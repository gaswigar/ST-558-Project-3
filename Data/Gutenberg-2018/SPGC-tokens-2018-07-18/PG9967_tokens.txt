waddington
of
wyck
i
barbara
wished
she
would
come
back
for
the
last
hour
fanny
waddington
had
kept
on
passing
in
and
out
of
the
room
through
the
open
door
into
the
garden
bringing
in
tulips
white
pink
and
red
tulips
for
the
flowered
lowestoft
bowls
hovering
over
them
caressing
them
with
her
delicate
butterfly
fingers
humming
some
sort
of
song
to
herself
the
song
mixes
itself
up
with
the
stores
list
barbara
was
making
two
dozen
glass
towels
twelve
pounds
of
spratt
puppy
biscuits
one
dozen
gent
pyjamas
extra
large
size
hoom
hoom
that
of
schubert
and
with
the
notes
barbara
was
writing
waddington
has
pleasure
in
enclosing
fanny
waddington
would
always
have
pleasure
in
enclosing
something
a
boom
hoom
hee
a
sound
so
light
that
it
hardly
stirred
the
quiet
of
the
room
if
a
butterfly
could
hum
it
would
hum
like
fanny
waddington
barbara
madden
had
not
been
two
days
at
lower
wyck
manor
and
already
she
was
at
home
there
she
knew
by
heart
fanny
with
the
low
stretch
of
the
tudor
windows
at
each
end
their
lattices
panelled
by
the
heavy
mullions
the
back
one
looking
out
on
to
the
green
garden
bordered
with
wallflowers
and
tulips
the
front
one
on
to
the
round
and
the
sundial
the
drive
and
the
shrubbery
beyond
down
the
broad
walk
that
cut
through
it
into
the
clear
reaches
of
the
park
she
liked
the
interior
the
persian
carpet
faded
to
patches
of
grey
and
fawn
and
old
rose
the
mahogany
furniture
the
tables
thrusting
out
the
brass
claws
of
their
legs
the
latticed
cabinets
and
bookcases
the
chintz
curtains
and
all
red
dahlias
and
parrots
on
a
ground
but
when
fanny
was
there
you
could
feel
the
room
ache
with
the
emptiness
she
left
barbara
ached
she
caught
herself
listening
for
fanny
waddington
feet
on
the
flagged
path
and
the
sound
of
her
humming
as
she
waited
she
looked
up
at
the
picture
over
the
bureau
in
the
recess
of
the
fireplace
the
portrait
in
oils
of
horatio
bysshe
waddington
husband
he
was
seated
heavily
seated
with
his
spread
width
and
folded
height
in
one
of
the
chairs
of
his
library
dressed
in
a
tweed
coat
riding
breeches
a
buff
waistcoat
and
a
tie
the
handsome
florid
face
was
lifted
in
a
noble
pose
above
the
stiff
white
collar
you
could
see
the
full
slightly
drooping
lower
lip
under
the
shaggy
black
moustache
there
was
solemnity
in
the
thick
rounded
salient
of
the
roman
nose
in
the
slightly
bulging
eyes
and
in
the
almost
imperceptible
line
that
sagged
from
each
nostril
down
the
long
curve
of
the
cheeks
this
figure
one
great
thigh
crossed
on
the
other
was
extraordinarily
solid
against
the
smoky
background
where
the
clipped
black
hair
made
a
watery
light
his
eyes
were
not
looking
at
anything
in
particular
horatio
bysshe
waddington
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
some
solemn
thought
his
wife
portrait
hung
over
the
in
the
other
recess
barbara
hoped
he
would
be
nice
she
hoped
he
would
be
interesting
since
she
had
to
be
his
secretary
but
of
course
he
would
be
anybody
so
enchanting
as
fanny
could
never
have
married
him
if
he
was
she
wondered
how
she
barbara
madden
would
play
her
double
part
of
secretary
to
him
and
companion
to
her
she
had
been
secretary
to
other
men
before
all
through
the
war
she
had
been
secretary
to
somebody
but
she
had
never
had
to
be
companion
to
their
wives
perhaps
it
was
a
good
thing
that
fanny
as
she
kept
on
reminding
her
had
secured
her
first
she
was
glad
he
was
there
when
she
arrived
and
would
be
till
the
day
after
he
had
wired
that
morning
to
tell
them
so
that
for
two
days
more
she
would
have
fanny
to
herself
well
what
do
you
think
of
him
fanny
had
come
back
into
the
room
she
was
hovering
behind
her
i
i
think
he
jolly
well
you
see
that
was
painted
seventeen
years
ago
he
was
young
then
has
he
changed
much
since
dear
me
no
said
fanny
he
has
changed
at
all
no
more
have
you
i
think
oh
in
seventeen
years
she
was
still
absurdly
like
her
portrait
after
seventeen
years
with
her
light
slender
body
poised
for
one
of
her
flights
her
quick
movements
of
butterfly
and
bird
with
her
small
white
face
the
terrier
nose
lifted
on
the
shadows
of
her
nostrils
her
eyes
that
gazed
at
you
close
under
the
low
black
eyebrows
her
brown
hair
that
sprang
in
two
sickles
from
the
peak
on
her
forehead
raking
up
to
the
backward
curve
of
the
chignon
a
profile
of
cyclamen
and
her
mouth
the
fine
lips
drawn
finer
by
her
enchanting
smile
all
these
features
set
in
such
strange
sensitive
unity
that
her
mouth
looked
at
you
and
her
eyes
said
things
no
matter
how
long
she
lived
she
would
always
be
young
oh
my
dear
child
she
said
you
are
so
like
your
mother
am
i
were
you
afraid
i
would
be
a
little
just
a
little
afraid
i
thought
you
be
modern
so
i
am
so
was
mother
not
when
i
knew
her
afterwards
then
a
sudden
thought
came
to
barbara
waddington
if
mother
was
your
dearest
friend
why
have
you
known
me
all
this
time
your
mother
and
i
lost
sight
of
each
other
before
you
were
born
mother
did
want
to
nor
i
mother
would
have
hated
you
to
think
she
did
i
never
thought
it
she
must
have
known
i
did
then
why
did
we
lose
sight
yes
why
people
do
if
they
can
help
it
if
they
care
enough
and
mother
cared
you
a
persistent
little
thing
are
you
are
you
trying
to
make
out
that
i
did
care
i
trying
to
make
you
see
that
mother
did
well
my
dear
we
both
cared
but
we
help
it
we
married
and
our
husbands
did
hit
it
off
did
they
and
daddy
was
so
nice
did
you
know
how
nice
he
was
oh
yes
i
knew
my
husband
was
nice
too
barbara
though
you
think
it
oh
but
i
do
i
sure
he
is
only
i
have
seen
him
yet
so
nice
but
said
fanny
pursuing
her
own
thought
he
never
made
a
joke
in
his
life
and
your
father
never
anything
else
daddy
did
jokes
they
came
to
him
i
seen
them
come
he
never
sent
any
of
them
away
no
matter
how
naughty
they
were
or
how
expensive
i
used
to
adore
his
jokes
but
horatio
did
he
did
like
my
adoring
them
so
you
see
i
see
i
wonder
said
barbara
looking
up
at
the
portrait
again
what
he
thinking
about
i
used
to
wonder
but
you
know
now
yes
i
know
now
fanny
said
what
happen
said
barbara
if
make
jokes
nothing
he
never
see
them
if
he
saw
daddy
oh
but
he
did
that
was
me
barbara
was
thoughtful
i
daresay
she
said
you
wo
keep
me
long
supposing
i
ca
do
the
work
the
fanny
eyes
were
interrogative
and
a
little
surprised
as
though
they
were
saying
who
said
work
what
work
well
waddington
work
i
got
to
help
him
with
his
book
have
i
oh
his
book
yes
he
writing
it
he
is
always
does
he
look
said
fanny
like
a
man
who
always
be
writing
a
book
no
i
ca
say
he
does
exactly
what
he
look
like
well
then
it
be
all
right
i
mean
shall
be
i
only
wondered
whether
i
could
really
do
what
he
wants
if
ralph
could
said
fanny
you
can
who
ralph
ralph
is
my
cousin
he
horatio
secretary
barbara
considered
it
did
make
jokes
then
lots
but
that
was
why
he
left
it
was
an
awful
pity
too
because
he
most
dreadfully
hard
up
if
he
hard
up
barbara
said
i
could
bear
to
think
i
done
him
out
of
a
job
you
have
he
had
to
go
fanny
turned
again
to
her
flowers
and
barbara
to
her
stores
list
are
you
sure
fanny
said
suddenly
you
put
striped
the
pyjamas
no
i
have
then
for
goodness
sake
put
it
supposing
they
sent
those
awful
futurist
things
why
he
frighten
me
into
fits
ca
you
see
horatio
stalking
in
out
of
his
all
magenta
blobs
and
forked
lightning
i
have
seen
him
at
all
yet
said
barbara
well
you
wait
does
my
humming
annoy
you
not
a
bit
i
like
it
it
such
a
happy
sound
i
always
do
it
said
fanny
when
i
happy
you
could
hear
feet
feet
in
heavy
soled
boots
clanking
on
the
drive
that
ringed
the
and
the
sundial
the
eager
feet
of
a
young
man
fanny
turned
her
head
listening
there
ralph
she
said
come
in
ralph
the
young
man
stood
in
the
low
narrow
doorway
filling
it
with
his
slender
height
and
breadth
he
looked
past
fanny
warily
into
the
far
corner
of
the
room
and
when
his
eyes
found
barbara
at
her
bureau
they
smiled
oh
in
fanny
said
he
is
here
he
wo
be
till
friday
this
is
ralph
bevan
barbara
and
this
is
barbara
madden
ralph
he
bowed
still
smiling
as
if
he
saw
something
irrepressibly
amusing
in
her
presence
there
yes
said
fanny
to
the
smile
your
successor
i
congratulate
you
miss
madden
do
be
an
ironical
beast
she
just
said
she
could
bear
to
think
she
done
you
out
of
your
job
well
i
could
said
barbara
that
very
nice
of
you
but
you
did
do
me
out
of
anything
it
was
the
act
of
god
it
was
horatio
act
not
that
miss
madden
meant
any
reflection
on
his
justice
and
his
mercy
i
do
know
about
his
justice
ralph
said
but
he
was
absolutely
merciful
when
he
fired
me
out
is
it
so
awfully
hard
then
said
barbara
you
may
not
find
it
so
oh
but
i
going
to
be
waddington
companion
too
you
be
all
right
then
they
would
let
be
that
he
means
you
be
safe
dear
you
wo
be
fired
out
whatever
happens
whatever
sort
of
secretary
i
am
yes
she
can
be
any
sort
she
likes
in
reason
ca
she
she
ca
be
a
worse
one
than
i
was
anyhow
barbara
was
aware
that
he
had
looked
at
her
a
long
look
half
thoughtful
half
amused
as
if
he
were
going
to
say
something
different
something
that
would
give
her
a
curious
light
on
herself
and
had
thought
better
of
it
fanny
waddington
was
protesting
my
dear
boy
it
was
for
incompetence
she
simply
dying
to
know
what
you
do
you
can
tell
her
he
wanted
to
write
horatio
book
for
him
and
horatio
would
let
him
that
was
all
oh
well
sha
want
to
write
it
barbara
said
we
thought
perhaps
you
would
said
fanny
but
barbara
had
turned
to
her
bureau
affecting
a
discreet
absorption
in
her
list
and
presently
ralph
bevan
went
out
into
the
garden
with
fanny
to
gather
more
tulips
ii
she
been
dying
to
know
what
he
had
done
but
now
after
ralph
had
stayed
to
lunch
and
tea
and
dinner
that
first
day
after
he
had
spent
all
yesterday
at
the
manor
and
after
he
had
turned
up
at
ten
in
the
morning
barbara
thought
she
had
made
out
the
history
though
they
had
been
very
discreet
and
fanny
had
insisted
on
reading
out
loud
half
the
time
ralph
of
course
was
in
love
with
his
cousin
fanny
to
be
sure
she
must
be
at
least
ten
years
older
than
he
was
but
that
would
matter
and
of
course
it
was
rather
naughty
of
him
but
then
again
very
likely
he
could
help
it
it
had
just
come
on
him
when
he
thinking
and
who
could
help
being
in
love
with
fanny
you
could
be
in
love
with
people
quite
innocently
and
hopelessly
there
was
no
sin
where
there
was
any
hope
and
perhaps
fanny
was
innocently
ever
so
innocently
in
love
with
him
or
if
she
was
horatio
thought
she
was
which
came
to
much
the
same
thing
so
that
anyhow
poor
ralph
had
to
go
the
explanation
they
had
given
barbara
thought
was
rather
thin
not
quite
worthy
of
their
admirable
intelligence
it
was
friday
barbara
fifth
day
she
was
walking
home
with
ralph
bevan
through
the
waddingtons
park
down
the
main
drive
that
led
from
to
lower
wyck
manor
it
would
be
surprising
she
thought
if
fanny
were
in
love
with
her
cousin
he
was
as
she
put
it
to
herself
so
distinctly
she
could
see
fanny
surrendering
first
to
his
sudden
laughter
his
quick
delighted
mind
his
innocent
engaging
frankness
he
would
she
thought
be
endlessly
amusing
endlessly
interesting
because
he
was
so
interested
so
amused
there
was
something
that
pleased
her
in
the
way
he
walked
hatless
his
head
thrown
back
his
shoulders
squared
his
hands
thrust
into
his
coat
pockets
safe
from
gesture
something
in
the
way
he
spun
round
in
his
path
to
face
her
with
his
laughter
he
had
fanny
terrier
nose
with
the
ghost
of
a
kink
in
it
his
dark
hair
grew
back
in
a
sickle
on
each
temple
it
would
lie
level
and
smooth
like
other
people
but
sprang
up
curled
from
the
clipping
his
eyes
were
his
own
dappled
eyes
green
and
grey
black
and
brown
sparkling
so
was
his
mouth
which
was
neither
too
thin
nor
too
thick
determination
in
the
thrusting
curve
of
that
lower
lip
and
his
chin
which
was
just
a
shade
too
big
for
it
a
shade
too
big
for
his
face
his
cheeks
were
sunburnt
and
a
little
shower
of
ochreish
freckles
spread
from
the
sunburn
and
peppered
the
slopes
of
his
nose
she
wanted
to
sketch
him
does
waddington
ever
go
for
walks
she
said
fanny
no
she
too
lazy
lazy
too
active
if
you
like
in
other
ways
how
long
have
you
known
her
just
five
days
five
yes
but
you
see
years
ago
she
was
my
mother
dearest
friend
how
i
came
to
be
their
secretary
when
she
saw
my
name
in
the
advertisement
she
thought
it
must
be
me
and
it
was
me
they
had
seen
each
other
for
years
and
years
my
father
and
waddington
did
hit
it
off
together
i
believe
you
have
seen
him
yet
no
there
seems
to
be
some
mystery
about
him
mystery
yes
what
is
it
or
may
you
tell
i
tell
it
would
be
kind
then
do
do
i
did
know
it
was
that
sort
of
thing
ralph
laughed
it
is
i
meant
it
would
be
kind
to
you
i
want
to
spoil
him
for
you
then
there
tell
me
one
thing
shall
i
get
on
with
him
all
right
do
ask
me
i
mean
will
he
be
awfully
difficult
to
work
with
because
he
sacked
me
no
only
you
must
let
on
that
you
know
better
than
he
does
and
if
you
want
to
keep
your
job
you
must
contradict
him
now
you
made
me
want
to
contradict
him
whatever
he
says
i
shall
have
to
say
the
other
thing
whether
i
agree
with
him
or
not
do
you
think
you
could
temporize
a
bit
for
her
sake
did
temporize
rather
i
was
as
meek
and
servile
as
i
knew
how
as
you
knew
how
do
you
think
i
shall
know
better
yes
you
a
woman
you
can
get
on
the
right
side
of
him
will
you
try
to
because
of
fanny
i
most
awfully
glad
she
got
you
and
i
want
you
to
stay
between
you
and
me
she
has
a
very
thin
time
with
waddington
there
it
is
i
know
i
know
i
i
going
to
hate
him
oh
no
you
not
you
ca
waddington
do
oh
lord
no
i
would
mind
him
a
bit
poor
old
thing
if
he
fanny
husband
he
had
almost
as
good
as
owned
it
almost
put
her
in
possession
of
their
secret
she
conceived
it
his
secret
fanny
secret
as
all
innocence
on
her
part
all
chivalry
on
his
tender
and
hopeless
and
pure
they
had
come
to
the
white
gate
that
led
between
the
shrubberies
and
the
with
the
stone
house
behind
it
it
was
nice
she
thought
of
fanny
to
make
bevan
take
her
for
these
long
walks
when
she
could
go
with
them
but
barbara
felt
all
the
time
that
she
ought
to
apologize
to
the
young
man
for
not
being
fanny
especially
when
waddington
was
coming
back
by
the
train
and
this
afternoon
would
be
their
last
for
goodness
knew
how
long
and
as
they
talked
about
ralph
life
before
the
war
and
the
jobs
he
had
lost
because
of
it
he
had
been
a
journalist
and
about
job
at
the
war
office
and
air
raids
and
the
games
they
both
went
in
for
and
their
favourite
authors
and
the
room
he
had
in
the
white
hart
inn
at
wyck
as
they
talked
fluently
with
the
ease
of
old
acquaintances
almost
of
old
friends
barbara
admired
the
beauty
of
bevan
manners
you
would
have
supposed
that
instead
of
suffering
as
he
must
be
suffering
agonies
of
impatience
and
irritation
he
had
never
enjoyed
anything
in
his
life
so
much
as
this
adventure
that
was
just
coming
to
an
end
he
had
opened
the
gate
for
her
and
now
stood
with
his
back
to
it
holding
out
his
hand
saying
are
you
coming
in
she
said
waddington
expects
you
for
tea
no
he
said
she
does
she
knows
i
ca
come
if
he
there
he
paused
by
the
way
that
book
of
his
it
in
an
appalling
muddle
i
had
time
to
do
much
to
it
before
i
left
if
you
ca
get
it
straight
you
must
come
to
me
and
i
help
you
that
very
good
of
you
rather
not
it
my
job
you
know
he
was
backing
through
the
gate
saluting
as
he
went
and
now
he
had
turned
and
was
running
with
raking
athletic
paces
up
the
grass
border
of
the
park
iii
tea
is
in
the
library
miss
this
announcement
together
with
partridge
extraordinary
increase
of
importance
would
have
told
her
that
the
master
had
returned
even
if
she
had
not
seen
through
the
door
of
the
waddington
overcoat
hanging
by
its
shoulders
and
surmounted
by
his
grey
slouch
hat
with
a
rapid
furtive
movement
the
butler
closed
the
door
on
these
sanctities
and
she
noted
the
subdued
quiet
of
his
footsteps
as
he
led
the
way
down
the
dark
corridor
through
the
and
into
the
library
beyond
she
also
caught
a
surprising
sight
of
her
own
face
in
the
glass
over
the
chimneypiece
her
dark
eyes
shining
the
cool
flush
on
her
young
cheeks
the
curled
mouth
flowering
geranium
red
on
rose
white
this
barbara
of
the
smiled
at
her
in
passing
with
such
gay
irresponsible
amusement
that
it
fairly
took
her
breath
away
its
origin
became
clear
to
her
as
ralph
bevan
words
shot
into
her
mind
i
do
want
to
spoil
him
for
you
she
foresaw
a
possible
intimacy
in
which
horatio
bysshe
waddington
would
become
the
unique
though
unofficial
tie
between
them
she
was
aware
that
it
pleased
her
to
share
a
secret
jest
with
ralph
bevan
she
found
fanny
established
behind
her
in
the
low
room
dim
with
its
oak
panelling
above
the
long
lines
of
the
bookcases
where
fanny
fluttering
smile
made
movement
and
a
sort
of
light
her
husband
sat
facing
her
in
his
brown
leather
chair
and
in
the
pose
the
wonderful
pose
of
his
portrait
only
the
sobriety
of
his
serge
had
fined
it
down
giving
him
a
factitious
slenderness
he
seen
her
come
in
he
sat
there
in
innocence
and
unawareness
and
afterwards
it
gave
her
a
little
pang
of
remorse
remembering
how
innocent
he
had
then
seemed
to
her
and
unaware
this
is
my
husband
barbara
horatio
you
have
met
miss
madden
his
eyes
bulged
with
the
startled
innocence
of
a
creature
taken
unaware
he
had
just
lifted
his
face
with
its
dripping
moustache
from
his
teacup
and
though
he
carried
off
this
awkwardness
with
an
unabashed
sweep
of
his
you
could
see
that
he
was
sensitive
he
hated
you
to
catch
him
in
any
gesture
that
was
less
than
noble
all
his
gestures
were
noble
and
his
attitudes
he
was
noble
as
he
got
up
slowly
unfolding
his
great
height
tightening
by
a
movement
of
his
shoulders
his
great
breadth
he
looked
down
at
her
superbly
and
held
out
his
hand
it
closed
on
hers
in
a
large
genial
clasp
so
this
is
my
secretary
is
it
yes
and
do
forget
she
my
companion
as
well
as
your
secretary
i
never
forget
anything
that
you
wish
me
to
remember
only
he
said
nevah
and
remembah
he
bowed
as
he
said
it
in
a
very
courtly
way
barbara
noticed
that
his
black
hair
and
moustache
were
lightly
grizzled
there
was
loose
flesh
about
his
eyelids
his
chin
had
doubled
and
his
cheeks
were
sagging
from
the
bone
otherwise
he
was
exactly
like
his
portrait
these
changes
made
him
look
if
anything
more
incorruptibly
dignified
and
more
solemn
he
had
remained
on
his
feet
for
his
breeding
was
perfect
moving
between
the
and
barbara
bringing
her
tea
milk
and
sugar
and
things
to
eat
altogether
he
was
so
simple
so
genial
and
unmysterious
that
barbara
could
only
suppose
that
ralph
had
been
making
fun
of
her
of
her
wonder
her
curiosity
my
dear
what
a
colour
you
got
fanny
put
up
her
hands
to
her
own
cheeks
to
draw
attention
to
barbara
you
growing
a
country
girl
are
you
you
should
have
seen
her
white
face
when
she
came
horatio
what
has
she
been
doing
to
herself
he
had
settled
again
into
his
chair
and
his
attitude
she
been
out
walking
with
ralph
with
ralph
is
here
still
why
should
he
be
waddington
shrugged
his
immense
shoulders
it
a
question
of
taste
if
he
to
hang
about
the
place
after
his
behaviour
poor
boy
whatever
has
he
done
makes
it
sound
as
if
it
had
been
something
awful
we
need
go
into
it
i
think
but
you
going
into
it
darling
all
the
time
do
you
mean
to
keep
it
up
against
him
for
ever
i
not
keeping
anything
up
what
ralph
bevan
does
is
no
concern
of
mine
since
i
not
to
be
inconvenienced
by
it
since
miss
madden
has
come
to
my
rescue
so
charmingly
i
shall
not
give
it
another
thought
he
turned
to
barbara
as
to
a
change
of
subject
had
you
any
difficulty
his
voice
was
measured
and
important
in
finding
your
way
here
none
at
all
ah
that
train
is
excellent
excellent
but
if
you
had
not
told
the
guard
to
stop
at
the
hill
you
would
have
been
carried
on
to
cheltenham
which
would
have
been
very
awkward
for
you
very
awkward
indeed
my
dear
horatio
what
did
you
suppose
she
do
my
dear
fanny
there
are
many
things
she
might
have
done
she
might
have
got
into
the
wrong
coach
at
paddington
and
been
carried
on
to
worcester
and
that
said
barbara
would
have
been
much
worse
than
cheltenham
the
very
thought
of
it
said
fanny
makes
me
shudder
but
thank
god
barbara
you
did
do
any
of
those
things
waddington
shifted
the
crossing
of
his
legs
as
a
big
dog
shifts
his
paws
when
you
laugh
at
him
the
more
fanny
laughed
the
more
dignified
and
solemn
he
became
you
have
told
me
yet
horatio
what
you
did
in
london
i
was
just
going
to
tell
you
when
miss
madden
so
delightfully
came
in
at
that
barbara
thought
it
discreet
to
dismiss
herself
but
fanny
called
her
back
what
are
you
running
away
for
he
did
do
anything
in
london
he
would
like
you
to
hear
about
on
the
contrary
i
particularly
wish
miss
madden
to
hear
about
it
i
am
starting
a
branch
of
the
national
league
of
liberty
in
wyck
you
may
have
heard
of
it
yes
i
of
it
i
even
seen
the
prospectus
good
well
fanny
i
lunched
yesterday
with
sir
maurice
gedge
and
as
keen
as
mustard
he
agrees
with
me
that
the
league
will
be
no
good
no
good
at
all
until
it
taken
up
strong
in
the
provinces
he
wants
me
to
start
at
once
just
as
soon
as
i
can
get
my
committee
my
dear
if
you
got
to
have
a
committee
first
you
never
start
it
depends
altogether
on
who
i
get
and
it
be
committee
sir
maurice
was
very
emphatic
about
that
he
agrees
with
me
that
if
you
want
a
thing
done
and
done
well
you
must
do
it
yourself
there
can
only
be
moving
spirit
the
committee
will
have
nothing
to
do
but
carry
out
my
ideas
then
be
sure
you
get
a
committee
that
has
any
of
its
own
that
will
not
be
difficult
said
waddington
in
wyck
the
first
thing
is
the
prospectus
that
where
you
come
in
miss
madden
you
mean
the
first
thing
is
that
barbara
draws
up
the
prospectus
under
my
supervision
the
next
thing
fanny
said
is
to
conceal
your
prospectus
from
your
committee
till
it
in
print
you
come
to
your
committee
with
your
prospectus
you
do
offer
it
for
discussion
supposing
barbara
said
they
insist
on
discussing
it
they
wo
said
fanny
once
it
printed
especially
if
it
paid
for
you
must
get
pyecraft
to
send
in
his
bill
at
once
and
if
they
start
discussing
you
can
put
them
off
with
the
date
and
place
of
the
meeting
and
the
wording
of
the
posters
that
give
them
something
to
talk
about
i
suppose
you
be
chairman
well
i
think
in
the
circumstances
they
could
hardly
appoint
anybody
else
i
do
know
somebody
might
suggest
sir
john
corbett
waddington
face
sagged
with
dismay
as
fanny
presented
this
unpleasant
possibility
i
do
think
sir
john
would
care
about
it
i
shall
suggest
it
to
him
myself
but
i
do
think
after
all
sir
john
corbett
was
a
lazy
man
when
you
roused
sir
john
if
you
ever
rouse
him
then
have
to
round
up
all
the
towns
and
villages
for
twenty
miles
it
a
pity
you
ca
have
ralph
he
would
have
rounded
them
for
you
in
no
time
on
his
i
am
quite
capable
of
rounding
them
all
up
myself
thank
you
well
dear
said
fanny
placably
it
keep
you
busy
for
the
next
six
months
and
that
be
nice
you
wo
miss
the
war
then
so
much
will
you
the
yes
you
do
miss
it
darling
he
was
a
special
constable
barbara
and
he
sat
on
tribunals
and
he
drove
his
like
mad
on
government
service
he
had
no
end
of
a
time
it
no
use
your
saying
you
enjoy
it
horatio
for
you
did
i
was
glad
to
be
of
service
to
my
country
as
much
as
any
soldier
but
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
the
war
if
there
had
been
a
war
there
would
have
been
any
service
to
be
glad
about
my
dear
fanny
it
a
perfectly
horrible
suggestion
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
would
have
brought
about
that
that
infamous
tragedy
that
i
would
have
sent
thousands
and
thousands
of
our
lads
to
their
deaths
to
get
a
job
for
myself
if
i
thought
for
one
moment
that
you
were
serious
you
do
like
me
to
be
anything
else
dear
i
certainly
do
like
you
to
joke
about
such
subjects
oh
come
said
fanny
we
all
enjoyed
our
war
jobs
except
poor
ralph
who
got
gassed
first
thing
and
concussed
with
a
oh
did
he
said
barbara
he
did
and
do
you
think
horatio
considering
the
rotten
time
had
and
that
he
lost
a
lucrative
job
through
the
war
and
that
done
him
out
of
his
secretaryship
do
you
think
you
might
forgive
him
of
course
said
horatio
i
forgive
him
he
had
got
up
to
go
and
had
reached
the
door
when
fanny
called
him
back
and
i
can
write
and
ask
him
to
come
and
dine
night
ca
i
i
want
to
be
quite
sure
that
he
dine
i
have
never
said
or
implied
said
horatio
that
he
was
not
to
come
and
dine
with
that
he
left
them
the
beautiful
thing
about
horatio
said
fanny
is
that
he
never
bears
a
grudge
against
people
no
matter
what
he
done
to
them
i
no
doubt
that
ralph
was
excessively
provoking
and
put
him
in
the
wrong
and
yet
though
he
was
in
the
wrong
and
knows
he
was
in
it
he
does
resent
it
he
does
resent
it
the
least
little
bit
barbara
wondered
how
and
where
she
would
be
expected
to
spend
her
evenings
now
that
fanny
husband
had
come
home
being
secretary
to
waddington
and
companion
to
fanny
would
mean
being
companion
to
both
of
them
at
once
so
when
horatio
appeared
in
the
after
coffee
she
asked
if
she
might
sit
in
the
and
write
letters
do
you
want
to
sit
in
the
said
fanny
well
i
ought
to
write
those
letters
there
a
fire
in
the
library
you
can
write
there
ca
she
horatio
waddington
looked
up
with
the
benign
expression
he
had
had
when
he
came
on
barbara
alone
in
the
before
dinner
a
look
so
directed
to
her
neck
and
shoulders
that
it
told
her
how
well
her
evening
frock
became
her
she
shall
sit
anywhere
she
likes
the
library
is
hers
whenever
she
wants
to
use
it
barbara
thought
she
would
rather
like
the
library
as
she
went
she
could
help
seeing
a
look
on
fanny
face
that
pleaded
that
would
have
kept
her
with
her
she
thought
she
does
want
to
be
alone
with
him
she
judged
it
better
to
ignore
that
look
she
had
been
about
an
hour
in
the
library
she
had
written
her
letters
and
chosen
a
book
and
curled
herself
up
in
the
big
leather
chair
and
was
reading
when
waddington
came
in
he
took
no
notice
of
her
at
first
but
established
himself
at
the
with
his
back
to
her
he
would
of
course
want
her
to
go
she
uncurled
herself
and
went
quietly
to
the
door
waddington
looked
up
you
need
go
he
said
something
in
his
face
made
her
wonder
whether
she
ought
to
stay
she
remembered
that
she
was
waddington
companion
waddington
may
want
me
waddington
has
gone
to
bed
do
go
unless
you
tired
getting
my
thoughts
on
paper
and
i
may
want
you
she
remembered
that
she
was
waddington
secretary
she
went
back
to
her
chair
it
was
only
his
face
that
had
made
her
wonder
his
great
back
bent
to
his
task
was
like
another
person
there
absorbed
and
unmoved
it
chaperoned
them
from
time
to
time
she
heard
brief
scratches
of
his
pen
as
he
got
a
thought
down
it
was
ten
when
the
struck
waddington
gave
a
thick
ha
of
irritation
and
got
up
it
no
use
he
said
i
not
in
form
i
suppose
it
the
journey
he
came
to
the
fireplace
and
sat
down
heavily
in
the
opposite
chair
barbara
was
aware
of
his
eyes
considering
appraising
her
my
wife
tells
me
she
has
had
a
delightful
time
with
you
i
had
a
delightful
time
with
her
i
glad
my
wife
is
a
very
delightful
woman
but
you
know
you
must
take
everything
she
says
too
seriously
i
wo
i
not
a
very
serious
person
myself
do
say
that
do
say
that
very
well
i
think
if
you
do
want
me
i
say
good
night
seriously
seriously
he
had
risen
as
she
rose
and
went
to
open
the
door
for
her
he
escorted
her
through
the
and
stood
there
at
the
further
door
holding
out
his
hand
benignant
and
superbly
solemn
good
night
then
he
said
she
told
herself
that
she
was
wrong
quite
wrong
about
his
poor
old
face
there
was
nothing
in
it
nothing
but
that
grave
and
unadventurous
benignity
his
mood
had
been
she
judged
purely
paternal
paternal
and
childlike
too
pathetic
if
you
came
to
think
of
it
in
his
clinging
to
her
presence
her
companionship
it
must
have
been
my
little
evil
mind
she
thought
as
she
went
along
the
corridor
she
remembered
she
had
left
her
knitting
in
the
she
turned
to
fetch
it
and
found
fanny
still
there
wide
awake
with
her
feet
on
the
fender
and
reading
oh
waddington
i
thought
you
gone
to
bed
so
did
i
dear
but
i
changed
my
mind
when
i
found
myself
alone
with
wells
he
too
heavenly
for
words
barbara
saw
it
in
a
flash
then
she
knew
what
she
the
companion
and
secretary
was
there
for
she
was
there
to
keep
him
off
her
so
that
fanny
might
have
more
time
to
find
herself
alone
in
she
saw
it
all
she
said
was
what
you
sent
me
out
with
bevan
for
it
was
how
clever
of
you
barbara
iv
waddington
closed
the
door
on
miss
madden
slowly
and
gently
so
that
the
action
should
not
strike
her
as
dismissive
he
then
turned
on
the
lights
by
the
chimneypiece
and
stood
there
looking
at
himself
in
the
glass
he
wanted
to
know
exactly
how
his
face
had
presented
itself
to
miss
madden
it
would
not
be
altogether
as
it
appeared
to
himself
for
the
glass
unlike
the
young
girl
clear
eyes
was
an
exaggerating
and
distorting
medium
he
had
noticed
that
his
wife
face
in
the
glass
looked
a
good
ten
years
older
than
the
face
he
knew
he
calculated
therefore
that
this
faint
greenish
tint
this
slightly
elderly
grimace
were
not
truthful
renderings
of
his
complexion
and
his
smile
and
as
in
spite
of
these
defects
which
you
could
put
down
to
the
account
of
the
glass
the
face
waddington
saw
was
still
the
face
of
a
handsome
man
he
formed
a
very
favourable
opinion
of
the
face
miss
madden
had
seen
handsome
and
if
not
in
his
first
youth
then
still
in
his
second
experience
is
itself
a
fascination
and
if
a
man
has
any
charm
at
all
his
second
youth
should
be
more
charming
more
irresistibly
fascinating
than
his
first
and
the
child
had
been
conscious
of
him
she
had
betrayed
uneasiness
a
sense
of
danger
when
she
had
found
herself
alone
with
him
he
recalled
her
first
tentative
flight
her
hesitation
he
would
have
liked
to
have
kept
her
there
with
him
a
little
longer
to
have
talked
to
her
about
his
league
to
have
tested
by
a
few
shrewd
questions
her
ability
better
not
better
not
the
child
was
wise
and
right
her
wisdom
and
rectitude
were
delicious
to
waddington
still
more
so
was
the
thought
that
she
had
felt
him
to
be
dangerous
he
went
back
into
his
library
and
sat
again
in
his
chair
and
meditated
this
experiment
of
fanny
now
he
wondered
how
it
would
turn
out
especially
if
fanny
really
wanted
to
adopt
the
girl
frank
daughter
that
impudent
social
comedian
had
been
so
offensive
to
waddington
in
his
that
there
was
something
alluring
in
the
idea
of
keeping
his
daughter
now
that
he
was
dead
seeing
the
exquisite
little
thing
dependent
on
him
for
everything
for
food
and
frocks
and
but
no
doubt
they
had
been
wise
in
giving
her
the
secretaryship
before
committing
themselves
to
the
irrecoverable
step
thus
testing
her
in
a
relation
that
could
be
easily
terminated
if
by
any
chance
it
proved
embarrassing
but
the
relation
in
itself
was
as
waddington
put
it
to
himself
a
little
difficult
and
delicate
it
involved
an
intimacy
a
closer
intimacy
than
adoption
having
her
there
in
his
library
at
all
hours
to
work
with
him
and
always
that
little
uneasy
consciousness
of
hers
well
well
he
had
set
the
tone
for
all
their
future
intercourse
he
had
in
the
most
delicate
way
possible
let
her
see
it
seemed
to
him
looking
back
on
it
that
he
had
exercised
a
perfect
tact
parting
from
her
with
that
air
of
gaiety
and
light
badinage
which
his
own
instinct
of
so
happily
suggested
yet
he
smiled
when
he
recalled
her
look
as
she
went
from
him
backing
backing
to
the
door
it
made
him
feel
very
tender
and
chivalrous
virtuous
too
as
if
somehow
he
had
overcome
some
unforeseen
and
ruinous
impulse
and
all
the
time
he
had
had
any
impulse
beyond
the
craving
to
talk
to
an
intelligent
and
attractive
stranger
to
talk
about
his
league
waddington
went
to
bed
thinking
about
it
he
even
woke
his
wife
up
out
of
her
sleep
with
the
request
that
she
would
remind
him
to
call
at
underwoods
first
thing
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
he
was
awake
he
thought
of
underwoods
underwoods
was
important
he
had
to
round
up
the
county
and
he
could
do
that
without
first
consulting
sir
john
corbett
of
underwoods
as
a
matter
of
form
a
mere
matter
of
form
of
course
he
would
have
to
consult
him
but
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
less
he
liked
the
idea
of
consulting
anybody
he
was
desperately
afraid
that
if
he
once
began
letting
people
into
it
his
scheme
his
league
would
be
taken
away
from
him
and
that
the
proper
thing
the
graceful
thing
the
thing
to
which
he
would
be
impelled
by
all
his
instincts
and
traditions
would
be
to
stand
modestly
back
and
see
it
go
probably
into
sir
john
hands
and
he
could
he
could
yet
it
was
clear
that
the
league
just
because
it
was
a
league
must
have
members
even
if
he
had
been
prepared
to
contribute
all
the
funds
himself
and
carry
on
the
whole
business
of
it
it
could
consist
solely
of
waddington
of
wyck
his
problem
was
a
subtle
and
difficult
one
how
to
identify
himself
with
the
league
himself
alone
in
a
unique
and
indissoluble
manner
and
yet
draw
to
it
the
necessary
supporters
how
to
control
every
detail
of
its
intricate
working
there
would
be
endless
wheels
within
wheels
and
at
the
same
time
give
proper
powers
to
the
inevitable
committee
if
he
did
not
put
it
quite
so
crudely
as
fanny
in
her
disagreeable
irony
his
problem
resolved
itself
into
this
how
to
divide
the
work
and
yet
rake
in
all
the
credit
he
was
saved
from
its
immediate
pressure
by
the
sight
of
the
envelope
that
waited
for
him
on
the
addressed
in
a
familiar
hand
levitt
his
emotion
betrayed
itself
to
barbara
in
a
peculiar
furtive
yet
triumphant
smile
again
said
fanny
there
was
no
end
to
the
woman
and
her
letters
levitt
requested
waddington
to
call
on
her
that
morning
at
eleven
there
was
a
matter
on
which
she
desired
to
consult
him
the
brevity
of
the
note
revealed
her
trust
in
his
compliance
trust
that
implied
again
a
certain
intimacy
waddington
read
it
out
loud
to
show
how
harmless
and
open
was
his
communion
with
levitt
is
there
any
matter
on
which
she
has
not
consulted
you
there
seems
to
have
been
one
and
as
you
see
she
is
repairing
the
omission
a
light
air
a
light
air
to
carry
off
levitt
the
light
air
that
had
carried
off
barbara
that
had
made
barbara
carry
herself
off
the
night
before
it
had
done
good
this
morning
the
young
girl
was
all
ease
and
innocent
unconsciousness
again
and
i
suppose
you
going
fanny
said
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
then
i
shall
have
barbara
to
myself
all
morning
you
will
have
barbara
to
yourself
all
day
he
tried
thus
jocosely
to
convey
for
barbara
good
his
indifference
to
having
her
all
the
same
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
say
her
name
like
that
barbara
he
was
not
sure
that
he
wanted
to
go
and
see
levitt
with
all
this
business
of
the
league
on
hand
it
meant
putting
off
sir
john
you
could
do
sir
john
levitt
in
one
morning
besides
he
thought
he
knew
what
levitt
wanted
and
he
said
to
himself
that
this
time
he
would
be
obliged
for
once
to
refuse
her
but
it
was
not
in
him
to
refuse
to
go
and
see
her
so
he
went
as
he
walked
up
the
park
drive
to
the
town
he
recalled
with
distinctly
pleasurable
emotion
the
first
time
he
had
encountered
levitt
the
vision
of
the
smart
little
lady
who
had
stood
there
by
the
inner
gate
the
gate
that
led
from
the
park
into
the
grounds
waiting
for
his
approach
with
happy
confidence
he
remembered
her
smile
an
affair
of
teeth
in
an
face
and
her
frank
attack
forgive
me
if
i
trespassing
they
told
me
there
was
a
right
of
way
he
remembered
her
charming
diffidence
the
naïve
reverence
for
his
grounds
which
had
compelled
him
to
escort
her
personally
through
them
her
attitudes
of
admiration
as
the
manor
burst
on
her
from
its
bay
in
the
beech
trees
the
interest
she
had
shown
in
its
date
and
architecture
and
how
spinning
out
the
agreeable
interview
he
had
gone
with
her
all
the
way
to
the
farther
gate
that
led
into
lower
wyck
village
and
how
she
had
challenged
him
there
with
her
you
must
be
waddington
of
wyck
and
capped
his
admission
with
i
mrs
levitt
to
which
he
had
replied
that
he
was
delighted
and
the
time
after
that
partridge
had
discreetly
shown
her
into
the
library
when
she
had
called
to
implore
him
to
obtain
exemption
for
her
son
toby
her
black
eyes
bright
and
large
behind
tears
and
her
cry
i
a
war
widow
waddington
and
he
my
only
child
the
flattery
of
her
belief
that
he
waddington
of
wyck
had
the
chief
power
on
the
tribunal
and
indeed
it
would
have
been
folly
to
pretend
that
he
had
not
power
that
he
could
not
work
it
if
he
chose
and
the
third
time
after
he
had
worked
it
and
she
had
come
to
thank
him
tears
again
the
pressure
of
a
plump
hand
a
tingling
delicious
memory
after
that
his
untiring
efforts
to
get
a
war
job
for
toby
there
had
been
difficulties
entailing
many
visits
to
levitt
in
the
little
house
in
the
market
square
of
but
in
the
end
he
had
had
the
same
intoxicating
experience
of
his
power
all
obstructions
going
down
before
waddington
of
wyck
and
this
year
when
toby
was
finally
demobilized
it
was
only
natural
that
she
should
draw
on
waddington
influence
again
to
get
him
a
permanent
peace
job
he
had
got
it
and
that
meant
more
visits
and
more
gratitude
till
here
he
was
attached
to
levitt
by
the
unbreakable
tie
of
his
benefactions
he
was
even
attached
to
her
son
toby
whose
continued
existence
to
say
nothing
of
his
activity
in
bank
at
wyck
was
a
perpetual
tribute
to
his
power
waddington
had
nothing
like
the
same
complacence
in
thinking
of
his
own
son
horace
but
then
horace
existence
and
his
activity
were
not
a
tribute
but
a
menace
a
standing
danger
not
only
to
his
power
but
to
his
fascination
his
sense
of
himself
as
a
still
young
still
brilliant
and
effective
personality
horace
inherited
his
mother
deplorable
lack
of
seriousness
and
it
was
in
levitt
society
that
waddington
was
most
conscious
of
his
youth
his
brilliance
and
effect
with
an
agreeable
sense
of
anticipation
he
climbed
up
the
slopes
of
sheep
street
and
park
street
and
so
into
the
square
the
house
muffled
in
ivy
hid
discreetly
in
the
far
corner
behind
the
two
tall
elms
on
the
green
trinder
the
landlady
had
a
sidelong
bend
of
the
head
and
a
smile
that
acknowledged
him
as
waddington
of
wyck
and
levitt
benefactor
and
as
he
waited
in
the
low
room
he
reminded
himself
that
he
had
come
to
refuse
her
request
if
as
he
suspected
it
was
the
ballingers
cottage
that
she
wanted
to
be
sure
the
ballingers
had
notice
to
quit
in
june
but
he
could
very
well
turn
the
ballingers
out
if
they
wanted
to
stay
when
there
was
a
decent
house
in
the
place
to
turn
them
into
he
would
have
to
make
this
very
clear
to
levitt
not
that
he
approved
of
ballinger
the
fellow
one
of
his
best
farm
hands
had
behaved
infamously
first
of
all
demanding
preposterous
wages
and
then
just
because
waddington
had
refused
to
be
leaving
his
service
for
colonel
grainger
colonel
grainger
had
behaved
infamously
buying
foss
bank
with
the
money
he
had
made
in
high
explosives
and
then
letting
fly
his
confounded
socialism
all
over
the
county
knowing
nothing
mind
you
about
local
conditions
and
actually
raising
the
rate
of
wages
without
consulting
anybody
and
upsetting
the
farm
labourers
for
miles
round
at
a
time
when
the
prosperity
of
the
entire
country
depended
on
the
farmers
still
waddington
was
not
the
man
to
take
a
petty
revenge
on
his
inferiors
he
did
blame
ballinger
he
blamed
colonel
grainger
he
would
like
to
see
grainger
boycotted
by
the
whole
county
the
door
opened
he
strode
forward
and
found
himself
holding
out
a
sudden
fervid
hand
to
a
lady
who
was
not
levitt
he
drew
up
turning
his
gesture
into
a
bow
rather
unnecessarily
ceremonious
but
he
could
not
annihilate
instantaneously
all
that
fervour
i
am
levitt
sister
rickards
waddington
is
it
not
i
tell
elise
you
here
i
know
she
be
glad
to
see
you
she
has
been
very
much
upset
she
remained
standing
before
him
long
enough
for
him
to
be
aware
of
a
projecting
bust
of
white
serge
of
smartness
of
purplish
copper
hair
a
raking
panama
white
brim
of
eyebrows
a
rouged
smile
and
a
smell
of
orris
root
before
he
could
grasp
its
connexion
with
levitt
this
amazing
figure
had
disappeared
and
given
place
to
a
tapping
of
heels
and
a
furtive
scuffling
laugh
on
the
stairs
outside
a
shriller
laugh
that
must
be
rickards
a
long
then
the
bang
of
the
front
door
covering
the
lady
retreat
and
levitt
came
in
stifling
merriment
under
a
minute
he
took
it
in
then
they
were
sisters
rickards
and
elise
levitt
elise
if
you
cared
to
be
critical
had
the
same
defects
short
legs
loose
hips
the
same
exaggerations
the
toppling
breasts
underpinned
by
the
shafts
of
her
stays
not
waddington
taste
and
yet
and
yet
elise
had
contrived
a
charming
and
handsome
effect
out
of
black
eyes
and
the
teeth
in
the
face
the
play
of
the
black
eyebrows
distracted
you
from
the
equine
bend
of
the
nose
that
sprang
between
them
the
movements
of
her
mouth
the
white
flash
of
its
smile
made
you
forget
its
thinness
and
hardness
and
the
slight
heaviness
of
its
jaw
something
foreign
about
her
something
french
piquant
and
then
her
clothes
levitt
wore
a
coat
and
skirt
her
sister
white
serge
with
a
distinction
a
greyish
stripe
or
something
clean
straightness
that
stiffened
and
fined
down
her
exuberance
one
jewel
one
bit
of
gold
and
she
might
have
been
vulgar
but
no
he
thought
she
knows
what
becomes
her
immaculate
purity
of
white
gloves
white
shoes
white
panama
and
the
black
points
of
the
ribbon
of
her
eyebrows
her
eyes
and
hair
after
all
the
sort
of
woman
waddington
liked
to
be
seen
out
walking
with
she
made
him
feel
slender
my
waddington
how
good
of
you
my
dear
levitt
always
delighted
when
it
possible
to
do
anything
as
she
covered
him
with
her
brilliant
eyes
he
tightened
his
shoulders
and
stood
firm
while
his
spirit
braced
itself
against
persuasion
if
it
was
the
ballingers
cottage
i
really
am
ashamed
of
myself
i
never
seem
to
send
for
you
unless
in
trouble
is
that
the
time
his
voice
thickened
so
long
as
you
do
send
he
thought
it
is
the
ballingers
cottage
then
it
your
own
fault
you
always
been
so
good
so
kind
to
my
poor
toby
nothing
to
do
with
toby
i
hope
the
trouble
oh
no
no
and
yet
in
a
way
it
has
i
afraid
waddington
i
may
have
to
leave
to
leave
leave
wyck
leave
dear
wyck
not
seriously
he
was
prepared
for
that
the
idea
hit
him
hard
in
a
place
that
he
had
thought
was
tender
quite
seriously
dear
me
this
is
very
distressing
very
distressing
indeed
but
you
would
not
take
such
a
step
without
consulting
your
friends
i
consulting
you
yes
yes
but
have
you
thought
it
well
over
thinking
is
any
use
i
shall
have
to
unless
something
can
be
done
he
thought
financial
difficulties
debts
an
expensive
lady
unless
something
could
be
done
he
did
know
that
he
was
exactly
prepared
to
do
it
but
his
tongue
answered
in
spite
of
him
something
must
be
done
we
ca
let
you
go
like
this
my
dear
lady
that
it
i
do
see
how
i
go
with
dear
toby
here
nor
yet
how
i
to
stay
wo
you
tell
me
what
the
trouble
is
the
trouble
is
that
trinder
son
just
been
demobilized
and
she
wants
our
rooms
for
his
wife
and
family
come
surely
we
can
find
other
rooms
all
the
best
ones
are
taken
there
nothing
left
that
i
care
to
live
in
besides
it
is
rooms
i
want
waddington
it
a
house
it
was
of
course
the
ballingers
cottage
but
she
could
have
it
she
could
have
it
i
would
mind
how
small
it
was
if
only
i
had
a
little
home
of
my
own
you
do
know
waddington
what
it
is
to
be
without
a
home
of
your
own
i
have
had
a
home
for
years
five
years
not
since
the
war
i
afraid
said
waddington
at
present
there
is
a
house
for
you
in
wyck
he
brooded
earnestly
as
though
he
were
trying
to
conjure
up
to
create
out
of
nothing
a
house
for
her
and
a
home
no
but
i
understand
that
the
ballingers
will
be
leaving
in
june
you
said
that
at
any
time
if
you
had
a
house
i
should
have
it
i
said
a
house
levitt
not
a
cottage
it
all
the
same
to
me
the
ballingers
cottage
could
be
made
into
an
adorable
little
house
it
could
with
a
few
hundred
pounds
spent
on
it
well
you
be
improving
your
property
would
you
and
you
get
it
back
in
the
higher
rent
i
not
thinking
about
getting
anything
back
and
nothing
would
please
me
better
only
you
see
i
ca
very
well
turn
ballinger
out
as
long
as
he
behaves
himself
i
would
have
him
turned
out
for
the
world
but
do
you
consider
that
ballinger
behaved
himself
well
he
played
me
a
dirty
trick
perhaps
when
he
went
to
grainger
but
if
grainger
can
afford
to
pay
for
him
i
no
right
to
object
to
his
being
bought
it
is
a
reason
for
turning
the
man
out
i
do
see
how
he
can
expect
you
to
refuse
a
good
tenant
for
him
i
must
if
i
have
a
good
house
to
put
him
into
he
does
expect
it
waddington
did
you
give
him
notice
in
december
a
mere
matter
of
form
he
knows
he
can
stay
on
if
there
nowhere
else
for
him
to
go
to
then
why
said
levitt
does
he
go
about
saying
that
he
dares
you
to
let
the
cottage
over
his
head
does
he
does
he
say
that
he
says
he
pay
you
out
he
summons
you
he
was
most
abusive
waddington
face
positively
swelled
with
the
choleric
flush
that
swamped
its
genial
fatuity
it
seems
somebody
told
him
you
were
going
to
do
up
the
cottage
and
let
it
for
more
rent
i
do
know
who
could
have
spread
that
story
i
assure
you
waddington
it
was
me
my
dear
levitt
of
course
i
wo
say
i
was
thinking
of
it
and
that
i
would
have
done
it
if
i
could
have
got
rid
of
ballinger
he
meditated
i
do
see
why
i
should
get
rid
of
him
if
he
dares
me
the
scoundrel
he
simply
asking
for
it
and
he
shall
have
it
oh
but
i
would
for
worlds
have
him
turned
into
the
street
with
his
wife
and
babies
my
dear
lady
i
sha
turn
them
into
the
street
i
should
be
allowed
to
there
a
cottage
at
lower
wyck
they
can
go
into
the
one
he
had
when
he
first
came
to
me
he
wondered
why
he
had
thought
of
it
before
it
was
as
it
stood
a
decent
cottage
but
if
he
was
prepared
to
spend
fifty
pounds
or
so
on
it
it
could
be
made
habitable
and
by
george
he
prepared
if
it
was
only
to
teach
ballinger
a
lesson
for
it
meant
that
ballinger
would
have
to
walk
an
extra
mile
up
hill
to
his
work
every
day
serve
him
right
the
impudent
rascal
poor
thing
he
wo
said
levitt
have
his
nice
garden
he
wo
ballinger
must
learn
said
waddington
with
magisterial
severity
that
he
ca
have
everything
he
certainly
ca
have
it
both
ways
abuse
and
threaten
me
and
expect
favours
he
may
go
to
colonel
grainger
if
it
really
happen
said
levitt
do
you
mean
that
i
may
have
the
house
i
shall
be
only
too
delighted
to
have
such
a
charming
tenant
well
i
sha
threaten
and
abuse
you
and
call
you
every
nasty
name
under
the
sun
and
you
wo
you
turn
me
out
when
my
lease
is
up
he
bowed
over
the
hand
she
held
out
to
him
you
shall
never
be
turned
out
as
long
as
you
want
to
stay
by
twelve
they
had
arranged
the
details
waddington
was
to
put
in
a
bathroom
to
throw
the
two
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
into
one
to
build
out
a
new
with
a
bedroom
over
it
and
to
paint
and
distemper
the
place
in
cream
white
throughout
and
it
was
to
be
called
the
white
house
by
the
time
they
had
finished
with
it
cottage
had
become
the
house
levitt
had
dreamed
of
all
her
life
and
not
unlike
the
house
waddington
had
dreamed
of
that
minute
while
he
planned
the
bathroom
the
little
bijou
house
where
an
adorable
but
not
too
rigorously
moral
lady
he
stopped
with
a
mental
jerk
ashamed
he
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
elise
was
or
would
become
such
a
lady
and
the
poor
innocent
woman
was
saying
just
one
thing
waddington
the
rent
no
earthly
reason
we
can
talk
about
that
another
time
i
sha
be
hard
on
you
no
he
would
be
hard
on
her
but
in
that
other
case
there
have
been
any
rent
at
all
as
he
left
the
house
he
could
see
rickards
hurrying
towards
it
across
the
square
she
waddles
like
a
duck
he
thought
the
movement
suggested
a
plebeian
excitement
and
curiosity
that
displeased
him
he
recalled
her
face
her
extraordinary
face
quite
enough
he
thought
to
put
all
that
into
my
head
poor
elise
he
liked
to
think
of
her
it
made
him
feel
what
he
had
felt
last
night
over
barbara
madden
virtuous
as
though
he
had
struggled
and
got
the
better
of
an
impetuous
passion
he
was
so
touched
by
his
own
beautiful
renunciation
that
when
he
found
fanny
working
in
the
garden
he
felt
a
sudden
tenderness
for
her
as
the
cause
of
it
she
looked
up
at
him
from
her
pansy
bed
and
laughed
what
are
you
looking
so
sentimental
for
old
thing
levitt
affair
settled
he
could
now
give
his
whole
time
to
the
serious
business
of
the
day
he
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
get
it
over
nothing
could
be
more
disturbing
than
fanny
suggestion
that
the
name
of
sir
john
corbett
might
carry
more
weight
with
his
committee
than
his
own
the
waddingtons
of
wyck
had
ancestry
waddingtons
had
held
lower
wyck
manor
for
ten
generations
whereas
sir
john
corbett
father
had
bought
underwoods
and
rebuilt
it
somewhere
in
the
on
the
other
hand
sir
john
was
the
largest
and
richest
landowner
in
the
place
he
could
buy
up
wyck
on
the
hill
to
morrow
and
thrive
on
the
transaction
he
therefore
represented
the
larger
vested
interest
and
as
the
whole
object
of
the
league
was
the
safeguarding
of
vested
interests
in
other
words
of
liberty
that
british
liberty
which
is
bound
up
with
law
and
order
with
private
property
in
general
and
landownership
in
particular
as
the
principle
of
its
very
being
was
the
preservation
of
precisely
such
an
institution
as
sir
john
himself
the
committee
of
the
wyck
branch
of
the
league
could
hardly
avoid
inviting
him
to
be
its
president
there
was
no
blinking
the
fact
and
fanny
had
blinked
it
that
sir
john
was
the
proper
person
most
of
fanny
suggestions
had
a
strong
but
unpleasant
element
of
common
sense
but
the
more
interest
he
took
in
the
league
the
more
passionately
he
flung
himself
into
the
business
of
its
creation
the
more
abhorrent
to
waddington
was
the
thought
that
the
chief
place
in
it
the
presidency
would
pass
over
his
head
to
sir
john
his
only
hope
was
in
sir
john
indolence
and
irresponsibility
sir
john
was
the
exhausted
reaction
from
the
efforts
of
a
grandfather
and
of
a
father
spendthrift
in
energy
he
had
had
everything
done
for
him
ever
since
he
was
a
baby
and
consequently
was
now
unable
or
unwilling
to
do
anything
for
himself
or
other
people
you
could
see
him
taking
an
active
part
in
the
management
of
the
league
and
waddington
could
see
himself
doing
all
the
work
and
handing
over
all
the
glory
to
sir
john
still
between
waddington
and
the
glory
there
was
only
this
supine
figure
of
sir
john
and
sir
john
once
out
of
the
running
he
could
count
without
immodesty
on
the
unanimous
vote
of
any
committee
he
formed
in
wyck
it
was
possible
that
even
a
sir
john
corbett
would
not
really
carry
it
over
a
waddington
of
wyck
but
waddington
was
taking
any
risks
what
he
had
to
do
was
to
suggest
the
presidency
to
sir
john
in
such
a
way
that
he
would
be
certain
to
refuse
it
he
had
the
good
luck
to
find
sir
john
alone
in
his
library
at
eating
hot
buttered
toast
there
was
hope
for
waddington
in
sir
john
attitude
lying
back
and
nursing
his
little
round
stomach
hope
in
the
hot
buttery
gleam
of
his
cheeks
in
his
wide
mouth
lazy
under
the
jutting
grey
moustache
and
in
the
scrabbling
of
his
little
legs
as
he
exerted
himself
to
stand
upright
well
waddington
glad
to
see
you
he
was
in
his
chair
again
with
another
prodigious
effort
he
leaned
forward
and
rang
for
more
tea
and
more
toast
did
you
walk
said
sir
john
his
little
round
eyes
expressed
horror
at
the
possibility
no
i
just
ran
over
in
my
car
drove
yourself
no
too
much
effort
of
attention
i
find
it
interferes
with
my
thinking
interferes
with
everything
said
sir
john
you
drove
enough
during
the
war
to
last
you
for
the
rest
of
your
life
ah
government
service
a
very
different
thing
that
reminds
me
come
to
consult
you
on
a
matter
of
public
business
business
he
noted
sir
john
uneasy
pout
better
have
some
tea
first
sir
john
took
another
piece
of
buttered
toast
if
only
sir
john
would
go
on
eating
nothing
like
buttered
toast
for
sustaining
that
mood
of
voluptuous
inertia
when
waddington
judged
the
moment
propitious
he
began
while
i
was
up
in
london
i
had
the
pleasure
of
lunching
with
sir
maurice
gedge
he
wants
me
to
start
a
branch
of
the
national
league
of
liberty
here
liberty
should
have
thought
that
was
much
in
your
line
expect
to
see
you
waving
the
red
flag
what
why
did
you
put
him
on
to
our
friend
grainger
my
dear
corbett
what
are
you
thinking
of
the
object
of
the
league
is
to
put
down
all
that
sort
of
thing
socialism
bolshevism
to
rouse
the
whole
country
and
get
it
to
stand
solid
for
order
and
good
government
h
is
it
queer
sort
of
title
for
a
thing
of
that
sort
league
of
liberty
what
waddington
raised
a
clenched
fist
already
in
spirit
he
was
on
his
platform
exactly
the
title
that
needed
the
people
want
liberty
always
have
wanted
it
we
let
have
it
true
liberty
british
liberty
i
tell
you
corbett
we
out
against
the
tyranny
of
labour
minorities
you
and
i
and
every
man
that
got
any
standing
and
any
influence
we
got
to
see
to
it
that
we
do
have
a
revolution
and
communism
and
a
soviet
government
here
come
you
do
think
the
bolshies
are
as
strong
as
all
that
do
you
waddington
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
i
they
are
he
said
and
look
here
if
they
get
the
upper
hand
it
the
great
capitalists
the
great
property
holders
the
great
like
you
and
me
corbett
who
be
the
first
to
suffer
why
suffering
as
it
is
here
in
wyck
with
just
the
little
that
fellow
grainger
can
do
the
time
come
mark
my
words
when
we
sha
be
able
to
get
a
single
labourer
to
work
for
us
for
a
fair
wage
they
bleed
us
white
corbett
before
they
done
with
us
if
we
do
make
a
stand
and
make
it
now
that
what
the
league
for
to
set
up
a
standard
something
we
can
point
to
and
say
these
are
the
principles
we
stand
for
something
you
can
rally
the
whole
country
round
we
shall
want
your
support
i
shall
be
very
glad
anything
i
can
do
waddington
was
a
little
disturbed
by
this
ready
acquiescence
mind
you
it
is
going
to
end
here
in
wyck
i
shall
start
it
in
wyck
first
then
i
shall
take
it
straight
to
the
big
towns
gloucester
cheltenham
cirencester
nailsworth
stroud
we
set
going
till
we
got
a
branch
in
every
town
and
every
village
in
the
county
he
thought
that
ought
to
settle
him
he
had
created
a
vision
of
intolerable
activity
bless
me
said
sir
john
you
got
your
work
cut
out
for
you
of
course
i
shall
have
to
get
a
local
committee
first
i
ca
take
a
step
like
that
without
consulting
you
sir
john
muttered
something
that
sounded
like
very
good
of
you
sure
no
more
than
my
duty
to
the
league
now
the
point
is
sir
maurice
was
anxious
that
should
be
president
of
this
local
branch
it
needs
somebody
with
energy
and
determination
the
president
work
certainly
will
be
cut
out
for
him
and
i
feel
very
strongly
and
i
think
that
my
committee
will
feel
that
corbett
are
the
proper
person
h
i
did
think
i
should
be
justified
in
going
further
without
first
obtaining
your
consent
waddington
anxiety
was
almost
unbearable
the
programme
had
evidently
appealed
to
sir
john
supposing
after
all
he
accepted
i
would
ask
you
to
undertake
anything
so
so
arduous
but
that
strengthen
my
hands
with
my
committee
in
fact
i
may
get
a
much
stronger
and
more
influential
committee
if
i
can
come
to
them
and
tell
them
beforehand
that
you
have
consented
to
be
president
i
do
mind
being
president
said
sir
john
if
i
have
got
to
do
anything
i
afraid
i
we
could
allow
you
to
be
a
mere
figurehead
but
presidents
always
are
figureheads
are
they
there
was
a
bantering
gleam
in
sir
john
eyes
that
irritated
waddington
that
was
the
worst
of
corbett
you
could
get
him
to
take
a
serious
thing
seriously
any
rate
sir
john
went
on
there
always
some
secretary
johnnie
who
runs
round
and
does
the
work
so
that
was
corbett
idea
to
sit
in
his
armchair
and
bag
all
the
prestige
while
he
waddington
of
wyck
ran
round
and
did
the
work
not
in
this
case
in
these
small
local
affairs
you
ca
delegate
business
everything
depends
on
the
personal
activity
of
the
president
the
deuce
it
does
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
this
if
sir
john
corbett
asks
for
a
subscription
he
gets
it
we
got
to
round
up
the
whole
county
and
all
the
townspeople
and
villagers
it
no
use
shooting
pamphlets
at
from
a
they
like
being
personally
interviewed
if
sir
john
corbett
comes
and
talk
to
them
and
tells
them
they
must
join
ten
to
one
they
will
join
and
there
is
any
time
to
be
lost
if
we
want
to
get
in
first
before
other
places
take
it

good
but
i
could
at
least
propose
you
as
president
you
could
very
well
propose
yourself
it
very
good
of
you
waddington
made
his
voice
sound
casual
and
indifferent
so
that
he
might
appear
to
be
entertaining
the
suggestion
provisionally
and
under
protest
there
have
to
be
one
big
meeting
before
the
formed
or
anything
if
i
let
you
off
the
presidency
he
said
playfully
will
you
take
the
chair
for
that
one
evening
that
one
evening
only
you
do
all
the
talking
i
shall
have
to
all
right
my
dear
fellow
i
daresay
i
can
get
my
wife
to
come
on
your
committee
too
that
help
you
to
rope
in
the
townspeople
and
now
supposing
we
drop
it
and
have
a
quiet
smoke
he
roused
himself
to
one
more
effort
of
course
we
send
you
a
subscription
both
of
us
waddington
drove
off
from
underwoods
in
a
state
of
pleasurable
elation
he
had
got
what
he
wanted
without
appearing
without
appearing
at
all
to
be
playing
for
it
corbett
had
never
spotted
him
there
he
was
wrong
at
that
very
moment
sir
john
was
relating
the
incident
to
lady
corbett
and
you
could
see
all
the
time
the
fellow
wanted
it
himself
i
put
him
in
an
awful
funk
pretending
i
was
going
to
take
it
all
the
same
he
admitted
very
handsomely
that
the
idea
of
the
league
was
topping
and
that
waddington
was
the
man
for
it
and
the
subscription
that
he
and
lady
corbett
sent
was
very
handsome
too
unfortunately
it
obliged
waddington
to
contribute
a
slightly
larger
sum
by
way
of
maintaining
his
ascendancy
on
his
way
home
he
called
at
the
old
dower
house
in
the
square
to
see
his
mother
he
had
arranged
to
meet
fanny
and
barbara
madden
there
and
drive
them
home
the
old
lady
was
sitting
in
her
chair
handsome
with
dark
eyes
still
brilliant
in
her
white
roman
face
a
small
imperious
face
yet
soft
soft
in
its
network
of
fine
grooves
and
pittings
an
exquisite
old
lady
in
a
black
satin
gown
and
white
embroidered
shawl
with
a
white
chantilly
scarf
binding
rolled
masses
of
white
hair
she
had
been
a
miss
postlethwaite
of
medlicott
my
dear
boy
so
you
got
back
she
turned
to
her
son
with
a
soft
moan
of
joy
lifting
up
her
hands
to
hold
his
face
as
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
how
well
you
look
she
said
is
that
london
or
coming
back
to
fanny
it
coming
back
to
you
ah
she
has
spoilt
you
you
know
how
to
say
nice
things
to
your
old
mother
she
looked
up
at
him
at
his
solemn
face
that
simmered
with
excited
egoism
barbara
could
see
that
he
was
playing
playing
in
his
ponderous
fatuous
way
at
being
her
young
her
not
more
than
years
old
son
he
turned
with
a
sudden
sportive
caracoling
movement
to
find
a
chair
for
himself
he
was
sitting
on
it
now
close
beside
his
mother
and
she
was
holding
one
of
his
big
fleshy
hands
in
her
fragile
bird
claws
and
patting
it
from
her
study
of
the
ancestral
portraits
in
the
manor
barbara
gathered
that
he
owed
to
his
mother
the
handsome
roman
structure
that
held
up
his
face
after
all
so
proudly
through
its
layers
of
waddington
flesh
he
had
the
postlethwaite
nose
the
old
lady
looked
at
her
gratified
by
the
grave
attention
of
her
eyes
miss
madden
ca
believe
that
a
little
woman
like
me
could
have
such
a
great
big
son
she
said
but
you
see
he
is
big
to
me
he
never
be
any
older
than
thirteen
you
could
see
it
if
he
was
really
thirteen
to
her
he
was
a
day
older
than
he
was
her
young
son
whose
caresses
flattered
her
she
spoils
me
miss
madden
you
could
see
that
it
pleased
him
to
sit
close
to
her
knees
to
have
his
hand
patted
and
be
spoilt
nonsense
now
tell
me
what
happened
at
underwoods
is
it
to
be
john
corbett
or
you
corbett
says
it
to
be
me
i
glad
he
had
that
much
sense
well
and
now
tell
me
all
about
this
league
of
yours
he
told
her
all
about
it
and
she
sat
very
quietly
listening
nodding
her
proud
old
head
in
approval
he
talked
about
it
till
it
was
time
to
go
then
the
old
lady
became
agitated
my
dear
boy
you
must
let
kimber
drive
you
too
fast
down
that
hill
fanny
will
you
tell
kimber
to
be
careful
her
face
trembled
with
anxiety
as
she
held
it
to
him
to
be
kissed
at
that
moment
he
was
her
child
escaping
from
her
going
out
rashly
into
the
dangerous
world
i
like
going
to
see
granny
said
fanny
as
kimber
tucked
them
up
together
in
the
car
she
makes
me
feel
young
you
may
very
well
feel
it
said
waddington
it
only
my
white
hair
miss
madden
that
makes
her
look
old
i
thought
said
barbara
she
looked
ever
so
much
younger
she
was
going
to
say
than
she
is
than
most
people
mothers
you
will
have
noticed
fanny
said
that
my
husband
is
younger
than
most
people
barbara
noticed
that
he
had
drawn
himself
up
with
an
offended
air
unnaturally
straight
he
did
like
it
this
discussion
about
ages
they
were
running
out
of
the
square
when
fanny
remembered
and
cried
out
oh
stop
him
horatio
we
must
go
back
and
see
if
ralph
coming
to
dinner
but
at
the
white
hart
they
were
told
that
bevan
had
gone
to
oxford
on
his
and
was
not
expected
to
return
before
ten
sorry
barbara
i
do
see
why
you
should
apologize
to
miss
madden
my
dear
i
no
doubt
she
can
get
on
very
well
without
him
she
may
want
something
rather
more
exciting
than
you
and
me
sometimes
i
quite
happy
barbara
said
of
course
you
happy
it
is
everybody
who
enjoys
ralph
society
i
daresay
you
like
me
you
find
him
a
great
hindrance
to
serious
conversation
that
why
enjoy
him
fanny
said
we
ask
him
for
night
barbara
tucked
her
chin
into
the
collar
of
her
coat
the
car
was
running
down
sheep
street
into
lower
wyck
she
stared
out
abstractedly
at
the
eastern
valley
the
delicate
green
cornfields
and
pink
fallows
the
muffling
of
dim
trees
all
washed
in
the
pale
eastern
blue
rolling
out
and
up
to
the
blue
ridge
it
made
her
happy
to
look
at
it
it
made
her
happy
to
think
of
ralph
bevan
coming
if
it
had
been
it
would
have
been
all
over
in
three
hours
and
something
she
was
not
sure
what
but
felt
that
it
might
be
waddington
something
would
have
cut
in
to
spoil
the
happiness
of
it
but
now
she
had
it
to
think
about
and
her
thoughts
were
safe
what
are
you
thinking
about
barbara
the
view
said
barbara
i
want
to
sketch
it
v
waddington
was
in
his
library
drawing
up
his
prospectus
while
fanny
and
barbara
madden
looked
on
at
fanny
suggestion
he
owned
magnanimously
that
it
was
a
good
one
he
had
decided
to
sail
in
as
she
called
it
with
the
prospectus
first
not
only
before
he
formed
his
committee
but
before
he
held
his
big
meeting
they
had
fixed
the
date
of
it
for
that
day
month
saturday
june
the
you
come
before
them
from
the
beginning
she
said
with
something
fixed
and
definite
that
they
ca
go
back
on
and
by
signing
the
prospectus
horatio
bysshe
waddington
he
identified
it
beyond
all
contention
with
himself
it
was
at
this
point
that
barbara
had
blundered
why
she
had
said
should
we
go
to
all
that
bother
and
expense
why
ca
we
send
out
the
original
prospectus
my
dear
barbara
the
original
prospectus
is
any
good
why
is
it
because
it
is
horatio
prospectus
barbara
looked
down
and
away
from
the
dangerous
light
in
fanny
eyes
but
it
expresses
his
views
does
it
that
no
good
when
he
wants
to
express
them
himself
and
so
far
from
being
any
good
the
original
prospectus
was
a
positive
hindrance
to
waddington
it
took
all
the
wind
out
of
his
sails
it
took
as
he
justly
complained
the
very
words
out
of
his
mouth
and
the
ideas
out
of
his
head
it
got
in
his
way
and
upset
him
at
every
turn
somehow
or
other
he
had
got
to
stamp
his
personality
upon
this
thing
it
no
good
he
said
if
they
ca
recognize
it
as
a
personal
appeal
from
me
and
here
it
was
stamped
all
over
and
indelibly
with
the
personalities
of
sir
maurice
gedge
and
his
london
committee
and
he
could
depart
radically
from
the
lines
they
had
laid
down
there
were
just
so
many
things
to
be
said
and
sir
maurice
and
his
committee
had
contrived
to
say
them
all
but
though
the
matter
was
given
him
waddington
before
he
actually
tackled
his
prospectus
had
conceived
himself
as
supplying
his
own
fresh
and
inimitable
manner
the
happy
touch
the
sudden
arresting
turn
but
somehow
it
was
working
out
that
way
try
as
he
would
he
get
away
from
the
turns
and
touches
supplied
by
sir
maurice
gedge
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
he
said
to
draw
up
the
original
prospectus
i
a
thousand
times
rather
do
that
than
write
one
on
the
top
of
it
fanny
agreed
it
got
to
different
she
said
without
different
could
we
said
barbara
turn
it
upside
down
upside
down
he
stared
at
her
with
great
owl
eyes
offended
suspecting
her
this
time
of
an
outrageous
levity
yes
really
upside
down
you
see
the
heads
go
in
this
order
defence
of
private
property
defence
of
capital
defence
of
liberty
defence
of
government
defence
of
the
empire
danger
of
revolution
communism
and
bolshevism
every
man
duty
why
not
reverse
them
every
man
duty
danger
of
bolshevism
communism
and
revolution
defence
of
the
empire
defence
of
government
defence
of
liberty
defence
of
capital
defence
of
private
property
that
an
idea
said
fanny
not
at
all
a
bad
idea
said
waddington
you
might
take
down
the
heads
in
that
order
barbara
took
them
down
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
presented
a
very
original
appearance
thus
reversed
and
as
barbara
pointed
out
the
one
order
was
every
bit
as
logical
as
the
other
and
though
waddington
objected
that
he
would
have
preferred
to
close
on
the
note
of
government
and
empire
he
was
open
to
the
suggestion
that
while
this
might
appeal
more
to
the
county
with
the
farmers
and
townspeople
capital
and
private
property
would
strike
further
home
and
by
the
time
he
had
changed
combat
the
forces
of
disorder
to
take
a
stand
against
anarchy
and
disruption
and
spirit
of
freedom
in
this
country
to
british
genius
for
liberty
and
darkest
hour
in
england
history
to
blackest
period
in
the
history
of
england
he
was
persuaded
that
the
prospectus
was
now
entirely
and
absolutely
his
own
but
i
think
we
must
sound
the
note
of
hope
to
end
up
with
my
own
message
how
about
must
remember
that
the
darkest
hour
comes
before
dawn
my
dear
horatio
if
you
inflate
yourself
so
over
your
prospectus
you
have
no
wind
left
when
you
come
to
speak
be
as
wildly
original
as
you
please
but
be
wasteful
and
extravagant
all
right
fanny
i
will
reserve
the
dawn
please
make
a
note
of
that
miss
madden
speech
or
did
i
say
before
dawn
you
better
reserve
all
you
can
said
fanny
when
barbara
had
typed
the
prospectus
waddington
insisted
on
taking
it
to
pyecraft
himself
he
wanted
to
insure
its
being
printed
without
delay
and
to
arrange
for
the
posters
and
handbills
he
also
wanted
to
see
the
impression
it
would
make
on
pyecraft
and
on
the
young
lady
in
pyecraft
shop
he
liked
to
think
of
the
stir
in
the
composing
room
when
it
was
handed
in
and
of
the
importance
he
was
conferring
on
pyecraft
you
have
said
what
you
think
of
the
prospectus
said
fanny
as
they
watched
him
go
i
have
said
what
i
think
of
the
league
of
liberty
what
you
think
of
it
i
think
it
looks
as
if
somebody
was
in
an
awful
funk
and
i
do
see
that
there
going
to
be
much
liberty
about
it
that
said
fanny
is
how
it
struck
me
but
it
keep
horatio
quiet
for
the
next
six
months
and
afterwards
oh
afterwards
there
be
his
book
i
forgotten
his
book
that
keep
him
quieter
than
anything
else
if
you
can
get
him
to
settle
down
to
it
that
evening
barbara
witnessed
the
reconciliation
of
waddington
and
ralph
bevan
waddington
made
a
spectacle
of
it
standing
majestic
and
immovable
by
his
hearth
and
holding
out
his
hand
long
before
ralph
had
got
near
enough
to
take
it
good
evening
ralph
glad
to
see
you
here
again
good
of
you
to
ask
me
sir
barbara
thought
he
winced
a
little
at
the
sir
he
had
a
distaste
for
those
forms
of
deference
which
implied
his
seniority
you
could
see
he
did
like
ralph
his
voice
was
genial
but
there
was
no
light
in
his
bulging
stare
the
heavy
lines
of
his
face
never
lifted
she
wondered
was
it
ralph
brilliant
youth
that
had
offended
him
reminding
him
even
when
he
refused
to
recognize
his
fascination
for
you
could
see
that
he
did
refuse
that
he
regarded
ralph
bevan
as
an
inferior
insignificant
personality
barbara
had
to
revise
her
theory
he
jealous
of
him
it
would
never
occur
to
him
that
fanny
or
barbara
for
that
matter
could
find
ralph
interesting
nothing
could
disturb
for
a
moment
his
immense
satisfaction
with
himself
he
conducted
dinner
with
a
superb
detachment
confining
his
attention
to
fanny
and
barbara
as
if
he
were
pretending
that
ralph
was
there
until
suddenly
he
heard
fanny
asking
him
if
he
knew
anything
about
the
national
league
of
liberty
and
what
he
thought
of
it
waddington
does
want
to
know
what
i
think
of
it
no
but
we
want
to
my
dear
fanny
any
opinion
any
honest
opinion
oh
ralph
opinion
will
be
honest
enough
honest
i
daresay
said
waddington
well
if
you
really
want
to
know
i
think
it
a
pathological
symptom
a
what
said
waddington
startled
into
a
show
of
interest
pathological
symptom
it
all
funk
blue
funk
true
blue
funk
that
what
barbara
says
the
young
man
looked
at
barbara
as
much
as
to
say
i
knew
i
could
trust
you
to
take
the
only
intelligent
view
it
run
he
said
by
a
few
imbeciles
like
sir
maurice
gedge
they
scared
out
of
their
lives
of
bolshevism
do
you
mean
to
say
that
bolshevism
is
dangerous
not
in
this
country
perhaps
then
you
like
to
see
a
soviet
government
in
this
country
i
did
say
so
but
i
understand
that
you
uphold
bolshevism
i
do
uphold
funk
but
said
ralph
there
rather
more
in
it
than
that
it
being
engineered
it
a
deliberate
dishonest
and
malicious
attempt
to
discredit
labour
absurd
said
waddington
you
show
that
you
are
ignorant
of
the
very
principles
of
the
league
if
he
recognized
ralph
youth
it
was
only
to
despise
it
as
crude
and
uninformed
it
is
the
national
league
of
liberty
well
that
about
all
the
liberty
there
is
in
it
liberty
to
suppress
liberty
you
may
not
know
that
i
starting
a
branch
of
the
league
in
wyck
i
sorry
sir
i
did
not
know
fanny
why
did
you
lay
that
trap
for
me
because
i
wanted
your
real
opinion
before
you
set
up
an
opinion
you
had
better
come
to
my
meeting
on
the
then
perhaps
you
learn
something
about
it
fanny
changed
the
subject
to
sir
john
corbett
laziness
a
man
said
waddington
without
any
seriousness
any
sense
of
responsibility
after
coffee
waddington
removed
fanny
to
the
library
to
consult
with
him
about
the
formation
of
his
committee
leaving
barbara
and
ralph
bevan
alone
fanny
waved
her
hand
to
them
from
the
doorway
signalling
her
blessing
on
their
unrestrained
communion
it
deplorable
said
ralph
to
see
a
woman
of
fanny
intelligence
mixing
herself
up
with
a
rotten
scheme
like
that
poor
darling
she
only
does
it
to
keep
him
quiet
oh
yes
i
admit
there
every
excuse
for
her
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
a
smile
of
delicious
and
secret
understanding
is
he
wonderful
she
said
i
thought
you
like
him
i
say
you
know
i
come
to
his
meeting
he
be
more
wonderful
than
ever
there
ca
you
see
him
i
can
it
almost
much
to
think
that
i
should
be
allowed
to
know
him
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
to
have
him
turning
himself
on
by
the
hour
together
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
it
i
see
he
said
you
got
it
got
what
the
taste
for
him
the
genuine
passion
i
had
it
when
i
was
here
i
could
have
stood
it
if
i
had
i
know
you
must
have
had
it
you
got
it
now
and
i
do
suppose
i
seen
him
anything
like
at
his
best
you
get
more
out
of
him
than
i
did
oh
do
you
think
i
shall
yes
he
may
rise
to
greater
heights
you
mean
he
may
go
to
greater
lengths
perhaps
i
do
know
you
have
of
course
to
stop
his
lengths
which
would
he
a
pity
i
think
of
him
mostly
in
heights
there
no
reason
why
you
should
let
him
soar
but
i
must
discuss
him
i
just
eaten
his
dinner
no
we
must
barbara
agreed
that
the
worst
of
dinners
i
say
though
ca
we
meet
somewhere
where
we
yes
where
we
can
let
ourselves
rip
could
we
go
for
more
walks
together
i
afraid
there
wo
be
time
there
be
loads
of
time
when
he
off
in
his
car
up
the
county
when
he
i
as
waddington
companion
fanny
wo
mind
she
let
you
do
anything
you
like
at
any
rate
she
let
do
anything
like
will
you
ask
her
of
course
i
shall
so
they
settled
it
when
barbara
said
to
herself
that
waddington
would
spoil
her
evening
with
ralph
bevan
she
had
judged
by
the
change
that
had
come
over
the
house
since
the
return
of
its
master
you
felt
it
first
in
the
depressed
faces
of
the
servants
of
partridge
and
annie
trinder
a
thoughtful
gloom
had
settled
even
on
kimber
worse
than
all
fanny
waddington
had
left
off
humming
barbara
missed
that
spontaneous
expression
of
her
happiness
she
thought
what
is
it
he
does
to
them
and
yet
it
was
clear
that
he
did
do
anything
they
were
simply
crushed
by
the
sheer
mass
and
weight
of
his
egoism
he
imposed
on
them
somehow
his
incredible
consciousness
of
himself
he
left
an
atmosphere
of
uneasiness
you
felt
it
when
he
was
there
even
when
fanny
had
settled
down
in
the
with
you
felt
her
fear
that
at
any
minute
the
door
would
open
and
horatio
would
come
in
but
barbara
was
depressed
she
enjoyed
the
perpetual
spectacle
he
made
she
enjoyed
his
very
indifference
to
ralph
his
refusal
to
see
that
he
could
command
attention
his
conviction
of
his
own
superior
fascination
she
knew
now
what
ralph
meant
when
he
said
it
would
be
unkind
to
spoil
him
for
her
he
was
to
burst
on
her
without
preparation
or
description
she
was
to
discover
him
first
of
all
herself
first
of
all
but
she
could
see
the
time
coming
when
her
chief
joy
would
be
their
making
him
out
bit
by
bit
together
she
even
discerned
a
merry
devil
in
fanny
that
amused
itself
at
horatio
expense
that
was
aware
of
barbara
amusement
and
condoned
it
there
were
ultimate
decencies
that
prevented
any
open
communion
with
fanny
but
beyond
that
refusal
to
smile
at
horatio
after
eating
his
dinner
she
could
see
no
decencies
restraining
ralph
she
could
count
on
him
when
her
private
delight
became
intolerable
and
must
be
shared
but
there
were
obstacles
to
their
intercourse
waddington
very
well
start
on
what
he
called
his
campaign
until
he
was
armed
with
his
prospectus
and
pyecraft
took
more
than
a
week
to
print
it
and
while
she
sat
idle
thinking
of
her
salary
the
fiend
of
conscience
prompted
barbara
to
ask
him
for
work
was
there
his
book
my
book
my
cotswold
book
he
pretended
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
he
waved
it
away
the
book
is
only
a
recreation
an
amusement
plenty
of
time
for
that
when
i
got
my
league
going
still
i
shall
be
glad
when
i
can
settle
down
to
it
he
was
considering
it
now
with
reminiscent
affection
if
it
would
amuse
you
to
look
at
it
he
began
a
fussy
search
in
his
bureau
ah
here
we
are
he
unearthed
two
piles
of
manuscript
one
typed
the
other
written
both
scored
with
erasures
with
almost
illegible
corrections
and
insertions
it
in
a
terrible
mess
he
said
she
saw
what
her
work
would
be
to
cut
a
way
through
the
jungle
to
make
clearings
if
i
were
to
type
it
all
over
again
you
have
a
clean
copy
to
work
on
when
you
were
ready
if
you
be
so
good
it
that
young
rascal
ralph
he
no
business
to
leave
it
in
that
state
her
scruple
came
again
to
barbara
waddington
you
take
him
on
again
for
your
secretary
if
he
come
back
he
come
back
all
right
trust
him
and
you
take
him
my
dear
young
lady
why
should
i
i
do
want
i
want
and
do
want
to
stand
in
his
way
you
need
worry
about
that
i
ca
help
worrying
about
it
you
take
him
back
if
i
was
here
you
here
but
if
i
were
come
come
you
must
talk
to
me
like
that
she
went
away
and
talked
to
fanny
i
ca
bear
doing
him
out
of
his
job
if
he
come
back
my
dear
you
do
know
ralph
he
die
rather
than
come
back
made
it
impossible
between
them
waddington
says
he
take
him
back
if
i
was
here
he
would
he
only
thinks
he
would
because
it
makes
him
feel
magnanimous
he
offered
ralph
half
a
year
salary
if
he
go
at
once
and
ralph
went
at
once
and
would
touch
the
salary
that
made
him
come
out
top
dog
and
horatio
did
like
it
not
that
he
supposed
he
could
score
off
ralph
with
money
he
is
vulgar
no
he
was
vulgar
but
she
wondered
how
he
would
camouflage
it
to
himself
that
insult
to
his
pride
and
there
was
ralph
pride
that
was
so
fiery
and
so
clean
yet
yet
bevan
comes
and
dines
she
said
yes
he
comes
and
dines
he
always
be
my
cousin
though
he
wo
be
horatio
secretary
he
got
a
very
sweet
nature
and
he
keeps
the
issues
clear
but
what
will
he
he
ca
live
on
his
sweet
nature
oh
he
got
enough
to
live
on
though
not
enough
to
to
do
what
he
wants
on
but
he
get
a
job
all
right
you
need
bother
your
dear
little
head
about
ralph
fanny
said
to
herself
i
tell
him
then
he
adore
her
more
than
ever
if
only
he
adores
her
he
buck
up
and
get
something
to
do
vi
waddington
did
not
approve
of
levitt
intimacy
with
her
sister
bertha
rickards
he
would
have
approved
of
it
still
less
if
he
had
heard
the
conversation
which
trinder
heard
and
reported
to
miss
gregg
the
governess
at
the
rectory
who
told
the
rector
wife
who
told
the
rector
who
told
colonel
grainger
who
told
ralph
sevan
who
kept
it
to
himself
what
did
you
say
to
the
old
boy
elise
do
ask
me
what
i
well
have
you
got
the
cottage
of
course
i
got
it
silly
cuckoo
i
can
get
anything
out
of
him
i
like
he
was
going
to
turn
those
ballingers
out
but
i
made
him
did
he
say
when
waddington
was
going
to
call
bertha
could
resist
the
temptation
of
pinching
where
she
knew
the
flesh
was
tender
i
did
ask
him
she
ca
very
well
be
off
it
now
he
your
landlord
that
was
what
levitt
thought
and
if
waddington
called
lady
corbett
could
very
well
be
off
it
either
they
were
the
only
ones
in
wyck
who
had
not
called
but
it
would
be
futile
to
pretend
that
they
did
matter
that
they
were
not
the
ones
who
mattered
more
than
anybody
the
net
she
had
drawn
round
waddington
was
tightening
though
he
was
as
yet
unaware
of
his
entanglement
first
of
all
the
lower
wyck
cottage
was
put
into
thorough
repair
and
if
the
plaster
was
not
quite
dry
when
the
ballingers
moved
into
it
that
was
not
waddington
concern
he
had
provided
them
with
a
house
which
was
all
that
the
law
could
reasonably
require
him
to
do
clearly
it
was
hitchin
the
builder
who
should
be
held
responsible
for
the
plaster
not
he
as
for
the
rheumatism
ballinger
got
supposing
it
could
be
put
down
to
the
damp
plaster
and
not
to
some
inherent
defect
in
constitution
clearly
that
was
not
waddington
concern
either
if
anybody
was
responsible
for
ballinger
rheumatism
it
was
hitchin
waddington
did
not
approve
of
hitchin
hitchin
was
a
socialist
who
followed
colonel
grainger
lead
in
overpaying
his
workmen
with
disastrous
consequences
to
other
people
for
over
and
above
the
general
upsetting
caused
by
this
gratuitous
interference
with
the
prevailing
economic
system
hitchin
was
in
the
habit
of
recouping
himself
by
monstrous
overcharges
and
hitchin
was
not
only
the
best
builder
in
the
neighbourhood
but
the
only
builder
and
stonemason
in
so
that
he
had
you
practically
at
his
mercy
and
operations
at
the
sheep
street
cottage
were
suspended
while
waddington
disputed
hitchin
estimate
bit
by
bit
from
the
total
cost
of
building
the
new
rooms
down
to
the
last
pot
of
enamel
paint
and
his
charge
per
foot
for
lead
piping
june
was
slipping
away
while
they
contended
and
there
seemed
little
chance
of
levitt
getting
into
her
house
before
michaelmas
if
then
so
that
on
the
morning
of
the
nineteenth
two
days
before
the
meeting
waddington
found
another
letter
waiting
for
him
on
the
fanny
was
looking
at
him
and
he
sought
protection
in
an
affectation
of
annoyance
now
what
can
levitt
find
to
write
to
me
about
i
would
set
any
limits
to
her
invention
fanny
said
and
what
do
you
know
about
mrs
levitt
nothing
i
only
gather
from
what
you
say
yourself
that
she
is
fertile
in
resource
resource
well
in
creating
opportunities
opportunities
now
for
what
for
you
to
exercise
your
christian
charity
my
dear
when
are
you
going
to
let
me
call
on
her
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
call
on
her
at
all
is
that
christian
charity
it
anything
you
please
he
was
absorbed
in
his
letter
levitt
had
been
obliged
to
move
from
trinder
in
the
square
to
inferior
rooms
in
sheep
street
and
she
was
sorry
for
herself
but
surely
when
you
always
calling
on
her
yourself
i
am
not
always
calling
on
her
and
if
i
were
there
are
some
things
which
are
perfectly
proper
for
me
to
do
which
would
not
be
proper
for
you
it
sounds
as
if
levitt
was
he
looked
up
as
sharply
as
his
facial
curves
permitted
nothing
of
the
sort
she
simply
not
the
sort
of
person
you
call
on
and
i
mean
you
to
begin
why
not
because
you
my
wife
and
you
have
a
certain
position
in
the
county
that
why
rather
a
snobby
reason
is
it
you
said
i
might
call
on
anybody
i
liked
so
you
may
in
reason
provided
you
do
begin
with
mrs
levitt
i
may
have
to
end
with
her
said
fanny
waddington
had
many
reasons
for
not
wishing
fanny
to
call
on
levitt
he
wanted
to
keep
his
wife
because
she
was
his
wife
in
a
place
apart
from
levitt
and
above
her
to
mark
the
distance
and
distinction
that
there
was
between
them
he
wanted
to
keep
himself
as
fanny
husband
apart
and
distant
by
way
of
enhancing
his
male
attraction
and
he
wanted
to
keep
levitt
apart
to
keep
her
to
himself
as
the
hidden
woman
of
passionate
adventure
hitherto
their
intercourse
had
had
the
charm
the
unique
irreplaceable
charm
of
things
unacknowledged
and
clandestine
levitt
was
unique
irreplaceable
he
could
think
of
any
other
woman
who
would
be
a
suitable
substitute
there
was
little
barbara
madden
she
had
been
afraid
of
him
but
his
passions
were
still
too
young
to
be
stirred
by
the
crudity
of
a
fright
if
it
came
to
that
he
preferred
the
reassuring
ease
of
levitt
and
he
did
mean
it
to
come
to
that
but
though
waddington
did
not
actually
look
forward
to
a
time
when
he
would
be
levitt
lover
he
had
visions
of
the
pure
fancy
in
which
he
saw
himself
standing
on
levitt
doorstep
after
dark
say
once
a
fortnight
on
her
servant
night
out
he
would
sound
a
muffled
signal
on
the
knocker
and
the
door
would
he
by
elise
elise
he
would
slip
through
in
a
slender
and
mysterious
manner
he
would
go
on
up
and
down
her
stairs
recapturing
a
youthful
thrill
out
of
the
very
risks
they
ran
yet
managing
the
affair
with
a
consummate
delicacy
and
discretion
at
this
point
waddington
fancy
heard
another
door
open
down
the
street
somebody
came
out
and
saw
him
in
the
light
of
the
passage
somebody
went
by
with
a
lantern
somebody
timed
his
comings
and
goings
he
felt
the
palpitation
the
cold
nausea
of
detection
no
you
do
these
things
in
a
little
place
like
where
everybody
knew
everybody
else
business
and
there
was
toby
too
sometimes
perhaps
on
a
sunday
afternoon
when
toby
and
the
servant
would
be
out
yes
sunday
afternoon
between
and
or
he
could
meet
her
in
oxford
or
cheltenham
or
in
london
wiser
more
satisfactory
risk
of
being
seen
there
too
but
you
must
take
some
risks
surprising
how
these
things
kept
secret
birmingham
now
birmingham
would
be
safer
because
more
unlikely
he
did
know
anybody
in
birmingham
but
the
very
thought
of
levitt
calling
at
the
manor
on
the
same
commonplace
footing
say
as
grainger
was
destruction
to
all
this
romantic
secrecy
also
he
was
afraid
that
if
levitt
were
really
that
sort
of
woman
fanny
admirable
instinct
would
find
her
out
and
scent
the
imminent
affair
or
if
fanny
remained
unsuspicious
and
showed
plainly
her
sense
of
security
elise
might
become
possessive
and
from
sheer
jealousy
give
herself
away
waddington
said
to
himself
that
he
knew
women
and
that
if
he
were
a
wise
man
and
he
a
wise
man
he
would
arrange
matters
so
that
the
two
should
never
meet
fanny
was
docile
and
if
he
said
flatly
that
she
was
not
to
call
on
levitt
she
would
there
was
another
thing
that
waddington
dreaded
even
more
than
that
dangerous
encounter
fanny
knowing
that
he
had
turned
the
ballingers
out
as
he
would
have
been
very
unwilling
to
admit
that
levitt
had
forced
his
hand
there
he
took
the
whole
of
the
responsibility
for
that
action
but
inevitable
and
justifiable
as
it
was
he
could
hope
to
carry
it
off
triumphantly
with
fanny
it
was
just
but
it
was
not
magnanimous
therefore
without
making
any
positively
untruthful
statement
he
had
let
her
think
that
ballinger
had
given
notice
of
his
own
accord
the
chances
he
thought
were
all
against
fanny
ever
hearing
the
truth
of
the
matter
if
only
the
rascal
had
had
a
wife
and
children
and
if
only
his
wife
but
unfortunately
for
waddington
his
wife
was
susan
trinder
trinder
husband
niece
and
susan
trinder
had
been
nurse
and
though
they
all
considered
that
she
had
done
for
herself
when
she
married
that
ballinger
fanny
and
horace
still
called
her
and
niece
annie
trinder
was
parlourmaid
at
the
manor
so
waddington
had
a
nasty
qualm
when
annie
clearing
away
breakfast
asked
if
she
might
have
a
day
off
to
look
after
her
aunt
ballinger
who
was
in
bed
with
the
rheumatics
to
his
horror
he
heard
fanny
saying
she
would
have
had
the
rheumatics
if
they
stayed
in
sheep
street
no
annie
eyes
were
clear
and
mendacious
he
never
ought
to
have
left
it
said
fanny
no
no
more
he
ought
is
she
very
sorry
about
it
why
could
fanny
leave
it
alone
yes
m
she
frettin
something
awful
you
see
so
much
the
house
though
a
better
one
than
the
one
they
in
the
garden
all
that
fruit
and
vegetable
what
uncle
he
put
in
himself
and
them
lavender
bushes
aunt
she
so
fond
of
a
bit
of
lavender
i
dunnow
i
sure
how
she
get
along
annie
knew
he
could
tell
by
her
eyes
that
she
knew
there
was
nothing
but
annie
loyalty
between
him
and
that
exposure
that
he
dreaded
he
heard
fanny
say
that
she
would
go
and
see
susan
there
would
be
nothing
but
susan
loyalty
and
ballinger
magnanimity
it
would
amount
to
that
if
they
spared
him
for
fanny
sake
he
had
been
absolutely
right
and
ballinger
had
brought
the
whole
trouble
on
himself
but
you
could
never
make
fanny
see
that
and
ballinger
contrived
to
put
him
still
further
in
the
wrong
the
next
day
when
fanny
called
at
the
cottage
she
found
it
empty
ballinger
had
removed
himself
and
his
wife
and
family
to
susan
father
farm
at
medlicott
a
good
two
and
a
half
miles
from
his
work
on
colonel
grainger
land
thus
providing
himself
with
a
genuine
grievance
and
fanny
would
keep
on
talking
about
it
at
dinner
those
poor
ballingers
it
an
awful
pity
he
gave
up
the
sheep
street
cottage
did
you
tell
him
he
was
a
fool
horatio
mercifully
annie
trinder
had
left
the
room
but
there
was
partridge
by
the
sideboard
listening
i
not
responsible
for
ballinger
folly
if
he
finds
himself
inconvenienced
by
it
that
no
concern
of
mine
well
ballinger
folly
has
been
very
convenient
for
mrs
levitt
waddington
tried
to
look
as
if
levitt
convenience
were
no
concern
of
his
either
vii
the
handbills
and
posters
had
been
out
for
the
last
week
their
headlines
were
very
delightful
to
the
eye
with
their
enormous
capitals
staring
at
you
in
pyecraft
royal
blue
print
national
league
of
liberty
a
meeting
in
aid
of
the
above
league
will
be
held
in
the
town
hall
june
sir
john
corbett
of
underwoods
horatio
bysshe
waddington
of
the
manor
house
lower
wyck
you
are
earnestly
requested
to
attend
god
save
the
king
only
one
thing
threatened
waddington
intense
enjoyment
of
his
meeting
his
son
horace
would
be
there
young
horace
had
insisted
on
coming
over
from
cheltenham
college
for
the
night
expressly
to
attend
the
meeting
and
though
waddington
had
pointed
out
that
the
meeting
could
very
well
take
place
without
him
fanny
appeared
to
be
backing
young
horace
up
in
his
impudent
opinion
that
it
could
this
he
found
excessively
annoying
for
though
for
worlds
he
would
have
owned
it
waddington
was
afraid
of
his
son
he
was
never
the
same
man
when
he
was
about
the
presence
of
young
horace
tall
for
sixteen
and
developing
rapidly
was
fatal
to
the
illusion
of
his
youth
and
horace
had
a
way
of
commenting
disadvantageously
on
everything
his
father
said
or
did
he
had
a
perfect
genius
for
humorous
depreciation
at
any
rate
he
and
his
mother
behaved
as
if
they
thought
it
was
humorous
and
many
of
his
remarks
seemed
to
strike
other
people
sir
john
and
lady
corbett
for
example
and
ralph
bevan
in
the
same
light
over
and
over
again
young
horace
would
keep
the
whole
table
listening
to
him
with
unreasoning
and
unreasonable
delight
while
his
father
efforts
to
converse
received
only
a
polite
and
perfunctory
attention
and
the
prospect
of
having
young
horace
humour
let
loose
on
his
meeting
and
on
his
speech
at
the
meeting
was
distinctly
disagreeable
fanny
ought
to
have
allowed
it
to
happen
he
ought
to
have
allowed
it
himself
but
short
of
writing
to
his
head
master
to
forbid
it
they
could
stop
young
horace
coming
he
had
only
to
get
on
his
and
come
barbara
came
on
him
in
the
before
dinner
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
and
giggling
over
the
prospectus
he
jumped
up
and
stood
by
the
hearth
smiling
at
her
i
say
did
my
really
write
this
himself
more
or
less
did
you
really
come
over
for
the
meeting
rather
his
smile
was
wilful
and
engaging
you
enthusiastic
about
the
league
enthusiastic
i
ca
say
i
know
much
about
it
of
course
i
know
the
sort
of
putrid
tosh
he
sling
at
them
but
what
i
want
is
to
him
doing
it
he
had
got
it
too
that
passion
of
interest
and
amusement
hers
and
ralph
only
it
was
decent
of
him
to
show
it
she
must
let
him
see
she
had
it
she
answered
soberly
yes
he
awfully
keen
he
i
never
seen
him
really
excited
worked
up
except
once
or
twice
during
the
war
as
he
stood
there
looking
down
smiling
pensively
he
seemed
to
brood
over
it
to
anticipate
the
joy
of
the
spectacle
he
had
an
impudent
happy
face
turned
and
coloured
like
his
mother
he
had
fanny
blue
eyes
and
brown
hair
all
that
the
waddingtons
and
postlethwaites
had
done
to
him
was
to
raise
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
to
thicken
his
lips
slightly
without
altering
their
wide
vivacious
twirl
he
considered
barbara
you
going
to
help
him
to
write
his
book
are
you
i
hope
so
said
barbara
you
got
a
nerve
he
pretty
well
did
for
ralph
bevan
he
worse
than
when
he
once
gets
going
i
expect
i
can
stand
him
he
ca
be
worse
than
the
war
office
oh
is
he
you
wait
at
that
moment
his
father
came
in
late
and
betraying
the
first
symptoms
of
excitement
barbara
saw
that
the
boy
eyes
took
them
in
as
they
sat
down
to
dinner
waddington
pretended
to
ignore
horace
but
horace
would
be
ignored
he
drew
attention
instantly
to
himself
do
you
think
it
jolly
decent
of
me
pater
to
come
over
for
your
meeting
i
should
have
thought
said
waddington
that
politics
were
much
in
your
line
not
worth
spoiling
a
for
i
do
suppose
i
shall
care
two
fags
about
your
old
league
what
come
for
is
to
see
you
pater
getting
up
on
your
hind
legs
and
giving
it
them
i
would
miss
that
for
a
million
if
that
all
you
come
for
you
might
have
saved
yourself
the
trouble
trouble
my
dear
father
i
have
taken
trouble
you
could
see
he
was
laughing
at
him
and
he
was
talking
at
barbara
attracting
her
attention
the
whole
time
with
every
phrase
he
shot
a
look
at
her
across
the
table
evidently
he
was
afraid
she
might
think
he
did
know
how
funny
his
father
was
and
he
had
to
show
her
it
decent
of
him
barbara
did
approve
of
young
horace
yet
she
resist
him
his
eyes
and
mouth
were
full
like
ralph
of
such
intelligent
yet
irresponsible
joy
he
wanted
her
to
share
it
he
was
an
egoist
like
his
father
but
he
had
something
of
his
mother
charm
something
of
ralph
bevan
nothing
he
was
saying
nothing
would
have
kept
me
away
you
very
good
sir
horace
could
appreciate
that
biting
sarcasm
not
at
all
i
say
i
wish
you
let
me
come
on
the
platform
what
for
you
do
propose
yourself
as
a
speaker
do
you
rather
not
i
simply
want
to
be
somewhere
where
i
can
see
your
face
and
old
grainger
at
the
same
time
and
hitchin
when
you
going
for
their
socialism
you
shall
certainly
not
come
on
the
platform
and
wherever
you
sit
i
must
request
you
to
behave
yourself
if
you
can
you
may
not
realize
it
but
this
is
going
to
be
a
serious
meeting
i
know
it
just
the
the
seriousness
that
gets
me
he
giggled
waddington
shrugged
his
shoulders
of
course
if
you
no
sense
of
responsibility
if
you
choose
to
go
on
like
an
schoolboy
but
do
be
surprised
if
you
reprimanded
from
the
chair
what
old
corbett
i
should
like
to
see
him
do
you
worry
pater
i
behave
a
jolly
sight
better
than
anybody
else
will
you
see
if
i
do
how
did
you
suppose
he
behave
horatio
said
fanny
when
he
come
all
that
way
and
given
up
a
picnic
to
hear
you
pater
be
a
picnic
if
you
like
said
horace
waddington
waved
him
away
with
a
gesture
as
if
he
flicked
a
teasing
fly
and
went
out
to
collect
his
papers
fanny
turned
to
her
son
horry
dear
you
must
rag
your
father
like
that
you
must
laugh
at
him
he
does
like
it
i
ca
help
it
horry
said
he
so
furiously
funny
he
me
giggle
well
whatever
you
do
do
giggle
at
the
meeting
or
you
give
him
away
i
wo
mater
honour
bright
i
wo
i
hold
myself
in
like
like
anything
only
you
must
mind
if
i
burst
waddington
had
spoken
for
half
an
hour
expounding
with
some
necessary
repetitions
the
principles
and
objects
of
the
league
he
was
supported
on
the
platform
by
his
chairman
sir
john
corbett
and
by
the
other
members
of
his
projected
committee
by
lady
corbett
by
fanny
by
the
rector
by
thurston
of
the
elms
by
bostock
of
parson
bank
jackson
of
jackson
cleaver
and
solicitors
major
markham
of
wyck
wold
temple
of
and
hawtrey
of
medlicott
and
by
his
secretary
miss
barbara
madden
the
body
of
the
hall
was
packed
beneath
him
in
the
front
row
he
had
the
wives
and
daughters
of
his
committeemen
in
its
centre
right
under
his
nose
he
was
painfully
aware
of
the
presence
of
young
horace
and
ralph
bevan
colonel
grainger
sat
behind
them
conspicuous
and
waddington
fancied
a
little
truculent
with
his
great
square
face
and
red
moustache
and
on
each
side
of
colonel
grainger
and
behind
him
were
the
neighbouring
gentry
and
the
townspeople
of
wyck
the
two
grocers
the
two
butchers
the
drapers
and
hotel
keeper
and
behind
them
again
the
servants
of
the
manor
and
a
crowd
of
shop
assistants
and
further
and
further
back
farm
labourers
and
artisans
among
these
he
recognized
ballinger
with
several
of
colonel
grainger
and
hitchin
men
a
pretty
compact
group
they
made
and
waddington
was
gratified
by
their
appearance
there
and
well
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
above
the
women
hats
he
could
see
hitchin
bush
of
hair
his
shrewd
round
and
rosy
face
his
grey
check
shoulders
and
red
tie
hitchin
had
the
air
of
being
supported
by
the
entire
body
of
his
workmen
waddington
was
gratified
by
hitchin
appearance
too
and
he
thought
he
would
insert
some
expression
of
that
feeling
in
his
peroration
he
was
also
profoundly
aware
of
levitt
sitting
all
by
herself
in
an
empty
space
about
the
middle
of
the
third
row
from
time
to
time
ralph
bevan
and
young
horace
fixed
on
fanny
waddington
and
barbara
delighted
eyes
in
faces
of
a
supernatural
gravity
young
horace
was
looking
odd
and
unlike
himself
with
his
jaws
clamped
together
in
his
prodigious
effort
not
to
giggle
whenever
barbara
eyes
met
his
and
ralph
a
faint
smile
quivered
on
her
face
and
flickered
and
went
out
once
horace
whispered
to
ralph
bevan
is
he
going
it
and
ralph
whispered
back
he
immense
he
was
he
felt
immense
he
felt
that
he
was
carrying
his
audience
with
him
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
excited
him
and
whipped
him
on
it
was
a
sort
of
intoxication
he
was
soaring
now
up
and
up
into
his
peroration
it
is
a
gratification
to
me
to
see
so
many
working
men
and
women
here
they
are
specially
welcome
we
want
to
have
them
with
us
do
not
distrust
the
working
man
the
working
man
is
sound
at
heart
sound
at
head
too
when
he
is
let
alone
and
not
carried
away
by
the
treacherous
arguments
of
ignorant
agitators
we
myself
and
the
founders
of
this
league
have
not
that
bad
opinion
of
the
working
man
which
his
leaders
his
misleaders
i
may
call
them
appear
to
have
we
believe
in
him
we
know
that
if
he
were
only
let
alone
there
is
no
section
of
the
community
that
would
stand
more
solid
for
order
and
good
government
than
he
hear
hear
from
colonel
grainger
ralph
whispered
camouflage
to
horace
who
nodded
there
is
nothing
in
the
aims
of
this
league
contrary
to
the
interests
of
labour
on
the
contrary
he
heard
as
if
somebody
else
had
perpetrated
it
the
horrible
repetition
i
mean
to
say
his
brain
fought
for
another
phrase
madly
and
in
vain
on
the
contrary
it
exists
in
order
to
safeguard
the
true
interests
the
best
interests
of
every
working
man
and
woman
in
the
country
hear
hear
from
sir
john
corbett
waddington
smiled
president
wilson
he
became
agitated
and
drank
water
president
wilson
talked
about
making
the
world
safe
for
democracy
well
if
we
you
and
i
all
of
us
do
take
care
the
world
wo
be
safe
for
anything
else
it
certainly
wo
be
safe
for
the
middle
classes
for
the
great
business
and
professional
classes
for
the
class
to
which
i
for
one
belong
the
class
of
english
gentlemen
it
wo
be
safe
for
not
that
i
propose
to
make
a
class
question
of
it
to
make
a
class
question
of
it
would
be
more
than
wrong
it
would
be
foolish
it
would
be
a
challenge
to
revolution
the
first
step
towards
letting
loose
unchaining
against
us
those
forces
of
disorder
and
destruction
which
we
are
seeking
to
keep
down
i
am
not
here
to
insist
on
class
differences
to
foment
class
hatred
those
differences
exist
they
always
will
exist
but
they
are
immaterial
to
our
big
purpose
this
is
a
question
of
principle
the
great
principle
of
british
liberty
are
we
going
to
submit
to
the
tyranny
of
one
class
over
all
other
classes
of
one
interest
over
all
other
interests
in
the
country
are
we
going
to
knock
under
i
say
to
a
minority
whether
it
is
a
labour
minority
or
any
other
are
we
going
to
tolerate
bolshevism
and
a
soviet
government
here
if
there
are
any
persons
present
who
think
that
that
is
our
attitude
and
our
intention
i
tell
them
now
plainly
it
is
in
their
own
language
in
our
good
old
county
proverb
sure
as
god
in
gloucester
it
is
not
and
never
will
be
the
sooner
they
understand
that
the
better
i
do
not
say
that
there
are
any
persons
present
who
would
be
guilty
of
so
gross
an
error
i
do
not
believe
there
are
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
intelligent
person
in
this
room
who
will
not
agree
with
me
when
i
say
that
though
it
is
just
and
right
that
labour
should
have
a
voice
in
the
government
it
is
not
just
and
it
is
not
right
that
it
should
be
the
only
voice
it
has
been
the
only
voice
heard
in
russia
for
two
years
and
what
is
the
consequence
bloodshed
anarchy
and
bloodshed
i
do
that
we
should
have
anarchy
and
bloodshed
here
england
thank
god
is
not
russia
but
i
do
not
say
that
we
shall
have
them
and
i
say
that
it
rests
with
us
with
you
and
me
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
decide
whether
we
shall
or
shall
not
have
them
it
depends
on
the
action
we
take
with
regard
to
this
national
league
of
liberty
on
the
action
taken
on
on
other
nights
at
similar
meetings
all
over
this
england
of
ours
it
depends
in
two
words
on
our
whether
we
shall
have
anarchy
or
stable
government
whether
this
england
of
ours
shall
or
shall
not
continue
to
be
a
free
country
remember
two
things
the
league
is
national
and
it
is
a
league
of
liberty
it
would
not
be
one
if
it
were
not
the
other
you
will
say
perhaps
many
of
you
saying
league
is
all
very
well
but
what
can
do
perhaps
you
will
even
say
can
wyck
do
after
all
wyck
is
a
small
place
it
is
the
capital
of
the
county
well
i
can
tell
you
what
wyck
can
do
it
can
be
it
the
first
town
in
gloucestershire
the
first
provincial
town
in
england
to
start
a
national
league
of
liberty
they
got
a
league
in
london
the
parent
league
they
may
have
another
branch
league
anywhere
any
day
but
i
hope
that
thanks
to
the
very
noble
efforts
of
those
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
have
kindly
consented
to
serve
on
my
committee
i
hope
that
before
long
we
shall
have
started
leagues
in
gloucester
cheltenham
cirencester
nailsworth
and
stroud
in
every
town
village
and
hamlet
in
the
county
i
hope
thanks
to
your
decision
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
be
able
to
say
that
wyck
little
wyck
has
got
in
first
all
round
us
for
fifteen
twenty
miles
round
there
are
hamlets
villages
and
towns
that
have
got
a
league
that
know
nothing
about
the
league
will
be
the
centre
of
the
league
for
this
part
of
the
cotswolds
it
is
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
the
principle
at
stake
impossible
therefore
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
this
league
therefore
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
this
meeting
of
every
man
and
woman
who
has
come
here
and
when
you
rise
from
your
seats
and
step
up
to
this
platform
to
enroll
your
names
as
members
of
the
national
league
of
liberty
i
want
you
to
feel
every
one
of
you
that
you
will
be
doing
an
important
thing
a
thing
necessary
to
the
nation
a
thing
in
its
way
every
bit
as
necessary
and
important
as
the
thing
the
soldier
does
when
he
rises
up
out
of
his
trench
and
goes
over
the
top
it
was
then
and
then
only
that
young
horace
giggled
but
he
covered
his
collapse
with
a
shout
of
hear
hear
that
caused
fanny
and
barbara
to
blow
their
noses
simultaneously
as
for
ralph
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
like
him
said
waddington
you
will
be
helping
to
save
england
and
what
can
any
of
us
do
more
he
sat
down
suddenly
in
a
perfect
uproar
of
applause
and
drank
water
in
spite
of
the
applause
he
was
haunted
by
a
sense
of
incompleteness
there
was
something
he
had
left
out
of
his
speech
something
he
had
particularly
wanted
to
say
it
seemed
to
him
more
vital
more
important
than
anything
he
said
a
solitary
pair
of
hands
levitt
hands
conspicuously
lifted
were
still
clapping
when
hitchin
face
rose
like
a
red
moon
behind
and
a
little
to
the
left
of
her
followed
by
the
grey
check
shoulders
and
red
tie
he
threw
back
his
head
stuck
a
thumb
in
each
armhole
of
his
waistcoat
and
spoke
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
speaker
has
quoted
president
wilson
about
the
world
being
made
safe
for
democracy
he
seems
to
be
concerned
about
the
future
to
be
if
i
may
say
so
in
a
bit
of
a
funk
about
the
future
but
has
he
paid
any
attention
to
the
past
has
he
considered
the
position
of
the
working
man
in
the
past
has
he
even
considered
the
condition
of
many
working
men
at
the
present
time
for
instance
of
the
farm
labourer
now
in
this
country
if
he
had
if
he
knew
the
facts
if
he
cared
about
the
facts
he
might
admit
that
whether
he
going
to
like
it
or
not
it
the
working
man
turn
just
about
his
turn
i
need
ask
waddington
if
he
knows
the
parable
of
dives
and
lazarus
but
i
should
like
to
say
to
him
what
abraham
said
to
the
rich
man
that
thou
in
thy
receivedst
thy
good
things
and
likewise
lazarus
evil
things
but
now
he
is
comforted
and
thou
art
tormented
i
do
want
waddington
to
be
tormented
to
be
tormented
too
much
not
more
than
is
reasonable
a
little
torment
say
his
finger
scorched
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
in
that
hot
unpleasant
place
would
be
good
for
him
if
it
made
him
think
i
say
i
do
want
to
torment
him
but
i
just
ask
him
one
question
does
he
think
that
a
world
where
it
possible
for
a
working
man
just
because
he
a
working
man
and
not
an
english
gentleman
a
world
where
it
still
possible
for
him
and
his
wife
and
his
children
to
be
turned
out
of
house
and
home
to
suit
the
whim
of
an
english
gentleman
does
he
think
that
a
world
where
things
like
that
can
happen
is
a
safe
place
for
anybody
i
can
tell
him
it
is
safe
it
is
safe
for
you
and
me
and
if
it
is
safe
for
you
and
me
it
is
safe
for
the
people
who
make
these
things
happen
and
it
is
any
safer
for
the
people
who
stand
by
and
let
them
happen
and
if
the
socialist
if
the
bolshevist
is
the
man
who
going
to
see
to
it
that
they
do
happen
if
a
soviet
government
is
the
only
government
that
see
to
that
then
the
socialist
or
the
bolshevist
is
the
man
for
my
money
and
a
soviet
government
is
the
government
for
my
vote
i
do
say
mind
you
that
it
the
only
government
i
say
if
it
were
waddington
does
like
bolshevism
none
of
us
like
it
he
like
socialism
i
think
he
got
some
wrong
ideas
about
that
but
dead
right
when
he
tells
you
if
you
afraid
of
bolshevism
and
a
soviet
government
that
the
remedy
lies
in
your
own
hands
if
there
ever
is
a
day
of
reckoning
what
waddington
would
call
a
revolution
in
this
country
you
we
ay
everyone
of
us
sitting
here
will
be
done
with
according
as
we
do
he
sat
down
and
waddington
rose
again
on
his
platform
solemn
and
a
little
pale
he
looked
round
the
hall
to
show
that
there
was
no
person
there
whom
he
was
afraid
to
face
it
might
have
been
the
look
of
some
bold
and
successful
statesman
turning
on
a
turbulent
house
confident
in
his
power
to
hold
it
unless
i
have
misheard
him
what
hitchin
has
just
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
sounded
very
like
a
threat
if
that
is
so
we
may
congratulate
hitchin
on
providing
an
unanswerable
proof
of
the
need
for
a
national
league
of
liberty
there
were
cries
of
hear
hear
from
sir
john
corbett
and
from
hawtrey
of
medlicott
then
a
horrible
thing
happened
slight
and
rustling
at
first
then
gathering
volume
there
came
a
hissing
from
the
back
rows
packed
with
colonel
grainger
and
hitchin
men
then
a
booing
then
a
booing
and
hissing
together
sir
john
scrabbled
on
to
his
little
legs
and
cried
ordah
there
ordah
waddington
maintained
an
indomitably
supercilious
air
while
sir
john
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
probably
the
most
energetic
thing
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
with
a
loud
shout
of
ordah
colonel
grainger
and
hitchin
were
seen
to
turn
round
in
their
places
and
make
a
sign
to
their
men
and
the
demonstration
ceased
waddington
then
rose
as
if
nothing
at
all
had
happened
and
said
any
ladies
and
gentlemen
wishing
to
join
the
league
will
please
come
up
to
the
platform
and
give
their
names
to
miss
madden
any
persons
wishing
to
subscribe
at
once
may
pay
their
subscriptions
to
miss
madden
i
will
now
call
your
attention
to
the
last
item
on
the
programme
and
ask
you
all
to
join
with
me
very
heartily
in
singing
save
the
king
everybody
except
colonel
grainger
and
hitchin
rose
and
everybody
except
the
extremists
of
the
opposition
sang
one
voice
it
was
levitt
voice
was
lifted
arrogantly
high
and
clear
above
the
rest
send
him
and
glorious
long
overious
save
ther
king
waddington
waited
beside
barbara
madden
at
the
table
he
waited
in
a
superb
confidence
after
all
the
demonstration
engineered
by
colonel
grainger
had
had
no
effect
the
front
and
middle
rows
had
risen
to
their
feet
and
a
very
considerable
procession
was
beginning
to
file
towards
the
platform
waddington
was
so
intent
on
this
procession
barbara
was
so
busy
taking
down
names
and
entering
subscriptions
and
making
out
receipts
sir
john
and
lady
corbett
and
the
rest
of
the
proposed
committee
were
talking
to
each
other
so
loud
and
fast
ralph
and
horace
were
so
absorbed
in
looking
at
barbara
that
none
of
them
saw
what
was
happening
in
the
body
of
the
hall
only
fanny
caught
the
signals
that
passed
between
colonel
grainger
and
hitchin
and
between
hitchin
and
his
men
then
colonel
grainger
stood
up
and
shouted
i
protest
hitchin
stood
up
and
shouted
i
protest
they
shouted
together
we
protest
sir
john
corbett
rushed
back
to
his
chair
and
shouted
ordah
and
the
back
rows
the
ranks
of
hitchin
men
stood
up
and
shouted
we
sign
we
wo
sign
we
wo
sign
and
then
young
horace
did
an
unsuspected
thing
a
thing
that
surprised
himself
he
leaped
on
to
the
front
bench
and
faced
the
insurgent
back
rows
his
face
was
red
with
excitement
and
with
the
shame
and
anger
and
resentment
inspired
by
his
father
eloquence
but
he
was
shouting
in
his
hoarse
breaking
adolescent
voice
look
here
you
blackguards
there
at
the
back
if
you
do
stop
that
row
this
minute
i
jolly
well
chuck
you
all
out
only
one
voice
the
voice
of
hitchin
biggest
and
brawniest
quarryman
replied
come
on
sir
young
horace
vaulted
lightly
over
the
bench
followed
by
ralph
and
the
two
were
steeplechasing
down
the
hall
when
hitchin
made
another
of
his
mysterious
signals
and
the
men
filed
out
obediently
one
by
one
ralph
and
horace
found
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
empty
benches
laughing
into
each
other
faces
colonel
grainger
and
hitchin
stood
beside
them
smiling
with
intolerable
benevolence
hitchin
was
saying
the
men
are
all
right
bevan
they
mean
any
harm
they
just
got
a
bit
out
of
hand
horace
saw
that
they
were
being
magnanimous
and
the
thought
maddened
him
i
do
blame
the
men
he
said
and
i
do
blame
you
hitchin
you
do
know
any
better
but
colonel
grainger
ought
to
be
damned
well
ashamed
of
himself
and
i
hope
he
is
colonel
grainger
laughed
so
did
hitchin
throwing
himself
back
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
as
his
mirth
shook
him
look
here
hitchin
that
do
horry
said
ralph
he
led
him
gently
down
a
side
aisle
and
through
a
swing
door
into
the
concealed
corridor
beside
the
platform
there
they
waited
do
imagine
for
one
moment
said
young
horry
that
i
agree
with
all
that
tosh
he
talked
but
after
all
he
got
a
perfect
right
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
if
he
chooses
and
he
father
i
know
from
first
to
last
horry
you
behaved
beautifully
well
what
would
do
if
your
father
made
an
unholy
ass
of
himself
in
public
my
father
does
no
but
if
he
did
i
do
what
you
did
sit
tight
and
try
and
look
as
if
he
did
then
said
horace
you
look
as
big
a
fool
yourself
not
quite
you
do
say
anything
besides
your
father
is
as
big
a
fool
as
those
london
leaguers
who
started
the
silly
show
sir
maurice
gedge
and
all
that
crowd
he
did
invent
the
beastly
thing
no
said
horace
mournfully
he
has
even
the
merit
of
originality
he
meditated
still
mournful
look
here
ralph
what
did
that
blackguard
hitchin
mean
he
is
a
blackguard
he
a
ripping
good
sort
i
can
tell
you
if
every
employer
in
this
confounded
commercial
country
was
as
honest
as
old
hitchin
there
would
be
any
labour
question
worth
talking
about
damn
his
honesty
what
did
he
was
it
true
what
he
said
was
what
true
why
that
my
father
turned
the
ballingers
out
yes
i
afraid
it
was
i
say
how
disgusting
of
him
you
know
i
always
thought
he
was
a
bit
of
a
fool
my
father
but
i
did
know
he
was
that
beastly
kind
of
fool
he
is
said
ralph
he
just
a
fool
i
know
did
you
ever
hear
such
putrid
rot
as
he
talked
i
do
know
for
the
kind
of
silly
thing
it
was
his
speech
half
bad
what
about
going
over
the
top
oh
lord
and
after
turning
the
ballingers
out
too
ralph
was
silent
what
happened
to
him
he
did
use
to
be
like
that
he
must
be
mad
or
something
ralph
thought
of
levitt
he
getting
old
and
he
does
like
it
that
what
the
matter
with
him
but
hang
it
all
ralph
that
no
excuse
it
really
is
i
believe
ballinger
gave
him
some
provocation
i
do
care
what
he
gave
him
he
no
earthly
business
to
take
advantage
of
it
not
with
that
sort
of
person
besides
it
matter
about
ballinger
so
much
but
there
old
susan
and
the
kiddies
he
does
see
how
perfectly
sickening
it
is
for
it
is
very
nice
for
your
mother
no
it
jolly
hard
on
the
poor
mater
well
i
ca
stick
it
much
longer
i
just
about
fed
up
with
horatio
bysshe
i
shall
clear
out
first
thing
in
the
morning
before
he
down
i
do
care
if
i
never
see
him
or
speak
to
him
again
i
say
i
say
how
about
the
midsummer
holidays
oh
damn
the
midsummer
holidays
is
it
rather
rotten
to
take
a
line
you
ca
possibly
keep
up
that
all
right
whatever
i
may
do
in
the
future
said
young
horace
magnificently
i
got
to
give
him
his
punishment
ralph
laughed
young
horace
was
as
big
an
egoist
as
his
father
but
with
these
differences
his
blood
was
hot
instead
of
cold
he
had
his
mother
humour
and
he
was
not
a
fool
ralph
wondered
how
he
would
have
felt
if
he
had
realized
levitt
part
in
the
ballinger
affair
waddington
remained
standing
on
his
platform
they
were
coming
round
him
now
grasping
him
by
the
hand
congratulating
him
sir
john
corbett
the
rector
major
markham
of
wyck
wold
and
hawtrey
of
medlicott
capital
speech
waddington
capital
best
speech
made
in
the
town
hall
since
they
built
it
splendid
you
landed
them
one
every
time
no
wonder
you
drew
them
down
on
to
you
that
was
a
disgraceful
business
said
sir
john
disgraceful
nothing
of
the
sort
ever
happened
in
wyck
before
said
the
rector
nobody
ever
made
a
speech
like
waddington
before
said
major
markham
of
wyck
wold
oh
you
always
get
a
row
if
you
drag
in
politics
hawtrey
said
i
do
know
said
sir
john
that
was
a
job
between
hitchin
and
grainger
struck
me
it
had
every
appearance
of
a
spontaneous
outburst
major
markham
said
i
no
doubt
the
rowdy
element
was
brought
in
from
the
outside
said
the
rector
hardly
one
of
hitchin
workpeople
is
a
wyck
man
otherwise
i
should
have
to
apologize
to
waddington
for
my
parishioners
you
need
there
was
nothing
personal
to
me
in
it
nothing
personal
at
all
even
hitchin
would
have
had
the
impudence
to
oppose
me
on
my
own
platform
it
was
the
league
they
were
going
for
bit
too
big
for
if
you
come
out
with
a
large
important
thing
like
that
sure
to
be
some
opposition
just
at
first
till
it
gets
hold
of
glad
you
can
see
it
that
way
said
sir
john
my
dear
fellow
that
the
way
to
see
it
it
the
right
way
the
big
impersonal
way
you
taken
it
in
the
proper
spirit
waddington
said
the
rector
none
of
those
fellows
meant
any
real
harm
all
good
fellows
by
the
way
is
it
true
that
the
ballingers
have
moved
to
lower
wyck
i
believe
so
dear
me
what
on
earth
possessed
them
some
fad
of
ballinger
i
fancy
that
reminds
me
i
must
go
and
see
mrs
ballinger
you
wo
find
them
there
sir
they
moved
again
to
her
father
at
medlicott
you
do
say
so
i
wonder
now
what
they
done
that
for
they
complained
of
the
house
being
damp
for
one
thing
if
it
was
that
was
hitchin
fault
not
mine
was
everybody
in
a
plot
to
badger
him
about
those
wretched
ballingers
he
was
getting
sick
of
it
and
he
wanted
to
speak
a
word
to
levitt
levitt
had
come
up
in
the
tail
of
the
procession
she
had
given
in
her
name
and
her
subscription
to
barbara
madden
but
she
lingered
waiting
no
doubt
for
a
word
with
him
if
only
corbett
and
the
rest
of
them
would
go
of
course
of
course
it
was
hitchin
fault
said
the
rector
with
imperishable
geniality
well
good
night
waddington
and
thank
you
for
a
most
a
most
stimulating
evening
they
had
gone
now
all
but
sir
john
and
lady
corbett
he
could
hear
her
talking
to
fanny
at
the
back
of
the
platform
levitt
was
gathering
her
scarf
round
her
in
another
minute
she
would
be
gone
and
corbett
would
go
i
say
waddington
that
a
splendid
young
cub
of
yours
see
him
go
over
the
top
he
have
taken
them
all
on
licked
too
i
wonder
waddington
resented
this
diversion
of
the
stream
of
admiration
and
he
was
acutely
aware
of
levitt
standing
there
detached
but
waiting
was
i
really
all
right
corbett
he
was
satisfied
with
his
speech
if
only
he
could
remember
what
he
had
left
out
of
it
absolutely
my
dear
chap
absolutely
you
ought
to
make
that
boy
a
soldier
he
wished
that
young
horace
could
be
a
soldier
at
that
moment
stationed
in
a
remote
part
of
the
empire
without
any
likelihood
of
leave
for
the
next
five
years
he
wanted
he
wanted
intolerably
to
speak
to
levitt
to
spread
himself
voluptuously
in
her
rejuvenating
smile
sir
john
retreated
before
his
manifest
indifference
he
could
hear
him
at
the
back
of
the
platform
congratulating
fanny
levitt
advanced
towards
him
at
last
she
said
i
may
add
my
congratulations
that
speech
was
magnificent
nothing
my
dear
lady
nothing
but
a
little
necessary
plain
speaking
oh
but
you
were
wonderful
you
carried
us
off
our
feet
i
hope
he
said
we
enrolled
you
as
a
member
he
knew
they
had
of
course
i
enrolled
and
i
paid
in
my
poor
little
guinea
to
that
delightful
miss
madden
ah
that
is
good
of
you
it
was
the
amount
of
the
subscription
was
purely
a
matter
of
individual
fancy
it
the
least
i
could
do
in
such
a
splendid
cause
well
dear
levitt
we
delighted
to
have
you
with
us
delighted
there
was
a
pause
he
was
looking
down
at
her
from
the
height
of
his
six
feet
the
faint
sweet
scent
of
orris
root
rose
up
from
her
warm
skin
she
was
very
attractive
dressed
in
a
gown
of
that
dull
satiny
stuff
women
were
wearing
now
a
thin
band
of
white
net
was
stretched
across
the
top
of
her
breasts
through
it
he
could
see
the
shadowy
groove
between
her
pendant
pearl
bistre
and
paste
pointed
pointed
down
to
it
he
was
wrong
about
elise
and
jewellery
that
was
a
throat
for
pearls
and
for
diamonds
emeralds
she
would
be
all
black
and
white
and
sparkling
green
a
necklace
he
thought
would
hang
on
her
it
would
be
laid
out
exposed
on
that
white
breast
as
on
a
cushion
you
could
never
tell
what
a
woman
was
really
like
till
you
seen
her
in
a
gown
it
made
levitt
ten
times
more
alluring
he
smiled
at
her
a
tender
brooding
rather
fatuous
smile
levitt
saw
that
her
moment
had
come
it
would
be
now
or
never
she
must
risk
it
i
wish
she
said
you
introduce
me
to
your
wife
it
was
a
shock
a
horrid
blow
it
showed
plainly
that
elise
had
interests
beyond
him
that
she
was
not
like
him
all
for
the
secret
solitary
adventure
yet
perhaps
perhaps
she
had
planned
it
she
thought
it
would
be
safer
for
them
more
discreet
she
looked
up
at
him
with
the
old
irrefutable
smile
will
you
she
pleaded
well
i
not
sure
that
i
know
where
my
wife
she
was
here
a
minute
ago
talking
to
lady
corbett
he
looked
round
a
wide
screen
guarded
the
door
on
to
the
platform
he
could
see
lady
corbett
and
fanny
disappearing
behind
it
i
i
go
and
look
for
her
he
said
he
meditated
treachery
treachery
to
poor
elise
he
followed
them
through
the
door
and
down
the
steps
into
the
concealed
corridor
he
found
ralph
bevan
there
horace
had
gone
i
say
ralph
i
wish
you
take
fanny
home
she
tired
get
her
out
of
this
i
shall
be
here
quite
half
an
hour
longer
settling
up
accounts
you
might
tell
kimber
to
come
back
for
me
and
miss
madden
now
to
get
to
the
entrance
you
had
to
pass
through
the
swing
door
into
the
hall
and
down
the
side
aisle
to
the
bottom
so
that
levitt
witnessed
waddington
exit
with
ralph
bevan
waddington
waited
till
the
hall
doors
had
closed
on
them
before
he
returned
i
ca
find
my
wife
anywhere
he
said
she
was
in
the
so
i
think
she
must
have
gone
back
with
horace
levitt
would
think
that
fanny
had
disappeared
while
he
was
looking
for
her
honourably
in
the
i
saw
her
go
out
said
levitt
coldly
with
mr
bevan
i
suppose
he
taking
her
home
he
said
vaguely
his
best
policy
was
vagueness
and
now
my
dear
lady
i
wish
i
could
take
home
but
i
shall
be
detained
here
some
little
time
still
if
you
do
mind
waiting
a
minute
or
two
till
kimber
comes
back
with
the
car
he
shall
drive
you
thank
you
waddington
i
afraid
i
waited
quite
long
enough
it
is
worth
while
troubling
kimber
to
drive
me
a
hundred
yards
it
gave
her
pleasure
to
inflict
that
snub
on
waddington
in
return
for
his
manoeuvre
as
the
meeting
had
now
broken
up
and
there
be
anybody
to
witness
her
departure
in
the
waddingtons
car
levitt
calculated
that
she
could
afford
that
little
gratification
of
her
feelings
they
were
intensified
by
waddington
very
evident
distress
he
would
have
walked
home
with
her
the
hundred
yards
to
sheep
street
but
she
would
hear
of
it
she
was
perfectly
capable
of
seeing
herself
home
miss
madden
was
waiting
for
him
good
night
eleven
in
the
library
where
waddington
was
drinking
his
whisky
and
water
fanny
had
been
crying
horry
had
stalked
off
to
his
bedroom
without
saying
good
night
to
anybody
barbara
had
retired
discreetly
ralph
bevan
had
gone
and
when
fanny
thought
of
the
lavender
bags
sent
every
year
at
christmas
she
had
cried
how
could
you
it
horatio
how
you
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
you
ca
expect
me
to
take
your
sentimental
view
of
ballinger
it
is
ballinger
it
poor
and
the
babies
and
the
lavender
bags
waddington
swayed
placably
up
and
down
on
the
tips
of
his
toes
it
serves
poor
right
for
marrying
ballinger
oh
i
suppose
it
serves
right
too
though
she
clenched
her
hands
tight
tight
she
could
keep
back
that
little
spurt
of
anger
he
was
smiling
his
peculiar
voluptuous
smile
serves
you
right
for
spoiling
everybody
in
the
village
it
does
indeed
you
do
in
the
least
see
what
i
mean
said
fanny
but
after
all
she
was
glad
he
had
seen
it
he
had
seen
anything
he
had
seen
that
she
had
been
crying
it
had
never
dawned
on
him
that
she
might
care
about
or
that
the
ballingers
might
love
their
home
their
garden
and
their
lavender
bushes
he
was
like
that
he
did
see
things
and
he
did
care
he
was
back
in
his
triumph
of
the
evening
going
over
the
compliments
and
congratulations
again
and
again
best
speech
ever
made
in
the
town
hall
but
there
was
something
something
he
had
left
out
did
it
never
dawn
on
you
said
fanny
ah
he
had
it
there
he
said
i
knew
i
forgotten
something
i
never
put
in
that
bit
about
the
darkest
hour
before
dawn
fanny
mind
had
wandered
from
what
she
had
been
going
to
say
did
you
see
what
horry
did
she
said
instead
everybody
could
see
it
it
was
most
unnecessary
i
do
care
think
horatio
think
of
his
sticking
up
for
you
like
that
he
was
going
to
fight
them
the
dear
thing
all
those
great
rough
men
to
fight
them
for
he
said
he
behave
better
than
anybody
else
and
he
did
yes
yes
he
behaved
very
well
now
that
she
put
it
to
him
that
way
he
was
touched
by
horace
behaviour
he
could
always
be
touched
by
the
thought
of
anything
you
did
for
but
ralph
bevan
could
have
told
fanny
she
was
mistaken
young
horace
did
do
it
altogether
for
his
father
he
did
it
for
himself
for
an
ideal
of
conduct
an
ideal
of
honour
that
he
had
to
let
off
steam
to
make
a
sensation
in
the
town
hall
to
feel
himself
magnificent
and
brave
because
he
too
was
an
egoist
though
a
delightful
one
waddington
returned
to
his
speech
i
ca
think
what
made
me
leave
out
that
bit
about
the
dawn
oh
bother
your
old
dawn
said
fanny
i
going
to
bed
she
went
consoled
dear
horry
she
thought
i
glad
he
did
that
viii
the
ballinger
affair
did
not
end
with
the
demonstration
in
the
town
hall
it
had
unforeseen
and
consequences
the
first
of
these
appeared
in
a
letter
which
waddington
received
from
hitchin
dear
sir
my
estimate
for
decoration
and
additional
building
to
levitt
house
i
beg
to
inform
you
that
recent
circumstances
have
rendered
it
impossible
for
me
to
take
up
the
contract
i
must
therefore
request
you
to
transfer
your
esteemed
order
to
some
other
firm
faithfully
yours
thomas
hitchin
hitchin
expressed
his
attitude
even
more
clearly
to
the
foreman
of
his
works
i
not
going
to
build
bathrooms
and
boudoirs
and
bedrooms
for
that
the
word
he
chose
completed
the
alliteration
so
that
waddington
was
compelled
to
employ
a
cheltenham
builder
whose
estimate
exceeded
hitchin
estimate
by
thirty
pounds
and
hitchin
refusal
was
felt
even
by
people
who
resented
his
estimates
to
be
a
moral
protest
that
did
him
credit
it
impressed
the
popular
imagination
in
the
popular
imagination
levitt
was
now
inextricably
mixed
up
with
the
ballinger
affair
public
sympathy
was
all
with
ballinger
turned
out
of
his
house
and
forced
to
take
refuge
with
his
wife
father
at
medlicott
forced
to
trudge
two
and
a
half
miles
every
day
to
his
work
and
back
again
the
rector
and
major
markham
of
wyck
wold
meditating
on
the
ballinger
affair
as
they
walked
back
that
night
from
the
town
hall
pronounced
it
a
mystery
it
was
likely
major
markham
said
that
ballinger
of
his
own
initiative
would
leave
a
comfortable
house
in
sheep
street
for
a
damp
cottage
in
lower
wyck
was
it
likely
the
rector
said
that
waddington
would
turn
him
out
he
could
believe
that
old
waddington
would
do
anything
of
the
sort
unless
major
markham
suggested
he
been
got
at
levitt
may
have
got
at
him
he
was
a
good
sort
old
waddy
but
he
would
be
very
weak
in
the
hands
of
a
clever
unscrupulous
woman
the
rector
said
he
thought
there
was
no
harm
in
levitt
and
major
markham
replied
that
he
did
like
the
look
of
her
a
vague
scandal
rose
in
it
went
from
mouth
to
mouth
in
bar
parlours
and
back
shops
major
markham
transported
it
in
his
from
wyck
wold
to
the
halls
and
manors
of
winchway
and
chipping
kingdon
and
it
got
an
even
firmer
footing
in
the
county
than
in
wyck
with
the
consequence
that
one
old
lady
withdrew
her
subscription
to
the
league
and
that
when
waddington
started
on
his
campaign
of
rounding
up
the
county
the
county
refused
to
be
rounded
up
and
the
big
towns
gloucester
cheltenham
and
cirencester
were
singularly
apathetic
it
was
intimated
to
waddington
that
if
the
local
authorities
saw
fit
to
take
the
matter
up
no
doubt
something
would
be
done
but
the
big
towns
were
not
anxious
for
a
national
league
of
liberty
imposed
on
them
from
the
league
did
not
die
of
levitt
all
at
once
very
soon
after
the
inaugural
meeting
the
committee
sat
at
lower
wyck
manor
and
appointed
waddington
president
it
arranged
a
series
of
monthly
meetings
in
the
town
hall
at
which
waddington
would
speak
that
said
fanny
will
give
you
something
to
look
forward
to
every
month
thus
on
saturday
the
nineteenth
of
july
he
would
speak
on
the
truth
about
bolshevism
it
was
also
decided
that
the
league
could
be
made
very
useful
during
in
the
county
if
there
ever
were
any
and
waddington
prepared
in
fancy
a
great
speech
which
he
could
use
for
electioneering
purposes
on
july
the
nineteenth
seventeen
people
counting
fanny
and
barbara
came
to
the
meeting
sir
john
corbett
lady
corbett
was
unfortunately
unable
to
attend
the
rector
without
his
wife
major
markham
of
wyck
wold
bostock
of
parson
bank
kimber
and
partridge
and
annie
trinder
from
the
manor
the
landlady
of
the
white
hart
the
butcher
the
grocer
and
the
fishmonger
with
whom
waddington
dealt
three
farmers
who
approved
of
his
determination
to
keep
down
wages
and
levitt
when
he
sat
down
and
drank
water
there
was
a
feeble
clapping
led
by
levitt
sir
john
and
the
rector
on
august
the
sixteenth
the
audience
had
shrunk
to
levitt
kimber
and
partridge
the
butcher
one
of
the
three
farmers
and
a
visitor
staying
at
the
white
hart
waddington
spoke
on
what
the
league
can
do
owing
to
a
sudden
unforeseen
shortage
in
his
ideas
he
was
obliged
to
fall
back
on
his
electioneering
speech
and
show
how
useful
the
league
would
be
if
at
any
time
there
were
a
in
the
county
the
of
levitt
hands
burst
into
a
silent
space
nobody
not
even
kimber
or
partridge
was
going
to
follow
levitt
lead
you
have
to
give
it
up
fanny
said
next
time
there
wo
be
anybody
but
mrs
levitt
and
with
the
vision
before
him
of
all
those
foolish
empty
benches
and
levitt
dear
brave
woman
all
by
herself
waddington
admitted
that
he
would
have
to
give
it
up
not
that
he
owned
himself
beaten
not
that
he
gave
up
his
opinion
of
the
league
it
a
bit
too
big
for
he
said
they
ca
grasp
it
sleepy
minds
you
ca
rouse
if
they
wo
be
roused
he
emerged
from
his
defeat
with
an
unbroken
sense
of
intellectual
superiority
thus
the
league
languished
and
died
out
and
waddington
in
the
absence
of
this
field
for
personal
activity
languished
too
in
spite
of
his
intellectual
superiority
perhaps
because
of
it
he
languished
till
barbara
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
situation
had
its
advantages
at
last
he
could
go
on
with
his
book
if
you
can
only
start
him
on
it
and
keep
him
at
it
fanny
said
bless
you
for
ever
but
it
was
not
easy
either
to
start
him
or
to
keep
him
at
it
to
begin
with
as
ralph
had
warned
her
the
work
itself
through
the
was
in
an
appalling
mess
and
waddington
seemed
to
have
exhausted
his
original
impetus
in
getting
it
into
that
mess
he
had
set
out
on
his
ramblings
without
any
settled
plan
a
rambler
he
said
should
have
a
settled
plan
so
that
you
would
find
waddington
starting
from
and
arriving
at
lechford
in
the
thames
valley
turning
up
in
the
valley
of
the
windlode
or
the
speed
you
would
find
him
on
page
drinking
ale
at
the
lygon
arms
in
chipping
kingdon
and
on
page
looking
down
on
the
evesham
plain
from
the
heights
south
of
cheltenham
he
would
turn
from
this
prospect
and
without
traversing
any
intermediate
ground
be
back
again
where
you
least
expected
him
in
his
manor
under
for
though
he
had
no
fixed
plan
he
had
a
fixed
idea
and
however
far
he
rambled
he
returned
invariably
to
wyck
to
waddington
was
the
one
stable
the
one
certain
spot
on
the
earth
surface
and
this
led
to
his
treating
the
map
of
gloucestershire
entirely
with
reference
to
so
that
all
his
ramblings
were
complicated
by
the
necessity
laid
on
him
of
starting
from
and
getting
back
to
it
so
much
barbara
made
out
after
she
had
copied
the
first
forty
pages
making
the
first
clearing
in
waddington
jungle
the
clearings
she
explained
to
ralph
broke
your
heart
it
was
till
you
got
the
thing
all
clean
and
tidy
that
you
realized
the
deep
spiritual
confusion
that
lay
behind
it
after
that
fortieth
page
the
ramblings
piled
and
mixed
themselves
in
three
interpenetrating
layers
first
there
was
the
original
layer
of
waddington
then
a
layer
of
ralph
superimposed
on
waddington
and
striking
down
into
him
then
a
top
layer
of
waddington
striking
down
into
ralph
first
the
primeval
chaos
of
waddington
then
ralph
spirit
moving
over
it
and
bringing
in
light
and
order
then
waddington
again
invading
it
and
beating
it
all
back
to
darkness
and
confusion
from
the
moment
ralph
came
into
it
the
progress
of
the
book
was
a
struggle
between
these
two
principles
and
waddington
could
never
let
ralph
be
so
determined
was
he
to
stamp
the
book
with
his
own
personality
after
all
ralph
said
it
his
book
if
he
could
only
get
away
from
wyck
so
that
you
could
see
where
the
other
places
she
moaned
he
ca
get
away
from
it
because
he
ca
get
away
from
himself
his
mind
is
egocentric
and
his
ego
lives
in
wyck
barbara
had
had
to
ask
ralph
to
help
her
they
were
in
the
library
together
now
working
on
the
ramblings
during
one
of
periodical
flights
to
london
he
thinks
he
rambling
round
the
country
but
he
really
rambling
round
and
round
himself
all
the
time
he
thinking
about
nothing
but
his
blessed
self
oh
come
he
thought
a
lot
about
his
old
league
no
the
league
was
only
an
extension
of
his
ego
that
must
have
been
what
fanny
meant
we
were
looking
at
his
portrait
and
i
said
i
wondered
what
he
was
thinking
about
and
she
said
she
used
to
wonder
and
now
she
knew
of
course
it
himself
that
what
makes
him
look
so
absurdly
solemn
yes
but
think
of
it
think
that
man
has
ever
cared
about
anything
or
anybody
but
himself
oh
he
cares
about
fanny
no
no
he
does
he
cares
about
his
wife
a
very
different
thing
well
he
cares
about
his
old
mother
he
really
cares
yes
and
you
know
why
it
only
because
she
makes
him
feel
young
he
hates
horry
because
he
ca
feel
young
when
he
there
why
oh
why
did
that
angel
fanny
marry
him
because
she
is
an
angel
she
a
mortal
woman
and
she
wanted
a
husband
and
children
was
there
anybody
else
i
believe
not
available
the
man
she
ought
to
have
married
was
married
already
did
my
mother
marry
him
yes
and
mother
married
the
next
best
one
it
was
as
plain
and
simple
as
all
that
and
you
see
the
plainer
and
simpler
it
was
the
more
she
realized
why
she
was
marrying
horatio
the
more
she
idealized
him
it
wanted
camouflage
i
see
then
you
must
remember
her
people
were
badly
off
and
he
helped
them
he
was
always
doing
things
for
them
he
managed
all
fanny
affairs
for
her
before
he
married
her
then
he
does
kind
things
lots
when
he
wants
to
get
something
he
wanted
to
get
fanny
besides
he
does
them
to
get
power
to
get
a
hold
on
you
it
really
for
himself
all
the
time
it
gives
him
a
certain
simplicity
and
purity
he
is
a
snob
he
does
think
about
his
money
or
his
property
or
his
ancestors
he
got
heaps
quite
good
ones
they
do
matter
nothing
matters
but
himself
how
about
his
book
does
that
matter
it
does
and
yet
again
it
does
he
pretends
he
only
doing
it
to
amuse
himself
but
it
really
a
projection
of
his
ego
into
the
cotswolds
on
the
other
hand
he
hate
it
if
you
took
him
for
a
writing
man
when
he
horatio
bysshe
waddington
that
how
he
got
it
into
such
a
mess
because
he
ca
get
away
from
himself
and
his
manor
proud
of
his
manor
anyhow
oh
yes
not
mind
you
because
it
perfect
tudor
of
the
sixteenth
century
because
the
earl
of
warwick
gave
it
to
his
but
because
it
his
manor
horatio
bysshe
waddington
manor
of
course
it
got
to
be
what
it
is
because
any
other
sort
of
manor
would
be
good
enough
for
bysshe
it
an
extension
of
his
ego
too
yes
horatio
ego
spreading
itself
in
wings
and
bursting
into
gables
and
overflowing
into
a
lovely
garden
and
a
park
there
is
a
tree
there
is
a
flower
that
has
got
bits
of
horatio
in
it
if
i
thought
that
i
should
never
want
to
see
roses
and
larkspurs
again
it
only
happens
in
horatio
mind
but
it
does
happen
so
between
them
bit
by
bit
they
made
him
out
and
they
made
out
the
book
here
and
there
on
separate
slips
were
great
outlying
tracts
of
light
contributed
by
ralph
to
be
inserted
and
sketches
of
dark
undeveloped
stuff
sprung
from
waddington
to
be
inserted
too
neither
ralph
nor
barbara
could
make
them
fit
the
only
thing
was
to
copy
it
out
clear
as
it
stood
and
arrange
it
afterwards
and
presently
it
appeared
that
two
pages
were
missing
one
evening
the
evening
of
waddington
return
looking
for
the
lost
pages
barbara
made
her
great
discovery
a
sheaf
of
manuscript
a
hundred
and
twenty
pages
in
ralph
handwriting
hidden
away
at
the
back
of
the
bureau
crumpled
as
if
an
inimical
hand
had
thrust
it
out
of
sight
she
took
it
up
to
bed
and
read
it
there
a
hundred
and
twenty
pages
of
pure
ralph
without
any
taint
of
waddington
it
seemed
to
be
part
of
waddington
book
and
yet
no
part
of
it
for
it
was
inconceivable
that
it
should
belong
to
anything
but
itself
ralph
did
ramble
he
went
straight
for
the
things
he
had
seen
he
saw
the
cotswolds
round
he
made
you
see
them
as
they
were
the
high
curves
of
the
hills
multiplied
thrown
off
one
after
another
the
squares
and
oblongs
and
vandykes
and
spread
fans
of
the
fields
and
their
many
colours
grass
green
of
the
pastures
emerald
green
of
the
young
wheat
white
green
of
the
barley
shining
metallic
green
of
the
turnips
the
pink
the
brown
the
purple
fallows
the
sharp
canary
yellow
of
the
charlock
and
the
trees
the
long
processions
of
trees
by
the
great
roads
trees
furring
the
flanks
and
groins
of
the
parted
hills
dark
combs
topping
their
edges
ralph
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
went
about
with
the
farmers
and
farm
hands
he
followed
the
ploughing
and
sowing
and
the
reaping
the
feeding
and
milking
of
the
cattle
the
care
of
the
ewes
in
labour
and
of
the
young
lambs
he
went
at
night
to
the
upland
folds
with
the
shepherds
he
could
tell
you
about
shepherds
he
sat
with
the
village
women
by
their
firesides
and
listened
to
their
talk
he
could
tell
you
about
village
women
waddington
did
not
tell
you
about
anything
that
mattered
she
took
the
manuscript
to
ralph
at
the
white
hart
with
a
note
to
say
how
she
had
found
it
he
came
running
out
to
walk
home
with
her
did
you
know
it
was
there
she
said
no
i
thought
i
lost
it
you
see
what
it
is
part
of
your
book
horatio
book
but
you
wrote
it
yes
that
what
he
fired
me
out
for
he
got
tired
of
the
thing
and
asked
me
to
go
on
with
it
he
called
it
working
up
his
material
i
went
on
with
it
like
that
and
he
would
have
it
he
said
it
was
badly
written
jerky
short
sentences
he
have
to
it
well
i
would
let
him
do
that
and
he
would
have
it
as
it
stood
but
it
beautiful
alive
and
real
what
more
does
he
want
the
stamp
of
his
personality
oh
he
on
it
all
right
i
glad
you
like
it
it
do
you
ralph
said
he
thought
he
liked
it
when
he
wrote
it
but
now
he
know
you
know
when
you
finished
it
i
do
suppose
i
shall
finish
it
he
said
but
you
must
you
ca
finish
a
thing
like
that
i
own
i
like
to
but
i
ca
publish
it
why
ever
not
oh
it
would
be
fair
to
poor
old
waddy
after
all
i
wrote
it
for
him
what
on
earth
does
that
matter
if
he
does
want
it
of
course
finish
it
and
of
course
you
publish
it
well
but
it
all
cotswold
you
see
and
cotswold
if
it
any
good
you
know
i
should
like
to
to
well
get
in
his
way
his
game
at
least
he
began
it
it
a
game
two
can
play
writing
cotswold
books
no
no
it
is
and
he
got
in
first
well
then
let
him
get
in
first
you
can
bring
your
book
out
after
and
dish
his
no
let
it
have
a
run
first
perhaps
it
wo
have
any
run
perhaps
mine
wo
that
heavenly
book
and
his
tosh
do
you
see
that
you
get
in
his
way
if
anybody
reads
him
they
wo
be
the
same
people
who
read
you
i
hope
not
all
the
same
it
would
be
rather
beastly
to
cut
him
out
i
mean
to
come
in
and
do
it
better
show
how
bad
he
is
how
frightful
it
would
rub
it
in
you
know
not
with
him
you
could
you
do
know
some
brute
might
get
up
and
hurt
him
with
it
oh
you
tender
to
him
well
you
see
i
did
let
him
down
when
i
left
him
besides
it
altogether
him
there
fanny
fanny
she
love
you
to
write
your
book
i
know
she
think
she
would
but
she
would
like
it
if
it
made
horatio
look
a
fool
but
he
bound
to
look
a
fool
in
any
case
true
i
might
give
him
a
year
or
two
years
well
then
work
cut
out
for
me
i
shall
have
to
make
horatio
go
on
and
finish
quick
so
as
not
to
keep
you
waiting
he
get
sick
of
it
he
make
you
go
on
with
it
practically
and
quarrel
with
every
word
you
write
unless
you
can
write
so
like
horatio
that
he
think
he
done
it
himself
and
then
you
know
he
wo
have
a
word
of
mine
left
in
you
have
to
take
me
out
and
we
so
mixed
up
together
that
i
do
believe
even
he
could
sort
us
you
see
in
order
to
appease
him
i
got
into
the
way
of
giving
my
sentences
a
waddingtonian
twist
if
only
i
could
have
kept
it
up
i
have
to
lick
the
thing
into
shape
somehow
there
only
one
thing
you
have
to
do
you
must
make
him
steer
a
proper
course
this
is
to
be
guide
to
the
cotswolds
you
have
him
sending
people
back
to
lower
wyck
manor
all
the
time
have
to
know
all
the
places
and
all
the
ways
and
i
do
no
but
i
do
supposing
i
took
you
on
my
would
you
awfully
mind
sitting
on
the
carrier
do
you
think
she
said
he
let
me
go
fanny
will
i
i
think
i
work
so
hard
in
the
mornings
and
evenings
that
they
given
me
all
the
afternoons
we
might
go
every
afternoon
while
the
weather
holds
out
he
said
and
then
i
say
he
bring
us
together
that
was
how
barbara
happy
life
began
he
did
bring
them
together
in
the
terrible
months
that
followed
while
she
struggled
for
order
and
clarity
against
waddington
who
strove
to
reinstate
himself
in
his
obscure
confusion
barbara
was
sustained
by
the
thought
that
in
working
for
waddington
she
was
working
for
ralph
bevan
the
harder
she
worked
for
him
the
harder
she
worked
for
ralph
with
all
her
cunning
and
her
little
indomitable
will
she
urged
and
drove
him
to
get
on
and
make
way
for
ralph
waddington
interposed
all
sorts
of
irritating
obstructions
and
delays
he
would
sit
for
hours
brooding
solemnly
equally
unable
to
finish
and
to
abandon
any
paragraph
he
had
once
begun
he
had
left
the
high
roads
and
was
rambling
now
in
of
such
intricacy
that
he
was
unable
to
give
any
clear
account
of
himself
when
barbara
had
made
a
clean
copy
of
it
waddington
part
did
always
make
sense
the
only
bits
that
could
stand
by
themselves
were
bits
and
they
were
the
bits
that
waddington
would
let
stand
the
very
clearness
of
the
copy
was
a
light
flaring
on
the
hopeless
mess
it
was
even
waddington
could
see
it
do
you
think
she
said
we
got
it
all
down
in
the
right
order
she
pointed
that
she
could
see
his
hands
twitching
with
annoyance
his
loose
cheeks
hung
shaking
as
he
brooded
that
not
as
wrote
it
he
said
at
last
that
ralph
bevan
he
was
a
bit
of
good
to
me
there
there
no
end
to
the
harm
done
conceited
fellow
full
of
himself
and
his
own
ideas
now
i
shall
have
to
go
over
every
line
he
written
and
write
it
again
i
rather
write
a
dozen
books
myself
than
patch
up
another
fellow
bad
work
we
got
to
overhaul
the
whole
thing
and
take
out
whatever
he
done
but
you
so
mixed
up
you
ca
always
tell
he
looked
at
her
you
may
be
sure
that
if
any
passage
is
obscure
or
confused
or
badly
written
it
is
mine
the
one
you
shown
me
for
example
then
barbara
had
another
of
her
ideas
since
they
were
so
mixed
up
together
that
waddington
could
tell
which
was
which
and
since
he
wanted
to
give
the
impression
that
ralph
was
responsible
for
all
the
bad
bits
and
insisted
on
the
complete
elimination
of
ralph
she
had
only
got
to
eliminate
the
bad
bits
and
give
such
a
waddingtonian
turn
to
the
good
ones
that
he
would
be
persuaded
that
he
had
written
them
himself
the
great
thing
was
he
said
that
the
book
should
be
written
by
himself
and
once
fairly
extricated
from
his
own
entanglements
and
set
going
on
a
clear
path
with
barbara
to
pull
him
out
of
all
the
awkward
places
waddington
rambled
along
through
the
cotswolds
at
a
smooth
easy
pace
barbara
had
contrived
to
break
him
of
his
wasteful
and
expensive
habit
of
returning
from
everywhere
to
wyck
all
through
august
he
kept
a
steady
course
northeast
north
northwest
by
september
he
had
turned
due
south
he
would
be
beating
up
east
again
by
october
november
would
find
him
in
the
valleys
there
was
no
reason
why
he
finish
in
december
and
come
out
in
march
waddington
himself
was
surprised
at
the
progress
he
had
made
it
shows
he
said
what
we
can
do
without
ralph
bevan
and
barbara
seated
on
ralph
carrier
explored
the
countryside
and
mapped
out
waddington
course
for
him
she
worth
a
dozen
ralph
bevins
he
would
say
and
he
would
go
to
the
door
with
her
and
see
her
start
you
must
let
yourself
be
victimized
by
ralph
he
said
he
glanced
at
the
carrier
do
you
think
it
safe
quite
safe
if
it
is
it
only
be
a
bit
more
thrilling
much
better
to
come
in
the
car
with
me
but
barbara
would
go
in
the
car
with
him
when
he
talked
about
it
she
looked
frightened
and
embarrassed
her
fright
and
her
embarrassment
were
delicious
to
waddington
he
said
to
himself
she
does
think
safe
anyhow
and
as
he
watched
her
rushing
away
swaying
exquisitely
over
a
series
of
terrific
explosions
he
gave
a
little
skip
and
a
half
turn
light
and
youthful
in
the
porch
of
his
manor
ix
sir
john
corbett
had
called
in
the
morning
he
had
exerted
himself
to
that
extent
out
of
friendship
pure
friendship
for
waddington
and
he
had
chosen
an
early
hour
for
his
visit
to
mark
it
as
a
serious
and
extraordinary
occasion
he
sat
now
in
the
brown
leather
armchair
which
was
twin
to
the
one
waddington
had
sat
in
when
he
had
his
portrait
painted
his
jolly
rosy
face
was
subdued
to
something
serious
and
extraordinary
he
had
come
to
warn
waddington
that
scandal
was
beginning
to
attach
itself
to
his
acquaintance
he
was
going
to
say
relations
but
remembered
just
in
time
that
relations
was
a
word
to
his
acquaintance
with
a
certain
lady
to
which
waddington
replied
haughtily
that
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
choose
his
er
acquaintance
his
acquaintance
was
his
own
affair
quite
so
my
dear
fellow
quite
so
but
strictly
between
ourselves
is
it
a
good
thing
to
choose
acquaintances
of
the
sort
that
give
rise
to
scandal
as
a
man
of
the
world
now
between
ourselves
does
it
strike
you
that
the
lady
in
question
may
be
that
sort
it
does
not
strike
me
said
waddington
and
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
strike
you
i
do
like
the
look
of
her
said
sir
john
quoting
major
markham
if
you
trying
to
suggest
that
she
not
straight
you
reading
something
into
her
look
that
is
there
come
waddington
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
when
a
man
knocked
about
the
world
like
you
and
me
he
gets
an
instinct
he
can
tell
pretty
well
by
looking
at
her
whether
a
woman
that
sort
or
not
my
dear
corbett
my
instinct
is
at
least
as
good
as
yours
i
known
levitt
for
three
years
and
i
can
assure
she
as
straight
as
innocent
as
your
wife
or
mine
clever
clever
and
a
bit
unscrupulous
again
sir
john
quoted
major
markham
a
woman
like
that
can
get
round
simple
fellows
like
you
and
me
waddington
in
no
time
if
she
gives
her
mind
to
it
that
why
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
her
she
may
be
as
straight
and
innocent
as
you
please
but
somehow
or
other
she
causing
a
great
deal
of
unpleasant
talk
and
if
i
were
you
i
drop
her
drop
her
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
my
dear
fellow
that
all
very
well
but
when
everybody
knows
your
wife
has
called
on
her
there
was
no
need
for
fanny
to
call
on
her
my
relations
with
levitt
were
on
a
purely
business
footing
well
i
leave
them
there
and
not
too
much
footing
either
what
can
i
do
here
she
is
a
war
widow
with
nobody
but
me
to
look
after
her
interests
she
got
into
the
way
of
coming
to
me
and
i
not
going
back
on
the
poor
woman
corbett
because
of
your
absurd
insinuations
not
insinuations
anybody
insinuations
then
nobody
has
a
right
to
insinuate
anything
about
as
for
fanny
she
make
a
point
of
calling
on
her
now
we
were
talking
about
it
not
long
ago
a
bit
hard
on
waddington
to
be
let
in
for
that
you
need
worry
fanny
can
afford
to
do
pretty
well
what
she
likes
he
had
him
there
sir
john
knew
that
this
was
true
of
fanny
waddington
as
it
was
not
true
of
lady
corbett
he
could
remember
the
time
when
nobody
called
on
his
father
and
mother
and
lady
corbett
could
not
yet
afford
to
call
on
levitt
before
anybody
else
did
well
he
said
so
long
as
levitt
does
expect
my
wife
to
follow
suit
levitt
experience
ca
have
led
her
to
expect
much
in
the
way
of
kindness
here
well
do
be
too
kind
you
do
know
how
you
may
be
landed
you
do
know
said
sir
john
fatally
what
ideas
you
may
have
put
into
the
poor
woman
head
i
should
be
very
sorry
said
waddington
if
i
thought
for
one
moment
i
had
roused
any
warmer
feelings
but
he
was
sorry
he
tried
hard
to
make
his
face
express
a
chivalrous
regret
and
it
would
it
was
positively
smiling
so
agreeable
was
the
idea
conveyed
by
sir
john
he
turned
it
over
and
over
drawing
out
its
delicious
flavour
while
sir
john
little
laughing
eyes
observed
his
enjoyment
you
do
know
he
said
you
may
have
roused
there
was
something
very
irritating
in
his
fat
chuckle
you
need
disturb
yourself
these
things
will
happen
a
woman
may
be
carried
away
by
her
feelings
but
if
a
man
has
any
tact
and
any
delicacy
he
can
always
show
her
very
well
without
breaking
off
all
relations
that
would
be
clumsy
of
course
if
you
want
to
keep
up
with
her
keep
up
with
her
only
take
care
you
do
get
landed
that
all
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
for
the
lady
own
sake
i
shall
take
care
they
rose
waddington
stood
looking
down
at
sir
john
and
his
little
round
stomach
and
his
little
round
eyes
with
their
obscene
twinkle
and
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
feel
the
indignation
he
would
like
to
have
felt
as
his
eyes
encountered
sir
john
something
secret
and
primitive
in
waddington
responded
to
that
obscene
twinkle
something
reminiscent
and
anticipating
something
mischievous
and
subtle
and
delightful
subversive
of
dignity
it
came
up
in
his
solemn
face
and
simmered
there
here
was
corbett
a
man
of
the
world
and
he
took
it
for
granted
that
levitt
feelings
had
been
roused
he
acknowledged
handsomely
as
male
to
male
the
fascination
that
had
roused
them
he
corbett
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
he
saw
the
whole
possibility
of
romantic
adventure
with
such
flattering
certitude
that
it
was
impossible
to
feel
any
resentment
at
the
same
time
his
interference
was
a
piece
of
abominable
impertinence
and
waddington
resented
that
it
made
him
more
than
ever
determined
to
pursue
his
relations
with
levitt
just
to
show
he
was
going
to
be
dictated
to
while
the
very
fact
that
corbett
saw
him
as
a
figure
of
romantic
adventure
intensified
the
excitement
of
the
pursuit
and
though
elise
seen
with
certainty
in
the
light
of
intimations
was
not
quite
so
enthralling
to
the
fancy
as
the
elise
of
his
doubt
she
made
a
more
positive
and
formidable
appeal
to
his
desire
he
loved
his
desire
because
it
made
him
feel
young
and
loving
it
he
thought
he
loved
elise
and
what
corbett
was
thinking
markham
and
thurston
and
hawtrey
and
young
hawtrey
and
grainger
would
be
thinking
too
they
would
all
see
him
as
the
still
young
romantic
adventurer
the
inspirer
of
passion
and
bevan
but
no
he
did
want
bevan
to
see
him
like
that
or
rather
he
did
and
yet
again
he
did
he
had
scruples
when
it
came
to
bevan
because
of
fanny
and
because
of
fanny
while
he
rioted
in
visions
of
the
possible
he
dreaded
more
than
anything
an
actual
detection
the
raking
eyes
and
furtive
tongues
of
the
townspeople
if
fanny
called
on
levitt
it
would
stop
all
the
talking
that
was
how
fanny
came
to
know
levitt
and
how
levitt
and
toby
came
to
be
asked
to
the
september
garden
party
at
lower
wyck
manor
levitt
of
the
white
house
gloucestershire
she
thought
it
sounded
very
well
she
had
been
out
that
is
to
say
she
had
judged
it
more
becoming
to
her
dignity
not
to
be
at
home
when
fanny
called
and
fanny
had
been
actually
out
when
levitt
called
so
that
they
met
for
the
first
time
at
the
garden
party
it
absurd
our
not
knowing
each
other
fanny
said
when
my
husband
knows
you
so
well
i
always
felt
waddington
that
i
ought
to
know
you
if
only
to
tell
you
how
good
he
been
to
me
but
of
course
you
know
it
i
know
it
quite
well
he
always
being
good
to
people
he
likes
it
you
must
take
off
some
of
the
credit
for
that
she
thought
she
has
really
very
beautiful
eyes
a
lot
of
credit
would
have
to
be
taken
off
for
her
eyes
too
but
is
that
said
levitt
what
being
good
to
like
being
it
only
i
suppose
that
just
what
lays
him
open
she
lowered
the
eyes
whose
brilliance
had
blazed
a
moment
ago
on
fanny
she
toyed
with
her
handbag
smiling
a
little
secret
roguish
smile
that
lays
him
open
levitt
looked
up
smiling
to
the
attacks
of
unscrupulous
people
like
me
it
was
risky
but
it
showed
a
masterly
boldness
and
presence
of
mind
it
was
as
if
she
and
fanny
waddington
had
had
their
eyes
fixed
on
a
live
scorpion
approaching
them
over
the
lawn
and
levitt
had
stooped
down
and
grasped
it
by
its
tail
and
tossed
it
into
the
lavender
bushes
as
if
levitt
had
said
my
dear
waddington
we
both
know
that
this
horrible
creature
exists
but
we
are
going
to
let
it
sting
us
as
if
she
knew
why
fanny
had
called
on
her
and
was
grateful
to
her
perhaps
if
levitt
had
never
appeared
at
that
garden
party
or
if
having
appeared
she
had
never
been
introduced
at
their
own
request
to
major
markham
thurston
hawtrey
and
young
hawtrey
and
sir
john
corbett
waddington
might
never
have
realized
the
full
extent
of
her
fascination
she
had
made
herself
the
centre
of
the
party
by
her
sheer
power
to
seize
attention
and
to
hold
it
you
could
help
looking
at
her
again
and
again
where
she
sat
in
a
clearing
of
the
lawn
playing
the
clever
pointed
play
of
her
black
and
white
black
satin
frock
black
satin
cloak
lined
with
white
silk
furred
with
ermine
white
stockings
and
long
white
gloves
the
close
black
satin
hat
clipping
her
head
the
vivid
contrast
and
stress
repeated
in
white
skin
black
hair
black
eyes
black
eyes
and
fine
mouth
and
white
teeth
making
a
charming
and
perpetual
movement
she
had
been
talking
to
major
markham
for
the
last
ten
minutes
displaying
herself
as
the
absurdly
youthful
mother
of
a
son
toby
levitt
a
tall
and
slender
likeness
of
his
mother
was
playing
tennis
with
distinction
ignoring
young
horace
his
partner
standing
well
up
to
the
net
and
repeating
the
alternate
smashing
and
sliding
strokes
that
kept
ralph
and
barbara
bounding
from
one
end
of
the
court
to
the
other
levitt
was
trying
to
reconcile
the
proficiency
of
toby
play
with
his
immunity
from
conscription
in
the
late
war
the
war
led
straight
to
major
markham
battery
and
major
markham
battery
to
the
battery
once
commanded
by
toby
father
which
led
to
poona
and
the
great
discovery
you
do
mean
frank
levitt
captain
in
the
gunners
i
do
was
he
by
any
chance
stationed
at
poona
in
eleven
he
was
but
bless
my
soul
was
my
dick
dick
best
friend
the
major
slightly
ironical
homage
had
given
place
to
a
serious
excitement
a
respectful
interest
oh
dicky
benham
is
rather
i
heard
him
talk
about
frank
levitt
scores
of
times
do
you
hear
that
waddington
levitt
knows
all
my
sister
people
why
on
earth
have
we
met
before
waddington
writhed
while
between
them
they
reeled
off
a
long
series
of
names
people
and
places
each
a
link
joining
up
major
markham
and
levitt
the
major
was
so
excited
about
it
that
he
went
round
the
garden
telling
thurston
and
hawtrey
and
corbett
so
that
presently
all
these
gentlemen
formed
round
levitt
an
interested
and
animated
group
waddington
hovered
miserably
on
the
edge
of
it
short
of
thrusting
markham
aside
with
his
elbow
markham
for
choice
he
have
broken
through
he
would
give
it
up
and
go
away
and
be
drawn
back
again
and
again
but
though
levitt
could
see
him
plainly
no
summons
from
her
beautiful
eyes
invited
his
approach
his
behaviour
became
noticeable
it
was
observed
chiefly
by
his
son
horry
horry
took
barbara
apart
i
say
have
you
seen
my
no
what
where
she
could
see
by
his
face
that
he
was
drawing
her
into
some
iniquitous
secret
of
diversion
there
just
behind
you
turn
round
this
way
but
do
look
as
if
you
spotted
him
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
him
he
like
a
newfoundland
dog
trying
to
look
over
a
gate
it
would
be
half
so
funny
if
he
was
so
dignified
all
the
time
she
did
approve
of
horry
he
was
decent
but
the
dignity
it
wonderful
horry
went
on
what
on
earth
did
the
mater
ask
that
woman
for
she
might
have
known
he
make
a
fool
of
himself
oh
horry
you
must
it
awful
of
you
you
really
a
little
beast
i
not
fancy
doing
it
at
his
own
garden
party
he
never
thinks
of
look
at
the
dear
little
mater
there
pretending
she
does
see
him
what
makes
me
mad
barbara
well
you
ought
to
pretend
you
do
see
it
too
i
been
pretending
the
whole
blessed
afternoon
but
it
no
good
pretending
with
you
jolly
well
see
everything
i
do
go
and
draw
other
people
attention
to
it
oh
come
how
about
ralph
you
know
you
would
let
him
miss
him
ralph
oh
ralph
different
i
should
point
him
out
to
lady
corbett
no
more
should
i
different
too
you
and
ralph
and
me
are
the
only
people
capable
of
appreciating
him
though
i
would
swear
that
the
mater
does
sometimes
yes
but
you
go
too
far
horry
you
cruel
to
him
and
we
not
it
all
very
well
for
you
he
is
your
father
oh
lord
craning
his
neck
over
markham
shoulder
now
what
his
face
must
look
like
from
the
other
side
if
you
found
your
father
drunk
under
a
lilac
bush
i
believe
you
go
and
fetch
me
to
look
at
him
i
would
if
he
was
as
funny
as
he
is
now
but
i
say
you
know
i
ca
have
him
going
on
like
that
i
got
to
stop
it
somehow
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
me
do
i
think
i
should
ask
him
to
go
and
take
lady
corbett
in
to
tea
good
horry
strode
up
to
his
father
i
say
pater
are
you
going
to
take
lady
corbett
in
to
tea
at
the
sheer
sound
of
his
son
voice
waddington
dignity
stood
firm
but
he
went
off
to
find
lady
corbett
all
the
same
when
it
was
all
over
the
garden
party
was
pronounced
a
great
success
and
waddington
was
very
agreeably
rallied
on
his
discovery
taxed
with
trying
to
keep
it
to
himself
and
warned
that
he
was
going
to
have
it
all
his
own
way
it
our
turn
now
said
major
markham
to
have
a
look
in
and
their
turn
was
constantly
coming
round
again
they
were
always
looking
in
at
the
white
house
first
major
markham
called
then
sir
john
corbett
of
underwoods
thurston
of
the
elms
and
hawtrey
of
medlicott
called
and
brought
their
wives
these
ladies
however
like
levitt
and
they
were
not
at
home
when
she
returned
their
calls
levitt
visiting
card
had
its
place
in
three
collections
and
there
the
matter
ended
but
thurston
and
hawtrey
continued
to
call
with
a
delightful
sense
of
doing
something
that
their
wives
considered
improper
major
markham
as
a
bachelor
his
movements
were
more
untrammelled
declared
it
his
ambition
to
cut
waddy
out
was
everlastingly
calling
at
the
white
house
his
fastidious
correctness
the
correctness
that
had
liked
the
look
of
her
excused
this
intensive
culture
of
levitt
on
the
grounds
that
she
was
well
connected
she
knew
all
his
sister
people
and
levitt
took
good
care
to
let
waddington
know
of
these
visits
and
of
her
little
bridge
parties
in
the
evening
just
thurston
and
hawtrey
and
major
markham
and
me
he
was
teased
and
worried
by
his
visions
of
elise
perpetually
surrounded
by
thurston
and
hawtrey
and
the
major
supposing
only
supposing
that
driven
by
despair
of
course
she
married
that
fellow
markham
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
waddington
experienced
jealousy
elise
had
ceased
to
be
the
subject
of
dreamy
doubtful
speculation
and
had
become
the
object
of
an
uneasy
passion
he
could
give
her
passion
if
it
was
passion
that
she
wanted
but
because
of
fanny
he
could
not
give
her
a
position
in
the
county
and
it
was
just
possible
that
elise
might
prefer
a
position
and
elise
was
happy
happy
in
her
communion
with
thurston
and
hawtrey
and
in
the
thought
that
their
wives
detested
her
happy
in
her
increasing
intimacy
with
major
markham
and
in
her
consciousness
of
being
well
connected
above
all
happy
in
waddington
uneasiness
meanwhile
fanny
waddington
kept
on
calling
if
i
do
she
said
the
poor
woman
will
be
done
for
she
could
see
any
harm
in
levitt
barbara
and
ralph
bevan
had
been
for
one
of
their
long
walks
they
were
coming
back
down
the
park
when
they
met
first
henry
the
boy
carrying
a
basket
of
fat
golden
pears
where
are
you
going
with
those
lovely
pears
henry
levitt
miss
the
boy
grinned
and
twinkled
you
could
almost
have
fancied
that
he
knew
farther
on
near
the
white
gate
they
could
see
waddington
and
two
ladies
he
had
evidently
gone
out
to
open
the
gate
and
was
walking
on
with
them
unable
to
tear
himself
away
the
ladies
were
rickards
and
levitt
they
stopped
you
could
see
the
flutter
of
their
hands
and
faces
suggesting
a
final
triangular
exchange
of
playfulness
then
waddington
executing
a
complicated
movement
of
farewell
a
bow
and
a
half
turn
a
gambolling
skip
the
gesture
of
his
ungovernable
youth
then
as
he
went
from
them
the
abandonment
of
rickards
and
levitt
to
disgraceful
laughter
levitt
clutched
her
sister
arm
and
clung
to
it
almost
perceptibly
reeling
as
if
she
said
hold
me
up
or
i
shall
collapse
it
too
much
too
too
too
too
much
they
came
on
with
a
peculiar
rolling
helpless
walk
rocked
by
the
intolerable
explosions
of
their
mirth
dabbing
their
mouths
and
eyes
with
their
in
a
tortured
struggle
for
control
they
recovered
sufficiently
to
pass
ralph
and
barbara
with
serious
sidelong
bows
and
then
there
was
a
sound
a
thin
wheezing
soaring
yet
stifled
sound
the
cry
of
a
conquered
hysteria
did
you
see
that
ralph
i
did
i
heard
it
could
could
he
oh
lord
no
they
appreciate
him
too
barbara
that
is
the
way
she
said
we
do
want
him
appreciated
that
way
that
rich
gross
way
no
it
is
nearly
subtle
enough
any
fool
could
see
that
his
caracoling
was
funny
they
do
know
him
as
we
know
him
they
know
what
he
really
is
it
was
an
outrage
it
like
taking
a
fine
thing
and
vulgarizing
it
they
no
and
it
was
cruel
too
to
laugh
at
him
like
that
before
his
back
was
turned
when
they
going
to
eat
his
pears
too
the
fact
is
barbara
nobody
appreciate
him
as
you
and
i
do
horry
no
not
horry
he
goes
too
far
horry
indecent
fanny
perhaps
sometimes
fanny
does
see
one
half
of
him
she
does
see
his
levitt
side
have
seen
it
barbara
of
course
i
have
you
never
told
me
it
is
fair
to
go
discovering
things
on
your
own
and
not
telling
me
we
must
make
a
compact
to
tell
each
other
the
very
instant
we
see
a
thing
we
might
keep
count
and
give
points
to
which
of
us
sees
most
levitt
ought
to
have
been
a
hundred
to
your
score
i
afraid
i
ca
score
with
levitt
you
saw
that
too
it
be
a
game
for
gods
barbara
but
ralph
there
might
be
things
we
tell
each
other
it
might
be
fair
to
him
telling
each
other
is
like
telling
other
people
hang
it
all
if
we
making
a
study
of
him
we
making
a
study
science
is
science
we
no
right
to
suppress
anything
at
any
moment
one
of
us
might
see
something
absolutely
vital
whatever
we
do
we
mus
be
unfair
to
him
but
he
ours
is
he
we
ca
be
unfair
to
him
and
we
got
to
be
fair
to
each
other
think
of
the
frightful
advantage
you
might
have
over
me
you
bound
to
see
more
things
than
i
do
i
might
see
more
but
you
understand
more
well
then
you
ca
do
without
me
it
a
compact
is
it
that
we
do
keep
things
back
as
for
levitt
handling
of
their
theme
they
resented
it
as
an
abominable
profanation
do
you
think
he
in
love
with
her
barbara
said
what
would
call
being
in
love
and
we
should
do
you
think
he
like
that
he
always
been
like
that
i
think
he
was
probably
that
when
he
was
young
before
he
married
fanny
before
he
married
fanny
and
after
after
i
should
imagine
he
went
pretty
straight
it
was
only
the
way
he
had
when
he
was
young
now
he
he
gone
back
to
it
just
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
young
still
i
take
it
the
poor
old
thing
got
scared
when
he
found
himself
past
fifty
and
he
to
start
a
proof
it
his
egoism
all
over
again
i
do
suppose
he
really
cares
a
rap
for
mrs
levitt
you
do
think
his
heart
beats
faster
when
he
sees
her
coming
i
do
horatio
heart
beats
faster
when
he
sees
himself
making
love
to
her
i
see
it
just
middle
age
just
middle
age
do
you
think
perhaps
fanny
does
see
it
no
not
that
not
that
at
least
i
hope
not
x
waddington
through
the
were
to
be
profusely
illustrated
the
question
was
photographs
or
original
drawings
and
he
had
decided
after
much
consideration
on
photographs
taken
by
pyecraft
man
for
a
book
of
such
capital
importance
the
work
of
an
inferior
or
obscure
illustrator
was
not
to
be
thought
of
for
an
instant
but
there
were
grave
disadvantages
in
employing
a
distinguished
artist
it
would
entail
not
only
heavy
expenses
but
a
disastrous
rivalry
the
illustrations
so
far
from
drawing
attention
to
the
text
and
fixing
it
firmly
there
would
inevitably
distract
it
and
the
artist
celebrated
name
would
have
to
figure
conspicuously
in
exact
proportion
to
his
celebrity
on
the
title
page
and
in
all
the
reviews
and
advertisements
where
properly
speaking
horatio
bysshe
waddington
should
stand
alone
it
was
even
possible
as
fanny
very
intelligently
pointed
out
that
a
sufficiently
distinguished
illustrator
might
succeed
in
capturing
the
enthusiasm
of
the
critics
to
the
utter
extinction
of
the
author
who
might
consider
himself
lucky
if
he
was
mentioned
at
all
but
fanny
had
shown
rather
less
intelligence
in
using
this
argument
to
support
her
suggestion
that
barbara
madden
should
illustrate
the
book
she
had
more
than
once
come
upon
the
child
sitting
on
a
above
levitt
house
making
a
sketch
of
the
steep
street
all
cream
white
and
pink
and
grey
opening
out
on
to
the
fields
and
the
blue
eastern
air
and
she
had
conceived
a
preposterous
admiration
for
barbara
madden
work
it
be
an
enchanting
book
if
she
illustrates
it
horatio
she
illustrates
it
but
when
he
tried
to
show
fanny
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
horatio
bysshe
waddington
illustrated
by
barbara
madden
she
laughed
in
his
face
and
told
him
he
was
a
conceited
old
thing
to
which
he
replied
with
dignified
that
he
was
writing
a
serious
and
important
book
it
would
be
foolish
to
pretend
that
it
was
not
serious
and
important
he
hoped
he
had
no
overweening
opinion
of
its
merits
but
one
must
preserve
some
sense
of
proportion
and
propriety
some
sanity
poor
little
barbara
it
is
poor
little
barbara
book
my
dear
no
said
fanny
it
is
meanwhile
if
the
book
was
to
be
ready
for
publication
in
the
spring
the
photographs
would
have
to
be
taken
at
once
before
the
light
and
the
leaves
were
gone
so
pyecraft
and
pyecraft
man
came
with
their
best
camera
and
photographed
and
photographed
as
long
as
the
fine
weather
lasted
they
photographed
the
market
square
they
photographed
the
church
they
photographed
lower
wyck
village
and
the
manor
house
the
residence
corrected
to
seat
of
horatio
bysshe
waddington
the
author
they
photographed
the
tudor
porch
showing
the
figures
of
the
author
and
of
waddington
his
wife
and
miss
barbara
madden
his
secretary
they
photographed
the
author
sitting
in
his
garden
they
photographed
him
in
his
park
mounted
on
his
mare
speedwell
and
they
photographed
him
in
his
then
they
came
in
and
looked
at
the
library
and
photographed
that
with
waddington
sitting
in
it
at
his
i
suppose
sir
pyecraft
said
you
wish
it
taken
from
one
end
to
show
the
proportions
certainly
said
waddington
and
when
pyecraft
came
the
next
day
with
the
proofs
he
said
i
think
sir
we
got
the
proportions
very
well
waddington
stared
at
the
proofs
holding
them
in
a
hand
that
trembled
slightly
with
emotion
with
a
just
annoyance
for
though
pyecraft
had
certainly
got
the
proportions
of
the
library
waddington
head
was
reduced
to
a
mere
black
spot
in
the
far
corner
if
was
what
pyecraft
meant
by
proportion
i
think
he
said
the
er
the
figure
is
not
quite
satisfactory
the
i
see
sir
i
did
not
understand
sir
that
you
wished
the
figure
waddington
did
like
to
appear
as
having
wished
the
figure
so
ardently
as
he
did
indeed
wish
it
if
i
to
be
there
at
all
quite
so
sir
but
if
you
wish
the
size
of
the
library
to
be
shown
i
am
afraid
the
figure
must
be
sacrificed
we
ca
do
you
it
both
ways
but
how
would
you
think
sir
of
being
photographed
yourself
somewhat
larger
seated
at
your
we
could
do
you
that
i
had
thought
of
it
pyecraft
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
thought
of
nothing
else
he
had
the
title
of
the
picture
in
his
mind
the
author
at
work
in
the
library
lower
wyck
manor
pyecraft
waited
in
deference
to
waddington
hesitation
his
man
less
delicate
but
more
discerning
was
already
preparing
to
adjust
the
camera
waddington
turned
like
a
man
torn
between
personal
distaste
and
public
duty
to
barbara
what
do
think
miss
madden
i
think
the
book
would
hardly
be
complete
without
you
very
well
you
hear
pyecraft
miss
madden
says
i
am
to
be
photographed
very
good
sir
he
wheeled
sportively
now
how
am
i
to
sit
if
you
would
set
yourself
so
sir
with
your
papers
before
you
spread
careless
so
and
your
pen
in
your
hand
so
a
little
nearer
bateman
the
figure
is
important
this
time
sir
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
look
up
waddington
looked
up
with
a
face
of
such
extraordinary
solemnity
that
pyecraft
smiled
in
spite
of
his
deference
a
leetle
brighter
expression
as
if
you
had
just
got
an
idea
waddington
imagined
himself
getting
an
idea
and
tried
to
look
like
it
perfect
perfect
pyecraft
almost
danced
with
excitement
keep
that
look
on
your
face
sir
half
a
moment
now
bateman
a
click
over
thank
goodness
said
waddington
reluctant
victim
of
pyecraft
and
barbara
importunity
after
that
pyecraft
and
his
man
were
driven
about
the
country
taking
photographs
in
one
of
them
waddington
appeared
standing
outside
the
mediaeval
market
hall
of
chipping
kingdon
in
another
wearing
fishing
boots
and
holding
a
in
his
hand
he
waded
knee
deep
in
the
trout
stream
between
upper
and
lower
speed
and
after
that
he
said
firmly
i
will
not
be
photographed
any
more
they
got
enough
of
me
in
november
when
the
photographing
was
done
fanny
went
away
to
london
for
a
fortnight
leaving
barbara
as
she
said
to
take
care
of
horatio
and
ralph
bevan
to
take
care
of
barbara
it
was
then
in
consequence
of
letters
he
received
from
levitt
that
waddington
visits
in
sheep
street
became
noticeably
frequent
barbara
sitting
on
her
above
the
white
house
noticed
them
she
noticed
too
the
singular
abstraction
of
waddington
manner
in
these
days
there
were
even
moments
when
he
ceased
to
take
any
interest
in
his
ramblings
and
left
barbara
to
continue
them
as
ralph
had
continued
them
alone
reserving
to
himself
the
authority
of
supervision
she
had
long
stretches
of
time
to
herself
when
she
had
reason
to
suspect
that
waddington
was
driving
leavitt
to
cheltenham
or
in
his
car
while
ralph
bevan
obeyed
fanny
parting
charge
to
look
after
barbara
every
time
barbara
did
a
piece
of
the
ramblings
she
showed
it
to
ralph
bevan
they
would
ride
off
together
into
the
open
country
and
barbara
would
read
aloud
to
ralph
sitting
by
the
roadside
where
they
lunched
or
in
some
inn
parlour
where
they
had
tea
they
had
decided
that
though
it
would
be
dishonourable
of
barbara
to
show
him
the
bits
that
waddington
had
written
there
could
be
no
earthly
harm
in
trusting
him
with
the
bits
she
had
done
herself
not
that
you
could
tell
the
difference
barbara
had
worked
hard
knowing
that
the
sooner
waddington
book
was
finished
the
sooner
book
would
come
out
and
under
this
agreeable
stimulus
she
had
developed
into
the
perfect
parodist
of
waddington
she
had
wallowed
in
waddington
style
till
she
was
saturated
with
it
and
wrote
automatically
about
bold
escarpments
and
the
rosy
flush
on
the
high
forehead
of
cleeve
cloud
about
houses
resting
in
the
shade
of
immemorial
elms
about
the
vale
of
the
windlode
awash
with
the
golden
light
of
even
and
grey
villages
nestling
in
the
hollows
of
the
hills
with
me
said
barbara
the
little
sheltered
valley
of
the
speed
let
us
follow
the
brown
trout
stream
that
goes
purling
barbara
it
priceless
what
made
you
think
of
purling
have
thought
of
it
through
the
lush
green
grass
of
the
meadows
or
us
away
along
the
great
high
road
that
runs
across
the
uplands
that
divide
the
valleys
of
the
windlode
and
the
thames
let
us
rest
a
moment
halfway
and
drink
no
quaff
a
mug
of
good
gloucestershire
ale
with
mine
host
of
the
merry
mouth
not
that
waddington
had
ever
done
such
a
thing
in
his
life
but
all
the
other
ramblers
through
the
cotswolds
did
it
or
said
they
did
it
and
he
was
saturated
with
their
spirit
as
barbara
was
saturated
with
his
he
could
see
them
robust
and
genial
young
men
in
tweed
knickerbocker
suits
tramping
their
thirty
miles
a
day
and
quaffing
mugs
of
ale
in
every
tavern
and
he
desired
to
present
himself
like
those
young
men
as
genial
and
robust
he
could
get
away
from
them
and
their
books
any
more
than
he
had
got
away
from
sir
maurice
gedge
and
his
prospectus
and
barbara
had
invented
all
sorts
of
robust
and
genial
things
for
him
to
do
she
dressed
him
in
pink
and
mounted
him
on
his
mare
speedwell
and
sent
him
flying

and
he

he
quaffed
and
he

he
did
his
thirty
miles
a
day
easily
she
set
down
long
conversations
between
waddington
and
old
billy
the
cotswold
shepherd
all
about
the
good
old
cotswold
ways
in
the
good
old
days
when
the
good
old
squire
father
no
his
grandfather
was
alive
do
call
to
mind
zur
what
old
squire
did
use
to
zay
to
me
billy
zays
your
grandchildren
wo
be
fed
nor
they
wo
the
cottages
nor
yet
the
clothes
as
you
and
your
children
as
zure
as
god
in
gloucester
zays
they
was
rare
old
times
zur
and
they
be
gawn
made
you
think
of
it
barbara
i
do
suppose
he
ever
said
two
words
to
old
billy
in
his
life
of
course
he
did
it
the
sort
of
thing
he
like
to
think
he
did
has
he
passed
it
rather
he
as
pleased
as
punch
he
thinks
he
forming
my
style
waddington
was
rapidly
acquiring
the
habit
of
going
round
to
sheep
street
after
dinner
but
in
those
evenings
that
he
did
not
devote
to
levitt
he
applied
himself
to
his
task
of
supervision
on
the
whole
he
was
delighted
with
his
secretary
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
little
thing
was
deeply
attached
to
him
you
could
tell
that
by
the
way
she
worked
by
her
ardour
and
eagerness
to
please
him
there
could
be
only
one
explanation
of
the
ease
with
which
she
had
received
the
stamp
of
his
personality
therefore
he
used
tact
he
used
tact
i
giving
you
a
great
deal
of
work
barbara
he
would
say
but
you
must
look
on
it
as
part
of
your
training
you
learning
to
write
good
english
there
nothing
like
clear
easy
flowing
sentences
you
have
literature
without
i
might
have
written
those
passages
myself
in
fact
i
can
hardly
distinguish
his
face
shook
over
it
she
noticed
the
tremor
of
imminent
revision
still
i
i
should
prefer
streams
here
to
streams
shakespearean
i
first
said
barbara
but
i
thought
would
be
nearer
to
what
you
have
written
yourself
i
forgot
about
shakespeare
and
babbling
is
exactly
purling
is
it
true
true
babbling
is
purling
we
want
the
exact
word
purling
let
it
be
and
good
girl
you
remembered
that
was
one
of
my
words
i
thought
it
be
good
you
see
said
waddington
how
you
learn
you
getting
the
sense
the
for
style
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
think
i
trained
you
barbara
and
you
may
be
very
thankful
it
i

ralph
bevan
of
all
the
jerky
eccentric
incoherent
xi
it
was
monday
the
day
of
november
in
the
last
week
of
fanny
fortnight
in
london
barbara
had
been
busy
all
morning
with
waddington
correspondence
and
accounts
and
now
for
the
first
time
she
found
herself
definitely
on
the
track
of
levitt
in
checking
palmer
and
hoskins
the
cheltenham
builders
bill
for
the
white
house
she
had
come
across
two
substantial
items
not
included
in
their
original
estimate
no
less
than
fifteen
by
eight
feet
of
trellis
for
the
garden
and
a
hot
water
pipe
rail
for
the
bathroom
it
turned
out
that
levitt
desiring
the
comfort
of
hot
towels
and
objecting
to
the
view
of
the
kitchen
yard
as
seen
from
the
lawn
had
incontinently
ordered
the
hot
water
rail
and
the
trellis
there
was
that
letter
from
jackson
and
cleaver
agents
informing
him
that
his
tenant
levitt
of
the
white
house
had
not
yet
paid
her
rent
due
on
the
of
september
did
waddington
wish
them
to
apply
again
and
there
were
other
letters
of
which
barbara
was
requested
to
make
copies
from
his
dictation
thus
my
dear
levitt
only
he
had
written
my
dear
elise
with
reference
to
your
investments
i
do
not
recommend
the
purchase
at
the
present
moment
of
government
housing
bonds
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
loan
you
the
fifty
pounds
you
require
to
make
up
the
five
hundred
for
the
purchase
of
parson
provincial
and
london
bank
shares
but
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
definitely
promise
an
advance
of
five
hundred
on
the
securities
you
name
that
promise
was
conditional
and
you
must
give
me
a
little
time
to
consider
the
matter
meanwhile
i
will
make
inquiries
but
speaking
i
should
say
that
owing
to
the
present
general
depreciation
of
stock
it
would
be
highly
unadvisable
for
you
to
sell
out
and
my
advice
to
you
would
be
hold
on
to
everything
you
got
i
am
very
glad
you
are
pleased
with
your
little
house
we
will
let
the
matter
of
the
rent
stand
over
till
your
affairs
are
rather
more
in
order
than
they
are
at
with
kindest
regards
very
sincerely

he
was
expecting
elise
for
tea
at
four
on

and
lawson

reached
him
very
opportunely
that
afternoon
dear

we
beg
to
inform

that

lawson
rutherford
it
was
clear
that
poor
elise
who
could
never
have
had
any
head
for
business
was
deceived
as
to
the
value
of
her
securities
it
might
even
be
that
with
regard
to
all
three
of
them
she
might
have
to
cut
her
losses
and
estimate
her
income
minus
the
dividends
accruing
from
this
source
but
that
only
made
it
the
more
imperative
that
she
should
have
at
least
a
thousand
pounds
tucked
snugly
away
in
some
safe
investment
nothing
short
of
the
addition
of
fifty
pounds
to
her
yearly
income
would
enable
elise
to
pay
her
way
the
dear
woman
affairs
ought
to
stand
on
a
sound
financial
basis
and
waddington
asked
himself
this
question
was
he
prepared
to
put
them
there
all
that
elise
could
offer
him
failing
her
depreciated
securities
was
the
reversion
of
a
legacy
of
five
hundred
pounds
promised
to
her
in
her
aunt
will
she
had
spoken
very
hopefully
of
this
legacy
was
he
prepared
to
fork
out
a
whole
five
hundred
pounds
on
the
offchance
of
elise
aunt
dying
within
a
reasonable
time
and
making
no
alteration
in
her
will
in
a
certain
contingency
he
prepared
he
was
prepared
to
do
all
that
and
more
for
elise
but
it
was
not
possible
it
was
not
decent
to
state
his
conditions
to
elise
beforehand
and
in
any
case
waddington
did
not
state
them
openly
as
conditions
to
himself
he
allowed
his
mind
to
be
muzzy
on
this
point
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
about
his
passion
but
he
preferred
to
contemplate
the
possibility
of
its
satisfaction
through
a
decent
veil
of
muzziness
when
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
like
to
know
where
he
stood
before
committing
himself
it
was
as
near
as
he
could
get
to
clarity
and
candour
and
when
he
wrote
to
elise
that
his
promise
was
conditional
he
really
did
mean
that
the
loan
would
depend
on
the
value
of
the
securities
offered
a
condition
that
his
integrity
could
face
a
condition
that
as
things
stood
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
make
while
all
the
time
deep
inside
him
was
the
knowledge
that
if
elise
gave
herself
to
him
he
would
not
ask
for
security
he
would
not
make
any
conditions
at
all
he
saw
elise
tender
and
yielding
in
his
arms
he
saw
himself
tender
and
powerful
stooping
over
her
and
he
thought
with
a
qualm
of
disgust
i
would
touch
her
poor
little
legacy
meanwhile
he
judged
it
well
to
let
the
correspondence
pass
like
any
other
business
correspondence
through
his
secretary
hands
it
was
well
to
let
barbara
see
that
his
relations
with
levitt
were
on
a
strictly
business
footing
that
he
had
nothing
to
hide
it
was
well
to
have
copies
of
the
letters
it
was
well
waddington
instinct
not
his
reason
told
him
it
wa
well
to
have
a
trustworthy
witness
to
all
these
transactions
a
witness
who
understood
the
precise
nature
of
his
conditions
in
the
event
the
highly
unlikely
event
of
trouble
with
elise
later
on
it
was
almost
as
if
secretly
he
had
a
premonition
also
when
his
conscience
reproached
him
as
it
did
with
making
conditions
with
asking
the
dear
woman
for
security
he
was
able
to
persuade
himself
that
he
did
really
mean
it
that
all
this
was
clever
camouflage
designed
to
turn
barbara
suspicions
if
she
ever
had
any
off
the
scent
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
sorry
that
barbara
should
see
him
in
his
rôle
of
generous
benefactor
and
shrewd
adviser
i
need
tell
you
barbara
that
all
this
business
is
strictly
private
as
my
confidential
secretary
you
have
to
know
a
great
many
things
it
would
do
to
have
talked
about
you
understand
perfectly
she
understood
too
that
it
was
an
end
of
the
compact
with
ralph
bevan
she
must
have
foreseen
this
affair
when
she
said
to
him
there
would
be
things
she
simply
could
tell
only
she
had
supposed
they
would
be
things
she
would
see
reward
of
clear
eyesight
not
things
she
would
be
regularly
let
in
for
knowing
and
her
clear
eyes
saw
through
the
camouflage
she
had
a
suspicion
i
do
see
she
said
why
you
should
have
to
go
without
your
rent
just
because
levitt
does
want
to
pay
it
she
was
sorry
for
waddy
he
might
be
ever
so
wise
about
affairs
but
he
was
a
perfect
goose
about
his
own
no
wonder
fanny
had
asked
her
to
take
care
of
him
i
no
doubt
he
said
she
to
pay
it
but
she
a
war
widow
barbara
and
she
hard
up
i
ca
rush
her
for
the
rent
she
no
business
to
rush
you
for
trellis
work
and
water
pipes
you
did
order
well
well
he
could
be
angry
with
the
child
she
was
so
loyal
so
careful
of
his
interests
and
he
could
expect
her
to
take
kindly
to
elise
there
would
be
a
natural
jealousy
that
palmer
and
mistake
i
ca
haggle
with
a
lady
barbara
but
he
winced
under
her
clear
eyes
she
thought
how
about
the
fifty
and
the
five
hundred
at
this
rate
might
him
to
do
anything
she
could
see
through
levitt
waddington
kept
on
looking
at
the
clock
it
was
now
ten
minutes
to
four
and
at
any
moment
elise
might
be
there
his
one
idea
was
to
get
barbara
madden
out
of
the
way
those
clear
eyes
were
not
the
eyes
he
wanted
to
be
looking
at
elise
to
be
looking
at
him
when
eyes
met
and
he
understood
that
that
fellow
bevan
was
going
to
call
for
her
at
four
he
did
want
about
where
are
you
going
for
your
walk
he
said
oh
anywhere
why
well
if
you
happen
to
be
in
wyck
would
you
mind
taking
these
photographs
back
to
pyecraft
and
showing
him
the
ones
i
chosen
just
see
that
he
does
make
any
stupid
mistake
the
photographs
were
staring
her
in
the
face
on
the
so
that
there
was
really
no
excuse
for
her
forgetting
them
as
she
did
but
waddington
experience
was
that
if
you
wanted
anything
done
you
had
to
do
it
yourself
elise
would
be
taken
into
the
he
went
to
wait
for
her
there
and
as
he
walked
up
and
down
restless
listening
for
the
sound
of
her
feet
on
the
gravel
drive
and
the
ringing
of
the
bell
at
each
turn
of
his
steps
he
was
arrested
by
his
own
portrait
it
stared
at
him
from
its
place
above
fanny
handsome
with
its
brilliant
black
and
carmine
it
gave
him
an
uneasy
sense
of
rivalry
as
if
he
felt
the
disagreeable
presence
of
a
younger
man
in
the
room
he
stared
back
at
it
he
stared
at
himself
in
the
great
over
the
chimneypiece
beside
it
he
remembered
fanny
saying
that
she
liked
the
of
his
moustache
and
hair
it
was
more
becoming
than
all
that
hard
shiny
black
fanny
was
right
it
more
becoming
and
his
skin
the
worn
bloom
of
it
like
a
delicate
sprinkling
of
powder
better
more
refined
than
that
rich
high
red
of
the
younger
man
in
the
gilt
frame
to
be
sure
his
eyes
blurred
onyx
bulged
out
of
creased
pouches
but
his
nose
the
postlethwaite
nose
a
very
handsome
feature
lifted
itself
firmly
above
the
fleshy
sagging
of
the
face
his
lips
pouted
in
pride
he
could
still
console
himself
with
the
thought
that
mirrors
were
unfaithful
elise
would
see
him
as
he
really
was
not
that
discoloured
and
distorted
image
he
pushed
out
his
great
chest
and
drew
a
deep
robust
breath
at
the
thought
of
elise
the
pride
the
rich
voluptuous
youthful
pride
of
life
mounted
and
as
he
turned
again
he
saw
fanny
looking
at
him
the
fanny
in
her
girl
white
frock
and
blue
sash
her
tilted
gainsborough
face
mischievous
and
mocking
smiled
as
if
she
were
making
fun
of
him
his
breath
caught
in
his
chest
fanny
fanny
his
wife
why
had
his
wife
the
loyalty
and
intelligence
of
barbara
the
enthusiasm
the
seriousness
of
elise
he
need
have
any
conscientious
scruples
on
fanny
account
she
had
driven
him
to
elise
with
her
frivolity
her
eternal
smiling
of
course
he
knew
that
she
cared
for
him
that
he
had
power
over
her
that
there
had
never
been
and
never
would
be
any
other
man
for
fanny
but
he
could
go
on
with
fanny
levity
for
ever
he
wanted
something
more
something
sound
and
solid
something
that
elise
gave
him
and
no
other
woman
any
man
would
want
it
and
yet
fanny
image
made
him
uneasy
watching
him
there
smiling
as
if
she
knew
all
about
elise
and
smiled
pretending
not
to
care
he
did
want
fanny
to
watch
him
with
elise
he
did
want
elise
to
see
fanny
when
he
looked
at
fanny
portrait
he
felt
again
his
old
repugnance
to
their
meeting
he
did
want
elise
to
sit
in
the
same
room
with
fanny
to
sit
in
fanny
chair
the
was
room
the
red
dahlia
and
parrot
chintz
was
fanny
choice
every
table
cabinet
and
chair
was
in
the
place
that
fanny
had
chosen
for
it
the
book
the
frivolous
book
she
had
been
reading
before
she
went
away
lay
on
her
little
table
fanny
was
fanny
and
elise
was
elise
he
rang
the
bell
and
told
partridge
to
show
levitt
into
the
library
and
to
bring
tea
there
the
library
was
room
he
could
do
what
he
liked
in
it
the
girl
fanny
laughed
at
him
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
as
he
went
suddenly
he
felt
tender
and
gentle
to
her
because
of
elise
when
elise
came
she
found
him
seated
in
his
armchair
absorbed
in
a
book
he
rose
in
a
dreamy
attitude
as
if
he
were
still
dazed
and
abstracted
with
his
reading
thus
at
the
very
start
he
gave
himself
the
advantage
he
showed
himself
superior
to
elise
intellectually
and
morally
superior
you
deep
in
it
i
interrupting
she
said
he
came
down
from
his
height
instantly
he
was
all
hers
no
i
was
only
trying
to
pass
the
time
till
you
came
i
late
then
ten
minutes
he
smiled
indulgent
elise
was
looking
handsomer
than
ever
the
light
november
chill
had
whipped
a
thin
flush
into
her
face
he
watched
her
as
she
took
off
her
dark
skunk
furs
and
her
coat
how
delightful
to
watch
a
woman
taking
off
her
things
the
pretty
gestures
of
abandonment
the
form
emerging
slimmer
that
was
one
of
the
things
you
thought
and
could
say
supposing
he
had
said
it
to
elise
would
she
have
minded
what
are
you
thinking
of
she
said
how
did
you
know
i
was
thinking
of
anything
your
face
it
tells
tales
only
nice
ones
to
you
my
dear
lady
ah
but
you
tell
would
you
like
me
to
not
if
it
naughty
your
face
looks
naughty
he
wheeled
delighted
now
how
does
my
face
look
when
it
naughty
oh
that
be
telling
it
just
as
well
you
should
know
was
it
as
naughty
as
all
that
then
yes
or
as
nice
they
kept
it
up
lightly
till
partridge
and
annie
trinder
came
tinkling
and
rattling
with
the
outside
the
door
as
if
waddington
thought
they
meant
to
warn
them
partridge
he
called
as
the
butler
was
going
partridge
if
sir
john
corbett
calls
you
can
show
him
in
here
but
i
not
at
home
to
anybody
else
clever
idea
that
he
is
coming
is
he
the
tiresome
old
thing
no
he
is
if
i
thought
he
was
for
one
minute
i
would
be
at
home
then
why
why
did
i
say
i
would
be
because
i
wanted
to
make
it
safe
for
you
elise
thus
tactfully
he
let
it
dawn
on
her
that
he
might
be
dangerous
we
do
want
to
be
interrupted
do
we
he
said
not
by
sir
john
corbett
he
drew
up
the
big
padded
sofa
square
before
the
fire
for
elise
all
his
movements
were
unconscious
innocent
of
deliberation
and
design
he
seated
himself
behind
the
diminutive
the
teapot
and
cups
were
like
dolls
things
in
his
great
hands
she
looked
at
him
at
his
slow
fingers
fumbling
with
the
sugar
tongs
would
you
like
me
to
pour
out
tea
for
you
she
said
he
started
visibly
he
would
like
it
at
all
he
was
going
to
allow
elise
to
put
herself
into
fanny
place
pouring
out
tea
for
him
as
if
she
was
his
wife
she
would
have
suggested
it
if
she
had
had
any
tact
or
any
delicacy
no
he
said
the
no
sounded
hard
and
ungracious
you
must
really
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
waiting
on
you
the
sugar
dropped
from
the
tongs
he
fumbled
again
madly
and
elise
smiled
damn
the
tongs
he
thought
damn
the
sugar
take
it
in
your
fingers
goose
she
said
goose
an
endearment
a
caress
it
softened
him
his
tenderness
for
elise
came
back
my
fingers
are
all
thumbs
he
said
your
thumbs
then
you
do
suppose
i
mind
there
was
meaning
in
her
voice
and
waddington
conceived
himself
to
be
on
the
verge
of
the
first
exquisite
intimacies
of
love
he
left
off
thinking
about
fanny
he
poured
out
tea
and
handed
bread
and
butter
in
a
happy
dream
he
ate
and
drank
without
knowing
what
he
ate
and
drank
his
whole
consciousness
was
one
muzzy
heavy
sense
of
the
fullness
and
nearness
of
elise
he
could
feel
his
ears
go
and
his
voice
thicken
as
if
he
were
slightly
very
slightly
drunk
he
wondered
how
elise
could
go
on
eating
bread
and
butter
he
heard
himself
sigh
when
at
last
he
put
her
cup
down
he
considered
the
position
of
the
in
relation
to
the
sofa
it
hemmed
in
that
part
of
it
where
he
was
going
to
sit
very
cramping
he
moved
it
well
back
and
considered
it
again
it
now
stood
in
his
direct
line
of
retreat
from
the
sofa
to
the
armchair
an
obstruction
if
anybody
were
to
come
in
he
moved
it
to
one
side
that
better
he
said
now
we
can
get
a
clear
view
of
the
fire
it
is
too
much
for
you
elise
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
he
had
really
moved
the
because
of
the
fire
as
yet
he
had
no
purpose
and
no
plan
he
did
know
what
on
earth
he
was
going
to
say
to
elise
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
there
was
a
sudden
hushed
pause
elise
had
turned
round
in
her
seat
and
was
looking
at
him
her
eyes
were
steady
behind
the
light
tremor
of
their
lashes
brilliant
and
profound
he
reflected
that
her
one
weak
point
the
shortness
of
her
legs
was
not
noticeable
when
she
was
sitting
down
he
also
wondered
how
he
could
ever
have
thought
her
mouth
hard
it
moved
with
a
little
tender
sensitive
twitch
like
the
flutter
of
her
eyelids
and
he
conceived
that
she
was
drawn
to
him
and
held
trembling
by
his
fascination
she
spoke
first
waddington
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
about
the
rent
but
you
know
it
safe
do
you
of
course
i
know
it
do
talk
about
rent
do
think
about
it
i
ca
help
it
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
until
it
paid
i
rather
you
never
paid
any
rent
at
all
than
that
you
should
worry
about
it
like
this
i
did
ask
you
to
come
here
to
talk
business
elise
i
afraid
i
must
talk
it
just
a
little
not
now
he
said
firmly
i
wo
listen
it
sounded
exactly
as
if
he
said
he
would
listen
to
any
more
talk
about
rent
but
he
thought
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
if
she
begins
about
that
five
hundred
but
she
hardly
can
after
that
anyhow
i
shall
decline
to
discuss
it
tell
me
what
you
been
doing
with
yourself
you
ca
much
with
yourself
in
wyck
i
trot
about
my
house
my
dear
little
house
that
you
made
so
nice
for
me
i
do
my
marketing
and
i
go
out
to
tea
with
the
parson
wife
or
the
doctor
wife
or
bostock
or
mrs
grainger
i
did
know
you
went
to
the
graingers
he
thought
that
was
not
very
loyal
of
elise
you
must
go
somewhere
well
and
in
the
evenings
we
play
bridge
who
plays
bridge
hawtrey
or
thurston
or
young
hawtrey
and
toby
and
major
markham
and
me
always
major
markham
well
he
comes
a
good
deal
he
likes
coming
he
do
you
mind
i
should
mind
very
much
if
i
thought
it
would
make
any
difference
any
difference
she
frowned
and
blinked
as
though
she
were
trying
hard
to
see
what
he
meant
what
he
possibly
mean
by
that
difference
she
said
to
what
to
you
and
me
of
course
it
does
not
a
scrap
how
could
it
no
how
could
it
i
do
really
believe
it
could
but
why
should
it
she
persisted
why
indeed
ours
is
a
wonderful
relation
a
unique
relation
and
i
think
you
want
as
much
as
i
do
to
to
keep
it
intact
of
course
i
want
to
keep
it
intact
i
would
for
worlds
let
anything
come
between
us
certainly
not
bridge
she
meditated
i
suppose
i
do
play
rather
a
lot
there
nothing
else
to
do
you
see
and
you
get
carried
away
i
hope
my
dear
you
do
play
for
money
oh
well
it
is
much
fun
for
the
others
if
we
do
you
do
play
high
i
hope
what
do
you
call
high
well
breaking
into
pound
notes
pound
notes
penny
points
well
ten
shillings
is
the
very
highest
stake
when
we
reckless
and
going
it
besides
i
always
play
against
markham
and
hawtrey
because
i
know
wo
be
hard
on
me
if
i
lose
now
what
i
do
like
i
a
thousand
times
rather
pay
your
gambling
debts
than
have
you
putting
yourself
under
an
obligation
to
those
men
he
could
bear
it
he
could
bear
to
think
that
elise
could
bear
it
you
should
have
come
to
me
he
said
i
have
come
to
you
have
i
she
thought
of
the
five
hundred
pounds
he
thought
of
them
too
ah
that
different
now
about
these
debts
to
markham
and
hawtrey
how
much
do
they
come
to
about
oh
a
note
would
cover
all
of
it
but
i
shall
only
be
in
debt
to
you
we
say
nothing
about
that
if
i
pay
it
elise
will
you
promise
me
you
never
play
higher
than
penny
points
again
it
too
angelic
of
you
really
he
smiled
he
liked
paying
her
gambling
debts
he
liked
the
power
it
gave
him
over
her
he
liked
to
think
that
he
could
make
her
promise
he
liked
to
be
told
he
was
angelic
it
was
all
very
cheap
at
five
pounds
and
it
would
enable
him
to
refuse
the
five
hundred
with
a
better
grace
come
on
your
word
of
honour
only
penny
points
on
my
word
of
honour
but
oh
i
do
think
i
can
take
it
she
thought
of
the
five
hundred
when
you
wanted
five
hundred
it
was
pretty
rotten
to
be
put
off
with
a
fiver
if
you
can
take
it
from
hawtrey
and
markham
that
it
i
take
it
from
markham
i
have
done
that
i
do
it
well
hawtrey
then
hawtrey
different
why
is
he
different
a
faint
suspicion
relating
to
markham
troubled
him
and
not
for
the
first
time
well
you
see
he
a
married
man
he
might
be
my
uncle
he
thought
and
markham
might
be
but
elise
was
not
in
love
with
the
fellow
no
no
he
was
sure
of
elise
he
knew
the
symptoms
you
could
mistake
them
but
she
might
marry
markham
all
the
same
out
of
boredom
out
of
uncertainty
out
of
desperation
he
was
not
going
to
let
that
happen
he
would
make
it
impossible
he
would
give
elise
the
certainty
she
wanted
now
you
said
was
different
playful
reproach
but
she
would
understand
so
you
are
you
a
married
man
too
are
you
i
thought
we
agreed
to
forget
it
forget
it
forget
mrs
waddington
yes
forget
her
you
knew
me
long
before
you
knew
fanny
what
has
she
got
to
do
with
you
and
me
just
this
that
she
the
only
woman
in
the
county
who
know
because
you
my
friend
elise
you
need
remind
me
i
not
likely
to
forget
that
any
good
thing
that
come
to
me
here
has
come
through
you
i
do
want
anything
but
good
to
come
to
you
through
me
he
leaned
forward
you
not
very
happy
in
wyck
are
you
happy
oh
yes
but
it
not
what
you
call
wildly
exciting
and
toby
worrying
me
he
says
he
ca
stand
it
and
he
wants
to
emigrate
well
why
not
waddington
heart
gave
a
great
thump
of
hope
he
saw
it
all
clearly
toby
was
the
great
obstruction
elise
might
have
held
out
for
ever
as
long
as
toby
lived
with
her
but
if
toby
went
she
saw
it
too
that
was
why
she
consented
to
his
going
it
is
much
of
a
job
for
him
bostock
bank
she
assented
i
told
him
he
can
go
if
he
can
get
anything
he
played
stroking
the
long
tails
of
her
fur
it
lay
between
them
like
a
soft
supine
animal
would
you
like
to
live
in
cheltenham
elise
cheltenham
if
i
took
a
little
house
for
you
he
had
calculated
that
he
might
just
as
well
lose
his
rent
in
cheltenham
as
in
wyck
better
besides
he
need
lose
it
he
could
let
the
white
house
it
would
partly
pay
for
cheltenham
one
of
those
little
houses
in
montpelier
place
it
too
sweet
of
you
to
think
of
it
she
began
playing
too
stroking
the
fur
animal
their
hands
played
together
over
the
sleek
softness
consciously
shyly
without
touching
but
why
cheltenham
cheltenham
is
wyck
no
but
it
just
as
dull
and
stuffy
stuffier
beautiful
little
town
elise
what
the
good
of
that
when
it
crammed
full
of
school
children
and
school
teachers
and
decayed
army
people
and
old
maids
i
do
anybody
in
cheltenham
ca
you
see
that
that
would
be
the
advantage
no
i
ca
see
it
there
only
one
place
i
to
live
in
and
that
is
london
and
i
ca
why
not
after
all
london
was
not
such
a
bad
idea
he
had
thought
of
it
before
now
himself
well
i
do
know
whether
i
told
you
that
i
not
on
very
good
terms
with
my
husband
people
they
have
been
at
all
nice
to
me
since
poor
frank
death
poor
elise
they
live
in
london
and
they
want
to
keep
me
out
of
it
my
gives
me
a
small
allowance
on
condition
i
do
live
there
they
hate
me
she
said
smiling
as
much
as
all
that
is
it
a
large
allowance
no
it
a
very
small
one
but
they
know
i
ca
get
on
without
it
you
ought
not
to
be
dependent
on
such
people
perhaps
in
a
flat
or
one
of
those
little
houses
in
john
wood
it
would
be
too
heavenly
but
what
the
good
of
talking
about
it
you
must
know
what
i
want
to
do
for
you
elise
i
want
to
make
you
happy
to
put
you
safe
above
all
these
wretched
worries
to
take
care
of
you
dear
you
let
me
wo
you
my
dear
waddington
my
dear
friend
the
dark
eyes
brightened
she
saw
a
clear
prospect
of
the
five
hundred
compared
with
what
old
waddy
was
proposing
such
a
sum
and
a
mere
loan
too
represented
moderation
the
moment
had
come
very
happily
for
reopening
this
question
i
ca
let
you
do
anything
so
so
extensive
really
and
truly
all
i
want
is
just
a
temporary
loan
if
you
really
could
lend
me
that
five
hundred
you
said
i
did
say
i
would
and
i
did
say
i
would
i
said
it
would
depend
i
know
but
you
never
said
on
what
if
the
securities
i
offered
you
are
good
enough
there
the
legacy
he
was
silent
he
knew
now
that
his
condition
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
securities
he
must
know
he
would
know
where
he
stood
my
aunt
said
elise
gently
is
very
old
i
would
dream
of
touching
your
poor
little
legacy
he
said
it
with
passion
wo
you
drop
all
this
sordid
talk
about
business
and
trust
me
i
do
trust
you
the
little
white
hand
left
off
stroking
the
dark
fur
and
reached
out
to
him
he
took
it
and
held
it
tight
it
struggled
to
withdraw
itself
you
are
afraid
of
me
he
said
no
but
i
afraid
of
partridge
coming
in
and
seeing
us
he
might
think
it
rather
odd
he
wo
come
in
it
does
matter
what
partridge
thinks
oh
it
he
wo
come
in
he
drew
a
little
closer
to
her
he
will
he
he
come
and
clear
away
the
things
i
hear
him
coming
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
of
the
to
the
further
door
and
looked
out
there
no
one
there
he
said
they
do
come
six
and
it
five
yet
elise
abstract
your
mind
one
moment
from
partridge
if
i
get
that
little
house
in
london
will
you
live
in
it
i
ca
let
you
you
make
me
ashamed
after
all
you
done
for
me
it
too
much
it
is
if
i
take
it
will
you
let
me
come
and
see
you
oh
yes
but
she
shrank
so
far
as
elise
could
be
said
to
shrink
a
little
further
back
into
her
corner
it
rather
far
from
wyck
he
said
still
i
could
run
up
once
in
he
became
pensive
in
three
weeks
or
so
for
the
day
i
should
be
delighted
no
for
the
day
he
was
irritated
with
this
artificial
obtuseness
for
the
for
the
week
sometimes
when
i
can
manage
it
i
shall
say
it
business
she
drew
back
and
back
as
if
from
his
advance
her
head
tilted
her
eyes
glinting
at
him
under
lowered
lids
taking
it
all
in
yet
pretending
a
paralysis
of
ignorance
she
wanted
to
see
to
see
how
far
he
would
go
before
she
she
wanted
him
to
think
she
did
understand
him
even
now
it
was
this
backward
gesture
that
excited
him
he
drew
himself
close
close
elise
it
no
use
pretending
you
know
what
i
mean
you
know
i
want
you
he
stooped
over
her
covering
her
with
his
great
chest
he
put
his
arms
round
her
in
my
arms
you
you
want
she
felt
his
mouth
pushed
out
to
her
mouth
as
it
retreated
trying
to
cover
it
to
press
down
she
gave
a
cry
oh
oh
you
and
struggled
beating
him
off
with
one
hand
while
the
other
fumbled
madly
for
her
his
grip
slackened
he
rose
to
his
feet
but
he
still
stooped
over
her
penning
her
in
with
his
outstretched
arms
his
weight
propped
by
his
hands
laid
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
you
old
imbecile
she
spurted
she
could
afford
it
in
one
rapid
flash
of
intelligence
she
had
seen
that
whatever
happened
she
could
never
get
that
five
hundred
pounds
and
to
surrender
to
old
waddy
without
it
to
surrender
to
old
waddy
at
all
when
she
could
marry
freddy
markham
would
be
too
preposterous
even
if
there
had
been
any
freddy
markham
it
would
have
been
preposterous
at
that
moment
as
she
said
it
while
he
still
held
her
prisoned
and
they
stared
into
each
other
faces
she
spurting
and
he
panting
barbara
came
in
he
started
jerked
himself
upright
levitt
recovered
herself
you
silly
cuckoo
she
said
you
do
know
how
ridiculous
you
look
she
had
found
her
and
was
dabbing
her
eyes
and
mouth
with
it
rubbing
off
the
uncleanness
of
his
impact
how
ridic
she
shook
with
laughter
barbara
pretended
not
to
see
them
to
have
gone
back
at
once
closing
the
door
on
them
would
have
been
to
admit
that
she
had
seen
them
instead
she
moved
quickly
yet
abstractedly
to
the
took
up
the
photographs
and
went
out
again
waddington
had
turned
away
and
stood
leaning
against
the
chimneypiece
hiding
his
head
poor
old
ostrich
in
his
hands
his
attitude
expressed
a
dignified
sorrow
and
a
wronged
integrity
barbara
stood
for
a
collected
instant
at
the
door
and
spoke
i
sorry
i
forgot
the
photographs
as
if
she
said
cheer
up
old
thing
i
did
really
see
you
through
the
closed
door
she
heard
levitt
laughter
let
loose
malignant
shrill
hysterical
a
horrid
sound
i
sorry
elise
but
i
thought
you
cared
for
me
you
no
business
to
think
and
it
was
likely
i
tell
you
oh
you
did
tell
me
my
dear
how
could
you
but
you
made
me
believe
you
wanted
me
wanted
do
you
suppose
i
wanted
to
be
made
ridiculous
love
is
ridiculous
said
waddington
it
is
it
most
ridiculous
thing
there
is
and
when
making
it
if
you
could
have
seen
your
face
oh
dear
if
you
would
laugh
quite
so
loud
the
servants
will
hear
you
i
mean
them
to
hear
me
confound
you
elise
that
right
swear
at
me
swear
at
me
i
sorry
i
swore
but
hang
it
all
it
every
bit
as
bad
for
me
as
it
is
for
you
worse
i
fancy
you
need
think
miss
madden
did
see
you
because
she
did
it
a
pity
miss
madden
did
come
in
a
little
sooner
sooner
i
think
she
chose
her
moment
very
well
if
she
had
heard
the
whole
of
our
conversation
i
think
she
have
realized
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
me
there
is
anything
to
be
said
for
you
and
until
you
apologized
for
insulting
me
you
heard
me
apologize
as
for
insulting
you
no
decent
woman
in
the
circumstances
ever
tells
a
man
his
love
insults
her
even
if
she
ca
return
it
and
even
if
he
another
woman
husband
even
if
he
another
woman
husband
if
she
ever
given
him
the
right
right
do
you
think
you
bought
the
right
to
make
love
to
me
she
rose
confronting
him
no
i
thought
you
given
it
me
i
was
mistaken
he
helped
her
to
put
on
the
coat
that
she
wriggled
into
with
clumsy
irritated
movements
clumsy
the
woman
clumsy
he
wondered
how
he
had
never
seen
it
and
vulgar
noisy
and
vulgar
you
never
knew
what
a
woman
was
like
till
you
seen
her
angry
he
had
answered
her
appropriately
and
with
admirable
tact
he
had
scored
every
point
he
was
scoring
now
with
his
cool
imperturbable
politeness
he
tried
not
to
think
about
barbara
your
fur
thank
you
he
rang
the
bell
partridge
appeared
tell
kimber
to
bring
the
car
round
and
drive
levitt
home
thank
you
waddington
i
rather
walk
partridge
retired
she
held
out
her
hand
waddington
bowed
abruptly
not
taking
it
he
strode
behind
her
to
the
door
through
the
to
the
further
door
in
the
hall
partridge
hovered
he
left
her
to
him
and
as
she
followed
partridge
across
the
wide
space
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
elise
in
her
agitation
waddled
like
a
duck
a
greedy
duck
like
that
horrible
sister
of
hers
bertha
rickards
then
he
thought
of
barbara
madden
when
ralph
called
for
barbara
he
told
her
first
thing
that
he
had
heard
from
mackintyres
the
publishers
about
his
book
he
had
sent
it
them
finished
and
grevill
burton
grevill
barbara
had
read
it
and
reported
very
favourably
mackintyres
had
agreed
to
publish
it
if
the
end
was
equal
to
the
beginning
and
the
middle
it
was
this
exciting
news
thrown
at
her
before
she
could
get
her
hat
on
that
had
caused
barbara
to
forget
all
about
photographs
and
waddington
book
and
waddington
until
she
and
ralph
were
half
way
between
and
lower
speed
there
was
nothing
for
it
then
but
to
go
on
taking
care
to
get
back
in
time
to
take
the
photographs
to
pyecraft
before
the
shop
closed
there
been
very
much
time
but
barbara
said
she
could
just
do
it
if
she
made
a
dash
and
it
was
the
dash
she
made
that
precipitated
her
into
the
scene
of
waddington
affair
ralph
waited
for
her
at
the
white
gate
we
must
sprint
she
said
if
we
to
be
in
time
they
sprinted
as
they
walked
slowly
back
barbara
became
thoughtful
as
long
as
she
lived
she
would
remember
waddington
the
arms
the
body
bowed
to
the
caress
the
inflamed
and
startled
face
staring
at
her
like
some
strange
fish
over
shoulder
the
mouth
dropping
open
as
if
it
called
out
to
her
go
back
what
depths
of
fatuity
he
must
have
sunk
to
before
he
could
have
come
to
that
and
the
sad
figure
leaning
on
the
chimneypiece
whipped
beaten
by
levitt
laughter
the
high
coarse
malignant
laughter
that
had
made
her
run
to
the
door
to
shield
him
to
shut
it
off
what
would
ralph
have
given
to
have
seen
him
it
was
all
very
well
for
ralph
to
talk
about
making
a
study
of
him
he
had
got
further
than
the
merest
outside
fringe
of
his
great
subject
he
did
know
the
bare
rudiments
of
waddington
he
had
had
brilliant
flashes
of
his
own
but
no
sure
sight
of
the
reality
and
it
had
been
given
to
her
barbara
to
see
it
all
at
once
she
had
penetrated
at
one
bound
into
the
thick
of
him
they
had
wondered
how
far
he
would
go
and
he
had
gone
so
far
so
incredibly
far
above
and
beyond
himself
that
all
their
estimates
were
falsified
and
she
saw
that
her
seeing
was
the
end
the
end
of
their
game
hers
and
ralph
the
end
of
their
compact
the
end
of
the
tie
that
bound
them
she
found
herself
shut
in
with
waddington
the
secret
that
she
shared
with
him
shut
ralph
out
it
was
intolerable
that
all
this
rich
exciting
material
should
be
left
on
her
hands
lodged
with
her
useless
when
she
thought
of
what
she
and
ralph
could
have
made
of
it
together
if
only
she
could
have
given
it
him
but
of
course
she
could
she
had
always
known
there
would
be
things
she
could
give
him
she
would
go
on
seeing
more
and
more
of
them
odd
that
she
did
feel
any
moral
indignation
it
had
been
too
funny
like
catching
a
child
in
some
amusing
naughtiness
and
as
poor
eyes
and
open
mouth
had
intimated
she
had
had
no
business
to
catch
him
to
know
anything
about
it
no
business
to
be
there
ralph
she
said
you
must
let
me
off
the
compact
he
turned
laughing
why
have
you
seen
something
it
does
matter
whether
i
have
or
have
it
was
a
sacred
compact
but
if
i
can
only
keep
it
by
being
a
perfect
pig
he
looked
down
at
her
face
her
troubled
unnaturally
earnest
face
of
course
if
you
feel
like
that
about
it
you
feel
like
that
if
you
were
his
confidential
secretary
and
had
all
his
correspondence
yes
yes
i
see
barbara
it
wo
work
i
let
you
off
the
compact
we
can
go
on
with
him
just
the
same
we
ca
what
not
make
a
study
of
him
no
we
do
know
what
we
doing
it
is
safe
we
may
come
on
things
any
day
like
the
thing
you
came
on
just
now
i
did
say
i
come
on
anything
all
right
you
did
he
shall
be
our
unfinished
book
barbara
he
be
unfinished
book
i
finished
mine
all
right
anything
else
will
be
simply
appendix
you
think
you
got
him
complete
fairly
complete
oh
barbara
do
tempt
me
ralph
after
all
he
said
we
were
only
playing
with
him
well
we
must
do
it
again
never
any
more
never
any
more
i
know
it
a
game
for
gods
but
it
a
cruel
game
we
must
give
it
up
you
mean
we
must
give
him
up
yes
we
hunted
and
hounded
him
enough
we
must
let
him
go
that
the
compact
is
it
yes
we
shall
break
it
barbara
see
if
we
do
we
ca
keep
off
him
waddington
judged
that
after
all
owing
to
his
consummate
tact
he
had
scored
in
the
disagreeable
parting
with
levitt
but
when
he
thought
of
barbara
little
barbara
a
flush
mounted
to
his
face
his
ears
his
forehead
he
could
feel
it
wave
after
wave
of
hot
unpleasant
shame
he
went
slowly
back
to
the
library
and
shut
himself
in
with
the
and
the
sofa
and
the
cushions
crushed
deeply
hollowed
with
the
large
pressure
of
elise
he
wondered
how
much
barbara
had
taken
in
at
what
precise
moment
she
had
appeared
he
tried
to
reconstruct
the
scene
he
had
been
leaning
over
elise
he
could
see
himself
leaning
over
her
enclosing
her
and
elise
head
stiffened
drawing
back
from
his
kiss
worse
than
the
sting
of
her
repugnance
was
the
thought
that
barbara
had
seen
it
and
his
attitude
his
really
very
compromising
attitude
had
she
had
she
the
door
now
it
was
at
right
angles
to
the
sofa
perhaps
barbara
had
caught
him
fair
he
went
to
the
door
and
came
in
from
it
to
make
certain
yes
yes
from
that
point
it
was
no
good
pretending
that
he
could
be
seen
but
barbara
had
rushed
in
like
a
little
whirlwind
and
she
had
gone
straight
to
the
turning
her
back
she
would
have
had
time
to
take
it
in
he
was
at
the
chimneypiece
before
she
had
turned
again
before
she
could
have
seen
him
he
must
have
recovered
himself
when
he
heard
her
coming
she
could
charge
in
like
that
without
being
heard
he
must
have
been
standing
up
well
apart
from
elise
not
leaning
over
her
by
the
time
barbara
came
in
he
tried
to
remember
what
barbara
had
said
when
she
went
out
she
had
said
something
he
could
remember
what
it
was
but
it
had
sounded
reassuring
now
surely
if
barbara
had
seen
anything
she
would
have
stopped
at
the
door
to
say
things
she
would
have
gone
straight
out
without
a
word
in
fact
she
would
have
come
in
at
all
she
would
have
drawn
back
the
very
instant
that
she
saw
she
would
simply
never
have
penetrated
as
far
as
the
he
remembered
how
coolly
she
had
taken
up
the
photographs
and
gone
out
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
probably
then
as
far
as
barbara
was
concerned
nothing
had
happened
then
he
remembered
the
horrible
laughing
of
elise
barbara
must
have
heard
that
she
must
have
wondered
she
might
just
have
caught
him
with
the
tail
of
her
eye
not
enough
to
swear
by
but
enough
to
wonder
and
afterwards
she
would
have
put
that
and
that
together
and
he
would
have
to
dine
with
her
alone
that
evening
to
face
her
young
clear
candid
eyes
he
did
know
how
he
was
going
to
get
through
with
it
and
yet
he
did
get
through
to
begin
with
barbara
was
very
late
for
dinner
she
had
thought
of
being
late
as
a
way
of
letting
waddington
down
easily
she
would
come
in
smiling
and
apologetic
palpably
in
the
wrong
having
kept
him
waiting
and
he
would
be
gracious
and
forgive
her
and
his
graciousnees
and
forgiveness
would
help
to
reinstate
him
he
would
need
she
reflected
a
lot
of
reinstating
barbara
considered
that
in
the
matter
of
punishment
he
had
had
enough
levitt
with
her
you
old
imbecile
had
done
to
him
all
and
more
than
all
that
justice
could
require
there
was
a
point
of
humiliation
beyond
which
no
human
creature
should
be
asked
to
suffer
to
be
caught
making
love
to
levitt
and
being
called
an
old
imbecile
and
then
to
be
pelted
with
indecent
laughter
and
in
any
case
it
was
not
her
barbara
place
to
punish
him
or
judge
him
she
had
had
no
business
to
catch
him
no
business
in
the
first
instance
to
forget
the
photographs
therefore
as
she
really
wanted
him
not
to
know
that
she
had
caught
him
she
went
on
behaving
as
if
nothing
had
happened
all
through
dinner
she
turned
the
conversation
on
to
topics
that
would
put
him
in
a
favourable
or
interesting
light
she
avoided
the
subject
of
fanny
she
asked
him
all
sorts
of
questions
about
his
war
work
tell
me
she
said
some
of
the
things
you
did
when
you
were
a
special
constable
and
he
told
her
his
great
story
to
be
sure
she
knew
the
best
part
of
it
already
because
ralph
had
told
it
it
had
been
one
of
his
scores
over
her
but
she
wanted
him
to
remember
it
she
judged
that
it
was
precisely
the
sort
of
memory
that
would
reinstate
him
faster
than
anything
for
really
he
had
played
a
considerable
part
well
you
could
see
by
his
face
that
he
was
gratified
one
of
the
things
we
had
to
do
was
to
drive
about
the
villages
and
farms
after
dark
to
see
that
there
were
any
lights
showing
it
was
nineteen
yes
in
the
winter
must
have
been
winter
because
i
was
wearing
my
british
warm
with
the
fur
collar
and
there
was
a
regular
scare
on
air
raids
no
tramps
we
been
fairly
terrorized
by
a
nasty
dangerous
sort
of
tramp
the
police
were
looking
for
two
of
these
fellows
discharged
soldiers
we
a
warrant
out
for
their
arrest
robbery
and
assault
with
violence
well
you
may
call
it
violence
one
of
had
thrown
a
pint
pot
at
the
landlord
of
the
king
head
and
hurt
him
and
they
bolted
with
two
bottles
of
beer
and
a
tin
of
player
navy
cut
they
made
off
goodness
knows
where
we
could
find
i
was
driving
to
daunton
on
a
very
nasty
night
you
know
how
beastly
dark
it
is
between
the
woods
at
byford
park
well
i
just
got
there
when
i
passed
two
fellows
skulking
along
under
the
wall
they
stood
back
it
was
rather
a
near
shave
with
no
proper
lights
on
and
i
flashed
my
electric
torch
full
on
them
blest
if
they
were
the
very
chaps
we
were
looking
for
and
i
got
to
run
in
somehow
all
by
myself
and
two
to
one
it
was
any
joke
i
can
tell
you
goodness
knows
what
nasty
knives
and
things
they
might
have
had
on
what
you
do
do
i
drove
on
fifty
yards
ahead
and
pulled
up
the
car
outside
the
porter
lodge
at
byford
then
i
got
out
and
came
on
and
met
they
were
trying
to
bolt
into
the
wood
when
i
turned
my
torch
on
them
again
and
shouted
in
a
parade
voice
they
halted
hands
up
to
the
salute
i
thought
the
habit
would
be
too
much
for
when
they
heard
the
word
of
command
i
said
got
to
come
along
with
me
i
did
know
how
on
earth
i
was
going
to
take
them
if
they
would
go
and
they
started
dodging
so
i
tried
it
on
again
regular
parade
stunt
and
they
halted
again
all
right
then
i
harangued
them
i
said
you
blighters
i
a
special
constable
and
i
got
a
warrant
here
for
your
arrest
i
had
i
nothing
but
an
inland
revenue
income
tax
form
but
i
whipped
it
out
of
my
breast
pocket
and
trained
my
light
on
the
royal
arms
at
the
top
that
was
enough
for
then
i
shouted
again
in
my
parade
voice
about
face
quick
march
and
i
got
them
marching
i
marched
them
the
two
miles
from
byford
through
lower
speed
and
up
the
hill
to
wyck
and
into
the
police
station
and
we
ran
in
for
robbery
and
assault
it
was
clever
of
you
no
nothing
but
presence
of
mind
and
bluff
and
showing
that
you
were
going
to
stand
any
nonsense
but
i
do
suppose
corbett
or
hawtrey
or
any
of
those
chaps
would
have
thought
of
it
barbara
wondered
supposing
i
were
to
turn
on
him
and
say
old
humbug
you
know
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
you
know
you
did
march
them
a
hundred
yards
or
saw
you
this
afternoon
what
would
he
look
like
it
was
inconceivable
that
she
should
say
these
things
if
she
was
to
go
on
with
her
study
of
him
alone
she
would
go
on
in
the
spirit
they
had
begun
in
she
and
ralph
that
spirit
admitted
nothing
but
boundless
amusement
boundless
joy
in
him
moral
indignation
would
have
been
a
false
note
it
would
have
been
downright
irreverence
towards
the
god
who
made
him
what
if
he
did
omit
to
mention
that
the
nasty
dangerous
fellows
turned
out
to
be
two
feeble
youths
half
imbecile
with
and
half
drunk
and
that
it
was
hawtrey
arriving
opportunely
in
his
car
who
took
them
over
the
last
mile
to
the
police
station
as
it
happened
waddington
had
frankly
forgotten
these
details
as
inessential
to
his
story
he
marched
them
a
mile
after
telling
it
he
was
so
far
in
his
own
esteem
as
to
propose
their
working
together
on
the
ramblings
after
dinner
he
even
ordered
coffee
to
be
served
in
the
library
as
if
nothing
had
happened
there
unfortunately
by
some
culpable
oversight
of
annie
trinder
the
cushions
still
bore
the
imprint
of
elise
awful
realization
came
to
him
when
barbara
with
a
glance
at
the
sofa
declined
to
sit
on
it
he
had
turned
just
in
time
to
catch
the
flick
of
what
in
a
bantering
mood
he
had
once
called
her
barbaric
smile
after
all
she
might
have
seen
something
not
levitt
laughter
but
the
thought
of
what
barbara
might
have
seen
was
his
punishment
that
and
being
alone
with
her
knowing
that
she
knew
all
this
happened
on
a
wednesday
and
fanny
would
be
back
before
saturday
he
had
three
whole
days
to
be
alone
with
barbara
he
had
thought
that
no
punishment
could
be
worse
than
that
but
as
the
three
days
passed
and
barbara
continued
to
behave
as
though
nothing
had
happened
he
got
used
to
it
it
was
on
a
friday
night
as
he
lay
awake
reviewing
for
the
hundredth
time
the
situation
that
his
conscience
pointed
out
to
him
how
he
really
stood
there
was
a
worse
punishment
than
barbara
knowing
if
fanny
knew
there
were
all
sorts
of
ways
in
which
she
might
get
to
know
barbara
might
tell
her
the
two
were
as
thick
as
thieves
and
if
the
child
turned
jealous
and
hysterical
she
had
never
liked
elise
or
she
might
tell
ralph
bevan
and
he
might
tell
fanny
or
he
might
tell
somebody
who
would
tell
her
there
were
always
plenty
of
people
about
who
considered
it
their
duty
to
report
these
things
of
course
if
he
threw
himself
on
barbara
mercy
and
exacted
a
promise
from
her
not
to
tell
he
knew
she
would
keep
it
but
supposing
all
the
time
she
had
seen
or
suspected
anything
supposing
her
calm
manner
came
from
a
mind
innocent
of
all
seeing
and
suspecting
then
he
would
have
given
himself
away
for
nothing
besides
even
if
barbara
never
said
anything
there
was
elise
no
knowing
what
elise
might
do
or
say
in
her
vulgar
fury
she
might
tell
toby
or
markham
and
the
two
might
make
themselves
damnably
unpleasant
the
story
would
be
all
over
the
county
in
no
time
and
there
were
the
servants
supposing
one
of
the
women
took
it
into
her
head
to
give
notice
on
account
of
goings
on
he
could
live
in
peace
so
long
as
all
or
any
of
these
things
were
possible
the
only
thing
was
to
be
beforehand
with
barbara
and
bevan
and
elise
and
toby
and
markham
and
the
servants
to
tell
fanny
himself
before
any
of
them
could
get
in
first
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
he
was
persuaded
that
this
was
the
only
right
the
only
straightforward
and
manly
thing
to
do
at
the
same
time
it
occurred
to
him
that
by
suppressing
a
few
unimportant
details
he
could
really
give
a
very
satisfactory
account
of
the
whole
affair
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
instance
to
tell
fanny
what
his
intentions
had
been
if
indeed
he
had
ever
had
any
for
as
he
went
again
and
again
over
the
whole
stupid
business
his
intentions
those
that
related
to
the
little
house
in
cheltenham
or
john
wood
tended
to
sink
back
into
the
dream
state
from
which
they
had
arisen
clearing
his
conscience
more
and
more
from
any
actual
offence
he
had
in
fact
nothing
to
account
for
but
his
attitude
the
rather
compromising
attitude
in
which
barbara
had
found
him
and
that
could
be
very
easily
explained
away
fanny
was
not
one
of
those
exacting
jealous
women
she
would
be
ready
to
accept
a
reasonable
explanation
of
anything
and
you
could
always
appease
her
by
a
little
attention
so
on
friday
afternoon
waddington
himself
drove
the
car
down
to
wyck
station
and
met
fanny
on
the
platform
he
made
tea
for
her
himself
and
waited
on
her
moving
assiduously
and
smiling
an
affectionate
yet
rather
conscious
smile
he
was
impelled
to
these
acts
spontaneously
because
of
that
gentleness
and
tenderness
towards
fanny
which
the
bare
thought
of
elise
was
always
enough
to
inspire
him
with
thus
by
sticking
close
to
fanny
all
the
evening
he
contrived
that
barbara
should
have
no
opportunity
of
saying
anything
to
her
and
in
the
last
hour
before
when
they
were
alone
together
in
the
he
began
he
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
barbara
and
came
back
to
his
place
scowling
like
one
overpowered
by
anxious
thought
he
exaggerated
this
expression
on
purpose
so
that
fanny
should
notice
it
and
give
him
his
opening
which
she
did
well
old
thing
what
are
looking
so
glum
about
do
i
look
glum
dismal
what
is
it
he
stood
upright
before
the
chinmeypiece
his
conscience
sustained
by
this
posture
of
rectitude
i
not
quite
easy
about
barbara
he
said
barbara
what
on
earth
has
been
doing
she
been
doing
nothing
it
it
rather
what
she
may
do
if
you
do
stop
her
i
do
want
to
stop
her
said
fanny
if
you
thinking
of
ralph
bevan
ralph
bevan
i
certainly
am
not
thinking
of
him
neither
is
she
well
then
what
i
was
thinking
of
myself
my
dear
you
surely
do
imagine
that
barbara
thinking
of
you
not
not
in
the
way
you
imply
the
fact
is
i
was
let
in
for
a
a
rather
unpleasant
scene
the
other
day
with
mrs
levitt
i
always
thought
said
fanny
that
woman
would
let
you
in
for
something
well
well
i
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
about
it
my
dear
why
was
it
as
bad
as
all
that
perhaps
i
better
not
know
i
want
you
to
know
i
trying
to
tell
you
because
of
barbara
i
ca
see
where
barbara
comes
in
she
came
into
the
library
while
it
was
happening
fanny
laughed
and
it
disconcerted
him
while
what
was
happening
she
said
you
better
tell
me
straight
out
i
do
suppose
it
was
anything
like
as
bad
as
you
think
it
was
i
only
afraid
of
what
barbara
might
think
oh
you
can
trust
barbara
not
to
think
things
she
never
does
dear
fanny
he
would
have
found
his
job
of
explaining
atrociously
difficult
with
any
other
woman
any
other
woman
would
have
entangled
him
tighter
and
tighter
but
he
could
see
that
fanny
was
trying
to
get
it
straight
to
help
him
out
with
all
his
honour
and
and
dignity
intact
every
turn
she
gave
to
the
conversation
favoured
him
my
dear
i
afraid
she
saw
something
that
i
must
say
was
open
to
misinterpretation
it
was
my
fault
but
no
the
better
he
remembered
it
the
more
clearly
he
saw
it
was
fault
not
his
and
he
could
see
that
fanny
thought
it
was
fault
this
suggested
the
next
step
in
the
course
that
was
only
not
perjury
because
it
was
so
purely
instinctive
the
subterfuge
of
terrified
vanity
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
no
plan
that
he
followed
fanny
upon
my
word
i
tell
you
straight
out
fanny
only
i
do
like
to
give
the
poor
woman
away
mrs
levitt
said
fanny
you
need
mind
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
she
give
away
if
you
do
she
was
giving
him
a
clear
lead
when
he
began
he
had
really
had
some
thoughts
of
owning
somewhere
about
this
point
that
he
had
lost
his
head
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
he
saw
that
this
admission
was
unnecessarily
quixotic
and
that
he
would
be
far
safer
if
he
suggested
that
elise
had
lost
hers
in
fact
it
was
fanny
who
had
suggested
it
in
the
first
place
it
might
not
be
altogether
a
fair
imputation
but
hang
it
all
it
was
the
only
one
that
would
really
appease
fanny
and
he
had
fanny
to
think
of
and
not
elise
he
owed
it
her
for
her
sake
he
must
give
up
the
personal
luxury
of
truthtelling
the
thing
would
go
no
further
with
fanny
and
it
was
only
what
fanny
had
believed
herself
in
any
case
and
always
would
believe
elise
would
be
no
worse
off
as
far
as
fanny
was
concerned
so
he
fairly
let
himself
go
there
no
knowing
what
she
may
do
he
said
she
was
in
a
thoroughly
hysterical
state
she
come
to
me
with
her
usual
troubles
not
able
to
pay
her
rent
and
so
on
and
in
talking
she
became
very
much
upset
and
er
er
lost
her
head
and
took
me
completely
by
surprise
that
he
thought
she
certainly
did
you
mean
you
lost
yours
too
said
fanny
mildly
i
did
nothing
of
the
sort
but
i
was
rather
alarmed
before
you
could
say
she
gone
off
into
a
violent
fit
of
hysterics
and
i
was
just
trying
to
bring
her
round
when
barbara
came
in
his
explanation
was
so
much
more
plausible
than
the
reality
that
he
almost
believed
it
himself
i
think
he
said
pensively
she
have
seen
me
bending
over
her
and
she
did
offer
to
help
no
she
rushed
in
and
she
rushed
out
again
she
may
not
have
seen
anything
but
in
case
she
did
i
wish
my
dear
you
explain
i
think
i
better
not
said
fanny
in
case
she
did
no
but
it
worries
me
every
time
i
think
of
it
she
came
right
into
the
room
besides
he
said
we
got
to
think
of
mrs
levitt
mrs
levitt
yes
put
yourself
in
her
place
she
would
like
it
supposed
that
i
was
making
love
to
her
she
might
consider
the
whole
thing
made
her
look
as
ridiculous
as
it
made
me
i
forgotten
levitt
point
of
view
you
rather
gave
me
to
understand
that
was
what
she
wanted
i
never
said
anything
of
the
sort
seeing
that
the
explanation
was
going
so
well
he
could
afford
to
be
magnanimous
i
must
have
imagined
it
said
fanny
she
recovered
i
suppose
and
you
got
rid
of
her
yes
i
got
rid
of
her
all
right
well
said
fanny
gathering
herself
up
to
go
to
bed
i
worry
any
more
about
it
i
make
it
straight
with
barbara
she
went
up
to
barbara
bedroom
where
barbara
still
dressed
sat
reading
over
the
fire
come
in
you
darling
barbara
said
she
got
up
and
crouched
on
the
hearthrug
leaving
her
chair
for
fanny
fanny
came
in
and
sat
down
barbara
she
said
what
all
this
about
horatio
and
mrs
levitt
i
do
know
said
barbara
flatly
with
sudden
presence
of
mind
i
said
you
did
but
the
poor
old
thing
goes
on
and
on
about
it
he
thinks
you
saw
something
the
other
day
something
you
did
understand
did
you
barbara
said
nothing
she
stared
away
from
fanny
did
you
of
course
i
did
of
course
you
did
he
says
you
must
have
seen
and
it
worrying
him
no
end
i
saw
something
but
he
need
worry
i
understood
all
right
what
did
you
see
nothing
nothing
that
mattered
it
matters
most
awfully
to
me
i
do
think
it
need
said
barbara
but
it
in
a
sense
i
do
mind
what
he
does
and
in
a
sense
i
do
i
still
care
enough
for
that
i
do
think
there
was
anything
you
need
mind
so
awfully
yes
but
there
something
he
said
there
was
he
was
afraid
misunderstand
it
he
said
he
was
bending
over
her
when
you
came
in
well
he
bending
a
bit
what
was
doing
she
was
laughing
in
hysterics
she
saw
it
all
i
suppose
you
might
call
it
hysterics
they
were
nice
hysterics
though
she
is
a
nice
woman
no
but
he
was
making
love
to
her
and
she
was
laughing
at
him
she
was
nice
enough
for
that
if
that
nice
why
what
else
could
the
poor
woman
do
if
she
honest
oh
she
honest
enough
in
way
said
barbara
and
he
could
see
it
he
so
intent
on
his
own
beautiful
postlethwaite
nose
he
ca
see
anything
that
goes
on
under
it
still
honest
or
not
honest
she
a
beast
barbara
when
they
been
such
pals
and
he
helped
her
to
have
gone
and
rounded
on
the
poor
thing
like
that
she
might
just
as
well
have
pulled
his
postlethwaite
nose
it
could
have
hurt
more
oh
i
think
he
get
over
it
i
mean
it
could
have
hurt
more
she
a
beast
said
barbara
i
bet
you
anything
you
like
it
her
fault
she
drove
him
to
it
no
barbara
it
was
fault
drove
him
i
always
laughing
at
him
and
he
ca
bear
being
laughed
at
it
makes
him
feel
all
stuffy
and
he
only
goes
in
for
passion
because
it
makes
him
feel
young
it
is
really
passion
said
barbara
no
you
wise
thing
it
is
if
it
was
i
could
forgive
him
i
could
forgive
it
if
he
really
felt
young
it
this
ghastly
affectation
i
ca
stand
but
it
my
fault
barbara
my
fault
i
should
have
kept
him
young
they
sat
silent
barbara
at
fanny
feet
presently
fanny
drew
the
girl
head
down
into
her
lap
you
never
be
old
barbara
she
said
and
ralph
wo
what
made
you
think
of
ralph
fanny
horatio
of
course
xii
if
any
rumour
circulated
round
sooner
or
later
it
was
bound
to
reach
the
old
lady
at
the
dower
house
the
dower
house
was
the
redistributing
centre
for
the
news
of
the
district
thus
waddington
heard
that
levitt
was
talking
about
letting
the
white
house
furnished
that
she
was
in
debt
to
all
the
tradesmen
in
the
place
that
her
rent
at
trinder
was
still
owing
that
her
losses
at
bridge
were
never
paid
for
he
heard
that
if
major
markham
had
been
thinking
of
levitt
he
had
changed
his
mind
there
was
even
a
definite
rumour
about
a
broken
engagement
anyhow
major
markham
was
now
paying
unmistakable
attentions
to
the
youngest
miss
hawtrey
of
medlicott
but
as
engagement
or
no
engagement
his
attentions
to
levitt
had
been
unmistakable
too
their
rupture
required
some
explanation
it
was
supposed
that
the
letter
which
the
major
mother
old
markham
of
medlicott
received
from
her
daughter
dick
benham
of
tunbridge
wells
did
very
thoroughly
explain
it
there
had
been
things
in
that
letter
which
markham
had
not
been
able
to
repeat
but
you
gathered
from
her
singular
reticence
that
they
had
something
to
do
with
dick
benham
and
levitt
and
that
they
showed
conclusively
that
elise
was
not
what
old
waddington
called
a
nice
woman
they
say
she
led
frank
levitt
an
awful
life
the
benhams
my
dear
wo
have
her
in
the
house
but
all
this
was
trivial
compared
with
the
correspondence
that
now
passed
between
waddington
and
elise
he
admitted
now
that
old
corbett
had
known
what
he
was
talking
about
when
he
had
warned
him
that
he
would
be
landed
landed
if
he
did
take
care
to
the
tune
of
five
hundred
and
pounds
his
letters
to
levitt
dictated
to
barbara
madden
revealed
the
care
he
had
to
take
from
motives
which
appeared
to
him
chivalrous
he
had
refrained
from
showing
barbara
levitt
letters
to
him
he
left
her
to
gather
their
crude
substance
from
his
admirable
replies
dear
levitt
am
afraid
i
must
advise
you
to
give
up
the
scheme
if
it
depends
on
my
i
thought
i
had
defined
my
position
defined
my
position
is
good
i
think
it
sounds
good
said
barbara
position
remains
what
it
was
and
as
your
exceptionally
fine
intelligence
can
not
fail
to
understand
it
no
more
need
be
said
least
i
hope
it
is
so
i
should
be
sorry
if
our
very
pleasant
relations
terminated
in
disappointment
for
one
instant
she
could
see
him
smile
feeling
voluptuously
the
sharp
bright
edge
of
his
word
before
it
cut
him
he
drew
back
scowling
above
a
sudden
sombre
flush
of
memory
disappointment
said
barbara
giving
him
his
cue
disappointment
is
not
quite
the
word
i
want
something
something
more
chivalrous
his
eyes
turned
away
from
her
pretending
to
look
for
it
ah
now
i
have
it
pleasant
relations
terminated
on
a
note
on
a
note
of
on
an
unexpected
note
kind
regards
very
sincerely
yours
bysshe
waddington
you
will
see
barbara
that
i
am
saying
precisely
the
same
thing
but
saying
it
inoffensively
as
a
gentleman
should
hours
later
he
dictated
levitt
i
have
no
suggestion
to
make
except
that
you
curtail
your
very
considerable
expenditure
for
the
rest
believe
me
it
is
as
disagreeable
for
me
to
be
obliged
to
refuse
your
request
as
i
am
sure
it
must
be
for
you
to
make
it
h
rest
request
that
wo
do
disagreeable
for
me
to
have
to
refuse
as
it
must
be
for
you
to
ask
simpler
that
never
use
an
elaborate
phrase
where
a
simple
one
will
do
are
good
enough
to
say
i
have
done
so
much
for
you
in
the
past
i
have
done
what
i
could
but
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
say
there
is
a
limit
beyond
which
i
can
not
go
yours
b
waddington
i
sent
her
a
cheque
for
pounds
already
that
ought
to
have
settled
her
settled
her
you
do
mean
to
say
you
sent
her
a
i
did
you
ought
to
have
sent
her
anything
at
all
but
i
promised
it
barbara
i
do
care
you
ought
to
have
waited
i
wanted
to
close
the
account
and
have
done
with
her
that
is
the
way
to
close
it
sending
cheques
that
cheque
will
have
to
go
through
parson
bank
supposing
toby
sees
it
what
if
he
does
he
might
object
he
might
even
make
a
row
about
it
what
could
i
do
i
had
to
pay
her
you
could
have
made
the
cheque
payable
to
me
it
would
have
passed
as
my
quarter
salary
i
could
have
cashed
it
and
you
could
have
given
her
notes
and
if
toby
remembered
their
numbers
you
could
have
changed
them
for
ten
shilling
notes
in
cheltenham
all
these
elaborate
precautions
you
ca
be
too
precautions
when
you
dealing
with
a
woman
like
that
is
this
all
you
given
her
all
yes
did
you
ever
give
her
anything
any
other
time
well
possibly
from
time
to
time
have
you
any
idea
of
the
total
amount
i
ca
say
and
i
ca
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
it
it
has
everything
to
do
with
it
can
you
find
out
certainly
if
i
look
up
my
old
cheque
books
you
better
do
that
now
he
turned
gloomily
to
his
the
cheque
books
for
the
current
year
and
the
year
before
it
betrayed
various
small
loans
to
levitt
amounting
in
all
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
odd
oh
dear
said
barbara
all
that
down
against
you
still
it
all
what
a
pity
you
did
pay
her
that
before
your
interview
how
do
you
mean
it
pretty
certain
she
misinterpreted
your
paying
it
now
so
soon
after
the
interview
do
you
really
think
she
misunderstood
me
barbara
i
think
she
wants
you
to
think
she
did
you
think
she
trying
trying
to
to
sell
you
her
silence
yes
i
do
good
god
i
never
thought
of
that
blackmail
i
do
suppose
for
a
minute
she
thinks
she
blackmailing
you
just
trying
it
on
and
she
may
raise
her
price
too
she
wo
rest
till
she
got
that
five
hundred
out
of
you
levitt
next
communication
would
appear
to
have
supported
barbara
suspicion
for
waddington
was
compelled
to
answer
it
thus
dear
levitt
you
say
you
were
then
and
that
my
were
you
could
tell
where
the
inverted
commas
came
by
the
biting
clip
of
his
tone
i
fail
to
appreciate
the
point
of
this
allusion
i
can
not
imagine
what
conditions
you
refer
to
i
made
none
as
for
promises
i
am
not
responsible
for
the
somewhat
restricted
interpretation
you
see
fit
to
put
on
a
friend
general
expressions
of
goodwill
yours
truly
horatio
bysshe
waddington
his
last
letter
a
day
later
never
got
as
far
as
its
signature
dear
madam
my
decision
will
not
be
affected
by
the
contingency
you
suggest
you
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
say
what
you
like
nobody
will
believe
you
that
i
think
is
as
far
as
i
can
go
much
too
far
said
barbara
and
that
taking
her
too
seriously
much
you
must
send
that
letter
why
not
because
it
gives
you
away
gives
me
away
it
seems
to
me
most
guarded
it
is
it
implies
that
there
things
she
might
say
even
if
you
do
mind
her
saying
them
you
must
put
it
in
writing
there
something
in
that
of
course
i
could
threaten
her
with
a
lawyer
letter
but
somehow
the
fact
is
barbara
if
you
a
decent
man
you
handicapped
in
dealing
with
a
lady
delicacy
there
are
things
that
could
be
said
material
things
most
material
to
the
case
but
i
ca
say
them
no
you
ca
say
them
but
i
can
i
think
i
could
stop
the
whole
thing
in
five
minutes
if
i
saw
levitt
will
you
leave
it
to
me
come
i
do
know
why
not
i
assure
you
it
be
all
right
well
perhaps
it
a
matter
of
business
a
pure
matter
of
business
it
certainly
is
that
there
no
reason
why
you
should
hand
it
over
to
your
secretary
he
hesitated
he
was
still
afraid
of
what
elise
might
say
to
barbara
you
will
understand
that
she
is
in
a
very
unbalanced
state
excitable
a
woman
in
that
state
is
apt
to
put
interpretations
on
the
most
innocent
er
acts
she
wo
be
able
to
put
on
any
after
i
done
with
her
if
it
comes
to
that
i
can
put
on
interpretations
too
waddington
then
at
barbara
dictation
wrote
a
short
note
to
levitt
inviting
her
to
call
and
see
him
that
afternoon
at
three
at
three
barbara
was
ready
for
her
she
had
assumed
for
the
occasion
her
war
office
manner
that
firm
sweetness
with
which
she
used
to
stand
between
importunate
interviewers
and
her
chief
it
had
made
her
the
joy
of
her
department
waddington
is
extremely
sorry
he
is
not
able
to
see
you
himself
he
is
engaged
with
his
agent
at
the
moment
waddington
had
indeed
created
that
engagement
engaged
but
i
have
an
appointment
yes
he
very
sorry
he
said
if
there
was
anything
i
could
do
for
you
thank
you
miss
madden
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
i
much
rather
see
waddington
himself
i
can
wait
i
would
advise
you
to
i
afraid
he
may
be
a
long
time
he
has
some
very
important
business
on
hand
just
now
business
said
levitt
is
very
important
oh
if
it
only
business
barbara
said
i
think
we
can
settle
it
at
once
i
had
most
of
the
correspondence
in
my
hands
and
i
think
i
know
all
the
circumstances
you
have
had
the
correspondence
in
your
hands
well
you
see
i
waddington
secretary
that
what
i
here
for
i
did
know
he
trusted
his
private
business
to
his
secretary
he
obliged
to
he
has
so
much
of
it
you
surely
do
expect
him
to
copy
out
his
own
letters
i
do
expect
him
to
hand
over
my
letters
to
other
people
to
read
i
have
read
your
letters
levitt
i
merely
taken
down
his
answers
to
copy
out
and
file
for
reference
then
my
dear
miss
madden
you
do
know
all
the
circumstances
at
any
rate
i
can
tell
you
what
waddington
intends
to
do
and
what
he
does
you
want
to
see
him
i
suppose
about
the
loan
for
the
investment
levitt
was
too
profoundly
disconcerted
to
reply
barbara
went
on
in
her
firm
sweetness
i
know
he
very
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
do
more
but
as
you
know
he
did
not
advise
the
investment
and
he
ca
possibly
advance
anything
for
it
beyond
the
fifty
pounds
he
has
already
paid
you
since
you
know
so
much
about
it
said
levitt
with
a
certain
calm
subdued
truculence
you
may
as
well
know
everything
you
are
quite
mistaken
in
supposing
that
waddington
did
not
advise
the
investment
on
the
contrary
it
was
on
his
representations
that
i
decided
to
invest
and
it
was
on
the
strength
of
the
security
he
offered
that
my
solicitors
advanced
me
the
money
he
is
responsible
for
the
whole
business
he
has
made
me
enter
into
engagements
that
i
can
not
meet
without
him
and
when
i
ask
him
to
fulfil
his
pledges
he
lets
me
down
i
do
think
waddington
knows
that
your
solicitors
advanced
the
money
there
is
no
reference
to
them
in
the
correspondence
i
think
if
you
look
through
your
or
if
waddington
will
look
through
his
you
find
you
are
mistaken
i
can
tell
waddington
what
you
told
me
and
let
you
know
what
he
says
if
you
do
mind
waiting
a
minute
i
can
let
you
know
now
she
sought
out
waddington
in
his
office
luckily
it
was
situated
in
the
kitchen
wing
the
one
farthest
from
the
library
she
found
him
alone
in
it
the
agent
had
gone
sitting
in
a
hard
windsor
chair
he
knew
that
elise
could
pursue
him
into
his
office
it
was
even
doubtful
whether
she
knew
where
it
was
he
had
retreated
into
it
as
into
some
impregnable
position
not
that
he
looked
safe
his
face
sagged
more
than
ever
as
though
the
postlethwaite
nose
had
withdrawn
its
support
from
that
pale
flesh
of
funk
if
it
had
any
clear
meaning
at
all
it
expressed
a
terrified
expectation
of
blackmail
his
very
moustache
and
hair
drooped
lamentably
are
you
disengaged
she
said
yes
but
for
god
sake
do
tell
her
that
it
all
right
she
knows
she
is
going
to
see
you
well
she
felt
the
queer
pathetic
clinging
of
his
mind
to
her
as
if
it
realized
that
she
held
his
honour
and
fanny
happiness
in
her
hands
she
not
going
to
give
up
that
five
hundred
without
a
struggle
the
deuce
she
is
on
what
grounds
does
she
claim
it
she
says
you
advised
her
to
make
a
certain
investment
and
that
you
promised
to
lend
her
half
the
sum
she
wanted
i
made
no
promise
i
said
that
sum
might
be
forthcoming
i
made
it
very
clear
that
it
would
depend
on
circumstances
on
circumstances
that
she
understood
knew
about
er
on
circumstances
that
no
she
did
know
about
them
still
you
made
conditions
no
i
made
a
mental
reservation
she
seems
to
be
aware
of
the
circumstances
that
influenced
you
she
thinks
you
gone
back
on
your
word
i
have
gone
back
on
nothing
my
word
sacred
the
woman
lies
she
sticks
to
it
that
the
promise
was
made
that
on
the
strength
of
it
she
invested
a
certain
sum
of
money
through
her
solicitors
that
they
advanced
the
money
on
that
security
and
you
advised
the
investment
i
did
not
advise
it
i
advised
her
to
give
it
up
i
wrote
to
her
you
took
down
the
letter
no
you
did
i
copied
that
one
myself
have
you
got
it
i
better
show
it
her
yes
it
it
confound
it
it
in
my
private
drawer
ca
i
find
it
he
hesitated
he
did
like
the
idea
of
anybody
even
little
barbara
rummaging
in
his
private
drawer
but
he
had
to
choose
the
lesser
of
two
evils
and
that
letter
would
put
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
here
the
key
he
said
and
gave
it
her
it
dated
october
the
thirtieth
or
but
it
all
humbug
i
reason
to
believe
that
money
was
never
invested
at
all
it
all
debts
she
has
a
leg
to
stand
on
not
a
leg
not
a
stump
said
barbara
leave
her
to
me
she
went
back
to
the
library
levitt
face
lifted
itself
in
excited
questioning
one
moment
mrs
levitt
after
a
slightly
prolonged
search
in
waddington
private
drawer
she
found
the
letter
of
october
tie
and
returned
with
it
to
the
office
it
was
very
short
and
clear
my
dear
elise
i
can
not
promise
anything
it
depends
on
circumstances
but
if
you
sent
me
the
name
and
address
of
your
solicitors
it
might
help
take
it
he
said
and
show
it
her
barbara
went
back
again
to
the
library
and
her
final
battle
with
elise
this
time
she
had
armed
herself
with
the
cheque
books
levitt
began
well
waddington
says
he
is
very
sorry
if
there
any
misunderstanding
i
do
know
whether
you
remember
getting
this
letter
from
him
levitt
blinked
hard
as
she
read
the
letter
of
course
i
remember
you
see
that
he
could
hardly
have
stated
his
position
more
clearly
but
this
letter
is
dated
october
the
the
promise
i
refer
to
was
made
long
after
that
it
does
appear
so
from
his
letters
all
that
i
taken
down
if
you
can
show
me
anything
in
writing
writing
waddington
is
a
gentleman
and
he
was
my
friend
i
never
dreamed
of
pinning
him
down
to
promises
in
writing
i
thought
his
word
was
enough
i
never
dreamed
of
his
going
back
on
it
and
after
compromising
me
the
way
he
done
barbara
eyebrows
lifted
delicately
innocently
he
compromised
you
he
has
how
never
mind
how
quite
enough
to
start
all
sorts
of
unpleasant
stories
you
should
listen
to
them
people
will
tell
stories
without
anything
to
start
them
that
does
make
them
any
less
unpleasant
i
should
have
thought
the
very
least
waddington
could
do
would
be
to
pay
you
compensation
there
can
be
no
compensation
in
a
case
of
this
sort
miss
madden
not
talking
about
compensation
waddington
must
realize
that
he
can
not
compromise
me
without
compromising
himself
i
should
think
he
would
realize
it
you
know
then
he
ought
to
realize
that
he
is
not
exactly
in
a
position
to
repudiate
his
engagements
do
you
consider
that
are
in
a
position
exactly
to
hold
him
to
engagements
he
never
entered
into
i
told
you
already
that
he
has
let
me
in
for
engagements
that
i
can
not
meet
if
he
goes
back
on
his
word
i
see
and
you
want
to
make
it
unpleasant
for
him
as
unpleasant
as
you
possibly
can
i
can
make
it
even
more
unpleasant
for
him
miss
madden
than
it
is
for
me
what
after
all
the
compromising
i
think
so
if
for
instance
i
chose
to
tell
somebody
what
happened
the
other
day
what
you
saw
yourself
i
see
anything
you
ca
deny
that
you
saw
something
you
were
not
meant
to
see
you
mean
wednesday
afternoon
well
if
waddington
chose
to
say
that
i
saw
you
in
a
bad
fit
of
hysterics
i
should
deny
i
see
you
well
posted
miss
madden
i
am
rather
but
supposing
you
told
everybody
in
the
place
he
was
caught
making
love
to
you
what
good
would
it
do
you
excuse
me
we
not
talking
about
the
good
it
would
do
me
but
the
harm
it
would
do
him
same
thing
said
barbara
supposing
you
told
everybody
and
nobody
believed
you
everybody
will
believe
me
you
forget
that
those
stories
have
been
going
about
long
before
wednesday
all
the
better
for
waddington
and
all
the
worse
for
you
you
were
compromised
before
wednesday
then
why
if
you
did
like
being
compromised
did
you
consent
to
come
to
tea
alone
with
him
when
his
wife
was
away
i
came
on
business
you
you
came
to
borrow
money
from
a
man
who
had
compromised
you
if
so
careful
of
your
reputation
i
should
have
thought
that
would
have
been
the
last
thing
you
have
done
you
forgetting
my
friendship
with
mr
waddington
you
said
business
just
now
friendship
or
business
or
business
friendship
i
do
think
you
making
out
a
very
good
case
for
yourself
levitt
but
supposing
you
did
make
it
out
and
supposing
waddington
did
lose
his
head
and
making
love
to
you
on
wednesday
do
you
imagine
people
here
are
going
to
take
part
against
he
not
so
popular
in
wyck
as
all
that
he
may
be
but
his
caste
is
immensely
popular
with
the
county
which
i
suppose
is
all
you
care
about
you
must
remember
levitt
that
he
waddington
of
wyck
you
not
fighting
one
waddington
but
three
hundred
years
of
waddingtons
you
up
against
all
his
ancestors
i
do
care
for
his
ancestors
said
levitt
with
a
gesture
of
the
thumb
you
may
not
i
certainly
do
but
other
people
do
major
markham
the
hawtreys
the
thurstons
even
the
corbetts
do
you
suppose
they
all
going
to
turn
against
him
because
he
lost
his
head
for
a
minute
on
a
wednesday
ten
to
one
they
all
think
and
you
made
him
do
it
i
made
him
preposterous
not
so
preposterous
as
you
imagine
you
must
make
allowances
for
people
prejudices
if
you
wanted
to
stand
clear
you
should
have
taken
all
that
money
from
him
all
that
money
indeed
a
loan
a
mere
temporary
loan
for
an
investment
he
recommended
not
only
that
loan
but
barbara
produced
the
cheque
books
with
their
damning
counterfoils
look
here
pounds
on
the
of
january
and
here
october
last
year
and
july
and
january
before
that
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
altogether
how
are
you
going
to
account
for
that
and
who
going
to
believe
that
waddington
paid
all
that
for
nothing
if
some
particularly
nasty
person
gets
up
and
says
he
did
you
see
what
a
horrible
position
you
be
in
do
you
levitt
did
answer
her
face
thickened
slightly
with
a
dreadful
flush
her
nerve
was
going
barbara
watched
it
go
she
followed
up
her
advantage
and
supposing
i
were
to
tell
everybody
his
friend
major
markham
say
that
you
were
pressing
him
for
that
five
hundred
immediately
the
affair
of
wednesday
on
threats
of
exposure
would
that
look
very
like
blackmail
blackmail
miss
madden
i
do
suppose
you
it
for
blackmail
i
only
pointing
out
what
it
look
like
it
wo
look
much
better
face
the
facts
you
do
waddington
any
real
harm
short
of
forcing
his
wife
to
get
a
separation
there
was
a
black
gleam
in
levitt
eyes
precisely
and
supposing
since
we
supposing
i
told
waddington
of
his
behaviour
too
late
waddington
has
told
her
himself
his
own
version
certainly
his
own
version
and
supposing
i
gave
mine
do
whatever
you
say
it
be
your
word
against
ours
and
she
believe
you
if
she
did
she
think
it
was
all
your
fault
and
remember
i
have
the
evidence
for
your
attempts
at
blackmail
i
do
think
said
barbara
going
to
the
door
and
opening
it
there
anything
more
to
be
said
levitt
walked
out
with
her
agitated
waddle
barbara
followed
her
amicably
to
the
front
door
there
elise
made
her
last
stand
afternoon
miss
madden
i
congratulate
waddington
on
the
partnership
barbara
rushed
to
the
relief
of
the
besieged
in
his
office
redoubt
it
all
over
she
shouted
at
him
joyously
waddington
did
not
answer
all
at
once
he
was
still
sitting
in
his
uneasy
windsor
chair
absorbed
in
meditation
he
had
brought
out
a
little
note
from
his
inmost
pocket
and
as
he
looked
at
it
he
smiled
it
began
thus
and
its
date
was
the
saturday
following
that
dreadful
wednesday
my
dear
waddington
after
the
way
you
have
stood
by
me
and
helped
me
in
the
past
i
can
not
believe
that
it
is
all
over
and
that
i
can
come
to
you
my
generous
friend
and
be
repulsed
he
looked
up
how
did
she
behave
barbara
oh
she
wanted
to
bite
to
bite
badly
but
i
drew
all
her
teeth
very
gently
one
by
one
teeth
elise
teeth
drawn
by
barbara
he
tore
the
note
into
little
bits
and
as
he
watched
them
flutter
into
the
basket
he
sighed
he
rose
heavily
let
go
and
tell
fanny
all
about
it
said
barbara
xiii
i
hope
you
realize
horatio
that
it
was
barbara
who
got
you
out
of
that
mess
barbara
showed
a
great
deal
of
intelligence
but
you
must
give
me
credit
for
some
tact
and
discretion
of
my
own
waddington
said
as
he
left
the
he
tactful
and
discreet
his
first
letters
said
barbara
were
masterpieces
of
tact
and
discretion
before
he
saw
the
danger
afterwards
i
think
his
nerve
may
have
gone
a
bit
whose
would
it
clever
of
you
barbara
all
the
same
it
must
have
been
rather
awful
going
for
her
like
that
yes
now
that
it
was
all
over
barbara
saw
that
it
had
been
awful
rather
like
a
she
had
been
going
round
and
round
rolling
with
levitt
in
the
mud
so
much
mud
that
for
purposes
of
sheer
cleanliness
it
hardly
seemed
to
matter
which
of
them
was
top
dog
at
the
finish
all
she
could
see
was
that
it
had
to
be
done
and
there
was
anybody
else
to
do
it
you
see
fanny
went
on
she
had
a
sort
of
case
he
making
love
to
her
and
she
did
like
it
it
does
seem
quite
fair
to
turn
on
her
after
that
she
did
all
the
turning
i
would
have
said
a
thing
if
she
tried
to
put
the
screw
on
somebody
had
got
to
stop
it
yes
fanny
said
yes
still
i
wish
we
could
have
let
her
go
in
peace
there
was
any
peace
for
her
to
go
in
and
she
would
have
gone
she
have
been
here
now
with
his
poor
thumb
in
her
screw
after
all
fanny
i
only
pointed
out
how
beastly
it
would
be
for
her
if
she
go
and
i
only
did
that
because
he
was
your
husband
and
it
was
your
thumb
really
yes
darling
yes
i
know
what
you
did
it
for
oh
i
wish
she
was
so
horribly
badly
off
so
do
i
then
it
would
have
happened
but
how
can
you
be
such
an
angel
to
her
fanny
i
not
i
only
decent
i
hate
using
our
position
to
break
her
poor
back
telling
her
we
waddingtons
of
wyck
and
she
only
mrs
levitt
it
was
the
handiest
weapon
and
you
did
use
it
not
a
waddington
of
wyck
besides
it
true
she
ca
blackmail
him
in
his
own
county
you
do
seem
to
realize
how
horrid
she
was
and
how
jolly
dangerous
no
fanny
said
i
do
realize
people
horridness
as
for
danger
i
do
want
to
disparage
your
performance
barbara
but
she
seems
to
me
to
have
been
an
easy
prey
you
disparaging
me
said
barbara
i
not
i
only
do
like
to
think
of
you
enjoying
that
nasty
scrap
i
only
enjoyed
it
on
your
account
and
i
ought
to
grudge
you
your
enjoyment
when
we
reap
the
benefit
i
do
know
what
horatio
would
have
done
without
you
i
shudder
to
think
of
the
mess
he
have
made
of
it
himself
he
was
making
rather
a
mess
of
it
barbara
said
when
i
took
it
on
well
said
fanny
i
daresay
i
a
goose
perhaps
i
ought
to
be
grateful
to
levitt
if
he
was
on
the
for
adventures
just
as
well
he
hit
on
one
that
keep
him
off
it
for
the
future
have
been
far
more
deadly
if
she
been
a
nice
woman
if
he
make
love
only
then
he
could
very
well
have
done
it
barbara
said
oh
could
he
you
never
can
tell
what
a
man
do
once
he
begun
said
fanny
meanwhile
levitt
stayed
on
having
failed
to
let
her
house
for
the
winter
she
seemed
to
be
acting
on
barbara
advice
and
refraining
from
any
malignant
activity
for
no
report
of
the
waddington
affair
had
as
yet
penetrated
into
the
and
little
dinners
at
punctually
every
friday
evening
thurston
of
the
elms
and
either
hawtrey
or
young
hawtrey
of
medlicott
turned
up
at
the
white
house
for
their
bridge
if
dick
benham
chose
to
write
venomous
letters
about
elise
levitt
to
old
markham
that
was
no
reason
why
they
should
throw
over
an
agreeable
woman
whose
hospitality
had
made
a
place
to
live
in
so
long
as
she
behaved
decently
the
place
they
kept
it
up
till
past
midnight
now
that
levitt
had
had
the
happy
idea
of
serving
a
delicious
supper
at
eleven
she
had
paid
her
debts
of
honour
with
waddington
five
pounds
the
fifty
she
reserved
in
fancy
for
the
cost
of
the
chickens
and
the
trifles
and
the
sauterne
in
thurston
and
the
hawtreys
the
bridge
habit
and
the
supper
habit
and
what
billy
hawtrey
called
the
levitty
habit
was
so
strong
that
it
overrode
their
sense
of
loyalty
to
major
markham
the
impression
created
by
dick
benham
only
heightened
their
enjoyment
in
doing
every
friday
what
thurston
and
hawtrey
persisted
in
regarding
as
a
risky
thing
there
was
no
harm
in
elise
levitt
they
said
so
every
friday
after
midnight
respectable
householders
sleeping
on
either
side
of
the
white
house
were
wakened
by
the
sudden
opening
of
her
door
by
shrill
good
nights
called
out
from
the
threshold
and
answered
by
bass
voices
up
the
street
by
the
shutting
of
the
door
and
the
shriek
of
the
bolt
as
it
slid
to
and
the
rector
went
about
saying
in
his
genial
way
that
he
liked
levitt
that
she
was
well
connected
and
that
there
was
no
harm
in
her
so
long
as
any
parishioner
was
a
frequent
attendant
at
church
and
a
regular
subscriber
to
the
coal
and
blanket
club
and
a
reliable
source
of
soup
and
puddings
for
the
poor
it
was
hard
to
persuade
him
that
there
was
any
harm
in
them
fanny
waddington
said
of
him
that
if
beelzebub
subscribed
to
his
coal
and
blanket
club
he
ask
him
to
tea
he
had
a
stiff
face
for
uncharitable
people
elise
was
received
almost
ostentatiously
at
the
rectory
as
a
protest
against
and
he
made
a
point
of
stopping
to
talk
to
her
when
he
met
her
in
the
street
this
might
have
meant
the
complete
rehabilitation
of
elise
but
that
the
rector
geniality
was
too
indiscriminate
too
perfunctory
too
christian
as
fanny
put
it
to
afford
any
sound
social
protection
and
ultimately
the
approval
of
the
rectory
was
disastrous
to
elise
letting
her
in
as
she
afterwards
complained
bitterly
for
miss
gregg
meanwhile
it
helped
her
with
people
like
bostock
and
cleaver
and
jackson
who
wanted
to
be
charitable
and
to
stand
well
with
the
rector
then
in
the
december
following
the
waddington
affair
wyck
was
astonished
by
the
friendship
that
sprang
up
suddenly
between
levitt
and
miss
gregg
the
governess
at
the
rectory
there
was
a
reason
for
it
there
always
is
a
reason
for
these
things
and
bostock
named
it
when
she
named
young
billy
hawtrey
friendship
with
levitt
provided
miss
gregg
with
unlimited
facilities
for
meeting
billy
who
was
always
running
over
from
medlicott
to
the
white
house
miss
gregg
passion
for
young
billy
hung
by
so
slender
so
nervous
and
so
insecure
a
thread
that
it
required
the
continual
support
of
conversation
with
an
experienced
and
sympathetic
friend
miss
gregg
had
never
known
anybody
so
sympathetic
and
so
experienced
as
levitt
the
first
time
they
were
alone
together
she
had
seen
by
elise
face
that
she
had
some
secret
like
her
own
miss
gregg
meant
major
markham
and
that
she
would
understand
and
one
strict
confidence
leading
to
another
before
very
long
miss
gregg
had
captured
that
part
of
elise
secret
that
related
to
waddington
it
was
through
miss
gregg
subsequent
activities
that
it
first
became
known
in
wyck
that
levitt
had
referred
to
waddington
as
that
horrible
old
man
this
might
have
been
very
damaging
to
waddington
but
that
annie
trinder
at
the
manor
had
told
her
aunt
trinder
that
waddington
spoke
of
levitt
as
that
horrible
woman
and
had
given
orders
that
she
was
not
to
be
admitted
if
she
called
it
was
then
felt
that
there
might
possibly
be
more
than
one
side
to
the
question
then
bit
by
bit
through
the
repeated
indiscretions
of
miss
gregg
the
whole
affair
of
levitt
and
waddington
came
out
it
travelled
direct
from
miss
gregg
to
the
younger
miss
hawtrey
of
medlicott
and
finally
reached
sir
john
corbett
by
way
of
old
hawtrey
who
had
it
from
his
wife
who
did
believe
a
word
of
it
sir
john
did
believe
a
word
of
it
either
at
any
rate
that
was
what
he
said
to
lady
corbett
to
himself
he
wondered
whether
there
something
in
it
he
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
the
next
time
he
saw
waddington
he
get
it
out
of
him
he
saw
him
the
very
next
day
ever
since
that
dreadful
wednesday
an
uneasy
mind
had
kept
waddington
for
ever
calling
on
his
neighbours
he
wanted
to
find
out
from
their
behaviour
and
their
faces
whether
they
knew
anything
and
how
much
they
knew
he
lived
in
perpetual
fear
of
what
that
horrible
woman
might
say
or
do
the
memory
of
what
had
said
and
done
that
wednesday
no
longer
disturbed
his
complete
satisfaction
with
himself
he
could
think
of
elise
as
horrible
without
at
the
same
time
thinking
of
himself
as
the
pure
and
chivalrous
spirit
that
had
resisted
her
automatically
he
thought
of
himself
as
pure
and
chivalrous
and
in
the
rare
but
beastly
moments
when
he
did
remember
what
he
had
done
and
said
to
elise
and
what
elise
had
done
and
said
to
him
when
he
felt
again
her
hand
beating
him
off
and
heard
her
voice
crying
out
you
old
imbecile
automatically
he
thought
of
her
as
cold
some
women
were
like
that
cold
deficient
in
natural
feeling
only
an
abnormal
coldness
could
have
made
her
repulse
him
as
she
did
she
had
told
him
to
his
face
in
her
indecent
way
that
love
was
most
ridiculous
thing
he
could
for
the
life
of
him
understand
how
a
thing
that
was
so
delightful
to
other
women
could
he
ridiculous
to
elise
but
there
it
was
absolutely
abnormal
that
his
vanity
received
immense
consolation
in
thinking
of
elise
as
abnormal
his
mind
passed
without
a
jolt
or
a
jar
from
one
consideration
to
its
opposite
elise
was
cold
and
he
was
normally
and
nobly
passionate
elise
was
horrible
and
he
was
chivalrously
pure
whichever
way
he
had
it
he
was
consoled
but
you
could
tell
in
what
awful
light
the
thing
might
present
itself
to
other
people
it
was
this
doubt
that
drove
him
to
underwoods
one
afternoon
early
in
january
ostensibly
to
deliver
his
greetings
for
the
new
year
after
tea
sir
john
lured
him
into
his
library
for
a
smoke
the
peculiar
smile
and
twinkle
at
play
on
his
fat
face
should
have
warned
waddington
of
what
was
imminent
they
puffed
in
an
amicable
silence
for
about
two
minutes
before
he
began
ever
see
anything
of
levitt
now
waddington
raised
his
eyebrows
as
if
surprised
at
this
impertinence
he
seemed
to
be
debating
with
himself
whether
he
would
condescend
to
answer
it
or
not
no
he
said
presently
i
do
taken
my
advice
and
dropped
it
have
you
i
should
say
rather
it
dropped
itself
i
glad
to
hear
that
waddington
i
very
glad
to
hear
it
i
always
said
you
know
you
get
landed
if
you
did
look
out
my
dear
corbett
i
did
look
out
you
do
imagine
i
was
going
to
be
let
in
more
than
i
could
help
wise
after
the
event
what
waddington
thought
he
trying
to
pump
me
he
was
determined
not
to
be
pumped
corbett
should
not
get
anything
out
of
him
after
what
event
fanny
called
several
times
but
she
does
care
to
keep
it
up
neither
to
tell
the
honest
truth
do
i
why
sir
john
was
twinkling
at
him
in
his
exasperating
way
why
because
my
dear
fellow
the
woman
going
about
everywhere
saying
she
given
up
i
do
care
said
waddington
what
she
says
quite
immaterial
to
me
you
may
care
but
your
friends
do
waddington
it
very
good
of
them
but
they
can
save
themselves
the
trouble
he
thought
he
is
going
to
get
anything
out
of
me
oh
come
you
do
suppose
we
believe
a
word
of
it
they
looked
at
each
other
sir
john
thought
i
get
it
out
of
him
and
waddington
thought
i
get
it
out
of
him
you
might
as
well
tell
me
what
you
talking
about
he
said
my
dear
chap
it
what
levitt
talking
about
that
the
point
mrs
levitt
yes
she
a
dangerous
woman
waddington
i
told
you
you
were
doing
a
risky
thing
taking
up
with
her
like
that
and
there
hawtrey
doing
the
same
thing
the
very
same
thing
but
he
a
man
so
i
suppose
he
thinks
he
safe
but
if
he
was
ten
years
younger
hang
it
all
waddington
if
i
was
a
younger
man
i
should
feel
safe
i
should
really
i
ca
think
what
there
is
about
her
something
yes
said
waddington
there
something
something
he
was
going
to
let
corbett
think
him
so
that
he
was
impervious
to
its
charm
what
is
it
said
sir
john
she
is
handsome
yet
she
gets
all
the
young
fellows
running
after
her
there
was
markham
and
thurston
and
there
young
hawtrey
it
only
sober
old
chaps
like
me
who
do
get
landed
upon
my
word
waddington
i
should
blame
you
if
you
lost
your
head
waddington
felt
shaken
in
his
determination
not
to
let
corbett
get
it
out
of
him
it
was
also
clear
that
if
he
did
admit
to
having
for
one
wild
moment
lost
his
head
corbett
would
think
none
the
worse
of
him
he
would
then
be
classed
with
markham
and
young
billy
whereas
if
he
denied
it
he
would
only
rank
himself
with
old
fossils
like
corbett
and
he
could
bear
it
there
was
such
a
thing
as
doing
yourself
an
unnecessary
injustice
sir
john
watched
him
hovering
round
the
trap
he
had
laid
for
him
absolutely
between
ourselves
he
said
you
under
waddington
moustache
you
could
see
the
rabelaisian
smile
answering
the
rabelaisian
twinkle
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
resist
it
well
between
ourselves
corbett
absolutely
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
did
there
something
about
her
just
for
a
second
you
know
it
did
come
to
anything
did
it
she
says
you
made
violent
love
to
her
i
wo
swear
what
i
would
have
done
if
i
had
pulled
myself
up
in
time
at
this
point
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
elise
had
betrayed
the
secret
of
his
she
would
also
have
told
her
own
tale
of
its
repulse
that
had
to
be
accounted
for
i
can
tell
you
one
queer
thing
about
that
woman
corbett
cold
cold
oh
come
waddington
you
would
think
it
i
do
said
sir
john
with
a
loud
guffaw
but
i
assure
you
my
dear
corbett
she
simply
wooden
talk
of
making
love
you
might
as
well
make
love
to
to
a
chair
or
a
cabinet
i
can
tell
you
markham
had
a
lucky
escape
i
do
imagine
that
what
put
him
off
said
sir
john
he
knew
something
what
do
you
suppose
he
knew
something
the
benhams
told
them
i
fancy
they
some
queer
story
rather
think
she
ran
after
dicky
and
benham
did
like
it
do
know
what
she
wanted
with
him
could
have
been
in
love
with
him
i
will
say
that
for
her
well
she
seems
to
have
preferred
their
bungalow
to
her
own
anyhow
they
could
get
her
out
of
it
i
do
believe
that
story
we
must
be
fair
to
the
woman
corbett
he
thought
he
had
really
done
it
very
well
not
only
had
he
accounted
honourably
for
his
repulse
but
he
had
cleared
elise
and
he
had
cleared
himself
from
the
ghastly
imputation
of
repulse
or
no
repulse
he
was
proud
of
his
spurt
of
youthful
passion
and
in
another
minute
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
his
main
motive
had
been
the
desire
to
be
fair
to
elise
h
i
do
know
about
being
fair
said
sir
john
anyhow
i
congratulate
you
on
your
lucky
escape
waddington
rose
to
go
of
course
about
what
i
told
you
you
let
it
go
any
further
sir
john
laughed
out
loud
of
course
i
wo
only
wanted
to
know
how
far
went
might
have
gone
farther
and
fared
worse
what
he
rose
too
laughing
if
anybody
tries
to
pump
me
i
shall
say
you
behaved
very
well
so
you
did
my
dear
fellow
so
you
did
considering
the
provocation
he
could
afford
to
laugh
he
had
got
it
out
of
poor
old
waddington
as
he
said
he
would
but
to
the
eternal
honour
of
sir
john
corbett
it
did
not
go
any
further
when
people
tried
to
get
it
out
of
him
he
simply
said
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
and
that
to
his
certain
knowledge
waddington
had
behaved
very
well
as
barbara
had
prophesied
nobody
believed
that
he
had
behaved
otherwise
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
he
was
waddington
of
wyck
and
in
consequence
of
the
revelations
she
had
made
to
her
friend
miss
gregg
very
early
in
the
new
year
elise
found
other
doors
closed
to
her
besides
the
markhams
and
the
waddingtons
and
behind
the
doors
on
each
side
of
the
white
house
respectable
householders
could
sleep
in
their
beds
on
friday
nights
without
fear
of
being
wakened
by
the
opening
and
shutting
of
levitt
door
and
by
the
shrill
good
nights
called
out
from
its
threshold
and
answered
up
the
street
the
merry
bridge
parties
and
the
little
suppers
were
no
more
even
the
rector
geniality
grew
more
and
more
christian
and
perfunctory
till
he
too
left
off
stopping
to
talk
to
levitt
when
he
met
her
in
the
street
waddington
confession
to
sir
john
was
about
the
only
statement
relating
to
the
waddington
affair
which
did
not
go
any
further
thus
a
very
curious
and
interesting
report
of
it
reached
ralph
bevan
through
colonel
grainger
when
he
heard
for
the
first
time
of
the
part
barbara
had
played
in
it
in
the
story
elise
had
told
in
strict
confidence
to
miss
gregg
waddington
had
been
deadly
afraid
of
her
and
had
beaten
a
cowardly
retreat
behind
barbara
big
guns
not
that
either
elise
or
miss
gregg
would
have
admitted
for
one
moment
that
her
guns
were
big
colonel
grainger
had
merely
inferred
the
deadliness
of
her
fire
from
the
demoralization
of
the
enemy
your
little
lady
bevan
he
said
seems
to
have
come
off
best
in
that
encounter
we
need
worry
any
more
about
the
compact
barbara
now
i
know
about
it
ralph
said
as
they
walked
together
snow
had
fallen
the
cotswolds
were
all
white
netted
with
the
purplish
brown
of
the
trees
their
feet
went
crunching
through
the
furry
crystals
of
the
snow
no
that
one
good
thing
she
done
was
it
very
funny
your
scrap
it
seemed
funnier
at
the
time
than
it
did
afterwards
it
was
really
rather
beastly
fanny
did
like
it
you
could
hardly
expect
her
to
there
a
limit
to
fanny
sense
of
humour
there
a
limit
to
mine
fanny
was
right
i
had
to
fight
her
with
the
filthiest
weapons
i
had
to
tell
her
she
could
do
anything
because
he
was
waddington
of
wyck
and
she
was
up
against
all
his
ancestors
i
had
to
drag
in
his
ancestors
that
was
bad
i
know
it
was
it
what
fanny
hated
and
no
wonder
she
made
me
feel
such
a
miserable
little
snob
ralph
fanny
did
yes
could
have
done
it
she
have
let
her
do
her
damnedest
that
because
fanny
an
incurable
little
aristocrat
she
got
more
waddington
of
wyckedness
in
her
little
finger
than
horatio
has
in
all
his
ego
and
she
despises
levitt
she
would
have
condescended
to
scrap
with
her
the
horrible
thing
is
it
true
he
can
do
what
he
likes
and
nothing
happens
to
him
he
can
turn
the
ballingers
out
of
their
house
and
nothing
happens
he
can
make
love
to
a
woman
who
does
want
to
be
made
love
to
and
nothing
happens
because
he
waddington
of
wyck
he
waddington
of
wyck
but
he
is
such
a
bad
old
thing
really
people
laugh
at
him
but
they
like
him
because
he
so
funny
and
they
taken
levitt
measure
pretty
accurately
you
do
think
then
i
was
too
big
a
beast
to
her
ralph
laughed
somebody
had
to
save
him
ralph
after
all
he
fanny
husband
yes
after
all
he
fanny
husband
so
you
do
do
you
of
course
i
do
what
he
doing
now
oh
just
pottering
about
with
his
book
it
nearly
finished
you
kept
it
up
rather
there
is
a
sentence
he
might
have
written
himself
i
think
i
going
to
let
him
go
back
to
lower
wyck
on
the
last
page
and
end
there
in
his
manor
i
thought
of
putting
something
in
about
halls
and
yule
logs
on
the
christmas
hearth
he
was
photographed
the
other
day
in
the
snow
gorgeous
i
wonder
if
he
really
settle
down
now
or
if
he
do
it
all
over
again
some
day
with
somebody
else
you
ca
tell
you
ca
possibly
tell
he
may
do
anything
that
what
we
feel
about
him
barbara
said
endless
possibilities
yet
you
think
he
could
go
one
better
than
mrs
levitt
for
the
next
they
disputed
whether
in
the
scene
with
levitt
he
was
or
was
not
really
funny
ralph
was
inclined
to
think
that
he
might
have
been
purely
disgusting
you
did
him
ralph
you
no
right
to
say
he
was
funny
no
no
i
did
see
him
you
need
rub
it
in
barbara
we
got
to
wait
and
see
what
he
does
next
it
may
be
your
turn
any
day
we
ca
expect
him
to
do
very
much
for
a
little
while
he
must
be
a
bit
exhausted
with
this
last
stunt
yes
and
the
funny
thing
is
he
has
moments
when
you
do
laugh
at
him
moments
of
calm
beautiful
peace
you
come
on
him
walking
in
his
garden
looking
for
snowdrops
in
the
snow
or
he
sitting
in
his
library
reading
buchan
of
the
great
war
happy
not
thinking
about
himself
at
all
then
you
sorry
you
ever
laughed
at
him
i
not
ralph
said
he
owes
it
us
he
does
nothing
else
to
justify
his
existence
yes
but
he
exists
he
exists
and
somehow
it
pretty
mysterious
when
you
think
of
it
you
wonder
whether
you
may
have
seen
him
all
wrong
whether
all
the
time
he
is
just
a
simple
old
thing
when
you
get
that
feeling
of
his
mysteriousness
ralph
somehow
you
done
i
have
had
it
yet
oh
it
there
you
get
it
some
day
you
see
barbara
how
right
i
was
we
ca
keep
off
him
xiv
it
was
sunday
the
last
week
of
horry
holidays
all
through
supper
he
had
been
talking
about
cycling
to
cirencester
if
the
frost
held
to
skate
on
the
canal
the
frost
did
hold
and
in
the
morning
he
strapped
a
cushion
on
the
carrier
of
his
bicycle
and
called
up
the
stairs
to
barbara
come
along
barbara
let
go
to
cirencester
barbara
appeared
ready
carrying
her
skates
waddington
had
let
her
off
the
ramblings
yet
all
of
a
sudden
she
looked
depressed
oh
horry
she
said
i
was
going
with
ralph
you
are
said
horry
you
always
going
with
ralph
jolly
well
coming
with
me
this
time
but
i
promised
him
you
no
business
to
promise
him
when
it
the
last
week
of
my
holidays
is
fair
fanny
came
out
into
the
hall
horry
she
said
do
worry
barbara
ca
you
see
she
wants
to
go
with
ralph
that
exactly
he
said
what
i
complain
of
she
shook
her
head
at
him
you
your
father
all
over
again
she
said
i
swear
i
not
said
horry
if
you
were
half
as
polite
as
your
father
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
there
was
a
sound
of
explosions
in
the
drive
there
ralph
come
to
settle
it
himself
said
fanny
and
at
that
point
waddington
came
out
on
them
suddenly
from
the
what
all
this
he
said
he
looked
with
disgust
at
the
skates
dangling
from
barbara
hand
he
went
out
into
the
porch
and
looked
with
disgust
at
ralph
and
at
the
he
thought
with
bitterness
of
the
cirencester
canal
he
could
skate
even
when
he
was
age
he
had
skated
he
could
ride
a
when
he
looked
at
the
beastly
things
and
thought
of
their
complicated
machinery
and
their
evil
fascination
for
barbara
he
hated
them
he
hated
horry
and
ralph
standing
up
before
barbara
handsome
vibrating
with
youth
and
health
and
energy
i
wo
have
barbara
riding
on
that
thing
it
is
safe
if
he
skids
on
the
snow
he
break
her
neck
much
more
likely
to
break
his
own
neck
said
horry
in
his
savage
interior
waddington
wished
he
would
and
horry
too
he
wo
skid
said
barbara
if
he
does
i
hop
off
we
come
back
said
ralph
if
we
do
get
on
all
right
they
started
in
a
duet
of
explosions
the
hissing
and
crunching
through
the
light
snow
barbara
swinging
on
ralph
carrier
waved
her
hand
to
waddington
he
hated
barbara
but
far
more
than
barbara
he
hated
horry
and
far
more
than
horry
he
hated
ralph
he
no
business
to
take
her
he
said
she
no
business
to
go
you
ca
stop
them
my
dear
said
fanny
they
too
young
well
if
they
come
back
with
their
necks
broken
they
have
only
themselves
to
thank
he
took
a
ferocious
pleasure
in
thinking
of
horry
and
ralph
and
barbara
with
their
necks
broken
fanny
stared
at
him
i
wonder
what
made
him
so
cross
she
thought
he
looks
as
if
he
got
a
chill
on
the
horatio
have
you
got
a
chill
on
the
liver
now
what
on
earth
put
that
into
your
head
your
face
you
look
just
a
little
off
colour
darling
at
that
moment
waddington
began
to
sneeze
there
i
knew
you
caught
cold
you
ought
to
go
standing
about
in
draughts
i
have
caught
cold
said
waddington
but
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
library
and
stayed
there
huddled
in
his
armchair
from
time
to
time
he
leaned
forward
and
stooped
over
the
hearth
holding
his
chest
and
stomach
as
near
as
possible
to
the
fire
shivers
like
thin
icicles
kept
on
slipping
down
his
spine
at
he
complained
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
eat
and
before
the
meal
was
over
he
went
back
to
his
library
and
his
fire
fanny
sat
with
him
there
i
wish
you
would
go
standing
out
in
the
cold
she
said
she
knew
that
on
saturday
he
had
stood
for
more
than
ten
minutes
in
the
fallen
snow
of
the
park
to
be
photographed
and
he
would
wear
his
overcoat
because
he
thought
he
looked
younger
without
it
and
slenderer
no
wonder
you
got
a
chill
she
said
i
did
get
it
then
i
got
it
yesterday
in
the
garden
she
remembered
he
had
been
wandering
about
the
garden
after
church
looking
for
snowdrops
in
the
snow
barbara
had
worn
the
snowdrops
in
the
breast
of
her
gown
last
night
he
nourished
his
resentment
on
that
memory
and
on
the
thought
that
he
had
got
his
chill
picking
snowdrops
for
barbara
at
he
drank
a
little
tea
but
he
could
eat
anything
he
felt
sick
and
his
head
ached
at
on
fanny
advice
he
went
to
bed
and
fanny
took
his
temperature
a
hundred
and
one
he
turned
the
thermometer
in
his
hand
gazing
earnestly
at
the
slender
silver
thread
he
was
gratified
to
know
that
his
temperature
was
a
hundred
and
one
and
that
fanny
was
frightened
and
had
sent
for
the
doctor
he
had
a
queer
satisfied
exalted
feeling
now
that
he
was
in
for
it
when
barbara
came
back
she
would
know
what
he
was
in
for
and
be
frightened
too
he
would
have
been
still
more
gratified
if
he
had
known
that
without
him
dinner
was
a
miserable
affair
fanny
showed
that
she
was
frightened
and
her
fear
flattened
down
the
high
spirits
of
ralph
and
barbara
and
horry
returned
from
their
skating
you
see
barbara
said
ralph
when
they
had
left
fanny
and
horry
with
the
doctor
we
ca
live
without
him
they
listened
at
the
door
for
the
sound
of
departure
and
ralph
waited
while
barbara
went
back
and
brought
him
the
verdict
it
flu
and
a
touch
of
congestion
of
the
lungs
they
looked
at
each
other
sorrowfully
so
sorrowfully
that
they
smiled
yet
we
can
smile
he
said
you
know
said
barbara
he
got
it
standing
in
the
snow
while
pyecraft
photographed
him
it
the
way
ralph
said
he
would
get
it
and
barbara
laughed
but
all
the
same
she
felt
a
distinct
pang
at
her
heart
every
time
she
went
into
her
bedroom
and
saw
in
its
glass
on
her
the
bunch
of
snowdrops
that
waddington
had
picked
for
her
in
the
snow
they
made
a
pattern
on
her
mind
white
cones
hanging
down
sharp
green
blades
piercing
green
stalks
held
in
the
crystal
of
the
water
nobody
but
a
fool
said
horry
would
have
stood
out
in
the
snow
to
be
photographed
at
his
age
do
horry
barbara
was
in
the
stirring
some
black
sticky
stuff
in
a
saucepan
over
the
fire
the
black
sticky
stuff
was
to
go
on
waddington
chest
horry
looked
on
standing
beside
her
in
an
attitude
of
impatience
a
pair
of
boots
with
skates
clipped
on
hung
from
his
shoulders
by
their
laces
he
felt
that
his
irritation
was
justifiable
for
barbara
had
refused
to
go
out
skating
with
him
why
said
horry
it
obvious
very
but
he
there
ca
be
much
the
matter
with
him
or
the
mater
would
look
so
chirpy
she
likes
nursing
him
well
horry
said
ca
nurse
him
no
but
i
can
stir
this
stuff
said
barbara
i
suppose
horry
said
you
think
me
an
awful
brute
if
i
went
i
wish
you
go
you
a
much
more
awful
brute
standing
there
saying
things
about
him
and
getting
in
my
way
all
right
i
get
out
of
it
that
jolly
easy
and
he
went
but
he
felt
sick
and
sore
he
had
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
his
father
was
ill
because
he
could
bear
to
think
how
ill
he
was
it
interfered
with
his
enjoyment
of
his
skating
if
he
said
to
himself
if
he
only
put
it
off
till
the
ice
gave
but
it
was
just
like
him
to
choose
a
hard
frost
his
anger
gave
him
relief
from
the
sickening
anxiety
he
felt
when
he
thought
of
his
father
and
his
father
temperature
it
had
gone
down
but
not
to
normal
waddington
lay
in
his
bed
in
fanny
room
barbara
standing
at
the
open
door
with
her
saucepan
caught
a
sight
of
him
he
was
propped
up
by
his
pillows
on
his
shoulders
over
one
of
those
striped
pyjama
suits
that
barbara
had
once
ordered
from
the
stores
he
wore
like
a
shawl
a
woolly
of
fanny
his
arms
were
laid
before
him
on
the
counterpane
in
a
gesture
of
complete
surrender
to
his
illness
fanny
was
always
tucking
them
away
under
the
blankets
but
if
anybody
came
in
he
would
have
them
so
he
was
sitting
up
waiting
in
an
adorable
patience
for
something
to
be
done
for
him
his
face
had
the
calm
happy
look
of
expectation
utterly
appeased
and
resigned
it
was
that
look
that
frightened
barbara
it
made
her
think
that
waddington
was
going
to
die
supposing
his
congestion
turned
to
pneumonia
there
was
so
much
of
him
to
be
ill
and
those
big
men
always
did
die
when
they
got
pneumonia
waddington
could
hear
barbara
quiet
voice
saying
something
to
fanny
he
could
see
her
unhappy
anxious
face
he
enjoyed
anxiety
he
enjoyed
the
cause
of
it
his
illness
so
long
as
he
was
actually
alive
he
even
enjoyed
the
thought
that
if
his
congestion
turned
to
pneumonia
he
might
actually
die
there
was
a
dignity
a
prestige
about
being
dead
that
appealed
to
him
even
his
high
temperature
and
his
headache
and
his
shooting
pains
and
his
difficulty
in
breathing
could
not
altogether
spoil
his
pleasure
in
the
delicious
concern
of
everybody
about
him
and
in
his
exquisite
certainty
that
at
any
minute
a
moan
would
bring
fanny
to
his
side
he
was
the
one
person
in
the
house
that
counted
he
had
always
known
it
but
he
had
never
felt
it
with
the
same
intensity
as
now
the
mind
of
every
person
in
the
house
was
concentrated
on
him
now
as
it
had
not
been
concentrated
before
he
was
holding
them
all
in
a
tension
of
worry
and
anxiety
he
would
apologize
very
sweetly
for
the
trouble
he
was
giving
everybody
declaring
that
it
made
him
very
uncomfortable
but
even
fanny
could
see
that
he
was
gratified
and
as
he
got
worse
before
he
became
too
ill
to
think
about
it
at
all
he
had
a
muzzy
yet
pleasurable
sense
that
everybody
in
and
in
the
county
for
miles
round
was
thinking
of
him
he
knew
that
corbett
and
lady
corbett
and
markham
and
thurston
and
the
hawtreys
and
the
rector
and
the
rector
wife
and
colonel
grainger
had
called
repeatedly
to
inquire
for
him
he
was
particularly
gratified
by
grainger
calling
he
knew
that
hitchin
had
stopped
horry
in
the
street
to
ask
after
him
and
he
was
particularly
gratified
by
that
old
had
come
up
from
medlicott
to
see
him
and
ralph
bevan
called
every
day
that
gratified
him
too
the
only
person
who
was
not
allowed
to
know
anything
about
his
illness
was
his
mother
for
waddington
was
certain
it
would
kill
her
every
evening
at
medicine
time
he
would
ask
the
same
questions
my
mother
does
know
yet
and
anybody
called
and
fanny
would
give
him
the
messages
and
he
would
receive
them
with
a
gentle
solemn
sweetness
you
would
have
believed
barbara
said
to
herself
that
complacency
could
take
so
heartrending
a
form
and
under
it
all
a
deeper
bliss
in
bliss
was
the
thought
that
barbara
was
thinking
about
him
worrying
about
him
and
being
probably
ten
times
more
unhappy
about
him
than
fanny
after
working
so
long
by
his
side
her
separation
from
him
would
be
intolerable
to
barbara
intolerable
very
likely
the
thought
that
it
was
fanny
turn
now
to
be
by
his
side
every
day
she
brought
him
a
bunch
of
snowdrops
and
every
day
as
the
door
closed
on
her
little
anxious
face
he
was
sorry
for
barbara
shut
out
from
his
room
poor
little
barbara
sometimes
when
he
was
feeling
well
enough
he
would
call
to
her
come
in
barbara
and
she
would
come
in
and
look
at
him
and
put
her
flowers
into
his
hand
and
say
she
hoped
he
was
better
and
he
would
answer
not
much
better
barbara
i
very
he
even
allowed
ralph
to
come
and
look
at
him
he
would
hold
his
hand
in
a
clasp
that
he
made
as
limp
as
possible
on
purpose
and
would
say
in
a
voice
artificially
weakened
i
very
ill
ralph
ransome
said
he
was
but
waddington
knew
better
it
was
true
that
from
time
to
time
he
rallied
sufficiently
to
comb
his
own
hair
before
barbara
was
let
in
with
her
snowdrops
and
that
he
could
give
orders
to
partridge
in
a
loud
firm
tone
but
he
was
too
ill
to
do
more
than
whisper
huskily
to
barbara
and
fanny
then
when
he
felt
a
little
better
the
trained
nurse
came
and
with
the
sheer
excitement
of
her
coming
waddington
temperature
leapt
up
again
and
the
doctor
owned
that
he
did
like
that
and
barbara
found
fanny
in
the
library
crying
she
had
been
tidying
up
his
going
over
all
his
papers
with
a
feather
brush
and
she
had
come
on
the
manuscript
of
the
ramblings
unfinished
fanny
barbara
i
know
i
an
idiot
but
i
simply
can
not
bear
it
it
was
all
very
well
as
long
as
i
could
nurse
him
but
now
that
woman
come
there
nothing
i
can
do
for
him
i
i
never
done
anything
all
my
life
for
him
he
always
done
everything
for
me
and
i
been
a
brute
always
laughing
at
him
think
barbara
think
for
eighteen
years
never
to
have
taken
him
seriously
never
since
i
married
him
i
believe
he
going
to
die
just
just
to
punish
me
he
is
said
barbara
indignantly
as
if
she
had
never
believed
it
herself
the
doctor
says
he
is
really
very
ill
the
congestion
spreading
it
was
better
yesterday
it
be
worse
you
may
depend
on
it
the
doctor
his
temperature
flying
up
and
down
like
that
it
go
down
again
said
barbara
you
do
know
what
it
do
said
fanny
darkly
did
you
ever
see
such
a
lamb
such
a
as
he
is
when
he
ill
no
said
barbara
he
an
angel
that
just
said
fanny
what
makes
me
feel
he
going
to
die
i
wish
i
were
you
barbara
me
yes
you
really
helped
him
he
could
never
have
written
his
book
without
you
his
poor
book
she
sat
stroking
it
and
suddenly
a
horrible
memory
overcame
her
and
she
cried
out
oh
my
god
and
i
laughed
at
that
too
barbara
put
her
arm
round
her
you
did
darling
well
if
you
did
it
is
a
little
funny
you
know
i
afraid
i
laughed
a
bit
oh
that
does
matter
you
helped
to
write
it
then
barbara
broke
out
oh
do
fanny
do
talk
about
his
poor
book
i
ca
it
we
both
idiots
said
fanny
imbeciles
she
paused
drying
her
eyes
he
liked
the
snowdrops
you
brought
him
she
said
barbara
thought
and
the
snowdrops
he
brought
he
had
caught
cold
that
day
picking
them
they
had
withered
in
the
glass
in
her
bedroom
she
left
fanny
only
to
come
upon
horry
in
his
agony
horry
stood
in
the
window
of
the
staring
out
and
scowling
at
the
snow
damn
the
snow
he
said
it
killed
him
it
has
horry
she
said
he
get
better
he
wo
get
better
if
this
beastly
frost
holds
he
has
got
a
chance
horry
dear
the
doctor
says
he
better
he
does
he
says
his
temperature
got
no
business
to
go
up
all
the
same
supposing
he
does
think
him
better
supposing
he
does
know
supposing
he
a
bleating
idiot
i
expect
the
dear
old
pater
knows
how
he
is
a
jolly
sight
better
than
anybody
can
tell
him
and
you
know
you

laughed
at
him

give

he
was
silent
a
moment
then
he
swung
round
full
to
her

face
burned
his
eyes
flashed
tears
he
held
his
head
up
to
stop
them
falling
barbara
if
he
dies
i
kill
myself
that
evening
waddington
temperature
went
up
another
point
ralph
calling
about
nine
found
barbara
alone
in
the
library
huddled
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
with
her
beside
her
rolled
in
a
tight
damp
ball
she
started
as
he
came
in
oh

said

thought

pigs
to
him
nonsense
that
would
make
him
i
not
so
sure
it
awful
to
see
him
lying
there
like
a
lamb
so
good
when
you
think
how
we
hunted
and
hounded
him
he
did
know
barbara
we
never
let
him

to
say
cruel
things

ralph
thoughtfully

much
since

show
what
brutes
we
been
that
he
has
to
be
ill
in
order
to
enjoy
himself
oh

he
enjoys
himself

barbara
all
the
time

enjoying
his
illness
he
likes
to
have
everybody
fussing
round
him
and
thinking
about
him
that
what
i
mean
we
never
did
think
of
him
not
seriously
done
nothing
nothing
but
laugh
why
you
laughing
now
horrible
of
you
ralph
when
he
may
be
dying
it
would
serve
us
all
jolly
well
right
if
he
did
die
to
her
surprise
and
indignation
barbara
began
to
cry
the
hard
damp
lump
of
was
not
a
bit
of
good
and
before
she
could
reach
out
for
it
ralph
arms
were
round
her
and
he
was
kissing
the
tears
off
one
by
one
darling
i
did
think
you
really
minded
what
you
then
she
sobbed
i
thought
you
were
playing
a
sort
of
variation
of
the
game
i
told
you
it
was
a
cruel
game
never
mind
it
all
over
we
never
play
it
again
and
he
be
well
in
another
week
look
here
barbara
ca
you
leave
off
thinking
about
him
for
a
minute
you
know
i
love
you
most
awfully
do
you
yes
i
know
now
all
right
and
know
how
do
you
know
because
old
thing
you
never
ceased
to
hang
on
to
my
collar
since
i
grabbed
you
you
ca
go
back
on
i
do
want
to
go
back
on
it
i
say
we
always
said
he
brought
us
together
and
he
this
time
when
later
that
night
ralph
told
fanny
of
their
engagement
the
first
thing
she
said
was
you
must
tell
him
not
till
he
well
again
in
fact
i
rather
you
did
tell
him
till
just
before
you
married
why
ever
not
it
might
upset
him
you
see
she
said
he
very
fond
of
barbara
the
next
day
waddington
temperature
went
down
to
normal
and
the
next
when
ralph
called
barbara
fairly
rushed
at
him
with
the
news
he
sitting
up
she
shouted
eating
a
piece
of
sole
hooray
now
we
can
be
happy
the
sound
of
fanny
humming
came
through
the
door
xv
waddington
was
sitting
up
in
his
armchair
before
the
bedroom
fire
by
turning
his
head
a
little
to
the
right
he
could
command
a
perfect
view
of
himself
in
the
long
glass
by
the
window
to
get
up
and
look
at
himself
in
that
glass
had
been
the
first
act
of
his
convalescence
he
had
hardly
dared
to
think
what
alterations
his
illness
might
have
made
in
him
he
remembered
the
horrible
sight
that
corbett
had
presented
after
influenza
last
year
looking
earnestly
at
himself
in
the
glass
he
had
found
that
his
appearance
was
if
anything
improved
outlines
that
he
had
missed
for
the
last
ten
years
were
showing
up
again
the
postlethwaite
nose
was
cleaner
cut
he
was
almost
slender
and
not
half
so
weak
as
fanny
said
he
ought
to
have
been
immobility
in
bed
his
spiritual
attitude
of
complacent
acquiescence
and
the
release
of
his
whole
organism
from
the
strain
of
a
restless
intellect
had
set
him
up
more
than
his
influenza
had
pulled
him
down
and
it
was
a
distinctly
more
refined
and
youthful
waddington
that
barbara
found
sitting
in
the
armchair
wearing
a
royal
blue
wadded
silk
and
fanny
with
a
grey
mohair
shawl
over
his
knees
waddington
convalescence
was
altogether
delightful
to
him
admitting
as
it
did
of
sustained
companionship
with
barbara
as
soon
as
it
reached
the
armchair
stage
she
sat
with
him
for
hours
together
she
had
finished
the
ramblings
and
at
his
request
she
read
them
aloud
to
him
all
over
again
from
beginning
to
end
waddington
was
much
gratified
by
the
impression
they
made
recited
in
barbara
charming
voice
the
voice
that
trembled
a
little
now
and
then
with
an
emotion
that
did
her
credit
with
me
into
the
little
sheltered
valley
of
the
speed
let
us
follow
the
brown
trout
stream
that
goes
purling
through
the
lush
green
grass
of
the
meadows
i
no
idea
said
waddington
it
was
anything
like
so
good
as
it
is
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
on
having
got
rid
of
ralph
bevan
and
in
february
when
the
frost
broke
and
the
spring
weather
came
and
the
green
and
pink
and
purple
fields
showed
up
again
through
the
mist
on
the
hillsides
he
went
out
driving
with
barbara
in
his
car
he
wanted
to
look
again
at
the
places
of
his
and
he
wanted
barbara
to
look
at
them
with
him
it
was
the
reward
he
had
promised
her
for
what
he
called
her
dreary
mechanical
job
of
copying
and
copying
barbara
noticed
the
curious
exalted
expression
of
his
face
as
he
sat
up
beside
her
in
the
car
looking
noble
she
put
it
down
partly
to
that
everlasting
that
made
his
inward
happiness
and
partly
to
sheer
physical
exhilaration
induced
by
speed
she
felt
something
like
it
herself
as
they
tore
switchbacking
up
and
down
the
hills
an
excitement
whipped
up
on
the
top
of
the
deep
happiness
that
came
from
thinking
about
ralph
and
there
was
hardly
a
moment
when
she
think
about
him
it
made
her
eyes
shine
and
her
mouth
quiver
with
a
peculiarly
blissful
smile
and
waddington
looked
at
barbara
where
she
sat
tucked
up
beside
him
he
noticed
the
shining
and
the
quivering
and
he
thought
what
he
always
had
thought
of
barbara
only
now
he
was
certain
the
child
loved
him
she
had
been
fascinated
and
frightened
frightened
and
fascinated
by
him
from
the
first
hour
that
she
had
known
him
but
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
any
more
she
had
left
off
struggling
she
was
giving
herself
up
like
a
child
to
this
feeling
the
nature
of
which
in
her
child
innocence
she
did
not
yet
know
but
he
knew
he
had
always
known
it
so
much
one
half
of
waddington
mind
admitted
while
the
other
half
denied
that
he
had
known
it
with
any
certainty
it
went
on
saying
to
itself
blind
blind
yet
i
might
have
known
it
as
if
he
had
he
had
of
course
kept
it
before
him
as
a
possibility
no
part
of
him
denied
that
and
he
had
used
tact
he
had
handled
a
delicate
situation
with
a
consummate
delicacy
he
had
done
everything
an
honourable
man
could
do
but
there
it
was
there
it
had
been
from
the
day
that
he
had
come
into
the
house
and
found
her
there
and
the
thing
was
too
strong
for
barbara
poor
child
he
might
have
known
it
would
be
and
it
was
too
strong
for
waddington
it
was
his
fault
it
was
fanny
fault
having
the
girl
there
and
forcing
them
to
that
dangerous
intimacy
before
his
illness
waddington
had
resisted
successfully
any
little
inclination
he
might
have
had
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
he
conceived
his
inner
life
for
the
last
nine
months
as
consisting
of
a
series
of
resistances
he
conceived
the
episode
of
elise
as
a
safety
valve
natural
but
unpleasant
for
the
emotions
caused
by
barbara
the
substitution
of
a
permissible
for
an
impermissible
lapse
it
had
been
incredible
to
him
that
he
should
make
love
to
barbara
but
one
effect
of
his
influenza
was
apparent
it
had
lowered
his
resistance
and
lowering
it
had
altered
his
whole
moral
perspective
and
his
scale
of
values
till
one
morning
in
april
walking
with
barbara
in
the
garden
that
smelt
of
wallflowers
and
violets
he
became
aware
that
barbara
was
as
necessary
to
him
as
he
was
to
barbara
her
easel
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
lawn
with
an
unfinished
drawing
of
the
house
on
it
he
paused
before
it
smiling
his
tender
sentimental
smile
there
one
thing
i
regret
barbara
that
i
did
have
your
drawings
for
my
cotswold
book
the
thanks
to
unproclaimed
activities
of
ralph
bevan
were
at
that
moment
in
the
press
why
should
you
she
said
if
you
did
care
about
them
it
inconceivable
that
i
should
have
cared
i
was
blind
blind
well
some
day
if
we
ever
have
an
de
they
shall
appear
in
that
some
day
she
had
the
heart
to
tell
him
that
the
drawings
had
another
destination
for
as
yet
the
existence
of
ralph
took
was
a
secret
they
had
agreed
that
nothing
should
disturb
waddington
pleasure
in
the
publication
of
his
ramblings
his
poor
ramblings
one
has
to
pay
for
blindness
in
this
world
he
said
a
lot
of
people
be
let
in
at
that
rate
i
do
suppose
five
will
care
a
rap
about
my
drawings
i
was
thinking
only
of
your
drawings
my
dear
he
pondered
fanny
tells
me
you
going
to
have
a
birthday
you
quite
a
little
april
girl
are
you
it
was
barbara
birthday
and
the
day
of
her
adoption
it
had
begun
unpropitiously
with
something
very
like
a
dispute
between
horatio
and
fanny
waddington
had
gone
up
to
london
the
day
before
and
had
returned
with
a
pearl
pendant
for
fanny
and
a
green
jade
necklace
for
barbara
not
yet
presented
and
a
canary
yellow
waistcoat
for
himself
and
not
only
the
waistcoat
on
the
birthday
morning
fanny
had
called
out
to
barbara
as
she
passed
her
bedroom
door
barbara
come
here
fanny
was
staring
fascinated
at
four
pairs
of
silk
pyjamas
spread
out
before
her
on
the
bed
remarkable
pyjamas
of
a
fierce
magenta
with
forked
lightning
in
orange
running
about
all
over
them
good
god
fanny
you
may
well
say
god
what
would
you
say
if
you
got
to
i
not
a
nervous
woman
but
it
a
mercy
he
did
get
them
eighteen
years
ago
said
barbara
or
horry
might
have
been
born
an
idiot
yellow
waistcoats
are
all
very
well
said
fanny
but
what
he
have
been
thinking
of
i
do
know
said
barbara
somehow
the
pattern
called
up
irresistibly
the
image
of
levitt
perhaps
she
said
he
thinks
he
jupiter
well
i
not
and
i
do
want
to
be
blasted
so
put
them
somewhere
where
he
ca
find
them
at
that
moment
they
had
heard
waddington
coming
through
his
and
barbara
had
run
away
by
the
door
into
the
corridor
who
took
those
things
out
of
my
wardrobe
he
said
he
was
gazing
dreamily
affectionately
almost
at
the
pyjamas
i
did
and
what
for
to
look
at
them
can
you
wonder
horatio
if
you
wear
them
i
apply
for
a
separation
you
need
worry
there
was
a
queer
look
in
his
face
significant
and
furtive
and
mind
with
one
of
its
rapid
flights
darted
off
from
the
pyjamas
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
barbara
she
said
about
her
yes
you
know
we
were
going
to
adopt
her
if
we
liked
her
enough
and
we
do
like
her
enough
do
we
i
have
no
paternal
feeling
for
barbara
said
waddington
the
parental
relation
does
not
appeal
to
me
as
desirable
or
suitable
i
should
have
thought
considering
her
age
and
your
age
it
was
very
suitable
indeed
not
if
it
entails
obligations
that
i
might
regret
you
going
to
provide
for
her
are
you
that
is
an
obligation
surely
you
regret
i
can
provide
for
her
without
adopting
her
how
it
no
good
just
leaving
her
something
in
your
will
i
shall
continue
half
her
salary
said
waddington
as
an
allowance
yes
but
will
you
give
her
a
marriage
portion
if
she
marries
he
was
silent
his
mind
reeled
with
the
blow
if
she
marries
he
said
with
my
consent
and
my
approval
yes
if
that
is
a
parental
attitude
and
supposing
she
does
she
is
thinking
of
marrying
you
do
know
what
she
thinking
of
neither
i
venture
to
say
do
you
well
i
do
see
how
i
can
adopt
her
if
you
do
i
did
say
i
would
adopt
her
then
you
will
he
snapped
back
at
her
with
an
incredible
ferocity
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
do
me
he
then
lifted
up
the
pyjamas
from
the
bed
and
carried
them
into
his
through
the
open
door
she
saw
him
mounted
on
a
chair
laying
them
out
tenderly
on
the
top
shelf
of
the
wardrobe
as
if
he
were
storing
them
for
some
mysterious
and
romantic
purpose
in
which
fanny
was
not
included
perhaps
after
all
she
thought
he
only
bought
them
because
they
make
him
feel
young
all
the
morning
that
morning
of
barbara
birthday
and
adoption
waddington
thoughtful
gloom
continued
and
in
the
afternoon
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
library
and
gave
orders
that
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
barbara
was
in
the
they
had
given
her
the
for
a
study
and
she
was
alone
in
it
amusing
herself
with
her
pocket
the
was
barbara
and
ralph
secret
sometimes
it
lived
for
days
with
ralph
at
the
white
hart
sometimes
it
lived
with
barbara
in
her
coat
pocket
or
in
her
bureau
under
lock
and
key
she
was
obsessed
with
the
fear
that
some
day
she
would
leave
it
about
and
fanny
would
find
it
or
waddington
or
any
minute
waddington
might
come
on
her
and
catch
her
with
it
it
would
be
awful
if
she
were
caught
for
that
remarkable
collection
contained
several
drawings
of
waddington
and
barbara
added
to
their
number
daily
but
at
the
moment
the
long
interval
between
an
unusually
early
birthday
tea
and
an
unusually
late
birthday
dinner
she
was
safe
fanny
had
gone
over
to
medlicott
in
the
car
waddington
was
tucked
away
in
his
library
reading
in
perfect
innocence
and
simplicity
and
peace
it
was
even
likely
that
ralph
would
turn
up
for
he
had
gone
over
to
oxford
and
it
was
on
his
account
that
the
birthday
dinner
was
put
off
till
eight
there
would
be
hours
and
hours
she
had
just
finished
the
last
of
three
drawings
of
waddington
waddington
standing
up
before
the
long
in
his
new
pyjamas
waddington
appearing
in
the
doorway
of
fanny
bedroom
as
jupiter
with
forked
lightning
out
of
him
into
every
corner
waddington
stooping
to
climb
into
his
bed
a
broad
back
view
with
lightnings
blazing
out
of
it
and
it
was
that
moment
that
waddington
chose
to
come
in
to
present
the
green
jade
necklace
he
was
wearing
his
canary
yellow
waistcoat
barbara
closed
her
hurriedly
and
laid
it
on
the
table
she
kept
one
arm
over
it
while
she
received
and
opened
the
leather
case
where
the
green
necklace
lay
on
its
white
cushion
for
oh
it
too
heavenly
how
awfully
sweet
of
you
do
you
like
it
barbara
i
love
it
compunction
stung
her
when
she
thought
of
her
drawings
especially
the
one
where
he
was
getting
into
bed
she
said
to
herself
i
never
do
it
again
never
again
and
i
wo
show
it
to
ralph
put
it
on
he
commanded
and
let
me
see
you
in
it
she
lifted
it
from
the
case
she
raised
her
arms
and
clasped
it
round
her
neck
she
went
to
the
and
after
the
first
rapt
moment
of
admiration
waddington
possessed
himself
of
the
uncovered
barbara
saw
him
in
the
she
turned
with
a
cry
you
must
you
must
look
at
it
why
not
because
i
do
let
anybody
see
my
sketches
you
let
i
she
dashed
at
him
clutching
his
arm
and
hanging
her
weight
on
it
he
shook
himself
free
and
raised
the
high
above
her
head
she
jumped
up
tearing
at
it
but
his
grip
held
he
delighted
in
his
power
he
laughed
give
it
me
this
instant
she
said
aha
she
got
her
little
secrets
has
she
yes
yes
they
all
there
you
no
business
to
look
at
them
he
caracoled
heavily
dodging
her
attack
enjoying
the
youthful
violence
of
the
struggle
come
he
said
ask
me
nicely
please
then
give
it
me
he
gave
it
bowing
profoundly
over
her
hand
as
she
took
it
i
would
look
into
your
dear
little
secrets
for
the
world
he
said
they
sat
down
amicably
you
let
me
stay
with
you
a
little
while
please
do
wo
you
have
one
of
my
cigarettes
he
took
one
turning
it
in
his
fingers
and
smiling
at
it
a
lingering
sentimental
smile
i
think
i
know
your
secret
he
said
presently
do
you
her
mind
rushed
to
ralph
i
think
so
and
i
think
you
know
mine
yours
yes
mine
we
ca
go
on
living
like
this
so
close
to
each
other
without
knowing
we
may
try
to
keep
things
from
each
other
but
we
ca
i
feel
as
if
you
seen
everything
she
said
to
herself
he
thinking
of
mrs
levitt
i
do
suppose
i
seen
anything
that
matters
she
said
you
seen
what
my
life
is
here
you
ca
have
helped
seeing
that
fanny
and
i
do
hit
it
off
very
well
together
fanny
an
angel
you
dear
little
loyal
thing
yes
she
an
angel
too
much
of
an
angel
for
a
mere
man
i
made
my
grand
mistake
barbara
when
i
married
her
she
does
think
so
anyhow
i
not
so
sure
fanny
knows
she
got
hold
of
something
too
too
big
for
her
what
wrong
with
fanny
is
that
she
ca
grasp
things
she
afraid
of
them
and
she
ca
take
serious
things
seriously
it
no
use
expecting
her
to
i
left
off
expecting
you
do
understand
fanny
one
bit
my
dear
child
i
been
married
to
her
more
than
seventeen
years
and
i
not
a
fool
you
seen
for
yourself
how
she
takes
things
how
she
belittles
everything
with
her
everlasting
laugh
laugh
laugh
in
time
it
gets
on
your
nerves
it
would
said
barbara
if
you
do
see
the
fun
of
it
you
ca
expect
me
to
see
the
fun
of
my
own
funeral
funeral
is
it
as
bad
as
all
that
it
has
been
as
bad
as
all
that
barbara
he
brooded
and
then
you
came
with
your
sweetness
and
your
little
serious
face
my
face
serious
very
to
me
other
people
may
think
you
frivolous
and
amusing
i
daresay
you
are
amusing
to
them
i
hope
so
you
hope
so
because
you
want
to
hide
your
real
self
from
them
but
you
ca
hide
it
from
me
i
seen
it
all
the
time
barbara
are
you
sure
quite
quite
sure
i
wish
i
knew
what
it
looked
like
that
the
beauty
and
charm
of
you
my
dear
that
you
do
know
what
a
nice
waistcoat
you
got
on
said
barbara
he
looked
gratified
i
glad
you
like
it
i
put
it
on
for
your
birthday
you
mean
she
said
my
adoption
day
he
winced
it
good
she
said
of
you
and
fanny
to
adopt
me
but
it
wo
be
for
very
long
and
i
want
to
earn
my
own
living
all
the
same
i
ca
think
of
letting
you
do
that
i
must
it
wo
make
any
difference
to
my
adoption
he
scowled
so
repugnant
to
him
was
this
subject
that
he
judged
it
would
be
equally
distasteful
to
barbara
it
was
fanny
idea
he
said
i
thought
it
would
be
you
did
expect
me
to
have
paternal
feelings
for
you
barbara
i
did
you
to
have
any
feelings
at
all
the
wound
made
him
start
my
poor
child
what
a
terrible
thing
for
you
to
say
why
terrible
because
it
shows
it
shows
and
it
is
true
do
you
suppose
i
know
what
been
going
on
inside
you
i
was
blind
to
myself
my
dear
but
i
saw
through
you
saw
through
me
she
thought
again
of
ralph
through
and
through
i
did
know
i
was
so
transparent
but
i
do
see
that
it
matters
much
if
you
did
he
smiled
at
her
delicious
naivete
no
nothing
matters
nothing
matters
barbara
except
our
caring
at
least
we
wise
enough
to
know
that
i
should
have
thought
she
said
it
would
take
much
wisdom
more
than
you
think
my
child
more
than
you
think
you
only
got
to
be
wise
for
yourself
i
got
to
be
wise
for
both
of
us
she
thought
heavy
parent
that
comes
of
being
adopted
when
it
comes
to
the
point
she
said
one
can
only
be
wise
for
oneself
i
glad
you
see
that
it
makes
it
much
easier
for
me
it
does
you
must
think
you
responsible
for
me
just
because
you
adopted
me
do
talk
to
me
about
adoption
when
you
know
perfectly
well
what
i
did
it
for
why
what
you
do
it
for
to
make
things
safe
for
us
to
keep
fanny
from
knowing
to
keep
myself
from
knowing
barbara
to
keep
you
but
it
too
late
to
camouflage
it
we
know
where
we
stand
now
i
do
think
do
you
do
you
do
waddington
tossed
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
with
a
passionate
gesture
of
abandonment
he
came
to
her
she
saw
his
coming
she
saw
it
chiefly
as
the
approach
of
a
canary
yellow
waistcoat
she
fixed
her
attention
on
the
waistcoat
as
if
it
were
the
centre
of
her
own
mental
equilibrium
there
was
a
bend
in
the
waistcoat
waddington
was
stooping
over
her
with
his
face
peering
into
hers
she
sat
motionless
held
under
his
face
by
curiosity
and
fear
the
whole
phenomenon
seemed
to
her
incredible
too
incredible
as
yet
to
call
for
protest
it
was
as
if
it
were
not
happening
as
if
she
were
merely
waiting
to
see
it
happen
before
she
cried
out
yet
she
was
frightened
this
state
lasted
for
one
instant
the
next
she
was
in
his
arms
his
mouth
thrust
out
under
the
big
rough
moustache
was
running
over
her
face
like
like
while
she
pressed
her
hands
hard
against
the
canary
yellow
waistcoat
pushing
him
off
her
mind
disengaged
itself
from
the
struggle
and
reported
like
a
vacuum
cleaner
that
was
it
vacuum
cleaner
he
gave
back
there
was
no
evil
violence
in
him
and
she
got
on
her
feet
how
could
you
she
cried
how
could
you
be
such
a
perfect
pig
say
that
to
me
barbara
even
in
fun
you
know
you
love
me
i
do
i
do
you
do
you
know
you
do
you
know
you
want
me
to
take
you
in
my
arms
why
be
so
cruel
to
yourself
to
myself
i
kill
myself
before
i
let
you
why
i
kill
you
no
no
no
you
only
think
you
would
you
little
spitfire
he
had
given
back
altogether
and
now
leaned
against
the
chimneypiece
not
beaten
not
abashed
but
smiling
at
her
in
a
triumphant
certitude
for
so
long
the
glamour
of
his
illusion
held
him
nothing
you
can
say
barbara
will
persuade
me
that
you
do
care
for
me
then
you
must
be
mad
mad
as
a
hatter
all
men
go
mad
at
times
you
must
make
allowances
listen
i
wo
listen
i
do
want
to
hear
another
word
she
was
going
he
saw
her
intention
but
he
was
nearer
to
the
door
than
she
was
and
by
a
quick
though
ponderous
movement
he
got
there
first
he
stood
before
her
with
his
back
to
the
door
he
had
the
wild
thought
of
locking
it
but
chivalry
forbade
him
you
can
go
in
a
minute
he
said
but
you
got
to
listen
to
me
first
you
got
to
be
fair
to
me
i
may
be
mad
but
if
i
did
care
for
you
madly
i
would
have
supposed
for
an
instant
that
you
cared
for
me
i
would
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
but
i
i
tell
you
and
i
tell
you
you
do
do
you
suppose
after
all
you
done
for
me
i
have
done
anything
done
look
at
the
way
you
worked
for
me
i
never
known
anything
like
your
devotion
barbara
oh
it
was
only
my
job
was
it
your
job
to
save
me
from
that
horrible
woman
oh
yes
it
was
all
in
the
day
work
my
dear
barbara
no
woman
ever
does
a
day
work
like
that
for
a
man
unless
she
cares
for
him
and
unless
she
wants
him
to
care
for
her
as
it
happens
it
was
fanny
i
cared
for
i
was
thinking
of
fanny
all
the
time
if
think
about
fanny
more
and
about
levitt
and
people
less
it
would
be
a
good
thing
it
too
late
to
think
about
fanny
now
that
only
your
sweetness
and
goodness
please
do
lie
if
you
really
thought
me
sweet
and
good
you
expect
me
to
be
a
substitute
for
mrs
levitt
do
talk
about
levitt
do
you
suppose
i
think
of
you
in
the
same
sentence
that
was
a
different
thing
altogether
was
it
was
it
so
very
different
he
saw
that
she
remembered
it
was
a
man
may
lose
his
head
ten
times
over
without
losing
his
heart
once
if
it
levitt
you
thinking
about
you
can
put
that
out
of
your
mind
for
ever
it
is
only
levitt
there
ralph
bevan
you
forgotten
ralph
bevan
what
has
ralph
bevan
got
to
do
with
it
simply
this
that
i
engaged
to
be
married
to
him
to
be
married
to
be
married
to
ralph
bevan
oh
barbara
why
you
tell
me
ralph
did
want
me
to
till
nearer
the
time
the
time
did
it
come
to
that
it
did
said
barbara
he
moved
from
the
doorway
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
she
might
now
have
gone
out
but
she
did
go
she
to
see
what
he
would
make
of
it
at
his
last
turn
he
faced
her
and
stood
still
poor
child
he
said
so
that
what
i
driven
you
to
amazement
kept
her
silent
sit
down
he
said
we
must
go
through
this
together
amazement
made
her
sit
down
certainly
they
must
go
through
it
to
see
what
he
would
look
like
at
the
end
he
was
unsurpassable
she
miss
him
look
here
barbara
he
spoke
in
a
tone
of
forced
unnatural
calm
i
do
think
you
quite
understand
the
situation
i
sure
you
realize
for
one
moment
how
serious
it
is
i
do
you
must
expect
me
to
take
it
seriously
that
because
you
do
take
yourself
seriously
enough
dear
in
some
ways
you
singularly
humble
i
do
believe
you
really
know
how
deep
this
thing
has
gone
with
me
or
you
would
have
talked
about
levitt
it
life
and
death
barbara
life
and
death
i
make
a
confession
it
was
serious
at
first
it
was
love
at
first
sight
but
it
gone
all
the
deeper
for
that
i
did
know
how
deep
it
was
till
the
other
day
and
i
had
so
much
to
think
of
so
many
claims
fanny
yes
do
forget
fanny
i
am
not
forgetting
her
fanny
is
going
to
mind
as
you
think
she
minds
as
you
would
mind
yourself
if
you
were
in
her
place
things
go
so
deep
with
fanny
as
all
that
and
she
is
going
to
hold
me
against
my
will
she
not
that
sort
listen
now
please
listen
barbara
sat
still
listening
she
would
let
him
go
to
the
end
of
his
tether
i
confess
in
the
beginning
i
had
thought
of
a
divorce
i
could
bear
the
idea
of
going
through
all
that
unpleasantness
but
go
through
it
ten
times
over
rather
than
that
you
should
marry
ralph
bevan
wait
now
before
i
spoke
to
you
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
fanny
to
divorce
me
i
know
she
do
it
your
name
be
allowed
to
appear
the
moment
i
get
her
consent
we
go
off
together
somewhere
italy
or
the
riviera
i
got
everything
planned
everything
ready
i
saw
to
that
when
i
was
in
london
i
bought
everything
she
saw
forked
lightnings
on
a
magenta
waddington
what
are
you
laughing
at
barbara
he
stood
over
her
distressed
was
going
to
treat
him
to
a
fit
of
hysterics
do
laugh
do
be
silly
child
but
barbara
went
on
laughing
with
her
face
in
the
cushions
abandoned
to
her
vision
from
far
up
the
park
they
heard
the
sound
of
hooter
then
the
grinding
of
the
car
with
fanny
in
it
on
the
gravel
outside
barbara
sat
up
suddenly
and
dried
her
eyes
they
stared
at
each
other
the
stare
of
accomplices
come
child
he
said
pull
yourself
together
barbara
got
up
and
looked
in
the
glass
and
saw
the
green
jade
necklace
hanging
on
her
still
she
took
it
off
and
laid
it
on
the
table
beside
the
forgotten
i
think
she
said
you
must
have
meant
this
for
levitt
but
you
may
thank
your
stars
it
only
me
this
time
he
pretended
not
to
hear
her
not
to
see
the
necklace
not
to
know
that
she
was
going
from
him
she
stood
a
moment
with
her
back
to
the
door
facing
him
it
was
her
turn
to
stand
there
and
be
listened
to
waddington
she
said
some
people
might
think
you
wicked
i
only
think
you
funny
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
noble
funny
if
that
your
idea
of
me
you
had
better
marry
ralph
bevan
i
almost
think
i
had
and
she
laughed
again
not
levitt
laughter
gross
with
experience
he
had
borne
that
without
much
pain
girl
laughter
it
was
young
and
innocent
and
pure
and
ten
times
more
cruel
you
do
know
she
said
you
do
know
how
funny
you
are
and
left
him
waddington
took
up
the
necklace
and
kissed
it
he
rubbed
it
against
his
cheek
and
kissed
it
a
slip
of
paper
had
fallen
from
the
table
to
the
floor
he
knew
what
was
written
on
it
from
horatio
bysshe
waddington
to
his
little
april
girl
he
took
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
took
up
the
the
little
thing
he
thought
now
if
it
had
been
for
her
ridiculous
jealousy
of
elise
if
it
had
been
for
fanny
if
it
been
for
the
little
thing
sweetness
and
goodness
her
goodness
she
was
a
saint
a
saint
it
was
barbara
virtue
not
barbara
that
had
repulsed
him
this
was
the
only
credible
explanation
of
her
behaviour
the
only
one
he
could
bear
to
live
with
he
opened
the
it
was
fanny
coming
in
that
instant
who
saved
him
from
the
worst
when
she
had
restored
the
to
its
refuge
in
the
bureau
and
locked
it
in
she
turned
to
him
horatio
she
said
as
ralph
coming
to
dinner
i
better
tell
you
that
he
and
barbara
are
engaged
to
be
married
she
has
told
me
herself
that
child
fanny
is
a
saint
a
little
saint
how
did
you
find
that
out
do
you
think
it
takes
a
saint
to
marry
ralph
i
think
it
takes
a
saint
to
to
marry
ralph
since
you
put
it
that
way
dearest
fanny
i
sorry
but
waddington
and
i
have
had
a
scrap
it
made
things
impossible
and
i
going
to
ralph
he
turn
out
for
me
so
there
wo
be
any
scandal
you
know
how
awfully
i
love
you
that
why
you
forgive
me
if
i
do
come
back
always
your
loving
barbara
i
frightfully
sorry
about
my
birthday
dinner
but
i
do
feel
birthdayish
or
dinnerish
either
i
want
ralph
nothing
but
ralph
that
would
make
fanny
think
it
was
ralph
they
had
quarrelled
about
barbara
put
this
note
on
fanny
then
she
went
up
to
the
white
hart
to
ralph
bevan
she
waited
in
his
till
he
came
back
from
oxford
hallo
old
thing
what
are
doing
here
ralph
do
you
awfully
mind
if
we
do
dine
at
the
manor
if
we
do
why
because
i
left
them
and
i
do
want
to
go
back
do
you
think
i
could
get
a
room
here
what
up
i
had
a
simply
awful
scrap
with
waddy
and
i
ca
stick
it
there
between
us
we
made
it
impossible
what
he
been
up
to
oh
never
mind
he
been
making
love
to
you
if
you
call
it
making
love
the
old
swine
as
he
said
it
he
felt
the
words
and
his
own
fury
fall
short
of
the
fantastic
quality
of
waddington
no
he
is
barbara
felt
it
he
was
simply
more
funny
than
you
can
imagine
he
had
on
a
canary
yellow
waistcoat
in
spite
of
his
fury
he
smiled
i
think
he
bought
it
for
that
oh
barbara
what
he
must
have
looked
like
yes
if
only
you
could
have
seen
him
but
that
the
worst
of
all
his
best
things
they
only
happen
when
you
alone
with
him
you
remember
we
wondered
whether
he
do
it
again
whether
he
go
one
better
yes
ralph
we
little
thought
it
would
be
me
how
he
does
surpass
himself
the
funniest
thing
was
he
thought
i
was
in
love
with
he
did
he
did
because
of
the
way
i
worked
for
him
he
thought
that
proved
it
yes
yes
i
suppose
he
think
it
look
here
he
did
do
anything
did
he
he
kissed
me
was
funny
the
putrid
old
sinner
if
he
so
old
i
wring
his
neck
for
him
no
no
that
all
wrong
it
not
the
way
we
agreed
to
take
him
think
it
funny
enough
if
he
done
it
to
somebody
else
it
pure
accident
that
it
me
no
doubt
that
the
proper
philosophic
view
i
wonder
whether
levitt
takes
it
ralph
it
was
a
bit
like
his
levitt
stunt
the
awful
thing
was
he
really
meant
it
he
planned
it
all
out
we
were
to
go
off
together
to
the
riviera
and
he
was
to
wear
his
canary
waistcoat
did
he
say
that
no
but
you
could
see
he
thought
it
and
he
was
going
to
get
fanny
to
divorce
him
good
god
he
went
as
far
as
that
as
far
as
that
he
was
so
cocksure
you
see
i
afraid
it
been
a
bit
of
a
shock
to
him
well
it
a
thundering
good
thing
i
got
a
job
at
last
you
yes
we
can
get
married
the
day
after
tomorrow
if
we
like
blackadder
given
me
the
editorship
of
the
no
oh
ralph
how
topping
that
what
i
ran
up
to
oxford
for
to
see
him
and
settle
everything
it
a
fairly
decent
screw
the
thing
got
no
end
of
hacking
and
up
to
me
to
make
it
last
i
say
fanny
he
pleased
as
they
were
talking
about
it
the
landlady
of
the
white
hart
came
in
to
tell
them
that
waddington
was
downstairs
and
wanted
to
speak
to
miss
madden
all
right
ralph
said
show
waddington
up
i
clear
out
oh
ralph
what
am
i
to
say
to
her
tell
her
the
truth
if
she
wants
it
she
wo
mind
she
will
frightfully
not
so
frightfully
as
you
think
that
what
said
well
he
right
there
the
old
beast
barbara
said
fanny
when
they
were
alone
together
what
on
earth
has
happened
oh
nothing
we
just
had
a
bit
of
a
tiff
that
all
about
ralph
he
told
me
it
was
ralph
you
might
say
it
was
ralph
he
came
into
it
into
what
oh
the
general
situation
nonsense
horatio
was
making
love
to
you
i
could
see
by
his
face
you
need
mind
telling
me
straight
out
i
seen
it
coming
since
when
i
do
know
it
must
have
begun
long
before
i
saw
it
how
long
do
you
think
oh
before
mrs
levitt
mrs
levitt
she
may
have
been
only
a
safety
valve
that
why
i
made
him
adopt
you
i
thought
it
would
stop
it
in
common
decency
but
it
seems
it
only
brought
it
to
a
head
no
it
was
his
canary
waistcoat
did
that
fanny
the
ghost
of
dead
mirth
rose
up
in
fanny
eyes
you
muddling
cause
and
effect
my
dear
he
was
in
love
because
he
bought
the
waistcoat
he
bought
the
waistcoat
because
he
was
in
love
and
those
other
things
the
romantic
pyjamas
because
he
thought
make
him
look
younger
well
then
said
barbara
it
was
a
vicious
circle
the
waistcoat
put
it
into
his
head
that
afternoon
it
does
much
matter
how
it
happened
i
awfully
sorry
fanny
i
would
have
let
it
happen
for
the
world
if
i
known
it
was
going
to
but
who
could
have
known
my
dear
it
was
your
fault
do
you
mind
frightfully
fanny
looked
away
it
depends
she
said
what
did
you
say
to
him
i
said
a
lot
of
things
but
they
were
a
bit
of
good
then
i
afraid
i
laughed
you
laughed
at
him
i
could
help
it
fanny
he
was
so
funny
oh
fanny
caught
her
breath
back
on
a
sob
that
what
i
ca
bear
barbara
his
being
laughed
at
i
know
said
barbara
by
the
way
when
you
dying
dear
if
you
should
be
dying
at
any
time
it
be
a
consolation
to
you
to
know
that
he
did
see
your
drawings
did
see
them
only
the
one
he
was
looking
at
when
i
came
in
was
it
was
it
the
one
where
he
was
getting
into
bed
no
he
was
only
hunting
god
has
been
kinder
to
me
than
i
deserve
then
he
been
kinder
to
him
too
i
fancy
she
went
on
i
want
you
to
see
this
thing
straight
understand
i
mind
his
being
in
love
with
you
i
knew
he
was
head
over
ears
in
love
and
i
did
mind
a
bit
i
think
he
was
reckoning
on
that
he
knew
you
forgive
him
forgive
him
it
was
even
a
question
of
forgiveness
i
was
i
thought
if
only
he
could
have
one
real
feeling
if
only
he
could
care
for
something
or
somebody
that
was
himself
i
think
he
cared
for
you
barbara
it
was
just
himself
and
i
loved
him
for
it
you
darling
and
you
do
hate
me
you
know
i
do
but
i
love
you
even
more
if
you
loved
him
if
i
loved
him
yes
if
you
gone
away
with
him
and
made
him
happy
if
you
laughed
at
him
barbara
i
know
it
was
awful
of
me
but
what
could
i
do
what
could
you
do
we
all
do
it
i
do
it
levitt
did
it
i
did
do
it
like
mrs
levitt
no
but
you
were
just
one
more
think
of
it
all
his
life
to
be
laughed
at
and
when
he
was
making
love
too
the
most
serious
thing
barbara
that
anybody
can
do
i
tell
you
i
ca
bear
it
i
have
given
him
to
you
ten
times
first
then
said
barbara
you
got
to
forgive
me
if
i
do
it
because
it
my
own
sin
and
i
ca
forgive
myself
besides
i
let
it
happen
because
i
thought
it
would
cure
him
of
falling
in
love
of
trying
to
be
young
when
he
did
feel
it
i
thought
he
see
how
impossible
it
was
but
that
the
sad
part
of
it
he
have
felt
young
barbara
if
you
loved
him
if
i
loved
him
i
could
have
kept
him
young
i
told
you
she
said
it
was
all
my
fault
you
told
me
ralph
and
i
would
never
be
old
is
that
what
you
meant
yes
they
sat
silent
a
moment
looking
down
through
ralph
window
into
the
market
square
and
presently
they
saw
waddington
pass
the
corner
of
the
town
hall
and
cross
the
wide
open
space
to
the
dower
house
you
must
come
back
with
me
barbara
if
you
do
everybody
know
what
happened
i
ca
fanny
he
wo
be
there
you
wo
see
him
till
your
wedding
day
he
going
to
stay
with
granny
he
says
she
is
very
well
i
sorry
she
is
well
she
perfectly
well
that
is
what
he
going
for
across
the
square
they
could
see
the
door
of
the
dower
house
open
and
receive
him
fanny
smiled
he
going
back
to
his
mother
to
be
made
young
again
she
said
