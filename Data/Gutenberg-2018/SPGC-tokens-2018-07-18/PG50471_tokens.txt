everything
in
the
world
said
robin
aunt
matilda
she
said
suddenly
meg
looked
rather
like
a
little
witch
is
this
the
train
to
chicago
said
robin
you
like
a
cup
coffee
she
asked
now
we
are
in
venice
well
jem
she
exclaimed
he
was
looking
at
her
in
an
absent
miserable
way
fair
he
said
tremulously
take
me
with
you
it
s
a
queer
sight
she
said
to
john
holt
two
little
pilgrims
progress
i
the
sun
had
set
and
the
shadows
were
deepening
in
the
big
barn
the
last
red
very
last
bit
which
reached
the
corner
the
children
called
the
straw
died
away
and
meg
drew
her
knees
up
higher
so
as
to
bring
the
pages
of
her
book
nearer
to
her
eyes
as
the
twilight
deepened
and
it
became
harder
to
read
it
was
her
bitterest
grievance
that
this
was
what
always
happened
when
she
became
most
interested
and
light
began
to
fade
away
and
the
shadows
to
fill
all
the
corners
and
close
in
about
her
she
frowned
as
it
happened
fierce
little
frown
which
knitted
her
childish
black
brows
as
she
pored
over
her
book
devouring
the
page
with
the
determination
to
seize
on
as
much
as
was
possible
it
was
like
running
a
desperate
race
with
the
darkness
she
was
a
determined
child
and
no
one
would
have
failed
to
guess
as
much
who
could
have
watched
her
for
a
few
moments
as
she
sat
on
her
curious
perch
her
cheeks
supported
by
her
hands
her
shock
of
straight
black
hair
tumbling
over
her
forehead
the
straw
parlor
was
the
top
of
a
straw
stack
in
aunt
matilda
s
barn
robin
had
discovered
it
one
day
by
climbing
a
ladder
which
had
been
left
leaning
against
the
stack
and
when
he
had
found
himself
on
the
top
of
it
he
had
been
enchanted
by
the
feeling
it
gave
him
of
being
so
high
above
the
world
and
had
called
meg
up
to
share
it
with
him
she
had
been
even
more
enchanted
than
he
they
both
hated
the
world
down
matilda
s
seemed
hideous
and
exasperating
and
sordid
to
them
in
its
contrast
to
the
world
they
had
lived
in
before
their
father
and
mother
had
died
and
they
had
been
sent
to
their
sole
relation
who
did
not
want
them
and
only
took
them
in
from
respect
to
public
opinion
three
years
they
had
been
with
aunt
matilda
and
each
week
had
seemed
more
unpleasant
than
the
last
matilda
jennings
was
a
renowned
female
farmer
of
illinois
and
she
was
far
too
energetic
a
manager
and
business
woman
to
have
time
to
spend
on
children
she
had
an
enormous
farm
and
managed
it
herself
with
a
success
and
ability
which
made
her
celebrated
in
agricultural
papers
if
she
had
not
given
her
dead
brother
s
children
a
home
they
would
have
starved
or
been
sent
to
the
poorhouse
accordingly
she
gave
them
food
to
eat
and
beds
to
sleep
in
but
she
scarcely
ever
had
time
to
notice
them
if
she
had
had
time
to
talk
to
them
she
had
nothing
to
say
she
cared
for
nothing
but
crops
and
new
and
fertilizers
and
they
knew
nothing
about
such
things
she
never
says
anything
but
go
to
bed
keep
out
of
the
she
s
not
like
a
woman
at
all
meg
commented
once
she
s
like
a
man
in
woman
s
their
father
had
been
rather
like
a
woman
in
man
s
clothes
he
was
a
gentle
little
slender
man
with
a
large
head
he
had
always
been
poor
and
matilda
jennings
had
regarded
him
as
a
contemptible
failure
he
had
had
no
faculty
for
business
or
farming
he
had
taught
school
and
married
a
school
teacher
they
had
had
a
small
house
but
somehow
it
had
been
as
cosey
as
it
was
tiny
they
had
managed
to
surround
themselves
with
an
atmosphere
of
books
by
buying
the
cheap
ones
they
could
afford
and
borrowing
the
expensive
ones
from
friends
and
circulating
libraries
the
and
heard
stories
and
read
books
all
the
first
years
of
their
lives
as
they
sat
in
their
little
seats
by
the
small
warm
fireside
in
aunt
matilda
s
bare
cold
house
there
was
not
a
book
to
be
seen
a
few
agricultural
papers
were
scattered
about
meals
were
hurried
over
as
necessary
evils
the
few
people
who
appeared
on
the
scene
were
farmers
who
talked
about
agricultural
implements
and
the
wheat
market
it
s
such
a
bare
place
robin
used
to
say
and
he
would
drive
his
hands
into
the
depths
of
his
pockets
and
set
his
square
little
jaw
and
stare
before
him
both
the
twins
had
that
square
little
jaw
neither
of
them
looked
like
their
father
and
mother
except
that
from
their
mother
they
inherited
black
hair
robin
s
eyes
were
black
but
meg
s
were
gray
with
thick
black
lashes
they
were
handsome
little
creatures
but
their
shocks
of
straight
black
hair
their
straight
black
brows
and
square
little
jaws
made
them
look
curiously
unlike
other
children
they
both
remembered
one
winter
evening
when
as
they
sat
on
their
seat
by
the
fire
their
father
after
looking
at
them
with
a
half
smile
for
a
moment
or
so
began
to
laugh
margaret
he
said
to
their
mother
do
you
know
who
those
two
are
like
you
have
heard
me
speak
of
matilda
often
oh
robert
she
exclaimed
surely
they
are
not
like
matilda
well
perhaps
it
is
too
much
to
say
they
are
like
her
he
answered
but
there
is
something
in
their
faces
that
reminds
me
of
her
strongly
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
exactly
but
it
is
there
it
is
a
good
thing
perhaps
with
a
queer
tone
in
his
voice
matilda
always
did
what
she
made
up
her
mind
to
do
matilda
was
a
success
i
was
always
a
ah
no
bob
she
said
not
a
failure
she
had
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
he
lifted
it
and
pressed
it
against
his
thin
cheek
wasn
t
i
maggie
he
said
gently
wasn
t
i
well
i
think
these
two
will
be
like
matilda
in
making
up
their
minds
and
getting
what
they
before
the
winter
was
over
robin
and
meg
were
orphans
and
were
with
aunt
matilda
and
there
they
had
been
ever
since
until
the
day
they
found
the
straw
parlor
it
had
seemed
as
if
no
corner
in
the
earth
belonged
to
them
meg
slept
on
a
cot
in
a
woman
servant
s
room
robin
shared
a
room
with
some
one
else
nobody
took
any
notice
of
them
when
any
one
meets
us
anywhere
meg
said
they
always
look
surprised
dogs
who
are
not
allowed
in
the
house
are
like
us
the
only
difference
is
that
they
don
t
drive
us
out
but
we
are
just
as
much
in
the
i
know
said
robin
if
it
wasn
t
for
you
meg
i
should
run
where
said
meg
somewhere
said
robin
setting
his
jaw
i
d
find
a
if
it
wasn
t
for
you
said
meg
i
should
be
so
lonely
that
i
should
walk
into
the
river
i
wouldn
t
stand
it
is
worth
noticing
that
she
did
not
say
i
not
stand
but
after
the
day
they
found
the
straw
parlor
they
had
an
it
was
meg
who
preÃ«mpted
it
before
she
had
been
on
the
top
of
the
stack
five
minutes
after
she
had
stumbled
around
looking
about
her
she
stopped
short
and
looked
down
into
the
barn
robin
she
said
this
is
another
world
we
are
miles
and
miles
away
from
aunt
matilda
let
us
make
this
into
our
yours
and
live
we
are
in
nobody
s
will
even
know
where
we
are
said
robin
nobody
ever
asks
you
know
meg
it
will
be
just
like
our
own
we
will
live
and
so
they
did
on
fine
days
when
they
were
tired
of
playing
they
climbed
the
ladder
to
rest
on
the
heap
of
yellow
straw
on
wet
days
they
lay
and
told
each
other
stories
or
built
caves
or
read
their
old
favorite
books
over
again
the
stack
was
a
very
high
one
and
the
roof
seemed
like
a
sort
of
big
tent
above
their
heads
and
the
barn
floor
a
wonderful
exaggeratedly
long
distance
below
the
birds
who
had
nests
in
the
rafters
became
accustomed
to
them
and
one
of
the
children
s
chief
entertainments
was
to
lie
and
watch
the
mothers
and
fathers
carry
on
their
domestic
arrangements
feeding
their
young
ones
and
quarrelling
a
little
sometimes
about
the
way
to
bring
them
up
the
twins
invented
a
weird
little
cry
with
which
they
called
each
other
if
one
was
in
the
straw
parlor
and
the
other
one
entered
the
barn
to
find
out
whether
it
was
occupied
or
not
they
never
mounted
to
the
straw
parlor
or
descended
from
it
if
any
one
was
within
sight
this
was
their
secret
they
wanted
to
feel
that
it
was
very
high
and
far
away
from
aunt
matilda
s
world
and
if
any
one
had
known
where
they
were
or
had
spoken
to
them
from
below
the
charm
would
have
been
broken
this
afternoon
as
meg
pored
over
her
book
she
was
waiting
for
robin
he
had
been
away
all
day
at
twelve
years
old
robin
was
not
of
a
light
mind
when
he
had
been
only
six
years
old
he
had
had
serious
plans
he
had
decided
that
he
would
be
a
great
inventor
he
had
also
little
he
would
not
be
poor
like
his
father
but
would
be
very
rich
he
had
begun
by
having
a
savings
bank
into
which
he
put
rigorously
every
penny
that
was
given
to
him
he
had
been
so
quaintly
systematic
about
it
that
people
were
amused
and
gave
him
pennies
instead
of
candy
and
toys
he
kept
a
little
banking
book
of
his
own
if
he
had
been
stingy
he
would
have
been
a
very
unpleasant
little
boy
but
he
was
only
strict
with
himself
he
was
capable
of
taking
from
his
capital
to
do
the
gentlemanly
thing
by
meg
at
christmas
he
has
the
spirit
of
the
financier
that
is
all
said
his
father
since
he
had
been
with
aunt
matilda
he
had
found
opportunities
to
earn
a
trifle
rather
frequently
on
the
big
place
there
were
small
troublesome
duties
the
farm
hands
found
he
could
be
relied
on
to
do
which
they
were
willing
to
pay
for
they
found
out
that
he
never
failed
them
smart
little
chap
they
said
always
up
to
time
when
he
undertakes
a
he
had
been
steadily
at
work
under
the
head
man
aunt
matilda
had
no
objection
to
his
odd
jobs
he
has
his
living
to
earn
and
he
may
as
well
begin
she
said
so
meg
had
been
alone
since
morning
she
had
only
one
duty
to
perform
and
then
she
was
free
the
first
spring
they
had
been
with
aunt
matilda
robin
had
invested
in
a
few
chickens
and
their
rigorous
care
of
them
had
resulted
in
such
success
that
the
chickens
had
become
a
sort
of
centre
of
existence
to
them
they
could
always
have
any
dreams
of
the
future
upon
the
fortune
to
be
gained
by
chickens
you
could
calculate
on
bits
of
paper
about
chickens
and
eggs
until
your
head
whirled
at
the
magnitude
of
your
prospects
meg
s
duty
was
to
feed
them
and
show
them
scrupulous
attentions
when
robin
was
away
after
she
had
attended
to
them
she
went
to
the
barn
and
finding
it
empty
climbed
up
to
the
straw
parlor
with
an
old
pilgrim
s
progress
to
spend
the
day
this
afternoon
when
the
light
began
to
redden
and
then
to
die
away
she
and
christian
were
very
near
the
gates
she
longed
so
to
go
in
with
him
and
was
yearning
towards
them
with
breathless
eagerness
when
she
heard
robin
s
cry
below
coming
up
from
the
barn
floor
she
sprang
up
with
a
start
feeling
bewildered
a
second
before
she
answered
the
city
beautiful
was
such
millions
of
miles
away
from
aunt
matilda
s
barn
she
found
herself
breathing
quickly
and
rubbing
her
eyes
as
she
heard
robin
hurrying
up
the
ladder
somehow
she
felt
as
if
he
was
rather
in
a
hurry
and
when
his
small
black
shock
head
and
black
eyes
appeared
above
the
straw
she
had
a
vague
feeling
that
he
was
excited
and
that
he
had
come
from
another
world
he
clambered
on
to
the
stack
and
made
his
way
to
her
and
threw
himself
full
length
on
the
straw
at
her
side
meg
he
hallo
you
look
as
if
you
were
in
a
dream
wake
up
and
jerry
are
coming
to
the
hurried
to
get
here
before
them
they
re
talking
about
something
i
want
you
to
new
wake
up
oh
robin
said
meg
clutching
her
book
and
coming
back
to
earth
with
a
sigh
i
don
t
want
to
hear
jones
and
jerry
i
don
t
want
to
hear
any
of
the
people
down
there
i
ve
been
reading
the
pilgrim
s
progress
and
i
do
do
so
there
a
city
robin
gave
a
queer
little
laugh
he
really
was
excited
there
is
going
to
be
one
he
said
jones
and
jerry
don
t
really
know
it
but
it
is
something
like
that
they
are
talking
about
a
city
real
this
earth
and
not
a
hundred
miles
away
let
s
get
near
the
edge
and
ii
they
drew
as
near
to
the
edge
as
they
could
without
being
seen
they
did
not
understand
in
the
least
robin
was
not
given
to
practical
jokes
but
what
he
had
said
sounded
rather
as
if
there
was
a
joke
somewhere
but
she
saw
jones
and
jerry
enter
the
barn
and
saw
before
they
entered
that
they
were
deep
in
talk
it
was
jones
who
was
speaking
jones
was
aunt
matilda
s
head
man
and
was
an
authority
on
many
things
there
s
been
exhibitions
and
fairs
all
over
the
world
he
was
saying
but
there
s
been
nothing
like
what
this
will
be
it
will
be
a
city
that
s
what
it
will
be
and
all
the
world
is
going
to
be
in
it
they
are
going
to
build
it
fronting
on
the
water
and
bank
the
water
up
into
lakes
and
canals
and
build
places
like
white
palaces
beside
them
and
decorate
the
grounds
with
statues
and
palms
and
flowers
and
fountains
and
there
s
not
a
country
on
earth
that
won
t
send
things
to
fill
the
buildings
and
there
won
t
be
anything
a
man
can
t
see
by
going
through
em
it
ll
be
as
good
as
a
college
course
to
spend
a
week
meg
drew
a
little
closer
to
robin
in
the
straw
what
are
they
talking
about
she
whispered
listen
said
bob
jerry
who
was
moving
about
at
some
work
below

a
chuckling
laugh
trust

him
full
credit
and
she
s
goin
to
give
him
a
that
ll
be
a
credit
to
robin
smothered
a
little
laugh
in
his
he
was
quite
used
to
hearing
jokes
about
chicago
the
people
in
the
country
round
it
were
enormously
proud
of
it
and
its
great
schemes
and
great
buildings
and
but
those
who
were
given
to
jokes
had
the
habit
of
being
jocular
about
it
just
as
they
had
the
habit
of
proclaiming
and
dwelling
upon
its
rush
and
wealth
and
enterprise
but
meg
was
not
a
jocular
person
she
was
too
intense
and
easily
excited
she
gave
robin
an
impatient
nudge
with
her
elbow
not
in
reproof
but
as
a
sort
of
irrepressible
ejaculation
i
wish
they
wouldn
t
be
funny
she
exclaimed
i
want
them
to
tell
more
about
it
i
wish
they
d
go
but
they
did
not
go
on
at
least
not
in
any
way
that
was
satisfactory
they
only
remained
in
the
barn
a
short
time
longer
and
they
were
busy
with
the
work
they
had
come
to
do
meg
craned
her
neck
and
listened
but
they
did
not
tell
more
and
she
was
glad
when
they
went
away
so
that
she
could
turn
to
robin
don
t
you
know
more
than
that
she
said
is
it
true
what
have
you
heard
tell
me
i
ve
heard
a
lot
said
robin
they
were
all
talking
about
it
all
the
time
and
i
meant
to
tell
you
myself
only
i
saw
jones
and
jerry
coming
and
thought
perhaps
we
should
hear
something
more
if
we
they
clambered
over
to
their
corner
and
made
themselves
comfortable
robin
lay
on
his
back
but
meg
leaned
on
her
elbows
as
usual
with
her
cheeks
resting
on
her
hands
her
black
hung
over
her
forehead
and
her
big
eyes
shone
rob
she
said
go
on
what
s
the
rest
the
rest
he
said
it
would
take
a
week
to
tell
it
all
i
should
think
but
it
s
going
to
be
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
they
are
going
to
build
a
place
that
will
be
like
a
white
beautiful
city
on
the
borders
of
the
was
why
i
called
it
the
city
beautiful
it
won
t
be
on
the
top
of
a
hill
of
but
if
it
is
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
the
sun
shines
and
the
big
water
is
blue
and
there
are
shining
white
palaces
it
will
be
better
i
believe
said
meg
what
is
going
to
be
in
the
city
everything
in
the
world
said
robin
things
from
every
there
are
a
great
many
countries
said
meg
you
know
how
it
is
in
the
geography
europe
asia
and
africa
as
well
as
america
spain
and
portugal
and
france
and
sweden
and
norway
and
russia
and
switzerland
and
all
the
there
will
be
from
them
all
i
heard
them
say
so
they
say
there
will
be
villages
with
people
walking
about
in
illustration
everything
in
the
world
said
robin
do
they
walk
about
when
they
are
at
home
exclaimed
meg
yes
in
the
queer
clothes
they
wear
in
their
own
countries
there
s
going
to
be
an
esquimaux
with
dogs
and
sledges
cried
meg
lifting
her
head
yes
and
you
know
that
place
in
italy
where
the
streets
are
made
of
it
s
venice
said
meg
and
they
go
about
in
boats
called
and
the
men
who
take
them
about
are
called
gondoliers
interrupted
robin
and
they
have
scarfs
and
red
caps
and
push
their
boats
along
with
poles
there
will
be
gondolas
at
the
fair
and
people
can
get
into
them
and
go
about
the
just
as
they
do
in
venice
meg
gasped
just
as
they
do
in
venice
and
it
will
be
the
same
with
all
the
other
countries
it
will
be
as
if
they
were
all
brought
places
and
egyptian
places
and
german
french
and
italian
and
irish
and
scotch
and
all
the
to
go
there
would
be
like
travelling
all
over
the
world
cried
meg
yes
said
rob
excitedly
and
all
the
trades
will
be
there
and
all
the
scientific
wonderful
everything
any
one
wants
to
learn
about
in
all
the
world
in
his
excitement
his
words
had
become
so
rapid
that
they
almost
tumbled
over
each
other
and
he
said
the
last
sentence
in
a
rush
there
were
red
spots
on
his
cheeks
and
a
queer
look
in
his
black
eyes
he
had
been
listening
to
descriptions
of
this
thing
all
day
a
new
hand
hot
from
the
excitement
in
chicago
had
been
among
the
workers
apparently
he
had
heard
of
nothing
else
thought
of
nothing
else
talked
of
nothing
else
and
dreamed
of
nothing
else
but
the
world
s
fair
for
weeks
finding
himself
among
people
who
had
only
bucolic
and
vague
ideas
about
it
he
had
poured
forth
all
he
knew
and
being
a
rather
good
talker
had
aroused
great
excitement
robin
had
listened
with
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
he
was
a
young
human
being
born
so
full
of
energy
and
enterprise
that
the
dull
prosaic
emptiness
of
his
life
in
aunt
matilda
s
world
had
been
more
horrible
than
he
had
been
old
enough
to
realize
he
could
not
have
explained
why
it
had
seemed
so
maddening
to
him
but
the
truth
was
that
in
his
small
boyish
body
was
imprisoned
the
force
and
ability
which
in
manhood
build
great
schemes
and
not
only
build
but
carry
them
out
in
him
was
imprisoned
one
of
the
great
business
men
inventors
or
political
powers
of
the
new
century
but
of
this
he
knew
nothing
and
so
ate
his
young
heart
out
in
aunt
matilda
s
world
sought
refuge
with
meg
in
the
straw
parlor
and
was
bitterly
miserable
and
at
a
loss
how
he
had
drunk
in
every
word
the
man
from
chicago
had
uttered
how
he
had
edged
near
to
him
and
tried
not
to
lose
him
for
a
moment
how
he
had
longed
for
meg
to
listen
with
him
and
had
hoarded
up
every
sentence
if
he
had
not
been
a
man
in
embryo
and
a
strong
and
creature
he
would
have
done
his
work
badly
but
he
never
did
his
work
badly
he
held
on
like
a
little
bulldog
and
thought
of
what
meg
would
say
when
they
sat
in
the
straw
together
small
wonder
that
he
looked
excited
when
his
black
head
appeared
above
the
edge
of
the
straw
he
was
wrought
up
to
the
highest
pitch
small
wonder
that
there
were
deep
red
spots
on
his
cheeks
and
that
there
was
a
queer
intense
look
in
his
eyes
and
about
his
obstinate
little
mouth
he
threw
up
his
arms
with
a
desperate
gesture
he
said
again
staring
straight
before
him
that
any
one
could
want
to
learn
in
all
the
oh
robin
said
meg
in
quite
a
fierce
little
voice
and
shall
never
see
it
she
saw
robin
clinch
his
hands
though
he
said
nothing
and
it
made
her
clinch
her
own
hands
robin
s
were
tough
little
fists
brown
and
muscular
meg
s
hands
were
flexible
and
slender
but
they
made
good
little
fists
when
they
doubled
themselves
up
rob
she
said
we
never
see
anything
we
never
hear
anything
we
never
learn
anything
if
something
doesn
t
happen
we
shall
be
s
what
we
shall
and
she
struck
her
fist
upon
the
straw
rob
s
jaw
began
to
look
very
square
but
he
did
not
speak
we
are
twelve
years
old
meg
went
on
we
ve
been
here
three
years
and
we
don
t
know
one
thing
we
didn
t
know
when
we
came
here
if
we
had
been
with
father
and
mother
we
should
have
been
learning
things
all
the
time
we
haven
t
one
thing
of
our
own
rob
but
the
chickens
and
the
straw
the
straw
parlor
might
be
taken
away
from
rob
s
square
jaw
relaxed
just
sufficiently
to
allow
of
a
grim
little
grin
we
ve
got
the
treasure
meg
he
said
meg
s
laugh
had
rather
a
hysterical
sound
that
she
should
not
have
mentioned
the
treasure
among
their
belongings
was
queer
they
talked
so
much
about
the
treasure
at
this
moment
it
was
buried
in
an
iron
bank
deep
in
the
straw
about
four
feet
from
where
they
sat
it
was
the
very
bank
robin
had
hoarded
his
savings
in
when
he
had
begun
at
six
years
old
with
pennies
and
a
to
keep
his
accounts
in
everything
they
had
owned
since
then
had
been
pushed
and
dropped
into
the
chicken
and
egg
money
and
all
robin
had
earned
by
doing
odd
jobs
for
any
one
who
would
give
him
one
nobody
knew
about
the
old
iron
bank
any
more
than
they
knew
about
the
straw
parlor
and
the
children
having
buried
it
in
the
straw
called
it
the
treasure
meg
s
stories
about
it
were
numerous
and
wonderful
sometimes
magicians
came
and
multiplied
it
a
sometimes
robbers
stole
it
and
they
themselves
gave
chase
and
sought
it
with
wild
adventure
but
perhaps
the
most
satisfactory
thing
was
to
invent
ways
to
spend
it
when
it
had
grown
to
enormous
proportions
sometimes
they
bought
a
house
in
new
york
and
lived
there
together
sometimes
they
traded
in
foreign
lands
with
it
sometimes
they
bought
land
which
increased
in
value
to
such
an
extent
that
they
were
millionaires
in
a
month
ah
it
was
a
treasure
indeed
after
the
little
low
laugh
meg
folded
her
arms
on
the
straw
and
hid
her
face
in
them
robin
looked
at
her
with
a
troubled
air
for
about
a
minute
then
he
spoke
to
her
it
s
no
use
doing
that
he
said
it
s
no
use
doing
anything
meg
answered
her
voice
muffled
in
her
arms
i
don
t
want
to
do
this
any
more
than
you
do
we
re
so
lonely
yes
we
re
lonely
said
robin
that
s
a
and
he
stared
up
at
the
dark
rafters
above
him
and
at
some
birds
who
were
clinging
to
them
and
twittering
about
a
nest
i
said
i
wished
there
was
a
city
beautiful
meg
said
but
it
seems
to
make
it
worse
that
there
is
going
to
be
something
like
it
so
near
and
that
we
should
never
get
any
nearer
to
it
than
a
hundred
rob
sat
up
and
locked
his
hands
together
round
his
knees
how
do
you
know
he
said
how
do
i
know
cried
meg
desperately
and
she
lifted
her
head
turning
her
wet
face
sideways
to
look
at
him
he
unlocked
his
hands
to
give
his
forehead
a
hard
rub
as
if
he
were
trying
either
to
rub
some
thought
out
of
or
into
it
just
because
we
are
lonely
there
use
in
doing
things
he
said
there
s
nobody
to
do
them
for
us
at
any
rate
we
ve
got
as
far
on
the
way
to
the
city
as
the
bottom
of
the
hill
of
and
he
gave
his
forehead
another
rub
and
looked
straight
before
him
and
meg
drew
a
little
closer
to
him
on
the
straw
and
the
family
of
birds
filled
the
silence
with
domestic
twitters
iii
during
the
weeks
that
followed
they
spent
more
time
than
ever
in
their
they
had
an
absorbing
topic
of
conversation
a
new
and
wonderful
thing
better
than
their
old
books
even
better
than
the
stories
meg
made
when
she
lay
on
the
straw
her
elbows
supporting
her
her
cheeks
on
her
hands
and
her
gray
eyes
staring
into
space
hers
were
always
good
stories
full
of
palaces
and
knights
and
robber
chiefs
and
fairies
but
this
new
thing
had
the
thrill
of
being
a
fairy
story
which
was
real
that
one
could
read
about
it
in
the
newspapers
and
everybody
was
talking
about
it
even
aunt
matilda
her
neighbors
and
the
on
the
farm
to
the
two
lonely
children
in
their
high
nest
in
the
it
seemed
a
curious
thing
to
hear
these
people
in
the
world
below
talk
about
it
in
their
ordinary
everyday
way
without
excitement
or
awe
as
if
it
was
a
new
kind
of
big
ploughing
or
winnowing
machine
to
them
it
was
a
thing
so
beautiful
that
they
could
scarcely
find
the
words
to
express
their
thoughts
and
dreams
about
it
and
yet
they
were
never
alone
together
without
trying
to
do
so
on
wet
cheerless
days
in
which
they
huddled
close
together
in
their
nest
to
keep
from
being
chilled
it
was
their
comfort
to
try
to
imagine
and
paint
pictures
of
the
various
wonders
until
in
their
interest
they
forgot
the
dampness
of
the
air
and
felt
the
unending
patter
of
the
on
the
barn
roof
merely
a
pleasant
sort
of
accompaniment
to
the
stories
of
their
fancies
since
the
day
when
they
had
listened
to
jones
and
jerry
joking
down
below
them
in
the
barn
rob
had
formed
the
habit
of
collecting
every
scrap
of
newspaper
relating
to
the
wonder
he
cut
paragraphs
out
of
aunt
matilda
s
newspapers
he
begged
them
from
the
and
from
the
country
anything
in
the
form
of
an
illustration
he
held
as
a
treasure
beyond
price
and
hoarded
it
to
bring
to
meg
with
exultant
joy
how
they
pored
over
these
things
reading
the
paragraphs
again
and
again
until
they
knew
them
almost
by
heart
how
they
studied
the
pictures
trying
to
gather
the
proportions
and
color
of
every
column
and
dome
and
arch
what
enthusiast
living
in
chicago
itself
knew
the
marvel
as
they
did
and
so
dwelt
on
and
revelled
in
its
beauties
no
one
knew
of
their
pleasure
like
the
straw
parlor
it
was
their
secret
the
strangeness
of
their
lives
lay
in
the
fact
that
absolutely
no
one
knew
anything
about
them
at
all
or
asked
anything
thinking
it
quite
sufficient
that
their
friendlessness
was
supplied
with
enough
animal
heat
and
nourishment
to
keep
their
bodies
alive
of
that
other
part
of
restless
growing
young
brains
and
naturally
craving
hearts
which
in
their
own
poor
enough
but
still
human
little
home
had
at
least
been
recognized
and
cared
matilda
knew
nothing
and
indeed
had
never
given
a
thought
to
it
she
had
not
undertaken
the
care
of
intelligences
and
affections
her
own
were
not
of
an
order
to
require
supervision
she
was
too
much
occupied
with
her
farm
and
the
amazing
things
she
was
doing
with
it
that
the
children
could
read
and
write
and
understood
some
arithmetic
she
knew
she
had
learned
no
more
herself
and
had
found
it
enough
to
build
her
fortune
upon
she
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
feel
lonely
and
neglected
because
she
was
a
person
quite
free
from
affections
and
quite
enough
for
herself
she
never
suspected
that
others
could
suffer
from
a
weakness
of
which
she
knew
nothing
because
it
had
never
touched
her
if
any
one
had
told
her
that
these
two
children
who
ate
her
plentiful
rough
meals
at
her
table
among
and
servants
were
neglected
and
lonely
and
that
their
dim
knowledge
of
it
burned
in
their
childish
minds
she
would
have
thought
the
announcement
a
piece
of
idle
sentimental
folly
but
that
no
solid
detail
of
her
farming
was
a
fact
more
real
than
this
one
was
the
grievous
truth
when
we
were
at
home
was
meg
s
of
the
situation
at
least
we
belonged
to
somebody
we
were
poor
and
wore
our
clothes
a
long
time
and
had
shabby
shoes
and
couldn
t
go
on
excursions
but
we
had
our
little
bench
by
the
fire
and
father
and
mother
used
to
talk
to
us
and
let
us
read
their
books
and
papers
and
try
to
teach
us
things
i
don
t
know
what
we
were
going
to
be
when
we
grew
up
but
we
were
going
to
do
some
sort
of
work
and
know
as
much
as
father
and
mother
did
i
don
t
know
whether
that
was
a
great
deal
or
not
but
it
was
it
was
enough
to
teach
school
said
robin
if
we
were
not
so
far
out
in
the
country
now
i
believe
aunt
matilda
would
let
us
go
to
school
if
we
asked
her
it
wouldn
t
cost
her
anything
if
we
went
to
the
public
she
wouldn
t
if
we
didn
t
ask
her
said
meg
she
would
never
think
of
it
herself
do
you
know
what
i
was
thinking
yesterday
i
was
looking
at
the
pigs
in
their
sty
some
of
them
were
eating
and
one
was
full
and
was
lying
down
going
to
sleep
and
i
said
to
myself
robin
and
i
are
just
like
you
we
live
just
like
you
we
eat
our
food
and
go
to
bed
and
get
up
again
and
eat
some
more
food
we
don
t
learn
anything
more
than
you
do
and
we
are
not
worth
as
much
to
anybody
we
are
not
even
worth
killing
at
if
they
had
never
known
any
other
life
or
if
nature
had
not
given
them
the
big
questioning
eyes
and
square
little
jaws
and
strong
nervous
little
fists
they
might
have
been
content
to
sink
into
careless
idleness
and
apathy
no
one
was
actively
unkind
to
them
they
had
their
straw
parlor
and
were
free
to
amuse
themselves
as
they
chose
but
they
had
been
made
of
the
material
of
which
the
world
s
workers
are
built
and
their
young
hearts
were
full
of
a
restlessness
and
longing
whose
full
significance
they
themselves
did
not
comprehend
and
this
wonder
working
in
the
world
beyond
huge
beautiful
marvel
planned
by
the
human
brain
and
carried
out
by
mere
human
hands
this
great
thing
with
which
all
the
world
seemed
to
them
to
be
throbbing
and
which
seemed
to
set
no
limit
to
itself
and
prove
that
there
was
no
limit
to
the
power
of
human
wills
and
filled
them
with
a
passion
of
restlessness
and
yearning
greater
than
they
had
ever
known
before
it
is
an
enchanted
thing
you
know
s
an
enchanted
thing
meg
said
one
day
looking
up
from
her
study
of
some
newspaper
clippings
and
a
magazine
with
some
pictures
in
it
it
seems
like
it
said
robin
i
m
sure
it
s
enchanted
meg
went
on
it
seems
so
tremendous
that
people
should
think
they
could
do
such
huge
things
as
if
they
felt
as
if
they
could
do
anything
or
bring
anything
from
anywhere
in
the
world
it
almost
frightens
me
sometimes
because
it
reminds
me
of
the
tower
of
babel
don
t
you
remember
how
the
people
got
so
proud
that
they
thought
they
could
do
anything
and
they
began
to
build
the
tower
that
was
to
reach
to
heaven
and
then
they
all
woke
up
one
morning
and
found
they
were
all
speaking
different
languages
and
could
not
understand
each
other
suppose
everybody
was
suddenly
struck
like
that
some
morning
mean
the
fair
people
widening
her
eyes
with
a
little
shiver
they
won
t
be
said
rob
those
things
have
stopped
yes
they
have
said
meg
sometimes
i
wish
they
hadn
t
if
they
hadn
t
if
we
made
burnt
offerings
we
might
be
taken
by
a
miracle
to
see
the
world
s
we
haven
t
anything
to
burn
said
rob
rather
gloomily
we
ve
got
the
chickens
meg
answered
as
gloomily
but
it
wouldn
t
do
any
good
miracles
are
the
world
is
all
different
said
robin
you
have
to
do
your
miracle
it
will
be
a
miracle
meg
said
if
we
ever
get
away
from
aunt
matilda
s
world
and
live
like
people
instead
of
like
pigs
who
are
we
shall
have
to
perform
it
there
is
no
one
else
said
robin
you
see
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
he
threw
out
his
hand
and
it
clutched
meg
s
which
was
lying
in
the
straw
near
him
he
did
not
know
why
he
clutched
did
not
in
the
least
know
why
nor
did
she
know
why
a
queer
sound
in
his
voice
suddenly
made
her
feel
their
unfriendedness
in
a
way
that
overwhelmed
her
she
found
herself
looking
at
him
with
a
hard
lump
rising
in
her
throat
it
was
one
of
the
rainy
days
and
the
hollow
drumming
and
patter
of
the
big
drops
on
the
roof
seemed
somehow
to
shut
them
in
with
their
loneliness
away
from
all
the
world
it
s
a
strange
thing
she
said
almost
under
her
breath
to
be
two
children
only
just
twelve
years
old
and
to
be
quite
by
ourselves
in
such
a
big
world
where
there
are
such
millions
and
millions
of
people
all
busy
doing
things
and
making
great
plans
and
none
of
them
knowing
about
us
or
caring
what
we
are
going
to
if
we
work
our
miracle
ourselves
said
rob
holding
her
hand
quite
tight
it
will
be
better
than
having
it
worked
for
us
meg
if
he
were
beginning
a
new
meg
what
she
answered
still
feeling
the
hard
lump
in
her
throat
do
you
think
we
are
going
to
stay
here
always
robin
i
don
t
well
i
do
then
we
are
that
s
the
first
step
up
the
hill
of
iv
all
their
lives
the
children
had
acted
in
unison
when
they
had
been
tiny
creatures
they
had
played
the
same
games
and
used
the
same
toys
it
had
seemed
of
little
importance
that
their
belongings
were
those
of
a
boy
and
girl
when
robin
had
played
with
tops
and
marbles
meg
had
played
with
them
too
when
meg
had
been
in
a
domestic
and
maternal
mood
and
had
turned
to
dolls
and
dolls
housekeeping
robin
had
assumed
some
masculine
rÃ´le
connected
with
the
amusement
it
had
entertained
him
as
much
at
times
to
be
the
dolls
doctor
or
the
carpenter
who
repaired
the
dolls
furniture
or
made
plans
for
the
enlargement
of
the
dolls
house
as
it
had
entertained
meg
to
sew
the
flags
and
dress
the
sailors
who
manned
his
miniature
ships
and
assist
him
with
the
tails
of
his
kites
they
had
had
few
playmates
and
had
pleased
each
other
far
better
than
outsiders
could
have
done
it
s
because
we
are
twins
meg
said
twins
are
made
alike
and
so
they
like
the
same
things
i
m
glad
i
m
a
twin
if
i
had
to
be
born
again
and
be
an
i
m
sure
i
should
be
i
don
t
think
it
matters
whether
you
are
a
boy
or
a
girl
if
you
are
a
twin
said
robin
you
are
part
of
the
other
one
and
so
it
s
as
if
you
were
they
had
never
had
secrets
from
each
other
they
had
read
the
same
books
as
they
grew
older
been
thrilled
by
the
same
stories
and
shared
in
each
other
s
plans
and
imaginings
or
depressions
so
it
was
a
curious
thing
that
at
this
special
time
when
they
were
drawn
nearest
to
one
another
by
an
unusual
interest
and
sympathy
there
should
have
arrived
a
morning
when
each
rose
with
a
thought
unshared
by
the
other
aunt
matilda
was
very
busy
that
day
she
was
always
busy
but
this
morning
seemed
more
actively
occupied
than
usual
she
never
appeared
to
sit
down
unless
to
dispose
of
a
hurried
meal
or
go
over
some
accounts
she
was
a
wonderful
woman
and
the
twins
knew
that
the
most
objectionable
thing
they
could
do
was
not
to
remove
themselves
after
a
repast
was
over
but
this
morning
meg
walked
over
to
a
chair
and
firmly
sat
down
in
it
and
watched
her
as
she
vigorously
moved
things
about
rubbed
dust
off
them
and
put
them
in
their
right
places
meg
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
very
steadily
she
wondered
if
it
was
true
that
she
and
robin
were
like
her
and
if
they
would
be
more
like
her
when
they
had
reached
her
age
and
what
would
have
happened
to
them
before
that
time
came
it
was
true
that
aunt
matilda
had
a
square
jaw
also
it
was
not
an
encouraging
thing
to
contemplate
in
fact
as
she
looked
at
her
meg
felt
her
heart
begin
a
slow
and
steady
thumping
but
as
it
thumped
she
was
getting
herself
in
hand
with
such
determination
that
when
she
at
last
spoke
her
chin
looked
very
square
indeed
and
her
eyes
were
as
nearly
stern
as
a
child
s
eyes
can
look
aunt
matilda
she
said
suddenly
well
and
a
tablecloth
was
whisked
off
and
shaken
i
want
to
talk
to
talk
in
a
hurry
then
i
ve
no
time
to
waste
in
how
old
were
you
when
you
began
to
work
and
make
money
aunt
matilda
smiled
grimly
i
worked
out
for
my
board
when
i
was
ten
years
old
she
said
me
and
your
father
were
left
orphans
and
we
had
to
work
or
starve
when
i
was
twelve
i
got
a
place
to
wash
dishes
and
look
after
children
and
run
errands
and
i
got
a
dollar
a
week
because
it
was
out
in
the
country
and
girls
wouldn
t
stay
do
you
know
how
old
am
asked
meg
i
ve
i
m
twelve
years
she
got
up
from
her
chair
and
walked
across
the
room
and
stood
looking
up
at
aunt
matilda
i
m
an
orphan
too
and
so
is
robin
she
said
and
we
have
to
work
you
give
us
a
place
to
stay
in
are
other
things
we
have
no
one
and
we
have
to
do
things
ourselves
and
we
are
twelve
and
twelve
is
a
good
age
for
people
who
have
to
do
things
for
themselves
is
there
anything
in
this
house
or
in
the
dairy
or
on
the
farm
that
would
be
worth
wages
that
i
could
do
i
don
t
care
how
hard
it
is
if
i
can
do
if
aunt
matilda
had
been
a
woman
of
sentiment
she
might
have
been
moved
by
the
odd
unchildish
tenseness
and
sternness
of
the
little
figure
and
the
eyes
which
looked
up
at
her
from
under
the
thick
black
hair
tumbling
in
short
locks
over
the
forehead
twelve
years
old
was
very
young
to
stand
and
stare
the
world
in
the
face
with
such
eyes
but
she
was
not
a
woman
of
sentiment
and
her
life
had
been
spent
among
people
who
knew
their
right
to
live
could
only
be
won
by
hard
work
and
who
began
the
fight
early
so
she
looked
at
the
child
without
any
emotion
whatever
do
you
suppose
you
could
more
than
earn
your
bread
if
i
put
you
in
the
dairy
and
let
you
help
there
she
said
yes
answered
meg
unflinchingly
i
know
i
could
i
m
strong
for
my
age
and
i
ve
watched
them
doing
things
there
i
can
wash
pans
and
bowls
and
cloths
and
carry
things
about
and
go
anywhere
i
m
told
i
know
how
clean
things
have
to
be
illustration
aunt
matilda
she
said
suddenly
well
said
aunt
matilda
looking
her
over
sharply
they
ve
been
complaining
about
the
work
being
too
much
for
them
lately
you
go
in
there
this
morning
and
see
what
you
can
do
you
shall
have
a
dollar
a
week
if
you
re
worth
it
you
re
right
about
its
being
time
that
you
should
begin
earning
thank
you
ma
am
said
meg
and
she
turned
round
and
walked
away
in
the
direction
of
the
dairy
with
two
deep
red
spots
on
her
cheeks
and
her
heart
thumping
this
time
it
thumped
quickly
she
reached
the
scene
of
action
in
the
midst
of
a
rush
of
work
and
after
their
first
rather
exasperated
surprise
at
so
immature
and
inexperienced
a
creature
being
supposed
to
be
able
to
help
them
the
women
found
plenty
for
her
to
do
she
said
so
few
words
and
looked
so
little
afraid
that
she
made
a
sort
of
impression
on
them
see
she
said
to
the
head
woman
aunt
matilda
didn
t
send
me
to
do
things
that
need
teaching
just
tell
me
the
little
things
it
does
not
matter
what
and
i
ll
do
them
i
how
she
worked
that
she
ran
on
she
carried
this
and
she
washed
and
scrubbed
how
all
her
tasks
were
menial
and
apparently
trivial
though
entirely
necessary
and
how
the
activity
and
rapidity
and
unceasingness
of
them
tried
her
unaccustomed
young
body
and
finally
made
her
limbs
ache
and
her
back
feel
as
if
it
might
break
at
some
unexpected
moment
meg
never
forgot
but
such
was
the
desperation
of
her
indomitable
little
spirit
and
the
unconquerable
will
she
had
been
born
with
that
when
it
was
over
she
was
no
more
in
the
mood
for
giving
up
than
she
had
been
when
she
walked
in
among
the
workers
after
her
interview
with
aunt
matilda
when
came
she
walked
up
to
macartney
the
manager
of
the
dairy
work
and
asked
her
a
question
have
i
helped
you
she
said
yes
you
have
said
the
woman
who
was
by
no
means
an
creature
for
a
woman
you
ve
done
will
you
tell
aunt
matilda
that
said
meg
yes
was
the
answer
meg
was
standing
with
her
hands
clasped
tightly
behind
her
back
and
she
looked
at
macartney
very
straight
and
hard
from
under
her
black
brows
mrs
macartney
she
said
if
i
m
worth
it
aunt
matilda
will
give
me
a
dollar
a
week
and
it
s
time
i
began
to
work
for
my
living
am
i
worth
that
much
yes
you
are
said
macartney
if
you
go
on
as
you
ve
i
shall
go
on
as
i
ve
begun
said
meg
thank
you
ma
am
and
she
walked
back
to
the
house
after
dinner
she
waited
to
speak
to
aunt
matilda
again
i
went
to
the
dairy
she
said
i
know
you
did
aunt
matilda
answered
mrs
macartney
told
me
about
it
you
can
go
on
i
ll
give
you
the
dollar
a
she
looked
the
child
over
again
as
she
had
done
in
the
morning
but
with
a
shade
of
expression
which
might
have
meant
a
touch
of
added
interest
perhaps
her
mind
paused
just
long
enough
to
bring
back
to
her
the
time
when
she
had
been
a
worker
at
twelve
years
old
and
also
had
belonged
to
no
one
she
ll
make
her
living
she
said
as
she
watched
meg
out
of
the
room
she
s
more
like
me
than
she
is
like
her
father
robert
wasn
t
worthless
but
he
had
no
having
made
quite
sure
that
she
was
not
wanted
in
the
dairy
for
the
time
being
meg
made
her
way
to
the
barn
she
was
glad
to
find
it
empty
so
that
she
could
climb
the
ladder
without
waiting
when
she
reached
the
top
and
clambered
over
the
straw
the
scent
of
it
seemed
delightful
to
her
it
was
like
something
welcoming
her
home
she
threw
herself
down
full
length
in
the
straw
parlor
robin
had
not
been
at
dinner
he
had
gone
out
early
and
had
not
returned
as
she
lay
stretching
her
tired
limbs
and
staring
up
at
the
nest
in
the
dark
roof
above
her
she
hoped
he
would
come
and
he
did
in
about
ten
minutes
she
heard
the
signal
from
the
barn
floor
and
answered
it
robin
came
up
the
ladder
rather
slowly
when
he
made
his
way
over
the
straw
to
her
corner
and
threw
himself
down
beside
her
she
saw
that
he
was
tired
too
they
talked
a
few
minutes
about
ordinary
things
and
then
meg
thought
she
would
tell
him
about
the
dairy
but
it
appeared
that
he
had
something
to
tell
himself
and
he
began
first
i
ve
been
making
a
plan
meg
he
said
have
you
said
meg
what
is
it
i
ve
been
thinking
about
it
for
two
or
three
days
he
went
on
but
i
thought
i
wouldn
t
say
anything
about
it
i
tried
how
it
would
meg
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
looked
at
him
curiously
it
seemed
so
queer
that
he
should
have
had
a
plan
too
have
she
said
yes
he
answered
i
have
been
working
for
jones
this
morning
and
i
did
quite
a
lot
i
worked
hard
i
wanted
him
to
see
what
i
could
do
and
then
meg
i
asked
him
if
he
would
take
me
the
rest
of
the
pay
me
what
i
was
and
what
did
he
say
breathlessly
he
looked
at
me
a
half
laughed
and
i
thought
he
was
going
to
say
i
wasn
t
worth
anything
it
wouldn
t
have
been
true
but
i
thought
he
might
because
i
m
only
twelve
years
old
it
s
pretty
hard
to
be
only
twelve
when
you
want
to
get
work
but
he
didn
t
he
said
well
i
m
darned
if
i
won
t
give
you
a
show
and
i
m
to
have
a
dollar
a
robin
meg
cried
with
a
little
gasp
of
excitement
so
am
i
so
are
you
cried
robin
and
sat
bolt
upright
it
s
because
we
are
twins
said
meg
her
eyes
shining
like
lamps
i
told
you
twins
did
things
alike
because
they
couldn
t
help
it
we
have
both
thought
of
the
same
thing
i
went
to
aunt
matilda
asked
her
to
let
me
work
somewhere
and
pay
me
and
she
let
me
go
into
the
dairy
and
try
and
macartney
said
i
was
a
help
and
i
am
to
have
a
dollar
a
week
if
i
go
on
as
i
ve
robin
s
hand
gave
hers
a
clutch
just
as
it
had
done
before
that
day
when
he
had
not
known
why
meg
i
believe
he
said
i
believe
that
we
two
will
always
go
on
as
we
begin
i
believe
we
were
born
that
way
we
have
to
we
can
t
help
it
and
two
dollars
a
week
if
they
keep
us
and
we
save
it
could
go
almost
meg
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
a
searching
but
half
frightened
expression
almost
anywhere
she
said
quite
in
a
whisper
anywhere
not
more
than
a
hundred
miles
v
they
did
not
tell
each
other
of
the
strange
and
bold
thought
which
had
leaped
up
in
their
minds
that
day
each
felt
an
unwonted
shyness
about
it
perhaps
because
it
had
been
so
bold
but
it
had
been
in
each
mind
and
hidden
though
it
was
it
remained
furtively
in
both
they
went
on
exactly
as
they
had
begun
each
morning
meg
went
to
her
drudgery
in
the
dairy
and
robin
followed
jones
whithersoever
duty
led
if
the
elder
people
had
imagined
they
would
get
tired
and
give
up
they
found
out
their
mistake
that
they
were
often
tired
was
true
but
that
in
either
there
arose
once
the
thought
of
giving
up
never
and
they
worked
hard
the
things
they
did
to
earn
their
weekly
stipend
would
have
touched
the
heart
of
a
mother
of
children
but
on
jennings
s
model
farm
people
knew
how
much
work
a
human
being
could
do
when
necessity
drove
they
were
all
driven
by
necessity
and
it
was
nothing
new
to
know
that
muscles
ached
and
feet
swelled
and
burned
in
fact
they
knew
no
one
who
did
not
suffer
as
a
rule
from
these
small
inconveniences
and
these
children
with
their
set
little
faces
and
mature
intelligence
were
somehow
so
unsuggestive
of
the
weakness
and
limitations
of
childhood
that
they
were
often
given
work
which
was
usually
intrusted
only
to
elder
people
macartney
found
that
meg
never
slighted
anything
never
failed
in
a
task
and
never
forgot
one
so
she
gave
her
plenty
to
do
scrubbing
and
scouring
that
others
were
glad
to
shirk
fell
to
her
share
she
lifted
and
dragged
things
about
that
girls
grumbled
over
what
she
lacked
in
muscle
and
size
she
made
up
in
indomitable
will
power
that
made
her
small
face
set
itself
and
her
small
body
become
rigid
as
iron
her
work
ended
by
not
confining
itself
to
the
dairy
but
extended
to
the
house
the
there
were
tiresome
things
to
be
done
with
robin
it
was
the
same
story
jones
was
not
afraid
to
give
him
any
order
he
was
of
use
in
all
the
huge
fields
in
the
barn
in
the
stables
and
as
a
messenger
to
be
trusted
to
trudge
any
distance
when
transport
was
not
available
they
both
grew
thin
but
sinewy
looking
and
their
faces
had
a
rather
strained
look
their
always
large
black
eyes
seemed
to
grow
bigger
and
their
little
square
jaws
looked
more
square
every
day
but
on
saturday
nights
they
each
were
paid
their
dollar
and
climbed
to
the
straw
parlor
and
unburied
the
treasure
and
added
to
it
those
saturday
nights
were
wonderful
things
to
the
end
of
life
they
would
never
forget
them
through
all
the
tired
hours
of
labor
they
were
looked
forward
to
then
they
lay
in
their
nest
of
straw
and
talked
things
it
seemed
that
they
could
relax
and
rest
their
limbs
as
they
could
do
it
nowhere
else
jennings
was
not
given
to
sofas
and
and
it
is
not
safe
to
change
position
often
when
one
has
a
bedfellow
but
in
the
straw
they
could
roll
at
full
length
curl
up
or
stretch
out
just
as
they
pleased
and
there
they
could
enlarge
upon
the
one
subject
that
filled
their
minds
and
fascinated
and
enraptured
them
who
could
wonder
that
it
was
so
the
city
beautiful
was
growing
day
by
day
and
the
development
of
its
glories
was
the
one
thing
they
heard
talked
of
robin
had
established
the
habit
of
collecting
every
scrap
of
newspaper
referring
to
it
he
cut
them
out
of
aunt
matilda
s
old
papers
he
begged
them
from
every
one
neighbors
work
hands
when
he
was
sent
on
errands
he
cast
an
glance
round
every
place
his
orders
took
him
to
the
postmaster
of
the
nearest
village
discovered
his
weakness
and
saved
paragraphs
and
whole
papers
for
him
before
very
long
there
was
buried
near
the
treasure
a
treasure
even
more
valuable
of
newspaper
cuttings
and
on
the
wonderful
saturday
nights
they
gave
themselves
up
to
revelling
in
them
how
they
watched
it
and
followed
it
and
lived
with
great
human
scheme
which
somehow
seemed
to
their
young
minds
more
like
the
scheme
of
giants
and
genii
how
they
seized
upon
every
new
story
of
its
wonders
and
felt
that
there
could
be
no
limit
to
them
they
knew
every
purpose
and
plan
connected
with
arch
and
tower
and
hall
and
stone
they
pleased
themselves
by
fancying
newspapers
were
liberal
with
information
people
talked
of
it
they
heard
of
it
on
every
side
to
them
it
seemed
that
the
whole
world
must
be
thinking
of
nothing
else
while
we
are
lying
here
meg
while
you
are
doing
chores
and
i
am
scouring
pans
and
scrubbing
things
it
is
all
going
on
people
in
france
and
in
england
and
in
italy
are
doing
work
to
send
to
are
painting
pictures
and
machinery
is
whirling
and
making
things
and
everything
is
pouring
into
that
one
wonderful
place
and
men
and
women
planned
it
you
men
and
women
and
if
we
live
a
few
years
we
shall
be
men
and
women
and
they
were
once
children
like
if
they
had
been
quite
like
us
they
would
never
have
known
enough
to
do
but
when
they
were
children
like
us
said
robin
they
did
not
know
what
they
would
have
learned
by
this
they
never
dreamed
about
that
shows
how
wonderful
men
and
women
are
said
meg
i
believe
they
can
do
if
they
set
their
minds
to
and
she
said
it
stubbornly
perhaps
they
can
said
robin
slowly
perhaps
could
do
anything
we
set
our
minds
there
was
the
suggestive
tone
in
his
voice
which
meg
had
been
thrilled
by
more
than
once
before
she
had
been
thrilled
by
it
most
strongly
when
he
had
said
that
if
they
saved
their
two
dollars
a
week
they
might
be
able
to
go
almost
anywhere
unconsciously
she
responded
to
it
now
if
i
could
do
anything
i
set
my
mind
to
she
said
do
you
know
what
i
would
set
my
mind
to
first
what
i
would
set
my
mind
to
going
to
that
wonderful
place
i
would
set
it
to
seeing
everything
there
and
remembering
all
i
could
hold
and
learning
all
there
was
to
be
i
would
it
so
would
i
said
robin
it
was
a
more
suggestive
voice
than
before
that
he
said
the
words
in
and
suddenly
he
got
up
and
went
and
tore
away
the
straw
from
the
of
the
treasure
he
took
out
the
old
iron
bank
and
brought
it
back
to
their
corner
he
did
it
so
suddenly
and
with
such
a
determined
air
that
meg
rather
lost
her
breath
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
treasure
she
asked
i
am
going
to
count
why
he
was
opening
the
box
using
the
blade
of
a
stout
as
a
screwdriver
a
return
ticket
to
chicago
costs
fourteen
dollars
he
said
i
asked
at
the
dÃ©pÃ´t
that
would
be
dollars
for
two
people
any
one
who
is
careful
can
live
on
a
very
little
for
a
while
i
want
to
see
if
we
shall
have
money
enough
to
to
meg
cried
out
to
the
fair
robin
she
could
not
believe
the
evidence
of
her
sounded
so
daring
nobody
would
take
us
she
said
even
if
we
had
money
enough
to
pay
for
ourselves
nobody
would
take
take
answered
robin
working
at
his
screws
no
nobody
would
what
s
the
matter
with
taking
ourselves
meg
sat
up
in
the
straw
conscious
of
a
sort
of
shock
to
go
by
ourselves
like
people
to
buy
our
tickets
ourselves
and
get
on
the
train
and
go
all
the
and
walk
about
the
fair
alone
robin
who
takes
care
of
us
here
answered
robin
who
has
looked
after
us
ever
since
father
and
mother
died
ourselves
just
ourselves
whose
business
are
we
but
our
own
who
thinks
of
us
or
asks
if
we
are
happy
or
unhappy
nobody
said
meg
and
she
hid
her
face
in
her
arms
on
her
knees
robin
went
on
stubbornly
nobody
is
ever
going
to
do
it
he
said
if
we
live
to
be
hundreds
of
years
old
i
ve
thought
of
it
when
i
ve
been
working
in
the
fields
with
jones
and
i
ve
thought
of
it
when
i
ve
been
lying
awake
at
night
it
s
kept
me
awake
many
and
many
a
so
it
has
me
said
meg
and
since
this
thing
began
to
be
talked
about
everywhere
i
ve
thought
of
it
more
and
more
said
rob
it
means
more
to
people
like
us
than
it
does
to
any
one
else
it
s
the
people
who
never
see
things
who
have
no
chances
it
means
the
most
to
and
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
won
t
let
it
go
by
me
and
all
at
once
he
threw
himself
face
downward
on
the
straw
and
hid
his
face
in
his
arms
meg
lifted
hers
there
was
something
in
the
woful
desperation
of
his
movement
that
struck
her
to
the
heart
she
had
never
known
him
do
such
a
thing
in
their
lives
before
that
was
not
his
way
whatsoever
hard
thing
had
lonely
and
desolate
they
had
had
never
shown
his
feeling
in
this
way
she
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
his
shoulder
robin
she
said
oh
robin
i
don
t
care
he
said
from
the
refuge
of
his
sleeves
we
little
when
we
are
compared
with
people
they
would
call
us
children
and
children
usually
have
some
one
to
help
them
and
tell
them
what
to
do
i
m
only
like
this
because
i
ve
been
thinking
so
much
and
working
so
it
does
seem
like
an
enchanted
no
one
ever
thinks
we
could
care
about
anything
more
than
if
we
were
cats
and
dogs
it
was
not
like
that
at
home
even
if
we
were
then
he
sat
up
with
as
little
warning
as
he
had
thrown
himself
down
and
gave
his
eyes
a
fierce
rub
he
returned
to
the
treasure
again
i
ve
been
making
up
my
mind
to
it
for
days
he
said
if
we
have
the
money
we
can
buy
our
tickets
and
go
some
night
without
saying
anything
to
any
one
we
can
leave
a
note
for
aunt
matilda
and
tell
her
we
are
all
right
and
we
are
coming
back
she
ll
be
too
busy
to
do
you
remember
that
book
of
father
s
we
read
said
meg
that
one
called
david
david
ran
away
from
the
bottle
place
when
he
was
younger
than
we
are
and
he
had
to
walk
all
the
way
to
we
shall
not
have
to
walk
and
we
won
t
let
any
one
take
our
money
away
from
us
said
robin
are
we
going
really
said
meg
you
speak
as
if
we
were
truly
going
and
it
do
you
know
what
you
said
just
now
about
believing
human
beings
could
do
if
they
set
their
minds
to
it
let
s
set
our
minds
to
well
meg
answered
rather
slowly
as
if
weighing
the
matter
let
s
and
she
fell
to
helping
to
count
the
treasure
vi
afterwards
when
they
looked
back
upon
that
day
they
knew
that
the
thing
had
decided
itself
then
though
neither
of
them
had
said
so
the
truth
was
robin
used
to
say
we
had
both
been
thinking
the
same
thing
as
we
always
do
but
we
had
been
thinking
it
in
the
back
part
of
our
minds
we
were
afraid
to
let
it
come
to
the
front
at
first
because
it
seemed
such
a
big
thing
but
it
went
on
thinking
by
itself
that
time
when
you
said
we
shall
see
it
and
i
said
how
do
you
know
we
were
both
thinking
about
it
in
one
way
and
i
know
i
was
thinking
about
it
when
i
said
we
are
not
going
to
stay
here
always
that
is
the
first
step
up
the
hill
of
and
that
day
when
you
said
you
would
not
let
it
go
by
you
meg
would
answer
that
was
the
day
we
reached
the
wicket
it
seemed
very
like
it
for
from
that
day
their
strange
unchildish
purpose
grew
and
ripened
and
never
for
an
hour
was
absent
from
the
mind
of
either
if
they
had
been
like
other
children
living
happy
lives
full
of
young
interests
and
pleasures
it
might
have
been
crossed
out
by
other
and
newer
things
if
they
had
been
of
a
slighter
mental
build
and
less
strong
they
might
have
forgotten
it
but
they
never
did
when
they
had
counted
the
treasure
and
had
realized
how
small
it
was
after
all
they
had
sat
and
gazed
at
each
other
for
a
while
with
grave
eyes
but
they
had
only
been
grave
and
not
despairing
dollars
said
robin
well
that
s
not
much
after
nearly
six
years
but
we
saved
it
nearly
all
by
cents
you
know
and
it
takes
a
hundred
cents
to
make
a
dollar
said
meg
and
we
were
poor
people
s
and
we
bought
the
chickens
said
robin
and
you
have
always
given
me
a
present
at
christmas
robin
even
if
it
only
a
little
one
that
s
six
we
have
eight
months
to
work
in
said
robin
calculating
if
you
get
four
dollars
a
month
and
i
get
four
that
will
be
dollars
by
next
june
dollars
and
dollars
make
dollars
for
us
to
live
on
and
go
to
see
all
the
things
because
we
must
see
them
all
if
we
go
and
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
come
back
a
long
breath
oh
dear
cried
meg
how
we
come
back
i
don
t
know
said
robin
we
shall
hate
it
but
we
have
nowhere
else
to
perhaps
we
are
going
to
seek
our
fortunes
and
perhaps
we
shall
find
them
said
meg
or
perhaps
aunt
matilda
won
t
let
us
come
back
rob
with
some
awe
do
you
think
she
will
be
angry
i
ve
thought
about
that
robin
answered
contemplatively
and
i
don
t
think
she
will
she
would
be
too
busy
to
care
much
even
if
we
ran
away
and
said
nothing
but
i
shall
leave
a
letter
and
tell
her
we
have
saved
our
money
and
gone
somewhere
for
a
holiday
and
we
re
all
right
and
she
need
not
she
won
t
bother
even
if
she
is
angry
meg
said
with
mournful
eyes
she
doesn
t
care
about
us
if
she
loved
us
rob
said
and
was
too
poor
to
take
us
herself
we
couldn
t
go
at
all
we
couldn
t
run
away
because
it
would
worry
her
so
you
can
t
do
a
thing
however
much
you
want
to
do
it
if
it
is
going
to
hurt
somebody
who
is
good
to
you
and
well
then
we
needn
t
stay
here
because
of
aunt
matilda
said
meggy
that
s
one
sure
thing
it
wouldn
t
interfere
with
her
ploughing
if
we
were
both
to
die
at
no
said
rob
deliberately
that
s
just
what
it
would
and
he
threw
himself
back
on
the
straw
and
clasped
his
hands
under
his
head
gazing
up
into
the
dark
roof
above
him
with
very
reflective
eyes
but
they
had
reached
the
wicket
gate
and
from
the
hour
they
passed
it
there
was
no
looking
back
that
in
their
utter
friendlessness
and
loneliness
they
should
take
their
fates
in
their
own
strong
little
hands
was
perhaps
a
pathetic
thing
that
once
having
done
so
they
moved
towards
their
object
as
steadily
as
if
they
had
been
of
the
maturest
years
was
remarkable
but
no
one
ever
knew
or
even
suspected
the
first
until
the
last
the
days
went
by
full
of
work
which
left
them
little
time
to
lie
and
talk
in
the
straw
parlor
they
could
only
see
each
other
in
the
leisure
hours
which
were
so
few
and
only
came
when
the
day
was
waning
finding
them
faithful
and
ready
those
about
them
fell
into
the
natural
easy
human
unworthiness
of
imposing
by
no
means
infrequently
on
their
inexperienced
willingness
and
youth
so
they
were
hard
enough
worked
but
each
felt
that
every
day
that
passed
brought
them
nearer
to
the
end
in
view
and
there
was
always
something
to
think
of
some
detail
to
be
worked
out
mentally
or
to
be
discussed
in
the
valuable
moments
when
they
were
together
it
s
a
great
deal
better
than
it
used
to
be
meg
said
at
all
events
it
s
better
to
feel
tired
by
working
than
to
be
tired
of
doing
nothing
but
think
and
think
dreary
as
the
weather
grew
colder
it
was
hard
enough
to
keep
warm
in
their
they
used
to
sit
and
talk
huddled
close
together
bundled
in
their
heaviest
clothing
and
with
the
straw
heaped
close
around
them
and
over
them
there
were
so
many
things
to
be
thought
of
and
talked
over
robin
collected
facts
more
sedulously
than
about
entrance
fees
facts
about
prices
of
things
to
eat
facts
about
places
to
sleep
going
to
the
fair
yourself
sonny
jones
said
to
him
one
day
jones
was
fond
of
his
joke
you
re
right
to
be
inquirin
round
them
is
given
to
tot
up
bills
several
stories
higher
than
their
hotels
is
but
i
suppose
a
person
needn
t
go
to
a
hotel
said
robin
there
must
be
plenty
of
poor
people
who
can
t
go
to
hotels
and
they
ll
have
to
sleep
ah
there
s
plenty
of
poor
people
responded
jones
cheerfully
plenty
of
em
always
is
but
they
won
t
go
to
chicago
while
the
fair
s
on
they
ll
sleep
at
s
where
they
ll
that
s
the
worst
of
it
rob
said
to
meg
afterwards
you
see
we
have
to
sleep
we
could
live
on
bread
and
milk
or
crackers
and
we
have
to
it
will
be
warm
weather
meg
said
reflectively
perhaps
we
could
sleep
out
of
doors
beggars
do
we
don
t
i
don
t
think
the
police
would
let
us
robin
answered
if
they
we
might
have
to
some
night
but
we
are
going
to
that
place
are
yes
they
believed
they
were
going
and
lived
on
the
belief
this
being
decided
howsoever
difficult
to
attain
it
was
like
them
both
that
they
should
dwell
upon
the
dream
and
revel
in
it
in
a
way
peculiarly
their
own
it
was
meg
whose
imagination
was
the
stronger
and
it
is
true
that
it
was
always
she
who
made
pictures
in
words
and
told
stories
but
robin
was
always
as
ready
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
her
imaginings
as
she
was
to
talk
about
them
there
was
a
word
he
had
once
heard
his
father
use
which
had
caught
his
fancy
in
fact
it
had
attracted
them
both
and
they
applied
it
to
this
favorite
pleasure
of
theirs
of
romancing
with
everyday
things
the
word
was
now
we
have
finished
adding
up
and
making
plans
he
would
say
putting
his
into
his
pocket
let
us
philander
about
and
then
meg
would
begin
to
talk
about
the
city
city
beautiful
which
was
a
wonderful
and
curious
mixture
of
the
enchanted
one
the
whole
world
was
pouring
its
treasures
into
one
hundred
miles
away
and
that
city
beautiful
of
her
own
which
she
had
founded
upon
the
one
towards
which
christian
had
toiled
through
the
slough
of
despond
and
up
the
hill
of
difficulty
and
past
doubting
castle
somehow
one
could
scarcely
tell
where
one
ended
and
the
others
began
they
were
so
much
alike
these
three
s
meg
s
and
the
fair
ephemeral
one
the
ending
of
the
nineteenth
century
had
built
upon
the
blue
lake
s
side
they
must
look
alike
said
meg
i
am
sure
they
must
see
what
it
says
in
the
pilgrim
s
now
just
as
the
gates
were
opened
to
let
in
the
men
i
looked
in
after
them
and
behold
the
city
shone
like
the
sun
then
it
says
the
talk
they
had
with
the
shining
ones
was
about
the
glory
of
the
place
who
told
them
that
the
beauty
and
glory
of
it
were
i
always
think
of
it
robin
when
i
read
about
those
places
like
white
palaces
and
temples
and
towers
that
are
being
built
i
am
so
glad
they
are
white
think
how
the
city
will
shine
like
the
sun
when
it
stands
under
the
blue
sky
and
by
the
blue
water
on
a
sunshiny
they
had
never
read
the
dear
old
worn
pilgrim
s
progress
as
they
did
in
those
days
they
kept
it
in
the
straw
near
the
treasure
and
always
had
it
at
hand
to
refer
to
in
it
they
seemed
to
find
parallels
for
everything
aunt
matilda
s
world
is
the
city
of
destruction
they
would
say
and
our
loneliness
and
poorness
are
like
christian
s
we
have
to
carry
it
like
a
heavy
weight
and
it
holds
us
what
was
it
that
goodwill
said
to
christian
about
it
robin
asked
meg
turned
over
the
pages
she
knew
all
the
places
by
heart
it
was
easy
enough
to
find
and
read
how
at
last
there
came
a
grave
person
to
the
gate
named
goodwill
and
in
the
end
he
said
as
to
thy
burden
be
content
to
bear
it
until
thou
comest
to
the
place
of
deliverance
for
there
it
will
fall
from
thy
back
but
out
of
the
pilgrim
s
progress
robin
said
with
his
reflecting
air
burdens
don
t
fall
off
by
themselves
if
you
are
content
with
them
they
stick
on
and
get
bigger
ours
would
i
know
you
have
to
do
something
yourself
to
get
them
off
with
a
little
pause
for
thought
i
like
that
part
meg
and
i
like
goodwill
because
he
told
it
to
him
it
encouraged
him
you
know
you
see
it
says
next
then
christian
began
to
gird
up
his
loins
and
address
himself
to
his
robin
said
meg
suddenly
shutting
the
book
and
giving
it
a
little
thump
on
the
back
it
s
not
only
christian
s
city
that
is
like
our
city
are
like
christian
we
are
pilgrims
and
our
way
to
that
place
is
our
pilgrims
vii
and
the
cold
days
of
hard
work
kept
going
by
and
the
city
beautiful
grew
and
huddled
close
together
in
the
straw
the
children
planned
and
dreamed
and
read
and
the
pilgrim
s
progress
following
christian
step
by
step
and
aunt
matilda
became
busier
every
day
it
seemed
and
did
not
remember
that
they
were
alive
except
when
she
saw
them
and
nobody
guessed
and
nobody
knew
days
so
quickly
grow
to
weeks
and
weeks
slip
by
so
easily
until
they
are
months
and
at
last
there
came
a
time
when
meg
going
out
in
the
morning
felt
a
softer
air
and
stopped
a
moment
by
a
bare
tree
to
breathe
it
in
and
feel
its
lovely
touch
upon
her
cheek
she
turned
her
face
upward
with
a
movement
and
found
herself
looking
at
such
a
limitless
vault
of
tender
blueness
that
her
heart
gave
a
quick
throb
seemed
to
spring
up
to
it
and
carry
her
with
it
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
left
the
earth
far
below
and
was
soaring
in
the
soft
depths
of
blueness
themselves
and
suddenly
even
as
she
felt
it
she
heard
on
the
topmost
branch
of
the
bare
tree
a
brief
little
rapturous
trill
and
her
heart
gave
a
leap
again
and
she
felt
her
cheeks
grow
warm
it
is
a
bluebird
she
said
it
is
a
bluebird
and
it
is
the
spring
and
that
means
that
the
time
is
quite
she
had
a
queer
little
smile
on
her
face
all
day
as
she
worked
she
did
not
know
it
was
there
herself
but
macartney
saw
it
what
s
pleasing
you
so
meggy
my
girl
she
asked
meg
wakened
up
with
a
sort
of
start
i
don
t
she
said
you
don
t
know
said
the
woman
you
look
as
if
you
were
thinking
over
a
secret
and
it
was
a
pleasant
that
evening
it
was
not
cold
when
they
sat
in
the
straw
parlor
and
meg
told
robin
about
the
bluebird
it
gave
me
a
strange
feeling
to
hear
it
she
said
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
speaking
to
me
it
said
you
must
get
ready
it
is
quite
they
had
made
up
their
minds
that
they
would
go
in
june
before
the
weather
became
so
hot
that
they
might
suffer
from
it
because
we
have
to
consider
everything
was
robin
s
idea
we
shall
be
walking
about
all
the
time
and
we
have
no
cool
clothes
and
we
shall
have
no
money
to
buy
cool
things
and
if
we
should
be
ill
it
would
be
worse
for
us
than
for
children
who
have
some
one
with
in
the
little
they
had
calculated
all
they
should
own
on
the
day
their
pilgrimage
began
they
had
apportioned
it
all
out
so
much
for
the
price
of
the
railroad
tickets
so
much
for
entrance
fees
so
much
but
so
so
little
their
food
and
lodging
i
have
listened
when
jones
and
the
others
were
talking
said
robin
and
they
say
that
everybody
who
has
room
to
spare
and
wants
to
make
money
is
going
to
let
every
corner
they
have
so
you
see
there
will
be
sure
to
be
people
who
have
quite
poor
places
that
they
would
be
obliged
to
rent
cheap
to
people
who
are
poor
like
themselves
we
will
go
through
the
small
side
streets
and
the
first
bluebird
came
again
day
after
day
and
others
came
with
it
until
the
swift
dart
of
blue
wings
through
the
air
and
the
delicious
ripple
of
joyous
sound
were
no
longer
rare
things
the
days
grew
warmer
and
the
men
threw
off
their
coats
and
began
to
draw
their
across
their
foreheads
when
they
were
at
work
one
evening
when
robin
came
up
into
the
straw
parlor
he
brought
something
with
him
it
was
a
battered
old
tin
what
is
that
for
asked
meg
for
he
seemed
to
carry
it
as
if
it
was
of
some
value
it
s
old
and
rusty
but
there
are
no
holes
in
it
robin
answered
i
saw
it
lying
in
a
fence
corner
where
some
one
had
thrown
a
tramp
and
it
put
a
new
thought
into
my
head
it
will
do
to
boil
eggs
eggs
said
meg
there
s
nothing
much
nicer
than
eggs
said
robin
and
you
can
carry
them
about
with
you
it
just
came
into
my
mind
that
we
could
take
some
of
our
eggs
and
go
somewhere
where
no
one
would
be
likely
to
see
us
and
build
a
fire
of
sticks
and
boil
some
eggs
and
carry
them
with
us
to
robin
cried
meg
with
admiring
ecstasy
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
that
it
doesn
t
matter
which
of
us
thought
of
it
said
rob
it
s
all
the
so
it
was
decided
that
when
the
time
came
they
should
boil
their
supply
of
eggs
very
hard
and
roll
them
up
in
pieces
of
paper
and
tuck
them
away
carefully
in
the
one
small
bag
which
was
to
carry
all
their
necessary
belongings
these
belongings
would
be
very
enough
to
keep
them
decent
and
clean
and
a
brush
and
comb
between
them
they
used
to
lie
in
bed
at
night
with
beating
hearts
thinking
it
all
over
sometimes
awakening
in
a
cold
perspiration
from
a
dreadful
dream
in
which
aunt
matilda
or
jones
or
some
of
the
hands
had
discovered
their
secret
and
confronted
them
with
it
in
all
its
daring
they
were
so
full
of
it
night
and
day
that
meg
used
to
wonder
that
the
people
about
them
did
not
see
it
in
their
faces
they
are
not
thinking
of
us
said
robin
they
are
thinking
about
crops
i
dare
say
aunt
matilda
would
like
to
see
the
agricultural
building
but
she
couldn
t
waste
the
time
to
go
through
the
oh
what
a
day
it
was
what
a
thrilling
exciting
almost
unbearably
joyful
day
when
robin
gathered
sticks
and
dried
bits
of
branches
and
piled
them
in
a
corner
of
a
field
far
enough
from
the
house
and
outbuildings
to
be
quite
safe
he
did
it
one
noon
hour
and
as
he
passed
meg
on
his
way
back
to
his
work
he
whispered
i
have
got
the
sticks
for
the
fire
all
and
after
supper
they
crept
out
to
the
place
with
matches
and
the
battered
old
and
the
eggs
as
they
made
their
preparations
they
found
themselves
talking
in
whispers
though
there
was
not
the
least
chance
of
any
one
s
hearing
them
meg
looked
rather
like
a
little
witch
as
she
stood
over
the
bubbling
old
pot
with
her
strange
little
dark
face
and
shining
eyes
and
black
elf
locks
it
s
like
making
a
kind
of
sacrifice
on
an
altar
she
said
you
always
think
queer
things
about
everything
don
t
you
said
robin
but
they
re
all
right
i
don
t
think
of
them
myself
but
i
like
when
the
eggs
were
boiled
hard
enough
they
carried
them
to
the
barn
and
hid
them
in
the
straw
parlor
near
the
treasure
then
they
sat
and
talked
in
whispers
still
almost
trembling
with
joy
somehow
do
you
know
meg
said
it
feels
as
if
we
were
going
to
do
something
more
than
just
go
to
the
fair
when
people
in
stories
go
to
seek
their
fortunes
i
m
sure
they
feel
like
this
does
it
give
you
a
kind
of
creeping
in
your
stomach
whenever
you
think
of
it
rob
yes
it
does
robin
whispered
back
and
when
it
comes
into
my
mind
suddenly
something
gives
a
queer
jump
inside
that
s
your
heart
said
meg
robin
if
anything
should
stop
us
i
believe
i
should
drop
no
you
wouldn
t
was
rob
s
answer
but
it
s
better
not
to
let
ourselves
think
about
it
and
i
don
t
believe
anything
as
bad
as
that
happen
we
ve
worked
so
hard
and
we
have
nobody
but
ourselves
and
it
can
t
do
any
one
any
we
don
t
to
do
any
one
any
harm
no
there
must
be
that
wouldn
t
let
it
illustration
meg
looked
rather
like
a
little
witch
i
believe
that
too
said
meg
and
this
time
it
was
she
who
clutched
at
robin
s
hand
but
he
seemed
glad
she
did
and
held
as
close
as
she
and
then
after
the
bluebirds
had
sung
a
few
times
more
there
came
a
night
when
meg
crept
out
of
her
cot
after
she
was
sure
that
the
woman
in
the
other
bed
was
sleeping
heavily
enough
every
one
went
to
bed
early
and
every
one
slept
through
the
night
in
heavy
tired
sleep
too
much
work
was
done
on
the
place
to
allow
people
to
waste
time
in
sleeplessness
meg
knew
no
one
would
waken
as
she
crept
down
stairs
to
the
lower
part
of
the
house
and
softly
opened
the
back
door
robin
was
standing
outside
with
the
little
leather
satchel
in
his
hand
it
was
a
soft
warm
night
and
the
dark
blue
sky
was
full
of
the
glitter
of
stars
both
he
and
meg
stood
still
a
moment
and
looked
up
i
m
glad
it
s
like
this
meg
said
it
doesn
t
seem
so
lonely
is
your
heart
thumping
robin
yes
rather
whispered
robin
i
left
the
letter
in
a
place
where
aunt
matilda
will
be
likely
to
find
it
some
time
what
did
you
say
meg
whispered
back
what
i
told
you
i
was
going
to
there
wasn
t
much
to
say
just
told
her
we
had
saved
our
money
and
gone
away
for
a
few
days
and
we
were
all
right
and
she
needn
t
everything
was
very
still
about
them
there
was
no
moon
and
but
for
the
stars
it
would
have
been
very
dark
as
it
was
the
stillness
of
night
and
sleep
and
the
sombreness
of
the
hour
might
have
made
less
strong
little
creatures
feel
timid
and
alone
let
us
take
hold
of
each
other
s
hands
as
we
walk
along
said
meg
it
will
make
us
feel
nearer
and
so
hand
in
hand
they
went
out
on
the
road
together
viii
it
was
four
miles
to
the
dÃ©pÃ´t
but
they
were
good
walkers
robin
hung
the
satchel
on
a
stick
over
his
shoulder
they
kept
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
walked
smartly
there
were
not
many
trees
but
there
were
a
few
occasionally
and
it
was
pleasanter
to
walk
where
the
way
before
them
was
quite
clear
and
somehow
they
found
themselves
still
talking
in
whispers
though
there
was
certainly
no
one
to
overhear
them
let
us
talk
about
christian
said
meg
it
will
not
seem
so
lonely
if
we
are
talking
i
wish
we
could
meet
if
we
knew
he
was
evangelist
when
we
met
him
said
robin
if
we
didn
t
know
him
we
should
think
he
was
some
one
who
would
stop
us
and
after
all
you
see
he
only
showed
christian
the
shining
light
and
told
him
to
go
to
it
and
we
are
farther
on
than
that
we
have
passed
the
wicket
the
thing
we
want
said
meg
is
the
roll
to
read
as
we
go
on
and
find
out
what
we
are
to
and
then
they
talked
of
what
was
before
them
they
wondered
who
would
be
at
the
little
dÃ©pÃ´t
and
if
they
would
be
noticed
and
of
what
the
would
think
when
robin
bought
the
tickets
perhaps
he
won
t
notice
me
at
all
said
rob
and
he
does
not
know
me
somebody
might
be
sending
us
alone
you
know
we
are
not
that
s
true
responded
meg
courageously
if
we
were
six
years
old
it
would
be
different
but
we
are
twelve
it
did
make
it
seem
less
lonely
to
be
talking
and
so
they
did
not
stop
and
there
was
so
much
to
say
robin
broke
forth
meg
once
giving
his
hand
a
sudden
clutch
we
are
on
the
are
soon
we
shall
be
in
the
train
and
it
will
be
carrying
us
nearer
and
nearer
suppose
it
was
a
dream
and
we
should
wake
up
it
isn
t
a
dream
said
rob
stoutly
it
s
s
as
real
as
aunt
matilda
he
was
always
more
than
meg
we
needn
t
philander
any
more
meg
said
it
isn
t
philandering
to
talk
about
a
real
oh
rob
just
think
of
for
us
under
the
stars
this
very
city
beautiful
and
then
walking
close
to
each
other
in
the
dimness
they
told
each
other
how
they
saw
it
in
imagination
and
what
its
wonders
would
be
to
them
and
which
they
would
see
first
and
how
they
would
remember
it
all
their
lives
afterwards
and
have
things
to
talk
of
and
think
of
very
few
people
would
see
it
as
they
would
but
they
did
not
know
that
it
was
not
a
gigantic
enterprise
to
them
a
great
scheme
fought
for
and
struggled
over
for
the
divers
reasons
poor
humanity
makes
for
itself
that
it
would
either
make
or
lose
money
was
not
a
side
of
the
question
that
reached
them
they
only
dwelt
on
the
beauty
and
wonder
of
it
which
made
it
seem
like
an
enchanted
thing
i
keep
thinking
of
the
white
palaces
and
that
it
is
like
a
fairy
story
meg
said
and
that
it
will
melt
away
like
those
cities
travellers
sometimes
see
in
the
desert
and
i
wish
it
wouldn
t
but
it
will
have
been
real
for
a
while
and
everybody
will
remember
it
i
am
so
glad
it
is
white
i
am
glad
it
is
white
robin
and
i
keep
thinking
said
robin
of
all
the
people
who
have
made
the
things
to
go
in
it
and
how
they
have
worked
and
invented
there
have
been
some
people
perhaps
who
have
worked
months
and
months
making
one
single
as
we
have
worked
to
go
to
see
it
and
perhaps
at
first
they
were
afraid
they
couldn
t
do
it
and
they
set
their
minds
to
it
as
we
did
and
tried
and
tried
and
then
did
it
at
last
i
like
to
think
of
those
men
and
women
meg
because
when
the
city
has
melted
away
the
things
won
t
melt
they
will
last
after
the
people
and
we
are
too
i
m
a
man
and
you
are
a
woman
you
know
though
we
are
only
twelve
and
it
gives
me
a
strong
feeling
to
think
of
those
it
makes
you
think
that
perhaps
men
and
women
do
anything
if
they
set
their
minds
to
it
said
meg
quite
solemnly
oh
i
do
like
that
i
like
it
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
said
rob
stop
a
minute
meg
come
here
in
the
he
said
the
last
words
quickly
and
pulled
her
to
the
roadside
where
a
big
tree
grew
which
threw
a
deep
shadow
he
stood
listening
it
s
wheels
he
whispered
there
is
a
buggy
coming
we
mustn
t
let
any
one
see
it
was
a
buggy
they
could
tell
that
by
the
lightness
of
the
wheels
and
it
was
coming
rapidly
they
could
hear
s
they
drew
back
and
stood
very
close
to
each
other
do
you
think
they
have
found
out
and
sent
some
one
after
us
whispered
meg
breathlessly
no
answered
robin
though
his
heart
beat
like
a
triphammer
no
no
the
wheels
drew
nearer
and
they
heard
one
of
the
men
speaking
chicago
by
sunrise
he
was
saying
and
what
i
don
t
see
of
it
won
t
be
worth
the
next
minute
the
horse
spun
swiftly
down
the
road
and
carried
the
voices
out
of
hearing
meg
and
robin
drew
twin
sighs
of
relief
robin
spoke
first
it
is
some
one
who
is
going
to
the
fair
he
said
perhaps
we
shall
see
him
in
the
train
said
meg
i
dare
say
we
shall
said
robin
it
was
nobody
who
knows
us
i
didn
t
know
his
voice
meg
let
s
take
hands
again
and
walk
quickly
we
might
lose
the
they
did
not
talk
much
more
but
walked
briskly
they
had
done
a
good
day
s
work
before
they
set
out
and
were
rather
tired
but
they
did
not
lag
on
that
account
sometimes
meg
took
a
turn
at
carrying
the
satchel
so
that
robin
might
rest
his
arm
it
was
not
heavy
and
she
was
as
strong
for
a
girl
as
he
was
for
a
boy
at
last
they
reached
the
dÃ©pÃ´t
there
were
a
number
of
people
waiting
on
the
platform
to
catch
the
train
to
chicago
and
there
were
several
vehicles
outside
they
passed
one
which
was
a
buggy
and
meg
gave
robin
a
nudge
with
her
elbow
perhaps
that
belongs
to
our
man
she
said
there
were
people
enough
before
the
office
to
give
the
plenty
to
do
robin
s
heart
quickened
a
little
as
he
passed
by
with
the
group
of
maturer
people
but
no
one
seemed
to
observe
him
particularly
and
he
returned
to
meg
with
the
precious
bits
of
pasteboard
held
very
tight
in
his
hand
meg
had
waited
alone
in
an
unlighted
corner
and
when
she
saw
him
coming
she
came
forward
to
meet
him
have
you
got
them
she
said
did
any
one
look
at
you
or
say
anything
yes
i
got
them
robin
answered
and
i
ll
tell
you
what
meg
these
people
are
nearly
all
going
just
where
we
are
going
and
they
are
so
busy
thinking
about
it
and
attending
to
themselves
that
they
haven
t
any
time
to
watch
any
one
else
that
s
one
good
and
the
nearer
we
get
to
chicago
meg
said
the
more
people
there
will
be
and
the
more
they
will
have
to
think
of
and
at
that
beautiful
place
where
there
is
so
much
to
see
who
will
look
at
two
children
i
don
t
believe
we
shall
have
any
trouble
at
it
really
did
not
seem
likely
that
they
would
but
it
happened
by
a
curious
coincidence
that
within
a
very
few
minutes
they
saw
somebody
looking
at
them
the
train
was
not
due
for
ten
minutes
and
there
were
a
few
people
who
being
too
restless
to
sit
in
the
walked
up
and
down
on
the
platform
most
of
these
were
men
and
there
were
two
men
who
walked
farther
than
the
others
did
and
so
neared
the
place
where
robin
and
meg
stood
in
the
shadow
one
was
a
young
man
and
seemed
to
be
listening
to
instructions
his
companion
who
was
older
was
giving
him
in
a
rapid
abrupt
sort
of
voice
this
companion
who
might
have
been
his
employer
was
a
man
of
middle
age
he
was
robust
of
figure
and
had
a
face
with
a
certain
effect
of
strong
good
looks
it
was
perhaps
rather
a
hard
face
but
it
was
a
face
one
would
look
at
more
than
once
and
he
too
oddly
enough
had
a
square
jaw
and
straight
black
brows
but
it
was
his
voice
which
first
attracted
robin
and
meg
as
he
neared
them
talking
it
s
the
man
in
the
buggy
whispered
robin
don
t
you
know
his
voice
again
and
they
watched
him
with
deep
interest
he
passed
them
once
without
seeming
to
see
them
at
all
he
was
explaining
something
to
his
companion
the
second
time
he
drew
near
he
chanced
to
look
up
and
his
eye
fell
on
them
it
did
not
rest
on
them
more
than
a
second
and
he
went
on
speaking
the
next
time
he
neared
their
part
of
the
platform
he
turned
his
glance
towards
them
as
they
stood
close
together
it
was
as
if
involuntarily
he
glanced
to
see
if
they
were
still
where
they
had
been
before
a
pair
of
children
they
heard
him
say
as
if
the
fleeting
impression
of
their
presence
arrested
his
train
of
thought
for
a
second
look
as
if
no
one
was
with
he
merely
made
the
comment
in
passing
and
returned
to
his
subject
the
next
second
but
meg
and
robin
heard
him
and
drew
farther
back
into
the
shadow
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
stand
there
much
longer
they
heard
a
familiar
sound
in
the
distance
the
shrill
cry
of
the
incoming
beloved
giant
who
was
to
carry
them
to
fairyland
the
people
began
to
flock
out
of
the
with
packages
and
valises
and
umbrellas
in
hand
the
porters
suddenly
became
alert
and
hurried
about
attending
to
their
duties
the
delightful
roar
drew
nearer
and
louder
and
began
to
shake
the
earth
it
grew
louder
still
a
bell
began
to
make
a
cheerful
tolling
people
were
rushing
to
and
fro
meg
and
robin
rushed
with
them
and
the
train
was
panting
in
the
dÃ©pÃ´t
it
was
even
more
thrilling
than
the
children
had
thought
it
would
be
they
had
travelled
so
very
little
and
did
not
know
exactly
where
to
go
it
might
not
be
the
right
train
even
they
did
not
know
how
long
it
would
wait
it
might
rush
away
again
before
they
could
get
on
people
seemed
in
such
a
hurry
and
so
excited
as
they
hurried
along
they
found
themselves
being
pushed
and
jostled
before
the
steps
of
one
of
the
cars
a
conductor
stood
whom
people
kept
showing
tickets
to
there
were
several
persons
round
him
when
robin
and
meg
reached
the
place
where
he
stood
people
kept
asking
him
things
and
sometimes
he
passed
them
on
and
sometimes
let
them
go
into
his
car
illustration
is
this
the
train
to
chicago
said
robin
is
this
the
train
to
chicago
said
robin
breathlessly
but
he
was
so
much
less
than
the
other
people
and
the
man
was
so
busy
he
did
not
hear
him
robin
tried
to
get
nearer
is
this
the
chicago
train
sir
he
said
a
little
louder
he
had
had
to
press
by
a
man
whom
he
had
been
too
excited
to
see
and
the
man
looked
down
and
spoke
to
him
chicago
train
he
said
in
a
voice
which
was
abrupt
without
being
yes
you
re
all
right
got
your
sleeping
tickets
robin
looked
up
at
him
quickly
he
knew
the
voice
and
was
vaguely
glad
to
hear
it
he
and
meg
had
never
been
in
a
in
their
lives
and
he
did
not
quite
understand
he
held
out
his
tickets
we
are
going
to
sleep
on
the
train
he
said
but
we
have
nothing
but
next
car
but
two
then
he
said
and
you
d
better
and
when
both
voices
thanked
him
at
once
and
the
two
caught
each
other
s
hands
and
ran
towards
their
car
he
looked
after
them
and
laughed
i
m
blessed
if
they
re
not
by
themselves
he
said
watching
them
as
they
scrambled
up
the
steps
and
they
re
going
to
the
fair
i
ll
bet
a
dollar
s
young
and
no
mistake
ix
the
car
was
quite
crowded
there
were
more
people
than
themselves
who
were
going
to
the
fair
and
were
obliged
to
economize
when
the
children
entered
and
looked
about
them
in
the
dim
light
they
thought
at
first
that
all
the
seats
were
full
people
seemed
to
be
huddled
up
asleep
or
sitting
up
awake
in
all
of
them
everybody
had
been
trying
to
get
to
sleep
at
least
and
the
twins
found
themselves
making
their
whispers
even
lower
than
before
i
think
there
is
a
seat
empty
just
behind
that
very
fat
lady
meg
whispered
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
car
and
they
went
to
it
and
found
she
was
right
they
took
possession
of
it
quietly
putting
their
satchel
under
the
seat
it
seems
so
still
said
meg
i
feel
as
if
i
was
in
somebody
s
bedroom
the
sound
of
the
wheels
makes
it
seem
all
the
quieter
it
s
as
if
we
were
shut
in
by
the
we
mustn
t
talk
said
robin
or
we
shall
waken
the
people
can
you
go
to
sleep
meg
i
can
if
i
can
stop
thinking
she
answered
with
a
joyful
sigh
i
m
very
tired
but
the
wheels
keep
saying
over
and
over
again
we
re
re
re
it
s
just
as
if
they
were
talking
don
t
you
hear
them
yes
i
do
do
they
say
that
to
you
too
but
we
mustn
t
listen
robin
whispered
back
if
we
do
we
shall
not
go
to
sleep
and
then
we
shall
be
too
tired
to
walk
about
let
s
put
our
heads
down
and
shut
our
eyes
well
let
s
said
meg
she
curled
herself
up
on
the
seat
and
put
her
head
into
the
corner
if
you
lean
against
me
rob
she
said
it
will
be
softer
we
can
take
they
changed
position
a
little
two
or
three
times
but
they
were
worn
out
with
the
day
s
work
and
their
walk
and
the
excitement
and
the
motion
of
the
train
seemed
like
a
sort
of
rocking
which
lulled
them
gradually
their
muscles
relaxed
and
they
settled
down
though
after
they
had
done
so
meg
spoke
once
drowsily
rob
she
said
did
you
see
that
was
our
man
yes
answered
rob
very
sleepily
indeed
and
he
looked
as
if
he
knew
if
they
had
been
less
young
or
if
they
had
been
less
tired
they
might
have
found
themselves
awake
a
good
many
times
during
the
night
but
they
were
such
children
and
now
that
the
great
step
was
taken
were
so
happy
that
the
soft
deep
sleepiness
of
youth
descended
upon
and
overpowered
them
once
or
twice
during
the
night
they
stirred
wakened
for
a
dreamy
blissful
moment
by
some
sound
of
a
door
shutting
or
a
conductor
passing
through
but
they
were
only
conscious
of
a
delicious
sense
of
strangeness
of
the
stillness
of
the
car
full
of
sleepers
of
the
delight
of
feeling
themselves
carried
along
through
the
unknown
country
and
of
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
which
never
ceased
saying
rhythmically
we
re
re
re
going
ah
what
a
night
of
dreams
and
new
vague
sensations
to
be
remembered
always
ah
that
heavenly
sense
of
joy
to
come
and
adventure
and
young
hopefulness
and
imagining
were
there
many
others
carried
towards
the
city
beautiful
that
night
who
bore
with
them
the
same
rapture
of
longing
and
belief
who
saw
with
such
innocent
clearness
only
the
fair
and
splendid
thought
which
had
created
it
and
were
so
innocently
blind
to
any
shadow
of
sordidness
or
mere
worldly
interest
touching
its
white
walls
and
after
the
passing
of
this
wonderful
night
what
a
wakening
in
the
morning
at
the
first
rosiness
of
dawn
when
all
the
other
occupants
of
the
car
were
still
asleep
or
restlessly
trying
to
be
at
ease
it
was
as
if
they
both
wakened
at
almost
the
same
moment
the
first
shaft
of
early
sunlight
streaming
in
the
window
touched
meg
s
eyelids
and
she
slowly
opened
them
then
something
joyous
and
exultant
rushed
in
upon
her
heart
and
she
sat
upright
and
robin
sat
up
too
and
they
looked
at
each
other
it
s
the
day
meg
said
robin
it
s
the
day
meg
caught
her
breath
and
nothing
has
stopped
us
she
said
and
we
are
getting
nearer
and
nearer
rob
let
us
look
out
of
the
for
a
while
they
looked
out
pressed
close
together
and
full
of
such
ecstasy
of
delight
in
the
strangeness
of
everything
that
at
first
they
did
not
exchange
even
their
whispers
it
is
rather
a
good
thing
to
well
worth
while
even
for
a
man
or
day
waking
and
waking
the
world
as
one
is
borne
swiftly
through
the
morning
light
and
one
looks
out
of
a
car
window
what
it
was
to
these
two
children
only
those
who
remember
the
children
who
were
themselves
long
ago
can
realize
at
all
the
country
went
hurrying
past
them
making
curious
sudden
revelations
and
giving
in
its
haste
prairie
and
field
farmhouse
and
wood
and
village
all
wore
a
strange
exciting
vanishing
aspect
it
seems
meg
said
as
if
it
was
all
going
a
great
if
it
couldn
t
wait
to
let
us
see
but
we
are
the
ones
that
are
going
said
rob
listen
to
the
we
shall
soon
be
after
a
while
the
people
who
were
asleep
began
to
stir
and
stretch
themselves
some
of
them
looked
cross
and
some
looked
tired
the
very
fat
lady
in
the
seat
before
them
had
a
coal
smut
on
her
nose
robin
said
meg
after
looking
at
her
seriously
a
moment
let
s
get
our
towel
out
of
the
bag
and
wet
it
and
wash
our
they
had
taken
the
liberty
of
borrowing
a
towel
from
aunt
matilda
it
was
meg
who
had
thought
of
it
and
it
had
indeed
been
an
inspiration
robin
wetted
two
corners
of
it
and
they
made
a
rigorous
if
limited
toilet
at
least
they
had
no
smuts
on
their
noses
and
after
a
little
touching
up
with
the
mutual
comb
and
brush
they
looked
none
the
worse
for
wear
their
plain
and
substantial
garments
were
not
of
the
order
which
has
any
special
charm
to
lose
and
it
s
not
our
clothes
that
are
going
to
the
fair
said
meg
it
s
and
by
the
time
they
were
in
good
order
the
farms
and
villages
they
were
flying
past
had
grown
nearer
together
the
platforms
at
the
dÃ©pÃ´ts
were
full
of
people
who
wore
a
less
provincial
look
the
houses
grew
larger
and
so
did
the
towns
they
found
themselves
flashing
past
advertisements
of
all
sorts
of
things
and
especially
of
things
connected
with
the
fair
you
know
how
we
used
to
play
hunt
the
thimble
said
robin
and
how
when
any
one
came
near
the
place
where
it
was
hidden
we
said
it
s
like
that
now
we
have
been
getting
warmer
and
warmer
every
minute
and
now
we
are
we
shall
be
in
in
a
minute
said
a
big
man
at
the
end
of
the
car
and
he
stood
up
and
began
to
take
down
his
things
hot
said
robin
with
an
excited
little
laugh
meg
we
re
not
any
more
look
out
of
the
we
are
steaming
into
the
big
dÃ©pÃ´t
cried
meg
how
big
it
is
what
crowds
of
people
robin
we
are
there
robin
bent
down
to
pick
up
their
satchel
the
people
all
rose
in
their
seats
and
began
to
move
in
a
mass
down
the
aisle
toward
the
door
everybody
seemed
suddenly
to
become
eager
and
in
a
hurry
as
if
they
thought
the
train
would
begin
to
move
again
and
carry
them
away
some
were
expecting
friends
to
meet
them
some
were
anxious
about
finding
accommodations
those
who
knew
each
other
talked
asked
questions
over
people
s
shoulders
and
there
was
a
general
anxiety
about
valises
parcels
and
umbrellas
robin
and
meg
were
pressed
back
into
their
section
by
the
crowd
against
which
they
were
too
young
to
make
headway
we
shall
have
to
wait
until
the
people
have
passed
by
rob
said
but
the
crowd
in
the
aisle
soon
lost
its
compactness
and
they
were
able
to
get
out
the
porter
who
stood
on
the
platform
near
the
steps
looked
at
them
curiously
and
glanced
behind
them
to
see
who
was
with
them
but
he
said
nothing
it
seemed
to
the
two
as
if
all
the
world
must
have
poured
itself
into
the
big
dÃ©pÃ´t
or
be
passing
through
it
people
were
rushing
about
friends
were
searching
for
one
another
pushing
their
way
through
the
surging
crowd
some
were
greeting
each
other
with
exclamations
and
and
stopping
up
the
way
there
was
a
babel
of
voices
a
clamor
of
shouts
within
the
covered
place
and
from
outside
came
a
roar
of
sound
rising
from
the
city
for
a
few
moments
robin
and
meg
were
overwhelmed
they
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
everybody
pushed
past
and
jostled
them
no
one
was
but
no
one
had
time
to
be
polite
they
were
so
young
and
so
strange
to
all
such
worlds
of
excitement
and
rush
involuntarily
they
clutched
each
other
s
hands
after
their
fashion
when
they
were
near
each
other
and
overpowered
the
human
vortex
caught
them
up
and
carried
them
along
not
knowing
where
they
were
going
we
seem
so
little
gasped
meg
are
so
many
people
rob
rob
where
are
we
going
robin
had
lost
his
breath
too
suddenly
the
world
seemed
so
huge
just
for
a
moment
he
felt
himself
turn
pale
and
he
looked
at
meg
and
saw
that
she
was
pale
too
everybody
is
going
out
of
the
dÃ©pÃ´t
he
said
hold
on
to
me
tight
meg
it
will
be
all
right
we
shall
get
and
so
they
did
the
crowd
surged
and
swayed
and
struggled
and
before
long
they
saw
that
it
was
surging
towards
the
entrance
gate
and
it
took
them
with
it
just
as
they
thrust
through
they
found
themselves
pushed
against
a
man
who
drew
a
little
back
to
save
meg
from
striking
against
his
valise
which
was
a
very
substantial
one
she
looked
up
to
thank
him
and
gave
a
little
start
it
was
the
man
she
had
called
our
man
the
night
before
when
she
spoke
of
him
to
robin
and
he
gave
them
a
sharp
but
friendly
nod
hallo
he
exclaimed
it
s
you
two
again
you
going
to
the
fair
robin
looked
up
at
his
shrewd
face
with
a
civil
little
grin
yes
sir
we
are
he
answered
hope
you
ll
enjoy
it
said
the
man
big
and
he
was
pushed
past
them
and
soon
lost
in
the
crowd
x
the
crowd
in
the
dÃ©pÃ´t
surged
into
the
streets
and
melted
into
and
became
an
addition
to
the
world
of
people
there
the
pavements
were
moving
masses
of
human
beings
the
centres
of
the
streets
were
pandemoniums
of
wagons
and
vans
street
cars
hotel
omnibuses
and
carriages
the
brilliant
morning
sunlight
dazzled
the
children
s
eyes
the
roar
of
wheels
and
the
clamor
of
car
bells
of
clattering
horses
feet
of
cries
and
shouts
and
passing
voices
mingled
in
a
volume
of
sound
that
deafened
them
the
great
tidal
wave
of
human
life
and
work
and
pleasure
almost
took
them
off
their
feet
they
knew
too
little
of
cities
to
have
had
beforehand
any
idea
of
what
the
overwhelming
rush
and
roar
would
be
and
what
slight
straws
they
would
feel
themselves
upon
the
current
if
they
had
been
quite
ordinary
children
they
might
well
have
been
frightened
but
they
were
not
ordinary
children
little
as
they
were
aware
of
that
important
factor
in
their
young
lives
they
were
awed
for
this
first
moment
but
somehow
they
were
fascinated
as
much
as
they
were
awed
while
they
stood
for
a
brief
looking
on
they
did
not
child
of
their
ages
can
possibly
know
such
things
of
him
or
nature
had
made
them
of
the
metal
out
of
which
she
moulds
strong
things
and
great
ones
as
they
had
not
comprehended
the
restless
sense
of
wrong
and
misery
the
careless
unlearning
and
ungrowing
life
in
aunt
matilda
s
world
filled
them
with
so
they
did
not
understand
that
because
they
had
been
born
creatures
who
belong
to
the
great
moving
working
venturing
world
they
were
not
afraid
of
it
and
felt
their
first
young
encounter
with
it
a
thing
which
thrilled
them
with
an
exultant
emotion
they
could
not
have
explained
this
is
not
aunt
matilda
s
world
said
rob
believe
it
is
ours
meg
don
t
you
meg
was
staring
with
entranced
eyes
at
the
passing
multitude
more
pilgrims
are
come
to
town
she
said
quoting
the
pilgrim
s
progress
with
a
look
in
her
intense
little
face
you
remember
what
it
said
rob
here
also
all
the
noise
of
them
that
walked
in
the
streets
was
more
pilgrims
are
come
to
oh
isn
t
it
like
it
it
was
and
the
exaltation
and
thrill
of
it
got
into
their
young
blood
and
made
them
feel
as
if
they
walked
on
air
and
that
every
passing
human
thing
meant
somehow
life
and
strength
to
them
their
appetites
were
sharpened
by
the
morning
air
and
they
consulted
as
to
what
their
breakfast
should
be
they
had
no
money
to
spend
at
restaurants
and
every
penny
must
be
weighed
and
calculated
let
s
walk
on
said
meg
until
we
see
a
bakery
that
looks
as
if
it
was
kept
by
poor
people
then
we
can
buy
some
bread
and
eat
it
with
our
eggs
all
right
said
robin
they
marched
boldly
on
the
crowd
jostled
them
and
there
was
so
much
noise
that
they
could
hardly
hear
each
other
speak
but
ah
how
the
sun
shone
and
how
the
pennons
fluttered
and
streamed
on
every
side
and
how
excited
and
full
of
living
the
people
s
faces
looked
it
seemed
splendid
only
to
be
alive
in
such
a
world
on
such
a
morning
the
sense
of
the
practical
which
had
suggested
that
they
should
go
to
a
small
place
led
them
into
the
side
streets
they
passed
all
the
big
shops
without
a
glance
but
at
last
meg
stooped
before
a
small
one
there
s
a
woman
in
there
she
said
i
just
saw
her
for
a
minute
she
has
a
nice
face
she
looked
as
if
she
might
be
let
s
go
in
there
robin
it
s
quite
a
small
they
went
in
it
was
a
small
place
but
a
clean
one
and
the
woman
had
a
face
she
was
a
german
and
was
broad
and
placid
and
comfortable
they
bought
some
fresh
rolls
from
her
and
as
she
served
them
and
was
making
the
change
meg
watched
her
anxiously
she
was
thinking
that
she
did
look
very
peaceable
indeed
so
instead
of
turning
away
from
the
counter
she
planted
herself
directly
before
her
and
asked
her
a
question
if
you
please
she
said
we
have
some
eggs
to
eat
with
our
bread
and
we
are
not
going
home
if
we
are
very
careful
would
you
mind
if
we
ate
our
breakfast
in
here
instead
of
outside
we
won
t
let
any
of
the
crumbs
or
shells
drop
on
the
you
not
going
home
said
the
woman
you
from
out
town
yes
answered
meg
you
look
like
you
wass
goun
to
der
fair
said
the
woman
with
a
smile
who
wass
with
you
no
one
said
robin
we
are
going
alone
but
we
re
all
my
crayshious
said
the
woman
but
you
wass
young
for
that
but
your
merican
childrens
is
queer
ones
yes
you
can
sit
down
an
eat
your
bregfast
that
make
no
matter
to
me
if
you
is
careful
you
can
sit
there
were
two
chairs
near
a
little
table
where
perhaps
occasional
customers
ate
buns
and
they
sat
down
to
their
rolls
and
eggs
and
salt
as
to
a
feast
i
was
hungry
said
rob
cracking
his
fourth
egg
so
was
i
said
meg
feeling
that
her
fresh
roll
was
very
delicious
it
was
a
delightful
breakfast
the
german
woman
watched
them
with
placid
curiosity
as
they
ate
it
she
had
been
a
peasant
in
her
own
country
and
had
lived
in
a
village
among
rosy
stout
and
bucolic
little
peters
and
gretchens
who
were
not
given
to
enterprise
and
the
american
child
was
a
revelation
to
her
and
somehow
also
these
two
had
an
attraction
all
american
children
had
not
they
looked
so
well
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
yet
had
such
good
manners
and
no
air
of
at
all
they
ate
their
rolls
and
eggs
with
all
the
gusto
of
very
young
appetite
but
they
evidently
meant
to
keep
their
part
of
the
bargain
and
leave
her
no
crumbs
and
shells
to
sweep
up
the
truth
was
that
they
were
perfectly
honorable
little
souls
and
had
a
sense
of
justice
they
were
in
the
midst
of
their
breakfast
when
they
were
rather
startled
by
hearing
her
voice
from
the
end
of
the
counter
where
she
had
been
standing
leaning
against
the
wall
her
arms
folded
you
like
a
cup
coffee
she
asked
illustration
you
like
a
cup
coffee
she
asked
they
both
looked
round
uncertain
what
to
say
not
knowing
whether
or
not
that
she
meant
that
she
sold
coffee
they
exchanged
rather
disturbed
glances
and
then
robin
answered
we
can
t
afford
it
thank
you
ma
am
he
said
we
ve
got
so
little
never
mind
she
astonished
them
by
answering
that
cost
me
nothing
there
some
coffee
left
on
the
back
of
the
stove
from
my
man
s
bregfast
i
give
you
each
a
and
she
actually
went
into
the
little
back
room
and
presently
brought
back
two
good
cups
of
hot
coffee
there
you
drink
that
she
said
setting
them
down
on
the
little
table
if
you
children
goun
to
der
fair
in
that
crowd
by
yourselves
you
want
something
in
your
it
was
so
was
so
seemed
such
luck
they
looked
at
each
other
with
beaming
eyes
and
at
her
with
quite
disproportionate
gratitude
it
was
much
more
than
two
cups
of
coffee
to
them
oh
thank
you
they
both
exclaimed
we
re
so
much
obliged
to
you
ma
am
their
feast
seemed
to
become
quite
a
royal
thing
they
never
had
felt
so
splendidly
fed
in
their
lives
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
never
tasted
such
coffee
when
the
meal
was
finished
they
rose
refreshed
enough
to
feel
ready
for
anything
they
went
up
to
the
counter
and
thanked
the
german
woman
again
it
was
meg
who
spoke
to
her
we
want
to
say
thank
you
again
she
said
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
letting
us
eat
our
breakfast
in
here
it
was
so
nice
to
sit
down
and
the
coffee
was
so
splendid
i
dare
say
we
do
seem
rather
young
to
be
by
ourselves
but
that
makes
us
all
the
more
that
s
all
right
said
the
woman
i
hope
you
don
t
get
lost
by
der
have
good
time
and
then
they
went
forth
on
their
pilgrimage
into
the
glorious
morning
into
the
rushing
world
that
seemed
so
splendid
and
so
the
that
only
themselves
and
those
like
them
could
see
isn
t
it
nice
when
some
one
s
kind
to
you
rob
meg
exclaimed
joyfully
when
they
got
into
the
sunshine
doesn
t
it
make
you
feel
happy
somehow
not
because
they
ve
done
something
but
just
because
they
ve
been
kind
yes
it
does
answered
rob
stepping
out
bravely
and
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
believe
there
are
a
lot
of
kind
people
in
the
so
do
i
said
meg
i
believe
they
re
in
it
even
when
we
don
t
see
and
all
the
more
with
springing
steps
and
brave
young
faces
they
walked
on
their
way
to
they
had
talked
it
all
they
would
enter
their
city
beautiful
it
would
be
no
light
thing
to
them
their
entrance
into
it
they
were
innocently
epicurean
about
it
and
wanted
to
see
it
at
the
very
first
in
all
its
loveliness
they
knew
that
there
were
gates
of
entrance
here
and
there
through
which
thousands
poured
each
day
but
meg
had
a
fancy
of
her
own
founded
of
course
upon
that
other
progress
of
the
pilgrim
s
robin
she
said
oh
we
must
go
in
by
the
water
just
like
those
other
pilgrims
who
came
to
town
you
know
that
part
at
the
last
where
it
says
and
so
many
went
over
the
water
and
were
let
in
at
the
golden
gates
let
us
go
over
the
water
and
be
let
in
at
the
golden
gates
but
the
water
we
shall
go
over
won
t
be
dark
and
bitter
it
will
be
blue
and
splendid
and
the
sun
will
be
shining
everywhere
ah
rob
how
it
be
true
that
we
are
here
they
knew
all
about
the
great
arch
of
entrance
and
stately
peristyle
they
had
read
in
the
newspapers
all
about
its
height
and
the
height
of
the
statues
adorning
it
they
knew
how
many
columns
formed
the
peristyle
but
it
was
not
height
or
breadth
or
depth
or
width
they
remembered
the
picture
which
remained
with
them
and
haunted
them
like
a
fair
dream
was
of
a
white
and
splendid
archway
crowned
with
one
of
the
great
stories
of
the
world
in
triumph
of
the
man
in
whom
the
god
was
so
strong
that
his
dreams
the
working
of
his
mind
his
strength
his
courage
his
suffering
wrested
from
the
silence
of
the
unknown
a
new
and
splendid
world
it
was
this
great
white
arch
they
always
thought
of
with
this
precious
marble
story
crowning
it
the
blue
blue
water
spread
before
the
stately
columns
at
its
side
and
the
city
beautiful
within
the
courts
it
guarded
and
it
was
to
this
they
were
going
when
they
found
their
way
to
the
boat
which
would
take
them
to
it
it
was
such
a
heavenly
day
of
june
the
water
was
so
amethystine
the
sky
such
a
vault
of
rapture
what
did
it
matter
to
them
that
they
were
jostled
and
crowded
and
counted
for
nothing
among
those
about
them
what
did
it
matter
that
there
were
often
near
them
common
faces
speaking
of
nothing
but
common
stupid
pleasure
or
common
sharpness
and
greed
what
did
it
matter
that
scarcely
any
one
saw
what
they
saw
or
seeing
it
realized
its
splendid
hopeful
meaning
little
recked
they
of
anything
but
the
entrancement
of
blue
sky
and
water
and
the
city
beautiful
they
were
drawing
near
to
when
first
out
of
the
blueness
there
rose
the
fair
shadow
of
the
whiteness
they
sprang
from
their
seats
and
hand
in
hand
made
their
way
to
the
side
and
there
stood
watching
as
silent
as
if
they
did
not
dare
to
speak
lest
it
should
melt
away
and
from
a
fair
white
spirit
it
grew
to
a
real
white
more
fair
more
stately
and
more
an
enchanted
thing
than
even
they
had
believed
or
hoped
and
the
crowd
surged
about
them
and
women
exclaimed
and
men
talked
and
there
was
a
rushing
to
and
fro
and
the
ringing
of
a
bell
and
movement
and
action
and
excitement
were
on
every
side
but
somehow
these
two
children
stood
hand
in
hand
and
only
looked
and
their
dream
had
come
true
though
it
had
been
a
child
s
dream
of
an
enchanted
thing
xi
they
passed
beneath
the
stateliness
of
the
great
arch
still
hand
in
hand
and
silent
they
walked
softly
almost
as
if
they
felt
themselves
treading
upon
holy
ground
to
their
youth
and
unworn
souls
it
like
holy
ground
they
had
so
dreamed
of
it
they
had
so
longed
for
it
it
had
been
so
mingled
in
their
minds
with
the
story
of
a
city
not
of
this
world
and
they
stood
within
the
court
beyond
the
archway
the
fair
and
noble
colonnade
its
sweep
of
columns
behind
them
the
wonder
of
the
city
beautiful
spread
before
the
water
of
blue
lagoons
lapped
the
bases
of
white
palaces
as
if
with
a
caress
of
homage
to
their
beauty
on
every
side
these
marvels
stood
everywhere
there
was
the
green
of
sward
and
plants
the
sapphire
of
water
the
flood
of
color
and
human
life
passing
by
and
above
it
all
and
enclosing
it
the
warm
deep
splendid
blueness
of
the
summer
sky
it
was
so
was
so
full
of
the
marvel
of
was
so
was
so
radiant
and
unearthly
in
its
beauty
the
two
children
only
stood
still
and
gazed
and
gazed
with
widening
eyes
and
parted
lips
they
could
not
have
moved
about
at
first
they
only
stood
and
lost
themselves
as
in
a
dream
meg
was
still
for
so
long
that
robin
turning
slowly
to
look
at
her
at
last
was
rather
awed
meg
he
said
meg
yes
she
answered
in
a
voice
only
half
awake
meg
meg
we
are
i
know
said
meg
only
it
is
so
other
it
seems
as
she
gave
a
queer
little
laugh
and
turned
to
look
at
him
rob
she
said
perhaps
we
are
and
have
just
wakened
that
brought
them
back
to
earth
they
laughed
together
no
they
were
not
dead
they
were
breathless
and
uplifted
by
an
ecstasy
but
they
had
never
been
so
fully
before
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
in
the
centre
of
the
world
and
the
world
was
such
a
bright
and
radiant
and
beautiful
place
as
they
had
never
dreamed
of
where
shall
we
go
first
said
meg
what
shall
we
do
but
it
was
so
difficult
to
decide
that
it
did
not
seem
possible
to
make
a
plan
and
follow
it
it
was
not
possible
for
them
at
least
they
were
too
happy
and
too
young
surely
visitors
to
could
not
make
plans
they
gave
themselves
up
to
the
spell
and
went
where
fancy
led
them
and
it
led
them
far
and
through
strange
beauties
which
seemed
like
dreams
come
true
they
wandered
down
broad
pathways
past
green
sward
waving
palms
glowing
masses
of
flowers
white
balustrades
bordering
lagoons
lightly
ruffled
by
a
moment
s
wind
wonderful
statues
stood
on
silent
guard
sometimes
in
groups
sometimes
majestic
colossal
figures
they
look
as
if
they
were
all
watching
the
thousands
and
thousands
go
by
said
robin
it
seems
as
if
they
must
be
thinking
something
about
it
all
meg
answered
it
could
not
be
that
they
could
stand
there
and
look
like
that
and
not
it
was
she
who
soon
after
built
up
for
them
the
only
scheme
they
made
during
those
enchanted
days
it
could
scarcely
be
called
a
plan
of
action
it
was
so
much
an
outcome
of
imagination
and
part
of
a
vision
but
it
was
a
great
joy
to
them
through
every
hour
of
their
pilgrimage
standing
upon
a
fairy
bridge
looking
over
shining
canals
crossed
by
these
fairy
bridges
again
and
again
the
gold
sun
lighting
columns
archways
towers
and
minarets
statues
and
rushing
fountains
flowers
and
palms
her
child
eyes
filled
with
a
deep
strange
glow
of
joy
and
dreaming
she
leaned
upon
the
balustrade
in
her
favorite
fashion
her
chin
upon
her
hands
we
need
not
it
is
a
fairy
story
robin
she
said
it
a
fairy
story
but
it
is
real
who
ever
thought
a
fairy
story
could
come
true
i
ve
made
up
how
it
came
to
be
like
tell
us
how
said
robin
looking
over
the
jewelled
water
almost
as
she
did
it
was
like
this
she
said
there
was
a
great
magician
who
was
the
ruler
of
all
the
genii
in
all
the
world
they
were
all
powerful
and
rich
and
wonderful
magicians
but
he
could
make
them
obey
him
and
give
him
what
they
stored
away
and
he
said
i
will
build
a
splendid
city
that
all
the
world
shall
flock
to
and
wonder
at
and
remember
forever
and
in
it
some
of
all
the
things
in
the
world
shall
be
seen
so
that
the
people
who
see
it
shall
learn
what
the
world
is
huge
it
is
and
what
wisdom
it
has
in
it
and
what
wonders
and
it
will
make
them
know
what
are
like
themselves
because
the
wonders
will
be
made
by
hands
and
feet
and
brains
just
like
their
own
and
so
they
will
understand
how
strong
they
they
only
knew
it
will
give
them
courage
and
fill
them
with
she
stopped
a
moment
and
rob
pushed
her
gently
with
his
elbow
go
on
he
said
i
like
it
it
sounds
quite
true
what
else
and
he
called
all
the
genii
together
and
called
them
by
their
names
there
was
one
who
was
the
king
of
all
the
pictures
and
statues
and
the
people
who
worked
at
making
them
they
did
not
know
they
had
a
genius
but
they
had
and
he
put
visions
into
their
heads
and
made
them
feel
restless
until
they
had
worked
them
out
into
statues
and
paintings
and
the
great
genius
said
to
him
you
must
build
a
palace
for
people
and
make
them
pour
their
finest
work
into
it
and
all
the
people
who
are
made
to
be
your
workers
whether
they
know
it
or
not
will
look
at
your
palace
and
see
what
other
ones
have
done
and
wonder
if
they
can
not
do
it
and
there
was
a
huge
huge
genius
who
was
made
of
steel
and
iron
and
gold
and
silver
and
wheels
and
the
magician
said
to
him
build
a
great
palace
and
make
your
workers
fill
it
with
all
the
machines
and
marvels
they
have
made
and
all
who
see
will
know
what
wonders
can
be
done
and
feel
that
there
is
no
wonder
that
isn
t
done
that
is
too
great
for
human
beings
to
and
there
was
a
genius
of
the
strange
countries
and
one
who
knew
all
the
plants
and
flowers
and
trees
that
grew
and
one
who
lived
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
knew
the
fishes
by
name
and
strode
about
among
them
and
each
one
was
commanded
to
build
a
palace
or
to
make
his
people
work
and
they
grew
so
interested
that
in
the
end
each
one
wanted
his
palace
and
his
people
to
be
the
most
wonderful
of
all
and
so
the
city
was
built
and
we
are
in
it
robin
though
we
are
only
twelve
years
old
and
nobody
cares
about
yes
said
robin
and
the
city
is
as
much
ours
as
if
we
were
the
magician
himself
meg
who
was
the
magician
was
he
i
don
t
know
said
meg
nobody
knows
he
is
she
gave
a
sudden
queer
little
touch
to
her
forehead
and
one
to
her
side
you
know
rob
the
thing
that
makes
us
want
to
do
things
and
be
things
don
t
you
suppose
so
rob
the
thing
that
made
us
want
so
to
come
here
that
we
could
not
bear
to
come
said
robin
the
thing
that
makes
you
make
up
stories
about
everything
and
always
have
queer
thoughts
said
meg
and
every
one
has
some
of
it
and
there
are
such
millions
of
people
and
so
there
is
enough
to
make
the
great
magician
robin
come
along
let
us
go
to
the
palace
the
picture
genius
built
and
see
what
his
people
put
in
it
let
us
be
part
of
the
fairy
story
when
we
go
anywhere
it
will
make
it
they
took
their
fairy
story
with
them
and
went
their
way
they
made
it
as
much
the
way
of
a
fairy
story
as
possible
they
found
a
gondola
with
a
gondolier
and
took
their
places
now
we
are
in
venice
meg
said
as
they
shot
smoothly
out
upon
the
lagoon
we
can
be
in
any
country
we
like
now
we
are
in
their
gondola
stopped
and
lay
rocking
on
the
lagoon
before
the
palace
s
broad
white
steps
they
mounted
them
and
entered
into
a
rich
glowing
world
all
unknown
they
knew
little
of
pictures
they
knew
nothing
of
statuary
but
they
went
from
room
to
room
throbbing
with
enjoyment
they
stopped
before
beautiful
faces
and
happy
scenes
and
vaguely
smiled
though
they
did
not
know
they
were
smiling
they
lingered
before
faces
and
figures
that
were
sad
and
their
own
dark
little
faces
grew
soft
and
grave
they
could
not
afford
to
buy
a
catalogue
so
they
could
only
look
and
pity
and
delight
or
wonder
we
must
make
up
the
stories
and
thoughts
of
them
ourselves
robin
said
let
s
take
it
in
turns
meg
yours
will
be
the
best
ones
of
illustration
now
we
are
in
and
this
was
what
they
did
as
they
passed
from
picture
to
picture
each
took
turns
at
building
up
explanations
some
of
them
might
have
been
at
once
surprising
and
instructive
to
the
artist
concerned
but
some
were
very
vivid
and
all
were
full
of
young
directness
and
clear
sight
and
the
fresh
imagining
and
coloring
of
the
unworn
mind
they
were
so
interested
that
it
became
like
a
sort
of
exciting
game
they
forgot
all
about
the
people
around
them
they
did
not
know
that
their
two
small
unchaperoned
figures
attracted
more
glances
than
one
they
were
so
accustomed
to
being
alone
that
they
never
exactly
counted
themselves
in
with
other
people
and
now
it
was
as
if
they
were
at
a
banquet
feasting
upon
strange
viands
and
the
new
flavors
were
like
wine
to
them
they
went
from
side
to
side
of
the
rooms
drawn
sometimes
by
a
glow
of
color
sometimes
by
a
hinted
story
we
don
t
know
anything
about
pictures
i
suppose
said
meg
but
we
can
see
everything
is
in
them
there
are
the
poor
working
in
the
fields
and
the
mills
being
glad
or
sorry
and
there
are
the
rich
ones
dancing
at
balls
and
standing
in
splendid
and
there
are
the
good
ones
and
the
bad
ones
you
can
see
it
in
their
faces
rob
went
on
for
her
yes
said
meg
richness
and
poorness
and
goodness
and
badness
and
happiness
and
gladness
the
genius
who
made
this
palace
was
a
very
proud
one
and
he
said
he
would
put
all
the
world
in
it
even
if
his
workers
could
only
make
pictures
and
was
he
the
strongest
of
all
asked
robin
taking
up
the
story
again
with
interest
i
don
t
know
meg
answered
sometimes
i
think
he
was
he
was
was
very
they
had
been
too
deeply
plunged
into
their
mood
to
notice
a
man
who
stood
near
them
looking
at
a
large
picture
in
fact
the
man
himself
had
not
at
first
noticed
them
but
when
meg
began
to
speak
her
voice
attracted
him
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
her
odd
little
reflecting
face
and
after
having
looked
at
it
he
stood
listening
to
her
an
expression
of
recognition
came
into
his
strong
face
you
two
again
he
said
when
she
had
finished
and
you
have
got
it
was
their
man
again
yes
answered
meg
her
gray
eyes
revealing
as
she
lifted
them
to
his
face
that
she
came
back
to
earth
with
some
difficulty
how
do
you
like
it
as
far
as
you
ve
gone
he
asked
we
are
making
believe
that
it
is
a
fairy
story
meg
answered
and
it
s
very
and
then
a
group
of
people
came
between
and
separated
them
xii
how
tired
they
were
when
they
came
out
from
the
world
of
pictures
into
the
world
of
thronging
people
how
their
limbs
ached
and
they
were
brought
back
to
the
realization
that
they
were
creatures
with
human
bodies
which
somehow
they
seemed
to
have
forgotten
when
they
stood
in
the
sunshine
again
robin
drew
a
long
breath
it
is
like
coming
out
of
one
dream
into
another
he
said
we
must
have
been
there
a
long
time
i
didn
t
know
i
was
tired
and
i
didn
t
know
i
was
hungry
but
i
am
both
are
you
she
was
as
tired
and
hungry
as
he
was
dare
we
buy
a
sandwich
to
eat
with
our
eggs
she
said
yes
i
think
we
dare
robin
answered
where
shall
we
go
and
eat
them
there
was
no
difficulty
in
deciding
she
had
planned
it
all
out
and
they
so
knew
the
place
by
heart
that
they
did
not
need
to
ask
their
way
it
was
over
one
of
the
fairy
bridges
which
led
to
a
fairy
island
it
was
softly
wooded
and
among
the
trees
were
winding
paths
and
flowers
and
rustic
seats
and
quaint
roofs
peering
above
the
greenness
of
branches
and
it
was
full
of
the
warm
scent
of
roses
growing
together
in
sumptuous
thousands
their
heavy
sweet
heads
uplifted
to
the
sun
or
nodding
and
leaning
towards
their
neighbors
clusters
the
fairy
bridge
linked
it
to
the
wonderful
world
beyond
but
by
comparison
its
bowers
were
almost
quiet
the
crowd
did
not
jostle
there
and
we
shall
be
eating
our
lunch
near
thousands
and
thousands
of
roses
it
will
be
like
the
arabian
let
us
pretend
that
the
rose
who
is
queen
of
them
all
invited
us
because
we
belong
to
nobody
meg
said
they
bought
the
modest
addition
to
their
meal
and
carried
the
necessary
satchel
to
their
bower
they
were
tired
of
dragging
the
satchel
about
but
they
were
afraid
to
lose
sight
of
it
it
s
very
well
that
it
is
such
a
small
one
and
that
we
have
so
little
in
it
robin
said
they
chose
the
most
secluded
corner
they
could
find
as
near
to
the
rose
garden
as
possible
and
sat
down
and
fell
upon
their
scant
lunch
as
they
had
fallen
upon
their
breakfast
it
was
very
scant
for
two
ravenously
hungry
children
and
they
tried
to
make
it
last
as
long
as
possible
but
scant
as
it
was
and
tired
as
they
were
their
spirits
did
not
fail
them
perhaps
if
we
eat
it
slowly
it
will
seem
more
said
meg
peeling
an
egg
with
deliberation
but
with
a
very
undeliberate
feeling
in
her
small
stomach
robin
did
you
notice
our
man
i
saw
him
of
course
answered
robin
he
s
too
big
not
to
i
him
continued
meg
robin
there
s
something
the
matter
with
that
man
he
s
a
gloomy
well
you
noticed
him
quickly
robin
responded
with
a
shade
of
fraternal
incredulity
what
s
happened
to
him
meg
s
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
a
glimpse
of
blue
water
she
saw
through
the
trees
she
looked
as
if
she
were
thinking
the
matter
over
how
do
i
know
she
said
i
couldn
t
but
somehow
he
has
a
dreary
face
as
if
he
had
been
thinking
of
dreary
things
i
don
t
know
why
i
thought
that
all
in
a
minute
but
i
did
and
i
believe
it
s
well
if
we
should
see
him
again
robin
said
i
ll
look
and
i
believe
we
shall
see
him
again
said
meg
how
many
eggs
have
we
left
robin
we
only
brought
three
dozen
he
answered
looking
into
the
satchel
and
we
ate
seven
this
when
you
have
nothing
but
eggs
you
eat
a
good
many
said
meg
reflectively
they
won
t
last
very
long
but
we
couldn
t
have
carried
a
thousand
eggs
even
if
we
had
had
them
was
a
sage
remark
we
shall
have
to
buy
some
cheap
things
was
robin
s
calculation
they
ll
have
to
be
very
cheap
though
we
have
to
pay
a
dollar
you
know
every
day
to
come
in
and
if
we
have
no
money
we
can
t
go
into
the
places
that
are
not
free
and
we
want
to
go
into
i
d
rather
go
in
hungry
than
stay
outside
and
have
real
dinners
wouldn
t
you
meg
put
it
to
him
yes
i
would
he
answered
though
it
s
pretty
hard
to
be
they
had
chosen
a
secluded
corner
to
sit
in
but
it
was
not
so
secluded
that
they
had
it
entirely
to
themselves
at
a
short
distance
from
them
in
the
nearest
bowery
nook
a
young
man
and
woman
were
eating
something
out
of
a
basket
they
looked
like
a
young
country
pair
plain
and
awkward
and
enjoying
themselves
immensely
their
clothes
were
common
and
their
faces
were
tanned
as
if
from
working
out
of
doors
but
their
basket
evidently
contained
good
things
to
eat
meg
caught
glimpses
of
ham
and
chicken
and
something
that
looked
like
cake
just
at
that
moment
they
looked
so
desperately
good
that
she
turned
away
her
eyes
because
she
did
not
want
to
stare
at
them
rudely
and
as
she
averted
them
she
saw
that
robin
had
seen
too
those
people
have
plenty
to
eat
he
said
with
a
short
awkward
laugh
yes
she
answered
don
t
let
us
look
we
are
robin
anyway
and
we
knew
we
couldn
t
come
as
other
people
yes
he
said
we
are
the
man
and
his
wife
finished
their
lunch
and
began
putting
things
in
order
in
their
basket
as
they
did
it
they
talked
together
in
a
low
voice
and
seemed
to
be
discussing
something
somehow
in
spite
of
her
averted
eyes
meg
suddenly
felt
as
if
they
were
discussing
robin
and
herself
and
she
wondered
if
they
had
caught
her
involuntary
look
i
think
robin
said
i
think
that
woman
is
going
to
speak
to
it
was
evident
that
she
was
she
got
up
and
came
towards
them
her
husband
following
her
rather
awkwardly
she
stopped
before
them
and
the
two
pairs
of
dark
eyes
lifted
themselves
to
her
face
i
ve
just
been
talking
to
my
man
about
you
two
she
said
we
couldn
t
help
looking
at
you
have
you
lost
your
friends
no
ma
am
said
robin
we
haven
t
got
any
i
mean
we
re
not
with
any
the
woman
turned
and
looked
at
her
husband
well
jem
she
exclaimed
the
man
drew
near
and
looked
them
over
he
was
a
big
young
man
with
a
countrified
face
you
haven
t
come
here
alone
he
said
yes
said
robin
we
couldn
t
have
come
if
we
hadn
t
come
alone
we
re
not
afraid
thank
you
we
re
getting
along
very
well
jem
said
the
woman
again
she
seemed
quite
stirred
there
was
something
in
her
ordinary
face
that
was
quite
like
a
sort
of
rough
emotion
have
you
plenty
of
money
she
asked
no
said
robin
not
plenty
but
we
have
a
she
put
her
basket
down
and
opened
it
she
took
out
some
pieces
of
brown
fried
chicken
then
she
took
out
some
big
slices
of
cake
with
raisins
in
it
she
even
added
some
biscuits
and
slices
of
ham
then
she
put
them
in
a
coarse
clean
napkin
now
look
here
she
said
don
t
you
go
filling
up
with
candy
and
peanuts
just
because
you
are
by
yourselves
you
put
this
in
your
bag
and
eat
it
when
you
re
ready
t
any
rate
it
s
good
victuals
and
won
t
harm
and
in
the
midst
of
their
shy
thanks
she
shut
the
basket
again
and
went
off
with
her
husband
and
they
heard
her
say
again
before
she
disappeared
well
jem
illustration
well
jem
she
exclaimed
xiii
yes
there
were
plenty
of
kind
people
in
the
world
and
one
of
the
best
proofs
of
it
was
that
in
that
busy
wonderful
place
through
which
all
the
world
seemed
passing
and
where
on
every
side
were
a
thousand
things
to
attract
attention
and
so
fill
eyes
and
mind
that
forgetfulness
and
carelessness
of
small
things
might
not
have
been
quite
unnatural
these
two
small
things
utterly
insignificant
and
unknown
to
the
crowds
they
threaded
met
many
a
passing
friend
of
the
moment
and
found
themselves
made
happier
by
many
a
kindly
and
helpful
word
or
look
officials
were
to
them
guides
were
motherly
women
and
fatherly
men
protected
them
in
awkward
crowds
they
always
saw
that
those
who
noticed
them
glanced
about
for
their
chaperons
and
again
and
again
they
were
asked
who
was
taking
care
of
them
but
robin
s
straightforward
civil
little
answer
we
re
taking
care
of
ourselves
never
failed
to
waken
as
much
friendly
interest
as
surprise
they
kept
up
their
fairy
story
of
the
great
genius
and
called
things
by
names
and
talked
to
each
other
of
their
fancies
about
them
it
was
so
much
more
delightful
to
say
let
us
go
to
the
palace
of
the
genius
of
the
sea
than
to
say
let
us
go
to
the
fisheries
and
once
in
the
palace
standing
among
great
rocks
and
pools
and
fountains
with
water
splashing
and
tumbling
over
strange
and
strange
swimming
beneath
their
eyes
in
green
it
was
easy
to
believe
in
the
genius
who
had
brought
them
all
together
he
was
very
huge
meg
said
making
a
picture
of
him
he
had
monstrous
eyes
that
looked
like
the
sea
when
it
is
blue
he
had
great
white
coral
teeth
and
he
had
silver
scaly
fishskin
wound
round
him
and
his
hair
was
long
and
green
and
brown
they
stood
in
grottoes
and
looked
down
into
clear
pools
at
things
of
gold
and
silver
and
strange
prismatic
colors
meg
made
up
stories
of
tropical
rivers
with
palms
and
jungle
cane
fringing
them
and
tigers
and
lions
coming
to
lap
at
the
brink
she
invented
rushing
mountain
streams
and
lakes
with
speckled
trout
leaping
and
deep
deep
seas
where
whales
lay
rocking
far
below
and
porpoises
rolled
and
spread
hideous
tentacles
for
prey
oh
what
a
day
it
was
what
wonders
they
saw
and
hung
over
and
dwelt
on
with
passions
of
young
delight
the
great
sea
gave
up
its
deep
to
them
great
forests
and
trackless
jungles
their
wonderful
growths
kings
palaces
and
queens
coffers
their
rarest
treasures
the
ages
of
long
ago
their
relics
and
strange
legends
in
stone
and
wood
and
brass
and
gold
they
did
not
know
how
often
people
turned
and
stopped
to
look
at
their
two
little
figures
and
vivid
dark
faces
they
certainly
never
chanced
to
see
that
one
figure
was
often
behind
them
at
a
safe
distance
and
seemed
rather
to
have
fallen
into
the
habit
of
going
where
they
went
and
listening
to
what
they
said
it
was
their
man
curiously
enough
and
it
was
true
that
he
was
rather
a
man
when
one
observed
him
well
his
keen
face
had
a
cloud
resting
upon
it
he
looked
listless
and
unsmiling
even
in
the
palaces
that
most
stirred
the
children
s
souls
and
in
fact
it
seemed
to
be
their
odd
enthusiasm
which
had
attracted
him
a
little
because
he
was
in
the
mood
to
feel
none
himself
he
had
been
within
hearing
distance
when
meg
had
been
telling
her
stories
of
the
genius
of
the
palace
of
the
sea
and
a
faint
smile
had
played
about
his
mouth
for
a
moment
then
he
had
drawn
a
trifle
nearer
still
keeping
out
of
sight
and
when
they
had
moved
he
had
followed
them
he
had
been
a
hard
ambitious
man
all
his
life
a
few
years
before
he
had
found
a
new
happiness
which
softened
him
for
a
while
and
made
his
world
seem
a
brighter
thing
then
a
black
sorrow
had
come
upon
him
and
everything
had
changed
he
had
come
to
the
enchanted
city
not
as
the
children
had
come
because
it
shone
before
them
a
radiant
joy
but
because
he
wondered
if
it
would
distract
him
at
all
all
other
things
had
failed
his
old
habits
of
work
and
scheme
his
successes
his
fortune
they
were
all
as
nothing
the
world
was
empty
to
him
and
he
walked
about
it
feeling
like
a
ghost
the
little
dark
vivid
faces
had
attracted
him
he
did
not
know
why
and
when
he
heard
the
story
of
the
palace
of
the
sea
he
was
led
on
by
a
vague
interest
he
was
near
them
often
during
the
day
but
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
afternoon
that
they
saw
him
themselves
when
he
did
not
see
them
they
came
upon
him
in
a
quiet
spot
where
he
was
sitting
alone
on
a
seat
near
him
sat
a
young
woman
resting
with
a
baby
asleep
in
her
arms
the
young
woman
was
absorbed
in
her
child
and
was
apparently
unconscious
of
him
his
arms
were
folded
and
his
head
bent
but
he
was
looking
at
her
in
an
absent
miserable
way
it
was
as
if
she
made
him
think
of
something
bitter
and
sad
meg
and
robin
passed
him
quietly
illustration
he
was
looking
at
her
in
an
absent
miserable
way
i
see
what
you
meant
meg
robin
said
he
does
look
as
if
something
was
the
matter
with
him
i
wonder
what
it
is
when
they
passed
out
of
the
gates
at
dusk
it
was
with
bodies
but
enraptured
souls
in
the
which
they
indulged
in
the
extravagance
of
taking
the
tired
people
sitting
exhaustedly
in
the
seats
and
hanging
on
to
straps
looked
with
a
sort
of
wonder
at
them
their
faces
shone
so
like
stars
they
did
not
know
where
they
were
going
to
sleep
and
they
were
more
than
ready
for
lying
down
but
they
were
happy
beyond
words
they
went
with
the
car
until
it
reached
the
city
s
heart
and
then
they
got
out
and
walked
the
streets
were
lighted
and
the
thoroughfares
were
a
riot
of
life
and
sound
people
were
going
to
theatres
restaurants
and
hotels
which
were
a
blaze
of
electric
radiance
they
found
themselves
limping
a
little
but
they
kept
stoutly
on
holding
firmly
to
the
satchel
we
needn
t
be
afraid
of
going
anywhere
however
poor
it
looks
robin
said
with
a
grave
little
elderly
air
he
was
curiously
grave
for
his
years
sometimes
anybody
can
see
we
have
nothing
to
steal
i
think
any
one
would
know
that
we
only
want
to
go
to
it
was
a
queer
place
they
finally
hit
upon
it
was
up
a
side
street
which
was
poorly
lighted
and
where
the
houses
were
all
shabby
and
small
on
the
steps
of
one
of
them
a
woman
was
sitting
with
a
pale
boy
beside
her
robin
stopped
before
her
have
you
a
room
where
my
sister
could
sleep
and
i
could
have
a
mattress
on
the
floor
or
lie
down
on
anything
he
said
we
can
t
afford
to
go
anywhere
where
it
will
cost
more
than
fifty
cents
the
woman
looked
at
them
indifferently
she
was
evidently
very
much
worn
out
with
her
day
s
work
and
discouraged
by
things
generally
i
haven
t
anything
worth
more
than
fifty
cents
goodness
knows
she
answered
you
must
be
short
of
money
to
come
here
i
ve
never
thought
of
having
we
re
poor
said
robin
and
we
know
we
can
t
have
anything
but
a
poor
room
if
we
can
lie
down
we
are
so
tired
we
shall
go
to
sleep
anywhere
we
ve
been
at
the
fair
all
the
pale
little
boy
leaned
forward
resting
his
arm
on
his
mother
s
knee
they
saw
that
he
was
a
very
poor
little
fellow
indeed
with
a
hunch
back
mother
he
said
let
em
stay
i
ll
sleep
on
the
the
woman
gave
a
dreary
half
laugh
and
got
up
from
the
step
he
s
crazy
about
the
fair
she
said
we
hain
t
no
money
to
spend
on
fairs
and
he
s
most
wild
about
it
you
can
stay
here
if
you
want
she
made
a
sign
to
them
to
follow
her
the
hunchback
boy
rose
too
and
went
into
the
dark
passage
after
them
he
seemed
to
regard
them
with
a
kind
of
hunger
in
his
look
they
went
up
the
narrow
steep
staircase
it
was
only
lighted
by
a
dim
gleam
from
a
room
below
whose
door
was
open
the
balustrades
were
rickety
and
some
of
them
were
broken
out
it
was
a
forlorn
enough
place
the
hunchback
boy
came
up
the
steps
awkwardly
behind
them
it
was
as
if
he
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
they
went
up
two
flights
of
the
crooked
crazy
stairs
and
at
the
top
of
the
second
flight
the
woman
opened
a
door
that
s
all
the
place
there
is
she
said
it
isn
t
anything
more
than
a
place
to
lie
down
in
you
see
i
can
put
a
mattress
on
the
floor
for
you
and
your
sister
can
sleep
in
the
that
s
all
we
want
replied
robin
but
it
was
a
poor
place
a
room
both
small
and
bare
and
with
broken
windows
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
the
cot
and
a
chair
ben
sleeps
here
the
woman
said
if
i
couldn
t
make
him
a
place
on
the
floor
near
me
i
couldn
t
let
it
to
meg
turned
and
looked
at
ben
he
was
gazing
at
her
with
a
nervous
interest
we
re
much
obliged
to
you
she
said
it
s
all
right
he
said
with
eager
shyness
do
you
want
some
water
to
wash
yourselves
with
i
can
bring
you
up
a
tin
basin
and
a
jug
you
can
set
it
on
the
thank
you
they
both
said
at
once
and
robin
added
we
want
washing
pretty
ben
turned
about
and
went
for
the
water
as
if
he
felt
a
sort
of
excitement
in
doing
the
service
these
two
children
who
looked
as
poor
as
himself
set
stirring
strange
thoughts
in
his
small
unnourished
brain
he
brought
back
the
tin
basin
and
water
a
piece
of
yellow
soap
and
even
a
coarse
rather
dingy
towel
he
had
been
so
eager
that
he
was
out
of
breath
when
he
returned
but
he
put
the
basin
on
the
chair
and
the
tin
jug
beside
it
with
a
sort
of
exultant
look
in
his
poor
face
thank
you
said
meg
again
thank
you
she
could
not
help
watching
him
as
his
mother
prepared
the
rather
wretched
mattress
for
robin
once
he
caught
the
look
of
her
big
childish
gray
eyes
as
it
rested
upon
him
with
questioning
sympathy
and
he
flushed
up
so
that
even
by
the
light
of
the
little
smoky
lamp
she
saw
it
when
the
woman
had
finished
she
and
the
boy
went
away
and
left
them
and
they
stood
a
moment
looking
at
each
other
they
were
both
thinking
of
the
same
thing
but
somehow
they
did
not
put
it
into
words
we
ll
wash
off
the
dust
first
said
robin
and
then
we
ll
eat
some
of
the
things
we
have
left
from
what
the
woman
gave
us
and
then
we
ll
go
to
bed
and
we
shall
drop
just
like
and
this
they
did
and
it
was
certainly
a
very
short
time
before
the
smoky
little
lamp
was
out
and
each
had
dropped
like
a
log
and
lay
stretched
in
the
darkness
with
a
sense
of
actual
ecstasy
in
limbs
laid
down
to
rest
and
muscles
relaxed
for
sleeping
robin
said
meg
drowsily
through
the
dark
that
divided
them
everybody
in
the
world
has
something
to
give
to
somebody
i
m
thinking
that
too
robin
answered
just
as
sleepily
nobody
is
so
t
anything
he
let
us
have
his
hard
bed
meg
murmured
and
t
but
her
voice
died
away
and
robin
would
not
have
heard
her
if
she
had
said
more
and
they
were
both
fast
fast
asleep
xiv
it
would
have
been
a
loud
sound
which
would
have
awakened
them
during
those
deep
sleeping
hours
of
the
night
they
did
not
even
stir
on
their
poor
pillows
when
long
after
midnight
there
was
the
noise
of
heavy
drunken
footsteps
and
heavy
drunken
stumbling
in
the
passage
below
and
then
the
raising
of
a
man
s
rough
voice
and
the
upsetting
of
chairs
and
the
slamming
of
doors
mingled
with
the
expostulations
of
the
woman
whose
husband
had
come
home
in
something
worse
than
his
frequent
they
slept
sweetly
through
it
all
but
when
the
morning
came
and
hours
of
unbroken
rest
had
made
their
slumbers
lighter
and
the
sunshine
streamed
in
through
the
broken
windows
they
were
called
back
to
the
world
by
loud
and
angry
sounds
what
is
it
said
meg
sitting
bolt
upright
and
rubbing
her
eyes
somebody
s
and
somebody
s
crying
said
robin
sitting
up
too
but
more
slowly
it
was
quite
clear
to
them
as
soon
as
they
were
fully
awake
that
both
these
things
were
happening
a
man
seemed
to
be
quarrelling
below
they
could
hear
him
stamping
about
and
swearing
savagely
and
they
could
hear
the
woman
s
voice
which
sounded
as
if
she
were
trying
to
persuade
him
to
do
or
leave
undone
something
they
could
not
hear
her
words
but
she
was
crying
and
somebody
else
was
crying
too
and
they
knew
it
was
the
boy
with
the
little
old
face
and
the
i
suppose
it
s
the
woman
s
husband
said
meg
i
m
glad
he
wasn
t
here
last
i
wonder
if
he
knows
we
are
here
said
robin
listening
anxiously
it
was
plain
that
he
did
know
they
heard
him
stumbling
up
the
staircase
grumbling
and
swearing
as
he
came
and
he
was
coming
up
to
their
room
it
was
evident
what
shall
we
do
exclaimed
meg
in
a
whisper
wait
robin
answered
breathlessly
we
can
t
do
the
heavy
feet
blundered
up
the
short
second
flight
and
blundered
to
their
door
it
seemed
that
the
man
had
not
slept
off
his
drunken
fit
he
struck
the
door
with
his
fist
hand
out
that
dollar
he
shouted
when
my
wife
takes
roomers
i
m
going
to
be
paid
hand
it
they
heard
the
woman
hurrying
up
the
stairs
after
him
she
was
out
of
breath
with
crying
and
there
was
a
choking
sound
in
her
voice
when
she
spoke
to
them
through
the
door
you
d
better
let
him
have
it
she
said
i
guess
they
d
better
said
the
man
roughly
who
d
they
suppose
owns
the
house
robin
got
up
and
took
a
dollar
from
their
very
small
store
which
was
hidden
in
the
lining
of
his
trousers
he
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
a
little
and
held
the
money
out
here
it
is
he
said
the
man
snatched
it
out
of
his
hand
and
turned
away
and
went
stumbling
down
stairs
still
growling
the
woman
stood
a
minute
on
the
landing
and
they
heard
her
make
a
pitiful
sort
of
sound
half
sob
half
sniff
meg
sat
up
in
bed
with
her
chin
on
her
hands
and
glared
like
a
little
lioness
what
do
you
think
of
she
said
he
s
a
devil
said
robin
with
terseness
and
he
was
conscious
of
no
impropriety
i
wanted
that
boy
to
have
it
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
say
where
so
did
i
answered
meg
and
i
believe
his
mother
would
have
given
it
to
him
they
heard
the
man
leave
the
house
a
few
minutes
later
and
then
it
did
not
take
them
long
to
dress
and
go
down
the
narrow
stairs
again
as
they
descended
the
first
flight
they
saw
the
woman
cooking
something
over
the
stove
in
her
kitchen
and
as
she
moved
about
they
saw
her
brush
her
apron
across
her
eyes
the
squalid
street
was
golden
with
the
early
morning
sunshine
which
is
such
a
joyful
thing
and
in
the
full
happy
flood
of
it
a
miserable
little
figure
sat
crouched
on
the
steps
it
was
the
boy
ben
and
they
saw
that
he
looked
paler
than
he
had
looked
the
night
before
and
his
little
face
looked
older
his
elbow
was
on
his
knee
and
his
cheek
on
his
hand
and
there
were
wet
marks
on
his
cheeks
a
large
lump
rose
up
in
meg
s
throat
i
know
what
s
the
matter
she
whispered
to
robin
do
i
robin
answered
rather
unsteadily
and
he
s
poorer
than
anybody
else
it
not
to
go
by
no
no
said
meg
it
oughtn
she
walked
straight
to
the
threshold
and
sat
down
on
the
step
beside
him
she
was
a
straightforward
child
and
she
was
too
much
moved
to
stand
on
ceremony
she
sat
down
quite
close
by
the
poor
little
fellow
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
never
you
mind
she
said
never
you
and
her
throat
felt
so
full
that
for
a
few
seconds
she
could
say
nothing
more
robin
stood
against
the
door
post
the
effect
of
this
was
to
make
his
small
jaw
square
itself
don
t
mind
us
at
all
he
said
the
little
fellow
looked
at
meg
and
then
up
at
him
in
that
look
he
saw
that
they
did
know
mother
was
going
to
give
that
dollar
to
me
he
said
brokenly
i
was
going
to
the
fair
on
it
is
going
everybody
is
talking
about
it
and
thinking
about
it
nobody
s
been
talking
of
nothing
else
for
months
and
months
the
streets
are
full
of
people
on
their
way
and
they
all
pass
me
he
rubbed
his
sleeve
across
his
forlorn
face
and
swallowed
hard
there
s
pictures
in
the
shops
he
went
on
and
flags
flying
and
everything
s
going
that
way
and
me
staying
behind
two
of
the
large
splendid
drops
which
had
sometimes
gathered
on
meg
s
eyelashes
and
fallen
on
the
straw
when
she
had
been
telling
stories
in
the
barn
fell
now
upon
her
lap
robin
she
said
robin
stood
and
stared
very
straight
before
him
for
a
minute
and
then
his
eyes
turned
and
met
hers
we
re
very
poor
he
said
to
her
but
we
couldn
t
leave
him
behind
meg
said
we
let
s
and
she
put
her
head
down
resting
her
elbows
on
her
knee
and
clutching
her
forehead
with
her
supple
strong
little
hands
what
can
we
do
without
said
robin
let
s
do
without
meg
lifted
her
head
we
will
eat
nothing
but
the
eggs
for
breakfast
she
said
and
go
without
we
can
perhaps
we
can
we
ll
try
and
we
will
not
go
into
some
of
the
places
we
have
to
pay
to
go
into
i
will
make
up
stories
about
them
for
you
and
robin
it
has
something
to
give
that
s
what
i
stories
i
make
up
it
s
a
it
isn
t
so
little
robin
answered
it
fills
in
the
empty
place
meg
with
a
question
in
his
voice
she
answered
with
a
little
nod
and
then
put
her
hand
on
ben
s
arm
again
during
their
rapid
interchange
of
words
he
had
been
gazing
at
them
in
a
dazed
uncomprehending
way
to
his
poor
little
starved
nature
they
seemed
so
strong
and
different
from
himself
that
there
was
something
wonderful
about
them
meg
s
glowing
dark
little
face
quite
made
his
weak
heart
beat
as
she
turned
it
upon
him
we
are
not
much
better
off
than
you
are
she
said
but
we
think
we
ve
got
enough
to
take
you
into
the
grounds
you
let
us
have
your
bed
come
along
with
fair
he
said
tremulously
yes
she
answered
and
when
we
get
in
i
ll
try
and
think
up
things
to
tell
you
and
robin
about
the
places
we
can
t
afford
to
go
into
we
can
go
into
the
palaces
for
palaces
he
gasped
his
wide
eyes
on
her
face
she
laughed
that
s
what
we
call
them
she
said
that
s
what
they
are
it
s
part
of
a
story
i
ll
tell
it
to
you
as
we
oh
he
breathed
out
with
a
sort
of
gasp
again
he
evidently
did
not
know
how
to
express
himself
his
hands
trembled
and
he
looked
half
frightened
if
you
ll
do
it
he
said
i
ll
remember
you
all
my
life
i
it
wasn
t
for
father
i
know
mother
would
let
you
sleep
here
every
night
for
nothing
and
i
d
give
you
my
bed
and
be
glad
to
do
it
i
would
i
ll
be
so
thankful
to
you
i
hain
t
got
nothin
i
ll
be
that
was
a
kind
of
hysterical
break
in
his
let
me
go
and
tell
mother
he
said
and
he
got
up
stumblingly
and
rushed
into
the
house
meg
and
robin
followed
him
to
the
kitchen
as
excited
as
he
was
the
woman
had
just
put
a
cracked
bowl
of
something
hot
on
the
table
and
as
he
came
in
she
spoke
to
him
illustration
fair
he
said
tremulously
your
mush
is
ready
she
said
come
and
eat
while
it
s
mother
he
cried
out
they
are
going
to
take
me
in
i
m
going
they
re
going
to
take
me
the
woman
stopped
short
and
looked
at
the
twins
who
stood
in
the
doorway
it
seemed
as
if
her
chin
rather
trembled
you
re
she
began
and
broke
off
you
re
as
poor
as
he
is
she
ended
you
must
be
or
you
wouldn
t
have
come
here
to
we
re
as
poor
in
one
way
said
meg
but
we
worked
and
saved
money
to
come
it
isn
t
much
but
we
can
do
without
something
that
would
cost
fifty
cents
and
that
will
pay
for
his
the
woman
s
chin
trembled
more
still
well
she
said
lord
and
she
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
and
sat
down
suddenly
meg
went
over
to
her
not
exactly
knowing
why
we
could
not
bear
to
go
ourselves
she
said
and
he
is
like
she
was
thinking
as
she
spoke
that
this
woman
and
her
boy
were
very
fond
of
each
other
the
hands
holding
the
apron
were
trembling
as
his
had
done
they
dropped
as
suddenly
as
they
had
been
thrown
up
the
woman
lifted
her
face
eagerly
what
were
you
thinking
of
going
without
she
asked
was
it
things
to
eat
ve
got
some
eggs
faltered
meg
a
little
guiltily
there
s
hot
mush
in
the
pan
said
the
woman
there
s
nothing
to
eat
with
it
but
it
s
healthier
than
cold
eggs
sit
down
and
eat
and
they
did
and
in
half
an
hour
they
left
the
poor
house
feeling
and
fresh
with
them
went
mother
standing
on
the
steps
looking
after
pale
old
face
almost
flushed
and
young
as
it
set
itself
toward
the
city
beautiful
xv
before
they
entered
the
court
of
honor
meg
stopped
them
both
she
was
palpitating
with
excitement
robin
she
said
let
us
make
him
shut
his
eyes
then
you
can
take
one
of
his
hands
and
i
can
take
the
other
and
we
will
lead
him
and
when
we
have
taken
him
to
the
most
heavenly
place
he
shall
i
should
like
that
said
ben
tremulous
with
anticipation
all
right
said
robin
by
this
time
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
friends
all
their
lives
they
knew
each
other
they
had
not
ceased
talking
a
moment
since
they
set
out
but
it
had
not
been
about
the
fair
meg
had
decided
that
nothing
should
be
described
beforehand
that
all
the
entrancement
of
beauty
should
burst
upon
ben
s
hungry
soul
as
paradise
bursts
upon
translated
spirits
i
don
t
want
it
to
be
gradual
she
said
anxiously
i
want
it
to
be
it
can
be
gradual
she
was
an
artist
and
an
epicure
in
embryo
this
child
she
tasted
her
joys
with
a
delicate
palate
and
lost
no
flavor
of
them
the
rapture
of
yesterday
was
intensified
because
she
felt
it
throbbing
anew
in
this
frail
body
beside
her
in
which
nature
had
imprisoned
a
soul
as
full
of
longings
as
her
own
but
not
so
full
of
power
they
took
ben
by
either
hand
and
led
him
with
the
greatest
care
he
shut
his
eyes
tight
and
walked
between
them
people
who
glanced
at
them
smiled
recognizing
the
and
familiar
child
trick
they
did
not
know
that
this
time
it
was
something
more
than
that
the
trouble
is
meg
said
in
a
low
voice
to
robin
i
don
t
know
which
is
the
most
heavenly
place
to
stand
sometimes
i
think
it
is
at
one
end
and
sometimes
at
the
other
and
sometimes
at
the
they
led
their
charge
for
some
minutes
indefinitely
sometimes
they
paused
and
looked
about
them
speaking
in
undertones
ben
was
rigidly
faithful
and
kept
his
eyes
shut
as
they
hesitated
for
a
moment
near
one
of
the
buildings
a
man
who
was
descending
the
steps
looked
in
their
direction
and
his
look
was
one
of
recognition
it
was
the
man
who
had
watched
them
the
day
before
and
he
paused
upon
the
steps
interested
again
and
conscious
of
being
curious
what
are
they
going
to
do
he
said
to
himself
they
are
going
to
do
something
where
did
they
pick
up
the
other
little
chap
meg
had
been
looking
very
thoughtful
during
that
moment
of
hesitancy
she
spoke
and
he
was
near
enough
to
hear
her
he
shall
open
them
where
he
can
hear
the
water
splashing
in
the
fountain
she
said
i
think
that
s
the
it
seemed
that
robin
thought
so
too
they
turned
and
took
their
way
to
the
end
of
the
court
where
the
dome
lifted
itself
wonderful
against
the
sky
and
a
splendor
of
rushing
water
from
which
magnificent
rose
stood
grand
before
their
man
followed
them
he
had
had
a
bad
night
and
had
come
out
into
a
dark
world
the
streams
of
the
gayly
fluttering
flags
the
exhilaration
in
the
very
air
seemed
to
make
his
world
blacker
and
more
empty
a
year
before
he
had
planned
to
see
this
wonder
with
the
one
soul
on
earth
who
would
have
been
most
thrilled
and
who
would
have
made
him
most
thrill
to
its
deepest
and
highest
meaning
green
grass
and
summer
roses
were
waving
over
the
earth
that
had
shut
in
all
dreams
like
these
for
him
as
he
wandered
about
he
had
told
himself
that
he
had
been
mad
to
come
and
see
it
all
so
alone
sometimes
he
turned
away
from
the
crowd
and
sat
in
some
quiet
corner
of
palace
or
fairy
garden
and
it
was
because
he
was
forced
to
do
it
for
it
was
at
times
when
he
was
in
no
condition
to
be
looked
at
by
careless
he
had
never
been
particularly
fond
of
children
but
somehow
these
two
waifs
with
their
alert
faces
and
odd
independence
had
wakened
his
interest
he
was
conscious
of
rather
wanting
to
know
where
they
had
come
from
and
what
they
would
do
next
the
bit
of
the
story
of
the
genius
of
the
palace
of
the
sea
had
attracted
him
he
had
learned
to
love
stories
from
the
one
who
should
have
seen
with
him
the
enchanted
city
she
had
been
a
story
lover
and
full
of
fancies
he
followed
the
trio
to
the
end
of
the
great
court
when
they
reached
there
three
pairs
of
cheeks
were
flushed
and
the
eyes
that
were
open
were
glowing
meg
and
robin
chose
a
spot
of
ground
and
stopped
now
said
meg
open
the
boy
opened
them
the
man
saw
the
look
that
flashed
into
his
face
it
was
a
strange
quivering
look
palaces
which
seemed
of
pure
marble
surrounded
him
he
had
never
even
dreamed
of
palaces
white
stairways
rose
from
the
lagoon
leading
to
fair
open
portals
the
wondering
world
passed
through
to
splendors
held
within
a
great
statue
of
gold
towered
noble
and
marvellous
with
uplifted
arms
holding
high
the
emblems
of
its
spirit
and
power
and
at
the
end
of
this
vista
through
the
archway
and
between
the
line
of
columns
bearing
statues
poised
against
the
background
of
sky
he
caught
glimpses
of
the
lake
s
scintillating
blue
he
uttered
a
weird
little
sound
it
was
part
exclamation
and
a
bit
of
a
laugh
cut
short
by
something
like
a
nervous
sob
which
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
itself
oh
he
said
and
then
oh
again
and
then
don
t
it
and
he
cleared
his
throat
and
stared
and
meg
saw
his
narrow
chest
heave
up
and
down
it
isn
t
anything
something
we
ve
dreamed
of
perhaps
said
meg
gazing
in
ecstasy
with
him
answered
ben
but
i
ve
never
dreamed
like
meg
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
but
you
will
now
she
said
you
will
and
their
man
had
been
near
enough
to
hear
and
he
came
to
them
good
morning
he
said
you
re
having
another
day
of
it
i
meg
and
robin
looked
up
at
him
radiant
they
were
both
in
good
enough
mood
to
make
friends
they
felt
friends
with
everybody
good
morning
they
answered
and
robin
added
we
re
going
to
come
every
day
as
long
as
we
can
make
our
money
that
s
a
good
enough
idea
said
their
man
where
are
your
father
and
mother
meg
lifted
her
solemn
eyes
to
his
she
was
noticing
again
about
the
dreary
look
in
his
face
they
died
nearly
four
years
ago
she
answered
for
robin
who
is
with
you
asked
the
man
meeting
her
questioning
gaze
with
a
feeling
that
her
great
eyes
were
oddly
thoughtful
for
a
child
s
and
that
there
was
a
look
in
them
he
had
seen
before
in
a
pair
of
eyes
closed
a
year
ago
it
gave
him
an
almost
startled
feeling
nobody
is
with
us
meg
said
except
you
came
alone
said
the
man
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
turned
away
and
looked
across
the
court
to
where
the
lake
gleamed
through
the
colonnade
so
did
i
he
said
reflectively
so
did
i
quite
meg
and
robin
glanced
at
each
other
yesterday
rob
and
i
came
by
ourselves
said
meg
next
and
she
said
it
gently
but
we
were
not
lonely
and
we
have
the
man
turned
his
eyes
on
the
boy
you
re
ben
are
you
he
said
yes
ben
answered
and
but
for
them
i
couldn
t
never
have
seen
why
the
man
asked
almost
everybody
can
see
but
not
me
said
ben
and
i
wanted
to
more
than
any
like
to
me
and
when
they
roomed
at
our
house
last
night
mother
was
going
to
give
me
the
fifty
cents
he
took
it
away
from
us
and
they
brought
then
the
man
turned
on
robin
have
you
plenty
of
money
he
asked
unceremoniously
no
said
rob
they
re
as
poor
as
i
am
put
in
ben
they
couldn
t
afford
to
room
anywhere
but
with
poor
but
meg
began
impulsively
and
then
stopped
remembering
that
it
was
not
robin
she
was
talking
to
but
said
the
man
it
was
robin
who
answered
for
her
this
time
she
said
that
last
night
he
explained
with
a
half
shy
laugh
that
everybody
had
something
they
could
give
to
somebody
oh
well
it
isn
t
always
money
of
course
or
anything
big
said
meg
hurriedly
it
might
be
something
that
is
ever
so
the
man
laughed
but
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
remembering
something
as
he
looked
over
the
lagoon
again
that
s
a
pretty
good
thing
to
think
he
said
now
turning
on
meg
rather
suddenly
i
wonder
what
you
have
to
give
to
i
don
t
know
she
answered
perhaps
a
trifle
wistfully
the
thing
i
give
to
rob
and
ben
is
a
very
little
she
makes
up
things
to
tell
us
about
the
places
we
can
t
pay
to
go
into
or
don
t
understand
said
robin
it
s
not
as
little
as
she
thinks
it
well
said
the
man
look
here
perhaps
that
s
what
you
have
to
give
to
me
you
came
to
this
place
alone
and
so
did
i
believe
you
re
enjoying
yourselves
more
than
i
am
you
re
going
to
take
ben
about
and
tell
him
stories
suppose
you
take
me
you
meg
exclaimed
but
you
re
a
man
and
you
know
all
about
it
i
dare
say
and
i
only
tell
things
i
make
stories
and
other
things
a
man
wouldn
t
care
for
them
he
knows
too
much
s
the
trouble
said
the
man
a
fairy
or
so
might
do
me
good
i
m
not
acquainted
enough
with
them
and
if
i
know
things
you
don
that
s
what
i
have
to
give
to
why
said
meg
her
eyes
growing
as
she
looked
up
at
his
odd
clever
face
do
you
want
to
go
about
with
us
illustration
take
me
with
yes
said
the
man
with
a
quick
decided
nod
i
believe
that
s
just
what
i
want
to
do
i
m
lonelier
than
you
two
at
least
you
are
together
come
on
children
but
it
was
to
meg
he
held
out
his
hand
take
me
with
and
bewildered
as
she
was
meg
found
herself
giving
her
hand
to
him
and
being
led
away
robin
and
ben
close
beside
them
xvi
it
was
such
a
strange
unlike
the
things
of
every
day
and
so
totally
an
unexpected
thing
that
for
a
little
while
they
all
three
had
a
sense
of
scarcely
knowing
what
to
do
with
themselves
if
robin
and
meg
had
not
somehow
rather
liked
the
man
and
vaguely
felt
him
friendly
and
if
there
had
not
been
in
their
impressionable
minds
that
fancy
about
his
being
far
from
as
happy
as
the
other
people
of
the
crowds
looked
it
is
more
than
probable
that
they
would
not
have
liked
their
position
and
would
have
felt
that
it
might
spoil
their
pleasure
but
they
were
sympathetic
children
and
they
had
been
lonely
and
sad
enough
themselves
to
be
moved
by
a
sadness
in
others
even
if
it
was
an
uncomprehended
one
as
she
walked
by
the
man
s
side
still
letting
her
hand
remain
in
his
meg
kept
giving
him
scrutinizing
looks
aside
and
trying
in
her
way
to
read
him
he
was
a
man
just
past
middle
life
he
was
powerful
and
and
had
keen
and
at
the
same
time
rather
blue
eyes
with
brows
and
lashes
as
black
as
rob
s
and
her
own
there
was
something
strong
in
his
face
and
the
hand
which
held
hers
had
a
good
firm
grasp
and
felt
like
a
hand
which
had
worked
in
its
time
as
for
the
man
himself
he
was
trying
an
experiment
he
had
been
suddenly
seized
with
a
desire
to
try
it
and
see
how
it
would
result
he
was
not
sure
that
it
would
be
a
success
but
if
it
proved
one
it
might
help
to
rid
him
of
gloom
he
would
be
glad
to
be
relieved
of
he
felt
it
rather
promising
when
meg
went
at
once
to
the
point
and
asked
him
a
practical
question
you
don
t
know
our
names
she
said
you
don
t
know
mine
he
answered
it
s
john
holt
you
can
call
me
john
holt
said
meg
mr
john
the
man
laughed
her
grave
practical
little
air
pleased
him
say
john
holt
without
the
handle
to
it
he
said
it
sounds
meg
looked
at
him
inquiringly
though
he
had
laughed
he
seemed
to
mean
what
he
said
it
s
queer
of
course
she
said
because
we
don
t
know
each
other
well
but
i
can
do
it
if
you
i
do
like
he
said
and
he
laughed
again
very
well
said
meg
my
name
s
margaret
macleod
i
m
called
meg
for
short
my
brother
s
name
is
robin
and
ben
s
is
ben
nowell
where
shall
we
go
first
you
are
the
leader
of
the
party
he
answered
his
face
beginning
to
brighten
a
little
where
shall
it
be
the
palace
of
the
genius
of
the
flowers
she
said
is
that
what
it
is
called
he
asked
that
s
what
we
call
it
she
explained
that
s
part
of
the
fairy
story
are
part
of
a
fairy
story
and
all
these
are
palaces
that
the
genii
built
for
the
great
that
s
he
said
just
tell
us
about
it
ben
and
i
have
not
at
first
she
had
wondered
if
she
could
tell
her
stories
to
a
person
but
there
was
something
in
his
voice
and
face
that
gave
her
the
feeling
that
she
could
she
laughed
a
little
when
she
began
but
he
listened
with
enjoyment
that
was
so
plain
and
ben
walking
by
her
side
looked
up
with
such
eager
enraptured
and
wondering
eyes
that
she
went
on
bravely
it
grew
as
stories
will
in
being
told
and
it
was
better
than
it
had
been
the
day
before
robin
himself
saw
that
and
leaned
towards
her
as
eagerly
as
ben
by
the
time
they
entered
the
palace
of
the
flowers
and
stood
among
the
flame
of
colors
and
beneath
the
great
palm
fronds
swaying
under
the
crystal
globe
that
was
its
dome
she
had
warmed
until
she
was
all
aglow
and
as
full
of
fancies
as
the
pavilions
were
of
blossoms
as
she
dived
into
the
story
of
the
genius
who
strode
through
tropical
forests
and
deep
jungles
over
purple
moors
and
up
mountain
sides
where
pale
or
vivid
things
grew
in
tangles
or
stood
in
the
sun
alone
john
holt
became
of
the
opinion
that
his
experiment
would
be
a
success
it
was
here
that
he
began
to
find
he
had
gifts
to
give
she
asked
him
questions
robin
and
ben
asked
him
questions
the
three
drew
close
to
him
and
hung
on
his
every
word
you
know
the
things
and
the
places
where
they
grow
meg
said
we
have
never
seen
anything
we
can
only
try
to
imagine
you
can
tell
and
he
did
tell
them
and
as
they
went
from
court
to
pavilion
surrounded
by
sumptuous
bloom
and
sumptuous
leafage
and
sumptuous
fragrance
the
three
beginning
to
cling
to
him
to
turn
to
him
with
every
new
discovery
and
to
forget
he
was
a
stranger
he
knew
that
he
was
less
gloomy
than
he
had
been
before
and
that
somehow
this
thing
seemed
worth
doing
and
in
this
way
they
went
from
place
to
place
as
they
had
seen
beauties
and
wonders
the
day
before
they
saw
wonders
and
beauties
but
their
pleasure
had
a
flavor
new
to
them
for
the
first
time
in
years
since
they
had
left
their
little
seat
at
their
own
fireside
they
were
not
alone
and
some
one
seemed
to
mean
to
look
after
them
john
holt
was
an
eminently
practical
person
and
when
they
left
the
palace
of
the
flowers
they
began
vaguely
to
realize
that
stranger
or
not
he
had
taken
charge
of
them
it
was
evident
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
charge
of
people
and
things
he
took
charge
of
the
satchel
it
appeared
that
he
knew
where
it
was
safe
to
leave
it
can
we
get
it
at
lunch
time
robin
asked
with
some
anxiety
you
can
get
it
when
you
want
it
said
john
holt
a
little
later
he
looked
at
ben
s
pale
small
face
scrutinizingly
look
here
he
said
you
re
and
without
any
further
question
he
called
up
a
get
into
that
he
said
me
said
ben
a
little
alarmed
and
almost
a
shade
paler
at
the
thought
of
such
grandeur
ben
got
in
and
fell
back
with
a
luxurious
sigh
and
at
midday
when
they
were
beginning
to
feel
ravenous
though
no
one
mentioned
the
subject
he
asked
meg
a
blunt
question
where
did
you
eat
your
lunch
yesterday
he
asked
meg
flushed
a
little
feeling
that
hospitality
demanded
that
they
should
share
the
remaining
eggs
with
such
a
companion
and
she
was
afraid
there
would
be
very
few
to
offer
when
ben
was
taken
into
consideration
we
went
to
a
quiet
place
on
the
wooded
island
she
said
and
ate
it
with
the
roses
we
pretended
they
invited
us
we
had
only
eggs
and
a
sandwich
each
but
a
kind
woman
gave
us
something
of
her
we
brought
the
eggs
from
home
explained
rob
we
have
some
chickens
of
our
own
who
laid
them
we
thought
that
would
be
cheaper
than
buying
oh
said
john
holt
so
you
ve
been
living
on
eggs
got
any
left
a
few
meg
answered
they
re
in
the
satchel
we
shall
have
to
go
and
get
come
along
then
said
john
holt
pretty
hungry
by
this
time
aren
t
you
yes
said
meg
with
heartfelt
frankness
we
are
it
was
astonishing
how
much
john
holt
had
found
out
about
them
during
this
one
morning
they
did
not
know
themselves
how
much
their
answers
to
his
occasional
questions
had
told
him
he
had
not
known
himself
when
he
asked
the
questions
how
much
their
straightforward
practical
replies
would
reveal
they
had
not
sentimentalized
over
their
friendless
loneliness
but
he
had
found
himself
realizing
what
desolate
unnoticed
and
things
their
lives
were
they
had
not
told
him
how
they
had
tired
their
young
bodies
with
work
too
heavy
for
them
but
he
had
realized
it
in
his
mind
there
had
risen
a
picture
of
the
straw
parlor
under
the
roof
of
the
barn
with
these
two
huddled
together
in
the
cold
buried
in
the
straw
while
they
talked
over
their
desperate
plans
they
had
never
thought
of
calling
themselves
strong
and
determined
and
clear
of
wit
but
he
knew
how
strong
and
firm
of
purpose
and
endurance
two
creatures
so
young
and
unfriended
and
so
poor
must
have
been
to
form
a
plan
so
bold
and
carry
it
out
in
the
face
of
the
obstacles
of
youth
and
inexperience
and
empty
pockets
and
hands
he
had
laughed
at
the
story
of
the
treasure
saved
in
pennies
and
hidden
deep
in
the
straw
but
as
he
had
laughed
he
had
thought
with
a
quick
soft
throb
of
his
heart
that
the
woman
he
had
loved
and
lost
would
have
laughed
with
him
with
tears
in
the
eyes
which
meg
s
reminded
him
of
he
somehow
felt
as
if
she
might
be
wandering
about
with
them
in
their
city
beautiful
this
morning
they
were
so
entirely
creatures
she
would
have
been
drawn
to
and
longed
to
make
happier
he
liked
their
fancy
of
making
their
poor
little
feast
within
scent
of
the
roses
it
was
just
such
a
fancy
as
she
might
have
had
herself
and
he
wanted
to
see
what
they
had
to
depend
on
he
knew
it
must
be
little
and
it
touched
him
to
know
that
little
as
they
had
they
meant
to
share
it
with
their
poorer
friend
they
went
for
the
satchel
and
when
they
did
so
they
began
to
calculate
as
to
what
they
could
add
to
its
contents
they
were
few
things
and
poor
ones
he
did
not
sit
down
but
stood
by
and
watched
them
for
a
moment
when
having
reached
their
sequestered
nook
they
began
to
spread
out
their
banquet
it
was
composed
of
the
remnant
eggs
some
bread
and
a
slice
of
cheese
it
looked
painfully
scant
and
meg
had
an
anxious
eye
is
that
all
asked
john
holt
abruptly
yes
said
meg
we
shall
have
to
make
it
my
lord
ejaculated
john
holt
suddenly
in
his
blunt
fashion
and
he
turned
round
and
walked
away
where
s
he
gone
exclaimed
ben
timidly
but
they
none
of
them
could
guess
nice
as
he
had
been
he
had
a
brusque
way
and
perhaps
he
meant
to
leave
them
but
by
the
time
they
had
divided
the
eggs
and
the
bread
and
cheese
and
had
fairly
begun
he
came
marching
back
he
had
a
basket
on
his
arm
and
two
bottles
stuck
out
of
one
coat
pocket
while
a
parcel
protruded
from
the
other
he
came
and
threw
himself
down
on
the
grass
beside
them
and
opened
the
basket
it
was
full
of
good
things
i
m
going
to
have
lunch
with
you
he
said
and
i
have
a
pretty
big
appetite
so
i
ve
brought
you
something
to
eat
you
can
t
tramp
about
on
that
sort
of
the
basket
they
had
seen
the
day
before
had
been
a
poor
thing
compared
to
this
the
contents
of
this
would
have
been
a
feast
for
much
more
fastidious
creatures
than
three
ravenous
children
there
were
chickens
and
sandwiches
and
fruit
the
bottles
held
lemonade
and
the
package
in
the
coat
pocket
was
a
box
of
candy
had
such
good
things
in
our
lives
meg
gasped
amazed
hadn
t
you
said
john
holt
with
a
kind
and
even
a
happy
grin
well
pitch
xvii
what
a
feast
it
a
feast
they
were
so
hungry
they
were
so
happy
they
were
so
rejoiced
and
john
holt
watched
them
as
if
he
had
never
enjoyed
himself
so
much
before
he
laughed
he
made
jokes
he
handed
out
good
things
he
poured
out
lemonade
let
s
drink
to
the
great
magician
he
said
filling
the
little
glasses
he
had
brought
and
he
made
them
drink
it
standing
as
a
toast
in
all
the
grounds
that
day
there
was
no
such
a
party
it
was
so
exhilarated
and
amazed
at
itself
little
ben
looked
and
ate
and
laughed
as
if
the
lemonade
had
gone
to
his
head
oh
my
he
said
if
mother
could
see
me
we
ll
bring
her
said
john
holt
are
faltered
meg
looking
at
him
with
wide
eyes
are
you
coming
again
yes
john
holt
answered
and
you
are
coming
with
me
and
we
ll
come
every
day
until
you
ve
seen
it
you
three
will
pilot
me
you
must
be
very
rich
john
holt
said
meg
she
had
found
out
that
it
was
his
whim
to
want
her
to
call
him
so
i
have
plenty
of
money
he
said
if
that
s
being
rich
oh
yes
i
ve
got
money
enough
i
ve
more
land
than
aunt
and
then
it
was
that
suddenly
robin
remembered
something
i
believe
he
said
that
i
ve
heard
aunt
matilda
speak
about
you
to
jones
i
seem
to
remember
your
name
you
have
the
biggest
farm
in
illinois
and
you
have
houses
and
houses
in
town
meg
don
t
you
he
got
married
and
everybody
talked
about
how
rich
he
was
and
meg
did
remember
she
looked
at
him
softly
and
thought
she
knew
why
he
had
seemed
gloomy
for
she
remembered
that
this
rich
and
envied
man
s
wife
had
had
a
little
child
and
died
suddenly
and
she
had
even
heard
once
that
it
had
almost
driven
him
mad
because
he
had
been
fond
of
her
are
one
she
said
yes
he
answered
i
m
the
one
who
got
and
the
cloud
fell
on
his
face
again
and
for
a
minute
or
so
rested
there
for
he
thought
this
thing
which
had
happened
to
him
was
cruel
and
hideous
and
he
had
never
ceased
to
rebel
against
it
bitterly
meg
drew
a
little
closer
to
him
but
she
said
no
more
about
what
she
knew
he
was
thinking
of
she
was
a
clever
little
thing
and
knew
this
was
not
the
time
and
after
they
had
eaten
of
the
good
things
until
hunger
seemed
a
thing
of
the
past
the
afternoon
began
as
a
fairy
story
indeed
little
by
little
they
began
to
realize
that
john
holt
was
their
good
and
powerful
giant
for
it
seemed
that
he
was
not
only
ready
to
do
everything
for
them
but
was
rich
enough
have
you
been
to
the
midway
plaisance
he
asked
them
he
felt
very
sure
however
that
they
had
not
or
that
if
they
had
with
that
scant
purse
they
had
not
seen
what
they
longed
to
see
no
we
haven
t
said
meg
we
thought
we
would
save
it
until
we
had
seen
so
many
other
things
that
we
should
not
mind
so
much
only
seeing
the
outsides
of
places
we
knew
we
should
have
to
make
up
stories
all
the
we
won
t
save
it
said
john
holt
we
ll
go
now
we
will
hobnob
with
bedouins
and
japanese
and
turks
and
shake
hands
with
amazons
and
indians
we
ll
ride
on
camels
and
go
to
the
chinese
theatre
come
and
to
this
arabian
nights
entertainment
he
took
them
all
they
felt
as
if
he
were
a
prince
and
oh
the
exciting
strangeness
of
it
to
be
in
such
a
place
and
amid
such
marvels
with
a
man
who
seemed
to
set
no
limit
to
the
resources
of
his
purse
they
never
had
been
even
near
a
person
who
spent
money
as
if
it
were
made
for
spending
and
the
good
things
of
life
were
made
to
be
bought
by
it
what
john
holt
spent
was
only
what
other
people
with
full
purses
spent
in
the
midway
plaisance
but
to
meg
and
robin
and
ben
it
seemed
that
he
poured
forth
money
in
torrents
they
looked
at
him
with
timorous
wonder
and
marvelling
gratitude
it
seemed
that
he
meant
them
to
see
everything
and
to
do
everything
they
rode
on
camels
down
a
street
in
cairo
they
talked
to
chiefs
of
the
desert
they
listened
to
strange
music
they
heard
strange
tongues
and
tasted
strange
confections
robin
and
ben
went
about
like
creatures
in
a
delightful
dream
every
few
minutes
during
the
first
hour
robin
would
sidle
close
to
meg
and
clutch
her
dress
or
her
hand
with
a
gasp
of
rapture
oh
meg
he
would
say
and
yesterday
we
were
so
poor
and
now
we
are
seeing
and
when
john
holt
heard
him
he
would
laugh
half
to
himself
a
laugh
with
a
touch
of
pleasant
exultation
in
it
and
no
gloom
at
all
he
had
found
something
to
distract
him
at
last
he
liked
to
watch
meg
s
face
as
they
went
from
one
weirdly
foreign
place
to
another
her
eyes
were
immense
with
delight
and
her
face
had
the
flush
of
an
indian
peach
once
she
stopped
suddenly
in
such
a
glow
of
strange
delight
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
other
brightness
than
the
shining
of
her
pleasure
fairy
stories
happen
she
said
you
have
made
one
it
was
a
fairy
story
just
think
how
like
a
fairy
king
you
are
and
what
you
are
giving
to
us
it
will
be
enough
to
make
stories
of
forever
he
laughed
again
she
found
out
in
time
that
he
often
laughed
that
short
when
he
was
moved
by
something
he
had
had
a
rough
sort
of
life
successful
as
it
had
been
and
it
was
not
easy
for
him
to
express
all
he
felt
that
s
all
right
he
said
that
s
just
as
it
should
be
but
you
are
giving
something
to
me
and
so
they
were
and
it
was
not
a
little
thing
their
afternoon
was
a
thing
of
which
they
could
never
have
dreamed
and
for
which
they
could
never
have
hoped
before
it
was
half
over
they
began
to
feel
that
not
only
john
holt
was
a
prince
but
that
by
some
magic
metamorphosis
they
had
become
princes
themselves
it
seemed
that
nothing
in
that
city
beautiful
was
to
be
closed
to
them
it
was
john
holt
s
habit
to
do
things
in
a
thorough
way
and
he
did
this
thing
in
a
manner
which
was
a
credit
to
his
wit
and
good
sense
ben
who
had
never
been
taken
care
of
in
his
life
was
taken
about
in
a
chair
and
looked
after
in
a
way
that
made
him
wonder
if
he
were
not
dreaming
and
if
he
should
not
be
wakened
presently
by
the
sound
of
his
father
s
drunken
voice
robin
found
himself
more
than
once
rubbing
his
forehead
in
a
puzzled
fashion
meg
felt
rather
as
if
she
had
become
a
princess
somehow
she
and
john
holt
seemed
to
have
known
each
other
a
long
time
he
seemed
to
like
to
keep
her
near
him
and
always
kept
his
eye
on
her
to
see
if
she
was
enjoying
herself
and
was
comfortable
or
tired
she
found
herself
being
wheeled
by
ben
when
john
holt
decided
it
was
time
for
her
to
rest
he
walked
by
her
and
talked
to
her
answering
all
her
questions
more
than
once
it
flashed
into
her
mind
that
it
would
be
very
awful
when
all
this
joy
was
over
and
they
parted
as
they
would
but
they
were
going
to
see
him
he
had
said
it
seemed
as
if
they
marched
from
one
climax
of
new
experience
to
another
you
re
going
to
dine
with
me
he
announced
you
ve
had
enough
eggs
and
we
ll
see
the
illuminations
he
took
them
to
what
seemed
to
them
a
for
creatures
of
another
world
it
was
so
brilliant
with
light
so
decorated
so
gorgeous
servants
moved
to
and
fro
electric
globes
gleamed
palms
and
flowers
added
to
the
splendor
of
color
and
brightness
john
holt
gave
them
an
excellent
dinner
they
thought
it
was
a
banquet
ben
kept
his
eyes
on
john
holt
s
face
at
every
felt
as
if
he
might
vanish
away
he
looked
as
if
he
had
done
this
every
day
of
his
life
he
called
the
waiters
as
if
he
knew
no
awe
of
any
human
being
and
the
waiters
flew
to
obey
him
in
the
evening
he
took
them
to
see
the
city
beautiful
as
it
looked
at
night
it
was
set
it
seemed
to
them
with
myriads
of
diamonds
all
alight
endless
chains
of
jewels
seemed
strung
and
wound
about
it
the
palace
of
the
flowers
held
up
a
great
crystal
of
light
glowing
against
the
dark
blue
of
the
sky
towers
and
domes
were
crowned
and
diademed
thousands
of
jewels
hung
among
the
masses
of
leaves
or
reflected
themselves
sparkling
in
the
darkness
of
the
lagoons
fountains
of
molten
jewels
sprung
up
and
flamed
and
changed
the
city
beautiful
stood
out
whiter
and
more
than
ever
in
the
pure
radiance
of
these
garlands
of
clearest
flame
when
first
they
came
out
upon
it
robin
involuntarily
pressed
close
to
meg
and
their
twin
hands
clasped
each
other
oh
meg
cried
robin
oh
robin
breathed
meg
and
she
turned
to
john
holt
and
caught
his
hand
too
oh
john
holt
she
said
john
holt
very
primitive
and
brief
exclamations
of
joy
but
somehow
human
beings
have
uttered
them
just
as
simply
in
all
great
moments
through
centuries
john
holt
knew
just
the
degree
of
rapturous
feeling
they
expressed
and
he
held
meg
s
hand
close
and
with
a
warm
grasp
they
saw
the
marvellous
fairy
spectacle
from
all
points
and
from
all
sides
led
by
john
holt
they
lost
no
view
and
no
beauty
they
feasted
full
of
all
the
delight
of
it
and
at
last
he
took
them
to
a
quiet
corner
where
through
the
trees
sparkled
lights
and
dancing
water
and
let
them
talk
it
out
the
day
had
been
such
an
incredible
one
with
its
succession
of
excitements
and
almost
unreal
pleasures
that
they
had
actually
forgotten
that
the
night
must
come
they
were
young
enough
for
that
indiscretion
and
when
they
sat
down
and
began
to
realize
how
tired
they
were
they
also
began
to
realize
a
number
of
other
things
a
little
silence
fell
upon
them
ben
s
head
began
to
droop
slightly
upon
his
shoulder
and
john
holt
s
quick
eye
saw
it
have
you
had
a
good
day
he
asked
rob
said
meg
when
we
sat
in
the
straw
parlor
and
talked
about
the
city
beautiful
and
the
people
who
would
come
to
we
thought
we
could
never
see
it
we
ever
dream
that
if
they
were
kings
and
have
such
a
day
never
answered
robin
never
we
didn
t
know
such
a
day
was
in
the
that
s
right
said
john
holt
i
m
glad
it
s
seemed
as
good
as
that
now
where
did
you
think
of
spending
the
night
meg
and
rob
looked
at
each
other
since
rob
had
suggested
to
her
in
the
morning
a
bold
thought
they
had
had
no
time
to
discuss
the
matter
but
now
each
one
remembered
the
bold
idea
rob
got
up
and
came
close
to
john
holt
this
morning
i
thought
of
something
he
said
and
once
again
this
afternoon
i
thought
of
it
i
don
t
know
whether
we
could
do
it
but
you
could
tell
us
do
you
is
such
a
big
place
and
there
are
so
many
corners
we
could
creep
into
and
it
s
such
a
fine
you
think
we
could
wait
until
all
the
people
are
gone
and
then
find
a
place
to
sleep
without
going
out
of
the
grounds
it
would
save
us
buying
the
tickets
in
the
morning
and
ben
could
stay
with
told
his
mother
that
perhaps
he
might
not
come
he
could
have
another
john
holt
laughed
his
short
laugh
were
you
thinking
of
doing
that
he
said
well
you
have
plenty
of
sand
do
you
think
we
could
do
it
asked
meg
would
they
find
us
and
drive
us
out
john
holt
laughed
again
great
cÃ¦sar
he
said
no
i
don
t
think
they
d
find
you
two
luck
would
be
with
you
but
i
know
a
plan
worth
two
of
that
i
m
going
to
take
you
all
three
to
my
a
hotel
said
meg
ben
lifted
his
sleepy
head
from
his
shoulder
yes
said
john
holt
i
can
make
them
find
corners
for
you
though
they
re
pretty
crowded
i
m
not
going
to
lose
sight
of
you
this
has
begun
to
be
meg
looked
at
him
with
large
and
solemn
eyes
well
she
said
it
s
a
fairy
story
and
it
s
getting
fairyer
and
fairyer
every
she
leaned
forward
with
her
heart
quite
throbbing
because
it
was
he
who
did
this
splendid
to
whom
all
things
seemed
actually
seemed
a
thing
to
be
accepted
as
if
a
magician
had
done
it
oh
how
good
you
are
to
us
she
said
how
good
and
how
good
and
what
is
the
use
of
saying
only
thank
you
i
should
not
be
surprised
with
a
touch
of
awe
if
you
took
us
to
a
hotel
built
of
how
heartily
john
holt
laughed
then
well
some
of
them
ought
to
be
by
the
time
this
thing
s
over
he
said
but
the
lights
will
soon
be
out
the
people
are
going
and
ben
s
nearly
dead
let
s
go
and
find
a
xviii
yes
they
went
home
in
a
carriage
john
holt
put
them
into
it
and
settled
back
into
it
himself
as
if
comfortable
cushions
were
only
what
belonged
to
tired
people
and
he
took
them
to
one
of
the
hotels
whose
fronts
they
had
trudged
wearily
by
the
night
before
and
they
had
a
good
supper
and
warm
baths
and
delicious
beds
and
meg
went
to
sleep
with
actual
tears
of
wonder
and
gratitude
on
her
lashes
and
they
all
three
slept
the
sleep
of
eden
and
dreamed
the
dreams
of
paradise
and
in
the
morning
they
had
breakfast
with
john
holt
in
the
hotel
and
a
breakfast
as
good
as
the
princely
dinner
he
had
given
them
and
after
it
they
all
went
back
with
him
to
the
city
beautiful
and
the
fairy
story
began
again
for
near
the
entrance
where
they
went
in
they
actually
found
ben
s
mother
in
a
state
of
wonder
beyond
words
for
by
the
use
of
some
magic
messenger
that
wonderful
john
holt
had
sent
word
to
her
that
ben
was
in
safe
hands
and
that
she
must
come
and
join
him
and
the
money
to
make
this
possible
had
been
in
the
letter
poor
tired
discouraged
woman
how
she
lost
her
breath
when
ben
threw
himself
upon
her
and
poured
forth
his
story
and
what
a
face
she
wore
through
all
that
followed
how
ben
led
her
from
triumph
to
triumph
with
the
exultant
air
of
one
to
whom
the
city
beautiful
almost
belonged
and
who
consequently
had
it
to
bestow
as
a
rich
gift
on
those
who
did
not
know
it
as
he
did
what
wondering
glances
his
mother
kept
casting
on
his
face
which
had
grown
younger
with
each
hour
she
had
never
seen
him
look
like
this
before
and
what
glances
she
cast
aside
at
john
holt
this
was
one
of
the
rich
men
poor
people
heard
of
she
had
never
been
near
one
of
them
she
had
often
rather
hated
them
before
the
day
was
over
robin
and
meg
realized
that
this
wonder
was
to
go
on
as
long
as
there
was
anything
of
the
city
beautiful
they
had
not
seen
they
were
to
drink
deep
draughts
of
delight
as
long
as
they
were
thirsty
for
more
john
holt
made
this
plain
to
them
in
his
blunt
humorous
way
he
was
going
to
show
them
everything
and
share
all
their
pleasures
and
they
were
to
stay
at
the
golden
hotel
every
night
and
john
holt
was
getting
almost
as
much
out
of
it
as
they
were
he
wandered
about
alone
no
more
he
did
not
feel
as
if
he
were
only
a
ghost
with
nothing
in
common
with
the
human
beings
passing
by
in
the
interest
and
excitement
of
generalship
and
management
and
the
amusement
of
seeing
this
unspoiled
freshness
of
his
charges
delight
in
all
things
the
gloomy
look
faded
out
of
his
face
and
he
looked
like
a
different
man
once
they
came
upon
two
men
who
seemed
to
know
him
and
the
first
one
who
spoke
to
him
glanced
at
the
children
in
some
surprise
hallo
john
he
said
set
up
a
family
just
what
i
ve
done
answered
john
holt
set
up
a
family
a
man
s
no
right
to
be
going
around
a
place
like
this
without
how
do
you
get
on
with
it
asked
the
other
find
it
pay
pay
said
john
holt
with
a
big
laugh
great
scott
i
should
say
so
it
s
worth
twice
the
price
of
admission
glad
of
it
said
his
friend
giving
him
a
curious
look
and
as
he
went
away
meg
heard
him
say
to
his
companion
it
was
time
he
found
something
that
holt
he
was
in
a
pretty
bad
bad
as
they
became
more
and
more
intimate
and
spoke
more
to
each
other
meg
understood
how
bad
a
way
he
had
been
in
she
was
an
observing
child
and
she
saw
many
things
a
less
sympathetic
creature
might
have
passed
by
and
when
john
holt
discovered
he
was
quite
shrewd
enough
to
do
rather
gradually
began
to
say
things
to
her
he
would
not
have
said
to
other
people
she
understood
somehow
that
though
the
black
look
passed
away
from
his
face
and
he
laughed
and
made
them
laugh
there
was
a
thing
that
was
never
quite
out
of
his
mind
she
saw
that
pictures
brought
it
back
to
him
that
strains
of
music
did
that
pretty
mothers
with
children
hurt
him
when
they
passed
and
that
every
now
and
then
he
would
cast
a
broad
glance
over
all
the
whiteness
and
blueness
and
beauty
and
grace
and
draw
a
long
quick
if
he
were
homesick
for
something
you
know
he
said
once
when
he
did
this
and
looked
round
and
found
meg
s
eyes
resting
yearningly
upon
him
you
know
she
was
coming
with
me
we
planned
it
all
lord
how
she
liked
to
talk
of
it
she
said
it
would
be
an
enchanted
as
you
did
meg
that
was
one
of
the
first
things
that
made
me
stop
to
i
heard
you
say
that
an
enchanted
city
he
repeated
pondering
lord
lord
well
said
meg
with
a
little
catch
in
her
breath
well
you
know
john
holt
she
s
got
to
an
enchanted
city
that
won
t
vanish
away
hasn
t
she
she
did
not
say
it
with
any
sanctified
little
air
out
of
their
own
loneliness
and
the
pilgrim
s
progress
and
her
ardent
fancies
the
place
she
and
robin
had
built
to
take
refuge
in
was
a
very
real
thing
it
had
many
modern
improvements
upon
the
vagueness
of
harps
and
crowns
there
were
good
souls
who
might
have
been
astounded
and
rather
shocked
by
it
but
the
children
believed
in
it
very
implicitly
and
found
great
comfort
in
their
confidence
in
its
joyfulness
they
thought
of
themselves
as
walking
about
its
streets
exactly
as
rapturously
as
they
walked
about
this
earthly
city
beautiful
and
because
it
was
so
real
there
was
a
note
in
meg
s
voice
which
gave
john
holt
a
sudden
touch
of
new
feeling
as
he
looked
back
at
her
do
you
suppose
she
is
he
said
you
believe
in
that
don
t
believe
in
it
meg
looked
a
little
troubled
for
a
moment
why
she
said
rob
and
i
talk
to
each
other
and
invent
things
about
it
just
as
we
talked
about
this
we
just
to
you
see
perhaps
we
say
things
that
would
seem
very
funny
to
religious
don
t
think
we
re
religious
we
do
do
you
said
john
holt
perhaps
i
should
too
you
shall
tell
me
some
stories
about
it
and
you
shall
put
her
there
if
i
could
feel
as
if
she
were
somewhere
oh
said
meg
she
must
be
somewhere
you
know
she
couldn
t
john
he
cast
his
broad
glance
all
around
and
caught
his
breath
as
if
remembering
lord
lord
he
said
no
couldn
t
go
out
meg
knew
afterwards
why
he
said
this
with
such
force
she
had
been
a
creature
who
was
so
full
of
life
and
of
the
joy
of
living
she
had
been
gay
and
full
of
laughter
and
humor
she
had
had
a
wonderful
vivid
mind
which
found
color
and
feeling
and
story
in
the
commonest
things
she
had
been
so
clever
and
so
witty
and
such
a
bright
and
warm
thing
in
her
house
when
she
had
gone
away
from
earth
so
suddenly
people
had
said
with
wonder
but
it
seemed
as
if
she
not
die
but
she
had
died
and
her
child
had
died
too
scarcely
an
hour
after
it
was
born
and
john
holt
had
been
left
stunned
and
aghast
and
almost
stricken
into
gloomy
madness
and
in
some
way
meg
was
like
her
with
her
vivid
little
face
and
her
eyes
her
city
beautiful
and
her
dreams
and
stories
which
made
the
realities
of
her
life
it
was
a
strange
chance
a
marvellously
kind
chance
which
had
thrown
them
together
these
two
who
were
of
such
different
worlds
and
yet
who
needed
each
other
so
much
during
the
afternoon
seeing
that
meg
looked
a
little
tired
and
also
realizing
in
his
practical
fashion
that
ben
s
mother
would
be
more
at
ease
in
the
society
she
was
used
to
john
holt
sent
her
to
ramble
about
with
her
boy
and
robin
went
with
them
and
meg
and
john
went
to
rest
with
the
thousands
of
roses
among
the
bowers
of
the
fairy
island
and
there
they
said
a
good
deal
to
each
other
john
holt
seemed
to
get
a
kind
of
comfort
in
finding
words
for
some
of
the
thoughts
he
had
been
silent
about
in
the
past
it
s
a
queer
thing
he
said
but
when
i
talk
to
you
about
her
i
feel
as
if
she
were
somewhere
perhaps
she
is
said
meg
in
her
little
way
we
don
t
know
what
they
are
doing
but
if
you
had
gone
into
another
world
and
she
had
stayed
here
you
know
you
would
have
come
to
take
care
of
that
s
true
said
john
holt
i
took
care
of
her
when
she
was
here
the
lord
knows
there
wasn
t
anything
on
earth
she
liked
that
i
wouldn
t
have
broken
my
neck
to
get
at
when
i
built
that
house
for
built
a
big
house
to
take
her
to
when
we
were
said
i
hadn
t
left
out
a
thing
she
cared
for
and
she
what
things
ought
to
be
she
wasn
t
like
me
meg
i
d
spent
my
life
trying
to
make
a
fortune
i
began
when
i
was
a
boy
and
i
worked
hard
she
belonged
to
people
with
money
and
she
d
read
books
and
travelled
and
seen
things
she
knew
it
all
i
didn
t
when
first
i
knew
her
but
i
learned
fast
enough
afterwards
i
couldn
t
help
it
while
i
was
with
her
we
planned
the
house
together
it
was
one
of
the
best
in
the
furniture
pictures
and
all
the
rest
the
first
evening
we
spent
he
stopped
and
cleared
his
throat
and
was
silent
a
few
seconds
then
he
added
in
a
rather
unsteady
voice
we
were
pretty
happy
people
that
later
he
showed
meg
her
miniature
he
carried
it
in
an
oval
case
in
his
inside
pocket
it
was
the
picture
of
a
young
woman
with
a
brilliant
face
lovely
laughing
eyes
and
a
bright
curving
red
mouth
no
he
said
as
he
looked
at
it
she
go
out
she
s
then
he
told
meg
about
the
rooms
they
had
made
ready
for
john
holt
junior
as
they
had
called
the
little
child
who
died
so
quickly
it
was
her
idea
he
said
there
was
a
nursery
with
picture
paper
on
the
walls
there
was
a
bathroom
with
tiles
that
told
stories
about
little
mermen
and
mermaids
that
she
had
made
up
herself
there
was
a
bedroom
with
a
swinging
cot
frilled
with
lace
and
tied
with
ribbons
and
there
were
and
toys
the
doors
never
were
opened
john
holt
junior
never
slept
in
his
cot
he
slept
with
his
there
he
broke
off
a
moment
again
she
used
to
be
sorry
he
wouldn
t
be
old
enough
to
appreciate
all
this
he
said
next
she
used
to
laugh
about
him
and
say
he
was
going
to
be
cheated
out
of
it
but
she
said
he
should
come
with
us
so
that
he
could
say
he
had
been
she
said
he
had
to
see
it
if
he
only
stared
at
it
and
said
perhaps
he
does
see
it
said
meg
i
should
think
those
who
have
got
away
from
here
and
know
more
what
being
alive
really
means
would
want
to
see
what
earth
people
are
to
they
know
so
that
sounds
pretty
good
said
john
holt
i
like
they
had
been
seated
long
enough
to
feel
rested
and
they
rose
and
went
on
their
way
to
begin
their
pilgrimage
again
just
as
they
were
crossing
the
bridge
they
saw
robin
coming
tearing
towards
them
he
evidently
had
left
ben
and
his
mother
somewhere
he
was
alone
his
hat
was
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
he
was
hot
with
running
something
has
happened
said
meg
and
i
believe
i
but
robin
had
reached
them
meg
he
said
panting
for
breath
aunt
matilda
s
here
she
didn
t
see
me
but
i
saw
her
she
s
in
the
agricultural
building
standing
before
a
new
steam
plough
and
she
s
chewing
a
sample
of
xix
the
two
children
did
not
know
exactly
whether
they
were
frightened
or
not
if
it
had
not
seemed
impossible
that
anything
should
go
entirely
wrong
while
john
holt
was
near
them
they
would
have
felt
rather
queer
but
john
holt
was
evidently
not
the
least
alarmed
look
here
he
said
i
m
glad
of
it
i
want
to
see
that
do
you
exclaimed
robin
and
meg
together
yes
i
do
he
said
come
along
and
let
s
go
and
find
and
he
strode
out
towards
the
agricultural
building
as
if
he
were
going
towards
something
interesting
it
is
true
that
the
agricultural
building
had
been
too
nearly
connected
with
aunt
matilda
s
world
to
hold
the
greatest
attractions
for
the
little
pilgrims
it
had
indeed
gone
rather
hard
with
them
to
find
a
name
for
it
with
a
beautiful
sound
but
it
something
meg
had
said
and
it
s
a
great
huge
thing
whether
we
care
for
it
or
not
that
it
isn
t
the
thing
we
care
for
doesn
t
make
it
any
less
we
should
be
fools
if
we
thought
that
of
course
and
you
know
we
re
not
fools
no
rob
had
said
standing
gazing
at
rakes
and
harrows
with
his
brows
knit
and
his
legs
pretty
wide
apart
and
if
there
s
one
thing
that
shows
human
beings
do
what
they
set
their
minds
to
it
s
this
place
why
they
used
to
thresh
wheat
with
pieces
of
wood
hooked
together
they
banged
the
wheat
on
the
barn
floor
with
things
like
that
i
ll
tell
you
what
as
soon
as
a
man
gets
any
sense
he
begins
to
make
machines
he
bangs
at
things
with
his
brain
instead
of
with
his
arms
and
and
in
the
end
they
had
called
it
the
palace
of
the
genius
of
the
garth
and
the
seasons
and
the
sun
they
walked
manfully
by
john
holt
through
the
place
robin
leading
the
way
until
they
came
to
the
particular
exhibit
where
he
had
caught
sight
of
aunt
matilda
being
a
and
thorough
person
she
was
still
there
though
she
had
left
the
steam
plough
and
directed
her
attention
to
a
hay
rake
which
she
seemed
to
find
very
well
worth
study
if
the
children
and
john
holt
had
not
walked
up
and
planted
themselves
immediately
in
her
path
she
would
not
have
seen
them
it
gave
meg
a
little
shudder
to
see
how
like
her
world
she
looked
with
her
hard
face
her
straight
skirt
and
her
square
shoulders
they
waited
until
she
moved
and
then
she
looked
up
and
saw
them
she
did
not
start
or
look
nervous
in
the
least
she
stared
at
them
well
she
said
so
this
was
the
place
you
came
yes
aunt
matilda
said
robin
we
couldn
t
let
it
go
by
we
took
our
own
and
we
knew
you
wouldn
t
be
anxious
about
us
said
meg
looking
up
at
her
with
a
shade
of
curiosity
aunt
matilda
gave
a
dry
laugh
no
she
said
i
ve
no
time
to
be
anxious
about
children
i
took
care
of
myself
when
i
was
your
age
and
i
had
a
sort
of
notion
you
d
come
here
who
are
you
with
john
holt
lifted
his
hat
but
without
too
much
ceremony
he
knew
matilda
jennings
s
principles
were
opposed
to
the
ceremonious
i
m
a
sort
of
neighbor
of
yours
jennings
he
explained
i
have
some
land
near
your
farm
though
i
don
t
live
on
the
place
my
name
is
john
aunt
matilda
glanced
from
him
to
robin
she
knew
all
about
john
holt
and
was
quite
sufficiently
to
realize
that
it
would
be
considered
good
luck
to
have
him
for
a
friend
well
she
said
to
them
you
ve
got
into
good
john
holt
laughed
by
this
time
we
all
three
think
we
ve
got
into
good
hands
he
said
and
we
re
going
to
see
this
thing
they
haven
t
money
enough
to
see
much
of
it
said
jennings
no
said
john
holt
but
i
have
and
it
s
to
be
my
well
said
aunt
matilda
i
suppose
you
can
afford
it
i
couldn
t
i
ve
come
here
on
you
d
better
let
us
help
you
to
combine
a
little
pleasure
with
it
said
john
holt
this
won
t
happen
twice
in
your
life
or
there
s
been
a
lot
of
money
wasted
in
decorations
said
jennings
i
don
t
believe
it
will
pay
oh
yes
it
will
pay
them
said
john
holt
it
would
pay
them
if
they
didn
t
make
a
cent
out
of
it
it
would
have
paid
if
i
d
done
it
and
lost
now
see
here
said
matilda
jennings
with
a
shrewd
air
the
people
that
built
this
didn
t
do
it
for
their
did
it
for
what
they
d
make
out
of
perhaps
they
did
said
john
holt
and
perhaps
all
of
them
didn
t
and
even
those
that
did
have
made
a
bigger
thing
than
they
knew
by
jupiter
they
were
all
sauntering
along
together
as
they
spoke
meg
and
robin
wondered
what
john
holt
was
going
to
do
it
looked
rather
as
if
he
wanted
to
see
more
of
aunt
matilda
and
it
proved
that
he
did
he
had
a
reason
of
his
own
and
combined
with
this
a
certain
keen
sense
of
humor
made
her
entertaining
to
him
he
wanted
to
see
how
the
place
affected
her
as
he
had
wanted
to
look
on
at
its
effect
on
meg
and
robin
but
he
knew
that
aunt
matilda
had
come
to
accumulate
new
ideas
on
agriculture
and
that
she
must
be
first
allowed
to
satisfy
herself
on
that
point
and
he
knew
the
children
were
not
specially
happy
in
the
society
of
ploughs
and
and
he
did
not
think
aunt
matilda
s
presence
would
add
to
their
pleasure
in
the
palace
of
the
earth
the
seasons
and
the
sun
besides
he
wanted
to
talk
to
jennings
a
little
alone
you
know
where
ben
and
his
mother
are
he
said
to
robin
after
a
few
minutes
yes
robin
answered
then
take
meg
and
go
to
them
for
a
while
jennings
wants
to
stay
here
about
an
hour
more
and
i
want
to
walk
round
with
her
in
an
hour
come
back
to
the
entrance
here
and
i
will
meet
meg
and
robin
went
away
as
he
told
them
it
was
in
one
sense
rather
a
relief
i
wonder
what
she
ll
say
to
him
said
meg
there
s
no
knowing
robin
answered
but
whatever
it
is
he
will
make
it
all
right
he
s
one
of
those
who
have
found
out
human
beings
can
do
things
if
they
try
hard
enough
he
was
as
lonely
and
poor
as
we
are
when
he
was
twelve
he
told
me
what
aunt
matilda
said
was
very
i
must
say
she
said
as
the
children
walked
off
you
seem
to
have
been
pretty
good
to
they
ve
been
pretty
good
to
me
said
john
holt
they
ve
been
pretty
good
me
though
they
re
not
old
enough
to
know
they
re
older
than
their
age
said
aunt
matilda
if
they
d
been
like
other
children
the
lord
knows
what
i
should
have
done
with
them
they
ve
been
no
trouble
in
i
should
imagine
not
said
john
holt
it
was
pretty
of
them
said
jennings
with
another
dry
laugh
to
make
up
their
minds
without
saying
a
word
to
any
one
and
just
hustle
around
and
make
their
money
to
come
here
they
both
worked
pretty
steady
i
can
tell
you
and
it
wasn
t
easy
work
either
most
young
ones
would
have
given
in
but
they
were
bound
to
get
they
ll
be
bound
to
get
pretty
much
where
they
make
up
their
minds
to
as
life
goes
on
remarked
john
holt
that
s
their
thank
goodness
they
re
not
like
their
father
jennings
commented
robert
hadn
t
any
particular
fault
but
he
never
made
he
and
his
wife
seem
to
have
made
a
home
that
was
a
pretty
good
start
for
these
children
was
what
john
holt
said
well
said
jennings
they
ve
got
to
do
the
rest
themselves
he
left
them
no
other
relations
but
you
john
holt
asked
not
a
soul
i
shall
keep
them
and
let
them
work
on
the
farm
i
it
would
pay
to
educate
them
well
and
let
them
see
the
world
said
john
holt
i
dare
say
it
would
pay
replied
aunt
matilda
but
i
ve
got
all
i
can
do
and
my
husband
s
family
have
a
sort
of
claim
on
me
half
the
farm
belonged
to
they
spent
their
remaining
hours
in
the
agricultural
building
very
profitably
jennings
found
john
holt
an
excellent
companion
he
knew
things
very
thoroughly
and
had
ideas
of
how
far
things
would
work
and
how
much
they
would
pay
he
did
not
expect
jennings
to
tell
him
fairy
stories
and
he
told
her
none
but
before
they
left
the
place
they
had
talked
a
good
deal
john
holt
had
found
out
all
he
wanted
to
know
about
the
two
children
and
he
had
made
a
proposition
which
certainly
gave
aunt
matilda
something
new
to
think
of
she
was
giving
some
thought
to
it
when
they
went
out
to
meet
the
party
of
four
at
the
entrance
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
rather
surprised
by
some
occurrence
but
she
did
not
look
displeased
and
the
glances
she
gave
to
meg
and
robin
expressed
a
new
sense
of
appreciation
of
their
practical
value
i
ve
promised
holt
that
i
ll
let
him
take
me
through
the
midway
plaisance
she
said
i
ve
seen
the
things
i
came
to
see
and
i
may
as
well
get
my
ticket
s
meg
and
robin
regarded
her
with
interest
aunt
matilda
and
the
midway
plaisance
taken
together
would
be
such
a
startling
contrast
that
they
must
be
interesting
and
as
she
looked
at
john
holt
s
face
as
they
went
on
their
way
meg
knew
he
was
thinking
the
same
thing
and
it
was
a
strange
experience
jennings
strode
through
the
curious
places
rather
as
if
she
were
following
a
plough
down
a
furrow
she
looked
at
samoan
beauties
arab
chiefs
and
persian
jersey
lilies
with
unmovedly
scrutinizing
eyes
she
did
not
waste
time
anywhere
but
she
took
all
in
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
business
camel
drivers
and
donkey
boys
seemed
to
strike
her
merely
as
samples
of
slow
travelling
she
ascended
as
it
were
into
on
the
ferris
wheel
with
a
grim
air
of
determination
being
so
lifted
from
earth
and
poised
above
in
the
clear
air
meg
had
thrilled
with
a
strange
exultant
feeling
of
being
a
bird
and
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
with
a
moment
s
flutter
of
wings
she
could
soar
higher
and
higher
and
lose
herself
in
the
pure
sea
of
blue
above
aunt
matilda
looked
down
with
cool
interest
pretty
big
power
this
she
said
to
john
holt
i
guess
it
s
made
one
man
s
john
holt
was
a
generous
host
he
took
her
from
place
to
lapland
villages
cannibal
huts
and
moorish
palaces
she
tramped
about
and
inspected
them
all
with
a
sharp
unenthusiastic
eye
she
looked
at
the
men
and
women
and
their
strange
costumes
plainly
thinking
them
rather
mad
it
s
a
queer
sight
she
said
to
john
holt
but
i
don
t
see
what
good
all
this
is
going
to
do
any
it
saves
travelling
expenses
answered
john
holt
laughing
his
shrewd
humorous
face
was
very
full
of
expression
all
the
time
they
were
walking
about
together
she
had
only
come
for
the
day
and
she
was
going
back
by
a
night
train
when
she
left
them
she
gave
them
both
one
of
those
newly
appreciative
looks
well
she
said
mr
holt
s
going
to
look
after
you
he
says
he
s
got
something
to
tell
you
when
i
m
gone
we
ve
talked
it
over
and
it
s
all
right
there
s
one
thing
sure
you
re
two
of
the
luckiest
young
ones
ve
heard
and
she
marched
away
briskly
meg
and
robin
looked
at
each
other
and
at
john
holt
what
was
he
going
to
tell
them
but
he
told
them
nothing
until
they
had
all
dined
and
ben
and
his
mother
had
gone
home
prepared
to
come
again
the
next
day
by
that
time
the
city
beautiful
was
wreathed
with
its
enchanted
jewels
of
light
again
and
in
the
lagoon
s
depths
they
trembled
and
blazed
john
holt
called
a
gondola
with
a
brilliant
gondolier
and
they
got
into
it
and
shot
out
into
the
radiant
night
the
sight
was
so
unearthly
in
its
beauty
that
for
a
few
moments
they
were
quite
still
meg
sat
in
her
straw
parlor
attitude
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
chin
on
her
hands
her
eyes
looked
very
big
and
as
lustrous
as
the
jewels
in
the
lagoon
i
m
going
to
ask
you
something
said
john
holt
in
a
quiet
sort
of
voice
at
last
yes
said
meg
dreamily
would
you
two
like
to
belong
to
meg
s
hands
dropped
and
she
turned
her
shining
eyes
i
ve
been
talking
to
your
aunt
matilda
about
that
big
house
of
mine
he
went
on
it
s
empty
there
s
too
much
room
in
it
i
want
to
take
you
two
and
see
if
you
can
fill
it
up
will
you
come
illustration
it
s
a
queer
sight
she
said
to
john
holt
meg
and
robin
turned
their
eyes
upon
each
other
in
a
dazed
way
will
we
come
they
stammered
mrs
jennings
is
willing
said
john
holt
you
two
have
things
to
do
in
the
world
i
ll
help
you
to
learn
to
do
them
you
with
the
short
you
shall
tell
me
fairy
fairy
stories
what
was
this
their
hearts
beat
in
their
breasts
like
little
hammers
the
gondola
moved
smoothly
over
the
scintillating
water
and
the
towers
and
domes
rose
white
against
the
lovely
night
meg
looked
around
her
and
uttered
a
little
cry
oh
rob
she
said
oh
dear
john
holt
we
have
got
the
city
beautiful
and
you
are
going
to
let
us
live
there
and
john
holt
knew
that
the
big
house
would
seem
empty
no
more
xx
it
would
have
seemed
that
this
was
the
climax
of
wonders
and
know
that
they
had
escaped
forever
from
aunt
matilda
s
world
that
they
were
not
to
be
parted
from
john
holt
that
they
were
to
be
like
his
children
living
with
him
sharing
his
great
house
and
learning
all
they
could
want
to
learn
all
this
even
when
it
was
spoken
of
as
possible
seemed
more
than
could
be
believed
but
it
seemed
almost
more
unbelievable
day
by
day
as
the
truth
began
to
realize
itself
in
detail
what
a
marvellous
thing
it
was
to
find
out
that
they
were
not
lonely
creatures
any
more
but
that
they
belonged
to
a
man
who
seemed
to
hold
all
power
in
his
hands
when
john
holt
took
them
to
the
big
stores
and
bought
them
all
they
needed
new
clothes
and
new
trunks
and
new
comforts
and
luxuries
such
as
they
had
never
thought
of
as
belonging
to
them
they
felt
almost
aghast
he
was
so
practical
and
seemed
to
know
so
well
how
to
do
everything
that
each
hour
convinced
them
more
and
more
that
everything
was
possible
to
him
and
he
seemed
to
like
so
much
to
be
with
them
day
after
day
he
took
them
to
their
city
beautiful
and
enjoyed
with
them
every
treasure
in
it
and
they
had
so
much
time
before
them
they
could
see
it
all
at
rapturous
leisure
and
ease
no
more
hungry
hours
no
more
straining
of
tired
bodies
and
spurring
of
weary
feet
because
there
was
so
much
to
see
and
so
little
time
to
see
it
in
because
there
was
so
little
money
to
be
spent
there
was
time
to
loiter
through
palaces
and
linger
before
pictures
and
marvellous
things
and
john
holt
could
explain
them
all
no
more
limited
and
vague
imaginings
there
was
time
to
hear
everything
and
meg
could
tell
fairy
stories
by
the
hour
if
she
was
in
the
mood
she
told
them
in
tropical
bowers
she
told
them
as
they
floated
on
the
lagoon
she
read
them
in
strange
savage
or
oriental
faces
i
shall
have
enough
to
last
all
my
life
john
holt
she
would
say
i
see
a
new
one
every
if
you
like
i
will
tell
them
all
to
you
and
robin
when
you
have
nothing
else
to
it
will
be
like
the
arabian
nights
said
robin
meg
do
you
remember
that
old
book
we
had
where
all
the
leaves
we
wanted
most
were
torn
out
and
we
had
to
make
the
rest
up
ourselves
there
was
one
story
meg
found
john
holt
liked
better
than
all
the
rest
it
was
the
one
about
the
city
beautiful
into
which
she
used
to
follow
christian
in
the
days
when
she
and
robin
lay
in
the
straw
parlor
it
had
grown
so
real
to
her
that
she
made
it
very
real
and
near
in
the
telling
john
holt
liked
the
way
she
had
of
filling
it
with
people
and
things
she
knew
quite
well
meg
was
very
simple
about
it
all
but
she
told
that
story
well
and
often
when
they
were
resting
in
some
beautiful
place
alone
john
holt
would
lead
her
back
to
it
and
sit
beside
her
listening
with
a
singular
expression
in
his
eyes
ah
those
were
wonderful
days
ben
and
his
mother
shared
them
though
they
were
not
always
with
john
holt
and
robin
and
meg
john
holt
made
comfortable
plans
for
them
and
let
them
wander
about
and
look
their
fill
it
s
a
great
thing
for
holt
said
the
poor
woman
once
with
a
side
glance
at
ben
seems
like
he
s
been
born
over
again
the
way
he
talks
when
we
go
home
at
night
is
as
if
he
d
never
be
tired
again
as
long
as
he
lives
and
a
month
ago
i
used
to
think
he
d
wear
himself
out
fretting
seemed
like
i
could
see
him
getting
thinner
and
peakeder
every
day
my
it
s
a
wonderful
thing
and
john
holt
s
kindness
did
not
end
there
though
it
was
some
time
before
meg
and
robin
heard
all
he
had
done
one
day
when
they
had
left
the
grounds
earlier
than
usual
because
they
were
tired
he
spent
the
evening
in
searching
out
ben
s
disreputable
father
and
giving
him
what
he
called
a
straight
look
here
he
said
i
m
going
to
keep
my
eye
on
that
boy
of
yours
and
your
wife
i
intend
to
make
the
house
decent
and
see
that
the
boy
has
a
chance
to
learn
something
and
take
care
they
re
not
too
hard
run
but
i
m
going
to
keep
my
eye
on
you
least
i
shall
see
that
some
one
else
if
you
make
things
uncomfortable
you
ll
be
made
pretty
uncomfortable
yourself
that
s
all
i
d
advise
you
to
try
the
new
recreation
of
going
to
work
it
ll
be
good
for
your
health
sort
of
and
he
kept
his
word
it
was
a
marvel
of
a
holiday
it
is
not
possible
that
among
all
the
there
were
two
others
who
were
nearer
the
rapture
of
paradise
than
these
two
little
pilgrims
when
it
was
at
an
end
they
went
home
with
john
holt
it
was
a
wonderful
the
house
was
a
wonderful
house
it
was
one
of
the
remarkable
places
that
some
western
men
have
built
and
furnished
with
the
aid
of
unlimited
fortunes
and
the
unlimited
shrewd
good
sense
which
has
taught
most
of
those
of
them
whose
lives
have
been
spent
in
work
and
bold
ventures
that
it
is
more
practical
to
buy
taste
and
experience
than
to
spend
money
without
it
john
holt
had
also
had
the
aid
and
taste
of
a
wonderful
little
woman
whose
life
had
been
easier
and
whose
world
had
been
broader
than
his
own
together
they
had
built
a
beautiful
and
lovable
home
to
live
in
it
contained
things
from
many
countries
and
its
charm
and
luxury
might
well
have
been
the
result
of
a
far
older
civilization
don
t
you
think
robin
said
meg
in
a
low
voice
the
first
evening
as
they
sat
in
a
in
the
library
together
don
t
you
think
you
know
what
she
was
like
they
had
spoken
together
of
her
often
and
somehow
it
was
always
in
a
rather
low
voice
and
they
always
called
her
robin
looked
up
from
the
book
he
held
on
his
knee
it
was
a
beautiful
volume
she
had
been
fond
of
i
know
why
you
say
that
he
said
you
mean
that
somehow
the
house
is
like
her
yes
i
m
sure
it
is
just
as
aunt
matilda
s
house
is
like
her
people
s
houses
are
always
like
this
one
is
full
of
her
said
meg
i
should
think
john
holt
would
feel
as
if
she
must
be
in
it
and
she
might
speak
to
him
any
moment
i
feel
as
if
she
might
speak
to
me
and
it
isn
t
only
the
pictures
of
her
everywhere
with
her
eyes
laughing
at
you
from
the
wall
and
the
tables
and
the
mantels
it
s
perhaps
it
is
because
she
helped
john
holt
to
choose
things
and
was
so
happy
perhaps
it
is
said
robin
and
he
added
softly
this
was
her
they
went
once
more
to
aunt
matilda
s
world
they
did
it
because
john
holt
wanted
to
see
the
straw
parlor
and
they
wanted
to
show
it
to
him
and
bid
it
aunt
matilda
treated
them
with
curious
consideration
it
almost
seemed
as
if
she
had
begun
to
regard
them
with
respect
it
seemed
to
her
that
any
person
would
respect
two
penniless
children
who
had
made
themselves
attractive
to
a
man
with
the
biggest
farm
in
illinois
and
other
resources
still
larger
they
went
out
to
the
barn
in
their
old
way
when
no
one
knew
where
they
were
going
and
when
no
one
was
about
to
see
them
place
their
ladder
against
the
stack
and
climb
up
to
the
top
the
roof
seemed
more
like
a
dark
tent
than
ever
and
they
saw
the
old
birds
nests
which
by
this
time
were
empty
meg
said
robin
do
you
remember
the
day
we
lay
in
the
straw
and
told
each
other
we
had
got
work
and
do
you
remember
the
afternoon
i
climbed
up
with
the
old
to
boil
the
eggs
in
and
when
we
counted
the
treasure
said
meg
and
when
we
talked
about
miracles
said
robin
and
when
it
made
me
think
human
beings
could
do
anything
if
they
tried
hard
enough
said
meg
and
when
you
read
the
pilgrim
s
progress
said
john
holt
and
the
first
afternoon
when
we
listened
to
jones
and
jerry
and
you
said
there
a
city
beautiful
said
meg
and
there
said
robin
and
we
ve
been
it
was
just
this
time
in
the
afternoon
said
meg
looking
about
her
the
red
light
was
dying
away
for
i
could
not
see
to
read
any
and
for
a
little
while
they
sat
in
the
straw
parlor
while
the
red
light
waned
and
afterwards
when
they
spoke
of
it
they
found
they
were
all
thinking
of
the
same
thing
and
it
was
of
the
last
day
they
had
spent
at
the
enchanted
city
when
they
had
gone
about
together
in
a
strange
tender
mood
loitering
through
the
white
palaces
lingering
about
the
clear
pools
of
green
sea
water
where
strange
creatures
swam
lazily
or
darted
to
and
fro
looking
their
last
at
pictures
and
stories
in
marble
and
listening
to
the
tinkle
of
water
plashing
under
great
tropical
leaves
and
over
strange
mosses
strolling
through
temples
and
past
savage
huts
and
gazing
in
final
questioning
at
mysterious
barbarous
faces
and
at
last
passing
through
the
stately
archway
and
being
borne
away
on
the
waters
of
the
great
lake
as
they
had
been
carried
away
farther
and
farther
and
the
white
wonder
had
begun
to
lose
itself
and
fade
into
a
white
spirit
of
a
strange
and
lovely
thing
meg
had
felt
the
familiar
throb
at
her
heart
and
the
familiar
lump
in
her
throat
and
she
had
broken
into
a
piteous
little
cry
oh
john
holt
she
said
it
is
going
it
is
going
and
we
shall
never
see
it
again
for
it
will
vanish
away
it
will
vanish
away
and
the
tears
rushed
down
her
cheeks
and
she
hid
her
face
on
his
arm
but
though
he
had
laughed
his
short
laugh
john
holt
had
made
her
lift
up
her
head
no
he
said
it
won
t
vanish
away
it
s
not
one
of
the
things
that
vanish
things
don
t
vanish
away
that
a
million
or
so
of
people
have
seen
as
they
ve
seen
this
they
stay
where
they
re
not
forgotten
and
time
doesn
t
change
them
they
re
put
where
they
can
be
passed
on
and
passed
on
again
and
thoughts
that
grow
out
of
them
bring
other
ones
and
what
things
may
grow
out
of
it
that
never
would
have
been
and
where
the
end
is
the
lord
only
knows
for
no
human
being
can
tell
it
won
