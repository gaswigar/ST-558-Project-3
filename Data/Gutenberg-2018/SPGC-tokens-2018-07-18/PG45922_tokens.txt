introduction
the
voyage
of
the
submarine
merchantman
deutschland
has
for
a
long
time
past
been
the
subject
of
eager
speculation
among
the
nations
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
the
wildest
rumours
regarding
the
fate
of
our
cruise
have
appeared
in
the
newspapers
to
say
nothing
of
the
pretty
imaginative
stories
in
which
the
english
have
announced
again
and
again
that
we
were
stranded
or
sunk
or
still
worse
dispatched
to
america
in
bales
of
cargo
how
often
we
chuckled
on
board
when
our
wireless
operator
picked
up
one
of
these
nice
english
wild
goose
stories
from
the
air
it
is
with
all
the
greater
pleasure
therefore
that
i
am
now
about
to
start
on
this
account
of
our
cruise
and
adventures
not
that
it
was
such
a
business
after
all
it
could
hardly
be
that
for
we
went
as
far
out
of
the
way
of
adventure
as
possible
readers
must
not
therefore
expect
to
find
in
this
little
book
a
series
of
thrilling
experiences
such
as
are
to
be
met
with
in
the
published
narratives
of
the
voyages
of
battleships
our
task
was
to
bring
our
valuable
cargo
to
america
as
smoothly
and
with
as
few
incidents
as
possible
to
get
the
better
of
the
english
blockade
and
to
return
safely
with
an
equally
valuable
cargo
this
we
succeeded
in
doing
as
the
following
account
will
show
but
as
events
will
prove
things
did
not
by
any
means
always
work
as
smoothly
as
they
might
have
done
and
if
at
times
we
were
in
a
pretty
tight
corner
and
much
occurred
that
was
not
on
our
programme
my
readers
must
thank
the
amiable
activities
of
the
english
for
all
these
exciting
little
incidents
in
spite
of
such
things
however
our
enemies
were
not
able
to
hinder
our
voyage
though
they
certainly
helped
very
materially
in
making
it
more
varied
and
interesting
and
it
would
be
ingratitude
on
our
part
not
to
acknowledge
this
and
here
i
must
specially
thank
my
two
officers
of
the
watch
krapohl
and
eyring
whose
notes
have
helped
to
make
this
account
complete
it
is
impossible
for
a
commander
to
be
always
on
the
i
had
almost
said
the
bridge
from
force
of
habit
and
six
eyes
see
further
than
two
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
careful
observation
is
necessary
above
everything
on
a
submarine
indeed
a
great
number
of
the
incidents
related
here
came
to
my
knowledge
through
the
observations
of
my
officers
throughout
the
cruise
they
proved
true
and
unflagging
companions
and
they
have
also
become
with
me
in
writing
this
account
of
the
voyage
my
thanks
are
due
to
them
even
more
than
to
the
english
and
i
trust
my
readers
gratitude
will
likewise
be
extended
to
them
when
they
have
read
this
book
the
author
the
voyage
of
the
deutschland
chapter
i
how
we
came
to
join
the
deutschland
and
what
i
thought
of
her
how
did
we
come
to
join
the
deutschland
that
is
a
long
story
which
i
shall
leave
the
authorities
to
relate
the
most
important
part
of
it
however
will
be
found
related
at
the
end
of
this
book
in
the
account
given
of
our
reception
at
the
bremen
town
hall
after
the
return
of
the
deutschland
from
the
united
states
to
me
the
idea
of
a
submarine
merchantman
that
has
been
built
for
long
voyages
is
the
tangible
expression
of
the
will
of
the
german
people
to
frustrate
the
effects
of
the
english
blockade
of
the
coasts
of
germany
and
america
and
of
the
entire
cutting
off
of
our
lawful
commercial
imports
the
hanseatic
enterprise
the
technical
ingenuity
of
german
shipbuilding
and
the
workmanlike
activities
of
one
of
our
greatest
dockyards
have
united
in
giving
english
domination
on
the
sea
the
biggest
blow
it
has
ever
had
since
the
union
jack
fluttered
over
the
waves
at
the
same
time
we
must
not
overlook
the
changes
and
developments
that
are
bound
to
follow
in
the
construction
and
use
of
submarine
merchantmen
thus
it
is
possible
that
the
methods
of
sea
warfare
will
be
entirely
revolutionised
that
new
conceptions
and
conditions
of
international
law
will
be
created
and
that
changes
in
the
commercial
relations
of
the
world
will
follow
which
may
influence
the
lives
of
peoples
even
more
strongly
than
the
present
is
doing
we
may
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
german
boat
that
has
ushered
in
this
new
epoch
our
achievement
is
not
to
be
minimised
by
the
fact
that
canadian
warships
have
crossed
the
atlantic
before
us
during
this
war
for
they
travelled
in
company
always
changing
and
accompanied
by
cruisers
and
auxiliaries
they
contained
only
provisions
and
ammunition
and
except
for
their
armament
had
no
dead
weight
to
carry
but
their
greatest
advantage
was
that
they
could
defend
themselves
if
necessary
whereas
the
only
defence
of
the
submarine
lies
in
submerging
and
that
is
not
everywhere
possible
with
a
huge
heavy
ship
of
nearly
tons
well
i
found
myself
faced
with
the
problem
of
taking
the
deutschland
to
america
an
entirely
novel
and
wonderful
task
it
would
have
been
a
new
one
to
me
moreover
if
i
had
not
been
as
i
was
an
old
north
german
lloyd
captain
of
a
large
clumsy
steamboat
but
a
young
commander
but
to
explain
this
i
must
first
relate
how
i
came
across
the
deutschland
events
moved
with
surprising
rapidity
in
connection
with
it
in
the
middle
of
october
i
was
in
berlin
on
business
i
had
then
been
obliged
to
leave
my
bonny
steamer
schleswig
for
some
time
but
the
north
german
lloyd
company
were
well
acquainted
with
my
whereabouts
one
evening
whilst
i
was
at
my
hotel
i
received
a
communication
with
an
urgent
invitation
to
visit
herr
lohmann
in
bremen
at
the
hotel
adlon
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
i
was
surprised
i
knew
the
name
of
the
head
of
the
famous
bremen
firm
very
well
and
had
been
personally
acquainted
at
one
time
with
herr
lohmann
in
sydney
where
his
firm
had
been
agents
for
the
north
german
lloyd
company
but
what
did
herr
lohmann
want
of
me
now
in
these
days
of
war
when
the
german
merchant
fleet
had
been
swept
from
off
the
seas
as
one
read
daily
in
the
english
newspapers
at
that
time
it
would
have
been
exceedingly
difficult
to
undertake
the
management
of
a
german
line
to
the
straits
and
australia
and
in
the
baltic
sea
the
firm
had
no
trade
connections
what
then
did
they
want
with
an
old
east
asia
america
and
mediterranean
captain
thus
i
ruminated
as
i
made
my
way
to
the
hotel
adlon
herr
lohmann
received
me
cordially
and
did
not
hold
me
long
in
suspense
he
alluded
to
the
fine
old
days
in
sydney
asked
me
how
i
liked
hanging
about
on
dry
land
and
if
i
would
care
again
to
undertake
a
long
voyage
what
could
an
old
merchant
captain
say
to
this
a
man
who
had
been
practically
obliged
to
leave
his
ship
in
an
enemy
country
and
lie
about
like
a
wreck
on
land
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
and
off
the
shetlands
the
cursed
english
cruisers
lay
in
wait
and
four
miles
from
new
york
even
the
american
post
on
neutral
ships
was
overhauled
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
was
silent
then
it
all
came
out
herr
lohmann
told
me
straight
away
that
he
was
thinking
of
starting
a
line
of
submarine
traders
to
america
and
asked
me
if
i
would
be
willing
to
take
command
of
the
first
boat
he
explained
that
the
first
voyage
was
to
be
to
and
asked
me
as
i
had
a
knowledge
through
my
voyages
on
the
baltimore
line
of
the
north
german
lloyd
ships
of
the
waters
and
depth
conditions
outside
chesapeake
bay
whether
i
thought
i
should
be
equal
to
taking
such
a
submarine
trader
safely
across
the
atlantic
if
the
matter
really
came
off
it
was
a
great
plan
i
was
never
one
for
weighing
pros
and
cons
and
so
i
said
yes
straight
away
this
was
indeed
a
chance
for
a
fellow
of
over
years
in
this
war
of
black
lists
and
daily
postal
robberies
to
do
something
herr
lohmann
i
said
if
the
matter
really
comes
off
you
can
count
on
me
and
the
matter
really
did
come
off
barely
two
months
had
elapsed
when
a
telegram
called
me
to
bremen
for
an
important
discussion
there
i
saw
designs
sketches
and
constructional
drawings
enough
to
make
me
open
my
eyes
wide
and
when
four
months
later
during
which
time
i
had
been
by
no
means
idle
i
travelled
to
kiel
there
rose
before
my
eyes
on
the
slips
a
strange
steel
object
trim
and
quite
harmless
she
lay
there
but
nevertheless
hidden
in
its
interior
was
the
realisation
of
all
those
detailed
overwhelmingly
complicated
figures
and
plans
i
can
not
say
that
the
completed
reality
even
then
helped
to
make
more
intelligible
those
blue
papers
with
their
endless
network
of
strokes
and
lines
which
had
so
dismayed
and
bewildered
the
mind
and
eye
any
of
my
readers
who
have
ever
seen
in
illustrated
papers
sketches
of
the
or
of
the
of
a
will
understand
this
indeed
when
they
are
face
to
face
with
such
a
wild
medley
of
rudders
valves
screws
cocks
tubes
and
pipes
with
such
a
bewildering
conglomeration
of
levers
and
apparatus
each
of
which
has
a
highly
important
meaning
and
purpose
let
them
take
comfort
my
impressions
were
just
the
same
but
when
this
monster
was
christened
and
her
giant
body
slipped
majestically
and
silently
into
the
water
she
was
suddenly
transformed
into
a
seafaring
vessel
a
vessel
that
swam
in
her
rightful
element
as
if
she
had
always
done
so
the
first
time
i
trod
her
narrow
deck
and
climbed
into
the
and
on
to
the
navigation
platform
it
was
only
from
her
sides
where
the
green
body
swelled
massively
out
of
the
water
that
it
was
possible
even
faintly
to
realise
how
enormous
her
hull
must
be
with
proud
delight
my
eyes
travelled
over
the
whole
structure
as
it
swayed
lightly
beneath
me
delicacy
and
strength
symbolically
blended
now
i
knew
that
what
had
hitherto
appeared
to
me
as
a
monstrous
product
of
technical
imagination
was
a
ship
in
which
i
could
travel
the
seas
a
real
ship
on
which
an
old
seaman
could
set
his
affections
then
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
parapet
of
the
conning
tower
of
the
deutschland
and
swore
to
be
true
to
her
and
in
this
manner
i
struck
the
deutschland
and
became
commander
of
the
first
submarine
chapter
ii
the
trial
and
departure
and
now
a
strange
and
wonderful
time
followed
day
after
day
out
into
the
bays
down
into
the
depths
we
practised
in
all
weathers
and
under
all
conditions
every
man
of
the
chosen
crew
realised
the
task
that
lay
before
us
it
meant
acquiring
the
art
of
managing
this
most
delicate
and
complicated
vessel
the
last
word
in
bold
and
skilful
construction
it
meant
learning
to
know
and
understand
that
marvellous
of
modern
shipbuilding
a
submarine
we
had
to
be
in
a
position
to
sway
according
to
our
will
this
heavy
mass
of
nearly
tons
so
that
she
should
obey
the
least
pressure
of
the
rudder
so
that
she
should
twist
and
manoeuvre
like
a
so
that
she
should
rise
and
sink
in
the
water
like
a
dirigible
in
the
air
it
meant
probing
the
trustworthiness
of
the
unyielding
steel
body
the
weight
and
pliability
of
her
mighty
machinery
getting
on
the
track
of
her
imperfections
or
tricks
and
coaxing
from
her
the
secrets
of
her
mobility
and
fantastic
fish
nature
a
submarine
is
as
full
of
humours
as
a
woman
and
as
tricky
as
a
racehorse
she
is
as
sober
as
a
and
as
trustworthy
as
a
tug
she
has
good
qualities
and
not
good
she
can
be
pliant
as
a
racing
yacht
and
as
as
a
mule
and
she
only
obeys
him
who
knows
her
down
to
her
smallest
technicalities
in
this
spirit
we
practised
for
weeks
round
about
above
and
below
water
we
studied
our
boat
and
tried
not
only
to
become
familiar
with
all
her
possibilities
but
to
penetrate
into
the
inner
mysteries
of
this
nautical
amphibian
and
when
we
returned
from
the
stillness
of
the
bay
to
the
noise
of
the
riveting
hammers
and
the
restless
hum
of
the
dockyard
we
would
sit
for
hours
with
the
constructors
and
exchange
our
experiences
this
practical
testing
gave
rise
to
much
stimulating
groundwork
for
new
plans
and
inventions
it
is
difficult
to
express
the
high
esteem
i
feel
for
the
men
of
the
dockyard
at
kiel
or
how
much
i
owe
to
their
they
were
untiringly
helpful
in
explaining
and
testing
this
wonderful
product
of
their
hands
and
brains
in
all
its
peculiarities
on
the
very
day
of
our
departure
the
ingenious
constructor
of
the
deutschland
erbach
came
out
to
our
place
of
anchorage
to
make
a
last
submerging
test
and
at
last
the
day
of
our
departure
arrived
the
deutschland
was
loaded
up
the
valuable
cargo
lay
well
packed
in
its
appointed
place
the
whole
boat
was
once
more
overhauled
and
brought
into
careful
trim
we
laid
in
provisions
for
the
long
journey
and
at
the
last
moment
even
cigars
and
gramophone
records
were
brought
on
board
with
these
all
our
possible
wants
were
securely
provided
for
and
the
deutschland
was
ready
for
the
voyage
we
were
ready
too
the
farewells
from
all
our
dear
ones
at
home
lay
god
be
thanked
behind
us
there
is
always
a
nasty
moment
in
connection
with
a
cruise
into
the
unknown
which
it
is
best
to
get
over
quickly
the
last
to
shake
us
by
the
hand
were
the
men
of
the
germania
dockyard
then
the
gangway
is
pulled
up
the
crew
take
up
their
stations
and
i
climb
into
the
the
lies
beside
us
and
takes
over
the
hawsers
i
call
down
to
the
look
out
and
raise
my
hand
the
great
moment
has
arrived
cast
off
the
aft
hawsers
they
off
tow
away
charlotte
is
presumably
the
name
of
the
tug
the
engine
telegraph
on
the
stout
little
sounds
the
sturdy
craft
strains
at
the
and
slowly
the
stern
of
our
deutschland
is
drawn
away
from
her
in
the
dock
cast
off
the
bow
hawsers
they
are
off
and
with
a
smack
the
last
hawsers
fall
from
the
pier
wall
into
the
black
seething
waters
of
the
harbour
now
we
are

i
take

his

it
possible
to
realise
that
the
engines
are
working
slowly
the
big
green
whale
back
twists
and
turns
lies
first
broadside
on
in
the
fairway
then
slightly
to
port
then
turns
with
the
help
of
the
tug
once
more
to
port
and
astern
stop
both
engines
slowly
the
boat
moves
slightly
backwards
pulling
at

its
backward
movements
like
some
primeval
monster
a
quick
glance
from
the
over
the
trail
of
water
and
the
pier
walls
we
have
enough
room
to
manoeuvre
the
hawsers
are
cast
off
and
then
both
engines
are
set
at
with
rudder
to
port
we
turn
once
more
to
get
well
clear
of
the
dock
walls
where
a
big
grey
battle
cruiser
is
being
finally
equipped
then
i
let

amidships
and
order

journey
begins

faster
the

her
way
through
the
dirty

of

into

chapter
iii
the
first
day
at
sea
the
north
sea
rolls
in
long
swells
against
us
the
weather
is
clear
and
the
wind
blows
sharply
from
i
am
standing
alone
with
my
first
officer
on
duty
on
the
in
the
for
thus
we
have
nicknamed
the
strong
shelter
which
is
built
round
the
hatch
of
the
deutschland
and
which
looks
like
a
kind
of
flying
gondola
in
front
of
this
is
the
upper
steering
station
which
can
however
only
be
made
use
of
in
fine
weather
we
stand
in
oilskins
behind
the
shelter
for
the
sea
is
already
quite
rough
enough
to
wet
everything
through
the
deck
is
continually
swamped
and
every
minute
the
waves
break
over
the
tower
i
listen
with
the
to
the
in
my
hand
while
the
helmsman
growls
commands
through
the
telegraph
to
the
a
dull
roar
the
bow
dips
down
foaming
and
the
waves
rush
over
the
deck
and
dash
high
against
the
as
quick
as
lightning
we
close
the
hatches
and
duck
in
our
crackling
oilskins
behind
the
shelter
this
little
game
is
repeated
every
five
minutes
between
whiles
we
stand
up
listening
to
the
wind
rattling
in
the
stays
of
the
masts
and
look
around
us
for
some
time
the
german
coast
has
faded
from
sight
behind
us
in
the
and
the
accompanying
which
travels
in
front
of
us
is
the
last
bit
of
the
homeland
soon
we
approach
the
last
line
of
german
outposts
four
vessels
pass
by
us
in
single
file
and
signal
us
pleasant
voyage
our
faithful
companion
now
approaches
nearer
her
crew
give
us
three
hearty
cheers
the
officers
on
the
bridge
salute
and
we
two
lonely
men
on
the
tower
return
the
salute
then
the
little
black
boat
ducks
into
the
sea
makes
a
beautiful
turn
stirring
up
the
foaming
water
at
her
keel
grows
smaller
and
smaller
and
presently
disappears
leaving
a
thin
drifting
behind
her
we
are
left
to
ourselves
and
travel
into
the
unknown
not
much
time
however
is
allowed
for
thinking
danger
now
threatens
us
from
all
sides
and
i
have
to
make
certain
that
the
boat
is
in
good
trim
and
that
i
have
the
engines
and
submerging
appliances
well
in
hand
i
give
the
command
clear
everything
for
a
submerging
test
at
once
the
response
comes
back
from
and
and
the
crew
hurry
to
their
submerging
stations
the
oil
engines
are
still
throbbing
and
hammering
then
the
alarm
bell
is
sounded
and
i
spring
into
the
the
hatches
are
closed
and
at
the
same
time
the
oil
engines
cease
working
for
a
moment
one
is
conscious
of
a
slight
pressure
in
the
ears
we
are
shut
up
from
outside
and
all
is
still
but
there
is
no
real
silence
only
a
change
of
sound
then
comes
the
command
open
the
submerging
valves
flood
what
now
follows
is
so
strangely
impressive
that
one
could
never
forget
it
once
having
experienced
it
the
submerging
valves
are
quickly
opened
and
with
a
hiss
the
compressed
air
rushes
out
of
the
tanks
a
gigantic
volume
of
air
rises
with
such
an
unearthly
snorting
and
blowing
that
the
pressure
in
one
ears
becomes
almost
painful
then
the
noise
becomes
more
even
and
is
followed
by
a
loud
humming
and
whistling
and
all
the
high
notes
of
the
machinery
in
the
join
together
and
produce
a
confusion
of
sounds
it
is
like
the
strains
of
some
mad
diabolical
music
that
after
the
dull
heavy
hammering
of
the
oil
engines
gives
a
momentary
impression
of
unearthliness
that
is
at
once
penetrating
and
impressive
this
noise
in
the
valves
is
a
sign
that
the
submerging
mechanism
is
at
work
the
music
continues
but
in
a
long
downward
scale
and
during
these
long
drawn
out
sounds
one
has
a
bodily
feeling
as
of
the
rushing
in
and
flooding
of
mighty
masses
of
water
one
seems
oneself
to
grow
heavier
and
to
sink
with
the
boat
through
the
window
of
the
and
by
the
aid
of
the
periscope
it
is
now
possible
to
observe
how
the
front
part
of
the
boat
is
sinking
the
railings
are
cutting
their
foaming
way
through
the
waves
while
the
water
round
the
rises
higher
and
higher
till
everything
outside
is
wrapped
in
the
wonderful
twilight
of
the
deep
only
our
faithful
lamps
are
shining
now
it
has
indeed
become
silent
the
only
sound
that
reaches
the
ears
is
the
soft
swaying
rhythm
of
the
electric
engines
then
comes
the
command
go
down
to
eleven
fathoms
both
engines
ahead
by
the
gauge
i
can
follow
the
depths
we
are
making
through
the
flooding
we
have
added
several
tons
of
dead
weight
to
the
boat
we
have
made
the
closed
up
ship
body
heavier
than
the
mass
of
water
displaced
and
our
giant
fish
sinks
almost
falls
into
her
element
down
below
at
the
same
time
we
are
moving
with
the
electric
engines
and
the
forward
thrust
of
the
propeller
brings
pressure
and
reaction
upon
the
diving
rudder
and
transforms
the
sinking
into
a
downward
gliding
movement
when
the
desired
depth
is
reached
which
i
can
tell
at
once
from
the
depth
gauge
further
sinking
is
prevented
by
the
simple
means
of
making
the
boat
lighter
again
through
pumping
out
the
superfluous
water
from
the
submersion
tanks
the
furious
working
of
the
pumps
is
thus
always
the
sign
that
we
are
approaching
the
desired
depth
then
it
stops
only
the
electric
engines
continue
humming
and
from
the
comes
the
announcement
we
are
lying
at
eleven
fathoms
boat
is
trimmed
we
are
travelling
at
a
depth
of
eleven
fathoms
this
means
that
we
are
practically
blind
and
can
only
judge
our
way
by
the
depth
gauge
and
by
the
help
of
that
carefully
protected
boat
treasure
the
no
glimmer
from
outside
now
reaches
us
the
periscope
has
long
been
swallowed
up
and
the
steel
safety
shutters
in
the
windows
of
the
are
tightly
closed
we
are
entirely
transformed
into
the
character
of
a
fish
now
the
communications
from
all
compartments
holds
accumulator
rooms
come
through
without
a
hitch
we
can
travel
safely
with
our
deutschland
in
the
deeps
it
is
not
always
however
such
an
easy
matter
to
bring
a
boat
of
this
size
down
to
a
prescribed
depth
the
changes
in
the
specific
weight
of
the
water
owing
to
varying
temperatures
or
to
the
different
proportions
of
salt
held
in
solution
play
a
very
important
rôle
how
strong
an
influence
this
can
prove
i
will
show
in
the
difference
between
the
baltic
and
north
sea
waters
the
specific
gravities
of
the
two
seas
are
in
the
proportions
of
to
this
difference
in
itself
may
not
appear
very
considerable
with
a
boat
however
of
the
size
of
the
deutschland
for
the
submersion
of
which
a
very
heavy
excess
weight
of
many
tons
is
necessary
very
important
consequences
are
bound
to
follow
from
this
difference
in
specific
gravity
thus
in
order
to
submerge
in
the
heavier
waters
of
the
north
sea
it
is
necessary
to
make
the
boat
at
least
seventeen
tons
heavier
than
in
the
baltic
as
otherwise
we
should
not
sink
moreover
during
sudden
alterations
in
the
temperature
of
the
water
in
the
bays
and
river
mouths
where
the
lighter
fresh
water
comes
in
the
most
unpleasant
surprises
often
occur
many
a
commander
has
thought
it
possible
with
a
certain
amount
of
excess
weight
to
submerge
without
difficulty
and
to
keep
his
boat
at
a
fixed
depth
suddenly
however
the
pressure
gauge
registers
a
greater
depth
and
the
boat
drops
in
the
water
like
an
aeroplane
which
has
fallen
into
an
until
a
test
of
the
specific
weight
and
temperature
of
the
water
gives
the
clue
to
her
behaviour
it
will
therefore
be
seen
that
such
measurements
are
necessary
before
the
commander
can
count
with
certainty
on
being
able
suddenly
to
submerge
and
as
suddenly
to
reappear
above
the
waters
in
the
meantime
we
have
finished
our
submerging
test
satisfactorily
all
has
gone
well
and
each
part
fully
performed
its
functions
we
are
in
complete
control
of
our
complicated
apparatus
now
the
command
to
reappear
is
given
the
diving
rudders
are
set
to
up
and
immediately
i
am
able
by
the
depth
gauge
to
follow
their
working
and
that
of
our
stout
pumps
after
assuring
myself
that
there
is
no
noise
of
propellers
to
be
heard
anywhere
in
our
vicinity
and
that
on
all
sides
there
is
no
likelihood
of
collision
with
any
steamer
we
pass
through
the
dangerous
blind
moment
by
this
i
mean
that
space
of
time
during
which
the
boat
has
risen
so
high
that
she
could
be
rammed
while
on
the
other
hand
she
is
still
too
deep
under
the
water
to
get
the
periscope
above
the
surface
and
take
a
look
round
this
lasts
a
few
minutes
i
stand
at
the
periscope
and
watch
already
the
field
of
vision
is
lighter
silvery
air
bubbles
rise
up
glittering
a
blinking
and
twinkling
appears
on
the
glass
then
it
is
day
a
picture
arises
clear
and
shining
the
north
sea
sways
before
my
eyes
with
an
empty
and
endless
horizon
now
we
are
rising
to
the
surface
by
the
use
of
the
rudder
the
boat
pushes
forward
faster
and
faster
to
the
surface
of
the
water
in
order
to
accelerate
the
ascent
compressed
air
is
forced
into
one
of
the
submersion
tanks
now
she
moves
very
rapidly
the
tower
is
already
free
the
deck
rises
dripping
out
of
the
water
the
hatch
is
opened
fresh
air
streams
in
and
i
give
the
command
blow
out
ballast
tanks
a
wild
howling
and
screeching
comes
in
reply
from
the
while
the
powerful
turbine
engine
presses
the
water
out
from
the
submerging
tanks
this
does
not
take
long
as
soon
as
a
tank
is
empty
the
excess
air
rushes
out
with
a
pleasant
sound
at
the
side
of
the
boat
and
we
are
soon
in
normal
floating
trim
again
we
are
still
using
electricity
now
comes
last
of
all
the
starting
up
of
the
heavy
diesel
engines
by
the
electric
motors
i
have
already
climbed
into
the
and
can
see
nothing
of
all
this
except
by
the
communications
from
the
those
who
are
in
the
however
will
have
an
exciting
spectacle
the
observation
engineers
stand
at
their
posts
a
command
comes
through
the
everything
is
ready
then
the
chief
engineer
gives
a
shrill
whistle
raises
his
hand
two
quick
wrenches
at
the
switchboard
in
the
electrical
a
couple
of
blinding
flashes
half
an
inch
long
the
first
rise
slowly
hesitatingly
as
if
unwilling
then
quicker
a
wild
report
and
hissing
a
wild
irregular
spluttering
then
the
loud
explosions
become
rhythmical
and
faster
and
faster
both
machines
resume
their
regular
vibrations
the
submerging
test
is
completed
and
pounding
along
the
deutschland
proceeds
on
her
way
the
wind
does
not
drop
but
the
weather
keeps
fine
and
the
visibility
is
good
no
steamer
comes
in
sight
we
can
remain
comfortably
above
water
nevertheless
we
need
to
be
extremely
careful
in
our
navigation
so
the
day
draws
to
its
end
but
as
the
sun
sinks
dark
threatening
clouds
appear
prophesying
bad
weather
for
the
following
day
chapter
iv
the
trap
and
thus
it
turns
out
the
further
we
get
from
land
the
rougher
grows
the
sea
the
boat
is
badly
tossed
about
i
notice
the
roughness
of
the
sea
as
i
lie
in
my
cabin
and
towards
two
in
the
morning
i
am
awakened
by
a
hullo
from
the
on
the
wall
at
my
head
the
watchful
second
officer
eyring
announces
a
white
light
to
starboard
which
is
approaching
rapidly
i
spring
out
balancing
myself
round
the
corner
in
the
over
the
ladders
up
through
the
hatch
on
to
the
platform
eyring
shows
me
at
no
great
distance
ahead
a
white
light
it
appears
to
be
approaching
we
decide
not
to
let
it
come
any
nearer
and
give
the
alarm
to
submerge
then
for
the
first
time
i
realise
the
wonderful
sense
of
security
that
the
possibility
of
such
a
rapid
submersion
gives
it
is
all
quite
a
matter
of
course
here
we
travel
in
the
middle
of
this
with
an
unarmed
freight
vessel
through
darkest
night
a
light
approaches
it
may
be
an
enemy
it
probably
is
in
a
few
minutes
a
couple
of
shots
may
flash
out
several
shells
shatter
our
the
water
stream
into
the
ship
body
and
in
a
short
while
the
north
sea
close
over
us
none
of
this
occurs
however
a
brief
command
in
the
a
few
grips
of
the
valves
and
hand
wheels
and
we
continue
our
way
unhurt
for
brutal
power
may
shut
us
from
the
surface
of
the
seas
but
our
enemies
in
their
impotence
only
cause
us
to
lie
a
few
fathoms
deeper
we
continue
submerged
for
the
sake
of
safety
until
daybreak
towards
four
we
rise
to
the
surface
it
is
already
broad
daylight
but
unfortunately
also
there
is
a
very
troubled
sea
in
the
distance
we
see
a
couple
of
laboriously
going
about
their
business
we
keep
them
at
first
sharply
under
inspection
but
quickly
discover
their
harmless
character
and
continue
our
way
over
the
water
this
process
has
long
ceased
to
be
of
a
pleasant
character
the
movements
of
the
boat
are
such
that
existence
down
below
in
the
compartments
aired
only
by
the
ventilator
machines
is
causing
headache
and
sickness
among
the
men
part
of
the
crew
are
losing
their
appetites
yet
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
to
remain
on
deck
which
is
continuously
swept
by
the
seas
it
is
somewhat
drier
on
the
behind
the
shelter
of
the
and
on
the
lee
side
of
the
tower
which
is
sheltered
from
the
sea
and
wind
here
a
few
of
the
watch
off
duty
are
huddled
together
holding
fast
to
the
rails
inhaling
the
fresh
air
and
shaking
themselves
when
a
particularly
heavy
breaker
rolls
up
round
the
covering
them
in
salt
spray
thus
we
travel
on
the
whole
day
a
couple
of
steamers
whose
appear
in
the
distance
we
avoid
above
water
by
altering
our
course
after
we
have
made
out
their
route
by
careful
sounding
and
observation
this
sounds
more
difficult
than
it
really
is
you
first
of
all
make
sure
of
the
position
of
your
own
ship
by
soundings
and
calculations
after
you
have
roughly
estimated
the
position
of
the
unknown
vessel
on
the
map
if
the
relative
positions
of
these
two
are
compared
on
the
map
with
the
most
important
steamer
routes
it
is
possible
to
judge
with
some
certainty
the
course
the
unknown
ship
must
take
such
a
calculation
was
soon
to
prove
of
great
importance
to
us
and
was
in
this
case
as
will
be
seen
of
great
significance
towards
evening
it
clears
up
slightly
and
the
sea
grows
calmer
the
sun
sets
under
brilliantly
illuminated
clouds
in
the
west
all
the
watch
off
duty
have
come
on
deck
to
get
some
fresh
air
and
smoke
a
hasty
cigar
or
cigarette
below
deck
smoking
is
strictly
forbidden
the
men
are
all
huddled
together
on
the
sheltered
side
of
the
tightly
packed
and
pressed
against
the
wall
it
is
a
strange
sight
rather
like
a
swarm
of
bees
this
cluster
of
men
in
rough
heavy
sea
clothes
there
is
not
much
etiquette
observed
here
i
know
the
men
have
no
easy
job
down
below
there
and
when
one
of
them
sticks
his
head
through
the
tower
hatch
to
draw
a
few
puffs
at
his
pipe
i
gladly
grant
him
the
short
respite
moreover
all
eyes
are
fixed
unconsciously
on
the
horizon
and
this
is
a
good
thing
the
more
men
there
are
to
watch
the
more
can
be
observed
and
many
of
our
crew
have
the
eyes
of
an
eagle
suddenly
in
the
clear
twilight
of
the
june
evening
two
masts
appear
in
the
distance
on
the
port
side
a
funnel
follows
and
soon
the
hull
of
a
steamer
appears
on
the
verge
of
the
horizon
with
the
help
of
our
excellent
prismatic
glasses
we
hold
her
steadily
under
observation
our
object
being
to
make
out
her
course
in
order
to
steer
clear
of
her
we
have
soon
measured
her
distance
and
i
take
up
the
map
compare
reckon
look
at
the
vessel
again
then
pause
bewildered
from
the
course
she
is
following
the
steamer
will
never
reach
a
port
is
it
possible
then
i
call
up
krapohl
and
point
out
to
him
my
calculations
we
have
another
good
look
through
the
glasses
compare
maps
they
agree
the
fellow
is
following
no
route
whatever
in
the
meanwhile
we
had
approached
near
enough
to
make
the
steamer
out
distinctly
the
twilight
of
the
june
evening
is
so
clear
and
bright
that
we
can
observe
her
with
the
greatest
accuracy
she
is
a
fine
steamer
of
medium
size
and
carries
a
neutral
flag
while
her
hull
is
painted
in
the
colours
of
her
country
in
the
middle
of
the
hull
is
a
long
double
name
which
we
can
not
however
read
suddenly
krapohl
cries
good
heavens
how
is
it
that
she
is
flying
her
flag
so
long
after
sunset
is
it
mere
chance
i
wonder
and
what
does
that
extraordinary
coat
of
paint
on
her
hull
signify
she
is
a
suspicious
looking
craft
i
am
forced
to
agree
with
him
the
apparently
aimless
course
of
the
steamer
fills
me
with
amazement
it
is
not
usual
to
take
a
on
the
north
sea
for
amusement
in
the
middle
of
this
we
consider
what
is
to
be
done
as
yet
the
steamer
has
not
sighted
us
she
continues
her
mysterious
course
and
by
this
time
lies
a
little
astern
of
us
i
decide
nevertheless
not
to
submerge
as
our
courses
must
soon
diverge
suddenly
the
steamer
makes
a
rapid
turn
and
comes
straight
towards
us
now
we
can
see
that
the
sturdy
neutral
has
swung
out
her
boats
obviously
with
intent
to
make
more
complete
her
character
of
a
peaceful
merchantman
is
ready
and
prepared
to
follow
all
commands
this
remarkable
civility
on
her
part
is
quite
sufficient
for
us
i
send
all
the
crew
below
deck
and
give
the
alarm
at
once
we
make
ready
to
submerge
and
in
doing
so
move
towards
the
steamer
in
order
to
lie
broadside
on
to
the
sea
which
makes
diving
easier
then
to
our
great
amazement
the
following
incident
occurs
hardly
has
the
neutral
ship
observed
our
movements
and
noticed
that
we
are
submerging
than
she
twists
round
with
a
jerk
as
we
submerge
we
can
still
watch
her
as
she
wends
her
characteristic
zigzag
course
puffing
out
thick
clouds
of
smoke
behind
her
this
confession
of
a
bad
conscience
struck
us
profoundly
never
have
we
laughed
so
heartily
as
over
the
flight
of
this
honest
merchantman
with
her
unknown
course
the
artful
dodger
thought
she
was
found
out
and
feared
any
moment
we
might
send
a
torpedo
into
her
ribs
and
how
furious
she
must
have
been
it
would
have
been
so
fine
to
approach
quite
near
to
the
pest
in
the
character
of
neutral
ship
and
then
at
a
safe
distance
to
let
the
mask
of
harmlessness
drop
and
shoot
through
the
the
trap
was
so
beautifully
laid
the
german
pirate
had
only
to
go
just
a
little
nearer
instead
we
described
a
curve
under
water
and
only
rose
to
the
surface
again
two
hours
later
first
i
searched
the
horizon
with
the
aid
of
the
periscope
then
i
opened
the
hatch
of
the
which
was
still
half
submerged
in
order
to
get
a
look
round
with
the
glasses
the
air
was
clear
in
the
south
the
moon
had
risen
making
the
dusky
light
of
the
summer
night
even
more
transparent
but
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
sea
was
empty
no
steamer
was
in
sight
the
deutschland
could
continue
her
way
unlighted
and
besides
our
huge
delight
over
the
disappointment
of
the
crafty
i
had
now
the
certainty
that
we
could
see
all
vessels
before
they
could
see
us
and
that
was
no
small
matter
chapter
v
a
somersault
in
the
north
sea
that
night
during
the
darkest
hours
between
eleven
and
one
i
had
decided
to
travel
submerged
with
the
electric
engines
when
we
submerged
in
the
twilight
of
the
long
summer
night
there
had
been
very
little
wind
but
there
was
a
heavy
swell
a
sure
sign
that
the
wind
would
rise
to
a
storm
within
a
few
hours
towards
two
i
gave
the
order
to
rise
to
the
surface
and
soon
noticed
from
the
increasingly
wild
movements
of
the
boat
that
the
storm
had
arisen
and
that
a
rougher
sea
must
have
set
in
with
it
at
times
we
made
regular
springs
but
continued
steadily
blowing
out
from
our
tanks
and
came
to
the
surface
in
good
order
from
the
lower
end
of
the
periscope
i
tried
to
get
my
bearings
it
was
however
almost
impossible
to
see
anything
as
the
periscope
was
continually
enveloped
by
the
heavy
breakers
the
dim
light
causing
the
huge
waves
to
assume
monstrous
and
uncanny
proportions
now
we
had
risen
entirely
to
the
surface
and
i
climbed
into
the
to
get
a
proper
outlook
over
the
wildly
dancing
sea
it
had
become
pleasant
weather
indeed
in
the
pale
dim
light
was
visible
a
seething
witch
cauldron
of
tossing
mountainous
waves
crowned
with
foam
from
which
the
wind
tore
away
the
spray
and
hurtled
it
through
the
air
the
boat
struggled
heavily
against
it
and
made
little
headway
the
entire
deck
was
of
course
flooded
and
every
moment
the
sea
dashed
up
over
the
and
fell
over
me
in
showers
of
spray
i
clung
on
to
the
parapet
of
the
and
scanned
the
horizon
a
strange
outlook
one
continually
shifting
scene
of
mountainous
rollers
i
was
just
about
to
give
the
order
to
start
the
oil
engines
working
when
what
is
that
over
there
that
dark
streak
yonder
surely
it
is
a
line
of
smoke
then
the
back
of
a
wave
blots
it
out
for
a
moment
from
the
pale
grey
sky
i
wait
staring
through
the
glass
till
my
eyes
ache
there
it
is
again
a
dark
line
of
smoke
and
there
there
a
masthead
thin
as
a
needle
yet
i
can
see
it
through
my
glasses
and
now
my
eyes
are
boring
their
way
through
the
glasses
that
black
thing
over
there
just
visible
in
the
valley
of
the
waves
the
smoke
above
it
four
low
funnels
good
heavens
it
is
a
destroyer
with
one
bound
i
spring
into
the
close
the
hatch
alarm
submerge
quickly
flood
the
tanks
diving
rudder
eleven
fathoms
down
the
commands
follow
each
other
in
rapid
succession
but
to
carry
them
out
is
a
different
matter
to
submerge
head
on
to
this
sea
will
be
from
all
experience
sheer
madness
but
what
am
i
to
do
the
destroyer
may
have
seen
us
already
down
we
must
go
and
as
quickly
as
possible
below
me
in
the
the
crew
are
working
in
speechless
haste
the
emergency
air
valves
are
opened
the
compressed
air
hisses
out
of
the
tanks
the
submersion
valves
sing
in
all
their
scales
i
stand
with
compressed
lips
looking
through
the
tower
window
over
the
tossing
sea
around
me
waiting
for
the
first
sign
of
sinking
but
still
i
can
see
our
deck
still
the
waves
toss
us
up
high
into
the
air
we
have
no
more
time
to
lose
i
order
more
play
to
diving
rudders
and
give
the
command
both
engines
full
speed
ahead
the
whole
boat
trembles
and
sways
under
the
increased
engine
power
and
gives
a
couple
of
springs
she
staggers
and
reels
is
she
never
going
to
sink
then
with
a
jerk
she
dips
suddenly
under
by
the
bow
and
disappears
rapidly
at
an
angle
beneath
the
waves
the
daylight
which
is
just
dawning
in
at
the
window
disappears
the
depth
gauge
shows
in
rapid
succession
one
one
and
a
half
three
five
fathoms
but
still
the
angle
of
the
boat
increases
we
stagger
lean
backwards
slip
over
losing
all
grip
on
the
floor
which
is
sinking
forward
i
am
still
just
able
to
hold
on
to
the
of
the
periscope
and
down
below
in
the
the
men
are
holding
fast
on
to
the
of
the
diving
rudders
this
lasts
for
several
terrible
moments
we
are
still
wondering
what
on
earth
has
happened
when
suddenly
there
comes
a
heavy
blow
we
are
thrown
to
the
ground
in
all
directions
and
everything
that
is
not
nailed
securely
down
is
hurled
around
us
we
find
ourselves
in
the
strangest
positions
look
at
each
other
and
for
a
moment
a
deadly
silence
prevails
then
the
first
officer
krapohl
observes
dryly
well
we
got
there
anyway
this
broke
the
horrible
tension
we
had
all
grown
pretty
pale
and
now
we
began
to
try
and
face
the
situation
what
had
happened
why
this
unnatural
angle
of
the
boat
and
why
were
the
engines
pounding
so
madly
above
us
that
the
whole
boat
quivered
and
shook
before
any
of
us
had
time
to
think
however
our
little
klees
the
steering
engineer
had
sprung
from
his
cowering
position
and
quick
as
lightning
had
pulled
the
telegraph
round
to
stop
as
suddenly
a
deep
silence
followed
slowly
we
collected
our
various
limbs
together
and
considered
what
had
happened
the
boat
was
standing
on
her
head
so
to
speak
with
her
sloping
downwards
at
an
angle
of
her
bow
must
be
touching
ground
while
the
stern
was
obediently
oscillating
in
the
air
above
water
the
gauge
meanwhile
showed
a
depth
of
about
eight
fathoms
i
took
a
rapid
stock
of
our
situation
it
was
far
from
pleasant
according
to
the
map
there
should
be
here
a
depth
of
about
seventeen
and
a
half
fathoms
judging
from
the
almost
upright
position
of
our
long
boat
our
stern
must
be
projecting
a
considerable
way
above
water
making
thereby
an
admirable
target
for
enemy
destroyers
as
long
as
the
engines
continued
working
it
followed
that
as
the
waves
passed
over
us
the
propeller
lashing
partly
in
the
air
was
increasing
our
power
of
attraction
by
causing
fountains
of
leaping
water
and
foaming
whirlpools
this
klees
had
realised
through
the
mad
pounding
of
the
engines
and
by
his
presence
of
mind
had
removed
the
greatest
danger
all
the
same
we
had
marked
our
with
the
strangest
of
buoys
and
expected
every
moment
to
hear
bombs
crashing
through
the
stem
of
our
boat
as
it
hung
high
in
the
air
above
us
moments
of
extreme
tension
followed
but
all
was
still
the
screws
could
no
longer
betray
us
and
it
was
probably
still
too
dark
above
for
them
to
be
noticeable
the
destroyer
moreover
had
no
doubt
enough
to
do
in
looking
after
herself
in
this
rough
sea
it
will
be
understood
however
that
we
were
particularly
anxious
to
get
out
of
this
absurd
position
as
quickly
as
possible
as
the
boat
was
still
quite
intact
and
had
sustained
the
fearful
shock
without
the
least
damage
the
rest
of
the
programme
was
easy
enough
to
carry
out
the
stern
tanks
which
were
not
quite
freed
of
air
were
quickly
flooded
and
so
gradually
the
boat
attained
a
slightly
more
normal
position
nevertheless
she
still
lay
far
from
the
horizontal
she
had
stuck
her
nose
too
fast
in
the
mud
for
that
by
this
time
however
we
were
at
least
entirely
under
water
and
could
finish
the
rest
of
our
work
in
peace
part
of
the
water
was
forced
out
from
the
fore
ballast
tanks
and
for
the
rest
we
continued
trimming
the
boat
with
the
tanks
until
the
bow
became
loosened
from
the
ground
now
we
began
to
rise
and
were
immediately
obliged
to
check
her
in
order
to
counteract
the
immediate
tendency
of
the
stern
to
descend
after
some
time
however
the
balance
was
readjusted
and
the
deutschland
was
firmly
in
hand
again
and
now
we
had
to
consider
what
could
have
been
the
cause
of
this
sudden
blunder
on
the
part
of
our
otherwise
gallant
boat
a
great
many
circumstances
must
have
combined
to
produce
it
apart
from
the
fact
that
it
is
only
possible
in
rare
cases
to
submerge
a
heavy
boat
in
a
rough
sea
it
is
conceivable
that
owing
to
the
haste
enforced
on
us
by
the
destroyer
the
tanks
had
not
been
quite
pumped
out
the
chief
reason
however
appeared
to
be
the
sudden
dynamic
working
of
the
diving
rudders
this
in
combination
with
full
engine
power
and
the
downward
pressure
of
a
particularly
heavy
sea
forced
the
fateful
gradient
too
suddenly
we
found
ourselves
in
the
position
of
a
dirigible
which
steers
too
low
before
landing
and
through
a
sudden
downward
current
of
air
is
flattened
and
crushed
to
the
ground
by
the
double
weight
fortunately
for
us
the
wonderful
material
of
our
steel
body
stood
the
heavy
blow
undamaged
only
the
bottom
of
the
north
sea
may
have
suffered
a
little
indentation
at
latitude
and
longitude
one
thing
more
strikes
me
as
worth
mentioning
in
connection
with
this
event
when
i
look
back
in
retrospect
on
my
thoughts
as
we
dived
at
full
speed
through
the
deeps
at
an
angle
of
degrees
i
must
confess
my
first
thought
was
for
the
cargo
was
the
cargo
safely
stored
could
it
possibly
shoot
overboard
the
thought
came
quite
instinctively
strange
though
it
seemed
to
me
afterwards
i
could
not
shake
myself
free
of
the
old
adam
as
captain
of
a
heavy
steamer
even
on
board
a
chapter
vi
out
into
the
open
we
had
had
more
than
enough
of
the
north
sea
by
this
time
and
were
now
quite
ready
to
get
out
into
the
open
we
were
quite
clear
as
to
our
route
thank
goodness
less
so
as
to
what
might
happen
to
us
on
the
voyage
but
we
were
prepared
by
now
for
any
little
surprises
that
might
occur
for
why
travel
in
a
submarine
if
there
are
no
difficulties
to
be
overcome
after
all
many
had
passed
successfully
through
the
north
sea
and
reached
the
open
ocean
moreover
they
had
had
many
dangerous
duties
to
carry
out
while
we
had
only
to
take
care
not
to
be
seen
and
to
slip
out
as
quietly
as
possible
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
not
only
that
we
had
not
to
be
seen
our
chief
care
was
that
we
should
not
be
recognised
as
a
trader
the
peculiar
character
of
the
deutschland
as
a
peaceful
unarmed
merchant
trader
would
not
have
protected
us
in
the
least
from
being
sunk
at
sight
of
that
we
were
convinced
and
how
right
we
were
was
seen
in
the
later
english
and
french
official
declarations
if
we
were
once
recognised
as
a
trader
we
should
have
been
not
only
in
danger
every
minute
but
our
unhampered
arrival
at
the
american
port
of
our
destination
would
be
highly
endangered
we
should
have
had
a
whole
pack
of
thirsty
bloodhounds
in
our
wake
we
hoped
therefore
to
take
the
whole
world
by
surprise
by
our
arrival
in
america
and
all
our
ambitions
were
strained
towards
this
achievement
thus
i
meditated
as
we
neared
the
danger
zone
we
moved
forward
therefore
with
great
caution
we
saw
a
great
deal
in
the
process
were
seen
ourselves
extremely
seldom
recognised
never
during
the
day
we
avoided
several
steamers
by
altering
our
course
at
night
we
travelled
with
darkened
lights
submerging
when
necessary
the
weather
also
favoured
us
once
we
sighted
an
english
auxiliary
cruiser
some
distance
off
she
was
travelling
in
a
definite
direction
with
a
zigzag
course
for
some
time
we
held
a
parallel
course
with
her
keeping
her
carefully
under
observation
but
owing
to
the
high
seas
which
must
have
made
her
navigation
far
from
pleasant
we
remained
unnoticed
on
another
occasion
a
vessel
approached
us
in
the
evening
twilight
she
had
seen
us
and
hailed
us
with
the
english
merchant
flag
to
signify
harmlessness
and
thus
mislead
us
for
an
attack
as
we
continued
calmly
on
our
way
she
moved
off
in
vexation
the
sea
was
probably
too
rough
for
her
to
seek
further
communication
with
us
we
were
easily
able
to
avoid
other
vessels
travelling
at
an
even
higher
rate
later
on
it
grew
calm
and
misty
we
submerged
and
came
to
rest
on
the
bottom
we
were
in
no
hurry
and
why
should
we
not
take
a
little
rest
it
was
not
what
might
be
called
exactly
shallow
in
that
spot
it
was
in
fact
extremely
deep
all
the
more
calm
and
safe
a
for
what
else
were
our
excellent
lead
machine
and
the
wonderfully
stout
body
of
our
deutschland
that
night
on
the
bed
of
the
ocean
at
x
was
a
great
relaxation
for
us
all
we
were
able
once
more
to
have
a
good
wash
and
rest
without
fear
of
being
immediately
awakened
by
a
hullo
from
the
but
first
of
all
we
dined
a
real
proper
dinner
the
two
gramophones
played
gaily
and
we
clinked
our
glasses
together
which
were
filled
possibly
out
of
compliment
with
french
champagne
our
faithful
stucke
steward
second
cook
and
servant
to
us
all
waited
on
us
with
earnest
solemnity
just
as
if
he
were
still
steward
in
the
of
the
kronprinzessin
cäcilie
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
that
he
had
been
a
prisoner
in
france
for
nearly
a
year
it
was
as
if
he
had
always
haunted
the
deutschland
at
a
depth
of
ten
fathoms
below
the
sea
where
in
our
comfortable
he
was
continually
developing
fresh
arts
and
contrivances
and
had
stored
away
in
the
miniature
pantry
and
a
couple
of
drawers
an
amount
of
table
linen
and
plate
next
morning
we
go
up
to
the
surface
again
the
pump
rattles
and
growls
and
we
climb
with
several
hundred
gallons
over
normal
weight
and
with
the
diving
rudders
in
perfect
working
order
to
the
surface
at
about
eleven
fathoms
the
boat
begins
to
lose
her
beautiful
steadiness
this
is
first
noticeable
on
the
gauge
afterwards
by
the
diving
rudders
which
are
harder
to
manipulate
and
on
which
the
boat
often
presses
heavily
the
higher
we
rise
the
more
powerful
these
movements
become
so
there
must
be
a
pretty
rough
sea
up
above
we
rise
now
carefully
up
to
periscope
depth
travel
thus
for
a
while
and
look
around
except
for
a
wide
sweep
of
foaming
waves
nothing
is
to
be
seen
the
weather
suits
me
exactly
for
we
can
diminish
our
watchfulness
accordingly
i
now
decide
to
rise
entirely
to
the
surface
and
fill
one
of
the
tanks
with
compressed
air
till
the
is
sufficiently
free
the
oil
engines
are
started
and
the
ventilation
machine
makes
ready
to
take
in
a
fresh
supply
of
air
hardly
have
we
opened
the
hatch
of
the
however
when
a
rough
watery
greeting
flies
down
into
the
we
are
not
quite
ready
apparently
another
tank
is
blown
out
and
the
set
in
motion
till
the
tanks
are
soon
quite
empty
but
first
another
little
trick
of
seamanship
has
to
be
brought
into
play
in
order
to
rise
still
higher
we
have
to
get
her
broadside
on
again
for
in
this
wild
sea
the
long
heavy
body
of
the
boat
will
not
rise
easily
out
of
the
water
head
on
moving
slowly
we
turn
the
deutschland
broadside
on
to
the
sea
she
rolls
horribly
nearly
shaking
the
soul
out
of
your
body
added
to
this
the
heavy
are
sweeping
continuously
over
the
boat
but
she
obeys
the
diving
rudders
and
slowly
raises
her
nose
out
of
the
water
as
we
rise
entirely
to
the
surface
the
and
periscope
sway
alarmingly
in
the
air
now
comes
another
unpleasant
moment
it
is
necessary
to
bring
the
boat
at
slow
speed
again
on
to
her
proper
course
sheltering
behind
the
thick
windows
of
the
on
which
the
spray
streams
down
incessantly
with
arms
and
legs
wedged
firmly
against
the
sides
i
peer
around
from
old
experience
of
the
sea
i
am
waiting
for
three
particularly
heavy
waves
to
pass
over
which
are
usually
followed
by
a
low
irregular
one
now
the
third
big
wave
has
passed
there
is
a
call
to
the
helmsman
in
the
it
works
the
bow
bores
her
way
slowly
round
and
we
are
back
on
our
old
course
again
without
meeting
any
particularly
heavy
breakers
it
is
still
a
pretty
tough
job
all
the
same
the
storm
if
anything
increases
and
our
journey
proceeds
but
slowly
against
the
heavy
sea
added
to
this
part
of
the
crew
are
seasick
and
the
short
backward
pitches
of
the
boat
are
horrible
but
as
we
proceed
the
long
steady
swell
of
the
atlantic
ocean
becomes
more
marked
the
short
pitching
movements
gradually
cease
and
change
into
a
majestic
swaying
in
the
distance
we
see
two
english
cruisers
returning
from
their
nightly
reconnoitre
we
lie
too
low
for
them
to
notice
us
and
they
disappear
rapidly
in
the
opposite
direction
now
we
are
free
from
the
english
outpost
boats
and
steer
cheerfully
out
into
the
wide
open
spaces
of
the
atlantic
chapter
vii
in
the
atlantic
at
last
we
were
out
in
the
open
the
atlantic
did
not
receive
us
in
a
very
friendly
manner
it
must
be
confessed
we
had
grown
used
to
a
good
deal
in
the
last
few
days
but
i
was
anxious
to
spare
the
nerves
of
the
crew
as
much
as
possible
on
account
of
the
long
journey
that
lay
before
us
i
decided
therefore
to
take
a
more
southerly
direction
in
order
to
try
and
hit
on
fairer
weather
if
possible
unfortunately
we
were
to
be
disappointed
in
this
as
will
be
seen
as
i
glance
through
my
notes
of
those
first
days
in
the
atlantic
i
continually
come
across
remarks
of
this
kind
heavy
sea
stiff
wind
from
the
strength
wind
blowing
up
for
a
storm
heavy
seas
rolling
over
the
whole
boat
and
even
over
the
boat
travelling
almost
continuously
under
water
etc
in
these
few
curt
sentences
lies
the
history
of
the
hard
and
existence
of
men
shut
up
in
the
body
of
a
steel
fish
as
she
made
her
way
untiringly
through
the
wild
tossing
seas
i
know
of
no
better
opportunity
of
praising
the
excellently
construction
and
the
perfect
seafaring
qualities
of
our
deutschland
than
in
calling
to
mind
those
stormy
days
in
the
atlantic
the
elements
certainly
did
not
help
to
make
our
journey
to
america
an
easy
one
the
highest
possible
demands
were
made
on
the
body
and
machinery
of
the
boat
which
had
to
be
continually
at
work
day
after
day
in
order
that
we
might
reach
our
destination
and
here
i
can
not
help
thinking
with
gratitude
of
the
dockyard
and
all
the
men
whose
work
had
contributed
to
help
us
complete
our
journey
by
giving
this
wonderful
piece
of
mechanism
into
our
hands
it
is
easy
to
wax
enthusiastic
over
a
fine
ship
that
delights
the
eye
of
every
onlooker
when
in
harbour
by
her
elegance
and
extracts
the
admiration
of
the
expert
and
the
uninitiated
by
her
rapid
movement
in
smooth
waters
but
the
real
inner
worth
of
a
ship
is
only
to
be
discovered
when
she
has
completed
her
test
on
the
high
seas
then
and
only
then
you
learn
her
best
qualities
and
gain
that
real
confidence
in
her
trustworthiness
and
seafaring
capabilities
when
the
wind
is
blowing
with
a
strength
and
the
sea
has
a
roughness
during
which
you
must
go
head
on
and
this
not
only
for
a
couple
of
hours
but
day
after
day
week
after
week
only
then
can
a
ship
prove
what
she
is
really
worth
this
is
particularly
the
case
with
a
in
war
time
a
merchantman
in
peace
time
has
very
often
a
severe
strain
in
holding
out
but
she
has
always
the
possibility
of
seeking
a
port
of
refuge
or
of
hailing
assistance
at
the
worst
she
can
drift
a
few
days
and
wait
for
smoother
weather
none
of
this
is
possible
with
the
to
the
dangers
of
the
sea
are
added
the
dangers
from
the
enemy
the
cruellest
and
most
pitiless
of
enemies
no
haven
of
refuge
beckons
to
her
and
if
she
were
to
lie
for
a
few
minutes
helpless
and
be
discovered
her
adversaries
who
would
have
helped
a
damaged
steamer
in
distress
would
loosen
the
greedy
bloodhounds
at
her
throat
no
one
is
so
lonely
and
entirely
dependent
on
himself
as
a
captain
if
he
can
not
absolutely
rely
on
his
vessel
then
he
is
lost
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
realised
how
much
we
owed
to
the
germania
docks
and
to
the
chief
engineer
erbach
the
inventor
of
our
boat
it
was
his
plans
combined
with
the
splendid
of
the
submarine
builders
and
shipping
officials
that
had
given
birth
to
this
wonderful
seafaring
vessel
the
boat
which
in
the
winter
of
arose
on
the
slips
at
kiel
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
and
yet
with
the
precision
of
accurate
workmanship
and
which
herr
erbach
taught
me
to
work
and
understand
on
that
memorable
test
voyage
early
in
the
year
was
now
two
months
later
bravely
ploughing
her
way
through
the
stormy
seas
carrying
the
fame
of
german
shipbuilding
across
the
ocean
the
deutschland
had
therefore
been
severely
tested
and
had
come
through
with
flying
colours
for
several
days
the
weather
remained
the
same
with
hurricane
gusts
lashing
up
the
water
into
crashing
mountains
of
waves
all
the
deck
hatches
were
of
necessity
closed
and
at
times
even
the
hatch
which
was
so
well
sheltered
by
the
had
to
be
closed
by
the
at
every
onrush
of
the
waves
it
was
far
from
pleasant
in
the
but
below
deck
where
the
men
were
suffering
badly
from
in
the
close
atmosphere
and
with
the
incessant
rolling
of
the
boat
it
was
a
thousand
times
worse
many
an
experienced
seaman
made
his
first
offering
to
neptune
on
this
occasion
on
the
third
day
it
grew
calmer
the
sea
became
smoother
and
we
were
able
to
open
the
hatches
in
order
to
air
and
dry
the
boat
all
the
men
of
the
off
duty
watch
came
on
deck
and
stretched
themselves
out
in
the
sun
seeking
a
relaxation
worn
out
and
pale
faced
they
appeared
through
the
hatches
and
hardly
had
they
inhaled
the
fresh
sea
breeze
before
their
beloved
pipes
were
lighted
as
we
met
very
few
steamers
on
our
present
course
we
set
to
work
to
give
everything
a
good
drying
all
the
wet
articles
that
could
not
be
dried
down
below
were
brought
up
into
the
air
the
whole
deck
was
packed
with
beds
coverlets
clothes
and
boots
the
clothes
were
fastened
securely
to
the
deck
rails
where
they
fluttered
merrily
in
the
wind
as
if
from
a
washing
line
in
between
them
the
crew
reposed
in
the
strangest
positions
sunning
themselves
like
lizards
in
order
to
increase
the
artificial
ventilation
of
the
rooms
by
means
of
a
draught
of
air
were
hung
up
in
all
the
hatches
with
their
jagged
side
wings
they
looked
rather
like
the
fins
of
a
fish
and
made
the
rounded
green
superstructure
of
the
deutschland
look
like
the
back
of
a
fantastic
monster
whale
we
must
truly
have
presented
a
strange
spectacle
no
one
was
near
however
to
notice
it
we
sighted
one
steamer
only
whose
smoke
appeared
towards
evening
on
the
horizon
and
we
were
easily
able
to
steer
clear
of
her
the
spirits
of
the
crew
were
excellent
as
was
shown
by
the
merry
warbling
of
the
gramophone
from
the
men
room
in
our
likewise
we
enlivened
the
time
with
classical
music
without
which
life
on
a
would
not
bear
thinking
of
moreover
the
monotonous
part
of
our
journey
was
now
to
begin
the
fine
weather
continued
and
we
met
with
few
encounters
i
find
in
my
journal
only
the
following
notes
the
dull
period
of
our
journey
is
commencing
the
boat
is
making
her
way
rolling
slightly
but
bearing
herself
bravely
now
and
then
we
go
out
of
our
way
to
avoid
a
steamer
for
several
days
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
the
gramophones
play
gaily
and
everyone
is
in
the
best
of
humours
on
the
open
sea
we
are
entirely
dependent
on
the
weather
for
our
comfort
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
first
moment
that
we
had
been
able
to
breathe
freely
looking
round
on
all
sides
one
became
almost
incorporated
with
the
everlasting
sameness
of
the
sea
one
day
i
was
standing
on
the
near
me
humke
our
giant
boatswain
squatted
in
the
wooden
scaffolding
of
the
small
central
under
which
we
had
snugly
stored
our
lifeboat
several
lashings
had
been
loosened
during
the
stormy
weather
and
had
to
be
repaired
i
had
stood
there
for
some
time
gazing
westward
my
thoughts
fixed
on
america
our
destination
suddenly
i
took
it
into
my
head
to
broach
the
subject
to
the
sturdy
humke
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
our
voyage
to
america
in
these
days
of
war
what
were
his
impressions
as
to
the
object
of
our
enterprise
the
rascal
grinned
broadly
and
replied
why
to
earn
money
of
course
this
reply
was
a
little
too
summary
for
my
taste
and
i
proceeded
to
explain
to
him
the
real
significance
of
renewing
our
commercial
relations
with
america
in
war
time
in
defiance
of
the
english
blockade
i
then
proceeded
to
make
clear
to
him
exactly
what
the
blockade
meant
he
grasped
the
idea
quickly
and
said
well
now
i
understand
what
the
english
are
after
i
went
further
and
explained
to
him
as
fully
as
i
could
the
meaning
and
exigencies
of
an
effective
blockade
and
was
surprised
at
the
directness
of
his
answer
which
expressed
so
naively
and
with
such
confidence
the
feelings
of
the
people
in
the
simple
language
of
our
well
they
wo
get
and
so
there
ai
no
sense
in
the
english
blockade
as
i
can
see
in
the
meantime
several
of
the
watch
off
duty
had
strolled
up
and
gathered
around
to
listen
there
they
stood
on
the
narrow
deck
of
our
little
submarine
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
a
handful
of
sturdy
unabashed
german
seamen
men
i
said
you
have
heard
now
the
reason
of
our
voyage
but
i
will
tell
you
something
more
my
good
fellows
you
have
no
idea
what
our
cruise
really
signifies
our
gallant
is
much
more
than
a
mere
by
her
means
we
are
bringing
german
goods
to
america
goods
which
the
commercial
jealousy
and
trickiness
of
the
english
have
so
far
prevented
from
reaching
that
country
and
this
not
only
to
injure
germany
exports
but
in
order
to
continue
their
gloomy
fishing
over
yonder
they
do
their
utmost
to
harm
american
industry
and
commerce
that
is
all
a
thing
of
the
past
we
are
seeing
to
that
but
this
is
not
all
the
appearance
of
the
first
trader
is
of
far
deeper
significance
without
even
a
gun
or
torpedo
on
board
the
is
revolutionising
the
entire
methods
of
navigation
overseas
trade
and
international
rights
a
revolution
whose
effects
can
hardly
be
fully
realised
as
yet
how
in
these
days
of
warfare
have
our
armed
fared
we
wanted
to
use
them
as
a
means
to
prevent
this
barbaric
starvation
blockade
which
violates
every
right
of
humanity
and
what
did
the
english
do
they
armed
their
merchantmen
and
shot
down
every
that
approached
them
with
the
object
of
sinking
their
contraband
that
is
what
they
call
themselves
and
what
is
the
result
we
proceed
to
defend
our
skin
and
our
knowing
that
in
every
fishing
vessel
a
murderer
lies
in
wait
by
sinking
the
armed
english
merchant
ships
without
warning
in
order
to
save
ourselves
from
being
rammed
or
fired
on
thereupon
the
english
shriek
for
help
and
by
reason
of
the
existing
conventions
of
sea
warfare
they
win
the
americans
over
to
their
side
for
under
the
present
laws
of
sea
warfare
there
are
no
definite
conditions
laid
down
for
we
wish
to
maintain
friendly
relations
with
the
great
american
people
and
therefore
give
in
the
government
which
rewarded
the
commanders
has
triumphed
apparently
and
the
command
goes
forth
merchant
ships
are
not
to
be
sunk
without
warning
then
our
appears
on
the
scenes
a
and
merchantman
combined
now
merchantmen
must
not
be
sunk
without
warning
and
moreover
the
present
laws
of
sea
warfare
contain
no
definite
conditions
for
a
trader
however
that
must
be
searched
before
sinking
would
be
difficult
to
recognise
if
still
capable
of
submerging
for
then
the
swiftest
is
powerless
the
english
are
caught
in
their
own
trap
for
the
throws
the
whole
interpretation
of
the
rules
of
naval
warfare
on
the
rubbish
heap
the
weapon
that
was
at
first
used
against
us
must
now
speak
in
our
favour
for
the
matter
stands
thus
if
merchantmen
which
can
at
the
same
time
be
may
not
be
sunk
without
warning
then
according
to
the
laws
and
formalities
of
sea
warfare
the
has
rendered
the
english
blockade
futile
for
i
should
like
to
see
the
german
that
would
allow
an
english
patrol
vessel
to
approach
near
enough
to
examine
her
or
supposing
she
is
not
searched
then
in
that
case
merchant
traders
be
sunk
without
warning
english
traders
likewise
and
thus
the
rights
of
warfare
will
be
evenly
balanced
once
more
by
means
of
a
peaceful
unarmed
trader
and
this
my
men
is
where
the
enormous
significance
of
our
lies
thereupon
i
concluded
my
speech
which
was
by
far
the
longest
i
had
ever
made
the
fine
weather
still
continued
the
barometer
remained
steady
the
air
was
dry
and
clear
we
were
gradually
approaching
the
latitudes
in
which
fine
weather
is
the
rule
at
that
time
of
the
year
the
warmth
of
the
sun
rays
began
to
be
felt
and
our
thoughts
turned
towards
refreshment
this
was
provided
us
by
our
a
discovery
of
the
observation
engineer
herr
kiszling
who
otherwise
showed
no
interest
in
anything
but
his
beloved
engines
for
these
he
was
full
of
the
most
touching
and
undeviating
solicitude
often
during
a
heavy
sea
when
all
the
deck
hatches
were
closed
he
would
suddenly
appear
through
the
and
push
hastily
through
into
the
regardless
of
the
exigencies
of
higher
navigation
in
process
there
when
the
officer
on
duty
looked
round
annoyed
at
the
disturbance
there
was
our
sturdy
kiszling
in
his
oldest
oilskins
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
dripping
deck
filled
with
care
for
the
welfare
of
his
engines
trying
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
exhaust
at
the
same
time
he
must
see
if
the
ignition
was
working
properly
if
the
of
his
engines
were
carrying
out
their
functions
and
if
the
explosions
were
quite
regular
he
was
wrapped
up
in
his
beloved
machinery
and
lived
on
its
rhythmical
music
he
noticed
at
once
the
least
irregularity
in
its
working
and
spared
no
trouble
in
getting
to
the
bottom
of
it
it
must
have
been
during
one
of
these
special
tours
of
his
which
were
by
no
means
without
danger
over
the
rounded
slippery
that
the
inspiration
came
to
him
in
brief
he
opened
to
us
the
joyful
possibility
of
the
in
order
to
understand
this
it
is
first
necessary
to
know
the
construction
of
the
upper
part
of
the
deutschland
above
the
cylindrical
hull
on
the
sides
of
which
are
the
submersion
tanks
and
oil
bunkers
rises
the
outer
ship
which
gives
the
vessel
its
real
ship
form
in
this
upper
part
of
the
outer
ship
the
outer
tanks
are
placed
which
when
the
ship
is
laden
are
always
flooded
as
water
and
air
may
penetrate
to
their
interior
by
numerous
openings
holes
and
slits
in
order
that
a
rapid
filling
and
emptying
may
be
achieved
the
outer
tanks
therefore
have
no
connection
with
the
floating
capacity
of
the
boat
they
are
only
the
result
of
the
outer
construction
which
above
water
does
not
follow
the
line
of
the
heavy
hull
and
tanks
in
spite
of
their
relatively
unimportant
functions
the
outer
tanks
must
of
course
be
accessible
from
the
upper
parts
of
the
vessel
this
is
made
possible
by
large
movable
steel
lids
and
by
ladders
on
the
upper
surface
of
the
deck
standing
on
the
therefore
you
have
a
slight
elevation
to
the
upper
deck
surface
the
sea
water
is
continually
rushing
into
these
big
spaces
during
the
voyage
you
have
only
to
climb
in
through
the
opened
plate
lids
to
enjoy
an
absolutely
safe
and
delightful
bath
we
did
not
fail
to
put
this
into
practice
pretty
often
and
found
our
bath
delightful
there
was
only
one
drawback
to
the
business
if
for
instance
you
entered
the
bath
for
the
first
time
soon
after
the
boat
had
risen
to
the
surface
you
found
yourself
not
in
but
in
an
oil
bath
the
bunkers
as
a
matter
of
fact
never
hold
quite
tight
especially
after
a
long
strain
of
travelling
and
so
it
often
happens
that
as
the
boat
rises
to
the
surface
a
curious
layer
of
oil
breaks
through
before
she
reaches
the
top
this
layer
of
oil
is
then
to
be
found
in
the
bath
tank
on
the
lids
of
the
hatches
and
on
deck
inside
the
outer
tanks
it
naturally
remains
on
the
surface
of
the
water
for
there
it
is
not
able
to
mix
and
disperse
quickly
it
generally
remains
there
a
day
sometimes
longer
till
the
oily
water
is
drained
off
and
replaced
by
new
water
again
the
unlucky
man
therefore
who
took
a
bath
during
this
period
emerged
but
little
refreshed
and
with
a
shiny
skin
this
metamorphosis
as
can
be
imagined
caused
great
amusement
among
the
crew
the
fine
weather
now
was
very
favourable
for
submerging
tests
which
were
made
practically
every
day
everything
worked
perfectly
smoothly
and
we
felt
we
could
safely
approach
the
american
coast
and
submerge
within
the
zone
during
one
of
these
submerging
tests
a
wonderful
and
spectacle
was
presented
to
us
i
had
caused
the
boat
to
be
steered
so
that
the
lay
nearly
two
fathoms
under
water
above
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
filled
the
deeps
with
radiant
light
the
water
was
lit
by
many
colours
around
us
the
sea
was
of
brightest
azure
blue
of
an
almost
dazzling
clearness
and
transparent
as
glass
from
the
window
of
the
i
could
see
the
whole
length
of
the
boat
round
which
rose
twinkling
air
bubbles
like
pearls
in
strange
fantastic
distinctness
the
deck
lay
stretched
out
before
me
even
the
furthest
bow
end
was
visible
further
ahead
was
a
twilight
it
seemed
as
if
the
bow
of
the
boat
was
gliding
silently
through
a
wall
of
opal
green
which
opened
up
as
she
moved
and
broke
into
a
dazzling
transparency
of
light
we
were
spellbound
at
this
wonderful
sight
and
the
strangeness
of
the
effect
was
increased
by
the
as
they
floated
through
the
transparent
blue
and
were
caught
in
the
wires
of
the
deck
rails
where
they
shimmered
first
rose
colour
then
pale
yellow
changing
slowly
to
purple
we
were
not
able
at
that
slight
depth
to
observe
any
fish
the
next
day
a
little
incident
occurred
which
afforded
us
much
amusement
though
it
turned
out
rather
differently
from
what
we
had
expected
my
ambition
was
to
follow
in
the
tracks
of
my
comrades
of
the
merchant
service
and
the
navy
who
had
disguised
their
ships
from
the
enemy
by
painting
and
clever
alterations
in
their
outward
structure
during
the
previous
fine
spell
of
weather
we
had
made
a
wonderful
trap
for
steamers
in
order
to
disguise
our
identity
as
a
from
ships
passing
in
the
distance
we
had
rigged
up
a
funnel
out
of
some
which
could
be
fixed
to
the
periscope
with
several
wire
rings
till
it
rose
proudly
in
the
air
the
was
also
provided
with
a
covering
of
to
make
it
resemble
the
upper
middle
deck
of
a
small
trading
vessel
thus
ready
for
all
emergencies
we
travelled
on
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
till
at
in
the
evening
a
steamer
appeared
in
the
distance
to
starboard
we
soon
realised
that
she
must
pass
quite
near
to
us
if
we
continued
on
our
present
course
we
held
aloof
from
her
therefore
and
proceeded
to
try
the
effects
of
our
disguise
the
funnel
is
fixed
up
on
to
the
periscope
and
rises
proudly
erect
in
the
wind
in
order
to
give
it
a
more
realistic
appearance
we
burn
some
cotton
waste
steeped
in
oil
at
its
base
then
the
disappears
under
the
rather
flattering
middle
deck
but
the
disobliging
only
smoulders
horribly
and
refuses
to
give
out
any
smoke
everyone
stands
round
puffing
out
their
cheeks
but
in
vain
till
the
wireless
operator
a
shrewd
berliner
fetches
an
which
produces
a
powerful
glow
in
our
imaginary
boiler
a
cheer
greets
his
handiwork
and
sure
enough
from
the
upper
edge
of
the
funnel
a
delicate
cloud
of
smoke
appears
only
to
vanish
immediately
into
thin
air
laughing
we
decide
to
continue
on
our
way
smokeless
when
up
comes
the
boatswain
humke
with
a
full
of
tar
the
is
again
brought
into
play
and
at
last
our
funnel
can
really
be
said
to
smoke
the
effect
is
certainly
startling
for
the
steamer
suddenly
alters
her
course
and
bears
straight
down
on
us
this
is
not
exactly
our
intention
the
masts
are
immediately
hauled
down
and
everything
cleared
for
submerging
the
middle
deck
disappears
and
with
a
deep
bow
our
beautiful
funnel
falls
together
in
a
heap
no
sooner
does
the
steamer
observe
this
than
she
is
seized
with
wild
amazement
and
horror
she
turns
round
again
abruptly
and
seeks
flight
puffing
out
thick
black
clouds
of
smoke
which
we
eye
not
without
a
certain
feeling
of
envy
once
more
we
raise
our
indefatigable
funnel
the
masts
are
lifted
high
and
while
the
steamer
hastens
away
in
wildest
flight
we
stand
and
laugh
till
the
tears
come
the
situation
was
really
humorous
beyond
description
our
beautiful
disguise
which
was
to
screen
us
from
observation
had
been
the
very
means
of
bringing
the
gallant
steamer
attention
to
bear
upon
us
she
obviously
took
us
for
a
wreck
or
some
ship
in
distress
and
approached
probably
with
the
best
intentions
to
find
herself
face
to
face
with
the
devilish
tricks
of
one
of
those
rascally
submarines
what
must
the
people
on
board
have
thought
when
they
had
recovered
from
the
first
effects
of
the
shock
undoubtedly
they
would
pride
themselves
greatly
on
having
escaped
so
cleverly
this
new
piece
of
piratical
cunning
and
we
should
have
been
so
proud
if
our
disguise
had
only
worked
a
little
better
we
were
not
discouraged
however
but
set
to
work
to
improve
on
our
invention
with
the
result
that
two
days
later
we
steamed
by
an
approaching
vessel
unrecognised
under
our
own
powerful
smoke
chapter
viii
the
inferno
june
comes
gradually
to
an
end
and
with
it
unfortunately
the
fine
weather
a
rising
swell
from
the
and
the
absence
of
the
current
which
we
had
expected
to
help
us
along
indicates
a
storm
centre
in
the
south
diverting
the
course
of
the
gulf
stream
thus
we
travel
on
throughout
another
day
towards
evening
the
atmosphere
becomes
close
and
heavy
and
the
sun
sinks
slowly
in
a
misty
veil
the
sky
grows
threatening
and
overcast
there
is
brilliant
sheet
lightning
while
the
closeness
of
the
atmosphere
announces
the
near
vicinity
of
the
gulf
stream
during
the
night
masses
of
heavy
roll
up
the
wind
rises
on
every
side
and
the
wildness
of
the
running
seas
increases
till
steering
becomes
noticeably
difficult
measurements
record
an
increase
in
the
water
temperature
which
finally
rises
up
to
degrees
fahrenheit
now
we
are
in
the
gulf
stream
whose
periphery
is
marked
in
the
air
above
by
a
fiery
crown
of
heavy
tropical
vivid
sea
phosphorescence
and
strong
atmospherical
disturbances
are
also
accompanying
signs
of
the
presence
of
the
stream
this
is
noticeable
from
our
wireless
apparatus
which
is
strongly
affected
by
the
heavy
electrical
conditions
of
the
atmosphere
hitherto
it
has
kept
us
faithfully
in
touch
with
the
army
bulletins
from
the
nauen
station
the
phosphorescence
of
the
waters
makes
observation
very
difficult
one
eyes
are
blinded
and
observation
made
difficult
by
the
continuous
sparkling
of
the
surface
of
the
sea
in
the
blackness
of
the
night
this
state
of
things
is
far
from
pleasant
for
we
are
now
approaching
a
zone
where
many
steamer
tracks
cross
each
other
and
double
precautions
are
necessary
added
to
this
the
foulness
of
the
weather
increases
heavy
seas
spring
up
and
a
storm
of
hail
beats
down
on
the
deck
over
the
foaming
waves
a
wind
of
strength
to
is
blowing
all
around
over
the
boiling
sea
hang
heavy
black
balls
of
clouds
from
which
a
pale
yellow
light
darts
out
incessantly
regular
broadsides
of
lightning
then
suddenly
all
is
enveloped
in
blackest
night
again
while
at
times
the
whole
boat
and
the
surrounding
water
are
lit
up
by
flashes
of
greenish
light
in
which
every
detail
shows
up
with
startling
distinctness
the
whole
air
is
filled
with
tumultuous
uproar
and
overhead
the
thunder
crashes
continuously
we
are
approaching
the
centre
of
the
storm
the
boat
is
surrounded
by
an
unearthly
it
is
as
if
the
end
of
all
things
had
come
suddenly
the
of
a
big
steamer
rise
up
behind
us
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
we
are
able
to
avoid
her
without
difficulty
like
a
shining
vision
she
disappears
in
the
distance
she
is
a
passenger
steamer
who
judging
by
her
course
has
come
from
the
mediterranean
i
must
confess
we
watched
her
row
of
lights
with
a
feeling
of
envy
till
rain
and
darkness
swallowed
her
up
from
sight
again
the
next
day
the
weather
reaches
its
worst
stage
gusts
of
wind
sweep
all
around
the
air
is
filled
with
continuous
froth
the
water
no
longer
falls
in
drops
but
in
cascades
walls
of
water
pour
down
lashing
our
faces
and
hands
painfully
the
air
is
so
thick
that
one
can
no
longer
see
through
it
in
order
to
observe
anything
ever
so
faintly
a
small
piece
of
glass
has
to
be
held
in
front
of
the
eyes
with
the
result
that
a
little
foaming
torrent
rolls
from
the
pane
on
to
your
sleeves
the
boat
travels
with
extreme
difficulty
in
the
roaring
sea
she
is
tossed
here
and
there
by
the
waves
till
every
joint
creaks
and
groans
sometimes
she
heels
over
so
heavily
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
hold
on
with
one
free
hand
only
to
the
parapet
of
the
it
is
an
inferno
but
this
is
nothing
to
the
hell
down
below
particularly
in
the
engine
room
owing
to
the
heavy
seas
all
the
hatches
are
of
necessity
closed
even
the
hatch
can
only
be
opened
occasionally
two
great
ventilation
machines
are
working
unceasingly
it
is
true
but
the
fresh
air
that
they
draw
from
the
ventilation
shaft
which
is
carefully
protected
from
the
breakers
is
immediately
swallowed
up
by
the
greedy
diesel
engines
these
hungry
ungrateful
monsters
only
give
off
heat
in
return
heavy
overbearing
heat
impregnated
with
horrible
oil
vapour
which
is
then
swept
by
the
ventilators
throughout
all
the
other
compartments
such
ventilation
can
no
longer
be
of
a
refreshing
nature
the
air
in
the
boat
on
this
account
has
become
overwhelmingly
laden
with
moisture
it
is
almost
an
impossibility
to
breathe
and
one
awaits
with
resignation
or
desperate
gaiety
the
moment
when
one
really
will
be
forced
to
join
the
fishes
in
the
body
of
the
ship
every
object
is
covered
in
steaming
water
which
again
evaporates
in
the
heat
till
everything
is
soaked
through
and
streaming
all
the
drawers
and

fast
and
added
to
this
the
wet

from
the
watchers
in

are
spread
out
over
the
whole
boat
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
idea
of
the
state
of
the
temperature
that
then
reigned
in
the
boat
in
the
gulf
stream
the
outside
temperature
was
degrees
fahrenheit
so
extraordinarily
warm
was
the
water
around
us
fresh
air
no
longer
penetrated
and
in
the
the
two
combustion
engines
hammered
on
in
ceaseless
rhythm
a
choking
cloud
of
heat
and
oil
vapour
issued
from
the
engines
and
spread
through
every
part
of
the
boat
the
temperature
rose
gradually
in
these
days
to
degrees
fahrenheit
and
in
such
an
inferno
men
lived
and
worked
groaning
the
naked
watch
rolled
about
in
their
cabins
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
when
one
of
them
was
just
dropping
off
into
a
heavy
stupor
he
would
be
awakened
to
fresh
misery
by
the
perspiration
running
in
drops
from
his
forehead
into
his
eyes
it
was
almost
a
relief
when
the
eight
hours
rest
was
over
and
the
watchmen
were
called
once
more
into
the
or
the
then
the
martyrdom
recommenced
clad
only
in
shirt
and
trousers
the
men
stood
at
their
posts
a
cloth
wrapped
round
their
foreheads
to
keep
the
perspiration
out
of
their
eyes
the
blood
glowed
and
rushed
in
their
temples
fever
was
in
their
veins
it
was
only
by
the
greatest
strength
of
will
that
they
were
able
to
force
their
streaming
bodies
to
perform
their
allotted
duties
and
to
keep
going
during
the
four
hours
watch
but
how
long
could
this
state
of
things
be
expected
to
last
during
these
days
i
kept
no
journal
and
can
only
find
the
following
note
if
the
temperature
rises
any
higher
the
men
in
the
will
not
be
able
to
stand
it
any
longer
they
did
stand
it
however
they
kept
going
like
heroes
doing
their
work
in
spite
of
exhaustion
till
at
last
the
storm
centre
lay
behind
us
the
weather
cleared
up
the
sun
broke
through
the
clouds
and
the
dropping
of
the
sea
made
it
possible
to
open
the
hatches
once
more
then
they
climbed
up
out
of
their
inferno
pale
covered
with
dirt
and
oil
and
rejoiced
in
the
sun
as
if
they
had
never
seen
it
before
chapter
ix
america
while
crossing
the
atlantic
we
had
avoided
approaching
steamers
by
slightly
altering
our
course
we
had
even
risked
being
noticed
on
one
or
two
occasions
but
during
the
last
days
of
our
voyage
we
submerged
directly
a
cloud
of
smoke
appeared
on
the
horizon
on
no
account
must
we
be
observed
when
approaching
the
coast
as
we
had
to
reckon
with
the
presence
of
enemy
warships
on
the
july
we
guessed
by
the
colour
of
the
water
that
we
could
not
be
far
from
our
goal
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
i
conferred
with
my
officers
as
to
the
navigation
of
cape
henry
the
southernmost
of
the
two
headlands
which
form
the
entrance
to
the
roadstead
of
hampton
road
and
chesapeake
bay
my
idea
was
to
await
daybreak
at
about
ten
knots
out
from
the
american
territorial
waters
in
order
to
discover
whether
any
enemy
measures
had
been
taken
if
by
any
chance
news
of
our
voyage
had
leaked
out
we
should
certainly
have
to
reckon
with
such
enemy
influences
krapohl
on
the
other
hand
was
for
getting
in
as
near
the
coast
as
possible
under
cover
of
the
night
and
eyring
was
of
the
same
opinion
both
plans
had
their
fors
and
againsts
and
eventually
i
decided
to
continue
our
way
carefully
in
the
twilight
and
wait
to
see
what
the
weather
conditions
would
be
no
sooner
was
our
decision
made
than
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
sprang
up
which
cleared
our
range
of
vision
considerably
at
the
same
time
however
the
boat
started
rolling
in
a
very
disagreeable
manner
in
the
stiff
choppy
sea
that
had
risen
with
the
breeze
we
decided
therefore
to
follow
the
direction
of
the
lights
on
cape
henry
and
cape
charles
through
the
night
we
proceeded
on
our
course
till
not
long
after
a
pale
light
flashed
out
suddenly
on
the
horizon
then
disappeared
again
this
was
the
glow
of
the
flashlights
on
cape
henry
the
first
greeting
from
america
suddenly
a
white
light
shone
out
in
the
distance
to
starboard
disappeared
and
then
flared
out
again
it
was
immediately
succeeded
by
a
white
light
on
our
port
side
which
however
continued
to
shine
steadily
we
looked
at
each
other
what
the
blazes
did
this
mean
it
looked
uncommonly
like
darkened
warships
making
flashlight
signals
to
each
other
in
any
case
it
meant
a
devilish
sharp
on
our
part
at
submerged
up
to
the
every
man
at
his
station
we
crept
nearer
maintaining
the
closest
observation
our
glasses
boring
their
way
through
the
darkness
it
was
not
long
before
we
discovered
that
the
steady
light
proceeded
from
a
harmless
outgoing
steamer
which
was
already
hurrying
away
at
some
distance
behind
us
soon
after
we
were
able
to
make
out
from
the
place
whence
the
flickering
light
had
appeared
the
outlines
of
the
sail
of
a
schooner
which
like
many
coast
steamers
was
travelling
without
and
only
showing
a
white
light
at
her
stern
from
time
to
time
this
was
what
we
had
taken
for
the
signalling
of
warships
much
relieved
i
let
the
engines
go
full
speed
ahead
and
soon
we
hove
in
full
sight
of
the
steady
flare
from
cape
henry
while
the
quivering
lights
of
cape
charles
grew
clearer
and
clearer
on
the
horizon
now
we
knew
that
we
had
steered
correctly
the
entrance
between
the
two
headlands
lay
before
us
the
lights
were
now
plainly
visible
with
an
indescribable
feeling
in
my
heart
i
greeted
the
flare
from
cape
charles
which
shone
out
in
the
surrounding
darkness
a
silent
but
sure
sign
that
over
yonder
after
our
long
and
dangerous
journey
was
firm
land
again
that
over
yonder
lay
our
goal
mighty
america
we
passed
now
by
the
various
light
buoys
of
the
roadstead
and
the
familiar
ringing
of
the
siren
buoy
near
by
which
i
had
heard
on
former
voyages
assured
my
ears
as
well
as
my
eyes
that
we
were
near
terra
firma
after
we
had
passed
the
bell
buoy
we
rose
fully
to
the
surface
the
lights
of
several
passenger
steamers
were
visible
but
they
did
not
discover
us
as
we
were
travelling
with
darkened
lights
at
last
we
reached
the
territorial
waters
off
cape
henry
this
was
on
the
july
at
once
inside
the
territorial
waters
we
started
our
lights
and
proceeded
steadily
on
our
way
through
the
roadstead
between
the
capes
till
we
made
out
the
red
and
white
of
a
pilot
steamer
ahead
of
us
we
stopped
and
showed
the
customary
blue
light
whereupon
the
pilot
steamer
brought
her
searchlight
to
bear
upon
us
and
not
recognising
the
outlines
of
a
steamer
approached
cautiously
she
held
us
for
some
time
under
her
searchlight
whose
rays
played
continuously
over
the
low
deck
and
of
the
deutschland
the
unexpected
appearance
of
our
boat
seemed
so
to
have
bewildered
the
gallant
captain
that
it
was
some
time
before
he
called
out
to
us
through
the
speaking
trumpet
where
are
you
bound
for
on
our
replying
newport
news
he
asked
the
name
of
our
ship
we
gave
the
name
but
it
was
necessary
to
repeat
it
twice
before
he
grasped
the
real
nature
of
this
strange
visitor
thereupon
there
must
have
been
a
great
sensation
on
board
the
pilot
steamer
then
a
boat
approached
us
swiftly
and
the
pilot
climbed
up
the
rounded
hull
of
the
deutschland
on
to
her
deck
and
greeted
us
with
the
following
hearty
words
i
be
damned
so
here
she
is
then
he
shook
hands
heartily
with
us
again
and
expressed
his
pleasure
at
being
the
first
american
to
welcome
the
deutschland
to
the
land
of
liberty
i
asked
him
immediately
if
he
had
had
any
idea
that
we
were
expected
to
my
surprise
and
delight
i
learnt
that
for
the
last
few
days
a
tug
had
been
awaiting
our
arrival
between
the
capes
we
started
off
therefore
with
our
trusty
pilot
in
search
of
her
in
the
meanwhile
the
incoming
steamers
had
discovered
the
nature
of
this
curious
new
arrival
and
lit
us
up
on
all
sides
with
their
searchlights
thus
our
arrival
in
american
waters
was
rather
in
the
nature
of
a
weird
nocturne
the
search
for
our
was
however
by
no
means
an
easy
matter
in
the
darkness
we
cruised
around
for
some
time
till
at
last
after
two
hours
we
found
her
it
was
the
tug
timmins
under
the
command
of
captain
hinsch
of
the
north
german
lloyd
great
was
his
delight
for
the
gallant
captain
whose
steamer
the
neckar
had
lain
at
baltimore
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
had
been
waiting
nearly
ten
days
for
us
between
the
capes
our
long
delay
had
filled
him
with
distress
as
to
our
possible
fate
now
however
he
was
delighted
to
see
his
protégé
safe
and
sound
before
his
eyes
he
communicated
to
us
thereupon
the
order
to
proceed
to
baltimore
instead
of
newport
news
where
everything
was
already
prepared
for
our
arrival
we
parted
therefore
from
our
honest
pilot
and
travelled
on
accompanied
by
the
timmins
into
chesapeake
bay
after
proudly
hoisting
the
german
flag
which
had
not
fluttered
over
these
waters
since
the
arrival
of
the
eitel
friedrich
in
front
of
hampton
road
in
this
manner
we
entered
the
bay
in
the
grey
morning
light
our
course
became
by
degrees
a
triumphal
procession
all
the
american
and
neutral
steamers
that
met
us
greeted
us
with
prolonged
tootings
from
pipes
and
sirens
one
english
steamer
only
passed
by
us
in
poisonous
silence
while
our
black
white
and
red
flag
fluttered
proudly
in
the
wind
before
her
eyes
captain
hinsch
moreover
in
his
tug
took
devilish
care
that
the
englishman
should
not
by
chance
run
too
close
in
by
the
rudder
and
ram
us
by
mistake
the
gallant
timmins
was
useful
to
us
in
other
ways
our
only
means
of
responding
to
the
greetings
of
the
various
steamers
was
by
driving
the
siren
by
means
of
our
precious
compressed
air
this
would
have
gradually
become
an
expensive
game
and
so
the
timmins
undertook
to
return
thanks
for
us
with
her
hoarse
steam
whistle
the
further
we
advanced
into
the
bay
the
wilder
grew
the
noise
we
rejoiced
from
the
depths
of
our
hearts
at
these
signs
of
sympathy
with
us
and
our
cruise
on
the
part
of
the
americans
towards
four
in
the
afternoon
the
timmins
was
able
to
come
up
alongside
and
handed
up
to
us
a
block
of
ice
a
couple
of
bottles
of
champagne
were
quickly
cooled
and
proudly
we
toasted
the
successful
arrival
of
the
deutschland
in
america
our
one
regret
in
connection
with
this
performance
being
that
our
faithful
hinsch
only
came
in
for
the
corks
which
flew
on
board
the
tug
only
those
who
can
realise
what
it
means
to
have
lived
day
after
day
in
a
temperature
of
degrees
fahrenheit
will
fully
appreciate
the
joy
of
that
first
cool
iced
drink
the
news
of
our
arrival
must
have
spread
with
extraordinary
rapidity
for
to
our
no
small
surprise
hours
before
we
reached
baltimore
boats
came
out
to
meet
us
with
reporters
and
cinematograph
operators
on
board
although
it
was
growing
dusk
we
were
fairly
bombarded
and
we
should
probably
have
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
a
still
greater
stream
of
questions
and
calls
if
the
of
chesapeake
bay
had
not
come
hospitably
to
the
rescue
and
ensured
us
a
little
breathing
space
a
heavy
storm
arose
suddenly
and
the
stream
of
questions
was
quenched
by
a
stream
of
rain
which
fell
refreshingly
down
upon
us
sunburnt
seafarers
meanwhile
through
the
fast
approaching
evening
the
deutschland
accompanied
by
the
faithful
timmins
travelled
on
once
more
silent
and
lonely
towards
her
goal
at
we
drew
in
to
the
baltimore
quarantine
station
and
for
the
first
time
our
anchor
struck
american
ground
the
u
deutschland
had
arrived
chapter
x
baltimore
our
first
glance
the
following
morning
fell
on
the
stout
little
timmins
who
had
moored
up
alongside
there
she
lay
the
faithful
soul
and
mounted
guard
over
us
shortly
after
at
five
the
doctor
of
the
quarantine
station
came
along
i
gave
him
up
our
health
certificate
which
had
been
carefully
made
out
for
us
on
june
by
william
thomas
fee
the
american
consul
at
bremen
the
doctor
then
examined
the
boat
and
after
mustering
the
crew
set
us
free
and
ended
up
by
giving
three
cheers
for
the
deutschland
and
her
crew
the
anchor
was
hauled
up
and
we
travelled
under
the
guidance
of
timmins
towards
our
wharf
and
at
locust
point
never
before
surely
has
a
boat
travelled
under
such
conditions
as
now
fell
to
our
lot
guarded
jealously
by
our
timmins
and
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
boats
specially
hired
by
the
various
film
companies
on
each
boat
five
or
six
men
stood
ready
with
their
cameras
and
tried
to
rouse
us
to
suitable
cinematograph
poses
by
chaffing
remarks
show
your
face
cap
turn
your
head
round
wave
your
hand
these
and
similar
cries
arose
on
every
side
while
the
fellows
pushed
and
shoved
and
shouted
like
madmen
i
stood
in
the
and
looked
to
right
and
left
waved
both
hands
and
had
no
need
to
force
a
laugh
for
the
wild
movements
of
the
film
hunters
were
indescribably
funny
thus
in
the
merriest
of
moods
we
reached
our
at
locust
point
here
our
captain
hinsch
had
spent
weeks
in
making
all
ready
for
us
the
deutschland
found
such
a
safe
harbour
and
was
so
protected
by
booms
and
netting
from
the
approach
of
any
strange
vessel
that
according
to
all
human
calculations
nothing
could
possibly
happen
to
her
we
lay
inside
a
wooden
pier
built
out
into
the
stream
under
cover
of
a
great
shed
in
which
our
destined
cargo
was
already
piled
up
in
waiting
for
us
the
situation
lay
so
apart
that
the
connection
of
the
pier
with
the
nearest
good
road
must
be
first
explained
the
whole
position
was
shut
off
from
the
land
by
a
big
trench
and
a
steel
wire
fencing
in
the
stream
itself
the
deutschland
was
protected
by
the
pier
and
the
north
german
lloyd
steamer
neckar
which
had
lain
at
baltimore
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
now
served
us
as
a
place
of
residence
from
which
we
could
watch
over
our
boat
on
the
other
side
surrounding
the
deutschland
a
regular
network
of
heavy
beams
stretched
out
with
thick
nets
which
reached
to
the
bottom
of
the
water
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
even
for
a
diver
to
get
at
the
boat
moreover
day
and
night
guarded
the
spot
among
them
the
timmins
which
lit
up
the
surrounding
neighbourhood
with
her
little
searchlight
all
night
long
many
amusing
incidents
occurred
in
connection
with
this
in
order
that
the
unloading
and
reloading
of
the
deutschland
should
proceed
without
observation
yet
another
high
palisading
had
been
erected
round
the
warehouse
sheds
which
prohibited
the
least
view
of
the
ship
and
loading
place
the
only
spot
from
which
a
glimpse
of
the
wonderful
boat
even
at
some
distance
could
be
obtained
was
from
a
which
was
anchored
in
the
stream
and
which
was
immediately
besieged
by
newspaper
reporters
as
a
place
of
observation
here
they
nested
holding
us
well
in
sight
and
keeping
watch
with
the
utmost
regularity
day
and
night
two
men
sat
there
continuously
perched
high
on
the
slender
scaffolding
of
the
in
sacrificial
practice
of
their
calling
we
were
also
at
our
posts
and
at
night
during
the
change
of
watch
yonder
on
the
the
searchlight
operator
of
the
timmins
had
his
bit
of
fun
by
enveloping
the
reporters
in
beams
of
light
and
thus
politely
lightening
their
darkness
and
assisting
them
in
their
difficult
task
as
they
climbed
cautiously
down
from
the
scaffolding
they
were
each
singled
out
by
a
beam
of
light
one
after
the
other
like
spiders
with
a
pocket
lamp
for
the
rest
the
gallant
captain
hinsch
had
seen
to
everything
from
our
reception
and
safe
guidance
down
to
the
provision
for
our
wants
on
board
the
neckar
from
this
steamer
only
a
favoured
few
were
allowed
a
sight
of
the
deutschland
and
that
only
from
the
outside
a
visit
to
the
boat
was
strictly
forbidden
for
her
own
sake
we
should
have
been
glad
and
proud
to
show
our
wonderful
boat
to
everyone
for
fear
however
of
the
risk
of
an
attack
which
might
easily
arise
on
the
german
trader
if
everyone
had
been
allowed
an
inspection
we
dared
not
depart
from
our
instructions
in
this
respect
and
thus
hundreds
of
americans
who
had
come
great
distances
even
from
the
west
in
their
motorcars
were
obliged
much
to
our
regret
to
depart
without
having
achieved
their
object
the
cinematograph
companies
however
did
not
go
away
entirely
i
granted
their
wish
to
immortalise
the
crew
of
the
deutschland
on
her
first
touching
on
american
soil
and
all
of
us
were
photographed
in
a
group
on
deck
my
first
journey
through
the
town
resembled
a
triumphal
entry
the
car
was
obliged
to
pull
up
continually
everyone
tried
to
shake
me
by
the
hand
and
pour
out
their
congratulations
during
the
first
few
days
in
baltimore
i
became
simply
an
obstruction
to
the
traffic
in
this
manner
we
proceeded
slowly
to
the
north
german
lloyd
agency
which
was
surrounded
by
crowds
of
people
the
next
step
was
to
go
through
the
necessary
custom
house
formalities
i
made
my
way
therefore
to
the
customs
house
authorities
and
got
through
the
usual
examination
i
was
received
on
all
sides
in
the
most
hearty
and
friendly
manner
then
i
went
back
to
the
agency
and
devoted
all
my
abilities
to
the
press
i
stood
in
the
office
of
the
north
german
lloyd
agency
behind
the
barrier
of
the
booking
bureau
on
the
other
side
of
which
a
huge
crowd
was
pressing
i
was
quite
alone
and
had
to
hold
my
own
against
hundreds
of
men
and
women
who
each
had
some
particular
question
to
put
from
the
most
insignificant
personalities
up
to
the
highest
region
of
politics
one
lady
called
out
do
tell
me
captain
what
it
is
like
in
a
submarine
another
asked
with
deep
sympathy
i
say
is
it
true
that
in
germany
the
babies
are
starving
for
want
of
milk
while
a
gentleman
of
extremely
appearance
showed
his
interest
by
the
question
say
captain
what
do
you
live
on
i
was
also
frequently
asked
what
about
the
emperor
message
you
brought
over
for
mr
wilson
to
which
i
could
give
as
little
information
as
to
the
question
when
do
you
think
of
leaving
baltimore
again
to
all
these
and
a
hundred
other
questions
i
was
obliged
to
make
answer
i
stood
there
like
a
breakwater
the
tide
swirling
round
me
creeping
higher
and
higher
till
my
conscious
self
was
almost
swallowed
up
only
on
the
following
day
to
reappear
in
bits
in
endless
press
notices
all
over
the
world
meanwhile
my
body
proceeded
somewhat
fatigued
to
the
german
club
where
we
had
been
invited
to
celebrate
our
arrival
at
a
purely
german
gathering
during
which
our
thoughts
flew
back
with
pride
and
love
to
the
struggling
fatherland
over
yonder
the
following
days
were
in
the
nature
of
a
continuous
festivity
for
us
only
those
who
know
american
hospitality
and
enthusiasm
can
form
any
idea
of
the
cordiality
that
greeted
us
on
all
sides
the
people
went
quite
mad
over
us
and
it
did
one
heart
good
to
see
what
genuine
sympathy
all
the
americans
showed
over
our
journey
and
safe
arrival
and
to
hear
how
warmly
they
expressed
their
feelings
on
the
subject
everywhere
we
went
we
were
enthusiastically
received
they
shook
us
by
the
hand
sang
the
watch
on
the
rhine
and
expressed
their
appreciation
by
eloquent
ovations
invitations
rained
down
on
officers
and
men
parties
and
feasts
were
held
in
our
honour
and
on
one
occasion
when
my
two
officers
of
the
watch
who
were
walking
with
a
friend
in
some
public
gardens
became
recognised
the
concert
music
suddenly
stopped
a
searchlight
was
flashed
on
to
them
and
amidst
general
acclamation
the
band
struck
up
the
watch
on
the
rhine
and
the
american
national
anthem
while
the
general
public
of
all
ranks
and
classes
thus
showed
their
appreciation
the
american
government
were
dealing
with
the
official
side
of
the
question
as
to
whether
our
boat
was
to
be
regarded
as
a
merchantman
pure
and
simple
or
whether
in
accordance
with
the
urgent
protests
of
the
english
and
french
ambassadors
she
would
in
her
character
of
submarine
alone
be
regarded
as
a
war
vessel
on
the
july
a
government
commission
consisting
of
three
american
marine
officers
came
from
washington
to
inspect
our
deutschland
thoroughly
as
there
was
no
sign
of
armament
or
arrangements
for
bringing
any
such
on
board
we
were
quite
ready
to
show
them
over
everything
after
a
three
hours
inspection
during
which
every
compartment
and
corner
were
examined
and
which
cost
the
commission
officers
many
a
drop
of
perspiration
during
the
crawling
around
in
the
glowing
heat
of
the
boat
the
commission
confirmed
the
purely
mercantile
character
of
the
u
deutschland
they
were
at
no
pains
to
conceal
their
admiration
for
the
ingenious
construction
of
the
whole
boat
and
expressed
particularly
the
staggering
impression
of
bewilderment
which
the
complicated
mechanism
of
all
the
works
had
made
upon
them
in
honour
of
the
whole
crew
a
german
festival
was
started
by
the
many
of
baltimore
in
aid
of
the
red
cross
this
was
celebrated
in
canstätter
park
a
great
public
park
near
baltimore
with
shooting
galleries
sausage
stalls
open
stage
dancing
ground
and
other
forms
of
amusement
in
the
open
air
i
must
say
our
men
stood
this
test
on
land
as
well
as
they
had
that
on
the
water
they
acquitted
themselves
bravely
throughout
this
homage
and
were
not
awkward
when
dancing
began
they
chose
their
partners
without
hesitation
and
a
couple
of
smart
fellows
even
danced
with
the
ladies
who
had
got
up
the
fête
as
if
they
had
been
used
to
it
all
their
lives
on
the
july
the
deutschland
received
a
visit
from
the
german
ambassador
count
bernstorff
who
had
come
with
several
gentlemen
from
the
summer
residence
of
the
embassy
to
baltimore
we
showed
them
over
our
gallant
boat
with
pride
although
an
inspection
in
the
midst
of
the
embarkation
of
her
cargo
and
in
the
intense
heat
was
by
no
means
an
entirely
delightful
one
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
there
was
an
official
dinner
given
by
the
mayor
of
baltimore
in
honour
of
the
visit
of
the
german
embassy
preceded
by
a
small
luncheon
party
at
the
germania
club
house
the
dinner
given
by
the
mayor
a
most
amiable
man
was
of
an
exclusively
political
character
and
was
only
attended
by
politicians
and
officials
there
was
a
long
succession
of
excellent
courses
and
wines
and
according
to
american
custom
with
the
appearance
of
the
endless
drinks
at
the
close
of
it
many
speeches
were
made
in
which
the
arrival
of
the
deutschland
in
america
and
its
importance
in
connection
with
baltimore
and
friendship
were
celebrated
then
the
municipal
band
appeared
in
the
town
gardens
and
played
the
watch
on
the
rhine
and
the
american
hymn
while
the
german
and
american
flags
were
crossed
this
was
a
pleasing
symbol
of
friendship
and
understanding
between
the
two
peoples
whose
interests
both
lay
in
the
freedom
of
the
seas
while
all
these
festivities
were
in
progress
which
took
up
nearly
all
our
evenings
the
unloading
of
our
boat
had
been
completed
and
the
embarkation
begun
this
was
quite
a
special
chapter
in
itself
and
hilken
the
representatives
of
the
north
german
lloyd
at
baltimore
had
done
everything
in
their
power
to
make
this
extremely
delicate
part
of
our
task
as
easy
and
safe
as
possible
for
us
they
had
not
only
acquired
on
the
quiet
all
the
goods
for
our
return
cargo
and
had
them
taken
to
the
sheds
ready
for
loading
it
was
a
jolly
fine
stock
too
and
many
who
saw
it
wondered
how
on
earth
such
a
quantity
of
goods
could
ever
be
stored
away
on
a
but
they
had
even
procured
the
necessary
and
specially
adapted
loading
and
stocking
personnel
gangs
of
lightermen
and
dockers
much
of
the
work
on
the
boat
and
wharf
was
undertaken
by
niggers
who
were
closely
watched
for
the
least
sign
of
observation
powers
or
other
dangerous
faculties
moreover
the
niggers
were
closely
searched
each
time
before
they
commenced
work
and
obliged
to
strip
entirely
in
order
to
secure
the
boat
against
any
attack
the
unloading
was
completed
without
any
further
difficulties
the
embarkation
however
was
a
more
difficult
matter
for
this
careful
calculations
on
the
part
of
our
expert
submarine
embarkation
specialist
shipping
engineer
prusse
of
the
germania
dock
were
first
necessary
every
pound
of
the
varying
weights
and
sizes
of
the
goods
to
be
loaded
had
to
be
reckoned
up
before
being
stowed
in
the
space
particularly
appointed
for
them
in
order
to
prevent
an
unequal
trimming
of
the
boat
an
absolutely
exact
storing
was
necessary
inasmuch
as
the
whole
loading
space
was
very
limited
and
every
box
and
sack
must
be
held
firmly
in
its
position
otherwise
the
most
unpleasant
occurrences
might
arise
either
during
a
storm
by
sudden
submersions
at
a
steep
angle
or
any
other
incidents
which
might
seriously
impede
our
navigation
an
embarkation
of
this
kind
therefore
was
bound
to
be
a
lengthy
affair
the
whole
cargo
sacks
and
boxes
had
to
be
carried
by
hand
by
the
niggers
through
the
narrow
hatchways
the
goods
had
first
to
be
weighed
piece
by
piece
each
separately
the
taking
notes
meanwhile
and
calling
out
the
number
of
weights
which
were
then
carefully
indexed
this
indexing
was
part
of
a
specially
plan
according
to
which
the
whole
packing
was
exactly
carried
out
and
the
accuracy
of
this
plan
was
then
tested
by
a
submersion
and
test
for
which
our
had
just
sufficient
depth
of
water
for
this
test
the
crew
all
took
up
their
submerging
stations
the
submersion
tanks
were
slowly
opened
and
the
boat
flooded
with
just
sufficient
water
to
make
her
float
the
hatch
still
remaining
above
the
surface
in
this
way
the
hull
of
the
boat
is
made
to
oscillate
by
means
of
the
different
water
loads
of
the
two
trimming
tanks
and
from
this
one
can
judge
if
the
balance
of
the
boat
is
properly
adjusted
if
after
this
it
is
found
necessary
to
alter
the
weights
the
cargo
is
moved
accordingly
one
last
submerging
and
trimming
test
must
then
follow
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
loading
of
the
whole
boat
agrees
in
every
detail
thus
her
two
thousand
tons
are
brought
into
perfect
adjustment
in
the
fluctuating
displacement
of
the
water
chapter
xi
the
departure
from
baltimore
above
the
description
of
our
return
voyage
i
should
like
to
put
as
a
motto
what
the
london
of
july
wrote
regarding
the
attitude
of
the
english
government
towards
the
deutschland
the
in
view
of
her
peculiar
qualities
will
be
considered
as
a
war
vessel
and
be
treated
as
such
the
warships
of
the
allies
will
therefore
make
every
effort
to
discover
the
boat
outside
american
territorial
waters
and
to
sink
her
without
warning
thus
ran
a
cablegram
which
reached
america
from
london
on
the
july
thus
we
ourselves
read
it
in
a
copy
of
the
which
was
sent
to
us
at
the
end
of
july
there
was
at
least
one
advantage
that
we
knew
exactly
what
we
had
to
expect
never
has
the
english
point
of
view
been
so
displayed
in
all
its
brutality
we
had
no
torpedo
tubes
no
guns
on
board
not
the
smallest
means
of
attack
we
had
not
even
weapons
of
defence
which
are
always
allowed
on
every
english
merchant
ship
the
most
powerful
of
the
neutral
states
had
moreover
openly
recognised
the
deutschland
as
a
mere
trading
vessel
and
yet
we
were
to
be
sunk
without
warning
we
knew
therefore
what
lay
before
us
it
was
already
known
that
eight
enemy
warships
with
patrol
boats
and
nets
were
waiting
in
front
of
chesapeake
bay
in
order
to
attack
us
directly
we
quitted
american
territorial
waters
and
to
blow
us
up
like
blind
fish
with
mines
foresight
was
therefore
urgently
impelled
on
us
and
our
only
course
was
with
true
craftiness
to
slip
through
somehow
we
remembered
moreover
how
we
had
already
once
succeeded
in
getting
the
best
of
the
english
and
french
efforts
our
running
of
the
english
blockade
in
europe
had
certainly
been
by
no
means
a
smooth
pleasure
trip
nothing
had
caused
us
greater
amusement
than
the
news
of
the
delightful
announcement
made
by
captain
gaunt
of
the
english
consulate
in
new
york
when
the
first
rumour
was
heard
of
the
voyage
of
a
to
america
his
reassuring
words
to
the
english
public
were
it
is
impossible
to
send
a
to
america
and
even
if
the
germans
did
send
one
we
should
soon
catch
her
a
big
submarine
leaves
a
track
of
oil
and
machine
dirt
on
the
surface
of
the
waters
in
her
wake
our
fast
cruisers
would
be
able
to
follow
these
tracks
and
catch
the
boat
for
a
dead
certainty
captain
gaunt
is
the
expert
on
affairs
of
navigation
at
the
consulate
and
ought
to
know
all
we
had
to
do
therefore
was
to
see
to
it
that
their
second
catch
was
as
much
of
a
dead
certainty
as
the
first
at
last
the
of
august
arrived
we
had
taken
a
hearty
leave
everywhere
completed
all
formalities
with
the
authorities
and
were
ready
for
sea
and
for
our
rendezvous
with
the
gentlemen
in
front
of
the
bay
our
departure
was
delayed
as
we
were
obliged
to
wait
for
the
high
tide
in
order
to
get
from
the
patapsco
river
on
which
baltimore
is
situated
across
the
intervening
muddy
bar
out
into
chesapeake
bay
the
water
rose
very
slowly
during
the
day
as
a
north
wind
was
blowing
and
prevented
the
tide
in
the
long
inlet
from
rising
up
quite
as
far
as
baltimore
we
waited
excitedly
for
the
rising
of
the
water
and
at
last
at
five
in
the
afternoon
the
moment
arrived
the
ropes
were
cast
off
the
closely
packed
attendant
boats
made
way
and
the
deutschland
pushed
majestically
off
from
the
pier
into
the
fairway
the
tug
timmins
ran
alongside
of
us
like
a
faithful
snarling
at
the
many
big
and
small
boats
full
of
reporters
and
cinema
people
if
they
approached
too
closely
there
was
nothing
to
fear
the
harbour
police
boat
from
baltimore
had
been
very
kindly
lent
us
and
the
customs
boat
from
maryland
had
received
instructions
to
accompany
us
as
far
as
the
boundary
line
of
their
beat
permitted
hundreds
of
people
stood
on
the
banks
of
the
patapsco
river
waving
and
cheering
us
incessantly
as
we
departed
and
in
the
harbour
all
the
tugs
hooted
with
the
full
blast
of
their
sirens
and
hooters
while
the
steamers
dipped
their
flags
and
tooted
it
was
an
indescribable
uproar
we
knew
as
we
travelled
on
that
the
thoughts
and
blessings
of
countless
hearts
throughout
mighty
america
accompanied
us
and
anxiously
awaited
the
moment
which
should
bring
them
the
certainty
of
our
lucky
escape
out
yonder
as
soon
as
we
got
into
the
fairway
with
the
engines
going
at
full
speed
our
attendants
gradually
fell
behind
even
timmins
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
up
with
us
we
noticed
with
pleasure
how
slowly
all
the
american
boats
travelled
the
cheers
grew
weaker
and
weaker
the
number
of
boats
ever
smaller
and
at
last
only
the
customs
cutter
remained
when
towards
seven
she
also
dropped
off
we
should
have
been
alone
with
timmins
but
for
one
uncanny
follower
who
was
not
so
easy
to
shake
off
she
was
a
smart
grey
boat
with
pointed
nose
and
flat
short
stern
a
regular
racing
boat
which
so
rumour
said
had
an
and
could
do
her
knots
she
appeared
to
have
been
hired
during
the
last
ten
days
by
a
man
who
paid
the
round
sum
of
dollars
a
day
by
which
it
may
be
gathered
how
highly
he
valued
this
chance
of
a
bit
of
sport
in
running
a
race
with
the
by
a
fairly
roughish
sea
had
risen
the
lights
of
the
racing
boat
dropped
more
and
more
behind
and
at
grey
dawn
the
following
morning
the
sea
was
empty
the
racer
had
turned
back
home
in
her
place
however
a
whole
lot
of
fishing
trawlers
appeared
ahead
of
us
in
the
dim
morning
light
which
made
us
fear
that
even
here
in
neutral
waters
we
might
run
into
a
regular
trap
cheers
and
from
the
vessels
soon
showed
us
our
happy
mistake
they
were
a
party
of
american
press
representatives
who
together
with
a
number
of
admirers
and
friends
of
the
deutschland
had
refused
to
miss
the
opportunity
afforded
by
a
night
voyage
of
giving
our
boat
a
farewell
greeting
at
a
distance
of
some
fifty
miles
from
baltimore
one
steamer
after
the
other
glided
by
and
the
next
morning
by
six
we
were
in
sufficiently
free
water
to
make
our
first
submerging
test
i
wanted
to
get
the
boat
and
crew
firmly
in
hand
again
after
our
prolonged
stay
on
land
purely
on
account
of
the
dead
certainty
of
that
catch
we
therefore
made
our
first
trial
and
everything
went
swimmingly
the
timmins
stood
by
and
captain
hinsch
told
me
later
that
it
was
a
marvellous
sight
as
the
deutschland
dived
in
perfect
silence
only
to
reappear
again
a
few
minutes
later
like
a
flash
her
bow
foaming
above
the
water
the
submersion
worked
perfectly
likewise
after
this
in
order
to
see
if
everything
was
in
working
order
i
gave
the
command
for
the
boat
to
come
to
rest
on
the
bottom
at
a
spot
which
according
to
the
map
should
have
had
a
depth
of
fathoms
once
more
all
is
still
the
daylight
fades
the
singing
and
seething
of
the
submersion
valves
sounds
in
our
ears
the
gauge
in
the
registers
fathoms
fathoms
the
power
is
lessened
fathoms
appears
and
i
await
the
gentle
impact
with
which
the
boat
shall
touch
on
the
ground
nothing
of
the
kind
happens
instead
of
this
the
hand
moves
round
on
its
dial
to
fathoms
i
tap
my
finger
on
the
glass
quite
all
right
the
hand
is
just
turning
to
what
in
the
name
of
fortune
the
matter
i
think
to
myself
and
take
up
the
map
yes
fathoms
are
marked
there
and
we
had
taken
exact
bearings
up
above
nevertheless
we
continue
to
sink
fathoms
are
registered
on
the
dial
plate
this
is
too
absurd
i
call
down
to
the
and
receive
the
comforting
reply
that
on
their
big
depth
gauge
also
fathoms
have
been
registered
and
passed
our
gauges
coincide
therefore
this
however
does
not
prevent
the
boat
from
sinking
the
men
in
the
look
at
each
other
it
is
a
ridiculous
situation
to
be
sinking
in
this
confounded
silence
into
the
unknown
and
not
to
be
able
to
see
anything
but
the
everlasting
backward
jerking
of
that
treacherous
hand
on
the
white
dial
in
the
it
is
no
different
i
glance
distractedly
backwards
and
forwards
from
the
map
to
the
gauge
meanwhile
the
boat
sinks
deeper
and
deeper
fathoms
have
gone
by
the
hand
is
moving
towards
i
am
just
thinking
that
the
deeps
of
chesapeake
bay
must
come
to
an
end
somewhere
and
that
we
can
hardly
be
sinking
into
groundlessness
when
suddenly
without
the
least
shock
the
boat
comes
to
a
halt
at
a
depth
of
fathoms
i
scrambled
down
to
the
and
took
counsel
with
klees
and
the
two
officers
of
the
watch
it
could
only
be
that
we
had
struck
a
hole
which
was
not
marked
on
the
map
well
this
was
nothing
serious
after
all
whether
we
had
to
rise
from
or
fathoms
was
quite
immaterial
i
was
just
about
to
give
the
order
to
rise
to
the
surface
when
my
glance
fell
on
the
which
with
its
slowly
jerking
black
and
white
disc
hangs
usually
so
serenely
in
its
case
which
is
lit
up
from
the
inside
i
fell
back
in
surprise
what
on
earth
had
come
over
it
the
disc
of
the
compass
had
gone
quite
mad
and
was
turning
round
and
round
with
short
jerky
movements
the
affair
began
to
grow
distinctly
uncomfortable
considering
that
our
are
about
the
most
reliable
of
any
in
the
whole
world
and
as
at
a
depth
of
fathoms
in
chesapeake
bay
the
earth
could
hardly
be
revolving
round
us
there
was
only
one
conclusion
to
be
drawn
and
that
a
confoundedly
unpleasant
one
we
must
be
turning
round
and
round
in
our
hole
for
what
reason
the
devil
only
knew
i
immediately
gave
orders
for
the
pumps
to
be
started
with
the
result
that
they
started
rattling
but
with
a
more
clanking
empty
noise
so
to
speak
than
usual
they
did
not
help
us
in
the
least
we
remained
sticking
in
the
mud
exactly
as
we
were
before
this
was
the
last
straw
and
i
must
confess
our
confidence
began
to
waver
somewhat
in
the
meantime
we
had
sunk
a
little
deeper
according
to
the
depth
gauge
while
on
the
other
hand
the
rolling
had
ceased
and
we
lay
perfectly
still
once
more
i
gave
energetic
orders
to
rise
immediately
to
the
surface
the
pumps
started
rattling
and
ran
empty
again
that
was
no
good
therefore
the
situation
must
be
carefully
thought
out
otherwise
we
should
be
lying
in
the
same
place
till
morning
after
a
lot
of
trouble
the
engineer
klees
succeeded
in
getting
the
pumps
into
working
order
again
with
a
deep
humming
sound
they
started
pressing
the
water
out
of
the
tanks
they
were
working
as
if
transfixed
our
eyes
sought
the
hand
of
the
depth
gauge
hurrah
we
were
coming
free
we
were
rising
the
hand
was
pointing
to
fathoms
could
i
trust
my
eyes
what
the
devil
was
that
again
the
gauge
suddenly
pointed
to
fathoms
then
on
again
to
fathoms
and
back
to
once
more
the
affair
was
now
growing
critical
we
looked
at
each
other
absolutely
at
the
end
of
our
resources
not
knowing
what
was
wrong
with
the
boat
or
with
ourselves
nor
even
at
what
depth
we
were
and
now
even
the
depth
gauges
had
gone
mad
in
order
to
understand
what
this
means
it
must
be
clearly
realised
that
in
a
submerged
boat
nothing
can
be
known
or
seen
except
by
means
of
the
hands
of
the
depth
gauge
if
that
once
ceases
to
fulfil
its
functions
correctly
then
you
are
absolutely
at
sea
the
situation
had
therefore
grown
very
serious
nevertheless
an
iron
calm
reigned
in
the
boat
we
had
the
consolation
that
in
the
utmost
emergency
we
could
use
our
compressed
air
which
could
not
fail
to
bring
us
to
the
surface
even
if
the
pumps
failed
us
there
was
however
no
need
to
resort
to
this
klees
who
had
been
lost
in
thought
suddenly
gripped
hold
of
one
of
the
valves
a
hissing
noise
of
compressed
air
the
depth
gauge
pointed
wildly
to
fathoms
then
sprang
back
to
again
then
the
coating
of
slime
which
had
stopped
up
the
spouts
of
the
gauge
was
blown
away
by
a
little
of
the
compressed
air
the
mouths
of
the
pumps
were
also
cleared
by
means
of
the
compressed
air
of
all
the
mud
and
slime
which
had
worked
in
during
our
wild
circular
movements
then
the
pumps
commenced
humming
in
their
usual
tones
and
the
deutschland
rose
obediently
to
the
surface
we
had
been
however
one
hour
and
a
half
under
water
captain
hinsch
in
the
timmins
came
alongside
much
relieved
he
had
been
unable
to
understand
the
meaning
of
our
long
submersion
and
had
grown
extremely
anxious
we
must
apparently
have
got
into
some
kind
of
pit
where
the
sand
was
being
ground
and
where
owing
to
our
circular
movements
we
dug
our
way
gradually
into
the
slime
and
mud
i
then
posted
the
timmins
at
a
distance
of
two
miles
away
for
an
observation
of
a
last
important
submersion
test
our
aim
was
without
advancing
to
rise
so
that
the
periscope
appeared
above
water
which
was
by
no
means
an
easy
matter
it
is
naturally
much
easier
to
get
up
to
a
certain
position
by
utilising
the
dynamical
lift
given
by
the
diving
rudders
but
in
doing
this
the
periscope
makes
a
little
track
of
foam
through
the
sea
which
might
under
certain
conditions
prove
treacherous
we
tried
therefore
to
lift
ourselves
from
a
greater
depth
by
oscillating
up
to
a
certain
height
and
by
alternately
emptying
and
filling
the
tanks
at
that
depth
to
reach
a
floating
position
in
which
only
our
periscope
should
appear
just
above
the
water
and
that
in
a
vertical
direction
the
experiment
succeeded
we
were
able
to
stretch
out
our
periscope
feelers
so
that
the
timmins
who
knew
roughly
our
vicinity
did
not
notice
us
before
our
appeared
above
the
water
i
now
felt
certain
that
we
were
prepared
for
all
possibilities
and
could
risk
breaking
through
unobserved
we
continued
therefore
calmly
on
our
way
with
timmins
and
regulated
our
course
so
that
we
reached
the
exit
between
the
capes
just
after
darkness
had
set
in
chapter
xii
running
the
blockade
night
had
set
in
as
we
approached
the
danger
zone
in
front
of
us
sparkled
the
steady
fire
from
cape
henry
while
astern
cape
charles
threw
out
her
lights
at
short
intervals
through
the
darkness
with
these
as
our
bearings
we
went
on
calmly
to
face
the
decision
suddenly
two
searchlights
flashed
out
over
the
water
to
starboard
the
accursed
rays
passed
quick
as
lightning
over
the
dark
waves
i
counted
several
seconds
mechanically
then
the
full
glare
of
the
searchlight
struck
us
in
the
eye
it
was
already
too
late
to
submerge
and
the
treacherous
light
held
fast
on
to
the
deutschland
a
rapid
glance
passed
between
the
two
of
us
in
the
tower
our
features
showed
up
distinctly
in
the
beautiful
free
illumination
then
we
saw
that
the
rays
of
the
searchlight
after
they
had
made
sure
of
us
rose
twice
high
in
the
sky
and
suddenly
disappeared
as
our
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
darkness
again
we
discovered
two
black
vessels
to
starboard
which
looked
like
fishing
trawlers
the
cursed
gang
murmured
krapohl
at
my
side
now
they
have
betrayed
us
and
he
was
right
unfortunately
for
over
yonder
on
the
coast
a
gigantic
searchlight
flashed
high
in
the
sky
obviously
as
a
signal
to
the
english
cruisers
waiting
outside
now
was
the
moment
i
thought
make
ready
to
submerge
my
orders
rang
out
ten
fathoms
down
at
the
same
time
we
took
a
course
to
the
south
half
an
hour
later
we
rose
to
the
surface
again
as
i
wanted
to
take
my
bearings
once
more
hardly
had
i
taken
a
glance
round
however
than
we
were
obliged
to
avoid
immediate
danger
by
submerging
again
for
close
by
barely
yards
off
an
american
armoured
cruiser
was
bearing
down
on
us
she
also
had
seen
the
remarkable
flash
signals
and
was
coming
along
to
watch
over
the
proceedings
in
the
vicinity
of
american
territorial
waters
although
according
to
the
newspapers
the
armoured
cruiser
was
supposed
to
have
been
ordered
into
chesapeake
bay
for
manoeuvres
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
american
government
had
ordered
the
ship
to
go
out
to
the
boundary
line
in
order
to
watch
events
in
connection
with
our
escape
i
am
also
personally
strongly
convinced
that
the
excellent
tone
in
the
officers
mess
and
among
the
crews
of
the
american
marine
would
not
have
allowed
the
men
of
the
armoured
cruiser
in
the
event
of
any
violation
of
the
territorial
water
zone
to
restrict
themselves
merely
to
observation
but
that
they
would
have
taken
an
energetic
part
in
the
proceedings
that
such
a
violation
was
not
by
any
means
beyond
the
realms
of
possibility
and
that
it
was
probably
only
prevented
on
that
memorable
night
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
american
armoured
cruiser
is
borne
out
by
the
following
circumstance
several
days
before
our
departure
an
english
cruiser
had
passed
cape
henry
under
cover
of
mist
and
darkness
and
searched
the
whole
of
chesapeake
bay
in
the
most
shameless
manner
after
which
without
making
her
identity
known
she
disappeared
again
in
the
meantime
we
had
quickly
forced
our
boat
heavily
down
by
the
head
into
the
deeps
and
did
not
rise
to
the
surface
again
till
the
noise
of
the
american
propeller
had
died
away
in
the
distance
we
knew
that
the
most
dangerous
moment
of
our
whole
voyage
was
near
at
hand
we
took
a
careful
view
of
the
situation
once
more
and
made
all
the
necessary
preparations
for
our
deutschland
then
we
submerged
again
and
went
on
all
our
faculties
strained
to
the
uttermost
our
nerves
filled
to
overflowing
with
that
cold
excitement
which
inwardly
so
to
speak
causes
one
hair
to
stand
on
end
while
outwardly
one
is
quite
calm
gripped
in
that
icily
clear
deliberation
which
only
comes
to
those
who
are
fully
conscious
that
they
are
face
to
face
with
an
unknown
danger
we
knew
our
way
it
had
been
already
brought
to
our
knowledge
that
fishermen
had
been
bribed
to
lay
nets
in
stated
positions
outside
the
boundary
line
nets
in
which
we
were
to
be
caught
fast
in
which
moreover
devilish
mines
had
been
interwoven
or
perhaps
the
nets
might
be
merely
attached
to
buoys
which
we
should
drag
along
behind
us
and
thus
betray
our
position
we
were
prepared
for
all
contingencies
and
had
made
everything
ready
to
free
ourselves
from
the
nets
if
the
worst
should
happen
but
the
worst
did
not
happen
it
was
a
dark
night
the
lights
from
the
two
capes
shone
calmly
with
friendly
eyes
on
land
while
a
few
miles
farther
out
death
lurked
in
every
conceivable
form
but
while
the
english
ships
travelled
backwards
and
forwards
lighting
up
the
waters
with
their
searchlights
and
seeking
us
in
every
conceivable
spot
they
little
knew
that
at
times
close
on
their
heels
a
periscope
proceeded
on
its
leisurely
way
and
underneath
this
periscope
the
u
deutschland
at
that
night
after
hours
of
indescribable
tension
the
command
rang
out
rise
to
the
surface
we
were
through
slowly
the
deutschland
rose
through
the
water
the
tanks
were
blown
out
and
the
oil
engines
started
at
full
speed
we
rushed
on
out
into
the
open
freedom
of
the
atlantic
while
behind
us
in
the
the
english
with
whole
bundles
of
searchlights
sought
the
waters
in
vain
they
must
have
grown
somewhat
irritable
towards
the
end
chapter
xiii
the
homeward
journey
never
had
the
deutschland
travelled
so
swiftly
as
in
those
early
morning
hours
of
the
august
with
marvellous
speed
she
raced
on
leaving
two
broad
streaks
of
foam
on
either
side
the
engines
rumbled
in
perfect
rhythm
the
combustion
was
working
without
a
flaw
and
the
exhaust
showed
not
the
slightest
cloud
so
that
even
herr
kiszling
was
thoroughly
contented
and
in
a
moment
of
unconscious
tenderness
nearly
stroked
the
shaft
of
his
beloved
engines
when
the
sun
rose
the
coast
had
long
disappeared
from
sight
in
the
distance
in
a
grey
mist
and
there
was
no
vessel
of
any
kind
to
be
seen
we
remained
on
the
surface
and
raced
on
like
the
very
devil
how
much
we
owed
to
our
engines
on
our
arrival
at
baltimore
after
our
long
and
difficult
journey
they
had
been
still
in
perfect
condition
no
repairs
were
necessary
and
we
could
have
made
the
return
journey
immediately
without
their
being
overhauled
and
yet
the
engines
had
been
obliged
to
work
under
quite
unknown
conditions
under
conditions
which
like
that
of
the
terrible
temperature
in
the
gulf
stream
had
made
the
very
highest
and
most
unforeseen
demands
on
every
part
of
the
machinery
it
can
be
easily
understood
that
hitherto
there
had
been
no
opportunity
of
testing
the
working
capabilities
of
oil
motors
in
an
outside
temperature
of
degrees
fahrenheit
such
a
contingency
could
never
have
been
foreseen
in
the
construction
of
our
type
of
boat
and
the
fact
that
our
motors
never
struck
that
not
the
least
hitch
arose
proves
the
excellence
of
the
construction
and
the
perfect
workmanship
of
the
dockyard
thus
we
continued
on
our
way
and
only
too
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
damp
heated
atmosphere
and
heavy
air
of
the
gulf
stream
with
all
its
beautiful
phenomena
and
peculiarities
its
electrically
laden
air
and
stormy
sea
with
closed
hatches
and
heat
in
the
boat
we
faced
it
once
more
and
the
stream
would
not
even
help
to
push
us
along
on
our
course
as
we
had
hoped
all
hardships
were
however
borne
with
light
hearts
this
time
we
had
left
the
danger
zone
behind
us
and
were
homeward
bound
moreover
the
sea
had
become
calmer
the
nearer
we
approached
the
area
of
the
gulf
stream
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
it
had
become
possible
to
open
all
the
deck
hatches
again
hardly
had
we
begun
to
rejoice
that
the
fresh
air
would
now
make
conditions
below
deck
bearable
once
more
when
suddenly
the
order
came
close
hatches
submerge
a
steamer
had
appeared
and
was
rapidly
approaching
so
directly
in
our
course
that
we
could
not
possibly
have
avoided
her
above
water
when
we
rose
to
the
surface
again
an
hour
later
night
had
set
in
and
with
it
appeared
a
most
marvellous
natural
phenomenon
of
sea
phosphorescence
of
unearthly
splendour
we
had
submerged
in
a
calm
dark
sea
we
now
arose
to
an
ocean
of
flame
a
sea
phosphorescence
had
set
in
of
an
intensity
and
glow
such
as
i
had
never
before
experienced
and
which
is
probably
only
to
be
found
on
the
borders
of
the
gulf
stream
during
our
rise
and
when
we
were
at
about
fathoms
below
the
surface
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
working
upwards
through
a
glowing
realm
of
sparkling
transparency
shortly
before
the
arose
above
water
i
glanced
round
astern
and
saw
the
entire
hull
of
the
boat
with
the
stern
like
a
dark
mass
pushing
its
way
through
the
glowing
element
a
fiery
whirlpool
radiated
from
the
propeller
and
every
movement
of
the
boat
aroused
the
wildest
phosphorescence
intensive
flames
sprays
of
sparks
and
fiery
streaks
in
the
surrounding
waters
above
a
fresh
breeze
had
set
in
and
whipped
the
seething
waters
into
glowing
balls
while
showers
of
sparkling
foam
covered
the
entire
deck
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
surface
of
the
sea
was
one
pale
glowing
mass
through
which
our
boat
ploughed
its
way
in
furrows
of
fire
we
stood
transfixed
as
the
phenomenon
increased
in
intensity
with
the
sea
and
wind
all
the
men
off
duty
came
up
and
stared
out
at
this
enchanting
spectacle
little
heeding
the
seas
which
swept
over
the
deck
soaking
many
of
them
through
to
the
skin
it
looks
like
fire
do
it
but
blowed
if
it
do
put
yer
pipe
out
remarked
our
giant
boatswain
a
spurt
had
just
extinguished
his
pipe
for
the
third
time
and
he
reluctantly
decided
to
store
the
beloved
stump
carefully
in
his
pocket
but
the
fire
grew
wetter
and
wetter
and
within
half
an
hour
the
officers
on
duty
and
stood
once
more
alone
up
in
the
when
we
got
out
of
the
gulf
stream
we
had
several
days
of
stiff
winds
and
high
seas
until
on
the
august
we
ran
into
fine
weather
again
on
one
of
the
following
evenings
the
first
officer
on
duty
krapohl
was
standing
with
humke
in
the
scanning
the
horizon
without
ceasing
through
the
glasses
at
a
point
where
the
pale
sky
seemed
to
merge
into
the
sea
without
any
observable
boundary
line
light
ahead
announced
humke
suddenly
if
you
mean
that
star
i
noticed
it
already
the
officer
replied
calmly
lowering
his
glasses
wal
i
dunno
but
that
there
ai
no
star
herr
krapohl
the
sailor
replied
unabashed
the
two
called
out
to
me
and
i
came
expectantly
out
of
the
tower
took
the
glasses
and
then
laughed
humke
you
on
the
wrong
track
for
i
noticed
high
up
above
the
horizon
a
faint
white
light
which
stood
too
high
judging
by
its
strength
to
be
a
ship
light
the
boatswain
stolidly
maintained
his
opinion
however
that
there
ai
no
star
i
handed
him
the
glasses
which
he
however
put
aside
at
once
remarking
ye
ca
see
nothink
properly
with
them
things
he
shut
his
eyes
tightly
then
took
another
sharp
look
and
said
in
decided
tones
that
ai
no
star
that
be
a
light
we
stared
before
us
with
increased
sharpness
till
i
was
able
at
last
to
make
out
through
the
glasses
a
red
glow
which
now
became
visible
to
the
right
of
the
white
light
now
we
knew
that
a
steamer
was
approaching
us
at
first
i
held
her
to
be
a
small
vessel
particularly
as
to
begin
with
the
height
of
the
two
lights
differed
but
slightly
the
red
port
light
of
the
steamer
was
not
much
below
the
white
light
but
soon
i
was
surprised
to
observe
how
noticeably
the
red
light
moved
that
is
to
say
how
quickly
the
space
between
the
two
lights
appeared
to
increase
from
this
there
was
only
one
possible
conclusion
to
be
drawn
and
that
was
that
the
vessel
was
approaching
with
extraordinary
rapidity
while
i
was
considering
this
and
picturing
it
to
myself
as
a
swiftly
travelling
destroyer
i
discovered
at
a
fair
distance
behind
the
two
lights
something
that
looked
like
a
white
moving
ray
or
like
a
faintly
illuminated
wave
we
could
not
make
out
what
this
meant
till
i
decided
that
this
wave
must
belong
to
the
lights
themselves
as
they
moved
together
and
kept
pace
with
each
other
and
a
few
minutes
later
there
appeared
tremblingly
on
the
strong
lens
of
the
glasses
the
faint
outline
of
a
mighty
steamer
which
with
elaborate
superstructure
was
approaching
in
the
dark
night
the
white
ray
of
light
was
her
stern
water
which
owing
to
the
colossal
length
of
the
ship
was
only
visible
at
a
considerable
distance
from
her
side
lights
for
some
minutes
longer
we
continued
to
stare
then
we
discovered
four
towering
funnels
and
were
soon
convinced
that
we
had
a
big
cunard
liner
in
front
of
us
which
was
racing
up
in
only
showing
her
it
really
was
a
ghostly
apparition
to
observe
how
the
mighty
darkened
ship
raced
on
through
the
night
there
is
not
much
need
to
be
romantically
inclined
in
order
to
picture
this
meeting
with
the
flying
dutchman
while
humke
expressed
his
feelings
in
the
words
lor
she
just
a
beauty
lads
full
speed
ahead
and
with
helm
hard
astarboard
we
slipped
away
from
the
course
of
the
mighty
cunarder
all
the
men
of
the
watch
off
duty
meanwhile
had
come
up
to
get
a
view
of
her
from
the
deck
and
hatches
in
spite
of
a
sharp
nothing
appeared
in
sight
during
the
next
few
days
the
weather
keeping
fine
our
homeward
journey
even
more
than
when
we
were
assumed
the
character
of
a
peaceful
uneventful
business
voyage
it
was
now
that
we
first
began
fully
to
appreciate
the
convenient
and
practical
inner
fittings
of
the
whole
boat
and
particularly
our
cabins
and
cosy
little
often
as
we
sat
round
the
table
at
mess
while
the
gramophones
played
gaily
we
thought
with
gratitude
of
those
who
had
not
only
invented
the
seaworthy
shape
of
our
boat
but
had
fitted
her
interior
up
so
that
a
life
of
comparative
comfort
and
ease
was
possible
even
under
the
sea
when
on
these
occasions
our
gallant
stucke
with
his
blonde
white
hair
his
honest
face
full
of
earnest
gravity
and
his
habitually
surprised
expression
placed
a
bottle
of
good
red
californian
wine
in
front
of
us
as
we
lay
comfortably
somewhere
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
while
overhead
at
a
height
of
x
fathoms
a
hearty
wind
was
blowing
it
needed
little
imagination
to
picture
oneself
as
a
second
captain
nemo
who
with
his
highly
modern
nautilus
could
probe
the
depths
and
snap
his
fingers
at
the
injustice
and
tyranny
of
a
certain
people
provided
that
is
to
say
one
had
read
jules
verne
for
i
must
here
confess
what
i
had
hitherto
carefully
concealed
from
everyone
that
it
was
only
as
captain
of
a
submarine
trader
on
my
return
journey
from
america
that
i
was
enabled
to
make
good
a
very
sad
deficiency
in
my
education
the
chance
i
had
wasted
in
my
youth
i
now
came
across
at
the
age
of
in
the
steel
body
of
the
u
deutschland
of
making
myself
acquainted
with
jules
verne
thousand
leagues
under
the
the
book
had
been
sent
me
while
i
was
at
baltimore
through
the
kindness
of
an
american
friend
it
is
a
book
how
shall
i
describe
it
of
incitement
and
emulation
i
read
it
with
the
greatest
interest
the
rest
of
our
return
journey
is
soon
told
we
travelled
on
smoothly
and
peacefully
homewards
avoiding
a
few
distant
steamers
above
water
in
which
little
game
we
had
gradually
become
extremely
well
practised
and
meeting
on
the
whole
with
good
weather
some
mist
and
much
smooth
sea
one
afternoon
i
was
sitting
working
at
the
in
my
cabin
when
suddenly
i
heard
from
the
close
by
the
order
to
starboard
repeated
immediately
after
came
to
port
whereupon
without
waiting
to
hear
any
more
i
hurried
on
deck
there
a
strange
sight
awaited
me
all
around
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
sea
was
covered
with
a
mass
of
dark
floating
oil
casks
through
which
we
had
to
steer
our
way
at
first
i
took
the
black
objects
which
danced
up
and
down
on
the
waves
before
us
for
a
until
the
characteristic
shape
of
the
sharp
angular
casks
or
barrels
and
their
contents
which
had
spread
partly
over
the
water
testified
to
their
harmlessness
nevertheless
we
had
to
steer
carefully
through
this
strange
plantation
as
the
area
was
too
wide
a
one
to
avoid
without
going
considerably
out
of
our
course
we
estimated
the
number
of
casks
that
were
visible
to
us
as
at
least
a
thousand
fine
practice
remarked
krapohl
for
the
elegance
with
which
we
shall
twist
through
the
english
later
on
i
think
we
might
risk
the
return
through
the
english
channel
we
went
on
therefore
at
to
port
starboard
port
for
over
an
hour
scattered
parts
of
vessels
were
to
be
seen
on
the
water
possibly
the
results
of
wrecks
or
mines
we
must
by
this
time
have
gradually
come
within
the
sphere
of
the
english
ships
the
watch
was
doubled
everyone
standing
at
their
submerging
stations
from
time
to
time
we
noticed
vessels
whose
attention
we
avoided
by
submerging
or
altering
our
course
one
warship
apparently
a
small
english
cruiser
we
allowed
no
possibility
of
seeing
us
by
immediately
diving
when
after
an
hour
undersea
journey
we
again
rose
slowly
to
the
surface
we
saw
from
a
depth
of
fathoms
through
the
periscope
another
english
ship
and
went
down
again
to
fathoms
and
this
was
repeated
three
times
in
succession
at
noon
we
rose
at
last
for
good
emptied
the
tanks
and
then
travelled
at
top
speed
over
the
water
favoured
by
the
fine
weather
we
approached
our
goal
with
considerable
rapidity
and
on
august
at
eight
in
the
evening
we
saw
a
circle
of
white
lights
all
round
the
horizon
our
natural
fear
was
of
course
that
we
were
surrounded
if
we
turned
to
starboard
we
saw
those
accursed
lights
to
port
there
they
were
too
finally
our
excellent
zeiss
glasses
removed
our
fears
that
at
the
last
moment
with
the
homeland
already
in
sight
we
had
fallen
into
a
trap
the
twilight
was
still
clear
enough
to
allow
us
to
see
and
recognize
from
the
construction
of
the
ships
that
only
some
harmless
dutch
fishing
boats
lay
before
us
chapter
xiv
the
arrival
favourable
winds
astern
helped
us
on
towards
home
on
august
at
six
in
the
morning
our
alarm
was
raised
once
more
in
the
far
distance
something
appeared
on
the
water
which
looked
like
the
sail
of
a
boat
though
certainly
of
a
very
strange
appearance
as
it
approached
nearer
the
sail
turned
out
to
be
the
of
a
which
with
her
deck
still
dripping
was
going
on
her
way
although
we
were
at
first
inclined
to
take
careful
and
instructive
observations
of
the
strange
object
in
the
distance
in
order
to
judge
how
we
ourselves
showed
up
at
a
distance
of
three
knots
the
best
course
in
our
case
appeared
to
be
to
find
out
as
quickly
as
possible
if
she
were
an
english
or
a
german
submarine
we
preferred
however
in
any
case
to
make
ourselves
as
unnoticeable
as
possible
and
in
the
last
emergency
to
submerge
we
had
already
flooded
up
to
tank
already
the
sea
broke
over
the
deck
and
struck
against
the
and
even
the
latter
was
cutting
down
through
the
green
waters
when
suddenly
a
flag
signal
rose
yonder
which
gave
us
the
certainty
that
it
was
a
german
in
front
of
us
we
answered
immediately
and
gave
the
command
directly
after
empty
the
ballast
tanks
never
had
i
given
orders
with
such
a
cheerful
heart
on
the
deutschland
before
and
never
was
it
more
cheerfully
carried
out
than
when
i
called
down
to
the
hurrah
the
first
german
in
sight
what
did
it
matter
that
we
were
standing
on
the
tower
and
the
barely
risen
deck
in
oil
and
sea
water
with
a
playing
over
us
there
over
the
green
north
sea
came
the
first
greeting
of
germany
the
mighty
fatherland
towards
us
at
full
speed
we
rushed
on
everyone
on
deck
and
before
long
the
two
boats
lay
within
calling
distance
of
each
other
the
first
hurrah
was
flung
across
to
us
and
answered
in
like
manner
then
greetings
and
news
were
exchanged
and
our
ways
parted
again
ours
towards
home
the
to
her
work
the
day
drew
in
and
night
fell
once
more
so
we
travelled
homewards
no
light
on
deck
no
light
in
the
tower
like
a
dark
shadow
when
the
sun
rose
however
on
the
following
morning
we
saw
before
us
in
the
distance
a
characteristic
silhouette
breaking
through
the
veil
of
mist
in
a
rosy
light
an
island
a
bulwark
in
the
north
sea
heligoland
lay
before
us
soon
life
began
to
awaken
on
the
waters
around
us
shot
up
patrol
boats
hurried
along
flag
signals
fluttered
in
the
air
wireless
signals
rattled
out
their
greetings
and
shouting
and
commenced
and
then
the
iron
ring
of
the
german
fleet
which
keeps
safe
watch
over
yonder
closed
round
our
little
deutschland
and
under
their
protection
we
steered
on
past
heligoland
towards
the
home
haven
but
as
we
approached
the
waters
even
before
the
low
homelike
sandy
coast
came
in
sight
a
wonderful
spectacle
fell
to
our
lot
the
strangest
of
greetings
carried
out
with
the
utmost
skill
from
the
land
two
huge
birds
seemed
to
rise
into
the
air
two
seaplanes
which
approached
at
full
speed
and
then
sank
like
gigantic
on
the
gently
moving
surface
of
the
sea
they
shot
down
with
their
floats
just
brushing
the
surface
of
the
water
till
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
deutschland
made
a
lightning
turn
crashing
by
us
approached
again
and
sprang
literally
over
our
heads
racing
low
down
over
the
with
cheers
and
waving
of
caps
this
was
our
reception
from
the
latest
weapon
of
the
german
navy
one
should
not
make
comparisons
but
as
we
once
more
approached
the
german
coast
surrounded
and
protected
by
the
german
marine
i
suddenly
found
myself
comparing
this
with
our
arrival
in
america
no
one
could
have
been
received
with
more
hearty
enthusiasm
than
we
had
been
by
the
americans
a
free
untroubled
people
they
rejoiced
in
a
bold
deed
and
openly
declared
their
sympathy
for
a
new
and
unheard
of
enterprise
which
it
had
required
men
to
fulfil
but
here
we
were
more
than
bold
and
interesting
adventurers
here
our
own
people
received
us
again
as
helpmates
in
their
mighty
struggle
here
the
delightful
spectacle
of
her
power
under
the
sea
on
the
sea
and
in
the
air
was
presented
to
us
this
was
for
me
the
real
meaning
of
the
glorious
greeting
of
our
airmen
this
was
what
i
felt
as
the
boats
accompanied
us
safely
as
far
as
the
outer
weser
where
we
cast
anchor
before
the
hohenweg
lighthouse
for
the
first
time
after
many
a
long
day
chapter
xv
the
reception
of
the
deutschland
by
the
german
people
from
the
outskirts
of
heligoland
as
far
as
the
outer
weser
we
had
been
received
by
the
navy
on
the
voyage
up
the
weser
and
at
bremen
the
whole
nation
received
us
on
the
afternoon
of
the
august
the
deutschland
had
struck
anchor
at
the
mouth
of
the
weser
the
news
had
been
spread
by
telegraph
throughout
the
whole
country
this
news
which
awakened
unbounded
rejoicings
we
learnt
to
our
surprise
and
proud
delight
that
the
arrival
of
the
deutschland
was
to
inaugurate
a
festive
holiday
for
the
whole
german
people
that
such
a
reception
awaited
our
little
boat
on
the
banks
of
the
weser
as
surely
never
fell
to
the
lot
of
any
lucky
ship
before
our
journey
up
the
weser
assumed
the
nature
of
a
triumphal
procession
behind
the
hundreds
of
thousands
who
had
come
to
meet
us
and
stood
cheering
on
the
banks
stood
invisible
the
millions
of
german
people
inspired
with
the
same
feeling
this
was
expressed
to
us
everywhere
in
overwhelming
rejoicings
from
old
and
young
high
and
low
from
the
german
kaiser
down
to
the
merest
dock
worker
and
the
small
ragged
urchin
who
full
of
enthusiasm
waved
his
flag
and
shouted
in
the
streets
of
bremen
on
the
august
early
in
the
morning
the
deutschland
commenced
her
triumphal
trip
up
the
weser
it
poured
in
torrents
but
nothing
could
quench
the
public
rejoicings
as
we
moved
along
accompanied
by
the
blockaded
steamers
our
masts
and
decorated
with
garlands
of
roses
low
hung
the
dark
clouds
in
the
heavens
and
the
rain
pelted
down
on
the
thousands
who
stood
on
the
dykes
or
who
had
come
to
meet
us
on
steamers
barges
launches
and
rowing
boats
deafening
cheers
arose
from
the
town
and
the
clashing
of
bells
mingled
with
the
joyful
acclamations
while
above
it
all
rose
the
song
of
deutschland

the

the
crowds
as

ship
nears
her

shortly
before

we
reached
lankenau
whose
dyke
had
been
chosen
as
an
observation
point
by
the
whole
of
bremen
it
appeared

the
people
stood
waving
with

at

punctually
the

sailed
into
the
open

and
placed
her
invited
guests

of
deutschland
über
alles
on
the
highly
decorated
pontoon
on
which
the
grand
duke
of
oldenburg
the
representatives
of
the
bremen
senate
and
burghership
the
civilian
and
military
authorities
the
marine
the
shipping
officials
and
among
them
count
zeppelin
were
all
assembled
to
receive
us
as
soon
as
the
ship
was
moored
i
called
the
men
up
to
take
their
positions
on
deck
lohmann
then
addressed
us
in
the
following
speech
your
royal
highness
your
magnificencies
your
excellencies
my
very
honoured
friends
at
this
historical
moment
of
the
happy
return
of
the
first
submarine
of
the
world
after
a
voyage
of
knots
i
here
welcome
our
and
her
gallant
crew
not
only
in
the
name
of
our
shipping
officials
but
of
the
whole
german
people
back
to
the
harbour
of
their
homeland
quietly
and
only
known
to
an
initiated
few
they
left
the
weser
passed
through
and
under
the
english
fleet
to
arrive
on
the
july
at
baltimore
with
a
valuable
cargo
of
dyes
their
arrival
was
a
surprise
to
the
whole
world
even
navigation
experts
shortly
before
this
event
had
declared
it
to
be
an
impossible
undertaking
it
is
with
particular
pleasure
that
i
am
able
to
state
that
all
true
americans
who
are
not
demoralised
by
a
degrading
mammon
service
to
england
men
with
the
instincts
of
a
washington
and
a
franklin
greeted
the
arrival
of
the
in
america
with
warmest
satisfaction
it
is
the
pride
of
our
shipping
officials
that
we
have
been
able
to
send
dyes
to
america
under
the
german
flag
in
the
middle
of
this
war
while
america
herself
can
not
even
get
her
post
from
europe
unmolested
to
say
nothing
of
the
many
other
violations
of
the
rights
of
humanity
by
sea
and
land
on
the
part
of
our
enemy
in
connection
with
the
neutrals
and
particularly
the
small
states
to
accomplish
this
has
been
the
work
of
the
crew
of
the
though
they
started
off
without
any
previous
announcement
their
departure
from
baltimore
was
made
publicly
known
beforehand
resembled
a
triumphal
procession
wrote
havas
a
symbol
of
freedom
i
myself
should
like
to
compare
the
deed
with
our
german
view
of
the
of
the
peoples
on
the
free
ocean
the
enemy
were
not
able
to
prevent
their
departure
from
chesapeake
bay
and
a
blockaded
north
sea
did
not
exist
for
them
on
their
return
voyage
as
will
be
proved
by
the
many
million
marks
worth
of
goods
which
have
been
brought
from
america
and
which
lie
at
this
moment
before
our
eyes
they
have
performed
a
task
of
seamanship
that
is
worthy
of
our
hanseatic
forefathers
everywhere
throughout
german
lands
and
among
our
faithful
allies
but
particularly
among
our
brothers
in
the
trenches
and
in
the
fleet
their
return
voyage
has
been
followed
with
deepest
sympathy
with
strongest
confidence
in
their
judgment
energy
and
sense
of
duty
we
members
of
the
shipping
world
have
looked
forward
to
their
return
after
their
long
and
strenuous
weeks
in
the
narrow
confines
of
a
ship
face
to
face
with
unscrupulous
enemies
i
welcome
them
heartily
back
to
the
homeland
in
the
midst
of
this
murderous
war
i
convey
to
them
the
thanks
of
our
german
people
for
their
peaceful
deed
and
i
should
like
to
express
these
thanks
by
calling
for
three
cheers
for
the
her
commander
captain
könig
her
officers
and
crew
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
i
answered
with
a
brief
toast
to
the
senate
and
burghership
of
the
free
hansa
city
bremen
we
then
boarded
the
pontoon
where
each
one
of
us
was
saluted
and
drawn
into
conversation
by
the
grand
duke
of
oldenburg
and
the
other
gentlemen
present
after
completing
a
distance
of
knots
from
which
only
about
under
water
must
be
deducted
the
first
submarine
had
reached
home
the
deutschland
first
voyage
to
america
was
completed
on
the
evening
of
this
memorable
day
a
big
dinner
was
given
at
the
town
hall
by
the
municipality
of
the
borough
of
bremen
to
celebrate
the
homecoming
of
the
deutschland
the
speeches
that
were
delivered
on
this
occasion
give
a
short
outline
of
the
circumstances
which
led
to
the
building
of
the
deutschland
and
for
this
reason
they
shall
be
repeated
here
barkhausen
the
mayor
had
received
his
guests
with
words
of
hearty
welcome
and
informed
them
of
the
municipality
decision
to
have
a
special
medal
struck
in
memory
of
the
day
and
had
then
toasted
the
german
shipping
officials
and
the
crew
of
the
submarine
deutschland
in
the
name
of
the
shipping
federation
their
chief
representative
lohmann
replied
in
the
following
words
your
magnificencies
your
excellencies
my
most
honoured
gentlemen
in
the
name
of
the
commander
of
the
captain
könig
and
of
his
officers
and
crew
i
wish
to
express
to
the
municipality
their
most
heartfelt
thanks
as
also
that
of
the
shipping
federation
for
the
great
honour
granted
by
the
municipality
to
the
crew
of
the
in
allowing
a
medal
to
be
struck
in
commemoration
of
this
peaceful
commercial
deed
in
the
midst
of
war
i
wish
to
thank
your
excellencies
for
the
words
in
which
you
have
graciously
acknowledged
the
work
of
my
colleagues
and
myself
since
the
outbreak
of
war
i
have
gladly
and
willingly
devoted
my
efforts
towards
the
welfare
of
the
state
the
conviction
that
our
splendid
people
in
spite
of
the
superior
force
of
the
enemy
are
not
to
be
crushed
in
this
defensive
war
for
their
individuality
and
freedom
that
the
intellectual
power
and
forethought
which
inspire
our
entire
people
their
thorough
training
since
the
wars
of
liberation
and
the
inborn
sense
of
duty
which
has
come
down
to
every
german
in
flesh
and
blood
are
not
to
be
overcome
this
conviction
has
accompanied
me
throughout
all
my
efforts
and
everywhere
i
have
met
faithful
colleagues
who
were
of
the
same
opinion
i
should
like
therefore
at
this
point
to
express
my
heartfelt
thanks
to
all
my
and
in
particular
to
herr
direktor
stapelfeldts
and
my
colleagues
on
the
board
herr
heineken
and
herr
hermann
councillor
of
commerce
the
german
ocean
shipping
federation
was
formed
as
your
excellencies
have
already
stated
in
all
secrecy
and
their
task
consisted
in
forwarding
goods
of
the
utmost
possible
value
it
meant
moreover
purchasing
the
raw
materials
on
the
other
side
their
careful
warehousing
the
placing
of
the
in
a
safe
position
and
protecting
her
from
all
attacks
this
was
carried
out
to
perfection
by
the
north
german
lloyd
agents
herr
paul
hilken
and
his
father
herr
hilken
senior
as
well
as
by
captain
hinsch
and
his
the
share
which
captain
könig
and
his
officers
and
crew
took
in
the
enterprise
has
already
been
brought
into
prominence
by
your
excellencies
for
my
part
and
on
behalf
of
the
shipping
directors
i
should
like
here
once
more
to
tender
our
on
the
our
very
hearty
thanks
it
will
interest
the
gentlemen
present
to
hear
something
of
the
history
of
the
german
ocean
shipping
federation
and
of
the
the
and
her
as
yet
unnamed
sister
ships
when
in
september
it
became
evident
that
in
spite
of
all
the
successes
of
the
central
powers
the
war
would
continue
for
many
months
yet
it
was
obvious
that
germany
demand
for
rubber
and
metals
was
of
burning
necessity
i
therefore
took
the
shipbuilding
authorities
in
bremen
into
my
confidence
after
i
had
held
counsel
with
one
of
the
most
prominent
shipbuilding
experts
the
declared
itself
ready
to
draw
up
and
carry
out
the
plans
for
a
submarine
boat
of
about
tons
carrying
power
on
the
october
i
came
into
possession
of
the
completed
plans
of
this
boat
the
period
of
construction
unfortunately
ran
into
eleven
months
the
delivery
being
therefore
completed
about
september
for
the
docks
were
first
obliged
to
have
the
motors
built
it
was
obvious
that
we
must
make
an
effort
another
time
if
possible
to
reach
our
object
more
quickly
almost
at
the
same
time
that
the
practical
evolution
of
a
submarine
merchantman
was
under
our
consideration
the
germania
dock
at
kiel
had
unknown
to
us
handed
over
at
the
beginning
of
october
to
their
chief
house
friedrich
krupp
and
sons
plans
for
the
construction
of
a
of
about
tons
carrying
capacity
the
germania
docks
were
prepared
in
the
short
space
of
six
months
to
deliver
the
first
boat
the
as
early
as
april
both
plans
those
of
the
germania
docks
as
well
as
my
own
showed
that
the
project
was
possible
to
carry
out
and
i
should
like
to
compare
this
community
of
ideas
with
a
happy
marriage
where
husband
and
wife
are
in
perfect
harmony
with
each
other
the
dockyard
as
the
mother
who
brings
the
child
into
the
world
and
gives
it
to
the
father
the
shipowners
and
commerce
to
place
it
in
the
world
the
soul
and
mind
of
the
child
were
incorporated
in
our
captain
our
officers
and
crew
who
have
performed
the
glorious
task
of
taking
the
to
america
and
back
on
the
october
we
had
come
to
an
agreement
and
the
construction
of
two
boats
was
taken
over
by
the
germania
docks
from
the
syndicate
the
formal
part
of
the
establishment
of
the
german
ocean
shipping
federation
was
delayed
somewhat
its
establishment
took
place
on
the
november
and
the
boats
which
had
in
the
meantime
been
ordered
by
our
syndicate
were
already
under
construction
as
far
as
their
framework
the
was
delivered
over
to
us
at
the
beginning
of
april
it
was
a
wonderful
masterpiece
of
the
germania
docks
and
as
is
usual
with
all
the
work
of
friedrich
krupp
and
sons
it
was
perfectly
carried
out
before
we
sent
our
to
america
we
made
trial
trips
with
her
for
over
two
months
the
execution
of
the
work
proved
to
have
been
carried
out
perfectly
in
every
respect
captain
könig
was
able
to
announce
from
america
that
after
a
voyage
of
over
knots
ship
and
machinery
were
in
perfect
working
order
his
report
on
arriving
here
in
bremen
harbour
was
just
the
same
it
is
a
masterpiece
of
german
technique
and
the
name
of
krupp
and
sons
appears
in
shining
colours
once
again
from
the
creation
of
our
artillery
from
the
down
to
the
smallest
specimen
of
ship
guns
that
began
successfully
to
break
the
chain
of
the
british
fleet
in
the
skagerrack
and
prepare
the
way
for
free
trade
among
the
nations
to
the
production
of
arms
and
war
material
of
every
description
the
german
people
now
owe
their
thanks
for
this
perfect
piece
of
construction
to
the
ingenious
leaders
and
directors
of
the
greatest
works
in
the
world
without
krupp
our
enemies
would
not
now
after
two
years
of
war
be
standing
everywhere
on
the
other
side
of
their
boundary
lines
the
intelligent
of
mind
and
body
the
employment
of
all
the
newest
scientific
discoveries
added
to
the
true
german
sense
of
duty
these
are
the
qualities
that
have
made
krupp
and
sons
famous
on
the
return
of
the
we
are
face
to
face
with
another
wonderful
production
of
shipbuilding
technique
on
the
part
of
the
firm
of
krupp
and
for
this
also
the
german
people
owe
their
thanks
to
them
i
should
like
to
ask
you
all
gentlemen
to
give
expression
to
these
thanks
by
joining
with
me
in
three
hearty
cheers
the
firm
of
friedrich
krupp
and
sons
germania
docks
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
after
the
next
course
herr
zetzmann
the
director
of
the
germania
docks
at
kiel
proceeded
as
follows
your
magnificencies
your
excellencies
most
honoured
gentlemen
to
my
lot
has
fallen
the
honour
of
expressing
in
the
name
of
the
firm
of
friedrich
krupp
and
sons
and
of
the
germania
docks
our
heartiest
thanks
for
the
invitation
that
has
been
extended
us
by
the
municipality
and
i
also
take
the
liberty
of
extending
my
thanks
to
the
distinguished
guests
of
the
corporation
assembled
here
herr
lohmann
has
made
some
interesting
communications
in
his
speech
with
regard
to
the
history
of
the
origin
of
the
german
ocean
shipping
federation
and
i
should
like
to
add
a
few
words
about
the
workshop
from
which
the
and
sprang
we
had
been
forced
to
admit
for
some
time
past
that
owing
to
the
continued
duration
of
the
war
the
need
of
certain
building
materials
was
becoming
increasingly
urgent
from
the
conversational
remarks
might
be
possible
and
really
ought
to
arose
the
decision
to
consider
seriously
the
possibility
of
a
new
kind
of
trading
vessel
the
decision
was
no
easy
one
not
merely
because
we
feared
the
difficulty
of
construction
but
because
we
hardly
dared
to
place
a
fresh
load
on
our
building
yards
which
were
already
heavily
overburdened
with
war
orders
but
necessity
teaches
how
to
beg
and
also
how
to
construct
we
next
tried
to
work
on
the
foundations
of
our
war
boats
in
the
hope
that
by
this
means
we
should
lessen
the
constructional
work
we
found
however
that
on
these
lines
reliable
tonnage
capacity
and
carefully
measured
space
were
not
to
be
attained
our
leading
constructors
advised
me
therefore
to
go
radically
to
work
and
not
to
try
and
make
a
trader
out
of
a
warship
but
to
create
a
new
type
of
trading
boat
altogether
the
shape
of
this
was
to
be
made
full
and
rounded
and
exact
calculations
gave
us
a
better
tonnage
much
to
our
surprise
and
pleasure
than
we
had
anticipated
at
the
commencement
of
our
project
with
wild
enthusiasm
our
constructors
completed
their
plans
and
soon
we
stood
face
to
face
with
a
picture
whose
transformation
into
reality
would
express
our
every
wish
herr
krupp
von
bohlen
and
the
directors
seized
on
our
proposal
with
the
greatest
energy
and
declared
that
a
boat
of
this
type
must
most
certainly
be
produced
and
in
the
shortest
possible
space
of
time
that
moreover
the
germania
docks
would
begin
directly
on
the
construction
of
the
boat
on
their
own
responsibility
everything
went
like
clockwork
there
remains
only
one
thing
more
for
me
to
say
that
we
succeeded
in
completing
the
first
boat
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
is
due
in
a
great
measure
to
our
principal
firm
and
to
our
contractors
who
delivered
all
our
building
materials
and
necessary
fittings
in
spite
of
the
other
great
demands
that
were
made
upon
them
with
astonishing
rapidity
i
wish
particularly
to
express
my
appreciation
that
all
the
dealings
with
the
german
ocean
shipping
federation
and
later
with
the
staff
of
the
boat
were
completed
in
the
most
friendly
of
spirits
both
shipping
federation
and
command
staff
have
met
all
our
proposals
with
the
greatest
confidence
it
is
owing
to
this
intelligent
and
preference
that
the
rapidity
of
the
construction
was
made
possible
and
that
the
trial
voyages
went
so
smoothly
with
the
greatest
confidence
therefore
we
saw
the
ship
undertake
her
first
voyage
our
confidence
has
brilliantly
justified
itself
our
most
ardent
wishes
with
which
we
followed
this
product
of
our
dockyard
have
been
fully
realised
we
wish
the
shipping
federation
further
brilliant
successes
of
this
kind
the
and
her
sister
ships
many
equally
happy
voyages
for
the
welfare
of
our
beloved
fatherland
and
for
the
glory
of
our
revered
hansa
city
bremen
celebration
will
be
for
all
who
have
taken
part
in
it
a
remembrance
that
they
will
carry
to
the
end
of
their
lives
and
the
celebration
has
been
brought
to
a
close
in
the
most
approved
fashion
by
the
dinner
given
in
the
new
town
hall
by
the
municipality
when
this
new
part
of
the
town
hall
has
grown
as
as
the
old
perhaps
tales
will
be
told
of
how
the
successful
ocean
voyage
of
the
first
submarine
in
the
world
was
celebrated
here
together
with
our
thanks
for
the
splendid
feast
i
should
like
to
join
my
good
wishes
for
bremen
and
i
ask
the
honourable
gentlemen
present
to
join
in
the
toast
life
and
prosperity
to
the

corporation
of
