part
i
chapter
one
the
i
spent
of
my
journey
looking
out
of
the
window
of
a
carriage
the
next
in
a
local
following
the
course
of
a
trout
stream
in
a
shallow
valley
and
the
last
tramping
over
a
ridge
of
downland
through
great
to
my
quarters
for
the
night
in
the
first
part
i
was
in
an
infamous
temper
in
the
second
i
was
worried
and
mystified
but
the
cool
twilight
of
the
third
stage
calmed
and
heartened
me
and
i
reached
the
gates
of
fosse
manor
with
a
mighty
appetite
and
a
quiet
mind
as
we
slipped
up
the
thames
valley
on
the
smooth
great
western
line
i
had
reflected
ruefully
on
the
thorns
in
the
path
of
duty
for
more
than
a
year
i
had
never
been
out
of
khaki
except
the
months
i
spent
in
hospital
they
gave
me
my
battalion
before
the
somme
and
i
came
out
of
that
weary
battle
after
the
first
big
september
fighting
with
a
crack
in
my
head
and
a
i
had
received
a
for
the
erzerum
business
so
what
with
these
and
my
matabele
and
south
african
medals
and
the
legion
of
honour
i
had
a
chest
like
the
high
priest
breastplate
i
rejoined
in
january
and
got
a
brigade
on
the
eve
of
arras
there
we
had
a
star
turn
and
took
about
as
many
prisoners
as
we
put
infantry
over
the
top
after
that
we
were
hauled
out
for
a
month
and
subsequently
planted
in
a
bad
bit
on
the
scarpe
with
a
hint
that
we
would
soon
be
used
for
a
big
push
then
suddenly
i
was
ordered
home
to
report
to
the
war
office
and
passed
on
by
them
to
bullivant
and
his
merry
men
so
here
i
was
sitting
in
a
railway
carriage
in
a
grey
tweed
suit
with
a
neat
new
suitcase
on
the
rack
labelled
the
initials
stood
for
cornelius
brand
for
that
was
my
name
now
and
an
old
boy
in
the
corner
was
asking
me
questions
and
wondering
audibly
why
i
fighting
while
a
young
blood
of
a
second
lieutenant
with
a
wound
stripe
was
eyeing
me
with
scorn
the
old
chap
was
one
of
the
type
and
after
he
had
borrowed
my
matches
he
set
to
work
to
find
out
all
about
me
he
was
a
tremendous
and
a
bit
of
a
pessimist
about
our
slow
progress
in
the
west
i
told
him
i
came
from
south
africa
and
was
a
mining
engineer
fighting
with
botha
he
asked
i
said
not
the
fighting
kind
the
second
lieutenant
screwed
up
his
nose
there
no
conscription
in
south
africa
god
there
is
i
said
and
the
old
fellow
begged
permission
to
tell
me
a
lot
of
unpalatable
things
i
knew
his
kind
and
did
give
much
for
it
he
was
the
sort
who
if
he
had
been
under
fifty
would
have
crawled
on
his
belly
to
his
tribunal
to
get
exempted
but
being
over
age
was
able
to
pose
as
a
patriot
but
i
did
like
the
second
lieutenant
grin
for
he
seemed
a
good
class
of
lad
i
looked
steadily
out
of
the
window
for
the
rest
of
the
way
and
was
sorry
when
i
got
to
my
station
i
had
had
the
queerest
interview
with
bullivant
and
macgillivray
they
asked
me
first
if
i
was
willing
to
serve
again
in
the
old
game
and
i
said
i
was
i
felt
as
bitter
as
sin
for
i
had
got
fixed
in
the
military
groove
and
had
made
good
there
here
was
i
a
brigadier
and
still
under
forty
and
with
another
year
of
the
war
there
was
no
saying
where
i
might
end
i
had
started
out
without
any
ambition
only
a
great
wish
to
see
the
business
finished
but
now
i
had
acquired
a
professional
interest
in
the
thing
i
had
a
nailing
good
brigade
and
i
had
got
the
hang
of
our
new
kind
of
war
as
well
as
any
fellow
from
sandhurst
and
camberley
they
were
asking
me
to
scrap
all
i
had
learned
and
start
again
in
a
new
job
i
had
to
agree
for
discipline
but
i
could
have
knocked
their
heads
together
in
my
vexation
what
was
worse
they
would
or
could
tell
me
anything
about
what
they
wanted
me
for
it
was
the
old
game
of
running
me
in
blinkers
they
asked
me
to
take
it
on
trust
and
put
myself
unreservedly
in
their
hands
i
would
get
my
instructions
later
they
said
i
asked
if
it
was
important
bullivant
narrowed
his
eyes
it
were
do
you
suppose
we
could
have
wrung
an
active
brigadier
out
of
the
war
office
as
it
was
it
was
like
drawing
teeth
it
risky
was
my
next
question
the
long
run
damnably
was
the
answer
you
ca
tell
me
anything
more
as
yet
you
get
your
instructions
soon
enough
you
know
both
of
us
hannay
and
you
know
we
would
waste
the
time
of
a
good
man
on
folly
we
are
going
to
ask
you
for
something
which
will
make
a
big
call
on
your
patriotism
it
will
be
a
difficult
and
arduous
task
and
it
may
be
a
very
grim
one
before
you
get
to
the
end
of
it
but
we
believe
you
can
do
it
and
that
no
one
else
can
you
know
us
pretty
well
will
you
let
us
judge
for
you
i
looked
at
bullivant
shrewd
kind
old
face
and
macgillivray
steady
eyes
these
men
were
my
friends
and
would
play
with
me
right
i
said
willing
what
the
first
step
out
of
uniform
and
forget
you
ever
were
a
soldier
change
your
name
your
old
one
cornelis
brandt
will
do
but
you
better
spell
it
brand
this
time
remember
that
you
are
an
engineer
just
back
from
south
africa
and
that
you
do
care
a
rush
about
the
war
you
understand
what
all
the
fools
are
fighting
about
and
you
think
we
might
have
peace
at
once
by
a
little
friendly
business
talk
you
need
be
if
you
like
you
can
be
rather
severe
on
the
hun
but
you
must
be
in
deadly
earnest
about
a
speedy
peace
i
expect
the
corners
of
my
mouth
fell
for
bullivant
burst
out
laughing
it
all
man
it
not
so
difficult
i
feel
sometimes
inclined
to
argue
that
way
myself
when
my
dinner
does
agree
with
me
it
not
so
hard
as
to
wander
round
the
fatherland
abusing
britain
which
was
your
last
job
ready
i
said
i
want
to
do
one
errand
on
my
own
first
i
must
see
a
fellow
in
my
brigade
who
is
in
a
hospital
in
the
cotswolds
isham
the
name
of
the
place
the
two
men
exchanged
glances
looks
like
fate
said
bullivant
all
means
go
to
isham
the
place
where
your
work
begins
is
only
a
couple
of
miles
off
i
want
you
to
spend
next
thursday
night
as
the
guest
of
two
maiden
ladies
called
wymondham
at
fosse
manor
you
will
go
down
there
as
a
lone
south
african
visiting
a
sick
friend
they
are
hospitable
souls
and
entertain
many
angels
unawares
i
get
my
orders
there
get
your
orders
and
you
are
under
bond
to
obey
them
and
bullivant
and
macgillivray
smiled
at
each
other
i
was
thinking
hard
about
that
odd
conversation
as
the
small
ford
car
which
i
had
wired
for
to
the
inn
carried
me
away
from
the
suburbs
of
the
county
town
into
a
land
of
rolling
hills
and
green
it
was
a
gorgeous
afternoon
and
the
blossom
of
early
june
was
on
every
tree
but
i
had
no
eyes
for
landscape
and
the
summer
being
engaged
in
reprobating
bullivant
and
cursing
my
fantastic
fate
i
detested
my
new
part
and
looked
forward
to
naked
shame
it
was
bad
enough
for
anyone
to
have
to
pose
as
a
pacifist
but
for
me
strong
as
a
bull
and
as
sunburnt
as
a
gipsy
and
not
looking
my
forty
years
it
was
a
black
disgrace
to
go
into
germany
as
an
afrikander
was
a
stoutish
adventure
but
to
lounge
about
at
home
talking
rot
was
a
very
job
my
stomach
rose
at
the
thought
of
it
and
i
had
pretty
well
decided
to
wire
to
bullivant
and
cry
off
there
are
some
things
that
no
one
has
a
right
to
ask
of
any
white
man
when
i
got
to
isham
and
found
poor
old
blaikie
i
did
feel
happier
he
had
been
a
friend
of
mine
in
rhodesia
and
after
the
german
affair
was
over
had
come
home
to
a
fusilier
battalion
which
was
in
my
brigade
at
arras
he
had
been
buried
by
a
big
crump
just
before
we
got
our
second
objective
and
was
dug
out
without
a
scratch
on
him
but
as
daft
as
a
hatter
i
had
heard
he
was
mending
and
had
promised
his
family
to
look
him
up
the
first
chance
i
got
i
found
him
sitting
on
a
garden
seat
staring
steadily
before
him
like
a
lookout
at
sea
he
knew
me
all
right
and
cheered
up
for
a
second
but
very
soon
he
was
back
at
his
staring
and
every
word
he
uttered
was
like
the
careful
speech
of
a
drunken
man
a
bird
flew
out
of
a
bush
and
i
could
see
him
holding
himself
tight
to
keep
from
screaming
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
stroke
him
as
one
strokes
a
frightened
horse
the
sight
of
the
price
my
old
friend
had
paid
put
me
in
love
with
pacificism
we
talked
of
brother
officers
and
south
africa
for
i
wanted
to
keep
his
thoughts
off
the
war
but
he
kept
edging
round
to
it
long
will
the
damned
thing
last
he
asked
it
practically
over
i
lied
cheerfully
more
fighting
for
you
and
precious
little
for
me
the
boche
is
done
in
all
right
what
you
got
to
do
my
lad
is
to
sleep
fourteen
hours
in
the
and
spend
half
the
rest
catching
trout
we
have
a
shot
at
the
together
this
autumn
and
we
get
some
of
the
old
gang
to
join
us
someone
put
a
on
the
table
beside
us
and
i
looked
up
to
see
the
very
prettiest
girl
i
ever
set
eyes
on
she
seemed
little
more
than
a
child
and
before
the
war
would
probably
have
still
ranked
as
a
flapper
she
wore
the
neat
blue
dress
and
apron
of
a
and
her
white
cap
was
set
on
hair
like
spun
gold
she
smiled
demurely
as
she
arranged
the
and
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
eyes
at
once
so
merry
and
so
grave
i
stared
after
her
as
she
walked
across
the
lawn
and
i
remember
noticing
that
she
moved
with
the
free
grace
of
an
athletic
boy
on
earth
that
i
asked
blaikie
oh
one
of
the
sisters
he
said
listlessly
are
squads
of
them
i
ca
tell
one
from
another
nothing
gave
me
such
an
impression
of
my
friend
sickness
as
the
fact
that
he
should
have
no
interest
in
something
so
fresh
and
jolly
as
that
girl
presently
my
time
was
up
and
i
had
to
go
and
as
i
looked
back
i
saw
him
sunk
in
his
chair
again
his
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
and
his
hands
gripping
his
knees
the
thought
of
him
depressed
me
horribly
here
was
i
condemned
to
some
rotten
buffoonery
in
inglorious
safety
while
the
salt
of
the
earth
like
blaikie
was
paying
the
ghastliest
price
from
him
my
thoughts
flew
to
old
peter
pienaar
and
i
sat
down
on
a
roadside
wall
and
read
his
last
letter
it
nearly
made
me
howl
peter
you
must
know
had
shaved
his
beard
and
joined
the
royal
flying
corps
the
summer
before
when
we
got
back
from
the
greenmantle
affair
that
was
the
only
kind
of
reward
he
wanted
and
though
he
was
absurdly
over
age
the
authorities
allowed
it
they
were
wise
not
to
stickle
about
rules
for
eyesight
and
nerve
were
as
good
as
those
of
any
boy
of
twenty
i
knew
he
would
do
well
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
his
immediately
blazing
success
he
got
his
pilot
certificate
in
record
time
and
went
out
to
france
and
presently
even
we
busy
shifting
ground
before
the
somme
began
to
hear
rumours
of
his
doings
he
developed
a
perfect
genius
for
there
were
plenty
better
and
plenty
who
knew
more
about
the
science
of
the
game
but
there
was
no
one
with
quite
peter
genius
for
an
actual
scrap
he
was
as
full
of
dodges
a
couple
of
miles
up
in
the
sky
as
he
had
been
among
the
rocks
of
the
berg
he
apparently
knew
how
to
hide
in
the
empty
air
as
cleverly
as
in
the
long
grass
of
the
lebombo
flats
amazing
yarns
began
to
circulate
among
the
infantry
about
this
new
airman
who
could
take
cover
below
one
plane
of
an
enemy
squadron
while
all
the
rest
were
looking
for
him
i
remember
talking
about
him
with
the
south
africans
when
we
were
out
resting
next
door
to
them
after
the
bloody
delville
wood
business
the
day
before
we
had
seen
a
good
battle
in
the
clouds
when
the
boche
plane
had
crashed
and
a
transvaal
officer
brought
the
report
that
the
british
airman
had
been
pienaar
done
the
old
he
cried
and
started
to
yarn
about
methods
it
appeared
that
peter
had
a
theory
that
every
man
has
a
blind
spot
and
that
he
knew
just
how
to
find
that
blind
spot
in
the
world
of
air
the
best
cover
he
maintained
was
not
in
cloud
or
a
wisp
of
fog
but
in
the
unseeing
patch
in
the
eye
of
your
enemy
i
recognized
that
talk
for
the
real
thing
it
was
on
a
par
with
peter
doctrine
of
and
double
bluff
and
all
the
other
principles
that
his
queer
old
mind
had
cogitated
out
of
his
rackety
life
by
the
end
of
august
that
year
peter
was
about
the
figure
in
the
flying
corps
if
the
reports
had
mentioned
names
he
would
have
been
a
national
hero
but
he
was
only
blank
and
the
newspapers
which
expatiated
on
his
deeds
had
to
praise
the
service
and
not
the
man
that
was
right
enough
for
half
the
magic
of
our
flying
corps
was
its
freedom
from
advertisement
but
the
british
army
knew
all
about
him
and
the
men
in
the
trenches
used
to
discuss
him
as
if
he
were
a
crack
there
was
a
very
big
german
airman
called
lensch
one
of
the
albatross
heroes
who
about
the
end
of
august
claimed
to
have
destroyed
allied
machines
peter
had
then
only
seventeen
planes
to
his
credit
but
he
was
rapidly
increasing
his
score
lensch
was
a
mighty
man
of
valour
and
a
good
sportsman
after
his
fashion
he
was
amazingly
quick
at
manoeuvring
his
machine
in
the
actual
fight
but
peter
was
supposed
to
be
better
at
forcing
the
kind
of
fight
he
wanted
lensch
if
you
like
was
the
tactician
and
peter
the
strategist
anyhow
the
two
were
out
to
get
each
other
there
were
plenty
of
fellows
who
saw
the
campaign
as
a
struggle
not
between
hun
and
briton
but
between
lensch
and
pienaar
the
september
came
and
i
got
knocked
out
and
went
to
hospital
when
i
was
fit
to
read
the
papers
again
and
receive
letters
i
found
to
my
consternation
that
peter
had
been
downed
it
happened
at
the
end
of
october
when
the
southwest
gales
badly
handicapped
our
airwork
when
our
bombing
or
reconnaissance
jobs
behind
the
enemy
lines
were
completed
instead
of
being
able
to
glide
back
into
safety
we
had
to
fight
our
way
home
slowly
against
a
exposed
to
archies
and
hun
planes
somewhere
east
of
bapaume
on
a
return
journey
peter
fell
in
with
lensch
at
least
the
german
press
gave
lensch
the
credit
his
petrol
tank
was
shot
to
bits
and
he
was
forced
to
descend
in
a
wood
near
morchies
celebrated
british
airman
pinner
in
the
words
of
the
german
communique
was
made
prisoner
i
had
no
letter
from
him
till
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
when
i
was
preparing
to
return
to
france
it
was
a
very
contented
letter
he
seemed
to
have
been
fairly
well
treated
though
he
had
always
a
low
standard
of
what
he
expected
from
the
world
in
the
way
of
comfort
i
inferred
that
his
captors
had
not
identified
in
the
brilliant
airman
the
dutch
miscreant
who
a
year
before
had
broken
out
of
a
german
jail
he
had
discovered
the
pleasures
of
reading
and
had
perfected
himself
in
an
art
which
he
had
once
practised
indifferently
somehow
or
other
he
had
got
a
from
which
he
seemed
to
extract
enormous
pleasure
and
then
at
the
end
quite
casually
he
mentioned
that
he
had
been
badly
wounded
and
that
his
left
leg
would
never
be
much
use
again
after
that
i
got
frequent
letters
and
i
wrote
to
him
every
week
and
sent
him
every
kind
of
parcel
i
could
think
of
his
letters
used
to
make
me
both
ashamed
and
happy
i
had
always
banked
on
old
peter
and
here
he
was
behaving
like
an
early
christian
martyr
never
a
word
of
complaint
and
just
as
cheery
as
if
it
were
a
winter
morning
on
the
high
veld
and
we
were
off
to
ride
down
springbok
i
knew
what
the
loss
of
a
leg
must
mean
to
him
for
bodily
fitness
had
always
been
his
pride
the
rest
of
life
must
have
unrolled
itself
before
him
very
drab
and
dusty
to
the
grave
but
he
wrote
as
if
he
were
on
the
top
of
his
form
and
kept
commiserating
me
on
the
discomforts
of
my
job
the
picture
of
that
patient
gentle
old
fellow
hobbling
about
his
compound
and
puzzling
over
his
a
cripple
for
life
after
five
months
of
blazing
glory
would
have
stiffened
the
back
of
a
jellyfish
this
last
letter
was
horribly
touching
for
summer
had
come
and
the
smell
of
the
woods
behind
his
prison
reminded
peter
of
a
place
in
the
woodbush
and
one
could
read
in
every
sentence
the
ache
of
exile
i
sat
on
that
stone
wall
and
considered
how
trifling
were
the
crumpled
leaves
in
my
bed
of
life
compared
with
the
thorns
peter
and
blaikie
had
to
lie
on
i
thought
of
sandy
far
off
in
mesopotamia
and
old
blenkiron
groaning
with
dyspepsia
somewhere
in
america
and
i
considered
that
they
were
the
kind
of
fellows
who
did
their
jobs
without
complaining
the
result
was
that
when
i
got
up
to
go
on
i
had
recovered
a
manlier
temper
i
was
going
to
shame
my
friends
or
pick
and
choose
my
duty
i
would
trust
myself
to
providence
for
as
blenkiron
used
to
say
providence
was
all
right
if
you
gave
him
a
chance
it
was
not
only
peter
letter
that
steadied
and
calmed
me
isham
stood
high
up
in
a
fold
of
the
hills
away
from
the
main
valley
and
the
road
i
was
taking
brought
me
over
the
ridge
and
back
to
the
i
climbed
through
great
beechwoods
which
seemed
in
the
twilight
like
some
green
place
far
below
the
sea
and
then
over
a
short
stretch
of
hill
pasture
to
the
rim
of
the
vale
all
about
me
were
little
fields
enclosed
with
walls
of
grey
stone
and
full
of
dim
sheep
below
were
dusky
woods
around
what
i
took
to
be
fosse
manor
for
the
great
roman
fosse
way
straight
as
an
arrow
passed
over
the
hills
to
the
south
and
skirted
its
grounds
i
could
see
the
stream
slipping
among
its
and
could
hear
the
plash
of
the
weir
a
tiny
village
settled
in
a
crook
of
the
hill
and
its
sounded
seven
with
a
curiously
sweet
chime
otherwise
there
was
no
noise
but
the
twitter
of
small
birds
and
the
night
wind
in
the
tops
of
the
beeches
in
that
moment
i
had
a
kind
of
revelation
i
had
a
vision
of
what
i
had
been
fighting
for
what
we
all
were
fighting
for
it
was
peace
deep
and
holy
and
ancient
peace
older
than
the
oldest
wars
peace
which
would
endure
when
all
our
swords
were
hammered
into
ploughshares
it
was
more
for
in
that
hour
england
first
took
hold
of
me
before
my
country
had
been
south
africa
and
when
i
thought
of
home
it
had
been
the
wide
spaces
of
the
veld
or
some
scented
glen
of
the
berg
but
now
i
realized
that
i
had
a
new
home
i
understood
what
a
precious
thing
this
little
england
was
how
old
and
kindly
and
comforting
how
wholly
worth
striving
for
the
freedom
of
an
acre
of
her
soil
was
cheaply
bought
by
the
blood
of
the
best
of
us
i
knew
what
it
meant
to
be
a
poet
though
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
have
made
a
line
of
verse
for
in
that
hour
i
had
a
prospect
as
if
from
a
hilltop
which
made
all
the
present
troubles
of
the
road
seem
of
no
account
i
saw
not
only
victory
after
war
but
a
new
and
happier
world
after
victory
when
i
should
inherit
something
of
this
english
peace
and
wrap
myself
in
it
till
the
end
of
my
days
very
humbly
and
quietly
like
a
man
walking
through
a
cathedral
i
went
down
the
hill
to
the
manor
lodge
and
came
to
a
door
in
an
old
facade
smothered
in
magnolias
which
smelt
like
hot
lemons
in
the
june
dusk
the
car
from
the
inn
had
brought
on
my
baggage
and
presently
i
was
dressing
in
a
room
which
looked
out
on
a
for
the
first
time
for
more
than
a
year
i
put
on
a
starched
shirt
and
a
and
as
i
dressed
i
could
have
sung
from
pure
lightheartedness
i
was
in
for
some
arduous
job
and
sometime
that
evening
in
that
place
i
should
get
my
marching
orders
someone
would
arrive
perhaps
bullivant
and
read
me
the
riddle
but
whatever
it
was
i
was
ready
for
it
for
my
whole
being
had
found
a
new
purpose
living
in
the
trenches
you
are
apt
to
get
your
horizon
narrowed
down
to
the
front
line
of
enemy
barbed
wire
on
one
side
and
the
nearest
rest
billets
on
the
other
but
now
i
seemed
to
see
beyond
the
fog
to
a
happy
country
voices
greeted
my
ears
as
i
came
down
the
broad
staircase
voices
which
scarcely
accorded
with
the
panelled
walls
and
the
austere
family
portraits
and
when
i
found
my
hostesses
in
the
hall
i
thought
their
looks
still
less
in
keeping
with
the
house
both
ladies
were
on
the
wrong
side
of
forty
but
their
dress
was
that
of
young
girls
miss
doria
wymondham
was
tall
and
thin
with
a
mass
of
nondescript
pale
hair
confined
by
a
black
velvet
fillet
miss
claire
wymondham
was
shorter
and
plumper
and
had
done
her
best
by
cosmetics
to
make
herself
look
like
a
foreign
they
greeted
me
with
the
friendly
casualness
which
i
had
long
ago
discovered
was
the
right
english
manner
towards
your
guests
as
if
they
had
just
strolled
in
and
billeted
themselves
and
you
were
quite
glad
to
see
them
but
must
be
asked
to
trouble
yourself
further
the
next
second
they
were
cooing
like
pigeons
round
a
picture
which
a
young
man
was
holding
up
in
the
lamplight
he
was
a
tallish
lean
fellow
of
round
about
thirty
years
wearing
grey
flannels
and
shoes
dusty
from
the
country
roads
his
thin
face
was
sallow
as
if
from
living
indoors
and
he
had
rather
more
hair
on
his
head
than
most
of
us
in
the
glow
of
the
lamp
his
features
were
very
clear
and
i
examined
them
with
interest
for
remember
i
was
expecting
a
stranger
to
give
me
orders
he
had
a
long
rather
strong
chin
and
an
obstinate
mouth
with
peevish
lines
about
its
corners
but
the
remarkable
feature
was
his
eyes
i
can
best
describe
them
by
saying
that
they
looked
hot
not
fierce
or
angry
but
so
restless
that
they
seemed
to
ache
physically
and
to
want
sponging
with
cold
water
they
finished
their
talk
about
the
picture
which
was
couched
in
a
jargon
of
which
i
did
not
understand
one
word
and
miss
doria
turned
to
me
and
the
young
man
cousin
launcelot
wake
mr
brand
we
nodded
stiffly
and
mr
wake
hand
went
up
to
smooth
his
hair
in
a
gesture
barnard
announced
dinner
by
the
way
where
is
mary
came
in
five
minutes
ago
and
i
sent
her
to
change
said
miss
claire
wo
have
her
spoiling
the
evening
with
that
horrid
uniform
she
may
masquerade
as
she
likes
but
this
house
is
for
civilized
people
the
butler
appeared
and
mumbled
something
along
cried
miss
doria
i
sure
you
are
starving
mr
brand
and
launcelot
has
bicycled
ten
miles
the
was
very
unlike
the
hall
the
panelling
had
been
stripped
off
and
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
covered
with
a
satiny
paper
on
which
hung
the
most
monstrous
pictures
in
large
frames
i
could
only
see
them
dimly
but
they
seemed
to
be
a
mere
riot
of
ugly
colour
the
young
man
nodded
towards
them
see
you
have
got
the
degousses
hung
at
last
he
said
exquisite
they
are
cried
miss
claire
subtle
and
candid
and
brave
doria
and
i
warm
our
souls
at
their
flame
some
aromatic
wood
had
been
burned
in
the
room
and
there
was
a
queer
sickly
scent
about
everything
in
that
place
was
strained
and
uneasy
and
abnormal
the
candle
shades
on
the
table
the
mass
of
faked
china
fruit
in
the
centre
dish
the
gaudy
hangings
and
the
nightmarish
walls
but
the
food
was
magnificent
it
was
the
best
dinner
i
had
eaten
since
me
mr
brand
said
miss
doria
her
long
white
face
propped
on
a
hand
are
one
of
us
you
are
in
revolt
against
this
crazy
war
yes
i
said
remembering
my
part
think
a
little
would
settle
it
right
away
a
little
it
would
never
have
started
said
mr
wake
a
you
know
said
miss
doria
i
did
not
know
for
he
did
not
look
any
kind
of
soldier
i
was
just
about
to
ask
him
what
he
commanded
when
i
remembered
that
the
letters
stood
also
for
objector
and
stopped
in
time
at
that
moment
someone
slipped
into
the
vacant
seat
on
my
right
hand
i
turned
and
saw
the
girl
who
had
brought
tea
to
blaikie
that
afternoon
at
the
hospital
was
exempted
by
his
department
the
lady
went
on
he
a
civil
servant
and
so
he
never
had
a
chance
of
testifying
in
court
but
no
one
has
done
better
work
for
our
cause
he
is
on
the
committee
of
the
and
questions
have
been
asked
about
him
in
parliament
the
man
was
not
quite
comfortable
at
this
biography
he
glanced
nervously
at
me
and
was
going
to
begin
some
kind
of
explanation
when
miss
doria
cut
him
short
our
rule
launcelot
no
turgid
war
controversy
within
these
walls
i
agreed
with
her
the
war
had
seemed
closely
knit
to
the
summer
landscape
for
all
its
peace
and
to
the
noble
old
chambers
of
the
manor
but
in
that
demented
modish
it
was
shriekingly
incongruous
then
they
spoke
of
other
things
mostly
of
pictures
or
common
friends
and
a
little
of
books
they
paid
no
heed
to
me
which
was
fortunate
for
i
know
nothing
about
these
matters
and
did
understand
half
the
language
but
once
miss
doria
tried
to
bring
me
in
they
were
talking
about
some
russian
novel
a
name
like
leprous
souls
and
she
asked
me
if
i
had
read
it
by
a
curious
chance
i
had
it
had
drifted
somehow
into
our
on
the
scarpe
and
after
we
had
all
stuck
in
the
second
chapter
it
had
disappeared
in
the
mud
to
which
it
naturally
belonged
the
lady
praised
its
and
beauty
i
assented
and
congratulated
myself
on
my
second
escape
for
if
the
question
had
been
put
to
me
i
should
have
described
it
as
twaddle
i
turned
to
the
girl
who
welcomed
me
with
a
smile
i
had
thought
her
pretty
in
her
dress
but
now
in
a
filmy
black
gown
and
with
her
hair
no
longer
hidden
by
a
cap
she
was
the
most
ravishing
thing
you
ever
saw
and
i
observed
something
else
there
was
more
than
good
looks
in
her
young
face
her
broad
low
brow
and
her
laughing
eyes
were
amazingly
intelligent
she
had
an
uncanny
power
of
making
her
eyes
go
suddenly
grave
and
deep
like
a
glittering
river
narrowing
into
a
pool
shall
never
be
introduced
she
said
let
me
reveal
myself
mary
lamington
and
these
are
my
aunts
did
you
really
like
leprous
souls
it
was
easy
enough
to
talk
to
her
and
oddly
enough
her
mere
presence
took
away
the
oppression
i
had
felt
in
that
room
for
she
belonged
to
the
and
to
the
old
house
and
to
the
world
at
large
she
belonged
to
the
war
and
to
that
happier
world
beyond
it
a
world
which
must
be
won
by
going
through
the
struggle
and
not
by
shirking
it
like
those
two
silly
ladies
i
could
see
wake
eyes
often
on
the
girl
while
he
boomed
and
oraculated
and
the
misses
wymondham
prattled
presently
the
conversation
seemed
to
leave
the
flowery
paths
of
art
and
to
verge
perilously
near
forbidden
topics
he
began
to
abuse
our
generals
in
the
field
i
could
not
choose
but
listen
miss
lamington
brows
were
slightly
bent
as
if
in
disapproval
and
my
own
temper
began
to
rise
he
had
every
kind
of
idiotic
criticism
incompetence
corruption
where
he
got
the
stuff
i
ca
imagine
for
the
most
grousing
tommy
with
his
leave
stopped
never
put
together
such
balderdash
worst
of
all
he
asked
me
to
agree
with
him
it
took
all
my
sense
of
discipline
do
know
much
about
the
subject
i
said
out
in
south
africa
i
did
hear
that
the
british
leading
was
the
weak
point
i
expect
there
a
good
deal
in
what
you
say
it
may
have
been
fancy
but
the
girl
at
my
side
seemed
to
whisper
done
wake
and
i
did
not
remain
long
behind
before
joining
the
ladies
i
purposely
cut
it
short
for
i
was
in
mortal
fear
lest
i
should
lose
my
temper
and
spoil
everything
i
stood
up
with
my
back
against
the
mantelpiece
for
as
long
as
a
man
may
smoke
a
cigarette
and
i
let
him
yarn
to
me
while
i
looked
steadily
at
his
face
by
this
time
i
was
very
clear
that
wake
was
not
the
fellow
to
give
me
my
instructions
he
was
playing
a
game
he
was
a
perfectly
honest
crank
but
not
a
fanatic
for
he
was
sure
of
himself
he
had
somehow
lost
his
and
was
trying
to
argue
himself
back
into
it
he
had
considerable
brains
for
the
reasons
he
gave
for
differing
from
most
of
his
countrymen
were
good
so
far
as
they
went
i
should
have
cared
to
take
him
on
in
public
argument
if
you
had
told
me
about
such
a
fellow
a
week
before
i
should
have
been
sick
at
the
thought
of
him
but
now
i
did
dislike
him
i
was
bored
by
him
and
i
was
also
tremendously
sorry
for
him
you
could
see
he
was
as
restless
as
a
hen
when
we
went
back
to
the
hall
he
announced
that
he
must
get
on
the
road
and
commandeered
miss
lamington
to
help
him
find
his
bicycle
it
appeared
he
was
staying
at
an
inn
a
dozen
miles
off
for
a
couple
of
days
fishing
and
the
news
somehow
made
me
like
him
better
presently
the
ladies
of
the
house
departed
to
bed
for
their
beauty
sleep
and
i
was
left
to
my
own
devices
for
some
time
i
sat
smoking
in
the
hall
wondering
when
the
messenger
would
arrive
it
was
getting
late
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
preparation
in
the
house
to
receive
anybody
the
butler
came
in
with
a
tray
of
drinks
and
i
asked
him
if
he
expected
another
guest
that
night
of
it
sir
was
his
answer
been
a
telegram
that
i
know
of
and
i
received
no
instructions
i
lit
my
pipe
and
sat
for
twenty
minutes
reading
a
weekly
paper
then
i
got
up
and
looked
at
the
family
portraits
the
moon
coming
through
the
lattice
invited
me
as
a
cure
for
my
anxiety
it
was
after
eleven
and
i
was
still
without
any
knowledge
of
my
next
step
it
is
a
maddening
business
to
be
screwed
up
for
an
unpleasant
job
and
to
have
the
wheels
of
the
confounded
thing
tarry
outside
the
house
beyond
a
flagged
terrace
the
lawn
fell
away
white
in
the
moonshine
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
which
here
had
expanded
into
a
miniature
lake
by
the
water
edge
was
a
little
formal
garden
with
grey
stone
parapets
which
now
gleamed
like
dusky
marble
great
wafts
of
scent
rose
from
it
for
the
lilacs
were
scarcely
over
and
the
may
was
in
full
blossom
out
from
the
shade
of
it
came
suddenly
a
voice
like
a
nightingale
it
was
singing
the
old
song
ripe
a
common
enough
thing
which
i
had
chiefly
known
from
but
heard
in
the
scented
moonlight
it
seemed
to
hold
all
the
lingering
magic
of
an
elder
england
and
of
this
hallowed
countryside
i
stepped
inside
the
garden
bounds
and
saw
the
head
of
the
girl
mary
she
was
conscious
of
my
presence
for
she
turned
towards
me
was
coming
to
look
for
you
she
said
that
the
house
is
quiet
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
general
hannay
she
knew
my
name
and
must
be
somehow
in
the
business
the
thought
entranced
me
god
i
can
speak
to
you
freely
i
cried
and
what
are
you
living
in
that
house
in
that
kind
of
company
good
aunts
she
laughed
softly
talk
a
great
deal
about
their
souls
but
they
really
mean
their
nerves
why
they
are
what
you
call
my
camouflage
and
a
very
good
one
too
that
cadaverous
young
prig
launcelot
yes
camouflage
too
perhaps
something
a
little
more
you
must
not
judge
him
too
harshly
but
i
did
not
know
how
to
put
it
and
stammered
in
my
eagerness
can
i
tell
that
you
are
the
right
person
for
me
to
speak
to
you
see
i
am
under
orders
and
i
have
got
none
about
you
will
give
you
proof
she
said
days
ago
sir
walter
bullivant
and
mr
macgillivray
told
you
to
come
here
tonight
and
to
wait
here
for
further
instructions
you
met
them
in
the
little
at
the
back
of
the
rota
club
you
were
bidden
take
the
name
of
cornelius
brand
and
turn
yourself
from
a
successful
general
into
a
pacifist
south
african
engineer
is
that
correct
have
been
restless
all
evening
looking
for
the
messenger
to
give
you
these
instructions
set
your
mind
at
ease
no
messenger
is
coming
you
will
get
your
orders
from
me
could
not
take
them
from
a
more
welcome
source
i
said
prettily
put
if
you
want
further
credentials
i
can
tell
you
much
about
your
own
doings
in
the
past
three
years
i
can
explain
to
you
who
do
need
the
explanation
every
step
in
the
business
of
the
black
stone
i
think
i
could
draw
a
pretty
accurate
map
of
your
journey
to
erzerum
you
have
a
letter
from
peter
pienaar
in
your
pocket
i
can
tell
you
its
contents
are
you
willing
to
trust
me
all
my
heart
i
said
then
my
first
order
will
try
you
pretty
hard
for
i
have
no
orders
to
give
you
except
to
bid
you
go
and
steep
yourself
in
a
particular
kind
of
life
your
first
duty
is
to
get
atmosphere
as
your
friend
peter
used
to
say
oh
i
will
tell
you
where
to
go
and
how
to
behave
but
i
ca
bid
you
do
anything
only
live
idly
with
open
eyes
and
ears
till
you
have
got
the
feel
of
the
situation
she
stopped
and
laid
a
hand
on
my
arm
wo
be
easy
it
would
madden
me
and
it
will
be
a
far
heavier
burden
for
a
man
like
you
you
have
got
to
sink
down
deep
into
the
life
of
the
the
people
whom
this
war
has
touched
or
has
touched
in
the
wrong
way
the
people
who
split
hairs
all
day
and
are
engrossed
in
what
you
and
i
would
call
selfish
little
fads
yes
people
like
my
aunts
and
launcelot
only
for
the
most
part
in
a
different
social
grade
you
wo
live
in
an
old
manor
like
this
but
among
gimcrack
little
arty
houses
you
will
hear
everything
you
regard
as
sacred
laughed
at
and
condemned
and
every
kind
of
nauseous
folly
acclaimed
and
you
must
hold
your
tongue
and
pretend
to
agree
you
will
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
except
to
let
the
life
soak
into
you
and
as
i
have
said
keep
your
eyes
and
ears
open
you
must
give
me
some
clue
as
to
what
i
should
be
looking
for
orders
are
to
give
you
none
our
chiefs
yours
and
mine
want
you
to
go
where
you
are
going
without
any
kind
of
remember
we
are
still
in
the
intelligence
stage
of
the
affair
the
time
has
yet
come
for
a
plan
of
campaign
and
still
less
for
action
me
one
thing
i
said
it
a
really
big
thing
we
after
really
big
thing
she
said
slowly
and
very
gravely
and
i
and
some
hundred
others
are
hunting
the
most
dangerous
man
in
all
the
world
till
we
succeed
everything
that
britain
does
is
crippled
if
we
fail
or
succeed
too
late
the
allies
may
never
win
the
victory
which
is
their
right
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
to
cheer
you
it
is
in
some
sort
a
race
against
time
so
your
purgatory
wo
endure
too
long
i
was
bound
to
obey
and
she
knew
it
for
she
took
my
willingness
for
granted
from
a
little
gold
satchel
she
selected
a
tiny
box
and
opening
it
extracted
a
thing
like
a
purple
wafer
with
a
white
st
andrew
cross
on
it
kind
of
watch
have
you
ah
a
hunter
paste
that
inside
the
lid
some
day
you
may
be
called
on
to
show
it
one
other
thing
buy
tomorrow
a
copy
of
the
and
get
it
by
heart
you
will
receive
letters
and
messages
some
day
and
the
style
of
our
friends
is
apt
to
be
reminiscent
of
john
bunyan
the
car
will
be
at
the
door
tomorrow
to
catch
the
and
i
will
give
you
the
address
of
the
rooms
that
have
been
taken
for
you
beyond
that
i
have
nothing
to
say
except
to
beg
you
to
play
the
part
well
and
keep
your
temper
you
behaved
very
nicely
at
dinner
i
asked
one
last
question
as
we
said
good
night
in
the
hall
i
see
you
again
and
often
was
the
answer
we
are
colleagues
i
went
upstairs
feeling
extraordinarily
comforted
i
had
a
perfectly
beastly
time
ahead
of
me
but
now
it
was
all
glorified
and
coloured
with
the
thought
of
the
girl
who
had
sung
ripe
in
the
garden
i
commended
the
wisdom
of
that
old
serpent
bullivant
in
the
choice
of
his
intermediary
for
i
hanged
if
i
would
have
taken
such
orders
from
anyone
else
chapter
two
village
named
up
on
the
high
veld
our
rivers
are
apt
to
be
strings
of
pools
linked
by
muddy
trickles
the
most
stagnant
kind
of
watercourse
you
would
look
for
in
a
day
journey
but
presently
they
reach
the
edge
of
the
plateau
and
are
tossed
down
into
the
flats
in
noble
ravines
and
roll
thereafter
in
full
and
sounding
currents
to
the
sea
so
with
the
story
i
am
telling
it
began
in
smooth
reaches
as
idle
as
a
yet
the
day
soon
came
when
i
was
in
the
grip
of
a
torrent
flung
breathless
from
rock
to
rock
by
a
destiny
which
i
could
not
control
but
for
the
present
i
was
in
a
backwater
no
less
than
the
garden
city
of
biggleswick
where
mr
cornelius
brand
a
south
african
gentleman
visiting
england
on
holiday
lodged
in
a
pair
of
rooms
in
the
cottage
of
mr
tancred
jimson
the
house
or
as
they
preferred
to
name
it
at
biggleswick
was
one
of
some
two
hundred
others
which
ringed
a
pleasant
midland
common
it
was
badly
built
and
oddly
furnished
the
bed
was
too
short
the
windows
did
not
fit
the
doors
did
not
stay
shut
but
it
was
as
clean
as
soap
and
water
and
scrubbing
could
make
it
the
of
an
acre
of
garden
were
mainly
devoted
to
the
culture
of
potatoes
though
under
the
parlour
window
mrs
jimson
had
a
plot
of
herbs
and
lines
of
lank
sunflowers
fringed
the
path
that
led
to
the
front
door
it
was
mrs
jimson
who
received
me
as
i
descended
from
the
station
fly
a
large
red
woman
with
hair
bleached
by
constant
exposure
to
weather
clad
in
a
gown
which
both
in
shape
and
material
seemed
to
have
been
modelled
on
a
chintz
curtain
she
was
a
good
kindly
soul
and
as
proud
as
punch
of
her
house
follow
the
simple
life
here
mr
brand
she
said
must
take
us
as
you
find
us
i
assured
her
that
i
asked
for
nothing
better
and
as
i
unpacked
in
my
fresh
little
bedroom
with
a
west
wind
blowing
in
at
the
window
i
considered
that
i
had
seen
worse
quarters
i
had
bought
in
london
a
considerable
number
of
books
for
i
thought
that
as
i
would
have
time
on
my
hands
i
might
as
well
do
something
about
my
education
they
were
mostly
english
classics
whose
names
i
knew
but
which
i
had
never
read
and
they
were
all
in
a
little
series
at
a
shilling
apiece
i
arranged
them
on
top
of
a
chest
of
drawers
but
i
kept
the
beside
my
bed
for
that
was
one
of
my
working
tools
and
i
had
got
to
get
it
by
heart
mrs
jimson
who
came
in
while
i
was
unpacking
to
see
if
the
room
was
to
my
liking
approved
my
taste
at
our
midday
dinner
she
wanted
to
discuss
books
with
me
and
was
so
full
of
her
own
knowledge
that
i
was
able
to
conceal
my
ignorance
are
all
labouring
to
express
our
personalities
she
informed
me
you
found
your
medium
mr
brand
is
it
to
be
the
pen
or
the
pencil
or
perhaps
it
is
music
you
have
the
brow
of
an
artist
the
frontal
bar
of
michelangelo
you
remember
i
told
her
that
i
concluded
i
would
try
literature
but
before
writing
anything
i
would
read
a
bit
more
it
was
a
saturday
so
jimson
came
back
from
town
in
the
early
afternoon
he
was
a
managing
clerk
in
some
shipping
office
but
you
would
have
guessed
it
from
his
appearance
his
city
clothes
were
loose
flannels
a
soft
collar
an
orange
tie
and
a
soft
black
hat
his
wife
went
down
the
road
to
meet
him
and
they
returned
swinging
their
arms
like
a
couple
of
schoolchildren
he
had
a
skimpy
red
beard
streaked
with
grey
and
mild
blue
eyes
behind
strong
glasses
he
was
the
most
friendly
creature
in
the
world
full
of
rapid
questions
and
eager
to
make
me
feel
one
of
the
family
presently
he
got
into
a
tweed
norfolk
jacket
and
started
to
cultivate
his
garden
i
took
off
my
coat
and
lent
him
a
hand
and
when
he
stopped
to
rest
from
his
labours
which
was
every
five
minutes
for
he
had
no
kind
of
physique
he
would
mop
his
brow
and
rub
his
spectacles
and
declaim
about
the
good
smell
of
the
earth
and
the
joy
of
getting
close
to
nature
once
he
looked
at
my
big
brown
hands
and
muscular
arms
with
a
kind
of
wistfulness
are
one
of
the
doers
mr
brand
he
said
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
envy
you
you
have
seen
nature
in
wild
forms
in
far
countries
some
day
i
hope
you
will
tell
us
about
your
life
i
must
be
content
with
my
little
corner
but
happily
there
are
no
territorial
limits
for
the
mind
this
modest
dwelling
is
a
from
which
i
look
over
all
the
world
after
that
he
took
me
for
a
walk
we
met
parties
of
returning
and
here
and
there
a
golfer
there
seemed
to
be
an
abundance
of
young
men
mostly
rather
but
with
one
or
two
ones
who
should
have
been
fighting
the
names
of
some
of
them
jimson
mentioned
with
awe
an
unwholesome
youth
was
aronson
the
great
novelist
a
sturdy
bristling
fellow
with
a
fierce
moustache
was
letchford
the
celebrated
of
the
critic
several
were
pointed
out
to
me
as
artists
who
had
gone
one
better
than
anybody
else
and
a
vast
billowy
creature
was
described
as
the
leader
of
the
new
orientalism
in
england
i
noticed
that
these
people
according
to
jimson
were
all
and
that
they
all
dabbled
in
something
there
were
quantities
of
young
women
too
most
of
them
rather
badly
dressed
and
inclining
to
untidy
hair
and
there
were
several
decent
couples
taking
the
air
like
of
an
evening
all
the
world
over
most
of
these
last
were
jimson
friends
to
whom
he
introduced
me
they
were
his
own
class
modest
folk
who
sought
for
a
coloured
background
to
their
prosaic
city
lives
and
found
it
in
this
odd
settlement
at
supper
i
was
initiated
into
the
peculiar
merits
of
biggleswick
is
one
great
laboratory
of
thought
said
mrs
jimson
is
glorious
to
feel
that
you
are
living
among
the
eager
vital
people
who
are
at
the
head
of
all
the
newest
movements
and
that
the
intellectual
history
of
england
is
being
made
in
our
studies
and
gardens
the
war
to
us
seems
a
remote
and
secondary
affair
as
someone
has
said
the
great
fights
of
the
world
are
all
fought
in
the
mind
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
her
husband
face
wish
i
could
feel
it
far
away
after
all
ursula
it
is
the
sacrifice
of
the
young
that
gives
people
like
us
leisure
and
peace
to
think
our
duty
is
to
do
the
best
which
is
permitted
to
us
but
that
duty
is
a
poor
thing
compared
with
what
our
young
soldiers
are
giving
i
may
be
quite
wrong
about
the
war
i
know
i
ca
argue
with
letchford
but
i
will
not
pretend
to
a
superiority
i
do
not
feel
i
went
to
bed
feeling
that
in
jimson
i
had
struck
a
pretty
sound
fellow
as
i
lit
the
candles
on
my
i
observed
that
the
stack
of
silver
which
i
had
taken
out
of
my
pockets
when
i
washed
before
supper
was
it
had
two
big
coins
at
the
top
and
sixpences
and
shillings
beneath
now
it
is
one
of
my
oddities
that
ever
since
i
was
a
small
boy
i
have
arranged
my
loose
coins
symmetrically
with
the
smallest
uppermost
that
made
me
observant
and
led
me
to
notice
a
second
point
the
english
classics
on
the
top
of
the
chest
of
drawers
were
not
in
the
order
i
had
left
them
izaak
walton
had
got
to
the
left
of
sir
thomas
browne
and
the
poet
burns
was
wedged
disconsolately
between
two
volumes
of
hazlitt
moreover
a
receipted
bill
which
i
had
stuck
in
the
to
mark
my
place
had
been
moved
someone
had
been
going
through
my
belongings
a
moment
reflection
convinced
me
that
it
could
have
been
mrs
jimson
she
had
no
servant
and
did
the
housework
herself
but
my
things
had
been
untouched
when
i
left
the
room
before
supper
for
she
had
come
to
tidy
up
before
i
had
gone
downstairs
someone
had
been
here
while
we
were
at
supper
and
had
examined
elaborately
everything
i
possessed
happily
i
had
little
luggage
and
no
papers
save
the
new
books
and
a
bill
or
two
in
the
name
of
cornelius
brand
the
inquisitor
whoever
he
was
had
found
nothing
the
incident
gave
me
a
good
deal
of
comfort
it
had
been
hard
to
believe
that
any
mystery
could
exist
in
this
public
place
where
people
lived
brazenly
in
the
open
and
wore
their
hearts
on
their
sleeves
and
proclaimed
their
opinions
from
the
rooftops
yet
mystery
there
must
be
or
an
inoffensive
stranger
with
a
would
not
have
received
these
strange
attentions
i
made
a
practice
after
that
of
sleeping
with
my
watch
below
my
pillow
for
inside
the
case
was
mary
lamington
label
now
began
a
period
of
pleasant
idle
receptiveness
once
a
week
it
was
my
custom
to
go
up
to
london
for
the
day
to
receive
letters
and
instructions
if
any
should
come
i
had
moved
from
my
chambers
in
park
lane
which
i
leased
under
my
proper
name
to
a
small
flat
in
westminster
taken
in
the
name
of
cornelius
brand
the
letters
addressed
to
park
lane
were
forwarded
to
sir
walter
who
sent
them
round
under
cover
to
my
new
address
for
the
rest
i
used
to
spend
my
mornings
reading
in
the
garden
and
i
discovered
for
the
first
time
what
a
pleasure
was
to
be
got
from
old
books
they
recalled
and
amplified
that
vision
i
had
seen
from
the
cotswold
ridge
the
revelation
of
the
priceless
heritage
which
is
england
i
imbibed
a
mighty
quantity
of
history
but
especially
i
liked
the
writers
like
walton
who
got
at
the
very
heart
of
the
english
countryside
soon
too
i
found
the
not
a
duty
but
a
delight
i
discovered
new
jewels
daily
in
the
honest
old
story
and
my
letters
to
peter
began
to
be
as
full
of
it
as
peter
own
epistles
i
loved
also
the
songs
of
the
elizabethans
for
they
reminded
me
of
the
girl
who
had
sung
to
me
in
the
june
night
in
the
afternoons
i
took
my
exercise
in
long
tramps
along
the
good
dusty
english
roads
the
country
fell
away
from
biggleswick
into
a
plain
of
wood
and
with
low
hills
on
the
horizon
the
place
was
sown
with
villages
each
with
its
green
and
pond
and
ancient
church
most
too
had
inns
and
there
i
had
many
a
draught
of
cool
nutty
ale
for
the
inn
at
biggleswick
was
a
reformed
place
which
sold
nothing
but
washy
cider
often
tramping
home
in
the
dusk
i
was
so
much
in
love
with
the
land
that
i
could
have
sung
with
the
pure
joy
of
it
and
in
the
evening
after
a
bath
there
would
be
supper
when
a
rather
fagged
jimson
struggled
between
sleep
and
hunger
and
the
lady
with
an
artistic
mutch
on
her
untidy
head
talked
ruthlessly
of
culture
bit
by
bit
i
edged
my
way
into
local
society
the
jimsons
were
a
great
help
for
they
were
popular
and
had
a
nodding
acquaintance
with
most
of
the
inhabitants
they
regarded
me
as
a
meritorious
aspirant
towards
a
higher
life
and
i
was
paraded
before
their
friends
with
the
suggestion
of
a
vivid
if
philistine
past
if
i
had
any
gift
for
writing
i
would
make
a
book
about
the
inhabitants
of
biggleswick
about
half
were
respectable
citizens
who
came
there
for
country
air
and
low
rates
but
even
these
had
a
touch
of
queerness
and
had
picked
up
the
jargon
of
the
place
the
younger
men
were
mostly
government
clerks
or
writers
or
artists
there
were
a
few
widows
with
flocks
of
daughters
and
on
the
outskirts
were
several
bigger
houses
mostly
houses
which
had
been
there
before
the
garden
city
was
planted
one
of
them
was
a
staring
villa
with
timbering
stuck
on
the
top
of
a
hill
among
raw
gardens
it
belonged
to
a
man
called
moxon
ivery
who
was
a
kind
of
academic
pacificist
and
a
great
god
in
the
place
another
a
quiet
georgian
manor
house
was
owned
by
a
london
publisher
an
ardent
liberal
whose
particular
branch
of
business
compelled
him
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
new
movements
i
used
to
see
him
hurrying
to
the
station
swinging
a
little
black
bag
and
returning
at
night
with
the
fish
for
dinner
i
soon
got
to
know
a
surprising
lot
of
people
and
they
were
the
rummiest
birds
you
can
imagine
for
example
there
were
the
weekeses
three
girls
who
lived
with
their
mother
in
a
house
so
artistic
that
you
broke
your
head
whichever
way
you
turned
in
it
the
son
of
the
family
was
a
conscientious
objector
who
had
refused
to
do
any
sort
of
work
whatever
and
had
got
quodded
for
his
pains
they
were
immensely
proud
of
him
and
used
to
relate
his
sufferings
in
dartmoor
with
a
gusto
which
i
thought
rather
heartless
art
was
their
great
subject
and
i
am
afraid
they
found
me
pretty
heavy
going
it
was
their
fashion
never
to
admire
anything
that
was
obviously
beautiful
like
a
sunset
or
a
pretty
woman
but
to
find
surprising
loveliness
in
things
which
i
thought
hideous
also
they
talked
a
language
that
was
beyond
me
this
kind
of
conversation
used
to
miss
weekes
you
admire
ursula
jimson
self
miss
is
so
in
her
lines
self
miss
tancred
too
he
is
so
full
of
nuances
self
miss
suggests
one
of
degousse
countrymen
self
they
had
much
use
for
books
except
some
russian
ones
and
i
acquired
merit
in
their
eyes
for
having
read
leprous
souls
if
you
talked
to
them
about
that
divine
countryside
you
found
they
give
a
rap
for
it
and
had
never
been
a
mile
beyond
the
village
but
they
admired
greatly
the
sombre
effect
of
a
train
going
into
marylebone
station
on
a
rainy
day
but
it
was
the
men
who
interested
me
most
aronson
the
novelist
proved
on
acquaintance
the
worst
kind
of
blighter
he
considered
himself
a
genius
whom
it
was
the
duty
of
the
country
to
support
and
he
sponged
on
his
wretched
relatives
and
anyone
who
would
lend
him
money
he
was
always
babbling
about
his
sins
and
pretty
squalid
they
were
i
should
like
to
have
flung
him
among
a
few
good
sinners
of
my
acquaintance
they
would
have
scared
him
considerably
he
told
me
that
he
sought
and
and
but
it
was
hard
to
see
how
he
could
know
much
about
them
for
he
spent
half
the
day
in
bed
smoking
cheap
cigarettes
and
the
rest
sunning
himself
in
the
admiration
of
girls
the
creature
was
tuberculous
in
mind
and
body
and
the
only
novel
of
his
i
read
pretty
well
turned
my
stomach
mr
aronson
strong
point
was
jokes
about
the
war
if
he
heard
of
any
acquaintance
who
had
joined
up
or
was
even
doing
war
work
his
merriment
knew
no
bounds
my
fingers
used
to
itch
to
box
the
little
wretch
ears
letchford
was
a
different
pair
of
shoes
he
was
some
kind
of
a
man
to
begin
with
and
had
an
excellent
brain
and
the
worst
manners
conceivable
he
contradicted
everything
you
said
and
looked
out
for
an
argument
as
other
people
look
for
their
dinner
he
was
a
pacificist
because
he
was
the
kind
of
cantankerous
fellow
who
must
always
be
in
a
minority
if
britain
had
stood
out
of
the
war
he
would
have
been
a
raving
militarist
but
since
she
was
in
it
he
had
got
to
find
reasons
why
she
was
wrong
and
jolly
good
reasons
they
were
too
i
could
have
met
his
arguments
if
i
had
wanted
to
so
i
sat
docilely
at
his
feet
the
world
was
all
crooked
for
letchford
and
god
had
created
him
with
two
left
hands
but
the
fellow
had
merits
he
had
a
couple
of
jolly
children
whom
he
adored
and
he
would
walk
miles
with
me
on
a
sunday
and
spout
poetry
about
the
beauty
and
greatness
of
england
he
was
if
he
had
been
thirty
and
in
my
battalion
i
could
have
made
a
soldier
out
of
him
there
were
dozens
more
whose
names
i
have
forgotten
but
they
had
one
common
characteristic
they
were
puffed
up
with
spiritual
pride
and
i
used
to
amuse
myself
with
finding
their
originals
in
the
when
i
tried
to
judge
them
by
the
standard
of
old
peter
they
fell
woefully
short
they
shut
out
the
war
from
their
lives
some
out
of
funk
some
out
of
pure
levity
of
mind
and
some
because
they
were
really
convinced
that
the
thing
was
all
wrong
i
think
i
grew
rather
popular
in
my
role
of
the
seeker
after
truth
the
honest
colonial
who
was
against
the
war
by
instinct
and
was
looking
for
instruction
in
the
matter
they
regarded
me
as
a
convert
from
an
alien
world
of
action
which
they
secretly
dreaded
though
they
affected
to
despise
it
anyhow
they
talked
to
me
very
freely
and
before
long
i
had
all
the
pacifist
arguments
by
heart
i
made
out
that
there
were
three
schools
one
objected
to
war
altogether
and
this
had
few
adherents
except
aronson
and
weekes
now
languishing
in
dartmoor
the
second
thought
that
the
allies
cause
was
tainted
and
that
britain
had
contributed
as
much
as
germany
to
the
catastrophe
this
included
all
the
adherents
of
the
or
league
of
democrats
against
aggression
a
very
proud
body
the
third
and
much
the
largest
which
embraced
everybody
else
held
that
we
had
fought
long
enough
and
that
the
business
could
now
be
settled
by
negotiation
since
germany
had
learned
her
lesson
i
was
myself
a
modest
member
of
the
last
school
but
i
was
gradually
working
my
way
up
to
the
second
and
i
hoped
with
luck
to
qualify
for
the
first
my
acquaintances
approved
my
progress
letchford
said
i
had
a
core
of
fanaticism
in
my
slow
nature
and
that
i
would
end
by
waving
the
red
flag
spiritual
pride
and
vanity
as
i
have
said
were
at
the
bottom
of
most
of
them
and
try
as
i
might
i
could
find
nothing
very
dangerous
in
it
all
this
vexed
me
for
i
began
to
wonder
if
the
mission
which
i
had
embarked
on
so
solemnly
were
not
going
to
be
a
fiasco
sometimes
they
worried
me
beyond
endurance
when
the
news
of
messines
came
nobody
took
the
slightest
interest
while
i
was
aching
to
tooth
every
detail
of
the
great
fight
and
when
they
talked
on
military
affairs
as
letchford
and
others
did
sometimes
it
was
difficult
to
keep
from
sending
them
all
to
the
devil
for
their
amateur
cocksureness
would
have
riled
job
one
had
got
to
batten
down
the
recollection
of
our
fellows
out
there
who
were
sweating
blood
to
keep
these
fools
snug
yet
i
found
it
impossible
to
be
angry
with
them
for
long
they
were
so
babyishly
innocent
indeed
i
could
help
liking
them
and
finding
a
sort
of
quality
in
them
i
had
spent
three
years
among
soldiers
and
the
british
regular
great
follow
that
he
is
has
his
faults
his
discipline
makes
him
in
a
funk
of
and
any
kind
of
superior
authority
now
these
people
were
quite
honest
and
in
a
perverted
way
courageous
letchford
was
at
any
rate
i
could
no
more
have
done
what
he
did
and
got
hunted
off
platforms
by
the
crowd
and
hooted
at
by
women
in
the
streets
than
i
could
have
written
his
leading
articles
all
the
same
i
was
rather
low
about
my
job
barring
the
episode
of
the
ransacking
of
my
effects
the
first
night
i
had
not
a
suspicion
of
a
clue
or
a
hint
of
any
mystery
the
place
and
the
people
were
as
open
and
bright
as
a
hut
but
one
day
i
got
a
solid
wad
of
comfort
in
a
corner
of
letchford
paper
the
i
found
a
letter
which
was
one
of
the
steepest
pieces
of
invective
i
had
ever
met
with
the
writer
gave
tongue
like
a
beagle
pup
about
the
prostitution
as
he
called
it
of
american
republicanism
to
the
vices
of
european
aristocracies
he
declared
that
senator
la
follette
was
a
patriot
seeing
that
he
alone
spoke
for
the
toiling
millions
who
had
no
other
friend
he
was
mad
with
president
wilson
and
he
prophesied
a
great
awakening
when
uncle
sam
got
up
against
john
bull
in
europe
and
found
out
the
kind
of
standpatter
he
was
the
letter
was
signed
blenkiron
and
dated
july
the
thought
that
blenkiron
was
in
england
put
a
new
complexion
on
my
business
i
reckoned
i
would
see
him
soon
for
he
was
the
man
to
stand
still
in
his
tracks
he
had
taken
up
the
role
he
had
played
before
he
left
in
december
and
very
right
too
for
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
people
knew
of
the
erzerum
affair
and
to
the
british
public
he
was
only
the
man
who
had
been
fired
out
of
the
savoy
for
talking
treason
i
had
felt
a
bit
lonely
before
but
now
somewhere
within
the
four
corners
of
the
island
the
best
companion
god
ever
made
was
writing
nonsense
with
his
tongue
in
his
old
cheek
there
was
an
institution
in
biggleswick
which
deserves
mention
on
the
south
of
the
common
near
the
station
stood
a
building
called
the
moot
hall
which
was
a
kind
of
church
for
the
very
undevout
population
undevout
in
the
ordinary
sense
i
mean
for
i
had
already
counted
varieties
of
religious
conviction
including
three
buddhists
a
celestial
hierarch
five
saints
and
about
ten
varieties
of
mystic
whose
names
i
could
never
remember
the
hall
had
been
the
gift
of
the
publisher
i
have
spoken
of
and
twice
a
week
it
was
used
for
lectures
and
debates
the
place
was
managed
by
a
committee
and
was
surprisingly
popular
for
it
gave
all
the
bubbling
intellects
a
chance
of
airing
their
views
when
you
asked
where
somebody
was
and
were
told
he
was
moot
the
answer
was
spoken
in
the
respectful
tone
in
which
you
would
mention
a
sacrament
i
went
there
regularly
and
got
my
mind
broadened
to
cracking
point
we
had
all
the
stars
of
the
new
movements
we
had
doctor
chirk
who
lectured
on
which
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
was
a
new
name
he
had
invented
for
himself
there
was
a
woman
a
terrible
woman
who
had
come
back
from
russia
with
what
she
called
a
of
healing
and
to
my
joy
one
night
there
was
a
great
buck
nigger
who
had
a
lot
to
say
about
for
the
africans
i
had
a
few
words
with
him
in
sesutu
afterwards
and
rather
spoiled
his
visit
some
of
the
people
were
extraordinarily
good
especially
one
jolly
old
fellow
who
talked
about
english
folk
songs
and
dances
and
wanted
us
to
set
up
a
maypole
in
the
debates
which
generally
followed
i
began
to
join
very
coyly
at
first
but
presently
with
some
confidence
if
my
time
at
biggleswick
did
nothing
else
it
taught
me
to
argue
on
my
feet
the
first
big
effort
i
made
was
on
a
occasion
when
launcelot
wake
came
down
to
speak
mr
ivery
was
in
the
chair
the
first
i
had
seen
of
him
a
plump
man
with
a
colourless
face
and
nondescript
features
i
was
not
interested
in
him
till
he
began
to
talk
and
then
i
sat
bolt
upright
and
took
notice
for
he
was
the
genuine
the
sentences
flowing
from
his
mouth
as
smooth
as
butter
and
as
neatly
dovetailed
as
a
parquet
floor
he
had
a
sort
of
manner
treating
his
opponents
with
condescending
geniality
deprecating
all
passion
and
exaggeration
and
making
you
feel
that
his
urbane
statement
must
be
right
for
if
he
had
wanted
he
could
have
put
the
case
so
much
higher
i
watched
him
fascinated
studying
his
face
carefully
and
the
thing
that
struck
me
was
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
nothing
that
is
to
say
to
lay
hold
on
it
was
simply
nondescript
so
almightily
commonplace
that
that
very
fact
made
it
rather
remarkable
wake
was
speaking
of
the
revelations
of
the
sukhomhnov
trial
in
russia
which
showed
that
germany
had
not
been
responsible
for
the
war
he
was
jolly
good
at
the
job
and
put
as
clear
an
argument
as
a
lawyer
i
had
been
sweating
away
at
the
subject
and
had
all
the
ordinary
case
at
my
fingers
ends
so
when
i
got
a
chance
of
speaking
i
gave
them
a
long
harangue
with
some
good
quotations
i
had
cribbed
out
of
the
which
letchford
lent
me
i
felt
it
was
up
to
me
to
be
extra
violent
for
i
wanted
to
establish
my
character
with
wake
seeing
that
he
was
a
friend
of
mary
and
mary
would
know
that
i
was
playing
the
game
i
got
tremendously
applauded
far
more
than
the
chief
speaker
and
after
the
meeting
wake
came
up
to
me
with
his
hot
eyes
and
wrung
my
hand
coming
on
well
brand
he
said
and
then
he
introduced
me
to
mr
ivery
a
second
and
a
better
smuts
he
said
ivery
made
me
walk
a
bit
of
the
road
home
with
him
am
struck
by
your
grip
on
these
difficult
problems
mr
brand
he
told
me
is
much
i
can
tell
you
and
you
may
be
of
great
value
to
our
cause
he
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
about
my
past
which
i
answered
with
easy
mendacity
before
we
parted
he
made
me
promise
to
come
one
night
to
supper
next
day
i
got
a
glimpse
of
mary
and
to
my
vexation
she
cut
me
dead
she
was
walking
with
a
flock
of
girls
all
chattering
hard
and
though
she
saw
me
quite
plainly
she
turned
away
her
eyes
i
had
been
waiting
for
my
cue
so
i
did
not
lift
my
hat
but
passed
on
as
if
we
were
strangers
i
reckoned
it
was
part
of
the
game
but
that
trifling
thing
annoyed
me
and
i
spent
a
morose
evening
the
following
day
i
saw
her
again
this
time
talking
sedately
with
mr
ivery
and
dressed
in
a
very
pretty
summer
gown
and
a
straw
hat
with
flowers
in
it
this
time
she
stopped
with
a
bright
smile
and
held
out
her
hand
brand
is
it
she
asked
with
a
pretty
hesitation
and
then
turning
to
her
companion
is
mr
brand
he
stayed
with
us
last
month
in
gloucestershire
mr
ivery
announced
that
he
and
i
were
already
acquainted
seen
in
broad
daylight
he
was
a
very
personable
fellow
somewhere
between
and
fifty
with
a
figure
and
a
curiously
young
face
i
noticed
that
there
were
hardly
any
lines
on
it
and
it
was
rather
that
of
a
very
wise
child
than
that
of
a
man
he
had
a
pleasant
smile
which
made
his
jaw
and
cheeks
expand
like
indiarubber
are
coming
to
sup
with
me
mr
brand
he
cried
after
me
tuesday
after
moot
i
have
already
written
he
whisked
mary
away
from
me
and
i
had
to
content
myself
with
contemplating
her
figure
till
it
disappeared
round
a
bend
of
the
road
next
day
in
london
i
found
a
letter
from
peter
he
had
been
very
solemn
of
late
and
very
reminiscent
of
old
days
now
that
he
concluded
his
active
life
was
over
but
this
time
he
was
in
a
different
mood
think
he
wrote
you
and
i
will
meet
again
soon
my
old
friend
do
you
remember
when
we
went
after
the
big
lion
in
the
rooirand
and
could
get
on
his
track
and
then
one
morning
we
woke
up
and
said
we
would
get
him
today
and
we
did
but
he
very
near
got
you
first
i
had
a
feel
these
last
days
that
we
both
going
down
into
the
valley
to
meet
with
apolyon
and
that
the
devil
will
give
us
a
bad
time
but
anyhow
we
be
i
had
the
same
kind
of
feel
myself
though
i
did
see
how
peter
and
i
were
going
to
meet
unless
i
went
out
to
the
front
again
and
got
put
in
the
bag
and
sent
to
the
same
boche
prison
but
i
had
an
instinct
that
my
time
in
biggleswick
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
that
presently
i
would
be
in
rougher
quarters
i
felt
quite
affectionate
towards
the
place
and
took
all
my
favourite
walks
and
drank
my
own
health
in
the
brew
of
the
village
inns
with
a
consciousness
of
saying
goodbye
also
i
made
haste
to
finish
my
english
classics
for
i
concluded
i
have
much
time
in
the
future
for
miscellaneous
reading
the
tuesday
came
and
in
the
evening
i
set
out
rather
late
for
the
moot
hall
for
i
had
been
getting
into
decent
clothes
after
a
long
hot
stride
when
i
reached
the
place
it
was
pretty
well
packed
and
i
could
only
find
a
seat
on
the
back
benches
there
on
the
platform
was
ivery
and
beside
him
sat
a
figure
that
thrilled
every
inch
of
me
with
affection
and
a
wild
anticipation
have
now
the
privilege
said
the
chairman
introducing
to
you
the
speaker
whom
we
so
warmly
welcome
our
fearless
and
indefatigable
american
friend
mr
blenkiron
it
was
the
old
blenkiron
but
almightily
changed
his
stoutness
had
gone
and
he
was
as
lean
as
abraham
lincoln
instead
of
a
puffy
face
his
and
jaw
stood
out
hard
and
sharp
and
in
place
of
his
former
pasty
colour
his
complexion
had
the
clear
glow
of
health
i
saw
now
that
he
was
a
splendid
figure
of
a
man
and
when
he
got
to
his
feet
every
movement
had
the
suppleness
of
an
athlete
in
training
in
that
moment
i
realized
that
my
serious
business
had
now
begun
my
senses
suddenly
seemed
quicker
my
nerves
tenser
my
brain
more
active
the
big
game
had
started
and
he
and
i
were
playing
it
together
i
watched
him
with
strained
attention
it
was
a
funny
speech
stuffed
with
extravagance
and
vehemence
not
very
well
argued
and
terribly
discursive
his
main
point
was
that
germany
was
now
in
a
fine
democratic
mood
and
might
well
be
admitted
into
a
brotherly
partnership
that
indeed
she
had
never
been
in
any
other
mood
but
had
been
forced
into
violence
by
the
plots
of
her
enemies
much
of
it
i
should
have
thought
was
in
stark
defiance
of
the
defence
of
the
realm
acts
but
if
any
wise
scotland
yard
officer
had
listened
to
it
he
would
probably
have
considered
it
harmless
because
of
its
contradictions
it
was
full
of
a
fierce
earnestness
and
it
was
full
of
humour
american
metaphors
at
which
that
most
critical
audience
roared
with
laughter
but
it
was
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
they
were
accustomed
to
and
i
could
fancy
what
wake
would
have
said
of
it
the
conviction
grew
upon
me
that
blenkiron
was
deliberately
trying
to
prove
himself
an
honest
idiot
if
so
it
was
a
huge
success
he
produced
on
one
the
impression
of
the
type
of
sentimental
revolutionary
who
ruthlessly
knifes
his
opponent
and
then
weeps
and
prays
over
his
tomb
just
at
the
end
he
seemed
to
pull
himself
together
and
to
try
a
little
argument
he
made
a
great
point
of
the
austrian
socialists
going
to
stockholm
going
freely
and
with
their
government
assent
from
a
country
which
its
critics
called
an
autocracy
while
the
democratic
western
peoples
held
back
admit
i
have
any
real
proof
he
said
i
will
bet
my
bottom
dollar
that
the
influence
which
moved
the
austrian
government
to
allow
this
embassy
of
freedom
was
the
influence
of
germany
herself
and
that
is
the
land
from
which
the
allied
pharisees
draw
in
their
skirts
lest
their
garments
be
defiled
he
sat
down
amid
a
good
deal
of
applause
for
his
audience
had
not
been
bored
though
i
could
see
that
some
of
them
thought
his
praise
of
germany
a
bit
steep
it
was
all
right
in
biggleswick
to
prove
britain
in
the
wrong
but
it
was
a
slightly
different
thing
to
extol
the
enemy
i
was
puzzled
about
his
last
point
for
it
was
not
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
his
discourse
and
i
was
trying
to
guess
at
his
purpose
the
chairman
referred
to
it
in
his
concluding
remarks
am
in
a
position
he
said
bear
out
all
that
the
lecturer
has
said
i
can
go
further
i
can
assure
him
on
the
best
authority
that
his
surmise
is
correct
and
that
vienna
decision
to
send
delegates
to
stockholm
was
largely
dictated
by
representations
from
berlin
i
am
given
to
understand
that
the
fact
has
in
the
last
few
days
been
admitted
in
the
austrian
press
a
vote
of
thanks
was
carried
and
then
i
found
myself
shaking
hands
with
ivery
while
blenkiron
stood
a
yard
off
talking
to
one
of
the
misses
weekes
the
next
moment
i
was
being
introduced
brand
very
pleased
to
meet
you
said
the
voice
i
knew
so
well
ivery
has
been
telling
me
about
you
and
i
guess
we
got
something
to
say
to
each
other
we
both
from
noo
countries
and
we
got
to
teach
the
old
nations
a
little
mr
ivery
car
the
only
one
left
in
the
neighbourhood
carried
us
to
his
villa
and
presently
we
were
seated
in
a
it
was
not
a
pretty
house
but
it
had
the
luxury
of
an
expensive
hotel
and
the
supper
we
had
was
as
good
as
any
london
restaurant
gone
were
the
old
days
of
fish
and
toast
and
boiled
milk
blenkiron
squared
his
shoulders
and
showed
himself
a
noble
trencherman
year
ago
he
told
our
host
was
the
meanest
kind
of
dyspeptic
i
had
the
love
of
righteousness
in
my
heart
but
i
had
the
devil
in
my
stomach
then
i
heard
stories
about
the
robson
brothers
the
star
surgeons
way
out
west
in
white
springs
nebraska
they
were
reckoned
the
neatest
hands
in
the
world
at
carving
up
a
man
and
removing
devilments
from
his
intestines
now
sir
i
always
fought
pretty
shy
of
surgeons
for
i
considered
that
our
maker
never
intended
his
handiwork
to
be
reconstructed
like
a
bankrupt
dago
railway
but
by
that
time
i
was
feeling
so
almighty
wretched
that
i
could
have
paid
a
man
to
put
a
bullet
through
my
head
there
no
other
way
i
said
to
myself
either
you
forget
your
religion
and
your
miserable
cowardice
and
get
cut
up
or
it
you
for
the
golden
shore
so
i
set
my
teeth
and
journeyed
to
white
springs
and
the
brothers
had
a
look
at
my
duodenum
they
saw
that
the
darned
thing
would
do
so
they
sidetracked
it
and
made
a
noo
route
for
my
traffic
it
was
the
cunningest
piece
of
surgery
since
the
lord
took
a
rib
out
of
the
side
of
our
first
parent
they
got
a
mighty
fine
way
of
charging
too
for
they
take
five
per
cent
of
a
man
income
and
it
all
one
to
them
whether
a
meat
king
or
a
clerk
on
twenty
dollars
a
week
i
can
tell
you
i
took
some
trouble
to
be
a
very
rich
man
last
year
all
through
the
meal
i
sat
in
a
kind
of
stupor
i
was
trying
to
assimilate
the
new
blenkiron
and
drinking
in
the
comfort
of
his
heavenly
drawl
and
i
was
puzzling
my
head
about
ivery
i
had
a
ridiculous
notion
that
i
had
seen
him
before
but
delve
as
i
might
into
my
memory
i
could
place
him
he
was
the
incarnation
of
the
commonplace
a
comfortable
sentimentalist
who
patronized
pacificism
out
of
vanity
but
was
very
careful
not
to
dip
his
hands
too
far
he
was
always
damping
down
blenkiron
volcanic
utterances
course
as
you
know
the
other
side
have
an
argument
which
i
find
rather
hard
to
meet
can
sympathize
with
patriotism
and
even
with
jingoism
in
certain
moods
but
i
always
come
back
to
this
difficulty
opponents
are
not
so
much
as
these
were
the
sort
of
sentences
he
kept
throwing
in
and
he
was
full
of
quotations
from
private
conversations
he
had
had
with
every
sort
of
person
including
members
of
the
government
i
remember
that
he
expressed
great
admiration
for
mr
balfour
of
all
that
talk
i
only
recalled
one
thing
clearly
and
i
recalled
it
because
blenkiron
seemed
to
collect
his
wits
and
try
to
argue
just
as
he
had
done
at
the
end
of
his
lecture
he
was
speaking
about
a
story
he
had
heard
from
someone
who
had
heard
it
from
someone
else
that
austria
in
the
last
week
of
july
had
accepted
russia
proposal
to
hold
her
hand
and
negotiate
and
that
the
kaiser
had
sent
a
message
to
the
tsar
saying
he
agreed
according
to
his
story
this
telegram
had
been
received
in
petrograd
and
had
been
like
ems
telegram
before
it
reached
the
emperor
he
expressed
his
disbelief
in
the
yarn
reckon
if
it
had
been
true
he
said
have
had
the
right
text
out
long
ago
they
have
kept
a
copy
in
berlin
all
the
same
i
did
hear
a
sort
of
rumour
that
some
kind
of
message
of
that
sort
was
published
in
a
german
paper
mr
ivery
looked
wise
are
right
he
said
happen
to
know
that
it
has
been
published
you
will
find
it
in
the
do
say
he
said
admiringly
wish
i
could
read
the
old
tombstone
language
but
if
i
could
they
would
let
me
have
the
papers
yes
they
would
mr
ivery
laughed
pleasantly
has
still
a
good
share
of
freedom
any
respectable
person
can
get
a
permit
to
import
the
enemy
press
i
not
considered
quite
respectable
for
the
authorities
have
a
narrow
definition
of
patriotism
but
happily
i
have
respectable
friends
blenkiron
was
staying
the
night
and
i
took
my
leave
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
they
both
came
into
the
hall
to
see
me
off
and
as
i
was
helping
myself
to
a
drink
and
my
host
was
looking
for
my
hat
and
stick
i
suddenly
heard
blenkiron
whisper
in
my
ear
the
day
after
tomorrow
he
said
then
he
took
a
formal
farewell
brand
it
been
an
honour
for
me
as
an
american
citizen
to
make
your
acquaintance
sir
i
will
consider
myself
fortunate
if
we
have
an
early
reunion
i
am
stopping
at
claridge
and
i
hope
to
be
privileged
to
receive
you
there
chapter
three
the
reflections
of
a
cured
dyspeptic
hours
later
i
found
myself
in
my
rooms
in
westminster
i
thought
there
might
be
a
message
for
me
there
for
i
did
propose
to
go
and
call
openly
on
blenkiron
at
claridge
till
i
had
his
instructions
but
there
was
no
message
only
a
line
from
peter
saying
he
had
hopes
of
being
sent
to
switzerland
that
made
me
realize
that
he
must
be
pretty
badly
broken
up
presently
the
telephone
bell
rang
it
was
blenkiron
who
spoke
down
and
have
a
talk
with
your
brokers
about
the
war
loan
arrive
there
about
twelve
and
do
go
upstairs
till
you
have
met
a
friend
you
better
have
a
quick
luncheon
at
your
club
and
then
come
to
traill
bookshop
in
the
haymarket
at
two
you
can
get
back
to
biggleswick
by
the
i
did
as
i
was
bid
and
twenty
minutes
later
having
travelled
by
underground
for
i
could
raise
a
taxi
i
approached
the
block
of
chambers
in
leadenhall
street
where
dwelt
the
respected
firm
who
managed
my
investments
it
was
still
a
few
minutes
before
noon
and
as
i
slowed
down
a
familiar
figure
came
out
of
the
bank
next
door
ivery
beamed
recognition
for
the
day
mr
brand
he
asked
have
to
see
my
brokers
i
said
the
south
african
papers
in
my
club
and
get
back
by
the
any
chance
of
your
company
yes
that
my
train
we
meet
at
the
station
he
bustled
off
looking
very
smart
with
his
neat
clothes
and
a
rose
in
his
i
lunched
impatiently
and
at
two
was
turning
over
some
new
books
in
traill
shop
with
an
eye
on
the
behind
me
it
seemed
a
public
place
for
an
assignation
i
had
begun
to
dip
into
a
big
illustrated
book
on
when
an
assistant
came
up
manager
compliments
sir
and
he
thinks
there
are
some
old
works
of
travel
upstairs
that
might
interest
you
i
followed
him
obediently
to
an
upper
floor
lined
with
every
kind
of
volume
and
with
tables
littered
with
maps
and
engravings
way
sir
he
said
and
opened
a
door
in
the
wall
concealed
by
bogus
i
found
myself
in
a
little
study
and
blenkiron
sitting
in
an
armchair
smoking
he
got
up
and
seized
both
my
hands
dick
this
is
better
than
good
noos
i
heard
all
about
your
exploits
since
we
parted
a
year
ago
on
the
wharf
at
liverpool
we
both
been
busy
on
our
own
jobs
and
there
was
no
way
of
keeping
you
wise
about
my
doings
for
after
i
thought
i
was
cured
i
got
worse
than
hell
inside
and
as
i
told
you
had
to
get
the
to
dig
into
me
after
that
i
was
playing
a
pretty
dark
game
and
had
to
get
down
and
out
of
decent
society
but
holy
mike
i
a
new
man
i
used
to
do
my
work
with
a
sick
heart
and
a
taste
in
my
mouth
like
a
graveyard
and
now
i
can
eat
and
drink
what
i
like
and
frolic
round
like
a
colt
i
wake
up
every
morning
whistling
and
thank
the
good
god
that
i
alive
it
was
a
bad
day
for
kaiser
when
i
got
on
the
cars
for
white
springs
is
a
rum
place
to
meet
i
said
you
brought
me
by
a
roundabout
road
he
grinned
and
offered
me
a
cigar
were
reasons
it
do
do
for
you
and
me
to
advertise
our
acquaintance
in
the
street
as
for
the
shop
i
owned
it
for
five
years
i
a
taste
for
good
reading
though
you
would
think
it
and
it
tickles
me
to
hand
it
out
across
the
counter
first
i
want
to
hear
about
biggleswick
is
a
great
deal
to
it
a
lot
of
ignorance
a
large
slice
of
vanity
and
a
pinch
or
two
of
honesty
these
are
the
ingredients
of
the
pie
not
much
real
harm
in
it
there
one
or
two
dirty
literary
gents
who
should
be
in
a
navvies
battalion
but
about
as
dangerous
as
yellow
kaffir
dogs
i
learned
a
lot
and
got
all
the
arguments
by
heart
but
you
might
plant
a
biggleswick
in
every
shire
and
it
would
help
the
boche
i
can
see
where
the
danger
lies
all
the
same
these
fellows
talked
academic
anarchism
but
the
genuine
article
is
somewhere
about
and
to
find
it
you
got
to
look
in
the
big
industrial
districts
we
had
faint
echoes
of
it
in
biggleswick
i
mean
that
the
really
dangerous
fellows
are
those
who
want
to
close
up
the
war
at
once
and
so
get
on
with
their
blessed
class
war
which
cuts
across
nationalities
as
for
being
spies
and
that
sort
of
thing
the
biggleswick
lads
are
too
callow
said
blenkiron
reflectively
have
got
as
much
sense
as
god
gave
to
geese
you
sure
you
did
hit
against
any
heavier
metal
there
a
man
called
launcelot
wake
who
came
down
to
speak
once
i
had
met
him
before
he
has
the
makings
of
a
fanatic
and
he
the
more
dangerous
because
you
can
see
his
conscience
is
uneasy
i
can
fancy
him
bombing
a
prime
minister
merely
to
quiet
his
own
doubts
he
said
else
i
reflected
mr
ivery
but
you
know
him
better
than
i
should
put
much
on
him
but
i
not
precisely
certain
for
i
never
had
a
chance
of
getting
to
know
him
said
blenkiron
in
surprise
has
a
hobby
for
youth
just
as
another
rich
man
might
fancy
orchids
or
fast
trotters
you
sure
can
place
him
right
enough
dare
say
only
i
do
know
enough
to
be
positive
he
sucked
at
his
cigar
for
a
minute
or
so
guess
dick
if
i
told
you
all
i
been
doing
since
i
reached
these
shores
you
would
call
me
a
romancer
i
been
way
down
among
the
toilers
i
did
a
spell
as
unskilled
dilooted
labour
in
the
barrow
shipyards
i
was
barman
in
a
hotel
on
the
portsmouth
road
and
i
put
in
a
black
month
driving
a
taxicab
in
the
city
of
london
for
a
while
i
was
the
accredited
correspondent
of
the
noo
york
sentinel
and
used
to
go
with
the
rest
of
the
bunch
to
the
of
of
state
and
war
office
generals
they
censored
my
stuff
so
cruel
that
the
paper
fired
me
then
i
went
on
a
round
england
and
sat
for
a
fortnight
in
a
little
farm
in
suffolk
by
and
by
i
came
back
to
claridge
and
this
bookshop
for
i
had
learned
most
of
what
i
wanted
had
learned
he
went
on
turning
his
curious
full
ruminating
eyes
on
me
the
british
is
about
the
soundest
piece
of
humanity
on
god
earth
he
grumbles
a
bit
and
jibs
a
bit
when
he
thinks
the
government
are
giving
him
a
crooked
deal
but
he
gotten
the
patience
of
job
and
the
sand
of
a
gamecock
and
he
gotten
humour
too
that
tickles
me
to
death
there
not
much
trouble
in
that
quarter
for
it
he
and
his
kind
that
beating
the
hun
but
i
picked
up
a
thing
or
two
besides
that
he
leaned
forward
and
tapped
me
on
the
knee
reverence
the
british
intelligence
service
flies
do
settle
on
it
to
any
considerable
extent
it
got
a
mighty
fine
mesh
but
there
one
hole
in
that
mesh
and
it
our
job
to
mend
it
there
a
brain
in
the
game
against
us
i
struck
it
a
couple
of
years
ago
when
i
was
hunting
dumba
and
albert
and
i
thought
it
was
in
noo
york
but
it
was
i
struck
its
working
again
at
home
last
year
and
located
its
head
office
in
europe
so
i
tried
switzerland
and
holland
but
only
bits
of
it
were
there
the
centre
of
the
web
where
the
old
spider
sits
is
right
here
in
england
and
for
six
months
i
been
shadowing
that
spider
there
a
gang
to
help
a
big
gang
and
a
clever
gang
and
partly
an
innocent
gang
but
there
only
one
brain
and
it
to
match
that
that
the
robson
brothers
settled
my
duodenum
i
was
listening
with
a
quickened
pulse
for
now
at
last
i
was
getting
to
business
is
he
international
socialist
or
anarchist
or
what
i
asked
boche
agent
but
the
brand
in
the
catalogue
bigger
than
steinmeier
or
old
bismarck
staubier
thank
god
i
got
him
located
i
must
put
you
wise
about
some
things
he
lay
back
in
his
rubbed
leather
armchair
and
yarned
for
twenty
minutes
he
told
me
how
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
scotland
yard
had
had
a
pretty
complete
register
of
enemy
spies
and
without
making
any
fuss
had
just
tidied
them
away
after
that
the
covey
having
been
broken
up
it
was
a
question
of
picking
off
stray
birds
that
had
taken
some
doing
there
had
been
all
kinds
of
inflammatory
stuff
around
red
masons
and
international
anarchists
and
worst
of
all
international
but
they
had
mostly
been
ordinary
cranks
and
rogues
the
tools
of
the
boche
agents
rather
than
agents
themselves
however
by
the
middle
of
most
of
the
stragglers
had
been
gathered
in
but
there
remained
loose
ends
and
towards
the
close
of
last
year
somebody
was
very
busy
combining
these
ends
into
a
net
funny
cases
cropped
up
of
the
leakage
of
vital
information
they
began
to
be
bad
about
october
when
the
hun
submarines
started
on
a
special
racket
the
enemy
suddenly
appeared
possessed
of
a
knowledge
which
we
thought
to
be
shared
only
by
half
a
dozen
officers
blenkiron
said
he
was
not
surprised
at
the
leakage
for
there
always
a
lot
of
people
who
hear
things
they
ought
to
what
surprised
him
was
that
it
got
so
quickly
to
the
enemy
then
after
last
february
when
the
hun
submarines
went
in
for
frightfulness
on
a
big
scale
the
thing
grew
desperate
leakages
occurred
every
week
and
the
business
was
managed
by
people
who
knew
their
way
about
for
they
avoided
all
the
traps
set
for
them
and
when
bogus
news
was
released
on
purpose
they
never
sent
it
a
convoy
which
had
been
kept
a
deadly
secret
would
be
attacked
at
the
one
place
where
it
was
helpless
a
carefully
prepared
defensive
plan
would
be
checkmated
before
it
could
be
tried
blenkiron
said
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
a
single
brain
was
behind
it
all
for
there
was
no
similarity
in
the
cases
but
he
had
a
strong
impression
all
the
time
that
it
was
the
work
of
one
man
we
managed
to
close
some
of
the
but
we
could
put
our
hands
near
the
big
ones
this
time
said
he
reckoned
i
was
about
ready
to
change
my
methods
i
had
been
working
by
what
the
highbrows
call
induction
trying
to
argue
up
from
the
deeds
to
the
doer
now
i
tried
a
new
lay
which
was
to
calculate
down
from
the
doer
to
the
deeds
they
call
it
deduction
i
opined
that
somewhere
in
this
island
was
a
gentleman
whom
we
will
call
mr
x
and
that
pursuing
the
line
of
business
he
did
he
must
have
certain
characteristics
i
considered
very
carefully
just
what
sort
of
personage
he
must
be
i
had
noticed
that
his
device
was
apparently
the
double
bluff
that
is
to
say
when
he
had
two
courses
open
to
him
a
and
b
he
pretended
he
was
going
to
take
b
and
so
got
us
guessing
that
he
would
try
a
then
he
took
b
after
all
so
i
reckoned
that
his
camouflage
must
correspond
to
this
little
idiosyncrasy
being
a
boche
agent
he
would
pretend
to
be
a
hearty
patriot
an
honest
old
tory
that
would
be
only
the
single
bluff
i
considered
that
he
would
be
a
pacifist
cunning
enough
just
to
keep
inside
the
law
but
with
the
eyes
of
the
police
on
him
he
would
write
books
which
would
not
be
allowed
to
be
exported
he
would
get
himself
disliked
in
the
popular
papers
but
all
the
mugwumps
would
admire
his
moral
courage
i
drew
a
mighty
fine
picture
to
myself
of
just
the
man
i
expected
to
find
then
i
started
out
to
look
for
him
blenkiron
face
took
on
the
air
of
a
disappointed
child
was
no
good
i
kept
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
and
wore
myself
out
playing
the
sleuth
on
innocents
you
found
him
all
right
i
cried
a
sudden
suspicion
leaping
into
my
brain
found
he
said
sadly
the
credit
does
not
belong
to
john
blenkiron
that
child
merely
muddied
the
pond
the
big
fish
was
left
for
a
young
lady
to
hook
know
i
cried
excitedly
name
is
miss
mary
lamington
he
shook
a
disapproving
head
guessed
right
my
son
but
forgotten
your
manners
this
is
a
rough
business
and
we
wo
bring
in
the
name
of
a
gently
reared
and
young
girl
if
we
speak
to
her
at
all
we
call
her
by
a
pet
name
out
of
the
anyhow
she
hooked
the
fish
though
he
is
landed
see
any
light
i
gasped
ivery
nothing
much
to
look
at
you
say
a
common
that
you
would
keep
out
of
a
sunday
school
a
touch
of
the
drummer
too
to
show
he
has
no
dealings
with
your
effete
aristocracy
a
languishing
that
adores
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
as
mild
you
say
as
curds
and
cream
blenkiron
got
out
of
his
chair
and
stood
above
me
tell
you
dick
that
man
makes
my
spine
cold
he
has
a
drop
of
good
red
blood
in
him
the
dirtiest
apache
is
a
christian
gentleman
compared
to
moxon
ivery
he
as
cruel
as
a
snake
and
as
deep
as
hell
but
by
god
got
a
brain
below
his
hat
he
hooked
and
we
playing
him
but
lord
knows
if
he
ever
be
landed
on
earth
do
you
put
him
away
i
asked
have
the
proof
legal
proof
i
mean
though
there
buckets
of
the
other
kind
i
could
put
up
a
morally
certain
case
but
he
beat
me
in
a
court
of
law
and
half
a
hundred
sheep
would
get
up
in
parliament
and
bleat
about
persecution
he
has
a
graft
with
every
collection
of
cranks
in
england
and
with
all
the
geese
that
cackle
about
the
liberty
of
the
individual
when
the
boche
is
ranging
about
to
enslave
the
world
no
sir
that
too
dangerous
a
game
besides
i
a
better
in
hand
moxon
ivery
is
the
member
of
this
state
his
is
the
completest
thing
outside
the
recording
angel
little
we
taken
up
his
references
in
every
corner
of
the
globe
and
all
as
right
as
morgan
balance
sheet
from
these
it
appears
he
been
a
citizen
ever
since
he
was
in
he
was
raised
in
norfolk
and
there
are
people
living
who
remember
his
father
he
was
educated
at
melton
school
and
his
name
in
the
register
he
was
in
business
in
valparaiso
and
there
enough
evidence
to
write
three
volumes
of
his
innocent
life
there
then
he
came
home
with
a
modest
competence
two
years
before
the
war
and
has
been
in
the
public
eye
ever
since
he
was
liberal
candidate
for
a
london
constitooency
and
he
has
decorated
the
board
of
every
institootion
formed
for
the
amelioration
of
mankind
he
got
enough
alibis
to
choke
a
boa
constrictor
and
they
and
and
mostly
damned
lies
but
you
ca
beat
him
at
that
stunt
the
the
superbest
actor
that
ever
walked
the
earth
you
can
see
it
in
his
face
it
is
a
face
it
a
mask
he
could
make
himself
look
like
shakespeare
or
julius
caesar
or
billy
sunday
or
richard
hannay
if
he
wanted
to
he
has
got
any
personality
either
he
got
fifty
and
there
no
one
he
could
call
his
own
i
reckon
when
the
devil
gets
the
handling
of
him
at
last
he
have
to
put
sand
on
his
claws
to
keep
him
from
slipping
through
blenkiron
was
settled
in
his
chair
again
with
one
leg
hoisted
over
the
side
closed
a
fair
number
of
his
channels
in
the
last
few
months
no
he
do
suspect
me
the
world
knows
nothing
of
its
greatest
men
and
to
him
i
only
a
yankee
who
gives
big
subscriptions
to
loony
societies
and
will
travel
a
hundred
miles
to
let
off
steam
before
any
kind
of
audience
he
been
to
see
me
at
claridge
and
arranged
that
he
shall
know
all
my
record
a
darned
bad
record
it
is
too
for
two
years
ago
i
was
violent
before
i
found
salvation
and
was
requested
to
leave
england
when
i
was
home
last
i
was
officially
when
i
was
stretched
upon
a
bed
of
pain
mr
moxon
ivery
do
take
any
stock
in
john
blenkiron
as
a
serious
proposition
and
while
i
been
here
i
been
so
low
down
in
the
social
scale
and
working
in
so
many
devious
ways
that
he
ca
connect
me
up
as
i
was
saying
we
cut
most
of
his
wires
but
the
biggest
we
have
got
at
he
still
sending
stuff
out
and
mighty
compromising
stuff
it
is
now
listen
close
dick
for
we
coming
near
your
own
business
it
appeared
that
blenkiron
had
reason
to
suspect
that
the
channel
still
open
had
something
to
do
with
the
north
he
could
get
closer
than
that
till
he
heard
from
his
people
that
a
certain
abel
gresson
had
turned
up
in
glasgow
from
the
states
this
gresson
he
discovered
was
the
same
as
one
wrankester
who
as
a
leader
of
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
had
been
mixed
up
in
some
ugly
cases
of
sabotage
in
colorado
he
kept
his
news
to
himself
for
he
did
want
the
police
to
interfere
but
he
had
his
own
lot
get
into
touch
with
gresson
and
shadow
him
closely
the
man
was
very
discreet
but
very
mysterious
and
he
would
disappear
for
a
week
at
a
time
leaving
no
trace
for
some
unknown
reason
he
could
explain
why
blenkiron
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
gresson
was
in
touch
with
ivery
so
he
made
experiments
to
prove
it
wanted
various
to
make
certain
and
i
got
them
the
night
before
last
my
visit
to
biggleswick
was
good
business
do
know
what
they
meant
i
said
i
know
where
they
came
in
one
was
in
your
speech
when
you
spoke
of
the
austrian
socialists
and
ivery
took
you
up
about
them
the
other
was
after
supper
when
he
quoted
the
no
fool
dick
he
said
with
his
slow
smile
hit
the
mark
first
shot
you
know
me
and
you
could
follow
my
process
of
thought
in
those
remarks
ivery
not
knowing
me
so
well
and
having
his
head
full
of
just
that
sort
of
argument
saw
nothing
unusual
those
bits
of
noos
were
pumped
into
gresson
that
he
might
pass
them
on
and
he
did
pass
them
on
to
ivery
they
completed
my
chain
they
were
commonplace
enough
things
which
he
might
have
guessed
for
himself
they
were
they
were
the
nicest
of
political
noos
which
all
the
cranks
have
been
reaching
after
they
were
quotations
from
german
papers
he
might
have
had
the
papers
themselves
earlier
than
you
thought
again
the
paragraph
never
appeared
in
the
but
we
faked
up
a
torn
bit
of
that
noospaper
and
a
very
pretty
bit
of
forgery
it
was
and
gresson
who
a
kind
of
a
scholar
was
allowed
to
have
it
he
passed
it
on
ivery
showed
it
me
two
nights
ago
nothing
like
it
ever
sullied
the
columns
of
boche
journalism
no
it
was
a
perfectly
final
proof
now
dick
it
up
to
you
to
get
after
gresson
i
said
jolly
glad
i
to
start
work
again
i
getting
fat
from
lack
of
exercise
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
catch
gresson
out
in
some
piece
of
blackguardism
and
have
him
and
ivery
snugly
put
away
do
want
anything
of
the
kind
he
said
very
slowly
and
distinctly
got
to
attend
very
close
to
your
instructions
i
cherish
these
two
beauties
as
if
they
were
my
own
boys
i
would
for
the
world
interfere
with
their
comfort
and
liberty
i
want
them
to
go
on
corresponding
with
their
friends
i
want
to
give
them
every
facility
he
burst
out
laughing
at
my
mystified
face
here
dick
how
do
we
want
to
treat
the
boche
why
to
fill
him
up
with
all
the
cunningest
lies
and
get
him
to
act
on
them
now
here
is
moxon
ivery
who
has
always
given
them
good
information
they
trust
him
absolutely
and
we
would
be
fools
to
spoil
their
confidence
only
if
we
can
find
out
moxon
methods
we
can
arrange
to
use
them
ourselves
and
send
noos
in
his
name
which
is
quite
so
genooine
every
word
he
dispatches
goes
straight
to
the
grand
high
secret
general
staff
and
old
hindenburg
and
ludendorff
put
towels
round
their
heads
and
cipher
it
out
we
want
to
encourage
them
to
go
on
doing
it
we
arrange
to
send
true
stuff
that
do
matter
so
as
they
continue
to
trust
him
and
a
few
selected
falsehoods
that
matter
like
hell
it
a
game
you
ca
play
for
ever
but
with
luck
i
propose
to
play
it
long
enough
to
confuse
fritz
little
plans
his
face
became
serious
and
wore
the
air
that
our
corps
commander
used
to
have
at
the
big
before
a
push
not
going
to
give
you
instructions
for
you
man
enough
to
make
your
own
but
i
can
give
you
the
general
hang
of
the
situation
you
tell
ivery
you
going
north
to
inquire
into
industrial
disputes
at
first
hand
that
will
seem
to
him
natural
and
in
line
with
your
recent
behaviour
he
tell
his
people
that
you
a
guileless
colonial
who
feels
disgruntled
with
britain
and
may
come
in
useful
you
go
to
a
man
of
mine
in
glasgow
a
agitator
who
chooses
that
way
of
doing
his
bit
for
his
country
it
a
darned
hard
way
and
darned
dangerous
through
him
you
get
in
touch
with
gresson
and
keep
alongside
that
bright
citizen
find
out
what
he
is
doing
and
get
a
chance
of
following
him
he
must
never
suspect
you
and
for
that
purpose
you
must
be
very
near
the
edge
of
the
law
yourself
you
go
up
there
as
an
unabashed
pacifist
and
you
live
with
folk
that
will
turn
your
stomach
maybe
you
have
to
break
some
of
these
rules
the
british
government
have
invented
to
defend
the
realm
and
it
up
to
you
not
to
get
caught
out
remember
you
get
no
help
from
me
you
got
to
wise
up
about
gresson
with
the
whole
forces
of
the
british
state
arrayed
officially
against
you
i
guess
it
a
steep
proposition
but
you
man
enough
to
make
good
as
we
shook
hands
he
added
a
last
word
must
take
your
own
time
but
it
not
a
case
for
slouching
every
day
that
passes
ivery
is
sending
out
the
worst
kind
of
poison
the
boche
is
blowing
up
for
a
big
campaign
in
the
field
and
a
big
effort
to
shake
the
nerve
and
confuse
the
judgement
of
our
civilians
the
whole
earth
and
about
reached
the
there
pretty
big
stakes
hang
on
you
dick
for
things
are
getting
mighty
delicate
i
purchased
a
new
novel
in
the
shop
and
reached
st
pancras
in
time
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
at
the
buffet
ivery
was
at
the
bookstall
buying
an
evening
paper
when
we
got
into
the
carriage
he
seized
my
and
kept
laughing
and
calling
my
attention
to
the
pictures
as
i
looked
at
him
i
thought
that
he
made
a
perfect
picture
of
the
citizen
turned
countryman
going
back
of
an
evening
to
his
innocent
home
everything
was
right
his
neat
tweeds
his
light
spats
his
spotted
neckcloth
and
his
aquascutum
not
that
i
dared
look
at
him
much
what
i
had
learned
made
me
eager
to
search
his
face
but
i
did
not
dare
show
any
increased
interest
i
had
always
been
a
little
with
him
for
i
had
never
much
liked
him
so
i
had
to
keep
on
the
same
manner
he
was
as
merry
as
a
grig
full
of
chat
and
very
friendly
and
amusing
i
remember
he
picked
up
the
book
i
had
brought
off
that
morning
to
read
in
the
train
the
second
volume
of
hazlitt
the
last
of
my
english
classics
and
discoursed
so
wisely
about
books
that
i
wished
i
had
spent
more
time
in
his
company
at
biggleswick
was
the
academic
radical
of
his
day
he
said
is
always
lashing
himself
into
a
state
of
theoretical
fury
over
abuses
he
has
never
encountered
in
person
men
who
are
up
against
the
real
thing
save
their
breath
for
action
that
gave
me
my
cue
to
tell
him
about
my
journey
to
the
north
i
said
i
had
learned
a
lot
in
biggleswick
but
i
wanted
to
see
industrial
life
at
close
quarters
i
might
become
like
hazlitt
i
said
he
was
very
interested
and
encouraging
the
right
way
to
set
about
it
he
said
were
you
thinking
of
going
i
told
him
that
i
had
half
thought
of
barrow
but
decided
to
try
glasgow
since
the
clyde
seemed
to
be
a
warm
corner
he
said
only
wish
i
was
coming
with
you
it
take
you
a
little
while
to
understand
the
language
you
find
a
good
deal
of
senseless
bellicosity
among
the
workmen
for
they
got
about
the
war
as
they
used
to
have
about
their
labour
politics
but
there
plenty
of
shrewd
brains
and
sound
hearts
too
you
must
write
and
tell
me
your
conclusions
it
was
a
warm
evening
and
he
dozed
the
last
part
of
the
journey
i
looked
at
him
and
wished
i
could
see
into
the
mind
at
the
back
of
that
face
i
counted
for
nothing
in
his
eyes
not
even
enough
for
him
to
want
to
make
me
a
tool
and
i
was
setting
out
to
try
to
make
a
tool
of
him
it
sounded
a
forlorn
enterprise
and
all
the
while
i
was
puzzled
with
a
persistent
sense
of
recognition
i
told
myself
it
was
idiocy
for
a
man
with
a
face
like
that
must
have
hints
of
resemblance
to
a
thousand
people
but
the
idea
kept
nagging
at
me
till
we
reached
our
destination
as
we
emerged
from
the
station
into
the
golden
evening
i
saw
mary
lamington
again
she
was
with
one
of
the
weekes
girls
and
after
the
biggleswick
fashion
was
bareheaded
so
that
the
sun
glinted
from
her
hair
ivery
swept
his
hat
off
and
made
her
a
pretty
speech
while
i
faced
her
steady
eyes
with
the
expressionlessness
of
the
stage
conspirator
charming
child
he
observed
as
we
passed
on
without
a
touch
of
seriousness
too
which
may
yet
be
touched
to
noble
issues
i
considered
as
i
made
my
way
to
my
final
supper
with
the
jimsons
that
the
said
child
was
likely
to
prove
a
sufficiently
serious
business
for
mr
moxon
ivery
before
the
game
was
out
chapter
four
andrew
amos
i
took
the
train
three
days
later
from
king
cross
to
edinburgh
i
went
to
the
pentland
hotel
in
princes
street
and
left
there
a
containing
some
clean
linen
and
a
change
of
clothes
i
had
been
thinking
the
thing
out
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
must
have
a
base
somewhere
and
a
fresh
outfit
then
in
tweeds
and
with
no
more
luggage
than
a
small
trench
i
descended
upon
the
city
of
glasgow
i
walked
from
the
station
to
the
address
which
blenkiron
had
given
me
it
was
a
hot
summer
evening
and
the
streets
were
filled
with
bareheaded
women
and
artisans
as
i
made
my
way
down
the
dumbarton
road
i
was
amazed
at
the
number
of
fellows
about
considering
that
you
could
stir
a
mile
on
any
british
front
without
bumping
up
against
a
glasgow
battalion
then
i
realized
that
there
were
such
things
as
munitions
and
ships
and
i
wondered
no
more
a
stout
and
dishevelled
lady
at
a
directed
me
to
mr
dwelling
stairs
up
andra
will
be
in
noo
havin
his
tea
he
no
yin
for
overtime
he
generally
hame
on
the
chap
of
six
i
ascended
the
stairs
with
a
sinking
heart
for
like
all
south
africans
i
have
a
horror
of
dirt
the
place
was
pretty
filthy
but
at
each
landing
there
were
two
doors
with
handles
and
brass
plates
on
one
i
read
the
name
of
andrew
amos
a
man
in
his
opened
to
me
a
little
man
without
a
collar
and
with
an
unbuttoned
waistcoat
that
was
all
i
saw
of
him
in
the
dim
light
but
he
held
out
a
paw
like
a
gorilla
and
drew
me
in
the
which
looked
over
many
chimneys
to
a
pale
yellow
sky
against
which
two
factory
stalks
stood
out
sharply
gave
me
light
enough
to
observe
him
fully
he
was
about
five
feet
four
and
with
a
great
towsy
head
of
grizzled
hair
he
wore
spectacles
and
his
face
was
like
some
scots
minister
for
he
had
heavy
eyebrows
and
whiskers
which
joined
each
other
under
his
jaw
while
his
chin
and
enormous
upper
lip
were
his
eyes
were
steely
grey
and
very
solemn
but
full
of
smouldering
energy
his
voice
was
enormous
and
would
have
shaken
the
walls
if
he
had
not
had
the
habit
of
speaking
with
lips
he
had
not
a
sound
tooth
in
his
head
a
saucer
full
of
tea
and
a
plate
which
had
once
contained
ham
and
eggs
were
on
the
table
he
nodded
towards
them
and
asked
me
if
i
had
fed
no
eat
onything
well
some
would
offer
ye
a
dram
but
this
house
is
staunch
teetotal
i
door
ye
have
to
try
the
nearest
public
if
ye
thirsty
i
disclaimed
any
bodily
wants
and
produced
my
pipe
at
which
he
started
to
fill
an
old
clay
brand
your
name
he
asked
in
his
gusty
voice
was
expectin
ye
but
dod
man
ye
late
he
extricated
from
his
trousers
pocket
an
ancient
silver
watch
and
regarded
it
with
disfavour
dashed
thing
has
stoppit
what
do
ye
make
the
time
mr
brand
he
proceeded
to
prise
open
the
lid
of
his
watch
with
the
knife
he
had
used
to
cut
his
tobacco
and
as
he
examined
the
works
he
turned
the
back
of
the
case
towards
me
on
the
inside
i
saw
pasted
mary
lamington
wafer
i
held
my
watch
so
that
he
could
see
the
same
token
his
keen
eyes
raised
for
a
second
noted
it
and
he
shut
his
own
with
a
snap
and
returned
it
to
his
pocket
his
manner
lost
its
wariness
and
became
almost
genial
come
up
to
see
glasgow
mr
brand
well
it
a
steerin
bit
and
there
honest
folk
bides
in
it
and
some
not
so
honest
they
tell
me
ye
from
south
africa
that
a
long
gait
away
but
i
ken
something
aboot
south
africa
for
i
had
a
cousin
son
oot
there
for
his
lungs
he
was
in
a
shop
in
main
street
bloomfountain
they
called
him
peter
dobson
ye
would
maybe
mind
of
him
then
he
discoursed
of
the
clyde
he
was
an
incomer
he
told
me
from
the
borders
his
native
place
being
the
town
of
galashiels
or
as
he
called
it
began
as
a
powerloom
tuner
in
stavert
mill
then
my
father
dee
and
i
took
up
his
trade
of
jiner
but
it
no
world
nowadays
for
the
sma
independent
business
so
i
cam
to
the
clyde
and
learned
a
shipwright
job
i
may
say
i
become
a
leader
in
the
trade
for
though
i
no
an
official
of
the
union
and
not
likely
to
be
there
no
man
word
carries
more
weight
than
mine
and
the
goavernment
kens
that
for
they
sent
me
on
commissions
up
and
down
the
land
to
look
at
wuds
and
report
on
the
nature
of
the
timber
bribery
they
think
it
is
but
andrew
amos
is
not
to
be
bribit
have
his
say
about
any
goavernment
on
earth
and
tell
them
to
their
face
what
he
thinks
of
them
ay
and
he
fight
the
case
of
the
workingman
against
his
oppressor
should
it
be
the
goavernment
or
the
fatted
calves
they
ca
labour
members
ye
have
heard
tell
o
the
shop
stewards
mr
brand
i
admitted
i
had
for
i
had
been
well
coached
by
blenkiron
in
the
current
history
of
industrial
disputes
i
a
shop
steward
we
represent
the
rank
and
file
against
that
have
lost
the
confidence
o
the
workingman
but
no
socialist
and
i
would
have
ye
keep
mind
of
that
i
yin
o
the
old
border
radicals
and
i
not
like
to
change
i
for
individual
liberty
and
equal
rights
and
chances
for
all
men
i
no
more
bow
down
before
a
dagon
of
a
goavernment
official
than
before
the
baal
of
a
feckless
tweedside
laird
i
to
keep
my
views
to
mysel
for
thae
young
lads
are
all
with
their
wee
books
about
cawpital
and
collectivism
and
a
wheen
long
senseless
words
i
wouldna
fyle
my
tongue
with
them
and
their
socialism
there
more
gumption
in
a
page
of
john
stuart
mill
than
in
all
that
foreign
trash
but
as
i
say
i
got
to
keep
a
quiet
sough
for
the
world
is
gettin
socialism
now
like
the
measles
it
all
comes
of
a
defective
eddication
what
does
a
border
radical
say
about
the
war
i
asked
he
took
off
his
spectacles
and
cocked
his
shaggy
brows
at
me
tell
ye
mr
brand
all
that
was
bad
in
all
that
i
ever
wrestled
with
since
i
cam
to
years
o
discretion
tories
and
lairds
and
manufacturers
and
publicans
and
the
auld
kirk
all
that
was
bad
i
say
for
there
were
orra
bits
of
decency
ye
find
in
the
germans
full
measure
pressed
down
and
running
over
when
the
war
started
i
considered
the
subject
calmly
for
three
days
and
then
i
said
andra
amos
found
the
enemy
at
last
the
ones
ye
fought
before
were
in
a
manner
speakin
just
misguided
friends
it
either
you
or
the
kaiser
this
time
my
man
his
eyes
had
lost
their
gravity
and
had
taken
on
a
sombre
ferocity
and
i
not
wavered
i
got
a
word
early
in
the
business
as
to
the
way
i
could
serve
my
country
best
it
not
been
an
easy
job
and
there
plenty
of
honest
folk
the
day
will
give
me
a
bad
name
they
think
i
stirrin
up
the
men
at
home
and
desertin
the
cause
o
the
lads
at
the
front
man
i
keepin
them
straight
if
i
didna
fight
their
battles
on
a
sound
economic
isshue
they
would
take
the
dorts
and
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
blagyird
that
preached
revolution
me
and
my
like
are
if
ye
follow
me
and
dinna
you
make
ony
mistake
mr
brand
the
men
that
are
agitating
for
a
rise
in
wages
are
not
for
peace
they
fighting
for
the
lads
overseas
as
much
as
for
themselves
there
not
yin
in
a
thousand
that
wouldna
sweat
himself
blind
to
beat
the
germans
the
goavernment
has
made
mistakes
and
maun
be
made
to
pay
for
them
if
it
were
not
so
the
men
would
feel
like
a
moose
in
a
trap
for
they
would
have
no
way
to
make
their
grievance
felt
what
for
should
the
big
man
double
his
profits
and
the
small
man
be
ill
set
to
get
his
ham
and
egg
on
sabbath
mornin
that
the
meaning
o
labour
unrest
as
they
call
it
and
it
a
good
thing
says
i
for
if
labour
didna
get
its
leg
over
the
traces
now
and
then
the
spunk
o
the
land
would
be
dead
in
it
and
hindenburg
could
squeeze
it
like
a
rotten
aipple
i
asked
if
he
spoke
for
the
bulk
of
the
men
ninety
per
cent
in
ony
ballot
i
do
say
that
there
not
plenty
of
the
gentry
and
the
that
are
aye
reading
bits
of
newspapers
and
muddlin
their
wits
with
foreign
whigmaleeries
but
the
average
man
on
the
clyde
like
the
average
man
in
ither
places
hates
just
three
things
and
that
the
germans
the
profiteers
as
they
call
them
and
the
irish
but
he
hates
the
germans
first
irish
i
exclaimed
in
astonishment
the
irish
cried
the
last
of
the
old
border
radicals
stinkin
nowadays
with
two
things
money
and
irish
i
mind
the
day
when
i
followed
mr
gladstone
home
rule
policy
and
used
to
threep
about
the
noble
generous
sister
nation
held
in
a
foreign
bondage
my
goad
i
not
speakin
about
ulster
which
is
a
dour
den
but
our
own
folk
all
the
same
but
the
men
that
will
not
do
a
hand
turn
to
help
the
war
and
take
the
chance
of
our
necessities
to
set
up
a
bawbee
rebellion
are
hateful
to
goad
and
man
we
treated
them
like
pet
lambs
and
that
the
thanks
we
get
coming
over
here
in
thousands
to
tak
the
jobs
of
the
lads
that
are
doing
their
duty
i
was
speakin
last
week
to
a
widow
woman
that
keeps
a
wee
dairy
down
the
dalmarnock
road
she
has
two
sons
and
both
in
the
airmy
one
in
the
cameronians
and
one
a
prisoner
in
germany
she
was
telling
me
that
she
could
not
keep
goin
any
more
lacking
the
help
of
the
boys
though
she
had
worked
her
fingers
to
the
bone
surely
it
a
crool
job
mr
amos
she
says
that
the
goavernment
should
tak
baith
my
laddies
and
i
maybe
never
see
them
again
and
let
the
irish
gang
free
and
tak
the
bread
frae
our
mouth
at
the
gasworks
across
the
road
they
took
on
a
hundred
irish
last
week
and
every
yin
o
them
as
young
and
well
set
up
as
you
would
ask
to
see
and
my
wee
davie
him
in
germany
had
aye
a
weak
chest
and
jimmy
was
troubled
wi
a
bowel
complaint
that
surely
no
justice
he
broke
off
and
lit
a
match
by
drawing
it
across
the
seat
of
his
trousers
time
i
got
the
gas
lichtit
there
some
men
coming
here
at
as
the
gas
squealed
and
flickered
in
the
lighting
he
sketched
for
me
the
coming
guests
macnab
and
niven
two
o
my
colleagues
and
there
gilkison
of
the
and
a
lad
wilkie
he
got
consumption
and
writes
wee
bits
in
the
papers
and
there
a
queer
chap
o
the
name
o
tombs
they
tell
me
he
comes
frae
cambridge
and
is
a
kind
of
a
professor
there
anyway
he
more
stuffed
wi
havers
than
an
egg
wi
meat
he
telled
me
he
was
here
to
get
at
the
heart
o
the
workingman
and
i
said
to
him
that
he
would
hae
to
look
a
bit
further
than
the
sleeve
o
the
jaicket
there
no
muckle
in
his
head
poor
soul
then
there
be
tam
norie
him
that
edits
our
weekly
paper
for
tam
a
humorist
and
great
on
robert
burns
but
he
hasna
the
balance
o
a
dwinin
teetotum
ye
understand
mr
brand
that
i
keep
my
mouth
shut
in
such
company
and
do
express
my
own
views
more
than
is
absolutely
necessary
i
criticize
whiles
and
that
gives
me
a
name
of
whunstane
but
i
never
let
my
tongue
wag
the
feck
o
the
lads
comin
the
night
are
not
the
real
workingman
they
just
the
froth
on
the
pot
but
it
the
froth
that
will
be
useful
to
you
remember
they
heard
tell
o
ye
already
and
ye
some
sort
o
reputation
to
keep
up
mr
abel
gresson
be
here
i
asked
he
said
yet
him
and
me
havena
yet
got
to
the
point
payin
visits
but
the
men
that
come
will
be
gresson
friends
and
they
speak
of
ye
to
him
it
the
best
kind
of
introduction
ye
could
seek
the
knocker
sounded
and
mr
amos
hastened
to
admit
the
first
comers
these
were
macnab
and
wilkie
the
one
a
decent
man
with
a
face
and
a
celluloid
collar
the
other
a
youth
with
lank
hair
and
the
large
eyes
and
luminous
skin
which
are
the
marks
of
phthisis
is
mr
brand
boys
from
south
africa
was
amos
presentation
presently
came
niven
a
bearded
giant
and
mr
norie
the
editor
a
fat
dirty
fellow
smoking
a
rank
cigar
gilkison
of
the
when
he
arrived
proved
to
be
a
pleasant
young
man
in
spectacles
who
spoke
with
an
educated
voice
and
clearly
belonged
to
a
slightly
different
social
scale
last
came
tombs
the
cambridge
professor
a
lean
youth
with
a
sour
mouth
and
eyes
that
reminded
me
of
launcelot
wake
no
be
a
mawgnate
mr
brand
though
ye
come
from
south
africa
said
mr
norie
with
a
great
guffaw
me
i
a
working
engineer
i
said
father
was
from
scotland
and
this
is
my
first
visit
to
my
native
country
as
my
friend
mr
amos
was
telling
you
the
consumptive
looked
at
me
suspiciously
got
two
three
of
the
comrades
here
that
the
cawpitalist
government
expelled
from
the
transvaal
if
ye
our
way
of
thinking
ye
will
maybe
ken
them
i
said
i
would
be
overjoyed
to
meet
them
but
that
at
the
time
of
the
outrage
in
question
i
had
been
working
on
a
mine
a
thousand
miles
further
north
then
ensued
an
hour
of
extraordinary
talk
tombs
in
his
university
voice
was
concerned
to
get
information
he
asked
endless
questions
chiefly
of
gilkison
who
was
the
only
one
who
really
understood
his
language
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
anyone
quite
so
fluent
and
so
futile
and
yet
there
was
a
kind
of
feeble
violence
in
him
like
a
demented
sheep
he
was
engaged
in
venting
some
private
academic
spite
against
society
and
i
thought
that
in
a
revolution
he
would
be
the
class
of
lad
i
would
personally
conduct
to
the
nearest
and
all
the
while
amos
and
macnab
and
niven
carried
on
their
own
conversation
about
the
affairs
of
their
society
wholly
impervious
to
the
tornado
raging
around
them
it
was
mr
norie
the
editor
who
brought
me
into
the
discussion
south
african
friend
is
very
blate
he
said
in
his
boisterous
way
if
this
place
of
yours
was
so
damned
teetotal
and
we
had
a
dram
apiece
we
might
get
his
tongue
loosened
i
want
to
hear
what
he
got
to
say
about
the
war
you
told
me
this
morning
he
was
sound
in
the
faith
said
no
such
thing
said
mr
amos
ye
ken
well
tam
norie
i
do
judge
soundness
on
that
matter
as
you
judge
it
i
for
the
war
myself
subject
to
certain
conditions
that
i
often
stated
i
know
nothing
of
mr
brand
opinions
except
that
he
a
good
democrat
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
of
some
o
your
friends
to
andra
laughed
mr
norie
thinkin
the
inspector
in
the
socialist
state
would
be
a
waur
kind
of
awristocrat
then
the
duke
of
buccleuch
weel
there
maybe
something
in
that
but
about
the
war
he
wrong
ye
ken
my
views
boys
this
war
was
made
by
the
cawpitalists
and
it
has
been
fought
by
the
workers
and
it
the
workers
that
maun
have
the
ending
of
it
that
day
comin
very
near
there
are
those
that
want
to
spin
it
out
till
labour
is
that
weak
it
can
be
pit
in
chains
for
the
rest
o
time
that
the
manoeuvre
out
to
prevent
we
got
to
beat
the
germans
but
it
the
workers
that
has
the
right
to
judge
when
the
enemy
beaten
and
not
the
cawpitalists
what
do
you
say
mr
brand
mr
norie
had
obviously
pinned
his
colours
to
the
fence
but
he
gave
me
the
chance
i
had
been
looking
for
i
let
them
have
my
views
with
a
vengeance
and
these
views
were
that
for
the
sake
of
democracy
the
war
must
be
ended
i
flatter
myself
i
put
my
case
well
for
i
had
got
up
every
rotten
argument
and
i
borrowed
largely
from
launcelot
armoury
but
i
did
put
it
too
well
for
i
had
a
very
exact
notion
of
the
impression
i
wanted
to
produce
i
must
seem
to
be
honest
and
in
earnest
just
a
bit
of
a
fanatic
but
principally
a
businessman
who
knew
when
the
time
had
come
to
make
a
deal
tombs
kept
interrupting
me
with
imbecile
questions
and
i
had
to
sit
on
him
at
the
end
mr
norie
hammered
with
his
pipe
on
the
table
sort
ye
andra
ye
entertain
an
angel
unawares
what
do
ye
say
to
that
my
man
mr
amos
shook
his
head
no
deny
there
something
in
it
but
not
convinced
that
the
germans
have
got
enough
of
a
wheepin
macnab
agreed
with
him
the
others
were
with
me
norie
was
for
getting
me
to
write
an
article
for
his
paper
and
the
consumptive
wanted
me
to
address
a
meeting
ye
say
a
that
over
again
the
morn
night
down
at
our
hall
in
newmilns
street
we
got
a
lodge
meeting
o
the
and
i
make
them
pit
ye
in
the
programme
he
kept
his
luminous
eyes
like
a
sick
dog
fixed
on
me
and
i
saw
that
i
had
made
one
ally
i
told
him
i
had
come
to
glasgow
to
learn
and
not
to
teach
but
i
would
miss
no
chance
of
testifying
to
my
faith
boys
i
for
my
bed
said
amos
shaking
the
dottle
from
his
pipe
tombs
i
conduct
ye
the
morn
over
the
brigend
works
but
i
had
enough
clavers
for
one
evening
i
a
man
that
wants
his
eight
hours
sleep
the
old
fellow
saw
them
to
the
door
and
came
back
to
me
with
the
ghost
of
a
grin
in
his
face
queer
crowd
mr
brand
macnab
didna
like
what
ye
said
he
had
a
laddie
killed
in
gallypoly
and
he
no
lookin
for
peace
this
side
the
grave
he
my
best
friend
in
glasgow
he
an
elder
in
the
gaelic
kirk
in
the
cowcaddens
and
i
what
ye
call
a
but
wonderful
agreed
on
the
fundamentals
ye
spoke
your
bit
verra
well
i
must
admit
gresson
will
hear
tell
of
ye
as
a
promising
recruit
a
rotten
job
i
said
it
a
rotten
job
i
often
feel
like
vomiting
over
it
mysel
but
it
no
for
us
to
complain
there
waur
jobs
oot
in
france
for
better
men
a
word
in
your
ear
mr
brand
could
ye
not
look
a
bit
more
sheepish
ye
stare
folk
ower
straight
in
the
een
like
a
hieland
up
at
maryhill
barracks
and
he
winked
slowly
and
grotesquely
with
his
left
eye
he
marched
to
a
cupboard
and
produced
a
black
bottle
and
glass
myself
but
ye
be
the
better
of
something
to
tak
the
taste
out
of
your
mouth
there
loch
katrine
water
at
the
pipe
there
as
i
was
saying
there
not
much
ill
in
that
lot
tombs
is
a
black
offence
but
a
dominie
a
dominie
all
the
world
over
they
may
crack
about
their
industrial
workers
and
the
braw
things
they
going
to
do
but
there
a
wholesome
dampness
about
the
tinder
on
clydeside
they
should
try
ireland
i
said
was
a
really
clever
man
who
wanted
to
help
the
enemy
you
think
he
could
do
little
good
by
stirring
up
trouble
in
the
shops
here
positive
if
he
were
a
shrewd
fellow
he
soon
tumble
to
that
if
he
still
stayed
on
here
he
would
be
after
bigger
game
something
really
dangerous
and
damnable
amos
drew
down
his
brows
and
looked
me
in
the
face
see
what
ettlin
at
ay
that
would
be
my
conclusion
i
came
to
it
weeks
syne
about
the
man
ye
maybe
meet
the
morn
night
then
from
below
the
bed
he
pulled
a
box
from
which
he
drew
a
handsome
flute
forgive
me
mr
brand
but
i
aye
like
a
tune
before
i
go
to
my
bed
macnab
says
his
prayers
and
i
have
a
tune
on
the
flute
and
the
principle
is
just
the
same
so
that
singular
evening
closed
with
music
very
sweet
and
true
renderings
of
old
border
melodies
like
peggy
is
a
young
thing
and
the
kye
come
hame
i
fell
asleep
with
a
vision
of
amos
his
face
all
puckered
up
at
the
mouth
and
a
wandering
sentiment
in
his
eye
recapturing
in
his
dingy
world
the
emotions
of
a
boy
the
from
next
door
who
acted
as
cook
and
general
factotum
to
the
establishment
brought
me
shaving
water
next
morning
but
i
had
to
go
without
a
bath
when
i
entered
the
kitchen
i
found
no
one
there
but
while
i
consumed
the
inevitable
ham
and
egg
amos
arrived
back
for
breakfast
he
brought
with
him
the
paper
says
there
been
a
big
battle
at
eepers
he
announced
i
tore
open
the
sheet
and
read
of
the
great
attack
of
july
which
was
spoiled
by
the
weather
god
i
cried
got
st
julien
and
that
dirty
frezenberg
ridge
and
hooge
and
sanctuary
wood
i
know
every
inch
of
the
damned
place
brand
said
a
warning
voice
never
do
if
our
friends
last
night
heard
ye
talk
like
that
ye
might
as
well
tak
the
train
back
to
london
they
speakin
about
ye
in
the
yards
this
morning
ye
get
a
good
turnout
at
your
meeting
the
night
but
they
that
the
polis
will
interfere
that
mightna
be
a
bad
thing
but
i
trust
ye
to
show
discretion
for
ye
not
be
muckle
use
to
onybody
if
they
jyle
ye
in
duke
street
i
hear
gresson
will
be
there
with
a
fraternal
message
from
his
lunatics
in
america
i
arranged
that
ye
go
down
to
tam
norie
this
afternoon
and
give
him
a
hand
with
his
bit
paper
tam
will
tell
ye
the
whole
clash
o
the
west
country
and
i
look
to
ye
to
keep
him
off
the
drink
he
aye
arguin
that
writin
and
drinkin
gang
thegither
and
quotin
robert
burns
but
the
creature
has
a
wife
and
five
bairns
dependin
on
him
i
spent
a
fantastic
day
for
two
hours
i
sat
in
norie
dirty
den
while
he
smoked
and
orated
and
when
he
remembered
his
business
took
down
in
shorthand
my
impressions
of
the
labour
situation
in
south
africa
for
his
rag
they
were
fine
breezy
impressions
based
on
the
most
ignorance
and
if
they
ever
reached
the
rand
i
wonder
what
my
friends
there
made
of
cornelius
brand
their
author
i
stood
him
dinner
in
an
indifferent
in
a
street
off
the
broomielaw
and
thereafter
had
a
drink
with
him
in
a
and
was
introduced
to
some
of
his
less
reputable
friends
about
i
went
back
to
amos
lodgings
and
spent
an
hour
or
so
writing
a
long
letter
to
mr
ivery
i
described
to
him
everybody
i
had
met
i
gave
highly
coloured
views
of
the
explosive
material
on
the
clyde
and
i
deplored
the
lack
of
clearheadedness
in
the
progressive
forces
i
drew
an
elaborate
picture
of
amos
and
deduced
from
it
that
the
radicals
were
likely
to
be
a
bar
to
true
progress
have
switched
their
old
militancy
i
wrote
to
another
track
for
with
them
it
is
a
matter
of
conscience
to
be
always
militant
i
finished
up
with
some
very
crude
remarks
on
economics
culled
from
the
of
the
egregious
tombs
it
was
the
kind
of
letter
which
i
hoped
would
establish
my
character
in
his
mind
as
an
industrious
innocent
seven
found
me
in
newmilns
street
where
i
was
seized
upon
by
wilkie
he
had
put
on
a
clean
collar
for
the
occasion
and
had
partially
washed
his
thin
face
the
poor
fellow
had
a
cough
that
shook
him
like
the
walls
of
a
when
the
dynamos
are
going
he
was
very
apologetic
about
amos
belongs
to
a
past
worrld
he
said
has
a
big
reputation
in
his
society
and
he
a
fine
fighter
but
he
has
no
kind
of
vision
if
ye
understand
me
he
an
auld
gladstonian
and
that
done
and
damned
in
scotland
he
not
a
modern
mr
brand
like
you
and
me
but
tonight
ye
meet
one
or
two
chaps
that
be
worth
your
while
to
ken
ye
maybe
no
go
quite
as
far
as
them
but
ye
on
the
same
road
i
hoping
for
the
day
when
have
oor
councils
of
workmen
and
soldiers
like
the
russians
all
over
the
land
and
dictate
our
terms
to
the
pawrasites
in
pawrliament
they
tell
me
too
the
boys
in
the
trenches
are
comin
round
to
our
side
we
entered
the
hall
by
a
back
door
and
in
a
little
i
was
introduced
to
some
of
the
speakers
they
were
a
scratch
lot
as
seen
in
that
dingy
place
the
chairman
was
a
in
one
of
the
societies
a
fierce
little
rat
of
a
man
who
spoke
with
a
cockney
accent
and
addressed
me
as
but
one
of
them
roused
my
liveliest
interest
i
heard
the
name
of
gresson
and
turned
to
find
a
fellow
of
about
rather
sprucely
dressed
with
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
brand
he
said
in
a
rich
american
voice
which
recalled
blenkiron
pleased
to
meet
you
sir
we
have
come
from
remote
parts
of
the
globe
to
be
present
at
this
gathering
i
noticed
that
he
had
reddish
hair
and
small
bright
eyes
and
a
nose
with
a
droop
like
a
polish
jew
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
platform
i
saw
that
there
was
going
to
be
trouble
the
hall
was
packed
to
the
door
and
in
all
the
front
half
there
was
the
kind
of
audience
i
expected
to
see
of
the
political
type
who
before
the
war
would
have
thronged
to
party
meetings
but
not
all
the
crowd
at
the
back
had
come
to
listen
some
were
scallawags
some
looked
like
clerks
out
for
a
spree
and
there
was
a
fair
quantity
of
khaki
there
were
also
one
or
two
gentlemen
not
strictly
sober
the
chairman
began
by
putting
his
foot
in
it
he
said
we
were
there
tonight
to
protest
against
the
continuation
of
the
war
and
to
form
a
branch
of
the
new
british
council
of
workmen
and
soldiers
he
told
them
with
a
fine
mixture
of
metaphors
that
we
had
got
to
take
the
reins
into
our
own
hands
for
the
men
who
were
running
the
war
had
their
own
axes
to
grind
and
were
marching
to
oligarchy
through
the
blood
of
the
workers
he
added
that
we
had
no
quarrel
with
germany
half
as
bad
as
we
had
with
our
own
capitalists
he
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
british
soldiers
would
leap
from
their
trenches
and
extend
the
hand
of
friendship
to
their
german
comrades
me
said
a
solemn
voice
not
seekin
a
bullet
in
my
wame
at
which
there
was
laughter
and
tombs
followed
and
made
a
worse
hash
of
it
he
was
determined
to
speak
as
he
would
have
put
it
to
democracy
in
its
own
language
so
he
said
several
times
loudly
but
without
conviction
presently
he
slipped
into
the
manner
of
the
lecturer
and
the
audience
grew
restless
propose
to
ask
myself
a
question
he
began
and
from
the
back
of
the
hall
came
a
damned
sully
answer
ye
get
after
that
there
was
no
more
tombs
i
followed
with
extreme
nervousness
and
to
my
surprise
got
a
fair
hearing
i
felt
as
mean
as
a
mangy
dog
on
a
cold
morning
for
i
hated
to
talk
rot
before
soldiers
especially
before
a
couple
of
royal
scots
fusiliers
who
for
all
i
knew
might
have
been
in
my
own
brigade
my
line
was
the
plain
practical
patriotic
man
just
come
from
the
colonies
who
looked
at
things
with
fresh
eyes
and
called
for
a
new
deal
i
was
very
moderate
but
to
justify
my
appearance
there
i
had
to
put
in
a
wild
patch
or
two
and
i
got
these
by
impassioned
attacks
on
the
ministry
of
munitions
i
mixed
up
a
little
mild
praise
of
the
germans
whom
i
said
i
had
known
all
over
the
world
for
decent
fellows
i
received
little
applause
but
no
marked
dissent
and
sat
down
with
deep
thankfulness
the
next
speaker
put
the
lid
on
it
i
believe
he
was
a
noted
agitator
who
had
already
been
deported
towards
him
there
was
no
lukewarmness
for
one
half
of
the
audience
cheered
wildly
when
he
rose
and
the
other
half
hissed
and
groaned
he
began
with
whirlwind
abuse
of
the
idle
rich
then
of
the
he
called
them
the
flunkeys
and
finally
of
the
government
all
that
was
fairly
well
received
for
it
is
the
fashion
of
the
briton
to
run
down
every
government
and
yet
to
be
very
averse
to
parting
from
it
then
he
started
on
the
soldiers
and
slanged
the
officers
pups
was
his
name
for
them
and
the
generals
whom
he
accused
of
idleness
of
cowardice
and
of
habitual
intoxication
he
told
us
that
our
own
kith
and
kin
were
sacrificed
in
every
battle
by
leaders
who
had
not
the
guts
to
share
their
risks
the
scots
fusiliers
looked
perturbed
as
if
they
were
in
doubt
of
his
meaning
then
he
put
it
more
plainly
any
soldier
deny
that
the
men
are
the
barrage
to
keep
the
officers
skins
whole
a
bloody
lee
said
one
of
the
fusilier
jocks
the
man
took
no
notice
of
the
interruption
being
carried
away
by
the
torrent
of
his
own
rhetoric
but
he
had
not
allowed
for
the
persistence
of
the
interrupter
the
jock
got
slowly
to
his
feet
and
announced
that
he
wanted
satisfaction
ye
open
your
dirty
gab
to
blagyird
honest
men
i
come
up
on
the
platform
and
wring
your
neck
at
that
there
was
a
fine
old
row
some
crying
out
some
play
and
some
applauding
a
canadian
at
the
back
of
the
hall
started
a
song
and
there
was
an
ugly
press
forward
the
hall
seemed
to
be
moving
up
from
the
back
and
already
men
were
standing
in
all
the
passages
and
right
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
i
did
not
like
the
look
in
the
eyes
of
these
and
among
the
crowd
i
saw
several
who
were
obviously
policemen
the
chairman
whispered
a
word
to
the
speaker
who
continued
when
the
noise
had
temporarily
died
down
he
kept
off
the
army
and
returned
to
the
government
and
for
a
little
sluiced
out
pure
anarchism
but
he
got
his
foot
in
it
again
for
he
pointed
to
the
sinn
feiners
as
examples
of
manly
independence
at
that
pandemonium
broke
loose
and
he
never
had
another
look
in
there
were
several
fights
going
on
in
the
hall
between
the
public
and
courageous
supporters
of
the
orator
then
gresson
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
retrieve
the
day
i
must
say
he
did
it
uncommonly
well
he
was
clearly
a
practised
speaker
and
for
a
moment
his
appeal
boys
let
cool
down
a
bit
and
talk
sense
had
an
effect
but
the
mischief
had
been
done
and
the
crowd
was
surging
round
the
lonely
redoubt
where
we
sat
besides
i
could
see
that
for
all
his
clever
talk
the
meeting
did
not
like
the
look
of
him
he
was
as
mild
as
a
turtle
dove
but
they
would
stand
for
it
a
missile
hurtled
past
my
nose
and
i
saw
a
rotten
cabbage
envelop
the
baldish
head
of
the
someone
reached
out
a
long
arm
and
grabbed
a
chair
and
with
it
took
the
legs
from
gresson
then
the
lights
suddenly
went
out
and
we
retreated
in
good
order
by
the
platform
door
with
a
yelling
crowd
at
our
heels
it
was
here
that
the
men
came
in
handy
they
held
the
door
while
the
was
smuggled
out
by
some
side
entrance
that
class
of
lad
would
soon
cease
to
exist
but
for
the
protection
of
the
law
which
he
would
abolish
the
rest
of
us
having
less
to
fear
were
suffered
to
leak
into
newmilns
street
i
found
myself
next
to
gresson
and
took
his
arm
there
was
something
hard
in
his
coat
pocket
unfortunately
there
was
a
big
lamp
at
the
point
where
we
emerged
and
there
for
our
confusion
were
the
fusilier
jocks
both
were
strung
to
fighting
pitch
and
were
determined
to
have
someone
blood
of
me
they
took
no
notice
but
gresson
had
spoken
after
their
ire
had
been
roused
and
was
marked
out
as
a
victim
with
a
howl
of
joy
they
rushed
for
him
i
felt
his
hand
steal
to
his
that
alone
you
fool
i
growled
in
his
ear
mister
he
said
and
the
next
second
we
were
in
the
thick
of
it
it
was
like
so
many
street
fights
i
have
seen
an
immense
crowd
which
surged
up
around
us
and
yet
left
a
clear
ring
gresson
and
i
got
against
the
wall
on
the
and
faced
the
furious
soldiery
my
intention
was
to
do
as
little
as
possible
but
the
first
minute
convinced
me
that
my
companion
had
no
idea
how
to
use
his
fists
and
i
was
mortally
afraid
that
he
would
get
busy
with
the
gun
in
his
pocket
it
was
that
fear
that
brought
me
into
the
scrap
the
jocks
were
sportsmen
every
bit
of
them
and
only
one
advanced
to
the
combat
he
hit
gresson
a
clip
on
the
jaw
with
his
left
and
but
for
the
wall
would
have
laid
him
out
i
saw
in
the
lamplight
the
vicious
gleam
in
the
american
eye
and
the
twitch
of
his
hand
to
his
pocket
that
decided
me
to
interfere
and
i
got
in
front
of
him
this
brought
the
second
jock
into
the
fray
he
was
a
broad
thickset
fellow
of
the
adorable
stocky
type
that
i
had
seen
go
through
the
railway
triangle
at
arras
as
though
it
were
he
had
some
notion
of
fighting
too
and
gave
me
a
rough
time
for
i
had
to
keep
edging
the
other
fellow
off
gresson
home
you
fool
i
shouted
this
gentleman
alone
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
the
only
answer
was
a
which
i
just
managed
to
guard
followed
by
a
mighty
drive
with
his
right
which
i
dodged
so
that
he
barked
his
knuckles
on
the
wall
i
heard
a
yell
of
rage
and
observed
that
gresson
seemed
to
have
kicked
his
assailant
on
the
shin
i
began
to
long
for
the
police
then
there
was
that
swaying
of
the
crowd
which
betokens
the
approach
of
the
forces
of
law
and
order
but
they
were
too
late
to
prevent
trouble
in
i
had
to
take
my
jock
seriously
and
got
in
my
blow
when
he
had
overreached
himself
and
lost
his
balance
i
never
hit
anyone
so
unwillingly
in
my
life
he
went
over
like
a
poled
ox
and
measured
his
length
on
the
causeway
i
found
myself
explaining
things
politely
to
the
constables
men
objected
to
this
gentleman
speech
at
the
meeting
and
i
had
to
interfere
to
protect
him
no
no
i
do
want
to
charge
anybody
it
was
all
a
misunderstanding
i
helped
the
stricken
jock
to
rise
and
offered
him
ten
bob
for
consolation
he
looked
at
me
sullenly
and
spat
on
the
ground
your
dirty
money
he
said
be
even
with
ye
yet
my
man
you
and
that
scab
i
mind
the
looks
of
ye
the
next
time
i
see
ye
gresson
was
wiping
the
blood
from
his
cheek
with
a
silk
handkerchief
guess
i
in
your
debt
mr
brand
he
said
may
bet
i
forget
it
i
returned
to
an
anxious
amos
he
heard
my
story
in
silence
and
his
only
comment
was
done
the
fusiliers
might
have
been
worse
i
not
deny
he
went
on
established
some
kind
of
a
claim
upon
gresson
which
may
come
in
handy
speaking
about
gresson
i
news

of

a
cousin
of
the
name
of
ochterlony
chapter
five
various
doings
in
the
west
the
was
no
ship
for
passengers
its
decks
were
littered
with
a
hundred
oddments
so
that
a
man
could
barely
walk
a
step
without
tacking
and
my
bunk
was
simply
a
shelf
in
the
frowsty
little
saloon
where
the
odour
of
ham
and
eggs
hung
like
a
fog
i
joined
her
at
greenock
and
took
a
turn
on
deck
with
the
captain
after
tea
when
he
told
me
the
names
of
the
big
blue
hills
to
the
north
he
had
a
fine
old
face
and
like
an
archbishop
and
having
spent
all
his
days
beating
up
the
western
seas
had
as
many
yarns
in
his
head
as
peter
himself
this
boat
he
announced
do
ken
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
i
may
put
into
colonsay
for
twa
hours
and
bide
there
three
days
i
get
a
telegram
at
oban
and
the
next
thing
i
awa
ayont
barra
sheep
the
difficult
business
they
maun
be
fetched
for
the
sales
and
dooms
slow
to
lift
so
ye
see
it
not
what
ye
call
a
pleasure
trip
maister
brand
indeed
it
was
for
the
confounded
tub
wallowed
like
a
fat
sow
as
soon
as
we
rounded
a
headland
and
got
the
weight
of
the
wind
when
asked
my
purpose
i
explained
that
i
was
a
colonial
of
scots
extraction
who
was
paying
his
first
visit
to
his
fatherland
and
wanted
to
explore
the
beauties
of
the
west
highlands
i
let
him
gather
that
i
was
not
rich
in
this
world
goods
have
a
passport
he
asked
no
let
ye
go
north
o
fort
william
without
one
amos
had
said
nothing
about
passports
so
i
looked
blank
could
keep
ye
on
board
for
the
whole
voyage
he
went
on
ye
wouldna
be
permitted
to
land
if
ye
seekin
enjoyment
it
would
be
a
poor
job
sittin
on
this
deck
and
admirin
the
works
o
god
and
no
allowed
to
step
on
the
ye
should
have
applied
to
the
military
gentlemen
in
glesca
but
ye
plenty
o
time
to
make
up
your
mind
afore
we
get
to
oban
we
a
heap
o
calls
to
make
mull
and
islay
way
the
purser
came
up
to
inquire
about
my
ticket
and
greeted
me
with
a
grin
acquaint
with
mr
gresson
then
said
the
captain
a
cheery
wee
ship
company
and
that
the
great
thing
on
this
kind
job
i
made
but
a
poor
supper
for
the
wind
had
risen
to
half
a
gale
and
i
saw
hours
of
wretchedness
approaching
the
trouble
with
me
is
that
i
can
not
be
honestly
sick
and
get
it
over
queasiness
and
headache
beset
me
and
there
is
no
refuge
but
bed
i
turned
into
my
bunk
leaving
the
captain
and
the
mate
smoking
shag
not
six
feet
from
my
head
and
fell
into
a
restless
sleep
when
i
woke
the
place
was
empty
and
smelt
vilely
of
stale
tobacco
and
cheese
my
throbbing
brows
made
sleep
impossible
and
i
tried
to
ease
them
by
staggering
upon
deck
i
saw
a
clear
windy
sky
with
every
star
as
bright
as
a
live
coal
and
a
heaving
waste
of
dark
waters
running
to
hills
then
a
douche
of
spray
caught
me
and
sent
me
down
the
companion
to
my
bunk
again
where
i
lay
for
hours
trying
to
make
a
plan
of
campaign
i
argued
that
if
amos
had
wanted
me
to
have
a
passport
he
would
have
provided
one
so
i
need
bother
my
head
about
that
but
it
was
my
business
to
keep
alongside
gresson
and
if
the
boat
stayed
a
week
in
some
port
and
he
went
off
ashore
i
must
follow
him
having
no
passport
i
would
have
to
be
always
dodging
trouble
which
would
handicap
my
movements
and
in
all
likelihood
make
me
more
conspicuous
than
i
wanted
i
guessed
that
amos
had
denied
me
the
passport
for
the
very
reason
that
he
wanted
gresson
to
think
me
harmless
the
area
of
danger
would
therefore
be
the
passport
country
somewhere
north
of
fort
william
but
to
follow
gresson
i
must
run
risks
and
enter
that
country
his
suspicions
if
he
had
any
would
be
lulled
if
i
left
the
boat
at
oban
but
it
was
up
to
me
to
follow
overland
to
the
north
and
hit
the
place
where
the
made
a
long
stay
the
confounded
tub
had
no
plans
she
wandered
about
the
west
highlands
looking
for
sheep
and
things
and
the
captain
himself
could
give
me
no
of
her
voyage
it
was
incredible
that
gresson
should
take
all
this
trouble
if
he
did
not
know
that
at
some
place
and
the
right
place
he
would
have
time
to
get
a
spell
ashore
but
i
could
scarcely
ask
gresson
for
that
information
though
i
determined
to
cast
a
wary
fly
over
him
i
knew
roughly
the
course
through
the
sound
of
islay
to
colonsay
then
up
the
east
side
of
mull
to
oban
then
through
the
sound
of
mull
to
the
islands
with
names
like
cocktails
rum
and
eigg
and
coll
then
to
skye
and
then
for
the
outer
hebrides
i
thought
the
last
would
be
the
place
and
it
seemed
madness
to
leave
the
boat
for
the
lord
knew
how
i
should
get
across
the
minch
this
consideration
upset
all
my
plans
again
and
i
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
without
coming
to
any
conclusion
morning
found
us
nosing
between
jura
and
islay
and
about
midday
we
touched
at
a
little
port
where
we
unloaded
some
cargo
and
took
on
a
couple
of
shepherds
who
were
going
to
colonsay
the
mellow
afternoon
and
the
good
smell
of
salt
and
heather
got
rid
of
the
dregs
of
my
queasiness
and
i
spent
a
profitable
hour
on
the
with
a
called
and
one
of
bartholomew
maps
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
amos
might
be
able
to
tell
me
something
for
a
talk
with
the
captain
had
suggested
that
the
would
not
dally
long
in
the
neighbourhood
of
rum
and
eigg
the
big
droving
season
was
scarcely
on
yet
and
sheep
for
the
oban
market
would
be
lifted
on
the
return
journey
in
that
case
skye
was
the
first
place
to
watch
and
if
i
could
get
wind
of
any
big
cargo
waiting
there
i
would
be
able
to
make
a
plan
amos
was
somewhere
near
the
kyle
and
that
was
across
the
narrows
from
skye
looking
at
the
map
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
spite
of
being
passportless
i
might
be
able
somehow
to
make
my
way
up
through
morvern
and
arisaig
to
the
latitude
of
skye
the
difficulty
would
be
to
get
across
the
strip
of
sea
but
there
must
be
boats
to
beg
borrow
or
steal
i
was
poring
over
baddely
when
gresson
sat
down
beside
me
he
was
in
a
good
temper
and
disposed
to
talk
and
to
my
surprise
his
talk
was
all
about
the
beauties
of
the
countryside
there
was
a
kind
of
light
over
everything
the
steep
heather
hills
cut
into
the
sky
like
purple
amethysts
while
beyond
the
straits
the
western
ocean
stretched
its
pale
molten
gold
to
the
sunset
gresson
waxed
lyrical
over
the
scene
just
about
puts
me
right
inside
mr
brand
i
got
to
get
away
from
that
little
old
town
pretty
frequent
or
i
begin
to
moult
like
a
canary
a
man
feels
a
man
when
he
gets
to
a
place
that
smells
as
good
as
this
why
in
hell
do
we
ever
get
messed
up
in
those
stone
and
lime
cages
i
reckon
some
day
i
pull
my
freight
for
a
clean
location
and
settle
down
there
and
make
little
poems
this
place
would
about
content
me
and
there
a
spot
out
in
california
in
the
coast
ranges
that
been
keeping
my
eye
on
the
odd
thing
was
that
i
believe
he
meant
it
his
ugly
face
was
lit
up
with
a
serious
delight
he
told
me
he
had
taken
this
voyage
before
so
i
got
out
baddely
and
asked
for
advice
ca
spend
too
much
time
on
holidaying
i
told
him
i
want
to
see
all
the
beauty
spots
but
the
best
of
them
seem
to
be
in
the
area
that
this
fool
british
government
wo
let
you
into
without
a
passport
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
leave
you
at
oban
bad
he
said
sympathetically
they
tell
me
there
some
pretty
sights
round
oban
and
he
thumbed
the
and
began
to
read
about
glencoe
i
said
that
was
not
my
purpose
and
pitched
him
a
yarn
about
prince
charlie
and
how
my
mother
had
played
some
kind
of
part
in
that
show
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
see
the
place
where
the
prince
landed
and
where
he
left
for
france
far
as
i
can
make
out
that
wo
take
me
into
the
passport
country
but
i
have
to
do
a
bit
of
footslogging
well
i
used
to
padding
the
hoof
i
must
get
the
captain
to
put
me
off
in
morvern
and
then
i
can
foot
it
round
the
top
of
lochiel
and
get
back
to
oban
through
appin
how
that
for
a
holiday
trek
he
gave
the
scheme
his
approval
if
it
was
me
mr
brand
i
would
have
a
shot
at
puzzling
your
gallant
policemen
you
and
i
do
take
much
stock
in
governments
and
their
laws
and
it
would
be
a
good
game
to
see
just
how
far
you
could
get
into
the
forbidden
land
a
man
like
you
could
put
up
a
good
bluff
on
those
hayseeds
i
do
mind
having
a
bet
i
said
out
for
a
rest
and
not
for
sport
if
there
was
anything
to
be
gained
i
undertake
to
bluff
my
way
to
the
orkney
islands
but
it
a
wearing
job
and
i
better
things
to
think
about
well
enjoy
yourself
your
own
way
i
be
sorry
when
you
leave
us
for
i
owe
you
something
for
that
and
beside
darned
little
company
in
the
old
captain
that
evening
gresson
and
i
swopped
yarns
after
supper
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
goad
and
possible
of
captain
and
mate
i
went
to
bed
after
a
glass
or
two
of
weak
grog
and
made
up
for
the
last
night
vigil
by
falling
sound
asleep
i
had
very
little
kit
with
me
beyond
what
i
stood
up
in
and
could
carry
in
my
waterproof
pockets
but
on
amos
advice
i
had
brought
my
little
revolver
this
lived
by
day
in
my
hip
pocket
but
at
night
i
put
it
behind
my
pillow
but
when
i
woke
next
morning
to
find
us
casting
anchor
in
the
bay
below
rough
low
hills
which
i
knew
to
be
the
island
of
colonsay
i
could
find
no
trace
of
the
revolver
i
searched
every
inch
of
the
bunk
and
only
shook
out
feathers
from
the
mouldy
ticking
i
remembered
perfectly
putting
the
thing
behind
my
head
before
i
went
to
sleep
and
now
it
had
vanished
utterly
of
course
i
could
not
advertise
my
loss
and
i
did
greatly
mind
it
for
this
was
not
a
job
where
i
could
do
much
shooting
but
it
made
me
think
a
good
deal
about
mr
gresson
he
simply
could
not
suspect
me
if
he
had
bagged
my
gun
as
i
was
pretty
certain
he
had
it
must
be
because
he
wanted
it
for
himself
and
not
that
he
might
disarm
me
every
way
i
argued
it
i
reached
the
same
conclusion
in
gresson
eyes
i
must
seem
as
harmless
as
a
child
we
spent
the
better
part
of
a
day
at
colonsay
and
gresson
so
far
as
his
duties
allowed
stuck
to
me
like
a
limpet
before
i
went
ashore
i
wrote
out
a
telegram
for
amos
i
devoted
a
hectic
hour
to
the
but
i
could
not
compose
any
kind
of
intelligible
message
with
reference
to
its
text
we
had
all
the
same
edition
the
one
in
the
series
so
i
could
have
made
up
a
sort
of
cipher
by
referring
to
lines
and
pages
but
that
would
have
taken
up
a
dozen
telegraph
forms
and
seemed
to
me
too
elaborate
for
the
purpose
so
i
sent
this
message
post
office
kyle
i
hope
to
spend
part
of
holiday
near
you
and
to
see
you
if
programme
permits
are
any
good
cargoes
waiting
in
your
neighbourhood
reply
post
office
it
was
highly
important
that
gresson
should
not
see
this
but
it
was
the
deuce
of
a
business
to
shake
him
off
i
went
for
a
walk
in
the
afternoon
along
the
shore
and
passed
the
telegraph
office
but
the
confounded
fellow
was
with
me
all
the
time
my
only
chance
was
just
before
we
sailed
when
he
had
to
go
on
board
to
check
some
cargo
as
the
telegraph
office
stood
full
in
view
of
the
ship
deck
i
did
not
go
near
it
but
in
the
back
end
of
the
clachan
i
found
the
schoolmaster
and
got
him
to
promise
to
send
the
wire
i
also
bought
off
him
a
couple
of
sevenpenny
novels
the
result
was
that
i
delayed
our
departure
for
ten
minutes
and
when
i
came
on
board
faced
a
wrathful
gresson
the
hell
have
you
been
he
asked
weather
blowing
up
dirty
and
the
old
man
mad
to
get
off
did
you
get
your
legs
stretched
enough
this
afternoon
i
explained
humbly
that
i
had
been
to
the
schoolmaster
to
get
something
to
read
and
produced
my
dingy
red
volumes
at
that
his
brow
cleared
i
could
see
that
his
suspicions
were
set
at
rest
we
left
colonsay
about
six
in
the
evening
with
the
sky
behind
us
banking
for
a
storm
and
the
hills
of
jura
to
starboard
an
angry
purple
colonsay
was
too
low
an
island
to
be
any
kind
of
breakwater
against
a
western
gale
so
the
weather
was
bad
from
the
start
our
course
was
north
by
east
and
when
we
had
passed
the
of
the
island
we
nosed
about
in
the
trough
of
big
seas
shipping
tons
of
water
and
rolling
like
a
buffalo
i
know
as
much
about
boats
as
about
egyptian
hieroglyphics
but
even
my
landsman
eyes
could
tell
that
we
were
in
for
a
rough
night
i
was
determined
not
to
get
queasy
again
but
when
i
went
below
the
smell
of
tripe
and
onions
promised
to
be
my
undoing
so
i
dined
off
a
slab
of
chocolate
and
a
cabin
biscuit
put
on
my
waterproof
and
resolved
to
stick
it
out
on
deck
i
took
up
position
near
the
bows
where
i
was
out
of
reach
of
the
oily
steamer
smells
it
was
as
fresh
as
the
top
of
a
mountain
but
mighty
cold
and
wet
for
a
gusty
drizzle
had
set
in
and
i
got
the
spindrift
of
the
big
waves
there
i
balanced
myself
as
we
lurched
into
the
twilight
hanging
on
with
one
hand
to
a
rope
which
descended
from
the
stumpy
mast
i
noticed
that
there
was
only
an
indifferent
rail
between
me
and
the
edge
but
that
interested
me
and
helped
to
keep
off
sickness
i
swung
to
the
movement
of
the
vessel
and
though
i
was
mortally
cold
it
was
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
my
notion
was
to
get
the
nausea
whipped
out
of
me
by
the
weather
and
when
i
was
properly
tired
to
go
down
and
turn
in
i
stood
there
till
the
dark
had
fallen
by
that
time
i
was
an
automaton
the
way
a
man
gets
on
and
i
could
have
easily
hung
on
till
morning
my
thoughts
ranged
about
the
earth
beginning
with
the
business
i
had
set
out
on
and
presently
by
way
of
recollections
of
blenkiron
and
peter
reaching
the
german
forest
where
in
the
christmas
of
i
had
been
nearly
done
in
by
fever
and
old
stumm
i
remembered
the
bitter
cold
of
that
wild
race
and
the
way
the
snow
seemed
to
burn
like
fire
when
i
stumbled
and
got
my
face
into
it
i
reflected
that
was
kitten
play
to
a
good
bout
of
malaria
the
weather
was
growing
worse
and
i
was
getting
more
than
spindrift
from
the
seas
i
hooked
my
arm
round
the
rope
for
my
fingers
were
numbing
then
i
fell
to
dreaming
again
principally
about
fosse
manor
and
mary
lamington
this
so
ravished
me
that
i
was
as
good
as
asleep
i
was
trying
to
reconstruct
the
picture
as
i
had
last
seen
her
at
biggleswick
station
a
heavy
body
collided
with
me
and
shook
my
arm
from
the
rope
i
slithered
across
the
yard
of
deck
engulfed
in
a
whirl
of
water
one
foot
caught
a
stanchion
of
the
rail
and
it
gave
with
me
so
that
for
an
instant
i
was
more
than
half
overboard
but
my
fingers
clawed
wildly
and
caught
in
the
links
of
what
must
have
been
the
anchor
chain
they
held
though
a
ton
weight
seemed
to
be
tugging
at
my
feet
then
the
old
tub
rolled
back
the
waters
slipped
off
and
i
was
sprawling
on
a
wet
deck
with
no
breath
in
me
and
a
gallon
of
brine
in
my
windpipe
i
heard
a
voice
cry
out
sharply
and
a
hand
helped
me
to
my
feet
it
was
gresson
and
he
seemed
excited
mr
brand
that
was
a
close
call
i
was
coming
up
to
find
you
when
this
damned
ship
took
to
lying
on
her
side
i
guess
i
must
have
cannoned
into
you
and
i
was
calling
myself
bad
names
when
i
saw
you
rolling
into
the
atlantic
if
i
had
got
a
grip
on
the
rope
i
would
have
been
down
beside
you
say
you
not
hurt
i
reckon
you
better
come
below
and
get
a
glass
of
rum
under
your
belt
you
about
as
wet
as
mother
there
one
advantage
about
campaigning
you
take
your
luck
when
it
comes
and
do
worry
about
what
might
have
been
i
did
think
any
more
of
the
business
except
that
it
had
cured
me
of
wanting
to
be
i
went
down
to
the
reeking
cabin
without
one
qualm
in
my
stomach
and
ate
a
good
meal
of
and
bottled
bass
with
a
tot
of
rum
to
follow
up
with
then
i
shed
my
wet
garments
and
slept
in
my
bunk
till
we
anchored
off
a
village
in
mull
in
a
clear
blue
morning
it
took
us
four
days
to
crawl
up
that
coast
and
make
oban
for
we
seemed
to
be
a
floating
general
store
for
every
hamlet
in
those
parts
gresson
made
himself
very
pleasant
as
if
he
wanted
to
atone
for
nearly
doing
me
in
we
played
some
poker
and
i
read
the
little
books
i
had
got
in
colonsay
and
then
rigged
up
a
and
caught
saithe
and
lythe
and
an
occasional
big
haddock
but
i
found
the
time
pass
slowly
and
i
was
glad
that
about
noon
one
day
we
came
into
a
bay
blocked
with
islands
and
saw
a
clean
little
town
sitting
on
the
hills
and
the
smoke
of
a
railway
engine
i
went
ashore
and
purchased
a
better
brand
of
hat
in
a
tweed
store
then
i
made
a
for
the
post
office
and
asked
for
telegrams
one
was
given
to
me
and
as
i
opened
it
i
saw
gresson
at
my
elbow
it
read
thus
post
office
oban
page
paragraph
i
passed
it
to
gresson
with
a
rueful
face
a
piece
of
foolishness
i
said
got
a
cousin
who
a
presbyterian
minister
up
in
and
before
i
knew
about
this
passport
humbug
i
wrote
to
him
and
offered
to
pay
him
a
visit
i
told
him
to
wire
me
here
if
it
was
convenient
and
the
old
idiot
has
sent
me
the
wrong
telegram
this
was
likely
as
not
meant
for
some
other
brother
parson
who
got
my
message
instead
the
guy
name
gresson
asked
curiously
peering
at
the
signature
david
ochterlony
he
a
great
swell
at
writing
books
but
he
no
earthly
use
at
handling
the
telegraph
however
it
signify
seeing
i
not
going
near
him
i
crumpled
up
the
pink
form
and
tossed
it
on
the
floor
gresson
and
i
walked
to
the
together
that
afternoon
when
i
got
a
chance
i
had
out
my
page
paragraph
read
i
saw
in
my
dream
that
a
little
off
the
road
over
against
the
stood
demas
gentlemanlike
to
call
to
passengers
to
come
and
see
who
said
to
christian
and
his
fellow
ho
turn
aside
hither
and
i
will
show
you
a
at
tea
i
led
the
talk
to
my
own
past
life
i
yarned
about
my
experiences
as
a
mining
engineer
and
said
i
could
never
get
out
of
the
trick
of
looking
at
country
with
the
eye
of
the
prospector
instance
i
said
this
had
been
rhodesia
i
would
have
said
there
was
a
good
chance
of
copper
in
these
little
kopjes
above
the
town
they
not
unlike
the
hills
round
the
messina
mine
i
told
the
captain
that
after
the
war
i
was
thinking
of
turning
my
attention
to
the
west
highlands
and
looking
out
for
minerals
make
nothing
of
it
said
the
captain
costs
are
ower
big
even
if
ye
found
the
minerals
for
ye
have
to
import
a
your
labour
the
west
hielandman
is
no
fond
o
hard
work
ye
ken
the
psalm
o
the
crofter
that
the
peats
would
cut
themselves
the
fish
chump
on
the
shore
and
that
i
in
my
bed
might
lie
henceforth
for
ever
more
it
ever
been
tried
i
asked
there
marble
and
slate
quarries
and
there
was
word
o
coal
in
benbecula
and
there
the
iron
mines
at
ranna
that
i
asked
forenent
skye
we
call
in
there
and
generally
bide
a
bit
a
heap
of
cargo
for
ranna
and
we
usually
get
a
good
load
back
but
as
i
tell
ye
there
few
hielanders
working
there
mostly
irish
and
lads
frae
fife
and
falkirk
way
i
did
pursue
the
subject
for
i
had
found
demas
if
the
lay
at
ranna
for
a
week
gresson
would
have
time
to
do
his
own
private
business
ranna
would
not
be
the
spot
for
the
island
was
bare
to
the
world
in
the
middle
of
a
channel
but
skye
was
just
across
the
way
and
when
i
looked
in
my
map
at
its
big
wandering
peninsulas
i
concluded
that
my
guess
had
been
right
and
that
skye
was
the
place
to
make
for
that
night
i
sat
on
deck
with
gresson
and
in
a
wonderful
starry
silence
we
watched
the
lights
die
out
of
the
houses
in
the
town
and
talked
of
a
thousand
things
i
noticed
what
i
had
had
a
hint
of
before
that
my
companion
was
no
common
man
there
were
moments
when
he
forgot
himself
and
talked
like
an
educated
gentleman
then
he
would
remember
and
relapse
into
the
lingo
of
leadville
colorado
in
my
character
of
the
ingenuous
inquirer
i
set
him
posers
about
politics
and
economics
the
kind
of
thing
i
might
have
been
supposed
to
pick
up
from
unintelligent
browsing
among
little
books
generally
he
answered
with
some
slangy
catchword
but
occasionally
he
was
interested
beyond
his
discretion
and
treated
me
to
a
harangue
like
an
equal
i
discovered
another
thing
that
he
had
a
craze
for
poetry
and
a
capacious
memory
for
it
i
forgot
how
we
drifted
into
the
subject
but
i
remember
he
quoted
some
queer
haunting
stuff
which
he
said
was
swinburne
and
verses
by
people
i
had
heard
of
from
letchford
at
biggleswick
then
he
saw
by
my
silence
that
he
had
gone
too
far
and
fell
back
into
the
jargon
of
the
west
he
wanted
to
know
about
my
plans
and
we
went
down
into
the
cabin
and
had
a
look
at
the
map
i
explained
my
route
up
morvern
and
round
the
head
of
lochiel
and
back
to
oban
by
the
east
side
of
loch
linnhe
you
he
said
a
hell
of
a
walk
before
you
that
bug
never
bit
me
and
i
guess
i
not
envying
you
any
and
after
that
mr
brand
to
glasgow
to
do
some
work
for
the
cause
i
said
lightly
so
he
said
with
a
grin
a
great
life
if
you
do
weaken
we
steamed
out
of
the
bay
next
morning
at
dawn
and
about
nine
i
got
on
shore
at
a
little
place
called
lochaline
my
kit
was
all
on
my
person
and
my
waterproof
pockets
were
stuffed
with
chocolates
and
biscuits
i
had
bought
in
oban
the
captain
was
discouraging
get
your
bellyful
o
hieland
hills
mr
brand
afore
ye
win
round
the
loch
head
ye
be
wishin
yerself
back
on
the
but
gresson
speeded
me
joyfully
on
my
way
and
said
he
wished
he
were
coming
with
me
he
even
accompanied
me
the
first
hundred
yards
and
waved
his
hat
after
me
till
i
was
round
the
turn
of
the
road
the
first
stage
in
that
journey
was
pure
delight
i
was
thankful
to
be
rid
of
the
infernal
boat
and
the
hot
summer
scents
coming
down
the
glen
were
comforting
after
the
cold
salt
smell
of
the
sea
the
road
lay
up
the
side
of
a
small
bay
at
the
top
of
which
a
big
white
house
stood
among
gardens
presently
i
had
left
the
coast
and
was
in
a
glen
where
a
brown
swirled
through
acres
of
it
had
its
source
in
a
loch
from
which
the
mountain
rose
steeply
a
place
so
glassy
in
that
august
forenoon
that
every
scar
and
wrinkle
of
the
hillside
were
faithfully
reflected
after
that
i
crossed
a
low
pass
to
the
head
of
another
and
following
the
map
struck
over
the
shoulder
of
a
great
hill
and
ate
my
luncheon
far
up
on
its
side
with
a
wonderful
vista
of
wood
and
water
below
me
all
that
morning
i
was
very
happy
not
thinking
about
gresson
or
ivery
but
getting
my
mind
clear
in
those
wide
spaces
and
my
lungs
filled
with
the
brisk
hill
air
but
i
noticed
one
curious
thing
on
my
last
visit
to
scotland
when
i
covered
more
moorland
miles
a
day
than
any
man
since
claverhouse
i
had
been
fascinated
by
the
land
and
had
pleased
myself
with
plans
for
settling
down
in
it
but
now
after
three
years
of
war
and
general
rocketing
i
felt
less
drawn
to
that
kind
of
landscape
i
wanted
something
more
green
and
peaceful
and
habitable
and
it
was
to
the
cotswolds
that
my
memory
turned
with
longing
i
puzzled
over
this
till
i
realized
that
in
all
my
cotswold
pictures
a
figure
kept
going
and
coming
a
young
girl
with
a
cloud
of
gold
hair
and
the
strong
slim
grace
of
a
boy
who
had
sung
ripe
in
a
moonlit
garden
up
on
that
hillside
i
understood
very
clearly
that
i
who
had
been
as
careless
of
women
as
any
monk
had
fallen
wildly
in
love
with
a
child
of
half
my
age
i
was
loath
to
admit
it
though
for
weeks
the
conclusion
had
been
forcing
itself
on
me
not
that
i
revel
in
my
madness
but
that
it
seemed
too
hopeless
a
business
and
i
had
no
use
for
barren
philandering
but
seated
on
a
rock
munching
chocolate
and
biscuits
i
faced
up
to
the
fact
and
resolved
to
trust
my
luck
after
all
we
were
comrades
in
a
big
job
and
it
was
up
to
me
to
be
man
enough
to
win
her
the
thought
seemed
to
brace
any
courage
that
was
in
me
no
task
seemed
too
hard
with
her
approval
to
gain
and
her
companionship
somewhere
at
the
back
of
it
i
sat
for
a
long
time
in
a
happy
dream
remembering
all
the
glimpses
i
had
had
of
her
and
humming
her
song
to
an
audience
of
one
sheep
on
the
highroad
half
a
mile
below
me
i
saw
a
figure
on
a
bicycle
mounting
the
hill
and
then
getting
off
to
mop
its
face
at
the
summit
i
turned
my
ziess
glasses
on
to
it
and
observed
that
it
was
a
country
policeman
it
caught
sight
of
me
stared
for
a
bit
tucked
its
machine
into
the
side
of
the
road
and
then
very
slowly
began
to
climb
the
hillside
once
it
stopped
waved
its
hand
and
shouted
something
which
i
could
not
hear
i
sat
finishing
my
luncheon
till
the
features
were
revealed
to
me
of
a
fat
oldish
man
blowing
like
a
grampus
his
cap
well
on
the
back
of
a
bald
head
and
his
trousers
tied
about
the
shins
with
string
there
was
a
spring
beside
me
and
i
had
out
my
flask
to
round
off
my
meal
a
drink
i
said
his
eye
brightened
and
a
smile
overran
his
moist
face
you
sir
it
will
be
very
warrm
coming
up
the
brae
ought
to
i
said
really
ought
you
know
scorching
up
hills
and
then
doubling
up
a
mountain
are
not
good
for
your
time
of
life
he
raised
the
cap
of
my
flask
in
solemn
salutation
very
good
health
then
he
smacked
his
lips
and
had
several
cupfuls
of
water
from
the
spring
will
haf
come
from
achranich
way
maybe
he
said
in
his
soft
having
at
last
found
his
breath
so
fine
weather
for
the
birds
if
there
was
anybody
to
shoot
them
no
there
will
be
few
shots
fired
today
for
there
are
no
gentlemen
left
in
morvern
but
i
wass
asking
you
if
you
come
from
achranich
if
you
haf
seen
anybody
on
the
road
from
his
pocket
he
extricated
a
brown
envelope
and
a
bulky
telegraph
form
you
read
it
sir
for
i
haf
forgot
my
spectacles
it
contained
a
description
of
one
brand
a
south
african
and
a
suspected
character
whom
the
police
were
warned
to
stop
and
return
to
oban
the
description
was
bad
but
it
lacked
any
one
good
distinctive
detail
clearly
the
policeman
took
me
for
an
innocent
pedestrian
probably
the
guest
of
some
moorland
with
my
brown
face
and
rough
tweeds
and
hobnailed
shoes
i
frowned
and
puzzled
a
little
did
see
a
fellow
about
three
miles
back
on
the
hillside
there
a
just
where
the
burn
comes
in
and
i
think
he
was
making
for
it
maybe
that
was
your
man
this
wire
says
south
african
and
now
i
remember
the
fellow
had
the
look
of
a
colonial
the
policeman
sighed
doubt
it
will
be
the
man
perhaps
he
will
haf
a
pistol
and
will
shoot
him
i
laughed
looked
a
mangy
sort
of
chap
and
he
be
scared
out
of
his
senses
at
the
sight
of
you
but
take
my
advice
and
get
somebody
with
you
before
you
tackle
him
you
always
the
better
of
a
witness
is
so
he
said
brightening
these
are
the
bad
times
in
old
days
there
wass
nothing
to
do
but
watch
the
doors
at
the
and
keep
the
yachts
from
poaching
the
but
now
it
is
spies
spies
and
donald
get
out
of
your
bed
and
go
off
twenty
mile
to
find
a
german
i
wass
wishing
the
war
wass
by
and
the
germans
all
dead
hear
i
cried
and
on
the
strength
of
it
gave
him
another
dram
i
accompanied
him
to
the
road
and
saw
him
mount
his
bicycle
and
like
a
snipe
down
the
hill
towards
achranich
then
i
set
off
briskly
northward
it
was
clear
that
the
faster
i
moved
the
better
as
i
went
i
paid
disgusted
tribute
to
the
efficiency
of
the
scottish
police
i
wondered
how
on
earth
they
had
marked
me
down
perhaps
it
was
the
glasgow
meeting
or
perhaps
my
association
with
ivery
at
biggleswick
anyhow
there
was
somebody
somewhere
mighty
quick
at
compiling
a
unless
i
wanted
to
be
bundled
back
to
oban
i
must
make
good
speed
to
the
arisaig
coast
presently
the
road
fell
to
a
gleaming
which
lay
like
the
blue
blade
of
a
sword
among
the
purple
of
the
hills
at
the
head
there
was
a
tiny
clachan
nestled
among
birches
and
rowans
where
a
tawny
burn
wound
to
the
sea
when
i
entered
the
place
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
and
peace
lay
on
it
like
a
garment
in
the
wide
sunny
street
there
was
no
sign
of
life
and
no
sound
except
of
hens
clucking
and
of
bees
busy
among
the
roses
there
was
a
little
grey
box
of
a
kirk
and
close
to
the
bridge
a
thatched
cottage
which
bore
the
sign
of
a
post
and
telegraph
office
for
the
past
hour
i
had
been
considering
that
i
had
better
prepare
for
mishaps
if
the
police
of
these
parts
had
been
warned
they
might
prove
too
much
for
me
and
gresson
would
be
allowed
to
make
his
journey
unmatched
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
send
a
wire
to
amos
and
leave
the
matter
in
his
hands
whether
that
was
possible
or
not
depended
upon
this
remote
postal
authority
i
entered
the
little
shop
and
passed
from
bright
sunshine
to
a
twilight
smelling
of
paraffin
and
peppermint
balls
an
old
woman
with
a
mutch
sat
in
an
behind
the
counter
she
looked
up
at
me
over
her
spectacles
and
smiled
and
i
took
to
her
on
the
instant
she
had
the
kind
of
old
wise
face
that
god
loves
beside
her
i
noticed
a
little
pile
of
books
one
of
which
was
a
bible
open
on
her
lap
was
a
paper
the
free
church
i
noticed
these
details
greedily
for
i
had
to
make
up
my
mind
on
the
part
to
play
a
warm
day
mistress
i
said
my
voice
falling
into
the
broad
lowland
speech
for
i
had
an
instinct
that
she
was
not
of
the
highlands
she
laid
aside
her
paper
is
that
sir
it
is
grand
weather
for
the
hairst
but
here
that
no
till
the
hinner
end
o
september
and
at
the
best
it
a
bit
scart
o
aits
it
a
different
thing
down
annandale
way
i
said
her
face
lit
up
ye

dumfries

just
from
dumfries
but
i
know
the
borders

sanderson
that
was
ma
man

me
here

i
think
o
the
bit
whaur
i
was
born
it
was
twae
miles
from
wamphray
on
the
lockerbie
road
but
they
tell
me
the
place

noo
just
a
rickle
o
stanes
was
wondering
mistress
if
i
could
get
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
village
hae
a
cup
wi
me
she
said
no
often
we
see
onybody
frae
the
borders
hereaways
the
kettle
just
on
the
boil
she
gave
me
tea
and
scones
and
butter
and
jam
and
treacle
biscuits
that
melted
in
the
mouth
and
as
we
ate
we
talked
of
many
things
chiefly
of
the
war
and
of
the
wickedness
of
the
world
nae
lads
left
here
she
said
a
joined
the
camerons
and
the
feck
o
them
fell
at
an
awfu
place
called
lowse
john
and
me
never

no
boys
jist
the
one
lassie
that
married
on
donald
frew
the
strontian
carrier
i
used
to
vex
mysel
about
it
but
now
i
thank
the
lord
that
in
his
mercy
he
spared
me
sorrow
but
i
wad
hae
liked
to
have
had
one
laddie
fechtin
for
his
country
i
whiles
wish
i
was
a
catholic
and
could
pit
up
prayers
for
the
sodgers
that

deid
it
maun
be
a
great
consolation
i
whipped
out
the
from
my
pocket
is
the
grand
book
for
a
time
like
this
i
ken
it
she
said
got
it
for
a
prize
in
the
sabbath
school
when
i
was
a
lassie
i
turned
the
pages
i
read
out
a
passage
or
two
and
then
i
seemed
struck
with
a
sudden
memory
is
a
telegraph
office
mistress
could
i
trouble
you
to
send
a
telegram
you
see
i
a
cousin
that
a
minister
in
at
the
kyle
and
him
and
me
are
great
correspondents
he
was
writing
about
something
in
the
and
i
think
i
send
him
a
telegram
in
answer
letter
would
be
cheaper
she
said
but
i
on
holiday
and
i
no
time
for
writing
she
gave
me
a
form
and
i
wrote
post
office
demas
will
be
at
his
mine
within
the
week
strive
with
him
lest
i
faint
by
the
unco
lavish
wi
the
words
sir
was
her
only
comment
we
parted
with
regret
and
there
was
nearly
a
row
when
i
tried
to
pay
for
the
tea
i
was
bidden
remember
her
to
one
david
tudhole
farmer
in
nether
mirecleuch
the
next
time
i
passed
by
wamphray
the
village
was
as
quiet
when
i
left
it
as
when
i
had
entered
i
took
my
way
up
the
hill
with
an
easier
mind
for
i
had
got
off
the
telegram
and
i
hoped
i
had
covered
my
tracks
my
friend
the
postmistress
would
if
questioned
be
unlikely
to
recognize
any
south
african
suspect
in
the
frank
and
homely
traveller
who
had
spoken
with
her
of
annandale
and
the
the
soft
mulberry
gloaming
of
the
west
coast
was
beginning
to
fall
on
the
hills
i
hoped
to
put
in
a
dozen
miles
before
dark
to
the
next
village
on
the
map
where
i
might
find
quarters
but
ere
i
had
gone
far
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
motor
behind
me
and
a
car
slipped
past
bearing
three
men
the
driver
favoured
me
with
a
sharp
glance
and
clapped
on
the
brakes
i
noted
that
the
two
men
in
the
tonneau
were
carrying
sporting
rifles
you
sir
he
cried
here
the
two
solemn
gillies
brought
their
weapons
to
attention
god
he
said
the
man
what
your
name
keep
him
covered
angus
the
gillies
duly
covered
me
and
i
did
not
like
the
look
of
their
wavering
barrels
they
were
obviously
as
surprised
as
myself
i
had
about
half
a
second
to
make
my
plans
i
advanced
with
a
very
stiff
air
and
asked
him
what
the
devil
he
meant
no
lowland
scots
for
me
now
my
tone
was
that
of
an
adjutant
of
a
guards
battalion
my
inquisitor
was
a
tall
man
in
an
ulster
with
a
green
felt
hat
on
his
small
head
he
had
a
lean
face
and
very
choleric
blue
eyes
i
set
him
down
as
a
soldier
retired
highland
regiment
or
cavalry
old
style
he
produced
a
telegraph
form
like
the
policeman
height
strongly
built
grey
tweeds
brown
hat
speaks
with
a
colonial
accent
much
sunburnt
what
your
name
sir
i
did
not
reply
in
a
colonial
accent
but
with
the
hauteur
of
the
british
officer
when
stopped
by
a
french
sentry
i
asked
him
again
what
the
devil
he
had
to
do
with
my
business
this
made
him
angry
and
he
began
to
stammer
teach
you
what
i
have
to
do
with
it
i
a
of
this
county
and
i
have
admiralty
instructions
to
watch
the
coast
damn
it
sir
i
a
wire
here
from
the
chief
constable
describing
you
you
brand
a
very
dangerous
fellow
and
we
want
to
know
what
the
devil
you
doing
here
as
i
looked
at
his
wrathful
eye
and
lean
head
which
could
not
have
held
much
brains
i
saw
that
i
must
change
my
tone
if
i
irritated
him
he
would
get
nasty
and
refuse
to
listen
and
hang
me
up
for
hours
so
my
voice
became
respectful
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
i
not
been
accustomed
to
be
pulled
up
suddenly
and
asked
for
my
credentials
my
name
is
blaikie
captain
robert
blaikie
of
the
scots
fusiliers
i
home
on
three
weeks
leave
to
get
a
little
peace
after
hooge
we
were
only
hauled
out
five
days
ago
i
hoped
my
old
friend
in
the
hospital
at
isham
would
pardon
my
borrowing
his
identity
the
man
looked
puzzled
the
devil
am
i
to
be
satisfied
about
that
have
you
any
papers
to
prove
it
no
i
do
carry
passports
about
with
me
on
a
walking
tour
but
you
can
wire
to
the
depot
or
to
my
london
address
he
pulled
at
his
yellow
moustache
hanged
if
i
know
what
to
do
i
want
to
get
home
for
dinner
i
tell
you
what
sir
i
take
you
on
with
me
and
put
you
up
for
the
night
my
boy
at
home
convalescing
and
if
he
says
you
pukka
i
ask
your
pardon
and
give
you
a
dashed
good
bottle
of
port
i
trust
him
and
i
warn
you
he
a
keen
hand
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
consent
and
i
got
in
beside
him
with
an
uneasy
conscience
supposing
the
son
knew
the
real
blaikie
i
asked
the
name
of
the
boy
battalion
and
was
told
the
seaforths
that
was
pleasant
hearing
for
they
had
been
brigaded
with
us
on
the
somme
but
colonel
broadbury
for
he
told
me
his
name
volunteered
another
piece
of
news
which
set
my
mind
at
rest
the
boy
was
not
yet
twenty
and
had
only
been
out
seven
months
at
arras
he
had
got
a
bit
of
shrapnel
in
his
thigh
which
had
played
the
deuce
with
the
sciatic
nerve
and
he
was
still
on
crutches
we
spun
over
ridges
of
moorland
always
keeping
northward
and
brought
up
at
a
pleasant
house
close
to
the
sea
colonel
broadbury
ushered
me
into
a
hall
where
a
small
fire
of
peats
was
burning
and
on
a
couch
beside
it
lay
a
slim
young
man
he
had
dropped
his
policeman
manner
and
behaved
like
a
gentleman
he
said
brought
a
friend
home
for
the
night
i
went
out
to
look
for
a
suspect
and
found
a
british
officer
this
is
captain
blaikie
of
the
scots
fusiliers
the
boy
looked
at
me
pleasantly
very
glad
to
meet
you
sir
you
excuse
me
not
getting
up
but
i
got
a
game
leg
he
was
the
copy
of
his
father
in
features
but
dark
and
sallow
where
the
other
was
blond
he
had
just
the
same
narrow
head
and
stubborn
mouth
and
honest
eyes
it
is
the
type
that
makes
dashing
regimental
officers
and
earns
and
gets
done
in
wholesale
i
was
never
that
kind
i
belonged
to
the
school
of
the
cunning
cowards
in
the
before
dinner
the
last
wisp
of
suspicion
fled
from
my
host
mind
for
ted
broadbury
and
i
were
immediately
deep
in
i
had
met
most
of
his
senior
officers
and
i
knew
all
about
their
doings
at
arras
for
his
brigade
had
been
across
the
river
on
my
left
we
fought
the
great
fight
over
again
and
yarned
about
technicalities
and
slanged
the
staff
in
the
way
young
officers
have
the
father
throwing
in
questions
that
showed
how
mighty
proud
he
was
of
his
son
i
had
a
bath
before
dinner
and
as
he
led
me
to
the
bathroom
he
apologized
very
handsomely
for
his
bad
manners
coming
been
a
godsend
for
ted
he
was
moping
a
bit
in
this
place
and
though
i
say
it
that
should
he
a
dashed
good
boy
i
had
my
promised
bottle
of
port
and
after
dinner
i
took
on
the
father
at
billiards
then
we
settled
in
the
and
i
laid
myself
out
to
entertain
the
pair
the
result
was
that
they
would
have
me
stay
a
week
but
i
spoke
of
the
shortness
of
my
leave
and
said
i
must
get
on
to
the
railway
and
then
back
to
fort
william
for
my
luggage
so
i
spent
that
night
between
clean
sheets
and
ate
a
christian
breakfast
and
was
given
my
host
car
to
set
me
a
bit
on
the
road
i
dismissed
it
after
half
a
dozen
miles
and
following
the
map
struck
over
the
hills
to
the
west
about
midday
i
topped
a
ridge
and
beheld
the
sound
of
sleat
shining
beneath
me
there
were
other
things
in
the
landscape
in
the
valley
on
the
right
a
long
goods
train
was
crawling
on
the
mallaig
railway
and
across
the
strip
of
sea
like
some
fortress
of
the
old
gods
rose
the
dark
bastions
and
turrets
of
the
hills
of
skye
chapter
six
the
skirts
of
the
coolin
obviously
i
must
keep
away
from
the
railway
if
the
police
were
after
me
in
morvern
that
line
would
be
warned
for
it
was
a
barrier
i
must
cross
if
i
were
to
go
farther
north
i
observed
from
the
map
that
it
turned
up
the
coast
and
concluded
that
the
place
for
me
to
make
for
was
the
shore
south
of
that
turn
where
heaven
might
send
me
some
luck
in
the
boat
line
for
i
was
pretty
certain
that
every
porter
and
on
that
outfit
was
anxious
to
make
better
acquaintance
with
my
humble
self
i
lunched
off
the
sandwiches
the
broadburys
had
given
me
and
in
the
bright
afternoon
made
my
way
down
the
hill
crossed
at
the
foot
of
a
small
lochan
and
pursued
the
issuing
stream
through
woods
of
hazels
to
its
junction
with
the
sea
it
was
rough
going
but
very
pleasant
and
i
fell
into
the
same
mood
of
idle
contentment
that
i
had
enjoyed
the
previous
morning
i
never
met
a
soul
sometimes
a
roe
deer
broke
out
of
the
covert
or
an
old
blackcock
startled
me
with
his
scolding
the
place
was
bright
with
heather
still
in
its
first
bloom
and
smelt
better
than
the
myrrh
of
arabia
it
was
a
blessed
glen
and
i
was
as
happy
as
a
king
till
i
began
to
feel
the
coming
of
hunger
and
reflected
that
the
lord
alone
knew
when
i
might
get
a
meal
i
had
still
some
chocolate
and
biscuits
but
i
wanted
something
substantial
the
distance
was
greater
than
i
thought
and
it
was
already
twilight
when
i
reached
the
coast
the
shore
was
open
and
desolate
great
banks
of
pebbles
to
which
straggled
alders
and
hazels
from
the
hillside
scrub
but
as
i
marched
northward
and
turned
a
little
point
of
land
i
saw
before
me
in
a
crook
of
the
bay
a
smoking
cottage
and
plodding
along
by
the
water
edge
was
the
bent
figure
of
a
man
laden
with
nets
and
lobster
pots
also
beached
on
the
shingle
was
a
boat
i
quickened
my
pace
and
overtook
the
fisherman
he
was
an
old
man
with
a
ragged
grey
beard
and
his
rig
was
seaman
boots
and
a
blue
jersey
he
was
deaf
and
did
not
hear
me
when
i
hailed
him
when
he
caught
sight
of
me
he
never
stopped
though
he
very
solemnly
returned
my
good
evening
i
fell
into
step
with
him
and
in
his
silent
company
reached
the
cottage
he
halted
before
the
door
and
unslung
his
burdens
the
place
was
a
building
with
a
roof
of
thatch
and
the
walls
all
grown
over
with
a
creeper
when
he
had
straightened
his
back
he
looked
seaward
and
at
the
sky
as
if
to
prospect
the
weather
then
he
turned
on
me
his
gentle
absorbed
eyes
will
haf
been
a
fine
day
sir
wass
you
seeking
the
road
to
anywhere
was
seeking
a
night
lodging
i
said
had
a
long
tramp
on
the
hills
and
i
be
glad
of
a
chance
of
not
going
farther
will
haf
no
accommodation
for
a
gentleman
he
said
gravely
can
sleep
on
the
floor
if
you
can
give
me
a
blanket
and
a
bite
of
supper
you
will
not
and
he
smiled
slowly
i
will
ask
the
wife
mary
come
here
an
old
woman
appeared
in
answer
to
his
call
a
woman
whose
face
was
so
old
that
she
seemed
like
his
mother
in
highland
places
one
sex
ages
quicker
than
the
other
gentleman
would
like
to
bide
the
night
i
wass
telling
him
that
we
had
a
poor
small
house
but
he
says
he
will
not
be
minding
it
she
looked
at
me
with
the
timid
politeness
that
you
find
only
in
outland
places
can
do
our
best
indeed
sir
the
gentleman
can
have
colin
bed
in
the
loft
but
he
will
haf
to
be
doing
with
plain
food
supper
is
ready
if
you
will
come
in
now
i
had
a
scrub
with
a
piece
of
yellow
soap
at
an
adjacent
pool
in
the
burn
and
then
entered
a
kitchen
blue
with
we
had
a
meal
of
boiled
fish
oatcakes
and
cheese
with
cups
of
strong
tea
to
wash
it
down
the
old
folk
had
the
manners
of
princes
they
pressed
food
on
me
and
asked
me
no
questions
till
for
very
decency
sake
i
had
to
put
up
a
story
and
give
some
account
of
myself
i
found
they
had
a
son
in
the
argylls
and
a
young
boy
in
the
navy
but
they
seemed
disinclined
to
talk
of
them
or
of
the
war
by
a
mere
accident
i
hit
on
the
old
man
absorbing
interest
he
was
passionate
about
the
land
he
had
taken
part
in
agitations
and
had
suffered
eviction
in
some
ancient
landlords
quarrel
farther
north
presently
he
was
pouring
out
to
me
all
the
woes
of
the
crofter
woes
that
seemed
so
antediluvian
and
forgotten
that
i
listened
as
one
would
listen
to
an
old
song
who
come
from
a
new
country
will
not
haf
heard
of
these
things
he
kept
telling
me
but
by
that
peat
fire
i
made
up
for
my
defective
education
he
told
me
of
evictions
in
the
year
one
somewhere
in
sutherland
and
of
harsh
doings
in
the
outer
isles
it
was
far
more
than
a
political
grievance
it
was
the
lament
of
the
conservative
for
vanished
days
and
manners
in
skye
wass
the
fine
land
for
black
cattle
and
every
man
had
his
bit
herd
on
the
hillside
but
the
lairds
said
it
wass
better
for
sheep
and
then
they
said
it
wass
not
good
for
sheep
so
they
put
it
under
deer
and
now
there
is
no
black
cattle
anywhere
in
skye
i
tell
you
it
was
like
sad
music
on
the
bagpipes
hearing
that
old
fellow
the
war
and
all
things
modern
meant
nothing
to
him
he
lived
among
the
tragedies
of
his
youth
and
his
prime
i
a
tory
myself
and
a
bit
of
a
so
we
agreed
well
enough
so
well
that
i
got
what
i
wanted
without
asking
for
it
i
told
him
i
was
going
to
skye
and
he
offered
to
take
me
over
in
his
boat
in
the
morning
will
be
no
trouble
indeed
no
i
will
be
going
that
way
myself
to
the
fishing
i
told
him
that
after
the
war
every
acre
of
british
soil
would
have
to
be
used
for
the
men
that
had
earned
the
right
to
it
but
that
did
not
comfort
him
he
was
not
thinking
about
the
land
itself
but
about
the
men
who
had
been
driven
from
it
fifty
years
before
his
desire
was
not
for
reform
but
for
restitution
and
that
was
past
the
power
of
any
government
i
went
to
bed
in
the
loft
in
a
sad
reflective
mood
considering
how
in
speeding
our
newfangled
plough
we
must
break
down
a
multitude
of
molehills
and
how
desirable
and
unreplaceable
was
the
life
of
the
moles
in
brisk
shining
weather
with
a
wind
from
the
we
put
off
next
morning
in
front
was
a
brown
line
of
low
hills
and
behind
them
a
little
to
the
north
that
black
toothcomb
of
mountain
range
which
i
had
seen
the
day
before
from
the
arisaig
ridge
is
the
coolin
said
the
fisherman
is
a
bad
place
where
even
the
deer
can
not
go
but
all
the
rest
of
skye
wass
the
fine
land
for
black
cattle
as
we
neared
the
coast
he
pointed
out
many
places
there
sir
in
that
glen
i
haf
seen
six
cot
houses
smoking
there
and
now
there
is
not
any
left
there
were
three
men
of
my
own
name
had
crofts
on
the
machars
beyond
the
point
and
if
you
go
there
you
will
only
find
the
marks
of
their
bit
gardens
you
will
know
the
place
by
the
gean
trees
when
he
put
me
ashore
in
a
sandy
bay
between
green
ridges
of
bracken
he
was
still
harping
upon
the
past
i
got
him
to
take
a
pound
for
the
boat
and
not
for
the
night
hospitality
for
he
would
have
beaten
me
with
an
oar
if
i
had
suggested
that
the
last
i
saw
of
him
as
i
turned
round
at
the
top
of
the
hill
he
had
still
his
sail
down
and
was
gazing
at
the
lands
which
had
once
been
full
of
human
dwellings
and
now
were
desolate
i
kept
for
a
while
along
the
ridge
with
the
sound
of
sleat
on
my
right
and
beyond
it
the
high
hills
of
knoydart
and
kintail
i
was
watching
for
the
but
saw
no
sign
of
her
a
steamer
put
out
from
mallaig
and
there
were
several
drifters
crawling
up
the
channel
and
once
i
saw
the
white
ensign
and
a
destroyer
bustled
northward
leaving
a
cloud
of
black
smoke
in
her
wake
then
after
consulting
the
map
i
struck
across
country
still
keeping
the
higher
ground
but
except
at
odd
minutes
being
out
of
sight
of
the
sea
i
concluded
that
my
business
was
to
get
to
the
latitude
of
ranna
without
wasting
time
so
soon
as
i
changed
my
course
i
had
the
coolin
for
company
mountains
have
always
been
a
craze
of
mine
and
the
blackness
and
mystery
of
those
grim
peaks
went
to
my
head
i
forgot
all
about
fosse
manor
and
the
cotswolds
i
forgot
too
what
had
been
my
chief
feeling
since
i
left
glasgow
a
sense
of
the
absurdity
of
my
mission
it
had
all
seemed
too
and
whimsical
i
was
running
apparently
no
great
personal
risk
and
i
had
always
the
unpleasing
fear
that
blenkiron
might
have
been
too
clever
and
that
the
whole
thing
might
be
a
nest
but
that
dark
mountain
mass
changed
my
outlook
i
began
to
have
a
queer
instinct
that
that
was
the
place
that
something
might
be
concealed
there
something
pretty
damnable
i
remember
i
sat
on
a
top
for
half
an
hour
raking
the
hills
with
my
glasses
i
made
out
ugly
precipices
and
glens
which
lost
themselves
in
primeval
blackness
when
the
sun
caught
them
for
it
was
a
gleamy
day
it
brought
out
no
colours
only
degrees
of
shade
no
mountains
i
had
ever
seen
not
the
drakensberg
or
the
red
kopjes
of
damaraland
or
the
cold
white
peaks
around
erzerum
ever
looked
so
unearthly
and
uncanny
oddly
enough
too
the
sight
of
them
set
me
thinking
about
ivery
there
seemed
no
link
between
a
smooth
sedentary
being
dwelling
in
villas
and
and
that
shaggy
tangle
of
precipices
but
i
felt
there
was
for
i
had
begun
to
realize
the
bigness
of
my
opponent
blenkiron
had
said
that
he
spun
his
web
wide
that
was
intelligible
enough
among
the
youth
of
biggleswick
and
the
pacifist
societies
or
even
the
toughs
on
the
clyde
i
could
fit
him
in
all
right
to
that
picture
but
that
he
should
be
playing
his
game
among
those
mysterious
black
crags
seemed
to
make
him
bigger
and
more
desperate
altogether
a
different
kind
of
proposition
i
did
exactly
dislike
the
idea
for
my
objection
to
my
past
weeks
had
been
that
i
was
out
of
my
proper
job
and
this
was
more
my
line
of
country
i
always
felt
that
i
was
a
better
bandit
than
a
detective
but
a
sort
of
awe
mingled
with
my
satisfaction
i
began
to
feel
about
ivery
as
i
had
felt
about
the
three
devils
of
the
black
stone
who
had
hunted
me
before
the
war
and
as
i
never
felt
about
any
other
hun
the
men
we
fought
at
the
front
and
the
men
i
had
run
across
in
the
greenmantle
business
even
old
stumm
himself
had
been
human
miscreants
they
were
formidable
enough
but
you
could
gauge
and
calculate
their
capacities
but
this
ivery
was
like
a
poison
gas
that
hung
in
the
air
and
got
into
unexpected
crannies
and
that
you
could
fight
in
an
upstanding
way
till
then
in
spite
of
blenkiron
solemnity
i
had
regarded
him
simply
as
a
problem
but
now
he
seemed
an
intimate
and
omnipresent
enemy
intangible
too
as
the
horror
of
a
haunted
house
up
on
that
sunny
hillside
with
the
sea
winds
round
me
and
the
whaups
calling
i
got
a
chill
in
my
spine
when
i
thought
of
him
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
it
but
i
was
also
horribly
hungry
there
was
something
about
the
war
that
made
me
ravenous
and
the
less
chance
of
food
the
worse
i
felt
if
i
had
been
in
london
with
twenty
restaurants
open
to
me
i
should
as
likely
as
not
have
gone
off
my
feed
that
was
the
cussedness
of
my
stomach
i
had
still
a
little
chocolate
left
and
i
ate
the
fisherman
buttered
scones
for
luncheon
but
long
before
the
evening
my
thoughts
were
dwelling
on
my
empty
interior
i
put
up
that
night
in
a
shepherd
cottage
miles
from
anywhere
the
man
was
called
macmorran
and
he
had
come
from
galloway
when
sheep
were
booming
he
was
a
very
good
imitation
of
a
savage
a
little
fellow
with
red
hair
and
red
eyes
who
might
have
been
a
pict
he
lived
with
a
daughter
who
had
once
been
in
service
in
glasgow
a
fat
young
woman
with
a
face
entirely
covered
with
freckles
and
a
pout
of
habitual
discontent
no
wonder
for
that
cottage
was
a
pretty
mean
place
it
was
so
thick
with
that
throat
and
eyes
were
always
smarting
it
was
badly
built
and
must
have
leaked
like
a
sieve
in
a
storm
the
father
was
a
surly
fellow
whose
conversation
was
one
long
growl
at
the
world
the
high
prices
the
difficulty
of
moving
his
sheep
the
meanness
of
his
master
and
the
godforsaken
character
of
skye
me
no
seen
baker
bread
for
a
month
and
no
company
but
a
wheen
ignorant
hielanders
that
yatter
gawlic
i
wish
i
was
back
in
the
glenkens
and
i
gang
the
morn
if
i
could
get
paid
what
i
awed
however
he
gave
me
supper
a
braxy
ham
and
oatcake
and
i
bought
the
remnants
off
him
for
use
next
day
i
did
not
trust
his
blankets
so
i
slept
the
night
by
the
fire
in
the
ruins
of
an
and
woke
at
dawn
with
a
foul
taste
in
my
mouth
a
dip
in
the
burn
refreshed
me
and
after
a
bowl
of
porridge
i
took
the
road
again
for
i
was
anxious
to
get
to
some
that
looked
over
to
ranna
before
midday
i
was
close
under
the
eastern
side
of
the
coolin
on
a
road
which
was
more
a
rockery
than
a
path
presently
i
saw
a
big
house
ahead
of
me
that
looked
like
an
inn
so
i
gave
it
a
miss
and
struck
the
highway
that
led
to
it
a
little
farther
north
then
i
bore
off
to
the
east
and
was
just
beginning
to
climb
a
hill
which
i
judged
stood
between
me
and
the
sea
when
i
heard
wheels
on
the
road
and
looked
back
it
was
a
farmer
gig
carrying
one
man
i
was
about
half
a
mile
off
and
something
in
the
cut
of
his
jib
seemed
familiar
i
got
my
glasses
on
him
and
made
out
a
short
stout
figure
clad
in
a
mackintosh
with
a
woollen
comforter
round
its
throat
as
i
watched
it
made
a
movement
as
if
to
rub
its
nose
on
its
sleeve
that
was
the
pet
trick
of
one
man
i
knew
inconspicuously
i
slipped
through
the
long
heather
so
as
to
reach
the
road
ahead
of
the
gig
when
i
rose
like
a
wraith
from
the
wayside
the
horse
started
but
not
the
driver
ye
there
said
amos
voice
news
for
ye
the
will
be
in
ranna
by
now
she
passed
broadford
two
hours
syne
when
i
saw
her
i
yoked
this
beast
and
came
up
on
the
chance
of
foregathering
with
ye
on
earth
did
you
know
i
would
be
here
i
asked
in
some
surprise
i
saw
the
way
your
mind
was
workin
from
your
telegram
and
says
i
to
mysel
that
man
brand
says
i
is
not
the
chiel
to
be
easy
stoppit
but
i
was
feared
ye
might
be
a
day
late
so
i
came
up
the
road
to
hold
the
fort
man
i
glad
to
see
ye
ye
younger
and
soopler
than
me
and
yon
gresson
a
stirrin
lad
one
thing
you
got
to
do
for
me
i
said
ca
go
into
inns
and
shops
but
i
ca
do
without
food
i
see
from
the
map
a
town
about
six
miles
on
go
there
and
buy
me
anything
tinned
biscuits
and
tongue
and
sardines
and
a
couple
of
bottles
of
whisky
if
you
can
get
them
this
may
be
a
long
job
so
buy
plenty
i
put
them
was
his
only
question
we
fixed
on
a
cache
a
hundred
yards
from
the
highway
in
a
place
where
two
ridges
of
hill
enclosed
the
view
so
that
only
a
short
bit
of
road
was
visible
get
back
to
the
kyle
he
told
me
there
kens
andra
amos
if
ye
should
find
a
way
of
sendin
a
message
or
comin
yourself
oh
and
i
got
a
word
to
ye
from
a
lady
that
we
ken
of
she
says
the
sooner
ye
back
in
vawnity
fair
the
better
she
be
pleased
always
provided
ye
got
over
the
hill
difficulty
a
smile
screwed
up
his
old
face
and
he
waved
his
whip
in
farewell
i
interpreted
mary
message
as
an
incitement
to
speed
but
i
could
not
make
the
pace
that
was
gresson
business
i
think
i
was
a
little
nettled
till
i
cheered
myself
by
another
interpretation
she
might
be
anxious
for
my
safety
she
might
want
to
see
me
again
anyhow
the
mere
sending
of
the
message
showed
i
was
not
forgotten
i
was
in
a
pleasant
muse
as
i
breasted
the
hill
keeping
discreetly
in
the
cover
of
the
many
gullies
at
the
top
i
looked
down
on
ranna
and
the
sea
there
lay
the
busy
unloading
it
would
be
some
time
no
doubt
before
gresson
could
leave
there
was
no
in
the
channel
yet
and
i
might
have
to
wait
hours
i
settled
myself
snugly
between
two
rocks
where
i
could
not
be
seen
and
where
i
had
a
clear
view
of
the
sea
and
shore
but
presently
i
found
that
i
wanted
some
long
heather
to
make
a
couch
and
i
emerged
to
get
some
i
had
not
raised
my
head
for
a
second
when
i
flopped
down
again
for
i
had
a
neighbour
on
the
he
was
about
two
hundred
yards
off
just
reaching
the
crest
and
unlike
me
walking
quite
openly
his
eyes
were
on
ranna
so
he
did
not
notice
me
but
from
my
cover
i
scanned
every
line
of
him
he
looked
an
ordinary
countryman
wearing
badly
cut
baggy
knickerbockers
of
the
kind
that
gillies
affect
he
had
a
face
like
a
portuguese
jew
but
i
had
seen
that
type
before
among
people
with
highland
names
they
might
be
jews
or
not
but
they
could
speak
gaelic
presently
he
disappeared
he
had
followed
my
example
and
selected
a
it
was
a
clear
hot
day
but
very
pleasant
in
that
airy
place
good
scents
came
up
from
the
sea
the
heather
was
warm
and
fragrant
bees
droned
about
and
stray
seagulls
swept
the
ridge
with
their
wings
i
took
a
look
now
and
then
towards
my
neighbour
but
he
was
deep
in
his
most
of
the
time
i
kept
my
glasses
on
ranna
and
watched
the
doings
of
the
she
was
tied
up
at
the
jetty
but
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
unload
i
watched
the
captain
disembark
and
walk
up
to
a
house
on
the
hillside
then
some
idlers
sauntered
down
towards
her
and
stood
talking
and
smoking
close
to
her
side
the
captain
returned
and
left
again
a
man
with
papers
in
his
hand
appeared
and
a
woman
with
what
looked
like
a
telegram
the
mate
went
ashore
in
his
best
clothes
then
at
last
after
midday
gresson
appeared
he
joined
the
captain
at
the
piermaster
office
and
presently
emerged
on
the
other
side
of
the
jetty
where
some
small
boats
were
beached
a
man
from
the
came
in
answer
to
his
call
a
boat
was
launched
and
began
to
make
its
way
into
the
channel
gresson
sat
in
the
stern
placidly
eating
his
luncheon
i
watched
every
detail
of
that
crossing
with
some
satisfaction
that
my
forecast
was
turning
out
right
about
across
gresson
took
the
oars
but
soon
surrendered
them
to
the
man
and
lit
a
pipe
he
got
out
a
pair
of
binoculars
and
raked
my
hillside
i
tried
to
see
if
my
neighbour
was
making
any
signal
but
all
was
quiet
presently
the
boat
was
hid
from
me
by
the
bulge
of
the
hill
and
i
caught
the
sound
of
her
scraping
on
the
beach
gresson
was
not
a
like
my
neighbour
it
took
him
the
best
part
of
an
hour
to
get
to
the
top
and
he
reached
it
at
a
point
not
two
yards
from
my
i
could
hear
by
his
labouring
breath
that
he
was
very
blown
he
walked
straight
over
the
crest
till
he
was
out
of
sight
of
ranna
and
flung
himself
on
the
ground
he
was
now
about
fifty
yards
from
me
and
i
made
shift
to
lessen
the
distance
there
was
a
grassy
trench
skirting
the
north
side
of
the
hill
deep
and
thickly
overgrown
with
heather
i
wound
my
way
along
it
till
i
was
about
twelve
yards
from
him
where
i
stuck
owing
to
the
trench
dying
away
when
i
peered
out
of
the
cover
i
saw
that
the
other
man
had
joined
him
and
that
the
idiots
were
engaged
in
embracing
each
other
i
dared
not
move
an
inch
nearer
and
as
they
talked
in
a
low
voice
i
could
hear
nothing
of
what
they
said
nothing
except
one
phrase
which
the
strange
man
repeated
twice
very
emphatically
night
he
said
and
i
noticed
that
his
voice
had
not
the
highland
inflection
which
i
looked
for
gresson
nodded
and
glanced
at
his
watch
and
then
the
two
began
to
move
downhill
towards
the
road
i
had
travelled
that
morning
i
followed
as
best
i
could
using
a
shallow
dry
watercourse
of
which
sheep
had
made
a
track
and
which
kept
me
well
below
the
level
of
the
moor
it
took
me
down
the
hill
but
some
distance
from
the
line
the
pair
were
taking
and
i
had
to
reconnoitre
frequently
to
watch
their
movements
they
were
still
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
from
the
road
when
they
stopped
and
stared
and
i
stared
with
them
on
that
lonely
highway
travellers
were
about
as
rare
as
roadmenders
and
what
caught
their
eye
was
a
farmer
gig
driven
by
a
elderly
man
with
a
woollen
comforter
round
his
neck
i
had
a
bad
moment
for
i
reckoned
that
if
gresson
recognized
amos
he
might
take
fright
perhaps
the
driver
of
the
gig
thought
the
same
for
he
appeared
to
be
very
drunk
he
waved
his
whip
he
jiggoted
the
reins
and
he
made
an
effort
to
sing
he
looked
towards
the
figures
on
the
hillside
and
cried
out
something
the
gig
narrowly
missed
the
ditch
and
then
to
my
relief
the
horse
bolted
swaying
like
a
ship
in
a
gale
the
whole
outfit
lurched
out
of
sight
round
the
corner
of
hill
where
lay
my
cache
if
amos
could
stop
the
beast
and
deliver
the
goods
there
he
had
put
up
a
masterly
bit
of
buffoonery
the
two
men
laughed
at
the
performance
and
then
they
parted
gresson
retraced
his
steps
up
the
hill
the
other
man
i
called
him
in
my
mind
the
portuguese
jew
started
off
at
a
great
pace
due
west
across
the
road
and
over
a
big
patch
of
bog
towards
the
northern
butt
of
the
coolin
he
had
some
errand
which
gresson
knew
about
and
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
perform
it
it
was
clearly
my
job
to
get
after
him
i
had
a
rotten
afternoon
the
fellow
covered
the
moorland
miles
like
a
deer
and
under
the
hot
august
sun
i
toiled
on
his
trail
i
had
to
keep
well
behind
and
as
much
as
possible
in
cover
in
case
he
looked
back
and
that
meant
that
when
he
had
passed
over
a
ridge
i
had
to
double
not
to
let
him
get
too
far
ahead
and
when
we
were
in
an
open
place
i
had
to
make
wide
circuits
to
keep
hidden
we
struck
a
road
which
crossed
a
low
pass
and
skirted
the
flank
of
the
mountains
and
this
we
followed
till
we
were
on
the
western
side
and
within
sight
of
the
sea
it
was
gorgeous
weather
and
out
on
the
blue
water
i
saw
cool
sails
moving
and
little
breezes
ruffling
the
calm
while
i
was
glowing
like
a
furnace
happily
i
was
in
fair
training
and
i
needed
it
the
portuguese
jew
must
have
done
a
steady
six
miles
an
hour
over
abominable
country
about
five
we
came
to
a
point
where
i
dared
not
follow
the
road
ran
flat
by
the
edge
of
the
sea
so
that
several
miles
of
it
were
visible
moreover
the
man
had
begun
to
look
round
every
few
minutes
he
was
getting
near
something
and
wanted
to
be
sure
that
no
one
was
in
his
neighbourhood
i
left
the
road
accordingly
and
took
to
the
hillside
which
to
my
undoing
was
one
long
cascade
of
screes
and
tumbled
rocks
i
saw
him
drop
over
a
rise
which
seemed
to
mark
the
rim
of
a
little
bay
into
which
descended
one
of
the
big
corries
of
the
mountains
it
must
have
been
a
good
later
before
i
at
my
greater
altitude
and
with
far
worse
going
reached
the
same
rim
i
looked
into
the
glen
and
my
man
had
disappeared
he
could
not
have
crossed
it
for
the
place
was
wider
than
i
had
thought
a
ring
of
black
precipices
came
down
to
within
half
a
mile
of
the
shore
and
between
them
was
a
big
stream
long
shallow
pools
at
the
sea
end
and
a
chain
of
waterfalls
above
he
had
gone
to
earth
like
a
badger
somewhere
and
i
dared
not
move
in
case
he
might
be
watching
me
from
behind
a
boulder
but
even
as
i
hesitated
he
appeared
again
fording
the
stream
his
face
set
on
the
road
we
had
come
whatever
his
errand
was
he
had
finished
it
and
was
posting
back
to
his
master
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
should
follow
him
but
another
instinct
prevailed
he
had
not
come
to
this
wild
place
for
the
scenery
somewhere
down
in
the
glen
there
was
something
or
somebody
that
held
the
key
of
the
mystery
it
was
my
business
to
stay
there
till
i
had
unlocked
it
besides
in
two
hours
it
would
be
dark
and
i
had
had
enough
walking
for
one
day
i
made
my
way
to
the
stream
side
and
had
a
long
drink
the
corrie
behind
me
was
lit
up
with
the
westering
sun
and
the
bald
cliffs
were
flushed
with
pink
and
gold
on
each
side
of
the
stream
was
turf
like
a
lawn
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
wide
and
then
a
tangle
of
long
heather
and
boulders
right
up
to
the
edge
of
the
great
rocks
i
had
never
seen
a
more
delectable
evening
but
i
could
not
enjoy
its
peace
because
of
my
anxiety
about
the
portuguese
jew
he
had
not
been
there
more
than
half
an
hour
just
about
long
enough
for
a
man
to
travel
to
the
first
ridge
across
the
burn
and
back
yet
he
had
found
time
to
do
his
business
he
might
have
left
a
letter
in
some
prearranged
place
in
which
case
i
would
stay
there
till
the
man
it
was
meant
for
turned
up
or
he
might
have
met
someone
though
i
did
think
that
possible
as
i
scanned
the
acres
of
rough
moor
and
then
looked
at
the
sea
lapping
delicately
on
the
grey
sand
i
had
the
feeling
that
a
knotty
problem
was
before
me
it
was
too
dark
to
try
to
track
his
steps
that
must
be
left
for
the
morning
and
i
prayed
that
there
would
be
no
rain
in
the
night
i
ate
for
supper
most
of
the
braxy
ham
and
oatcake
i
had
brought
from
macmorran
cottage
it
took
some
for
i
was
ferociously
hungry
to
save
a
little
for
breakfast
next
morning
then
i
pulled
heather
and
bracken
and
made
myself
a
bed
in
the
shelter
of
a
rock
which
stood
on
a
knoll
above
the
stream
my
was
well
hidden
but
at
the
same
time
if
anything
should
appear
in
the
early
dawn
it
gave
me
a
prospect
with
my
waterproof
i
was
perfectly
warm
and
after
smoking
two
pipes
i
fell
asleep
my
night
rest
was
broken
first
it
was
a
fox
which
came
and
barked
at
my
ear
and
woke
me
to
a
night
with
scarcely
a
star
showing
the
next
time
it
was
nothing
but
a
wandering
but
as
i
sat
up
and
listened
i
thought
i
saw
a
spark
of
light
near
the
edge
of
the
sea
it
was
only
for
a
second
but
it
disquieted
me
i
got
out
and
climbed
on
the
top
of
the
rock
but
all
was
still
save
for
the
gentle
lap
of
the
tide
and
the
croak
of
some
night
bird
among
the
crags
the
third
time
i
was
suddenly
quite
wide
awake
and
without
any
reason
for
i
had
not
been
dreaming
now
i
have
slept
hundreds
of
times
alone
beside
my
horse
on
the
veld
and
i
never
knew
any
cause
for
such
awakenings
but
the
one
and
that
was
the
presence
near
me
of
some
human
being
a
man
who
is
accustomed
to
solitude
gets
this
extra
sense
which
announces
like
an
the
approach
of
one
of
his
kind
but
i
could
hear
nothing
there
was
a
scraping
and
rustling
on
the
moor
but
that
was
only
the
wind
and
the
little
wild
things
of
the
hills
a
fox
perhaps
or
a
blue
hare
i
convinced
my
reason
but
not
my
senses
and
for
long
i
lay
awake
with
my
ears
at
full
cock
and
every
nerve
tense
then
i
fell
asleep
and
woke
to
the
first
flush
of
dawn
the
sun
was
behind
the
coolin
and
the
hills
were
black
as
ink
but
far
out
in
the
western
seas
was
a
broad
band
of
gold
i
got
up
and
went
down
to
the
shore
the
mouth
of
the
stream
was
shallow
but
as
i
moved
south
i
came
to
a
place
where
two
small
capes
enclosed
an
inlet
it
must
have
been
a
fault
in
the
volcanic
rock
for
its
depth
was
portentous
i
stripped
and
dived
far
into
its
cold
abysses
but
i
did
not
reach
the
bottom
i
came
to
the
surface
rather
breathless
and
struck
out
to
sea
where
i
floated
on
my
back
and
looked
at
the
great
rampart
of
crag
i
saw
that
the
place
where
i
had
spent
the
night
was
only
a
little
oasis
of
green
at
the
base
of
one
of
the
grimmest
corries
the
imagination
could
picture
it
was
as
desert
as
damaraland
i
noticed
too
how
sharply
the
cliffs
rose
from
the
level
there
were
chimneys
and
gullies
by
which
a
man
might
have
made
his
way
to
the
summit
but
no
one
of
them
could
have
been
scaled
except
by
a
mountaineer
i
was
feeling
better
now
with
all
the
frowsiness
washed
out
of
me
and
i
dried
myself
by
racing
up
and
down
the
heather
then
i
noticed
something
there
were
marks
of
human
feet
at
the
top
of
the
inlet
not
mine
for
they
were
on
the
other
side
the
short
was
bruised
and
trampled
in
several
places
and
there
were
broken
stems
of
bracken
i
thought
that
some
fisherman
had
probably
landed
there
to
stretch
his
legs
but
that
set
me
thinking
of
the
portuguese
jew
after
breakfasting
on
my
last
morsels
of
food
a
knuckle
of
braxy
and
a
bit
of
oatcake
i
set
about
tracking
him
from
the
place
where
he
had
first
entered
the
glen
to
get
my
bearings
i
went
back
over
the
road
i
had
come
myself
and
after
a
good
deal
of
trouble
i
found
his
spoor
it
was
pretty
clear
as
far
as
the
stream
for
he
had
been
walking
or
rather
running
over
ground
with
many
patches
of
gravel
on
it
after
that
it
was
difficult
and
i
lost
it
entirely
in
the
rough
heather
below
the
crags
all
that
i
could
make
out
for
certain
was
that
he
had
crossed
the
stream
and
that
his
business
whatever
it
was
had
been
with
the
few
acres
of
tumbled
wilderness
below
the
precipices
i
spent
a
busy
morning
there
but
found
nothing
except
the
skeleton
of
a
sheep
picked
clean
by
the
ravens
it
was
a
thankless
job
and
i
got
very
cross
over
it
i
had
an
ugly
feeling
that
i
was
on
a
false
scent
and
wasting
my
time
i
wished
to
heaven
i
had
old
peter
with
me
he
could
follow
spoor
like
a
bushman
and
would
have
riddled
the
portuguese
jew
track
out
of
any
jungle
on
earth
that
was
a
game
i
had
never
learned
for
in
the
old
days
i
had
always
left
it
to
my
natives
i
chucked
the
attempt
and
lay
disconsolately
on
a
warm
patch
of
grass
and
smoked
and
thought
about
peter
but
my
chief
reflections
were
that
i
had
breakfasted
at
five
that
it
was
now
eleven
that
i
was
intolerably
hungry
that
there
was
nothing
here
to
feed
a
grasshopper
and
that
i
should
starve
unless
i
got
supplies
it
was
a
long
road
to
my
cache
but
there
were
no
two
ways
of
it
my
only
hope
was
to
sit
tight
in
the
glen
and
it
might
involve
a
wait
of
days
to
wait
i
must
have
food
and
though
it
meant
relinquishing
guard
for
a
matter
of
six
hours
the
risk
had
to
be
taken
i
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
with
a
very
depressed
mind
from
the
map
it
seemed
that
a
short
cut
lay
over
a
pass
in
the
range
i
resolved
to
take
it
and
that
short
cut
like
most
of
its
kind
was
unblessed
by
heaven
i
will
not
dwell
upon
the
discomforts
of
the
journey
i
found
myself
slithering
among
screes
climbing
steep
chimneys
and
travelling
precariously
along
the
shoes
were
nearly
rent
from
my
feet
by
the
infernal
rocks
which
were
all
pitted
as
if
by
some
geological
when
at
last
i
crossed
the
divide
i
had
a
horrible
business
getting
down
from
one
level
to
another
in
a
gruesome
corrie
where
each
step
was
composed
of
smooth
but
at
last
i
was
among
the
bogs
on
the
east
side
and
came
to
the
place
beside
the
road
where
i
had
fixed
my
cache
the
faithful
amos
had
not
failed
me
there
were
the
provisions
a
couple
of
small
loaves
a
dozen
tins
and
a
bottle
of
whisky
i
made
the
best
pack
i
could
of
them
in
my
waterproof
swung
it
on
my
stick
and
started
back
thinking
that
i
must
be
very
like
the
picture
of
christian
on
the
of
i
was
liker
christian
before
i
reached
my
destination
christian
after
he
had
got
up
the
hill
difficulty
the
morning
walk
had
been
bad
but
the
afternoon
was
worse
for
i
was
in
a
fever
to
get
back
and
having
had
enough
of
the
hills
chose
the
longer
route
i
had
followed
the
previous
day
i
was
mortally
afraid
of
being
seen
for
i
cut
a
queer
figure
so
i
avoided
every
stretch
of
road
where
i
had
not
a
clear
view
ahead
many
weary
detours
i
made
among
and
screes
and
the
stony
channels
of
burns
but
i
got
there
at
last
and
it
was
almost
with
a
sense
of
comfort
that
i
flung
my
pack
down
beside
the
stream
where
i
had
passed
the
night
i
ate
a
good
meal
lit
my
pipe
and
fell
into
the
equable
mood
which
follows
upon
fatigue
ended
and
hunger
satisfied
the
sun
was
westering
and
its
light
fell
upon
the
above
the
place
where
i
had
abandoned
my
search
for
the
spoor
as
i
gazed
at
it
idly
i
saw
a
curious
thing
it
seemed
to
be
split
in
two
and
a
shaft
of
sunlight
came
through
between
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
i
saw
the
end
of
the
shaft
on
the
moor
beneath
while
all
the
rest
lay
in
shadow
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
got
out
my
glasses
then
i
guessed
the
explanation
there
was
a
rock
tower
close
against
the
face
of
the
main
precipice
and
indistinguishable
from
it
to
anyone
looking
direct
at
the
face
only
when
the
sun
fell
on
it
obliquely
could
it
be
discovered
and
between
the
tower
and
the
cliff
there
must
be
a
substantial
hollow
the
discovery
brought
me
to
my
feet
and
set
me
running
towards
the
end
of
the
shaft
of
sunlight
i
left
the
heather
scrambled
up
some
yards
of
screes
and
had
a
difficult
time
on
some
very
smooth
slabs
where
only
the
friction
of
tweed
and
rough
rock
gave
me
a
hold
slowly
i
worked
my
way
towards
the
speck
of
sunlight
till
i
found
a
handhold
and
swung
myself
into
the
crack
on
one
side
was
the
main
wall
of
the
hill
on
the
other
a
tower
some
ninety
feet
high
and
between
them
a
long
crevice
varying
in
width
from
three
to
six
feet
beyond
it
there
showed
a
small
bright
patch
of
sea
there
was
more
for
at
the
point
where
i
entered
it
there
was
an
overhang
which
made
a
fine
cavern
low
at
the
entrance
but
a
dozen
feet
high
inside
and
as
dry
as
tinder
here
thought
i
is
the
perfect
before
going
farther
i
resolved
to
return
for
food
it
was
not
very
easy
descending
and
i
slipped
the
last
twenty
feet
landing
on
my
head
in
a
soft
patch
of
screes
at
the
burnside
i
filled
my
flask
from
the
whisky
bottle
and
put
half
a
loaf
a
tin
of
sardines
a
tin
of
tongue
and
a
packet
of
chocolate
in
my
waterproof
pockets
laden
as
i
was
it
took
me
some
time
to
get
up
again
but
i
managed
it
and
stored
my
belongings
in
a
corner
of
the
cave
then
i
set
out
to
explore
the
rest
of
the
crack
it
slanted
down
and
then
rose
again
to
a
small
platform
after
that
it
dropped
in
easy
steps
to
the
moor
beyond
the
tower
if
the
portuguese
jew
had
come
here
that
was
the
way
by
which
he
had
reached
it
for
he
would
not
have
had
the
time
to
make
my
ascent
i
went
very
cautiously
for
i
felt
i
was
on
the
eve
of
a
big
discovery
the
platform
was
partly
hidden
from
my
end
by
a
bend
in
the
crack
and
it
was
more
or
less
screened
by
an
outlying
bastion
of
the
tower
from
the
other
side
its
surface
was
covered
with
fine
powdery
dust
as
were
the
steps
beyond
it
in
some
excitement
i
knelt
down
and
examined
it
beyond
doubt
there
was
spoor
here
i
knew
the
portuguese
footmarks
by
this
time
and
i
made
them
out
clearly
especially
in
one
corner
but
there
were
other
footsteps
quite
different
the
one
showed
the
rackets
of
rough
country
boots
the
others
were
from
soles
again
i
longed
for
peter
to
make
certain
though
i
was
pretty
sure
of
my
conclusions
the
man
i
had
followed
had
come
here
and
he
had
not
stayed
long
someone
else
had
been
here
probably
later
for
the
shoes
overlaid
the
rackets
the
first
man
might
have
left
a
message
for
the
second
perhaps
the
second
was
that
human
presence
of
which
i
had
been
dimly
conscious
in
the
i
carefully
removed
all
traces
of
my
own
footmarks
and
went
back
to
my
cave
my
head
was
humming
with
my
discovery
i
remembered
word
to
his
friend
night
as
i
read
it
the
portuguese
jew
had
taken
a
message
from
gresson
to
someone
and
that
someone
had
come
from
somewhere
and
picked
it
up
the
message
contained
an
assignation
for
this
very
night
i
had
found
a
point
of
observation
for
no
one
was
likely
to
come
near
my
cave
which
was
reached
from
the
moor
by
such
a
toilsome
climb
there
i
should
bivouac
and
see
what
the
darkness
brought
forth
i
remember
reflecting
on
the
amazing
luck
which
had
so
far
attended
me
as
i
looked
from
my
refuge
at
the
blue
haze
of
twilight
creeping
over
the
waters
i
felt
my
pulses
quicken
with
a
wild
anticipation
then
i
heard
a
sound
below
me
and
craned
my
neck
round
the
edge
of
the
tower
a
man
was
climbing
up
the
rock
by
the
way
i
had
come
chapter
seven
i
hear
of
the
wild
birds
i
saw
an
old
green
felt
hat
and
below
it
lean
shoulders
then
i
saw
a
knapsack
with
a
stick
slung
through
it
as
the
owner
wriggled
his
way
on
to
a
shelf
presently
he
turned
his
face
upward
to
judge
the
remaining
distance
it
was
the
face
of
a
young
man
a
face
sallow
and
angular
but
now
a
little
flushed
with
the
day
sun
and
the
work
of
climbing
it
was
a
face
that
i
had
first
seen
at
fosse
manor
i
felt
suddenly
sick
and
heartsore
i
do
know
why
but
i
had
never
really
associated
the
intellectuals
of
biggleswick
with
a
business
like
this
none
of
them
but
ivery
and
he
was
different
they
had
been
silly
and
priggish
but
no
more
i
would
have
taken
my
oath
on
it
yet
here
was
one
of
them
engaged
in
black
treason
against
his
native
land
something
began
to
beat
in
my
temples
when
i
remembered
that
mary
and
this
man
had
been
friends
that
he
had
held
her
hand
and
called
her
by
her
christian
name
my
first
impulse
was
to
wait
till
he
got
up
and
then
pitch
him
down
among
the
boulders
and
let
his
german
accomplices
puzzle
over
his
broken
neck
with
difficulty
i
kept
down
that
tide
of
fury
i
had
my
duty
to
do
and
to
keep
on
terms
with
this
man
was
part
of
it
i
had
to
convince
him
that
i
was
an
accomplice
and
that
might
not
be
easy
i
leaned
over
the
edge
and
as
he
got
to
his
feet
on
the
ledge
above
the
i
whistled
so
that
he
turned
his
face
to
me
wake
said
he
started
stared
for
a
second
and
recognized
me
he
did
not
seem
to
see
me
he
cried
did
you
get
here
he
swung
himself
up
beside
me
straightened
his
back
and
unbuckled
his
knapsack
thought
this
was
my
own
private
sanctuary
and
that
nobody
knew
it
but
me
have
you
spotted
the
cave
it
the
best
bedroom
in
skye
his
tone
was
as
usual
rather
acid
that
little
hammer
was
beating
in
my
head
i
longed
to
get
my
hands
on
his
throat
and
choke
the
smug
treason
in
him
but
i
kept
my
mind
fixed
on
one
purpose
to
persuade
him
that
i
shared
his
secret
and
was
on
his
side
his
seemed
only
the
clever
screen
of
the
surprised
conspirator
who
was
hunting
for
a
plan
we
entered
the
cave
and
he
flung
his
pack
into
a
corner
time
i
was
here
he
said
covered
the
floor
with
heather
we
must
get
some
more
if
we
would
sleep
soft
in
the
twilight
he
was
a
dim
figure
but
he
seemed
a
new
man
from
the
one
i
had
last
seen
in
the
moot
hall
at
biggleswick
there
was
a
wiry
vigour
in
his
body
and
a
purpose
in
his
face
what
a
fool
i
had
been
to
set
him
down
as
no
more
than
a
conceited
fidneur
he
went
out
to
the
shelf
again
and
sniffed
the
fresh
evening
there
was
a
wonderful
red
sky
in
the
west
but
in
the
crevice
the
shades
had
fallen
and
only
the
bright
patches
at
either
end
told
of
the
sunset
i
said
and
i
have
to
understand
each
other
i
a
friend
of
ivery
and
i
know
the
meaning
of
this
place
i
discovered
it
by
accident
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
heart
and
soul
with
you
you
may
trust
me
in
tonight
job
as
if
i
were
ivery
himself
he
swung
round
and
looked
at
me
sharply
his
eyes
were
hot
again
as
i
remembered
them
at
our
first
meeting
do
you
mean
how
much
do
you
know
the
hammer
was
going
hard
in
my
forehead
and
i
had
to
pull
myself
together
to
answer
know
that
at
the
end
of
this
crack
a
message
was
left
last
night
and
that
someone
came
out
of
the
sea
and
picked
it
up
that
someone
is
coming
again
when
darkness
falls
and
there
will
be
another
message
he
had
turned
his
head
away
are
talking
nonsense
no
submarine
could
land
on
this
coast
i
could
see
that
he
was
trying
me
morning
i
said
swam
in
the
inlet
below
us
it
is
the
most
perfect
submarine
shelter
in
britain
he
still
kept
his
face
from
me
looking
the
way
he
had
come
for
a
moment
he
was
silent
and
then
he
spoke
in
the
bitter
drawling
voice
which
had
annoyed
me
at
fosse
manor
do
you
reconcile
this
business
with
your
principles
mr
brand
you
were
always
a
patriot
i
remember
though
you
did
see
eye
to
eye
with
the
government
it
was
not
quite
what
i
expected
and
i
was
unready
i
stammered
in
my
reply
because
i
am
a
patriot
that
i
want
peace
i
think
that
i
mean
you
are
willing
to
help
the
enemy
to
win
have
already
won
i
want
that
recognized
and
the
end
hurried
on
i
was
getting
my
mind
clearer
and
continued
fluently
longer
the
war
lasts
the
worse
this
country
is
ruined
we
must
make
the
people
realize
the
truth
and
but
he
swung
round
suddenly
his
eyes
blazing
blackguard
he
cried
damnable
blackguard
and
he
flung
himself
on
me
like
a
i
had
got
my
answer
he
did
not
believe
me
he
knew
me
for
a
spy
and
he
was
determined
to
do
me
in
we
were
beyond
finesse
now
and
back
at
the
old
barbaric
game
it
was
his
life
or
mine
the
hammer
beat
furiously
in
my
head
as
we
closed
and
a
fierce
satisfaction
rose
in
my
heart
he
never
had
a
chance
for
though
he
was
in
good
trim
and
had
the
light
wiry
figure
of
the
mountaineer
he
had
a
quarter
of
my
muscular
strength
besides
he
was
wrongly
placed
for
he
had
the
outside
station
had
he
been
on
the
inside
he
might
have
toppled
me
over
the
edge
by
his
sudden
assault
as
it
was
i
grappled
him
and
forced
him
to
the
ground
squeezing
the
breath
out
of
his
body
in
the
process
i
must
have
hurt
him
considerably
but
he
never
gave
a
cry
with
a
good
deal
of
trouble
i
lashed
his
hands
behind
his
back
with
the
belt
of
my
waterproof
carried
him
inside
the
cave
and
laid
him
in
the
dark
end
of
it
then
i
tied
his
feet
with
the
strap
of
his
own
knapsack
i
would
have
to
gag
him
but
that
could
wait
i
had
still
to
contrive
a
plan
of
action
for
the
night
for
i
did
not
know
what
part
he
had
been
meant
to
play
in
it
he
might
be
the
messenger
instead
of
the
portuguese
jew
in
which
case
he
would
have
papers
about
his
person
if
he
knew
of
the
cave
others
might
have
the
same
knowledge
and
i
had
better
shift
him
before
they
came
i
looked
at
my
and
the
luminous
dial
showed
that
the
hour
was
half
past
nine
then
i
noticed
that
the
bundle
in
the
corner
was
sobbing
it
was
a
horrid
sound
and
it
worried
me
i
had
a
little
pocket
electric
torch
and
i
flashed
it
on
wake
face
if
he
was
crying
it
was
with
dry
eyes
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
he
asked
depends
i
said
grimly
i
ready
i
may
be
a
poor
creature
but
i
damned
if
afraid
of
you
or
anything
like
you
that
was
a
brave
thing
to
say
for
it
was
a
lie
his
teeth
were
chattering
ready
for
a
deal
i
said
wo
get
it
was
his
answer
my
throat
if
you
mean
to
but
for
god
sake
do
insult
me
i
choke
when
i
think
about
you
you
come
to
us
and
we
welcome
you
and
receive
you
in
our
houses
and
tell
you
our
inmost
thoughts
and
all
the
time
you
a
bloody
traitor
you
want
to
sell
us
to
germany
you
may
win
now
but
by
god
your
time
will
come
that
is
my
last
word
to
you
you
swine
the
hammer
stopped
beating
in
my
head
i
saw
myself
suddenly
as
a
blind
preposterous
fool
i
strode
over
to
wake
and
he
shut
his
eyes
as
if
he
expected
a
blow
instead
i
unbuckled
the
straps
which
held
his
legs
and
arms
old
fellow
i
said
the
worst
kind
of
idiot
i
eat
all
the
dirt
you
want
i
give
you
leave
to
knock
me
black
and
blue
and
i
wo
lift
a
hand
but
not
now
now
we
another
job
on
hand
man
we
on
the
same
side
and
i
never
knew
it
it
too
bad
a
case
for
apologies
but
if
it
any
consolation
to
you
i
feel
the
lowest
dog
in
europe
at
this
moment
he
was
sitting
up
rubbing
his
bruised
shoulders
do
you
mean
he
asked
hoarsely
mean
that
you
and
i
are
allies
my
name
not
brand
i
a
soldier
a
general
if
you
want
to
know
i
went
to
biggleswick
under
orders
and
i
came
chasing
up
here
on
the
same
job
ivery
the
biggest
german
agent
in
britain
and
i
after
him
i
struck
his
communication
lines
and
this
very
night
please
god
we
get
the
last
clue
to
the
riddle
do
you
hear
we
in
this
business
together
and
you
got
to
lend
a
hand
i
told
him
briefly
the
story
of
gresson
and
how
i
had
tracked
his
man
here
as
i
talked
we
ate
our
supper
and
i
wish
i
could
have
watched
wake
face
he
asked
questions
for
he
was
convinced
in
a
hurry
i
think
it
was
my
mention
of
mary
lamington
that
did
the
trick
i
know
why
but
that
seemed
to
satisfy
him
but
he
was
going
to
give
himself
away
may
count
on
me
he
said
this
is
black
blackguardly
treason
but
you
know
my
politics
and
i
do
change
them
for
this
i
more
against
your
accursed
war
than
ever
now
that
i
know
what
war
involves
i
said
a
pacifist
myself
you
wo
get
any
heroics
about
war
from
me
i
all
for
peace
but
we
got
to
down
those
devils
first
it
was
safe
for
either
of
us
to
stick
in
that
cave
so
we
cleared
away
the
marks
of
our
occupation
and
hid
our
packs
in
a
deep
crevice
on
the
rock
wake
announced
his
intention
of
climbing
the
tower
while
there
was
still
a
faint
afterglow
of
light
broad
on
the
top
and
i
can
keep
a
watch
out
to
sea
if
any
light
shows
i
been
up
it
before
i
found
the
way
two
years
ago
no
i
wo
fall
asleep
and
tumble
off
i
slept
most
of
the
afternoon
on
the
top
of
sgurr
vhiconnich
and
i
as
wakeful
as
a
bat
now
i
watched
him
shin
up
the
face
of
the
tower
and
admired
greatly
the
speed
and
neatness
with
which
he
climbed
then
i
followed
the
crevice
southward
to
the
hollow
just
below
the
platform
where
i
had
found
the
footmarks
there
was
a
big
boulder
there
which
partly
shut
off
the
view
of
it
from
the
direction
of
our
cave
the
place
was
perfect
for
my
purpose
for
between
the
boulder
and
the
wall
of
the
tower
was
a
narrow
gap
through
which
i
could
hear
all
that
passed
on
the
platform
i
found
a
stance
where
i
could
rest
in
comfort
and
keep
an
eye
through
the
crack
on
what
happened
beyond
there
was
still
a
faint
light
on
the
platform
but
soon
that
disappeared
and
black
darkness
settled
down
on
the
hills
it
was
the
dark
of
the
moon
and
as
had
happened
the
night
before
a
thin
wrack
blew
over
the
sky
hiding
the
stars
the
place
was
very
still
though
now
and
then
would
come
the
cry
of
a
bird
from
the
crags
that
beetled
above
me
and
from
the
shore
the
pipe
of
a
tern
or
an
owl
hooted
from
somewhere
up
on
the
tower
that
i
reckoned
was
wake
so
i
hooted
back
and
was
answered
i
unbuckled
my
and
pocketed
it
lest
its
luminous
dial
should
betray
me
and
i
noticed
that
the
hour
was
close
on
eleven
i
had
already
removed
my
shoes
and
my
jacket
was
buttoned
at
the
collar
so
as
to
show
no
shirt
i
did
not
think
that
the
coming
visitor
would
trouble
to
explore
the
crevice
beyond
the
platform
but
i
wanted
to
be
prepared
for
emergencies
then
followed
an
hour
of
waiting
i
felt
wonderfully
cheered
and
exhilarated
for
wake
had
restored
my
confidence
in
human
nature
in
that
eerie
place
we
were
wrapped
round
with
mystery
like
a
fog
some
unknown
figure
was
coming
out
of
the
sea
the
emissary
of
that
power
we
had
been
at
grips
with
for
three
years
it
was
as
if
the
war
had
just
made
contact
with
our
own
shores
and
never
not
even
when
i
was
alone
in
the
south
german
forest
had
i
felt
so
much
the
sport
of
a
whimsical
fate
i
only
wished
peter
could
have
been
with
me
and
so
my
thoughts
fled
to
peter
in
his
prison
camp
and
i
longed
for
another
sight
of
my
old
friend
as
a
girl
longs
for
her
lover
then
i
heard
the
hoot
of
an
owl
and
presently
the
sound
of
careful
steps
fell
on
my
ear
i
could
see
nothing
but
i
guessed
it
was
the
portuguese
jew
for
i
could
hear
the
grinding
of
heavily
nailed
boots
on
the
gritty
rock
the
figure
was
very
quiet
it
appeared
to
be
sitting
down
and
then
it
rose
and
fumbled
with
the
wall
of
the
tower
just
beyond
the
boulder
behind
which
i
sheltered
it
seemed
to
move
a
stone
and
to
replace
it
after
that
came
silence
and
then
once
more
the
hoot
of
an
owl
there
were
steps
on
the
rock
staircase
the
steps
of
a
man
who
did
not
know
the
road
well
and
stumbled
a
little
also
they
were
the
steps
of
one
without
nails
in
his
boots
they
reached
the
platform
and
someone
spoke
it
was
the
portuguese
jew
and
he
spoke
in
good
german
voegelein
schweigen
im
walde
he
said
the
answer
came
from
a
clear
authoritative
voice
nur
balde
ruhest
du
clearly
some
kind
of
password
for
sane
men
do
talk
about
little
birds
in
that
kind
of
situation
it
sounded
to
me
like
indifferent
poetry
then
followed
a
conversation
in
low
tones
of
which
i
only
caught
odd
phrases
i
heard
two
names
chelius
and
what
sounded
like
a
dutch
word
bommaerts
then
to
my
joy
i
caught
and
when
uttered
it
seemed
to
be
followed
by
a
laugh
i
heard
too
a
phrase
several
times
repeated
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
pure
gibberish
stubenvogel
it
was
spoken
by
the
man
from
the
sea
and
then
the
word
the
pair
seemed
demented
about
birds
for
a
second
an
electric
torch
was
flashed
in
the
shelter
of
the
rock
and
i
could
see
a
tanned
bearded
face
looking
at
some
papers
the
light
disappeared
and
again
the
portuguese
jew
was
fumbling
with
the
stones
at
the
base
of
the
tower
to
my
joy
he
was
close
to
my
crack
and
i
could
hear
every
word
can
not
come
here
very
often
he
said
it
may
be
hard
to
arrange
a
meeting
see
therefore
the
place
i
have
made
to
put
the
when
i
get
a
chance
i
will
come
here
and
you
will
come
also
when
you
are
able
often
there
will
be
nothing
but
sometimes
there
will
be
much
my
luck
was
clearly
in
and
my
exultation
made
me
careless
a
stone
on
which
a
foot
rested
slipped
and
though
i
checked
myself
at
once
the
confounded
thing
rolled
down
into
the
hollow
making
a
great
clatter
i
plastered
myself
in
the
embrasure
of
the
rock
and
waited
with
a
beating
heart
the
place
was
pitch
dark
but
they
had
an
electric
torch
and
if
they
once
flashed
it
on
me
i
was
gone
i
heard
them
leave
the
platform
and
climb
down
into
the
hollow
there
they
stood
listening
while
i
held
my
breath
then
i
heard
mein
freund
and
the
two
went
back
the
naval
officer
boots
slipping
on
the
gravel
they
did
not
leave
the
platform
together
the
man
from
the
sea
bade
a
short
farewell
to
the
portuguese
jew
listening
i
thought
impatiently
to
his
final
message
as
if
eager
to
be
gone
it
was
a
good
before
the
latter
took
himself
off
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
his
nailed
boots
die
away
as
he
reached
the
heather
of
the
moor
i
waited
a
little
longer
and
then
crawled
back
to
the
cave
the
owl
hooted
and
presently
wake
descended
lightly
beside
me
he
must
have
known
every
foothold
and
handhold
by
heart
to
do
the
job
in
that
inky
blackness
i
remember
that
he
asked
no
question
of
me
but
he
used
language
rare
on
the
lips
of
conscientious
objectors
about
the
men
who
had
lately
been
in
the
crevice
we
who
four
hours
earlier
had
been
at
death
grips
now
curled
up
on
the
hard
floor
like
two
tired
dogs
and
fell
sound
asleep
i
woke
to
find
wake
in
a
thundering
bad
temper
the
thing
he
remembered
most
about
the
night
before
was
our
scrap
and
the
gross
way
i
had
insulted
him
i
did
blame
him
for
if
any
man
had
taken
me
for
a
german
spy
i
would
have
been
out
for
his
blood
and
it
was
no
good
explaining
that
he
had
given
me
grounds
for
suspicion
he
was
as
touchy
about
his
blessed
principles
as
an
old
maid
about
her
age
i
was
feeling
rather
extra
buckish
myself
and
that
did
improve
matters
his
face
was
like
a
gargoyle
as
we
went
down
to
the
beach
to
bathe
so
i
held
my
tongue
he
was
chewing
the
cud
of
his
wounded
pride
but
the
salt
water
cleared
out
the
dregs
of
his
distemper
you
be
peevish
swimming
in
that
jolly
shining
sea
we
raced
each
other
away
beyond
the
inlet
to
the
outer
water
which
a
brisk
morning
breeze
was
curling
then
back
to
a
promontory
of
heather
where
the
first
beams
of
the
sun
coming
over
the
coolin
dried
our
skins
he
sat
hunched
up
staring
at
the
mountains
while
i
prospected
the
rocks
at
the
edge
out
in
the
minch
two
destroyers
were
hurrying
southward
and
i
wondered
where
in
that
waste
of
blue
was
the
craft
which
had
come
here
in
the
night
watches
i
found
the
spoor
of
the
man
from
the
sea
quite
fresh
on
a
patch
of
gravel
above
the
our
friend
of
the
night
i
said
believe
the
whole
thing
was
a
whimsy
said
wake
his
eyes
on
the
chimneys
of
sgurr
dearg
were
only
two
natives
poachers
perhaps
or
tinkers
do
speak
german
in
these
parts
was
gaelic
probably
do
you
make
of
this
then
and
i
quoted
the
stuff
about
birds
with
which
they
had
greeted
each
other
wake
looked
interested
allen
have
you
ever
read
goethe
a
word
and
what
do
you
make
of
that
i
pointed
to
a
flat
rock
below
covered
with
a
tangle
of
seaweed
it
was
of
a
softer
stone
than
the
hard
stuff
in
the
hills
and
somebody
had
scraped
off
half
the
seaweed
and
a
slice
of
the
side
was
done
yesterday
morning
for
i
had
my
bath
here
wake
got
up
and
examined
the
place
he
nosed
about
in
the
crannies
of
the
rocks
lining
the
inlet
and
got
into
the
water
again
to
explore
better
when
he
joined
me
he
was
smiling
apologize
for
my
scepticism
he
said
been
some
craft
here
in
the
night
i
can
smell
it
for
i
a
nose
like
a
retriever
i
daresay
you
on
the
right
track
anyhow
though
you
seem
to
know
a
bit
about
german
you
could
scarcely
invent
immortal
poetry
we
took
our
belongings
to
a
green
crook
of
the
burn
and
made
a
very
good
breakfast
wake
had
nothing
in
his
pack
but
plasmon
biscuits
and
raisins
for
that
he
said
was
his
mountaineering
provender
but
he
was
not
averse
to
sampling
my
tinned
stuff
he
was
a
fellow
out
in
the
hills
from
the
anaemic
intellectual
of
biggleswick
he
had
forgotten
his
beastly
and
spoke
of
his
hobby
with
a
serious
passion
it
seemed
he
had
scrambled
about
everywhere
in
europe
from
the
caucasus
to
the
pyrenees
i
could
see
he
must
be
good
at
the
job
for
he
did
brag
of
his
exploits
it
was
the
mountains
that
he
loved
not
wriggling
his
body
up
hard
places
the
coolin
he
said
were
his
favourites
for
on
some
of
them
you
could
get
two
thousand
feet
of
good
rock
we
got
our
glasses
on
the
face
of
sgurr
alasdair
and
he
sketched
out
for
me
various
ways
of
getting
to
its
grim
summit
the
coolin
and
the
dolomites
for
him
for
he
had
grown
tired
of
the
chamonix
aiguilles
i
remember
he
described
with
tremendous
gusto
the
joys
of
early
dawn
in
tyrol
when
you
ascended
through
acres
of
flowery
meadows
to
a
tooth
of
clean
white
limestone
against
a
clean
blue
sky
he
spoke
too
of
the
little
wild
hills
in
the
bavarian
wettersteingebirge
and
of
a
guide
he
had
picked
up
there
and
trained
to
the
job
called
him
sebastian
buchwieser
he
was
the
jolliest
boy
you
ever
saw
and
as
clever
on
crags
as
a
chamois
he
is
probably
dead
by
now
dead
in
a
filthy
jaeger
battalion
that
you
and
your
accursed
war
we
got
to
get
busy
and
end
it
in
the
right
way
i
said
you
got
to
help
my
lad
he
was
a
good
draughtsman
and
with
his
assistance
i
drew
a
rough
map
of
the
crevice
where
we
had
roosted
for
the
night
giving
its
bearings
carefully
in
relation
to
the
burn
and
the
sea
then
i
wrote
down
all
the
details
about
gresson
and
the
portuguese
jew
and
described
the
latter
in
minute
detail
i
described
too
most
precisely
the
cache
where
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
messages
should
be
placed
that
finished
my
stock
of
paper
and
i
left
the
record
of
the
oddments
overheard
of
the
conversation
for
a
later
time
i
put
the
thing
in
an
old
leather
i
possessed
and
handed
it
to
wake
got
to
go
straight
off
to
the
kyle
and
not
waste
any
time
on
the
way
nobody
suspects
you
so
you
can
travel
any
road
you
please
when
you
get
there
you
ask
for
mr
andrew
amos
who
has
some
government
job
in
the
neighbourhood
give
him
that
paper
from
me
he
know
what
to
do
with
it
all
right
tell
him
i
get
somehow
to
the
kyle
before
midday
the
day
after
tomorrow
i
must
cover
my
tracks
a
bit
so
i
come
with
you
and
i
want
that
thing
in
his
hands
just
as
fast
as
your
legs
will
take
you
if
anyone
tries
to
steal
it
from
you
for
sake
eat
it
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
it
devilish
important
shall
be
back
in
england
in
three
days
he
said
message
for
your
other
friends
all
about
me
you
never
saw
me
here
i
still
brand
the
amiable
colonial
studying
social
movements
if
you
meet
ivery
say
you
heard
of
me
on
the
clyde
deep
in
sedition
but
if
you
see
miss
lamington
you
can
tell
her
i
past
the
hill
difficulty
i
coming
back
as
soon
as
god
will
let
me
and
i
going
to
drop
right
into
the
biggleswick
push
only
this
time
i
be
a
little
more
advanced
in
my
views
you
need
get
cross
i
not
saying
anything
against
your
principles
the
main
point
is
that
we
both
hate
dirty
treason
he
put
the
case
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
go
round
garsbheinn
he
said
over
by
camasunary
i
be
at
the
kyle
long
before
evening
i
meant
anyhow
to
sleep
at
broadford
tonight
goodbye
brand
for
i
forgotten
your
proper
name
you
not
a
bad
fellow
but
landed
me
in
melodrama
for
the
first
time
in
my
sober
existence
i
have
a
grudge
against
you
for
mixing
up
the
coolin
with
a
shilling
shocker
you
spoiled
their
sanctity
the
wrong
notion
of
romance
i
said
man
last
night
for
an
hour
you
were
in
the
front
line
the
place
where
the
enemy
forces
touch
our
own
you
were
over
the
top
you
were
in
he
laughed
is
one
way
to
look
at
it
and
then
he
stalked
off
and
i
watched
his
lean
figure
till
it
was
round
the
turn
of
the
hill
all
that
morning
i
smoked
peacefully
by
the
burn
and
let
my
thoughts
wander
over
the
whole
business
i
had
got
precisely
what
blenkiron
wanted
a
post
office
for
the
enemy
it
would
need
careful
handling
but
i
could
see
the
juiciest
lies
passing
that
way
to
the
yet
i
had
an
ugly
feeling
at
the
back
of
my
head
that
it
had
been
all
too
easy
and
that
ivery
was
not
the
man
to
be
duped
in
this
way
for
long
that
set
me
thinking
about
the
queer
talk
on
the
crevice
the
poetry
stuff
i
dismissed
as
the
ordinary
password
probably
changed
every
time
but
who
were
chelius
and
bommaerts
and
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
were
the
wild
birds
and
the
cage
birds
twice
in
the
past
three
years
i
had
had
two
such
riddles
to
solve
scudder
scribble
in
his
and
harry
three
words
i
remembered
how
it
had
only
been
by
constant
chewing
at
them
that
i
had
got
a
sort
of
meaning
and
i
wondered
if
fate
would
some
day
expound
this
puzzle
also
meantime
i
had
to
get
back
to
london
as
inconspicuously
as
i
had
come
it
might
take
some
doing
for
the
police
who
had
been
active
in
morvern
might
be
still
on
the
track
and
it
was
essential
that
i
should
keep
out
of
trouble
and
give
no
hint
to
gresson
and
his
friends
that
i
had
been
so
far
north
however
that
was
for
amos
to
advise
me
on
and
about
noon
i
picked
up
my
waterproof
with
its
bursting
pockets
and
set
off
on
a
long
detour
up
the
coast
all
that
blessed
day
i
scarcely
met
a
soul
i
passed
a
distillery
which
seemed
to
have
quit
business
and
in
the
evening
came
to
a
little
town
on
the
sea
where
i
had
a
bed
and
supper
in
a
superior
kind
of
next
day
i
struck
southward
along
the
coast
and
had
two
experiences
of
interest
i
had
a
good
look
at
ranna
and
observed
that
the
was
no
longer
there
gresson
had
only
waited
to
get
his
job
finished
he
could
probably
twist
the
old
captain
any
way
he
wanted
the
second
was
that
at
the
door
of
a
village
smithy
i
saw
the
back
of
the
portuguese
jew
he
was
talking
gaelic
this
time
good
gaelic
it
sounded
and
in
that
knot
of
idlers
he
would
have
passed
for
the
ordinariest
kind
of
gillie
he
did
not
see
me
and
i
had
no
desire
to
give
him
the
chance
for
i
had
an
odd
feeling
that
the
day
might
come
when
it
would
be
good
for
us
to
meet
as
strangers
that
night
i
put
up
boldly
in
the
inn
at
broadford
where
they
fed
me
nobly
on
fresh
and
i
first
tasted
an
excellent
liqueur
made
of
honey
and
whisky
next
morning
i
was
early
afoot
and
well
before
midday
was
in
sight
of
the
narrows
of
the
kyle
and
the
two
little
stone
clachans
which
face
each
other
across
the
strip
of
sea
about
two
miles
from
the
place
at
a
turn
of
the
road
i
came
upon
a
farmer
gig
drawn
up
by
the
wayside
with
the
horse
cropping
the
moorland
grass
a
man
sat
on
the
bank
smoking
with
his
left
arm
hooked
in
the
reins
he
was
an
oldish
man
with
a
short
square
figure
and
a
woollen
comforter
enveloped
his
throat
chapter

the
adventures
of
a
bagman
punctual
to
time
mr
brand
said
the
voice
of
amos
losh
man
what
have
ye
done
to
your
breeks
and
your
buits
ye
no
just
very
respectable
in
your
appearance
i
was
the
confounded
rocks
of
the
coolin
had
left
their
mark
on
my
shoes
which
moreover
had
not
been
cleaned
for
a
week
and
the
same
hills
had
rent
my
jacket
at
the
shoulders
and
torn
my
trousers
above
the
right
knee
and
stained
every
part
of
my
apparel
with
peat
and
lichen
i
cast
myself
on
the
bank
beside
amos
and
lit
my
pipe
you
get
my
message
i
asked
it
gone
on
by
a
sure
hand
to
the
destination
we
ken
of
managed
well
mr
brand
but
i
wish
ye
were
back
in
london
he
sucked
at
his
pipe
and
the
shaggy
brows
were
pulled
so
low
as
to
hide
the
wary
eyes
then
he
proceeded
to
think
aloud
canna
go
back
by
mallaig
i
do
just
understand
why
but
lookin
for
you
down
that
line
it
a
vexatious
business
when
your
friends
meanin
the
polis
are
doing
their
best
to
upset
your
plans
and
you
no
able
to
enlighten
them
i
could
send
word
to
the
chief
constable
and
get
ye
through
to
london
without
a
stop
like
a
load
of
fish
from
aiberdeen
but
that
would
be
spoilin
the
fine
character
ye
been
at
such
pains
to
construct
na
na
ye
maun
take
the
risk
and
travel
by
muirtown
without
ony
creedentials
ca
be
a
very
big
risk
i
interpolated
no
so
sure
gresson
left
the
he
went
by
here
yesterday
on
the
mallaig
boat
and
there
was
a

kyle
he
there
still
stoppin
at
the
hotel
they
ca

and
he
travels
in
whisky
i
do
like
the
looks
of
him
gresson
does
not
suspect
me
no
but
ye
wouldna
like
him
to
see
ye
hereaways
yon
gentry
do
leave
muckle
to
chance
be
very
certain
that
every
man
in
gresson
lot
kens
all
about
ye
and
has
your
description
down
to
the
mole
on
your
chin
they
got
it
wrong
i
replied

speakin
feeguratively
said
amos
was
considerin
your
case
the
feck
of
yesterday
and
i
brought
the
best
i
could
do
for
ye
in
the
gig
i
wish
ye
were
more
respectable
clad
but
a
good
topcoat
will
hide
defeecencies
from
behind
the
gig
seat
he
pulled
out
an
ancient
gladstone
bag
and
revealed
its
contents
there
was
a
bowler
of
a
vulgar
and
antiquated
style
there
was
a
overcoat
of
some
dark
cloth
of
the
kind
that
a
clerk
wears
on
the
road
to
the
office
there
was
a
pair
of
detachable
celluloid
cuffs
and
there
was
a
linen
collar
and
dickie
also
there
was
a
small
handcase
such
as
bagmen
carry
on
their
rounds
your
luggage
said
amos
with
pride
wee
bag
full
of
samples
ye
mind
i
took
the
precaution
of
measurin
ye
in
glasgow
so
the
things
fit
ye
got
a
new
name
mr
brand
and
i
taken
a
room
for
ye
in
the
hotel
on
the
strength
of
it
ye
archibald
mccaskie
and
ye
travellin
for
the
firm
o
todd
sons
brothers
of
edinburgh
ye
ken
the
folk
they
publish
wee
releegious
books
that
ye
bin
trying
to
sell
for
prizes
to
the
free
kirk
ministers
in
skye
the
notion
amused
amos
and
he
relapsed
into
the
sombre
chuckle
which
with
him
did
duty
for
a
laugh
i
put
my
hat
and
waterproof
in
the
bag
and
donned
the
bowler
and
the
they
fitted
fairly
well
likewise
the
cuffs
and
collar
though
here
i
struck
a
snag
for
i
had
lost
my
scarf
somewhere
in
the
coolin
and
amos
had
to
surrender
the
rusty
black
tie
which
adorned
his
own
person
it
was
a
queer
rig
and
i
felt
like
nothing
on
earth
in
it
but
amos
was
satisfied
mccaskie
sir
he
said
the
very
model
of
a
traveller
ye
better
learn
a
few
biographical
details
which
maybe
forgotten
ye
an
edinburgh
man
but
ye
were
some
years
in
london
which
explains
the
way
ye
speak
ye
bide
at
russell
street
off
the
meadows
and
ye
an
elder
in
the
nethergate
kirk
have
ye
ony
special
taste
ye
could
lead
the
crack
on
to
if
ye
engaged
in
conversation
i
suggested
the
english
classics
very
suitable
ye
can
try
poalitics
too
ye
better
be
a
but
convertit
by
lloyd
george
that
a
common
case
and
ye
need
to
be
common
if
i
was
you
i
would
daunder
about
here
for
a
bit
and
no
arrive
at
your
hotel
till
after
dark
then
ye
can
have
your
supper
and
gang
to
bed
the
muirtown
train
leaves
at
in
the
morning
na
ye
ca
come
with
me
it
wouldna
do
for
us
to
be
seen
thegither
if
i
meet
ye
in
the
street
i
never
let
on
i
know
ye
amos
climbed
into
the
gig
and
jolted
off
home
i
went
down
to
the
shore
and
sat
among
the
rocks
finishing
about
the
remains
of
my
provisions
in
the
mellow
gloaming
i
strolled
into
the
clachan
and
got
a
boat
to
put
me
over
to
the
inn
it
proved
to
be
a
comfortable
place
with
a
motherly
old
landlady
who
showed
me
to
my
room
and
promised
ham
and
eggs
and
cold
salmon
for
supper
after
a
good
wash
which
i
needed
and
an
honest
attempt
to
make
my
clothes
presentable
i
descended
to
the
meal
in
a
lit
by
a
single
dim
parafin
lamp
the
food
was
excellent
and
as
i
ate
my
spirits
rose
in
two
days
i
should
be
back
in
london
beside
blenkiron
and
somewhere
within
a
journey
of
mary
i
could
picture
no
scene
now
without
thinking
how
mary
fitted
into
it
for
her
sake
i
held
biggleswick
delectable
because
i
had
seen
her
there
i
was
sure
if
this
was
love
but
it
was
something
i
had
never
dreamed
of
before
something
which
i
now
hugged
the
thought
of
it
made
the
whole
earth
rosy
and
golden
for
me
and
life
so
well
worth
living
that
i
felt
like
a
miser
towards
the
days
to
come
i
had
about
finished
supper
when
i
was
joined
by
another
guest
seen
in
the
light
of
that
infamous
lamp
he
seemed
a
small
alert
fellow
with
a
bushy
black
moustache
and
black
hair
parted
in
the
middle
he
had
fed
already
and
appeared
to
be
hungering
for
human
society
in
three
minutes
he
had
told
me
that
he
had
come
down
from
portree
and
was
on
his
way
to
leith
a
minute
later
he
had
whipped
out
a
card
on
which
i
read
linklater
and
in
the
corner
the
name
of
hatherwick
his
accent
betrayed
that
he
hailed
from
the
west
been
up
among
the
distilleries
he
informed
me
a
poor
business
distillin
in
these
times
wi
the
teetotallers
yowlin
about
the
nation
shame
and
the
way
to
lose
the
war
i
a
temperate
man
mysel
but
i
would
think
shame
to
spile
decent
folks
business
if
the
government
want
to
stop
the
drink
let
them
buy
us
out
permitted
us
to
invest
good
money
in
the
trade
and
they
must
see
that
we
get
it
back
the
other
way
will
wreck
public
credit
that
what
i
say
supposin
some
labour
government
takes
the
notion
that
soap
bad
for
the
nation
are
they
goin
to
shut
up
port
sunlight
or
good
clothes
or
lum
hats
there
no
end
to
their
daftness
if
they
once
start
on
that
track
a
lawfu
trade
a
lawfu
trade
says
i
and
contrary
to
public
policy
to
pit
it
at
the
mercy
of
wheen
cranks
d
no
agree
sir
by
the
way
i
havena
got
your
name
i
told
him
and
he
rambled
on
blenders
and
do
a
very
business
mostly
foreign
the
war
hit
us
wi
our
export
trade
of
course
but
we
no
as
bad
as
some
what
your
line
mr
mccaskie
when
he
heard
he
was
keenly
interested
d
say
so
ye
from
todd
man
i
was
in
the
book
business
mysel
till
i
changed
it
for
something
a
wee
bit
more
lucrative
i
was
on
the
road
for
three
years
for
andrew
matheson
ye
ken
the
name
paternoster
row
i
forgotten
the
number
i
had
a
kind
of
ambition
to
start
a
shop
of
my
own
and
to
make
linklater
o
paisley
a
big
name
in
the
trade
but
i
got
the
offer
from
hatherwick
and
i
was
wantin
to
get
married
so
filthy
lucre
won
the
day
and
i
no
sorry
i
changed
if
it
hadna
been
for
this
war
i
would
have
been
makin
four
figures
with
my
salary
and
commissions
my
pipe
out
have
you
one
of
those
rare
and
valuable
curiosities
called
a
spunk
mr
mccaskie
he
was
a
merry
little
grig
of
a
man
and
he
babbled
on
till
i
announced
my
intention
of
going
to
bed
if
this
was
amos
bagman
who
had
been
seen
in
company
with
gresson
i
understood
how
idle
may
be
the
suspicions
of
a
clever
man
he
had
probably
foregathered
with
gresson
on
the
skye
boat
and
wearied
that
saturnine
soul
with
his
cackle
i
was
up
betimes
paid
my
bill
ate
a
breakfast
of
porridge
and
fresh
haddock
and
walked
the
few
hundred
yards
to
the
station
it
was
a
warm
thick
morning
with
no
sun
visible
and
the
skye
hills
misty
to
their
base
the
three
coaches
on
the
little
train
were
nearly
filled
when
i
had
bought
my
ticket
and
i
selected
a
smoking
carriage
which
held
four
soldiers
returning
from
leave
the
train
was
already
moving
when
a
late
passenger
hurried
along
the
platform
and
clambered
in
beside
me
a
cheery
mr
mccaskie
revealed
my
fellow
guest
at
the
hotel
we
jolted
away
from
the
coast
up
a
broad
glen
and
then
on
to
a
wide
expanse
of
bog
with
big
hills
showing
towards
the
north
it
was
a
drowsy
day
and
in
that
atmosphere
of
shag
and
crowded
humanity
i
felt
my
eyes
closing
i
had
a
short
nap
and
woke
to
find
that
mr
linklater
had
changed
his
seat
and
was
now
beside
me
no
get
a
scotsman
till
muirtown
he
said
ye
nothing
in
your
samples
ye
could
give
me
to
read
i
had
forgotten
about
the
samples
i
opened
the
case
and
found
the
oddest
collection
of
little
books
all
in
gay
bindings
some
were
religious
with
names
like
of
and
some
were
innocent
narratives
tommy
saved
his
missionary
child
in
and
susie
and
her
there
was
a
of
david
a
child
book
on
and
a
richly
gilt
edition
of
the
poems
of
one
james
montgomery
i
offered
the
selection
to
mr
linklater
who
grinned
and
chose
the
missionary
child
not
the
reading
i
accustomed
to
he
said
like
strong
meat
hall
caine
and
jack
london
by
the
way
how
d
square
this
business
of
yours
the
booksellers
when
i
was
in
matheson
there
would
have
been
trouble
if
we
had
dealt
direct
wi
the
public
like
you
the
confounded
fellow
started
to
talk
about
the
details
of
the
book
trade
of
which
i
knew
nothing
he
wanted
to
know
on
what
terms
we
sold
and
what
discount
we
gave
the
big
wholesalers
and
what
class
of
book
we
put
out
sale
i
did
understand
a
word
of
his
jargon
and
i
must
have
given
myself
away
badly
for
he
asked
me
questions
about
firms
of
which
i
had
never
heard
and
i
had
to
make
some
kind
of
answer
i
told
myself
that
the
donkey
was
harmless
and
that
his
opinion
of
me
mattered
nothing
but
as
soon
as
i
decently
could
i
pretended
to
be
absorbed
in
the
a
gaudy
copy
of
which
was
among
the
samples
it
opened
at
the
episode
of
christian
and
hopeful
in
the
enchanted
ground
and
in
that
stuffy
carriage
i
presently
followed
the
example
of
heedless
and
and
fell
sound
asleep
i
was
awakened
by
the
train
rumbling
over
the
points
of
a
little
moorland
junction
sunk
in
a
pleasing
lethargy
i
sat
with
my
eyes
closed
and
then
covertly
took
a
glance
at
my
companion
he
had
abandoned
the
missionary
child
and
was
reading
a
little
book
and
marking
passages
with
a
pencil
his
face
was
absorbed
and
it
was
a
new
face
not
the
vacant
look
of
the
garrulous
bagman
but
something
shrewd
purposeful
and
formidable
i
remained
hunched
up
as
if
still
sleeping
and
tried
to
see
what
the
book
was
but
my
eyes
good
as
they
are
could
make
out
nothing
of
the
text
or
title
except
that
i
had
a
very
strong
impression
that
that
book
was
not
written
in
the
english
tongue
i
woke
abruptly
and
leaned
over
to
him
quick
as
lightning
he
slid
his
pencil
up
his
sleeve
and
turned
on
me
with
a
fatuous
smile
d
make
o
this
mr
mccaskie
it
a
wee
book
i
picked
up
at
a
roup
along
with
fifty
others
i
paid
five
shillings
for
the
lot
it
looks
like
gairman
but
in
my
young
days
they
didna
teach
us
foreign
languages
i
took
the
thing
and
turned
over
the
pages
trying
to
keep
any
sign
of
intelligence
out
of
my
face
it
was
german
right
enough
a
little
manual
of
hydrography
with
no
publisher
name
on
it
it
had
the
look
of
the
kind
of
textbook
a
government
department
might
issue
to
its
officials
i
handed
it
back
either
german
or
dutch
i
not
much
of
a
scholar
barring
a
little
french
and
the
latin
i
got
at
hospital
this
is
an
awful
slow
train
mr
linklater
the
soldiers
were
playing
nap
and
the
bagman
proposed
a
game
of
cards
i
remembered
in
time
that
i
was
an
elder
in
the
nethergate
church
and
refused
with
some
asperity
after
that
i
shut
my
eyes
again
for
i
wanted
to
think
out
this
new
phenomenon
the
fellow
knew
german
that
was
clear
he
had
also
been
seen
in
gresson
company
i
did
believe
he
suspected
me
though
i
suspected
him
profoundly
it
was
my
business
to
keep
strictly
to
my
part
and
give
him
no
cause
to
doubt
me
he
was
clearly
practising
his
own
part
on
me
and
i
must
appear
to
take
him
literally
on
his
professions
so
presently
i
woke
up
and
engaged
him
in
a
disputatious
conversation
about
the
morality
of
selling
strong
liquors
he
responded
readily
and
put
the
case
for
alcohol
with
much
point
and
vehemence
the
discussion
interested
the
soldiers
and
one
of
them
to
show
he
was
on
side
produced
a
flask
and
offered
him
a
drink
i
concluded
by
observing
morosely
that
the
bagman
had
been
a
better
man
when
he
peddled
books
for
alexander
matheson
and
that
put
the
closure
on
the
business
that
train
was
a
record
it
stopped
at
every
station
and
in
the
afternoon
it
simply
got
tired
and
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
a
moor
and
reflected
for
an
hour
i
stuck
my
head
out
of
the
window
now
and
then
and
smelt
the
rooty
fragrance
of
bogs
and
when
we
halted
on
a
bridge
i
watched
the
trout
in
the
pools
of
the
brown
river
then
i
slept
and
smoked
alternately
and
began
to
get
furiously
hungry
once
i
woke
to
hear
the
soldiers
discussing
the
war
there
was
an
argument
between
a
in
the
camerons
and
a
sapper
private
about
some
trivial
incident
on
the
somme
tell
ye
i
was
there
said
the
cameron
were
relievin
the
black
watch
and
fritz
was
shelling
the
road
and
we
didna
get
up
to
the
line
till
one
in
the
mornin
frae
frickout
circus
to
the
south
end
o
the
high
wood
is
every
bit
o
five
mile
abune
three
said
the
sapper
dogmatically
i
trampit
it
here
i
took
up
wire
every
nicht
for
a
week
the
cameron
looked
moodily
round
the
company
wish
there
was
anither
man
here
that
kent
the
place
he
wad
bear
me
out
these
boys
are
no
good
for
they
didna
join
till
later
i
tell
ye
it
five
mile
said
the
sapper
tempers
were
rising
for
each
of
the
disputants
felt
his
veracity
assailed
it
was
too
hot
for
a
quarrel
and
i
was
so
drowsy
that
i
was
heedless
up
you
fools
i
said
distance
is
six
kilometres
so
you
both
wrong
my
tone
was
so
familiar
to
the
men
that
it
stopped
the
wrangle
but
it
was
not
the
tone
of
a
publisher
traveller
mr
linklater
cocked
his
ears
a
kilometre
mr
mccaskie
he
asked
blandly
by
five
and
divide
by
eight
and
you
get
the
miles
i
was
on
my
guard
now
and
told
a
long
story
of
a
nephew
who
had
been
killed
on
the
somme
and
how
i
had
corresponded
with
the
war
office
about
his
case
i
said
a
great
student
o
the
newspapers
and
i
read
all
the
books
about
the
war
it
a
difficult
time
this
for
us
all
and
if
you
can
take
a
serious
interest
in
the
campaign
it
helps
a
lot
i
mean
working
out
the
places
on
the
map
and
reading
haig
dispatches
so
he
said
dryly
and
i
thought
he
watched
me
with
an
odd
look
in
his
eyes
a
fresh
idea
possessed
me
this
man
had
been
in
gresson
company
he
knew
german
he
was
obviously
something
very
different
from
what
he
professed
to
be
what
if
he
were
in
the
employ
of
our
own
secret
service
i
had
appeared
out
of
the
void
at
the
kyle
and
i
had
made
but
a
poor
appearance
as
a
bagman
showing
no
knowledge
of
my
own
trade
i
was
in
an
area
interdicted
to
the
ordinary
public
and
he
had
good
reason
to
keep
an
eye
on
my
movements
he
was
going
south
and
so
was
i
clearly
we
must
somehow
part
company
change
at
muirtown
do
we
i
asked
does
the
train
for
the
south
leave
he
consulted
a
pocket
timetable
there
generally
four
hours
to
wait
for
we
due
in
at
but
this
auld
hearse
will
be
lucky
if
it
in
by
nine
his
forecast
was
correct
we
rumbled
out
of
the
hills
into
haughlands
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
north
sea
then
we
were
hung
up
while
a
long
goods
train
passed
down
the
line
it
was
almost
dark
when
at
last
we
crawled
into
muirtown
station
and
disgorged
our
load
of
hot
and
weary
soldiery
i
bade
an
ostentatious
farewell
to
linklater
pleased
to
have
met
you
i
see
you
later
on
the
edinburgh
train
i
for
a
walk
to
stretch
my
legs
and
a
bite
o
supper
i
was
very
determined
that
the
for
the
south
should
leave
without
me
my
notion
was
to
get
a
bed
and
a
meal
in
some
secluded
inn
and
walk
out
next
morning
and
pick
up
a
slow
train
down
the
line
linklater
had
disappeared
towards
the
guard
van
to
find
his
luggage
and
the
soldiers
were
sitting
on
their
packs
with
that
air
of
being
utterly
and
finally
lost
and
neglected
which
characterizes
the
british
on
a
journey
i
gave
up
my
ticket
and
since
i
had
come
off
a
northern
train
walked
unhindered
into
the
town
it
was
market
night
and
the
streets
were
crowded
from
the
fleet
in
to
shop
and
every
kind
of
military
detail
thronged
the
pavements
were
crying
their
wares
and
there
was
a
tatterdemalion
piper
making
the
night
hideous
at
a
corner
i
took
a
tortuous
route
and
finally
fixed
on
a
in
a
back
street
when
i
inquired
for
a
room
i
could
find
no
one
in
authority
but
a
slatternly
girl
informed
me
that
there
was
one
vacant
bed
and
that
i
could
have
ham
and
eggs
in
the
bar
so
after
hitting
my
head
violently
against
a
i
stumbled
down
some
steps
and
entered
a
frowsty
little
place
smelling
of
spilt
beer
and
stale
tobacco
the
promised
ham
and
eggs
proved
impossible
there
were
no
eggs
to
be
had
in
muirtown
that
night
but
i
was
given
cold
mutton
and
a
pint
of
indifferent
ale
there
was
nobody
in
the
place
but
two
farmers
drinking
hot
whisky
and
water
and
discussing
with
sombre
interest
the
rise
in
the
price
of
i
ate
my
supper
and
was
just
preparing
to
find
the
whereabouts
of
my
bedroom
when
through
the
street
door
there
entered
a
dozen
soldiers
in
a
second
the
quiet
place
became
a
babel
the
men
were
strictly
sober
but
they
were
in
that
temper
of
friendliness
which
demands
a
libation
of
some
kind
one
was
prepared
to
stand
treat
he
was
the
leader
of
the
lot
and
it
was
to
celebrate
the
end
of
his
leave
that
he
was
entertaining
his
pals
from
where
i
sat
i
could
not
see
him
but
his
voice
was
dominant
your
fancy
jock
beer
for
you
andra
a
pint
and
a
dram
for
me
this
is
better
than
vongblong
and
vongrooge
davie
man
when
i
sittin
in
those
estamints
as
they
ca
them
i
often
long
for
a
guid
scots
public
the
voice
was
familiar
i
shifted
my
seat
to
get
a
view
of
the
speaker
and
then
i
hastily
drew
back
it
was
the
scots
fusilier
i
had
clipped
on
the
jaw
in
defending
gresson
after
the
glasgow
meeting
but
by
a
strange
fatality
he
had
caught
sight
of
me
that
i
the
corner
he
cried
leaving
the
bar
to
stare
at
me
now
it
is
a
queer
thing
but
if
you
have
once
fought
with
a
man
though
only
for
a
few
seconds
you
remember
his
face
and
the
scrap
in
glasgow
had
been
under
a
lamp
the
jock
recognized
me
well
enough
god
he
cried
this
is
no
a
bit
o
luck
boys
here
the
man
i
feucht
wi
in
glesca
ye
mind
i
telled
ye
about
it
he
laid
me
oot
and
it
my
turn
to
do
the
same
wi
him
i
had
a
notion
i
was
gaun
to
mak
a
nicht
there
naebody
can
hit
geordie
hamilton
without
geordie
gettin
his
ain
back
some
day
get
up
man
for
i
gaun
to
knock
the
heid
off
ye
i
duly
got
up
and
with
the
best
composure
i
could
muster
looked
him
in
the
face
mistaken
my
friend
i
never
clapped
eyes
on
you
before
and
i
never
was
in
glasgow
in
my
life
a
damned
lee
said
the
fusilier
the
man
and
if
no
ye
like
enough
him
to
need
a
hidin
your
nonsense
i
said
no
quarrel
with
you
and
better
things
to
do
than
be
scrapping
with
a
stranger
in
a
ye
sae
well
i
learn
ye
better
i
gaun
to
hit
ye
and
then
ye
hae
to
fecht
whether
ye
want
it
or
no
tam
haud
my
jacket
and
see
that
my
drink
no
skailed
this
was
an
infernal
nuisance
for
a
row
here
would
bring
in
the
police
and
my
dubious
position
would
be
laid
bare
i
thought
of
putting
up
a
fight
for
i
was
certain
i
could
lay
out
the
jock
a
second
time
but
the
worst
of
that
was
that
i
did
not
know
where
the
thing
would
end
i
might
have
to
fight
the
lot
of
them
and
that
meant
a
noble
public
shindy
i
did
my
best
to
speak
my
opponent
fair
i
said
we
were
all
good
friends
and
offered
to
stand
drinks
for
the
party
but
the
fusilier
blood
was
up
and
he
was
spoiling
for
a
row
ably
abetted
by
his
comrades
he
had
his
tunic
off
now
and
was
stamping
in
front
of
me
with
doubled
fists
i
did
the
best
thing
i
could
think
of
in
the
circumstances
my
seat
was
close
to
the
steps
which
led
to
the
other
part
of
the
inn
i
grabbed
my
hat
darted
up
them
and
before
they
realized
what
i
was
doing
had
bolted
the
door
behind
me
i
could
hear
pandemonium
break
loose
in
the
bar
i
slipped
down
a
dark
passage
to
another
which
ran
at
right
angles
to
it
and
which
seemed
to
connect
the
street
door
of
the
inn
itself
with
the
back
premises
i
could
hear
voices
in
the
little
hall
and
that
stopped
me
short
one
of
them
was
linklater
but
he
was
not
talking
as
linklater
had
talked
he
was
speaking
educated
english
i
heard
another
with
a
scots
accent
which
i
took
to
be
the
landlord
and
a
third
which
sounded
like
some
superior
sort
of
constable
very
prompt
and
official
i
heard
one
phrase
too
from
linklater
calls
himself
mccaskie
then
they
stopped
for
the
turmoil
from
the
bar
had
reached
the
front
door
the
fusilier
and
his
friends
were
looking
for
me
by
the
other
entrance
the
attention
of
the
men
in
the
hall
was
distracted
and
that
gave
me
a
chance
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
the
back
door
i
slipped
through
it
into
a
courtyard
and
almost
tumbled
over
a
tub
of
water
i
planted
the
thing
so
that
anyone
coming
that
way
would
fall
over
it
a
door
led
me
into
an
empty
stable
and
from
that
into
a
lane
it
was
all
absurdly
easy
but
as
i
started
down
the
lane
i
heard
a
mighty
row
and
the
sound
of
angry
voices
someone
had
gone
into
the
tub
and
i
hoped
it
was
linklater
i
had
taken
a
liking
to
the
fusilier
jock
there
was
the
beginning
of
a
moon
somewhere
but
that
lane
was
very
dark
i
ran
to
the
left
for
on
the
right
it
looked
like
a
this
brought
me
into
a
quiet
road
of
cottages
which
showed
at
one
end
the
lights
of
a
street
so
i
took
the
other
way
for
i
was
going
to
have
the
whole
population
of
muirtown
on
the
after
me
i
came
into
a
country
lane
and
i
also
came
into
the
van
of
the
pursuit
which
must
have
taken
a
short
cut
they
shouted
when
they
saw
me
but
i
had
a
small
start
and
legged
it
down
that
road
in
the
belief
that
i
was
making
for
open
country
that
was
where
i
was
wrong
the
road
took
me
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
town
and
just
when
i
was
beginning
to
think
i
had
a
fair
chance
i
saw
before
me
the
lights
of
a
and
a
little
to
the
left
of
it
the
lights
of
the
station
in
half
an
hour
time
the
edinburgh
train
would
be
leaving
but
i
had
made
that
impossible
behind
me
i
could
hear
the
pursuers
giving
tongue
like
hound
puppies
for
they
had
attracted
some
pretty
drunken
gentlemen
to
their
party
i
was
badly
puzzled
where
to
turn
when
i
noticed
outside
the
station
a
long
line
of
blurred
lights
which
could
only
mean
a
train
with
the
carriage
blinds
down
it
had
an
engine
attached
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
the
addition
of
a
couple
of
trucks
to
start
it
was
a
wild
chance
but
the
only
one
i
saw
i
scrambled
across
a
piece
of
waste
ground
climbed
an
embankment
and
found
myself
on
the
metals
i
ducked
under
the
couplings
and
got
on
the
far
side
of
the
train
away
from
the
enemy
then
simultaneously
two
things
happened
i
heard
the
yells
of
my
pursuers
a
dozen
yards
off
and
the
train
jolted
into
motion
i
jumped
on
the
footboard
and
looked
into
an
open
window
the
compartment
was
packed
with
troops
six
a
side
and
two
men
sitting
on
the
floor
and
the
door
was
locked
i
dived
headforemost
through
the
window
and
landed
on
the
neck
of
a
weary
warrior
who
had
just
dropped
off
to
sleep
while
i
was
falling
i
made
up
my
mind
on
my
conduct
i
must
be
intoxicated
for
i
knew
the
infinite
sympathy
of
the
british
soldier
towards
those
thus
overtaken
they
pulled
me
to
my
feet
and
the
man
i
had
descended
on
rubbed
his
skull
and
blasphemously
demanded
explanations
i
hiccoughed
i
was
late
for
this
train
and
i
mus
be
in
or
i
get
the
sack
i
if
i
hurt
my
friend
head
i
kiss
it
and
make
it
well
at
this
there
was
a
great
laugh
better
accept
pete
said
one
the
first
time
anybody
ever
offered
to
kiss
your
ugly
heid
a
man
asked
me
who
i
was
and
i
appeared
to
be
searching
for
a
i
groaned
and
so
my
wee
bag
and
i
bashed
my
hat
i
an
awful
sight
an
awful
warning
to
be
in
time
for
trains
i
john
johnstone
managing
clerk
to
messrs
watters
brown
street
i
been
up
north
my
mamma
should
be
in
france
said
one
man
i
was
but
they
would
let
me
mr
johnstone
they
said
ye
no
dam
good
ye
varicose
veins
and
a
bad
heart
they
said
so
i
says
good
mornin
do
blame
me
if
the
that
what
i
said
i
had
by
this
time
occupied
the
only
remaining
space
left
on
the
floor
with
the
philosophy
of
their
race
the
men
had
accepted
my
presence
and
were
turning
again
to
their
own
talk
the
train
had
got
up
speed
and
as
i
judged
it
to
be
a
special
of
some
kind
i
looked
for
few
stoppings
moreover
it
was
not
a
corridor
carriage
but
one
of
the
kind
so
i
was
safe
for
a
time
from
the
unwelcome
attention
of
conductors
i
stretched
my
legs
below
the
seat
rested
my
head
against
the
knees
of
a
brawny
gunner
and
settled
down
to
make
the
best
of
it
my
reflections
were
not
pleasant
i
had
got
down
too
far
below
the
surface
and
had
the
naked
feeling
you
get
in
a
dream
when
you
think
you
have
gone
to
the
theatre
in
your
nightgown
i
had
had
three
names
in
two
days
and
as
many
characters
i
felt
as
if
i
had
no
home
or
position
anywhere
and
was
only
a
stray
dog
with
everybody
hand
and
foot
against
me
it
was
an
ugly
sensation
and
it
was
not
redeemed
by
any
acute
fear
or
any
knowledge
of
being
mixed
up
in
some
desperate
drama
i
knew
i
could
easily
go
on
to
edinburgh
and
when
the
police
made
trouble
as
they
would
a
wire
to
scotland
yard
would
settle
matters
in
a
couple
of
hours
there
was
a
suspicion
of
bodily
danger
to
restore
my
dignity
the
worst
that
could
happen
would
be
that
ivery
would
hear
of
my
being
befriended
by
the
authorities
and
the
part
i
had
settled
to
play
would
be
impossible
he
would
certainly
hear
i
had
the
greatest
respect
for
his
intelligence
service
yet
that
was
bad
enough
so
far
i
had
done
well
i
had
put
gresson
off
the
scent
i
had
found
out
what
bullivant
wanted
to
know
and
i
had
only
to
return
unostentatiously
to
london
to
have
won
out
on
the
game
i
told
myself
all
that
but
it
did
cheer
my
spirits
i
was
feeling
mean
and
hunted
and
very
cold
about
the
feet
but
i
have
a
tough
knuckle
of
obstinacy
in
me
which
makes
me
unwilling
to
give
up
a
thing
till
i
am
fairly
choked
off
it
the
chances
were
badly
against
me
the
scottish
police
were
actively
interested
in
my
movements
and
would
be
ready
to
welcome
me
at
my
journey
end
i
had
ruined
my
hat
and
my
clothes
as
amos
had
observed
were
not
respectable
i
had
got
rid
of
a
beard
the
night
before
but
had
cut
myself
in
the
process
and
what
with
my
face
and
tangled
hair
looked
liker
a
tinker
than
a
decent
bagman
i
thought
with
longing
of
my
portmanteau
in
the
pentland
hotel
edinburgh
and
the
neat
blue
serge
suit
and
the
clean
linen
that
reposed
in
it
it
was
no
case
for
a
subtle
game
for
i
held
no
cards
still
i
was
determined
not
to
chuck
in
my
hand
till
i
was
forced
to
if
the
train
stopped
anywhere
i
would
get
out
and
trust
to
my
own
wits
and
the
standing
luck
of
the
british
army
for
the
rest
the
chance
came
just
after
dawn
when
we
halted
at
a
little
junction
i
got
up
yawning
and
tried
to
open
the
door
till
i
remembered
it
was
locked
thereupon
i
stuck
my
legs
out
of
the
window
on
the
side
away
from
the
platform
and
was
immediately
seized
upon
by
a
sleepy
seaforth
who
thought
i
contemplated
suicide
me
go
i
said
be
back
in
a
jiffy
him
gang
jock
said
another
voice
ken
what
a
man
like
when
he
been
on
the
bash
the
cauld
air
sober
him
i
was
released
and
after
some
gymnastics
dropped
on
the
metals
and
made
my
way
round
the
rear
of
the
train
as
i
clambered
on
the
platform
it
began
to
move
and
a
face
looked
out
of
one
of
the
back
carriages
it
was
linklater
and
he
recognized
me
he
tried
to
get
out
but
the
door
was
promptly
slammed
by
an
indignant
porter
i
heard
him
protest
and
he
kept
his
head
out
till
the
train
went
round
the
curve
that
cooked
my
goose
all
right
he
would
wire
to
the
police
from
the
next
station
meantime
in
that
clean
bare
chilly
place
there
was
only
one
traveller
he
was
a
slim
young
man
with
a
and
a
his
clothes
were
beautiful
a
green
homburg
hat
a
smart
green
tweed
overcoat
and
boots
as
brightly
polished
as
a
horse
chestnut
i
caught
his
profile
as
he
gave
up
his
ticket
and
to
my
amazement
i
recognized
it
the
looked
askance
at
me
as
i
presented
myself
dilapidated
and
dishevelled
to
the
official
gaze
i
tried
to
speak
in
a
tone
of
authority
is
the
man
who
has
just
gone
out
your
ticket
had
no
time
to
get
one
at
muirtown
and
as
you
see
i
have
left
my
luggage
behind
me
take
it
out
of
that
pound
and
i
come
back
for
the
change
i
want
to
know
if
that
was
sir
archibald
roylance
he
looked
suspiciously
at
the
note
think
that
the
name
he
a
captain
up
at
the
fleein
school
what
was
ye
wantin
with
him
i
charged
through
the
and
found
my
man
about
to
enter
a
big
grey
i
cried
and
beat
him
on
the
shoulders
he
turned
round
sharply
the
devil
who
are
you
and
then
recognition
crept
into
his
face
and
he
gave
a
joyous
shout
holy
aunt
the
general
disguised
as
charlie
chaplin
can
i
drive
you
anywhere
sir
chapter
nine
i
take
the
wings
of
a
dove
me
somewhere
to
breakfast
archie
i
said
i
perishing
hungry
he
and
i
got
into
the
tonneau
and
the
driver
swung
us
out
of
the
station
road
up
a
long
incline
of
hill
sir
archie
had
been
one
of
my
subalterns
in
the
old
lennox
highlanders
and
had
left
us
before
the
somme
to
join
the
flying
corps
i
had
heard
that
he
had
got
his
wings
and
had
done
well
before
arras
and
was
now
training
pilots
at
home
he
had
been
a
youth
who
had
endured
a
good
deal
of
from
me
for
his
sins
of
omission
but
it
was
the
casual
class
of
lad
i
was
looking
for
now
i
saw
him
steal
amused
glances
at
my
appearance
seein
a
bit
of
life
sir
he
inquired
respectfully
being
hunted
by
the
police
i
said
dogs
but
do
worry
sir
we
get
you
off
all
right
been
in
the
same
fix
myself
you
can
lie
snug
in
my
little
log
hut
for
that
old
image
gibbons
wo
blab
or
tell
you
what
i
got
an
aunt
who
lives
near
here
and
she
a
bit
of
a
sportsman
you
can
hide
in
her
moated
grange
till
the
bobbies
get
tired
i
think
it
was
archie
calm
acceptance
of
my
position
as
natural
and
becoming
that
restored
my
good
temper
he
was
far
too
well
bred
to
ask
what
crime
i
had
committed
and
i
did
propose
to
enlighten
him
much
but
as
we
swung
up
the
moorland
road
i
let
him
know
that
i
was
serving
the
government
but
that
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
appear
to
be
unauthenticated
and
that
therefore
i
must
dodge
the
police
he
whistled
his
appreciation
that
a
deep
game
sort
of
camouflage
speaking
from
my
experience
it
is
easy
to
overdo
that
kind
of
stunt
when
i
was
at
misieux
the
french
started
out
to
camouflage
the
caravans
where
they
keep
their
pigeons
and
they
did
it
so
damned
well
that
the
poor
little
birds
could
hit
off
and
spent
the
night
out
we
entered
the
white
gates
of
a
big
aerodrome
skirted
a
forest
of
tents
and
huts
and
drew
up
at
a
shanty
on
the
far
confines
of
the
place
the
hour
was
half
past
four
and
the
world
was
still
asleep
archie
nodded
towards
one
of
the
hangars
from
the
mouth
of
which
projected
the
propeller
end
of
an
aeroplane
by
way
of
flyin
that
bus
down
to
farnton
tomorrow
he
remarked
the
new
got
a
mouth
like
a
tree
an
idea
flashed
into
my
mind
going
this
morning
i
said
did
you
know
he
exclaimed
due
to
go
today
but
the
grouse
up
in
caithness
wanted
shootin
so
badly
that
i
decided
to
wangle
another
day
leave
they
ca
expect
a
man
to
start
for
the
south
of
england
when
he
just
off
a
frowsy
journey
the
same
you
going
to
be
a
stout
fellow
and
start
in
two
time
and
you
going
to
take
me
with
you
he
stared
blankly
and
then
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
the
man
to
go
with
but
what
price
my
commandant
he
not
a
bad
chap
but
a
trifle
shaggy
about
the
fetlocks
he
wo
appreciate
the
joke
need
know
he
must
know
this
is
an
affair
between
you
and
me
till
it
finished
i
promise
you
i
make
it
all
square
with
the
flying
corps
get
me
down
to
farnton
before
evening
and
you
have
done
a
good
piece
of
work
for
the
country
let
have
a
tub
and
a
bit
of
breakfast
and
then
i
your
man
i
tell
them
to
get
the
bus
ready
in
archie
bedroom
i
washed
and
shaved
and
borrowed
a
green
tweed
cap
and
a
aquascutum
the
latter
covered
the
deficiencies
of
my
raiment
and
when
i
commandeered
a
pair
of
gloves
i
felt
almost
respectable
gibbons
who
seemed
to
be
a
cooked
us
some
bacon
and
an
omelette
and
as
he
ate
archie
yarned
in
the
battalion
his
conversation
had
been
mostly
of
and
the
forsaken
delights
of
town
but
now
he
had
forgotten
all
that
and
like
every
good
airman
i
have
ever
known
wallowed
enthusiastically
in
i
have
a
deep
respect
for
the
flying
corps
but
it
is
apt
to
change
its
jargon
every
month
and
its
conversation
is
hard
for
the
layman
to
follow
he
was
desperately
keen
about
the
war
which
he
saw
wholly
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
air
arras
to
him
was
over
before
the
infantry
crossed
the
top
and
the
tough
bit
of
the
somme
was
october
not
september
he
calculated
that
the
big
had
not
come
along
yet
and
all
he
hoped
for
was
to
be
allowed
out
to
france
to
have
his
share
in
it
like
all
good
airmen
too
he
was
very
modest
about
himself
done
a
bit
of
and
huntin
and
i
good
hands
for
a
horse
so
i
can
handle
a
bus
fairly
well
it
all
a
matter
of
hands
you
know
there
ai
half
the
risk
of
the
infantry
down
below
you
and
a
million
times
the
fun
jolly
glad
i
changed
sir
we
talked
of
peter
and
he
put
him
about
top
voss
he
thought
was
the
only
boche
that
could
compare
with
him
for
he
had
made
up
his
mind
about
lensch
the
frenchman
guynemer
he
ranked
high
but
in
a
different
way
i
remember
he
had
no
respect
for
richthofen
and
his
celebrated
circus
at
six
sharp
we
were
ready
to
go
a
couple
of
mechanics
had
got
out
the
machine
and
archie
put
on
his
coat
and
gloves
and
climbed
into
the
pilot
seat
while
i
squeezed
in
behind
in
the
observer
place
the
aerodrome
was
waking
up
but
i
saw
no
officers
about
we
were
scarcely
seated
when
gibbons
called
our
attention
to
a
on
the
road
and
presently
we
heard
a
shout
and
saw
men
waving
in
our
direction
get
off
my
lad
i
said
look
like
my
friends
the
engine
started
and
the
mechanics
stood
clear
as
we
taxied
over
the
turf
i
looked
back
and
saw
several
figures
running
in
our
direction
the
next
second
we
had
left
the
bumpy
earth
for
the
smooth
highroad
of
the
air
i
had
flown
several
dozen
times
before
generally
over
the
enemy
lines
when
i
wanted
to
see
for
myself
how
the
land
lay
then
we
had
flown
low
and
been
nicely
dusted
by
the
hun
archies
not
to
speak
of
an
occasional
but
never
till
that
hour
had
i
realized
the
joy
of
a
straight
flight
in
a
swift
plane
in
perfect
weather
archie
lose
time
soon
the
hangars
behind
looked
like
a
child
toys
and
the
world
ran
away
from
us
till
it
seemed
like
a
great
golden
bowl
spilling
over
with
the
quintessence
of
light
the
air
was
cold
and
my
hands
numbed
but
i
never
felt
them
as
we
throbbed
and
tore
southward
sometimes
bumping
in
eddies
sometimes
swimming
evenly
in
a
stream
of
motionless
ether
my
head
and
heart
grew
as
light
as
a
boy
i
forgot
all
about
the
vexations
of
my
job
and
saw
only
its
joyful
comedy
i
did
think
that
anything
on
earth
could
worry
me
again
far
to
the
left
was
a
wedge
of
silver
and
beside
it
a
cluster
of
toy
houses
that
must
be
edinburgh
where
reposed
my
portmanteau
and
where
a
most
efficient
police
force
was
now
inquiring
for
me
at
the
thought
i
laughed
so
loud
that
archie
must
have
heard
me
he
turned
round
saw
my
grinning
face
and
grinned
back
then
he
signalled
to
me
to
strap
myself
in
i
obeyed
and
he
proceeded
to
practise
the
loop
the
spinning
and
others
i
did
know
the
names
of
it
was
glorious
fun
and
he
handled
his
machine
as
a
good
rider
coaxes
a
nervous
horse
over
a
stiff
hurdle
he
had
that
extra
something
in
his
blood
that
makes
the
great
pilot
presently
the
chessboard
of
green
and
brown
had
changed
to
a
deep
purple
with
faint
silvery
lines
like
veins
in
a
rock
we
were
crossing
the
border
hills
the
place
where
i
had
legged
it
for
weary
days
when
i
was
mixed
up
in
the
black
stone
business
what
a
marvellous
element
was
this
air
which
took
one
far
above
the
fatigues
of
humanity
archie
had
done
well
to
change
peter
had
been
the
wise
man
i
felt
a
tremendous
pity
for
my
old
friend
hobbling
about
a
german
when
he
had
once
flown
a
hawk
i
reflected
that
i
had
wasted
my
life
hitherto
and
then
i
remembered
that
all
this
glory
had
only
one
use
in
war
and
that
was
to
help
the
muddy
british
infantryman
to
down
his
hun
opponent
he
was
the
fellow
after
all
that
decided
battles
and
the
thought
comforted
me
a
great
exhilaration
is
often
the
precursor
of
disaster
and
mine
was
to
have
a
sudden
downfall
it
was
getting
on
for
noon
and
we
were
well
into
england
i
guessed
from
the
rivers
we
had
passed
that
we
were
somewhere
in
the
north
of
yorkshire
when
the
machine
began
to
make
odd
sounds
and
we
bumped
in
perfectly
calm
patches
of
air
we
dived
and
then
climbed
but
the
confounded
thing
kept
sputtering
archie
passed
back
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
he
had
scribbled
conked
must
land
at
micklegill
very
sorry
so
we
dropped
to
a
lower
elevation
where
we
could
see
clearly
the
houses
and
roads
and
the
long
swelling
ridges
of
a
moorland
country
i
could
never
have
found
my
way
about
but
archie
practised
eye
knew
every
landmark
we
were
trundling
along
very
slowly
now
and
even
i
was
soon
able
to
pick
up
the
hangars
of
a
big
aerodrome
we
made
micklegill
but
only
by
the
skin
of
our
teeth
we
were
so
low
that
the
smoky
chimneys
of
the
city
of
bradfield
seven
miles
to
the
east
were
half
hidden
by
a
ridge
of
down
archie
achieved
a
clever
descent
in
the
lee
of
a
belt
of
firs
and
got
out
full
of
imprecations
against
the
gladas
engine
go
up
to
the
camp
and
report
he
said
send
mechanics
down
to
tinker
this
darned
gramophone
better
go
for
a
walk
sir
i
do
want
to
answer
questions
about
you
till
we
ready
to
start
i
reckon
it
be
an
hour
job
the
cheerfulness
i
had
acquired
in
the
upper
air
still
filled
me
i
sat
down
in
a
ditch
as
merry
as
a
and
lit
a
pipe
i
was
possessed
by
a
boyish
spirit
of
casual
adventure
and
waited
on
the
next
turn
of
fortune
wheel
with
only
a
pleasant
amusement
that
turn
was
not
long
in
coming
archie
appeared
very
breathless
here
sir
there
the
deuce
of
a
row
up
there
they
been
wirin
about
you
all
over
the
country
and
they
know
you
with
me
they
got
the
police
and
they
have
you
in
five
minutes
if
you
do
leg
it
i
lied
like
and
said
i
had
never
heard
of
you
but
they
comin
to
see
for
themselves
for
god
sake
get
off
you
better
keep
in
cover
down
that
hollow
and
round
the
back
of
these
trees
i
stay
here
and
try
to
brazen
it
out
i
get
strafed
to
blazes
anyhow
i
hope
you
get
me
out
of
the
scrape
sir
you
worry
my
lad
i
said
make
it
all
square
when
i
get
back
to
town
i
make
for
bradfield
for
this
place
is
a
bit
conspicuous
goodbye
archie
you
a
good
chap
and
i
see
you
suffer
i
started
off
down
the
hollow
of
the
moor
trying
to
make
speed
atone
for
lack
of
strategy
for
it
was
hard
to
know
how
much
my
pursuers
commanded
from
that
higher
ground
they
must
have
seen
me
for
i
heard
whistles
blown
and
men
cries
i
struck
a
road
crossed
it
and
passed
a
ridge
from
which
i
had
a
view
of
bradfield
six
miles
off
and
as
i
ran
i
began
to
reflect
that
this
kind
of
chase
could
not
last
long
they
were
bound
to
round
me
up
in
the
next
unless
i
could
puzzle
them
but
in
that
bare
green
place
there
was
no
cover
and
it
looked
as
if
my
chances
were
pretty
much
those
of
a
hare
coursed
by
a
good
greyhound
on
a
naked
moor
suddenly
from
just
in
front
of
me
came
a
familiar
sound
it
was
the
roar
of
guns
the
slam
of
and
the
boom
of
small
howitzers
i
wondered
if
i
had
gone
off
my
head
as
i
plodded
on
the
rattle
of
was
added
and
over
the
ridge
before
me
i
saw
the
dust
and
fumes
of
bursting
shells
i
concluded
that
i
was
not
mad
and
that
therefore
the
germans
must
have
landed
i
crawled
up
the
last
slope
quite
forgetting
the
pursuit
behind
me
and
then
i
blessed
if
i
did
not
look
down
on
a
veritable
battle
there
were
two
sets
of
trenches
with
barbed
wire
and
all
the
fixings
one
set
filled
with
troops
and
the
other
empty
on
these
latter
shells
were
bursting
but
there
was
no
sign
of
life
in
them
in
the
other
lines
there
seemed
the
better
part
of
two
brigades
and
the
first
trench
was
stiff
with
bayonets
my
first
thought
was
that
home
forces
had
gone
dotty
for
this
kind
of
show
could
have
no
sort
of
training
value
and
then
i
saw
other
things
cameras
and
on
platforms
on
the
flanks
and
men
with
megaphones
behind
them
on
wooden
scaffoldings
one
of
the
megaphones
was
going
full
blast
all
the
time
i
saw
the
meaning
of
the
performance
at
last
some
had
got
a
graft
with
the
government
and
troops
had
been
turned
out
to
make
a
war
film
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
were
mixed
up
in
that
push
i
might
get
the
cover
i
was
looking
for
i
scurried
down
the
hill
to
the
nearest
as
i
ran
the
first
wave
of
troops
went
over
the
top
they
did
it
uncommon
well
for
they
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
and
went
over
with
grim
faces
and
that
slow
purposeful
lope
that
i
had
seen
in
my
own
fellows
at
arras
smoke
grenades
burst
among
them
and
now
and
then
some
resourceful
mountebank
would
roll
over
altogether
it
was
about
the
best
show
i
have
ever
seen
the
cameras
clicked
the
guns
banged
a
background
of
boy
scouts
applauded
and
the
dust
rose
in
billows
to
the
sky
but
all
the
same
something
was
wrong
i
could
imagine
that
this
kind
of
business
took
a
good
deal
of
planning
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
for
his
purpose
was
not
the
same
as
that
of
the
officer
in
command
you
know
how
a
photographer
finicks
about
and
is
dissatisfied
with
a
pose
that
seems
all
right
to
his
sitter
i
should
have
thought
the
spectacle
enough
to
get
any
cinema
audience
off
their
feet
but
the
man
on
the
scaffolding
near
me
judged
differently
he
made
his
megaphone
boom
like
the
of
a
dying
buffalo
he
wanted
to
change
something
and
did
know
how
to
do
it
he
hopped
on
one
leg
he
took
the
megaphone
from
his
mouth
to
curse
he
waved
it
like
a
banner
and
yelled
at
some
opposite
number
on
the
other
flank
and
then
his
patience
forsook
him
and
he
skipped
down
the
ladder
dropping
his
megaphone
past
the
on
to
the
battlefield
that
was
his
undoing
he
got
in
the
way
of
the
second
wave
and
was
swallowed
up
like
a
leaf
in
a
torrent
for
a
moment
i
saw
a
red
face
and
a
suit
and
the
rest
was
silence
he
was
carried
on
over
the
hill
or
rolled
into
an
enemy
trench
but
anyhow
he
was
lost
to
my
ken
i
bagged
his
megaphone
and
hopped
up
the
steps
to
the
platform
at
last
i
saw
a
chance
of
cover
for
with
archie
coat
and
cap
i
made
a
very
good
appearance
as
a
two
waves
had
gone
over
the
top
and
the
working
like
beavers
had
filmed
the
lot
but
there
was
still
a
fair
amount
of
troops
to
play
with
and
i
determined
to
tangle
up
that
outfit
so
that
the
fellows
who
were
after
me
would
have
better
things
to
think
about
my
advantage
was
that
i
knew
how
to
command
men
i
could
see
that
my
opposite
number
with
the
megaphone
was
helpless
for
the
mistake
which
had
swept
my
man
into
a
had
reduced
him
to
impotence
the
troops
seemed
to
be
mainly
in
charge
of
i
could
imagine
that
the
officers
would
try
to
shirk
this
business
and
an
is
the
most
literal
creature
on
earth
so
with
my
megaphone
i
proceeded
to
change
the
battle
order
i
brought
up
the
third
wave
to
the
front
trenches
in
about
three
minutes
the
men
had
recognized
the
professional
touch
and
were
moving
smartly
to
my
orders
they
thought
it
was
part
of
the
show
and
the
obedient
cameras
clicked
at
everything
that
came
into
their
orbit
my
aim
was
to
deploy
the
troops
on
too
narrow
a
front
so
that
they
were
bound
to
fan
outward
and
i
had
to
be
quick
about
it
for
i
did
know
when
the
hapless
might
be
retrieved
from
the
and
dispute
my
authority
it
takes
a
long
time
to
straighten
a
thing
out
but
it
does
not
take
long
to
tangle
it
especially
when
the
thing
is
so
delicate
a
machine
as
disciplined
troops
in
about
eight
minutes
i
had
produced
chaos
the
flanks
spread
out
in
spite
of
all
the
shepherding
of
the
and
the
fringe
engulfed
the
photographers
the
cameras
on
their
little
platforms
went
down
like
ninepins
it
was
solemn
to
see
the
startled
face
of
a
photographer
taken
unawares
supplicating
the
purposeful
infantry
before
he
was
swept
off
his
feet
into
speechlessness
it
was
no
place
for
me
to
linger
in
so
i
chucked
away
the
megaphone
and
got
mixed
up
with
the
tail
of
the
third
wave
i
was
swept
on
and
came
to
anchor
in
the
enemy
trenches
where
i
found
as
i
expected
my
profane
and
breathless
predecessor
the
i
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
so
i
stuck
to
the
trench
till
it
ended
against
the
slope
of
the
hill
on
that
flank
delirious
with
excitement
stood
a
knot
of
boy
scouts
my
business
was
to
get
to
bradfield
as
quick
as
my
legs
would
take
me
and
as
inconspicuously
as
the
gods
would
permit
unhappily
i
was
far
too
great
an
object
of
interest
to
that
nursery
of
heroes
every
boy
scout
is
an
amateur
detective
and
hungry
for
knowledge
i
was
followed
by
several
who
plied
me
with
questions
and
were
told
that
i
was
off
to
bradfield
to
hurry
up
part
of
the
cinema
outfit
it
sounded
lame
enough
for
that
cinema
outfit
was
already
past
praying
for
we
reached
the
road
and
against
a
stone
wall
stood
several
bicycles
i
selected
one
and
prepared
to
mount
mr
emmott
machine
said
one
boy
sharply
told
me
to
keep
an
eye
on
it
must
borrow
it
sonny
i
said
emmott
my
very
good
friend
and
wo
object
from
the
place
where
we
stood
i
overlooked
the
back
of
the
and
could
see
an
anxious
congress
of
officers
i
could
see
others
too
whose
appearance
i
did
not
like
they
had
not
been
there
when
i
operated
on
the
megaphone
they
must
have
come
downhill
from
the
aerodrome
and
in
all
likelihood
were
the
pursuers
i
had
avoided
the
exhilaration
which
i
had
won
in
the
air
and
which
had
carried
me
into
the
tomfoolery
of
the
past
was
ebbing
i
had
the
hunted
feeling
once
more
and
grew
and
cautious
i
had
a
baddish
record
for
the
day
what
with
getting
archie
into
a
scrape
and
busting
up
an
official
cinema
show
neither
consistent
with
the
duties
of
a
besides
i
had
still
to
get
to
london
i
had
not
gone
two
hundred
yards
down
the
road
when
a
boy
scout
pedalling
furiously
came
up
abreast
me
edgeworth
wants
to
see
you
he
panted
to
come
back
at
once
him
i
ca
wait
now
i
said
pay
my
respects
to
him
in
an
hour
said
you
were
to
come
at
once
said
the
faithful
messenger
in
an
awful
temper
with
you
and
he
got
bobbies
with
him
i
put
on
pace
and
left
the
boy
behind
i
reckoned
i
had
the
better
part
of
two
miles
start
and
could
beat
anything
except
petrol
but
my
enemies
were
bound
to
have
cars
so
i
had
better
get
off
the
road
as
soon
as
possible
i
coasted
down
a
long
hill
to
a
bridge
which
spanned
a
small
discoloured
stream
that
flowed
in
a
wooded
glen
there
was
nobody
for
the
moment
on
the
hill
behind
me
so
i
slipped
into
the
covert
shoved
the
bicycle
under
the
bridge
and
hid
aquascutum
in
a
bramble
thicket
i
was
now
in
my
own
disreputable
tweeds
and
i
hoped
that
the
shedding
of
my
most
conspicuous
garment
would
puzzle
my
pursuers
if
they
should
catch
up
with
me
but
this
i
was
determined
they
should
not
do
i
made
good
going
down
that
stream
and
out
into
a
lane
which
led
from
the
downs
to
the
round
the
city
i
thanked
heaven
i
had
got
rid
of
the
aquascutum
for
the
august
afternoon
was
warm
and
my
pace
was
not
leisurely
when
i
was
in
secluded
ground
i
ran
and
when
anyone
was
in
sight
i
walked
smartly
as
i
went
i
reflected
that
bradfield
would
see
the
end
of
my
adventures
the
police
knew
that
i
was
there
and
would
watch
the
stations
and
hunt
me
down
if
i
lingered
in
the
place
i
knew
no
one
there
and
had
no
chance
of
getting
an
effective
disguise
indeed
i
very
soon
began
to
wonder
if
i
should
get
even
as
far
as
the
streets
for
at
the
moment
when
i
had
got
a
lift
on
the
back
of
a
fishmonger
cart
and
was
screened
by
its
flapping
canvas
two
figures
passed
on
and
one
of
them
was
the
inquisitive
boy
scout
the
main
road
from
the
aerodrome
was
probably
now
being
patrolled
by
it
looked
as
if
there
would
be
a
degrading
arrest
in
one
of
the
suburbs
the
helped
by
half
a
crown
to
the
driver
took
me
past
the
outlying
between
long
lines
of
workmen
houses
to
narrow
cobbled
lanes
and
the
purlieus
of
great
factories
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
streets
well
crowded
i
got
out
and
walked
in
my
old
clothes
i
must
have
appeared
like
some
bookie
or
seedy
the
only
respectable
thing
i
had
about
me
was
my
gold
watch
i
looked
at
the
time
and
found
it
half
past
five
i
wanted
food
and
was
casting
about
for
an
when
i
heard
the
purr
of
a
and
across
the
road
saw
the
intelligent
boy
scout
he
saw
me
too
and
put
on
the
brake
with
a
sharpness
which
caused
him
to
skid
and
all
but
come
to
grief
under
the
wheels
of
a
that
gave
me
time
to
efface
myself
by
darting
up
a
side
street
i
had
an
unpleasant
sense
that
i
was
about
to
be
trapped
for
in
a
place
i
knew
nothing
of
i
had
not
a
chance
to
use
my
wits
i
remember
trying
feverishly
to
think
and
i
suppose
that
my
preoccupation
made
me
careless
i
was
now
in
a
veritable
slum
and
when
i
put
my
hand
to
my
vest
pocket
i
found
that
my
watch
had
gone
that
put
the
top
stone
on
my
depression
the
reaction
from
the
wild
burnout
of
the
forenoon
had
left
me
very
cold
about
the
feet
i
was
getting
into
the
again
and
there
was
no
chance
of
a
second
archie
roylance
turning
up
to
rescue
me
i
remember
yet
the
sour
smell
of
the
factories
and
the
mist
of
smoke
in
the
evening
air
it
is
a
smell
i
have
never
met
since
without
a
sort
of
dulling
of
spirit
presently
i
came
out
into
a
whistles
were
blowing
and
there
was
a
great
hurrying
of
people
back
from
the
mills
the
crowd
gave
me
a
momentary
sense
of
security
and
i
was
just
about
to
inquire
my
way
to
the
railway
station
when
someone
jostled
my
arm
a
fellow
in
mechanic
clothes
was
beside
me
he
whispered
got
summat
o
yours
here
and
to
my
amazement
he
slipped
my
watch
into
my
hand
was
took
by
mistake
we
friends
o
yours
you
right
enough
if
you
do
what
i
tell
you
there
a
peeler
over
there
got
his
eye
on
you
follow
me
and
i
get
you
off
i
did
much
like
the
man
looks
but
i
had
no
choice
and
anyhow
he
had
given
me
back
my
watch
he
sidled
into
an
alley
between
tall
houses
and
i
sidled
after
him
then
he
took
to
his
heels
and
led
me
a
twisting
course
through
smelly
courts
into
a
tanyard
and
then
by
a
narrow
lane
to
the
of
a
factory
twice
we
doubled
back
and
once
we
climbed
a
wall
and
followed
the
bank
of
a
stream
with
a
filthy
scum
on
it
then
we
got
into
a
very
mean
quarter
of
the
town
and
emerged
in
a
dingy
garden
strewn
with
tin
cans
and
broken
flowerpots
by
a
back
door
we
entered
one
of
the
cottages
and
my
guide
very
carefully
locked
it
behind
him
he
lit
the
gas
and
drew
the
blinds
in
a
small
parlour
and
looked
at
me
long
and
quizzically
he
spoke
now
in
an
educated
voice
ask
no
questions
he
said
it
my
business
to
put
my
services
at
your
disposal
you
carry
the
passport
i
stared
at
him
and
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
showed
a
cross
inside
the
lid
do
defend
all
the
people
we
employ
he
said
grinning
morals
are
not
always
as
good
as
their
patriotism
one
of
them
pinched
your
watch
and
when
he
saw
what
was
inside
it
he
reported
to
me
we
soon
picked
up
your
trail
and
observed
you
were
in
a
bit
of
trouble
as
i
say
i
ask
no
questions
what
can
we
do
for
you
want
to
get
to
london
without
any
questions
asked
they
looking
for
me
in
my
present
rig
so
i
got
to
change
it
easy
enough
he
said
yourself
comfortable
for
a
little
and
i
fix
you
up
the
night
train
goes
at
find
cigars
in
the
cupboard
and
there
this
week
on
that
table
it
got
a
good
article
on
conrad
if
you
care
for
such
things
i
helped
myself
to
a
cigar
and
spent
a
profitable
reading
about
the
vices
of
the
british
government
then
my
host
returned
and
bade
me
ascend
to
his
bedroom
private
henry
tomkins
of
the
gloucesters
and
you
find
your
clothes
ready
for
you
i
send
on
your
present
togs
if
you
give
me
an
address
i
did
as
i
was
bid
and
presently
emerged
in
the
uniform
of
a
british
private
complete
down
to
the
shapeless
boots
and
the
dropsical
puttees
then
my
friend
took
me
in
hand
and
finished
the
transformation
he
started
on
my
hair
with
scissors
and
arranged
a
lock
which
when
well
oiled
curled
over
my
forehead
my
hands
were
hard
and
rough
and
only
needed
some
grubbiness
and
hacking
about
the
nails
to
pass
muster
with
my
cap
on
the
side
of
my
head
a
pack
on
my
back
a
service
rifle
in
my
hands
and
my
pockets
bursting
with
penny
picture
papers
i
was
the
very
model
of
the
british
soldier
returning
from
leave
i
had
also
a
packet
of
woodbine
cigarettes
and
a
hunch
of
for
the
journey
and
i
had
a
railway
warrant
made
out
in
my
name
for
london
then
my
friend
gave
me
supper
bread
and
cold
meat
and
a
bottle
of
bass
which
i
wolfed
savagely
for
i
had
had
nothing
since
breakfast
he
was
a
curious
fellow
as
discreet
as
a
tombstone
very
ready
to
speak
about
general
subjects
but
never
once
coming
near
the
intimate
business
which
had
linked
him
and
me
and
heaven
knew
how
many
others
by
means
of
a
little
cross
in
a
i
remember
we
talked
about
the
topics
that
used
to
be
popular
at
biggleswick
the
big
political
things
that
begin
with
capital
letters
he
took
amos
view
of
the
soundness
of
the
british
but
he
said
something
which
made
me
think
he
was
convinced
that
there
was
a
tremendous
lot
of

private

you
out
of
bradfield
but
it
might
be
a
healthy
alias
in
the
metropolis
at
i
was
safe
in
the
train
talking
the
jargon
of
the
returning
soldier
with
half
a
dozen
of
my
own
type
in
a
smoky
carriage
i
had
been
lucky
in
my
escape
for
at
the
station
entrance
and
on
the
platform
i
had
noticed
several
men
with
the
unmistakable
look
of
plainclothes
police
also
though
this
may
have
been
my
fancy
i
thought
i
caught
in
the
crowd
a
glimpse
of
the
bagman
who
had
called
himself
linklater
chapter
ten
the
advantages
of
an
air
raid
the
train
was
abominably
late
it
was
due
at
but
it
was
nearly
ten
when
we
reached
st
pancras
i
had
resolved
to
go
straight
to
my
rooms
in
westminster
buying
on
the
way
a
cap
and
waterproof
to
conceal
my
uniform
should
anyone
be
near
my
door
on
my
arrival
then
i
would
ring
up
blenkiron
and
tell
him
all
my
adventures
i
breakfasted
at
a
left
my
pack
and
rifle
in
the
and
walked
out
into
the
clear
sunny
morning
i
was
feeling
very
pleased
with
myself
looking
back
on
my
madcap
journey
i
seemed
to
have
had
an
amazing
run
of
luck
and
to
be
entitled
to
a
little
credit
too
i
told
myself
that
persistence
always
pays
and
that
nobody
is
beaten
till
he
is
dead
all
blenkiron
instructions
had
been
faithfully
carried
out
i
had
found
ivery
post
office
i
had
laid
the
lines
of
our
own
special
communications
with
the
enemy
and
so
far
as
i
could
see
i
had
left
no
clue
behind
me
ivery
and
gresson
took
me
for
a
nincompoop
it
was
true
that
i
had
aroused
profound
suspicion
in
the
breasts
of
the
scottish
police
but
that
mattered
nothing
for
cornelius
brand
the
suspect
would
presently
disappear
and
there
was
nothing
against
that
rising
soldier
richard
hannay
who
would
soon
be
on
his
way
to
france
after
all
this
piece
of
service
had
not
been
so
very
unpleasant
i
laughed
when
i
remembered
my
grim
forebodings
in
gloucestershire
bullivant
had
said
it
would
be
damnably
risky
in
the
long
run
but
here
was
the
end
and
i
had
never
been
in
danger
of
anything
worse
than
making
a
fool
of
myself
i
remember
that
as
i
made
my
way
through
bloomsbury
i
was
not
thinking
so
much
of
my
triumphant
report
to
blenkiron
as
of
my
speedy
return
to
the
front
soon
i
would
be
with
my
beloved
brigade
again
i
had
missed
messines
and
the
first
part
of
third
ypres
but
the
battle
was
still
going
on
and
i
had
yet
a
chance
i
might
get
a
division
for
there
had
been
talk
of
that
before
i
left
i
knew
the
army
commander
thought
a
lot
of
me
but
on
the
whole
i
hoped
i
would
be
left
with
the
brigade
after
all
i
was
an
amateur
soldier
and
i
was
certain
of
my
powers
with
a
bigger
command
in
charing
cross
road
i
thought
of
mary
and
the
brigade
seemed
suddenly
less
attractive
i
hoped
the
war
would
last
much
longer
though
with
russia
heading
straight
for
the
devil
i
did
know
how
it
was
going
to
stop
very
soon
i
was
determined
to
see
mary
before
i
left
and
i
had
a
good
excuse
for
i
had
taken
my
orders
from
her
the
prospect
entranced
me
and
i
was
mooning
along
in
a
happy
dream
when
i
collided
violently
with
in
agitated
citizen
then
i
realized
that
something
very
odd
was
happening
there
was
a
dull
sound
like
the
popping
of
the
corks
of
flat
bottles
there
was
a
humming
too
from
very
far
up
in
the
skies
people
in
the
street
were
either
staring
at
the
heavens
or
running
wildly
for
shelter
a
in
front
of
me
emptied
its
contents
in
a
twinkling
a
taxi
pulled
up
with
a
jar
and
the
driver
and
fare
dived
into
a
bookshop
it
took
me
a
moment
or
two
to
realize
the
meaning
of
it
all
and
i
had
scarcely
done
this
when
i
got
a
very
practical
proof
a
hundred
yards
away
a
bomb
fell
on
a
street
island
shivering
every
in
a
wide
radius
and
sending
splinters
of
stone
flying
about
my
head
i
did
what
i
had
done
a
hundred
times
before
at
the
front
and
dropped
flat
on
my
face
the
man
who
says
he
does
mind
being
bombed
or
shelled
is
either
a
liar
or
a
maniac
this
london
air
raid
seemed
to
me
a
singularly
unpleasant
business
i
think
it
was
the
sight
of
the
decent
civilized
life
around
one
and
the
orderly
streets
for
what
was
perfectly
natural
in
a
like
ypres
or
arras
seemed
an
outrage
here
i
remember
once
being
in
billets
in
a
flanders
village
where
i
had
the
house
and
sat
in
a
room
upholstered
in
cut
velvet
with
wax
flowers
on
the
mantelpiece
and
oil
paintings
of
three
generations
on
the
walls
the
boche
took
it
into
his
head
to
shell
the
place
with
a
naval
gun
and
i
simply
loathed
it
it
was
horrible
to
have
dust
and
splinters
blown
into
that
snug
homely
room
whereas
if
i
had
been
in
a
ruined
barn
i
would
have
given
the
thing
two
thoughts
in
the
same
way
bombs
dropping
in
central
london
seemed
a
grotesque
indecency
i
hated
to
see
plump
citizens
with
wild
eyes
and
nursemaids
with
scared
children
and
miserable
women
scuttling
like
rabbits
in
a
warren
the
drone
grew
louder
and
looking
up
i
could
see
the
enemy
planes
flying
in
a
beautiful
formation
very
leisurely
as
it
seemed
with
all
london
at
their
mercy
another
bomb
fell
to
the
right
and
presently
bits
of
our
own
shrapnel
were
clattering
viciously
around
me
i
thought
it
about
time
to
take
cover
and
ran
shamelessly
for
the
best
place
i
could
see
which
was
a
tube
station
five
minutes
before
the
street
had
been
crowded
now
i
left
behind
me
a
desert
dotted
with
one
bus
and
three
empty
taxicabs
i
found
the
tube
entrance
filled
with
excited
humanity
one
stout
lady
had
fainted
and
a
nurse
had
become
hysterical
but
on
the
whole
people
were
behaving
well
oddly
enough
they
did
not
seem
inclined
to
go
down
the
stairs
to
the
complete
security
of
underground
but
preferred
rather
to
collect
where
they
could
still
get
a
glimpse
of
the
upper
world
as
if
they
were
torn
between
fear
of
their
lives
and
interest
in
the
spectacle
that
crowd
gave
me
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
my
countrymen
but
several
were
badly
rattled
and
one
man
a
little
way
off
whose
back
was
turned
kept
twitching
his
shoulders
as
if
he
had
the
colic
i
watched
him
curiously
and
a
movement
of
the
crowd
brought
his
face
into
profile
then
i
gasped
with
amazement
for
i
saw
that
it
was
ivery
and
yet
it
was
not
ivery
there
were
the
familiar
nondescript
features
the
blandness
the
plumpness
but
all
so
to
speak
in
ruins
the
man
was
in
a
blind
funk
his
features
seemed
to
be
dislimning
before
my
eyes
he
was
growing
sharper
finer
in
a
way
younger
a
man
without
grip
on
himself
a
shapeless
creature
in
process
of
transformation
he
was
being
reduced
to
his
rudiments
under
the
spell
of
panic
he
was
becoming
a
new
man
and
the
crazy
thing
was
that
i
knew
the
new
man
better
than
the
old
my
hands
were
jammed
close
to
my
sides
by
the
crowd
i
could
scarcely
turn
my
head
and
it
was
not
the
occasion
for
one
neighbours
to
observe
one
expression
if
it
had
been
mine
must
have
been
a
study
my
mind
was
far
away
from
air
raids
back
in
the
hot
summer
weather
of
i
saw
a
row
of
villas
perched
on
a
headland
above
the
sea
in
the
garden
of
one
of
them
two
men
were
playing
tennis
while
i
was
crouching
behind
an
adjacent
bush
one
of
these
was
a
plump
young
man
who
wore
a
coloured
scarf
round
his
waist
and
babbled
of
golf
handicaps
i
saw
him
again
in
the
villa
wearing
a
and
lisping
a
little
i
sat
opposite
him
at
bridge
i
beheld
him
collared
by
two
of
macgillivray
men
when
his
comrade
had
rushed
for
the
steps
that
led
to
the
sea
i
saw
too
the
of
my
old
flat
in
portland
place
and
heard
little
scudder
quick
anxious
voice
talking
about
the
three
men
he
feared
most
on
earth
one
of
whom
lisped
in
his
speech
i
had
thought
that
all
three
had
long
ago
been
laid
under
the
turf
he
was
not
looking
my
way
and
i
could
devour
his
face
in
safety
there
was
no
shadow
of
doubt
i
had
always
put
him
down
as
the
most
amazing
actor
on
earth
for
had
he
not
played
the
part
of
the
first
sea
lord
and
deluded
that
officer
daily
colleagues
but
he
could
do
far
more
than
any
human
actor
for
he
could
take
on
a
new
personality
and
with
it
a
new
appearance
and
live
steadily
in
the
character
as
if
he
had
been
born
in
it
my
mind
was
a
blank
and
i
could
only
make
blind
gropings
at
conclusions
how
had
he
escaped
the
death
of
a
spy
and
a
murderer
for
i
had
last
seen
him
in
the
hands
of
justice
of
course
he
had
known
me
from
the
first
day
in
biggleswick
i
had
thought
to
play
with
him
and
he
had
played
most
cunningly
and
damnably
with
me
in
that
sweating
of
refugees
i
shivered
in
the
bitterness
of
my
chagrin
and
then
i
found
his
face
turned
to
mine
and
i
knew
that
he
recognized
me
more
i
knew
that
he
knew
that
i
had
recognized
him
not
as
ivery
but
as
that
other
man
there
came
into
his
eyes
a
curious
look
of
comprehension
which
for
a
moment
overcame
his
funk
i
had
sense
enough
to
see
that
that
put
the
final
lid
on
it
there
was
still
something
doing
if
he
believed
that
i
was
blind
but
if
he
once
thought
that
i
knew
the
truth
he
would
be
through
our
meshes
and
disappear
like
a
fog
my
first
thought
was
to
get
at
him
and
collar
him
and
summon
everybody
to
help
me
by
denouncing
him
for
what
he
was
then
i
saw
that
that
was
impossible
i
was
a
private
soldier
in
a
borrowed
uniform
and
he
could
easily
turn
the
story
against
me
i
must
use
surer
weapons
i
must
get
to
bullivant
and
macgillivray
and
set
their
big
machine
to
work
above
all
i
must
get
to
blenkiron
i
started
to
squeeze
out
of
that
push
for
air
raids
now
seemed
far
too
trivial
to
give
a
thought
to
moreover
the
guns
had
stopped
but
so
sheeplike
is
human
nature
that
the
crowd
still
hung
together
and
it
took
me
a
good
fifteen
minutes
to
edge
my
way
to
the
open
air
i
found
that
the
trouble
was
over
and
the
street
had
resumed
its
usual
appearance
buses
and
taxis
were
running
and
voluble
knots
of
people
were
recounting
their
experiences
i
started
off
for
bookshop
as
the
nearest
harbour
of
refuge
but
in
piccadilly
circus
i
was
stopped
by
a
military
policeman
he
asked
my
name
and
battalion
and
i
gave
him
them
while
his
suspicious
eye
ran
over
my
figure
i
had
no
pack
or
rifle
and
the
crush
in
the
tube
station
had
not
improved
my
appearance
i
explained
that
i
was
going
back
to
france
that
evening
and
he
asked
for
my
warrant
i
fancy
my
preoccupation
made
me
nervous
and
i
lied
badly
i
said
i
had
left
it
with
my
kit
in
the
house
of
my
married
sister
but
i
fumbled
in
giving
the
address
i
could
see
that
the
fellow
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
just
then
up
came
an
he
was
a
pompous
very
splendid
in
his
red
tabs
and
probably
bucked
up
at
having
just
been
under
fire
anyhow
he
was
out
to
walk
in
the
strict
path
of
duty
he
said
we
got
some
fellow
of
that
name
on
our
records
bring
him
along
wilson
sir
i
said
must
i
simply
must
meet
my
friend
it
urgent
business
and
i
assure
you
i
all
right
if
you
do
believe
me
take
a
taxi
and
we
go
down
to
scotland
yard
and
i
stand
by
what
they
say
his
brow
grew
dark
with
wrath
infernal
nonsense
is
this
scotland
yard
what
the
devil
has
scotland
yard
to
do
with
it
an
imposter
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
i
have
your
depot
rung
up
and
you
be
in
jail
in
a
couple
of
hours
i
know
a
deserter
when
i
see
him
bring
him
along
wilson
you
know
what
to
do
if
he
tries
to
bolt
i
had
a
momentary
thought
of
breaking
away
but
decided
that
the
odds
were
too
much
against
me
fuming
with
impatience
i
followed
the
to
his
office
on
the
first
floor
in
a
side
street
the
precious
minutes
were
slipping
past
ivery
now
thoroughly
warned
was
making
good
his
escape
and
i
the
sole
repository
of
a
deadly
secret
was
tramping
in
this
absurd
procession
the
issued
his
orders
he
gave
instructions
that
my
depot
should
be
rung
up
and
he
bade
wilson
remove
me
to
what
he
called
the
he
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
busied
himself
with
a
mass
of
buff
dockets
in
desperation
i
renewed
my
appeal
implore
you
to
telephone
to
mr
macgillivray
at
scotland
yard
it
a
matter
of
life
and
death
sir
you
taking
a
very
big
responsibility
if
you
do
i
had
hopelessly
offended
his
brittle
dignity
more
of
your
insolence
and
i
have
you
put
in
irons
i
attend
to
you
soon
enough
for
your
comfort
get
out
of
this
till
i
send
for
you
as
i
looked
at
his
foolish
irritable
face
i
realized
that
i
was
fairly
up
against
it
short
of
assault
and
battery
on
everybody
i
was
bound
to
submit
i
saluted
respectfully
and
was
marched
away
the
hours
i
spent
in
that
bare
anteroom
are
like
a
nightmare
in
my
recollection
a
sergeant
was
busy
at
a
desk
with
more
buff
dockets
and
an
orderly
waited
on
a
stool
by
a
telephone
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
observed
that
it
was
one
soon
the
slamming
of
a
door
announced
that
the
had
gone
to
lunch
i
tried
conversation
with
the
fat
sergeant
but
he
very
soon
shut
me
up
so
i
sat
hunched
up
on
the
wooden
form
and
chewed
the
cud
of
my
vexation
i
thought
with
bitterness
of
the
satisfaction
which
had
filled
me
in
the
morning
i
had
fancied
myself
the
devil
of
a
fine
fellow
and
i
had
been
no
more
than
a
mountebank
the
adventures
of
the
past
days
seemed
merely
childish
i
had
been
telling
lies
and
cutting
capers
over
half
britain
thinking
i
was
playing
a
deep
game
and
i
had
only
been
behaving
like
a
schoolboy
on
such
occasions
a
man
is
rarely
just
to
himself
and
the
intensity
of
my
would
have
satisfied
my
worst
enemy
it
did
console
me
that
the
futility
of
it
all
was
not
my
blame
i
was
looking
for
excuses
it
was
the
facts
that
cried
out
against
me
and
on
the
facts
i
had
been
an
idiotic
failure
for
of
course
ivery
had
played
with
me
played
with
me
since
the
first
day
at
biggleswick
he
had
applauded
my
speeches
and
flattered
me
and
advised
me
to
go
to
the
clyde
laughing
at
me
all
the
time
gresson
too
had
known
now
i
saw
it
all
he
had
tried
to
drown
me
between
colonsay
and
mull
it
was
gresson
who
had
set
the
police
on
me
in
morvern
the
bagman
linklater
had
been
one
of
gresson
creatures
the
only
meagre
consolation
was
that
the
gang
had
thought
me
dangerous
enough
to
attempt
to
murder
me
and
that
they
knew
nothing
about
my
doings
in
skye
of
that
i
was
positive
they
had
marked
me
down
but
for
several
days
i
had
slipped
clean
out
of
their
ken
as
i
went
over
all
the
incidents
i
asked
if
everything
was
yet
lost
i
had
failed
to
hoodwink
ivery
but
i
had
found
out
his
post
office
and
if
he
only
believed
i
had
recognized
him
for
the
miscreant
of
the
black
stone
he
would
go
on
in
his
old
ways
and
play
into
hands
yes
but
i
had
seen
him
in
undress
so
to
speak
and
he
knew
that
i
had
so
seen
him
the
only
thing
now
was
to
collar
him
before
he
left
the
country
for
there
was
ample
evidence
to
hang
him
on
the
law
must
stretch
out
its
long
arm
and
collect
him
and
gresson
and
the
portuguese
jew
try
them
by
court
martial
and
put
them
decently
underground
but
he
had
now
had
more
than
an
hour
warning
and
i
was
entangled
with
in
this
damned
office
the
thought
drove
me
frantic
and
i
got
up
and
paced
the
floor
i
saw
the
orderly
with
rather
a
scared
face
making
ready
to
press
the
bell
and
i
noticed
that
the
fat
sergeant
had
gone
to
lunch
mate
i
said
you
feel
inclined
to
do
a
poor
fellow
a
good
turn
i
know
i
for
it
all
right
and
i
take
my
medicine
like
a
lamb
but
i
want
badly
to
put
a
telephone
call
through

the
answer

from
the
old
man

gone
out

urged

talkin
if
you
only

message
flush
of
money
and
i
do
mind
handin
you
a
quid
for
the
job
he
was
a
pinched
little
man
with
a
weak
chin
and
he
obviously
wavered
d
want
to
talk
to
he
asked
yard
i
said
home
of
the
police

he
said
old
man

hour
nor
the
sergeant
neither

quid
though
i
laid
a
pound

if

yard
and

over
to
the
instrument
want
to

the
bloke

long
name

at
the

name
anyhow
that
the
one
i
want
you
to
give
if
this
mac
man
comes
round
they
know
bin
rung
up
and
i
the
old
man
down
on
me
it
took
ten
minutes
and
a
second
pound
note
to
get
him
past
this
hurdle
by
and
by
he
screwed
up
courage
and
rang
up
the
number
i
listened
with
some
nervousness
while
he
gave
my
message
he
had
to
repeat
it
twice
and
waited
eagerly
on
the
next
words
sir
i
heard
him
say
do
want
you
to
come
round
thinks
as
i
mean
to
say
wants
i
took
a
long
stride
and
twitched
the
receiver
from
him
i
said
that
you
richard
hannay
for
the
love
of
god
come
round
here
this
instant
and
deliver
me
from
the
clutches
of
a
tomfool
i
got
the
most
deadly
news
there
not
a
second
to
waste
for
god
sake
come
quick
then
i
added
tell
your
fellows
to
gather
ivery
in
at
once
you
know
his
lairs
i
hung
up
the
receiver
and
faced
a
pale
and
indignant
orderly
all
right
i
said
promise
you
that
you
wo
get
into
any
trouble
on
my
account
and
there
your
two
quid
the
door
in
the
next
room
opened
and
shut
the
had
returned
from
lunch
ten
minutes
later
the
door
opened
again
i
heard
macgillivray
voice
and
it
was
not
pitched
in
dulcet
tones
he
had
run
up
against
minor
officialdom
and
was
making
hay
with
it
i
was
my
own
master
once
more
so
i
forsook
the
company
of
the
orderly
i
found
a
most
rattled
officer
trying
to
save
a
few
rags
of
his
dignity
and
the
formidable
figure
of
macgillivray
instructing
him
in
manners
to
see
you
dick
he
said
is
general
hannay
sir
it
may
comfort
you
to
know
that
your
folly
may
have
made
just
the
difference
between
your
country
victory
and
defeat
i
shall
have
a
word
to
say
to
your
superiors
it
was
hardly
fair
i
had
to
put
in
a
word
for
the
old
fellow
whose
red
tabs
seemed
suddenly
to
have
grown
dingy
was
my
blame
wearing
this
kit
we
call
it
a
misunderstanding
and
forget
it
but
i
would
suggest
that
civility
is
not
wasted
even
on
a
poor
devil
of
a
defaulting
private
soldier
once
in
macgillivray
car
i
poured
out
my
tale
me
it
a
nightmare
i
cried
me
that
the
three
men
we
collected
on
the
ruff
were
shot
long
ago
he
replied
one
escaped
heaven
knows
how
he
managed
it
but
he
disappeared
clean
out
of
the
world
plump
one
who
lisped
in
his
speech
macgillivray
nodded
we
in
for
it
this
time
have
you
issued
instructions
with
luck
we
shall
have
our
hands
on
him
within
an
hour
our
net
round
all
his
haunts
two
hours
start
it
a
big
handicap
for
you
dealing
with
a
genius
i
think
we
can
manage
it
where
are
you
bound
for
i
told
him
my
rooms
in
westminster
and
then
to
my
old
flat
in
park
lane
day
of
disguises
is
past
in
half
an
hour
i
be
richard
hannay
it
be
a
comfort
to
get
into
uniform
again
then
i
look
up
blenkiron
he
grinned
gather
you
had
a
riotous
time
we
had
a
good
many
anxious
messages
from
the
north
about
a
certain
mr
brand
i
discourage
our
men
for
i
fancied
it
might
have
spoiled
your
game
i
heard
that
last
night
they
had
lost
touch
with
you
in
bradfield
so
i
rather
expected
to
see
you
here
today
efficient
body
of
men
the
scottish
police
when
they
have
various
enthusiastic
amateur
helpers
he
said
of
course
they
would
have
but
i
hope
presently
to
congratulate
you
on
the
success
of
your
mission
bet
you
a
pony
you
do
i
said
never
bet
on
a
professional
subject
why
this
pessimism
that
i
know
our
gentleman
better
than
you
i
been
twice
up
against
him
he
the
kind
of
wicked
that
do
cease
from
troubling
till
they
and
even
then
i
want
to
see
the
body
cremated
and
take
the
ashes
into
and
scatter
them
i
got
a
feeling
that
he
the
biggest
thing
you
or
i
will
ever
tackle
chapter
eleven
the
valley
of
humiliation
i
collected
some
baggage
and
a
pile
of
newly
arrived
letters
from
my
rooms
in
westminster
and
took
a
taxi
to
my
park
lane
flat
usually
i
had
gone
back
to
that
old
place
with
a
great
feeling
of
comfort
like
a
boy
from
school
who
ranges
about
his
room
at
home
and
examines
his
treasures
i
used
to
like
to
see
my
hunting
trophies
on
the
wall
and
to
sink
into
my
own
armchairs
but
now
i
had
no
pleasure
in
the
thing
i
had
a
bath
and
changed
into
uniform
and
that
made
me
feel
in
better
fighting
trim
but
i
suffered
from
a
heavy
conviction
of
abject
failure
and
had
no
share
in
macgillivray
optimism
the
awe
with
which
the
black
stone
gang
had
filled
me
three
years
before
had
revived
a
thousandfold
personal
humiliation
was
the
least
part
of
my
trouble
what
worried
me
was
the
sense
of
being
up
against
something
inhumanly
formidable
and
wise
and
strong
i
believed
i
was
willing
to
own
defeat
and
chuck
up
the
game
among
the
unopened
letters
was
one
from
peter
a
very
bulky
one
which
i
sat
down
to
read
at
leisure
it
was
a
curious
epistle
far
the
longest
he
had
ever
written
me
and
its
size
made
me
understand
his
loneliness
he
was
still
at
his
german
but
expecting
every
day
to
go
to
switzerland
he
said
he
could
get
back
to
england
or
south
africa
if
he
wanted
for
they
were
clear
that
he
could
never
be
a
combatant
again
but
he
thought
he
had
better
stay
in
switzerland
for
he
would
be
unhappy
in
england
with
all
his
friends
fighting
as
usual
he
made
no
complaints
and
seemed
to
be
very
grateful
for
his
small
mercies
there
was
a
doctor
who
was
kind
to
him
and
some
good
fellows
among
the
prisoners
but
peter
letter
was
made
up
chiefly
of
reflection
he
had
always
been
a
bit
of
a
philosopher
and
now
in
his
isolation
he
had
taken
to
thinking
hard
and
poured
out
the
results
to
me
on
pages
of
thin
paper
in
his
clumsy
handwriting
i
could
read
between
the
lines
that
he
was
having
a
stiff
fight
with
himself
he
was
trying
to
keep
his
courage
going
in
face
of
the
bitterest
trial
he
could
be
called
on
to
face
a
crippled
old
age
he
had
always
known
a
good
deal
about
the
bible
and
that
and
the
were
his
chief
aids
in
reflection
both
he
took
quite
literally
as
if
they
were
newspaper
reports
of
actual
recent
events
he
mentioned
that
after
much
consideration
he
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
three
greatest
men
he
had
ever
heard
of
or
met
were
mr
the
apostle
paul
and
a
certain
billy
strang
who
had
been
with
him
in
mashonaland
in
billy
i
knew
all
about
he
had
been
peter
hero
and
leader
till
a
lion
got
him
in
the
blaauwberg
peter
preferred
to
mr
greatheart
i
think
because
of
his
superior
truculence
for
being
very
gentle
himself
he
loved
a
bold
speaker
after
that
he
dropped
into
a
vein
of
he
regretted
that
he
fell
far
short
of
any
of
the
three
he
thought
that
he
might
with
luck
resemble
mr
standfast
for
like
him
he
had
not
much
trouble
in
keeping
wakeful
and
was
also
as
as
a
howler
and
did
care
for
women
he
only
hoped
that
he
could
imitate
him
in
making
a
good
end
then
followed
some
remarks
of
peter
on
courage
which
came
to
me
in
that
london
room
as
if
spoken
by
his
living
voice
i
have
never
known
anyone
so
brave
so
brave
by
instinct
or
anyone
who
hated
so
much
to
be
told
so
it
was
almost
the
only
thing
that
could
make
him
angry
all
his
life
he
had
been
facing
death
and
to
take
risks
seemed
to
him
as
natural
as
to
get
up
in
the
morning
and
eat
his
breakfast
but
he
had
started
out
to
consider
the
very
thing
which
before
he
had
taken
for
granted
and
here
is
an
extract
from
his
conclusions
i
paraphrase
him
for
he
was
not
grammatical
easy
enough
to
be
brave
if
you
feeling
well
and
have
food
inside
you
and
it
not
so
difficult
even
if
you
short
of
a
meal
and
seedy
for
that
makes
you
inclined
to
gamble
i
mean
by
being
brave
playing
the
game
by
the
right
rules
without
letting
it
worry
you
that
you
may
very
likely
get
knocked
on
the
head
it
the
wisest
way
to
save
your
skin
it
does
do
to
think
about
death
if
you
facing
a
charging
lion
or
trying
to
bluff
a
lot
of
savages
if
you
think
about
it
you
get
it
if
you
do
the
odds
are
you
wo
that
kind
of
courage
is
only
good
nerves
and
experience
most
courage
is
experience
most
people
are
a
little
scared
at
new
things
want
a
bigger
heart
to
face
danger
which
you
go
out
to
look
for
and
which
does
come
to
you
in
the
ordinary
way
of
business
still
that
pretty
much
the
same
thing
good
nerves
and
good
health
and
a
natural
liking
for
rows
you
see
dick
in
all
that
game
there
a
lot
of
fun
there
excitement
and
the
fun
of
using
your
wits
and
skill
and
you
know
that
the
bad
bits
ca
last
long
when
arcoll
sent
me
to
makapan
kraal
i
did
altogether
fancy
the
job
but
at
the
worst
it
was
three
parts
sport
and
i
got
so
excited
that
i
never
thought
of
the
risk
till
it
was
over
the
big
courage
is
the
kind
the
kind
that
never
lets
go
even
when
you
feeling
empty
inside
and
your
blood
thin
and
there
no
kind
of
fun
or
profit
to
be
had
and
the
trouble
not
over
in
an
hour
or
two
but
lasts
for
months
and
years
one
of
the
men
here
was
speaking
about
that
kind
and
he
called
it
i
reckon
fortitude
the
biggest
thing
a
man
can
have
just
to
go
on
enduring
when
there
no
guts
or
heart
left
in
you
billy
had
it
when
he
trekked
solitary
from
garungoze
to
the
limpopo
with
fever
and
a
broken
arm
just
to
show
the
portugooses
that
he
would
be
downed
by
them
but
the
head
man
at
the
job
was
the
apostle
paul
peter
was
writing
for
his
own
comfort
for
fortitude
was
all
that
was
left
to
him
now
but
his
words
came
pretty
straight
to
me
and
i
read
them
again
and
again
for
i
needed
the
lesson
here
was
i
losing
heart
just
because
i
had
failed
in
the
first
round
and
my
pride
had
taken
a
knock
i
felt
honestly
ashamed
of
myself
and
that
made
me
a
far
happier
man
there
could
be
no
question
of
dropping
the
business
whatever
its
difficulties
i
had
a
queer
religious
feeling
that
ivery
and
i
had
our
fortunes
intertwined
and
that
no
will
of
mine
could
keep
us
apart
i
had
faced
him
before
the
war
and
won
i
had
faced
him
again
and
lost
the
third
time
or
the
twentieth
time
we
would
reach
a
final
decision
the
whole
business
had
hitherto
appeared
to
me
a
trifle
unreal
at
any
rate
my
own
connection
with
it
i
had
been
docilely
obeying
orders
but
my
real
self
had
been
standing
aside
and
watching
my
doings
with
a
certain
aloofness
but
that
hour
in
the
tube
station
had
brought
me
into
the
serum
and
i
saw
the
affair
not
as
or
even
blenkiron
but
as
my
own
before
i
had
been
itching
to
get
back
to
the
front
now
i
wanted
to
get
on
to
ivery
trail
though
it
should
take
me
through
the
nether
pit
peter
was
right
fortitude
was
the
thing
a
man
must
possess
if
he
would
save
his
soul
the
hours
passed
and
as
i
expected
there
came
no
word
from
macgillivray
i
had
some
dinner
sent
up
to
me
at
seven
and
about
eight
i
was
thinking
of
looking
up
blenkiron
just
then
came
a
telephone
call
asking
me
to
go
round
to
sir
walter
bullivant
house
in
queen
anne
gate
ten
minutes
later
i
was
ringing
the
bell
and
the
door
was
opened
to
me
by
the
same
impassive
butler
who
had
admitted
me
on
that
famous
night
three
years
before
nothing
had
changed
in
the
pleasant
hall
the
alcove
was
the
same
as
when
i
had
watched
from
it
the
departure
of
the
man
who
now
called
himself
ivery
the
telephone
book
lay
in
the
very
place
from
which
i
had
snatched
it
in
order
to
ring
up
the
first
sea
lord
and
in
the
back
room
where
that
night
five
anxious
officials
had
conferred
i
found
sir
walter
and
blenkiron
both
looked
worried
the
american
feverishly
so
he
walked
up
and
down
the
hearthrug
sucking
an
unlit
black
cigar
dick
he
said
is
a
bad
business
it
was
no
fault
of
yours
you
did
fine
it
was
us
me
and
sir
walter
and
mr
macgillivray
that
were
the
quitters
news
i
asked
far
the
cover
drawn
blank
sir
walter
replied
was
the
devil
own
work
that
our
friend
looked
your
way
today
you
pretty
certain
he
saw
that
you
recognized
him
as
sure
as
that
he
knew
i
recognized
him
in
your
hall
three
years
ago
when
he
was
swaggering
as
lord
alloa
said
blenkiron
dolefully
little
flicker
of
recognition
is
just
the
one
thing
you
ca
be
wrong
about
land
alive
i
wish
mr
macgillivray
would
come
the
bell
rang
and
the
door
opened
but
it
was
not
macgillivray
it
was
a
young
girl
in
a
white
with
a
cluster
of
blue
cornflowers
at
her
breast
the
sight
of
her
fetched
sir
walter
out
of
his
chair
so
suddenly
that
he
upset
his
coffee
cup
my
dear
how
did
you
manage
it
i
did
expect
you
till
the
late
train
was
in
london
you
see
and
they
telephoned
on
your
telegram
staying
with
aunt
doria
and
i
cut
her
theatre
party
she
thinks
i
at
the
shandwick
dance
so
i
need
go
home
till
morning
good
evening
general
hannay
you
got
over
the
hill
difficulty
next
stage
is
the
valley
of
humiliation
i
answered
it
would
appear
she
said
gravely
and
sat
very
quietly
on
the
edge
of
sir
walter
chair
with
her
small
cool
hand
upon
his
i
had
been
picturing
her
in
my
recollection
as
very
young
and
glimmering
a
dancing
exquisite
child
but
now
i
revised
that
picture
the
crystal
freshness
of
morning
was
still
there
but
i
saw
how
deep
the
waters
were
it
was
the
clean
fineness
and
strength
of
her
that
entranced
me
i
did
even
think
of
her
as
pretty
any
more
than
a
man
thinks
of
the
good
looks
of
the
friend
he
worships
we
waited
hardly
speaking
a
word
till
macgillivray
came
the
first
sight
of
his
face
told
his
story
asked
blenkiron
sharply
the
man
lethargic
calm
seemed
to
have
wholly
deserted
him
repeated
the
newcomer
have
just
tracked
him
down
oh
he
managed
it
cleverly
never
a
sign
of
disturbance
in
any
of
his
lairs
his
dinner
ordered
at
biggleswick
and
several
people
invited
to
stay
with
him
for
the
weekend
one
a
member
of
the
government
two
meetings
at
which
he
was
to
speak
arranged
for
next
week
early
this
afternoon
he
flew
over
to
france
as
a
passenger
in
one
of
the
new
planes
he
had
been
mixed
up
with
the
air
board
people
for
months
of
course
as
another
man
with
another
face
miss
lamington
discovered
that
just
too
late
the
bus
went
out
of
its
course
and
came
down
in
normandy
by
this
time
our
man
in
paris
or
beyond
it
sir
walter
took
off
his
big
tortoiseshell
spectacles
and
laid
them
carefully
on
the
table
up
the
map
of
europe
he
said
is
our
austerlitz
mary
my
dear
i
am
feeling
very
old
macgillivray
had
the
sharpened
face
of
a
bitterly
disappointed
man
blenkiron
had
got
very
red
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
blaspheming
violently
under
his
breath
mary
eyes
were
quiet
and
solemn
she
kept
on
patting
sir
walter
hand
the
sense
of
some
great
impending
disaster
hung
heavily
on
me
and
to
break
the
spell
i
asked
for
details
me
just
the
extent
of
the
damage
i
asked
neat
plan
for
deceiving
the
boche
has
failed
that
is
bad
a
dangerous
spy
has
got
beyond
our
power
that
worse
tell
me
is
there
still
a
worst
the
limit
of
mischief
he
can
do
sir
walter
had
risen
and
joined
blenkiron
on
the
hearthrug
his
brows
were
furrowed
and
his
mouth
hard
as
if
he
were
suffering
pain
is
no
limit
he
said
that
i
can
see
except
the
of
god
you
know
the
man
as
ivery
and
you
knew
him
as
that
other
whom
you
believed
to
have
been
shot
one
summer
morning
and
decently
buried
you
feared
the
second
at
least
if
you
did
i
did
most
mortally
you
realized
that
we
feared
ivery
and
you
knew
enough
about
him
to
see
his
fiendish
cleverness
well
you
have
the
two
men
combined
in
one
man
ivery
was
the
best
brain
macgillivray
and
i
ever
encountered
the
most
cunning
and
patient
and
combine
him
with
the
other
the
chameleon
who
can
blend
himself
with
his
environment
and
has
as
many
personalities
as
there
are
types
and
traits
on
the
earth
what
kind
of
enemy
is
that
to
have
to
fight
admit
it
a
steep
proposition
but
after
all
how
much
ill
can
he
do
there
are
pretty
strict
limits
to
the
activity
of
even
the
cleverest
spy
agree
but
this
man
is
not
a
spy
who
buys
a
few
wretched
subordinates
and
steals
a
dozen
private
letters
he
a
genius
who
has
been
living
as
part
of
our
english
life
there
nothing
he
seen
he
been
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
all
kinds
of
politicians
we
know
that
he
did
it
as
ivery
they
rather
liked
him
for
he
was
clever
and
flattered
them
and
they
told
him
things
but
god
knows
what
he
saw
and
heard
in
his
other
personalities
for
all
i
know
he
may
have
breakfasted
at
downing
street
with
letters
of
introduction
from
president
wilson
or
visited
the
grand
fleet
as
a
distinguished
neutral
then
think
of
the
women
how
they
talk
we
the
leakiest
society
on
earth
and
we
safeguard
ourselves
by
keeping
dangerous
people
out
of
it
we
trust
to
our
outer
barrage
but
anyone
who
has
really
slipped
inside
has
a
million
chances
and
this
remember
is
one
man
in
ten
millions
a
man
whose
brain
never
sleeps
for
a
moment
who
is
quick
to
seize
the
slightest
hint
who
can
piece
a
plan
together
out
of
a
dozen
bits
of
gossip
it
like
it
as
if
the
chief
of
the
intelligence
department
were
suddenly
to
desert
to
the
enemy
the
ordinary
spy
knows
only
bits
of
unconnected
facts
this
man
knows
our
life
and
our
way
of
thinking
and
everything
about
us
but
a
treatise
on
english
life
in
time
of
war
wo
do
much
good
to
the
boche
sir
walter
shook
his
head
you
realize
the
explosive
stuff
that
is
lying
about
ivery
knows
enough
to
make
the
next
german
peace
offensive
really
deadly
not
the
blundering
thing
which
it
has
been
up
to
now
but
something
which
gets
our
weak
spots
on
the
raw
he
knows
enough
to
wreck
our
campaign
in
the
field
and
the
awful
thing
is
that
we
do
know
just
what
he
knows
or
what
he
is
aiming
for
this
war
a
packet
of
surprises
both
sides
are
struggling
for
the
margin
the
little
fraction
of
advantage
and
between
evenly
matched
enemies
just
the
extra
atom
of
foreknowledge
that
tells
we
got
to
push
off
and
get
after
him
i
said
cheerfully
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
macgillivray
it
were
merely
a
question
of
destroying
an
organization
it
might
be
managed
for
an
organization
presents
a
big
front
but
it
a
question
of
destroying
this
one
man
and
his
front
is
a
razor
edge
how
are
you
going
to
find
him
it
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
and
such
a
needle
a
needle
which
can
become
a
piece
of
straw
or
a
when
it
chooses
the
same
we
got
to
do
it
i
said
remembering
old
lesson
on
fortitude
though
i
ca
say
i
was
feeling
very
sir
walter
flung
himself
wearily
into
an
wish
i
could
be
an
optimist
he
said
it
looks
as
if
we
must
own
defeat
been
at
this
work
for
twenty
years
and
though
i
been
often
beaten
i
always
held
certain
cards
in
the
game
now
i
hanged
if
i
any
it
looks
like
a
hannay
it
no
good
deluding
ourselves
we
men
enough
to
look
facts
in
the
face
and
tell
ourselves
the
truth
i
do
see
any
ray
of
light
in
the
business
we
missed
our
shot
by
a
hairsbreadth
and
that
the
same
as
missing
by
miles
i
remember
he
looked
at
mary
as
if
for
confirmation
but
she
did
not
smile
or
nod
her
face
was
very
grave
and
her
eyes
looked
steadily
at
him
then
they
moved
and
met
mine
and
they
seemed
to
give
me
my
marching
orders
walter
i
said
years
ago
you
and
i
sat
in
this
very
room
we
thought
we
were
done
to
the
world
as
we
think
now
we
had
just
that
one
miserable
little
clue
to
hang
on
to
a
dozen
words
scribbled
in
a
notebook
by
a
dead
man
you
thought
i
was
mad
when
i
asked
for
scudder
book
but
we
put
our
backs
into
the
job
and
in
hours
we
had
won
out
remember
that
then
we
were
fighting
against
time
now
we
have
a
reasonable
amount
of
leisure
then
we
had
nothing
but
a
sentence
of
gibberish
now
we
have
a
great
body
of
knowledge
for
blenkiron
has
been
brooding
over
ivery
like
an
old
hen
and
he
knows
his
ways
of
working
and
his
breed
of
confederate
you
got
something
to
work
on
now
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
when
the
stakes
are
so
big
you
going
to
chuck
in
your
hand
macgillivray
raised
his
head
know
a
good
deal
about
ivery
but
ivery
dead
we
know
nothing
of
the
man
who
was
gloriously
resurrected
this
evening
in
normandy
yes
we
do
there
are
many
faces
to
the
man
but
only
one
mind
and
you
know
plenty
about
that
mind
wonder
said
sir
walter
can
you
know
a
mind
which
has
no
characteristics
except
that
it
is
wholly
and
supremely
competent
mere
mental
powers
wo
give
us
a
clue
we
want
to
know
the
character
which
is
behind
all
the
personalities
above
all
we
want
to
know
its
foibles
if
we
had
only
a
hint
of
some
weakness
we
might
make
a
plan
let
set
down
all
we
know
i
cried
for
the
more
i
argued
the
keener
i
grew
i
told
them
in
some
detail
the
story
of
the
night
in
the
coolin
and
what
i
had
heard
there
the
two
names
chelius
and
bommaerts
the
man
spoke
them
in
the
same
breath
as
elfenbein
so
they
must
be
associated
with
ivery
gang
you
got
to
get
the
whole
secret
service
of
the
allies
busy
to
fit
a
meaning
to
these
two
words
surely
to
goodness
you
find
something
remember
those
names
do
belong
to
the
ivery
part
but
to
the
big
game
behind
all
the
different
disguises
then
there
the
talk
about
the
wild
birds
and
the
cage
birds
i
have
a
guess
at
what
it
means
but
it
refers
to
some
infernal
gang
and
among
your
piles
of
records
there
must
be
some
clue
you
set
the
intelligence
of
two
hemispheres
busy
on
the
job
you
got
all
the
machinery
and
it
my
experience
that
if
even
one
solitary
man
keeps
chewing
on
at
a
problem
he
discovers
something
my
enthusiasm
was
beginning
to
strike
sparks
from
macgillivray
he
was
looking
thoughtful
now
instead
of
despondent
might
be
something
in
that
he
said
it
a
chance
course
it
a
chance
and
that
all
we
ever
going
to
get
from
ivery
but
we
taken
a
bad
chance
before
and
won
then
you
all
that
you
know
about
ivery
here
go
through
his
with
a
comb
and
i
bet
you
find
something
to
work
on
blenkiron
you
a
man
with
a
cool
head
you
admit
we
a
sporting
chance
dick
he
fixed
things
so
that
the
lines
are
across
the
track
but
we
clear
somehow
so
far
as
john
blenkiron
is
concerned
got
just
one
thing
to
do
in
this
world
and
that
to
follow
the
yellow
dog
and
have
him
neatly
and
cleanly
tidied
up
i
got
a
stack
of
personal
affronts
to
settle
i
was
easy
fruit
and
he
has
been
very
respectful
you
can
count
me
in
dick
we
agreed
i
cried
gentlemen
it
up
to
you
to
arrange
the
first
stage
you
some
pretty
solid
staff
work
to
put
in
before
you
get
on
the
trail
you
sir
walter
asked
going
back
to
my
brigade
i
want
a
rest
and
a
change
besides
the
first
stage
is
office
work
and
i
no
use
for
that
but
i
be
waiting
to
be
summoned
and
i
come
like
a
shot
as
soon
as
you
hoick
me
out
i
got
a
presentiment
about
this
thing
i
know
there
be
a
finish
and
that
i
be
in
at
it
and
i
think
it
will
be
a
desperate
bloody
business
too
i
found
mary
eyes
fixed
upon
me
and
in
them
i
read
the
same
thought
she
had
not
spoken
a
word
but
had
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
swinging
a
foot
idly
one
hand
playing
with
an
ivory
fan
she
had
given
me
my
old
orders
and
i
looked
to
her
for
confirmation
of
the
new
lamington
you
are
the
wisest
of
the
lot
of
us
what
do
you
say
she
smiled
that
shy
companionable
smile
which
i
had
been
picturing
to
myself
through
all
the
wanderings
of
the
past
month
think
you
are
right
we
a
long
way
to
go
yet
for
the
valley
of
humiliation
comes
only
in
the
the
next
stage
was
vanity
fair
i
might
be
of
some
use
there
do
you
think
i
remember
the
way
she
laughed
and
flung
back
her
head
like
a
gallant
boy
mistake
we
all
been
making
she
said
that
our
methods
are
too
we
a
poet
to
deal
with
a
great
poet
and
we
must
fling
our
imaginations
forward
to
catch
up
with
him
his
strength
is
his
unexpectedness
you
know
and
we
wo
beat
him
by
plodding
only
i
believe
the
wildest
course
is
the
wisest
for
it
the
most
likely
to
intersect
his
who
the
poet
among
us
i
said
he
pinned
down
with
a
game
leg
in
germany
all
the
same
we
must
rope
him
in
by
this
time
we
had
all
cheered
up
for
it
is
wonderful
what
a
tonic
there
is
in
a
prospect
of
action
the
butler
brought
in
tea
which
it
was
bullivant
habit
to
drink
after
dinner
to
me
it
seemed
fantastic
to
watch
a
slip
of
a
girl
pouring
it
out
for
two
grizzled
and
distinguished
servants
of
the
state
and
one
battered
soldier
as
decorous
a
family
party
as
you
would
ask
to
see
and
to
reflect
that
all
four
were
engaged
in
an
enterprise
where
men
lives
must
be
reckoned
at
less
than
thistledown
after
that
we
went
upstairs
to
a
noble
georgian
and
mary
played
to
us
i
do
care
two
straws
for
music
from
an
instrument
unless
it
be
the
pipes
or
a
regimental
band
but
i
dearly
love
the
human
voice
but
she
would
not
sing
for
singing
to
her
i
fancy
was
something
that
did
not
come
at
will
but
flowed
only
like
a
bird
note
when
the
mood
favoured
i
did
not
want
it
either
i
was
content
to
let
ripe
be
the
one
song
linked
with
her
in
my
memory
it
was
macgillivray
who
brought
us
back
to
business
wish
to
heaven
there
was
one
habit
of
mind
we
could
definitely
attach
to
him
and
to
no
one
else
at
this
moment
had
only
one
meaning
for
us
ca
do
nothing
with
his
mind
blenkiron
drawled
loose
the
bands
of
orion
as
the
bible
says
or
hold
leviathan
with
a
hook
i
reckoned
i
could
and
made
a
mighty
close
study
of
his
but
the
darned
cuss
would
stay
put
i
thought
i
had
tied
him
down
to
the
double
bluff
and
he
went
and
played
the
triple
bluff
on
me
there
nothing
doing
that
line
a
memory
of
peter
recurred
to
me
about
the
blind
spot
i
asked
and
i
told
them
old
peter
pet
theory
man
that
god
made
has
his
weak
spot
somewhere
some
flaw
in
his
character
which
leaves
a
dull
patch
in
his
brain
we
got
to
find
that
out
and
i
think
i
made
a
beginning
macgillivray
in
a
sharp
voice
asked
my
meaning
in
a
funk
of
something
oh
i
do
mean
he
a
coward
a
man
in
his
trade
wants
the
nerve
of
a
buffalo
he
could
give
us
all
points
in
courage
what
i
mean
is
that
he
not
clean
white
all
through
there
are
yellow
streaks
somewhere
in
him
i
given
a
good
deal
of
thought
to
this
courage
business
for
i
have
got
a
great
deal
of
it
myself
not
like
peter
i
mean
i
got
heaps
of
soft
places
in
me
i
afraid
of
being
drowned
for
one
thing
or
of
getting
my
eyes
shot
out
ivery
afraid
of
bombs
at
any
rate
he
afraid
of
bombs
in
a
big
city
i
once
read
a
book
which
talked
about
a
thing
called
agoraphobia
perhaps
it
that
now
if
we
know
that
weak
spot
it
helps
us
in
our
work
there
are
some
places
he
wo
go
to
and
there
are
some
things
he
ca
do
not
well
anyway
i
reckon
that
useful
said
macgillivray
it
not
what
you
call
a
burning
and
a
shining
light
another
chink
in
his
armour
i
went
on
one
person
in
the
world
he
can
never
practise
his
transformations
on
and
me
i
shall
always
know
him
again
though
he
appeared
as
sir
douglas
haig
i
ca
explain
why
but
i
got
a
feel
in
my
bones
about
it
i
did
recognize
him
before
for
i
thought
he
was
dead
and
the
nerve
in
my
brain
which
should
have
been
looking
for
him
was
working
but
i
on
my
guard
now
and
that
nerve
functioning
at
full
power
whenever
and
wherever
and
howsoever
we
meet
again
on
the
face
of
the
earth
it
will
be
dr
livingstone
i
presume
between
him
and
me
is
better
said
macgillivray
we
have
any
luck
hannay
it
wo
be
long
till
we
pull
you
out
of
his
majesty
forces
mary
got
up
from
the
piano
and
resumed
her
old
perch
on
the
arm
of
sir
walter
chair
another
blind
spot
which
you
have
mentioned
it
was
a
cool
evening
but
i
noticed
that
her
cheeks
had
suddenly
flushed
week
mr
ivery
asked
me
to
marry
him
she
said
part
ii
chapter
twelve
i
become
a
combatant
once
more
i
returned
to
france
on
september
and
took
over
my
old
brigade
on
the
of
the
same
month
we
were
shoved
in
at
the
polygon
wood
on
the
and
after
four
days
got
so
badly
mauled
that
we
were
brought
out
to
refit
on
october
very
much
to
my
surprise
i
was
given
command
of
a
division
and
was
on
the
fringes
of
the
ypres
fighting
during
the
first
days
of
november
from
that
front
we
were
hurried
down
to
cambrai
in
support
but
came
in
only
for
the
last
backwash
of
that
singular
battle
we
held
a
bit
of
the
st
quentin
sector
till
just
before
christmas
when
we
had
a
spell
of
rest
in
billets
which
endured
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
till
the
beginning
of
january
when
i
was
sent
off
on
the
errand
which
i
shall
presently
relate
that
is
a
brief
summary
of
my
military
record
in
the
latter
part
of
i
am
not
going
to
enlarge
on
the
fighting
except
for
the
days
of
the
polygon
wood
it
was
neither
very
severe
nor
very
distinguished
and
you
will
find
it
in
the
history
books
what
i
have
to
tell
of
here
is
my
own
personal
quest
for
all
the
time
i
was
living
with
my
mind
turned
two
ways
in
the
morasses
of
the
haanebeek
flats
in
the
slimy
support
lines
at
zonnebeke
in
the
tortured
uplands
about
flesquieres
and
in
many
other
odd
places
i
kept
worrying
at
my
private
conundrum
at
night
i
would
lie
awake
thinking
of
it
and
many
a
toss
i
took
into
and
many
a
time
i
stepped
off
the
duckboards
because
my
eyes
were
on
a
different
landscape
nobody
ever
chewed
a
few
wretched
clues
into
such
a
pulp
as
i
did
during
those
bleak
months
in
flanders
and
picardy
for
i
had
an
instinct
that
the
thing
was
desperately
grave
graver
even
than
the
battle
before
me
russia
had
gone
headlong
to
the
devil
italy
had
taken
it
between
the
eyes
and
was
still
dizzy
and
our
own
prospects
were
none
too
bright
the
boche
was
getting
uppish
and
with
some
cause
and
i
foresaw
a
rocky
time
ahead
till
america
could
line
up
with
us
in
the
field
it
was
the
chance
for
the
wild
birds
and
i
used
to
wake
in
a
sweat
to
think
what
devilry
ivery
might
be
engineering
i
believe
i
did
my
proper
job
reasonably
well
but
i
put
in
my
most
savage
thinking
over
the
other
i
remember
how
i
used
to
go
over
every
hour
of
every
day
from
that
june
night
in
the
cotswolds
till
my
last
meeting
with
bullivant
in
london
trying
to
find
a
new
bearing
i
should
probably
have
got
if
i
had
had
to
spend
most
of
my
days
and
nights
fighting
a
stiffish
battle
with
a
very
watchful
hun
that
kept
my
mind
balanced
and
i
dare
say
it
gave
an
edge
to
it
for
during
those
months
i
was
lucky
enough
to
hit
on
a
better
scent
than
bullivant
and
macgillivray
and
blenkiron
pulling
a
thousand
wires
in
their
london
offices
i
will
set
down
in
order
of
time
the
various
incidents
in
this
private
quest
of
mine
the
first
was
my
meeting
with
geordie
hamilton
it
happened
just
after
i
rejoined
the
brigade
when
i
went
down
to
have
a
look
at
our
scots
fusilier
battalion
the
old
brigade
had
been
roughly
handled
on
july
and
had
had
to
get
heavy
drafts
to
come
anywhere
near
strength
the
fusiliers
especially
were
almost
a
new
lot
formed
by
joining
our
remnants
to
the
remains
of
a
battalion
in
another
division
and
bringing
about
a
dozen
officers
from
the
training
unit
at
home
i
inspected
the
men
and
my
eyes
caught
sight
of
a
familiar
face
i
asked
his
name
and
the
colonel
got
it
from
the
it
was
george
hamilton
now
i
wanted
a
new
batman
and
i
resolved
then
and
there
to
have
my
old
antagonist
that
afternoon
he
reported
to
me
at
brigade
headquarters
as
i
looked
at
that
solid
figure
standing
as
stiff
to
attention
as
a
tobacconist
sign
his
ugly
face
hewn
out
of
brown
oak
his
honest
sullen
mouth
and
his
blue
eyes
staring
into
vacancy
i
knew
i
had
got
the
man
i
wanted
i
said
and
i
have
met
before
came
the
mystified
answer
at
me
man
and
tell
me
if
you
do
recognize
me
he
moved
his
eyes
a
fraction
in
a
respectful
glance
i
do
mind
of
you
i
refresh
your
memory
do
you
remember
the
hall
in
newmilns
street
and
the
meeting
there
you
had
a
fight
with
a
man
outside
and
got
knocked
down
he
made
no
answer
but
his
colour
deepened
a
fortnight
later
in
a
in
muirtown
you
saw
the
same
man
and
gave
him
the
chase
of
his
life
i
could
see
his
mouth
set
for
visions
of
the
penalties
laid
down
by
the
king
regulations
for
striking
an
officer
must
have
crossed
his
mind
but
he
never
budged
me
in
the
face
man
i
said
you
remember
me
now
he
did
as
he
was
bid
i
mind
of
you
you
nothing
more
to
say
he
cleared
his
throat
i
did
not
ken
i
was
hittin
an
officer
course
you
did
you
did
perfectly
right
and
if
the
war
was
over
and
we
were
both
free
men
i
would
give
you
a
chance
of
knocking
me
down
here
and
now
that
got
to
wait
when
you
saw
me
last
i
was
serving
my
country
though
you
did
know
it
we
serving
together
now
and
you
must
get
your
revenge
out
of
the
boche
i
going
to
make
you
my
servant
for
you
and
i
have
a
pretty
close
bond
between
us
what
do
you
say
to
that
this
time
he
looked
me
full
in
the
face
his
troubled
eye
appraised
me
and
was
satisfied
proud
to
be
servant
to
ye
sirr
he
said
then
out
of
his
chest
came
a
strangled
chuckle
and
he
forgot
his
discipline
but
ye
the
great
lad
he
recovered
himself
promptly
saluted
and
marched
off
the
second
episode
befell
during
our
brief
rest
after
the
polygon
wood
when
i
had
ridden
down
the
line
one
afternoon
to
see
a
friend
in
the
heavy
artillery
i
was
returning
in
the
drizzle
of
evening
clanking
along
the
greasy
path
between
the
sad
poplars
when
i
struck
a
labour
company
repairing
the
ravages
of
a
boche
strafe
that
morning
i
very
certain
of
my
road
and
asked
one
of
the
workers
he
straightened
himself
and
saluted
and
i
saw
beneath
a
disreputable
cap
the
features
of
the
man
who
had
been
with
me
in
the
coolin
crevice
i
spoke
a
word
to
his
sergeant
who
fell
him
out
and
he
walked
a
bit
of
the
way
with
me
scot
wake
what
brought
you
here
i
asked
thing
as
brought
you
this
rotten
war
i
had
dismounted
and
was
walking
beside
him
and
i
noticed
that
his
lean
face
had
lost
its
pallor
and
that
his
eyes
were
less
hot
than
they
used
to
be
seem
to
thrive
on
it
i
said
for
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
a
sudden
shyness
possessed
me
wake
must
have
gone
through
some
violent
cyclones
of
feeling
before
it
came
to
this
he
saw
what
i
was
thinking
and
laughed
in
his
sharp
ironical
way
flatter
yourself
you
made
a
convert
i
think
as
i
always
thought
but
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
since
the
fates
had
made
me
a
government
servant
i
might
as
well
do
my
work
somewhere
less
cushioned
than
a
chair
in
the
home
office
oh
no
it
was
a
matter
of
principle
one
kind
of
work
as
good
as
another
and
i
a
better
clerk
than
a
navvy
with
me
it
was
i
wanted
fresh
air
and
exercise
i
looked
at
him
mud
to
the
waist
and
his
hands
all
blistered
and
cut
with
unaccustomed
labour
i
could
realize
what
his
associates
must
mean
to
him
and
how
he
would
relish
the
rough
tonguing
of
a
confounded
humbug
i
said
on
earth
did
you
go
into
an
and
come
out
with
a
commission
they
easy
enough
to
get
mistake
my
case
he
said
bitterly
experienced
no
sudden
conviction
about
the
justice
of
the
war
i
stand
where
i
always
stood
i
a
and
i
wanted
a
change
of
civilian
work
no
it
was
any
idiotic
tribunal
sent
me
here
i
came
of
my
own
free
will
and
i
really
rather
enjoying
myself
a
rough
job
for
a
man
like
you
i
said
so
rough
as
the
fellows
get
in
the
trenches
i
watched
a
battalion
marching
back
today
and
they
looked
like
ghosts
who
had
been
years
in
muddy
graves
white
faces
and
dazed
eyes
and
leaden
feet
mine
a
cushy
job
i
like
it
best
when
the
weather
foul
it
cheats
me
into
thinking
i
doing
my
duty
i
nodded
towards
a
recent
of
that
sort
of
thing
and
then
we
had
a
good
dusting
this
morning
i
ca
say
i
liked
it
at
the
time
but
i
like
to
look
back
on
it
a
sort
of
moral
anodyne
wonder
what
on
earth
the
rest
of
your
lot
make
of
you
do
make
anything
i
not
remarkable
for
my
they
think
i
a
prig
which
i
am
it
does
amuse
me
to
talk
about
beer
and
women
or
listen
to
a
gramophone
or
grouse
about
my
last
meal
but
i
quite
content
thank
you
sometimes
i
get
a
seat
in
a
corner
of
a
hut
and
i
a
book
or
two
my
chief
affliction
is
the
padre
he
was
up
at
keble
in
my
time
and
as
one
of
my
colleagues
puts
it
wants
to
be
too
bloody
helpful
what
are
you
doing
hannay
i
see
you
some
kind
of
general
they
pretty
thick
on
the
ground
here
a
sort
of
general
soldiering
in
the
salient
is
the
softest
of
jobs
but
i
do
believe
it
as
tough
as
yours
is
for
you
know
wake
i
wish
i
had
you
in
my
brigade
trained
or
untrained
you
a
dashed
fellow
he
laughed
with
a
trifle
less
acidity
than
usual
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
combatant
no
thank
you
i
have
the
courage
and
besides
there
my
jolly
old
principles
all
the
same
i
like
to
be
near
you
you
a
good
chap
and
i
had
the
honour
to
assist
in
your
education
i
must
be
getting
back
or
the
sergeant
will
think
i
bolted
we
shook
hands
and
the
last
i
saw
of
him
was
a
figure
saluting
stiffly
in
the
wet
twilight
the
third
incident
was
trivial
enough
though
momentous
in
its
results
just
before
i
got
the
division
i
had
a
bout
of
malaria
we
were
in
support
in
the
salient
in
very
uncomfortable
trenches
behind
wieltje
and
i
spent
three
days
on
my
back
in
a
outside
was
a
blizzard
of
rain
and
the
water
now
and
then
came
down
the
stairs
through
the
gas
curtain
and
stood
in
pools
at
my
bed
foot
it
was
the
merriest
place
to
convalesce
in
but
i
was
as
hard
as
nails
at
the
time
and
by
the
third
day
i
was
beginning
to
sit
up
and
be
bored
i
read
all
my
english
papers
twice
and
a
big
stack
of
german
ones
which
i
used
to
have
sent
up
by
a
friend
in
the
intelligence
who
knew
i
liked
to
follow
what
the
boche
was
saying
as
i
dozed
and
ruminated
in
the
way
a
man
does
after
fever
i
was
struck
by
the
tremendous
display
of
one
advertisement
in
the
english
press
it
was
a
thing
called
system
which
according
to
its
promoter
was
a
cure
for
every
ill
mental
moral
or
physical
that
man
can
suffer
politicians
generals
admirals
and
artists
all
testified
to
the
new
life
it
had
opened
up
for
them
i
remember
wondering
what
these
sportsmen
got
for
their
testimonies
and
thinking
i
would
write
a
spoof
letter
myself
to
old
gussiter
then
i
picked
up
the
german
papers
and
suddenly
my
eye
caught
an
advertisement
of
the
same
kind
in
the
it
was
not
gussiter
this
time
but
one
weissmann
but
his
game
was
identical
breathing
the
hun
style
was
different
from
the
english
all
about
the
goddess
of
health
and
the
nymphs
of
the
mountains
and
two
quotations
from
schiller
but
the
principle
was
the
same
that
made
me
ponder
a
little
and
i
went
carefully
through
the
whole
batch
i
found
the
advertisement
in
the
and
in
one
or
two
rather
obscure
and
i
found
it
too
in
grosse
the
official
german
propagandist
they
were
the
same
all
but
one
and
that
one
had
a
bold
variation
for
it
contained
four
of
the
sentences
used
in
the
ordinary
english
advertisement
this
struck
me
as
fishy
and
i
started
to
write
a
letter
to
macgillivray
pointing
out
what
seemed
to
be
a
case
of
trading
with
the
enemy
and
advising
him
to
get
on
to
mr
gussiter
financial
backing
i
thought
he
might
find
a
hun
syndicate
behind
him
and
then
i
had
another
notion
which
made
me
rewrite
my
letter
i
went
through
the
papers
again
the
english
ones
which
contained
the
advertisement
were
all
good
solid
bellicose
organs
the
kind
of
thing
no
censorship
would
object
to
leaving
the
country
i
had
before
me
a
small
sheaf
of
pacifist
prints
and
they
had
not
the
advertisement
that
might
be
for
reasons
of
circulation
or
it
might
not
the
german
papers
were
either
radical
or
socialist
publications
just
the
opposite
of
the
english
lot
except
the
now
we
have
a
free
press
and
germany
has
strictly
speaking
none
all
her
journalistic
indiscretions
are
calculated
therefore
the
boche
has
no
objection
to
his
rags
getting
to
enemy
countries
he
wants
it
he
likes
to
see
them
quoted
in
columns
headed
german
glasses
and
made
the
text
of
articles
showing
what
a
good
democrat
he
is
becoming
as
i
puzzled
over
the
subject
certain
conclusions
began
to
form
in
my
mind
the
four
identical
sentences
seemed
to
hint
that
had
boche
affiliations
here
was
a
chance
of
communicating
with
the
enemy
which
would
defy
the
gentlemen
who
examine
the
mails
what
was
to
hinder
mr
a
at
one
end
writing
an
advertisement
with
a
good
cipher
in
it
and
the
paper
containing
it
getting
into
germany
by
holland
in
three
days
herr
b
at
the
other
end
replied
in
the
and
a
few
days
later
shrewd
editors
and
acute
intelligence
officers
and
mr
a
were
reading
it
in
london
though
only
mr
a
knew
what
it
really
meant
it
struck
me
as
a
bright
idea
the
sort
of
simple
thing
that
occur
to
clever
people
and
very
rarely
to
the
boche
i
wished
i
was
not
in
the
middle
of
a
battle
for
i
would
have
had
a
try
at
investigating
the
cipher
myself
i
wrote
a
long
letter
to
macgillivray
putting
my
case
and
then
went
to
sleep
when
i
awoke
i
reflected
that
it
was
a
pretty
thin
argument
and
would
have
stopped
the
letter
if
it
had
gone
off
early
by
a
ration
party
after
that
things
began
very
slowly
to
happen
the
first
was
when
hamilton
having
gone
to
boulogne
to
fetch
some
returned
with
the
startling
news
that
he
had
seen
gresson
he
had
not
heard
his
name
but
described
him
dramatically
to
me
as
the
wee
devil
that
kicked
ecky
brockie
knee
yon
time
in
glesca
sirr
i
recognized
the
description
gresson
it
appeared
was
he
was
with
a
party
of
labour
delegates
who
had
been
met
by
two
officers
and
carried
off
in
hamilton
reported
from
inquiries
among
his
friends
that
this
kind
of
visitor
came
weekly
i
thought
it
a
very
sensible
notion
on
the
government
part
but
i
wondered
how
gresson
had
been
selected
i
had
hoped
that
macgillivray
had
weeks
ago
made
a
long
arm
and
quodded
him
perhaps
they
had
too
little
evidence
to
hang
him
but
he
was
the
blackest
sort
of
suspect
and
should
have
been
interned
a
week
later
i
had
occasion
to
be
at
on
business
connected
with
my
new
division
my
friends
in
the
intelligence
allowed
me
to
use
the
direct
line
to
london
and
i
called
up
macgillivray
for
ten
minutes
i
had
an
exciting
talk
for
i
had
had
no
news
from
that
quarter
since
i
left
england
i
heard
that
the
portuguese
jew
had
escaped
had
vanished
from
his
native
heather
when
they
went
to
get
him
they
had
identified
him
as
a
german
professor
of
celtic
languages
who
had
held
a
chair
in
a
welsh
college
a
dangerous
fellow
for
he
was
an
upright
raging
fanatic
against
gresson
they
had
no
evidence
at
all
but
he
was
kept
under
strict
observation
when
i
asked
about
his
crossing
to
france
macgillivray
replied
that
that
was
part
of
their
scheme
i
inquired
if
the
visit
had
given
them
any
clues
but
i
never
got
an
answer
for
the
line
had
to
be
cleared
at
that
moment
for
the
war
office
i
hunted
up
the
man
who
had
charge
of
these
labour
visits
and
made
friends
with
him
gresson
he
said
had
been
a
quiet
and
most
appreciative
guest
he
had
wept
tears
on
vimy
ridge
and
strictly
against
orders
had
made
a
speech
to
some
troops
he
met
on
the
arras
road
about
how
british
labour
was
remembering
the
army
in
its
prayers
and
sweating
blood
to
make
guns
on
the
last
day
he
had
had
a
misadventure
for
he
got
very
sick
on
the
road
some
kidney
trouble
that
could
stand
the
jolting
of
the
car
and
had
to
be
left
at
a
village
and
picked
up
by
the
party
on
its
way
back
they
found
him
better
but
still
shaky
i
the
particular
officer
in
charge
about
that
halt
and
learned
that
gresson
had
been
left
alone
in
a
peasant
cottage
for
he
said
he
only
needed
to
lie
down
the
place
was
the
hamlet
of
eaucourt
for
several
weeks
that
name
stuck
in
my
head
it
had
a
pleasant
quaint
sound
and
i
wondered
how
gresson
had
spent
his
hours
there
i
hunted
it
up
on
the
map
and
promised
myself
to
have
a
look
at
it
the
next
time
we
came
out
to
rest
and
then
i
forgot
about
it
till
i
heard
the
name
mentioned
again
on
october
i
had
the
bad
luck
during
a
tour
of
my
trenches
to
stop
a
small
with
my
head
it
was
a
close
misty
day
and
i
had
taken
off
my
tin
hat
to
wipe
my
brow
when
the
thing
happened
i
got
a
long
shallow
scalp
wound
which
meant
nothing
but
bled
a
lot
and
as
we
were
not
in
for
any
big
move
the
sent
me
back
to
a
clearing
station
to
have
it
seen
to
i
was
three
days
in
the
place
and
being
perfectly
well
had
leisure
to
look
about
me
and
reflect
so
that
i
recall
that
time
as
a
queer
restful
interlude
in
the
infernal
racket
of
war
i
remember
yet
how
on
my
last
night
there
a
gale
made
the
lamps
swing
and
flicker
and
turned
the
canvas
walls
into
a
mass
of
mottled
shadows
the
floor
canvas
was
muddy
from
the
tramping
of
many
feet
bringing
in
the
constant
dribble
of
casualties
from
the
line
in
my
tent
there
was
no
one
very
bad
at
the
time
except
a
boy
with
his
shoulder
off
by
a
who
lay
in
a
drugged
sleep
at
the
far
end
the
majority
were
influenza
bronchitis
and
waiting
to
be
moved
to
the
base
or
convalescent
and
about
to
return
to
their
units
a
small
group
of
us
dined
off
tinned
chicken
stewed
fruit
and
radon
cheese
round
the
smoky
stove
where
two
screens
manufactured
from
packing
cases
gave
some
protection
against
the
draughts
which
swept
like
young
tornadoes
down
the
tent
one
man
had
been
reading
a
book
called
the
stories
of
an
and
the
talk
turned
on
the
unexplainable
things
that
happen
to
everybody
once
or
twice
in
a
lifetime
i
contributed
a
yarn
about
the
men
who
went
to
look
for
kruger
treasure
in
the
bushveld
and
got
scared
by
a
green
wildebeeste
it
is
a
good
yarn
and
i
write
it
down
some
day
a
tall
highlander
who
kept
his
slippered
feet
on
the
top
of
the
stove
and
whose
costume
consisted
of
a
kilt
a
british
warm
a
grey
hospital
and
four
pairs
of
socks
told
the
story
of
the
camerons
at
first
ypres
and
of
the
lowland
subaltern
who
knew
no
gaelic
and
suddenly
found
himself
encouraging
his
men
with
some
ancient
highland
rigmarole
the
poor
chap
had
a
racking
bronchial
cough
which
suggested
that
his
country
might
well
use
him
on
some
warmer
than
flanders
he
seemed
a
bit
of
a
scholar
and
explained
the
cameron
business
in
a
lot
of
long
words
i
remember
how
the
talk
meandered
on
as
talk
does
when
men
are
idle
and
thinking
about
the
next
day
i
did
pay
much
attention
for
i
was
reflecting
on
a
change
i
meant
to
make
in
one
of
my
battalion
commands
when
a
fresh
voice
broke
in
it
belonged
to
a
canadian
captain
from
winnipeg
a
very
silent
fellow
who
smoked
shag
tobacco
a
lot
of
ghosts
in
this
darned
country
he
said
then
he
started
to
tell
about
what
happened
to
him
when
his
division
was
last
back
in
rest
billets
he
had
a
staff
job
and
put
up
with
the
divisional
command
at
an
old
french
chateau
they
had
only
a
little
bit
of
the
house
the
rest
was
shut
up
but
the
passages
were
so
tortuous
that
it
was
difficult
to
keep
from
wandering
into
the
unoccupied
part
one
night
he
said
he
woke
with
a
mighty
thirst
and
since
he
going
to
get
cholera
by
drinking
the
local
water
in
his
bedroom
he
started
out
for
the
room
they
messed
in
to
try
to
pick
up
a
he
could
find
it
though
he
knew
the
road
like
his
own
name
he
admitted
he
might
have
taken
a
wrong
turning
but
he
did
think
so
anyway
he
landed
in
a
passage
which
he
had
never
seen
before
and
since
he
had
no
candle
he
tried
to
retrace
his
steps
again
he
went
wrong
and
groped
on
till
he
saw
a
faint
light
which
he
thought
must
be
the
room
of
the
a
good
fellow
and
a
friend
of
his
so
he
barged
in
and
found
a
big
dim
salon
with
two
figures
in
it
and
a
lamp
burning
between
them
and
a
queer
unpleasant
smell
about
he
took
a
step
forward
and
then
he
saw
that
the
figures
had
no
faces
that
fairly
loosened
his
joints
with
fear
and
he
gave
a
cry
one
of
the
two
ran
towards
him
the
lamp
went
out
and
the
sickly
scent
caught
suddenly
at
his
throat
after
that
he
knew
nothing
till
he
awoke
in
his
own
bed
next
morning
with
a
splitting
headache
he
said
he
got
the
general
permission
and
went
over
all
the
unoccupied
part
of
the
house
but
he
could
find
the
room
dust
lay
thick
on
everything
and
there
was
no
sign
of
recent
human
presence
i
give
the
story
as
he
told
it
in
his
drawling
voice
reckon
that
was
the
genuine
article
in
ghosts
you
do
believe
me
and
conclude
i
was
drunk
i
was
there
is
any
drink
concocted
yet
that
could
lay
me
out
like
that
i
just
struck
a
crack
in
the
old
universe
and
pushed
my
head
outside
it
may
happen
to
you
boys
any
day
the
highlander
began
to
argue
with
him
and
i
lost
interest
in
the
talk
but
one
phrase
brought
me
to
attention
give
you
the
name
of
the
darned
place
and
next
time
you
around
you
can
do
a
bit
of
prospecting
for
yourself
it
called
the
chateau
of
eaucourt
about
seven
kilometres
from
douvecourt
if
i
was
purchasing
real
estate
in
this
country
i
guess
i
give
that
location
a
miss
after
that
i
had
a
grim
month
what
with
the
finish
of
third
ypres
and
the
hustles
to
cambrai
by
the
middle
of
december
we
had
shaken
down
a
bit
but
the
line
my
division
held
was
not
of
our
choosing
and
we
had
to
keep
a
wary
eye
on
the
boche
doings
it
was
a
weary
job
and
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
anything
but
the
military
kind
of
intelligence
fixing
the
units
against
us
from
prisoners
stories
organizing
small
raids
and
keeping
the
royal
flying
corps
busy
i
was
keen
about
the
last
and
i
made
several
trips
myself
over
the
lines
with
archie
roylance
who
had
got
his
heart
desire
and
by
good
luck
belonged
to
the
squadron
just
behind
me
i
said
as
little
as
possible
about
this
for
did
not
encourage
divisional
generals
to
practise
such
methods
though
there
was
one
famous
army
commander
who
made
a
hobby
of
them
it
was
on
one
of
these
trips
that
an
incident
occurred
which
brought
my
spell
of
waiting
on
the
bigger
game
to
an
end
one
dull
december
day
just
after
luncheon
archie
and
i
set
out
to
reconnoitre
you
know
the
way
that
fogs
in
picardy
seem
suddenly
to
reek
out
of
the
ground
and
envelop
the
slopes
like
a
shawl
that
was
our
luck
this
time
we
had
crossed
the
lines
flying
very
high
and
received
the
usual
salute
of
hun
archies
after
a
mile
or
two
the
ground
seemed
to
climb
up
to
us
though
we
had
descended
and
presently
we
were
in
the
heart
of
a
cold
clinging
mist
we
dived
for
several
thousand
feet
but
the
confounded
thing
grew
thicker
and
no
sort
of
landmark
could
be
found
anywhere
i
thought
if
we
went
on
at
this
rate
we
should
hit
a
tree
or
a
church
steeple
and
be
easy
fruit
for
the
enemy
the
same
thought
must
have
been
in
archie
mind
for
he
climbed
again
we
got
into
a
mortally
cold
zone
but
the
air
was
no
clearer
thereupon
he
decided
to
head
for
home
and
passed
me
word
to
work
out
a
compass
course
on
the
map
that
was
easier
said
than
done
but
i
had
a
rough
notion
of
the
rate
we
had
travelled
since
we
had
crossed
the
lines
and
i
knew
our
original
direction
so
i
did
the
best
i
could
on
we
went
for
a
bit
and
then
i
began
to
get
doubtful
so
did
archie
we
dropped
low
down
but
we
could
hear
none
of
the
row
that
always
going
on
for
a
mile
on
each
side
of
the
lines
the
world
was
very
eerie
and
deadly
still
so
still
that
archie
and
i
could
talk
through
the
mislaid
this
blamed
battle
shouted
think
your
rotten
old
compass
has
soured
on
us
i
replied
we
decided
that
it
would
do
to
change
direction
so
we
held
on
the
same
course
i
was
getting
as
nervous
as
a
kitten
chiefly
owing
to
the
silence
it
not
what
you
expect
in
the
middle
of
a
i
looked
at
the
compass
carefully
and
saw
that
it
was
really
crocked
archie
must
have
damaged
it
on
a
former
flight
and
forgotten
to
have
it
changed
he
had
a
very
scared
face
when
i
pointed
this
out
god
he
croaked
for
he
had
a
fearsome
cold
either
about
calais
or
near
paris
or
miles
the
wrong
side
of
the
boche
line
what
the
devil
are
we
to
do
and
then
to
put
the
lid
on
it
his
engine
went
wrong
it
was
the
same
performance
as
on
the
yorkshire
moors
and
seemed
to
be
a
speciality
of
the
type
but
this
time
the
end
came
quick
we
dived
steeply
and
i
could
see
by
archie
grip
on
the
stick
that
he
was
going
to
have
his
work
cut
out
to
save
our
necks
save
them
he
did
but
not
by
much
for
we
jolted
down
on
the
edge
of
a
ploughed
field
with
a
series
of
bumps
that
shook
the
teeth
in
my
head
it
was
the
same
dense
dripping
fog
and
we
crawled
out
of
the
old
bus
and
bolted
for
cover
like
two
ferreted
rabbits
our
refuge
was
the
lee
of
a
small
copse
my
opinion
said
archie
solemnly
we
somewhere
about
la
cateau
tim
wilbraham
got
left
there
in
the
retreat
and
it
took
him
nine
months
to
make
the
dutch
frontier
it
a
giddy
prospect
sir
i
sallied
out
to
reconnoitre
at
the
other
side
of
the
wood
was
a
highway
and
the
fog
so
blanketed
sound
that
i
could
not
hear
a
man
on
it
till
i
saw
his
face
the
first
one
i
saw
made
me
lie
flat
in
the
covert
for
he
was
a
german
soldier
forage
cap
red
band
and
all
and
he
had
a
pick
on
his
shoulder
a
second
reflection
showed
me
that
this
was
not
final
proof
he
might
be
one
of
our
prisoners
but
it
was
no
place
to
take
chances
i
went
back
to
archie
and
the
pair
of
us
crossed
the
ploughed
field
and
struck
the
road
farther
on
there
we
saw
a
farmer
cart
with
a
woman
and
child
in
it
they
looked
french
but
melancholy
just
what
you
would
expect
from
the
inhabitants
of
a
countryside
in
enemy
occupation
then
we
came
to
the
park
wall
of
a
great
house
and
saw
dimly
the
outlines
of
a
cottage
here
sooner
or
later
we
would
get
proof
of
our
whereabouts
so
we
lay
and
shivered
among
the
poplars
of
the
roadside
no
one
seemed
abroad
that
afternoon
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
as
quiet
as
the
grave
then
came
a
sound
of
whistling
and
muffled
steps
an
englishman
said
archie
joyfully
boche
could
make
such
a
beastly
noise
he
was
right
the
form
of
an
army
service
corps
private
emerged
from
the
mist
his
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
walk
the
walk
of
a
free
man
i
never
saw
a
welcomer
sight
than
that
we
stood
up
and
greeted
him
this
place
i
shouted
he
raised
a
grubby
hand
to
his
forelock
saint
anny
sir
he
said
pardon
sir
but
you
ai
whurt
sir
ten
minutes
later
i
was
having
tea
in
the
mess
of
an
workshop
while
archie
had
gone
to
the
nearest
signals
to
telephone
for
a
car
and
give
instructions
about
his
precious
bus
it
was
almost
dark
but
i
gulped
my
tea
and
hastened
out
into
the
thick
dusk
for
i
wanted
to
have
a
look
at
the
chateau
i
found
a
big
entrance
with
high
stone
pillars
but
the
iron
gates
were
locked
and
looked
as
if
they
had
not
been
opened
in
the
memory
of
man
knowing
the
way
of
such
places
i
hunted
for
the
side
entrance
and
found
a
muddy
road
which
led
to
the
back
of
the
house
the
front
was
evidently
towards
a
kind
of
park
at
the
back
was
a
nest
of
outbuildings
and
a
section
of
moat
which
looked
very
deep
and
black
in
the
winter
twilight
this
was
crossed
by
a
stone
bridge
with
a
door
at
the
end
of
it
clearly
the
chateau
was
not
being
used
for
billets
there
was
no
sign
of
the
british
soldier
there
was
no
sign
of
anything
human
i
crept
through
the
fog
as
noiselessly
as
if
i
trod
on
velvet
and
i
even
the
company
of
my
own
footsteps
i
remembered
the
canadian
ghost
story
and
concluded
i
would
be
imagining
the
same
sort
of
thing
if
i
lived
in
such
a
place
the
door
was
bolted
and
padlocked
i
turned
along
the
side
of
the
moat
hoping
to
reach
the
house
front
which
was
probably
modern
and
boasted
a
civilized
entrance
there
must
be
somebody
in
the
place
for
one
chimney
was
smoking
presently
the
moat
petered
out
and
gave
place
to
a
cobbled
causeway
but
a
wall
running
at
right
angles
with
the
house
blocked
my
way
i
had
half
a
mind
to
go
back
and
hammer
at
the
door
but
i
reflected
that
do
pay
visits
to
deserted
chateaux
at
night
without
a
reasonable
errand
i
should
look
a
fool
in
the
eyes
of
some
old
concierge
the
daylight
was
almost
gone
and
i
did
wish
to
go
groping
about
the
house
with
a
candle
but
i
wanted
to
see
what
was
beyond
the
wall
one
of
those
whims
that
beset
the
soberest
men
i
rolled
a
dissolute
to
the
foot
of
it
and
gingerly
balanced
myself
on
its
rotten
staves
this
gave
me
a
grip
on
the
flat
brick
top
and
i
pulled
myself
up
i
looked
down
on
a
little
courtyard
with
another
wall
beyond
it
which
shut
off
any
view
of
the
park
on
the
right
was
the
chateau
on
the
left
more
outbuildings
the
whole
place
was
not
more
than
twenty
yards
each
way
i
was
just
about
to
retire
by
the
road
i
had
come
for
in
spite
of
my
fur
coat
it
was
uncommon
chilly
on
that
perch
when
i
heard
a
key
turn
in
the
door
in
the
chateau
wall
beneath
me
a
lantern
made
a
blur
of
light
in
the
misty
darkness
i
saw
that
the
bearer
was
a
woman
an
oldish
woman
like
most
french
peasants
in
one
hand
she
carried
a
leather
bag
and
she
moved
so
silently
that
she
must
have
worn
rubber
boots
the
light
was
held
level
with
her
head
and
illumined
her
face
it
was
the
evillest
thing
i
have
ever
beheld
for
a
horrible
scar
had
puckered
the
skin
of
the
forehead
and
drawn
up
the
eyebrows
so
that
it
looked
like
some
diabolical
chinese
mask
slowly
she
padded
across
the
yard
carrying
the
bag
as
gingerly
as
if
it
had
been
an
infant
she
stopped
at
the
door
of
one
of
the
outhouses
and
set
down
the
lantern
and
her
burden
on
the
ground
from
her
apron
she
drew
something
which
looked
like
a
and
put
it
over
her
head
she
also
put
on
a
pair
of
long
gauntlets
then
she
unlocked
the
door
picked
up
the
lantern
and
went
in
i
heard
the
key
turn
behind
her
crouching
on
that
wall
i
felt
a
very
ugly
tremor
run
down
my
spine
i
had
a
glimpse
of
what
the
canadian
ghost
might
have
been
that
hag
hooded
like
some
venomous
snake
was
too
much
for
my
stomach
i
dropped
off
the
wall
and
ran
yes
ran
till
i
reached
the
highroad
and
saw
the
cheery
headlights
of
a
transport
wagon
and
heard
the
honest
speech
of
the
british
soldier
that
restored
me
to
my
senses
and
made
me
feel
every
kind
of
a
fool
as
i
drove
back
to
the
line
with
archie
i
was
black
ashamed
of
my
funk
i
told
myself
that
i
had
seen
only
an
old
countrywoman
going
to
feed
her
hens
i
convinced
my
reason
but
i
did
not
convince
the
whole
of
me
an
insensate
dread
of
the
place
hung
around
me
and
i
could
only
retrieve
my
by
resolving
to
return
and
explore
every
nook
of
it
chapter
thirteen
the
adventure
of
the
picardy
chateau
i
looked
up
eaucourt
on
the
map
and
the
more
i
studied
its
position
the
less
i
liked
it
it
was
the
knot
from
which
sprang
all
the
main
routes
to
our
picardy
front
if
the
boche
ever
broke
us
it
was
the
place
for
which
old
hindenburg
would
make
at
all
hours
troops
and
transport
trains
were
moving
through
that
insignificant
hamlet
eminent
generals
and
their
staffs
passed
daily
within
sight
of
the
chateau
it
was
a
convenient
for
battalions
coming
back
to
rest
supposing
i
argued
our
enemies
wanted
a
for
some
assault
upon
the
morale
or
the
discipline
or
health
of
the
british
army
they
could
find
a
better
than
eaucourt
it
was
the
ideal
centre
of
espionage
but
when
i
guardedly
sounded
my
friends
of
the
intelligence
they
did
seem
to
be
worrying
about
it
from
them
i
got
a
chit
to
the
local
french
authorities
and
as
soon
as
we
came
out
of
the
line
towards
the
end
of
december
i
made
straight
for
the
country
town
of
douvecourt
by
a
bit
of
luck
our
divisional
quarters
were
almost
next
door
i
interviewed
a
tremendous
swell
in
a
black
uniform
and
black
kid
gloves
who
received
me
affably
and
put
his
archives
and
registers
at
my
disposal
by
this
time
i
talked
french
fairly
well
having
a
natural
turn
for
languages
but
half
the
rapid
speech
of
the
was
lost
on
me
by
and
by
he
left
me
with
the
papers
and
a
clerk
and
i
proceeded
to
grub
up
the
history
of
the
chateau
it
had
belonged
since
long
before
agincourt
to
the
noble
house
of
the
now
represented
by
an
ancient
marquise
who
dwelt
at
biarritz
she
had
never
lived
in
the
place
which
a
dozen
years
before
had
been
falling
to
ruins
when
a
rich
american
leased
it
and
partially
restored
it
he
had
soon
got
sick
of
it
his
daughter
had
married
a
blackguard
french
cavalry
officer
with
whom
he
quarrelled
said
the
clerk
and
since
then
there
had
been
several
tenants
i
wondered
why
a
house
so
unattractive
should
have
let
so
readily
but
the
clerk
explained
that
the
cause
was
the
it
was
about
the
best
in
france
and
in
had
shown
the
record
bag
the
list
of
the
tenants
was
before
me
there
was
a
second
american
an
englishman
called
halford
a
paris
and
an
egyptian
prince
but
the
space
for
was
blank
and
i
asked
the
clerk
about
it
he
told
me
that
it
had
been
taken
by
a
woollen
manufacturer
from
lille
but
he
had
never
shot
the
partridges
though
he
had
spent
occasional
nights
in
the
house
he
had
a
five
years
lease
and
was
still
paying
rent
to
the
marquise
i
asked
the
name
but
the
clerk
had
forgotten
will
be
written
there
he
said
no
i
said
must
have
been
asleep
over
this
register
there
nothing
after
he
examined
the
page
and
blinked
his
eyes
indeed
must
have
slept
no
doubt
it
was
young
louis
who
is
now
with
the
guns
in
champagne
but
the
name
will
be
on
the
commissary
list
it
is
as
i
remember
a
sort
of
flemish
he
hobbled
off
and
returned
in
five
minutes
he
said
bommaerts
a
young
man
with
no
wife
but
with
money
dieu
de
dieu
what
oceans
of
it
that
clerk
got
francs
and
he
was
cheap
at
the
price
i
went
back
to
my
division
with
a
sense
of
awe
on
me
it
was
a
marvellous
fate
that
had
brought
me
by
odd
routes
to
this
corner
first
the
accident
of
hamilton
seeing
gresson
then
the
night
in
the
clearing
station
last
the
mishap
of
archie
plane
getting
lost
in
the
fog
i
had
three
grounds
of
suspicion
gresson
sudden
illness
the
canadian
ghost
and
that
horrid
old
woman
in
the
dusk
and
now
i
had
one
tremendous
fact
the
place
was
leased
by
a
man
called
bommaerts
and
that
was
one
of
the
two
names
i
had
heard
whispered
in
that
cleft
in
the
coolin
by
the
stranger
from
the
sea
a
sensible
man
would
have
gone
off
to
the
people
and
told
them
his
story
i
could
do
this
i
felt
that
it
was
my
own
private
find
and
i
was
going
to
do
the
prospecting
myself
every
moment
of
leisure
i
had
i
was
puzzling
over
the
thing
i
rode
round
by
the
chateau
one
frosty
morning
and
examined
all
the
entrances
the
main
one
was
the
grand
avenue
with
the
locked
gates
that
led
straight
to
the
front
of
the
house
where
the
terrace
was
or
you
might
call
it
the
back
for
the
main
door
was
on
the
other
side
anyhow
the
drive
came
up
to
the
edge
of
the
terrace
and
then
split
into
two
one
branch
going
to
the
stables
by
way
of
the
outbuildings
where
i
had
seen
the
old
woman
the
other
circling
round
the
house
skirting
the
moat
and
joining
the
back
road
just
before
the
bridge
if
i
had
gone
to
the
right
instead
of
the
left
that
first
evening
with
archie
i
should
have
circumnavigated
the
place
without
any
trouble
seen
in
the
fresh
morning
light
the
house
looked
commonplace
enough
part
of
it
was
as
old
as
noah
but
most
was
newish
and
the
kind
of
thin
french
chateau
all
front
and
no
depth
and
full
of
draughts
and
smoky
chimneys
i
might
have
gone
in
and
ransacked
the
place
but
i
knew
i
should
find
nothing
it
was
borne
in
on
me
that
it
was
only
when
evening
fell
that
that
house
was
interesting
and
that
i
must
come
like
nicodemus
by
night
besides
i
had
a
private
account
to
settle
with
my
conscience
i
had
funked
the
place
in
the
foggy
twilight
and
it
does
not
do
to
let
a
matter
like
that
slide
a
courage
is
like
a
horse
that
refuses
a
fence
you
have
got
to
take
him
by
the
head
and
cram
him
at
it
again
if
you
do
he
will
funk
worse
next
time
i
had
enough
courage
to
be
able
to
take
chances
with
it
though
i
was
afraid
of
many
things
the
thing
i
feared
most
mortally
was
being
afraid
i
did
not
get
a
chance
till
christmas
eve
the
day
before
there
had
been
a
fall
of
snow
but
the
frost
set
in
and
the
afternoon
ended
in
a
green
sunset
with
the
earth
crisp
and
crackling
like
a
shark
skin
i
dined
early
and
took
with
me
geordie
hamilton
who
added
to
his
many
accomplishments
that
of
driving
a
car
he
was
the
only
man
in
the
who
guessed
anything
of
the
game
i
was
after
and
i
knew
that
he
was
as
discreet
as
a
tombstone
i
put
on
my
oldest
trench
cap
slacks
and
a
pair
of
boots
that
i
used
to
change
into
in
the
evening
i
had
a
useful
little
electric
torch
which
lived
in
my
pocket
and
from
which
a
cord
led
to
a
small
bulb
of
light
that
worked
with
a
switch
and
could
be
hung
on
my
belt
that
left
my
arms
free
in
case
of
emergencies
likewise
i
strapped
on
my
pistol
there
was
little
traffic
in
the
hamlet
of
eaucourt
that
night
few
cars
were
on
the
road
and
the
detachment
judging
from
the
din
seemed
to
be
busy
on
a
private
spree
it
was
about
nine
when
we
turned
into
the
side
road
and
at
the
entrance
to
it
i
saw
a
solid
figure
in
khaki
mounting
guard
beside
two
bicycles
something
in
the
man
gesture
as
he
saluted
struck
me
as
familiar
but
i
had
no
time
to
hunt
for
casual
memories
i
left
the
car
just
short
of
the
bridge
and
took
the
road
which
would
bring
me
to
the
terraced
front
of
the
house
once
i
turned
the
corner
of
the
chateau
and
saw
the
long
ghostly
facade
white
in
the
moonlight
i
felt
less
confident
the
eeriness
of
the
place
smote
me
in
that
still
snowy
world
it
loomed
up
immense
and
mysterious
with
its
rows
of
shuttered
windows
each
with
that
air
which
empty
houses
have
of
concealing
some
wild
story
i
longed
to
have
old
peter
with
me
for
he
was
the
man
for
this
kind
of
escapade
i
had
heard
that
he
had
been
removed
to
switzerland
and
i
pictured
him
now
in
some
mountain
village
where
the
snow
lay
deep
i
would
have
given
anything
to
have
had
peter
with
a
whole
leg
by
my
side
i
stepped
on
the
terrace
and
listened
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
world
not
even
the
distant
rumble
of
a
cart
the
pile
towered
above
me
like
a
mausoleum
and
i
reflected
that
it
must
take
some
nerve
to
burgle
an
empty
house
it
would
be
good
enough
fun
to
break
into
a
bustling
dwelling
and
pinch
the
plate
when
the
folk
were
at
dinner
but
to
burgle
emptiness
and
silence
meant
a
fight
with
the
terrors
in
a
man
soul
it
was
worse
in
my
case
for
i
was
cheered
with
prospects
of
loot
i
wanted
to
get
inside
chiefly
to
soothe
my
conscience
i
had
much
doubt
i
would
find
a
way
for
three
years
of
war
and
the
frequent
presence
of
untidy
headquarters
staffs
have
loosened
the
joints
of
most
picardy
houses
there
generally
a
window
that
latch
or
a
door
that
does
bar
but
i
tried
window
after
window
on
the
terrace
without
result
the
heavy
green
were
down
over
each
and
when
i
broke
the
hinges
of
one
there
was
a
long
bar
within
to
hold
it
firm
i
was
beginning
to
think
of
shinning
up
a
and
trying
the
second
floor
when
a
shutter
i
had
laid
hold
on
swung
back
in
my
hand
it
had
been
left
unfastened
and
kicking
the
snow
from
my
boots
i
entered
a
room
a
gleam
of
moonlight
followed
me
and
i
saw
i
was
in
a
big
salon
with
a
polished
wood
floor
and
dark
lumps
of
furniture
swathed
in
sheets
i
clicked
the
bulb
at
my
belt
and
the
little
circle
of
light
showed
a
place
which
had
not
been
dwelt
in
for
years
at
the
far
end
was
another
door
and
as
i
tiptoed
towards
it
something
caught
my
eye
on
the
parquet
it
was
a
piece
of
fresh
snow
like
that
which
clumps
on
the
heel
of
a
boot
i
had
not
brought
it
there
some
other
visitor
had
passed
this
way
and
not
long
before
me
very
gently
i
opened
the
door
and
slipped
in
in
front
of
me
was
a
pile
of
furniture
which
made
a
kind
of
screen
and
behind
that
i
halted
and
listened
there
was
somebody
in
the
room
i
heard
the
sound
of
human
breathing
and
soft
movements
the
man
whoever
he
was
was
at
the
far
end
from
me
and
though
there
was
a
dim
glow
of
moon
through
a
broken
shutter
i
could
see
nothing
of
what
he
was
after
i
was
beginning
to
enjoy
myself
now
i
knew
of
his
presence
and
he
did
not
know
of
mine
and
that
is
the
sport
of
stalking
an
unwary
movement
of
my
hand
caused
the
screen
to
creak
instantly
the
movements
ceased
and
there
was
utter
silence
i
held
my
breath
and
after
a
second
or
two
the
tiny
sounds
began
again
i
had
a
feeling
though
my
eyes
could
not
assure
me
that
the
man
before
me
was
at
work
and
was
using
a
very
small
shaded
torch
there
was
just
the
faintest
moving
shimmer
on
the
wall
beyond
though
that
might
come
from
the
crack
of
moonlight
apparently
he
was
reassured
for
his
movements
became
more
distinct
there
was
a
jar
as
if
a
table
had
been
pushed
back
once
more
there
was
silence
and
i
heard
only
the
intake
of
breath
i
have
very
quick
ears
and
to
me
it
sounded
as
if
the
man
was
rattled
the
breathing
was
quick
and
anxious
suddenly
it
changed
and
became
the
ghost
of
a
whistle
the
kind
of
sound
one
makes
with
the
lips
and
teeth
without
ever
letting
the
tune
break
out
clear
we
all
do
it
when
we
are
preoccupied
with
something
shaving
or
writing
letters
or
reading
the
newspaper
but
i
did
not
think
my
man
was
preoccupied
he
was
whistling
to
quiet
fluttering
nerves
then
i
caught
the
air
it
was
ripe
in
a
moment
from
being
hugely
at
my
ease
i
became
the
nervous
one
i
had
been
playing
with
the
unseen
and
the
tables
were
turned
my
heart
beat
against
my
ribs
like
a
hammer
i
shuffled
my
feet
and
again
there
fell
the
tense
silence
i
said
and
the
word
seemed
to
explode
like
a
bomb
in
the
stillness
it
me
dick
hannay
there
was
no
answer
but
a
sob
and
the
sound
of
a
timid
step
i
took
four
paces
into
the
darkness
and
caught
in
my
arms
a
trembling
girl
often
in
the
last
months
i
had
pictured
the
kind
of
scene
which
would
be
the
culminating
point
of
my
life
when
our
work
was
over
and
war
had
been
forgotten
somewhere
perhaps
in
a
green
cotswold
meadow
or
in
a
room
of
an
old
manor
i
would
talk
with
mary
by
that
time
we
should
know
each
other
well
and
i
would
have
lost
my
shyness
i
would
try
to
tell
her
that
i
loved
her
but
whenever
i
thought
of
what
i
should
say
my
heart
sank
for
i
knew
i
would
make
a
fool
of
myself
you
ca
live
my
kind
of
life
for
forty
years
wholly
among
men
and
be
of
any
use
at
pretty
speeches
to
women
i
knew
i
should
stutter
and
blunder
and
i
used
despairingly
to
invent
impossible
situations
where
i
might
make
my
love
plain
to
her
without
words
by
some
piece
of
melodramatic
sacrifice
but
the
kind
fates
had
saved
me
the
trouble
without
a
syllable
save
christian
names
stammered
in
that
eerie
darkness
we
had
come
to
complete
understanding
the
fairies
had
been
at
work
unseen
and
the
thoughts
of
each
of
us
had
been
moving
towards
the
other
till
love
had
germinated
like
a
seed
in
the
dark
as
i
held
her
in
my
arms
i
stroked
her
hair
and
murmured
things
which
seemed
to
spring
out
of
some
ancestral
memory
certainly
my
tongue
had
never
used
them
before
nor
my
mind
imagined
them
by
and
by
she
slipped
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
with
a
half
sob
strained
towards
me
she
was
still
trembling
she
said
and
to
hear
that
name
on
her
lips
was
the
sweetest
thing
i
had
ever
known
is
it
really
you
tell
me
i
not
dreaming
me
sure
enough
mary
dear
and
now
i
have
found
you
i
will
never
let
you
go
again
but
my
precious
child
how
on
earth
did
you
get
here
she
disengaged
herself
and
let
her
little
electric
torch
wander
over
my
rough
habiliments
look
a
tremendous
warrior
dick
i
have
never
seen
you
like
this
before
i
was
in
doubting
castle
and
very
much
afraid
of
giant
despair
till
you
came
think
i
call
it
the
interpreter
house
i
said
the
house
of
somebody
we
both
know
she
went
on
calls
himself
bommaerts
here
that
was
one
of
the
two
names
you
remember
i
have
seen
him
since
in
paris
oh
it
is
a
long
story
and
you
shall
hear
it
all
soon
i
knew
he
came
here
sometimes
so
i
came
here
too
i
have
been
nursing
for
the
last
fortnight
at
the
douvecourt
hospital
only
four
miles
away
what
brought
you
alone
at
night
i
think
vanity
too
you
see
i
had
found
out
a
good
deal
and
i
wanted
to
find
out
the
one
vital
thing
which
had
puzzled
mr
blenkiron
i
told
myself
it
was
foolish
but
i
could
keep
away
and
then
my
courage
broke
down
and
before
you
came
i
would
have
screamed
at
the
sound
of
a
mouse
if
i
had
whistled
i
would
have
cried
why
alone
and
at
this
hour
could
get
off
in
the
day
and
it
was
safest
to
come
alone
you
see
he
is
in
love
with
me
and
when
he
heard
i
was
coming
to
douvecourt
forgot
his
caution
and
proposed
to
meet
me
here
he
said
he
was
going
on
a
long
journey
and
wanted
to
say
goodbye
if
he
had
found
me
alone
well
he
would
have
said
goodbye
if
there
had
been
anyone
with
me
he
would
have
suspected
and
he
must
suspect
me
mr
blenkiron
says
that
would
be
fatal
to
his
great
plan
he
believes
i
am
like
my
aunts
and
that
i
think
him
an
apostle
of
peace
working
by
his
own
methods
against
the
stupidity
and
wickedness
of
all
the
governments
he
talks
more
bitterly
about
germany
than
about
england
he
had
told
me
how
he
had
to
disguise
himself
and
play
many
parts
on
his
mission
and
of
course
i
have
applauded
him
oh
i
have
had
a
difficult
autumn
i
cried
me
you
hate
him
she
said
quietly
do
not
hate
him
i
am
keeping
that
for
later
i
fear
him
desperately
some
day
when
we
have
broken
him
utterly
i
will
hate
him
and
drive
all
likeness
of
him
out
of
my
memory
like
an
unclean
thing
but
till
then
i
wo
waste
energy
on
hate
we
want
to
hoard
every
atom
of
our
strength
for
the
work
of
beating
him
she
had
won
back
her
composure
and
i
turned
on
my
light
to
look
at
her
she
was
in
nurses
outdoor
uniform
and
i
thought
her
eyes
seemed
tired
the
priceless
gift
that
had
suddenly
come
to
me
had
driven
out
all
recollection
of
my
own
errand
i
thought
of
ivery
only
as
a
lover
of
mary
and
forgot
the
manufacturer
from
lille
who
had
rented
his
house
for
the
you
dick
she
asked
it
part
of
a
general
duties
to
pay
visits
at
night
to
empty
houses
came
to
look
for
traces
of
bommaerts
i
too
got
on
his
track
from
another
angle
but
that
story
must
wait
observe
that
he
has
been
here
today
she
pointed
to
some
cigarette
ash
spilled
on
the
table
edge
and
a
space
on
its
surface
cleared
from
dust
a
place
like
this
the
dust
would
settle
again
in
a
few
hours
and
that
is
quite
clean
i
should
say
he
has
been
here
just
after
luncheon
scott
i
cried
a
close
shave
i
in
the
mood
at
this
moment
to
shoot
him
at
sight
you
say
you
saw
him
in
paris
and
knew
his
lair
surely
you
had
a
good
enough
case
to
have
him
collared
she
shook
her
head
blenkiron
he
in
paris
too
would
hear
of
it
he
has
just
figured
the
thing
out
yet
he
says
we
identified
one
of
your
names
but
we
still
in
doubt
about
chelius
chelius
yes
i
see
we
must
get
the
whole
business
complete
before
we
strike
has
old
blenkiron
had
any
luck
guess
about
the
advertisement
was
very
clever
dick
it
was
true
and
it
may
give
us
chelius
i
must
leave
mr
blenkiron
to
tell
you
how
but
the
trouble
is
this
we
know
something
of
the
doings
of
someone
who
may
be
chelius
but
we
ca
link
them
with
ivery
we
know
that
ivery
is
bommaerts
and
our
hope
is
to
link
bommaerts
with
chelius
that
why
i
came
here
i
was
trying
to
burgle
this
escritoire
in
an
amateur
way
it
a
bad
piece
of
fake
empire
and
deserves
smashing
i
could
see
that
mary
was
eager
to
get
my
mind
back
to
business
and
with
some
difficulty
i
clambered
down
from
the
exultant
heights
the
intoxication
of
the
thing
was
on
me
the
winter
night
the
circle
of
light
in
that
dreary
room
the
sudden
coming
together
of
two
souls
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
the
realization
of
my
wildest
hopes
the
gilding
and
glorifying
of
all
the
future
but
she
had
always
twice
as
much
wisdom
as
me
and
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
campaign
which
had
no
use
for
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
desk
it
was
a
flat
table
with
drawers
and
at
the
back
a
of
more
drawers
with
a
central
cupboard
i
tilted
it
up
and
most
of
the
drawers
slid
out
empty
of
anything
but
dust
i
forced
two
open
with
my
knife
and
they
held
empty
cigar
boxes
only
the
cupboard
remained
and
that
appeared
to
be
locked
i
wedged
a
key
from
my
pocket
into
its
keyhole
but
the
thing
would
not
budge
no
good
i
said
would
leave
anything
he
valued
in
a
place
like
this
that
sort
of
fellow
does
take
risks
if
he
wanted
to
hide
something
there
are
a
hundred
holes
in
this
chateau
which
would
puzzle
the
best
detective
you
open
it
she
asked
a
fancy
about
that
table
he
was
sitting
here
this
afternoon
and
he
may
be
coming
back
i
solved
the
problem
by
turning
up
the
escritoire
and
putting
my
knee
through
the
cupboard
door
out
of
it
tumbled
a
little
attache
case
is
getting
solemn
said
mary
it
locked
it
was
but
i
took
my
knife
and
cut
the
lock
out
and
spilled
the
contents
on
the
table
there
were
some
papers
a
newspaper
or
two
and
a
small
bag
tied
with
black
cord
the
last
i
opened
while
mary
looked
over
my
shoulder
it
contained
a
fine
yellowish
powder
back
i
said
harshly
god
sake
stand
back
and
breathe
with
trembling
hands
i
tied
up
the
bag
again
rolled
it
in
a
newspaper
and
stuffed
it
into
my
pocket
for
i
remembered
a
day
near
peronne
when
a
boche
plane
had
come
over
in
the
night
and
had
dropped
little
bags
like
this
happily
they
were
all
collected
and
the
men
who
found
them
were
wise
and
took
them
off
to
the
nearest
laboratory
they
proved
to
be
full
of
anthrax
germs
i
remembered
how
eaucourt
stood
at
the
junction
of
a
dozen
roads
where
all
day
long
troops
passed
to
and
from
the
lines
from
such
a
vantage
ground
an
enemy
could
wreck
the
health
of
an
army
i
remembered
the
woman
i
had
seen
in
the
courtyard
of
this
house
in
the
foggy
dusk
and
i
knew
now
why
she
had
worn
a
this
discovery
gave
me
a
horrid
shock
i
was
brought
down
with
a
crash
from
my
high
sentiment
to
something
earthly
and
devilish
i
was
fairly
well
used
to
boche
filthiness
but
this
seemed
too
grim
a
piece
of
the
utterly
damnable
i
wanted
to
have
ivery
by
the
throat
and
force
the
stuff
into
his
body
and
watch
him
decay
slowly
into
the
horror
he
had
contrived
for
honest
men
get
out
of
this
infernal
place
i
said
but
mary
was
not
listening
she
had
picked
up
one
of
the
newspapers
and
was
gloating
over
it
i
looked
and
saw
that
it
was
open
at
an
advertisement
of
weissmann
system
look
dick
she
cried
breathlessly
the
column
of
type
had
little
dots
made
by
a
red
pencil
below
certain
words
it
she
whispered
the
cipher
i
almost
sure
it
the
cipher
he
be
likely
to
know
it
if
anyone
did
do
you
see
it
the
cipher
which
chelius
uses
the
man
in
switzerland
oh
i
ca
explain
now
for
it
very
long
but
i
think
i
think
i
have
found
out
what
we
have
all
been
wanting
chelius
i
said
that
there
was
a
queer
sound
from
the
as
if
a
sudden
wind
had
risen
in
the
still
night
only
a
car
on
the
main
road
said
mary
did
you
get
in
i
asked
the
broken
window
in
the
next
room
i
cycled
out
here
one
morning
and
walked
round
the
place
and
found
the
broken
catch
it
is
left
open
on
purpose
that
may
be
the
way
bommaerts
visits
his
country
home
let
get
off
mary
for
this
place
has
a
curse
on
it
it
deserves
fire
from
heaven
i
slipped
the
contents
of
the
attache
case
into
my
pockets
going
to
drive
you
back
i
said
got
a
car
out
there
you
must
take
my
bicycle
and
my
servant
too
he
an
old
friend
of
yours
one
andrew
amos
how
on
earth
did
andrew
get
over
here
one
of
us
said
mary
laughing
at
my
surprise
most
useful
member
of
our
party
at
present
disguised
as
an
in
lady
manorwater
hospital
at
douvecourt
he
is
learning
french
and
i
whispered
someone
in
the
next
room
i
swept
her
behind
a
stack
of
furniture
with
my
eyes
glued
on
a
crack
of
light
below
the
door
the
handle
turned
and
the
shadows
raced
before
a
big
electric
lamp
of
the
kind
they
have
in
stables
i
could
not
see
the
bearer
but
i
guessed
it
was
the
old
woman
there
was
a
man
behind
her
a
brisk
step
sounded
on
the
parquet
and
a
figure
brushed
past
her
it
wore
the
of
a
french
officer
very
smart
with
those
french
that
show
the
shape
of
the
leg
and
a
handsome
pelisse
i
would
have
called
him
a
young
man
not
more
than
the
face
was
brown
and
the
eyes
bright
and
masterful
yet
he
did
not
deceive
me
i
had
not
boasted
idly
to
sir
walter
when
i
said
that
there
was
one
man
alive
who
could
never
again
be
mistaken
by
me
i
had
my
hand
on
my
pistol
as
i
motioned
mary
farther
back
into
the
shadows
for
a
second
i
was
about
to
shoot
i
had
a
perfect
mark
and
could
have
put
a
bullet
through
his
brain
with
utter
certitude
i
think
if
i
had
been
alone
i
might
have
fired
perhaps
not
anyhow
now
i
could
not
do
it
it
seemed
like
potting
at
a
sitting
rabbit
i
was
obliged
though
he
was
my
worst
enemy
to
give
him
a
chance
while
all
the
while
my
sober
senses
kept
calling
me
a
fool
i
stepped
into
the
light
mr
ivery
i
said
is
an
odd
place
to
meet
again
in
his
amazement
he
fell
back
a
step
while
his
hungry
eyes
took
in
my
face
there
was
no
mistake
about
the
recognition
i
saw
something
i
had
seen
once
before
in
him
and
that
was
fear
out
went
the
light
and
he
sprang
for
the
door
i
fired
in
the
dark
but
the
shot
must
have
been
too
high
in
the
same
instant
i
heard
him
slip
on
the
smooth
parquet
and
the
tinkle
of
glass
as
the
broken
window
swung
open
hastily
i
reflected
that
his
car
must
be
at
the
moat
end
of
the
terrace
and
that
therefore
to
reach
it
he
must
pass
outside
this
very
room
seizing
the
damaged
escritoire
i
used
it
as
a
ram
and
charged
the
window
nearest
me
the
panes
and
shutters
went
with
a
crash
for
i
had
driven
the
thing
out
of
its
rotten
frame
the
next
second
i
was
on
the
moonlit
snow
i
got
a
shot
at
him
as
he
went
over
the
terrace
and
again
i
went
wide
i
never
was
at
my
best
with
a
pistol
still
i
reckoned
i
had
got
him
for
the
car
which
was
waiting
below
must
come
back
by
the
moat
to
reach
the
highroad
but
i
had
forgotten
the
great
closed
park
gates
somehow
or
other
they
must
have
been
opened
for
as
soon
as
the
car
started
it
headed
straight
for
the
grand
avenue
i
tried
a
couple
of
shots
after
it
and
one
must
have
damaged
either
ivery
or
his
chauffeur
for
there
came
back
a
cry
of
pain
i
turned
in
deep
chagrin
to
find
mary
beside
me
she
was
bubbling
with
laughter
you
ever
a
cinema
actor
dick
the
last
two
minutes
have
been
a
really
performance
featuring
mary
lamington
how
does
the
jargon
go
could
have
got
him
when
he
first
entered
i
said
ruefully
know
she
said
in
a
graver
tone
of
course
you
could
besides
mr
blenkiron
does
want
it
yet
she
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
worry
about
it
it
was
written
it
should
happen
that
way
it
would
have
been
too
easy
we
have
a
long
road
to
travel
yet
before
we
clip
the
wings
of
the
wild
birds
i
cried
fire
from
heaven
red
tongues
of
flame
were
shooting
up
from
the
at
the
farther
end
the
place
where
i
had
first
seen
the
woman
some
agreed
plan
must
have
been
acted
on
and
ivery
was
destroying
all
traces
of
his
infamous
yellow
powder
even
now
the
concierge
with
her
odds
and
ends
of
belongings
would
be
slipping
out
to
some
refuge
in
the
village
in
the
still
dry
night
the
flames
rose
for
the
place
must
have
been
made
ready
for
a
rapid
burning
as
i
hurried
mary
round
the
moat
i
could
see
that
part
of
the
main
building
had
caught
fire
the
hamlet
was
awakened
and
before
we
reached
the
corner
of
the
highroad
sleepy
british
soldiers
were
hurrying
towards
the
scene
and
the
town
major
was
mustering
the
fire
brigade
i
knew
that
ivery
had
laid
his
plans
well
and
that
they
had
a
chance
that
long
before
dawn
the
chateau
of
eaucourt
would
be
a
heap
of
ashes
and
that
in
a
day
or
two
the
lawyers
of
the
aged
marquise
at
biarritz
would
be
wrangling
with
the
insurance
company
at
the
corner
stood
amos
beside
two
bicycles
solid
as
a
graven
image
he
recognized
me
with
a
grin
a
cauld
night
general
but
the
home
fires
keep
burnin
i
havena
seen
such
a
cheery
lowe
since
dickson
mill
at
gawly
we
packed
bicycles
and
all
into
my
car
with
amos
wedged
in
the
narrow
seat
beside
hamilton
recognizing
a
fellow
countryman
he
gave
thanks
for
the
lift
in
the
broadest
doric
said
he
not
what
you
would
call
a
practised
hand
wi
a
velocipede
and
my
feet
are
dinnled
wi
standin
in
the
snaw
as
for
me
the
miles
to
douvecourt
passed
as
in
a
blissful
moment
of
time
i
wrapped
mary
in
a
fur
rug
and
after
that
we
did
not
speak
a
word
i
had
come
suddenly
into
a
great
possession
and
was
dazed
with
the
joy
of
it
chapter
fourteen
mr
blenkiron
discourses
on
love
and
war
three
days
later
i
got
my
orders
to
report
at
paris
for
special
service
they
came
none
too
soon
for
i
chafed
at
each
hour
delay
every
thought
in
my
head
was
directed
to
the
game
which
we
were
playing
against
ivery
he
was
the
big
enemy
compared
to
whom
the
ordinary
boche
in
the
trenches
was
innocent
and
friendly
i
had
almost
lost
interest
in
my
division
for
i
knew
that
for
me
the
real
was
not
in
picardy
and
that
my
job
was
not
so
easy
as
holding
a
length
of
line
also
i
longed
to
be
at
the
same
work
as
mary
i
remember
waking
up
in
billets
the
morning
after
the
night
at
the
chateau
with
the
feeling
that
i
had
become
extraordinarily
rich
i
felt
very
humble
too
and
very
kindly
towards
all
the
world
even
to
the
boche
though
i
ca
say
i
had
ever
hated
him
very
wildly
you
find
hate
more
among
journalists
and
politicians
at
home
than
among
fighting
men
i
wanted
to
be
quiet
and
alone
to
think
and
since
that
was
impossible
i
went
about
my
work
in
a
happy
abstraction
i
tried
not
to
look
ahead
but
only
to
live
in
the
present
remembering
that
a
war
was
on
and
that
there
was
desperate
and
dangerous
business
before
me
and
that
my
hopes
hung
on
a
slender
thread
yet
for
all
that
i
had
sometimes
to
let
my
fancies
go
free
and
revel
in
delicious
dreams
but
there
was
one
thought
that
always
brought
me
back
to
hard
ground
and
that
was
ivery
i
do
not
think
i
hated
anybody
in
the
world
but
him
it
was
his
relation
to
mary
that
stung
me
he
had
the
insolence
with
all
his
past
to
make
love
to
that
clean
and
radiant
girl
i
felt
that
he
and
i
stood
as
mortal
antagonists
and
the
thought
pleased
me
for
it
helped
me
to
put
some
honest
detestation
into
my
job
also
i
was
going
to
win
twice
i
had
failed
but
the
third
time
i
should
succeed
it
had
been
like
ranging
shots
for
a
gun
first
short
second
over
and
i
vowed
that
the
third
should
be
dead
on
the
mark
i
was
summoned
to
where
i
had
half
an
hour
talk
with
the
greatest
british
commander
i
can
see
yet
his
patient
kindly
face
and
that
steady
eye
which
no
vicissitude
of
fortune
could
perturb
he
took
the
biggest
view
for
he
was
statesman
as
well
as
soldier
and
knew
that
the
whole
world
was
one
and
every
man
and
woman
among
the
combatant
nations
was
in
the
so
contradictory
is
human
nature
that
talk
made
me
wish
for
a
moment
to
stay
where
i
was
i
wanted
to
go
on
serving
under
that
man
i
realized
suddenly
how
much
i
loved
my
work
and
when
i
got
back
to
my
quarters
that
night
and
saw
my
men
swinging
in
from
a
route
march
i
could
have
howled
like
a
dog
at
leaving
them
though
i
say
it
who
should
there
was
a
better
division
in
the
army
one
morning
a
few
days
later
i
picked
up
mary
in
amiens
i
always
liked
the
place
for
after
the
dirt
of
the
somme
it
was
a
comfort
to
go
there
for
a
bath
and
a
square
meal
and
it
had
the
noblest
church
that
the
hand
of
man
ever
built
for
god
it
was
a
clear
morning
when
we
started
from
the
boulevard
beside
the
railway
station
and
the
air
smelt
of
washed
streets
and
fresh
coffee
and
women
were
going
marketing
and
the
little
trams
ran
clanking
by
just
as
in
any
other
city
far
from
the
sound
of
guns
there
was
very
little
khaki
or
about
and
i
remember
thinking
how
completely
amiens
had
got
out
of
the
two
months
later
it
was
a
different
story
to
the
end
i
shall
count
that
day
as
one
of
the
happiest
in
my
life
spring
was
in
the
air
though
the
trees
and
fields
had
still
their
winter
colouring
a
thousand
good
fresh
scents
came
out
of
the
earth
and
the
larks
were
busy
over
the
new
furrows
i
remember
that
we
ran
up
a
little
glen
where
a
stream
spread
into
pools
among
sallows
and
the
roadside
trees
were
heavy
with
mistletoe
on
the
tableland
beyond
the
somme
valley
the
sun
shone
like
april
at
beauvais
we
lunched
badly
in
an
inn
badly
as
to
food
but
there
was
an
excellent
burgundy
at
two
francs
a
bottle
then
we
slipped
down
through
little
townships
to
the
seine
and
in
the
late
afternoon
passed
through
st
germains
forest
the
wide
green
spaces
among
the
trees
set
my
fancy
dwelling
on
that
divine
english
countryside
where
mary
and
i
would
one
day
make
our
home
she
had
been
in
high
spirits
all
the
journey
but
when
i
spoke
of
the
cotswolds
her
face
grew
grave
let
us
speak
of
it
dick
she
said
too
happy
a
thing
and
i
feel
as
if
it
would
wither
if
we
touched
it
i
do
let
myself
think
of
peace
and
home
for
it
makes
me
too
homesick
i
think
we
shall
get
there
some
day
you
and
i
but
it
a
long
road
to
the
delectable
mountains
and
faithful
you
know
has
to
die
first
there
is
a
price
to
be
paid
the
words
sobered
me
is
our
faithful
i
asked
do
know
but
he
was
the
best
of
the
pilgrims
then
as
if
a
veil
had
lifted
her
mood
changed
and
when
we
came
through
the
suburbs
of
paris
and
swung
down
the
champs
elysees
she
was
in
a
holiday
humour
the
lights
were
twinkling
in
the
blue
january
dusk
and
the
warm
breath
of
the
city
came
to
greet
us
i
knew
little
of
the
place
for
i
had
visited
it
once
only
on
a
four
days
paris
leave
but
it
had
seemed
to
me
then
the
most
habitable
of
cities
and
now
coming
from
the
with
mary
by
my
side
it
was
like
the
happy
ending
of
a
dream
i
left
her
at
her
cousin
house
near
the
rue
st
honore
and
deposited
myself
according
to
instructions
at
the
hotel
louis
quinze
there
i
wallowed
in
a
hot
bath
and
got
into
the
civilian
clothes
which
had
been
sent
on
from
london
they
made
me
feel
that
i
had
taken
leave
of
my
division
for
good
and
all
this
time
blenkiron
had
a
private
room
where
we
were
to
dine
and
a
more
wonderful
litter
of
books
and
cigar
boxes
i
have
never
seen
for
he
had
a
notion
of
tidiness
i
could
hear
him
grunting
at
his
toilet
in
the
adjacent
bedroom
and
i
noticed
that
the
table
was
laid
for
three
i
went
downstairs
to
get
a
paper
and
on
the
way
ran
into
launcelot
wake
he
was
no
longer
a
private
in
a
labour
battalion
evening
clothes
showed
beneath
his
overcoat
wake
are
you
in
this
push
too
suppose
so
he
said
and
his
manner
was
not
cordial
i
was
ordered
down
here
my
business
is
to
do
as
i
am
told
to
dine
i
asked
i
dining
with
some
friends
at
the
crillon
then
he
looked
me
in
the
face
and
his
eyes
were
hot
as
i
first
remembered
them
hear
i
to
congratulate
you
hannay
and
he
held
out
a
limp
hand
i
never
felt
more
antagonism
in
a
human
being
do
like
it
i
said
for
i
guessed
what
he
meant
on
earth
can
i
like
it
he
cried
angrily
lord
man
murder
her
soul
you
an
ordinary
stupid
successful
fellow
and
she
she
the
most
precious
thing
god
ever
made
you
can
never
understand
a
fraction
of
her
preciousness
but
you
clip
her
wings
all
right
she
can
never
fly
now
he
poured
out
this
hysterical
stuff
to
me
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
within
hearing
of
an
elderly
french
widow
with
a
poodle
i
had
no
impulse
to
be
angry
for
i
was
far
too
happy
wake
i
said
all
too
close
together
to
quarrel
not
fit
to
black
mary
shoes
you
ca
put
me
too
low
or
her
too
high
but
i
at
least
the
sense
to
know
it
you
could
want
me
to
be
humbler
than
i
felt
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
went
out
to
the
street
infernal
magnanimity
would
break
any
man
temper
i
went
upstairs
to
find
blenkiron
washed
and
shaven
admiring
a
pair
of
bright
shoes
dick
i
been
wearying
bad
to
see
you
i
was
nervous
you
would
be
blown
to
glory
for
i
been
reading
awful
things
about
your
battles
in
the
noospapers
the
war
correspondents
worry
me
so
i
take
breakfast
he
mixed
cocktails
and
clinked
his
glass
on
mine
to
the
young
lady
i
was
trying
to
write
her
a
pretty
little
sonnet
but
the
darned
rhymes
would
fit
i
gotten
a
heap
of
things
to
say
to
you
when
we
finished
dinner
mary
came
in
her
cheeks
bright
from
the
weather
and
blenkiron
promptly
fell
abashed
but
she
had
a
way
to
meet
his
shyness
for
when
he
began
an
embarrassed
speech
of
good
wishes
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
oddly
enough
that
set
him
completely
at
his
ease
it
was
pleasant
to
eat
off
linen
and
china
again
pleasant
to
see
old
blenkiron
benignant
face
and
the
way
he
tucked
into
his
food
but
it
was
delicious
for
me
to
sit
at
a
meal
with
mary
across
the
table
it
made
me
feel
that
she
was
really
mine
and
not
a
pixie
that
would
vanish
at
a
word
to
blenkiron
she
bore
herself
like
an
affectionate
but
mischievous
daughter
while
the
desperately
refined
manners
that
afflicted
him
whenever
women
were
concerned
mellowed
into
something
like
his
everyday
self
they
did
most
of
the
talking
and
i
remember
he
fetched
from
some
mysterious
a
great
box
of
chocolates
which
you
could
no
longer
buy
in
paris
and
the
two
ate
them
like
spoiled
children
i
did
want
to
talk
for
it
was
pure
happiness
for
me
to
look
on
i
loved
to
watch
her
when
the
servants
had
gone
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
like
a
schoolboy
her
crisp
gold
hair
a
little
rumpled
cracking
walnuts
with
gusto
like
some
child
who
has
been
allowed
down
from
the
nursery
for
dessert
and
means
to
make
the
most
of
it
with
his
first
cigar
blenkiron
got
to
business
want
to
know
about
the
we
been
busy
on
at
home
well
it
finished
now
thanks
to
you
dick
we
were
getting
on
very
fast
till
you
took
to
peroosing
the
press
on
your
and
dropped
us
that
hint
about
the
ads
there
was
something
in
it
i
asked
was
black
hell
in
it
there
was
any
gussiter
but
there
was
a
mighty
fine
little
syndicate
of
crooks
with
old
man
gresson
at
the
back
of
them
first
thing
i
started
out
to
get
the
cipher
it
took
some
looking
for
but
there
no
cipher
on
earth
ca
be
got
hold
of
somehow
if
you
know
it
there
and
in
this
case
we
were
helped
a
lot
by
the
return
messages
in
the
german
papers
it
was
bad
stuff
when
we
read
it
and
explained
the
darned
leakages
in
important
noos
we
been
up
against
at
first
i
figured
to
keep
the
thing
going
and
turn
gussiter
into
a
corporation
with
john
blenkiron
as
president
but
it
would
do
for
at
the
first
hint
of
tampering
with
their
communications
the
whole
bunch
got
skeery
and
sent
out
sos
signals
so
we
tenderly
plucked
the
flowers
too
i
asked
he
nodded
guess
your
seafaring
companion
now
under
the
sod
we
had
collected
enough
evidence
to
hang
him
ten
times
over
but
that
was
the
least
of
it
for
your
little
old
cipher
dick
gave
us
a
line
on
ivery
i
asked
how
and
blenkiron
told
me
the
story
he
had
about
a
dozen
proving
that
the
organization
of
the
game
had
its
headquarters
in
switzerland
he
suspected
ivery
from
the
first
but
the
man
had
vanished
out
of
his
ken
so
he
started
working
from
the
other
end
and
instead
of
trying
to
deduce
the
swiss
business
from
ivery
he
tried
to
deduce
ivery
from
the
swiss
business
he
went
to
berne
and
made
a
conspicuous
public
fool
of
himself
for
several
weeks
he
called
himself
an
agent
of
the
american
propaganda
there
and
took
some
advertising
space
in
the
press
and
put
in
announcements
of
his
mission
with
the
result
that
the
swiss
government
threatened
to
turn
him
out
of
the
country
if
he
tampered
that
amount
with
their
neutrality
he
also
wrote
a
lot
of
rot
in
the
geneva
newspapers
which
he
paid
to
have
printed
explaining
how
he
was
a
pacifist
and
was
going
to
convert
germany
to
peace
by
advertisement
of
war
aims
all
this
was
in
keeping
with
his
english
reputation
and
he
wanted
to
make
himself
a
bait
for
ivery
but
ivery
did
not
rise
to
the
fly
and
though
he
had
a
dozen
agents
working
for
him
on
the
quiet
he
could
never
hear
of
the
name
chelius
that
was
he
reckoned
a
very
private
and
particular
name
among
the
wild
birds
however
he
got
to
know
a
good
deal
about
the
swiss
end
of
the
business
that
took
some
doing
and
cost
a
lot
of
money
his
best
people
were
a
girl
who
posed
as
a
mannequin
in
a
milliner
shop
in
lyons
and
a
concierge
in
a
big
hotel
at
st
moritz
his
most
important
discovery
was
that
there
was
a
second
cipher
in
the
return
messages
sent
from
switzerland
different
from
the
one
that
the
gussiter
lot
used
in
england
he
got
this
cipher
but
though
he
could
read
it
he
could
make
anything
out
of
it
he
concluded
that
it
was
a
very
secret
means
of
communication
between
the
inner
circle
of
the
wild
birds
and
that
ivery
must
be
at
the
back
of
it
but
he
was
still
a
long
way
from
finding
out
anything
that
mattered
then
the
whole
situation
changed
for
mary
got
in
touch
with
ivery
i
must
say
she
behaved
like
a
shameless
minx
for
she
kept
on
writing
to
him
to
an
address
he
had
once
given
her
in
paris
and
suddenly
she
got
an
answer
she
was
in
paris
herself
helping
to
run
one
of
the
railway
canteens
and
staying
with
her
french
cousins
the
de
mezieres
one
day
he
came
to
see
her
that
showed
the
boldness
of
the
man
and
his
cleverness
for
the
whole
secret
police
of
france
were
after
him
and
they
never
got
within
sight
or
sound
yet
here
he
was
coming
openly
in
the
afternoon
to
have
tea
with
an
english
girl
it
showed
another
thing
which
made
me
blaspheme
a
man
so
resolute
and
in
his
job
must
have
been
pretty
badly
in
love
to
take
a
risk
like
that
he
came
and
he
called
himself
the
capitaine
bommaerts
with
a
transport
job
on
the
staff
of
the
french
he
was
on
the
staff
right
enough
too
mary
said
that
when
she
heard
that
name
she
nearly
fell
down
he
was
quite
frank
with
her
and
she
with
him
they
are
both
peacemakers
ready
to
break
the
laws
of
any
land
for
the
sake
of
a
great
ideal
goodness
knows
what
stuff
they
talked
together
mary
said
she
would
blush
to
think
of
it
till
her
dying
day
and
i
gathered
that
on
her
side
it
was
a
mixture
of
launcelot
wake
at
his
most
pedantic
and
schoolgirl
silliness
he
came
again
and
they
met
often
unbeknown
to
the
decorous
madame
de
mezieres
they
walked
together
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
once
with
a
beating
heart
she
motored
with
him
to
auteuil
for
luncheon
he
spoke
of
his
house
in
picardy
and
there
were
moments
i
gathered
when
he
became
the
declared
lover
to
be
rebuffed
with
a
hoydenish
shyness
presently
the
pace
became
too
hot
and
after
some
anguished
arguments
with
bullivant
on
the
telephone
she
went
off
to
douvecourt
to
lady
manorwater
hospital
she
went
there
to
escape
from
him
but
mainly
i
think
to
have
a
look
trembling
in
every
limb
mind
you
at
the
chateau
of
eaucourt
i
had
only
to
think
of
mary
to
know
just
what
joan
of
arc
was
no
man
ever
born
could
have
done
that
kind
of
thing
it
was
recklessness
it
was
sheer
calculating
courage
then
blenkiron
took
up
the
tale
the
newspaper
we
found
that
christmas
eve
in
the
chateau
was
of
tremendous
importance
for
bommaerts
had
pricked
out
in
the
advertisement
the
very
special
second
cipher
of
the
wild
birds
that
proved
that
ivery
was
at
the
back
of
the
swiss
business
but
blenkiron
made
doubly
sure
considered
the
time
had
come
he
said
pay
high
for
valuable
noos
so
i
sold
the
enemy
a
very
pretty
if
you
ever
gave
your
mind
to
ciphers
and
illicit
correspondence
dick
you
would
know
that
the
one
kind
of
document
you
ca
write
on
in
invisible
ink
is
a
coated
paper
the
kind
they
use
in
the
weeklies
to
print
photographs
of
leading
actresses
and
the
stately
homes
of
england
anything
wet
that
touches
it
corrugates
the
surface
a
little
and
you
can
tell
with
a
microscope
if
someone
been
playing
at
it
well
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
discover
just
how
to
get
over
that
little
difficulty
how
to
write
on
glazed
paper
with
a
quill
so
as
the
cutest
analyst
spot
it
and
likewise
how
to
detect
the
writing
i
decided
to
sacrifice
that
invention
casting
my
bread
upon
the
waters
and
looking
for
a
bakery
in
return
i
had
it
sold
to
the
enemy
the
job
wanted
delicate
handling
but
the
tenth
man
from
me
he
was
an
austrian
jew
did
the
deal
and
scooped
fifty
thousand
dollars
out
of
it
then
i
lay
low
to
watch
how
my
friend
would
use
the
and
i
did
wait
long
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
folded
sheet
of
over
a
photogravure
plate
ran
some
words
in
a
large
sprawling
hand
as
if
written
with
a
brush
page
when
i
got
it
yesterday
he
said
an
unassuming
picture
of
general
petain
presenting
military
medals
there
was
a
scratch
or
a
ripple
on
its
surface
but
i
got
busy
with
it
and
see
there
he
pointed
out
two
names
the
writing
was
a
set
of
we
did
not
know
but
two
names
stood
out
which
i
knew
too
well
they
were
and
god
i
cried
uncanny
it
only
shows
that
if
you
chew
long
enough
said
mary
must
say
that
again
at
the
best
it
an
ugly
metaphor
and
you
making
it
a
platitude
is
ivery
anyhow
i
asked
you
know
more
about
him
than
we
knew
in
the
summer
mary
what
did
bommaerts
pretend
to
be
englishman
mary
spoke
in
the
most
tone
as
if
it
were
a
perfectly
usual
thing
to
be
made
love
to
by
a
spy
and
that
rather
soothed
my
annoyance
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
he
proposed
to
take
me
to
a
in
devonshire
i
rather
think
too
he
had
a
place
in
scotland
but
of
course
he
a
german
said
blenkiron
slowly
got
on
to
his
record
and
it
is
a
pretty
story
it
taken
some
working
out
but
i
got
all
the
links
tested
now
he
a
boche
and
a
nobleman
in
his
own
state
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
graf
von
schwabing
i
shook
my
head
think
i
have
heard
uncle
charlie
speak
of
him
said
mary
wrinkling
her
brows
used
to
hunt
with
the
pytchley
the
man
but
he
has
troubled
the
pytchley
for
the
last
eight
years
there
was
a
time
when
he
was
the
last
thing
in
smartness
in
the
german
court
officer
in
the
guards
ancient
family
rich
darned
clever
all
the
fixings
kaiser
liked
him
and
it
easy
to
see
why
i
guess
a
man
who
had
as
many
personalities
as
the
graf
was
amusing
company
specially
among
the
germans
who
in
my
experience
do
excel
in
the
lighter
vein
anyway
he
was
william
boy
and
there
was
a
mother
with
a
daughter
who
was
out
gunning
for
otto
von
schwabing
he
was
about
as
popular
in
london
and
noo
york
and
in
paris
too
ask
sir
walter
about
him
dick
he
says
he
had
twice
the
brains
of
kuhlmann
and
better
manners
than
the
austrian
fellow
he
used
to
yarn
about
well
one
day
there
came
an
almighty
court
scandal
and
the
bottom
dropped
out
of
the
graf
world
it
was
a
pretty
beastly
story
and
i
do
gather
that
schwabing
was
as
deep
in
it
as
some
others
but
the
trouble
was
that
those
others
had
to
be
shielded
at
all
costs
and
schwabing
was
made
the
scapegoat
his
name
came
out
in
the
papers
and
he
had
to
go
was
the
case
called
i
asked
blenkiron
mentioned
a
name
and
i
knew
why
the
word
schwabing
was
familiar
i
had
read
the
story
long
ago
in
rhodesia
was
some
smash
blenkiron
went
on
was
drummed
out
of
the
guards
out
of
the
clubs
out
of
the
country
now
how
would
you
have
felt
dick
if
you
had
been
the
graf
your
life
and
work
and
happiness
crossed
out
and
all
to
save
a
mangy
princeling
bitter
as
hell
you
say
hungering
for
a
chance
to
put
it
across
the
lot
that
had
outed
you
you
would
rest
till
you
had
william
sobbing
on
his
knees
asking
your
pardon
and
you
not
thinking
of
granting
it
the
way
you
feel
but
that
was
the
graf
way
and
what
more
it
is
the
german
way
he
went
into
exile
hating
humanity
and
with
a
heart
all
poison
and
snakes
but
itching
to
get
back
and
i
tell
you
why
it
because
his
kind
of
german
has
got
any
other
home
on
this
earth
oh
yes
i
know
there
stacks
of
good
old
teutons
come
and
squat
in
our
little
country
and
turn
into
fine
americans
you
can
do
a
lot
with
them
if
you
catch
them
young
and
teach
them
the
declaration
of
independence
and
make
them
study
our
sunday
papers
but
you
ca
deny
there
something
comic
in
the
rough
about
all
germans
before
civilized
them
they
a
pecooliar
people
a
darned
pecooliar
people
else
they
would
staff
all
the
menial
and
indecent
occupations
on
the
globe
but
that
pecooliarity
which
is
only
in
the
working
boche
is
in
the
bone
of
the
grandee
your
german
aristocracy
consort
on
terms
of
equality
with
any
other
upper
ten
thousand
they
swagger
and
bluff
about
the
world
but
they
know
very
well
that
the
world
sniggering
at
them
they
like
a
boss
from
salt
creek
gully
who
made
his
pile
and
bought
a
dress
suit
and
dropped
into
a
newport
evening
party
they
do
know
where
to
put
their
hands
or
how
to
keep
their
feet
still
your
english
nobleman
has
got
to
keep
jogging
himself
to
treat
them
as
equals
instead
of
sending
them
down
to
the
servants
hall
their
fine
fixings
are
just
the
high
light
that
reveals
the
everlasting
jay
they
ca
be
gentlemen
because
they
are
sure
of
themselves
the
world
laughs
at
them
and
they
know
it
and
it
riles
them
like
hell
that
why
when
a
graf
is
booted
out
of
the
fatherland
he
got
to
creep
back
somehow
or
be
a
wandering
jew
for
the
rest
of
time
blenkiron
lit
another
cigar
and
fixed
me
with
his
steady
ruminating
eye
eight
years
the
man
has
slaved
body
and
soul
for
the
men
who
degraded
him
he
earned
his
restoration
and
i
daresay
he
got
it
in
his
pocket
if
merit
was
rewarded
he
should
be
covered
with
iron
crosses
and
red
eagles
he
had
a
pretty
good
hand
to
start
out
with
he
knew
other
countries
and
he
was
a
dandy
at
languages
more
he
had
an
uncommon
gift
for
living
a
part
that
is
real
genius
dick
however
much
it
gets
up
against
us
best
of
all
he
had
a
outfit
of
brains
i
ca
say
i
ever
struck
a
better
and
i
come
across
some
bright
citizens
in
my
time
and
now
he
going
to
win
out
unless
we
get
mighty
busy
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
solid
figure
of
andrew
amos
revealed
itself
time
ye
was
home
miss
mary
it
chappit
as
i
came
up
the
stairs
it
comin
on
to
rain
so
i
brought
an
umbrelly
word
i
said
old
is
the
man
gone
blenkiron
replied
i
turned
to
mary
who
nodded
than
you
dick
she
said
wickedly
as
she
got
into
her
big
jaeger
coat
going
to
see
you
home
i
said
allowed
you
had
quite
enough
of
my
society
for
one
day
andrew
on
escort
duty
tonight
blenkiron
looked
after
her
as
the
door
closed
reckon
you
got
the
best
girl
in
the
world
thinks
the
same
i
said
grimly
for
my
detestation
of
the
man
who
had
made
love
to
mary
fairly
choked
me
can
see
why
here
this
degenerate
coming
out
of
his
rotten
class
all
pampered
and
petted
and
satiated
with
the
easy
pleasures
of
life
he
has
seen
nothing
of
women
except
the
bad
kind
and
the
overfed
specimens
of
his
own
country
i
hate
being
impolite
about
females
but
i
always
considered
the
german
variety
uncommon
like
cows
he
has
had
desperate
years
of
intrigue
and
danger
and
consorting
with
every
kind
of
scallawag
remember
he
a
big
man
and
a
poet
with
a
brain
and
an
imagination
that
takes
every
grade
without
changing
gears
suddenly
he
meets
something
that
is
as
fresh
and
lovely
as
a
spring
flower
and
has
wits
too
and
the
steeliest
courage
and
yet
is
all
youth
and
gaiety
it
a
new
experience
for
him
a
kind
of
revelation
and
he
big
enough
to
value
her
as
she
should
be
valued
no
dick
i
can
understand
you
getting
cross
but
i
reckon
it
an
item
to
the
man
credit
his
blind
spot
all
the
same
i
said
blind
spot
blenkiron
repeated
solemnly
please
god
going
to
remember
that
next
morning
in
miserable
sloppy
weather
blenkiron
carted
me
about
paris
we
climbed
five
sets
of
stairs
to
a
flat
away
up
in
montmartre
where
i
was
talked
to
by
a
fat
man
with
spectacles
and
a
slow
voice
and
told
various
things
that
deeply
concerned
me
then
i
went
to
a
room
in
the
boulevard
st
germain
with
a
little
cabinet
opening
off
it
where
i
was
shown
papers
and
maps
and
some
figures
on
a
sheet
of
paper
that
made
me
open
my
eyes
we
lunched
in
a
modest
cafe
tucked
away
behind
the
palais
royal
and
our
companions
were
two
alsatians
who
spoke
german
better
than
a
boche
and
had
no
names
only
numbers
in
the
afternoon
i
went
to
a
low
building
beside
the
invalides
and
saw
many
generals
including
more
than
one
whose
features
were
familiar
in
two
hemispheres
i
told
them
everything
about
myself
and
i
was
examined
like
a
convict
and
all
particulars
about
my
appearance
and
manner
of
speech
written
down
in
a
book
that
was
to
prepare
the
way
for
me
in
case
of
need
among
the
vast
army
of
those
who
work
underground
and
know
their
chief
but
do
not
know
each
other
the
rain
cleared
before
night
and
blenkiron
and
i
walked
back
to
the
hotel
through
that
dusk
that
you
get
in
a
french
winter
we
passed
a
company
of
american
soldiers
and
blenkiron
had
to
stop
and
stare
i
could
see
that
he
was
stiff
with
pride
though
he
show
it
think
of
that
bunch
he
asked
stuff
i
said
men
are
all
right
he
drawled
critically
some
of
the
are
a
bit
puffy
they
want
fining
down
get
it
soon
enough
honest
fellows
you
do
keep
your
weight
long
in
this
war
dick
he
said
shyly
do
you
truly
think
of
our
americans
you
seen
a
lot
of
them
and
i
value
your
views
his
tone
was
that
of
a
bashful
author
asking
for
an
opinion
on
his
first
book
tell
you
what
i
think
you
constructing
a
great
army
and
that
the
most
formidable
fighting
machine
on
earth
this
kind
of
war
does
want
the
berserker
so
much
as
the
quiet
fellow
with
a
trained
mind
and
a
lot
to
fight
for
the
american
ranks
are
filled
with
all
sorts
from
to
college
boys
but
mostly
with
decent
lads
that
have
good
prospects
in
life
before
them
and
are
fighting
because
they
feel
they
bound
to
not
because
they
like
it
it
was
the
same
stock
that
pulled
through
your
civil
war
we
have
a
division
too
scottish
territorials
mostly
clerks
and
shopmen
and
engineers
and
farmers
sons
when
i
first
struck
them
my
only
crab
was
that
the
officers
were
much
better
than
the
men
still
true
but
the
men
are
and
consequently
so
are
the
officers
that
division
gets
top
marks
in
the
boche
calendar
for
sheer
fighting
devilment
and
please
god
that
what
your
american
army
going
to
be
you
can
wash
out
the
old
idea
of
a
regiment
of
scallawags
commanded
by
dukes
that
was
right
enough
maybe
in
the
days
when
you
hurrooshed
into
battle
waving
a
banner
but
it
do
do
with
high
explosives
and
a
couple
of
million
men
on
each
side
and
a
battle
front
of
five
hundred
miles
the
hero
of
this
war
is
the
plain
man
out
of
the
middle
class
who
wants
to
get
back
to
his
home
and
is
going
to
use
all
the
brains
and
grit
he
possesses
to
finish
the
job
soon
sounds
about
right
said
blenkiron
reflectively
pleases
me
some
for
you
maybe
guessed
that
i
respect
the
british
army
quite
a
little
which
part
of
it
do
you
put
top
of
it
good
the
french
are
keen
judges
and
they
give
front
place
to
the
scots
and
the
australians
for
myself
i
think
the
backbone
of
the
army
is
the
english
county
regiments
that
hardly
ever
get
into
the
papers
though
i
do
know
if
i
had
to
pick
but
i
take
the
south
africans
there
only
a
brigade
of
them
but
they
delight
in
a
battle
but
then
you
say
i
prejudiced
drawled
blenkiron
you
a
mighty
empire
anyhow
sojourned
up
and
down
it
and
i
ca
guess
how
the
highbrows
in
your
little
island
came
to
put
it
together
but
i
let
you
into
a
secret
dick
i
read
this
morning
in
a
noospaper
that
there
was
a
natural
affinity
between
americans
and
the
men
of
the
british
dominions
take
it
from
me
there
is
at
least
not
with
this
american
i
do
understand
them
one
little
bit
when
i
see
your
lean
tall
australians
with
the
sun
at
the
back
of
their
eyes
i
looking
at
men
from
another
planet
outside
you
and
peter
i
never
got
to
fathom
a
south
african
the
canadians
live
over
the
fence
from
us
but
you
mix
up
a
canuck
with
a
yank
in
your
remarks
and
you
get
a
bat
in
the
eye
but
most
of
us
americans
have
gotten
a
grip
on
your
old
country
you
find
us
mighty
respectful
to
other
parts
of
your
empire
but
we
say
anything
we
damn
well
please
about
england
you
see
we
know
her
that
well
and
like
her
that
well
we
can
be
free
with
her
like
he
concluded
as
we
reached
the
hotel
like
a
lot
of
boys
that
are
getting
on
in
the
world
and
are
a
bit
jealous
and
with
each
other
but
they
all
at
home
with
the
old
man
who
used
to
warm
them
up
with
a
hickory
cane
even
though
sometimes
in
their
haste
they
call
him
a
that
night
at
dinner
we
talked
solid
business
blenkiron
and
i
and
a
young
french
colonel
from
the
iiieme
section
at
blenkiron
i
remember
got
very
hurt
about
being
called
a
business
man
by
the
frenchman
who
thought
he
was
paying
him
a
compliment
it
out
he
said
is
a
word
that
gone
bad
with
me
just
two
kind
of
men
those
who
gotten
sense
and
those
who
have
a
big
percentage
of
us
americans
make
our
living
by
trading
but
we
do
think
because
a
man
in
business
or
even
because
he
made
big
money
that
he
any
natural
good
at
every
job
we
made
a
college
professor
our
president
and
do
what
he
tells
us
like
little
boys
though
he
do
earn
more
than
some
of
us
pay
our
works
manager
you
english
have
gotten
business
on
the
brain
and
think
a
fellow
a
dandy
at
handling
your
government
if
he
happens
to
have
made
a
pile
by
some
ramp
on
your
stock
exchange
it
makes
me
tired
about
the
best
business
nation
on
earth
but
for
god
sake
do
begin
to
talk
about
it
or
you
lose
your
power
and
do
go
confusing
real
business
with
the
ordinary
gift
of
raking
in
the
dollars
any
man
with
sense
could
make
money
if
he
wanted
to
but
he
may
want
he
may
prefer
the
fun
of
the
job
and
let
other
people
do
the
looting
i
reckon
the
biggest
business
on
the
globe
today
is
the
work
behind
your
lines
and
the
way
you
feed
and
supply
and
transport
your
army
it
beats
the
steel
corporation
and
the
standard
oil
to
a
frazzle
but
the
man
at
the
head
of
it
all
do
earn
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
a
month
your
nation
getting
to
worship
mammon
dick
cut
it
out
there
just
the
one
difference
in
humanity
sense
or
no
sense
and
most
likely
you
wo
find
any
more
sense
in
the
man
that
makes
a
billion
selling
bonds
than
in
his
brother
tim
that
lives
in
a
shack
and
sells
not
speaking
out
of
sinful
jealousy
for
there
was
a
day
when
i
was
reckoned
a
railroad
king
and
i
quit
with
a
bigger
pile
than
kings
usually
retire
on
but
i
have
the
sense
of
old
peter
who
never
even
had
a
bank
account
and
it
sense
that
wins
in
this
war
the
colonel
who
spoke
good
english
asked
a
question
about
a
speech
which
some
politician
had
made
is
all
the
sense
i
like
to
see
at
the
top
said
blenkiron
fine
at
smooth
words
that
would
matter
but
thinking
smooth
thoughts
what
make
of
the
situation
dick
think
it
the
worst
since
first
ypres
i
said
but
god
knows
why
knows
why
blenkiron
repeated
reckon
it
a
simple
calculation
and
you
ca
deny
it
any
more
than
a
mathematical
law
russia
is
counted
out
the
boche
wo
get
food
from
her
for
a
good
many
months
but
he
can
get
more
men
and
he
got
them
he
fighting
only
on
one
foot
and
he
been
able
to
bring
troops
and
guns
west
so
he
as
strong
as
the
allies
now
on
paper
and
he
stronger
in
reality
he
got
better
railways
behind
him
and
he
fighting
on
inside
lines
and
can
concentrate
fast
against
any
bit
of
our
front
no
soldier
but
that
so
dick
the
frenchman
smiled
and
shook
his
head
the
same
they
will
not
pass
they
could
not
when
they
were
two
to
one
in
and
they
will
not
now
if
we
allies
could
not
break
through
in
the
last
year
when
we
had
many
more
men
how
will
the
germans
succeed
now
with
only
equal
numbers
blenkiron
did
not
look
convinced
what
they
all
say
i
talked
to
a
general
last
week
about
the
coming
offensive
and
he
said
he
was
praying
for
it
to
hurry
up
for
he
reckoned
fritz
would
get
the
fright
of
his
life
it
a
good
spirit
maybe
but
i
do
think
it
sound
on
the
facts
we
got
two
mighty
great
armies
of
fine
but
because
we
two
commands
we
bound
to
move
ragged
like
a
peal
of
bells
the
hun
got
one
army
and
forty
years
of
stiff
tradition
and
what
more
he
going
all
out
this
time
he
going
to
smash
our
front
before
america
lines
up
or
perish
in
the
attempt
why
do
you
suppose
all
the
peace
racket
in
germany
has
died
down
and
the
very
men
that
were
talking
democracy
in
the
summer
are
now
hot
for
fighting
to
a
finish
i
tell
you
it
because
old
ludendorff
has
promised
them
complete
victory
this
spring
if
they
spend
enough
men
and
the
boche
is
a
good
gambler
and
is
out
to
risk
it
we
not
up
against
a
local
attack
this
time
we
standing
up
to
a
great
nation
going
for
victory
or
destruction
if
we
broken
then
america
got
to
fight
a
new
campaign
by
herself
when
she
ready
and
the
boche
has
time
to
make
russia
his
and
diddle
our
blockade
that
puts
another
five
years
on
to
the
war
maybe
another
ten
are
we
free
and
independent
peoples
going
to
endure
that
much
i
tell
you
tossing
to
quit
before
easter
he
turned
towards
me
and
i
nodded
assent
more
or
less
my
view
i
said
ought
to
hold
but
it
be
by
our
teeth
and
nails
for
the
next
six
months
we
be
fighting
without
any
margin
my
friends
you
put
it
too
gravely
cried
the
frenchman
may
lose
a
mile
or
two
of
ground
yes
but
serious
danger
is
not
possible
they
had
better
chances
at
verdun
and
they
failed
why
should
they
succeed
now
they
are
staking
everything
blenkiron
replied
is
the
last
desperate
struggle
of
a
wounded
beast
and
in
these
struggles
sometimes
the
hunter
perishes
dick
right
we
got
a
wasting
margin
and
every
extra
ounce
of
weight
going
to
tell
the
battle
in
the
field
and
it
also
in
every
corner
of
every
allied
land
that
why
within
the
next
two
months
we
got
to
get
even
with
the
wild
birds
the
french
colonel
his
name
was
de
valliere
smiled
at
the
name
and
blenkiron
answered
my
unspoken
question
going
to
satisfy
some
of
your
curiosity
dick
for
i
put
together
considerable
noos
of
the
menagerie
germany
has
a
good
army
of
spies
outside
her
borders
we
shoot
a
batch
now
and
then
but
the
others
go
on
working
like
beavers
and
they
do
a
mighty
deal
of
harm
they
beautifully
organized
but
they
do
draw
on
such
good
human
material
as
we
and
i
reckon
they
do
pay
in
results
more
than
ten
cents
on
a
dollar
of
trouble
but
there
they
are
they
the
intelligence
officers
and
their
business
is
just
to
forward
noos
they
the
birds
in
the
cage
the
what
is
it
your
friend
called
them
stubenvogel
i
said
but
all
the
birds
are
caged
there
a
few
outside
the
bars
and
they
do
collect
noos
they
do
things
if
there
anything
desperate
they
put
on
the
job
and
they
got
power
to
act
without
waiting
on
instructions
from
home
i
investigated
till
my
tired
and
i
have
made
out
more
than
half
a
dozen
whom
i
can
say
for
certain
are
in
the
business
there
your
pal
the
portuguese
jew
dick
another
a
woman
in
genoa
a
princess
of
some
sort
married
to
a
greek
financier
one
the
editor
of
a
paper
in
the
argentine
one
passes
as
a
baptist
minister
in
colorado
one
was
a
police
spy
in
the
tzar
government
and
is
now
a
revolutionary
in
the
caucasus
and
the
biggest
of
course
is
moxon
ivery
who
in
happier
times
was
the
graf
von
schwabing
there
are
above
a
hundred
people
in
the
world
know
of
their
existence
and
these
hundred
call
them
the
wild
birds
they
work
together
i
asked
they
each
get
their
own
jobs
to
do
but
they
apt
to
flock
together
for
a
big
piece
of
devilment
there
were
four
of
them
in
france
a
year
ago
before
the
battle
of
the
aisne
and
they
pretty
near
rotted
the
french
army
that
so
colonel
the
soldier
nodded
grimly
seduced
our
weary
troops
and
they
bought
many
politicians
almost
they
succeeded
but
not
quite
the
nation
is
sane
again
and
is
judging
and
shooting
the
accomplices
at
its
leisure
but
the
principals
we
have
never
caught
hear
that
dick
said
blenkiron
satisfied
this
is
a
whimsy
of
a
melodramatic
old
yank
i
tell
you
more
you
know
how
ivery
worked
the
submarine
business
from
england
also
it
was
the
wild
birds
that
wrecked
russia
it
was
ivery
that
paid
the
bolshevists
to
sedooce
the
army
and
the
bolshevists
took
his
money
for
their
own
purpose
thinking
they
were
playing
a
deep
game
when
all
the
time
he
was
grinning
like
satan
for
they
were
playing
his
it
was
ivery
or
some
other
of
the
bunch
that
doped
the
brigades
that
broke
at
caporetto
if
i
started
in
to
tell
you
the
history
of
their
doings
you
would
go
to
bed
and
if
you
did
you
would
sleep
there
just
this
to
it
every
finished
subtle
devilry
that
the
boche
has
wrought
among
the
allies
since
august
has
been
the
work
of
the
wild
birds
and
more
or
less
organized
by
ivery
they
worth
half
a
dozen
army
corps
to
ludendorff
they
the
mightiest
poison
merchants
the
world
ever
saw
and
they
the
nerve
of
hell
do
know
i
interrupted
got
his
soft
spot
i
saw
him
in
the
tube
station
but
he
got
the
kind
of
nerve
that
wanted
and
now
i
rather
fancy
he
whistling
in
his
flock
blenkiron
consulted
a
notebook
that
the
argentine
man
started
last
month
for
europe
he
transhipped
from
a
coasting
steamer
in
the
west
indies
and
we
temporarily
lost
track
of
him
but
he
left
his
what
do
you
reckon
that
means
means
blenkiron
continued
solemnly
ivery
thinks
the
nearly
over
the
play
working
up
for
the
big
climax
and
that
climax
is
going
to
be
damnation
for
the
allies
unless
we
get
a
move
on
i
said
what
i
here
for
what
the
move
wild
birds
must
ever
go
home
and
the
man
they
call
ivery
or
bommaerts
or
chelius
has
to
decease
it
a
proposition
but
it
him
or
the
world
that
got
to
break
but
before
he
quits
this
earth
we
bound
to
get
wise
about
some
of
his
plans
and
that
means
that
we
ca
just
shoot
a
pistol
at
his
face
also
we
got
to
find
him
first
we
reckon
he
in
switzerland
but
that
is
a
state
with
quite
a
lot
of
diversified
scenery
to
lose
a
man
in
still
i
guess
we
find
him
but
it
the
kind
of
business
to
plan
out
as
carefully
as
a
battle
i
going
back
to
berne
on
my
old
stunt
to
boss
the
show
and
i
giving
the
orders
you
an
obedient
child
dick
so
i
reckon
on
any
trouble
that
way
then
blenkiron
did
an
ominous
thing
he
pulled
up
a
little
table
and
started
to
lay
out
patience
cards
since
his
duodenum
was
cured
he
seemed
to
have
dropped
that
habit
and
from
his
resuming
it
i
gathered
that
his
mind
was
uneasy
i
can
see
that
scene
as
if
it
were
yesterday
the
french
colonel
in
an
armchair
smoking
a
cigarette
in
a
long
amber
holder
and
blenkiron
sitting
primly
on
the
edge
of
a
yellow
silk
ottoman
dealing
his
cards
and
looking
guiltily
towards
me
have
peter
for
company
he
said
a
sad
man
but
he
has
a
great
heart
and
he
been
mighty
useful
to
me
already
going
to
move
him
to
england
very
soon
the
authorities
are
afraid
of
him
for
he
apt
to
talk
wild
his
health
having
made
him
peevish
about
the
british
but
there
a
deal
of
in
the
world
and
the
orders
for
his
repatriation
are
slow
in
coming
the
speaker
winked
very
slowly
and
deliberately
with
his
left
eye
i
asked
if
i
was
to
be
with
peter
much
cheered
at
the
prospect
yes
you
and
peter
are
the
collateral
in
the
deal
but
the
big
game
not
with
you
i
had
a
presentiment
of
something
coming
something
anxious
and
unpleasant
mary
in
it
i
asked
he
nodded
and
seemed
to
pull
himself
together
for
an
explanation
here
dick
our
main
job
is
to
get
ivery
back
to
allied
soil
where
we
can
handle
him
and
there
just
the
one
magnet
that
can
fetch
him
back
you
are
going
to
deny
that
i
felt
my
face
getting
very
red
and
that
ugly
hammer
began
beating
in
my
forehead
two
grave
patient
eyes
met
my
glare
damned
if
i
allow
it
i
cried
some
right
to
a
say
in
the
thing
i
wo
have
mary
made
a
decoy
it
too
infernally
degrading
is
pretty
but
war
is
pretty
and
nothing
we
do
is
pretty
i
have
blushed
like
a
rose
when
i
was
young
and
innocent
to
imagine
the
things
i
put
my
hand
to
in
the
last
three
years
but
have
you
any
other
way
dick
i
not
proud
and
i
scrap
the
plan
if
you
can
show
me
another
night
after
night
i
hammered
the
thing
out
and
i
ca
hit
on
a
better
dick
this
is
like
you
and
he
grinned
ruefully
making
yourself
a
fine
argument
in
favour
of
celibacy
in
time
of
war
anyhow
what
is
it
the
poet
sings
white
hands
cling
to
the
bridle
rein
slipping
the
spur
from
the
booted
heel
i
was
as
angry
as
sin
but
i
felt
all
the
time
i
had
no
case
blenkiron
stopped
his
game
of
patience
sending
the
cards
flying
over
the
carpet
and
straddled
on
the
hearthrug
never
going
to
be
a
piker
what
dooty
if
you
wo
carry
it
to
the
other
side
of
hell
what
the
use
of
yapping
about
your
country
if
you
going
to
keep
anything
back
when
she
calls
for
it
what
the
good
of
meaning
to
win
the
war
if
you
do
put
every
cent
you
got
on
your
stake
you
make
me
think
you
like
the
jacks
in
your
english
novels
that
chuck
in
their
hand
and
say
it
up
to
god
and
call
that
seeing
it
through
no
dick
that
kind
of
dooty
deserve
a
blessing
you
durs
keep
back
anything
if
you
want
to
save
your
soul
he
went
on
a
girl
it
is
she
ca
scare
and
she
ca
soil
she
youth
and
innocence
and
she
take
no
more
harm
than
clean
steel
from
a
i
knew
i
was
badly
in
the
wrong
but
my
pride
was
all
raw
not
going
to
agree
till
i
talked
to
mary
miss
mary
has
consented
he
said
gently
made
the
plan
next
day
in
clear
blue
weather
that
might
have
been
may
i
drove
mary
down
to
fontainebleau
we
lunched
in
the
inn
by
the
bridge
and
walked
into
the
forest
i
had
slept
much
for
i
was
tortured
by
what
i
thought
was
anxiety
for
her
but
which
was
in
truth
jealousy
of
ivery
i
do
think
that
i
would
have
minded
her
risking
her
life
for
that
was
part
of
the
game
we
were
both
in
but
i
jibbed
at
the
notion
of
ivery
coming
near
her
again
i
told
myself
it
was
honourable
pride
but
i
knew
deep
down
in
me
that
it
was
jealousy
i
asked
her
if
she
had
accepted
blenkiron
plan
and
she
turned
mischievous
eyes
on
me
knew
i
should
have
a
scene
with
you
dick
i
told
mr
blenkiron
so
of
course
i
agreed
i
not
even
very
much
afraid
of
it
i
a
member
of
the
team
you
know
and
i
must
play
up
to
my
form
i
ca
do
a
man
work
so
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
tackle
the
thing
i
can
do
i
stammered
such
a
such
a
degrading
business
for
a
child
like
you
i
ca
bear
it
makes
me
hot
to
think
of
it
her
reply
was
merry
laughter
an
old
ottoman
dick
you
have
doubled
cape
turk
yet
and
i
do
believe
you
round
seraglio
point
why
women
are
the
brittle
things
men
used
to
think
them
they
never
were
and
the
war
has
made
them
like
whipcord
bless
you
my
dear
we
the
tougher
sex
now
we
had
to
wait
and
endure
and
we
been
so
beaten
on
the
anvil
of
patience
that
we
lost
all
our
megrims
she
put
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
looked
me
in
the
eyes
at
me
dick
look
at
your
espoused
saint
nineteen
years
of
age
next
august
before
the
war
i
should
have
only
just
put
my
hair
up
i
should
have
been
the
kind
of
shivering
debutante
who
blushes
when
she
spoken
to
and
oh
i
should
have
thought
such
silly
silly
things
about
life
well
in
the
last
two
years
been
close
to
it
and
to
death
i
nursed
the
dying
i
seen
souls
in
agony
and
in
triumph
england
has
allowed
me
to
serve
her
as
she
allows
her
sons
oh
i
a
robust
young
woman
now
and
indeed
i
think
women
were
always
robuster
than
men
dick
dear
dick
we
lovers
but
we
comrades
too
always
comrades
and
comrades
trust
each
other
i
had
anything
to
say
except
contrition
for
i
had
my
lesson
i
had
been
slipping
away
in
my
thoughts
from
the
gravity
of
our
task
and
mary
had
brought
me
back
to
it
i
remember
that
as
we
walked
through
the
woodland
we
came
to
a
place
where
there
were
no
signs
of
war
elsewhere
there
were
men
busy
felling
trees
and
guns
and
an
occasional
transport
wagon
but
here
there
was
only
a
shallow
grassy
vale
and
in
the
distance
bloomed
over
like
a
plum
in
the
evening
haze
the
roofs
of
an
old
among
gardens
mary
clung
to
my
arm
as
we
drank
in
the
peace
of
it
is
what
lies
for
us
at
the
end
of
the
road
dick
she
said
softly
and
then
as
she
looked
i
felt
her
body
shiver
she
returned
to
the
strange
fancy
she
had
had
in
the
st
germains
woods
three
days
before
it
waiting
for
us
and
we
shall
certainly
find
it
but
first
we
must
go
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
and
there
is
the
sacrifice
to
be
made
the
best
of
us
chapter
fifteen
st
anton
ten
days
later
the
porter
joseph
zimmer
of
arosa
clad
in
the
tough
and
shapeless
trousers
of
his
class
but
sporting
an
old
velveteen
bequeathed
to
him
by
a
former
german
master
speaking
the
guttural
tongue
of
the
grisons
and
with
all
his
belongings
in
one
massive
rucksack
came
out
of
the
little
station
of
st
anton
and
blinked
in
the
frosty
sunshine
he
looked
down
upon
the
little
old
village
beside
its
icebound
lake
but
his
business
was
with
the
new
village
of
hotels
and
villas
which
had
sprung
up
in
the
last
ten
years
south
of
the
station
he
made
some
halting
inquiries
of
the
station
people
and
a
outside
finally
directed
him
to
the
place
he
sought
the
cottage
of
the
widow
summermatter
where
resided
an
english
intern
one
peter
pienaar
the
porter
joseph
zimmer
had
had
a
long
and
roundabout
journey
a
fortnight
before
he
had
worn
the
uniform
of
a
british
as
such
he
had
been
the
inmate
of
an
expensive
paris
hotel
till
one
morning
in
grey
tweed
clothes
and
with
a
limp
he
had
taken
the
express
with
a
ticket
for
an
officers
convalescent
home
at
cannes
thereafter
he
had
declined
in
the
social
scale
at
dijon
he
had
been
still
an
englishman
but
at
pontarlier
he
had
become
an
american
bagman
of
swiss
parentage
returning
to
wind
up
his
father
estate
at
berne
he
limped
excessively
and
at
zurich
at
a
little
hotel
he
became
frankly
the
peasant
for
he
met
a
friend
there
from
whom
he
acquired
clothes
with
that
odd
rank
smell
far
stronger
than
harris
tweed
which
marks
the
raiment
of
most
swiss
guides
and
all
swiss
porters
he
also
acquired
a
new
name
and
an
old
aunt
who
a
little
later
received
him
with
open
arms
and
explained
to
her
friends
that
he
was
her
brother
son
from
arosa
who
three
winters
ago
had
hurt
his
leg
and
had
been
discharged
from
the
levy
a
kindly
swiss
gentleman
as
it
chanced
had
heard
of
the
deserving
joseph
and
interested
himself
to
find
him
employment
the
said
philanthropist
made
a
hobby
of
the
french
and
british
prisoners
returned
from
germany
and
had
in
mind
an
officer
a
crabbed
south
african
with
a
bad
leg
who
needed
a
servant
he
was
it
seemed
an
old
fellow
who
had
to
be
billeted
alone
and
since
he
could
speak
german
he
would
be
happier
with
a
swiss
native
joseph
haggled
somewhat
over
the
wages
but
on
his
aunt
advice
he
accepted
the
job
and
with
a
very
complete
set
of
papers
and
a
store
of
reminiscences
it
took
him
some
time
to
swot
up
the
names
of
the
peaks
and
passes
he
had
traversed
set
out
for
st
anton
having
dispatched
beforehand
a
monstrously
letter
announcing
his
coming
he
could
barely
read
and
write
but
he
was
good
at
maps
which
he
had
studied
carefully
and
he
noticed
with
satisfaction
that
the
valley
of
st
anton
gave
easy
access
to
italy
as
he
journeyed
south
the
reflections
of
that
porter
would
have
surprised
his
fellow
travellers
in
the
stuffy
carriage
he
was
thinking
of
a
conversation
he
had
had
some
days
before
in
a
cafe
at
dijon
with
a
young
englishman
bound
for
modane
we
had
bumped
up
against
each
other
by
chance
in
that
strange
flitting
when
all
went
to
different
places
at
different
times
asking
nothing
of
each
other
business
wake
had
greeted
me
rather
shamefacedly
and
had
proposed
dinner
together
i
am
not
good
at
receiving
apologies
and
wake
embarrassed
me
more
than
they
embarrassed
him
a
bit
of
a
cad
sometimes
he
said
know
i
a
better
fellow
than
i
sounded
that
night
hannay
i
mumbled
something
about
not
talking
rot
the
conventional
phrase
what
worried
me
was
that
the
man
was
suffering
you
could
see
it
in
his
eyes
but
that
evening
i
got
nearer
wake
than
ever
before
and
he
and
i
became
true
friends
for
he
laid
bare
his
soul
before
me
that
was
his
trouble
that
he
could
lay
bare
his
soul
for
ordinary
healthy
folk
do
analyse
their
feelings
wake
did
and
i
think
it
brought
him
relief
think
i
was
ever
your
rival
i
would
no
more
have
proposed
to
mary
than
i
would
have
married
one
of
her
aunts
she
was
so
sure
of
herself
so
happy
in
her
that
she
terrified
me
my
type
of
man
is
not
meant
for
marriage
for
women
must
be
in
the
centre
of
life
and
we
must
always
be
standing
aside
and
looking
on
it
is
a
damnable
thing
to
be
trouble
about
you
my
dear
chap
i
said
that
you
too
hard
to
please
one
way
of
putting
it
i
should
put
it
more
harshly
i
hate
more
than
i
love
all
we
humanitarians
and
pacifists
have
hatred
as
our
mainspring
odd
is
it
for
people
who
preach
brotherly
love
but
it
the
truth
we
full
of
hate
towards
everything
that
square
in
with
our
ideas
everything
that
jars
on
our
nerves
fellows
like
you
are
so
in
love
with
their
cause
that
they
no
time
or
inclination
to
detest
what
thwarts
them
we
no
cause
only
negatives
and
that
means
hatred
and
and
a
beastly
jaundice
of
soul
then
i
knew
that
wake
fault
was
not
spiritual
pride
as
i
had
diagnosed
it
at
biggleswick
the
man
was
abased
with
humility
see
more
than
other
people
see
he
went
on
i
feel
more
that
the
curse
on
me
you
a
happy
man
and
you
get
things
done
because
you
only
see
one
side
of
a
case
one
thing
at
a
time
how
would
you
like
it
if
a
thousand
strings
were
always
tugging
at
you
if
you
saw
that
every
course
meant
the
sacrifice
of
lovely
and
desirable
things
or
even
the
shattering
of
what
you
know
to
be
unreplaceable
i
the
kind
of
stuff
poets
are
made
of
but
i
have
the
poet
gift
so
i
stagger
about
the
world
and
take
the
war
for
me
to
fight
would
be
worse
than
for
another
man
to
run
away
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
believe
that
it
need
have
happened
and
that
all
war
is
a
blistering
iniquity
and
yet
belief
has
got
very
little
to
do
with
virtue
i
not
as
good
a
man
as
you
hannay
who
have
never
thought
out
anything
in
your
life
my
time
in
the
labour
battalion
taught
me
something
i
knew
that
with
all
my
fine
aspirations
i
was
as
true
a
man
as
fellows
whose
talk
was
silly
oaths
and
who
did
care
a
tinker
curse
about
their
soul
i
remember
that
i
looked
at
him
with
a
sudden
understanding
think
i
know
you
you
the
sort
of
chap
who
wo
fight
for
his
country
because
he
ca
be
sure
that
she
altogether
in
the
right
but
cheerfully
die
for
her
right
or
wrong
his
face
relaxed
in
a
slow
smile
that
you
should
say
that
i
think
it
pretty
near
the
truth
men
like
me
are
afraid
to
die
but
they
have
quite
the
courage
to
live
every
man
should
be
happy
in
a
service
like
you
when
he
obeys
orders
i
could
get
on
in
any
service
i
lack
the
bump
of
veneration
i
ca
swallow
things
merely
because
i
told
to
my
sort
are
always
talking
about
service
but
we
have
the
temperament
to
serve
i
give
all
i
have
to
be
an
ordinary
cog
in
the
wheel
instead
of
a
confounded
outsider
who
finds
fault
with
the
machinery
take
a
great
violent
fellow
like
you
you
can
sink
yourself
till
you
become
only
a
name
and
a
number
i
if
i
tried
i
not
sure
if
i
want
to
either
i
cling
to
the
odds
and
ends
that
are
my
own
wish
i
had
had
you
in
my
battalion
a
year
ago
i
said
you
do
i
only
have
been
a
nuisance
i
been
a
fabian
since
oxford
but
you
a
better
socialist
than
me
i
a
rancid
individualist
you
must
be
feeling
better
about
the
war
i
asked
a
bit
of
it
i
still
lusting
for
the
heads
of
the
politicians
that
made
it
and
continue
it
but
i
want
to
help
my
country
honestly
hannay
i
love
the
old
place
more
i
think
than
i
love
myself
and
that
saying
a
devilish
lot
short
of
fighting
which
would
be
the
sin
against
the
holy
spirit
for
me
i
do
my
damnedest
but
remember
i
not
used
to
team
work
if
i
a
jealous
player
beat
me
over
the
head
his
voice
was
almost
wistful
and
i
liked
him
enormously
will
see
to
that
i
said
going
to
break
you
to
harness
wake
and
then
you
be
a
happy
man
you
keep
your
mind
on
the
game
and
forget
about
yourself
that
the
cure
for
jibbers
as
i
journeyed
to
st
anton
i
thought
a
lot
about
that
talk
he
was
quite
right
about
mary
who
would
never
have
married
him
a
man
with
such
an
angular
soul
could
fit
into
another
and
then
i
thought
that
the
chief
thing
about
mary
was
just
her
serene
certainty
her
eyes
had
that
settled
happy
look
that
i
remembered
to
have
seen
only
in
one
other
human
face
and
that
was
peter
but
i
wondered
if
eyes
were
still
the
same
i
found
the
cottage
a
little
wooden
thing
which
had
been
left
perched
on
its
knoll
when
the
big
hotels
grew
around
it
it
had
a
fence
in
front
but
behind
it
was
open
to
the
hillside
at
the
gate
stood
a
bent
old
woman
with
a
face
like
a
pippin
my
must
have
been
good
for
she
accepted
me
before
i
introduced
myself
be
thanked
you
are
come
she
cried
poor
lieutenant
needed
a
man
to
keep
him
company
he
sleeps
now
as
he
does
always
in
the
afternoon
for
his
leg
wearies
him
in
the
night
but
he
is
brave
like
a
soldier
come
i
will
show
you
the
house
for
you
two
will
be
alone
now
stepping
softly
she
led
me
indoors
pointing
with
a
warning
finger
to
the
little
bedroom
where
peter
slept
i
found
a
kitchen
with
a
big
stove
and
a
rough
floor
of
planking
on
which
lay
some
badly
cured
skins
off
it
was
a
sort
of
pantry
with
a
bed
for
me
she
showed
me
the
pots
and
pans
for
cooking
and
the
stores
she
had
laid
in
and
where
to
find
water
and
fuel
will
do
the
marketing
daily
she
said
if
you
need
me
my
dwelling
is
half
a
mile
up
the
road
beyond
the
new
church
god
be
with
you
young
man
and
be
kind
to
that
wounded
one
when
the
widow
summermatter
had
departed
i
sat
down
in
and
took
stock
of
the
place
it
was
quiet
and
simple
and
homely
and
through
the
window
came
the
gleam
of
snow
on
the
diamond
hills
on
the
table
beside
the
stove
were
peter
cherished
belongings
his
pouch
and
the
pipe
which
jannie
grobelaar
had
carved
for
him
in
st
helena
an
aluminium
field
i
had
given
him
a
cheap
bible
such
as
padres
present
to
privates
and
an
old
battered
with
gaudy
pictures
the
illustration
at
which
i
opened
showed
faithful
going
up
to
heaven
from
the
fire
of
vanity
fair
like
a
woodcock
that
has
just
been
flushed
everything
in
the
room
was
exquisitely
neat
and
i
knew
that
that
was
peter
and
not
the
widow
summermatter
on
a
peg
behind
the
door
hung
his
coat
and
sticking
out
of
a
pocket
i
recognized
a
sheaf
of
my
own
letters
in
one
corner
stood
something
which
i
had
forgotten
about
an
invalid
chair
the
sight
of
peter
plain
little
oddments
made
me
feel
solemn
i
wondered
if
his
eyes
would
be
like
mary
now
for
i
could
not
conceive
what
life
would
be
for
him
as
a
cripple
very
silently
i
opened
the
bedroom
door
and
slipped
inside
he
was
lying
on
a
camp
bedstead
with
one
of
those
striped
swiss
blankets
pulled
up
round
his
ears
and
he
was
asleep
it
was
the
old
peter
beyond
doubt
he
had
the
hunter
gift
of
breathing
evenly
through
his
nose
and
the
white
scar
on
the
deep
brown
of
his
forehead
was
what
i
had
always
remembered
the
only
change
since
i
last
saw
him
was
that
he
had
let
his
beard
grow
again
and
it
was
grey
as
i
looked
at
him
the
remembrance
of
all
we
had
been
through
together
flooded
back
upon
me
and
i
could
have
cried
with
joy
at
being
beside
him
women
bless
their
hearts
can
never
know
what
long
comradeship
means
to
men
it
is
something
not
in
their
lives
something
that
belongs
only
to
that
wild
undomesticated
world
which
we
forswear
when
we
find
our
mates
even
mary
understood
only
a
bit
of
it
i
had
just
won
her
love
which
was
the
greatest
thing
that
ever
came
my
way
but
if
she
had
entered
at
that
moment
i
would
scarcely
have
turned
my
head
i
was
back
again
in
the
old
life
and
was
not
thinking
of
the
new
suddenly
i
saw
that
peter
was
awake
and
was
looking
at
me
he
said
in
a
whisper
my
old
friend
the
blanket
was
tossed
off
and
his
long
lean
arms
were
stretched
out
to
me
i
gripped
his
hands
and
for
a
little
we
did
not
speak
then
i
saw
how
woefully
he
had
changed
his
left
leg
had
shrunk
and
from
the
knee
down
was
like
a
pipe
stem
his
face
when
awake
showed
the
lines
of
hard
suffering
and
he
seemed
shorter
by
half
a
foot
but
his
eyes
were
still
like
mary
indeed
they
seemed
to
be
more
patient
and
peaceful
than
in
the
days
when
he
sat
beside
me
on
the
and
peered
over
the
i
picked
him
up
he
was
no
heavier
than
mary
and
carried
him
to
his
chair
beside
the
stove
then
i
boiled
water
and
made
tea
as
we
had
so
often
done
together
old
man
i
said
on
trek
again
and
this
is
a
very
snug
little
we
had
many
good
yarns
but
this
is
going
to
be
the
best
first
of
all
how
about
your
health
i
a
strong
man
again
but
slow
like
a
hippo
cow
i
have
been
lonely
sometimes
but
that
is
all
by
now
tell
me
of
the
big
battles
but
i
was
hungry
for
news
of
him
and
kept
him
to
his
own
case
he
had
no
complaint
of
his
treatment
except
that
he
did
not
like
germans
the
doctors
at
the
hospital
had
been
clever
he
said
and
had
done
their
best
for
him
but
nerves
and
sinews
and
small
bones
had
been
so
wrecked
that
they
could
not
mend
his
leg
and
peter
had
all
the
boer
dislike
of
amputation
one
doctor
had
been
in
damaraland
and
talked
to
him
of
those
baked
sunny
places
and
made
him
homesick
but
he
returned
always
to
his
dislike
of
germans
he
had
seen
them
herding
our
soldiers
like
brute
beasts
and
the
commandant
had
a
face
like
stumm
and
a
chin
that
stuck
out
and
wanted
hitting
he
made
an
exception
for
the
great
airman
lensch
who
had
downed
him
is
a
white
man
that
one
he
said
came
to
see
me
in
hospital
and
told
me
a
lot
of
things
i
think
he
made
them
treat
me
well
he
is
a
big
man
dick
who
would
make
two
of
me
and
he
has
a
round
merry
face
and
pale
eyes
like
frickie
celliers
who
could
put
a
bullet
through
a
pauw
head
at
two
hundred
yards
he
said
he
was
sorry
i
was
lame
for
he
hoped
to
have
more
fights
with
me
some
woman
that
tells
fortunes
had
said
that
i
would
be
the
end
of
him
but
he
reckoned
she
had
got
the
thing
the
wrong
way
on
i
hope
he
will
come
through
this
war
for
he
is
a
good
man
though
a
german
but
the
others
they
are
like
the
fool
in
the
bible
fat
and
ugly
in
good
fortune
and
proud
and
vicious
when
their
luck
goes
they
are
not
a
people
to
be
happy
with
then
he
told
me
that
to
keep
up
his
spirits
he
had
amused
himself
with
playing
a
game
he
had
prided
himself
on
being
a
boer
and
spoken
coldly
of
the
british
he
had
also
i
gathered
imparted
many
things
calculated
to
deceive
so
he
left
germany
with
good
marks
and
in
switzerland
had
held
himself
aloof
from
the
other
british
wounded
on
the
advice
of
blenkiron
who
had
met
him
as
soon
as
he
crossed
the
frontier
i
gathered
it
was
blenkiron
who
had
had
him
sent
to
st
anton
and
in
his
time
there
as
a
disgruntled
boer
he
had
mixed
a
good
deal
with
germans
they
had
pumped
him
about
our
air
service
and
peter
had
told
them
many
ingenious
lies
and
heard
curious
things
in
return
are
working
hard
dick
he
said
forget
that
the
german
is
a
stout
enemy
and
when
we
beat
him
with
a
machine
he
sweats
till
he
has
invented
a
new
one
they
have
great
pilots
but
never
so
many
good
ones
as
we
and
i
do
not
think
in
ordinary
fighting
they
can
ever
beat
us
but
you
must
watch
lensch
for
i
fear
him
he
has
a
new
machine
i
hear
with
great
engines
and
a
short
wingspread
but
the
wings
so
cambered
that
he
can
climb
fast
that
will
be
a
surprise
to
spring
upon
us
you
will
say
that
we
soon
better
it
so
we
shall
but
if
it
was
used
at
a
time
when
we
were
pushing
hard
it
might
make
the
little
difference
that
loses
battles
mean
i
said
if
we
had
a
great
attack
ready
and
had
driven
all
the
boche
planes
back
from
our
front
lensch
and
his
circus
might
get
over
in
spite
of
us
and
blow
the
gaff
he
said
solemnly
if
we
were
attacked
and
had
a
weak
spot
lensch
might
show
the
germans
where
to
get
through
i
do
not
think
we
are
going
to
attack
for
a
long
time
but
i
am
pretty
sure
that
germany
is
going
to
fling
every
man
against
us
that
is
the
talk
of
my
friends
and
it
is
not
bluff
that
night
i
cooked
our
modest
dinner
and
we
smoked
our
pipes
with
the
stove
door
open
and
the
good
smell
of
woodsmoke
in
our
nostrils
i
told
him
of
all
my
doings
and
of
the
wild
birds
and
ivery
and
the
job
we
were
engaged
on
blenkiron
instructions
were
that
we
two
should
live
humbly
and
keep
our
eyes
and
ears
open
for
we
were
outside
suspicion
the
cantankerous
lame
boer
and
his
loutish
servant
from
arosa
somewhere
in
the
place
was
a
rendezvous
of
our
enemies
and
thither
came
chelius
on
his
dark
errands
peter
nodded
his
head
sagely
think
i
have
guessed
the
place
the
daughter
of
the
old
woman
used
to
pull
my
chair
sometimes
down
to
the
village
and
i
have
sat
in
cheap
inns
and
talked
to
servants
there
is
a
pan
there
it
is
all
covered
with
snow
now
and
beside
it
there
is
a
big
house
that
they
call
the
pink
chalet
i
do
not
know
much
about
it
except
that
rich
folk
live
in
it
for
i
know
the
other
houses
and
they
are
harmless
also
the
big
hotels
which
are
too
cold
and
public
for
strangers
to
meet
in
i
put
peter
to
bed
and
it
was
a
joy
to
me
to
look
after
him
to
give
him
his
tonic
and
prepare
the
hot
water
bottle
that
comforted
his
neuralgia
his
behaviour
was
like
a
docile
child
and
he
never
lapsed
from
his
sunny
temper
though
i
could
see
how
his
leg
gave
him
hell
they
had
tried
massage
for
it
and
given
it
up
and
there
was
nothing
for
him
but
to
endure
till
nature
and
his
tough
constitution
deadened
the
tortured
nerves
again
i
shifted
my
bed
out
of
the
pantry
and
slept
in
the
room
with
him
and
when
i
woke
in
the
night
as
one
does
the
first
time
in
a
strange
place
i
could
tell
by
his
breathing
that
he
was
wakeful
and
suffering
next
day
a
bath
chair
containing
a
grizzled
cripple
and
pushed
by
a
limping
peasant
might
have
been
seen
descending
the
long
hill
to
the
village
it
was
clear
frosty
weather
which
makes
the
cheeks
tingle
and
i
felt
so
full
of
beans
that
it
was
hard
to
remember
my
game
leg
the
valley
was
shut
in
on
the
east
by
a
great
mass
of
rocks
and
glaciers
belonging
to
a
mountain
whose
top
could
not
be
seen
but
on
the
south
above
the
snowy
there
was
a
most
delicate
peak
with
a
point
like
a
needle
i
looked
at
it
with
interest
for
beyond
it
lay
the
valley
which
led
to
the
staub
pass
and
beyond
that
was
italy
and
mary
the
old
village
of
st
anton
had
one
long
narrow
street
which
bent
at
right
angles
to
a
bridge
which
spanned
the
river
flowing
from
the
lake
thence
the
road
climbed
steeply
but
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
it
ran
on
the
level
by
the
water
edge
lined
with
gimcrack
now
shuttered
to
the
world
and
a
few
villas
in
patches
of
garden
at
the
far
end
just
before
it
plunged
into
a
a
promontory
jutted
into
the
lake
leaving
a
broad
space
between
the
road
and
the
water
here
were
the
grounds
of
a
more
considerable
dwelling
laurels
and
rhododendrons
with
one
or
two
bigger
trees
and
just
on
the
stood
the
house
itself
called
the
pink
chalet
i
wheeled
peter
past
the
entrance
on
the
crackling
snow
of
the
highway
seen
through
the
gaps
of
the
trees
the
front
looked
new
but
the
back
part
seemed
to
be
of
some
age
for
i
could
see
high
walls
broken
by
few
windows
hanging
over
the
water
the
place
was
no
more
a
chalet
than
a
donjon
but
i
suppose
the
name
was
given
in
honour
of
a
wooden
gallery
above
the
front
door
the
whole
thing
was
washed
in
an
ugly
pink
there
were
outhouses
garage
or
stables
among
the
trees
and
at
the
entrance
there
were
fairly
recent
tracks
of
an
automobile
on
our
way
back
we
had
some
very
bad
beer
in
a
cafe
and
made
friends
with
the
woman
who
kept
it
peter
had
to
tell
her
his
story
and
i
trotted
out
my
aunt
in
zurich
and
in
the
end
we
heard
her
grievances
she
was
a
true
swiss
angry
at
all
the
belligerents
who
had
spoiled
her
livelihood
hating
germany
most
but
also
fearing
her
most
coffee
tea
fuel
bread
even
milk
and
cheese
were
hard
to
get
and
cost
a
ransom
it
would
take
the
land
years
to
recover
and
there
would
be
no
more
tourists
for
there
was
little
money
left
in
the
world
i
dropped
a
question
about
the
pink
chalet
and
was
told
that
it
belonged
to
one
schweigler
a
professor
of
berne
an
old
man
who
came
sometimes
for
a
few
days
in
the
summer
it
was
often
let
but
not
now
asked
if
it
was
occupied
she
remarked
that
some
friends
of
the
schweiglers
rich
people
from
basle
had
been
there
for
the
winter
come
and
go
in
great
cars
she
said
bitterly
they
bring
their
food
from
the
cities
they
spend
no
money
in
this
poor
place
presently
peter
and
i
fell
into
a
routine
of
life
as
if
we
had
always
kept
house
together
in
the
morning
he
went
abroad
in
his
chair
in
the
afternoon
i
would
hobble
about
on
my
own
errands
we
sank
into
the
background
and
took
its
colour
and
a
less
conspicuous
pair
never
faced
the
eye
of
suspicion
once
a
week
a
young
swiss
officer
whose
business
it
was
to
look
after
british
wounded
paid
us
a
hurried
visit
i
used
to
get
letters
from
my
aunt
in
zurich
sometimes
with
the
postmark
of
arosa
and
now
and
then
these
letters
would
contain
curiously
worded
advice
or
instructions
from
him
whom
my
aunt
called
kind
patron
generally
i
was
told
to
be
patient
sometimes
i
had
word
about
the
health
of
little
cousin
across
the
mountains
once
i
was
bidden
expect
a
friend
of
the
patron
the
wise
doctor
of
whom
he
had
often
spoken
but
though
after
that
i
shadowed
the
pink
chalet
for
two
days
no
doctor
appeared
my
investigations
were
a
barren
business
i
used
to
go
down
to
the
village
in
the
afternoon
and
sit
in
an
cafe
talking
slow
german
with
peasants
and
hotel
porters
but
there
was
little
to
learn
i
knew
all
there
was
to
hear
about
the
pink
chalet
and
that
was
nothing
a
young
man
who
stayed
for
three
nights
and
spent
his
days
on
the
alps
above
the
a
party
of
four
including
two
women
was
reported
to
have
been
there
for
a
night
all
ramifications
of
the
rich
family
of
basle
i
studied
the
house
from
the
lake
which
should
have
been
nicely
swept
into
but
from
lack
of
visitors
was
a
heap
of
blown
snow
the
high
old
walls
of
the
back
part
were
built
straight
from
the
water
edge
i
remember
i
tried
a
short
cut
through
the
grounds
to
the
and
was
given
afternoon
by
a
smiling
german
manservant
one
way
and
another
i
gathered
there
were
a
good
many
about
the
place
too
many
for
the
infrequent
guests
but
beyond
this
i
discovered
nothing
not
that
i
was
bored
for
i
had
always
peter
to
turn
to
he
was
thinking
a
lot
about
south
africa
and
the
thing
he
liked
best
was
to
go
over
with
me
every
detail
of
our
old
expeditions
they
belonged
to
a
life
which
he
could
think
about
without
pain
whereas
the
war
was
too
near
and
bitter
for
him
he
liked
to
hobble
after
the
darkness
came
and
look
at
his
old
friends
the
stars
he
called
them
by
the
words
they
use
on
the
veld
and
the
first
star
of
morning
he
called
the
the
little
boy
who
inspans
the
oxen
a
name
i
had
not
heard
for
twenty
years
many
a
great
yarn
we
spun
in
the
long
evenings
but
i
always
went
to
bed
with
a
sore
heart
the
longing
in
his
eyes
was
too
urgent
longing
not
for
old
days
or
far
countries
but
for
the
health
and
strength
which
had
once
been
his
pride
one
night
i
told
him
about
mary
will
be
a
happy
he
said
you
will
need
to
be
very
clever
with
her
for
women
are
queer
cattle
and
you
and
i
do
know
their
ways
they
tell
me
english
women
do
not
cook
and
make
clothes
like
our
vrouws
so
what
will
she
find
to
do
i
doubt
an
idle
woman
will
be
like
a
horse
it
was
no
good
explaining
to
him
the
kind
of
girl
mary
was
for
that
was
a
world
entirely
beyond
his
ken
but
i
could
see
that
he
felt
lonelier
than
ever
at
my
news
so
i
told
him
of
the
house
i
meant
to
have
in
england
when
the
war
was
over
an
old
house
in
a
green
hilly
country
with
fields
that
would
carry
four
head
of
cattle
to
the
morgan
and
furrows
of
clear
water
and
orchards
of
plums
and
apples
you
will
stay
with
us
all
the
time
i
said
will
have
your
own
rooms
and
your
own
boy
to
look
after
you
and
you
will
help
me
to
farm
and
we
will
catch
fish
together
and
shoot
the
wild
ducks
when
they
come
up
from
the
pans
in
the
evening
i
have
found
a
better
countryside
than
the
houtbosch
where
you
and
i
planned
to
have
a
farm
it
is
a
blessed
and
happy
place
england
he
shook
his
head
are
a
kind
man
dick
but
your
pretty
wo
want
an
ugly
old
fellow
like
me
hobbling
about
her
house
i
do
not
think
i
will
go
back
to
africa
for
i
should
be
sad
there
in
the
sun
i
will
find
a
little
place
in
england
and
some
day
i
will
visit
you
old
friend
that
night
his
stoicism
seemed
for
the
first
time
to
fail
him
he
was
silent
for
a
long
time
and
went
early
to
bed
where
i
can
vouch
for
it
he
did
not
sleep
but
he
must
have
thought
a
lot
in
the
night
time
for
in
the
morning
he
had
got
himself
in
hand
and
was
as
cheerful
as
a
sandboy
i
watched
his
philosophy
with
amazement
it
was
far
beyond
anything
i
could
have
compassed
myself
he
was
so
frail
and
so
poor
for
he
had
never
had
anything
in
the
world
but
his
bodily
fitness
and
he
had
lost
that
now
and
remember
he
had
lost
it
after
some
months
of
glittering
happiness
for
in
the
air
he
had
found
the
element
for
which
he
had
been
born
sometimes
he
dropped
a
hint
of
those
days
when
he
lived
in
the
clouds
and
invented
a
new
kind
of
battle
and
his
voice
always
grew
hoarse
i
could
see
that
he
ached
with
longing
for
their
return
and
yet
he
never
had
a
word
of
complaint
that
was
the
ritual
he
had
set
himself
his
point
of
honour
and
he
faced
the
future
with
the
same
kind
of
courage
as
that
with
which
he
had
tackled
a
wild
beast
or
lensch
himself
only
it
needed
a
far
bigger
brand
of
fortitude
another
thing
was
that
he
had
found
religion
i
doubt
if
that
is
the
right
way
to
put
it
for
he
had
always
had
it
men
who
live
in
the
wilds
know
they
are
in
the
hands
of
god
but
his
old
kind
had
been
a
tattered
thing
more
like
heathen
superstition
though
it
had
always
kept
him
humble
but
now
he
had
taken
to
reading
the
bible
and
to
thinking
in
his
lonely
nights
and
he
had
got
a
creed
of
his
own
i
dare
say
it
was
crude
enough
i
am
sure
it
was
unorthodox
but
if
the
proof
of
religion
is
that
it
gives
a
man
a
prop
in
bad
days
then
peter
was
the
real
thing
he
used
to
ferret
about
in
the
bible
and
the
they
were
both
equally
inspired
in
his
eyes
and
find
texts
which
he
interpreted
in
his
own
way
to
meet
his
case
he
took
everything
quite
literally
what
happened
three
thousand
years
ago
in
palestine
might
for
all
he
minded
have
been
going
on
next
door
i
used
to
chaff
him
and
tell
him
that
he
was
like
the
kaiser
very
good
at
fitting
the
bible
to
his
purpose
but
his
sincerity
was
so
complete
that
he
only
smiled
i
remember
one
night
when
he
had
been
thinking
about
his
flying
days
he
found
a
passage
in
thessalonians
about
the
dead
rising
to
meet
their
lord
in
the
air
and
that
cheered
him
a
lot
peter
i
could
see
had
the
notion
that
his
time
here
would
be
very
long
and
he
liked
to
think
that
when
he
got
his
release
he
would
find
once
more
the
old
rapture
once
when
i
said
something
about
his
patience
he
said
he
had
got
to
try
to
live
up
to
mr
standfast
he
had
fixed
on
that
character
to
follow
though
he
would
have
preferred
mr
if
he
had
thought
himself
good
enough
he
used
to
talk
about
mr
standfast
in
his
queer
way
as
if
he
were
a
friend
of
us
both
like
blenkiron
i
tell
you
i
was
humbled
out
of
all
my
pride
by
the
sight
of
peter
so
uncomplaining
and
gentle
and
wise
the
almighty
himself
could
have
made
a
prig
out
of
him
and
he
never
would
have
thought
of
preaching
only
once
did
he
give
me
advice
i
had
always
a
liking
for
short
cuts
and
i
was
getting
a
bit
restive
under
the
long
inaction
one
day
when
i
expressed
my
feelings
on
the
matter
peter
upped
and
read
from
the
also
have
wished
that
the
next
way
to
their
father
house
were
here
that
they
might
be
troubled
no
more
with
either
hills
or
mountains
to
go
over
but
the
way
is
the
way
and
there
is
an
end
all
the
same
when
we
got
into
march
and
nothing
happened
i
grew
pretty
anxious
blenkiron
had
said
we
were
fighting
against
time
and
here
were
the
weeks
slipping
away
his
letters
came
occasionally
always
in
the
shape
of
communications
from
my
aunt
one
told
me
that
i
would
soon
be
out
of
a
job
for
peter
repatriation
was
just
about
through
and
he
might
get
his
movement
order
any
day
another
spoke
of
my
little
cousin
over
the
hills
and
said
that
she
hoped
soon
to
be
going
to
a
place
called
santa
chiara
in
the
val
saluzzana
i
got
out
the
map
in
a
hurry
and
measured
the
distance
from
there
to
st
anton
and
pored
over
the
two
roads
thither
the
short
one
by
the
staub
pass
and
the
long
one
by
the
marjolana
these
letters
made
me
think
that
things
were
nearing
a
climax
but
still
no
instructions
came
i
had
nothing
to
report
in
my
own
messages
i
had
discovered
nothing
in
the
pink
chalet
but
idle
servants
i
was
not
even
sure
if
the
pink
chalet
were
not
a
harmless
villa
and
i
had
come
within
a
thousand
miles
of
finding
chelius
all
my
desire
to
imitate
peter
stoicism
did
prevent
me
from
getting
occasionally
rattled
and
despondent
the
one
thing
i
could
do
was
to
keep
fit
for
i
had
a
notion
i
might
soon
want
all
my
bodily
strength
i
had
to
keep
up
my
pretence
of
lameness
in
the
daytime
so
i
used
to
take
my
exercise
at
night
i
would
sleep
in
the
afternoon
when
peter
had
his
siesta
and
then
about
ten
in
the
evening
after
putting
him
to
bed
i
would
slip
and
go
for
a
four
or
five
hours
tramp
wonderful
were
those
midnight
wanderings
i
pushed
up
through
the
pines
to
the
ridges
where
the
snow
lay
in
great
wreaths
and
scallops
till
i
stood
on
a
crest
with
a
frozen
world
at
my
feet
and
above
me
a
host
of
glittering
stars
once
on
a
night
of
full
moon
i
reached
the
glacier
at
the
valley
head
scrambled
up
the
moraine
to
where
the
ice
began
and
peered
fearfully
into
the
spectral
crevasses
at
such
hours
i
had
the
earth
to
myself
for
there
was
not
a
sound
except
the
slipping
of
a
burden
of
snow
from
the
trees
or
the
crack
and
rustle
which
reminded
me
that
a
glacier
was
a
moving
river
the
war
seemed
very
far
away
and
i
felt
the
littleness
of
our
human
struggles
till
i
thought
of
peter
turning
from
side
to
side
to
find
ease
in
the
cottage
far
below
me
then
i
realized
that
the
spirit
of
man
was
the
greatest
thing
in
this
spacious
world
i
would
get
back
about
three
or
four
have
a
bath
in
the
water
which
had
been
warming
in
my
absence
and
creep
into
bed
almost
ashamed
of
having
two
sound
legs
when
a
better
man
a
yard
away
had
but
one
oddly
enough
at
these
hours
there
seemed
more
life
in
the
pink
chalet
than
by
day
once
tramping
across
the
lake
long
after
midnight
i
saw
lights
in
the
in
windows
which
for
ordinary
were
blank
and
shuttered
several
times
i
cut
across
the
grounds
when
the
moon
was
dark
on
one
such
occasion
a
great
car
with
no
lights
swept
up
the
drive
and
i
heard
low
voices
at
the
door
another
time
a
man
ran
hastily
past
me
and
entered
the
house
by
a
little
door
on
the
eastern
side
which
i
had
not
before
noticed
slowly
the
conviction
began
to
grow
on
me
that
we
were
not
wrong
in
marking
down
this
place
that
things
went
on
within
it
which
it
deeply
concerned
us
to
discover
but
i
was
puzzled
to
think
of
a
way
i
might
butt
inside
but
for
all
i
knew
it
would
be
upsetting
blenkiron
plans
for
he
had
given
me
no
instructions
about
housebreaking
all
this
unsettled
me
worse
than
ever
i
began
to
lie
awake
planning
some
means
of
entrance
i
would
be
a
peasant
from
the
next
valley
who
had
twisted
his
ankle
i
would
go
seeking
an
imaginary
cousin
among
the
servants
i
would
start
a
fire
in
the
place
and
have
the
doors
flung
open
to
zealous
neighbours
and
then
suddenly
i
got
instructions
in
a
letter
from
blenkiron
it
came
inside
a
parcel
of
warm
socks
that
arrived
from
my
kind
aunt
but
the
letter
for
me
was
not
from
her
it
was
in
blenkiron
large
sprawling
hand
and
the
style
of
it
was
all
his
own
he
told
me
that
he
had
about
finished
his
job
he
had
got
his
line
on
chelius
who
was
the
bird
he
expected
and
that
bird
would
soon
wing
its
way
southward
across
the
mountains
for
the
reason
i
knew
of
got
an
almighty
move
on
he
wrote
please
god
you
going
to
hustle
some
in
the
next
week
it
going
better
than
i
ever
hoped
but
something
was
still
to
be
done
he
had
struck
a
countryman
one
clarence
donne
a
journalist
of
kansas
city
whom
he
had
taken
into
the
business
him
he
described
as
a
and
commended
to
my
esteem
he
was
coming
to
st
anton
for
there
was
a
game
afoot
at
the
pink
chalet
which
he
would
give
me
news
of
i
was
to
meet
him
next
evening
at
at
the
little
door
in
the
east
end
of
the
house
the
love
of
mike
dick
he
concluded
on
time
and
do
everything
clarence
tells
you
as
if
he
was
me
it
a
mighty
complex
affair
but
you
and
he
have
sand
enough
to
pull
through
do
worry
about
your
little
cousin
she
safe
and
out
of
the
job
now
my
first
feeling
was
one
of
immense
relief
especially
at
the
last
words
i
read
the
letter
a
dozen
times
to
make
sure
i
had
its
meaning
a
flash
of
suspicion
crossed
my
mind
that
it
might
be
a
fake
principally
because
there
was
no
mention
of
peter
who
had
figured
large
in
the
other
missives
but
why
should
peter
be
mentioned
when
he
was
on
in
this
piece
the
signature
convinced
me
ordinarily
blenkiron
signed
himself
in
full
with
a
fine
commercial
flourish
but
when
i
was
at
the
front
he
had
got
into
the
habit
of
making
a
kind
of
hieroglyphic
of
his
surname
to
me
and
sticking
after
it
in
a
bracket
that
was
how
this
letter
was
signed
and
it
was
sure
proof
it
was
all
right
i
spent
that
day
and
the
next
in
wild
spirits
peter
spotted
what
was
on
though
i
did
not
tell
him
for
fear
of
making
him
envious
i
had
to
be
extra
kind
to
him
for
i
could
see
that
he
ached
to
have
a
hand
in
the
business
indeed
he
asked
shyly
if
i
could
fit
him
in
and
i
had
to
lie
about
it
and
say
it
was
only
another
of
my
aimless
circumnavigations
of
the
pink
chalet
and
find
something
where
i
can
help
he
pleaded
pretty
strong
still
though
i
lame
and
i
can
shoot
a
bit
i
declared
that
he
would
be
used
in
time
that
blenkiron
had
promised
he
would
be
used
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
see
how
at
nine
on
the
evening
appointed
i
was
on
the
lake
opposite
the
house
close
in
under
the
shore
making
my
way
to
the
rendezvous
it
was
a
night
for
though
the
air
was
clear
the
stars
were
shining
with
little
light
and
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
with
a
premonition
that
i
might
be
long
away
from
food
i
had
brought
some
slabs
of
chocolate
and
my
pistol
and
torch
were
in
my
pocket
it
was
bitter
cold
but
i
had
ceased
to
mind
weather
and
i
wore
my
one
suit
and
no
overcoat
the
house
was
like
a
tomb
for
silence
there
was
no
crack
of
light
anywhere
and
none
of
those
smells
of
smoke
and
food
which
proclaim
habitation
it
was
an
eerie
job
scrambling
up
the
steep
bank
east
of
the
place
to
where
the
flat
of
the
garden
started
in
a
darkness
so
great
that
i
had
to
grope
my
way
like
a
blind
man
i
found
the
little
door
by
feeling
along
the
edge
of
the
building
then
i
stepped
into
an
adjacent
clump
of
laurels
to
wait
on
my
companion
he
was
there
before
me
i
heard
a
rich
middle
west
voice
whisper
you
joseph
zimmer
i
not
shouting
any
names
but
i
guess
you
are
the
guy
i
was
told
to
meet
here
donne
i
whispered
back
same
he
replied
i
gripped
a
gloved
and
mittened
hand
which
drew
me
towards
the
door
chapter
sixteen
i
lie
on
a
hard
bed
the
journalist
from
kansas
city
was
a
man
of
action
he
wasted
no
words
in
introducing
himself
or
unfolding
his
plan
of
campaign
got
to
follow
me
mister
and
not
deviate
one
inch
from
my
tracks
the
explaining
part
will
come
later
there
big
business
in
this
shack
tonight
he
unlocked
the
little
door
with
scarcely
a
sound
slid
the
crust
of
snow
from
his
boots
and
preceded
me
into
a
passage
as
black
as
a
cellar
the
door
swung
smoothly
behind
us
and
after
the
sharp
the
air
smelt
stuffy
as
the
inside
of
a
safe
a
hand
reached
back
to
make
sure
that
i
followed
we
appeared
to
be
in
a
flagged
passage
under
the
main
level
of
the
house
my
hobnailed
boots
slipped
on
the
floor
and
i
steadied
myself
on
the
wall
which
seemed
to
be
of
undressed
stone
mr
donne
moved
softly
and
assuredly
for
he
was
better
shod
for
the
job
than
me
and
his
guiding
hand
came
back
constantly
to
make
sure
of
my
whereabouts
i
remember
that
i
felt
just
as
i
had
felt
when
on
that
august
night
i
had
explored
the
crevice
of
the
coolin
the
same
sense
that
something
queer
was
going
to
happen
the
same
recklessness
and
contentment
moving
a
foot
at
a
time
with
immense
care
we
came
to
a
turning
two
shallow
steps
led
us
to
another
passage
and
then
my
groping
hands
struck
a
blind
wall
the
american
was
beside
me
and
his
mouth
was
close
to
my
ear
to
crawl
now
he
whispered
lead
mister
while
i
shed
this
coat
of
mine
eight
feet
on
your
stomach
and
then
upright
i
wriggled
through
a
low
tunnel
broad
enough
to
take
three
men
abreast
but
not
two
feet
high
through
i
felt
suffocated
for
i
never
liked
holes
and
i
had
a
momentary
anxiety
as
to
what
we
were
after
in
this
cellar
pilgrimage
presently
i
smelt
free
air
and
got
on
to
my
knees
mister
came
a
whisper
from
behind
my
companion
seemed
to
be
waiting
till
i
was
through
before
he
followed
i
answered
and
very
carefully
rose
to
my
feet
then
something
happened
behind
me
there
was
a
jar
and
a
bump
as
if
the
roof
of
the
tunnel
had
subsided
i
turned
sharply
and
groped
at
the
mouth
i
stuck
my
leg
down
and
found
a
block
i
said
as
loud
as
i
dared
you
hurt
where
are
you
but
no
answer
came
even
then
i
thought
only
of
an
accident
something
had
miscarried
and
i
was
cut
off
in
the
cellars
of
an
unfriendly
house
away
from
the
man
who
knew
the
road
and
had
a
plan
in
his
head
i
was
not
so
much
frightened
as
exasperated
i
turned
from
the
and
groped
into
the
darkness
before
me
i
might
as
well
prospect
the
kind
of
prison
into
which
i
had
blundered
i
took
three
steps
no
more
my
feet
seemed
suddenly
to
go
from
me
and
fly
upward
so
sudden
was
it
that
i
fell
heavy
and
dead
like
a
log
and
my
head
struck
the
floor
with
a
crash
that
for
a
moment
knocked
me
senseless
i
was
conscious
of
something
falling
on
me
and
of
an
intolerable
pressure
on
my
chest
i
struggled
for
breath
and
found
my
arms
and
legs
pinned
and
my
whole
body
in
a
kind
of
wooden
vice
i
was
sick
with
concussion
and
could
do
nothing
but
gasp
and
choke
down
my
nausea
the
cut
in
the
back
of
my
head
was
bleeding
freely
and
that
helped
to
clear
my
wits
but
i
lay
for
a
minute
or
two
incapable
of
thought
i
shut
my
eyes
tight
as
a
man
does
when
he
is
fighting
with
a
swoon
when
i
opened
them
there
was
light
it
came
from
the
left
side
of
the
room
the
broad
glare
of
a
strong
electric
torch
i
watched
it
stupidly
but
it
gave
me
the
fillip
needed
to
pick
up
the
threads
i
remembered
the
tunnel
now
and
the
kansas
journalist
then
behind
the
light
i
saw
a
face
which
pulled
my
flickering
senses
out
of
the
mire
i
saw
the
heavy
ulster
and
the
cap
which
i
had
realized
though
i
had
not
seen
outside
in
the
dark
laurels
they
belonged
to
the
journalist
clarence
donne
the
trusted
emissary
of
blenkiron
but
i
saw
his
face
now
and
it
was
that
face
which
i
had
boasted
to
bullivant
i
could
never
mistake
again
upon
earth
i
did
not
mistake
it
now
and
i
remember
i
had
a
faint
satisfaction
that
i
had
made
good
my
word
i
had
not
mistaken
it
for
i
had
not
had
the
chance
to
look
at
it
till
this
moment
i
saw
with
acid
clearness
the
common
denominator
of
all
its
disguises
the
young
man
who
lisped
in
the
seaside
villa
the
stout
philanthropist
of
biggleswick
the
pulpy
creature
of
the
tube
station
the
trim
french
staff
officer
of
the
picardy
chateau
i
saw
more
for
i
saw
it
beyond
the
need
of
disguise
i
was
looking
at
von
schwabing
the
exile
who
had
done
more
for
germany
than
any
army
commander
mary
words
came
back
to
me
most
dangerous
man
in
the
world
i
was
not
afraid
or
at
failure
or
angry
not
yet
for
i
was
too
dazed
and
awestruck
i
looked
at
him
as
one
might
look
at
some
cataclysm
of
nature
which
had
destroyed
a
continent
the
face
was
smiling
am
happy
to
offer
you
hospitality
at
last
it
said
i
pulled
my
wits
farther
out
of
the
mud
to
attend
to
him
the
on
my
chest
pressed
less
hard
and
i
breathed
better
but
when
i
tried
to
speak
the
words
would
not
come
are
old
friends
he
went
on
have
known
each
other
quite
intimately
for
four
years
which
is
a
long
time
in
war
i
have
been
interested
in
you
for
you
have
a
kind
of
crude
intelligence
and
you
have
compelled
me
to
take
you
seriously
if
you
were
cleverer
you
would
appreciate
the
compliment
but
you
were
fool
enough
to
think
you
could
beat
me
and
for
that
you
must
be
punished
oh
no
do
flatter
yourself
you
were
ever
dangerous
you
were
only
troublesome
and
presumptuous
like
a
mosquito
one
flicks
off
one
sleeve
he
was
leaning
against
the
side
of
a
heavy
closed
door
he
lit
a
cigar
from
a
little
gold
tinder
box
and
regarded
me
with
amused
eyes
will
have
time
for
reflection
so
i
propose
to
enlighten
you
a
little
you
are
an
observer
of
little
things
so
did
you
ever
see
a
cat
with
a
mouse
the
mouse
runs
about
and
hides
and
manoeuvres
and
thinks
it
is
playing
its
own
game
but
at
any
moment
the
cat
can
stretch
out
its
paw
and
put
an
end
to
it
you
are
the
mouse
my
poor
general
for
i
believe
you
are
one
of
those
funny
amateurs
that
the
english
call
generals
at
any
moment
during
the
last
nine
months
i
could
have
put
an
end
to
you
with
a
nod
my
nausea
had
stopped
and
i
could
understand
what
he
said
though
i
had
still
no
power
to
reply
me
explain
he
went
on
watched
with
amusement
your
gambols
at
biggleswick
my
eyes
followed
you
when
you
went
to
the
clyde
and
in
your
stupid
twistings
in
scotland
i
gave
you
rope
because
you
were
futile
and
i
had
graver
things
to
attend
to
i
allowed
you
to
amuse
yourself
at
your
british
front
with
childish
investigations
and
to
play
the
fool
in
paris
i
have
followed
every
step
of
your
course
in
switzerland
and
i
have
helped
your
idiotic
yankee
friend
to
plot
against
myself
while
you
thought
you
were
drawing
your
net
around
me
i
was
drawing
mine
around
you
i
assure
you
it
has
been
a
charming
relaxation
from
serious
business
i
knew
the
man
was
lying
some
part
was
true
for
he
had
clearly
fooled
blenkiron
but
i
remembered
the
hurried
flight
from
biggleswick
and
eaucourt
when
the
game
was
certainly
against
him
he
had
me
at
his
mercy
and
was
wreaking
his
vanity
on
me
that
made
him
smaller
in
my
eyes
and
my
first
awe
began
to
pass
never
cherish
rancour
you
know
he
said
my
business
it
is
silly
to
be
angry
for
it
wastes
energy
but
i
do
not
tolerate
insolence
my
dear
general
and
my
country
has
the
habit
of
doing
justice
on
her
enemies
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
the
end
is
not
far
off
germany
has
faced
a
jealous
world
in
arms
and
she
is
about
to
be
justified
of
her
great
courage
she
has
broken
up
bit
by
bit
the
clumsy
organization
of
her
opponents
where
is
russia
today
the
that
was
to
crush
us
where
is
the
poor
dupe
rumania
where
is
the
strength
of
italy
who
was
once
to
do
wonders
for
what
she
called
liberty
broken
all
of
them
i
have
played
my
part
in
that
work
and
now
the
need
is
past
my
country
with
free
hands
is
about
to
turn
upon
your
armed
rabble
in
the
west
and
drive
it
into
the
atlantic
then
we
shall
deal
with
the
ragged
remains
of
france
and
the
handful
of
noisy
americans
by
midsummer
there
will
be
peace
dictated
by
triumphant
germany
god
there
wo
i
had
found
my
voice
at
last
god
there
will
he
said
pleasantly
is
what
you
call
a
mathematical
certainty
you
will
no
doubt
die
bravely
like
the
savage
tribes
that
your
empire
used
to
conquer
but
we
have
the
greater
discipline
and
the
stronger
spirit
and
the
bigger
brain
stupidity
is
always
punished
in
the
end
and
you
are
a
stupid
race
do
not
think
that
your
kinsmen
across
the
atlantic
will
save
you
they
are
a
commercial
people
and
by
no
means
sure
of
themselves
when
they
have
blustered
a
little
they
will
see
reason
and
find
some
means
of
saving
their
faces
their
comic
president
will
make
a
speech
or
two
and
write
us
a
solemn
note
and
we
will
reply
with
the
serious
rhetoric
which
he
loves
and
then
we
shall
kiss
and
be
friends
you
know
in
your
heart
that
it
will
be
so
a
great
apathy
seemed
to
settle
on
me
this
bragging
did
not
make
me
angry
and
i
had
no
longer
any
wish
to
contradict
him
it
may
have
been
the
result
of
the
fall
but
my
mind
had
stopped
working
i
heard
his
voice
as
one
listens
casually
to
the
ticking
of
a
clock
will
tell
you
more
he
was
saying
is
the
evening
of
the
day
of
march
your
generals
in
france
expect
an
attack
but
they
are
not
sure
where
it
will
come
some
think
it
may
be
in
champagne
or
on
the
aisne
some
at
ypres
some
at
st
quentin
well
my
dear
general
you
alone
will
i
take
into
our
confidence
on
the
morning
of
the
three
days
from
now
we
attack
the
right
wing
of
the
british
army
in
two
days
we
shall
be
in
amiens
on
the
third
we
shall
have
driven
a
wedge
as
far
as
the
sea
then
in
a
week
or
so
we
shall
have
rolled
up
your
army
from
the
right
and
presently
we
shall
be
in
boulogne
and
calais
after
that
paris
falls
and
then
peace
i
made
no
answer
the
word
recalled
mary
and
i
was
trying
to
remember
the
day
in
january
when
she
and
i
had
motored
south
from
that
pleasant
city
do
i
tell
you
these
things
your
intelligence
for
you
are
not
altogether
foolish
will
have
supplied
the
answer
it
is
because
your
life
is
over
as
your
shakespeare
says
the
rest
is
silence
no
i
am
not
going
to
kill
you
that
would
be
crude
and
i
hate
crudities
i
am
going
now
on
a
little
journey
and
when
i
return
in
hours
time
you
will
be
my
companion
you
are
going
to
visit
germany
my
dear
general
that
woke
me
to
attention
and
he
noticed
it
for
he
went
on
with
gusto
have
heard
of
the
no
and
you
boast
of
an
intelligence
service
yet
your
ignorance
is
shared
by
the
whole
of
your
general
staff
it
is
a
little
organization
of
my
own
by
it
we
can
take
unwilling
and
dangerous
people
inside
our
frontier
to
be
dealt
with
as
we
please
some
have
gone
from
england
and
many
from
france
officially
i
believe
they
are
recorded
as
missing
but
they
did
not
go
astray
on
any
they
have
been
gathered
from
their
homes
or
from
hotels
or
offices
or
even
the
busy
streets
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
the
service
of
our
underground
railway
is
a
little
irregular
from
england
and
france
but
from
switzerland
it
is
smooth
as
a
trunk
line
there
are
unwatched
spots
on
the
frontier
and
we
have
our
agents
among
the
frontier
guards
and
we
have
no
difficulty
about
passes
it
is
a
pretty
device
and
you
will
soon
be
privileged
to
observe
its
working
in
germany
i
can
not
promise
you
comfort
but
i
do
not
think
your
life
will
be
dull
as
he
spoke
these
words
his
urbane
smile
changed
to
a
grin
of
impish
malevolence
even
through
my
torpor
i
felt
the
venom
and
i
shivered
i
return
i
shall
have
another
companion
his
voice
was
honeyed
again
is
a
certain
pretty
lady
who
was
to
be
the
bait
to
entice
me
into
italy
it
was
so
well
i
have
fallen
to
the
bait
i
have
arranged
that
she
shall
meet
me
this
very
night
at
a
mountain
inn
on
the
italian
side
i
have
arranged
too
that
she
shall
be
alone
she
is
an
innocent
child
and
i
do
not
think
that
she
has
been
more
than
a
tool
in
the
clumsy
hands
of
your
friends
she
will
come
with
me
when
i
ask
her
and
we
shall
be
a
merry
party
in
the
underground
express
my
apathy
vanished
and
every
nerve
in
me
was
alive
at
the
words
cur
i
cried
loathes
the
sight
of
you
she
would
touch
you
with
the
end
of
a
he
flicked
the
ash
from
his
cigar
think
you
are
mistaken
i
am
very
persuasive
and
i
do
not
like
to
use
compulsion
with
a
woman
but
willing
or
not
she
will
come
with
me
i
have
worked
hard
and
i
am
entitled
to
my
pleasure
and
i
have
set
my
heart
on
that
little
lady
there
was
something
in
his
tone
gross
leering
assured
half
contemptuous
that
made
my
blood
boil
he
had
fairly
got
me
on
the
raw
and
the
hammer
beat
violently
in
my
forehead
i
could
have
wept
with
sheer
rage
and
it
took
all
my
fortitude
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
but
i
was
determined
not
to
add
to
his
triumph
he
looked
at
his
watch
passes
he
said
must
depart
to
my
charming
assignation
i
will
give
your
remembrances
to
the
lady
forgive
me
for
making
no
arrangements
for
your
comfort
till
i
return
your
constitution
is
so
sound
that
it
will
not
suffer
from
a
fasting
to
set
your
mind
at
rest
i
may
tell
you
that
escape
is
impossible
this
mechanism
has
been
proved
too
often
and
if
you
did
break
loose
from
it
my
servants
would
deal
with
you
but
i
must
speak
a
word
of
caution
if
you
tamper
with
it
or
struggle
too
much
it
will
act
in
a
curious
way
the
floor
beneath
you
covers
a
shaft
which
runs
to
the
lake
below
set
a
certain
spring
at
work
and
you
may
find
yourself
shot
down
into
the
water
far
below
the
ice
where
your
body
will
rot
till
the
spring
that
of
course
is
an
alternative
open
to
you
if
you
do
not
care
to
wait
for
my
return
he
lit
a
fresh
cigar
waved
his
hand
and
vanished
through
the
doorway
as
it
shut
behind
him
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
instantly
died
away
the
walls
must
have
been
as
thick
as
a
prison
i
suppose
i
was
what
people
in
books
call
the
illumination
during
the
past
few
minutes
had
been
so
dazzling
that
my
brain
could
not
master
it
i
remember
very
clearly
that
i
did
not
think
about
the
ghastly
failure
of
our
scheme
or
the
german
plans
which
had
been
insolently
unfolded
to
me
as
to
one
dead
to
the
world
i
saw
a
single
picture
an
inn
in
a
snowy
valley
i
saw
it
as
a
small
place
like
peter
cottage
a
solitary
girl
that
smiling
devil
who
had
left
me
and
then
the
unknown
terror
of
the
underground
railway
i
think
my
courage
went
for
a
bit
and
i
cried
with
feebleness
and
rage
the
hammer
in
my
forehead
had
stopped
for
it
only
beat
when
i
was
angry
in
action
now
that
i
lay
trapped
the
manhood
had
slipped
out
of
my
joints
and
if
ivery
had
still
been
in
the
doorway
i
think
i
would
have
whined
for
mercy
i
would
have
offered
him
all
the
knowledge
i
had
in
the
world
if
he
had
promised
to
leave
mary
alone
happily
he
was
there
and
there
was
no
witness
of
my
cowardice
happily
too
it
is
just
as
difficult
to
be
a
coward
for
long
as
to
be
a
hero
it
was
blenkiron
phrase
about
mary
that
pulled
me
together
ca
scare
and
she
ca
soil
no
by
heavens
she
could
i
could
trust
my
lady
far
better
than
i
could
trust
myself
i
was
still
sick
with
anxiety
but
i
was
getting
a
pull
on
myself
i
was
done
in
but
ivery
would
get
no
triumph
out
of
me
either
i
would
go
under
the
ice
or
i
would
find
a
chance
of
putting
a
bullet
through
my
head
before
i
crossed
the
frontier
if
i
could
do
nothing
else
i
could
perish
decently
and
then
i
laughed
and
i
knew
i
was
past
the
worst
what
made
me
laugh
was
the
thought
of
peter
i
had
been
pitying
him
an
hour
ago
for
having
only
one
leg
but
now
he
was
abroad
in
the
living
breathing
world
with
years
before
him
and
i
lay
in
the
depths
limbless
and
lifeless
with
my
number
up
i
began
to
muse
on
the
cold
water
under
the
ice
where
i
could
go
if
i
wanted
i
did
not
think
that
i
would
take
that
road
for
a
chances
are
not
gone
till
he
is
stone
dead
but
i
was
glad
the
way
existed
and
then
i
looked
at
the
wall
in
front
of
me
and
very
far
up
i
saw
a
small
square
window
the
stars
had
been
clouded
when
i
entered
that
accursed
house
but
the
mist
must
have
cleared
i
saw
my
old
friend
orion
the
hunter
star
looking
through
the
bars
and
that
suddenly
made
me
think
peter
and
i
had
watched
them
by
night
and
i
knew
the
place
of
all
the
chief
constellations
in
relation
to
the
st
anton
valley
i
believed
that
i
was
in
a
room
on
the
lake
side
of
the
pink
chalet
i
must
be
if
ivery
had
spoken
the
truth
but
if
so
i
could
not
conceivably
see
orion
from
its
window
there
was
no
other
possible
conclusion
i
must
be
in
a
room
on
the
east
side
of
the
house
and
ivery
had
been
lying
he
had
already
lied
in
his
boasting
of
how
he
had
outwitted
me
in
england
and
at
the
front
he
might
be
lying
about
mary
no
i
dismissed
that
hope
those
words
of
his
had
rung
true
enough
i
thought
for
a
minute
and
concluded
that
he
had
lied
to
terrorize
me
and
keep
me
quiet
therefore
this
infernal
contraption
had
probably
its
weak
point
i
reflected
too
that
i
was
pretty
strong
far
stronger
probably
than
ivery
imagined
for
he
had
never
seen
me
stripped
since
the
place
was
pitch
dark
i
could
not
guess
how
the
thing
worked
but
i
could
feel
the
rigid
on
my
chest
and
legs
and
the
which
pinned
my
arms
to
my
sides
i
drew
a
long
breath
and
tried
to
force
my
elbows
apart
nothing
moved
nor
could
i
raise
the
bars
on
my
legs
the
smallest
fraction
again
i
tried
and
again
the
on
my
right
seemed
to
be
less
rigid
than
the
others
i
managed
to
get
my
right
hand
raised
above
the
level
of
my
thigh
and
then
with
a
struggle
i
got
a
grip
with
it
on
the
which
gave
me
a
small
leverage
with
a
mighty
effort
i
drove
my
right
elbow
and
shoulder
against
the
it
seemed
to
give
slightly
i
summoned
all
my
strength
and
tried
again
there
was
a
crack
and
then
a
splintering
the
massive
bar
shuffled
limply
back
and
my
right
arm
was
free
to
move
laterally
though
the
prevented
me
from
raising
it
with
some
difficulty
i
got
at
my
coat
pocket
where
reposed
my
electric
torch
and
my
pistol
with
immense
labour
and
no
little
pain
i
pulled
the
former
out
and
switched
it
on
by
drawing
the
catch
against
the
then
i
saw
my
prison
house
it
was
a
little
square
chamber
very
high
with
on
my
left
the
massive
door
by
which
ivery
had
departed
the
dark
baulks
of
my
rack
were
plain
and
i
could
roughly
make
out
how
the
thing
had
been
managed
some
spring
had
tilted
up
the
flooring
and
dropped
the
framework
from
its
place
in
the
wall
it
was
clamped
i
observed
by
an
arrangement
in
the
floor
just
in
front
of
the
door
if
i
could
get
rid
of
that
catch
it
would
be
easy
to
free
myself
for
to
a
man
of
my
strength
the
weight
would
not
be
impossibly
heavy
my
fortitude
had
come
back
to
me
and
i
was
living
only
in
the
moment
choking
down
any
hope
of
escape
my
first
job
was
to
destroy
the
catch
that
clamped
down
the
rack
and
for
that
my
only
weapon
was
my
pistol
i
managed
to
get
the
little
electric
torch
jammed
in
the
corner
of
the
where
it
lit
up
the
floor
towards
the
door
then
it
was
hell
own
business
extricating
the
pistol
from
my
pocket
wrist
and
fingers
were
always
cramping
and
i
was
in
terror
that
i
might
drop
it
where
i
could
not
retrieve
it
i
forced
myself
to
think
out
calmly
the
question
of
the
clamp
for
a
pistol
bullet
is
a
small
thing
and
i
could
not
afford
to
miss
i
reasoned
it
out
from
my
knowledge
of
mechanics
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
centre
of
gravity
was
a
certain
bright
spot
of
metal
which
i
could
just
see
under
the
it
was
bright
and
so
must
have
been
recently
repaired
and
that
was
another
reason
for
thinking
it
important
the
question
was
how
to
hit
it
for
i
could
not
get
the
pistol
in
line
with
my
eye
let
anyone
try
that
kind
of
shooting
with
a
bent
arm
over
a
bar
when
you
are
lying
flat
and
looking
at
the
mark
from
under
the
bar
and
he
will
understand
its
difficulties
i
had
six
shots
in
my
revolver
and
i
must
fire
two
or
three
ranging
shots
in
any
case
i
must
not
exhaust
all
my
cartridges
for
i
must
have
a
bullet
left
for
any
servant
who
came
to
pry
and
i
wanted
one
in
reserve
for
myself
but
i
did
not
think
shots
would
be
heard
outside
the
room
the
walls
were
too
thick
i
held
my
wrist
rigid
above
the
and
fired
the
bullet
was
an
inch
to
the
right
of
the
piece
of
bright
steel
moving
a
fraction
i
fired
again
i
had
grazed
it
on
the
left
with
aching
eyes
glued
on
the
mark
i
tried
a
third
time
i
saw
something
leap
apart
and
suddenly
the
whole
framework
under
which
i
lay
fell
loose
and
mobile
i
was
very
cool
and
restored
the
pistol
to
my
pocket
and
took
the
torch
in
my
hand
before
i
moved
fortune
had
been
kind
for
i
was
free
i
turned
on
my
face
humped
my
back
and
without
much
trouble
crawled
out
from
under
the
contraption
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
think
of
ultimate
escape
for
that
would
only
flurry
me
and
one
step
at
a
time
was
enough
i
remember
that
i
dusted
my
clothes
and
found
that
the
cut
in
the
back
of
my
head
had
stopped
bleeding
i
retrieved
my
hat
which
had
rolled
into
a
corner
when
i
fell
then
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
next
step
the
tunnel
was
impossible
and
the
only
way
was
the
door
if
i
had
stopped
to
think
i
would
have
known
that
the
chances
against
getting
out
of
such
a
house
were
a
thousand
to
one
the
pistol
shots
had
been
muffled
by
the
cavernous
walls
but
the
place
as
i
knew
was
full
of
servants
and
even
if
i
passed
the
immediate
door
i
would
be
collared
in
some
passage
but
i
had
myself
so
well
in
hand
that
i
tackled
the
door
as
if
i
had
been
prospecting
to
sink
a
new
shaft
in
rhodesia
it
had
no
handle
nor
so
far
as
i
could
see
a
keyhole
but
i
noticed
as
i
turned
my
torch
on
the
ground
that
from
the
clamp
which
i
had
shattered
a
brass
rod
sunk
in
the
floor
led
to
one
of
the
obviously
the
thing
worked
by
a
spring
and
was
connected
with
the
mechanism
of
the
rack
a
wild
thought
entered
my
mind
and
brought
me
to
my
feet
i
pushed
the
door
and
it
swung
slowly
open
the
bullet
which
freed
me
had
released
the
spring
which
controlled
it
then
for
the
first
time
against
all
my
maxims
of
discretion
i
began
to
hope
i
took
off
my
hat
and
felt
my
forehead
burning
so
that
i
rested
it
for
a
moment
on
the
cool
wall
perhaps
my
luck
still
held
with
a
rush
came
thoughts
of
mary
and
blenkiron
and
peter
and
everything
we
had
laboured
for
and
i
was
mad
to
win
i
had
no
notion
of
the
interior
of
the
house
or
where
lay
the
main
door
to
the
outer
world
my
torch
showed
me
a
long
passage
with
something
like
a
door
at
the
far
end
but
i
clicked
it
off
for
i
did
not
dare
to
use
it
now
the
place
was
deadly
quiet
as
i
listened
i
seemed
to
hear
a
door
open
far
away
and
then
silence
fell
again
i
groped
my
way
down
the
passage
till
i
had
my
hands
on
the
far
door
i
hoped
it
might
open
on
the
hall
where
i
could
escape
by
a
window
or
a
balcony
for
i
judged
the
outer
door
would
be
locked
i
listened
and
there
came
no
sound
from
within
it
was
no
use
lingering
so
very
stealthily
i
turned
the
handle
and
opened
it
a
crack
it
creaked
and
i
waited
with
beating
heart
on
discovery
for
inside
i
saw
the
glow
of
light
but
there
was
no
movement
so
it
must
be
empty
i
poked
my
head
in
and
then
followed
with
my
body
it
was
a
large
room
with
logs
burning
in
a
stove
and
the
floor
thick
with
rugs
it
was
lined
with
books
and
on
a
table
in
the
centre
a
was
burning
several
stood
on
the
table
and
there
was
a
little
pile
of
papers
a
man
had
been
here
a
minute
before
for
a
cigar
was
burning
on
the
edge
of
the
inkstand
at
that
moment
i
recovered
complete
use
of
my
wits
and
all
my
more
there
returned
to
me
some
of
the
old
which
before
had
served
me
well
ivery
had
gone
but
this
was
his
sanctum
just
as
on
the
roofs
of
erzerum
i
had
burned
to
get
at
stumm
papers
so
now
it
was
borne
in
on
me
that
at
all
costs
i
must
look
at
that
pile
i
advanced
to
the
table
and
picked
up
the
topmost
paper
it
was
a
little
typewritten
blue
slip
with
the
lettering
in
italics
and
in
a
corner
a
curious
involved
stamp
in
red
ink
on
it
i
read
wildvoegel
muessen
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
steps
and
the
door
opened
on
the
far
side
i
stepped
back
towards
the
stove
and
fingered
the
pistol
in
my
pocket
a
man
entered
a
man
with
a
scholar
stoop
an
unkempt
beard
and
large
sleepy
dark
eyes
at
the
sight
of
me
he
pulled
up
and
his
whole
body
grew
taut
it
was
the
portuguese
jew
whose
back
i
had
last
seen
at
the
smithy
door
in
skye
and
who
by
the
mercy
of
god
had
never
seen
my
face
i
stopped
fingering
my
pistol
for
i
had
an
inspiration
before
he
could
utter
a
word
i
got
in
first
voegelein
schweigen
im
walde
i
said
his
face
broke
into
a
pleasant
smile
and
he
replied
nur
balde
rubest
du
he
said
in
german
holding
out
his
hand
have
come
this
way
when
we
thought
you
would
go
by
modane
i
welcome
you
for
i
know
your
exploits
you
are
conradi
who
did
so
nobly
in
italy
i
bowed
i
am
conradi
i
said
chapter
seventeen
the
col
of
the
swallows
he
pointed
to
the
slip
on
the
table
have
seen
the
orders
i
nodded
long
day
work
is
over
you
must
rejoice
for
your
part
has
been
the
hardest
i
think
some
day
you
will
tell
me
about
it
the
man
face
was
honest
and
kindly
rather
like
that
of
the
engineer
gaudian
whom
two
years
before
i
had
met
in
germany
but
his
eyes
fascinated
me
for
they
were
the
eyes
of
the
dreamer
and
fanatic
who
would
not
desist
from
his
quest
while
life
lasted
i
thought
that
ivery
had
chosen
well
in
his
colleague
task
is
not
done
yet
i
said
came
here
to
see
chelius

late
i
must
see
him
at
once
he
has
gone
to
italy
and
i
must
overtake
him
know
your
duty
best
he
said
gravely
you
must
help
me
i
must
catch
him
at
santa
chiara
for
it
is
a
business
of
life
and
death
is
there
a
car
to
be
had
is
mine
but
there
is
no
chauffeur
chelius
took
him
can
drive
myself
and
i
know
the
road
but
i
have
no
pass
to
cross
the
frontier
is
easily
supplied
he
said
smiling
in
one
bookcase
there
was
a
shelf
of
dummy
books
he
unlocked
this
and
revealed
a
small
cupboard
whence
he
took
a
tin
from
some
papers
he
selected
one
which
seemed
to
be
already
signed
he
asked
me
hans
gruber
of
brieg
i
said
travel
to
pick
up
my
master
who
is
in
the
timber
trade
your
return
will
come
back
by
my
old
road
i
said
mysteriously
and
if
he
knew
what
i
meant
it
was
more
than
i
did
myself
he
completed
the
paper
and
handed
it
to
me
will
take
you
through
the
frontier
posts
and
now
for
the
car
the
servants
will
be
in
bed
for
they
have
been
preparing
for
a
long
journey
but
i
will
myself
show
it
you
there
is
enough
petrol
on
board
to
take
you
to
rome
he
led
me
through
the
hall
unlocked
the
front
door
and
we
crossed
the
snowy
lawn
to
the
garage
the
place
was
empty
but
for
a
great
car
which
bore
the
marks
of
having
come
from
the
muddy
lowlands
to
my
joy
i
saw
that
it
was
a
daimler
a
type
with
which
i
was
familiar
i
lit
the
lamps
started
the
engine
and
ran
it
out
on
to
the
road
will
want
an
overcoat
he
said
never
wear
them
have
some
chocolate
i
will
breakfast
at
santa
chiara
god
go
with
you
a
minute
later
i
was
tearing
along
the
towards
st
anton
village
i
stopped
at
the
cottage
on
the
hill
peter
was
not
yet
in
bed
i
found
him
sitting
by
the
fire
trying
to
read
but
i
saw
by
his
face
that
he
had
been
waiting
anxiously
on
my
coming
in
the
soup
old
man
i
said
as
i
shut
the
door
in
a
dozen
sentences
i
told
him
of
the
night
doings
of
ivery
plan
and
my
desperate
errand
wanted
a
share
i
cried
everything
depends
on
you
now
i
off
after
ivery
and
god
knows
what
will
happen
meantime
you
have
got
to
get
on
to
blenkiron
and
tell
him
what
i
told
you
he
must
get
the
news
through
to
somehow
he
must
trap
the
wild
birds
before
they
go
i
do
know
how
but
he
must
tell
him
it
all
up
to
him
and
you
for
i
out
of
it
i
must
save
mary
and
if
god
willing
i
settle
with
ivery
but
the
big
job
is
for
blenkiron
and
you
somehow
he
has
made
a
bad
break
and
the
enemy
has
got
ahead
of
him
he
must
sweat
blood
to
make
up
my
god
peter
it
the
solemnest
moment
of
our
lives
i
do
see
any
light
but
we
must
miss
any
chances
i
leaving
it
all
to
you
i
spoke
like
a
man
in
a
fever
for
after
what
i
had
been
through
i
was
quite
sane
my
coolness
in
the
pink
chalet
had
given
place
to
a
crazy
restlessness
i
can
see
peter
yet
standing
in
the
ring
of
lamplight
supporting
himself
by
a
chair
back
wrinkling
his
brows
and
as
he
always
did
in
moments
of
excitement
scratching
gently
the
tip
of
his
left
ear
his
face
was
happy
fear
dick
he
said
will
all
come
right
sal
plan
and
then
still
possessed
with
a
demon
of
disquiet
i
was
on
the
road
again
heading
for
the
pass
that
led
to
italy
the
mist
had
gone
from
the
sky
and
the
stars
were
shining
brightly
the
moon
now
at
the
end
of
its
first
quarter
was
setting
in
a
gap
of
the
mountains
as
i
climbed
the
low
col
from
the
st
anton
valley
to
the
greater
staubthal
there
was
frost
and
the
hard
snow
crackled
under
my
wheels
but
there
was
also
that
feel
in
the
air
which
preludes
storm
i
wondered
if
i
should
run
into
snow
in
the
high
hills
the
whole
land
was
deep
in
peace
there
was
not
a
light
in
the
hamlets
i
passed
through
not
a
soul
on
the
highway
in
the
staubthal
i
joined
the
main
road
and
swung
to
the
left
up
the
narrowing
bed
of
the
valley
the
road
was
in
noble
condition
and
the
car
was
running
finely
as
i
mounted
through
forests
of
snowy
pines
to
a
land
where
the
mountains
crept
close
together
and
the
highway
coiled
round
the
angles
of
great
crags
or
skirted
perilously
some
profound
gorge
with
only
a
line
of
wooden
posts
to
defend
it
from
the
void
in
places
the
snow
stood
in
walls
on
either
side
where
the
road
was
kept
open
by
man
labour
in
other
parts
it
lay
thin
and
in
the
dim
light
one
might
have
fancied
that
one
was
running
through
open
meadowlands
slowly
my
head
was
getting
clearer
and
i
was
able
to
look
round
my
problem
i
banished
from
my
mind
the
situation
i
had
left
behind
me
blenkiron
must
cope
with
that
as
best
he
could
it
lay
with
him
to
deal
with
the
wild
birds
my
job
was
with
ivery
alone
sometime
in
the
early
morning
he
would
reach
santa
chiara
and
there
he
would
find
mary
beyond
that
my
imagination
could
forecast
nothing
she
would
be
alone
i
could
trust
his
cleverness
for
that
he
would
try
to
force
her
to
come
with
him
or
he
might
persuade
her
with
some
lying
story
well
please
god
i
should
come
in
for
the
tail
end
of
the
interview
and
at
the
thought
i
cursed
the
steep
gradients
i
was
climbing
and
longed
for
some
magic
to
lift
the
daimler
beyond
the
summit
and
set
it
racing
down
the
slope
towards
italy
i
think
it
was
about
three
when
i
saw
the
lights
of
the
frontier
post
the
air
seemed
milder
than
in
the
valleys
and
there
was
a
soft
scurry
of
snow
on
my
right
cheek
a
couple
of
sleepy
swiss
sentries
with
their
rifles
in
their
hands
stumbled
out
as
i
drew
up
they
took
my
pass
into
the
hut
and
gave
me
an
anxious
quarter
of
an
hour
while
they
examined
it
the
performance
was
repeated
fifty
yards
on
at
the
italian
post
where
to
my
alarm
the
sentries
were
inclined
to
conversation
i
played
the
part
of
the
sulky
servant
answering
in
monosyllables
and
pretending
to
immense
stupidity
are
only
just
in
time
friend
said
one
in
german
weather
grows
bad
and
soon
the
pass
will
close
ugh
it
is
as
cold
as
last
winter
on
the
tonale
you
remember
giuseppe
but
in
the
end
they
let
me
move
on
for
a
little
i
felt
my
way
gingerly
for
on
the
summit
the
road
had
many
twists
and
the
snow
was
confusing
to
the
eyes
presently
came
a
sharp
drop
and
i
let
the
daimler
go
it
grew
colder
and
i
shivered
a
little
the
snow
became
a
wet
white
fog
around
the
glowing
arc
of
the
headlights
and
always
the
road
fell
now
in
long
curves
now
in
steep
short
dips
till
i
was
aware
of
a
glen
opening
towards
the
south
from
long
living
in
the
wilds
i
have
a
kind
of
sense
for
landscape
without
the
testimony
of
the
eyes
and
i
knew
where
the
ravine
narrowed
or
widened
though
it
was
black
darkness
in
spite
of
my
restlessness
i
had
to
go
slowly
for
after
the
first
rush
downhill
i
realized
that
unless
i
was
careful
i
might
wreck
the
car
and
spoil
everything
the
surface
of
the
road
on
the
southern
slope
of
the
mountains
was
a
thousand
per
cent
worse
than
that
on
the
other
i
skidded
and
and
once
grazed
the
edge
of
the
gorge
it
was
far
more
maddening
than
the
climb
up
for
then
it
had
been
a
grind
with
the
daimler
doing
its
utmost
whereas
now
i
had
to
hold
her
back
because
of
my
own
lack
of
skill
i
reckon
that
time
crawling
down
from
the
summit
of
the
staub
as
some
of
the
weariest
hours
i
ever
spent
quite
suddenly
i
ran
out
of
the
ill
weather
into
a
different
climate
the
sky
was
clear
above
me
and
i
saw
that
dawn
was
very
near
the
first
pinewoods
were
beginning
and
at
last
came
a
straight
slope
where
i
could
let
the
car
out
i
began
to
recover
my
spirits
which
had
been
very
dashed
and
to
reckon
the
distance
i
had
still
to
travel
and
then
without
warning
a
new
world
sprang
up
around
me
out
of
the
blue
dusk
white
shapes
rose
like
ghosts
peaks
and
needles
and
domes
of
ice
their
bases
fading
mistily
into
shadow
but
the
tops
kindling
till
they
glowed
like
jewels
i
had
never
seen
such
a
sight
and
the
wonder
of
it
for
a
moment
drove
anxiety
from
my
heart
more
it
gave
me
an
earnest
of
victory
i
was
in
clear
air
once
more
and
surely
in
this
diamond
ether
the
foul
things
which
loved
the
dark
must
be
worsted
and
then
i
saw
a
mile
ahead
the
little
square
building
which
i
knew
to
be
the
inn
of
santa
chiara
it
was
here
that
misfortune
met
me
i
had
grown
careless
now
and
looked
rather
at
the
house
than
the
road
at
one
point
the
hillside
had
slipped
down
it
must
have
been
recent
for
the
road
was
well
kept
and
i
did
not
notice
the
landslide
till
i
was
on
it
i
slewed
to
the
right
took
too
wide
a
curve
and
before
i
knew
the
car
was
over
the
far
edge
i
slapped
on
the
brakes
but
to
avoid
turning
turtle
i
had
to
leave
the
road
altogether
i
slithered
down
a
steep
bank
into
a
meadow
where
for
my
sins
i
ran
into
a
fallen
tree
trunk
with
a
jar
that
shook
me
out
of
my
seat
and
nearly
broke
my
arm
before
i
examined
the
car
i
knew
what
had
happened
the
front
axle
was
bent
and
the
off
front
wheel
badly
buckled
i
had
not
time
to
curse
my
stupidity
i
clambered
back
to
the
road
and
set
off
running
down
it
at
my
best
speed
i
was
mortally
stiff
for
ivery
rack
was
not
good
for
the
joints
but
i
realized
it
only
as
a
drag
on
my
pace
not
as
an
affliction
in
itself
my
whole
mind
was
set
on
the
house
before
me
and
what
might
be
happening
there
there
was
a
man
at
the
door
of
the
inn
who
when
he
caught
sight
of
my
figure
began
to
move
to
meet
me
i
saw
that
it
was
launcelot
wake
and
the
sight
gave
me
hope
but
his
face
frightened
me
it
was
drawn
and
haggard
like
one
who
never
sleeps
and
his
eyes
were
hot
coals
he
cried
god
sake
what
does
it
mean
is
mary
i
gasped
and
i
remember
i
clutched
at
a
lapel
of
his
coat
he
pulled
me
to
the
low
stone
wall
by
the
roadside
do
know
he
said
hoarsely
got
your
orders
to
come
here
this
morning
we
were
at
chiavagno
where
blenkiron
told
us
to
wait
but
last
night
mary
disappeared
i
found
she
had
hired
a
carriage
and
come
on
ahead
i
followed
at
once
and
reached
here
an
hour
ago
to
find
her
gone
the
woman
who
keeps
the
place
is
away
and
there
are
only
two
old
servants
left
they
tell
me
that
mary
came
here
late
and
that
very
early
in
the
morning
a
closed
car
came
over
the
staub
with
a
man
in
it
they
say
he
asked
to
see
the
young
lady
and
that
they
talked
together
for
some
time
and
that
then
she
went
off
with
him
in
the
car
down
the
valley
i
must
have
passed
it
on
my
way
up
there
been
some
black
devilment
that
i
ca
follow
who
was
the
man
who
was
the
man
he
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
throttle
me
can
tell
you
that
i
said
was
ivery
he
stared
for
a
second
as
if
he
did
understand
then
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
cursed
like
a
trooper
botched
it
as
i
knew
you
would
i
knew
no
good
would
come
of
your
infernal
subtleties
and
he
consigned
me
and
blenkiron
and
the
british
army
and
ivery
and
everybody
else
to
the
devil
i
was
past
being
angry
down
man
i
said
listen
to
me
i
told
him
of
what
had
happened
at
the
pink
chalet
he
heard
me
out
with
his
head
in
his
hands
the
thing
was
too
bad
for
cursing
underground
railway
he
groaned
thought
of
it
drives
me
mad
why
are
you
so
calm
hannay
she
in
the
hands
of
the
cleverest
devil
in
the
world
and
you
take
it
quietly
you
should
be
a
raving
lunatic
would
be
if
it
were
any
use
but
i
did
all
my
raving
last
night
in
that
den
of
ivery
we
got
to
pull
ourselves
together
wake
first
of
all
i
trust
mary
to
the
other
side
of
eternity
she
went
with
him
of
her
own
free
will
i
do
know
why
but
she
must
have
had
a
reason
and
be
sure
it
was
a
good
one
for
she
far
cleverer
than
you
or
me
we
got
to
follow
her
somehow
ivery
bound
for
germany
but
his
route
is
by
the
pink
chalet
for
he
hopes
to
pick
me
up
there
he
went
down
the
valley
therefore
he
is
going
to
switzerland
by
the
marjolana
that
is
a
long
circuit
and
will
take
him
most
of
the
day
why
he
chose
that
way
i
do
know
but
there
it
is
we
got
to
get
back
by
the
staub
did
you
come
he
asked
our
damnable
luck
i
came
in
a
daimler
which
is
now
lying
a
wreck
in
a
meadow
a
mile
up
the
road
we
got
to
foot
it
ca
do
it
it
would
take
too
long
besides
there
the
frontier
to
pass
i
remembered
ruefully
that
i
might
have
got
a
return
passport
from
the
portuguese
jew
if
i
had
thought
of
anything
at
the
time
beyond
getting
to
santa
chiara
we
must
make
a
circuit
by
the
hillside
and
dodge
the
guards
no
use
making
difficulties
wake
we
fairly
up
against
it
but
got
to
go
on
trying
till
we
drop
otherwise
i
take
your
advice
and
go
mad
supposing
you
get
back
to
st
anton
you
find
the
house
shut
up
and
the
travellers
gone
hours
before
by
the
underground
railway
likely
but
man
there
always
the
glimmering
of
a
chance
no
good
chucking
in
your
hand
till
the
game
out
your
proverbial
philosophy
mr
martin
tupper
and
look
up
there
he
had
one
foot
on
the
wall
and
was
staring
at
a
cleft
in
the
across
the
valley
the
shoulder
of
a
high
peak
dropped
sharply
to
a
kind
of
nick
and
rose
again
in
a
long
graceful
curve
of
snow
all
below
the
nick
was
still
in
deep
shadow
but
from
the
configuration
of
the
slopes
i
judged
that
a
tributary
glacier
ran
from
it
to
the
main
glacier
at
the
river
head
the
colle
delle
rondini
he
said
col
of
the
swallows
it
leads
straight
to
the
staubthal
near
grunewald
on
a
good
day
i
have
done
it
in
seven
hours
but
it
not
a
pass
for
it
has
been
done
of
course
but
not
often
yet
if
the
weather
held
it
might
go
even
now
and
that
would
bring
us
to
st
anton
by
the
evening
i
wonder
and
he
looked
me
over
with
an
appraising
eye
wonder
if
you
up
to
it
my
stiffness
had
gone
and
i
burned
to
set
my
restlessness
to
physical
toil
you
can
do
it
i
can
i
said
there
you
wrong
you
a
hefty
fellow
but
you
no
mountaineer
and
the
ice
of
the
colle
delle
rondini
needs
knowledge
it
would
be
insane
to
risk
it
with
a
novice
if
there
were
any
other
way
but
i
damned
if
i
see
any
and
i
going
to
chance
it
we
can
get
a
rope
and
axes
in
the
inn
are
you
game
you
are
seven
hours
you
say
we
got
to
do
it
in
six
will
be
humbler
when
you
get
on
the
ice
he
said
grimly
better
breakfast
for
the
lord
knows
when
we
shall
see
food
again
we
left
the
inn
at
five
minutes
to
nine
with
the
sky
cloudless
and
a
stiff
wind
from
the
which
we
felt
even
in
the
valley
wake
walked
with
a
long
slow
stride
that
tried
my
patience
i
wanted
to
hustle
but
he
bade
me
keep
in
step
take
your
orders
from
me
for
i
been
at
this
job
before
discipline
in
the
ranks
remember
we
crossed
the
river
gorge
by
a
plank
bridge
and
worked
our
way
up
the
right
bank
past
the
moraine
to
the
snout
of
the
glacier
it
was
bad
going
for
the
snow
concealed
the
boulders
and
i
often
floundered
in
holes
wake
never
relaxed
his
stride
but
now
and
then
he
stopped
to
sniff
the
air
i
observed
that
the
weather
looked
good
and
he
differed
too
clear
there
be
a
gale
on
the
col
and
most
likely
snow
in
the
afternoon
he
pointed
to
a
fat
yellow
cloud
that
was
beginning
to
bulge
over
the
nearest
peak
after
that
i
thought
he
lengthened
his
stride
i
had
these
boots
resoled
and
nailed
at
chiavagno
was
the
only
other
remark
he
made
till
we
had
passed
the
seracs
of
the
main
glacier
and
turned
up
the
lesser
from
the
colle
delle
rondini
by
ten
we
were
near
its
head
and
i
could
see
clearly
the
ribbon
of
pure
ice
between
black
crags
too
steep
for
snow
to
lie
on
which
was
the
means
of
ascent
to
the
col
the
sky
had
clouded
over
and
ugly
streamers
floated
on
the
high
slopes
we
tied
on
the
rope
at
the
foot
of
the
bergschrund
which
was
easy
to
pass
because
of
the
snow
wake
led
of
course
and
presently
we
came
on
to
the
icefall
in
my
time
i
had
done
a
lot
of
scrambling
on
rocks
and
used
to
promise
myself
a
season
in
the
alps
to
test
myself
on
the
big
peaks
if
i
ever
go
it
will
be
to
climb
the
honest
rock
towers
around
chamonix
for
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
snow
mountains
that
day
on
the
colle
delle
rondini
fairly
sickened
me
of
ice
i
daresay
i
might
have
liked
it
if
i
had
done
it
in
a
holiday
mood
at
leisure
and
in
good
spirits
but
to
crawl
up
that
couloir
with
a
sick
heart
and
a
desperate
impulse
to
hurry
was
the
worst
sort
of
nightmare
the
place
was
as
steep
as
a
wall
of
smooth
black
ice
that
seemed
hard
as
granite
wake
did
the
and
i
admired
him
enormously
he
did
not
seem
to
use
much
force
but
every
step
was
hewn
cleanly
the
right
size
and
they
were
spaced
the
right
distance
in
this
job
he
was
the
true
professional
i
was
thankful
blenkiron
was
not
with
us
for
the
thing
would
have
given
a
squirrel
vertigo
the
chips
of
ice
slithered
between
my
legs
and
i
could
watch
them
till
they
brought
up
just
above
the
bergschrund
the
ice
was
in
shadow
and
it
was
bitterly
cold
as
we
crawled
up
i
had
not
the
exercise
of
using
the
axe
to
warm
me
and
i
got
very
numb
standing
on
one
leg
waiting
for
the
next
step
worse
still
my
legs
began
to
cramp
i
was
in
good
condition
but
that
time
under
rack
had
played
the
mischief
with
my
limbs
muscles
got
out
of
place
in
my
calves
and
stood
in
aching
lumps
till
i
almost
squealed
with
the
pain
of
it
i
was
mortally
afraid
i
should
slip
and
every
time
i
moved
i
called
out
to
wake
to
warn
him
he
saw
what
was
happening
and
got
the
pick
of
his
axe
fixed
in
the
ice
before
i
was
allowed
to
stir
he
spoke
often
to
cheer
me
up
and
his
voice
had
none
of
its
harshness
he
was
like
some
generals
i
have
known
very
gentle
in
a
battle
at
the
end
the
snow
began
to
fall
a
soft
powder
like
the
overspill
of
a
storm
raging
beyond
the
crest
it
was
just
after
that
that
wake
cried
out
that
in
five
minutes
we
would
be
at
the
summit
he
consulted
his
good
time
too
only
minutes
behind
my
best
it
not
one
the
next
i
knew
i
was
lying
flat
on
a
pad
of
snow
easing
my
cramped
legs
while
wake
shouted
in
my
ear
that
we
were
in
for
something
bad
i
was
aware
of
a
driving
blizzard
but
i
had
no
thought
of
anything
but
the
blessed
relief
from
pain
i
lay
for
some
minutes
on
my
back
with
my
legs
stiff
in
the
air
and
the
toes
turned
inwards
while
my
muscles
fell
into
their
proper
place
it
was
certainly
no
spot
to
linger
in
we
looked
down
into
a
trough
of
driving
mist
which
sometimes
swirled
aside
and
showed
a
knuckle
of
black
rock
far
below
we
ate
some
chocolate
while
wake
shouted
in
my
ear
that
now
we
had
less
he
did
his
best
to
cheer
me
but
he
could
not
hide
his
anxiety
our
faces
were
frosted
over
like
a
and
the
sting
of
the
wind
was
like
a
whiplash
on
our
eyelids
the
first
part
was
easy
down
a
slope
of
firm
snow
where
steps
were
not
needed
then
came
ice
again
and
we
had
to
cut
into
it
below
the
fresh
surface
snow
this
was
so
laborious
that
wake
took
to
the
rocks
on
the
right
side
of
the
couloir
where
there
was
some
shelter
from
the
main
force
of
the
blast
i
found
it
easier
for
i
knew
something
about
rocks
but
it
was
difficult
enough
with
every
handhold
and
foothold
glazed
presently
we
were
driven
back
again
to
the
ice
and
painfully
cut
our
way
through
a
throat
of
the
ravine
where
the
sides
narrowed
there
the
wind
was
terrible
for
the
narrows
made
a
kind
of
funnel
and
we
descended
plastered
against
the
wall
and
scarcely
able
to
breathe
while
the
tornado
plucked
at
our
bodies
as
if
it
would
whisk
us
like
wisps
of
grass
into
the
abyss
after
that
the
gorge
widened
and
we
had
an
easier
slope
till
suddenly
we
found
ourselves
perched
on
a
great
tongue
of
rock
round
which
the
snow
blew
like
the
froth
in
a
whirlpool
as
we
stopped
for
breath
wake
shouted
in
my
ear
that
this
was
the
black
stone
what
i
yelled
schwarzstein
the
swiss
call
the
pass
the
schwarzsteinthor
you
can
see
it
from
grunewald
i
suppose
every
man
has
a
tinge
of
superstition
in
him
to
hear
that
name
in
that
ferocious
place
gave
me
a
sudden
access
of
confidence
i
seemed
to
see
all
my
doings
as
part
of
a
great
predestined
plan
surely
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
the
word
which
had
been
the
key
of
my
first
adventure
in
the
long
tussle
should
appear
in
this
last
phase
i
felt
new
strength
in
my
legs
and
more
vigour
in
my
lungs
good
omen
i
shouted
old
man
we
going
to
win
out
worst
is
still
to
come
he
said
he
was
right
to
get
down
that
tongue
of
rock
to
the
lower
snows
of
the
couloir
was
a
job
that
fairly
brought
us
to
the
end
of
our
tether
i
can
feel
yet
the
sour
bleak
smell
of
wet
rock
and
ice
and
the
hard
nerve
pain
that
racked
my
forehead
the
kaffirs
used
to
say
that
there
were
devils
in
the
high
berg
and
this
place
was
assuredly
given
over
to
the
powers
of
the
air
who
had
no
thought
of
human
life
i
seemed
to
be
in
the
world
which
had
endured
from
the
eternity
before
man
was
dreamed
of
there
was
no
mercy
in
it
and
the
elements
were
pitting
their
immortal
strength
against
two
pigmies
who
had
profaned
their
sanctuary
i
yearned
for
warmth
for
the
glow
of
a
fire
for
a
tree
or
blade
of
grass
or
anything
which
meant
the
sheltered
homeliness
of
mortality
i
knew
then
what
the
greeks
meant
by
panic
for
i
was
scared
by
the
apathy
of
nature
but
the
terror
gave
me
a
kind
of
comfort
too
ivery
and
his
doings
seemed
less
formidable
let
me
but
get
out
of
this
cold
hell
and
i
could
meet
him
with
a
new
confidence
wake
led
for
he
knew
the
road
and
the
road
wanted
knowing
otherwise
he
should
have
been
last
on
the
rope
for
that
is
the
place
of
the
better
man
in
a
descent
i
had
some
horrible
moments
following
on
when
the
rope
grew
taut
for
i
had
no
help
from
it
we
zigzagged
down
the
rock
sometimes
driven
to
the
ice
of
the
adjacent
couloirs
sometimes
on
the
outer
ridge
of
the
black
stone
sometimes
wriggling
down
little
cracks
and
over
evil
the
snow
did
not
lie
on
it
but
the
rock
crackled
with
thin
ice
or
oozed
ice
water
often
it
was
only
by
the
grace
of
god
that
i
did
not
fall
headlong
and
pull
wake
out
of
his
hold
to
the
bergschrund
far
below
i
slipped
more
than
once
but
always
by
a
miracle
recovered
myself
to
make
things
worse
wake
was
tiring
i
could
feel
him
drag
on
the
rope
and
his
movements
had
not
the
precision
they
had
had
in
the
morning
he
was
the
mountaineer
and
i
the
novice
if
he
gave
out
we
should
never
reach
the
valley
the
fellow
was
clear
grit
all
through
when
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
tooth
and
sat
huddled
up
with
our
faces
away
from
the
wind
i
saw
that
he
was
on
the
edge
of
fainting
what
that
effort
must
have
cost
him
in
the
way
of
resolution
you
may
guess
but
he
did
not
fail
till
the
worst
was
past
his
lips
were
colourless
and
he
was
choking
with
the
nausea
of
fatigue
i
found
a
flask
of
brandy
in
his
pocket
and
a
mouthful
revived
him
all
out
he
said
road
easier
now
and
i
can
direct
you
about
the
rest
you
better
leave
me
i
only
be
a
drag
come
on
when
i
feel
better
you
do
you
old
fool
you
got
me
over
that
infernal
iceberg
and
i
going
to
see
you
home
i
rubbed
his
arms
and
legs
and
made
him
swallow
some
chocolate
but
when
he
got
on
his
feet
he
was
as
doddery
as
an
old
man
happily
we
had
an
easy
course
down
a
snow
gradient
which
we
glissaded
in
very
unorthodox
style
the
swift
motion
freshened
him
up
a
little
and
he
was
able
to
put
on
the
brake
with
his
axe
to
prevent
us
cascading
into
the
bergschrund
we
crossed
it
by
a
snow
bridge
and
started
out
on
the
seracs
of
the
schwarzstein
glacier
i
am
no
mountaineer
not
of
the
snow
and
ice
kind
anyway
but
i
have
a
big
share
of
physical
strength
and
i
wanted
it
all
now
for
those
seracs
were
an
invention
of
the
devil
to
traverse
that
labyrinth
in
a
blinding
snowstorm
with
a
fainting
companion
who
was
too
weak
to
jump
the
narrowest
crevasse
and
who
hung
on
the
rope
like
lead
when
there
was
occasion
to
use
it
was
more
than
i
could
manage
besides
every
step
that
brought
us
nearer
to
the
valley
now
increased
my
eagerness
to
hurry
and
wandering
in
that
maze
of
clotted
ice
was
like
the
nightmare
when
you
stand
on
the
rails
with
the
express
coming
and
are
too
weak
to
climb
on
the
platform
as
soon
as
possible
i
left
the
glacier
for
the
hillside
and
though
that
was
laborious
enough
in
all
conscience
yet
it
enabled
me
to
steer
a
straight
course
wake
never
spoke
a
word
when
i
looked
at
him
his
face
was
ashen
under
a
gale
which
should
have
made
his
cheeks
glow
and
he
kept
his
eyes
half
closed
he
was
staggering
on
at
the
very
limits
of
his
endurance
by
and
by
we
were
on
the
moraine
and
after
splashing
through
a
dozen
little
glacier
streams
came
on
a
track
which
led
up
the
hillside
wake
nodded
feebly
when
i
asked
if
this
was
right
then
to
my
joy
i
saw
a
gnarled
pine
i
untied
the
rope
and
wake
dropped
like
a
log
on
the
ground
me
he
groaned
fairly
done
i
come
on
later
and
he
shut
his
eyes
my
watch
told
me
that
it
was
after
five
on
my
back
i
said
wo
part
from
you
till
i
found
a
cottage
you
a
hero
you
brought
me
over
those
damned
mountains
in
a
blizzard
and
that
what
no
other
man
in
england
would
have
done
get
up
he
obeyed
for
he
was
too
far
gone
to
argue
i
tied
his
wrists
together
with
a
handkerchief
below
my
chin
for
i
wanted
my
arms
to
hold
up
his
legs
the
rope
and
axes
i
left
in
a
cache
beneath
the
then
i
started
trotting
down
the
track
for
the
nearest
dwelling
my
strength
felt
inexhaustible
and
the
quicksilver
in
my
bones
drove
me
forward
the
snow
was
still
falling
but
the
wind
was
dying
down
and
after
the
inferno
of
the
pass
it
was
like
summer
the
road
wound
over
the
shale
of
the
hillside
and
then
into
what
in
spring
must
have
been
upland
meadows
then
it
ran
among
trees
and
far
below
me
on
the
right
i
could
hear
the
glacier
river
churning
in
its
gorge
soon
little
empty
huts
appeared
and
rough
enclosed
paddocks
and
presently
i
came
out
on
a
shelf
above
the
stream
and
smelt
the
of
a
human
habitation
i
found
a
peasant
in
the
cottage
a
guide
by
profession
in
summer
and
a
woodcutter
in
winter
have
brought
my
herr
from
santa
chiara
i
said
the
schwarzsteinthor
he
is
very
weary
and
must
sleep
i
decanted
wake
into
a
chair
and
his
head
nodded
on
his
chest
but
his
colour
was
better
and
your
herr
are
fools
said
the
man
gruffly
but
not
unkindly
must
sleep
or
he
will
have
a
fever
the
schwarzsteinthor
in
this
devil
weather
is
he
english
i
said
all
madmen
but
he
a
good
herr
and
a
brave
mountaineer
we
stripped
wake
of
his
red
cross
uniform
now
a
collection
of
sopping
rags
and
got
him
between
blankets
with
a
huge
earthenware
bottle
of
hot
water
at
his
feet
the
woodcutter
wife
boiled
milk
and
this
with
a
little
brandy
added
we
made
him
drink
i
was
quite
easy
in
my
mind
about
him
for
i
had
seen
this
condition
before
in
the
morning
he
would
be
as
stiff
as
a
poker
but
recovered
i
off
for
st
anton
i
said
must
get
there
tonight
are
the
hardy
one
the
man
laughed
will
show
you
the
quick
road
to
grunewald
where
is
the
railway
with
good
fortune
you
may
get
the
last
train
i
gave
him
fifty
francs
on
my
herr
behalf
learned
his
directions
for
the
road
and
set
off
after
a
draught
of
goat
milk
munching
my
last
slab
of
chocolate
i
was
still
strung
up
to
a
mechanical
activity
and
i
ran
every
inch
of
the
three
miles
to
the
staubthal
without
consciousness
of
fatigue
i
was
twenty
minutes
too
soon
for
the
train
and
as
i
sat
on
a
bench
on
the
platform
my
energy
suddenly
ebbed
away
that
is
what
happens
after
a
great
exertion
i
longed
to
sleep
and
when
the
train
arrived
i
crawled
into
a
carriage
like
a
man
with
a
stroke
there
seemed
to
be
no
force
left
in
my
limbs
i
realized
that
i
was
which
is
a
thing
you
see
sometimes
with
horses
but
not
often
with
men
all
the
journey
i
lay
like
a
log
in
a
kind
of
coma
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
recognized
my
destination
and
stumbled
out
of
the
train
but
i
had
no
sooner
emerged
from
the
station
of
st
anton
than
i
got
my
second
wind
much
snow
had
fallen
since
yesterday
but
it
had
stopped
now
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
moon
was
riding
the
sight
of
the
familiar
place
brought
back
all
my
anxieties
the
day
on
the
col
of
the
swallows
was
wiped
out
of
my
memory
and
i
saw
only
the
inn
at
santa
chiara
and
heard
wake
hoarse
voice
speaking
of
mary
the
lights
were
twinkling
from
the
village
below
and
on
the
right
i
saw
the
clump
of
trees
which
held
the
pink
chalet
i
took
a
short
cut
across
the
fields
avoiding
the
little
town
i
ran
hard
stumbling
often
for
though
i
had
got
my
mental
energy
back
my
legs
were
still
precarious
the
station
clock
had
told
me
that
it
was
nearly
nine
soon
i
was
on
the
and
then
at
the
chalet
gates
i
heard
as
in
a
dream
what
seemed
to
be
three
shrill
blasts
on
a
whistle
then
a
big
car
passed
me
making
for
st
anton
for
a
second
i
would
have
hailed
it
but
it
was
past
me
and
away
but
i
had
a
conviction
that
my
business
lay
in
the
house
for
i
thought
ivery
was
there
and
ivery
was
what
mattered
i
marched
up
the
drive
with
no
sort
of
plan
in
my
head
only
a
blind
rushing
on
fate
i
remembered
dimly
that
i
had
still
three
cartridges
in
my
revolver
the
front
door
stood
open
and
i
entered
and
tiptoed
down
the
passage
to
the
room
where
i
had
found
the
portuguese
jew
no
one
hindered
me
but
it
was
not
for
lack
of
servants
i
had
the
impression
that
there
were
people
near
me
in
the
darkness
and
i
thought
i
heard
german
softly
spoken
there
was
someone
ahead
of
me
perhaps
the
speaker
for
i
could
hear
careful
footsteps
it
was
very
dark
but
a
ray
of
light
came
from
below
the
door
of
the
room
then
behind
me
i
heard
the
hall
door
clang
and
the
noise
of
a
key
turned
in
its
lock
i
had
walked
straight
into
a
trap
and
all
retreat
was
cut
off
my
mind
was
beginning
to
work
more
clearly
though
my
purpose
was
still
vague
i
wanted
to
get
at
ivery
and
i
believed
that
he
was
somewhere
in
front
of
me
and
then
i
thought
of
the
door
which
led
from
the
chamber
where
i
had
been
imprisoned
if
i
could
enter
that
way
i
would
have
the
advantage
of
surprise
i
groped
on
the
side
of
the
passage
and
found
a
handle
it
opened
upon
what
seemed
to
be
a
for
there
was
a
faint
smell
of
food
again
i
had
the
impression
of
people
near
who
for
some
unknown
reason
did
not
molest
me
at
the
far
end
i
found
another
door
which
led
to
a
second
room
which
i
guessed
to
be
adjacent
to
the
library
beyond
it
again
must
lie
the
passage
from
the
chamber
with
the
rack
the
whole
place
was
as
quiet
as
a
shell
i
had
guessed
right
i
was
standing
in
the
passage
where
i
had
stood
the
night
before
in
front
of
me
was
the
library
and
there
was
the
same
chink
of
light
showing
very
softly
i
turned
the
handle
and
opened
it
a
crack
the
first
thing
that
caught
my
eye
was
the
profile
of
ivery
he
was
looking
towards
the
where
someone
was
sitting
chapter
eighteen
the
underground
railway
this
is
the
story
which
i
heard
later
from
mary
she
was
at
milan
with
the
new
hospital
when
she
got
blenkiron
letter
santa
chiara
had
always
been
the
place
agreed
upon
and
this
message
mentioned
specifically
santa
chiara
and
fixed
a
date
for
her
presence
there
she
was
a
little
puzzled
by
it
for
she
had
not
yet
had
a
word
from
ivery
to
whom
she
had
written
twice
by
the
roundabout
address
in
france
which
bommaerts
had
given
her
she
did
not
believe
that
he
would
come
to
italy
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
and
she
wondered
at
blenkiron
certainty
about
the
date
the
following
morning
came
a
letter
from
ivery
in
which
he
ardently
pressed
for
a
meeting
it
was
the
first
of
several
full
of
strange
talk
about
some
approaching
crisis
in
which
the
forebodings
of
the
prophet
were
mingled
with
the
solicitude
of
a
lover
storm
is
about
to
break
he
wrote
i
can
not
think
only
of
my
own
fate
i
have
something
to
tell
you
which
vitally
concerns
yourself
you
say
you
are
in
lombardy
the
chiavagno
valley
is
within
easy
reach
and
at
its
head
is
the
inn
of
santa
chiara
to
which
i
come
on
the
morning
of
march
meet
me
there
even
if
only
for
half
an
hour
i
implore
you
we
have
already
shared
hopes
and
confidences
and
i
would
now
share
with
you
a
knowledge
which
i
alone
in
europe
possess
you
have
the
heart
of
a
lion
my
lady
worthy
of
what
i
can
bring
you
wake
was
summoned
from
the
unit
with
which
he
was
working
at
vicenza
and
the
plan
arranged
by
blenkiron
was
faithfully
carried
out
four
officers
of
the
alpini
in
the
rough
dress
of
peasants
of
the
hills
met
them
in
chiavagno
on
the
morning
of
the
it
was
arranged
that
the
hostess
of
santa
chiara
should
go
on
a
visit
to
her
sister
son
leaving
the
inn
now
in
the
shuttered
quiet
of
wintertime
under
the
charge
of
two
ancient
servants
the
hour
of
ivery
coming
on
the
had
been
fixed
by
him
for
noon
and
that
morning
mary
would
drive
up
the
valley
while
wake
and
the
alpini
went
inconspicuously
by
other
routes
so
as
to
be
in
station
around
the
place
before
midday
but
on
the
evening
of
the
at
the
hotel
of
the
four
kings
in
chiavagno
mary
received
another
message
it
was
from
me
and
told
her
that
i
was
crossing
the
staub
at
midnight
and
would
be
at
the
inn
before
dawn
it
begged
her
to
meet
me
there
to
meet
me
alone
without
the
others
because
i
had
that
to
say
to
her
which
must
be
said
before
ivery
coming
i
have
seen
the
letter
it
was
written
in
a
hand
which
i
could
not
have
distinguished
from
my
own
scrawl
it
was
not
exactly
what
i
would
myself
have
written
but
there
were
phrases
in
it
which
to
mary
mind
could
have
come
only
from
me
oh
i
admit
it
was
cunningly
done
especially
the
which
was
just
the
kind
of
stammering
thing
which
i
would
have
achieved
if
i
had
tried
to
put
my
feelings
on
paper
anyhow
mary
had
no
doubt
of
its
genuineness
she
slipped
off
after
dinner
hired
a
carriage
with
two
screws
and
set
off
up
the
valley
she
left
a
line
for
wake
telling
him
to
follow
according
to
the
plan
a
line
which
he
never
got
for
his
anxiety
when
he
found
she
had
gone
drove
him
to
immediate
pursuit
at
about
two
in
the
morning
of
the
after
a
slow
and
icy
journey
she
arrived
at
the
inn
knocked
up
the
aged
servants
made
herself
a
cup
of
chocolate
out
of
her
and
sat
down
to
wait
on
my
coming
she
has
described
to
me
that
time
of
waiting
a
candle
in
a
tall
earthenware
candlestick
lit
up
the
little
which
was
the
one
room
in
use
the
world
was
very
quiet
the
snow
muffled
the
roads
and
it
was
cold
with
the
penetrating
chill
of
the
small
hours
of
a
march
night
always
she
has
told
me
will
the
taste
of
chocolate
and
the
smell
of
burning
tallow
bring
back
to
her
that
strange
place
and
the
flutter
of
the
heart
with
which
she
waited
for
she
was
on
the
eve
of
the
crisis
of
all
our
labours
she
was
very
young
and
youth
has
a
quick
fancy
which
will
not
be
checked
moreover
it
was
i
who
was
coming
and
save
for
the
scrawl
of
the
night
before
we
had
had
no
communication
for
many
weeks
she
tried
to
distract
her
mind
by
repeating
poetry
and
the
thing
that
came
into
her
head
was
an
odd
poem
for
the
time
and
place
there
was
a
long
wicker
chair
among
the
furnishings
of
the
room
and
she
lay
down
on
it
with
her
fur
cloak
muffled
around
her
there
were
sounds
of
movement
in
the
inn
the
old
woman
who
had
let
her
in
with
the
scent
of
intrigue
of
her
kind
had
brightened
when
she
heard
that
another
guest
was
coming
beautiful
women
do
not
travel
at
midnight
for
nothing
she
also
was
awake
and
expectant
then
quite
suddenly
came
the
sound
of
a
car
slowing
down
outside
she
sprang
to
her
feet
in
a
tremor
of
excitement
it
was
like
the
picardy
chateau
again
the
dim
room
and
a
friend
coming
out
of
the
night
she
heard
the
front
door
open
and
a
step
in
the
little
hall
she
was
looking
at
ivery
he
slipped
his
off
as
he
entered
and
bowed
gravely
he
was
wearing
a
green
hunting
suit
which
in
the
dusk
seemed
like
khaki
and
as
he
was
about
my
own
height
for
a
second
she
was
misled
then
she
saw
his
face
and
her
heart
stopped
she
cried
she
had
sunk
back
again
on
the
wicker
chair
have
come
as
i
promised
he
said
a
little
earlier
you
will
forgive
me
my
eagerness
to
be
with
you
she
did
not
heed
his
words
for
her
mind
was
feverishly
busy
my
letter
had
been
a
fraud
and
this
man
had
discovered
our
plans
she
was
alone
with
him
for
it
would
be
hours
before
her
friends
came
from
chiavagno
he
had
the
game
in
his
hands
and
of
all
our
confederacy
she
alone
remained
to
confront
him
mary
courage
was
pretty
near
perfect
and
for
the
moment
she
did
not
think
of
herself
or
her
own
fate
that
came
later
she
was
possessed
with
poignant
disappointment
at
our
failure
all
our
efforts
had
gone
to
the
winds
and
the
enemy
had
won
with
contemptuous
ease
her
nervousness
disappeared
before
the
intense
regret
and
her
brain
set
coolly
and
busily
to
work
it
was
a
new
ivery
who
confronted
her
a
man
with
vigour
and
purpose
in
every
line
of
him
and
the
quiet
confidence
of
power
he
spoke
with
a
serious
courtesy
time
for
is
past
he
was
saying
have
fenced
with
each
other
i
have
told
you
only
half
the
truth
and
you
have
always
kept
me
at
arm
length
but
you
knew
in
your
heart
my
dearest
lady
that
there
must
be
the
full
truth
between
us
some
day
and
that
day
has
come
i
have
often
told
you
that
i
love
you
i
do
not
come
now
to
repeat
that
declaration
i
come
to
ask
you
to
entrust
yourself
to
me
to
join
your
fate
to
mine
for
i
can
promise
you
the
happiness
which
you
deserve
he
pulled
up
a
chair
and
sat
beside
her
i
can
not
put
down
all
that
he
said
for
mary
once
she
grasped
the
drift
of
it
was
busy
with
her
own
thoughts
and
did
not
listen
but
i
gather
from
her
that
he
was
very
candid
and
seemed
to
grow
as
he
spoke
in
mental
and
moral
stature
he
told
her
who
he
was
and
what
his
work
had
been
he
claimed
the
same
purpose
as
hers
a
hatred
of
war
and
a
passion
to
rebuild
the
world
into
decency
but
now
he
drew
a
different
moral
he
was
a
german
it
was
through
germany
alone
that
peace
and
regeneration
could
come
his
country
was
purged
from
her
faults
and
the
marvellous
german
discipline
was
about
to
prove
itself
in
the
eye
of
gods
and
men
he
told
her
what
he
had
told
me
in
the
room
at
the
pink
chalet
but
with
another
colouring
germany
was
not
vengeful
or
vainglorious
only
patient
and
merciful
god
was
about
to
give
her
the
power
to
decide
the
world
fate
and
it
was
for
him
and
his
kind
to
see
that
the
decision
was
beneficent
the
greater
task
of
his
people
was
only
now
beginning
that
was
the
gist
of
his
talk
she
appeared
to
listen
but
her
mind
was
far
away
she
must
delay
him
for
two
hours
three
hours
four
hours
if
not
she
must
keep
beside
him
she
was
the
only
one
of
our
company
left
in
touch
with
the
enemy
go
to
germany
now
he
was
saying
want
you
to
come
with
me
to
be
my
wife
he
waited
for
an
answer
and
got
it
in
the
form
of
a
startled
question
germany
how
is
easy
he
said
smiling
car
which
is
waiting
outside
is
the
first
stage
of
a
system
of
travel
which
we
have
perfected
then
he
told
her
about
the
underground
railway
not
as
he
had
told
it
to
me
to
scare
but
as
a
proof
of
power
and
forethought
his
manner
was
perfect
he
was
respectful
devoted
thoughtful
of
all
things
he
was
the
suppliant
not
the
master
he
offered
her
power
and
pride
a
dazzling
career
for
he
had
deserved
well
of
his
country
the
devotion
of
the
faithful
lover
he
would
take
her
to
his
house
where
she
would
be
welcomed
like
a
princess
i
have
no
doubt
he
was
sincere
for
he
had
many
moods
and
the
libertine
whom
he
had
revealed
to
me
at
the
pink
chalet
had
given
place
to
the
honourable
gentleman
he
could
play
all
parts
well
because
he
could
believe
in
himself
in
them
all
then
he
spoke
of
danger
not
so
as
to
slight
her
courage
but
to
emphasize
his
own
thoughtfulness
the
world
in
which
she
had
lived
was
crumbling
and
he
alone
could
offer
a
refuge
she
felt
the
steel
gauntlet
through
the
texture
of
the
velvet
glove
all
the
while
she
had
been
furiously
thinking
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
in
the
old
way
she
might
refuse
to
go
he
could
compel
her
no
doubt
for
there
was
no
help
to
be
got
from
the
old
servants
but
it
might
be
difficult
to
carry
an
unwilling
woman
over
the
first
stages
of
the
underground
railway
there
might
be
chances
supposing
he
accepted
her
refusal
and
left
her
then
indeed
he
would
be
gone
for
ever
and
our
game
would
have
closed
with
a
fiasco
the
great
antagonist
of
england
would
go
home
rejoicing
taking
his
sheaves
with
him
at
this
time
she
had
no
personal
fear
of
him
so
curious
a
thing
is
the
human
heart
that
her
main
preoccupation
was
with
our
mission
not
with
her
own
fate
to
fail
utterly
seemed
too
bitter
supposing
she
went
with
him
they
had
still
to
get
out
of
italy
and
cross
switzerland
if
she
were
with
him
she
would
be
an
emissary
of
the
allies
in
the
camp
she
asked
herself
what
could
she
do
and
told
herself
she
felt
like
a
small
bird
in
a
very
large
trap
and
her
chief
sensation
was
that
of
her
own
powerlessness
but
she
had
learned
blenkiron
gospel
and
knew
that
heaven
sends
amazing
chances
to
the
bold
and
even
as
she
made
her
decision
she
was
aware
of
a
dark
shadow
lurking
at
the
back
of
her
mind
the
shadow
of
the
fear
which
she
knew
was
awaiting
her
for
she
was
going
into
the
unknown
with
a
man
whom
she
hated
a
man
who
claimed
to
be
her
lover
it
was
the
bravest
thing
i
have
ever
heard
of
and
i
have
lived
my
life
among
brave
men
will
come
with
you
she
said
you
must
speak
to
me
please
i
am
tired
and
troubled
and
i
want
peace
to
think
as
she
rose
weakness
came
over
her
and
she
swayed
till
his
arm
caught
her
wish
i
could
let
you
rest
for
a
little
he
said
tenderly
time
presses
the
car
runs
smoothly
and
you
can
sleep
there
he
summoned
one
of
the
servants
to
whom
he
handed
mary
leave
in
ten
minutes
he
said
and
he
went
out
to
see
to
the
car
mary
first
act
in
the
bedroom
to
which
she
was
taken
was
to
bathe
her
eyes
and
brush
her
hair
she
felt
dimly
that
she
must
keep
her
head
clear
her
second
was
to
scribble
a
note
to
wake
telling
him
what
had
happened
and
to
give
it
to
the
servant
with
a
tip
gentleman
will
come
in
the
morning
she
said
must
give
it
him
at
once
for
it
concerns
the
fate
of
your
country
the
woman
grinned
and
promised
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
done
errands
for
pretty
ladies
ivery
settled
her
in
the
great
closed
car
with
much
solicitude
and
made
her
comfortable
with
rugs
then
he
went
back
to
the
inn
for
a
second
and
she
saw
a
light
move
in
the
he
returned
and
spoke
to
the
driver
in
german
taking
his
seat
beside
him
but
first
he
handed
mary
her
note
to
wake
think
you
left
this
behind
you
he
said
he
had
not
opened
it
alone
in
the
car
mary
slept
she
saw
the
figures
of
ivery
and
the
chauffeur
in
the
front
seat
dark
against
the
headlights
and
then
they
dislimned
into
dreams
she
had
undergone
a
greater
strain
than
she
knew
and
was
sunk
in
the
heavy
sleep
of
weary
nerves
when
she
woke
it
was
daylight
they
were
still
in
italy
as
her
first
glance
told
her
so
they
could
not
have
taken
the
staub
route
they
seemed
to
be
among
the
foothills
for
there
was
little
snow
but
now
and
then
up
tributary
valleys
she
had
glimpses
of
the
high
peaks
she
tried
hard
to
think
what
it
could
mean
and
then
remembered
the
marjolana
wake
had
laboured
to
instruct
her
in
the
topography
of
the
alps
and
she
had
grasped
the
fact
of
the
two
open
passes
but
the
marjolana
meant
a
big
circuit
and
they
would
not
be
in
switzerland
till
the
evening
they
would
arrive
in
the
dark
and
pass
out
of
it
in
the
dark
and
there
would
be
no
chance
of
succour
she
felt
very
lonely
and
very
weak
throughout
the
morning
her
fear
grew
the
more
hopeless
her
chance
of
defeating
ivery
became
the
more
insistently
the
dark
shadow
crept
over
her
mind
she
tried
to
steady
herself
by
watching
the
show
from
the
windows
the
car
swung
through
little
villages
past
vineyards
and
and
the
blue
of
lakes
and
over
the
gorges
of
mountain
streams
there
seemed
to
be
no
trouble
about
passports
the
sentries
at
the
controls
waved
a
reassuring
hand
when
they
were
shown
some
card
which
the
chauffeur
held
between
his
teeth
in
one
place
there
was
a
longish
halt
and
she
could
hear
ivery
talking
italian
with
two
officers
of
bersaglieri
to
whom
he
gave
cigars
they
were
upstanding
boys
and
for
a
second
she
had
an
idea
of
flinging
open
the
door
and
appealing
to
them
to
save
her
but
that
would
have
been
futile
for
ivery
was
clearly
amply
certificated
she
wondered
what
part
he
was
now
playing
the
marjolana
route
had
been
chosen
for
a
purpose
in
one
town
ivery
met
and
talked
to
a
civilian
official
and
more
than
once
the
car
slowed
down
and
someone
appeared
from
the
wayside
to
speak
a
word
and
vanish
she
was
assisting
at
the
last
gathering
up
of
the
threads
of
a
great
plan
before
the
wild
birds
returned
to
their
nest
mostly
these
conferences
seemed
to
be
in
italian
but
once
or
twice
she
gathered
from
the
movement
of
the
lips
that
german
was
spoken
and
that
this
rough
peasant
or
that
bourgeois
was
not
of
italian
blood
early
in
the
morning
soon
after
she
awoke
ivery
had
stopped
the
car
and
offered
her
a
luncheon
basket
she
could
eat
nothing
and
watched
him
breakfast
off
sandwiches
beside
the
driver
in
the
afternoon
he
asked
her
permission
to
sit
with
her
the
car
drew
up
in
a
lonely
place
and
a
was
produced
by
the
chauffeur
ivery
made
tea
for
she
seemed
too
listless
to
move
and
she
drank
a
cup
with
him
after
that
he
remained
beside
her
half
an
hour
we
shall
be
out
of
italy
he
said
the
car
was
running
up
a
long
valley
to
the
curious
hollow
between
snowy
saddles
which
is
the
crest
of
the
marjolana
he
showed
her
the
place
on
a
road
map
as
the
altitude
increased
and
the
air
grew
colder
he
wrapped
the
rugs
closer
around
her
and
apologized
for
the
absence
of
a
a
little
he
said
shall
be
in
the
land
where
your
slightest
wish
will
be
law
she
dozed
again
and
so
missed
the
frontier
post
when
she
woke
the
car
was
slipping
down
the
long
curves
of
the
weiss
valley
before
it
narrows
to
the
gorge
through
which
it
debouches
on
grunewald
are
in
switzerland
now
she
heard
his
voice
say
it
may
have
been
fancy
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
a
new
note
in
it
he
spoke
to
her
with
the
assurance
of
possession
they
were
outside
the
country
of
the
allies
and
in
a
land
where
his
web
was
thickly
spread
do
we
stop
tonight
she
asked
timidly
fear
we
can
not
stop
tonight
also
you
must
put
up
with
the
car
i
have
a
little
errand
to
do
on
the
way
which
will
delay
us
a
few
minutes
and
then
we
press
on
tomorrow
my
fairest
one
fatigue
will
be
ended
there
was
no
mistake
now
about
the
note
of
possession
in
his
voice
mary
heart
began
to
beat
fast
and
wild
the
trap
had
closed
down
on
her
and
she
saw
the
folly
of
her
courage
it
had
delivered
her
bound
and
gagged
into
the
hands
of
one
whom
she
loathed
more
deeply
every
moment
whose
proximity
was
less
welcome
than
a
snake
she
had
to
bite
hard
on
her
lip
to
keep
from
screaming
the
weather
had
changed
and
it
was
snowing
hard
the
same
storm
that
had
greeted
us
on
the
col
of
the
swallows
the
pace
was
slower
now
and
ivery
grew
restless
he
looked
frequently
at
his
watch
and
snatched
the
to
talk
to
the
driver
mary
caught
the
word
anton
we
go
by
st
anton
she
found
voice
to
ask
he
said
shortly
the
word
gave
her
the
faintest
glimmering
of
hope
for
she
knew
that
peter
and
i
had
lived
at
st
anton
she
tried
to
look
out
of
the
blurred
window
but
could
see
nothing
except
that
the
twilight
was
falling
she
begged
for
the
and
saw
that
so
far
as
she
could
make
out
they
were
still
in
the
broad
grunewald
valley
and
that
to
reach
st
anton
they
had
to
cross
the
low
pass
from
the
staubthal
the
snow
was
still
drifting
thick
and
the
car
crawled
then
she
felt
the
rise
as
they
mounted
to
the
pass
here
the
going
was
bad
very
different
from
the
dry
frost
in
which
i
had
covered
the
same
road
the
night
before
moreover
there
seemed
to
be
curious
obstacles
some
careless
had
dropped
logs
on
the
highway
and
more
than
once
both
ivery
and
the
chauffeur
had
to
get
out
to
shift
them
in
one
place
there
had
been
a
small
landslide
which
left
little
room
to
pass
and
mary
had
to
descend
and
cross
on
foot
while
the
driver
took
the
car
over
alone
ivery
temper
seemed
to
be
souring
to
the
girl
relief
he
resumed
the
outside
seat
where
he
was
engaged
in
constant
argument
with
the
chauffeur
at
the
head
of
the
pass
stands
an
inn
the
comfortable
hostelry
of
herr
kronig
well
known
to
all
who
clamber
among
the
lesser
peaks
of
the
staubthal
there
in
the
middle
of
the
way
stood
a
man
with
a
lantern
road
is
blocked
by
a
snowfall
he
cried
are
clearing
it
now
it
will
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
time
ivery
sprang
from
his
seat
and
darted
into
the
hotel
his
business
was
to
speed
up
the
clearing
party
and
herr
kronig
himself
accompanied
him
to
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
mary
sat
still
for
she
had
suddenly
become
possessed
of
an
idea
she
drove
it
from
her
as
foolishness
but
it
kept
returning
why
had
those
been
spilt
on
the
road
why
had
an
easy
pass
after
a
moderate
snowfall
been
suddenly
closed
a
man
came
out
of
the
and
spoke
to
the
chauffeur
it
seemed
to
be
an
offer
of
refreshment
for
the
latter
left
his
seat
and
disappeared
inside
he
was
away
for
some
time
and
returned
shivering
and
grumbling
at
the
weather
with
the
collar
of
his
greatcoat
turned
up
around
his
ears
a
lantern
had
been
hung
in
the
porch
and
as
he
passed
mary
saw
the
man
she
had
been
watching
the
back
of
his
head
idly
during
the
long
drive
and
had
observed
that
it
was
of
the
round
bullet
type
with
no
nape
to
the
neck
which
is
common
in
the
fatherland
now
she
could
not
see
his
neck
for
the
coat
collar
but
she
could
have
sworn
that
the
head
was
a
different
shape
the
man
seemed
to
suffer
acutely
from
the
cold
for
he
buttoned
the
collar
round
his
chin
and
pulled
his
cap
far
over
his
brows
ivery
came
back
followed
by
a
dragging
line
of
men
with
spades
and
lanterns
he
flung
himself
into
the
front
seat
and
nodded
to
the
driver
to
start
the
man
had
his
engine
going
already
so
as
to
lose
no
time
he
bumped
over
the
rough
debris
of
the
snowfall
and
then
fairly
let
the
car
hum
ivery
was
anxious
for
speed
but
he
did
not
want
his
neck
broken
and
he
yelled
out
to
take
care
the
driver
nodded
and
slowed
down
but
presently
he
had
got
up
speed
again
if
ivery
was
restless
mary
was
worse
she
seemed
suddenly
to
have
come
on
the
traces
of
her
friends
in
the
st
anton
valley
the
snow
had
stopped
and
she
let
down
the
window
for
air
for
she
was
choking
with
suspense
the
car
rushed
past
the
station
down
the
hill
by
cottage
through
the
village
and
along
the
lake
shore
to
the
pink
chalet
ivery
halted
it
at
the
gate
that
you
fill
up
with
petrol
he
told
the
man
gustav
get
the
daimler
and
be
ready
to
follow
in
half
in
hour
he
spoke
to
mary
through
the
open
window
will
keep
you
only
a
very
little
time
i
think
you
had
better
wait
in
the
car
for
it
will
be
more
comfortable
than
a
dismantled
house
a
servant
will
bring
you
food
and
more
rugs
for
the
night
journey
then
he
vanished
up
the
dark
avenue
mary
first
thought
was
to
slip
out
and
get
back
to
the
village
and
there
to
find
someone
who
knew
me
or
could
take
her
where
peter
lived
but
the
driver
would
prevent
her
for
he
had
been
left
behind
on
guard
she
looked
anxiously
at
his
back
for
he
alone
stood
between
her
and
liberty
that
gentleman
seemed
to
be
intent
on
his
own
business
as
soon
as
ivery
footsteps
had
grown
faint
he
had
backed
the
car
into
the
entrance
and
turned
it
so
that
it
faced
towards
st
anton
then
very
slowly
it
began
to
move
at
the
same
moment
a
whistle
was
blown
shrilly
three
times
the
door
on
the
right
had
opened
and
someone
who
had
been
waiting
in
the
shadows
climbed
painfully
in
mary
saw
that
it
was
a
little
man
and
that
he
was
a
cripple
she
reached
a
hand
to
help
him
and
he
fell
on
to
the
cushions
beside
her
the
car
was
gathering
speed
before
she
realized
what
was
happening
the
had
taken
her
hand
and
was
patting
it
about
two
minutes
later
i
was
entering
the
gate
of
the
pink
chalet
chapter
nineteen
the
cage
of
the
wild
birds
mr
ivery
come
right
in
said
the
voice
at
the
table
there
was
a
screen
before
me
stretching
from
the
fireplace
to
keep
off
the
draught
from
the
door
by
which
i
had
entered
it
stood
higher
than
my
head
but
there
were
cracks
in
it
through
which
i
could
watch
the
room
i
found
a
little
table
on
which
i
could
lean
my
back
for
i
was
dropping
with
fatigue
blenkiron
sat
at
the
and
in
front
of
him
were
little
rows
of
patience
cards
wood
ashes
still
smouldered
in
the
stove
and
a
lamp
stood
at
his
right
elbow
which
lit
up
the
two
figures
the
bookshelves
and
the
cabinets
were
in
twilight
been
hoping
to
see
you
for
quite
a
time
blenkiron
was
busy
arranging
the
little
heaps
of
cards
and
his
face
was
wreathed
in
hospitable
smiles
i
remember
wondering
why
he
should
play
the
host
to
the
true
master
of
the
house
ivery
stood
erect
before
him
he
was
rather
a
splendid
figure
now
that
he
had
sloughed
all
disguises
and
was
on
the
threshold
of
his
triumph
even
through
the
fog
in
which
my
brain
worked
it
was
forced
upon
me
that
here
was
a
man
born
to
play
a
big
part
he
had
a
jowl
like
a
roman
king
on
a
coin
and
scornful
eyes
that
were
used
to
mastery
he
was
younger
than
me
confound
him
and
now
he
looked
it
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
speaker
while
a
smile
played
round
his
mouth
a
very
ugly
smile
he
said
have
caught
the
old
crow
too
i
had
scarcely
hoped
for
such
good
fortune
and
to
speak
the
truth
i
had
not
concerned
myself
much
about
you
but
now
we
shall
add
you
to
the
bag
and
what
a
bag
of
vermin
to
lay
out
on
the
lawn
he
flung
back
his
head
and
laughed
ivery
blenkiron
began
but
was
cut
short
that
name
all
that
is
past
thank
god
i
am
the
graf
von
schwabing
an
officer
of
the
imperial
guard
i
am
not
the
least
of
the
weapons
that
germany
has
used
to
break
her
enemies
do
say
drawled
blenkiron
still
fiddling
with
his
patience
cards
the
man
moment
had
come
and
he
was
minded
not
to
miss
a
jot
of
his
triumph
his
figure
seemed
to
expand
his
eye
kindled
his
voice
rang
with
pride
it
was
melodrama
of
the
best
kind
and
he
fairly
rolled
it
round
his
tongue
i
do
think
i
grudged
it
him
for
i
was
fingering
something
in
my
pocket
he
had
won
all
right
but
he
would
enjoy
his
victory
long
for
soon
i
would
shoot
him
i
had
my
eye
on
the
very
spot
above
his
right
ear
where
i
meant
to
put
my
bullet
for
i
was
very
clear
that
to
kill
him
was
the
only
way
to
protect
mary
i
feared
the
whole
seventy
millions
of
germany
less
than
this
man
that
was
the
single
idea
that
remained
firm
against
the
immense
fatigue
that
pressed
down
on
me
have
little
time
to
waste
on
you
said
he
who
had
been
called
ivery
i
will
spare
a
moment
to
tell
you
a
few
truths
your
childish
game
never
had
a
chance
i
played
with
you
in
england
and
i
have
played
with
you
ever
since
you
have
never
made
a
move
but
i
have
quietly
countered
it
why
man
you
gave
me
your
confidence
the
american
mr
donne
about
clarence
asked
blenkiron
his
face
seemed
a
study
in
pure
bewilderment
was
that
interesting
journalist
to
think
of
that
said
blenkiron
in
a
sad
gentle
voice
thought
i
was
safe
with
clarence
why
he
brought
me
a
letter
from
old
joe
hooper
and
he
knew
all
the
boys
down
emporia
way
ivery
laughed
have
never
done
me
justice
i
fear
but
i
think
you
will
do
it
now
your
gang
is
helpless
in
my
hands
general
hannay
and
i
wish
i
could
give
you
a
notion
of
the
scorn
with
which
he
pronounced
the
word
dick
said
blenkiron
intently
has
been
my
prisoner
for
hours
and
the
pretty
miss
mary
too
you
are
all
going
with
me
in
a
little
to
my
own
country
you
will
not
guess
how
we
call
it
the
underground
railway
and
you
will
have
the
privilege
of
studying
its
working
i
had
not
troubled
much
about
you
for
i
had
no
special
dislike
of
you
you
are
only
a
blundering
fool
what
you
call
in
your
country
easy
fruit
thank
you
graf
blenkiron
said
solemnly
since
you
are
here
you
will
join
the
others
one
last
word
to
beat
inepts
such
as
you
is
nothing
there
is
a
far
greater
thing
my
country
has
conquered
you
and
your
friends
will
be
dragged
at
the
chariot
wheels
of
a
triumph
such
as
rome
never
saw
does
that
penetrate
your
thick
skull
germany
has
won
and
in
two
days
the
whole
round
earth
will
be
stricken
dumb
by
her
greatness
as
i
watched
blenkiron
a
grey
shadow
of
hopelessness
seemed
to
settle
on
his
face
his
big
body
drooped
in
his
chair
his
eyes
fell
and
his
left
hand
shuffled
limply
among
his
patience
cards
i
could
not
get
my
mind
to
work
but
i
puzzled
miserably
over
his
amazing
blunders
he
had
walked
blindly
into
the
pit
his
enemies
had
dug
for
him
peter
must
have
failed
to
get
my
message
to
him
and
he
knew
nothing
of
last
night
work
or
my
mad
journey
to
italy
we
had
all
bungled
the
whole
wretched
bunch
of
us
peter
and
blenkiron
and
myself
i
had
a
feeling
at
the
back
of
my
head
that
there
was
something
in
it
all
that
i
could
understand
that
the
catastrophe
could
not
be
quite
as
simple
as
it
seemed
but
i
had
no
power
to
think
with
the
insolent
figure
of
ivery
dominating
the
room
thank
god
i
had
a
bullet
waiting
for
him
that
was
the
one
fixed
point
in
the
chaos
of
my
mind
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
resolute
on
killing
one
particular
man
and
the
purpose
gave
me
a
horrid
comfort
suddenly
ivery
voice
rang
out
sharp
your
hand
out
of
your
pocket
you
fool
you
are
covered
from
three
points
in
the
walls
a
movement
and
my
men
will
make
a
sieve
of
you
others
before
you
have
sat
in
that
chair
and
i
am
used
to
take
precautions
quick
both
hands
on
the
table
there
was
no
mistake
about
blenkiron
defeat
he
was
done
and
out
and
i
was
left
with
the
only
card
he
leaned
wearily
on
his
arms
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
spread
out
reckon
you
gotten
a
strong
hand
graf
he
said
and
his
voice
was
flat
with
despair
hold
a
royal
flush
was
the
answer
and
then
suddenly
came
a
change
blenkiron
raised
his
head
and
his
sleepy
ruminating
eyes
looked
straight
at
ivery
call
you
he
said
i
did
believe
my
ears
nor
did
ivery
hour
for
bluff
is
past
he
said
i
call
you
at
that
moment
i
felt
someone
squeeze
through
the
door
behind
me
and
take
his
place
at
my
side
the
light
was
so
dim
that
i
saw
only
a
short
square
figure
but
a
familiar
voice
whispered
in
my
ear
me
andra
amos
man
this
is
a
great
ploy
i
here
to
see
the
end
no
prisoner
waiting
on
the
finding
of
the
jury
no
commander
expecting
news
of
a
great
battle
ever
hung
in
more
desperate
suspense
than
i
did
during
the
next
seconds
i
had
forgotten
my
fatigue
my
back
no
longer
needed
support
i
kept
my
eyes
glued
to
the
crack
in
the
screen
and
my
ears
drank
in
greedily
every
syllable
blenkiron
was
now
sitting
bolt
upright
with
his
chin
in
his
hands
there
was
no
shadow
of
melancholy
in
his
lean
face
say
i
call
you
herr
graf
von
schwabing
i
going
to
put
you
wise
about
some
little
things
you
do
carry
arms
so
i
need
warn
you
against
monkeying
with
a
gun
you
right
in
saying
that
there
are
three
places
in
these
walls
from
which
you
can
shoot
well
for
your
information
i
may
tell
you
that
there
guns
in
all
three
but
covering
at
this
moment
so
you
better
be
good
ivery
sprang
to
attention
like
a
ramrod
he
cried
as
if
by
magic
figures
stood
on
either
side
of
him
like
warders
by
a
criminal
they
were
not
the
sleek
german
footmen
whom
i
had
seen
at
the
chalet
one
i
did
not
recognize
the
other
was
my
servant
geordie
hamilton
he
gave
them
one
glance
looked
round
like
a
hunted
animal
and
then
steadied
himself
the
man
had
his
own
kind
of
courage
gotten
something
to
say
to
you
blenkiron
drawled
been
a
tough
fight
but
i
reckon
the
hot
end
of
the
poker
is
with
you
i
compliment
you
on
clarence
donne
you
fooled
me
fine
over
that
business
and
it
was
only
by
the
mercy
of
god
you
did
win
out
you
see
there
was
just
the
one
of
us
who
was
liable
to
recognize
you
whatever
way
you
twisted
your
face
and
that
was
dick
hannay
i
give
you
good
marks
for
clarence
for
the
rest
i
had
you
beaten
flat
he
looked
steadily
at
him
do
believe
it
well
i
give
you
proof
i
been
watching
your
underground
railway
for
quite
a
time
i
had
my
men
on
the
job
and
i
reckon
most
of
the
lines
are
now
closed
for
repairs
all
but
the
trunk
line
into
france
that
keeping
open
for
soon
there
going
to
be
some
traffic
on
it
at
that
i
saw
ivery
eyelids
quiver
for
all
his
he
was
breaking
admit
we
cut
it
mighty
fine
along
of
your
fooling
me
about
clarence
but
you
struck
a
bad
snag
in
general
hannay
graf
your
talk
with
him
was
poor
business
you
reckoned
you
had
him
safe
but
that
was
too
big
a
risk
to
take
with
a
man
like
dick
unless
you
saw
him
cold
before
you
left
him
he
got
away
from
this
place
and
early
this
morning
i
knew
all
he
knew
after
that
it
was
easy
i
got
the
telegram
you
had
sent
this
morning
in
the
name
of
clarence
donne
and
it
made
me
laugh
before
midday
i
had
this
whole
outfit
under
my
hand
your
servants
have
gone
by
the
underground
railway
to
france
ehrlich
well
i
sorry
about
ehrlich
i
knew
now
the
name
of
the
portuguese
jew
was
a
bad
sort
of
man
blenkiron
said
regretfully
he
was
plumb
honest
i
could
get
him
to
listen
to
reason
and
he
would
play
with
firearms
so
i
had
to
shoot
asked
ivery
sharply
i
do
miss
and
it
was
him
or
me
he
under
the
ice
now
where
you
wanted
to
send
dick
hannay
he
was
your
kind
graf
and
i
guess
he
has
some
chance
of
getting
into
heaven
if
i
were
a
presbyterian
i
say
a
prayer
for
his
soul
i
looked
only
at
ivery
his
face
had
gone
very
pale
and
his
eyes
were
wandering
i
am
certain
his
brain
was
working
at
lightning
speed
but
he
was
a
rat
in
a
steel
trap
and
the
springs
held
him
if
ever
i
saw
a
man
going
through
hell
it
was
now
his
pasteboard
castle
had
crumbled
about
his
ears
and
he
was
giddy
with
the
fall
of
it
the
man
was
made
of
pride
and
every
proud
nerve
of
him
was
caught
on
the
raw
much
for
ordinary
business
said
blenkiron
the
matter
of
a
certain
lady
you
have
behaved
about
her
graf
but
not
going
to
blame
you
you
maybe
heard
a
whistle
blow
when
you
were
coming
in
here
no
why
it
sounded
like
gabriel
trump
peter
must
have
put
some
lung
power
into
it
well
that
was
the
signal
that
miss
mary
was
safe
in
your
car
but
in
our
charge
comprehend
he
did
the
ghost
of
a
flush
appeared
in
his
cheeks
ask
about
general
hannay
i
not
just
exactly
sure
where
dick
is
at
the
moment
but
i
opine
he
in
italy
i
kicked
aside
the
screen
thereby
causing
amos
almost
to
fall
on
his
face
back
i
said
and
pulled
up
an
and
dropped
into
it
i
think
the
sight
of
me
was
the
last
straw
for
ivery
i
was
a
wild
enough
figure
grey
with
weariness
soaked
dirty
with
the
clothes
of
the
porter
joseph
zimmer
in
rags
from
the
sharp
rocks
of
the
schwarzsteinthor
as
his
eyes
caught
mine
they
wavered
and
i
saw
terror
in
them
he
knew
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
mortal
enemy
dick
said
blenkiron
with
a
beaming
face
is
mighty
opportune
how
in
creation
did
you
get
here
walked
i
said
i
did
not
want
to
have
to
speak
for
i
was
too
tired
i
wanted
to
watch
ivery
face
blenkiron
gathered
up
his
patience
cards
slipped
them
into
a
little
leather
case
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
one
thing
more
to
tell
you
the
wild
birds
have
been
summoned
home
but
they
wo
ever
make
it
we
gathered
them
in
pavia
and
hofgaard
and
conradi
ehrlich
is
dead
and
you
are
going
to
join
the
rest
in
our
cage
as
i
looked
at
my
friend
his
figure
seemed
to
gain
in
presence
he
sat
square
in
his
chair
with
a
face
like
a
hanging
judge
and
his
eyes
sleepy
no
more
held
ivery
as
in
a
vice
he
had
dropped
too
his
drawl
and
the
idioms
of
his
ordinary
speech
and
his
voice
came
out
hard
and
massive
like
the
clash
of
granite
blocks
at
the
bar
now
graf
von
schwabing
for
years
you
done
your
best
against
the
decencies
of
life
you
have
deserved
well
of
your
country
i
do
doubt
it
but
what
has
your
country
deserved
of
the
world
one
day
soon
germany
has
to
do
some
heavy
paying
and
you
are
the
first
instalment
appeal
to
the
swiss
law
i
stand
on
swiss
soil
and
i
demand
that
i
be
surrendered
to
the
swiss
authorities
ivery
spoke
with
dry
lips
and
the
sweat
was
on
his
brow
no
no
said
blenkiron
soothingly
swiss
are
a
nice
people
and
i
would
hate
to
add
to
the
worries
of
a
poor
little
neutral
state
all
along
both
sides
have
been
outside
the
law
in
this
game
and
that
going
to
continue
we
abode
by
the
rules
and
so
must
you
for
years
you
murdered
and
kidnapped
and
seduced
the
weak
and
ignorant
but
we
not
going
to
judge
your
morals
we
leave
that
to
the
almighty
when
you
get
across
jordan
we
going
to
wash
our
hands
of
you
as
soon
as
we
can
you
travel
to
france
by
the
underground
railway
and
there
be
handed
over
to
the
french
government
from
what
i
know
they
enough
against
you
to
shoot
you
every
hour
of
the
day
for
a
twelvemonth
i
think
he
had
expected
to
be
condemned
by
us
there
and
then
and
sent
to
join
ehrlich
beneath
the
ice
anyhow
there
came
a
flicker
of
hope
into
his
eyes
i
daresay
he
saw
some
way
to
dodge
the
french
authorities
if
he
once
got
a
chance
to
use
his
miraculous
wits
anyhow
he
bowed
with
something
very
like
and
asked
permission
to
smoke
as
i
have
said
the
man
had
his
own
courage
i
cried
going
to
do
nothing
of
the
kind
he
inclined
his
head
gravely
towards
me
your
notion
dick
got
to
make
the
punishment
fit
the
crime
i
said
i
was
so
tired
that
i
had
to
form
my
sentences
laboriously
as
if
i
were
speaking
a
foreign
tongue
mean
that
if
you
hand
him
over
to
the
french
he
either
twist
out
of
their
hands
somehow
or
get
decently
shot
which
is
far
too
good
for
him
this
man
and
his
kind
have
sent
millions
of
honest
folk
to
their
graves
he
has
sat
spinning
his
web
like
a
great
spider
and
for
every
thread
there
has
been
an
ocean
of
blood
spilled
it
his
sort
that
made
the
war
not
the
brave
stupid
fighting
boche
it
his
sort
that
responsible
for
all
the
clotted
beastliness
and
he
never
been
in
sight
of
a
shell
i
for
putting
him
in
the
front
line
no
i
do
mean
any
uriah
the
hittite
business
i
want
him
to
have
a
sporting
chance
just
what
other
men
have
but
by
god
he
going
to
learn
what
is
the
upshot
of
the
strings
he
been
pulling
so
merrily
he
told
me
in
two
days
time
germany
would
smash
our
armies
to
hell
he
boasted
that
he
would
be
mostly
responsible
for
it
well
let
him
be
there
to
see
the
smashing
reckon
that
just
said
blenkiron
ivery
eyes
were
on
me
now
fascinated
and
terrified
like
those
of
a
bird
before
a
rattlesnake
i
saw
again
the
shapeless
features
of
the
man
in
the
tube
station
the
residuum
of
shrinking
mortality
behind
his
disguises
he
seemed
to
be
slipping
something
from
his
pocket
towards
his
mouth
but
geordie
hamilton
caught
his
wrist
ye
offer
said
the
scandalized
voice
of
my
servant
the
prisoner
would
appear
to
be
trying
to
puishon
hisself
wull
i
search
him
after
that
he
stood
with
each
arm
in
the
grip
of
a
warder
ivery
i
said
night
when
i
was
in
your
power
you
indulged
your
vanity
by
gloating
over
me
i
expected
it
for
your
class
does
not
breed
gentlemen
we
treat
our
prisoners
differently
but
it
is
fair
that
you
should
know
your
fate
you
are
going
into
france
and
i
will
see
that
you
are
taken
to
the
british
front
there
with
my
old
division
you
will
learn
something
of
the
meaning
of
war
understand
that
by
no
conceivable
chance
can
you
escape
men
will
be
detailed
to
watch
you
day
and
night
and
to
see
that
you
undergo
the
full
rigour
of
the
battlefield
you
will
have
the
same
experience
as
other
people
no
more
no
less
i
believe
in
a
righteous
god
and
i
know
that
sooner
or
later
you
will
find
death
death
at
the
hands
of
your
own
people
an
honourable
death
which
is
far
beyond
your
deserts
but
before
it
comes
you
will
have
understood
the
hell
to
which
you
have
condemned
honest
men
in
moments
of
great
fatigue
as
in
moments
of
great
crisis
the
mind
takes
charge
and
may
run
on
a
track
independent
of
the
will
it
was
not
myself
that
spoke
but
an
impersonal
voice
which
i
did
not
know
a
voice
in
whose
tones
rang
a
strange
authority
ivery
recognized
the
icy
finality
of
it
and
his
body
seemed
to
wilt
and
droop
only
the
hold
of
the
warders
kept
him
from
falling
i
too
was
about
at
the
end
of
my
endurance
i
felt
dimly
that
the
room
had
emptied
except
for
blenkiron
and
amos
and
that
the
former
was
trying
to
make
me
drink
brandy
from
the
cup
of
a
flask
i
struggled
to
my
feet
with
the
intention
of
going
to
mary
but
my
legs
would
not
carry
me
i
heard
as
in
a
dream
amos
giving
thanks
to
an
omnipotence
in
whom
he
officially
disbelieved
that
the
auld
man
in
the
bible
said
now
let
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
that
the
way
i
feelin
mysel
and
then
slumber
came
on
me
like
an
armed
man
and
in
the
chair
by
the
dying
i
slept
off
the
ache
of
my
limbs
the
tension
of
my
nerves
and
the
confusion
of
my
brain
chapter
twenty
the
storm
breaks
in
the
west
the
following
evening
it
was
the
day
of
march
i
started
for
france
after
the
dark
fell
i
drove
ivery
big
closed
car
and
within
sat
its
owner
bound
and
gagged
as
others
had
sat
before
him
on
the
same
errand
geordie
hamilton
and
amos
were
his
companions
from
what
blenkiron
had
himself
discovered
and
from
the
papers
seized
in
the
pink
chalet
i
had
full
details
of
the
road
and
its
mysterious
stages
it
was
like
the
journey
of
a
mad
dream
in
a
back
street
of
a
little
town
i
would
exchange
passwords
with
a
nameless
figure
and
be
given
instructions
at
a
wayside
inn
at
an
appointed
hour
a
voice
speaking
a
thick
german
would
advise
that
this
bridge
or
that
railway
crossing
had
been
cleared
at
a
hamlet
among
pine
woods
an
unknown
man
would
clamber
up
beside
me
and
take
me
past
a
smooth
as
clockwork
was
the
machine
till
in
the
dawn
of
a
spring
morning
i
found
myself
dropping
into
a
broad
valley
through
little
orchards
just
beginning
to
blossom
and
i
knew
that
i
was
in
france
after
that
blenkiron
own
arrangements
began
and
soon
i
was
drinking
coffee
with
a
young
lieutenant
of
chasseurs
and
had
taken
the
gag
from
ivery
mouth
the
bluecoats
looked
curiously
at
the
man
in
the
green
ulster
whose
face
was
the
colour
of
clay
and
who
lit
cigarette
from
cigarette
with
a
shaky
hand
the
lieutenant
rang
up
a
general
of
division
who
knew
all
about
us
at
his
headquarters
i
explained
my
purpose
and
he
telegraphed
to
an
army
headquarters
for
a
permission
which
was
granted
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
in
january
i
had
seen
certain
great
personages
in
paris
and
that
blenkiron
had
wired
ahead
of
me
to
prepare
the
way
here
i
handed
over
ivery
and
his
guard
for
i
wanted
them
to
proceed
to
amiens
under
french
supervision
well
knowing
that
the
men
of
that
great
army
are
not
used
to
let
slip
what
they
once
hold
it
was
a
morning
of
clear
spring
sunlight
when
we
breakfasted
in
that
little
town
among
vineyards
with
a
shining
river
looping
at
our
feet
the
general
of
division
was
an
algerian
veteran
with
a
brush
of
grizzled
hair
whose
eye
kept
wandering
to
a
map
on
the
wall
where
pins
and
stretched
thread
made
a
spider
web
news
from
the
north
i
asked
yet
he
said
the
attack
comes
soon
it
will
be
against
our
army
in
champagne
with
a
lean
finger
he
pointed
out
the
enemy
dispositions
not
against
the
british
i
asked
with
a
knife
and
fork
i
made
a
right
angle
and
put
a
salt
dish
in
the
centre
is
the
german
concentration
they
can
so
mass
that
we
do
not
know
which
side
of
the
angle
they
will
strike
till
the
blow
falls
is
true
he
replied
consider
for
the
enemy
to
attack
towards
the
somme
would
be
to
fight
over
many
miles
of
an
old
where
all
is
still
desert
and
every
yard
of
which
you
british
know
in
champagne
at
a
bound
he
might
enter
unbroken
country
it
is
a
long
and
difficult
road
to
amiens
but
not
so
long
to
chilons
such
is
the
view
of
petain
does
it
convince
you
reasoning
is
good
nevertheless
he
will
strike
at
amiens
and
i
think
he
will
begin
today
he
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
are
obstinate
my
general
like
all
your
excellent
countrymen
but
as
i
left
his
headquarters
an
handed
him
a
message
on
a
pink
slip
he
read
it
and
turned
to
me
with
a
grave
face
have
a
flair
my
friend
i
am
glad
we
did
not
wager
this
morning
at
dawn
there
is
great
fighting
around
st
quentin
be
comforted
for
they
will
not
pass
your
will
hold
them
that
was
the
first
news
i
had
of
the
battle
at
dijon
according
to
plan
i
met
the
others
i
only
just
caught
the
paris
train
and
blenkiron
great
wrists
lugged
me
into
the
carriage
when
it
was
well
in
motion
there
sat
peter
a
docile
figure
in
a
carefully
patched
old
uniform
wake
was
reading
a
pile
of
french
papers
and
in
a
corner
mary
with
her
feet
up
on
the
seat
was
sound
asleep
we
did
not
talk
much
for
the
life
of
the
past
days
had
been
so
hectic
that
we
had
no
wish
to
recall
it
blenkiron
face
wore
an
air
of
satisfaction
and
as
he
looked
out
at
the
sunny
spring
landscape
he
hummed
his
only
tune
even
wake
had
lost
his
restlessness
he
had
on
a
pair
of
big
tortoiseshell
reading
glasses
and
when
he
looked
up
from
his
newspaper
and
caught
my
eye
he
smiled
mary
slept
like
a
child
delicately
flushed
her
breath
scarcely
stirring
the
collar
of
the
greatcoat
which
was
folded
across
her
throat
i
remember
looking
with
a
kind
of
awe
at
the
curve
of
her
young
face
and
the
long
lashes
that
lay
so
softly
on
her
cheek
and
wondering
how
i
had
borne
the
anxiety
of
the
last
months
wake
raised
his
head
from
his
reading
glanced
at
mary
and
then
at
me
and
his
eyes
were
kind
almost
affectionate
he
seemed
to
have
won
peace
of
mind
among
the
hills
only
peter
was
out
of
the
picture
he
was
a
strange
disconsolate
figure
as
he
shifted
about
to
ease
his
leg
or
gazed
incuriously
from
the
window
he
had
shaved
his
beard
again
but
it
did
not
make
him
younger
for
his
face
was
too
lined
and
his
eyes
too
old
to
change
when
i
spoke
to
him
he
looked
towards
mary
and
held
up
a
warning
finger
go
back
to
england
he
whispered
little
is
going
to
take
care
of
me
till
i
am
settled
we
spoke
of
it
yesterday
at
my
cottage
i
will
find
a
lodging
and
be
patient
till
the
war
is
over
and
you
dick
i
rejoin
my
division
thank
god
this
job
is
over
i
have
an
easy
now
and
can
turn
my
attention
to
soldiering
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
be
glad
to
think
that
you
and
mary
and
blenkiron
are
safe
at
home
what
about
you
wake
go
back
to
my
labour
battalion
he
said
cheerfully
you
i
have
an
easier
mind
i
shook
my
head
see
about
that
i
do
like
such
sinful
waste
we
had
a
bit
of
campaigning
together
and
i
know
your
quality
battalion
quite
good
enough
for
me
and
he
relapsed
into
a
mary
had
suddenly
woke
and
was
sitting
upright
with
her
fists
in
her
eyes
like
a
small
child
her
hand
flew
to
her
hair
and
her
eyes
ran
over
us
as
if
to
see
that
we
were
all
there
as
she
counted
the
four
of
us
she
seemed
relieved
reckon
you
feel
refreshed
miss
mary
said
blenkiron
good
to
think
that
now
we
can
sleep
in
peace
all
of
us
pretty
soon
you
be
in
england
and
spring
will
be
beginning
and
please
god
it
be
the
start
of
a
better
world
our
work
over
anyhow
wonder
said
the
girl
gravely
do
think
there
any
discharge
in
this
war
dick
have
you
news
of
the
battle
this
was
the
day
begun
i
said
and
told
them
the
little
i
had
learned
from
the
french
general
made
a
reputation
as
a
prophet
for
he
thought
the
attack
was
coming
in
champagne
it
st
quentin
right
enough
but
i
do
know
what
has
happened
we
hear
in
paris
mary
had
woke
with
a
startled
air
as
if
she
remembered
her
old
instinct
that
our
work
would
not
be
finished
without
a
sacrifice
and
that
sacrifice
the
best
of
us
the
notion
kept
recurring
to
me
with
an
uneasy
insistence
but
soon
she
appeared
to
forget
her
anxiety
that
afternoon
as
we
journeyed
through
the
pleasant
land
of
france
she
was
in
holiday
mood
and
she
forced
all
our
spirits
up
to
her
level
it
was
calm
bright
weather
the
long
curves
of
ploughland
were
beginning
to
quicken
into
green
the
catkins
made
a
blue
mist
on
the
willows
by
the
watercourses
and
in
the
orchards
by
the
hamlets
the
blossom
was
breaking
in
such
a
scene
it
was
hard
to
keep
the
mind
sober
and
grey
and
the
pall
of
war
slid
from
us
mary
cosseted
and
fussed
over
peter
like
an
elder
sister
over
a
delicate
little
boy
she
made
him
stretch
his
bad
leg
full
length
on
the
seat
and
when
she
made
tea
for
the
party
of
us
it
was
a
protesting
peter
who
had
the
last
sugar
biscuit
indeed
we
were
almost
a
merry
company
for
blenkiron
told
stories
of
old
hunting
and
engineering
days
in
the
west
and
peter
and
i
were
driven
to
cap
them
and
mary
asked
provocative
questions
and
wake
listened
with
amused
interest
it
was
well
that
we
had
the
carriage
to
ourselves
for
no
queerer
rigs
were
ever
assembled
mary
as
always
was
neat
and
workmanlike
in
her
dress
blenkiron
was
magnificent
in
a
suit
of
russet
tweed
with
a
shirt
and
collar
and
brown
shoes
but
peter
and
wake
were
in
uniforms
which
had
seen
far
better
days
and
i
wore
still
the
boots
and
the
shapeless
and
ragged
clothes
of
joseph
zimmer
the
porter
from
arosa
we
appeared
to
forget
the
war
but
we
did
for
it
was
in
the
background
of
all
our
minds
somewhere
in
the
north
there
was
raging
a
desperate
fight
and
its
issue
was
the
true
test
of
our
success
or
failure
mary
showed
it
by
bidding
me
ask
for
news
at
every
i
asked
gendarmes
and
but
i
learned
nothing
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
the
battle
the
upshot
was
that
for
the
last
hour
we
all
fell
silent
and
when
we
reached
paris
about
seven
my
first
errand
was
to
the
bookstall
i
bought
a
batch
of
evening
papers
which
we
tried
to
read
in
the
taxis
that
carried
us
to
our
hotel
sure
enough
there
was
the
announcement
in
big
headlines
the
enemy
had
attacked
in
great
strength
from
south
of
arras
to
the
oise
but
everywhere
he
had
been
repulsed
and
held
in
our
the
leading
articles
were
confident
the
notes
by
the
various
military
critics
were
almost
braggart
at
last
the
german
had
been
driven
to
an
offensive
and
the
allies
would
have
the
opportunity
they
had
longed
for
of
proving
their
superior
fighting
strength
it
was
said
one
and
all
the
opening
of
the
last
phase
of
the
war
i
confess
that
as
i
read
my
heart
sank
if
the
civilians
were
so
might
not
the
generals
have
fallen
into
the
same
trap
blenkiron
alone
was
unperturbed
mary
said
nothing
but
she
sat
with
her
chin
in
her
hands
which
with
her
was
a
sure
sign
of
deep
preoccupation
next
morning
the
papers
could
tell
us
little
more
the
main
attack
had
been
on
both
sides
of
st
quentin
and
though
the
british
had
given
ground
it
was
only
the
outposts
line
that
had
gone
the
mist
had
favoured
the
enemy
and
his
bombardment
had
been
terrific
especially
the
gas
shells
every
journal
added
the
old
old
comment
that
he
had
paid
heavily
for
his
temerity
with
losses
far
exceeding
those
of
the
defence
wake
appeared
at
breakfast
in
his
private
uniform
he
wanted
to
get
his
railway
warrant
and
be
off
at
once
but
when
i
heard
that
amiens
was
his
destination
i
ordered
him
to
stay
and
travel
with
me
in
the
afternoon
i
was
in
uniform
myself
now
and
had
taken
charge
of
the
outfit
i
arranged
that
blenkiron
mary
and
peter
should
go
on
to
boulogne
and
sleep
the
night
there
while
wake
and
i
would
be
dropped
at
amiens
to
await
instructions
i
spent
a
busy
morning
once
again
i
visited
with
blenkiron
the
little
cabinet
in
the
boulevard
st
germain
and
told
in
every
detail
our
work
of
the
past
two
months
once
again
i
sat
in
the
low
building
beside
the
invalides
and
talked
to
staff
officers
but
some
of
the
men
i
had
seen
on
the
first
visit
were
not
there
the
chiefs
of
the
french
army
had
gone
north
we
arranged
for
the
handling
of
the
wild
birds
now
safely
in
france
and
sanction
was
given
to
the
course
i
had
proposed
to
adopt
with
ivery
he
and
his
guard
were
on
their
way
to
amiens
and
i
would
meet
them
there
on
the
morrow
the
great
men
were
very
complimentary
to
us
so
complimentary
that
my
knowledge
of
grammatical
french
ebbed
away
and
i
could
only
stutter
in
reply
that
telegram
sent
by
blenkiron
on
the
night
of
the
from
the
information
given
me
in
the
pink
chalet
had
done
wonders
in
clearing
up
the
situation
but
when
i
asked
them
about
the
battle
they
could
tell
me
little
it
was
a
very
serious
attack
in
tremendous
force
but
the
british
line
was
strong
and
the
reserves
were
believed
to
be
sufficient
petain
and
foch
had
gone
north
to
consult
with
haig
the
situation
in
champagne
was
still
obscure
but
some
french
reserves
were
already
moving
thence
to
the
somme
sector
one
thing
they
did
show
me
the
british
dispositions
as
i
looked
at
the
plan
i
saw
that
my
old
division
was
in
the
thick
of
the
fighting
do
you
go
now
i
was
asked
amiens
and
then
please
god
to
the
battle
front
i
said
fortune
to
you
you
do
not
give
body
or
mind
much
rest
my
general
after
that
i
went
to
the
but
they
had
nothing
beyond
haig
communique
and
a
telephone
message
from
that
the
critical
sector
was
likely
to
be
that
between
st
quentin
and
the
oise
the
northern
pillar
of
our
defence
south
of
arras
which
they
had
been
nervous
about
had
stood
like
a
rock
that
pleased
me
for
my
old
battalion
of
the
lennox
highlanders
was
there
crossing
the
place
de
la
concorde
we
fell
in
with
a
british
staff
officer
of
my
acquaintance
who
was
just
starting
to
motor
back
to
from
paris
leave
he
had
a
longer
face
than
the
people
at
the
invalides
do
like
it
i
tell
you
he
said
this
mist
that
worries
me
i
went
down
the
whole
line
from
arras
to
the
oise
ten
days
ago
it
was
beautifully
sited
the
cleverest
thing
you
ever
saw
the
outpost
line
was
mostly
a
chain
of
blobs
redoubts
you
know
with
so
arranged
as
to
bring
flanking
fire
to
bear
on
the
advancing
enemy
but
mist
would
play
the
devil
with
that
scheme
for
the
enemy
would
be
past
the
place
for
flanking
fire
before
we
knew
it
oh
i
know
we
had
good
warning
and
had
the
manned
in
time
but
the
outpost
line
was
meant
to
hold
out
long
enough
to
get
everything
behind
in
order
and
i
ca
see
but
how
big
chunks
of
it
must
have
gone
in
the
first
rush
mind
you
banked
everything
on
that
it
damned
good
but
if
gone
flung
up
his
hands
we
good
reserves
i
asked
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
positions
prepared
behind
the
did
notice
any
he
said
dryly
and
was
off
before
i
could
get
more
out
of
him
look
rattled
dick
said
blenkiron
as
we
walked
to
the
hotel
seem
to
have
got
the
needle
it
silly
but
i
feel
worse
about
this
show
than
i
ever
felt
since
the
war
started
look
at
this
city
here
the
papers
take
it
easily
and
the
people
are
walking
about
as
if
nothing
was
happening
even
the
soldiers
are
worried
you
may
call
me
a
fool
to
take
it
so
hard
but
i
a
sense
in
my
bones
that
in
for
the
bloodiest
and
darkest
fight
of
our
lives
and
that
soon
paris
will
be
hearing
the
boche
guns
as
she
did
in
a
cheerful
old
jeremiah
well
i
glad
miss
mary
going
to
be
in
england
soon
seems
to
me
she
right
and
that
this
game
of
ours
is
quite
played
out
yet
i
envying
you
some
for
there
a
place
waiting
for
you
in
the
fighting
line
got
to
get
home
and
keep
people
heads
straight
there
the
weak
link
in
our
chain
and
there
a
mighty
lot
of
work
before
you
he
said
abstractedly
with
his
eye
on
the
top
of
the
vendome
column
the
train
that
afternoon
was
packed
with
officers
recalled
from
leave
and
it
took
all
the
combined
purchase
of
blenkiron
and
myself
to
get
a
carriage
reserved
for
our
little
party
at
the
last
moment
i
opened
the
door
to
admit
a
warm
and
agitated
captain
of
the
in
whom
i
recognized
my
friend
and
benefactor
archie
roylance
when
i
was
gettin
nice
and
clean
and
comfy
a
wire
comes
me
to
bundle
back
all
along
of
a
new
battle
it
a
cruel
war
sir
the
afflicted
young
man
mopped
his
forehead
grinned
cheerfully
at
blenkiron
glanced
critically
at
peter
then
caught
sight
of
mary
and
grew
at
once
acutely
conscious
of
his
appearance
he
smoothed
his
hair
adjusted
his
tie
and
became
desperately
sedate
i
introduced
him
to
peter
and
he
promptly
forgot
mary
existence
if
peter
had
had
any
vanity
in
him
it
would
have
been
flattered
by
the
frank
interest
and
admiration
in
the
boy
eyes
tremendously
glad
to
see
you
safe
back
sir
i
always
hoped
i
might
have
a
chance
of
meeting
you
we
want
you
badly
now
on
the
front
lensch
is
gettin
a
bit
uppish
then
his
eye
fell
on
peter
withered
leg
and
he
saw
that
he
had
blundered
he
blushed
scarlet
and
looked
his
apologies
but
they
were
needed
for
it
cheered
peter
to
meet
someone
who
talked
of
the
possibility
of
his
fighting
again
soon
the
two
were
deep
in
technicalities
the
appalling
technicalities
of
the
airman
it
was
no
good
listening
to
their
talk
for
you
could
make
nothing
of
it
but
it
was
bracing
up
peter
like
wine
archie
gave
him
a
minute
description
of
lensch
latest
doings
and
his
new
methods
he
too
had
heard
the
rumour
that
peter
had
mentioned
to
me
at
st
anton
of
a
new
boche
plane
with
mighty
engines
and
stumpy
wings
cunningly
cambered
which
was
a
devil
to
climb
but
no
specimens
had
yet
appeared
over
the
line
they
talked
of
bali
and
rhys
davids
and
bishop
and
mccudden
and
all
the
heroes
who
had
won
their
spurs
since
the
somme
and
of
the
new
british
makes
most
of
which
peter
had
never
seen
and
had
to
have
explained
to
him
outside
a
haze
had
drawn
over
the
meadows
with
the
twilight
i
pointed
it
out
to
blenkiron
the
fog
that
doing
us
this
march
weather
is
just
like
october
mist
morning
and
evening
i
wish
to
heaven
we
could
have
some
good
old
drenching
spring
rain
archie
was
discoursing
of
the
machine
always
stuck
to
it
for
it
a
marvel
in
its
way
but
it
has
my
heart
fairly
broke
the
general
here
knows
its
little
tricks
you
sir
whenever
things
get
really
excitin
the
engine
apt
to
quit
work
and
take
a
rest
whole
make
should
be
publicly
burned
i
said
with
gloomy
recollections
would
go
so
far
sir
the
old
gladas
has
surprisin
merits
on
her
day
there
nothing
like
her
for
pace
and
and
she
steers
as
sweet
as
a
racin
cutter
the
trouble
about
her
is
she
too
complicated
she
like
some
breeds
of
car
you
want
to
be
a
mechanical
genius
to
understand
her
if
they
only
get
her
a
little
simpler
and
safer
there
would
be
her
match
in
the
field
i
about
the
only
man
that
has
patience
with
her
and
knows
her
merits
but
she
often
been
nearly
the
death
of
me
all
the
same
if
i
were
in
for
a
big
fight
against
some
fellow
like
lensch
where
it
was
neck
or
nothing
hanged
if
i
would
pick
the
gladas
archie
laughed
apologetically
subject
is
banned
for
me
in
our
mess
i
the
old
thing
only
champion
and
she
like
a
mare
i
used
to
hunt
that
loved
me
so
much
she
was
always
tryin
to
chew
the
arm
off
me
but
i
wish
i
could
get
her
a
fair
trial
from
one
of
the
big
pilots
i
only
in
the
second
class
myself
after
all
we
were
running
north
of
st
just
when
above
the
rattle
of
the
train
rose
a
curious
dull
sound
it
came
from
the
east
and
was
like
the
low
growl
of
a
veld
thunderstorm
or
a
steady
roll
of
muffled
drums
to
the
guns
cried
archie
aunt
there
a
tidy
bombardment
goin
on
somewhere
i
had
been
listening
on
and
off
to
guns
for
three
years
i
had
been
present
at
the
big
preparations
before
loos
and
the
somme
and
arras
and
i
had
come
to
accept
the
racket
of
artillery
as
something
natural
and
inevitable
like
rain
or
sunshine
but
this
sound
chilled
me
with
its
eeriness
i
do
know
why
perhaps
it
was
its
unexpectedness
for
i
was
sure
that
the
guns
had
not
been
heard
in
this
area
since
before
the
marne
the
noise
must
be
travelling
down
the
oise
valley
and
i
judged
there
was
big
fighting
somewhere
about
chauny
or
la
fere
that
meant
that
the
enemy
was
pressing
hard
on
a
huge
front
for
here
was
clearly
a
great
effort
on
his
extreme
left
wing
unless
it
was
our
but
somehow
i
did
think
so
i
let
down
the
window
and
stuck
my
head
into
the
night
the
fog
had
crept
to
the
edge
of
the
track
a
gossamer
mist
through
which
houses
and
trees
and
cattle
could
be
seen
dim
in
the
moonlight
the
noise
continued
not
a
mutter
but
a
steady
rumbling
flow
as
solid
as
the
blare
of
a
trumpet
presently
as
we
drew
nearer
amiens
we
left
it
behind
us
for
in
all
the
somme
valley
there
is
some
curious
configuration
which
blankets
sound
the
countryfolk
call
it
the
land
and
during
the
first
phase
of
the
somme
battle
a
man
in
amiens
could
not
hear
the
guns
twenty
miles
off
at
albert
as
i
sat
down
again
i
found
that
the
company
had
fallen
silent
even
the
garrulous
archie
mary
eyes
met
mine
and
in
the
indifferent
light
of
the
french
i
could
see
excitement
in
them
i
knew
it
was
excitement
not
fear
she
had
never
heard
the
noise
of
a
great
barrage
before
blenkiron
was
restless
and
peter
was
sunk
in
his
own
thoughts
i
was
growing
very
depressed
for
in
a
little
i
would
have
to
part
from
my
best
friends
and
the
girl
i
loved
but
with
the
depression
was
mixed
an
odd
expectation
which
was
almost
pleasant
the
guns
had
brought
back
my
profession
to
me
i
was
moving
towards
their
thunder
and
god
only
knew
the
end
of
it
the
happy
dream
i
had
dreamed
of
the
cotswolds
and
a
home
with
mary
beside
me
seemed
suddenly
to
have
fallen
away
to
an
infinite
distance
i
felt
once
again
that
i
was
on
the
of
life
the
last
part
of
the
journey
i
was
casting
back
to
rake
up
my
knowledge
of
the
countryside
i
saw
again
the
stricken
belt
from
serre
to
combles
where
we
had
fought
in
the
summer
of
i
had
not
been
present
in
the
advance
of
the
following
spring
but
i
had
been
at
cambrai
and
i
knew
all
the
down
country
from
lagnicourt
to
st
quentin
i
shut
my
eyes
and
tried
to
picture
it
and
to
see
the
roads
running
up
to
the
line
and
wondered
just
at
what
points
the
big
pressure
had
come
they
had
told
me
in
paris
that
the
british
were
as
far
south
as
the
oise
so
the
bombardment
we
had
heard
must
be
directed
to
our
address
with
passchendaele
and
cambrai
in
my
mind
and
some
notion
of
the
difficulties
we
had
always
had
in
getting
drafts
i
was
puzzled
to
think
where
we
could
have
found
the
troops
to
man
the
new
front
we
must
be
unholily
thin
on
that
long
line
and
against
that
awesome
bombardment
and
the
masses
and
the
new
tactics
that
ivery
had
bragged
of
when
we
ran
into
the
dingy
cavern
which
is
amiens
station
i
seemed
to
note
a
new
excitement
i
felt
it
in
the
air
rather
than
deduced
it
from
any
special
incident
except
that
the
platform
was
very
crowded
with
civilians
most
of
them
with
an
extra
amount
of
baggage
i
wondered
if
the
place
had
been
bombed
the
night
before
wo
say
goodbye
yet
i
told
the
others
train
does
leave
for
half
an
hour
i
off
to
try
and
get
news
accompanied
by
archie
i
hunted
out
an
of
my
acquaintance
to
my
questions
he
responded
cheerfully
we
doing
famously
sir
i
heard
this
afternoon
from
a
man
in
operations
that
was
perfectly
satisfied
we
killed
a
lot
of
huns
and
only
lost
a
few
kilometres
of
ground
you
going
to
your
division
well
it
up
peronne
way
or
was
last
night
cheyne
and
dunthorpe
came
back
from
leave
and
tried
to
steal
a
car
to
get
up
to
it
oh
i
having
the
deuce
of
a
time
these
blighted
civilians
have
got
the
wind
up
and
a
lot
are
trying
to
clear
out
the
idiots
say
the
huns
will
be
in
amiens
in
a
week
what
the
phrase
que
les
civils
i
must
push
on
sir
i
sent
archie
back
with
these
scraps
of
news
and
was
about
to
make
a
rush
for
the
house
of
one
of
the
press
officers
who
would
i
thought
be
in
the
way
of
knowing
things
when
at
the
station
entrance
i
ran
across
laidlaw
he
had
been
in
the
corps
to
which
my
old
brigade
belonged
and
was
now
on
the
staff
of
some
army
he
was
striding
towards
a
car
when
i
grabbed
his
arm
and
he
turned
on
me
a
very
sick
face
lord
hannay
where
did
you
spring
from
the
news
you
say
he
sank
his
voice
and
drew
me
into
a
quiet
corner
news
is
hellish
told
me
we
were
holding
i
observed
be
damned
the
boche
is
clean
through
on
a
broad
front
he
broke
us
today
at
maissemy
and
essigny
yes
the
flinging
in
division
after
division
like
the
blows
of
a
hammer
what
else
could
you
expect
and
he
clutched
my
arm
fiercely
in
name
could
eleven
divisions
hold
a
front
of
forty
miles
and
against
four
to
one
in
numbers
it
is
war
it
naked
lunacy
i
knew
the
worst
now
and
it
did
shock
me
for
i
had
known
it
was
coming
laidlaw
nerves
were
pretty
bad
for
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
bright
like
a
man
with
a
fever
and
he
laughed
bitterly
have
three
infantry
divisions
and
two
cavalry
they
into
the
mill
long
ago
the
french
are
coming
up
on
our
right
but
they
the
devil
of
a
way
to
go
that
what
down
here
about
and
we
getting
help
from
horne
and
plumer
but
all
that
takes
days
and
meantime
we
walking
back
like
we
did
at
mons
and
at
this
time
of
day
too
oh
yes
the
whole
line
retreating
parts
of
it
were
pretty
comfortable
but
they
had
to
get
back
or
be
put
in
the
bag
i
wish
to
heaven
i
knew
where
our
right
divisions
have
got
to
for
all
i
know
they
at
compiegne
by
now
the
boche
was
over
the
canal
this
morning
and
by
this
time
most
likely
he
across
the
somme
at
that
i
exclaimed
mean
to
tell
me
we
going
to
lose
peronne
he
cried
be
lucky
not
to
lose
amiens
and
on
the
top
of
it
all
i
got
some
kind
of
blasted
fever
i
be
raving
in
an
hour
he
was
rushing
off
but
i
held
him
about
my
old
lot
i
asked
damned
good
but
they
shot
all
to
bits
every
division
did
well
it
a
marvel
they
were
all
scuppered
and
it
be
a
flaming
miracle
if
they
find
a
line
they
can
stand
on
westwater
got
a
leg
smashed
he
was
brought
down
this
evening
and
you
find
him
in
the
hospital
fraser
killed
and
lefroy
a
prisoner
at
least
that
was
my
last
news
i
do
know
who
got
the
brigades
but
carrying
on
with
the
division
you
better
get
up
the
line
as
fast
as
you
can
and
take
over
from
him
see
the
army
commander
he
be
in
amiens
tomorrow
morning
for
a
laidlaw
lay
wearily
back
in
his
car
and
disappeared
into
the
night
while
i
hurried
to
the
train
the
others
had
descended
to
the
platform
and
were
grouped
round
archie
who
was
discoursing
optimistic
nonsense
i
got
them
into
the
carriage
and
shut
the
door
pretty
bad
i
said
front
pierced
in
several
places
and
we
back
to
the
upper
somme
i
afraid
it
is
going
to
stop
there
i
off
up
the
line
as
soon
as
i
can
get
my
orders
wake
you
come
with
me
for
every
man
will
be
wanted
blenkiron
you
see
mary
and
peter
safe
to
england
we
just
in
time
for
tomorrow
it
might
be
easy
to
get
out
of
amiens
i
can
see
yet
the
anxious
faces
in
that
compartment
we
said
goodbye
after
the
british
style
without
much
i
remember
that
old
peter
gripped
my
hand
as
if
he
would
never
release
it
and
that
face
had
grown
very
pale
if
i
delayed
another
second
i
should
have
howled
for
mary
lips
were
trembling
and
peter
had
eyes
like
a
wounded
stag
bless
you
i
said
hoarsely
and
as
i
went
off
i
heard
peter
voice
a
little
cracked
saying
bless
you
my
old
friend
i
spent
some
weary
hours
looking
for
westwater
he
was
not
in
the
big
clearing
station
but
i
ran
him
to
earth
at
last
in
the
new
hospital
which
had
just
been
got
going
in
the
ursuline
convent
he
was
the
most
sterling
little
man
in
ordinary
life
rather
dry
and
dogmatic
with
a
trick
of
taking
you
up
sharply
which
did
make
him
popular
now
he
was
lying
very
stiff
and
quiet
in
the
hospital
bed
and
his
blue
eyes
were
solemn
and
pathetic
like
a
sick
dog
nothing
much
wrong
with
me
he
said
in
reply
to
my
question
shell
dropped
beside
me
and
damaged
my
foot
they
say
they
have
to
cut
it
off
i
an
easier
mind
now
you
here
hannay
of
course
you
take
over
from
masterton
he
a
good
man
but
not
quite
up
to
his
job
poor
fraser
you
heard
about
fraser
he
was
done
in
at
the
very
start
yes
a
shell
and
lefroy
if
he
alive
and
not
too
badly
smashed
the
hun
has
got
a
troublesome
prisoner
he
was
too
sick
to
talk
but
he
would
let
me
go
division
was
all
right
do
you
believe
anyone
who
says
we
did
fight
like
heroes
our
outpost
line
held
up
the
hun
for
six
hours
and
only
about
a
dozen
men
came
back
we
could
have
stuck
it
out
in
the
if
both
flanks
had
been
turned
they
got
through
crabbe
left
and
came
down
the
verey
ravine
and
a
big
wave
rushed
shropshire
wood
we
fought
it
out
yard
by
yard
and
did
budge
till
we
saw
the
plessis
dump
blazing
in
our
rear
then
it
was
about
time
to
go
we
have
many
battalion
commanders
left
watson
endicot
crawshay
he
stammered
out
a
list
of
gallant
fellows
who
had
gone
back
double
quick
hannay
they
want
you
i
not
happy
about
masterton
he
too
young
for
the
job
and
then
a
nurse
drove
me
out
and
i
left
him
speaking
in
the
strange
forced
voice
of
great
weakness
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
stood
mary
saw
you
go
in
she
said
i
waited
for
you
my
dear
i
cried
should
have
been
in
boulogne
by
now
what
madness
brought
you
here
know
me
here
and
they
taken
me
on
you
could
expect
me
to
stay
behind
you
said
yourself
everybody
was
wanted
and
i
in
a
service
like
you
please
do
be
angry
dick
i
was
angry
i
was
even
extra
anxious
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
have
been
planned
by
fate
since
the
creation
of
the
world
the
game
we
had
been
engaged
in
was
finished
and
it
was
right
that
we
should
play
it
out
together
with
that
feeling
came
a
conviction
too
of
ultimate
victory
somehow
or
sometime
we
should
get
to
the
end
of
our
pilgrimage
but
i
remembered
mary
forebodings
about
the
sacrifice
required
the
best
of
us
that
ruled
me
out
but
what
about
her
i
caught
her
to
my
arms
my
very
dearest
do
worry
about
me
for
mine
a
soft
job
and
i
can
look
after
my
skin
but
oh
take
care
of
yourself
for
you
are
all
the
world
to
me
she
kissed
me
gravely
like
a
wise
child
am
not
afraid
for
you
she
said
are
going
to
stand
in
the
breach
and
i
know
i
know
you
will
win
remember
that
there
is
someone
here
whose
heart
is
so
full
of
pride
of
her
man
that
it
has
room
for
fear
as
i
went
out
of
the
convent
door
i
felt
that
once
again
i
had
been
given
my
orders
it
did
not
surprise
me
that
when
i
sought
out
my
room
on
an
upper
floor
of
the
hotel
de
france
i
found
blenkiron
in
the
corridor
he
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
ca
keep
me
out
of
the
show
dick
he
said
you
start
arguing
why
this
is
the
one
original
chance
of
a
lifetime
for
john
blenkiron
our
little
fight
at
erzerum
was
only
a
but
this
is
a
real
armageddon
i
guess
i
find
a
way
to
make
myself
useful
i
had
no
doubt
he
would
and
i
was
glad
he
had
stayed
behind
but
i
felt
it
was
hard
on
peter
to
have
the
job
of
returning
to
england
alone
at
such
a
time
like
useless
flotsam
washed
up
by
a
flood
need
worry
said
blenkiron
not
making
england
this
trip
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
has
beat
it
out
of
this
township
by
the
eastern
postern
he
had
some
talk
with
sir
archibald
roylance
and
presently
other
gentlemen
of
the
royal
flying
corps
appeared
and
the
upshot
was
that
sir
archibald
hitched
on
to
peter
grip
and
departed
without
saying
farewell
my
notion
is
that
he
gone
to
have
a
few
words
with
his
old
friends
at
some
flying
station
or
he
might
have
the
idea
of
going
back
to
england
by
aeroplane
and
so
having
one
last
flutter
before
he
folds
his
wings
anyhow
peter
looked
a
mighty
happy
man
the
last
i
saw
he
was
smoking
his
pipe
with
a
batch
of
young
lads
in
a
flying
corps
waggon
and
heading
straight
for
germany
chapter
how
an
exile
returned
to
his
own
people
next
morning
i
found
the
army
commander
on
his
way
to
doullens
over
the
division
he
said
i
afraid
there
much
left
of
it
i
tell
carr
to
get
through
to
the
corps
headquarters
when
he
can
find
them
you
have
to
nurse
the
remnants
for
they
ca
be
pulled
out
yet
not
for
a
day
or
two
bless
me
hannay
there
are
parts
of
our
line
which
we
holding
with
a
man
and
a
boy
you
got
to
stick
it
out
till
the
french
take
over
we
not
hanging
on
by
our
eyelids
it
our
eyelashes
now
about
positions
to
fall
back
on
sir
i
asked
doing
our
best
but
we
have
enough
men
to
prepare
them
he
plucked
open
a
map
we
digging
a
line
and
there
if
we
can
hold
that
bit
for
two
days
we
shall
have
a
fair
line
resting
on
the
river
but
we
may
have
time
then
i
told
him
about
blenkiron
whom
of
course
he
had
heard
of
was
one
of
the
biggest
engineers
in
the
states
and
he
got
a
nailing
fine
eye
for
country
he
make
good
somehow
if
you
let
him
help
in
the
job
very
fellow
he
said
and
he
wrote
an
order
this
to
jacks
and
he
fix
up
a
temporary
commission
your
man
can
find
a
uniform
somewhere
in
amiens
after
that
i
went
to
the
detail
camp
and
found
that
ivery
had
duly
arrived
prisoner
has
given
no
trouble
sirr
hamilton
reported
a
wee
thing
peevish
they
saying
that
the
gairmans
is
gettin
on
fine
and
i
was
tellin
him
that
he
should
be
proud
of
his
ain
folk
but
he
was
verra
weel
pleased
three
days
had
wrought
a
transformation
in
ivery
that
face
once
so
cool
and
capable
was
now
sharpened
like
a
hunted
beast
his
imagination
was
preying
on
him
and
i
could
picture
its
torture
he
who
had
been
always
at
the
top
directing
the
machine
was
now
only
a
cog
in
it
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
anything
but
powerful
now
he
was
impotent
he
was
in
a
hard
unfamiliar
world
in
the
grip
of
something
which
he
feared
and
did
understand
in
the
charge
of
men
who
were
in
no
way
amenable
to
his
persuasiveness
it
was
like
a
proud
and
bullying
manager
suddenly
forced
to
labour
in
a
squad
of
navvies
and
worse
for
there
was
the
gnawing
physical
fear
of
what
was
coming
he
made
an
appeal
to
me
the
english
torture
their
prisoners
he
asked
have
beaten
me
i
own
it
and
i
plead
for
mercy
i
will
go
on
my
knees
if
you
like
i
am
not
afraid
of
death
in
my
own
way
people
are
afraid
of
death
in
their
own
way
do
you
degrade
me
i
am
a
gentleman
as
we
define
the
thing
i
said
his
jaw
dropped
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
he
quavered
have
been
a
soldier
i
said
are
going
to
see
a
little
fighting
from
the
ranks
there
will
be
no
brutality
you
will
be
armed
if
you
want
to
defend
yourself
you
will
have
the
same
chance
of
survival
as
the
men
around
you
you
may
have
heard
that
your
countrymen
are
doing
well
it
is
even
possible
that
they
may
win
the
battle
what
was
your
forecast
to
me
amiens
in
two
days
abbeville
in
three
well
you
are
a
little
behind
scheduled
time
but
still
you
are
prospering
you
told
me
that
you
were
the
chief
architect
of
all
this
and
you
are
going
to
be
given
the
chance
of
seeing
it
perhaps
of
sharing
in
it
from
the
other
side
does
it
not
appeal
to
your
sense
of
justice
he
groaned
and
turned
away
i
had
no
more
pity
for
him
than
i
would
have
had
for
a
black
mamba
that
had
killed
my
friend
and
was
now
caught
to
a
cleft
tree
nor
oddly
enough
had
wake
if
we
had
shot
ivery
outright
at
st
anton
i
am
certain
that
wake
would
have
called
us
murderers
now
he
was
in
complete
agreement
his
passionate
hatred
of
war
made
him
rejoice
that
a
chief
contriver
of
war
should
be
made
to
share
in
its
terrors
tried
to
talk
me
over
this
morning
he
told
me
he
was
on
my
side
and
said
the
kind
of
thing
i
used
to
say
last
year
it
made
me
rather
ashamed
of
some
of
my
past
performances
to
hear
that
scoundrel
imitating
them
by
the
way
hannay
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
coming
on
my
staff
you
a
stout
fellow
and
i
ca
do
without
you
i
wo
fight
wo
be
asked
to
we
trying
to
stem
the
tide
which
wants
to
roll
to
the
sea
you
know
how
the
boche
behaves
in
occupied
country
and
mary
in
amiens
at
that
news
he
shut
his
lips
he
began
i
said
do
ask
you
to
forfeit
one
of
your
blessed
principles
you
need
fire
a
shot
but
i
want
a
man
to
carry
orders
for
me
for
we
have
a
line
any
more
only
a
lot
of
blobs
like
quicksilver
i
want
a
clever
man
for
the
job
and
a
brave
one
and
i
know
that
you
not
afraid
he
said
do
think
i
am
much
well
i
content
i
started
blenkiron
off
in
a
car
for
corps
headquarters
and
in
the
afternoon
took
the
road
myself
i
knew
every
inch
of
the
country
the
lift
of
the
hill
east
of
amiens
the
roman
highway
that
ran
straight
as
an
arrow
to
st
quentin
the
marshy
lagoons
of
the
somme
and
that
broad
strip
of
land
wasted
by
battle
between
dompierre
and
peronne
i
had
come
to
amiens
through
it
in
january
for
i
had
been
up
to
the
line
before
i
left
for
paris
and
then
it
had
been
a
peaceful
place
with
peasants
tilling
their
fields
and
new
buildings
going
up
on
the
old
and
carpenters
busy
at
cottage
roofs
and
scarcely
a
transport
waggon
on
the
road
to
remind
one
of
war
now
the
main
route
was
choked
like
the
albert
road
when
the
somme
battle
first
began
troops
going
up
and
troops
coming
down
the
latter
in
the
last
stage
of
weariness
a
ceaseless
traffic
of
ambulances
one
way
and
ammunition
waggons
the
other
busy
staff
cars
trying
to
worm
a
way
through
the
mass
strings
of
gun
horses
oddments
of
cavalry
and
here
and
there
blue
french
uniforms
all
that
i
had
seen
before
but
one
thing
was
new
to
me
little
country
carts
with
women
and
mystified
children
in
them
and
piles
of
household
plenishing
were
creeping
westward
or
stood
waiting
at
village
doors
beside
these
tramped
old
men
and
boys
mostly
in
their
sunday
best
as
if
they
were
going
to
church
i
had
never
seen
the
sight
before
for
i
had
never
seen
the
british
army
falling
back
the
dam
which
held
up
the
waters
had
broken
and
the
dwellers
in
the
valley
were
trying
to
save
their
pitiful
little
treasures
and
over
everything
horse
and
man
cart
and
wheelbarrow
road
and
tillage
lay
the
white
march
dust
the
sky
was
blue
as
june
small
birds
were
busy
in
the
copses
and
in
the
corners
of
abandoned
gardens
i
had
a
glimpse
of
the
first
violets
presently
as
we
topped
a
rise
we
came
within
full
noise
of
the
guns
that
too
was
new
to
me
for
it
was
no
ordinary
bombardment
there
was
a
special
quality
in
the
sound
something
ragged
straggling
intermittent
which
i
had
never
heard
before
it
was
the
sign
of
open
warfare
and
a
moving
battle
at
peronne
from
which
the
newly
returned
inhabitants
had
a
second
time
fled
the
battle
seemed
to
be
at
the
doors
there
i
had
news
of
my
division
it
was
farther
south
towards
st
christ
we
groped
our
way
among
bad
roads
to
where
its
headquarters
were
believed
to
be
while
the
voice
of
the
guns
grew
louder
they
turned
out
to
be
those
of
another
division
which
was
busy
getting
ready
to
cross
the
river
then
the
dark
fell
and
while
airplanes
flew
west
into
the
sunset
there
was
a
redder
sunset
in
the
east
where
the
unceasing
flashes
of
gunfire
were
pale
against
the
angry
glow
of
burning
dumps
the
sight
of
the
of
a
scots
fusilier
made
me
halt
and
the
man
turned
out
to
belong
to
my
division
half
an
hour
later
i
was
taking
over
from
the
masterton
in
the
ruins
of
what
had
once
been
a
factory
there
to
my
surprise
i
found
lefroy
the
boche
had
held
him
prisoner
for
precisely
eight
hours
during
that
time
he
had
been
so
interested
in
watching
the
way
the
enemy
handled
an
attack
that
he
had
forgotten
the
miseries
of
his
position
he
described
with
blasphemous
admiration
the
endless
wheel
by
which
supplies
and
reserve
troops
move
up
the
silence
the
smoothness
the
perfect
discipline
then
he
had
realized
that
he
was
a
captive
and
unwounded
and
had
gone
mad
being
a
boxer
of
note
he
had
sent
his
two
guards
spinning
into
a
ditch
dodged
the
ensuing
shots
and
found
shelter
in
the
lee
of
a
blazing
ammunition
dump
where
his
pursuers
hesitated
to
follow
then
he
had
spent
an
anxious
hour
trying
to
get
through
an
outpost
line
which
he
thought
was
boche
only
by
overhearing
an
exchange
of
oaths
in
the
accents
of
dundee
did
he
realize
that
it
was
our
own
it
was
a
comfort
to
have
lefroy
back
for
he
was
both
and
resourceful
but
i
found
that
i
had
a
division
only
on
paper
it
was
about
the
strength
of
a
brigade
the
brigades
battalions
and
the
battalions
companies
this
is
not
the
place
to
write
the
story
of
the
week
that
followed
i
could
not
write
it
even
if
i
wanted
to
for
i
do
know
it
there
was
a
plan
somewhere
which
you
will
find
in
the
history
books
but
with
me
it
was
blank
chaos
orders
came
but
long
before
they
arrived
the
situation
had
changed
and
i
could
no
more
obey
them
than
fly
to
the
moon
often
i
had
lost
touch
with
the
divisions
on
both
flanks
intelligence
arrived
erratically
out
of
the
void
and
for
the
most
part
we
worried
along
without
it
i
heard
we
were
under
the
french
first
it
was
said
to
be
foch
and
then
fayolle
whom
i
had
met
in
paris
but
the
higher
command
seemed
a
million
miles
away
and
we
were
left
to
use
our
mother
wits
my
problem
was
to
give
ground
as
slowly
as
possible
and
at
the
same
time
not
to
delay
too
long
for
retreat
we
must
with
the
boche
sending
in
divisions
each
morning
it
was
a
kind
of
war
worlds
distant
from
the
old
trench
battles
and
since
i
had
been
taught
no
other
i
had
to
invent
rules
as
i
went
along
looking
back
it
seems
a
miracle
that
any
of
us
came
out
of
it
only
the
grace
of
god
and
the
uncommon
toughness
of
the
british
soldier
bluffed
the
hun
and
prevented
him
pouring
through
the
breach
to
abbeville
and
the
sea
we
were
no
better
than
a
mosquito
curtain
stuck
in
a
doorway
to
stop
the
advance
of
an
angry
bull
the
army
commander
was
right
we
were
hanging
on
with
our
eyelashes
we
must
have
been
easily
the
weakest
part
of
the
whole
front
for
we
were
holding
a
line
which
was
never
less
than
two
miles
and
was
often
as
i
judged
nearer
five
and
there
was
nothing
in
reserve
to
us
except
some
oddments
of
cavalry
who
chased
about
the
whole
under
vague
orders
mercifully
for
us
the
boche
blundered
perhaps
he
did
not
know
our
condition
for
our
airmen
were
magnificent
and
you
never
saw
a
boche
plane
over
our
line
by
day
though
they
bombed
us
merrily
by
night
if
he
had
called
our
bluff
we
should
have
been
done
but
he
put
his
main
strength
to
the
north
and
the
south
of
us
north
he
pressed
hard
on
the
third
army
but
he
got
well
hammered
by
the
guards
north
of
bapaume
and
he
could
make
no
headway
at
arras
south
he
drove
at
the
paris
railway
and
down
the
oise
valley
but
there
petain
reserves
had
arrived
and
the
french
made
a
noble
stand
not
that
he
did
fight
hard
in
the
centre
where
we
were
but
he
had
his
best
troops
and
after
we
got
west
of
the
bend
of
the
somme
he
was
outrunning
his
heavy
guns
still
it
was
a
desperate
enough
business
for
our
flanks
were
all
the
time
falling
back
and
we
had
to
conform
to
movements
we
could
only
guess
at
after
all
we
were
on
the
direct
route
to
amiens
and
it
was
up
to
us
to
yield
slowly
so
as
to
give
haig
and
petain
time
to
get
up
supports
i
was
a
miser
about
every
yard
of
ground
for
every
yard
and
every
minute
were
precious
we
alone
stood
between
the
enemy
and
the
city
and
in
the
city
was
mary
if
you
ask
me
about
our
plans
i
ca
tell
you
i
had
a
new
one
every
hour
i
got
instructions
from
the
corps
but
as
i
have
said
they
were
usually
out
of
date
before
they
arrived
and
most
of
my
tactics
i
had
to
invent
myself
i
had
a
plain
task
and
to
fulfil
it
i
had
to
use
what
methods
the
almighty
allowed
me
i
hardly
slept
i
ate
little
i
was
on
the
move
day
and
night
but
i
never
felt
so
strong
in
my
life
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
tire
and
oddly
enough
i
was
happy
if
a
man
whole
being
is
focused
on
one
aim
he
has
no
time
to
worry
i
remember
we
were
all
very
gentle
and
those
days
lefroy
whose
tongue
was
famous
for
its
edge
now
cooed
like
a
dove
the
troops
were
on
their
uppers
but
as
steady
as
rocks
we
were
against
the
end
of
the
world
and
that
stiffens
a
man
day
after
day
saw
the
same
performance
i
held
my
wavering
front
with
an
outpost
line
which
delayed
each
new
attack
till
i
could
take
its
bearings
i
had
special
companies
for
at
selected
points
when
i
wanted
time
to
retire
the
rest
of
the
division
i
think
we
must
have
fought
more
than
a
dozen
of
such
little
battles
we
lost
men
all
the
time
but
the
enemy
made
no
big
scoop
though
he
was
always
on
the
edge
of
one
looking
back
it
seems
like
a
succession
of
miracles
often
i
was
in
one
end
of
a
village
when
the
boche
was
in
the
other
our
batteries
were
always
on
the
move
and
the
work
of
the
gunners
was
past
praising
sometimes
we
faced
east
sometimes
north
and
once
at
a
most
critical
moment
due
south
for
our
front
waved
and
blew
like
a
flag
at
a
masthead
thank
god
the
enemy
was
getting
away
from
his
big
engine
and
his
ordinary
troops
were
fagged
and
poor
in
quality
it
was
when
his
fresh
shock
battalions
came
on
that
i
held
my
breath
he
had
a
heathenish
amount
of
and
he
used
them
beautifully
oh
i
take
my
hat
off
to
the
boche
performance
he
was
doing
what
we
had
tried
to
do
at
the
somme
and
the
aisne
and
arras
and
ypres
and
he
was
more
or
less
succeeding
and
the
reason
was
that
he
was
going
for
victory
the
men
as
i
have
said
were
wonderfully
steady
and
patient
under
the
fiercest
trial
that
soldiers
can
endure
i
had
all
kinds
in
the
division
old
army
new
army
territorials
and
you
could
pick
and
choose
between
them
they
fought
like
trojans
and
dirty
weary
and
hungry
found
still
some
salt
of
humour
in
their
sufferings
it
was
a
proof
of
the
sanity
of
human
nature
but
we
had
one
man
with
us
who
was
hardly
sane
in
the
hustle
of
those
days
i
now
and
then
caught
sight
of
ivery
i
had
to
be
everywhere
at
all
hours
and
often
visited
that
remnant
of
scots
fusiliers
into
which
the
subtlest
brain
in
europe
had
been
drafted
he
and
his
keepers
were
never
on
outpost
duty
or
in
any
they
were
part
of
the
mass
whose
only
business
was
to
retire
discreetly
this
was
child
play
to
hamilton
who
had
been
out
since
mons
and
amos
after
taking
a
day
to
get
used
to
it
wrapped
himself
in
his
grim
philosophy
and
rather
enjoyed
it
you
could
surprise
amos
any
more
than
a
turk
but
the
man
with
them
whom
they
never
left
that
was
another
matter
the
first
wee
bit
hamilton
reported
thocht
he
was
gaun
daft
every
shell
that
came
near
he
jumped
like
a
young
horse
and
the
gas
we
had
to
tie
on
his
mask
for
him
for
his
hands
were
fushionless
there
was
whiles
when
he
wadna
be
hindered
from
standin
up
and
to
hisself
though
the
bullets
was
spittin
he
was
what
ye
call
demoralized
syne
he
got
as
though
he
didna
hear
or
see
onything
he
did
what
we
him
and
when
we
let
him
be
he
sat
down
and
grat
he
aye
greetin
queer
thing
sirr
but
the
gairmans
canna
hit
him
i
aye
shakin
bullets
out
o
my
claes
and
i
got
a
hole
in
my
shoulder
and
andra
took
a
bash
on
his
tin
that
wad
hae
felled
onybody
that
hadna
a
heid
like
a
stot
but
sirr
the
prisoner
taks
no
scaith
our
boys
are
feared
of
him
there
was
an
irishman
says
to
me
that
he
had
the
evil
eye
and
ye
can
see
for
yerself
that
he
no
canny
i
saw
that
his
skin
had
become
like
parchment
and
that
his
eyes
were
glassy
i
do
think
he
recognized
me
he
take
his
meals
i
asked
doesna
eat
muckle
but
he
has
an
unco
thirst
ye
canna
keep
him
off
the
men
he
was
learning
very
fast
the
meaning
of
that
war
he
had
so
confidently
played
with
i
believe
i
am
a
merciful
man
but
as
i
looked
at
him
i
felt
no
vestige
of
pity
he
was
dreeing
the
weird
he
had
prepared
for
others
i
thought
of
scudder
of
the
thousand
friends
i
had
lost
of
the
great
seas
of
blood
and
the
mountains
of
sorrow
this
man
and
his
like
had
made
for
the
world
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
could
see
the
long
ridges
above
combles
and
longueval
which
the
salt
of
the
earth
had
fallen
to
win
and
which
were
again
under
the
hoof
of
the
boche
i
thought
of
the
distracted
city
behind
us
and
what
it
meant
to
me
and
the
weak
the
pitifully
weak
screen
which
was
all
its
defence
i
thought
of
the
foul
deeds
which
had
made
the
german
name
to
stink
by
land
and
sea
foulness
of
which
he
was
the
and
then
i
was
amazed
at
our
forbearance
he
would
go
mad
and
madness
for
him
was
more
decent
than
sanity
i
had
another
man
who
was
what
you
might
call
normal
and
that
was
wake
he
was
the
opposite
of
if
you
understand
me
he
had
never
been
properly
under
fire
before
but
he
did
give
a
straw
for
it
i
had
known
the
same
thing
with
other
men
and
they
generally
ended
by
crumpling
up
for
it
is
natural
that
five
or
six
feet
of
human
flesh
should
be
afraid
of
what
can
torture
and
destroy
it
the
natural
thing
is
to
be
always
a
little
scared
like
me
but
by
an
effort
of
the
will
and
attention
to
work
to
contrive
to
forget
it
but
wake
apparently
never
gave
it
a
thought
he
was
foolhardy
only
indifferent
he
used
to
go
about
with
a
smile
on
his
face
a
smile
of
contentment
even
the
horrors
and
we
had
plenty
of
them
did
affect
him
his
eyes
which
used
to
be
hot
had
now
a
curious
open
innocence
like
peter
i
would
have
been
happier
if
he
had
been
a
little
rattled
one
night
after
we
had
had
a
bad
day
of
anxiety
i
talked
to
him
as
we
smoked
in
what
had
once
been
a
french
he
was
an
extra
right
arm
to
me
and
i
told
him
so
must
be
a
queer
experience
for
you
i
said
he
replied
is
very
wonderful
i
did
not
think
a
man
could
go
through
it
and
keep
his
reason
but
i
know
many
things
i
did
not
know
before
i
know
that
the
soul
can
be
reborn
without
leaving
the
body
i
stared
at
him
and
he
went
on
without
looking
at
me
not
a
classical
scholar
hannay
there
was
a
strange
cult
in
the
ancient
world
the
worship
of
magna
mater
the
great
mother
to
enter
into
her
mysteries
the
votary
passed
through
a
bath
of
blood
i
think
i
am
passing
through
that
bath
i
think
that
like
the
initiate
i
shall
be
in
reborn
into
the
eternal
i
advised
him
to
have
a
drink
for
that
talk
frightened
me
it
looked
as
if
he
were
becoming
what
the
scots
call
lefroy
noticed
the
same
thing
and
was
always
speaking
about
it
he
was
as
brave
as
a
bull
himself
and
with
very
much
the
same
kind
of
courage
but
gallantry
perturbed
him
ca
make
the
chap
out
he
told
me
behaves
as
if
his
mind
was
too
full
of
better
things
to
give
a
damn
for
boche
guns
he
does
take
foolish
risks
i
do
mean
that
but
he
behaves
as
if
risks
did
signify
it
positively
eerie
to
see
him
making
notes
with
a
steady
hand
when
shells
are
dropping
like
hailstones
and
we
all
thinking
every
minute
our
last
you
got
to
be
careful
with
him
sir
he
a
long
sight
too
valuable
for
us
to
spare
lefroy
was
right
about
that
for
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
him
the
worst
part
of
our
job
was
to
keep
touch
with
our
flanks
and
that
was
what
i
used
wake
for
he
covered
country
like
a
sometimes
on
a
rusty
bicycle
oftener
on
foot
and
you
could
tire
him
i
wonder
what
other
divisions
thought
of
the
grimy
private
who
was
our
chief
means
of
communication
he
knew
nothing
of
military
affairs
before
but
he
got
the
hang
of
this
fighting
as
if
he
had
been
born
for
it
he
never
fired
a
shot
he
carried
no
arms
the
only
weapons
he
used
were
his
brains
and
they
were
the
best
conceivable
i
never
met
a
staff
officer
who
was
so
quick
at
getting
a
point
or
at
sizing
up
a
situation
he
had
put
his
back
into
the
business
and
talent
is
not
common
anywhere
one
day
a
from
a
neighbouring
division
came
to
see
me
on
earth
did
you
pick
up
that
man
wake
he
asked
a
conscientious
objector
and
a
i
said
i
wish
to
heaven
we
had
a
few
more
conscientious
objectors
in
this
show
he
the
only
fellow
who
seems
to
know
anything
about
this
blessed
battle
my
general
sending
you
a
chit
about
him
need
i
said
laughing
know
his
value
he
an
old
friend
of
mine
i
used
wake
as
my
link
with
corps
headquarters
and
especially
with
blenkiron
for
about
the
sixth
day
of
the
show
i
was
beginning
to
get
rather
desperate
this
kind
of
thing
could
go
on
for
ever
we
were
miles
back
now
behind
the
old
line
of
and
as
we
rested
one
flank
on
the
river
the
immediate
situation
was
a
little
easier
but
i
had
lost
a
lot
of
men
and
those
that
were
left
were
blind
with
fatigue
the
big
bulges
of
the
enemy
to
north
and
south
had
added
to
the
length
of
the
total
front
and
i
found
i
had
to
fan
out
my
thin
ranks
the
boche
was
still
pressing
on
though
his
impetus
was
slacker
if
he
knew
how
little
there
was
to
stop
him
in
my
section
he
might
make
a
push
which
would
carry
him
to
amiens
only
the
magnificent
work
of
our
airmen
had
prevented
him
getting
that
knowledge
but
we
could
keep
the
secrecy
up
for
ever
some
day
an
enemy
plane
would
get
over
and
it
only
needed
the
drive
of
a
fresh
or
two
to
scatter
us
i
wanted
a
good
prepared
position
with
sound
trenches
and
decent
wiring
above
all
i
wanted
reserves
reserves
the
word
was
on
my
lips
all
day
and
it
haunted
my
dreams
i
was
told
that
the
french
were
to
relieve
us
but
when
when
my
reports
to
corps
headquarters
were
one
long
wail
for
more
troops
i
knew
there
was
a
position
prepared
behind
us
but
i
needed
men
to
hold
it
wake
brought
in
a
message
from
blenkiron
waiting
for
you
dick
he
wrote
we
gotten
quite
a
nice
little
home
ready
for
you
this
old
man
has
hustled
so
hard
since
he
struck
copper
in
montana
in
we
dug
three
lines
of
trenches
and
made
a
heap
of
pretty
redoubts
and
i
guess
they
well
laid
out
for
the
army
staff
has
supervised
them
and
they
no
slouches
at
this
brand
of
engineering
you
would
have
laughed
to
see
the
labour
we
employed
we
had
all
breeds
of
dago
and
chinaman
and
some
of
your
own
south
african
blacks
and
they
got
so
busy
on
the
job
they
forgot
about
bedtime
i
used
to
be
reckoned
a
bit
of
a
slave
driver
but
my
special
talents
were
needed
with
this
push
i
going
to
put
a
lot
of
money
into
foreign
missions
henceforward
i
wrote
back
trenches
are
no
good
without
men
for
god
sake
get
something
that
can
hold
a
rifle
my
lot
are
done
to
the
world
then
i
left
lefroy
with
the
division
and
went
down
on
the
back
of
an
ambulance
to
see
for
myself
i
found
blenkiron
some
of
the
army
engineers
and
a
staff
officer
from
corps
headquarters
and
i
found
archie
roylance
they
had
dug
a
mighty
good
line
and
wired
it
nobly
it
ran
from
the
river
to
the
wood
of
la
bruyere
on
the
little
hill
above
the
ablain
stream
it
was
desperately
long
but
i
saw
at
once
it
could
well
be
shorter
for
the
division
on
the
south
of
us
had
its
hands
full
with
the
fringe
of
the
big
thrust
against
the
french
no
good
blinking
the
facts
i
told
them
have
a
thousand
men
and
what
i
have
are
at
the
end
of
their
tether
if
you
put
in
these
trenches
they
go
to
sleep
on
their
feet
when
can
the
french
take
over
i
was
told
that
it
had
been
arranged
for
next
morning
but
that
it
had
now
been
put
off
hours
it
was
only
a
temporary
measure
pending
the
arrival
of
british
divisions
from
the
north
archie
looked
grave
boche
is
pushin
up
new
troops
in
this
sector
we
got
the
news
before
i
left
squadron
headquarters
it
looks
as
if
it
would
be
a
near
thing
sir
wo
be
a
near
thing
it
an
absolute
black
certainty
my
fellows
ca
carry
on
as
they
are
another
day
great
god
they
had
a
fortnight
in
hell
find
me
more
men
or
we
buckle
up
at
the
next
push
my
temper
was
coming
very
near
its
limits
raked
the
country
with
a
comb
sir
said
one
of
the
staff
officers
we
raised
a
scratch
pack
best
part
of
two
thousand
good
men
but
most
of
them
know
nothing
about
infantry
fighting
we
put
them
into
platoons
and
done
our
best
to
give
them
some
kind
of
training
there
one
thing
may
cheer
you
we
plenty
of
there
a
school
near
by
and
we
got
all
the
men
who
were
taking
the
course
and
all
the
plant
i
do
suppose
there
was
ever
such
a
force
put
into
the
field
before
it
was
a
wilder
medley
than
moussy
at
first
ypres
there
was
every
kind
of
detail
in
the
shape
of
men
returning
from
leave
representing
most
of
the
regiments
in
the
army
there
were
the
men
from
the
school
there
were
corps
troops
sappers
and
and
a
handful
of
corps
cavalry
above
all
there
was
a
batch
of
american
engineers
fathered
by
blenkiron
i
inspected
them
where
they
were
drilling
and
liked
the
look
of
them
hours
i
said
to
myself
luck
we
may
just
pull
it
off
then
i
borrowed
a
bicycle
and
went
back
to
the
division
but
before
i
left
i
had
a
word
with
archie
is
one
big
game
of
bluff
and
you
fellows
alone
that
enable
us
to
play
it
tell
your
people
that
everything
depends
on
them
they
must
stint
the
planes
in
this
sector
for
if
the
boche
once
suspicions
how
little
he
got
before
him
the
game
up
he
not
a
fool
and
he
knows
that
this
is
the
short
road
to
amiens
but
he
imagines
we
holding
it
in
strength
if
we
keep
up
the
fiction
for
another
two
days
the
thing
done
you
say
he
pushing
up
troops
and
he
sendin
forward
his
tanks
that
take
time
he
slower
now
than
a
week
ago
and
he
got
a
deuce
of
a
country
to
march
over
there
still
an
outside
chance
we
may
win
through
you
go
home
and
tell
the
what
i
told
you
he
nodded
the
way
sir
pienaar
with
the
squadron
he
would
like
to
come
up
and
see
you
i
said
solemnly
a
good
chap
and
do
me
a
favour
if
i
think
peter
anywhere
near
the
line
i
go
off
my
head
with
worry
this
is
no
place
for
a
man
with
a
bad
leg
he
should
have
been
in
england
days
ago
ca
you
get
him
off
to
amiens
anyhow
scarcely
like
to
you
see
we
all
desperately
sorry
for
him
his
fun
gone
and
his
career
over
and
all
that
he
likes
bein
with
us
and
listenin
to
our
yarns
he
has
been
up
once
or
twice
too
the
he
swears
it
a
great
make
and
certainly
he
knows
how
to
handle
the
little
devil
for
heaven
sake
do
let
him
do
it
again
i
look
to
you
archie
remember
promise
thing
but
he
always
worryin
about
you
he
has
a
map
on
which
he
marks
every
day
the
changes
in
the
position
and
he
hobble
a
mile
to
pump
any
of
our
fellows
who
have
been
up
your
way
that
night
under
cover
of
darkness
i
drew
back
the
division
to
the
newly
prepared
lines
we
got
away
easily
for
the
enemy
was
busy
with
his
own
affairs
i
suspected
a
relief
by
fresh
troops
there
was
no
time
to
lose
and
i
can
tell
you
i
toiled
to
get
things
straight
before
dawn
i
would
have
liked
to
send
my
own
fellows
back
to
rest
but
i
could
spare
them
yet
i
wanted
them
to
stiffen
the
fresh
lot
for
they
were
veterans
the
new
position
was
arranged
on
the
same
principles
as
the
old
front
which
had
been
broken
on
march
there
was
our
forward
zone
consisting
of
an
outpost
line
and
redoubts
very
cleverly
sited
and
a
line
of
resistance
well
behind
it
were
the
trenches
which
formed
the
both
zones
were
heavily
wired
and
we
had
plenty
of
i
wish
i
could
say
we
had
plenty
of
men
who
knew
how
to
use
them
the
outposts
were
merely
to
give
the
alarm
and
fall
back
to
the
line
of
resistance
which
was
to
hold
out
to
the
last
in
the
forward
zone
i
put
the
freshest
of
my
own
men
the
units
being
brought
up
to
something
like
strength
by
the
details
returning
from
leave
that
the
corps
had
commandeered
with
them
i
put
the
american
engineers
partly
in
the
redoubts
and
partly
in
companies
for
blenkiron
had
reported
that
they
could
shoot
like
boone
and
were
simply
spoiling
for
a
fight
the
rest
of
the
force
was
in
the
which
was
our
last
hope
if
that
went
the
boche
had
a
clear
walk
to
amiens
some
additional
field
batteries
had
been
brought
up
to
support
our
very
weak
divisional
artillery
the
front
was
so
long
that
i
had
to
put
all
three
of
my
emaciated
brigades
in
the
line
so
i
had
nothing
to
speak
of
in
reserve
it
was
a
most
almighty
gamble
we
had
found
shelter
just
in
time
at
next
day
for
a
change
it
was
a
clear
morning
with
clouds
beginning
to
bank
up
from
the
west
the
boche
let
us
know
he
was
alive
he
gave
us
a
good
drenching
with
gas
shells
which
did
do
much
harm
and
then
messed
up
our
forward
zone
with
his
trench
mortars
at
his
men
began
to
come
on
first
little
bunches
with
and
then
the
infantry
in
waves
it
was
clear
they
were
fresh
troops
and
we
learned
afterwards
from
prisoners
that
they
were
bavarians
or
i
forget
which
but
the
division
that
hung
us
up
at
monchy
at
the
same
time
there
was
the
sound
of
a
tremendous
bombardment
across
the
river
it
looked
as
if
the
main
battle
had
swung
from
albert
and
montdidier
to
a
direct
push
for
amiens
i
have
often
tried
to
write
down
the
events
of
that
day
i
tried
it
in
my
report
to
the
corps
i
tried
it
in
my
own
diary
i
tried
it
because
mary
wanted
it
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
make
any
story
that
hung
together
perhaps
i
was
too
tired
for
my
mind
to
retain
clear
impressions
though
at
the
time
i
was
not
conscious
of
special
fatigue
more
likely
it
is
because
the
fight
itself
was
so
confused
for
nothing
happened
according
to
the
books
and
the
orderly
soul
of
the
boche
must
have
been
scarified
at
first
it
went
as
i
expected
the
outpost
line
was
pushed
in
but
the
fire
from
the
redoubts
broke
up
the
advance
and
enabled
the
line
of
resistance
in
the
forward
zone
to
give
a
good
account
of
itself
there
was
a
check
and
then
another
big
wave
assisted
by
a
barrage
from
brought
far
forward
this
time
the
line
of
resistance
gave
at
several
points
and
lefroy
flung
in
the
americans
in
a
that
was
a
mighty
performance
the
engineers
yelling
like
dervishes
went
at
it
with
the
bayonet
and
those
that
preferred
swung
their
rifles
as
clubs
it
was
terribly
costly
fighting
and
all
wrong
but
it
succeeded
they
cleared
the
boche
out
of
a
ruined
farm
he
had
rushed
and
a
little
wood
and
our
front
blenkiron
who
saw
it
all
for
he
went
with
them
and
got
the
tip
of
an
ear
picked
off
by
a
bullet
had
any
words
wherewith
to
speak
of
it
i
once
said
those
boys
looked
puffy
he
moaned
the
next
phase
which
came
about
midday
was
the
tanks
i
had
never
seen
the
german
variety
but
had
heard
that
it
was
speedier
and
heavier
than
ours
but
unwieldy
we
did
not
see
much
of
their
speed
but
we
found
out
all
about
their
clumsiness
had
the
things
been
properly
handled
they
should
have
gone
through
us
like
rotten
wood
but
the
whole
outfit
was
bungled
it
looked
good
enough
country
for
the
use
of
them
but
the
men
who
made
our
position
had
had
an
eye
to
this
possibility
the
great
monsters
mounting
a
besides
other
contrivances
wanted
something
like
a
highroad
to
be
happy
in
they
were
useless
over
anything
like
difficult
ground
the
ones
that
came
down
the
main
road
got
on
well
enough
at
the
start
but
blenkiron
very
sensibly
had
mined
the
highway
and
we
blew
a
hole
like
a
diamond
pit
one
lay
helpless
at
the
foot
of
it
and
we
took
the
crew
prisoner
another
stuck
its
nose
over
and
remained
there
till
our
got
the
range
and
knocked
it
silly
as
for
the
rest
there
is
a
marshy
lagoon
called
the
patte
beside
the
farm
of
gavrelle
which
runs
all
the
way
north
to
the
river
though
in
most
places
it
only
seems
like
a
soft
patch
in
the
meadows
this
the
tanks
had
to
cross
to
reach
our
line
and
they
never
made
it
most
got
bogged
and
made
pretty
targets
for
our
gunners
one
or
two
returned
and
one
the
americans
creeping
forward
under
cover
of
a
little
stream
blew
up
with
a
time
fuse
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
i
was
feeling
happier
i
knew
the
big
attack
was
still
to
come
but
i
had
my
forward
zone
intact
and
i
hoped
for
the
best
i
remember
i
was
talking
to
wake
who
had
been
going
between
the
two
zones
when
i
got
the
first
warning
of
a
new
and
unexpected
peril
a
dud
shell
plumped
down
a
few
yards
from
me
fools
across
the
river
are
firing
short
and
badly
off
the
straight
i
said
wake
examined
the
shell
it
a
german
one
he
said
then
came
others
and
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
the
direction
followed
by
a
burst
of
fire
from
the
same
quarter
we
ran
in
cover
to
a
point
from
which
we
could
see
the
north
bank
of
the
river
and
i
got
my
glass
on
it
there
was
a
lift
of
land
from
behind
which
the
fire
was
coming
we
looked
at
each
other
and
the
same
conviction
stood
in
both
faces
the
boche
had
pushed
down
the
northern
bank
and
we
were
no
longer
in
line
with
our
neighbours
the
enemy
was
in
a
situation
to
catch
us
with
his
fire
on
our
flank
and
left
rear
we
could
retire
to
conform
for
to
retire
meant
giving
up
our
prepared
position
it
was
the
last
straw
to
all
our
anxieties
and
for
a
moment
i
was
at
the
end
of
my
wits
i
turned
to
wake
and
his
calm
eyes
pulled
me
together
they
ca
retake
that
ground
we
fairly
carted
i
said
are
therefore
they
must
retake
it
must
get
on
to
mitchinson
but
as
i
spoke
i
realized
the
futility
of
a
telephone
message
to
a
man
who
was
pretty
hard
up
against
it
himself
only
an
urgent
appeal
could
effect
anything
i
must
go
myself
no
that
was
impossible
i
must
send
lefroy
but
he
could
be
spared
and
all
my
staff
officers
were
up
to
their
necks
in
the
battle
besides
none
of
them
knew
the
position
as
i
knew
it
and
how
to
get
there
it
was
a
long
way
round
by
the
bridge
at
loisy
suddenly
i
was
aware
of
wake
voice
had
better
send
me
he
was
saying
only
one
way
to
swim
the
river
a
little
lower
down
too
damnably
dangerous
i
wo
send
any
man
to
certain
death
i
volunteer
he
said
i
believe
is
always
allowed
in
war
you
be
killed
before
you
can
cross
a
man
with
me
to
watch
if
i
get
over
you
may
be
sure
i
get
to
general
mitchinson
if
not
send
somebody
else
by
loisy
desperate
need
for
hurry
and
you
see
yourself
it
the
only
way
the
time
was
past
for
argument
i
scribbled
a
line
to
mitchinson
as
his
credentials
no
more
was
needed
for
wake
knew
the
position
as
well
as
i
did
i
sent
an
orderly
to
accompany
him
to
his
on
the
bank
he
said
as
we
shook
hands
see
i
come
back
all
right
his
face
i
remember
looked
singularly
happy
five
minutes
later
the
boche
guns
opened
for
the
final
attack
i
believe
i
kept
a
cool
head
at
least
so
lefroy
and
the
others
reported
they
said
i
went
about
all
afternoon
grinning
as
if
i
liked
it
and
that
i
never
raised
my
voice
once
it
rather
a
fault
of
mine
that
i
bellow
in
a
scrap
but
i
know
i
was
feeling
anything
but
calm
for
the
problem
was
ghastly
it
all
depended
on
wake
and
mitchinson
the
flanking
fire
was
so
bad
that
i
had
to
give
up
the
left
of
the
forward
zone
which
caught
it
fairly
and
retire
the
men
there
to
the
the
latter
was
better
protected
for
between
it
and
the
river
was
a
small
wood
and
the
bank
rose
into
a
bluff
which
sloped
inwards
towards
us
this
withdrawal
meant
a
switch
and
a
switch
a
pretty
thing
when
it
has
to
be
improvised
in
the
middle
of
a
battle
the
boche
had
counted
on
that
flanking
fire
his
plan
was
to
break
our
two
wings
the
old
boche
plan
which
crops
up
in
every
fight
he
left
our
centre
at
first
pretty
well
alone
and
thrust
along
the
river
bank
and
to
the
wood
of
la
bruyere
where
we
linked
up
with
the
division
on
our
right
lefroy
was
in
the
first
area
and
masterton
in
the
second
and
for
three
hours
it
was
as
desperate
a
business
as
i
have
ever
faced
the
improvised
switch
went
and
more
and
more
of
the
forward
zone
disappeared
it
was
a
hot
clear
spring
afternoon
and
in
the
open
fighting
the
enemy
came
on
like
troops
at
manoeuvres
on
the
left
they
got
into
the
and
i
can
see
yet
lefroy
great
figure
leading
a
in
person
his
face
all
puddled
with
blood
from
a
scalp
wound
i
would
have
given
my
soul
to
be
in
two
places
at
once
but
i
had
to
risk
our
left
and
keep
close
to
masterton
who
needed
me
most
the
wood
of
la
bruyere
was
the
maddest
sight
again
and
again
the
boche
was
almost
through
it
you
never
knew
where
he
was
and
most
of
the
fighting
there
was
duels
between
parties
some
of
the
enemy
got
round
behind
us
and
only
a
fine
performance
of
a
company
of
cheshires
saved
a
complete
breakthrough
as
for
lefroy
i
do
know
how
he
stuck
it
out
and
he
does
know
himself
for
he
was
galled
all
the
time
by
that
accursed
flanking
fire
i
got
a
note
about
half
past
four
saying
that
wake
had
crossed
the
river
but
it
was
some
weary
hours
after
that
before
the
fire
slackened
i
tore
back
and
forward
between
my
wings
and
every
time
i
went
north
i
expected
to
find
that
lefroy
had
broken
but
by
some
miracle
he
held
the
boches
were
in
his
time
and
again
but
he
always
flung
them
out
i
have
a
recollection
of
blenkiron
stark
mad
encouraging
his
americans
with
strange
tongues
once
as
i
passed
him
i
saw
that
he
had
his
left
arm
tied
up
his
blackened
face
grinned
at
me
bit
of
landscape
mighty
unsafe
for
democracy
he
croaked
the
love
of
mike
get
your
guns
on
to
those
devils
across
the
river
they
plaguing
my
boys
too
bad
it
was
about
seven
i
think
when
the
flanking
fire
slacked
off
but
it
was
not
because
of
our
divisional
guns
there
was
a
short
and
very
furious
burst
of
artillery
fire
on
the
north
bank
and
i
knew
it
was
british
then
things
began
to
happen
one
of
our
planes
they
had
been
marvels
all
day
swinging
down
like
hawks
for
bouts
with
the
boche
infantry
reported
that
mitchinson
was
attacking
hard
and
getting
on
well
that
eased
my
mind
and
i
started
off
for
masterton
who
was
in
greater
straits
than
ever
for
the
enemy
seemed
to
be
weakening
on
the
river
bank
and
putting
his
main
strength
in
against
our
right
but
my
stopped
me
on
the
road
he
said
wants
to
see
you
now
i
cried
ca
live
many
minutes
i
turned
and
followed
him
to
the
ruinous
cowshed
which
was
my
divisional
headquarters
wake
as
i
heard
later
had
swum
the
river
opposite
to
mitchinson
right
and
reached
the
other
shore
safely
though
the
current
was
whipped
with
bullets
but
he
had
scarcely
landed
before
he
was
badly
hit
by
shrapnel
in
the
groin
walking
at
first
with
support
and
then
carried
on
a
stretcher
he
managed
to
struggle
on
to
the
divisional
headquarters
where
he
gave
my
message
and
explained
the
situation
he
would
not
let
his
wound
be
looked
to
till
his
job
was
done
mitchinson
told
me
afterwards
that
with
a
face
grey
from
pain
he
drew
for
him
a
sketch
of
our
position
and
told
him
exactly
how
near
we
were
to
our
end
after
that
he
asked
to
be
sent
back
to
me
and
they
got
him
down
to
loisy
in
a
crowded
ambulance
and
then
up
to
us
in
a
returning
empty
the
who
looked
at
his
wound
saw
that
the
thing
was
hopeless
and
did
not
expect
him
to
live
beyond
loisy
he
was
bleeding
internally
and
no
surgeon
on
earth
could
have
saved
him
when
he
reached
us
he
was
almost
pulseless
but
he
recovered
for
a
moment
and
asked
for
me
i
found
him
with
blue
lips
and
a
face
drained
of
blood
lying
on
my
camp
bed
his
voice
was
very
small
and
far
away
goes
it
he
asked
god
we
pull
through
thanks
to
you
old
man
he
said
and
his
eyes
shut
he
opened
them
once
again
thing
life
a
year
ago
i
was
preaching
peace
i
still
preaching
it
i
not
sorry
i
held
his
hand
till
two
minutes
later
he
died
in
the
press
of
a
fight
one
scarcely
realizes
death
even
the
death
of
a
friend
it
was
up
to
me
to
make
good
my
assurance
to
wake
and
presently
i
was
off
to
masterton
there
in
that
shambles
of
la
bruyere
while
the
light
faded
there
was
a
desperate
and
most
bloody
struggle
it
was
the
last
lap
of
the
contest
twelve
hours
now
i
kept
telling
myself
and
the
french
will
be
here
and
we
have
done
our
task
alas
how
many
of
us
would
go
back
to
rest
hardly
able
to
totter
our
companies
went
in
again
they
had
gone
far
beyond
the
limits
of
mortal
endurance
but
the
human
spirit
can
defy
all
natural
laws
the
balance
trembled
hung
and
then
dropped
the
right
way
the
enemy
impetus
weakened
stopped
and
the
ebb
began
i
wanted
to
complete
the
job
our
artillery
put
up
a
sharp
barrage
and
the
little
i
had
left
comparatively
fresh
i
sent
in
for
a
most
of
the
men
were
untrained
but
there
was
that
in
our
ranks
which
dispensed
with
training
and
we
had
caught
the
enemy
at
the
moment
of
lowest
vitality
we
pushed
him
out
of
la
bruyere
we
pushed
him
back
to
our
old
forward
zone
we
pushed
him
out
of
that
zone
to
the
position
from
which
he
had
begun
the
day
but
there
was
no
rest
for
the
weary
we
had
lost
at
least
a
third
of
our
strength
and
we
had
to
man
the
same
long
line
we
consolidated
it
as
best
we
could
started
to
replace
the
wiring
that
had
been
destroyed
found
touch
with
the
division
on
our
right
and
established
outposts
then
after
a
conference
with
my
brigadiers
i
went
back
to
my
headquarters
too
tired
to
feel
either
satisfaction
or
anxiety
in
eight
hours
the
french
would
be
here
the
words
made
a
kind
of
litany
in
my
ears
in
the
cowshed
where
wake
had
lain
two
figures
awaited
me
the
candle
revealed
hamilton
and
amos
dirty
beyond
words
and
intricately
bandaged
they
stood
stiffly
to
attention
the
prisoner
said
hamilton
have
to
report
that
the
prisoner
is
deid
i
stared
at
them
for
i
had
forgotten
ivery
he
seemed
a
creature
of
a
world
that
had
passed
away
it
was
like
this
ever
sin
this
mornin
the
prisoner
seemed
to
wake
up
ye
mind
that
he
was
in
a
kind
of
dream
all
week
but
he
got
some
new
notion
in
his
heid
and
when
the
battle
began
he
exheebited
signs
of
restlessness
whiles
he
wad
lie
doun
in
the
trench
and
whiles
he
was
wantin
back
to
the
accordin
to
instructions
i
provided
him
wi
a
rifle
but
he
didna
seem
to
ken
how
to
handle
it
it
was
your
orders
sirr
that
he
was
to
have
means
to
defend
hisself
if
the
enemy
cam
on
so
amos
gie
him
a
trench
knife
but
verra
soon
he
looked
as
if
he
was
ettlin
to
cut
his
throat
so
i
deprived
him
of
it
hamilton
stopped
for
breath
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
reciting
a
lesson
with
no
stops
between
the
sentences
jaloused
sirr
that
he
wadna
last
oot
the
day
and
amos
here
was
of
the
same
opinion
the
end
came
at
twenty
minutes
past
three
i
ken
the
time
for
i
had
just
compared
my
watch
with
amos
ye
mind
that
the
gairmans
were
beginning
a
big
attack
we
were
in
the
front
trench
of
what
they
ca
the
and
amos
and
me
was
keepin
oor
eyes
on
the
enemy
who
could
be
obsairved
dribblin
ower
the
open
just
then
the
prisoner
catches
sight
of
the
enemy
and
jumps
up
on
the
top
amos
tried
to
hold
him
but
he
kicked
him
in
the
face
the
next
we
kenned
he
was
runnin
verra
fast
towards
the
enemy
holdin
his
hands
ower
his
heid
and
crying
out
loud
in
a
foreign
langwidge
was
german
said
the
scholarly
amos
through
his
broken
teeth
was
gairman
continued
hamilton
seemed
as
if
he
was
to
the
enemy
to
help
him
but
they
paid
no
attention
and
he
cam
under
the
fire
of
their
we
watched
him
spin
round
like
a
teetotum
and
kenned
that
he
was
bye
with
it
are
sure
he
was
killed
i
asked
sirr
when
we
we
fund
his
body
there
is
a
grave
close
by
the
farm
of
gavrelle
and
a
wooden
cross
at
its
head
bears
the
name
of
the
graf
von
schwabing
and
the
date
of
his
death
the
germans
took
gavrelle
a
little
later
i
am
glad
to
think
that
they
read
that
inscription
chapter
the
summons
comes
for
mr
standfast
i
slept
for
one
and
hours
that
night
and
when
i
awoke
i
seemed
to
emerge
from
deeps
of
slumber
which
had
lasted
for
days
that
happens
sometimes
after
heavy
fatigue
and
great
mental
strain
even
a
short
sleep
sets
up
a
barrier
between
past
and
present
which
has
to
be
elaborately
broken
down
before
you
can
link
on
with
what
has
happened
before
as
my
wits
groped
at
the
job
some
drops
of
rain
splashed
on
my
face
through
the
broken
roof
that
hurried
me
it
was
just
after
dawn
and
the
sky
was
piled
with
thick
clouds
while
a
wet
wind
blew
up
from
the
southwest
the
break
in
the
weather
seemed
to
have
come
at
last
a
deluge
of
rain
was
what
i
wanted
something
to
soak
the
earth
and
turn
the
roads
into
and
clog
the
enemy
transport
something
above
all
to
blind
the
enemy
eyes
for
i
remembered
what
a
preposterous
bluff
it
all
had
been
and
what
a
piteous
broken
handful
stood
between
the
germans
and
their
goal
if
they
knew
if
they
only
knew
they
would
brush
us
aside
like
flies
as
i
shaved
i
looked
back
on
the
events
of
yesterday
as
on
something
that
had
happened
long
ago
i
seemed
to
judge
them
impersonally
and
i
concluded
that
it
had
been
a
pretty
good
fight
a
scratch
force
half
of
it
and
half
of
it
untrained
had
held
up
at
least
a
couple
of
fresh
divisions
but
we
could
do
it
again
and
there
were
still
some
hours
before
us
of
desperate
peril
when
had
the
corps
said
that
the
french
would
arrive
i
was
on
the
point
of
shouting
for
hamilton
to
get
wake
to
ring
up
corps
headquarters
when
i
remembered
that
wake
was
dead
i
had
liked
him
and
greatly
admired
him
but
the
recollection
gave
me
scarcely
a
pang
we
were
all
dying
and
he
had
only
gone
on
a
stage
ahead
there
was
no
morning
strafe
such
as
had
been
our
usual
fortune
in
the
past
week
i
went
and
found
a
noiseless
world
under
the
lowering
sky
the
rain
had
stopped
falling
the
wind
of
dawn
had
lessened
and
i
feared
that
the
storm
would
be
delayed
i
wanted
it
at
once
to
help
us
through
the
next
hours
of
tension
was
it
in
six
hours
that
the
french
were
coming
no
it
must
be
four
it
could
be
more
than
four
unless
somebody
had
made
an
infernal
muddle
i
wondered
why
everything
was
so
quiet
it
would
be
breakfast
time
on
both
sides
but
there
seemed
no
stir
of
man
presence
in
that
ugly
strip
half
a
mile
off
only
far
back
in
the
german
hinterland
i
seemed
to
hear
the
rumour
of
traffic
an
unslept
and
unshaven
figure
stood
beside
me
which
revealed
itself
as
archie
roylance
up
all
night
he
said
cheerfully
lighting
a
cigarette
i
have
had
breakfast
the
skipper
thought
we
better
get
another
battery
up
this
way
and
i
was
superintendin
the
job
he
afraid
of
the
hun
gettin
over
your
lines
and
spying
out
the
nakedness
of
the
land
for
you
know
we
uncommon
naked
sir
also
and
archie
face
became
grave
hun
pourin
divisions
down
on
this
sector
as
i
judge
he
blowin
up
for
a
thunderin
big
drive
on
both
sides
of
the
river
our
lads
yesterday
said
all
the
country
back
of
peronne
was
lousy
with
new
troops
and
he
gettin
his
big
guns
forward
too
you
have
been
troubled
with
them
yet
but
he
has
got
the
roads
mended
and
the
devil
of
a
lot
of
new
light
railways
and
any
moment
we
have
the
sayin
pray
heaven
you
get
relieved
in
time
sir
i
take
it
there
not
much
risk
of
another
push
this
mornin
do
think
so
the
boche
took
a
nasty
knock
yesterday
and
he
must
fancy
we
pretty
strong
after
that
i
do
think
he
strike
till
he
can
work
both
sides
of
the
river
and
that
take
time
to
prepare
that
what
his
fresh
divisions
are
for
but
remember
he
can
attack
now
if
he
likes
if
he
knew
how
weak
we
were
he
strong
enough
to
send
us
all
to
glory
in
the
next
three
hours
it
just
that
knowledge
that
you
fellows
have
got
to
prevent
his
getting
if
a
single
hun
plane
crosses
our
lines
and
returns
wholly
and
utterly
done
you
given
us
splendid
help
since
the
show
began
archie
for
god
sake
keep
it
up
to
the
finish
and
put
every
machine
you
can
spare
in
this
sector
doin
our
best
he
said
got
some
more
fightin
scouts
down
from
the
north
and
we
keepin
our
eyes
skinned
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
sir
that
it
never
an
certainty
if
the
hun
sent
over
a
squadron
we
might
beat
all
down
but
one
and
that
one
might
do
the
trick
it
a
matter
of
luck
the
hun
got
the
wind
up
all
right
in
the
air
just
now
and
i
do
blame
the
poor
devil
inclined
to
think
we
have
had
the
pick
of
his
push
here
jennings
says
he
doin
good
work
in
flanders
and
they
reckon
there
the
deuce
of
a
thrust
comin
there
pretty
soon
i
think
we
can
manage
the
kind
of
footler
he
been
sendin
over
here
lately
but
if
lensch
or
some
lad
like
that
were
to
choose
to
turn
up
i
would
say
what
might
happen
the
air
a
big
lottery
and
archie
turned
a
dirty
face
skyward
where
two
of
our
planes
were
moving
very
high
towards
the
east
the
mention
of
lensch
brought
peter
to
mind
and
i
asked
if
he
had
gone
back
wo
go
said
archie
we
have
the
heart
to
make
him
very
happy
and
plays
about
with
the
gladas
he
always
speakin
about
you
sir
and
it
break
his
heart
if
we
shifted
him
i
asked
about
his
health
and
was
told
that
he
did
seem
to
have
much
pain
he
a
bit
queer
and
archie
shook
a
sage
head
of
the
reasons
why
he
wo
budge
is
because
he
says
god
has
some
work
for
him
to
do
he
quite
serious
about
it
and
ever
since
he
got
the
notion
he
has
perked
up
amazin
he
always
askin
about
lensch
too
not
vindictive
like
you
understand
but
quite
friendly
seems
to
take
a
sort
of
proprietary
interest
in
him
i
told
him
lensch
had
had
a
far
longer
spell
of
fightin
than
anybody
else
and
was
bound
by
the
law
of
averages
to
be
downed
soon
and
he
was
quite
sad
about
it
i
had
no
time
to
worry
about
peter
archie
and
i
swallowed
breakfast
and
i
had
a
with
my
brigadiers
by
this
time
i
had
got
through
to
corps
and
got
news
of
the
french
it
was
worse
than
i
expected
general
peguy
would
arrive
about
ten
but
his
men
could
take
over
till
well
after
midday
the
corps
gave
me
their
whereabouts
and
i
found
it
on
the
map
they
had
a
long
way
to
cover
yet
and
then
there
would
be
the
slow
business
of
relieving
i
looked
at
my
watch
there
were
still
six
hours
before
us
when
the
boche
might
knock
us
to
blazes
six
hours
of
maddening
anxiety
lefroy
announced
that
all
was
quiet
on
the
front
and
that
the
new
wiring
at
the
bois
de
la
bruyere
had
been
completed
patrols
had
reported
that
during
the
night
a
fresh
german
division
seemed
to
have
relieved
that
which
we
had
punished
so
stoutly
yesterday
i
asked
him
if
he
could
stick
it
out
against
another
attack
he
said
without
hesitation
too
few
and
too
shaky
on
our
pins
to
stand
any
more
i
only
a
man
to
every
three
yards
that
impressed
me
for
lefroy
was
usually
the
most
optimist
it
there
the
sun
i
heard
archie
cry
it
was
true
for
the
clouds
were
rolling
back
and
the
centre
of
the
heavens
was
a
patch
of
blue
the
storm
was
coming
i
could
smell
it
in
the
air
but
probably
it
would
break
till
the
evening
where
i
wondered
would
we
be
by
that
time
it
was
now
nine
and
i
was
keeping
tight
hold
on
myself
for
i
saw
that
i
was
going
to
have
hell
for
the
next
hours
i
am
a
pretty
stolid
fellow
in
some
ways
but
i
have
always
found
patience
and
standing
still
the
most
difficult
job
to
tackle
and
my
nerves
were
all
tattered
from
the
long
strain
of
the
retreat
i
went
up
to
the
line
and
saw
the
battalion
commanders
everything
was
unwholesomely
quiet
there
then
i
came
back
to
my
headquarters
to
study
the
reports
that
were
coming
in
from
the
air
patrols
they
all
said
the
same
thing
abnormal
activity
in
the
german
back
areas
things
seemed
shaping
for
a
new
of
march
and
if
our
luck
were
out
my
poor
little
remnant
would
have
to
take
the
shock
i
telephoned
to
the
corps
and
found
them
as
nervous
as
me
i
gave
them
the
details
of
my
strength
and
heard
an
agonized
whistle
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
i
was
rather
glad
i
had
companions
in
the
same
purgatory
i
found
i
could
sit
still
if
there
had
been
any
work
to
do
i
would
have
buried
myself
in
it
but
there
was
none
only
this
fearsome
job
of
waiting
i
hardly
ever
feel
cold
but
now
my
blood
seemed
to
be
getting
thin
and
i
astonished
my
staff
by
putting
on
a
british
warm
and
buttoning
up
the
collar
round
that
derelict
farm
i
ranged
like
a
hungry
wolf
cold
at
the
feet
queasy
in
the
stomach
and
mortally
edgy
in
the
mind
then
suddenly
the
cloud
lifted
from
me
and
the
blood
seemed
to
run
naturally
in
my
veins
i
experienced
the
change
of
mood
which
a
man
feels
sometimes
when
his
whole
being
is
fined
down
and
clarified
by
long
endurance
the
fight
of
yesterday
revealed
itself
as
something
rather
splendid
what
risks
we
had
run
and
how
gallantly
we
had
met
them
my
heart
warmed
as
i
thought
of
that
old
division
of
mine
those
ragged
veterans
that
were
never
beaten
as
long
as
breath
was
left
them
and
the
americans
and
the
boys
from
the
school
and
all
the
oddments
we
had
commandeered
and
old
blenkiron
raging
like
a
lion
it
was
against
reason
that
such
fortitude
win
out
we
had
snarled
round
and
bitten
the
boche
so
badly
that
he
wanted
no
more
for
a
little
he
would
come
again
but
presently
we
should
be
relieved
and
the
gallant
fresh
as
paint
and
burning
for
revenge
would
be
there
to
worry
him
i
had
no
new
facts
on
which
to
base
my
optimism
only
a
changed
point
of
view
and
with
it
came
a
recollection
of
other
things
wake
death
had
left
me
numb
before
but
now
the
thought
of
it
gave
me
a
sharp
pang
he
was
the
first
of
our
little
confederacy
to
go
but
what
an
ending
he
had
made
and
how
happy
he
had
been
in
that
mad
time
when
he
had
come
down
from
his
pedestal
and
become
one
of
the
crowd
he
had
found
himself
at
the
last
and
who
could
grudge
him
such
happiness
if
the
best
were
to
be
taken
he
would
be
chosen
first
for
he
was
a
big
man
before
whom
i
uncovered
my
head
the
thought
of
him
made
me
very
humble
i
had
never
had
his
troubles
to
face
but
he
had
come
clean
through
them
and
reached
a
courage
which
was
for
ever
beyond
me
he
was
the
faithful
among
us
pilgrims
who
had
finished
his
journey
before
the
rest
mary
had
foreseen
it
is
a
price
to
be
paid
she
had
said
best
of
us
and
at
the
thought
of
mary
a
flight
of
warm
and
happy
hopes
seemed
to
settle
on
my
mind
i
was
looking
again
beyond
the
war
to
that
peace
which
she
and
i
would
some
day
inherit
i
had
a
vision
of
a
green
english
landscape
with
its
scents
of
wood
and
meadow
and
garden
and
that
face
of
all
my
dreams
with
the
eyes
so
childlike
and
brave
and
honest
as
if
they
too
saw
beyond
the
dark
to
a
radiant
country
a
line
of
an
old
song
which
had
been
a
favourite
of
my
father
sang
itself
in
my
ears
an
eye
that
ever
weeps
and
a
fair
face
will
be
fain
when
i
ride
through
annan
water
wi
my
bonny
bands
again
we
were
standing
by
the
crumbling
rails
of
what
had
once
been
the
farm
sheepfold
i
looked
at
archie
and
he
smiled
back
at
me
for
he
saw
that
my
face
had
changed
then
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
billowing
clouds
i
felt
my
arm
clutched
there
said
a
fierce
voice
and
his
glasses
were
turned
upward
i
looked
and
far
up
in
the
sky
saw
a
thing
like
a
wedge
of
wild
geese
flying
towards
us
from
the
enemy
country
i
made
out
the
small
dots
which
composed
it
and
my
glass
told
me
they
were
planes
but
only
archie
practised
eye
knew
that
they
were
enemy
i
asked
he
said
god
we
for
it
now
my
heart
had
sunk
like
a
stone
but
i
was
fairly
cool
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
ten
minutes
to
eleven
many
said
archie
there
may
be
six
not
more
i
said
on
to
your
headquarters
tell
them
that
it
all
up
with
us
if
a
single
plane
gets
back
let
them
get
well
over
the
line
the
deeper
in
the
better
and
tell
them
to
send
up
every
machine
they
possess
and
down
them
all
tell
them
it
life
or
death
not
one
single
plane
goes
back
quick
archie
disappeared
and
as
he
went
our
guns
broke
out
the
formation
above
opened
and
zigzagged
but
they
were
too
high
to
be
in
much
danger
but
they
were
not
too
high
to
see
that
which
we
must
keep
hidden
or
perish
the
roar
of
our
batteries
died
down
as
the
invaders
passed
westward
as
i
watched
their
progress
they
seemed
to
be
dropping
lower
then
they
rose
again
and
a
bank
of
cloud
concealed
them
i
had
a
horrid
certainty
that
they
must
beat
us
that
some
at
any
rate
would
get
back
they
had
seen
thin
lines
and
the
roads
behind
us
empty
of
supports
they
would
see
as
they
advanced
the
blue
columns
of
the
french
coming
up
from
the
and
they
would
return
and
tell
the
enemy
that
a
blow
now
would
open
the
road
to
amiens
and
the
sea
he
had
plenty
of
strength
for
it
and
presently
he
would
have
overwhelming
strength
it
only
needed
a
to
burst
the
dam
and
let
the
flood
through
they
would
return
in
twenty
minutes
and
by
noon
we
would
be
broken
unless
unless
the
miracle
of
miracles
happened
and
they
never
returned
archie
reported
that
his
skipper
would
do
his
damnedest
and
that
our
machines
were
now
going
up
a
chance
sir
he
said
good
sportin
chance
it
was
a
new
archie
with
a
hard
voice
a
lean
face
and
very
old
eyes
behind
the
jagged
walls
of
the
farm
buildings
was
a
knoll
which
had
once
formed
part
of
the
i
went
up
there
alone
for
i
want
anybody
near
me
i
wanted
a
viewpoint
and
i
wanted
quiet
for
i
had
a
grim
time
before
me
from
that
knoll
i
had
a
big
prospect
of
country
i
looked
east
to
our
lines
on
which
an
occasional
shell
was
falling
and
where
i
could
hear
the
chatter
of
west
there
was
peace
for
the
woods
closed
down
on
the
landscape
up
to
the
north
i
remember
there
was
a
big
glare
as
from
a
burning
dump
and
heavy
guns
seemed
to
be
at
work
in
the
ancre
valley
down
in
the
south
there
was
the
dull
murmur
of
a
great
battle
but
just
around
me
in
the
gap
the
deadliest
place
of
all
there
was
an
odd
quiet
i
could
pick
out
clearly
the
different
sounds
somebody
down
at
the
farm
had
made
a
joke
and
there
was
a
short
burst
of
laughter
i
envied
the
humorist
his
composure
there
was
a
clatter
and
jingle
from
a
battery
changing
position
on
the
road
a
tractor
was
jolting
along
i
could
hear
its
driver
shout
and
the
screech
of
its
unoiled
axle
my
eyes
were
glued
to
my
glasses
but
they
shook
in
my
hands
so
that
i
could
scarcely
see
i
bit
my
lip
to
steady
myself
but
they
still
wavered
from
time
to
time
i
glanced
at
my
watch
eight
minutes
gone
ten
seventeen
if
only
the
planes
would
come
into
sight
even
the
certainty
of
failure
would
be
better
than
this
harrowing
doubt
they
should
be
back
by
now
unless
they
had
swung
north
across
the
salient
or
unless
the
miracle
of
miracles
then
came
the
distant
yapping
of
an
gun
caught
up
the
next
second
by
others
while
smoke
patches
studded
the
distant
blue
sky
the
clouds
were
banking
in
but
to
the
west
there
was
a
big
clear
space
now
woolly
with
shrapnel
bursts
i
counted
them
mechanically
one
three
five
nine
with
despair
beginning
to
take
the
place
of
my
anxiety
my
hands
were
steady
now
and
through
the
glasses
i
saw
the
enemy
five
attenuated
shapes
rode
high
above
the
bombardment
now
sharp
against
the
blue
now
lost
in
a
film
of
vapour
they
were
coming
back
serenely
contemptuously
having
seen
all
they
wanted
the
quiet
was
gone
now
and
the
din
was
monstrous
guns
singly
and
in
groups
were
firing
from
every
side
as
i
watched
it
seemed
a
futile
waste
of
ammunition
the
enemy
did
give
a
curse
for
it
but
surely
there
was
one
down
i
could
only
count
four
now
no
there
was
the
fifth
coming
out
of
a
cloud
in
ten
minutes
they
would
be
all
over
the
line
i
fairly
stamped
in
my
vexation
those
guns
were
no
more
use
than
a
sick
headache
oh
where
in
god
name
were
our
own
planes
at
that
moment
they
came
streaking
down
into
sight
four
with
the
sun
glinting
on
their
wings
and
burnishing
their
metal
cowls
i
saw
clearly
the
rings
of
red
white
and
blue
before
their
downward
drive
the
enemy
instantly
spread
out
i
was
watching
with
bare
eyes
now
and
i
wanted
companionship
for
the
time
of
waiting
was
over
automatically
i
must
have
run
down
the
knoll
for
the
next
i
knew
i
was
staring
at
the
heavens
with
archie
by
my
side
the
combatants
seemed
to
couple
instinctively
diving
wheeling
climbing
a
pair
would
drop
out
of
the
melee
or
disappear
behind
a
cloud
even
at
that
height
i
could
hear
the
methodical
of
the
then
there
was
a
sudden
flare
and
wisp
of
smoke
a
plane
sank
turning
and
twisting
to
earth
said
archie
who
had
his
glasses
on
it
almost
immediately
another
followed
this
time
the
pilot
recovered
himself
while
still
a
thousand
feet
from
the
ground
and
started
gliding
for
the
enemy
lines
then
he
wavered
plunged
sickeningly
and
fell
headlong
into
the
wood
behind
la
bruyere
farther
east
almost
over
the
front
trenches
a
albatross
and
a
british
pilot
were
having
a
desperate
tussle
the
bombardment
had
stopped
and
from
where
we
stood
every
movement
could
be
followed
first
one
then
another
climbed
uppermost
and
dived
back
swooped
out
and
wheeled
in
again
so
that
the
two
planes
seemed
to
clear
each
other
only
by
inches
then
it
looked
as
if
they
closed
and
interlocked
i
expected
to
see
both
go
crashing
when
suddenly
the
wings
of
one
seemed
to
shrivel
up
and
the
machine
dropped
like
a
stone
said
archie
makes
three
oh
good
lads
good
lads
then
i
saw
something
which
took
away
my
breath
sloping
down
in
wide
circles
came
a
german
machine
and
following
a
little
behind
and
a
little
above
a
british
it
was
the
first
surrender
in
i
had
seen
in
my
amazement
i
watched
the
couple
right
down
to
the
ground
till
the
enemy
landed
in
a
big
meadow
across
the
and
our
own
man
in
a
field
nearer
the
river
when
i
looked
back
into
the
sky
it
was
bare
north
south
east
and
west
there
was
not
a
sign
of
aircraft
british
or
german
a
violent
trembling
took
me
archie
was
sweeping
the
heavens
with
his
glasses
and
muttering
to
himself
where
was
the
fifth
man
he
must
have
fought
his
way
through
and
it
was
too
late
but
was
it
from
the
toe
of
a
great
rolling
a
flame
shot
earthwards
followed
by
a
trail
of
smoke
british
or
boche
british
or
boche
i
did
wait
long
for
an
answer
for
riding
over
the
far
end
of
the
cloud
came
two
of
our
fighting
scouts
i
tried
to
be
cool
and
snapped
my
glasses
into
their
case
though
the
reaction
made
me
want
to
shout
archie
turned
to
me
with
a
nervous
smile
and
a
quivering
mouth
think
we
have
won
on
the
post
he
said
he
reached
out
a
hand
for
mine
his
eyes
still
on
the
sky
and
i
was
grasping
it
when
it
was
torn
away
he
was
staring
upwards
with
a
white
face
we
were
looking
at
the
sixth
enemy
plane
it
had
been
behind
the
others
and
much
lower
and
was
making
straight
at
a
great
speed
for
the
east
the
glasses
showed
me
a
different
type
of
machine
a
big
machine
with
short
wings
which
looked
menacing
as
a
hawk
in
a
covey
of
grouse
it
was
under
the
and
above
satisfied
easing
down
after
their
fight
and
unwitting
of
this
enemy
rode
the
two
british
craft
a
neighbouring
gun
broke
out
into
a
sudden
burst
and
i
thanked
heaven
for
its
inspiration
curious
as
to
this
new
development
the
two
british
turned
caught
sight
of
the
boche
and
dived
for
him
what
happened
in
the
next
minutes
i
can
not
tell
the
three
seemed
to
be
mixed
up
in
a
dog
fight
so
that
i
could
not
distinguish
friend
from
foe
my
hands
no
longer
trembled
i
was
too
desperate
the
patter
of
came
down
to
us
and
then
one
of
the
three
broke
clear
and
began
to
climb
the
others
strained
to
follow
but
in
a
second
he
had
risen
beyond
their
fire
for
he
had
easily
the
pace
of
them
was
it
the
hun
archie
dry
lips
were
talking
lensch
he
said
know
i
gasped
angrily
mistake
him
look
at
the
way
he
slipped
out
as
he
banked
his
patent
trick
in
that
agonizing
moment
hope
died
in
me
i
was
perfectly
calm
now
for
the
time
for
anxiety
had
gone
farther
and
farther
drifted
the
british
pilots
behind
while
lensch
in
the
completeness
of
his
triumph
looped
more
than
once
as
if
to
cry
an
insulting
farewell
in
less
than
three
minutes
he
would
be
safe
inside
his
own
lines
and
he
carried
the
knowledge
which
for
us
was
death
someone
was
bawling
in
my
ear
and
pointing
upward
it
was
archie
and
his
face
was
wild
i
looked
and
gasped
seized
my
glasses
and
looked
again
a
second
before
lensch
had
been
alone
now
there
were
two
machines
i
heard
archie
voice
god
it
the
gladas
the
little
gladas
his
fingers
were
digging
into
my
arm
and
his
face
was
against
my
shoulder
and
then
his
excitement
sobered
into
an
awe
which
choked
his
speech
as
he
stammered
old
but
i
did
not
need
him
to
tell
me
the
name
for
i
had
divined
it
when
i
first
saw
the
new
plane
drop
from
the
clouds
i
had
that
queer
sense
that
comes
sometimes
to
a
man
that
a
friend
is
present
when
he
can
not
see
him
somewhere
up
in
the
void
two
heroes
were
fighting
their
last
battle
and
one
of
them
had
a
crippled
leg
i
had
never
any
doubt
about
the
result
though
archie
told
me
later
that
he
went
crazy
with
suspense
lensch
was
not
aware
of
his
opponent
till
he
was
almost
upon
him
and
i
wonder
if
by
any
freak
of
instinct
he
recognized
his
greatest
antagonist
he
never
fired
a
shot
nor
did
peter
i
saw
the
german
twist
and
as
if
to
baffle
the
fate
descending
upon
him
i
saw
peter
veer
over
vertically
and
i
knew
that
the
end
had
come
he
was
there
to
make
certain
of
victory
and
he
took
the
only
way
the
machines
closed
there
was
a
crash
which
i
felt
though
i
could
not
hear
it
and
next
second
both
were
hurtling
down
over
and
over
to
the
earth
they
fell
in
the
river
just
short
of
the
enemy
lines
but
i
did
not
see
them
for
my
eyes
were
blinded
and
i
was
on
my
knees
after
that
it
was
all
a
dream
i
found
myself
being
embraced
by
a
french
general
of
division
and
saw
the
first
companies
of
the
cheerful
bluecoats
whom
i
had
longed
for
with
them
came
the
rain
and
it
was
under
a
weeping
april
sky
that
early
in
the
night
i
marched
what
was
left
of
my
division
away
from
the
the
enemy
guns
were
starting
to
speak
behind
us
but
i
did
not
heed
them
i
knew
that
now
there
were
warders
at
the
gate
and
i
believed
that
by
the
grace
of
god
that
gate
was
barred
for
ever
they
took
peter
from
the
wreckage
with
scarcely
a
scar
except
his
twisted
leg
death
had
smoothed
out
some
of
the
age
in
him
and
left
his
face
much
as
i
remembered
it
long
ago
in
the
mashonaland
hills
in
his
pocket
was
his
old
battered
it
lies
before
me
as
i
write
and
beside
it
for
i
was
his
only
legatee
the
little
case
which
came
to
him
weeks
later
containing
the
highest
honour
that
can
be
bestowed
upon
a
soldier
of
britain
it
was
from
the
that
i
read
next
morning
when
in
the
lee
of
an
mary
and
blenkiron
and
i
stood
in
the
soft
spring
rain
beside
his
grave
and
what
i
read
was
the
tale
in
the
end
not
of
mr
standfast
whom
he
had
singled
out
for
his
counterpart
but
of
mr
whom
he
had
not
hoped
to
emulate
i
set
down
the
words
as
a
salute
and
a
farewell
said
he
am
going
to
my
father
and
though
with
great
difficulty
i
am
got
hither
yet
now
i
do
not
repent
me
of
all
the
trouble
i
have
been
at
to
arrive
where
i
am
my
sword
i
give
to
him
that
shall
succeed
me
in
my
pilgrimage
and
my
courage
and
skill
to
him
that
can
get
it
my
marks
and
scars
i
carry
with
me
to
be
a
witness
for
me
that
i
have
fought
his
battles
who
now
will
be
my
he
passed
over
and
all
the
trumpets
sounded
for
him
on
the
other
