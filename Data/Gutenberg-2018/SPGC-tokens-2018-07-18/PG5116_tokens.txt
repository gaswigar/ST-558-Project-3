pragmatism
a
new
name
for
some
old
ways
of
thinking
by
william
james
to
the
memory
of
john
stuart
mill
from
whom
i
first
learned
the
pragmatic
openness
of
mind
and
whom
my
fancy
likes
to
picture
as
our
leader
were
he
alive
preface
the
lectures
that
follow
were
delivered
at
the
lowell
institute
in
boston
in
november
and
december
and
in
january
at
columbia
university
in
new
york
they
are
printed
as
delivered
without
developments
or
notes
the
pragmatic
movement
i
do
not
like
the
name
but
apparently
it
is
too
late
to
change
it
seems
to
have
rather
suddenly
precipitated
itself
out
of
the
air
a
number
of
tendencies
that
have
always
existed
in
philosophy
have
all
at
once
become
conscious
of
themselves
collectively
and
of
their
combined
mission
and
this
has
occurred
in
so
many
countries
and
from
so
many
different
points
of
view
that
much
unconcerted
statement
has
resulted
i
have
sought
to
unify
the
picture
as
it
presents
itself
to
my
own
eyes
dealing
in
broad
strokes
and
avoiding
minute
controversy
much
futile
controversy
might
have
been
avoided
i
believe
if
our
critics
had
been
willing
to
wait
until
we
got
our
message
fairly
out
if
my
lectures
interest
any
reader
in
the
general
subject
he
will
doubtless
wish
to
read
farther
i
therefore
give
him
a
few
references
in
america
john
dewey
in

are
the
foundation
read
also
by

the
articles
in
the
philosophical
review
vol
xv
pp
and
in

vol
xv
and
in
the
journal
of
philosophy
vol

probably
the
best
statements
to
begin
with
however
are
schiller
in
his
in
humanism
especially
the
essays
numbered
i
v
vi
vii
xviii
and
xix
his
previous
essays
and
in
general
the
polemic
literature
of
the
subject
are
fully
referred
to
in
his
footnotes
furthermore
see
milhaud
le
rationnel
and
the
fine
articles
by
le
roy
in

announces
a
book
on
pragmatism
in
the
french
language
to
be
published
very
soon
to
avoid
one
misunderstanding
at
least
let
me
say
that
there
is
no
logical
connexion
between
pragmatism
as
i
understand
it
and
a
doctrine
which
i
have
recently
set
forth
as
empiricism
the
latter
stands
on
its
own
feet
one
may
entirely
reject
it
and
still
be
a
pragmatist

lecture
i
the
present
dilemma
in
philosophy
in
the
preface
to
that
admirable
collection
of
essays
of
his
called
chesterton
writes
these
words
there
are
some
people
and
i
am
one
of
them
who
think
that
the
most
practical
and
important
thing
about
a
man
is
still
his
view
of
the
universe
we
think
that
for
a
landlady
considering
a
lodger
it
is
important
to
know
his
income
but
still
more
important
to
know
his
philosophy
we
think
that
for
a
general
about
to
fight
an
enemy
it
is
important
to
know
the
enemy
numbers
but
still
more
important
to
know
the
philosophy
we
think
the
question
is
not
whether
the
theory
of
the
cosmos
affects
matters
but
whether
in
the
long
run
anything
else
affects
them
i
think
with
chesterton
in
this
matter
i
know
that
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
have
a
philosophy
each
and
all
of
you
and
that
the
most
interesting
and
important
thing
about
you
is
the
way
in
which
it
determines
the
perspective
in
your
several
worlds
you
know
the
same
of
me
and
yet
i
confess
to
a
certain
tremor
at
the
audacity
of
the
enterprise
which
i
am
about
to
begin
for
the
philosophy
which
is
so
important
in
each
of
us
is
not
a
technical
matter
it
is
our
more
or
less
dumb
sense
of
what
life
honestly
and
deeply
means
it
is
only
partly
got
from
books
it
is
our
individual
way
of
just
seeing
and
feeling
the
total
push
and
pressure
of
the
cosmos
i
have
no
right
to
assume
that
many
of
you
are
students
of
the
cosmos
in
the
sense
yet
here
i
stand
desirous
of
interesting
you
in
a
philosophy
which
to
no
small
extent
has
to
be
technically
treated
i
wish
to
fill
you
with
sympathy
with
a
contemporaneous
tendency
in
which
i
profoundly
believe
and
yet
i
have
to
talk
like
a
professor
to
you
who
are
not
students
whatever
universe
a
professor
believes
in
must
at
any
rate
be
a
universe
that
lends
itself
to
lengthy
discourse
a
universe
definable
in
two
sentences
is
something
for
which
the
professorial
intellect
has
no
use
no
faith
in
anything
of
that
cheap
kind
i
have
heard
friends
and
colleagues
try
to
popularize
philosophy
in
this
very
hall
but
they
soon
grew
dry
and
then
technical
and
the
results
were
only
partially
encouraging
so
my
enterprise
is
a
bold
one
the
founder
of
pragmatism
himself
recently
gave
a
course
of
lectures
at
the
lowell
institute
with
that
very
word
in
its
of
brilliant
light
relieved
against
cimmerian
darkness
none
of
us
i
fancy
understood
all
that
he
said
yet
here
i
stand
making
a
very
similar
venture
i
risk
it
because
the
very
lectures
i
speak
of
drew
they
brought
good
audiences
there
is
it
must
be
confessed
a
curious
fascination
in
hearing
deep
things
talked
about
even
tho
neither
we
nor
the
disputants
understand
them
we
get
the
problematic
thrill
we
feel
the
presence
of
the
vastness
let
a
controversy
begin
in
a
anywhere
about
or
god
omniscience
or
good
and
evil
and
see
how
everyone
in
the
place
pricks
up
his
ears
philosophy
results
concern
us
all
most
vitally
and
philosophy
queerest
arguments
tickle
agreeably
our
sense
of
subtlety
and
ingenuity
believing
in
philosophy
myself
devoutly
and
believing
also
that
a
kind
of
new
dawn
is
breaking
upon
us
philosophers
i
feel
impelled
per
fas
aut
nefas
to
try
to
impart
to
you
some
news
of
the
situation
philosophy
is
at
once
the
most
sublime
and
the
most
trivial
of
human
pursuits
it
works
in
the
minutest
crannies
and
it
opens
out
the
widest
vistas
it
no
bread
as
has
been
said
but
it
can
inspire
our
souls
with
courage
and
repugnant
as
its
manners
its
doubting
and
challenging
its
quibbling
and
dialectics
often
are
to
common
people
no
one
of
us
can
get
along
without
the
beams
of
light
it
sends
over
the
world
perspectives
these
illuminations
at
least
and
the
of
darkness
and
mystery
that
accompany
them
give
to
what
it
says
an
interest
that
is
much
more
than
professional
the
history
of
philosophy
is
to
a
great
extent
that
of
a
certain
clash
of
human
temperaments
undignified
as
such
a
treatment
may
seem
to
some
of
my
colleagues
i
shall
have
to
take
account
of
this
clash
and
explain
a
good
many
of
the
divergencies
of
philosophers
by
it
of
whatever
temperament
a
professional
philosopher
is
he
tries
when
philosophizing
to
sink
the
fact
of
his
temperament
temperament
is
no
conventionally
recognized
reason
so
he
urges
impersonal
reasons
only
for
his
conclusions
yet
his
temperament
really
gives
him
a
stronger
bias
than
any
of
his
more
strictly
objective
premises
it
loads
the
evidence
for
him
one
way
or
the
other
making
for
a
more
sentimental
or
a
more
view
of
the
universe
just
as
this
fact
or
that
principle
would
he
trusts
his
temperament
wanting
a
universe
that
suits
it
he
believes
in
any
representation
of
the
universe
that
does
suit
it
he
feels
men
of
opposite
temper
to
be
out
of
key
with
the
character
and
in
his
heart
considers
them
incompetent
and
in
it
in
the
philosophic
business
even
tho
they
may
far
excel
him
in
dialectical
ability
yet
in
the
forum
he
can
make
no
claim
on
the
bare
ground
of
his
temperament
to
superior
discernment
or
authority
there
arises
thus
a
certain
insincerity
in
our
philosophic
discussions
the
potentest
of
all
our
premises
is
never
mentioned
i
am
sure
it
would
contribute
to
clearness
if
in
these
lectures
we
should
break
this
rule
and
mention
it
and
i
accordingly
feel
free
to
do
so
of
course
i
am
talking
here
of
very
positively
marked
men
men
of
radical
idiosyncracy
who
have
set
their
stamp
and
likeness
on
philosophy
and
figure
in
its
history
plato
locke
hegel
spencer
are
such
temperamental
thinkers
most
of
us
have
of
course
no
very
definite
intellectual
temperament
we
are
a
mixture
of
opposite
ingredients
each
one
present
very
moderately
we
hardly
know
our
own
preferences
in
abstract
matters
some
of
us
are
easily
talked
out
of
them
and
end
by
following
the
fashion
or
taking
up
with
the
beliefs
of
the
most
impressive
philosopher
in
our
neighborhood
whoever
he
may
be
but
the
one
thing
that
has
counted
so
far
in
philosophy
is
that
a
man
should
see
things
see
them
straight
in
his
own
peculiar
way
and
be
dissatisfied
with
any
opposite
way
of
seeing
them
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
this
strong
temperamental
vision
is
from
now
onward
to
count
no
longer
in
the
history
of
man
beliefs
now
the
particular
difference
of
temperament
that
i
have
in
mind
in
making
these
remarks
is
one
that
has
counted
in
literature
art
government
and
manners
as
well
as
in
philosophy
in
manners
we
find
formalists
and
persons
in
government
authoritarians
and
anarchists
in
literature
purists
or
academicals
and
realists
in
art
classics
and
romantics
you
recognize
these
contrasts
as
familiar
well
in
philosophy
we
have
a
very
similar
contrast
expressed
in
the
pair
of
terms
and
meaning
your
lover
of
facts
in
all
their
crude
variety
meaning
your
devotee
to
abstract
and
eternal
principles
no
one
can
live
an
hour
without
both
facts
and
principles
so
it
is
a
difference
rather
of
emphasis
yet
it
breeds
antipathies
of
the
most
pungent
character
between
those
who
lay
the
emphasis
differently
and
we
shall
find
it
extraordinarily
convenient
to
express
a
certain
contrast
in
men
ways
of
taking
their
universe
by
talking
of
the
and
of
the
temper
these
terms
make
the
contrast
simple
and
massive
more
simple
and
massive
than
are
usually
the
men
of
whom
the
terms
are
predicated
for
every
sort
of
permutation
and
combination
is
possible
in
human
nature
and
if
i
now
proceed
to
define
more
fully
what
i
have
in
mind
when
i
speak
of
rationalists
and
empiricists
by
adding
to
each
of
those
titles
some
secondary
qualifying
characteristics
i
beg
you
to
regard
my
conduct
as
to
a
certain
extent
arbitrary
i
select
types
of
combination
that
nature
offers
very
frequently
but
by
no
means
uniformly
and
i
select
them
solely
for
their
convenience
in
helping
me
to
my
ulterior
purpose
of
characterizing
pragmatism
historically
we
find
the
terms
and
used
as
synonyms
of
and
well
nature
seems
to
combine
most
frequently
with
intellectualism
an
idealistic
and
optimistic
tendency
empiricists
on
the
other
hand
are
not
uncommonly
materialistic
and
their
optimism
is
apt
to
be
decidedly
conditional
and
tremulous
rationalism
is
always
monistic
it
starts
from
wholes
and
universals
and
makes
much
of
the
unity
of
things
empiricism
starts
from
the
parts
and
makes
of
the
whole
a
not
averse
therefore
to
calling
itself
pluralistic
rationalism
usually
considers
itself
more
religious
than
empiricism
but
there
is
much
to
say
about
this
claim
so
i
merely
mention
it
it
is
a
true
claim
when
the
individual
rationalist
is
what
is
called
a
man
of
feeling
and
when
the
individual
empiricist
prides
himself
on
being
in
that
case
the
rationalist
will
usually
also
be
in
favor
of
what
is
called
and
the
empiricist
will
be
a
fatalist
i
use
the
terms
most
popularly
current
the
rationalist
finally
will
be
of
dogmatic
temper
in
his
affirmations
while
the
empiricist
may
be
more
sceptical
and
open
to
discussion
i
will
write
these
traits
down
in
two
columns
i
think
you
will
practically
recognize
the
two
types
of
mental
that
i
mean
if
i
head
the
columns
by
the
titles
and
respectively
the
rationalistic
going
by
intellectualistic
idealistic
optimistic
religious
monistic
dogmatical
the
empiricist
going
by
sensationalistic
materialistic
pessimistic
irreligious
fatalistic
pluralistic
sceptical
pray
postpone
for
a
moment
the
question
whether
the
two
contrasted
mixtures
which
i
have
written
down
are
each
inwardly
coherent
and
or
not
i
shall
very
soon
have
a
good
deal
to
say
on
that
point
it
suffices
for
our
immediate
purpose
that
and
people
characterized
as
i
have
written
them
down
do
both
exist
each
of
you
probably
knows
some
example
of
each
type
and
you
know
what
each
example
thinks
of
the
example
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
they
have
a
low
opinion
of
each
other
their
antagonism
whenever
as
individuals
their
temperaments
have
been
intense
has
formed
in
all
ages
a
part
of
the
philosophic
atmosphere
of
the
time
it
forms
a
part
of
the
philosophic
atmosphere
the
tough
think
of
the
tender
as
sentimentalists
and
the
tender
feel
the
tough
to
be
unrefined
callous
or
brutal
their
mutual
reaction
is
very
much
like
that
that
takes
place
when
bostonian
tourists
mingle
with
a
population
like
that
of
cripple
creek
each
type
believes
the
other
to
be
inferior
to
itself
but
disdain
in
the
one
case
is
mingled
with
amusement
in
the
other
it
has
a
dash
of
fear
now
as
i
have
already
insisted
few
of
us
are
bostonians
pure
and
simple
and
few
are
typical
rocky
mountain
toughs
in
philosophy
most
of
us
have
a
hankering
for
the
good
things
on
both
sides
of
the
line
facts
are
good
of
course
give
us
lots
of
facts
principles
are
good
give
us
plenty
of
principles
the
world
is
indubitably
one
if
you
look
at
it
in
one
way
but
as
indubitably
is
it
many
if
you
look
at
it
in
another
it
is
both
one
and
many
let
us
adopt
a
sort
of
pluralistic
monism
everything
of
course
is
necessarily
determined
and
yet
of
course
our
wills
are
free
a
sort
of
determinism
is
the
true
philosophy
the
evil
of
the
parts
is
undeniable
but
the
whole
ca
be
evil
so
practical
pessimism
may
be
combined
with
metaphysical
optimism
and
so
forth
your
ordinary
philosophic
layman
never
being
a
radical
never
straightening
out
his
system
but
living
vaguely
in
one
plausible
compartment
of
it
or
another
to
suit
the
temptations
of
successive
hours
but
some
of
us
are
more
than
mere
laymen
in
philosophy
we
are
worthy
of
the
name
of
amateur
athletes
and
are
vexed
by
too
much
inconsistency
and
vacillation
in
our
creed
we
can
not
preserve
a
good
intellectual
conscience
so
long
as
we
keep
mixing
incompatibles
from
opposite
sides
of
the
line
and
now
i
come
to
the
first
positively
important
point
which
i
wish
to
make
never
were
as
many
men
of
a
decidedly
empiricist
proclivity
in
existence
as
there
are
at
the
present
day
our
children
one
may
say
are
almost
born
scientific
but
our
esteem
for
facts
has
not
neutralized
in
us
all
religiousness
it
is
itself
almost
religious
our
scientific
temper
is
devout
now
take
a
man
of
this
type
and
let
him
be
also
a
philosophic
amateur
unwilling
to
mix
a
system
after
the
fashion
of
a
common
layman
and
what
does
he
find
his
situation
to
be
in
this
blessed
year
of
our
lord
he
wants
facts
he
wants
science
but
he
also
wants
a
religion
and
being
an
amateur
and
not
an
independent
originator
in
philosophy
he
naturally
looks
for
guidance
to
the
experts
and
professionals
whom
he
finds
already
in
the
field
a
very
large
number
of
you
here
present
possibly
a
majority
of
you
are
amateurs
of
just
this
sort
now
what
kinds
of
philosophy
do
you
find
actually
offered
to
meet
your
need
you
find
an
empirical
philosophy
that
is
not
religious
enough
and
a
religious
philosophy
that
is
not
empirical
enough
for
your
purpose
if
you
look
to
the
quarter
where
facts
are
most
considered
you
find
the
whole
program
in
operation
and
the
between
science
and
religion
in
full
blast
either
it
is
that
rocky
mountain
tough
of
a
haeckel
with
his
materialistic
monism
his
and
his
jest
at
your
god
as
a
vertebrate
or
it
is
spencer
treating
the
world
history
as
a
redistribution
of
matter
and
motion
solely
and
bowing
religion
politely
out
at
the
front
door
she
may
indeed
continue
to
exist
but
she
must
never
show
her
face
inside
the
temple
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
past
the
progress
of
science
has
seemed
to
mean
the
enlargement
of
the
material
universe
and
the
diminution
of
importance
the
result
is
what
one
may
call
the
growth
of
naturalistic
or
positivistic
feeling
man
is
no
to
nature
he
is
an
absorber
she
it
is
who
stands
firm
he
it
is
who
must
accommodate
himself
let
him
record
truth
inhuman
tho
it
be
and
submit
to
it
the
romantic
spontaneity
and
courage
are
gone
the
vision
is
materialistic
and
depressing
ideals
appear
as
inert
of
physiology
what
is
higher
is
explained
by
what
is
lower
and
treated
forever
as
a
case
of
but
nothing
but
something
else
of
a
quite
inferior
sort
you
get
in
short
a
materialistic
universe
in
which
only
the
find
themselves
congenially
at
home
if
now
on
the
other
hand
you
turn
to
the
religious
quarter
for
consolation
and
take
counsel
of
the
philosophies
what
do
you
find
religious
philosophy
in
our
day
and
generation
is
among
us
people
of
two
main
types
one
of
these
is
more
radical
and
aggressive
the
other
has
more
the
air
of
fighting
a
slow
retreat
by
the
more
radical
wing
of
religious
philosophy
i
mean
the
transcendental
idealism
of
the
school
the
philosophy
of
such
men
as
green
the
cairds
bosanquet
and
royce
this
philosophy
has
greatly
influenced
the
more
studious
members
of
our
protestant
ministry
it
is
pantheistic
and
undoubtedly
it
has
already
blunted
the
edge
of
the
traditional
theism
in
protestantism
at
large
that
theism
remains
however
it
is
the
lineal
descendant
through
one
stage
of
concession
after
another
of
the
dogmatic
scholastic
theism
still
taught
rigorously
in
the
seminaries
of
the
catholic
church
for
a
long
time
it
used
to
be
called
among
us
the
philosophy
of
the
scottish
school
it
is
what
i
meant
by
the
philosophy
that
has
the
air
of
fighting
a
slow
retreat
between
the
encroachments
of
the
hegelians
and
other
philosophers
of
the
on
the
one
hand
and
those
of
the
scientific
evolutionists
and
agnostics
on
the
other
the
men
that
give
us
this
kind
of
a
philosophy
james
martineau
professor
bowne
professor
ladd
and
others
must
feel
themselves
rather
tightly
squeezed
and
candid
as
you
like
this
philosophy
is
not
radical
in
temper
it
is
eclectic
a
thing
of
compromises
that
seeks
a
modus
vivendi
above
all
things
it
accepts
the
facts
of
darwinism
the
facts
of
cerebral
physiology
but
it
does
nothing
active
or
enthusiastic
with
them
it
lacks
the
victorious
and
aggressive
note
it
lacks
prestige
in
consequence
whereas
absolutism
has
a
certain
prestige
due
to
the
more
radical
style
of
it
these
two
systems
are
what
you
have
to
choose
between
if
you
turn
to
the
school
and
if
you
are
the
lovers
of
facts
i
have
supposed
you
to
be
you
find
the
trail
of
the
serpent
of
rationalism
of
intellectualism
over
everything
that
lies
on
that
side
of
the
line
you
escape
indeed
the
materialism
that
goes
with
the
reigning
empiricism
but
you
pay
for
your
escape
by
losing
contact
with
the
concrete
parts
of
life
the
more
absolutistic
philosophers
dwell
on
so
high
a
level
of
abstraction
that
they
never
even
try
to
come
down
the
absolute
mind
which
they
offer
us
the
mind
that
makes
our
universe
by
thinking
it
might
for
aught
they
show
us
to
the
contrary
have
made
any
one
of
a
million
other
universes
just
as
well
as
this
you
can
deduce
no
single
actual
particular
from
the
notion
of
it
it
is
compatible
with
any
state
of
things
whatever
being
true
here
below
and
the
theistic
god
is
almost
as
sterile
a
principle
you
have
to
go
to
the
world
which
he
has
created
to
get
any
inkling
of
his
actual
character
he
is
the
kind
of
god
that
has
once
for
all
made
that
kind
of
a
world
the
god
of
the
theistic
writers
lives
on
as
purely
abstract
heights
as
does
the
absolute
absolutism
has
a
certain
sweep
and
dash
about
it
while
the
usual
theism
is
more
insipid
but
both
are
equally
remote
and
vacuous
what
you
want
is
a
philosophy
that
will
not
only
exercise
your
powers
of
intellectual
abstraction
but
that
will
make
some
positive
connexion
with
this
actual
world
of
finite
human
lives
you
want
a
system
that
will
combine
both
things
the
scientific
loyalty
to
facts
and
willingness
to
take
account
of
them
the
spirit
of
adaptation
and
accommodation
in
short
but
also
the
old
confidence
in
human
values
and
the
resultant
spontaneity
whether
of
the
religious
or
of
the
romantic
type
and
this
is
then
your
dilemma
you
find
the
two
parts
of
your
quaesitum
hopelessly
separated
you
find
empiricism
with
inhumanism
and
irreligion
or
else
you
find
a
rationalistic
philosophy
that
indeed
may
call
itself
religious
but
that
keeps
out
of
all
definite
touch
with
concrete
facts
and
joys
and
sorrows
i
am
not
sure
how
many
of
you
live
close
enough
to
philosophy
to
realize
fully
what
i
mean
by
this
last
reproach
so
i
will
dwell
a
little
longer
on
that
unreality
in
all
rationalistic
systems
by
which
your
serious
believer
in
facts
is
so
apt
to
feel
repelled
i
wish
that
i
had
saved
the
first
couple
of
pages
of
a
thesis
which
a
student
handed
me
a
year
or
two
ago
they
illustrated
my
point
so
clearly
that
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
read
them
to
you
now
this
young
man
who
was
a
graduate
of
some
western
college
began
by
saying
that
he
had
always
taken
for
granted
that
when
you
entered
a
philosophic
you
had
to
open
relations
with
a
universe
entirely
distinct
from
the
one
you
left
behind
you
in
the
street
the
two
were
supposed
he
said
to
have
so
little
to
do
with
each
other
that
you
could
not
possibly
occupy
your
mind
with
them
at
the
same
time
the
world
of
concrete
personal
experiences
to
which
the
street
belongs
is
multitudinous
beyond
imagination
tangled
muddy
painful
and
perplexed
the
world
to
which
your
introduces
you
is
simple
clean
and
noble
the
contradictions
of
real
life
are
absent
from
it
its
architecture
is
classic
principles
of
reason
trace
its
outlines
logical
necessities
cement
its
parts
purity
and
dignity
are
what
it
most
expresses
it
is
a
kind
of
marble
temple
shining
on
a
hill
in
point
of
fact
it
is
far
less
an
account
of
this
actual
world
than
a
clear
addition
built
upon
it
a
classic
sanctuary
in
which
the
rationalist
fancy
may
take
refuge
from
the
intolerably
confused
and
gothic
character
which
mere
facts
present
it
is
no
explanation
of
our
concrete
universe
it
is
another
thing
altogether
a
substitute
for
it
a
remedy
a
way
of
escape
its
temperament
if
i
may
use
the
word
temperament
here
is
utterly
alien
to
the
temperament
of
existence
in
the
concrete
refinement
is
what
characterizes
our
intellectualist
philosophies
they
exquisitely
satisfy
that
craving
for
a
refined
object
of
contemplation
which
is
so
powerful
an
appetite
of
the
mind
but
i
ask
you
in
all
seriousness
to
look
abroad
on
this
colossal
universe
of
concrete
facts
on
their
awful
bewilderments
their
surprises
and
cruelties
on
the
wildness
which
they
show
and
then
to
tell
me
whether
is
the
one
inevitable
descriptive
adjective
that
springs
to
your
lips
refinement
has
its
place
in
things
true
enough
but
a
philosophy
that
breathes
out
nothing
but
refinement
will
never
satisfy
the
empiricist
temper
of
mind
it
will
seem
rather
a
monument
of
artificiality
so
we
find
men
of
science
preferring
to
turn
their
backs
on
metaphysics
as
on
something
altogether
cloistered
and
spectral
and
practical
men
shaking
philosophy
dust
off
their
feet
and
following
the
call
of
the
wild
truly
there
is
something
a
little
ghastly
in
the
satisfaction
with
which
a
pure
but
unreal
system
will
fill
a
rationalist
mind
leibnitz
was
a
rationalist
mind
with
infinitely
more
interest
in
facts
than
most
rationalist
minds
can
show
yet
if
you
wish
for
superficiality
incarnate
you
have
only
to
read
that
charmingly
written
of
his
in
which
he
sought
to
justify
the
ways
of
god
to
man
and
to
prove
that
the
world
we
live
in
is
the
best
of
possible
worlds
let
me
quote
a
specimen
of
what
i
mean
among
other
obstacles
to
his
optimistic
philosophy
it
falls
to
leibnitz
to
consider
the
number
of
the
eternally
damned
that
it
is
infinitely
greater
in
our
human
case
than
that
of
those
saved
he
assumes
as
a
premise
from
the
theologians
and
then
proceeds
to
argue
in
this
way
even
then
he
says
the
evil
will
appear
as
almost
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
good
if
we
once
consider
the
real
magnitude
of
the
city
of
god
coelius
secundus
curio
has
written
a
little
book
amplitudine
regni
coelestis
which
was
reprinted
not
long
ago
but
he
failed
to
compass
the
extent
of
the
kingdom
of
the
heavens
the
ancients
had
small
ideas
of
the
works
of
god
it
seemed
to
them
that
only
our
earth
had
inhabitants
and
even
the
notion
of
our
antipodes
gave
them
pause
the
rest
of
the
world
for
them
consisted
of
some
shining
globes
and
a
few
crystalline
spheres
but
whatever
be
the
limits
that
we
may
grant
or
refuse
to
the
universe
we
must
recognize
in
it
a
countless
number
of
globes
as
big
as
ours
or
bigger
which
have
just
as
much
right
as
it
has
to
support
rational
inhabitants
tho
it
does
not
follow
that
these
need
all
be
men
our
earth
is
only
one
among
the
six
principal
satellites
of
our
sun
as
all
the
fixed
stars
are
suns
one
sees
how
small
a
place
among
visible
things
our
earth
takes
up
since
it
is
only
a
satellite
of
one
among
them
now
all
these
suns
may
be
inhabited
by
none
but
happy
creatures
and
nothing
obliges
us
to
believe
that
the
number
of
damned
persons
is
very
great
for
a
very
few
instances
and
samples
suffice
for
the
utility
which
good
draws
from
evil
moreover
since
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
there
are
stars
everywhere
may
there
not
be
a
great
space
beyond
the
region
of
the
stars
and
this
immense
space
surrounding
all
this
region
may
be
replete
with
happiness
and
glory
what
now
becomes
of
the
consideration
of
our
earth
and
of
its
denizens
does
it
not
dwindle
to
something
incomparably
less
than
a
physical
point
since
our
earth
is
but
a
point
compared
with
the
distance
of
the
fixed
stars
thus
the
part
of
the
universe
which
we
know
being
almost
lost
in
nothingness
compared
with
that
which
is
unknown
to
us
but
which
we
are
yet
obliged
to
admit
and
all
the
evils
that
we
know
lying
in
this
it
follows
that
the
evils
may
be
in
comparison
with
the
goods
that
the
universe
contains
leibnitz
continues
elsewhere
there
is
a
kind
of
justice
which
aims
neither
at
the
amendment
of
the
criminal
nor
at
furnishing
an
example
to
others
nor
at
the
reparation
of
the
injury
this
justice
is
founded
in
pure
fitness
which
finds
a
certain
satisfaction
in
the
expiation
of
a
wicked
deed
the
socinians
and
hobbes
objected
to
this
punitive
justice
which
is
properly
vindictive
justice
and
which
god
has
reserved
for
himself
at
many
junctures
it
is
always
founded
in
the
fitness
of
things
and
satisfies
not
only
the
offended
party
but
all
wise
even
as
beautiful
music
or
a
fine
piece
of
architecture
satisfies
a
mind
it
is
thus
that
the
torments
of
the
damned
continue
even
tho
they
serve
no
longer
to
turn
anyone
away
from
sin
and
that
the
rewards
of
the
blest
continue
even
tho
they
confirm
no
one
in
good
ways
the
damned
draw
to
themselves
ever
new
penalties
by
their
continuing
sins
and
the
blest
attract
ever
fresh
joys
by
their
unceasing
progress
in
good
both
facts
are
founded
on
the
principle
of
fitness

as
i
have
already
said
leibnitz
feeble
grasp
of
reality
is
too
obvious
to
need
comment
from
me
it
is
evident
that
no
realistic
image
of
the
experience
of
a
damned
soul
had
ever
approached
the
portals
of
his
mind
nor
had
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
smaller
is
the
number
of
of
the
genus
whom
god
throws
as
a
sop
to
the
eternal
fitness
the
more
unequitably
grounded
is
the
glory
of
the
blest
what
he
gives
us
is
a
cold
literary
exercise
whose
cheerful
substance
even
does
not
warm
and
do
not
tell
me
that
to
show
the
shallowness
of
rationalist
philosophizing
i
have
had
to
go
back
to
a
shallow
wigpated
age
the
optimism
of
rationalism
sounds
just
as
shallow
to
the
mind
the
actual
universe
is
a
thing
wide
open
but
rationalism
makes
systems
and
systems
must
be
closed
for
men
in
practical
life
perfection
is
something
far
off
and
still
in
process
of
achievement
this
for
rationalism
is
but
the
illusion
of
the
finite
and
relative
the
absolute
ground
of
things
is
a
perfection
eternally
complete
i
find
a
fine
example
of
revolt
against
the
airy
and
shallow
optimism
of
current
religious
philosophy
in
a
publication
of
that

anarchism
goes
a

i
confess
that
i
sympathize
a
good
deal
and
some
of
you
i
know
will
sympathize
heartily
with
his
dissatisfaction
with
the
idealistic
optimisms
now
in
vogue
he
begins
his

with
a
series
of
city
items
from
newspapers
suicides
deaths
from
starvation
and
the
like
as
specimens
of
our
civilized
regime
for
instance
trudging
through
the
snow
from
one
end
of
the
city
to
the
other
in
the
vain
hope
of
securing
employment
and
with
his

and

he

he

says

appearance

he
means
that
these

and
that
is

but
while

royce

and
a

of
guileless

are
unveiling
reality
and
the

this

of
what
the

is
what
these

experience

it
gives
us
an
absolute
phase
of
the

it
is
the
personal
experience
of
those
most
qualified
in

to
have

tell
us
what

what

and
of
the
proprietary
of
the
great
mass
of

is
coming
to
this
view
they
are
judging
the

they

heretofore
permitted

judge
them
this

by

it

what
it
blazons

is
the
imposture
of
all
philosophy
which
does
not
see

in

it
is
at
this
point
that
my
own
solution
begins
to
appear
i
offer
the
thing
pragmatism
as
a
philosophy
that
can
satisfy
both
kinds
of
demand
it
can
remain
religious
like
the
rationalisms
but
at
the
same
time
like
the
empiricisms
it
can
preserve
the
richest
intimacy
with
facts
i
hope
i
may
be
able
to
leave
many
of
you
with
as
favorable
an
opinion
of
it
as
i
preserve
myself
yet
as
i
am
near
the
end
of

hour
i
will
not
introduce
pragmatism
bodily
now
i
will
begin
with
it
on
the
stroke
of
the
clock
next
time
i
prefer
at
the
present
moment
to
return
a
little
on
what
i
have
said
if
any
of
you
here
are
professional
philosophers
and
some
of
you
i
know
to
be
such
you
will
doubtless
have
felt
my
discourse
so
far
to
have
been
crude
in
an
unpardonable
nay
in
an
almost
incredible
degree
and
what
a
barbaric
disjunction
and
in
general
when
philosophy
is
all
compacted
of
delicate
intellectualities
and
subtleties
and
scrupulosities
and
when
every
possible
sort
of
combination
and
transition
obtains
within
its
bounds
what
a
brutal
caricature
and
reduction
of
highest
things
to
the
lowest
possible
expression
is
it
to
represent
its
field
of
conflict
as
a
sort
of
fight
between
two
hostile
temperaments
what
a
childishly
external
view
and
again
how
stupid
it
is
to
treat
the
abstractness
of
rationalist
systems
as
a
crime
and
to
damn
them
because
they
offer
themselves
as
sanctuaries
and
places
of
escape
rather
than
as
prolongations
of
the
world
of
facts
are
not
all
our
theories
just
remedies
and
places
of
escape
and
if
philosophy
is
to
be
religious
how
can
she
be
anything
else
than
a
place
of
escape
from
the
crassness
of
reality
surface
what
better
thing
can
she
do
than
raise
us
out
of
our
animal
senses
and
show
us
another
and
a
nobler
home
for
our
minds
in
that
great
framework
of
ideal
principles
subtending
all
reality
which
the
intellect
divines
how
can
principles
and
general
views
ever
be
anything
but
abstract
outlines

an

is
concrete
rudeness
the
only
thing
that
true
believe
me
i
feel
the
full
force
of
the
indictment
the
picture
i
have
given
is
indeed
monstrously
and
rude
but
like
all
abstractions
it
will
prove
to
have
its
use
if
philosophers
can
treat
the
life
of
the
universe
abstractly
they
must
not
complain
of
an
abstract
treatment
of
the
life
of
philosophy
itself
in
point
of
fact
the
picture
i
have
given
is
however
coarse
and
sketchy
literally
true
temperaments
with
their
cravings
and
refusals
do
determine
men
in
their
philosophies
and
always
will
the
details
of
systems
may
be
reasoned
out
piecemeal
and
when
the
student
is
working
at
a
system
he
may
often
forget
the
forest
for
the
single
tree
but
when
the
labor
is
accomplished
the
mind
always
performs
its
big
summarizing
act
and
the
system
forthwith
stands
over
against
one
like
a
living
thing
with
that
strange
simple
note
of
individuality
which
haunts
our
memory
like
the
wraith
of
the
man

a
friend
or
enemy
of
ours
is
dead
not
only

could
write

the
books
of
all
the
great
philosophers
are
like
so
many
men
our
sense
of
an
essential
personal
flavor
in
each
one
of
them
typical
but
indescribable
is
the
finest
fruit
of
our
own
accomplished
philosophic
education
what
the
system
pretends
to
be
is
a
picture
of
the
great
universe
of
god
what
it
is
and
oh
so
flagrantly
is
the
revelation
of
how
intensely
odd
the
personal
flavor
of
some
fellow
creature
is
once
reduced
to
these
terms
and
all
our
philosophies
get
reduced
to
them
in
minds
made
critical
by
learning
our
commerce
with
the
systems
reverts
to
the
informal
to
the
instinctive
human
reaction
of
satisfaction
or
dislike
we
grow
as
peremptory
in
our
rejection
or
admission
as
when
a
person
presents
himself
as
a
candidate
for
our
favor
our
verdicts
are
couched
in
as
simple
adjectives
of
praise
or
dispraise
we
measure
the
total
character
of
the
universe
as
we
feel
it
against
the
flavor
of
the
philosophy
proffered
us
and
one
word
is
enough

impossible
our
work
over
the
details
of
his
system
is
indeed
what
gives
us
our
resultant
impression
of
the
philosopher
but
it
is
on
the
resultant
impression
itself
that
we
react
expertness
in
philosophy
is
measured
by
the
definiteness
of
our
summarizing
reactions
by
the
immediate
perceptive
epithet
with
which
the
expert
hits
such
complex
objects
off
but
great
expertness
is
not
necessary
for
the
epithet
to
come
few
people
have
definitely
articulated
philosophies
of
their
own
but
almost
everyone
has
his
own
peculiar
sense
of
a
certain
total
character
in
the
universe
and
of
the
inadequacy
fully
to
match
it

the
peculiar
systems

offhand
that

are

with

i
repeat
it
will
be
by
them
that
all

shall
ultimately
be

way
of
looking
at

will
be
the
most
completely
impressive
way
to
the
normal
run
of
minds
one
word
more
namely
about
philosophies
necessarily
being
abstract
outlines
there
are
outlines
and
outlines
outlines
of
buildings
that
are
fat
conceived
in
the
cube
by
their
planner
and
outlines
of
buildings
invented
flat
on
paper
with
the
aid
of
ruler
and
compass
these
remain
skinny
and
emaciated
even
when
set
up
in
stone
and
mortar
and
the
outline
already
suggests
that
result
an
outline
in
itself
is
meagre
truly
but
it
does
not
necessarily
suggest
a
meagre
thing
it
is
the
essential
meagreness
of
what
is
suggested
by
the
usual
rationalistic
philosophies
that
moves
empiricists
to
their
gesture
of
rejection
the
case
of
herbert
spencer
system
is
much
to
the
point
here
rationalists
feel
his
fearful
array
of
insufficiencies
his
dry
schoolmaster
temperament
the
monotony
of
him
his
preference
for
cheap
makeshifts
in
argument
his
lack
of
education
even
in
mechanical
principles
and
in
general
the
vagueness
of
all
his
fundamental
ideas
his
whole
system
wooden
as
if
knocked
together
out
of
cracked
hemlock
boards
and
yet
the
half
of
england
wants
to
bury
him
in
westminster
abbey
why
why
does
spencer
call
out
so
much
reverence
in
spite
of
his
weakness
in
rationalistic
eyes
why
should
so
many
educated
men
who
feel
that
weakness
you
and
i
perhaps
wish
to
see
him
in
the
abbey
notwithstanding
simply
because
we
feel
his
heart
to
be
in
the
right
place
philosophically
his
principles
may
be
all
skin
and
bone
but
at
any
rate
his
books
try
to
mould
themselves
upon
the
particular
shape
of
this
particular
world
carcase
the
noise
of
facts
resounds
through
all
his
chapters
the
citations
of
fact
never
cease
he
emphasizes
facts
turns
his
face
towards
their
quarter
and
that
is
enough
it
means
the
right
kind
of
thing
for
the
empiricist
mind
the
pragmatistic
philosophy
of
which
i
hope
to
begin
talking
in
my
next
lecture
preserves
as
cordial
a
relation
with
facts
and
unlike
spencer
philosophy
it
neither
begins
nor
ends
by
turning
positive
religious
constructions
out
of
doors
it
treats
them
cordially
as
well
i
hope
i
may
lead
you
to
find
it
just
the
mediating
way
of
thinking
that
you
require
lecture
ii
what
pragmatism
means
some
years
ago
being
with
a
camping
party
in
the
mountains
i
returned
from
a
solitary
ramble
to
find
everyone
engaged
in
a
ferocious
metaphysical
dispute
the
corpus
of
the
dispute
was
a
squirrel
a
live
squirrel
supposed
to
be
clinging
to
one
side
of
a
while
over
against
the
tree
opposite
side
a
human
being
was
imagined
to
stand
this
human
witness
tries
to
get
sight
of
the
squirrel
by
moving
rapidly
round
the
tree
but
no
matter
how
fast
he
goes
the
squirrel
moves
as
fast
in
the
opposite
direction
and
always
keeps
the
tree
between
himself
and
the
man
so
that
never
a
glimpse
of
him
is
caught
the
resultant
metaphysical
problem
now
is
this
does
the
man
go
round
the
squirrel
or
not
he
goes
round
the
tree
sure
enough
and
the
squirrel
is
on
the
tree
but
does
he
go
round
the
squirrel
in
the
unlimited
leisure
of
the
wilderness
discussion
had
been
worn
threadbare
everyone
had
taken
sides
and
was
obstinate
and
the
numbers
on
both
sides
were
even
each
side
when
i
appeared
therefore
appealed
to
me
to
make
it
a
majority
mindful
of
the
scholastic
adage
that
whenever
you
meet
a
contradiction
you
must
make
a
distinction
i
immediately
sought
and
found
one
as
follows
which
party
is
right
i
said
depends
on
what
you
practically
mean
by
round
the
squirrel
if
you
mean
passing
from
the
north
of
him
to
the
east
then
to
the
south
then
to
the
west
and
then
to
the
north
of
him
again
obviously
the
man
does
go
round
him
for
he
occupies
these
successive
positions
but
if
on
the
contrary
you
mean
being
first
in
front
of
him
then
on
the
right
of
him
then
behind
him
then
on
his
left
and
finally
in
front
again
it
is
quite
as
obvious
that
the
man
fails
to
go
round
him
for
by
the
compensating
movements
the
squirrel
makes
he
keeps
his
belly
turned
towards
the
man
all
the
time
and
his
back
turned
away
make
the
distinction
and
there
is
no
occasion
for
any
farther
dispute
you
are
both
right
and
both
wrong
according
as
you
conceive
the
verb
go
round
in
one
practical
fashion
or
the
other
altho
one
or
two
of
the
hotter
disputants
called
my
speech
a
shuffling
evasion
saying
they
wanted
no
quibbling
or
scholastic
but
meant
just
plain
honest
english
the
majority
seemed
to
think
that
the
distinction
had
assuaged
the
dispute
i
tell
this
trivial
anecdote
because
it
is
a
peculiarly
simple
example
of
what
i
wish
now
to
speak
of
as
the
pragmatic
method
the
pragmatic
method
is
primarily
a
method
of
settling
metaphysical
disputes
that
otherwise
might
be
interminable
is
the
world
one
or
many
fated
or
free
material
or
spiritual
here
are
notions
either
of
which
may
or
may
not
hold
good
of
the
world
and
disputes
over
such
notions
are
unending
the
pragmatic
method
in
such
cases
is
to
try
to
interpret
each
notion
by
tracing
its
respective
practical
consequences
what
difference
would
it
practically
make
to
anyone
if
this
notion
rather
than
that
notion
were
true
if
no
practical
difference
whatever
can
be
traced
then
the
alternatives
mean
practically
the
same
thing
and
all
dispute
is
idle
whenever
a
dispute
is
serious
we
ought
to
be
able
to
show
some
practical
difference
that
must
follow
from
one
side
or
the
other
being
right
a
glance
at
the
history
of
the
idea
will
show
you
still
better
what
pragmatism
means
the
term
is
derived
from
the
same
greek
word
pi
rho
alpha
gamma
mu
alpha
meaning
action
from
which
our
words
and
come
it
was
first
introduced
into
philosophy
by
charles
peirce
in
in
an
article
entitled
to
make
our
ideas
clear
in
the
science
monthly
for
january
of
that
year
footnote
translated
in
the
revue
philosophique
for
january
vol
vii
peirce
after
pointing
out
that
our
beliefs
are
really
rules
for
action
said
that
to
develope
a
thought
meaning
we
need
only
determine
what
conduct
it
is
fitted
to
produce
that
conduct
is
for
us
its
sole
significance
and
the
tangible
fact
at
the
root
of
all
our
however
subtle
is
that
there
is
no
one
of
them
so
fine
as
to
consist
in
anything
but
a
possible
difference
of
practice
to
attain
perfect
clearness
in
our
thoughts
of
an
object
then
we
need
only
consider
what
conceivable
effects
of
a
practical
kind
the
object
may
involve
what
sensations
we
are
to
expect
from
it
and
what
reactions
we
must
prepare
our
conception
of
these
effects
whether
immediate
or
remote
is
then
for
us
the
whole
of
our
conception
of
the
object
so
far
as
that
conception
has
positive
significance
at
all
this
is
the
principle
of
peirce
the
principle
of
pragmatism
it
lay
entirely
unnoticed
by
anyone
for
twenty
years
until
i
in
an
address
before
professor
howison
philosophical
union
at
the
university
of
california
brought
it
forward
again
and
made
a
special
application
of
it
to
religion
by
that
date
the
times
seemed
ripe
for
its
reception
the
word
spread
and
at
present
it
fairly
spots
the
pages
of
the
philosophic
journals
on
all
hands
we
find
the
movement
spoken
of
sometimes
with
respect
sometimes
with
contumely
seldom
with
clear
understanding
it
is
evident
that
the
term
applies
itself
conveniently
to
a
number
of
tendencies
that
hitherto
have
lacked
a
collective
name
and
that
it
has
to
stay
to
take
in
the
importance
of
peirce
principle
one
must
get
accustomed
to
applying
it
to
concrete
cases
i
found
a
few
years
ago
that
ostwald
the
illustrious
leipzig
chemist
had
been
making
perfectly
distinct
use
of
the
principle
of
pragmatism
in
his
lectures
on
the
philosophy
of
science
tho
he
had
not
called
it
by
that
name
all
realities
influence
our
practice
he
wrote
me
and
that
influence
is
their
meaning
for
us
i
am
accustomed
to
put
questions
to
my
classes
in
this
way
in
what
respects
would
the
world
be
different
if
this
alternative
or
that
were
true
if
i
can
find
nothing
that
would
become
different
then
the
alternative
has
no
sense
that
is
the
rival
views
mean
practically
the
same
thing
and
meaning
other
than
practical
there
is
for
us
none
ostwald
in
a
published
lecture
gives
this
example
of
what
he
means
chemists
have
long
wrangled
over
the
inner
constitution
of
certain
bodies
called
their
properties
seemed
equally
consistent
with
the
notion
that
an
instable
hydrogen
atom
oscillates
inside
of
them
or
that
they
are
instable
mixtures
of
two
bodies
controversy
raged
but
never
was
decided
it
would
never
have
begun
says
ostwald
if
the
combatants
had
asked
themselves
what
particular
experimental
fact
could
have
been
made
different
by
one
or
the
other
view
being
correct
for
it
would
then
have
appeared
that
no
difference
of
fact
could
possibly
ensue
and
the
quarrel
was
as
unreal
as
if
theorizing
in
primitive
times
about
the
raising
of
dough
by
yeast
one
party
should
have
invoked
a
while
another
insisted
on
an
as
the
true
cause
of
the

u
i
find
a
still
more
radical
pragmatism
than
ostwald
in
an
address
by
professor
franklin
i
think
that
the
sickliest
notion
of
physics
even
if
a
student
gets
it
is
that
it
is
science
of
masses
molecules
and
the
ether
and
i
think
that
the
healthiest
notion
even
if
a
student
does
not
wholly
get
it
is
that
physics
is
the
science
of
the
ways
of
taking
hold
of
bodies
and
pushing
them
science
january
it
is
astonishing
to
see
how
many
philosophical
disputes
collapse
into
insignificance
the
moment
you
subject
them
to
this
simple
test
of
tracing
a
concrete
consequence
there
can
be
no
difference
that
does
make
a
difference
elsewhere
no
difference
in
abstract
truth
that
does
express
itself
in
a
difference
in
concrete
fact
and
in
conduct
consequent
upon
that
fact
imposed
on
somebody
somehow
somewhere
and
somewhen
the
whole
function
of
philosophy
ought
to
be
to
find
out
what
definite
difference
it
will
make
to
you
and
me
at
definite
instants
of
our
life
if
this
or
that
be
the
true
one
there
is
absolutely
nothing
new
in
the
pragmatic
method
socrates
was
an
adept
at
it
aristotle
used
it
methodically
locke
berkeley
and
hume
made
momentous
contributions
to
truth
by
its
means
shadworth
hodgson
keeps
insisting
that
realities
are
only
what
they
are
but
these
forerunners
of
pragmatism
used
it
in
fragments
they
were
preluders
only
not
until
in
our
time
has
it
generalized
itself
become
conscious
of
a
universal
mission
pretended
to
a
conquering
destiny
i
believe
in
that
destiny
and
i
hope
i
may
end
by
inspiring
you
with
my
belief
pragmatism
represents
a
perfectly
familiar
attitude
in
philosophy
the
empiricist
attitude
but
it
represents
it
as
it
seems
to
me
both
in
a
more
radical
and
in
a
less
objectionable
form
than
it
has
ever
yet
assumed
a
pragmatist
turns
his
back
resolutely
and
once
for
all
upon
a
lot
of
inveterate
habits
dear
to
professional
philosophers
he
turns
away
from
abstraction
and
insufficiency
from
verbal
solutions
from
bad
a
priori
reasons
from
fixed
principles
closed
systems
and
pretended
absolutes
and
origins
he
turns
towards
concreteness
and
adequacy
towards
facts
towards
action
and
towards
power
that
means
the
empiricist
temper
regnant
and
the
rationalist
temper
sincerely
given
up
it
means
the
open
air
and
possibilities
of
nature
as
against
dogma
artificiality
and
the
pretence
of
finality
in
truth
at
the
same
time
it
does
not
stand
for
any
special
results
it
is
a
method
only
but
the
general
triumph
of
that
method
would
mean
an
enormous
change
in
what
i
called
in
my
last
lecture
the
of
philosophy
teachers
of
the
type
would
be
frozen
out
much
as
the
courtier
type
is
frozen
out
in
republics
as
the
ultramontane
type
of
priest
is
frozen
out
in
protestant
lands
science
and
metaphysics
would
come
much
nearer
together
would
in
fact
work
absolutely
hand
in
hand
metaphysics
has
usually
followed
a
very
primitive
kind
of
quest
you
know
how
men
have
always
hankered
after
unlawful
magic
and
you
know
what
a
great
part
in
magic
words
have
always
played
if
you
have
his
name
or
the
formula
of
incantation
that
binds
him
you
can
control
the
spirit
genie
afrite
or
whatever
the
power
may
be
solomon
knew
the
names
of
all
the
spirits
and
having
their
names
he
held
them
subject
to
his
will
so
the
universe
has
always
appeared
to
the
natural
mind
as
a
kind
of
enigma
of
which
the
key
must
be
sought
in
the
shape
of
some
illuminating
or
word
or
name
that
word
names
the
universe
principle
and
to
possess
it
is
after
a
fashion
to
possess
the
universe
itself
absolute
are
so
many
solving
names
you
can
rest
when
you
have
them
you
are
at
the
end
of
your
metaphysical
quest
but
if
you
follow
the
pragmatic
method
you
can
not
look
on
any
such
word
as
closing
your
quest
you
must
bring
out
of
each
word
its
practical
set
it
at
work
within
the
stream
of
your
experience
it
appears
less
as
a
solution
then
than
as
a
program
for
more
work
and
more
particularly
as
an
indication
of
the
ways
in
which
existing
realities
may
be
changed
theories
thus
become
instruments
not
answers
to
enigmas
in
which
we
can
rest
we
do
lie
back
upon
them
we
move
forward
and
on
occasion
make
nature
over
again
by
their
aid
pragmatism
unstiffens
all
our
theories
limbers
them
up
and
sets
each
one
at
work
being
nothing
essentially
new
it
harmonizes
with
many
ancient
philosophic
tendencies
it
agrees
with
nominalism
for
instance
in
always
appealing
to
particulars
with
utilitarianism
in
emphasizing
practical
aspects
with
positivism
in
its
disdain
for
verbal
solutions
useless
questions
and
metaphysical
abstractions
all
these
you
see
are
tendencies
against
rationalism
as
a
pretension
and
a
method
pragmatism
is
fully
armed
and
militant
but
at
the
outset
at
least
it
stands
for
no
particular
results
it
has
no
dogmas
and
no
doctrines
save
its
method
as
the
young
italian
pragmatist
papini
has
well
said
it
lies
in
the
midst
of
our
theories
like
a
corridor
in
a
hotel
innumerable
chambers
open
out
of
it
in
one
you
may
find
a
man
writing
an
atheistic
volume
in
the
next
someone
on
his
knees
praying
for
faith
and
strength
in
a
third
a
chemist
investigating
a
body
properties
in
a
fourth
a
system
of
idealistic
metaphysics
is
being
excogitated
in
a
fifth
the
impossibility
of
metaphysics
is
being
shown
but
they
all
own
the
corridor
and
all
must
pass
through
it
if
they
want
a
practicable
way
of
getting
into
or
out
of
their
respective
rooms
no
particular
results
then
so
far
but
only
an
attitude
of
orientation
is
what
the
pragmatic
method
means
the
attitude
of
looking
away
from
first
things
principles
supposed
necessities
and
of
looking
towards
last
things
fruits
consequences
facts
so
much
for
the
pragmatic
method
you
may
say
that
i
have
been
praising
it
rather
than
explaining
it
to
you
but
i
shall
presently
explain
it
abundantly
enough
by
showing
how
it
works
on
some
familiar
problems
meanwhile
the
word
pragmatism
has
come
to
be
used
in
a
still
wider
sense
as
meaning
also
a
certain
theory
of
truth
i
mean
to
give
a
whole
lecture
to
the
statement
of
that
theory
after
first
paving
the
way
so
i
can
be
very
brief
now
but
brevity
is
hard
to
follow
so
i
ask
for
your
redoubled
attention
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
if
much
remains
obscure
i
hope
to
make
it
clearer
in
the
later
lectures
one
of
the
most
successfully
cultivated
branches
of
philosophy
in
our
time
is
what
is
called
inductive
logic
the
study
of
the
conditions
under
which
our
sciences
have
evolved
writers
on
this
subject
have
begun
to
show
a
singular
unanimity
as
to
what
the
laws
of
nature
and
elements
of
fact
mean
when
formulated
by
mathematicians
physicists
and
chemists
when
the
first
mathematical
logical
and
natural
uniformities
the
first
laws
were
discovered
men
were
so
carried
away
by
the
clearness
beauty
and
simplification
that
resulted
that
they
believed
themselves
to
have
deciphered
authentically
the
eternal
thoughts
of
the
almighty
his
mind
also
thundered
and
reverberated
in
syllogisms
he
also
thought
in
conic
sections
squares
and
roots
and
ratios
and
geometrized
like
euclid
he
made
kepler
laws
for
the
planets
to
follow
he
made
velocity
increase
proportionally
to
the
time
in
falling
bodies
he
made
the
law
of
the
sines
for
light
to
obey
when
refracted
he
established
the
classes
orders
families
and
genera
of
plants
and
animals
and
fixed
the
distances
between
them
he
thought
the
archetypes
of
all
things
and
devised
their
variations
and
when
we
rediscover
any
one
of
these
his
wondrous
institutions
we
seize
his
mind
in
its
very
literal
intention
but
as
the
sciences
have
developed
farther
the
notion
has
gained
ground
that
most
perhaps
all
of
our
laws
are
only
approximations
the
laws
themselves
moreover
have
grown
so
numerous
that
there
is
no
counting
them
and
so
many
rival
formulations
are
proposed
in
all
the
branches
of
science
that
investigators
have
become
accustomed
to
the
notion
that
no
theory
is
absolutely
a
transcript
of
reality
but
that
any
one
of
them
may
from
some
point
of
view
be
useful
their
great
use
is
to
summarize
old
facts
and
to
lead
to
new
ones
they
are
only
a
language
a
conceptual
shorthand
as
someone
calls
them
in
which
we
write
our
reports
of
nature
and
languages
as
is
well
known
tolerate
much
choice
of
expression
and
many
dialects
thus
human
arbitrariness
has
driven
divine
necessity
from
scientific
logic
if
i
mention
the
names
of
sigwart
mach
ostwald
pearson
milhaud
poincare
duhem
ruyssen
those
of
you
who
are
students
will
easily
identify
the
tendency
i
speak
of
and
will
think
of
additional
names
riding
now
on
the
front
of
this
wave
of
scientific
logic
schiller
and
dewey
appear
with
their
pragmatistic
account
of
what
truth
everywhere
signifies
everywhere
these
teachers
say
in
our
ideas
and
beliefs
means
the
same
thing
that
it
means
in
science
it
means
they
say
nothing
but
this
that
ideas
which
themselves
are
but
parts
of
our
experience
become
true
just
in
so
far
as
they
help
us
to
get
into
satisfactory
relation
with
other
parts
of
our
experience
to
summarize
them
and
get
about
among
them
by
conceptual
instead
of
following
the
interminable
succession
of
particular
phenomena
any
idea
upon
which
we
can
ride
so
to
speak
any
idea
that
will
carry
us
prosperously
from
any
one
part
of
our
experience
to
any
other
part
linking
things
satisfactorily
working
securely
simplifying
saving
labor
is
true
for
just
so
much
true
in
so
far
forth
true
instrumentally
this
is
the
view
of
truth
taught
so
successfully
at
chicago
the
view
that
truth
in
our
ideas
means
their
power
to
promulgated
so
brilliantly
at
oxford
dewey
schiller
and
their
allies
in
reaching
this
general
conception
of
all
truth
have
only
followed
the
example
of
geologists
biologists
and
philologists
in
the
establishment
of
these
other
sciences
the
successful
stroke
was
always
to
take
some
simple
process
actually
observable
in
operation
as
denudation
by
weather
say
or
variation
from
parental
type
or
change
of
dialect
by
incorporation
of
new
words
and
pronunciations
and
then
to
generalize
it
making
it
apply
to
all
times
and
produce
great
results
by
summating
its
effects
through
the
ages
the
observable
process
which
schiller
and
dewey
particularly
singled
out
for
generalization
is
the
familiar
one
by
which
any
individual
settles
into
new
opinions
the
process
here
is
always
the
same
the
individual
has
a
stock
of
old
opinions
already
but
he
meets
a
new
experience
that
puts
them
to
a
strain
somebody
contradicts
them
or
in
a
reflective
moment
he
discovers
that
they
contradict
each
other
or
he
hears
of
facts
with
which
they
are
incompatible
or
desires
arise
in
him
which
they
cease
to
satisfy
the
result
is
an
inward
trouble
to
which
his
mind
till
then
had
been
a
stranger
and
from
which
he
seeks
to
escape
by
modifying
his
previous
mass
of
opinions
he
saves
as
much
of
it
as
he
can
for
in
this
matter
of
belief
we
are
all
extreme
conservatives
so
he
tries
to
change
first
this
opinion
and
then
that
for
they
resist
change
very
variously
until
at
last
some
new
idea
comes
up
which
he
can
graft
upon
the
ancient
stock
with
a
minimum
of
disturbance
of
the
latter
some
idea
that
mediates
between
the
stock
and
the
new
experience
and
runs
them
into
one
another
most
felicitously
and
expediently
this
new
idea
is
then
adopted
as
the
true
one
it
preserves
the
older
stock
of
truths
with
a
minimum
of
modification
stretching
them
just
enough
to
make
them
admit
the
novelty
but
conceiving
that
in
ways
as
familiar
as
the
case
leaves
possible
an
outree
explanation
violating
all
our
preconceptions
would
never
pass
for
a
true
account
of
a
novelty
we
should
scratch
round
industriously
till
we
found
something
less
excentric
the
most
violent
revolutions
in
an
individual
beliefs
leave
most
of
his
old
order
standing
time
and
space
cause
and
effect
nature
and
history
and
one
own
biography
remain
untouched
new
truth
is
always
a
a
of
transitions
it
marries
old
opinion
to
new
fact
so
as
ever
to
show
a
minimum
of
jolt
a
maximum
of
continuity
we
hold
a
theory
true
just
in
proportion
to
its
success
in
solving
this
of
maxima
and
minima
but
success
in
solving
this
problem
is
eminently
a
matter
of
approximation
we
say
this
theory
solves
it
on
the
whole
more
satisfactorily
than
that
theory
but
that
means
more
satisfactorily
to
ourselves
and
individuals
will
emphasize
their
points
of
satisfaction
differently
to
a
certain
degree
therefore
everything
here
is
plastic
the
point
i
now
urge
you
to
observe
particularly
is
the
part
played
by
the
older
truths
failure
to
take
account
of
it
is
the
source
of
much
of
the
unjust
criticism
leveled
against
pragmatism
their
influence
is
absolutely
controlling
loyalty
to
them
is
the
first
principle
in
most
cases
it
is
the
only
principle
for
by
far
the
most
usual
way
of
handling
phenomena
so
novel
that
they
would
make
for
a
serious
rearrangement
of
our
preconceptions
is
to
ignore
them
altogether
or
to
abuse
those
who
bear
witness
for
them
you
doubtless
wish
examples
of
this
process
of
truth
growth
and
the
only
trouble
is
their
superabundance
the
simplest
case
of
new
truth
is
of
course
the
mere
numerical
addition
of
new
kinds
of
facts
or
of
new
single
facts
of
old
kinds
to
our
experience
an
addition
that
involves
no
alteration
in
the
old
beliefs
day
follows
day
and
its
contents
are
simply
added
the
new
contents
themselves
are
not
true
they
simply
come
and
are
truth
is
what
we
say
about
them
and
when
we
say
that
they
have
come
truth
is
satisfied
by
the
plain
additive
formula
but
often
the
day
contents
oblige
a
rearrangement
if
i
should
now
utter
piercing
shrieks
and
act
like
a
maniac
on
this
platform
it
would
make
many
of
you
revise
your
ideas
as
to
the
probable
worth
of
my
philosophy
came
the
other
day
as
part
of
the
day
content
and
seemed
for
a
moment
to
contradict
our
ideas
of
the
whole
order
of
nature
that
order
having
come
to
be
identified
with
what
is
called
the
conservation
of
energy
the
mere
sight
of
radium
paying
heat
away
indefinitely
out
of
its
own
pocket
seemed
to
violate
that
conservation
what
to
think
if
the
radiations
from
it
were
nothing
but
an
escape
of
unsuspected
energy
inside
of
the
atoms
the
principle
of
conservation
would
be
saved
the
discovery
of
as
the
radiation
outcome
opened
a
way
to
this
belief
so
ramsay
view
is
generally
held
to
be
true
because
altho
it
extends
our
old
ideas
of
energy
it
causes
a
minimum
of
alteration
in
their
nature
i
need
not
multiply
instances
a
new
opinion
counts
as
just
in
proportion
as
it
gratifies
the
individual
desire
to
assimilate
the
novel
in
his
experience
to
his
beliefs
in
stock
it
must
both
lean
on
old
truth
and
grasp
new
fact
and
its
success
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
in
doing
this
is
a
matter
for
the
individual
appreciation
when
old
truth
grows
then
by
new
truth
addition
it
is
for
subjective
reasons
we
are
in
the
process
and
obey
the
reasons
that
new
idea
is
truest
which
performs
most
felicitously
its
function
of
satisfying
our
double
urgency
it
makes
itself
true
gets
itself
classed
as
true
by
the
way
it
works
grafting
itself
then
upon
the
ancient
body
of
truth
which
thus
grows
much
as
a
tree
grows
by
the
activity
of
a
new
layer
of
cambium
now
dewey
and
schiller
proceed
to
generalize
this
observation
and
to
apply
it
to
the
most
ancient
parts
of
truth
they
also
once
were
plastic
they
also
were
called
true
for
human
reasons
they
also
mediated
between
still
earlier
truths
and
what
in
those
days
were
novel
observations
purely
objective
truth
truth
in
whose
establishment
the
function
of
giving
human
satisfaction
in
marrying
previous
parts
of
experience
with
newer
parts
played
no
role
whatever
is
nowhere
to
be
found
the
reasons
why
we
call
things
true
is
the
reason
why
they
are
true
for
be
true
means
only
to
perform
this
the
trail
of
the
human
serpent
is
thus
over
everything
truth
independent
truth
that
we
find
merely
truth
no
longer
malleable
to
human
need
truth
incorrigible
in
a
word
such
truth
exists
indeed
superabundantly
or
is
supposed
to
exist
by
rationalistically
minded
thinkers
but
then
it
means
only
the
dead
heart
of
the
living
tree
and
its
being
there
means
only
that
truth
also
has
its
paleontology
and
its
and
may
grow
stiff
with
years
of
veteran
service
and
petrified
in
men
regard
by
sheer
antiquity
but
how
plastic
even
the
oldest
truths
nevertheless
really
are
has
been
vividly
shown
in
our
day
by
the
transformation
of
logical
and
mathematical
ideas
a
transformation
which
seems
even
to
be
invading
physics
the
ancient
formulas
are
reinterpreted
as
special
expressions
of
much
wider
principles
principles
that
our
ancestors
never
got
a
glimpse
of
in
their
present
shape
and
formulation
schiller
still
gives
to
all
this
view
of
truth
the
name
of
but
for
this
doctrine
too
the
name
of
pragmatism
seems
fairly
to
be
in
the
ascendant
so
i
will
treat
it
under
the
name
of
pragmatism
in
these
lectures
such
then
would
be
the
scope
of
pragmatism
first
a
method
and
second
a
genetic
theory
of
what
is
meant
by
truth
and
these
two
things
must
be
our
future
topics
what
i
have
said
of
the
theory
of
truth
will
i
am
sure
have
appeared
obscure
and
unsatisfactory
to
most
of
you
by
reason
of
us
brevity
i
shall
make
amends
for
that
hereafter
in
a
lecture
on
sense
i
shall
try
to
show
what
i
mean
by
truths
grown
petrified
by
antiquity
in
another
lecture
i
shall
expatiate
on
the
idea
that
our
thoughts
become
true
in
proportion
as
they
successfully
exert
their
function
in
a
third
i
shall
show
how
hard
it
is
to
discriminate
subjective
from
objective
factors
in
truth
development
you
may
not
follow
me
wholly
in
these
lectures
and
if
you
do
you
may
not
wholly
agree
with
me
but
you
will
i
know
regard
me
at
least
as
serious
and
treat
my
effort
with
respectful
consideration
you
will
probably
be
surprised
to
learn
then
that
and
dewey
theories
have
suffered
a
hailstorm
of
contempt
and
ridicule
all
rationalism
has
risen
against
them
in
influential
quarters
schiller
in
particular
has
been
treated
like
an
impudent
schoolboy
who
deserves
a
spanking
i
should
not
mention
this
but
for
the
fact
that
it
throws
so
much
sidelight
upon
that
rationalistic
temper
to
which
i
have
opposed
the
temper
of
pragmatism
pragmatism
is
uncomfortable
away
from
facts
rationalism
is
comfortable
only
in
the
presence
of
abstractions
this
pragmatist
talk
about
truths
in
the
plural
about
their
utility
and
satisfactoriness
about
the
success
with
which
they
suggests
to
the
typical
intellectualist
mind
a
sort
of
coarse
lame
makeshift
article
of
truth
such
truths
are
not
real
truth
such
tests
are
merely
subjective
as
against
this
objective
truth
must
be
something
haughty
refined
remote
august
exalted
it
must
be
an
absolute
correspondence
of
our
thoughts
with
an
equally
absolute
reality
it
must
be
what
we
ought
to
think
unconditionally
the
conditioned
ways
in
which
we
do
think
are
so
much
irrelevance
and
matter
for
psychology
down
with
psychology
up
with
logic
in
all
this
question
see
the
exquisite
contrast
of
the
types
of
mind
the
pragmatist
clings
to
facts
and
concreteness
observes
truth
at
its
work
in
particular
cases
and
generalizes
truth
for
him
becomes
a
for
all
sorts
of
definite
in
experience
for
the
rationalist
it
remains
a
pure
abstraction
to
the
bare
name
of
which
we
must
defer
when
the
pragmatist
undertakes
to
show
in
detail
just
why
we
must
defer
the
rationalist
is
unable
to
recognize
the
concretes
from
which
his
own
abstraction
is
taken
he
accuses
us
of
denying
truth
whereas
we
have
only
sought
to
trace
exactly
why
people
follow
it
and
always
ought
to
follow
it
your
typical
fairly
shudders
at
concreteness
other
things
equal
he
positively
prefers
the
pale
and
spectral
if
the
two
universes
were
offered
he
would
always
choose
the
skinny
outline
rather
than
the
rich
thicket
of
reality
it
is
so
much
purer
clearer
nobler
i
hope
that
as
these
lectures
go
on
the
concreteness
and
closeness
to
facts
of
the
pragmatism
which
they
advocate
may
be
what
approves
itself
to
you
as
its
most
satisfactory
peculiarity
it
only
follows
here
the
example
of
the
interpreting
the
unobserved
by
the
observed
it
brings
old
and
new
harmoniously
together
it
converts
the
absolutely
empty
notion
of
a
static
relation
of
what
that
may
mean
we
must
ask
later
between
our
minds
and
reality
into
that
of
a
rich
and
active
commerce
that
anyone
may
follow
in
detail
and
understand
between
particular
thoughts
of
ours
and
the
great
universe
of
other
experiences
in
which
they
play
their
parts
and
have
their
uses
but
enough
of
this
at
present
the
justification
of
what
i
say
must
be
postponed
i
wish
now
to
add
a
word
in
further
explanation
of
the
claim
i
made
at
our
last
meeting
that
pragmatism
may
be
a
happy
harmonizer
of
empiricist
ways
of
thinking
with
the
more
religious
demands
of
human
beings
men
who
are
strongly
of
the
temperament
you
may
remember
me
to
have
said
are
liable
to
be
kept
at
a
distance
by
the
small
sympathy
with
facts
which
that
philosophy
from
the
fashion
of
idealism
offers
them
it
is
far
too
intellectualistic
old
fashioned
theism
was
bad
enough
with
its
notion
of
god
as
an
exalted
monarch
made
up
of
a
lot
of
unintelligible
or
preposterous
but
so
long
as
it
held
strongly
by
the
argument
from
design
it
kept
some
touch
with
concrete
realities
since
however
darwinism
has
once
for
all
displaced
design
from
the
minds
of
the
theism
has
lost
that
foothold
and
some
kind
of
an
immanent
or
pantheistic
deity
working
in
things
rather
than
above
them
is
if
any
the
kind
recommended
to
our
contemporary
imagination
aspirants
to
a
philosophic
religion
turn
as
a
rule
more
hopefully
nowadays
towards
idealistic
pantheism
than
towards
the
older
dualistic
theism
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
latter
still
counts
able
defenders
but
as
i
said
in
my
first
lecture
the
brand
of
pantheism
offered
is
hard
for
them
to
assimilate
if
they
are
lovers
of
facts
or
empirically
minded
it
is
the
absolutistic
brand
spurning
the
dust
and
reared
upon
pure
logic
it
keeps
no
connexion
whatever
with
concreteness
affirming
the
absolute
mind
which
is
its
substitute
for
god
to
be
the
rational
presupposition
of
all
particulars
of
fact
whatever
they
may
be
it
remains
supremely
indifferent
to
what
the
particular
facts
in
our
world
actually
are
be
they
what
they
may
the
absolute
will
father
them
like
the
sick
lion
in
esop
fable
all
footprints
lead
into
his
den
but
nulla
vestigia
retrorsum
you
can
not
redescend
into
the
world
of
particulars
by
the
absolute
aid
or
deduce
any
necessary
consequences
of
detail
important
for
your
life
from
your
idea
of
his
nature
he
gives
you
indeed
the
assurance
that
all
is
well
with
him
and
for
his
eternal
way
of
thinking
but
thereupon
he
leaves
you
to
be
finitely
saved
by
your
own
temporal
devices
far
be
it
from
me
to
deny
the
majesty
of
this
conception
or
its
capacity
to
yield
religious
comfort
to
a
most
respectable
class
of
minds
but
from
the
human
point
of
view
no
one
can
pretend
that
it
does
suffer
from
the
faults
of
remoteness
and
abstractness
it
is
eminently
a
product
of
what
i
have
ventured
to
call
the
rationalistic
temper
it
disdains
empiricism
needs
it
substitutes
a
pallid
outline
for
the
real
world
richness
it
is
dapper
it
is
noble
in
the
bad
sense
in
the
sense
in
which
to
be
noble
is
to
be
inapt
for
humble
service
in
this
real
world
of
sweat
and
dirt
it
seems
to
me
that
when
a
view
of
things
is
that
ought
to
count
as
a
presumption
against
its
truth
and
as
a
philosophic
disqualification
the
prince
of
darkness
may
be
a
gentleman
as
we
are
told
he
is
but
whatever
the
god
of
earth
and
heaven
is
he
can
surely
be
no
gentleman
his
menial
services
are
needed
in
the
dust
of
our
human
trials
even
more
than
his
dignity
is
needed
in
the
empyrean
now
pragmatism
devoted
tho
she
be
to
facts
has
no
such
materialistic
bias
as
ordinary
empiricism
labors
under
moreover
she
has
no
objection
whatever
to
the
realizing
of
abstractions
so
long
as
you
get
about
among
particulars
with
their
aid
and
they
actually
carry
you
somewhere
interested
in
no
conclusions
but
those
which
our
minds
and
our
experiences
work
out
together
she
has
no
a
priori
prejudices
against
theology
if
theological
ideas
prove
to
have
a
value
for
concrete
life
they
will
be
true
for
pragmatism
in
the
sense
of
being
good
for
so
much
for
how
much
more
they
are
true
will
depend
entirely
on
their
relations
to
the
other
truths
that
also
have
to
be
acknowledged
what
i
said
just
now
about
the
absolute
of
transcendental
idealism
is
a
case
in
point
first
i
called
it
majestic
and
said
it
yielded
religious
comfort
to
a
class
of
minds
and
then
i
accused
it
of
remoteness
and
sterility
but
so
far
as
it
affords
such
comfort
it
surely
is
not
sterile
it
has
that
amount
of
value
it
performs
a
concrete
function
as
a
good
pragmatist
i
myself
ought
to
call
the
absolute
true
so
far
forth
then
and
i
unhesitatingly
now
do
so
but
what
does
true
in
so
far
forth
mean
in
this
case
to
answer
we
need
only
apply
the
pragmatic
method
what
do
believers
in
the
absolute
mean
by
saying
that
their
belief
affords
them
comfort
they
mean
that
since
in
the
absolute
finite
evil
is
already
we
may
therefore
whenever
we
wish
treat
the
temporal
as
if
it
were
potentially
the
eternal
be
sure
that
we
can
trust
its
outcome
and
without
sin
dismiss
our
fear
and
drop
the
worry
of
our
finite
responsibility
in
short
they
mean
that
we
have
a
right
ever
and
anon
to
take
a
moral
holiday
to
let
the
world
wag
in
its
own
way
feeling
that
its
issues
are
in
better
hands
than
ours
and
are
none
of
our
business
the
universe
is
a
system
of
which
the
individual
members
may
relax
their
anxieties
occasionally
in
which
the
mood
is
also
right
for
men
and
moral
holidays
in
order
that
if
i
mistake
not
is
part
at
least
of
what
the
absolute
is
that
is
the
great
difference
in
our
particular
experiences
which
his
being
true
makes
for
us
that
is
part
of
his
when
he
is
pragmatically
interpreted
farther
than
that
the
ordinary
in
philosophy
who
thinks
favorably
of
absolute
idealism
does
not
venture
to
sharpen
his
conceptions
he
can
use
the
absolute
for
so
much
and
so
much
is
very
precious
he
is
pained
at
hearing
you
speak
incredulously
of
the
absolute
therefore
and
disregards
your
criticisms
because
they
deal
with
aspects
of
the
conception
that
he
fails
to
follow
if
the
absolute
means
this
and
means
no
more
than
this
who
can
possibly
deny
the
truth
of
it
to
deny
it
would
be
to
insist
that
men
should
never
relax
and
that
holidays
are
never
in
order
i
am
well
aware
how
odd
it
must
seem
to
some
of
you
to
hear
me
say
that
an
idea
is
so
long
as
to
believe
it
is
profitable
to
our
lives
that
it
is
good
for
as
much
as
it
profits
you
will
gladly
admit
if
what
we
do
by
its
aid
is
good
you
will
allow
the
idea
itself
to
be
good
in
so
far
forth
for
we
are
the
better
for
possessing
it
but
is
it
not
a
strange
misuse
of
the
word
you
will
say
to
call
ideas
also
for
this
reason
to
answer
this
difficulty
fully
is
impossible
at
this
stage
of
my
account
you
touch
here
upon
the
very
central
point
of
schiller
dewey
and
my
own
doctrine
of
truth
which
i
can
not
discuss
with
detail
until
my
sixth
lecture
let
me
now
say
only
this
that
truth
is
one
species
of
good
and
not
as
is
usually
supposed
a
category
distinct
from
good
and
with
it
the
true
is
the
name
of
whatever
proves
itself
to
be
good
in
the
way
of
belief
and
good
too
for
definite
assignable
reasons
surely
you
must
admit
this
that
if
there
were
no
good
for
life
in
true
ideas
or
if
the
knowledge
of
them
were
positively
disadvantageous
and
false
ideas
the
only
useful
ones
then
the
current
notion
that
truth
is
divine
and
precious
and
its
pursuit
a
duty
could
never
have
grown
up
or
become
a
dogma
in
a
world
like
that
our
duty
would
be
to
shun
truth
rather
but
in
this
world
just
as
certain
foods
are
not
only
agreeable
to
our
taste
but
good
for
our
teeth
our
stomach
and
our
tissues
so
certain
ideas
are
not
only
agreeable
to
think
about
or
agreeable
as
supporting
other
ideas
that
we
are
fond
of
but
they
are
also
helpful
in
life
practical
struggles
if
there
be
any
life
that
it
is
really
better
we
should
lead
and
if
there
be
any
idea
which
if
believed
in
would
help
us
to
lead
that
life
then
it
would
be
really
better
for
us
to
believe
in
that
idea
unless
indeed
belief
in
it
incidentally
clashed
with
other
greater
vital
benefits
would
be
better
for
us
to
believe
this
sounds
very
like
a
definition
of
truth
it
comes
very
near
to
saying
we
ought
to
believe
and
in
that
definition
none
of
you
would
find
any
oddity
ought
we
ever
not
to
believe
what
it
is
better
for
us
to
believe
and
can
we
then
keep
the
notion
of
what
is
better
for
us
and
what
is
true
for
us
permanently
apart
pragmatism
says
no
and
i
fully
agree
with
her
probably
you
also
agree
so
far
as
the
abstract
statement
goes
but
with
a
suspicion
that
if
we
practically
did
believe
everything
that
made
for
good
in
our
own
personal
lives
we
should
be
found
indulging
all
kinds
of
fancies
about
this
world
affairs
and
all
kinds
of
sentimental
superstitions
about
a
world
hereafter
your
suspicion
here
is
undoubtedly
well
founded
and
it
is
evident
that
something
happens
when
you
pass
from
the
abstract
to
the
concrete
that
complicates
the
situation
i
said
just
now
that
what
is
better
for
us
to
believe
is
true
unless
the
belief
incidentally
clashes
with
some
other
vital
benefit
now
in
real
life
what
vital
benefits
is
any
particular
belief
of
ours
most
liable
to
clash
with
what
indeed
except
the
vital
benefits
yielded
by
other
beliefs
when
these
prove
incompatible
with
the
first
ones
in
other
words
the
greatest
enemy
of
any
one
of
our
truths
may
be
the
rest
of
our
truths
truths
have
once
for
all
this
desperate
instinct
of
and
of
desire
to
extinguish
whatever
contradicts
them
my
belief
in
the
absolute
based
on
the
good
it
does
me
must
run
the
gauntlet
of
all
my
other
beliefs
grant
that
it
may
be
true
in
giving
me
a
moral
holiday
nevertheless
as
i
conceive
it
and
let
me
speak
now
confidentially
as
it
were
and
merely
in
my
own
private
person
it
clashes
with
other
truths
of
mine
whose
benefits
i
hate
to
give
up
on
its
account
it
happens
to
be
associated
with
a
kind
of
logic
of
which
i
am
the
enemy
i
find
that
it
entangles
me
in
metaphysical
paradoxes
that
are
inacceptable
but
as
i
have
enough
trouble
in
life
already
without
adding
the
trouble
of
carrying
these
intellectual
inconsistencies
i
personally
just
give
up
the
absolute
i
just
take
my
moral
holidays
or
else
as
a
professional
philosopher
i
try
to
justify
them
by
some
other
principle
if
i
could
restrict
my
notion
of
the
absolute
to
its
bare
value
it
would
clash
with
my
other
truths
but
we
can
not
easily
thus
restrict
our
hypotheses
they
carry
supernumerary
features
and
these
it
is
that
clash
so
my
disbelief
in
the
absolute
means
then
disbelief
in
those
other
supernumerary
features
for
i
fully
believe
in
the
legitimacy
of
taking
moral
holidays
you
see
by
this
what
i
meant
when
i
called
pragmatism
a
mediator
and
reconciler
and
said
borrowing
the
word
from
papini
that
he
unstiffens
our
theories
she
has
in
fact
no
prejudices
whatever
no
obstructive
dogmas
no
rigid
canons
of
what
shall
count
as
proof
she
is
completely
genial
she
will
entertain
any
hypothesis
she
will
consider
any
evidence
it
follows
that
in
the
religious
field
she
is
at
a
great
advantage
both
over
positivistic
empiricism
with
its
bias
and
over
religious
rationalism
with
its
exclusive
interest
in
the
remote
the
noble
the
simple
and
the
abstract
in
the
way
of
conception
in
short
she
widens
the
field
of
search
for
god
rationalism
sticks
to
logic
and
the
empyrean
empiricism
sticks
to
the
external
senses
pragmatism
is
willing
to
take
anything
to
follow
either
logic
or
the
senses
and
to
count
the
humblest
and
most
personal
experiences
she
will
count
mystical
experiences
if
they
have
practical
consequences
she
will
take
a
god
who
lives
in
the
very
dirt
of
private
that
should
seem
a
likely
place
to
find
him
her
only
test
of
probable
truth
is
what
works
best
in
the
way
of
leading
us
what
fits
every
part
of
life
best
and
combines
with
the
collectivity
of
experience
demands
nothing
being
omitted
if
theological
ideas
should
do
this
if
the
notion
of
god
in
particular
should
prove
to
do
it
how
could
pragmatism
possibly
deny
god
existence
she
could
see
no
meaning
in
treating
as
true
a
notion
that
was
pragmatically
so
successful
what
other
kind
of
truth
could
there
be
for
her
than
all
this
agreement
with
concrete
reality
in
my
last
lecture
i
shall
return
again
to
the
relations
of
pragmatism
with
religion
but
you
see
already
how
democratic
she
is
her
manners
are
as
various
and
flexible
her
resources
as
rich
and
endless
and
her
conclusions
as
friendly
as
those
of
mother
nature
lecture
iii
some
metaphysical
problems
pragmatically
considered
i
am
now
to
make
the
pragmatic
method
more
familiar
by
giving
you
some
illustrations
of
its
application
to
particular
problems
i
will
begin
with
what
is
driest
and
the
first
thing
i
shall
take
will
be
the
problem
of
substance
everyone
uses
the
old
distinction
between
substance
and
attribute
enshrined
as
it
is
in
the
very
structure
of
human
language
in
the
difference
between
grammatical
subject
and
predicate
here
is
a
bit
of
blackboard
crayon
its
modes
attributes
properties
accidents
or
affections
use
which
term
you
will
are
whiteness
friability
cylindrical
shape
insolubility
in
water
etc
but
the
bearer
of
these
attributes
is
so
much
chalk
which
thereupon
is
called
the
substance
in
which
they
inhere
so
the
attributes
of
this
desk
inhere
in
the
substance
those
of
my
coat
in
the
substance
and
so
forth
chalk
wood
and
wool
show
again
in
spite
of
their
differences
common
properties
and
in
so
far
forth
they
are
themselves
counted
as
modes
of
a
still
more
primal
substance
matter
the
attributes
of
which
are
space
occupancy
and
impenetrability
similarly
our
thoughts
and
feelings
are
affections
or
properties
of
our
several
souls
which
are
substances
but
again
not
wholly
in
their
own
right
for
they
are
modes
of
the
still
deeper
substance
now
it
was
very
early
seen
that
all
we
know
of
the
chalk
is
the
whiteness
friability
all
we
know
of
the
wood
is
the
combustibility
and
fibrous
structure
a
group
of
attributes
is
what
each
substance
here
is
they
form
its
sole
for
our
actual
experience
the
substance
is
in
every
case
revealed
through
them
if
we
were
cut
off
from
them
we
should
never
suspect
its
existence
and
if
god
should
keep
sending
them
to
us
in
an
unchanged
order
miraculously
annihilating
at
a
certain
moment
the
substance
that
supported
them
we
never
could
detect
the
moment
for
our
experiences
themselves
would
be
unaltered
nominalists
accordingly
adopt
the
opinion
that
substance
is
a
spurious
idea
due
to
our
inveterate
human
trick
of
turning
names
into
things
phenomena
come
in
groups
the
the
and
each
group
gets
its
name
the
name
we
then
treat
as
in
a
way
supporting
the
group
of
phenomena
the
low
thermometer
for
instance
is
supposed
to
come
from
something
called
the
climate
is
really
only
the
name
for
a
certain
group
of
days
but
it
is
treated
as
if
it
lay
behind
the
day
and
in
general
we
place
the
name
as
if
it
were
a
being
behind
the
facts
it
is
the
name
of
but
the
phenomenal
properties
of
things
nominalists
say
surely
do
not
really
inhere
in
names
and
if
not
in
names
then
they
do
not
inhere
in
anything
they
adhere
or
cohere
rather
with
each
other
and
the
notion
of
a
substance
inaccessible
to
us
which
we
think
accounts
for
such
cohesion
by
supporting
it
as
cement
might
support
pieces
of
mosaic
must
be
abandoned
the
fact
of
the
bare
cohesion
itself
is
all
that
the
notion
of
the
substance
signifies
behind
that
fact
is
nothing
scholasticism
has
taken
the
notion
of
substance
from
common
sense
and
made
it
very
technical
and
articulate
few
things
would
seem
to
have
fewer
pragmatic
consequences
for
us
than
substances
cut
off
as
we
are
from
every
contact
with
them
yet
in
one
case
scholasticism
has
proved
the
importance
of
the
by
treating
it
pragmatically
i
refer
to
certain
disputes
about
the
mystery
of
the
eucharist
substance
here
would
appear
to
have
momentous
pragmatic
value
since
the
accidents
of
the
wafer
do
change
in
the
lord
supper
and
yet
it
has
become
the
very
body
of
christ
it
must
be
that
the
change
is
in
the
substance
solely
the
must
have
been
withdrawn
and
the
divine
substance
substituted
miraculously
without
altering
the
immediate
sensible
properties
but
tho
these
do
alter
a
tremendous
difference
has
been
made
no
less
a
one
than
this
that
we
who
take
the
sacrament
now
feed
upon
the
very
substance
of
divinity
the
breaks
into
life
then
with
tremendous
effect
if
once
you
allow
that
substances
can
separate
from
their
accidents
and
exchange
these
latter
this
is
the
only
pragmatic
application
of
the
with
which
i
am
acquainted
and
it
is
obvious
that
it
will
only
be
treated
seriously
by
those
who
already
believe
in
the
presence
on
independent
grounds
material
substance
was
criticized
by
berkeley
with
such
telling
effect
that
his
name
has
reverberated
through
all
subsequent
philosophy
berkeley
treatment
of
the
notion
of
matter
is
so
well
known
as
to
need
hardly
more
than
a
mention
so
far
from
denying
the
external
world
which
we
know
berkeley
corroborated
it
it
was
the
scholastic
notion
of
a
material
substance
unapproachable
by
us
behind
the
external
world
deeper
and
more
real
than
it
and
needed
to
support
it
which
berkeley
maintained
to
be
the
most
effective
of
all
reducers
of
the
external
world
to
unreality
abolish
that
substance
he
said
believe
that
god
whom
you
can
understand
and
approach
sends
you
the
sensible
world
directly
and
you
confirm
the
latter
and
back
it
up
by
his
divine
authority
berkeley
criticism
of
was
consequently
absolutely
pragmatistic
matter
is
known
as
our
sensations
of
colour
figure
hardness
and
the
like
they
are
the
of
the
term
the
difference
matter
makes
to
us
by
truly
being
is
that
we
then
get
such
sensations
by
not
being
is
that
we
lack
them
these
sensations
then
are
its
sole
meaning
berkeley
does
deny
matter
then
he
simply
tells
us
what
it
consists
of
it
is
a
true
name
for
just
so
much
in
the
way
of
sensations
locke
and
later
hume
applied
a
similar
pragmatic
criticism
to
the
notion
of
spiritual
substance
i
will
only
mention
locke
treatment
of
our
identity
he
immediately
reduces
this
notion
to
its
pragmatic
value
in
terms
of
experience
it
means
he
says
so
much
consciousness
namely
the
fact
that
at
one
moment
of
life
we
remember
other
moments
and
feel
them
all
as
parts
of
one
and
the
same
personal
history
rationalism
had
explained
this
practical
continuity
in
our
life
by
the
unity
of
our
but
locke
says
suppose
that
god
should
take
away
the
consciousness
should
we
be
any
the
better
for
having
still
the
suppose
he
annexed
the
same
consciousness
to
different
souls
should
we
as
we
realize
ourselves
be
any
the
worse
for
that
fact
in
locke
day
the
soul
was
chiefly
a
thing
to
be
rewarded
or
punished
see
how
locke
discussing
it
from
this
point
of
view
keeps
the
question
pragmatic
suppose
he
says
one
to
think
himself
to
be
the
same
soul
that
once
was
nestor
or
thersites
can
he
think
their
actions
his
own
any
more
than
the
actions
of
any
other
man
that
ever
existed
but
let
him
once
find
himself
conscious
of
any
of
the
actions
of
nestor
he
then
finds
himself
the
same
person
with
nestor
in
this
personal
identity
is
founded
all
the
right
and
justice
of
reward
and
punishment
it
may
be
reasonable
to
think
no
one
shall
be
made
to
answer
for
what
he
knows
nothing
of
but
shall
receive
his
doom
his
consciousness
accusing
or
excusing
supposing
a
man
punished
now
for
what
he
had
done
in
another
life
whereof
he
could
be
made
to
have
no
consciousness
at
all
what
difference
is
there
between
that
punishment
and
being
created
miserable
our
personal
identity
then
consists
for
locke
solely
in
pragmatically
definable
particulars
whether
apart
from
these
verifiable
facts
it
also
inheres
in
a
spiritual
principle
is
a
merely
curious
speculation
locke
compromiser
that
he
was
passively
tolerated
the
belief
in
a
substantial
soul
behind
our
consciousness
but
his
successor
hume
and
most
empirical
psychologists
after
him
have
denied
the
soul
save
as
the
name
for
verifiable
cohesions
in
our
inner
life
they
redescend
into
the
stream
of
experience
with
it
and
cash
it
into
so
much
value
in
the
way
of
and
their
peculiar
connexions
with
each
other
as
i
said
of
berkeley
matter
the
soul
is
good
or
for
just
so
much
but
no
more
the
mention
of
material
substance
naturally
suggests
the
doctrine
of
but
philosophical
materialism
is
not
necessarily
knit
up
with
belief
in
as
a
metaphysical
principle
one
may
deny
matter
in
that
sense
as
strongly
as
berkeley
did
one
may
be
a
phenomenalist
like
huxley
and
yet
one
may
still
be
a
materialist
in
the
wider
sense
of
explaining
higher
phenomena
by
lower
ones
and
leaving
the
destinies
of
the
world
at
the
mercy
of
its
blinder
parts
and
forces
it
is
in
this
wider
sense
of
the
word
that
materialism
is
opposed
to
spiritualism
or
theism
the
laws
of
physical
nature
are
what
run
things
materialism
says
the
highest
productions
of
human
genius
might
be
ciphered
by
one
who
had
complete
acquaintance
with
the
facts
out
of
their
physiological
conditions
regardless
whether
nature
be
there
only
for
our
minds
as
idealists
contend
or
not
our
minds
in
any
case
would
have
to
record
the
kind
of
nature
it
is
and
write
it
down
as
operating
through
blind
laws
of
physics
this
is
the
complexion
of
present
day
materialism
which
may
better
be
called
naturalism
over
against
it
stands
or
what
in
a
wide
sense
may
be
termed
spiritualism
says
that
mind
not
only
witnesses
and
records
things
but
also
runs
and
operates
them
the
world
being
thus
guided
not
by
its
lower
but
by
its
higher
element
treated
as
it
often
is
this
question
becomes
little
more
than
a
conflict
between
aesthetic
preferences
matter
is
gross
coarse
crass
muddy
spirit
is
pure
elevated
noble
and
since
it
is
more
consonant
with
the
dignity
of
the
universe
to
give
the
primacy
in
it
to
what
appears
superior
spirit
must
be
affirmed
as
the
ruling
principle
to
treat
abstract
principles
as
finalities
before
which
our
intellects
may
come
to
rest
in
a
state
of
admiring
contemplation
is
the
great
rationalist
failing
spiritualism
as
often
held
may
be
simply
a
state
of
admiration
for
one
kind
and
of
dislike
for
another
kind
of
abstraction
i
remember
a
worthy
spiritualist
professor
who
always
referred
to
materialism
as
the
and
deemed
it
thereby
refuted
to
such
spiritualism
as
this
there
is
an
easy
answer
and
spencer
makes
it
effectively
in
some
pages
at
the
end
of
the
first
volume
of
his
psychology
he
shows
us
that
a
so
infinitely
subtile
and
performing
motions
as
inconceivably
quick
and
fine
as
those
which
modern
science
postulates
in
her
explanations
has
no
trace
of
grossness
left
he
shows
that
the
conception
of
spirit
as
we
mortals
hitherto
have
framed
it
is
itself
too
gross
to
cover
the
exquisite
tenuity
of
nature
facts
both
terms
he
says
are
but
symbols
pointing
to
that
one
unknowable
reality
in
which
their
oppositions
cease
to
an
abstract
objection
an
abstract
rejoinder
suffices
and
so
far
as
one
opposition
to
materialism
springs
from
one
disdain
of
matter
as
something
spencer
cuts
the
ground
from
under
one
matter
is
indeed
infinitely
and
incredibly
refined
to
anyone
who
has
ever
looked
on
the
face
of
a
dead
child
or
parent
the
mere
fact
that
matter
could
have
taken
for
a
time
that
precious
form
ought
to
make
matter
sacred
ever
after
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
principle
of
life
may
be
material
or
immaterial
matter
at
any
rate
lends
itself
to
all
life
purposes
that
beloved
incarnation
was
among
possibilities
but
now
instead
of
resting
in
principles
after
this
stagnant
intellectualist
fashion
let
us
apply
the
pragmatic
method
to
the
question
what
do
we
mean
by
matter
what
practical
difference
can
it
make
now
that
the
world
should
be
run
by
matter
or
by
spirit
i
think
we
find
that
the
problem
takes
with
this
a
rather
different
character
and
first
of
all
i
call
your
attention
to
a
curious
fact
it
makes
not
a
single
jot
of
difference
so
far
as
the
past
of
the
world
goes
whether
we
deem
it
to
have
been
the
work
of
matter
or
whether
we
think
a
divine
spirit
was
its
author
imagine
in
fact
the
entire
contents
of
the
world
to
be
once
for
all
irrevocably
given
imagine
it
to
end
this
very
moment
and
to
have
no
future
and
then
let
a
theist
and
a
materialist
apply
their
rival
explanations
to
its
history
the
theist
shows
how
a
god
made
it
the
materialist
shows
and
we
will
suppose
with
equal
success
how
it
resulted
from
blind
physical
forces
then
let
the
pragmatist
be
asked
to
choose
between
their
theories
how
can
he
apply
his
test
if
the
world
is
already
completed
concepts
for
him
are
things
to
come
back
into
experience
with
things
to
make
us
look
for
differences
but
by
hypothesis
there
is
to
be
no
more
experience
and
no
possible
differences
can
now
be
looked
for
both
theories
have
shown
all
their
consequences
and
by
the
hypothesis
we
are
adopting
these
are
identical
the
pragmatist
must
consequently
say
that
the
two
theories
in
spite
of
their
names
mean
exactly
the
same
thing
and
that
the
dispute
is
purely
verbal
i
am
opposing
of
course
that
the
theories
have
been
equally
successful
in
their
explanations
of
what
is
for
just
consider
the
case
sincerely
and
say
what
would
be
the
worth
of
a
god
if
he
were
there
with
his
work
accomplished
and
his
world
run
down
he
would
be
worth
no
more
than
just
that
world
was
worth
to
that
amount
of
result
with
its
mixed
merits
and
defects
his
creative
power
could
attain
but
go
no
farther
and
since
there
is
to
be
no
future
since
the
whole
value
and
meaning
of
the
world
has
been
already
paid
in
and
actualized
in
the
feelings
that
went
with
it
in
the
passing
and
now
go
with
it
in
the
ending
since
it
draws
no
supplemental
significance
such
as
our
real
world
draws
from
its
function
of
preparing
something
yet
to
come
why
then
by
it
we
take
god
measure
as
it
were
he
is
the
being
who
could
once
for
all
do
that
and
for
that
much
we
are
thankful
to
him
but
for
nothing
more
but
now
on
the
contrary
hypothesis
namely
that
the
bits
of
matter
following
their
laws
could
make
that
world
and
do
no
less
should
we
not
be
just
as
thankful
to
them
wherein
should
we
suffer
loss
then
if
we
dropped
god
as
an
hypothesis
and
made
the
matter
alone
responsible
where
would
any
special
deadness
or
crassness
come
in
and
how
experience
being
what
is
once
for
all
would
god
presence
in
it
make
it
any
more
living
or
richer
candidly
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
answer
to
this
question
the
actually
experienced
world
is
supposed
to
be
the
same
in
its
details
on
either
hypothesis
the
same
for
our
praise
or
blame
as
browning
says
it
stands
there
indefeasibly
a
gift
which
ca
be
taken
back
calling
matter
the
cause
of
it
retracts
no
single
one
of
the
items
that
have
made
it
up
nor
does
calling
god
the
cause
augment
them
they
are
the
god
or
the
atoms
respectively
of
just
that
and
no
other
world
the
god
if
there
has
been
doing
just
what
atoms
could
do
appearing
in
the
character
of
atoms
so
to
speak
and
earning
such
gratitude
as
is
due
to
atoms
and
no
more
if
his
presence
lends
no
different
turn
or
issue
to
the
performance
it
surely
can
lend
it
no
increase
of
dignity
nor
would
indignity
come
to
it
were
he
absent
and
did
the
atoms
remain
the
only
actors
on
the
stage
when
a
play
is
once
over
and
the
curtain
down
you
really
make
it
no
better
by
claiming
an
illustrious
genius
for
its
author
just
as
you
make
it
no
worse
by
calling
him
a
common
hack
thus
if
no
future
detail
of
experience
or
conduct
is
to
be
deduced
from
our
hypothesis
the
debate
between
materialism
and
theism
becomes
quite
idle
and
insignificant
matter
and
god
in
that
event
mean
exactly
the
same
thing
the
power
namely
neither
more
nor
less
that
could
make
just
this
completed
world
and
the
wise
man
is
he
who
in
such
a
case
would
turn
his
back
on
such
a
supererogatory
discussion
accordingly
most
men
instinctively
and
positivists
and
scientists
deliberately
do
turn
their
backs
on
philosophical
disputes
from
which
nothing
in
the
line
of
definite
future
consequences
can
be
seen
to
follow
the
verbal
and
empty
character
of
philosophy
is
surely
a
reproach
with
which
we
are
but
too
familiar
if
pragmatism
be
true
it
is
a
perfectly
sound
reproach
unless
the
theories
under
fire
can
be
shown
to
have
alternative
practical
outcomes
however
delicate
and
distant
these
may
be
the
common
man
and
the
scientist
say
they
discover
no
such
outcomes
and
if
the
metaphysician
can
discern
none
either
the
others
certainly
are
in
the
right
of
it
as
against
him
his
science
is
then
but
pompous
trifling
and
the
endowment
of
a
professorship
for
such
a
being
would
be
silly
accordingly
in
every
genuine
metaphysical
debate
some
practical
issue
however
conjectural
and
remote
is
involved
to
realize
this
revert
with
me
to
our
question
and
place
yourselves
this
time
in
the
world
we
live
in
in
the
world
that
has
a
future
that
is
yet
uncompleted
whilst
we
speak
in
this
unfinished
world
the
alternative
of
or
theism
is
intensely
practical
and
it
is
worth
while
for
us
to
spend
some
minutes
of
our
hour
in
seeing
that
it
is
so
how
indeed
does
the
program
differ
for
us
according
as
we
consider
that
the
facts
of
experience
up
to
date
are
purposeless
configurations
of
blind
atoms
moving
according
to
eternal
laws
or
that
on
the
other
hand
they
are
due
to
the
providence
of
god
as
far
as
the
past
facts
go
indeed
there
is
no
difference
those
facts
are
in
are
bagged
are
captured
and
the
good
that
in
them
is
gained
be
the
atoms
or
be
the
god
their
cause
there
are
accordingly
many
materialists
about
us
who
ignoring
altogether
the
future
and
practical
aspects
of
the
question
seek
to
eliminate
the
odium
attaching
to
the
word
materialism
and
even
to
eliminate
the
word
itself
by
showing
that
if
matter
could
give
birth
to
all
these
gains
why
then
matter
functionally
considered
is
just
as
divine
an
entity
as
god
in
fact
coalesces
with
god
is
what
you
mean
by
god
cease
these
persons
advise
us
to
use
either
of
these
terms
with
their
outgrown
opposition
use
a
term
free
of
the
clerical
connotations
on
the
one
hand
of
the
suggestion
of
coarseness
ignobility
on
the
other
talk
of
the
primal
mystery
of
the
unknowable
energy
of
the
one
and
only
power
instead
of
saying
either
god
or
matter
this
is
the
course
to
which
spencer
urges
us
and
if
philosophy
were
purely
retrospective
he
would
thereby
proclaim
himself
an
excellent
pragmatist
but
philosophy
is
prospective
also
and
after
finding
what
the
world
has
been
and
done
and
yielded
still
asks
the
further
question
does
the
world
promise
give
us
a
matter
that
promises
success
that
is
bound
by
its
laws
to
lead
our
world
ever
nearer
to
perfection
and
any
rational
man
will
worship
that
matter
as
readily
as
spencer
worships
his
own
unknowable
power
it
not
only
has
made
for
righteousness
up
to
date
but
it
will
make
for
righteousness
forever
and
that
is
all
we
need
doing
practically
all
that
a
god
can
do
it
is
equivalent
to
god
its
function
is
a
god
function
and
is
exerted
in
a
world
in
which
a
god
would
now
be
superfluous
from
such
a
world
a
god
could
never
lawfully
be
missed
emotion
would
here
be
the
right
name
for
religion
but
is
the
matter
by
which
spencer
process
of
cosmic
evolution
is
carried
on
any
such
principle
of
perfection
as
this
indeed
it
is
not
for
the
future
end
of
every
cosmically
evolved
thing
or
system
of
things
is
foretold
by
science
to
be
death
and
tragedy
and
spencer
in
confining
himself
to
the
aesthetic
and
ignoring
the
practical
side
of
the
controversy
has
really
contributed
nothing
serious
to
its
relief
but
apply
now
our
principle
of
practical
results
and
see
what
a
vital
significance
the
question
of
materialism
or
theism
immediately
acquires
theism
and
materialism
so
indifferent
when
taken
retrospectively
point
when
we
take
them
prospectively
to
wholly
different
outlooks
of
experience
for
according
to
the
theory
of
mechanical
evolution
the
laws
of
redistribution
of
matter
and
motion
tho
they
are
certainly
to
thank
for
all
the
good
hours
which
our
organisms
have
ever
yielded
us
and
for
all
the
ideals
which
our
minds
now
frame
are
yet
fatally
certain
to
undo
their
work
again
and
to
redissolve
everything
that
they
have
once
evolved
you
all
know
the
picture
of
the
last
state
of
the
universe
which
evolutionary
science
foresees
i
can
not
state
it
better
than
in
balfour
words
the
energies
of
our
system
will
decay
the
glory
of
the
sun
will
be
dimmed
and
the
earth
tideless
and
inert
will
no
longer
tolerate
the
race
which
has
for
a
moment
disturbed
its
solitude
man
will
go
down
into
the
pit
and
all
his
thoughts
will
perish
the
uneasy
consciousness
which
in
this
obscure
corner
has
for
a
brief
space
broken
the
contented
silence
of
the
universe
will
be
at
rest
matter
will
know
itself
no
longer
monuments
and
deeds
death
itself
and
love
stronger
than
death
will
be
as
though
they
had
never
been
nor
will
anything
that
is
be
better
or
be
worse
for
all
that
the
labour
genius
devotion
and
suffering
of
man
have
striven
through
countless
generations
to
effect
footnote
the
foundations
of
belief
p
that
is
the
sting
of
it
that
in
the
vast
driftings
of
the
cosmic
weather
tho
many
a
jeweled
shore
appears
and
many
an
enchanted
floats
away
long
lingering
ere
it
be
dissolved
even
as
our
world
now
lingers
for
our
when
these
transient
products
are
gone
nothing
absolutely
nothing
remains
of
represent
those
particular
qualities
those
elements
of
preciousness
which
they
may
have
enshrined
dead
and
gone
are
they
gone
utterly
from
the
very
sphere
and
room
of
being
without
an
echo
without
a
memory
without
an
influence
on
aught
that
may
come
after
to
make
it
care
for
similar
ideals
this
utter
final
wreck
and
tragedy
is
of
the
essence
of
scientific
materialism
as
at
present
understood
the
lower
and
not
the
higher
forces
are
the
eternal
forces
or
the
last
surviving
forces
within
the
only
cycle
of
evolution
which
we
can
definitely
see
spencer
believes
this
as
much
as
anyone
so
why
should
he
argue
with
us
as
if
we
were
making
silly
aesthetic
objections
to
the
of
and
motion
the
principles
of
his
philosophy
when
what
really
dismays
us
is
the
disconsolateness
of
its
ulterior
practical
results
no
the
true
objection
to
materialism
is
not
positive
but
negative
it
would
be
farcical
at
this
day
to
make
complaint
of
it
for
what
it
is
for
grossness
is
what
grossness
does
we
now
know
that
we
make
complaint
of
it
on
the
contrary
for
what
it
is
not
not
a
permanent
warrant
for
our
more
ideal
interests
not
a
fulfiller
of
our
remotest
hopes
the
notion
of
god
on
the
other
hand
however
inferior
it
may
be
in
clearness
to
those
mathematical
notions
so
current
in
mechanical
philosophy
has
at
least
this
practical
superiority
over
them
that
it
guarantees
an
ideal
order
that
shall
be
permanently
preserved
a
world
with
a
god
in
it
to
say
the
last
word
may
indeed
burn
up
or
freeze
but
we
then
think
of
him
as
still
mindful
of
the
old
ideals
and
sure
to
bring
them
elsewhere
to
fruition
so
that
where
he
is
tragedy
is
only
provisional
and
partial
and
shipwreck
and
dissolution
not
the
absolutely
final
things
this
need
of
an
eternal
moral
order
is
one
of
the
deepest
needs
of
our
breast
and
those
poets
like
dante
and
wordsworth
who
live
on
the
conviction
of
such
an
order
owe
to
that
fact
the
extraordinary
tonic
and
consoling
power
of
their
verse
here
then
in
these
different
emotional
and
practical
appeals
in
these
adjustments
of
our
concrete
attitudes
of
hope
and
expectation
and
all
the
delicate
consequences
which
their
differences
entail
lie
the
real
meanings
of
materialism
and
spiritualism
not
in
abstractions
about
matter
inner
essence
or
about
the
metaphysical
attributes
of
god
materialism
means
simply
the
denial
that
the
moral
order
is
eternal
and
the
cutting
off
of
ultimate
hopes
spiritualism
means
the
affirmation
of
an
eternal
moral
order
and
the
letting
loose
of
hope
surely
here
is
an
issue
genuine
enough
for
anyone
who
feels
it
and
as
long
as
men
are
men
it
will
yield
matter
for
a
serious
philosophic
debate
but
possibly
some
of
you
may
still
rally
to
their
defence
even
whilst
admitting
that
spiritualism
and
materialism
make
different
prophecies
of
the
world
future
you
may
yourselves
the
difference
as
something
so
infinitely
remote
as
to
mean
nothing
for
a
sane
mind
the
essence
of
a
sane
mind
you
may
say
is
to
take
shorter
views
and
to
feel
no
concern
about
such
chimaeras
as
the
latter
end
of
the
world
well
i
can
only
say
that
if
you
say
this
you
do
injustice
to
human
nature
religious
melancholy
is
not
disposed
of
by
a
simple
flourish
of
the
word
insanity
the
absolute
things
the
last
things
the
overlapping
things
are
the
truly
philosophic
concerns
all
superior
minds
feel
seriously
about
them
and
the
mind
with
the
shortest
views
is
simply
the
mind
of
the
more
shallow
man
the
issues
of
fact
at
stake
in
the
debate
are
of
course
vaguely
enough
conceived
by
us
at
present
but
spiritualistic
faith
in
all
its
forms
deals
with
a
world
of
promise
while
materialism
sun
sets
in
a
sea
of
disappointment
remember
what
i
said
of
the
absolute
it
grants
us
moral
holidays
any
religious
view
does
this
it
not
only
incites
our
more
strenuous
moments
but
it
also
takes
our
joyous
careless
trustful
moments
and
it
justifies
them
it
paints
the
grounds
of
justification
vaguely
enough
to
be
sure
the
exact
features
of
the
saving
future
facts
that
our
belief
in
god
insures
will
have
to
be
ciphered
out
by
the
interminable
methods
of
science
we
can
study
our
god
only
by
studying
his
creation
but
we
can
enjoy
our
god
if
we
have
one
in
advance
of
all
that
labor
i
myself
believe
that
the
evidence
for
god
lies
primarily
in
inner
personal
experiences
when
they
have
once
given
you
your
god
his
name
means
at
least
the
benefit
of
the
holiday
you
remember
what
i
said
yesterday
about
the
way
in
which
truths
clash
and
try
to
each
other
the
truth
of
has
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
all
our
other
truths
it
is
on
trial
by
them
and
they
on
trial
by
it
our
final
opinion
about
god
can
be
settled
only
after
all
the
truths
have
straightened
themselves
out
together
let
us
hope
that
they
shall
find
a
modus
vivendi
let
me
pass
to
a
very
cognate
philosophic
problem
the
question
of
design
in
nature
god
existence
has
from
time
immemorial
been
held
to
be
proved
by
certain
natural
facts
many
facts
appear
as
if
expressly
designed
in
view
of
one
another
thus
the
woodpecker
bill
tongue
feet
tail
fit
him
wondrously
for
a
world
of
trees
with
grubs
hid
in
their
bark
to
feed
upon
the
parts
of
our
eye
fit
the
laws
of
light
to
perfection
leading
its
rays
to
a
sharp
picture
on
our
retina
such
mutual
fitting
of
things
diverse
in
origin
argued
design
it
was
held
and
the
designer
was
always
treated
as
a
deity
the
first
step
in
these
arguments
was
to
prove
that
the
design
existed
nature
was
ransacked
for
results
obtained
through
separate
things
being
our
eyes
for
instance
originate
in
darkness
and
the
light
originates
in
the
sun
yet
see
how
they
fit
each
other
they
are
evidently
made
for
each
other
vision
is
the
end
designed
light
and
eyes
the
separate
means
devised
for
its
attainment
it
is
strange
considering
how
unanimously
our
ancestors
felt
the
force
of
this
argument
to
see
how
little
it
counts
for
since
the
triumph
of
the
darwinian
theory
darwin
opened
our
minds
to
the
power
of
to
bring
forth
results
if
only
they
have
time
to
add
themselves
together
he
showed
the
enormous
waste
of
nature
in
producing
results
that
get
destroyed
because
of
their
unfitness
he
also
emphasized
the
number
of
adaptations
which
if
designed
would
argue
an
evil
rather
than
a
good
designer
here
all
depends
upon
the
point
of
view
to
the
grub
under
the
bark
the
exquisite
fitness
of
the
woodpecker
organism
to
extract
him
would
certainly
argue
a
diabolical
designer
theologians
have
by
this
time
stretched
their
minds
so
as
to
embrace
the
darwinian
facts
and
yet
to
interpret
them
as
still
showing
divine
purpose
it
used
to
be
a
question
of
purpose
against
mechanism
of
one
or
the
other
it
was
as
if
one
should
say
my
shoes
are
evidently
designed
to
fit
my
feet
hence
it
is
impossible
that
they
should
have
been
produced
by
machinery
we
know
that
they
are
both
they
are
made
by
a
machinery
itself
designed
to
fit
the
feet
with
shoes
theology
need
only
stretch
similarly
the
designs
of
god
as
the
aim
of
a
is
not
merely
to
get
the
ball
to
a
certain
goal
if
that
were
so
they
would
simply
get
up
on
some
dark
night
and
place
it
there
but
to
get
it
there
by
a
fixed
machinery
of
conditions
the
game
rules
and
the
opposing
players
so
the
aim
of
god
is
not
merely
let
us
say
to
make
men
and
to
save
them
but
rather
to
get
this
done
through
the
sole
agency
of
nature
vast
machinery
without
nature
stupendous
laws
and
counterforces
man
creation
and
perfection
we
might
suppose
would
be
too
insipid
achievements
for
god
to
have
designed
them
this
saves
the
form
of
the
at
the
expense
of
its
old
easy
human
content
the
designer
is
no
longer
the
old
deity
his
designs
have
grown
so
vast
as
to
be
incomprehensible
to
us
humans
the
what
of
them
so
overwhelms
us
that
to
establish
the
mere
that
of
a
designer
for
them
becomes
of
very
little
consequence
in
comparison
we
can
with
difficulty
comprehend
the
character
of
a
cosmic
mind
whose
purposes
are
fully
revealed
by
the
strange
mixture
of
goods
and
evils
that
we
find
in
this
actual
world
particulars
or
rather
we
can
not
by
any
possibility
comprehend
it
the
mere
word
by
itself
has
we
see
no
consequences
and
explains
nothing
it
is
the
barrenest
of
principles
the
old
question
of
whether
there
is
design
is
idle
the
real
question
is
what
is
the
world
whether
or
not
it
have
a
designer
and
that
can
be
revealed
only
by
the
study
of
all
particulars
remember
that
no
matter
what
nature
may
have
produced
or
may
be
producing
the
means
must
necessarily
have
been
adequate
must
have
been
fitted
to
that
production
the
argument
from
fitness
to
design
would
consequently
always
apply
whatever
were
the
product
character
the
recent
eruption
for
example
required
all
previous
history
to
produce
that
exact
combination
of
ruined
houses
human
and
animal
corpses
sunken
ships
volcanic
ashes
in
just
that
one
hideous
configuration
of
positions
france
had
to
be
a
nation
and
colonize
martinique
our
country
had
to
exist
and
send
our
ships
there
if
god
aimed
at
just
that
result
the
means
by
which
the
centuries
bent
their
influences
towards
it
showed
exquisite
intelligence
and
so
of
any
state
of
things
whatever
either
in
nature
or
in
history
which
we
find
actually
realized
for
the
parts
of
things
must
always
make
some
definite
resultant
be
it
chaotic
or
harmonious
when
we
look
at
what
has
actually
come
the
conditions
must
always
appear
perfectly
designed
to
ensure
it
we
can
always
say
therefore
in
any
conceivable
world
of
any
conceivable
character
that
the
whole
cosmic
machinery
may
have
been
designed
to
produce
it
pragmatically
then
the
abstract
word
is
a
blank
cartridge
it
carries
no
consequences
it
does
no
execution
what
sort
of
design
and
what
sort
of
a
designer
are
the
only
serious
questions
and
the
study
of
facts
is
the
only
way
of
getting
even
approximate
answers
meanwhile
pending
the
slow
answer
from
facts
anyone
who
insists
that
there
is
a
designer
and
who
is
sure
he
is
a
divine
one
gets
a
certain
pragmatic
benefit
from
the
term
the
same
in
fact
which
we
saw
that
the
terms
god
spirit
or
the
absolute
yield
us
worthless
tho
it
be
as
a
mere
rationalistic
principle
set
above
or
behind
things
for
our
admiration
becomes
if
our
faith
concretes
it
into
something
theistic
a
term
of
promise
returning
with
it
into
experience
we
gain
a
more
confiding
outlook
on
the
future
if
not
a
blind
force
but
a
seeing
force
runs
things
we
may
reasonably
expect
better
issues
this
vague
confidence
in
the
future
is
the
sole
pragmatic
meaning
at
present
discernible
in
the
terms
design
and
designer
but
if
cosmic
confidence
is
right
not
wrong
better
not
worse
that
is
a
most
important
meaning
that
much
at
least
of
possible
the
terms
will
then
have
in
them
let
me
take
up
another
controversy
the
problem
most
persons
who
believe
in
what
is
called
their
do
so
after
the
rationalistic
fashion
it
is
a
principle
a
positive
faculty
or
virtue
added
to
man
by
which
his
dignity
is
enigmatically
augmented
he
ought
to
believe
it
for
this
reason
determinists
who
deny
it
who
say
that
individual
men
originate
nothing
but
merely
transmit
to
the
future
the
whole
push
of
the
past
cosmos
of
which
they
are
so
small
an
expression
diminish
man
he
is
less
admirable
stripped
of
this
creative
principle
i
imagine
that
more
than
half
of
you
share
our
instinctive
belief
in
and
that
admiration
of
it
as
a
principle
of
dignity
has
much
to
do
with
your
fidelity
but
has
also
been
discussed
pragmatically
and
strangely
enough
the
same
pragmatic
interpretation
has
been
put
upon
it
by
both
disputants
you
know
how
large
a
part
questions
of
accountability
have
played
in
ethical
controversy
to
hear
some
persons
one
would
suppose
that
all
that
ethics
aims
at
is
a
code
of
merits
and
demerits
thus
does
the
old
legal
and
theological
leaven
the
interest
in
crime
and
sin
and
punishment
abide
with
us
to
blame
whom
can
we
punish
whom
will
god
punish
these
preoccupations
hang
like
a
bad
dream
over
religious
history
so
both
and
determinism
have
been
inveighed
against
and
called
absurd
because
each
in
the
eyes
of
its
enemies
has
seemed
to
prevent
the
of
good
or
bad
deeds
to
their
authors
queer
antinomy
this
means
novelty
the
grafting
on
to
the
past
of
something
not
involved
therein
if
our
acts
were
predetermined
if
we
merely
transmitted
the
push
of
the
whole
past
the
say
how
could
we
be
praised
or
blamed
for
anything
we
should
be
only
not
and
where
then
would
be
our
precious
imputability
and
responsibility
but
where
would
it
be
if
we
had
rejoin
the
determinists
if
a
act
be
a
sheer
novelty
that
comes
not
from
me
the
previous
me
but
ex
nihilo
and
simply
tacks
itself
on
to
me
how
can
the
previous
i
be
responsible
how
can
i
have
any
permanent
character
that
will
stand
still
long
enough
for
praise
or
blame
to
be
awarded
the
chaplet
of
my
days
tumbles
into
a
cast
of
disconnected
beads
as
soon
as
the
thread
of
inner
necessity
is
drawn
out
by
the
preposterous
indeterminist
doctrine
fullerton
and
mctaggart
have
recently
laid
about
them
doughtily
with
this
argument
it
may
be
good
ad
hominem
but
otherwise
it
is
pitiful
for
i
ask
you
quite
apart
from
other
reasons
whether
any
man
woman
or
child
with
a
sense
for
realities
ought
not
to
be
ashamed
to
plead
such
principles
as
either
dignity
or
imputability
instinct
and
utility
between
them
can
safely
be
trusted
to
carry
on
the
social
business
of
punishment
and
praise
if
a
man
does
good
acts
we
shall
praise
him
if
he
does
bad
acts
we
shall
punish
him
anyhow
and
quite
apart
from
theories
as
to
whether
the
acts
result
from
what
was
previous
in
him
or
are
novelties
in
a
strict
sense
to
make
our
human
ethics
revolve
about
the
question
of
is
a
piteous
unreality
god
alone
can
know
our
merits
if
we
have
any
the
real
ground
for
supposing
is
indeed
pragmatic
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
contemptible
right
to
punish
which
had
made
such
a
noise
in
past
discussions
of
the
subject
pragmatically
means
novelties
in
the
world
the
right
to
expect
that
in
its
deepest
elements
as
well
as
in
its
surface
phenomena
the
future
may
not
identically
repeat
and
imitate
the
past
that
imitation
en
masse
is
there
who
can
deny
the
general
of
nature
is
presupposed
by
every
lesser
law
but
nature
may
be
only
approximately
uniform
and
persons
in
whom
knowledge
of
the
world
past
has
bred
pessimism
or
doubts
as
to
the
world
good
character
which
become
certainties
if
that
character
be
supposed
eternally
fixed
may
naturally
welcome
as
a
melioristic
doctrine
it
holds
up
improvement
as
at
least
possible
whereas
determinism
assures
us
that
our
whole
notion
of
possibility
is
born
of
human
ignorance
and
that
necessity
and
impossibility
between
them
rule
the
destinies
of
the
world
is
thus
a
general
cosmological
theory
of
promise
just
like
the
absolute
god
spirit
or
design
taken
abstractly
no
one
of
these
terms
has
any
inner
content
none
of
them
gives
us
any
picture
and
no
one
of
them
would
retain
the
least
pragmatic
value
in
a
world
whose
character
was
obviously
perfect
from
the
start
elation
at
mere
existence
pure
cosmic
emotion
and
delight
would
it
seems
to
me
quench
all
interest
in
those
speculations
if
the
world
were
nothing
but
a
lubberland
of
happiness
already
our
interest
in
religious
metaphysics
arises
in
the
fact
that
our
empirical
future
feels
to
us
unsafe
and
needs
some
higher
guarantee
if
the
past
and
present
were
purely
good
who
could
wish
that
the
future
might
possibly
not
resemble
them
who
could
desire
who
would
not
say
with
huxley
let
me
be
wound
up
every
day
like
a
watch
to
go
right
fatally
and
i
ask
no
better
freedom
in
a
world
already
perfect
could
only
mean
freedom
to
be
worse
and
who
could
be
so
insane
as
to
wish
that
to
be
necessarily
what
it
is
to
be
impossibly
aught
else
would
put
the
last
touch
of
perfection
upon
optimism
universe
surely
the
only
possibility
that
one
can
rationally
claim
is
the
possibility
that
things
may
be
better
that
possibility
i
need
hardly
say
is
one
that
as
the
actual
world
goes
we
have
ample
grounds
for
desiderating
thus
has
no
meaning
unless
it
be
a
doctrine
of
relief
as
such
it
takes
its
place
with
other
religious
doctrines
between
them
they
build
up
the
old
wastes
and
repair
the
former
desolations
our
spirit
shut
within
this
courtyard
of

always
saying
to
the
intellect
upon
the
tower
tell
us
of
the
night
if
it
aught
of
promise
bear
and
the
intellect
gives
it
then
these
terms
of
promise
other
than
this
practical
significance
the
words
god
design
have
none
yet
dark
tho
they
be
in
themselves
or
intellectualistically
taken
when
we
bear
them
into
life
thicket
with
us
the
darkness
there
grows
light
about
us
if
you
stop
in
dealing
with
such
words
with
their
definition
thinking
that
to
be
an
intellectual
finality
where
are
you
stupidly
staring
at
a
pretentious
sham
deus

a

et

omne

wherein
is
such
a
definition
really
instructive
it
means
less
than
nothing
in
its
pompous
robe
of
adjectives
pragmatism
alone
can
read
a
positive
meaning
into
it
and
for
that
she
turns
her
back
upon
the
intellectualist
point
of
view
altogether
in

the
world
that
the
heart
of
your
theology
and
for
that
you
need
no
rationalist
definitions
why
should
we
all
of
us
rationalists
as
well
as
pragmatists
confess
this
pragmatism
so
far
from
keeping
her
eyes
bent
on
the
immediate
practical
foreground
as
she
is
accused
of
doing
dwells
just
as
much
upon
the
world
remotest
perspectives
see
then
how
all
these
ultimate
questions
turn
as
it
were
up
their
hinges
and
from
looking
backwards
upon
principles
upon
an
erkenntnisstheoretische
ich
a
god
a
kausalitaetsprinzip
a
design
a
taken
in
themselves
as
something
august
and
exalted
above
facts
see
i
say
how
pragmatism
shifts
the
emphasis
and
looks
forward
into
facts
themselves
the
really
vital
question
for
us
all
is
what
is
this
world
going
to
be
what
is
life
eventually
to
make
of
itself
the
centre
of
gravity
of
philosophy
must
therefore
alter
its
place
the
earth
of
things
long
thrown
into
shadow
by
the
glories
of
the
upper
ether
must
resume
its
rights
to
shift
the
emphasis
in
this
way
means
that
philosophic
questions
will
fall
to
be
treated
by
minds
of
a
less
abstractionist
type
than
heretofore
minds
more
scientific
and
individualistic
in
their
tone
yet
not
irreligious
either
it
will
be
an
alteration
in
seat
of
authority
that
reminds
one
almost
of
the
protestant
reformation
and
as
to
papal
minds
protestantism
has
often
seemed
a
mere
mess
of
anarchy
and
confusion
such
no
doubt
will
pragmatism
often
seem
to
minds
in
philosophy
it
will
seem
so
much
sheer
trash
philosophically
but
life
wags
on
all
the
same
and
compasses
its
ends
in
protestant
countries
i
venture
to
think
that
philosophic
protestantism
will
compass
a
not
dissimilar
prosperity
lecture
iv
the
one
and
the
many
we
saw
in
the
last
lecture
that
the
pragmatic
method
in
its
dealings
with
certain
concepts
instead
of
ending
with
admiring
contemplation
plunges
forward
into
the
river
of
experience
with
them
and
prolongs
the
perspective
by
their
means
design
the
absolute
mind
spirit
instead
of
matter
have
for
their
sole
meaning
a
better
promise
as
to
this
world
outcome
be
they
false
or
be
they
true
the
meaning
of
them
is
this
meliorism
i
have
sometimes
thought
of
the
phenomenon
called
reflexion
in
optics
as
a
good
symbol
of
the
relation
between
abstract
ideas
and
concrete
realities
as
pragmatism
conceives
it
hold
a
tumbler
of
water
a
little
above
your
eyes
and
look
up
through
the
water
at
its
surface
or
better
still
look
similarly
through
the
flat
wall
of
an
aquarium
you
will
then
see
an
extraordinarily
brilliant
reflected
image
say
of
a
or
any
other
clear
object
situated
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
vessel
no
under
these
circumstances
gets
beyond
the
water
surface
every
ray
is
totally
reflected
back
into
the
depths
again
now
let
the
water
represent
the
world
of
sensible
facts
and
let
the
air
above
it
represent
the
world
of
abstract
ideas
both
worlds
are
real
of
course
and
interact
but
they
interact
only
at
their
boundary
and
the
locus
of
everything
that
lives
and
happens
to
us
so
far
as
full
experience
goes
is
the
water
we
are
like
fishes
swimming
in
the
sea
of
sense
bounded
above
by
the
superior
element
but
unable
to
breathe
it
pure
or
penetrate
it
we
get
our
oxygen
from
it
however
we
touch
it
incessantly
now
in
this
part
now
in
that
and
every
time
we
touch
it
we
are
reflected
back
into
the
water
with
our
course
and
the
abstract
ideas
of
which
the
air
consists
indispensable
for
life
but
irrespirable
by
themselves
as
it
were
and
only
active
in
their
function
all
similes
are
halting
but
this
one
rather
takes
my
fancy
it
shows
how
something
not
sufficient
for
life
in
itself
may
nevertheless
be
an
effective
determinant
of
life
elsewhere
in
this
present
hour
i
wish
to
illustrate
the
pragmatic
method
by
one
more
application
i
wish
to
turn
its
light
upon
the
ancient
problem
of
one
and
the
many
i
suspect
that
in
but
few
of
you
has
this
problem
occasioned
sleepless
nights
and
i
should
not
be
astonished
if
some
of
you
told
me
it
had
never
vexed
you
i
myself
have
come
by
long
brooding
over
it
to
consider
it
the
most
central
of
all
philosophic
problems
central
because
so
pregnant
i
mean
by
this
that
if
you
know
whether
a
man
is
a
decided
monist
or
a
decided
pluralist
you
perhaps
know
more
about
the
rest
of
his
opinions
than
if
you
give
him
any
other
name
ending
in
ist
to
believe
in
the
one
or
in
the
many
that
is
the
classification
with
the
maximum
number
of
consequences
so
bear
with
me
for
an
hour
while
i
try
to
inspire
you
with
my
own
interest
in
the
problem
philosophy
has
often
been
defined
as
the
quest
or
the
vision
of
the
world
unity
we
never
hear
this
definition
challenged
and
it
is
true
as
far
as
it
goes
for
philosophy
has
indeed
manifested
above
all
things
its
interest
in
unity
but
how
about
the
variety
in
things
is
that
such
an
irrelevant
matter
if
instead
of
using
the
term
philosophy
we
talk
in
general
of
our
intellect
and
its
needs
we
quickly
see
that
unity
is
only
one
of
these
acquaintance
with
the
details
of
fact
is
always
reckoned
along
with
their
reduction
to
system
as
an
indispensable
mark
of
mental
greatness
your
mind
of
encyclopedic
philological
type
your
man
essentially
of
learning
has
never
lacked
for
praise
along
with
your
philosopher
what
our
intellect
really
aims
at
is
neither
variety
nor
unity
taken
singly
but
totality

in
this
acquaintance
with

diversities
is
as
important
as
understanding
their
connexion
the
human
passion
of
curiosity
runs
on
all
fours
with
the
systematizing
passion
in
spite
of
this
obvious
fact
the
unity
of
things
has
always
been
considered
more
illustrious
as
it
were
than
their
variety
when
a
young
man
first
conceives
the
notion
that
the
whole
world
forms
one
great
fact
with
all
its
parts
moving
abreast
as
it
were
and
interlocked
he
feels
as
if
he
were
enjoying
a
great
insight
and
looks
superciliously
on
all
who
still
fall
short
of
this
sublime
conception
taken
thus
abstractly
as
it
first
comes
to
one
the
monistic
insight
is
so
vague
as
hardly
to
seem
worth
defending
intellectually
yet
probably
everyone
in
this
audience
in
some
way
cherishes
it
a
certain
abstract
monism
a
certain
emotional
response
to
the
character
of
oneness
as
if
it
were
a
feature
of
the
world
not
coordinate
with
its
manyness
but
vastly
more
excellent
and
eminent
is
so
prevalent
in
educated
circles
that
we
might
almost
call
it
a
part
of
philosophic
common
sense
of
course
the
world
is
one
we
say
how
else
could
it
be
a
world
at
all
empiricists
as
a
rule
are
as
stout
monists
of
this
abstract
kind
as
rationalists
are
the
difference
is
that
the
empiricists
are
less
dazzled
unity
blind
them
to
everything
else
does
quench
their
curiosity
for
special
facts
whereas
there
is
a
kind
of
rationalist
who
is
sure
to
interpret
abstract
unity
mystically
and
to
forget
everything
else
to
treat
it
as
a
principle
to
admire
and
worship
it
and
thereupon
to
come
to
a
full
stop
intellectually
world
is
one
the
formula
may
become
a
sort
of
and
have
it
is
true
been
reckoned
sacred
numbers
but
abstractly
taken
why
is
more
excellent
than
or
than
million
and
ten
in
this
first
vague
conviction
of
the
world
unity
there
is
so
little
to
take
hold
of
that
we
hardly
know
what
we
mean
by
it
the
only
way
to
get
forward
with
our
notion
is
to
treat
it
pragmatically
granting
the
oneness
to
exist
what
facts
will
be
different
in
consequence
what
will
the
unity
be
the
world
is
one
yes
but
how
one
what
is
the
practical
value
of
the
oneness
for
us
asking
such
questions
we
pass
from
the
vague
to
the
definite
from
the
abstract
to
the
concrete
many
distinct
ways
in
which
oneness
predicated
of
the
universe
might
make
a
difference
come
to
view
i
will
note
successively
the
more
obvious
of
these
ways
first
the
world
is
at
least
one
subject
of
discourse
if
its
manyness
were
so
irremediable
as
to
permit
no
union
whatever
of
it
parts
not
even
our
minds
could
the
whole
of
it
at
once
the
would
be
like
eyes
trying
to
look
in
opposite
directions
but
in
point
of
fact
we
mean
to
cover
the
whole
of
it
by
our
abstract
term
or
which
expressly
intends
that
no
part
shall
be
left
out
such
unity
of
discourse
carries
obviously
no
farther
monistic
specifications
a
once
so
named
has
as
much
unity
of
discourse
as
a
cosmos
it
is
an
odd
fact
that
many
monists
consider
a
great
victory
scored
for
their
side
when
pluralists
say
universe
is
many
universe
they
chuckle
his
speech
bewrayeth
him
he
stands
confessed
of
monism
out
of
his
own
mouth
well
let
things
be
one
in
that
sense
you
can
then
fling
such
a
word
as
universe
at
the
whole
collection
of
them
but
what
matters
it
it
still
remains
to
be
ascertained
whether
they
are
one
in
any
other
sense
that
is
more
valuable
are
they
for
example
continuous
can
you
pass
from
one
to
another
keeping
always
in
your
one
universe
without
any
danger
of
falling
out
in
other
words
do
the
parts
of
our
universe
hang
together
instead
of
being
like
detached
grains
of
sand
even
grains
of
sand
hang
together
through
the
space
in
which
they
are
embedded
and
if
you
can
in
any
way
move
through
such
space
you
can
pass
continuously
from
number
one
of
them
to
number
two
space
and
time
are
thus
vehicles
of
continuity
by
which
the
world
parts
hang
together
the
practical
difference
to
us
resultant
from
these
forms
of
union
is
immense
our
whole
motor
life
is
based
upon
them
there
are
innumerable
other
paths
of
practical
continuity
among
things
lines
of
influence
can
be
traced
by
which
they
together
following
any
such
line
you
pass
from
one
thing
to
another
till
you
may
have
covered
a
good
part
of
the
universe
extent
gravity
and
are
such
influences
so
far
as
the
physical
world
goes
electric
luminous
and
chemical
influences
follow
similar
lines
of
influence
but
opaque
and
inert
bodies
interrupt
the
continuity
here
so
that
you
have
to
step
round
them
or
change
your
mode
of
progress
if
you
wish
to
get
farther
on
that
day
practically
you
have
then
lost
your
universe
unity
so
far
as
it
was
constituted
by
those
first
lines
of
influence
there
are
innumerable
kinds
of
connexion
that
special
things
have
with
other
special
things
and
the
ensemble
of
any
one
of
these
connexions
forms
one
sort
of
system
by
which
things
are
conjoined
thus
men
are
conjoined
in
a
vast
network
of
acquaintanceship
brown
knows
jones
jones
knows
robinson
etc
and
by
choosing
your
farther
intermediaries
rightly
you
may
carry
a
message
from
jones
to
the
empress
of
china
or
the
chief
of
the
african
pigmies
or
to
anyone
else
in
the
inhabited
world
but
you
are
stopped
short
as
by
a
when
you
choose
one
man
wrong
in
this
experiment
what
may
be
called
are
grafted
on
the
a
loves
or
hates
b
b
loves
or
hates
c
etc
but
these
systems
are
smaller
than
the
great
that
they
presuppose
human
efforts
are
daily
unifying
the
world
more
and
more
in
definite
systematic
ways
we
found
colonial
postal
consular
commercial
systems
all
the
parts
of
which
obey
definite
influences
that
propagate
themselves
within
the
system
but
not
to
facts
outside
of
it
the
result
is
innumerable
little
of
the
world
parts
within
the
larger
little
worlds
not
only
of
discourse
but
of
operation
within
the
wider
universe
each
system
exemplifies
one
type
or
grade
of
union
its
parts
being
strung
on
that
peculiar
kind
of
relation
and
the
same
part
may
figure
in
many
different
systems
as
a
man
may
hold
several
offices
and
belong
to
various
clubs
from
this
point
of
view
therefore
the
pragmatic
value
of
the
world
unity
is
that
all
these
definite
networks
actually
and
practically
exist
some
are
more
enveloping
and
extensive
some
less
so
they
are
superposed
upon
each
other
and
between
them
all
they
let
no
individual
elementary
part
of
the
universe
escape
enormous
as
is
the
amount
of
disconnexion
among
things
for
these
systematic
influences
and
conjunctions
follow
rigidly
exclusive
paths
everything
that
exists
is
influenced
in
some
way
by
something
else
if
you
can
only
pick
the
way
out
rightly
loosely
speaking
and
in
general
it
may
be
said
that
all
things
cohere
and
adhere
to
each
other
somehow
and
that
the
universe
exists
practically
in
reticulated
or
concatenated
forms
which
make
of
it
a
continuous
or
affair
any
kind
of
influence
whatever
helps
to
make
the
world
one
so
far
as
you
can
follow
it
from
next
to
next
you
may
then
say
that
world
is
one
meaning
in
these
respects
namely
and
just
so
far
as
they
obtain
but
just
as
definitely
is
it
not
one
so
far
as
they
do
not
obtain
and
there
is
no
species
of
connexion
which
will
not
fail
if
instead
of
choosing
conductors
for
it
you
choose
you
are
then
arrested
at
your
very
first
step
and
have
to
write
the
world
down
as
a
pure
many
from
that
particular
point
of
view
if
our
intellect
had
been
as
much
interested
in
disjunctive
as
it
is
in
conjunctive
relations
philosophy
would
have
equally
successfully
celebrated
the
world
disunion
the
great
point
is
to
notice
that
the
oneness
and
the
manyness
are
absolutely
here
neither
is
primordial
or
more
essential
or
excellent
than
the
other
just
as
with
space
whose
separating
of
things
seems
exactly
on
a
par
with
its
uniting
of
them
but
sometimes
one
function
and
sometimes
the
other
is
what
come
home
to
us
most
so
in
our
general
dealings
with
the
world
of
influences
we
now
need
conductors
and
now
need
and
wisdom
lies
in
knowing
which
is
which
at
the
appropriate
moment
all
these
systems
of
influence
or
may
be
listed
under
the
general
problem
of
the
world
causal
unity
if
the
minor
causal
influences
among
things
should
converge
towards
one
common
causal
origin
of
them
in
the
past
one
great
first
cause
for
all
that
is
one
might
then
speak
of
the
absolute
causal
unity
of
the
world
god
fiat
on
creation
day
has
figured
in
traditional
philosophy
as
such
an
absolute
cause
and
origin
transcendental
idealism
translating
into
or
to
think
calls
the
divine
act
rather
than
but
the
union
of
the
many
here
is
absolute
just
the
same
the
many
would
not
be
save
for
the
one
against
this
notion
of
the
unity
of
origin
of
all
there
has
always
stood
the
pluralistic
notion
of
an
eternal
many
in
the
shape
of
atoms
or
even
of
spiritual
units
of
some
sort
the
alternative
has
doubtless
a
pragmatic
meaning
but
perhaps
as
far
as
these
lectures
go
we
had
better
leave
the
question
of
unity
of
origin
unsettled
the
most
important
sort
of
union
that
obtains
among
things
pragmatically
speaking
is
their
generic
unity
things
exist
in
kinds
there
are
many
specimens
in
each
kind
and
what
the
implies
for
one
specimen
it
implies
also
for
every
other
specimen
of
that
kind
we
can
easily
conceive
that
every
fact
in
the
world
might
be
singular
that
is
unlike
any
other
fact
and
sole
of
its
kind
in
such
a
world
of
singulars
our
logic
would
be
useless
for
logic
works
by
predicating
of
the
single
instance
what
is
true
of
all
its
kind
with
no
two
things
alike
in
the
world
we
should
be
unable
to
reason
from
our
past
experiences
to
our
future
ones
the
existence
of
so
much
generic
unity
in
things
is
thus
perhaps
the
most
momentous
pragmatic
specification
of
what
it
may
mean
to
say
world
is
one
absolute
generic
unity
would
obtain
if
there
were
one
summum
genus
under
which
all
things
without
exception
could
be
eventually
subsumed
would
be
candidates
for
this
position
whether
the
alternatives
expressed
by
such
words
have
any
pragmatic
significance
or
not
is
another
question
which
i
prefer
to
leave
unsettled
just
now
another
specification
of
what
the
phrase
world
is
one
may
mean
is
unity
of
purpose
an
enormous
number
of
things
in
the
world
subserve
a
common
purpose
all
the
systems
administrative
industrial
military
or
what
not
exist
each
for
its
controlling
purpose
every
living
being
pursues
its
own
peculiar
purposes
they
according
to
the
degree
of
their
development
in
collective
or
tribal
purposes
larger
ends
thus
enveloping
lesser
ones
until
an
absolutely
single
final
and
climacteric
purpose
subserved
by
all
things
without
exception
might
conceivably
be
reached
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
appearances
conflict
with
such
a
view
any
resultant
as
i
said
in
my
third
lecture
may
have
been
purposed
in
advance
but
none
of
the
results
we
actually
know
in
is
world
have
in
point
of
fact
been
purposed
in
advance
in
all
their
details
men
and
nations
start
with
a
vague
notion
of
being
rich
or
great
or
good
each
step
they
make
brings
unforeseen
chances
into
sight
and
shuts
out
older
vistas
and
the
specifications
of
the
general
purpose
have
to
be
daily
changed
what
is
reached
in
the
end
may
be
better
or
worse
than
what
was
proposed
but
it
is
always
more
complex
and
different
our
different
purposes
also
are
at
war
with
each
other
where
one
crush
the
other
out
they
compromise
and
the
result
is
again
different
from
what
anyone
distinctly
proposed
beforehand
vaguely
and
generally
much
of
what
was
purposed
may
be
gained
but
everything
makes
strongly
for
the
view
that
our
world
is
incompletely
unified
teleologically
and
is
still
trying
to
get
its
unification
better
organized
whoever
claims
absolute
teleological
unity
saying
that
there
is
one
purpose
that
every
detail
of
the
universe
subserves
dogmatizes
at
his
own
risk
theologians
who
dogmalize
thus
find
it
more
and
more
impossible
as
our
acquaintance
with
the
warring
interests
of
the
world
parts
grows
more
concrete
to
imagine
what
the
one
climacteric
purpose
may
possibly
be
like
we
see
indeed
that
certain
evils
minister
to
ulterior
goods
that
the
bitter
makes
the
cocktail
better
and
that
a
bit
of
danger
or
hardship
puts
us
agreeably
to
our
trumps
we
can
vaguely
generalize
this
into
the
doctrine
that
all
the
evil
in
the
universe
is
but
instrumental
to
its
greater
perfection
but
the
scale
of
the
evil
actually
in
sight
defies
all
human
tolerance
and
transcendental
idealism
in
the
pages
of
a
bradley
or
a
royce
brings
us
no
farther
than
the
book
of
job
did
god
ways
are
not
our
ways
so
let
us
put
our
hands
upon
our
mouth
a
god
who
can
relish
such
superfluities
of
horror
is
no
god
for
human
beings
to
appeal
to
his
animal
spirits
are
too
high
in
other
words
the
with
his
one
purpose
is
not
the
god
of
common
people
aesthetic
union
among
things
also
obtains
and
is
very
analogous
to
ideological
union
things
tell
a
story
their
parts
hang
together
so
as
to
work
out
a
climax
they
play
into
each
other
hands
expressively
retrospectively
we
can
see
that
altho
no
definite
purpose
presided
over
a
chain
of
events
yet
the
events
fell
into
a
dramatic
form
with
a
start
a
middle
and
a
finish
in
point
of
fact
all
stories
end
and
here
again
the
point
of
view
of
a
many
is
that
more
natural
one
to
take
the
world
is
full
of
partial
stories
that
run
parallel
to
one
another
beginning
and
ending
at
odd
times
they
mutually
interlace
and
interfere
at
points
but
we
can
not
unify
them
completely
in
our
minds
in
following
your
i
must
temporarily
turn
my
attention
from
my
own
even
a
biographer
of
twins
would
have
to
press
them
alternately
upon
his
reader
attention
it
follows
that
whoever
says
that
the
whole
world
tells
one
story
utters
another
of
those
monistic
dogmas
that
a
man
believes
at
his
risk
it
is
easy
to
see
the
world
history
pluralistically
as
a
rope
of
which
each
fibre
tells
a
separate
tale
but
to
conceive
of
each
of
the
rope
as
an
absolutely
single
fact
and
to
sum
the
whole
longitudinal
series
into
one
being
living
an
undivided
life
is
harder
we
have
indeed
the
analogy
of
embryology
to
help
us
the
microscopist
makes
a
hundred
flat
of
a
given
embryo
and
mentally
unites
them
into
one
solid
whole
but
the
great
world
ingredients
so
far
as
they
are
beings
seem
like
the
rope
fibres
to
be
discontinuous
and
to
cohere
only
in
the
longitudinal
direction
followed
in
that
direction
they
are
many
even
the
embryologist
when
he
follows
the
development
of
his
object
has
to
treat
the
history
of
each
single
organ
in
turn
absolute
aesthetic
union
is
thus
another
barely
abstract
ideal
the
world
appears
as
something
more
epic
than
dramatic
so
far
then
we
see
how
the
world
is
unified
by
its
many
systems
kinds
purposes
and
dramas
that
there
is
more
union
in
all
these
ways
than
openly
appears
is
certainly
true
that
there
may
be
one
sovereign
purpose
system
kind
and
story
is
a
legitimate
hypothesis
all
i
say
here
is
that
it
is
rash
to
affirm
this
dogmatically
without
better
evidence
than
we
possess
at
present
the
great
monistic
denkmittel
for
a
hundred
years
past
has
been
the
notion
of
the
one
knower
the
many
exist
only
as
objects
for
his
thought
exist
in
his
dream
as
it
were
and
as
he
knows
them
they
have
one
purpose
form
one
system
tell
one
tale
for
him
this
notion
of
an
noetic
unity
in
things
is
the
sublimest
achievement
of
intellectualist
philosophy
those
who
believe
in
the
absolute
as
the
is
termed
usually
say
that
they
do
so
for
coercive
reasons
which
clear
thinkers
can
not
evade
the
absolute
has
practical
consequences
some
of
which
i
drew
attention
in
my
second
lecture
many
kinds
of
difference
important
to
us
would
surely
follow
from
its
being
true
i
can
not
here
enter
into
all
the
logical
proofs
of
such
a
being
existence
farther
than
to
say
that
none
of
them
seem
to
me
sound
i
must
therefore
treat
the
notion
of
an
simply
as
an
hypothesis
exactly
on
a
par
logically
with
the
pluralist
notion
that
there
is
no
point
of
view
no
focus
of
information
extant
from
which
the
entire
content
of
the
universe
is
visible
at
once
consciousness
says
professor
royce
footnote
the
conception
of
god
new
york
p
forms
in
its
wholeness
one
luminously
transparent
conscious
moment
this
is
the
type
of
noetic
unity
on
which
rationalism
insists
empiricism
on
the
other
hand
is
satisfied
with
the
type
of
noetic
unity
that
is
humanly
familiar
everything
gets
known
by
some
knower
along
with
something
else
but
the
knowers
may
in
the
end
be
irreducibly
many
and
the
greatest
knower
of
them
all
may
yet
not
know
the
whole
of
everything
or
even
know
what
he
does
know
at
one
single
stroke
he
may
be
liable
to
forget
whichever
type
obtained
the
world
would
still
be
a
universe
noetically
its
parts
would
be
conjoined
by
knowledge
but
in
the
one
case
the
knowledge
would
be
absolutely
unified
in
the
other
it
would
be
strung
along
and
overlapped
the
notion
of
one
instantaneous
or
eternal
knower
either
adjective
here
means
the
same
thing
is
as
i
said
the
great
intellectualist
achievement
of
our
time
it
has
practically
driven
out
that
conception
of
which
earlier
philosophers
set
such
store
by
and
by
which
so
much
unifying
work
used
to
be
done
universal
substance
which
alone
has
being
in
and
from
itself
and
of
which
all
the
particulars
of
experience
are
but
forms
to
which
it
gives
support
substance
has
succumbed
to
the
pragmatic
criticisms
of
the
english
school
it
appears
now
only
as
another
name
for
the
fact
that
phenomena
as
they
come
are
actually
grouped
and
given
in
coherent
forms
the
very
forms
in
which
we
finite
knowers
experience
or
think
them
together
these
forms
of
conjunction
are
as
much
parts
of
the
tissue
of
experience
as
are
the
terms
which
they
connect
and
it
is
a
great
pragmatic
achievement
for
recent
idealism
to
have
made
the
world
hang
together
in
these
directly
representable
ways
instead
of
drawing
its
unity
from
the
of
its
parts
whatever
that
may
mean
in
an
unimaginable
principle
behind
the
scenes
world
is
one
therefore
just
so
far
as
we
experience
it
to
be
concatenated
one
by
as
many
definite
conjunctions
as
appear
but
then
also
not
one
by
just
as
many
definite
disjunctions
as
we
find
the
oneness
and
the
manyness
of
it
thus
obtain
in
respects
which
can
be
separately
named
it
is
neither
a
universe
pure
and
simple
nor
a
multiverse
pure
and
simple
and
its
various
manners
of
being
one
suggest
for
their
accurate
ascertainment
so
many
distinct
programs
of
scientific
work
thus
the
pragmatic
question
is
the
oneness
what
practical
difference
will
it
make
saves
us
from
all
feverish
excitement
over
it
as
a
principle
of
sublimity
and
carries
us
forward
into
the
stream
of
experience
with
a
cool
head
the
stream
may
indeed
reveal
far
more
connexion
and
union
than
we
now
suspect
but
we
are
not
entitled
on
pragmatic
principles
to
claim
absolute
oneness
in
any
respect
in
advance
it
is
so
difficult
to
see
definitely
what
absolute
oneness
can
mean
that
probably
the
majority
of
you
are
satisfied
with
the
sober
attitude
which
we
have
reached
nevertheless
there
are
possibly
some
radically
monistic
souls
among
you
who
are
not
content
to
leave
the
one
and
the
many
on
a
par
union
of
various
grades
union
of
diverse
types
union
that
stops
at
union
that
merely
goes
from
next
to
next
and
means
in
many
cases
outer
nextness
only
and
not
a
more
internal
bond
union
of
concatenation
in
short
all
that
sort
of
thing
seems
to
you
a
halfway
stage
of
thought
the
oneness
of
things
superior
to
their
manyness
you
think
must
also
be
more
deeply
true
must
be
the
more
real
aspect
of
the
world
the
pragmatic
view
you
are
sure
gives
us
a
universe
imperfectly
rational
the
real
universe
must
form
an
unconditional
unit
of
being
something
consolidated
with
its
parts
through
and
through
only
then
could
we
consider
our
estate
completely
rational
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
this
way
of
thinking
means
a
great
deal
to
many
minds
one
life
one
truth
one
love
one
principle
one
good
one
god
i
quote
from
a
christian
science
leaflet
which
the
day
mail
brings
into
my
hands
beyond
doubt
such
a
confession
of
faith
has
pragmatically
an
emotional
value
and
beyond
doubt
the
word
contributes
to
the
value
quite
as
much
as
the
other
words
but
if
we
try
to
realize
intellectually
what
we
can
possibly
mean
by
such
a
glut
of
oneness
we
are
thrown
right
back
upon
our
pragmatistic
determinations
again
it
means
either
the
mere
name
one
the
universe
of
discourse
or
it
means
the
sum
total
of
all
the
ascertainable
particular
conjunctions
and
concatenations
or
finally
it
means
some
one
vehicle
of
conjunction
treated
as
like
one
origin
one
purpose
or
one
knower
in
point
of
fact
it
always
means
one
knower
to
those
who
take
it
intellectually
the
one
knower
involves
they
think
the
other
forms
of
conjunction
his
world
must
have
all
its
parts
in
the
one
which
is
his
eternal
dream
the
character
of
the
absolute
knower
picture
is
however
so
impossible
for
us
to
represent
clearly
that
we
may
fairly
suppose
that
the
authority
which
absolute
monism
undoubtedly
possesses
and
probably
always
will
possess
over
some
persons
draws
its
strength
far
less
from
intellectual
than
from
mystical
grounds
to
interpret
absolute
monism
worthily
be
a
mystic
mystical
states
of
mind
in
every
degree
are
shown
by
history
usually
tho
not
always
to
make
for
the
monistic
view
this
is
no
proper
occasion
to
enter
upon
the
general
subject
of
mysticism
but
i
will
quote
one
mystical
pronouncement
to
show
just
what
i
mean
the
paragon
of
all
monistic
systems
is
the
vedanta
philosophy
of
hindostan
and
the
paragon
of
vedantist
missionaries
was
the
late
swami
vivekananda
who
visited
our
shores
some
years
ago
the
method
of
vedantism
is
the
mystical
method
you
do
not
reason
but
after
going
through
a
certain
discipline
you
see
and
having
seen
you
can
report
the
truth
vivekananda
thus
reports
the
truth
in
one
of
his
lectures
here
where
is
any
more
misery
for
him
who
sees
this
oneness
in
the
universe
this
oneness
of
life
oneness
of
everything
this
separation
between
man
and
man
man
and
woman
man
and
child
nation
from
nation
earth
from
moon
moon
from
sun
this
separation
between
atom
and
atom
is
the
cause
really
of
all
the
misery
and
the
vedanta
says
this
separation
does
not
exist
it
is
not
real
it
is
merely
apparent
on
the
surface
in
the
heart
of
things
there
is
unity
still
if
you
go
inside
you
find
that
unity
between
man
and
man
women
and
children
races
and
races
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
the
gods
and
men
all
are
one
and
animals
too
if
you
go
deep
enough
and
he
who
has
attained
to
that
has
no
more
delusion
where
is
any
more
delusion
for
him
what
can
delude
him
he
knows
the
reality
of
everything
the
secret
of
everything
where
is
there
any
more
misery
for
him
what
does
he
desire
he
has
traced
the
reality
of
everything
unto
the
lord
that
centre
that
unity
of
everything
and
that
is
eternal
bliss
eternal
knowledge
eternal
existence
neither
death
nor
disease
nor
sorrow
nor
misery
nor
discontent
is
there
in
the
centre
the
reality
there
is
no
one
to
be
mourned
for
no
one
to
be
sorry
for
he
has
penetrated
everything
the
pure
one
the
formless
the
bodiless
the
stainless
he
the
knower
he
the
great
poet
the
he
who
is
giving
to
everyone
what
he
deserves
observe
how
radical
the
character
of
the
monism
here
is
separation
is
not
simply
overcome
by
the
one
it
is
denied
to
exist
there
is
no
many
we
are
not
parts
of
the
one
it
has
no
parts
and
since
in
a
sense
we
undeniably
are
it
must
be
that
each
of
us
is
the
one
indivisibly
and
totally
an
absolute
one
and
i
that
one
surely
we
have
here
a
religion
which
emotionally
considered
has
a
high
pragmatic
value
it
imparts
a
perfect
sumptuosity
of
security
as
our
swami
says
in
another
place
when
man
has
seen
himself
as
one
with
the
infinite
being
of
the
universe
when
all
separateness
has
ceased
when
all
men
all
women
all
angels
all
gods
all
animals
all
plants
the
whole
universe
has
been
melted
into
that
oneness
then
all
fear
disappears
whom
to
fear
can
i
hurt
myself
can
i
kill
myself
can
i
injure
myself
do
you
fear
yourself
then
will
all
sorrow
disappear
what
can
cause
me
sorrow
i
am
the
one
existence
of
the
universe
then
all
jealousies
will
disappear
of
whom
to
be
jealous
of
myself
then
all
bad
feelings
disappear
against
whom
will
i
have
this
bad
feeling
against
myself
there
is
none
in
the
universe
but
me
kill
out
this
differentiation
kill
out
this
superstition
that
there
are
many
who
in
this
world
of
many
sees
that
one
he
who
in
this
mass
of
insentiency
sees
that
one
sentient
being
he
who
in
this
world
of
shadow
catches
that
reality
unto
him
belongs
eternal
peace
unto
none
else
unto
none
else
we
all
have
some
ear
for
this
monistic
music
it
elevates
and
reassures
we
all
have
at
least
the
germ
of
mysticism
in
us
and
when
our
idealists
recite
their
arguments
for
the
absolute
saying
that
the
slightest
union
admitted
anywhere
carries
logically
absolute
oneness
with
it
and
that
the
slightest
separation
admitted
anywhere
logically
carries
disunion
remediless
and
complete
i
can
not
help
suspecting
that
the
palpable
weak
places
in
the
intellectual
reasonings
they
use
are
protected
from
their
own
criticism
by
a
mystical
feeling
that
logic
or
no
logic
absolute
oneness
must
somehow
at
any
cost
be
true
oneness
overcomes
moral
separateness
at
any
rate
in
the
passion
of
love
we
have
the
mystic
germ
of
what
might
mean
a
total
union
of
all
sentient
life
this
mystical
germ
wakes
up
in
us
on
hearing
the
monistic
utterances
acknowledges
their
authority
and
assigns
to
intellectual
considerations
a
secondary
place
i
will
dwell
no
longer
on
these
religious
and
moral
aspects
of
the
question
in
this
lecture
when
i
come
to
my
final
lecture
there
will
be
something
more
to
say
leave
then
out
of
consideration
for
the
moment
the
authority
which
mystical
insights
may
be
conjectured
eventually
to
possess
treat
the
problem
of
the
one
and
the
many
in
a
purely
intellectual
way
and
we
see
clearly
enough
where
pragmatism
stands
with
her
criterion
of
the
practical
differences
that
theories
make
we
see
that
she
must
equally
abjure
absolute
monism
and
absolute
pluralism
the
world
is
one
just
so
far
as
its
parts
hang
together
by
any
definite
connexion
it
is
many
just
so
far
as
any
definite
connexion
fails
to
obtain
and
finally
it
is
growing
more
and
more
unified
by
those
systems
of
connexion
at
least
which
human
energy
keeps
framing
as
time
goes
on
it
is
possible
to
imagine
alternative
universes
to
the
one
we
know
in
which
the
most
various
grades
and
types
of
union
should
be
embodied
thus
the
lowest
grade
of
universe
would
be
a
world
of
mere
withness
of
which
the
parts
were
only
strung
together
by
the
conjunction
such
a
universe
is
even
now
the
collection
of
our
several
inner
lives
the
spaces
and
times
of
your
imagination
the
objects
and
events
of
your
are
not
only
more
or
less
incoherent
inter
se
but
are
wholly
out
of
definite
relation
with
the
similar
contents
of
anyone
mind
our
various
reveries
now
as
we
sit
here
compenetrate
each
other
idly
without
influencing
or
interfering
they
coexist
but
in
no
order
and
in
no
receptacle
being
the
nearest
approach
to
an
absolute
that
we
can
conceive
we
can
not
even
imagine
any
reason
why
they
should
be
known
all
together
and
we
can
imagine
even
less
if
they
were
known
together
how
they
could
be
known
as
one
systematic
whole
but
add
our
sensations
and
bodily
actions
and
the
union
mounts
to
a
much
higher
grade
our
audita
et
visa
and
our
acts
fall
into
those
receptacles
of
time
and
space
in
which
each
event
finds
its
date
and
place
they
form
and
are
of
too
and
can
be
classed
yet
we
can
imagine
a
world
of
things
and
of
kinds
in
which
the
causal
interactions
with
which
we
are
so
familiar
should
not
exist
everything
there
might
be
inert
towards
everything
else
and
refuse
to
propagate
its
influence
or
gross
mechanical
influences
might
pass
but
no
chemical
action
such
worlds
would
be
far
less
unified
than
ours
again
there
might
be
complete
interaction
but
no
minds
or
minds
but
altogether
private
ones
with
no
social
life
or
social
life
limited
to
acquaintance
but
no
love
or
love
but
no
customs
or
institutions
that
should
systematize
it
no
one
of
these
grades
of
universe
would
be
absolutely
irrational
or
disintegrated
inferior
tho
it
might
appear
when
looked
at
from
the
higher
grades
for
instance
if
our
minds
should
ever
become
connected
so
that
we
knew
immediately
or
could
under
certain
conditions
know
immediately
each
what
the
other
was
thinking
the
world
we
now
live
in
would
appear
to
the
thinkers
in
that
world
to
have
been
of
an
inferior
grade
with
the
whole
of
past
eternity
open
for
our
conjectures
to
range
in
it
may
be
lawful
to
wonder
whether
the
various
kinds
of
union
now
realized
in
the
universe
that
we
inhabit
may
not
possibly
have
been
successively
evolved
after
the
fashion
in
which
we
now
see
human
systems
evolving
in
consequence
of
human
needs
if
such
an
hypothesis
were
legitimate
total
oneness
would
appear
at
the
end
of
things
rather
than
at
their
origin
in
other
words
the
notion
of
the
would
have
to
be
replaced
by
that
of
the
the
two
notions
would
have
the
same
content
the
maximally
unified
content
of
fact
namely
but
their
would
be
positively
reversed

the
ultimate

essay

and

in
his
book
entitled
humanism
p
after
discussing
the
unity
of
the
universe
in
this
pragmatic
way
you
ought
to
see
why
i
said
in
my
second
lecture
borrowing
the
word
from
my
friend
papini
that
pragmatism
tends
to
unstiffen
all
our
theories
the
world
oneness
has
generally
been
affirmed
abstractly
only
and
as
if
anyone
who
questioned
it
must
be
an
idiot
the
temper
of
monists
has
been
so
vehement
as
almost
at
times
to
be
convulsive
and
this
way
of
holding
a
doctrine
does
not
easily
go
with
reasonable
discussion
and
the
drawing
of
distinctions
the
theory
of
the
absolute
in
particular
has
had
to
be
an
article
of
faith
affirmed
dogmatically
and
exclusively
the
one
and
all
first
in
the
order
of
being
and
of
knowing
logically
necessary
itself
and
uniting
all
lesser
things
in
the
bonds
of
mutual
necessity
how
could
it
allow
of
any
mitigation
of
its
inner
rigidity
the
slightest
suspicion
of
pluralism
the
minutest
wiggle
of
independence
of
any
one
of
its
parts
from
the
control
of
the
totality
would
ruin
it
absolute
unity
brooks
no
degrees
as
well
might
you
claim
absolute
purity
for
a
glass
of
water
because
it
contains
but
a
single
little
the
independence
however
infinitesimal
of
a
part
however
small
would
be
to
the
absolute
as
fatal
as
a
pluralism
on
the
other
hand
has
no
need
of
this
dogmatic
rigoristic
temper
provided
you
grant
some
separation
among
things
some
tremor
of
independence
some
free
play
of
parts
on
one
another
some
real
novelty
or
chance
however
minute
she
is
amply
satisfied
and
will
allow
you
any
amount
however
great
of
real
union
how
much
of
union
there
may
be
is
a
question
that
she
thinks
can
only
be
decided
empirically
the
amount
may
be
enormous
colossal
but
absolute
monism
is
shattered
if
along
with
all
the
union
there
has
to
be
granted
the
slightest
modicum
the
most
incipient
nascency
or
the
most
residual
trace
of
a
separation
that
is
not
pragmatism
pending
the
final
empirical
ascertainment
of
just
what
the
balance
of
union
and
disunion
among
things
may
be
must
obviously
range
herself
upon
the
pluralistic
side
some
day
she
admits
even
total
union
with
one
knower
one
origin
and
a
universe
consolidated
in
every
conceivable
way
may
turn
out
to
be
the
most
acceptable
of
all
hypotheses
meanwhile
the
opposite
hypothesis
of
a
world
imperfectly
unified
still
and
perhaps
always
to
remain
so
must
be
sincerely
entertained
this
latter
hypothesis
is
pluralism
doctrine
since
absolute
monism
forbids
its
being
even
considered
seriously
branding
it
as
irrational
from
the
start
it
is
clear
that
pragmatism
must
turn
its
back
on
absolute
monism
and
follow
pluralism
more
empirical
path
this
leaves
us
with
the
world
in
which
we
find
things
partly
joined
and
partly
disjoined
then
and
their
what
do
such
words
mean
pragmatically
handled
in
my
next
lecture
i
will
apply
the
pragmatic
method
to
the
stage
of
philosophizing
known
as
common
sense
lecture
v
pragmatism
and
common
sense
in
the
last
lecture
we
turned
ourselves
from
the
usual
way
of
talking
of
the
universe
oneness
as
a
principle
sublime
in
all
its
blankness
towards
a
study
of
the
special
kinds
of
union
which
the
universe
enfolds
we
found
many
of
these
to
coexist
with
kinds
of
separation
equally
real
how
far
am
i
verified
is
the
question
which
each
kind
of
union
and
each
kind
of
separation
asks
us
here
so
as
good
pragmatists
we
have
to
turn
our
face
towards
experience
towards
absolute
oneness
remains
but
only
as
an
hypothesis
and
that
hypothesis
is
reduced
nowadays
to
that
of
an
omniscient
knower
who
sees
all
things
without
exception
as
forming
one
single
systematic
fact
but
the
knower
in
question
may
still
be
conceived
either
as
an
absolute
or
as
an
ultimate
and
over
against
the
hypothesis
of
him
in
either
form
the
that
the
widest
field
of
knowledge
that
ever
was
or
will
be
still
contains
some
ignorance
may
be
legitimately
held
some
bits
of
information
always
may
escape
this
is
the
hypothesis
of
noetic
pluralism
which
monists
consider
so
absurd
since
we
are
bound
to
treat
it
as
respectfully
as
noetic
monism
until
the
facts
shall
have
tipped
the
beam
we
find
that
our
pragmatism
tho
originally
nothing
but
a
method
has
forced
us
to
be
friendly
to
the
pluralistic
view
it
may
be
that
some
parts
of
the
world
are
connected
so
loosely
with
some
other
parts
as
to
be
strung
along
by
nothing
but
the
copula
and
they
might
even
come
and
go
without
those
other
parts
suffering
any
internal
change
this
pluralistic
view
of
a
world
of
additive
constitution
is
one
that
pragmatism
is
unable
to
rule
out
from
serious
consideration
but
this
view
leads
one
to
the
farther
hypothesis
that
the
actual
world
instead
of
being
complete
as
the
monists
assure
us
may
be
eternally
incomplete
and
at
all
times
subject
to
addition
or
liable
to
loss
it
is
at
any
rate
incomplete
in
one
respect
and
flagrantly
so
the
very
fact
that
we
debate
this
question
shows
that
our
knowledge
is
incomplete
at
present
and
subject
to
addition
in
respect
of
the
knowledge
it
contains
the
world
does
genuinely
change
and
grow
some
general
remarks
on
the
way
in
which
our
knowledge
completes
itself
when
it
does
complete
itself
will
lead
us
very
conveniently
into
our
subject
for
this
lecture
which
is
sense
to
begin
with
our
knowledge
grows
in
spots
the
spots
may
be
large
or
small
but
the
knowledge
never
grows
all
over
some
old
knowledge
always
remains
what
it
was
your
knowledge
of
pragmatism
let
us
suppose
is
growing
now
later
its
growth
may
involve
considerable
modification
of
opinions
which
you
previously
held
to
be
true
but
such
modifications
are
apt
to
be
gradual
to
take
the
nearest
possible
example
consider
these
lectures
of
mine
what
you
first
gain
from
them
is
probably
a
small
amount
of
new
information
a
few
new
definitions
or
distinctions
or
points
of
view
but
while
these
special
ideas
are
being
added
the
rest
of
your
knowledge
stands
still
and
only
gradually
will
you
up
your
previous
opinions
with
the
novelties
i
am
trying
to
instil
and
modify
to
some
slight
degree
their
mass
you
listen
to
me
now
i
suppose
with
certain
prepossessions
as
to
my
competency
and
these
affect
your
reception
of
what
i
say
but
were
i
suddenly
to
break
off
lecturing
and
to
begin
to
sing
wo
go
home
till
morning
in
a
rich
baritone
voice
not
only
would
that
new
fact
be
added
to
your
stock
but
it
would
oblige
you
to
define
me
differently
and
that
might
alter
your
opinion
of
the
pragmatic
philosophy
and
in
general
bring
about
a
rearrangement
of
a
number
of
your
ideas
your
mind
in
such
processes
is
strained
and
sometimes
painfully
so
between
its
older
beliefs
and
the
novelties
which
experience
brings
along
our
minds
thus
grow
in
spots
and
like
the
spots
spread
but
we
let
them
spread
as
little
as
possible
we
keep
unaltered
as
much
of
our
old
knowledge
as
many
of
our
old
prejudices
and
beliefs
as
we
can
we
patch
and
tinker
more
than
we
renew
the
novelty
soaks
in
it
stains
the
ancient
mass
but
it
is
also
tinged
by
what
absorbs
it
our
past
apperceives
and
and
in
the
new
equilibrium
in
which
each
step
forward
in
the
process
of
learning
terminates
it
happens
relatively
seldom
that
the
new
fact
is
added
raw
more
usually
it
is
embedded
cooked
as
one
might
say
or
stewed
down
in
the
sauce
of
the
old
new
truths
thus
are
resultants
of
new
experiences
and
of
old
truths
combined
and
mutually
modifying
one
another
and
since
this
is
the
case
in
the
changes
of
opinion
of
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
it
has
not
been
so
at
all
times
it
follows
that
very
ancient
modes
of
thought
may
have
survived
through
all
the
later
changes
in
opinions
the
most
primitive
ways
of
thinking
may
not
yet
be
wholly
expunged
like
our
five
fingers
our
our
rudimentary
caudal
appendage
or
our
other
peculiarities
they
may
remain
as
indelible
tokens
of
events
in
our
our
ancestors
may
at
certain
moments
have
struck
into
ways
of
thinking
which
they
might
conceivably
not
have
found
but
once
they
did
so
and
after
the
fact
the
inheritance
continues
when
you
begin
a
piece
of
music
in
a
certain
key
you
must
keep
the
key
to
the
end
you
may
alter
your
house
ad
libitum
but
the
of
the
first
architect
persists
you
can
make
great
changes
but
you
can
not
change
a
gothic
church
into
a
doric
temple
you
may
rinse
and
rinse
the
bottle
but
you
ca
get
the
taste
of
the
medicine
or
whiskey
that
first
filled
it
wholly
out
my
thesis
now
is
this
that
our
fundamental
ways
of
thinking
about
things
are
discoveries
of
exceedingly
remote
ancestors
which
have
been
able
to
preserve
themselves
throughout
the
experience
of
all
subsequent
time
they
form
one
great
stage
of
equilibrium
in
the
human
development
the
stage
of
common
sense
other
stages
have
grafted
themselves
upon
this
stage
but
have
never
succeeded
in
displacing
it
let
us
consider
this
stage
first
as
if
it
might
be
final
in
practical
talk
a
man
common
sense
means
his
good
judgment
his
freedom
from
excentricity
his
gumption
to
use
the
vernacular
word
in
philosophy
it
means
something
entirely
different
it
means
his
use
of
certain
intellectual
forms
or
categories
of
thought
were
we
lobsters
or
bees
it
might
be
that
our
organization
would
have
led
to
our
using
quite
different
modes
from
these
of
apprehending
our
experiences
it
might
be
too
we
can
not
dogmatically
deny
this
that
such
categories
unimaginable
by
us
would
have
proved
on
the
whole
as
serviceable
for
handling
our
experiences
mentally
as
those
which
we
actually
use
if
this
sounds
paradoxical
to
anyone
let
him
think
of
analytical
geometry
the
identical
figures
which
euclid
defined
by
intrinsic
relations
were
defined
by
descartes
by
the
relations
of
their
points
to
adventitious
the
result
being
an
absolutely
different
and
vastly
more
potent
way
of
handling
curves
all
our
conceptions
are
what
the
germans
call
denkmittel
means
by
which
we
handle
facts
by
thinking
them
experience
merely
as
such
does
come
ticketed
and
labeled
we
have
first
to
discover
what
it
is
kant
speaks
of
it
as
being
in
its
first
intention
a
gewuehl
der
erscheinungen
a
rhapsodie
der
wahrnehmungen
a
mere
motley
which
we
have
to
unify
by
our
wits
what
we
usually
do
is
first
to
frame
some
system
of
concepts
mentally
classified
serialized
or
connected
in
some
intellectual
way
and
then
to
use
this
as
a
tally
by
which
we
tab
on
the
impressions
that
present
themselves
when
each
is
referred
to
some
possible
place
in
the
conceptual
system
it
is
thereby
this
notion
of
parallel
with
their
elements
standing
reciprocally
in
relations
is
proving
so
convenient
nowadays
in
mathematics
and
logic
as
to
supersede
more
and
more
the
older
classificatory
conceptions
there
are
many
conceptual
systems
of
this
sort
and
the
sense
manifold
is
also
such
a
system
find
a
relation
for
your
anywhere
among
the
concepts
and
in
so
far
forth
you
rationalize
the
impressions
but
obviously
you
can
rationalize
them
by
using
various
conceptual
systems
the
old
way
of
rationalizing
them
is
by
a
set
of
concepts
of
which
the
most
important
are
these
thing
the
same
or
different
kinds
minds
bodies
one
time
one
space
subjects
and
attributes
causal
influences
the
fancied
the
real
we
are
now
so
familiar
with
the
order
that
these
notions
have
woven
for
us
out
of
the
everlasting
weather
of
our
perceptions
that
we
find
it
hard
to
realize
how
little
of
a
fixed
routine
the
perceptions
follow
when
taken
by
themselves
the
word
weather
is
a
good
one
to
use
here
in
boston
for
example
the
weather
has
almost
no
routine
the
only
law
being
that
if
you
have
had
any
weather
for
two
days
you
will
probably
but
not
certainly
have
another
weather
on
the
third
as
it
thus
comes
to
boston
is
discontinuous
and
chaotic
in
point
of
temperature
of
wind
rain
or
sunshine
it
may
change
three
times
a
day
but
the
washington
intellectualizes
this
disorder
by
making
each
successive
bit
of
boston
weather
episodic
it
refers
it
to
its
place
and
moment
in
a
continental
cyclone
on
the
history
of
which
the
local
changes
everywhere
are
strung
as
beads
are
strung
upon
a
cord
now
it
seems
almost
certain
that
young
children
and
the
inferior
animals
take
all
their
experiences
very
much
as
uninstructed
bostonians
take
their
weather
they
know
no
more
of
time
or
space
as
or
of
permanent
subjects
and
changing
predicates
or
of
causes
or
kinds
or
thoughts
or
things
than
our
common
people
know
of
continental
cyclones
a
baby
rattle
drops
out
of
his
hand
but
the
baby
looks
not
for
it
it
has
out
for
him
as
a
goes
out
and
it
comes
back
when
you
replace
it
in
his
hand
as
the
flame
comes
back
when
relit
the
idea
of
its
being
a
whose
permanent
existence
by
itself
he
might
interpolate
between
its
successive
apparitions
has
evidently
not
occurred
to
him
it
is
the
same
with
dogs
out
of
sight
out
of
mind
with
them
it
is
pretty
evident
that
they
have
no
general
tendency
to
interpolate
let
me
quote
here
a
passage
from
my
colleague
santayana
book
if
a
dog
while
sniffing
about
contentedly
sees
afar
off
his
master
arriving
after
long
absence
the
poor
brute
asks
for
no
reason
why
his
master
went
why
he
has
come
again
why
he
should
be
loved
or
why
presently
while
lying
at
his
feet
you
forget
him
and
begin
to
grunt
and
dream
of
the
chase
all
that
is
an
utter
mystery
utterly
unconsidered
such
experience
has
variety
scenery
and
a
certain
vital
rhythm
its
story
might
be
told
in
dithyrambic
verse
it
moves
wholly
by
inspiration
every
event
is
providential
every
act
unpremeditated
absolute
freedom
and
absolute
helplessness
have
met
together
you
depend
wholly
on
divine
favour
yet
that
unfathomable
agency
is
not
distinguishable
from
your
own
life
but
the
figures
even
of
that
disordered
drama
have
their
exits
and
their
entrances
and
their
cues
can
be
gradually
discovered
by
a
being
capable
of
fixing
his
attention
and
retaining
the
order
of
events
in
proportion
as
such
understanding
advances
each
moment
of
experience
becomes
consequential
and
prophetic
of
the
rest
the
calm
places
in
life
are
filled
with
power
and
its
spasms
with
resource
no
emotion
can
overwhelm
the
mind
for
of
none
is
the
basis
or
issue
wholly
hidden
no
event
can
disconcert
it
altogether
because
it
sees
beyond
means
can
be
looked
for
to
escape
from
the
worst
predicament
and
whereas
each
moment
had
been
formerly
filled
with
nothing
but
its
own
adventure
and
surprised
emotion
each
now
makes
room
for
the
lesson
of
what
went
before
and
surmises
what
may
be
the
plot
of
the
whole
footnote
the
life
of
reason
reason
in
common
sense
p
even
science
and
philosophy
are
still
laboriously
trying
to
part
fancies
from
realities
in
our
experience
and
in
primitive
times
they
made
only
the
most
incipient
distinctions
in
this
line
men
believed
whatever
they
thought
with
any
liveliness
and
they
mixed
their
dreams
with
their
realities
inextricably
the
categories
of
and
are
indispensable
here
instead
of
being
realities
we
now
call
certain
experiences
only
there
is
not
a
category
among
those
enumerated
of
which
we
may
not
imagine
the
use
to
have
thus
originated
historically
and
only
gradually
spread
that
one
time
which
we
all
believe
in
and
in
which
each
event
has
its
definite
date
that
one
space
in
which
each
thing
has
its
position
these
abstract
notions
unify
the
world
incomparably
but
in
their
finished
shape
as
concepts
how
different
they
are
from
the
loose
unordered
experiences
of
natural
men
everything
that
happens
to
us
brings
its
own
duration
and
extension
and
both
are
vaguely
surrounded
by
a
marginal
that
runs
into
the
duration
and
extension
of
the
next
thing
that
comes
but
we
soon
lose
all
our
definite
bearings
and
not
only
do
our
children
make
no
distinction
between
yesterday
and
the
day
before
yesterday
the
whole
past
being
churned
up
together
but
we
adults
still
do
so
whenever
the
times
are
large
it
is
the
same
with
spaces
on
a
map
i
can
distinctly
see
the
relation
of
london
constantinople
and
pekin
to
the
place
where
i
am
in
reality
i
utterly
fail
to
feel
the
facts
which
the
map
symbolizes
the
directions
and
distances
are
vague
confused
and
mixed
cosmic
space
and
cosmic
time
so
far
from
being
the
intuitions
that
kant
said
they
were
are
constructions
as
patently
artificial
as
any
that
science
can
show
the
great
majority
of
the
human
race
never
use
these
notions
but
live
in
plural
times
and
spaces
interpenetrant
and
durcheinander
permanent
again
the
thing
and
its
various
and
the
different
of
thing
with
the
used
finally
as
a
of
which
the
thing
remains
the
what
a
straightening
of
the
tangle
of
our
experience
immediate
flux
and
sensible
variety
does
this
list
of
terms
suggest
and
it
is
only
the
smallest
part
of
his
experience
flux
that
anyone
actually
does
straighten
out
by
applying
to
it
these
conceptual
instruments
out
of
them
all
our
lowest
ancestors
probably
used
only
and
then
most
vaguely
and
inaccurately
the
notion
of
same
again
but
even
then
if
you
had
asked
them
whether
the
same
were
a
that
had
endured
throughout
the
unseen
interval
they
would
probably
have
been
at
a
loss
and
would
have
said
that
they
had
never
asked
that
question
or
considered
matters
in
that
light
kinds
and
sameness
of
kind
what
colossally
useful
denkmittel
for
finding
our
way
among
the
many
the
manyness
might
conceivably
have
been
absolute
experiences
might
have
all
been
singulars
no
one
of
them
occurring
twice
in
such
a
world
logic
would
have
had
no
application
for
kind
and
sameness
of
kind
are
logic
only
instruments
once
we
know
that
whatever
is
of
a
kind
is
also
of
that
kind
kind
we
can
travel
through
the
universe
as
if
with
boots
brutes
surely
never
use
these
abstractions
and
civilized
men
use
them
in
most
various
amounts
causal
influence
again
this
if
anything
seems
to
have
been
an
antediluvian
conception
for
we
find
primitive
men
thinking
that
almost
everything
is
significant
and
can
exert
influence
of
some
sort
the
search
for
the
more
definite
influences
seems
to
have
started
in
the
question
who
or
what
is
to
blame
for
any
illness
namely
or
disaster
or
untoward
thing
from
this
centre
the
search
for
causal
influences
has
spread
hume
and
together
have
tried
to
eliminate
the
whole
notion
of
influence
substituting
the
entirely
different
denkmittel
of
but
law
is
a
comparatively
recent
invention
and
influence
reigns
supreme
in
the
older
realm
of
common
sense
the
as
something
less
than
the
actual
and
more
than
the
wholly
unreal
is
another
of
these
magisterial
notions
of
common
sense
criticize
them
as
you
may
they
persist
and
we
fly
back
to
them
the
moment
critical
pressure
is
relaxed
in
the
substantial
or
metaphysical
sense
no
one
escapes
subjection
to
those
forms
of
thought
in
practice
the
denkmittel
are
uniformly
victorious
everyone
however
instructed
still
thinks
of
a
in
the
way
as
a
permanent
that
its
attributes
interchangeably
no
one
stably
or
sincerely
uses
the
more
critical
notion
of
a
group
of
united
by
a
law
with
these
categories
in
our
hand
we
make
our
plans
and
plot
together
and
connect
all
the
remoter
parts
of
experience
with
what
lies
before
our
eyes
our
later
and
more
critical
philosophies
are
mere
fads
and
fancies
compared
with
this
natural
of
thought
common
sense
appears
thus
as
a
perfectly
definite
stage
in
our
understanding
of
things
a
stage
that
satisfies
in
an
extraordinarily
successful
way
the
purposes
for
which
we
think
do
exist
even
when
we
do
not
see
them
their
also
exist
their
are
what
they
act
by
and
are
what
we
act
on
and
these
also
exist
these
lamps
shed
their
quality
of
light
on
every
object
in
this
room
we
intercept
it
on
its
way
whenever
we
hold
up
an
opaque
screen
it
is
the
very
sound
that
my
lips
emit
that
travels
into
your
ears
it
is
the
sensible
heat
of
the
fire
that
migrates
into
the
water
in
which
we
boil
an
egg
and
we
can
change
the
heat
into
coolness
by
dropping
in
a
lump
of
ice
at
this
stage
of
philosophy
all
men
without
exception
have
remained
it
suffices
for
all
the
necessary
practical
ends
of
life
and
among
our
own
race
even
it
is
only
the
highly
sophisticated
specimens
the
minds
debauched
by
learning
as
berkeley
calls
them
who
have
ever
even
suspected
common
sense
of
not
being
absolutely
true
but
when
we
look
back
and
speculate
as
to
how
the
categories
may
have
achieved
their
wonderful
supremacy
no
reason
appears
why
it
may
not
have
been
by
a
process
just
like
that
by
which
the
conceptions
due
to
democritus
berkeley
or
darwin
achieved
their
similar
triumphs
in
more
recent
times
in
other
words
they
may
have
been
successfully
discovered
by
prehistoric
geniuses
whose
names
the
night
of
antiquity
has
covered
up
they
may
have
been
verified
by
the
immediate
facts
of
experience
which
they
first
fitted
and
then
from
fact
to
fact
and
from
man
to
man
they
may
have
spread
until
all
language
rested
on
them
and
we
are
now
incapable
of
thinking
naturally
in
any
other
terms
such
a
view
would
only
follow
the
rule
that
has
proved
elsewhere
so
fertile
of
assuming
the
vast
and
remote
to
conform
to
the
laws
of
formation
that
we
can
observe
at
work
in
the
small
and
near
for
all
utilitarian
practical
purposes
these
conceptions
amply
suffice
but
that
they
began
at
special
points
of
discovery
and
only
gradually
spread
from
one
thing
to
another
seems
proved
by
the
exceedingly
dubious
limits
of
their
application
we
assume
for
certain
purposes
one
time
that
aequabiliter
fluit
but
we
livingly
believe
in
or
realize
any
such
time
is
a
less
vague
notion
but
what
are
they
is
a
constellation
properly
a
thing
or
an
army
or
is
an
ens
rationis
such
as
space
or
justice
a
thing
is
a
knife
whose
handle
and
blade
are
changed
the
is
the
whom
locke
so
seriously
discusses
of
the
human
is
a
or
a
the
moment
you
pass
beyond
the
practical
use
of
these
categories
a
use
usually
suggested
sufficiently
by
the
circumstances
of
the
special
case
to
a
merely
curious
or
speculative
way
of
thinking
you
find
it
impossible
to
say
within
just
what
limits
of
fact
any
one
of
them
shall
apply
the
peripatetic
philosophy
obeying
rationalist
propensities
has
tried
to
eternalize
the
categories
by
treating
them
very
technically
and
articulately
a
for
instance
is
a
being
or
ens
an
ens
is
a
subject
in
which
qualities
a
subject
is
a
substance
substances
are
of
kinds
and
kinds
are
definite
in
number
and
discrete
these
distinctions
are
fundamental
and
eternal
as
terms
of
discourse
they
are
indeed
magnificently
useful
but
what
they
mean
apart
from
their
use
in
steering
our
discourse
to
profitable
issues
does
not
appear
if
you
ask
a
scholastic
philosopher
what
a
substance
may
be
in
itself
apart
from
its
being
the
support
of
attributes
he
simply
says
that
your
intellect
knows
perfectly
what
the
word
means
but
what
the
intellect
knows
clearly
is
only
the
word
itself
and
its
steering
function
so
it
comes
about
that
intellects
sibi
permissi
intellects
only
curious
and
idle
have
forsaken
the
level
for
what
in
general
terms
may
be
called
the
level
of
thought
not
merely
such
intellects
either
your
humes
and
berkeleys
and
hegels
but
practical
observers
of
facts
your
galileos
daltons
faradays
have
found
it
impossible
to
treat
the
naifs
of
common
sense
as
ultimately
real
as
common
sense
interpolates
her
constant
between
our
intermittent
sensations
so
science
extrapolates
her
world
of
qualities
her
atoms
her
ether
her
magnetic
fields
and
the
like
beyond
the
world
the
are
now
invisible
impalpable
things
and
the
old
visible
things
are
supposed
to
result
from
the
mixture
of
these
invisibles
or
else
the
whole
naif
conception
of
thing
gets
superseded
and
a
thing
name
is
interpreted
as
denoting
only
the
law
or
regel
der
verbindung
by
which
certain
of
our
sensations
habitually
succeed
or
coexist
science
and
critical
philosophy
thus
burst
the
bounds
of
common
sense
with
science
naif
realism
ceases
qualities
become
unreal
primary
ones
alone
remain
with
critical
philosophy
havoc
is
made
of
everything
the
categories
one
and
all
cease
to
represent
anything
in
the
way
of
being
they
are
but
sublime
tricks
of
human
thought
our
ways
of
escaping
bewilderment
in
the
midst
of
irremediable
flow
but
the
scientific
tendency
in
critical
thought
tho
inspired
at
first
by
purely
intellectual
motives
has
opened
an
entirely
unexpected
range
of
practical
utilities
to
our
astonished
view
galileo
gave
us
accurate
clocks
and
accurate
the
chemists
flood
us
with
new
medicines
and
ampere
and
faraday
have
endowed
us
with
the
new
york
subway
and
with
marconi
telegrams
the
hypothetical
things
that
such
men
have
invented
defined
as
they
have
defined
them
are
showing
an
extraordinary
fertility
in
consequences
verifiable
by
sense
our
logic
can
deduce
from
them
a
consequence
due
under
certain
conditions
we
can
then
bring
about
the
conditions
and
presto
the
consequence
is
there
before
our
eyes
the
scope
of
the
practical
control
of
nature
newly
put
into
our
hand
by
scientific
ways
of
thinking
vastly
exceeds
the
scope
of
the
old
control
grounded
on
common
sense
its
rate
of
increase
accelerates
so
that
no
one
can
trace
the
limit
one
may
even
fear
that
the
being
of
man
may
be
crushed
by
his
own
powers
that
his
fixed
nature
as
an
organism
may
not
prove
adequate
to
stand
the
strain
of
the
ever
increasingly
tremendous
functions
almost
divine
creative
functions
which
his
intellect
will
more
and
more
enable
him
to
wield
he
may
drown
in
his
wealth
like
a
child
in
a
who
has
turned
on
the
water
and
who
can
not
turn
it
off
the
philosophic
stage
of
criticism
much
more
thorough
in
its
negations
than
the
scientific
stage
so
far
gives
us
no
new
range
of
practical
power
locke
hume
berkeley
kant
hegel
have
all
been
utterly
sterile
so
far
as
shedding
any
light
on
the
details
of
nature
goes
and
i
can
think
of
no
invention
or
discovery
that
can
be
directly
traced
to
anything
in
their
peculiar
thought
for
neither
with
nor
with
kant
nebular
hypothesis
had
their
respective
philosophic
tenets
anything
to
do
the
satisfactions
they
yield
to
their
disciples
are
intellectual
not
practical
and
even
then
we
have
to
confess
that
there
is
a
large
to
the
account
there
are
thus
at
least
three
levels
stages
or
types
of
thought
about
the
world
we
live
in
and
the
notions
of
one
stage
have
one
kind
of
merit
those
of
another
stage
another
kind
it
is
impossible
however
to
say
that
any
stage
as
yet
in
sight
is
absolutely
more
true
than
any
other
common
sense
is
the
more
consolidated
stage
because
it
got
its
innings
first
and
made
all
language
into
its
ally
whether
it
or
science
be
the
more
august
stage
may
be
left
to
private
judgment
but
neither
consolidation
nor
augustness
are
decisive
marks
of
truth
if
common
sense
were
true
why
should
science
have
had
to
brand
the
secondary
qualities
to
which
our
world
owes
all
its
living
interest
as
false

to
invent
an
invisible
world
of
points
and
curves
and
mathematical
equations

should
it

and
activities
into

to

always

with

make
them
definite
and

them
for
eternity
substantial
forms
in
other
words
our
secondary
qualities
hardly
outlasted
the
year
of
our
lord
people
were
already
tired
of
them
then
and
galileo
and
descartes
with
his
philosophy
gave
them
only
a
little
later
their
coup
de
grace
but
now
if
the
new
kinds
of
scientific
the
corpuscular
and
etheric
world
were
essentially
more
why
should
they
have
excited
so
much
criticism
within
the
body
of
science
itself
scientific
logicians
are
saying
on
every
hand
that
these
entities
and
their
determinations
however
definitely
conceived
should
not
be
held
for
literally
real
it
is
as
if
they
existed
but
in
reality
they
are
like
or
logarithms
only
artificial

taking
us

one
part
to
another
of

flux
we
can
cipher
fruitfully
with
them
they
serve
us
wonderfully
but
we
must
not
be
their
dupes
there
is
no
ringing
conclusion
possible
when
we
compare
these
types
of
thinking
with
a
view
to
telling
which
is
the
more
absolutely
true
their
naturalness
their
intellectual
economy
their
fruitfulness
for
practice
all
start
up
as
distinct
tests
of
their
veracity
and
as
a
result
we
get
confused
common
sense
is
better
for
one
sphere
of
life
science
for
another
philosophic
criticism
for
a
third
but
whether
either
be
truer
absolutely
heaven
only
knows
just
now
if
i
understand
the
matter
rightly
we
are
witnessing
a
curious
reversion
to
the
way
of
looking
at
physical
nature
in
the
philosophy
of
science
favored
by
such
men
as
mach
ostwald
and
duhem
according
to
these
teachers
no
hypothesis
is
truer
than
any
other
in
the
sense
of
being
a
more
literal
copy
of
reality
they
are
all
but
ways
of
talking
on
our
part
to
be
compared
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
use
the
only
literally
true
thing
is
reality
and
the
only
reality
we
know
is
for
these
logicians
sensible
reality
the
flux
of
our
sensations
and
emotions
as
they
pass
is
the
collective
name
according
to
ostwald
for
the
sensations
just
as
they
present
themselves
the
movement
heat
magnetic
pull
or
light
or
whatever
it
may
be
when
they
are
measured
in
certain
ways
so
measuring
them
we
are
enabled
to
describe
the
correlated
changes
which
they
show
us
in
formulas
matchless
for
their
simplicity
and
fruitfulness
for
human
use
they
are
sovereign
triumphs
of
economy
in
thought
no
one
can
fail
to
admire
the
philosophy
but
the
hypersensible
entities
the
corpuscles
and
vibrations
hold
their
own
with
most
physicists
and
chemists
in
spite
of
its
appeal
it
seems
too
economical
to
be
profusion
not
economy
may
after
all
be
reality
i
am
dealing
here
with
highly
technical
matters
hardly
suitable
for
popular
lecturing
and
in
which
my
own
competence
is
small
all
the
better
for
my
conclusion
however
which
at
this
point
is
this
the
whole
notion
of
truth
which
naturally
and
without
reflexion
we
assume
to
mean
the
simple
duplication
by
the
mind
of
a
and
given
reality
proves
hard
to
understand
clearly
there
is
no
simple
test
available
for
adjudicating
offhand
between
the
divers
types
of
thought
that
claim
to
possess
it
common
sense
common
science
or
corpuscular
philosophy
science
or
energetics
and
critical
or
idealistic
philosophy
all
seem
insufficiently
true
in
some
regard
and
leave
some
dissatisfaction
it
is
evident
that
the
conflict
of
these
so
widely
differing
systems
obliges
us
to
overhaul
the
very
idea
of
truth
for
at
present
we
have
no
definite
notion
of
what
the
word
may
mean
i
shall
face
that
task
in
my
next
lecture
and
will
add
but
a
few
words
in
finishing
the
present
one
there
are
only
two
points
that
i
wish
you
to
retain
from
the
present
lecture
the
first
one
relates
to
common
sense
we
have
seen
reason
to
suspect
it
to
suspect
that
in
spite
of
their
being
so
venerable
of
their
being
so
universally
used
and
built
into
the
very
structure
of
language
its
categories
may
after
all
be
only
a
collection
of
extraordinarily
successful
hypotheses
historically
discovered
or
invented
by
single
men
but
gradually
communicated
and
used
by
everybody
by
which
our
forefathers
have
from
time
immemorial
unified
and
straightened
the
discontinuity
of
their
immediate
experiences
and
put
themselves
into
an
equilibrium
with
the
surface
of
nature
so
satisfactory
for
ordinary
practical
purposes
that
it
certainly
would
have
lasted
forever
but
for
the
excessive
intellectual
vivacity
of
democritus
archimedes
galileo
berkeley
and
other
excentric
geniuses
whom
the
example
of
such
men
inflamed
retain
i
pray
you
this
suspicion
about
common
sense
the
other
point
is
this
ought
not
the
existence
of
the
various
types
of
thinking
which
we
have
reviewed
each
so
splendid
for
certain
purposes
yet
all
conflicting
still
and
neither
one
of
them
able
to
support
a
claim
of
absolute
veracity
to
awaken
a
presumption
favorable
to
the
pragmatistic
view
that
all
our
theories
are
instrumental
are
mental
modes
of
adaptation
to
reality
rather
than
revelations
or
gnostic
answers
to
some
divinely
instituted
i
expressed
this
view
as
clearly
as
i
could
in
the
second
of
these
lectures
certainly
the
restlessness
of
the
actual
theoretic
situation
the
value
for
some
purposes
of
each
and
the
inability
of
either
to
expel
the
others
decisively
suggest
this
pragmatistic
view
which
i
hope
that
the
next
lectures
may
soon
make
entirely
convincing
may
there
not
after
all
be
a
possible
ambiguity
in
truth
lecture
vi
pragmatism
conception
of
truth
when
clerk
maxwell
was
a
child
it
is
written
that
he
had
a
mania
for
having
everything
explained
to
him
and
that
when
people
put
him
off
with
vague
verbal
accounts
of
any
phenomenon
he
would
interrupt
them
impatiently
by
saying
yes
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
the
particular
go
of
it
had
his
question
been
about
truth
only
a
pragmatist
could
have
told
him
the
particular
go
of
it
i
believe
that
our
contemporary
pragmatists
especially
schiller
and
dewey
have
given
the
only
tenable
account
of
this
subject
it
is
a
very
ticklish
subject
sending
subtle
rootlets
into
all
kinds
of
crannies
and
hard
to
treat
in
the
sketchy
way
that
alone
befits
a
public
lecture
but
the
view
of
truth
has
been
so
ferociously
attacked
by
rationalistic
philosophers
and
so
abominably
misunderstood
that
here
if
anywhere
is
the
point
where
a
clear
and
simple
statement
should
be
made
i
fully
expect
to
see
the
pragmatist
view
of
truth
run
through
the
classic
stages
of
a
theory
career
first
you
know
a
new
theory
is
attacked
as
absurd
then
it
is
admitted
to
be
true
but
obvious
and
insignificant
finally
it
is
seen
to
be
so
important
that
its
adversaries
claim
that
they
themselves
discovered
it
our
doctrine
of
truth
is
at
present
in
the
first
of
these
three
stages
with
symptoms
of
the
second
stage
having
begun
in
certain
quarters
i
wish
that
this
lecture
might
help
it
beyond
the
first
stage
in
the
eyes
of
many
of
you
truth
as
any
dictionary
will
tell
you
is
a
property
of
certain
of
our
ideas
it
means
their
as
falsity
means
their
disagreement
with
pragmatists
and
intellectualists
both
accept
this
definition
as
a
matter
of
course
they
begin
to
quarrel
only
after
the
question
is
raised
as
to
what
may
precisely
be
meant
by
the
term
and
what
by
the
term
when
reality
is
taken
as
something
for
our
ideas
to
agree
with
in
answering
these
questions
the
pragmatists
are
more
analytic
and
painstaking
the
intellectualists
more
offhand
and
irreflective
the
popular
notion
is
that
a
true
idea
must
copy
its
reality
like
other
popular
views
this
one
follows
the
analogy
of
the
most
usual
experience
our
true
ideas
of
sensible
things
do
indeed
copy
them
shut
your
eyes
and
think
of
yonder
clock
on
the
wall
and
you
get
just
such
a
true
picture
or
copy
of
its
dial
but
your
idea
of
its
unless
you
are
a
is
much
less
of
a
copy
yet
it
passes
muster
for
it
in
no
way
clashes
with
the
reality
even
tho
it
should
shrink
to
the
mere
word
that
word
still
serves
you
truly
and
when
you
speak
of
the
function
of
the
clock
or
of
its
it
is
hard
to
see
exactly
what
your
ideas
can
copy
you
perceive
that
there
is
a
problem
here
where
our
ideas
can
not
copy
definitely
their
object
what
does
agreement
with
that
object
mean
some
idealists
seem
to
say
that
they
are
true
whenever
they
are
what
god
means
that
we
ought
to
think
about
that
object
others
hold
the
all
through
and
speak
as
if
our
ideas
possessed
truth
just
in
proportion
as
they
approach
to
being
copies
of
the
absolute
eternal
way
of
thinking
these
views
you
see
invite
pragmatistic
discussion
but
the
great
assumption
of
the
intellectualists
is
that
truth
means
essentially
an
inert
static
relation
when
you
got
your
true
idea
of
anything
there
an
end
of
the
matter
you
in
possession
you
know
you
have
fulfilled
your
thinking
destiny
you
are
where
you
ought
to
be
mentally
you
have
obeyed
your
categorical
imperative
and
nothing
more
need
follow
on
that
climax
of
your
rational
destiny
epistemologically
you
are
in
stable
equilibrium
pragmatism
on
the
other
hand
asks
its
usual
question
grant
an
idea
or
belief
to
be
true
it
says
what
concrete
difference
will
its
being
true
make
in
anyone
actual
life
how
will
the
truth
be
realized
what
experiences
will
be
different
from
those
which
would
obtain
if
the
belief
were
false
what
in
short
is
the
truth
in
experiential
terms
the
moment
pragmatism
asks
this
question
it
sees
the
answer
true
ideas
are
those
that
we
can
assimilate
validate
corroborate
and
verify
false
ideas
are
those
that
we
can
not
that
is
the
practical
difference
it
makes
to
us
to
have
true
ideas
that
therefore
is
the
meaning
of
truth
for
it
is
all
that
truth
is
this
thesis
is
what
i
have
to
defend
the
truth
of
an
idea
is
not
a
stagnant
property
inherent
in
it
truth
happens
to
an
idea
it
becomes
true
is
made
true
by
events
its
verity
is
in
fact
an
event
a
process
the
process
namely
of
its
verifying
itself
its
its
validity
is
the
process
of
its
but
what
do
the
words
verification
and
validation
themselves
pragmatically
mean
they
again
signify
certain
practical
consequences
of
the
verified
and
validated
idea
it
is
hard
to
find
any
one
phrase
that
characterizes
these
consequences
better
than
the
ordinary
just
such
consequences
being
what
we
have
in
mind
whenever
we
say
that
our
ideas
with
reality
they
lead
us
namely
through
the
acts
and
other
ideas
which
they
instigate
into
or
up
to
or
towards
other
parts
of
experience
with
which
we
feel
all
the
feeling
being
among
our
potentialities
that
the
original
ideas
remain
in
agreement
the
connexions
and
transitions
come
to
us
from
point
to
point
as
being
progressive
harmonious
satisfactory
this
function
of
agreeable
leading
is
what
we
mean
by
an
idea
verification
such
an
account
is
vague
and
it
sounds
at
first
quite
trivial
but
it
has
results
which
it
will
take
the
rest
of
my
hour
to
explain
let
me
begin
by
reminding
you
of
the
fact
that
the
possession
of
true
thoughts
means
everywhere
the
possession
of
invaluable
instruments
of
action
and
that
our
duty
to
gain
truth
so
far
from
being
a
blank
command
from
out
of
the
blue
or
a
by
our
intellect
can
account
for
itself
by
excellent
practical
reasons
the
importance
to
human
life
of
having
true
beliefs
about
matters
of
fact
is
a
thing
too
notorious
we
live
in
a
world
of
realities
that
can
be
infinitely
useful
or
infinitely
harmful
ideas
that
tell
us
which
of
them
to
expect
count
as
the
true
ideas
in
all
this
primary
sphere
of
verification
and
the
pursuit
of
such
ideas
is
a
primary
human
duty
the
possession
of
truth
so
far
from
being
here
an
end
in
itself
is
only
a
preliminary
means
towards
other
vital
satisfactions
if
i
am
lost
in
the
woods
and
starved
and
find
what
looks
like
a
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
i
should
think
of
a
human
habitation
at
the
end
of
it
for
if
i
do
so
and
follow
it
i
save
myself
the
true
thought
is
useful
here
because
the
house
which
is
its
object
is
useful
the
practical
value
of
true
ideas
is
thus
primarily
derived
from
the
practical
importance
of
their
objects
to
us
their
objects
are
indeed
not
important
at
all
times
i
may
on
another
occasion
have
no
use
for
the
house
and
then
my
idea
of
it
however
verifiable
will
be
practically
irrelevant
and
had
better
remain
latent
yet
since
almost
any
object
may
some
day
become
temporarily
important
the
advantage
of
having
a
general
stock
of
extra
truths
of
ideas
that
shall
be
true
of
merely
possible
situations
is
obvious
we
store
such
extra
truths
away
in
our
memories
and
with
the
overflow
we
fill
our
books
of
reference
whenever
such
an
extra
truth
becomes
practically
relevant
to
one
of
our
emergencies
it
passes
from
to
do
work
in
the
world
and
our
belief
in
it
grows
active
you
can
say
of
it
then
either
that
is
useful
because
it
is
true
or
that
is
true
because
it
is
useful
both
these
phrases
mean
exactly
the
same
thing
namely
that
here
is
an
idea
that
gets
fulfilled
and
can
be
verified
true
is
the
name
for
whatever
idea
starts
the
useful
is
the
name
for
its
completed
function
in
experience
true
ideas
would
never
have
been
singled
out
as
such
would
never
have
acquired
a
least
of
all
a
name
suggesting
value
unless
they
had
been
useful
from
the
outset
in
this
way
from
this
simple
cue
pragmatism
gets
her
general
notion
of
truth
as
something
essentially
bound
up
with
the
way
in
which
one
moment
in
our
experience
may
lead
us
towards
other
moments
which
it
will
be
worth
while
to
have
been
led
to
primarily
and
on
the
level
the
truth
of
a
state
of
mind
means
this
function
of
a
leading
that
is
worth
while
when
a
moment
in
our
experience
of
any
kind
whatever
inspires
us
with
a
thought
that
is
true
that
means
that
sooner
or
later
we
dip
by
that
thought
guidance
into
the
particulars
of
experience
again
and
make
advantageous
connexion
with
them
this
is
a
vague
enough
statement
but
i
beg
you
to
retain
it
for
it
is
essential
our
experience
meanwhile
is
all
shot
through
with
regularities
one
bit
of
it
can
warn
us
to
get
ready
for
another
bit
can
or
be
of
that
remoter
object
the
object
advent
is
the
significance
verification
truth
in
these
cases
meaning
nothing
but
eventual
verification
is
manifestly
incompatible
with
waywardness
on
our
part
woe
to
him
whose
beliefs
play
fast
and
loose
with
the
order
which
realities
follow
in
his
experience
they
will
lead
him
nowhere
or
else
make
false
connexions
by
or
here
we
mean
either
things
of
common
sense
sensibly
present
or
else
relations
such
as
dates
places
distances
kinds
activities
following
our
mental
image
of
a
house
along
the
we
actually
come
to
see
the
house
we
get
the
image
full
verification
such
simply
and
fully
verified
leadings
are
certainly
the
originals
and
prototypes
of
the
experience
offers
indeed
other
forms
of
but
they
are
all
conceivable
as
being
primary
verifications
arrested
multiplied
or
substituted
one
for
another
take
for
instance
yonder
object
on
the
wall
you
and
i
consider
it
to
be
a
altho
no
one
of
us
has
seen
the
hidden
works
that
make
it
one
we
let
our
notion
pass
for
true
without
attempting
to
verify
if
truths
mean
essentially
ought
we
then
to
call
such
unverified
truths
as
this
abortive
no
for
they
form
the
overwhelmingly
large
number
of
the
truths
we
live
by
indirect
as
well
as
direct
verifications
pass
muster
where
circumstantial
evidence
is
sufficient
we
can
go
without
just
as
we
here
assume
japan
to
exist
without
ever
having
been
there
because
it
works
to
do
so
everything
we
know
conspiring
with
the
belief
and
nothing
interfering
so
we
assume
that
thing
to
be
a
clock
we
use
it
as
a
clock
regulating
the
length
of
our
lecture
by
it
the
verification
of
the
assumption
here
means
its
leading
to
no
frustration
or
contradiction
verifiability
of
wheels
and
weights
and
pendulum
is
as
good
as
verification
for
one
completed
there
are
a
million
in
our
lives
that
function
in
this
state
of
nascency
they
turn
us
towards
direct
verification
lead
us
into
the
surroundings
of
the
objects
they
envisage
and
then
if
everything
runs
on
harmoniously
we
are
so
sure
that
verification
is
possible
that
we
omit
it
and
are
usually
justified
by
all
that
happens
truth
lives
in
fact
for
the
most
part
on
a
credit
system
our
thoughts
and
beliefs
so
long
as
nothing
challenges
them
just
as
pass
so
long
as
nobody
refuses
them
but
this
all
points
to
direct
verifications
somewhere
without
which
the
fabric
of
truth
collapses
like
a
financial
system
with
no
whatever
you
accept
my
verification
of
one
thing
i
yours
of
another
we
trade
on
each
other
truth
but
beliefs
verified
concretely
by
somebody
are
the
posts
of
the
whole
superstructure
another
great
reason
beside
economy
of
time
for
waiving
complete
verification
in
the
usual
business
of
life
is
that
all
things
exist
in
kinds
and
not
singly
our
world
is
found
once
for
all
to
have
that
peculiarity
so
that
when
we
have
once
directly
verified
our
ideas
about
one
specimen
of
a
kind
we
consider
ourselves
free
to
apply
them
to
other
specimens
without
verification
a
mind
that
habitually
discerns
the
kind
of
thing
before
it
and
acts
by
the
law
of
the
kind
immediately
without
pausing
to
verify
will
be
a
mind
in
out
of
a
hundred
emergencies
proved
so
by
its
conduct
fitting
everything
it
meets
and
getting
no
refutation
indirectly
or
only
potentially
verifying
processes
may
thus
be
true
as
well
as
full
they
work
as
true
processes
would
work
give
us
the
same
advantages
and
claim
our
recognition
for
the
same
reasons
all
this
on
the
level
of
matters
of
fact
which
we
are
alone
considering
but
matters
of
fact
are
not
our
only
stock
in
trade
relations
among
purely
mental
ideas
form
another
sphere
where
true
and
false
beliefs
obtain
and
here
the
beliefs
are
absolute
or
unconditional
when
they
are
true
they
bear
the
name
either
of
definitions
or
of
principles
it
is
either
a
principle
or
a
definition
that
and
make
that
and
make
and
so
on
that
white
differs
less
from
gray
than
it
does
from
black
that
when
the
cause
begins
to
act
the
effect
also
commences
such
propositions
hold
of
all
possible
of
all
conceivable
and
and
the
objects
here
are
mental
objects
their
relations
are
perceptually
obvious
at
a
glance
and
no
is
necessary
moreover
once
true
always
true
of
those
same
mental
objects
truth
here
has
an
character
if
you
can
find
a
concrete
thing
anywhere
that
is
or
or
or
an
then
your
principles
will
everlastingly
apply
to
it
it
is
but
a
case
of
ascertaining
the
kind
and
then
applying
the
law
of
its
kind
to
the
particular
object
you
are
sure
to
get
truth
if
you
can
but
name
the
kind
rightly
for
your
mental
relations
hold
good
of
everything
of
that
kind
without
exception
if
you
then
nevertheless
failed
to
get
truth
concretely
you
would
say
that
you
had
classed
your
real
objects
wrongly
in
this
realm
of
mental
relations
truth
again
is
an
affair
of
leading
we
relate
one
abstract
idea
with
another
framing
in
the
end
great
systems
of
logical
and
mathematical
truth
under
the
respective
terms
of
which
the
sensible
facts
of
experience
eventually
arrange
themselves
so
that
our
eternal
truths
hold
good
of
realities
also
this
marriage
of
fact
and
theory
is
endlessly
fertile
what
we
say
is
here
already
true
in
advance
of
special
verification
if
we
have
subsumed
our
objects
rightly
our
ideal
framework
for
all
sorts
of
possible
objects
follows
from
the
very
structure
of
our
thinking
we
can
no
more
play
fast
and
loose
with
these
abstract
relations
than
we
can
do
so
with
our
they
coerce
us
we
must
treat
them
consistently
whether
or
not
we
like
the
results
the
rules
of
addition
apply
to
our
debts
as
rigorously
as
to
our
assets
the
hundredth
decimal
of
pi
the
ratio
of
the
circumference
to
its
diameter
is
predetermined
ideally
now
tho
no
one
may
have
computed
it
if
we
should
ever
need
the
figure
in
our
dealings
with
an
actual
circle
we
should
need
to
have
it
given
rightly
calculated
by
the
usual
rules
for
it
is
the
same
kind
of
truth
that
those
rules
elsewhere
calculate
between
the
coercions
of
the
sensible
order
and
those
of
the
ideal
order
our
mind
is
thus
wedged
tightly
our
ideas
must
agree
with
realities
be
such
realities
concrete
or
abstract
be
they
facts
or
be
they
principles
under
penalty
of
endless
inconsistency
and
frustration
so
far
intellectualists
can
raise
no
protest
they
can
only
say
that
we
have
barely
touched
the
skin
of
the
matter
realities
mean
then
either
concrete
facts
or
abstract
kinds
of
things
and
relations
perceived
intuitively
between
them
they
furthermore
and
thirdly
mean
as
things
that
new
ideas
of
ours
must
no
less
take
account
of
the
whole
body
of
other
truths
already
in
our
possession
but
what
now
does
with
such
realities
mean
to
use
again
the
definition
that
is
current
here
it
is
that
pragmatism
and
intellectualism
begin
to
part
company
primarily
no
doubt
to
agree
means
to
copy
but
we
saw
that
the
mere
word
would
do
instead
of
a
mental
picture
of
its
works
and
that
of
many
realities
our
ideas
can
only
be
symbols
and
not
copies
time
how
can
our
mind
copy
such
realities
to
in
the
widest
sense
with
a
reality
can
only
mean
to
be
guided
either
straight
up
to
it
or
into
its
surroundings
or
to
be
put
into
such
working
touch
with
it
as
to
handle
either
it
or
something
connected
with
it
better
than
if
we
disagreed
better
either
intellectually
or
practically
and
often
agreement
will
only
mean
the
negative
fact
that
nothing
contradictory
from
the
quarter
of
that
reality
comes
to
interfere
with
the
way
in
which
our
ideas
guide
us
elsewhere
to
copy
a
reality
is
indeed
one
very
important
way
of
agreeing
with
it
but
it
is
far
from
being
essential
the
essential
thing
is
the
process
of
being
guided
any
idea
that
helps
us
to
deal
whether
practically
or
intellectually
with
either
the
reality
or
its
belongings
that
does
entangle
our
progress
in
frustrations
that
fits
in
fact
and
adapts
our
life
to
the
reality
whole
setting
will
agree
sufficiently
to
meet
the
requirement
it
will
hold
true
of
that
reality
thus
names
are
just
as
or
as
definite
mental
pictures
are
they
set
up
similar
and
lead
to
fully
equivalent
practical
results
all
human
thinking
gets
discursified
we
exchange
ideas
we
lend
and
borrow
verifications
get
them
from
one
another
by
means
of
social
intercourse
all
truth
thus
gets
verbally
built
out
stored
up
and
made
available
for
everyone
hence
we
must
talk
consistently
just
as
we
must
think
consistently
for
both
in
talk
and
thought
we
deal
with
kinds
names
are
arbitrary
but
once
understood
they
must
be
kept
to
we
must
now
call
abel
or
cain
if
we
do
we
ungear
ourselves
from
the
whole
book
of
genesis
and
from
all
its
connexions
with
the
universe
of
speech
and
fact
down
to
the
present
time
we
throw
ourselves
out
of
whatever
truth
that
entire
system
of
speech
and
fact
may
embody
the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
true
ideas
admit
of
no
direct
or
of
past
history
for
example
as
of
cain
and
abel
the
stream
of
time
can
be
remounted
only
verbally
or
verified
indirectly
by
the
present
prolongations
or
effects
of
what
the
past
harbored
yet
if
they
agree
with
these
verbalities
and
effects
we
can
know
that
our
ideas
of
the
past
are
true
as
true
as
past
time
itself
was
so
true
was
julius
caesar
so
true
were
antediluvian
monsters
all
in
their
proper
dates
and
settings
that
past
time
itself
was
is
guaranteed
by
its
coherence
with
everything
that
present
true
as
the
present
is
the
past
was
also
agreement
thus
turns
out
to
be
essentially
an
affair
of
leading
leading
that
is
useful
because
it
is
into
quarters
that
contain
objects
that
are
important
true
ideas
lead
us
into
useful
verbal
and
conceptual
quarters
as
well
as
directly
up
to
useful
sensible
termini
they
lead
to
consistency
stability
and
flowing
human
intercourse
they
lead
away
from
excentricity
and
isolation
from
foiled
and
barren
thinking
the
untrammeled
flowing
of
the
its
general
freedom
from
clash
and
contradiction
passes
for
its
indirect
verification
but
all
roads
lead
to
rome
and
in
the
end
and
eventually
all
true
processes
must
lead
to
the
face
of
directly
verifying
sensible
experiences
somewhere
which
somebody
ideas
have
copied
such
is
the
large
loose
way
in
which
the
pragmatist
interprets
the
word
agreement
he
treats
it
altogether
practically
he
lets
it
cover
any
process
of
conduction
from
a
present
idea
to
a
future
terminus
provided
only
it
run
prosperously
it
is
only
thus
that
ideas
flying
as
they
do
beyond
common
sense
can
be
said
to
agree
with
their
realities
it
is
as
i
have
already
said
as
if
reality
were
made
of
ether
atoms
or
electrons
but
we
must
think
so
literally
the
term
does
even
pretend
to
stand
for
anything
it
is
only
a
way
of
measuring
the
surface
of
phenomena
so
as
to
string
their
changes
on
a
simple
formula
yet
in
the
choice
of
these
formulas
we
can
not
be
capricious
with
impunity
any
more
than
we
can
be
capricious
on
the
practical
level
we
must
find
a
theory
that
will
work
and
that
means
something
extremely
difficult
for
our
theory
must
mediate
between
all
previous
truths
and
certain
new
experiences
it
must
derange
common
sense
and
previous
belief
as
little
as
possible
and
it
must
lead
to
some
sensible
terminus
or
other
that
can
be
verified
exactly
to
means
both
these
things
and
the
squeeze
is
so
tight
that
there
is
little
loose
play
for
any
hypothesis
our
theories
are
wedged
and
controlled
as
nothing
else
is
yet
sometimes
alternative
theoretic
formulas
are
equally
compatible
with
all
the
truths
we
know
and
then
we
choose
between
them
for
subjective
reasons
we
choose
the
kind
of
theory
to
which
we
are
already
partial
we
follow
or
clerk
maxwell
somewhere
says
it
would
be
poor
scientific
taste
to
choose
the
more
complicated
of
two
equally
conceptions
and
you
will
all
agree
with
him
truth
in
science
is
what
gives
us
the
maximum
possible
sum
of
satisfactions
taste
included
but
consistency
both
with
previous
truth
and
with
novel
fact
is
always
the
most
imperious
claimant
i
have
led
you
through
a
very
sandy
desert
but
now
if
i
may
be
allowed
so
vulgar
an
expression
we
begin
to
taste
the
milk
in
the
cocoanut
our
rationalist
critics
here
discharge
their
batteries
upon
us
and
to
reply
to
them
will
take
us
out
from
all
this
dryness
into
full
sight
of
a
momentous
philosophical
alternative
our
account
of
truth
is
an
account
of
truths
in
the
plural
of
processes
of
leading
realized
in
rebus
and
having
only
this
quality
in
common
that
they
pay
they
pay
by
guiding
us
into
or
towards
some
part
of
a
system
that
dips
at
numerous
points
into
which
we
may
copy
mentally
or
not
but
with
which
at
any
rate
we
are
now
in
the
kind
of
commerce
vaguely
designated
as
verification
truth
for
us
is
simply
a
collective
name
for
just
as
health
wealth
strength
are
names
for
other
processes
connected
with
life
and
also
pursued
because
it
pays
to
pursue
them
truth
is
made
just
as
health
wealth
and
strength
are
made
in
the
course
of
experience
here
rationalism
is
instantaneously
up
in
arms
against
us
i
can
imagine
a
rationalist
to
talk
as
follows
truth
is
not
made
he
will
say
it
absolutely
obtains
being
a
unique
relation
that
does
not
wait
upon
any
process
but
shoots
straight
over
the
head
of
experience
and
hits
its
reality
every
time
our
belief
that
yon
thing
on
the
wall
is
a
clock
is
true
already
altho
no
one
in
the
whole
history
of
the
world
should
verify
it
the
bare
quality
of
standing
in
that
transcendent
relation
is
what
makes
any
thought
true
that
possesses
it
whether
or
not
there
be
verification
you
pragmatists
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
in
making
truth
being
reside
in
these
are
merely
signs
of
its
being
merely
our
lame
ways
of
ascertaining
after
the
fact
which
of
our
ideas
already
has
possessed
the
wondrous
quality
the
quality
itself
is
timeless
like
all
essences
and
natures
thoughts
partake
of
it
directly
as
they
partake
of
falsity
or
of
irrelevancy
it
ca
be
analyzed
away
into
pragmatic
consequences
the
whole
plausibility
of
this
rationalist
tirade
is
due
to
the
fact
to
which
we
have
already
paid
so
much
attention
in
our
world
namely
abounding
as
it
does
in
things
of
similar
kinds
and
similarly
associated
one
verification
serves
for
others
of
its
kind
and
one
great
use
of
knowing
things
is
to
be
led
not
so
much
to
them
as
to
their
associates
especially
to
human
talk
about
them
the
quality
of
truth
obtaining
ante
rem
pragmatically
means
then
the
fact
that
in
such
a
world
innumerable
ideas
work
better
by
their
indirect
or
possible
than
by
their
direct
and
actual
verification
truth
ante
rem
means
only
verifiability
then
or
else
it
is
a
case
of
the
stock
rationalist
trick
of
treating
the
name
of
a
concrete
phenomenal
reality
as
an
independent
prior
entity
and
placing
it
behind
the
reality
as
its
explanation
professor
mach
quotes
somewhere
an
epigram
of
lessing
sagt
hanschen
schlau
zu
vetter

wie
kommt
es
vetter
fritzen
dass
grad
die
reichsten
in
der

here
treats
the
principle
as
something
distinct
from
the
facts
denoted
by
the
man
being
rich
it
antedates
them
the
facts
become
only
a
sort
of
secondary
coincidence
with
the
rich
essential
nature
in
the
case
of
we
all
see
the
fallacy
we
know
that
wealth
is
but
a
name
for
concrete
processes
that
certain
men
lives
play
a
part
in
and
not
a
natural
excellence
found
in
rockefeller
and
carnegie
but
not
in
the
rest
of
us
like
wealth
health
also
lives
in
rebus
it
is
a
name
for
processes
as
digestion
circulation
sleep
that
go
on
happily
tho
in
this
instance
we
are
more
inclined
to
think
of
it
as
a
principle
and
to
say
the
man
digests
and
sleeps
so
well
because
he
is
so
healthy
with
we
are
i
think
more
rationalistic
still
and
decidedly
inclined
to
treat
it
as
an
excellence
in
the
man
and
explanatory
of
the
herculean
performances
of
his
muscles
with
most
people
go
over
the
border
entirely
and
treat
the
rationalistic
account
as
but
really
all
these
words
in
th
are
exactly
similar
truth
exists
ante
rem
just
as
much
and
as
little
as
the
other
things
do
the
scholastics
following
aristotle
made
much
of
the
distinction
between
habit
and
act
health
in
actu
means
among
other
things
good
sleeping
and
digesting
but
a
healthy
man
need
not
always
be
sleeping
or
always
digesting
any
more
than
a
wealthy
man
need
be
always
handling
money
or
a
strong
man
always
lifting
weights
all
such
qualities
sink
to
the
status
of
between
their
times
of
exercise
and
similarly
truth
becomes
a
habit
of
certain
of
our
ideas
and
beliefs
in
their
intervals
of
rest
from
their
verifying
activities
but
those
activities
are
the
root
of
the
whole
matter
and
the
condition
of
there
being
any
habit
to
exist
in
the
intervals
true
to
put
it
very
briefly
is
only
the
expedient
in
the
way
of
our
thinking
just
as
right
is
only
the
expedient
in
the
way
of
our
behaving
expedient
in
almost
any
fashion
and
expedient
in
the
long
run
and
on
the
whole
of
course
for
what
meets
expediently
all
the
experience
in
sight
wo
necessarily
meet
all
farther
experiences
equally
satisfactorily
experience
as
we
know
has
ways
of
boiling
over
and
making
us
correct
our
present
formulas
the
true
meaning
what
no
farther
experience
will
ever
alter
is
that
ideal
towards
which
we
imagine
that
all
our
temporary
truths
will
some
day
converge
it
runs
on
all
fours
with
the
perfectly
wise
man
and
with
the
absolutely
complete
experience
and
if
these
ideals
are
ever
realized
they
will
all
be
realized
together
meanwhile
we
have
to
live
by
what
truth
we
can
get
and
be
ready
to
call
it
falsehood
ptolemaic
astronomy
euclidean
space
aristotelian
logic
scholastic
metaphysics
were
expedient
for
centuries
but
human
experience
has
boiled
over
those
limits
and
we
now
call
these
things
only
relatively
true
or
true
within
those
borders
of
experience
they
are
false
for
we
know
that
those
limits
were
casual
and
might
have
been
transcended
by
past
theorists
just
as
they
are
by
present
thinkers
when
new
experiences
lead
to
retrospective
judgments
using
the
past
tense
what
these
judgments
utter
was
true
even
tho
no
past
thinker
had
been
led
there
we
live
forwards
a
danish
thinker
has
said
but
we
understand
backwards
the
present
sheds
a
backward
light
on
the
previous
processes
they
may
have
been
for
the
actors
in
them
they
are
not
so
for
one
who
knows
the
later
revelations
of
the
story
this
regulative
notion
of
a
potential
better
truth
to
be
established
later
possibly
to
be
established
some
day
absolutely
and
having
powers
of
retroactive
legislation
turns
its
face
like
all
pragmatist
notions
towards
concreteness
of
fact
and
towards
the
future
like
the
the
absolute
truth
will
have
to
be
made
made
as
a
relation
incidental
to
the
growth
of
a
mass
of
to
which
the
ideas
are
all
along
contributing
their
quota
i
have
already
insisted
on
the
fact
that
truth
is
made
largely
out
of
previous
truths
men
beliefs
at
any
time
are
so
much
experience
funded
but
the
beliefs
are
themselves
parts
of
the
sum
total
of
the
world
experience
and
become
matter
therefore
for
the
next
funding
operations
so
far
as
reality
means
experienceable
reality
both
it
and
the
truths
men
gain
about
it
are
everlastingly
in
process
of
towards
a
definite
goal
it
may
be
but
still
mutation
mathematicians
can
solve
problems
with
two
variables
on
the
newtonian
theory
for
instance
acceleration
varies
with
distance
but
distance
also
varies
with
acceleration
in
the
realm
of
facts
come
independently
and
determine
our
beliefs
provisionally
but
these
beliefs
make
us
act
and
as
fast
as
they
do
so
they
bring
into
sight
or
into
existence
new
facts
which
the
beliefs
accordingly
so
the
whole
coil
and
ball
of
truth
as
it
rolls
up
is
the
product
of
a
double
influence
truths
emerge
from
facts
but
they
dip
forward
into
facts
again
and
add
to
them
which
facts
again
create
or
reveal
new
truth
the
word
is
indifferent
and
so
on
indefinitely
the
themselves
meanwhile
are
not
true
they
simply
are
truth
is
the
function
of
the
beliefs
that
start
and
terminate
among
them
the
case
is
like
a
snowball
growth
due
as
it
is
to
the
distribution
of
the
snow
on
the
one
hand
and
to
the
successive
pushes
of
the
boys
on
the
other
with
these
factors
each
other
incessantly
the
most
fateful
point
of
difference
between
being
a
rationalist
and
being
a
pragmatist
is
now
fully
in
sight
experience
is
in
mutation
and
our
psychological
ascertainments
of
truth
are
in
mutation
so
much
rationalism
will
allow
but
never
that
either
reality
itself
or
truth
itself
is
mutable
reality
stands
complete
and
from
all
eternity
rationalism
insists
and
the
agreement
of
our
ideas
with
it
is
that
unique
unanalyzable
virtue
in
them
of
which
she
has
already
told
us
as
that
intrinsic
excellence
their
truth
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
experiences
it
adds
nothing
to
the
content
of
experience
it
makes
no
difference
to
reality
itself
it
is
supervenient
inert
static
a
reflexion
merely
it
does
exist
it
holds
or
obtains
it
belongs
to
another
dimension
from
that
of
either
facts
or
belongs
in
short
to
the
epistemological
dimension
and
with
that
big
word
rationalism
closes
the
discussion
thus
just
as
pragmatism
faces
forward
to
the
future
so
does
rationalism
here
again
face
backward
to
a
past
eternity
true
to
her
inveterate
habit
rationalism
reverts
to
and
thinks
that
when
an
abstraction
once
is
named
we
own
an
oracular
solution
the
tremendous
pregnancy
in
the
way
of
consequences
for
life
of
this
radical
difference
of
outlook
will
only
become
apparent
in
my
later
lectures
i
wish
meanwhile
to
close
this
lecture
by
showing
that
rationalism
sublimity
does
not
save
it
from
inanity
when
namely
you
ask
rationalists
instead
of
accusing
pragmatism
of
desecrating
the
notion
of
truth
to
define
it
themselves
by
saying
exactly
what
they
understand
by
it
the
only
positive
attempts
i
can
think
of
are
these
two
truth
is
just
the
system
of
propositions
which
have
an
claim
to
be
recognized
as
valid

the
first
thing
that
strikes
one
in
such
definitions
is
their
unutterable
triviality
they
are
absolutely
true
of
course
but
absolutely
insignificant
until
you
handle
them
pragmatically
what
do
you
mean
by
here
and
what
do
you
mean
by
as
summary
names
for
the
concrete
reasons
why
thinking
in
true
ways
is
overwhelmingly
expedient
and
good
for
mortal
men
it
is
all
right
to
talk
of
claims
on
reality
part
to
be
agreed
with
and
of
obligations
on
our
part
to
agree
we
feel
both
the
claims
and
the
obligations
and
we
feel
them
for
just
those
reasons
but
the
rationalists
who
talk
of
claim
and
obligation
expressly
say
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
practical
interests
or
personal
reasons
our
reasons
for
agreeing
are
psychological
facts
they
say
relative
to
each
thinker
and
to
the
accidents
of
his
life
they
are
his
evidence
merely
they
are
no
part
of
the
life
of
truth
itself
that
life
transacts
itself
in
a
purely
logical
or
epistemological
as
distinguished
from
a
psychological
dimension
and
its
claims
antedate
and
exceed
all
personal
motivations
whatsoever
tho
neither
man
nor
god
should
ever
ascertain
truth
the
word
would
still
have
to
be
defined
as
that
which
ought
to
be
ascertained
and
recognized
there
never
was
a
more
exquisite
example
of
an
idea
abstracted
from
the
concretes
of
experience
and
then
used
to
oppose
and
negate
what
it
was
abstracted
from
philosophy
and
common
life
abound
in
similar
instances
the
fallacy
is
to
shed
tears
over
abstract
justice
and
generosity
beauty
and
never
to
know
these
qualities
when
you
meet
them
in
the
street
because
there
the
circumstances
make
them
vulgar
thus
i
read
in
the
privately
printed
biography
of
an
eminently
rationalistic
mind
it
was
strange
that
with
such
admiration
for
beauty
in
the
abstract
my
brother
had
no
enthusiasm
for
fine
architecture
for
beautiful
painting
or
for
flowers
and
in
almost
the
last
philosophic
work
i
have
read
i
find
such
passages
as
the
following
justice
is
ideal
solely
ideal
reason
conceives
that
it
ought
to
exist
but
experience
shows
that
it
truth
which
ought
to
be
can
not
be
reason
is
deformed
by
experience
as
soon
as
reason
enters
experience
it
becomes
contrary
to
reason
the
rationalist
fallacy
here
is
exactly
like
the
sentimentalist
both
extract
a
quality
from
the
muddy
particulars
of
experience
and
find
it
so
pure
when
extracted
that
they
contrast
it
with
each
and
all
its
muddy
instances
as
an
opposite
and
higher
nature
all
the
while
it
is
their
nature
it
is
the
nature
of
truths
to
be
validated
verified
it
pays
for
our
ideas
to
be
validated
our
obligation
to
seek
truth
is
part
of
our
general
obligation
to
do
what
pays
the
payments
true
ideas
bring
are
the
sole
why
of
our
duty
to
follow
them
identical
whys
exist
in
the
case
of
wealth
and
health
truth
makes
no
other
kind
of
claim
and
imposes
no
other
kind
of
ought
than
health
and
wealth
do
all
these
claims
are
conditional
the
concrete
benefits
we
gain
are
what
we
mean
by
calling
the
pursuit
a
duty
in
the
case
of
truth
untrue
beliefs
work
as
perniciously
in
the
long
run
as
true
beliefs
work
beneficially
talking
abstractly
the
quality
may
thus
be
said
to
grow
absolutely
precious
and
the
quality
absolutely
damnable
the
one
may
be
called
good
the
other
bad
unconditionally
we
ought
to
think
the
true
we
ought
to
shun
the
false
imperatively
but
if
we
treat
all
this
abstraction
literally
and
oppose
it
to
its
mother
soil
in
experience
see
what
a
preposterous
position
we
work
ourselves
into
we
can
not
then
take
a
step
forward
in
our
actual
thinking
when
shall
i
acknowledge
this
truth
and
when
that
shall
the
acknowledgment
be
loud
or
silent
if
sometimes
loud
sometimes
silent
which
now
when
may
a
truth
go
into
in
the
encyclopedia
and
when
shall
it
come
out
for
battle
must
i
constantly
be
repeating
the
truth
two
are
four
because
of
its
eternal
claim
on
recognition
or
is
it
sometimes
irrelevant
must
my
thoughts
dwell
night
and
day
on
my
personal
sins
and
blemishes
because
i
truly
have
them
or
may
i
sink
and
ignore
them
in
order
to
be
a
decent
social
unit
and
not
a
mass
of
morbid
melancholy
and
apology
it
is
quite
evident
that
our
obligation
to
acknowledge
truth
so
far
from
being
unconditional
is
tremendously
conditioned
truth
with
a
big
t
and
in
the
singular
claims
abstractly
to
be
recognized
of
course
but
concrete
truths
in
the
plural
need
be
recognized
only
when
their
recognition
is
expedient
a
truth
must
always
be
preferred
to
a
falsehood
when
both
relate
to
the
situation
but
when
neither
does
truth
is
as
little
of
a
duty
as
falsehood
if
you
ask
me
what
it
is
and
i
tell
you
that
i
live
at
irving
street
my
answer
may
indeed
be
true
but
you
do
see
why
it
is
my
duty
to
give
it
a
false
address
would
be
as
much
to
the
purpose
with
this
admission
that
there
are
conditions
that
limit
the
application
of
the
abstract
imperative
the
pragmatistic
treatment
of
truth
sweeps
back
upon
us
in
its
fulness
our
duty
to
agree
with
reality
is
seen
to
be
grounded
in
a
perfect
jungle
of
concrete
expediencies
when
berkeley
had
explained
what
people
meant
by
matter
people
thought
that
he
denied
matter
existence
when
schiller
and
dewey
now
explain
what
people
mean
by
truth
they
are
accused
of
denying
its
existence
these
pragmatists
destroy
all
objective
standards
critics
say
and
put
foolishness
and
wisdom
on
one
level
a
favorite
formula
for
describing
schiller
doctrines
and
mine
is
that
we
are
persons
who
think
that
by
saying
whatever
you
find
it
pleasant
to
say
and
calling
it
truth
you
fulfil
every
pragmatistic
requirement
i
leave
it
to
you
to
judge
whether
this
be
not
an
impudent
slander
pent
in
as
the
pragmatist
more
than
anyone
else
sees
himself
to
be
between
the
whole
body
of
funded
truths
squeezed
from
the
past
and
the
coercions
of
the
world
of
sense
about
him
who
so
well
as
he
feels
the
immense
pressure
of
objective
control
under
which
our
minds
perform
their
operations
if
anyone
imagines
that
this
law
is
lax
let
him
keep
its
commandment
one
day
says
emerson
we
have
heard
much
of
late
of
the
uses
of
the
imagination
in
science
it
is
high
time
to
urge
the
use
of
a
little
imagination
in
philosophy
the
unwillingness
of
some
of
our
critics
to
read
any
but
the
silliest
of
possible
meanings
into
our
statements
is
as
discreditable
to
their
imaginations
as
anything
i
know
in
recent
philosophic
history
schiller
says
the
true
is
that
which
thereupon
he
is
treated
as
one
who
limits
verification
to
the
lowest
material
utilities
dewey
says
truth
is
what
gives
he
is
treated
as
one
who
believes
in
calling
everything
true
which
if
it
were
true
would
be
pleasant
our
critics
certainly
need
more
imagination
of
realities
i
have
honestly
tried
to
stretch
my
own
imagination
and
to
read
the
best
possible
meaning
into
the
rationalist
conception
but
i
have
to
confess
that
it
still
completely
baffles
me
the
notion
of
a
reality
calling
on
us
to
with
it
and
that
for
no
reasons
but
simply
because
its
claim
is
or
is
one
that
i
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
i
try
to
imagine
myself
as
the
sole
reality
in
the
world
and
then
to
imagine
what
more
i
would
if
i
were
allowed
to
if
you
suggest
the
possibility
of
my
claiming
that
a
mind
should
come
into
being
from
out
of
the
void
inane
and
stand
and
copy
me
i
can
indeed
imagine
what
the
copying
might
mean
but
i
can
conjure
up
no
motive
what
good
it
would
do
me
to
be
copied
or
what
good
it
would
do
that
mind
to
copy
me
if
farther
consequences
are
expressly
and
in
principle
ruled
out
as
motives
for
the
claim
as
they
are
by
our
rationalist
authorities
i
can
not
fathom
when
the
irishman
admirers
ran
him
along
to
the
place
of
banquet
in
a
sedan
chair
with
no
bottom
he
said
faith
if
it
was
for
the
honor
of
the
thing
i
might
as
well
have
come
on
foot
so
here
but
for
the
honor
of
the
thing
i
might
as
well
have
remained
uncopied
copying
is
one
genuine
mode
of
knowing
which
for
some
strange
reason
our
contemporary
transcendentalists
seem
to
be
tumbling
over
each
other
to
repudiate
but
when
we
get
beyond
copying
and
fall
back
on
unnamed
forms
of
agreeing
that
are
expressly
denied
to
be
either
copyings
or
leadings
or
fittings
or
any
other
processes
pragmatically
definable
the
what
of
the
claimed
becomes
as
unintelligible
as
the
why
of
it
neither
content
nor
motive
can
be
imagined
for
it
it
is
an
absolutely
meaningless
abstraction
footnote
i
am
not
forgetting
that
professor
rickert
long
ago
gave
up
the
whole
notion
of
truth
being
founded
on
agreement
with
reality
reality
according
to
him
is
whatever
agrees
with
truth
and
truth
is
founded
solely
on
our
primal
duty
this
fantastic
flight
together
with
joachim
candid
confession
of
failure
in
his
book
the
nature
of
truth
seems
to
me
to
mark
the
bankruptcy
of
rationalism
when
dealing
with
this
subject
rickert
deals
with
part
of
the
pragmatistic
position
under
the
head
of
what
he
calls
i
can
not
discuss
his
text
here
suffice
it
to
say
that
his
argumentation
in
that
chapter
is
so
feeble
as
to
seem
almost
incredible
in
so
generally
able
a
writer
surely
in
this
field
of
truth
it
is
the
pragmatists
and
not
the
rationalists
who
are
the
more
genuine
defenders
of
the
rationality
lecture
vii
pragmatism
and
humanism
what
hardens
the
heart
of
everyone
i
approach
with
the
view
of
truth
sketched
in
my
last
lecture
is
that
typical
idol
of
the
tribe
the
notion
of
the
truth
conceived
as
the
one
answer
determinate
and
complete
to
the
one
fixed
enigma
which
the
world
is
believed
to
propound
for
popular
tradition
it
is
all
the
better
if
the
answer
be
oracular
so
as
itself
to
awaken
wonder
as
an
enigma
of
the
second
order
veiling
rather
than
revealing
what
its
profundities
are
supposed
to
contain

the

that
men
have
lavished
on
them
from
this
oracular
role
by
amateurs
in

and
professionals
alike
the
universe
is
represented
as
a
queer
sort
of
petrified
sphinx
whose
appeal
to
man
consists
in
a
monotonous
challenge
to
his
divining
powers
the
truth
what
a
perfect
idol
of
the
rationalistic
mind
i
read
in
an
old
letter
from
a
gifted
friend
who
died
too
young
these
words
in
everything
in
science
art
morals
and
religion
there
must
be
one
system
that
is
right
and
every
other
wrong
how
characteristic
of
the
enthusiasm
of
a
certain
stage
of
youth
at
we
rise
to
such
a
challenge
and
expect
to
find
the
system
it
never
occurs
to
most
of
us
even
later
that
the
question
is
the
truth
is
no
real
question
being
irrelative
to
all
conditions
and
that
the
whole
notion
of
the
truth
is
an
abstraction
from
the
fact
of
truths
in
the
plural
a
mere
useful
summarizing
phrase
like
the
latin
language
or
the
law
judges
sometimes
talk
about
the
law
and
talk
about
the
latin
tongue
in
a
way
to
make
their
hearers
think
they
mean
entities
to
the
decisions
or
to
the
words
and
syntax
determining
them
unequivocally
and
requiring
them
to
obey
but
the
slightest
exercise
of
reflexion
makes
us
see
that
instead
of
being
principles
of
this
kind
both
law
and
latin
are
results
distinctions
between
the
lawful
and
the
unlawful
in
conduct
or
between
the
correct
and
incorrect
in
speech
have
grown
up
incidentally
among
the
interactions
of
men
experiences
in
detail
and
in
no
other
way
do
distinctions
between
the
true
and
the
false
in
belief
ever
grow
up
truth
grafts
itself
on
previous
truth
modifying
it
in
the
process
just
as
idiom
grafts
itself
on
previous
idiom
and
law
on
previous
law
given
previous

and
a
novel
case
and
the
judge
will
twist
them
into
fresh

new
slang
or
metaphor
or
oddity
that
hits
the
public
taste
and
presto
a
new
idiom
is
made

fresh
facts
and
our
mind
finds
a
new
truth
all
the
while
however
we
pretend
that
the
eternal
is
unrolling
that
the
one
previous
justice
grammar
or
truth
is
simply
fulgurating
and
not
being
made
but
imagine
a
youth
in
the
courtroom
trying
cases
with
his
abstract
notion
of
law
or
a
censor
of
speech
let
loose
among
the
theatres
with
his
idea
of
or
a
professor
setting
up
to
lecture
on
the
actual
universe
with
his
rationalistic
notion
of
truth
with
a
big
t
and
what
progress
do
they
make
truth
law
and
language
fairly
boil
away
from
them
at
the
least
touch
of
novel
fact
these
things
make
themselves
as
we
go
our
rights
wrongs
prohibitions
penalties
words
forms
idioms
beliefs
are
so
many
new
creations
that
add
themselves
as
fast
as
history
proceeds
far
from
being
antecedent
principles
that
animate
the
process
law
language
truth
are
but
abstract
names
for
its
results
laws
and
languages
at
any
rate
are
thus
seen
to
be
things
schiller
applies
the
analogy
to
beliefs
and
proposes
the
name
of
for
the
doctrine
that
to
an
unascertainable
extent
our
truths
are
products
too
human
motives
sharpen
all
our
questions
human
satisfactions
lurk
in
all
our
answers
all
our
formulas
have
a
human
twist
this
element
is
so
inextricable
in
the
products
that
schiller
sometimes
seems
almost
to
leave
it
an
open
question
whether
there
be
anything
else
the
world
he
says
is
essentially
u
lambda
nu
it
is
what
we
make
of
it
it
is
fruitless
to
define
it
by
what
it
originally
was
or
by
what
it
is
apart
from
us
it
is
what
is
made
of
it
hence
the
world
is
plastic
footnote
personal
idealism
p
he
adds
that
we
can
learn
the
limits
of
the
plasticity
only
by
trying
and
that
we
ought
to
start
as
if
it
were
wholly
plastic
acting
methodically
on
that
assumption
and
stopping
only
when
we
are
decisively
rebuked
this
is
schiller
statement
of
the
humanist
position
and
it
has
exposed
him
to
severe
attack
i
mean
to
defend
the
humanist
position
in
this
lecture
so
i
will
insinuate
a
few
remarks
at
this
point
schiller
admits
as
emphatically
as
anyone
the
presence
of
resisting
factors
in
every
actual
experience
of
of
which
the
special
truth
must
take
account
and
with
which
it
has
perforce
to
all
our
truths
are
beliefs
about
and
in
any
particular
belief
the
reality
acts
as
something
independent
as
a
thing
found
not
manufactured
let
me
here
recall
a
bit
of
my
last
lecture
is
in
general
what
truths
have
to
take
account
of
footnote
taylor
in
his
elements
of
metaphysics
uses
this
excellent
pragmatic
definition
and
the
first
part
of
reality
from
this
point
of
view
is
the
flux
of
our
sensations
sensations
are
forced
upon
us
coming
we
know
not
whence
over
their
nature
order
and
quantity
we
have
as
good
as
no
control
they
are
neither
true
nor
false
they
simply
are
it
is
only
what
we
say
about
them
only
the
names
we
give
them
our
theories
of
their
source
and
nature
and
remote
relations
that
may
be
true
or
not
the
second
part
of
reality
as
something
that
our
beliefs
must
also
obediently
take
account
of
is
the
relations
that
obtain
between
our
sensations
or
between
their
copies
in
our
minds
this
part
falls
into
two
the
relations
that
are
mutable
and
accidental
as
those
of
date
and
place
and
those
that
are
fixed
and
essential
because
they
are
grounded
on
the
inner
natures
of
their
terms
such
as
likeness
and
unlikeness
both
sorts
of
relation
are
matters
of
immediate
perception
both
are
but
it
is
the
latter
kind
of
fact
that
forms
the
more
important
of
reality
for
our
theories
of
knowledge
inner
relations
namely
are
are
perceived
whenever
their
sensible
terms
are
compared
and
of
them
our
thought
mathematical
and
logical
thought
must
eternally
take
account
the
third
part
of
reality
additional
to
these
perceptions
tho
largely
based
upon
them
is
the
previous
truths
of
which
every
new
inquiry
takes
account
this
third
part
is
a
much
less
obdurately
resisting
factor
it
often
ends
by
giving
way
in
speaking
of
these
three
portions
of
reality
as
at
all
times
controlling
our
belief
formation
i
am
only
reminding
you
of
what
we
heard
in
our
last
hour
now
however
fixed
these
elements
of
reality
may
be
we
still
have
a
certain
freedom
in
our
dealings
with
them
take
our
sensations
that
they
are
is
undoubtedly
beyond
our
control
but
which
we
attend
to
note
and
make
emphatic
in
our
conclusions
depends
on
our
own
interests
and
according
as
we
lay
the
emphasis
here
or
there
quite
different
formulations
of
truth
result
we
read
the
same
facts
differently
with
the
same
fixed
details
spells
a
for
an
englishman
for
a
frenchman
it
spells
a
so
for
an
optimist
philosopher
the
universe
spells
victory
for
a
pessimist
defeat
what
we
say
about
reality
thus
depends
on
the
perspective
into
which
we
throw
it
the
that
of
it
is
its
own
but
the
what
depends
on
the
which
and
the
which
depends
on
us
both
the
sensational
and
the
relational
parts
of
reality
are
dumb
they
say
absolutely
nothing
about
themselves
we
it
is
who
have
to
speak
for
them
this
dumbness
of
sensations
has
led
such
intellectualists
as
green
and
edward
caird
to
shove
them
almost
beyond
the
pale
of
philosophic
recognition
but
pragmatists
refuse
to
go
so
far
a
sensation
is
rather
like
a
client
who
has
given
his
case
to
a
lawyer
and
then
has
passively
to
listen
in
the
courtroom
to
whatever
account
of
his
affairs
pleasant
or
unpleasant
the
lawyer
finds
it
most
expedient
to
give
hence
even
in
the
field
of
sensation
our
minds
exert
a
certain
arbitrary
choice
by
our
inclusions
and
omissions
we
trace
the
extent
by
our
emphasis
we
mark
its
foreground
and
its
background
by
our
order
we
read
it
in
this
direction
or
in
that
we
receive
in
short
the
block
of
marble
but
we
carve
the
statue
ourselves
this
applies
to
the
parts
of
reality
as
well
we
shuffle
our
perceptions
of
intrinsic
relation
and
arrange
them
just
as
freely
we
read
them
in
one
serial
order
or
another
class
them
in
this
way
or
in
that
treat
one
or
the
other
as
more
fundamental
until
our
beliefs
about
them
form
those
bodies
of
truth
known
as
logics
geometries
or
arithmetics
in
each
and
all
of
which
the
form
and
order
in
which
the
whole
is
cast
is
flagrantly
thus
to
say
nothing
of
the
new
facts
which
men
add
to
the
matter
of
reality
by
the
acts
of
their
own
lives
they
have
already
impressed
their
mental
forms
on
that
whole
third
of
reality
which
i
have
called
truths
every
hour
brings
its
new
percepts
its
own
facts
of
sensation
and
relation
to
be
truly
taken
account
of
but
the
whole
of
our
past
dealings
with
such
facts
is
already
funded
in
the
previous
truths
it
is
therefore
only
the
smallest
and
recentest
fraction
of
the
first
two
parts
of
reality
that
comes
to
us
without
the
human
touch
and
that
fraction
has
immediately
to
become
humanized
in
the
sense
of
being
squared
assimilated
or
in
some
way
adapted
to
the
humanized
mass
already
there
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
can
hardly
take
in
an
impression
at
all
in
the
absence
of
a
of
what
impressions
there
may
possibly
be
when
we
talk
of
reality
of
human
thinking
then
it
seems
a
thing
very
hard
to
find
it
reduces
to
the
notion
of
what
is
just
entering
into
experience
and
yet
to
be
named
or
else
to
some
imagined
aboriginal
presence
in
experience
before
any
belief
about
the
presence
had
arisen
before
any
human
conception
had
been
applied
it
is
what
is
absolutely
dumb
and
evanescent
the
merely
ideal
limit
of
our
minds
we
may
glimpse
it
but
we
never
grasp
it
what
we
grasp
is
always
some
substitute
for
it
which
previous
human
thinking
has
peptonized
and
cooked
for
our
consumption
if
so
vulgar
an
expression
were
allowed
us
we
might
say
that
wherever
we
find
it
it
has
been
already
faked
this
is
what
schiller
has
in
mind
when
he
calls
independent
reality
a
mere
unresisting
u
lambda
nu
which
is
only
to
be
made
over
by
us
that
is
schiller
belief
about
the
sensible
core
of
reality
we
it
in
bradley
words
but
do
possess
it
superficially
this
sounds
like
kant
view
but
between
categories
fulminated
before
nature
began
and
categories
gradually
forming
themselves
in
nature
presence
the
whole
chasm
between
rationalism
and
empiricism
yawns
to
the
genuine
schiller
will
always
be
to
kant
as
a
satyr
to
hyperion
other
pragmatists
may
reach
more
positive
beliefs
about
the
sensible
core
of
reality
they
may
think
to
get
at
it
in
its
independent
nature
by
peeling
off
the
successive
wrappings
they
may
make
theories
that
tell
us
where
it
comes
from
and
all
about
it
and
if
these
theories
work
satisfactorily
they
will
be
true
the
transcendental
idealists
say
there
is
no
core
the
finally
completed
wrapping
being
reality
and
truth
in
one
scholasticism
still
teaches
that
the
core
is
professor
bergson
heymans
strong
and
others
believe
in
the
core
and
bravely
try
to
define
it
dewey
and
schiller
treat
it
as
a
which
is
the
truer
of
all
these
diverse
accounts
or
of
others
comparable
with
them
unless
it
be
the
one
that
finally
proves
the
most
satisfactory
on
the
one
hand
there
will
stand
reality
on
the
other
an
account
of
it
which
proves
impossible
to
better
or
to
alter
if
the
impossibility
prove
permanent
the
truth
of
the
account
will
be
absolute
other
content
of
truth
than
this
i
can
find
nowhere
if
the
have
any
other
meaning
let
them
for
heaven
sake
reveal
it
let
them
grant
us
access
to
it
not
being
reality
but
only
our
belief
about
reality
it
will
contain
human
elements
but
these
will
know
the
element
in
the
only
sense
in
which
there
can
be
knowledge
of
anything
does
the
river
make
its
banks
or
do
the
banks
make
the
river
does
a
man
walk
with
his
right
leg
or
with
his
left
leg
more
essentially
just
as
impossible
may
it
be
to
separate
the
real
from
the
human
factors
in
the
growth
of
our
cognitive
experience
let
this
stand
as
a
first
brief
indication
of
the
humanistic
position
does
it
seem
paradoxical
if
so
i
will
try
to
make
it
plausible
by
a
few
illustrations
which
will
lead
to
a
fuller
acquaintance
with
the
subject
in
many
familiar
objects
everyone
will
recognize
the
human
element
we
conceive
a
given
reality
in
this
way
or
in
that
to
suit
our
purpose
and
the
reality
passively
submits
to
the
conception
you
can
take
the
number
as
the
cube
of
or
as
the
product
of
and
or
as
plus
or
minus
or
in
countless
other
ways
of
which
one
will
be
just
as
true
as
another
you
can
take
a
chessboard
as
black
squares
on
a
white
ground
or
as
white
squares
on
a
black
ground
and
neither
conception
is
a
false
one
you
can
treat
the
adjoined
figure
figure
of
a
of
david
as
a
star
as
two
big
triangles
crossing
each
other
as
a
hexagon
with
legs
set
up
on
its
angles
as
six
equal
triangles
hanging
together
by
their
tips
etc
all
these
treatments
are
true
treatments
the
sensible
that
upon
the
paper
resists
no
one
of
them
you
can
say
of
a
line
that
it
runs
east
or
you
can
say
that
it
runs
west
and
the
line
per
se
accepts
both
descriptions
without
rebelling
at
the
inconsistency
we
carve
out
groups
of
stars
in
the
heavens
and
call
them
constellations
and
the
stars
patiently
suffer
us
to
do
so
tho
if
they
knew
what
we
were
doing
some
of
them
might
feel
much
surprised
at
the
partners
we
had
given
them
we
name
the
same
constellation
diversely
as
charles
wain
the
great
bear
or
the
dipper
none
of
the
names
will
be
false
and
one
will
be
as
true
as
another
for
all
are
applicable
in
all
these
cases
we
humanly
make
an
addition
to
some
sensible
reality
and
that
reality
tolerates
the
addition
all
the
additions
with
the
reality
they
fit
it
while
they
build
it
out
no
one
of
them
is
false
which
may
be
treated
as
the
more
true
depends
altogether
on
the
human
use
of
it
if
the
is
a
number
of
dollars
which
i
find
in
a
drawer
where
i
had
left
it
is
minus
if
it
is
the
number
of
inches
in
a
shelf
which
i
wish
to
insert
into
a
cupboard
inches
wide
it
is
plus
if
i
wish
to
ennoble
the
heavens
by
the
constellations
i
see
there
wain
would
be
more
true
than
my
friend
frederick
myers
was
humorously
indignant
that
that
prodigious
should
remind
us
americans
of
nothing
but
a
culinary
utensil
what
shall
we
call
a
thing
anyhow
it
seems
quite
arbitrary
for
we
carve
out
everything
just
as
we
carve
out
constellations
to
suit
our
human
purposes
for
me
this
whole
is
one
thing
which
grows
now
restless
now
attentive
i
have
no
use
at
present
for
its
individual
units
so
i
do
consider
them
so
of
an
of
a
but
in
your
own
eyes
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
call
you
is
an
accidental
way
of
taking
you
the
permanently
real
things
for
you
are
your
individual
persons
to
an
anatomist
again
those
persons
are
but
organisms
and
the
real
things
are
the
organs
not
the
organs
so
much
as
their
constituent
cells
say
the
histologists
not
the
cells
but
their
molecules
say
in
turn
the
chemists
we
break
the
flux
of
sensible
reality
into
things
then
at
our
will
we
create
the
subjects
of
our
true
as
well
as
of
our
false
propositions
we
create
the
predicates
also
many
of
the
predicates
of
things
express
only
the
relations

you
see
how
naturally
one
comes
to
the
humanistic
principle
you
weed
out
the
human
contribution
our
nouns
and
adjectives
are
all
humanized
heirlooms
and
in
the
theories
we
build
them
into
the
inner
order

the
stubborn
fact
remains
that
there
is
a
sensible
flux
what
is
true
of
it
seems
from
first
to

to
be
largely
a
matter
of

own

we
build
the

out

does

may
be

the

themselves
important

die

is
a
phrase
used
by
professor
eucken
somewhere
which
reminds
one
of
this
suggestion
by
the
great
lotze
it
is
identically
our
pragmatistic
conception
in
our
cognitive
as
well
as
in
our
active
life
we
are
creative
we
add
both
to
the
subject
and
to
the
predicate
part
of
reality
the
world
stands
really
malleable
waiting
to
receive
its
final
touches
at
our
hands
like
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
suffers
human
violence
willingly
man
engenders
truths
upon
it
no
one
can
deny
that
such
a
role
would
add
both
to
our
dignity
and
to
our
responsibility
as
thinkers
to
some
of
us
it
proves
a
most
inspiring
notion
signer
papini
the
leader
of
italian
pragmatism
grows
fairly
dithyrambic
over
the
view
that
it
opens
of
man
functions
the
import
of
the
difference
between
pragmatism
and
rationalism
is
now
in
sight
throughout
its
whole
extent
the
essential
contrast
is
that
for
rationalism
reality
is
and
complete
from
all
eternity
while
for
pragmatism
it
is
still
in
the
making
and
awaits
part
of
its
complexion
from
the
future
on
the
one
side
the
universe
is
absolutely
secure
on
the
other
it
is
still
pursuing
its
adventures
we
have
got
into
rather
deep
water
with
this
humanistic
view
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
misunderstanding
gathers
round
it
it
is
accused
of
being
a
doctrine
of
caprice
bradley
for
example
says
that
a
humanist
if
he
understood
his
own
doctrine
would
have
to
hold
any
end
however
perverted
to
be
rational
if
i
insist
on
it
personally
and
any
idea
however
mad
to
be
the
truth
if
only
some
one
is
resolved
that
he
will
have
it
so
the
humanist
view
of
as
something
resisting
yet
malleable
which
controls
our
thinking
as
an
energy
that
must
be
taken
of
incessantly
tho
not
necessarily
merely
copied
is
evidently
a
difficult
one
to
introduce
to
novices
the
situation
reminds
me
of
one
that
i
have
personally
gone
through
i
once
wrote
an
essay
on
our
right
to
believe
which
i
unluckily
called
the
will
to
believe
all
the
critics
neglecting
the
essay
pounced
upon
the
title
psychologically
it
was
impossible
morally
it
was
iniquitous
the
will
to
deceive
the
will
to
were
wittily
proposed
as
substitutes
for
it
the
alternative
between
pragmatism
and
rationalism
in
the
shape
in
which
we
now
have
it
before
us
is
no
longer
a
question
in
the
theory
of
knowledge
it
concerns
the
structure
of
the
universe
itself
on
the
pragmatist
side
we
have
only
one
edition
of
the
universe
unfinished
growing
in
all
sorts
of
places
especially
in
the
places
where
thinking
beings
are
at
work
on
the
rationalist
side
we
have
a
universe
in
many
editions
one
real
one
the
infinite
folio
or
edition
de
luxe
eternally
complete
and
then
the
various
finite
editions
full
of
false
readings
distorted
and
mutilated
each
in
its
own
way
so
the
rival
metaphysical
hypotheses
of
pluralism
and
monism
here
come
back
upon
us
i
will
develope
their
differences
during
the
remainder
of
our
hour
and
first
let
me
say
that
it
is
impossible
not
to
see
a
temperamental
difference
at
work
in
the
choice
of
sides
the
rationalist
mind
radically
taken
is
of
a
doctrinaire
and
authoritative
complexion
the
phrase
be
is
ever
on
its
lips
the
of
its
universe
must
be
tight
a
radical
pragmatist
on
the
other
hand
is
a
anarchistic
sort
of
creature
if
he
had
to
live
in
a
tub
like
diogenes
he
would
mind
at
all
if
the
hoops
were
loose
and
the
staves
let
in
the
sun
now
the
idea
of
this
loose
universe
affects
your
typical
rationalists
in
much
the
same
way
as
of
the
press
might
affect
a
veteran
official
in
the
russian
bureau
of
censorship
or
as
spelling
might
affect
an
elderly
schoolmistress
it
affects
him
as
the
swarm
of
protestant
sects
affects
a
papist
onlooker
it
appears
as
backboneless
and
devoid
of
principle
as
in
politics
appears
to
an
french
legitimist
or
to
a
fanatical
believer
in
the
divine
right
of
the
people
for
pluralistic
pragmatism
truth
grows
up
inside
of
all
the
finite
experiences
they
lean
on
each
other
but
the
whole
of
them
if
such
a
whole
there
be
leans
on
nothing
all
are
in
finite
experience
finite
experience
as
such
is
homeless
nothing
outside
of
the
flux
secures
the
issue
of
it
it
can
hope
salvation
only
from
its
own
intrinsic
promises
and
potencies
to
rationalists
this
describes
a
tramp
and
vagrant
world
adrift
in
space
with
neither
elephant
nor
tortoise
to
plant
the
sole
of
its
foot
upon
it
is
a
set
of
stars
hurled
into
heaven
without
even
a
centre
of
gravity
to
pull
against
in
other
spheres
of
life
it
is
true
that
we
have
got
used
to
living
in
a
state
of
relative
insecurity
the
authority
of
state
and
that
of
an
absolute
law
have
resolved
themselves
into
expediencies
and
holy
church
has
resolved
itself
into
not
so
as
yet
within
the
philosophic
a
universe
with
such
as
us
contributing
to
create
its
truth
a
world
delivered
to
our
opportunisms
and
our
private
judgments
for
ireland
would
be
a
millennium
in
comparison
we
no
more
fit
for
such
a
part
than
the
filipinos
are
for
such
a
world
would
not
be
respectable
philosophically
it
is
a
trunk
without
a
tag
a
dog
without
a
collar
in
the
eyes
of
most
professors
of
philosophy
what
then
would
tighten
this
loose
universe
according
to
the
professors
something
to
support
the
finite
many
to
tie
it
to
to
unify
and
anchor
it
something
unexposed
to
accident
something
eternal
and
unalterable
the
mutable
in
experience
must
be
founded
on
immutability
behind
our
de
facto
world
our
world
in
act
there
must
be
a
de
jure
duplicate
fixed
and
previous
with
all
that
can
happen
here
already
there
in
posse
every
drop
of
blood
every
smallest
item
appointed
and
provided
stamped
and
branded
without
chance
of
variation
the
negatives
that
haunt
our
ideals
here
below
must
be
themselves
negated
in
the
absolutely
real
this
alone
makes
the
universe
solid
this
is
the
resting
deep
we
live
upon
the
stormy
surface
but
with
this
our
anchor
holds
for
it
grapples
rocky
bottom
this
is
wordsworth
central
peace
subsisting
at
the
heart
of
endless
agitation
this
is
vivekananda
mystical
one
of
which
i
read
to
you
this
is
reality
with
the
big
r
reality
that
makes
the
timeless
claim
reality
to
which
defeat
ca
happen
this
is
what
the
men
of
principles
and
in
general
all
the
men
whom
i
called
in
my
first
lecture
think
themselves
obliged
to
postulate
and
this
exactly
this
is
what
the
of
that
lecture
find
themselves
moved
to
call
a
piece
of
perverse
the
are
the
men
whose
alpha
and
omega
are
facts
behind
the
bare
phenomenal
facts
as
my
old
friend
chauncey
wright
the
great
harvard
empiricist
of
my
youth
used
to
say
there
is
nothing
when
a
rationalist
insists
that
behind
the
facts
there
is
the
ground
of
the
facts
the
possibility
of
the
facts
the
tougher
empiricists
accuse
him
of
taking
the
mere
name
and
nature
of
a
fact
and
clapping
it
behind
the
fact
as
a
duplicate
entity
to
make
it
possible
that
such
sham
grounds
are
often
invoked
is
notorious
at
a
surgical
operation
i
heard
a
bystander
ask
a
doctor
why
the
patient
breathed
so
deeply
because
ether
is
a
respiratory
stimulant
the
doctor
answered
ah
said
the
questioner
as
if
relieved
by
the
explanation
but
this
is
like
saying
that
cyanide
of
potassium
kills
because
it
is
a
or
that
it
is
so
cold
because
it
is
or
that
we
have
five
fingers
because
we
are
these
are
but
names
for
the
facts
taken
from
the
facts
and
then
treated
as
previous
and
explanatory
the
notion
of
an
absolute
reality
is
according
to
the
radically
framed
on
just
this
pattern
it
is
but
our
summarizing
name
for
the
whole
and
mass
of
phenomena
treated
as
if
it
were
a
different
entity
both
one
and
previous
you
see
how
differently
people
take
things
the
world
we
live
in
exists
diffused
and
distributed
in
the
form
of
an
indefinitely
numerous
lot
of
eaches
coherent
in
all
sorts
of
ways
and
degrees
and
the
are
perfectly
willing
to
keep
them
at
that
valuation
they
can
stand
that
kind
of
world
their
temper
being
well
adapted
to
its
insecurity
not
so
the
party
they
must
back
the
world
we
find
ourselves
born
into
by
another
and
a
better
world
in
which
the
eaches
form
an
all
and
the
all
a
one
that
logically
presupposes
and
secures
each
each
without
exception
must
we
as
pragmatists
be
radically
or
can
we
treat
the
absolute
edition
of
the
world
as
a
legitimate
hypothesis
it
is
certainly
legitimate
for
it
is
thinkable
whether
we
take
it
in
its
abstract
or
in
its
concrete
shape
by
taking
it
abstractly
i
mean
placing
it
behind
our
finite
life
as
we
place
the
word
behind
cold
weather
is
only
the
name
for
a
certain
number
of
days
which
we
find
generally
characterized
by
cold
weather
but
it
guarantees
nothing
in
that
line
for
our
thermometer
may
soar
into
the
nevertheless
the
word
is
a
useful
one
to
plunge
forward
with
into
the
stream
of
our
experience
it
cuts
off
certain
probabilities
and
sets
up
others
you
can
put
away
your
you
can
unpack
your
arctics
it
is
a
summary
of
things
to
look
for
it
names
a
part
of
nature
habits
and
gets
you
ready
for
their
continuation
it
is
a
definite
instrument
abstracted
from
experience
a
conceptual
reality
that
you
must
take
account
of
and
which
reflects
you
totally
back
into
sensible
realities
the
pragmatist
is
the
last
person
to
deny
the
reality
of
such
abstractions
they
are
so
much
past
experience
funded
but
taking
the
absolute
edition
of
the
world
concretely
means
a
different
hypothesis
rationalists
take
it
concretely
and
oppose
it
to
the
world
finite
editions
they
give
it
a
particular
nature
it
is
perfect
finished
everything
known
there
is
known
along
with
everything
else
here
where
ignorance
reigns
far
otherwise
if
there
is
want
there
there
also
is
the
satisfaction
provided
here
all
is
process
that
world
is
timeless
possibilities
obtain
in
our
world
in
the
absolute
world
where
all
that
is
not
is
from
eternity
impossible
and
all
that
is
is
necessary
the
category
of
possibility
has
no
application
in
this
world
crimes
and
horrors
are
regrettable
in
that
totalized
world
regret
obtains
not
for
the
existence
of
ill
in
the
temporal
order
is
the
very
condition
of
the
perfection
of
the
eternal
order
once
more
either
hypothesis
is
legitimate
in
pragmatist
eyes
for
either
has
its
uses
abstractly
or
taken
like
the
word
winter
as
a
memorandum
of
past
experience
that
orients
us
towards
the
future
the
notion
of
the
absolute
world
is
indispensable
concretely
taken
it
is
also
indispensable
at
least
to
certain
minds
for
it
determines
them
religiously
being
often
a
thing
to
change
their
lives
by
and
by
changing
their
lives
to
change
whatever
in
the
outer
order
depends
on
them
we
can
not
therefore
methodically
join
the
tough
minds
in
their
rejection
of
the
whole
notion
of
a
world
beyond
our
finite
experience
one
misunderstanding
of
pragmatism
is
to
identify
it
with
positivistic
to
suppose
that
it
scorns
every
rationalistic
notion
as
so
much
jabber
and
gesticulation
that
it
loves
intellectual
anarchy
as
such
and
prefers
a
sort
of
absolutely
unpent
and
wild
and
without
a
master
or
a
collar
to
any
philosophic
product
whatsoever
i
have
said
so
much
in
these
lectures
against
the
forms
of
rationalism
that
i
am
prepared
for
some
misunderstanding
here
but
i
confess
that
the
amount
of
it
that
i
have
found
in
this
very
audience
surprises
me
for
i
have
simultaneously
defended
rationalistic
hypotheses
so
far
as
these
you
fruitfully
into
experience
for
instance
i
receive
this
morning
this
question
on
a
is
a
pragmatist
necessarily
a
complete
materialist
and
agnostic
one
of
my
oldest
friends
who
ought
to
know
me
better
writes
me
a
letter
that
accuses
the
pragmatism
i
am
recommending
of
shutting
out
all
wider
metaphysical
views
and
condemning
us
to
the
most
naturalism
let
me
read
you
some
extracts
from
it
it
seems
to
me
my
friend
writes
that
the
pragmatic
objection
to
pragmatism
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
might
accentuate
the
narrowness
of
narrow
minds
your
call
to
the
rejection
of
the
and
the
is
of
course
inspiring
but
although
it
is
salutary
and
stimulating
to
be
told
that
one
should
be
responsible
for
the
immediate
issues
and
bearings
of
his
words
and
thoughts
i
decline
to
be
deprived
of
the
pleasure
and
profit
of
dwelling
also
on
remoter
bearings
and
issues
and
it
is
the
tendency
of
pragmatism
to
refuse
this
privilege
in
short
it
seems
to
me
that
the
limitations
or
rather
the
dangers
of
the
pragmatic
tendency
are
analogous
to
those
which
beset
the
unwary
followers
of
the
sciences
chemistry
and
physics
are
eminently
pragmatic
and
many
of
their
devotees
smugly
content
with
the
data
that
their
weights
and
measures
furnish
feel
an
infinite
pity
and
disdain
for
all
students
of
philosophy
and
whomsoever
and
of
course
everything
can
be
expressed
after
a
fashion
and
in
terms
of
chemistry
and
physics
that
is
everything
except
the
vital
principle
of
the
whole
and
that
they
say
there
is
no
pragmatic
use
in
trying
to
express
it
has
no
bearings
for
them
i
for
my
part
refuse
to
be
persuaded
that
we
can
not
look
beyond
the
obvious
pluralism
of
the
naturalist
and
the
pragmatist
to
a
logical
unity
in
which
they
take
no
interest
how
is
such
a
conception
of
the
pragmatism
i
am
advocating
possible
after
my
first
and
second
lectures
i
have
all
along
been
offering
it
expressly
as
a
mediator
between
and
if
the
notion
of
a
world
ante
rem
whether
taken
abstractly
like
the
word
winter
or
concretely
as
the
hypothesis
of
an
absolute
can
be
shown
to
have
any
consequences
whatever
for
our
life
it
has
a
meaning
if
the
meaning
works
it
will
have
some
truth
that
ought
to
be
held
to
through
all
possible
reformulations
for
pragmatism
the
absolutistic
hypothesis
that
perfection
is
eternal
aboriginal
and
most
real
has
a
perfectly
definite
meaning
and
it
works
religiously
to
examine
how
will
be
the
subject
of
my
next
and
final
lecture
lecture
viii
pragmatism
and
religion
at
the
close
of
the
last
lecture
i
reminded
you
of
the
first
one
in
which
i
had
opposed
to
and
recommended
pragmatism
as
their
mediator
positively
rejects
hypothesis
of
an
eternal
perfect
edition
of
the
universe
coexisting
with
our
finite
experience
on
pragmatic
principles
we
can
not
reject
any
hypothesis
if
consequences
useful
to
life
flow
from
it
universal
conceptions
as
things
to
take
account
of
may
be
as
real
for
pragmatism
as
particular
sensations
are
they
have
indeed
no
meaning
and
no
reality
if
they
have
no
use
but
if
they
have
any
use
they
have
that
amount
of
meaning
and
the
meaning
will
be
true
if
the
use
squares
well
with
life
other
uses
well
the
use
of
the
absolute
is
proved
by
the
whole
course
of
men
religious
history
the
eternal
arms
are
then
beneath
remember
vivekananda
use
of
the
atman
it
is
indeed
not
a
scientific
use
for
we
can
make
no
particular
deductions
from
it
it
is
emotional
and
spiritual
altogether
it
is
always
best
to
discuss
things
by
the
help
of
concrete
examples
let
me
read
therefore
some
of
those
verses
entitled
to
you
by
walt
whitman
you
of
course
meaning
the
reader
or
hearer
of
the
poem
whosoever
he
or
she
may
be
whoever
you
are
now
i
place
my
hand
upon
you
that
you
be
my
poem
i
whisper
with
my
lips
close
to
your
ear
i
have
loved
many
women
and
men
but
i
love
none
better
than
you
o
i
have
been
dilatory
and
dumb
i
should
have
made
my
way
straight
to
you
long
ago
i
should
have
blabb
nothing
but
you
i
should
have
chanted
nothing
but
you
i
will
leave
all
and
come
and
make
the
hymns
of
you
none
have
understood
you
but
i
understand
you
none
have
done
justice
to
you
you
have
not
done
justice
to
yourself
none
but
have
found
you
imperfect
i
only
find
no
imperfection
in
you
o
i
could
sing
such
grandeurs
and
glories
about
you
you
have
not
known
what
you
are
you
have
slumber
upon
yourself
all
your
life
what
you
have
done
returns
already
in
mockeries
but
the
mockeries
are
not
you
underneath
them
and
within
them
i
see
you
lurk
i
pursue
you
where
none
else
has
pursued
you
silence
the
desk
the
flippant
expression
the
night
the
accustom
routine
if
these
conceal
you
from
others
or
from
yourself
they
do
not
conceal
you
from
me
the
shaved
face
the
unsteady
eye
the
impure
complexion
if
these
balk
others
they
do
not
balk
me
the
pert
apparel
the
attitude
drunkenness
greed
premature
death
all
these
i
part
aside
there
is
no
endowment
in
man
or
woman
that
is
not
tallied
in
you
there
is
no
virtue
no
beauty
in
man
or
woman
but
as
good
is
in
you
no
pluck
no
endurance
in
others
but
as
good
is
in
you
no
pleasure
waiting
for
others
but
an
equal
pleasure
waits
for
you
whoever
you
are
claim
your
own
at
any
hazard
these
shows
of
the
east
and
west
are
tame
compared
to
you
these
immense
meadows
these
interminable
rivers
you
are
immense
and
interminable
as
they
you
are
he
or
she
who
is
master
or
mistress
over
them
master
or
mistress
in
your
own
right
over
nature
elements
pain
passion
dissolution
the
hopples
fall
from
your
ankles
you
find
an
unfailing
sufficiency
old
or
young
male
or
female
rude
low
rejected
by
the
rest
whatever
you
are
promulges
itself
through
birth
life
death
burial
the
means
are
provided
nothing
is
scanted
through
angers
losses
ambition
ignorance
ennui
what
you
are
picks
its
way
verily
a
fine
and
moving
poem
in
any
case
but
there
are
two
ways
of
taking
it
both
useful
one
is
the
monistic
way
the
mystical
way
of
pure
cosmic
emotion
the
glories
and
grandeurs
they
are
yours
absolutely
even
in
the
midst
of
your
defacements
whatever
may
happen
to
you
whatever
you
may
appear
to
be
inwardly
you
are
safe
look
back
lie
back
on
your
true
principle
of
being
this
is
the
famous
way
of
quietism
of
indifferentism
its
enemies
compare
it
to
a
spiritual
opium
yet
pragmatism
must
respect
this
way
for
it
has
massive
historic
vindication
but
pragmatism
sees
another
way
to
be
respected
also
the
pluralistic
way
of
interpreting
the
poem
the
you
so
glorified
to
which
the
hymn
is
sung
may
mean
your
better
possibilities
phenomenally
taken
or
the
specific
redemptive
effects
even
of
your
failures
upon
yourself
or
others
it
may
mean
your
loyalty
to
the
possibilities
of
others
whom
you
admire
and
love
so
that
you
are
willing
to
accept
your
own
poor
life
for
it
is
that
glory
partner
you
can
at
least
appreciate
applaud
furnish
the
audience
of
so
brave
a
total
world
forget
the
low
in
yourself
then
think
only
of
the
high
identify
your
life
therewith
then
through
angers
losses
ignorance
ennui
whatever
you
thus
make
yourself
whatever
you
thus
most
deeply
are
picks
its
way
in
either
way
of
taking
the
poem
it
encourages
fidelity
to
ourselves
both
ways
satisfy
both
sanctify
the
human
flux
both
paint
the
portrait
of
the
you
on
a
but
the
background
of
the
first
way
is
the
static
one
while
in
the
second
way
it
means
possibles
in
the
plural
genuine
possibles
and
it
has
all
the
restlessness
of
that
conception
noble
enough
is
either
way
of
reading
the
poem
but
plainly
the
pluralistic
way
agrees
with
the
pragmatic
temper
best
for
it
immediately
suggests
an
infinitely
larger
number
of
the
details
of
future
experience
to
our
mind
it
sets
definite
activities
in
us
at
work
altho
this
second
way
seems
prosaic
and
earthborn
in
comparison
with
the
first
way
yet
no
one
can
accuse
it
of
in
any
brutal
sense
of
the
term
yet
if
as
pragmatists
you
should
positively
set
up
the
second
way
against
the
first
way
you
would
very
likely
be
misunderstood
you
would
be
accused
of
denying
nobler
conceptions
and
of
being
an
ally
of
in
the
worst
sense
you
remember
the
letter
from
a
member
of
this
audience
from
which
i
read
some
extracts
at
our
previous
meeting
let
me
read
you
an
additional
extract
now
it
shows
a
vagueness
in
realizing
the
alternatives
before
us
which
i
think
is
very
widespread
i
believe
writes
my
friend
and
correspondent
in
pluralism
i
believe
that
in
our
search
for
truth
we
leap
from
one
floating
cake
of
ice
to
another
on
an
infinite
sea
and
that
by
each
of
our
acts
we
make
new
truths
possible
and
old
ones
impossible
i
believe
that
each
man
is
responsible
for
making
the
universe
better
and
that
if
he
does
not
do
this
it
will
be
in
so
far
left
undone
yet
at
the
same
time
i
am
willing
to
endure
that
my
children
should
be
incurably
sick
and
suffering
as
they
are
not
and
i
myself
stupid
and
yet
with
brains
enough
to
see
my
stupidity
only
on
one
condition
namely
that
through
the
construction
in
imagination
and
by
reasoning
of
a
rational
unity
of
all
things
i
can
conceive
my
acts
and
my
thoughts
and
my
troubles
as
supplemented
by
all
the
other
phenomena
of
the
world
and
as
forming
when
thus
supplemented
a
scheme
which
i
approve
and
adopt
as
my
i
own
and
for
my
part
i
refuse
to
be
persuaded
that
we
can
not
look
beyond
the
obvious
pluralism
of
the
naturalist
and
pragmatist
to
a
logical
unity
in
which
they
take
no
interest
or
stock
such
a
fine
expression
of
personal
faith
warms
the
heart
of
the
hearer
but
how
much
does
it
clear
his
philosophic
head
does
the
writer
consistently
favor
the
monistic
or
the
pluralistic
interpretation
of
the
world
poem
his
troubles
become
atoned
for
when
thus
supplemented
he
says
supplemented
that
is
by
all
the
remedies
that
the
other
phenomena
may
supply
obviously
here
the
writer
faces
forward
into
the
particulars
of
experience
which
he
interprets
in
a
way
but
he
believes
himself
to
face
backward
he
speaks
of
what
he
calls
the
rational
unity
of
things
when
all
the
while
he
really
means
their
possible
empirical
unification
he
supposes
at
the
same
time
that
the
pragmatist
because
he
criticizes
rationalism
abstract
one
is
cut
off
from
the
consolation
of
believing
in
the
saving
possibilities
of
the
concrete
many
he
fails
in
short
to
distinguish
between
taking
the
world
perfection
as
a
necessary
principle
and
taking
it
only
as
a
possible
terminus
ad
quem
i
regard
the
writer
of
this
letter
as
a
genuine
pragmatist
but
as
a
pragmatist
sans
le
savoir
he
appears
to
me
as
one
of
that
numerous
class
of
philosophic
amateurs
whom
i
spoke
of
in
my
first
lecture
as
wishing
to
have
all
the
good
things
going
without
being
too
careful
as
to
how
they
agree
or
disagree
rational
unity
of
all
things
is
so
inspiring
a
formula
that
he
brandishes
it
offhand
and
abstractly
accuses
pluralism
of
conflicting
with
it
for
the
bare
names
do
conflict
altho
concretely
he
means
by
it
just
the
pragmatistically
unified
and
ameliorated
world
most
of
us
remain
in
this
essential
vagueness
and
it
is
well
that
we
should
but
in
the
interest
of
it
is
well
that
some
of
us
should
go
farther
so
i
will
try
now
to
focus
a
little
more
discriminatingly
on
this
particular
religious
point
is
then
this
you
of
yous
this
absolutely
real
world
this
unity
that
yields
the
moral
inspiration
and
has
the
religious
value
to
be
taken
monistically
or
pluralistically
is
it
ante
rem
or
in
rebus
is
it
a
principle
or
an
end
an
absolute
or
an
ultimate
a
first
or
a
last
does
it
make
you
look
forward
or
lie
back
it
is
certainly
worth
while
not
to
clump
the
two
things
together
for
if
discriminated
they
have
decidedly
diverse
meanings
for
life
please
observe
that
the
whole
dilemma
revolves
pragmatically
about
the
notion
of
the
world
possibilities
intellectually
rationalism
invokes
its
absolute
principle
of
unity
as
a
ground
of
possibility
for
the
many
facts
emotionally
it
sees
it
as
a
container
and
limiter
of
possibilities
a
guarantee
that
the
upshot
shall
be
good
taken
in
this
way
the
absolute
makes
all
good
things
certain
and
all
bad
things
impossible
in
the
eternal
namely
and
may
be
said
to
transmute
the
entire
category
of
possibility
into
categories
more
secure
one
sees
at
this
point
that
the
great
religious
difference
lies
between
the
men
who
insist
that
the
world
must
and
shall
be
and
those
who
are
contented
with
believing
that
the
world
may
be
saved
the
whole
clash
of
rationalistic
and
empiricist
religion
is
thus
over
the
validity
of
possibility
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
begin
by
focusing
upon
that
word
what
may
the
word
definitely
mean
to
unreflecting
men
the
possible
means
a
sort
of
third
estate
of
being
less
real
than
existence
more
real
than
a
twilight
realm
a
hybrid
status
a
limbo
into
which
and
out
of
which
realities
ever
and
anon
are
made
to
pass
such
a
conception
is
of
course
too
vague
and
nondescript
to
satisfy
us
here
as
elsewhere
the
only
way
to
extract
a
term
meaning
is
to
use
the
pragmatic
method
on
it
when
you
say
that
a
thing
is
possible
what
difference
does
it
make
it
makes
at
least
this
difference
that
if
anyone
calls
it
impossible
you
can
contradict
him
if
anyone
calls
it
actual
you
can
contradict
him
and
if
anyone
calls
it
necessary
you
can
contradict
him
too
but
these
privileges
of
contradiction
do
amount
to
much
when
you
say
a
thing
is
possible
does
not
that
make
some
farther
difference
in
terms
of
actual
fact
it
makes
at
least
this
negative
difference
that
if
the
statement
be
true
it
follows
that
there
is
nothing
extant
capable
of
preventing
the
possible
thing
the
absence
of
real
grounds
of
interference
may
thus
be
said
to
make
things
not
impossible
possible
therefore
in
the
bare
or
abstract
sense
but
most
possibles
are
not
bare
they
are
concretely
grounded
or
as
we
say
what
does
this
mean
pragmatically
it
means
not
only
that
there
are
no
preventive
conditions
present
but
that
some
of
the
conditions
of
production
of
the
possible
thing
actually
are
here
thus
a
concretely
possible
chicken
means
that
the
idea
of
chicken
contains
no
essential
that
no
boys
skunks
or
other
enemies
are
about
and
that
at
least
an
actual
egg
exists
possible
chicken
means
actual
egg
plus
actual
sitting
hen
or
incubator
or
what
not
as
the
actual
conditions
approach
completeness
the
chicken
becomes
a
possibility
when
the
conditions
are
entirely
complete
it
ceases
to
be
a
possibility
and
turns
into
an
actual
fact
let
us
apply
this
notion
to
the
salvation
of
the
world
what
does
it
pragmatically
mean
to
say
that
this
is
possible
it
means
that
some
of
the
conditions
of
the
world
deliverance
do
actually
exist
the
more
of
them
there
are
existent
the
fewer
preventing
conditions
you
can
find
the
is
the
salvation
possibility
the
more
probable
does
the
fact
of
the
deliverance
become
so
much
for
our
preliminary
look
at
possibility
now
it
would
contradict
the
very
spirit
of
life
to
say
that
our
minds
must
be
indifferent
and
neutral
in
questions
like
that
of
the
salvation
anyone
who
pretends
to
be
neutral
writes
himself
down
here
as
a
fool
and
a
sham
we
all
do
wish
to
minimize
the
insecurity
of
the
universe
we
are
and
ought
to
be
unhappy
when
we
regard
it
as
exposed
to
every
enemy
and
open
to
every
draft
nevertheless
there
are
unhappy
men
who
think
the
salvation
of
the
world
impossible
theirs
is
the
doctrine
known
as
pessimism
optimism
in
turn
would
be
the
doctrine
that
thinks
the
world
salvation
inevitable
midway
between
the
two
there
stands
what
may
be
called
the
doctrine
of
meliorism
tho
it
has
hitherto
figured
less
as
a
doctrine
than
as
an
attitude
in
human
affairs
optimism
has
always
been
the
regnant
doctrine
in
european
philosophy
pessimism
was
only
recently
introduced
by
schopenhauer
and
counts
few
systematic
defenders
as
yet
meliorism
treats
salvation
as
neither
inevitable
nor
impossible
it
treats
it
as
a
possibility
which
becomes
more
and
more
of
a
probability
the
more
numerous
the
actual
conditions
of
salvation
become
it
is
clear
that
pragmatism
must
incline
towards
meliorism
some
conditions
of
the
world
salvation
are
actually
extant
and
she
can
not
possibly
close
her
eyes
to
this
fact
and
should
the
residual
conditions
come
salvation
would
become
an
accomplished
reality
naturally
the
terms
i
use
here
are
exceedingly
summary
you
may
interpret
the
word
in
any
way
you
like
and
make
it
as
diffuse
and
distributive
or
as
climacteric
and
integral
a
phenomenon
as
you
please
take
for
example
any
one
of
us
in
this
room
with
the
ideals
which
he
cherishes
and
is
willing
to
live
and
work
for
every
such
ideal
realized
will
be
one
moment
in
the
world
salvation
but
these
particular
ideals
are
not
bare
abstract
possibilities
they
are
grounded
they
are
live
possibilities
for
we
are
their
live
champions
and
pledges
and
if
the
complementary
conditions
come
and
add
themselves
our
ideals
will
become
actual
things
what
now
are
the
complementary
conditions
they
are
first
such
a
mixture
of
things
as
will
in
the
fulness
of
time
give
us
a
chance
a
gap
that
we
can
spring
into
and
finally
our
act
does
our
act
then
create
the
world
salvation
so
far
as
it
makes
room
for
itself
so
far
as
it
leaps
into
the
gap
does
it
create
not
the
whole
world
salvation
of
course
but
just
so
much
of
this
as
itself
covers
of
the
world
extent
here
i
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
in
spite
of
the
whole
crew
of
rationalists
and
monists
of
whatever
brand
they
be
i
ask
why
not
our
acts
our
where
we
seem
to
ourselves
to
make
ourselves
and
grow
are
the
parts
of
the
world
to
which
we
are
closest
the
parts
of
which
our
knowledge
is
the
most
intimate
and
complete
why
should
we
not
take
them
at
their
why
may
they
not
be
the
actual
and
which
they
seem
to
be
of
the
world
why
not
the
workshop
of
being
where
we
catch
fact
in
the
making
so
that
nowhere
may
the
world
grow
in
any
other
kind
of
way
than
this
irrational
we
are
told
how
can
new
being
come
in
local
spots
and
patches
which
add
themselves
or
stay
away
at
random
independently
of
the
rest
there
must
be
a
reason
for
our
acts
and
where
in
the
last
resort
can
any
reason
be
looked
for
save
in
the
material
pressure
or
the
logical
compulsion
of
the
total
nature
of
the
world
there
can
be
but
one
real
agent
of
growth
or
seeming
growth
anywhere
and
that
agent
is
the
integral
world
itself
it
may
grow
if
growth
there
be
but
that
single
parts
should
grow
per
se
is
irrational
but
if
one
talks
of
rationality
and
of
reasons
for
things
and
insists
that
they
ca
just
come
in
spots
what
kind
of
a
reason
can
there
ultimately
be
why
anything
should
come
at
all
talk
of
logic
and
necessity
and
categories
and
the
absolute
and
the
contents
of
the
whole
philosophical
as
you
will
the
only
real
reason
i
can
think
of
why
anything
should
ever
come
is
that
someone
wishes
it
to
be
here
it
is
demanded
demanded
it
may
be
to
give
relief
to
no
matter
how
small
a
fraction
of
the
world
mass
this
is
living
reason
and
compared
with
it
material
causes
and
logical
necessities
are
spectral
things
in
short
the
only
fully
rational
world
would
be
the
world
of
the
world
of
telepathy
where
every
desire
is
fulfilled
instanter
without
having
to
consider
or
placate
surrounding
or
intermediate
powers
this
is
the
absolute
own
world
he
calls
upon
the
phenomenal
world
to
be
and
it
is
exactly
as
he
calls
for
it
no
other
condition
being
required
in
our
world
the
wishes
of
the
individual
are
only
one
condition
other
individuals
are
there
with
other
wishes
and
they
must
be
propitiated
first
so
being
grows
under
all
sorts
of
resistances
in
this
world
of
the
many
and
from
compromise
to
compromise
only
gets
organized
gradually
into
what
may
be
called
secondarily
rational
shape
we
approach
the
type
of
organization
only
in
a
few
departments
of
life
we
want
water
and
we
turn
a
faucet
we
want
a
and
we
press
a
button
we
want
information
and
we
telephone
we
want
to
travel
and
we
buy
a
ticket
in
these
and
similar
cases
we
hardly
need
to
do
more
than
the
wishing
the
world
is
rationally
organized
to
do
the
rest
but
this
talk
of
rationality
is
a
parenthesis
and
a
digression
what
we
were
discussing
was
the
idea
of
a
world
growing
not
integrally
but
piecemeal
by
the
contributions
of
its
several
parts
take
the
hypothesis
seriously
and
as
a
live
one
suppose
that
the
world
author
put
the
case
to
you
before
creation
saying
i
am
going
to
make
a
world
not
certain
to
be
saved
a
world
the
perfection
of
which
shall
be
conditional
merely
the
condition
being
that
each
several
agent
does
its
own
best
i
offer
you
the
chance
of
taking
part
in
such
a
world
its
safety
you
see
is
unwarranted
it
is
a
real
adventure
with
real
danger
yet
it
may
win
through
it
is
a
social
scheme
of
work
genuinely
to
be
done
will
you
join
the
procession
will
you
trust
yourself
and
trust
the
other
agents
enough
to
face
the
risk
should
you
in
all
seriousness
if
participation
in
such
a
world
were
proposed
to
you
feel
bound
to
reject
it
as
not
safe
enough
would
you
say
that
rather
than
be
part
and
parcel
of
so
fundamentally
pluralistic
and
irrational
a
universe
you
preferred
to
relapse
into
the
slumber
of
nonentity
from
which
you
had
been
momentarily
aroused
by
the
voice
of
course
if
you
are
normally
constituted
you
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
there
is
a
buoyancy
in
most
of
us
which
such
a
universe
would
exactly
fit
we
would
therefore
accept
the
offer
top
und
schlag
auf
schlag
it
would
be
just
like
the
world
we
practically
live
in
and
loyalty
to
our
old
nurse
nature
would
forbid
us
to
say
no
the
world
proposed
would
seem
to
us
in
the
most
living
way
most
of
us
i
say
would
therefore
welcome
the
proposition
and
add
our
fiat
to
the
fiat
of
the
creator
yet
perhaps
some
would
not
for
there
are
morbid
minds
in
every
human
collection
and
to
them
the
prospect
of
a
universe
with
only
a
fighting
chance
of
safety
would
probably
make
no
appeal
there
are
moments
of
discouragement
in
us
all
when
we
are
sick
of
self
and
tired
of
vainly
striving
our
own
life
breaks
down
and
we
fall
into
the
attitude
of
the
prodigal
son
we
mistrust
the
chances
of
things
we
want
a
universe
where
we
can
just
give
up
fall
on
our
father
neck
and
be
absorbed
into
the
absolute
life
as
a
drop
of
water
melts
into
the
river
or
the
sea
the
peace
and
rest
the
security
desiderated
at
such
moments
is
security
against
the
bewildering
accidents
of
so
much
finite
experience
nirvana
means
safety
from
this
everlasting
round
of
adventures
of
which
the
world
of
sense
consists
the
hindoo
and
the
buddhist
for
this
is
essentially
their
attitude
are
simply
afraid
afraid
of
more
experience
afraid
of
life
and
to
men
of
this
complexion
religious
monism
comes
with
its
consoling
words
all
is
needed
and
essential
even
you
with
your
sick
soul
and
heart
all
are
one
with
god
and
with
god
all
is
well
the
everlasting
arms
are
beneath
whether
in
the
world
of
finite
appearances
you
seem
to
fail
or
to
succeed
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
when
men
are
reduced
to
their
last
sick
extremity
absolutism
is
the
only
saving
scheme
pluralistic
moralism
simply
makes
their
teeth
chatter
it
refrigerates
the
very
heart
within
their
breast
so
we
see
concretely
two
types
of
religion
in
sharp
contrast
using
our
old
terms
of
comparison
we
may
say
that
the
absolutistic
scheme
appeals
to
the
while
the
pluralistic
scheme
appeals
to
the
tough
many
persons
would
refuse
to
call
the
pluralistic
scheme
religious
at
all
they
would
call
it
moralistic
and
would
apply
the
word
religious
to
the
monistic
scheme
alone
religion
in
the
sense
of
and
moralism
in
the
sense
of
have
been
pitted
against
each
other
as
incompatibles
frequently
enough
in
the
history
of
human
thought
we
stand
here
before
the
final
question
of
philosophy
i
said
in
my
fourth
lecture
that
i
believed
the
alternative
to
be
the
deepest
and
most
pregnant
question
that
our
minds
can
frame
can
it
be
that
the
disjunction
is
a
final
one
that
only
one
side
can
be
true
are
a
pluralism
and
monism
genuine
incompatibles
so
that
if
the
world
were
really
pluralistically
constituted
if
it
really
existed
distributively
and
were
made
up
of
a
lot
of
eaches
it
could
only
be
saved
piecemeal
and
de
facto
as
the
result
of
their
behavior
and
its
epic
history
in
no
wise
by
some
essential
oneness
in
which
the
severalness
were
already
up
beforehand
and
eternally
if
this
were
so
we
should
have
to
choose
one
philosophy
or
the
other
we
could
not
say
yes
to
both
alternatives
there
would
have
to
be
a
in
our
relations
with
the
possible
we
should
confess
an
ultimate
disappointment
we
could
not
remain
and
in
one
indivisible
act
of
course
as
human
beings
we
can
be
healthy
minds
on
one
day
and
sick
souls
on
the
next
and
as
amateur
dabblers
in
philosophy
we
may
perhaps
be
allowed
to
call
ourselves
monistic
pluralists
or
determinists
or
whatever
else
may
occur
to
us
of
a
reconciling
kind
but
as
philosophers
aiming
at
clearness
and
consistency
and
feeling
the
pragmatistic
need
of
squaring
truth
with
truth
the
question
is
forced
upon
us
of
frankly
adopting
either
the
tender
or
the
robustious
type
of
thought
in
particular
this
query
has
always
come
home
to
me
may
not
the
claims
of
go
too
far
may
not
the
notion
of
a
world
already
saved
in
toto
anyhow
be
too
saccharine
to
stand
may
not
religious
optimism
be
too
idyllic
must
all
be
saved
is
no
price
to
be
paid
in
the
work
of
salvation
is
the
last
word
sweet
is
all
yes
in
the
universe
does
the
fact
of
stand
at
the
very
core
of
life
does
the
very
that
we
attribute
to
life
mean
that
ineluctable
noes
and
losses
form
a
part
of
it
that
there
are
genuine
sacrifices
somewhere
and
that
something
permanently
drastic
and
bitter
always
remains
at
the
bottom
of
its
cup
i
can
not
speak
officially
as
a
pragmatist
here
all
i
can
say
is
that
my
own
pragmatism
offers
no
objection
to
my
taking
sides
with
this
more
moralistic
view
and
giving
up
the
claim
of
total
reconciliation
the
possibility
of
this
is
involved
in
the
pragmatistic
willingness
to
treat
pluralism
as
a
serious
hypothesis
in
the
end
it
is
our
faith
and
not
our
logic
that
decides
such
questions
and
i
deny
the
right
of
any
pretended
logic
to
veto
my
own
faith
i
find
myself
willing
to
take
the
universe
to
be
really
dangerous
and
adventurous
without
therefore
backing
out
and
crying
play
i
am
willing
to
think
that
the
attitude
open
to
us
as
it
is
in
many
vicissitudes
is
not
the
right
and
final
attitude
towards
the
whole
of
life
i
am
willing
that
there
should
be
real
losses
and
real
losers
and
no
total
preservation
of
all
that
is
i
can
believe
in
the
ideal
as
an
ultimate
not
as
an
origin
and
as
an
extract
not
the
whole
when
the
cup
is
poured
off
the
dregs
are
left
behind
forever
but
the
possibility
of
what
is
poured
off
is
sweet
enough
to
accept
as
a
matter
of
fact
countless
human
imaginations
live
in
this
moralistic
and
epic
kind
of
a
universe
and
find
its
disseminated
and
successes
sufficient
for
their
rational
needs
there
is
a
finely
translated
epigram
in
the
greek
anthology
which
admirably
expresses
this
state
of
mind
this
acceptance
of
loss
as
unatoned
for
even
tho
the
lost
element
might
be
one
self
a
shipwrecked
sailor
buried
on
this
coast
bids
you
set
sail
full
many
a
gallant
bark
when
we
were
lost
weathered
the
gale
those
puritans
who
answered
to
the
question
are
you
willing
to
be
damned
for
god
glory
were
in
this
objective
and
magnanimous
condition
of
mind
the
way
of
escape
from
evil
on
this
system
is
not
by
getting
it
or
preserved
in
the
whole
as
an
element
essential
but
it
is
by
dropping
it
out
altogether
throwing
it
overboard
and
getting
beyond
it
helping
to
make
a
universe
that
shall
forget
its
very
place
and
name
it
is
then
perfectly
possible
to
accept
sincerely
a
drastic
kind
of
a
universe
from
which
the
element
of
is
not
to
be
expelled
whoso
does
so
is
it
seems
to
me
a
genuine
pragmatist
he
is
willing
to
live
on
a
scheme
of
uncertified
possibilities
which
he
trusts
willing
to
pay
with
his
own
person
if
need
be
for
the
realization
of
the
ideals
which
he
frames
what
now
actually
are
the
other
forces
which
he
trusts
to
with
him
in
a
universe
of
such
a
type
they
are
at
least
his
fellow
men
in
the
stage
of
being
which
our
actual
universe
has
reached
but
are
there
not
superhuman
forces
also
such
as
religious
men
of
the
pluralistic
type
we
have
been
considering
have
always
believed
in
their
words
may
have
sounded
monistic
when
they
said
there
is
no
god
but
god
but
the
original
polytheism
of
mankind
has
only
imperfectly
and
vaguely
sublimated
itself
into
monotheism
and
monotheism
itself
so
far
as
it
was
religious
and
not
a
scheme
of
instruction
for
the
metaphysicians
has
always
viewed
god
as
but
one
helper
primus
inter
pares
in
the
midst
of
all
the
shapers
of
the
great
world
fate
i
fear
that
my
previous
lectures
confined
as
they
have
been
to
human
and
humanistic
aspects
may
have
left
the
impression
on
many
of
you
that
pragmatism
means
methodically
to
leave
the
superhuman
out
i
have
shown
small
respect
indeed
for
the
absolute
and
i
have
until
this
moment
spoken
of
no
other
superhuman
hypothesis
but
that
but
i
trust
that
you
see
sufficiently
that
the
absolute
has
nothing
but
its
superhumanness
in
common
with
the
theistic
god
on
pragmatistic
principles
if
the
hypothesis
of
god
works
satisfactorily
in
the
widest
sense
of
the
word
it
is
true
now
whatever
its
residual
difficulties
may
be
experience
shows
that
it
certainly
does
work
and
that
the
problem
is
to
build
it
out
and
determine
it
so
that
it
will
combine
satisfactorily
with
all
the
other
working
truths
i
can
not
start
upon
a
whole
theology
at
the
end
of
this
last
lecture
but
when
i
tell
you
that
i
have
written
a
book
on
men
religious
experience
which
on
the
whole
has
been
regarded
as
making
for
the
reality
of
god
you
will
perhaps
exempt
my
own
pragmatism
from
the
charge
of
being
an
atheistic
system
i
firmly
disbelieve
myself
that
our
human
experience
is
the
highest
form
of
experience
extant
in
the
universe
i
believe
rather
that
we
stand
in
much
the
same
relation
to
the
whole
of
the
universe
as
our
canine
and
feline
pets
do
to
the
whole
of
human
life
they
inhabit
our
and
libraries
they
take
part
in
scenes
of
whose
significance
they
have
no
inkling
they
are
merely
tangent
to
curves
of
history
the
beginnings
and
ends
and
forms
of
which
pass
wholly
beyond
their
ken
so
we
are
tangents
to
the
wider
life
of
things
but
just
as
many
of
the
dog
and
ideals
coincide
with
our
ideals
and
the
dogs
and
cats
have
daily
living
proof
of
the
fact
so
we
may
well
believe
on
the
proofs
that
religious
experience
affords
that
higher
powers
exist
and
are
at
work
to
save
the
world
on
ideal
lines
similar
to
our
own
you
see
that
pragmatism
can
be
called
religious
if
you
allow
that
religion
can
be
pluralistic
or
merely
melioristic
in
type
but
whether
you
will
finally
put
up
with
that
type
of
religion
or
not
is
a
question
that
only
you
yourself
can
decide
pragmatism
has
to
postpone
dogmatic
answer
for
we
do
not
yet
know
certainly
which
type
of
religion
is
going
to
work
best
in
the
long
run
the
various
overbeliefs
of
men
their
several
are
in
fact
what
are
needed
to
bring
the
evidence
in
you
will
probably
make
your
own
ventures
severally
if
radically
tough
the
of
the
sensible
facts
of
nature
will
be
enough
for
you
and
you
will
need
no
religion
at
all
if
radically
tender
you
will
take
up
with
the
more
monistic
form
of
religion
the
pluralistic
form
with
its
reliance
on
possibilities
that
are
not
necessities
will
not
seem
to
afford
you
security
enough
but
if
you
are
neither
tough
nor
tender
in
an
extreme
and
radical
sense
but
mixed
as
most
of
us
are
it
may
seem
to
you
that
the
type
of
pluralistic
and
moralistic
religion
that
i
have
offered
