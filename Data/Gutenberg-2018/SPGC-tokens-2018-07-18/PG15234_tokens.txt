once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
called
ribby
who
invited
a
little
dog
called
duchess
to
tea
come
in
good
time
my
dear
duchess
said
ribby
letter
and
we
will
have
something
so
very
nice
i
am
baking
it
in
a
a
with
a
pink
rim
you
never
tasted
anything
so
good
and
shall
eat
it
all
will
eat
muffins
my
dear
duchess
wrote
ribby
duchess
read
the
letter
and
wrote
an
answer
i
will
come
with
much
pleasure
at
a
quarter
past
four
but
it
is
very
strange
was
just
going
to
invite
you
to
come
here
to
supper
my
dear
ribby
to
eat
something
i
will
come
very
punctually
my
dear
ribby
wrote
duchess
and
then
at
the
end
she
added
i
hope
it
is
mouse
illustration
the
invitation
and
then
she
thought
that
did
not
look
quite
polite
so
she
scratched
out
is
mouse
and
changed
it
to
i
hope
it
will
be
fine
and
she
gave
her
letter
to
the
postman
but
she
thought
a
great
deal
about
ribby
pie
and
she
read
letter
over
and
over
again
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
it
be
mouse
said
duchess
to
herself
i
really
could
eat
mouse
pie
and
i
shall
have
to
eat
it
because
it
is
a
party
and
pie
was
going
to
be
veal
and
ham
a
pink
and
white
and
so
is
mine
just
like
dishes
they
were
both
bought
at
tabitha
twitchit
duchess
went
into
her
larder
and
took
the
pie
off
a
shelf
and
looked
at
it
illustration
it
is
all
ready
to
put
into
the
oven
such
lovely
and
i
put
in
a
little
tin
to
hold
up
the
crust
and
i
made
a
hole
in
the
middle
with
a
fork
to
let
out
the
steam
oh
i
do
wish
i
could
eat
my
own
pie
instead
of
a
pie
made
of
mouse
duchess
considered
and
considered
and
read
ribby
letter
again
a
pink
and
white
and
shall
eat
it
means
me
then
ribby
is
not
going
to
even
taste
the
pie
herself
a
pink
and
white
ribby
is
sure
to
go
out
to
buy
the
muffins
oh
what
a
good
idea
why
should
i
rush
along
and
put
my
pie
into
oven
when
ribby
is
there
illustration
duchess
was
quite
delighted
with
her
own
cleverness
ribby
in
the
meantime
had
received
duchess
answer
and
as
soon
as
she
was
sure
that
the
little
dog
could
come
she
popped
pie
into
the
oven
there
were
two
ovens
one
above
the
other
some
other
knobs
and
handles
were
only
ornamental
and
not
intended
to
open
ribby
put
the
pie
into
the
lower
oven
the
door
was
very
stiff
the
top
oven
bakes
too
quickly
said
ribby
to
herself
it
is
a
pie
of
the
most
delicate
and
tender
mouse
minced
up
with
bacon
and
i
have
taken
out
all
the
bones
because
duchess
did
nearly
choke
herself
with
a
last
time
i
gave
a
party
she
eats
a
little
fast
rather
big
mouthfuls
but
a
most
genteel
and
elegant
little
dog
infinitely
superior
company
to
cousin
tabitha
twitchit
illustration
the
pie
made
of
mouse
ribby
put
on
some
coal
and
swept
up
the
hearth
then
she
went
out
with
a
can
to
the
well
for
water
to
fill
up
the
kettle
then
she
began
to
set
the
room
in
order
for
it
was
the
as
well
as
the
kitchen
she
shook
the
mats
out
at
the
and
put
them
straight
the
hearthrug
was
a
she
dusted
the
clock
and
the
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
and
she
polished
and
rubbed
the
tables
and
chairs
then
she
spread
a
very
clean
white
and
set
out
her
best
china
which
she
took
out
of
a
near
the
fireplace
the
were
white
with
a
pattern
of
pink
roses
and
the
were
white
and
blue
illustration
when
ribby
had
laid
the
table
she
took
a
jug
and
a
blue
and
white
dish
and
went
out
down
the
field
to
the
farm
to
fetch
milk
and
butter
when
she
came
back
she
peeped
into
the
bottom
oven
the
pie
looked
very
comfortable
ribby
put
on
her
shawl
and
bonnet
and
went
out
again
with
a
basket
to
the
village
shop
to
buy
a
packet
of
tea
a
pound
of
lump
sugar
and
a
pot
of
marmalade
and
just
at
the
same
time
duchess
came
out
of
house
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
illustration
the
veal
and
ham
pie
ribby
met
duchess
down
the
street
also
carrying
a
basket
covered
with
a
cloth
they
only
bowed
to
one
another
they
did
not
speak
because
they
were
going
to
have
a
party
as
soon
as
duchess
had
got
round
the
corner
out
of
sight
she
simply
ran
straight
away
to
ribby
house
illustration
ribby
went
into
the
shop
and
bought
what
she
required
and
came
out
after
a
pleasant
gossip
with
cousin
tabitha
twitchit
illustration
cousin
tabitha
was
disdainful
afterwards
in
conversation
a
little
indeed
just
as
if
there
were
no
cats
in
sawrey
and
a
for
afternoon
tea
the
very
idea
said
cousin
tabitha
twitchit
ribby
went
on
to
timothy
baker
and
bought
the
muffins
then
she
went
home
there
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
scuffling
noise
in
the
back
passage
as
she
was
coming
in
at
the
front
door
i
trust
that
is
not
that
pie
the
spoons
are
locked
up
however
said
ribby
but
there
was
nobody
there
ribby
opened
the
bottom
oven
door
with
some
difficulty
and
turned
the
pie
there
began
to
be
a
pleasing
smell
of
baked
mouse
illustration
where
is
the
pie
made
of
mouse
duchess
in
the
meantime
had
slipped
out
at
the
back
door
it
is
a
very
odd
thing
that
ribby
pie
was
in
the
oven
when
i
put
mine
in
and
i
ca
find
it
anywhere
i
have
looked
all
over
the
house
i
put
pie
into
a
nice
hot
oven
at
the
top
i
could
not
turn
any
of
the
other
handles
i
think
that
they
are
all
shams
said
duchess
but
i
wish
i
could
have
removed
the
pie
made
of
mouse
i
can
not
think
what
she
has
done
with
it
i
heard
ribby
coming
and
i
had
to
run
out
by
the
back
door
illustration
duchess
went
home
and
brushed
her
beautiful
black
coat
and
then
she
picked
a
bunch
of
flowers
in
her
garden
as
a
present
for
ribby
and
passed
the
time
until
the
clock
struck
four
ribby
having
assured
herself
by
careful
search
that
there
was
really
no
one
hiding
in
the
cupboard
or
in
the
larder
went
upstairs
to
change
her
dress
she
put
on
a
lilac
silk
gown
for
the
party
and
an
embroidered
muslin
apron
and
tippet
it
is
very
strange
said
ribby
i
did
not
i
left
that
drawer
pulled
out
has
somebody
been
trying
on
my
mittens
she
came
downstairs
again
and
made
the
tea
and
put
the
teapot
on
the
hob
she
peeped
again
into
the
oven
the
pie
had
become
a
lovely
brown
and
it
was
steaming
hot
illustration
ready
for
the
party
she
sat
down
before
the
fire
to
wait
for
the
little
dog
i
am
glad
i
used
the
oven
said
ribby
the
top
one
would
certainly
have
been
very
much
too
hot
i
wonder
why
that
cupboard
door
was
open
can
there
really
have
been
someone
in
the
house
very
punctually
at
four
duchess
started
to
go
to
the
party
she
ran
so
fast
through
the
village
that
she
was
too
early
and
she
had
to
wait
a
little
while
in
the
lane
that
leads
down
to
house
i
wonder
if
ribby
has
taken
pie
out
of
the
oven
yet
said
duchess
and
whatever
can
have
become
of
the
other
pie
made
of
mouse
illustration
at
a
quarter
past
four
to
the
minute
there
came
a
most
genteel
little
is
ribston
at
home
inquired
duchess
in
the
porch
come
in
and
how
do
you
do
my
dear
duchess
cried
ribby
i
hope
i
see
you
well
quite
well
i
thank
you
and
how
do
do
my
dear
ribby
said
duchess
i
brought
you
some
flowers
what
a
delicious
smell
of
pie
illustration
duchess
in
the
porch
oh
what
lovely
flowers
yes
it
is
mouse
and
bacon
do
not
talk
about
food
my
dear
ribby
said
duchess
what
a
lovely
white
is
it
done
to
a
turn
is
it
still
in
the
oven
i
think
it
wants
another
five
minutes
said
ribby
just
a
shade
longer
i
will
pour
out
the
tea
while
we
wait
do
you
take
sugar
my
dear
duchess
oh
yes
please
my
dear
ribby
and
may
i
have
a
lump
upon
my
nose
with
pleasure
my
dear
duchess
how
beautifully
you
beg
oh
how
sweetly
pretty
illustration
duchess
sat
up
with
the
sugar
on
her
nose
and
sniffed
how
good
that
pie
smells
i
do
love
veal
and
ham
i
mean
to
say
mouse
and
bacon
illustration
she
dropped
the
sugar
in
confusion
and
had
to
go
hunting
under
the
so
did
not
see
which
oven
ribby
opened
in
order
to
get
out
the
pie
ribby
set
the
pie
upon
the
table
there
was
a
very
savoury
smell
duchess
came
out
from
under
the
munching
sugar
and
sat
up
on
a
chair
i
will
first
cut
the
pie
for
you
i
am
going
to
have
muffin
and
marmalade
said
ribby
do
you
really
prefer
muffin
mind
the
illustration
i
beg
your
pardon
said
ribby
may
i
pass
you
the
marmalade
said
duchess
hurriedly
the
pie
proved
extremely
toothsome
and
the
muffins
light
and
hot
they
disappeared
rapidly
especially
the
pie
i
think
thought
the
duchess
to
herself
i
it
would
be
wiser
if
i
helped
myself
to
pie
though
ribby
did
not
seem
to
notice
anything
when
she
was
cutting
it
what
very
small
fine
pieces
it
has
cooked
into
i
did
not
remember
that
i
had
minced
it
up
so
fine
i
suppose
this
is
a
quicker
oven
than
my
own
illustration
how
fast
duchess
is
eating
thought
ribby
to
herself
as
she
buttered
her
fifth
muffin
illustration
the
was
emptying
rapidly
duchess
had
had
four
helps
already
and
was
fumbling
with
the
spoon
a
little
more
bacon
my
dear
duchess
said
ribby
thank
you
my
dear
ribby
i
was
only
feeling
for
the
illustration
where
is
the
the
my
dear
duchess
the
that
held
up
the
said
duchess
blushing
under
her
black
coat
oh
i
did
put
one
in
my
dear
duchess
said
ribby
i
do
think
that
it
is
necessary
in
pies
made
of
mouse
duchess
fumbled
with
the
spoon
i
ca
find
it
she
said
anxiously
there
is
a
said
ribby
looking
perplexed
yes
indeed
my
dear
ribby
where
can
it
have
gone
to
said
duchess
illustration
there
most
certainly
is
not
one
my
dear
duchess
i
disapprove
of
tin
articles
in
puddings
and
pies
it
is
most
undesirable
especially
when
people
swallow
in
lumps
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
duchess
looked
very
much
alarmed
and
continued
to
scoop
the
inside
of
the
my
squintina
grandmother
of
cousin
tabitha
twitchit
died
of
a
thimble
in
a
christmas
never
put
any
article
of
metal
in
puddings
or
pies
duchess
looked
aghast
and
tilted
up
the
i
have
only
four
and
they
are
all
in
the
cupboard
duchess
set
up
a
howl
i
shall
die
i
shall
die
i
have
swallowed
a
oh
my
dear
ribby
i
do
feel
so
ill
it
is
impossible
my
dear
duchess
there
was
not
a
duchess
moaned
and
whined
and
rocked
herself
about
oh
i
feel
so
dreadful
i
have
swallowed
a
there
was
in
the
pie
said
ribby
severely
yes
there
my
dear
ribby
i
am
sure
i
have
swallowed
it
let
me
prop
you
up
with
a
pillow
my
dear
duchess
where
do
you
think
you
feel
it
oh
i
do
feel
so
ill
me
my
dear
ribby
i
have
swallowed
a
large
tin
with
a
sharp
scalloped
edge
illustration
shall
i
run
for
the
doctor
i
will
just
lock
up
the
spoons
oh
yes
yes
fetch
maggotty
my
dear
ribby
he
is
a
pie
himself
he
will
certainly
understand
ribby
settled
duchess
in
an
armchair
before
the
fire
and
went
out
and
hurried
to
the
village
to
look
for
the
doctor
she
found
him
at
the
smithy
he
was
occupied
in
putting
rusty
nails
into
a
bottle
of
ink
which
he
had
obtained
at
the
post
office
gammon
ha
ha
said
he
with
his
head
on
one
side
ribby
explained
that
her
guest
had
swallowed
a
spinach
ha
ha
said
he
and
accompanied
her
with
alacrity
illustration
maggotty
mixture
he
hopped
so
fast
that
ribby
had
to
run
it
was
most
conspicuous
all
the
village
could
see
that
ribby
was
fetching
the
doctor
i
they
would
themselves
said
cousin
tabitha
twitchit
illustration
but
while
ribby
had
been
hunting
for
the
doctor
a
curious
thing
had
happened
to
duchess
who
had
been
left
by
herself
sitting
before
the
fire
sighing
and
groaning
and
feeling
very
unhappy
how
i
have
swallowed
it
such
a
large
thing
as
a
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
table
and
felt
inside
the
again
with
a
spoon
no
there
is
no
and
i
put
one
in
and
nobody
has
eaten
pie
except
me
so
i
must
have
swallowed
it
illustration
she
sat
down
again
and
stared
mournfully
at
the
grate
the
fire
crackled
and
danced
and
something
duchess
started
she
opened
the
door
of
the
oven
out
came
a
rich
steamy
flavour
of
veal
and
ham
and
there
stood
a
fine
brown
pie
and
through
a
hole
in
the
top
of
the
there
was
a
glimpse
of
a
little
tin
duchess
drew
a
long
breath
then
i
must
have
been
eating
mouse
no
wonder
i
feel
ill
but
perhaps
i
should
feel
worse
if
i
had
really
swallowed
a
duchess
reflected
what
a
very
awkward
thing
to
have
to
explain
to
ribby
i
think
i
will
put
pie
in
the
and
say
nothing
about
it
when
i
go
home
i
will
run
round
and
take
it
away
she
put
it
outside
the
and
sat
down
again
by
the
fire
and
shut
her
eyes
when
ribby
arrived
with
the
doctor
she
seemed
fast
asleep
illustration
gammon
ha
ha
said
the
doctor
i
am
feeling
very
much
better
said
duchess
waking
up
with
a
jump
i
am
truly
glad
to
hear
it
he
has
brought
you
a
pill
my
dear
duchess
i
think
i
should
feel
well
if
he
only
felt
my
pulse
said
duchess
backing
away
from
the
magpie
who
sidled
up
with
something
in
his
beak
it
is
only
a
bread
pill
you
had
much
better
take
it
drink
a
little
milk
my
dear
duchess
gammon
gammon
said
the
doctor
while
duchess
coughed
and
choked
do
say
that
again
said
ribby
losing
her
temper
here
take
this
bread
and
jam
and
get
out
into
the
yard
illustration
gammon
and
spinach
ha
ha
ha
shouted
maggotty
triumphantly
outside
the
back
door
i
am
feeling
very
much
better
my
dear
ribby
said
duchess
do
you
not
think
that
i
had
better
go
home
before
it
gets
dark
perhaps
it
might
be
wise
my
dear
duchess
i
will
lend
you
a
nice
warm
shawl
and
you
shall
take
my
arm
i
would
not
trouble
you
