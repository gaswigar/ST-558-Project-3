what
berry
found
i
the
hamiltons
fiction
has
said
so
much
in
regret
of
the
old
days
when
there
were
plantations
and
overseers
and
masters
and
slaves
that
it
was
good
to
come
upon
such
a
household
as
berry
hamilton
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
afforded
a
relief
from
the
monotony
of
tiresome
iteration
the
little
cottage
in
which
he
lived
with
his
wife
fannie
who
was
housekeeper
to
the
oakleys
and
his
son
and
daughter
joe
and
kit
sat
back
in
the
yard
some
hundred
paces
from
the
mansion
of
his
employer
it
was
somewhat
in
the
manner
of
the
old
cabin
in
the
quarters
with
which
usage
as
well
as
tradition
had
made
both
master
and
servant
familiar
but
unlike
the
cabin
of
the
elder
day
it
was
a
neatly
furnished
modern
house
the
home
of
a
typical
negro
for
twenty
years
berry
hamilton
had
been
butler
for
maurice
oakley
he
was
one
of
the
many
slaves
who
upon
their
accession
to
freedom
had
not
left
the
south
but
had
wandered
from
place
to
place
in
their
own
beloved
section
waiting
working
and
struggling
to
rise
with
its
rehabilitated
fortunes
the
first
faint
signs
of
recovery
were
being
seen
when
he
came
to
maurice
oakley
as
a
servant
through
thick
and
thin
he
remained
with
him
and
when
the
final
upward
tendency
of
his
employer
began
his
fortunes
had
increased
in
like
manner
when
having
married
oakley
bought
the
great
house
in
which
he
now
lived
he
left
the
little
servant
cottage
in
the
yard
for
as
he
said
laughingly
there
is
no
telling
when
berry
will
be
following
my
example
and
be
taking
a
wife
unto
himself
his
joking
prophecy
came
true
very
soon
berry
had
long
had
a
tenderness
for
fannie
the
housekeeper
as
she
retained
her
post
under
the
new
oakley
and
as
there
was
a
cottage
ready
to
his
hand
it
promised
to
be
cheaper
and
more
convenient
all
around
to
get
married
fannie
was
willing
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
fannie
had
never
regretted
her
choice
nor
had
berry
ever
had
cause
to
curse
his
utilitarian
ideas
the
stream
of
years
had
flowed
pleasantly
and
peacefully
with
them
their
little
sorrows
had
come
but
their
joys
had
been
many
as
time
went
on
the
little
cottage
grew
in
comfort
it
was
replenished
with
things
handed
down
from
the
house
from
time
to
time
and
with
others
bought
from
the
pair
earnings
berry
had
time
for
his
lodge
and
fannie
time
to
spare
for
her
own
house
and
garden
flowers
bloomed
in
the
little
plot
in
front
and
behind
it
vegetables
and
greens
testified
to
the
housewife
industry
over
the
door
of
the
little
house
a
fine
virginia
creeper
bent
and
fell
in
graceful
curves
and
a
cluster
of
insistent
clung
in
summer
about
its
stalwart
stock
it
was
into
this
bower
of
peace
and
comfort
that
joe
and
kitty
were
born
they
brought
a
new
sunlight
into
the
house
and
a
new
joy
to
the
father
and
mother
hearts
their
early
lives
were
pleasant
and
carefully
guarded
they
got
what
schooling
the
town
afforded
but
both
went
to
work
early
kitty
helping
her
mother
and
joe
learning
the
trade
of
barber
kit
was
the
delight
of
her
mother
life
she
was
a
pretty
cheery
little
thing
and
could
sing
like
a
lark
joe
too
was
of
a
cheerful
disposition
but
from
scraping
the
chins
of
aristocrats
came
to
imbibe
some
of
their
ideas
and
rather
too
early
in
life
bid
fair
to
be
a
dandy
but
his
father
encouraged
him
for
said
he

joe
her
own
eyes
would
follow
the
boy
lovingly
and
proudly
even
as
she
chided
she
could
not
say
very
much
either
for
berry
always
had
the
reply
that
she
was
spoiling
kit
out
of
all
reason
the
girl
did
have
the
prettiest
clothes
of
any
of
her
race
in
the
town
and
when
she
was
to
sing
for
the
benefit
of
the
church
or
for
the
benefit
of
her
father
society
the
tribe
of
benjamin
there
was
nothing
too
good
for
her
to
wear
in
this
too
they
were
aided
and
abetted
by
oakley
who
also
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
girl
so
the
two
doting
parents
had
their
chats
and
their
jokes
at
each
other
expense
and
went
bravely
on
doing
their
duties
and
spoiling
their
children
much
as
white
fathers
and
mothers
are
wont
to
do
what
the
less
fortunate
negroes
of
the
community
said
of
them
and
their
offspring
is
really
not
worth
while
envy
has
a
sharp
tongue
and
when
has
not
the
aristocrat
been
the
target
for
the
plebeian
sneers
joe
and
kit
were
respectively
eighteen
and
sixteen
at
the
time
when
the
preparations
for
maurice
oakley
farewell
dinner
to
his
brother
francis
were
agitating
the
whole
hamilton
household
all
of
them
had
a
hand
in
the
work
joe
had
shaved
the
two
men
kit
had
helped
oakley
maid
the
mother
had
fretted
herself
weak
over
the
shortcomings
of
a
cook
that
had
been
in
the
family
nearly
as
long
as
herself
while
berry
was
stern
and
dignified
in
anticipation
of
the
glorious
figure
he
was
to
make
in
serving
when
all
was
ready
peace
again
settled
upon
the
hamiltons
hamilton
in
the
whitest
of
white
aprons
prepared
to
be
on
hand
to
annoy
the
cook
still
more
kit
was
ready
to
station
herself
where
she
could
view
the
finery
joe
had
condescended
to
promise
to
be
home
in
time
to
eat
some
of
the
good
things
and
berry
berry
was
gorgeous
in
his
evening
suit
with
the
white
waistcoat
as
he
directed
the
nimble
waiters
hither
and
thither
ii
a
farewell
dinner
maurice
oakley
was
not
a
man
of
sudden
or
violent
enthusiasms
conservatism
was
the
quality
that
had
been
the
foundation
of
his
fortunes
at
a
time
when
the
disruption
of
the
country
had
involved
most
of
the
men
of
his
region
in
ruin
without
giving
any
one
ground
to
charge
him
with
being
lukewarm
or
renegade
to
his
cause
he
had
yet
so
adroitly
managed
his
affairs
that
when
peace
came
he
was
able
quickly
to
recover
much
of
the
ground
lost
during
the
war
with
a
rare
genius
for
adapting
himself
to
new
conditions
he
accepted
the
changed
order
of
things
with
a
passive
resignation
but
with
a
stern
determination
to
make
the
most
out
of
any
good
that
might
be
in
it
it
was
a
favourite
remark
of
his
that
there
must
be
some
good
in
every
system
and
it
was
the
duty
of
the
citizen
to
find
out
that
good
and
make
it
pay
he
had
done
this
his
house
his
reputation
his
satisfaction
were
all
evidences
that
he
had
succeeded
a
childless
man
he
bestowed
upon
his
younger
brother
francis
the
enthusiasm
he
would
have
given
to
a
son
his
wife
shared
with
her
husband
this
feeling
for
her
and
with
him
played
the
role
of
parent
which
had
otherwise
been
denied
her
it
was
true
that
francis
oakley
was
only
a
to
maurice
the
son
of
a
second
and
not
too
fortunate
marriage
but
there
was
no
halving
of
the
love
which
the
elder
man
had
given
to
him
from
childhood
up
at
the
first
intimation
that
francis
had
artistic
ability
his
brother
had
placed
him
under
the
best
masters
in
america
and
later
when
the
promise
of
his
youth
had
begun
to
blossom
he
sent
him
to
paris
although
the
expenditure
just
at
that
time
demanded
a
sacrifice
which
might
have
been
the
ruin
of
maurice
own
career
francis
promise
had
never
come
to
entire
fulfilment
he
was
always
trembling
on
the
verge
of
a
great
success
without
quite
plunging
into
it
despite
the
joy
which
his
presence
gave
his
brother
and
most
of
his
time
was
spent
abroad
where
he
could
find
just
the
atmosphere
that
suited
his
delicate
artistic
nature
after
a
visit
of
two
months
he
was
about
returning
to
paris
for
a
stay
of
five
years
at
last
he
was
going
to
apply
himself
steadily
and
try
to
be
less
the
dilettante
the
company
which
maurice
oakley
brought
together
to
say
to
his
brother
on
this
occasion
was
drawn
from
the
best
that
this
fine
old
southern
town
afforded
there
were
colonels
there
at
whose
titles
and
the
owners
rights
to
them
no
one
could
laugh
there
were
brilliant
women
there
who
had
queened
it
in
richmond
baltimore
louisville
and
new
orleans
and
every
southern
capital
under
the
old
regime
and
there
were
younger
ones
there
of
wit
and
beauty
who
were
just
beginning
to
hold
their
court
for
francis
was
a
great
favourite
both
with
men
and
women
he
was
a
handsome
man
tall
slender
and
graceful
he
had
the
face
and
brow
of
a
poet
a
pallid
face
framed
in
a
mass
of
dark
hair
there
was
a
touch
of
weakness
in
his
mouth
but
this
was
shaded
and
half
hidden
by
a
full
mustache
that
made
much
forgivable
to
eyes
it
was
generally
conceded
that
oakley
was
a
hostess
whose
guests
had
no
awkward
before
dinner
no
praise
could
be
higher
than
this
and
she
had
no
need
to
exert
herself
to
maintain
this
reputation
her
was
the
life
of
the
assembly
he
had
wit
and
daring
and
about
him
there
was
just
that
hint
of
charming
danger
that
made
him
irresistible
to
women
the
guests
heard
the
dinner
announced
with
surprise
an
unusual
thing
except
in
this
house
both
maurice
oakley
and
his
wife
looked
fondly
at
the
artist
as
he
went
in
with
claire
lessing
he
was
talking
animatedly
to
the
girl
having
changed
the
general
trend
of
the
conversation
to
a
manner
and
tone
directed
more
particularly
to
her
while
she
listened
to
him
her
face
glowed
and
her
eyes
shone
with
a
light
that
every
man
could
not
bring
into
them
as
maurice
and
his
wife
followed
him
with
their
gaze
the
same
thought
was
in
their
minds
and
it
had
not
just
come
to
them
why
could
not
francis
marry
claire
lessing
and
settle
in
america
instead
of
going
back
ever
and
again
to
that
life
in
the
latin
quarter
they
did
not
believe
that
it
was
a
bad
life
or
a
dissipated
one
but
from
the
little
that
they
had
seen
of
it
when
they
were
in
paris
it
was
at
least
a
bit
too
free
and
unconventional
for
their
traditions
there
were
too
temptations
which
must
assail
any
man
of
francis
looks
and
talents
they
had
perfect
faith
in
the
strength
of
his
manhood
of
course
but
could
they
have
had
their
way
it
would
have
been
their
will
to
hedge
him
about
so
that
no
breath
of
evil
invitation
could
have
come
nigh
to
him
but
this
younger
brother
this
half
ward
of
theirs
was
an
unruly
member
he
talked
and
laughed
rode
and
walked
with
claire
lessing
with
the
same
free
abandon
the
same
show
of
uninterested
good
comradeship
that
he
had
used
towards
her
when
they
were
boy
and
girl
together
there
was
not
a
shade
more
of
warmth
or
in
his
manner
towards
her
than
there
had
been
fifteen
years
before
in
fact
there
was
less
for
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
was
six
and
claire
three
that
francis
with
a
boldness
that
the
lover
of
maturer
years
tries
vainly
to
attain
had
announced
to
claire
that
he
was
going
to
marry
her
but
he
had
never
renewed
this
declaration
when
it
came
time
that
it
would
carry
weight
with
it
they
made
a
fine
picture
as
they
sat
together
one
seeing
them
could
hardly
help
thinking
on
the
instant
that
they
were
made
for
each
other
something
in
the
woman
face
in
her
expression
perhaps
supplied
a
palpable
lack
in
the
man
the
strength
of
her
mouth
and
chin
helped
the
weakness
of
his
she
was
the
sort
of
woman
who
if
ever
he
came
to
a
great
moral
crisis
in
his
life
would
be
able
to
save
him
if
she
were
near
and
yet
he
was
going
away
from
her
giving
up
the
pearl
that
he
had
only
to
put
out
his
hand
to
take
some
of
these
thoughts
were
in
the
minds
of
the
brother
and
sister
now
five
years
does
seem
a
long
while
francis
was
saying
but
if
a
man
accomplishes
anything
after
all
it
seems
only
a
short
time
to
look
back
upon
all
time
is
short
to
look
back
upon
it
is
the
looking
forward
to
it
that
counts
it
does
though
with
a
man
i
suppose
he
doing
something
all
the
while
yes
a
man
is
always
doing
something
even
if
only
waiting
but
waiting
is
such
unheroic
business
that
is
the
part
that
usually
falls
to
a
woman
lot
i
have
no
doubt
that
some
mademoiselle
is
waiting
for
you
now
francis
laughed
and
flushed
hotly
claire
noted
the
flush
and
wondered
at
it
had
she
indeed
hit
upon
the
real
point
was
that
the
reason
that
he
was
so
anxious
to
get
back
to
paris
the
thought
struck
a
chill
through
her
gaiety
she
did
not
want
to
be
suspicious
but
what
was
the
cause
of
that
flush
he
was
not
a
man
easily
disconcerted
then
why
so
but
her
companion
talked
on
with
such
innocent
composure
that
she
believed
herself
mistaken
as
to
the
reason
for
his
momentary
confusion
someone
cried
gayly
across
the
table
to
her
oh
miss
claire
you
will
not
dare
to
talk
with
such
little
awe
to
our
friend
when
he
comes
back
with
his
ribbons
and
his
medals
why
we
shall
all
have
to
bow
to
you
frank
you
wronging
me
esterton
said
francis
no
foreign
decoration
could
ever
be
to
me
as
much
as
the
flower
of
approval
from
the
fair
women
of
my
own
state
hear
cried
the
ladies
trust
artists
and
poets
to
pay
pretty
compliments
and
this
wily
friend
of
mine
pays
his
at
my
expense
a
good
bit
of
generalship
that
frank
an
old
military
man
broke
in
esterton
opened
the
breach
and
you
at
once
galloped
in
that
the
highest
art
of
war
claire
was
looking
at
her
companion
had
he
meant
the
approval
of
the
women
or
was
it
one
woman
that
he
cared
for
had
the
speech
had
a
hidden
meaning
for
her
she
could
never
tell
she
could
not
understand
this
man
who
had
been
so
much
to
her
for
so
long
and
yet
did
not
seem
to
know
it
who
was
full
of
romance
and
fire
and
passion
and
yet
looked
at
her
beauty
with
the
eyes
of
a
mere
comrade
she
sighed
as
she
rose
with
the
rest
of
the
women
to
leave
the
table
the
men
lingered
over
their
cigars
the
wine
was
old
and
the
stories
new
what
more
could
they
ask
there
was
a
strong
glow
in
francis
oakley
face
and
his
laugh
was
frequent
and
ringing
some
discussion
came
up
which
sent
him
running
up
to
his
room
for
a
bit
of
evidence
when
he
came
down
it
was
not
to
come
directly
to
the
he
paused
in
the
hall
and
despatched
a
servant
to
bring
his
brother
to
him
maurice
found
him
standing
weakly
against
the
railing
of
the
stairs
something
in
his
air
impressed
his
brother
strangely
what
is
it
francis
he
questioned
hurrying
to
him
i
have
just
discovered
a
considerable
loss
was
the
reply
in
a
grieved
voice
if
it
is
no
worse
than
loss
i
am
glad
but
what
is
it
every
cent
of
money
that
i
had
to
secure
my
letter
of
credit
is
gone
from
my
bureau
what
when
did
it
disappear
i
went
to
my
bureau
for
something
and
found
the
money
gone
then
i
remembered
that
when
i
opened
it
two
days
ago
i
must
have
left
the
key
in
the
lock
as
i
found
it
it
a
bad
business
but
do
let
talk
of
it
now
come
let
go
back
to
our
guests
do
look
so
cut
up
about
it
frank
old
man
it
is
as
bad
as
it
might
be
and
you
must
show
a
gloomy
face
the
younger
man
pulled
himself
together
and
the
room
with
his
brother
in
a
few
minutes
his
gaiety
had
apparently
returned
when
they
rejoined
the
ladies
even
their
quick
eyes
could
detect
in
his
demeanour
no
trace
of
the
annoying
thing
that
had
occurred
his
face
did
not
change
until
with
a
wealth
of
fervent
congratulations
he
had
bade
the
last
guest
then
he
turned
to
his
brother
when
leslie
is
in
bed
come
into
the
library
i
will
wait
for
you
there
he
said
and
walked
sadly
away
poor
foolish
frank
mused
his
brother
as
if
the
loss
could
matter
to
him
iii
the
theft
frank
was
very
pale
when
his
brother
finally
came
to
him
at
the
appointed
place
he
sat
limply
in
his
chair
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
come
brace
up
now
frank
and
tell
me
about
it
at
the
sound
of
his
brother
voice
he
started
and
looked
up
as
though
he
had
been
dreaming
i
do
know
what
you
think
of
me
maurice
he
said
i
have
never
before
been
guilty
of
such
criminal
carelessness
do
stop
to
accuse
yourself
our
only
hope
in
this
matter
lies
in
prompt
action
where
was
the
money
in
the
oak
cabinet
and
lying
in
the
bureau
drawer
such
a
thing
as
a
theft
seemed
so
foreign
to
this
place
that
i
was
never
very
particular
about
the
box
but
i
did
not
know
until
i
went
to
it
that
the
last
time
i
had
opened
it
i
had
forgotten
to
take
the
key
out
it
all
flashed
over
me
in
a
second
when
i
saw
it
shining
there
even
then
i
did
suspect
anything
you
do
know
how
i
felt
to
open
that
cabinet
and
find
all
my
money
gone
it
awful
do
worry
how
much
was
there
in
all
nine
hundred
and
dollars
most
of
which
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
had
accepted
from
you
you
have
no
right
to
talk
that
way
frank
you
know
i
do
not
begrudge
a
cent
you
want
i
have
never
felt
that
my
father
did
quite
right
in
leaving
me
the
bulk
of
the
fortune
but
we
wo
discuss
that
now
what
i
want
you
to
understand
though
is
that
the
money
is
yours
as
well
as
mine
and
you
are
always
welcome
to
it
the
artist
shook
his
head
no
maurice
he
said
i
can
accept
no
more
from
you
i
have
already
used
up
all
my
own
money
and
too
much
of
yours
in
this
hopeless
fight
i
do
suppose
i
was
ever
cut
out
for
an
artist
or
i
have
done
something
really
notable
in
this
time
and
would
not
be
a
burden
upon
those
who
care
for
me
no
i
give
up
going
to
paris
and
find
some
work
to
do
frank
frank
be
silent
this
is
nonsense
give
up
your
art
you
shall
not
do
it
you
shall
go
to
paris
as
usual
leslie
and
i
have
perfect
faith
in
you
you
shall
not
give
up
on
account
of
this
misfortune
what
are
the
few
paltry
dollars
to
me
or
to
you
nothing
nothing
i
know
it
is
the
money
it
the
principle
of
the
thing
principle
be
hanged
you
go
back
to
paris
just
as
you
had
planned
i
do
not
ask
it
i
command
it
the
younger
man
looked
up
quickly
pardon
me
frank
for
using
those
words
and
at
such
a
time
you
know
how
near
my
heart
your
success
lies
and
to
hear
you
talk
of
giving
it
all
up
makes
me
forget
myself
forgive
me
but
you
go
back
you
you
are
too
good
maurice
said
frank
impulsively
and
i
will
go
back
and
i
try
to
redeem
myself
there
is
no
redeeming
of
yourself
to
do
my
dear
boy
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
mature
yourself
we
have
a
detective
down
and
see
what
we
can
do
in
this
matter
frank
gave
a
scarcely
perceptible
start
i
do
so
hate
such
things
he
said
and
anyway
what
the
use
they
never
find
out
where
the
stuff
went
to
oh
you
need
not
be
troubled
in
this
matter
i
know
that
such
things
must
jar
on
your
delicate
nature
but
i
am
a
plain
business
man
and
i
can
attend
to
it
without
distaste
but
i
hate
to
shove
everything
unpleasant
off
on
you
it
what
i
been
doing
all
my
life
never
mind
that
now
tell
me
who
was
the
last
person
you
remember
in
your
room
oh
esterton
was
up
there
awhile
before
dinner
but
he
was
not
alone
two
minutes
why
he
would
be
out
of
the
question
anyway
who
else
hamilton
was
up
yesterday
alone
yes
for
a
while
his
boy
joe
shaved
me
and
jack
was
up
for
a
while
brushing
my
clothes
then
it
lies
between
jack
and
joe
frank
hesitated
neither
one
was
left
alone
though
then
only
hamilton
and
esterton
have
been
alone
for
any
time
in
your
room
since
you
left
the
key
in
your
cabinet
those
are
the
only
ones
of
whom
i
know
anything
what
others
went
in
during
the
day
of
course
i
know
nothing
about
it
could
have
been
either
esterton
or
hamilton
not
esterton
no
and
hamilton
is
beyond
suspicion
no
servant
is
beyond
suspicion
i
would
trust
hamilton
anywhere
said
frank
stoutly
and
with
anything
that
noble
of
you
frank
and
i
would
have
done
the
same
but
we
must
remember
that
we
are
not
in
the
old
days
now
the
negroes
are
becoming
less
faithful
and
less
contented
and
more
the
pity
and
a
deal
more
ambitious
although
i
have
never
had
any
unfaithfulness
on
the
part
of
hamilton
to
complain
of
before
then
do
not
condemn
him
now
i
shall
not
condemn
any
one
until
i
have
proof
positive
of
his
guilt
or
such
clear
circumstantial
evidence
that
my
reason
is
satisfied
i
do
not
believe
that
you
will
ever
have
that
against
old
hamilton
this
spirit
of
trust
does
you
credit
frank
and
i
very
much
hope
that
you
may
be
right
but
as
soon
as
a
negro
like
hamilton
learns
the
value
of
money
and
begins
to
earn
it
at
the
same
time
he
begins
to
covet
some
easy
and
rapid
way
of
securing
it
the
old
negro
knew
nothing
of
the
value
of
money
when
he
stole
he
stole
hams
and
bacon
and
chickens
these
were
his
immediate
necessities
and
the
things
he
valued
the
present
laughs
at
this
tendency
without
knowing
the
cause
the
present
negro
resents
the
laugh
and
he
has
learned
to
value
other
things
than
those
which
satisfy
his
belly
frank
looked
bored
but
pardon
me
for
boring
you
i
know
you
want
to
go
to
bed
go
and
leave
everything
to
me
the
young
man
reluctantly
withdrew
and
maurice
went
to
the
telephone
and
rung
up
the
police
station
as
maurice
had
said
he
was
a
plain
business
man
and
it
took
very
few
words
for
him
to
put
the
chief
of
police
in
possession
of
the
principal
facts
of
the
case
a
detective
was
detailed
to
take
charge
of
the
case
and
was
started
immediately
so
that
he
might
be
upon
the
ground
as
soon
after
the
commission
of
the
crime
as
possible
when
he
came
he
insisted
that
if
he
was
to
do
anything
he
must
question
the
robbed
man
and
search
his
room
at
once
oakley
protested
but
the
detective
was
adamant
even
now
the
presence
in
the
room
of
a
man
uninitiated
into
the
mysteries
of
criminal
methods
might
be
destroying
the
last
vestige
of
a
really
important
clue
the
master
of
the
house
had
no
alternative
save
to
yield
together
they
went
to
the
artist
room
a
light
shone
out
through
the
crack
under
the
door
i
am
sorry
to
disturb
you
again
frank
but
may
we
come
in
who
is
with
you
the
detective
i
did
not
know
he
was
to
come
the
chief
thought
it
better
all
right
in
a
moment
there
was
a
sound
of
moving
around
and
in
a
short
time
the
young
fellow
partly
undressed
opened
the
door
to
the
detective
questions
he
answered
in
substance
what
he
had
told
before
he
also
brought
out
the
cabinet
it
was
a
strong
oak
box
uncarven
but
bound
at
the
edges
with
brass
the
key
was
still
in
the
lock
where
frank
had
left
it
on
discovering
his
loss
they
raised
the
lid
the
cabinet
contained
two
compartments
one
for
letters
and
a
smaller
one
for
jewels
and
trinkets
when
you
opened
this
cabinet
your
money
was
gone
yes
were
any
of
your
papers
touched
no
how
about
your
jewels
i
have
but
few
and
they
were
elsewhere
the
detective
examined
the
room
carefully
its
approaches
and
the
without
he
paused
knowingly
at
a
window
that
overlooked
the
flat
top
of
a
porch
do
you
ever
leave
this
window
open
it
is
almost
always
so
is
this
porch
on
the
front
of
the
house
no
on
the
side
what
else
is
out
that
way
frank
and
maurice
looked
at
each
other
the
younger
man
hesitated
and
put
his
hand
to
his
head
maurice
answered
grimly
my
butler
cottage
is
on
that
side
and
a
little
way
back
uh
huh
and
your
butler
is
i
believe
the
hamilton
whom
the
young
gentleman
mentioned
some
time
ago
yes
frank
face
was
really
very
white
now
the
detective
nodded
again
i
think
i
have
a
clue
he
said
simply
i
will
be
here
again
morning
but
i
shall
be
gone
said
frank
you
will
hardly
be
needed
anyway
the
artist
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
he
hated
to
be
involved
in
unpleasant
things
he
went
as
far
as
the
outer
door
with
his
brother
and
the
detective
as
he
bade
the
officer
and
hurried
up
the
hall
frank
put
his
hand
to
his
head
again
with
a
convulsive
gesture
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
pain
come
come
frank
you
must
take
a
drink
now
and
go
to
bed
said
oakley
i
am
completely
unnerved
i
know
it
and
i
am
no
less
shocked
than
you
but
we
got
to
face
it
like
men
they
passed
into
the
where
maurice
poured
out
some
brandy
for
his
brother
and
himself
who
would
have
thought
it
he
asked
as
he
tossed
his
own
down
not
i
had
hoped
against
hope
up
until
the
last
that
it
would
turn
out
to
be
a
mistake
nothing
angers
me
so
much
as
being
deceived
by
the
man
i
have
helped
and
trusted
i
should
feel
the
sting
of
all
this
much
less
if
the
thief
had
come
from
the
outside
broken
in
and
robbed
me
but
this
after
all
these
years
is
too
low
do
be
hard
on
a
man
maurice
one
never
knows
what
prompts
him
to
a
deed
and
this
evidence
is
all
circumstantial
it
is
plain
enough
for
me
you
are
entirely
too
frank
but
i
see
that
this
thing
has
worn
you
out
you
must
not
stand
here
talking
go
to
bed
for
you
must
be
fresh
for
journey
to
new
york
frank
oakley
turned
away
towards
his
room
his
face
was
haggard
and
he
staggered
as
he
walked
his
brother
looked
after
him
with
a
pitying
and
affectionate
gaze
poor
fellow
he
said
he
is
so
delicately
constructed
that
he
can
not
stand
such
shocks
as
these
and
then
he
added
to
think
of
that
black
hound
treachery
i
give
him
all
that
the
law
sets
down
for
him
he
found
oakley
asleep
when
he
reached
the
room
but
he
awakened
her
to
tell
her
the
story
she
was
it
was
hard
to
have
to
believe
this
awful
thing
of
an
old
servant
but
she
agreed
with
him
that
hamilton
must
be
made
an
example
of
when
the
time
came
before
that
however
he
must
not
know
that
he
was
suspected
they
fell
asleep
he
with
thoughts
of
anger
and
revenge
and
she
grieved
and
disappointed
iv
from
a
clear
sky
the
inmates
of
the
oakley
house
had
not
been
long
in
their
beds
before
hamilton
was
out
of
his
and
rousing
his
own
little
household
you
joe
he
called
to
his
son

it
was
a
cool
autumn
morning
fresh
and
the
sun
was
just
rising
and
a
cool
clear
breeze
was
blowing
across
the
land
the
blue
smoke
from
the
house
where
the
fire
was
already
going
whirled
fantastically
over
the
roofs
like
a
belated
ghost
it
was
just
the
morning
to
doze
in
comfort
and
so
thought
all
of
berry
household
except
himself
loud
was
the
complaining
as
they
threw
themselves
out
of
bed
they
maintained
that
it
was
an
altogether
unearthly
hour
to
get
up
even
hamilton
added
her
protest
until
she
suddenly
remembered
what
morning
it
was
when
she
hurried
into
her
clothes
and
set
about
getting
the
family
breakfast
the
of
all
of
them
returned
when
they
were
seated
about
their
table
with
some
of
the
good
things
of
the
night
before
set
out
and
the
talk
ran
cheerily
around
i

hamilton

kitty
joe
did
not
condescend
to
join
in
the
conversation
but
contented
himself
with
devouring
the
good
things
and
aping
the
manners
of
the
young
men
whom
he
knew
had
been
among
last
night
guests

he
went
out
cheerily
to
his
work
no
shadow
of
impending
disaster
depressed
his
spirits
no
cloud
obscured
his
sky
he
was
a
simple
easy
man
and
he
saw
nothing
in
the
manner
of
the
people
whom
he
served
that
morning
at
breakfast
save
a
natural
grief
at
parting
from
each
other
he
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
inquire
who
the
strange
white
man
was
who
hung
about
the
place
when
it
came
time
for
the
young
man
to
leave
with
the
privilege
of
an
old
servitor
berry
went
up
to
him
to
bid
him
he
held
out
his
hand
to
him
and
with
a
glance
at
his
brother
frank
took
it
and
shook
it
cordially
berry
he
said
maurice
could
hardly
restrain
his
anger
at
the
sight
but
his
wife
was
moved
to
tears
at
her
generosity
the
last
sight
they
saw
as
the
carriage
rolled
away
towards
the
station
was
berry
standing
upon
the
steps
waving
a
hearty
farewell
and
how
could

gasped
his
brother
as
soon
as
they
had
driven
well
out
of
hearing

very
noble
of

be
too
hard
on

a
little
scare
and
let
him
go

buried
the
money
anyhow
i
shall
deal
with
him
as
he
deserves
the
young
man
sighed
and
was
silent
the
rest
of
the
way
whether
i
fail
or
succeed
you
will
always
think
well
of
me
maurice
he
said
in
parting
and
if
i
do
come
up
to
your
expectations
well

me
that
all
his
brother
wrung
his
hand

will
always
come
up
to
my
expectations
frank
he
said
wo
he
leslie
he
will
always
be
our
frank
our
good
noble
boy
god
bless
him
the
young
fellow
bade
them
a
hearty
and
they
knowing
what
his
feelings
must
be
spared
him
the
prolonging
of
the
strain
they
waited
in
the
carriage
and
he
waved
to
them
as
the
train
rolled
out
of
the
station
he
seems
to
be
sad
at
going
said
oakley
poor
fellow
the
affair
of
last
night
has
broken
him
up
considerably
but
i
make
berry
pay
for
every
pang
of
anxiety
that
my
brother
has
suffered
do
be
revengeful
maurice
you
know
what
brother
frank
asked
of
you
he
is
gone
and
will
never
know
what
happens
so
i
may
be
as
revengeful
as
i
wish
the
detective
was
waiting
on
the
lawn
when
maurice
oakley
returned
they
went
immediately
to
the
library
oakley
walking
with
the
firm
hard
tread
of
a
man
who
is
both
exasperated
and
determined
and
the
officer
gliding
along
with
the
step
which
is
one
of
the
attributes
of
his
profession
well
was
the
impatient
man
question
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
upon
them
i
have
some
more
information
that
may
or
may
not
be
of
importance
out
with
it
maybe
i
can
tell
first
let
me
ask
if
you
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
your
butler
had
any
resources
of
his
own
say
to
the
amount
of
three
or
four
hundred
dollars
certainly
not
i
pay
him
thirty
dollars
a
month
and
his
wife
fifteen
dollars
and
with
keeping
up
his
lodges
and
the
way
he
dresses
that
girl
he
ca
save
very
much
you
know
that
he
has
money
in
the
bank
no
well
he
has
over
eight
hundred
dollars
what
berry
it
must
be
the
pickings
of
years
and
yesterday
it
was
increased
by
five
hundred
more
the
scoundrel
how
was
your
brother
money
in
bills
it
was
in
large
bills
and
gold
with
some
silver
berry
money
was
almost
all
in
bills
of
a
small
denomination
and
silver
a
poor
trick
it
could
easily
have
been
changed
not
such
a
sum
without
exciting
comment
he
may
have
gone
to
several
places
but
he
had
only
a
day
to
do
it
in
then
some
one
must
have
been
his
accomplice
that
remains
to
be
proven
nothing
remains
to
be
proven
why
it
as
clear
as
day
that
the
money
he
has
is
the
result
of
a
long
series
of
peculations
and
that
this
last
is
the
result
of
his
first
large
theft
that
must
be
made
clear
to
the
law
it
shall
be
i
should
advise
though
no
open
proceedings
against
this
servant
until
further
evidence
to
establish
his
guilt
is
found
if
the
evidence
satisfies
me
it
must
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
any
ordinary
jury
i
demand
his
immediate
arrest
as
you
will
sir
will
you
have
him
called
here
and
question
him
or
will
you
let
me
question
him
at
once
yes
oakley
struck
the
bell
and
berry
himself
answered
it
you
just
the
man
we
want
said
oakley
shortly
berry
looked
astonished

the

he
strove
to
calm
himself
you

better
let

talk

said
the
officer
oakley
nodded
berry

looking
distressed
and
excited

at

the
officer
pursued

with
soon
fannie
was
summoned
and
when
the
matter
was
explained
to
her
first
gave
evidences
of
giving
way
to
grief
but
when
the
detective
began
to
question
her
she
calmed
herself
and
answered
directly
just
as
her
husband
had
well
posted
sneered

that
man

had
begun
to
look
more
hopeful
during
fannie
recital
but
now
the
ashen
look
came
back
into
his
face
at
the
word
arrest
his
wife
collapsed
utterly
and
sobbed
on
her
husband
shoulder

but
the

between
them
take
that
damned
hound
away
or
by
god
i
do
him
violence
the
two
men
stood
fiercely
facing
each
other
then
the
handcuffs
were
snapped
on
the
servant
wrist
no
no
shrieked
fannie
you

you

oh

she
nevah

it
she
sped
from
the
room
the
commotion
had
called
a
crowd
of
curious
servants
into
the
hall
fannie
hardly
saw
them
as
she
dashed
among
them
crying
for
her
mistress
in
a
moment
she
returned
dragging
oakley
by
the
hand
tell
oh
tell
miss
leslie
dat
you
do
believe
it
let
berry
why
fannie
i
ca

it
all
seems
perfectly
plain
and
oakley
knows
better
than
any
of
us
you
know
fannie
her
last
hope
gone
flung
herself
on
the
floor
crying
o
gawd
o
gawd
he
gone
fu
sho
her
husband
bent
over
her
the
tears
dropping
from
his
eyes
nevah
min
fannie
he
said
nevah
min
hit
boun
to
come
out
all
right
she
raised
her
head
and
seizing
his
manacled
hands
pressed
them
to
her
breast
wailing
in
a
low
monotone
gone
gone
they
disengaged
her
hands
and
led
berry
away
take
her
out
said
oakley
sternly
to
the
servants
and
they
lifted
her
up
and
carried
her
away
in
a
sort
of
dumb
stupor
that
was
half
a
swoon
they
took
her
to
her
little
cottage
and
laid
her
down
until
she
could
come
to
herself
and
the
full
horror
of
her
situation
burst
upon
her
v
the
justice
of
men
the
arrest
of
berry
hamilton
on
the
charge
preferred
by
his
employer
was
the
cause
of
unusual
commotion
in
the
town
both
the
accuser
and
the
accused
were
well
known
to
the
citizens
white
and
black
maurice
oakley
as
a
solid
man
of
business
and
berry
as
an
honest
sensible
negro
and
the
pink
of
good
servants
the
evening
papers
had
a
full
story
of
the
crime
which
closed
by
saying
that
the
prisoner
had
amassed
a
considerable
sum
of
money
it
was
very
likely
from
a
long
series
of
smaller
peculations
it
seems
a
strange
irony
upon
the
force
of
right
living
that
this
man
who
had
never
been
arrested
before
who
had
never
even
been
suspected
of
should
find
so
few
who
even
at
the
first
telling
doubted
the
story
of
his
guilt
many
people
began
to
remember
things
that
had
looked
particularly
suspicious
in
his
dealings
some
others
said
i
did
think
it
of
him
there
were
only
a
few
who
dared
to
say
i
believe
it
of
him
the
first
act
of
his
lodge
the
tribe
of
benjamin
whose
treasurer
he
was
was
to
have
his
accounts
audited
when
they
should
have
been
visiting
him
with
comfort
and
they
seemed
personally
grieved
when
his
books
were
found
to
be
straight
the
church
of
which
he
had
been
an
honest
and
active
member
hastened
to
disavow
sympathy
with
him
and
to
purge
itself
of
contamination
by
turning
him
out
his
friends
were
afraid
to
visit
him
and
were
silent
when
his
enemies
gloated
on
every
side
one
might
have
asked
where
is
charity
and
gone
away
empty
in
the
black
people
of
the
town
the
strong
influence
of
slavery
was
still
operative
and
with
one
accord
they
turned
away
from
one
of
their
own
kind
upon
whom
had
been
set
the
ban
of
the
white
displeasure
if
they
had
sympathy
they
dared
not
show
it
their
own
interests
the
safety
of
their
own
positions
and
firesides
demanded
that
they
stand
aloof
from
the
criminal
not
then
not
now
nor
has
it
ever
been
true
although
it
has
been
claimed
that
negroes
either
harbour
or
sympathise
with
the
criminal
of
their
kind
they
did
not
dare
to
do
it
before
the
sixties
they
do
not
dare
to
do
it
now
they
have
brought
down
as
a
heritage
from
the
days
of
their
bondage
both
fear
and
disloyalty
so
berry
was
unbefriended
while
the
storm
raged
around
him
the
cell
where
they
had
placed
him
was
kind
to
him
and
he
could
not
hear
the
envious
and
sneering
comments
that
went
on
about
him
this
was
kind
for
the
tongues
of
his
enemies
were
not
tell
me
tell
me
said
one
you
need
tell
me
dat
a
bird
kin
fly
so
high
dat

minty
when
she
met
huh
on
de
street
i
reckon
she
come
down
huh
high
hoss
now
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
minty
brown
was
no
better
than
she
should
have
been
and
did
not
deserve
to
be
spoken
to
but
none
of
this
was
taken
into
account
either
by
the
speaker
or
the
hearers
the
man
was
down
it
was
time
to
strike
the
women
too
joined
their
shrill
voices
to
the
general
cry
and
were
loud
in
their
abuse
of
the
hamiltons
and
in
disparagement
of
their
airs
i
knowed
it
i
knowed
it
mumbled
one
old
crone
rolling
her
bleared
and
jealous
eyes
with
glee
you

an
ef

ai

to
say
the
women
suddenly
became
interested
in
this
half
assertion
and
the
old
hag
seeing
that
she
had
made
the
desired
impression
lapsed
into
silence
the
whites
were
not
neglecting
to
review
and
comment
on
the
case
also
it
had
been
long
since
so
great
a
bit
of
in
a
negro
had
given
them
cause
for
speculation
and
recrimination
i
tell
you
said
old
horace
talbot
who
was
noted
for
his
kindliness
towards
people
of
colour
i
tell
you
i
pity
that
darky
more
than
i
blame
him
now
here
my
theory
they
were
in
the
bar
of
the
continental
hotel
and
the
old
gentleman
sipped
his
liquor
as
he
talked
it
just
like
this
the
north
thought
they
were
doing
a
great
thing
when
they
come
down
here
and
freed
all
the
slaves
they
thought
they
were
doing
a
great
thing
and
i
not
saying
a
word
against
them
i
give
them
the
credit
for
having
the
courage
of
their
convictions
but
i
maintain
that
they
were
all
wrong
now
in
turning
these
people
loose
upon
the
country
the
way
they
did
without
knowledge
of
what
the
first
principle
of
liberty
was
the
natural
result
is
that
these
people
are
irresponsible
they
are
unacquainted
with
the
ways
of
our
higher
civilisation
and
it
take
them
a
long
time
to
learn
you
know
rome
was
built
in
a
day
i
know
berry
and
i
known
him
for
a
long
while
and
a
politer
likelier
darky
than
him
you
would
have
to
go
far
to
find
and
i
have
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
that
he
took
that
money
absolutely
without
a
thought
of
wrong
sir
absolutely
he
saw
it
he
took
it
and
to
his
mental
process
that
was
the
end
of
it
to
him
there
was
no
injury
inflicted
on
any
one
there
was
no
crime
committed
his
elemental
reasoning
was
simply
this
this
man
has
more
money
than
i
have
here
is
some
of
his
surplus
i
just
take
it
why
gentlemen
i
maintain
that
that
man
took
that
money
with
the
same
innocence
of
purpose
with
which
one
of
our
servants
a
few
years
ago
would
have
appropriated
a
stray
ham
i
disagree
with
you
entirely
talbot
broke
in
beachfield
davis
who
was
a
mighty
make
mine
the
same
jerry
only
add
a
little
i
disagree
with
you
it
simply
total
depravity
that
all
all
niggers
are
alike
and
there
no
use
trying
to
do
anything
with
them
look
at
that
man
dodson
of
mine
i
had
one
of
the
finest
young
hounds
in
the
state
you
know
that
white
pup
of
mine
talbot
that
i
bought
from
hiram
gaskins
mighty
fine
breed
well
i
was
spendin
all
my
time
and
patience
trainin
that
dog
in
the
daytime
at
night
i
put
him
in
that
nigger
care
to
feed
and
bed
well
do
you
know
i
came
home
the
other
night
and
found
that
black
rascal
gone
i
went
out
to
see
if
the
dog
was
properly
bedded
and
by
jove
the
dog
was
gone
too
then
i
got
suspicious
when
a
nigger
and
a
dog
go
out
together
at
night
one
draws
certain
conclusions
i
thought
i
had
heard
way
out
towards
the
edge
of
the
town
so
i
stayed
outside
and
watched
in
about
an
hour
here
came
dodson
with
a
possum
hung
over
his
shoulder
and
my
dog
trottin
at
his
heels
he
been
possum
huntin
with
my
hound
with
the
finest
hound
in
the
state
sir
now
i
appeal
to
you
all
gentlemen
if
that
ai
total
depravity
what
is
total
depravity
not
total
depravity
beachfield
i
maintain
but
the
very
irresponsibility
of
which
i
have
spoken
why
gentlemen
i
foresee
the
day
when
these
people
themselves
shall
come
to
us
southerners
of
their
own
accord
and
ask
to
be
until
such
time
as
they
shall
be
fit
for
freedom
old
horace
was
nothing
if
not
logical
well
do
you
think
there
any
doubt
of
the
darky
guilt
asked
colonel
saunders
hesitatingly
he
was
the
only
man
who
had
ever
thought
of
such
a
possibility
they
turned
on
him
as
if
he
had
been
some
strange
unnatural
animal
any
doubt
cried
old
horace
any
doubt
exclaimed
davis
any
doubt
almost
shrieked
the
rest
why
there
can
be
no
doubt
why
colonel
what
are
you
thinking
of
tell
us
who
has
got
the
money
if
he
has
tell
us
where
on
earth
the
nigger
got
the
money
he
been
putting
in
the
bank
doubt
why
there
is
the
least
doubt
about
it
certainly
certainly
said
the
colonel
but
i
thought
of
course
he
might
have
saved
it
there
are
several
of
those
people
you
know
who
do
a
little
business
and
have
bank
accounts
yes
but
they
are
in
some
sort
of
business
this
man
makes
only
thirty
dollars
a
month
do
you
see
the
colonel
saw
or
said
he
did
and
he
did
not
answer
what
he
might
have
answered
that
berry
had
no
rent
and
no
board
to
pay
his
clothes
came
from
his
master
and
kitty
and
fannie
looked
to
their
mistress
for
the
larger
number
of
their
supplies
he
did
not
call
to
their
minds
that
fannie
herself
made
fifteen
dollars
a
month
and
that
for
two
years
joe
had
been
supporting
himself
these
things
did
not
come
up
and
as
far
as
the
opinion
of
the
gentlemen
assembled
in
the
continental
bar
went
berry
was
already
proven
guilty
as
for
the
prisoner
himself
after
the
first
day
when
he
had
pleaded
not
guilty
and
been
bound
over
to
the
grand
jury
he
had
fallen
into
a
sort
of
dazed
calm
that
was
like
the
stupor
produced
by
a
drug
he
took
little
heed
of
what
went
on
around
him
the
shock
had
been
too
sudden
for
him
and
it
was
as
if
his
reason
had
been
for
the
time
unseated
that
it
was
not
permanently
overthrown
was
evidenced
by
his
waking
to
the
most
acute
pain
and
grief
whenever
fannie
came
to
him
then
he
would
toss
and
moan
and
give
vent
to
his
sorrow
in
passionate
complaints
i
did
tech
his
money
fannie
you
know
i
did
i
every
cent
of
dat
money
an
i
saved
it
myself
oh
i
nevah
be
able
to
git
a
job
me
in
de
me
aftah
all
dese
yeahs
beyond
this
apparently
his
mind
could
not
go
that
his
detention
was
anything
more
than
temporary
never
seemed
to
enter
his
mind
that
he
would
be
convicted
and
sentenced
was
as
far
from
possibility
as
the
skies
from
the
earth
if
he
saw
visions
of
a
long
sojourn
in
prison
it
was
only
as
a
nightmare
half
consciously
experienced
and
which
with
the
struggle
must
give
way
before
the
waking
fannie
was
utterly
hopeless
she
had
laid
down
whatever
pride
had
been
hers
and
gone
to
plead
with
maurice
oakley
for
her
husband
freedom
and
she
had
seen
his
hard
set
face
she
had
gone
upon
her
knees
before
his
wife
to
cite
berry
long
fidelity
oh
mis
oakley
she
cried
ef
he
did
steal
de
money
we
got
enough
saved
to
mek
it
good
let
him
go
let
him
go
then
you
admit
that
he
did
steal
oakley
had
taken
her
up
sharply
oh
i
did
say
dat
i
did
mean
dat
that
will
do
fannie
i
understand
perfectly
you
should
have
confessed
that
long
ago
but
i
ai
confessin
i
ai
he
did
you
may
go
the
stricken
woman
reeled
out
of
her
mistress
presence
and
oakley
told
her
husband
that
night
with
tears
in
her
eyes
how
disappointed
she
was
with
fannie
that
the
woman
had
known
it
all
along
and
had
only
just
confessed
it
was
just
one
more
link
in
the
chain
that
was
surely
and
not
too
slowly
forging
itself
about
berry
hamilton
of
all
the
family
joe
was
the
only
one
who
burned
with
a
fierce
indignation
he
knew
that
his
father
was
innocent
and
his
very
helplessness
made
a
fever
in
his
soul
dandy
as
he
was
he
was
loyal
and
when
he
saw
his
mother
tears
and
his
sister
shame
something
rose
within
him
that
had
it
been
given
play
might
have
made
a
man
of
him
but
being
crushed
died
and
rotted
and
in
the
compost
it
made
all
the
evil
of
his
nature
flourished
the
looks
and
gibes
of
his
at
the
forced
him
to
leave
his
work
there
kit
bowed
with
shame
and
grief
dared
not
appear
upon
the
streets
where
the
girls
who
had
envied
her
now
hooted
at
her
so
the
little
family
was
shut
in
upon
itself
away
from
fellowship
and
sympathy
joe
went
seldom
to
see
his
father
he
was
not
heartless
but
the
citadel
of
his
long
desired
and
much
vaunted
manhood
trembled
before
the
sight
of
his
father
abject
misery
the
lines
came
round
his
lips
and
lines
too
must
have
come
round
his
heart
poor
fellow
he
was
too
young
for
this
forcing
process
and
in
the
of
pain
he
only
grew
an
acrid
unripe
cynic
at
the
sitting
of
the
grand
jury
berry
was
indicted
his
trial
followed
soon
and
the
town
turned
out
to
see
it
some
came
to
laugh
and
scoff
but
these
his
enemies
were
silenced
by
the
spectacle
of
his
grief
in
vain
the
lawyer
whom
he
had
secured
showed
that
the
evidence
against
him
proved
nothing
in
vain
he
produced
proof
of
the
slow
accumulation
of
what
the
man
had
in
vain
he
pleaded
the
man
former
good
name
the
judge
and
the
jury
saw
otherwise
berry
was
convicted
he
was
given
ten
years
at
hard
labour
he
hardly
looked
as
if
he
could
live
out
one
as
he
heard
his
sentence
but
nature
was
kind
and
relieved
him
of
the
strain
with
a
cry
as
if
his
heart
were
bursting
he
started
up
and
fell
forward
on
his
face
unconscious
some
one
a
bit
more
brutal
than
the
rest
said
it
five
dollars
fine
every
time
a
nigger
faints
but
no
one
laughed
there
was
something
too
portentous
too
tragic
in
the
degradation
of
this
man
maurice
oakley
sat
in
the
grim
and
relentless
as
soon
as
the
trial
was
over
he
sent
for
fannie
who
still
kept
the
cottage
in
the
yard
you
must
go
he
said
you
ca
stay
here
any
longer
i
want
none
of
your
breed
about
me
and
fannie
bowed
her
head
and
went
away
from
him
in
silence
all
the
night
long
the
women
of
the
hamilton
household
lay
in
bed
and
wept
clinging
to
each
other
in
their
grief
but
joe
did
not
go
to
sleep
against
all
their
entreaties
he
stayed
up
he
put
out
the
light
and
sat
staring
into
the
gloom
with
hard
burning
eyes
vi
outcasts
what
particularly
irritated
maurice
oakley
was
that
berry
should
to
the
very
last
keep
up
his
claim
of
innocence
he
reiterated
it
to
the
very
moment
that
the
train
which
was
bearing
him
away
pulled
out
of
the
station
there
had
seldom
been
seen
such
an
example
of
criminal
hardihood
and
oakley
was
hardened
thereby
to
greater
severity
in
dealing
with
the
convict
wife
he
began
to
urge
her
more
strongly
to
move
and
she
dispirited
and
humiliated
by
what
had
come
to
her
looked
vainly
about
for
the
way
to
satisfy
his
demands
with
her
natural
protector
gone
she
felt
more
weak
and
helpless
than
she
had
thought
it
possible
to
feel
it
was
hard
enough
to
face
the
world
but
to
have
to
ask
something
of
it
was
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
with
the
conviction
of
her
husband
the
last
five
hundred
dollars
had
been
confiscated
as
belonging
to
the
stolen
money
but
their
former
deposit
remained
untouched
with
this
she
had
the
means
at
her
disposal
to
tide
over
their
present
days
of
misfortune
it
was
not
money
she
lacked
but
confidence
some
inkling
of
the
world
attitude
towards
her
guiltless
though
she
was
reached
her
and
made
her
afraid
her
desperation
however
would
not
let
her
give
way
to
fear
so
she
set
forth
to
look
for
another
house
joe
and
kit
saw
her
go
as
if
she
were
starting
on
an
expedition
into
a
strange
country
in
all
their
lives
they
had
known
no
home
save
the
little
cottage
in
oakley
yard
here
they
had
toddled
as
babies
and
played
as
children
and
been
happy
and
there
had
been
times
when
they
had
complained
and
wanted
a
home
off
by
themselves
like
others
whom
they
knew
they
had
not
failed
either
to
draw
unpleasant
comparisons
between
their
mode
of
life
and
the
old
plantation
quarters
system
but
now
all
this
was
forgotten
and
there
were
only
grief
and
anxiety
that
they
must
leave
the
place
and
in
such
a
way
fannie
went
out
with
little
hope
in
her
heart
and
a
short
while
after
she
was
gone
joe
decided
to
follow
her
and
make
an
attempt
to
get
work
i
go
an
see
what
i
kin
do
anyway
kit
ai
much
use
i
reckon
trying
to
get
into
a
bahbah
shop
where
they
shave
white
folks
because
all
the
white
folks
are
down
on
us
i
try
one
of
the
coloured
shops
this
was
something
of
a
condescension
for
berry
hamilton
son
he
had
never
yet
shaved
a
black
chin
or
put
shears
to
what
he
termed
naps
and
he
was
proud
of
it
he
thought
though
that
after
the
training
he
had
received
from
the
superior
tonsorial
parlours
where
he
had
been
employed
he
had
but
to
ask
for
a
place
and
he
would
be
gladly
accepted
it
is
strange
how
all
the
foolish
little
vaunting
things
that
a
man
says
in
days
of
prosperity
wax
a
giant
crop
around
him
in
the
days
of
his
adversity
berry
hamilton
son
found
this
out
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
applied
at
the
first
of
the
coloured
shops
for
work
oh
no
suh
said
the
proprietor
i
do
think
we
got
anything
you
to
do
you
a
white
man
bahbah
we
do
shave
nothin
but
niggahs
hyeah

thoo
a
niggah
naps
you
ai
been
practisin
lately
has
you
came
from
the
back
of
the
shop
where
a
grinning
negro
was
scraping
a
fellow
face
oh
yes
you
done
with
are
you
but
are
good
enough
fu
you
now
i
think
the
proprietor
resumed
that
i
hyeahed
you
say
you
was
fond
o
grape
pickin
well
josy
my
son
i
would
begin
it
now
as
anothah
kin
o
pickin
seems
to
run
in
yo
fambly
joe
hamilton
never
knew
how
he
got
out
of
that
shop
he
only
knew
that
he
found
himself
upon
the
street
outside
the
door
tears
of
anger
and
shame
in
his
eyes
and
the
laughs
and
taunts
of
his
tormentors
still
ringing
in
his
ears
it
was
cruel
of
course
it
was
cruel
it
was
brutal
but
only
he
knew
how
just
it
had
been
in
his
moments
of
pride
he
had
said
all
those
things
half
in
fun
and
half
in
earnest
and
he
began
to
wonder
how
he
could
have
been
so
many
kinds
of
a
fool
for
so
long
without
realising
it
he
had
not
the
heart
to
seek
another
shop
for
he
knew
that
what
would
be
known
at
one
would
be
equally
well
known
at
all
the
rest
the
hardest
thing
that
he
had
to
bear
was
the
knowledge
that
he
had
shut
himself
out
of
all
the
chances
that
he
now
desired
he
remembered
with
a
pang
the
words
of
an
old
negro
to
whom
he
had
once
been
impudent
nevah
min
boy
nevah
min
you
but
you
ai
daid
it
was
too
true
he
had
not
known
then
what
would
come
he
had
never
dreamed
that
anything
so
terrible
could
overtake
him
even
in
his
straits
however
desperation
gave
him
a
certain
pluck
he
would
try
for
something
else
for
which
his
own
tongue
had
not
disqualified
him
with
joe
to
think
was
to
do
he
went
on
to
the
continental
hotel
where
there
were
almost
always
boys
wanted
to
run
the
bells
the
clerk
looked
him
over
critically
he
was
a
bright
young
fellow
and
the
man
liked
his
looks
well
i
guess
we
can
take
you
on
he
said
what
your
name
joe
was
the
laconic
answer
he
was
afraid
to
say
more
well
joe
you
go
over
there
and
sit
where
you
see
those
fellows
in
uniform
and
wait
until
i
call
the
head
bellman
young
hamilton
went
over
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
which
ran
along
the
hotel
corridor
and
where
the
bellmen
were
wont
to
stay
during
the
day
awaiting
their
calls
a
few
of
the
mercuries
were
there
upon
joe
advent
they
began
to
look
askance
at
him
and
to
talk
among
themselves
he
felt
his
face
burning
as
he
thought
of
what
they
must
be
saying
then
he
saw
the
head
bellman
talking
to
the
clerk
and
looking
in
his
direction
he
saw
him
shake
his
head
and
walk
away
he
could
have
cursed
him
the
clerk
called
to
him
i
did
know
he
said
i
did
know
that
you
were
berry
hamilton
boy
now
i
got
nothing
against
you
myself
i
do
hold
you
responsible
for
what
your
father
did
but
i
do
believe
our
boys
would
work
with
you
i
ca
take
you
on
joe
turned
away
to
meet
the
grinning
or
contemptuous
glances
of
the
bellmen
on
the
seat
it
would
have
been
good
to
be
able
to
hurl
something
among
them
but
he
was
helpless
he
hastened
out
of
the
hotel
feeling
that
every
eye
was
upon
him
every
finger
pointing
at
him
every
tongue
whispering
there
goes
joe
hamilton
whose
father
went
to
the
penitentiary
the
other
day
what
should
he
do
he
could
try
no
more
he
was
proscribed
and
the
letters
of
his
ban
were
writ
large
throughout
the
town
where
all
who
ran
might
read
for
a
while
he
wandered
aimlessly
about
and
then
turned
dejectedly
homeward
his
mother
had
not
yet
come
did
you
get
a
job
was
kit
first
question
no
he
answered
bitterly
no
one
wants
me
now
no
one
wants
you
why
joe
they
they
do
think
hard
of
us
do
they
i
do
know
what
they
think
of
ma
and
you
but
they
think
hard
of
me

right
oh
do
you
worry

all
right
when
it
blows
over
yes
when
it
all
blows
over
but
when
that
be
oh
after
a
while
when
we
can
show
we
all
right
some
of
the
girl
cheery
hopefulness
had
come
back
to
her
in
the
presence
of
her
brother
dejection
as
a
woman
always
forgets
her
own
sorrow
when
some
one
she
loves
is
grieving
but
she
could
not
communicate
any
of
her
feeling
to
joe
who
had
been
and
seen
and
felt
and
now
sat
darkly
waiting
his
mother
return
some
presentiment
seemed
to
tell
him
that
armed
as
she
was
with
money
to
pay
for
what
she
wanted
and
asking
for
nothing
without
price
she
would
yet
have
no
better
tale
to
tell
than
he
none
of
these
forebodings
visited
the
mind
of
kit
and
as
soon
as
her
mother
appeared
on
the
threshold
she
ran
to
her
crying
oh
where
are
we
going
to
live
ma
fannie
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
answered
with
a
burst
of
tears
gawd
knows
child
gawd
knows
the
girl
stepped
back
astonished
why
why
and
then
with
a
rush
of
tenderness
she
threw
her
arms
about
her
mother
neck
oh
you
tired
to
death
she
said
that
what
the
matter
with
you
never
mind
about
the
house
now
i
got
some
tea
made
for
you
and
you
just
take
a
cup
fannie
sat
down
and
tried
to
drink
her
tea
but
she
could
not
it
stuck
in
her
throat
and
the
tears
rolled
down
her
face
and
fell
into
the
shaking
cup
joe
looked
on
silently
he
had
been
out
and
he
understood
i
go
out
and
do
some
looking
around
for
a
house
while
you
stay
at
home
an
rest
ma
her
mother
looked
up
the
maternal
instinct
for
the
protection
of
her
daughter
at
once
aroused
oh

she
said
then
for
the
first
time
joe

nervously
before

almost
more
than
she
could
understand
why
we
ai
done
anything
she

in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
a
knock
came
at
the
door
it
was
a
messenger
from
the
house
as
they
still
called
oakley
home
and
he
wanted
them
to
be
out
of
the
cottage
by
the
next
afternoon
as
the
new
servants
were
coming
and
would
want
the
rooms
the
message
was
so
curt
so
hard
and
decisive
that
fannie
was
startled
out
of
her
grief
into
immediate
action
well
we
got
to
go
she
said
rising
wearily
but
where

we

in
affright
there

to
we
have
got
a
house
where
we

someplace
as
fur
away
from
this
damned
hole
as
we
kin
git
the
boy
spoke
recklessly
in
his
anger
he
had
never
sworn
before
his
mother
before
she
looked
at
him
in
horror
joe
joe
she
said

to
baih
when
you
talk
dat
what
you
mean
whaih
you
think
gawd
is
joe
remained
sullenly
silent
his
mother
faith
was
too
stalwart
for
his
comprehension
there
was
nothing
like
it
in
his
own
soul
to
interpret
it
we
git
de
dealah
to
tek
ouah
things
an
then
we
go
away
some
place
up
maybe
let
go
to
new
york
said
joe
new
they
had
heard
of
new
york
as
a
place
vague
and
far
away
a
city
that
like
heaven
to
them
had
existed
by
faith
alone
all
the
days
of
their
lives
they
had
heard
of
it
and
it
seemed
to
them
the
centre
of
all
the
glory
all
the
wealth
and
all
the
freedom
of
the
world
new
york
it
had
an
alluring
sound
who
would
know
them
there
who
would
look
down
upon
them
it
a
mighty
long
ways
off
fu
me
to
be
at
dis
time
life
we
want
to
go
a
long
ways
off
i
wonder
what
pa
would
think
of
it
if
he
was
here
put
in
kitty
i
guess
he
think
we
was
doin
the
best
we
could
well
den
joe
said
his
mother
her
voice
trembling
with
emotion
at
the
daring
step
they
were
about
to
take
you
set
down
an
write
a
lettah
to
yo
pa
an
tell
him
what
we
goin
to
do
we
something
akin
to
joy
came
into
the
boy
heart
as
he
sat
down
to
write
the
letter
they
had
taunted
him
had
they
they
had
scoffed
at
him
but
he
was
going
where
they
might
never
go
and
some
day
he
would
come
back
holding
his
head
high
and
pay
them
sneer
for
sneer
and
jibe
for
jibe
the
same
night
the
commission
was
given
to
the
furniture
dealer
who
would
take
charge
of
their
things
and
sell
them
when
and
for
what
he
could
from
his
window
the
next
morning
maurice
oakley
watched
the
wagon
emptying
the
house
then
he
saw
fannie
come
out
and
walk
about
her
little
garden
followed
by
her
children
he
saw
her
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
led
the
way
to
the
side
gate
well
they
gone
he
said
to
his
wife
i
wonder
where
they
going
to
live
oh
some
of
their
people
will
take
them
in
replied
oakley
languidly
despite
the
fact
that
his
mother
carried
with
her
the
rest
of
the
money
drawn
from
the
bank
joe
had
suddenly
stepped
into
the
place
of
the
man
of
the
family
he
attended
to
all
the
details
of
their
getting
away
with
a
promptness
that
made
it
seem
untrue
that
he
had
never
been
more
than
thirty
miles
from
his
native
town
he
was
eager
and
excited
as
the
train
drew
out
of
the
station
he
did
not
look
back
upon
the
place
which
he
hated
but
fannie
and
her
daughter
let
their
eyes
linger
upon
it
until
the
last
house
the
last
chimney
and
the
last
spire
faded
from
their
sight
and
their
tears
fell
and
mingled
as
they
were
whirled
away
toward
the
unknown
vii
in
new
york
to
the
provincial
coming
to
new
york
for
the
first
time
ignorant
and
unknown
the
city
presents
a
notable
mingling
of
the
qualities
of
cheeriness
and
gloom
if
he
have
any
eye
at
all
for
the
beautiful
he
can
not
help
experiencing
a
thrill
as
he
crosses
the
ferry
over
the
river
filled
with
plying
craft
and
catches
the
first
sight
of
the
spires
and
buildings
of
new
york
if
he
have
the
right
stuff
in
him
a
something
will
take
possession
of
him
that
will
grip
him
again
every
time
he
returns
to
the
scene
and
will
make
him
long
and
hunger
for
the
place
when
he
is
away
from
it
later
the
lights
in
the
busy
streets
will
bewilder
and
entice
him
he
will
feel
shy
and
helpless
amid
the
hurrying
crowds
a
new
emotion
will
take
his
heart
as
the
people
hasten
by
him
a
feeling
of
loneliness
almost
of
grief
that
with
all
of
these
souls
about
him
he
knows
not
one
and
not
one
of
them
cares
for
him
after
a
while
he
will
find
a
place
and
give
a
sigh
of
relief
as
he
settles
away
from
the
city
sights
behind
his
cosey
blinds
it
is
better
here
and
the
city
is
cruel
and
cold
and
unfeeling
this
he
will
feel
perhaps
for
the
first
and
then
he
will
be
out
in
it
all
again
he
will
be
glad
to
strike
elbows
with
the
bustling
mob
and
be
happy
at
their
indifference
to
him
so
that
he
may
look
at
them
and
study
them
after
it
is
all
over
after
he
has
passed
through
the
first
pangs
of
strangeness
and
homesickness
yes
even
after
he
has
got
beyond
the
stranger
enthusiasm
for
the
metropolis
the
real
fever
of
love
for
the
place
will
begin
to
take
hold
upon
him
the
subtle
insidious
wine
of
new
york
will
begin
to
intoxicate
him
then
if
he
be
wise
he
will
go
away
any
place
yes
he
will
even
go
over
to
jersey
but
if
he
be
a
fool
he
will
stay
and
stay
on
until
the
town
becomes
all
in
all
to
him
until
the
very
streets
are
his
chums
and
certain
buildings
and
corners
his
best
friends
then
he
is
hopeless
and
to
live
elsewhere
would
be
death
the
bowery
will
be
his
romance
broadway
his
lyric
and
the
park
his
pastoral
the
river
and
the
glory
of
it
all
his
epic
and
he
will
look
down
pityingly
on
all
the
rest
of
humanity
it
was
the
afternoon
of
a
clear
october
day
that
the
hamiltons
reached
new
york
fannie
had
some
misgivings
about
crossing
the
ferry
but
once
on
the
boat
these
gave
way
to
speculations
as
to
what
they
should
find
on
the
other
side
with
the
eagerness
of
youth
to
take
in
new
impressions
joe
and
kitty
were
more
concerned
with
what
they
saw
about
them
than
with
what
their
future
would
hold
though
they
might
well
have
stopped
to
ask
some
such
questions
in
all
the
great
city
they
knew
absolutely
no
one
and
had
no
idea
which
way
to
go
to
find
a
they
looked
about
them
for
some
coloured
face
and
finally
saw
one
among
the
porters
who
were
handling
the
baggage
to
joe
inquiry
he
gave
them
an
address
and
also
proffered
his
advice
as
to
the
best
way
to
reach
the
place
he
was
exceedingly
polite
and
he
looked
hard
at
kitty
they
found
the
house
to
which
they
had
been
directed
and
were
a
good
deal
surprised
at
its
apparent
grandeur
it
was
a
brick
dwelling
on
street
as
they
looked
from
the
outside
they
were
afraid
that
the
price
of
staying
in
such
a
place
would
be
too
much
for
their
pockets
inside
the
sight
of
the
hard
gaudily
upholstered
furniture
did
not
disillusion
them
and
they
continued
to
fear
that
they
could
never
stop
at
this
fine
place
but
they
found
jones
the
proprietress
both
gracious
and
willing
to
come
to
terms
with
them
as
hamilton
she
began
to
be
hamilton
now
to
the
exclusion
of
fannie
would
have
described
jones
she
was
a
big
yellow
woman
she
had
a
broad
face
and
a
tendency
to
run
to
bust
yes
she
said
i
think
i
could
arrange
to
take
you
i
could
let
you
have
two
rooms
and
you
could
use
my
kitchen
until
you
decided
whether
you
wanted
to
take
a
flat
or
not
i
has
the
whole
house
myself
and
i
keeps
roomers
but
latah
on
i
could
fix
things
so
you
could
have
the
whole
third
floor
ef
you
wanted
to
most
o
my
railroad
they
is
i
guess
it
must
been
thomas
that
sent
you
up
here
he
was
a
little
bright
man
down
at
de
deepo
yes
that
him
that
thomas
he
always
lookin
out
to
send
some
one
here
because
he
been
here
three
years
hisself
an
he
kin
recommend
my
house
it
was
a
relief
to
the
hamiltons
to
find
jones
so
gracious
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
and
they
took
up
their
abode
with
her
and
sent
for
their
baggage
with
the
first
pause
in
the
rush
that
they
had
experienced
since
starting
away
from
home
hamilton
began
to
have
time
for
reflection
and
their
condition
seemed
to
her
much
better
as
it
was
of
course
it
was
hard
to
be
away
from
home
and
among
strangers
but
the
arrangement
had
this
advantage
that
no
one
knew
them
or
could
taunt
them
with
their
past
trouble
she
was
not
sure
that
she
was
going
to
like
new
york
it
had
a
great
name
and
was
really
a
great
place
but
the
very
bigness
of
it
frightened
her
and
made
her
feel
alone
for
she
knew
that
there
could
not
be
so
many
people
together
without
a
deal
of
wickedness
she
did
not
argue
the
complement
of
this
that
the
amount
of
good
would
also
be
increased
but
this
was
because
to
her
evil
was
the
very
present
factor
in
her
life
joe
and
kit
were
differently
affected
by
what
they
saw
about
them
the
boy
was
wild
with
enthusiasm
and
with
a
desire
to
be
a
part
of
all
that
the
metropolis
meant
in
the
evening
he
saw
the
young
fellows
passing
by
dressed
in
their
spruce
clothes
and
he
wondered
with
a
sort
of
envy
where
they
could
be
going
back
home
there
had
been
no
place
much
worth
going
to
except
church
and
one
or
two
people
houses
but
these
young
fellows
seemed
to
show
by
their
manners
that
they
were
neither
going
to
church
nor
a
family
visiting
in
the
moment
that
he
recognised
this
a
revelation
came
to
him
the
knowledge
that
his
horizon
had
been
very
narrow
and
he
felt
angry
that
it
was
so
why
should
those
fellows
be
different
from
him
why
should
they
walk
the
streets
so
knowingly
so
independently
when
he
knew
not
whither
to
turn
his
steps
well
he
was
in
new
york
and
now
he
would
learn
some
day
some
greenhorn
from
the
south
should
stand
at
a
window
and
look
out
envying
him
as
he
passed
intent
on
some
goal
was
it
not
better
after
all
that
circumstances
had
forced
them
thither
had
it
not
been
so
they
might
all
have
stayed
home
and
stagnated
well
thought
he
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
and
somehow
with
a
guilty
he
forgot
to
feel
the
natural
pity
for
his
father
toiling
guiltless
in
the
prison
of
his
native
state
whom
the
gods
wish
to
destroy
they
first
make
mad
the
first
sign
of
the
demoralisation
of
the
provincial
who
comes
to
new
york
is
his
pride
at
his
insensibility
to
certain
impressions
which
used
to
influence
him
at
home
first
he
begins
to
scoff
and
there
is
no
truth
in
his
views
nor
depth
in
his
laugh
but
by
and
by
from
mere
pretending
it
becomes
real
he
grows
callous
after
that
he
goes
to
the
devil
very
cheerfully
no
such
radical
emotions
however
troubled
kit
mind
she
too
stood
at
the
windows
and
looked
down
into
the
street
there
was
a
sort
of
complacent
calm
in
the
manner
in
which
she
viewed
the
girls
hats
and
dresses
many
of
them
were
really
pretty
she
told
herself
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
not
better
than
what
she
had
had
down
home
there
was
a
sound
quality
in
the
girl
that
helped
her
to
see
through
the
glamour
of
mere
place
and
recognise
worth
for
itself
or
it
may
have
been
the
critical
faculty
which
is
prominent
in
most
women
that
kept
her
from
thinking
a
any
better
in
new
york
than
it
was
at
home
she
had
a
certain
which
made
her
value
herself
and
her
own
traditions
higher
than
her
brother
did
his
when
later
in
the
evening
the
porter
who
had
been
kind
to
them
came
in
and
was
introduced
as
william
thomas
young
as
she
was
she
took
his
open
admiration
for
her
with
more
coolness
than
joe
exhibited
when
thomas
offered
to
show
him
something
of
the
town
some
day
or
night
thomas
was
a
loquacious
little
man
with
a
confident
air
born
of
an
intense
admiration
of
himself
he
was
the
idol
of
a
number
of
hearts
and
altogether
a
decidedly
dashing
don
juan
i
tell
you
miss
kitty
he
burst
forth
a
few
minutes
after
being
introduced
they

said
joe
wisely
in
what
he
thought
was
going
to
be
quite
a
manner
but
he
burned
with
shame
the
next
minute
because
his
voice
sounded
so
weak
and
youthful
then
too
the
oracle
only
said
yes
to
him
and
went
on
expatiating
to
kitty
on
the
glories
of
the
metropolis
see
the
statue
o
liberty

in

thomas
took
the
pail
and
went
to
the
corner
as
he
left
the
room
jones
slapped
her
knee
and
laughed
until
her
bust
shook
like
jelly
thomas

a
case
sho
she
said
but
he
likes

an
i
mighty
glad
of

he
mighty
curious
about
the
house
when
he
do
like
the
roomers
joe
felt
distinctly
flattered
for
he
found
their
new
acquaintance
charming
his
mother
was
still
a
little
doubtful
and
kitty
was
sure
she
found
the
young
man
fresh
he
came
in
pretty
soon
with
his

jones
brought

the
glasses
and
the
young
man
filled
one
and
turned

kitty

said
with
a
surprised
look

joe

as

aghast

thomas
as

glass
and
handed

to
joe

said
the
boy
with
an
air
but
not
looking
at
his
mother
joe
she
cried
to
him
you
must
ricollect
you
ai
at
home
what
yo
pa

then
she
stopped
suddenly
and
joe
gulped
his
beer
and
kitty
went
to
the
piano
to
relieve
her
embarrassment

huntin

you
die
laughing
hamilton
made
no
further
demur
and
the
matter
was
closed
awhile
later
the
man
came
down
and
gave
them
a
sample
of
what
they
were
to
hear
the
next
night
thomas
and
jones
and
they
sent
a
boy
after
some
more
beer
joe
found
it
a
very
jolly
evening
but
kit
and
the
mother
hearts
were
heavy
as
they
went
up
to
bed
say
said
thomas
when
they
had
gone
that
little
girl
a
peach
you
bet
a
little
green
i
guess
but
she
ripen
in
the
sun
viii
an
evening
out
fannie
hamilton
tired
as
she
was
sat
long
into
the
night
with
her
little
family
discussing
new
york
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
its
beauty
and
its
ugliness
its
morality
and
immorality
she
had
somewhat
receded
from
her
first
position
that
it
was
better
being
here
in
the
great
strange
city
than
being
at
home
where
the
very
streets
shamed
them
she
had
not
liked
the
way
that
their
fellow
lodger
looked
at
kitty
it
was
bold
to
say
the
least
she
was
not
pleased
either
with
their
new
acquaintance
familiarity
and
yet
he
had
said
no
more
than
some
stranger
if
there
could
be
such
a
stranger
would
have
said
down
home
there
was
a
difference
however
which
she
recognised
thomas
was
not
the
provincial
who
puts
every
one
on
a
par
with
himself
nor
was
he
the
metropolitan
who
complacently
patronises
the
whole
world
he
was
trained
out
of
the
one
and
not
up
to
the
other
the
intermediate
only
succeeded
in
being
offensive
jones
assurance
as
to
her
fine
qualities
did
not
do
all
that
might
have
been
expected
to
reassure
hamilton
in
the
face
of
the
difficulties
of
the
gentleman
manner
she
could
not
however
lay
her
finger
on
any
particular
point
that
would
give
her
the
reason
for
rejecting
his
friendly
advances
she
got
ready
the
next
evening
to
go
to
the
theatre
with
the
rest
thomas
at
once
possessed
himself
of
kitty
and
walked
on
ahead
leaving
joe
to
accompany
his
mother
and
jones
an
arrangement
by
the
way
not
altogether
to
that
young
gentleman
taste
a
good
many
men
bowed
to
thomas
in
the
street
and
they
turned
to
look
enviously
after
him
at
the
door
of
the
theatre
they
had
to
run
the
gantlet
of
a
dozen
pairs
of
eyes
here
too
the
party
guide
seemed
to
be
well
known
for
some
one
said
before
they
passed
out
of
hearing
i
wonder
who
that
little
light
girl
is
that
thomas
is
with
he
a
hot
one
for
you
hamilton
had
been
in
a
theatre
but
once
before
in
her
life
and
joe
and
kit
but
a
few
times
oftener
on
those
occasions
they
had
sat
far
up
in
the
peanut
gallery
in
the
place
reserved
for
people
of
colour
this
was
not
a
pleasant
cleanly
nor
beautiful
locality
and
by
contrast
with
it
even
the
garishness
of
the
cheap
new
york
theatre
seemed
fine
and
glorious
they
had
good
seats
in
the
first
balcony
and
here
their
guide
had
shown
his
managerial
ability
again
for
he
had
found
it
impossible
or
said
so
to
get
all
the
seats
together
so
that
he
and
the
girl
were
in
the
row
in
front
and
to
one
side
of
where
the
rest
sat
kitty
did
not
like
the
arrangement
and
innocently
suggested
that
her
brother
take
her
seat
while
she
went
back
to
her
mother
but
her
escort
overruled
her
objections
easily
and
laughed
at
her
so
frankly
that
from
very
shame
she
could
not
urge
them
again
and
they
were
soon
forgotten
in
her
wonder
at
the
mystery
and
glamour
that
envelops
the
home
of
the
drama
there
was
something
weird
to
her
in
the
alternate
spaces
of
light
and
shade
without
any
feeling
of
its
ugliness
she
looked
at
the
curtain
as
at
a
door
that
should
presently
open
between
her
and
a
house
of
wonders
she
looked
at
it
with
the
fascination
that
one
always
experiences
for
what
either
brings
near
or
withholds
the
unknown
as
for
joe
he
was
not
bothered
by
the
mystery
or
the
glamour
of
things
but
he
had
suddenly
raised
himself
in
his
own
estimation
he
had
gazed
steadily
at
a
girl
across
the
aisle
until
she
had
smiled
in
response
of
course
he
went
hot
and
cold
by
turns
and
the
sweat
broke
out
on
his
brow
but
instantly
he
began
to
swell
he
had
made
a
decided
advance
in
knowledge
and
he
swelled
with
the
consciousness
that
already
he
was
coming
to
be
a
man
of
the
world
he
looked
with
a
new
feeling
at
the
swaggering
sporty
young
negroes
his
attitude
towards
them
was
not
one
of
humble
any
more
since
last
night
he
had
grown
and
felt
that
he
might
that
he
would
be
like
them
and
it
put
a
sort
of
chuckling
glee
into
his
heart
one
might
find
it
in
him
to
feel
sorry
for
this
warped
being
for
he
was
so
evidently
the
jest
of
fate
if
it
were
not
that
he
was
so
blissfully
so
conceitedly
unconscious
of
his
own
nastiness
down
home
he
had
shaved
the
wild
young
bucks
of
the
town
and
while
doing
it
drunk
in
eagerly
their
unguarded
narrations
of
their
gay
exploits
so
he
had
started
out
with
false
ideals
as
to
what
was
fine
and
manly
he
was
afflicted
by
a
sort
of
moral
and
mental
astigmatism
that
made
him
see
everything
wrong
as
he
sat
there
he
gave
to
all
he
saw
a
wrong
value
and
upon
it
based
his
ignorant
desires
when
the
men
of
the
orchestra
filed
in
and
began
tuning
their
instruments
it
was
the
signal
for
an
influx
of
loiterers
from
the
door
there
were
a
large
number
of
coloured
people
in
the
audience
and
because
members
of
their
own
race
were
giving
the
performance
they
seemed
to
take
a
proprietary
interest
in
it
all
they
discussed
its
merits
and
demerits
as
they
walked
down
the
aisle
in
much
the
same
tone
that
the
owners
would
have
used
had
they
been
wondering
whether
the
entertainment
was
going
to
please
the
people
or
not
finally
the
music
struck
up
one
of
the
numerous
negro
marches
it
was
accompanied
by
the
rhythmic
patting
of
feet
from
all
parts
of
the
house
then
the
curtain
went
up
on
a
scene
of
beauty
it
purported
to
be
a
grove
to
which
a
party
of
picnickers
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
chorus
had
come
for
a
holiday
and
they
were
telling
the
audience
all
about
it
in
crescendos
with
the
exception
of
one
who
looked
like
a
faded
kid
glove
the
men
discarded
the
grease
paint
but
the
women
under
their
ranged
from
pure
white
pale
yellow
and
sickly
greens
to
brick
reds
and
slate
grays
they
were
dressed
in
costumes
that
were
not
primarily
intended
for
picnic
going
but
they
could
sing
and
they
did
sing
with
their
voices
their
bodies
their
souls
they
threw
themselves
into
it
because
they
enjoyed
and
felt
what
they
were
doing
and
they
gave
almost
a
semblance
of
dignity
to
the
tawdry
music
and
inane
words
kitty
was
enchanted
the
airily
dressed
women
seemed
to
her
like
creatures
from
it
is
strange
how
the
glare
of
the
footlights
succeeds
in
deceiving
so
many
people
who
are
able
to
see
through
other
delusions
the
cheap
dresses
on
the
street
had
not
fooled
kitty
for
an
instant
but
take
the
same
put
a
little
water
starch
into
it
and
put
it
on
the
stage
and
she
could
see
only
chiffon
she
turned
around
and
nodded
delightedly
at
her
brother
but
he
did
not
see
her
he
was
lost
transfixed
his
soul
was
floating
on
a
sea
of
sense
he
had
eyes
and
ears
and
thoughts
only
for
the
stage
his
nerves
tingled
and
his
hands
twitched
only
to
know
one
of
those
radiant
creatures
to
have
her
speak
to
him
smile
at
him
if
ever
a
man
was
intoxicated
joe
was
hamilton
was
divided
between
shame
at
the
clothes
of
some
of
the
women
and
delight
with
the
music
her
companion
was
busy
pointing
out
who
this
and
that
actress
was
and
giving
appreciation
to
the
doings
on
the
stage
thomas
was
the
only
cool
one
in
the
party
he
was
quietly
taking
stock
of
his
young
companion
of
her
innocence
and
charm
she
was
a
pretty
girl
little
and
dainty
but
well
developed
for
her
age
her
hair
was
very
black
and
wavy
and
some
strain
of
the
south
chivalric
blood
which
is
so
curiously
mingled
with
the
african
in
the
veins
of
most
coloured
people
had
tinged
her
skin
to
an
olive
hue
are
you
enjoying
yourself
he
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
her
his
voice
was
very
confidential
and
his
lips
near
her
ear
but
she
did
not
notice
oh
yes
she
answered
this
is
grand
how
i
like
to
be
an
actress
and
be
up
there
maybe
you
will
some
day
oh
no
i
not
smart
enough
we
see
he
said
wisely
i
know
a
thing
or
two
between
the
first
and
second
acts
a
number
of
thomas
friends
strolled
up
to
where
he
sat
and
began
talking
and
again
kitty
embarrassment
took
possession
of
her
as
they
were
introduced
one
by
one
they
treated
her
with
a
familiarity
that
made
her
blush
her
mother
was
not
pleased
with
the
many
acquaintances
that
her
daughter
was
making
and
would
have
interfered
had
not
jones
assured
her
that
the
men
clustered
about
their
host
seat
were
some
of
the
best
people
in
town
joe
looked
at
them
hungrily
but
the
man
in
front
with
his
sister
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
include
the
brother
or
the
rest
of
the
party
in
his
miscellaneous
introductions
one
brief
bit
of
conversation
which
the
mother
overheard
especially
troubled
her
not
going
out
for
a
minute
or
two
asked
one
of
the
men
as
he
was
turning
away
from
thomas
no
i
do
think
i
go
out
you
can
have
my
share
the
fellow
gave
a
horse
laugh
and
replied
well
you
doing
a
great
piece
of
work
miss
hamilton
whenever
you
can
keep
old
bill
from
out
an
lushin
between
acts
say
you
got
a
good
thing
push
it
along
the
girl
mother
half
rose
but
she
resumed
her
seat
for
the
man
was
going
away
her
mind
was
not
quiet
again
however
until
the
people
were
all
in
their
seats
and
the
curtain
had
gone
up
on
the
second
act
at
first
she
was
surprised
at
the
enthusiasm
over
just
such
dancing
as
she
could
see
any
day
from
the
loafers
on
the
street
corners
down
home
and
then
like
a
good
sensible
humble
woman
she
came
around
to
the
idea
that
it
was
she
who
had
always
been
wrong
in
putting
too
low
a
value
on
really
worthy
things
so
she
laughed
and
applauded
with
the
rest
all
the
while
trying
to
quiet
something
that
was
tugging
at
her
away
down
in
her
heart
when
the
performance
was
over
she
forced
her
way
to
kitty
side
where
she
remained
in
spite
of
all
thomas
palpable
efforts
to
get
her
away
finally
he
proposed
that
they
all
go
to
supper
at
one
of
the
coloured
cafes
you
see
a
lot
o
the
show
people
he
said
no
i
reckon
we
bettah
go
home
said
hamilton
decidedly
de
chillen
ai
ust
to
stayin
up
all
hours
o
nights
an
i
ai
anxious
fu
to
git
ust
to
it
she
was
conscious
of
a
growing
dislike
for
this
man
who
treated
her
daughter
with
such
a
proprietary
air
joe
winced
again
at
de
chillen
thomas
bit
his
lip
and
mentally
said
things
that
are
unfit
for
publication
aloud
he
said
mebbe
miss
kitty
like
to
go
an
have
a
little
lunch
oh
no
thank
you
said
the
girl
i
had
a
nice
time
and
i
care
for
a
thing
to
eat
joe
told
himself
that
kitty
was
the
biggest
fool
that
it
had
ever
been
his
lot
to
meet
and
the
disappointed
suitor
satisfied
himself
with
the
reflection
that
the
girl
was
green
yet
but
would
get
bravely
over
that
he
attempted
to
hold
her
hand
as
they
parted
at
the
parlour
door
but
she
drew
her
fingers
out
of
his
clasp
and
said
thank
you
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
her
mother
old
friends
joe
lingered
a
little
longer
say
that
was
out
o
sight
he
said
think
so
asked
the
other
carelessly
i
like
to
get
out
with
you
some
time
to
see
the
town
the
boy
went
on
eagerly
all
right
we
go
some
time
so
long
so
long
some
time
was
it
true
would
he
really
take
him
out
and
let
him
meet
stage
people
joe
went
to
bed
with
his
head
in
a
whirl
he
slept
little
that
night
for
thinking
of
his
heart
desire
ix
his
heart
desire
whatever
else
his
visit
to
the
theatre
may
have
done
for
joe
it
inspired
him
with
a
desire
to
go
to
work
and
earn
money
of
his
own
to
be
independent
both
of
parental
help
and
control
and
so
be
able
to
spend
as
he
pleased
with
this
end
in
view
he
set
out
to
hunt
for
work
it
was
a
pleasant
contrast
to
his
last
similar
quest
and
he
felt
it
with
joy
he
was
treated
everywhere
he
went
with
courtesy
even
when
no
situation
was
forthcoming
finally
he
came
upon
a
man
who
was
willing
to
try
him
for
an
afternoon
from
the
moment
the
boy
rightly
considered
himself
engaged
for
he
was
master
of
his
trade
he
began
his
work
with
heart
elate
now
he
had
within
his
grasp
the
possibility
of
being
all
that
he
wanted
to
be
now
thomas
might
take
him
out
at
any
time
and
not
be
ashamed
of
him
with
thomas
the
fact
that
joe
was
working
put
the
boy
in
an
entirely
new
light
he
decided
that
now
he
might
be
worth
cultivating
for
a
week
or
two
he
had
ignored
him
and
proceeding
upon
the
principle
that
if
you
give
corn
to
the
old
hen
she
will
cluck
to
her
chicks
had
treated
hamilton
with
marked
deference
and
kindness
this
had
been
without
success
as
both
the
girl
and
her
mother
held
themselves
politely
aloof
from
him
he
began
to
see
that
his
hope
of
winning
kitty
affections
lay
not
in
courting
the
older
woman
but
in
making
a
friend
of
the
boy
so
on
a
certain
saturday
night
when
the
banner
club
was
to
give
one
of
its
smokers
he
asked
joe
to
go
with
him
joe
was
glad
to
and
they
set
out
together
arrived
thomas
left
his
companion
for
a
few
moments
while
he
attended
as
he
said
to
a
little
business
what
he
really
did
was
to
seek
out
the
proprietor
of
the
club
and
some
of
its
hangers
on
i
say
he
said
i
got
a
friend
with
me
he
got
some
dough
on
him
he
fresh
and
young
and
easy
whew
exclaimed
the
proprietor
yes
he
a
good
thing
but
push
it
along
kin
o
light
at
first
he
might
get
skittish
thomas
let
me
fall
on
your
bosom
and
weep
said
a
young
man
who
on
account
of
his
usual
expression
of
innocent
gloom
was
called
sadness
this
is
what
i
been
looking
for
for
a
month
my
hat
was
getting
decidedly
shabby
do
you
think
he
would
stand
for
a
touch
on
the
first
night
of
our
acquaintance
do
you
dare
do
you
want
to
frighten
him
off
make
him
believe
that
you
got
coin
to
burn
and
that
it
an
honour
to
be
with
you
but
you
know
he
may
expect
a
glimpse
of
the
gold
a
smart
man
do
need
to
show
nothin
all
he
got
to
do
is
to
act
oh
i
act
we
all
act
be
slow
to
take
a
drink
from
him
thomas
my
boy
you
an
angel
i
recognise
that
more
and
more
every
day
but
bid
me
do
anything
else
but
that
that
i
refuse
it
against
nature
and
sadness
looked
more
mournful
than
ever
trust
old
sadness
to
do
his
part
said
the
portly
proprietor
and
thomas
went
back
to
the
lamb
nothin
doin
so
early
he
said
let
go
an
have
a
drink
they
went
and
thomas
ordered
no
no
this
is
on
me
cried
joe
trembling
with
joy
pshaw
your
money
counterfeit
said
his
companion
with
fine
generosity
this
is
on
me
i
say
jack
what
you
have
yourself
as
they
stood
at
the
bar
the
men
began
strolling
up
one
by
one
each
in
his
turn
was
introduced
to
joe
they
were
very
polite
they
treated
him
with
a
pale
dignified
respect
that
menaced
his
and
possessions
the
proprietor
turner
asked
him
why
he
had
never
been
in
before
he
really
seemed
much
hurt
about
it
and
on
being
told
that
joe
had
only
been
in
the
city
for
a
couple
of
weeks
expressed
emphatic
surprise
even
disbelief
and
assured
the
rest
that
any
one
would
have
taken
hamilton
for
an
old
new
yorker
sadness
was
introduced
last
he
bowed
to
joe
happy
to
know
you
mr
williams
better
known
as
sadness
he
said
with
an
expression
of
deep
gloom
a
distant
relative
of
mine
once
had
a
great
grief
i
have
never
recovered
from
it
joe
was
not
quite
sure
how
to
take
this
but
the
others
laughed
and
he
joined
them
and
then
to
cover
his
own
embarrassment
he
did
what
he
thought
the
only
correct
and
manly
thing
to
do
he
ordered
a
drink
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
said
sadness
oh
come
on
his
companions
called
out
do
be
stiff
with
a
stranger
make
him
feel
at
home
hamilton
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
have
no
intention
of
being
stiff
but
duty
is
duty
i
got
to
go
down
town
to
pay
a
bill
and
if
i
get
too
much
aboard
it
would
be
safe
walking
around
with
money
on
me
aw
shut
up
sadness
said
thomas
my
friend
hamilton
feel
hurt
if
you
do
drink
with
him
i
will
was
joe
opportune
remark
and
he
was
pleased
to
see
that
it
caused
the
reluctant
one
to
yield
they
took
a
drink
there
was
quite
a
line
of
them
joe
asked
the
bartender
what
he
would
have
the
men
warmed
towards
him
they
took
several
more
drinks
with
him
and
he
was
happy
sadness
put
his
arm
about
his
shoulder
and
told
him
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
he
looked
like
a
cousin
of
his
that
had
died
aw
shut
up
sadness
said
some
one
else
be
respectable
sadness
turned
his
mournful
eyes
upon
the
speaker
i
wo
he
replied
being
respectable
is
very
nice
as
a
diversion
but
it
tedious
if
done
steadily
joe
did
not
quite
take
this
so
he
ordered
another
drink
a
group
of
young
fellows
came
in
and
passed
up
the
stairs
shearing
another
lamb
said
one
of
them
significantly
well
with
that
gang
it
will
be
well
done
thomas
and
joe
left
the
crowd
after
a
while
and
went
to
the
upper
floor
where
in
a
long
brilliantly
lighted
room
tables
were
set
out
for
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
a
piano
and
a
man
sat
at
it
listlessly
strumming
some
popular
air
the
proprietor
joined
them
pretty
soon
and
steered
them
to
a
table
opposite
the
door
just
sit
down
here
hamilton
he
said
and
you
can
see
everybody
that
comes
in
we
have
lots
of
nice
people
here
on
smoker
nights
especially
after
the
shows
are
out
and
the
girls
come
in
joe
heart
gave
a
great
leap
and
then
settled
as
cold
as
lead
of
course
those
girls
would
speak
to
him
but
his
hopes
rose
as
the
proprietor
went
on
talking
to
him
and
to
no
one
else
turner
always
made
a
man
feel
as
if
he
were
of
some
consequence
in
the
world
and
men
a
good
deal
older
than
joe
had
been
fooled
by
his
manner
he
talked
to
one
in
a
soft
ingratiating
way
giving
his
whole
attention
apparently
he
tapped
one
confidentially
on
the
shoulder
as
who
should
say
my
dear
boy
i
have
but
two
friends
in
the
world
and
you
are
both
of
them
joe
charmed
and
pleased
kept
his
head
well
there
is
a
great
deal
in
heredity
and
his
father
had
not
been
maurice
oakley
butler
for
so
many
years
for
nothing
the
banner
club
was
an
institution
for
the
lower
education
of
negro
youth
it
drew
its
pupils
from
every
class
of
people
and
from
every
part
of
the
country
it
was
composed
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
educated
and
uneducated
dishonest
and
less
so
of
the
good
the
bad
and
the
unexposed
parasites
came
there
to
find
victims
politicians
for
votes
reporters
for
news
and
artists
of
all
kinds
for
colour
and
inspiration
it
was
the
place
of
assembly
for
a
number
of
really
bright
men
who
after
days
of
hard
and
often
unrewarded
work
came
there
and
drunk
themselves
drunk
in
each
other
company
and
when
they
were
drunk
talked
of
the
eternal
verities
the
banner
was
only
one
of
a
kind
it
stood
to
the
stranger
and
the
man
and
woman
without
connections
for
the
whole
social
life
it
was
a
substitute
poor
it
must
be
confessed
to
many
youths
for
the
home
life
which
is
so
lacking
among
certain
classes
in
new
york
here
the
rounders
congregated
or
came
and
spent
the
hours
until
it
was
time
to
go
forth
to
bout
or
assignation
here
too
came
sometimes
the
curious
who
wanted
to
see
something
of
the
other
side
of
life
among
these
white
visitors
were
not
infrequent
those
who
were
young
enough
to
be
fascinated
by
the
bizarre
and
those
who
were
old
enough
to
know
that
it
was
all
in
the
game
skaggs
of
the
new
york
was
one
of
the
former
class
and
a
constant
visitor
he
and
a
lady
friend
called
maudie
who
had
a
penchant
for
dancing
to
melodies
as
only
the
puffessor
of
such
a
club
can
play
them
of
course
the
place
was
a
social
cesspool
generating
a
poisonous
miasma
and
reeking
with
the
stench
of
decayed
and
rotten
moralities
there
is
no
defence
to
be
made
for
it
but
what
do
you
expect
when
false
idealism
and
fevered
ambition
come
face
to
face
with
catering
cupidity
it
was
into
this
atmosphere
that
thomas
had
introduced
the
boy
joe
and
he
sat
there
now
by
his
side
firing
his
mind
by
pointing
out
the
different
celebrities
who
came
in
and
telling
highly
flavoured
stories
of
their
lives
or
doings
joe
heard
things
that
had
never
come
within
the
range
of
his
mind
before
aw
there
skaggsy
an
maudie
maudie
his
girl
y
know
an
he
a
reporter
on
the
n
yawk
fine
fellow
skaggsy
maudie
a
portly
brunette
left
her
escort
and
went
directly
to
the
space
by
the
piano
here
she
was
soon
dancing
with
one
of
the
coloured
girls
who
had
come
in
skaggs
started
to
sit
down
alone
at
a
table
but
thomas
called
him
come
over
here
skaggsy
in
the
moment
that
it
took
the
young
man
to
reach
them
joe
wondered
if
he
would
ever
reach
that
state
when
he
could
call
that
white
man
skaggsy
and
the
girl
maudie
the
soon
set
all
of
that
at
ease
i
want
you
to
know
my
friend
hamilton
mr
skaggs
why
how
d
ye
do
hamilton
i
glad
to
meet
you
now
look
a
here
do
you
let
old
thomas
here
string
you
about
me
bein
any
old
skaggs
i
skaggsy
to
all
of
my
friends
i
hope
to
count
you
among
it
was
such
a
supreme
moment
that
joe
could
not
find
words
to
answer
so
he
called
for
another
drink
not
a
bit
of
it
said
skaggsy
not
a
bit
of
it
when
i
meet
my
friends
i
always
reserve
to
myself
the
right
of
ordering
the
first
drink
waiter
this
is
on
me
what
you
have
gentlemen
they
got
their
drinks
and
then
skaggsy
leaned
over
confidentially
and
began
talking
i
tell
you
hamilton
there
ai
an
ounce
of
prejudice
in
my
body
do
you
believe
it
joe
said
that
he
did
indeed
skaggsy
struck
one
as
being
aggressively
unprejudiced
he
went
on
you
see
a
lot
o
fellows
say
to
me
do
you
want
to
go
down
to
that
nigger
club
for
that
what
they
call
it
club
but
i
say
to
at
that
nigger
club
as
you
choose
to
call
it
i
get
more
inspiration
than
i
could
get
at
any
of
the
greater
clubs
in
new
york
i
often
been
invited
to
join
some
of
the
swell
clubs
here
but
i
never
do
it
by
jove
i
rather
come
down
here
and
fellowship
right
in
with
you
fellows
i
like
coloured
people
anyway
it
natural
you
see
my
father
had
a
big
plantation
and
owned
lots
of
slaves
no
offence
of
course
but
it
was
the
custom
of
that
time
and
i
played
with
little
darkies
ever
since
i
could
remember
it
was
the
same
old
story
that
the
white
who
associates
with
negroes
from
volition
usually
tells
to
explain
his
taste
the
truth
about
the
young
reporter
was
that
he
was
born
and
reared
on
a
vermont
farm
where
his
early
life
was
passed
in
fighting
for
his
very
subsistence
but
this
never
troubled
skaggsy
he
was
a
monumental
liar
and
the
saving
quality
about
him
was
that
he
calmly
believed
his
own
lies
while
he
was
telling
them
so
no
one
was
hurt
for
the
deceiver
was
as
much
a
victim
as
the
deceived
the
boys
who
knew
him
best
used
to
say
that
when
skaggs
got
started
on
one
of
his
debauches
of
lying
the
recording
angel
always
put
on
an
extra
clerical
force
now
look
at
maudie
he
went
on
would
you
believe
it
that
she
was
of
a
fine
rich
family
and
that
the
coloured
girl
she
dancing
with
now
used
to
be
her
servant
she
just
like
me
about
that
absolutely
no
prejudice
joe
was
with
wonder
and
admiration
and
he
could
understand
the
amused
expression
on
thomas
face
nor
why
he
surreptitiously
kicked
him
under
the
table
finally
the
reporter
went
his
way
and
joe
sponsor
explained
to
him
that
he
was
not
to
take
in
what
skaggsy
said
and
that
there
had
been
a
word
of
truth
in
it
he
ended
with
everybody
knows
maudie
and
that
coloured
girl
is
mamie
lacey
and
never
worked
for
anybody
in
her
life
skaggsy
a
good
fellah
all
right
but
he
the
biggest
liar
in
n
yawk
the
boy
was
distinctly
shocked
he
was
sure
but
thomas
was
jealous
of
the
attention
the
white
man
had
shown
him
and
wished
to
belittle
it
anyway
he
did
not
thank
him
for
destroying
his
romance
about
eleven
when
the
people
began
to
drop
in
from
the
plays
the
master
of
ceremonies
opened
proceedings
by
saying
that
the
free
concert
would
now
begin
and
he
hoped
that
all
present
ladies
included
would
act
like
gentlemen
and
not
forget
the
waiter
meriweather
will
now
favour
us
with
the
latest
coon
song
entitled
back
to
baby
honey
there
was
a
patter
of
applause
and
a
young
negro
came
forward
and
in
a
strident
voice
sung
or
rather
recited
with
many
gestures
the
ditty
he
could
have
been
much
older
than
joe
but
already
his
face
was
hard
with
dissipation
and
foul
knowledge
he
gave
the
song
with
all
the
rank
suggestiveness
that
could
be
put
into
it
joe
looked
upon
him
as
a
hero
he
was
followed
by
a
little
fellow
with
an
immature
vandyke
beard
and
a
lisp
he
sung
his
own
composition
and
was
funny
how
much
funnier
than
he
himself
knew
or
intended
may
not
even
be
hinted
at
then
while
an
instrumentalist
who
seemed
to
have
a
grudge
against
the
piano
was
hammering
out
the
opening
bars
of
a
march
joe
attention
was
attracted
by
a
woman
entering
the
room
and
from
that
moment
he
heard
no
more
of
the
concert
even
when
the
master
of
ceremonies
announced
with
an
air
that
by
special
request
he
himself
would
sing
answer
the
request
was
his
own
he
did
not
draw
the
attention
of
the
boy
away
from
the
divinity
who
sat
at
a
near
table
drinking
whiskey
straight
she
was
a
small
girl
with
fluffy
dark
hair
and
good
features
a
tiny
foot
peeped
out
from
beneath
her
rattling
silk
skirts
she
was
a
young
woman
and
daintily
made
though
her
face
was
no
longer
youthful
and
one
might
have
wished
that
with
her
complexion
she
had
not
run
to
silk
waists
in
magenta
joe
however
saw
no
fault
in
her
she
was
altogether
lovely
to
him
and
his
delight
was
the
more
poignant
as
he
recognised
in
her
one
of
the
girls
he
had
seen
on
the
stage
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
that
being
true
nothing
could
keep
her
from
being
glorious
in
his
eyes
not
even
the
which
adhered
in
unneat
patches
to
her
face
nor
her
taste
for
whiskey
in
its
unreformed
state
he
gazed
at
her
in
ecstasy
until
thomas
turning
to
see
what
had
attracted
him
said
with
a
laugh
oh
it
hattie
sterling
want
to
meet
her
again
the
young
fellow
was
dumb
just
then
hattie
also
noticed
his
intent
look
and
nodded
and
beckoned
to
thomas
come
on
he
said
rising
oh
she
did
ask
for
me
cried
joe
tremulous
and
eager
his
companion
went
away
laughing
who
your
young
friend
asked
hattie
a
fellah
from
the
south
bring
him
over
here
joe
could
hardly
believe
in
his
own
good
luck
and
his
head
which
was
getting
a
bit
weak
was
near
collapsing
when
his
divinity
asked
him
what
he
have
he
began
to
protest
until
she
told
the
waiter
with
an
air
of
authority
to
make
it
a
little
then
she
asked
him
for
a
cigarette
and
began
talking
to
him
in
a
pleasant
soothing
way
between
puffs
when
the
drinks
came
she
said
to
thomas
now
old
man
you
been
awfully
nice
but
when
you
get
your
little
drink
you
run
away
like
a
good
little
boy
you
superfluous
thomas
answered
well
i
like
that
but
obediently
gulped
his
whiskey
and
withdrew
while
joe
laughed
until
the
master
of
ceremonies
stood
up
and
looked
sternly
at
him
the
concert
had
long
been
over
and
the
room
was
less
crowded
when
thomas
sauntered
back
to
the
pair
well
he
said
guess
you
can
find
your
way
home
hamilton
and
he
gave
joe
a
long
wink
said
joe
woozily
i
be
a
ri
make
it
another
was
hattie
farewell
remark
it
was
late
the
next
morning
when
joe
got
home
he
had
a
headache
and
a
sense
of
triumph
that
not
even
his
illness
and
his
mother
reproof
could
subdue
he
had
promised
hattie
to
come
often
to
the
club
x
a
visitor
from
home
hamilton
began
to
question
very
seriously
whether
she
had
done
the
best
thing
in
coming
to
new
york
as
she
saw
her
son
staying
away
more
and
more
and
growing
always
farther
away
from
her
and
his
sister
had
she
known
how
and
where
he
spent
his
evenings
she
would
have
had
even
greater
cause
to
question
the
wisdom
of
their
trip
she
knew
that
although
he
worked
he
never
had
any
money
for
the
house
and
she
foresaw
the
time
when
the
little
they
had
would
no
longer
suffice
for
kitty
and
her
realising
this
she
herself
set
out
to
find
something
to
do
it
was
a
hard
matter
for
wherever
she
went
seeking
employment
it
was
always
for
her
and
her
daughter
for
the
more
she
saw
of
jones
the
less
she
thought
it
well
to
leave
the
girl
under
her
influence
hamilton
was
not
a
keen
woman
but
she
had
a
mother
intuitions
and
she
saw
a
subtle
change
in
her
daughter
at
first
the
girl
grew
wistful
and
then
impatient
and
rebellious
she
complained
that
joe
was
away
from
them
so
much
enjoying
himself
while
she
had
to
be
housed
up
like
a
prisoner
she
had
receded
from
her
dignified
position
and
twice
of
an
evening
had
gone
out
for
a
with
thomas
but
as
that
gentleman
never
included
the
mother
in
his
invitation
she
decided
that
her
daughter
should
go
no
more
and
she
begged
joe
to
take
his
sister
out
sometimes
instead
he
demurred
at
first
for
he
now
numbered
among
his
city
acquirements
a
fine
contempt
for
his
woman
relatives
finally
however
he
consented
and
took
kit
once
to
the
theatre
and
once
for
a
ride
each
time
he
left
her
in
the
care
of
thomas
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
house
while
he
went
to
find
or
to
wait
for
his
dear
hattie
but
his
mother
did
not
know
all
this
and
kit
did
not
tell
her
the
quick
poison
of
the
unreal
life
about
her
had
already
begun
to
affect
her
character
she
had
grown
secretive
and
sly
the
innocent
longing
which
in
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
she
had
expressed
that
first
night
at
the
theatre
was
growing
into
a
real
ambition
with
her
and
she
dropped
the
simple
old
songs
she
knew
to
practise
the
detestable
coon
ditties
which
the
stage
demanded
she
showed
no
particular
pleasure
when
her
mother
found
the
sort
of
place
they
wanted
but
went
to
work
with
her
in
sullen
silence
hamilton
could
not
understand
it
all
and
many
a
night
she
wept
and
prayed
over
the
change
in
this
child
of
her
heart
there
were
times
when
she
felt
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
work
or
fight
for
the
letters
from
berry
in
prison
became
fewer
and
fewer
he
was
sinking
into
the
dull
dead
routine
of
his
life
her
own
letters
to
him
fell
off
it
was
hard
getting
the
children
to
write
they
did
not
want
to
be
bothered
and
she
could
not
write
for
herself
so
in
the
weeks
and
months
that
followed
she
drifted
farther
away
from
her
children
and
husband
and
all
the
traditions
of
her
life
after
joe
first
night
at
the
banner
club
he
had
kept
his
promise
to
hattie
sterling
and
had
gone
often
to
meet
her
she
had
taught
him
much
because
it
was
to
her
advantage
to
do
so
his
greenness
had
dropped
from
him
like
a
garment
but
no
amount
of
sophistication
could
make
him
deem
the
woman
less
perfect
he
knew
that
she
was
much
older
than
he
but
he
only
took
this
fact
as
an
additional
sign
of
his
prowess
in
having
won
her
he
was
proud
of
himself
when
he
went
behind
the
scenes
at
the
theatre
or
waited
for
her
at
the
stage
door
and
bore
her
off
under
the
admiring
eyes
of
a
crowd
of
gapers
and
hattie
she
liked
him
in
a
way
he
was
a
boy
and
made
money
enough
as
she
expressed
it
to
show
her
a
good
time
so
she
was
willing
to
overlook
his
weakness
and
his
callow
vanity
look
here
she
said
to
him
one
day
i
guess
you
have
to
be
moving
there
a
young
lady
been
inquiring
for
you
and
i
stand
for
that
he
looked
at
her
startled
for
a
moment
until
he
saw
the
laughter
in
her
eyes
then
he
caught
her
and
kissed
her
what
you
givin
me
he
said
it
a
straight
tip
that
what
who
is
it
it
a
girl
named
minty
brown
from
your
home
his
face
turned
with
fear
and
shame
minty
brown
he
stammered
had
that
girl
told
all
and
undone
him
but
hattie
was
going
on
about
her
work
and
evidently
knew
nothing
oh
you
need
pretend
you
do
know
her
she
went
on
banteringly
she
says
you
were
great
friends
down
south
so
i
invited
her
to
supper
she
wants
to
see
you
to
supper
he
thought
was
she
mocking
him
was
she
restraining
her
scorn
of
him
only
to
make
his
humiliation
the
greater
after
a
while
he
looked
at
her
but
there
was
no
suspicion
of
malice
in
her
face
and
he
took
hope
well
i
like
to
see
old
minty
he
said
it
been
many
a
long
day
since
i
seen
her
all
that
afternoon
after
going
to
the
joe
was
driven
by
a
tempest
of
conflicting
emotions
if
minty
brown
had
not
told
his
story
why
not
would
she
yet
tell
and
if
she
did
what
would
happen
he
tortured
himself
by
questioning
if
hattie
would
cast
him
off
at
the
very
thought
his
hand
trembled
and
the
man
in
the
chair
asked
him
if
he
had
been
drinking
when
he
met
minty
in
the
evening
however
the
first
glance
at
her
reassured
him
her
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
as
she
came
forward
and
held
out
her
hand
well
well
joe
hamilton
she
exclaimed
if
i
ai
glad
to
see
you
how
are
you
i
middlin
minty
how
yourself
he
was
so
happy
that
he
could
let
go
her
hand
an
jes
look
at
the
boy
ef
he
ai
got
the
impidence
to
be
waihin

mustache

mighty
anxious
to

but

both
right
well
he
had
forgotten
them
and
their
scorn
of
minty
whaih
do
you
live
i
comin
roun
to
see
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
he
knew
how
his
mother
if
not
kit
would
receive
her
and
yet
he
dared
not
anger
this
woman
who
had
his
fate
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
she
saw
his
hesitation
and
spoke
up
oh
that
all
right
let
be
you
know
i
ai
the
kin
o
person
that
holds
a
grudge
anybody
that
right
minty
that
right
he
said
and
gave
her
his
mother
address
then
he
hastened
home
to
prepare
the
way
for
coming
joe
had
no
doubt
but
that
his
mother
would
see
the
matter
quite
as
he
saw
it
and
be
willing
to
temporise
with
minty
but
he
had
reckoned
without
his
host
hamilton
might
make
certain
concessions
to
strangers
on
the
score
of
expediency
but
she
absolutely
refused
to
yield
one
iota
of
her
dignity
to
one
whom
she
had
known
so
long
as
an
inferior
but
do
you
see
what
she
can
do
for
us
ma
she
knows
people
that
i
know
and
she
can
ruin
me
with
them
i

never

to

while

the
floor
angrily

he
cried
you

fannie
looked
at
her

and
she

to

more
clearly
than
she
had
ever

foppery
his
meanness
his
cowardice
well
she
answered
with
a
sigh
it

what

the
boy
reiterated
minty
brown
allowed
no
wind
of
thought
to
cool
the
fire
of
her
determination
she
left
hattie
sterling
soon
after
joe
and
he
was
still
walking
the
floor
and
uttering
dire
forebodings
when
she
rang
the
bell
below
and
asked
for
the
hamiltons
jones
ushered
her
into
her
fearfully
upholstered
parlour
and
then
puffed
up
stairs
to
tell
her
lodgers
that
there
was
a
friend
there
from
the
south
who
wanted
to
see
them

minty
brown
downstairs
had
heard
the
little
colloquy
and
perceiving
that
something
was
amiss
had
come
to
the
stairs
to
listen
now
her
voice
striving
hard
to
be
condescending
and
sweet
but
growing
harsh
with
anger
floated
up
from
below
oh
nevah

jones
gasped
and
then
turned
and
went
hastily
downstairs
kit
burst
out
crying
afresh
and
joe
walked
the
floor
muttering
beneath
his
breath
while
the
mother
sat
grimly
watching
the
outcome
finally
they
heard
jones
step
once
more
on
the
stairs
she
came
in
without
knocking
and
her
manner
was
distinctly
unpleasant
mis
hamilton
she
said

her
hands

cowed
by

few
belongings

a
bundle

many

joe
got
out
of
the
house
as
soon
as
possible
he
did
not
speak
to
kit
nor
look
at
his
mother
he
felt
like
a
cur
because
he
knew
deep
down
in
his
heart
that
he
had
only
been
waiting
for
some
excuse
to
take
this
step
as
he
slammed
the
door
behind
him
his
mother
flung
herself
down
by
kit
side
and
mingled
her
tears
with
her
daughter
but
kit
did
not
raise
her
head
dey
ai
nothin
lef
but
you
now
kit
but
the
girl
did
not
speak
she
only
shook
with
hard
sobs
then
her
mother
raised
her
head
and
almost
screamed
my
gawd
not
you
kit
the
girl
rose
and
then
dropped
unconscious
in
her
mother
arms
joe
took
his
clothes
to
a
that
he
knew
of
and
then
went
to
the
club
to
drink
himself
up
to
the
point
of
going
to
see
hattie
after
the
show
xi
broken
hopes
what
joe
hamilton
lacked
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
was
some
one
to
kick
him
many
a
man
who
might
have
lived
decently
and
become
a
fairly
respectable
citizen
has
gone
to
the
dogs
for
the
want
of
some
one
to
administer
a
good
resounding
kick
at
the
right
time
it
is
corrective
and
clarifying
joe
needed
especially
its
clarifying
property
for
though
he
knew
himself
a
cur
he
went
away
from
his
mother
house
feeling
himself
somehow
aggrieved
and
the
feeling
grew
upon
him
the
more
he
thought
of
it
his
mother
had
ruined
his
chance
in
life
and
he
could
never
hold
up
his
head
again
yes
he
had
heard
that
several
of
the
fellows
at
the
club
had
shady
reputations
but
surely
to
be
the
son
of
a
thief
or
a
supposed
thief
was
not
like
being
the
criminal
himself
at
the
banner
he
took
a
seat
by
himself
and
ordering
a
cocktail
sat
glowering
at
the
few
other
lonely
members
who
had
happened
to
drop
in
there
were
not
many
of
them
and
the
contagion
of
unsociability
had
taken
possession
of
the
house
the
people
sat
scattered
around
at
different
tables
perfectly
unmindful
of
the
bartender
who
cursed
them
under
his
breath
for
not
getting
together
joe
mind
was
filled
with
bitter
thoughts
how
long
had
he
been
away
from
home
he
asked
himself
nearly
a
year
nearly
a
year
passed
in
new
york
and
he
had
come
to
be
what
he
so
much
desired
a
part
of
its
fast
life
and
now
in
a
moment
an
old
woman
stubbornness
had
destroyed
all
that
he
had
builded
what
would
thomas
say
when
he
heard
it
what
would
the
other
fellows
think
and
hattie
it
was
plain
that
she
would
never
notice
him
again
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
the
malice
of
minty
brown
would
prompt
her
to
seek
out
all
of
his
friends
and
make
the
story
known
why
had
he
not
tried
to
placate
her
by
disavowing
sympathy
with
his
mother
he
would
have
had
no
compunction
about
doing
so
but
he
had
thought
of
it
too
late
he
sat
brooding
over
his
trouble
until
the
bartender
called
with
respectful
sarcasm
to
ask
if
he
wanted
to
lease
the
glass
he
had
he
gave
back
a
silly
laugh
gulped
the
rest
of
the
liquor
down
and
was
ordering
another
when
sadness
came
in
he
came
up
directly
to
joe
and
sat
down
beside
him
hamilton
says
it
two
jack
he
said
with
easy
familiarity
well
what
the
matter
old
man
you
looking
glum
i
feel
glum
the
divine
hattie
has
been
cutting
any
capers
has
she
the
dear
old
girl
has
been
getting
hysterical
at
her
age
let
us
hope
not
joe
glared
at
him
why
in
the
devil
should
this
fellow
be
so
sadly
gay
when
he
was
weighted
down
with
sorrow
and
shame
and
disgust
come
come
now
hamilton
if
you
sore
because
i
invited
myself
to
take
a
drink
with
you
i
withdraw
the
order
i
know
the
heroic
thing
to
say
is
that
i
pay
for
the
drinks
myself
but
i
ca
screw
my
courage
up
to
the
point
of
doing
so
unnatural
a
thing
young
hamilton
hastened
to
protest
oh
i
know
you
fellows
now
well
enough
to
know
how
many
drinks
to
pay
for
it
ai
that
well
then
out
with
it
what
is
it
have
been
up
to
anything
have
you
the
desire
came
to
joe
to
tell
this
man
the
whole
truth
just
what
was
the
matter
and
so
to
relieve
his
heart
on
the
impulse
he
did
if
he
had
expected
much
from
sadness
he
was
disappointed
for
not
a
muscle
of
the
man
face
changed
during
the
entire
recital
when
it
was
over
he
looked
at
his
companion
critically
through
a
wreath
of
smoke
then
he
said
for
a
fellow
who
has
had
for
a
full
year
the
advantage
of
the
education
of
the
new
york
clubs
you
are
strangely
young
let
me
see
you
are
nineteen
or
twenty
now
yes
well
that
perhaps
accounts
for
it
it
a
pity
you
were
born
older
it
a
pity
most
men
are
they
would
have
to
take
so
much
time
and
lose
so
many
good
things
learning
now
hamilton
let
me
tell
you
and
you
will
pardon
me
for
it
that
you
are
a
fool
your
case
is
half
as
bad
as
that
of
of
the
fellows
that
hang
around
here
now
for
instance
my
father
was
hung
joe
started
and
gave
a
gasp
of
horror
oh
yes
but
it
was
done
with
a
very
good
rope
and
by
the
best
citizens
of
texas
so
it
seems
that
i
really
ought
to
be
very
grateful
to
them
for
the
distinction
they
conferred
upon
my
family
but
i
am
not
i
am
ungratefully
sad
a
man
must
be
very
high
or
very
low
to
take
the
sensible
view
of
life
that
keeps
him
from
being
sad
i
must
confess
that
i
have
aspired
to
the
depths
without
ever
being
fully
able
to
reach
them
now
look
around
a
bit
see
that
little
girl
over
there
that
viola
two
years
ago
she
wrenched
up
an
iron
stool
from
the
floor
of
a
and
killed
another
woman
with
it
she
nineteen
just
about
your
age
by
the
way
well
she
had
friends
with
a
certain
amount
of
pull
she
got
out
of
it
and
no
one
thinks
the
worse
of
viola
you
see
hamilton
in
this
life
we
are
all
suffering
from
fever
and
no
one
edges
away
from
the
other
because
he
finds
him
a
little
warm
it
dangerous
when
you
not
used
to
it
but
once
you
go
through
the
parching
process
you
become
inoculated
against
further
contagion
now
there
barney
over
there
as
decent
a
fellow
as
i
know
but
he
has
been
indicted
twice
for
a
fellows
whom
you
meet
here
every
night
have
killed
their
man
others
have
done
worse
things
for
which
you
respect
them
less
poor
wallace
who
is
just
coming
in
and
who
looks
like
a
jaunty
ragpicker
came
here
about
six
months
ago
with
about
two
thousand
dollars
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
a
house
his
father
had
left
him
he
sleep
in
one
of
the
club
chairs
and
not
from
choice
he
spent
his
two
thousand
learning
but
after
all
it
was
a
good
investment
it
was
like
buying
an
annuity
he
begins
to
know
already
how
to
live
on
others
as
they
have
lived
on
him
the
plucked
bird
beak
is
sharpened
for
other
feathers
from
now
on
wallace
will
live
eat
drink
and
sleep
at
the
expense
of
others
and
will
forget
to
mourn
his
lost
money
he
will
go
on
this
way
until
broken
and
useless
the
or
the
potter
field
gets
him
oh
it
a
fine
rich
life
my
lad
i
know
you
like
it
i
said
you
would
the
first
time
i
saw
you
it
has
plenty
of
stir
in
it
and
a
man
never
gets
lonesome
only
the
rich
are
lonesome
it
only
the
independent
who
depend
upon
others
sadness
laughed
a
peculiar
laugh
and
there
was
a
look
in
his
terribly
bright
eyes
that
made
joe
creep
if
he
could
only
have
understood
all
that
the
man
was
saying
to
him
he
might
even
yet
have
turned
back
but
he
did
he
ordered
another
drink
the
only
effect
that
the
talk
of
sadness
had
upon
him
was
to
make
him
feel
wonderfully
in
it
it
gave
him
a
false
bravery
and
he
mentally
told
himself
that
now
he
would
not
be
afraid
to
face
hattie
he
put
out
his
hand
to
sadness
with
a
knowing
look
thanks
sadness
he
said
you
helped
me
lots
sadness
brushed
the
proffered
hand
away
and
sprung
up
you
lie
he
cried
i
have
i
was
only
fool
enough
to
try
and
he
turned
hastily
away
from
the
table
joe
looked
surprised
at
first
and
then
laughed
at
his
retreating
form
poor
old
fellow
he
said
drunk
again
must
have
had
something
before
he
came
in
there
was
not
a
lie
in
all
that
sadness
had
said
either
as
to
their
crime
or
their
condition
he
belonged
to
a
peculiar
class
one
that
grows
larger
and
larger
each
year
in
new
york
and
which
has
imitators
in
every
large
city
in
this
country
it
is
a
set
which
lives
like
the
leech
upon
the
blood
of
others
that
draws
its
life
from
the
veins
of
foolish
men
and
immoral
women
that
prides
itself
upon
its
idleness
and
has
no
shame
in
its
voluntary
pauperism
each
member
of
the
class
knows
every
other
his
methods
and
his
limitations
and
their
loyalty
one
to
another
makes
of
them
a
great
hulking
fashionably
uniformed
fraternity
of
indolence
some
play
the
races
a
few
months
of
the
year
others
quite
as
intermittently
gamble
at
shoestring
politics
and
waver
from
party
to
party
as
time
or
their
interests
seem
to
dictate
but
mostly
they
are
like
the
lilies
of
the
field
it
was
into
this
set
that
sadness
had
sarcastically
invited
joe
and
joe
felt
honoured
he
found
that
all
of
his
former
feelings
had
been
silly
and
quite
out
of
place
that
all
he
had
learned
in
his
earlier
years
was
false
it
was
very
plain
to
him
now
that
to
want
a
good
reputation
was
the
sign
of
unpardonable
immaturity
and
that
dishonour
was
the
only
real
thing
worth
while
it
made
him
feel
better
he
was
just
rising
bravely
to
swagger
out
to
the
theatre
when
minty
brown
came
in
with
one
of
the
he
knew
he
bowed
and
smiled
but
she
appeared
not
to
notice
him
at
first
and
when
she
did
she
nudged
her
companion
and
laughed
suddenly
his
little
courage
began
to
ooze
out
and
he
knew
what
she
must
be
saying
to
the
fellow
at
her
side
for
he
looked
over
at
him
and
grinned
where
now
was
the
philosophy
of
sadness
evidently
minty
had
not
been
brought
under
its
educating
influences
and
thought
about
the
whole
matter
in
the
old
ignorant
way
he
began
to
think
of
it
too
somehow
old
teachings
and
old
traditions
have
an
annoying
way
of
coming
back
upon
us
in
the
critical
moments
of
life
although
one
has
long
ago
recognised
how
much
truer
and
better
some
newer
ways
of
thinking
are
but
joe
would
not
allow
minty
to
shatter
his
dreams
by
bringing
up
these
old
notions
she
must
be
instructed
he
rose
and
went
over
to
her
table
why
minty
he
said
offering
his
hand
you
ai
mad
at
me
are
you
go
on
away
hyeah
she
said
angrily
i
do
want
none
thievin
berry
hamilton
fambly
to
speak
to
me
why
you
were
all
right
this
evening
yes
but
jest
out
o
pity
an
you
was
nice
you
was
afraid
i
tell
on
you
go
on
now
go
on
now
said
minty
young
man
and
he
looked
menacing
joe
what
little
he
had
gone
slunk
out
of
the
room
and
needed
several
whiskeys
in
a
neighbouring
saloon
to
give
him
courage
to
go
to
the
theatre
and
wait
for
hattie
who
was
playing
in
vaudeville
houses
pending
the
opening
of
her
company
the
closing
act
was
just
over
when
he
reached
the
stage
door
he
was
there
but
a
short
time
when
hattie
tripped
out
and
took
his
arm
her
face
was
bright
and
smiling
and
there
was
no
suggestion
of
disgust
in
the
dancing
eyes
she
turned
up
to
him
evidently
she
had
not
heard
but
the
thought
gave
him
no
particular
pleasure
as
it
left
him
in
suspense
as
to
how
she
would
act
when
she
should
hear
let
go
somewhere
and
get
some
supper
she
said
i
as
hungry
as
i
can
be
what
are
you
looking
so
cut
up
about
oh
i
ai
feelin
so
very
good
i
hope
you
ai
lettin
that
brown
woman
bother
your
head
are
you
his
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
she
did
know
then
do
you
know
all
about
it
why
of
course
i
do
you
might
know
she
come
to
me
first
with
her
story
and
you
still
keep
on
speaking
to
me
now
look
here
joe
if
you
been
drinking
i
forgive
you
if
you
ai
you
go
on
and
leave
me
say
what
do
you
take
me
for
do
you
think
i
throw
down
a
friend
because
somebody
else
talked
about
him
well
you
do
know
hat
sterling
when
minty
told
me
that
story
she
was
back
in
my
and
i
sent
her
out
o
there
and
with
a
that
she
wo
forget
for
a
month
o
sundays
i
reckon
that
was
the
reason
she
jumped
on
me
so
hard
at
the
club
he
chuckled
he
had
taken
heart
again
all
that
sadness
had
said
was
true
after
all
and
people
thought
no
less
of
him
his
joy
was
unbounded
so
she
jumped
on
you
hard
did
she
the
cat
oh
she
did
say
a
thing
to
me
well
joe
it
just
like
this
i
ai
an
angel
you
know
that
but
i
do
try
to
be
square
and
whenever
i
find
a
friend
of
mine
down
on
his
luck
in
his
or
his
feelings
why
i
give
him
my
flipper
why
old
chap
i
believe
i
like
you
better
for
the
stiff
upper
lip
you
been
keeping
under
all
this
why
hattie
he
broke
out
unable
any
longer
to
control
himself
you
you
oh
i
just
plain
hat
sterling
who
wo
throw
down
her
friends
now
come
on
and
get
something
to
eat
if
that
thing
is
at
the
club
we
go
there
and
show
her
just
how
much
her
talk
amounted
to
she
thinks
she
the
whole
game
but
i
can
spot
her
and
then
show
her
that
she
one
two
three
when
they
reached
the
banner
they
found
minty
still
there
she
tried
on
the
two
the
same
tactics
that
she
had
employed
so
successfully
upon
joe
alone
she
nudged
her
companion
and
tittered
but
she
had
another
person
to
deal
with
hattie
sterling
stared
at
her
coldly
and
indifferently
and
passed
on
by
her
to
a
seat
joe
proceeded
to
order
supper
and
other
things
in
the
nonchalant
way
that
the
woman
had
enjoined
upon
him
minty
began
to
feel
distinctly
uncomfortable
but
it
was
her
business
not
to
be
beaten
she
laughed
outright
hattie
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
she
was
beckoning
sadness
to
her
side
he
came
and
sat
down
now
look
here
she
said
you
ca
have
any
supper
because
you
have
reached
the
stage
of
magnificent
hunger
to
make
a
meal
palatable
to
you
you
got
so
used
to
being
nearly
starved
that
a
meal
do
taste
good
to
you
under
any
other
circumstances
you
in
on
the
drinks
though
your
thirst
is
always
jack
she
called
down
the
long
room
to
the
bartender
make
it
lean
over
here
i
want
to
talk
to
you
see
that
woman
over
there
by
the
wall
no
not
that
one
the
big
light
woman
with
griggs
well
she
come
here
with
a
story
trying
to
throw
joe
down
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
do
her
oh
that
the
one
that
upset
our
young
friend
is
it
said
sadness
turning
his
mournful
eyes
upon
minty
that
her
so
you
know
about
it
do
you
yes
and
i
help
do
her
she
must
touch
one
of
the
fraternity
you
know
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
outsider
until
she
squirmed
she
could
not
at
all
understand
this
serious
conversation
directed
at
her
she
wondered
if
she
had
gone
too
far
and
if
they
contemplated
putting
her
out
it
made
her
uneasy
now
this
same
miss
sterling
had
the
faculty
of
attracting
a
good
deal
of
attention
when
she
wished
to
she
brought
it
into
play
and
in
ten
minutes
aided
by
sadness
she
had
a
crowd
of
jolly
people
about
her
table
when
as
she
would
have
expressed
it
everything
was
going
fat
she
suddenly
paused
and
turning
her
eyes
full
upon
minty
said
in
a
voice
loud
enough
for
all
to
hear
say
boys
you
heard
that
story
about
joe
have
you
they
had
well
that
the
one
that
told
it
she
come
here
to
try
to
throw
him
and
me
down
is
she
going
to
do
it
well
i
guess
not
was
the
rousing
reply
and
every
face
turned
towards
the
now
frightened
minty
she
rose
hastily
and
getting
her
skirts
together
fled
from
the
room
followed
more
leisurely
by
the
crestfallen
griggs
hattie
laugh
and
thank
you
fellows
followed
her
out
matters
were
less
easy
for
joe
mother
and
sister
than
they
were
for
him
a
week
or
more
after
this
kitty
found
him
and
told
him
that
minty
story
had
reached
their
employers
and
that
they
were
out
of
work
you
see
joe
she
said
sadly
we
took
a
flat
since
we
moved
from
mis
jones
and
we
had
to
furnish
it
we
got
one
lodger
a
man
an
he
mighty
nice
to
ma
an
me
but
that
enough
now
we
got
to
do
something
joe
was
so
smitten
with
sorrow
that
he
gave
her
a
dollar
and
promised
to
speak
about
the
matter
to
a
friend
of
his
he
did
speak
about
it
to
hattie
you
told
me
once
or
twice
that
your
sister
could
sing
bring
her
down
here
to
me
and
if
she
can
do
anything
i
get
her
a
place
on
the
stage
was
hattie
answer
when
kitty
heard
it
she
was
radiant
but
her
mother
only
shook
her
head
and
said
de
las
hope
de
las
hope
xii
all
the
world
a
stage
kitty
proved
herself
joe
sister
by
falling
desperately
in
love
with
hattie
sterling
the
first
time
they
met
the
actress
was
very
gracious
to
her
and
called
her
child
in
a
pretty
patronising
way
and
patted
her
on
the
cheek
it
a
shame
that
joe
has
brought
you
around
before
we
been
good
friends
for
quite
some
time
he
told
me
you
an
him
was
right
good
friends
already
joe
took
on
a
new
importance
in
his
sister
eyes
he
must
be
quite
a
man
she
thought
to
be
the
friend
of
such
a
person
as
miss
sterling
so
you
think
you
want
to
go
on
the
stage
do
you
yes
i
thought
it
might
be
right
nice
for
me
if
i
could
joe
go
out
and
get
some
beer
for
us
and
then
i
hear
your
sister
sing
miss
sterling
talked
as
if
she
were
a
manager
and
had
only
to
snap
her
fingers
to
be
obeyed
when
joe
came
back
with
the
beer
kitty
drank
a
glass
she
did
not
like
it
but
she
would
not
offend
her
hostess
after
this
she
sang
and
miss
sterling
applauded
her
generously
although
the
young
girl
nervousness
kept
her
from
doing
her
best
the
encouragement
helped
her
and
she
did
better
as
she
became
more
at
home
why
child
you
got
a
good
voice
and
joe
you
been
keeping
her
shut
up
all
this
time
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
the
young
man
had
little
to
say
he
had
brought
kitty
almost
under
a
protest
because
he
had
no
confidence
in
her
ability
and
thought
that
his
girl
would
disillusion
her
it
did
not
please
him
now
to
find
his
sister
so
fully
under
the
limelight
and
himself
up
stage
kitty
was
quite
in
a
flutter
of
delight
not
so
much
with
the
idea
of
working
as
with
the
glamour
of
the
work
she
might
be
allowed
to
do
i
tell
you
now
hattie
sterling
pursued
throwing
a
brightly
stockinged
foot
upon
a
chair
your
voice
is
too
good
for
the
chorus
gi
me
a
cigarette
joe
have
one
kitty
i
goin
to
call
you
kitty
it
nice
and
homelike
and
then
we
got
to
be
great
chums
you
know
kitty
unwilling
to
refuse
anything
from
the
sorceress
took
her
cigarette
and
lighted
it
but
a
few
puffs
set
her
off
coughing
tut
tut
kitty
child
do
do
it
if
you
ai
used
to
it
you
learn
soon
enough
joe
wanted
to
kick
his
sister
for
having
tried
so
delicate
an
art
and
failed
for
he
had
not
yet
lost
all
of
his
awe
of
hattie
now
what
i
was
going
to
say
the
lady
resumed
after
several
contemplative
puffs
is
that
you
have
to
begin
in
the
chorus
any
way
and
work
your
way
up
it
would
take
long
for
you
with
your
looks
and
voice
to
put
one
of
the
and
ups
out
o
the
business
only
hope
it
wo
be
me
i
had
people
i
helped
try
to
do
it
often
enough
she
gave
a
laugh
that
had
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
it
for
she
began
to
recognise
that
although
she
had
been
on
the
stage
only
a
short
time
she
was
no
longer
the
hattie
sterling
in
the
first
freshness
of
her
youth
oh
i
would
want
to
push
anybody
out
kit
expostulated
oh
never
mind
you
soon
get
bravely
over
that
feeling
and
even
if
you
did
it
would
matter
much
the
thing
has
to
happen
somebody
got
to
go
down
we
do
last
long
in
this
life
it
soon
wears
us
out
and
when
we
worn
out
and
sung
out
danced
out
and
played
out
the
manager
has
no
further
use
for
us
so
he
reduces
us
to
the
ranks
or
kicks
us
out
entirely
joe
here
thought
it
time
for
him
to
put
in
a
word
get
out
hat
he
said
contemptuously
you
good
for
a
dozen
years
yet
she
did
deign
to
notice
him
save
so
far
as
a
sniff
goes
do
you
let
what
i
say
scare
you
though
kitty
you
got
a
good
chance
and
maybe
you
have
more
sense
than
i
got
and
at
least
save
money
while
you
in
it
but
let
get
off
that
it
makes
me
sick
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
come
to
the
and
i
introduce
you
to
the
manager
he
a
fool
but
i
think
we
can
make
him
do
something
for
you
oh
thank
you
i
be
around
sure
better
come
about
ten
there
a
rehearsal
and
you
find
him
there
of
course
he
be
pretty
rough
he
always
is
at
rehearsals
but
he
take
to
you
if
he
thinks
there
anything
in
you
and
he
can
get
it
out
kitty
felt
herself
dismissed
and
rose
to
go
joe
did
not
rise
i
see
you
later
kit
he
said
i
ai
goin
just
yet
say
he
added
when
his
sister
was
gone
you
a
hot
one
what
do
you
want
to
give
her
all
that
con
for
she
never
get
in
joe
said
hattie
do
you
get
awful
tired
of
being
a
jackass
sometimes
i
want
to
kiss
you
and
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
i
had
to
kick
you
i
compromise
with
you
now
by
letting
you
bring
me
some
more
beer
this
got
all
stale
while
your
sister
was
here
i
saw
she
did
like
it
and
so
i
would
drink
any
more
for
fear
she
try
to
keep
up
with
me
kit
is
a
good
deal
of
a
jay
yet
joe
remarked
wisely
oh
yes
this
world
is
full
of
jays
lots
of
have
seen
enough
to
make
wise
but
they
still
jays
and
do
know
it
that
the
worst
of
it
they
go
around
thinking
they
it
when
they
ai
even
in
the
game
go
on
and
get
the
beer
and
joe
went
feeling
vaguely
that
he
had
been

upon
kit

home
with
joyous
heart

her

up
to

just
what
effect
her
plea
would
have
on
her
daughter
she
hoped
that
what
she
said
would
have
the
desired
result
but
the
girl
turned
around
from
fixing
her
before
the
glass
her
face
radiant
why
it
be
splendid
he
such
a
nice
man
men

fin
and
hamilton
rose
and
tottered
from
the
room
as
if
the
old
age
she
anticipated
had
already
come
upon
her
kit
stood
looking
after
her
fear
and
grief
in
her
eyes
poor
ma
she
said
an
poor
pa
but
i
know
an
i
know
it
for
the
best
on
the
next
morning
she
was
up
early
and
practising
hard
for
her
interview
with
the
managing
star
of
martin
blackbirds
when
she
arrived
at
the
theatre
hattie
sterling
met
her
with
frank
friendliness
i
glad
you
came
early
kitty
she
remarked
for
maybe
you
can
get
a
chance
to
talk
with
martin
before
he
begins
rehearsal
and
gets
all
worked
up
he
be
a
little
less
like
a
bear
then
but
even
if
you
do
see
him
before
then
wait
and
do
get
scared
if
he
tries
to
bluff
you
his
bark
is
a
good
deal
worse
than
his
bite
when
martin
came
in
that
morning
he
had
other
ideas
than
that
of
seeing
applicants
for
places
his
show
must
begin
in
two
weeks
and
it
was
advertised
to
be
larger
and
better
than
ever
before
when
really
nothing
at
all
had
been
done
for
it
the
promise
of
this
advertisement
must
be
fulfilled
martin
was
late
and
was
out
of
humour
with
every
one
else
on
account
of
it
he
came
in
hurried
fierce
and
important
mornin
smith
mornin
jones
ha
ladies
and
gentlemen
all
here
he
shot
every
word
out
of
his
mouth
as
if
the
of
it
were
unpleasant
to
him
he
walked
among
the
chorus
like
an
angry
king
among
his
vassals
and
his
glance
was
a
flash
of
insolent
fire
from
his
head
to
his
feet
he
was
the
very
epitome
of
brutal
conceit
kitty
trembled
as
she
noted
the
hush
that
fell
on
the
people
at
his
entrance
she
felt
like
rushing
out
of
the
room
she
could
never
face
this
terrible
man
she
trembled
more
as
she
found
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
who
that
he
asked
disregarding
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
stick
or
a
stone
well
do
snap
her
head
off
it
a
girl
friend
of
mine
that
wants
a
place
said
hattie
she
was
the
only
one
who
would
brave
martin
humph
let
her
wait
i
ai
got
no
time
to
hear
any
one
now
get
yourselves
in
line
you
all
who
are
on
to
that
first
chorus
while
i
getting
into
my
he
disappeared
behind
a
screen
whence
he
emerged
arrayed
or
only
half
arrayed
in
a
thick
absorbing
shirt
and
a
thin
pair
of
woollen
trousers
then
the
work
began
the
man
was
indefatigable
he
was
like
the
spirit
of
energy
he
was
in
every
place
about
the
stage
at
once
leading
the
chorus
showing
them
steps
twisting
some
awkward
girl
into
shape
shouting
gesticulating
abusing
the
pianist
now
now
he
would
shout
the
left
foot
on
that
beat
bah

your
mouths
and
move

oh
and
he
would
drop
his
head
in
despair
and
to
think
that
i
got
to
do
something
with
these
things
in
two
weeks
two
weeks
then
he
would
turn
to
them
again
with
a
sudden
reaccession
of
eagerness
now
at
it
again
at
it
again
hold
that
note
hold
it
now
whirl
and
on
the
left
foot
stop
that
music
stop
it
miss
coster
you
learn
that
step
in
about
a
thousand
years
and
i
got
nine
hundred
and
years
and
fifty
weeks
less
time
than
that
to
spare
come
here
and
try
that
step
with
me
do
be
afraid
to
move
step
like
a
chicken
on
a
hot
griddle
and
some
blushing
girl
would
come
forward
and
go
through
the
step
alone
before
all
the
rest
kitty
contemplated
the
scene
with
a
mind
equally
divided
between
fear
and
anger
what
should
she
do
if
he
should
so
speak
to
her
like
the
others
no
doubt
smile
sheepishly
and
obey
him
but
she
did
not
like
to
believe
it
she
felt
that
the
independence
which
she
had
known
from
babyhood
would
assert
itself
and
that
she
would
talk
back
to
him
even
as
hattie
sterling
did
she
felt
scared
and
discouraged
but
every
now
and
then
her
friend
smiled
encouragingly
upon
her
across
the
ranks
of
moving
singers
finally
however
her
thoughts
were
broken
in
upon
by
hearing
martin
cry
oh
quit
quit
and
go
rest
yourselves
you
ancient
pieces
of
hickory
and
let
me
forget
you
for
a
minute
before
i
go
crazy
where
that
new
girl
now
kitty
rose
and
went
toward
him
trembling
so
that
she
could
hardly
walk
what
can
you
do
i
can
sing
very
faintly
well
if
that
the
voice
you
going
to
sing
in
there
wo
be
many
that
know
whether
it
good
or
bad
well
let
hear
something
do
you
know
any
of
these
and
he
ran
over
the
titles
of
several
songs
she
knew
some
of
them
and
he
selected
one
try
this
here
tom
play
it
for
her
it
was
an
ordeal
for
the
girl
to
go
through
she
had
never
sung
before
at
anything
more
formidable
than
a
church
concert
where
only
her
immediate
acquaintances
and
townspeople
were
present
now
to
sing
before
all
these
strange
people
themselves
singers
made
her
feel
faint
and
awkward
but
the
courage
of
desperation
came
to
her
and
she
struck
into
the
song
at
the
first
her
voice
wavered
and
threatened
to
fail
her
it
must
not
she
choked
back
her
fright
and
forced
the
music
from
her
lips
when
she
was
done
she
was
startled
to
hear
martin
burst
into
a
raucous
laugh
such
humiliation
she
had
failed
and
instead
of
telling
her
he
was
bringing
her
to
shame
before
the
whole
company
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
was
about
giving
way
when
she
caught
a
reassuring
nod
and
smile
from
hattie
sterling
and
seized
on
this
as
a
last
hope
haw
haw
haw
laughed
martin
haw
haw
haw
the
little
one
was
scared
see
she
was
scared
d
you
understand
but
did
you
see
the
grit
she
went
at
it
with
just
took
the
bit
in
her
teeth
and
got
away
haw
haw
haw
now
that
what
i
like
if
all
you
girls
had
that
spirit
we
could
do
something
in
two
weeks
try
another
one
girl
kitty
heart
had
suddenly
grown
light
she
sang
the
second
one
better
because
something
within
her
was
singing
good
said
martin
but
he
immediately
returned
to
his
cold
manner
you
watch
these
girls
close
and
see
what
they
do
and
be
prepared
to
go
into
line
and
move
as
well
as
sing
he
immediately
turned
his
attention
from
her
to
the
chorus
but
no
slight
that
he
could
inflict
upon
her
now
could
take
away
the
sweet
truth
that
she
was
engaged
and
would
begin
work
she
wished
she
could
go
over
and
embrace
hattie
sterling
she
thought
kindly
of
joe
and
promised
herself
to
give
him
a
present
out
of
her
first
earnings
on
the
first
night
of
the
show
pretty
little
kitty
hamilton
was
pointed
out
as
a
girl
who
would
be
in
the
chorus
long
the
mother
who
was
soon
to
be
gibson
sat
in
the
balcony
a
grieved
pained
look
on
her
face
joe
was
in
a
front
row
with
some
of
the
rest
of
the
gang
he
took
many
drinks
between
the
acts
because
he
was
proud
thomas
was
there
he
also
was
proud
and
after
the
performance
he
waited
for
kitty
at
the
stage
door
and
went
forward
to
meet
her
as
she
came
out
the
look
she
gave
him
stopped
him
and
he
let
her
pass
without
a
word
who
thought
he
mused
that
the
kid
had
that
much
nerve
well
if
they
do
want
to
find
out
things
what
do
they
come
to
n
yawk
for
it
ai
nobody
old
picnic
guess
i
got
out
easy
anyhow
hattie
sterling
took
joe
home
in
a
hansom
say
she
said
if
you
come
this
way
for
me
again
it
all
over
see
your
little
sister
a
comer
and
i
got
to
hustle
to
keep
up
with
her
joe
growled
and
fell
asleep
in
his
chair
one
must
needs
have
a
strong
head
or
a
strong
will
when
one
is
the
brother
of
a
celebrity
and
would
celebrate
the
distinguished
one
success
xiii
the
oakleys
a
year
after
the
arrest
of
berry
hamilton
and
at
a
time
when
new
york
had
shown
to
the
eyes
of
his
family
so
many
strange
new
sights
there
were
few
changes
to
be
noted
in
the
condition
of
affairs
at
the
oakley
place
maurice
oakley
was
perhaps
a
shade
more
distrustful
of
his
servants
and
consequently
more
testy
with
them
oakley
was
the
same
acquiescent
woman
with
unbounded
faith
in
her
husband
wisdom
and
judgment
with
complacent
minds
both
went
their
ways
drank
their
wine
and
said
their
prayers
and
wished
that
brother
frank
five
years
were
past
they
had
letters
from
him
now
and
then
never
very
cheerful
in
tone
but
always
breathing
the
deepest
love
and
gratitude
to
them
his
brother
found
deep
cause
for
congratulation
in
the
tone
of
these
epistles
frank
is
getting
down
to
work
he
would
cry
exultantly
he
is
past
the
first
buoyant
enthusiasm
of
youth
ah
leslie
when
a
man
begins
to
be
serious
then
he
begins
to
be
something
and
her
only
answer
would
be
i
wonder
maurice
if
claire
lessing
will
wait
for
him
the
two
had
frequent
questions
to
answer
as
to
frank
doing
and
prospects
and
they
had
always
bright
things
to
say
of
him
even
when
his
letters
gave
them
no
such
warrant
their
love
for
him
made
them
read
large
between
the
lines
and
all
they
read
was
good
between
maurice
and
his
brother
no
word
of
the
guilty
servant
ever
passed
they
each
avoided
it
as
an
unpleasant
subject
frank
had
never
asked
and
his
brother
had
never
proffered
aught
of
the
outcome
of
the
case
oakley
had
once
suggested
it
brother
ought
to
know
she
said
that
berry
is
being
properly
punished
by
no
means
replied
her
husband
you
know
that
it
would
only
hurt
him
he
shall
never
know
if
i
have
to
tell
him
you
are
right
maurice
you
are
always
right
we
must
shield
frank
from
the
pain
it
would
cause
him
poor
fellow
he
is
so
sensitive
their
hearts
were
still
steadfastly
fixed
upon
the
union
of
this
younger
brother
with
claire
lessing
she
had
lately
come
into
a
fortune
and
there
was
nothing
now
to
prevent
it
they
would
have
written
frank
to
urge
it
but
they
both
believed
that
to
try
to
woo
him
away
from
his
art
was
but
to
make
him
more
wayward
that
any
woman
could
have
power
enough
to
take
him
away
from
this
jealous
mistress
they
very
much
doubted
but
they
could
hope
and
hope
made
them
eager
to
open
every
letter
that
bore
the
french
postmark
always
it
might
contain
news
that
he
was
coming
home
or
that
he
had
made
a
great
success
or
better
some
inquiry
after
claire
a
long
time
they
had
waited
but
found
no
such
tidings
in
the
letters
from
paris
at
last
as
maurice
oakley
sat
in
his
library
one
day
the
servant
brought
him
a
letter
more
bulky
in
weight
and
appearance
than
any
he
had
yet
received
his
eyes
glistened
with
pleasure
as
he
read
the
postmark
a
letter
from
frank
he
said
joyfully
and
an
important
one
i
wager
he
smiled
as
he
weighed
it
in
his
hand
and
caressed
it
oakley
was
out
shopping
and
as
he
knew
how
deep
her
interest
was
he
hesitated
to
break
the
seal
before
she
returned
he
curbed
his
natural
desire
and
laid
the
heavy
envelope
down
on
the
desk
but
he
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
speculating
as
to
its
contents
it
was
such
a
large
package
what
might
it
not
contain
it
simply
reeked
of
possibilities
had
any
one
banteringly
told
maurice
oakley
that
he
had
such
a
deep
vein
of
sentiment
he
would
have
denied
it
with
scorn
and
laughter
but
here
he
found
himself
sitting
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
weaving
stories
as
to
its
contents
first
now
it
might
be
a
notice
that
frank
had
received
the
badge
of
the
legion
of
honour
no
no
that
was
too
big
and
he
laughed
aloud
at
his
own
folly
wondering
the
next
minute
with
half
shame
why
he
laughed
for
did
he
after
all
believe
anything
was
too
big
for
that
brother
of
his
well
let
him
begin
anyway
away
down
let
him
say
for
instance
that
the
letter
told
of
the
completion
and
sale
of
a
great
picture
frank
had
sold
small
ones
he
would
be
glad
of
this
for
his
brother
had
written
him
several
times
of
things
that
were
but
not
yet
of
anything
that
was
done
or
better
yet
let
the
letter
say
that
some
picture
long
finished
but
of
which
the
artist
pride
and
anxiety
had
forbidden
him
to
speak
had
made
a
glowing
success
the
success
it
deserved
this
sounded
well
and
seemed
not
at
all
beyond
the
bounds
of
possibility
it
was
an
alluring
vision
he
saw
the
picture
already
it
was
a
scene
from
life
true
in
detail
to
the
point
of
very
minuteness
and
yet
with
something
spiritual
in
it
that
lifted
it
above
the
mere
copy
of
the
commonplace
at
the
salon
it
would
be
hung
on
the
line
and
people
would
stand
before
it
admiring
its
workmanship
and
asking
who
the
artist
was
he
drew
on
his
memory
of
old
reading
in
his
mind
eye
he
saw
frank
unconscious
of
his
own
power
or
too
modest
to
admit
it
stand
unknown
among
the
crowds
around
his
picture
waiting
for
and
dreading
their
criticisms
he
saw
the
light
leap
to
his
eyes
as
he
heard
their
words
of
praise
he
saw
the
straightening
of
his
narrow
shoulders
when
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
he
was
the
painter
of
the
work
then
the
windows
of
paris
were
filled
with
his
portraits
the
papers
were
full
of
his
praise
and
brave
men
and
fair
women
met
together
to
do
him
homage
fair
women
yes
and
frank
would
look
upon
them
all
and
see
reflected
in
them
but
a
tithe
of
the
glory
of
one
woman
and
that
woman
claire
lessing
he
roused
himself
and
laughed
again
as
he
tapped
the
magic
envelope
my
fancies
go
on
and
conquer
the
world
for
my
brother
he
muttered
he
will
follow
their
flight
one
day
and
do
it
himself
the
letter
drew
his
eyes
back
to
it
it
seemed
to
invite
him
to
beg
him
even
no
i
will
not
do
it
i
will
wait
until
leslie
comes
she
will
be
as
glad
to
hear
the
good
news
as
i
am
his
dreams
were
taking
the
shape
of
reality
in
his
mind
and
he
was
believing
all
that
he
wanted
to
believe
he
turned
to
look
at
a
picture
painted
by
frank
which
hung
over
the
mantel
he
dwelt
lovingly
upon
it
seeing
in
it
the
touch
of
a
genius
surely
he
said
this
new
picture
can
not
be
greater
than
that
though
it
shall
hang
where
kings
can
see
it
and
this
only
graces
the
library
of
my
poor
house
it
has
the
feeling
of
a
woman
soul
with
the
strength
of
a
man
heart
when
frank
and
claire
marry
i
shall
give
it
back
to
them
it
is
too
great
a
treasure
for
a
clod
like
me
heigho
why
will
women
be
so
long
he
glanced
again
at
the
letter
and
his
hand
went
out
involuntarily
towards
it
he
fondled
it
smiling
ah
lady
leslie
i
a
mind
to
open
it
to
punish
you
for
staying
so
long
he
essayed
to
be
playful
but
he
knew
that
he
was
trying
to
make
a
compromise
with
himself
because
his
eagerness
grew
stronger
than
his
gallantry
he
laid
the
letter
down
and
picked
it
up
again
he
studied
the
postmark
over
and
over
he
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
and
back
again
and
then
began
fumbling
in
his
pockets
for
his
knife
no
he
did
not
want
it
yes
he
did
he
would
just
cut
the
envelope
and
make
believe
he
had
read
it
to
pique
his
wife
but
he
would
not
read
it
yes
that
was
it
he
found
the
knife
and
slit
the
paper
his
fingers
trembled
as
he
touched
the
sheets
that
protruded
why
would
not
leslie
come
did
she
not
know
that
he
was
waiting
for
her
she
ought
to
have
known
that
there
was
a
letter
from
paris
for
it
had
been
a
month
since
they
had
had
one
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
without
he
sprang
up
crying
i
been
waiting
so
long
for
you
a
servant
opened
the
door
to
bring
him
a
message
oakley
dismissed
him
angrily
what
did
he
want
to
go
down
to
the
continental
for
to
drink
and
talk
politics
to
a
lot
of
fools
when
he
had
a
brother
in
paris
who
was
an
artist
and
a
letter
from
him
lay
unread
in
his
hand
his
patience
and
his
temper
were
going
leslie
was
careless
and
unfeeling
she
ought
to
come
he
was
tired
of
waiting
a
carriage
rolled
up
the
driveway
and
he
dropped
the
letter
guiltily
as
if
it
were
not
his
own
he
would
only
say
that
he
had
grown
tired
of
waiting
and
started
to
read
it
but
it
was
only
davis
footman
leaving
a
note
for
leslie
about
some
charity
he
went
back
to
the
letter
well
it
was
his
leslie
had
forfeited
her
right
to
see
it
as
soon
as
he
it
might
be
mean
but
it
was
not
dishonest
no
he
would
not
read
it
now
but
he
would
take
it
out
and
show
her
that
he
had
exercised
his
in
spite
of
her
shortcomings
he
laid
it
on
the
desk
once
more
it
leered
at
him
he
might
just
open
the
sheets
enough
to
see
the
lines
that
began
it
and
read
no
further
yes
he
would
do
that
leslie
could
not
feel
hurt
at
such
a
little
thing
the
first
line
had
only
dear
brother
dear
brother
why
not
the
second
that
could
not
hold
much
more
the
second
line
held
him
and
the
third
and
the
fourth
and
as
he
read
on
unmindful
now
of
what
leslie
might
think
or
feel
his
face
turned
from
the
ruddy
glow
of
pleasant
anxiety
to
the
pallor
of
grief
and
terror
he
was
not
through
it
when
oakley
voice
in
the
hall
announced
her
coming
he
did
not
hear
her
he
sat
staring
at
the
page
before
him
his
lips
apart
and
his
eyes
staring
then
with
a
cry
that
echoed
through
the
house
crumpling
the
sheets
in
his
hand
he
fell
forward
fainting
to
the
floor
just
as
his
wife
rushed
into
the
room
what
is
it
she
cried
maurice
maurice
he
lay
on
the
floor
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
the
letter
clutched
in
his
hands
she
ran
to
him
and
lifted
up
his
head
but
he
gave
no
sign
of
life
already
the
servants
were
crowding
to
the
door
she
bade
one
of
them
to
hasten
for
a
doctor
others
to
bring
water
and
brandy
and
the
rest
to
be
gone
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
she
loosed
the
crumpled
sheets
from
his
hand
for
she
felt
that
this
must
have
been
the
cause
of
her
husband
strange
attack
without
a
thought
of
wrong
for
they
had
no
secrets
from
each
other
she
glanced
at
the
opening
lines
then
she
forgot
the
unconscious
man
at
her
feet
and
read
the
letter
through
to
the
end
the
letter
was
in
frank
neat
hand
a
little
shaken
perhaps
by
nervousness
dear
brother
it
ran
i
know
you
will
grieve
at
receiving
this
and
i
wish
that
i
might
bear
your
grief
for
you
but
i
can
not
though
i
have
as
heavy
a
burden
as
this
can
bring
to
you
mine
would
have
been
lighter
perhaps
had
you
been
more
straightforward
with
me
i
am
not
blaming
you
however
for
i
know
that
my
hypocrisy
made
you
believe
me
possessed
of
a
really
soft
heart
and
you
thought
to
spare
me
until
yesterday
when
in
a
letter
from
esterton
he
casually
mentioned
the
matter
i
did
not
know
that
berry
was
in
prison
else
this
letter
would
have
been
written
sooner
i
have
been
wanting
to
write
it
for
so
long
and
yet
have
been
too
great
a
coward
to
do
so
i
know
that
you
will
be
disappointed
in
me
and
just
what
that
disappointment
will
cost
you
i
know
but
you
must
hear
the
truth
i
shall
never
see
your
face
again
or
i
should
not
dare
to
tell
it
even
now
you
will
remember
that
i
begged
you
to
be
easy
on
your
servant
you
thought
it
was
only
my
kindness
of
heart
it
was
not
i
had
a
deeper
reason
i
knew
where
the
money
had
gone
and
dared
not
tell
berry
is
as
innocent
as
yourself
and
i
well
it
is
a
story
and
let
me
tell
it
to
you
you
have
had
so
much
confidence
in
me
and
i
hate
to
tell
you
that
it
was
all
misplaced
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
should
not
be
doing
it
now
but
that
i
have
drunken
absinthe
enough
to
give
me
the
emotional
point
of
view
which
i
shall
regret
i
do
not
mean
that
i
am
drunk
i
can
think
clearly
and
write
clearly
but
my
emotions
are
extremely
active
do
you
remember
claire
saying
at
the
table
that
night
of
the
farewell
dinner
that
some
mademoiselle
was
waiting
for
me
she
did
not
know
how
truly
she
spoke
though
i
fancy
she
saw
how
i
flushed
when
she
said
it
for
i
was
already
in
love
madly
so
i
need
not
describe
her
i
need
say
nothing
about
her
for
i
know
that
nothing
i
say
can
ever
persuade
you
to
forgive
her
for
taking
me
from
you
this
has
gone
on
since
i
first
came
here
and
i
dared
not
tell
you
for
i
saw
whither
your
eyes
had
turned
i
loved
this
girl
and
she
both
inspired
and
hindered
my
work
perhaps
i
would
have
been
successful
had
i
not
met
her
perhaps
not
i
love
her
too
well
to
marry
her
and
make
of
our
devotion
a
stale
prosy
thing
of
duty
and
compulsion
when
a
man
does
not
marry
a
woman
he
must
keep
her
better
than
he
would
a
wife
it
costs
all
that
you
gave
me
went
to
make
her
happy
then
when
i
was
about
leaving
you
the
catastrophe
came
i
wanted
much
to
carry
back
to
her
i
gambled
to
make
more
i
would
surprise
her
luck
was
against
me
night
after
night
i
lost
then
just
before
the
dinner
i
woke
from
my
frenzy
to
find
all
that
i
had
was
gone
i
would
have
asked
you
for
more
and
you
would
have
given
it
but
that
strange
ridiculous
something
which
we
misname
southern
honour
that
honour
which
strains
at
a
gnat
and
swallows
a
camel
withheld
me
and
i
preferred
to
do
worse
so
i
lied
to
you
the
money
from
my
cabinet
was
not
stolen
save
by
myself
i
am
a
liar
and
a
thief
but
your
eyes
shall
never
tell
me
so
tell
the
truth
and
have
berry
released
i
can
stand
it
write
me
but
one
letter
to
tell
me
of
this
do
not
plead
with
me
do
not
forgive
me
do
not
seek
to
find
me
for
from
this
time
i
shall
be
as
one
who
has
perished
from
the
earth
i
shall
be
no
more
your
brother
frank
by
the
time
the
servants
came
they
found
oakley
as
white
as
her
lord
but
with
firm
hands
and
compressed
lips
she
ministered
to
his
needs
pending
the
doctor
arrival
she
bathed
his
face
and
temples
chafed
his
hands
and
forced
the
brandy
between
his
lips
finally
he
stirred
and
his
hands
gripped
the
letter
he
gasped
yes
dear
i
have
it
i
have
it
give
it
to
me
he
cried
she
handed
it
to
him
he
seized
it
and
thrust
it
into
his
breast
did
did
you
read
it
yes
i
did
not
know
oh
my
god
i
did
not
intend
that
you
should
see
it
i
wanted
the
secret
for
my
own
i
wanted
to
carry
it
to
my
grave
with
me
oh
frank
frank
frank
never
mind
maurice
it
is
as
if
you
alone
knew
it
it
is
not
i
say
it
is
not
he
turned
upon
his
face
and
began
to
weep
passionately
not
like
a
man
but
like
a
child
whose
last
toy
has
been
broken
oh
my
god
he
moaned
my
brother
my
brother
dearie
think
it
it
frank
that
it
that
it
that
what
i
ca
forget
it
frank
frank
my
brother
suddenly
he
sat
up
and
his
eyes
stared
straight
into
hers
leslie
no
one
must
ever
know
what
is
in
this
letter
he
said
calmly
no
one
shall
maurice
come
let
us
burn
it
burn
it
no
no
he
cried
clutching
at
his
breast
it
must
not
be
burned
what
burn
my
brother
secret
no
no
i
must
carry
it
with
me
carry
it
with
me
to
the
grave
but
maurice
i
must
carry
it
with
me
she
saw
that
he
was
overwrought
and
so
did
not
argue
with
him
when
the
doctor
came
he
found
maurice
oakley
in
bed
but
better
the
medical
man
diagnosed
the
case
and
decided
that
he
had
received
some
severe
shock
he
feared
too
for
his
heart
for
the
patient
constantly
held
his
hands
pressed
against
his
bosom
in
vain
the
doctor
pleaded
he
would
not
take
them
down
and
when
the
wife
added
her
word
the
physician
gave
up
and
after
prescribing
left
much
puzzled
in
mind
it
a
strange
case
he
said
there
something
more
than
the
nervous
shock
that
makes
him
clutch
his
chest
like
that
and
yet
i
have
never
noticed
signs
of
heart
trouble
in
oakley
oh
well
business
worry
will
produce
anything
in
anybody
it
was
soon
common
talk
about
the
town
about
maurice
oakley
attack
in
the
seclusion
of
his
chamber
he
was
saying
to
his
wife
ah
leslie
you
and
i
will
keep
the
secret
no
one
shall
ever
know
yes
dear
but
but
what
of
berry
what
of
berry
he
cried
starting
up
excitedly
what
is
berry
to
frank
what
is
that
nigger
to
my
brother
what
are
his
sufferings
to
the
honour
of
my
family
and
name
never
mind
maurice
never
mind
you
are
right
it
must
never
be
known
i
say
if
berry
has
to
rot
in
jail
so
they
wrote
a
lie
to
frank
and
buried
the
secret
in
their
breasts
and
oakley
wore
its
visible
form
upon
his
heart
xiv
frankenstein
five
years
is
but
a
short
time
in
the
life
of
a
man
and
yet
many
things
may
happen
therein
for
instance
the
whole
way
of
a
family
life
may
be
changed
good
natures
may
be
made
into
bad
ones
and
out
of
a
soul
of
faith
grow
a
spirit
of
unbelief
the
independence
of
respectability
may
harden
into
the
insolence
of
defiance
and
the
sensitive
cheek
of
modesty
into
the
brazen
face
of
shamelessness
it
may
be
true
that
the
habits
of
years
are
hard
to
change
but
this
is
not
true
of
the
first
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
of
a
young
person
life
else
kitty
hamilton
and
joe
could
not
so
easily
have
become
what
they
were
it
had
taken
barely
five
years
to
accomplish
an
entire
metamorphosis
of
their
characters
in
joe
case
even
a
shorter
time
was
needed
he
was
so
ready
to
go
down
that
it
needed
but
a
gentle
push
to
start
him
and
once
started
there
was
nothing
within
him
to
hold
him
back
from
the
depths
for
his
will
was
as
flabby
as
his
conscience
and
his
pride
which
stands
to
some
men
for
conscience
had
no
definite
aim
or
direction
hattie
sterling
had
given
him
both
his
greatest
impulse
for
evil
and
for
good
she
had
at
first
given
him
his
gentle
push
but
when
she
saw
that
his
collapse
would
lose
her
a
faithful
and
useful
slave
she
had
sought
to
check
his
course
her
threat
of
the
severance
of
their
relations
had
held
him
up
for
a
little
time
and
she
began
to
believe
that
he
was
safe
again
he
went
back
to
the
work
he
had
neglected
drank
moderately
and
acted
in
most
things
as
a
sound
sensible
being
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
went
down
again
and
went
down
badly
she
kept
her
promise
and
threw
him
over
then
he
became
a
at
the
clubs
a
genteel
loafer
he
used
to
say
in
his
sober
moments
that
at
last
he
was
one
of
the
boys
that
sadness
had
spoken
of
he
did
not
work
and
yet
he
lived
and
ate
and
was
proud
of
his
degradation
but
he
soon
tired
of
being
separated
from
hattie
and
straightened
up
again
after
some
demur
she
received
him
upon
his
former
footing
it
was
only
for
a
few
months
he
fell
again
for
almost
four
years
this
had
happened
intermittently
finally
he
took
a
turn
for
the
better
that
endured
so
long
that
hattie
sterling
again
gave
him
her
faith
then
the
woman
made
her
mistake
she
warmed
to
him
she
showed
him
that
she
was
proud
of
him
he
went
forth
at
once
to
celebrate
his
victory
he
did
not
return
to
her
for
three
days
then
he
was
battered
unkempt
and
thick
of
speech
she
looked
at
him
in
silent
contempt
for
a
while
as
he
sat
nursing
his
aching
head
well
you
a
beauty
she
said
finally
with
cutting
scorn
you
ought
to
be
put
under
a
glass
case
and
placed
on
exhibition
he
groaned
and
his
head
sunk
lower
a
drunken
man
is
always
disarmed
his
helplessness
instead
of
inspiring
her
with
pity
inflamed
her
with
an
unfeeling
anger
that
burst
forth
in
a
volume
of
taunts
you
the
thing
i
given
up
all
my
chances
for
you
a
miserable
drunken
jay
without
a
jay
decency
no
one
had
ever
looked
at
you
until
i
picked
you
up
and
you
been
strutting
around
ever
since
showing
off
because
i
was
kind
to
you
and
now
this
is
the
way
you
pay
me
back
drunk
half
the
time
and
half
drunk
the
rest
well
you
know
what
i
told
you
the
last
time
you
got
i
mean
it
too
you
not
the
only
star
in
sight
see
she
laughed
meanly
and
began
to
sing
you
have
to
find
another
baby
now
for
the
first
time
he
looked
up
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
tears
both
of
grief
and
intoxication
there
was
an
expression
of
a
whipped
dog
on
his
face
do
do
he
pleaded
stretching
out
his
hands
to
her
her
eyes
blazed
back
at
him
but
she
sang
on
insolently
tauntingly
the
very
inanity
of
the
man
disgusted
her
and
on
a
sudden
impulse
she
sprang
up
and
struck
him
full
in
the
face
with
the
flat
of
her
hand
he
was
too
weak
to
resist
the
blow
and
tumbling
from
the
chair
fell
limply
to
the
floor
where
he
lay
at
her
feet
alternately
weeping
aloud
and
quivering
with
drunken
hiccoughing
sobs
get
up
she
cried
get
up
and
get
out
o
here
you
lay
around
my
house
he
had
already
begun
to
fall
into
a
drunken
sleep
but
she
shook
him
got
him
to
his
feet
and
pushed
him
outside
the
door
now
go
you
drunken
dog
and
never
put
your
foot
inside
this
house
again
he
stood
outside
swaying
dizzily
upon
his
feet
and
looking
back
with
dazed
eyes
at
the
door
then
he
muttered
pu
me
out
wi
you
pu
me
out
damn
you
well
i
ki
you
see
i
do
and
he
half
walked
half
fell
down
the
street
sadness
and
skaggsy
were
together
at
the
club
that
night
five
years
had
not
changed
the
latter
as
to
wealth
or
position
or
inclination
and
he
was
still
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
banner
he
always
came
in
alone
now
for
maudie
had
gone
the
way
of
all
the
and
reached
depths
to
which
skaggs
job
prevented
him
from
following
her
however
he
mourned
truly
for
his
lost
companion
and
he
was
in
a
particularly
pensive
mood
some
one
was
playing
on
the
piano
and
the
dancers
were
wheeling
in
time
to
the
music
skaggsy
looked
at
them
regretfully
as
he
sipped
his
liquor
it
made
him
think
of
maudie
he
sighed
and
turned
away
i
tell
you
sadness
he
said
impulsively
dancing
is
the
poetry
of
motion
yes
replied
sadness
and
dancing
in
is
the
dialect
poetry
the
reporter
did
not
like
this
it
savoured
of
flippancy
and
he
was
about
entering
upon
a
discussion
to
prove
that
sadness
had
no
soul
when
joe
with
eyes
and
dishevelled
clothes
staggered
in
and
reeled
towards
them
drunk
again
said
sadness
really
it
a
waste
of
time
for
joe
to
sober
up
hullo
there
as
the
young
man
brought
up
against
him

a
seat

chair

old
sadness

he
paused
and
looked
at
them
drowsily
then
bracing
himself
up
again
he
broke
out
suddenly
say

ever
tell
the
ol
man

never

threatened

exclaimed

for
my
paper
and
if
this
story
is
one
i
a
made
man
the
drink
seemed
to
revive
the
young
man
again
and
by
bits
skaggs
was
able
to
pick
out
of
him
the
story
of
his
father
arrest
and
conviction
at
its
close
he
relapsed
into
stupidity
murmuring
she
throwed
me
down
well
sneered
sadness
you
see
drunken
men
tell
the
truth
and
you
do
seem
to
get
much
guilt
out
of
our
young
friend
you
disappointed
are
you
i
confess
i
am
disappointed
but
i
got
an
idea
just
the
same
oh
you
have
well
do
handle
it
carelessly
it
might
go
off
and
sadness
rose
the
reporter
sat
thinking
for
a
time
and
then
followed
him
leaving
joe
in
a
drunken
sleep
at
the
table
there
he
lay
for
more
than
two
hours
when
he
finally
awoke
he
started
up
as
if
some
determination
had
come
to
him
in
his
sleep
a
part
of
the
helplessness
of
his
intoxication
had
gone
but
his
first
act
was
to
call
for
more
whiskey
this
he
gulped
down
and
followed
with
another
and
another
for
a
while
he
stood
still
brooding
silently
his
red
eyes
blinking
at
the
light
then
he
turned
abruptly
and
left
the
club
it
was
very
late
when
he
reached
hattie
door
but
he
opened
it
with
his
as
he
had
been
used
to
do
he
stopped
to
help
himself
to
a
glass
of
brandy
as
he
had
so
often
done
before
then
he
went
directly
to
her
room
she
was
a
light
sleeper
and
his
step
awakened
her
who
is
it
she
cried
in
affright
it
me
his
voice
was
steadier
now
but
grim
what
do
you
want
did
i
tell
you
never
to
come
here
again
get
out
or
i
have
you
taken
out
she
sprang
up
in
bed
glaring
angrily
at
him
his
hands
twitched
nervously
as
if
her
will
were
conquering
him
and
he
were
uneasy
but
he
held
her
eye
with
his
own
you
put
me
out
he
said
yes
and
i
going
to
do
it
again
you
drunk
she
started
to
rise
but
he
took
a
step
towards
her
and
she
paused
he
looked
as
she
had
never
seen
him
look
before
his
face
was
ashen
and
his
eyes
like
fire
and
blood
she
quailed
beneath
the
look
he
took
another
step
towards
her
you
put
me
out
he
repeated
like
a
dog
his
step
was
steady
and
his
tone
was
clear
menacingly
clear
she
shrank
back
from
him
back
to
the
wall
still
his
hands
twitched
and
his
eye
held
her
still
he
crept
slowly
towards
her
his
lips
working
and
his
hands
moving
convulsively
joe
joe
she
said
hoarsely
what
the
matter
oh
do
look
at
me
like
that
the
gown
had
fallen
away
from
her
breast
and
showed
the
convulsive
fluttering
of
her
heart
he
broke
into
a
laugh
a
dry
murderous
laugh
and
his
hands
sought
each
other
while
the
fingers
twitched
over
one
another
like
coiling
serpents
you
put
me
out
you
you
and
you
made
me
what
i
am
the
realisation
of
what
he
was
of
his
foulness
and
degradation
seemed
just
to
have
come
to
him
fully
you
made
me
what
i
am
and
then
you
sent
me
away
you
let
me
come
back
and
now
you
put
me
out
she
gazed
at
him
fascinated
she
tried
to
scream
and
she
could
not
this
was
not
joe
this
was
not
the
boy
that
she
had
turned
and
twisted
about
her
little
finger
this
was
a
terrible
terrible
man
or
a
monster
he
moved
a
step
nearer
her
his
eyes
fell
to
her
throat
for
an
instant
she
lost
their
steady
glare
and
then
she
found
her
voice
the
scream
was
checked
as
it
began
his
fingers
had
closed
over
her
throat
just
where
the
gown
had
left
it
temptingly
bare
they
gave
it
the
caress
of
death
she
struggled
they
held
her
her
eyes
prayed
to
his
but
his
were
the
fire
of
hell
she
fell
back
upon
her
pillow
in
silence
he
had
not
uttered
a
word
he
held
her
finally
he
flung
her
from
him
like
a
rag
and
sank
into
a
chair
and
there
the
officers
found
him
when
hattie
sterling
disappearance
had
become
a
strange
thing
xv
dear
damned
delightful
town
when
joe
was
taken
there
was
no
spirit
or
feeling
left
in
him
he
moved
mechanically
as
if
without
sense
or
volition
the
first
impression
he
gave
was
that
of
a
man
insanity
but
this
was
soon
removed
by
the
very
indifference
with
which
he
met
everything
concerned
with
his
crime
from
the
very
first
he
made
no
effort
to
exonerate
or
to
vindicate
himself
he
talked
little
and
only
in
a
dry
stupefied
way
he
was
as
one
whose
soul
is
dead
and
perhaps
it
was
for
all
the
little
soul
of
him
had
been
wrapped
up
in
the
body
of
this
one
woman
and
the
stroke
that
took
her
life
had
killed
him
too
the
men
who
examined
him
were
irritated
beyond
measure
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
exercise
their
ingenuity
upon
he
left
them
nothing
to
search
for
their
most
damning
question
he
answered
with
an
apathy
that
showed
absolutely
no
interest
in
the
matter
it
was
as
if
some
one
whom
he
did
not
care
about
had
committed
a
crime
and
he
had
been
called
to
testify
the
only
thing
which
he
noticed
or
seemed
to
have
any
affection
for
was
a
little
pet
dog
which
had
been
hers
and
which
they
sometimes
allowed
to
be
with
him
after
the
life
sentence
had
been
passed
upon
him
and
when
he
was
awaiting
removal
he
would
sit
for
hours
with
the
little
animal
in
his
lap
caressing
it
dumbly
there
was
a
mute
sorrow
in
the
eyes
of
both
man
and
dog
and
they
seemed
to
take
comfort
in
each
other
presence
there
was
no
need
of
any
sign
between
them
they
had
both
loved
her
had
they
not
so
they
understood
sadness
saw
him
and
came
back
to
the
banner
torn
and
unnerved
by
the
sight
i
saw
him
he
said
with
a
shudder
and
it
take
more
whiskey
than
jack
can
give
me
in
a
year
to
wash
the
memory
of
him
out
of
me
why
man
it
shocked
me
all
through
it
a
pity
they
did
send
him
to
the
chair
it
could
have
done
him
much
harm
and
would
have
been
a
real
mercy
and
so
sadness
and
all
the
club
with
a
muttered
poor
devil
dismissed
him
he
was
gone
why
should
they
worry
only
one
more
who
had
got
into
the
whirlpool
enjoyed
the
sensation
for
a
moment
and
then
swept
dizzily
down
there
were
indeed
some
who
for
an
earnest
hour
sermonised
about
it
and
said
here
is
another
example
of
the
pernicious
influence
of
the
city
on
untrained
negroes
oh
is
there
no
way
to
keep
these
people
from
rushing
away
from
the
small
villages
and
country
districts
of
the
south
up
to
the
cities
where
they
can
not
battle
with
the
terrible
force
of
a
strange
and
unusual
environment
is
there
no
way
to
prove
to
them
that
simplicity
is
infinitely
better
than
degradation
they
wanted
to
preach
to
these
people
that
good
agriculture
is
better
than
bad
art
that
it
was
better
and
nobler
for
them
to
sing
to
god
across
the
southern
fields
than
to
dance
for
rowdies
in
the
northern
halls
they
wanted
to
dare
to
say
that
the
south
has
its
faults
no
one
condones
them
and
its
disadvantages
but
that
even
what
they
suffered
from
these
was
better
than
what
awaited
them
in
the
great
alleys
of
new
york
down
there
the
bodies
were
restrained
and
they
chafed
but
here
the
soul
would
fester
and
they
would
be
content
this
was
but
for
an
hour
for
even
while
they
exclaimed
they
knew
that
there
was
no
way
and
that
the
stream
of
young
negro
life
would
continue
to
flow
up
from
the
south
dashing
itself
against
the
hard
necessities
of
the
city
and
breaking
like
waves
against
a
rock
that
until
the
gods
grew
tired
of
their
cruel
sport
there
must
still
be
sacrifices
to
false
ideals
and
unreal
ambitions
there
was
one
heart
though
that
neither
dismissed
joe
with
gratuitous
pity
nor
sermonised
about
him
the
mother
heart
had
only
room
for
grief
and
pain
already
it
had
borne
its
share
it
had
known
sorrow
for
a
lost
husband
tears
at
the
neglect
and
brutality
of
a
new
companion
shame
for
a
daughter
sake
and
it
had
seemed
already
filled
to
overflowing
and
yet
the
fates
had
put
in
this
one
other
burden
until
it
seemed
it
must
burst
with
the
weight
of
it
to
fannie
hamilton
mind
now
all
her
boy
shortcomings
became
as
naught
he
was
not
her
wayward
erring
criminal
son
she
only
remembered
that
he
was
her
son
and
wept
for
him
as
such
she
forgot
his
curses
while
her
memory
went
back
to
the
sweetness
of
his
baby
prattle
and
the
soft
words
of
his
tenderer
youth
until
the
last
she
clung
to
him
holding
him
guiltless
and
to
her
thought
they
took
to
prison
not
joe
hamilton
a
convicted
criminal
but
joey
joey
her
boy
her
firstborn
a
martyr
the
pretty
miss
kitty
hamilton
was
less
deeply
impressed
the
arrest
and
subsequent
conviction
of
her
brother
was
quite
a
blow
she
felt
the
shame
of
it
keenly
and
some
of
the
grief
to
her
coming
as
it
did
just
at
a
time
when
the
company
was
being
strengthened
and
she
more
importantly
featured
than
ever
it
was
decidedly
inopportune
for
no
one
could
help
connecting
her
name
with
the
affair
for
a
long
time
she
and
her
brother
had
scarcely
been
upon
speaking
terms
during
joe
frequent
lapses
from
industry
he
had
been
prone
to
touch
his
sister
for
the
wherewithal
to
supply
his
various
wants
when
finally
she
grew
tired
and
refused
to
be
touched
he
rebuked
her
for
withholding
that
which
save
for
his
help
she
would
never
have
been
able
to
make
this
went
on
until
they
were
almost
entirely
estranged
he
was
wont
to
say
that
now
his
sister
was
up
in
the
world
she
had
got
the
big
head
and
she
to
retort
that
her
brother
wanted
to
use
her
for
a
thing
from
the
time
that
she
went
on
the
stage
she
had
begun
to
live
her
own
life
a
life
in
which
the
chief
aim
was
the
possession
of
good
clothes
and
the
ability
to
attract
the
attention
which
she
had
learned
to
crave
the
greatest
sign
of
interest
she
showed
in
her
brother
affair
was
at
first
to
offer
her
mother
money
to
secure
a
lawyer
but
when
joe
confessed
all
she
consoled
herself
with
the
reflection
that
perhaps
it
was
for
the
best
and
kept
her
money
in
her
pocket
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
she
was
getting
to
be
so
very
much
more
joe
sister
she
did
not
go
to
see
her
brother
she
was
afraid
it
might
make
her
nervous
while
she
was
in
the
city
and
she
went
on
the
road
with
her
company
before
he
was
taken
away
miss
kitty
hamilton
had
to
be
very
careful
about
her
nerves
and
her
health
she
had
had
experiences
and
her
voice
was
not
as
good
as
it
used
to
be
and
her
beauty
had
to
be
aided
by
cosmetics
so
she
went
away
from
new
york
and
only
read
of
all
that
happened
when
some
one
called
her
attention
to
it
in
the
papers
berry
hamilton
in
his
southern
prison
knew
nothing
of
all
this
for
no
letters
had
passed
between
him
and
his
family
for
more
than
two
years
the
very
cruelty
of
destiny
defeated
itself
in
this
and
was
kind
xvi
skaggs
theory
there
was
perhaps
more
depth
to
skaggs
than
most
people
gave
him
credit
for
having
however
it
may
be
when
he
got
an
idea
into
his
head
whether
it
were
insane
or
otherwise
he
had
a
decidedly
tenacious
way
of
holding
to
it
sadness
had
been
disposed
to
laugh
at
him
when
he
announced
that
joe
drunken
story
of
his
father
troubles
had
given
him
an
idea
but
it
was
nevertheless
true
and
that
idea
had
stayed
with
him
clear
through
the
exciting
events
that
followed
on
that
fatal
night
he
thought
and
dreamed
of
it
until
he
had
made
a
working
theory
then
one
day
with
a
boldness
that
he
seldom
assumed
when
in
the
sacred
presence
he
walked
into
the
office
and
laid
his
plans
before
the
editor
they
talked
together
for
some
time
and
the
editor
seemed
hard
to
convince
it
would
be
a
big
thing
for
the
paper
he
said
if
it
only
panned
out
but
it
is
such
a
thing
no
one
under
the
sun
would
have
thought
of
it
but
you
skaggs
oh
it
bound
to
pan
out
i
see
the
thing
as
clear
as
day
there
no
getting
around
it
yes
it
looks
plausible
but
so
does
all
fiction
you
taking
a
chance
you
losing
time
if
it
fails
but
if
it
succeeds
well
go
and
bring
back
a
story
if
you
do
look
out
it
against
my
better
judgment
anyway
remember
i
told
you
that
skaggs
shot
out
of
the
office
and
within
an
hour
and
a
half
had
boarded
a
fast
train
for
the
south
it
is
almost
a
question
whether
skaggs
had
a
theory
or
whether
he
had
told
himself
a
pretty
story
and
as
usual
believed
it
the
editor
was
right
no
one
else
would
have
thought
of
the
wild
thing
that
was
in
the
reporter
mind
the
detective
had
not
thought
of
it
five
years
before
nor
had
maurice
oakley
and
his
friends
had
an
inkling
and
here
was
one
of
the
new
york
young
men
going
miles
to
prove
his
idea
about
something
that
did
not
at
all
concern
him
when
skaggs
reached
the
town
which
had
been
the
home
of
the
hamiltons
he
went
at
once
to
the
continental
hotel
he
had
as
yet
formulated
no
plan
of
immediate
action
and
with
a
fool
or
a
genius
belief
in
his
destiny
he
sat
down
to
await
the
turn
of
events
his
first
move
would
be
to
get
acquainted
with
some
of
his
neighbours
this
was
no
difficult
matter
as
the
bar
of
the
continental
was
still
the
of
some
of
the
city
choice
spirits
of
the
old
regime
thither
he
went
and
his
convivial
cheerfulness
soon
placed
him
on
terms
of
equality
with
many
of
his
kind
he
insinuated
that
he
was
looking
around
for
business
prospects
this
proved
his
five
years
had
not
changed
the
continental
frequenters
much
and
skaggs
intention
immediately
brought
beachfield
davis
down
upon
him
with
the
remark
if
a
man
wants
to
go
into
business
business
for
a
gentleman
suh
gad
there
no
finer
or
better
paying
business
in
the
world
than
breeding
blooded
dogs
that
is
if
you
get
a
man
of
experience
to
go
in
with
you
dogs
dogs
drivelled
old
horace
talbot
beachfield
always
talking
about
dogs
i
remember
the
night
we
were
all
discussing
that
hamilton
nigger
arrest
beachfield
said
it
was
a
sign
of
total
depravity
because
his
man
hunted
with
his
hound
the
old
man
laughed
inanely
the
hotel
whiskey
was
getting
on
his
nerves
the
reporter
opened
his
eyes
and
his
ears
he
had
stumbled
upon
something
at
any
rate
what
was
it
about
some
nigger
arrest
sir
he
asked
respectfully
oh
it
was
anything
much
only
an
old
and
trusted
servant
robbed
his
master
and
my
theory
but
you
will
remember
talbot
broke
in
davis
that
i
proved
your
theory
to
be
wrong
and
cited
a
conclusive
instance
yes
a
dog
i
am
really
anxious
to
hear
about
the
robbery
though
it
seems
such
an
unusual
thing
for
a
negro
to
steal
a
great
amount
just
so
and
that
was
part
of
my
theory
now
it
an
old
story
and
a
long
one
skaggs
and
one
of
merely
local
repute
interjected
colonel
saunders
i
do
think
it
could
possibly
interest
you
who
are
familiar
with
the
records
of
the
really
great
crimes
that
take
place
in
a
city
such
as
new
york
those
things
do
interest
me
very
much
though
i
am
something
of
a
psychologist
and
i
often
find
the
smallest
and
most
details
pregnant
with
suggestion
wo
you
let
me
hear
the
story
colonel
why
yes
though
there
little
in
it
save
that
i
am
one
of
the
few
men
who
have
come
to
believe
that
the
negro
berry
hamilton
is
not
the
guilty
party
nonsense
nonsense
said
talbot
of
course
berry
was
guilty
but
as
i
said
before
i
do
blame
him
the
negroes
total
depravity
said
davis
now
look
at
my
dog
if
you
will
retire
with
me
to
the
further
table
i
will
give
you
whatever
of
the
facts
i
can
call
to
mind
as
unobtrusively
as
they
could
they
drew
apart
from
the
others
and
seated
themselves
at
a
more
secluded
table
leaving
talbot
and
davis
wrangling
as
of
old
over
their
theories
when
the
glasses
were
filled
and
the
pipes
going
the
colonel
began
his
story
interlarding
it
frequently
with
comments
of
his
own
now
in
the
first
place
skaggs
he
said
when
the
tale
was
done
i
am
lawyer
enough
to
see
for
myself
how
weak
the
evidence
was
upon
which
the
negro
was
convicted
and
later
events
have
done
much
to
confirm
me
in
the
opinion
that
he
was
innocent
later
events
yes
the
colonel
leaned
across
the
table
and
his
voice
fell
to
a
whisper
four
years
ago
a
great
change
took
place
in
maurice
oakley
it
happened
in
the
space
of
a
day
and
no
one
knows
the
cause
of
it
from
a
social
companionable
man
he
became
a
recluse
shunning
visitors
and
dreading
society
from
an
unsuspicious
neighbour
he
became
secretive
and
distrustful
of
his
own
friends
from
an
active
business
man
he
has
become
a
retired
brooder
he
sees
no
one
if
he
can
help
it
he
writes
no
letters
and
receives
none
not
even
from
his
brother
it
is
said
and
all
of
this
came
about
in
the
space
of
hours
but
what
was
the
beginning
of
it
no
one
knows
save
that
one
day
he
had
some
sort
of
nervous
attack
by
the
time
the
doctor
was
called
he
was
better
but
he
kept
clutching
his
hand
over
his
heart
naturally
the
physician
wanted
to
examine
him
there
but
the
very
suggestion
of
it
seemed
to
throw
him
into
a
frenzy
and
his
wife
too
begged
the
doctor
an
old
friend
of
the
family
to
desist
maurice
oakley
had
been
as
sound
as
a
dollar
and
no
one
of
the
family
had
had
any
tendency
to
heart
affection
it
is
strange
strange
it
is
but
i
have
my
theory
his
actions
are
like
those
of
a
man
guarding
a
secret
sh
his
negro
laundress
says
that
there
is
an
inside
pocket
in
his
undershirts
an
inside
pocket
yes
and
for
what
skaggs
was
trembling
with
eagerness
the
colonel
dropped
his
voice
lower
we
can
only
speculate
he
said
but
as
i
have
said
i
have
my
theory
oakley
was
a
just
man
and
in
punishing
his
old
servant
for
the
supposed
robbery
it
is
plain
that
he
acted
from
principle
but
he
is
also
a
proud
man
and
would
hate
to
confess
that
he
had
been
in
the
wrong
so
i
believed
that
the
cause
of
his
first
shock
was
the
finding
of
the
money
that
he
supposed
gone
unwilling
to
admit
this
error
he
lets
the
misapprehension
go
on
and
it
is
the
money
which
he
carries
in
his
secret
pocket
with
a
morbid
fear
of
its
discovery
that
has
made
him
dismiss
his
servants
leave
his
business
and
refuse
to
see
his
friends
a
very
natural
conclusion
colonel
and
i
must
say
that
i
believe
you
it
is
strange
that
others
have
not
seen
as
you
have
seen
and
brought
the
matter
to
light
well
you
see
skaggs
none
are
so
dull
as
the
people
who
think
they
think
i
can
safely
say
that
there
is
not
another
man
in
this
town
who
has
lighted
upon
the
real
solution
of
this
matter
though
it
has
been
openly
talked
of
for
so
long
but
as
for
bringing
it
to
light
no
one
would
think
of
doing
that
it
would
be
sure
to
hurt
feelings
and
he
is
of
one
of
our
best
families
ah
yes
perfectly
right
skaggs
had
got
all
that
he
wanted
much
more
in
fact
than
he
had
expected
the
colonel
held
him
for
a
while
yet
to
enlarge
upon
the
views
that
he
had
expressed
when
the
reporter
finally
left
him
it
was
with
a
cheery
colonel
if
i
were
a
criminal
i
should
be
afraid
of
that
analytical
mind
of
yours
he
went
upstairs
chuckling
the
old
fool
he
cried
as
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
i
got
it
i
got
it
maurice
oakley
must
see
me
and
then
what
he
sat
down
to
think
out
what
he
should
do
again
with
his
fine
disregard
of
ways
and
means
he
determined
to
trust
to
luck
and
as
he
expressed
it
brace
old
oakley
accordingly
he
went
about
nine
the
next
morning
to
house
a
woman
inquired
his
errand
i
want
to
see
oakley
he
said
you
can
not
see
him
oakley
is
not
well
and
does
not
see
visitors
but
i
must
see
him
madam
i
am
here
upon
business
of
importance
you
can
tell
me
just
as
well
as
him
i
am
his
wife
and
transact
all
of
his
business
i
can
tell
no
one
but
the
master
of
the
house
himself
you
can
not
see
him
it
is
against
his
orders
very
well
replied
skaggs
descending
one
step
it
is
his
loss
not
mine
i
have
tried
to
do
my
duty
and
failed
simply
tell
him
that
i
came
from
paris
paris
cried
a
querulous
voice
behind
the
woman
back
leslie
why
do
you
keep
the
gentleman
at
the
door
let
him
come
in
at
once
oakley
stepped
from
the
door
and
skaggs
went
in
had
he
seen
oakley
before
he
would
have
been
shocked
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
but
as
it
was
the
nervous
man
who
stood
shiftily
before
him
told
him
nothing
of
an
eating
secret
long
carried
the
man
face
was
gray
and
haggard
and
deep
lines
were
cut
under
his
staring
eyes
his
hair
tumbled
in
white
masses
over
his
pallid
forehead
and
his
lips
twitched
as
he
talked
you
from
paris
sir
from
paris
he
said
come
in
come
in
his
motions
were
nervous
and
erratic
skaggs
followed
him
into
the
library
and
the
wife
disappeared
in
another
direction
it
would
have
been
hard
to
recognise
in
the
oakley
of
the
present
the
man
of
a
few
years
before
the
strong
frame
had
gone
away
to
bone
and
nothing
of
his
old
power
sat
on
either
brow
or
chin
he
was
as
a
man
who
trembled
on
the
brink
of
insanity
his
guilty
secret
had
been
too
much
for
him
and
skaggs
own
fingers
twitched
as
he
saw
his
host
hands
seek
the
breast
of
his
jacket
every
other
moment
it
is
there
the
secret
is
hidden
he
said
to
himself
and
whatever
it
is
i
must
have
it
but
how
how
i
ca
knock
the
man
down
and
rob
him
in
his
own
house
but
oakley
himself
proceeded
to
give
him
his
first
cue
you
you
perhaps
have
a
message
from
my
brother
my
brother
who
is
in
paris
i
have
not
heard
from
him
for
some
time
skaggs
mind
worked
quickly
he
remembered
the
colonel
story
evidently
the
brother
had
something
to
do
with
the
secret
now
or
never
he
thought
so
he
said
boldly
yes
i
have
a
message
from
your
brother
the
man
sprung
up
clutching
again
at
his
breast
you
have
you
have
give
it
to
me
after
four
years
he
sends
me
a
message
give
it
to
me
the
reporter
looked
steadily
at
the
man
he
knew
that
he
was
in
his
power
that
his
very
eagerness
would
prove
traitor
to
his
discretion
your
brother
bade
me
to
say
to
you
that
you
have
a
terrible
secret
that
you
bear
it
in
your
breast
there
there
i
am
his
messenger
he
bids
you
to
give
it
to
me
oakley
had
shrunken
back
as
if
he
had
been
struck
no
no
he
gasped
no
no
i
have
no
secret
the
reporter
moved
nearer
him
the
old
man
shrunk
against
the
wall
his
lips
working
convulsively
and
his
hand
tearing
at
his
breast
as
skaggs
drew
nearer
he
attempted
to
shriek
but
his
voice
was
husky
and
broke
off
in
a
gasping
whisper
give
it
to
me
as
your
brother
commands
no
no
no
it
is
not
his
secret
it
is
mine
i
must
carry
it
here
always
do
you
hear
i
must
carry
it
till
i
die
go
away
go
away
skaggs
seized
him
oakley
struggled
weakly
but
he
had
no
strength
the
reporter
hand
sought
the
secret
pocket
he
felt
a
paper
beneath
his
fingers
oakley
gasped
hoarsely
as
he
drew
it
forth
then
raising
his
voice
gave
one
agonised
cry
and
sank
to
the
floor
frothing
at
the
mouth
at
the
cry
rapid
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
hallway
and
oakley
threw
open
the
door
what
is
the
matter
she
cried
my
message
has
somewhat
upset
your
husband
was
the
cool
answer
but
his
breast
is
open
your
hand
has
been
in
his
bosom
you
have
taken
something
from
him
give
it
to
me
or
i
shall
call
for
help
skaggs
had
not
reckoned
on
this
but
his
wits
came
to
the
rescue
you
dare
not
call
for
help
he
said
or
the
world
will
know
she
wrung
her
hands
helplessly
crying
oh
give
it
to
me
give
it
to
me
we
never
done
you
any
harm
but
you
harmed
some
one
else
that
is
enough
he
moved
towards
the
door
but
she
sprang
in
front
of
him
with
the
fierceness
of
a
tigress
protecting
her
young
she
attacked
him
with
teeth
and
nails
she
was
pallid
with
fury
and
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
protect
himself
and
yet
not
injure
her
finally
when
her
anger
had
taken
her
strength
he
succeeded
in
getting
out
he
flew
down
the
and
out
of
the
front
door
the
woman
screams
following
him
he
did
not
pause
to
read
the
precious
letter
until
he
was
safe
in
his
room
at
the
continental
hotel
then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
crying
thank
god
thank
god
i
was
right
and
the
shall
have
a
sensation
the
brother
is
the
thief
and
berry
hamilton
is
an
innocent
man
hurrah
now
who
is
it
that
has
come
on
a
chase

that

to
handle
his
idea
carefully
heigho

the
drinks

and
old
skaggsy
will
have
done
some
good
in
the
world
xvii
a
yellow
journal
skaggs
had
no
qualms
of
conscience
about
the
manner
in
which
he
had
come
by
the
damaging
evidence
against
maurice
oakley
it
was
enough
for
him
that
he
had
it
a
corporation
he
argued
had
no
soul
and
therefore
no
conscience
how
much
less
then
should
so
small
a
part
of
a
great
corporation
as
himself
be
expected
to
have
them
he
had
his
story
it
was
vivid
interesting
dramatic
it
meant
the
favour
of
his
editor
a
big
thing
for
the
and
a
fatter
lining
for
his
own
pocket
he
sat
down
to
put
his
discovery
on
paper
before
he
attempted
anything
else
although
the
impulse
to
celebrate
was
very
strong
within
him
he
told
his
story
well
with
an
eye
to
every
one
of
its
salient
points
he
sent
an
alleged
picture
of
berry
hamilton
as
he
had
appeared
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
he
sent
a
picture
of
the
oakley
home
and
of
the
cottage
where
the
servant
and
his
family
had
been
so
happy
there
was
a
strong
of
the
man
oakley
grown
haggard
and
morose
from
carrying
his
guilty
secret
of
his
confusion
when
confronted
with
the
supposed
knowledge
of
it
the
old
southern
city
was
described
and
the
opinions
of
its
residents
in
regard
to
the
case
given
it
was
there
clear
interesting
and
strong
one
could
see
it
all
as
if
every
phase
of
it
were
being
enacted
before
one
eyes
skaggs
surpassed
himself
when
the
editor
first
got
hold
of
it
he
said
huh
over
the
opening
lines
a
few
short
sentences
that
instantly
pricked
the
attention
awake
he
read
on
with
increasing
interest
this
is
good
stuff
he
said
at
the
last
page
here
a
chance
for
the
to
look
into
the
methods
of
southern
court
proceedings
here
a
chance
for
a
spread
the
had
always
claimed
to
be
the
friend
of
all
poor
and
oppressed
humanity
and
every
once
in
a
while
it
did
something
to
substantiate
its
claim
whereupon
it
stood
off
and
said
to
the
public
look
you
what
we
have
done
and
behold
how
great
we
are
the
friend
of
the
people
the
was
yellow
it
was
very
so
but
it
had
power
and
keenness
and
energy
it
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
crow
and
if
one
was
not
forthcoming
it
made
one
in
this
way
it
managed
to
do
a
considerable
amount
of
good
and
its
yellowness
became
forgivable
even
commendable
in
skaggs
story
the
editor
saw
an
opportunity
for
one
of
its
periodical
philanthropies
he
seized
upon
it
with
headlines
that
took
half
a
page
and
with
cuts
authentic
and
otherwise
the
tale
was
told
and
the
people
of
new
york
were
greeted
next
morning
with
the
announcement
of
a
burning
shame
a
poor
and
innocent
negro
made
to
suffer
for
a
rich
man
crime
great
expose
by
the
a
reporter
to
the
rescue
the
whole
thing
to
be
aired
that
the
people
may
know
then
skaggs
received
a
telegram
that
made
him
leap
for
joy
he
was
to
do
it
he
was
to
go
to
the
capital
of
the
state
he
was
to
beard
the
governor
in
his
den
and
he
with
the
force
of
a
great
paper
behind
him
was
to
demand
for
the
people
the
release
of
an
innocent
man
then
there
would
be
another
and
much
glory
for
him
and
more
shekels
in
an
hour
after
he
had
received
his
telegram
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
southern
capital
meanwhile
in
the
house
of
maurice
oakley
there
were
sad
times
from
the
moment
that
the
master
of
the
house
had
fallen
to
the
floor
in
impotent
fear
and
madness
there
had
been
no
peace
within
his
doors
at
first
his
wife
had
tried
to
control
him
alone
and
had
humoured
the
wild
babblings
with
which
he
woke
from
his
swoon
but
these
changed
to
shrieks
and
cries
and
curses
and
she
was
forced
to
throw
open
the
doors
so
long
closed
and
call
in
help
the
neighbours
and
her
old
friends
went
to
her
assistance
and
what
the
reporter
story
had
not
done
the
ravings
of
the
man
accomplished
for
with
a
show
of
matchless
cunning
he
continually
clutched
at
his
breast
laughed
and
babbled
his
secret
openly
even
then
they
would
have
smothered
it
in
silence
for
the
honour
of
one
of
their
best
families
but
too
many
ears
had
heard
and
then
came
the
yellow
journal
bearing
all
the
news
in
emblazoned
headlines
colonel
saunders
was
distinctly
hurt
to
think
that
his
confidence
had
been
imposed
on
and
that
he
had
been
instrumental
in
bringing
shame
upon
a
southern
name
to
think
suh
he
said
generally
to
the
usual
assembly
of
choice
spirits
to
think
of
that
man
being
a
reporter
suh
a
common
ordinary
reporter
and
that
i
sat
and
talked
to
him
as
if
he
were
a
gentleman
you
not
to
be
blamed
colonel
said
old
horace
talbot
you
done
no
more
than
any
other
gentleman
would
have
done
the
trouble
is
that
the
average
northerner
has
no
sense
of
honour
suh
no
sense
of
honour
if
this
particular
man
had
had
he
would
have
kept
still
and
everything
would
have
gone
on
smooth
and
quiet
instead
of
that
a
distinguished
family
is
brought
to
shame
and
for
what
to
give
a
nigger
a
few
more
years
of
freedom
when
likely
as
not
he
do
want
it
and
berry
hamilton
life
in
prison
has
proved
nearer
the
ideal
reached
by
slavery
than
anything
he
has
found
since
emancipation
why
suhs
i
fancy
i
see
him
leaving
his
prison
with
tears
of
regret
in
his
eyes
old
horace
was
inanely
eloquent
for
an
hour
over
his
pet
theory
but
there
were
some
in
the
town
who
thought
differently
about
the
matter
and
it
was
their
opinions
and
murmurings
that
backed
up
skaggs
and
made
it
easier
for
him
when
at
the
capital
he
came
into
contact
with
the
official
red
tape
he
was
told
that
there
were
certain
forms
of
procedure
and
certain
times
for
certain
things
but
he
hammered
persistently
away
the
murmurings
behind
him
grew
louder
while
from
his
sanctum
the
editor
of
the
thundered
away
against
oppression
and
tyranny
other
papers
took
it
up
and
asked
why
this
man
should
be
despoiled
of
his
liberty
any
longer
and
when
it
was
replied
that
the
man
had
been
convicted
and
that
the
wheels
of
justice
could
not
be
stopped
or
turned
back
by
the
letter
of
a
romantic
artist
or
the
ravings
of
a
madman
there
was
a
mighty
outcry
against
the
farce
of
justice
that
had
been
played
out
in
this
man
case
the
trial
was
reviewed
the
evidence
again
brought
up
and
examined
the
dignity
of
the
state
was
threatened
at
this
time
the
state
did
the
one
thing
necessary
to
save
its
tottering
reputation
it
would
not
surrender
but
it
capitulated
and
berry
hamilton
was
pardoned
berry
heard
the
news
with
surprise
and
a
joy
he
had
long
ago
lost
hope
that
justice
would
ever
be
done
to
him
he
marvelled
at
the
word
that
was
brought
to
him
now
and
he
could
not
understand
the
strange
cordiality
of
the
young
white
man
who
met
him
at
the
office
five
years
of
prison
life
had
made
a
different
man
of
him
he
no
longer
looked
to
receive
kindness
from
his
fellows
and
he
blinked
at
it
as
he
blinked
at
the
unwonted
brightness
of
the
sun
the
lines
about
his
mouth
where
the
smiles
used
to
gather
had
changed
and
grown
stern
with
the
hopelessness
of
years
his
lips
drooped
pathetically
and
hard
treatment
had
given
his
eyes
a
lowering
look
his
hair
that
had
hardly
shown
a
white
streak
was
as
white
as
maurice
oakley
own
his
erstwhile
quick
wits
were
dulled
and
imbruted
he
had
lived
like
an
ox
working
without
inspiration
or
reward
and
he
came
forth
like
an
ox
from
his
stall
all
the
higher
part
of
him
he
had
left
behind
dropping
it
off
day
after
day
through
the
wearisome
years
he
had
put
behind
him
the
berry
hamilton
that
laughed
and
joked
and
sang
and
believed
for
even
his
faith
had
become
only
a
numbed
fancy
this
is
a
very
happy
occasion
hamilton
said
skaggs
shaking
his
hand
heartily
berry
did
not
answer
what
had
this
slim
glib
young
man
to
do
with
him
what
had
any
white
man
to
do
with
him
after
what
he
had
suffered
at
their
hands
you
know
you
are
to
go
new
york
with
me
to
new
yawk
what
fu
skaggs
did
not
tell
him
that
now
that
the
had
done
its
work
it
demanded
the
right
to
crow
to
its
heart
satisfaction
he
said
only
you
want
to
see
your
wife
of
course
berry
had
forgotten
fannie
and
for
the
first
time
his
heart
thrilled
within
him
at
the
thought
of
seeing
her
again
i
ai
hyeahed
my
people
fu
a
long
time
i
did
know
what
had
become
of
how
kit
an
joe
they
all
right
was
the
reply
skaggs
could
tell
him
in
this
the
first
hour
of
his
freedom
let
him
have
time
to
drink
the
sweetness
of
that
all
in
there
would
be
time
afterwards
to
taste
all
of
the
bitterness
once
in
new
york
he
found
that
people
wished
to
see
him
some
fools
some
philanthropists
and
a
great
many
reporters
he
had
to
be
photographed
all
this
before
he
could
seek
those
whom
he
longed
to
see
they
printed
his
picture
as
he
was
before
he
went
to
prison
and
as
he
was
now
a
sort
of
comment
and
in
the
morning
that
it
all
appeared
when
the
spread
itself
to
tell
the
public
what
it
had
done
and
how
it
had
done
it
they
gave
him
his
address
it
would
be
better
they
thought
for
her
to
tell
him
herself
all
that
happened
no
one
of
them
was
brave
enough
to
stand
to
look
in
his
eyes
when
he
asked
for
his
son
and
daughter
and
they
shifted
their
responsibility
by
pretending
to
themselves
that
they
were
doing
it
for
his
own
good
that
the
blow
would
fall
more
gently
upon
him
coming
from
her
who
had
been
his
wife
berry
took
the
address
and
inquired
his
way
timidly
hesitatingly
but
with
a
swelling
heart
to
the
door
of
the
flat
where
fannie
lived
xviii
what
berry
found
had
not
berry
years
of
prison
life
made
him
forget
what
little
he
knew
of
reading
he
might
have
read
the
name
gibson
on
the
where
they
told
him
to
ring
for
his
wife
but
he
knew
nothing
of
what
awaited
him
as
he
confidently
pulled
the
bell
fannie
herself
came
to
the
door
the
news
the
papers
held
had
not
escaped
her
but
she
had
suffered
in
silence
hoping
that
berry
might
be
spared
the
pain
of
finding
her
now
he
stood
before
her
and
she
knew
him
at
a
glance
in
spite
of
his
haggard
countenance
fannie
he
said
holding
out
his
arms
to
her
and
all
of
the
pain
and
pathos
of
long
yearning
was
in
his
voice
do
you
know
me
she
shrank
away
from
him
back
in
the
yes
yes
i
knows
you
come
in
she
led
him
through
the
and
into
her
room
he
following
with
a
sudden
sinking
at
his
heart
this
was
not
the
reception
he
had
expected
from
fannie
when
they
were
within
the
room
he
turned
and
held
out
his
arms
to
her
again
but
she
did
not
notice
them
why
is
you
o
me
he
asked
brokenly
no
oh
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
began
rocking
to
and
fro
in
her
helpless
grief

forward
and
seized

his
voice
had
risen
to
a
fierce
roar
like
that
of
a

beast
and
he
shook
her
by
the
arm
as
he
spoke
oh
do
do
you
me
i
could
it
he
glared
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
the
real
force
of
the
situation
came
full
upon
him
and
he
bowed
his
head
in
his
hands
and
wept
like
a
child
the
great
sobs
came
up
and
stuck
in
his
throat
she
crept
up
to
him
fearfully
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
head
do
cry
she
said

he
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
tightly
until
he
could
control
himself
then
he
asked
weakly
well

to

joe
a
murderer
an
then
i
i
ust
to
pray

fathah
he
laughed
hoarsely
it
sounded
like
nothing
fannie
had
ever
heard
before
do
do
say
dat
maybe
we
do
her
faith
still
hung
by
a
slender
thread
but
his
had
given
way
in
that
moment
no
we
do
he
laughed
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
we
do
he
staggered
down
the
steps
blinded
by
his
emotions
and
set
his
face
towards
the
little
lodging
that
he
had
taken
temporarily
there
seemed
nothing
left
in
life
for
him
to
do
yet
he
knew
that
he
must
work
to
live
although
the
effort
seemed
hardly
worth
while
he
remembered
now
that
the
had
offered
him
the
under
janitorship
in
its
building
he
would
go
and
take
it
and
some
day
perhaps
he
was
not
quite
sure
what
the
perhaps
meant
but
as
his
mind
grew
clearer
he
came
to
know
for
a
sullen
fierce
anger
was
smouldering
in
his
heart
against
the
man
who
through
lies
had
stolen
his
wife
from
him
it
was
anger
that
came
slowly
but
gained
in
fierceness
as
it
grew
yes
that
was
it
he
would
kill
gibson
it
was
no
worse
than
his
present
state
then
it
would
be
father
and
son
murderers
they
would
hang
him
or
send
him
back
to
prison
neither
would
be
hard
now
he
laughed
to
himself
and
this
was
what
they
had
let
him
out
of
prison
for
to
find
out
all
this
why
had
they
not
left
him
there
to
die
in
ignorance
what
had
he
to
do
with
all
these
people
who
gave
him
sympathy
what
did
he
want
of
their
sympathy
could
they
give
him
back
one
tithe
of
what
he
had
lost
could
they
restore
to
him
his
wife
or
his
son
or
his
daughter
his
quiet
happiness
or
his
simple
faith
he
went
to
work
for
the
but
night
after
night
armed
he
patrolled
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
fannie
house
he
did
not
know
gibson
but
he
wanted
to
see
them
together
then
he
would
strike
his
vigils
kept
him
from
his
bed
but
he
went
to
the
next
morning
work
with
no
weariness
the
hope
of
revenge
sustained
him
and
he
took
a
savage
joy
in
the
thought
that
he
should
be
the
dispenser
of
justice
to
at
least
one
of
those
who
had
wounded
him
finally
he
grew
impatient
and
determined
to
wait
no
longer
but
to
seek
his
enemy
in
his
own
house
he
approached
the
place
cautiously
and
went
up
the
steps
his
hand
touched
the
he
staggered
back
oh
my
gawd
he
said
there
was
crape
on
fannie
bell
his
head
went
round
and
he
held
to
the
door
for
support
then
he
turned
the
knob
and
the
door
opened
he
went
noiselessly
in
at
the
door
of
fannie
room
he
halted
sick
with
fear
he
knocked
a
step
sounded
within
and
his
wife
face
looked
out
upon
him
he
could
have
screamed
aloud
with
relief
it
ai
you
he
whispered
huskily
no
it
him
he
was
killed
in
a
fight
at
the
some
o
his
frinds
are
settin
up
come
in
he
went
in
a
wild
strange
feeling
surging
at
his
heart
she
showed
him
into
the
as
he
stood
and
looked
down
upon
the
face
of
his
enemy
still
cold
and
terrible
in
death
the
recognition
of
how
near
he
had
come
to
crime
swept
over
him
and
all
his
dead
faith
sprang
into
new
life
in
a
glorious
resurrection
he
stood
with
clasped
hands
and
no
word
passed
his
lips
but
his
heart
was
crying
thank
god
thank
god
this
blood
is
not
on
my
hands
the
gamblers
who
were
sitting
up
with
the
dead
wondered
who
the
old
fool
was
who
looked
at
their
silent
comrade
and
then
raised
his
eyes
as
if
in
prayer
when
gibson
was
laid
away
there
were
no
formalities
between
berry
and
his
wife
they
simply
went
back
to
each
other
new
york
held
nothing
for
them
now
but
sad
memories
kit
was
on
the
road
and
the
father
could
not
bear
to
see
his
son
so
they
turned
their
faces
southward
back
to
the
only
place
they
could
call
home
surely
the
people
could
not
be
cruel
to
them
now
and
even
if
they
were
they
felt
that
after
what
they
had
endured
no
wound
had
power
to
give
them
pain
leslie
oakley
heard
of
their
coming
and
with
her
own
hands
and
refurnished
the
little
cottage
in
the
yard
for
them
there
the
woman
begged
them
to
spend
the
rest
of
their
days
and
be
in
peace
and
comfort
it
was
the
only
amend
she
could
make
as
much
to
satisfy
her
as
to
settle
themselves
they
took
the
cottage
and
many
a
night
thereafter
they
sat
together
with
clasped
hands
listening
to
the
shrieks
of
the
madman
across
the
yard
and
thinking
of
what
he
had
brought
to
them
and
to
himself
it
was
not
a
happy
life
but
it
was
all
that
was
left
to
them
and
they
took
it
up
without
complaint
for
they
knew
they
were
powerless
against
some
will
infinitely
stronger
than
their
own
