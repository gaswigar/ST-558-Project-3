the
sad
shepherd
i
darkness
out
of
the
valley
of
gardens
where
a
film
of
snow
lay
smooth
as
feathers
on
the
breast
of
a
dove
the
ancient
pools
of
solomon
looked
up
into
the
night
sky
with
dark
tranquil
eyes
and
passive
reflecting
the
crisp
stars
and
the
small
round
moon
the
full
springs
overflowing
on
the
melted
their
way
through
the
field
of
white
in
winding
channels
and
along
their
course
the
grass
was
green
even
in
the
dead
of
winter
but
the
sad
shepherd
walked
far
above
the
friendly
valley
in
a
region
where
ridges
of
gray
rock
welted
and
scarred
the
back
of
the
earth
like
wounds
of
strife
and
battles
long
ago
the
solitude
was
forbidding
and
disquieting
the
keen
air
that
searched
the
wanderer
had
no
pity
in
it
and
the
myriad
glances
of
the
night
were
curiously
cold
his
flock
straggled
after
him
the
sheep
and
dejected
followed
the
path
with
low
heads
nodding
from
side
to
side
as
if
they
had
traveled
far
and
found
little
pasture
the
black
goats
leaped
upon
the
rocks
restless
and
ravenous
tearing
down
the
tender
branches
and
leaves
of
the
dwarf
oaks
and
wild
olives
they
reared
up
against
the
twisted
trunks
and
crawled
and
scrambled
among
the
boughs
it
was
like
a
company
of
gray
downcast
friends
and
a
troop
of
merry
little
black
devils
following
the
sad
shepherd
afar
off
he
walked
looking
on
the
ground
paying
small
heed
to
them
now
and
again
when
the
sound
of
pattering
feet
and
panting
breath
and
the
rustling
and
rending
among
the
copses
fell
too
far
behind
he
drew
out
his
shepherd
pipe
and
blew
a
strain
of
music
shrill
and
plaintive
quavering
and
lamenting
through
the
hollow
night
he
waited
while
the
troops
of
gray
and
black
scuffled
and
bounded
and
trotted
near
to
him
then
he
dropped
the
pipe
into
its
place
again
and
strode
forward
looking
on
the
ground
the
fitful
shivery
wind
that
rasped
the
fluttered
the
rags
of
his
long
mantle
of
tyrian
blue
torn
by
thorns
and
stained
by
travel
the
rich
tunic
of
striped
silk
beneath
it
was
worn
thin
and
the
girdle
about
his
loins
had
lost
all
its
ornaments
of
silver
and
jewels
his
curling
hair
hung
down
dishevelled
under
a
turban
of
fine
linen
in
which
the
gilt
threads
were
frayed
and
tarnished
and
his
shoes
of
soft
leather
were
broken
by
the
road
on
his
brown
fingers
the
places
of
the
vanished
rings
were
still
marked
in
white
skin
he
carried
not
the
long
staff
nor
the
heavy
rod
of
the
shepherd
but
a
slender
stick
of
carved
cedar
battered
and
scratched
by
hard
usage
and
the
handle
which
must
once
have
been
of
precious
metal
was
missing
he
was
a
strange
figure
for
that
lonely
place
and
that
humble
branch
of
faded
beauty
from
some
royal
garden
tossed
by
rude
winds
into
the
pleasure
craft
adrift
buffeted
and
broken
on
rough
seas
but
he
seemed
to
have
passed
beyond
caring
his
young
face
was
frayed
and
threadbare
as
his
garments
the
splendor
of
the
moonlight
flooding
the
wild
world
meant
as
little
to
him
as
the
hardness
of
the
rugged
track
which
he
followed
he
wrapped
his
tattered
mantle
closer
around
him
and
strode
ahead
looking
on
the
ground
as
the
path
dropped
from
the
summit
of
the
ridge
toward
the
valley
of
mills
and
passed
among
huge
broken
rocks
three
men
sprang
at
him
from
the
shadows
he
lifted
his
stick
but
let
it
fall
again
and
a
strange
ghost
of
a
smile
twisted
his
face
as
they
gripped
him
and
threw
him
down
you
are
rough
beggars
he
said
say
what
you
want
you
are
welcome
to
it
your
money
dog
of
a
courtier
they
muttered
fiercely
give
us
your
golden
collar
herod
hound
quick
or
you
die
the
quicker
the
better
he
answered
closing
his
eyes
the
bewildered
flock
of
sheep
and
goats
gathered
in
a
silent
ring
stood
at
gaze
while
the
robbers
fumbled
over
their
master
this
is
a
stray
dog
said
one
he
has
lost
his
collar
there
is
not
even
the
price
of
a
mouthful
of
wine
on
him
shall
we
kill
him
and
leave
him
for
the
vultures
what
have
the
vultures
done
for
us
said
another
that
we
should
feed
them
let
us
take
his
cloak
and
drive
off
his
flock
and
leave
him
to
die
in
his
own
time
with
a
kick
and
a
curse
they
left
him
he
opened
his
eyes
and
lay
quiet
for
a
moment
with
his
twisted
smile
watching
the
stars
you
creep
like
snails
he
said
i
thought
you
had
marked
my
time
tonight
but
not
even
that
is
given
to
me
for
nothing
i
must
pay
for
all
it
seems
far
away
slowly
scattering
and
receding
he
heard
the
rustling
and
bleating
of
his
frightened
flock
as
the
robbers
running
and
shouting
tried
to
drive
them
over
the
hills
then
he
stood
up
and
took
the
shepherd
pipe
a
worthless
bit
of
reed
from
the
breast
of
his
tunic
he
blew
again
that
plaintive
piercing
air
sounding
it
out
over
the
ridges
and
distant
thickets
it
seemed
to
have
neither
beginning
nor
end
a
melancholy
pleading
tune
that
searched
forever
after
something
lost
while
he
played
the
sheep
and
the
goats
slipping
away
from
their
captors
by
roundabout
ways
hiding
behind
the
laurel
bushes
following
the
dark
gullies
leaping
down
the
broken
cliffs
came
circling
back
to
him
one
after
another
and
as
they
came
he
interrupted
his
playing
now
and
then
to
call
them
by
name
when
they
were
nearly
all
assembled
he
went
down
swiftly
toward
the
lower
valley
and
they
followed
him
panting
at
the
last
crook
of
the
path
on
the
steep
hillside
a
straggler
came
after
him
along
the
cliff
he
looked
up
and
saw
it
outlined
against
the
sky
then
he
saw
it
leap
and
slip
and
fall
beyond
the
path
into
a
deep
cleft
little
fool
he
said
fortune
is
kind
to
you
you
have
escaped
from
the
big
trap
of
life
what
you
are
crying
for
help
you
are
still
in
the
trap
then
i
must
go
down
to
you
little
fool
for
i
am
a
fool
too
but
why
i
must
do
it
i
know
no
more
than
you
know
he
lowered
himself
quickly
and
perilously
into
the
cleft
and
found
the
creature
with
its
leg
broken
and
bleeding
it
was
not
a
sheep
but
a
young
goat
he
had
no
cloak
to
wrap
it
in
but
he
took
off
his
turban
and
unrolled
it
and
bound
it
around
the
trembling
animal
then
he
climbed
back
to
the
path
and
strode
on
at
the
head
of
his
flock
carrying
the
little
black
kid
in
his
arms
there
were
houses
in
the
valley
of
the
mills
and
in
some
of
them
lights
were
burning
and
the
drone
of
the
where
the
women
were
still
grinding
came
out
into
the
night
like
the
humming
of
drowsy
bees
as
the
women
heard
the
pattering
and
bleating
of
the
flock
they
wondered
who
was
passing
so
late
one
of
them
in
a
house
where
there
was
no
mill
but
many
lights
came
to
the
door
and
looked
out
laughing
her
face
and
bosom
bare
but
the
sad
shepherd
did
not
stay
his
long
shadow
and
the
confused
mass
of
lesser
shadows
behind
him
drifted
down
the
white
moonlight
past
the
yellow
bars
of
lamplight
that
gleamed
from
the
doorways
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
bound
to
go
somewhere
and
would
not
delay
yet
with
all
his
haste
to
be
gone
it
was
plain
that
he
thought
little
of
where
he
was
going
for
when
he
came
to
the
foot
of
the
valley
where
the
paths
divided
he
stood
between
them
staring
vacantly
without
a
desire
to
turn
him
this
way
or
that
the
imperative
of
choice
halted
him
like
a
barrier
the
balance
of
his
mind
hung
even
because
both
scales
were
empty
he
could
act
he
could
go
for
his
strength
was
untouched
but
he
could
not
choose
for
his
will
was
broken
within
him
the
path
to
the
left
went
up
toward
the
little
town
of
bethlehem
with
huddled
roofs
and
walls
in
silhouette
along
the
hill
it
was
dark
and
forbidding
as
a
closed
fortress
the
sad
shepherd
looked
at
it
with
indifferent
eyes
there
was
nothing
there
to
draw
him
the
path
to
the
right
wound
through
valleys
toward
the
dead
sea
but
rising
out
of
that
crumpled
wilderness
a
mile
or
two
away
the
smooth
white
ribbon
of
a
lay
upon
the
flank
of
a
mountain
and
curled
in
loops
toward
its
peak
there
the
great
cone
was
cut
squarely
off
and
the
levelled
summit
was
capped
by
a
palace
of
marble
with
round
towers
at
the
corners
and
flaring
beacons
along
the
walls
and
the
glow
of
an
immense
fire
hidden
in
the
central
painted
a
false
dawn
in
the
eastern
sky
all
down
the
mountain
slopes
on
terraces
and
blind
arcades
the
lights
flashed
from
lesser
pavilions
and
it
was
the
secret
orchard
of
herod
and
his
friends
their
with
the
spirits
of
mirth
and
madness
they
called
it
the
mountain
of
the
little
paradise
rich
gardens
were
there
and
the
cool
water
from
the
pools
of
solomon
plashed
in
the
fountains
and
trees
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
fruited
and
above
them
and
smooth
curving
glistening
shapes
whispering
softly
of
pleasure
lay
among
the
flowers
and
glided
behind
the
trees
all
this
was
now
hidden
in
the
dark
only
the
strange
bulk
of
the
mountain
a
sharp
black
pyramid
girdled
and
crowned
with
fire
loomed
across
the
mountain
once
seen
never
to
be
forgotten
the
sad
shepherd
remembered
it
well
he
looked
at
it
with
the
eyes
of
a
child
who
has
been
in
hell
it
burned
him
from
afar
turning
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
he
walked
without
a
path
straight
out
upon
the
plain
of
bethlehem
still
whitened
in
the
hollows
and
on
the
sheltered
side
of
its
rounded
hillocks
by
the
veil
of
snow
he
faced
a
wide
and
empty
world
to
the
west
in
sleeping
bethlehem
to
the
east
in
flaring
herodium
the
life
of
man
was
infinitely
far
away
from
him
even
the
stars
seemed
to
withdraw
themselves
against
the
of
the
sky
they
diminished
and
receded
till
they
were
like
in
the
vault
above
him
the
moon
in
shrank
into
a
bit
of
burnished
silver
hard
and
glittering
immeasurably
remote
the
ragged
inhospitable
ridges
of
tekoa
lay
stretched
in
mortal
slumber
along
the
horizon
and
between
them
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
sunken
lake
of
death
darkly
gleaming
in
its
deep
bed
there
was
no
movement
no
sound
on
the
plain
where
he
walked
except
the
feet
of
his
dumb
obsequious
flock
he
felt
an
endless
isolation
strike
cold
to
his
heart
against
which
he
held
the
limp
body
of
the
wounded
kid
wondering
the
while
with
a
for
his
own
foolishness
why
he
took
such
trouble
to
save
a
tiny
scrap
of
the
worthless
tissue
which
is
called
life
even
when
a
man
does
not
know
or
care
where
he
is
going
if
he
steps
onward
he
will
get
there
in
an
hour
or
more
of
walking
over
the
plain
the
sad
shepherd
came
to
a
of
gray
stones
with
a
rude
tower
beside
it
the
fold
was
full
of
sheep
and
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
a
little
fire
of
thorns
was
burning
around
which
four
shepherds
were
crouching
wrapped
in
their
thick
woollen
cloaks
as
the
stranger
approached
they
looked
up
and
one
of
them
rose
quickly
to
his
feet
grasping
his
knotted
club
but
when
they
saw
the
flock
that
followed
the
sad
shepherd
they
stared
at
each
other
and
said
it
is
one
of
us
a
keeper
of
sheep
but
how
comes
he
here
in
this
raiment
it
is
what
men
wear
in
kings
houses
no
said
the
one
who
was
standing
it
is
what
they
wear
when
they
have
been
thrown
out
of
them
look
at
the
rags
he
may
be
a
thief
and
a
robber
with
his
stolen
flock
salute
him
when
he
comes
near
said
the
oldest
shepherd
are
we
not
four
to
one
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
a
ragged
traveller
speak
him
fair
it
is
the
will
of
it
costs
nothing
peace
be
with
you
brother
cried
the
youngest
shepherd
may
your
mother
and
father
be
blessed
may
your
heart
be
enlarged
the
stranger
answered
and
may
all
your
families
be
more
blessed
than
mine
for
i
have
none
a
homeless
man
said
the
old
shepherd
has
either
been
robbed
by
his
fellows
or
punished
by
god
i
do
not
know
which
it
was
answered
the
stranger
the
end
is
the
same
as
you
see
by
your
speech
you
come
from
galilee
where
are
you
going
what
are
you
seeking
here
i
was
going
nowhere
my
masters
but
it
was
cold
on
the
way
there
and
my
feet
turned
to
your
fire
come
then
if
you
are
a
peaceable
man
and
warm
your
feet
with
us
heat
is
a
good
gift
divide
it
and
it
is
not
less
but
you
shall
have
bread
and
salt
too
if
you
will
may
your
hospitality
enrich
you
i
am
your
unworthy
guest
but
my
flock
let
your
flock
shelter
by
the
south
wall
of
the
fold
there
is
good
picking
there
and
no
wind
come
you
and
sit
with
us
so
they
all
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
the
sad
shepherd
ate
of
their
bread
but
sparingly
like
a
man
to
whom
hunger
brings
a
need
but
no
joy
in
the
satisfying
of
it
and
the
others
were
silent
for
a
proper
time
out
of
courtesy
then
the
oldest
shepherd
spoke
my
name
is
zadok
the
son
of
eliezer
of
bethlehem
i
am
the
chief
shepherd
of
the
flocks
of
the
temple
which
are
before
you
in
the
fold
these
are
my
sister
sons
jotham
and
shama
and
nathan
their
father
elkanah
is
dead
and
but
for
these
i
am
a
childless
man
my
name
replied
the
stranger
is
ammiel
the
son
of
jochanan
of
the
city
of
bethsaida
by
the
sea
of
galilee
and
i
am
a
fatherless
man
it
is
better
to
be
childless
than
fatherless
said
zadok
yet
it
is
the
will
of
god
that
children
should
bury
their
fathers
when
did
the
blessed
jochanan
die
i
know
not
whether
he
be
dead
or
alive
it
is
three
years
since
i
looked
upon
his
face
or
had
word
of
him
you
are
an
exile
then
he
has
cast
you
off
it
was
the
other
way
said
ammiel
looking
on
the
ground
at
this
the
shepherd
shama
who
had
listened
with
doubt
in
his
face
started
up
in
anger
pig
of
a
galilean
he
cried
despiser
of
parents
breaker
of
the
law
when
i
saw
you
coming
i
knew
you
for
something
vile
why
do
you
darken
the
night
for
us
with
your
presence
you
have
reviled
him
who
begot
you
away
or
we
stone
you
ammiel
did
not
answer
or
move
the
twisted
smile
passed
over
his
bowed
face
again
as
he
waited
to
know
the
shepherds
will
with
him
even
as
he
had
waited
for
the
robbers
but
zadok
lifted
his
hand
not
so
hasty
you
also
break
the
law
by
judging
a
man
unheard
the
rabbis
have
told
us
that
there
is
a
tradition
of
the
rule
as
holy
as
the
law
a
man
may
deny
his
father
in
a
certain
way
without
sin
it
is
a
strange
rule
and
it
must
be
very
holy
or
it
would
not
be
so
strange
but
this
is
the
teaching
of
the
elders
a
son
may
say
of
anything
for
which
his
father
asks
sheep
or
a
measure
of
corn
or
a
field
or
a
purse
of
is
corban
a
gift
that
i
have
vowed
unto
the
lord
and
so
his
father
shall
have
no
more
claim
upon
him
have
you
said
to
your
father
have
you
made
a
vow
unto
the
lord
i
have
said
answered
ammiel
lifting
his
face
still
shadowed
by
that
strange
smile
but
it
was
not
the
lord
who
heard
my
vow
tell
us
what
you
have
done
said
the
old
man
sternly
for
we
will
neither
judge
you
nor
shelter
you
unless
we
hear
your
story
there
is
nothing
in
it
replied
ammiel
indifferently
it
is
an
old
story
but
if
you
are
curious
you
shall
hear
it
afterward
you
shall
deal
with
me
as
you
will
so
the
shepherds
wrapped
in
their
warm
cloaks
sat
listening
with
grave
faces
and
watchful
unsearchable
eyes
while
ammiel
in
his
tattered
silk
sat
by
the
sinking
fire
of
thorns
and
told
his
tale
with
a
voice
that
had
no
room
for
hope
or
cool
dead
voice
that
spoke
only
of
things
ended
ii
nightfire
in
my
father
house
i
was
the
second
son
my
brother
was
honored
and
trusted
in
all
things
he
was
a
prudent
man
and
profitable
to
the
household
all
that
he
counselled
was
done
all
that
he
wished
he
had
my
place
was
a
narrow
one
there
was
neither
honor
nor
joy
in
it
for
it
was
filled
with
daily
tasks
and
rebukes
no
one
cared
for
me
my
mother
sometimes
wept
when
i
was
rebuked
perhaps
she
was
disappointed
in
me
but
she
had
no
power
to
make
things
better
i
felt
that
i
was
a
beast
of
burden
fed
only
in
order
that
i
might
be
useful
and
the
dull
life
irked
me
like
an
harness
there
was
nothing
in
it
i
went
to
my
father
and
claimed
my
share
of
the
inheritance
he
was
rich
he
gave
it
to
me
it
did
not
impoverish
him
and
it
made
me
free
i
said
to
him
and
shook
the
dust
of
bethsaida
from
my
feet
i
went
out
to
look
for
mirth
and
love
and
joy
and
all
that
is
pleasant
to
the
eyes
and
sweet
to
the
taste
if
a
god
made
me
thought
i
he
made
me
to
live
and
the
pride
of
life
was
strong
in
my
heart
and
in
my
flesh
my
vow
was
offered
to
that
god
i
served
him
in
jerusalem
in
alexandria
in
rome
for
his
altars
are
everywhere
and
men
worship
him
openly
or
in
secret
my
money
and
youth
made
me
welcome
to
his
followers
and
i
spent
them
both
freely
as
if
they
could
never
come
to
an
end
i
clothed
myself
in
purple
and
fine
linen
and
fared
sumptuously
every
day
the
wine
of
cyprus
and
the
dishes
of
egypt
and
syria
were
on
my
table
my
dwelling
was
crowded
with
merry
guests
they
came
for
what
i
gave
them
their
faces
were
hungry
and
their
soft
touch
was
like
the
clinging
of
leeches
to
them
i
was
nothing
but
money
and
youth
no
longer
a
beast
of
beast
of
pleasure
there
was
nothing
in
it
from
the
richest
fare
my
heart
went
away
empty
and
after
the
wildest
banquet
my
soul
fell
drunk
and
solitary
into
sleep
then
i
thought
power
is
better
than
pleasure
if
a
man
will
feast
and
revel
let
him
do
it
with
the
great
they
will
favor
him
and
raise
him
up
for
the
service
that
he
renders
them
he
will
obtain
place
and
authority
in
the
world
and
gain
many
friends
so
i
joined
myself
to
herod
when
the
sad
shepherd
spoke
this
name
his
listeners
drew
back
front
him
as
if
it
were
a
defilement
to
hear
it
they
spat
upon
the
ground
and
cursed
the
idumean
who
called
himself
their
king
a
slave
jotham
cried
a
bloody
tyrant
and
a
slave
from
edom
a
fox
a
vile
beast
who
devours
his
own
children
god
burn
him
in
gehenna
the
old
zadok
picked
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
into
the
darkness
saying
slowly
i
cast
this
stone
on
the
grave
of
the
idumean
the
blasphemer
the
defiler
of
the
temple
god
send
us
soon
the
deliverer
the
promised
one
the
true
king
of
israel
ammiel
made
no
sign
but
went
on
with
his
story
herod
used
me
well
his
own
purpose
he
welcomed
me
to
his
palace
and
his
table
and
gave
me
a
place
among
his
favorites
he
was
so
much
my
friend
that
he
borrowed
my
money
there
were
many
of
the
nobles
of
jerusalem
with
him
sadducees
and
proselytes
from
rome
and
asia
and
women
from
everywhere
the
law
of
israel
was
observed
in
the
open
court
when
the
people
were
watching
but
in
the
secret
feasts
there
was
no
law
but
the
will
of
herod
and
many
deities
were
served
but
no
god
was
worshipped
there
the
captains
and
the
princes
of
rome
consorted
with
the
and
his
sons
by
night
and
there
was
much
coming
and
going
by
hidden
ways
everybody
was
a
borrower
or
a
lender
a
buyer
or
a
seller
of
favors
it
was
a
house
of
diligent
madness
there
was
nothing
in
it
in
the
midst
of
this
whirling
life
a
great
need
of
love
came
upon
me
and
i
wished
to
hold
some
one
in
my
inmost
heart
at
a
certain
place
in
the
city
within
closed
doors
i
saw
a
young
dancing
she
was
about
fifteen
years
old
thin
and
supple
she
danced
like
a
reed
in
the
wind
but
her
eyes
were
weary
as
death
and
her
white
body
was
marked
with
bruises
she
stumbled
and
the
men
laughed
at
her
she
fell
and
her
mistress
beat
her
crying
out
that
she
would
fain
be
rid
of
such
a
slave
i
paid
the
price
and
took
her
to
my
dwelling
her
name
was
tamar
she
was
a
daughter
of
lebanon
i
robed
her
in
silk
and
broidered
linen
i
nourished
her
with
tender
care
so
that
beauty
came
upon
her
like
the
blossoming
of
an
almond
tree
she
was
a
garden
enclosed
breathing
spices
her
eyes
were
like
doves
behind
her
veil
her
lips
were
a
thread
of
scarlet
her
neck
was
a
tower
of
ivory
and
her
breasts
were
as
two
fawns
which
feed
among
the
lilies
she
was
whiter
than
milk
and
more
rosy
than
the
flower
of
the
peach
and
her
dancing
was
like
the
flight
of
a
bird
among
the
branches
so
i
loved
her
she
lay
in
my
bosom
as
a
clear
stone
that
one
has
bought
and
polished
and
set
in
fine
gold
at
the
end
of
a
golden
chain
never
was
she
glad
at
my
coming
or
sorry
at
my
going
never
did
she
give
me
anything
except
what
i
took
from
her
there
was
nothing
in
it
now
whether
herod
knew
of
the
jewel
that
i
kept
in
my
dwelling
i
can
not
tell
it
was
sure
that
he
had
his
spies
in
all
the
city
and
himself
walked
the
streets
by
night
in
a
disguise
on
a
certain
day
he
sent
for
me
and
had
me
into
his
secret
chamber
professing
great
love
toward
me
and
more
confidence
than
in
any
man
that
lived
so
i
must
go
to
rome
for
him
bearing
a
sealed
letter
and
a
private
message
to
caesar
all
my
goods
would
be
left
safely
in
the
hands
of
the
king
my
friend
who
would
reward
me
double
there
was
a
certain
place
of
high
authority
at
jerusalem
which
caesar
would
gladly
bestow
on
a
jew
who
had
done
him
a
service
this
mission
would
commend
me
to
him
it
was
a
great
occasion
suited
to
my
powers
thus
herod
fed
me
with
fair
promises
and
i
ran
his
errand
there
was
nothing
in
it
i
stood
before
caesar
and
gave
him
the
letter
he
read
it
and
laughed
saying
that
a
prince
with
an
incurable
hunger
is
a
servant
of
value
to
an
emperor
then
he
asked
me
if
there
was
nothing
sent
with
the
letter
i
answered
that
there
was
no
gift
but
a
message
for
his
private
ear
he
drew
me
aside
and
i
told
him
that
herod
begged
earnestly
that
his
dear
son
antipater
might
be
sent
back
in
haste
from
rome
to
palestine
for
the
king
had
great
need
of
him
at
this
caesar
laughed
again
bury
him
i
suppose
said
he
his
brothers
alexander
and
aristobulus
truly
it
is
better
to
be
herod
swine
than
his
son
tell
the
old
fox
he
may
catch
his
own
prey
with
this
he
turned
from
me
and
i
withdrew
unrewarded
to
make
my
way
back
as
best
i
could
with
an
empty
purse
to
palestine
i
had
seen
the
lord
of
the
world
there
was
nothing
in
it
selling
my
rings
and
bracelets
i
got
passage
in
a
trading
ship
for
joppa
there
i
heard
that
the
king
was
not
in
jerusalem
at
his
palace
of
the
upper
city
but
had
gone
with
his
friends
to
make
merry
for
a
month
on
the
mountain
of
the
little
paradise
on
that
over
against
us
where
the
lights
are
flaring
in
the
where
couches
are
spread
for
a
hundred
guests
i
found
herod
the
listening
shepherds
spat
upon
the
ground
again
and
jotham
muttered
may
the
worms
that
devour
his
flesh
never
die
but
zadok
whispered
we
wait
for
the
lord
salvation
to
come
out
of
zion
and
the
sad
shepherd
looking
with
fixed
eyes
at
the
firelit
mountain
far
away
continued
his
story
the
king
lay
on
his
ivory
couch
and
the
sweat
of
his
disease
was
heavy
upon
him
for
he
was
old
and
his
flesh
was
corrupted
but
his
hair
and
his
beard
were
dyed
and
perfumed
and
there
was
a
wreath
of
roses
on
his
head
the
hall
was
full
of
nobles
and
great
men
the
sons
of
the
were
there
and
the
servants
poured
their
wine
in
cups
of
gold
there
was
a
sound
of
soft
music
and
all
the
men
were
watching
a
girl
who
danced
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
the
eyes
of
herod
were
fiery
like
the
eyes
of
a
fox
the
dancer
was
tamar
she
glistened
like
the
snow
on
lebanon
and
the
redness
of
her
was
ruddier
than
a
pomegranate
and
her
dancing
was
like
the
coiling
of
white
serpents
when
the
dance
was
ended
her
attendants
threw
a
veil
of
gauze
over
her
and
she
lay
among
her
cushions
half
covered
with
flowers
at
the
feet
of
the
king
through
the
sound
of
clapping
hands
and
shouting
two
slaves
led
me
behind
the
couch
of
herod
his
eyes
narrowed
as
they
fell
upon
me
i
told
him
the
message
of
caesar
making
it
soft
as
if
it
were
a
word
that
suffered
him
to
catch
his
prey
he
stroked
his
beard
softly
and
his
look
fell
on
tamar
have
caught
it
he
murmured
all
the
gods
i
have
always
caught
it
and
my
dear
son
antipater
is
coming
home
of
his
own
will
i
have
lured
him
he
is
mine
then
a
look
of
madness
crossed
his
face
and
he
sprang
up
with
frothing
lips
and
struck
at
me
is
this
he
cried
spy
a
servant
of
my
false
son
a
traitor
in
my
who
are
you
i
knelt
before
him
protesting
that
he
must
know
me
that
i
was
his
friend
his
messenger
that
i
had
left
all
my
goods
in
his
hands
that
the
girl
who
had
danced
for
him
was
mine
at
this
his
face
changed
again
and
he
fell
back
on
his
couch
shaken
with
horrible
laughter
he
cried
was
she
yours
what
is
yours
i
know
you
now
poor
madman
you
are
ammiel
a
crazy
shepherd
from
galilee
who
troubled
us
some
time
since
take
him
away
slaves
he
has
twenty
sheep
and
twenty
goats
among
my
flocks
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
see
to
it
that
he
gets
them
and
drive
him
away
i
fought
against
the
slaves
with
my
bare
hands
but
they
held
me
i
called
to
tamar
begging
her
to
have
pity
on
me
to
speak
for
me
to
come
with
me
she
looked
up
with
her
eyes
like
doves
behind
her
veil
but
there
was
no
knowledge
of
me
in
them
she
laughed
lazily
as
if
it
were
a
poor
comedy
and
flung
a
broken
in
my
face
then
the
silver
cord
was
loosened
within
me
and
my
heart
went
out
and
i
struggled
no
more
there
was
nothing
in
it
afterward
i
found
myself
on
the
road
with
this
flock
i
led
them
past
hebron
into
the
south
country
and
so
by
the
vale
of
eshcol
and
over
many
hills
beyond
the
pools
of
solomon
until
my
feet
brought
me
to
your
fire
here
i
rest
on
the
way
to
nowhere
he
sat
silent
and
the
four
shepherds
looked
at
him
with
amazement
it
is
a
bitter
tale
said
shama
and
you
are
a
great
sinner
i
should
be
a
fool
not
to
know
that
answered
the
sad
shepherd
but
the
knowledge
does
me
no
good
you
must
repent
said
nathan
the
youngest
shepherd
in
a
friendly
voice
how
can
a
man
repent
answered
the
sad
shepherd
unless
he
has
hope
but
i
am
sorry
for
everything
and
most
of
all
for
living
would
you
not
live
to
kill
the
fox
herod
cried
jotham
fiercely
why
should
i
let
him
out
of
the
trap
answered
the
sad
shepherd
is
he
not
dying
more
slowly
than
i
could
kill
him
you
must
have
faith
in
god
said
zadok
earnestly
and
gravely
he
is
too
far
away
then
you
must
have
love
for
your
neighbor
he
is
too
near
my
confidence
in
man
was
like
a
pool
by
the
wayside
it
was
shallow
but
there
was
water
in
it
and
sometimes
a
star
shone
there
now
the
feet
of
many
beasts
have
trampled
through
it
and
the
jackals
have
drunken
of
it
and
there
is
no
more
water
it
is
dry
and
the
mire
is
caked
at
the
bottom
is
there
nothing
good
in
the
world
there
is
pleasure
but
i
am
sick
of
it
there
is
power
but
i
hate
it
there
is
wisdom
but
i
mistrust
it
life
is
a
game
and
every
player
is
for
his
own
hand
mine
is
played
i
have
nothing
to
win
or
lose
you
are
young
you
have
many
years
to
live
i
am
old
yet
the
days
before
me
are
too
many
but
you
travel
the
road
you
go
forward
do
you
hope
for
nothing
i
hope
for
nothing
said
the
sad
shepherd
yet
if
one
thing
should
come
to
me
it
might
be
the
beginning
of
hope
if
i
saw
in
man
or
woman
a
deed
of
kindness
without
a
selfish
reason
and
a
proof
of
love
gladly
given
for
its
own
sake
only
then
might
i
turn
my
face
toward
that
light
till
that
comes
how
can
i
have
faith
in
god
whom
i
have
never
seen
i
have
seen
the
world
which
he
has
made
and
it
brings
me
no
faith
there
is
nothing
in
it
said
the
old
man
sternly
you
are
a
son
of
israel
and
we
have
had
compassion
on
you
according
to
the
law
but
you
are
an
apostate
an
unbeliever
and
we
can
have
no
more
fellowship
with
you
lest
a
curse
come
upon
us
the
company
of
the
desperate
brings
misfortune
go
your
way
and
depart
from
us
for
our
way
is
not
yours
so
the
sad
shepherd
thanked
them
for
their
entertainment
and
took
the
little
kid
again
in
his
arms
and
went
into
the
night
calling
his
flock
but
the
youngest
shepherd
nathan
followed
him
a
few
steps
and
said
there
is
a
broken
fold
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
it
is
old
and
small
but
you
may
find
a
shelter
there
for
your
flock
where
the
wind
will
not
shake
you
go
your
way
with
god
brother
and
see
better
days
then
ammiel
went
a
little
way
down
the
hill
and
sheltered
his
flock
in
a
corner
of
the
crumbling
walls
he
lay
among
the
sheep
and
the
goats
with
his
face
upon
his
folded
arms
and
whether
the
time
passed
slowly
or
swiftly
he
did
not
know
for
he
slept
he
waked
as
nathan
came
running
and
stumbling
among
the
scattered
stones
we
have
seen
a
vision
he
cried
a
wonderful
vision
of
angels
did
you
not
hear
them
they
sang
loudly
of
the
hope
of
israel
we
are
going
to
bethlehem
to
see
this
thing
which
is
come
to
pass
come
you
and
keep
watch
over
our
sheep
while
we
are
gone
of
angels
i
have
seen
and
heard
nothing
said
ammiel
but
i
will
guard
your
flocks
with
mine
since
i
am
in
debt
to
you
for
bread
and
fire
so
he
brought
the
kid
in
his
arms
and
the
weary
flock
straggling
after
him
to
the
south
wall
of
the
great
fold
again
and
sat
there
by
the
embers
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
while
the
others
were
away
the
moon
rested
like
a
ball
on
the
edge
of
the
western
hills
and
rolled
behind
them
the
stars
faded
in
the
east
and
the
fires
went
out
on
the
mountain
of
the
little
paradise
over
the
hills
of
moab
a
gray
flood
of
dawn
rose
slowly
and
arrows
of
red
shot
far
up
before
the
sunrise
the
shepherds
returned
full
of
joy
and
told
what
they
had
seen
it
was
even
as
the
angels
said
unto
us
said
shama
and
it
must
be
true
the
king
of
israel
has
come
the
faithful
shall
be
blessed
herod
shall
fall
cried
jotham
lifting
his
clenched
fist
toward
the
dark
peaked
mountain
burn
black
idumean
in
the
bottomless
pit
where
the
fire
is
not
quenched
zadok
spoke
more
quietly
we
found
the
child
of
whom
the
angels
told
us
wrapped
in
swaddling
clothes
and
lying
in
a
manger
the
ways
of
god
are
wonderful
his
salvation
comes
out
of
darkness
and
we
trust
in
the
promised
deliverance
but
you
except
you
believe
you
shall
not
see
it
yet
since
you
have
kept
our
flocks
faithfully
and
because
of
the
joy
that
has
come
to
us
i
give
you
this
piece
of
silver
to
help
you
on
your
way
but
nathan
came
close
to
the
sad
shepherd
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
with
a
friendly
hand
go
you
also
to
bethlehem
he
said
in
a
low
voice
for
it
is
good
to
see
what
we
have
seen
and
we
will
keep
your
flock
until
you
return
i
will
go
said
ammiel
looking
into
his
face
for
i
think
you
wish
me
well
but
whether
i
shall
see
what
you
have
seen
or
whether
i
shall
ever
return
i
know
not
farewell
iii
dawn
the
narrow
streets
of
bethlehem
were
waking
to
the
first
stir
of
life
as
the
sad
shepherd
came
into
the
town
with
the
morning
and
passed
through
them
like
one
walking
in
his
sleep
the
of
the
great
khan
and
the
open
rooms
around
it
were
crowded
with
travelers
rousing
them
from
their
night
rest
and
making
ready
for
the
day
journey
in
front
of
the
stables
half
hollowed
in
the
rock
beside
the
inn
men
were
saddling
their
horses
and
their
beasts
of
burden
and
there
was
much
noise
and
confusion
but
beyond
these
at
the
end
of
the
line
there
was
a
deeper
grotto
in
the
rock
which
was
used
only
when
the
nearer
stalls
were
full
at
the
entrance
of
this
an
ass
was
tethered
and
a
man
of
middle
age
stood
in
the
doorway
the
sad
shepherd
saluted
him
and
told
his
name
i
am
joseph
the
carpenter
of
nazareth
replied
the
man
have
you
also
seen
the
angels
of
whom
your
brother
shepherds
came
to
tell
us
i
have
seen
no
angels
answered
ammiel
nor
have
i
any
brothers
among
the
shepherds
but
i
would
fain
see
what
they
have
seen
it
is
our
son
said
joseph
and
the
most
high
has
sent
him
to
us
he
is
a
marvellous
child
great
things
are
foretold
of
him
you
may
go
in
but
quietly
for
the
child
and
his
mother
mary
are
asleep
so
the
sad
shepherd
went
in
quietly
his
long
shadow
entered
before
him
for
the
sunrise
was
flowing
into
the
door
of
the
grotto
it
was
made
clean
and
put
in
order
and
a
bed
of
straw
was
laid
in
the
corner
on
the
ground
the
child
was
asleep
but
the
young
mother
was
waking
for
she
had
taken
him
from
the
manger
into
her
lap
where
her
maiden
veil
of
white
was
spread
to
receive
him
and
she
was
singing
very
softly
as
she
bent
over
him
in
wonder
and
content
ammiel
saluted
her
and
kneeled
down
to
look
at
the
child
he
saw
nothing
different
from
other
young
children
the
mother
waited
for
him
to
speak
of
angels
as
the
other
shepherds
had
done
the
sad
shepherd
did
not
speak
but
only
looked
and
as
he
looked
his
face
changed
you
have
suffered
pain
and
danger
and
sorrow
for
his
sake
he
said
gently
they
are
past
she
answered
and
for
his
sake
i
have
suffered
them
gladly
he
is
very
little
and
helpless
you
must
bear
many
troubles
for
his
sake
to
care
for
him
is
my
joy
and
to
bear
him
lightens
my
burden
he
does
not
know
you
he
can
do
nothing
for
you
but
i
know
him
i
have
carried
him
under
my
heart
he
is
my
son
and
my
king
why
do
you
love
him
the
mother
looked
up
at
the
sad
shepherd
with
a
great
reproach
in
her
soft
eyes
then
her
look
grew
pitiful
as
it
rested
on
his
face
you
are
a
sorrowful
man
she
said
i
am
a
wicked
man
he
answered
she
shook
her
head
gently
i
know
nothing
of
that
she
said
but
you
must
be
very
sorrowful
since
you
are
born
of
a
woman
and
yet
you
ask
a
mother
why
she
loves
her
child
i
love
him
for
love
sake
because
god
has
given
him
to
me
so
the
mother
mary
leaned
over
her
little
son
again
and
began
to
croon
a
song
as
if
she
were
alone
with
him
but
ammiel
was
still
there
watching
and
thinking
and
beginning
to
remember
it
came
back
to
him
that
there
was
a
woman
in
galilee
who
had
wept
when
he
was
rebuked
whose
eyes
had
followed
him
when
he
was
unhappy
as
if
she
longed
to
do
something
for
him
whose
voice
had
broken
and
dropped
silent
while
she
covered
her
face
when
he
went
away
his
thoughts
flowed
swiftly
and
silently
toward
her
and
after
her
like
rapid
waves
of
light
there
was
a
thought
of
her
bending
over
a
little
child
in
her
lap
singing
softly
for
pure
joy
the
child
was
himself
there
was
a
thought
of
her
lifting
a
little
child
to
the
breast
that
had
borne
him
as
a
burden
and
a
pain
to
nourish
him
there
as
a
comfort
and
a
treasure
the
child
was
himself
there
was
a
thought
of
her
watching
and
tending
and
guiding
a
little
child
from
day
to
day
from
year
to
year
putting
tender
arms
around
him
bending
over
his
first
wavering
steps
rejoicing
in
his
joys
wiping
away
the
tears
from
his
eyes
as
he
had
never
tried
to
wipe
her
tears
away
the
child
was
himself
she
had
done
everything
for
the
child
sake
but
what
had
the
child
done
for
her
sake
and
the
child
was
himself
that
was
what
he
had
come
to
the
nightfire
had
burned
out
after
the
darkness
had
grown
thin
and
melted
in
the
thoughts
that
pulsed
through
it
like
rapid
waves
of
light
was
what
he
had
come
to
in
the
early
morning
himself
a
child
in
his
mother
arms
then
he
arose
and
went
out
of
the
grotto
softly
making
the
threefold
sign
of
reverence
and
the
eyes
of
mary
followed
him
with
kind
looks
joseph
of
nazareth
was
still
waiting
outside
the
door
how
was
it
that
you
did
not
see
the
angels
he
asked
were
you
not
with
the
other
shepherds
no
answered
ammiel
i
was
asleep
but
i
have
seen
the
mother
and
the
child
blessed
be
the
house
that
holds
them
you
are
strangely
clad
for
a
shepherd
said
joseph
where
do
you
come
from
from
a
far
country
replied
ammiel
from
a
country
that
you
have
never
visited
where
are
you
going
now
asked
joseph
i
am
going
home
answered
ammiel
to
my
mother
and
my
house
in
galilee
go
in
peace
friend
said
joseph
and
the
sad
shepherd
took
up
his
battered
staff
and
went
on
his
way
rejoicing
