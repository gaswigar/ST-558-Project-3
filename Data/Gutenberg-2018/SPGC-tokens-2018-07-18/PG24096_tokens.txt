chapter
i
during
the
first
week
in
november
the
week
within
the
octave
of
all
souls
durtal
entered
sulpice
at
eight
in
the
evening
he
often
chose
to
turn
into
that
church
because
there
was
a
trained
choir
and
because
he
could
there
examine
himself
at
peace
apart
from
the
crowd
the
ugliness
of
the
nave
with
its
heavy
vaulting
vanished
at
night
the
aisles
were
often
empty
it
was
by
a
few
lamps
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
chide
his
soul
in
secret
as
if
at
home
durtal
sat
down
behind
the
high
altar
on
the
left
in
the
aisle
along
the
rue
de
sulpice
the
lamps
of
the
choir
organ
were
lighted
far
off
in
the
almost
empty
nave
an
ecclesiastic
was
preaching
he
recognized
by
the
unctuousness
of
his
delivery
and
his
oily
accent
a
priest
who
poured
on
his
audience
according
to
his
wont
his
best
known
commonplaces
why
are
they
so
devoid
of
eloquence
thought
durtal
i
have
had
the
curiosity
to
listen
to
many
of
them
and
they
are
much
the
same
they
only
vary
in
the
tones
of
their
voice
according
to
their
temperament
some
are
bruised
down
in
vinegar
others
steeped
in
oil
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
clever
combination
and
he
called
to
mind
orators
petted
like
tenors
monsabré
didon
those
coquelins
of
the
church
and
lower
yet
than
those
products
of
the
catholic
training
school
that
bellicose
booby
the
abbé
afterwards
he
continued
come
the
mediocrities
each
puffed
by
the
handful
of
devotees
who
listen
to
them
if
those
cooks
of
the
soul
had
any
skill
if
they
served
their
clients
with
delicate
meats
theological
essences
gravies
of
prayer
concentrated
sauces
of
ideas
they
would
vegetate
misunderstood
by
their
flocks
so
on
the
whole
it
is
all
for
the
best
the
mark
of
the
clergy
must
conform
to
the
level
of
the
faithful
and
indeed
providence
has
provided
carefully
for
this
a
stamping
of
shoes
then
the
movement
of
chairs
grinding
on
the
flags
interrupted
him
the
sermon
was
over
then
a
great
stillness
was
broken
by
a
prelude
from
the
organ
which
dropped
to
a
low
tone
a
mere
accompaniment
to
the
voices
a
slow
and
mournful
chant
arose
the
de
profundis
the
blended
voices
sounded
under
the
arches
intermingling
with
the
somewhat
raw
sounds
of
the
harmonicas
like
the
sharp
tones
of
breaking
glass
resting
on
the
low
accompaniment
of
the
organ
aided
by
basses
so
hollow
that
they
seemed
to
have
descended
into
themselves
as
it
were
underground
they
sprang
out
chanting
the
verse
de
profundis
ad
te
clamavi
do
and
then
stopped
in
fatigue
letting
the
last
syllables
mine
fall
like
a
heavy
tear
then
these
voices
of
children
near
breaking
took
up
the
second
verse
of
the
psalm
domine
exaudi
vocem
meam
and
the
second
half
of
the
last
word
again
remained
in
suspense
but
instead
of
separating
and
falling
to
the
ground
there
to
be
crushed
out
like
a
drop
it
seemed
to
gather
itself
together
with
a
supreme
effort
and
fling
to
heaven
the
anguished
cry
of
the
disincarnate
soul
cast
naked
and
in
tears
before
god
and
after
a
pause
the
organ
aided
by
two
bellowed
out
carrying
all
the
voices
in
its
torrent
baritones
tenors
basses
not
now
serving
only
as
sheaths
to
the
sharp
blades
of
the
urchin
voices
but
openly
with
full
throated
sound
yet
the
dash
of
the
little
soprani
pierced
them
through
all
at
once
like
a
crystal
arrow
then
a
fresh
pause
and
in
the
silence
of
the
church
the
verses
mourned
out
anew
thrown
up
by
the
organ
as
by
a
spring
board
as
he
listened
with
attention
endeavouring
to
resolve
the
sounds
closing
his
eyes
durtal
saw
them
at
first
almost
horizontal
then
rising
little
by
little
then
raising
themselves
upright
then
quivering
in
tears
before
their
final
breaking
suddenly
at
the
end
of
the
psalm
when
the
response
of
the
antiphon
came
et
lux
perpetua
luceat
eis
the
children
voices
broke
into
a
sad
silken
cry
a
sharp
sob
trembling
on
the
word
eis
which
remained
suspended
in
the
void
these
children
voices
stretched
to
breaking
these
clear
sharp
voices
threw
into
the
darkness
of
the
chant
some
whiteness
of
the
dawn
joining
their
pure
soft
sounds
to
the
resonant
tones
of
the
basses
piercing
as
with
a
jet
of
living
silver
the
sombre
cataract
of
the
deeper
singers
they
sharpened
the
wailing
strengthened
and
embittered
the
burning
salt
of
tears
but
they
insinuated
also
a
sort
of
protecting
caress
balsamic
freshness
lustral
help
they
lighted
in
the
darkness
those
brief
gleams
which
tinkle
in
the
angelus
at
dawn
of
day
they
called
up
anticipating
the
prophecies
of
the
text
the
compassionate
image
of
the
virgin
passing
in
the
pale
light
of
their
tones
into
the
darkness
of
that
sequence
the
de
profundis
so
chanted
was
incomparably
beautiful
that
sublime
prayer
ending
in
sobs
at
the
moment
when
the
soul
of
the
voices
was
about
to
overpass
human
limits
gave
a
wrench
to
durtal
nerves
and
made
his
heart
beat
then
he
wished
to
abstract
himself
and
cling
especially
to
the
meaning
of
that
sorrowful
plaint
in
which
the
fallen
being
calls
upon
its
god
with
groans
and
lamentations
those
cries
of
the
third
verse
came
back
to
him
wherein
calling
on
his
saviour
in
despair
from
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
man
now
that
he
knows
he
is
heard
hesitates
ashamed
knowing
not
what
to
say
the
excuses
he
has
prepared
appear
to
him
vain
the
arguments
he
has
arranged
seem
to
him
of
no
effect
and
he
stammers
forth
if
thou
o
lord
shalt
observe
iniquities
lord
who
shall
endure
it
it
is
a
pity
said
durtal
to
himself
that
this
psalm
which
in
its
first
verses
chants
so
magnificently
the
despair
of
humanity
becomes
in
those
which
follow
more
personal
to
king
david
i
know
well
he
went
on
that
we
must
accept
the
symbolic
sense
of
this
pleading
admit
that
the
despot
confounds
his
own
cause
with
that
of
god
that
his
adversaries
are
the
unbelievers
and
the
wicked
that
he
himself
according
to
the
doctors
of
the
church
prefigures
the
person
of
christ
but
yet
the
memory
of
his
fleshly
desires
and
the
presumptuous
praise
he
gives
to
his
incorrigible
people
contracts
the
scope
of
the
poem
happily
the
melody
has
a
life
apart
from
the
text
a
life
of
its
own
not
arising
out
of
mere
tribal
dissensions
but
extending
to
all
the
earth
chanting
the
anguish
of
the
time
to
be
born
as
well
as
of
the
present
day
and
of
the
ages
which
are
no
more
the
de
profundis
had
ceased
after
a
silence
the
choir
intoned
a
motet
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
durtal
was
only
moderately
interested
in
human
music
in
churches
what
seemed
to
him
superior
to
the
most
vaunted
works
of
theatrical
or
worldly
music
was
the
old
plain
chant
that
even
and
naked
melody
at
once
ethereal
and
of
the
tomb
the
solemn
cry
of
sadness
and
lofty
shout
of
joy
those
grandiose
hymns
of
human
faith
which
seem
to
well
up
in
the
cathedrals
like
irresistible
geysers
at
the
very
foot
of
the
romanesque
columns
what
music
however
ample
sorrowful
or
tender
is
worth
the
de
profundis
chanted
in
unison
the
solemnity
of
the
magnificat
the
splendid
warmth
of
the
lauda
sion
the
enthusiasm
of
the
salve
regina
the
sorrow
of
the
miserere
and
the
stabat
mater
the
majestic
omnipotence
of
the
te
deum
artists
of
genius
have
set
themselves
to
translate
the
sacred
texts
vittoria
josquin
de
près
palestrina
orlando
lasso
handel
bach
haydn
have
written
wonderful
pages
often
indeed
they
have
been
uplifted
by
the
mystic
effluence
the
very
emanation
of
the
middle
ages
for
ever
lost
and
yet
their
works
have
retained
a
certain
pomp
and
in
spite
of
all
are
pretentious
as
opposed
to
the
humble
magnificence
the
sober
splendour
of
the
gregorian
chant
with
them
the
whole
thing
came
to
an
end
for
composers
no
longer
believed
yet
in
modern
times
some
religious
pieces
may
be
cited
of
lesueur
wagner
berlioz
and
cæsar
franck
and
in
these
again
we
are
conscious
of
the
artist
underlying
his
work
the
artist
determined
to
show
his
skill
thinking
to
exalt
his
own
glory
and
therefore
leaving
god
out
we
feel
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
superior
men
but
men
with
their
weaknesses
their
inseparable
vanity
and
even
the
vice
of
their
senses
in
the
liturgical
chant
created
almost
always
anonymously
in
the
depth
of
the
cloisters
was
an
extraterrestrial
well
without
taint
of
sin
or
trace
of
art
it
was
an
uprising
of
souls
already
freed
from
the
slavery
of
the
flesh
an
explosion
of
elevated
tenderness
and
pure
joy
it
was
also
the
idiom
of
the
church
a
musical
gospel
appealing
like
the
gospel
itself
at
once
to
the
most
refined
and
the
most
humble
ah
the
true
proof
of
catholicism
was
that
art
which
it
had
founded
an
art
which
has
never
been
surpassed
in
painting
and
sculpture
the
early
masters
mystics
in
poetry
and
in
prose
in
music
plain
chant
in
architecture
the
romanesque
and
gothic
styles
and
all
this
held
together
and
blazed
in
one
sheaf
on
one
and
the
same
altar
all
was
reconciled
in
one
unique
cluster
of
thoughts
to
revere
adore
and
serve
the
dispenser
showing
to
him
reflected
in
the
soul
of
his
creature
as
in
a
faithful
mirror
the
still
immaculate
treasure
of
his
gifts
then
in
those
marvellous
middle
ages
wherein
art
of
the
church
encroached
on
death
and
advanced
to
the
threshold
of
eternity
and
to
god
the
divine
concept
and
the
heavenly
form
were
guessed
and
for
the
first
and
perhaps
for
the
last
time
by
man
they
answered
and
echoed
each
other
art
calling
to
art
the
virgins
had
faces
elongated
like
those
ogives
which
the
gothic
style
contrived
in
order
to
distribute
an
ascetic
light
a
virginal
dawn
in
the
mysterious
shrine
of
its
naves
in
the
pictures
of
the
early
masters
the
complexion
of
holy
women
becomes
transparent
as
paschal
wax
and
their
hair
is
pale
as
golden
grains
of
frankincense
their
childlike
bosoms
scarcely
swell
their
brows
are
rounded
like
the
glass
of
the
pyx
their
fingers
taper
their
bodies
shoot
upwards
like
delicate
columns
their
beauty
becomes
as
it
were
liturgical
they
seem
to
live
in
the
fire
of
stained
glass
borrowing
from
the
flaming
whirlwind
of
the
the
circles
of
their
aureoles
the
ardent
blue
of
their
eyes
the
dying
embers
of
their
lips
keeping
for
their
garments
the
colours
they
disdain
for
their
flesh
stripping
them
of
their
light
changing
them
when
they
transfer
them
to
stuffs
into
opaque
tones
which
aid
still
more
by
their
contrast
to
declare
the
seraphic
clearness
of
their
look
the
grievous
paleness
of
the
mouth
to
which
according
to
the
proper
of
the
season
the
scent
of
the
lily
of
the
canticles
or
the
penitential
fragrance
of
myrrh
in
the
psalms
lend
their
perfume
then
among
artists
was
a
coalition
of
brains
a
welding
together
of
souls
painters
associated
themselves
in
the
same
ideal
of
beauty
with
architects
they
united
in
an
indestructible
relation
cathedrals
and
saints
only
reversing
the
usual
process
they
framed
the
jewel
according
to
the
shrine
and
modelled
the
relics
for
the
reliquary
on
their
side
the
sequences
chanted
by
the
church
had
subtle
affinities
with
the
canvases
of
the
early
painters
vittoria
responses
for
tenebræ
are
of
a
like
inspiration
and
an
equal
loftiness
with
those
of
quentin
matsys
great
work
the
entombment
of
christ
the
regina
coeli
of
the
flemish
musician
lasso
has
the
same
good
faith
the
same
simple
and
strange
attraction
as
certain
statues
of
a
reredos
or
religious
pictures
of
the
elder
breughel
lastly
the
miserere
of
josquin
de
près
choirmaster
of
louis
has
like
the
panels
of
the
early
masters
of
burgundy
and
flanders
a
patient
intention
a
stiff
threadlike
simplicity
but
also
it
exhales
like
them
a
truly
mystical
savour
and
its
awkwardness
of
outline
is
very
touching
the
ideal
of
all
these
works
is
the
same
and
attained
by
different
means
as
for
plain
chant
the
agreement
of
its
melody
with
architecture
is
also
certain
it
also
bends
from
time
to
time
like
the
sombre
romanesque
arcades
and
rises
shadowy
and
pensive
like
complete
vaulting
the
de
profundis
for
instance
curves
in
on
itself
like
those
great
groins
which
form
the
smoky
skeleton
of
the
bays
it
is
like
them
slow
and
dark
extends
itself
only
in
obscurity
and
moves
only
in
the
shadow
of
the
crypts
sometimes
on
the
other
hand
the
gregorian
chant
seems
to
borrow
from
gothic
its
flowery
tendrils
its
scattered
pinnacles
its
gauzy
rolls
its
tremulous
lace
its
trimmings
light
and
thin
as
the
voices
of
children
then
it
passes
from
one
extreme
to
another
from
the
amplitude
of
sorrow
to
an
infinite
joy
at
other
times
again
the
plain
music
and
the
christian
music
to
which
it
gave
birth
lend
themselves
like
sculpture
to
the
gaiety
of
the
people
associate
themselves
with
simple
gladness
and
the
sculptured
merriment
of
the
ancient
porches
they
take
the
popular
rhythm
of
the
crowd
as
in
the
christmas
carol
adeste
fideles
and
in
the
paschal
hymn
o
filii
et
filiæ
they
become
trivial
and
familiar
like
the
gospels
submitting
themselves
to
the
humble
wishes
of
the
poor
lending
them
a
holiday
tune
easy
to
catch
a
running
melody
which
carries
them
into
pure
regions
where
these
simple
souls
can
cast
themselves
at
the
indulgent
feet
of
christ
born
of
the
church
and
bred
up
by
her
in
the
of
the
middle
ages
plain
chant
is
the
aerial
and
mobile
paraphrase
of
the
immovable
structure
of
the
cathedrals
it
is
the
immaterial
and
fluid
interpretation
of
the
canvases
of
the
early
painters
it
is
a
winged
translation
but
also
the
strict
and
unbending
stole
of
those
latin
sequences
which
the
monks
built
up
or
hewed
out
in
the
cloisters
in
the
olden
time
now
it
is
changed
and
disconnected
foolishly
overwhelmed
by
the
crash
of
organs
and
is
chanted
god
knows
how
most
choirs
when
they
intone
it
like
to
imitate
the
rumbling
and
gurgling
of
others
the
grating
of
rattles
the
creaking
of
pullies
the
grinding
of
a
crane
but
in
spite
of
all
its
beauty
remains
unextinguished
dulled
though
it
be
by
the
wild
bellowing
of
the
singers
the
sudden
silence
in
the
church
roused
durtal
he
rose
and
looked
about
him
in
his
corner
was
no
one
save
two
poor
women
asleep
their
feet
on
the
bars
of
chairs
their
heads
on
their
knees
leaning
forward
a
little
he
saw
hanging
above
him
in
a
dark
chapel
the
light
of
a
lamp
like
a
ruby
in
its
red
glass
no
sound
save
the
military
tread
of
the
suisse
making
his
round
in
the
distance
durtal
sat
down
again
the
sweetness
of
his
solitude
was
enhanced
by
the
aromatic
perfume
of
wax
and
the
memories
now
faint
of
incense
but
it
was
suddenly
broken
as
the
first
chords
crashed
on
the
organ
durtal
recognized
the
dies
iræ
that
despairing
hymn
of
the
middle
ages
instinctively
he
bowed
his
head
and
listened
this
was
no
more
as
in
the
de
profundis
an
humble
supplication
a
suffering
which
believes
it
has
been
heard
and
discerns
a
path
of
light
to
guide
it
in
the
darkness
no
longer
the
prayer
which
has
hope
enough
not
to
tremble
it
was
the
cry
of
absolute
desolation
and
of
terror
and
indeed
the
wrath
divine
breathed
tempestuously
through
these
stanzas
they
seemed
addressed
less
to
the
god
of
mercy
to
the
son
who
listens
to
prayer
than
to
the
inflexible
father
to
him
whom
the
old
testament
shows
us
overcome
with
anger
scarcely
appeased
by
the
smoke
of
the
pyres
the
inconceivable
attractions
of
in
this
chant
it
asserted
itself
still
more
savagely
for
it
threatened
to
strike
the
waters
and
break
in
pieces
the
mountains
and
to
rend
asunder
the
depths
of
heaven
by
and
the
earth
alarmed
cried
out
in
fear
a
crystalline
voice
a
clear
child
voice
proclaimed
in
the
nave
the
tidings
of
these
cataclysms
and
after
this
the
choir
chanted
new
strophes
wherein
the
implacable
judge
came
with
shattering
blare
of
trumpet
to
purify
by
fire
the
rottenness
of
the
world
then
in
its
turn
a
bass
deep
as
a
vault
as
though
issuing
from
the
crypt
accentuated
the
horror
of
these
prophecies
made
these
threats
more
overwhelming
and
after
a
short
strain
by
the
choir
an
alto
repeated
them
in
yet
more
detail
then
so
soon
as
the
awful
poem
had
exhausted
the
enumeration
of
chastisement
and
suffering
in
shrill
tones
the
falsetto
of
a
little
boy
the
name
of
jesus
went
by
and
a
light
broke
in
on
the
the
panting
universe
cried
for
pardon
recalling
by
all
the
voices
of
the
choir
the
infinite
mercies
of
the
saviour
and
his
pardon
pleading
with
him
for
absolution
as
formerly
he
had
spared
the
penitent
thief
and
the
magdalen
but
in
the
same
despairing
and
headstrong
melody
the
tempest
raged
again
drowned
with
its
waves
the
shores
of
heaven
and
the
solos
continued
discouraged
interrupted
by
the
recurrent
weeping
of
the
choir
giving
with
the
diversity
of
voices
a
body
to
the
special
conditions
of
shame
the
particular
states
of
fear
the
different
ages
of
tears
at
last
when
still
mixed
and
blended
these
voices
had
borne
away
on
the
great
waters
of
the
organ
all
the
wreckage
of
human
sorrows
all
the
buoys
of
prayers
and
tears
they
fell
exhausted
paralyzed
by
terror
wailing
and
sighing
like
a
child
who
hides
its
face
stammering
dona
eis
requiem
they
ended
worn
out
in
an
amen
so
plaintive
that
it
died
away
in
a
breath
above
the
sobbing
of
the
organ
what
man
could
have
imagined
such
despair
dreamed
of
such
disasters
and
durtal
made
answer
to
himself
no
man
in
fact
the
attempt
has
been
vain
to
discover
the
author
both
of
the
music
and
of
the
sequence
they
have
been
attributed
to
frangipani
thomas
of
celano
bernard
and
a
crowd
of
others
and
they
have
remained
anonymous
simply
formed
by
the
sad
alluvial
deposits
of
the
age
the
dies
iræ
seemed
to
have
at
first
fallen
like
a
seed
of
desolation
among
the
distracted
souls
of
the
eleventh
century
it
germinated
there
and
grew
slowly
nurtured
by
the
sap
of
anguish
watered
by
the
rain
of
tears
it
was
at
last
pruned
when
it
seemed
ripe
and
had
perhaps
thrown
out
too
many
branches
for
in
one
of
the
earliest
known
texts
a
stanza
which
has
since
disappeared
called
up
the
magnificent
and
barbarous
image
of
an
earth
revolving
as
it
belched
forth
flames
while
the
constellations
burst
into
shards
and
heaven
shrivelled
like
a
parched
scroll
all
this
concluded
durtal
does
not
prevent
these
triple
stanzas
woven
of
shadow
and
cold
full
of
reverberating
rhymes
and
hard
echoes
this
music
of
rude
stuff
which
wraps
the
phrases
like
a
shroud
and
masks
the
rigid
outlines
of
the
work
from
being
admirable
yet
that
chant
which
constrains
and
renders
with
such
energy
the
breadth
of
the
sequence
that
melodic
period
which
without
variation
remaining
always
the
same
succeeds
in
expressing
by
turns
prayer
and
terror
moves
me
less
than
the
profundis
which
yet
has
not
its
grandiose
spaciousness
nor
that
artistic
cry
of
despair
but
chanted
to
the
organ
the
psalm
is
earthy
and
suffocating
it
comes
from
out
the
very
depths
of
the
sepulchre
while
the
iræ
has
its
source
only
on
the
sill
of
the
tomb
the
first
is
the
very
voice
of
the
dead
the
second
that
of
the
living
who
inter
him
and
the
dead
man
weeps
but
takes
courage
a
little
when
those
that
bury
him
despair
to
sum
up
durtal
concluded
i
prefer
the
text
of
the
iræ
to
that
of
the
profundis
and
the
melody
of
the
profundis
to
that
of
the
iræ
it
is
true
also
that
this
last
sequence
is
modernized
and
chanted
theatrically
here
without
the
imposing
and
needful
march
of
unison
this
time
for
instance
it
is
devoid
of
interest
he
continued
ceasing
his
thoughts
for
a
moment
to
listen
to
the
piece
of
modern
music
which
the
choir
was
just
then
rendering
ah
who
will
take
on
himself
to
proscribe
that
pert
mysticism
those
fonts
of
which
gounod
invented
there
ought
indeed
to
be
astonishing
penalties
for
choir
masters
who
allow
such
musical
effeminacy
in
church
this
is
as
it
was
this
morning
at
the
madeleine
when
i
happened
to
be
present
at
the
interminable
funeral
of
an
old
banker
they
played
a
military
march
with
violin
and
violoncello
accompaniments
with
trumpets
and
timbrels
a
heroic
and
worldly
march
to
celebrate
the
departure
and
the
decomposition
of
a
financier
it
is
too
absurd
and
listening
no
more
to
the
music
in
sulpice
durtal
transferred
himself
in
thought
to
the
madeleine
and
went
off
at
full
speed
in
his
dreams
indeed
he
said
to
himself
the
clergy
make
jesus
like
a
tourist
when
they
invite
him
daily
to
come
down
into
that
church
whose
exterior
is
surmounted
by
no
cross
and
whose
interior
is
like
the
grand
at
an
hotel
but
how
can
you
make
those
priests
understand
that
ugliness
is
sacrilege
and
that
nothing
is
equal
to
the
frightful
sin
of
this
confusion
of
romanesque
and
greek
these
pictures
of
aged
men
that
flat
ceiling
studded
with
skylights
from
which
filter
in
all
weathers
the
spoiled
gleams
of
a
rainy
day
to
that
futile
altar
surmounted
by
a
circle
of
angels
who
in
discreet
abandonment
dance
in
honour
of
our
lady
a
motionless
marble
rigadoon
yet
in
the
madeleine
at
a
funeral
when
the
door
opens
and
the
corpse
advances
in
a
gap
of
daylight
all
is
changed
like
a
superterrestrial
antiseptic
an
extrahuman
disinfectant
the
liturgy
purifies
and
cleanses
the
impious
ugliness
of
the
place
and
thinking
over
his
memories
of
the
morning
durtal
saw
again
as
he
closed
his
eyes
at
the
end
of
the
semicircular
apse
the
procession
of
red
and
black
robes
white
surplices
joining
in
front
of
the
altar
descending
the
steps
together
making
their
way
together
to
the
catafalque
dividing
again
on
each
aide
joining
to
mix
afresh
in
the
great
gangway
between
the
chairs
this
slow
and
silent
procession
led
by
incomparable
suisses
in
mourning
their
swords
horizontal
and
a
general
epaulets
in
jet
advanced
preceded
by
a
cross
in
front
of
the
corpse
laid
on
tressels
and
in
all
that
confusion
of
lights
falling
from
the
roof
and
lighted
flambeaux
round
the
catafalque
and
on
the
altar
the
white
of
the
tapers
disappeared
and
the
priests
who
bore
them
seemed
to
march
with
empty
hands
uplifted
as
though
to
point
out
the
stars
which
accompanied
them
twinkling
above
their
heads
then
when
the
bier
was
surrounded
by
the
clergy
the
de
profundis
burst
forth
from
the
depths
of
the
sanctuary
intoned
by
invisible
singers
that
was
good
said
durtal
to
himself
at
the
madeleine
the
voices
of
the
children
are
sharp
and
feeble
and
the
basses
are
badly
trained
and
failing
we
are
evidently
far
from
the
choir
of
sulpice
but
all
the
same
it
was
superb
then
what
a
moment
was
that
of
the
communion
when
suddenly
arising
from
the
murmuring
of
the
choir
the
voice
of
the
tenor
threw
above
the
corpse
the
magnificent
plain
chant
antiphon
requiem
æternam
dona
eis
domine
et
lux
perpetua
luceat
eis
it
seems
that
after
all
the
lamentations
of
the
de
profundis
and
the
dies
iræ
the
presence
of
god
who
comes
then
upon
the
altar
brings
consolation
and
sanctions
the
confident
and
solemn
pride
of
that
melodious
phrase
which
then
invokes
christ
without
dread
and
without
tears
the
mass
ended
the
celebrant
disappeared
and
as
at
the
moment
when
the
corpse
entered
the
clergy
preceded
by
the
suisses
advanced
towards
the
body
and
in
the
blazing
circle
of
the
tapers
a
priest
in
his
cope
said
the
mighty
prayers
of
the
general
absolution
then
the
liturgy
took
a
higher
tone
and
became
still
more
admirable
mediative
between
the
sinner
and
the
judge
the
church
by
the
mouth
of
her
priest
implores
the
lord
to
pardon
the
poor
soul
non
intres
in
judicium
cum
servo
tuo
domine
then
after
the
amen
given
by
the
organ
and
all
the
choir
a
voice
arose
in
the
silence
and
spoke
in
the
name
of
the
dead
libera
me
and
the
choir
continued
the
old
chant
of
the
tenth
century
just
as
in
the
dies
iræ
which
appropriates
to
itself
fragments
of
these
plaints
the
last
judgment
flamed
out
and
pitiless
responses
declare
to
the
dead
the
reality
of
his
alarms
declare
to
him
that
at
the
end
of
time
the
judge
will
come
with
the
crash
of
thunder
to
chastise
the
world
the
priest
marched
round
the
catafalque
sprinkling
it
with
beads
of
holy
water
incensed
it
gave
shelter
to
the
poor
weeping
soul
consoled
it
took
it
to
himself
covered
it
as
it
were
with
his
cope
and
again
intervened
to
pray
that
after
so
much
weariness
and
sorrow
the
lord
will
permit
the
unhappy
one
to
sleep
the
sleep
that
knows
no
waking
far
from
earth
noises
never
in
any
religion
has
a
more
charitable
part
a
more
august
mission
been
assigned
to
man
lifted
by
his
consecration
wholly
above
humanity
almost
deified
by
the
sacerdotal
office
the
priest
while
earth
laments
or
is
silent
can
advance
to
the
brink
of
the
abyss
and
intercede
for
the
being
whom
the
church
has
baptized
as
an
infant
who
has
no
doubt
forgotten
her
since
that
day
and
may
even
have
persecuted
her
up
to
the
hour
of
his
death
nor
does
the
church
shrink
from
the
task
before
that
fleshly
dust
heaped
in
a
chest
she
thinks
of
that
sewage
of
the
soul
and
cries
from
the
gates
of
hell
deliver
him
o
lord
but
at
the
end
of
the
general
absolution
at
the
moment
when
the
procession
turning
its
back
is
on
the
way
to
the
sacristy
she
too
seems
disquieted
perhaps
recalling
in
an
instant
the
ill
deeds
done
by
that
body
while
it
was
alive
she
seemed
to
doubt
if
her
supplications
were
heard
and
the
doubt
her
words
would
not
frame
passed
into
the
intonation
of
the
last
amen
murmured
at
the
madeleine
by
children
voices
timid
and
distant
plaintive
and
sweet
this
amen
said
we
have
done
what
we
could
but
but
and
in
the
funereal
silence
which
followed
the
clergy
leaving
the
nave
there
remained
only
the
ignoble
reality
of
the
empty
husk
lifted
in
the
arms
of
men
thrust
into
a
carriage
like
the
refuse
of
the
shambles
carted
off
each
morning
to
be
made
into
soap
at
the
factories
if
continued
durtal
in
opposition
to
these
sad
prayers
these
eloquent
absolutions
we
call
up
before
us
a
marriage
mass
all
is
changed
there
the
church
is
disarmed
and
her
musical
liturgy
is
as
nought
then
she
may
well
play
mendelssohn
wedding
march
and
borrow
from
profane
authors
the
gaiety
of
their
songs
to
celebrate
the
brief
and
empty
joy
of
the
body
imagine
and
indeed
it
happens
the
canticle
of
the
virgin
used
to
magnify
the
glad
impatience
of
a
bride
fancy
the
te
deum
to
hymn
the
blessedness
of
a
bridegroom
far
away
from
this
infamous
barter
of
the
flesh
plain
chant
remains
shut
up
in
the
antiphonaries
like
a
monk
in
the
cloister
and
when
it
goes
forth
it
is
to
cast
up
before
christ
his
garnered
pains
and
sorrows
it
gathers
and
sums
them
up
in
admirable
supplications
and
if
fatigued
with
pleading
it
adores
its
impulse
is
to
glorify
eternal
events
palm
sunday
and
easter
pentecost
and
the
ascension
epiphany
and
christmas
then
its
joy
bursts
forth
so
magnificently
that
it
springs
beyond
the
world
to
show
its
ecstatic
joy
at
the
feet
of
god
as
to
the
very
ceremonies
of
the
funeral
they
are
now
only
the
regular
way
of
getting
money
an
official
routine
a
which
is
turned
mechanically
without
thought
of
it
the
organist
while
he
plays
thinks
of
his
family
and
considers
how
wearied
he
is
the
thinks
as
he
fills
the
pipes
of
the
which
will
dry
his
sweat
the
tenors
and
basses
are
careful
of
their
effects
and
admire
themselves
in
the
more
or
less
rippled
water
of
their
voices
the
choir
boys
dream
of
their
scampers
after
mass
and
moreover
not
one
of
them
at
all
understands
a
word
of
the
latin
they
sing
and
abridge
as
for
instance
the
dies
iræ
of
which
they
suppress
a
part
of
the
stanzas
in
its
turn
beadledom
calculates
the
sum
the
dead
man
brings
in
and
even
the
priest
wearied
with
the
prayers
of
which
he
has
read
so
many
and
needing
his
breakfast
prays
mechanically
from
the
lips
outward
while
the
assistants
are
in
a
hurry
that
the
mass
to
which
they
have
not
listened
should
come
to
an
end
that
they
may
shake
hands
with
the
relations
and
leave
the
dead
there
is
absolute
inattention
profound
weariness
yet
how
terrible
is
that
thing
on
the
tressels
that
is
waiting
there
in
the
church
that
empty
that
body
which
is
already
breaking
up
liquid
manure
that
stinks
gases
which
evaporate
flesh
that
rots
is
all
that
remains
and
the
soul
now
that
life
is
over
and
all
begins
no
one
thinks
of
it
not
even
the
family
worn
out
by
the
length
of
the
service
absorbed
in
their
own
sorrow
who
in
fact
regret
only
the
visible
presence
of
the
being
they
have
lost
no
one
except
myself
thought
durtal
and
a
few
curious
people
who
associate
themselves
in
their
alarm
with
the
dies
iræ
and
the
libera
of
which
they
understand
both
the
language
and
the
meaning
then
by
the
external
sound
of
the
words
without
the
aid
of
contemplation
without
even
the
help
of
thought
the
church
acts
there
it
is
the
miracle
of
her
liturgy
the
power
of
her
word
the
constantly
renewed
prodigy
of
phrases
created
by
revolving
time
of
prayers
arranged
by
ages
which
are
dead
all
has
passed
nothing
exists
that
was
raised
up
in
those
bygone
times
yet
those
sequences
remain
intact
cried
aloud
by
indifferent
voices
and
cast
out
from
empty
hearts
plead
groan
and
implore
even
with
efficacy
by
their
virtual
power
their
talismanic
might
their
inalienable
beauty
by
the
almighty
confidence
of
their
faith
the
middle
ages
have
left
us
these
to
help
us
to
save
if
it
may
be
the
soul
of
the
modern
and
dead
fine
gentleman
at
the
present
time
concluded
durtal
there
is
nothing
left
peculiar
to
paris
but
the
ceremonies
very
like
each
other
of
taking
the
veil
and
of
funerals
it
is
unfortunate
that
when
we
have
to
do
with
a
sumptuous
corpse
undertakers
have
their
way
they
then
bring
out
their
terrible
upholstery
plated
statues
of
our
lady
in
atrocious
taste
zinc
basins
in
which
blaze
bowls
of
green
punch
tin
candelabra
at
the
end
of
a
branch
like
a
cannon
on
end
with
its
mouth
upwards
supporting
spiders
on
their
backs
with
burning
candles
set
about
their
legs
all
the
funeral
ironmongery
of
the
first
empire
with
curtain
rods
in
relief
acanthus
leaves
winged
lozenges
and
greek
frets
it
is
unfortunate
too
that
to
touch
up
the
miserable
furniture
of
these
ceremonies
they
play
massenet
and
dubois
benjamin
godard
and
widor
or
worse
still
the

orchestra
mystical
bellowing
such
as
the
women
sing
who
are
affiliated
to
the
confraternities
of
the
month
of
may
and
alas
we
hear
no
longer
the
tempests
of
the
great
organs
and
the
majestic
dolours
of
plain
chant
save
at
the
funerals
of
the
monied
classes
for
the
poor
nothing
no
choir
no
organ
just
a
handful
of
prayers
then
a
few
dips
of
the
brush

holy
water
stoup
and
there
is
a
dead
man
the
more
on
whom
the
rain
falls
who
is
carried
away
but
the
church
knows
that
the
carrion
of
the
rich
rots
as
much
as
that
of
the
poor
while
his
soul
stinks
more
but
she
jobs
indulgences
and
haggles
about
masses
she
even
she
is
consumed
by
the
lust
of
gold
yet
i
must
not
think
too
ill
of
these
wealthy
fools
said
durtal
after
silent
thought
for
after
all
it
is
thanks
to
them
that
i
can
hear
the
admirable
liturgy
of
the
burial
service
these
people
who
perhaps
have
done
no
good
action
in
their
life
do
at
least
this
kindness
to
a
few
without
knowing
it
after
their
death
a
noise
recalled
him
to
sulpice
the
choir
was
going
the
church
was
about
to
close
i
might
as
well
have
tried
to
pray
he
said
to
himself
it
would
have
been
better
than
to
dream
in
the
empty
church
on
a
chair
pray
indeed
i
have
no
desire
for
it
i
am
haunted
by
catholicism
intoxicated
by
its
atmosphere
of
incense
and
wax
i
prowl
about
it
moved
even
to
tears
by
its
prayers
touched
even
to
the
marrow
by
its
psalms
and
chants
i
am
thoroughly
disgusted
with
my
life
very
tired
of
myself
but
it
is
a
far
cry
from
that
to
leading
a
different
existence
and
yet
and
yet
if
i
am
perturbed
in
these
chapels
i
become
unmoved
and
dry
again
as
soon
as
i
leave
them
after
all
he
said
to
himself
getting
up
and
following
the
few
persons
who
were
moving
towards
a
door
driven
out
by
the
suisse
after
all
my
heart
is
hardened
and
by
dissipation
i
am
good
for
nothing
chapter
ii
how
had
he
again
become
a
catholic
and
got
to
this
point
durtal
answered
himself
i
can
not
tell
all
that
i
know
is
that
having
been
for
years
an
unbeliever
i
suddenly
believe
let
us
see
he
said
to
himself
let
us
try
at
least
to
consider
if
however
great
the
obscurity
of
such
a
subject
there
be
not
common
sense
in
it
after
all
my
surprise
depends
on
preconceived
ideas
of
conversions
i
have
heard
of
sudden
and
violent
crises
of
the
soul
of
a
thunderbolt
or
even
of
faith
exploding
at
last
in
ground
slowly
and
cleverly
mined
it
is
quite
evident
that
conversions
may
happen
in
one
or
other
of
these
two
ways
for
god
acts
as
may
seem
good
to
him
but
there
must
be
also
a
third
means
and
this
no
doubt
the
most
usual
which
the
saviour
has
used
in
my
case
and
i
know
not
in
what
this
consists
it
is
something
analogous
to
digestion
in
a
stomach
which
works
though
we
do
not
feel
it
there
has
been
no
road
to
damascus
no
events
to
bring
about
a
crisis
nothing
has
happened
we
awake
some
fine
morning
and
without
knowing
how
or
why
the
thing
is
done
yes
but
in
fact
this
manoeuvre
is
very
like
that
of
the
mine
which
only
explodes
after
it
has
been
deeply
dug
yet
not
so
for
in
that
case
the
operations
are
material
the
objections
in
the
way
are
resolved
i
might
have
reasoned
followed
the
course
of
the
spark
along
the
thread
but
in
this
case
no
i
sprang
unexpectedly
without
warning
without
even
having
suspected
that
i
was
so
carefully
sapped
nor
was
it
a
clap
of
thunder
unless
i
admit
that
a
clap
of
thunder
can
be
occult
and
silent
strange
and
gentle
and
this
again
would
be
untrue
for
sudden
disorder
of
the
soul
almost
always
follows
a
misfortune
or
a
crime
an
act
of
which
we
are
aware
no
the
one
thing
which
seems
certain
in
my
case
is
that
there
has
been
divine
impulse
grace
but
said
he
in
that
case
the
psychology
of
conversion
is
worthless
and
he
made
answer
to
himself
that
seems
to
be
so
for
i
seek
in
vain
to
retrace
the
stages
through
which
i
have
passed
no
doubt
i
can
distinguish
here
and
there
some
landmarks
on
the
road
i
have
travelled
love
of
art
heredity
weariness
of
life
i
can
even
recall
some
of
the
forgotten
sensations
of
childhood
the
subterranean
workings
of
ideas
excited
by
my
visits
to
the
churches
but
i
am
unable
to
gather
these
threads
together
and
group
them
in
a
skein
i
can
not
understand
the
sudden
and
silent
explosion
of
light
which
took
place
in
me
when
i
seek
to
explain
to
myself
how
one
evening
an
unbeliever
i
became
without
knowing
it
on
one
night
a
believer
i
can
discover
nothing
for
the
divine
action
has
vanished
and
left
no
trace
it
is
certain
he
continued
after
silent
thought
that
in
these
cases
the
virgin
acts
upon
us
it
is
she
who
moulds
and
places
us
in
the
hands
of
her
son
but
her
fingers
are
so
light
so
supple
so
caressing
that
the
soul
they
have
handled
has
felt
nothing
on
the
other
hand
if
i
ignore
the
course
and
stages
of
my
conversion
i
can
at
least
guess
the
motives
which
after
a
life
of
indifference
have
brought
me
into
the
harbours
of
the
church
made
me
wander
round
about
her
borders
and
finally
gave
me
a
shove
from
behind
to
bring
me
in
and
he
said
to
himself
without
more
ado
there
are
three
causes
first
the
atavism
of
an
old
and
pious
family
scattered
among
the
monasteries
and
the
memories
of
childhood
returned
to
him
of
cousins
of
aunts
seen
in
convent
parlours
gentle
women
and
grave
white
as
wafers
who
alarmed
him
by
their
low
voices
who
troubled
him
by
their
looks
and
asked
if
he
were
a
good
boy
he
felt
a
sort
of
terror
and
hid
himself
in
his
mother
skirts
trembling
when
he
went
away
and
was
obliged
to
bend
his
brow
to
those
colourless
lips
and
undergo
the
touch
of
a
chilly
kiss
now
that
he
thought
of
them
at
a
distance
the
interviews
which
had
wearied
him
so
much
in
his
childhood
seemed
to
him
charming
he
put
into
them
all
the
poetry
of
the
cloister
clothed
those
bare
parlours
with
a
faded
scent
of
wainscotting
and
of
wax
and
he
saw
again
the
convent
gardens
through
which
he
had
passed
impregnated
with
the
bitter
salt
scent
of
box
planted
with
clipped
hedges
intermingled
with
trellises
whose
green
grapes
never
ripened
divided
by
benches
whose
mouldering
stone
kept
the
traces
worn
by
water
and
a
thousand
details
came
back
to
him
of
those
silent
lime
alleys
of
the
paths
where
he
ran
in
the
interlaced
shade
which
branches
threw
upon
the
ground
these
gardens
had
seemed
to
him
to
become
larger
as
he
grew
older
and
he
retained
a
somewhat
confused
memory
of
them
amid
which
was
the
vague
recollection
of
an
old
stately
park
and
of
a
presbytery
orchard
in
the
north
always
somewhat
damp
even
when
the
sun
shone
it
was
not
surprising
that
these
sensations
transformed
by
time
had
left
in
him
some
traces
of
pious
thought
which
grew
deeper
as
his
mind
embellished
them
all
this
might
have
fermented
indistinctly
for
thirty
years
and
now
began
to
work
but
the
two
other
causes
which
he
knew
must
have
been
still
more
active
these
were
his
disgust
for
his
life
and
his
passion
for
art
and
the
disgust
was
certainly
aggravated
by
his
solitude
and
his
idleness
after
having
in
old
days
made
friends
by
chance
and
having
taken
the
impression
of
souls
which
had
nothing
in
common
with
his
own
he
had
at
last
chosen
after
much
useless
vagabondage
he
had
become
the
intimate
friend
of
a
certain
doctor
des
hermies
a
physician
who
devoted
much
attention
to
demoniac
possession
and
to
mysticism
and
of
a
breton
named
carhaix
the
at
sulpice
these
friendships
were
not
like
those
he
had
formerly
made
entirely
superficial
and
external
they
were
wide
and
deep
based
on
similarity
of
thought
and
the
indissoluble
ties
of
soul
and
these
had
been
roughly
broken
within
two
months
of
each
other
des
hermies
and
carhaix
died
the
former
of
typhoid
fever
the
latter
of
a
chill
that
prostrated
him
in
his
tower
after
he
had
rung
the
evening
angelus
these
were
frightful
blows
for
durtal
his
life
now
without
an
anchor
drifted
he
wandered
all
astray
declaring
to
himself
that
this
desolation
was
final
since
he
had
reached
an
age
at
which
new
friends
are
not
made
so
he
lived
alone
apart
among
his
books
but
the
solitude
which
he
bore
bravely
when
he
was
occupied
when
he
was
writing
a
book
became
intolerable
to
him
now
that
he
was
idle
he
lounged
in
an
in
the
afternoons
and
abandoned
himself
to
his
dreams
then
especially
fixed
ideas
took
hold
on
him
and
these
ended
by
playing
pantomimes
of
which
the
scenes
never
varied
behind
the
lowered
curtain
of
his
eyes
nude
figures
danced
in
his
brain
to
the
tune
of
psalms
and
he
woke
from
these
dreams
weak
and
panting
ready
if
a
priest
had
been
there
to
throw
himself
at
his
feet
with
tears
just
as
he
would
have
abandoned
himself
to
the
basest
pleasures
had
the
temptation
suddenly
come
to
him
let
me
chase
away
these
phantoms
by
work
he
cried
but
at
what
should
he
work
he
had
just
published
the
life
of
gilles
de
rais
which
might
interest
a
few
artists
and
he
now
remained
without
a
subject
on
the
hunt
for
a
book
as
in
art
he
was
a
man
of
extremes
he
always
went
from
one
excess
to
the
other
and
after
having
dived
into
the
satanism
of
the
middle
ages
in
his
account
of
marshal
de
rais
he
saw
nothing
so
interesting
to
investigate
as
the
life
of
a
saint
some
lines
which
he
had
discovered
in
görres
and
ribet
studies
in
mysticism
had
put
him
on
the
trace
of
a
certain
blessed
lidwine
in
search
of
new
documents
but
admitting
that
he
could
unearth
anything
about
her
could
he
write
the
life
of
a
saint
he
did
not
believe
it
and
the
arguments
on
which
he
based
his
opinion
seemed
plausible
hagiography
was
now
a
lost
branch
of
art
as
completely
lost
as
wood
carving
and
the
miniatures
of
the
old
missals
nowadays
it
is
only
treated
by
church
officers
and
priests
by
those
stylistic
agents
who
seem
when
they
write
to
put
the
embryos
of
their
ideas
on
ballast
trucks
and
in
their
hands
it
has
become
a
commonplace
of
a
translation
into
a
book
of
the
statuettes
of
froc
robert
and
the
coloured
images
of
bouasse
the
way
then
was
free
and
it
seemed
at
first
easy
enough
to
plan
it
out
but
to
extract
the
charm
of
the
legends
needed
the
simple
language
of
bygone
centuries
the
ingenuous
phrases
of
the
days
that
are
dead
who
in
our
time
can
express
the
melancholy
essence
the
pale
perfume
of
the
ancient
translations
of
the
golden
legend
of
voragine
how
bind
in
one
bright
posy
the
plaintive
flowers
which
the
monks
cultivated
in
their
cloistered
enclosures
when
hagiography
was
the
sister
of
the
barbaric
and
delightful
art
of
the
illuminators
and
glass
stainers
of
the
ardent
and
chaste
paintings
of
the
early
masters
yet
we
may
not
think
of
giving
ourselves
over
to
studious
imitations
nor
coldly
attempt
to
ape
such
works
as
these
the
question
remains
whether
we
can
with
the
present
artistic
resources
succeed
in
setting
up
the
humble
yet
lofty
figure
of
a
saint
and
this
is
at
least
doubtful
for
the
lack
of
real
simplicity
the
art
of
style
the
tricks
of
careful
design
and
the
false
craft
of
colour
would
probably
transform
the
elect
lady
into
a
strolling
player
she
would
be
no
longer
a
saint
but
an
actress
who
rendered
the
part
more
or
less
adroitly
and
then
the
charm
would
be
destroyed
the
miracles
would
seem
mechanical
the
episodes
would
be
absurd
then
then
one
must
have
a
lively
faith
and
believe
in
the
sanctity
of
one
heroine
if
one
would
try
to
exhume
her
and
put
her
alive
again
in
a
book
this
is
so
true
that
we
may
examine
gustave
flaubert
admirable
pages
on
the
legend
of
julian
the
hospitaller
their
development
is
like
a
dazzling
yet
regulated
tumult
evolved
in
superb
language
whose
apparent
simplicity
is
only
due
to
the
complicated
ingenuity
of
consummate
skill
all
is
there
all
except
the
accent
which
would
have
made
this
work
a
true
masterpiece
given
the
subject
the
fire
which
should
course
through
these
magnificent
phrases
is
absent
there
lacks
the
cry
of
the
love
that
faints
the
gift
of
the
superhuman
exile
the
mystical
soul
on
the
other
hand
hello
physionomies
de
saints
are
worth
reading
faith
flashes
out
in
each
of
his
portraits
enthusiasm
runs
over
in
each
chapter
unexpected
allusions
form
deep
reservoirs
of
thought
between
the
lines
but
after
all
hello
was
so
little
of
an
artist
that
the
fairest
legends
fade
when
his
fingers
touch
them
the
meanness
of
his
style
impoverishes
the
miracles
and
renders
them
ineffectual
the
art
is
lacking
which
would
rescue
the
book
from
the
category
of
pale
and
dead
publications
the
example
of
these
two
men
in
complete
opposition
as
ever
writers
were
neither
of
whom
attained
perfection
one
in
the
legend
of
julian
because
faith
was
wanting
the
other
because
his
art
was
poor
and
narrow
thoroughly
discouraged
durtal
he
ought
to
be
both
at
once
and
yet
remain
himself
if
not
there
was
no
good
in
buckling
to
for
such
a
task
it
were
better
to
be
silent
and
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
sullen
and
hopeless
then
the
contempt
of
his
desolate
life
grew
upon
him
and
once
more
he
wondered
what
interest
providence
could
have
in
thus
tormenting
the
descendants
of
the
first
convicts
if
there
were
no
answer
he
was
obliged
to
admit
that
the
church
in
these
disasters
gathered
up
the
waifs
sheltered
the
shipwrecked
brought
them
home
again
and
assured
them
a
no
more
than
schopenhauer
whom
he
had
once
admired
but
whose
plan
of
labelling
every
one
before
death
and
whose
herbarium
of
dry
sorrows
had
wearied
him
has
the
church
deceived
man
nor
sought
to
decoy
him
by
boasting
the
mercy
of
a
life
which
she
knew
to
be
ignoble
in
all
her
inspired
books
she
proclaims
the
horror
of
fate
and
mourns
over
the
enforced
task
of
living
ecclesiasticus
ecclesiastes
the
book
of
job
the
lamentations
of
jeremias
manifest
this
sorrow
in
their
every
line
and
the
middle
ages
too
in
the
imitation
of
jesus
christ
cursed
existence
and
cried
out
loudly
for
death
more
plainly
than
schopenhauer
the
church
declared
that
there
is
nothing
to
wish
for
here
below
nothing
to
expect
but
where
the
mere
catalogues
of
the
philosopher
stop
the
church
went
on
overpassing
the
limits
of
the
senses
declared
the
end
of
man
and
defined
his
limitations
then
he
said
to
himself
if
it
be
well
considered
the
vaunted
argument
of
schopenhauer
against
the
creator
drawn
from
the
misery
and
injustice
of
the
world
is
not
irrefutable
for
the
world
is
not
as
god
made
it
but
as
man
has
refashioned
it
before
accusing
heaven
for
our
ills
it
is
no
doubt
fitting
to
examine
through
what
phases
of
consent
through
what
voluntary
falls
the
creature
has
passed
before
ending
in
the
gloomy
disaster
it
deplores
we
may
well
curse
the
vices
of
our
ancestors
and
our
own
passions
which
beget
the
greater
part
of
the
woes
from
which
we
suffer
we
may
well
loathe
the
civilization
which
has
rendered
life
intolerable
to
cleanly
souls
and
not
the
lord
who
perhaps
did
not
create
us
to
be
shot
down
by
cannon
in
time
of
war
to
be
cheated
robbed
and
stripped
in
time
of
peace
by
the
slave
drivers
of
commerce
and
the
brigands
of
the
money
market
but
that
which
remains
for
ever
incomprehensible
is
the
initial
horror
the
horror
imposed
on
each
of
us
of
having
to
live
and
that
is
a
mystery
no
philosophy
can
explain
ah
he
went
on
when
i
think
of
that
horror
that
disgust
of
existence
which
has
for
years
and
years
increased
in
me
i
understand
how
i
am
forced
to
make
for
the
church
the
only
port
where
i
can
find
shelter
once
i
despised
her
because
i
had
a
staff
on
which
to
lean
when
the
great
winds
of
weariness
blew
i
believed
in
my
novels
i
worked
at
my
history
i
had
my
art
i
have
come
to
recognize
its
absolute
inadequacy
its
complete
incapacity
to
afford
happiness
then
i
understood
that
pessimism
was
at
most
good
to
console
those
who
had
no
real
need
of
comfort
i
understood
that
its
theories
alluring
when
we
are
young
and
rich
and
well
become
singularly
weak
and
lamentably
false
when
age
advances
when
infirmities
declare
themselves
when
all
around
is
crumbling
i
went
to
the
church
that
hospital
for
souls
there
at
least
they
take
you
in
put
you
to
bed
and
nurse
you
they
do
not
merely
turn
their
backs
on
you
as
in
the
wards
of
pessimism
and
tell
you
the
name
of
your
disease
finally
durtal
had
been
brought
back
to
religion
by
art
more
even
than
his
disgust
for
life
art
had
been
the
irresistible
magnet
which
drew
him
to
god
the
day
when
out
of
curiosity
and
to
kill
time
he
had
entered
a
church
and
after
so
many
years
of
forgetfulness
had
heard
the
vespers
for
the
dead
fall
heavily
psalm
after
psalm
in
antiphonal
chant
as
the
singers
threw
up
like
ditchers
their
shovelful
of
verses
his
soul
had
been
shaken
to
its
depths
the
evenings
when
he
had
listened
at
sulpice
to
the
admirable
chanting
during
the
octave
of
all
souls
he
had
felt
himself
caught
once
for
all
but
that
which
had
put
most
pressure
on
him
and
brought
him
yet
more
completely
into
bondage
were
the
ceremonies
and
music
of
holy
week
he
had
visited
the
churches
during
that
week
and
they
had
opened
to
him
like
palaces
ruined
like
cemeteries
laid
waste
by
god
they
were
forbidding
with
their
veiled
images
their
crucifixes
wrapped
in
purple
their
organs
dumb
their
bells
silent
the
crowd
flowed
in
busy
but
noiseless
along
the
floor
over
the
immense
cross
formed
by
the
nave
and
the
two
transepts
and
entering
by
the
wounds
of
which
the
doors
were
figures
they
went
up
to
the
altar
where
the
head
of
christ
would
lie
and
there
on
their
knees
eagerly
kissed
the
crucifix
which
marked
the
place
of
the
chin
below
the
steps
and
the
crowd
itself
as
it
ran
in
the
cruciform
mould
of
the
church
became
itself
an
enormous
cross
living
and
crawling
silent
and
sombre
at
sulpice
where
the
whole
assembled
seminary
lamented
the
ignominy
of
human
justice
and
the
death
of
a
god
durtal
had
followed
the
incomparable
offices
of
those
mournful
days
through
all
their
black
minutes
had
listened
to
the
infinite
sadness
of
the
passion
so
nobly
and
profoundly
expressed
at
tenebræ
by
the
slow
chanting
of
the
lamentations
and
the
psalms
but
when
he
thought
it
over
that
which
above
all
made
him
shudder
was
the
thought
of
the
virgin
coming
on
the
scene
on
the
thursday
at
nightfall
the
church
till
then
absorbed
in
her
sorrow
and
prostrate
before
the
cross
raised
herself
and
fell
on
beholding
the
mother
by
all
the
voices
of
the
choir
it
pressed
round
mary
endeavouring
to
console
her
mixing
the
tears
of
the
stabat
mater
with
her
own
sighing
out
that
music
of
plaintive
weeping
pressing
the
wound
of
that
sequence
which
gave
forth
water
and
blood
like
the
wound
of
christ
himself
durtal
left
the
church
worn
out
with
these
long
services
but
his
temptations
to
unbelief
were
gone
he
had
no
further
doubt
it
seemed
to
him
that
at
sulpice
grace
mixed
with
the
eloquent
splendours
of
the
liturgies
and
that
in
the
dim
sorrow
of
the
voices
there
had
been
appeals
to
him
and
he
therefore
felt
filial
gratitude
to
that
church
where
he
had
lived
through
hours
so
sweet
and
sad
yet
in
ordinary
weeks
he
did
not
go
there
it
seemed
to
him
too
great
and
too
cold
and
it
was
so
ugly
he
preferred
warmer
and
smaller
sanctuaries
in
which
there
were
still
traces
of
the
middle
ages
thus
on
idle
days
when
he
came
out
of
the
louvre
where
he
had
strayed
for
a
long
time
before
the
canvases
of
the
early
painters
he
was
wont
to
take
refuge
in
the
old
church
of
severin
hidden
away
in
a
corner
of
the
poorer
part
of
paris
he
carried
with
him
the
visions
of
the
canvases
he
had
admired
at
the
louvre
and
contemplated
them
again
in
this
surrounding
where
they
were
thoroughly
at
home
then
he
spent
delightful
moments
in
which
he
was
carried
away
in
the
clouds
of
harmony
divided
by
the
white
splendour
of
a
child
voice
flashing
out
from
the
rolling
thunder
of
the
organ
there
without
even
praying
he
felt
a
plaintive
languor
a
vague
uneasiness
steal
over
him
severin
delighted
him
aided
him
more
than
other
churches
on
some
days
to
gain
an
indescribable
impression
of
joy
and
pity
sometimes
even
when
he
thought
of
the
filth
of
his
senses
to
weave
together
the
regret
and
the
terror
of
his
soul
he
often
went
there
especially
on
sunday
mornings
to
high
mass
at
ten
he
was
wont
to
place
himself
behind
the
high
altar
in
that
melancholy
and
delicate
apse
planted
like
a
winter
garden
with
rare
and
somewhat
fantastic
trees
it
might
have
been
called
a
petrified
arbour
of
very
old
trunks
in
flower
but
stripped
of
leaf
forests
of
pillars
squared
or
cut
in
broad
panels
carved
with
regular
notches
near
the
base
hollowed
through
their
whole
length
like
rhubarb
stalks
channelled
like
celery
no
vegetation
expanded
at
the
summit
of
those
trunks
which
bent
their
naked
boughs
along
the
vaulting
joined
and
met
and
gathered
at
their
junction
and
thin
engrafted
knots
extravagant
bunches
of
heraldic
roses
armorial
flowers
with
open
tracery
and
for
more
than
four
hundred
years
no
sap
had
run
no
bud
had
formed
in
these
trees
the
shafts
bent
for
ever
remained
untouched
the
white
bark
of
these
pillars
was
scarcely
worn
but
the
greater
part
of
the
flowers
were
withered
the
heraldic
petals
were
wanting
some
keystones
of
the
arches
had
only
stratified
calices
open
like
nests
with
holes
like
sponges
in
rags
like
handfuls
of
russet
lace
and
among
this
mystic
flora
amid
these
petrified
trees
there
was
one
strange
and
charming
which
suggested
the
fanciful
idea
that
the
blue
smoke
of
the
rolling
incense
had
condensed
and
as
it
coagulated
had
grown
pale
with
age
to
form
in
twisting
the
spiral
of
a
column
which
was
inverted
on
itself
and
ended
broadening
out
into
a
sheaf
whereof
the
broken
stems
fell
from
above
the
arches
the
corner
where
durtal
took
refuge
was
faintly
lighted
by
pointed
stained
windows
with
black
divisions
set
with
minute
panes
darkened
by
the
accumulated
dust
of
years
rendered
still
more
obscure
by
the
woodwork
of
the
chapels
which
cut
off
half
their
surface
this
apse
might
have
been
called
a
frozen
grove
of
skeleton
trees
a
conservatory
of
dead
specimens
belonging
to
the
palm
family
calling
up
the
memory
of
an
impossible
phoenix
and
unlikely
palms
but
it
also
recalled
by
its
shape
and
doubtful
light
the
image
of
a
ship
prow
below
water
in
fact
it
allowed
to
filter
through
its
bars
to
its
windows
trellised
with
all
black
network
the
murmur
suggested
by
the
rolling
of
the
carriages
which
shook
the
street
of
a
river
which
sifted
the
golden
light
of
day
through
the
briny
course
of
its
waters
on
sundays
at
the
time
of
high
mass
the
apse
was
empty
the
public
filled
the
nave
before
the
high
altar
or
spread
themselves
somewhat
further
into
a
chapel
dedicated
to
our
lady
durtal
was
therefore
almost
alone
and
even
the
people
who
crossed
his
refuge
were
neither
stupid
nor
hostile
like
the
faithful
in
other
churches
in
this
district
were
beggars
the
very
poor
hucksters
sisters
of
charity
rag
pickers
street
arabs
above
all
there
were
women
in
tatters
walking
on
tiptoe
who
knelt
without
looking
round
poor
creatures
overwhelmed
by
the
piteous
splendour
of
the
altars
looking
out
of
the
corner
of
their
eyes
and
bending
low
when
the
suisse
passed
them
touched
by
the
timidity
of
this
silent
misery
durtal
listened
to
the
mass
chanted
by
a
scanty
choir
but
one
patiently
taught
the
choir
of
severin
intoned
the
credo
that
marvel
of
plain
chant
better
than
it
was
done
at
sulpice
where
however
the
offices
were
as
a
rule
solemn
and
correct
it
bore
it
as
it
were
to
the
top
of
the
choir
and
let
it
spread
with
its
great
wings
open
and
almost
without
motion
above
the
prostrate
flock
when
the
verse
et
homo
factus
est
took
its
slow
and
reverent
flight
in
the
low
voice
of
the
singer
it
was
at
once
monumental
and
fluid
indestructible
like
the
articles
of
the
creed
itself
inspired
like
the
text
which
the
holy
spirit
dictated
in
their
last
meeting
to
the
united
apostles
of
christ
at
severin
a
powerful
voice
declaimed
a
verse
as
a
solo
then
all
the
children
sustained
by
the
rest
of
the
singers
delivered
the
others
and
the
unchangeable
truths
declared
themselves
in
their
order
more
attentive
more
grave
more
accentuated
even
a
little
plaintive
in
the
solo
voice
of
a
man
more
timid
perhaps
but
also
more
familiar
and
more
joyous
in
the
dash
however
restrained
of
the
boys
at
such
a
moment
durtal
was
roused
and
exclaimed
within
himself
it
is
impossible
that
the
alluvial
deposits
of
faith
which
have
created
this
musical
certainty
are
false
the
accent
of
these
declarations
is
such
as
to
be
superhuman
and
far
from
profane
music
which
has
never
attained
to
the
solid
grandeur
of
this
naked
chant
the
whole
mass
moreover
at
severin
was
perfect
the
kyrie
eleison
solemn
and
sumptuous
the
gloria
in
excelsis
shared
by
the
grand
and
the
choir
organs
the
one
taking
the
solos
the
other
guiding
and
sustaining
the
singers
was
full
of
exultant
joy
the
sanctus
concentrated
almost
haggard
resounded
through
the
arches
when
the
choir
shouted
the
hosanna
in
excelsis
and
the
agnus
dei
was
sung
low
to
a
clear
suppliant
melody
so
humble
that
it
dared
not
become
loud
indeed
except
for
a
contraband
o
salutaris
introduced
there
as
in
other
churches
severin
maintained
on
ordinary
sundays
the
musical
liturgy
sang
it
almost
reverentially
with
the
fragile
but
voices
of
the
boys
the
solidly
built
basses
bringing
vigorous
sounds
from
the
deep
it
was
a
joy
to
durtal
to
linger
in
the
delightful
surroundings
of
the
middle
ages
in
that
shadowy
loneliness
amid
the
chants
which
rose
behind
him
without
being
annoyed
by
tricks
of
the
mouths
which
he
could
not
see
he
ended
by
being
moved
to
the
very
marrow
choked
by
nervous
tears
and
all
the
bitterness
of
his
life
came
up
before
him
full
of
vague
fears
of
confused
prayers
which
stifled
him
and
found
no
words
he
cursed
the
ignominy
of
his
life
and
swore
to
master
his
carnal
affections
when
the
mass
was
over
he
wandered
in
the
church
itself
and
was
delighted
with
the
spring
of
the
nave
which
four
centuries
built
and
sealed
with
their
arms
placing
on
it
those
strange
impressions
those
wonderful
seals
which
expand
in
relief
under
the
reversed
groining
of
the
arches
these
centuries
combined
to
bring
to
the
feet
of
christ
the
superhuman
effort
of
their
art
and
the
gifts
of
each
are
still
visible
the
thirteenth
century
shaped
those
low
and
stunted
pillars
whose
capitals
are
crowned
with
foliage
with
large
leaves
voluted
with
crochets
and
turned
in
the
form
of
a
crosier
the
fourteenth
century
raised
the
columns
of
the
neighbouring
bays
on
the
sides
of
which
prophets
monks
and
saints
uphold
the
spring
of
the
arches
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
created
the
apse
the
sanctuary
some
windows
pierced
above
the
choir
and
though
they
have
been
restored
by
incompetent
builders
they
have
still
retained
a
barbaric
grace
and
a
really
touching
simplicity
they
seem
to
have
been
designed
by
ancestors
of
the
epinal
foundries
and
stained
by
them
with
crude
colours
the
donors
and
the
saints
who
pass
through
these
bright
pictures
are
all
awkward
and
pensive
dressed
in
robes
of
gamboge
and
wine
lees
and
these
are
made
still
deeper
by
contact
with
the
flesh
tints
either
omitted
or
destroyed
which
have
at
any
rate
remained
uncoloured
like
a
thin
skin
of
glass
in
one
of
these
windows
christ
on
his
cross
seems
limpid
all
in
light
between
blue
splashes
of
sky
and
the
red
and
green
patches
formed
by
the
wings
of
the
two
angels
whose
faces
also
seem
cut
in
crystal
and
full
of
light
these
windows
differ
from
those
of
other
churches
in
that
they
absorb
the
rays
of
the
sun
without
refracting
them
no
doubt
they
have
been
deliberately
divested
of
reflection
that
they
may
not
by
the
insolent
joyousness
of
stones
on
fire
insult
the
melancholy
sorrow
of
this
church
which
rises
in
the
squalid
haunts
of
a
quarter
inhabited
by
beggars
and
thieves
then
these
thoughts
assailed
durtal
in
paris
the
modern
churches
are
useless
they
remain
deaf
to
the
prayers
which
break
against
the
icy
indifference
of
their
walls
no
man
recollects
himself
in
those
naves
where
souls
have
left
nothing
of
themselves
or
where
they
have
perhaps
given
themselves
away
have
had
to
turn
and
fall
back
on
themselves
rebuffed
by
the
insolence
of
a
photographic
glare
darkened
by
the
neglect
of
those
altars
at
which
no
saint
has
ever
said
mass
it
seemed
that
god
had
always
gone
out
and
would
only
come
home
to
keep
his
promise
to
appear
at
the
moment
of
consecration
and
that
he
would
retire
immediately
afterwards
despising
these
edifices
which
have
not
been
built
expressly
for
him
since
by
the
baseness
of
their
form
they
might
be
put
to
any
profane
use
since
above
all
they
do
not
bring
him
in
default
of
sanctity
the
only
gift
which
might
please
him
the
gift
of
art
which
he
has
lent
to
man
and
which
allows
him
to
see
himself
in
the
abridged
restitution
of
his
work
and
to
rejoice
in
the
development
of
that
flower
of
which
he
has
sowed
the
seed
in
souls
which
he
has
carefully
chosen
in
souls
which
are
truly
the
elect
second
only
to
those
of
his
saints
ah
those
charitable
churches
of
the
middle
ages
those
chapels
damp
and
smoky
full
of
ancient
song
of
exquisite
paintings
of
the
odour
of
extinguished
tapers
of
the
perfume
of
burning
incense
in
paris
there
remain
now
only
a
few
specimens
of
this
art
of
other
years
a
few
sanctuaries
whose
stones
really
exude
the
faith
among
these
severin
seemed
to
durtal
the
most
exquisite
and
the
most
certain
he
only
felt
at
home
there
he
believed
that
if
he
could
ever
pray
in
earnest
he
could
do
it
in
that
church
and
he
said
to
himself
that
there
lived
the
spirit
of
the
fabric
it
is
impossible
but
that
the
burning
prayers
the
hopeless
sobs
of
the
middle
ages
have
not
for
ever
impregnated
the
pillars
and
stained
the
walls
it
is
impossible
but
that
the
vine
of
sorrows
whence
of
old
the
saints
gathered
warm
clusters
of
tears
has
not
preserved
from
those
wonderful
times
emanations
which
sustain
a
breath
which
still
awakes
a
shame
for
sin
and
the
gift
of
tears
as
saint
agnes
remained
immaculate
in
the
brothels
this
church
remained
intact
amid
infamous
surroundings
when
all
near
it
in
the
streets
from
the
château
rouge
to
the
cremerie
alexandre
only
two
paces
off
the
modern
rabble
of
rascality
combine
their
misdeeds
mingling
with
prostitutes
their
brewage
of
crime
their
adulterated
absinthe
and
spirits
in
this
especial
territory
of
satanism
the
church
rises
delicate
and
little
closely
enveloped
in
the
rags
of
taverns
and
hovels
and
seen
far
off
raises
above
the
roofs
its
light
spire
like
a
netting
needle
its
point
below
and
lifting
its
eye
into
the
light
and
air
through
which
can
be
seen
a
minute
bell
surmounting
a
sort
of
anvil
such
it
appears
at
least
from
the
place
saint
andré
des
arts
symbolically
it
might
be
called
a
piteous
appeal
always
rejected
by
souls
hardened
and
hammered
by
vice
of
that
anvil
which
was
only
an
optical
illusion
and
that
very
real
bell
they
say
thought
durtal
they
say
that
ignorant
architects
and
unskilled
archæologists
wish
to
free
severin
from
its
rags
and
surround
it
with
trees
in
an
enclosed
square
but
it
has
always
lived
in
its
network
of
black
streets
and
is
voluntarily
humble
in
accordance
with
the
miserable
district
it
aids
in
the
middle
ages
the
church
was
a
monument
seen
only
within
and
not
one
of
those
impetuous
basilicas
which
are
put
up
as
a
show
in
open
spaces
then
it
was
an
oratory
for
the
poor
a
church
on
its
knees
and
not
standing
it
would
therefore
be
the
most
absolute
nonsense
to
free
it
from
its
surroundings
to
take
it
out
of
the
day
of
an
eternal
twilight
out
of
those
hours
of
shadow
which
brighten
the
melancholy
beauty
of
a
servant
in
prayer
behind
the
impious
hedge
of
hovels
ah
were
it
possible
to
steep
the
church
in
the
glowing
atmosphere
of
notre
dame
des
victoires
and
join
to
its
meagre
psalmody
the
powerful
choir
of
sulpice
that
would
be
complete
said
durtal
but
alas
here
below
nothing
whole
nothing
perfect
exists
indeed
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
it
was
the
only
church
which
satisfied
him
for
notre
dame
de
paris
was
too
grand
and
too
much
overrun
by
tourists
there
were
few
ceremonies
there
just
the
necessary
amount
of
prayers
were
weighed
out
and
the
greater
part
of
the
chapels
remained
closed
and
lastly
the
voices
of
the
choir
boys
always
wanted
mending
they
broke
while
the
advanced
age
of
the
basses
made
them
hoarse
at
etienne
du
mont
it
was
worse
still
the
shell
of
the
church
was
charming
but
the
choir
was
an
offshoot
of
the
school
of
sanfourche
you
might
think
yourself
in
a
kennel
where
a
medley
pack
of
sick
beasts
were
growling
as
for
the
other
sanctuaries
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
they
were
worthless
plain
chant
was
as
far
as
possible
suppressed
and
the
poverty
of
the
voices
was
everywhere
ornamented
with
promiscuous
tunes
yet
on
the
right
bank
were
the
more
churches
for
religious
paris
stops
on
that
side
of
the
seine
and
comes
to
an
end
as
you
pass
the
bridges
in
fact
to
sum
up
all
he
might
believe
that
severin
by
its
scent
and
the
delightful
art
of
its
old
nave
sulpice
by
its
ceremonies
and
its
chanting
had
brought
him
back
towards
christian
art
which
in
its
turn
had
directed
him
to
god
then
when
once
urged
on
this
way
he
had
pursued
it
had
left
architecture
and
music
to
wander
in
the
mystic
territories
of
the
other
arts
and
his
long
visits
to
the
louvre
his
researches
into
the
breviaries
into
the
books
of
ruysbröck
angela
da
foligno
saint
teresa
saint
catherine
of
genoa
saint
magdalen
of
pazzi
had
confirmed
him
in
his
belief
but
the
upheaval
of
all
his
ideas
which
he
had
undergone
was
too
recent
for
his
soul
at
once
to
regain
its
equilibrium
from
time
to
time
it
seemed
to
wish
to
go
back
and
he
discussed
with
himself
in
order
to
set
it
at
rest
he
spent
himself
in
disputation
came
to
doubt
the
reality
of
his
conversion
and
said
after
all
i
am
united
to
the
church
only
on
the
side
of
art
i
only
go
there
to
see
or
hear
and
not
to
pray
i
do
not
seek
the
lord
but
my
own
pleasure
this
is
not
business
just
as
in
a
warm
bath
i
do
not
feel
the
cold
if
i
am
motionless
but
if
i
move
i
freeze
so
in
the
church
my
impulses
are
upset
when
i
move
i
am
almost
on
fire
in
the
nave
less
warm
in
the
porch
and
i
become
perfectly
icy
outside
these
are
literary
postulates
vibrations
of
the
nerves
skirmishes
of
thought
spiritual
brawls
whatever
you
please
except
faith
but
what
disquieted
him
still
more
than
the
need
of
helps
to
feeling
was
that
his
shameless
senses
rebelled
at
the
contact
of
religious
ideas
he
floated
like
wreckage
between
licentiousness
and
the
church
they
each
threw
him
back
in
turn
obliging
him
as
he
approached
one
to
return
at
once
to
that
which
he
had
left
and
he
was
inclined
to
ask
if
he
were
not
a
victim
to
some
mystification
of
his
lower
instincts
seeking
to
revive
themselves
without
his
consciousness
by
the
cordial
of
a
false
piety
in
fact
he
had
often
seen
realized
in
himself
that
unclean
miracle
when
he
had
left
severin
almost
in
tears
insensibly
without
connection
of
ideas
without
any
welding
together
of
sensations
without
the
explosion
of
a
spark
his
senses
took
fire
and
he
was
powerless
to
let
them
burn
themselves
out
to
resist
them
he
loathed
himself
afterwards
and
it
was
high
time
then
came
the
reverse
movement
he
longed
to
run
to
some
chapel
there
to
wash
and
be
clean
and
he
was
so
disgusted
with
himself
that
now
and
then
he
went
as
far
as
the
door
and
dared
not
enter
at
other
times
on
the
contrary
he
rebelled
against
himself
and
cried
in
fury
it
is
monstrous
i
have
in
fact
spoiled
for
myself
the
only
pleasure
that
remained
to
me
the
flesh
once
i
amused
myself
without
blame
now
i
pay
for
my
poor
debauches
with
torments
i
have
added
one
more
weariness
to
existence
would
that
i
could
undo
it
he
lied
to
himself
in
vain
trying
to
justify
himself
by
suggesting
doubts
suppose
all
this
were
not
true
if
there
were
nothing
in
it
if
i
were
deceiving
myself
what
if
the
freethinkers
were
right
but
he
was
obliged
to
be
sorry
for
himself
for
he
felt
distinctly
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
that
he
held
unshaken
the
certitude
of
true
faith
these
discussions
are
miserable
and
the
excuses
i
make
for
my
filthinesses
are
odious
he
said
to
himself
and
a
flame
of
enthusiasm
sprang
up
within
him
how
doubt
the
truth
of
dogmas
how
deny
the
divine
power
of
the
church
for
she
commands
assent
first
she
has
her
superhuman
art
and
her
mysticism
then
she
is
most
wonderful
in
the
persistent
folly
of
conquered
heresies
all
since
the
world
began
have
had
the
flesh
as
their
logically
and
humanly
speaking
they
should
have
triumphed
for
they
allowed
man
and
woman
to
satisfy
their
passions
saying
to
themselves
there
was
no
sin
in
these
even
sanctifying
them
as
the
gnostics
rendering
homage
to
god
by
the
foulest
uncleanness
all
have
suffered
shipwreck
the
church
unbending
in
this
matter
has
remained
upright
and
entire
she
orders
the
body
to
be
silent
and
the
soul
to
suffer
and
contrary
to
all
probability
humanity
listens
to
her
and
sweeps
away
like
a
the
seductive
joys
proposed
to
her
again
the
vitality
of
the
church
is
decision
which
preserves
her
in
spite
of
the
unfathomable
stupidity
of
her
sons
she
has
resisted
the
disquieting
folly
of
the
clergy
and
has
not
even
been
broken
up
by
the
awkwardness
and
lack
of
ability
in
her
defenders
a
very
strong
point
no
the
more
i
think
of
her
he
cried
the
more
i
think
her
prodigious
unique
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
she
alone
holds
the
truth
that
outside
her
are
only
weaknesses
of
mind
impostures
scandals
the
church
is
the
divine
breeding
ground
the
heavenly
dispensary
of
souls
she
gives
them
suck
nourishes
them
and
heals
them
she
bids
them
understand
when
the
hour
of
sorrow
comes
that
true
life
begins
not
at
birth
but
at
death
the
church
is
indefectible
before
all
things
admirable
she
is
great
yes
but
then
we
must
follow
her
directions
and
practise
the
sacraments
she
orders
and
durtal
shaking
his
head
gave
himself
no
further
answer
chapter
iii
before
his
conversion
he
had
said
like
all
unbelievers
if
i
believed
that
jesus
christ
is
god
and
that
eternal
life
is
not
a
decoy
i
would
not
hesitate
to
change
all
my
habits
to
follow
as
far
as
possible
the
rules
of
religion
and
in
any
case
to
live
chaste
and
he
was
surprised
that
people
he
knew
who
were
in
these
conditions
did
not
maintain
an
attitude
higher
than
his
own
he
who
had
so
long
indulgently
forgiven
himself
became
singularly
intolerant
so
soon
as
he
had
to
do
with
a
catholic
he
now
understood
the
injustice
of
his
judgments
and
confessed
that
between
faith
and
practice
was
a
gulf
difficult
to
overpass
he
did
not
like
to
discuss
this
question
with
himself
but
it
returned
and
took
possession
of
him
all
the
same
and
he
was
obliged
to
admit
the
meanness
of
his
arguments
the
despicable
reasons
for
his
resistance
he
was
still
honest
enough
to
say
i
am
no
longer
a
child
if
i
have
faith
if
i
admit
catholicism
i
can
not
conceive
it
as
lukewarm
and
unfixed
warmed
up
again
and
again
in
the
saucepan
of
a
false
zeal
i
will
have
no
compromise
or
truce
no
alternations
of
debauch
and
communions
no
stages
of
licentiousness
and
piety
no
all
or
nothing
to
change
from
top
to
bottom
or
not
change
at
all
then
he
drew
back
in
alarm
endeavoured
to
escape
the
part
he
was
about
to
take
endeavoured
to
exculpate
himself
cavilling
for
hours
invoking
the
most
wretched
motives
for
remaining
as
he
was
and
not
budging
a
jot
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
do
not
obey
orders
which
i
feel
with
increasing
force
i
am
preparing
for
myself
a
life
of
uneasiness
and
remorse
for
i
know
well
i
ought
not
to
remain
for
ever
on
the
threshold
but
to
penetrate
into
the
sanctuary
and
stay
there
and
if
i
make
up
my
mind
no
indeed
for
then
i
must
bind
myself
to
a
heap
of
observances
bend
to
a
series
of
rules
assist
at
mass
on
sunday
abstain
on
friday
live
like
a
bigot
and
look
like
a
fool
and
then
to
help
his
revolt
he
thought
of
the
air
the
look
of
people
who
frequented
the
churches
for
two
men
who
looked
intelligent
and
clean
how
many
were
without
doubt
rascals
and
impostors
almost
all
had
a
look
an
oily
voice
downcast
eyes
immovable
spectacles
clothes
like
sacristans
as
if
of
black
wood
almost
all
told
thin
beads
ostentatiously
and
with
more
strategy
and
more
knavery
than
the
wicked
took
toll
from
their
neighbours
on
leaving
god
the
devout
women
were
still
less
reassuring
they
invaded
the
church
walking
about
as
if
quite
at
home
disturbing
everybody
upsetting
chairs
knocking
against
you
without
begging
pardon
then
they
knelt
down
with
much
ado
in
the
attitude
of
contrite
angels
murmured
interminable
paternosters
and
left
the
church
more
arrogant
and
sour
than
before
it
is
not
encouraging
to
have
to
mix
with
this
flock
of
pious
geese
he
exclaimed
but
soon
against
his
will
he
made
answer
to
himself
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
others
were
you
more
humble
these
people
would
certainly
seem
less
offensive
at
any
rate
they
have
the
courage
you
lack
they
are
not
ashamed
of
their
faith
and
are
not
afraid
to
kneel
to
god
in
public
and
durtal
remained
dumfounded
for
he
had
to
admit
that
the
riposte
struck
home
it
was
clear
his
humility
was
at
fault
but
what
was
worse
he
could
not
free
himself
from
human
respect
he
was
afraid
of
being
taken
for
a
fool
the
prospect
of
being
seen
on
his
knees
in
church
made
his
hair
stand
on
end
the
idea
that
if
he
ever
had
to
communicate
he
would
have
to
rise
and
go
to
the
altar
in
the
sight
of
all
was
intolerable
to
him
if
that
moment
ever
come
it
will
be
hard
to
bear
said
he
and
yet
i
am
an
idiot
for
what
have
i
to
do
with
the
opinion
of
people
i
do
not
know
but
much
as
he
might
repeat
that
his
alarms
were
absurd
he
could
not
get
over
them
or
free
himself
from
the
fear
of
ridicule
after
all
he
said
even
if
i
decide
to
jump
the
ditch
to
confess
and
communicate
that
terrible
question
of
the
senses
would
always
have
to
be
resolved
i
must
determine
to
fly
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
and
accept
perpetual
abstinence
i
could
never
attain
to
that
without
counting
that
in
any
case
the
time
would
be
were
i
now
to
make
such
an
effort
for
never
have
i
been
so
tormented
as
since
my
conversion
catholicism
unfortunately
excites
unclean
suggestions
when
i
prowl
about
it
without
entering
and
to
this
exclamation
another
answered
at
once
yes
but
you
must
enter
he
was
irritated
at
this
change
of
front
without
change
of
place
and
he
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
as
though
it
had
been
held
with
another
whose
questions
perplexed
him
but
he
came
back
to
it
all
the
same
and
in
his
annoyance
summoned
all
his
reasoning
powers
to
his
aid
come
let
us
try
to
take
stock
at
any
rate
it
is
plain
that
as
i
have
drawn
near
the
church
my
unclean
desires
have
become
more
frequent
and
more
persistent
and
yet
another
fact
is
certain
that
i
have
been
so
used
up
by
twenty
years
of
debauchery
that
i
ought
not
to
have
any
further
carnal
appetites
in
fact
if
i
chose
it
i
could
perfectly
well
remain
chaste
but
then
i
must
bid
my
miserable
brain
be
silent
and
i
have
no
power
to
do
so
it
is
frightful
all
the
same
that
i
am
more
excited
than
in
youth
for
now
my
desires
go
and
since
they
have
not
their
ordinary
shelter
they
go
off
in
search
of
evil
haunts
how
may
this
be
explained
it
is
a
sort
of
dyspepsia
of
the
soul
which
can
not
digest
ordinary
meats
and
tries
to
feed
on
spiced
dreams
highly
seasoned
thoughts
it
is
then
want
of
appetite
for
wholesome
meals
which
has
begotten
this
greediness
for
strange
dishes
this
trouble
of
the
mind
this
wish
to
escape
from
myself
and
jump
were
it
but
for
a
moment
over
the
permitted
limits
of
the
senses
in
that
case
catholicism
would
play
a
part
at
once
repellent
and
depressing
it
would
stimulate
these
sick
desires
and
weaken
me
at
the
same
time
would
give
me
over
to
nervous
emotions
without
strength
to
resist
them
wandering
thus
in
he
came
to
a
dead
stand
where
was
no
issue
arriving
at
this
conclusion
i
do
not
practise
my
religion
because
i
yield
to
my
baser
instincts
and
i
yield
to
these
instincts
because
i
do
not
practise
my
religion
brought
up
thus
by
a
dead
wall
he
resisted
asking
if
this
last
observation
were
indeed
true
for
after
all
nothing
proved
that
if
he
approached
the
sacraments
he
would
not
be
attacked
with
even
greater
violence
it
was
even
probable
he
would
be
for
the
devil
makes
a
dead
set
at
pious
people
then
he
rebelled
against
the
cowardice
of
these
remarks
and
cried
i
lie
for
i
know
well
that
if
i
made
the
least
sign
of
resistance
i
should
be
powerfully
aided
from
on
high
clever
at
he
continued
to
harass
his
soul
always
on
the
same
line
suppose
he
said
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
i
have
tamed
my
pride
and
subdued
my
body
suppose
that
at
present
there
were
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
forward
i
am
still
brought
up
for
the
final
obstacle
terrifies
me
up
to
now
i
have
been
able
to
walk
alone
without
earthly
assistance
without
advice
i
have
been
converted
without
the
help
of
anyone
but
now
i
can
not
make
a
step
without
a
guide
i
can
not
approach
the
altar
without
the
aid
of
an
interpreter
and
the
bulwark
of
a
priest
and
once
more
he
drew
back
for
in
former
times
he
had
been
intimate
with
a
certain
number
of
ecclesiastics
and
had
found
them
so
mediocre
so
lukewarm
above
all
so
hostile
to
mysticism
that
he
was
revolted
at
the
very
notion
of
laying
before
them
the
schedule
of
his
requirements
and
his
regrets
they
will
not
understand
me
he
thought
they
will
answer
that
mysticism
was
interesting
in
the
middle
ages
but
has
now
become
disused
and
is
in
any
case
quite
out
of
touch
with
the
modern
spirit
they
will
think
me
mad
will
assure
me
moreover
that
god
does
not
want
so
much
will
advise
me
with
a
smile
not
to
make
myself
singular
to
do
as
others
and
to
think
like
them
i
have
indeed
no
intention
of
entering
on
the
way
of
mysticism
but
they
may
at
least
allow
me
to
envy
it
and
not
inflict
on
me
their
ideal
of
a
god
for
not
to
deceive
oneself
catholicism
is
not
only
that
moderate
religion
that
they
offer
us
it
is
not
composed
only
of
petty
cases
and
formulas
it
is
not
wholly
confined
to
rigid
observances
and
the
toys
of
old
maids
to
all
that
business
which
spreads
itself
abroad
in
the
rue
saint
sulpice
it
is
far
more
exalted
far
purer
but
then
we
must
penetrate
its
burning
zone
and
seek
in
mysticism
the
art
the
essence
and
the
very
soul
of
the
church
using
the
powerful
means
at
her
disposal
we
then
have
to
empty
ourselves
and
strip
the
soul
so
that
christ
if
he
will
may
enter
it
we
have
to
purify
the
house
to
cleanse
it
with
the
disinfectant
of
prayer
and
the
sublimate
of
sacraments
in
a
word
to
be
ready
when
the
guest
shall
come
and
bid
us
to
empty
ourselves
wholly
into
him
as
he
will
pour
himself
into
us
i
know
thoroughly
well
that
this
divine
alchemy
this
transmutation
of
the
human
creature
into
god
is
generally
impossible
for
the
saviour
as
a
rule
keeps
his
singular
favours
for
his
elect
but
after
all
every
one
however
unworthy
is
presumably
able
to
attain
that
majestic
end
since
god
only
decides
and
not
man
whose
humble
acquiescence
alone
is
requisite
i
see
myself
saying
that
to
the
priests
they
will
tell
me
i
have
no
business
with
mystical
ideas
and
will
give
me
in
exchange
the
petty
religion
of
rich
women
they
will
wish
to
mix
themselves
up
with
my
life
to
inquire
about
the
state
of
my
soul
to
insinuate
their
own
tastes
they
will
try
to
convince
me
that
art
is
dangerous
will
sermonize
me
with
imbecile
talk
and
pour
over
me
their
flowing
bowls
of
pious
veal
broth
i
know
what
i
am
at
the
end
of
a
couple
of
interviews
i
shall
rebel
and
become
wicked
durtal
shook
his
head
remained
in
thought
and
began
again
yet
one
must
be
just
perhaps
the
secular
clergy
are
only
the
leavings
for
the
contemplative
orders
and
the
missionary
army
carry
away
every
year
the
pick
of
the
spiritual
basket
the
mystics
priests
athirst
for
sorrows
drunk
with
sacrifice
bury
themselves
in
cloisters
or
exile
themselves
among
savages
whom
they
teach
so
when
the
cream
is
off
the
rest
of
the
clergy
are
plainly
but
skim
milk
the
scourings
of
the
seminaries
yes
but
after
all
he
continued
the
question
is
not
whether
they
are
intelligent
or
narrow
it
is
not
my
business
to
take
the
priest
to
pieces
to
discover
under
the
consecrated
rind
the
nothingness
of
the
man
not
my
business
to
abuse
his
inadequacy
since
it
is
thoroughly
suited
to
the
understanding
of
the
crowd
would
it
not
be
after
all
more
courageous
and
more
humble
to
kneel
before
a
being
of
whose
brains
you
know
the
weakness
and
then
then
i
am
not
reduced
to
that
for
indeed
i
know
one
in
paris
a
true
mystic
suppose
i
go
and
see
him
and
he
thought
of
a
certain
abbé
gévresin
with
whom
he
had
formerly
some
acquaintance
he
had
often
met
him
at
a
bookseller
in
the
rue
servandoni
old
tocane
who
had
rare
books
on
liturgy
and
the
lives
of
the
saints
learning
that
durtal
was
looking
for
works
on
blessed
lidwine
the
priest
was
at
once
interested
in
him
and
on
leaving
the
shop
they
had
a
long
conversation
the
abbé
was
very
old
and
walked
with
difficulty
therefore
he
willingly
took
durtal
arm
who
saw
him
home
the
life
of
that
victim
of
the
sins
of
her
time
is
a
magnificent
subject
he
said
you
remember
it
do
you
not
and
as
they
walked
he
sketched
its
lines
broadly
lidwine
was
born
towards
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
at
schiedam
in
holland
her
beauty
was
extraordinary
but
she
lost
it
through
illness
at
the
age
of
fifteen
she
recovered
but
while
skating
one
day
with
her
companions
on
the
frozen
canals
she
fell
and
broke
a
rib
from
the
time
of
that
accident
to
her
death
she
was
she
was
afflicted
with
most
frightful
ailments
her
wounds
festered
and
worms
bred
in
her
putrefying
flesh
erysipelas
that
terrible
malady
of
the
middle
ages
consumed
her
her
right
arm
was
eaten
away
a
single
muscle
held
it
to
the
body
her
brow
was
cleft
in
two
one
of
her
eyes
became
blind
and
the
other
so
weak
that
it
could
not
bear
the
light
while
she
was
in
this
condition
the
plague
ravaged
holland
and
decimated
the
town
in
which
she
lived
she
was
the
first
attacked
two
boils
formed
one
under
her
arm
the
other
above
the
heart
boils
it
is
well
she
said
to
the
lord
three
would
be
better
in
honour
of
the
holy
trinity
and
immediately
a
third
pustule
broke
out
on
her
face
for
years
she
lived
in
a
cellar
taking
no
solid
food
praying
and
weeping
so
chilly
in
winter
that
each
morning
her
tears
formed
two
frozen
streams
down
her
cheeks
she
thought
herself
still
too
fortunate
and
entreated
the
lord
not
to
spare
her
and
obtained
from
him
the
grace
that
by
her
sufferings
she
might
expiate
the
sins
of
others
christ
heard
her
prayers
visited
her
with
his
angels
communicated
her
with
his
own
hand
gave
her
the
delight
of
heavenly
ecstasies
and
caused
her
festering
wounds
to
exhale
delicious
perfumes
at
the
moment
of
her
death
he
stood
by
her
and
restored
her
poor
body
to
its
former
soundness
her
beauty
so
long
vanished
shone
out
again
the
town
was
moved
the
sick
came
in
crowds
and
all
who
drew
near
were
healed
she
is
the
true
patroness
of
the
sick
concluded
the
abbé
and
after
a
silence
he
added
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
higher
mysticism
lidwine
is
wonderful
for
in
her
we
can
verify
that
plan
of
substitution
which
was
and
is
the
glorious
reason
for
the
existence
of
convents
and
as
without
answering
durtal
questioned
him
with
a
look
he
went
on
you
are
aware
sir
that
in
all
ages
nuns
have
offered
themselves
to
heaven
as
expiatory
victims
the
lives
of
saints
both
men
and
women
who
desired
these
sacrifices
abound
of
those
who
atoned
for
the
sins
of
others
by
sufferings
eagerly
demanded
and
patiently
borne
but
there
is
a
task
still
more
arduous
and
more
painful
than
was
desired
by
these
admirable
souls
it
is
not
now
that
of
purging
the
faults
of
others
but
of
preventing
them
hindering
their
commission
by
taking
the
place
of
those
who
are
too
weak
to
bear
the
shock
read
saint
teresa
on
this
subject
you
will
see
that
she
gained
permission
to
take
on
herself
and
without
flinching
the
temptations
of
a
priest
who
could
not
endure
them
this
substitution
of
a
strong
soul
freeing
one
who
is
not
strong
from
perils
and
fears
is
one
of
the
great
rules
of
mysticism
sometimes
this
exchange
is
purely
spiritual
sometimes
on
the
contrary
it
has
to
do
only
with
the
ills
of
the
body
saint
teresa
was
the
surrogate
of
souls
in
torment
sister
catherine
emmerich
took
the
place
of
the
sick
relieved
at
least
those
who
were
most
suffering
thus
for
instance
she
was
able
to
undergo
the
agony
of
a
woman
suffering
from
consumption
and
dropsy
in
order
to
permit
her
to
prepare
for
death
in
peace
well
lidwine
took
on
herself
all
bodily
ills
she
lusted
for
physical
suffering
and
was
greedy
for
wounds
she
was
as
it
were
the
reaper
of
punishments
and
she
was
also
the
piteous
vessel
in
which
everyone
discharged
the
overflowings
of
his
malady
if
you
would
speak
of
her
in
other
fashion
than
the
poor
hagiographies
of
our
day
study
first
that
law
of
substitution
that
miracle
of
perfect
charity
that
superhuman
triumph
of
mysticism
that
will
be
the
stem
of
your
book
and
naturally
without
effort
all
lidwine
acts
graft
themselves
on
it
but
asked
durtal
does
this
law
still
take
effect
yes
i
know
convents
which
apply
it
moreover
orders
like
the
carmelites
and
the
poor
clares
willingly
accept
the
transfer
to
them
of
temptations
we
suffer
then
these
convents
take
on
their
backs
so
to
speak
the
diabolical
expiations
of
those
insolvent
souls
whose
debts
they
pay
to
the
full
all
the
same
said
durtal
shaking
his
head
if
you
consent
to
take
on
yourself
the
assaults
intended
for
your
neighbour
you
must
make
pretty
sure
not
to
sink
the
nuns
chosen
by
our
lord
replied
the
abbé
as
victims
of
expiation
as
whole
are
in
fact
few
and
they
are
generally
especially
in
this
age
obliged
to
unite
and
coalesce
in
order
to
bear
without
failing
the
weight
of
misdeeds
which
try
them
for
in
order
that
a
soul
may
bear
alone
the
assaults
of
satan
which
are
often
terrible
it
must
be
indeed
assisted
by
the
angels
and
elect
of
god
and
after
a
silence
the
old
priest
added
i
believe
i
may
speak
with
some
experience
in
these
matters
for
i
am
one
of
the
directors
of
those
nuns
who
make
reparation
in
their
convents
and
yet
cried
durtal
the
world
asks
what
is
the
good
of
the
contemplative
orders
they
are
the
lightning
conductors
of
society
said
the
abbé
with
great
energy
they
draw
on
themselves
the
demoniacal
fluid
they
absorb
temptations
to
vice
preserve
by
their
prayers
those
who
live
like
ourselves
in
sin
they
appease
in
fact
the
wrath
of
the
most
high
that
he
may
not
place
the
earth
under
an
interdict
ah
while
the
sisters
who
devote
themselves
to
nursing
the
sick
and
infirm
are
indeed
admirable
their
task
is
easy
in
comparison
with
that
undertaken
by
the
cloistered
orders
the
orders
where
penance
never
ceases
and
the
very
nights
spent
in
bed
are
broken
by
sobs
this
priest
is
far
more
interesting
than
his
brethren
said
durtal
to
himself
as
they
parted
and
as
the
abbé
invited
his
visits
he
had
often
called
on
him
he
had
always
been
cordially
welcomed
on
several
occasions
he
had
warily
sounded
the
old
man
on
several
questions
he
had
answered
evasively
in
regard
to
other
priests
but
he
did
not
seem
to
think
much
of
them
if
durtal
might
judge
by
what
he
said
one
day
in
regard
to
lidwine
that
magnet
of
sorrows
notice
he
said
that
a
weak
and
honest
soul
has
every
advantage
in
choosing
a
confessor
not
from
the
clergy
who
have
lost
the
sense
of
mysticism
but
from
the
monks
they
alone
know
the
effects
of
the
law
of
substitution
and
if
they
see
that
in
spite
of
their
efforts
the
penitent
succumbs
they
end
by
freeing
him
by
taking
his
trials
on
themselves
or
by
sending
them
off
to
some
convent
in
the
country
where
resolute
people
can
use
them
another
time
the
question
of
nationalities
was
discussed
in
a
newspaper
which
durtal
showed
him
the
abbé
shrugged
his
shoulders
putting
aside
the
patriotic
twaddle
for
me
he
said
calmly
for
me
my
country
is
that
where
i
can
best
pray
durtal
could
not
make
out
what
this
priest
was
he
understood
from
the
bookseller
that
the
abbé
gévresin
on
account
of
his
great
age
and
infirmity
was
incapacitated
for
the
regular
duties
of
the
priesthood
i
know
that
when
he
can
he
still
says
his
mass
each
morning
in
a
convent
i
believe
also
he
receives
a
few
of
his
brethren
for
confession
in
his
own
house
and
tocane
added
with
disdain
he
has
barely
enough
to
live
on
and
they
do
not
look
on
him
with
favour
at
the
because
of
his
mystical
notions
there
ended
all
he
knew
about
him
he
is
evidently
a
very
good
priest
repeated
durtal
his
physiognomy
declares
it
and
his
mouth
and
eyes
contradict
each
other
his
eyes
certainly
declare
his
entire
goodness
his
lips
somewhat
thick
purple
and
always
moist
have
on
them
an
affectionate
but
somewhat
sad
smile
and
to
this
his
blue
eyes
give
the
lie
blue
childlike
eyes
which
laugh
out
astonished
under
white
eyebrows
in
a
rather
red
face
touched
on
the
cheeks
like
a
ripe
apricot
with
little
points
of
blood
in
any
case
said
durtal
waking
from
his
meditations
i
am
very
wrong
not
to
continue
the
relations
into
which
i
have
entered
with
him
yes
but
then
nothing
is
so
difficult
as
to
become
really
intimate
with
a
priest
first
by
the
very
education
he
receives
at
the
seminary
the
ecclesiastic
thinks
himself
obliged
to
disperse
his
affections
and
not
concentrate
himself
on
particular
friendships
then
like
a
doctor
he
is
a
man
harassed
with
business
who
is
never
to
be
found
you
can
catch
them
now
and
then
between
two
confessions
or
two
sick
calls
nor
even
then
are
you
quite
certain
that
the
eager
welcome
of
the
priest
rings
true
for
he
is
just
the
same
to
all
who
come
to
him
and
indeed
since
i
do
not
call
on
the
abbé
gévresin
for
his
help
or
advice
i
am
afraid
of
being
in
his
way
and
of
taking
up
his
time
hence
i
am
acting
with
discretion
in
not
going
to
see
him
yet
i
am
sorry
suppose
i
write
or
go
to
him
one
morning
but
what
have
i
to
say
to
him
i
ought
to
know
what
i
want
before
i
allow
myself
to
trouble
him
if
i
go
only
to
complain
he
will
answer
i
am
wrong
not
to
be
a
communicant
and
i
have
nothing
to
answer
no
the
better
plan
is
to
meet
him
as
by
chance
on
the
quays
where
no
doubt
he
sometimes
looks
over
the
or
at
tocane
for
then
i
can
talk
to
him
more
intimately
at
least
less
officially
about
my
vacillations
and
regrets
so
durtal
searched
the
quays
and
never
once
met
the
abbé
he
went
to
the
bookseller
and
pretended
to
look
over
his
stock
but
as
soon
as
he
pronounced
the
name
gévresin
tocane
exclaimed
i
have
heard
nothing
of
him
he
has
not
been
here
for
the
last
two
months
i
will
not
turn
back
but
just
disturb
him
in
his
own
house
said
durtal
but
he
will
wonder
why
i
came
back
after
so
long
an
absence
besides
the
awkwardness
i
feel
in
calling
on
people
whom
i
have
neglected
i
am
also
troubled
by
thinking
the
abbé
may
suspect
some
interested
object
in
my
visit
that
is
not
convenient
if
i
had
but
a
good
pretext
there
is
certainly
that
life
of
lidwine
which
interests
him
i
might
consult
him
on
various
points
yes
but
which
i
have
not
concerned
myself
with
that
saint
for
a
long
time
and
must
read
over
again
the
meagre
old
books
on
her
biography
after
all
it
will
be
simpler
and
better
to
be
frank
and
say
is
why
i
have
come
i
want
to
ask
advice
which
i
have
not
determined
to
follow
but
i
have
so
much
need
of
speaking
of
giving
the
reins
to
my
soul
that
i
beg
you
to
be
so
kind
as
to
lose
an
hour
for
my
sake
he
will
do
it
certainly
and
willingly
then
that
is
agreed
on
suppose
i
go
but
he
checked
himself
at
once
there
was
nothing
pressing
there
was
plenty
of
time
better
take
time
and
think
ah
yes
here
is
christmas
close
upon
us
i
can
not
decently
trouble
a
priest
who
has
his
penitents
to
confess
for
there
are
many
communicants
on
that
day
let
him
get
his
hard
work
over
and
then
we
will
see
he
was
at
first
pleased
at
having
invented
that
excuse
then
he
had
to
admit
in
his
heart
that
after
all
there
was
not
much
in
it
for
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
this
priest
who
was
not
attached
to
a
parish
was
busy
in
hearing
confessions
it
was
hardly
probable
but
he
tried
to
convince
himself
that
it
might
be
so
after
all
and
his
hesitation
began
again
angry
at
last
with
the
discussion
he
adopted
a
middle
course
for
greater
certainty
he
would
not
call
on
the
abbé
till
after
christmas
but
he
would
not
be
later
than
a
given
time
he
took
an
almanack
and
swore
to
keep
his
promise
three
days
after
that
feast
chapter
iv
oh
that
midnight
mass
he
had
had
the
unfortunate
idea
of
going
to
it
at
christmas
he
went
to
severin
and
found
a
young
ladies
day
school
installed
there
instead
of
the
choir
who
with
sharp
voices
like
needles
knitted
the
skeins
of
the
canticles
he
had
fled
to
sulpice
and
plunged
into
a
crowd
which
walked
and
talked
as
if
in
the
open
air
had
heard
there
marches
waltzes
firework
tunes
and
had
come
away
in
a
rage
it
had
seemed
to
him
superfluous
to
try
for
he
held
that
church
in
horror
besides
the
weariness
inspired
by
its
heavy
shell
and
the
miserable
paintings
with
which
flandrin
loaded
it
the
clergy
there
were
specially
almost
alarmingly
ugly
and
the
choir
was
truly
infamous
they
were
like
a
set
of
bad
cooks
boys
who
spat
vinegar
and
elderly
who
cooked
in
the
furnace
of
their
throats
a
sort
of
vocal
broth
a
thin
gruel
of
sound
nor
did
he
think
of
taking
refuge
in
thomas
aquinas
where
he
dreaded
the
barking
and
the
choruses
there
was
indeed
clotilde
where
the
psalmody
at
least
is
upright
and
has
not
like
that
of
thomas
lost
all
shame
he
went
there
but
again
encountered
dance
music
and
profane
tunes
a
worldly
orgie
at
last
he
went
to
bed
in
a
rage
saying
to
himself
in
paris
at
any
rate
a
singular
baptism
of
music
is
reserved
for
the
next
day
when
he
woke
he
felt
he
had
no
courage
to
face
the
churches
the
sacrileges
of
last
night
would
he
thought
continue
and
as
the
weather
was
almost
fine
he
went
out
wandered
in
the
luxembourg
gained
the
square
of
the
observatoire
and
the
boulevard
de
port
royal
and
mechanically
made
his
way
along
the
interminable
rue
de
la
santé
he
knew
that
street
of
old
and
had
taken
melancholy
walks
in
it
attracted
by
its
poor
houses
like
those
of
a
provincial
town
then
it
was
fit
for
a
dreamer
for
it
was
bounded
on
the
right
by
the
prison
de
la
santé
and
sainte
anne
madhouse
and
on
the
left
by
convents
light
and
air
circulated
in
the
street
but
behind
it
all
was
black
it
was
a
kind
of
prison
corridor
with
cells
on
either
side
where
some
were
condemned
to
temporary
sentences
and
others
of
their
own
free
will
suffered
lasting
sorrows
i
can
imagine
thought
durtal
how
it
would
have
been
painted
by
an
early
flemish
master
the
long
street
paved
by
patient
pencils
the
stories
open
from
top
to
bottom
and
the
cupboards
the
same
and
on
one
side
massive
cells
with
iron
bedsteads
a
stoneware
jug
little
peepholes
in
the
doors
secured
by
strong
bolts
inside
scoundrels
and
thieves
gnashing
their
teeth
turning
round
and
round
their
hair
on
end
howling
like
caged
animals
on
the
other
side
little
rooms
furnished
with
a
a
stoneware
jug
a
crucifix
these
also
closed
by
doors
and
within
nuns
or
monks
kneeling
on
the
flags
their
faces
clean
cut
against
the
light
of
a
halo
their
eyes
lifted
to
heaven
their
hands
joined
raised
from
the
ground
in
ecstasy
a
pot
of
lilies
at
their
side
then
at
the
back
of
the
canvas
between
these
two
rows
of
houses
rises
a
great
avenue
at
the
end
of
which
in
a
dappled
sky
sits
god
the
father
with
christ
on
his
right
choirs
of
seraphim
playing
on
guitar
and
viol
god
the
father
immovable
under
his
lofty
tiara
his
breast
covered
by
his
long
beard
holds
scales
which
balance
exactly
the
holy
captives
expiating
precisely
by
their
penances
and
prayers
the
blasphemies
of
the
rascals
and
the
insane
it
must
be
admitted
thought
durtal
that
this
street
is
very
peculiar
that
there
is
probably
none
like
it
in
paris
for
it
unites
in
its
course
virtues
and
vices
which
in
other
quarters
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
church
trend
apart
as
far
as
possible
from
each
other
thus
thinking
he
had
come
as
far
as
anne
where
the
street
grows
lighter
and
the
houses
are
lower
with
only
one
or
two
stories
then
gradually
there
is
greater
space
between
them
and
they
are
only
joined
to
each
other
by
blank
ends
of
walls
at
any
rate
thought
durtal
if
this
street
has
no
distinction
it
is
very
private
here
at
least
one
need
not
admire
the
impertinent
decoration
of
those
modern
shops
which
expose
in
their
windows
as
precious
commodities
chosen
piles
of
firewood
and
in
glass
sweetmeat
jars
coal
drops
and
coke
lollipops
and
here
is
an
odd
lane
and
he
looked
at
an
alley
which
led
down
a
sharp
decline
into
a
main
street
where
was
to
be
seen
the
tricolor
flag
in
zinc
on
a
washhouse
he
read
the
name
rue
de
he
entered
it
it
was
but
a
few
yards
long
the
whole
of
one
side
was
occupied
by
a
wall
behind
which
were
half
seen
some
stunted
buildings
surmounted
by
a
bell
an
with
a
square
wicket
was
placed
in
the
wall
which
was
raised
higher
as
it
sloped
downwards
and
at
the
end
was
pierced
by
round
windows
and
rose
into
a
little
building
surmounted
by
a
so
low
that
its
point
did
not
even
reach
the
height
of
the
house
opposite
on
the
other
side
three
hovels
sloped
down
closely
packed
together
zinc
pipes
ran
everywhere
growing
like
vines
ramifying
like
the
stalks
of
a
hollow
vine
along
the
walls
windows
gaped
on
rusty
leaden
hinges
dim
courts
of
wretched
hovels
could
be
seen
in
one
was
a
shed
where
some
cows
were
reposing
in
two
others
were
for
and
a
rack
behind
the
bars
of
which
appeared
the
capsuled
necks
of
bottles
but
this
must
be
a
church
thought
durtal
looking
at
the
little
clock
tower
and
the
three
or
four
round
bays
which
seemed
cut
out
in
emery
paper
to
look
like
the
black
rough
mortar
of
the
wall
where
is
the
entrance
he
found
it
on
turning
out
of
the
alley
into
the
rue
de
la
glacière
a
tiny
porch
gave
access
to
the
building
he
opened
the
door
and
entered
a
large
room
a
sort
of
closed
shed
painted
yellow
with
a
flat
ceiling
with
small
iron
beams
coloured
grey
picked
out
with
blue
and
ornamented
with
like
a
wine
shop
at
the
end
was
a
marble
altar
six
lighted
tapers
and
gilt
ornaments
candelabra
full
of
tapers
and
under
the
tabernacle
a
very
small
monstrance
which
sparkled
in
the
light
of
the
tapers
it
was
almost
dark
the
panes
of
the
windows
having
been
crudely
daubed
with
bands
of
indigo
and
yellowish
green
it
was
freezing
the
stove
was
not
alight
and
the
church
paved
like
a
kitchen
floor
had
no
matting
or
carpet
durtal
wrapped
himself
up
as
best
he
could
and
sat
down
his
eyes
gradually
grew
accustomed
to
the
obscurity
of
the
room
and
what
he
saw
was
strange
in
front
of
the
choir
on
rows
of
chairs
were
seated
human
forms
drowned
in
floods
of
white
muslin
no
one
stirred
suddenly
there
entered
by
a
side
door
a
nun
equally
wrapped
from
head
to
foot
in
a
large
veil
she
passed
along
the
altar
stopped
in
the
middle
threw
herself
on
the
ground
kissed
the
floor
and
by
a
sudden
effort
without
helping
herself
by
her
arms
stood
upright
advanced
silently
into
the
church
and
brushed
by
durtal
who
saw
under
the
muslin
a
magnificent
robe
of
creamy
white
an
ivory
cross
at
her
neck
at
her
girdle
a
white
cord
and
beads
she
went
to
the
and
there
ascended
a
little
staircase
into
a
gallery
which
commanded
the
church
he
asked
himself
what
could
be
this
order
so
sumptuously
arrayed
in
this
miserable
chapel
in
such
a
district
little
by
little
the
room
filled
in
red
with
capes
trimmed
with
rabbit
skin
lighted
the
candelabra
went
out
and
ushered
in
a
priest
vested
in
a
grand
cope
with
large
flowers
a
priest
tall
and
young
who
sat
down
and
in
a
sonorous
tone
chanted
the
first
antiphon
of
vespers
suddenly
durtal
turned
round
in
the
gallery
an
harmonium
accompanied
the
responses
of
voices
never
to
be
forgotten
it
was
not
a
voice
but
one
having
in
it
something
of
a
child
voice
sweetened
purified
sharpened
and
something
of
a
man
but
less
harsh
finer
and
more
sustained
an
unsexed
voice
filtered
through
litanies
bolted
by
prayers
passed
through
the
sieves
of
adoration
and
tears
the
priest
still
sitting
chanted
the
first
verse
of
the
unchanging
psalm
dixit
dominus
domino
meo
and
durtal
saw
in
the
air
in
the
gallery
tall
white
statues
holding
black
books
in
their
hands
chanting
slowly
with
eyes
raised
to
heaven
a
lamp
cast
its
light
on
one
of
these
figures
which
for
a
second
leant
forward
a
little
and
he
saw
under
the
lifted
veil
a
face
attentive
and
sorrowful
and
very
pale
the
verses
of
the
vesper
psalms
were
now
sung
alternately
by
the
nuns
above
and
by
the
congregation
below
the
chapel
was
almost
full
a
school
of
girls
in
white
veils
filled
one
side
little
girls
of
the
poorly
dressed
brats
who
played
with
their
dolls
occupied
the
other
there
were
a
few
poor
women
in
and
no
men
the
atmosphere
became
extraordinary
the
warmth
of
the
souls
thawed
the
ice
of
the
room
here
were
not
the
vespers
of
the
rich
such
as
were
celebrated
on
sundays
at
sulpice
but
the
vespers
of
the
poor
domestic
vespers
in
the
plain
chant
of
the
country
side
followed
by
the
faithful
with
mighty
fervour
in
silent
and
singular
devotion
durtal
could
fancy
himself
transported
beyond
the
city
to
the
depths
of
some
village
cloister
he
felt
himself
softened
his
soul
rocked
by
the
monotonous
amplitude
of
these
chants
only
recognizing
the
end
of
the
psalms
by
the
return
of
the
doxology
the
gloria
patri
et
filio
which
separated
them
from
each
other
he
had
a
real
impulse
a
dim
need
of
praying
to
the
unknowable
penetrated
to
the
very
marrow
by
this
environment
of
aspiration
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
thawed
a
little
and
took
a
part
in
the
united
tenderness
of
these
bright
spirits
he
sought
for
a
prayer
and
recalled
what
paphnutius
taught
thais
when
he
cried
thou
art
not
worthy
to
name
the
name
of
god
thou
wilt
pray
only
thus
plasmasti
me
miserere
mei
thou
who
hast
formed
me
have
mercy
on
me
he
stammered
out
the
humble
phrase
prayed
not
out
of
love
or
of
contrition
but
out
of
disgust
with
himself
unable
to
let
himself
go
regretting
that
he
could
not
love
then
he
thought
of
saying
the
prayer
but
stopped
at
the
notion
that
this
is
the
hardest
of
all
prayers
to
pronounce
when
the
phrases
are
weighed
in
the
balance
for
in
it
we
declare
to
god
that
we
forgive
our
neighbours
trespasses
now
how
many
who
use
these
words
forgive
others
how
many
catholics
do
not
lie
when
they
tell
the
that
they
hate
no
one
he
was
roused
from
these
reflections
by
sudden
silence
vespers
were
over
then
the
organ
played
again
and
all
the
voices
of
the
nuns
joined
those
in
the
choir
below
and
in
the
gallery
above
singing
the
old
carol
unto
us
a
child
is
born
he
listened
moved
by
the
simplicity
of
the
strain
and
suddenly
in
a
minute
brutally
without
understanding
why
infamous
thoughts
filled
his
mind
he
resisted
in
disgust
wished
to
repulse
the
assault
of
these
shameful
feelings
and
they
were
persistent
he
seemed
to
see
before
him
a
woman
whose
perverse
ways
had
long
maddened
him
all
at
once
this
hallucination
ceased
his
eye
was
mechanically
attracted
towards
the
priest
who
was
looking
at
him
while
speaking
in
a
low
voice
to
a
beadle
he
lost
his
head
imagining
that
the
priest
guessed
his
thoughts
and
was
turning
him
out
but
this
notion
was
so
foolish
that
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
more
sensibly
thought
that
men
were
not
admitted
to
this
convent
of
women
and
that
the
abbé
who
had
seen
him
was
sending
the
beadle
to
beg
him
to
leave
the
beadle
came
straight
to
him
durtal
was
ready
to
take
his
hat
when
in
persuasive
and
gentle
tones
that
functionary
said
that
the
procession
was
about
to
begin
that
it
was
the
custom
for
the
gentlemen
to
follow
the
blessed
sacrament
and
that
although
he
was
the
only
man
there
the
abbé
thought
he
would
not
refuse
to
follow
the
procession
about
to
start
overwhelmed
by
this
request
durtal
made
a
vague
gesture
in
which
the
beadle
seemed
to
see
assent
no
he
thought
as
soon
as
he
was
left
alone
i
will
not
meddle
with
the
ceremony
first
i
know
nothing
about
it
and
i
should
spoil
it
all
and
again
i
will
not
make
a
fool
of
myself
he
prepared
to
slip
away
quietly
but
he
had
no
time
to
carry
out
his
intention
the
usher
brought
him
a
lighted
candle
and
asked
him
to
accompany
him
he
put
the
best
face
he
could
on
the
matter
and
while
thinking
that
he
was
blushing
all
over
he
followed
the
beadle
to
the
altar
there
the
beadle
stopped
him
and
bid
him
not
to
move
the
whole
congregation
was
now
standing
the
girls
school
divided
into
two
files
preceded
by
a
woman
carrying
a
banner
durtal
came
in
front
of
the
first
rank
of
nuns
their
veils
lowered
before
the
profane
even
in
church
were
raised
before
the
blessed
sacrament
before
god
durtal
was
able
to
look
at
these
sisters
for
a
moment
at
first
his
disillusion
was
complete
he
had
supposed
them
pale
and
grave
like
the
nun
he
had
seen
in
the
gallery
and
almost
all
of
them
were
red
freckled
crossing
their
poor
hands
swelled
and
wounded
by
chilblains
their
faces
were
puffy
and
all
seemed
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
a
cold
they
were
evidently
country
girls
and
the
novices
known
by
their
grey
robes
under
the
white
veil
were
still
more
common
looking
they
had
certainly
been
accustomed
to
farm
labour
and
yet
on
seeing
them
all
turned
to
the
altar
the
poverty
of
their
faces
the
ugliness
of
their
hands
blue
with
cold
their
broken
nails
injured
in
the
wash
disappeared
their
eyes
modest
and
humble
under
their
long
lashes
changed
their
coarse
features
into
pious
simplicity
lost
in
prayer
they
did
not
even
see
his
curious
looks
and
did
not
even
suspect
a
man
was
there
examining
them
durtal
envied
the
admirable
wisdom
of
these
poor
girls
who
alone
understood
it
was
mad
to
wish
to
live
he
thought
ignorance
leads
to
the
same
result
as
knowledge
among
the
carmelites
are
rich
and
pretty
women
who
have
lived
in
the
world
and
left
it
wholly
convinced
of
the
vainness
of
its
joys
and
these
nuns
who
evidently
know
nothing
have
had
an
intuition
of
that
vacuity
which
it
has
needed
years
of
experience
for
the
others
to
gain
by
different
ways
they
have
arrived
at
the
same
then
what
clearness
of
thought
is
revealed
by
their
entrance
into
an
order
for
if
indeed
they
had
not
been
gathered
by
christ
what
would
have
become
of
these
unhappy
girls
married
to
drunkards
and
hammered
by
beatings
or
perhaps
maids
in
taverns
by
their
masters
brutalized
by
the
other
servants
destined
to
the
scorn
of
the
streets
and
the
dangers
of
and
without
knowing
anything
they
have
avoided
it
all
have
remained
innocent
far
from
these
perils
and
far
from
this
defilement
under
an
obedience
which
is
not
ignoble
disposed
by
their
very
way
of
life
to
experience
should
they
be
worthy
the
most
powerful
joys
which
the
soul
of
a
human
creature
can
feel
they
remain
perhaps
beasts
of
burthen
but
at
any
rate
god
beasts
of
burthen
he
had
got
so
far
in
his
reflections
when
the
beadle
beckoned
to
him
the
priest
who
had
descended
from
the
altar
held
the
little
monstrance
the
girls
procession
was
moving
before
him
durtal
passed
in
front
of
the
line
of
nuns
who
did
not
take
part
in
the
ceremony
and
torch
in
hand
he
followed
the
beadle
who
carried
behind
the
priest
an
open
white
silk
parasol
then
the
harmonium
in
the
gallery
filled
the
church
with
its
drawling
tones
like
an
enlarged
accordion
and
the
nuns
standing
beside
it
intoned
the
old
chant
rhythmical
as
a
march
the
adeste
fideles
while
below
the
novices
and
the
faithful
repeated
after
each
stanza
the
sweet
chorus
of
invitation
venite
adoremus
the
procession
went
several
times
round
the
chapel
above
the
heads
bowed
in
the
smoke
from
the
censers
which
the
choir
boys
swung
turning
at
each
pause
to
face
the
priest
well
after
all
i
have
not
come
so
badly
out
of
it
said
durtal
to
himself
when
they
had
returned
to
the
altar
he
thought
his
part
was
finished
but
this
time
without
asking
his
permission
the
beadle
asked
him
to
kneel
at
the
communion
rail
in
front
of
the
altar
he
was
ill
at
ease
and
annoyed
at
knowing
that
the
whole
school
and
the
whole
convent
was
behind
him
nor
was
he
accustomed
to
kneel
it
seemed
as
if
wedges
were
thrust
into
his
limbs
as
if
he
were
subjected
to
the
tortures
of
the
middle
ages
embarrassed
by
his
taper
which
was
guttering
and
threatened
to
cover
him
with
spots
he
shifted
his
position
quietly
trying
to
make
himself
more
comfortable
by
slipping
the
skirts
of
his
great
coat
between
his
knees
and
the
steps
but
in
moving
he
only
increased
the
evil
his
flesh
was
folded
back
between
the
bones
and
his
skin
was
chafed
and
burning
he
sweated
at
last
with
the
pain
and
feared
to
distract
the
fervour
of
the
community
by
falling
while
the
ceremony
went
on
for
ever
the
nuns
sang
in
the
gallery
but
he
listened
no
more
and
deplored
the
length
of
the
service
at
last
the
moment
of
benediction
approached
then
in
spite
of
himself
seeing
himself
there
so
near
to
god
durtal
forgot
his
sufferings
and
bowed
his
head
ashamed
to
be
so
placed
like
a
captain
at
the
head
of
his
company
in
the
first
rank
of
this
maiden
troop
and
when
in
a
great
silence
the
bell
tinkled
and
the
priest
turning
lightly
cut
the
air
in
the
form
of
a
cross
and
with
the
blessed
sacrament
blessed
the
congregation
kneeling
at
his
feet
durtal
remained
his
body
bent
his
eyes
closed
seeking
to
hide
himself
to
make
himself
small
and
not
be
seen
there
in
front
amid
that
pious
crowd
the
psalm
laudate
dominum
omnes
gentes
rang
out
when
the
beadle
came
to
take
his
taper
durtal
could
hardly
resist
a
cry
when
he
had
to
stand
up
his
benumbed
knees
cracked
and
their
joints
would
hardly
work
yet
he
regained
his
place
somehow
let
the
crowd
pass
and
approaching
the
beadle
asked
him
the
name
of
the
convent
and
the
order
to
which
the
nuns
belonged
they
are
the
franciscan
missionaries
of
mary
answered
the
man
but
the
chapel
is
not
theirs
as
you
seem
to
think
it
is
a
chapel
of
ease
for
the
parish
of
marcel
de
la
maison
blanche
it
is
only
joined
by
a
corridor
to
the
house
those
sisters
occupy
behind
us
there
in
the
rue
de
they
join
in
the
offices
in
fact
just
as
you
and
i
may
do
and
they
keep
a
school
for
the
children
of
the
district
it
is
a
touching
little
chapel
thought
durtal
when
he
was
alone
it
is
well
matched
with
the
neighbourhood
it
shelters
with
the
gloomy
brook
of
the
tanners
which
runs
through
the
yards
below
the
rue
de
la
glacière
it
gives
me
the
effect
of
being
to
notre
dame
de
paris
what
its
neighbour
the
bièvre
is
to
the
seine
it
is
the
streamlet
of
the
church
the
pious
pavement
the
miserable
suburb
of
worship
how
poor
and
yet
how
exquisite
are
those
nuns
voices
which
seem
and
mellow
god
knows
how
i
hate
the
voice
of
a
woman
in
the
holy
place
for
it
still
remains
unclean
i
think
woman
always
brings
with
her
the
lasting
miasma
of
her
indispositions
and
she
turns
the
psalms
sour
then
all
the
same
vanity
and
concupiscence
rise
from
the
worldly
voice
and
its
cries
of
adoration
accompanied
by
the
organ
are
only
cries
of
carnal
desire
its
very
pleadings
in
the
most
sombre
liturgical
hymns
are
only
addressed
to
god
from
the
lips
outward
for
at
bottom
a
woman
only
mourns
the
mediocre
ideal
of
earthly
pleasure
to
which
she
can
not
attain
thus
i
thoroughly
understand
that
the
church
has
rejected
woman
from
her
offices
and
that
the
musical
robe
of
her
sequences
may
not
be
contaminated
she
employs
the
voices
of
the
boy
and
the
man
yet
in
convents
of
women
that
is
changed
it
is
certain
that
prayer
communion
abstinence
and
vows
purify
the
body
and
the
soul
as
well
as
the
vocal
odour
which
proceeds
from
them
the
emanations
from
them
give
to
the
voices
of
the
nuns
however
crude
however
they
may
be
their
chaste
inflexions
their
simple
caresses
of
pure
love
they
recall
to
it
the
ingenuous
sounds
of
childhood
in
certain
orders
they
seem
even
to
prune
it
of
the
greater
part
of
its
branches
and
concentrate
the
threads
of
sap
which
remain
in
a
few
twigs
and
he
thought
of
a
carmelite
convent
to
which
he
had
gone
from
time
to
time
remembered
their
failing
almost
expiring
voices
where
the
little
health
that
remained
to
them
was
concentrated
in
three
notes
voices
which
had
lost
the
musical
colours
of
life
the
tints
of
open
air
keeping
only
in
the
cloister
those
of
the
costumes
they
seemed
to
reflect
white
and
brown
chaste
and
sombre
tones
ah
those
carmelites
he
thought
of
them
now
as
he
descended
the
rue
de
la
glacière
and
he
called
up
the
memory
of
a
profession
the
thought
of
which
took
entire
possession
of
him
every
time
he
meditated
on
convents
he
saw
again
in
memory
a
morning
in
the
little
chapel
in
the
avenue
de
saxe
a
chapel
spanish
gothic
in
style
with
narrow
windows
glazed
with
panes
so
dark
that
the
light
which
remained
in
their
colours
did
not
pass
through
them
at
the
end
rose
the
high
altar
in
shade
raised
on
six
steps
on
the
left
a
large
iron
grating
in
an
arch
was
covered
with
a
black
curtain
and
on
the
same
side
but
almost
at
the
base
of
the
altar
a
little
arch
traced
on
the
plain
wall
like
a
lancet
window
with
an
aperture
in
the
middle
a
sort
of
square
a
frame
without
a
panel
empty
that
morning
the
chapel
cold
and
dark
sparkled
lighted
by
groves
of
candles
and
the
odour
of
incense
not
adulterated
as
in
other
churches
by
spices
and
gums
filled
it
with
a
dull
smoke
it
was
crammed
with
people
crouched
in
a
corner
durtal
had
turned
round
and
like
his
neighbours
looked
at
the
backs
of
the
thurifers
and
priests
who
were
going
towards
the
entrance
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
he
saw
in
a
burst
of
daylight
a
red
vision
of
the
cardinal
archbishop
of
paris
passing
up
the
nave
turning
from
side
to
side
a
head
in
front
of
it
a
big
spectacled
nose
bending
his
tall
form
all
on
one
side
blessing
the
congregation
with
a
long
twisted
hand
like
a
claw
he
and
his
suite
ascended
the
altar
steps
and
knelt
at
a
then
they
took
off
his
tippet
and
vested
him
in
a
silk
chasuble
with
a
white
cross
embroidered
in
silver
and
the
mass
began
shortly
before
the
communion
the
black
veil
was
gently
withdrawn
behind
the
high
grating
and
in
a
blueish
light
like
that
of
the
moon
durtal
faintly
saw
white
phantoms
gliding
and
stars
twinking
in
the
air
and
close
to
the
grating
a
woman
form
kneeling
motionless
on
the
ground
she
too
holding
a
star
at
the
end
of
a
taper
the
woman
did
not
move
but
the
star
shook
then
when
the
moment
of
communion
was
at
hand
the
woman
rose
then
disappeared
and
her
head
as
if
decapitated
filled
the
square
of
the
wicket
opened
in
the
arch
then
as
he
leant
forward
he
saw
for
a
second
a
dead
face
with
closed
lids
white
eyeless
like
ancient
marble
statues
and
all
passed
away
as
the
cardinal
bent
above
the
grating
with
the
ciborium
in
his
hand
all
was
so
rapid
that
he
asked
himself
if
he
were
not
dreaming
the
mass
was
over
behind
the
iron
grating
resounded
mournful
psalms
slow
chants
drawn
out
weeping
always
on
the
same
notes
wandering
lights
and
white
forms
passed
in
the
azure
fluid
of
the
incense
monseigneur
richard
was
sitting
mitre
on
head
interrogating
the
postulant
who
had
returned
to
her
place
and
was
kneeling
before
him
behind
the
grating
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
could
not
be
heard
the
whole
congregation
bent
to
listen
to
the
novice
as
she
pronounced
her
vows
but
only
a
long
murmur
was
heard
durtal
remembered
that
he
had
elbowed
his
way
and
got
near
the
choir
where
through
the
crossed
bars
of
the
grating
he
saw
the
woman
clad
in
white
prostrate
on
her
face
in
a
square
of
flowers
while
the
whole
convent
filed
past
bending
over
her
intoning
the
psalms
for
the
dead
and
sprinkling
her
with
holy
water
like
a
corpse
it
is
admirable
he
cried
moved
in
the
street
by
the
memory
of
the
scene
and
he
thought
of
what
a
life
was
that
of
these
women
to
lie
on
an
hair
mattress
without
pillow
or
sheets
to
fast
seven
months
out
of
the
twelve
except
on
sundays
and
feasts
always
to
eat
standing
vegetables
and
abstinence
fare
to
have
no
fire
in
winter
to
chant
for
hours
on
tiles
to
scourge
the
body
to
become
so
humble
as
however
tenderly
nurtured
to
wash
up
dishes
with
joy
and
attend
to
the
meanest
tasks
to
pray
from
morning
to
midnight
even
to
fainting
to
pray
there
till
death
they
must
indeed
pity
us
and
set
themselves
to
expiate
the
imbecility
of
a
world
which
treats
them
as
hysterical
fools
for
it
can
not
even
understand
the
joy
in
suffering
of
souls
like
these
we
can
not
be
proud
of
ourselves
in
thinking
of
the
carmelites
or
even
of
those
humble
franciscan
tertiaries
who
are
after
all
more
vulgar
it
is
true
they
do
not
belong
to
a
contemplative
order
but
all
the
same
their
rules
are
very
strict
their
existence
is
so
hard
that
they
too
can
atone
by
their
prayers
and
good
works
for
the
crimes
of
the
city
they
protect
he
grew
enthusiastic
in
thinking
of
the
convents
ah
to
be
earthed
up
among
them
sheltered
from
the
herd
not
to
know
what
books
appear
what
newspapers
are
printed
never
to
know
what
goes
on
outside
one
cell
among
men
to
complete
the
beneficent
silence
of
this
cloistered
life
nourishing
ourselves
with
good
actions
refreshing
ourselves
with
plain
song
saturating
ourselves
with
the
inexhaustible
joys
of
the
liturgies
then
who
knows
by
force
of
good
will
and
by
ardent
prayer
to
succeed
in
coming
to
him
in
entertaining
him
feeling
him
near
us
perhaps
almost
satisfied
with
his
creature
and
he
called
up
before
him
the
joys
of
those
abbeys
in
which
jesus
abode
he
remembered
that
astonishing
convent
of
unterlinden
near
colmar
where
in
the
thirteenth
century
not
only
one
or
two
nuns
but
the
whole
convent
rose
distractedly
before
christ
with
cries
of
joy
nuns
were
lifted
above
the
ground
others
heard
the
songs
of
seraphim
and
their
emaciated
bodies
secreted
balm
others
became
transparent
or
were
crowned
with
stars
all
these
phenomena
of
the
contemplative
life
were
visible
in
that
cloister
a
high
school
of
mysticism
thus
wrapped
in
thought
he
found
himself
at
his
own
door
without
remembering
the
road
he
had
taken
and
as
soon
as
he
was
in
his
room
his
whole
soul
dilated
and
burst
forth
he
desired
to
thank
to
call
for
mercy
to
appeal
to
someone
he
knew
not
whom
to
complain
of
he
knew
not
what
all
at
once
the
need
of
pouring
himself
forth
of
going
out
of
himself
took
shape
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
saying
to
our
lady
have
pity
on
me
and
hear
me
i
would
rather
anything
than
continue
this
shaken
existence
these
idle
stages
without
an
aim
pardon
me
holy
virgin
unclean
as
i
am
for
i
have
no
courage
for
the
battle
ah
wouldest
thou
grant
my
prayer
i
know
well
that
i
am
over
bold
in
daring
to
ask
since
i
am
not
even
resolved
to
turn
out
my
soul
to
empty
it
like
a
bucket
of
filth
to
strike
it
on
the
bottom
that
the
lees
may
trickle
out
and
the
scales
fall
off
but
but
thou
knowest
i
am
so
weak
so
little
sure
of
myself
that
in
truth
i
shrink
oh
all
the
same
i
would
desire
to
flee
away
a
thousand
miles
from
paris
i
know
not
where
into
a
cloister
my
god
yet
this
is
very
madness
that
i
speak
for
i
could
not
stay
two
days
in
a
convent
nor
indeed
would
they
take
me
in
then
he
thought
though
this
once
i
am
less
dry
less
unclean
than
is
my
wont
i
can
find
nothing
to
say
to
our
lady
but
insanities
and
follies
when
it
would
be
so
simple
to
ask
her
pardon
to
beg
her
to
have
pity
on
my
desolate
life
to
aid
me
to
resist
the
demands
of
my
vices
not
to
pay
as
i
do
the
royalties
on
my
nerves
the
tax
on
my
senses
all
the
same
he
said
rising
enough
of
this
i
will
at
least
do
what
little
i
can
without
more
delay
i
will
go
to
the
abbé
i
will
explain
the
struggle
of
my
soul
and
we
will
see
what
happens
afterwards
chapter
he
was
really
comforted
when
the
servant
said
that
monsieur
was
at
home
he
entered
a
little
and
waited
till
the
priest
whom
he
heard
speaking
to
someone
in
the
next
chamber
was
alone
he
looked
at
the
little
room
and
marked
that
nothing
was
changed
since
his
last
visit
it
was
still
furnished
with
a
velvet
sofa
of
which
the
red
once
crimson
had
become
the
faded
rose
colour
of
raspberry
jam
on
bread
there
were
also
two
tall
on
either
side
of
the
chimney
which
was
ornamented
by
an
empire
clock
and
some
china
vases
filled
with
sand
in
which
were
stuck
some
dry
stalks
of
reed
in
a
corner
against
the
wall
under
an
old
wooden
crucifix
was
a
marked
by
the
knees
an
oval
table
in
the
centre
some
sacred
engravings
on
the
walls
and
that
was
all
it
is
like
an
hotel
or
an
old
maid
lodging
thought
durtal
the
commonness
of
the
furniture
the
curtains
in
faded
damask
the
panels
hung
with
a
paper
covered
with
bouquets
of
poppies
and
in
false
colours
were
like
lodgings
by
the
month
but
certain
details
above
all
the
scrupulous
cleanliness
of
the
room
the
worked
cushions
on
the
sofa
the
grass
mats
under
the
chairs
an
hortensia
like
a
painted
cauliflower
placed
in
a
covered
with
lace
looked
on
the
other
hand
like
the
futile
and
icy
room
of
a
devout
woman
nothing
was
wanting
but
a
cage
of
canaries
photographs
in
plush
frames
and
crochet
mats
durtal
had
got
so
far
in
his
reflections
when
the
abbé
came
in
with
extended
hand
gently
finding
fault
with
his
long
absence
durtal
made
what
excuses
he
could
unusual
occupations
long
weariness
and
our
blessed
lidwine
how
do
you
get
on
with
her
ah
i
have
not
even
begun
her
life
i
am
not
in
a
state
of
mind
which
allows
me
to
engage
in
it
durtal
accent
of
discouragement
surprised
the
priest
come
what
is
the
matter
can
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
i
do
not
know
monsieur
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
talk
to
you
about
such
troubles
and
suddenly
he
burst
out
telling
his
sorrows
in
any
chance
words
declaring
the
unreality
of
his
conversion
his
struggles
with
the
flesh
his
human
respect
his
neglect
of
religious
practices
his
aversion
from
the
rites
demanded
of
him
in
fact
from
all
yokes
the
abbé
listened
without
moving
his
chin
on
his
hand
you
are
more
than
forty
he
said
when
durtal
was
silent
you
have
passed
the
age
when
without
any
impulse
from
thought
the
awakening
of
the
flesh
excites
temptations
you
are
now
in
that
period
when
indecent
thoughts
first
present
themselves
to
the
imagination
before
the
senses
are
agitated
we
have
then
to
fight
less
against
your
sleeping
body
than
your
mind
which
stimulates
and
vexes
it
on
the
other
hand
you
have
arrears
and
prizes
of
affection
to
put
out
you
have
no
wife
or
children
to
receive
them
so
that
your
affections
being
driven
back
by
celibacy
you
will
end
by
taking
them
there
where
at
first
they
should
have
been
placed
you
try
to
appease
your
soul
hunger
in
chapels
and
as
you
hesitate
as
you
have
not
the
courage
to
come
to
a
decision
to
break
once
for
all
with
your
vices
you
have
arrived
at
this
strange
compromise
to
reserve
your
tender
feeling
for
the
church
and
the
manifestations
of
that
feeling
for
women
that
if
i
do
not
mistake
is
your
correct
but
good
heavens
you
have
not
too
much
to
complain
of
for
do
you
not
see
that
the
important
thing
is
to
care
for
woman
only
with
your
bodily
senses
when
heaven
has
given
you
grace
to
be
no
longer
taken
captive
by
thought
all
may
be
arranged
with
a
little
effort
of
will
this
is
an
indulgent
priest
thought
durtal
but
continued
the
abbé
you
can
not
always
sit
between
two
stools
the
moment
will
come
when
you
must
stick
to
the
one
and
push
the
other
away
and
looking
at
durtal
who
looked
down
without
answering
do
you
pray
i
do
not
ask
if
you
say
your
morning
prayers
for
not
all
those
who
end
by
entering
on
the
divine
way
after
wandering
for
years
where
chance
might
take
them
call
on
the
lord
so
soon
as
they
awake
at
break
of
day
the
soul
thinks
itself
well
thinks
itself
firmer
and
at
once
takes
occasion
of
this
fleeting
energy
to
forget
god
it
is
with
the
soul
as
with
the
body
when
it
is
sick
when
night
comes
our
sensations
are
stronger
pain
which
was
quieted
awakes
the
fever
which
slept
blazes
up
again
filth
revives
and
wounds
bleed
anew
and
then
it
thinks
of
the
divine
it
thinks
of
christ
do
you
pray
in
the
evening
sometimes
and
yet
it
is
very
difficult
the
afternoon
is
tolerable
but
you
say
truly
when
the
daylight
goes
evils
spring
up
a
whole
cavalcade
of
obscene
ideas
then
pass
through
my
brain
how
can
any
one
be
recollected
at
such
moments
if
you
do
not
feel
able
to
resist
in
the
street
or
at
home
why
do
you
not
take
refuge
in
the
churches
but
they
are
closed
when
one
has
most
need
of
them
the
clergy
put
jesus
to
bed
at
nightfall
i
know
it
but
if
most
churches
are
closed
there
are
a
few
which
remain
partly
open
very
late
ah
sulpice
is
among
the
number
and
there
is
one
which
remains
open
every
evening
and
where
those
who
visit
it
are
always
sure
of
prayers
and
benediction
notre
dame
des
victoires
i
think
you
know
it
yes
monsieur
it
is
ugly
enough
to
cause
tears
it
is
pretentious
it
is
in
bad
taste
and
the
singers
churn
up
a
margarine
of
rancid
tones
i
do
not
go
there
then
as
i
go
to
severin
and
sulpice
to
admire
there
the
art
of
the
old
of
god
to
listen
even
if
they
are
incorrectly
given
to
the
broad
familiar
melodies
of
plain
chant
notre
dame
des
victoires
is
worthless
from
the
æsthetic
point
of
view
and
yet
i
go
there
from
time
to
time
because
alone
in
paris
it
has
the
irresistible
attraction
of
true
piety
it
alone
preserves
intact
the
lost
soul
of
the
time
at
whatever
hour
one
goes
there
people
are
praying
there
prostrate
in
absolute
silence
it
is
full
as
soon
as
it
is
open
and
full
at
its
closing
there
is
a
constant
coming
and
going
of
pilgrims
from
all
parts
of
paris
arriving
from
the
depths
of
the
provinces
and
it
seems
that
each
one
by
the
prayers
that
he
brings
adds
fuel
to
the
immense
brazier
of
faith
whose
flames
break
out
again
under
the
smoky
arches
like
the
thousands
of
tapers
which
constantly
burn
and
are
renewed
from
morning
till
evening
before
our
lady
well
i
who
seek
the
most
deserted
corners
and
the
darkest
places
in
the
chapels
i
who
hate
mobs
mix
almost
willingly
with
those
i
find
there
because
there
everyone
is
isolated
no
one
is
concerned
with
his
neighbour
you
do
not
see
the
human
bodies
which
throng
you
but
you
feel
the
breath
of
souls
around
however
refractory
however
damp
you
may
be
you
end
by
taking
fire
at
this
contact
and
are
astonished
to
find
yourself
all
at
once
less
vile
it
seems
to
me
that
the
prayers
which
elsewhere
when
they
leave
my
lips
fall
back
to
the
ground
exhausted
and
chilled
spring
upwards
in
that
place
are
borne
on
by
others
grow
warm
and
soar
and
live
at
severin
i
have
indeed
experienced
the
sensation
of
a
help
spreading
from
the
pillars
and
running
through
the
arches
but
as
i
think
the
aid
is
less
strong
perhaps
since
the
middle
ages
that
church
makes
use
of
but
can
not
renew
the
celestial
effluvia
with
which
it
is
charged
while
at
notre
dame
the
help
which
springs
up
from
the
very
pavement
is
for
ever
vivified
by
the
uninterrupted
presence
of
an
ardent
crowd
in
the
one
it
is
the
impregnate
stone
the
church
itself
which
brings
consolation
in
the
other
it
is
above
all
things
the
fervour
of
the
crowds
which
fill
it
and
then
i
have
the
strange
impression
that
the
virgin
attracted
and
retained
by
so
great
faith
only
spends
a
little
while
in
other
churches
goes
there
as
a
visitor
but
has
made
her
home
and
really
resides
in
notre
dame
the
abbé
smiled
come
i
see
that
you
know
and
love
it
and
yet
the
church
is
not
on
our
left
bank
beyond
which
you
said
to
me
one
day
there
is
no
sanctuary
worth
having
yes
and
i
am
surprised
at
it
especially
as
it
is
placed
in
a
thoroughly
commercial
quarter
two
paces
from
the
exchange
whose
ignoble
shouts
can
be
heard
in
it
it
was
itself
an
exchange
said
the
abbé
in
what
way
after
having
been
baptized
by
the
monks
and
having
served
as
a
chapel
for
the
discalced
augustinians
it
was
horribly
desecrated
in
the
revolution
and
the
exchange
was
set
up
within
its
walls
i
was
not
aware
of
that
detail
said
durtal
but
continued
the
abbé
it
was
with
it
as
with
those
holy
women
who
if
we
believe
their
biographers
recovered
by
a
life
of
prayer
the
virginity
they
had
formerly
lost
our
lady
washed
it
from
its
violation
and
though
it
is
comparatively
modern
it
is
at
the
present
day
saturated
with
emanations
infused
by
effluences
of
angels
penetrated
with
divine
drugs
it
is
for
sick
souls
what
certain
thermal
springs
are
for
the
body
people
keep
their
season
there
make
their
novenas
and
obtain
their
cure
now
to
come
back
to
our
point
i
tell
you
you
will
do
wisely
if
on
your
bad
evenings
you
will
attend
benediction
in
that
church
i
shall
be
surprised
if
you
do
not
come
out
cleansed
and
at
peace
if
he
have
only
that
to
offer
me
it
is
little
enough
thought
durtal
and
after
a
disappointed
silence
he
rejoined
but
monsieur
even
were
i
to
visit
that
sanctuary
and
follow
the
offices
in
other
churches
when
temptations
assail
me
even
were
i
to
confess
and
draw
near
the
sacraments
how
would
that
advantage
me
i
should
meet
as
i
came
out
the
woman
whose
very
sight
inflames
my
senses
and
it
would
be
with
me
as
after
my
leaving
severin
all
unnerved
the
very
feeling
of
tenderness
which
i
had
in
the
chapel
would
destroy
me
and
i
should
fall
back
into
sin
what
do
you
know
about
it
and
the
priest
suddenly
rose
and
took
long
strides
through
the
room
you
have
no
right
to
speak
thus
for
the
virtue
of
the
sacrament
is
formal
the
man
who
has
communicated
is
no
longer
alone
he
is
armed
against
others
and
defended
against
himself
and
crossing
his
arms
before
durtal
he
exclaimed
to
lose
one
soul
for
the
pleasure
of
momentary
gratification
what
madness
and
since
the
time
of
your
conversion
does
not
that
disgust
you
yes
i
am
disgusted
with
myself
but
only
after
my
swinish
desires
are
satisfied
if
only
i
could
gain
true
repentance
rest
assured
said
the
abbé
who
sat
down
again
you
will
find
it
and
seeing
that
durtal
shook
his
head
remember
what
saint
teresa
said
trouble
of
those
who
are
beginning
is
that
they
can
not
recognize
whether
they
have
true
repentance
for
their
faults
but
they
have
it
and
the
proof
is
their
sincere
resolution
to
serve
god
think
of
that
sentence
for
it
applies
to
you
that
repugnance
to
your
sins
which
wearies
you
is
witness
to
your
regret
and
you
have
a
desire
to
serve
the
lord
since
you
are
in
fact
struggling
to
go
to
him
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
well
then
monsieur
what
is
your
advice
i
advise
you
to
pray
in
your
own
house
in
church
everywhere
as
much
as
you
can
i
do
not
prescribe
any
religious
remedy
i
simply
invite
you
to
profit
by
some
precepts
of
pious
hygiene
afterwards
we
will
see
durtal
remained
undecided
discontented
like
those
sick
persons
who
find
fault
with
doctors
who
to
satisfy
them
prescribe
only
colourless
drugs
the
priest
laughed
confess
he
said
looking
him
in
the
face
confess
that
you
are
saying
to
yourself
was
not
worth
while
to
put
myself
out
for
i
am
no
further
advanced
this
good
fellow
the
priest
practises
expectant
medicine
instead
of
cutting
short
my
crises
with
energetic
remedies
he
palters
advises
me
to
go
to
bed
early
not
to
catch
cold
oh
monsieur
protested
durtal
yet
i
do
not
wish
to
treat
you
like
a
child
or
talk
to
you
like
a
woman
now
attend
to
me
the
way
in
which
your
conversion
has
worked
leaves
me
in
no
doubt
whatever
there
has
been
what
mysticism
calls
the
divine
touch
only
note
this
god
has
dispensed
with
human
intervention
even
with
the
interference
of
a
priest
to
bring
you
back
into
the
road
you
have
left
for
more
than
twenty
years
now
we
can
not
reasonably
suppose
that
the
lord
has
acted
lightly
and
that
he
will
now
leave
his
work
unaccomplished
he
will
carry
it
through
if
you
put
no
obstacle
in
his
way
in
fact
you
are
at
this
moment
like
a
block
in
his
hands
what
will
he
do
with
it
i
do
not
know
but
since
he
has
kept
to
himself
the
conduct
of
your
soul
let
him
act
be
patient
he
will
explain
his
action
trust
in
him
he
will
help
you
be
content
to
protest
with
the
psalmist
me
facere
voluntatem
tuam
quia
deus
meus
es
tu
i
tell
you
again
i
believe
in
the
preventive
virtue
the
formal
power
of
the
sacraments
i
quite
understand
the
system
of
père
milleriot
who
obliged
those
persons
to
communicate
whom
he
thought
would
afterwards
fall
again
into
sin
for
their
only
penance
he
obliged
them
to
communicate
again
and
again
and
he
ended
by
purifying
them
with
the
sacred
species
taken
in
large
doses
it
is
a
doctrine
at
once
realistic
and
exalted
but
reassure
yourself
continued
the
abbé
looking
at
durtal
who
seemed
wearied
i
do
not
intend
to
experiment
on
you
in
this
way
on
the
contrary
my
advice
is
that
in
the
state
of
ignorance
in
which
we
are
of
god
will
you
abstain
from
the
sacraments
for
you
should
desire
them
and
it
should
come
from
you
rather
than
from
him
be
sure
that
sooner
or
later
you
will
thirst
for
penance
hunger
for
the
eucharist
well
when
unable
to
restrain
yourself
longer
you
ask
for
pardon
and
entreat
to
be
allowed
to
approach
the
holy
table
we
shall
see
we
will
ask
him
what
way
he
will
choose
to
take
in
order
to
save
you
but
there
are
not
i
presume
several
ways
of
confessing
and
communicating
certainly
not
that
is
just
what
i
meant
to
say
but
and
the
priest
hesitated
at
a
loss
for
words
it
is
quite
certain
he
began
again
that
art
has
been
the
principal
means
which
the
saviour
has
used
to
make
you
absorb
the
faith
he
has
taken
you
on
your
weak
side
or
strong
side
if
you
like
that
better
he
has
infused
into
your
nature
the
chief
mystical
works
he
has
persuaded
and
converted
you
less
by
the
way
of
reason
than
the
way
of
the
senses
and
indeed
those
are
the
special
conditions
you
have
to
take
into
account
on
the
other
hand
your
soul
is
not
humble
and
simple
you
are
a
sort
of
whom
the
least
imprudence
the
least
stupidity
of
a
confessor
would
at
once
repel
therefore
that
you
may
not
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
troublesome
impression
certain
precautions
must
be
taken
in
the
state
of
weakness
and
feebleness
in
which
you
are
a
disagreeable
face
an
unlucky
word
antipathetic
surroundings
a
mere
nothing
would
be
enough
to
rout
you
is
it
not
so
alas
sighed
durtal
i
am
obliged
to
answer
that
you
are
right
but
monsieur
i
do
not
think
i
shall
have
to
fear
such
disillusions
if
when
the
moment
you
predict
has
come
you
will
allow
me
to
make
my
confession
to
you
the
priest
was
silent
for
a
while
then
said
no
doubt
since
i
have
met
you
i
may
probably
be
useful
to
you
but
i
have
an
idea
that
my
part
will
be
confined
to
pointing
out
the
road
to
you
i
shall
be
a
connecting
link
and
nothing
more
you
will
end
as
you
have
begun
without
help
alone
the
abbé
remained
in
thought
then
shook
his
head
and
went
on
let
us
leave
the
subject
however
for
we
can
not
anticipate
the
designs
of
god
to
sum
up
try
to
stifle
in
prayer
your
attacks
of
the
flesh
it
is
a
less
matter
not
to
be
overcome
at
the
moment
than
to
direct
all
your
efforts
not
to
be
so
then
the
priest
added
gently
to
rouse
the
spirits
of
durtal
whom
he
saw
to
be
depressed
if
you
fall
do
not
despair
and
throw
the
handle
after
the
hatchet
say
to
yourself
that
after
all
lust
is
not
the
most
unpardonable
of
faults
that
it
is
one
of
two
sins
for
which
the
human
being
pays
cash
and
which
are
consequently
expiated
in
part
at
least
before
death
say
to
yourself
that
wantonness
and
avarice
refuse
all
credit
and
will
not
wait
and
in
fact
whoever
unlawfully
commits
a
fleshly
act
is
almost
always
punished
in
his
lifetime
for
some
there
are
bastards
to
provide
for
sickly
wives
low
connections
broken
careers
abominable
deceptions
on
the
part
of
those
they
have
loved
on
whichever
side
we
turn
when
women
are
concerned
we
have
to
suffer
for
she
is
the
most
powerful
instrument
of
sorrow
which
god
has
given
to
man
it
is
the
same
with
the
passion
for
gain
every
being
who
allows
himself
to
be
overcome
by
that
hateful
sin
pays
for
it
as
a
rule
before
his
death
look
at
the
panama
business
cooks
housekeepers
small
proprietors
who
till
then
had
lived
in
peace
seeking
no
inordinate
gains
no
illicit
profit
threw
themselves
like
madmen
into
that
business
they
had
one
only
thought
to
gain
money
the
chastisement
of
their
cupidity
was
as
you
know
sudden
yes
said
durtal
laughing
the
de
lesseps
were
the
agents
of
providence
when
they
stole
the
savings
of
fools
who
had
moreover
got
them
probably
by
thieving
in
a
word
said
the
abbé
i
repeat
my
last
advice
do
not
be
at
all
discouraged
if
you
sink
do
not
despise
yourself
too
much
have
the
courage
to
enter
a
church
afterwards
for
the
devil
catches
you
by
cowardice
the
false
shame
the
false
humility
he
suggests
nourish
maintain
solidify
your
wantonness
in
some
measure
well
no
come
and
see
me
soon
again
durtal
found
himself
in
the
street
a
little
confused
it
is
evident
he
murmured
as
he
stalked
along
that
the
abbé
gévresin
is
a
clever
spiritual
watchmaker
he
has
dexterously
taken
to
pieces
the
movement
of
my
passions
and
made
the
hours
of
idleness
and
weariness
strike
but
after
all
his
advice
comes
only
to
this
stew
in
your
own
juice
and
wait
indeed
he
is
right
if
i
had
come
to
the
point
i
should
not
have
gone
to
him
to
chatter
but
really
to
confess
what
is
strange
is
that
he
does
not
at
all
seem
to
think
he
will
have
to
put
me
through
the
and
to
whom
does
he
mean
me
to
go
to
the
first
comer
who
will
wind
about
me
his
spool
of
commonplaces
and
stroke
me
with
his
big
hands
without
seeing
clearly
well
well
what
is
the
time
he
looked
at
his
watch
six
and
i
do
not
care
to
go
home
what
shall
i
do
till
dinner
he
was
near
sulpice
he
went
in
and
sat
down
to
clear
his
thoughts
a
little
taking
a
place
in
the
chapel
of
our
lady
which
at
that
hour
was
almost
empty
he
felt
no
wish
to
pray
and
rested
there
looking
at
the
great
arch
of
marble
and
gold
like
a
scene
in
a
theatre
where
the
virgin
the
only
figure
in
the
light
advances
towards
the
faithful
as
from
a
decorated
grotto
on
plaster
clouds
meanwhile
two
little
sisters
of
the
poor
came
and
knelt
not
far
from
him
and
meditated
their
heads
between
their
hands
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
them
those
souls
are
to
be
envied
who
can
thus
be
abstracted
in
prayer
how
do
they
manage
it
for
in
fact
it
is
not
easy
if
one
thinks
of
the
sorrows
of
the
world
to
praise
the
vaunted
mercy
of
god
it
is
all
very
fine
to
believe
that
he
exists
to
be
certain
that
he
is
good
in
fact
we
do
not
know
him
we
are
ignorant
of
him
he
is
and
in
fact
he
can
only
be
immanent
permanent
and
inaccessible
he
is
we
know
not
what
and
at
most
we
know
what
he
is
not
try
to
imagine
him
and
the
senses
fail
for
he
is
above
about
and
in
each
one
of
us
he
is
three
and
he
is
one
he
is
each
and
he
is
all
he
is
without
beginning
and
he
will
be
without
end
he
is
above
all
and
for
ever
incomprehensible
if
we
try
to
picture
him
to
ourselves
and
give
him
a
human
wrappage
we
come
back
to
the
simple
conception
of
the
early
times
we
represent
him
under
the
features
of
an
ancestor
some
old
italian
model
some
old
father
tourgéneff
with
a
long
beard
and
we
can
not
but
smile
so
childish
is
the
likeness
of
god
the
father
he
is
in
fact
so
absolutely
above
the
imagination
and
the
senses
that
he
comes
only
nominally
into
prayer
and
the
impulses
of
humanity
ascend
especially
to
the
son
who
only
can
be
addressed
because
he
became
man
and
is
to
us
somewhat
of
an
elder
brother
because
having
wept
in
human
form
we
think
he
will
hear
us
more
readily
and
be
more
compassionate
to
our
sorrows
as
to
the
third
person
he
is
even
more
disconcerting
than
the
first
he
is
especially
the
unknowable
how
can
we
imagine
this
god
formless
and
bodiless
this
substance
equal
to
the
two
others
who
as
it
were
breathe
him
forth
we
think
of
him
as
a
brightness
a
fluid
a
breath
we
can
not
even
lend
to
him
as
to
the
father
the
face
of
a
man
since
on
the
two
occasions
that
he
took
to
himself
a
body
he
showed
himself
under
the
likenesses
of
a
dove
and
of
tongues
of
fire
and
these
two
different
aspects
do
not
help
to
a
suggestion
of
the
new
appearance
he
might
assume
certainly
the
trinity
is
terrible
and
makes
the
brain
reel
ruysbröck
has
moreover
said
admirably
those
who
would
know
and
study
what
god
is
know
that
it
is
forbidden
they
will
go
mad
so
he
continued
looking
at
the
two
little
sisters
who
were
now
telling
their
beads
these
good
women
are
right
not
to
try
to
understand
and
to
confine
themselves
to
praying
with
all
their
heart
to
the
mother
and
the
son
moreover
in
all
the
lives
of
the
saints
which
they
have
read
they
have
made
certain
that
jesus
and
mary
always
appeared
to
the
elect
to
console
and
strengthen
them
in
fact
how
stupid
i
am
to
pray
to
the
son
is
to
pray
to
the
two
others
for
in
praying
to
one
among
them
i
pray
at
the
same
time
to
the
three
since
the
three
make
but
one
and
the
substances
are
however
special
because
if
the
divine
essence
is
one
and
simple
it
is
so
in
the
threefold
distinction
of
the
persons
but
again
what
is
the
use
of
fathoming
the
impenetrable
yet
he
continued
remembering
the
interview
he
had
just
had
with
the
priest
how
will
all
this
end
if
the
abbé
be
right
i
no
longer
belong
to
myself
i
am
about
to
enter
the
unknown
which
frightens
me
if
only
the
sound
of
my
vices
consents
to
be
silent
but
i
feel
that
they
rise
furiously
within
me
ah
that
florence
and
he
thought
of
a
woman
to
whose
vagaries
he
was
riveted
continues
to
walk
about
in
my
brain
i
see
her
behind
the
lowered
curtain
of
my
eyes
and
when
i
think
of
her
i
am
a
terrible
coward
he
endeavoured
once
more
to
put
her
away
but
his
will
was
overcome
at
the
sight
of
her
he
hated
despised
and
even
cursed
her
but
the
madness
of
his
illusions
excited
him
he
left
her
disgusted
with
her
and
with
himself
he
swore
he
would
never
see
her
again
but
did
not
keep
his
resolve
he
saw
her
now
in
vision
extend
her
hand
to
him
he
recoiled
struggling
to
free
himself
but
his
dream
continued
mingling
her
with
the
form
of
one
of
the
sisters
whose
gentle
profile
he
saw
suddenly
he
started
returned
to
the
real
world
and
saw
that
he
was
at
sulpice
in
the
chapel
it
is
disgusting
that
i
should
come
here
to
soil
the
church
with
my
horrible
dreams
i
had
better
go
he
went
out
in
confusion
thinking
perhaps
if
i
visit
florence
once
again
i
may
perhaps
put
an
end
to
this
haunting
sense
of
her
presence
seeing
and
knowing
the
reality
and
he
was
obliged
to
answer
himself
that
he
was
becoming
idiotic
for
he
knew
by
experience
that
past
desire
grows
in
proportion
as
it
is
nourished
no
the
abbé
was
right
i
have
to
become
and
to
remain
penitent
but
how
pray
how
can
i
pray
when
evil
imaginations
pursue
me
even
in
church
evil
dreams
followed
me
to
la
glacière
here
they
appear
again
and
smite
me
to
the
ground
how
can
i
defend
myself
for
indeed
it
is
frightful
to
be
thus
alone
to
know
nothing
and
have
no
proof
to
feel
the
prayers
which
one
tears
out
of
oneself
fall
into
the
silence
and
the
void
without
a
gesture
to
answer
without
a
word
of
encouragement
without
a
sign
i
do
not
even
know
if
he
be
there
and
if
he
listens
the
abbé
tells
me
to
wait
an
indication
an
order
from
on
high
but
alas
they
come
to
me
from
below
chapter
vi
many
months
passed
durtal
continued
his
alternation
of
wanton
and
pious
ideas
without
power
to
resist
he
saw
himself
slipping
all
this
is
far
from
clear
he
cried
one
day
in
a
rage
when
less
apathetic
than
usual
he
forced
himself
to
take
stock
now
monsieur
what
does
this
mean
whenever
my
sensual
obsessions
are
weaker
so
also
are
my
religious
impressions
that
means
said
the
priest
that
your
adversary
is
holding
out
to
you
the
most
treacherous
of
his
baits
he
seeks
to
persuade
you
that
you
will
never
attain
to
anything
unless
you
will
give
yourself
up
to
the
most
repugnant
excesses
he
tries
to
convince
you
that
satiety
and
disgust
of
these
acts
alone
will
bring
you
back
to
god
he
incites
you
to
commit
them
that
they
may
so
to
speak
bring
about
your
deliverance
he
leads
you
into
sin
under
pretext
of
delivering
you
from
it
have
a
little
energy
despise
these
sophistries
and
resist
him
he
went
to
see
the
abbé
gévresin
every
week
he
liked
the
patient
discretion
of
the
old
priest
who
let
him
talk
when
he
was
in
a
confidential
humour
listened
to
him
carefully
manifested
no
surprise
at
his
frequent
temptations
and
his
falls
only
the
abbé
always
returned
to
his
first
advice
insisted
on
regular
prayer
and
that
durtal
should
each
day
if
possible
visit
a
church
he
also
now
said
the
hour
is
important
for
the
success
of
these
practices
if
you
wish
that
the
chapels
should
be
favourable
to
you
get
up
in
time
to
be
present
at
daybreak
at
the
first
mass
the
servants
mass
and
also
be
very
often
in
the
sanctuaries
at
nightfall
the
priest
had
evidently
formed
a
plan
durtal
did
not
yet
wholly
understand
it
but
he
was
bound
to
admit
that
this
discipline
of
temporizing
this
constant
call
to
thought
always
directed
to
god
by
his
daily
visits
to
the
churches
acted
upon
him
at
last
and
little
by
little
softened
his
soul
one
fact
proved
it
that
he
who
for
so
long
a
time
had
been
unable
to
meditate
in
the
morning
now
prayed
as
soon
as
he
awoke
even
in
the
afternoon
he
found
himself
on
some
days
seized
with
the
need
of
speaking
humbly
with
god
with
an
irresistible
desire
to
ask
his
pardon
and
implore
his
help
it
seemed
then
that
the
lord
knocked
at
his
door
with
gentle
touches
wishing
so
to
recall
his
attention
and
draw
him
to
him
but
when
softened
and
troubled
durtal
would
enter
into
himself
to
seek
god
he
wandered
vaguely
not
knowing
what
he
said
and
thinking
of
other
things
while
speaking
to
him
he
complained
of
these
wanderings
and
distractions
to
the
priest
who
answered
you
are
on
the
threshold
of
the
probationary
life
you
can
not
yet
experience
the
sweet
and
familiar
friendship
of
prayer
do
not
sadden
yourself
because
you
can
not
close
behind
you
the
gate
of
your
senses
watch
and
wait
pray
badly
if
you
can
do
nothing
else
but
pray
all
the
same
be
very
sure
too
that
every
one
has
experienced
the
troubles
which
distress
you
above
all
believe
that
we
do
not
walk
blindfold
that
mysticism
is
an
absolutely
exact
science
it
can
foretell
the
greater
part
of
the
phenomena
which
occur
in
that
soul
which
the
lord
intends
for
a
perfect
life
it
follows
also
spiritual
operations
with
the
same
clearness
as
physiology
observes
the
different
states
of
the
body
for
ages
and
ages
it
has
disclosed
the
progress
of
grace
and
its
effects
now
impetuous
and
now
slow
it
has
even
pointed
out
the
modifications
of
material
organs
which
are
transformed
when
the
soul
entirely
loses
itself

found
at
last
an
admirable
psychologist
to
sum
up
its
rules
and
their
exceptions
a
saint

has
verified
in
her
own
person
the
supernatural
phases

has
described
a
woman
whose
lucidity
was
more
than
human
saint
teresa
you
have
read
her
life
and
her
of
the
soul
durtal
nodded
assent
then
you
have
your
information
you
ought
to
know
that
before
reaching
the
shores
of
blessedness
before
arriving
at
the
fifth
dwelling
of
the
interior
castle
at
that
prayer
of
union
wherein
the
soul
is
awakened
in
regard
to
god
and
completely
asleep
to
all
things
of
earth
and
to
herself
she
must
pass
through
lamentable
states
of
dryness
and
the
most
painful
strainings
take
heart
therefore
say
to
yourself
that
this
dryness
should
be
a
source
of
humility
and
not
a
cause
of
disquietude
do
in
fact
as
saint
teresa
would
have
you
carry
your
cross
and
not
drag
it
after
you
that
magnificent
and
terrible
saint
frightens
me
sighed
durtal
i
have
read
her
works
and
do
you
know
she
gives
me
the
idea
of
a
stainless
lily
but
a
metallic
lily
forged
of
wrought
iron
you
will
admit
that
those
who
suffer
have
scant
consolations
to
expect
from
her
yes
in
the
sense
that
she
does
not
think
of
the
creature
except
in
the
way
of
mysticism
she
supposes
the
fields
already
ploughed
the
soul
already
freed
from
its
more
vehement
temptations
and
sheltered
from
crises
her
is
as
yet
too
high
and
too
distant
for
you
for
in
fact
she
is
addressing
nuns
women
of
the
cloister
beings
who
live
apart
from
the
world
and
who
are
consequently
already
advanced
on
those
ascetic
ways
wherein
god
is
leading
them
but
make
an
effort
in
the
spirit
to
free
yourself
from
this
mud
cast
away
for
a
few
moments
the
memory
of
your
imperfections
and
your
troubles
and
follow
her
see
then
how
experienced
she
is
in
the
domain
of
the
supernatural
how
in
spite
of
her
repetitions
and
tediousness
she
explains
wisely
and
clearly
the
mechanism
of
the
soul
unfolding
when
god
touches
it
in
subjects
where
words
fail
and
phrases
crumble
away
she
succeeds
in
making
herself
understood
in
showing
making
felt
almost
making
visible
the
inconceivable
sight
of
god
buried
in
the
soul
and
taking
his
pleasure
there
and
she
goes
still
further
into
the
mystery
even
to
the
end
bounds
with
a
final
spring
to
the
very
gates
of
heaven
but
then
she
faints
on
adoration
and
being
unable
to
express
herself
further
she
soars
describing
circles
like
a
frightened
bird
wandering
beyond
herself
in
cries
of
love
yes
monsieur
i
recognize
that
saint
teresa
has
explored
deeper
than
any
other
the
unknown
regions
of
the
soul
she
is
in
some
measure
its
geographer
has
drawn
the
map
of
its
poles
marked
the
latitudes
of
contemplation
the
interior
lands
of
the
human
sky
other
saints
have
explored
them
before
her
but
they
have
not
left
us
so
methodical
nor
so
exact
a
topography
but
in
spite
of
this
i
prefer
those
mystical
writers
who
have
less
and
discuss
less
who
always
do
throughout
their
works
what
saint
teresa
did
at
the
end
of
hers
that
is
who
are
all
on
fire
from
the
first
page
to
the
last
and
are
consumed
and
lost
at
the
feet
of
christ
ruysbröck
is
among
these
the
little
volume
which
hello
has
translated
is
a
very
furnace
and
again
to
quote
a
woman
take
saint
angela
of
foligno
not
so
much
in
the
book
of
her
visions
which
may
not
be
always
effectual
as
in
the
wonderful
life
which
she
dictated
to
brother
armand
her
confessor
she
too
explains
and
much
earlier
than
saint
teresa
the
principles
and
effects
of
mysticism
but
if
she
is
less
profound
less
clever
in
defining
shades
on
the
other
hand
she
is
wonderfully
effusive
and
tender
she
caresses
the
soul
she
is
a
bacchante
of
divine
love
a
mænad
of
purity
christ
loves
her
holds
long
conversations
with
her
the
words
she
has
retained
surpass
all
literature
and
are
manifestly
the
most
beautiful
ever
written
this
is
no
longer
the
rough
christ
the
spanish
christ
who
begins
by
trampling
on
his
creature
to
make
him
more
supple
he
is
the
merciful
christ
of
the
gospels
the
gentle
christ
of
saint
francis
and
i
like
the
christ
of
the
franciscans
better
than
the
christ
of
the
carmelites
what
will
you
say
then
said
the
abbé
with
a
smile
of
john
of
the
cross
you
compared
saint
teresa
just
now
to
a
flower
in
wrought
iron
he
too
is
such
but
he
is
the
lily
of
tortures
the
royal
flower
which
the
executioners
were
wont
of
old
time
to
stamp
on
the
heraldic
flesh
of
convicts
like
iron
he
is
at
the
same
time
burning
and
sombre
as
you
turn
over
the
pages
saint
teresa
now
and
then
bends
over
and
sorrows
and
compassionates
us
he
remains
impenetrable
buried
in
his
internal
abyss
occupied
above
all
things
in
describing
the
sufferings
of
the
soul
which
after
having
crucified
its
desires
passes
through
the
obscure
that
is
to
say
through
the
renunciation
of
all
which
comes
from
the
sensible
and
the
created
he
wills
that
we
should
extinguish
our
imagination
so
lethargize
it
that
it
can
no
longer
form
images
imprison
our
senses
annihilate
our
faculties
he
wills
that
he
who
desires
to
unite
himself
to
god
should
place
himself
under
an
exhausted
receiver
and
make
a
vacuum
within
so
that
if
he
choose
the
pilgrim
should
descend
therein
and
purify
himself
tearing
out
the
remains
of
sins
extirpating
the
last
relics
of
vice
then
the
sufferings
which
the
soul
endures
overpass
the
bounds
of
the
possible
it
lies
lost
in
utter
darkness
falls
under
discouragement
and
fatigue
believes
itself
for
ever
abandoned
by
him
to
whom
it
cries
who
now
hides
himself
and
answers
not
again
happy
still
when
in
that
agony
the
pangs
of
the
flesh
are
not
added
and
that
abominable
spirit
which
isaias
calls
the
spirit
of
confusion
and
which
is
none
other
than
the
disease
of
scrupulousness
pushed
to
its
extreme
saint
john
makes
you
shudder
when
he
cries
out
that
this
night
of
the
soul
is
bitter
and
terrible
and
that
the
being
who
suffers
it
is
plunged
alive
into
hell
but
when
the
old
man
is
purged
out
when
he
is
scraped
at
every
seam
raked
over
every
face
light
springs
out
and
god
appears
then
the
soul
casts
itself
like
a
child
into
his
arms
and
the
incomprehensible
fusion
takes
place
you
see
saint
john
penetrates
more
deeply
than
others
into
the
depths
of
mystical
initiation
he
also
like
saint
teresa
and
ruysbröck
treats
of
the
spiritual
marriage
of
the
influx
of
grace
and
its
gifts
but
he
first
dared
to
describe
minutely
the
dolorous
phases
which
till
then
had
been
but
hinted
at
with
trembling
then
if
he
is
an
admirable
theologian
he
is
also
a
rigorous
and
saint
he
has
not
those
weaknesses
which
are
natural
to
a
woman
he
does
not
lose
himself
in
digressions
nor
return
continually
on
his
own
steps
he
walks
straight
forward
but
you
often
see
him
at
the
end
of
the
road
and
terrible
with
dry
eyes
but
but
said
durtal
surely
not
all
souls
whom
christ
will
lead
in
the
ways
of
mysticism
are
tried
thus
yes
almost
always
more
or
less
i
will
confess
that
i
thought
the
spiritual
life
was
less
arid
and
less
complex
i
imagined
that
by
leading
a
pure
life
praying
one
best
and
communicating
one
would
attain
without
much
trouble
not
indeed
to
taste
the
infinite
joys
reserved
for
the
saints
but
at
last
to
possess
the
lord
and
live
at
least
near
him
at
rest
and
i
should
be
quite
content
with
this
middle
class
joy
the
price
paid
in
advance
for
the
exaltation
described
by
saint
john
disconcerts
me
the
abbé
smiled
but
made
no
answer
but
do
you
know
that
if
it
be
so
replied
durtal
we
are
very
far
from
the
catholicism
that
is
taught
us
it
is
so
practical
so
benign
so
gentle
in
comparison
with
mysticism
it
is
made
for
lukewarm
souls
that
is
to
say
for
almost
all
the
pious
souls
which
are
about
us
it
lives
in
a
moderate
atmosphere
without
too
great
suffering
or
too
much
joy
it
only
can
be
assimilated
by
the
masses
and
the
priests
are
right
to
present
it
thus
since
otherwise
the
faithful
would
cease
to
understand
it
or
would
take
flight
in
alarm
but
if
god
judge
that
a
moderate
religion
is
amply
sufficient
for
the
masses
believe
that
he
demands
the
most
painful
efforts
on
the
part
of
those
whom
he
deigns
to
initiate
into
the
supremely
adorable
mysteries
of
his
person
it
is
necessary
and
just
that
he
should
mortify
them
before
allowing
them
to
taste
the
essential
intoxication
of
union
with
him
in
fact
the
end
of
mysticism
is
to
render
visible
sensible
almost
palpable
the
god
who
remains
silent
and
hidden
from
all
and
to
throw
us
into
his
deep
into
the
silent
abyss
of
joy
but
in
order
to
speak
correctly
we
must
forget
the
ordinary
use
of
expressions
which
have
been
degraded
in
order
to
describe
this
mysterious
love
we
are
obliged
to
draw
our
comparisons
from
human
acts
and
to
inflict
on
the
lord
the
shame
of
our
words
we
have
to
employ
such
terms
as
feast
but
it
is
impossible
to
speak
of
the
inexpressible
and
with
the
baseness
of
our
language
declare
the
ineffable
immersion
of
the
soul
in
god
the
fact
is
murmured
durtal
but
to
return
to
saint
teresa
she
too
interrupted
the
abbé
has
treated
of
this
which
terrifies
you
but
she
only
speaks
of
it
in
a
few
lines
she
calls
it
the
soul
agony
a
sadness
so
bitter
that
she
strove
in
vain
to
depict
it
no
doubt
but
i
prefer
her
to
saint
john
of
the
cross
for
she
is
not
so
discouraging
as
that
inflexible
saint
admit
that
he
belongs
too
much
to
the
land
of
those
large
christs
who
bleed
in
caverns
of
what
nationality
then
was
saint
teresa
yes
i
know
she
was
a
spaniard
but
so
complex
so
strange
that
race
seems
obliterated
in
her
less
clearly
defined
it
is
clear
she
was
an
admirable
psychologist
but
also
how
strange
is
in
her
the
mixture
of
an
ardent
mystic
and
a
cool
woman
of
business
for
in
fact
she
has
a
double
nature
she
is
a
contemplative
outside
the
world
and
at
the
same
time
a
statesman
a
female
colbert
of
the
cloister
in
fact
never
was
woman
so
consummate
a
skilled
artisan
and
so
powerful
an
organizer
when
we
consider
that
in
spite
of
incredible
difficulties
she
founded
nunneries
that
she
put
them
all
under
obedience
to
a
rule
which
is
a
model
of
wisdom
a
rule
which
foresees
and
rectifies
the
most
ignored
mistakes
of
the
heart
it
is
astonishing
to
hear
her
treated
by
people
as
an
hysterical
madwoman
one
of
the
distinctive
marks
of
the
mystics
answered
the
abbé
with
a
smile
is
just
their
absolute
balance
their
entire
common
sense
these
conversations
cheered
durtal
they
planted
on
him
seeds
of
reflection
which
sprang
up
when
he
was
alone
they
encouraged
him
to
trust
to
the
advice
of
this
priest
and
follow
his
counsels
he
found
himself
all
the
better
for
this
conduct
in
that
his
visits
to
the
churches
his
prayers
and
readings
occupied
his
objectless
life
and
he
was
no
longer
wearied
i
have
at
least
gained
peaceable
evenings
and
quiet
nights
he
said
to
himself
he
knew
the
soothing
help
of
a
pious
evening
he
visited
sulpice
at
those
times
when
under
the
dull
gleam
of
the
lamps
the
pillars
opened
out
and
threw
long
panels
of
darkness
on
the
ground
the
chapels
which
remained
open
were
in
shade
and
in
the
nave
before
the
high
altar
a
single
cluster
of
lamps
above
in
the
darkness
shone
out
like
a
luminous
bunch
of
red
roses
in
the
stillness
no
sounds
were
heard
but
the
dull
thud
of
a
door
the
creaking
of
a
chair
the
short
paces
of
a
woman
the
hurried
stride
of
a
man
durtal
was
almost
isolated
in
the
obscure
chapel
which
he
had
chosen
he
kept
himself
there
so
far
from
all
so
far
from
the
city
whose
full
pulse
was
beating
only
two
paces
from
him
he
knelt
down
and
remained
still
he
prepared
to
speak
and
had
nothing
to
say
felt
himself
carried
away
by
an
impulse
but
no
words
came
he
ended
by
falling
into
a
vague
languor
experiencing
that
indolent
ease
that
dim
sense
of
comfort
which
the
body
feels
in
a
medicated
bath
he
fell
of
the
lot
of
the
women
who
were
round
about
him
here
and
there
in
chairs
ah
those
poor
little
black
shawls
those
miserable
pleated
caps
those
wretched
tippets
those
doleful
seed
rosaries
they
fingered
in
the
shade
some
in
mourning
sobbed
still
inconsolable
others
overwhelmed
bent
their
backs
and
hung
their
heads
on
one
side
others
prayed
their
shoulders
shaking
their
head
in
their
hands
the
task
of
the
day
was
over
those
wearied
of
their
life
came
to
ask
for
mercy
everywhere
misfortune
was
kneeling
for
the
rich
the
healthy
the
happy
hardly
pray
all
around
in
the
church
were
women
widowed
or
old
without
love
women
deserted
women
whose
home
was
a
torture
praying
that
existence
might
become
more
merciful
that
the
dissoluteness
of
their
husbands
might
cease
the
vices
of
their
sons
amend
the
health
of
those
they
loved
grow
stronger
a
lamentable
perfume
went
up
like
incense
to
our
lady
from
a
very
sheaf
of
woes
few
men
came
to
this
hidden
of
trouble
still
fewer
young
people
for
these
have
not
yet
suffered
enough
there
were
only
a
few
old
men
and
a
few
sick
who
dragged
themselves
along
by
the
backs
of
the
chairs
and
a
little
hunchback
whom
durtal
saw
coming
there
every
evening
an
outcast
who
could
only
be
loved
by
her
who
does
not
even
see
the
body
a
burning
pity
seized
on
durtal
at
the
sight
of
those
unhappy
ones
who
came
to
beg
from
heaven
a
little
of
the
love
refused
them
by
men
and
he
who
could
not
pray
on
his
own
account
ended
by
joining
himself
to
their
pleadings
and
praying
for
them
so
indifferent
in
the
afternoon
the
churches
were
truly
persuasive
truly
sweet
in
the
evening
they
seemed
to
bestir
themselves
at
nightfall
and
to
compassionate
in
their
solitude
the
sufferings
of
those
sick
creatures
whose
complaints
they
heard
and
their
first
mass
in
the
morning
the
mass
of
working
women
and
servant
maids
was
no
less
touching
there
were
there
no
bigots
nor
curious
persons
but
poor
women
who
came
to
seek
in
communion
strength
to
live
their
hours
of
onerous
tasks
and
servile
needs
they
knew
as
they
left
the
church
that
they
were
the
living
custodians
of
a
god
of
him
who
was
ever
while
on
earth
the
poor
man
who
took
pleasure
only
in
souls
who
had
scarce
where
to
lay
their
head
they
knew
themselves
his
chosen
and
did
not
doubt
that
when
he
entrusted
to
them
under
the
form
of
bread
the
memorial
of
his
suffering
he
demanded
of
them
in
exchange
that
they
should
live
in
sorrow
and
humility
and
what
harm
then
could
do
to
them
the
cares
of
a
day
spent
in
the
salutary
shame
of
base
occupations
i
now
understand
thought
durtal
why
the
abbé
made
such
a
point
of
my
seeing
the
churches
early
or
late
those
are
in
fact
the
only
times
in
which
the
soul
expands
but
he
was
too
idle
to
be
often
present
at
early
mass
he
was
content
to
take
his
relaxation
after
dinner
in
the
chapels
he
came
out
with
a
feeling
of
peace
even
if
he
had
prayed
badly
or
not
prayed
at
all
on
other
evenings
on
the
contrary
he
felt
tired
of
solitude
tired
of
silence
tired
of
darkness
and
then
he
abandoned
sulpice
and
went
to
notre
dame
des
victoires
in
this
sanctuary
there
was
no
longer
that
depression
that
despair
of
poor
wretches
who
dragged
themselves
to
the
nearest
church
and
sat
down
in
the
shade
the
pilgrims
to
notre
dame
des
victoires
brought
a
surer
confidence
and
that
faith
softened
their
sorrows
whose
bitterness
was
dissipated
in
the
explosions
of
hope
the
stammering
adoration
which
spouted
up
all
around
there
were
two
currents
in
that
refuge
that
of
people
who
asked
for
favours
and
that
of
those
who
having
gained
them
were
profuse
in
thankfulness
and
in
acts
of
gratitude
therefore
that
church
had
its
especial
physiognomy
more
joyous
than
sad
less
melancholy
more
ardent
under
all
circumstances
than
that
of
other
churches
it
had
moreover
the
peculiarity
of
being
much
frequented
by
men
but
less
by
hypocrites
who
will
not
look
you
in
the
face
or
with
upturned
eyes
than
by
men
of
all
classes
whose
features
were
not
degraded
by
false
piety
there
alone
were
to
be
seen
clear
expressions
and
clean
faces
there
above
all
was
not
that
horrible
grimace
of
the
working
man
of
the
catholic
clubs
that
hideous
creature
in
a
blouse
whose
breath
belies
the
unction
of
his
features
in
that
church
covered
with
plastered
even
above
the
arches
with
inscriptions
on
marble
celebrating
the
joy
for
prayers
granted
and
benefits
received
before
that
altar
of
our
lady
where
hundreds
of
tapers
pierced
the
air
blue
with
incense
with
the
gilded
blades
of
their
lances
there
were
public
prayers
every
evening
at
eight
a
priest
in
the
pulpit
said
the
rosary
sometimes
the
litany
of
our
lady
was
sung
to
a
singular
air
a
sort
of
musical
cento
but
it
was
impossible
to
say
whence
it
was
constructed
very
rhythmical
and
continually
changing
its
tone
now
fast
now
slow
bringing
with
it
for
a
moment
a
vague
recollection
of
airs
then
turning
sharply
at
a
tangent
to
a
tune
a
modern
almost
vulgar
melody
yet
after
all
there
was
something
taking
in
this
singular
confusion
of
sounds
after
the
kyrie
eleison
and
the
opening
invocations
the
virgin
came
upon
the
scene
to
a
dance
measure
like
a
ballet
girl
but
when
certain
of
her
attributes
were
paraded
and
certain
of
her
symbolical
names
declared
the
music
became
singularly
respectful
it
became
lower
halting
and
solemn
thrice
repeating
on
the
same
motive
some
of
her
attributes
the
refugium
peccatorum
among
others
then
it
went
on
again
and
began
her
graces
again
with
a
skip
when
by
chance
there
was
no
sermon
the
benediction
took
place
immediately
afterwards
then
with
raspings
of
the
choir
a
bass
with
a
cold
and
two
boys
who
snivelled
began
their
liturgical
chants
inviolata
that
languishing
and
plaintive
sequence
with
its
clear
and
drawling
tune
so
weak
so
frail
that
it
would
seem
as
if
it
should
only
be
sung
by
voices
in
a
hospital
then
the
parce
domine
that
antiphon
so
suppliant
and
so
sad
lastly
that
scrap
detached
from
the
panga
lingua
the
tantum
ergo
humble
and
thoughtful
attentive
and
slow
when
the
organ
sounded
out
the
first
chords
and
that
plain
chant
melody
began
the
choir
had
only
to
cross
their
arms
and
hold
their
tongues
as
tapers
which
are
lighted
by
threads
of
fulminate
attached
one
to
the
other
the
faithful
caught
fire
and
accompanied
by
the
organs
struck
up
for
themselves
the
humble
and
glorious
strains
they
were
then
kneeling
on
the
chairs
prostrate
on
the
pavement
and
when
after
the
exchange
of
antiphons
and
responses
after
the
oremus
the
priest
ascended
to
the
altar
his
shoulders
and
hands
enfolded
in
the
white
silk
scarf
to
take
the
monstrance
then
at
the
shrill
and
hurried
sounds
of
the
bells
a
wind
passed
which
at
once
bent
every
head
like
the
mowing
of
grass
in
these
groups
of
souls
on
fire
there
was
a
fulness
of
devotion
a
complete
and
absolute
silence
till
the
bells
again
rang
out
and
invited
human
life
which
had
been
interrupted
to
wrap
itself
in
a
great
sign
of
the
cross
and
resume
its
course
the
laudate
was
not
ended
when
durtal
left
the
church
before
the
crowd
began
to
move
verily
he
said
as
he
entered
his
lodgings
the
fervour
of
that
congregation
who
do
not
come
as
in
other
churches
from
the
districts
but
are
pilgrims
from
everywhere
and
one
knows
not
where
is
out
of
tune
with
the
blackguardism
of
this
foolish
age
then
at
notre
dame
at
least
one
hears
curious
singing
and
he
bethought
him
of
those
strange
litanies
which
he
had
heard
nowhere
else
and
yet
he
had
experienced
all
kinds
in
churches
at
sulpice
for
example
it
was
recited
to
two
tunes
when
the
choir
sang
it
was
set
to
a
plain
chant
melody
bellowed
by
the
gong
of
a
bass
to
which
the
sharp
fife
of
the
boys
made
answer
but
during
rosary
month
on
every
day
except
thursday
the
task
of
singing
it
was
entrusted
to
young
ladies
then
in
the
evening
round
a
wheezy
old
harmonium
a
troup
of
young
and
old
geese
made
our
lady
run
round
on
her
litanies
as
on
hobby
horses
to
the
music
of
a
fair
in
other
churches
at
thomas
aquinas
for
example
where
they
were
also
dropped
out
by
women
the
litanies
were
sprinkled
with
powder
and
perfumed
by
bergamot
and
ambergris
they
were
in
fact
adapted
to
a
minuet
tune
and
therefore
did
not
disagree
with
the
operatic
architecture
of
the
church
where
they
presented
a
virgin
walking
with
mincing
steps
pinching
her
petticoat
with
two
fingers
bending
in
beautiful
curtseys
and
recovering
herself
with
a
fine
bow
this
has
evidently
nothing
to
do
with
church
music
but
it
was
none
the
less
disagreeable
to
hear
it
would
have
made
the
whole
performance
complete
if
the
harpsichord
had
been
substituted
for
the
organ
far
more
interesting
than
this
lay
quavering
was
the
plain
chant
given
more
or
less
badly
as
it
was
moreover
given
but
yet
given
when
there
was
no
special
ceremony
at
notre
dame
it
was
not
arranged
there
as
at
sulpice
and
the
other
churches
where
the
tantum
ergo
is
almost
always
dressed
up
in
foolish
flourishes
tunes
for
military
ceremonials
or
public
dinners
the
church
has
not
allowed
the
actual
text
of
saint
thomas
aquinas
to
be
altered
but
she
has
let
any
and
every
choirmaster
suppress
the
plain
chant
in
which
it
has
been
wrapped
from
its
birth
which
has
penetrated
to
its
marrow
has
clung
to
each
of
its
phrases
and
become
with
it
one
body
and
one
soul
it
was
monstrous
and
it
must
really
be
that
these
curés
have
lost
not
the
sense
of
art
for
that
they
never
had
but
the
most
elementary
sense
of
the
liturgy
to
accept
such
heresies
and
tolerate
such
outrages
in
their
churches
these
thoughts
enraged
durtal
but
he
returned
little
by
little
to
notre
dame
des
victoires
and
grew
calmer
it
was
well
he
should
examine
it
under
all
aspects
but
it
remained
none
the
less
mysterious
nor
the
less
unique
in
paris
at
la
salette
at
lourdes
there
have
been
apparitions
whether
these
have
been
authentic
or
controverted
matters
little
he
thought
for
even
supposing
our
lady
were
not
there
at
the
moment
her
coming
was
announced
she
was
attracted
there
and
dwells
there
now
retained
there
by
the
tide
of
prayer
and
the
emanations
cast
up
by
the
faith
of
crowds
miracles
have
happened
there
it
is
therefore
not
astonishing
that
pious
crowds
flock
thither
but
here
at
notre
dame
des
victoires
has
been
no
apparition
no
mélanie
no
bernadette
have
seen
and
described
the
luminous
appearance
of
a
lady
there
are
no
piscinas
no
medical
staff
no
public
cures
no
mountain
top
no
grotto
nothing
one
fine
day
in
the
curé
of
the
parish
the
abbé
dufriche
des
genettes
declared
that
while
he
was
celebrating
mass
our
lady
manifested
to
him
her
desire
that
the
sanctuary
should
be
specially
consecrated
to
her
and
that
alone
was
enough
the
church
then
a
desert
has
never
since
been
empty
and
thousands
of
declare
the
graces
which
since
that
day
the
madonna
has
accorded
to
the
visitors
yes
but
in
fact
concluded
durtal
all
these
suppliants
are
not
specially
extraordinary
souls
for
indeed
the
most
part
of
them
are
like
me
they
come
in
their
own
interests
for
themselves
and
not
for
her
and
he
remembered
the
answer
of
the
abbé
gévresin
to
whom
he
had
already
made
the
observation
you
must
be
singularly
far
advanced
on
the
road
to
perfection
if
you
go
there
for
her
only
suddenly
after
so
many
hours
spent
in
the
chapels
there
was
a
reaction
the
flesh
extinguished
under
the
cinders
of
prayers
took
fire
and
the
conflagration
springing
up
from
below
became
terrible
florence
seemed
present
to
durtal
imagination
at
his
lodgings
in
the
churches
in
the
street
everywhere
and
he
was
constantly
on
the
watch
against
her
recurrent
attractions
the
weather
was
mixed
up
with
it
all
the
heaven
broke
up
a
stormy
summer
raged
shattering
the
nerves
enfeebling
the
will
letting
the
awakened
troop
of
vices
loose
in
their
gloomy
moisture
durtal
blenched
before
the
dread
of
long
evenings
and
the
abominable
melancholy
of
days
that
never
ended
at
eight
in
the
evening
the
sun
had
not
set
and
at
three
in
the
morning
it
seemed
to
wake
again
the
week
was
only
one
uninterrupted
day
and
life
was
never
arrested
oppressed
by
the
ignominy
of
this
angry
sunshine
and
these
blue
skies
disgusted
at
bathing
in
niles
of
sweat
and
feeling
niagaras
run
from
his
hat
he
did
not
stir
from
home
and
then
in
his
solitude
foul
thoughts
assailed
him
it
was
an
obsession
by
thought
by
vision
in
all
ways
and
the
haunting
was
all
the
more
terrible
that
it
was
so
special
that
it
never
turned
aside
but
concentrated
itself
always
on
the
same
point
the
face
and
figure
of
florence
durtal
resisted
then
in
distraction
took
to
flight
tried
to
tire
himself
out
by
long
walks
and
to
divert
his
mind
by
excursions
but
the
ignoble
desire
followed
him
in
his
course
sat
before
him
in
the
café
came
between
his
eyes
and
the
newspaper
he
strove
to
read
becoming
ever
more
definite
he
ended
after
hours
of
struggle
by
giving
way
and
going
to
see
this
woman
he
left
her
overwhelmed
half
dead
with
disgust
and
shame
almost
in
tears
nor
did
he
thus
find
any
solace
in
his
struggle
but
the
contrary
far
from
escaping
it
the
hateful
charm
took
more
violent
and
tenacious
possession
of
him
then
durtal
thought
of
and
accepted
a
strange
compromise
to
visit
another
woman
he
knew
and
in
her
society
to
break
this
nervous
state
to
put
an
end
to
this
possession
this
weariness
and
remorse
and
in
doing
so
he
strove
to
persuade
himself
that
in
thus
acting
he
would
be
more
pardonable
less
sinful
the
clearest
result
of
this
attempt
was
to
bring
back
the
memory
of
florence
and
her
vicious
charm
he
continued
therefore
his
intimacy
with
her
and
then
he
had
during
a
few
days
such
a
revolt
from
his
slavery
that
he
extricated
himself
from
the
sewer
and
stood
on
firm
ground
he
succeeded
in
recovering
and
pulling
himself
together
and
he
loathed
himself
during
this
crisis
he
had
somewhat
neglected
the
abbé
gévresin
to
whom
he
dared
not
avow
his
foulness
but
since
certain
indications
warned
him
of
new
attacks
he
took
fright
and
went
to
see
him
he
explained
his
crises
in
veiled
words
and
he
felt
so
unnerved
so
sad
that
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
well
are
you
now
certain
that
you
have
that
repentance
which
you
assure
me
you
have
not
experienced
up
to
this
time
yes
but
what
is
the
good
of
it
if
one
is
so
weak
that
in
spite
of
all
efforts
one
is
certain
to
be
overthrown
at
the
first
assault
that
is
another
question
come
i
see
that
at
present
you
are
in
fact
in
a
state
of
fatigue
requiring
help
comfort
yourself
therefore
go
in
peace
and
sin
less
the
greater
part
of
your
temptations
will
be
remitted
you
you
can
if
you
choose
bear
the
remainder
only
take
care
if
you
fall
henceforward
you
will
be
without
excuse
and
i
do
not
answer
for
it
that
instead
of
mending
your
condition
will
not
be
aggravated
and
as
durtal
stupefied
stammered
out
you
believe
i
believe
said
the
priest
in
the
mystical
substitution
of
which
i
spoke
to
you
you
will
moreover
experience
it
in
yourself
the
saints
will
enter
into
the
lists
to
help
you
they
will
take
the
overplus
of
the
assaults
which
you
can
not
conquer
without
even
knowing
your
name
from
their
secluded
province
nunneries
of
carmelites
and
poor
clares
will
pray
for
you
on
receiving
a
letter
from
me
and
in
fact
from
that
very
day
the
most
acute
attacks
ceased
did
he
owe
that
cessation
that
truce
to
the
intercession
of
the
cloistered
orders
or
to
a
change
in
the
weather
which
then
took
place
to
the
less
heat
of
the
sun
which
gave
way
to
floods
of
rain
he
could
not
tell
but
one
thing
was
certain
his
temptations
were
less
frequent
and
he
could
bear
them
with
impunity
this
idea
of
convents
in
their
compassion
dragging
him
out
of
the
mud
in
which
he
had
stuck
and
by
their
charity
bringing
him
to
the
bank
excited
him
he
chose
to
go
to
the
avenue
de
saxe
to
pray
in
the
home
of
the
sisters
of
those
who
suffered
for
him
this
time
there
were
no
lights
no
crowds
as
on
the
morning
when
he
had
been
present
at
a
procession
no
odour
of
wax
or
incense
no
sweeping
by
of
robes
of
scarlet
and
cope
of
gold
all
was
deserted
and
dark
he
was
there
alone
in
the
sombre
and
dank
chapel
smelling
like
stagnant
water
and
without
saying
rosaries
mechanically
or
repeating
prayers
by
rote
he
fell
into
a
reverie
endeavouring
to
look
somewhat
clearly
into
his
life
and
take
stock
of
himself
and
while
he
thus
pulled
himself
together
voices
came
behind
the
grating
drew
nearer
and
nearer
passed
by
the
black
sieve
of
the
veil
and
dropped
round
the
altar
whose
form
rose
dimly
in
the
shadow
these
voices
of
the
carmelites
aided
durtal
to
probe
his
despair
deeply
seated
in
a
chair
he
said
to
himself
when
any
one
is
as
incapable
as
i
am
when
i
speak
to
him
it
is
almost
shameful
to
dare
to
pray
for
indeed
if
i
think
of
him
it
is
that
i
may
ask
for
a
little
happiness
and
that
is
foolish
in
the
immediate
shipwreck
of
human
reason
wishing
to
explain
the
terrible
enigma
of
the
meaning
of
life
one
only
idea
comes
to
the
surface
in
the
midst
of
the
wreckage
of
thoughts
which
sink
the
idea
of
an
expiation
felt
rather
than
understood
the
idea
that
the
sole
end
assigned
to
life
is
sorrow
every
one
has
a
sum
of
physical
and
moral
suffering
to
pay
and
whoever
does
not
settle
it
here
below
defrays
it
after
death
happiness
is
only
lent
and
must
be
repaid
its
very
phantoms
are
like
duties
paid
in
advance
on
a
future
succession
of
sorrows
who
knows
in
that
case
whether
anæsthetics
which
suppress
corporal
pain
do
not
bring
into
debt
those
who
use
them
who
knows
whether
chloroform
is
not
a
means
of
revolt
and
if
the
shrinking
of
the
creature
from
suffering
is
not
seditious
a
rebellion
against
the
will
of
heaven
if
this
be
so
the
arrears
of
torture
the
balance
of
distress
the
warrants
of
pain
avoided
must
accumulate
terrible
interest
above
and
justify
the
war
cry
of
saint
teresa
let
me
always
suffer
or
die
this
explains
why
in
their
trials
the
saints
rejoice
and
pray
the
lord
not
to
spare
them
for
they
know
that
the
purifying
amount
of
ills
must
be
paid
in
order
to
be
free
from
debt
after
death
to
be
just
human
nature
would
be
too
ignoble
without
pain
for
it
alone
can
raise
the
soul
while
purifying
it
but
all
that
is
nothing
less
than
consoling
he
added
what
an
accompaniment
to
these
sad
thoughts
are
the
wailing
voices
of
these
nuns
it
is
truly
frightful
he
ended
by
fleeing
and
taking
refuge
to
shake
off
his
depression
in
the
neighbouring
convent
at
the
bottom
of
the
alley
de
saxe
in
a
suburban
lane
full
of
little
cottages
with
gardens
in
front
where
serpentine
paths
of
pebbles
wound
round
tufts
of
this
was
the
convent
of
the
poor
clares
of
the
ave
maria
an
order
still
more
strict
than
that
of
the
carmelites
poorer
less
fashionable
more
humble
this
cloister
was
entered
by
a
little
door
partly
ajar
you
ascended
to
the
second
storey
without
meeting
anyone
and
found
a
little
chapel
through
whose
windows
trees
were
visible
rocking
to
the
chirping
of
riotous
sparrows
this
too
was
a
place
of
burial
but
no
longer
as
though
opposite
a
tomb
at
the
bottom
of
a
dark
cavern
but
rather
a
cemetery
where
birds
sang
in
the
sun
among
the
branches
you
might
have
thought
yourself
in
the
country
twenty
miles
from
paris
the
decoration
of
this
bright
chapel
tried
however
to
be
gloomy
it
was
like
those
wine
shops
whose
walls
are
made
to
look
like
those
of
caves
with
false
stones
painted
in
the
imitation
plaster
only
the
height
of
the
nave
manifested
the
childishness
of
the
imposture
and
declared
the
vulgarity
of
the
deception
at
the
end
was
an
altar
above
a
smooth
waxed
floor
and
on
either
side
of
it
a
grating
with
a
black
veil
according
to
the
rule
of
saint
francis
all
the
ornaments
the
crucifix
the
candlesticks
the
tabernacle
were
of
wood
no
object
was
to
be
seen
in
metal
no
flower
the
only
luxury
in
the
chapel
consisted
of
two
modern
stained
windows
one
of
which
represented
saint
francis
the
other
saint
clare
durtal
thought
the
sanctuary
airy
and
delightful
but
he
only
stayed
there
a
few
minutes
for
there
was
not
here
as
at
the
carmelites
an
absolute
solitude
a
sombre
peace
here
there
were
always
two
or
three
poor
clares
trotting
about
the
chapel
who
looked
at
him
while
they
were
arranging
the
chairs
and
seemed
surprised
at
his
presence
they
were
annoying
to
him
and
he
feared
he
was
the
same
to
them
so
much
so
that
he
went
away
but
this
short
stay
was
enough
to
efface
or
at
least
to
lessen
the
funereal
impression
of
the
neighbouring
convent
durtal
returned
home
at
once
much
appeased
and
much
disquieted
much
appeased
in
regard
to
his
temptations
much
disquieted
about
what
he
should
do
next
he
felt
rising
in
him
and
increasing
ever
more
and
more
the
desire
to
have
done
with
these
strifes
and
fears
but
he
grew
pale
when
he
thought
of
reversing
his
life
once
for
all
but
if
he
still
had
hesitation
and
fear
he
had
no
longer
the
firm
intention
of
resisting
he
now
accepted
in
principle
the
idea
of
a
change
of
existence
only
he
tried
to
retard
the
day
and
put
off
the
hour
he
tried
to
gain
time
then
like
people
who
grow
angry
at
having
to
wait
on
other
days
he
wished
to
put
off
the
inevitable
moment
no
longer
and
cried
within
himself
that
this
must
end
anything
rather
than
remain
as
he
was
then
as
this
desire
did
not
seem
heard
he
grew
discouraged
would
no
longer
think
of
anything
regretted
the
time
past
and
deplored
that
he
felt
himself
carried
along
by
such
a
current
and
when
he
was
rather
more
cheerful
he
tried
again
to
examine
himself
in
fact
i
do
not
at
all
know
how
i
stand
he
thought
this
flux
and
reflux
of
different
wishes
alarms
me
but
how
have
i
come
to
this
point
and
what
is
the
matter
with
me
what
he
felt
since
he
became
more
lucid
was
so
intangible
so
indefinite
and
yet
so
continuous
that
he
was
obliged
to
give
up
understanding
it
indeed
every
time
he
tried
to
examine
his
soul
a
curtain
of
mist
arose
and
hid
from
him
the
unseen
and
silent
approach
of
he
knew
not
what
the
only
impression
which
he
carried
with
him
as
he
rose
was
that
it
was
less
that
he
advanced
towards
the
unknown
but
that
this
unknown
invaded
him
penetrated
him
and
little
by
little
took
possession
of
him
when
he
spoke
to
the
abbé
of
this
state
at
once
cowardly
and
resigned
imploring
and
fearful
the
priest
only
smiled
busy
yourself
in
prayer
and
bow
down
your
back
he
said
one
day
but
i
am
tired
of
bending
my
back
and
of
trampling
always
on
the
same
spot
cried
durtal
i
have
had
enough
of
feeling
myself
taken
by
the
shoulders
and
led
i
know
not
where
it
is
really
time
that
in
one
way
or
another
this
situation
came
to
an
end
plainly
and
standing
up
and
looking
him
in
the
face
the
abbé
said
impressively
this
advance
towards
god
which
you
find
so
obscure
and
so
slow
is
on
the
contrary
so
luminous
and
so
rapid
that
it
astonishes
me
only
as
you
yourself
do
not
move
you
do
not
take
account
of
the
swiftness
with
which
you
are
borne
along
before
long
you
will
be
ripe
and
then
without
need
to
shake
the
tree
you
will
fall
off
of
yourself
the
question
we
have
now
to
answer
is
into
what
receptacle
we
must
put
you
when
at
last
you
fall
away
from
your
life
chapter
vii
but
but
thought
durtal
we
must
at
any
rate
come
to
an
understanding
the
abbé
wearies
me
with
his
quiet
assumptions
his
receptacle
in
which
he
must
place
me
he
does
not
i
suppose
think
of
making
me
a
seminarist
or
a
monk
the
seminary
at
my
age
is
devoid
of
interest
and
as
to
the
convent
it
is
attractive
from
the
mystical
point
of
view
and
even
enticing
from
the
artistic
standpoint
but
i
have
not
the
physical
aptitudes
still
less
the
spiritual
predispositions
to
shut
myself
up
for
ever
in
a
cloister
but
putting
that
aside
what
does
he
mean
on
the
other
hand
he
has
insisted
on
lending
me
the
works
of
saint
john
of
the
cross
and
has
made
me
read
them
he
has
then
an
aim
for
he
is
not
a
man
to
feel
his
way
as
he
walks
he
knows
what
he
wishes
and
where
he
is
going
does
he
imagine
that
i
am
intended
for
the
perfect
life
and
does
he
intend
to
put
me
on
my
guard
by
this
course
of
reading
against
the
disillusions
which
according
to
him
beginners
experience
his
scent
seems
to
fail
him
there
i
have
a
very
horror
of
bigotry
and
pious
polish
but
though
i
admire
i
do
not
feel
at
all
drawn
towards
the
phenomena
of
mysticism
no
i
am
interested
in
seeing
them
in
others
i
like
to
see
it
all
from
my
window
but
will
not
go
downstairs
i
have
no
pretension
to
become
a
saint
all
that
i
desire
is
to
attain
the
intermediate
state
between
and
sanctity
this
is
a
frightfully
low
ideal
perhaps
but
in
practice
it
is
the
only
one
i
am
capable
of
attaining
and
yet
then
these
questions
have
to
be
faced
if
i
am
mistaken
and
am
obeying
false
impulses
i
am
as
i
advance
on
the
verge
of
madness
how
except
by
a
special
grace
am
i
to
know
whether
i
am
in
the
right
way
or
walking
in
the
dark
towards
the
abyss
here
for
instance
are
those
conversations
between
god
and
the
soul
so
common
in
the
mystical
life
how
can
one
be
sure
that
this
interior
voice
these
distinct
words
not
heard
with
bodily
ears
but
perceived
by
the
soul
in
a
clearer
fashion
than
if
they
came
by
the
channels
of
sense
are
true
how
be
sure
that
they
emanate
from
god
not
from
our
imagination
or
from
the
devil
himself
i
know
indeed
that
saint
teresa
treats
this
matter
at
length
in
her
of
the
soul
and
that
she
points
out
the
signs
by
which
we
can
recognize
the
origin
of
the
words
but
her
proofs
do
not
seem
to
me
always
as
easy
to
discern
as
she
thinks
these
expressions
come
from
god
she
says
are
always
accompanied
by
an
effect
and
bring
with
them
an
authority
which
nothing
can
resist
thus
a
soul
is
in
affliction
and
the
lord
simply
suggests
the
words
trouble
not
thyself
and
at
once
the
whirlwind
passes
and
joy
revives
in
the
second
place
these
words
leave
an
indissoluble
peace
of
mind
they
engrave
themselves
on
the
memory
and
often
can
not
be
effaced
the
other
case
she
continues
these
words
proceed
from
imagination
or
from
the
demon
none
of
these
effects
are
produced
a
kind
of
uneasiness
anguish
and
doubt
torments
you
moreover
the
expressions
evaporate
in
part
and
fatigue
the
soul
which
endeavours
in
vain
to
recall
them
in
their
entirety
in
spite
of
these
tokens
we
are
in
fact
standing
on
shifting
ground
in
which
we
may
sink
at
every
step
but
in
his
turn
saint
john
of
the
cross
intervenes
and
tells
you
not
to
move
what
then
is
to
be
done
one
he
says
to
aspire
to
these
supernatural
communications
and
rest
there
for
two
motives
first
humility
the
perfect
abnegation
of
refusing
to
believe
in
them
the
second
that
in
acting
thus
we
deliver
ourselves
from
the
labour
necessary
to
assure
ourselves
whether
these
vocal
visions
are
true
or
false
and
so
we
are
dispensed
from
an
examination
which
has
no
other
profit
for
the
soul
than
loss
of
time
and
anxiety
good
but
if
these
words
are
really
pronounced
by
god
we
rebel
against
his
will
if
we
remain
deaf
to
them
and
then
as
saint
teresa
declares
it
is
not
in
our
power
not
to
listen
to
them
and
the
soul
can
only
think
of
what
it
hears
when
jesus
speaks
to
it
moreover
all
the
discussions
on
this
subject
are
uncertain
for
one
does
not
enter
of
one
own
will
into
the
strait
way
as
the
church
calls
it
we
are
led
and
even
thrown
into
it
often
against
the
will
and
resistance
is
impossible
phenomena
occur
and
nothing
in
the
world
has
power
to
check
them
witness
saint
teresa
who
resist
as
she
would
by
humility
fell
into
ecstasy
under
the
divine
breath
and
was
raised
from
the
ground
no
these
superhuman
conditions
alarm
me
and
i
do
not
hold
to
knowing
them
by
experience
as
to
saint
john
of
the
cross
the
abbé
is
not
wrong
in
calling
him
unique
but
though
he
sounds
the
lowest
strata
of
the
soul
and
reaches
where
human
auger
has
never
penetrated
he
wearies
me
all
the
same
in
my
admiration
for
his
work
is
full
of
nightmares
which
repel
me
i
am
not
certain
that
his
hell
is
correct
and
some
of
his
assertions
do
not
convince
me
what
he
calls
the
obscure
is
incomprehensible
sufferings
of
that
darkness
surpass
what
is
possible
he
cries
on
each
page
here
i
lose
foothold
i
can
imagine
though
i
have
not
experienced
them
the
moral
and
terrible
pangs
of
the
deaths
of
friends
and
relations
love
betrayed
hopes
which
failed
spiritual
sorrows
of
all
kinds
but
such
a
martyrdom
as
he
proclaims
as
superior
to
all
others
is
beyond
me
for
it
is
outside
our
human
interests
beyond
our
affections
he
moves
in
an
inaccessible
sphere
in
an
unknown
world
very
far
off
i
am
certainly
afraid
that
this
terrible
saint
a
true
man
of
the
south
abuses
metaphor
and
is
full
of
spanish
affectation
moreover
i
am
astonished
at
the
abbé
on
another
point
he
who
is
so
gentle
shows
a
certain
leaning
to
the
dry
bread
of
mysticism
the
effusions
of
ruysbröck
of
saint
angela
of
saint
catherine
of
genoa
touch
him
less
than
the
arguments
of
saints
who
are
hard
reasoners
yet
by
the
side
of
these
he
has
advised
me
to
read
marie
whom
he
ought
not
to
fancy
for
she
has
none
of
those
qualities
which
are
admired
in
the
works
of
saint
teresa
and
saint
john
of
the
cross
ah
he
may
flatter
himself
that
he
has
inflicted
on
me
a
complete
disillusion
by
lending
me
her
mystique
from
the
renown
of
this
spanish
woman
i
expected
the
breath
of
prophecy
wide
outlooks
extraordinary
visions
not
at
all
her
book
is
simply
strange
and
pompous
wearisome
and
cold
then
the
phraseology
of
her
book
is
intolerable
all
the
expressions
which
swarm
in
those
ponderous
volumes
divine
princess
great
queen
when
she
addresses
our
lady
who
in
her
turn
speaks
to
her
as
dearest
just
as
christ
calls
her
spouse
and
speaks
of
her
continually
as
object
of
my
pleasure
and
delight
the
way
in
which
she
speaks
of
the
angels
as
courtiers
of
the
great
king
set
my
nerves
on
edge
and
weary
me
they
smell
of
perriwigs
and
ruffles
bows
and
dances
like
versailles
a
sort
of
court
mysticism
in
which
christ
pontificates
attired
in
the
costume
of
louis
xiv
moreover
marie
enters
into
most
extravagant
details
she
tells
us
of
the
milk
of
our
lady
which
can
not
grow
sour
of
female
complaints
from
which
she
was
exempt
she
explains
the
mystery
of
the
conception
by
three
drops
of
blood
which
fell
from
the
heart
into
the
womb
of
mary
and
which
the
holy
ghost
used
to
form
the
child
lastly
she
declares
that
saint
michael
and
saint
gabriel
played
the
part
of
midwives
and
stood
living
under
human
forms
at
the
of
the
virgin
this
is
too
strong
i
know
well
that
the
abbé
would
say
that
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
with
these
singularities
and
these
errors
but
that
the
mystique
is
to
be
read
in
relation
to
the
inner
life
of
the
blessed
virgin
yes
but
then
the
book
of
ollier
which
treats
of
the
same
subject
seems
to
me
curious
and
trustworthy
in
quite
a
different
way
was
the
priest
forcing
the
note
playing
a
part
durtal
asked
himself
this
when
he
saw
how
determined
he
was
not
to
avoid
the
same
questions
during
a
certain
time
he
tried
now
and
then
in
order
to
see
how
the
matter
was
to
turn
the
conversation
but
the
abbé
smiled
and
brought
it
back
to
the
point
he
wished
when
he
thought
that
he
had
saturated
durtal
with
mystical
works
he
spoke
of
them
less
and
seemed
to
attach
himself
mainly
to
the
religious
orders
and
especially
to
that
of
saint
benedict
he
very
cleverly
induced
durtal
to
become
interested
in
this
institution
and
to
ask
him
about
it
and
when
once
he
had
entered
on
this
ground
he
did
not
depart
from
it
it
began
one
day
when
durtal
was
talking
with
him
about
plain
chant
you
have
reason
to
like
it
said
the
abbé
for
even
independently
of
the
liturgy
and
of
art
this
chant
if
i
may
believe
saint
justin
appeases
the
desires
and
concupiscences
of
the
flesh
et
concupiscentias
carnis
sedat
but
let
me
assure
you
you
only
know
it
by
hearsay
there
is
no
longer
any
true
plain
chant
in
the
churches
these
are
like
the
products
of
therapeutics
only
more
or
less
audacious
adulterations
presented
to
you
none
of
the
chants
which
are
to
some
extent
respected
by
choirs
the
ergo
for
example
are
now
exact
it
is
given
almost
faithfully
till
the
verse
fides
and
then
it
runs
off
the
rails
taking
no
account
of
the
shades
which
are
however
quite
perceptible
that
the
gregorian
melody
introduces
when
the
text
declares
the
impotence
of
reason
and
the
powerful
aid
of
faith
these
adulterations
are
still
more
apparent
if
you
listen
to
the
regina
after
compline
this
is
abridged
more
than
half
is
enervated
blanched
half
its
pauses
are
taken
away
it
is
reduced
to
a
mere
stump
of
ignoble
music
if
you
had
even
heard
this
magnificent
chant
among
the
trappists
you
would
weep
with
disgust
at
hearing
it
bawled
in
the
churches
at
paris
but
besides
the
textual
alteration
of
the
melody
as
we
now
have
it
the
way
in
which
the
plain
chant
is
bellowed
is
everywhere
absurd
one
of
the
first
conditions
for
rendering
it
well
is
that
the
voices
should
go
together
that
they
should
all
chant
in
the
same
time
syllable
for
syllable
and
note
for
note
in
one
word
it
must
be
in
unison
now
you
can
verify
it
yourself
the
gregorian
melody
is
not
thus
treated
every
voice
takes
its
own
part
and
is
isolated
next
plain
music
allows
no
accompaniment
it
must
be
chanted
alone
without
organ
it
bears
at
most
that
the
instrument
should
give
the
intonation
and
accompany
it
very
softly
just
enough
if
need
be
to
sustain
the
pitch
taken
by
the
voices
it
is
not
so
that
you
will
hear
it
given
in
the
churches
yes
i
know
it
well
said
durtal
when
i
hear
it
at
sulpice
severin
or
notre
dame
des
victoires
i
am
aware
that
it
is
sophisticated
but
you
must
admit
that
it
is
even
then
superb
i
do
not
defend
the
tricks
the
addition
of
fiorituri
the
falseness
of
the
musical
pauses
the
felonious
accompaniment
the
tone
inflicted
on
you
at
saint
sulpice
but
what
can
i
do
in
default
of
the
original
i
must
be
content
with
a
more
or
less
worthless
copy
and
i
repeat
even
executed
in
that
fashion
the
music
is
so
admirable
that
i
am
enchanted
by
it
but
said
the
abbé
quietly
nothing
obliges
you
to
listen
to
the
false
plain
chant
when
you
can
hear
the
true
for
saving
your
presence
there
exists
even
in
paris
a
chapel
where
it
is
intact
and
given
according
to
the
rules
of
which
i
have
spoken
indeed
and
where
is
that
at
the
benedictine
nuns
of
the
blessed
sacrament
in
the
rue
monsieur
and
can
anyone
enter
the
convent
and
be
present
at
the
offices
anyone
every
day
in
the
week
vespers
are
sung
at
three
and
on
sundays
high
mass
is
said
at
nine
ah
had
i
but
known
this
chapel
earlier
said
durtal
the
first
time
he
came
out
in
fact
it
combined
all
the
conditions
he
could
wish
situated
in
a
solitary
street
it
had
the
completest
privacy
the
architect
who
built
it
had
introduced
no
innovations
or
pretentiousness
had
built
a
gothic
church
and
introduced
no
fancies
of
his
own
it
was
cruciform
but
one
of
the
arms
was
scarcely
the
full
length
for
want
of
room
while
the
other
was
prolonged
into
a
hall
separated
from
the
choir
by
an
iron
grating
above
which
the
blessed
sacrament
was
adored
by
two
kneeling
angels
whose
lilac
wings
were
folded
over
thin
backs
except
these
two
figures
of
which
the
execution
was
truly
sinful
the
rest
was
at
least
veiled
by
shadow
and
was
not
too
afflicting
to
the
eyes
the
chapel
was
dim
and
always
at
the
time
of
the
offices
a
young
tall
and
pale
and
rather
bent
entered
like
a
shadow
and
each
time
that
she
passed
before
the
altar
she
fell
on
one
knee
and
bowed
her
head
profoundly
she
seemed
strange
and
scarcely
human
gliding
noiselessly
over
the
pavement
her
head
bowed
with
a
band
as
low
as
her
eyebrows
and
she
seemed
to
fly
like
a
large
bat
when
standing
before
the
tabernacle
she
turned
her
back
moving
her
large
black
sleeves
as
she
lighted
the
tapers
durtal
one
day
saw
her
features
sickly
but
charming
her
eyelids
dark
her
eyes
of
a
tired
blue
and
he
guessed
that
her
body
was
wasted
by
prayers
under
her
black
robe
drawn
together
by
a
leathern
girdle
ornamented
by
a
little
medal
of
the
blessed
sacrament
of
gilt
metal
under
the
trimming
near
her
heart
the
grating
of
the
enclosure
on
the
left
of
the
altar
was
large
and
well
lighted
from
behind
so
that
even
when
the
curtains
were
drawn
it
was
possible
to
see
the
whole
chapter
drawn
up
in
file
in
their
oaken
stalls
surmounted
at
the
end
by
a
higher
stall
in
which
the
abbess
sat
a
lighted
taper
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
before
it
a
nun
prayed
day
and
night
a
cord
round
her
neck
to
expiate
the
insults
offered
to
jesus
under
his
eucharistic
form
the
first
time
durtal
had
visited
the
chapel
he
had
gone
there
on
sunday
a
little
before
the
time
of
mass
and
he
had
been
thus
able
to
be
present
at
the
entry
of
the
benedictine
nuns
behind
the
iron
screen
they
advanced
two
and
two
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
grating
turned
to
the
altar
and
genuflected
then
each
bowed
to
her
neighbour
and
so
to
the
end
of
this
procession
of
women
in
black
only
brightened
by
the
whiteness
of
the
and
the
collar
and
the
gilt
spot
of
the
little
monstrance
on
the
breast
the
novices
came
last
to
be
recognized
by
the
white
veils
which
covered
their
heads
and
when
an
old
priest
assisted
by
a
sacristan
began
the
mass
softly
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
a
small
organ
gave
the
tone
to
the
voices
then
durtal
might
well
wonder
for
he
had
never
before
heard
a
sole
and
only
voice
made
up
of
perhaps
some
thirty
of
a
tone
so
strange
a
superterrestrial
voice
which
burnt
upon
itself
in
the
air
and
intertwined
its
soft
cooings
this
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
icy
and
obstinate
lament
of
the
carmelites
nor
was
it
like
the
unsexed
tone
the
child
voice
squeaking
rounded
off
at
the
end
of
the
franciscan
nuns
but
quite
another
thing
at
la
glacière
in
fact
those
raw
voices
though
softened
and
watered
by
prayers
kept
somewhat
of
the
drawling
almost
vulgar
inflexion
of
the
people
from
whom
they
came
they
were
greatly
purified
but
remained
none
the
less
human
here
the
tenderness
of
tones
was
rendered
angelic
that
voice
with
no
defined
origin
long
bolted
through
the
divine
sieve
patiently
modelled
for
the
liturgical
chant
caught
fire
as
it
unfolded
blazed
in
virginal
clusters
of
white
sound
died
down
flowered
out
again
in
pale
pleadings
distant
seraphic
at
the
end
of
certain
chants
thus
interpreted
the
mass
gave
a
special
accent
to
the
sense
of
the
sequences
standing
behind
the
grating
the
convent
answered
the
priest
durtal
had
then
heard
after
a
mournful
and
solemn
kyrie
eleison
sharp
and
almost
tragic
the
decided
cry
so
loving
and
so
grave
of
the
gloria
in
excelsis
to
the
true
plain
chant
he
had
listened
to
the
credo
slow
and
bare
solemn
and
pensive
and
he
was
able
to
affirm
that
these
chants
were
totally
different
from
those
which
were
sung
everywhere
in
the
churches
severin
and
sulpice
now
seemed
to
him
profane
in
the
place
of
their
gentle
warmth
their
curls
and
their
fringes
the
angles
of
their
polished
melodies
their
modern
endings
their
incoherent
accompaniments
arranged
for
the
organ
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
chant
thin
sharp
and
nervous
like
the
work
of
an
early
master
and
saw
the
ascetic
severity
of
its
lines
its
sonorous
colouring
the
brightness
of
its
metal
hammered
out
with
the
rude
yet
charming
art
of
gothic
jewels
he
heard
under
the
woven
robe
of
sound
the
beating
of
a
simple
heart
the
ingenuous
love
of
ages
and
he
noticed
that
curious
shade
in
benedictine
music
it
ended
all
cries
of
adoration
all
tender
cooings
in
a
timid
murmur
cut
short
as
though
shrinking
in
humility
effacing
itself
modestly
as
though
asking
pardon
of
god
for
daring
to
love
him
ah
you
were
very
right
to
send
me
there
said
durtal
to
the
abbé
when
next
he
saw
him
i
had
no
choice
answered
the
priest
smiling
for
the
plain
chant
is
respected
only
in
convents
under
the
benedictine
rule
that
grand
order
has
restored
it
dom
pothier
has
done
for
it
what
dom
guéranger
has
done
for
the
liturgy
moreover
beyond
the
authenticity
of
the
vocal
text
and
the
manner
of
rendering
it
there
are
still
two
essential
conditions
for
restoring
the
special
life
of
these
melodies
and
they
are
hardly
found
except
in
cloisters
first
faith
and
next
the
understanding
the
meaning
of
the
words
sung
but
interrupted
durtal
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
benedictine
nuns
know
latin
i
beg
your
pardon
among
the
nuns
of
saint
benedict
and
even
among
the
cloistered
sisters
of
other
orders
there
are
a
certain
number
who
study
the
language
enough
to
understand
the
breviary
and
the
psalms
that
is
a
serious
advantage
which
they
have
over
the
choirs
composed
for
the
most
part
of
artisans
without
instruction
and
without
piety
only
simple
workers
with
their
voices
now
without
wishing
to
abate
your
enthusiasm
for
the
musical
honesty
of
these
nuns
i
am
bound
to
say
that
in
order
to
understand
this
magnificent
chant
in
its
height
and
breadth
you
must
hear
it
not
winnowed
by
the
mouths
of
virgins
even
if
unsexed
but
as
it
issues
unsmoothed
untrimmed
from
the
lips
of
men
unfortunately
though
there
are
at
paris
in
the
rue
monsieur
and
the
rue
tournefort
two
communities
of
benedictine
nuns
there
is
not
on
the
other
hand
a
single
monastery
of
benedictine
monks
at
the
rue
monsieur
do
they
absolutely
follow
the
rule
of
saint
benedict
yes
but
over
and
above
the
usual
vows
of
poverty
chastity
remaining
in
the
cloister
obedience
they
make
a
further
vow
of
separation
and
adoration
of
the
blessed
sacrament
as
formulated
by
saint
mechtilde
and
so
they
lead
the
most
austere
existence
of
any
nuns
they
scarcely
taste
flesh
they
rise
at
two
in
the
morning
to
sing
matins
and
lauds
night
and
day
summer
and
winter
they
take
turns
before
the
taper
of
reparation
and
before
the
altar
it
need
not
be
said
continued
the
abbé
after
a
pause
that
woman
is
stronger
and
braver
than
man
no
male
ascetic
could
live
and
lead
such
a
life
especially
in
the
enervating
atmosphere
of
paris
what
perhaps
astounds
me
still
more
said
durtal
is
the
kind
of
obedience
exacted
of
them
how
can
a
creature
endowed
with
free
will
annihilate
herself
to
such
an
extent
oh
said
the
abbé
the
obedience
is
the
same
in
all
the
great
orders
absolute
without
reserve
its
formula
is
well
summed
up
by
saint
augustine
listen
to
this
sentence
which
i
remember
to
have
read
in
a
commentary
on
his
rule
must
enter
into
the
feelings
of
a
beast
of
burthen
and
allow
ourselves
to
be
led
like
a
horse
or
a
mule
which
have
no
understanding
or
rather
that
obedience
may
be
still
more
perfect
since
these
animals
kick
against
the
spur
we
must
be
in
the
hands
of
a
superior
like
a
block
or
the
stock
of
a
tree
which
has
neither
life
nor
movement
nor
action
nor
will
nor
judgment
is
that
clear
it
is
most
frightful
i
quite
admit
said
durtal
that
in
exchange
for
such
abnegation
the
nuns
must
be
powerfully
aided
from
on
high
but
are
there
not
some
moments
of
falling
away
some
cases
of
despair
some
instants
in
which
they
pine
for
a
natural
life
in
the
open
air
in
which
they
lament
that
death
in
life
which
they
have
made
for
themselves
are
there
not
days
in
which
their
senses
wake
and
cry
aloud
no
doubt
in
the
cloistered
life
the
age
of
is
terrible
to
pass
then
a
passionate
crisis
arises
if
a
woman
doubles
that
cape
and
she
almost
always
does
so
she
is
safe
but
carnal
emotions
are
not
to
speak
correctly
the
most
troublesome
assault
they
have
to
undergo
the
real
punishment
they
endure
in
those
hours
of
sorrow
is
the
ardent
wild
regret
for
that
maternity
of
which
they
are
ignorant
the
desolate
womb
of
woman
revolts
and
full
of
god
though
she
be
her
heart
is
breaking
the
child
jesus
whom
they
have
loved
so
well
then
appears
so
far
off
and
so
inaccessible
and
his
very
sight
would
hardly
satisfy
them
for
they
have
dreamed
of
holding
him
in
their
arms
of
swathing
and
rocking
him
of
giving
him
suck
in
one
word
of
being
mothers
other
nuns
undergo
no
precise
attack
no
assault
to
which
a
name
can
be
given
but
without
any
definite
reason
they
languish
and
die
suddenly
like
a
taper
blown
out
the
torpor
of
the
cloister
kills
them
but
indeed
monsieur
these
details
are
far
from
encouraging
the
priest
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
the
poor
reverse
of
a
splendid
stuff
he
said
wonderful
recompenses
are
granted
even
in
this
world
to
souls
in
convents
nor
do
i
suppose
that
if
a
nun
fall
stricken
in
the
flesh
she
is
abandoned
what
does
the
mother
abbess
in
such
a
case
she
acts
according
to
the
bodily
temperament
and
state
of
the
soul
of
the
sick
person
note
that
she
has
been
able
to
follow
her
during
the
years
of
her
probation
that
she
has
necessarily
gained
an
influence
over
her
at
such
times
therefore
she
will
watch
her
daughter
very
closely
endeavour
to
turn
the
course
of
her
ideas
breaking
her
by
hard
work
and
by
occupying
her
mind
she
must
not
leave
her
alone
must
diminish
her
prayers
if
need
be
restrict
her
hours
of
office
lessen
her
fasts
give
her
if
the
case
demands
it
better
food
in
other
cases
on
the
contrary
she
will
have
recourse
to
more
frequent
communions
lessen
her
food
or
cause
her
to
be
blooded
mix
cooling
meats
with
her
diet
and
above
all
things
she
and
all
the
community
must
pray
for
her
an
old
benedictine
abbess
whom
i
knew
at
an
incomparable
guide
of
souls
limited
before
all
things
the
length
of
confessions
the
moment
she
saw
the
least
symptoms
arise
she
gave
two
minutes
watch
in
hand
to
the
penitent
and
when
the
time
was
up
she
sent
her
back
from
the
confessional
to
mix
with
her
companions
why
so
because
in
convents
even
for
souls
which
are
well
confession
is
a
most
dangerous
relaxation
it
is
as
it
were
too
long
and
too
warm
a
bath
in
it
nuns
go
to
excess
open
their
hearts
uselessly
dwell
upon
their
troubles
accentuate
them
and
revel
in
them
they
come
out
more
weakened
and
more
ill
than
before
two
minutes
ought
indeed
to
be
enough
for
a
nun
in
which
to
tell
her
little
sins
yet
yet
i
must
admit
it
the
confessor
is
a
danger
for
a
convent
not
that
i
suspect
his
honour
that
is
not
at
all
what
i
mean
but
as
he
is
generally
chosen
from
among
the
bishop
favourites
there
are
many
chances
that
he
may
be
a
man
who
knows
nothing
and
quite
ignorant
of
how
to
deal
with
such
souls
ends
by
unsettling
them
while
he
consoles
them
again
if
demoniac
attacks
so
common
in
nunneries
occur
the
poor
man
can
only
gape
gives
all
sorts
of
confused
counsel
and
hinders
the
energy
of
the
abbess
who
in
such
matters
knows
far
better
than
he
and
said
durtal
who
chose
his
words
carefully
tell
me
i
suppose
that
tales
like
those
which
diderot
gives
in
his
foolish
volume
religieuse
are
incorrect
unless
a
community
is
rotted
by
a
superior
given
over
to
satanism
which
thank
god
is
rare
the
filthy
stories
told
by
that
writer
are
false
and
there
is
moreover
a
good
reason
why
it
should
be
so
for
there
is
a
sin
which
is
the
very
antidote
of
the
other
the
sin
of
zeal
what
yes
the
sin
of
zeal
which
causes
the
denunciation
of
our
neighbour
gives
scope
to
jealousy
creates
spying
to
satisfy
hate
that
is
the
real
sin
of
the
cloister
well
i
assure
you
that
if
two
sisters
became
quite
shameless
they
would
be
denounced
at
once
but
i
thought
monsieur
that
was
allowed
by
the
rules
of
most
orders
it
is
but
perhaps
there
is
a
temptation
to
carry
it
somewhat
to
excess
especially
in
convents
of
women
for
you
can
imagine
that
if
nunneries
contain
pure
mystics
real
saints
they
have
in
them
also
some
nuns
less
advanced
in
the
way
of
perfection
and
who
even
still
retain
some
faults
come
since
we
are
in
the
chapter
of
minute
details
dare
i
ask
if
cleanliness
is
not
just
a
little
neglected
by
these
good
women
i
can
not
say
all
that
i
know
is
that
in
the
benedictine
abbeys
i
have
known
each
nun
was
free
to
act
as
seemed
good
to
her
in
certain
augustinian
constitutions
the
case
was
provided
for
in
contrary
fashion
it
was
forbidden
to
wash
the
body
except
once
a
month
on
the
other
hand
amongst
the
carmelites
cleanliness
is
exacted
saint
teresa
hated
dirt
and
loved
white
linen
her
daughters
have
even
i
think
a
right
to
have
a
flask
of
eau
de
cologne
in
their
cells
you
see
this
depends
on
the
order
and
probably
also
when
the
rule
does
not
expressly
mention
it
on
the
ideas
which
the
superior
may
have
on
the
subject
i
will
add
that
this
question
must
not
be
looked
at
only
from
the
worldly
point
of
view
for
corporal
dirt
is
for
certain
souls
an
additional
suffering
and
mortification
which
they
impose
on
themselves
as
benedict
labre
he
who
picked
up
vermin
which
left
him
and
put
them
piously
in
his
sleeve
i
prefer
mortifications
of
another
kind
there
are
harder
ones
believe
me
and
i
think
they
would
suit
you
better
would
you
like
to
imitate
suso
who
to
subdue
his
passions
bore
on
his
naked
shoulders
for
eighteen
years
an
enormous
cross
set
with
nails
whose
points
pierced
his
flesh
more
than
that
he
imprisoned
his
hands
in
leather
gloves
which
also
bristled
with
nails
lest
he
should
be
tempted
to
dress
his
wounds
saint
rose
of
lima
treated
herself
no
better
she
bound
a
chain
so
tightly
round
her
body
that
it
penetrated
the
skin
and
hid
itself
under
the
bleeding
pad
of
flesh
she
wore
also
a
horsehair
girdle
set
with
pins
and
lay
on
shards
of
glass
but
all
these
trials
are
nothing
in
comparison
of
those
inflicted
on
herself
by
a
capuchin
nun
the
venerable
mother
pasidée
of
siena
she
scourged
herself
with
branches
of
juniper
and
holly
then
poured
vinegar
into
her
wounds
and
sprinkled
them
with
salt
she
slept
in
winter
on
the
snow
in
summer
on
bunches
of
nettles
or
pebbles
or
brushes
put
drops
of
hot
lead
in
her
shoes
knelt
upon
thistles
thorns
and
sticks
in
january
she
broke
the
ice
in
a
cask
and
plunged
into
it
and
she
even
herself
by
hanging
head
downwards
in
a
chimney
in
which
damp
straw
was
lighted
but
that
is
enough
indeed
said
the
abbé
laughing
if
you
had
to
choose
you
would
like
best
the
mortifications
which
benedict
labre
imposed
on
himself
i
would
rather
have
none
at
all
answered
durtal
there
was
a
moment
pause
durtal
thoughts
went
back
to
the
benedictine
nuns
but
said
he
why
do
they
put
in
the
religieuse
after
their
title
benedictine
nuns
of
the
blessed
sacrament
this
further
name
of
saint
louis
du
temple
because
said
the
abbé
their
first
convent
was
founded
on
the
actual
ruins
of
the
temple
prison
given
them
by
royal
warrant
when
louis
xviii
returned
to
france
their
foundress
and
superior
was
louise
adélaïde
de
bourbon
condé
an
unfortunate
princess
of
many
wanderings
almost
the
whole
of
whose
life
was
spent
in
exile
expelled
from
france
by
the
revolution
and
the
empire
hunted
in
almost
every
country
in
europe
she
wandered
by
chance
among
convents
seeking
shelter
now
among
the
nuns
of
the
annunciation
at
turin
and
the
capuchins
in
piedmont
now
among
the
trappistines
in
switzerland
and
the
sisters
of
the
visitation
at
vienna
now
among
the
benedictines
of
lithuania
and
poland
at
last
she
found
shelter
among
the
benedictines
in
norfolk
till
she
could
again
enter
france
she
was
a
woman
singularly
trained
in
monastic
science
and
experienced
in
the
direction
of
souls
she
desired
that
in
her
abbey
every
sister
should
offer
herself
to
heaven
in
reparation
for
crimes
committed
and
that
she
should
accept
the
most
painful
privations
to
make
up
for
those
which
might
be
committed
she
instituted
there
the
perpetual
adoration
and
introduced
the
plain
chant
in
all
its
purity
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
it
is
as
you
have
been
able
to
hear
there
preserved
intact
it
is
true
that
since
her
time
her
nuns
have
had
lessons
from
dom
schmitt
one
of
the
most
learned
monks
in
that
matter
then
after
the
death
of
the
princess
which
took
place
i
think
in
it
was
perceived
that
her
body
exhaled
the
odour
of
sanctity
and
though
she
has
not
been
canonized
her
intercession
is
invoked
by
her
daughters
in
certain
cases
thus
for
example
the
benedictine
nuns
of
the
rue
monsieur
ask
her
assistance
when
they
lose
anything
and
their
experience
shows
that
their
prayer
is
never
in
vain
since
the
object
lost
is
found
almost
at
once
but
continued
the
abbé
since
you
like
the
convent
so
well
go
there
especially
when
it
is
lighted
up
the
priest
rose
and
took
up
a
semaine
religieuse
which
lay
upon
the
table
he
turned
over
the
leaves
see
he
said
and
read
vespers
chanted
ceremony
of
clothing
presided
over
by
the
very
reverend
father
dom
etienne
abbot
of
the
grande
trappe
and
benediction
that
is
a
ceremony
which
interests
me
much
i
too
shall
probably
be
there
then
we
can
meet
in
the
chapel
just
so
these
ceremonies
of
clothing
have
not
now
the
gaiety
they
had
in
the
eighteenth
century
in
certain
benedictine
institutions
amongst
others
the
abbey
de
bourbourg
in
flanders
said
the
abbé
smiling
after
a
silence
and
since
durtal
looked
at
him
questioningly
yes
there
was
no
sadness
about
it
or
at
least
it
had
a
special
sadness
of
its
own
you
shall
judge
on
the
eve
of
the
day
that
the
postulant
was
to
take
the
habit
she
was
presented
to
the
abbess
of
bourbourg
by
the
governor
of
the
town
bread
and
wine
were
offered
to
her
and
she
tasted
them
in
the
church
itself
on
the
morrow
she
appeared
magnificently
dressed
at
a
ball
which
was
attended
by
the
whole
community
of
nuns
where
she
danced
then
she
asked
her
blessing
and
was
conducted
with
violins
playing
to
the
chapel
where
the
abbess
took
possession
of
her
she
had
for
the
last
time
seen
at
the
ball
the
joys
of
the
world
for
she
was
immediately
shut
up
for
the
rest
of
her
days
in
the
cloister
the
joy
of
the
dance
of
death
said
durtal
monastic
customs
and
congregations
were
strange
in
old
days
no
doubt
but
they
are
lost
in
the
night
of
time
i
remember
however
that
in
the
fifteenth
century
there
existed
under
the
rule
of
saint
augustine
an
order
strange
indeed
called
the
order
of
the
daughters
of
saint
magloire
whose
convent
was
in
the
rue
saint
denys
at
paris
the
conditions
of
admission
were
the
reverse
of
those
of
all
other
charters
the
postulant
had
to
swear
on
the
holy
gospels
that
she
had
been
unchaste
and
no
one
believed
her
oath
she
was
examined
and
if
her
oath
were
false
she
was
declared
unworthy
to
be
received
nor
might
she
have
brought
about
this
condition
expressly
in
order
to
enter
the
convent
she
must
have
well
and
truly
given
herself
over
to
sin
before
she
came
to
ask
the
shelter
of
the
cloister
they
were
in
fact
a
troop
of
penitent
girls
and
the
rule
of
their
subjection
was
savage
they
were
whipped
locked
up
subjected
to
the
most
rigid
fasts
made
their
confessions
thrice
in
the
week
rose
at
midnight
were
under
the
most
unremitting
surveillance
were
even
attended
in
their
most
secret
retirement
their
mortifications
were
incessant
and
their
closure
absolute
i
need
hardly
add
that
this
nunnery
is
dead
nor
likely
to
revive
cried
durtal
well
then
monsieur
we
meet
on
sunday
in
the
rue
monsieur
and
on
the
assent
of
the
abbé
durtal
went
his
way
with
the
strangest
ideas
in
his
head
about
the
monastic
orders
the
thing
would
be
he
thought
to
found
an
abbey
where
one
could
work
at
ease
in
a
good
library
there
should
be
several
monks
with
decent
meals
plenty
of
tobacco
and
permission
to
take
a
turn
on
the
quays
now
and
then
and
he
laughed
but
then
that
would
not
be
a
monastery
or
only
a
dominican
monastery
with
monks
who
dine
out
and
have
at
least
the
amusement
of
preaching
chapter
viii
on
sunday
morning
on
his
way
to
the
rue
monsieur
durtal
chewed
the
cud
of
his
reflections
on
the
monasteries
it
is
certain
he
thought
that
in
the
accumulated
filth
of
ages
they
alone
have
remained
clean
are
truly
in
relation
with
heaven
and
serve
as
interpreters
between
it
and
earth
but
we
must
thoroughly
understand
and
specify
that
we
are
speaking
only
of
the
cloistered
orders
which
have
remained
as
far
as
possible
poor
and
thinking
of
the
communities
of
women
he
murmured
as
he
hastened
his
steps
here
is
a
surprising
fact
which
proves
once
more
the
incomparable
genius
with
which
the
church
is
endowed
she
has
been
able
to
bring
into
common
life
women
who
do
not
assassinate
each
other
and
obey
without
recalcitrancy
the
orders
of
another
woman
wonderful
well
here
i
am
and
durtal
who
knew
he
was
late
hastened
into
the
court
of
the
benedictine
nunnery
took
the
steps
of
the
little
church
four
at
a
time
and
pushed
the
door
open
he
paused
in
hesitation
on
the
threshold
dazzled
by
the
blaze
of
the
lighted
chapel
lamps
were
lit
everywhere
and
overhead
the
altar
flamed
with
a
forest
of
tapers
against
which
stood
out
as
on
a
gold
ground
the
ruddy
face
of
a
bishop
all
in
white
durtal
glided
among
the
crowd
elbowing
his
way
till
he
saw
the
abbé
gévresin
beckoning
to
him
he
joined
him
and
sat
down
on
the
chair
the
priest
had
kept
for
him
and
examined
the
abbot
of
grande
trappe
surrounded
by
priests
in
chasubles
and
choir
boys
some
in
red
and
others
in
blue
followed
by
a
trappist
with
shaven
crown
surrounded
by
a
fringe
of
hair
holding
a
wooden
cross
on
the
reverse
of
which
was
carved
the
small
figure
of
a
monk
clad
in
a
white
cowl
with
long
sleeves
and
a
gold
button
on
his
hood
his
abbot
cross
on
his
breast
his
head
covered
with
an
old
french
mitre
of
low
form
dom
etienne
with
his
broad
shoulders
his
greyish
beard
his
ruddy
colour
had
a
look
of
an
old
burgundian
tanned
by
the
sun
while
working
at
his
vines
he
seemed
moreover
a
good
sort
of
man
uneasy
under
his
mitre
oppressed
by
his
honours
a
sharp
perfume
which
burnt
the
nose
as
a
spice
burns
the
tongue
the
perfume
of
myrrh
floated
in
the
air
the
crowds
surged
behind
the
grating
from
which
the
curtain
was
withdrawn
the
nuns
standing
sang
the
hymn
of
saint
ambrose
jesu
corona
virginum
while
the
bells
of
the
abbey
rang
a
peal
in
the
short
aisle
leading
from
the
porch
to
the
choir
a
bending
line
of
women
on
either
side
a
and
entered
and
behind
them
appeared
the
novice
dressed
as
a
bride
she
was
dark
slight
and
very
short
and
came
forward
shyly
with
downcast
eyes
between
her
mother
and
sister
at
first
sight
durtal
thought
her
insignificant
scarcely
pretty
a
mere
nobody
and
he
looked
instinctively
for
the
other
party
put
out
in
his
sense
of
fitness
by
the
absence
of
a
man
in
the
marriage
procession
striving
against
her
agitation
the
postulant
walked
up
the
nave
into
the
choir
and
knelt
on
the
left
before
a
large
taper
her
mother
and
sister
on
either
side
as
bridesmaids
dom
etienne
genuflected
to
the
altar
mounted
the
steps
and
sat
down
in
a
red
velvet
placed
on
the
highest
step
then
one
of
the
priests
conducted
the
girl
who
knelt
alone
before
the
monk
dom
etienne
was
motionless
as
a
figure
of
buddha
with
the
same
gesture
he
lifted
one
finger
and
said
gently
to
the
novice
what
is
it
you
ask
she
spoke
so
low
as
scarcely
to
be
heard
father
feeling
in
myself
an
ardent
desire
to
sacrifice
myself
to
god
as
a
victim
in
union
with
our
lord
jesus
christ
immolated
on
our
altars
and
to
spend
my
life
in
perpetual
adoration
of
his
divine
sacrament
under
the
observance
of
the
rule
of
our
glorious
father
saint
benedict
i
humbly
ask
of
you
the
grace
of
the
holy
habit
i
will
give
it
you
willingly
if
you
believe
you
can
conform
your
life
to
that
of
a
victim
devoted
to
the
holy
sacrament
and
she
answered
in
a
firmer
tone
i
trust
so
leaning
on
the
infinite
goodness
of
my
saviour
jesus
christ
god
give
you
perseverance
my
daughter
said
the
prelate
he
rose
turned
to
the
altar
genuflected
and
with
uncovered
head
began
the
chant
veni
creator
taken
up
by
the
voices
of
the
nuns
behind
the
light
screen
of
iron
then
he
replaced
his
mitre
and
prayed
while
the
chanted
psalms
rose
under
the
arches
the
novice
who
in
the
meantime
had
been
reconducted
to
her
place
at
the
rose
genuflected
to
the
altar
and
then
knelt
between
her
two
bridesmaids
before
the
abbot
of
la
trappe
who
had
reseated
himself
her
two
companions
lifted
the
veil
of
the
bride
took
off
her
wreath
of
orange
flowers
unrolled
the
coils
of
her
hair
while
a
priest
spread
a
napkin
on
the
knees
of
the
prelate
and
the
deacon
presented
a
pair
of
long
scissors
on
a
salver
then
before
the
gesture
of
this
monk
making
himself
ready
like
an
executioner
to
shear
the
condemned
person
whose
hour
of
expiation
was
at
hand
the
terrible
beauty
of
innocence
becoming
like
crime
in
substitution
for
sins
of
which
she
was
ignorant
which
she
could
not
even
understand
was
evident
to
the
public
who
had
come
to
the
chapel
out
of
curiosity
and
in
consternation
at
the
superhuman
denial
of
justice
it
trembled
when
the
bishop
seized
the
entire
handful
of
her
hair
and
drew
it
towards
him
over
her
brow
then
there
was
as
it
were
a
flash
of
steel
in
a
dark
shower
in
the
silence
of
the
church
the
grinding
of
the
scissors
was
heard
in
the
mass
of
hair
which
fell
under
the
blades
and
then
all
was
silent
dom
etienne
opened
his
hand
and
the
rain
fell
on
his
knees
in
long
black
threads
there
was
a
sigh
of
relief
when
the
priests
and
bridesmaids
led
away
the
bride
looking
strange
in
her
train
with
her
head
discrowned
and
her
neck
bare
the
procession
returned
almost
immediately
there
was
no
longer
a
bride
in
a
white
skirt
but
a
nun
in
a
black
robe
she
bowed
before
the
trappist
and
again
knelt
between
her
mother
and
sister
then
while
the
abbot
prayed
the
lord
to
bless
his
handmaid
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
the
deacon
took
from
a
credence
near
the
altar
a
basket
wherein
under
loose
rose
leaves
were
folded
a
girdle
of
untanned
leather
emblem
of
the
end
of
that
luxury
which
the
fathers
of
the
church
placed
in
the
region
of
the
reins
a
scapular
symbol
of
a
life
crucified
to
the
world
a
veil
which
signifies
the
solitude
of
the
life
hidden
in
god
and
the
prelate
explained
the
sense
of
these
emblems
to
the
novice
then
taking
the
lighted
taper
from
the
candlestick
before
her
he
gave
it
to
her
declaring
in
one
phrase
the
meaning
of
his
action
accipe
charissima
soror
lumen
christi
then
dom
etienne
took
the
sprinkler
which
a
priest
handed
him
with
an
inclination
and
as
in
the
general
absolution
of
the
dead
he
sprinkled
the
girl
with
holy
water
in
the
form
of
a
cross
then
he
sat
down
and
spoke
gently
and
quietly
without
using
a
single
gesture
he
spoke
to
the
postulant
alone
praising
the
august
and
humble
life
of
the
cloister
look
not
back
he
said
have
no
regrets
for
by
my
voice
jesus
repeats
to
you
the
promise
once
made
to
the
magdalen
is
the
better
part
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
you
say
also
to
yourself
my
daughter
that
henceforward
taken
away
from
the
eternal
trifling
of
labours
in
vain
you
will
accomplish
a
useful
work
upon
earth
you
will
practise
charity
in
its
highest
form
you
will
make
expiation
for
others
you
will
pray
for
those
who
never
pray
you
will
aid
so
far
as
your
strength
permits
to
make
amends
for
the
hate
the
world
bears
to
the
saviour
suffer
and
you
will
be
happy
love
your
spouse
and
you
will
see
how
tender
he
is
to
his
elect
believe
me
his
love
is
such
that
he
will
not
even
wait
till
you
are
purified
by
death
to
recompense
you
for
your
miserable
mortifications
your
poor
sufferings
even
before
your
hour
is
come
he
will
heap
his
graces
upon
you
and
you
will
beg
him
to
let
you
die
so
greatly
will
the
excess
of
these
joys
exceed
your
strength
little
by
little
the
old
monk
grew
warm
and
returned
to
the
words
of
christ
to
the
magdalen
showing
how
in
reference
to
her
jesus
set
forward
the
excellence
of
the
contemplative
over
the
other
orders
and
gave
brief
advice
dwelling
on
the
necessity
of
humility
and
poverty
which
are
as
saint
clare
says
the
two
great
walls
of
cloistered
life
then
he
blessed
the
novice
who
kissed
his
hand
and
when
she
had
returned
to
her
place
he
prayed
to
the
lord
lifting
his
eyes
to
heaven
that
he
would
accept
this
nun
who
offered
herself
as
a
victim
for
the
sins
of
the
world
then
standing
he
intoned
the
te
deum
every
one
rose
and
preceded
by
the
cross
and
torch
bearers
the
procession
passed
out
of
the
church
and
was
massed
in
the
court
then
durtal
might
have
believed
himself
carried
back
far
from
paris
into
the
heart
of
the
middle
ages
the
court
surrounded
by
buildings
was
closed
opposite
the
by
a
high
wall
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
on
each
side
six
thin
pines
rocked
to
and
fro
and
chanting
was
heard
behind
the
wall
the
postulant
in
front
alone
near
the
closed
door
held
her
torch
with
her
head
bent
the
abbot
of
la
trappe
leaning
on
his
crosier
waited
unmoving
a
few
paces
from
her
durtal
examined
their
faces
the
girl
so
commonplace
in
her
bridal
costume
had
become
charming
her
body
was
now
full
of
a
timid
grace
the
lines
somewhat
too
marked
under
her
worldly
dress
were
softened
under
her
religious
shroud
her
outline
was
only
a
simple
sketch
it
was
as
though
the
years
had
rolled
back
and
as
though
there
was
a
return
to
the
forms
only
prophesied
in
childhood
durtal
drew
near
to
examine
her
better
he
tried
to
look
at
her
face
but
under
the
chill
bandage
of
her
she
remained
mute
and
as
if
absent
from
life
with
her
eyes
closed
and
as
though
she
lived
only
in
the
smile
of
her
happy
lips
seen
nearer
the
monk
who
had
seemed
so
stout
and
ruddy
in
the
chapel
seemed
also
changed
his
frame
remained
robust
and
his
complexion
bright
but
his
eyes
of
a
light
blue
like
chalk
water
water
without
reflections
or
waves
eyes
wonderfully
pure
changed
the
common
expression
of
his
features
and
took
away
from
him
that
look
of
a
which
he
had
at
a
distance
it
is
clear
thought
durtal
that
the
soul
is
everything
in
these
people
and
their
faces
are
modelled
by
it
there
is
a
holy
clearness
in
their
eyes
and
their
lips
in
those
only
apertures
through
which
the
soul
comes
to
look
out
of
the
body
and
almost
shows
itself
the
chants
behind
the
wall
suddenly
ceased
the
girl
made
a
step
forward
and
knocked
with
her
closed
fingers
at
the
door
and
then
with
a
failing
voice
she
sang
aperite
mihi
portas
justitiae
ingressa
in
eas
confitebor
domino
the
door
opened
another
large
court
paved
with
pebbles
was
seen
bounded
at
the
end
by
a
building
and
all
the
community
in
a
sort
of
semicircle
with
black
books
in
their
hands
cried
haec
porta
domini
justi
intrabunt
in
eam
the
novice
made
another
step
to
the
sill
and
answered
in
her
voice
ingrediar
in
locum
tabernaculi
admirabilis
usque
ad
domum
dei
and
the
choir
of
nuns
unmoving
answered
haec
est
domus
domini
firmiter
aedificata
bene
fundata
est
supra
firmam
petram
durtal
hastily
looked
at
those
faces
which
could
only
be
seen
for
a
few
minutes
and
on
the
occasion
of
such
a
ceremony
it
was
a
row
of
dead
bodies
standing
in
black
shrouds
all
were
bloodless
with
white
cheeks
lilac
eyelids
and
grey
lips
the
voices
of
all
were
exhausted
and
fined
down
by
prayer
and
most
of
them
even
the
young
were
bent
their
poor
bodies
are
worn
with
austere
fatigue
thought
durtal
but
his
reflections
were
cut
short
the
bride
now
kneeling
on
the
threshold
turned
to
dom
etienne
and
chanted
in
a
low
voice
haec
requies
mea
in
saeculum
saeculi
hic
habitabo
quoniam
elegi
eam
the
monk
laid
aside
his
mitre
and
crosier
and
said
confirma
hoc
deus
quod
operatus
es
in
nobis
and
the
postulant
murmured
a
templo
sacro
tuo
quod
est
in
jerusalem
then
before
his
head
and
resuming
his
crosier
the
prelate
prayed
god
almighty
to
pour
the
dew
of
his
blessing
on
his
handmaid
then
directing
the
girl
towards
a
nun
who
left
the
group
of
sisters
and
advanced
to
the
threshold
he
said
to
her
into
your
hands
madame
we
commit
this
new
bride
of
the
lord
sustain
her
in
the
holy
resolution
she
has
so
solemnly
taken
upon
her
in
asking
to
sacrifice
herself
to
god
as
a
victim
and
to
dedicate
her
life
in
honour
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
sacrificed
on
our
altars
lead
her
in
the
way
of
the
divine
commandments
in
the
practice
of
the
counsels
of
the
holy
gospel
and
in
the
observance
of
the
monastic
rule
prepare
her
for
the
eternal
union
to
which
the
heavenly
spouse
invites
her
and
from
this
blessed
increase
of
the
flock
committed
to
your
charge
draw
a
new
motive
for
maternal
care
the
peace
of
the
lord
rest
upon
you
this
was
all
the
nuns
one
by
one
turned
and
disappeared
behind
the
wall
while
the
girl
followed
them
like
a
poor
dog
who
with
drooping
head
accompanies
at
a
distance
a
new
master
the
folding
doors
closed
durtal
remained
stupefied
looking
at
the
outline
of
the
white
bishop
the
backs
of
the
priests
who
were
mounting
the
steps
to
give
benediction
in
the
church
while
behind
them
came
in
tears
their
faces
in
their
handkerchiefs
the
mother
and
sister
of
the
novice
well
said
the
abbé
passing
his
arm
through
durtal
well
this
scene
is
to
my
mind
the
most
touching
alibi
of
death
that
it
is
possible
to
see
this
living
woman
who
buries
herself
in
the
most
frightful
of
tombs
for
in
it
the
flesh
continues
to
suffer
is
wonderful
i
remember
that
you
have
yourself
told
me
of
the
pressure
of
this
observance
and
i
shivered
in
thinking
of
perpetual
adoration
in
those
winter
nights
when
a
child
like
this
is
awakened
out
of
her
first
sleep
and
cast
into
the
darkness
of
a
chapel
where
unless
she
faints
from
weakness
or
terror
she
must
pray
alone
through
the
freezing
hours
on
her
knees
on
the
pavement
what
passes
in
that
conversation
with
the
unknown
that
interview
with
the
shadow
does
she
succeed
in
escaping
from
self
and
in
leaving
the
earth
in
gaining
on
the
threshold
of
eternity
the
inconceivable
spouse
or
does
the
soul
powerless
to
spring
on
high
remain
riveted
to
the
soil
we
figure
her
to
ourselves
her
face
bent
forward
her
hands
joined
making
appeal
to
herself
concentrating
herself
in
order
to
pour
herself
forth
the
better
and
we
imagine
her
thus
sickly
with
no
strength
left
trying
to
set
her
soul
on
fire
in
a
shivering
frame
but
who
can
tell
if
on
certain
nights
she
attains
to
it
ah
those
poor
lamps
of
exhausted
oil
of
flames
almost
dead
which
tremble
in
the
obscurity
of
the
sanctuary
what
will
god
make
of
them
then
there
was
the
family
present
at
the
taking
the
habit
and
if
the
daughter
filled
me
with
enthusiasm
i
could
not
restrain
myself
from
pitying
the
mother
think
if
the
daughter
died
the
mother
would
embrace
her
would
perhaps
speak
to
her
or
if
she
did
not
recognize
her
it
would
at
least
not
be
with
her
own
good
will
but
in
this
case
it
is
not
the
body
but
the
very
soul
of
her
child
that
dies
before
her
eyes
of
her
own
accord
her
child
knows
her
no
longer
it
is
the
contemptuous
end
of
an
affection
you
will
admit
that
for
a
mother
this
is
very
hard
yes
but
this
ingratitude
gained
at
the
price
of
god
knows
what
struggles
is
it
not
even
apart
from
the
divine
vocation
the
most
equitable
repartition
of
human
love
think
that
this
elect
creature
becomes
the
scapegoat
of
sins
committed
and
like
a
lamentable
daughter
of
danaus
she
will
unceasingly
pour
the
offering
of
her
mortifications
and
prayers
of
her
vigils
and
fastings
into
the
bottomless
vessel
of
offences
and
crimes
ah
if
you
knew
what
it
was
to
repair
the
sins
of
the
world
in
regard
to
this
i
remember
that
one
day
the
abbess
of
the
benedictines
in
the
rue
tournefort
said
to
me
our
tears
are
not
holy
enough
nor
our
souls
pure
enough
god
makes
trial
of
us
in
our
bodies
here
are
long
illnesses
which
can
not
be
cured
illnesses
which
doctors
fail
to
understand
and
we
make
thus
much
expiation
for
others
but
if
you
will
think
over
the
ceremony
which
is
just
ended
you
need
not
be
affected
beyond
measure
or
compare
it
to
the
ceremonies
of
a
funeral
the
postulant
whom
you
saw
has
not
yet
pronounced
her
final
vows
she
can
if
she
choose
leave
the
convent
and
return
to
her
own
home
at
present
she
is
in
regard
to
her
mother
a
child
in
a
foreign
country
a
child
at
school
but
she
is
not
a
dead
child
you
may
say
what
you
please
but
there
is
a
tragedy
in
that
door
which
closed
upon
her
therefore
in
the
benedictine
convent
in
the
rue
tournefort
the
scene
takes
place
in
the
interior
of
the
convent
and
the
family
is
not
present
the
mother
is
spared
but
mitigated
thus
the
ceremony
is
but
a
mere
form
almost
a
foolish
rule
in
the
seclusion
wherein
the
faith
is
hidden
those
nuns
are
also
benedictines
of
the
perpetual
adoration
are
they
not
yes
do
you
know
their
convent
and
as
durtal
shook
his
head
the
abbé
continued
it
is
older
but
less
interesting
than
that
in
the
rue
monsieur
the
chapel
is
mean
full
of
plaster
statuettes
cotton
flowers
bunches
of
grapes
and
ears
of
corn
in
gold
paper
but
the
old
building
of
the
nunnery
is
curious
it
contains
what
shall
i
call
it
a
school
and
a
retreatant
and
so
gives
at
once
the
impression
of
old
age
and
childhood
i
know
that
class
of
convents
said
durtal
i
used
often
to
see
one
when
i
used
to
visit
an
old
aunt
at
versailles
it
always
used
to
impress
me
as
a
maison
vauquer
brought
to
devotional
uses
it
had
the
air
at
once
of
a
in
the
rue
de
la
clef
and
the
sacristy
of
a
country
church
just
so
and
the
abbé
went
on
with
a
smile
i
had
many
interviews
with
the
abbess
in
the
rue
tournefort
you
guess
at
rather
than
see
her
for
you
are
separated
from
her
by
a
screen
of
black
wood
behind
which
is
stretched
a
black
curtain
which
she
draws
aside
i
can
see
it
thought
durtal
who
remembering
the
benedictine
custom
saw
in
a
second
a
little
face
confused
in
neutral
tinted
light
and
lower
at
the
top
of
her
habit
the
gleam
of
a
medal
of
the
blessed
sacrament
in
red
enamelled
in
white
he
laughed
and
said
to
the
abbé
i
laugh
because
having
had
some
business
to
transact
with
my
nun
aunt
of
whom
i
was
speaking
only
visible
like
your
abbess
through
a
trellis
i
found
out
how
to
read
her
thoughts
a
little
ah
how
was
that
in
this
way
since
i
could
not
see
her
face
which
was
hidden
behind
the
lattice
of
her
cage
and
disappeared
behind
her
veil
and
if
she
should
answer
me
having
nothing
to
guide
me
but
the
inflexions
of
her
voice
always
circumspect
and
always
calm
i
ended
by
trusting
only
to
her
great
glasses
round
with
buff
frames
which
almost
all
nuns
wear
well
all
the
repressed
vivacity
of
this
woman
burst
out
there
suddenly
in
a
corner
of
her
glasses
there
was
a
glimmer
and
i
then
understood
that
her
eye
had
lighted
up
and
gave
the
lie
to
the
indifference
of
her
voice
the
determined
quietness
of
her
tone
the
abbé
in
his
turn
began
to
laugh
do
you
know
the
superior
of
the
benedictines
in
the
rue
monsieur
said
durtal
i
have
spoken
with
her
once
or
twice
there
the
parlour
is
monastic
there
is
not
the
provincial
and
side
of
the
rue
tournefort
it
is
composed
of
a
sombre
room
of
which
all
the
breadth
at
the
end
is
taken
up
by
an
iron
grating
and
behind
the
grating
are
again
wooden
bars
and
a
shutter
painted
black
you
are
quite
in
the
dark
and
the
abbess
scarcely
in
the
light
appears
to
you
like
a
phantom
the
abbess
is
i
suppose
the
nun
elderly
fragile
and
very
short
to
whom
dom
etienne
committed
the
novice
yes
she
is
a
remarkable
shepherdess
of
souls
and
what
is
more
a
very
well
educated
woman
of
most
distinguished
manners
oh
thought
durtal
i
can
imagine
that
these
abbesses
are
charming
but
also
terrible
women
saint
teresa
was
goodness
itself
but
when
she
speaks
in
her
of
perfection
of
nuns
who
band
themselves
together
to
discuss
the
will
of
their
mother
she
shows
herself
inexorable
for
she
declares
that
perpetual
imprisonment
should
be
inflicted
on
them
as
soon
as
possible
and
without
flinching
and
in
fact
she
is
right
for
every
disorderly
sister
infects
the
flock
and
gives
the
rot
to
souls
thus
talking
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
rue
de
sèvres
and
the
abbé
stopped
to
rest
ah
he
said
as
if
speaking
to
himself
had
i
not
had
all
my
life
heavy
expenses
first
a
brother
then
nephews
to
maintain
i
should
many
years
ago
have
become
a
member
of
saint
benedict
family
i
have
always
had
an
attraction
towards
that
grand
order
which
is
in
fact
the
intellectual
order
of
the
church
therefore
when
i
was
stronger
and
younger
i
always
went
for
my
retreats
to
one
of
their
monasteries
sometimes
to
the
black
monks
of
solesmes
or
of
ligugé
who
have
preserved
the
wise
traditions
of
saint
maurus
sometimes
to
the
cistercians
or
the
white
monks
of
la
trappe
true
said
durtal
la
trappe
is
one
of
the
great
branches
of
the
tree
of
saint
benedict
but
how
is
it
that
its
ordinances
do
not
differ
from
those
which
the
patriarch
left
that
is
to
say
that
the
trappists
interpret
the
rule
of
saint
benedict
which
is
very
broad
and
supple
less
in
its
spirit
than
in
its
letter
while
the
benedictines
do
the
contrary
in
fact
la
trappe
is
an
offshoot
of
citeaux
and
is
much
more
the
daughter
of
saint
bernard
who
was
during
forty
years
the
very
sap
of
that
branch
than
the
descendant
of
saint
benedict
but
so
far
as
i
remember
the
trappists
are
themselves
divided
and
do
not
live
under
a
uniform
discipline
they
do
so
now
since
a
pontifical
brief
dated
march
sanctioned
the
decisions
of
the
general
chapter
of
the
trappists
assembled
in
rome
and
ordered
the
fusion
into
one
sole
order
and
under
the
direction
of
a
sole
superior
of
the
three
observances
of
the
trappists
who
were
in
fact
ruled
by
discordant
constitutions
and
seeing
that
durtal
was
listening
attentively
the
abbé
continued
among
these
three
observances
one
only
that
of
the
cistercian
trappists
to
which
belonged
the
abbey
of
which
i
was
a
guest
followed
in
their
integrity
the
rules
of
the
twelfth
century
and
led
the
monastic
life
of
saint
bernard
day
this
alone
recognized
the
rule
of
saint
benedict
taken
in
its
strictest
application
and
completed
by
the
charte
de
charité
and
the
use
and
customs
of
citeaux
the
two
others
had
adopted
the
same
rule
but
revised
and
modified
in
the
seventeenth
century
by
the
abbé
de
rancé
and
again
one
of
them
the
belgian
congregation
had
changed
the
statutes
imposed
by
that
abbot
at
the
present
day
as
i
have
just
said
all
the
trappists
form
only
one
and
the
same
institute
under
the
name
order
of
reformed
cistercians
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
of
la
trappe
and
all
resume
the
rules
of
citeaux
and
live
again
the
life
of
the
cenobites
of
the
middle
ages
but
if
you
have
visited
these
ascetics
said
durtal
you
must
know
dom
etienne
no
i
have
never
stayed
at
la
grande
trappe
i
prefer
the
poor
and
small
monasteries
where
one
is
mixed
up
with
the
monks
to
those
imposing
convents
where
they
isolate
you
in
a
and
in
a
word
keep
you
separate
there
is
one
in
which
i
make
my
retreats
notre
dame
de
a
small
trappist
monastery
a
few
leagues
from
paris
which
is
quite
the
most
seductive
of
shelters
besides
that
the
lord
really
abides
there
for
it
has
true
saints
among
its
children
it
is
delightful
also
with
its
ponds
its
immemorial
trees
its
distant
solitude
far
in
the
woods
yes
but
observed
durtal
the
life
there
must
be
unbending
for
la
trappe
is
the
most
rigid
order
which
has
been
imposed
on
men
for
his
only
answer
the
abbé
let
go
durtal
arm
and
took
both
his
hands
do
you
know
he
said
looking
him
in
the
face
it
is
there
you
must
go
for
your
conversion
are
you
serious
monsieur
and
as
the
priest
pressed
his
hands
more
strongly
durtal
cried
ah
no
indeed
first
i
have
not
the
stoutness
of
soul
and
if
that
be
possible
i
have
still
less
the
bodily
health
needed
for
such
a
course
i
should
fall
ill
on
my
arrival
and
then
and
then
and
then
what
i
am
not
proposing
to
you
to
shut
you
up
for
ever
in
a
cloister
so
i
suppose
said
durtal
in
a
somewhat
piqued
tone
but
just
to
remain
a
week
just
the
necessary
time
for
a
cure
now
a
week
is
soon
over
then
do
you
think
that
if
you
make
such
a
resolution
god
will
not
sustain
you
that
is
all
very
fine
but
let
us
speak
on
the
health
question
then
and
the
abbé
smiled
a
smile
of
pity
that
was
a
little
contemptuous
i
can
promise
you
at
once
that
as
a
retreatant
you
will
not
be
bound
to
lead
the
life
of
a
trappist
in
its
austerest
sense
you
need
not
get
up
at
two
in
the
morning
for
matins
but
at
three
or
even
at
four
according
to
the
day
and
smiling
at
the
face
durtal
made
the
abbé
went
on
as
to
your
food
it
will
be
better
than
that
of
the
monks
naturally
you
will
have
no
fish
nor
meat
but
you
may
certainly
have
an
egg
for
dinner
if
vegetables
are
not
enough
for
you
and
the
vegetables
i
suppose
are
cooked
with
salt
and
water
and
no
seasoning
no
they
are
dressed
with
salt
and
water
only
on
fasting
days
at
other
times
you
will
have
them
cooked
in
milk
and
water
or
in
oil
many
thanks
said
durtal
but
all
that
is
excellent
for
your
health
continued
the
priest
you
complain
of
pains
in
the
stomach
sick
headaches
diarrhoea
well
this
diet
in
the
country
in
the
air
will
cure
you
better
than
all
the
drugs
you
take
now
let
us
leave
if
you
like
your
body
out
of
the
question
for
in
such
a
case
it
is
god
part
to
act
against
your
weakness
i
tell
you
you
will
not
be
ill
at
la
trappe
that
were
absurd
it
would
be
to
send
the
penitent
sinner
away
and
jesus
would
not
then
be
the
christ
but
let
us
talk
of
your
soul
have
the
courage
to
take
its
measure
to
look
it
well
in
the
face
do
you
see
that
said
the
abbé
after
a
silence
durtal
did
not
answer
admit
said
the
priest
that
you
are
horrified
at
it
they
took
a
few
steps
in
the
street
and
the
abbé
continued
you
declare
that
you
are
sustained
by
the
crowds
of
notre
dame
des
victoires
and
the
emanations
of
severin
what
will
it
be
then
in
the
humble
chapel
when
you
will
be
on
the
ground
huddled
together
with
the
saints
i
guarantee
you
in
the
name
of
the
lord
an
assistance
such
as
you
have
never
had
and
he
went
on
with
a
laugh
i
may
add
that
the
church
will
take
pleasure
in
receiving
you
she
will
bring
out
her
ornaments
which
she
has
now
left
off
the
authentic
liturgies
of
the
middle
ages
true
plain
chant
without
solos
or
organs
listen
your
propositions
astound
me
said
durtal
with
an
effort
no
i
assure
you
i
am
not
at
all
disposed
to
imprison
myself
in
such
a
place
i
know
well
that
at
paris
i
shall
never
come
to
any
good
i
swear
to
you
that
i
am
not
proud
of
my
life
nor
satisfied
with
my
soul
but
from
thence
to
where
i
can
not
tell
i
want
at
least
a
mitigated
asylum
a
quiet
convent
there
must
be
on
those
conditions
somewhere
hospitals
for
souls
i
could
only
send
you
to
the
jesuits
who
make
a
specialty
of
retreats
for
men
but
knowing
you
as
i
think
i
know
you
i
feel
sure
you
would
not
stay
there
two
days
you
would
find
yourself
among
amiable
and
very
clever
priests
but
they
would
overwhelm
you
with
sermons
would
wish
to
interfere
with
your
life
mix
themselves
up
with
your
art
they
would
examine
your
thoughts
with
a
magnifying
glass
and
then
you
would
be
under
treatment
with
good
young
people
whose
unintelligent
piety
would
horrify
you
and
you
would
flee
in
exasperation
at
la
trappe
it
is
the
contrary
you
would
certainly
be
the
sole
retreatant
there
and
no
one
will
have
the
least
idea
of
troubling
himself
about
you
you
will
be
free
you
can
if
you
choose
leave
the
monastery
just
as
you
entered
it
without
having
confessed
or
approached
the
sacraments
your
will
will
be
respected
there
and
no
monk
will
attempt
to
sound
it
without
your
authority
to
you
only
it
will
appertain
to
decide
whether
you
will
be
converted
or
no
and
you
will
like
me
to
be
frank
to
the
last
will
you
not
you
are
as
indeed
i
have
already
said
to
you
a
sensitive
and
distrustful
man
well
the
priest
as
you
see
him
in
paris
even
the
religious
not
cloistered
seem
to
you
how
shall
i
express
it
second
rate
souls
not
to
go
further
durtal
protested
vaguely
with
a
gesture
let
me
go
on
an
afterthought
will
come
to
you
in
regard
to
the
ecclesiastic
to
whom
will
fall
the
task
of
cleansing
you
you
will
be
quite
certain
that
he
is
not
a
saint
this
is
not
very
theological
for
were
he
even
the
worst
of
priests
his
absolution
would
have
just
the
same
value
if
you
merit
it
but
indeed
here
is
a
question
of
sentiment
which
i
respect
you
will
think
of
him
in
a
word
he
lives
as
i
do
he
is
not
more
than
i
am
nothing
shows
that
his
conscience
is
very
superior
to
mine
and
thence
to
losing
all
confidence
and
throwing
up
the
whole
thing
there
is
but
a
step
at
la
trappe
i
will
defy
you
to
reason
in
this
way
and
not
to
become
humble
when
you
see
men
who
after
having
abandoned
everything
to
serve
god
lead
a
life
of
privations
and
penance
such
as
no
government
would
dare
to
inflict
on
its
convicts
you
will
indeed
be
obliged
to
admit
that
you
are
no
great
thing
by
their
side
durtal
was
silent
after
the
astonishment
he
had
felt
at
the
suggestion
of
such
an
issue
he
became
dully
irritated
against
this
friend
who
hitherto
so
discreet
had
suddenly
rushed
upon
his
soul
and
opened
it
by
force
there
came
out
the
disgusting
vision
of
an
existence
stripped
used
up
reduced
to
a
state
of
dust
a
condition
of
rags
and
durtal
shrank
from
himself
convinced
that
the
abbé
was
right
that
he
must
at
any
rate
stanch
the
discharge
of
his
senses
and
expiate
their
inappeasable
desires
their
abominable
covetousness
their
rotten
tastes
and
he
was
seized
with
a
terror
irrational
and
intense
he
had
the
giddy
fear
of
the
cloister
a
terror
which
attracted
him
to
the
abyss
over
which
gévresin
made
him
lean
enervated
by
the
ceremony
of
taking
the
habit
stunned
by
the
blow
with
which
the
priest
had
assailed
him
as
they
left
the
church
he
now
felt
an
anguish
almost
physical
in
which
everything
ended
in
confusion
he
did
not
know
to
what
reflections
he
should
give
himself
and
only
saw
swimming
on
this
whirlpool
of
troubled
ideas
one
clear
thought
that
the
moment
had
come
so
dreaded
by
him
in
which
he
must
make
a
resolution
the
abbé
looked
at
him
saw
that
he
was
really
suffering
and
was
full
of
pity
for
a
soul
so
unable
to
support
a
struggle
he
took
durtal
arm
and
said
gently
my
son
believe
me
that
the
day
you
go
yourself
to
the
house
of
god
the
day
you
knock
at
its
door
it
will
open
wide
and
the
angels
will
draw
aside
to
let
you
pass
the
gospel
can
not
lie
and
it
declares
that
there
is
more
joy
over
one
sinner
that
repents
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
persons
who
need
no
repentance
you
will
be
much
better
welcomed
than
you
expect
and
be
sufficiently
my
friend
to
think
that
the
old
priest
you
leave
here
will
not
remain
inactive
and
that
he
and
the
convents
he
can
influence
will
pray
their
best
for
you
i
will
see
said
durtal
really
moved
by
the
affectionate
tone
of
the
priest
i
will
see
i
can
not
decide
thus
unexpectedly
i
will
think
ah
it
is
not
simple
above
all
things
pray
said
the
priest
who
had
reached
his
door
i
have
on
my
side
sought
the
lord
much
that
he
would
enlighten
me
and
i
declare
to
you
that
the
solution
of
la
trappe
is
the
only
one
he
has
given
me
ask
him
humbly
in
your
turn
and
you
will
be
guided
i
shall
soon
see
you
again
shall
i
not
he
pressed
durtal
hand
who
left
alone
recovered
himself
at
last
then
he
recalled
the
strategic
smiles
the
ambiguous
phrases
the
dreamy
silences
of
the
abbé
gévresin
he
understood
the
kindness
of
his
counsels
the
patience
of
his
plans
and
a
little
put
out
at
having
been
without
knowing
it
led
so
wisely
he
exclaimed
in
spite
of
himself
this
then
was
the
design
the
priest
was
ripening
with
his
air
of
not
concerning
himself
with
it
at
all
chapter
ix
he
experienced
that
painful
awakening
of
a
sick
man
whom
a
doctor
deceives
for
months
who
learns
some
fine
morning
that
he
is
to
be
taken
at
once
to
an
hospital
to
undergo
an
urgent
surgical
operation
but
that
is
not
the
way
things
should
be
done
cried
durtal
people
should
be
prepared
little
by
little
accustomed
by
words
of
warning
to
the
idea
that
they
are
to
be
cut
up
on
a
table
they
are
not
struck
down
thus
unexpectedly
yes
but
what
does
that
matter
since
i
know
very
well
in
the
depths
of
my
soul
that
this
priest
is
right
i
must
leave
paris
if
i
wish
to
amend
but
all
the
same
the
treatment
he
inflicts
is
hard
indeed
to
follow
i
know
not
what
to
do
and
from
this
moment
his
days
were
haunted
by
trappists
he
turned
over
the
thought
of
his
departure
and
examined
it
on
all
sides
chewed
the
cud
of
for
and
against
and
ended
by
saying
to
himself
that
he
would
take
stock
of
his
reflections
and
open
an
account
and
this
with
a
debit
and
credit
side
that
he
might
know
himself
the
better
the
debit
is
terrible
to
gather
up
his
life
and
cast
it
into
the
stove
of
a
cloister
and
again
he
ought
to
know
if
his
body
were
in
a
state
to
bear
such
a
remedy
mine
is
frail
and
soft
accustomed
to
rise
late
it
becomes
weak
if
not
nourished
by
flesh
meat
and
is
subject
to
neuralgia
at
any
change
of
the
hour
of
meals
i
should
never
be
able
to
hold
out
down
there
with
vegetables
cooked
in
warm
oil
or
in
milk
first
i
detest
oily
cookery
and
i
hate
milk
still
more
which
i
can
not
digest
then
i
think
i
see
myself
on
my
knees
on
the
floor
for
hours
i
who
suffered
so
much
at
la
glacière
in
remaining
in
that
posture
on
a
step
for
scarce
a
quarter
of
an
hour
again
i
am
so
accustomed
to
cigarettes
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
give
them
up
and
it
is
pretty
certain
they
will
not
let
me
smoke
in
a
monastery
no
indeed
from
the
bodily
point
of
view
this
plan
is
madness
in
my
state
of
health
there
is
no
doctor
who
would
not
dissuade
me
from
undertaking
such
a
risk
if
i
place
myself
in
a
spiritual
point
of
view
i
must
then
again
recognize
that
it
is
terrible
to
enter
la
trappe
i
am
afraid
indeed
that
my
dryness
of
soul
my
want
of
love
will
remain
and
then
what
would
become
of
me
in
such
surroundings
then
it
is
equally
probable
that
in
that
solitude
and
absolute
silence
i
should
be
wearied
to
death
and
if
it
be
so
what
a
miserable
existence
is
it
to
stalk
about
a
cell
and
count
the
hours
no
for
that
one
needs
to
be
firmly
fixed
on
god
to
be
dwelt
in
wholly
by
him
moreover
there
are
two
formidable
questions
which
i
have
never
properly
weighed
because
it
has
been
painful
to
think
of
them
but
now
that
they
come
before
me
and
stop
the
road
i
must
face
them
the
questions
of
confession
and
holy
communion
confession
yes
i
will
consent
to
it
i
am
so
tired
of
myself
so
disgusted
with
my
wretched
existence
that
this
expiation
appears
to
me
as
deserved
even
necessary
i
desire
to
humble
myself
i
would
ask
pardon
with
all
my
heart
but
again
this
penance
must
be
assigned
me
under
possible
conditions
at
la
trappe
if
i
believe
the
abbé
no
one
will
trouble
himself
about
me
in
other
words
no
one
will
encourage
me
and
aid
me
to
submit
to
this
sorrowful
extraction
of
my
shames
i
shall
be
somewhat
like
a
sick
man
operated
on
in
hospital
far
from
his
friends
and
relatives
confession
he
went
on
is
an
admirable
discovery
for
it
is
the
most
sensitive
touchstone
of
souls
the
most
intolerable
act
which
the
church
has
ever
imposed
on
the
vanity
of
men
is
this
strange
we
speak
easily
of
our
lapses
of
our
grosser
actions
even
indeed
to
a
priest
in
conversation
that
does
not
seem
to
lead
to
any
consequences
and
perhaps
a
little
bragging
enters
into
our
admission
of
easy
sins
but
to
tell
the
same
thing
on
one
knees
accusing
oneself
after
prayer
is
different
that
which
was
only
rather
amusing
becomes
a
very
painful
humiliation
for
the
soul
is
not
the
dupe
of
this
false
seeming
it
knows
so
well
in
its
inner
tribunal
that
all
is
changed
it
feels
so
well
the
terrible
power
of
the
sacrament
that
he
who
but
now
smiled
now
trembles
at
the
very
thought
now
were
i
to
find
myself
face
to
face
with
an
old
monk
who
emerges
from
an
eternity
of
silence
to
listen
to
me
a
monk
who
will
not
aid
me
perhaps
can
not
even
understand
me
this
will
be
terrible
i
shall
never
get
to
the
end
of
my
troubles
if
he
does
not
hold
out
a
staff
to
me
if
he
lets
me
stifle
and
gives
no
air
to
my
soul
nor
brings
me
help
the
eucharist
also
seems
terrible
to
dare
to
come
forward
to
offer
him
as
a
tabernacle
the
sewer
of
self
scarce
purified
by
repentance
a
sewer
drained
by
absolution
but
still
hardly
dry
is
monstrous
i
am
quite
without
such
courage
as
to
offer
christ
this
last
insult
and
so
there
is
no
good
in
fleeing
to
a
monastery
no
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
am
obliged
to
conclude
that
i
should
be
mad
if
i
ventured
into
a
trappist
house
now
for
the
credit
side
the
only
proper
work
of
my
life
would
be
to
make
a
parcel
of
my
life
and
take
it
to
a
cloister
to
disinfect
it
and
if
that
cost
me
nothing
where
is
the
merit
nothing
shows
me
on
the
other
hand
that
my
body
however
weakened
can
not
support
the
regimen
of
la
trappe
without
believing
or
pretending
to
believe
with
the
abbé
gévresin
that
that
kind
of
food
will
be
even
helpful
to
me
i
ought
to
count
on
divine
consolations
to
admit
the
principle
that
if
i
am
sent
there
it
is
not
that
i
may
take
at
once
to
my
bed
or
be
obliged
to
leave
again
as
soon
as
i
arrive
at
least
unless
that
is
the
chastisement
prepared
me
the
expiation
demanded
and
again
no
for
that
would
be
to
ascribe
to
god
pitiless
tricks
and
would
be
absurd
as
to
the
cookery
it
matters
little
that
it
is
uncivilized
if
my
stomach
can
digest
it
to
have
bad
food
and
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
is
nothing
provided
the
body
can
stand
it
and
no
doubt
i
shall
find
some
means
of
smoking
cigarettes
by
stealth
in
the
woods
after
all
a
week
is
soon
over
and
i
am
not
even
obliged
if
i
feel
poorly
to
remain
a
week
from
the
spiritual
point
of
view
i
must
again
count
on
the
mercy
of
god
believe
that
it
will
not
abandon
me
will
dress
my
wounds
and
change
the
very
foundation
of
my
soul
i
know
well
that
these
arguments
do
not
rest
on
any
earthly
certainty
but
yet
if
i
have
proofs
that
providence
has
already
taken
part
in
my
affairs
i
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
these
arguments
are
weaker
than
the
purely
physical
motives
which
served
to
support
my
other
thesis
now
i
must
recall
that
conversion
so
outside
my
will
i
must
take
account
of
a
fact
which
should
encourage
me
the
weakness
of
the
temptations
which
i
now
experience
it
is
difficult
to
have
been
more
rapidly
and
more
completely
heard
whether
i
owe
this
grace
to
my
own
prayers
or
to
those
of
the
convents
which
have
shielded
me
without
knowing
me
it
is
the
case
that
for
some
time
past
my
brain
has
been
silent
and
my
flesh
calm
that
monster
florence
appears
to
me
still
at
certain
times
but
she
does
not
approach
me
she
remains
in
the
shade
and
the
end
of
the
lord
prayer
the
nos
inducas
in
tentationem
puts
her
to
flight
that
is
an
unaccustomed
fact
and
yet
a
precise
one
why
should
i
doubt
then
that
i
shall
be
better
upheld
at
la
trappe
than
i
am
in
paris
itself
there
remain
confession
and
communion
confession
it
will
be
what
the
lord
chooses
it
should
be
he
will
choose
the
monk
for
me
i
shall
only
be
able
to
make
use
of
him
and
then
the
more
disagreeable
it
is
the
better
worth
it
will
be
and
if
i
suffer
much
i
shall
think
myself
less
unworthy
to
communicate
that
is
he
went
on
the
most
painful
point
communicate
but
let
us
consider
it
is
certain
that
i
shall
be
base
in
proposing
to
christ
that
he
should
descend
like
a
scavenger
into
my
ditch
but
if
i
wait
till
it
is
empty
i
shall
never
be
in
a
state
to
receive
him
for
my
bulkheads
are
not
closed
and
sins
would
filter
through
the
fissures
all
this
well
considered
the
abbé
spoke
truth
when
he
answered
me
one
day
i
too
am
not
worthy
to
approach
him
thank
god
i
have
not
those
sewers
of
which
you
speak
but
in
the
morning
when
i
go
to
say
my
mass
and
think
of
all
the
dust
of
the
evening
do
you
not
think
that
i
am
ashamed
it
is
always
necessary
you
see
to
go
back
to
the
gospels
and
say
to
yourself
that
he
came
for
the
weak
and
the
sick
the
publicans
and
lepers
and
in
fact
you
must
convince
yourself
that
the
eucharist
is
a
lookout
post
a
help
that
it
is
given
as
it
is
written
in
the
ordinary
of
the
mass
ad
tutamentum
mentis
et
corporis
et
ad
medelam
percipiendam
it
is
if
i
may
say
so
a
spiritual
medicine
you
go
to
the
saviour
just
as
you
go
to
a
doctor
you
take
your
soul
to
him
to
care
for
it
and
he
does
so
i
stand
before
the
unknown
pursued
durtal
i
complain
that
i
am
arid
and
have
wandered
from
the
right
way
but
who
will
declare
to
me
that
if
i
determine
to
communicate
i
shall
remain
in
the
same
mind
for
indeed
if
i
have
faith
i
ought
to
believe
in
the
occult
work
of
christ
in
the
sacrament
lastly
i
am
afraid
of
being
wearied
by
solitude
i
am
not
much
amused
here
as
it
is
but
at
la
trappe
i
shall
no
longer
have
those
vacillations
at
every
minute
those
constant
fears
i
shall
at
least
have
the
advantage
of
having
my
time
to
myself
and
then
and
then
how
well
i
know
solitude
have
i
not
lived
apart
since
the
deaths
of
des
hermies
and
carhaix
indeed
whom
do
i
see
a
few
publishers
a
few
literary
men
and
my
relations
with
these
people
are
not
interesting
as
to
silence
it
is
a
blessing
i
shall
not
hear
any
foolish
sayings
at
la
trappe
i
shall
not
listen
to
pitiable
homilies
and
poor
sermons
but
i
ought
to
rejoice
on
being
at
last
isolated
far
from
paris
far
from
men
he
was
silent
and
made
as
it
were
a
return
in
upon
himself
and
said
to
himself
in
a
melancholy
manner
these
strifes
are
useless
these
reflections
vain
i
need
not
try
to
take
account
of
my
soul
to
make
out
the
debit
and
credit
i
know
without
knowing
how
that
i
must
go
i
am
thrust
out
of
myself
by
an
impulse
which
rises
from
the
very
depths
of
my
being
to
which
i
am
quite
certain
i
have
to
yield
at
that
moment
durtal
had
decided
but
ten
minutes
afterwards
the
attempt
at
resolution
vanished
he
felt
his
cowardice
gain
on
him
once
more
he
chewed
once
more
the
cud
of
arguments
against
his
moving
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
reasons
for
remaining
in
paris
were
palpable
human
certain
while
the
others
were
intangible
and
consequently
subject
to
illusions
perhaps
false
and
he
invented
for
himself
the
fear
of
not
obtaining
the
thing
he
feared
said
to
himself
that
la
trappe
would
not
receive
him
or
certainly
that
it
would
refuse
him
communion
and
then
he
suggested
to
himself
a
middle
term
to
confess
at
paris
and
communicate
at
la
trappe
but
then
there
passed
in
him
an
incomprehensible
fact
his
whole
soul
revolted
at
this
idea
and
the
formal
order
not
to
deceive
himself
was
truly
breathed
into
him
and
he
said
to
himself
no
the
bitter
draught
must
be
drained
to
the
last
drop
it
is
all
or
nothing
if
i
confess
to
the
abbé
it
will
be
in
disobedience
to
absolute
and
secret
directions
i
should
be
capable
of
not
going
afterwards
to
notre
dame
de
what
shall
i
do
and
he
accused
himself
of
distrust
called
to
his
aid
once
more
the
memory
of
benefits
received
how
scales
had
fallen
from
his
eyes
his
insensible
progress
towards
faith
his
encounter
with
that
singular
priest
perhaps
the
only
one
who
could
understand
him
and
treat
him
in
a
way
so
benign
and
so
elastic
but
he
tried
in
vain
to
reassure
himself
then
he
called
up
the
dream
of
the
monastic
life
the
sovereign
beauty
of
the
cloister
he
imagined
the
joy
of
renunciation
the
peace
of
exalted
prayers
the
interior
intoxication
of
the
spirit
the
delight
of
not
being
at
home
any
longer
in
his
own
body
some
words
of
the
abbé
about
la
trappe
served
as
a
for
his
dreams
and
he
perceived
an
old
abbey
grey
and
warm
immense
avenues
of
trees
clouds
flying
confusedly
amid
the
song
of
waters
silent
strolls
in
the
woods
at
nightfall
he
called
up
the
solemn
liturgies
of
saint
benedict
time
he
saw
the
white
pith
of
monastic
chants
rise
under
the
scarcely
pruned
bark
of
sound
he
succeeded
in
his
decision
and
cried
you
have
dreamed
for
years
of
the
cloisters
now
rejoice
that
you
will
know
them
at
last
and
he
wished
to
go
at
once
and
live
there
then
suddenly
he
fell
down
into
reality
and
said
to
himself
it
is
easy
to
wish
to
live
in
a
monastery
to
tell
god
that
you
would
desire
to
take
shelter
therein
when
life
in
paris
weighs
you
down
but
when
it
comes
to
the
real
point
of
emigration
it
is
quite
another
matter
he
turned
over
these
thoughts
everywhere
in
the
street
at
home
in
the
chapels
he
hurried
like
a
shuttle
from
one
church
to
another
hoping
to
solace
his
fears
by
changing
his
place
but
they
persisted
and
rendered
every
place
intolerable
then
in
the
sacred
places
came
always
that
dryness
of
soul
the
broken
spring
of
impulse
a
sudden
silence
within
when
he
desired
consolation
in
speaking
to
him
his
best
moments
his
pauses
in
the
were
a
few
minutes
of
absolute
torpor
which
rested
like
snow
on
the
soul
and
he
heard
nothing
but
this
drowsiness
of
thought
lasted
but
a
while
the
whirlwind
blew
once
more
and
the
prayers
which
were
wont
to
appease
it
refused
to
leave
his
lips
he
tried
religious
music
the
despairing
sequences
of
the
psalms
pictures
of
the
crucifixion
by
the
early
masters
to
excite
him
but
his
prayers
ran
on
and
became
confused
on
his
lips
were
divested
of
all
sense
mere
words
empty
shells
at
notre
dame
des
victoires
where
he
dragged
himself
that
he
might
thaw
a
little
under
the
warmth
of
his
neighbours
prayers
he
did
in
fact
feel
less
chilly
and
seemed
to
break
up
a
little
fell
drop
by
drop
into
sorrows
which
he
could
not
formulate
and
were
all
summed
up
in
the
cry
of
a
sick
child
in
which
he
said
to
our
lady
in
low
tones
my
soul
is
sorrowful
thence
he
returned
to
severin
sat
down
under
those
arches
browned
by
the
rust
of
prayers
and
haunted
by
his
fixed
idea
he
pleaded
for
himself
extenuating
circumstances
exaggerated
the
austerities
of
la
trappe
tried
almost
to
exasperate
his
fear
to
excuse
his
weakness
in
a
vague
appeal
to
our
lady
but
i
must
go
and
see
the
abbé
gévresin
he
murmured
but
his
courage
still
failed
him
to
pronounce
the
yes
which
the
priest
would
surely
require
from
him
he
ended
by
discovering
a
reason
for
his
visit
without
thinking
himself
obliged
to
promise
just
yet
after
all
he
thought
i
have
no
precise
information
about
this
monastery
i
do
not
even
know
whether
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
take
a
long
and
expensive
journey
to
get
there
the
abbé
indeed
declares
that
it
is
not
far
from
paris
but
it
is
impossible
to
decide
on
this
simple
declaration
it
will
be
useful
also
to
know
the
habits
of
these
cenobites
before
going
to
stay
with
them
the
abbé
smiled
when
durtal
mentioned
these
objections
the
journey
is
short
he
said
you
start
from
the
gare
du
nord
at
eight
in
the
morning
for
saint
landry
where
you
arrive
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
you
lunch
at
an
inn
close
to
the
station
and
while
you
are
drinking
your
coffee
they
get
you
a
carriage
and
after
a
drive
of
four
hours
you
arrive
at
notre
dame
de
for
dinner
there
is
no
difficulty
there
then
the
cost
is
moderate
as
far
as
i
remember
the
railway
fare
is
about
fifteen
francs
add
two
or
three
francs
for
lunch
and
six
or
seven
for
the
carriage
and
as
durtal
was
silent
the
abbé
went
on
well
ah
yes
yes
if
you
knew
i
am
in
a
pitiable
state
i
will
and
will
not
i
know
well
that
i
ought
to
take
refuge
there
but
in
spite
of
myself
i
wish
to
gain
time
and
put
off
the
hour
of
departure
and
he
continued
my
soul
is
out
of
gear
when
i
would
pray
my
senses
go
all
astray
i
can
not
recollect
myself
and
if
i
succeed
in
pulling
myself
together
five
minutes
do
not
pass
but
i
am
all
astray
again
no
i
have
neither
fervour
nor
true
contrition
i
do
not
love
god
enough
if
it
must
be
said
and
indeed
during
the
last
two
days
a
frightful
certainty
has
grown
up
in
me
i
am
sure
that
in
spite
of
my
good
intentions
if
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
certain
person
whose
sight
troubles
me
i
should
send
religion
to
the
devil
i
should
return
eagerly
to
my
vomit
i
only
hold
on
because
i
am
not
tempted
i
am
no
better
than
when
i
was
sinning
you
will
admit
that
i
am
in
a
wretched
state
to
enter
a
trappist
monastery
your
reasons
are
at
least
weak
answered
the
abbé
you
say
first
that
your
prayers
are
distracted
that
you
are
unable
to
concentrate
your
attention
but
in
fact
you
are
just
like
everybody
else
even
saint
teresa
declares
that
often
she
was
unable
to
recite
the
credo
without
distraction
it
is
a
weakness
in
which
we
must
just
take
our
portion
humbly
above
all
things
it
is
necessary
not
to
lay
too
much
stress
on
these
evils
for
the
fear
of
seeing
them
return
ensures
their
assiduity
you
are
distracted
in
prayer
by
the
very
fear
of
distraction
and
by
regret
for
it
go
forth
more
boldly
look
at
things
more
widely
pray
as
best
you
can
and
do
not
trouble
yourself
again
you
declare
that
if
you
meet
a
certain
person
whose
attraction
is
a
trouble
to
you
you
will
succumb
how
do
you
know
that
why
should
you
take
care
about
seductions
which
god
does
not
yet
inflict
upon
you
and
which
he
will
perhaps
spare
you
why
doubt
his
mercy
why
not
believe
on
the
contrary
that
if
he
judge
the
temptation
useful
he
will
aid
you
enough
to
prevent
your
sinking
under
it
in
any
case
you
ought
not
by
anticipation
to
fear
disgust
at
your
weakness
the
imitation
declares
is
nothing
more
foolish
and
vain
than
to
afflict
ourselves
about
future
things
which
may
perhaps
never
happen
no
it
is
enough
to
occupy
ourselves
with
the
present
for
for
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
diei
malitia
sua
finally
you
say
you
do
not
love
god
again
i
answer
what
do
you
know
about
it
you
have
this
love
by
the
very
token
that
you
desire
to
have
it
and
that
you
regret
you
have
it
not
you
love
our
lord
by
the
very
fact
that
you
desire
to
love
him
that
is
special
pleading
murmured
durtal
but
indeed
he
went
on
suppose
at
la
trappe
the
monk
revolted
at
the
long
outrage
of
my
sins
refused
me
absolution
and
forbade
me
to
communicate
the
abbé
burst
out
laughing
you
are
mad
what
is
your
notion
of
christ
not
of
christ
but
of
his
intermediary
the
human
being
who
replaces
him
you
can
only
chance
upon
a
man
pointed
out
beforehand
from
above
to
judge
you
moreover
at
notre
dame
de
you
have
every
chance
of
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
a
saint
therefore
god
will
inspire
him
will
be
present
you
have
nothing
to
fear
as
to
the
communion
the
prospect
of
being
rejected
terrifies
you
but
is
not
that
one
proof
the
more
that
contrary
to
your
opinion
god
does
not
leave
you
insensible
yes
but
the
idea
of
communicating
alarms
me
none
the
less
i
say
to
you
again
if
jesus
were
indifferent
to
you
it
would
be
just
the
same
to
you
to
consume
or
not
to
consume
the
sacred
species
all
that
does
not
convince
me
sighed
durtal
i
do
not
know
where
i
am
i
am
afraid
of
a
confessor
of
others
of
myself
it
is
foolish
but
it
is
stronger
than
i
can
not
gain
the
upper
hand
you
are
afraid
of
the
water
imitate
gribouille
throw
yourself
in
boldly
look
suppose
i
write
to
la
trappe
this
very
day
to
say
you
are
coming
when
oh
cried
durtal
wait
a
while
to
get
an
answer
we
need
two
days
each
way
will
you
go
there
five
days
hence
and
as
durtal
was
astounded
and
silent
is
that
settled
then
at
that
moment
durtal
had
a
strange
experience
as
often
at
severin
a
sort
of
caressing
touch
and
gentle
push
he
felt
a
will
insinuate
itself
into
his
own
and
he
drew
back
disquieted
at
seeing
he
had
a
double
self
to
find
he
was
no
longer
alone
in
the
depth
of
his
being
then
he
was
inexplicably
reassured
and
gave
himself
up
and
as
soon
as
he
had
said
yes
he
felt
immensely
relieved
then
passing
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
he
was
troubled
at
the
idea
that
his
departure
could
not
take
place
at
once
and
was
sorry
that
he
had
still
to
pass
five
days
in
paris
the
abbé
laughed
but
the
trappists
must
have
notice
it
is
a
simple
formality
for
with
a
word
from
me
you
will
be
received
at
once
but
wait
at
least
until
i
have
sent
this
word
i
will
post
it
this
evening
so
have
no
anxiety
and
sleep
in
peace
durtal
in
his
turn
laughed
at
his
own
impatience
you
must
think
me
very
ridiculous
he
said
the
priest
shrugged
his
shoulders
come
you
asked
me
about
my
little
monastery
i
must
try
to
satisfy
you
it
is
very
small
if
compared
with
the
grande
trappe
at
soligny
or
the
establishments
at
sept
fonds
meilleray
or
aiguebelle
for
there
are
only
about
ten
choir
fathers
and
about
thirty
lay
brothers
or
there
are
also
a
certain
number
of
peasants
who
work
with
them
and
help
them
to
till
their
land
and
make
their
chocolate
they
make
chocolate
that
surprises
you
how
do
you
think
they
live
ah
i
warn
you
you
are
not
going
into
a
sumptuous
monastery
i
like
it
so
but
in
regard
to
the
stories
of
la
trappe
i
suppose
the
monks
do
not
greet
each
other
with
we
must
die
and
that
they
do
not
dig
their
graves
every
morning
all
that
is
false
they
take
no
trouble
about
their
graves
and
they
salute
each
other
silently
since
they
are
forbidden
to
speak
then
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
need
anything
the
abbot
the
confessor
and
the
have
the
right
of
conversing
with
the
guests
you
will
have
to
do
with
them
alone
the
others
will
bow
when
you
meet
them
but
if
you
speak
to
them
they
will
not
answer
it
is
well
to
know
that
what
is
their
dress
before
the
foundation
of
citeaux
the
benedictines
wore
or
so
it
is
supposed
the
black
habit
of
saint
benedict
the
benedictines
properly
wear
it
still
but
at
citeaux
the
colour
was
changed
and
the
trappists
who
are
a
twig
of
this
branch
have
adopted
the
white
robe
of
saint
bernard
pray
pardon
all
these
questions
which
must
seem
childish
but
since
i
am
about
to
visit
these
monks
i
ought
to
be
in
some
measure
acquainted
with
the
customs
of
their
order
i
am
wholly
at
your
disposition
replied
the
abbé
durtal
asked
him
about
the
situation
of
the
abbey
itself
and
he
replied
the
present
monastery
dates
from
the
eighteenth
century
but
you
will
see
in
the
gardens
the
ruins
of
the
old
cloister
which
was
built
in
the
time
of
saint
bernard
in
the
middle
ages
there
was
a
succession
of
blessed
in
this
convent
it
is
a
truly
sanctified
land
fit
for
meditation
and
regret
the
abbey
is
situated
at
the
bottom
of
a
valley
according
to
the
orders
of
saint
bernard
for
you
know
that
if
saint
benedict
loved
the
hills
saint
bernard
sought
the
low
and
moist
plains
wherein
to
found
his
convents
an
old
latin
line
has
preserved
the
different
tastes
of
these
two
saints
valles
colles
benedictus
amabat
was
it
on
account
of
his
own
personal
liking
or
for
a
pious
end
that
saint
bernard
built
his
hermitages
in
unwholesome
and
flat
places
in
order
that
his
monks
whose
health
was
enfeebled
by
the
fogs
might
have
constantly
before
their
eyes
the
salutary
image
of
death
the
deuce
he
did
i
may
add
at
once
that
the
valley
in
which
notre
dame
de
rises
is
now
drained
and
the
air
is
very
pure
you
will
stroll
by
delightful
ponds
and
i
may
recommend
you
on
the
borders
of
the
enclosure
an
avenue
of
secular
chestnuts
where
you
may
take
some
refreshing
walks
at
daybreak
and
after
a
silence
the
abbé
gévresin
continued
walk
there
a
good
deal
traverse
the
woods
in
all
directions
the
forests
will
tell
you
more
about
your
soul
than
books
amplius
invenies
in
sylvis
quam
in
libris
wrote
saint
bernard
and
your
days
will
seem
short
durtal
went
away
from
the
priest
house
comforted
almost
joyful
he
felt
at
least
the
solace
of
a
fixed
decision
a
resolution
taken
at
last
he
said
to
himself
that
the
only
thing
now
to
be
done
was
to
prepare
himself
as
best
he
could
for
the
retreat
and
he
prayed
and
went
to
bed
for
the
first
time
for
months
with
his
mind
at
rest
but
next
day
when
he
woke
his
mood
changed
all
his
preconceived
ideas
all
his
fears
returned
he
asked
himself
if
his
conversion
were
ripe
enough
to
allow
him
to
cut
it
separate
and
carry
it
to
la
trappe
the
fear
of
a
confessor
the
dread
of
the
unknown
assailed
him
afresh
i
was
wrong
to
have
answered
so
soon
and
he
asked
himself
why
did
i
say
the
recollection
of
this
word
pronounced
by
his
lips
conceived
by
a
will
which
was
still
his
own
and
yet
other
than
his
came
back
to
his
mind
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
such
a
thing
happened
to
me
he
thought
i
have
already
experienced
when
alone
in
the
churches
unexpected
counsels
silent
orders
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
terrifying
to
feel
this
infusion
into
self
of
an
invisible
being
and
to
know
that
he
can
if
he
choose
almost
turn
you
out
of
the
domain
of
your
personality
but
no
it
is
not
that
there
is
no
substitution
of
an
exterior
will
to
one
own
for
one
free
will
is
absolutely
intact
neither
is
it
one
of
those
irresistible
impulses
endured
by
certain
sick
persons
for
nothing
is
more
easy
than
to
resist
it
it
is
still
less
a
suggestion
since
in
this
case
there
are
no
magnetic
passes
no
somnambulism
induced
no
hypnotism
no
it
is
the
irresistible
entrance
into
oneself
of
a
strange
will
the
sudden
intrusion
of
a
precise
and
discreet
desire
a
pressure
on
the
soul
at
once
firm
and
gentle
ah
again
i
am
incorrect
and
play
the
fool
but
nothing
can
describe
that
close
pressure
which
vanishes
at
the
least
movement
of
impatience
it
is
felt
but
can
not
be
expressed
its
introduction
is
always
attended
by
surprise
almost
with
anguish
since
it
does
not
make
use
of
even
an
interior
voice
to
make
itself
heard
and
is
formulated
without
the
aid
of
words
all
is
blotted
out
the
breath
which
has
thrilled
you
disappears
you
would
wish
that
this
incitement
should
be
confirmed
that
the
phenomenon
should
be
repeated
in
order
to
be
more
closely
observed
to
try
to
analyze
it
and
understand
it
when
lo
it
is
gone
you
remain
alone
with
yourself
are
free
not
to
obey
your
will
is
unfettered
and
you
know
it
but
you
know
also
that
if
you
reject
these
invitations
you
take
on
yourself
unspeakable
risks
for
the
future
in
fact
pursued
durtal
it
is
an
angelic
influx
a
divine
touch
something
analogous
to
the
interior
voice
so
well
known
by
the
mystics
but
it
is
less
complete
less
precise
and
yet
it
is
quite
as
certain
he
ended
his
dreams
concluding
i
am
consumed
and
collared
by
myself
before
being
able
to
answer
this
priest
whose
arguments
would
scarce
persuade
me
unless
i
had
had
this
help
this
unexpected
succour
but
then
since
i
am
thus
led
by
the
hand
what
have
i
to
fear
he
feared
all
the
same
and
could
not
be
at
peace
with
himself
then
if
he
profited
by
the
comfort
of
a
decision
he
was
consumed
for
the
moment
by
the
expectation
of
his
departure
he
tried
to
kill
time
in
reading
but
he
had
to
admit
once
more
that
he
could
not
expect
consolation
from
any
book
none
came
even
distantly
into
relation
with
his
state
of
mind
high
mysticism
was
so
little
human
soared
at
such
heights
far
from
our
mire
that
no
sovereign
aid
could
be
expected
from
it
he
ended
by
falling
back
on
the
imitation
in
which
mysticism
placed
within
the
reach
of
the
crowd
was
like
a
trembling
and
plaintive
friend
who
stanched
your
wounds
within
the
cells
of
its
chapters
prayed
and
wept
with
you
and
in
any
case
compassionated
the
desolate
widowhood
of
souls
unfortunately
durtal
had
read
so
much
and
was
so
saturated
with
the
gospels
that
he
had
temporarily
exhausted
their
sedative
and
soothing
virtues
tired
of
reading
he
again
began
his
courses
in
the
churches
and
suppose
the
trappists
will
not
have
me
he
thought
what
will
become
of
me
but
i
tell
you
that
they
will
receive
you
said
the
abbé
whom
he
went
to
see
he
was
not
easy
till
the
day
the
priest
handed
him
the
answer
from
la
trappe
he
read
we
will
receive
with
pleasure
for
a
week
in
our
the
retreatant
whom
you
wish
to
commend
to
us
and
i
do
not
see
at
the
moment
any
reason
why
the
retreat
should
not
begin
next
tuesday
in
the
hope
monsieur
that
we
shall
also
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
in
our
solitude
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
i
am
yours
most
respectfully
etienne
he
read
and
it
at
once
delighted
and
terrified
there
is
no
further
doubt
it
is
irrevocable
he
said
and
he
went
at
once
in
haste
to
severin
having
less
need
of
prayer
than
of
going
near
to
our
lady
of
showing
himself
to
her
paying
her
as
it
were
a
visit
of
thankfulness
and
expressing
his
gratitude
by
his
very
presence
he
was
taken
by
the
charms
of
that
church
its
silence
the
shadow
which
fell
on
the
apse
from
the
height
of
its
palm
trees
of
stone
and
he
ended
by
caring
for
nothing
and
sinking
on
a
chair
filled
with
one
sole
desire
not
to
enter
again
on
the
life
of
the
streets
never
to
leave
his
refuge
never
to
move
the
next
day
which
was
a
sunday
he
went
to
the
benedictine
nuns
to
hear
high
mass
a
black
monk
celebrated
he
recognized
a
benedictine
when
the
priest
chanted
dominous
vobiscoum
for
the
abbé
gévresin
had
told
him
that
the
benedictines
pronounced
latin
like
italian
though
he
was
not
inclined
to
like
that
pronunciation
which
took
away
from
latin
the
sonorous
tones
of
its
words
and
turned
after
a
fashion
the
phrases
of
that
tongue
into
a
ring
of
bells
with
their
clappers
muffled
or
their
vases
stuffed
with
tow
he
let
himself
go
taken
hold
of
by
the
unction
by
the
humble
piety
of
the
monk
who
almost
trembled
with
reverence
and
joy
when
he
kissed
the
altar
and
he
had
a
deep
voice
to
which
behind
the
grating
answered
the
clear
high
voices
of
the
nuns
durtal
panted
listening
to
the
fluid
pictures
of
the
early
masters
sketch
and
form
and
paint
themselves
on
the
air
he
was
affected
to
his
very
marrow
as
he
had
formerly
been
during
high
mass
at
severin
he
had
lost
that
emotion
now
in
that
church
where
the
flower
of
melody
had
faded
for
him
since
he
knew
the
benedictine
plain
song
and
he
now
found
it
again
or
rather
he
took
it
with
him
from
severin
to
this
chapel
and
for
the
first
time
he
had
a
wild
desire
a
desire
so
violent
that
it
seemed
to
melt
his
heart
it
was
at
the
moment
of
the
communion
the
monk
elevating
the
host
uttered
the
domine
non
sum
dignus
pale
with
drawn
features
sorrowful
eyes
and
serious
mouth
he
seemed
to
have
escaped
from
a
monastery
of
the
middle
ages
cut
out
of
one
of
those
flemish
pictures
where
the
monks
are
standing
in
the
background
while
before
them
nuns
are
praying
on
their
knees
with
joined
hands
near
the
donors
to
the
child
jesus
on
whom
the
virgin
smiles
while
lowering
her
long
lashes
under
her
arching
brow
and
while
he
descended
the
steps
and
communicated
two
women
durtal
trembled
and
his
desires
went
forth
towards
the
ciborium
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
were
nourished
on
that
bread
there
would
be
an
end
of
all
his
dryness
and
all
his
fears
it
would
seem
to
him
that
the
wall
of
his
sins
higher
and
higher
from
year
to
year
and
now
barring
his
view
would
roll
away
and
at
last
he
would
see
and
he
was
in
haste
to
set
off
for
la
trappe
that
he
too
might
receive
the
sacred
body
from
the
hands
of
a
monk
that
mass
gave
him
new
strength
like
a
tonic
he
came
out
of
the
chapel
joyful
and
firmer
and
when
the
impression
grew
somewhat
feebler
in
the
course
of
hours
he
remained
perhaps
less
affected
but
still
resolute
joking
in
the
evening
with
a
gentle
melancholy
about
his
condition
there
are
many
people
who
go
to
barèges
or
vichy
to
cure
their
bodies
and
why
should
not
i
go
and
cure
my
soul

durtal
it
is
time
to
think
about
packing
what
books
shall
i
take
to

me

live
down

he
searched
his
library
and
turned
over
the
mystical
books
which
had
by
degrees
replaced
profane
works
on
the
shelves
i
will
not
talk
of
saint
teresa
he
thought
neither
she
nor

would
be
indulgent
enough
to
me
in

have
need
of

pardon
and
consolation
saint
denys
the
areopagite
or
the
apocryphal
book
known
under
that
name
he
is
the
first
of
the
mystics
and
perhaps
has
gone
the
furthest
in
his
theological
definitions
he
lives
in
the
rarefied
air
of
the
mountain
tops
above
the
gulfs
on
the
threshold
of
the
other
world
which
he
sees
in
part
by
flashes
of
grace
and
he
remains
lucid
undazzled
in
the
blaze
of
light
around
him
it
seems
that
in
his
hierarchies
in
which
he
brings
out
in
procession
the
armies
of
heaven
and
shows
the
meaning
of
angelic
attributes
and
symbols
he
has
already
passed
the
limits
assigned
to
man
and
yet
in
his
names
he
ventures
even
a
step
further
and
then
he
raises
himself
into
the
of
metaphysics
at
once
calm
and
stern
he
the
human
word
to
give
it
greater
force
but
when
after
all
his
efforts
he
endeavours
to
define
the
indescribable
to
distinguish
those
never
to
be
confounded
persons
of
the
trinity
who
in
their
plurality
never
lose
their
unity
words
fail
on
his
lips
and
his
tongue
is
paralyzed
under
his
pen
then
tranquilly
and
without
any
astonishment
he
makes
himself
again
a
child
comes
down
from
those
heights
among
us
and
in
order
to
try
and
explain
to
us
what
he
understands
he
has
recourse
to
comparisons
with
domestic
life
and
that
he
may
explain
the
trinity
in
unity
he
notices
how
if
many
torches
be
lighted
in
one
hall
lights
though
distinct
mingle
in
one
and
are
in
fact
no
more
than

the
boldest
explorers

he
would
be
dry
reading
at
la
trappe
ruysbröck
he
thought
perhaps
and
yet
i
hardly
am
sure
i
might
put
him
in
my
bag
as
well
as
for
a
cordial
the
little
collection
distilled
by
hello
as
for
the
spiritual
marriages
so
well
translated
by
maeterlinck
they
are
disconnected
and
obscure
they
stifle
me
this
ruysbröck
oppresses
me
less
this
hermit
is
singular
all
the
same
for
he
does
not
enter
into
us
but
rather
goes
round
about
us
he
endeavours
like
saint
denys
to
arrive
at
god
rather
in
heaven
than
in
the
soul
but
in
wishing
to
take
such
a
flight
he
strains
his
wings
and
stammers
incomprehensibly
when
he
comes
down
we
will
leave
him
behind
then
now
let
us
see
saint
catherine
of
genoa
her
discussions
between
the
soul
the
body
and
are
unmeaning
and
confused
and
when
in
her
she
treats
of
the
operations
of
the
interior
life
she
is
greatly
below
saint
teresa
and
saint
angela
on
the
other
hand
her
treatise
on
purgatory
is
clear
it
declares
that
she
alone
has
penetrated
into
the
spaces
of
unknown
sorrows
and
that
she
has
disentangled
and
taken
hold
of
the
joys
she
has
in
fact
succeeded
in
reconciling
two
contraries
which
seemed
eternally
repugnant
the
suffering
of
the
soul
in
its
purification
from
sin
and
the
joy
of
the
same
soul
which
at
the
very
moment
it
is
enduring
frightful
torment
experiences
immense
happiness
for
little
by
little
it
draws
near
to
god
and
feels
his
rays
attract
it
more
and
more
and
his
love
inundate
it
with
such
excess
that
it
would
seem
the
saviour
desires
nought
but
only
it
saint
catherine
sets
forth
also
that
jesus
forbids
heaven
to
none
that
it
is
the
soul
herself
who
deeming
herself
unworthy
to
attain
it
flings
herself
by
her
own
motion
into
purgatory
there
to
cleanse
herself
for
she
has
only
one
end
to
herself
in
her
primitive
purity
only
one
desire
to
attain
her
last
end
by
destroying
herself
annihilating
herself
losing
herself
in
god
this
is
a
conclusive
study
murmured
durtal
but
not
that
which
would
lead
to
la
trappe
we
must
try
again
he
touched
other
volumes
in
the
here
for
instance
is
one
which
obviously
i
should
use
he
went
on
as
he
took
down
the
seraphic
theology
of
saint
bonaventure
for
he
condenses
the
means
of
of
meditation
for
communion
of
thoughts
on
death
then
in
these
is
a
treatise
on
the
contempt
of
the
world
whose
terse
phrases
are
admirable
it
is
the
true
essence
of
the
holy
spirit
a
jelly
of
unction
firm
set
we
will
put
that
on
one
side
i
shall
hardly
find
a
better
help
to
remedy
the
probable
weariness
of
solitude
murmured
durtal
turning
over
new
ranks
of
volumes
he
looked
at
the
titles
the
life
of
the
blessed
virgin
by
olier
he
hesitated
saying
to
himself
under
a
style
which
is
like
water
with
scarcely
the
chill
off
there
are
some
interesting
observations
some
tasteful
comments
olier
has
in
a
way
traversed
the
mysterious
territory
of
hidden
designs
and
has
there
discovered
the
unimaginable
truths
which
the
lord
is
sometimes
pleased
to
reveal
to
his
saints
he
has
made
himself
the
of
our
lady
and
living
near
her
has
made
himself
also
the
herald
of
her
attributes
the
legate
of
her
graces
his
life
of
mary
is
certainly
the
only
one
which
seems
really
inspired
and
is
possible
to
read
where
the
abbess
of
agreda
wanders
he
alone
remains
vigorous
and
clear
he
shows
us
the
virgin
existing
from
all
eternity
in
god
conceiving
without
ceasing
to
be
immaculate
like
the
crystal
which
receives
and
reflects
the
rays
of
the
sun
yet
loses
nothing
of
its
lustre
and
indeed
shines
with
greater
brightness
bringing
forth
without
pain
but
suffering
at
the
death
of
her
son
the
pangs
she
would
have
borne
at
his
birth
then
he
gives
us
learned
dissertations
on
her
whom
he
calls
the
of
all
good
the
mediatrix
of
love
and
impetration
yes
but
to
converse
with
her
nothing
is
so
good
as
the
parvum
beatæ
virginis
and
that
concluded
durtal
i
will
put
in
my
bag
with
my
we
will
not
disturb
olier
volume
my
stock
begins
to
give
out
he
continued
angela
of
foligno
certainly
she
is
a
brasier
at
which
one
may
warm
one
soul
i
will
take
her
with
me
what
more
tauler
sermons
i
am
tempted
to
do
so
for
never
has
any
treated
better
than
this
monk
the
most
abstruse
subjects
with
a
more
perfectly
lucid
mind
by
aid
of
familiar
images
humble
analogies
he
has
rendered
accessible
the
highest
speculations
of
mysticism
he
is
homely
and
deep
then
he
borrows
a
little
from
quietism
and
perhaps
it
will
be
no
bad
thing
to
absorb
down
there
a
few
drops
of
that
mixture
yet
on
the
whole
no
i
have
rather
need
of
nerve
tonics
as
to
suso
he
is
a
remedy
far
inferior
to
saint
bonaventure
or
saint
angela
i
put
aside
also
saint
bridget
of
sweden
for
in
her
conversations
with
heaven
she
seems
aided
by
a
god
morose
and
tired
who
reveals
to
her
nothing
unexpected
nothing
new
there
is
also
saint
magdalen
of
pazzi
that
voluble
carmelite
whose
work
is
a
series
of
apostrophes
an
exclamatory
person
clever
at
analogies
expert
in
coincidences
a
saint
infatuated
with
metaphors
and
hyperboles
she
talks
directly
with
god
the
father
and
stammers
out
in
ecstasy
explanations
of
the
mysteries
revealed
to
her
by
the
ancient
of
days
her
books
contain
one
sovereign
page
on
the
circumcision
another
magnificent
one
entirely
made
up
of
antitheses
on
the
holy
spirit
others
very
strange
on
the
deification
of
the
human
soul
on
its
union
with
heaven
and
on
the
part
assigned
in
this
operation
to
the
wounds
of
the
word
these
are
inhabited
nests
the
eagle
which
is
the
symbol
of
faith
resides
in
the
eyrie
of
the
left
foot
in
the
hole
of
the
right
foot
resides
the
melancholy
sweetness
of
the
in
the
wound
of
the
left
hand
the
dove
ensconces
herself
the
symbol
of
surrender
and
in
the
cavity
of
the
right
hand
reposes
the
pelican
the
emblem
of
love
these
birds
leave
their
nests
and
come
to
seek
the
soul
that
they
may
lead
it
to
the
nuptial
chamber
of
the
wound
which
bleeds
in
the
side
of
christ
was
it
not
also
that
carmelite
nun
who
ravished
by
the
power
of
grace
despised
so
greatly
the
certitude
acquired
by
the
way
of
the
senses
as
to
say
to
the
lord
i
saw
thee
with
mine
eyes
i
should
have
faith
no
more
because
faith
ceases
where
evidence
comes
in
all
things
considered
he
said
magdalen
of
pazzi
with
her
dialogues
and
contemplations
opens
eloquent
horizons
but
the
soul
snared
in
the
of
its
sins
can
not
follow
her
no
this
saint
can
not
reassure
me
in
the
cloister
ah
he
went
on
shaking
the
dust
from
a
volume
in
a
grey
cover
ah
it
is
true
i
have
the
precious
blood
of
father
faber
and
he
began
to
dream
as
he
turned
over
its
pages
where
he
stood
he
remembered
the
impression
till
now
forgotten
produced
on
him
when
he
read
it
the
work
of
this
oratorian
was
at
least
strange
the
pages
boiled
over
ran
forth
tumultuously
carrying
with
them
grandiose
visions
such
as
hugo
conceived
developing
historical
perspectives
such
as
michelet
loved
to
paint
in
this
volume
was
seen
advancing
the
solemn
procession
of
the
precious
blood
starting
from
the
confines
of
humanity
from
the
origin
of
the
ages
and
it
broke
the
bounds
of
the
worlds
overwhelmed
the
nations
submerged
history
father
faber
was
less
a
mystic
properly
than
a
visionary
and
a
poet
in
spite
of
the
abuse
of
rhetoric
transferred
from
the
pulpit
to
a
book
he
tore
up
souls
by
roots
carried
them
away
on
the
rush
of
the
stream
but
when
one
regained
footing
and
sought
to
remember
what
had
been
heard
and
seen
one
could
recall
nothing
on
reflection
one
recognized
that
the
theme
of
the
work
was
very
thin
too
slender
to
have
been
executed
by
so
noisy
an
orchestra
and
there
remained
of
that
reading
something
distracting
and
feverish
which
made
you
uneasy
and
made
you
think
that
this
kind
of
book
had
only
very
distant
relation
to
the
heavenly
fulness
of
the
great
mystics
no
not
that
thought
durtal
now
what
have
we
selected
i
keep
the
little
collection
of
ruysbröck
the
life
of
angela
of
foligno
and
saint
bonaventure
and
the
best
of
all
for
my
state
of
soul
he
said
striking
his
forehead
he
went
back
to
his
and
seized
a
little
book
which
lay
alone
in
a
corner
he
sat
down
and
turned
it
over
saying
here
is
the
tonic
the
stimulant
in
weakness
the
strychnine
for
failure
of
faith
the
goad
which
drives
you
in
tears
to
the
feet
of
christ
the
of
sister
emmerich
she
was
no
chemist
of
the
spiritual
being
like
saint
teresa
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
our
interior
life
in
her
book
she
forgot
herself
and
left
us
on
one
side
for
she
saw
only
jesus
crucified
and
wished
only
to
show
the
stages
of
his
agony
and
to
leave
marked
on
her
pages
as
on
the
veil
of
veronica
the
imprint
of
the
holy
face
though
she
was
of
our
time
for
catherine
emmerich
died
in
this
great
work
dates
from
the
middle
ages
it
is
a
picture
which
seems
to
belong
to
the
early
schools
of
franconia
and
swabia
this
woman
was
the
sister
of
the
zeitbloms
and
the
grünewalds
she
had
their
clear
visions
their
vivid
colouring
their
wild
scent
but
she
seemed
to
bring
back
also
by
her
care
for
exact
detail
by
her
precise
indication
of
places
the
old
flemish
masters
roger
van
der
weyden
and
bouts
she
united
in
herself
two
currents
springing
one
from
germany
the
other
from
flanders
and
this
painting
brushed
in
with
blood
and
varnished
with
tears
was
transposed
by
her
into
a
prose
style
which
has
no
relation
to
any
known
literature
of
which
we
can
only
find
by
analogy
the
ancestry
in
the
panels
of
the
fifteenth
century
moreover
she
was
quite
illiterate
had
never
read
a
book
nor
seen
a
painting
she
told
quite
plainly
what
she
saw
in
her
ecstasies
the
pictures
of
the
passion
unfolded
themselves
before
her
while
she
was
crushed
by
suffering
bleeding
from
the
wounds
of
her
stigmata
she
mourned
and
wept
brought
to
nothingness
by
love
and
pity
before
the
torments
of
christ
according
to
her
words
which
a
scribe
took
down
calvary
rose
and
the
whole
rascaldom
of
the
soldiers
rushed
at
the
saviour
and
spat
on
him
frightful
episodes
took
place
where
jesus
chained
to
a
pillar
twisting
like
a
worm
under
the
lashes
of
the
scourgers
then
falling
looking
with
his
failing
eyes
at
the
fallen
women
who
held
him
by
the
hand
and
turned
away
in
disgust
from
his
lacerated
body
from
his
face
covered
with
threads
of
blood
as
with
a
red
net
then
slowly
patiently
only
stopping
to
sob
and
cry
for
mercy
she
described
the
soldiers
tearing
away
the
stuff
which
had
stuck
to
the
wounds
the
virgin
weeping
her
face
livid
and
her
lips
blue
she
related
the
agony
of
his
bearing
his
cross
how
he
fell
on
his
knees
grew
weaker
and
more
worn
when
death
came
it
was
a
frightful
spectacle
told
in
its
every
particular
forming
a
sublime
and
frightful
whole
the
redeemer
was
extended
on
a
cross
laid
on
the
ground
one
of
the
executioners
placed
a
knee
against
his
side
while
another
spread
his
fingers
abroad
and
a
third
hammered
in
a
nail
as
broad
as
a
crown
and
so
long
that
the
point
came
out
behind
the
wood
and
when
the
right
hand
was
riveted
the
torturers
saw
that
the
left
would
not
reach
to
the
place
they
intended
to
pierce
therefore
they
attached
a
rope
to
the
arm
pulled
it
with
all
their
force
dislocated
the
shoulder
and
the
cries
of
the
saviour
were
heard
above
the
blows
of
the
hammer
his
breast
was
seen
heaving
while
his
body
was
anguished
and
furrowed
by
terrible
shuddering
the
same
scene
was
repeated
to
fix
his
feet
they
also
did
not
reach
the
place
which
the
executioners
had
marked
the
body
had
to
be
tied
and
the
arms
bound
so
as
not
to
tear
the
hands
from
the
wood
and
then
it
was
necessary
to
hang
on
the
legs
so
as
to
lengthen
them
as
far
as
the
bracket
on
which
they
were
to
rest
all
at
once
the
entire
body
yielded
the
ribs
moved
under
the
skin
the
shock
was
so
fearful
that
the
executioners
believed
that
the
bones
would
start
and
burst
the
flesh
wherefore
they
made
haste
to
rest
the
left
foot
on
the
right
but
their
difficulties
began
again
the
feet
turned
over
and
it
was
necessary
to
bore
them
with
an
auger
to
fasten
them
this
continued
till
jesus
died
when
sister
emmerich
fainted
from
terror
her
stigmata
bled
afresh
and
her
wounded
head
rained
blood
in
this
book
the
whole
pack
of
jewish
hounds
was
seen
in
full
cry
the
imprecations
and
shouts
of
the
crowd
were
heard
the
virgin
was
shown
trembling
with
fever
the
magdalen
beyond
herself
was
terrible
by
her
cries
and
towering
above
this
lamentable
group
christ
appeared
pale
and
swollen
his
legs
entangled
in
his
robe
when
he
mounted
to
golgotha
clenching
his
broken
nails
on
the
cross
as
it
slipped
from
his
grasp
this
extraordinary
visionary
catherine
emmerich
also
described
the
surroundings
of
these
scenes
the
landscapes
of
judæa
which
she
had
never
visited
but
have
since
been
recognized
as
exact
without
knowing
it
without
willing
it
this
illiterate
woman
became
an
unique
and
powerful
artist
wonderful
visionary
wonderful
painter
cried
durtal
and
also
wonderful
saint
he
added
running
over
the
life
of
this
nun
placed
as
a
preface
to
the
book
she
was
born
in
in
the
diocese
of
münster
the
child
of
poor
peasants
from
her
infancy
she
had
conversations
with
the
virgin
and
possessed
the
gift
which
also
was
given
to
saint
sibylline
of
pavia
ida
of
louvain
and
more
recently
to
louise
lateau
of
discerning
when
she
looked
at
or
touched
them
objects
which
had
been
blessed
from
those
which
had
not
she
entered
as
a
novice
the
augustinian
convent
at
dulmen
made
her
profession
when
she
was
her
health
failed
and
incessant
pain
tortured
her
which
she
increased
for
like
blessed
lidwine
she
obtained
from
heaven
permission
to
suffer
for
others
and
succour
the
sick
by
taking
their
maladies
in
under
the
government
of
jerome
bonaparte
king
of
westphalia
the
convent
was
suppressed
and
the
nuns
dispersed
infirm
and
penniless
she
was
carried
to
a
room
in
an
inn
where
she
had
to
bear
every
sort
of
curiosity
and
insult
christ
added
to
her
martyrdom
in
giving
her
the
stigmata
for
which
she
asked
she
could
neither
rise
nor
walk
nor
sit
could
take
no
food
but
the
juice
of
a
cherry
but
she
was
transported
by
long
ecstasies
in
these
she
visited
palestine
following
the
saviour
step
by
step
dictated
with
groans
this
fond
book
then
said
with
her
let
me
die
in
shame
with
jesus
on
the
cross
and
died
overwhelmed
with
joy
thanking
heaven
for
the
life
of
suffering
she
had
endured
ah
yes
i
will
take
the
passion
cried
durtal
to
himself
take
the
gospels
also
said
the
abbé
who
came
in
meanwhile
they
are
the
heavenly
phials
from
which
you
will
draw
the
oil
you
need
to
dress
your
wounds
it
will
be
equally
useful
and
truly
in
accordance
with
the
atmosphere
of
la
trappe
to
be
able
to
read
in
the
abbey
itself
the
works
of
saint
bernard
but
they
consist
of
unmanageable
folios
and
the
abridgments
and
extracts
in
volumes
of
a
more
convenient
form
are
so
that
i
have
never
had
the
courage
to
buy
them
they
have
saint
bernard
at
la
trappe
and
will
lend
you
the
volumes
if
you
ask
them
but
where
are
you
from
the
spiritual
point
of
view
how
are
you
getting
on
i
am
melancholy
badly
prepared
and
resigned
i
can
not
tell
if
weariness
has
come
from
my
turning
always
on
the
same
round
like
a
circus
horse
but
at
this
moment
i
am
not
suffering
i
am
persuaded
that
this
change
of
place
is
necessary
and
that
it
would
be
useless
to
hesitate
all
the
same
he
said
after
a
silence
it
is
very
odd
that
i
am
going
to
imprison
myself
in
a
monastery
and
in
truth
in
spite
of
myself
that
astonishes
me
i
will
admit
said
the
abbé
laughing
that
when
i
first
met
you
at
tocane
i
never
thought
i
was
pointed
out
to
direct
you
to
a
monastery
ah
you
see
i
must
evidently
belong
to
that
category
of
people
whom
i
may
call
mere
bridges
involuntary
brokers
of
souls
who
are
imposed
on
you
for
a
certain
end
which
you
do
not
suspect
and
of
which
even
themselves
are
ignorant
rather
if
any
one
were
a
mere
bridge
in
this
matter
answered
durtal
it
was
tocane
for
it
was
he
who
brought
us
together
and
we
kick
him
away
as
soon
as
he
has
finished
his
unconscious
task
it
was
evidently
designed
that
we
should
know
each
other
that
is
true
said
the
abbé
with
a
smile
now
i
do
not
suppose
i
shall
see
you
again
before
you
start
for
i
go
to
mâcon
where
i
shall
stay
five
days
time
to
see
my
nephews
and
to
sign
some
law
papers
at
any
rate
keep
up
your
courage
and
do
not
forget
to
send
me
news
of
yourself
write
to
me
without
much
delay
that
i
may
find
your
letter
when
i
return
to
paris
and
as
durtal
thanked
him
for
his
constant
kindness
he
took
his
hand
and
held
it
in
his
own
say
nothing
about
that
he
said
you
have
only
to
thank
him
whose
fatherly
impatience
has
broken
the
obstinate
slumber
of
your
faith
you
owe
thanks
to
god
only
thank
him
in
getting
rid
of
your
nature
as
soon
as
possible
and
leaving
the
house
of
your
conscience
empty
for
him
the
more
you
die
to
yourself
the
better
will
he
live
in
you
prayer
is
the
most
powerful
ascetic
means
by
which
you
can
renounce
yourself
empty
yourself
and
render
yourself
humble
in
this
matter
pray
therefore
without
ceasing
at
la
trappe
implore
our
lady
especially
for
like
myrrh
which
consumes
the
proud
flesh
of
wounds
she
heals
the
ulcers
of
the
soul
i
on
my
side
will
pray
for
you
as
best
i
can
you
can
thus
in
your
weakness
lean
so
as
not
to
fall
on
that
firm
and
protecting
pillar
of
prayer
of
which
saint
teresa
speaks
once
again
a
safe
journey
to
you
we
shall
meet
soon
again
my
son
durtal
remained
much
disturbed
it
is
most
tiresome
he
thought
that
this
priest
is
leaving
paris
before
me
for
indeed
if
i
have
need
of
spiritual
help
or
counsel
to
whom
shall
i
go
it
is
clearly
written
that
i
must
end
as
i
have
begun
alone
but
but
solitude
under
these
conditions
is
alarming
i
am
no
spoilt
child
whatever
the
abbé
may
say
next
morning
durtal
awoke
ill
furious
neuralgia
bored
his
temples
like
a
gimlet
he
tried
to
stop
it
with
antipyrine
but
this
medicine
in
a
large
dose
put
his
stomach
out
of
order
without
abating
the
strokes
of
the
machine
which
penetrated
his
skull
he
wandered
about
his
rooms
changing
from
one
seat
to
another
coiling
himself
up
in
an
getting
up
to
lie
down
again
jumping
from
his
bed
in
fits
of
sickness
upsetting
his
furniture
from
time
to
time
he
could
assign
no
precise
cause
for
this
attack
he
had
slept
his
fill
and
had
not
exceeded
in
any
way
the
night
before
he
thought
with
his
head
in
his
hands
there
are
still
two
days
counting
before
i
leave
paris
and
very
fit
i
am
for
it
i
shall
not
be
in
a
state
to
travel
by
train
and
if
i
travel
the
food
at
la
trappe
will
finish
me
he
had
a
minute
comfort
from
the
idea
that
through
no
fault
of
his
own
he
might
perhaps
avoid
his
painful
duty
and
remain
at
home
but
the
reaction
was
immediate
he
understood
that
if
he
did
not
go
he
was
lost
the
vacillation
of
his
soul
had
become
chronic
the
crisis
of
disgust
of
self
the
acute
regret
of
an
effort
consented
to
with
pain
and
suddenly
missed
the
certainty
that
it
would
only
be
postponed
for
a
time
that
he
would
have
to
pass
again
through
alternations
of
revolt
and
terror
and
begin
again
to
fight
with
himself
for
conviction
admitting
that
i
am
not
in
a
state
to
travel
i
have
always
the
resource
of
making
my
confession
to
the
abbé
when
he
returns
and
of
communicating
in
paris
he
thought
but
he
shook
his
head
saying
to
himself
once
more
that
he
felt
and
knew
that
was
not
his
duty
but
then
he
said
to
god
since
thou
dost
implant
this
idea
in
me
so
violently
that
i
can
not
even
discuss
it
in
spite
of
its
entire
common
sense
for
after
all
it
is
not
necessary
to
immure
myself
in
a
trappist
monastery
in
order
to
reconcile
myself
to
thee
then
let
me
go
and
he
spoke
to
god
quietly
my
soul
is
an
evil
place
sordid
and
infamous
till
now
it
has
loved
only
perverse
ways
it
has
exacted
from
my
wretched
body
the
tithe
of
illicit
pleasures
and
unholy
joys
it
is
worth
little
it
is
worth
nothing
and
yet
down
there
near
thee
if
thou
wilt
succour
me
i
think
that
i
shall
subdue
it
but
if
my
body
be
sick
i
can
not
force
it
to
obey
me
this
is
worse
than
all
i
am
disarmed
if
thou
do
not
come
to
my
aid
take
count
of
this
o
lord
i
know
by
experience
that
when
i
am
i
have
neuralgia
humanly
logically
speaking
i
am
certain
to
be
horribly
ill
at
notre
dame
de
nevertheless
if
i
can
get
about
at
all
the
day
after
i
will
go
all
the
same
in
default
of
love
this
is
the
sole
proof
i
can
give
that
i
truly
desire
thee
that
truly
i
hope
and
believe
in
thee
but
then
o
lord
aid
me
he
added
sadly
ah
indeed
i
am
no
lidwine
or
catherine
emmerich
who
when
thou
didst
strike
them
cried
out
more
more
thou
dost
scarce
touch
me
and
i
protest
but
what
wouldest
thou
thou
dost
know
better
than
i
physical
suffering
breaks
me
down
drives
me
to
despair
he
went
to
sleep
at
last
to
kill
the
day
in
bed
slumbering
to
wake
again
suddenly
from
frightful
nightmares
the
next
day
his
head
seemed
empty
and
his
heart
feeble
but
his
neuralgia
was
less
violent
he
rose
saying
to
himself
that
he
must
eat
though
he
was
not
hungry
for
fear
his
pain
should
return
he
went
out
and
wandered
in
the
luxembourg
saying
to
himself
that
he
must
arrange
his
time
that
after
breakfast
he
would
visit
severin
then
he
would
go
home
and
pack
and
afterwards
finish
the
day
at
notre
dame
des
victoires
the
walk
did
him
good
his
head
was
lighter
and
his
heart
free
he
went
into
a
restaurant
where
because
of
the
early
hour
nothing
was
ready
he
spent
the
time
before
a
newspaper
on
a
bench
how
often
he
had
held
papers
thus
without
reading
them
how
many
evenings
he
had
waited
in
cafés
with
his
nose
in
an
article
thinking
of
other
matters
at
those
times
especially
when
he
was
striving
with
his
vices
when
florence
appeared
to
him
still
keeping
the
clear
smile
of
a
little
girl
on
her
way
to
school
her
eyes
cast
down
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
her
apron
suddenly
the
child
changed
into
a
ghoul
who
whirled
round
him
wildly
and
made
him
silently
understand
the
horror
of
his
desires
all
that
was
now
far
distant
almost
in
one
day
the
charm
was
broken
without
any
real
strife
or
true
effort
without
inward
struggles
he
had
abstained
from
seeing
her
and
now
when
she
roused
his
memory
again
she
was
no
more
in
fact
than
a
recollection
odious
and
sweet
after
all
thought
durtal
as
he
cut
up
his
beefsteak
i
wonder
what
she
thinks
of
me
she
must
certainly
suppose
me
dead
or
lost
happily
i
have
never
met
her
and
she
does
not
know
my
address
well
he
went
on
there
is
no
use
in
stirring
the
mud
it
will
be
time
to
cleanse
it
when
i
am
at
la
trappe
and
he
shuddered
for
the
idea
of
the
confessor
again
took
root
in
him
and
he
was
obliged
to
tell
himself
for
the
twentieth
time
that
the
expected
never
happens
and
to
declare
that
he
should
find
some
good
fellow
of
a
monk
who
would
listen
to
him
then
he
was
afraid
again
putting
things
at
their
worst
and
fancying
himself
turned
out
like
a
mangy
dog
he
finished
his
breakfast
and
went
to
severin
there
the
crisis
declared
itself
the
overcharged
soul
gave
way
struck
down
by
a
congestion
of
sadness
he
lay
on
a
chair
in
such
a
state
of
depression
that
he
could
think
no
more
he
remained
inert
without
the
power
of
suffering
till
little
by
little
the
soul
recovered
from
its
torpor
came
to
itself
in
a
flood
of
tears
these
tears
gave
him
solace
he
wept
over
his
lot
thought
himself
so
unhappy
so
worthy
of
pity
that
he
hoped
still
more
for
help
yet
he
dare
not
address
himself
to
christ
whom
he
thought
less
accessible
but
he
spoke
in
low
tones
to
the
virgin
murmuring
that
prayer
in
which
saint
bernard
reminds
the
mother
of
christ
that
never
in
human
memory
was
it
heard
that
she
abandoned
any
of
those
who
sought
her
aid
he
left
severin
consoled
and
more
resolved
and
when
once
at
home
was
taken
up
with
preparations
for
departure
afraid
that
he
would
find
nothing
he
wanted
down
there
he
determined
to
stuff
his
portmanteau
full
he
crammed
into
the
corners
sugar
packets
of
chocolate
that
he
might
try
to
deceive
if
needful
the
anguish
of
a
fasting
stomach
took
towels
thinking
there
would
be
few
at
la
trappe
prepared
a
stock
of
tobacco
and
matches
then
besides
books
paper
pencils
ink
packets
of
antipyrine
a
phial
of
laudanum
which
he
wrapped
in
handkerchiefs
and
wedged
into
his
slippers
when
he
had
strapped
his
portmanteau
he
said
to
himself
looking
at
the
clock
at
this
time
i
shall
be
jolting
in
a
cab
and
my
seclusion
will
be
near
at
hand
never
mind
i
shall
do
well
in
anticipation
of
bodily
ailment
to
ask
for
the
confessor
as
soon
as
i
get
there
and
suppose
that
turns
out
badly
i
shall
have
time
to
make
arrangements
and
take
the
train
back
at
once
all
the
same
this
will
not
prevent
my
having
a
wretched
moment
this
evening
when
i
enter
notre
dame
des
victoires
but
his
anxieties
and
emotions
vanished
when
the
hour
of
benediction
came
he
was
seized
by
the
giddy
infection
of
the
church
and
he
wrapped
steeped
and
lost
himself
in
the
prayer
which
arose
from
all
those
souls
in
the
chant
which
went
up
from
every
mouth
and
when
the
monstrance
was
brought
forward
to
make
its
sign
in
the
air
he
felt
a
vast
peace
descend
upon
him
at
evening
as
he
undressed
he
sighed
i
shall
lie
down
in
a
cell
amazing
when
i
think
of
it
i
should
have
considered
anyone
mad
who
a
few
years
ago
had
prophesied
that
i
should
take
refuge
in
a
trappist
monastery
yet
now
i
am
going
there
of
my
own
accord
and
yet
no
i
am
going
driven
by
an
unknown
power
i
am
going
as
a
whipped
cur
after
all
what
a
symptom
of
the
time
it
is
society
must
indeed
be
unclean
if
god
has
no
longer
the
right
to
be
hard
and
is
reduced
to
pick
up
what
he
finds
and
to
content
himself
with
gathering
to
himself
people
like
me
second
part
chapter
durtal
awoke
gay
and
brisk
astonished
at
not
hearing
himself
groan
when
the
moment
had
come
in
which
he
should
set
off
for
la
trappe
he
was
wonderfully
reassured
he
tried
to
recollect
himself
and
to
pray
but
he
felt
his
thoughts
more
scattered
and
wandering
than
usual
he
remained
indifferent
and
unmoved
surprised
at
this
result
he
tried
to
examine
himself
and
touched
the
void
he
was
slack
that
morning
in
one
of
those
sudden
dispositions
in
which
a
man
becomes
a
child
again
incapable
of
attention
in
which
the
wrong
side
of
things
disappears
and
everything
distracts
he
dressed
hastily
got
into
a
cab
was
too
early
at
the
station
and
there
experienced
a
perfectly
childish
attack
of
vanity
looking
at
the
people
who
hurried
through
the
waiting
rooms
thronged
the
ticket
offices
or
resignedly
followed
their
luggage
he
was
not
far
from
admiring
himself
if
these
travellers
who
think
only
of
their
pleasures
or
their
business
knew
where
i
am
going
he
thought
then
he
reproached
himself
for
the
stupidity
of
these
reflections
and
as
soon
as
he
was
settled
in
his
compartment
in
which
he
chanced
to
be
alone
he
lighted
a
cigarette
saying
to
himself
let
us
profit
at
least
by
the
time
there
is
still
for
smoking
and
he
began
to
wander
to
dream
about
the
position
of
the
monastery
and
rove
about
the
neighbourhood
of
la
trappe
he
remembered
that
a
review
had
recently
estimated
the
number
of
nuns
and
monks
in
france
at
two
hundred
thousand
two
hundred
thousand
persons
who
in
such
an
epoch
have
understood
the
wickedness
of
the
struggle
for
life
the
filth
of
sexual
relations
the
horror
of
those
are
they
who
save
the
honour
of
the
country
he
thought
then
passing
at
a
bound
from
cloistered
souls
to
the
treatises
he
had
put
in
his
portmanteau
he
went
on
it
is
all
the
same
curious
how
completely
the
temperament
of
french
art
rebels
against
mysticism
all
exalted
writers
are
foreigners

ah
he
said
struck
by
the
last
name
he
had
cited
i
ought
to
have
brought
his
golden
legend
in
my
bag
how
was
it
i
did
not
remember
it
for
that
book
is
in
fact
the
very
crowning
work
of
the
middle
ages
the
stimulant
for
hours
rendered
languid
by
the
prolonged
uneasiness
of
fasting
the
simple
aid
of
pious
vigils
for
the
most
incredulous
souls
of
our
time
the
golden
legend
at
least
still
seems
like
one
of
those
pure
parchments
on
which
simple
illuminators
painted
the
faces
of
saints

gum

it
is
quite
absurd
to
have

book
for
it
would
have
made
me
pass
precious
days
like
those
of
old
in
la
trappe
yes
it
is
strange
he
thought
returning
on
his
thoughts
and
coming
back
to
his
first
idea
france
can
count
religious
authors
more
or
less
celebrated
but
very
few
mystical
writers
properly
and
it
is
just
the
same
also
in
painting
the
true
early
masters
are
flemish
german
or
italian
none
are

the
flemish
no
it
can
not
be
denied
the
genius
of
our
race
can
not
easily
follow
and
explain
how
god
acts
when
he
works
in
the
central
depths
of
the
soul
which
is
the
ovary
of
thought
the
very
source
of
conception
it
is
refractory
at
explaining
by
the
expressive
power
of
words
the
crash
or
the
silence
of
grace
bursting
forth
in
the
domain
which
is
wasted
by
sin
it
is
inapt
at
extracting
from
that
secret
world
works
of
psychology
like
those
of
saint
teresa
and
saint
john
of
the
cross
works
of
art
like
those
of
voragine
or
sister
emmerich
besides
that
our
field
is
scarcely
arable
and
our
soil
harsh
where
shall
we
now
find
the
labourer
who
sows
and
harrows
it
who
prepares
not
even
a
mystical
harvest
but
even
any
spiritual
fruit
capable
of
assuaging
the
hunger
of
the
few
who
stray
and
are
lost
and
fall
from
inanition
in
the
icy
desert
of
our
time
he
who
should
be
the
cultivator
of
that
land
the
farmer
of
souls
the
priest
has
not
strength
to
clear
the
ground
the
seminary
has
made
him
arbitrary
and
puerile
life
outside
has
made
him
lukewarm
therefore
it
seems
that
god
has
withdrawn
himself
from
him
and
the
proof
of
this
is
that
he
has
taken
away
all
ability
from
the
priesthood
there
are
no
priests
now
who
have
talent
either
in
the
pulpit
or
in
books
the
laity
have
inherited
that
grace
which
was
so
common
in
the
church
of
the
middle
ages
another
example
proves
it
still
more
priests
make
so
few
conversions
in
these
days
the
being
who
pleases
heaven
does
without
them
the
saviour
himself
strikes
him
down
handles
him
works
directly
on
him
the
ignorance
of
the
clergy
their
want
of
education
their
unintelligence
of
their
surroundings
their
dislike
for
mysticism
their
incomprehension
of
art
have
taken
away
all
their
influence
on
the
aristocracy
of
souls
their
only
action
is
now
on
the
childish
brains
of
bigots
and
pretenders
and
this
is
no
doubt
providential
it
is
better
so
for
if
the
priest
became
the
master
if
he
succeeded
in
raising
and
vivifying
the
wearisome
tribe
he
manages
it
would
be
like
a
waterspout
of
clerical
stupidity
beating
down
on
a
country
would
be
the
end
of
all
literature
and
all
art
in
france
to
save
the
church
there
remains
the
monk
whom
the
priest
detests
for
the
life
of
the
cloister
is
a
constant
reproach
to
his
own
existence
continued
durtal
always
supposing
that
my
illusions
are
not
again
destroyed
when
i
see
a
monastery
but
no
i
am
lucky
i
have
discovered
in
paris
one
of
those
few
abbés
who
is
neither
indifferent
nor
a
pedant
why
should
i
not
in
an
abbey
come
into
contact
with
authentic
monks
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
looked
at
the
landscape
from
the
carriage
window
the
train
was
passing
through
fields
in
front
of
which
the
telegraph
wires
danced
in
puffs
of
steam
the
landscape
was
flat
and
uninteresting
durtal
fell
back
sulkily
in
his
corner
the
arrival
at
the
convent
disturbs
me
he
murmured
since
there
are
no
useless
words
to
proffer
i
shall
confine
myself
to
giving
his
letter
to
the
father
guestmaster
ah
and
then
all
will
arrange
itself
he
felt
in
fact
a
perfect
calm
and
was
astonished
at
not
finding
in
himself
any
disgust
or
fear
at
being
almost
in
high
spirits
well
my
good
priest
was
right
in
declaring
that
i
was
creating
monsters
in
advance
and
he
thought
of
the
abbé
gévresin
was
surprised
that
long
as
he
had
visited
him
he
knew
nothing
whatever
of
his
antecedents
that
he
was
no
more
intimate
with
him
than
on
the
very
first
day
in
fact
it
only
rested
with
me
to
question
him
discreetly
but
the
idea
never
entered
my
head
it
is
true
that
our
intercourse
has
been
strictly
limited
to
matters
of
religion
and
art
this
perpetual
reserve
does
not
create
very
thrilling
friendships
but
it
institutes
a
sort
of
jansenism
of
the
affections
which
is
not
without
charm
in
any
case
that
ecclesiastic
is
a
holy
man
he
has
not
even
that
manner
at
once
caressing
and
reserved
of
other
priests
apart
from
certain
gestures
his
habit
of
rolling
his
arms
in
his
cincture
of
wrapping
his
hands
in
his
sleeves
of
liking
to
walk
backwards
when
in
conversation
apart
from
his
innocent
mania
of
interlarding
his
phrases
with
latin
he
does
not
recall
either
the
attitude
or
the
unfashionable
speech
of
his
brethren
he
loves
mysticism
and
plain
song
he
is
exceptional
and
therefore
he
must
have
been
also
carefully
chosen
for
me
in
heaven
ah
well
we
must
be
getting
near
he
sighed
looking
at
his
watch
i
am
beginning
to
feel
hungry
come
that
is
all
right
we
shall
be
at
saint
landry
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
strummed
on
the
windows
of
the
carriage
saw
the
fields
and
woods
fly
past
smoked
a
cigarette
or
two
took
his
bag
from
the
rack
at
last
arrived
at
the
station
and
got
out
close
to
the
tiny
station
he
recognized
the
inn
of
which
the
abbé
had
told
him
he
found
a
good
woman
in
the
kitchen
who
said
all
right
sir
sit
down
they
will
put
the
horse
to
while
you
breakfast
he
fed
himself
on
uneatable
things
they
brought
him
a
calf
head
forgotten
in
a
tub
some
cutlets
that
were
high
vegetables
blackened
with
gravy
from
the
stove
in
his
present
mood
he
was
amused
at
this
infamous
meal
fell
back
upon
a
thin
wine
which
rasped
his
throat
and
resignedly
drank
coffee
which
left
a
sediment
of
peat
at
the
bottom
of
the
cup
then
he
climbed
into
a
jolting
car
driven
by
a
young
man
and
the
horse
went
off
at
a
smart
pace
through
the
village
and
into
the
country
on
the
way
he
asked
the
driver
for
some
information
about
la
trappe
but
the
peasant
knew
nothing
i
often
go
there
he
said
but
never
enter
the
carriage
stays
at
the
gate
so
you
see
i
can
tell
you
nothing
they
went
for
an
hour
rapidly
through
the
lanes
and
the
peasant
saluted
a
roadmaker
with
his
whip
and
said
to
durtal
they
say
that
the
eminets
eat
their
bellies
and
as
durtal
asked
what
he
meant
they
are
idle
dogs
they
lie
all
the
summer
on
their
bellies
in
the
shade
and
he
said
no
more
durtal
thought
of
nothing
he
digested
and
smoked
dizzy
with
the
rumbling
of
the
carriage
at
the
end
of
another
hour
they
came
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
are
we
near
oh
not
yet
can
we
see
la
trappe
from
a
distance
oh
no
you
must
have
your
nose
just
over
it
to
see
it
it
is
quite
in
a
bottom
at
the
end
of
a
lane
like
that
said
the
peasant
pointing
to
a
grassy
lane
into
which
they
turned
there
is
a
fellow
coming
from
the
place
he
said
pointing
out
a
vagabond
who
was
crossing
the
copse
at
a
great
pace
and
he
explained
to
durtal
that
every
beggar
had
a
right
to
food
and
even
to
lodging
at
la
trappe
they
gave
them
the
ordinary
fare
of
the
community
in
a
room
close
to
the
brother
porter
lodge
but
did
not
let
them
into
the
convent
when
durtal
asked
him
the
opinion
which
the
villagers
round
about
had
of
the
monks
the
peasant
was
evidently
afraid
of
compromising
himself
for
he
answered
some
say
nothing
about
them
durtal
began
to
be
rather
weary
when
suddenly
as
they
turned
out
of
a
lane
he
saw
an
immense
building
below
him
there
is
la
trappe
said
the
peasant
gathering
his
reins
for
the
descent
from
the
height
where
he
was
durtal
looked
over
the
roofs
and
saw
a
large
garden
with
thickets
and
in
front
of
them
a
formidable
crucifix
then
the
vision
disappeared
the
carriage
again
went
through
the
wood
descending
by
roads
where
the
foliage
intercepted
the
view
they
came
at
last
by
long
circuits
to
an
open
place
at
the
end
of
which
rose
a
wall
with
a
large
gate
in
the
middle
the
carriage
stopped
you
have
only
to
ring
said
the
peasant
showing
durtal
an
iron
chain
along
the
wall
and
he
added
shall
i
come
for
you
again
no
then
you
remain
here
and
the
peasant
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
turned
about
and
drove
up
the
hill
durtal
remained
as
one
crushed
his
portmanteau
at
his
feet
before
the
door
his
heart
beat
violently
all
his
assurance
all
his
enthusiasm
had
vanished
and
he
stammered
what
will
happen
to
me
within
and
with
a
swift
feeling
of
dread
there
passed
before
him
the
terrible
life
of
the
trappists
the
body
exhausted
from
want
of
sleep
prostrate
for
hours
on
the
pavement
the
soul
trembling
squeezed
like
a
sponge
in
the
hand
drilled
examined
ransacked
even
to
its
smallest
folds
and
at
the
end
of
its
failure
of
an
existence
thrown
like
a
wreck
against
this
rude
rock
into
the
silence
of
a
prison
and
the
dreadful
stillness
of
the
tomb
my
god
my
god
have
pity
upon
me
said
he
as
he
wiped
his
brow
mechanically
he
looked
around
as
if
he
expected
some
help
the
roads
were
deserted
and
the
woods
were
empty
no
sound
was
heard
in
the
country
or
in
the
monastery
at
any
rate
i
must
make
up
my
mind
to
ring
and
his
limbs
sinking
under
him
he
pulled
the
chain
the
sound
of
the
bell
hard
rusty
grumbling
sounded
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
get
up
and
do
be
a
fool
he
said
to
himself
as
he
heard
the
clatter
of
a
pair
of
sabots
behind
the
door
this
opened
and
a
very
old
monk
clad
in
the
brown
cloth
of
the
capuchins
looked
at
him
inquiringly
i
come
to
make
a
retreat
and
i
wish
to
see
father
etienne
the
monk
bowed
took
up
the
portmanteau
and
made
a
sign
to
durtal
to
follow
him
he
went
with
bent
head
and
short
steps
across
an
orchard
they
reached
a
grating
passed
on
the
right
of
the
vast
building
a
sort
of
dilapidated
chateau
flanked
by
two
wings
advancing
on
a
court
the
brother
entered
the
wing
close
to
the
grating
durtal
followed
him
along
a
corridor
into
which
several
grey
doors
opened
on
one
of
these
he
read
the
word
auditorium
the
trappist
stopped
before
it
lifted
the
wooden
latch
ushered
durtal
into
the
room
and
after
some
minutes
he
heard
repeated
calls
on
the
bell
durtal
sat
down
and
looked
at
this
gloomy
chamber
for
the
window
was
half
closed
by
shutters
there
was
little
furniture
the
most
important
a
with
an
old
cover
in
the
corner
a
above
which
was
nailed
a
figure
of
saint
antony
of
padua
rocking
the
infant
jesus
in
his
arms
a
large
crucifix
on
the
other
wall
and
here
and
there
were
placed
two
chairs
and
four
ordinary
chairs
durtal
took
from
his
the
letter
of
introduction
to
the
father
what
sort
of
reception
will
he
give
me
he
asked
himself
he
at
any
rate
can
speak
well
we
shall
soon
see
he
said
as
he
heard
steps
a
monk
in
white
with
a
black
scapular
whose
two
ends
fell
one
on
his
shoulders
the
other
on
his
breast
appeared
he
was
young
and
smiling
he
read
the
letter
then
he
took
durtal
hand
and
led
him
in
silent
astonishment
across
the
court
to
the
other
wing
of
the
building
opened
a
door
dipped
his
finger
in
a
stoup
and
offered
it
to
him
they
were
in
a
chapel
the
monk
invited
durtal
by
a
sign
to
kneel
on
a
step
before
the
altar
and
he
prayed
in
a
low
voice
he
then
rose
returned
slowly
to
the
threshold
offered
durtal
holy
water
again
still
without
opening
his
lips
and
leading
him
by
the
hand
they
went
the
way
they
came
to
the
auditorium
there
he
inquired
after
the
health
of
the
abbé
gévresin
seized
the
portmanteau
and
mounted
an
immense
staircase
falling
into
ruin
at
the
top
of
this
staircase
which
had
only
one
story
there
extended
a
vast
landing
bounded
at
each
of
its
extremities
by
a
door
father
etienne
entered
that
on
the
right
crossed
a
broad
vestibule
and
led
durtal
into
a
room
which
a
ticket
printed
in
large
letters
placed
under
the
invocation
of
benedict
and
said
i
am
sorry
sir
to
be
only
able
to
put
at
your
disposal
this
room
which
is
not
very
comfortable
but
it
will
do
very
well
said
durtal
and
the
view
is
charming
he
continued
approaching
the
window
at
least
you
will
be
in
good
air
said
the
monk
opening
the
casement
below
stretched
the
orchard
through
which
durtal
had
passed
under
the
conduct
of
the
brother
porter
an
enclosure
full
of
apple
trees
stunted
and
clipped
silvered
by
lichens
and
gilt
by
moss
then
beyond
the
monastery
and
above
the
walls
rose
fields
of
clover
intersected
by
a
great
white
road
extending
to
the
horizon
which
was
notched
by
the
foliage
of
trees
you
will
see
sir
father
etienne
went
on
if
you
need
anything
in
this
cell
and
tell
me
quite
simply
will
you
not
for
otherwise
we
should
heap
up
regret
for
both
of
us
for
you
who
have
only
to
ask
for
what
might
be
useful
to
you
for
me
who
should
only
discover
it
later
and
be
sorry
for
my
forgetfulness
durtal
looked
at
him
reassured
by
this
frank
greeting
he
was
a
young
priest
about
thirty
years
old
his
face
bright
and
finely
cut
was
streaked
with
red
fibres
on
the
cheeks
this
monk
wore
a
beard
and
round
his
shaven
head
was
a
crown
of
brown
hair
he
spoke
somewhat
rapidly
and
smiled
with
his
hands
pushed
into
the
large
leathern
belt
round
his
waist
i
will
come
back
directly
for
i
have
some
important
work
to
finish
he
said
try
to
make
yourself
at
home
as
much
as
possible
and
if
you
have
time
glance
over
the
rule
which
you
have
to
follow
in
this
monastery
it
is
written
on
one
of
these
cards
on
the
table
we
will
talk
about
it
after
you
have
mastered
it
if
you
like
and
he
left
durtal
alone
he
soon
made
an
inventory
of
the
room
it
was
very
high
and
extremely
narrow
like
a
the
door
was
at
one
end
the
window
at
the
other
at
the
bottom
in
a
corner
near
the
casement
was
a
little
iron
bed
and
a
small
round
table
in
chestnut
wood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
which
stood
along
the
wall
was
a
in
faded
rep
upon
which
was
a
crucifix
and
a
branch
of
dried
fir
below
it
on
the
same
side
was
a
table
of
white
wood
covered
with
a
towel
on
which
were
placed
an
ewer
a
basin
and
a
glass
on
the
opposite
wall
was
a
wardrobe
and
by
the
fireplace
on
the
mantelpiece
of
which
a
crucifix
was
placed
was
a
table
opposite
the
bed
near
the
window
three
straw
chairs
completed
the
furniture
of
this
room
i
shall
never
have
water
enough
to
wash
in
thought
durtal
gauging
the
miniature
jug
which
held
about
a
pint
since
father
etienne
shows
himself
so
obliging
i
must
ask
him
for
a
larger
ration
he
unpacked
his
portmanteau
undressed
put
on
flannel
instead
of
his
starched
shirt
arranged
his
toilet
things
on
the
folded
his
linen
in
the
wardrobe
then
sat
down
looked
around
the
cell
and
thought
it
sufficiently
comfortable
and
above
all
very
clean
he
then
went
towards
the
table
on
which
were
laid
a
ream
of
ruled
paper
an
inkstand
and
some
pens
he
was
grateful
for
this
attention
of
the
monk
who
knew
no
doubt
by
the
abbé
gévresin
letter
that
his
business
was
writing
opened
two
volumes
bound
in
leather
and
shut
them
again
the
one
was
the
introduction

francis
de

the

was
manresa
or
the
spiritual
exercises
of
saint
ignatius
of
loyola
and
he
arranged
his
own
books
on
the
table
then
he
took
up
just
as
it
came
one
of
the
cards
spread
on
the
table
and
read
exercises
of
the
community
for
ordinary
days

he
turned
the
card
and
on
the
other
side
was
a
new
horary
entitled
winter
exercises
from
the
invention
of
the
cross
in
september
to
easter
the
hour
of
rising
was
the
same
but
was
an
hour
earlier
dinner
was
changed
from
to
siesta
and
supper
at
were
suppressed
the
canonical
hours
were
the
same
except
vespers
and
compline
which
were
changed
from
and
to
and
it
is
not
pleasant
to
drag
oneself
from
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
sighed
durtal
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
retreatants
are
not
subject
to
this
rule
of
wakefulness
and
he
took
up
another
card
this
must
be
the
one
intended
for
me
he
said
reading
the
head
of
the
card
rules
of
retreat
from
easter
to
the
invention
of
the
cross
in
september
let
us
look
at
these
rules
rather
more
closely
he
examined
the
two
tables
brought
together
one
for
the
morning
and
one
for
the
evening
morning
rise
at
the
angelus

and

absolute

assist
at

salve

private

retire
to
rest
this
at
any
rate
is
more
practical
four
in
the
morning
is
an
almost
possible
hour
but
i
do
not
understand
it
the
canonical
hours
on
this
tablet
do
not
agree
with
those
of
the
monks
and
then
why
these
double
vespers
and
compline
lastly
these
little
points
in
which
you
are
invited
to
meditate
so
many
minutes
to
read
so
many
more
scarcely
suit
me
my
mind
is
scarcely
malleable
enough
to
run
in
those
channels
it
is
true
that
after
all
i
am
free
to
do
as
i
please
for
no
one
can
verify
what
tricks
i
may
play
can
know
for
instance
if
i
meditate
ah
here
is
again
a
regulation
at
the
back
he
went
on
as
he
turned
the
card
the
regulation
for
september
i
need
not
trouble
myself
about
it
it
differs
moreover
little
from
the
other
but
here
is
a
postscript
which
concerns
both
horaries
note
those
who
are
not
bound
to
say
the
breviary
will
say
the
little
office
of
the
blessed
virgin
the
retreatants
are
requested
to
make
their
confessions
at
an
early
date
in
order
to
have
their
mind
more
free
for
meditation
after
each
meditation
an
analogous
chapter
of
the
imitation
must
be
read
the
best
time
for
confessions
and
the
way
of
the
cross
is
from
in
the
morning
in
the
afternoon
and
in
summer
from
in
the
morning
till
in
the
afternoon
to
read
the
table
of
notices
it
is
well
to
be
punctual
at
meals
to
keep
no
one
waiting
the
father
guestmaster
alone
is
charged
with
providing
for
the
wants
of
guests
guests
may
ask
for
books
for
the
retreat
if
they
have
none
themselves
confession
he
saw
this
word
only
in
the
whole
series
of
rules
he
must
at
once
have
recourse
to
it
he
felt
a
cold
shiver
down
his
back
and
knew
that
he
must
speak
to
father
etienne
about
it
as
soon
as
he
returned
he
had
not
long
to
wrestle
with
himself
for
the
monk
entered
almost
at
once
and
said
have
you
noticed
anything
you
need
and
the
presence
of
which
may
be
useful
to
you
no
father
yet
if
you
could
let
me
have
a
little
more
water
nothing
is
easier
i
will
send
you
up
a
large
pitcher
every
morning
thank
you
see
i
have
been
studying
the
rules
i
will
at
once
put
you
at
ease
said
the
monk
you
are
compelled
to
nothing
but
the
strictest
punctuality
you
must
follow
the
canonical
offices
to
the
letter
as
to
the
exercises
marked
on
the
card
they
are
not
of
obligation
they
may
be
useful
as
they
are
laid
down
for
people
who
are
very
young
and
devoid
of
all
initiative
but
as
i
think
at
least
they
somewhat
hamper
others
and
as
a
general
rule
we
do
not
trouble
the
retreatants
here
we
let
solitude
act
on
them
it
belongs
to
yourself
to
discriminate
and
distinguish
the
best
mode
of
occupying
your
time
holily
therefore
i
will
not
impose
on
you
any
of
the
reading
laid
down
on
this
card
and
only
take
leave
to
get
you
to
say
the
little
office
of
the
blessed
virgin
have
you
it
here
it
is
said
durtal
holding
out
a
bound
book
your
volume
is
charming
said
father
etienne
as
he
turned
over
the
pages
exquisitely
printed
in
red
and
black
he
paused
at
one
of
them
and
read
aloud
the
third
lesson
of
matins
is
it
not
fine
he
cried
a
sudden
joy
sprang
up
in
his
face
his
eyes
grew
bright
his
hands
trembled
on
the
cover
yes
he
said
closing
it
read
this
office
here
especially
for
you
know
our
true
patroness
the
true
abbot
of
the
trappists
is
the
blessed
virgin
after
a
silence
he
continued
i
have
fixed
a
week
as
the
duration
of
your
retreat
in
the
letter
i
sent
to
the
abbé
gévresin
but
i
need
not
say
that
if
you
are
not
too
weary
here
you
can
stay
as
long
as
seems
good
to
you
i
hope
to
be
able
to
prolong
my
stay
among
you
but
this
must
depend
upon
the
way
in
which
my
body
stands
the
struggle
my
stomach
is
somewhat
weak
and
i
am
not
without
some
fear
i
shall
therefore
be
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
let
me
see
the
confessor
as
soon
as
possible
good
you
shall
see
him
i
will
tell
you
the
time
this
evening
after
compline
as
for
the
food
if
you
think
it
insufficient
i
will
see
that
you
have
an
extra
egg
but
there
ceases
the
discretion
i
can
exercise
for
the
rule
is
precise
no
fish
no
flesh
vegetables
and
i
am
bound
to
admit
they
are
not
first
rate
but
you
shall
judge
and
indeed
as
it
is
just
upon
i
will
show
you
the
room
where
you
will
dine
in
company
with
m
bruno
and
as
they
descended
the
staircase
the
monk
went
on
bruno
is
a
person
who
has
renounced
the
world
and
without
having
taken
the
vows
lives
enclosed
he
is
what
our
rule
calls
an
oblate
he
is
a
holy
and
learned
man
whom
you
will
certainly
like
you
can
talk
with
him
during
the
meal
ah
said
durtal
and
before
and
after
i
must
keep
silence
yes
unless
you
have
anything
to
ask
in
which
case
i
shall
be
always
at
your
service
ready
to
answer
you
as
for
that
question
of
silence
as
for
those
of
the
hours
of
rising
and
going
to
bed
and
the
offices
the
rule
allows
no
modification
it
must
be
observed
to
the
letter
good
said
durtal
a
little
taken
aback
by
the
decided
tone
of
the
father
but
i
saw
on
my
card
a
note
directing
me
to
consult
a
table
of
regulations
and
i
have
not
that
table
it
hangs
on
the
wall
of
the
staircase
near
your
room
you
can
read
it
when
your
head
is
rested
will
you
go
in
he
said
opening
a
door
in
the
lower
corridor
just
opposite
that
of
the
auditorium
durtal
bowed
to
an
old
gentleman
who
came
to
meet
him
the
monk
introduced
them
and
vanished
the
dishes
were
on
the
table
two
poached
eggs
a
bowl
of
rice
another
of
french
beans
and
a
pot
of
honey
bruno
said
grace
and
proceeded
to
help
durtal
he
gave
him
an
egg
this
is
a
poor
supper
for
a
parisian
he
said
with
a
smile
ah
as
long
as
there
is
an
egg
and
wine
it
is
bearable
i
was
afraid
i
confess
that
my
only
drink
would
be
cold
water
they
talked
as
friends
the
man
was
pleasant
and
distinguished
with
ascetic
features
but
with
a
bright
smile
lighting
up
a
grave
face
yellow
and
wrinkled
he
lent
himself
with
perfect
good
grace
to
durtal
inquiries
and
told
him
that
after
a
tempestuous
life
he
felt
that
grace
had
touched
him
and
he
had
retired
from
the
world
to
expiate
by
years
of
austerities
and
silence
his
own
sins
and
those
of
others
and
you
have
never
grown
tired
of
being
here
never
during
the
five
years
that
i
have
spent
in
this
cloister
time
cut
up
as
it
is
at
la
trappe
seems
short
you
are
present
at
all
the
exercises
of
the
community
yes
i
only
replace
manual
labour
by
meditation
in
my
cell
my
position
as
oblate
however
dispenses
me
if
i
so
wish
from
getting
up
at
two
to
follow
the
night
office
but
it
is
a
great
joy
to
me
to
recite
the
magnificent
benedictine
psalter
before
daybreak
but
you
are
listening
to
me
and
eat
nothing
let
me
give
you
a
little
more
rice
no
thank
you
but
i
will
take
if
you
will
allow
me
a
spoonful
of
honey
the
food
is
not
bad
he
said
but
i
do
not
quite
understand
the
same
strange
and
identical
taste
in
all
the
dishes
it
smells
how
shall
i
express
it
like
burnt
fat
or
suet
that
is
the
warm
oil
with
which
the
vegetables
are
dressed
you
will
soon
grow
accustomed
to
it
in
a
couple
of
days
you
will
cease
to
notice
it
but
in
what
consists
precisely
the
part
of
an
oblate
his
life
is
less
austere
and
more
contemplative
than
that
of
a
monk
he
may
travel
if
he
will
and
though
he
is
not
bound
by
vows
he
shares
in
all
the
spiritual
advantages
of
the
order
in
old
times
the
rule
admitted
those
whom
it
styled
those
were
oblates
who
received
the
tonsure
wore
a
distinct
costume
and
pronounced
the
three
greater
vows
they
led
in
fact
a
mitigated
life
half
layman
half
monk
this
rule
which
still
exists
among
the
true
benedictines
has
disappeared
among
the
trappists
since
the
year
the
date
at
which
it
was
suppressed
by
the
chapter
general
at
the
present
time
in
the
cistercian
abbeys
are
only
the
fathers
the
lay
brothers
the
oblates
when
there
are
any
and
the
peasants
employed
in
field
labour
the
lay
brothers
i
suppose
are
those
whose
heads
are
completely
shaven
and
who
are
clothed
in
a
brown
habit
like
the
monk
who
opened
the
door
to
me
yes
they
do
not
sing
office
and
have
only
manual
tasks
by
the
way
the
rule
for
retreat
which
i
read
in
my
room
does
not
seem
clear
as
far
as
i
recall
it
it
doubles
certain
offices
places
matins
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
vespers
at
two
in
any
case
the
horary
is
not
the
same
as
that
of
the
trappists
how
am
i
to
understand
and
reconcile
them
you
have
only
to
take
into
consideration
the
exercises
set
out
on
your
card
father
etienne
must
i
think
have
said
so
that
mould
was
only
made
for
people
who
can
not
occupy
and
guide
themselves
that
explains
to
you
how
to
prevent
them
from
becoming
idle
the
priests
breviary
has
been
in
some
degree
taken
to
pieces
and
their
time
has
been
distributed
in
small
slices
so
that
for
instance
they
may
be
obliged
to
recite
the
psalms
for
matins
at
hours
when
there
is
no
psalm
dinner
was
over
bruno
said
grace
and
said
to
durtal
you
have
twenty
minutes
free
from
now
to
compline
you
can
make
acquaintance
with
the
garden
and
woods
he
bowed
politely
and
went
out
i
can
smoke
a
cigarette
thought
durtal
when
he
was
alone
he
took
his
hat
and
left
the
room
night
was
coming
on
he
passed
through
the
great
court
skirted
a
small
building
surmounted
by
a
long
discovered
by
the
smell
that
it
was
a
chocolate
factory
and
entered
an
avenue
of
trees
the
sky
was
so
obscure
that
he
could
scarcely
see
the
group
of
trees
he
entered
and
not
seeing
anyone
he
rolled
his
cigarettes
and
smoked
them
slowly
with
enjoyment
consulting
his
watch
from
time
to
time
by
his
cigar
lights
he
was
astonished
at
the
silence
of
the
monastery
not
a
sound
however
hushed
however
distant
save
now
and
then
a
gentle
rustle
of
boughs
he
went
to
the
side
whence
the
noise
came
and
saw
a
piece
of
water
on
which
a
swan
was
sailing
which
came
towards
him
he
saw
its
white
plumage
oscillate
against
the
darkness
which
it
displaced
with
a
splash
when
a
bell
sounded
with
slow
strokes
ah
said
he
looking
again
at
his
watch
that
is
the
hour
of
compline
he
went
to
the
chapel
which
was
still
empty
and
he
took
occasion
of
the
solitude
to
examine
it
at
his
ease
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
truncated
cross
a
cross
without
a
foot
rounded
at
the
summit
holding
out
two
square
arms
with
a
door
at
either
end
the
upper
part
of
the
cross
below
a
cupola
painted
blue
formed
a
little
circular
apse
round
which
was
a
circle
of
stalls
placed
back
against
the
wall
in
the
middle
rose
a
great
altar
of
white
marble
surmounted
by
wooden
chandeliers
flanked
on
the
left
and
right
by
candelabra
also
of
wood
placed
on
marble
shafts
the
lower
part
of
the
altar
was
hollow
and
closed
in
front
by
a
glass
behind
which
appeared
a
shrine
in
gothic
style
which
reflected
in
its
copper
gilt
mirror
the
light
of
the
lamps
the
apse
opened
into
a
large
porch
with
three
steps
in
front
on
the
arms
of
the
cross
which
were
prolonged
into
a
kind
of
vestibule
serving
at
once
as
nave
and
side
aisles
to
this
stumpy
church
the
hollowed
arms
at
their
extremities
near
the
doors
held
two
very
small
chapels
set
back
in
niches
painted
blue
like
the
cupola
containing
above
two
stone
altars
without
ornament
two
mediocre
statues
one
of
saint
joseph
the
other
of
christ
lastly
a
fourth
altar
dedicated
to
the
virgin
was
situated
in
this
vestibule
opposite
the
steps
leading
to
the
apse
opposite
therefore
to
the
high
altar
it
was
relieved
against
a
window
whose
lights
represented
saint
bernard
in
white
on
one
hand
and
saint
benedict
in
black
on
the
other
and
it
appeared
to
recede
into
the
church
because
of
the
two
ranges
of
seats
which
stood
on
the
left
and
right
before
the
two
other
little
chapels
leaving
only
room
necessary
to
pass
along
the
vestibule
or
to
go
in
a
straight
line
from
this
altar
of
the
virgin
in
the
apse
to
the
high
altar
this
sanctuary
is
alarmingly
ugly
said
durtal
who
had
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
front
of
the
statue
of
saint
joseph
to
judge
by
the
few
subjects
carved
along
the
walls
this
edifice
dates
from
the
time
of
louis
an
abominable
date
for
a
church
he
was
disturbed
in
these
thoughts
by
the
sound
of
bells
and
at
the
same
time
all
the
doors
were
opened
one
situated
in
the
apse
itself
on
the
left
of
the
altar
gave
passage
to
about
half
a
score
monks
wrapped
in
great
white
cowls
who
spread
out
into
the
choir
and
occupied
the
stalls
on
either
side
then
by
the
two
doors
of
the
vestibule
came
a
crowd
of
brown
monks
who
knelt
at
the
benches
on
the
two
sides
of
our
lady
altar
durtal
had
some
of
them
near
him
but
they
bowed
their
heads
and
joined
their
hands
he
dared
not
observe
them
moreover
the
vestibule
had
become
almost
dark
the
light
was
concentrated
in
the
choir
where
the
lamps
were
kindled
he
could
make
out
the
faces
of
the
white
monks
in
their
stalls
in
the
part
of
the
apse
he
could
see
and
among
them
he
recognized
father
etienne
on
his
knees
near
a
short
monk
but
another
at
the
end
of
the
stalls
near
the
porch
almost
opposite
the
altar
and
in
full
light
attracted
him
he
was
tall
and
strong
and
looked
like
an
arab
in
his
white
burnous
durtal
could
only
see
him
in
profile
and
he
distinguished
a
long
grey
beard
a
shaven
skull
surrounded
by
the
monastic
crown
a
high
forehead
and
a
nose
like
an
eagle
beak
he
had
a
grand
appearance
with
his
imperious
features
and
his
fine
figure
as
it
swayed
under
the
cowl
that
is
probably
the
abbot
of
la
trappe
thought
durtal
and
he
felt
certain
when
this
monk
struck
a
little
bell
hidden
under
the
desk
before
him
and
directed
the
office
all
the
monks
bowed
to
the
altar
the
abbot
recited
the
opening
prayers
then
there
was
a
pause
and
from
the
other
side
of
the
apse
which
durtal
could
not
see
rose
the
frail
voice
of
an
old
man
a
voice
which
had
returned
to
the
clear
tones
of
childhood
but
was
just
a
little
cracked
growing
higher
as
it
declaimed
the
antiphon
deus
in
adjutorium
meum
intende
and
the
other
side
of
the
choir
that
on
which
were
father
etienne
and
the
abbot
answered
scanning
the
syllables
very
slowly
with
voices
of
bass
pitch
domine
ad
adjuvandum
me
festina
and
all
bowed
their
heads
over
the
folios
placed
before
them
and
took
up
the
words
gloria
patri
et
filio
et
spiritui
sancto
and
they
lifted
their
heads
while
the
other
part
of
the
fathers
pronounced
the
response
sicut
erat
in
principio
etc
the
office
began
it
was
not
chanted
but
declaimed
now
rapid
and
now
slow
the
side
of
the
choir
which
durtal
saw
made
all
the
vowels
sharp
and
short
letters
the
other
on
the
contrary
altered
them
all
into
long
letters
and
seemed
to
cap
all
the
os
with
a
circumflex
accent
it
might
be
said
that
one
side
had
the
pronunciation
of
the
south
the
other
that
of
the
north
thus
chanted
the
office
became
strange
and
ended
by
rocking
like
an
incantation
and
soothing
the
soul
which
fell
asleep
in
the
rolling
of
the
verses
interrupted
by
the
recurrent
doxology
like
a
refrain
after
the
last
verse
of
each
of
the
psalms
ah
well
i
can
not
understand
it
thought
durtal
who
had
his
compline
at
his
fingers
ends
they
are
not
singing
the
roman
office
at
all
the
fact
is
that
one
of
the
psalms
was
wanting
he
caught
indeed
at
one
moment
the
hymn
of
saint
ambrose
the
te
lucis
ante
terminum
sung
to
a
simple
and
rugged
tune
of
the
old
plain
chant
and
yet
the
last
stanza
was
not
the
same
but
he
lost
himself
afresh
and
waited
for
the
short
lessons
and
the
nunc
dimittis
which
never
came
yet
compline
does
not
vary
like
vespers
he
thought
i
must
ask
father
etienne
the
meaning
of
this
then
his
reflections
were
disturbed
by
a
young
white
monk
who
passed
him
genuflected
to
the
altar
and
lighted
two
tapers
suddenly
all
rose
and
with
a
great
shout
the
salve
regina
shook
the
arches
durtal
was
affected
as
he
listened
to
this
admirable
chant
which
had
nothing
in
common
with
that
which
is
bellowed
at
paris
in
the
churches
this
was
at
once
flexible
and
ardent
sustained
by
such
suppliant
adoration
that
it
seemed
to
concentrate
in
itself
alone
the
immemorial
hope
of
humanity
and
its
eternal
lamentation
chanted
without
accompaniment
unsustained
by
the
organ
by
voices
indifferent
to
themselves
and
blending
in
one
only
masculine
and
deep
it
rose
with
quiet
boldness
sprang
up
with
irresistible
flight
towards
our
lady
then
made
as
it
were
a
return
upon
itself
and
its
confidence
was
lessened
it
advanced
more
tremblingly
but
so
different
so
humble
that
it
felt
itself
forgiven
and
dared
then
in
passionate
appeals
to
demand
the
undeserved
pleasures
of
heaven
it
was
the
absolute
triumph
of
the
neumes
those
repetitions
of
notes
on
the
same
syllable
the
same
word
which
the
church
invented
to
paint
the
excess
of
that
interior
joy
or
sorrow
which
words
can
not
render
it
was
a
rush
a
going
forth
of
the
soul
escaping
in
the
passionate
voices
breathed
forth
by
the
bodies
of
the
monks
as
they
stood
and
trembled
durtal
followed
in
his
this
work
with
so
short
a
text
so
long
a
chant
and
as
he
listened
to
and
read
it
with
recollection
this
magnificent
prayer
seemed
to
decompose
as
a
whole
and
to
represent
three
different
states
of
the
soul
to
exhibit
the
triple
phase
of
humanity
during
its
youth
its
maturity
and
its
decline
it
was
in
a
word
an
essential
summary
of
prayer
for
all
ages
first
there
was
the
canticle
of
exultation
the
joyous
welcome
of
a
being
yet
little
stammering
forth
respectful
caresses
petting
with
gentle
words
and
fondness
of
a
child
who
seeks
to
coax
his
mother
this
is
the
salve
regina
mater
misericordiæ
vita
dulcedo
et
spes
nostra
salve
then
the
soul
so
candid
so
simply
happy
has
grown
and
knowing
the
wilful
failings
of
thought
the
repeated
loss
through
sin
joins
her
hands
and
asks
sobbing
for
help
she
adores
no
longer
with
a
smile
but
with
tears
it
is
ad
te
clamamus
exsules
filii
hevae
ad
te
suspiramus
gementes
et
flentes
in
hac
lachrymarum
valle
at
last
old
age
comes
the
soul
lies
tormented
by
the
memory
of
counsels
neglected
by
regret
for
lost
graces
and
having
become
weaker
and
more
full
of
fears
is
alarmed
before
her
deliverance
before
the
destruction
of
that
prison
of
the
flesh
which
she
feels
at
hand
and
then
she
thinks
of
the
eternal
death
of
those
whom
the
judge
condemns
on
her
knees
she
implores
the
advocatress
of
earth
the
consultrix
of
heaven
it
is
the
eia
ergo
advocata
nostra
illos
tuos
misericordes
oculos
ad
nos
converte
et
jesum
benedictum
fructum
ventris
tui
nobis
post
hoc
exilium
ostende
and
to
that
essence
of
prayer
composed
by
peter
of
compostella
or
hermann
contract
saint
bernard
in
an
excess
of
hyperdulia
added
the
three
invocations
at
the
end
o
clemens
o
pia
o
dulcis
virgo
maria
sealing
the
inimitable
prose
with
a
triple
seal
by
those
three
cries
of
love
which
recall
the
hymn
to
the
affectionate
adoration
of
its
beginning
this
is
unprecedented
thought
durtal
as
the
trappists
chanted
these
sweet
and
eager
appeals
the
neumes
were
prolonged
on
the
os
which
passed
through
all
the
colours
of
the
soul
through
the
whole
register
of
sound
and
these
interjections
summed
up
again
in
the
series
of
notes
which
clothed
them
the
inventory
of
the
human
soul
which
now
recapitulated
the
whole
body
of
the
hymn
and
suddenly
at
the
word
maria
at
the
glorious
cry
of
that
name
the
chant
fell
the
tapers
were
extinguished
the
monks
fell
on
their
knees
a
silence
like
death
came
upon
the
chapel
the
bells
rang
slowly
and
the
angelus
unfolded
under
the
arches
the
separated
petals
of
its
clear
sounds
all
now
prostrate
their
faces
buried
in
their
hands
were
praying
and
this
lasted
long
then
the
sound
of
the
little
was
heard
everyone
rose
genuflected
to
the
altar
and
in
silent
file
the
monks
disappeared
through
the
door
in
the
apse
ah
the
true
creator
of
plain
music
the
unknown
author
who
cast
into
the
brain
of
man
the
seed
of
plain
chant
was
the
holy
ghost
said
durtal
sick
and
dazzled
with
tears
in
his
eyes
bruno
whom
he
had
not
noticed
in
the
chapel
came
and
joined
him
they
crossed
the
court
without
speaking
and
when
they
had
entered
the
bruno
lighted
two
candles
gave
one
to
durtal
and
said
gravely
i
wish
you
a
good
night
sir
durtal
went
up
the
staircase
behind
him
they
bowed
again
on
the
landing
and
durtal
entered
his
cell
the
wind
blew
under
the
door
and
the
room
scarcely
lighted
by
the
low
flame
of
the
candle
seemed
to
him
gloomy
the
high
ceiling
vanished
in
shadow
and
rained
down
darkness
durtal
sat
down
by
his
bed
discouraged
and
yet
he
was
thrust
forward
by
one
of
those
impulses
it
is
impossible
to
translate
into
words
in
which
it
seems
that
the
heart
swells
almost
to
bursting
and
before
his
inability
to
get
away
and
fly
from
self
durtal
ended
by
becoming
a
child
again
by
weeping
without
definite
cause
simply
from
the
need
of
relieving
himself
by
tears
he
sank
down
at
the
expecting
he
knew
not
what
which
never
came
then
before
the
crucifix
which
stretched
its
arms
above
him
he
began
to
speak
to
him
and
to
say
to
him
in
low
tones
father
i
have
driven
the
swine
from
my
being
but
they
have
trampled
on
me
and
covered
me
with
mire
and
the
very
stye
is
in
ruins
have
pity
on
me
for
i
return
from
a
distant
land
have
mercy
o
lord
on
the
without
a
house
i
have
entered
into
thy
house
do
not
send
me
away
be
to
me
a
kindly
host
wash
me
ah
he
said
suddenly
that
reminds
me
that
i
have
not
seen
father
etienne
who
was
to
tell
me
the
hour
at
which
the
confessor
would
receive
me
he
has
no
doubt
forgotten
to
ask
him
so
much
the
better
at
any
rate
it
will
put
it
off
for
a
day
my
soul
is
so
cramped
that
i
have
indeed
need
of
rest
he
undressed
sighing
i
must
be
up
at
three
to
be
in
the
chapel
at
four
i
have
no
time
to
lose
if
i
wish
to
sleep
if
only
i
have
no
neuralgia
and
can
wake
before
dawn
chapter
ii
he
passed
a
most
terrible
night
it
was
so
special
so
dreadful
that
he
did
not
remember
in
the
whole
of
his
existence
to
have
endured
such
anguish
undergone
the
like
fears
it
was
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
sudden
wakings
and
of
nightmares
and
these
nightmares
overpassed
the
limits
of
abomination
that
the
most
dangerous
madness
dreams
they
developed
themselves
in
the
realm
of
lust
and
they
were
so
special
so
new
to
him
that
when
he
woke
durtal
remained
trembling
almost
crying
out
it
was
not
at
all
that
involuntary
and
well
known
act
that
vision
which
ceases
just
at
the
moment
when
the
sleeper
clasps
an
amorous
form
it
was
as
and
more
complete
than
in
nature
long
and
accomplished
accompanied
by
all
the
preludes
all
the
details
all
the
sensations
and
the
orgasm
took
place
with
a
singularly
painful
acuteness
an
incredible
spasm
a
strange
fact
which
seemed
to
point
the
difference
between
this
state
and
the
unconscious
uncleanness
of
night
was
beyond
certain
episodes
and
caresses
which
could
only
follow
each
other
in
reality
but
were
united
at
the
same
moment
in
the
dream
the
sensation
clear
and
precise
of
a
being
of
a
fluid
form
disappearing
with
the
sharp
sound
of
a
percussion
cap
or
the
crack
of
a
whip
close
by
on
waking
this
being
was
felt
near
him
so
distinctly
that
the
sheet
disarranged
by
the
wind
of
the
flight
was
still
in
motion
and
he
looked
at
the
empty
place
in
terror
ah
thought
durtal
when
he
had
lighted
his
candle
this
carries
me
back
to
the
time
when
i
used
to
visit
madame
chantelouve
and
reminds
me
of
the
stories
of
the
succubus
he
remained
sitting
up
in
bed
astonished
and
looked
with
real
uneasiness
round
the
cell
steeped
in
shadow
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
only
eleven
at
night
god
he
said
if
the
nights
are
always
like
this
in
monasteries
he
had
recourse
to
bathing
with
cold
water
in
order
to
recover
himself
opened
his
window
to
change
the
air
and
lay
down
again
thoroughly
chilled
he
hesitated
to
blow
out
his
candle
uneasy
at
the
darkness
which
seemed
to
him
inhabited
full
of
ambushes
and
threats
he
decided
at
last
to
extinguish
it
and
repeated
the
stanza
he
had
already
heard
sung
that
evening
in
chapel
procul
recedant
somnia
et
noctium
phantasmata
hostemque
nostrum
comprime
ne
polluantur
corpora
he
ended
by
falling
asleep
and
dreamt
again
of
impurity
but
he
came
to
himself
in
time
to
break
the
charm
experiencing
again
the
impression
of
a
shadow
evaporating
before
he
could
seize
it
in
the
sheets
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
two
if
this
goes
on
i
shall
be
broken
down
he
thought
but
he
succeeded
somehow
or
other
in
dozing
and
waking
every
ten
minutes
to
wait
for
three
if
i
fall
asleep
again
i
shall
not
be
able
to
wake
at
the
moment
i
wish
he
thought
suppose
i
get
up
he
sprang
out
of
bed
dressed
prayed
reduced
his
thoughts
to
order
real
excesses
would
have
exhausted
him
less
than
these
sham
freaks
but
what
seemed
to
him
especially
odious
was
the
want
of
satisfaction
left
by
the
completed
rape
of
these
ghosts
compared
with
their
greedy
tricks
the
caresses
of
a
woman
only
diffused
a
temperate
pleasure
and
ended
in
a
feeble
shock
but
with
this
succuba
one
remained
in
a
fury
at
having
clasped
only
the
void
at
having
been
the
dupe
of
a
lie
the
plaything
of
an
appearance
of
which
one
could
not
remember
the
form
or
the
features
it
necessarily
brought
with
it
the
desire
of
the
flesh
the
wish
to
clasp
a
real
body
and
durtal
began
to
think
of
florence
she
at
least
quenched
his
desires
and
did
not
leave
him
thus
panting
and
feverish
in
quest
of
he
knew
not
what
in
an
atmosphere
where
he
was
surrounded
spied
upon
by
an
unknown
whom
he
could
not
discern
by
a
phantom
he
could
not
escape
then
durtal
shook
himself
and
would
repulse
the
assault
of
these
memories
at
any
rate
i
will
go
and
breathe
the
fresh
air
and
smoke
a
cigarette
we
will
see
afterwards
he
descended
the
staircase
whose
walls
seemed
not
to
keep
their
place
and
danced
in
the
light
of
his
candle
threaded
the
corridors
blew
out
his
light
placed
the
candlestick
near
the
auditorium
and
rushed
out
it
was
pitch
dark
at
the
height
of
the
first
story
a
round
window
in
the
wall
of
the
chapel
cut
a
hole
through
the
darkness
like
a
red
moon
durtal
took
a
few
whiffs
of
a
cigarette
and
then
made
his
way
to
the
chapel
he
turned
the
latch
of
the
door
gently
the
vestibule
into
which
he
entered
was
dark
but
the
apse
though
it
was
empty
was
lighted
by
numerous
lamps
he
made
a
step
crossed
himself
and
fell
back
for
he
had
stumbled
over
a
body
and
he
looked
down
at
his
feet
he
had
come
upon
a
on
the
ground
human
forms
were
lying
in
the
attitudes
of
combatants
mowed
down
by
grape
shot
some
flat
on
their
faces
others
on
their
knees
some
leaning
their
hands
on
the
ground
as
if
stricken
from
behind
others
extended
with
their
fingers
clenched
on
their
breast
others
again
holding
their
heads
or
stretching
out
their
arms
and
from
this
group
in
their
agony
rose
no
groan
no
complaint
durtal
was
stupefied
as
he
looked
at
this
massacre
of
monks
and
suddenly
stopped
with
open
mouth
a
shaft
of
light
fell
from
a
lamp
which
the
father
sacristan
had
just
placed
in
the
apse
and
crossing
the
porch
it
showed
a
monk
on
his
knees
before
the
altar
dedicated
to
the
virgin
he
was
an
old
man
of
more
than
years
motionless
as
a
statue
his
eyes
fixed
leaning
forward
in
such
an
access
of
adoration
that
the
faces
in
ecstasy
in
the
early
masters
seemed
compared
with
his
forced
and
cold
yet
his
features
were
vulgar
his
shaven
skull
without
a
crown
tanned
by
many
suns
and
rains
was
his
eye
was
dim
covered
with
a
film
by
age
his
face
was
wrinkled
shrivelled
stained
like
an
old
log
hidden
in
a
thicket
of
white
hair
while
his
somewhat
snub
nose
made
the
general
effect
of
the
face
singularly
common
but
there
went
out
not
from
his
eyes
nor
his
mouth
but
from
everywhere
and
nowhere
a
kind
of
angelic
look
which
was
diffused
over
his
head
and
enveloped
all
his
poor
body
bowed
in
its
heap
of
rags
in
this
old
man
the
soul
did
not
even
give
herself
the
trouble
to
reform
and
ennoble
his
features
she
contented
herself
in
annihilating
them
with
her
rays
it
was
as
it
were
the
nimbus
of
the
old
saints
not
now
remaining
round
the
head
but
extending
over
all
the
features
pale
and
almost
invisible
bathing
his
whole
being
he
saw
nothing
and
heard
nothing
monks
dragged
themselves
on
their
knees
came
to
warm
themselves
and
to
take
shelter
near
him
and
he
never
moved
dumb
and
deaf
so
rigid
that
you
might
have
believed
him
dead
had
not
his
lower
lip
stirred
now
and
then
lifting
in
this
movement
his
long
beard
the
dawn
whitened
the
windows
and
as
the
darkness
was
gradually
dissipated
the
other
brethren
were
visible
in
turn
to
durtal
all
these
men
wounded
by
divine
love
prayed
ardently
flashed
out
beyond
themselves
noiselessly
before
the
altar
some
were
quite
young
on
their
knees
with
their
bodies
upright
others
their
eyeballs
in
ecstasy
were
leaning
back
and
seated
on
their
heels
others
again
were
making
the
way
of
the
cross
and
were
often
placed
each
opposite
another
face
to
face
and
they
looked
without
seeing
as
with
the
eyes
of
the
blind
and
among
these
lay
brethren
some
fathers
buried
in
their
great
white
cowls
lay
prostrate
and
kissed
the
ground
oh
to
pray
pray
like
these
monks
cried
durtal
within
himself
he
felt
his
unhappy
soul
grow
slack
within
him
in
this
atmosphere
of
sanctity
he
unbent
himself
and
sank
down
on
the
pavement
humbly
asking
pardon
from
christ
for
having
soiled
by
his
presence
the
purity
of
this
place
he
prayed
long
unsealing
himself
for
the
first
time
recognizing
his
unworthiness
and
vileness
so
that
he
could
not
imagine
how
in
spite
of
his
mercy
the
lord
could
tolerate
him
in
the
little
circle
of
his
elect
he
examined
himself
saw
clearly
and
avowed
that
he
was
inferior
to
the
least
of
these
lay
brothers
who
perhaps
could
not
even
spell
out
a
book
understood
that
the
culture
of
the
mind
was
naught
and
the
culture
of
the
soul
was
all
and
little
by
little
without
perceiving
it
thinking
only
of
stammering
forth
acts
of
gratitude
he
disappeared
from
the
chapel
his
soul
borne
up
by
the
souls
of
others
away
away
from
the
world
far
from
his
far
from
his
body
in
this
chapel
the
impulse
had
come
at
last
the
going
forth
from
self
till
now
refused
was
at
last
permitted
he
no
longer
strove
with
self
as
in
the
time
when
he
escaped
with
so
great
difficulty
from
his
as
at
severin
or
notre
dame
des
victoires
then
he
again
realized
this
chapel
where
his
animal
part
had
alone
remained
and
he
looked
round
him
with
astonishment
the
greater
part
of
the
brethren
had
gone
one
father
remained
prostrate
before
our
altar
he
quitted
it
in
his
turn
and
went
back
to
the
apse
as
the
other
fathers
entered
it
durtal
looked
at
them
they
were
of
all
sizes
and
all
kinds
one
fat
and
bald
with
a
long
black
beard
and
spectacles
some
little
fair
and
puffy
men
some
very
old
bristling
with
skin
like
a
wild
boar
others
very
young
with
a
vague
air
of
german
dreaminess
with
their
eyes
under
their
glasses
and
almost
all
except
the
very
young
had
this
feature
in
common
a
large
belly
and
cheeks
with
little
red
streaks
suddenly
through
the
open
door
in
the
apse
itself
appeared
the
tall
monk
who
had
conducted
the
office
the
evening
before
he
threw
back
on
his
chasuble
the
woollen
hood
which
covered
his
head
and
assisted
by
two
white
monks
went
up
to
the
high
altar
to
say
mass
and
it
was
not
one
of
those
masses
served
as
so
many
are
cooked
in
paris
but
a
mass
slow
meditated
and
profound
a
mass
where
the
priest
takes
long
to
consecrate
overwhelmed
before
the
altar
and
when
he
elevated
the
host
no
little
bell
tinkled
but
the
bells
of
the
monastery
spread
abroad
their
slow
peal
brief
dull
strokes
almost
plaintive
while
the
trappists
disappeared
crouched
on
their
heads
hidden
below
their
desks
when
the
mass
ended
it
was
nearly
six
durtal
took
the
same
way
as
the
evening
before
passed
before
the
little
chocolate
factory
and
saw
through
the
windows
the
fathers
wrapping
up
the
tablets
in
lead
paper
and
in
another
room
a
tiny
steam
engine
which
a
lay
brother
was
directing
he
reached
the
walk
where
he
had
smoked
the
cigarettes
in
the
shade
so
gloomy
at
night
it
was
now
charming
with
its
two
rows
of
aged
limes
which
rustled
gently
while
the
wind
wafted
to
him
their
enervating
scent
seated
on
a
bench
he
could
see
at
a
glance
the
whole
front
of
the
abbey
before
it
was
a
long
kitchen
garden
with
here
and
there
some
rose
trees
spread
over
the
blueish
basins
and
large
balls
of
cabbages
and
the
old
house
built
in
the
monumental
style
of
the
seventeenth
century
extended
solemn
and
immense
with
eighteen
windows
in
a
row
and
a
pediment
in
the
span
of
which
was
placed
a
mighty
clock
it
was
roofed
with
slate
and
surmounted
by
a
ring
of
small
bells
and
was
reached
by
a
flight
of
several
steps
it
reached
a
height
of
at
least
five
stories
though
it
had
in
reality
only
a
ground
and
a
first
floor
but
to
judge
by
the
unexpected
height
of
the
windows
the
rooms
had
to
accommodate
their
ceilings
to
the
vast
altitude
of
the
church
on
the
whole
the
building
was
striking
and
cold
more
apt
since
it
had
been
converted
into
a
convent
to
shelter
the
disciples
of
jansen
than
the
sons
of
saint
bernard
the
weather
was
warm
that
morning
the
sun
was
filtered
through
the
moving
sieve
of
foliage
and
the
daylight
thus
screened
was
changed
to
rose
colour
as
it
touched
the
white
durtal
who
was
about
to
read
his
saw
the
pages
growing
red
and
by
the
law
of
complementary
colours
all
the
letters
printed
in
black
ink
grew
green
he
was
amused
by
these
details
and
with
his
back
to
the
warmth
he
brightened
up
in
this
aromatic
breeze
rested
in
this
bath
of
sunshine
from
his
fatigues
of
the
night
when
at
the
end
of
the
walk
he
saw
some
of
the
brothers
they
walked
in
silence
some
carrying
under
their
arms
great
round
loaves
others
holding
milk
cans
or
baskets
full
of
hay
and
eggs
they
passed
before
him
and
bowed
respectfully
all
had
a
joyous
and
serious
aspect
ah
good
fellows
he
thought
for
they
helped
me
this
morning
it
is
to
them
i
owe
it
that
i
could
keep
silence
no
longer
and
was
able
to
pray
to
have
at
last
known
the
joy
of
supplication
which
at
paris
was
only
a
snare
for
me
to
them
and
above
all
to
our
lady
de
who
had
pity
on
my
poor
soul
he
sprang
from
his
bench
in
an
access
of
joy
went
into
the
lateral
walks
reached
the
piece
of
water
he
had
partially
seen
the
evening
before
in
front
of
it
rose
the
huge
cross
he
had
seen
at
a
distance
from
the
carriage
in
the
wood
before
he
reached
la
trappe
it
was
placed
opposite
the
monastery
itself
and
turned
its
back
upon
the
pond
it
bore
an
christ
of
natural
size
in
white
marble
the
pond
also
took
the
form
of
a
cross
such
as
is
shown
on
the
greater
part
of
the
plans
of
churches
this
brown
and
liquid
cross
was
spotted
by
duckweed
which
the
swan
displaced
as
he
swam
he
came
towards
durtal
with
extended
beak
expecting
no
doubt
a
piece
of
bread
not
a
sound
arose
in
this
deserted
spot
save
the
rustle
of
dry
leaves
which
durtal
brushed
as
he
walked
the
clock
struck
seven
he
remembered
that
breakfast
would
be
ready
and
he
walked
quickly
to
the
abbey
father
etienne
was
waiting
for
him
shook
hands
asked
if
he
had
slept
well
then
said
what
would
you
like
i
can
only
offer
you
milk
and
honey
i
will
send
to
the
nearest
village
and
try
to
get
you
a
little
cheese
but
you
will
have
only
a
poor
meal
this
morning
durtal
proposed
to
exchange
the
milk
for
wine
declaring
that
he
should
then
do
very
well
and
said
in
any
case
i
should
do
ill
to
complain
for
you
are
fasting
the
monk
smiled
just
now
he
said
we
are
doing
penance
on
account
of
certain
feasts
of
our
order
and
he
explained
that
he
only
took
food
once
a
day
at
two
in
the
afternoon
after
nones
and
you
have
not
even
wine
and
eggs
to
keep
up
your
strength
father
etienne
smiled
again
one
gets
accustomed
to
it
he
said
what
is
this
rule
in
comparison
with
that
adopted
by
saint
bernard
and
his
companions
when
they
went
to
till
the
valley
of
clairvaux
their
meal
consisted
of
oak
leaves
salted
cooked
in
muddy
water
and
after
a
silence
the
father
continued
no
doubt
the
trappist
rule
is
hard
but
it
is
mild
if
we
carry
our
thoughts
back
to
the
rule
of
saint
pacomius
in
the
east
only
think
whoever
wished
to
join
that
order
had
to
remain
ten
days
and
nights
at
the
door
of
the
convent
and
had
to
endure
spitting
and
insults
if
he
still
desired
to
enter
he
fulfilled
a
three
years
novitiate
inhabited
a
hut
where
he
could
not
stand
up
nor
lie
at
full
length
ate
only
olives
and
cabbage
prayed
twelve
times
in
the
morning
twelve
times
in
the
afternoon
twelve
times
in
the
night
the
silence
was
perpetual
and
his
mortifications
never
ceased
to
prepare
himself
for
this
novitiate
and
to
learn
to
subdue
his
appetite
saint
macarius
thought
of
the
plan
of
soaking
his
bread
in
a
vessel
with
a
very
narrow
neck
and
only
fed
on
the
crumbs
which
he
could
take
out
with
his
fingers
when
he
was
admitted
into
the
monastery
he
contented
himself
with
gnawing
leaves
of
raw
cabbage
on
sunday
ah
they
could
stand
more
than
we
we
alas
have
no
longer
souls
nor
bodies
stout
enough
to
bear
such
fasts
but
do
not
let
that
stop
your
meal
make
as
good
an
one
as
you
can
ah
by
the
way
said
the
monk
be
in
the
auditorium
at
ten
precisely
where
the
father
prior
will
hear
your
confession
and
he
left
the
room
if
durtal
had
received
a
blow
on
his
head
with
a
mallet
he
could
not
have
been
more
overwhelmed
all
the
scaffolding
of
his
joys
so
rapidly
run
up
fell
this
strange
fact
had
occurred
in
the
impulse
of
joy
he
had
felt
since
daybreak
he
had
wholly
forgotten
that
he
had
to
confess
he
had
a
moment
of
aberration
but
i
am
forgiven
he
thought
the
proof
is
that
state
of
happiness
such
as
i
have
never
known
that
truly
wonderful
expansion
of
soul
which
i
experienced
in
the
chapel
and
in
the
wood
the
idea
that
nothing
had
begun
that
all
was
still
to
do
terrified
him
he
had
not
the
courage
to
swallow
his
bread
he
drank
a
little
wine
and
rushed
out
of
doors
in
a
wind
of
panic
he
went
wildly
with
great
strides
confession
the
prior
who
was
the
prior
he
sought
in
vain
among
the
fathers
whose
faces
he
remembered
the
one
who
would
hear
him
my
god
he
said
all
at
once
but
i
do
not
even
know
how
a
confession
is
made
he
sought
a
deserted
corner
where
he
could
recollect
himself
a
little
he
was
striding
along
without
even
knowing
how
he
came
there
along
a
walk
with
a
wall
on
one
side
there
were
some
enormous
trees
he
hid
himself
behind
the
trunk
of
one
of
them
and
sitting
on
the
moss
turned
over
the
leaves
of
his
and
read
on
arriving
at
the
confessional
place
yourself
on
your
knees
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
ask
the
priest
for
his
blessing
saying
me
father
for
i
have
sinned
then
recite
the
confiteor
as
far
as
and
he
stopped
and
without
any
need
of
probing
it
his
life
sprang
out
in
jets
of
filth
he
shrank
from
it
there
was
so
much
of
every
kind
that
he
was
overwhelmed
with
despair
then
by
an
effort
of
his
will
he
pulled
himself
together
endeavoured
to
control
and
bank
up
these
torrents
to
separate
them
so
as
to
understand
them
but
one
affluent
rolled
back
all
the
others
ended
by
overwhelming
them
and
became
the
river
itself
and
this
sin
appeared
at
first
and
sly
at
school
where
everyone
tempted
and
corrupted
others
then
there
was
all
his
greedy
youth
dragged
through
rolled
in
swine
troughs
wallowing
in
the
sinks
of
prostitution
and
then
an
ignoble
manhood
to
his
regular
tasks
had
succeeded
toll
paid
to
his
senses
and
shameful
memories
assailed
him
in
a
crowd
he
recalled
to
mind
how
he
had
sought
after
monstrous
iniquities
his
pursuit
of
artifices
aggravating
the
malice
of
the
act
and
the
accomplices
and
agents
of
his
sins
passed
in
file
before
him
among
all
at
one
time
there
was
a
certain
mme
chantelouve
a
demoniacal
adulteress
who
had
drawn
him
headlong
into
frightful
excesses
who
had
linked
him
to
nameless
crimes
sins
against
holy
things
to
sacrileges
how
can
i
tell
all
this
to
the
monk
thought
durtal
terrified
by
the
remembrance
how
can
i
even
express
myself
so
as
to
make
him
understand
without
defilement
tears
rushed
from
his
eyes
my
god
my
god
he
sighed
this
is
indeed
too
much
and
in
her
turn
florence
appeared
with
her
little
smile
and
her
childish
haunches
i
can
never
tell
the
confessor
all
that
was
brewed
in
the
perfumed
shade
of
her
vices
cried
durtal
i
can
by
no
means
make
him
face
these
torrents
of
pus
yet
they
say
this
has
to
be
done
and
he
bowed
under
the
weight
of
the
foulness
of
this
girl
how
shameful
to
have
been
riveted
to
her
how
disgusting
to
have
satisfied
the
abominable
demands
of
her
desires
behind
this
sewer
extended
others
he
had
traversed
all
the
districts
of
sin
which
the
patiently
enumerated
he
had
never
confessed
since
his
first
communion
and
with
the
piling
up
of
years
had
come
successive
deposits
of
sins
he
grew
pale
at
the
thought
that
he
was
about
to
detail
to
another
man
all
his
dirt
to
acknowledge
his
most
secret
thoughts
to
say
to
him
what
one
dares
not
repeat
to
one
own
self
lest
one
should
despise
oneself
too
much
he
sweated
with
anguish
then
nausea
at
his
being
remorse
for
his
life
solaced
him
and
he
gave
himself
up
regret
for
having
lived
so
long
in
this
cesspool
was
a
very
crucifixion
to
him
he
wept
long
doubting
pardon
not
even
daring
to
ask
it
so
vile
did
he
feel
himself
at
last
he
sprang
up
the
hour
of
expiation
must
be
at
hand
in
fact
his
watch
pointed
to
a
quarter
to
ten
his
agony
as
he
thus
wrought
with
himself
had
lasted
more
than
two
hours
he
hurriedly
reached
the
main
path
which
led
to
the
monastery
he
walked
with
his
head
down
forcing
back
his
tears
he
slackened
his
pace
somewhat
as
he
drew
near
the
little
pond
he
lifted
his
eyes
in
supplication
to
the
cross
and
as
he
lowered
them
he
met
a
look
so
moved
so
compassionate
so
gentle
that
he
stopped
and
the
look
disappeared
with
the
bow
of
a
lay
brother
who
passed
on
his
way
he
read
my
thoughts
said
durtal
to
himself
oh
this
charitable
monk
has
good
reason
to
pity
me
for
indeed
i
suffer
ah
lord
that
i
might
be
like
that
humble
brother
he
cried
remembering
that
he
had
seen
that
very
morning
the
young
tall
lad
praying
in
the
chapel
with
such
fervour
that
he
seemed
to
rise
from
the
ground
before
our
lady
he
arrived
at
the
auditorium
in
a
frightful
state
and
sank
on
a
chair
then
like
a
hunted
animal
that
thinks
itself
discovered
he
sprang
up
and
disturbed
by
his
fears
moved
by
a
wind
of
disorder
he
thought
of
flight
that
he
would
pack
his
bag
and
make
for
the
train
he
mastered
himself
undecided
and
trembling
his
ear
on
the
watch
his
heart
beating
with
great
strokes
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
distant
steps
my
god
he
said
waiting
for
the
steps
that
drew
near
what
manner
of
monk
is
coming
the
steps
were
silent
and
the
door
opened
durtal
in
his
alarm
dared
not
look
at
the
confessor
in
whom
he
recognized
the
tall
trappist
with
the
imperious
profile
whom
he
believed
to
be
the
abbot
of
the
monastery
his
breath
was
taken
away
and
he
drew
back
without
saying
a
word
surprised
at
this
silence
the
prior
said
you
have
asked
to
make
your
confession
sir
and
at
a
sign
from
durtal
he
pointed
out
the
placed
against
the
wall
and
himself
knelt
down
turning
his
back
durtal
braced
himself
fell
down
at
the
and
then
completely
lost
his
head
he
had
vaguely
prepared
how
to
enter
on
the
matter
noted
the
points
of
his
statement
classified
his
sins
in
some
degree
and
now
remembered
nothing
the
monk
rose
sat
down
on
a
straw
chair
leant
towards
the
penitent
his
hand
behind
his
ear
to
hear
the
better
he
waited
durtal
wished
rather
to
die
than
speak
he
succeeded
however
in
mastering
himself
and
bridling
his
shame
he
opened
his
lips
but
no
word
came
he
remained
overwhelmed
his
head
in
his
hands
repressing
the
tears
he
felt
ready
to
fall
the
monk
did
not
move
at
last
he
made
a
desperate
effort
stammered
the
beginning
of
the
confiteor
and
said
i
have
not
confessed
since
my
childhood
since
then
i
have
led
a
shameful
life
i
have
the
words
would
not
come
the
trappist
remained
silent
and
did
not
assist
him
at
all
i
have
committed
every
kind
of
debauch
i
have
done
everything
everything
he
choked
and
the
tears
he
had
repressed
flowed
he
wept
his
body
was
shaken
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
and
as
the
prior
still
bending
over
him
did
not
move
but
i
can
not
he
cried
i
can
not
all
that
life
he
could
not
bring
out
stifled
him
he
sobbed
in
despair
at
the
view
of
his
sins
and
crushed
also
at
finding
himself
thus
abandoned
without
a
word
of
kindness
without
help
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
was
giving
way
that
he
was
lost
repulsed
even
by
him
who
yet
had
directed
him
to
this
abbey
then
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
while
a
gentle
low
voice
said
your
soul
is
too
tired
for
me
to
fatigue
you
with
questions
come
back
at
nine
we
shall
have
time
before
us
we
shall
not
then
be
hurried
by
any
office
from
now
till
then
think
of
the
story
of
calvary
the
cross
which
was
made
for
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
lay
so
heavily
on
the
shoulders
of
the
saviour
that
his
knees
bent
and
he
fell
a
man
of
cyrene
passed
by
who
helped
the
lord
to
bear
it
you
in
detesting
in
weeping
for
your
sins
have
alleviated
and
rendered
lighter
if
one
may
say
so
the
cross
of
the
burthen
of
your
sins
and
having
made
it
less
heavy
have
thus
allowed
our
lord
to
lift
it
he
has
recompensed
you
by
the
most
astonishing
of
miracles
the
miracle
of
having
brought
you
here
from
so
far
off
thank
him
then
with
all
your
heart
and
be
not
discomforted
you
will
say
for
your
penance
the
penitential
psalms
and
the
litany
of
the
saints
i
will
give
you
my
blessing
and
the
prior
blessed
him
and
went
out
durtal
raised
himself
up
after
his
tears
what
he
feared
so
much
had
happened
the
monk
who
would
take
him
in
hand
was
impassive
almost
dumb
alas
he
thought
my
abscesses
are
ripe
but
it
needs
the
cut
of
a
lancet
to
open
them
after
all
he
went
on
as
he
went
upstairs
to
bathe
his
eyes
in
his
cell
this
trappist
was
compassionate
at
last
not
so
much
in
what
he
said
as
the
tone
in
which
he
said
it
then
to
be
just
he
was
perhaps
confused
by
my
tears
the
abbé
gévresin
certainly
did
not
tell
father
etienne
that
i
was
taking
refuge
in
la
trappe
in
order
to
be
converted
let
us
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
a
man
living
in
god
far
from
the
world
over
whose
head
a
shower
bath
is
suddenly
discharged
well
we
shall
see
and
durtal
made
haste
to
sponge
his
face
for
it
was
nearly
eleven
and
the
office
of
sext
was
about
to
begin
he
went
to
the
chapel
which
was
almost
empty
for
the
brothers
were
working
at
that
time
in
the
chocolate
factory
and
in
the
fields
the
fathers
were
in
their
places
in
the
apse
the
prior
struck
his
bell
all
signed
themselves
with
a
large
cross
and
on
the
left
where
he
could
not
see
for
durtal
had
taken
the
same
place
as
in
the
morning
near
saint
joseph
altar
a
voice
arose
ave
maria
gratia
plena
dominus
tecum
and
the
other
part
of
the
choir
answered
et
benedictus
fructus
ventris
tui
jesus
there
was
a
moment
pause
and
the
pure
thin
voice
of
the
old
trappist
sang
as
before
the
office
of
compline
the
evening
before
deus
in
adjutorium
meum
intende
and
the
liturgy
continued
its
course
with
its
gloria
patri
during
which
the
monks
bowed
their
foreheads
on
their
books
and
with
its
series
of
psalms
accented
in
short
tones
on
the
one
side
and
long
on
the
other
durtal
as
he
knelt
allowed
himself
to
be
rocked
by
the
psalmody
too
tired
to
be
able
to
pray
himself
then
when
sext
was
ended
all
the
fathers
meditated
and
durtal
caught
a
look
of
pity
from
the
prior
who
turned
a
little
towards
his
bench
he
understood
that
the
monk
implored
the
saviour
for
him
and
perhaps
asked
god
to
show
him
the
way
in
which
he
might
conduct
himself
on
the
morrow
durtal
rejoined
bruno
in
the
court
they
shook
hands
and
the
oblate
announced
the
presence
of
a
new
guest
a
retreatant
no
a
curate
from
the
neighbourhood
of
lyons
he
has
come
to
see
the
abbot
who
is
but
i
thought
the
abbot
of
notre
dame
de
was
the
tall
monk
who
led
the
office
oh
no
that
was
the
prior
father
maximin
you
have
not
seen
the
abbot
and
i
doubt
if
you
will
see
him
for
i
do
not
think
he
will
leave
his
bed
before
you
go
they
reached
the
and
found
father
etienne
making
excuses
to
a
short
fat
priest
for
the
poor
fare
he
could
offer
he
was
a
jovial
priest
with
strong
features
moulded
in
yellow
fat
he
joked
bruno
whom
he
seemed
to
have
known
some
time
on
the
sin
of
gluttony
which
must
so
often
be
committed
at
la
trappe
then
tasted
pretending
a
chuckle
of
delight
the
scentless
bouquet
of
the
poor
wine
he
poured
out
and
lastly
when
he
divided
with
a
spoon
the
omelette
which
was
the
main
dish
of
their
dinner
he
pretended
to
cut
up
a
fowl
and
to
be
delighted
with
the
fine
appearance
of
the
flesh
saying
to
durtal
this
is
a
fowl
may
i
offer
you
a
wing
this
kind
of
pleasantry
exasperated
durtal
who
had
no
wish
to
laugh
that
day
he
therefore
was
satisfied
to
make
a
vague
bow
wishing
to
himself
that
the
end
of
dinner
was
at
hand
the
conversation
continued
between
the
priest
and
bruno
after
it
had
spread
over
various
commonplaces
it
took
a
more
definite
form
in
regard
to
an
invisible
otter
which
plundered
the
abbey
ponds
but
no
doubt
said
the
curate
you
have
found
its
lair
never
it
is
easy
to
see
in
the
lain
grass
the
paths
it
traverses
to
get
to
the
water
but
we
always
lose
its
traces
at
the
same
spot
we
have
watched
for
days
with
father
etienne
but
it
has
never
shown
itself
the
abbé
explained
various
traps
which
might
be
set
with
advantage
durtal
thought
of
the
which
balzac
tells
so
pleasantly
at
the
beginning
of
his
paysans
when
the
dinner
came
to
an
end
the
curate
said
grace
and
said
to
bruno
suppose
we
take
a
turn
the
fresh
air
will
do
instead
of
the
coffee
which
they
forget
to
give
us
durtal
returned
to
his
cell
he
felt
himself
emptied
injured
cheated
reduced
to
a
state
of
fibre
a
state
of
pulp
his
body
crushed
by
the
nightmares
of
the
night
enervated
by
the
scene
of
the
morning
needed
entire
rest
and
if
his
soul
had
not
still
that
infatuation
which
had
broken
it
in
tears
at
the
monk
feet
it
was
sad
and
restless
and
it
also
asked
for
silence
repose
and
sleep
let
us
see
said
durtal
i
must
not
give
way
let
me
bestir
myself
he
read
the
penitential
psalms
and
the
litanies
of
the
saints
then
he
hesitated
between
two
volumes
of
saint
bonaventure
and
saint
angela
he
decided
on
the
blessed
angela
she
had
sinned
and
had
been
converted
and
she
seemed
less
far
from
him
more
intelligible
more
helpful
than
the
seraphic
doctor
than
a
saint
who
had
always
remained
pure
sheltered
from
falls
for
she
too
had
been
a
carnal
sinner
she
too
had
reached
the
saviour
from
afar
a
married
woman
she
lived
in
adultery
and
shame
lovers
succeeded
one
another
and
when
she
had
exhausted
them
she
threw
them
aside
like
husks
suddenly
grace
rose
in
her
and
made
her
soul
break
forth
she
went
to
confession
not
daring
to
avow
the
more
awful
of
her
sins
and
she
communicated
thus
grafting
sacrilege
upon
her
other
faults
she
lived
day
and
night
tortured
by
remorse
and
finally
prayed
to
saint
francis
of
assisi
to
help
her
and
the
next
night
the
saint
appeared
to
her
my
sister
he
said
if
you
had
called
on
me
sooner
i
should
have
granted
your
prayer
before
this
the
next
day
she
went
to
church
heard
a
priest
preaching
understood
she
must
address
herself
to
him
and
laid
all
before
him
in
a
full
confession
then
began
the
trials
of
an
appalling
life
of
purification
in
blow
after
blow
she
lost
her
mother
her
husband
her
children
she
went
through
such
violent
temptations
to
impurity
that
she
was
obliged
to
seize
on
lighted
coals
and
cauterize
the
plague
of
her
senses
with
fire
during
two
years
the
demon
sifted
her
she
parted
her
goods
among
the
poor
assumed
the
habit
of
the
third
order
of
saint
francis
gathered
in
the
sick
and
infirm
and
begged
for
them
in
the
streets
one
day
a
feeling
of
sickness
came
over
her
before
a
leper
whose
sores
were
stinking
to
punish
herself
she
drank
the
water
in
which
she
had
washed
the
sores
she
was
overcome
with
nausea
and
punished
herself
yet
more
by
forcing
herself
to
swallow
a
scab
which
had
not
gone
down
with
the
water
and
remained
dry
in
her
throat
for
years
she
dressed
ulcers
and
meditated
on
the
passion
of
christ
then
her
novitiate
of
sorrows
drew
to
a
close
and
a
radiant
day
of
visions
dawned
on
her
jesus
treated
her
as
a
spoilt
child
called
her
my
sweetest
my
daughter
he
dispensed
her
from
the
necessity
of
eating
and
nourished
her
only
with
the
sacred
species
he
called
her
drew
her
absorbed
her
in
uncreated
light
and
by
anticipating
her
inheritance
enabled
her
to
understand
in
life
the
joys
of
heaven
and
she
was
so
simple
and
timid
that
she
feared
in
spite
of
all
for
the
memory
of
her
sins
alarmed
her
she
could
not
believe
herself
forgiven
and
said
to
christ
ah
if
i
could
but
put
myself
in
an
iron
collar
and
drag
myself
to
the
to
proclaim
my
shame
and
he
consoled
her
be
easy
my
daughter
my
sufferings
have
atoned
for
your
sins
and
as
she
reproached
herself
for
having
lived
in
opulence
and
having
delighted
in
clothes
and
jewels
he
addressed
her
smiling
to
buy
you
riches
i
have
wanted
for
everything
you
required
a
great
number
of
clothes
and
i
had
but
one
garment
of
which
the
soldiers
stripped
me
for
which
they
drew
lots
my
nakedness
was
the
expiation
of
your
vanity
in
ornaments
and
all
her
conversations
with
christ
were
in
this
tone
he
passed
his
time
in
comforting
this
humble
creature
whom
his
benefits
overwhelmed
and
this
has
made
her
the
most
loving
of
the
saints
her
work
is
a
succession
of
spiritual
outpourings
and
caresses
her
book
is
such
a
living
hearth
that
beside
it
the
volumes
of
other
mystics
seem
but
dull
coal
ah
said
durtal
to
himself
in
turning
over
these
pages
it
was
indeed
the
christ
of
saint
francis
the
god
of
mercy
who
spoke
to
this
franciscan
and
he
went
on
that
ought
to
give
me
courage
for
angela
of
foligno
was
as
great
a
sinner
as
i
am
but
all
her
sins
were
remitted
yes
but
then
what
a
soul
she
had
while
mine
is
good
for
nothing
instead
of
loving
i
reason
nevertheless
it
is
right
to
remember
that
the
conditions
of
the
blessed
angela
were
more
favourable
than
mine
living
in
the
thirteenth
century
she
had
a
shorter
journey
to
make
to
approach
god
for
since
the
middle
ages
each
century
takes
us
further
from
him
she
lived
in
a
time
full
of
miracles
which
overflowed
with
saints
for
me
i
live
in
paris
in
an
age
when
miracles
are
rare
and
saints
scarcely
abound
and
once
away
from
here
what
a
vista
is
before
me
of
falling
away
of
soaking
myself
in
a
stew
of
infamy
in
a
bath
of
the
sins
of
great
cities
by
the
way
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
started
it
was
two
i
have
missed
the
office
of
nones
he
said
i
must
simplify
my
complicated
horary
or
i
shall
never
know
where
i
am
and
at
once
he
traced
in
a
few
lines
morning
rise
at
or
rather
at
breakfast
at
sext
at
dinner
at
nones
at
vespers
at
supper
at
and
compline
at
there
at
least
that
is
clear
and
easy
to
remember
if
only
father
etienne
have
not
noticed
my
absence
from
chapel
he
left
his
room
ah
here
is
the
famous
rule
he
said
to
himself
on
seeing
a
framed
table
hung
on
the
landing
he
approached
and
read
rule
for
visitors
it
was
composed
of
numerous
paragraphs
and
opened
as
follows
those
whom
divine
providence
has
guided
to
this
monastery
are
requested
to
note
the
following
they
will
at
all
times
avoid
meeting
the
religious
and
lay
brothers
and
will
not
go
near
their
places
of
work
they
are
forbidden
to
leave
the
cloister
for
the
farm
or
the
neighbourhood
of
the
monastery
then
came
a
series
of
instructions
which
he
had
already
seen
on
the
printed
horary
durtal
skipped
several
paragraphs

thought
durtal
but
i
want
a
cigarette
badly
and
he
went
down
in
the
corridor
he
ran
against
father
etienne
who
immediately
observed
that
he
had
not
seen
him
in
his
place
during
the
office
durtal
excused
himself
as
well
as
he
could
the
monk
said
no
more
but
durtal
understood
that
he
was
observed
and
that
under
his
childlike
aspect
the
would
where
discipline
was
concerned
hold
him
in
an
iron
grip
he
was
confirmed
in
this
impression
when
at
vespers
he
noticed
that
the
monk
first
glance
on
entering
the
chapel
was
at
him
but
that
day
he
felt
so
sore
and
broken
that
he
cared
but
little
this
sudden
change
of
existence
and
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
spend
his
time
astounded
him
and
since
the
crisis
of
the
morning
he
had
been
in
a
kind
of
torpor
which
took
from
him
all
power
of
recovery
he
drifted
to
the
end
of
the
day
no
longer
thinking
of
anything
sleeping
as
he
stood
and
when
the
evening
came
he
fell
on
his
bed
a
mere
inert
mass
chapter
iii
he
woke
with
a
bound
at
eleven
with
an
impression
of
someone
looking
at
him
in
his
sleep
lighting
a
match
he
ascertained
the
time
and
seeing
no
one
fell
back
in
bed
again
and
slept
at
a
stretch
till
four
then
he
dressed
himself
in
haste
and
ran
to
the
church
the
vestibule
which
had
been
dark
on
the
previous
evening
was
lit
up
that
morning
for
an
old
monk
was
celebrating
mass
at
the
altar
of
joseph
he
was
bald
and
infirm
with
a
white
beard
waving
from
side
to
side
in
long
threads
with
every
gust
of
wind
a
lay
brother
was
assisting
him
a
small
man
with
black
hair
and
a
shaven
head
like
a
ball
painted
blue
he
looked
like
a
bandit
with
his
beard
in
disorder
and
his
robe
of
felt
and
the
eyes
of
this
bandit
were
gentle
and
startled
like
those
of
a
little
boy
he
served
the
priest
with
an
almost
timid
respect
and
a
suppressed
joy
which
was
touching
to
see
others
kneeling
on
the
flagstones
prayed
with
concentrated
attention
or
read
their
mass
durtal
noticed
the
old
man
of
eighty
immovable
with
outstretched
face
and
closed
eyes
and
the
youth
whose
look
of
pity
had
helped
him
near
the
pond
was
following
the
office
in
his
with
attentive
meditation
he
looked
about
twenty
years
old
tall
and
strong
his
face
with
an
air
of
fatigue
was
at
once
masculine
and
tender
with
emaciated
features
and
a
light
beard
which
fell
over
his
habit
in
a
point
durtal
gave
way
to
his
emotions
in
this
chapel
where
everyone
did
a
little
to
help
him
and
thinking
of
the
confession
he
was
about
to
make
he
implored
the
saviour
to
help
him
and
prayed
that
the
monk
would
completely
explore
his
soul
and
he
felt
himself
less
dismayed
more
master
of
himself
and
firmer
he
collected
and
pulled
himself
together
feeling
a
melancholy
confusion
but
he
had
no
longer
the
sense
of
desolation
which
had
overcome
him
the
evening
before
he
set
his
mind
on
the
idea
that
he
would
not
abandon
himself
that
he
would
help
himself
with
all
his
might
and
that
in
any
case
he
could
not
collect
himself
better
these
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
departure
of
the
old
trappist
who
had
finished
offering
the
sacrifice
and
by
the
entry
of
the
prior
who
went
up
in
the
rotunda
between
two
white
fathers
to
say
mass
at
the
high
altar
durtal
was
absorbed
in
his
but
he
ceased
reading
when
the
priest
had
consumed
the
species
for
all
rose
and
he
was
amazed
at
a
sight
of
which
he
had
never
dreamed
a
communion
of
monks
they
advanced
in
single
file
silent
and
with
downcast
eyes
and
when
the
first
arrived
before
the
altar
he
turned
round
to
embrace
the
comrade
who
followed
he
in
turn
took
in
his
arms
the
religious
who
followed
him
and
so
on
to
the
last
all
before
receiving
the
eucharist
exchanged
the
kiss
of
peace
then
they
knelt
communicated
and
came
back
in
single
file
turning
into
the
rotunda
behind
the
altar
and
the
return
was
unexpected
with
the
white
fathers
at
the
head
of
the
line
they
made
their
way
very
slowly
with
closed
eyes
and
joined
hands
the
faces
seemed
to
be
somewhat
altered
they
were
differently
lit
from
within
it
seemed
that
the
soul
driven
by
the
power
of
the
sacrament
against
the
sides
of
the
body
filtered
through
the
pores
and
lit
up
the
skin
with
a
special
light
of
joy
with
that
kind
of
brightness
which
pours
from
white
souls
and
makes
way
like
a
vapour
along
the
cheeks
and
shines
as
if
concentrated
on
the
brow
watching
the
mechanical
and
hesitating
gait
of
these
monks
it
seemed
as
if
their
bodies
were
no
more
than
automata
moving
from
habit
and
that
the
souls
being
elsewhere
gave
no
heed
to
them
durtal
recognized
the
old
lay
brother
bent
so
much
that
his
face
disappeared
in
his
beard
which
pressed
against
his
chest
and
his
two
great
knotty
hands
trembled
as
he
clasped
them
he
also
noticed
the
tall
young
brother
his
features
seeming
drawn
on
a
dissolved
surface
gliding
with
short
steps
his
eyes
closed
by
a
fatal
chance
he
thought
upon
himself
he
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
communicate
for
he
saw
bruno
coming
last
from
behind
the
altar
and
returning
to
his
place
with
folded
arms
this
exclusion
brought
home
to
him
clearly
how
different
he
was
and
how
far
apart
from
those
around
him
all
were
admitted
and
he
alone
remained
outside
his
unworthiness
was
more
apparent
and
he
grew
sad
at
being
put
aside
looked
on
as
he
deserved
to
be
as
a
stranger
separated
like
the
goat
of
the
scriptures
penned
far
from
the
sheep
on
the
left
of
christ
these
reflections
were
of
use
to
him
for
they
relieved
him
of
the
terror
of
confession
which
was
again
coming
over
him
this
act
seemed
to
him
so
natural
and
just
in
his
necessary
humiliation
and
unavoidable
suffering
that
a
desire
came
over
him
to
accomplish
it
at
once
so
that
he
might
appear
in
this
chapel
purified
and
washed
and
with
at
least
some
resemblance
to
the
others
when
the
mass
was
over
he
made
his
way
towards
his
cell
to
get
a
tablet
of
chocolate
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
bruno
with
a
large
apron
round
him
was
getting
ready
to
clean
the
steps
durtal
looked
on
him
with
surprise
the
oblate
smiled
and
shook
hands
with
him
this
is
an
excellent
task
for
the
soul
he
said
showing
his
broom
it
recalls
modest
sentiments
which
one
is
too
inclined
to
forget
after
living
in
the
world
and
he
began
sweeping
vigorously
and
collecting
into
a
pan
the
dust
which
like
pepper
filled
every
crevice
in
the
floor
durtal
carried
his
tablet
into
the
garden
let
us
consider
he
said
to
himself
as
he
nibbled
it
supposing
i
took
another
walk
and
tried
an
unknown
part
of
the
wood
and
he
felt
no
wish
to
do
so
no
placed
as
i
am
i
would
rather
haunt
the
same
spot
and
not
leave
the
places
to
which
i
am
accustomed
i
am
already
so
little
under
control
and
so
easily
disturbed
that
i
do
not
wish
to
risk
anything
by
curiosity
to
see
new
places
and
he
went
down
to
the
cross
pond
he
went
along
the
banks
and
having
reached
the
end
was
astonished
to
find
a
few
steps
farther
a
stream
spotted
with
green
pellicules
hollowing
its
way
between
two
hedges
which
fenced
in
the
monastery
the
fields
stretched
out
beyond
and
the
roofs
of
a
large
farmhouse
were
visible
in
the
trees
and
all
round
the
horizon
on
hills
were
forests
which
seemed
to
stop
the
way
before
the
sky
i
imagined
the
grounds
were
larger
he
said
to
himself
retracing
his
steps
and
having
reached
the
end
of
the
cross
pond
he
gazed
on
the
huge
wooden
crucifix
reared
in
the
air
which
was
reflected
in
that
black
mirror
it
sank
down
seen
from
behind
trembling
in
the
small
waves
stirred
up
by
the
breeze
and
seemed
to
fall
whirling
round
in
that
stretch
of
ink
and
as
the
body
of
the
marble
christ
was
hidden
by
the
wood
only
the
two
white
arms
which
hung
below
the
tree
could
be
seen
twisted
in
the
blackness
of
the
water
seated
on
the
grass
durtal
gazed
on
the
hazy
image
of
the
recumbent
cross
and
thinking
of
his
soul
which
like
the
pond
was
tanned
and
stained
by
a
bed
of
dead
leaves
and
a
dunghill
of
sins
he
pitied
the
saviour
whom
he
was
about
to
invite
to
bathe
himself
there
for
it
would
no
longer
be
the
martyr
of
golgotha
to
whom
at
all
events
death
came
on
a
hill
his
head
high
by
daylight
in
the
open
air
but
it
would
be
by
an
increase
of
outrages
the
abominable
plunging
of
the
crucified
body
the
head
low
by
night
into
a
depth
of
mud
ah
it
would
be
time
to
spare
him
in
filtering
and
clarifying
me
he
cried
to
himself
and
the
swan
till
then
motionless
in
an
arm
of
the
pond
swept
over
the
lamentable
image
in
advancing
and
whitened
the
moving
mourning
of
the
waters
with
its
peaceful
reflection
and
durtal
thought
of
the
absolution
which
he
would
perhaps
obtain
and
he
reopened
his
and
numbered
his
faults
and
slowly
as
on
the
day
before
he
tapped
in
his
innermost
being
a
fountain
of
tears
i
must
control
myself
he
said
trembling
at
the
idea
that
he
would
suffocate
again
and
be
unable
to
speak
and
he
resolved
to
begin
his
confession
at
the
other
end
first
going
over
the
minor
sins
keeping
the
great
ones
for
the
end
so
as
to
finish
with
the
avowal
of
his
carnal
misdeeds
if
i
succumb
then
i
can
explain
myself
in
two
words
my
god
may
the
prior
only
not
remain
silent
as
he
did
yesterday
may
he
only
absolve
me
he
shook
off
his
sadness
left
the
pond
and
returning
to
the
lime
avenue
he
interested
himself
in
a
closer
inspection
of
the
trees
they
raised
huge
trunks
covered
with
stonecrop
silvered
grey
by
mosses
and
several
that
morning
were
wrapped
as
in
a
mantle
trimmed
with
pearls
gossamer
threads
studded
with
drops
of
dew
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
but
fearing
a
shower
for
it
looked
threatening
he
retired
to
his
cell
he
felt
no
desire
to
read
he
was
eager
for
while
yet
he
dreaded
the
arrival
of
nine
to
have
done
with
to
get
rid
of
the
weight
upon
his
soul
and
he
prayed
mechanically
without
knowing
what
he
mumbled
always
thinking
on
this
confession
full
of
alarm
and
harassed
with
fears
he
went
down
a
little
before
the
time
and
when
he
entered
the
auditorium
his
heart
failed
him
in
spite
of
himself
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
where
he
had
suffered
so
cruelly
to
think
that
he
had
to
put
himself
on
that
hurdle
again
to
stretch
himself
on
that
rack
of
torture
he
tried
to
collect
himself
to
compose
himself
and
he
drew
himself
up
quickly
he
heard
the
footsteps
of
the
monk
the
door
opened
and
for
the
first
time
durtal
dared
to
look
the
prior
in
the
face
it
seemed
to
be
hardly
the
same
man
nor
the
face
he
had
noticed
from
a
distance
the
profile
was
so
haughty
and
the
full
face
so
sweet
the
eye
dulled
the
proud
energy
of
the
features
an
eye
familiar
and
deep
when
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
quiet
joy
and
a
sad
pity
come
he
said
do
not
be
disturbed
you
are
about
to
speak
to
our
saviour
alone
who
knows
all
your
faults
and
he
knelt
down
and
prayed
for
some
time
and
came
as
on
the
day
before
to
sit
by
the
he
bent
towards
durtal
and
listened
somewhat
reassured
the
penitent
began
without
too
great
anguish
he
accused
himself
of
faults
common
to
all
men
want
of
charity
towards
his
neighbour
evil
speaking
hate
rash
judgment
abuse
lies
vanity
anger
etc
the
monk
interrupted
him
for
a
moment
you
said
just
now
i
think
that
in
your
youth
you
contracted
debts
have
you
paid
them
and
on
an
affirmative
sign
from
durtal
he
said
good
and
went
on
have
you
belonged
to
any
secret
society
have
you
fought
a
duel
i
am
obliged
to
ask
these
questions
for
they
are
reserved
cases
no
good
and
he
was
silent
before
god
i
accuse
myself
of
everything
resumed
durtal
as
i
confessed
to
you
yesterday
since
my
first
communion
i
have
given
up
everything
prayers
mass
everything
i
have
denied
god
i
have
blasphemed
i
had
entirely
lost
faith
and
durtal
stopped
he
was
reaching
the
sins
of
the
flesh
his
voice
fell
here
i
do
not
know
how
to
explain
myself
he
said
keeping
back
his
tears
let
us
see
the
monk
said
gently
you
told
me
yesterday
that
you
had
committed
all
those
acts
which
are
comprised
in
the
sin
of
lust
yes
father
and
trembling
he
added
must
i
go
into
the
details
no
it
is
useless
i
will
confine
myself
to
asking
you
for
it
alters
the
nature
of
the
sin
whether
in
your
case
there
have
been
any
private
sins
or
any
sins
committed
between
persons
of
the
same
sex
not
since
i
left
school
have
you
committed
adultery
yes
am
i
to
understand
that
in
your
relations
with
women
you
have
committed
every
possible
excess
durtal
made
an
affirmative
sign
that
is
sufficient
and
the
monk
was
silent
durtal
choked
with
disgust
the
avowal
of
these
horrors
was
a
terrible
effort
to
him
yet
crushed
as
he
was
by
shame
he
was
beginning
to
breathe
when
suddenly
he
plunged
his
head
again
in
his
hands
the
remembrance
of
the
sacrilege
in
which
madame
chantelouve
had
made
him
share
came
back
to
him
hesitatingly
he
confessed
that
he
had
from
curiosity
assisted
at
a
black
mass
and
that
afterwards
without
wishing
it
he
had
defiled
a
host
which
that
woman
saturated
with
satanism
concealed
about
her
the
prior
listened
without
moving
did
you
continue
your
visits
to
that
woman
no
that
had
given
me
a
horror
of
her
the
trappist
reflected
and
said
that
is
all
i
think
i
have
confessed
everything
replied
durtal
the
confessor
was
silent
for
some
minutes
and
then
in
a
pensive
voice
he
murmured
i
am
struck
even
more
than
yesterday
by
the
astonishing
miracle
which
heaven
has
worked
in
you
you
were
sick
so
sick
that
what
martha
said
of
the
body
of
lazarus
might
truly
have
been
said
of
your
soul
foetet
and
christ
has
in
some
manner
raised
you
only
do
not
deceive
yourself
the
conversion
of
a
sinner
is
not
his
cure
but
only
his
convalescence
and
this
convalescence
sometimes
lasts
for
several
years
and
is
often
long
it
is
expedient
that
you
should
determine
from
this
moment
to
fortify
yourself
against
any
falling
back
and
to
do
all
in
your
power
for
recovery
the
preventive
treatment
consists
of
prayer
the
sacrament
of
penance
and
holy
communion
prayer
you
know
it
for
without
much
prayer
you
could
not
have
decided
to
come
here
after
the
troubled
life
you
had
led
ah
but
i
prayed
so
badly
it
does
not
matter
as
your
wish
was
to
pray
well
confession
it
was
painful
to
you
it
will
be
less
so
now
that
you
no
longer
have
to
avow
the
accumulated
sins
of
years
the
communion
troubles
me
more
for
it
is
to
be
feared
that
when
you
have
triumphed
over
the
flesh
the
demon
should
await
you
there
and
endeavour
to
draw
you
away
for
he
knows
well
that
without
this
divine
government
no
healing
is
possible
you
will
therefore
have
to
give
this
matter
all
your
attention
the
monk
reflected
a
minute
and
then
went
on
the
holy
eucharist
you
will
have
more
need
of
it
than
others
for
you
will
be
more
unhappy
than
less
cultured
and
simpler
beings
you
will
be
tortured
by
the
imagination
it
has
made
you
sin
much
and
by
a
just
recompense
it
will
make
you
suffer
much
it
will
be
the
badly
closed
door
of
your
soul
by
which
the
demon
will
enter
and
spread
himself
in
you
watch
over
this
and
pray
fervently
that
the
saviour
may
help
you
tell
me
have
you
a
rosary
no
father
i
feel
said
the
monk
that
the
tone
in
which
you
said
shows
a
certain
hostility
to
the
rosary
i
admit
that
this
mechanical
manner
of
saying
prayers
wearies
me
a
little
i
do
not
know
why
but
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
end
of
some
seconds
i
can
no
longer
think
of
what
i
am
saying
i
should
mock
and
should
certainly
end
by
stammering
out
something
stupid
you
have
known
quietly
answered
the
prior
some
fathers
of
families
their
children
stammer
forth
caresses
and
tell
them
no
matter
what
and
yet
they
are
delighted
to
listen
why
should
not
our
lord
who
is
a
good
father
love
to
hear
his
children
when
they
drawl
or
even
when
they
talk
nonsense
and
after
a
pause
he
went
on
i
scent
the
devil
artifice
in
what
you
say
for
the
highest
graces
are
attached
to
this
crown
of
prayers
the
most
blessed
virgin
herself
revealed
to
the
saints
this
means
of
prayer
she
declared
she
delighted
in
it
that
should
be
enough
to
make
us
love
it
do
it
then
for
her
who
has
powerfully
assisted
in
your
conversion
who
has
interceded
with
her
son
to
save
you
remember
also
that
god
wished
that
all
graces
should
come
to
us
through
her
bernard
expressly
declares
nos
habere
voluit
per
mariam
the
monk
paused
anew
and
added
however
the
rosary
enrages
fools
and
that
is
a
sure
sign
you
will
for
a
penance
recite
ten
every
day
for
a
month
he
ceased
and
then
went
on
again
slowly
all
of
us
alas
retain
that
scar
of
original
sin
which
is
the
inclination
towards
evil
each
man
encourages
it
more
or
less
as
for
you
since
you
grew
up
the
scar
has
been
always
open
but
as
you
hate
the
wound
god
will
close
it
so
i
will
say
nothing
of
your
past
as
your
repentance
and
your
firm
resolve
to
sin
no
more
efface
it
you
will
receive
the
pledge
of
reconciliation
you
will
communicate
after
so
many
years
the
lord
will
set
out
on
the
way
to
your
soul
and
will
rest
there
approach
him
with
great
humility
and
prepare
yourself
from
this
moment
by
prayer
for
this
mysterious
meeting
of
hearts
which
his
goodness
desires
now
say
your
act
of
contrition
and
i
will
give
you
holy
absolution
the
monk
raised
his
arms
and
the
sleeves
of
his
white
cowl
rose
above
him
like
two
wings
with
uplifted
eyes
he
uttered
the
imperious
formula
which
breaks
the
bonds
and
the
three
words
ego
te
absolvo
spoken
more
distinctly
and
slowly
fell
upon
durtal
who
trembled
from
head
to
foot
he
almost
sank
to
the
ground
incapable
of
collecting
himself
or
understanding
himself
only
feeling
in
the
clearest
manner
that
christ
himself
was
present
near
him
in
that
place
and
finding
no
word
of
thanks
he
wept
ravished
and
bowed
down
under
the
great
sign
of
the
cross
with
which
the
monk
enveloped
him
he
seemed
to
be
waking
from
a
dream
as
the
prior
said
to
him
rejoice
your
life
is
dead
it
is
buried
in
a
cloister
and
in
a
cloister
it
will
be
born
again
it
is
a
good
omen
have
confidence
in
our
lord
and
go
in
peace
and
the
father
added
pressing
his
hand
do
not
be
afraid
of
disturbing
me
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
not
only
for
confession
but
for
interviews
and
for
any
advice
which
may
be
of
use
to
you
you
quite
understand
me
they
left
the
auditorium
together
the
monk
bowed
to
him
in
the
corridor
and
disappeared
durtal
hesitated
whether
to
meditate
in
his
cell
or
in
the
church
when
bruno
met
him
approaching
durtal
he
said
well
that
is
a
fine
weight
the
less
on
your
stomach
and
as
durtal
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
he
laughed
do
you
think
that
an
old
sinner
like
me
could
not
tell
from
a
thousand
nothings
if
only
from
the
way
your
poor
eyes
are
now
shining
that
you
had
not
been
reconciled
when
you
landed
here
now
i
have
just
met
the
reverend
father
returning
to
the
cloister
and
i
find
you
coming
out
of
the
auditorium
there
is
no
need
to
be
particularly
sly
to
guess
that
the
great
wash
has
just
taken
place
but
said
durtal
you
could
not
have
seen
the
prior
with
me
for
he
had
left
before
you
came
in
and
he
might
have
been
performing
some
other
duty
no
for
he
was
not
in
his
scapular
he
had
his
cowl
on
and
as
he
never
puts
on
that
robe
except
to
go
to
church
or
at
confessions
i
was
quite
certain
that
he
came
from
the
auditorium
as
there
is
no
office
at
this
hour
i
may
also
point
out
that
as
the
trappists
do
not
come
to
confession
in
this
room
two
persons
only
could
have
been
with
him
you
or
i
you
may
say
as
much
replied
durtal
laughing
father
etienne
met
them
in
the
midst
of
all
this
and
durtal
asked
him
for
a
rosary
but
i
have
not
one
exclaimed
the
monk
i
have
several
said
bruno
and
shall
be
most
happy
to
offer
you
one
you
will
allow
me
father
the
monk
acquiesced
by
a
sign
then
if
you
will
come
with
me
replied
the
oblate
addressing
durtal
i
will
hand
it
you
without
delay
they
went
upstairs
together
and
durtal
then
learnt
that
bruno
lived
in
a
room
at
the
bottom
of
a
small
corridor
not
far
from
his
own
his
cell
was
very
simply
furnished
with
old
furniture
a
bed
a
mahogany
bureau
a
large
full
of
ascetic
books
an
earthenware
stove
and
some
these
articles
were
evidently
the
property
of
the
oblate
for
they
were
nothing
like
the
furniture
of
la
trappe
pray
be
seated
said
bruno
indicating
an
and
they
conversed
having
first
discussed
the
sacrament
of
penance
the
talk
came
round
to
the
subject
of
father
maximin
and
durtal
admitted
the
high
bearing
of
the
prior
had
terrified
him
at
first
bruno
laughed
yes
he
said
he
produces
that
effect
on
those
who
never
come
near
him
but
when
one
associates
with
him
one
finds
that
he
is
only
strict
for
himself
for
no
one
is
more
indulgent
to
others
in
every
acceptation
of
the
term
he
is
a
true
and
holy
monk
besides
he
has
great
judgment
and
as
durtal
spoke
to
him
of
the
other
cenobites
and
wondered
that
there
were
some
quite
young
men
among
them
bruno
replied
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
most
trappists
have
lived
in
the
world
the
idea
so
widespread
that
people
take
refuge
in
la
trappe
after
long
sorrows
or
disorderly
lives
is
absolutely
false
besides
to
be
able
to
stand
the
weakening
rule
of
the
cloister
it
is
necessary
to
begin
young
and
not
to
come
in
worn
out
with
every
kind
of
abuse
it
is
also
necessary
to
avoid
confounding
misanthropy
with
the
monastic
vocation
it
is
not
hypochondria
but
the
divine
call
which
leads
to
la
trappe
there
is
a
special
grace
which
makes
all
young
men
who
have
never
lived
in
the
world
long
to
bury
themselves
in
silence
and
therein
suffer
the
hardest
privations
and
they
are
happy
as
i
hope
you
will
be
and
yet
their
life
is
still
more
rigorous
than
you
would
think
take
the
lay
brothers
for
example
think
of
their
giving
themselves
up
to
the
most
painful
labour
and
that
they
have
not
like
the
fathers
the
consolation
of
singing
and
assisting
at
all
the
offices
remember
that
even
their
reward
the
communion
is
not
very
often
conceded
to
them
now
think
of
the
winter
here
the
cold
is
frightful
in
these
decayed
buildings
nothing
shuts
properly
and
the
wind
sweeps
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
they
freeze
without
fires
they
sleep
upon
pallets
and
they
can
not
help
or
encourage
each
other
for
they
hardly
know
each
other
as
all
conversation
is
forbidden
think
also
that
these
poor
people
never
hear
a
kindly
word
a
word
which
would
soothe
and
comfort
them
they
work
from
dawn
till
night
and
the
master
never
thanks
them
for
their
zeal
never
tells
the
good
workman
that
he
is
pleased
consider
also
that
in
summer
when
men
are
hired
from
the
neighbouring
villages
to
reap
the
harvest
these
rest
when
the
sun
scorches
the
fields
they
sit
in
their
shirt
sleeves
under
the
shade
of
the
ricks
and
drink
if
they
are
thirsty
and
eat
and
the
lay
brother
in
his
heavy
clothes
looks
at
them
and
goes
on
with
his
work
and
neither
eats
nor
drinks
ah
men
must
have
souls
to
stand
such
a
life
but
surely
there
must
be
some
off
days
said
durtal
when
the
rule
is
relaxed
never
there
is
not
even
as
in
some
very
strict
orders
the
carmelites
to
take
one
instance
an
hour
of
recreation
when
the
religious
may
talk
and
laugh
here
the
silence
is
eternal
even
when
they
are
together
in
the
refectory
then
they
read
the
conferences
of
cassien
the
ladder
of
climacus
the
lives
of
the
fathers
of
the
desert
or
some
other
pious
book
and
on
sunday
on
sunday
they
rise
an
hour
earlier
but
on
the
whole
it
is
their
best
day
for
they
can
follow
all
the
offices
and
pass
their
whole
time
in
church
humility
and
carried
to
such
an
extent
are
superhuman
cried
durtal
but
they
are
surely
given
a
sufficient
quantity
of
strong
nourishment
to
enable
them
to
give
themselves
up
from
morning
till
evening
to
exhausting
work
in
the
fields
bruno
smiled
they
simply
get
vegetables
which
are
not
even
as
good
as
those
which
are
served
to
us
and
by
way
of
wine
they
quench
their
thirst
with
a
sour
and
insipid
liquid
which
leaves
half
a
glass
full
of
sediment
they
get
a
pint
each
and
if
they
are
thirsty
they
can
add
water
and
how
often
do
they
eat
that
depends
from
the
september
to
lent
they
only
eat
once
a
day
at
two
and
during
lent
this
meal
is
put
off
till
four
from
easter
to
the
september
when
the
cistercian
fast
is
less
strict
dinner
is
at
about
eleven
and
to
this
may
be
added
a
light
meal
in
the
evening
it
is
frightful
to
work
for
months
on
one
meal
a
day
two
hours
after
noon
after
being
up
since
two
in
the
morning
having
had
no
dinner
the
evening
before
it
is
sometimes
necessary
to
relax
the
rule
a
little
and
when
a
monk
fails
from
weakness
he
is
not
refused
a
morsel
of
bread
it
would
be
well
continued
bruno
pensively
to
relax
still
further
the
grasp
of
these
observances
for
this
question
of
food
is
becoming
a
veritable
in
recruiting
for
la
trappe
souls
which
delight
in
these
cloisters
are
forced
to
fly
them
because
their
bodies
can
not
stand
the
rule
the
opinion
of
bruno
has
been
lately
adopted
by
all
the
abbeys
of
the
order
in
a
general
chapter
of
la
trappe
held
from
the
to
the
september
in
holland
at
tilburg
it
was
decided
that
except
in
seasons
of
fasting
the
monks
might
eat
a
little
in
the
morning
dine
at
eleven
and
sup
in
the
evening

of
the
new
constitutions

by
this
assembly
of

and
the
fathers
lead
the
same
life
as
the
lay
brothers
absolutely
they
set
the
example
they
all
swallow
the
same
pittance
and
sleep
in
the
same
dormitory
on
similar
beds
there
is
complete
equality
only
the
fathers
have
the
advantage
of
singing
the
office
and
obtaining
more
frequent
communions
among
the
lay
brothers
there
are
two
who
have
interested
me
particularly
one
quite
young
a
tall
fair
man
with
a
pointed
beard
the
other
a
very
old
man
quite
bent
the
young
one
is
brother
anacletus
this
young
man
is
a
veritable
column
of
prayer
and
one
of
the
most
precious
recruits
whom
heaven
has
bestowed
upon
our
abbey
as
for
old
simeon
he
is
a
child
of
la
trappe
for
he
was
brought
up
in
an
orphanage
of
the
order
there
you
have
an
extraordinary
soul
a
true
saint
who
already
lives
absorbed
in
god
we
will
talk
of
him
at
greater
length
another
day
for
it
is
time
we
went
down
the
hour
of
sext
is
near
wait
here
is
the
rosary
which
i
am
pleased
to
offer
you
allow
me
to
add
to
it
a
medal
of
saint
benedict
and
he
made
over
to
durtal
a
small
wooden
rosary
and
the
strange
circle
engraved
with
cabalistic
letters
the
amulet
of
saint
benedict
do
you
know
the
meaning
of
these
signs
yes
i
read
it
once
in
a
pamphlet
of
dom
guéranger
good
and
when
do
you
communicate
it
is
impossible
why
impossible
because
there
will
be
only
a
single
mass
that
of
five
and
at
that
the
rule
prevents
your
communicating
alone
father
benedict
who
usually
says
an
earlier
mass
went
away
this
morning
and
will
not
return
for
two
days
there
is
some
mistake
but
the
prior
positively
declared
to
me
that
i
should
communicate
exclaimed
durtal
not
all
the
fathers
here
then
are
priests
no
in
fact
as
to
priests
there
is
the
abbot
who
is
ill
the
prior
who
will
offer
the
sacrifice
at
five
father
benedict
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
and
another
whom
you
have
not
seen
and
who
is
travelling
and
then
if
it
had
been
possible
i
also
should
have
approached
the
holy
table
then
if
the
fathers
are
not
all
ordained
what
difference
is
there
between
those
who
have
obtained
the
priesthood
and
the
simple
lay
brothers
education
to
be
a
father
a
man
must
have
studied
must
know
latin
and
in
a
word
must
not
be
what
the
lay
brothers
are
peasants
or
workmen
in
any
case
i
shall
see
the
prior
and
as
to
the
communion
i
will
let
you
know
after
the
office
but
it
is
tiresome
it
is
a
pity
you
could
not
have
come
up
this
morning
with
us
durtal
made
a
gesture
of
regret
he
went
into
the
chapel
dwelling
on
this
misfortune
and
praying
god
not
to
delay
his
into
grace
any
longer
after
sext
the
oblate
came
to
rejoin
him
it
is
just
as
i
thought
he
said
but
nevertheless
you
will
be
admitted
to
take
the
sacrament
the
father
prior
has
arranged
with
the
curate
who
dines
with
us
he
will
say
a
mass
morning
before
leaving
and
you
will
then
communicate
oh
groaned
durtal
this
news
broke
his
heart
that
he
should
have
come
to
la
trappe
to
receive
the
eucharist
from
the
hands
of
a
priest
of
passage
from
a
jovial
priest
such
as
this
man
ah
no
i
have
confessed
to
a
monk
and
i
wished
to
receive
the
communion
from
a
monk
he
exclaimed
it
would
have
been
better
to
wait
till
father
benedict
returned
but
what
can
i
do
i
can
hardly
explain
to
the
prior
how
repugnant
this
unknown
priest
is
to
me
and
how
terribly
painful
it
would
be
to
me
after
having
gone
through
so
much
to
end
by
being
thus
reconciled
in
a
cloister
and
he
complained
to
god
telling
him
that
all
the
joy
he
might
have
felt
in
being
purified
and
clean
at
last
was
now
spoilt
by
this
disappointment
he
arrived
at
the
refectory
hanging
his
head
the
curate
was
there
already
seeing
durtal
sad
demeanour
he
charitably
tried
to
cheer
him
but
the
jokes
he
attempted
produced
the
opposite
effect
durtal
smiled
in
order
to
be
polite
but
his
air
was
so
wearied
that
bruno
who
saw
it
turned
the
conversation
and
monopolized
the
priest
durtal
was
in
a
hurry
for
his
dinner
to
be
over
he
had
eaten
his
egg
and
was
painfully
swallowing
a
warm
potato
soup
made
with
hot
oil
which
from
its
appearance
might
have
been
mistaken
for
vaseline
but
he
now
cared
little
about
his
food
he
said
to
himself
it
is
dreadful
to
carry
away
an
irritating
and
painful
recollection
of
a
first
communion
and
i
know
it
will
haunt
me
for
ever
i
know
well
enough
that
from
a
theological
point
of
view
it
does
not
matter
whether
i
am
dealing
with
a
priest
or
a
trappist
both
are
but
interpreters
between
god
and
me
but
yet
i
feel
very
well
that
it
is
not
at
all
the
same
thing
for
once
at
least
i
need
a
guarantee
of
certain
holiness
and
how
can
i
have
it
with
an
ecclesiastic
who
hawks
about
jokes
like
a
bagman
he
stopped
remembering
that
the
abbé
gévresin
fearing
this
mistrust
had
specially
sent
him
to
a
trappist
monastery
what
a
run
of
he
said
to
himself
he
did
not
even
hear
the
conversation
which
was
going
on
beside
him
between
the
curate
and
the
oblate
he
struggled
with
himself
all
alone
as
he
chewed
with
his
nose
in
his
plate
i
do
not
wish
to
communicate
he
went
on
and
he
was
shocked
he
was
cowardly
and
becoming
foolish
at
the
last
would
not
the
saviour
give
himself
to
him
all
the
same
he
rose
from
the
table
stirred
by
a
dull
anguish
and
he
wandered
in
the
park
and
went
down
the
paths
as
chance
led
him
another
idea
was
now
growing
in
him
an
idea
that
heaven
was
inflicting
a
trial
upon
him
i
want
humility
he
repeated
well
it
is
to
punish
me
that
i
am
refused
the
joy
of
being
sanctified
by
a
monk
christ
has
forgiven
me
that
is
much
why
should
he
do
more
by
taking
note
of
my
preferences
and
granting
my
wishes
this
thought
appeased
him
for
a
few
minutes
and
reproaching
himself
for
rebelling
he
accused
himself
of
being
unjust
towards
a
priest
who
after
all
might
be
a
saint
ah
enough
of
that
he
said
i
must
accept
the
fact
and
try
for
once
to
be
a
little
humble
but
i
have
to
recite
my
rosary
he
seated
himself
on
the
grass
and
began
he
had
not
reached
the
second
bead
when
misunderstanding
again
pursued
him
he
began
again
on
the
pater
and
ave
and
went
on
thinking
no
more
of
the
sense
of
his
prayers
reflecting
what
that
the
one
monk
who
says
mass
every
day
should
be
away
so
that
i
have
to
go
through
such
a
disappointment
he
was
silent
and
had
a
moment
of
calm
when
suddenly
a
new
element
of
trouble
burst
upon
him
he
looked
at
the
rosary
of
which
he
had
told
ten
beads
let
me
see
the
prior
told
me
to
recite
ten
every
day
ten
beads
or
ten
rosaries
beads
he
said
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
answered
rosaries
he
remained
perplexed
but
that
is
idiotic
he
could
not
have
told
me
to
go
through
the
rosary
ten
times
a
day
that
would
amount
to
something
like
five
hundred
prayers
on
end
no
one
could
do
such
a
task
without
losing
his
wits
there
is
no
doubt
it
is
clear
he
meant
ten
beads
but
no
for
if
a
confessor
gives
a
penance
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
would
proportion
it
to
the
greatness
of
the
sins
and
as
i
have
such
repugnance
for
these
drops
of
devotion
taken
in
globules
it
is
natural
that
he
should
gorge
me
with
a
large
dose
of
the
rosary
still
still
it
can
not
be
i
should
not
have
even
time
for
it
all
in
paris
it
is
absurd
and
the
idea
that
he
was
deceiving
himself
came
intermittently
charging
back
still
there
must
be
no
haggling
in
ecclesiastical
language
means
ten
beads
no
doubt
but
i
remember
very
well
that
after
he
pronounced
the
word
rosary
the
father
expressed
himself
thus
will
say
ten
that
means
ten
rosaries
for
otherwise
he
would
have
specified
ten
of
a
rosary
and
so
he
thrust
and
parried
with
himself
the
father
had
no
need
to
put
the
dots
on
all
the
i
if
he
were
using
an
ordinary
phrase
known
to
everyone
this
cavilling
about
the
value
of
a
word
is
ridiculous
he
tried
to
get
rid
of
this
torment
by
appealing
to
his
reason
and
suddenly
there
came
out
some
argument
which
unsettled
him
he
found
out
that
it
was
through
cowardice
idleness
desire
for
contradiction
and
the
necessity
of
rebelling
that
he
did
not
wish
to
wind
his
ten
reels
of
the
two
interpretations
i
have
chosen
the
one
which
would
relieve
me
of
all
effort
and
trouble
it
is
really
too
easy
that
alone
proves
that
i
deceive
myself
when
i
try
to
persuade
myself
that
the
prior
only
ordered
me
to
pick
out
ten
beads
then
a
pater
ten
aves
and
a
gloria
are
nothing
it
is
not
heavy
as
a
penance
and
then
he
answered
himself
but
it
is
much
for
you
for
you
can
not
even
attempt
so
much
without
wandering
he
was
turning
on
himself
without
advancing
a
step
i
have
never
felt
such
hesitation
he
said
trying
to
pull
himself
together
i
am
not
stupid
and
yet
i
am
fighting
against
my
good
sense
for
it
is
not
a
matter
of
doubt
i
know
it
i
ought
to
say
ten
aves
and
not
one
more
he
remained
nonplussed
almost
frightened
at
his
condition
which
was
new
to
him
and
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
to
silence
himself
he
thought
of
a
new
idea
to
conciliate
both
parties
which
seemed
most
concise
and
which
presented
at
least
a
provisional
solution
in
any
case
he
reflected
i
can
not
communicate
if
i
do
not
complete
my
penance
in
the
doubt
the
wisest
course
is
to
yoke
myself
to
the
ten
rosaries
later
i
shall
see
if
necessary
i
shall
be
able
to
consult
the
prior
it
is
true
that
he
will
think
me
an
idiot
if
i
speak
to
him
of
these
rosaries
so
i
shall
not
be
able
to
ask
him
that
but
then
you
see
you
admit
yourself
it
can
only
be
ten
beads
he
was
furious
with
himself
and
for
silence
sake
rushed
upon
the
rosary
he
might
well
shut
his
eyes
and
try
to
collect
himself
it
was
impossible
for
him
at
the
end
of
the
second
ten
to
follow
his
prayers
he
hesitated
forgetting
the
large
beads
of
the
paters
losing
his
way
in
the
small
beads
of
the
aves
stamping
on
the
ground
to
check
himself
he
thought
of
transporting
himself
in
imagination
at
each
dose
into
one
of
the
chapels
of
the
virgin
which
he
loved
to
attend
in
paris
at
notre
dame
des
victoires
at
sulpice
at
severin
but
these
virgins
were
not
numerous
enough
for
him
to
dedicate
each
set
of
ten
to
them
so
he
evoked
the
madonnas
of
the
early
masters
and
absorbed
before
their
images
he
turned
the
windlass
of
his
prayers
not
understanding
what
he
mumbled
but
praying
the
mother
of
the
saviour
to
accept
his
paternosters
as
she
would
receive
the
lost
smoke
of
a
censer
forgotten
before
the
altar
i
can
not
force
myself
any
more
he
said
he
left
this
toil
worried
and
crushed
and
wanting
to
take
breath
there
were
still
three
rosaries
to
exhaust
and
as
soon
as
he
had
stopped
the
question
of
the
eucharist
which
had
been
dropped
came
up
again
better
not
to
communicate
than
to
communicate
badly
and
it
was
impossible
that
after
such
debates
and
with
such
prejudices
he
could
properly
approach
the
holy
table
yes
but
then
what
shall
i
do
in
reality
was
it
not
monstrous
of
me
to
dispute
the
monk
orders
to
wish
to
carry
them
out
in
my
own
way
to
take
them
up
at
my
convenience
if
this
goes
on
i
shall
sin
so
much
that
i
shall
have
to
confess
again
he
said
to
break
through
this
feeling
he
threw
himself
again
upon
his
wheel
but
then
stupefied
himself
completely
the
device
he
had
tried
to
keep
himself
before
the
virgin
at
least
was
used
up
when
he
wished
to
abstract
himself
and
to
bring
up
a
recollection
of
memling
he
could
not
succeed
and
his
wearying
him
distressed
him
my
soul
is
worn
out
he
thought
i
should
do
well
to
let
it
rest
while
i
stay
quiet
he
wandered
round
the
pond
not
knowing
what
to
do
next
suppose
i
go
to
my
cell
he
went
there
tried
to
become
absorbed
in
the
little
office
of
the
virgin
and
did
not
grasp
a
single
word
of
the
phrases
he
was
reading
he
went
down
and
began
to
prowl
about
the
park
again
this
is
enough
to
drive
me
mad
he
cried
and
mournfully
he
exclaimed
i
ought
to
be
happy
to
pray
in
peace
and
prepare
myself
for
act
yet
never
have
i
been
so
restless
so
upset
so
far
from
god
but
i
must
finish
this
penance
despair
seized
him
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
letting
all
go
he
mortified
himself
again
and
compelled
himself
to
tell
the
beads
he
finished
by
despatching
them
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
powers
and
he
immediately
found
a
new
means
of
torture
he
reproached
himself
with
having
moaned
the
prayers
negligently
without
having
even
seriously
tried
to
follow
their
meaning
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
beginning
the
rosary
over
again
but
in
the
face
of
the
evident
folly
of
this
suggestion
he
pulled
himself
up
refused
to
listen
and
then
he
worried
himself
again
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
you
have
not
literally
fulfilled
the
task
assigned
you
by
the
confessor
for
your
conscience
reproaches
you
for
your
want
of
reflection
and
your
wandering
but
i
am
half
dead
he
exclaimed
i
can
not
go
through
the
exercises
again
in
this
condition
and
once
again
he
ended
by
giving
a
casting
vote
and
finding
a
new
weakness
by
saying
over
another
ten
thoughtfully
pronouncing
the
prayers
with
care
he
might
make
up
for
all
the
beads
of
the
rosary
which
he
had
mumbled
without
understanding
them
and
he
tried
to
turn
the
crank
but
as
soon
as
he
had
got
out
the
pater
he
wandered
he
was
obstinate
in
wishing
to
grind
out
the
aves
but
then
his
mind
gave
way
and
became
thoroughly
distracted
he
stopped
thinking
what
is
the
use
of
it
besides
would
one
set
of
ten
however
well
said
be
equal
to
five
hundred
prayers
that
have
missed
fire
and
then
why
one
set
of
ten
and
not
two
why
not
three
it
is
absurd
he
grew
angry
after
all
he
concluded
these
repetitions
are
absurd
christ
positively
declared
that
we
should
not
use
vain
repetitions
in
our
prayers
then
what
is
the
object
of
this
wheel
of
aves
if
i
dwell
upon
such
ideas
if
i
cavil
at
the
injunctions
of
the
monk
i
am
lost
said
he
suddenly
and
by
an
effort
of
will
he
stifled
the
revolt
which
was
rumbling
in
him
he
took
refuge
in
his
cell
the
hours
lengthened
interminably
he
killed
the
time
by
recapitulating
all
the
same
objections
with
all
the
same
answers
it
was
a
repetition
of
which
he
was
himself
ashamed
so
much
is
certain
that
i
am
the
victim
of
an
aberration
he
said
i
do
not
speak
of
the
eucharist
there
my
thoughts
may
not
be
exact
but
at
least
they
are
not
maddening
while
as
for
this
question
of
paternosters
he
confused
himself
so
much
that
he
felt
hammered
like
an
anvil
between
these
two
opposing
ideas
and
finally
sank
drowsily
on
a
chair
thus
he
passed
the
time
till
the
hour
of
vespers
and
supper
after
this
meal
he
returned
to
the
park
and
then
the
slumbering
dispute
revived
and
all
came
back
a
furious
battle
was
raging
within
him
he
remained
there
immovable
astounded
listening
to
himself
when
a
rapid
footstep
approached
and
bruno
said
to
him
take
care
you
are
possessed
by
the
devil
and
as
durtal
stupefied
did
not
answer
yes
he
said
god
sometimes
allows
me
intuitions
and
i
am
certain
at
this
moment
that
the
devil
is
working
in
you
let
us
see
what
is
wrong
with
you
i
i
do
not
know
myself
and
durtal
told
him
of
the
extraordinary
conflict
about
the
rosary
which
had
been
raging
in
him
since
the
morning
but
this
is
madness
exclaimed
the
oblate
it
is
ten
beads
the
prior
ordered
you
to
tell
ten
rosaries
would
be
impossible
i
know
it
and
yet
i
doubt
still
always
the
same
tactics
said
bruno
contriving
to
render
disgusting
the
thing
you
ought
to
do
yes
the
devil
wished
to
make
the
rosary
odious
to
you
by
crushing
you
with
it
and
what
is
there
besides
you
do
not
wish
to
communicate
true
replied
durtal
i
thought
as
much
when
i
was
watching
you
at
supper
ah
well
after
conversions
the
evil
one
is
at
work
and
it
is
nothing
believe
me
he
was
harder
on
me
than
that
he
slipped
his
arm
under
durtal
and
leading
him
to
the
auditorium
begged
him
to
wait
and
disappeared
some
minutes
afterwards
the
prior
entered
well
said
he
bruno
tells
me
that
you
are
suffering
what
is
it
exactly
it
is
so
stupid
that
i
am
ashamed
to
explain
myself
you
will
never
astonish
a
monk
said
the
prior
smiling
well
i
know
precisely
i
am
certain
that
you
gave
me
ten
beads
of
the
rosary
to
recite
every
day
for
a
month
and
since
this
morning
i
have
been
arguing
with
myself
against
all
common
sense
to
convince
myself
that
my
daily
penance
is
to
be
the
rosary
ten
times
hand
me
your
rosary
said
the
monk
and
look
at
these
ten
beads
well
that
is
all
i
prescribed
for
you
and
all
you
have
to
recite
so
you
have
told
all
the
beads
ten
times
durtal
signified
assent
and
naturally
you
were
perplexed
you
lost
all
patience
and
ended
up
by
rambling
and
seeing
durtal
pitiful
smile
well
listen
to
me
declared
the
father
in
an
energetic
tone
i
absolutely
forbid
you
for
the
future
to
begin
a
prayer
again
it
has
been
badly
said
so
much
the
worse
go
on
do
not
repeat
it
i
need
not
ask
you
if
the
idea
of
abstaining
from
communion
occurred
to
you
for
that
comes
of
itself
it
is
there
that
the
enemy
directs
all
his
efforts
do
not
listen
to
the
devil
voice
which
would
keep
you
away
whatever
happens
you
will
communicate
you
should
have
no
scruple
for
i
command
you
to
receive
the
sacrament
i
take
it
all
upon
myself
and
now
another
question
what
sort
of
nights
have
you
durtal
told
him
of
the
awful
night
of
his
arrival
at
la
trappe
and
of
the
feeling
of
being
spied
upon
which
had
awakened
him
the
day
before
we
have
long
known
these
manifestations
they
are
without
imminent
danger
do
not
therefore
let
them
trouble
you
at
the
same
time
if
they
continue
you
will
let
me
know
and
we
will
not
neglect
attending
to
them
and
the
trappist
left
quietly
while
durtal
remained
thinking
i
never
doubted
that
those
phenomena
were
satanic
he
thought
but
i
did
not
understand
these
attacks
upon
the
soul
this
charge
at
full
speed
against
my
reason
which
remains
untouched
and
yet
is
overcome
that
is
remarkable
if
only
this
lesson
may
be
useful
to
me
so
that
i
may
not
be
unhorsed
on
the
first
alarm
he
went
up
to
his
cell
again
and
a
great
peace
fell
upon
him
all
had
died
down
at
the
voice
of
the
monk
he
now
only
felt
surprise
at
having
been
off
the
rails
for
hours
he
understood
now
that
he
had
been
assailed
unawares
and
that
the
struggle
had
not
been
with
himself
he
said
his
prayers
and
lay
down
and
suddenly
the
assault
began
again
by
new
tactics
he
had
not
guessed
at
no
doubt
i
shall
communicate
he
said
to
himself
but
but
am
i
prepared
for
such
an
act
i
ought
to
have
collected
my
thoughts
in
the
i
ought
to
have
thanked
the
lord
for
having
absolved
me
and
i
have
lost
my
time
in
nonsense
why
did
i
not
say
that
just
now
to
father
maximin
how
is
it
i
did
not
think
of
it
then
i
ought
to
have
confessed
again
and
this
priest
who
will
give
me
the
communion
this
priest
the
horror
which
he
felt
for
this
man
increased
suddenly
and
became
so
vehement
that
he
was
astonished
ah
but
there
i
am
again
knocked
about
by
the
enemy
he
said
and
he
went
on
all
that
shall
not
prevent
me
from
receiving
the
heavenly
bread
for
i
have
quite
decided
only
how
frightful
it
is
that
the
spirit
of
malice
should
be
allowed
to
oppress
and
harass
me
without
respite
while
i
have
no
sign
from
heaven
which
does
not
interfere
and
i
know
nothing
ah
lord
if
i
were
only
certain
this
communion
would
please
thee
give
me
a
sign
show
me
that
i
may
ally
myself
with
thee
without
remorse
let
the
impossible
take
place
so
that
it
may
be
a
monk
and
not
this
priest
and
he
stopped
himself
astonished
at
his
boldness
asking
himself
how
he
dared
ask
for
and
indicate
a
sign
it
is
idiotic
he
exclaimed
in
the
first
place
no
one
has
a
right
to
claim
such
favours
from
god
and
then
as
he
will
not
grant
my
prayer
what
shall
i
have
gained
i
shall
infer
from
the
refusal
that
my
communion
will
be
worth
nothing
and
he
prayed
the
lord
to
forget
his
wish
excused
himself
for
having
formed
it
and
wished
to
convince
himself
that
he
should
not
take
it
into
account
and
helped
by
the
agitations
of
the
day
he
ended
by
falling
asleep
as
he
prayed
chapter
iv
when
he
left
his
cell
he
said
to
himself
this
morning
i
shall
communicate
and
these
words
which
should
have
thrilled
him
through
and
through
woke
no
zeal
in
him
he
remained
dull
tired
and
caring
for
nothing
feeling
cold
in
the
depth
of
his
being
nevertheless
a
fear
stimulated
him
when
he
was
outside
i
do
not
know
he
said
to
himself
when
i
must
leave
my
seat
and
go
to
kneel
before
the
priest
i
know
that
the
congregation
should
communicate
after
the
celebrant
but
at
what
moment
exactly
ought
i
to
move
it
is
indeed
another
misfortune
that
i
should
have
to
go
up
alone
towards
this
table
which
so
disturbs
me
otherwise
i
shall
only
have
to
follow
the
others
and
at
least
be
sure
of
not
doing
anything
improperly
he
scrutinized
the
chapel
as
he
went
in
looking
round
for
bruno
who
had
he
been
by
his
side
might
have
kept
off
his
scruples
but
the
oblate
could
not
be
found
durtal
sat
down
disabled
dreaming
of
the
sign
he
had
asked
for
the
evening
before
endeavouring
to
throw
off
the
recollection
thinking
of
it
all
the
same
he
wished
to
examine
himself
and
collect
himself
and
he
was
praying
heaven
to
forgive
him
his
mental
vacillations
when
bruno
came
in
and
went
to
kneel
before
the
statue
of
the
virgin
almost
at
the
same
minute
a
brother
who
had
a
beard
like
seaweed
growing
from
a
face
like
a
pear
took
up
to
the
altar
of
joseph
a
small
rustic
table
on
which
he
placed
a
basin
a
towel
two
vases
and
a
napkin
before
these
preparations
which
recalled
the
imminence
of
the
sacrifice
durtal
stiffened
himself
and
succeeded
by
an
effort
in
keeping
back
his
anxieties
and
overthrowing
his
troubles
and
escaping
from
himself
he
ardently
implored
our
lady
to
intervene
so
that
he
might
for
this
hour
at
least
without
wandering
pray
in
peace
and
when
he
had
finished
his
prayer
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
with
a
start
at
the
priest
who
was
advancing
preceded
by
a
lay
brother
to
celebrate
mass
this
was
not
the
curate
whom
he
knew
but
another
younger
very
tall
with
a
majestic
air
with
cheeks
pale
and
shaven
and
a
bald
head
durtal
was
watching
him
solemnly
marching
towards
the
altar
with
his
eyes
cast
down
when
he
suddenly
noticed
a
violet
flame
light
up
his
fingers
he
wears
an
episcopal
ring
he
is
a
bishop
thought
durtal
who
leant
forward
to
see
the
colour
of
the
vestment
underneath
the
chasuble
and
alb
it
was
white
then
it
is
a
monk
he
said
astounded
and
mechanically
he
turned
towards
the
statue
of
the
virgin
summoning
the
oblate
by
a
hasty
glance
who
came
to
sit
beside
him
who
is
he
dom
anselm
the
abbot
of
the
monastery
he
who
was
ill
yes
he
will
give
us
communion
durtal
fell
upon
his
knees
suffocated
almost
trembling
he
was
not
dreaming
heaven
was
answering
him
by
the
sign
on
which
he
had
fixed
he
ought
to
abase
himself
before
god
to
be
overwhelmed
at
his
feet
to
spread
himself
in
a
passion
of
gratitude
he
knew
and
wished
it
and
without
knowing
how
he
was
exercising
himself
in
seeking
natural
causes
which
might
account
for
the
substitution
of
a
monk
for
the
priest
no
doubt
it
was
very
simple
for
on
the
whole
before
admitting
a
kind
of
miracle
anyhow
i
will
keep
an
open
mind
for
after
the
ceremony
i
wish
to
clear
the
matter
up
and
he
repelled
the
insinuations
which
crept
into
him
well
what
interest
could
there
be
in
the
motive
of
this
change
there
clearly
must
be
a
motive
but
it
was
only
a
consequence
an
accessory
the
important
point
was
the
supernatural
will
which
had
produced
it
in
any
case
you
have
obtained
more
than
you
asked
you
have
even
a
better
than
the
simple
monk
you
wished
for
you
have
the
abbot
of
la
trappe
himself
and
he
cried
oh
to
believe
to
believe
like
these
poor
lay
brothers
not
to
be
endowed
with
a
soul
which
is
blown
about
by
every
wind
to
have
the
faith
of
a
child
an
immovable
faith
a
faith
which
can
not
be
rooted
up
ah
father
father
bury
it
rivet
it
in
me
and
such
was
his
enthusiasm
that
he
came
out
of
himself
all
around
him
seemed
to
disappear
and
he
cried
stammering
to
christ
lord
go
not
far
from
me
let
thy
pity
curb
thy
justice
be
unjust
forgive
me
receive
thy
poor
bedesman
for
communion
the
poor
in
spirit
bruno
touched
his
arm
and
with
a
glance
invited
him
to
accompany
him
they
went
up
to
the
altar
and
knelt
upon
the
flagstones
then
when
the
priest
had
blessed
them
they
knelt
closer
on
the
single
step
and
the
lay
brother
handed
them
a
napkin
for
there
was
no
bar
or
cloth
and
the
abbot
of
la
trappe
gave
them
the
communion
they
returned
to
their
places
durtal
was
in
a
state
of
absolute
torpor
the
sacrament
had
in
a
manner
anæsthetized
his
mind
he
fell
on
his
knees
at
his
bench
incapable
even
of
unravelling
what
might
be
moving
within
him
unable
to
rally
and
pull
himself
together
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
impression
came
over
him
that
he
was
suffocating
and
wanted
air
the
mass
was
finished
he
rushed
out
and
ran
to
his
walk
there
he
wished
to
take
an
account
of
himself
and
he
found
nothing
and
in
front
of
the
cross
pond
in
whose
waters
the
christ
was
drowning
there
came
over
him
an
infinite
melancholy
a
vast
sadness
it
was
a
true
syncope
of
the
soul
it
lost
consciousness
and
when
it
came
to
itself
he
was
astonished
that
he
had
not
felt
an
unknown
transport
of
joy
then
he
dwelt
on
a
troublesome
recollection
on
the
all
too
human
side
of
the
deglutition
of
a
god
the
host
had
stuck
against
his
palate
and
he
had
had
to
seek
it
with
his
tongue
and
roll
it
about
like
a
pancake
in
order
to
swallow
it
ah
it
was
still
too
material
he
only
wanted
a
fluid
a
perfume
a
fire
a
breath
and
he
tried
to
explain
to
himself
the
treatment
that
the
saviour
made
him
follow
all
his
anticipations
had
returned
it
was
the
absolution
and
not
the
communion
which
had
worked
when
with
the
confessor
he
had
very
clearly
perceived
the
presence
of
the
redeemer
all
his
being
had
in
a
manner
been
injected
with
divine
effluvia
and
the
eucharist
had
only
brought
him
suffocation
and
trouble
it
seemed
that
the
effects
of
the
two
sacraments
had
changed
places
the
one
with
the
other
they
had
worked
the
wrong
way
with
him
christ
had
been
perceptible
to
his
soul
before
and
not
afterwards
but
it
is
easy
enough
to
see
he
reflected
that
the
great
question
for
me
is
to
have
an
absolute
certainty
of
my
forgiveness
by
a
special
favour
jesus
has
ratified
my
faith
in
the
healing
power
of
penance
why
should
he
have
done
more
and
then
what
bounties
would
he
reserve
for
his
saints
after
all
i
am
astonishing
it
is
too
much
that
i
should
wish
to
be
treated
as
he
certainly
treats
brother
anacletus
and
brother
simeon
i
have
obtained
more
than
i
deserve
and
what
an
answer
i
had
this
very
morning
yes
indeed
but
why
should
such
advances
end
suddenly
in
this
recoil
and
making
his
way
towards
the
abbey
to
eat
his
bread
and
cheese
he
said
to
himself
my
error
towards
god
is
to
be
always
arguing
when
i
ought
to
adore
stupidly
as
these
monks
here
do
ah
to
be
able
to
keep
silence
silence
to
one
self
that
is
indeed
a
grace
he
reached
the
refectory
which
as
a
rule
he
had
to
himself
bruno
never
coming
to
the
meal
at
seven
in
the
morning
he
was
beginning
to
cut
himself
a
piece
of
bread
when
the
father
appeared
he
had
a
whetstone
and
some
knives
in
his
hand
and
smiling
at
durtal
he
said
i
am
going
to
polish
the
knives
of
the
monastery
for
they
want
it
badly
and
he
placed
them
on
a
table
in
a
small
room
attached
to
the
refectory
well
are
you
satisfied
he
said
on
coming
back
certainly
but
what
happened
this
morning
how
is
it
i
was
communicated
by
the
abbot
of
la
trappe
when
i
should
have
been
by
the
curate
who
dines
with
me
ah
exclaimed
the
monk
i
was
as
much
surprised
as
you
on
waking
the
father
abbot
suddenly
declared
that
he
must
say
mass
this
morning
he
got
up
in
spite
of
the
observations
of
the
prior
who
as
a
doctor
forbade
him
to
leave
his
bed
neither
i
nor
any
one
else
knows
what
took
him
then
they
told
him
that
a
retreatant
would
communicate
and
he
answered
so
i
shall
communicate
him
and
then
bruno
took
the
opportunity
of
also
approaching
the
sacrament
for
he
loves
to
receive
our
saviour
from
the
hands
of
dom
anselm
and
this
arrangement
also
satisfied
the
curate
the
monk
went
on
smiling
for
he
left
la
trappe
at
an
earlier
hour
this
morning
and
has
been
able
to
say
his
mass
in
a
parish
where
he
was
expected
by
the
way
he
told
me
to
make
his
excuses
to
you
for
not
having
been
able
to
bid
you
durtal
bowed
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
he
thought
god
wished
to
give
me
an
unmistakable
answer
and
your
health
it
is
good
father
i
am
astounded
my
digestion
has
never
been
so
good
as
it
is
here
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
the
neuralgia
which
i
feared
so
much
has
spared
me
that
shows
that
heaven
protects
you
yes
indeed
but
now
that
i
remember
it
i
have
long
wished
to
ask
you
this
how
are
your
offices
arranged
they
do
not
correspond
with
those
printed
in
my
no
they
differ
from
yours
which
belong
to
the
roman
ritual
at
the
same
time
the
vespers
are
almost
similar
except
sometimes
the
lessons
and
then
what
may
put
you
out
is
that
ours
are
often
preceded
by
the
vespers
of
the
blessed
virgin
as
a
general
rule
we
have
a
psalm
less
in
the
office
and
the
lessons
are
nearly
always
short
except
father
etienne
went
on
smiling
in
compline
the
very
one
you
recite
thus
you
may
have
noticed
we
know
nothing
of
manus
tuas
domine
which
is
one
of
the
few
short
lessons
sung
in
parish
churches
we
have
also
a
special
proper
of
saints
we
celebrate
the
commemoration
of
the
blessed
of
our
order
which
you
will
not
find
in
your
books
in
fact
we
follow
the
letter
of
the
monastic
breviary
of
saint
benedict
durtal
had
finished
his
breakfast
he
rose
fearing
to
trouble
the
father
by
his
questions
one
word
of
the
monk
however
was
troubling
his
brain
that
relating
to
the
prior
as
a
doctor
and
before
going
out
he
spoke
of
this
again
to
father
etienne
no
the
reverend
father
maximin
is
not
a
doctor
but
he
understands
simples
very
well
and
he
has
a
small
pharmacy
which
is
enough
as
long
as
no
one
is
seriously
and
in
that
case
in
that
case
the
practitioner
can
be
called
in
from
one
of
the
nearest
towns
but
no
one
is
ever
so
ill
as
that
or
else
the
end
is
approaching
and
the
doctor
visit
would
be
useless
so
on
the
whole
the
prior
looks
after
soul
and
body
at
la
trappe
the
monk
signified
assent
durtal
went
out
he
hoped
to
get
rid
of
his
suffocation
by
a
long
walk
he
took
a
road
which
he
had
not
been
along
before
and
came
out
on
a
glade
where
stood
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
convent
some
bits
of
wall
truncated
columns
and
capitals
in
the
roman
style
unhappily
these
remains
were
in
a
deplorable
condition
rough
covered
with
moss
and
riddled
with
holes
like
pumice
stones
he
went
on
and
came
to
the
end
of
a
long
walk
at
the
top
of
which
was
a
pond
five
or
six
times
as
large
as
the
small
one
in
the
form
of
a
cross
which
he
frequented
the
walk
was
planted
with
old
oaks
on
each
side
and
in
the
middle
near
a
wooden
bench
stood
a
statue
of
the
virgin
he
groaned
as
he
looked
at
it
the
crime
of
the
church
followed
him
once
more
even
in
this
little
chapel
so
full
of
divine
compassion
all
the
statues
came
from
the
religious
bazaars
of
paris
or
lyons
he
took
his
position
below
near
the
pond
whose
banks
were
bordered
by
reeds
surrounded
by
tufts
of
osiers
and
he
amused
himself
by
examining
the
colours
of
these
shrubs
with
their
smooth
green
leaves
and
stalks
of
citron
yellow
or
blood
red
noticing
the
curling
water
which
began
to
foam
with
a
gust
of
wind
and
the
martins
skimmed
it
touching
it
with
the
tips
of
their
wings
from
which
drops
of
water
fell
like
pearls
of
quicksilver
and
the
birds
rose
whirling
above
and
giving
out
their
cries
of
weet
weet
weet
while
the
shone
brightly
in
the
air
which
they
slashed
with
blue
flames
peaceful
refuge
thought
durtal
i
ought
to
have
come
to
rest
here
before
he
sat
down
on
a
bed
of
moss
and
interested
himself
in
the
noiseless
and
active
life
of
the
waters
now
the
splash
and
flash
of
the
turn
of
a
leaping
carp
now
great
spiders
skating
on
the
surface
making
little
circles
and
driving
one
against
another
stopping
going
back
and
making
new
rounds
then
near
him
on
the
ground
durtal
noticed
jumping
green
grasshoppers
with
vermilion
bellies
or
scaling
the
oaks
colonies
of
queer
insects
on
whose
backs
a
devil
head
was
painted
in
red
lead
on
a
black
ground
and
above
all
that
if
he
raised
his
eyes
there
was
the
silent
upturned
sea
of
heaven
a
blue
sea
crested
with
surging
white
clouds
like
waves
and
at
the
same
time
this
firmament
moved
in
the
water
where
it
billowed
under
a
blueish
gray
glass
durtal
felt
himself
expand
as
he
smoked
cigarettes
the
melancholy
which
had
oppressed
him
since
the
dawn
began
to
melt
away
and
joy
crept
into
him
as
he
felt
his
soul
was
washed
in
the
pool
of
the
sacraments
and
dried
in
the
air
of
a
cloister
and
he
was
at
once
happy
and
uneasy
happy
for
the
meeting
he
had
had
with
the
father
had
removed
all
the
doubts
he
had
entertained
as
to
the
supernatural
side
to
the
sudden
change
of
a
priest
for
a
monk
to
communicate
him
happy
also
to
know
that
not
only
had
christ
not
repulsed
him
in
spite
of
all
the
disorders
of
his
life
but
that
he
was
encouraging
him
and
giving
him
pledges
ratifying
the
signs
of
his
favours
by
perceptible
acts
and
nevertheless
he
was
uneasy
for
he
knew
himself
to
be
barren
and
felt
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
be
grateful
for
this
goodness
by
a
struggle
with
himself
and
an
entirely
new
existence
differing
completely
from
that
he
had
hitherto
led
well
we
shall
see
and
he
went
off
to
the
office
of
sext
almost
calmed
and
thence
to
dinner
where
he
found
bruno
we
will
go
for
a
walk
said
the
oblate
rubbing
his
hands
durtal
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
yes
indeed
i
thought
that
after
a
communion
a
little
air
outside
the
walls
would
do
you
good
and
i
proposed
to
the
reverend
father
abbot
to
free
you
from
the
rule
for
if
the
offer
is
not
disagreeable
to
you
i
gladly
accept
and
thank
you
sincerely
for
your
kind
attention
said
durtal
they
dined
off
a
soup
made
with
oil
in
which
a
stick
of
cabbage
and
some
peas
were
swimming
it
was
not
bad
but
the
bread
made
at
la
trappe
reminded
him
when
stale
of
the
bread
in
the
siege
of
paris
and
made
the
soup
turn
sour
then
they
tasted
an
egg
with
sorrel
and
some
rice
steeped
in
milk
if
it
suits
you
said
the
oblate
we
will
begin
by
paying
a
visit
to
dom
anselm
who
has
expressed
a
wish
to
know
you
and
bruno
led
durtal
through
a
labyrinth
of
passages
and
staircases
to
a
small
cell
where
the
abbot
was
he
was
dressed
like
the
fathers
in
a
white
robe
and
a
black
scapular
only
at
the
end
of
a
violet
cord
he
bore
on
his
breast
an
abbot
cross
of
ivory
in
the
centre
of
which
under
a
round
glass
some
relics
were
inserted
he
gave
his
hand
to
durtal
and
begged
him
to
sit
down
then
he
asked
if
the
food
seemed
to
be
enough
for
him
and
on
receiving
a
reply
in
the
affirmative
from
durtal
he
inquired
if
the
long
silence
did
not
weigh
upon
him
too
much
not
at
all
this
solitude
suits
me
perfectly
well
said
the
abbot
laughing
you
are
one
of
the
few
laymen
who
have
borne
our
rule
so
easily
generally
those
who
have
tried
to
make
a
retreat
here
have
been
devoured
by
home
sickness
and
spleen
and
have
had
but
one
idea
to
get
away
let
us
see
he
said
after
a
pause
it
is
not
possible
all
the
same
that
such
a
sudden
change
of
habits
should
not
bring
with
it
some
painful
privations
there
must
be
at
least
one
which
you
feel
above
all
the
others
true
i
feel
the
want
of
being
able
to
light
a
cigarette
whenever
i
like
the
abbot
answered
smiling
but
i
suppose
you
have
not
been
entirely
without
smoking
since
you
came
here
i
should
tell
a
lie
if
i
said
i
had
not
smoked
in
secret
why
bless
me
tobacco
was
not
foreseen
by
benedict
there
is
no
mention
of
it
in
his
rule
and
i
am
therefore
free
to
allow
its
use
so
smoke
as
many
cigarettes
as
you
like
without
being
uneasy
and
dom
anselm
added
i
hope
shortly
to
have
a
little
more
time
to
myself
unless
indeed
i
am
obliged
to
keep
my
room
in
that
case
i
shall
be
happy
to
have
a
longer
talk
with
you
and
the
monk
who
seemed
exhausted
shook
them
by
the
hand
going
down
into
the
court
with
the
oblate
durtal
exclaimed
the
father
abbot
is
charming
and
quite
young
he
is
hardly
forty
he
appears
to
be
really
yes
he
is
not
well
and
he
required
no
common
energy
to
say
his
mass
this
morning
but
let
us
see
we
will
first
of
all
visit
the
grounds
of
la
trappe
which
you
can
hardly
have
been
over
completely
then
we
will
leave
the
enclosure
and
push
on
to
the
farm
they
started
skirting
the
remains
of
the
ancient
abbey
and
as
they
walked
turning
by
the
piece
of
water
near
which
durtal
had
been
seated
in
the
morning
bruno
entered
into
explanations
about
the
ruins
this
monastery
was
founded
in
by
bernard
who
installed
the
blessed
humbert
as
abbot
an
epileptic
cistercian
whom
he
had
cured
by
a
miracle
at
that
time
there
were
apparitions
in
the
convent
a
legend
relates
that
two
angels
came
and
cut
one
of
the
lilies
planted
in
the
cemetery
every
time
one
of
the
monks
died
the
second
abbot
was
the
blessed
guerric
who
was
famous
for
his
knowledge
his
humility
and
his
patience
in
enduring
evils
we
possess
his
relics
and
they
are
enclosed
in
the
shrine
under
the
high
altar
but
the
most
remarkable
of
the
superiors
who
succeeded
each
other
here
in
the
middle
ages
was
peter
monoculus
whose
story
was
written
by
his
friend
the
member
of
the
synod
thomas
de
reuil
pierre
called
monoculus
or
the
was
a
saint
thirsting
for
austerities
and
sufferings
he
was
assailed
by
horrible
temptations
at
which
he
laughed
exasperated
the
devil
attacked
his
body
and
by
fits
of
neuralgia
broke
his
skull
but
heaven
came
to
his
aid
and
cured
it
by
shedding
tears
from
a
spirit
of
penitence
peter
lost
an
eye
and
he
thanked
our
lord
for
this
blessing
had
he
said
enemies
i
have
escaped
the
first
but
the
one
i
retain
troubles
me
more
than
the
one
i
have
lost
he
worked
miracles
of
healing
the
king
of
france
louis
venerated
him
so
much
that
on
seeing
the
empty
eyelid
he
wished
to
kiss
it
monoculus
died
in
they
soaked
linen
cloths
in
his
blood
and
washed
his
entrails
in
wine
which
was
distributed
for
the
mixture
was
a
powerful
remedy
the
property
of
the
abbey
was
then
immense
it
comprised
all
the
country
which
surrounds
us
kept
up
several
lazar
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
and
was
the
home
of
more
than
three
hundred
monks
unfortunately
what
happened
to
others
happened
to
de
under
the
rule
of
abbots
in
commendam
it
declined
and
it
was
dying
with
only
six
religious
to
look
after
it
when
the
revolution
suppressed
it
the
church
was
then
pulled
down
and
afterwards
replaced
by
the
rotunda
chapel
only
in
the
present
house
which
i
think
dates
from
was
reconciled
and
became
a
monastery
again
trappists
were
brought
here
from
sainte
marie
de
la
mer
in
the
diocese
of
toulouse
and
this
small
colony
has
made
de
the
cistercian
nursery
you
see
such
in
few
words
is
the
history
of
the
convent
said
the
oblate
as
for
the
ruins
they
are
buried
underground
and
no
doubt
precious
fragments
might
be
discovered
but
for
want
of
money
and
men
no
excavations
have
been
made
in
addition
to
the
broken
columns
and
the
capitals
we
passed
there
remains
from
the
old
church
a
large
statue
of
the
virgin
which
has
been
erected
in
one
of
the
corridors
of
the
abbey
besides
this
there
are
two
angels
fairly
well
preserved
and
which
you
may
see
down
there
at
the
end
of
the
cloister
in
a
small
chapel
hidden
behind
a
curtain
of
trees
a
virgin
before
which
bernard
may
possibly
have
knelt
ought
surely
to
have
been
put
in
the
church
on
the
altar
dedicated
to
mary
for
the
coloured
statue
which
surmounts
it
is
of
crying
ugliness
like
that
one
also
said
durtal
pointing
out
in
the
distance
the
madonna
which
towered
above
the
pond
the
oblate
bowed
his
head
and
did
not
reply
do
you
know
exclaimed
durtal
who
in
the
face
of
this
silence
did
not
persist
and
changed
the
conversation
do
you
know
that
i
envy
you
living
here
it
is
certain
that
i
do
not
deserve
this
favour
for
on
the
whole
the
cloister
is
less
an
expiation
than
a
reward
it
is
the
only
place
where
far
from
the
world
and
near
heaven
the
only
place
where
a
man
may
give
himself
up
to
this
mystic
life
which
only
develops
in
solitude
and
silence
yes
and
if
possible
i
envy
you
yet
more
that
you
should
have
had
the
courage
to
venture
into
regions
which
i
confess
frightened
me
and
i
know
so
well
that
in
spite
of
the
of
prayers
and
fasts
in
spite
of
the
green
house
or
orchid
house
atmosphere
wherein
mysticism
is
grown
i
should
wither
away
in
these
regions
without
ever
expanding
again
the
oblate
smiled
what
do
you
know
about
it
he
replied
the
thing
is
not
done
in
an
hour
the
orchid
you
speak
of
does
not
flower
in
a
day
the
advance
is
so
slow
that
mortifications
space
themselves
out
fatigues
are
distributed
over
years
and
on
the
whole
are
easily
borne
as
a
general
rule
it
is
necessary
to
cross
the
distance
which
separates
us
from
the
creator
to
go
through
three
grades
to
attain
that
science
of
christian
perfection
which
is
called
mysticism
we
must
live
in
turn
the
life
of
purification
of
illumination
and
of
unity
to
join
the
uncreated
good
and
be
poured
out
in
him
it
matters
little
that
these
three
grand
phases
of
ascetic
existence
subdivide
themselves
into
an
infinity
of
stages
which
are
degrees
according
to
saint
bonaventure
dwelling
places
according
to
saint
teresa
steps
according
to
saint
angela
they
may
vary
in
length
and
number
according
to
the
will
of
the
lord
and
the
temperament
of
those
who
go
through
them
it
is
not
disputed
that
the
journey
of
the
soul
towards
god
includes
first
perpendicular
and
breakneck
roads
these
are
the
roads
of
the
life
of
purification
next
narrower
paths
still
but
well
marked
out
and
accessible
these
are
the
paths
of
the
life
of
illumination
at
length
a
wide
road
almost
smooth
the
road
of
the
life
of
unity
at
the
end
of
which
the
soul
throws
itself
into
the
furnace
of
love
and
falls
into
the
abyss
of
the
most
adorable
infinity
on
the
whole
these
three
ways
are
successively
reserved
to
those
who
start
in
christian
asceticism
to
those
who
practise
it
and
finally
to
those
who
attain
to
the
supreme
end
the
death
of
self
and
the
life
in
god
long
pursued
the
oblate
i
have
placed
my
desires
beyond
the
horizon
yet
i
progress
little
i
am
scarcely
disengaged
from
the
life
of
purification
scarcely
and
you
do
not
fear
how
shall
i
say
material
infirmities
for
if
at
last
you
succeed
in
attaining
the
limits
of
contemplation
you
risk
the
ruin
of
your
body
for
ever
experience
seems
to
show
in
effect
that
the
deified
soul
acts
on
the
constitution
and
brings
incurable
troubles
the
oblate
smiled
in
the
first
place
i
should
no
doubt
fail
to
attain
to
the
last
degree
of
initiation
the
extreme
point
of
mysticism
then
supposing
i
attain
it
what
would
corporal
accidents
be
in
the
face
of
such
results
let
me
also
assure
you
that
these
accidents
are
neither
so
frequent
nor
so
certain
as
you
seem
to
think
a
man
may
be
a
great
mystic
or
an
admirable
saint
and
not
be
the
subject
of
visible
phenomena
for
those
who
surround
him
would
you
not
think
for
example
that
levitation
or
the
flight
of
bodies
in
the
air
which
seems
to
constitute
the
highest
state
of
rapture
is
one
of
the
rarest
whom
can
you
quote
to
me
saint
teresa
saint
christina
the
admirable
saint
peter
of
alcantara
dominic
of
mary
jesus
agnes
of
bohemia
margaret
of
the
blessed
sacrament
the
blessed
gorardesca
of
pisa
and
above
all
saint
joseph
of
cupertino
who
raised
himself
at
will
from
the
ground
but
they
are
ten
or
twenty
out
of
thousands
of
the
elect
and
note
well
that
these
gifts
do
not
prove
their
superiority
over
other
saints
saint
teresa
declares
expressly
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
anyone
blessed
as
he
may
be
in
this
respect
is
better
than
those
who
are
not
so
blessed
for
our
lord
directs
each
one
according
to
his
particular
need
and
then
the
doctrine
of
the
church
is
seen
in
the
untiring
prudence
shown
in
the
canonization
of
the
dead
qualities
and
not
extraordinary
acts
decide
this
for
the
church
miracles
themselves
are
only
secondary
proofs
for
she
knows
that
the
spirit
of
evil
imitates
them
in
the
lives
of
the
blessed
you
will
find
too
the
most
unusual
deeds
and
more
amazing
phenomena
than
in
the
biographies
of
the
saints
these
phenomena
have
rather
hindered
than
helped
them
after
having
beatified
them
for
their
virtues
the
church
has
put
off
and
no
doubt
for
a
long
time
their
promotion
to
the
sovereign
dignity
of
saints
it
is
difficult
on
the
whole
to
formulate
an
exact
theory
on
this
subject
for
if
the
cause
if
the
mental
action
is
the
same
in
all
mystics
it
differs
a
little
as
i
have
said
according
to
god
will
and
the
character
of
the
subjects
the
difference
of
sex
often
changes
the
form
of
the
mystic
flow
though
in
essence
it
never
varies
the
rush
of
the
spirit
from
on
high
may
produce
different
effects
but
is
none
the
less
identical
the
only
observation
we
dare
make
in
these
matters
is
that
women
as
a
rule
are
more
passive
and
less
reserved
while
men
resist
more
violently
the
wishes
of
heaven
that
makes
me
think
said
durtal
that
even
in
religion
there
are
souls
which
seem
to
have
mistaken
their
sex
saint
francis
of
assisi
who
was
all
love
had
rather
the
feminine
soul
of
a
nun
and
saint
teresa
who
was
the
most
attentive
of
psychologists
had
the
virile
soul
of
a
monk
we
might
correctly
speak
of
saint
francis
as
a
woman
and
saint
teresa
as
a
man
the
oblate
smiled
to
return
to
your
question
he
resumed
i
do
not
at
all
believe
that
illness
can
be
the
necessary
consequence
of
phenomena
aroused
by
the
impetuous
force
of
mysticism
but
look
at
saint
colette
lidwine
saint
aldegonde
of
the
cross
sister
emmerich
and
how
many
more
who
passed
their
existence
half
paralyzed
upon
a
bed
they
are
a
small
minority
besides
the
saints
or
blessed
ones
whose
names
you
quote
were
victims
of
substitution
expiating
the
sins
of
others
a
part
god
had
reserved
to
them
it
is
not
therefore
surprising
that
they
were
and
cripples
and
were
constantly
half
dead
no
the
truth
is
that
mysticism
can
modify
the
needs
of
the
body
without
for
all
that
having
much
effect
on
or
destroying
the
health
i
know
well
you
would
answer
me
with
that
terrible
phrase
of
saint
hildegarde
a
phrase
at
once
just
and
sinister
lord
dwells
not
in
the
bodies
of
the
healthy
and
vigorous
and
you
might
add
with
saint
teresa
that
evils
are
more
frequent
in
the
last
of
the
castles
of
the
soul
yes
but
these
saints
hoist
themselves
on
the
summit
of
life
and
retain
god
in
a
permanent
manner
in
their
carnal
shell
having
reached
this
point
nature
too
feeble
to
support
a
perfect
state
gives
way
but
i
assert
again
these
cases
are
an
exception
and
not
a
rule
and
alas
such
maladies
are
not
contagious
i
am
quite
aware
resumed
the
oblate
after
a
pause
that
the
very
existence
of
mysticism
is
resolutely
denied
by
some
who
in
consequence
can
never
admit
the
possibility
of
any
influence
over
the
bodily
organs
but
the
experience
of
this
supernatural
reality
is
from
all
time
and
proofs
abound
let
us
take
the
stomach
for
example
well
under
the
heavenly
influence
it
becomes
transformed
omits
all
earthly
nourishment
and
consumes
the
holy
species
only
saint
catherine
of
siena
and
angela
of
foligno
lived
for
years
exclusively
on
the
sacrament
and
this
gift
devolved
equally
upon
saint
colette
saint
lidwine
dominic
of
paradise
saint
columba
of
rieti
mary
bagnesi
rose
of
lima
saint
peter
of
alcantara
mother
agnes
of
langeac
and
on
many
others
under
the
divine
impress
the
senses
of
smell
and
taste
presented
no
less
strange
metamorphoses
saint
philip
nevi
saint
angela
saint
margaret
of
cortona
recognized
a
special
taste
in
unleavened
bread
when
after
the
consecration
there
was
no
longer
any
wheat
but
the
very
flesh
of
christ
saint
pacomius
knew
heretics
by
their
foul
smell
saint
catherine
of
siena
saint
joseph
of
cupertino
and
mother
agnes
of
jesus
discovered
sins
by
their
evil
odours
saint
hilarion
saint
lutgarde
gentilla
of
ravenna
could
tell
merely
by
the
scent
of
those
whom
they
met
what
faults
they
had
committed
and
the
saints
themselves
whether
living
or
dead
exhaled
powerful
perfumes
when
saint
francis
de
paul
and
venturini
of
bergamo
offered
the
sacrifice
they
smelt
sweet
saint
joseph
of
cupertino
secreted
such
fragrant
odours
that
his
track
could
be
followed
and
sometimes
it
was
during
illness
that
these
aromas
were
diffused
the
pus
of
saint
john
of
the
cross
and
of
the
blessed
didée
gave
forth
strong
and
distinct
scent
of
lilies
barthole
the
tertiary
gnawed
to
the
bones
by
leprosy
gave
out
pleasant
emanations
and
the
same
was
the
case
with
lidwine
ida
of
louvain
saint
colette
saint
humiliana
of
genoa
dominic
of
paradise
whose
wounds
were
boxes
of
perfume
whence
fresh
scents
escaped
and
thus
we
can
enumerate
organs
and
senses
one
after
another
and
declare
marvellous
effects
without
speaking
of
those
faithful
stigmata
which
open
or
shut
according
to
the
proper
of
the
liturgical
year
what
is
more
astounding
than
the
gift
of
bilocation
the
power
of
doubling
oneself
of
being
in
two
places
at
the
same
time
at
the
same
moment
and
yet
what
numerous
examples
exist
of
this
incredible
fact
many
are
celebrated
amongst
others
those
of
saint
antony
of
padua
saint
francis
xavier
marie
of
agreda
who
was
at
the
same
time
in
her
monastery
in
spain
and
in
mexico
when
she
was
preaching
to
infidels
mother
agnes
of
jesus
who
came
to
visit
olier
at
paris
without
leaving
her
convent
at
langeac
and
again
the
action
from
on
high
seems
singularly
energetic
when
it
takes
hold
of
the
central
organ
of
circulation
the
motor
which
drives
the
blood
into
all
parts
of
the
body
numbers
of
the
elect
had
such
a
burning
heart
that
the
linen
they
wore
was
singed
the
fire
which
consumed
ursula
benincasa
the
foundress
of
the
theatines
was
so
strong
that
this
saint
breathed
columns
of
smoke
as
soon
as
she
opened
her
mouth
saint
catherine
of
genoa
dipped
her
feet
or
her
hands
in
iced
water
and
the
water
boiled
snow
melted
round
saint
peter
of
alcantara
and
one
day
when
the
blessed
gerlach
was
crossing
a
forest
in
the
depth
of
winter
he
advised
his
companion
who
walked
behind
him
and
who
could
not
go
on
as
his
legs
were
numb
to
put
his
feet
into
his
footsteps
and
immediately
he
ceased
to
feel
cold
i
will
add
that
certain
of
these
phenomena
which
make
freethinkers
smile
have
been
renewed
and
have
been
verified
quite
recently
linen
scorched
by
the
fire
of
the
heart
has
been
observed
by
on
the
stigmatized
palma
and
phenomena
of
high
mysticism
which
no
science
can
explain
were
watched
in
the
case
of
louise
lateau
minute
by
minute
and
noted
and
controlled
by
professor
rohling
lafebvre
imbert
gourbeyre
de
noüe
by
medical
delegates
from
all
countries
but
here
we
are
said
the
oblate
excuse
me
i
will
go
first
to
show
you
the
way
they
had
left
the
enclosure
as
he
spoke
and
cutting
across
the
fields
reached
an
immense
farm
trappists
bowed
respectfully
as
they
entered
the
court
yard
bruno
addressing
himself
to
one
of
them
asked
him
to
be
good
enough
to
take
them
over
the
property
the
lay
brother
took
them
to
the
cattle
sheds
then
to
the
stables
then
to
the
poultry
yard
durtal
who
was
not
interested
in
such
sights
confined
himself
to
admiring
the
grace
of
these
good
people
no
one
spoke
but
they
replied
to
questions
by
signs
and
winks
but
how
do
they
communicate
with
each
other
asked
durtal
when
they
were
outside
the
farm
you
have
just
seen
they
correspond
by
signs
they
have
a
simpler
alphabet
than
that
of
the
deaf
and
dumb
for
each
idea
that
they
may
require
to
express
for
their
common
work
is
foreseen
thus
the
word
is
translated
by
one
hand
tapping
on
the
other
the
word
by
scratching
the
left
forefinger
sleep
is
feigned
by
leaning
the
head
upon
the
fist
drink
by
raising
a
closed
hand
to
the
lips
and
for
more
spiritual
expressions
they
employ
a
like
method
confession
is
translated
by
a
finger
kissed
and
laid
upon
the
heart
holy
water
by
five
fingers
of
the
left
hand
clasped
on
which
a
cross
is
made
with
the
thumb
of
the
right
hand
fasting
by
fingers
which
close
the
mouth
the
word
by
turning
the
arm
back
towards
the
shoulder
shame
by
covering
the
eyes
with
the
hand
but
supposing
they
wished
to
indicate
me
who
am
not
one
of
themselves
how
would
they
set
about
it
they
would
use
the
sign
of
which
they
make
by
stretching
out
the
hand
and
bringing
it
near
the
body
that
means
that
i
come
to
them
from
far
an
open
and
even
transparent
fact
if
you
like
they
went
silently
along
a
walk
which
led
down
into
the
labour
fields
i
have
not
noticed
brother
anacletus
or
old
simeon
among
these
monks
exclaimed
durtal
suddenly
they
are
not
occupied
on
the
farm
brother
anacletus
is
employed
in
the
chocolate
factory
and
brother
simeon
looks
after
the
pigs
both
are
working
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
monastery
if
you
like
we
will
go
and
wish
simeon
and
the
oblate
added
you
can
tell
them
when
you
go
back
to
paris
that
you
have
seen
a
real
saint
such
as
existed
in
the
eleventh
century
he
carries
us
back
to
the
time
of
francis
of
assisi
he
is
in
some
sense
the
reincarnation
of
that
astonishing
juniper
whose
innocent
exploits
the
fioretti
celebrate
for
us
you
know
that
work
yes
after
the
golden
legend
it
is
the
book
on
which
the
soul
of
the
middle
ages
is
most
clearly
impressed
but
to
return
to
simeon
this
old
man
is
a
saint
of
uncommon
simplicity
here
is
one
proof
out
of
a
thousand
several
months
ago
i
was
in
the
prior
cell
when
brother
simeon
appeared
he
made
use
of
the
ordinary
formula
in
asking
permission
to
speak
father
maximin
replied
and
on
this
word
which
permitted
him
to
speak
the
brother
showed
his
glasses
and
said
he
could
no
longer
see
clearly
is
not
very
surprising
said
the
prior
have
been
using
the
same
glasses
for
nearly
ten
years
and
since
then
your
eyes
may
well
have
become
weaker
never
mind
we
will
find
the
number
which
suits
your
sight
now
as
he
spoke
father
maximin
mechanically
moved
the
glass
of
the
spectacles
between
his
hands
and
suddenly
he
laughed
showing
me
his
fingers
which
were
black
he
turned
round
took
a
cloth
cleaned
the
spectacles
and
replacing
them
on
the
brother
nose
said
to
him
you
see
brother
simeon
and
the
old
man
astonished
cried
i
see
but
this
is
only
one
side
of
this
good
man
another
is
the
love
of
his
beasts
when
a
sow
is
going
to
bring
forth
he
asks
permission
to
pass
the
night
by
her
and
delivers
her
looking
after
her
like
his
child
weeps
when
they
sell
his
little
pigs
or
when
the
big
ones
are
sent
to
the
and
how
all
the
animals
adore
him
truly
the
oblate
went
on
after
a
silence
god
loves
simple
souls
above
all
for
he
loads
brother
simeon
with
graces
alone
here
he
can
reabsorb
and
even
prevent
the
demoniacal
accidents
which
arise
in
cloisters
then
we
assist
at
strange
performances
one
fine
morning
all
the
pigs
fall
on
their
sides
they
are
ill
and
at
the
point
of
death
simeon
who
knows
the
origin
of
these
evils
cries
to
the
devil
wait
and
you
will
see
he
runs
for
holy
water
and
sprinkles
them
with
it
praying
the
while
and
all
the
beasts
who
were
dying
jump
up
frisking
about
and
wagging
their
tails
as
for
diabolic
incursions
into
the
convent
itself
they
are
but
too
real
and
sometimes
are
only
driven
back
after
persistent
prayers
and
energetic
fastings
at
certain
times
in
most
convents
the
demon
sows
a
harvest
of
hobgoblins
of
whom
no
one
knows
how
to
get
rid
here
the
father
abbot
the
prior
and
all
those
who
are
priests
have
failed
it
was
necessary
to
give
efficacy
to
the
exorcisms
that
the
humble
lay
brother
should
intervene
so
to
forestall
new
attacks
he
has
obtained
the
right
to
wash
the
monastery
with
holy
water
and
to
use
prayers
whenever
he
thinks
well
to
do
so
he
has
the
power
of
feeling
where
the
evil
one
is
hidden
and
he
follows
him
tracks
him
and
finally
casts
him
out
here
is
the
piggery
continued
bruno
showing
a
old
place
in
front
of
the
left
wing
of
the
cloister
surrounded
by
palisades
and
he
added
i
warn
you
the
old
man
grunts
like
a
pig
but
he
will
not
answer
your
questions
except
by
signs
but
he
can
speak
to
his
animals
yes
to
them
only
the
oblate
opened
a
small
door
and
the
lay
brother
all
bent
lifted
his
head
with
difficulty
brother
said
bruno
here
is
a
gentleman
who
would
like
to
see
your
pupils
there
was
a
grunt
of
joy
on
the
lips
of
the
old
man
he
smiled
and
invited
them
by
a
sign
to
follow
him
he
introduced
them
into
a
shed
and
durtal
recoiled
deafened
by
horrible
cries
suffocated
by
the
pestilential
heat
of
the
liquid
manure
all
the
pigs
jumped
up
behind
their
barrier
and
howled
with
joy
at
the
sight
of
the
brother
peace
peace
said
the
old
man
in
a
gentle
voice
and
lifting
an
arm
over
the
paling
he
caressed
the
snouts
which
on
smelling
him
were
almost
suffocated
by
grunting
he
drew
durtal
aside
by
the
arm
and
making
him
lean
over
the
trellis
work
showed
him
an
enormous
sow
with
a
snub
nose
of
english
breed
a
monstrous
animal
surrounded
by
a
company
of
sucking
pigs
which
rushed
as
if
mad
at
her
teats
yes
my
beauty
go
my
beauty
murmured
the
old
man
stroking
her
bristles
with
his
hand
and
the
sow
looked
at
him
with
little
languishing
eyes
and
licked
his
fingers
she
ended
by
screaming
abominably
when
he
went
away
and
brother
simeon
showed
off
other
pupils
pigs
with
ears
like
the
mouth
of
a
trumpet
and
corkscrew
tails
sows
whose
stomachs
trailed
and
whose
feet
seemed
hardly
outside
their
bodies
pigs
which
sucked
ravenously
at
the
teats
larger
ones
who
delighted
in
chasing
each
other
about
and
rolled
in
the
mud
snorting
durtal
complimented
him
on
the
beasts
and
the
old
man
was
jubilant
wiping
his
face
with
his
great
hand
then
on
the
oblate
inquiring
about
the
litter
of
some
sow
he
felt
his
fingers
in
a
row
replying
to
the
observation
that
the
animals
were
very
greedy
by
stretching
his
arms
to
heaven
showing
the
empty
troughs
lifting
ends
of
wood
tearing
up
tufts
of
grass
which
he
carried
to
his
lips
grunting
as
if
he
had
his
muzzle
full
then
he
took
them
into
the
courtyard
placed
them
against
the
wall
opened
a
door
beyond
and
hid
himself
a
formidable
boar
passed
like
a
waterspout
upset
a
wheelbarrow
scattering
everything
round
him
with
a
noise
like
a
shell
bursting
then
he
broke
into
a
gallop
all
round
the
courtyard
and
ended
by
taking
a
header
into
a
sea
of
liquid
manure
he
wallowed
turned
head
over
heels
kicked
about
with
his
four
feet
in
the
air
and
got
up
black
and
disgusting
as
the
inside
of
a
chimney
after
this
he
halted
grunted
a
cheerful
note
and
wished
to
fawn
on
the
monk
who
checked
him
with
a
gesture
your
boar
is
splendid
said
durtal
and
the
lay
brother
looked
on
durtal
with
moist
eyes
as
he
rubbed
his
neck
with
his
hand
sighing
that
means
they
are
going
to
kill
him
soon
said
the
oblate
and
the
old
man
acquiesced
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
his
head
they
left
him
thanking
him
for
his
kindness
when
i
think
of
how
this
being
who
is
devoted
to
the
lowest
duties
prays
in
church
i
long
to
kneel
before
him
and
like
his
pigs
kiss
his
hands
exclaimed
durtal
after
a
silence
brother
simeon
is
an
angelic
being
replied
the
oblate
he
lives
the
unitive
life
his
soul
plunged
drowned
in
the
divine
essence
under
a
rough
exterior
an
absolutely
white
soul
a
soul
without
sin
lives
in
this
poor
body
it
is
right
that
god
should
spoil
him
as
i
have
told
you
he
has
given
him
all
power
over
the
demon
and
in
certain
cases
he
allows
him
also
the
power
of
healing
by
the
imposition
of
hands
he
has
renewed
here
the
wonderful
cures
of
the
ancient
saints
they
ceased
speaking
and
warned
by
the
bells
which
were
ringing
for
vespers
they
moved
towards
the
church
and
coming
to
himself
again
trying
to
recover
durtal
remained
astounded
monastic
life
retarded
time
how
many
weeks
had
he
been
at
la
trappe
and
how
many
days
since
had
he
approached
the
sacraments
that
was
lost
in
the
distance
ah
life
was
double
in
these
cloisters
and
yet
he
was
not
tired
of
it
he
had
bent
himself
easily
to
the
hard
rule
and
in
spite
of
the
scanty
meals
he
felt
no
sick
headaches
or
failing
he
had
never
felt
so
well
but
what
remained
was
a
feeling
of
stifling
of
restrained
sighs
this
burning
melancholy
for
hours
and
more
than
all
this
vague
anxiety
at
listening
again
within
himself
and
hearing
united
in
his
person
the
voices
of
this
trinity
god
the
devil
and
man
this
is
not
the
peace
of
the
soul
i
dreamed
of
and
it
is
even
worse
than
at
paris
he
said
to
himself
recalling
the
maddening
trial
of
the
rosary
and
yet
how
can
i
explain
it
i
am
happy
here
all
the
same
chapter
rising
somewhat
earlier
than
his
wont
durtal
went
down
to
the
chapel
the
office
of
matins
was
over
but
some
lay
brothers
amongst
whom
was
brother
simeon
were
praying
on
their
knees
on
the
ground
the
sight
of
this
holy
threw
durtal
into
a
long
train
of
thought
he
tried
in
vain
to
penetrate
into
the
sanctuary
of
that
soul
hidden
like
an
invisible
chapel
behind
the
dunghill
rampart
of
a
body
he
did
not
even
succeed
in
representing
to
himself
the
docile
and
clinging
soul
of
this
man
who
had
attained
the
highest
state
to
which
the
human
creature
can
reach
here
below
what
a
power
of
prayer
he
has
thought
he
as
he
looked
at
the
old
man
he
remembered
the
details
of
his
interview
the
evening
before
it
is
true
he
thought
that
in
this
monk
i
find
something
of
the
charm
of
that
brother
juniper
whose
surprising
simplicity
has
come
down
through
the
ages
and
he
brought
to
mind
the
adventures
of
that
franciscan
whom
his
companions
left
one
day
by
himself
in
the
convent
telling
him
to
prepare
dinner
against
their
return
juniper
reflected
what
an
amount
of
time
is
spent
in
preparing
food
the
brothers
who
take
turns
in
that
work
have
not
even
time
to
pray
and
desiring
to
lighten
the
work
of
those
who
should
succeed
him
in
the
kitchen
he
determined
to
cook
such
plentiful
dishes
that
the
community
might
dine
on
them
for
a
fortnight
he
lighted
all
the
stoves
procured
we
are
not
told
how
enormous
boilers
filled
them
with
water
threw
into
them
eggs
with
their
shells
chickens
with
their
feathers
vegetables
he
had
neglected
to
trim
and
before
a
fire
which
would
roast
an
ox
he
exerted
himself
to
pile
up
and
stir
the
ridiculous
jumble
of
his
when
the
brothers
came
home
and
sat
down
in
the
refectory
he
ran
his
face
browned
and
his
hands
burnt
and
joyously
served
up
his
stew
the
superior
asked
him
if
he
were
not
mad
while
he
remained
stupefied
that
no
one
gobbled
up
this
astonishing
mess
he
declared
in
all
humility
that
he
thought
he
was
doing
a
service
to
his
brethren
and
only
when
he
observed
that
so
much
food
would
be
wasted
did
he
weep
hot
tears
and
declare
himself
a
wretch
he
cried
that
he
was
good
for
nothing
but
to
spoil
the
property
of
almighty
god
while
the
monks
smiled
admiring
this
debauch
of
charity
and
the
excess
of
juniper
simplicity
brother
simeon
would
be
humble
enough
and
simple
enough
to
renew
again
such
splendid
jokes
thought
durtal
but
better
still
than
the
good
franciscan
he
recalls
the
memory
of
that
astonishing
saint
joseph
of
cupertino
of
whom
the
oblate
spoke
yesterday
he
who
called
himself
brother
ass
was
a
charming
and
poor
creature
so
modest
and
so
ignorant
that
he
was
turned
away
wherever
he
went
he
passed
through
life
with
open
mouth
thrusting
himself
eagerly
against
all
the
cloisters
that
repulsed
him
he
wandered
about
unable
to
perform
even
the
lowest
tasks
he
was
to
use
a
popular
expression
a
regular
and
broke
whatever
he
touched
they
ordered
him
to
go
and
fetch
water
and
he
wandered
without
understanding
absorbed
in
god
and
at
the
end
when
no
one
thought
about
it
any
more
brought
some
after
a
month
a
monastery
of
capucins
which
had
received
him
got
rid
of
him
he
went
his
way
vaguely
out
of
his
orbit
among
the
towns
stumbled
into
another
convent
where
he
employed
himself
in
taking
care
of
the
animals
whom
he
adored
and
he
rose
into
a
perpetual
ecstasy
revealing
himself
as
the
most
singular
of
wonder
workers
putting
the
demons
to
flight
and
healing
the
sick
he
was
at
once
idiotic
and
sublime
in
the
hagiography
he
stands
alone
and
seems
to
figure
there
to
furnish
a
proof
that
the
soul
is
identified
with
eternal
wisdom
rather
by
ignorance
than
by
science
he
also
loves
animals
said
durtal
to
himself
as
he
looked
at
old
simeon
and
he
too
puts
to
flight
the
evil
one
and
works
cures
by
his
sanctity
in
a
time
when
all
men
are
exclusively
haunted
by
the
thoughts
of
luxury
and
lucre
the
soul
appears
extraordinary
when
divested
of
its
bark
as
the
candid
and
naked
soul
of
this
good
monk
he
is
eighty
years
old
and
more
and
he
has
led
from
his
youth
up
the
restricted
life
of
the
trappists
he
probably
does
not
know
in
what
time
he
lives
nor
what
latitudes
he
inhabits
whether
he
is
in
america
or
in
france
for
he
has
never
read
a
newspaper
and
outside
rumours
do
not
reach
him
he
does
not
even
know
the
taste
of
flesh
meat
or
wine
he
has
no
notion
of
money
of
which
he
does
not
suspect
the
value
nor
the
appearance
he
does
not
imagine
how
a
woman
is
made
and
save
for
the
breeding
of
his
pigs
he
perhaps
can
not
even
guess
the
meaning
and
the
consequences
of
the
sin
of
the
flesh
he
lives
alone
ringed
round
by
silence
and
buried
in
the
shade
he
meditates
on
the
mortifications
of
the
fathers
in
the
desert
which
are
read
to
him
as
he
eats
and
the
frenzy
of
their
fasts
makes
him
ashamed
of
his
miserable
repast
and
he
accuses
himself
that
he
is
so
well
to
do
ah
this
father
simeon
is
innocent
he
knows
nothing
that
we
know
and
knows
that
of
which
all
others
are
ignorant
his
education
has
been
taken
in
hand
by
the
lord
himself
who
teaches
him
truths
which
we
can
not
comprehend
models
his
soul
after
heaven
infuses
himself
into
him
possesses
him
and
deifies
him
in
the
union
of
blessedness
this
puts
us
somewhat
at
a
distance
from
hypocrites
and
devout
persons
as
far
indeed
as
modern
catholicism
is
from
mysticism
for
certainly
that
religion
is
as
grovelling
on
the
ground
as
mysticism
is
high
and
that
is
true
instead
of
directing
all
our
forces
to
that
unknown
end
of
taking
our
soul
to
fashion
it
in
that
form
of
a
dove
which
the
middle
ages
gave
to
the
pyxes
instead
of
making
it
the
shrine
where
the
host
reposes
in
the
very
image
of
the
holy
spirit
the
catholic
confines
himself
to
trying
to
conceal
his
conscience
to
deceive
his
judge
by
the
fear
of
a
salutary
hell
he
acts
not
by
choice
but
by
fear
he
with
the
aid
of
his
clergy
and
the
help
of
his
imbecile
literature
and
his
feeble
press
has
made
of
religion
a
mere
fetishism
a
ridiculous
worship
composed
of
statuettes
and
alms
boxes
candles
and
he
has
materialized
the
ideal
of
love
in
inventing
an
entirely
physical
devotion
to
the
sacred
heart
what
baseness
of
conception
continued
durtal
who
had
come
out
of
the
chapel
and
was
strolling
along
the
bank
of
the
great
pond
he
looked
at
the
reeds
which
bent
like
an
harvest
still
green
under
a
puff
of
wind
then
he
half
saw
as
he
leant
forward
an
old
boat
which
bore
almost
effaced
on
its
blueish
hull
the
name
alleluia
this
bark
disappeared
under
the
tufts
of
leaves
round
which
were
twined
the
bells
of
the
convolvulus
a
symbolic
flower
since
it
widens
out
like
a
chalice
and
has
the
dead
white
of
a
wafer
the
scent
of
the
water
at
once
enticing
and
bitter
intoxicated
him
ah
he
thought
happiness
certainly
consists
in
being
restricted
to
a
place
closely
locked
a
prison
very
confined
or
a
chapel
always
open
and
he
caught
himself
up
ah
there
is
brother
anacletus
the
lay
brother
was
coming
towards
him
bending
under
a
hamper
he
passed
before
durtal
smiling
at
him
with
his
eyes
and
while
he
went
his
way
durtal
thought
this
man
is
a
true
friend
of
mine
when
i
was
suffering
so
much
before
my
confession
he
expressed
all
to
me
in
a
look
when
he
believes
me
serener
and
more
joyous
he
is
content
and
shows
it
to
me
by
a
smile
and
i
shall
never
speak
to
him
i
shall
never
thank
him
i
shall
never
even
know
who
he
is
i
shall
perhaps
never
even
see
him
again
in
leaving
this
place
i
shall
keep
a
friend
for
whom
i
too
feel
affection
yet
neither
of
us
has
even
exchanged
a
gesture
with
the
other
after
all
he
thought
does
not
this
absolute
reserve
make
our
friendship
more
perfect
it
is
stamped
in
the
eternal
distance
it
remains
mysterious
and
incomplete
and
more
certain
while
thinking
over
these
reflections
durtal
went
towards
the
chapel
where
the
office
called
him
and
thence
to
the
refectory
he
was
surprised
to
find
the
table
laid
only
for
one
what
has
happened
to
bruno
yet
i
may
as
well
wait
a
while
and
to
kill
time
he
occupied
himself
by
reading
a
printed
card
hung
upon
the
wall
it
was
a
sort
of
advertisement
which
began
thus
eternity
fellow
sinners
you
will
die
be
ye
always
ready
watch
then
pray
without
ceasing
never
forget
the
four
last
things
which
you
see
here
traced
death
the
gate
of
eternity
judgment
which
decides
eternity
hell
the
abode
of
unhappy
eternity
paradise
the
abode
of
blessed
eternity
father
etienne
interrupted
durtal
telling
him
that
bruno
had
gone
to
saint
landry
to
make
some
purchases
and
would
only
return
at
at
eight
dine
then
without
waiting
and
make
haste
or
all
your
dishes
will
be
cold
and
how
is
the
father
abbot
better
he
keeps
his
room
still
but
he
hopes
to
be
able
to
come
down
a
while
the
day
after
and
assist
at
least
at
some
of
the
offices
and
the
monk
bowed
and
disappeared
durtal
seated
himself
at
table
ate
some
bean
broth
swallowed
a
egg
and
a
spoonful
of
warm
beans
then
once
outside
he
passed
along
the
chapel
entered
it
and
knelt
before
the
altar
of
the
virgin
but
at
once
the
spirit
of
blasphemy
filled
him
he
wished
whatever
it
cost
him
to
insult
the
virgin
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
experience
a
sharp
joy
an
acute
pleasure
in
soiling
her
but
he
restrained
himself
he
wrinkled
his
face
not
to
allow
the
abuse
which
was
on
his
lips
to
escape
and
he
detested
these
abominations
he
revolted
against
them
strove
against
them
with
horror
and
the
impulse
became
so
irresistible
that
in
order
to
keep
silence
he
was
obliged
to
bite
his
lips
till
they
bled
this
is
somewhat
strong
he
said
to
hear
grumbling
in
oneself
the
contrary
of
what
one
is
thinking
but
he
had
need
to
call
to
his
help
all
his
will
he
felt
that
he
should
yield
and
spit
out
all
these
impurities
wherefore
he
fled
thinking
that
should
he
find
no
means
of
resistance
it
were
better
to
vomit
this
filth
in
the
court
rather
than
in
the
church
and
so
soon
as
he
quitted
the
chapel
this
madness
of
blasphemy
ceased
he
walked
along
the
pond
astonished
by
the
strange
violence
of
the
attack
little
by
little
there
came
to
him
the
unexplained
intuition
of
a
danger
that
menaced
him
as
a
beast
that
scents
a
hidden
enemy
he
looked
with
precaution
within
himself
and
ended
by
seeing
a
black
point
on
the
horizon
of
his
soul
and
suddenly
before
he
had
time
to
reconnoitre
and
take
account
of
the
danger
he
saw
arising
this
point
extended
and
covered
him
with
its
shadow
there
was
no
more
light
in
him
he
had
that
minute
of
unrest
which
precedes
the
storm
and
in
the
anxious
silence
of
his
being
arguments
fell
like
drops
of
rain
the
painful
effects
of
the
sacrament
justified
themselves
had
he
not
proceeded
in
such
a
way
that
his
communion
could
not
but
be
unfaithful
evidently
instead
of
collecting
and
straining
himself
he
had
passed
an
afternoon
of
revolt
and
anger
the
very
evening
before
he
had
unworthily
judged
an
ecclesiastic
whose
only
wrong
was
that
he
took
pleasure
in
the
vanity
of
easy
jokes
had
he
confessed
this
injustice
and
these
revolts
not
the
least
in
the
world
and
after
the
communion
still
less
had
he
as
he
should
have
done
shut
himself
up
alone
with
his
guest
he
had
abandoned
him
without
thinking
more
of
him
had
quitted
his
innermost
cell
had
taken
a
walk
in
the
wood
had
not
even
been
present
at
the
offices
but
come
come
this
blame
is
foolish
i
communicated
just
as
i
was
on
the
formal
order
of
the
confessor
as
for
the
walk
i
did
not
ask
for
it
nor
wish
for
it
bruno
in
agreement
with
the
abbot
of
la
trappe
decided
it
would
do
me
good
i
have
then
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
i
am
blameless
this
does
not
prove
that
you
would
not
have
done
better
to
spend
the
day
in
prayer
in
the
church
but
he
cried
with
such
a
system
one
could
not
move
one
could
not
eat
nor
sleep
for
one
should
never
leave
the
church
there
must
be
time
for
everything
or
the
devil
take
it
all
no
doubt
but
a
more
diligent
soul
would
have
refused
that
excursion
just
because
it
was
pleasant
would
have
avoided
it
out
of
mortification
in
a
spirit
of
penance
evidently
but
these
scruples
tortured
him
the
fact
is
he
said
i
might
have
employed
my
afternoon
more
wholesomely
than
that
to
believe
that
he
had
spent
it
ill
was
but
a
step
and
he
made
it
he
pelted
himself
for
an
hour
sweating
with
agony
heaping
on
himself
imaginary
sins
and
entering
so
far
on
that
road
that
he
ended
by
suddenly
realizing
his
position
and
understanding
he
was
out
of
the
right
track
the
story
of
the
rosary
returned
to
his
memory
and
then
he
blamed
himself
for
allowing
himself
to
be
again
driven
into
a
corner
by
the
demon
he
began
to
breathe
again
to
regain
his
footing
when
other
attacks
equally
formidable
presented
themselves
it
was
no
longer
an
insinuation
of
arguments
which
ran
drop
by
drop
but
a
furious
rain
which
threw
itself
like
an
avalanche
on
his
soul
the
storm
of
which
the
wave
of
scruples
was
only
the
prelude
burst
in
its
fulness
and
in
the
panic
of
the
first
moment
in
the
violence
of
the
tempest
the
enemy
unmasked
his
batteries
and
struck
him
to
the
heart
he
had
got
no
good
from
that
communion
but
he
was
also
too
young
at
it
ah
indeed
was
he
to
believe
that
because
a
priest
uttered
five
latin
words
over
a
bit
of
unleavened
bread
that
bread
was
transubstantiated
into
the
flesh
of
christ
that
a
child
should
accept
such
nonsense
might
be
possible
but
that
a
man
past
forty
should
listen
to
such
formidable
shams
was
excessive
almost
disquieting
and
these
insinuations
lashed
him
like
hail
showers
how
could
bread
made
of
wheat
before
have
only
the
appearance
of
wheat
afterwards
what
is
flesh
that
is
neither
seen
nor
felt
what
is
a
body
which
has
such
ubiquity
as
to
be
at
the
same
time
on
the
altars
of
divers
countries
what
is
that
power
which
is
annihilated
when
the
host
is
not
made
of
pure
wheat
and
this
became
a
regular
deluge
which
overwhelmed
him
and
yet
like
an
impenetrable
pile
that
faith
he
had
acquired
without
ever
having
known
how
remained
immovable
disappeared
under
torrents
of
interrogation
but
never
stirred
he
revolted
and
said
to
himself
this
only
proves
that
the
sacramental
darkness
of
the
eucharist
can
not
be
sounded
moreover
if
it
were
intelligible
it
would
not
be
divine
if
the
god
whom
we
serve
could
be
comprehended
by
reason
he
could
not
be
worth
the
trouble
of
serving
said
tauler
and
the
declares
plainly
also
at
the
end
of
the
ivth
book
that
if
the
works
of
god
were
such
as
man
intelligence
could
easily
grasp
they
would
cease
to
be
marvellous
and
could
not
be
qualified
as
ineffable
and
a
mocking
voice
replied
that
is
what
you
call
answering
avowing
that
there
is
nothing
to
answer
in
fact
said
durtal
who
reflected
i
have
been
present
at
spiritualistic
experiences
where
no
trickery
was
possible
it
was
quite
evident
that
there
was
no
fluid
from
the
spectators
no
suggestion
of
persons
surrounding
the
table
who
dictated
the
responses
then
in
giving
its
raps
the
table
expressed
itself
suddenly
in
english
though
no
one
spoke
that
language
then
a
few
minutes
later
addressing
itself
to
me
who
was
at
a
distance
from
it
and
consequently
was
not
touching
it
it
told
me
this
time
in
french
facts
which
i
had
forgotten
and
i
alone
could
know
i
am
then
certainly
obliged
to
suppose
an
element
of
the
supernatural
using
a
table
in
guise
of
an
interpreter
to
accept
if
not
the
evocation
of
the
dead
but
at
least
the
proved
existence
of
ghosts
then
it
is
not
more
impossible
more
surprising
that
christ
should
substitute
himself
for
a
piece
of
bread
than
that
a
ghost
should
hide
and
brag
in
the
foot
of
a
table
these
phenomena
equally
put
our
senses
to
rout
but
if
one
of
them
be
undeniable
and
spiritualistic
manifestation
certainly
is
so
what
motives
can
we
invoke
to
deny
the
other
which
is
moreover
attested
by
thousands
of
saints
after
all
he
went
on
with
a
smile
we
have
already
demonstration
by
the
absurd
but
this
may
be
called
demonstration
by
the
abject
for
if
the
eucharistic
mystery
is
sublime
it
is
not
the
same
with
spiritualism
which
is
after
all
only
the
latrine
of
the
supernatural
if
this
were
the
only
enigma
began
the
voice
again
but
all
the
catholic
doctrines
are
on
the
same
model
examine
religion
from
its
birth
and
see
if
it
do
not
always
issue
by
an
absurd
dogma
here
is
a
god
infinitely
perfect
infinitely
good
a
god
who
is
not
ignorant
of
past
present
or
future
he
knew
then
that
eve
would
sin
therefore
of
two
things
one
either
he
is
not
good
in
that
he
submitted
her
to
that
proof
knowing
that
she
had
not
power
to
stand
it
or
again
he
was
not
certain
of
her
defeat
in
that
case
he
is
not
omniscient
he
is
not
perfect
durtal
gave
no
answer
to
this
dilemma
which
is
in
fact
difficult
to
resolve
yet
he
thought
we
may
at
once
exclude
one
of
these
two
propositions
the
latter
for
it
is
childish
to
concern
ourselves
about
the
future
when
we
have
to
do
with
god
we
judge
him
by
our
miserable
understanding
and
there
is
for
him
neither
present
nor
past
nor
future
he
sees
them
all
at
the
same
moment
in
light
uncreate
for
him
distance
has
no
figure
and
space
is
nought
it
is
consequently
impossible
to
doubt
that
the
serpent
will
conquer
this
amputated
dilemma
is
then
out
of
order
be
it
so
but
the
other
alternative
remains
what
do
you
make
of
his
goodness
his
goodness
and
durtal
had
need
to
repeat
again
the
arguments
drawn
from
free
will
and
the
promised
coming
of
the
saviour
and
he
was
obliged
to
admit
that
these
answers
were
weak
and
the
voice
became
more
pressing
then
you
admit
original
sin
i
am
obliged
to
admit
it
because
it
exists
what
are
heredity
and
atavism
save
under
another
name
the
terrible
sin
of
the
beginning
and
does
it
appear
to
you
just
that
innocent
generations
should
make
amends
now
and
always
for
the
sin
of
the
first
man
and
as
durtal
did
not
reply
the
voice
insinuated
gently
this
law
is
so
iniquitous
that
it
seems
as
if
the
creator
were
ashamed
of
it
and
that
in
order
to
punish
himself
for
his
ferocity
and
not
to
make
himself
for
ever
execrated
by
his
creature
he
wished
to
suffer
on
the
cross
and
expiate
his
crime
in
the
person
of
his
own
son
but
cried
durtal
exasperated
god
could
not
commit
a
crime
and
punish
himself
were
that
so
jesus
would
be
the
redeemer
of
his
father
and
not
ours
it
is
madness
little
by
little
he
recovered
his
balance
he
recited
slowly
the
apostles
creed
while
the
objections
which
demolished
it
pressed
one
after
the
other
within
him
there
is
one
fact
certain
he
said
to
himself
for
in
all
this
tumult
he
was
perfectly
lucid
that
for
the
moment
we
are
two
persons
in
one
i
can
follow
my
reasonings
and
i
hear
on
the
other
side
the
sophisms
my
double
breathes
in
me
this
duality
has
never
appeared
so
clear
to
me
and
the
attack
grew
feebler
on
this
reflection
it
might
have
been
believed
that
the
enemy
now
discovered
was
beating
a
retreat
but
nothing
of
the
kind
after
a
short
truce
the
assault
began
again
on
another
point
are
you
very
sure
that
you
have
not
suggested
and
shown
the
blow
to
yourself
by
having
wished
you
have
ended
by
begetting
belief
and
by
implanting
in
yourself
a
fixed
idea
disguised
under
the
name
of
grace
round
which
everything
now
clings
you
complain
that
you
did
not
experience
sensible
joys
after
your
communion
this
simply
proves
that
you
were
not
careful
enough
or
that
tired
by
the
excess
of
the
evening
before
your
imagination
showed
itself
unready
to
play
the
infatuating
fairy
story
you
expected
from
yourself
after
the
mass
moreover
you
ought
to
know
that
in
these
questions
all
depends
on
the
more
or
less
feverish
activity
of
the
brain
and
the
senses
see
what
takes
place
in
the
case
of
women
who
deceive
themselves
more
easily
than
men
for
that
again
declares
the
difference
of
conformations
the
variety
between
the
sexes
christ
gives
himself
carnally
under
the
appearances
of
bread
that
is
mystical
marriage
the
divine
union
consummated
by
the
way
of
the
lips
he
is
indeed
the
spouse
of
women
while
we
men
without
willing
it
by
the
very
lodestone
of
our
nature
are
more
attracted
by
the
virgin
but
she
does
not
give
herself
like
her
son
to
us
she
does
not
reside
in
the
sacrament
possession
is
in
her
case
impossible
she
is
our
mother
but
she
is
not
our
spouse
as
he
is
the
spouse
of
virgins
we
conceive
therefore
that
women
are
more
violently
duped
that
they
adore
better
and
imagine
more
easily
the
more
they
are
petted
moreover
bruno
said
to
you
yesterday
is
more
passive
less
rebellious
to
the
action
of
heaven
well
what
has
that
to
do
with
me
what
does
that
prove
that
the
more
we
love
the
better
we
are
loved
but
if
that
axiom
is
false
from
the
earthly
point
of
view
it
is
certainly
exact
from
the
divine
point
of
view
which
would
be
monstrous
and
would
come
to
this
that
the
lord
would
not
treat
the
soul
of
a
poor
clare
better
than
mine
there
was
again
a
time
of
rest
and
the
attack
turned
and
rushed
on
a
new
place
then
you
believe
in
an
eternal
hell
you
suppose
a
god
more
cruel
than
yourself
a
god
who
has
created
people
without
their
having
been
consulted
without
their
having
asked
to
be
born
and
after
having
suffered
during
their
existence
they
will
be
again
punished
without
mercy
after
their
death
but
consider
if
you
were
to
see
your
worst
enemy
in
torture
you
would
be
taken
by
pity
and
would
ask
pardon
for
him
you
would
pardon
and
the
almighty
be
implacable
you
will
admit
this
is
to
have
a
singular
idea
of
him
durtal
was
silent
hell
going
on
infinitely
became
in
fact
wearisome
the
reply
that
it
is
legitimate
that
punishment
should
be
infinite
because
rewards
are
so
was
not
decisive
since
indeed
it
were
the
property
of
perfect
goodness
to
abridge
the
chastisements
and
prolong
the
joys
but
in
fact
he
said
to
himself
saint
catherine
of
genoa
has
elucidated
the
question
she
explains
very
well
that
god
sends
a
ray
of
mercy
a
current
of
pity
into
hell
that
no
damned
soul
suffers
as
much
as
it
deserves
to
suffer
that
if
expiation
ought
not
to
cease
it
may
be
modified
and
weakened
and
become
at
length
less
rigorous
less
intense
she
remarks
also
that
at
the
moment
of
its
separation
from
the
body
the
soul
becomes
obstinate
or
yields
if
it
remain
hardened
and
shows
no
contrition
for
its
faults
its
guilt
can
not
be
remitted
since
after
death
free
will
subsists
no
more
the
will
which
we
possess
at
the
moment
of
quitting
the
world
remains
invariable
if
on
the
contrary
it
does
not
persist
in
those
impenitent
sentiments
a
part
of
the
repression
will
no
doubt
be
removed
and
consequently
is
not
devoted
to
a
continual
gehenna
as
that
which
deliberately
while
there
is
yet
time
will
not
return
to
amendment
refuses
in
fact
to
lay
aside
its
sins
let
us
add
that
according
to
the
saint
god
does
not
even
make
the
soul
empty
to
be
never
polluted
by
sin
for
it
goes
there
of
itself
it
is
led
there
by
the
very
nature
of
its
sins
it
flings
itself
in
as
into
its
own
good
is
if
one
may
say
so
naturally
engulfed
there
in
fact
we
may
imagine
to
ourselves
a
very
small
hell
and
a
very
large
purgatory
may
imagine
that
hell
is
scantily
peopled
is
only
reserved
for
cases
of
rare
wickedness
that
in
reality
the
crowd
of
disincarnate
souls
presses
into
purgatory
and
there
endures
punishments
proportioned
to
the
misdeeds
it
has
willed
here
below
these
ideas
have
nothing
which
can
not
be
sustained
and
they
have
the
advantage
of
being
in
accord
with
the
ideas
of
mercy
and
justice
exactly
replied
the
voice
in
railing
tones
man
then
will
do
well
to
constrain
himself
he
may
steal
rob
kill
his
father
and
violate
his
daughter
the
price
is
the
same
provided
he
repent
at
the
last
minute
he
is
saved
but
no
contrition
takes
away
the
eternity
of
punishment
only
and
not
punishment
itself
everyone
must
be
punished
or
rewarded
according
to
his
works
he
who
will
be
soiled
by
a
parricide
or
an
incest
will
bear
a
chastisement
different
in
pain
and
length
to
him
who
has
not
committed
them
equality
in
expiatory
suffering
in
reparative
pain
does
not
exist
moreover
this
idea
of
a
purgative
life
after
death
is
so
natural
so
certain
that
all
religions
assume
it
all
consider
the
soul
is
a
sort
of
air
balloon
which
can
not
mount
and
attain
its
last
end
in
space
except
by
throwing
away
its
ballast
in
the
religions
of
the
east
the
soul
is
in
order
to
purify
itself
it
rubs
itself
against
a
new
body
like
a
blade
in
sandstone
troughs
to
brighten
it
for
us
catholics
it
undergoes
no
terrestrial
avatar
but
it
lightens
and
scours
itself
clears
itself
in
the
purgatory
where
god
transforms
it
draws
it
out
extracts
it
little
by
little
from
the
dross
of
its
sins
till
it
can
raise
itself
and
lose
itself
in
him
to
have
done
with
this
irritating
question
of
a
perpetual
hell
why
not
conceive
that
divine
justice
hesitates
in
the
majority
of
cases
to
pronounce
inexorable
decrees
humanity
is
for
the
most
part
composed
of
unconscious
rascals
and
fools
who
do
not
take
any
count
of
the
reach
of
their
faults
these
are
saved
by
their
complete
want
of
comprehension
as
for
others
who
rot
knowing
what
they
do
they
are
evidently
more
blameworthy
but
society
which
hates
superior
beings
takes
on
itself
their
punishment
humiliates
and
persecutes
them
and
it
is
therefore
allowed
us
to
hope
that
our
lord
will
pity
these
poor
souls
so
miserably
pelted
during
their
stay
upon
earth
by
a
horde
of
fools
then
there
is
every
advantage
in
being
imbecile
since
one
is
spared
both
on
earth
and
in
heaven
ah
certainly
and
yet
and
yet
what
is
the
good
of
discussion
since
we
can
not
frame
for
ourselves
the
least
idea
of
the
infinite
justice
of
a
god
moreover
this
is
enough
these
debates
overwhelm
me
he
tried
to
distract
his
thoughts
from
these
subjects
and
would
feign
to
break
the
obsession
betake
himself
to
paris
but
five
minutes
had
not
passed
before
his
double
returned
to
the
charge
he
entered
once
more
on
that
halting
dilemma
which
had
so
recently
assailed
the
goodness
of
the
creator
in
regard
to
the
sins
of
man
purgatory
is
then
exorbitant
for
after
all
said
he
god
knew
that
man
would
yield
to
temptations
then
why
allow
them
and
above
all
why
condemn
them
is
that
goodness
is
that
justice
but
it
is
a
sophism
cried
durtal
growing
angry
god
has
left
to
every
man
his
liberty
no
one
is
tempted
beyond
his
power
if
in
certain
cases
he
allows
the
seduction
to
overpass
our
means
of
resistance
it
is
to
recall
us
to
humility
to
bring
us
back
to
him
by
remorse
for
other
causes
which
we
know
not
which
it
is
not
his
business
to
show
us
then
probably
those
transgressions
are
appreciated
in
a
different
way
to
those
which
we
have
practised
with
our
full
accord
the
liberty
of
man
it
is
a
pretty
thing
yes
let
us
speak
of
it
and
atavism
and
our
surroundings
and
diseases
of
the
brain
and
of
the
marrow
is
a
man
driven
by
the
impulses
of
sickness
overwhelmed
by
troubles
of
the
generative
organs
responsible
for
his
acts
but
what
can
be
said
if
under
these
conditions
these
acts
are
imputed
to
him
on
high
it
is
after
all
idiotic
always
to
compare
divine
justice
to
man
tribunals
for
it
is
exactly
the
contrary
human
judgments
are
often
so
infamous
that
they
attest
the
existence
of
another
equity
rather
than
the
proofs
of
a
theodicy
the
magistrature
proves
god
for
without
him
how
can
be
satisfied
that
instinct
of
justice
so
innate
in
each
of
us
that
even
the
humblest
beast
possesses
it
yet
replied
the
voice
all
this
does
not
hinder
the
change
of
character
according
as
the

when

at

durtal
recovered
himself
the
material
arguments
were
but
little
disquieting
for
none
could
remain
standing
all
confounded
the
function
and
the
organ
the
lodger
and
the
lodging
the
clock
and
the
hour
their
assertions
rested
on
no
base
to
liken
the
happy
lucidity
and
unequalled
genius
of
a
saint
teresa
to
the
extravagances
of
nymphomaniacs
and
other
mad
women
were
so
obtuse
so
clumsy
that
it
could
only
raise
a
smile
the
mystery
would
remain
complete
no
doctor
has
been
able
to
discover
or
could
discover
the
psyche
in
those
round
or
fusiform
cells
in
the
white
matter
or
grey
substance
of
the
brain
they
would
recognize
more
or
less
justly
the
organs
which
the
soul
uses
to
pull
the
strings
of
the
puppet
which
it
is
condemned
to
move
but
itself
remains
invisible
it
has
gone
when
after
death
they
force
open
the
rooms
of
its
habitation
no
these
newsmongers
have
no
effect
on
me
durtal
assured
himself
but
does
this
one
do
any
better
do
you
believe
in
the
utility
of
life
in
the
necessity
of
this
endless
chain
this
towage
of
sufferings
to
be
prolonged
for
the
most
part
after
death
true
goodness
would
have
consisted
in
inventing
nothing
creating
nothing
in
leaving
all
as
it
was
in
nothingness
in
peace
the
attack
turned
round
on
itself
and
after
apparent
variations
returned
always
to
the
same
starting
point
durtal
lowered
his
head
for
this
argument
dismasted
him
all
the
replies
which
could
be
imagined
were
remarkably
weak
and
the
least
feeble
that
which
consists
in
denying
to
ourselves
the
right
to
judge
because
we
only
see
the
details
of
the
divine
plan
because
we
can
possess
no
general
view
of
it
can
not
avail
against
that
terrible
phrase
of
schopenhauer
if
god
made
the
world
i
would
not
be
that
god
for
the
misery
of
the
world
would
break
my
heart
there
is
no
haggling
in
the
matter
he
said
to
himself
i
can
quite
understand
that
sorrow
is
the
true
disinfectant
of
souls
yet
i
am
obliged
to
ask
myself
why
the
creator
has
not
invented
a
less
atrocious
way
of
purifying
us
ah
when
i
think
of
the
sufferings
shut
up
in
madhouses
and
hospital
wards
i
am
revolted
and
inclined
to
doubt
everything
if
again
grief
were
an
antiseptic
for
future
misdeeds
or
a
detersive
for
past
faults
one
might
again
understand
but
now
it
falls
indifferently
on
the
bad
and
on
the
good
it
is
blind
the
best
proof
is
the
virgin
who
was
without
spot
and
who
had
not
like
her
son
to
expiate
for
us
she
consequently
ought
not
to
be
punished
yet
she
too
underwent
at
the
foot
of
calvary
the
punishment
exacted
by
this
horrible
law
good
but
then
replied
durtal
after
a
silence
of
reflection
if
the
innocent
virgin
has
given
us
an
example
by
what
right
do
we
who
are
culpable
dare
to
complain
no
we
must
therefore
resolve
to
dwell
in
darkness
to
live
surrounded
by
enigmas
money
love
nothing
is
clear
chance
if
it
exist
is
as
mysterious
as
providence
and
indeed
still
more
so
it
is
inexplicable
god
is
at
least
an
origin
of
the
unknown
a
key
an
origin
which
is
itself
another
secret
a
key
which
opens
nothing
ah
it
is
irritating
he
said
to
himself
to
be
thus
harassed
in
every
sense
enough
of
it
besides
these
are
questions
which
a
theologian
is
alone
able
to
discuss
i
am
unarmed
the
game
is
not
equal
i
will
not
answer
any
more
and
he
could
not
but
hear
a
vague
laughter
which
arose
in
him
he
quitted
the
garden
and
directed
his
steps
towards
the
chapel
but
the
fear
of
being
seized
again
by
the
madness
of
blasphemy
turned
him
away
from
it
knowing
not
whither
to
go
he
regained
his
cell
saying
to
himself
that
he
ought
not
to
wrangle
thus
yes
but
how
could
he
help
hearing
the
cavils
which
rose
he
knew
not
whence
he
almost
shouted
aloud
be
silent
let
the
other
speak
when
he
was
in
his
chamber
he
desired
to
pray
and
fell
on
his
knees
at
his
bedside
this
was
abominable
for
memories
of
florence
recurred
to
him
he
rose
but
the
old
aberrations
returned
he
thought
of
that
creature
her
strange
tastes
her
mania
for
biting
his
ears
for
drinking
toilet
scents
in
little
glasses
for
nibbling
bread
and
butter
with
caviare
and
dates
she
was
so
wild
and
so
strange
a
fool
no
doubt
but
obscure
and
if
she
were
in
this
room
before
you
what
would
you
do
he
stammered
to
himself
i
would
try
not
to
yield
you
lie
admit
then
that
you
would
send
your
conversion
the
monastery
all
to
the
devil
he
grew
pale
at
the
thought
the
possibility
of
his
cowardice
was
a
punishment
to
have
communicated
when
one
was
no
more
certain
of
the
future
no
more
certain
of
oneself
was
almost
a
sacrilege
he
thought
and
he
became
angry
up
till
now
he
had
kept
right
but
the
vision
of
florence
subdued
him
he
threw
himself
in
desperation
on
a
chair
no
longer
knowing
what
would
become
of
him
gathering
what
of
courage
remained
to
him
to
descend
to
the
church
where
the
office
was
beginning
he
dragged
himself
there
and
held
himself
down
assailed
by
filthy
temptations
disgusted
with
himself
feeling
his
will
yielding
wounded
in
every
part
and
when
he
was
in
the
court
he
remained
overwhelmed
asking
himself
where
he
could
take
shelter
every
place
had
become
hostile
to
him
in
his
cell
were
carnal
memories
outside
were
temptations
against
faith
or
rather
he
cried
i
carry
these
with
me
always
my
god
my
god
i
was
yesterday
so
tranquil
he
strolled
by
chance
into
an
alley
when
a
new
phenomenon
arose
he
had
had
up
to
this
hour
in
the
sky
within
him
a
rain
of
scruples
a
tempest
of
doubts
a
thunderstroke
of
lust
now
was
silence
and
death
complete
darkness
was
within
him
he
sought
his
soul
by
groping
for
it
and
found
it
inert
without
consciousness
almost
icy
he
had
a
body
living
and
healthy
all
his
intelligence
all
his
reason
and
his
other
powers
his
other
faculties
were
benumbed
little
by
little
and
stopped
in
his
being
there
was
manifested
an
effect
at
once
analogous
and
contrary
to
that
which
curara
produces
on
the
organism
when
it
circulates
in
the
network
of
the
blood
the
members
are
paralyzed
no
pain
is
experienced
but
cold
rises
the
soul
ends
by
being
sequestered
alive
in
a
corpse
in
this
case
it
was
the
living
body
that
detained
a
dead
soul
harassed
by
fear
he
disengaged
himself
with
a
supreme
effort
he
would
make
a
visit
to
himself
see
where
he
was
and
like
a
sailor
who
descends
into
the
hold
in
a
ship
that
has
sprung
a
leak
he
had
to
step
backwards
for
the
gangway
was
cut
the
steps
opened
upon
an
abyss
in
spite
of
the
terror
which
rushed
upon
him
he
hung
fascinated
over
the
hole
and
by
fixing
the
black
point
he
distinguished
appearances
in
a
light
as
of
eclipse
in
rarefied
air
he
perceived
at
the
basis
of
himself
the
panorama
of
his
soul
a
desert
twilight
on
the
horizons
that
approached
the
night
and
under
this
doubtful
light
there
seemed
something
like
bare
fields
a
marsh
heaped
with
rubbish
and
cinders
the
place
of
the
sins
torn
up
by
the
confessor
remained
visible
but
besides
the
dry
darnel
of
dead
vices
which
grew
still
nothing
budded
he
saw
himself
exhausted
he
knew
that
he
had
no
further
force
to
extirpate
the
last
roots
and
he
fancied
that
he
had
again
to
sow
the
seed
of
virtues
to
till
this
arid
soil
manure
this
dead
ground
he
felt
himself
incapable
of
all
work
and
had
at
the
same
time
the
conviction
that
god
rejected
him
that
god
would
aid
him
no
more
this
certainty
tore
him
to
pieces
it
could
not
be
expressed
for
nothing
could
translate
the
anxiety
the
anguish
of
a
state
through
which
he
must
have
passed
who
could
understand
it
the
terror
of
a
child
who
has
never
left
its
mother
petticoats
and
who
is
deserted
without
warning
in
the
open
country
in
a
fog
could
only
give
a
vestige
of
an
idea
of
it
and
again
by
reason
of
his
age
the
child
after
having
felt
desolate
would
end
by
growing
calmer
by
distracting
himself
from
his
grief
no
longer
seeing
the
danger
which
surrounds
him
while
in
this
state
is
danger
clinging
and
absolute
the
immovable
thought
of
abandonment
obstinate
fear
which
nothing
diminishes
nothing
appeases
one
dare
not
advance
nor
retreat
rather
cast
oneself
on
the
ground
with
bowed
head
and
wait
the
end
of
what
we
know
not
and
be
assured
that
the
menaces
we
ignore
and
those
at
which
we
guess
are
removed
durtal
was
at
this
point
he
could
not
return
on
his
steps
for
the
way
he
had
quitted
horrified
him
he
would
rather
have
died
than
return
to
paris
there
to
begin
again
his
carnal
experiences
to
live
again
his
hours
of
libertinage
and
lassitude
but
if
he
could
not
again
retrace
his
road
neither
could
he
advance
for
the
road
ended
in
a
blind
alley
if
earth
repulsed
him
heaven
at
the
same
time
was
closed
for
him
he
was
lying
half
on
his
side
in
the
darkness
in
the
shade
he
knew
not
where
and
this
state
was
aggravated
by
an
absolute
failure
to
understand
the
causes
which
brought
him
there
was
exaggerated
by
the
memory
of
graces
before
received
durtal
remembered
the
sweetness
of
the
beginning
the
caress
of
the
divine
touches
the
steady
progress
without
obstacles
the
encounter
with
a
solitary
priest
his
being
sent
to
la
trappe
the
very
ease
with
which
he
bent
to
the
monastic
life
the
absolution
which
had
such
truly
sensible
effects
the
rapid
and
clear
answer
that
he
might
communicate
without
fear
and
suddenly
without
his
will
he
had
in
fact
failed
he
who
had
till
then
held
him
by
the
hand
refused
to
guide
him
cast
him
off
into
the
darkness
without
a
word
all
is
over
he
thought
i
am
condemned
to
float
here
below
like
a
waif
which
no
one
wants
no
shore
is
henceforward
accessible
for
if
the
world
refuses
me
i
disgust
god
ah
lord
remember
the
garden
of
gethsemani
the
tragic
defection
of
the
father
whom
thou
didst
implore
in
unspeakable
pangs
in
the
silence
which
received
his
cry
he
gave
way
and
yet
he
desired
to
react
against
this
desolation
endeavoured
to
escape
from
his
despair
he
prayed
and
had
again
that
very
precise
sensation
that
his
petitions
did
not
carry
were
not
even
heard
he
called
her
who
superintends
allegiance
the
mediatrix
of
pardon
to
his
aid
and
he
was
persuaded
that
the
virgin
heard
him
no
longer
he
was
silent
and
discouraged
while
the
shade
grew
still
more
dense
and
complete
darkness
covered
him
he
did
not
then
suffer
any
longer
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
but
it
was
worse
for
this
was
annihilation
in
the
void
the
giddiness
of
a
man
who
is
bent
over
a
gulf
and
the
scraps
of
reasoning
which
he
could
gather
and
knit
together
in
this
breaking
up
ended
by
branching
out
into
scruples
he
sought
for
any
sins
which
since
his
communion
might
justify
such
a
trial
and
he
could
not
find
them
he
even
tried
to
magnify
his
small
faults
enlarge
his
want
of
patience
he
wished
to
convince
himself
that
he
had
taken
a
certain
pleasure
in
finding
the
image
of
florence
in
his
cell
and
he
tortured
himself
so
violently
that
he
reanimated
the
soul
which
had
half
fainted
by
these
moxas
and
placed
it
again
without
wishing
it
in
that
acute
state
of
scruples
in
which
it
was
when
the
crisis
declared
itself
and
in
these
brawling
reflections
he
did
not
lose
the
sad
faculty
of
analysis
he
said
to
himself
while
gauging
himself
at
a
glance
i
am
like
the
litter
in
a
circus
trodden
down
by
all
the
sorrows
which
go
and
come
to
play
their
parts
doubts
about
faith
which
seemed
to
stretch
into
every
sense
turned
in
fact
in
the
same
circle
and
now
scruples
from
which
i
thought
myself
freed
reappear
and
course
through
me
how
should
he
explain
this
was
he
who
inflicted
this
torture
on
him
the
spirit
of
malice
or
god
that
he
had
been
bruised
by
the
evil
one
was
certain
the
very
nature
of
his
attacks
showed
his
handiwork
but
how
could
this
abandonment
of
god
be
explained
for
in
fact
the
demon
could
not
prevent
the
saviour
from
assisting
him
and
he
was
quite
obliged
to
conclude
that
if
he
were
martyrized
by
the
one
the
other
took
no
interest
in
him
let
him
be
and
retired
from
him
completely
this
certainty
deduced
from
precise
observations
this
reasoned
assurance
finished
him
he
cried
out
from
the
anguish
of
it
looking
at
the
pond
by
which
he
was
walking
wishing
he
might
fall
in
thinking
that
death
by
drowning
were
preferable
to
such
a
life
then
he
trembled
before
the
water
which
attracted
him
and
carried
away
his
sorrows
to
the
charm
of
the
woods
he
tried
to
wear
himself
out
by
long
walking
but
he
wearied
himself
without
effect
and
he
ended
by
sinking
down
worn
and
broken
at
the
refectory
table
he
looked
at
his
plate
with
no
courage
to
eat
no
desire
to
drink
he
breathed
hard
and
exhausted
as
he
was
could
not
keep
in
one
place
he
rose
and
wandered
in
the
court
till
compline
and
there
in
the
chapel
where
at
least
he
hoped
to
find
some
solace
was
the
crowning
point
of
all
the
mine
went
off
the
soul
sapped
since
the
morning
exploded
on
his
knees
desolate
he
tried
again
to
invoke
help
and
nothing
came
he
choked
immured
in
so
deep
a
trench
under
a
vault
so
thick
that
every
appeal
was
stifled
and
no
sound
vibrated
without
courage
he
wept
with
his
head
in
his
hands
and
while
he
complained
to
god
that
he
had
brought
him
thither
to
punish
him
in
a
trappist
monastery
ignoble
visions
assailed
him
fluids
passed
before
his
face
and
peopled
the
space
with
priapisms
he
did
not
see
them
with
the
eyes
of
his
body
which
were
in
no
degree
hallucinated
but
perceived
them
outside
him
and
felt
them
within
him
in
a
word
the
touch
was
external
and
the
vision
internal
he
tried
to
gaze
on
the
statue
of
saint
joseph
before
which
he
kept
himself
and
to
see
nothing
but
it
but
his
eyes
seemed
to
revolve
to
see
only
within
and
were
filled
with
indecencies
it
was
a
medley
of
apparitions
with
undecided
outlines
and
confused
colours
which
gained
precision
only
in
those
parts
coveted
by
the
secular
infamy
of
man
and
this
changed
again
the
human
forms
vanished
there
remained
only
in
invisible
landscapes
of
flesh
marshes
reddened
by
the
fires
of
what
sunset
it
was
impossible
to
say
marshes
shuddering
under
the
divided
shelter
of
the
grasses
then
the
sensual
spot
grew
smaller
still
but
remained
and
this
time
did
not
move
it
was
the
growth
of
an
unclean
flood
the
spreading
of
the
daisy
of
darkness
the
unfolding
of
the
lotos
of
the
caverns
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
there
burning
gasps
excited
durtal
enwrapped
him
stifled
him
with
furious
gasps
which
drank
his
mouth
he
looked
in
spite
of
himself
unable
to
withdraw
himself
from
the
outrages
imposed
by
these
violations
but
the
body
was
still
and
remained
calm
while
the
soul
revolted
with
a
groan
the
temptation
was
then
of
no
effect
but
if
the
tricks
only
succeeded
in
suggesting
to
him
disgust
and
horror
they
made
him
suffer
beyond
measure
while
they
delayed
all
the
days
of
his
shameful
existence
came
to
the
surface
all
these
enticements
to
greedy
desires
crucified
him
joined
to
the
sum
of
sorrows
accumulated
since
the
dawn
the
overcharge
of
these
sorrows
overwhelmed
him
and
a
cold
sweat
bathed
him
from
head
to
foot
he
was
in
agony
and
suddenly
as
though
he
had
come
to
overlook
his
ministers
and
to
see
if
his
orders
were
carried
out
the
executioner
himself
entered
on
the
scene
durtal
did
not
see
him
but
felt
him
and
it
was
indescribable
since
he
had
the
impression
of
a
real
demoniac
presence
his
whole
soul
trembled
and
desired
to
fly
like
a
terrified
bird
that
clings
to
the
and
it
fell
back
exhausted
then
unlikely
as
it
may
appear
the
parts
of
his
life
were
inverted
the
body
was
upright
and
held
its
own
commanding
the
terrified
soul
repressed
this
panic
in
a
furious
tension
durtal
perceived
very
plainly
and
clearly
for
the
first
time
the
distinction
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
and
for
the
first
time
also
he
was
conscious
of
the
phenomenon
of
a
body
which
had
so
tortured
its
companion
by
its
needs
and
wants
to
forget
all
its
hatred
in
the
common
danger
and
hinder
her
who
resisted
it
the
habit
of
sinking
he
saw
that
in
a
flash
and
suddenly
all
vanished
it
seemed
that
the
demon
had
taken
himself
off
the
wall
of
darkness
which
encompassed
durtal
opened
and
light
issued
from
all
parts
with
an
immense
impulse
the
salve
regina
springing
up
from
the
choir
swept
aside
the
phantoms
and
put
the
goblins
to
flight
the
elevated
cordial
of
this
chant
restored
him
he
took
courage
and
began
again
to
hope
that
this
frightful
desertion
might
cease
he
prayed
and
his
petitions
found
vent
he
understood
that
they
were
at
last
heard
the
office
was
at
an
end
he
gained
the
and
when
he
appeared
so
worn
out
and
pale
before
father
etienne
and
the
oblate
they
cried
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
sank
on
a
chair
and
endeavoured
to
describe
to
them
the
terrible
calvary
he
had
climbed
this
has
lasted
he
said
for
more
than
nine
hours
i
wonder
that
i
have
not
gone
mad
and
he
added
yet
i
never
could
have
believed
that
the
soul
could
suffer
so
much
the
face
of
the
father
was
illuminated
he
pressed
durtal
hands
and
said
rejoice
my
brother
you
have
been
treated
here
like
a
monk
how
is
that
said
durtal
surprised
yes
this
agony
for
there
is
no
other
word
to
define
the
horror
of
the
state
is
one
of
the
most
serious
trials
which
god
inflicts
on
us
it
is
one
of
the
operations
of
the
purgative
life
be
happy
for
it
is
a
great
grace
which
jesus
does
to
you
and
this
proves
that
your
conversion
is
good
affirmed
the
oblate
god
but
it
was
not
he
at
any
rate
who
insinuated
doubts
about
the
faith
who
caused
to
be
born
in
me
that
madness
of
scruples
who
raised
in
me
that
spirit
of
blasphemy
who
caressed
my
face
with
disgusting
apparitions
no
but
he
allows
it
it
is
frightful
i
know
it
said
the
god
conceals
himself
and
however
you
may
call
on
him
he
does
not
answer
you
you
think
yourself
deserted
yet
he
is
very
near
you
and
while
he
effaces
himself
satan
advances
he
twists
you
about
places
a
microscope
over
your
faults
his
malice
gnaws
your
brain
like
a
dull
file
and
when
to
all
this
are
joined
to
try
you
to
the
utmost
impure
visions
the
trappist
stopped
then
speaking
to
himself
he
said
slowly
it
would
be
nothing
to
be
in
presence
of
a
real
temptation
of
a
true
woman
in
flesh
and
bone
but
these
appearances
on
which
imagination
works
are
horrible
and
i
used
to
think
there
was
peace
in
the
cloister
no
we
are
here
on
this
earth
to
strive
and
it
is
just
in
the
cloister
that
the
lowest
works
there
souls
escape
him
and
he
will
at
all
price
conquer
them
no
place
on
earth
is
more
haunted
by
him
than
a
cell
no
one
is
more
harassed
than
a
monk
a
story
which
is
told
in
the
lives
of
the
fathers
in
the
desert
is
typical
from
this
point
of
view
one
demon
only
was
charged
to
watch
a
town
and
he
went
to
sleep
while
two
or
three
hundred
demons
who
had
orders
to
guard
a
monastery
had
no
rest
but
behaved
themselves
here
is
the
place
for
the
phrase
like
very
devils
and
indeed
the
mission
to
increase
the
sin
of
the
towns
is
a
sinecure
for
satan
holds
them
though
they
are
not
aware
of
it
all
then
he
has
to
do
is
to
torment
them
so
as
to
take
from
them
trust
in
god
since
all
obey
him
without
his
taking
the
least
trouble
about
it
and
so
he
keeps
his
legions
to
besiege
convents
where
resistance
is
determined
and
indeed
you
see
the
way
in
which
he
conducts
the
attack
ah
exclaimed
durtal
it
is
not
he
who
makes
you
suffer
the
most
for
what
is
worse
than
scruples
worse
than
temptations
against
purity
or
against
the
faith
is
the
supposed
abandonment
of
heaven
no
nothing
can
describe
that
that
is
what
mystical
theology
calls
night
obscure
answered
bruno
and
durtal
exclaimed
ah
now
i
am
with
you
i
remember
that
is
why
saint
john
of
the
cross
declares
that
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
sorrows
of
that
night
and
why
he
exaggerates
nothing
when
he
says
that
one
is
then
plunged
alive
into
hell
and
i
doubted
the
veracity
of
his
books
i
accused
him
of
excess
rather
he
minimized
only
one
must
have
felt
this
oneself
to
believe
it
and
you
have
seen
nothing
the
oblate
replied
quietly
you
have
passed
through
the
first
portion
of
that
night
through
the
night
of
the
senses
it
is
terrible
enough
as
i
know
by
experience
but
it
is
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
night
of
the
spirit
which
sometimes
succeeds
it
that
is
the
exact
image
of
the
sufferings
which
our
lord
endured
in
the
garden
of
olives
when
sweating
blood
he
cried
at
the
end
of
his
force
let
this
chalice
pass
from
me
this
is
so
terrible
and
bruno
was
silent
and
grew
pale
whoever
has
undergone
that
martyrdom
he
said
after
a
pause
knows
beforehand
what
awaits
the
damned
in
another
life
but
said
the
monk
the
hour
of
has
struck
there
exists
but
one
remedy
for
all
these
evils
the
holy
eucharist
sunday
the
community
approaches
the
sacrament
you
must
join
us
but
i
can
not
communicate
in
the
state
in
which
i
am
well
then
be
up
at
three
i
will
come
for
you
to
your
cell
and
will
take
you
to
father
maximin
who
confesses
us
at
that
time
and
without
waiting
for
his
answer
the
pressed
his
hand
and
went
he
is
right
said
the
oblate
it
is
the
true
remedy
and
when
he
had
regained
his
room
durtal
thought
i
now
understand
why
the
abbé
gévresin
made
such
a
point
of
lending
me
saint
john
of
the
cross
he
knew
that
i
should
enter
into
the
obscure
he
did
not
dare
warn
me
clearly
for
fear
of
alarming
me
and
yet
he
would
put
me
on
my
guard
against
despair
and
aid
me
by
the
remembrance
here
of
that
reading
only
how
could
he
think
that
in
such
a
shipwreck
i
should
remember
anything
all
this
makes
me
think
that
i
have
omitted
to
write
to
him
and
that
i
must
keep
my
promise
by
sending
him
a
letter
and
he
thought
again
of
saint
john
of
the
cross
that
extraordinary
carmelite
who
described
so
placidly
that
terrible
phase
of
the
mystic
genesis
he
took
count
of
the
lucidity
the
power
of
spirit
of
this
saint
explaining
the
most
obscure
vicissitude
of
the
soul
and
the
least
known
catching
and
following
the
operations
of
god
who
dealt
with
that
soul
pressed
it
in
his
hands
squeezed
it
like
a
sponge
then
let
it
suck
up
again
fill
itself
out
with
sorrows
then
wrung
it
again
making
it
drip
tears
of
blood
to
cleanse
it
chapter
vi
no
said
durtal
in
a
whisper
i
will
not
take
the
place
of
these
good
people
but
i
assure
you
it
is
quite
the
same
to
them
and
while
durtal
was
still
refusing
to
go
before
the
lay
brothers
who
were
waiting
their
turn
for
confession
father
etienne
insisted
i
will
stay
with
you
and
as
soon
as
the
cell
is
free
you
will
enter
durtal
was
then
on
the
landing
of
a
staircase
on
every
step
of
which
was
posted
a
brother
kneeling
or
standing
his
head
wrapped
in
his
hood
his
face
turned
to
the
wall
all
were
sifting
and
closely
examining
their
souls
of
what
sins
can
they
really
accuse
themselves
thought
durtal
who
knows
he
continued
perceiving
brother
anacletus
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
and
his
hands
joined
who
knows
if
he
does
not
reproach
himself
for
the
discreet
affection
he
has
for
me
for
in
monasteries
all
friendship
is
forbidden
and
he
called
to
memory
in
the
way
of
perfection
of
saint
teresa
a
page
at
once
glowing
and
icy
in
which
she
cries
out
on
the
nothingness
of
human
ties
declares
that
friendship
is
a
weakness
and
asserts
clearly
that
every
nun
who
desires
to
see
her
relations
is
imperfect
come
said
father
etienne
who
interrupted
these
reflections
and
pushed
him
towards
the
door
of
the
cell
out
of
which
a
monk
came
father
maximin
was
there
seated
close
to
a
durtal
knelt
and
told
him
briefly
his
scruples
and
strifes
of
the
evening
before
what
has
happened
to
you
is
not
surprising
after
a
conversion
indeed
it
is
a
good
sign
for
those
persons
alone
for
whom
god
has
views
are
submitted
to
these
proofs
said
the
monk
slowly
when
durtal
had
ended
his
story
and
he
continued
now
that
you
have
no
more
grave
sins
the
demon
endeavours
to
drown
you
by
spitting
at
you
in
fact
in
these
episodes
of
malice
at
bay
there
is
for
you
temptation
and
no
sin
you
have
if
i
may
sum
up
what
you
have
said
undergone
temptation
of
the
flesh
and
of
faith
and
you
have
been
tortured
by
scruples
let
us
leave
on
one
side
the
sensual
visions
such
as
they
have
been
were
produced
independently
of
your
will
painful
no
doubt
but
ineffectual
doubts
about
faith
are
more
dangerous
steep
yourself
in
this
truth
that
besides
prayer
there
exists
but
one
efficacious
remedy
against
this
evil
to
despise
it
satan
is
pride
despise
him
and
at
once
his
audacity
gives
way
he
speaks
shrug
your
shoulders
and
he
is
silent
you
must
not
discuss
with
him
however
good
a
reasoner
you
may
be
you
will
be
worsted
for
he
is
a
most
tricky
dialectician
yes
but
what
can
i
do
i
do
not
wish
to
listen
to
him
but
i
hear
him
all
the
same
i
was
obliged
to
answer
him
if
only
to
refute
him
and
it
was
just
on
that
he
counted
to
subdue
you
keep
this
carefully
in
your
mind
in
order
to
let
you
give
him
an
easy
throw
he
will
present
you
at
need
grotesque
arguments
and
so
soon
as
he
sees
you
confident
simply
satisfied
with
the
excellence
of
your
replies
he
will
involve
you
in
sophisms
so
specious
that
you
will
fight
in
vain
to
solve
them
no
i
repeat
to
you
had
you
the
best
reasons
to
oppose
to
him
do
not
riposte
refuse
the
strife
the
prior
was
silent
then
he
began
again
quietly
there
are
two
ways
of
getting
rid
of
a
thing
which
troubles
you
to
throw
it
far
away
or
let
it
fall
to
throw
it
to
a
distance
demands
an
effort
of
which
one
may
not
be
capable
to
let
it
fall
imposes
no
fatigue
is
simple
without
danger
within
the
reach
of
all
to
throw
to
a
distance
implies
again
a
certain
interest
a
certain
animation
perhaps
even
a
certain
fear
to
let
it
fall
is
indifference
complete
contempt
believe
me
use
this
means
and
satan
will
fly
this
weapon
of
contempt
will
be
also
to
conquer
the
assault
of
scruples
if
in
combats
of
this
nature
the
person
assailed
sees
clear
unfortunately
the
peculiarity
of
scruples
is
to
alarm
people
to
make
them
lose
at
once
the
clearing
breeze
and
then
it
is
indispensable
to
have
recourse
to
a
priest
to
defend
oneself
indeed
pursued
the
monk
who
had
interrupted
himself
a
moment
to
think
the
closer
one
looks
the
less
one
sees
one
becomes
the
moment
one
observes
it
is
necessary
to
place
oneself
at
a
certain
point
of
view
to
distinguish
objects
for
when
they
are
very
close
they
become
as
confused
as
if
they
were
far
therefore
in
such
a
case
we
must
have
recourse
to
the
confessor
who
is
neither
too
distant
nor
too
near
who
holds
himself
precisely
at
the
spot
where
objects
detach
themselves
in
their
relief
only
it
is
with
scruples
as
with
certain
maladies
which
when
they
are
not
taken
in
time
become
almost
incurable
do
not
allow
them
then
to
become
implanted
in
you
scruple
can
not
resist
being
told
as
soon
as
it
begins
the
moment
you
formulate
it
before
the
priest
it
dissolves
it
is
a
kind
of
mirage
which
a
word
effaces
you
will
object
to
me
continued
the
monk
after
a
silence
that
it
is
very
mortifying
to
avow
delusions
which
generally
are
absurd
but
it
is
for
this
very
reason
that
the
demon
suggests
to
you
less
clever
arguments
than
foolish
he
takes
hold
of
you
thus
by
vanity
by
false
shame
the
monk
was
silent
again
then
he
continued
scruples
not
treated
scruples
not
cured
lead
to
discouragement
which
is
the
worst
of
temptations
for
in
other
cases
satan
attacks
one
virtue
only
in
particular
and
he
shows
himself
while
in
this
case
he
attacks
all
at
once
and
he
hides
himself
and
this
is
so
true
that
if
you
are
seduced
by
lust
by
the
love
of
money
or
by
pride
you
can
in
examining
yourself
give
yourself
account
of
the
nature
of
the
temptation
which
exhausts
you
in
discouragement
on
the
contrary
your
understanding
is
obscured
to
such
a
degree
that
you
do
not
even
suspect
that
the
state
in
which
you
succumb
is
only
a
diabolic
manoeuvre
which
you
must
combat
and
you
let
go
all
you
give
up
the
only
arm
which
can
save
you
prayer
from
which
the
demon
turns
you
aside
as
a
vain
thing
never
hesitate
then
to
cut
the
evil
at
its
root
to
take
care
of
a
scruple
as
soon
as
it
is
born
now
tell
me
you
have
nothing
else
to
confess
no
except
the
indesire
for
the
eucharist
the
languor
in
which
i
now
faint
there
is
some
fatigue
in
your
case
for
no
one
can
endure
such
a
shock
with
impunity
do
not
be
uneasy
about
that
have
confidence
do
not
attempt
to
present
yourself
before
god
all
neat
and
trim
go
to
him
simply
naturally
in
undress
even
just
as
you
are
do
not
forget
that
if
you
are
a
servant
you
are
also
a
son
have
good
courage
our
lord
will
dispel
all
these
nightmares
and
when
he
had
received
absolution
durtal
went
down
to
the
church
to
await
the
hour
of
mass
and
when
the
moment
for
communion
came
he
followed
bruno
behind
the
lay
brothers
all
were
kneeling
on
the
pavement
and
one
after
the
other
rose
to
exchange
the
kiss
of
peace
and
reach
the
altar
though
he
repeated
to
himself
the
counsels
of
father
maximin
though
he
exhorted
himself
to
dismiss
all
his
unrest
durtal
could
not
help
thinking
as
he
saw
these
monks
approach
the
table
the
lord
will
find
a
change
when
i
advance
in
my
turn
after
having
descended
into
the
sanctuaries
he
will
be
reduced
to
visit
hovel
and
sincerely
humbly
he
was
sorry
for
him
and
as
the
first
time
that
he
approached
this
mystery
he
experienced
a
sensation
of
stifling
as
if
his
heart
were
too
large
when
he
returned
to
his
place
as
soon
as
the
mass
was
over
he
quitted
the
chapel
and
escaped
into
the
park
then
gently
without
sensible
effects
the
sacrament
worked
christ
opened
little
by
little
his
closed
house
and
gave
it
air
light
entered
into
durtal
in
a
flood
from
the
windows
of
his
senses
which
had
looked
till
then
into
he
knew
not
what
cesspool
into
what
enclosure
dank
and
steeped
in
shadow
he
now
looked
suddenly
through
a
burst
of
light
on
a
vista
which
lost
itself
in
heaven
his
vision
of
nature
was
modified
the
surroundings
were
transformed
the
fog
of
sadness
which
visited
them
vanished
the
sudden
clearness
of
his
soul
was
repeated
in
its
surroundings
he
had
the
sensation
of
expansion
the
almost
childlike
joy
of
a
sick
man
who
takes
his
first
outing
of
the
convalescent
who
having
long
crawled
in
a
chamber
sets
foot
without
all
grew
young
again
these
alleys
this
wood
through
which
he
had
wandered
so
much
which
he
began
to
know
in
all
their
windings
and
in
every
corner
began
to
appear
to
him
in
a
new
aspect
a
restrained
joy
a
repressed
gladness
emanated
from
this
site
which
appeared
to
him
instead
of
extending
as
formerly
to
draw
near
and
gather
round
the
crucifix
to
turn
as
it
were
with
attention
towards
the
liquid
cross
the
trees
rustled
trembling
in
a
whisper
of
prayers
inclining
towards
the
christ
who
no
longer
twisted
his
painful
arms
in
the
mirror
of
the
pool
but
he
constrained
these
waters
and
displayed
them
before
him
blessing
them
they
were
themselves
different
the
dark
fluid
was
covered
with
monastic
visions
in
white
robes
which
the
reflections
of
clouds
left
there
in
passing
and
the
swan
scattered
them
in
a
splash
of
sunlight
making
as
he
swam
great
oily
circles
round
him
one
might
have
said
that
these
waves
were
gilt
by
the
oil
of
the
catechumens
and
the
sacred
chrism
which
the
church
exorcises
on
the
saturday
of
holy
week
and
above
them
heaven
its
tabernacle
of
clouds
out
of
which
came
a
clear
sun
like
a
monstrance
of
molten
gold
in
a
blessed
sacrament
of
flames
it
was
a
benediction
of
nature
a
genuflection
of
trees
and
flowers
singing
in
the
wind
incensing
with
their
perfume
the
sacred
bread
which
shone
on
high
in
the
flaming
custody
of
the
planet
durtal
looked
on
in
transport
he
desired
to
cry
aloud
his
enthusiasm
and
his
faith
to
the
landscape
he
felt
a
joy
in
living
the
horror
of
existence
counted
for
nothing
when
there
were
such
moments
as
no
earthly
happiness
can
give
god
alone
had
the
power
of
thus
filling
a
soul
of
making
it
overflow
and
rush
in
floods
of
joy
and
he
alone
could
also
fill
the
basin
of
sorrows
as
no
event
in
this
world
could
do
durtal
had
just
tried
it
his
spiritual
sufferings
and
joys
attained
under
the
divine
imprint
an
acuteness
which
people
most
humanly
happy
or
unhappy
can
not
even
suspect
this
idea
brought
him
back
to
the
terrible
distresses
of
the
evening
before
he
endeavoured
to
sum
up
what
he
had
been
able
to
observe
of
himself
in
this
trappist
monastery
first
the
clear
distinction
between
body
and
soul
then
the
action
of
the
demon
insinuating
and
obstinate
almost
visible
while
the
heavenly
action
remained
on
the
contrary
dull
and
veiled
appeared
only
at
certain
moments
and
seemed
at
others
to
vanish
for
ever
and
all
this
when
felt
and
understood
had
an
appearance
simple
in
itself
but
scarcely
explaining
itself
the
body
appearing
to
throw
itself
forward
to
the
rescue
of
the
soul
and
no
doubt
borrowing
from
it
its
will
to
help
it
when
it
fainted
was
unintelligible
how
a
body
could
itself
react
obscurely
and
yet
show
all
at
once
so
strong
a
decision
that
it
pressed
its
companion
into
a
vice
and
prevented
its
flight
it
is
as
mysterious
as
the
rest
thought
durtal
and
as
in
a
dream
he
continued
the
secret
action
of
jesus
in
his
sacrament
is
not
less
strange
if
i
may
judge
by
what
has
happened
to
me
a
first
communion
exasperates
the
action
of
the
devil
while
a
second
represses
it
ah
and
how
i
put
myself
in
line
with
all
my
calculations
in
taking
shelter
here
i
thought
myself
pretty
sure
of
my
soul
and
that
my
body
would
trouble
me
whereas
just
the
contrary
has
been
the
case
my
stomach
has
grown
vigorous
and
shown
itself
fit
to
support
an
effort
of
which
i
should
never
have
thought
it
capable
and
my
soul
has
been
below
everything
vacillating
and
dry
so
fragile
so
feeble
but
we
will
let
all
that
alone
he
walked
about
lifted
from
earth
by
a
confused
joy
he
grew
vaporized
in
a
sort
of
intoxication
in
a
vague
etherization
in
which
arose
without
his
even
thinking
of
formulating
words
acts
of
thanksgiving
it
was
an
effort
of
thanks
of
his
soul
of
his
body
of
his
whole
being
to
that
god
whom
he
felt
living
in
him
and
diffused
in
that
kneeling
landscape
which
also
seemed
to
expand
in
mute
hymns
of
gratitude
the
hour
which
struck
by
the
clock
in
the
portico
reminded
him
it
was
breakfast
time
he
went
to
the
cut
himself
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
with
some
cheese
drank
half
a
glass
of
wine
and
was
about
to
go
out
again
when
he
reflected
that
the
horary
of
the
offices
was
changed
they
must
be
different
from
those
of
the
week
he
thought
and
he
went
up
into
his
cell
to
consult
his
placards
he
found
only
one
that
of
the
rule
of
the
monks
themselves
which
contained
the
regulations
for
the
sunday
practices
for
the

copied

in

he
said
to
himself

here

without

that
i
got
up
at

this
morning
he
concluded
and
when
he
reached
the
chapel
about
nine
he
found
the
greater
part
of
the
lay
brothers
on
their
knees
the
others
saying
their
rosary
and
when
the
clock
struck
all
returned
to
their
place
assisted
by
two
fathers
in
cowls
the
prior
vested
in
a
white
alb
entered
and
while
the
antiphon
asperges
me
domine
hyssopo
et
mundabor
was
sung
all
the
monks
in
succession
defiled
before
father
maximin
standing
on
the
steps
turning
his
back
to
the
altar
and
he
sprinkled
them
with
holy
water
while
they
regained
their
stalls
each
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
then
the
prior
descended
from
the
altar
and
came
to
the
entrance
to
the
vestibule
where
he
dispersed
the
water
crosswise
traced
by
the
sprinkler
over
the
oblate
and
over
durtal
at
last
he
vested
and
went
to
celebrate
the
sacrifice
then
durtal
was
able
to
think
over
his
sundays
at
the
benedictine
nuns
the
kyrie
eleison
was
the
same
but
slower
and
more
sonorous
more
grave
on
the
prolonged
termination
of
the
last
word
at
paris
the
voices
of
the
nuns
drew
it
out
and
put
a
gloss
on
it
at
the
same
time
turned
into
satin
its
final
sound
rendered
it
less
dull
less
spaced
less
ample
the
gloria
in
excelsis
differed
that
of
la
trappe
was
more
primitive
more
mounting
more
sombre
interesting
by
its
very
barbarism
but
less
touching
for
in
its
forms
of
adoration
in
the
adoramus
te
for
example
the
te
did
not
detach
itself
did
not
drop
like
a
tear
of
amorous
essence
like
an
avowal
retained
by
humility
on
the
tip
of
the
lips
but
it
was
when
the
credo
arose
that
durtal
could
uplift
himself
at
ease
he
had
never
yet
heard
it
so
authoritative
and
so
imposing
it
advanced
chanted
in
unison
developing
its
slow
procession
of
dogmas
in
sounds
well
furnished
and
rigid
of
a
violet
almost
obscure
a
red
almost
black
growing
lighter
towards
the
end
till
it
expired
in
a
long
and
plaintive
amen
in
following
the
cistercian
office
durtal
could
recognize
the
morsels
of
plain
chant
still
preserved
in
parish
masses
all
the
part
of
the
canon
the
sursum
corda
the
vere
dignum
the
antiphons
the
pater
remained
intact
only
the
sanctus
and
the
agnus
dei
were
changed
massive
built
up
as
it
were
in
the
roman
style
they
draped
themselves
in
the
colour
glowing
and
dull
which
clothes
in
fact
the
offices
of
la
trappe
well
said
the
oblate
when
after
the
ceremony
they
sat
at
the
table
of
the
refectory
well
what
do
you
think
of
our
high
mass
it
is
superb
answered
durtal
and
he
said
dreamily
would
that
one
could
have
the
whole
complete
to
bring
here
instead
of
this
uninteresting
chapel
the
apse
of
severin
hang
on
the
walls
the
pictures
of
fra
angelico
memling
grünewald
gerard
david
roger
van
den
weyden
bouts
add
to
these
admirable
sculptures
such
as
those
of
the
great
door
of
chartres
altar
screens
of
sculptured
wood
such
as
those
of
the
cathedral
of
amiens
what
a
dream
yet
he
went
on
after
a
silence
this
dream
has
been
a
reality
it
is
evident
this
ideal
church
existed
for
ages
everywhere
in
the
middle
ages
the
chant
the
goldsmith
work
the
panels
the
sculptures
the
tissues
were
all
attractive
the
liturgies
possessed
to
give
them
value
fabulous
caskets
but
all
that
is
far
off
but
you
certainly
can
not
say
replied
bruno
with
a
smile
that
the
church
ornaments
are
ugly
here
no
they
are
exquisite
first
the
chasubles
have
not
the
shapes
of
a
miner
apron
and
they
do
not
hoist
themselves
up
on
the
shoulders
of
the
priest
that
excrescence
that
puffing
like
the
ear
of
a
little
donkey
lying
back
which
the
vestment
makers
use
at
paris
nor
is
it
any
more
that
cross
in
stripe
or
woven
filling
all
the
stuff
falling
like
a
over
the
back
of
the
celebrant
the
trappist
chasubles
have
kept
the
old
form
as
the
old
image
makers
and
the
old
painters
preserved
them
in
their
religious
scenes
and
that
cross
with
four
leaves
like
those
which
the
gothic
style
chiselled
on
the
walls
of
its
churches
is
related
to
the
very
expanded
lotus
a
flower
so
that
its
falling
petals
droop
without
counting
pursued
durtal
that
the
stuff
which
seems
cut
in
a
sort
of
flannel
or
thick
soft
felt
must
have
been
plunged
in
threefold
dyes
for
it
takes
a
depth
and
a
magnificent
clearness
of
tone
the
religious
could
trim
these
watered
and
plain
silks
with
silver
and
gold
yet
never
attain
to
give
a
colour
at
once
so
vehement
and
so
familiar
to
the
eye
as
that
crimson
with
flowers
which
father
maximin
wore
the
other
day
yes
and
the
mourning
chasuble
with
its
lobed
crosses
and
its
discreet
white
fullings
in
which
the
father
abbot
vested
himself
the
day
on
which
he
communicated
us
is
not
it
also
a
caress
for
the
eyes
durtal
sighed
ah
if
the
statues
in
the
chapel
showed
a
like
taste
by
the
way
said
the
oblate
come
and
salute
that
notre
dame
de
of
which
i
have
spoken
to
you
found
among
the
remains
of
the
old
cloister
they
rose
from
table
passed
along
a
corridor
and
struck
into
a
lateral
gallery
at
the
end
of
which
they
stopped
before
a
statue
of
life
size
in
stone
it
was
heavy
and
massive
representing
in
a
robe
of
long
folds
a
peasant
woman
crowned
and
holding
on
her
arm
a
child
who
blessed
a
ball
but
in
this
portrait
of
a
robust
peasant
woman
sprung
from
burgundy
or
flanders
there
was
a
candour
a
goodness
almost
tumultuous
which
sprang
from
her
smiling
face
her
innocent
eyes
her
good
and
large
lips
indulgent
ready
for
all
forgiveness
she
was
a
rustic
virgin
made
for
the
humble
lay
brothers
she
was
not
a
great
lady
who
could
hold
them
at
a
distance
but
she
was
indeed
the
nursing
mother
of
their
souls
their
true
mother
how
was
it
they
had
not
understood
her
here
how
instead
of
presiding
in
the
chapel
did
she
grow
chill
at
the
end
of
a
corridor
cried
durtal
the
oblate
turned
the
conversation
i
warn
you
he
said
that
benediction
will
not
take
place
after
vespers
as
your
placard
indicates
but
directly
after
compline
this
latter
office
will
therefore
be
advanced
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
least
and
the
oblate
went
up
to
his
cell
while
durtal
went
towards
the
large
pond
there
he
lay
down
on
a
bed
of
dry
reed
looking
at
the
water
which
broke
in
wavelets
at
his
feet
the
coming
and
going
of
these
limited
waters
folding
back
on
themselves
yet
never
overpassing
the
basin
they
had
hollowed
for
themselves
led
him
on
into
long
reveries
he
said
to
himself
that
a
river
was
the
most
exact
symbol
of
the
active
life
one
follows
it
from
its
source
through
all
its
courses
across
the
territories
it
fertilizes
it
has
fulfilled
its
assigned
task
before
it
dies
immersing
itself
in
the
gaping
sepulchre
of
the
seas
but
the
pond
that
tamed
water
imprisoned
in
a
hedge
of
reeds
which
it
has
itself
caused
to
grow
in
fertilizing
the
soil
of
its
bank
has
concentrated
itself
lived
on
itself
not
seemed
to
achieve
any
known
work
save
to
keep
silence
and
reflect
on
the
infinite
of
heaven
still
water
troubles
me
continued
durtal
it
seems
to
me
that
unable
to
extend
itself
it
grows
deeper
and
that
while
running
waters
borrow
only
the
shadows
of
things
they
reflect
it
swallows
them
without
giving
them
back
most
certainly
in
this
pond
is
a
continued
and
profound
absorption
of
forgotten
clouds
of
lost
trees
even
of
sensations
seized
on
the
faces
of
monks
who
hung
over
it
this
water
is
full
and
not
empty
like
those
which
are
distracted
in
wandering
about
the
country
and
in
bathing
the
towns
it
is
a
contemplative
water
in
perfect
accord
with
the
recollected
life
of
the
cloisters
the
fact
is
he
concluded
that
a
river
would
have
here
no
meaning
it
would
only
be
passing
would
remain
indifferent
and
in
a
hurry
would
be
in
all
cases
unfit
to
pacify
the
soul
which
the
monastic
water
of
the
ponds
appeases
ah
in
founding
notre
dame
de
saint
bernard
knew
how
to
fit
the
cistercian
rule
and
the
site
but
we
must
leave
these
fancies
he
said
rising
and
remembering
that
it
was
sunday
he
transferred
himself
to
paris
and
revisited
in
thought
his
halts
on
this
day
in
the
churches
in
the
morning
severin
enchanted
him
but
he
ought
not
to
thrust
himself
into
that
sanctuary
for
the
other
offices
vespers
there
were
botched
and
mean
and
if
it
were
a
feast
day
the
organ
master
showed
himself
possessed
by
the
love
of
ignoble
music
occasionally
durtal
had
taken
refuge
at
gervais
where
at
least
they
played
at
certain
times
motets
of
the
old
masters
but
that
church
was
as
well
as
eustache
a
paying
concert
where
faith
had
nothing
to
do
no
recollection
was
possible
in
the
midst
of
ladies
who
fainted
behind
their
faces
in
their
hands
and
grew
agitated
in
creaking
chairs
these
were
frivolous
assemblies
for
pious
music
a
compromise
between
the
theatre
and
god
sulpice
was
better
where
at
least
the
public
was
silent
there
moreover
vespers
were
celebrated
with
more
solemnity
and
less
haste
in
general
the
seminary
reinforced
the
choir
and
rendered
by
this
imposing
choir
they
rolled
on
majestically
sustained
by
the
grand
organ
chanted
only
in
half
and
not
in
unison
reduced
to
a
state
of
couplets
given
some
by
a
baritone
others
by
the
choir
they
were
twisted
and
frizzled
by
a
curling
iron
but
as
they
were
not
less
adulterated
at
the
other
churches
there
was
every
advantage
in
listening
to
them
at
sulpice
whose
powerful
choir
very
well
led
had
not
as
for
example
at
notre
dame
those
dusty
voices
which
break
at
the
least
whisper
this
only
became
really
odious
when
with
a
formidable
explosion
the
first
strophe
of
the
magnificat
struck
the
arches
the
organ
then
swallowed
up
one
stanza
out
of
two
and
under
the
seditious
pretext
that
the
length
of
the
office
of
incensing
was
too
long
to
be
filled
up
entirely
by
singing
widor
seated
at
his
desk
rolled
forth
stale
fragments
of
music
splashed
about
above
imitating
the
human
voice
and
the
flute
the
bagpipe
and
the
bassoon
or
indeed
tired
of
affectations
he
blew
furiously
on
the
keys
ending
by
imitating
the
roll
of
locomotives
over
iron
bridges
letting
all
the
stops
go
and
the
choirmaster
not
wishing
to
show
himself
inferior
to
the
organist
in
his
instinctive
hatred
of
plain
chant
was
delighted
when
the
benediction
began
to
put
aside
gregorian
melodies
and
make
his
choristers
gurgle
rigadoons
it
was
no
longer
a
sanctuary
but
a
howling
place
the
ave
maria
the
ave
verum
all
the
mystical
indecencies
of
the
late
gounod
the
rhapsodies
of
old
thomas
the
capers
of
indigent
musicasters
defiled
in
a
chain
wound
by
choir
leaders
from
lamoureux
chanted
unfortunately
by
children
the
chastity
of
whose
voices
no
one
feared
to
pollute
in
these
passages
of
music
these
of
art
ah
thought
durtal
if
only
this
choirmaster
who
is
evidently
an
excellent
musician
for
indeed
when
he
must
he
knows
how
to
get
executed
better
than
anywhere
else
in
paris
the
profundis
with
organ
accompaniment
and
the
iræ
if
only
this
man
would
as
at
gervais
give
us
some
palestrina
and
vittoria
some
aichinger
and
allegri
some
orlando
lasso
and
de
près
but
no
he
must
detest
these
masters
also
consider
them
as
archaic
rubbish
good
to
send
into
the
and
durtal
continued
what
we
hear
now
at
paris
in
the
churches
is
wholly
incredible
under
pretence
of
managing
an
income
for
the
singers
they
suppress
half
the
stanzas
of
canticles
and
hymns
and
substitute
to
vary
the
pleasure
the
tiresome
divagations
of
an
organ
there
they
howl
the
ergo
to
the
austrian
national
air
or
what
is
still
worse
muffle
it
up
with
operatic
choruses
or
refrains
from
canteens
the
very
text
is
divided
into
couplets
which
are
ornamented
like
a
drinking
song
with
a
little
burthen
the
other
church
sequences
are
treated
in
the
same
manner
and
yet
the
papacy
has
formally
forbidden
in
many
bulls
that
the
sanctuary
should
be
soiled
by
those
liberties
to
cite
one
only
john
in
his
extravagant
sanctorum
expressly
forbade
profane
voices
and
music
in
churches
he
prohibited
choirs
at
the
same
time
to
change
plain
chant
into
fiorituri
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
trent
are
not
less
clear
from
this
point
of
view
and
more
recently
still
a
regulation
of
the
sacred
congregation
of
rites
has
intervened
to
proscribe
musical
rioting
in
holy
places
then
what
are
the
doing
who
in
fact
have
musical
police
charge
in
their
churches
nothing
they
laugh
at
it
nor
is
this
a
mere
phrase
but
with
those
priests
who
hoping
for
receipts
permit
on
fête
days
the
shameless
voices
of
actresses
to
dance
gambols
to
the
heavy
sounds
of
the
organ
the
poor
church
has
become
far
from
clean
at
sulpice
durtal
went
on
the
priest
tolerates
the
villainy
of
jolly
songs
which
are
served
up
to
him
but
at
least
he
does
not
like
the
one
at
severin
allow
strolling
women
players
to
lighten
up
the
office
by
the
shouts
of
such
voices
as
remain
to
them
nor
has
he
accepted
the
solo
on
the
english
horn
which
i
heard
at
thomas
one
evening
during
the
perpetual
adoration
in
short
if
the
grand
benedictions
at
sulpice
are
a
shame
the
complines
remain
in
spite
of
their
theatrical
attitude
really
charming
and
durtal
thought
of
those
complines
of
which
the
paternity
is
often
attributed
to
saint
benedict
they
were
in
fact
the
integral
prayer
of
the
evenings
the
preventive
adjuration
the
safeguard
against
the
attempts
of
the
demon
they
were
in
some
measure
the
advanced
sentinels
of
the
placed
round
the
soul
to
protect
it
during
the
night
and
the
regulation
of
this
entrenched
camp
of
prayer
was
perfect
after
the
benediction
the
best
trained
voice
the
most
threadlike
of
the
choir
the
voice
of
the
smallest
of
the
children
sang
forth
the
short
lesson
taken
from
the
first
epistle
of
saint
peter
warning
the
faithful
that
they
must
be
sober
and
watch
not
allow
themselves
to
be
surprised
unexpectedly
a
priest
then
recited
the
usual
evening
prayers
the
choir
organ
gave
the
intonation
and
the
psalms
fell
chanted
one
by
one
the
twilight
psalms
in
which
before
the
approaches
of
night
peopled
with
goblins
and
furrowed
by
ghosts
man
calls
god
to
aid
and
prays
him
to
guard
his
sleep
from
the
violence
of
the
ways
of
hell
the
rape
of
the
lamias
that
pass
and
the
hymn
of
saint
ambrose
the
te
lucis
ante
terminum
made
still
more
precise
the
scattered
meaning
of
these
psalms
gathering
it
up
in
its
short
stanzas
unfortunately
the
most
important
that
which
foresees
and
declares
the
luxurious
dangers
of
darkness
was
swallowed
up
by
the
full
organ
this
hymn
was
not
rendered
in
plain
chant
at
sulpice
as
at
la
trappe
but
was
sung
to
a
pompous
and
elaborate
air
an
air
full
of
glory
with
a
certain
proud
attractiveness
originating
no
doubt
in
the
eighteenth
century
then
there
was
a
pause
and
man
feeling
himself
more
sheltered
behind
a
rampart
of
prayers
recollected
himself
more
assured
and
borrowed
innocent
voices
to
address
new
supplications
to
god
after
the
chapter
read
by
the
officiant
the
children
of
the
choir
chanted
the
short
response
in
manus
tuus
domine
commendo
spiritum
meum
which
rolled
out
dividing
in
two
parts
then
doubled
itself
and
resolved
at
the
last
its
two
separate
portions
by
a
verse
and
part
of
an
antiphon
and
after
that
prayer
there
was
still
the
canticle
of
simeon
who
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
the
messiah
desired
to
die
this
nunc
dimittis
which
the
church
has
incorporated
in
compline
to
stimulate
us
at
eventide
to
for
none
can
tell
whether
he
shall
wake
on
the
morrow
was
raised
by
the
whole
choir
which
alternated
with
the
responses
of
the
organ
in
fact
to
end
this
office
of
a
besieged
town
to
take
its
last
dispositions
and
try
to
repose
in
shelter
from
a
violent
attack
the
church
built
up
again
a
few
prayers
and
placed
her
parishes
under
the
tutelage
of
the
virgin
to
whom
it
chanted
one
of
the
four
antiphons
which
follow
according
to
the
proper
at
la
trappe
compline
was
evidently
less
solemn
less
interesting
than
at
sulpice
concluded
durtal
for
the
monastic
breviary
is
for
a
wonder
less
complete
for
that
office
than
the
roman
breviary
as
for
sunday
vespers
i
am
curious
to
hear
them
and
he
heard
them
but
they
hardly
differed
from
the
vespers
adopted
by
the
benedictine
nuns
of
the
rue
monsieur
they
were
more
massive
more
grave
more
roman
if
it
may
be
said
for
necessarily
the
voice
of
women
drew
them
out
into
sharp
points
made
them
like
acute
arches
as
it
were
in
gothic
style
but
the
gregorian
tunes
were
the
same
on
the
other
hand
they
resembled
in
nothing
those
at
sulpice
where
the
modern
sauces
spoilt
the
very
essences
of
the
plain
chants
only
the
magnificat
of
la
trappe
abrupt
and
with
dry
tone
was
not
so
good
as
the
majestic
the
admirable
royal
magnificat
chanted
at
paris
these
monks
are
astonishing
with
their
superb
voices
said
durtal
to
himself
and
he
smiled
as
they
finished
the
antiphon
of
our
lady
for
he
remembered
that
in
the
primitive
church
the
chanter
was
called
fabarius
cantor
eater
of
beans
because
he
was
obliged
to
eat
that
vegetable
to
strengthen
his
voice
now
at
la
trappe
dishes
of
beans
were
common
perhaps
that
was
the
secret
of
the
ever
young
monastic
voices
he
thought
over
the
liturgy
and
plain
chant
while
smoking
cigarettes
in
the
walks
after
vespers
he
brought
to
mind
the
symbolism
of
those
canonical
hours
which
recalled
every
day
to
the
christian
the
shortness
of
life
in
summing
up
for
him
its
image
from
infancy
to
death
recited
soon
after
dawn
prime
was
the
figure
of
childhood
tierce
of
youth
sext
the
full
vigour
of
age
none
the
approaches
of
old
age
while
vespers
were
an
allegory
of
decrepitude
they
belonged
moreover
to
the
nocturns
and
were
sung
about
six
in
the
evening
at
that
hour
when
at
the
time
of
the
equinoxes
the
sun
sets
in
the
red
cinder
of
the
clouds
as
for
compline
it
resounds
when
night
the
symbol
of
death
has
come
this
canonical
office
was
a
marvellous
rosary
of
psalms
every
bead
of
each
of
these
hours
bore
reference
to
the
different
phases
of
human
existence
followed
little
by
little
the
periods
of
the
day
the
decline
of
destiny
to
end
in
the
most
perfect
of
offices
in
compline
that
provisional
absolution
of
a
death
itself
represented
by
sleep
and
if
from
these
texts
so
wisely
selected
these
sequences
so
solemnly
sealed
durtal
passed
to
the
sacerdotal
robe
of
their
sounds
to
those
neumatic
chants
that
divine
psalmody
all
uniform
all
simple
which
is
plain
chant
he
had
to
admit
that
except
in
benedictine
cloisters
an
organ
accompaniment
was
everywhere
added
that
plain
chant
had
been
put
forcibly
in
modern
tonality
and
it
disappeared
under
vegetations
which
stifled
it
became
everywhere
discoloured
amorphous
and
incomprehensible
one
only
of
its
executioners
niedermayer
showed
himself
at
least
pitiful
he
tried
a
system
more
ingenious
and
more
honest
he
reversed
the
terms
of
torture
instead
of
wishing
to
make
plain
chant
supple
and
to
thrust
it
into
the
mould
of
modern
harmony
he
constrained
that
harmony
to
bend
itself
to
the
austere
tonality
of
plain
chant
he
thus
preserved
its
character
but
how
far
more
natural
would
it
have
been
to
leave
it
solitary
and
not
obliged
it
to
tow
an
useless
companion
and
awkward
following
here
at
least
at
la
trappe
it
lived
and
spread
in
all
security
without
treason
on
the
part
of
the
monks
there
was
always
sameness
of
sound
it
was
always
chanted
without
accompaniment
in
unison
he
was
able
to
satisfy
himself
about
this
truth
once
more
after
supper
that
evening
when
at
the
end
of
compline
the
father
sacristan
lighted
all
the
candles
on
the
altar
at
that
moment
in
the
silence
of
the
trappists
on
their
knees
their
head
in
their
hands
or
their
cheek
resting
on
the
sleeve
of
their
great
cowl
three
lay
brothers
entered
two
carrying
torches
and
another
preceding
them
with
a
censer
and
behind
them
a
few
paces
came
the
prior
with
his
hands
joined
durtal
looked
at
the
changed
costume
of
the
three
brothers
they
had
no
longer
their
robes
of
serge
made
of
bits
and
scraps
stained
mud
colour
but
robes
of
like
plums
on
which
was
spread
the
white
twilling
of
a
new
surplice
while
father
maximin
vested
in
a
copy
of
milky
white
woven
with
a
cross
in
orange
yellow
placed
the
host
in
the
monstrance
the
thurifer
put
down
the
censer
on
the
coals
of
which
melted
tears
of
real
incense
contrary
to
what
takes
place
in
paris
where
the
censer
swung
before
the
altar
sounds
against
its
chains
and
is
like
the
clear
tinkling
of
a
horse
which
as
he
lifts
his
head
shakes
his
curb
and
bit
the
censer
at
la
trappe
remained
immovable
before
the
altar
and
smoked
by
itself
behind
the
officiants
and
everyone
chanted
the
imploring
and
melancholy
antiphon
parce
domine
then
the
tantum
ergo
that
magnificent
song
which
could
be
almost
acted
so
clear
in
their
changes
are
the
sentiments
which
succeed
each
other
in
their
rhymed
sequence
in
the
first
stanza
it
seems
indeed
to
shake
the
head
gently
to
put
forward
the
chin
so
to
speak
so
as
to
affirm
the
insufficiency
of
the
senses
to
explain
the
dogma
of
the
real
presence
the
finished
avatar
of
the
bread
it
is
then
admiring
and
reflective
then
that
melody
so
attentive
so
respectful
does
not
wait
to
affirm
the
weakness
of
the
reason
and
the
power
of
faith
but
in
the
second
stanza
it
goes
forward
adores
the
glory
of
the
three
persons
exults
with
joy
only
recovers
itself
at
the
end
where
the
music
adds
a
new
sense
to
the
text
of
saint
thomas
in
avowing
in
a
long
and
mournful
amen
the
unworthiness
of
those
present
to
receive
the
benediction
of
the
flesh
placed
upon
that
cross
which
the
monstrance
is
about
to
trace
in
the
air
and
slowly
while
unrolling
its
coil
of
smoke
the
censer
spread
as
it
were
a
blue
gauze
before
the
altar
while
the
blessed
sacrament
was
lifted
like
a
golden
moon
amid
the
stars
of
the
tapers
sparkling
in
the
growing
darkness
of
that
fog
the
bells
of
the
abbey
sounded
with
musical
and
sweet
strokes
and
all
the
monks
bowed
low
with
their
eyes
closed
then
recovered
themselves
and
entoned
the
laudate
to
the
old
melody
which
is
also
sung
at
notre
dame
des
victoires
at
the
benediction
in
the
evening
then
one
by
one
having
genuflected
before
the
altar
they
went
out
while
durtal
and
the
oblate
returned
to
the
where
father
etienne
was
waiting
for
them
he
said
to
durtal
i
would
not
go
to
bed
without
knowing
how
you
have
borne
the
day
and
as
durtal
thanked
him
assuring
him
that
this
sunday
had
been
very
peaceful
father
etienne
smiled
and
revealed
in
a
word
that
under
their
reserved
attitude
all
at
la
trappe
were
more
interested
in
their
guest
than
he
had
himself
believed
the
reverend
father
abbot
and
the
father
prior
will
be
glad
when
i
give
them
this
answer
said
the
monk
who
wished
durtal
pressing
his
hand
chapter
vii
at
seven
just
as
he
was
preparing
to
eat
his
bread
durtal
encountered
father
etienne
father
he
said
is
tuesday
the
time
of
my
retreat
has
expired
and
i
am
going
how
should
i
order
a
carriage
for
saint
landry
the
monk
smiled
when
the
postman
brings
the
letters
i
can
charge
him
with
the
commission
but
let
us
see
are
you
in
a
great
hurry
to
leave
us
no
but
i
would
not
trespass
listen
since
you
are
so
well
broken
in
to
the
life
at
la
trappe
stay
here
two
days
more
the
father
procurator
must
go
to
settle
a
dispute
at
saint
landry
he
will
take
you
to
the
station
in
our
carriage
so
you
will
avoid
some
expense
and
the
journey
hence
to
the
railroad
will
seem
to
you
less
long
since
there
will
be
two
of
you
durtal
accepted
and
as
it
rained
he
went
up
to
his
room
it
is
strange
he
said
as
he
sat
down
how
impossible
one
finds
it
in
a
cloister
to
read
a
book
one
wants
nothing
one
thinks
of
god
by
himself
and
not
by
the
volumes
which
speak
about
him
mechanically
he
had
taken
up
from
a
heap
of
books
one
in
octavo
which
he
had
found
on
his
table
the
day
he
took
possession
of
his
cell
it
bore
the
title
manresa
or
the
spiritual
exercises
of
ignatius
of
loyola
he
had
already
run
through
the
work
at
paris
and
the
pages
which
he
turned
over
afresh
did
not
change
the
harsh
almost
hostile
opinion
which
he
had
retained
of
this
book
the
fact
is
that
these
exercises
leave
no
initiative
to
the
soul
they
consider
it
as
a
soft
paste
good
to
run
into
a
mould
they
show
it
no
horizon
no
sky
instead
of
trying
to
stretch
it
and
make
it
greater
they
make
it
smaller
deliberately
they
put
it
back
into
the
cases
of
their
wafer
box
nourish
it
only
on
faded
trifles
on
dry
nothings
this
japanese
culture
of
deformed
toes
which
remain
dwarf
this
chinese
deformation
of
children
planted
in
pots
horrified
durtal
who
closed
the
volume
he
opened
another
the
introduction
to
the
devout
life
by
saint
francis
de
sales
certainly
he
found
no
need
to
read
it
again
in
spite
of
its
affectations
and
its
good
nature
at
first
charming
but
which
ends
by
making
you
sick
by
making
the
soul
sticky
with
sweets
with
liqueurs
in
them
and
lollypops
in
a
word
that
work
so
much
praised
by
catholics
was
a
julep
scented
with
bergamot
and
ambergris
it
was
like
a
fine
handkerchief
shaken
in
a
church
in
which
a
musty
smell
of
incense
remained
but
the
man
himself
the
bishop
saint
francis
de
sales
was
suggestive
with
his
name
was
called
up
the
whole
mystical
history
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
durtal
recalled
the
memories
he
had
kept
of
the
religious
life
of
that
time
there
were
then
in
the
church
two
currents
that
of
the
high
mysticism
as
it
was
called
originating
from
saint
teresa
and
saint
john
of
the
cross
and
this
current
was
concentrated
on
marie
guyon
and
another
that
of
temperate
mysticism
of
which
the
adepts
were
saint
francis
de
sales
and
his
friend
the
celebrated
baroness
de
chantal
it
was
naturally
this
second
current
which
triumphed

putting
himself
within
the
reach
of
descending
to
the
level
of
women
of
the
world

moderate
and
proper
jesus
only
dealing
with
the
soul
of
his
creature
just
enough
to
give
it
one
attraction
the
more
this
elegant
jesus
became
all
the
fashion
but
madame
guyon
whose
source
was
above
all
saint
teresa
who
taught
the
mystical
theory
of
love
and
familiar
intercourse
with
heaven
raised
the
opposition
of
the
whole
clergy
who
abominated
mysticism
without
understanding
it
she
exasperated
the
terrible
bossuet
who
accused
her
of
the
fashionable
heresy
molinism
and
quietism
she
refuted
unhappy
as
she
was
this
trouble
without
much
difficulty
but
he
persecuted
her
for
it
none
the
less
he
was
furious
against
her
and
had
her
imprisoned
at
vincennes
revealed
himself
obstinate
surly
and
atrocious
fenelon
who
tried
to
conciliate
these
two
tendencies
in
preparing
a
small
mysticism
neither
too
hot
nor
too
cold
a
little
less
lukewarm
than
that
of
saint
francis
de
sales
and
above
all
things
much
less
ardent
than
that
of
saint
teresa
ended
in
his
turn
by
displeasing
the
cormorant
of
meaux
and
though
he
abandoned
and
denied
madame
de
guyon
whose
friend
he
had
been
for
long
years
he
was
persecuted
and
tracked
down
by
bossuet
condemned
at
rome
and
sent
in
exile
to
cambrai
and
here
durtal
could
not
but
smile
for
he
remembered
the
desolate
complaints
of
his
partisans
weeping
for
this
disgrace
representing
thus
as
a
martyr
this
archbishop
whose
punishment
consisted
in
quitting
his
post
as
courtier
at
versailles
to
go
at
last
and
administer
his
diocese
in
which
he
appeared
till
then
to
have
never
resided
this
mitred
job
who
remained
in
his
misfortune
archbishop
and
duke
of
cambrai
prince
of
the
holy
roman
empire
and
rich
so
unhappy
because
he
was
obliged
to
visit
his
flock
well
shows
the
state
of
the
episcopate
under
the
redundant
reign
of
the
great
king
it
was
a
priesthood
of
financiers
and
valets
only
there
was
at
any
rate
a
certain
attraction
there
was
talent
in
every
case
while
now
bishops
are
not
for
the
most
part
less
intriguing
nor
less
servile
but
they
have
no
longer
either
talent
or
manners
caught
in
part
in
the
fishpond
of
bad
priests
they
show
themselves
ready
for
everything
and
turn
out
to
be
souls
of
old
usurers
low
jobbers
beggars
when
you
press
them
it
is
sad
to
say
it
but
so
it
is
concluded
durtal
as
for
madame
guyon
he
went
on
she
was
neither
an
original
writer
nor
a
saint
she
was
only
an
unwelcome
substitute
for
the
true
mystics
she
was
presuming
and
certainly
lacked
that
humility
which
magnified
saint
teresa
and
saint
clare
but
after
all
she
burst
into
a
flame
she
was
overcome
by
jesus
above
all
she
was
not
a
pious
courtier
a
bigot
softened
by
a
court
like
the
maintenon
after
all
what
a
time
for
religion
it
was
all
its
saints
have
something
formal
and
restricted
wordy
and
cold
which
turns
me
away
from
them
saint
francis
de
sales
saint
vincent
de
paul
saint
chantal
no
i
prefer
saint
francis
of
assisi
saint
bernard
saint
angela
the
mysticism
of
the
seventeenth
century
is
all
the
fashion
with
its
emphatic
and
mean
churches
its
pompous
and
icy
painting
its
solemn
poetry
its
gloomy
prose
but
look
he
said
my
cell
is
still
neither
swept
nor
set
in
order
and
i
am
afraid
that
in
lingering
here
i
may
give
some
trouble
to
father
etienne
it
rains
however
too
hard
to
allow
of
my
walking
in
the
wood
the
simplest
thing
is
to
go
and
read
the
little
office
of
our
lady
in
the
chapel
he
went
down
there
it
was
at
this
hour
almost
empty
the
monks
were
at
work
in
the
fields
or
in
the
factory
two
fathers
only
on
their
knees
before
the
altar
of
our
lady
were
praying
so
absorbedly
that
they
did
not
even
hear
the
opening
of
the
door
and
durtal
who
had
placed
himself
near
them
opposite
the
porch
which
gave
upon
the
high
altar
saw
them
reflected
in
the
sheet
of
glass
placed
before
the
shrine
of
the
blessed
guerric
this
sheet
had
indeed
the
effect
of
a
mirror
and
the
white
fathers
were
in
the
depths
of
it
lived
in
prayers
under
the
table
in
the
very
heart
of
the
altar
and
he
also
appeared
there
in
a
corner
reflected
at
the
back
of
the
shrine
near
the
sacred
remains
of
the
monk
at
one
moment
he
lifted
his
head
and
saw
that
the
round
window
in
the
apse
behind
the
altar
reproduced
on
its
glass
ornamented
with
grey
and
blue
the
marks
engraved
on
the
reverse
of
the
medal
of
saint
benedict
the
first
letters
of
its
imperative
formulas
the
initials
of
its
distiches
it
might
have
been
called
an
immense
clear
medal
sifting
a
pale
light
straining
it
through
prayers
not
allowing
them
to
penetrate
to
the
altar
till
sanctified
and
blessed
by
the
patriarch
and
while
he
was
dreaming
the
clock
struck
the
two
trappists
regained
their
stalls
while
the
others
entered
waiting
thus
in
the
chapel
the
hour
of
sext
had
struck
the
abbot
advanced
durtal
saw
him
again
for
the
first
time
since
their
conversation
he
seemed
less
ill
less
pale
he
marched
majestically
in
his
great
white
cowl
at
the
hood
of
which
hung
a
violet
acorn
and
the
fathers
bowed
kissing
their
sleeve
before
him
he
reached
his
place
which
was
designated
by
a
wooden
cross
standing
before
a
stall
and
all
enfolded
themselves
with
a
great
sign
of
the
cross
bowed
to
the
altar
and
the
feeble
imploring
voice
of
the
old
trappist
rose
deus
in
adjutorium
meum
intende
and
the
office
continued
in
the
monotonous
and
charming
pitch
of
the
doxology
interrupted
by
profound
reverences
large
movements
of
the
arm
lifting
the
sleeve
of
the
cowl
as
it
fell
to
the
ground
to
allow
the
hand
freedom
to
turn
the
pages
when
sext
was
over
durtal
went
to
rejoin
the
oblate
they
found
on
the
table
of
the
refectory
a
little
omelette
leeks
cooked
in
a
sauce
of
flour
and
oil
haricots
and
cheese
it
is
astonishing
said
durtal
how
in
regard
to
mystics
the
world
errs
on
preconceived
ideas
on
the
old
string
phrenologists
declare
that
mystics
have
pointed
skulls
now
here
that
their
form
is
more
visible
than
elsewhere
because
they
are
all
hairless
and
shaven
there
are
no
more
heads
like
eggs
than
anywhere
else
i
looked
this
morning
at
the
shape
of
their
heads
no
two
are
alike
some
are
oval
and
depressed
others
like
a
pear
and
straight
some
have
lumps
on
them
and
some
have
none
and
it
is
just
the
same
with
faces
when
they
are
not
transfigured
by
prayer
they
are
ordinary
if
they
did
not
wear
the
habit
of
their
order
no
one
could
recognize
in
these
trappists
predestined
beings
living
out
of
modern
society
in
the
full
middle
ages
in
absolute
dependence
on
a
god
if
they
have
souls
which
are
not
like
those
of
other
people
they
have
after
all
faces
and
bodies
like
those
of
the
first
comer
all
is
within
said
the
oblate
why
should
elect
souls
be
enclosed
in
fleshly
prisons
different
to
others
this
conversation
which
continued
on
different
points
of
trappist
life
ended
by
turning
on
death
in
a
monastery
and
bruno
revealed
some
details
when
death
is
near
he
said
the
father
abbot
traces
on
the
ground
a
cross
in
blessed
ashes
covered
with
straw
and
the
dying
man
is
placed
on
it
wrapped
in
serge
cloth
the
brothers
recite
near
him
the
prayers
of
the
dying
and
at
the
moment
of
his
death
the
response
sancti
dei
is
chanted
in
choir
the
father
abbot
incenses
the
body
which
is
washed
while
the
monks
sing
the
office
of
the
dead
in
another
room
then
his
regular
habit
is
put
on
the
dead
monk
and
he
is
borne
in
procession
to
the
church
where
he
lies
on
a
stretcher
with
his
face
uncovered
until
the
hour
destined
for
the
funeral
then
on
the
way
to
the
cemetery
the
community
intones
no
longer
the
chant
of
the
dead
the
psalms
of
grief
and
the
sequences
of
regret
but
rather
exitu
israel
de
ægypto
which
is
the
psalm
of
deliverance
the
free
song
of
joy
and
the
trappist
is
buried
without
a
coffin
in
his
robe
of
stuff
his
head
covered
with
his
hood
lastly
during
thirty
days
his
place
remains
empty
in
the
refectory
his
portion
is
served
as
usual
but
the
brother
porter
distributes
it
to
the
poor
ah
the
happiness
to
die
thus
said
the
oblate
as
he
ended
for
if
one
dies
after
having
honestly
fulfilled
one
task
in
the
order
one
is
assured
of
eternal
happiness
according
to
the
promises
made
by
our
lord
to
saint
benedict
and
to
saint
bernard
the
rain
is
over
said
durtal
i
should
like
to
visit
that
little
chapel
at
the
end
of
the
park
of
which
you
spoke
to
me
the
other
day
which
is
the
shortest
way
to
reach
it
bruno
told
him
the
way
and
durtal
went
off
rolling
a
cigarette
to
gain
the
great
pond
thence
he
struck
a
path
to
the
left
and
mounted
a
lane
of
trees
he
slipped
on
the
wet
ground
and
got
on
with
difficulty
at
last
however
he
gained
a
clump
of
chestnuts
which
he
skirted
behind
these
rose
a
dwarf
tower
topped
by
a
very
small
dome
pierced
by
a
door
to
the
left
and
right
of
this
door
on
sockets
where
ornaments
of
the
romanesque
epoch
still
were
seen
under
the
velvety
crust
of
moss
two
stone
angels
were
still
standing
they
belonged
evidently
to
the
burgundian
school
with
their
big
round
heads
their
hair
puffed
and
divided
into
waves
their
fat
faces
with
noses
their
solid
draperies
with
hard
folds
they
also
came
from
the
ruins
of
the
old
cloister
but
the
interior
of
the
chapel
was
unfortunately
thoroughly
modern
it
was
so
small
that
the
feet
of
him
who
knelt
at
the
altar
almost
touched
the
wall
at
the
entrance
in
a
niche
veiled
by
white
gauze
a
virgin
smiled
with
extended
hands
she
had
blue
plaster
eyes
and
cheeks
she
was
wearisome
in
her
insignificance
but
her
sanctuary
retained
the
warmth
of
places
always
shut
up
the
walls
hung
with
red
calico
were
dusted
the
floor
was
swept
and
the
holy
water
basins
full
superb
tea
roses
flourished
in
pots
between
the
candelabra
durtal
then
understood
why
he
had
so
often
seen
bruno
walking
in
this
direction
with
flowers
in
his
hand
he
was
going
to
pray
in
this
place
which
he
loved
no
doubt
because
it
was
isolated
in
the
profound
solitude
of
this
trappist
monastery
excellent
man
cried
durtal
thinking
over
the
affectionate
services
the
fraternal
care
the
oblate
had
had
for
him
and
he
added
he
is
a
happy
man
too
for
he
is
and
lives
so
placidly
here
and
indeed
he
went
on
where
is
the
good
of
striving
if
not
against
oneself
to
agitate
oneself
for
money
for
glory
to
conduct
oneself
so
as
to
keep
others
down
and
gain
adulation
from
them
how
vain
a
task
only
the
church
in
decking
the
temporary
altars
of
the
liturgical
year
in
forcing
the
seasons
to
follow
step
by
step
the
life
of
christ
has
known
how
to
trace
for
us
a
plan
of
necessary
occupations
of
useful
ends
she
has
given
us
the
means
of
walking
always
side
by
side
with
jesus
to
live
day
by
day
with
the
gospels
for
christians
she
has
made
time
the
messenger
of
sorrows
and
the
herald
of
joys
she
has
entrusted
to
the
year
the
part
of
servant
of
the
new
testament
the
zealous
emissary
of
worship
and
durtal
reflected
on
the
cycle
of
the
liturgy
which
begins
on
the
first
day
of
the
religious
year
with
advent
then
turns
with
an
insensible
movement
on
itself
till
it
returns
again
to
its
to
the
time
when
the
church
prepares
by
penitence
and
prayer
to
celebrate
christmas
and
turning
over
his
seeing
the
extraordinary
circle
of
offices
he
thought
of
that
prodigious
jewel
that
crown
of
king
recceswinthe
preserved
in
the
museum
of
cluny
the
liturgical
year
was
like
it
studded
with
crystals
and
jewels
by
its
admirable
canticles
and
its
fervent
hymns
set
in
the
very
gold
of
benedictions
and
vespers
it
seemed
that
the
church
had
substituted
for
that
crown
of
thorns
with
which
the
jews
had
surrounded
the
temples
of
the
saviour
the
truly
royal
crown
of
the
proper
of
the
seasons
the
only
one
which
was
chiselled
in
a
metal
precious
enough
with
art
pure
enough
to
dare
to
place
itself
on
the
brow
of
a
god
and
the
grand
lapidary
had
begun
his
work
by
incrusting
in
this
diadem
of
offices
the
hymn
of
saint
ambrose
and
the
invocation
taken
from
the
old
testament
the
rorate
coeli
that
melodious
chant
of
expectation
and
regret
that
obscure
gem
the
lustre
declares
itself
then
when
after
each
of
its
stanzas
rises
the
solemn
prayer
of
the
patriarchs
calling
for
the
presence
of
christ
and
the
four
sundays
of
advent
disappeared
with
the
turned
pages
of
the
the
night
of
the
nativity
was
come
after
the
jesu
redemptor
of
vespers
the
old
portuguese
chant
the
adeste
fideles
arose
at
benediction
from
every
lip
it
was
a
sequence
of
a
truly
charming
simplicity
an
old
carving
wherein
defiled
the
shepherds
and
the
kings
to
a
popular
air
appropriate
to
great
marches
apt
to
charm
to
aid
by
the
somewhat
military
rhythm
of
its
steps
the
long
lines
of
the
faithful
quitting
their
cottages
to
go
to
the
distant
churches
in
the
towns
and
imperceptibly
like
the
year
in
an
invisible
rotation
the
circle
turned
and
stopped
at
the
feast
of
the
holy
innocents
where
there
flourished
out
like
a
flower
from
a
on
a
shoot
culled
from
a
soil
irrigated
by
the
blood
of
lambs
this
sequence
red
and
smelling
of
roses
the
salvate
flores
martyrum
of
prudentius
the
crown
moved
again
and
the
hymn
of
the
epiphany
the
crudelis
herodes
of
sedudius
appeared
in
its
turn
now
the
sundays
grew
heavy
the
violet
sundays
when
the
gloria
in
excelsis
is
no
more
heard
when
the
audi
benigne
of
saint
ambrose
is
chanted
and
the
miserere
that
psalm
which
is
perhaps
the
most
perfect
masterpiece
which
the
church
has
ever
drawn
from
her
of
plain
chants
it
was
lent
when
the
amethysts
fade
in
the
moist
grey
of
onyxes
in
the
embrowned
white
of
quartz
and
the
magnificent
invocation
attende
domine
rose
beneath
the
arches
sprung
like
the
rorate
coeli
from
the
sequences
of
the
old
testament
this
humble
and
contrite
chant
enumerating
the
deserved
punishments
of
sins
became
if
not
more
sorrowful
at
all
events
more
grave
and
more
pressing
when
it
confirmed
when
it
resumed
in
the
initial
stanza
of
its
burthen
the
avowal
of
shame
already
confessed
and
suddenly
on
this
crown
there
burst
out
after
the
expiring
fires
of
lent
the
flaming
ruby
of
the
passion
on
the
upturned
yellow
of
the
sky
a
red
cross
was
raised
while
majestic
shouts
and
despairing
cries
proclaimed
the
fruit
of
the
tree
and
the
vexilla
regis
was
again
repeated
the
following
sunday
at
the
feast
of
palms
which
joined
to
that
sequence
of
fortunatus
the
green
hymn
which
it
accompanied
with
a
silky
noise
of
palms
the
gloria
laus
et
honor
of
theodulph
then
the
fires
of
precious
stones
grew
grey
and
died
to
the
glowing
coals
of
gems
succeeded
the
dead
cinders
of
obsidians
black
stones
scarcely
swelling
without
a
gleam
above
the
tarnished
gold
of
their
mountings
one
entered
no
holy
week
everywhere
the
pange
lingua
and
the
stabat
mater
wailed
under
the
arches
and
then
came
the
tenebræ
the
lamentations
and
the
psalms
whose
knell
shook
the
flame
of
the
brown
waxen
tapers
and
after
each
halt
at
the
end
of
each

the

made
at

in

the

after

the

according

matthew
repeats
as
well
as

gospel

terrible

to

differentiated
by
special
sequences
by
special
proses
of
which
some
are
very
simple
like
those
stanzas
made
in
honour
of
the
nativity
of
saint
john
the
baptist
by
paul
the
deacon
there
still
remains
all

the
knell
in
triplets
of
the
iræ
which
resounds
on
the
day
set
apart
for
the
commemoration
of
the
dead
what
an
immense
fund
of
poetry
what
an
incomparable
estate
of
art
the
church
possesses
he
cried
closing
his
book
and
many
memories
rose
for
him
at
this
excursion
into
his
on
how
many
evenings
had
the
sadness
of
life
been
dissipated
in
listening
to
these
proses
chanted
in
the
churches
he
thought
over
again
of
the
suppliant
voice
of
advent
and
recalled
one
evening
when
he
had
wandered
under
a
fine
rain
along
the
quays
he
had
been
driven
from
home
by
ignoble
visions
and
at
the
same
time
had
been
harassed
by
the
increasing
disgust
of
his
vices
he
had
ended
by
being
brought
up
against
his
will
at
gervais
in
the
chapel
of
the
virgin
some
poor
women
were
prostrate
he
had
knelt
tired
and
dazed
his
soul
so
ill
at
ease
that
he
slumbered
without
power
to
wake
himself
some
men
and
boys
of
the
choir
were
installed
in
the
chapel
with
two
or
three
priests
they
had
lighted
candles
and
the
voice
light
and
sustained
of
a
child
had
in
the
dark
of
the
church
chanted
the
long
antiphons
of
the
rorate
in
the
state
of
overwhelming
sadness
in
which
he
was
stagnant
durtal
felt
himself
open
and
bleeding
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
then
a
voice
older
and
less
trembling
which
understood
the
words
it
said
narrated
ingenuously
almost
without
confusion
to
the
just
one
peccavimus
et
facti
sumus
tanquam
immundus
nos
and
durtal
took
up
these
words
and
spelt
them
over
in
terror
thinking
ah
yes
we
have
sinned
and
become
like
the
leprous
o
lord
and
the
chant
continued
and
in
his
turn
the
most
high
borrowed
that
same
innocent
organ
of
childhood
to
declare
to
man
his
pity
and
to
confirm
to
him
the
pardon
assured
by
the
coming
of
the
son
and
the
evening
had
ended
by
the
benediction
in
plain
chant
in
the
midst
of
the
silence
and
prostration
of
unhappy
women
durtal
remembered
how
he
left
the
church
refreshed
freed
from
his
hauntings
and
he
had
gone
away
in
the
drizzling
rain
surprised
that
the
way
was
so
short
humming
the
rorate
of
which
the
air
had
taken
possession
of
him
ending
by
seeing
in
it
the
personal
touch
of
a
kindly
unknown
and
there
were
other
evenings
the
octave
of
the
feast
of
all
souls
at
sulpice
and
at
thomas
aquinas
where
after
the
vespers
of
the
dead
they
brought
out
again
the
old
sequence
which
has
disappeared
from
the
roman
breviary
the
lanquentilus
in
purgatorio
this
church
was
the
only
one
in
paris
which
had
retained
these
pages
of
the
gallican
hymnal
and
had
them
sung
by
two
basses
without
a
choir
but
these
singers
so
poor
as
a
rule
no
doubt
were
fond
of
this
air
for
if
they
did
not
sing
it
with
art
at
least
they
put
a
little
soul
into
its
delivery
and
this
invocation
to
the
madonna
in
which
she
was
adjured
to
save
the
souls
in
purgatory
was
as
sorrowful
as
the
souls
themselves
and
so
melancholy
so
languid
that
the
surroundings
were
forgotten
the
ugliness
of
that
sanctuary
of
which
the
choir
was
a
theatre
scene
surrounded
by
closed
and
garnished
with
lustres
one
might
think
oneself
for
a
few
moments
far
from
paris
far
from
that
population
of
devout
women
and
servant
girls
which
attend
that
place
in
the
evening
ah
the
church
he
said
to
himself
as
he
descended
the
path
which
led
to
the
great
pond
what
a
mother
of
art
is
she
and
suddenly
the
noise
of
a
body
falling
into
the
water
interrupted
his
reflections
he
looked
behind
the
hedge
of
reeds
and
saw
nothing
but
great
circles
running
on
the
water
and
all
at
once
in
one
of
these
rings
a
small
head
appeared
holding
a
fish
in
its
mouth
the
beast
raised
itself
a
little
out
of
the
water
showed
a
thin
body
covered
with
fur
and
gazed
on
durtal
quietly
with
its
little
black
eyes
then
in
a
flash
it
passed
the
distance
which
separated
it
from
the
bank
and
disappeared
under
the
grasses
it
is
the
otter
he
said
to
himself
remembering
the
discussion
at
table
between
the
stranger
priest
and
the
oblate
and
he
went
to
gain
the
other
pond
when
he
encountered
father
etienne
he
told
him
his
adventure
impossible
cried
the
monk
no
one
has
ever
seen
the
otter
you
must
have
mistaken
it
for
a
water
rat
or
some
other
animal
for
that
beast
for
which
we
have
watched
for
years
is
invisible
durtal
gave
him
a
description
of
it
it
is
certainly
the
otter
admitted
the
surprised
it
was
evident
that
this
otter
lived
in
the
pond
in
a
legendary
state
in
monotonous
lives
in
days
like
those
in
a
cloister
it
took
the
proportions
of
a
fabulous
subject
of
an
event
whereof
the
mystery
would
occupy
intervals
seized
between
prayers
and
offices
we
must
point
out
to
bruno
the
exact
spot
where
you
remarked
it
for
he
will
begin
to
hunt
it
again
said
father
etienne
after
a
silence
but
how
can
it
trouble
you
in
eating
your
fish
since
you
do
not
angle
for
them
i
beg
your
pardon
we
fish
for
them
to
send
them
to
the
archbishop
answered
the
monk
who
went
on
still
it
is
very
strange
that
you
saw
the
beast
when
i
leave
this
thought
durtal
they
will
certainly
speak
of
me
as
the
gentleman
who
saw
the
otter
while
talking
they
had
arrived
at
the
cross
pond
look
said
the
father
pointing
out
the
swan
who
rose
in
a
fury
beat
his
wings
and
hissed
what
is
the
matter
with
him
the
matter
is
that
the
white
hue
of
my
habit
infuriates
him
ah
and
why
i
do
not
know
perhaps
he
wants
to
be
the
only
one
who
is
white
here
he
spares
the
lay
brothers
while
as
for
a
father
wait
you
will
see
and
the
walked
quietly
towards
the
swan
come
he
said
to
the
angry
creature
who
splashed
him
with
water
and
he
held
out
his
hand
which
the
swan
snapped
see
said
the
monk
showing
the
mark
of
a
red
pinch
printed
on
the
flesh
and
he
smiled
holding
his
hand
and
quitted
durtal
who
asked
himself
whether
in
acting
thus
the
trappist
were
not
wishing
to
inflict
on
himself
some
corporal
punishment
to
atone
for
some
distraction
the
evening
before
some
peccadillo
that
stroke
of
the
beak
must
have
pinched
him
horribly
for
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
how
could
he
expose
himself
with
joy
to
such
a
bite
and
he
remembered
that
one
day
at
the
office
of
none
one
of
the
young
monks
made
a
mistake
in
the
tone
of
an
antiphon
at
the
moment
that
the
office
ended
he
knelt
before
the
altar
then
he
lay
his
whole
length
on
the
tiles
on
his
face
his
mouth
pressed
on
the
ground
till
the
stroke
of
the
prior
bell
gave
him
the
order
to
get
up
this
was
a
voluntary
punishment
for
a
negligence
committed
a
forgetfulness
who
knows
whether
father
etienne
did
not
in
his
turn
punish
himself
for
a
thought
he
deemed
to
border
on
sin
in
getting
himself
thus
pinched
he
consulted
the
oblate
on
the
point
in
the
evening
but
bruno
contented
himself
with
a
smile
without
answering
and
when
durtal
spoke
to
him
of
his
speedy
departure
for
paris
the
old
man
shook
his
head
considering
he
said
the
fear
and
the
discomfort
that
communion
caused
you
you
would
act
wisely
if
you
approach
the
holy
table
immediately
on
your
return
and
seeing
that
durtal
did
not
reply
but
hung
his
head
believe
a
man
who
has
known
these
trials
if
you
do
not
force
yourself
while
you
are
still
under
the
warm
impression
of
la
trappe
you
will
float
between
desire
and
regret
without
advancing
you
will
be
ingenious
in
discovering
excuses
for
not
making
your
confession
you
will
try
to
think
it
impossible
to
find
in
paris
an
abbé
who
understands
you
now
allow
me
to
assure
you
nothing
is
more
false
if
you
desire
an
expert
and
easy
confidant
go
to
the
jesuits
if
you
wish
above
all
a
priest
go
to
sulpice
you
will
find
there
honest
and
intelligent
ecclesiastics
excellent
hearts
in
paris
where
the
clergy
of
the
parishes
are
so
mixed
they
are
at
the
top
of
the
basket
of
the
priesthood
and
as
may
be
imagined
they
form
a
community
live
in
cells
do
not
dine
out
and
as
the
sulpician
rule
forbids
them
to
aspire
to
honours
or
places
they
do
not
run
the
chance
of
becoming
bad
priests
by
ambition
do
you
know
them
no
but
to
resolve
that
question
which
in
fact
constantly
troubles
me
i
count
on
a
priest
whom
i
often
see
on
the
very
man
who
in
fact
sent
me
into
this
trappist
monastery
and
that
he
went
on
makes
me
remember
and
he
rose
to
go
to
compline
that
i
have
as
yet
forgotten
to
write
to
him
it
is
true
that
now
it
is
too
late
i
should
arrive
at
his
house
almost
as
soon
as
my
letter
it
is
strange
but
by
force
of
walking
in
one
own
by
force
of
living
to
oneself
the
days
run
by
and
there
is
no
time
to
do
anything
here
chapter
viii
he
had
hoped
for
his
last
day
at
la
trappe
a
morning
of
quiet
when
his
mind
might
lounge
a
mixture
of
spiritual
siesta
and
of
working
charmed
by
a
round
of
offices
and
not
at
all
that
the
idea
persistent
and
obstinate
that
he
must
quit
the
monastery
next
day
would
spoil
all
the
pleasures
he
had
promised
himself
now
that
he
had
no
longer
to
cleanse
himself
and
pass
under
the
winnowing
of
confession
to
present
himself
for
the
communion
in
the
morning
he
remained
irresolute
not
knowing
any
longer
how
to
occupy
his
time
terrified
by
the
recommencement
of
that
life
of
the
world
which
would
upset
all
the
barriers
of
forgetfulness
and
would
get
at
him
at
once
above
all
the
broken
defences
of
the
cloister
like
a
captured
animal
he
began
to
rub
against
the
bars
of
his
cage
made
the
tour
of
the
enclosure
filling
his
sight
with
those
places
where
he
had
tasted
hours
so
kindly
and
so
cruel
he
felt
in
himself
a
shaking
of
the
ground
a
disturbance
of
soul
an
absolute
discouragement
before
the
prospect
of
into
his
habitual
existence
of
mixing
himself
anew
with
the
coming
and
going
of
men
and
he
experienced
at
the
same
time
a
great
fatigue
of
brain
he
dragged
himself
along
the
walks
in
a
state
of
complete
discomfort
in
one
of
those
attacks
of
religious
spleen
which
determine
while
they
last
during
years
the
tædium
vitæ
of
the
cloisters
he
had
a
horror
of
any
life
but
this
and
the
soul
overwrought
by
prayers
was
failing
in
a
body
insufficiently
rested
and
it
had
no
further
desire
asked
only
to
be
let
alone
to
sleep
to
fall
into
one
of
those
states
of
torpor
in
which
everything
becomes
indifferent
in
which
one
ends
by
losing
consciousness
gently
by
being
stifled
without
suffering
he
might
well
to
on
him
as
a
consolation
promise
himself
to
assist
in
paris
at
the
offices
of
the
benedictine
nuns
that
he
would
keep
himself
on
the
outskirts
of
society
to
himself
and
he
was
at
once
obliged
to
answer
that
these
subterfuges
are
impossible
that
the
very
movement
of
the
town
is
against
all
decoys
that
isolation
in
a
chamber
is
in
no
degree
like
the
solitude
of
a
cell
that
masses
celebrated
in
a
chapel
open
to
the
public
can
not
be
likened
to
the
private
offices
of
the
trappists
then
what
is
the
good
of
trying
to
misunderstand
it
is
with
the
soul
as
with
the
body
which
is
better
on
the
sea
shore
or
in
the
mountains
than
shut
up
in
a
town
there
is
a
better
spiritual
air
even
at
paris
in
certain
religious
quarters
of
the
left
bank
than
in
the
districts
situated
on
the
other
bank
more
lively
in
certain
churches
more
pure
for
example
at
notre
dame
des
victoires
than
in
churches
such
as
la
trinité
and
the
madeleine
but
the
monastery
was
as
it
were
the
true
shore
and
high
plateau
of
the
soul
there
the
atmosphere
was
balsamic
strength
returned
lost
appetite
for
god
was
there
recovered
there
was
health
succeeding
weakness
a
regimen
fortified
and
sustained
instead
of
languor
and
the
restricted
exercises
of
the
towns
the
conviction
that
no
trickery
was
possible
to
him
at
paris
brought
him
to
the
ground
he
wandered
from
cell
to
chapel
from
chapel
to
woods
awaiting
the
dinner
hour
with
impatience
in
order
to
be
able
to
speak
to
someone
for
in
his
disorder
a
new
need
arose
for
more
than
a
week
he
had
spent
the
whole
afternoon
without
opening
his
lips
he
did
not
suffer
from
it
was
even
satisfied
with
his
silence
but
since
he
was
pressed
by
this
idea
of
departure
he
could
not
keep
silence
any
longer
thought
aloud
in
the
walks
to
assuage
the
sensations
of
his
swelling
heart
that
stifled
him
bruno
was
too
sagacious
not
to
guess
the
uneasiness
of
his
companion
who
became
by
turns
taciturn
and
over
talkative
during
the
meal
he
made
however
as
though
he
saw
nothing
but
after
he
had
said
grace
he
disappeared
and
durtal
who
was
strolling
near
the
great
pond
was
surprised
to
see
him
coming
in
his
direction
with
father
etienne
they
greeted
him
and
the
trappist
with
a
smile
proposed
to
him
if
he
had
made
no
other
plan
to
pass
his
time
in
visiting
the
convent
and
especially
the
library
which
the
father
prior
would
be
delighted
to
show
him
if
convenient
to
me
i
shall
be
delighted
cried
durtal
all
three
returned
towards
the
abbey
the
monk
lifted
the
latch
of
a
little
door
fashioned
in
a
wall
near
the
church
and
durtal
entered
a
minute
cemetery
planted
with
wooden
crosses
on
grass
graves
there
was
no
inscription
no
flower
in
this
enclosure
which
they
traversed
the
monk
pushed
another
door
which
opened
on
a
long
corridor
smelling
of
rats
at
the
end
of
this
gallery
durtal
recognized
the
staircase
he
had
ascended
one
morning
for
his
confession
in
the
room
they
left
it
on
their
right
turned
into
another
gallery
and
the
led
them
into
an
immense
hall
pierced
by
high
windows
decorated
with
eighteenth
century
and
it
was
furnished
only
with
benches
and
stalls
above
which
was
a
single
chair
sculptured
and
painted
with
abbatial
arms
which
marked
the
place
of
dom
anselm
oh
this
has
nothing
monastic
said
father
etienne
designating
the
profane
pictures
on
the
walls
we
have
kept
just
as
it
was
the
of
this
old
chateau
but
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
this
decoration
hardly
pleases
us
and
what
takes
place
in
this
hall
well
we
meet
here
after
mass
the
chapter
opens
by
reading
the
martyrology
followed
by
the
concluding
prayers
of
prime
then
we
read
a
passage
from
the
rule
and
the
father
abbot
comments
on
it
lastly
we
practise
the
exercise
of
humility
that
is
to
say
that
whoever
among
us
has
committed
any
fault
against
the
rule
prostrates
himself
and
avows
it
before
his
brethren
they
went
thence
to
the
refectory
this
room
had
also
a
high
ceiling
but
was
smaller
and
garnished
with
tables
in
form
of
a
a
kind
of
large
cruets
each
containing
two
of
wine
and
water
separated
by
a
water
bottle
and
before
them
instead
of
glasses
cups
of
brown
earthenware
with
two
handles
were
placed
at
equal
distances
the
monk
explained
that
these
sham
cruets
with
three
branches
indicated
the
place
of
two
covers
each
monk
having
a
right
to
his
half
bottle
of
drink
and
partaking
with
his
neighbour
the
water
in
the
bottle
this
pulpit
said
father
etienne
pointing
out
a
large
wooden
box
fixed
against
the
wall
is
destined
for
the
reader
of
the
week
the
father
who
reads
during
the
meal
how
long
does
the
meal
last
just
half
an
hour
yes
and
the
cookery
which
we
eat
is
delicate
in
comparison
with
that
which
is
served
to
the
monks
said
the
oblate
i
should
lie
if
i
were
to
affirm
that
we
make
good
cheer
answered
the
do
you
know
that
the
hardest
thing
to
bear
in
the
earlier
time
especially
is
the
want
of
seasoning
in
our
dishes
pepper
and
spices
are
forbidden
by
our
rule
and
as
no
has
place
on
our
table
we
swallow
our
food
just
as
it
is
and
it
is
for
the
most
part
scarcely
salted
on
certain
days
in
summer
when
one
sweats
in
big
drops
this
becomes
almost
impossible
the
gorge
rises
yet
one
must
begin
upon
this
warm
paste
and
at
least
swallow
a
sufficient
quantity
not
to
give
out
before
the
next
day
we
look
at
each
other
discouraged
unable
to
get
any
further
there
is
not
another
word
to
define
our
dinner
in
the
month
of
august
it
is
a
punishment
and
all
the
father
abbot
the
prior
the
fathers
the
brethren
have
the
same
food
all
now
come
and
see
the
dormitory
they
ascended
to
the
first
floor
an
immense
corridor
furnished
like
a
stable
with
wooden
boxes
extended
before
them
closed
at
each
end
by
a
door
this
is
our
lodging
said
the
monk
as
he
stopped
before
one
of
these
cases
cards
were
placed
on
them
affixing
the
name
of
each
monk
and
the
first
bore
a
ticket
with
this
inscription
the
father
abbot
durtal
felt
the
bed
against
one
of
the
two
walls
it
was
as
rough
as
a
carding
comb
and
as
biting
as
a
file
it
was
composed
of
a
simple
quilted
paillasse
extended
on
a
plank
no
sheets
but
a
prison
coverlet
of
grey
wool
a
sack
of
straw
instead
of
pillows
god
it
is
very
hard
said
durtal
and
the
monk
laughed
our
habits
soften
the
roughness
of
this
straw
mattress
he
said
for
our
rule
does
not
allow
us
to
undress
we
may
only
take
off
our
shoes
therefore
we
sleep
entirely
clad
our
head
wrapped
in
our
hood
and
it
must
be
cold
in
this
corridor
swept
by
all
the
winds
added
durtal
no
doubt
the
winter
is
rough
here
but
it
is
not
that
season
which
alarms
us
we
live
pretty
well
even
without
fire
in
time
of
frost
but
the
summer
if
you
knew
what
it
is
to
wake
in
habits
still
steeped
in
sweat
not
dried
since
the
evening
before
it
is
terrible
then
though
because
of
the
great
heat
we
have
often
hardly
slept
we
must
before
dawn
jump
out
of
bed
and
begin
at
once
the
great
night
office
the
vigils
which
last
at
least
two
hours
even
after
twenty
years
of
trappist
life
one
can
not
but
suffer
at
that
getting
up
in
chapel
you
fight
against
sleep
which
crushes
you
you
sleep
while
you
hear
a
verse
chanted
you
strive
to
keep
awake
in
order
to
be
able
to
chant
another
and
fall
asleep
again
one
ought
to
be
able
to
turn
the
key
on
thought
and
one
is
incapable
of
it
truly
i
assure
you
that
even
beyond
the
corporal
fatigue
which
explains
that
state
in
the
morning
there
is
then
an
aggression
of
the
demon
an
incessant
temptation
to
make
us
recite
the
office
badly
and
you
all
undergo
this
strife
all
and
this
does
not
hinder
concluded
the
monk
whose
face
was
radiant
this
does
not
hinder
us
from
being
very
happy
here
because
all
these
trials
are
nothing
beside
the
deep
and
intimate
joys
which
our
good
god
gives
us
ah
he
is
a
generous
master
he
pays
us
a
for
our
poor
sorrows
as
they
spoke
they
had
passed
through
the
corridor
and
had
arrived
at
its
other
end
the
monk
opened
the
door
and
durtal
was
astounded
to
find
himself
in
a
vestibule
just
opposite
his
own
cell
i
did
not
think
he
said
that
i
was
living
so
near
you
this
house
is
a
regular
labyrinth
but
bruno
will
take
you
to
the
library
where
the
father
prior
is
waiting
for
you
for
i
must
go
to
my
business
we
shall
meet
presently
he
said
with
a
smile
the
library
was
situated
on
the
other
side
of
the
staircase
by
which
durtal
reached
his
chamber
it
was
large
furnished
with
shelves
from
top
to
bottom
occupied
in
the
middle
by
a
sort
of
counter
table
on
which
also
were
spread
rows
of
books
father
maximin
said
to
durtal
we
are
not
very
rich
but
at
any
rate
we
possess
tools
for
work
fairly
complete
on
theology
and
the
monography
of
the
cloisters
you
have
superb
volumes
cried
durtal
who
looked
at
magnificent
folios
in
splendid
bindings
with
armorial
bearings
wait
here
are
the
works
of
saint
bernard
in
a
fine
edition
and
the
monk
presented
to
durtal
enormous
volumes
printed
in
heavy
letters
on
crackling
paper
when
i
think
that
i
promised
myself
to
make
acquaintance
with
saint
bernard
in
this
very
abbey
which
he
founded
and
here
i
am
on
the
eve
of
my
departure
and
have
read
nothing
you
do
not
know
his
works
yes
scattered
fragments
of
his
sermons
and
of
his
letters
i
have
run
through
some
of
his
works
but
that
is
all
he
is
our
chief
master
here
but
he
is
not
the
only
one
of
our
ancestors
in
saint
benedict
whom
the
convent
possesses
said
the
monk
with
a
certain
pride
see
and
he
pointed
out
on
the
shelves
some
heavy
folios
here
gregory
the
great
bede
peter
damian
anselm
and
your
friends
are
there
he
said
following
durtal
with
a
glance
as
he
read
the
titles
of
the
volumes
teresa
john
of
the
cross
magdalen
of
pazzi
angela
and
she
who
like
sister
emmerich
dictated
her
conversations
with
jesus
during
her
ecstasy
and
the
prior
took
from
the
range
of
books
in
octavo
the
dialogues
of
saint
catherine
of
siena
that
dominican
nun
is
terrible
for
the
priests
of
her
time
the
monk
went
on
she
insists
on
their
misdeeds
reproaches
them
roundly
with
selling
the
holy
spirit
with
practising
sortilege
and
with
using
the
sacrament
to
compose
evil
charms
and
there
are
besides
the
disorderly
vices
of
which
she
accuses
them
in
the
series
concerning
the
sin
of
the
flesh
added
the
oblate
certainly
she
does
not
mince
her
words
but
she
had
the
right
to
take
up
that
tone
and
menace
in
the
name
of
the
lord
for
she
was
truly
inspired
by
him
her
doctrine
was
drawn
from
divine
sources
ejus
infusa
non
acquisita
says
the
church
in
the
bull
of
her
canonization
her
dialogues
are
admirable
the
pages
in
which
god
exposes
the
holy
frauds
which
he
sometimes
uses
to
recall
men
to
good
the
passages
in
which
she
treats
of
the
monastic
life
of
that
barque
which
possesses
three
ropes
chastity
obedience
and
poverty
and
which
faces
the
tempest
under
the
conduct
of
the
holy
spirit
are
delightful
she
reveals
herself
in
her
work
the
pupil
of
the
disciple
and
of
saint
thomas
aquinas
one
might
believe
that
one
heard
the
angel
of
the
school
paraphrasing
the
last
of
the
evangelists
yes
said
the
oblate
striking
in
if
saint
catherine
of
siena
does
not
give
herself
to
the
high
speculations
of
mysticism
if
she
does
not
analyze
like
saint
teresa
the
mysteries
of
divine
love
nor
trace
the
itinerary
of
souls
destined
to
the
perfect
life
she
reflects
directly
at
least
the
conversations
of
heaven
she
calls
she
loves
you
have
read
sir
her
treatises
on
discretion
and
prayer
no
i
have
read
saint
catherine
of
genoa
but
the
books
of
saint
catherine
of
siena
have
never
fallen
into
my
hands
and
what
do
you
think
of
this
collection
durtal
looked
at
the
title
and
made
a
face
i
see
that
suso
hardly
delights
you
i
should
tell
a
lie
if
i
assured
you
that
the
dissertations
of
this
dominican
pleased
me
first
however
illuminated
the
man
may
be
he
does
not
attract
me
without
speaking
of
the
frenzy
of
his
penances
what
scrupulousness
of
devotion
and
narrowness
of
piety
was
his
think
that
he
could
not
decide
on
drinking
till
he
had
first
as
a
preliminary
divided
his
beverage
into
five
parts
he
thought
thus
to
honour
the
five
wounds
of
the
saviour
and
moreover
he
swallowed
his
last
mouthful
in
two
gulps
to
call
up
before
himself
the
water
and
the
blood
which
flowed
from
the
side
of
the
word
no
these
sort
of
things
would
never
enter
into
my
head
i
would
never
admit
that
such
practices
would
glorify
christ
and
remark
well
that
this
love
of
pounding
things
small
this
passion
for
small
blessings
is
found
in
all
his
work
his
god
is
so
difficult
to
content
so
scrupulous
so
meddling
that
no
one
would
ever
get
to
heaven
if
they
believed
what
he
said
this
god
of
his
is
the
of
eternity
the
miser
of
paradise
on
the
whole
suso
expands
himself
in
impetuous
discourses
on
trifles
then
what
with
his
insipid
allegories
his
morose
on
the
nine
rocks
knocks
me
down
you
will
however
admit
that
his
study
on
the
union
of
the
soul
is
substantial
and
that
the
of
the
eternal
wisdom
which
he
composed
is
worth
reading
i
can
not
say
father
i
do
not
now
remember
that
office
but
i
recollect
tolerably
well
the
treatise
on
with
god
it
seems
to
me
more
interesting
than
the
rest
but
you
will
admit
that
it
is
very
short
and
then
saint
teresa
has
also
elucidated
that
question
of
human
renunciation
and
divine
fruition
and
hang
it
then
come
said
the
oblate
with
a
smile
i
give
up
the
attempt
to
make
you
a
fervent
reader
of
the
good
suso
for
us
said
father
maximin
if
we
had
a
little
time
to
work
this
ought
to
be
the
leaven
of
our
meditations
the
subject
of
our
reading
and
he
took
down
a
folio
which
contained
the
works
of
saint
hildegarde
abbess
of
the
convent
of
rupertsberg
she
you
see
is
the
great
prophetess
of
the
new
testament
never
since
the
visions
of
saint
john
at
patmos
has
the
holy
spirit
communicated
to
an
earthly
being
with
such
fulness
and
light
in
her
she
predicts
protestantism
and
the
captivity
of
the
vatican
in
her
or
knowledge
of
the
ways
of
the
lord
which
was
edited
according
to
her
recital
by
a
monk
of
the
convent
of
saint
désibode
she
interprets
the
symbols
of
the
scriptures
and
even
the
nature
of
the
elements
she
also
wrote
a
diligent
commentary
on
our
rules
and
enthusiastic
pages
on
sacred
music
on
literature
on
art
which
she
defines
admirably
a
reminiscence
of
a
primitive
condition
from
which
we
have
fallen
since
eden
unfortunately
to
understand
her
it
is
necessary
to
give
oneself
to
minute
researches
and
patient
studies
her
apocalyptic
style
has
something
retractile
which
retreats
and
shuts
itself
up
all
the
more
when
one
will
open
it
i
am
well
aware
that
i
am
losing
my
little
latin
said
bruno
what
a
pity
there
is
not
a
translation
of
her
works
with
glosses
to
help
they
are
untranslatable
said
the
father
who
went
on
saint
hildegarde
is
with
saint
bernard
one
of
the
purest
glories
of
the
family
of
saint
benedict
how
predestinate
was
that
virgin
who
was
inundated
with
interior
light
at
the
age
of
three
and
died
at
having
lived
all
her
life
in
the
cloister
and
add
that
she
was
as
a
permanent
state
prophetical
cried
the
oblate
she
is
like
no
other
woman
saint
all
in
her
is
astonishing
even
the
way
in
which
god
addresses
her
for
he
forgets
that
she
is
a
woman
and
calls
her
and
she
added
the
prior
employs
when
she
wishes
to
designate
herself
the
singular
expression
paltry
form
but
here
is
another
writer
who
is
dear
to
us
and
he
showed
durtal
the
two
volumes
of
saint
gertrude
she
is
again
one
of
our
great
nuns
an
abbess
truly
benedictine
in
the
exact
sense
of
the
word
for
she
caused
the
holy
scriptures
to
be
explained
to
her
nuns
wished
that
the
piety
of
her
daughters
should
be
based
on
science
that
this
faith
should
be
sustained
by
liturgical
food
if
i
may
say
so
i
know
nothing
of
her
but
her
observed
durtal
and
they
have
left
with
me
the
memory
of
echoed
words
of
things
said
again
from
the
sacred
books
so
far
as
one
may
judge
from
simple
extracts
she
does
not
appear
to
have
original
expression
and
to
be
far
below
saint
teresa
or
saint
angela
no
doubt
answered
the
monk
but
she
comes
near
saint
angela
by
the
gift
of
familiarity
when
she
converses
with
christ
and
also
by
the
loving
vehemence
of
what
she
says
only
all
this
is
transformed
on
leaving
its
proper
source
she
thinks
liturgically
and
this
is
so
true
that
the
least
of
her
reflections
at
once
presents
itself
to
her
clothed
in
the
language
of
the
gospels
and
the
psalms
her
her
her
of
divine
love
are
marvellous
from
this
point
of
view
and
then
her
prayer
to
the
blessed
virgin
is
exquisite
which
opens
with
this
phrase
o
white
lily
of
the
trinity
resplendent
and
always
at
rest
as
a
continuation
of
her
works
the
benedictine
fathers
of
solesmes
have
edited
also
the
of
saint
mechtilde
her
book
on
grace
and
her
of
the
divinity
they
are
there
on
that
shelf
let
me
show
you
said
in
his
turn
bruno
guides
wisely
marked
out
for
the
soul
which
escapes
from
itself
and
will
attempt
to
climb
the
eternal
mountains
and
he
handed
to
durtal
the
lucerna
mystica
of
lopez
ezquerra
the
quartos
of
scaramelli
the
volumes
of
schram
the
christian
asceticism
of
ribet
the
principles
of
mystic
theology
of
father
seraphin
and
do
you
know
this
continued
the
oblate
the
volume
he
offered
was
called
on
prayer
was
anonymous
and
bore
at
the
bottom
of
its
first
page
solesmes
printed
at
the
abbey
of
saint
cecilia
and
above
the
printed
date
durtal
made
out
the
word
written
in
ink
confidential
i
have
never
seen
this
little
book
which
seems
moreover
to
have
never
been
brought
into
the
market
who
is
the
author
the
most
extraordinary
nun
of
our
time
the
abbess
of
the
benedictine
nuns
at
solesmes
i
regret
only
that
you
are
going
so
soon
for
i
should
have
been
happy
to
let
you
read
it
as
far
as
the
document
is
concerned
it
is
of
a
most
extraordinary
science
and
it
contains
admirable
quotations
from
saint
hildegarde
and
cassien
as
far
as
mysticism
is
concerned
mother
saint
cecilia
evidently
only
reproduces
the
works
of
her
predecessors
and
she
tells
us
nothing
very
new
nevertheless
i
remember
a
passage
which
seems
to
me
more
special
more
personal
wait
and
the
oblate
turned
over
a
few
pages
here
it
is
spiritualized
soul
does
not
appear
exposed
to
temptation
properly
but
by
a
divine
permission
it
is
called
upon
to
conflict
with
the
demon
spirit
against
spirit
the
contact
with
the
demon
is
then
perceived
on
the
surface
of
the
soul
under
the
form
of
a
burn
at
once
spiritual
and
sensible
if
the
soul
hold
good
in
its
union
with
god
if
it
be
strong
the
pain
however
sharp
is
bearable
but
if
the
soul
commit
any
slight
imperfection
even
inwardly
the
demon
makes
just
so
much
way
and
carries
his
horrible
burning
more
forward
until
by
generous
acts
the
soul
can
repulse
him
further
this
touch
of
satan
which
produces
an
almost
material
effect
on
the
most
intangible
parts
of
our
being
is
you
will
admit
at
least
curious
concluded
the
oblate
as
he
closed
the
volume
mother
saint
cecilia
is
a
remarkable
strategist
of
the
soul
said
the
prior
but
but
this
work
which
she
edited
for
the
daughters
of
her
abbey
contains
i
think
some
rash
propositions
which
have
not
been
read
without
displeasure
at
rome
to
have
done
with
our
poor
treasures
he
continued
we
have
only
on
this
side
and
he
pointed
out
a
portion
of
the
which
covered
the
room
works
the
menology
patrology
dictionaries
of
the
lives
of
the
saints
manuals
of
sacred
interpretation
canon
law
christian
apology
biblical
exegesis
the
complete
works
of
saint
thomas
tools
of
work
which
we
rarely
employ
for
as
you
know
we
are
a
branch
of
the
benedictine
trunk
vowed
to
a
life
of
bodily
labour
and
penance
we
are
men
of
sorrow
for
god
above
all
things
here
is
bruno
who
uses
these
books
so
do
i
at
times
for
i
have
special
charge
of
spiritual
matters
in
this
monastery
added
the
monk
with
a
smile
durtal
looked
at
him
he
handled
the
volumes
with
caressing
hands
brooded
over
them
with
the
blue
lustre
of
his
eye
laughed
with
the
joy
of
a
child
as
he
turned
their
pages
what
a
difference
between
this
monk
who
evidently
adores
his
books
and
the
prior
with
his
imperious
profile
and
silent
lips
who
heard
his
confession
the
second
day
then
thinking
of
all
these
trappists
the
severity
of
their
countenances
the
joy
of
their
eyes
durtal
said
to
himself
that
these
cistercians
were
not
at
all
as
the
world
believed
solemn
and
funereal
people
but
that
quite
the
contrary
they
were
the
gayest
of
men
now
said
father
maximin
the
reverend
father
abbot
has
charged
me
with
a
commission
knowing
that
you
will
leave
us
he
is
anxious
now
that
he
is
better
to
pass
at
least
some
minutes
with
you
he
will
be
free
this
evening
will
it
trouble
you
to
join
him
after
compline
not
at
all
i
shall
be
glad
to
talk
with
dom
anselm
that
is
understood
then
they
went
downstairs
durtal
thanked
the
prior
who
the
enclosure
of
the
corridors
and
the
oblate
who
went
up
to
his
cell
he
trifled
about
and
in
spite
of
the
torment
of
his
departure
which
haunted
him
reached
the
evening
without
too
much
trouble
the
salve
regina
which
he
heard
perhaps
for
the
last
time
thus
sung
by
male
voices
that
airy
chapel
built
of
sound
and
evaporating
with
the
close
of
the
antiphon
in
the
smoke
of
the
tapers
stirred
him
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
the
trappist
monastery
showed
itself
truly
charming
this
evening
after
the
office
they
said
the
rosary
not
as
at
paris
where
they
recite
a
pater
ten
aves
and
a
gloria
and
so
over
again
here
they
said
in
latin
a
pater
an
ave
a
gloria
and
began
again
till
in
that
manner
they
had
finished
several
decades
this
rosary
was
said
on
their
knees
half
by
the
prior
half
by
all
the
monks
it
went
at
so
rapid
a
pace
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
distinguish
the
words
but
as
soon
as
it
was
ended
at
a
signal
there
was
a
great
silence
and
each
one
prayed
with
his
head
in
his
hands
and
durtal
took
notice
of
the
ingenious
system
of
conventual
prayers
after
the
prayers
purely
vocal
like
these
came
mental
prayer
personal
petitions
stimulated
and
set
by
the
very
machine
of
paternosters
nothing
is
left
to
chance
in
religion
every
exercise
which
seems
at
first
useless
has
a
reason
for
its
being
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
out
into
the
court
and
the
fact
is
that
the
rosary
which
seems
to
be
only
a
of
sounds
fulfils
an
end
it
reposes
the
soul
wearied
with
the
supplications
which
it
has
recited
applying
itself
to
them
thinking
of
them
it
hinders
it
from
babbling
and
reciting
to
god
always
the
same
petitions
the
same
complaints
it
allows
it
to
take
breath
to
take
rest
in
prayers
in
which
it
can
dispense
with
reflection
and
in
fact
the
rosary
occupies
in
prayer
those
hours
of
fatigue
in
which
one
would
not
pray
ah
here
is
the
father
abbot
the
trappist
expressed
to
him
his
regret
at
visiting
him
only
thus
for
a
few
moments
then
after
he
had
answered
durtal
who
inquired
after
the
state
of
his
health
which
he
hoped
was
at
last
he
proposed
to
him
to
walk
in
the
garden
and
begged
him
not
to
inconvenience
himself
by
not
smoking
cigarettes
if
he
had
a
mind
to
do
so
and
the
conversation
turned
on
paris
dom
anselm
asked
for
some
information
and
ended
by
saying
with
a
smile
i
see
by
scraps
of
newspapers
which
come
to
me
that
society
just
now
is
infected
with
socialism
everyone
wishes
to
solve
the
famous
social
question
how
does
that
get
on
how
does
that
get
on
why
not
at
all
unless
you
can
change
the
souls
of
workmen
and
masters
and
make
them
disinterested
and
charitable
between
and
in
what
can
you
expect
these
systems
to
end
well
said
the
monk
enwrapping
the
monastery
with
a
gesture
the
question
is
solved
here
as
wages
do
not
exist
all
sources
of
conflicts
are
suppressed
as
every
task
is
according
to
aptitudes
and
powers
the
fathers
who
are
not
and
fold
the
packages
of
chocolate
or
make
out
the
bills
and
those
who
are
robust
dig
the
ground
i
add
that
the
equality
in
our
cloisters
is
such
that
the
prior
and
the
abbot
have
no
advantage
over
the
other
monks
at
table
the
portions
and
in
the
dormitory
the
paillasses
are
identical
the
sole
profits
of
the
abbot
consist
on
the
whole
in
the
inevitable
cares
arising
from
the
moral
conduct
and
the
temporal
administration
of
an
abbey
there
is
therefore
no
reason
why
the
workmen
of
a
convent
should
go
on
strike
concluded
the
abbot
with
a
smile
yes
but
you
are
minimists
you
suppress
the
family
and
woman
you
live
on
nothing
and
expect
the
only
real
recompense
for
your
labours
after
death
how
can
you
make
the
people
in
the
towns
understand
that
the
social
system
may
thus
be
summed
up
as
i
think
the
masters
wish
to
profit
by
the
workmen
who
in
their
turn
desire
to
be
paid
as
much
as
possible
for
as
little
work
as
possible
well
then
there
is
no
way
out
of
that
exactly
and
there
is
the
sad
part
of
it
for
socialism
in
fact
arises
from
kindly
ideas
just
ideas
and
will
always
run
up
against
egotism
and
gain
against
the
inevitable
breakers
of
the
sins
of
man
and
your
little
chocolate
factory
gives
you
at
least
some
income
yes
that
saves
us
the
abbot
was
silent
for
a
second
then
he
went
on
you
know
sir
how
a
convent
is
founded
i
take
for
example
our
order
a
domain
and
the
lands
about
it
are
offered
the
order
on
condition
that
it
peoples
them
the
order
takes
a
handful
of
its
monks
and
settles
them
as
a
swarm
on
the
soil
given
to
it
there
its
task
stops
the
grain
must
spring
up
of
itself
or
to
put
it
differently
the
trappists
severed
from
their
must
gain
their
livelihood
and
suffice
for
themselves
so
when
we
took
possession
of
these
buildings
we
were
so
poor
that
from
bread
to
shoes
everything
was
lacking
but
we
had
no
anxiety
for
the
future
for
there
is
no
example
in
monastic
history
that
providence
has
not
succoured
abbeys
who
trusted
in
it
little
by
little
we
drew
our
food
from
the
estate
and
we
learnt
useful
trades
now
we
make
our
habits
and
our
shoes
we
reap
our
wheat
and
make
our
bread
our
material
existence
is
therefore
assured
but
the
taxes
crush
us
therefore
we
have
founded
this
factory
of
which
the
report
becomes
better
from
year
to
year
in
a
year
or
two
the
building
which
shelters
us
and
for
want
of
money
we
have
been
unable
to
repair
will
tumble
down
but
if
god
then
allows
generous
souls
to
come
to
our
aid
perhaps
we
shall
be
in
a
condition
to
build
a
monastery
which
is
the
wish
of
all
of
us
for
indeed
this
hovel
with
its
rooms
in
confusion
and
its
is
painful
to
us
the
abbot
was
silent
again
then
after
a
pause
he
said
in
a
low
voice
speaking
to
himself
it
can
not
be
denied
a
convent
which
has
not
the
look
of
a
cloister
is
an
obstacle
to
vocations
the
postulant
has
need
and
this
is
quite
natural
to
mould
himself
in
surroundings
which
please
him
to
encourage
himself
in
a
church
which
wraps
him
round
in
a
somewhat
sombre
chapel
and
to
obtain
that
result
you
want
the
romanesque
or
gothic
style
ah
yes
indeed
and
have
you
many
novices
we
have
especially
many
subjects
who
desire
to
feel
the
life
of
trappists
but
the
greater
part
do
not
succeed
in
supporting
our
way
of
life
beside
even
the
question
of
knowing
whether
the
vocation
of
the
beginners
is
imaginary
or
real
we
are
from
the
physical
point
of
view
clearly
fixed
after
a
fortnight
trial
eating
vegetables
only
must
crush
the
most
robust
constitutions
i
do
not
even
understand
how
leading
an
active
life
you
can
bear
it
the
truth
is
that
bodies
obey
where
souls
are
resolute
our
ancestors
endured
the
life
of
the
trappists
very
well
we
want
souls
at
the
present
day
i
remember
that
when
i
made
my
probation
in
a
cistercian
cloister
i
had
no
health
and
yet
had
it
been
necessary
i
would
have
eaten
stones
moreover
the
rule
will
soon
be
softened
pursued
the
abbot
but
in
any
case
there
is
a
country
which
if
there
should
be
scarcity
assures
us
a
good
number
of
recruits
holland
and
seeing
durtal
look
of
astonishment
the
father
said
yes
in
that
protestant
country
mystic
vegetation
is
flourishing
catholicism
is
all
the
more
fervent
that
it
is
if
not
persecuted
at
least
despised
drowned
in
the
mass
of
calvinists
perhaps
this
belongs
also
to
the
nature
of
the
soil
to
its
solitary
plains
its
silent
canals
to
the
very
taste
of
the
dutch
for
a
regular
and
peaceable
life
but
in
that
little
knot
of
catholics
the
cistercian
vocation
is
always
very
common
durtal
looked
at
the
trappist
as
he
walked
majestic
and
quiet
his
head
buried
in
his
hood
his
hands
passed
under
his
cincture
from
time
to
time
his
eyes
grew
bright
inside
his
hood
and
the
amethyst
which
he
wore
on
his
finger
sparkled
in
brief
flames
no
sound
was
heard
at
this
hour
the
monastery
was
asleep
durtal
and
the
abbot
were
walking
on
the
banks
of
the
great
pond
where
the
water
was
alive
it
alone
wakeful
in
the
slumber
of
the
woods
for
the
moon
which
shone
in
a
cloudless
sky
sowed
a
myriad
of
goldfish
and
this
luminous
spawn
fallen
from
the
planet
mounted
descended
sparkled
in
a
thousand
little
points
of
fire
of
which
the
wind
as
it
blew
increased
the
brightness
the
abbot
spoke
no
longer
and
durtal
who
was
thinking
intoxicated
by
the
sweetness
of
the
night
groaned
suddenly
he
had
just
considered
that
at
this
same
hour
the
next
day
he
would
be
at
paris
and
seeing
the
monastery
whose
pale
front
appeared
at
the
end
of
a
walk
as
at
the
end
of
a
dark
tunnel
he
cried
thinking
of
all
the
monks
who
inhabited
it
ah
they
are
happy
and
the
abbot
answered
too
happy
then
gently
in
a
low
voice
yes
it
is
true
we
enter
here
to
do
penance
to
mortify
ourselves
and
we
have
hardly
begun
to
suffer
when
god
consoles
us
he
is
so
good
that
he
himself
wishes
to
deceive
himself
about
our
merits
if
at
certain
moments
he
allows
the
demon
to
persecute
us
he
gives
us
in
exchange
so
much
happiness
that
there
is
no
proportion
preserved
between
the
recompense
and
the
sorrow
sometimes
when
i
think
of
it
i
ask
myself
how
there
still
subsists
that
equilibrium
that
nuns
and
monks
are
charged
to
maintain
since
neither
of
us
suffer
enough
to
neutralize
the
repeated
sins
of
towns
the
abbot
stopped
and
then
went
on
pensively
the
world
does
not
even
conceive
that
the
austerity
of
the
abbeys
can
profit
it
the
doctrine
of
mystical
compensation
escapes
it
entirely
it
can
not
represent
to
itself
that
the
substitution
of
the
innocent
for
the
guilty
is
necessary
when
to
suffer
merited
punishment
is
concerned
nor
does
it
explain
to
itself
any
more
that
in
wishing
to
suffer
for
others
monks
turn
aside
the
wrath
of
heaven
and
establish
a
solidarity
in
the
good
which
is
a
against
the
federation
of
evil
god
knows
moreover
with
what
cataclysms
the
unconscious
world
would
be
menaced
if
in
consequence
of
a
sudden
disappearance
of
all
the
cloisters
the
equilibrium
which
saves
it
were
broken
the
case
has
already
presented
itself
said
durtal
who
while
listening
to
the
trappist
thought
of
the
abbé
gévresin
and
remembered
how
that
priest
had
expressed
himself
on
the
same
subject
in
nearly
similar
terms
the
revolution
in
fact
suppressed
all
convents
with
one
stroke
of
a
pen
but
i
think
that
the
history
of
that
time
when
so
many
hucksters
were
busy
is
still
to
be
written
instead
of
searching
for
documents
on
the
acts
and
even
on
the
persons
of
the
jacobins
the
archives
of
the
religious
orders
which
existed
at
that
time
should
be
ransacked
in
working
thus
at
the
side
of
the
revolution
in
sounding
its
neighbourhood
its
foundations
will
be
exhumed
its
causes
will
be
brought
to
the
surface
and
it
will
certainly
be
discovered
that
in
proportion
to
the
suppression
of
convents
monstrous
excesses
had
birth
who
knows
if
the
demoniacal
madness
of
carrier
or
marat
do
not
accord
with
the
death
of
an
abbey
whose
sanctity
preserved
france
for
years
to
be
just
answered
the
abbot
it
is
right
to
say
that
the
revolution
destroyed
ruins
only
the
rule
of
ended
by
giving
the
monasteries
over
to
satan
it
was
they
alas
that
by
the
relaxation
of
their
morals
inclined
the
balance
and
drew
down
the
lightning
on
the
land
the
terror
was
only
a
consequence
of
their
impiety
god
whom
nothing
longer
withheld
let
things
take
their
course
yes
but
how
can
you
now
prove
the
necessity
of
compensations
to
a
world
which
wanders
out
of
the
way
in
continued
accesses
of
gain
how
persuade
it
that
it
is
an
urgent
need
as
a
preventive
against
new
crises
to
shelter
towns
behind
the
sacred
bulwarks
of
cloisters
after
the
siege
of
paris
was
wisely
sheltered
behind
an
immense
net
of
impregnable
forts
but
is
it
not
also
indispensable
to
surround
it
with
a
cincture
of
prayers
to
buttress
its
neighbourhood
with
conventual
houses
to
build
everywhere
in
its
suburbs
convents
of
poor
clares
carmelites
benedictine
nuns
of
the
blessed
sacrament
monasteries
which
will
be
in
some
degree
powerful
citadels
destined
to
arrest
the
forward
march
of
the
armies
of
evil
certainly
the
towns
have
great
need
of
being
guaranteed
against
infernal
invasions
by
a
sanitary
defence
of
orders
but
come
sir
i
must
not
deprive
you
of
necessary
rest
i
will
join
you
before
you
quit
our
solitude
i
have
now
but
to
say
that
you
have
only
friends
here
and
that
you
will
be
always
welcome
i
hope
that
on
your
side
you
will
keep
no
unfavourable
memory
of
our
poor
hospitality
and
that
you
will
prove
it
in
coming
to
see
us
again
as
they
talked
they
had
come
in
front
of
the
the
father
pressed
durtal
hands
and
slowly
ascended
the
stairs
sweeping
with
his
robe
the
silver
dust
of
the
steps
as
he
mounted
all
white
in
a
ray
of
the
moon
chapter
ix
durtal
wished
immediately
after
mass
to
visit
for
the
last
time
that
wood
through
which
he
had
walked
in
turn
so
languidly
and
so
rapidly
he
went
at
first
to
the
old
lime
alley
whose
pale
emanations
were
verily
for
his
spirit
what
an
infusion
of
their
leaves
is
for
the
body
a
sort
of
very
weak
panacea
a
kindly
and
soothing
sedative
then
he
sat
down
in
their
shade
on
a
stone
bench
as
he
leant
forward
a
little
he
could
see
through
the
moving
spaces
in
the
branches
the
solemn
front
of
the
abbey
and
opposite
it
separated
by
the
kitchen
garden
the
gigantic
cross
standing
before
that
liquid
plan
of
a
church
which
the
pond
simulated
he
rose
and
approached
the
watery
cross
of
which
the
sky
turned
the
marble
water
blue
and
he
contemplated
the
great
crucifix
in
white
marble
which
towered
above
the
whole
monastery
and
seemed
to
rise
opposite
to
it
as
a
permanent
reminder
of
the
vows
of
suffering
which
he
had
accepted
and
reserved
to
himself
to
change
at
length
into
joys
the
fact
is
said
durtal
who
thought
over
again
the
contradictory
declarations
of
the
monks
confessing
that
they
led
at
once
the
most
attractive
and
the
most
atrocious
life
the
fact
is
that
the
good
god
deceives
them
they
attain
here
below
paradise
while
they
seek
hell
there
i
have
myself
tasted
how
strange
is
existence
in
this
cloister
for
i
have
been
here
almost
at
the
same
time
very
unhappy
and
very
happy
and
now
i
feel
well
the
mirage
which
is
already
beginning
before
two
days
are
over
the
remembrance
of
the
sorrows
which
then
were
if
i
recall
them
with
care
greatly
above
the
joys
will
have
disappeared
and
i
shall
only
recall
those
interior
emotions
in
the
chapel
those
delicious
stolen
moments
in
the
morning
in
the
pathways
of
the
park
i
shall
regret
the
prison
of
this
convent
it
is
curious
i
find
myself
attached
to
it
by
obscure
bonds
when
i
am
in
my
cell
there
return
to
me
all
kinds
of
memories
like
those
of
an
ancient
race
i
find
myself
at
once
at
home
again
in
a
place
i
had
never
seen
i
recognize
from
the
first
moment
a
very
special
life
of
which
nevertheless
i
know
nothing
it
seems
to
me
that
something
which
interests
me
which
is
indeed
personal
to
me
passed
here
before
i
was
born
truly
if
i
believed
in
metempsychosis
i
might
imagine
i
had
been
a
monk
in
anterior
existences
a
bad
monk
then
he
said
smiling
at
his
reflections
since
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
be
reincarnate
and
to
return
to
a
cloister
to
expiate
my
sins
while
thus
talking
with
himself
he
had
passed
across
a
long
alley
which
led
to
the
end
of
the
enclosure
and
cutting
across
the
road
and
through
the
thickets
he
strayed
into
the
wood
of
the
great
pond
it
was
not
in
motion
as
on
certain
days
when
the
wind
made
hollows
in
it
and
swelled
it
made
it
flow
and
return
on
itself
as
soon
as
it
touched
its
banks
it
remained
immovable
and
was
only
stirred
by
the
reflections
of
the
moving
clouds
and
of
the
trees
at
moments
a
leaf
fallen
from
the
neighbouring
poplars
swam
on
the
image
of
a
cloud
at
others
bubbles
of
air
came
from
the
bottom
and
burst
on
the
surface
in
the
reflected
blue
of
heaven
durtal
looked
for
the
otter
but
it
did
not
show
itself
he
saw
only
the
swallows
which
skimmed
the
water
with
their
wing
the
which
sparkled
like
jewels
flashing
like
the
blue
flames
of
sulphur
if
he
had
suffered
near
the
before
the
sheet
of
water
of
the
other
pond
he
could
only
call
up
the
memory
of
healing
hours
which
he
had
passed
lying
on
a
bed
of
moss
or
a
couch
of
dry
reeds
and
he
looked
at
it
tenderly
trying
to
fix
and
carry
it
away
in
his
memory
to
again
in
paris
shutting
his
eyes
on
the
bank
he
pursued
his
walk
and
stopped
in
an
alley
of
chestnuts
along
the
walls
above
the
monastery
thence
he
went
into
the
court
in
front
of
the
cloister
the
outbuildings
the
stables
the
woodsheds
even
the
he
tried
to
see
brother
simeon
but
he
was
probably
engaged
in
the
stables
for
he
did
not
appear
the
buildings
were
silent
the
pigs
were
shut
up
only
some
lean
cats
prowled
about
in
silence
scarcely
looking
when
they
met
each
other
going
each
on
its
own
side
no
doubt
seeking
some
nourishing
game
which
would
console
them
for
the
eternal
meals
of
vegetable
soup
served
them
at
the
monastery
time
was
getting
on
he
prayed
for
the
last
time
in
the
chapel
and
went
to
his
cell
to
get
his
portmanteau
ready
while
putting
his
things
in
order
he
thought
of
the
inutility
of
decorated
rooms
he
had
spent
all
his
money
at
paris
in
buying
ornaments
and
books
for
till
now
he
had
detested
bare
walls
but
now
considering
the
blank
walls
of
this
room
he
admitted
to
himself
that
he
had
done
better
between
these
four
walls
than
in
his
room
at
paris
hung
with
stuffs
suddenly
he
recognized
that
la
trappe
had
weaned
him
from
his
preferences
had
in
a
few
days
completely
upset
him
the
power
of
such
an
environment
he
said
to
himself
a
little
alarmed
at
feeling
how
he
was
transformed
and
he
thought
in
buckling
his
portmanteau
i
must
however
go
and
find
father
etienne
for
i
must
settle
my
account
i
can
not
be
altogether
a
debtor
to
these
good
people
he
went
along
the
corridors
and
ended
by
meeting
the
father
in
the
court
he
was
a
little
confused
how
to
open
the
question
at
the
first
words
the
smiled
the
rule
of
saint
benedict
is
formal
he
said
we
must
receive
our
guests
as
we
receive
our
lord
jesus
himself
that
is
to
tell
you
that
we
can
not
exchange
our
poor
care
for
money
and
when
durtal
insisted
embarrassed
if
it
does
not
suit
you
to
have
partaken
of
our
meagre
pittance
without
paying
do
as
you
please
only
the
sum
which
you
may
give
will
be
distributed
in
coins
of
ten
or
twenty
sous
to
the
poor
who
come
each
morning
often
from
a
great
distance
to
knock
at
our
monastery
gate
durtal
bowed
and
handed
the
money
which
he
had
ready
in
his
pocket
to
the
father
but
he
inquired
if
he
might
not
have
a
word
with
father
maximin
before
his
departure
certainly
moreover
father
prior
would
not
have
let
you
go
without
shaking
hands
with
you
i
will
go
and
make
certain
if
he
be
free
wait
for
me
in
the
refectory
and
the
monk
disappeared
and
came
back
a
few
minutes
afterwards
preceded
by
the
prior
ah
well
said
he
then
you
are
going
to
plunge
again
into
the
oh
without
any
pleasure
father
i
understand
that
it
is
so
good
is
it
not
no
longer
to
hear
anything
and
to
be
silent
however
take
courage
we
will
pray
for
you
and
as
durtal
thanked
both
of
them
for
their
kind
attentions
it
is
a
pleasure
to
receive
a
retreatant
such
as
you
cried
father
etienne
nothing
repulses
you
and
you
are
so
exact
that
you
are
about
before
the
hour
you
rendered
my
task
of
overseer
easy
if
all
were
as
little
exacting
and
as
pliable
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
given
lodging
to
priests
sent
by
their
bishops
as
a
penance
ecclesiastics
of
whose
complaints
about
food
lodging
the
need
of
rising
early
in
the
morning
never
ceased
if
again
said
the
prior
one
could
hope
to
recall
them
to
good
to
send
them
back
healed
to
their
parishes
but
no
they
go
away
still
more
rebellious
than
before
the
devil
does
not
let
them
alone
during
this
conversation
a
lay
brother
brought
in
some
dishes
covered
with
plates
and
placed
them
on
the
table
we
have
changed
the
hour
of
your
dinner
because
of
the
train
said
father
etienne
good
appetite
adieu
and
may
the
lord
bless
you
said
the
prior
he
raised
his
hand
and
enwrapped
durtal
with
a
great
sign
of
the
cross
who
knelt
surprised
at
the
sudden
emotion
in
the
monk
tone
but
father
maximin
recovered
himself
at
once
and
he
bowed
to
him
as
bruno
entered
the
meal
was
silent
the
oblate
was
visibly
distressed
at
the
departure
of
the
companion
whom
he
loved
and
durtal
looked
with
a
swelling
heart
at
the
old
man
who
had
so
charitably
come
out
of
his
solitude
to
give
him
aid
will
you
not
come
some
day
to
see
me
in
paris
he
said
no
i
have
quitted
life
without
any
mind
to
return
to
it
i
am
dead
to
the
world
i
do
not
wish
to
see
paris
again
i
have
no
wish
to
live
again
but
if
god
lend
me
still
a
few
years
of
existence
i
hope
to
see
you
here
again
for
it
is
not
in
vain
that
one
has
crossed
the
threshold
of
mystic
asceticism
to
verify
by
one
own
experience
the
reality
of
the
requirements
which
our
lord
brings
about
now
as
god
does
not
proceed
by
chance
he
will
certainly
finish
his
work
by
sifting
you
as
wheat
i
venture
to
recommend
you
to
try
not
to
give
way
and
attempt
to
die
in
some
measure
to
yourself
in
order
not
to
run
counter
to
his
plans
i
know
well
said
durtal
that
all
is
displaced
in
me
that
i
am
no
longer
the
same
but
what
frightens
me
is
that
i
am
now
sure
that
the
works
of
the
teresan
school
are
exact
then
then
if
one
must
the
cylinders
of
the
rolling
mill
which
saint
john
of
the
cross
describes
the
noise
of
a
carriage
in
the
court
interrupted
him
bruno
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
your
luggage
is
down
yes
they
looked
at
each
other
listen
i
would
wish
indeed
to
say
to
you
no
no
do
not
thank
me
cried
the
oblate
see
i
have
never
so
thoroughly
understood
the
misery
of
my
being
ah
if
i
had
been
another
man
i
might
by
praying
better
have
aided
you
more
the
door
opened
and
father
etienne
declared
you
have
not
a
minute
to
lose
if
you
do
not
wish
to
miss
the
train
thus
hurried
durtal
had
only
time
to
press
the
hand
of
his
friend
who
accompanied
him
to
the
court
he
found
waiting
a
sort
of
open
wagon
driven
by
a
trappist
who
below
a
bald
head
and
cheeks
streaked
with
rose
threads
had
a
great
black
beard
durtal
pressed
the
hands
of
the
and
the
oblate
for
the
last
time
when
the
father
abbot
came
in
his
turn
to
wish
him
a
safe
journey
and
at
the
end
of
the
court
durtal
perceived
two
eyes
fixed
on
him
those
of
brother
anacletus
who
at
a
distance
said
adieu
by
a
slight
bow
but
without
other
gesture
even
this
poor
man
whose
eloquent
look
told
of
a
truly
touching
affection
had
a
saint
pity
for
the
stranger
whom
he
had
seen
so
tumultuous
and
so
sad
in
the
desolate
solitude
of
the
wood
certainly
the
stiffness
of
the
rule
forbade
all
show
of
feeling
to
these
monks
but
durtal
felt
thoroughly
that
for
him
they
had
gone
to
the
limit
of
concessions
allowed
and
his
affliction
was
great
as
he
cast
them
in
parting
a
last
expression
of
thanks
and
the
door
of
the
monastery
closed
that
door
at
which
he
had
trembled
in
arriving
and
at
which
he
now
looked
with
tears
in
his
eyes
we
must
get
on
fast
said
the
procurator
for
we
are
late
and
the
horse
went
at
a
great
speed
along
the
lanes
durtal
recognized
his
companion
as
having
seen
him
in
the
chapel
singing
in
the
choir
during
the
office
he
had
an
air
at
once
and
firm
and
his
little
grey
eye
smiled
as
it
glanced
behind
his
branched
spectacles
well
said
he
how
have
you
borne
our
regimen
i
have
had
every
chance
i
came
herewith
my
stomach
out
of
order
my
body
ill
and
the
simple
trappist
meals
have
cured
me
and
when
durtal
narrated
briefly
the
stages
of
soul
he
had
undergone
the
monk
murmured
that
is
nothing
in
regard
to
demoniacal
attacks
we
have
had
here
true
cases
of
possession
and
brother
simeon
discovered
them
ah
you
know
that
and
he
replied
quite
simply
to
durtal
who
spoke
to
him
of
his
admiration
for
the
poor
lay
brothers
you
are
right
sir
if
you
could
talk
with
these
peasants
and
illiterate
men
you
would
be
surprised
at
the
often
profound
answers
which
these
people
give
you
then
they
alone
at
the
monastery
are
really
courageous
we
the
fathers
when
we
think
ourselves
too
weak
accept
willingly
the
authorized
addition
of
an
egg
they
never
they
pray
more
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
our
lord
listens
to
them
since
they
get
well
again
and
indeed
are
never
and
to
a
question
of
durtal
who
asked
him
in
what
consisted
the
functions
of
procurator
the
monk
answered
they
consist
in
keeping
the
accounts
in
being
the
commercial
agent
in
travelling
in
managing
alas
everything
which
does
not
concern
the
life
of
the
cloister
but
we
are
so
few
in
number
at
notre
dame
de
that
we
become
necessarily
for
instance
father
etienne
is
cellarer
of
the
abbey
and
he
is
also
sacristan
and
i
too
am
first
cantor
and
professor
of
plain
song
and
while
the
carriage
rolled
along
shaken
by
the
ruts
the
procurator
declared
to
durtal
who
told
him
how
much
the
offices
chanted
at
the
monastery
had
delighted
him
it
is
not
with
us
that
you
ought
to
hear
them
our
choirs
are
too
restricted
too
weak
to
be
able
to
raise
the
giant
mass
of
those
chants
you
ought
to
go
to
the
black
monks
of
solesmes
or
ligugé
if
you
wish
to
find
the
gregorian
melodies
executed
as
they
were
in
the
middle
ages
by
the
way
do
you
know
in
paris
the
benedictine
nuns
in
the
rue
monsieur
yes
but
do
you
not
think
they
coo
a
little
i
can
not
say
all
the
same
their
collection
of
tunes
is
authentic
but
at
the
little
seminary
at
versailles
you
have
better
still
since
they
chant
there
exactly
as
at
solesmes
note
this
well
moreover
at
paris
when
the
churches
decline
to
repudiate
liturgical
music
they
use
for
the
most
part
the
false
notation
printed
and
spread
in
abundance
in
all
the
dioceses
in
france
by
the
house
of
pustet
of
ratisbon
but
the
errors
and
frauds
with
which
those
editions
abound
are
well
known
the
legend
on
which
its
partisans
rely
is
incorrect
to
assert
as
they
do
that
this
version
is
no
other
than
that
of
palestrina
who
was
charged
by
pope
paul
to
revive
the
musical
liturgy
of
the
church
is
an
argument
destitute
of
truth
and
void
of
force
for
everyone
knows
that
when
palestrina
died
he
had
hardly
begun
the
correction
of
the
gradual
i
will
add
that
even
if
that
musician
had
finished
his
work
that
would
not
prove
that
his
interpretation
ought
to
be
preferred
to
that
which
has
been
recently
constituted
after
patient
researches
by
the
abbey
of
solesmes
for
the
benedictine
texts
are
based
on
the
copy
preserved
at
the
monastery
of
gall
of
the
antiphonary
of
saint
gregory
which
represents
the
most
ancient
and
the
most
certain
monument
which
the
church
preserves
of
the
true
plain
chant
this
manuscript
of
which
photographic
facsimiles
exist
is
the
code
of
gregorian
melodies
and
it
ought
to
be
if
i
may
use
the
expression
the
neumatic
bible
of
choirs
the
disciples
of
saint
benedict
are
then
absolutely
right
when
they
declare
that
their
version
alone
is
faithful
alone
correct
how
then
comes
it
that
so
many
churches
get
their
music
from
ratisbon
alas
how
comes
it
that
pustet
has
so
long
acquired
the
monopoly
of
liturgical
books
and
but
no
better
hold
one
peace
take
this
only
for
certain
that
the
german
volumes
are
the
absolute
negation
of
the
gregorian
tradition
the
most
complete
heresy
of
plain
chant
by
the
way
what
time
is
it
we
must
make
haste
said
the
procurator
looking
at
the
watch
which
durtal
held
up
to
him
come
up
my
beauty
and
he
whipped
up
the
mare
you
drive
with
spirit
cried
durtal
it
is
true
i
forgot
to
say
to
you
that
over
and
above
my
other
functions
i
also
have
if
need
be
that
of
coachman
durtal
thought
all
the
same
that
these
people
were
extraordinary
who
lived
an
interior
life
in
god
as
soon
as
they
consented
to
redescend
on
earth
they
revealed
themselves
as
the
most
sagacious
and
the
boldest
of
business
men
an
abbot
founded
a
factory
with
the
few
pence
he
succeeded
in
gathering
he
discerned
the
employment
which
suited
each
of
his
monks
and
with
them
he
improvised
artisans
writing
clerks
transformed
a
professor
of
plain
chant
into
an
agent
plunged
into
the
tumult
of
purchases
and
sales
and
little
by
little
the
house
which
scarcely
was
raised
above
the
soil
grew
put
forth
shoots
and
ended
by
nourishing
with
its
fruit
the
abbey
which
had
planted
it
transported
into
another
environment
these
people
would
have
as
easily
created
great
manufactories
and
started
banks
and
it
was
the
same
with
the
women
when
one
thinks
of
the
practical
qualities
of
a
man
of
business
and
the
coolness
of
an
old
diplomatist
which
a
mother
abbess
ought
to
possess
in
order
to
rule
her
community
one
is
obliged
to
admit
that
the
only
women
truly
intelligent
truly
remarkable
are
outside
of
outside
of
the
world
at
the
head
of
cloisters
and
as
he
expressed
his
wonder
aloud
that
monks
were
so
expert
at
setting
up
business
it
must
be
so
sighed
the
father
but
if
you
believe
that
we
do
not
regret
the
time
necessarily
spent
in
digging
the
ground
then
our
spirit
at
least
was
free
then
we
could
sanctify
ourselves
in
silence
which
to
a
monk
is
as
necessary
as
bread
for
it
is
thanks
to
it
that
he
stifles
vanity
as
it
rises
that
he
represses
disobedience
as
it
murmurs
that
he
turns
all
his
aspirations
all
his
thoughts
towards
god
and
becomes
at
last
attentive
to
his
presence
instead
of
that
but
here
we
are
at
the
station
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
your
portmanteau
but
go
and
take
your
ticket
for
i
hear
the
whistle
of
the
train
and
in
fact
durtal
had
only
time
to
shake
hands
with
the
father
who
put
his
luggage
into
the
carriage
there
when
he
was
alone
seated
looking
at
the
monk
as
he
departed
he
felt
his
heart
swell
ready
to
break
and
in
the
clatter
of
the
rails
the
train
started
sharply
clearly
in
a
minute
durtal
took
stock
of
the
frightful
disorder
into
which
he
had
thrown
the
monastery
ah
and
outside
it
all
is
the
same
to
me
and
nothing
matters
to
me
he
cried
and
he
groaned
knowing
that
he
should
never
more
succeed
in
interesting
himself
in
all
that
makes
the
joy
of
men
the
uselessness
of
caring
about
any
other
thing
than
mysticism
and
the
liturgy
of
thinking
about
aught
else
save
god
implanted
itself
in
him
so
firmly
that
he
asked
himself
what
would
become
of
him
at
paris
with
such
ideas
he
saw
himself
submitting
to
the
confusion
of
controversies
the
cowardice
of
conventionality
the
vanity
of
declarations
the
inanity
of
proofs
he
saw
himself
bruised
and
thrust
aside
by
the
reflections
of
everybody
obliged
henceforward
to
advance
or
retire
dispute
or
hold
his
tongue
in
any
case
peace
was
for
ever
lost
how
in
fact
was
he
to
rally
and
recover
when
he
was
obliged
to
dwell
in
a
place
of
passage
in
a
soul
open
to
all
winds
visited
by
a
crowd
of
public
thoughts
his
contempt
for
relations
his
disgust
for
acquaintances
grew
on
him
no
everything
rather
than
mix
myself
again
with
society
he
declared
to
himself
and
then
he
was
silent
in
despair
for
he
was
not
ignorant
that
he
could
not
apart
from
the
monastic
zone
live
in
isolation
after
a
short
time
would
come
weariness
and
a
void
therefore
why
had
he
reserved
nothing
for
himself
why
had
he
trusted
all
to
the
cloister
he
had
not
even
known
how
to
arrange
the
pleasure
of
entering
into
himself
he
had
discovered
how
to
lose
the
amusement
of
how
to
extirpate
that
last
satisfaction
in
the
white
nakedness
of
a
cell
he
no
longer
held
to
anything
but
lay
dismantled
saying
i
have
renounced
almost
all
the
happiness
which
might
fall
to
me
and
what
am
i
going
to
put
in
its
place
and
terrified
he
perceived
the
disquiet
of
a
conscience
ready
to
torment
itself
the
permanent
reproaches
of
an
acquired
lukewarmness
the
apprehensions
of
doubts
against
faith
fear
of
furious
clamours
of
the
senses
stirred
by
chance
meetings
and
he
repeated
to
himself
that
the
most
difficult
thing
would
not
be
to
master
the
emotions
of
his
flesh
but
indeed
to
live
christianly
to
confess
to
communicate
at
paris
in
a
church
he
never
could
get
so
far
as
that
and
he
imagined
discussions
with
the
abbé
gévresin
his
gaining
time
his
refusal
foreseeing
that
their
friendship
would
come
to
an
end
in
these
disputes
then
where
should
he
fly
at
the
very
recollection
of
the
trappist
monastery
the
theatrical
representations
of
sulpice
made
him
jump
severin
seemed
to
him
distracted
and
worn
how
could
he
live
among
stupid
people
like
the
devout
how
listen
without
gnashing
his
teeth
to
the
affected
chants
of
the
choirs
how
lastly
could
he
seek
again
in
the
chapel
of
the
benedictine
nuns
and
even
at
notre
dame
des
victoires
that
dull
heat
radiating
from
the
souls
of
the
monks
and
thawing
little
by
little
the
ice
of
his
poor
being
and
then
it
was
not
even
that
what
was
truly
crushing
truly
dreadful
was
to
think
that
doubtless
he
would
never
again
feel
that
admirable
joy
which
lifts
you
from
the
ground
carries
you
you
know
not
where
nor
how
above
sense
ah
those
paths
at
the
monastery
wandered
in
at
daybreak
those
paths
where
one
day
after
a
communion
god
had
dilated
his
soul
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
seemed
no
longer
his
own
so
much
had
christ
plunged
him
in
the
sea
of
his
divine
infinity
swallowed
him
in
the
heavenly
firmament
of
his
person
how
renew
that
state
of
grace
without
communion
and
outside
a
cloister
no
it
is
all
over
he
concluded
and
he
was
seized
with
such
an
access
of
sadness
such
an
outburst
of
despair
that
he
thought
of
getting
out
at
the
first
station
and
returning
to
the
monastery
and
he
had
to
shrug
his
shoulders
for
his
character
was
not
patient
enough
nor
his
will
firm
enough
nor
his
body
strong
enough
to
support
the
terrible
trials
of
a
noviciate
moreover
the
prospect
of
having
no
cell
to
himself
of
sleeping
dressed
in
a
dormitory
alarmed
him
but
what
then
and
sadly
he
took
stock
of
himself
ah
he
thought
i
have
lived
twenty
years
in
ten
days
in
that
convent
and
i
leave
it
my
brain
relaxed
my
heart
in
rags
i
am
done
for
for
ever
paris
and
notre
dame
de
have
rejected
me
each
in
their
turn
like
a
waif
and
here
i
am
condemned
to
live
apart
for
i
am
still
too
much
a
man
of
letters
to
become
a
monk
and
yet
i
am
already
too
much
a
monk
to
remain
among
men
of
letters
he
leapt
up
and
was
silent
dazzled
by
jets
of
electric
light
which
flooded
him
as
the
train
stopped
he
had
returned
to
paris
if
they
he
said
thinking
of
those
writers
whom
it
would
no
doubt
be
difficult
not
to
see
again
if
they
knew
how
inferior
they
are
to
the
lowest
of
the
lay
brothers
if
they
could
imagine
how
the
divine
intoxication
of
a
trappist
interests
me
more
than
all
their
conversations
and
all
their
books
ah
lord
that
i
might
live
live
in
the
shadow
of
the
prayers
of
humble
brother
simeon
