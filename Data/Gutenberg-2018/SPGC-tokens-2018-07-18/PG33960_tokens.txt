have
not

to
the
difficulties
which
confront
us
in
entering
upon
so
delicate
a
subject
if
we
had
thought
only
of
these
we
would
never
have
taken
up
our
pen
in
this
work
we
have
been
moved
to
it
by
the
cries
of
disappointment
and
anguish
which
may
be
heard
everywhere
throughout
our
land
and
by
the
pleadings
that
come
up
out
of
the
dense
ignorance
which
envelops
palace
and
hovel
alike
knowing
the
importance
of
these
matters
which
are
so
central
in
our
physical
life
so
essential
in
their
relation
to
the
condition
character
career
and
destiny
of
every
individual
and
so
fundamental
and
vital
to
every
institution
and
interest
of
society
knowing
also
the
importance
of
proper
intelligence
concerning
the
laws
which
govern
our
bodies
and
knowing
how
the
honest
and
the
pure
who
seek
information
concerning
these
most
sacred
relations
of
human
life
are
exposed
amid
the
dearth
of
pure
and
reliable
books
to
contamination
by
books
whose
secret
character
designedly
fosters
the
very
lusts
and
evils
which
they
are
professedly
written
to
denounce
we
have
felt
that
we
would
be
recreant
to
duty
to
humanity
and
to
god
if
we
allowed
difficulties
to
bar
us
from
this
important
work
turn
where
you
will
the
manifest
consequences
of
the
prevalent
ignorance
upon
these
vital
and
important
subjects
stare
one
in
the
face
and
the
appealing
need
of
the
hosts
of
honest
men
and
women
who
desire
such
information
as
will
enable
them
to
attain
the
noblest
and
the
best
which
god
has
placed
within
their
reach
is
a
sufficient
condemnation
of
that
spurious
modesty
which
desires
that
a
ban
shall
continue
upon
intelligence
so
that
men
and
women
may
remain
in
a
hopeless
bondage
to
vice
and
its
awful
consequences
knowing
the
universal
need
for
the
information
which
we
have
sought
to
communicate
in
a
plain
and
pure
way
in
these
pages
and
while
laboring
with
an
sense
of
the
difficulties
and
delicacies
of
the
undertaking
we
have
turned
to
our
task
with
greater
assurance
when
we
have
remembered
the
appreciative
messages
of
eminent
men
and
women
which
have
come
from
all
quarters
of
the
globe
the
unreserved
and
hearty
commendations
which
the
earlier
books
of
the
series
have
received
from
the
entire
religious
secular
educational
and
medical
press
of
the
united
states
england
and
canada
we
have
been
inspired
by
the
fact
that
these
books
are
already
being
translated
into
other
languages
that
without
suggestion
they
have

marriage
is
not
that
source
of
blessing
and
happiness
which
god
intended
its
purposes
and
possibilities
are
never
realized
thousands
are
constantly
entering
upon
marriage
only
to
be
miserable
and
wretched
because
they
do
not
understand
the
nature
and
intent
of
their
own
endowments
or
the
purpose
of
god
in
ordaining
the
institution
whatever
information
they
ever
obtain
is
secured
by
blind
blunderings
and
at
the
most
ruinous
cost
even
where
no
permanent
physical
consequences
are
entailed
mental
and
moral
effects
which
are
even
more
ruinous
in
their
results
remain
to
mar
the
blessings
of
later
years
had
they
been
intelligent
they
might
have
possessed
from
the
very
first
the
benefits
and
blessings
which
ignorance
has
placed
and
kept
beyond
their
reach
sad
as
such
results
are
they
are
still
more
grievous
because
of
the
consequences
which
must
be
suffered
by
their
families
and
which
are
handed
down
to
innocent
children
who
are
to
reap
the
results
of
parental
ignorance
long
years
after
the
parents
themselves
may
have
passed
away
it
is
to
save
young
men
and
young
women
from
such
disastrous
and
results
and
to
afford
them
the
blessing
and
happiness
which
god
intended
that
we
have
set
ourselves
to
the
task
undertaken
in
these

from
these

i
the
relation
of
marriage
the
young
man
who
marries
finds
himself
in
an
entirely
new
relation
in
life
grand
as
life
may
have
been
in
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
are
full
of
new
meaning
of
grander
possibilities
and
of
larger
blessing
god
has
meant
that
love
should
come
to
man
to
glorify
life
and
to
lift
the
lower
nature
of
husband
and
wife
into
higher
realms
of
thought
and
being
to
transform
deepen
broaden
and
soften
in
them
love
becomes
the
potent
source
of
mightiest
inspirations
the
duty
seemed
formerly
to
be
to
care
to
arrange
and
to
provide
only
for
himself
now
he
has
assumed
additional
responsibilities
he
is
no
longer
to
live
for
himself
but
for
his
wife
his
children
and
in
a
larger
sense
for
his
descendants
for
the
good
of
the
race
he
is
to
continue
by
transmitting
himself
that
life
may
remain
when
he
is
gone
what
he
does
involves
the
interests
of
his
wife
and
of
those
who
are
to
come
after
him
love
is
to
conquer
selfishness
he
is
to
rise
above
himself
and
the
present
good
and
future
happiness
of
others
are
to
constitute
his
his
present
and
future
happiness
will
be
dependent
upon
a
clear
apprehension
of
the
fact
that
what
he
is
will
determine
what
his
descendants
are
to
be
after
him
he
should
comprehend
the
fullest
meaning
of
what
is
taught
in
the
statement
that
we
are
part
of
all
the
people
whom
we
have
met
the
result
of
past
influences
and
previous
life
what
we
have
been
and
are
that
we
transmit
the
responsibilities
are
grave
but
the
state
of
two
congenial
souls
made
one
in
happy
marriage
is
the
grandest
and
most
blessed
earthly
condition
conferred
upon
man
by
god
himself
it
meets
the
requirements
of
our
being
and
when
properly
understood
and
faithfully
conformed
to
brings
the
largest
happiness
that
mortals
are
capable
of
upon
earth
husband
and
wife
parents
and
child
home
and
country
form
the
centre
of
all
that
makes
life
dear
the
purest
noblest
and
most
unselfish
aspirations
and
purposes
derive
their
strength
and
being
from
the
sweet
influences
which
have
their
beginning
and
their
continuance
in
this
power
which
draws
men
and
women
together
in
happy
and
holy
wedlock
by
these
sweet
influences
the
most
perfect
natures
are
moulded
and
ennobled
by
them
are
formed
the
strongest
ties
that
hold
humanity
to
the
accomplishment
of
every
high
and
holy
endeavor
where
the
mind
has
continued
pure
and
the
character
untarnished
and
the
life
unsullied
by
the
touch
of
social
evil
the
sexual
impulse
does
not
die
in
that
cradle
of
our
being
where
god
has
given
it
birth
but
marches
like
a
mighty
conqueror
arousing
and
marshalling
the
mightiest
human
forces
in
every
department
of
nature
it
formulates
his
purpose
quickens
his
imagination
and
calls
into
exercise
his
united
powers
in
the
attainment
of
the
greatest
and
grandest
achievements
in
art
in
letters
in
inventions
in
philosophy
in
philanthropy
and
in
every
effort
that
is
to
secure
the
universal
blessing
of
mankind
it
is
under
the
awakening
of
the
reproductive
life
that
the
fields
put
on
their
verdure
the
flowers
unfold
their
beauty
and
fragrance
the
birds
put
on
their
brightest
plumage
and
sing
their
sweetest
song
while
the
chirp
of
the
cricket
the
note
of
the
katydid
is
but
the
call
to
its
mate
for
the
voices
which
break
the
stillness
of
field
and
forest
are
but
the
myriad
notes
of
love
to
this
universal
passion
man
owes
his
love
of
color
his
love
of
beauty
and
sweetness
in
art
and
music
his
love
of
rhythm
in
poetry
of
grace
in
form
in
painting
in
sculpture
and
from
it
not
only
springs
the
love
of
the
beautiful
but
even
the
perception
and
recognition
of
all
that
which
is
pleasing
and
lovely
this
is
the
emotion
that
strengthens
every
faculty
quickens
every
power
animates
modifies
ennobles
purifies
and
sweetens
the
entire
being
and
makes
our
life
upon
earth
when
directed
by
godly
purposes
the
unfolding
and
enriching
of
those
nobler
powers
of
the
soul
which
are
to
find
their
fullest
fruition
and
perfection
in
heaven
itself
while
these
powers
may
all
be
kept
in
abeyance
until
financial
social
religious
and
other
requirements
can
be
adequately
met
yet
there
is
a
proper
time
for
their
full
expression
and
purposed
exercise
while
god
has
meant
that
reason
should
rule
over
passion
and
that
every
sexual
impulse
should
yield
to
other
requirements
and
activities
yet
he
has
wisely
purposed
that
these
leadings
of
our
nature
should
be
pronounced
and
strong
if
these
sentiments
and
emotions
were
not
strong
very
strong
indeed
no
man
knowing
the
risks
and
dangers
which
are
liable
to
arise
because
of
incompatibility
of
temper
mistaken
estimates
of
physical
intellectual
and
moral
qualifications
would
take
upon
himself
the
responsibilities
incur
the
risks
augment
his
expenses
and
assume
the
obligations
which
are
involved
when
two
are
united
for
better
or
for
worse
in
indissoluble
bonds
for
life
were
not
the
sentiment
and
emotions
strong
in
woman
as
well
as
in
man
what
woman
would
assume
the
responsibilities
of
wife
and
mother
whatever
man
is
required
to
give
up
to
endure
to
suffer
to
risk
even
more
seems
to
fall
to
the
lot
of
woman
were
it
not
for
strong
sentiment
and
moving
emotion
what
woman
would
commit
her
entire
future
to
the
keeping
of
any
man
where
is
one
who
would
assume
the
pains
and
perils
of
maternity
with
the
subsequent
possibility
of
being
left
by
the
death
of
her
husband
with
a
family
of
dependent
children
if
the
young
husband
desires
in
marriage
the
joys
and
blessings
with
which
god
has
crowned
this
relation
he
need
not
seek
the
immolation
of
his
sexual
nature
but
he
does
need
to
subordinate
his
sexual
passion
to
the
reign
of
reason
and
the
government
of
the
moral
sense
he
can
not
afford
to
ignore
the
rights
the
comfort
and
the
wishes
of
his
wife
if
he
looks
upon
marriage
as
an
easy
means
of
securing
as
affording
a
safe
and
lawful
means
for
unbridled
gratification
he
is
doomed
to
disappointment
and
to
misery
if
passion
is
to
be
enthroned
where
god
ordained
that
none
but
love
should
reign
then
anarchy
with
all
its
attendant
horrors
must
and
surely
will
desolate
the
heart
the
home
and
the
life
for
lust
can
filch
but
can
not
enjoy
the
pleasures
and
blessings
of
this
relation
which
are
reserved
only
for
the
pure
who
live
under
the
domain
and
rule
of
love
and
reason
to
comprehend
love
in
its
intended
relation
to
sexual
impulse
and
at
the
same
time
to
understand
something
of
it
in
its
diviner
aspects
to
know
love
in
its
beauty
greatness
and
power
to
free
it
from
ideas
of
grossness
and
evil
and
yet
to
retain
in
healthful
balance
and
poise
that
portion
of
our
nature
which
god
has
assigned
so
prominent
and
so
important
a
place
in
man
estate
of
present
happiness
and
the
future
prosperity
and
blessing
of
the
race
is
the
instant
duty
of
all
intelligent
men
and
women
both
young
and
old
conscientiously
to
relate
these
emotions
of
our
nature
to
the
highest
of
the
individual
and
the
race
and
to
redeem
the
purest
and
most
sacred
relation
of
life
from
the
realm
of
degradation
and
shame
to
disarm
and
depose
that
sensual
usurper
which
has
been
enthroned
and
worshiped
in
the
name
of
love
and
set
love
herself
upon
the
throne
fair
luminous
and
pure
to
gladden
to
bless
and
to
save
shall
be
both
our
effort
and
our
justification
chapter
ii
differences
of
sex
it
is
both
difficult
and
unnecessary
to
determine
which
is
the
superior
of
the
two
sexes
when
the
subject
is
regarded
in
its
true
light
there
is
no
superiority
upon
the
part
of
either
and
at
the
same
time
each
is
superior
to
the
other
in
the
sphere
in
which
god
designed
them
to
move
the
truth
was
perhaps
aptly
represented
by
president
lincoln
when
presented
at
the
same
time
with
two
hats
by
rival
hatters
both
hats
were
about
as
perfect
as
it
was
possible
for
human
skill
to
make
them
he
desired
to
recognize
this
perfection
in
both
and
yet
to
avoid
discrimination
in
favor
of
either
and
in
that
matchless
sufficiency
which
qualified
him
for
the
demands
of
almost
any
situation
lincoln
in
accepting
the
hats
said
gentlemen
your
hats
mutually
excel
each
other
the
same
is
true
of
men
and
women
they
mutually
excel
each
other
in
man
place
he
is
superior
and
in
woman
place
she
is
superior
the
wisdom
with
which
god
has
adapted
each
for
the
important
place
which
they
are
to
occupy
in
life
is
well
worth
our
thought
and
study
and
a
clear
apprehension
of
the
subject
will
help
to
remove
many
of
the
misunderstandings
estrangements
and
conflicts
which
so
frequently
arise
in
married
life
that
neither
is
superior
to
the
other
but
that
they
are
two
parts
of
one
complete
whole
segments
of
the
same
circle
and
that
their
union
is
absolutely
essential
to
unity
and
entirety
will
be
best
understood
as
we
study
what
these
differences
are
in
some
respects
man
is
inferior
to
woman
while
in
other
respects
woman
is
inferior
to
man
in
a
happy
marriage
these
differences
become
complemental
rendering
possible
that
superior
unity
in
which
the
two
are
made
one
let
us
note
what
some
of
these
differences
are
in
stature
woman
is
shorter
than
man
in
the
united
states
the
average
height
of
men
is
about
five
feet
eight
inches
and
the
weight
about
one
hundred
and
pounds
the
average
woman
is
about
five
feet
three
inches
in
height
and
about
one
hundred
and
pounds
in
weight
the
man
has
broad
shoulders
and
narrow
hips
while
woman
has
narrow
shoulders
and
broad
hips
her
shoulders
set
further
back
giving
her
breast
greater
depth
in
effecting
this
change
her
is
shorter
and
this
is
one
reason
why
she
can
not
throw
a
stone
or
ball
with
as
much
accuracy
as
man
in
man
the
muscles
are
well
defined
and
indicate
great
strength
while
in
woman
even
when
the
muscles
are
well
developed
the
outlines
are
more
hidden
by
fatty
and
cellular
tissues
which
fill
all
the
hollows
and
round
off
all
angles
giving
her
peculiar
grace
and
beauty
he
has
greater
muscular
force
but
she
has
more
power
of
endurance
the
bony
structure
of
woman
is
smaller
and
more
delicately
formed
the
angles
of
the
bones
are
less
projecting
and
the
joints
better
concealed
the
skull
is
smaller
and
the
bones
of
the
cranium
thinner
the
sternum
or
breastbone
is
shorter
and
flatter
and
the
clavicles
or
more
crooked
and
shorter
his
voice
is
deeper
and
more
guttural
hers
softer
and
more
musical
her
neck
is
longer
her
skin
softer
her
hair
less
generally
diffused
but
more
luxuriant
in
growth
than
in
man
the
most
noticeable
feature
in
the
study
of
the
differences
of
the
bony
structure
of
the
two
sexes
is
observable
in
the
pelvis
a
word
derived
from
the
greek
signifying
dish
or
bowl
in
man
this
structure
is
simply
to
subserve
the
purposes
of
strength
and
motion
in
woman
this
bony
basin
which
forms
the
lower
part
of
the
body
has
an
additional
purpose
of
special
importance
at
her
side
the
form
the
highest
points
and
from
these
the
pelvis
slopes
down
until
in
front
it
forms
a
comparatively
narrow
rim
called
the
pubic
arch
this
change
of
form
in
woman
is
designed
to
adapt
her
body
to
become
the
first
cradle
of
her
children
and
in
the
fullness
of
time
to
permit
the
easy
transit
of
a
new
being
into
the
outer
world
in
preparing
woman
for
maternity
god
has
thus
equipped
her
with
such
physical
adaptation
as
is
suited
to
the
carrying
of
her
temporary
burden
while
at
the
same
time
affording
protection
for
the
hidden
life
within
thus
fitting
the
physical
frame
of
woman
to
the
with
which
he
has
endowed
her
while
woman
is
thus
furnished
with
physical
requisites
suited
to
the
easiest
accomplishment
of
the
divine
purpose
while
the
form
of
her
body
the
articulation
of
her
bones
and
the
size
of
her
muscles
all
indicate
her
sense
of
dependence
upon
man
god
has
with
like
wisdom
adapted
man
in
all
of
his
physical
endowments
to
become
the
shield
and
defender
of
woman
he
is
to
be
her
protection
and
her
defense
his
fiercer
visage
his
broader
shoulders
his
more
muscular
frame
all
speak
clearly
of
the
divine
purpose
intellectually
as
well
as
physically
men
and
women
are
best
suited
for
their
respective
duties
and
responsibilities
in
life
in
arriving
at
a
conclusion
man
is
much
more
deliberate
and
logical
proceeding
step
by
step
after
an
orderly
method
while
woman
reaches
the
conclusion
in
much
less
time
by
means
of
her
intuition
while
woman
is
by
no
means
incapable
of
logical
deductions
yet
generally
she
does
not
stop
to
reason
it
out
but
takes
refuge
in
the
statement
that
she
knows
that
it
is
so
that
she
is
sure
that
she
is
right
it
is
easy
to
see
that
intellectually
as
well
as
physically
men
and
women
are
complemental
and
when
the
conclusions
arrived
at
are
identical
they
become
confirmatory
of
each
other
while
men
would
be
likely
to
prefer
the
conclusions
which
are
reached
by
their
own
method
yet
women
in
the
exercise
of
the
same
freedom
are
likely
to
prefer
the
intuitions
of
their
own
sex
for
either
to
decide
in
favor
of
the
intellectual
superiority
of
their
own
sex
would
be
somewhat
like
the
case
of
two
men
engaged
in
a
lawsuit
where
one
takes
it
upon
himself
to
become
umpire
and
decide
in
favor
of
himself
and
against
his
opponent
the
nervous
system
of
woman
is
more
refined
and
more
delicate
than
that
in
man
this
greater
nervous
sensibility
renders
her
more
susceptible
to

rendering
distasteful
to
her
all
things

sources
of

are
not

in

of
her

its
adornment
in
love
of
her

and
their
of

and

usually
surpasses

in

of

and

which
is
laid
upon
her
god
has
adequately
fitted
her
by
bestowing
a
compensating
power
of
endurance
if
we
desire
to
deny
woman
this
greater
sensitiveness
and
greater
endurance
we
would
need
to
ignore
the
patience
and
bravery
with
which
they
face
and
bear
the
pains
and
perils
of
maternity
pains
and
sufferings
of
which
they
assert
that
man
can
not
form
the
remotest
idea
but
there
are
also
other
differences
less
manifest
to
the
superficial
observer
but
none
the
less
real
and
important
to
those
who
would
comprehend
the
wonderful
wisdom
of
the
creator
and
intelligently
prepare
themselves
to
receive
the
good
which
is
designed
for
and
is
possible
to
intelligent
men
and
women
there
are
inherent
differences
of
character
and
modifications
of
temperament
which
can
be
best
understood
by
studying
the
very
earliest
manifestations
of
human
life
when
we
examine
the
sperm
of
the
male
and
the
ovum
of
the
female
as
seen
under
the
microscope
these
characteristics
are
not
imaginary
but
inherent
and
are
manifestly
designed
and
intended
by
the
creator
and
it
is
only
when
we
study
these
characteristics
in
their
entirety
with
a
desire
to
understand
the
divine
purpose
that
we
can
measurably
comprehend
how
these
individual
differences
in
each
contribute
to
the
blessing
and
the
of
both
the
part
contributed
by
the
mother
in
the
reproductive
act
toward
the
life
of
the
future
child
is
called
an
ovum
which
means
an
egg
for
all
forms
of
life
both
vegetable
and
animal
begin
with
a
seed
or
egg
which
are
two
names
for
the
same
thing
in
the
lower
forms
of
life
these
eggs
are
usually
produced
on
the
exterior
of
the
plant
while
in
the
higher
forms
of
life
as
for
instance
in
the
bird
the
seed
or
egg
is
produced
in
the
inside
of
the
body
and
after
being
perfected
is
expelled
to
be
hatched
in
a
nest
where
the
young
when
they
attain
their
proper
size
break
the
shell
and
emerge
into
the
outer
world
in
the
highest
forms
of
life
the
ovum
reaches
its
maturity
in
a
department
of
the
mother
body
which
is
called
the
ovary
in
woman
at
the
end
of
a
period
of
days
as
a
succeeding
ovum
ripens
it
passes
into
a
tube
which
awaits
its
reception
and
is
moved
onward
into
the
womb
where
it
remains
for
a
period
awaiting
the
reception
of
the
male
element
called
the
spermatozoa
this
is
the
plural
while
a
single
one
is
called
a
spermatozoön
the
ovum
or
egg
of
the
mother
is
so
small
that
two
hundred
and
forty
of
them
would
need
to
be
laid
side
by
side
in
order
to
make
a
row
one
inch
long
the
spermatozoön
the
principle
of
life
contributed
by
the
male
is
so
small
that
it
is
not
visible
to
the
eye
except
by
the
aid
of
a
microscope
and
when
seen
somewhat
resembles
a
pollywog
these
minute
centres
of
life
are
alive
and
move
in
a
fluid
which
is
secreted
by
the
male
organs
of
reproduction
and
which
is
generally
called
semen
now
if
we
study
the
characteristics
of
the
ovum
and
of
the
spermatozoön
we
may
be
surprised
when
we
discover
some
of
the
same
differences
which
characterize
men
and
women
from
infancy
to
old
age
in
passing
through
the
tube
which
is
to
carry
it
into
the
womb
from
that
portion
of
the
body
of
the
mother
where
it
has
attained
its
growth
and
perfection
the
ovum
is
passive
does
not
move
by
its
own
inherent
life
but
is
carried
forward
to
its
designed
place
by
the
movement
in
the
tube
itself
the
same
as
the
food
which
is
masticated
in
the
mouth
is
passed
on
to
the
stomach
not
by
any
action
in
the
food
itself
but
by
the
movement
of
the
esophagus
which
passes
it
onward
to
its
destined
place
in
the
stomach
in
other
words
the
ovum
is
passive
when
we
come
to
the
spermatozoa
or
sperm
of
the
male
we
find
an
entirely
different
manifestation
just
the
same
as
you
see
the
pollywog
moving
in
the
water
or
tiny
fish
swimming
about
in
the
pool
so
the
spermatozoa
move
with
activity
and
vigor
in
the
semen
and
when
this
has
been
transferred
to
the
interior
of
the
body
of
the
mother
in
the
manner
in
which
god
designed
it
retains
its
activity
moving
vigorously
about
in
the
upper
portion
of
the
vaginal
cavity
until
it
finds
the
entrance
into
the
womb
passing
through
and
above
the
cervix
it
continues
to
move
about
with
great
activity
until
it
finds
an
ovum
which
it
seeks
with
avidity
when
it
reaches
the
womb
if
there
is
no
ovum
present
it
may
remain
there
for
a
period
of
days
awaiting
its
arrival
or
may
find
its
way
into
one
of
the
fallopian
tubes
which
lead
out
to
the
ovary
and
even
go
in
quest
of
the
object
of
its
search
as
far
as
the
ovary
itself
these
little
creatures
of
an
inch
in
length
and
requiring
that
hundreds
of
them
should
be
laid
side
by
side
in
order
to
extend
one
single
inch
are
so
numerous
that
hundreds
of
them
exist
in
a
single
drop
of
semen
and
yet
a
single
one
is
all
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
fertilize
the
ovum
and
render
complete
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
while
the
ovum
is
passive
the
sperm
of
the
male
is
characterized
by
great
activity
and
remarkable
vitality
napheys
says
the
secretive
fluid
has
been
frozen
and
kept
at
a
temperature
of
zero
during
four
days
yet
when
it
was
thawed
these
animalcules
as
they
are
supposed
to
be
were
as
active
as
ever
in
her
interesting
book
entitled
life
and
love
margaret
warner
morley
says
under
the
microscope
these
active
forms
have
been
seen
eagerly
moving
around
and
around
the
egg
until
one
more
fortunate
than
the
rest
finds
admission
and
dissolves
into
the
substance
of
the
egg
not
to
be
finally
lost
however
for
as
we
know
this
inexplicable
union
results
in
the
growth
of
a
new
creature
like
neither
parent
and
yet
like
both
each
cell
having
given
to
the
new
life
certain
characteristics
of
the
creature
from
which
it
was
derived
this
greater
activity
of
the
sperm
is
seen
also
at
the
birth
of
the
child
for
physicians
tell
us
that
the
pulse
of
a
male
child
at
birth
beats
two
or
three
times
a
minute
faster
than
that
of
a
female
child
the
tissues
of
the
male
are
also
characterized
by
the
same
superior
activity
and
not
only
among
men
but
among
all
creatures
the
tissues
of
the
male
have
a
greater
tendency
to
change
than
those
of
the
female
in
the
very
fibre
of
her
structure
she
is
quiet
while
he
is
more
active
characterized
by
this
more
marked
vitality
more
sturdy
form
and
more
muscular
frame
we
would
naturally
expect
that
the
vitality
of
male
children
would
be
greater
than
that
of
female
children
but
this
is
not
the
case
it
is
claimed
by
some
good
authorities
that
about
five
per
cent
more
male
than
female
children
are
born
into
the
world
but
at
five
years
of
age
more
girls
are
alive
than
boys
and
what
may
seem
increasingly
strange
when
we
consider
the
greater
perils
to
which
the
life
of
women
is
exposed
in
childbearing
the
expectation
of
life
as
companies
designate
it
is
greater
in
woman
than
in
man
and
when
the
census
of
old
persons
is
taken
the
larger
number
of
them
are
women
the
civil
law
recognizes
this
more
passive
nature
of
females
and
the
more
intense
activity
of
males
by
regarding
the
man
as
the
criminal
in
all
actions
for
fornication
or
bastardy
while
public
sentiment
ostracizes
and
is
more
severe
and
unrelenting
with
the
woman
the
law
always
inflicts
its
penalty
upon
the
man

differences
of
sex
these
differences
in
temperament
indicate
the
infinite
wisdom
of
the
creator
and
to
any
thoughtful
observer
the
many
benefits
must
be
manifest
longfellow
in
his
hiawatha
says
as
unto
the
bow
the
cord
is
so
unto
the

though
she

him
she
obeys
him
though
she
draws

yet
she
follows
useless
each
without
the
other
woman
might
be
said
to
be
both
in
the
family
and
in
society
the
centripetal
force
insuring
permanency
attracting
and
drawing
to
herself
and
within
herself
thus
preventing
in
the
family
and
in
society
the
tendency
to
fly
from
the
centre
and
to
produce
chaos
man
is
life
centrifugal
force
the
impetuosity
and
velocity
of
his
nature
tend
to
throw
everything
from
the
centre
his
influence
is
to
prevent
gravitation
from
drawing
everything
to
a
given
point
where
all
would
become
a
state
of
rest
while
woman
keeps
life
stable
man
keeps
it
from
stagnation
but
it
requires
the
reciprocal
influence
of
each
to
secure
that
harmony
which
god
intended
woman
stability
unmodified
by
influence
would
tend
to
result
in
complete
rest
which
would
mean
stagnation
and
death
man
greater
impetuosity
would
lead
to
instability
unrest
and
possible
chaos
as
in
nature
the
centrifugal
and
centripetal
forces
equalize
and
balance
themselves
swaying
the
spheres
in
fixed
orbits
so
the
influences
of
men
and
women
upon
each
other
both
in
the
family
and
in
society
help
to
secure
and
maintain
an
even
balance
while
opposite
in
tendency
they
are
yet
of
equal
necessity
and
of
equal
value
each
is
essential
to
the
perfection
and
completeness
of
the
other
and
perfect
unity
is
only
secured
by
the
union
of
the
two
the
reciprocal
influences
of
men
and
women
are
oftentimes
noticed
in
old
couples
who
have
passed
thirty
or
forty
years
together
in
peace
and
harmony
each
living
year
after
year
under
the
moulding
power
of
the
other
and
each
being
moulded
by
the
surroundings
and
influences
which
have
wrought
upon
the
other
year
after
year
they
become
more
alike
in
form
feature
and
expression
their
views
and
opinions
become
increasingly
harmonized
until
there
comes
also
to
be
a
mental
resemblance
that
they
have
lived
in
the
midst
of
the
same
surroundings
and
breathed
the
same
air
have
eaten
the
same
kind
of
food
have
shared
each
other
joys
and
pleasures
have
laughed
and
wept
together
have
been
under
the
formative
influences
of
the
same
conditions
tend
in
a
measure
to
this
increasing
likeness
but
under
the
reciprocal
influences
each
has
lost
a
portion
of
this
more
pronounced
personality
and
taken
upon
himself
or
herself
the
physical
intellectual
and
moral
features
of
the
other
their
union
has
constantly
tended
to
unity
in
religious
matters
there
is
also
a
noticeable
difference
between
men
and
women
generally
woman
responds
more
readily
to
religious
teachings
and
influences
and
by
nature
she
manifestly
follows
the
leadings
more
closely
than
her
male
companion
and
there
are
good
reasons
evident
why
this
should
be
so
with
the
uninterrupted
duties
of
the
household
which
are
oftentimes
even
multiplied
on
sundays
it
is
necessary
that
a
moral
sense
correspondingly
more
acute
should
prompt
her
to
overcome
the
difficulties
which
beset
her
in
her
approach
to
the
sanctuary
and
god
has
given
her
that
added
moral
force
which
is
designed
to
enable
her
to
overcome
the
increased
resistance
which
she
meets
in
the
performance
of
her
religious
duties
there
are
times
also
when
in
the
discharge
of
her
special
duties
as
wife
and
mother
for
weeks
and
even
for
months
she
is
called
upon
to
minister
to
others
in
sickness
or
give
herself
to
the
care
of
infant
children
and
were
it
not
for
the
larger
endowment
of
her
devotional
nature
these
repeated
and
prolonged
but
enforced
absences
from
god
house
would
result
in
the
formation
of
a
fixed
habit
which
would
eventually
wholly
keep
the
majority
of
women
from
attendance
upon
all
religious
assemblies
but
in
view
of
the
important
fact
that
god
has
more
largely
entrusted
the
moral
and
religious
training
of
the
children
to
the
mother
we
need
to
think
but
for
a
moment
to
understand
what
would
be
the
result
if
her
own
nature
was
not
endowed
with
sufficient
strength
to
enable
her
to
overcome
every
barrier
and
to
rise
to
the
higher
plane
of
duty
and
responsibility
in
this
matter
the
exceptional
instances
of
mothers
who
are
themselves
deficient
in
their
moral
nature
and
neglectful
of
religious
duties
and
who
on
that
account
fail
utterly
in
the
moral
and
religious
training
of
their
children
are
quite
sufficient
to
illustrate
what
would
be
the
condition
in
the
home
in
the
church
the
community
and
the
state
if
god
had
not
endowed
woman
with
a
stronger
moral
nature
and
a
keener
sense
of
religious
obligation
than
is
found
in
man
it
is
by
this
more
active
moral
sense
in
woman
that
the
religious
poise
and
balance
of
the
family
is
maintained
and
its
benign
results
are
often
seen
not
only
in
the
children
but
in
the
husband
as
well
the
complemental
differences
in
the
intellectual
and
moral
natures
of
men
and
women
are
as
essential
to
the
highest
and
best
development
of
the
entire
nature
of
each
as
the
complemental
physical
and
sexual
differences
of
each
are
indispensable
to
that
union
in
which
the
two
are
made
one
in
the
child
which
is
begotten
of
the
father
and
born
of
the
mother
this
reflexive
and
reciprocal
influence
of
each
sex
upon
the
other
to
the
mutual
modification
and
advantage
of
both
is
clearly
seen
in
the
nation
as
well
as
in
the
life
of
the
family
this
thought
is
beautifully
presented
by
margaret
warner
morley
in
her
book
entitled
life
and
love
in
the
lower
life
and
in
savages
the
community
in
its
characteristics
approaches
the
masculine
type
it
is
selfish
egoistic
unstable
variable
the
herd
of
buffalo
for
illustration
roams
about
in
search
of
food
and
water
charging
relentlessly
and
destroying
whatever
enemy
comes
in
its
way
the
savage
tribe
often
has
no
fixed
abode
but
roams
about
from
place
to
place
where
it
has
a
home
it
is
as
a
rule
given
to
frequent
war
with
its
neighbors
and
is
liable
to
be
uprooted
by
a
stronger
foe
and
absorbed
and
thus
lost
or
it
may
be
destroyed
or
compelled
to
move
on
while
this
is
true
in
the
savage
community
a
that
is
considered
as
a
nation
a
unit
in
its
internal
organization
on
the
other
hand
it
is
essentially
in
its
characteristics
its
habits
are
simple
stable
not
liable
to
change
it
makes
no
inventions
elaborates
no
complex
machinery
in
civilized
life
the
opposite
characteristics
predominate
the
community
as
a
whole
constantly
takes
upon
itself
the
best
characteristics
of
the
feminine
type
it
becomes
stable
less
given
to
change
it
does
not
seek
war
but
prefers
peace
becomes
more
and
more
quiescent
and
altruistic
while
these
external
changes
are
discernible
corresponding
changes
take
place
in
the
national
life
the
civilized
nation
tends
to
move
away
from
the
feminine
toward
the
masculine
type
inventions
and
innovations
constantly
change
the
order
of
things
national
existence
is
established
but
the
existence
of
the
individual
calls
for
a
more
vigorous
struggle
competitions
become
fierce
and
the
struggle
between
labor
and
capital
becomes
more
intense
and
the
exertion
of
personal
energy
merges
into
an
effort
to
secure
prestige
and
place
wealth
and
power
consequently
the
higher
faculties
generally
obtain
their
larger
development
in
this
approach
toward
the
feminine
type
the
community
as
a
whole
parts
with
some
of
its
less
desirable
masculine
expressions
it
becomes
modified
less
angular
the
desire
for
war
departs
courage
remains
and
energy
finds
expression
in
new
and
nobler
directions
but
while
these
changes
are
taking

the
community
does
not
discard
all
its
masculine
characteristics
it
simply
parts
with
the
lower
or
least
desirable
of
each
while
the
best
elements
of
both
are
united
in
the
new

from

interesting
paragraphs
certain
changes
which
mark
the
advanced
community
as
a
whole
necessarily
and
in
no
less
degree
mark
the
individuals
composing
it
the
sexes
are
not
sharply
distinguished
from
each
other
in
the
intellectual
and
emotional
realms
on
the
whole
men
as
a
class
probably
show
a
preponderance
of
what
may
be
termed
masculine
characteristics
as
greater
egoism
variability
activity
but
these
masculine
characteristics
have
been
modified
lessened
so
to
speak
in
the
higher
type
of
man
the
best
and
highest
feminine
characteristics
have
been
fused
with
the
best
and
highest
masculine
characteristics
the
fighting
instinct
for
instance
has
become
moral
courage
the
tendency
to
vary
expresses
itself
in
great
intellectual
development
instability
and
restlessness
have
become
intellectual
rather
than
physical
qualities
leading
to
notable
inventions
and
discoveries
brave
and
gentle
strong
and
tender
inventive
and
patient
the
finest
type
of
man
owes
his
superiority
to
the
transforming
and
illuminating
power
of
his
inheritance
of
womanly
qualities
in
the
higher
type
of
woman
the

and
highest
masculine
characteristics
have
been
fused
with
the
best
and
highest
development
of
the
feminine
characteristics
altruism
for
instance
has
been
rationalized
and
guarded
by
the
exercise
of
greater
reasoning
power
stability
or
inertia
has
been
lessened
and
prevented
from
forming
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
progress
the
tendency
to
vary
has
been
strengthened
the
more
negative
nature
has
progressed
to
a
more
positive
condition
courage
inventiveness
and
greater
strength
of
intellectual
perception
have
been
fostered
in
civilized
woman
her
submission
to
man
gradually
lessens
before
the
upward
progress
of
her
mind
she
places
herself
as
his
equal
as
the
other
half
without
which
his
can
not
be
complete
nor
does
this
borrowing
of
the
characteristics
of
each
by
the
other
mean
the
merging
of
the
two
sexes
into
one
the
obliteration
of
sex
difference
and
hence
of
sex
attraction
it
means
the
elevation
of
man
by
developing
his
masculine
qualities
in
the
direction
of
their
highest
possibilities
and
by
adding
to
manhood
a
new
charm
a
subtle
grace
an
irresistible
beauty
it
means
the
elevation
of
woman
by
the
development
of
her
womanly
qualities
in
the
direction
of
their
highest
possibilities
and
by
adding
to
womanhood
a
new
power
a
deeper
more
sympathy
an
ineffable
glow
and
a
nobler
beauty
the
mind
is
a
mighty
solvent
through
it
the
two
sexes
have
been
united
in
an
intellectual
union
from
which
has
been
born
a
new
man
with
the
dominant
masculine
characteristics
developed
in
the
noblest
direction
and
enriched
by
union
with
feminine
characteristics
and
a
new
woman
with
the
feminine
characteristics
grandly
developed
and
enhanced
by
what
was
once
in
the
province
of
masculine
knowledge
and
activity
in
harmony
with
what
we
have
been
considering
in
this
chapter
it
is
eminently
proper
to
discuss
briefly
the
reciprocal
sexual
tempers
and
tendencies
of
married
men
and
women
while
the
discussion
of
the
various
modifications
of
these
differences
does
not
belong
to
this
chapter
yet
the
recognition
of
the
fact
itself
and
a
noting
of
the
beneficial
reactionary
and
reciprocal
effects
are
in
place
just
at
this
point
the
active
nature
of
the
sperm
of
the
male
and
the
passivity
which
distinguishes
the
ovum
of
the
female
characterize
the
two
sexes
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
their
existence
the
greater
activity
of
the
sperm
the
quickened
pulse
of
the
male
child
at
birth
the
more
restless
nature
of
the
his
running
climbing
active
life
throughout
childhood
and
adolescence
these
traits
characterize
not
only
his
boyhood
his
days
of
developing
manhood
but
his
marital
relations
as
well
with
rare
exceptions
both
of
person
and
of
instances
in
married
life
all
the
sexual
aggressiveness
is
with
the
male
wives
seldom
seek
the
closer
embraces
of
their
husbands
they
are
generally
indifferent
often
absolutely
averse
with
the
husband
while
in
perfect
health
the
conditions
are
quite
the
opposite
and
the
wisdom
of
the
creator
is
manifest
in
the
fact
that
were
the
wife
equally
quickened
by
the
same
amative
tendencies
the
male
nature
would
be
called
into
such
frequent
and
continuous
exercise
that
the
power
of
reproduction
would
be
either
totally
destroyed
or
so
impaired
that
the
race
would
degenerate
into
moral
intellectual
and
physical
pigmies
god
has
made
the
passivity
of
the
wife
the
protection
of
her
husband
and
a
source
of
manifold
blessing
to
their
children
upon
the
other
hand
her
uninterrupted
and
entire
neglect
of
the
sexual
relation
is
wisely
overcome
to
the
advantage
of
the
wife
by
her
husband
greater
sexual
activity
while
at
the
same
time
her
restraining
passiveness
is
made
his
safeguard
and
security
each
brings
into
the
married
relation
inclinations
and
propensities
which
are
to
modify
the
other
to
the
mutual
benefit
of
both
if
husbands
and
wives
only
knew
and
adequately
realized
these
facts
and
harmonized
their
thought
and
conduct
toward
each
other
accordingly
much
of
the
discord
estrangement
and
consequent
unhappiness
in
married
life
would
be
eliminated
and
disappear
when
both
alike
recognize
these
differences
and
the
wisdom
which
has
made
them
to
differ
and
when
each
is
willing
to
accept
the
modifying
influence
of
the
other
in
the
manner
in
which
god
has
intended
the
discord
and
misery
which
blight
thousands
of
lives
and
destroy
such
multitudes
of
homes
will
give
place
to
a
benediction
and
blessing
which
will
restore
to
earth
a
larger
measure
of
the
happiness
of
eden
but
before
closing
this
chapter
upon
the
complemental
differences
between
the
two
sexes
it
will
be
interesting
to
observe
some
remarkable
similarities
in
the
reproductive
organs
themselves
and
to
note
how
in
that
infinite
wisdom
which
is
marvelous
in
our
eyes
god
has
so
modified
their
form
and
office
that
the
external
organs
of
reproduction
in
man
become
the
internal
and
seemingly
different
organs
of
reproduction
in
woman
to
understand
the
full
significance
of
what
we
have
briefly
to
say
upon
this
subject
it
will
be
well
to
recall
the
fact
that
in
man
and
animals
even
those
physical
characteristics
which
may
be
regarded
as
strictly
feminine
are
present
in
a
rudimentary
form
in
the
male
and
let
a
single
instance
suffice
the
paps
and
breasts
of
the
male
are
but
the
diminutive
and
dormant
breasts
and
nipples
of
the
female
and
this
is
true
not
only
with
man
but
with
the
lower
animals
the
male
not
only
simulates
but
really
possesses
in
rudimentary
form
all
the
parts
and
powers
which
characterize
the
fuller
development
in
the
opposite
sex
that
this
is
true
is
demonstrated
by
the
cases
of
abnormal
sexual
development
which
at
long
intervals
are
born
in
different
lands
and
by
the
occasional
instances
in
heathen
countries
where
old
men
after
prolonged
stimulation
of
the
breasts
are
made
effectively
to
serve
as
nurses
for
infants
as
the
pelvic
bone
in
man
and
woman
is
modified
by
the
various
changes
of
form
which
adapt
it
to
the
different
necessities
of
each
sex
so
in
a
large
measure
are
the
reproductive
organs
primarily
the
same
in
men
and
women
if
you
enlarge
the
curve
of
the
pelvic
frontal
then
press
the
scrotum
or
sack
of
the
male
upward
into
the
body
it
will
correspond
to
the
vagina
and
the
womb
of
the
female
move
the
testicles
to
the
right
and
the
left
and
you
have
their
counterparts
the
ovaries
while
the
spermatic
cords
form
the
fallopian
tubes
for
the
passage
of
the
completely
formed
ovum
from
the
ovaries
to
the
womb
without
materially
disturbing
its
position
diminish
the
sexual
member
of
the
male
and
you
have
the
clitoris
of
the
female
it
is
readily
seen
that
with
these
changes
of
position
together
with
slight
modifications
of
form
and
function
those
parts
which
to
the
unobservant
and
the
unthoughtful
seem
wholly
different
in
the
two
sexes
are
after
all
discovered
to
be
only
diversified
forms
of
the
same
thing
but
this
very
fact
however
invests
the
study
of
this
subject
with
increased
interest
and
displays
in
an
unexpected
manner
the
wonderful
wisdom
which
characterizes
everything
that
god
has
created
for
as
these
organs
take
upon
themselves
the
modifications
of
either
sex
every
other
organ
and
faculty
that
together
constitute
the
individual
must
be
so
modified
as
to
adjust
the
physical
intellectual
social
and
moral
natures
into
harmonious
unity
of
personality
chapter
iv
essentials
in
husband
and
home
before
writing
of
what
a
young
husband
ought
to
know
with
regard
to
his
wife
and
his
children
subjects
which
are
to
engage
our
thought
in
part
second
and
part
third
it
is
important
that
we
should
carefully
consider
some
matters
which
he
ought
to
know
concerning
himself
for
his
future
happiness
and
usefulness
as
well
will
be
quite
as
much
dependent
upon
the
mental
physical
and
moral
equipment
which
he
personally
brings
to
the
union
as
the
endowments
and
qualifications
which
are
possessed
by
his
partner
and
companion
if
your
wife
is
to
have
a
fair
chance
for
a
pleasant
home
and
a
happy
and
useful
life
she
will
need
a
husband
who
can
sacrifice
his
personal
luxuries
and
in
order
that
he
may
share
with
her
and
the
family
the
comforts
and
blessings
of
their
home
a
man
who
will
scorn
the
saloon
avoid
the
club
remain
away
from
the
lodge
give
up
his
cigar
and
spend
his
time
and
his
money
for
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
his
family
there
are
hundreds
of
homes
which
are
rendered
unhappy
and
in
many
senses
miserable
because
of
the
neglect
and
want
which
are
due
wholly
to
the
selfishness
and
lack
of
consideration
upon
the
part
of
the
husband
if
you
wish
to
preserve
and
perpetuate
that
which
is
noblest
and
best
in
your
wife
and
your
children
you
can
only
do
so
by
making
your
home
the
centre
of
your
thought
and
by
making
your
loved
ones
the
sharers
of
your
purse
and
your
pleasures
if
you
wish
them
to
live
for
your
comfort
and
happiness
they
have
an
equal
right
to
expect
you
to
live
and
sacrifice
for
their
comfort
and
happiness
almost
any
promising
bride
may
soon
be
made
an
wife
a
discontented
homekeeper
and
an
indifferent
mother
by
an
improvident
extravagant
selfish
and
neglectful
husband
in
most
instances
ruined
homes
come
principally
from
drink
idleness
bad
temper
shiftlessness
and
thriftless
habits
brutal
husbands
slatternly
wives
and
christless
living
do
your
duty
faithfully
to
your
wife
and
your
children
and
then
if
home
and
happiness
are
wrecked
the
responsibility
will
not
rest
upon
you
in
woman
the
love
of
home
is
usually
more
dominant
than
in
man
by
cultivating
this
in
yourself
you
will
produce
a
harmony
of
thought
and
purpose
which
will
contribute
greatly
to
the
comfort
and
of
both
adorn
your
home
with
your
own
hands
beautify
the
lawn
the
shrubbery
and
all
external
surroundings
it
matters
not
how
great
your
wealth
or
how
small
your
purse
every
consideration
effort
and
sacrifice
you
make
in
these
directions
will
add
to
your
own
health
and
happiness
and
endear
you
to
your
wife
in
the
development
of
this
common
interest
you
may
secure
in
your
own
experience
and
the
experience
of
your
wife
that
happiness
which
is
so
manifest
in
springtime
in
the
united
industry
of
the
two
robins
as
they
mold
and
fashion
the
nest
together
moved
by
a
common
impulse
and
the
premonition
of
the
birdlings
that
are
soon
to
be
be
devoted
keep
up
your
courtship
remember
and
repeat
the
little
attentions
which
gave
you
pleasure
months
and
years
ago
simply
because
you
knew
that
they
were
a
source
of
pleasure
to
the
one
whom
you
coveted
as
your
bride
and
companion
for
life
how
can
your
wife
love
and
respect
you
if
you
neglect
and
forsake
her
during
your
courtship
the
club
the
lodge
and
the
society
of
others
had
to
accept
second
place
you
preferred
her
company
to
that
of
all
others
if
you
are
to
her
and
she
to
you
what
each
should
be
this
preference
of
the
one
for
the
society
and
companionship
of
the
other
will
continue
throughout
life
your
home
will
be
your
clubhouse
and
no
society
or
gilded
hall
or
corner
grocery
with
its
lounging
company
will
be
able
to
attract
you
from
her
and
from
your
home
most
men
who
frequent
these
places
are
attracted
there
but
some
go
there
because
repelled
from
their
homes
there
are
women
whose
inconsiderate
treatment
of
their
husbands
repels
them
from
their
families
and
their
homes
and
the
husbands
simply
resort
to
the
club
or
other
place
of
assemblage
in
their
natural
search
for
a
place
of
refuge
and
fellowship
but
such
instances
are
the
exception
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
fault
is
largely
if
not
wholly
with
the
husband
oftentimes
his
conduct
is
due
to
his
thoughtlessness
but
more
frequently
to
pure
selfishness
recently
the
writer
called
at
the
home
of
a
mechanic
to
secure
his
services
in
a
job
of
work
it
was
between
eight
and
nine
in
the
evening
and
quite
dark
for
some
time
no
one
answered
our
knock
finally
a
young
wife
looking
pale
weary
and
lonely
bearing
a
large
lamp
in
one
hand
and
a
small
child
on
the
other
arm
opened
the
door
of
the
desolate
home
we
had
a
right
to
expect
to
find
the
husband
and
father
at
home
but
no
to
our
inquiry
we
were
told
that
we
would
likely
find
him
at
the
the
or
the
grocery
unless
indications
were
deceptive
here
was
a
case
of
cold
indifference
and
selfish
neglect
would
that
this
were
a
rare
instance
but
there
are
thousands
of
such
in
all
circles
of
society
in
our
cities
and
towns
and
in
the
country
as
well
we
clip
the
following
suggestive
incident
and
submit
it
as
pertinent
at
this
place
home
shall
be
my
clubhouse
said
a
young
unmarried
when
returning
from
a
visit
to
a
former
friend
who
had
married
and
lived
in
a
pleasant
home
almost
the
first
words
the
latter
spoke
as
his
visitor
seated
himself
in
the
parlor
was
want
you
to
go
over
with
me
and
see
our
nice
new
clubrooms
but
i
did
not
come
to
see
them
was
the
reply
i
came
to
see
you
and
your
family
that
you
can
do
anyhow
was
the
response
so
please
get
ready
and
we
will
go
over
and
spend
the
evening
there
with
a
nice
lot
of
friends
further
protest
seemed
ungracious
so
the
visitor
yielded
hour
after
hour
passed
by
and
it
was
midnight
before
the
visitor
could
induce
his
host
who
was
beginning
to
feel
the
effects
of
a
night
drinking
and
revelry
to
accompany
him
to
his
home
in
the
morning
the
host
who
evidently
felt
that
nothing
had
transpired
at
the
clubrooms
that
could
be
objected
to
asked
his
friend
what
is
your
opinion
of
our
clubroom
accommodations
the
rooms
are
very
nicely
furnished
was
the
rather
evasive
reply
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
did
you
enjoy
yourself
in
them
as
further
evasion
was
useless
the
guest
said
are
asking
me
a
plain
question
and
i
will
answer
it
frankly
i
am
a
single
man
and
expect
soon
to
get
married
if
i
continue
to
prosper
i
intend
to
settle
down
in
a
comfortable
home
and
spend
my
evenings
with
my
wife
and
my
children
as
for
your
clubrooms
if
i
wanted
to
neglect
my
family
and
my
business
and
perhaps
go
to
ruin
i
think
i
could
soon
bring
about
that
result
by
spending
my
evenings
in
your
clubrooms
and
i
am
more
resolved
than
ever
that
when
i
am
once
married
my
home
shall
be
my
clubhouse
now
we
would
not
seem
to
indicate
that
the
only
proper
place
for
the
husband
is
in
the
house
that
he
should
not
go
out
in
the
evening
for
diversion
social
fellowship
or
recreation
not
at
all
these
things
are
often
necessary
for
his
health
his
happiness
and
his
but
are
they
not
as
essential
to
the
health
the
happiness
and
of
the
wife
as
of
the
husband
if
he
seeks
diversion
in
the
evenings
let
it
be
where
his
wife
may
accompany
him
and
share
whatever
benefits
he
enjoys
if
family
duties
or
the
care
of
children
render
it
impossible
for
both
to
leave
home
at
the
same
time
then
manifestly
it
is
the
duty
of
the
husband
to
divide
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
with
the
wife
and
if
the
husband
has
the
true
the
privilege
of
frequently
remaining
at
home
to
spend
the
evening
with
his
children
will
afford
more
pleasure
and
more
profit
than
could
be
secured
elsewhere
the
husband
should
plan
and
arrange
to
give
his
wife
a
proper
amount
of
relaxation
and
diversion
the
limitations
of
her
restricted
life
make
recreation
and
relaxation
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
good
health
and
a
cheerful
disposition
but
in
all
your
planning
and
arrangements
remember
that
relaxation
and
diversion
may
be
secured
within
the
home
as
well
as
without
and
can
be
there
enjoyed
by
the
children
also
and
by
others
who
may
chance
to
share
the
home
with
you
if
you
and
your
wife
have
true
and
you
will
prefer
home
and
the
companionship
of
your
children
to
any
other
place
and
to
the
company
of
any
other
person
or
persons
faithful
husbands
and
wives
and
parents
will
need
no
specific
directions
in
these
matters
they
will
know
how
to
care
for
their
children
and
at
the
same
time
not
sacrifice
health
and
cheeriness
these
are
important
subjects
for
the
thoughtful
consideration
of
young
husbands
and
older
ones
also
and
while
upon
this
matter
it
may
be
well
for
those
of
us
who
are
too
apt
to
delegate
to
the
wife
the
whole
duty
of
making
the
home
cheery
and
happy
to
read
and
think
upon
the
following
from
the
pen
of
isaac
farrar
how
do
you
go
home
to
your
wife
after
business
hours
do
you
not
frequently
find
a
tired
woman
who
has
been
so
hard
at
work
all
day
with
the
care
of
three
or
four
babies
and
an
incompetent
hired
girl
that
she
has
found
no
time
to
make
an
afternoon
toilet
to
meet
you
as
you
would
like
to
have
her
on
your
return
try
and
be
a
sympathizing
husband
now
embrace
your
faithful
wife
and
say
to
her
mind
my
dear
i
home
early
come
now
go
and
rest
yourself
while
i
put
little
clarence
and
addie
to
bed
and
if
frank
comes
in
for
his
supper
i
will
tell
bridget
what
to
get
for
him
are
you
mindful
of
draughts
and
slamming
doors
while
she
takes
her
rest
for
an
hour
or
so
and
can
you
not
induce
her
to
take
that
rest
every
day
remember
her
days
are
long
just
as
busy
and
more
full
of
petty
cares
than
yours
a
woman
is
required
to
be
everything
from
a
reception
committee
to
receive
calls
in
the
parlor
to
a
nurse
in
the
nursery
and
a
chief
executive
in
the
kitchen
while
a
business
man
devotes
himself
to
a
single
trade
or
profession
when
you
undertake
to
entertain
your
wife
the
evenings
you
are
at
home
do
not
have
too
much
to
say
about
the
of
money
for
perhaps
in
her
particular
case
she
knows
as
much
about
that
as
you
do
and
if
the
wood
and
coal
bills
are
larger
every
year
remember
that
your
family
is
larger
as
well
and
do
not
tell
her
the
general
dislike
you
have
for
children
unless
they
are
angels
for
they
can
not
quite
be
angels
during
their
stay
here
on
earth
when
the
children
are
in
bed
and
the
house
quiet
do
not
seat
yourself
in
the
easy
chair
and
read
the
newspaper
to
yourself
from
editorials
to
market
reports
as
if
it
contained
nothing
that
would
interest
an
intelligent
woman
newspapers
read
in
selfish
solitude
by
thoughtless
husbands
have
made
the
within
the
lute
in
more
than
one
happy
home
how
many
anecdotes
and
stories
do
you
tell
your
wife
to
provoke
a
smile
or
a
laugh
how
many
roses
or
pinks
do
you
pin
on
your
coat
and
how
many
do
you
bring
home
to
her
are
you
careful
of
your
own
appearance
in
the
long
evenings
when
there
is
no
other
woman
but
her
to
be
captivated
by
your
manly
charms
i
am
inclined
to
believe
there
is
more
excuse
for
her
if
her
dress
has
not
been
changed
her
hair
made
tidy
than
there
is
for
you
most
noble
husband
perhaps
you
never
gave
it
a
thought
but
do
not
excuse
your
indifference
and
neglect
of
fond
attentions
for
they
are
just
as
dear
to
that
careworn
wife
of
yours
at
or
even
fifty
years
as
at
when
you
promised
her
that
you
would
be
true
and
faithful
to
her
through
life
journey
have
you
honorably
kept
your
word
your
answer
may
be
wife
knows
i
love
her
and
that
enough
she
may
know
it
but
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
assured
of
now
and
then
and
if
there
were
more
everyday
assurances
there
would
be
fewer
careless
wives
it
is
the
nature
of
all
women
to
love
to
be
wooed
and
won
and
after
marriage
the
same
nature
craves
attention
tenderness
and
the
expression
of
appreciation
affection
and
love
no
man
even
if
he
were
so
sordid
and
selfish
as
to
be
moved
by
no
less
base
or
no
more
worthy
motive
than
the
satisfaction
of
his
own
sensual
nature
and
consideration
for
his
own
personal
comfort
could
afford
to
withhold
the
expression
of
at
least
some
measure
of
thoughtful
consideration
and
attention
but
any
home
in
which
such
feelings
have
to
be
feigned
because
they
can
not
truly
be
felt
is
one
in
which
commiseration
and
pity
need
to
have
a
large
place
should
you
ever
note
upon
the
part
of
your
own
wife
the
slightest
manifestation
of
indifference
and
estrangement
put
away
from
your
lips
and
even
from
your
heart
all
words
of
reproof
and
reproach
and
try
again
the
methods
that
enabled
you
to
win
the
affections
of
your
wife
months
and
years
ago
we
grant
you
that
there
are
some
women
who
are
regular
xantippes
whom
no
philosopher
can
manage
of
whom
we
have
given
illustrious
examples
in
the
lives
of
some
eminent
men
in
the
preceding
volume
but
let
us
hope
that
they
are
not
numerous
there
are
men
and
not
a
few
of
them
we
fear
who
are
doomed
to
disappointment
in
marriage
it
does
not
take
them
long
to
discover
the
discrepancy
between
what
they
thought
marriage
to
be
and
what
it
really
is
they
soon
regard
this
union
a
mistake
and
in
a
few
years
and
some
even
in
a
few
months
denounce
marriage
as
a
failure
the
truth
is
that
the
sole
and
only
failure
is
found
in
the
mistaken
and
unworthy
views
held
concerning
marriage
by
one
or
both
parties
to
the
contract
marriage
is
no
failure
but
these
men
are
themselves
the
failures
they
belong
to
a
class
who
hold
most
degraded
views
concerning
woman
and
her
relation
to
her
husband
in
marriage
they
regard
woman
as
having
been
created
solely
to
gratify
the
unbridled
lust
of
man
they
married
with
the
idea
that
in
such
a
union
the
grossest
lust
would
have
the
sanction
of
law
and
that
in
the
marriage
ceremony
the
wife
relinquished
all
right
to
her
own
body
and
for
the
satisfaction
of
wearing
the
white
veil
and
carrying
a
bouquet
of
flowers
consented
to
surrender
to
him
not
only
her
rights
but
her
sense
of
decency
as
well
these
men
who
stare
decency
out
of
countenance
upon
the
street
who
lay
traps
for
the
ruin
of
innocent
and
unsuspecting
girls
who
invade
the
sanctity
of
home
and
whose
course
through
life
is
like
the
slimy
trail
of
a
venomous
serpent
are
unfit
for
marriage
they
are
unfit
to
be
regarded
even
as
men
no
man
it
matters
not
how
full
his
bank
account
or
how
fine
his
clothes
if
he
holds
these
low
views
of
woman
and
of
the
wife
place
in
the
marriage
relation
is
worthy
of
a
wife
for
he
dishonors
his
own
mother
and
sisters
dishonors
every
man
and
his
maker
as
well
any
man
who
has
in
him
the
seeds
of
such
unworthy
sentiments
may
be
sure
that
even
though
they
may
be
hidden
during
the
earlier
years
they
will
soon
grow
and
hasten
to
a
harvest
of
terrible
fruitage
the
happiness
of
many
homes
is
wrecked
in
the
early
struggle
to
determine
whether
the
will
of
the
wife
or
the
will
of
the
husband
shall
have
we
have
even
heard
brides
boasting
that
in
trivial
matters
they
contended
with
their
husbands
in
order
to
teach
them
from
the
very
beginning
that
they
did
not
propose
to
recognize
any
superior
right
in
the
husband
to
direct
or
as
they
said
to
boss
it
over
them
brides
often
object
to
the
word
obey
in
the
marriage
service
and
instead
of
using
the
words
love
honor
and
obey
the
substitution
is
often
made
of
love
honor
and
cherish
or
reverence
if
the
word
obey
is
understood
by
the
husband
to
mean
imperious
domination
then
it
had
better
be
universally
expunged
yet
nevertheless
there
is
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
the
declaration
of
napoleon
that
he
would
rather
have
his
army
in
command
of
one
poor
general
than
of
two
good
ones
the
careful
execution
of
an
ordinary
plan
is
much
better
than
that
which
comes
as
the
result
of
divergent
views
and
conflicting
opinions
in
an
address
delivered
before
the
first
national
congress
of
mothers
held
in
washington
hamilton
cushing
the
chief
of
the
ethnological
department
of
the
government
gave
a
very
interesting
account
of
the
custom
among
the
zuni
indians
who
recognize
the
of
the
female
in
everything
the
men
are
not
even
allowed
to
hold
or
to
have
any
right
in
property
other
than
through
their
wives
mothers
or
sisters
in
many
marriage
unions
the
wife
is
easily
the
intellectual
superior
of
her
husband
but
the
universal
custom
among
civilized
nations
is
to
recognize
the
husband
as
the
head
of
the
house
this
is
the
christian
idea
and
the
plain
teaching
of
scripture
not
however
in
that
mistaken
sense
which
is
so
often
intended
when
the
words
are
quoted
the
husband
is
the
head
of
the
wife
the
scriptures
nowhere
justify
a
husband
in
assuming
imperious
domination
over
his
wife
he
is
the
head
of
the
wife
but
in
that
loving
considerate
sense
even
as
christ
is
the
head
of
the
church
the
scriptural
teaching
is
so
important
and
so
beautiful
that
we
insert
here
in
their
entirety
two
of
the
principal
selections
upon
this
subject
that
which
relates
to
the
wife
we
have
printed
in
italics
and
that
which
relates
to
the
husband
we
have
printed
in
small
capitals
but
to
understand
the
relation
of
these
two
truths
it
is
necessary
that
the
reader
should
note
carefully
the
entire
context
paul
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
his
letter
to
the
ephesians
from
the
to
the
verse
writes
as
follows
submit
yourselves
unto
your
own
husbands
as
unto
the
lord
for
the
husband
is
the
head
of
the
wife
even
as
christ
is
the
head
of
the
church
and
he
is
the
saviour
of
the
body
therefore
as
the
church
is
subject
unto
christ
so
let
the
wives
be
to
their
own
husbands
in
husbands
love
your
wives
even
as
christ
also
loved
the
church
and
gave
himself
for
it
that
he
might
sanctify
and
cleanse
it
with
the
washing
of
water
by
the
word
that
he
might
present
it
to
himself
a
glorious
church
not
having
spot
or
wrinkle
or
any
such
thing
but
that
it
should
be
holy
and
without
blemish
so
ought
men
to
love
their
wives
as
their
own
bodies
he
that
loveth
his
own
wife
loveth
himself
for
no
man
ever
yet
hated
his
own
flesh
but
nourisheth
and
cherisheth
it
even
as
the
lord
the
church
for
we
are
members
of
his
body
of
his
flesh
and
of
his
bones
for
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
mother
and
shall
be
joined
unto
his
wife
and
they
two
shall
be
one
flesh
this
is
a
great
mystery
but
i
speak
concerning
christ
and
the
church
nevertheless
let
every
one
of
you
in
particular
so
love
his
wife
even
as
himself
and
the
wife
see
that
she
reverence
her
husband
here
is
clearly
and
beautifully
set
forth
the
correct
relative
in
the
home
it
is
the
wife
recognizing
the
headship
of
her
husband
as
the
church
recognizes
the
headship
leadership
and
authority
of
christ
upon
the
part
of
the
husband
his
headship
is
to
be
exercised
in
the
spirit
of
that
abounding
love
which
led
the
son
of
god
to
the
sacrifice
of
himself
both
during
his
life
and
in
his
atoning
death
for
the
salvation
and
blessing
of
that
body
of
believers
who
constitute
the
christian
church
the
teachings
of
peter
in
his
first
general
letter
or
epistle
in
the
third
chapter
from
the
first
to
the
seventh
verse
is
as
follows
likewise
ye
be
in
subjection
to
your
own
that
if
any
obey
not
the
word
they
also
may
without
the
word
be
won
by
the
conversation
of
the
wives
while
they
behold
your
chaste
conversation
coupled
with
fear
whose
adorning
let
it
not
be
that
outward
adorning
of
plaiting
the
hair
and
of
wearing
of
gold
or
of
putting
on
of
apparel
but
let
it
be
the
hidden
man
of
the
heart
in
that
which
is
not
corruptible
even
the
ornament
of
a
meek
and
quiet
spirit
which
is
in
the
sight
of
god
of
great
price
for
after
this
manner
in
the
old
time
the
holy
women
also
who
trusted
in
god
adorned
themselves
being
in
subjection
unto
their
own
husbands
even
as
sarah
obeyed
abraham
calling
him
lord
whose
daughters
ye
are
as
long
as
ye
do
well
and
are
not
afraid
with
any
amazement
likewise
ye
husbands
dwell
with
them
according
to
knowledge
giving
honor
unto
the
wife
as
unto
the
weaker
vessel
and
as
being
heirs
together
of
the
grace
of
life
that
your
prayers
be
not
hindered
here
the
teaching
is
also
very
beautiful
and
impressive
the
wife
is
to
be
in
subjection
to
a
considerate
and
loving
christian
husband
because
it
is
her
privilege
and
honor
but
even
though
her
husband
be
no
christian
one
who
obeys
not
the
word
still
she
is
to
recognize
and
conform
to
this
teaching
to
the
end
that
by
her
consistent
christian
deportment
and
that
adorning
of
the
hidden
man
of
the
heart
which
is
to
be
exhibited
in
a
meek
and
quiet
spirit
she
may
win
him
to
a
life
with
christ
the
husband
is
to
dwell
with
his
wife
according
to
knowledge
not
in
ignorance
of
the
peculiar
organs
and
functions
of
her
reproductive
nature
for
peter
here
manifestly
refers
specially
to
this
for
with
wonderful
beauty
he
lifts
the
marital
relation
into
a
holy
and
sacred
light
by
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
husband
and
the
wife
are
together
of
the
grace
of
in
other
words
god
has
taken
his
power
as
the
creator
of
life
think
of
it
as
creator
and
made
the
husband
and
the
wife
joint
heirs
together
of
this
grace
or
gift
of
creative
power
which
power
they
call
into
exercise
in
the
act
of
reproduction
surely
intelligence
and
reverence
are
essential
both
in
the
husband
and
in
the
wife
in
order
that
they
may
dwell
together
according
to
knowledge
it
would
scarcely
seem
necessary
to
enjoin
industry
as
an
essential
to
happiness
in
married
life
and
yet
the
happiness
of
many
homes
is
wrecked
on
the
rocks
of
ease
and
idleness
an
idle
person
is
like
the
ship
that
simply
floats
upon
the
seas
without
a
cargo
and
without
a
destination
there
are
ten
thousand
directions
to
shipwreck
but
only
one
course
that
will
bring
the
mariner
to
any
desired
port
in
safety
in
making
labor
essential
god
conferred
a
great
blessing
upon
man
the
idle
man
is
an
unhappy
man
and
the
idle
woman
is
an
unhappy
woman
industry
is
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
good

whatever
of
incentive
the
past
may
have
lacked
no
young
husband
unless
he
is
without
true
manhood
can
look
into
the
face
of

devoted

without
being
inspired
by
the
obligation
which
rests
upon
him
to
make
adequate
provision
for
every
present
need
and
future
emergency
his
energy
his
effort
his
wisdom
are
largely
to
determine
not
only
the
present
and
future
but
also
the
temporal
and
eternal
destiny
of
those
who
gather
in

let
these
be
your
inspiration
not
all
men
can
amass
wealth
nor
is
this
essential
remember
there
are
many
things
secured
by
industry
and
effort
which
are
more
precious
than
gold
while
a
competence
is
desirable
large
wealth
is
seldom
a
great
blessing
there
is
a
world
of
sound
philosophy
in
the
declaration
of
a
very
rich
man
who
said
i
worked
like
a
slave
until
i
was
forty
to
make
my
fortune
and
i
have
been
watching
it
like
a
detective
ever
since
for
which
i
have
received
only
my
lodging
food
and
clothes
a
noble
purpose
seconded
by
manly
endeavor
will
secure
for
your
heart
and
your
home
what
wealth
can
not
purchase
we
would
be
alike
untrue
to
your
best
interests
and
unfaithful
to
him
who
has
called
us
to
the
delicate
and
difficult
task
we
have
undertaken
in
the
preparation
of
these
pages
did
we
not
say
something
concerning
that
which
is
highest
and
best
in
you
and
which
the
creator
designed
should
dominate
over
every
other
department
of
your
nature
namely
the
religious
or
moral
nature
if
you
want
your
wife
to
be
happy
do
not
ask
her
to
struggle
onward
and
upward
alone
in
the
christian
life
she
will
be
lonely
if
the
dearest
of
earthly
friends
is
unwilling
to
travel
heavenward
with
her
you
will
double
her
difficulties
if
in
your
life
and
example
you
deny
the
correctness
of
her
precepts
and
her
life
even
if
you
propose
to
yourself
a
life
of
moral
rectitude
yet
to
your
children
you
will
become
only
a
stationary
pointing
to
their
feet
the
way
in
which
god
intended
that
you
should
be
a
living
guide
you
have
not
done
your
duty
when
you
have
simply
permitted
the
saviour
to
come
into
your
home
as
the
guest
of
your
wife
and
the
saviour
of
your
children
he
comes
to
be
a
guest
in
your
heart
as
well
as
in
your
home
he
comes
not
only
to
save
your
wife
and
your
children
but
to
save
you
to
save
the
father
with
the
wife
and
the
children
it
is
not
enough
my
dear
brother
that
you
give
something
now
and
then
toward
the
support
of
the
church
that
you
send
your
children
to
that
you
attend
divine
service
now
and
then
your
wife
and
children
can
not
go
to
heaven
for
you
their
lonely
struggle
is
saddened
by
your
absence
and
the
thought
that
after
having
dwelt
together
with
you
upon
the
earth
you
may
be
forever
separated
from
them
in
eternity
let
me
appeal
to
you
as
an
honest
man
what
is
your
duty
in
this
matter
your
duty
to
your
wife
to
your
children
to
yourself
and
to
your
god
if
we
were
to
look
upon
this
subject
simply
in
the
light
of
temporal
good
all
the
arguments
would
be
in
favor
of
living
a
christian
life
even
if
you
were
to
consider
this
subject
on
its
very
lowest
plane
you
should
desire
for
your
wife
and
your
family
those
larger
material
blessings
which
are
secured
by
a
religious
life
christians
have
not
only
the
promise
of
the
life
that
is
to
come
but
they
have
the
promise
also
of
the
life
that
is
paul
says
godliness
is
profitable
unto
all
things
having
the
promise
of
the
life
that
now
is
and
of
that
which
is
to
come
we
grant
you
that
not
every
christian
is
encumbered
with
large
wealth
neither
is
every
irreligious
man
plunged
into
poverty
while
there
are
here
and
there
instances
where
ungodly
men
are
possessors
of
large
wealth
these
instances
are
exceptional
and
the
scriptural
reason
not
difficult
to
find
their
riches
may
be
due
to
the
fulfillment
of
the
promise
that
god
will
visit
blessings
upon
the
children
of
the
righteous
from
generation
to
generation
these
people
may
have
had
praying
and
parents
and
on
that
account
the
children
in
harmony
with
scriptural
promise
are
now
being
crowned
with
the
consequent
blessings
or
it
may
be
as
the
scripture
declares
that
the
wealth
of
the
wicked
is
being
laid
up
for
the
just
and
the
present
wicked
possessor
may
simply
be
holding
this
wealth
in
trust
for
the
righteous
descendants
who
are
to
come
after
him
or
it
may
be
that
god
is
seeking
the
salvation
of
this
ungodly
individual
for
he
tells
us
that
the
goodness
of
the
lord
is
designed
to
lead
us
to
repentance
the
actual
conditions
are
not
to
be
determined
by
taking
an
exceptional
example
among
the
irreligious
but
by
dividing
society
as
a
whole
into
two
classes
and
then
the
result
is
seen
at
a
glance
in
the
one
class
you
have
the
profane
the
vicious
the
intemperate
the
dishonest
the
and
the
defiers
of
god
and
man
to
this
class
belongs
every
man
who
staggers
reels
and
falls
into
the
gutter
every
tramp
who
walks
the
road
and
of
all
the
persons
who
fill
our
almshouses
it
includes
with
scarcely
an
exception
every
man
and
woman
who
fill
our
prisons
and
reformatory
institutions
those
who
crowd
the
great
tenements
and
live
in
filth
and
squalor
in
the
slums
of
our
cities
those
whose
bodies
reek
with
physical
and
moral
rottenness
these
and
many
others
constitute
the
class
of
the
ungodly
and
no
attentive
person
can
fail
to
observe
that
this
is
the
character
of
that
portion
which
the
ungodly
have
in
this
world
now
turn
to
the
other
class
walk
up
and
down
the
streets
where
you
find
the
most
comfortable
homes
the
largest
dwellings
the
abodes
of
the
most
affluent
and
respectable
in
any
city
and
then
answer
the
question
whether
or
no
the
wealth
of
the
nation
is
not
largely
in
the
hands
of
christian
men
and
christian
women
these
are
the
people
who
have
the
best
credit
who
can
draw
checks
for
the
largest
amounts
among
this
class
you
will
find
the
most
influential
in
business
the
owners
of
our
largest
mercantile
establishments
men
who
direct
and
control
the
commerce
of
the
world
men
who
are
at
the
head
of
our
largest
banking
institutions
railroad
and
other
corporations
but
not
only
so
these
are
the
people
who
dwell
in
the
best
homes
who
eat
the
best
food
who
have
the
largest
amount
of
material
comforts
they
are
the
people
who
enjoy
the
best
health
who
have
the
brightest
minds
who
produce
the
best
books
the
most
helpful
literature
they
have
the
brightest
eyes
and
the
strongest
bodies
and
when
cholera
and
plague
come
and
sweep
away
men
and
women
by
thousands
it
scarcely
ever
crosses
the
line
which
separates
these
from
the
intemperate
and
the
vicious
who
go
down
before
these
scourges
like
grass
before
the
sickle
truly
my
dear
friend
if
you
are
to
look
at
it
only
from
this
lowest
plane
of
present
good
and
material
comfort
godly
living
will
bring
to
you
the
promise
of
the
life
that
is
and
in
addition
you
will
also
have
the
promise
of
the
life
which
is
a
part
in
the
first
resurrection
a
place
at
christ
right
hand
and
the
promise
of
sitting
upon
a
throne
judging
the
nations
you
shall
be
among
those
who
in
triumph
enter
the
eternal
city
and
receive
crowns
and
robes
and
palms
of
victory
and
eternal
rest
at
god
right
hand
you
can
not
afford
to
neglect
the
spiritual
which
is
the
highest
and
best
of
your
threefold
nature
you
should
call
your
entire
being
into
fullest
exercise
a
christian
is
the
highest
type
of
manhood
and
you
owe
it
to
your
wife
and
to
your
children
as
well
as
to
yourself
and
to
your
master
to
be
satisfied
with
nothing
short
of
this
if
troubled
with
doubt
you

the

of
procreation
before
a
ship
sails
from
port
with
its
valuable
cargo
of
goods
and
its
priceless
freightage
of
life
they
do
what
is
called
boxing
the
compass
naturally
the
compass
would
point
to
the
true
north
but
because
of
the
character
of
the
cargo
the
needle
may
be
diverted
from
the
true
north
to
discover
whether
such
local
influences
exist
they
test
and
correct
the
compass
the
deviation
from
the
true
north
might
be
very
slight
and
in
a
very
short
voyage
the
error
might
not
result
in
serious
consequences
but
the
interests
involved
are
too
momentous
to
permit
of
any
risk
before
entering
upon
the
new
voyage
of
married
life
it
is
essential
for
the
purity
and
safety
of
the
two
who
enter
upon
it
and
also
for
the
of
the
other
lives
which
may
subsequently
be
added
to
the
family
that
the
principles
by
which
husband
and
wife
are
to
be
guided
should
be
carefully
examined
that
errors
may
be
discovered
and
corrected
for
the
wrecking
of
a
ship
is
of
less
moment
than
the
wrecking
of
human
lives
for
these
involve
not
only
temporal
but
eternal
destinies
the
false
impressions
which
young
people
oftentimes
get
is
due
to
the
general
absence
of
truthfulness
upon
the
part
of
older
and
more
experienced
persons
in
their
conversations
upon
the
subject
of
the
sexual
relation
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
questions
which
gather
about
the
subjects
of
sex
are
of
vast
moment
yet
these
subjects
have
been
so
little
written
or
spoken
about
in
a
pure
and
reverent
way
that
for
the
most
part
and
honest
people
have
banished
the
subject
from
the
round
of
ordinary
conversation
this
abandonment
of
a
sacred
subject
by
the
pure
and
truthful
has
resulted
in
the
general
ignorance
and
prevailing
errors
among
the
vile
and
impure
the
subject
is
much
talked
of
and
because
of
the
lack
of
correct
knowledge
statements
of
the
most
exaggerated
unreasonable
and
oftentimes
impossible
are
generally
accepted
as
veritable
truth
in
dealing
both
with
themselves
and
others
men
are
more
deceitful
and
untruthful
upon
this
subject
than
perhaps
upon
any
other
it
is
because
of
these
facts
that
the
young
and
inexperienced
so
often
form
the
most
exaggerated
and
unreliable
opinions
upon
subjects
relating
to
the
relation
of
the
sexes
that
we
may
the
better
understand
the
whole
question
of
the
sexual
relation
it
may
be
well
to
study
the
reproductive
life
of
plants
and
the
lower
forms
of
animal
life
the
knowledge
of
the
lessons
they
have
to
teach
may
prove
a
profitable
subject
for
thoughtful
consideration
and
lead
to
valuable
conclusions
for
guidance
in
the
relation
between
husband
and
wife
if
with
our
desire
to
start
with
one
of
the
lowest
forms
of
life
we
go
to
the
pond
and
run
our
finger
under
the
green
scum
which
floats
upon
its
surface
we
will
find
one
of
the
simplest
forms
of
vegetable
growth
known
as
spirogyra
the
innumerable
threads
of
green
are
quite
like
hairs
that
lie
side
by
side
in
close
proximity
but
not
in
contact
under
the
microscope
each
of
these
green
threads
is
composed
of
long
cells
placed
end
to
end
and
forming
a
continuous
growth
under
the
microscope
they
very
much
resemble
what
in
country
districts
is
called
bullrushes
or
the
different
sections
of
a
bamboo
or
in
the
spring
days
when
this
growth
of
green
approaches
its
maturity
it
arrives
at
that
mysterious
time
when
the
future
urgently
appeals
to
it
when
each
cell
feels
a
strange
and
irresistible
attraction
to
its
neighbor
cell
each
reaches
out
toward
the
other
until
a
contact
is
formed
a
perfect
union
is
effected
a
new
germ
is
created
and
the
old
cells
are
left
lifeless
and
perish
the
union
which
results
in
the
production
of
the
fertilized
seed
in
which
abides
the
spirogyra
of
another
springtime
while
its
beginning
costs
the
life
of
the
parent
plant
the
verdure
that
lived
in
the
green
scum
has
passed
away
the
new
germs
fall
to
the
bottom
of
the
pond
where
through
the
drought
of
summer
or
the
ice
and
cold
of
winter
they
abide
in
the
sure
resurrection
of
that
new
life
which
is
to
come
with
the
returning
springtime
in
the
higher
forms
of
life
similar
illustrations
of
the
great
parental
sacrifice
involved
in
the
act
of
reproduction
are
frequently
found
this
is
specially
seen
among
the
fishes
during
the
reproductive
weeks
life
speeds
along
with
great
intensity
under
the
flow
of
that
larger
vitality
which
greatly
quickens
and
augments
certain
parts
of
the
organism
the
fish
increase
in
size
every
part
seems
to
attain
its
perfection
and
beauty
and
the
parent
fishes
yield
themselves
to
a
reproductive
impulse
that
proves
fatal
to
millions
of
them
after
a
cod
has
expelled
its
million
or
more
of
eggs
there
is
not
much
left
of
its
own
body
there
is
diminished
vitality
in
every
part
the
male
loses
his
appetite
great
physical
changes
result
the
skin
which
covers
his
shrunken
body
changes
in
color
his
nature
becomes
irritable
and
resentful
and
he
indulges
in
fierce
combats
with
his
fellows
the
fatigue
attendant
upon
the
long
journeys
undertaken
by
the
salmon
during
the
spawning
season
and
the
exhausting
effects
of
the
fertilizing
effort
are
so
great
that
few
survive
the
trying
ordeal
the
same
results
are
practically
true
with
regard
to
the
shad
somewhat
analogous
changes
and
results
occur
with
the
female
but
they
are
less
marked
and
less
destructive
the
male
is
characterized
by
a
more
intense
activity
while
her
more
quiet
nature
is
her
greater
safeguard
the
exhaustive
and
often
fatal
effects
of
the
reproductive
act
are
very
manifest
in
insect
life
among
the
insects
the
reproductive
act
of
the
male
seems
to
round
out
the
purpose
and
complete
the
period
of
his
life
the
exhaustive
act
is
oftentimes
speedily
followed
by
death
this
same
fatal
termination
is
also
experienced
by
the
female
after
she
has
completed
the
work
of
developing
and
depositing
the
germ
in
some
place
suited
for
its
protection
and
adapted
to
its
eventual
development
and
growth
in
many
instances
the
fertilizing
principle
is
transferred
from
the
body
of
the
male
to
that
of
the
female
during
flight
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
intromittent
organ
of
the
male
and
the
ovipositor
of
the
female
develop
and
continue
only
for
that
brief
period
which
is
necessary
for
the
transference
of
the
quickening
principle
and
for
the
depositing
of
the
egg
in
a
place
of
safety
the
hive
with
its
hundreds
of
bees
affords
an
interesting
illustration
of
the
subject
in
hand
the
male
bee
is
a
drone
his
only
purpose
in
life
seems
to
be
to
await
the
period
when
the
queen
bee
in
her
instinctive
desire
to
perpetuate
the
life
of
the
swarm
is
ready
to
receive
the
from
the
male
the
drone
is
stingless
and
helpless
the
germ
of
the
queen
bee
was
developed
in
a
special
cell
was
fed
on
royal
food
and
tenderly
reared
her
office
is
not
only
to
preside
over
the
destinies
of
the
swarm
but
to
her
alone
is
assigned
the
entire
work
of
reproduction
she
never
leaves
the
hive
but
once
and
then
upon
her
nuptial
flight
accompanied
by
a
male
bee
when
the
wedding
journey
is
over
and
the
queen
bee
has
received
the

his
work
is
done
and
his
destiny
is
sealed
death
then
ensues
either
by
natural
laws
or
he
is
stung
to
death
by
the
workers
who
now
regard
him
as
an
unnecessary
burden
upon
the
gathered
stores
of
the
hive
the
queen
bee
receives
the
sperm
but
once
and
then
in
a
mysterious
receptacle
which
providence
has
provided
the
sperm
is
stored
and
for
months
and
even
for
years
for
the
supply
has
been
known
to
last
for
five
years
and
during
this
time
the
millions
of
eggs
which
the
queen
bee
lays
are
each
fertilized
at
will
and
strange
to
say
her
wonderful
prolificness
does
not
result
in
her
exhaustion
and
death
and
to
prevent
this
sad
result
her
make
it
their
care
that
she
shall
be
bountifully
nourished
with
the
most
sumptuous
food
with
the
birds
death
as
the
result
of
the
reproductive
act
disappears
the
loss
which
they
sustain
in
reproductive
material
is
comparatively
small
yet
something
of
what
this
costs
is
manifest
by
the
noticeable
changes
which
take
place
immediately
after
they
enter
upon
the
mating
season
the
plumage
loses
its
lustre
the
song
becomes
less
frequent
and
less
ecstatic
and
the
incoming
tides
of
life
which
reached
their
fullness
at
the
period
of
mating
ebb
and
recede
among
the
higher
forms
of
animal
existence
the
duration
of
life
is
greatly
prolonged
the
number
of
the
offspring
is
greatly
reduced
the
ovum
of
the
female
and
the
sperm
of
the
male
become
microscopic
the
germ
of
life
remains
within
the
body
of
the
mother
until
it
has
reached
that
stage
of
development
which
fits
it
for
its
independent
life
in
the
outer
world
the
period
from
conception
to
birth
is
greatly
prolonged
and
the
periods
of
deliverance
from
the
necessity
of
the
reproductive
act
are
alike
extended
the
higher
in
the
scale
the
more
dependent
the
offspring
until
in
the
instance
of
man
the
offspring
is
the
most
helpless
and
dependent
of
all
the
prolonged
dependence
of
the
child
upon
the
care
of
its
parents
is
calculated
to
abate
the
fervor
and
force
of
reproductive
inclination
while
in
man
the
reproductive
act
is
not
the
precursor
of
death
yet
it
is
the
premonition
of
that
event
and
the
instinctive
effort
which
nature
makes
to
prevent
the
extermination
of
the
race
the
inclination
to
beget
descendants
is
a
premonition
of
the
physical
dissolution
which
awaits
the
individual
and
the
act
itself
is
always
more
or
less
exhaustive
to
the
male
and
its
results
if
too
oft
repeated
or
at
periods
of
brief
duration
are
disastrous
to
the
female
notwithstanding
these
tendencies
and
results
yet
reproduction
is
the
expression
of
the
fullness
of
physical
life
and
vital
force
its
inclination
and
desire
is
both
normal
and
necessary
yet
it
should
always
be
remembered
that
the
increased
activity
of
the
reproductive
system
is
secured
at
the
cost
of
diminished
force
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
entire
body
no
man
during
the
period
of
the
exercise
of
his
reproductive
nature
is
as
strong
intellectually
physically
or
in
any
other
department
of
his
entire
being
as
during
the
periods
when
he
is
sexually
or
is
resting
in
the
calm
of
sexual
repose
in
the
lower
forms
of
life
the
reproductive
flame
bursts
out
into
one
conflagration
exhausting
to
the
male
and
eventually
terminating
with
fatal
results
to
the
female
in
man
this
fire
burns
with
a
more
steady
glow
bursting
forth
occasionally
into
more
intense
activity
and
then
subsiding
but
always
vitalizing
and
giving
energy
to
all
his
powers
and
no
man
can
fan
this
flame
into
a
continuous
conflagration
without
suffering
the
most
ruinous
results
and
disastrous
consequences
among
the
lower
forms
of
life
the
reproductive
inclination
of
the
male
recurs
at
those
periods
when
his
mate
is
in
the
condition
necessary
to
the
procreation
of
the
species
after
the
act
of
procreation
the
sexual
passion
in
both
subsides
and
the
reproductive
function
is
not
again
called
into
exercise
until
after
the
intervening
weeks
or
months
of
repose
have
passed
and
nature
again
responds
to
the
necessity
of
procreation
for
the
purpose
of
perpetuating
the
species
where
the
periods
of
ovulation
and
fecundity
recur
at
brief
intervals
in
the
female
the
reproductive
nature
of
the
male
is
in
a
more
continuous
state
of
activity
so
that
a
fruitful
union
may
be
secured
when
the
reproductive
nature
of
the
female
is
in
readiness
but
this
by
no
means
indicates
any
physical
necessity
or
reasonable
justification
for
the
constant
or
even
frequent
exercise
of
the
reproductive
function
strict
continence
is
not
injurious
either
to
the
unmarried
or
to
the
married
thousands
of
married
men
and
women
are
suffering
from
the
effects
of
excessive
sexual
indulgence
they
drain
their
physical
powers
weaken
the
intellect
and
fail
to
attain
the
happiness
and
grand
results
which
would
otherwise
be
possible
to
them
all
who
are
familiar
with
the
care
of
plants
know
that
the
best
way
to
preserve
their
bloom
and
beauty
is
to
restrain
the
consummation
of
the
reproductive
act
prevent
them
from
going
to
seed
and
the
flowers
continue
to
bloom
remove
the
anther
from
the
lily
and
the
flower
will
not
fade
so
soon
by
several
hours
the
same
is
true
with
the
insects
where
they
can
be
prevented
from
losing
their
vitalizing
sperm
they
live
on
beyond
the
limits
of
others
of
their
kind
who
are
left
free
to
exercise
the
privilege
of
reproduction
an
instance
is
given
of
a
butterfly
which
continued
to
live
for
over
two
years
in
a
while
the
ordinary
period
of
life
to
those
which
exercise
the
reproductive
power
complete
and
end
their
career
in
a
few
short
days
there
are
times
when
married
people
should
observe
the
strictest
continence
a
state
of
partial
or
total
intoxication
is
a
just
cause
for
either
a
husband
or
wife
to
deny
to
the
other
all
marital
privileges
conception
at
such
a
time
is
more
than
likely
to
result
in
the
production
of
idiots
or
epileptics
the
cases
on
record
are
too
numerous
and
too
well
authenticated
to
admit
of
doubt
in
regard
to
the
terrible
consequences
of
conception
under
such
circumstances
during
sickness
or
convalescence
procreation
is
not
only
highly
injurious
to
the
individual
but
at
any
period
before
the
physical
powers
have
fully
regained
their
most
perfect
state
of
health
the
transmission
of
life
is
more
than
likely
to
result
in
the
begetting
of
children
who
are
to
be
afflicted
with
mental
debility
and
physical
infirmities
which
shall
be
so
inwrought
into
the
very
fibre
of
their
being
as
to
continue
through
their
entire
life
utterly
beyond
the
reach
of
all
remedial
agents
we
can
conceive
of
no
greater
wrong
that
a
parent
could
ignorantly
or
wilfully
inflict
upon
his
unborn
offspring
than
to
call
them
into
being
at
a
period
when
they
can
not
escape
the
inheritance
of
lifelong
physical
or
mental
infirmity
abstinence
from
the
marital
relation
in
some
instances
becomes
almost
absolutely
imperative
in
the
intimate
relations
of
married
life
the
exercise
of
such
is
not
always
easy
but
it
is
nevertheless
possible
there
are
instances
in
the
lives
of
missionaries
who
have
married
and
immediately
gone
to
climates
where
conception
during
the
period
of
acclimation
would
have
resulted
fatally
who
have
maintained
absolute
continence
for
a
period
of
months
and
years
we
know
of
an
instance
where
because
of
a
diseased
condition
known
as
vaginismus
the
marital
relation
was
attended
with
such
discomfort
and
pain
that
for
a
few
years
it
was
only
indulged
at
long
intervals
and
then
totally
abandoned
and
strict
continence
maintained
for
a
period
of
twenty
years
and
more
nor
is
strict
continence
in
married
life
without
illustrations
of
those
who
have
voluntarily
chosen
it
there
are
some
married
people
in
this
country
more
numerous
than
some
suppose
who
have
adopted
the
idea
of
uniform
continence
and
who
call
the
reproductive
nature
into
exercise
for
the
purpose
of
procreation
only
and
who
assert
that
the
maintenance
of
continence
secures
not
only
greater
strength
and
better
health
but
greater
happiness
also
chapter
vi
marital
moderation
the
foundation
of
marriage
and
of
home
can
only
be
built
permanently
upon
the
abiding
nature
of
love
like
our
own
being
love
has
a
twofold
nature
its
spiritual
part
is
immortal
and
unchangeable
its
physical
part
is
temporary
in
purpose
and
continuance
and
is
liable
to
perversion
and
debasement
the
physical
may
even
be
permitted
to
overshadow
debase
and
quite
obliterate
the
spiritual
in
its
natural
unfolding
and
manifestation
love
is
very
much
like
the
plant
that
is
rooted
in
the
earth
while
it
flowers
in
the
sunlight
the
earth
and
the
roots
in
their
relation
to
each
other
are
essential
and
even
indispensable
to
the
production
of
the
flower
and
the
flower
is
alike
indispensable
to
the
perpetuity
of
the
plant
so
love
has
its
physical
and
its
spiritual
nature
love
is
rooted
in
that
unconscious
law
of
our
nature
which
god
has
enacted
for
the
preservation
and
perpetuity
of
human
life
nothing
but
a
spurious
delicacy
or
an
ignorance
of
facts
can
prevent
our
full
recognition
that
love
looks
to
marriage
and
marriage
to
offspring
as
a
natural
sequence
while
this
is
its
objective
purpose
it
yet
serves
other
high
ends
in
its
twofold
nature
love
ennobles
its
possessor
it
makes
him
responsive
to
the
love
of
god
upon
the
one
hand
and
to
the
love
of
mankind
upon
the
other
it
gives
purpose
and
zest
to
life
brightens
the
intellect
quickens
the
imagination
inspires
purpose
and
imparts
physical
power
it
beautifies
and
glorifies
the
individual
and
makes
him
worthy
of
redemption
when
it
is
pure
and
true
it
unites
two
souls
in
bonds
of
happiness
which
never
chafe
and
which
become
stronger
as
time
passes
and
the
passions
become
chaste
and
subdued
but
there
is
a
monstrosity
that
is
known
by
the
same
name
the
proper
name
of
this
monster
is
lust
it
imparts
neither
beauty
nor
life
it
is
like
the
parasite
plant
which
is
not
naturally
rooted
in
the
earth
but
entwines
itself
about
the
growing
beauty
of
other
only
to
suck
out
the
from
the
stem
which
has
lifted
it
out
of
the
dirt
into
the
sunlight
in
return
for
which
its
only
charity
is
that
it
spreads
its
stolen
verdure
over
the
death
which
it
has
itself
created
the
question
of
the
proper
relation
of
husband
and
wife
in
marriage
is
a
difficult
one
it
is
worthy
of
a
volume
the
various
phases
of
the
subject
which
crowd
upon
our
mind
exceed
the
limits
of
a
brief
chapter
we
only
regret
that
we
are
restricted
by
limitations
beyond
which
we
can
not
pass
at
this
present
time
suffice
it
to
say
that
there
are
three
principal
theories
with
regard
to
the
marital
relation
briefly
stated
they
are
as
follows
the
first
theory
assumes
that
unlimited
sexual
gratification
is
essential
to
the
comfort
and
of
the
male
and
that
whether
married
or
unmarried
he
is
to
seek
its
gratification
whether
lawfully
or
unlawfully
wherever
and
whenever
he
can
find
an
opportunity
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
this
theory
is
not
worthy
of
the
consideration
of
and
decent
people
it
is
contrary
to
the
laws
of
nature
to
the
laws
of
god
and
to
the
laws
of
all
civilized
nations
the
theory
is
conceived
and
born
of
lust
it
has
been
fathered
and
fostered
by
the
delusions
of
ignorant
people
it
is
the
child
of
lust
and
the
parent
of
sensuality
it
is
disproven
by
experience
and
is
condemned
by
the
best
medical
authority
in
this
country
and
throughout
the
world
for
a
discussion
of
this
subject
and
medical
testimony
we
must
refer
the
reader
to
what
a
young
man
ought
to
know
from
page
to
the
second
theory
is
that
in
married
life
the
reproductive
function
is
not
to
be
exercised
except
for
the
purpose
of
procreation
while
this
theory
is
the
opposite
extreme
of
the
first
yet
it
differs
from
the
first
in
that
it
has
some
very
strong
arguments
in
its
favor
while
the
results
of
our
investigations
do
not
enable
us
to
assert
that
it
is
the
true
theory
we
are
yet
prepared
to
say
that
it
is
worthy
of
thoughtful
consideration
if
it
is
possible
for
married
people
to
maintain
absolute
continence
for
a
period
of
six
months
or
a
year
it
must
be
conceded
that
it
would
be
possible
to
extend
that
time
to
a
longer
period
the
maintenance
of
this
theory
would
require
such
a
degree
of
and
as
is
far
beyond
the
possession
of
the
great
mass
of
humanity
we
fear
also
that
there
are
but
few
even
if
they
entered
upon
a
life
union
with
such
thought
and
intention
who
would
be
able
to
maintain
their
principles
for
any
considerable
period
the
third
theory
and
that
which
many
men
and
women
who
are
eminent
for
their
learning
and
religious
life
hold
to
be
the
correct
theory
is
that
while
no
one
has
a
right
to
enter
upon
the
marriage
relation
with
the
fixed
purpose
of
evading
the
duty
of
parenthood
yet
that
procreation
is
not
the
only
high
and
holy
purpose
which
god
has
had
in
view
in
establishing
the
marriage
relation
but
that
the
act
of
sexual
congress
may
be
indulged
in
between
husband
and
wife
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
their
mutual
affection
augmenting
their
personal
endearments
and
for
quickening
those
affections
and
tender
feelings
which
are
calculated
to
render
home
the
place
of
blessing
and
good
which
god
intended
it
is
held
by
those
who
advocate
this
theory
that
while
it
would
be
possible
to
restrict
the
exercise
of
the
reproductive
functions
to
the
single
purpose
of
procreation
yet
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
the
effort
to
live
by
that
theory
would
generally
result
in
marital
unhappiness
it
can
not
be
successfully
denied
that
the
perpetuity
of
the
race
is
the
great
purpose
which
god
has
had
in
view
in
instituting
marriage
procreation
and
the
raising
up
of
a
family
of
children
can
not
under
ordinary
circumstances
be
ignored
or
evaded
without
serious
physical
intellectual
moral
and
social
results
but
neither
are
mutual
love
affection
comfort
consolation
and
support
to
be
ignored
without
disastrous
results
due
regard
is
not
only
to
be
paid
to
the
perpetuity
of
the
race
but
to
the
and
perpetuity
of
the
individual
in
his
book
on
the
ethics
of
marriage
pomeroy
says
physiologically
considered
there
can
be
but
one
end
in
marriage
the
breeding
and
rearing
of
a
family
but
there
are
various
means
which
conduce
to
this
end
by
preserving
the
mental
and
physical
tone
and
balance
of
husband
and
wife
and
cultivating
in
them
a
union
of
regard
and
affection
without
which
any
mere
outward
union
can
be
but
a
travesty
of
marriage
how
far
it
may
be
proper
to
exercise
the
secondary
object
of
marriage
it
is
impossible
to
state
in
any
general
rule
because
individual
cases
vary
so
greatly
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
phase
of
marriage
which
is
so
closely
allied
to
its
primary
object
has
an
important
bearing
on
the
health
happiness
and
harmony
of
husband
and
wife
and
so
may
properly
be
exercised
by
those
who
have
a
proper
regard
for
the
primary
end
of
marriage
even
when
its
relation
to
this
end
be
but
indirect
provided
such
exercise
of
it
be
kept
within
bounds
of
mental
and
physical
health
personally
we
are
strongly
inclined
to
the
acceptance
of
this
third
theory
but
it
must
be
granted
that
the
acceptance
of
this
theory
is
attended
with
many
considerations
which
have
their
serious
perplexities
perhaps
the
most
constant
and
most
serious
difficulty
is
the
question
involved
in
the
danger
of
too
frequent
conception
to
regulate
this
matter
many
persons
resort
to
criminal
methods
which
are
nothing
short
of
murder
many
resort
to
expedients
which
are
often
unsatisfactory
in
their
result
and
also
ruinous
to
the
health
or
of
either
the
husband
or
wife
or
both
while
others
adopt
less
disastrous
but
equally
unsatisfactory
and
unreliable
measures
some
of
these
methods
are
criminal
others
are
injurious
still
others
uncertain
and
all
alike
unsatisfactory
desirable
as
it
might
be
to
enter
upon
a
full
discussion
of
the
various
questions
involved
in
the
consideration
of
this
phase
of
the
subject
yet
because
of
the
general
prevalence
of
vicious
living
and
impure
thinking
we
deem
it
best
not
to
enter
upon
a
discussion
which
might
effect
more
evil
in
some
persons
by
suggestion
than
it
could
accomplish
in
the
reforming
of
the
evil
practices
of
the
vicious
and
we
therefore
pass
this
phase
of
the
subject
in
silence
the
greatest
happiness
in
married
life
can
never
be
obtained
except
by
the
observance
of
marital
moderation
just
what
is
moderation
in
the
exercise
of
the
reproductive
function
in
married
life
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
determine
and
define
what
might
be
moderation
for
one
man
or
for
one
woman
might
be
the
most
extravagant
excess
for
another
the
husband
may
feel
inclined
to
grant
himself
such
indulgence
as
would
entitle
him
to
be
regarded
as
considerate
and
as
within
the
bounds
of
moderation
when
considered
in
relation
to
himself
personally
and
yet
the
privileges
which
he
grants
himself
might
be
most
immoderate
and
most
ruinous
for
his
wife
or
in
some
instances
the
reverse
might
be
the
case
indulgence
which
might
be
moderate
for
his
wife
might
be
most
excessive
for
him
no
husband
or
wife
can
determine
what
is
moderation
in
their
own
personal
instance
until
they
have
duly
considered
the
obligation
which
they
are
under
to
the
other
and
the
effect
of
the
relation
not
simply
upon
himself
or
herself
but
upon
the
other
as
well
the
principle
which
must
govern
every
husband
or
wife
who
desires
to
be
moderate
in
the
marital
relation
is
not
to
seek
to
grant
themselves
the
utmost
indulgence
which
will
enable
them
to
abide
within
the
limits
of
individual
safety
only
but
so
persistently
to
exercise
the
spirit
of
and
that
they
may
attain
to
those
best
results
which
are
only
possible
to
those
who
do
not
call
the
reproductive
function
into
exercise
at
too
frequent
intervals
no
man
or
woman
who
exercises
the
reproductive
function
upon
the
return
of
every
slight
inclination
can
realize
that
greatest
pleasure
and
satisfaction
which
are
always
possible
but
so
seldom
experienced
the
wise
husband
and
the
wise
wife
will
not
seek
that
utmost
indulgence
which
brings
them
to
the
limit
of
endurance
but
will
constantly
desire
to
be
governed
by
such
restraint
and
moderation
as
will
secure
for
them
the
most
blessed
results
to
say
nothing
of
morality
intelligence
and
culture
have
their
province
in
the
exercise
of
the
privileges
which
are
possible
to
married
people
the
reproductive
sense
like
the
sense
of
hunger
or
any
other
sense
is
to
be
brought
under
the
dominion
of
intelligence
and
refinement
in
the
government
of
our
other
senses
there
are
laws
which
no
intelligent
man
will
be
willing
to
violate
he
will
not
eat
the
first
food
upon
which
he
chances
to
come
simply
because
he
is
hungry
he
requires
that
it
shall
be
of
the
proper
kind
and
properly
prepared
the
worm
will
seize
upon
its
food
regardless
of
its
character
and
without
any
reference
to
other
considerations
than
that
of
satisfying
its
own
inclination
wild
beasts
will
contend
over
a
bone
but
man
is
lifted
by
intelligence
to
a
higher
realm
his
food
must
be
of
a
proper
kind
it
must
be
properly
prepared
and
is
to
be
eaten
at
appointed
intervals
he
will
not
eat
that
which
belongs
to
another
he
desires
his
food
served
with
proper
regard
to
cleanliness
and
esthetic
taste
he
beautifies
his
table
makes
his
eating
the
occasion
of
social
fellowship
takes
into
consideration
the
wants
and
needs
of
others
if
we
thus
regulate
the
appetite
why
should
we
not
as
intelligent
beings
regulate
the
exercise
of
the
reproductive
sense
why
should
we
yield
like
animals
to
the
first
inclination
why
should
we
despoil
ourselves
or
our
companion
of
the
sense
of
modesty
why
should
we
be
willing
to
indulge
ourselves
to
such
an
extent
as
to
injure
the
one
individual
whom
we
love
and
prize
above
all
others
upon
earth
let
reason
refinement
and
the
moral
sense
have
their
proper
sway
in
the
exercise
of
the
reproductive
function
and
the
sexual
instinct
the
same
as
in
the
exercise
of
our
other
senses
in
a
chapter
entitled
rules
for
married
persons
or
matrimonial
chastity
jeremy
taylor
gives
the
following
advice
in
their
permissions
and
license
the
husband
and
wife
must
be
sure
to
observe
the
order
of
nature
and
the
ends
of
god
he
is
an
ill
husband
that
uses
his
wife
as
a
man
treats
a
harlot
having
no
other
end
but
pleasure
concerning
which
our
best
rule
is
that
although
in
this
as
in
eating
and
drinking
there
is
an
appetite
to
be
satisfied
which
can
not
be
done
without
pleasing
that
desire
yet
since
that
desire
and
satisfaction
were
intended
by
nature
for
other
ends
they
should
never
be
separated
from
those
ends
but
always
be
joined
with
all
or
one
of
these
ends
with
the
desire
for
children
to
avoid
fornication
or
to
lighten
and
ease
the
cares
and
sadness
of
household
affairs
or
to
endear
each
other
but
never
with
a
purpose
either
in
act
or
desire
to
separate
the
sensuality
from
these
ends
which
hallow
it
it
is
well
also
to
know
what
the
women
have
to
say
upon
this
subject
duffey
in
her
excellent
little
book
entitled
what
women
should
know
says
one
is
often
led
to
wonder
if
a
large
class
of
men
are
not
simply
brutes
in
all
that
concerns
the
physical
relations
of
marriage
women
do
not
readily
make
confidential
complaints
to
other
women
against
their
husbands
so
that
when
a
word
an
incomplete
sentence
smothered
before
it
is
fully
uttered
is
spoken
it
must
be
wrung
from
the
lips
by
extreme
marital
brutality
that
many
women
so
suffer
at
the
hands
of
husbands
brutal
in
this
respect
though
kind
in
all
others
does
not
admit
of
doubt
disinclination
weariness
ill
health
none
of
these
things
will
excuse
a
woman
from
participation
in
the
marital
act
when
her
husband
inclinations
lead
him
to
require
it
of
her
strange
that
while
the
law
recognizes
rape
as
a
crime
punishable
by
severe
penalties
there
is
no
recognition
whatever
of
a
married
woman
right
to
a
control
over
her
own
person
i
do
not
know
that
the
most
brutal
conduct
in
this
respect
if
there
was
no
other
reason
for
complaint
would
be
considered
by
the
courts
as
a
sufficient
cause
for
divorce
yet
any
one
can
readily
imagine
that
it
is
possible
for
a
man
of
strong
sensual
nature
who
places
no
curb
upon
his
appetite
to
render
the
life
of
the
delicate
woman
intolerable
to
the
last
degree
as
mutual
affection
is
the
heavenly
bond
of
marriage
so
mutual
pleasure
should
also
sanction
its
earthly
bond
love
should
be
prepared
to
give
as
well
as
to
receive
to
be
when
is
required
of
it
i
can
not
believe
that
a
wife
who
sees
her
husband
thus
considerate
will
be
unreasonable
in
her
refusal
but
the
anxious
and
honest
inquirer
still
asks
how
often
may
i
indulge
myself
no
general
answer
can
be
given
to
this
question
due
reference
must
always
be
had
to
the
individual
who
asks
it
and
wise
counsel
would
not
be
possible
unless
every
consideration
of
the
physical
condition
and
health
of
the
wife
were
allowed
their
proper
place
in
the
solution
of
the
question
what
might
be
moderation
for
one
might
be
the
most
destructive
excess
for
another
some
men
are
strong
have
great
powers
of
endurance
and
do
not
know
that
they
have
a
nerve
in
their
body
others
are
very
delicate
nervous
and
dyspeptic
some
physicians
are
inclined
to
limit
the
relation
to
once
a
month
upon
the
other
hand
all
who
have
given
attention
to
this
subject
have
learned
of
instances
of
excess
which
do
not
fall
at
all
short
of
conjugal
debauchery
it
might
be
said
that
no
man
of
average
health
physical
power
and
intellectual
acumen
can
exceed
the
bounds
of
once
a
week
without
at
least
being
in
danger
of
having
entered
upon
a
life
of
excess
both
for
himself
and
for
his
wife
each
young
husband
must
determine
for
himself
and
his
wife
when
they
have
reached
the
limit
of
moderation
and
their
greatest
happiness
physically
intellectually
and
maritally
will
be
secured
when
they
have
erred
upon
the
side
of
moderation
rather
than
upon
the
side
of
excess
do
not
wait
until
you
have
the
pronounced
effects
of
backache
lassitude
giddiness
dimness
of
sight
noises
in
the
ears
numbness
of
fingers
and
paralysis
note
your
own
condition
the
next
day
very
carefully
if
you
observe
a
lack
of
normal
physical
power
a
loss
of
intellectual
quickness
or
mental
grip
if
you
are
sensitive
and
irritable
if
you
are
less
kind
and
considerate
of
your
wife
if
you
are
morose
and
less
companionable
or
in
any
way
fall
below
your
best
standard
of
excellence
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
think
seriously
and
proceed
cautiously
nor
should
your
observation
and
study
only
have
reference
to
yourself
note
carefully
the
physical
mental
and
social
condition
of
your
wife
the
day
following
you
are
not
only
to
be
the
conservator
of
your
own
strength
but
her
protector
as
well
when
you
pass
the
limit
of
the
greatest
safety
either
for
yourself
or
your
wife
you
are
likely
to
sacrifice
both
safety
and
happiness
another
says
even
taking
the
low
and
sordid
ground
of
selfishly
getting
the
most
out
of
this
life
it
is
wise
to
abide
by
temperance
and
duty
in
the
marital
relation
for
thus
and
only
thus
may
we
derive
the
most
possible
satisfaction
from
it
we
may
drink
the
nectar
as
we
will
nature
lets
us
hold
the
cup
but
she
mixes
it
herself
if
we
drink
too
deeply
she
adds
water
then
gall
and
finally
it
may
be
deadly
poison
sexual
excess
is
one
of
the
most
destructive
forms
of
intemperance
degrading
alike
the
body
mind
and
morals
we
have
heard
of
men
who
have
called
the
reproductive
organs
into
very
frequent
exercise
but
they
have
always
been
men
who
were
noted
for
nothing
except
their
passion
everything
they
eat
and
drink
seems
devoted
to
the
maintenance
of
their
sexual
nature
they
may
have
enjoyed
intellectual
advantages
and
some
of
them
may
even
be
enrolled
as
professional
men
but
every
other
faculty
is
dwarfed
and
weakened
that
they
may
foster
and
fatten
their
passions
they
are
eminent
in
nothing
save
as
samples
of
beastliness
why
allow
a
single
passion
the
controlling
organ
of
which
lies
at
the
very
bottom
and
lowest
part
of
the
brain
to
usurp
and
control
the
entire
man
dominate
over
every
other
faculty
and
render
the
physical
intellectual
and
moral
faculties
and
religious
sentiments
only
attendants
and
slaves
no
thoughtful
or
considerate
husband
can
afford
to
disrespect
the
wishes
of
his
wife
he
should
reverently
consider
her
inclination
as
well
as
his
own
desire
throughout
the
entire
range
of
animal
life
the
condition
and
inclination
of
the
female
fixes
and
determines
the
approaches
of
her
mate
woman
is
the
only
female
whose
condition
is
disregarded
whose
wishes
are
ignored
whose
rights
are
trampled
under
foot
and
sometimes
even
denied
any
right
over
her
own
body
where
a
woman
is
in
health
and
is
the
loving
devoted
wife
which
she
should
be
there
is
not
much
danger
that
she
will
be
too
strict
with
the
idol
of
her
heart
and
save
in
exceptional
cases
there
is
but
little
danger
that
the
wife
will
be
too
lenient
with
her
husband
if
the
wrongs
which
wives
suffer
because
of
the
unbridled
passions
of
inconsiderate
husbands
were
publicly
known
every
virtuous
and
man
and
woman
would
be
inclined
to
take
up
arms
for
the
mitigation
of
woman
wrongs
and
the
liberation
of
this
great
army
of
slaves
who
suffer
in
silence
the
servitude
from
which
they
have
no
hope
of
deliverance
except
by
death
if
you
wish
to
attain
your
greatest
usefulness
in
life
avoid
the
undue
use
of
foods
which
are
calculated
to
stimulate
the
reproductive
nature
use
eggs
and
oysters
pepper
and
condiments
with
reasonable
moderation
do
not
simulate
impure
thinking
by
the
reading
of
salacious
books
participation
in
the
round
dance
the
presence
of
nude
statuary
and
suggestive
pictures
avoid
such
bodily
exposure
and
postures
as
mar
the
modesty
of
both
man
and
woman
keep
reasonable
and
regular
hours
and
remember
that
all
these
things
tend
only
to
enervate
and
exhaust
your
wife
and
to
rob
and
wrong
you
of
the
best
there
is
in
store
for
you
marital
moderation
is
most
easily
secured
and
maintained
where
married
persons
occupy
separate
beds
and
indeed
in
many
instances
such
conditions
exist
as
render
separate
rooms
not
only
desirable
but
essential
duffey
a
good
and
reliable
authority
on
this
and
related
subjects
says
if
the
husband
can
not
properly
control
his
amorous
propensities
they
had
better
by
all
means
occupy
separate
beds
and
different
apartments
with
a
lock
on
the
communicating
door
the
key
in
the
wife
possession
dio
lewis
in
his
book
entitled
chastity
when
writing
of
the
excesses
which
lead
to
estrangement
in
married
life
says
a
very
large
part
of
this
wretchedness
and
perilous
excess
is
the
natural
result
of
our
system
of
sleeping
in
the
same
bed
it
is
the
most
ingenious
of
all
possible
devices
to
stimulate
and
inflame
the
carnal
passion
no
bed
is
large
enough
for
two
persons
if
brides
only
knew
the
great
risk
they
run
of
losing
the
most
precious
of
all
earthly
possessions
the
love
of
their
husbands
they
would
struggle
as
resolutely
to
secure
extreme
temperance
after
marriage
as
they
do
to
maintain
complete
abstinence
before
the
ceremony
the
best
means
to
this
end
is
the
separate
bed
many
persons
recognize
the
injurious
effects
which
result
from
two
persons
sleeping
in
the
same
bed
but
generally
they
fear
that
if
they
were
to
occupy
adjoining
apartments
or
even
separate
beds
in
the
same
room
it
might
lead
to
local
gossip
or
the
suspicion
of
a
lack
of
harmony
or
affection
but
without
informing
the
patient
of
the
purpose
physicians
oftentimes
advise
a
period
of
absence
either
for
the
husband
or
for
the
wife
in
order
to
secure
the
beneficial
result
which
could
be
had
in
their
own
homes
if
they
would
only
consent
to
sleep
apart
where
either
the
husband
or
the
wife
suffers
from
excessive
amative
propensities
upon
the
part
of
the
other
great
benefit
would
be
derived
from
avoiding
the
sexual
excitement
which
comes
daily
by
the
exposure
of
undressing
and
dressing
in
each
presence
and
being
in
close
bodily
contact
for
a
period
of
of
the
hours
of
each
day
for
four
months
in
a
year
and
for
twenty
years
to
those
who
have
lived
together
for
a
period
of
sixty
years
there
are
also
the
questions
of
adequate
ventilation
the
absorption
of
the
exhalations
of
each
other
bodies
the
weaker
being
injured
by
the
fact
that
the
stronger
is
likely
to
absorb
vital
and
nervous
force
and
also
the
equalization
of
magnetic
elements
which
when
diverse
in
quantity
and
quality
augment
physical
attraction
and
personal
affection
where
there
is
a
disparity
of
physical
condition
or
a
considerable
difference
of
age
or
either
person
is
suffering
from
the
effects
of
any
disease
which
contaminates
the
atmosphere
separate
beds
and
oftentimes
separate
apartments
are
essential
physical
culture
is
an
important
matter
for
consideration
in
connection
with
the
subject
of
moderation
within
the
marriage
relation
all
forms
of
outdoor
recreation
which
are
calculated
to
produce
the
best
physical
condition
exercises
of
various
kinds
frequent
bathing
followed
by
vigorous
rubbing
of
the
external
surface
of
the
body
are
matters
of
great
importance
in
this
connection
if
the
thought
is
permitted
to
centre
upon
the
sexual
relation
the
blood
will
be
diverted
from
the
brain
and
the
muscles
and
the
entire
man
will
suffer
because
of
the
depletion
and
drain
which
comes
as
an
inevitable
result
let
the
thought
be
turned
to
other
considerations
and
by
exercise
send
the
blood
into
all
parts
of
the
body
and
let
the
vigorous
rubbing
after
the
bath
produce
a
healthy

but
it
is
equally
important
for
the

who
is
even
more
likely
to
underestimate
its
value
and
neglect
it
altogether
unless
she
is
encouraged
to

remember
that
you
and
your

owe

owe
it
also
to
your

a

the

is

the

gains

defects
and
deficiencies
the
approach
to
new
relations
and
untried
conditions
often
awakens
in
the
minds
of
the
unmarried
apprehensions
which
are
entitled
at
least
to
a
brief
consideration
at
this
place
many
young
men
who
are
looking
forward
to
marriage
spend
months
of
anxious
forethought
lest
there
should
exist
in
them
some
physical
incapacity
which
might
unfit
them
for
the
new
relation
into
which
they
are
about
to
enter
such
fears
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
are
wholly
groundless
and
in
the
exceptional
instances
the
insufficiency
is
generally
more
seeming
than
real
where
the
previous
life
has
been
correct
and
virtuous
there
is
not
more
than
one
case
in
a
thousand
where
any
serious
embarrassment
may
reasonably
be
expected
to
arise
because
of
a
lack
of
nourishing
food
the
neglect
of
exercise
and
physical
culture
excessive
overwork
dissipation
and
late
hours
many
young
men
suffer
from
sexual
weakness
and
become
apprehensive
of
impotence
and
when
they
contemplate
marriage
resort
to
stimulants
or
the
most
foolish
expedients
for
regaining
or
testing
their
sexual
power
no
more
foolish
or
destructive
course
could
be
pursued
the
right
thing
to
do
is
to
inquire
into
the
influences
which
have
produced
the
debility
remove
the
cause
resort
to
such
indoor
and
exercises
as
will
tend
to
the
best
development
of
the
physical
man
restore
health
increase
the
ordinary
powers
of
endurance
and
then
the
apprehensions
will
all
disappear
physical
weakness
and
general
debility
when
emphasized
by
the
nervous
strain
of
the
ordinary
marriage
occasion
and
followed
by
the
excitement
inseparable
from
the
earliest
marital
relation
often
result
in
premature
sexual
loss
and
temporary
departure
of
erectile
power
and
beget
apprehension
and
even
awaken
fear
but
even
where
such
instances
do
occur
they
are
usually
only
temporary
actual
impotence
during
a
period
of
manhood
is
very
rare
where
there
is
ground
for
just
apprehension
the
young
man
should
always
consult
an
intelligent
and
conscientious
physician
if
he
suggests
either
stimulants
or
association
with
dissolute
women
in
order
to
test
your
powers
in
order
to
strengthen
the
reproductive
system
accept
this
as
a
sufficient
evidence
of
his
incompetency
and
immorality
as
well
and
betake
yourself
to
another
physician
the
world
has
passed
on
to
that
period
when
a
practitioner
who
is
so
ignorant
as
to
give
such
dangerous
and
destructive
advice
is
unworthy
of
the
confidence
of
the
people
upon
whose
credulity
and
purses
he
preys
and
also
of
the
respect
of
decent
people
or
a
place
among
intelligent
physicians
any
young
man
who
has
several
months
remaining
before
marriage
can
easily
remove
all
groundless
apprehensions
by
such
a
full
observance
of
the
laws
of
health
due
exercise
in
the
open
air
the
use
of
and
home
exercisers
as
will
develop
his
physical
powers
and
enable
him
to
come
to
a
just
apprehension
of
his
real
condition
nor
need
a
young
man
who
has
selected
a
bride
in
good
health
and
in
appropriate
physical
proportions
to
himself
feel
any
anxieties
concerning
the
deficiencies
or
deformities
in
her
medical
authorities
affirm
that
the
obstacles
to
the
consummation
of
marriage
are
far
less
frequent
in
females
than
in
males
the
greatest
barriers
to
a
proper
entrance
upon
marriage
upon
the
part
of
men
are
found
in
excessive
solitary
and
social
vice
and
especially
in
the
results
which
attend
and
follow
venereal
diseases
all
of
which
exert
a
debilitating
effect
upon
the
masculine
function
where
a
young
husband
will
carefully
observe
the
suggestions
made
in
a
later
chapter
concerning
the
treatment
of
his
bride
especially
from
the
first
day
they
are
married
he
will
successfully
pass
any
dangers
none
of
which
are
likely
to
appear
in
the
subsequent
weeks
or
years
but
where
these
suggestions
are
ignored
he
may
be
guilty
of
doing
such
violence
to
the
sense
of
propriety
of
the
bride
or
so
injure
her
physically
as
to
make
himself
the
heir
of
greatest
unhappiness
for
the
remainder
of
his
married
life
his
thought
should
not
only
be
concerning
himself
but
especially
concerning
the
deliverance
of
his
bride
from
a
life
of
invalidism
and
wretchedness
it
seems
to
us
that
no
wrong
which
one
might
do
in
his
ignorance
could
bring
greater
remorse
and
regret
than
the
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
without
knowing
it
he
had
destroyed
both
the
health
and
the
happiness
of
one
who
otherwise
would
have
been
a
joy
and
blessing
throughout
his
entire
life
in
medical
books
designed
for
the
profession
much
space
is
properly
given
to
the
consideration
of
defects
deformities
and
monstrosities
but
in
a
book
like
this
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
ordinary
individual
such
rare
and
exceptional
instances
need
not
be
included
marked
abnormal
conditions
are
not
often
seen
in
the
practice
of
an
ordinary
physician
and
it
is
therefore
wrong
to
yield
to
the
tendency
to
arouse
unnecessary
apprehensions
which
can
serve
no
useful
purpose
but
which
often
do
result
in
injury
to
the
reader
where
there
exists
sufficient
evidence
of
any
serious
difficulty
or
physical
incapacity
the
young
man
should
not
fail
to
consult
an
experienced
physician
of
known
honor
and
christian
integrity
such
a
man
will
not
betray
your
confidence
and
will
be
able
to
afford
any
necessary
relief
and
to
give
judicious
counsel
and
timely
assistance
never
under
any
circumstances
apply
to
the
quack
the
shark
or
the
charlatan
whose
only
purpose
will
be
to
frighten
and
alarm
in
order
that
they
may
the
more
successfully
extort
money
from
the
uninformed
in
return
for
which
they
can
expect
nothing
better
than
impoverishment
and
humiliation
instead
of
wise
counsel
and
skillful
treatment
but
we
must
at
this
point
speak
of
the
kindred
subject
of
the
apprehensions
which
expectant
young
husbands
often
feel
with
reference
to
the
qualification
of
the
intended
bride
as
we
have
already
said
deformities
and
actual
incapacity
are
less
frequent
among
women
than
among
men
women
who
know
themselves
to
be
suffering
from
falling
of
the
womb
or
other
serious
womb
trouble
should
not
contemplate
marriage
by
becoming
a
wife
a
woman
with
serious
womb
trouble
only
aggravates
her
condition
renders
herself
and
her
husband
miserable
does
the
very
thing
which
will
retard
her
recovery
and
is
even
in
danger
of
rendering
herself
wholly
incurable
women
who
know
themselves
to
be
suffering
from
such
ills
and
ailments
should
always
seek
competent
medical
assistance
cut
their
devote
themselves
faithfully
to
physical
culture
and
defer
their
marriage
until
they
have
restored
these
parts
to
a
state
of
health
where
either
married
or
unmarried
women
suffer
from
female
weakness
they
are
generally
loath
to
seek
competent
medical
relief
we
have
known
of
married
women
who
have
suffered
for
many
years
the
results
of
injuries
received
during
confinement
who
could
easily
have
been
not
only
relieved
but
permanently
cured
had
they
applied
to
a
competent
physician
disclosed
their
real
condition
and
submitted
to
intelligent
treatment
the
same
is
true
of
young
married
people
where
any
slight
incapacity
or
obstacle
is
found
in
their
new
relation
they
should
promptly
seek
some
competent
medical
advisers
and
not
permit
weeks
to
elapse
until
on
account
of
their
neglect
that
which
could
easily
have
been
remedied
in
the
beginning
has
become
the
source
of
embarrassment
estrangement
or
possibly
some
permanent
nervous
affection
where
it
is
the
wife
who
needs
medical
attention
her
modest
nature
may
cause
her
to
shrink
from
examination
or
counsel
but
when
she
remembers
that
medical
specialists
are
constantly
consulted
upon
kindred
subjects
there
should
be
no
hesitation
in
seeking
their
counsel
and
assistance
the
utmost
frankness
on
the
part
of
the
patient
should
always
enable
the
physician
intelligently
to
understand
her
condition
while
that
native
female
modesty
which
is
the
attestation
of
her
virtue
will
be
both
her
adornment
and
her
defense
with
the
increasing
number
of
doctors
intending
brides
in
increasing
numbers
are
wisely
seeking
such
counsel
as
will
assure
them
that
there
exists
no
impediment
to
the
formation
of
a
happy
marriage
were
this
course
universally
followed
it
would
remove
much
mental
anxiety
possible
perplexity
and
even
marital
infelicity
it
would
disclose
to
those
who
have
serious
womb
trouble
their
unfitness
to
become
wives
and
mothers
and
thus
enable
the
unfortunate
ones
to
escape
the
unhappiness
and
misery
which
marriage
is
sure
to
bring
both
to
them
and
to
their
husbands
it
is
always
infinitely
better
to
know
the
facts
before
it
is
too
late
to
escape
the
wretchedness
which
the
marital
relation
is
sure
to
entail
and
then
where
no
infirmities
or
barriers
exist
the
knowledge
of
that
fact
will
bring
an
assurance
which
will
be
worth
many
times
the
embarrassment
and
expense
involved
this
is
the
legitimate
reliable
and
proper
way
for
every
intending
bride
to
secure
such
information
and
the
only
way
to
which
a
virtuous
and
woman
could
yield
her
consent
chapter

purity
and
fidelity
the
happiness
of
the
individual
and
of
the
family
often
depends
upon
the
influence
and
effects
of
very
plain
and
everyday
considerations
and
in
closing
part
first
there
are
a
few
things
which
we
desire
to
impress
upon
the
mind
of
the
young
husband
which
to
some
may
seem
unimportant
but
which
in
fact
are
very
important
and
your
failure
duly
to
observe
any
one
of
which
may
result
in
your
home
as
it
has
in
thousands
of
others
in
the
blighting
of
happiness
in
personal
injury
in
injustice
and
wrong
to
wife
and
children
and
even
in
the
wrecking
of
the
home
itself
see
to
it
that
you
have
a
pure
breath
you
have
no
right
to
defile
your
body
or
render
your
breath
impure
or
offensive
in
any
way
and
especially
by
the
use
of
tobacco
and
liquor
you
have
no
more
right
to
defile
the
air
which
your
wife
is
to
breathe
than
you
have
to
defile
the
water
which
she
is
to
drink
or
to
sprinkle
some
disagreeable
or
loathsome
substance
upon
the
food
which
she
is
to
eat
and
the
magnitude
of
this
wrong
would
be
increased
in
proportion
to
the
extent
to
which
it
adds
to
her
discomfort
or
injures
her
health
to
say
the
least
the
use
of
tobacco
is
a
selfish
habit
and
if
you
desire
to
be
just
and
equal
you
should
be
willing
to
apportion
to
your
wife
for
some
personal
gratification
of
her
own
an
amount
equal
to
the
money
which
you
daily
or
annually
expend
upon
yourself
for
the
use
of
tobacco
the
tobacco
habit
is
an
expensive
one
it
not
only
costs
an
expenditure
of
a
large
amount
of
money
annually
but
results
almost
universally
in
nervousness
and
irritability
if
you
use
tobacco
in
any
form
and
will
observe
yourself
closely
noting
the
difference
between
the
periods
when
you
omit
its
use
and
when
upon
the
other
hand
you
do
not
use
it
you
will
be
convinced
that
it
tends
very
perceptibly
to
render
you
sensitive
irritable
and
uncompanionable
but
this
is
not
all
it
so
permeates
your
entire
being
as
seriously
to
affect
the
children
which
you
beget
and
bring
into
the
world
no
man
we
care
not
how
indifferent
he
may
be
to
the
effect
upon
himself
or
to
the
comfort
of
his
wife
can
be
so
insensible
to
the
effect
of
his
own
life
in
determining
the
character
happiness
and
destiny
of
his
children
as
to
be
indifferent
to
the
consideration
of
the
results
of
the
use
of
tobacco
upon
his
descendants
you
may
often
have
noticed
that
men
and
women
of
good
physique
and
apparently
enjoying
the
best
of
health
become
the
parents
of
weak
nervous
and
sickly
children
it
would
be
both
unjust
and
untrue
to
assert
that
in
every
such
instance
the
result
could
be
accurately
traced
to
the
use
of
tobacco
but
the
evidence
that
tobacco
is
the
real
cause
can
be
established
in
at
least
instances
many
a
child
of
inferior
physical
and
intellectual
capacity
has
been
defrauded
of
its
larger
endowment
because
the
father
who
begot
it
was
addicted
to
the
use
of
tobacco
if
the
teachings
of
the
most
reliable
medical
authority
upon
this
subject
are
to
be
accepted
it
would
be
possible
to
select
from
any
community
the
finest
physical
and
intellectual
specimens
of
men
and
women
and
let
them
both
become
addicted
to
the
use
of
tobacco
and
then
marry
among
themselves
and
in
a
single
generation
or
two
their
descendants
would
fall
far
below
the
physical
and
intellectual
average
of
the
children
of
other
parents
who
do
not
use
the
weed
in
any
form
the
subject
of
intemperance
we
have
fully
treated
in
the
preceding
volumes
of
this
series
and
we
must
refer
the
reader
to
them
in
that
place
especially
the
book
addressed
to
young
men
liquor
is
not
only
a
curse
to
the
individual
who
uses
it
but
it
wrecks
the
health
and
happiness
of
the
wife
and
curses
their
yet
unborn
children
it
not
only
affects
their
morals
health
and
intelligence
but
where
the
children
are
not
born
imbeciles
or
idiots
they
often
inherit
the
appetite
for
drink
and
become
depraved
and
drunken
to
the
third
and
fourth
generation
the
great
minds
which
have
shone
in
the
intellectual
firmament
of
the
past
or
brighten
and
bless
the
present
generation
were
not
begotten
of
parents
who
were
given
to
excess
and
dissipation
many
a
man
whose
descendants
might
have
been
lustrous
and
happy
owe
their
enfeebled
minds
and
blighted
happiness
to
the
indiscretion
and
excess
of
the
parents
who
brought
them
into
the
world
when
god
designed
to
raise
up
a
samson
he
said
to
the
mother
thou
shalt
conceive

a

now
therefore
beware
i
pray
thee
and
drink
not
wine
nor

eat
not
any

unto
god
from

and
he
shall

out

the

and
they
can
not
be
ignored
without
imperiling

health
and
the
happiness
of
those
who
are
to
come
after
us
if
you
love
your

or
value
your
own

let
us
urge
upon
you
the
duty
of
fidelity
this
is
a
duty
that
you
owe
to
your
wife
in
the
same
proportion
that
she
owes
fidelity
to
you
god

one
standard
of

this
is
enjoined
alike
upon
men
and
women
god
says
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
he
does
not
say
women
shall
not
or
that
men
shall
not
there
is
no
discrimination
between
men
and

the
word
thou
means
the

who
reads

it
is

binding
upon
all
without
abatement
or
modification
regardless
of
sex
race

or

and
without
reference
to

or

what
is
true
of
this
commandment
is
also
true
of
them
all
god
has
not
made
one
set
of
laws
for
men
and
another
for
women
neither
does
he
excuse
or
condone
in
men
what
he
condemns
in
women
he
holds
both
alike
answerable
to
the
same
unerring
standards
of
social
and
moral
purity
whatever
may
be
the
attitude
of
those
who
entertain
lax
moral
views
society
has
no
right
to
condone
in
man
what
it
condemns
in
woman
what
is
wrong
for
her
is
wrong
for
him
and
infidelity
or
unfaithfulness
is
a
crime
in
either
in
addition
to
the
moral
wrong
there
is
also
the
great
physical
risk
the
unmarried
man
who
leads
a
life
of
vice
to
some
extent
at
least
only
imperils
himself
but
the
married
man
imperils
his
wife
and
his
children
in
addition
the
most
reputable
physicians
can
bear
ample
testimony
to
the
frequency
that
women
apply
to
them
for
relief
from
aches
and
ills
suffered
by
themselves
and
their
children
the
nature
and
source
of
which
these
wives
do
not
suspect
and
the
terrible
and
ineradicable
nature
of
which
they
are
totally
ignorant
such
is
the
terrible
punishment
inflicted
by
guilty
husbands
and
fathers
upon
their
innocent
and
unsuspecting
wives
and
children
hundreds
of
cases
might
be
named
but
let
us
give
a
single
illustration
narrated
to
us
by
one
of
the
most
eminent
physicians
of
this
country
whose
name
and
residence
are
not
essential
as
somewhat
similar
instances
come
frequently
to
the
attention
of
physicians
a
young
man
of
a
wealthy
family
who
had
been
a
couple
of
times
treated
for
gonorrhœa
married
a
beautiful
bride
in
a
prominent
and
wealthy
family
a
couple
of
weeks
after
his
marriage
he
came
to
the
physician
with
one
of
those
small
sores
called
a
chancre
which
is
the
unmistakable
evidence
of
the
presence
of
syphilis
careful
investigation
disclosed
the
fact
that
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
he
had
a
concealed
chancre
and
which
although
unknown
to
himself
had
nevertheless
been
communicated
to
his
bride
the
treatment
was
prompt
and
of
the
most
skillful
character
but
serious
results
were
speedily
manifest
the
primary
sore
was
followed
by
its
secondary
results
sores
appeared
upon
the
different
parts
of
her
body
the
mucous
membrane
was
affected
and
every
hair
upon
the
entire
person
of
the
wife
fell
out
she
did
not
have
left
so
much
as
eyebrows
eyelashes
or
even
hairs
in
her
nose
and
as
in
some
instances
after
a
serious
attack
of
typhoid
fever
months
were
necessary
before
the
hair
started
again
to
grow
when
it
did
grow
it
returned
coarse
and
wiry
and
when
about
an
inch
or
long
it
very
much
resembled
goat
hair
it
could
not
be
combed
nothing
could
be
done
with
it
she
looked
like
a
fright
was
an
astonishment
to
her
friends
and
an
embarrassment
to
herself
with
no
knowledge
of
the
terrible
nature
of
her
disease
it
was
difficult
to
induce
her
to
persist
through
months
for
a
period
of
at
least
two
years
in
taking
her
medicines
at
intervals
during
the
years
that
followed
she
gave
premature
birth
to
children
which
whether
born
dead
or
living
for
a
day
or
two
were
masses
of
disease
and
corruption
after
four
or
five
of
such
miscarriages
she
finally
gave
birth
to
a
child
that
at
the
time
of
its
coming
into
the
world
seemed
healthy
not
long
after
the
birth
of
this
child
the
family
removed
from
the
community
and
the
physician
was
unable
to
note
the
effects
of
the
inheritance
which
no
child
under
such
circumstances
could
possibly
escape
while
this
case
was
impressive
it
was
by
no
means
exceptional
we
have
learned
of
instances
where
persons
of
unbounded
wealth
have
communicated
the
syphilis
to
their
wives
and
all
the
skill
which
wealth
could
command
has
not
been
able
to
eradicate
the
disease
or
deliver
the
unhappy
sufferers
from
the
consequences
of
the
criminal
unfaithfulness
of
the
guilty
husband
but
there
are
consequences
less
manifest
to
the
eye
but
no
less
deadly
and
destructive
in
effect
which
come
to
the
innocent
and
unoffending
wife
as
the
result
of
the
vice
and
unfaithfulness
of
her
husband
one
of
the
most
eminent
physicians
of
philadelphia
in
conversation
with
the
author
assured
us
that
the
effects
of
gonorrhœa
or
clap
which
are
suffered
by
the
wives
is
something
alarming
even
where
the
husband
has
not
communicated
the
disease
while
it
was
active
in
himself
but
where
the
intending
husband
may
have
supposed
that
he
was
entirely
cured
of
gonorrhœa
for
a
period
of
two
years
or
more
he
may
yet
communicate
the
lurking
remnants
of
that
disease
to
the
vagina
the
effects
soon
extending
up
into
the
womb
out
through
the
fallopian
tubes
oftentimes
reaching
the
ovaries
and
necessitating
their
removal
making
it
necessary
to
unsex
the
woman
in
order
to
save
her
from
the
wretchedness
and
misery
which
are
inseparable
from
the
death
which
they
so
often
preface
an
eminent
practitioner
in
new
york
when
addressing
the
last
annual
convention
of
the
state
medical
society
called
special
attention
to
the
prevalent
effects
which
wives
suffer
as
the
result
of
gonorrhœa
contracted
by
their
husbands
and
said
that
a
few
years
ago
it
was
his
custom
when
women
with
certain
symptoms
came
to
him
for
consultation
to
request
a
private
interview
with
the
husbands
in
order
that
he
might
discover
whether
past
unfaithfulness
since
marriage
or
a
life
of
vice
prior
to
marriage
was
not
the
cause
of
the
trouble
he
said
that
latterly
however
the
best
medical
authorities
were
agreed
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
subject
the
husband
to
this
trying
inquisition
for
the
symptoms
and
conditions
which
established
the
correctness
of
the
diagnosis
were
a
sufficient
proof
of
the
source
of
all
the
troubles
thousands
of
husbands
who
bemoan
the
fact
that
their
wives
are
complete
physical
wrecks
are
themselves
the
authors
of
the
ruin
which
has
been
wrought
nor
is
this
all
fathers
have
often
carried
the
disease
home
and
by
the
use
of
towels
have
communicated
the
virus
of
the
disease
to
the
eyes
of
their
children
or
some
member
of
the
family
from
which
total
blindness
has
come
as
the
inevitable
result
we
learned
of
one
instance
in
which
the
father
communicated
the
disease
to
his
entire
family
including
several
small
children
who
took
their
bath
in
the
same
tub
but
in
different
water
after
the
father
had
bathed
for
a
fuller
unfolding
of
the
awful
consequences
of
the
diseases
which
accompany
vice
we
must
refer
the
reader
to
the
book
what
a
young
man
ought
to
know
from
page
to
all
that
has
there
been
said
in
favor
of
a
chaste
and
pure
life
can
be
enjoined
with
even
greater
emphasis
on
those
who
are
married
but
what
if
a
guilty
husband
and
father
could
escape
the
dangers
of
disease
the
detection
by
his
wife
and
could
even
escape
the
lashings
of
his
own
guilty
conscience
which
will
smite
with
sevenfold
force
as
the
years
advance
yet
how
terrible
for
him
to
remember
that
transmission
is
the
law
of
heredity
and
that
a
licentious
father
is
the
legitimate
predecessor
of
a
vicious
child
is
it
comforting
for
a
father
to
anticipate
with
certainty
that
all
the
vices
which
have
corrupted
his
life
blighted
his
home
and
debased
his
moral
nature
are
to
be
transmitted
to
his
offspring
how
shall
he
in
the
after
years
when
his
own
children
go
wrong
be
comforted
with
the
thought
that
what
they
are
he
was
and
that
what
he
desires
them
to
be
is
what
he
himself
should
have
been
julia
the
daughter
of
augustus
was
as
bad
as
her
father
and
gave
birth
to
a
child
of
equally
strong
propensities
these
are
the
influences
which
have
not
only
destroyed
the
happiness
of
homes
but
have
wrecked
the
destinies
of
nations
by
the
love
you
bear
your
wife
by
the
love
which
you
have
for
your
children
which
are
and
which
are
to
be
by
the
respect
which
you
have
for
yourself
and
the
fear
that
you
should
have
for
your
god
by
all
that
is
sacred
in
marriage
and
in
home
by
all
that
is
desired
in
this
world
and
in
the
world
to
come
we
plead
with
you
for
your
present
future
and
eternal
good
that
you
maintain
your
marriage
vow
inviolate
part
ii
concerning
his
wife
chapter
ix
the
bride
we
now
come
in
part
second
to
consider
what
a
young
husband
ought
to
know
concerning
his
wife
in
this
chapter
we
desire
to
speak
of
what
he
ought
to
know
of
his
wife
while
she
is
yet
a
bride
as
soon
as
the
minister
has
pronounced
them
husband
and
wife
she
is
as
truly
the
wife
as
she
is
later
on
and
we
only
use
the
word
bride
in
that
commonly
accepted
sense
which
refers
to
the
earlier
days
and
weeks
of
her
married
life
we
can
not
enter
upon
the
thought
of
this
chapter
without
being
conscious
of
the
fact
that
doubtless
thousands
of
young
men
will
turn
to
these
pages
for
information
concerning
the
marriage
relation
who
have
themselves
not
yet
entered
the
marriage
bond
there
is
nothing
in
this
book
which
a
young
man
of
mature
years
may
not
properly
know
indeed
every
young
man
of
mature
years
ought
to
possess
the
information
which
this
volume
contains
but
we
are
also
conscious
of
the
fact
that
many
young
men
who
are
engaged
to
marry
or
are
already
married
will
turn
to
these
pages
expecting
to
find
here
some
means
of
deliverance
from
the
results
of
mistakes
which
in
his
lack
of
knowledge
he
has
already
made
as
we
enter
upon
the
duty
of
telling
the
young
husband
what
he
ought
to
know
concerning
his
bride
we
feel
the
importance
of
saying
that
the
information
which
he
gathers
from
these
pages
will
be
but
partial
unless
he
has
the
information
concerning
woman
contained
in
the
preceding
volume
of
this
series
in
telling
a
young
husband
what
he
ought
to
know
concerning
his
bride
it
is
especially
important
that
he
should
first
understand
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
reproductive
organs
the
right
relation
of
man
to
woman
and
the
correct
teachings
concerning
marriage
and
for
the
unfolding
of
these
subjects
we
must
refer
the
reader
to
chapters
viii
and
ix
in
what
a
young
man
ought
to
know
in
addition
to
what
we
have
said
in
chapter
iii
of
this
volume
in
reference
to
the
physical
intellectual
moral
and
sexual
differences
between
men
and
women
it
is
necessary
now
to
call
the
attention
of
young
husbands
to
the
fact
that
in
woman
there
exists
less
sexual
desire
and
satisfaction
than
in
man
perhaps
of
the
great
majority
of
women
it
would
be
true
to
say
that
they
are
largely
devoid
of
sexual
pleasure
in
regard
to
the
intensity
of
the
sexual
instinct
women
might
with
some
accuracy
be
divided
into
three
classes
the
first
class
which
includes
the
larger
number
is
generally
supposed
to
be
quite
devoid
of
sexual
inclination
and
feeling
the
condition
of
this
class
may
be
accounted
for
in
three
different
ways
in
some
it
is
the
result
of
ill
health
produced
by
lack
of
sufficient
exercise
and
outdoor
recreation
because
of
excessive
social
demands
late
hours
indigestible
food
the
enervating
and
exhaustive
effects
of
and
especially
also
of
tight
lacing
with
all
of
its
sad
effects
in
debilitating
and
displacing
the
sexual
and
vital
organs
which
are
located
in
the
pelvic
and
abdominal
cavities
if
women
could
but
realize
what
pleasures
might
be
theirs
if
they
would
only
live
in
a
rational
way
there
would
be
but
few
men
and
women
left
to
ask
the
question
whether
marriage
is
a
failure
another
cause
of
sexual
indifference
in
a
large
class
is
found
in
the
fact
that
some
regard
the
existence
of
passion
in
women
as
derogatory
to
their
sex
there
are
wives
who
pride
themselves
upon
their
indifference
to
the
conjugal
relation
they
speak
of
their
coldness
and
indifference
as
though
it
were
a
virtue
instead
of
a
defect
the
fact
is
they
are
simply
proud
of
their
deficiency
with
this
as
with
the
proper
exercise
of
every
other
bodily
function
god
has
associated
satisfaction
and
pleasure
the
reception
of
food
which
is
to
sustain
and
nourish
life
is
attended
with
pleasure
seeing
and
hearing
are
attended
with
pleasure
the
exercise
of
all
of
our
bodily
senses
is
designed
to
bring
us
pleasure
and
a
sense
of
satisfaction
the
exercise
of
the
reproductive
function
is
attended
with
great
cost
physically
financially
and
in
every
way
and
god
has
meant
that
to
this
great
sacrifice
man
shall
be
prompted
by
a
pleasure
which
shall
be
correspondingly
great
god
has
designed
that
the
act
of
reproduction
should
be
recognized
both
as
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
and
the
feeling
which
prompts
to
the
perpetuation
of
the
species
is
as
proper
as
that
which
inclines
the
individual
to
the
preservation
of
his
own
life
or
health
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
in
conception
god
has
assigned
an
important
office
to
inclination
and
sensation
for
while
authorities
are
agreed
that
conception
may
take
place
without
attendant
emotion
upon
the
part
of
the
female
yet
the
result
is
more
assured
and
the
product
of
such
a
union
is
of
a
higher
standard
when
both
persons
participate
in
the
pleasures
which
invite
to
its
consummation
this
sexual
indifference
upon
the
part
of
the
wife
may
sometimes
be
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
she
and
her
husband
are
illy
mated
physically
morally
or
socially
or
because
differences
of
education
and
divergence
of
views
have
produced
that
lack
of
harmony
which
has
at
least
measurably
blighted
the
affections
there
can
be
but
little
doubt
that
much
marital
indifference
upon
the
part
of
wives
is
due
to
chronic
constipation
which
is
so
prevalent
among
women
another
cause
of
this
indifference
upon
the
part
of
some
wives
and
this
is
a
very
small
class
is
due
to
malformation
local
obstruction
because
of
an
imperfect
rupturing
of
the
hymen
or
in
rare
instances
to
a
disease
known
as
vaginismus
rendering
the
act
not
only
devoid
of
pleasure
but
possessed
of
actual
discomfort
and
suffering
where
these
conditions
exist
prompt
and
competent
medical
assistance
is
needed
for
local
treatment
and
judicious
advice
the
second
class
is
composed
of
women
who
find
in
the
marital
relation
a
moderate
and
normal
pleasure
when
they
are
in
health
and
if
indulged
in
at
times
which
are
agreeable
to
them
and
at
suitable
intervals
this
class
represents
doubtless
those
women
who
are
more
normal
in
this
respect
than
those
who
belong
to
either
of
the
other
extremes
they
constitute
the
middle
class
and
probably
the
largest
number
the
third
class
represents
the
few
in
whom
sexuality
presides
as
a
ruling
passion
this
class
is
by
no
means
as
numerous
as
some
might
imagine
and
such
women
should
never
be
married
except
to
men
of
good
health
strong
physique
large
powers
of
endurance
and
with
a
pronounced
sexual
inclination
when
a
man
with
only
moderate
sexual
inclination
is
united
to
a
woman
of
this
class
it
is
a
question
which
is
more
to
be
pitied
the
husband
whose
wife
is
totally
devoid
of
sexual
instinct
or
the
man
whose
wife
is
sexually
insatiable
while
there
are
a
few
women
of
this
class
yet
the
rule
remains
that
in
man
the
sexual
instinct
is
more
pronounced
than
in
woman
and
that
man
constitutes
the
active
and
aggressive
division
of
the
human
family
for
while
a
certain
female
may
possess
a
more
pronounced
sexual
nature
than
a
certain
male
yet
in
her
sexual
nature
she
is
not
as
pronounced
as
the
most
active
male
while
among
all
species
the
male
is
the
more
active
and
aggressive
yet
any
one
who
has
given
attention
to
the
reproductive
act
among
animals
will
have
noticed
that
in
no
instance
can
the
male
force
this
relation
upon
the
female
without
her
acquiescence
and
in
most
instances
the
time
of
copulation
is
wholly
determined
by
the
condition
of
the
female
it
is
only
when
she
is
in
condition
to
conceive
that
she
will
receive
the
male
and
at
those
periods
her
condition
inspires
him
to
the
act
we
can
not
but
believe
that
this
is
also
intended
to
be
the
rule
among
human
beings
although
strange
to
say
the
wishes
of
the
wife
are
oftentimes
wholly
ignored
and
she
submits
reluctantly
or
is
wholly
overborne
by
the
exactions
of
an
inconsiderate
or
brutal
husband
if
this
subjugation
of
the
wish
and
the
will
of
the
wife
to
the
will
of
the
husband
is
the
result
of
the
curse
pronounced
upon
eve
thy
desire
shall
be
to
thy
husband
the
chastisement
of
woman
has
been
truly
severe
for
no
sorer
punishment
could
well
be
inflicted
than
to
be
deprived
of
the
right
of
ruling
over
one
own
body
and
being
placed
in
subjection
to
the
capricious
will
and
exacting
demands
of
an
unreasonable
husband
if
the
wrongs
which
wives
suffer
in
this
respect
are
the
result
of
the
fall
of
our
first
parents
we
should
nevertheless
rejoice
that
now
the
spiritual
and
material
blessings
which
have
been
restored
by
the
second
adam
are
also
to
be
shared
by
woman
and
in
all
the
world
no
other
person
should
be
so
anxious
to
crown
her
with
the
fullness
of
her
natural
rights
as
the
man
who
will
by
such
an
effort
vindicate
the
nobility
of
his
own
manhood
and
secure
for
himself
the
largest
blessing
and
happiness
because
he
is
her
husband
not
only
is
the
reproductive
nature
of
woman
less
pronounced
than
in
man
but
its
continuance
in
her
is
of
a
much
shorter
duration
at
about
years
of
age
and
in
some
very
much
earlier
the
reproductive
nature
of
woman
undergoes
those
changes
which
render
conception
and
childbearing
impossible
at
that
period
her
sexual
nature
takes
upon
itself
modifications
which
are
more
pronounced
than
those
experienced
by
the
male
when
a
somewhat
similar
sexual
hush
comes
to
him
the
character
of
these
changes
and
what
they
involve
both
to
the
husband
and
to
the
wife
are
treated
at
length
in
the
fourth
volume
of
this
series
addressed
to
men
at
and
it
is
well
that
young
husbands
should
know
what
the
future
has
in
store
for
them
and
so
regulate
their
married
life
that
the
later
years
may
bring
them
the
largest
possible
good
and
blessing
the
effect
of
the
sexual
relation
upon
men
and
women
is
oftentimes
very
noticeable
sometimes
those
who
previously
seemed
hearty
and
strong
lose
their
bloom
and
vigor
and
become
emaciated
and
miserable
sometimes
the
reverse
is
the
case
especially
among
women
there
are
noticeable
instances
where
the
family
heredity
is
good
no
organic
trouble
exists
and
yet
the
individual
is
wholly
miserable
and
after
marriage
speedily
develops
into
a
strong
and
hearty
woman
there
are
some
who
improve
somewhat
in
health
but
who
avoid
parenthood
and
thus
defraud
themselves
of
the
acquisition
of
perfect
health
these
cases
however
are
rather
the
exception
and
so
much
is
involved
in
marriage
that
no
man
or
woman
can
afford
to
take
such
serious
risks
because
exceptional
instances
do
rarely
occur
yet
the
fact
remains
that
there
are
some
who
are
weak
and
worried
and
restless
before
marriage
who
become
hopeful
restful
and
strong
after
marriage
while
others
who
were
well
situated
and
contented
in
their
sphere
accept
in
marriage
conditions
which
result
in
producing
a
nervous
despondent
and
restless
disposition
if
the
marital
relation
of
these
people
could
be
accurately
known
the
cause
of
these
noticeable
changes
might
oftentimes
be
found
in
the
moderation
maintained
by
the
one
class
and
the
excessive
sexual
indulgence
the
cause
in
the
other
sexual
excess
is
quite
common
among
married
persons
in
the
husband
it
results
in
the
destruction
of
physical
power
and
in
the
weakening
of
the
intellect
as
well
force
used
in
this
way
is
not
available
for
use
intellectually
and
the
consequent
effects
unfit
for
study
mental
activity
and
oftentimes
for
all
kinds
of
business
it
renders
the
husband
nervous
morose
and
uncompanionable
the
man
who
is
guilty
of
excess
not
only
destroys
his
own
capacity
for
pleasure
but
is
alike
unjust
to
his
wife
he
renders
her
incapable
of
marital
pleasure
and
also
renders
her
incapable
of
bringing
to
him
the
satisfaction
which
he
seeks
such
a
husband
destroys
the
amiability
of
his
wife
renders
her
weak
and
nervous
converts
her
into
an
invalid
and
imposes
upon
himself
large
financial
outlays
for
medical
advice
and
attendance
such
a
husband
deliberately
but
not
always
knowingly
consumes
and
destroys
the
physical
qualities
which
made
the
wife
attractive
to
him
and
destroys
the
very
foundation
upon
which
all
happiness
in
the
home
must
rest
excessive
sexual
tendencies
among
men
are
generally
the
result
of
early
later
illicit
relations
reveling
in
vile
stories
nude
pictures
the
reading
of
suggestive
novels
the
polluting
of
the
imagination
and
incorrect
ideas
of
the
proper
relation
in
marriage
thought
is
allowed
to
dwell
too
much
upon
these
subjects
the
flow
of
blood
to
the
sexual
parts
becomes
excessive
and
the
only
remedy
is
by
purifying
the
mind
correcting
the
ideas
resolutely
determining
to
be
moderate
and
considerate
removing
all
causes
of
undue
sexual
excitement
resorting
to
the
bath

judicious
in
the
diet
giving
due
consideration
to
physical
culture
and
taking
such
an
amount
of
exercise
daily
as
is
calculated
to
secure
the
best
physical
results
and
most
effectual
sexual
mastery
the
man
who
needs
to
be
helped
in
the
direction
of
moderation
would
do
well
to
confide
in
his
wife
that
her
influence
over
him
may

in
other

chapter
x
the
care
of
the
bride
few
young
husbands
are
intelligent
guardians
of
their
brides
indeed
when
first
entering
upon
the
marriage
relation
young
husbands
are
in
danger
of
making
some
very
serious
mistakes
many
a
husband
has
had
cause
to
regret
that
in
his
lack
of
consideration
he
has
allowed
his
passion
to
awaken
in
his
wife
such
a
feeling
of
disgust
as
to
obliterate
her
affection
for
him
to
blast
the
prospects
of
all
future
happiness
and
render
both
himself
and
wife
miserable
throughout
all
their
subsequent
years
in
the
first
place
a
young
husband
should
know
that
many
women
even
at
the
time
of
their
marriage
are
totally
ignorant
of
all
questions
relating
to
sex
there
are
some
women
who
do
not
so
much
as
know
that
there
are
any
physical
differences
between
men
and
women
there
are
others
who
may
know
there
is
some
difference
but
into
whose
minds
the
thought
of
coition
has
never
once
entered
while
this
may
not
be
true
in
a
majority
of
cases
yet
it
is
true
in
a
large
number
of
instances
we
have
even
known
of
young
wives
who
have
approached
the
period
of
their
first
confinement
who
did
not
know
the
cause
of
their
increasing
bodily
size
and
we
recently
learned
of
an
instance
where
the
physician
was
already
in
the
room
to
attend
the
expectant
mother
who
thought
that
she
was
to
be
delivered
of
her
child
by
a
surgical
operation
she
thought
that
the
doctor
was
to
make
an
incision
in
the
abdomen
and
remove
her
child
in
that
way
to
say
that
all
this
is
culpable
ignorance
does
not
however
remove
the
fact
young
husbands
do
well
to
recognize
the
fact
that
such
ignorance
exists
and
that
in
addition
to
such
possible
ignorance
upon
the
part
of
his
own
bride
there
is
that
general
condition
of
exhaustion
and
debility
which
follows
as
the
result
of
the
weeks
of
preparation
and
nervous
excitement
which
have
preceded
and
culminated
at
the
time
of
the
wedding
festivities
we
have
already
dwelt
upon
this
phase
of
the
subject
and
we
need
not
enlarge
upon
it
here
with
the
poor
it
is
weeks
and
sometimes
months
of
sewing
and
preparation
with
the
rich
it
is
the
meeting
of
social
exactions
and
requirements
formal
visitations
and
then
senseless
seclusion
in
each
instance
the
results
are
equally
enervating
bringing
most
brides
whether
rich
or
poor
to
the
one
great
event
in
their
lives
in
an
exhausted
and
nervous
condition
to
say
the
least
this
uniform
physical
depletion
entitles
the
bride
to
the
most
thoughtful
consideration
and
most
gentle
treatment
that
the
young
husband
can
exercise
with
ignorance
upon
the
one
side
inconsideration
and
ungovernable
passion
upon
the
other
the
combination
is
unfortunate
and
the
results
are
oftentimes
serious
the
first
act
in
the
drama
which
is
to
culminate
in
separation
and
an
effort
to
secure
a
divorce
is
often
enacted
upon
the
night
of
the
very
day
which
witnessed
the
marriage
ceremony
and
was
attended
with
the
congratulation
of
friends
the
ignorance
and
inconsiderateness
of
both
are
alike
to
blame
for
this
sad
result
the
wife
for
her
lack
of
knowledge
and
consideration
and
the
husband
for
his
lack
of
intelligent
and
thoughtful
appreciation
of
the
delicacies
and
dangers
of
his
new
relation
in
greece
the
custom
prevails
of
allowing
three
days
to
intervene
between
the
marriage
ceremony
and
the
consummation
of
marriage
it
would
be
well
if
such
a
custom
prevailed
everywhere
it
would
allow
the
exhausted
nervous
timid
bride
to
bring
to
the
consummation
of
the
marriage
relation
renewed
vigor
and
mental
composure
it
would
prepare
the
mind
of
the
young
husband
for
such
and
restraint
as
would
be
becoming
in
this
new
relation
and
would
secure
for
him
a
happiness
greatly
heightened
in
intensity
and
that
would
be
prolonged
through
all
the
years
that
lie
beyond
it
is
enough
to
make
a
thoughtful
and
considerate
man
blush
to
think
of
the
scores
of
wives
who
annually
confess
to
their
physicians
that
the
only
rape
that
was
ever
committed
upon
them
was
by
their
own
husbands
the
first
day
of
their
married
life
we
recently
heard
of
an
instance
where
the
expressed
impatience
and
manifest
impetuosity
of
the
young
husband
the
moment
he
came
into
the
bridal
chamber
with
his
young
wife
awakened
in
her
mind
such
a
feeling
of
disgust
that
after
a
brief
parleying
the
young
wife
left
the
room
and
refused
ever
to
return
to
her
husband
and
thus
terminated
abruptly
what
with
thoughtful
and
considerate
approaches
and
manifest
affection
might
have
resulted
in
a
union
of
lifelong
happiness
in
his
book
entitled
plain
talks
on
avoided
subjects
henry
guernsey
says
tenderly
and
with
great
consideration
should
these
privileges
be
accepted
for
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
many
men
there
is
no
sensual
passion
on
the
part
of
the
bride
that
induces
her
to
grant
such
liberties
then
how
exquisitely
gentle
and
how
forbearing
should
be
the
bridegroom
deportment
on
such
occasions
sometimes
such
a
shock
is
administered
to
her
sensibilities
that
she
does
not
recover
from
it
for
years
and
in
consequence
of
this
shock
rudely
or
ruthlessly
administered
she
forms
a
deeply
rooted
antipathy
against
the
very
act
which
is
the
bond
and
seal
of
a
truly
happy
married
life
duffey
in
her
book
entitled
the
relations
of
the
sexes
says
do
not
be
in
too
great
haste
to
brush
the
bloom
from
the
fruit
you
covet
it
will
lose
half
its
attractions
at
once
practice
in
lawful
wedlock
the
arts
of
the
seducer
rather
than
the
violence
of
the
man
who
commits
rape
and
you
will
find
the
reward
of
your
patience
very
sweet
and
lasting
this
bud
of
passion
can
not
be
forced
rudely
open
its
development
must
be
the
work
of
time
if
the
young
wife
is
met
with
violence
if
she
finds
that
her
husband
regards
the
gratification
of
his
own
desires
more
than
her
feelings
and
if
she
be
worn
and
wearied
with
excesses
in
the
early
days
of
her
married
life
the
bud
will
be
blighted
the
husband
will
have
only
himself
to
blame
if
he
is
bound
all
his
life
to
an
apathetic
irresponsive
wife
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
unsatisfactory
conjugal
relations
which
are
brought
about
in
punishment
of
the
husband
early
impetuosity
and
ignorance
he
finds
an
unreciprocal
wife
doubts
her
affection
for
him
because
with
his
masculine
nature
he
can
not
conceive
of
a
love
unblended
with
passion
she
in
her
defrauded
womanhood
feels
aggrieved
and
debased
by
any
conjugal
approach
especially
by
an
enforced
one
and
finds
it
equally
hard
to
understand
how
affection
and
passion
can
be
united
the
one
she
knows
to
be
so
and
denying
and
the
other
she
has
such
abundant
cause
for
believing
utterly
selfish
and
rapacious
the
excesses
which
are
likely
to
follow
after
the
earliest
experiences
of
married
life
are
also
to
be
cautiously
guarded
against
the
author
whom
we
have
just
quoted
says
i
will
venture
to
say
that
there
is
not
one
man
in
fifty
who
in
the
first
years
of
his
married
life
is
not
guilty
of
sexual
abuse
towards
his
wife
which
effect
is
alone
sufficient
to
account
for
the
great
prevalence
of
female
diseases
not
that
every
woman
is
injured
by
it
to
the
extent
of
inflammation
and
ulceration
yet
many
are
i
am
not
running
a
tilt
against
married
men
i
blame
them
for
no
intentional
wrong
only
for
ignorance
and
women
are
also
equally
to
blame
in
this
matter
they
are
just
as
ignorant
as
their
husbands
and
often
allow
themselves
to
yield
to
demands
or
importunities
when
if
they
were
to
consider
it
a
conscientious
duty
to
refuse
they
would
do
so
the
tender
delicate
organs
of
generation
in
women
are
often
abused
to
such
an
extent
by
too
frequent
use
that
they
become
inflamed
and
ulcerate
and
render
the
woman
an
invalid
even
the
husband
does
not
see
the
cause
or
measure
the
extent
of
his
folly
but
persists
in
his
selfish
course
in
spite
of
the
sufferings
he
causes
his
wife
constantly
aggravating
her
disorders
and
rendering
them
more
and
more
hopeless
of
cure
thus
the
husband
kind
and
attentive
in
all
other
matters
who
would
not
allow
the
winds
of
heaven
to
visit
the
cheek
of
his
wife
too
roughly
becomes
in
this
one
respect
a
very
i
was
about
to
say
brute
but
the
animal
creation
presents
no
parallel
case
so
i
find
no
appropriate
word
in
comparison
in
his
book
entitled
the
transmission
of
life
george
napheys
in
writing
upon
this
subject
says
the
consequence
is
that
in
repeated
instances
the
thoughtlessness
and
precipitancy
of
the
young
husband
lay
the
foundation
for
numerous
diseases
of
the
womb
and
nervous
system
for
the
gratification
of
a
night
he
forfeits
the
comfort
of
years
let
him
at
the
time
when
the
hours
have
at
last
brought
to
him
the
treasures
he
has
so
long
been
coveting
administer
with
a
frugal
hand
and
with
a
wise
forethought
let
him
be
considerate
temperate
and
he
will
never
regret
it
if
he
defer
for
days
the
exercise
of
those
privileges
which
the
law
now
gives
him
but
which
are
more
than
disappointing
if
seized
upon
in
an
arbitrary
coarse
or
brutal
manner
the
husband
should
be
aware
that
while
as
a
rule
the
first
conjugal
approaches
are
painful
to
the
new
wife
and
therefore
that
she
only
submits
and
can
not
enjoy
them
this
pain
should
not
be
excessively
severe
nor
should
it
last
for
any
great
length
of
time
not
more
than
one
or
two
weeks
should
the
case
be
otherwise
then
something
is
wrong
and
if
rest
does
not
restore
the
parts
a
physician
should
be
consulted
it
is
especially
necessary
that
great
moderation
be
observed
at
first
an
admonition
which
we
the
more
urgently
give
because
we
know
it
is
needed
because
those
specialists
who
devote
their
time
to
diseases
of
women
are
constantly
meeting
patients
who
date
their
months
and
years
of
misery
from
the
epoch
of
marriage
the
pain
and
inconvenience
to
which
the
doctor
refers
in
the
preceding
paragraph
is
oftentimes
due
to
the
presence
in
young
wives
of
what
is
known
as
the
hymen
this
is
a
thin
membrane
which
nature
places
near
the
lower
extremity
of
the
vaginal
passage
to
protect
the
delicate
linings
of
the
reproductive
organs
of
the
female
against
the
admission
of
any
foreign
substance
exposure
to
cold
or
any
other
influence
which
might
tend
to
the
injury
of
the
reproductive
nature
with
the
growth
of
the
body
this
membrane
sometimes
acquires
such
consistency
or
strength
that
the
rupturing
of
it
is
attended
with
inconvenience
and
oftentimes
with
much
pain
this
fact
alone
should
render
a
young
husband
very
considerate
dispassionate
and
thoughtful
the
pain
attendant
upon
the
rupturing
of
the
hymen
is
not
so
much
due
to
the
sensitiveness
of
the
membrane
itself
as
the
fact
that
it
adheres
to
the
walls
of
the
vagina
and
any
lateral
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
the
hymen
imposes
such
a
tension
where
the
hymen
is
attached
to
the
walls
of
the
vagina
as
to
produce
in
some
instances
at
least
intense
pain
the
rupturing
of
the
hymen
is
often
attended
with
a
small
quantity
of
blood
sometimes
scarcely
perceptible
and
at
other
times
more
considerable
it
was
at
one
time
thought
that
the
presence
of
the
hymen
was
an
unmistakable
evidence
of
virginity
and
its
absence
was
regarded
as
a
cause
for
suspicion
if
not
a
proof
of
previous
sexual
relation
while
it
is
true
that
in
most
virgins
the
hymen
does
exist
yet
we
do
not
have
the
slightest
hesitation
in
saying
that
it
does
not
exist
in
all
it
may
be
ruptured
and
destroyed
by
a
slight
accident
during
childhood
is
sometimes
even
destroyed
at
birth
in
abnormal
cases
it
may
need
to
be
destroyed
mechanically
by
the
family
physician
in
order
to
remove
it
as
an
impediment
in
the
more
easy
flow
of
the
monthly
period
duffey
in
what
women
should
know
when
writing
of
the
test
of
virginity
says
it
is
popularly
believed
that
the
husband
receives
proof
upon
the
consummation
of
his
marriage
of
the
previous
chastity
of
his
wife
if
he
obtains
this
evidence
it
is
safe
to
accept
it
as
conclusive
though
rare
exceptional
cases
are
to
be
met
with
in
which
the
evidence
counts
for
nothing
if
on
the
other
hand
the
proof
is
wanting
it
is
most
unjust
and
cruel
on
the
strength
of
this
alone
to
charge
a
wife
with
want
of
chastity
previous
to
marriage
it
is
not
uncommon
for
accidents
which
may
occur
at
any
time
and
which
may
even
date
back
to
birth
itself
to
destroy
this
evidence
or
it
may
never
have
existed
napheys
says
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
hymen
is
no
test
there
is
in
fact
no
sign
whatever
which
allows
even
an
expert
positively
to
say
that
a
woman
has
or
has
not
suffered
the
approaches
of
one
of
the
opposite
sex
the
true
and
only
test
which
any
man
should
look
for
is
modesty
in
demeanor
before
marriage
absence
both
of
assumed
ignorance
and
a
disagreeable
familiarity
and
a
pure
and
religious
frame
of
mind
where
these
are
present
he
need
not
doubt
that
he
has
a
faithful
and
chaste
wife
it
is
important
for
young
husbands
to
know
that
when
a
serious
inconvenience
is
experienced
in
the
consummation
of
marriage
if
not
easily
removed
by
care
and
consideration
but
remains
an
impediment
or
a
pain
for
a
period
of
days
or
of
a
couple
of
weeks
medical
advice
and
assistance
should
by
all
means
be
sought
in
the
case
of
women
who
have
advanced
in
years
before
marriage
such
difficulties
often
occur
and
medical
assistance
is
the
safest
most
sensible
and
speediest
source
of
delivery
we
can
not
pass
this
point
without
seeking
to
impress
upon
the
young
husband
the
danger
liable
to
result
from
the
use
of
wine
and
other
stimulants
upon
the
occasion
of
his
marriage
one
of
the
most
terrible
afflictions
which
can
come
to
any
home
is
the
birth
of
an
idiot
and
if
the
statements
of
medical
authority
are
to
be
relied
upon
the
birth
of
these
unfortunate
burdens
to
their
parents
is
due
to
their
conception
at
a
time
when
either
the
husband
or
the
wife
or
both
were
under
the
effects
of
stimulants
and
the
temporary
idiocy
of
an
inebriated
man
or
woman
has
been
transmitted
and
permanently
embodied
in
the
begetting
and
birth
of
a
child
that
has
been
robbed
of
its
rights
by
the
wrongs
of
its
parents
who
have
pulled
down
upon
their
own
heads
one
of
the
most
awful
and
prolonged
curses
which
could
be
suffered
as
a
result
of
a
human
mistake
note
also
carefully
the
fact
that
the
exhausted
physical
condition
of
the
bride
is
sure
to
result
in
an
enfeebled
offspring
should
conception
occur
before
she
has
regained
her
physical
powers
it
is
possible
that
the
exhausted
physical
condition
of
young
brides
and
that
the
excessive
indulgence
which
is
likely
to
follow
the
earlier
months
of
marriage
either
one
or
both
are
largely
the
chief
cause
or
causes
of
the
frightful
mortality
among
children
the
joys
of
the
are
not
only
noticeable
but
very
beautiful
the
outgoings
of
human
affection
are
as
beautiful
and
impressive
as
the
relation
of
the
birds
that
don
their
brightest
plumage
sing
their
sweetest
songs
and
build
their
nests
in
the
springtime
when
the
mating
instincts
and
emotional
nature
of
the
birds
reach
their
highest
and
most
animate
expression
a
young
bride
in
conversation
with
one
of
her
intimate
friends
in
alluding
to
her
happiness
said
it
is
too
good
to
last
the
fact
is
that
this
intensity
of
reproductive
activity
must
give
place
to
corresponding
of
considerable
length
or
depletion
and
death
would
ensue
as
the
inevitable
result
the
wave
not
only
can
not
but
it
should
not
always
remain
at
its
crest
but
it
must
subside
and
sink
in
order
that
it
may
regain
itself
and
rise
on
the
crest
of
a
new
wave
of
emotional
activity
the
pleasures
of
married
life
can
only
be
heightened
and
perpetuated
in
a
home
of
your
own

live
apart
by

wherever
such
a
course
is
at
all
possible
living
with
the

of
either

disadvantageous

dangerous

place

right
to
expect
that

and
honorable

result

any
medical
practitioner
can
testify
to
the
number
of
young
wives
who
have
besought
them
to
murder
their
unborn
children
because
they
were
boarding
and
it
was
not
convenient
to
have
a

a

incubus
it
will
take
the
color
out
of
the

it
will
despoil
the

a

of

these
irritate
bring
constant
annoyance
to
the

who
should
be
carefully
delivered
from
undue
anxiety
and
they
also
impose
large
outlays
of
money
for
which
neither

that

one

happiest
moments

that

enjoyable

her
know
that

that
she
puts
forth
and
as
the
months
and
the
years
go
by
do
not
think
a
repetition
of
praise
would
become
an
offending
monotony
to
her
a
wife
never
ceases
to
love
the
expressions
of
admiration
appreciation
and
affection
upon
the
part
of
her
husband
if
you
start
out
with
a
struggle
to
determine
whether
the
will
of
the
wife
or
the
will
of
the

shall
have
preference
and
you
may
reasonably
expect

each
seek
to
surpass

chapter
xi
the
young
wife
and
motherhood
in
a
previous
place
we
have
spoken
of
the
importance
of
industry
and
activity
as
important
elements
in
a
young
wife
and
as
essential
in
securing
success
for
the
family
happiness
in
the
home
and
bodily
health
and
vigor
for
the
wife
an
idle
woman
is
always
an
unhappy
woman
and
she
eventually
succeeds
in
making
every
one
unhappy
about
her
her
household
duties
are
no
misfortune
but
a
blessing
but
there
is
also
another
side
to
the
question
unthoughtful
husbands
do
not
always
appreciate
the
magnitude
of
the
duties
which
fall
to
the
successful
homemaker
and
homekeeper
her
duties
are
legion
we
do
not
now
speak
of
the
wives
who
live
in
affluence
who
never
need
to
regard
expense
who
have
only
to
indicate
their
wish
in
order
to
have
it
executed
but
of
the
great
multitude
of
wives
and
mothers
who
preside
in
the
homes
of
the
great
middle
class
and
of
those
who
struggle
with
the
economies
and
duties
in
homes
of
small
means
the
young
husband
should
appreciate
the
fact
that
if
the
beautiful
poetry
which
adorns
the
tombstones
in
our
cemeteries
could
be
translated
into
truthful
prose
they
would
tell
of
the
thousands
of
martyrs
to
mending
sewing
baking
scrubbing
they
would
tell
that
the
weapons
by
which
hundreds
of
these
housekeepers
were
slain
were
the
broom
the
the
cradle
and
the
ladle
the
thirty
years
war
was
not
so
severe
or
so
prolonged
as
the
warfare
which
is
waged
from
early
morning
till
late
at
night
by
the
great
army
of
industrious
wives
busy
mothers
and
anxious
homekeepers
if
the
boy
has
lost
his
book
or
the
girl
her
bonnet
mother
must
help
to
find
it
if
the
baby
coughs
or
cries
at
night
the
father
sleeps
on
oblivious
of
the
fact
but
the
infant
can
not
stir
without
being
heard
by
its
anxious
and
attentive
mother
if
sickness
compels
she
bends
in
anxious
vigils
over
the
little
life
that
lies
in
the
cradle
if
the
breadwinner
is
brought
home
sick
it
matters
not
how
manifold
the
duties
of
the
mother
no
trained
nurse
can
take
the
place
of
the
wife
at
the
bedside
in
health
and
in
sickness
in
prosperity
and
adversity
during
the
day
and
at
night
the
wife
and
the
mother
finds
herself
the
centre
of
duties
and
very
often
of
exactions
in
the
demands
which
a
young
husband
makes
upon
the
young
wife
he
should
remember
what
are
her
duties
and
requirements
during
the
day
in
the
home
in
the
church
in
society
in
the
community
he
should
remember
that
physically
she
is
the
weaker
vessel
that
even
when
in
her
best
physical
condition
sexual
inclination
is
largely
dormant
and
when
she
is
weary
and
worn
she
deserves
to
be
treated
with
more
than
usual
thoughtfulness
and
consideration
whatever
demands
the
young
husband
makes
upon
his
wife
whether
as
his
helper
or
the
participant
of
his
joys
he
should
remember
that
even
from
the
low
standpoint
of
selfish
interest
and
personal
pleasure
he
wrongs
himself
in
addition
to
being
unjust
and
oftentimes
cruel
to
his
wife
when
he
fails
to
take
into
consideration
her
physical
condition
and
manifold
duties
if
the
young
husband
and
wife
desire
to
be
permanently
happy
they
dare
not
ignore
the
special
purpose
for
which
god
instituted
marriage
while
marriage
has
other
purposes
yet
the
great
final
purpose
is
the
raising
up
of
a
family
and
the
perpetuation
of
the
human
race
the
injunction
which
god
gave
to
noah
when
he
said
be
ye
fruitful
and
multiply
bringing
forth
abundantly
in
the
earth
and
multiply
therein
is
and
ever
will
be
in
force
among
the
israelites
barrenness
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
greatest
of
misfortunes
in
many
instances
it
was
regarded
as
a
cause
of
personal
shame
and
even
of
dishonor
when
hannah
went
up
to
the
temple
and
prayed
for
a
son
she
was
only
giving
expression
to
the
longings
and
desires
which
filled
the
heart
of
every
barren
israelitish
woman
who
had
entered
into
the
sacred
bonds
of
marriage
and
when
god
promised
abraham
and
sarah
that
their
seed
should
be
in
multitude
as
the
stars
in
the
heavens
they
regarded
themselves
as
the
recipients
of
one
of
the
greatest
blessings
which
god
could
bestow
the
same
is
true
in
india
where
the
people
are
polygamists
in
theory
but
seldom
in
practice
except
when
the
first
wife
is
childless
the
family
must
not
be
left
without
a
priest
or
the
parents
without
descendants
therefore
the
husband
is
permitted
by
law
to
take
two
or
even
more
wives
in
order
that
he
may
raise
up
children
unto
himself
if
marriage
was
instituted
for
the
good
of
the
man
and
the
woman
who
enter
into
this
sacred
relation
their
highest
good
can
not
be
attained
in
this
relation
until
their
union
is
blessed
with
children
it
has
been
aptly
said
that
the
man
needs
the
woman
and
the
woman
needs
the
man
and
both
need
the
children
the
obligation
to
have
children
is
not
only
enjoined
in
the
scriptures
but
written
in
the
physical
social
and
moral
constitution
of
man
and
woman
this
law
is
rooted
in
the
unconscious
law
of
life
which
bids
us
perpetuate
our
kind
which
guards
over
the
conservation
of
life
love
looks
to
marriage
and
marriage
to
offspring
as
a
natural
sequence
any
entering
into
the
bond
of
marriage
with
the
resolved
purpose
of
avoiding
the
begetting
and
the
bearing
of
children
constitutes
a
union
which
accepts
lust
in
the
place
of
love
and
converts
the
honorable
estate
of
marriage
into
a
form
of
legalized
prostitution
an
earnest
writer
aptly
says
i
must
counsel
husbands
and
wives
to
cherish
the
hope
of
becoming
parents
and
to
let
their
hearts
stand
in
a
holy
attitude
in
this
respect
you
should
allow
neither
moderate

guernsey
says
the

brings
the

together

that
of

this
is
done
in
a
great
variety
of
ways
every
one
of
which
is
criminal
in
whatever
form
practiced
and
none
will

the

therefore
is

queen
victoria
held
up
as
a

excellence
in
this
respect
she
accepted
and
acknowledged
prince
albert
as
her
husband
and
gave
herself
to
him
as
his
wife
and
so
indeed
she
was
in
every
sense
of
the
term
although
a
queen
sitting
on
the
pinnacle
of
power
she
did
not
seek
to
avoid
the
pangs
the
dangers
or
inconveniences
of
bearing
children
by
her
own
personal
strength
her
twelve
children
were
brought
forth
and
her
own
sensitive
fibres
and
tissues
felt
the
suffering
she
nursed
caressed
and
loved

like
a

and
she
was
a
other
kings
and
queens
have
done
likewise
other
husbands
and
wives
high
in
power
wealth
and
fashion
have
done
and
are
still
doing
the
same
and
how
much
the
less
should
we
in
the
humbler
walks
of
life
obey
the
divine
command
fruitful
and
multiply
if
a
husband
truly
loves
his
wife
and
if
she
truly
loves
him
they
will
live
for
each
other
and
in
each
other
and
they
will
be
one
and
they
will
seek
to
do
right
in
every
particular
of
their
marital
relation
we
believe
that
every
thoughtful
man
and
considerate
husband
will
concede
that
motherhood
may
not
justly
or
properly
be
forced
upon
a
resisting
wife
that
many
wives
do
refuse
to
bear
children
no
person
can
deny
sometimes
the
reasons
assigned
are
unworthy
of
womanhood
base
and
ignoble
at
other
times
the
reasons
assigned
by
the
wife
are
worthy
of
the
most
thoughtful
consideration
but
whether
the
reasons
which
the
wife
entertains
are
honorable
or
dishonorable
correct
or
criminal
it
must
nevertheless
be
acknowledged
that
she
is
a
free
moral
agent
and
if
she
assumes
the
responsibility
of
declining
one
of
the
main
purposes
for
which
marriage
was
instituted
she
must
herself
bear
the
responsibility
to
designedly
inflict
conception
upon
an
unwilling
and
resisting
wife
the
husband
makes
himself
guilty
of
great
injustice
invades
the
personal
rights
of
his
wife
as
an
individual
and
is
guilty
of
a
great
wrong
where
a
wife
is
unwilling
to
become
a
mother
the
best
way
for
a
husband
to
move
her
mind
properly
in
this
matter
is
to
bring
her
under
the
influence
of
such
books
and
teachings
as
will
help
her
to
understand
her
duty
and
obligation
in
this
matter
help
her
to
see
that
this
is
one
of
the
great
purposes
for
which
marriage
is
instituted
and
that
where
childbearing
is
intentionally
and
persistently
evaded
it
becomes
a
crime
against
man
and
against
god
many
wives
are
not
willing
to
consent
to
become
mothers
because
they
are
unwilling
to
give
up
society
they
prefer
to
live
for
the
rounds
of
fashionable
life
with
others
there
is
a
dread
of
childbearing
this
is
not
so
common
in
brides
or
women
but
with
many
after
they
have
given
birth
to
one
child
they
are
unwilling
ever
to
consent
to
a
similar
struggle
had
these
young
wives
been
made
intelligent
by
their
mothers
and
been
properly
instructed
upon
these
subjects
before
marriage
and
lived
according
to
the
laws
of
hygiene
and
health
during
the
period
preceding
the
birth
of
their
child
their
experience
might
have
been
very
different
and
they
would
never
have
had
the
dread
which
comes
to
so
many
there
are
good
books
upon
this
subject
and
those
who
live
hygienically
and
properly
will
find
the
terrors
of
childbearing
greatly
mitigated
indeed
they
may
be
almost
wholly
alleviated
there
are
those
who
contend
that
childbearing
may
be
rendered
practically
painless
and
those
who
desire
information
upon
this
subject
would
do
well
to
read
the
book
entitled
maternity
without
suffering
which
is
worth
many
times
its
cost
a

by
the

there
are
other
women
who
dread
the
care
and
rearing
of
children
and
there
are
still
others
whose
aversion
to
childbearing
is
wholly
due
to
their
false
ideas
of
life
to
us
one
of
the
saddest
sights
is
a
woman
with
a
pronounced
who
is
unwilling
to
bear
children
or
if
she
is
the
mother
of
children
is
not
willing
to
care
for
them
but
thrusts
them
from
her
committing
them
wholly
to
nurses
and
attendants
and
then
allows
the
to
find
its
expression
in
petting
a
cat
or
mothering
a
dog
no
married
woman
should
refuse
to
become
a
mother
because
of
its
perils

go
to
show
that
more
unmarried
women
between
the
ages
of

than

greatest

attained
by
conformity
to
this
divine
purpose
among
the
greatest
sufferers
in
this
world
are
the
large
numbers
of
those
who
have
sought
to
defeat
the
purposes
of
god
and
have
brought
upon
themselves
untold
misery
obedience
brings
blessing
it
is
not
only
the
end
but
the
of
the
transgressor
that
is
hard
parenthood
is
also
essential
to
the
rounding
out
of
the
moral
nature
that
which
is
noblest
and
best
in
woman
nature
is
awakened
and
quickened
when
for
the
first
time
is
folded
to
her
breast
a
new
life
which
is
a
part
of
herself
the
child
will
teach
her
to
be
unselfish
to
live
for
the
happiness
and
of
another
its
government
and
discipline
will
awaken
in
her
mind
the
principles
which
she
desires
to
instil
into
the
mind
of
her
child
and
as
she
gathers
her
little
ones
about
her
tells
them
of
god
and
heaven
and
teaches
them
to
lisp
their
infant
prayer
her
religious
nature
will
attain
unto
a
perfection
and
beauty
which
would
not
be
possible
under
any
other
earthly
influence
the
thoughtful
and
judicious
wife
also
recognizes
the
fact
that
the
presence
of
children
in
the
home
will
exert
an
influence
over
the
father
which
will
refine
benefit
and
bless
as
no
other
influence
on
earth
can
the
little
ones
that
reach
out
their
hands
in
dependence
toward
him
will
inspire
him
to
energy
and
effort
in
a
higher
holier
and
nobler
way
than
could
ever
be
done
by
any
commercial
consideration
the
noblest
and
most
considerate
manifestations
of
the
father
nature
can
in
no
other
way
be
called
into
so
full
and
beautiful
an
exercise
as
by
the
presence
of
children
in
the
home
if
the
love
for
his
children
and
the
desire
for
their
and
blessing
do
not
teach
him
larger
lessons
of
than
he
has
ever
known
before
he
will
demonstrate
that
he
is
incapable
of
feeling
the
influence
of
the
most
potent
incentive
which
god
has
permitted
to
come
into
human
lives
but
the
children
will
have
an
effect
not
only
upon
the
parents
individually
but
they
will
bless
both
by
drawing
the
husband
and
wife
into
a
closer
bond
of
sympathy
and
affection
than
would
be
possible
under
any
other
conditions
it
has
aptly
been
said
that
children
are
golden
links
that
bind
the
husband
and
wife
in
a
bond
of
closest
endearment
they
also
serve
as
a
buffer
to
break
the
jars
of
family
life
these
little
ones
awaken
the
best
qualities
in
the
natures
of
both
parents
they
enlarge
and
round
out
those
qualities
which
would
otherwise
remain
dwarfed
and
prematurely
die
they
afford
a
purpose
in
life
for
the
father
and
mother
such
as
can
be
found
in
no
other
object
upon
earth
in
the
study
of
their
own
children
parents
have
an
opportunity
to
learn
human
nature
as
they
can
learn
it
nowhere
else
when
their
children
are
old
enough
they
will
criticise
suggest
and
often
help
the
parents
to
correct
faults
which
would
otherwise
go
unnoted
and
which
could
be
properly
criticised
by
no
one
else
it
is
the
absence
of
this
help
which
children
bring
into
the
home
which
oftentimes
renders
childless
married
people
more
faulty
than
others
who
have
the
advantage
of
such
help
in
times
of
trouble
and
trial
the
children
will
be
prepared
to
comfort
and
sustain
their
parents
in
times
of
sickness
they
will
come
with
their
sympathy
and
assistance
and
when
advancing
years
and
the
infirmities
of
age
come
they
will
be
prepared
to
comfort
and
sustain
their
parents
and
in
their
declining
years
afford
them
a
refuge
and
a
home
and
when
death
comes
they
will
shed
the
tear
of
sympathy
and
over
their
graves
will
plant
the
flowers
that
shall
bloom
in
beauty
and
fragrance
that
the
exists
in
the
hearts
of
infants
is
early
seen
in
the
desire
upon
the
part
of
little
girls
to
mother
their
dolls
whether
they
have
been
purchased
at
great
cost
or
are
made
of
a
few
old
clothes
rolled
up
into
the
shape
of
a
where
a
stranger
is
uncertain
about
the
sex
of
a
child
it
can
usually
be
pretty
certainly
determined
by
asking
whether
they
prefer
a
doll
or
a
horse
it
would
be
wrong
however
to
suppose
because
the
little
boy
manifests
the
preference
for
a
horse
that
therefore
he
will
never
be
interested
in
children
the
pleasures
and
satisfactions
of
parenthood
are
as
great
to
the
father
as
to
the
mother
and
while
there
is
a
difference
between
the
and
the
yet
because
of
the
terribly
perverting
influences
of
modern
society
the
desire
for
children
is
often
stronger
in
the
husband
than
in
the
wife
where
the
natures
of
both
are
as
god
intended
sterility
and
barrenness
would
be
alike
a
great
disappointment
for
either
the
desire
for
children
is
natural
both
to
men
and
women
and
in
the
home
as
in
universal
nature
unfruitfulness
and
barrenness
are
a
great
misfortune
about
one
marriage
in
eight
or
ten
is
usually
barren
of
children
in
the
animal
kingdom
and
among
insects
especially
an
abundance
of
food
is
indispensable
to
a
rapid
increase
of
numbers
by
reproduction
in
the
human
family
the
question
of
food
as
it
stands
related
to
the
question
of
reproduction
is
an
important
one
if
the
food
is
insufficient
either
in
quantity
or
quality
to
maintain
good
physical
conditions
or
if
it
is
too
abundant
or
too
rich
a
tendency
to
sterility
and
barrenness
is
alike
the
result
illustrations
are
not
wanting
of
persons
who
possessing
large
wealth
and
allowing
themselves
great
indulgence
in
eating
became
fat
and
corpulent
and
remained
childless
but
when
financial
reverses
came
their
corpulence
departed
with
their
wealth
and
they
became
the
parents
of
children
while
the
question
of
food
is
very
important
it
is
not
the
only
cause
of
barrenness
sterility
may
be
due
to
excessive
sexuality
in
the
marriage
relation
or
it
may
be
due
to
such
indulgence
of
the
husband
as
has
resulted
in
a
depleted
condition
of
the
reproductive
organs
sometimes
it
is
due
to
apathy
on
the
part
of
the
wife
and
at
other
times
although
less
frequent
it
may
be
the
result
upon
her
part
of
too
intense
pleasure
during
coition
it
may
also
be
due
to
abnormal
conditions
produced
by
tampering
with
the
reproductive
function
in
some
instances
there
is
a
lack
of
such
physiological
compatibility
as
is
necessary
to
result
in
conception
instances
are
not
wanting
where
barrenness
has
existed
and
the
subsequent
remarriage
of
both
parties
have
demonstrated
that
neither
were
personally
sterile
but
that
unitedly
they
were
physiologically
incompatible
barrenness
is
oftentimes
the
result
of
displacement
of
the
womb
or
other
unfavorable
conditions
in
the
female
it
would
be
wrong
however
to
suppose
that
the
difficulty
may
not
rest
wholly
with
the
husband
even
where
a
man
seems
in
good
bodily
vigor
and
enjoys
excellent
health
the
sperm
may
be
devoid
of
those
characteristics
which
are
essential
to
the
production
of
life
this
condition
can
only
be
determined
by
a
competent
physician
with
the
aid
of
the
microscope
and
other
means
it
is
also
asserted
by
reliable
medical
authority
that
miscarriage
may
take
place
so
early
after
conception
that
the
wife
may
never
suspect
the
real
condition
but
imagine
herself
sterile
the
cause
of
the
barrenness
of
not
a
few
women
is
clearly
traceable
to
the
fact
that
because
of
the
impure
life
of
the
husband
either
before
or
after
marriage
he
contracted
gonorrhœa
and
although
at
the
time
he
may
have
thought
it
a
small
matter
and
soon
regarded
himself
as
entirely
cured
this
terrible
disease
left
its
trace
behind
it
and
perhaps
two
or
three
years
afterward
when
he
entered
the
marriage
relation
he
imparted
the
hidden
remnants
of
this
disease
to
his
innocent
and
unsuspecting
wife
and
in
whom
perchance
the
real
disease
has
never
been
recognized
at
all
but
the
inflammation
which
it
caused
extended
from
the
vagina
to
the
womb
and
then
out
through
the
tubes
to
the
ovaries
and
the
delicate
organs
of
reproduction
were
so
injured
as
to
result
in
permanent
barrenness
the
cure
for
barrenness
is
found
in
remedying
the
cause
to
discover
what
that
cause
is
often
requires
the
consultation
and
advice
of
a
thoroughly
competent
physician
and
to
arrive
at
the
most
reliable
conclusion
a
physical
examination
of
the
wife
or
the
husband
or
of
both
may
be
necessary
where
no
means
have
been
used
to
prevent
conception
and
the
young
wife
has
remained
childless
for
a
period
of
three
years
there
is
adequate
ground
for
a
reasonable
fear
that
causes
exist
either
in
the
husband
or
in
the
wife
which
are
likely
to
result
in
permanent
sterility
and
then
no
time
should
be
lost
to
discover
and
remove
the
cause
or
causes
the
earlier
years
of
married
life
are
usually
more
fruitful
than
the
years
later
on
even
where
marriage
is
contracted
after
years
of
age
the
tendency
towards
sterility
is
easily
perceptible
marriage
either
at
too
early
or
too
late
a
period
tends
to
barrenness
upon
the

of

female
the
years
from
eighteen
to
are
likely
to
be
the
best
years
for
marriage
and
maternity
sometimes
there
is
barrenness
for
a
period
of
years
and
this
is
followed
by
a
period
of
quite
frequent
childbearing
barrenness
may
frequently
be
remedied
by
the
exercise
of
great
care
upon
the
part
of
both
the
husband
and
the
wife
in
the

a

questions
concerning
offspring
it
is
natural
that
parents
should
long
for
children
and
it
is
only
proper
that
those
who
are
barren
should
seek
by
all
judicious
and
proper
means
to
secure
fruitfulness
but
we
are
sorry
to
say
that
there
is
a
widely
prevalent
and
unnatural
desire
upon
the
part
of
many
wives
and
sometimes
of
their
husbands
also
to
evade
conception
this
desire
oftentimes
leads
these
unnatural
parents
to
seek
the
destruction
of
unborn
human
life
if
the
testimony
of
medical
authority
upon
this
subject
is
to
be
believed
this
mania
for
is
verily
the
terror
that
walketh
in
darkness
and
the
destruction
that
wasteth
at
noonday
it
is
the
duty
of
parents
to
protect
the
lives
of
their
children
and
the
mother
who
desires
or
even
consents
to
the
murder
of
the
infant
in
the
cradle
where
god
has
placed
it
preparatory
to
its
birth
is
as
truly
a
murderer
as
when
she
strangles
or
stabs
or
poisons
her
infant
in
the
cradle
in
which
she
has
placed
it
after
it
is
born
that
the
law
recognizes
the
gravity
of
this
crime
is
manifest
by
the
fact
that
in
nearly
all
the
states
of
the
union
this
crime
is
regarded
as
murder
and
punished
accordingly
in
some
states
if
the
mother
is
proven
guilty
the
penalty
is
death
and
in
nearly
all
the
states
all
who
participate
have
knowledge
of
or
assist
directly
or
indirectly
in
producing
such
a
result
are
punished
with
imprisonment
ranging
from
five
to
twenty
years
it
has
been
supposed
by
some
that
where
the
beginnings
of
life
are
destroyed
before
the
period
of
quickening
no
crime
is
committed
this
is
a
great
mistake
from
the
moment
that
the
spermatozoön
penetrates
the
ovum
and
unites
with
it
life
is
present
and
the
destruction
of
that
life
is
murder
the
proposition
is
a
very
simple
one
the
only
condition
upon
which
the
ovum
may
remain
in
the
womb
is
by
possessing
life
as
soon
as
it
becomes
dead
it
is
rejected
and
cast
out
if
impregnated
while
life
continues
in
it
during
its
period
of
development
if
nature
is
not
interfered
with
it
is
retained
and
nourished
because
it
has
life
the
facts
are
simple
enough
the
germ
is
either
dead
or
alive
if
dead
nature
casts
it
out
if
alive
nature
retains
it
if
nature
retains
it
and
it
is
destroyed
or
removed
by
artificial
means
the
person
or
persons
who
produce
such
a
result
are
guilty
of
murder
there
is
no
middle
ground
in
this
matter
pomeroy
in
his
excellent
book
entitled
ethics
of
marriage
aptly
says
she
who
obtains
a
miscarriage
at
the
earlier
months
of
pregnancy
feels
comparatively
virtuous
because
she
draws
the
line
at
this
is
moral
jugglery
and
ethical
what
evidence
is
there
of
soul
at
five
months
which
may
not
be
found
at
four
true
the
unborn
child
of
the
latter
age
does
not
appear
to
move
its
legs
and
arms
while
the
other
usually
does
is
the
spirit
situated
in
the
extremities
or
is
the
movement
of
a
muscle
evidence
of
a
soul
considered
from
the
low
plane
of
physical
life
only
what
reason
is
there
for
the
distinction
there
has
been
from
the
first
there
is
no
until
birth
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
creator
who
has
been
steadily
at
work
for
four
months
and
fifteen
days
on
one
of
the
most
delicate
and
complicated
pieces
in
his
whole
laboratory
and
has
made
no
mistake
thus
far
the
work
being
absolutely
perfect
as
far
as
carried
considers
it
of
little
or
no
consequence
but
of
the
utmost
importance
and
value
when
it
shall
have
been
in
his
hands
a
few
hours
longer
napheys
in
physical
life
of
woman
says
the
moment
of
a
new
life
commences
a
new
individual
exists
another
child
is
added
to
the
family
the
mother
who
deliberately
sets
about
to
destroy
this
life
either
by
want
of
care
or
by
taking
drugs
or
using
instruments
commits
as
great
a
crime
is
just
as
guilty
as
if
she
strangled
her
newborn
infant
or
as
if
she
snatched
from
her
own
breast
her
six
months
darling
and
dashed
out
its
brains
against
the
wall
the
blood
is
upon
her
head
and
as
surely
as
there
is
a
god
and
a
judgment
that
blood
will
be
required
of
her
the
crime
she
commits
is
the
slaughter
of
a
speechless
helpless
being
whom
it
is
her
duty
beyond
all
things
else
to
cherish
and
preserve
there
is
no
division
of
opinion
upon
this
subject
the
world
may
hold
up
its
hands
in
holy
horror
at
the
crime
of
herod
but
his
crime
is
being
perpetrated
in
thousands
of
homes
by
the
slaughter
of
the
innocents
at
the
hands
of
their
own
mothers
pomeroy
says
we
meet
in
our
practice
women
who
would
hesitate
to
harm
a
fly
but
who
admit
to
having
destroyed
a
half
dozen
or
more
of
their
unborn
children
speaking
of
it
as
they
would
of
the
drowning
of
superfluous
kittens
how
are
these
thoughtless
to
confront
the
souls
of
their
unborn
children
on
the
day
of
judgment
what
of
the
declaration
of
scripture
ye
know
that
no
murderer
hath
eternal
life
abiding
in
him
while
this
passage
of
scripture
does
not
say
that
even
a
murderer
may
not
be
saved
yet
it
does
say
that
one
who
commits
murder
is
unsaved
and
that
salvation
is
not
possible
to
him
or
her
until
they
have
sincerely
repented
the
results
of
abortion
are
not
only
future
and
spiritual
but
they
are
present
and
affect
serious
temporal
and
physical
results
napheys
says
if
they
have
no
feeling
for
the
fruit
of
their
womb
if
maternal
sentiment
is
so
calloused
in
their
breasts
let
them
know
that
such
produced
abortions
are
the
constant
cause
of
violent
and
dangerous
womb
diseases
and
frequently
of
early
death
that
they
bring
on
mental
weakness
and
often
insanity
that
they
are
the
most
certain
means
to
destroy
domestic
happiness
which
can
be
adopted
better
far
better
bear
a
child
every
year
for
twenty
years
than
to
resort
to
such
a
wicked
and
injurious
step
better
to
die
if
need
be
in
the
pangs
of
childbirth
than
to
live
with
such
a
weight
of
sin
on
the
conscience
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
many
women
are
rendered
incurable
invalids
by
the
violence
which
they
do
to
nature
by
interrupting
its
work
destroying
the
growing
life
and
causing
its
expulsion
in
an
unnatural
way
pomeroy
aptly
says
go
into
the
orchard
where
there
are
ripe
apples
and
others
but
half
grown
try
to
pluck
one
of
the
latter
you
pull
but
it
does
not
come
you
twist
this
way
and
that
way
and
finally
you
secure
a
bruised
apple
with
a
torn
and
mutilated
stem
and
you
leave
behind
a
branch
which
bears
unmistakable
evidence
of
a
violent
and
unnatural
act
turn
now
to
the
apples
that
are
fully
ripe
you
put
out
your
hand
to
take
one
and
as
you
touch
it
it
falls
gently
and
willingly
into
your
open
palm
if
you
now
examine
the
stem
and
the
branch
from
which
it
came
you
find
no
marks
of
violence
on
the
contrary
both
will
clearly
show
that
nature
had
prepared
for
the
separation
the
two
great
dangers
of
childbearing
are
hemorrhage
and
fever
the
first
is
caused
directly
and
the
second
often
indirectly
by
one
and
the
same
thing
the
failure
of
the
torn
to
close
properly
at
the
time
of
separation
between
mother
and
child
by
the
time
the
fruit
is
fully
ripe
nature
has
so
well
arranged
for
this
matter
that
the
danger
is
small
but
at
an
earlier
period
it
is
very
considerable
this
attempt
upon
the
part
of
parents
to
interfere
with
the
order
of
nature
has
not
only
its
terrible
physical
results
for
those
who
seek
its
perpetration
but
it
heaps
upon
the
helpless
unborn
child
terrible
consequences
from
which
it
is
powerless
to
escape
the
attempt
to
destroy
life
is
oftentimes
a
double
failure
in
spite
of
their
murderous
efforts
children
are
oftentimes
born
to
such
parents
under
circumstances
which
entail
the
most
terrible
and
lifelong
penalties
children
that
might
have
been
lovable
in
temper
companionable
in
disposition
healthy
and
happy
are
born
nervous
fretful
and
and
because
they
were
unwanted
before
they
were
born
the
mother
inflicts
upon
them
a
disposition
which
causes
her
ever
after
to
wish
they
never
had
been
born
something
of
what
this
result
is
will
appear
from
a
paragraph
taken
from
an
account
by
helen
thomas
in
the
mothers
journal
entitled
unwanted
in
which
she
thus
narrates
a
visit
to
a
friend
i
found
my
friend
half
sick
and
extremely
nervous
from
lack
of
sleep
caused
by
her
crying
baby
but
the
child
looked
well
and
the
young
mother
assured
me
that
it
was
constitutionally
restless
and
out
of
sorts
she
also
said
that
she
had
lost
more
sleep
since
his
advent
five
months
previous
than
with
all
her
other
children
there
are
three
of
them
combined
after
i
had
queried
and
wondered
as
to
the
why
of
it
for
a
time
the
mother
with
tears
in
her
eyes
looked
down
at
the
little
upturned
face
of
the
one
cradled
in
her
arms
and
said
is
all
mother
fault
darling
she
felt
that
her
hands
and
heart
were
so
full
she
had
no
room
for
you
and
then
looking
me
full
in
the
face
she
added
remorsefully
he
is
my
only
unwanted
child
and
so
the
dear
little
innocent
suffers
continually
for
my
rebellious
spirit
prior
to
his
birth
he
seems
restless
and
unhappy
all
the
time
not
at
all
like
my
other
babies
who
found
a
welcome
awaiting
them
and
i
realize
now
the
mistake
i
made
in
rebelling
as
i
did
during
those
wearisome
months
which
i
had
planned
so
full
of
things
which
had
to
be
put
aside
and
i
am
being
punished
for
it
too
but
i
did
not
dream
that
by
so
doing
i
should
bring
suffering
on
my
unborn
child
as
well
as
on
myself
terrible
as
this
picture
may
be
there
is
another
thought
which
is
still
more
terrible
when
we
remember
that
the
mental
condition
of
the
mother
during
the
period
of
gestation
stamps
itself
upon
the
character
of
the
child
what
must
be
the
character
of
a
child
who
is
born
of
a
murderess
one
who
has
either
desired
planned
for
or
possibly
undertaken
and
failed
in
the
effort
to
murder
her
unborn
child
how
many
of
the
murderers
of
have
inherited
from
their
own
mothers
the
predisposition
to
destroy
human
life
there
is
but
little
doubt
that
if
the
veil
could
be
thrown
off
and
the
influence
disclosed
which
molded
the
character
and
shaped
the
destiny
of
many
of
the
children
who
are
arraigned
in
the
courts
for
the
awful
crime
of
murder
who
seem
possessed
of
an
otherwise
unaccountable
predisposition
to
destroy
human
life
the
terrible
revelation
would
be
made
that
during
the
period
while
their
body
was
being
formed
and
bent
was
being
given
to
their
character
prior
to
their
birth
their
mother
was
contemplating
murder
and
imparted
this
disposition
to
her
own
offspring
such
thoughts
not
only
mold
the
character
of
the
unborn
child
but
they
also
affect
the
character
of
the
parents
themselves
the
crime
of
must
haunt
them
and
even
if
they
do
not
suffer
from
the
lashings
of
conscience
the
moral
character
suffers
irreparable
damage
but
few
persons
are
aware
of
the
grave
dangers
which
threaten
health
and
even
life
when
an
abortion
is
performed
they
are
apt
to
think
that
it
occasions
only
temporary
inconvenience
from
which
they
may
recover
in
a
few
days
but
all
this
is
a
very
grave
mistake
where
accidental
or
unintentional
miscarriage
occurs
it
is
important
both
for
the
wife
and
for
the
husband
to
know
that
quite
as
much
care
needs
to
be
exercised
and
oftentimes
for
even
as
long
a
period
as
for
convalescence
after
confinement
a
period
of
strict
separation
between
husband
and
wife
should
be
observed
for
a
period
of
from
six
weeks
to
three
months
according
to
circumstances
a
failure
to
observe
these
necessities
often
results
in
serious
and
sometimes
permanent
disability
upon
the
part
of
the
wife
the
influences
which
prepare
and
pave
the
way
in
the
minds
of
young
women
for
the
awful
crime
of
are
not
difficult
to
find
one
writer
says
the
real
beginning
is
in
early
life
when
young
people
are
taught
directly
or
by
implication
that
reproduction
is
a
matter
concerning
which
speech
is
indelicate
of
which
it
is
proper
even
to
feel
ashamed
as
they
grow
older
and
the
period
of
marriage
draws
near
they
learn
to
look
upon
parenthood
as
a
responsibility
and
a
burden
which
they
may
properly
avoid
if
possible
parents
are
to
blame
for
the
total
absence
during
the
education
of
their
daughters
of
proper
instruction
upon
this
subject
in
the
schools
for
the
education
of
young
women
the
course
of
study
which
has
been
especially
arranged
for
the
intellectual
training
and
equipment
of
young
men
has
been
followed
without
being
adapted
to
the
special
necessities
of
intelligent
young
women
they
are
taught
many
things
which
may
serve
a
good
purpose
in
securing
mental
discipline
but
which
are
in
every
other
respect
impracticable
and
so
far
as
the
great
purposes
of
their
life
are
concerned
wholly
useless
all
the
subjects
which
are
best
calculated
to
fit
them
for
their
intended
position
of
wife
and
mother
are
studiously
avoided
they
are
kept
in
profound
ignorance
on
all
subjects
of
special
physiology
and
the
question
of
maternity
dare
not
so
much
as
be
mentioned
by
the
professors
in
the
what
adds
to
this
condition
is
the
sad
fact
that
parents
do
not
supplement
by
personal
instruction
this
lack
of
teaching
in
the
school
hundreds
of
young
women
are
married
who
are
so
stupid
as
never
to
have
asked
where
children
come
from
have
no
idea
of
the
marital
relation
and
the
legitimate
purpose
for
which
god
instituted
the
relation
when
conception
takes
place
they
do
not
know
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
or
prepare
for
the
event
which
could
be
robbed
of
its
terrors
by
intelligence
the
birth
of
their
first
child
is
attended
with
such
anguish
and
agony
that
forever
after
the
marital
relation
becomes
to
them
one
of
great
dread
and
to
escape
the
condition
which
is
so
full
of
terror
to
them
they
resort
to
the
destruction
of
unborn
human
life
to
correct
this
great
wrong
the
first
and
most
essential
step
is
the
widespread
dissemination
of
intelligence
upon
this
subject
marriage
needs
to
be
lifted
into
the
light
of
a
sacred
and
divine
institution
the
tenderest
and
most
sacred
relations
of
human
life
need
to
be
preserved
in
their
purity
so
that
parents
may
speak
of
these
relations
without
shame
and
blushing
young
women
of
mature
years
should
be
made
familiar
with
the
physiological
conditions
which
attend
conception
and
maternity
and
they
need
to
know
that
from
the
moment
of
conception
life
exists
in
the
embryo
and
that
from
the
moment
the
spermatozoön
enters
and
assimilates
with
the
ovum
a
separate
individual
life
is
really
begun
and
that
she
is
at
that
very
moment
the
mother
of
this
life
within
her
as
truly
as
when
in
the
later
months
she
feels
the
quickening
within
her
or
after
its
birth
experiences
the
joy
of
a
mother
who
clasps
her
newborn
infant
in
her
arms
but
the
crime
of
abortion
does
not
rest
wholly
with
the
mothers
a
large
part
of
the
guilt
also
belongs
to
the
fathers
we
may
warn
the
wives
against
the
terrible
sin
and
awful
physical
consequences
of
abortion
but
so
long
as
husbands
are
unwilling
to
govern
their
passions
or
to
regulate
their
marital
relations
in
harmony
with
the
teachings
of
scripture
but
insist
upon
unlimited
the
evils
can
not
be
wholly
corrected
husbands
need
to
be
taught
to
look
at
the
question
from
the
wife
standpoint
the
wrong
is
not
all
upon
one
side
in
a
meeting
of
women
only
after
an
address
by
a
physician
upon
these
subjects
a
woman
rose
and
said
substantially
as
follows
after
i
was
married
two
years
i
became
the
mother
of
a
puny
sickly
baby
it
required
incessant
care
and
watching
to
keep
it
alive
when
it
was
only
seven
months
old
to
my
surprise
astonishment
and
horror
i
felt
quickening
and
for
the
first
time
i
knew
i
was
pregnant
again
i
was
abased
humiliated
the
sense
of
degradation
that
filled
my
soul
can
not
be
described
what
had
been
done
the
babe
that
was
born
and
the
babe
that
was
unborn
were
both
to
be
robbed
of
their
just
inheritance
in
tears
and
shame
i
told
my
mother
but
she
said
child
why
should
you
grieve
and
go
on
as
you
do
do
you
know
that
your
children
are
legitimate
my
whole
being
rose
in
rebellion
i
stamped
my
foot
and
almost
screamed
my
husband
is
the
father
of
my
children
they
are
not
legitimate
no
laws
no
priestly
rites
can
make
an
act
legitimate
that
deprives
innocent
children
of
their
right
to
life
and
health
and
then
with
sobs
and
moans
reaction
came
and
i
fainted
in
my
mother
arms
what
was
the
sequel
two
years
later
both
of
these
children
after
a
brief
existence
were
lying
side
by
side
in
the
city
of
the
dead
and
until
my
husband
and
i
learned
the
great
laws
which
god
has
written
deep
in
our
being
we
were
not
able
to
have
children
that
could
live
the
following
somewhat
lengthy
but
impressive
quotation
is
from
chastity
by
doctor
dio
lewis
before
we
married
i
informed
my
husband
of
my
dread
of
having
children
i
told
him
i
was
not
prepared
to
meet
the
sufferings
and
responsibilities
of
maternity
he
entered
into
an
arrangement
to
prevent
it
for
a
specified
time
this
agreement
was
disregarded
after
the
legal
form
was
over
and
he
felt
he
could
now
indulge
his
passion
without
loss
of
reputation
and
under
legal
and
religious
sanctions
he
insisted
on
the
surrender
of
my
person
to
his
will
he
violated
the
promise
at
the
beginning
of
our
united
life
that
fatal
bridal
night
it
has
left
a
cloud
on
my
soul
and
on
my
home
that
can
never
pass
away
on
earth
i
can
never
forget
it
it
sealed
the
doom
of
our
union
as
it
has
done
of
thousands
he
was
in
feeble
health
so
was
i
and
both
of
us
mentally
depressed
but
the
sickly
germ
was
implanted
and
conception
took
place
we
were
poor
and
destitute
having
made
no
preparations
for
a
home
ourselves
and
child
i
was
a
stricken
woman
in
september
following
we
came
to
and
settled
in
a
new
country
in
the
march
following
my
child
developed
under
a
heart
throbbing
with
dread
and
anguish
at
the
thought
of
its
existence
was
born
after
three
months
struggle
i
became
reconciled
to
my
first
unwelcome
child
but
the
impress
of
my
impatience
and
hostility
to
its
existence
previous
to
its
birth
was
on
my
child
never
to
be
effaced
and
to
this
hour
that
child
is
the
victim
or
an
undesired
maternity
in
one
year
i
found
i
was
to
be
again
a
mother
i
was
in
a
state
of
frightful
despair
my
was
sickly
and
very
troublesome
how
could
it
be
otherwise
needing
constant
care
and
nursing
my
husband
chopped
wood
for
our
support
of
the
injustice
of
bringing
children
into
the
world
to
struggle
with
poverty
and
misery
i
was
then
as
sensible
as
now
i
was
in
despair
i
felt
that
death
would
be
preferable
to
maternity
under
such
circumstances
a
desire
and
a
determination
to
get
rid
of
my
child
entered
into
my
heart
i
consulted
a
lady
friend
and
by
her
persuasion
and
assistance
killed
it
within
less
than
a
year
maternity
was
again
imposed
upon
me
with
no
better
prospect
of
doing
justice
to
my
child
it
was
a
most
painful
conviction
to
me
i
felt
that
i
could
not
have
another
child
at
that
time
all
seemed
dark
as
death
i
had
begged
and
prayed
to
be
spared
this
trial
again
until
i
was
prepared
to
accept
it
joyfully
but
my
husband
insisted
upon
his
gratification
without
regard
to
my
wishes
and
condition
i
consulted
a
physician
and
told
him
of
my
unhappy
state
of
mind
and
my
aversion
to
having
another
child
for
the
present
he
was
ready
with
his
logic
his
medicines
and
instruments
and
told
me
how
to
destroy
it
after
experimenting
on
myself
three
months
i
was
successful
i
killed
my
child
about
five
months
after
conception
a
few
months
after
this
maternity
was
again
forced
upon
me
to
my
grief
and
anguish
i
determined
again
on
my
child
destruction
but
my
courage
failed
as
i
came
to
the
practical
deed
my
health
and
life
were
in
jeopardy
for
my
living
child
sake
i
wished
to
live
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
the
best
i
could
for
my
unborn
babe
whose
existence
seemed
so
unnatural
and
repulsive
i
knew
its
young
life
would
be
deeply
and
lastingly
affected
by
my
mental
and
physical
condition
i
became
in
a
measure
reconciled
to
my
dark
fate
and
was
as
resigned
and
happy
as
i
could
be
under
the
circumstances
i
had
just
such
a
child
as
i
had
every
reason
to
expect
i
could
do
no
justice
to
it
how
could
i
soon
after
the
birth
of
my
child
my
husband
insisted
on
his
accustomed
injustice
without
any
wish
of
my
own
maternity
was
again
forced
upon
me
i
dared
not
attempt
to
get
rid
of
the
child
abortion
seemed
so
cruel
so
inhuman
unnatural
and
repulsive
i
resolved
again
for
my
child
sake
to
do
the
best
i
could
for
it
though
i
could
not
joyfully
welcome
i
resolved
quietly
to
endure
its
existence
after
the
birth
of
this
child
i
felt
that
i
could
have
no
more
to
share
our
poverty
and
to
suffer
the
wrongs
and
trials
of
an
unwelcome
existence
i
felt
that
i
would
rather
die
at
once
and
thus
end
my
life
and
my
power
to
be
a
mother
together
my
husband
cast
the
entire
care
of
the
family
on
me
i
had
scarcely
one
hour
to
devote
to
my
children
my
husband
still
insisted
on
his
gratification
i
was
the
veriest
slave
alive
life
had
lost
its
charms
the
grave
seemed
my
only
refuge
and
death
my
only
friend
in
this
state
known
as
it
was
to
my
husband
he
thrust
maternity
upon
me
twice
i
employed
a
doctor
to
kill
my
child
and
in
the
destruction
of
it
in
what
should
have
been
the
vigor
of
my
life
ended
my
power
to
be
a
mother
i
was
shorn
of
the
brightest
jewel
of
my
womanhood
i
suffered
as
woman
alone
can
suffer
not
only
in
body
but
in
bitter
remorse
and
anguish
of
soul
all
this
i
passed
through
under
the
terrible
withering
consciousness
that
it
was
all
done
and
suffered
solely
that
the
passion
of
my
husband
might
have
a
momentary
indulgence
yet
such
had
been
my
false
religious
and
social
education
that
in
submitting
my
person
to
his
passion
i
did
it
in
the
honest
conviction
that
in
marriage
my
body
became
the
property
of
my
husband
he
said
so
all
women
to
whom
i
applied
for
counsel
said
it
was
my
duty
to
submit
that
husbands
expected
it
had
a
right
to
it
and
must
have
this
indulgence
whenever
they
were
excited
or
suffer
and
that
in
this
way
alone
could
wives
retain
the
love
of
their
husbands
i
had
no
alternative
but
silent
suffering
submission
to
his
passion
and
then
procure
abortion
or
leave
him
and
thus
resign
my
children
to
the
tender
mercies
of
one
with
whom
it
seemed
i
could
not
live
myself
abortion
was
most
repulsive
to
every
feeling
of
my
nature
and
at
times
rendered
me
an
object
of
loathing
to
myself
when
my
was
three
months
old
i
had
a
desperate
struggle
for
personal
liberty
my
husband
insisted
on
his
right
to
subject
my
person
to
his
passion
before
my
babe
was
two
months
old
i
saw
his
conduct
then
in
all
its
degrading
and
loathing
injustice
i
pleaded
with
tears
and
anguish
for
my
own
and
my
child
sake
to
be
spared
and
had
it
not
been
for
my
helpless
child
i
should
have
ended
the
struggle
by
bolting
my
legal
bonds
for
its
sake
i
submitted
to
that
outrage
and
my
own
conscious
degradation
for
its
sake
i
concluded
to
take
my
chance
in
the
world
with
other
wives
and
mothers
who
as
they
assured
me
and
as
i
then
knew
were
all
around
me
subjected
to
like
outrages
and
driven
to
the
degrading
practice
of
abortion
but
even
then
i
saw
and
argued
the
justice
of
my
personal
rights
in
regard
to
maternity
and
the
relation
that
leads
to
it
as
strongly
as
you
do
now
i
saw
it
all
as
clearly
as
you
do
i
was
then
amid
all
the
degrading
influences
that
crushed
me
true
and
just
to
my
womanly
intuitions
i
insisted
on
my
right
to
say
when
and
under
what
circumstances
i
would
accept
of
him
the
office
of
maternity
and
become
the
mother
of
his
child
i
insisted
that
it
was
for
me
to
say
when
and
how
often
i
should
subject
myself
to
the
liability
of
becoming
a
mother
but
he
became
angry
with
me
claimed
ownership
over
me
insisted
that
i
as
a
wife
was
to
submit
to
my
husband
all
threatened
to
leave
me
and
my
children
and
declared
i
was
not
fit
to
be
a
wife
fearing
some
fatal
consequences
to
my
child
or
to
myself
being
alone
destitute
and
far
from
helpful
friends
in
the
far
west
and
fearing
that
my
little
one
would
be
left
to
want
i
stifled
all
expression
of
my
honest
convictions
and
ever
after
kept
my
aversion
and
painful
struggles
in
my
own
bosom
in
every
respect
as
far
as
passional
relations
between
myself
and
my
husband
are
concerned
i
have
ever
felt
myself
to
be
a
miserable
and
abject
woman
i
now
see
and
feel
it
most
deeply
and
painfully
if
i
was
with
a
child
in
my
arms
i
was
in
constant
dread
of
all
personal
contact
with
my
husband
lest
i
should
have
a
new
maternity
thrust
upon
me
and
be
obliged
to
wean
one
child
before
its
time
to
give
place
to
another
in
my
misery
i
have
often
cried
out
god
is
there
no
way
out
of
this
loathsome
bondage
it
was
not
want
of
kindly
feelings
toward
my
husband
that
induced
this
state
of
mind
for
i
could
and
did
endure
every
privation
and
want
without
an
unkindly
feeling
or
word
and
even
cheerfully
for
his
sake
but
every
feeling
of
my
soul
did
then
does
now
and
ever
must
protest
against
the
cruel
and
loathsome
injustice
of
husbands
toward
their
wives
manifested
in
imposing
on
them
a
maternity
uncalled
for
by
their
own
nature
and
most
repulsive
to
it
and
whose
sufferings
and
responsibilities
they
are
unprepared
and
unwilling
to
meet
while
we
would
not
for
a
moment
sanction
the
crime
which
this
mother
perpetrated
yet
we
are
not
prepared
to
say
that
she
was
the
sole
author
of
the
crime
every
thoughtful
man
must
admit
that
her
husband
was
unreasonable
unwilling
to
govern
his
passion
cruel
and
unjust
to
his
wife
and
in
his
beastliness
measurably
drove
her
to
the
commission
of
the
awful
crime
of
which
she
was
guilty
the
proper
relation
of
husband
and
wife
to
the
question
of
parenthood
can
never
be
properly
and
satisfactorily
adjusted
so
long
as
either
of
these
parties
occupy
extreme
positions
upon
this
question
it
is
absolutely
wrong
for
the
wife
to
take
the
position
that
she
is
to
be
wholly
delivered
from
maternity
and
the
care
of
children
and
it
is
equally
wrong
for
the
husband
to
assume
that
the
wife
is
created
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
bear
children
in
as
rapid
succession
as
nature
renders
conception
possible
upon
the
one
hand
it
is
the
duty
of
the
wife
to
arrange
her
thought
and
life
with
reference
to
maternity
and
the
bearing
of
such
a
number
of
children
as
can
be
brought
into
the
world
in
the
highest
state
of
physical
intellectual
and
moral
equipment
upon
the
other
hand
the
husband
is
to
regard
himself
under
obligation
to
practice
such
personal
and
to
bear
such
disadvantages
as
are
incident
to
the
greatest
fidelity
of
the
wife
in
her
duties
while
the
body
and
character
of
her
child
are
being
formed
within
her
and
while
it
is
being
nursed
nurtured
and
cared
for
after
its
birth
it
is
the
grossest
of
insults
not
only
to
woman
but
to
her
maker
to
assert
that
woman
was
created
solely
for
reproduction
it
is
proper
for
a
man
in
the
discharge
of
certain
duties
and
in
the
attainment
of
certain
laudable
ends
to
decline
to
marry
and
resolve
to
maintain
a
pure
and
celibate
life
throughout
his
entire
existence
and
it
is
equally
right
and
even
commendable
for
a
woman
with
similar
purposes
and
aims
to
decline
marriage
in
order
that
she
may
devote
herself
with
greater
efficiency
and
success
to
some
effort
to
elevate
and
bless
mankind
if
those
ends
could
not
be
successfully
accomplished
in
connection
with
the
proper
discharge
of
her
duties
as
wife
and
mother
but
when
men
and
women
do
marry
they
greatly
mistake
the
object
of
this
divine
institution
if
they
suppose
that
it
was
instituted
solely
for
the
purpose
of
producing
the
largest
possible
number
of
children
if
they
make
rather
than
the
great
purpose
marriage
was
instituted
for
the
highest
good
of
the
parents
it
was
instituted
for
the
attainment
of
their
best
health
and
the
largest
intellectual
and
moral
equipment
their
lives
are
to
be
shaped
for
the
acquisition
of
the
largest
and
best
attainments
unless
they
attain
the
best
physical
intellectual
and
moral
developments
they
can
not
transmit
these
valuable
qualities
to
their
children
the
children
can
not
inherit
from
the
parents
what
the
parents
do
not
possess
parents
should
seek
to
raise
up
not
the
largest
possible
number
without
regard
to
whether
they
are
good
bad
or
indifferent
but
there
is
no
objection
to
their
raising
up
the
largest
number
consistent
with
the
best
possible
equipment
one
man
is
worth
an
innumerable
number
of
monkeys
and
we
should
seek
to
raise
up
not
an
innumerable
horde
of
inferior
beings
but
only
so
large
a
number
as
is
consistent
with
a
sincere
purpose
not
to
evade
the
responsibilities
and
duties
of
parenthood
and
with
an
earnest
effort
to
raise
up
a
race
of
superior
men
and
women
there
should
be
no
consenting
to
deterioration
but
a
sincere
desire
and
effort
for
the
raising
up
of
a
new
generation
that
shall
be
an
advance
upon
all
the
generations
that
have
preceded
by
what
we
have
said
it
will
be
manifest
that
there
is
a
culpable
and
criminal
limitation
of
offspring
and
there
is
also
a
reasonable
and
right
regulation
of
the
marital
relation
and
a
limiting
of
offspring
a
designed
and
deliberate
purpose
to
be
with
a
view
to
intelligent
purposed
parenthood
there
are
times
when
it
is
positively
wrong
to
beget
and
bring
forth
children
this
is
the
case
when
there
is
such
physical
debility
upon
either
the
part
of
the
husband
or
the
wife
as
would
render
them
incapable
of
transmitting
or
bearing
healthy
children
when
overburdened
or
broken
down
by
excessive
childbearing
nothing
but
puny
sickly
offspring
could
reasonably
be
expected
when
the
children
are
coming
so
rapidly
that
they
interfere
with
each
nutrition
and
imperil
the
mother
health
or
when
the
mother
is
naturally
so
constituted
that
childbearing
imperils
her
life
these
and
other
equally
weighty
reasons
are
a
sufficient
justification
for
a
careful
study
of
duty
and
obligation
in
the
matter
of
and
the
limitation
or
even
restriction
of
childbearing
by
right
and
proper
methods
it
is
important
however
to
say
that
married
persons
should
never
decide
against
childbearing
or
even
in
favor
of
a
very
restricted
parenthood
without
the
gravest
considerations
nor
is
their
own
thought
in
the
matter
always
sufficient
to
arrive
at
a
wise
and
righteous
conclusion
their
own
judgment
should
always
be
supplemented
by
the
counsel
and
advice
of
a
and
thoroughly
conscientious
christian
physician
where
difficulties
do
exist
a
conscientious
consideration
of
them
may
often
enable
the
parties
to
remove
every
barrier
and
secure
the
most
blessed
and
gratifying
results
what
we
have
intimated
is
aptly
illustrated
in
the
following
instance
given
by
pomeroy
in
the
ethics
of
marriage
a
resulted
in
the
union
of
two
persons
who
were
of
nervous
temperament
and
poor
physique
many
and
small
means
beside
this
the
wife
was
suffering
from
a
difficulty
which
made
maternity
undesirable
and
impossible
under
the
circumstances
they
questioned
whether
indefinite
postponement
of
parenthood
were
not
proper
and
in
fact
clearly
indicated
they
considered
the
matter
carefully
took
the
benefit
of
medical
advice
and
finally
decided
that
their
only
honorable
and
safe
course
would
be
that
they
should
have
a
family
of
healthy
children
as
its
objective
point
the
wife
was
placed
under
medical
treatment
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
was
in
physical
condition
safely
to
undertake
maternity
recognizing
their
limitations
and
disadvantages
from
the
outset
the
pair
determined
to
make
every
possible
effort
to
give
their
children
as
good
a
birth
as
might
be
under
the
circumstances
each
tried
to
cultivate
health
and
strength
of
mind
and
body
the
laws
of
heredity
were
studied
conscientious
care
was
taken
that
the
mother
might
have
bright
and
cheery
objects
about
her
and
loving
thoughts
in
her
mind
during
the
period
when
each
child
gained
all
its
influence
from
the
outside
world
through
her
each
child
was
also
during
this
period
a
subject
of
prayer
that
the
holy
spirit
might
enter
into
its
developing
life
and
cause
it
to
be
so
generated
that
the
afterwork
of
regeneration
might
if
possible
follow
as
the
day
follows
the
dawn
it
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
this
course
would
in
every
case
be
followed
by
results
as
marked
as
were
those
of
this
instance
but
in
this
family
the
children
have
proved
to
be
if
not
all
that
could
be
desired
at
least
much
better
than
would
have
been
expected
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
they
were
symmetrical
sound
in
body
equable
in
temperament
and
affectionate
towards
the
parents
and
each
other
they
have
never
been
more
than
half
the
trouble
and
care
that
children
ordinarily
are
although
possessed
of
high
spirit
and
a
keen
sense
of
justice
what
may
develop
as
they
arrive
at
maturity
no
one
can
tell
but
it
is
certain
that
they
now
bear
the
impress
of
prenatal
love
and
care
and
a
good
birth
this
cost
the
parents
some
effort
and
but
they
have
been
repaid
fourfold
in
the
ease
with
which
the
nursery
has
been
managed
moreover
little
differences
of
taste
and
opinion
were
laid
on
the
altar
of
sacrifice
to
the
interests
of
the
children
who
should
be
born
to
them
and
each
as
it
joined
in
the
family
circle
brought
new
degrees
of
harmony
and
joy
i
have
repeatedly
heard
the
father
of
that
family
declare
that
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
himself
a
dollar
poorer
than
he
would
have
been
if
no
children
had
come
to
claim
his
care
just
what
might
have
been
in
that
case
it
is
impossible
to
tell
but
it
is
certain
that
many
a
childless
marriage
which
began
under
apparently
happier
auspices
than
this
one
ended
in
misery
and
divorce
but
the
question
arises
where
it
is
found
necessary
to
limit
the
number
of
offspring
how
shall
it
be
properly
done
there
are
those
who
seem
to
think
that
medical
science
has
some
way
by
which
to
grant
unrestricted
sexual
indulgence
and
yet
avoid
the
results
which
nature
intended
pomeroy
says
it
is
surprising
to
what
an
extent
the
laity
believe
that
medical
science
knows
how
to
control
the
birthrate
just
here
let
me
say
that
i
know
of
but
one
prescription
which
is
both
safe
and
sure
namely
the
sexes
shall
remain
so
thoroughly
do
i
believe
this
to
be
a
secret
which
nature
has
kept
to
herself
that
i
should
be
inclined
to
question
the
ability
or
the
honesty
of
any
one
professing
to
understand
it
so
as
to
be
able
safely
and
surely
to
regulate
the
matter
of
reproduction
for
those
living
in
wedlock
because
of
the
moral
issues
physical
consequences
and
terrible
results
which
cluster
about
this
question
one
of
the
most
delicate
with
which
we
have
to
deal
we
have
made
a
most
careful
examination
of
this
entire
subject
we
have
read
a
great
deal
more
than
has
been
pleasant
to
our
contemplation
but
we
have
been
compelled
to
return
after
each
new
investigation
to
the
conclusion
which
is
held
by
all
reputable
physicians
that
the
only
safe
and
sure
way
is
for
husband
and
wife
to
remain
strictly
apart
there
are
methods
which
are
sometimes
suggested
by
even
physicians
to
those
who
desire
to
escape
the
results
of
the
marital
relation
but
when
pressed
for
the
expression
of
a
candid
and
honest
conviction
these
same
physicians
are
always
compelled
to
admit
that
for
absolute
safety
there
is
but
one
provision
these
various
methods
are
not
only
unsatisfactory
and
unavailing
but
are
ruinous
in
their
effects
upon
the
individuals
who
practice
them
in
some
instances
nature
does
not
visit
her
penalties
immediately
but
eventually
the
old
declaration
proves
true
that
although
justice
travels
with
a
sore
foot
it
is
sure
to
overtake
the
transgressor
where
married
people
are
willing
to
live
according
to
the
laws
which
are
written
deep
in
our
nature
they
find
what
kellogg
has
said
is
true
there
would
be
less
sexual
enjoyment
but
more
elevated
joy
there
would
be
less
animal
love
but
more
spiritual
communion
less
gross
more
pure
less
development
of
the
animal
and
more
fruitful
soil
for
the
cultivation
of
virtue
holiness
and
all
the
christian
graces
an
entire
renunciation
of
all
conjugal
privileges
is
however
only
perfectly
just
and
proper
when
it
meets
with
the
mutual
consent
of
both
husband
and
wife
concerning
such
a
rigid
course
napheys
in
transmission
of
life
says
the
objection
nowadays
urged
against
it
is
that
it
is
too
severe
a
prescription
and
consequently
valueless
this
ought
not
to
be
a
man
who
loves
his
wife
should
in
order
to
save
that
life
overwork
and
misery
and
danger
of
death
and
wretchedly
constituted
children
be
able
and
willing
to
undergo
as
much
as
everyone
of
his
contingent
bachelor
acquaintances
does
not
out
of
high
devotion
but
for
motives
of
economy
or
indifference
or
love
of
liberty
the
man
who
can
not
do
this
or
does
not
care
to
do
it
does
not
certainly
deserve
a
very
high
position
but
while
all
this
is
granted
the
question
is
still
constantly
put
is
this
all
is
there
no
means
by
which
we
can
limit
our
families
without
either
injuring
the
health
or
undergoing
a
which
not
one
man
in
a
thousand
will
submit
to
in
meeting
the
perplexities
of
this
situation
pomeroy
in
ethics
of
marriage
says
there
are
circumstances
under
which
means
for
the
avoidance
of
conception
may
be
desirable
and
proper
as
for
instance
to
prevent
too
rapid
childbearing
on
the
part
of
women
who
can
not
nurse
their
infants
or
who
have
their
usual
periods
while
nursing
conditions
which
i
believe
our
artificial
life
are
responsible
for
and
so
are
liable
to
too
frequent
conception
for
such
and
other
legitimate
causes
nature
has
herself
provided
a
means
which
with
the
practice
of
a
little
will
give
a
reasonable
degree
of
safety
beyond
this
it
is
neither
safe
nor
proper
to
act
without
the
advice
of
some
physician
who
has
sound
judgment
both
in
medicine
and
in
morals
there
is
a
scriptural
provision
which
is
doubtless
designed
to
meet
this
very
condition
and
which
may
be
properly
mentioned
here
because
authorized
by
the
inspired
word
the
law
concerning
this
matter
will
be
found
in
the
fifteenth
chapter
of
leviticus
beginning
with
the
nineteenth
verse
in
this
passage
a
period
of
strict
separation
is
prescribed
for
the
woman
during
the
period
of
her
monthly
issue
and
the
injunction
is
that
when
she
is
cleansed
from
her
issue
then
she
shall
number
to
herself
seven
days
and
after
that
she
shall
be
clean
on
the
eighth
day
she
was
to
appear
before
the
priest
with
her
offerings
when
she
was
to
be
declared
clean
in
this
old
testament
provision
god
manifestly
intended
to
make
the
children
of
israel
intelligent
not
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
them
to
avoid
any
reasonable
and
right
increase
in
their
families
but
measurably
to
limit
the
number
of
offspring
so
that
the
very
best
type
of
human
life
might
be
the
fruitage
of
their
homes
when
literally
followed
it
would
doubtless
in
a
large
majority
of
cases
afford
all
necessary
relief
and
properly
limit
the
number
of
offspring
this
passage
also
clearly
indicates
the
importance
of
separation
during
the
periodic
sickness
and
the
basis
for
this
old
testament
teaching
of
separation
during
such
times
is
based
not
only
upon
the
sense
of
delicacy
and
propriety
upon
the
part
of
the
wife
but
also
upon
the
physiological
and
sanitary
principles
of
medical
science
it
is
neither
necessary
nor
proper
for
us
to
go
into
a
further
discussion
of
this
subject
at
this
place
those
who
find
themselves
laboring
under
the
burdens
infirmities
and
unfitness
we
have
indicated
should
be
free
to
seek
such
medical
counsel
and
advice
as
will
afford
them
what
relief
may
be
available
in
their
particular
case
we
would
warn
all
however
that
those
who
take
active
measures
to
prevent
conception
are
apt
to
carry
the
matter
further
than
they
intended
at
the
best
they
are
tampering
with
nature
and
that
is
a
dangerous
thing
in
itself
in
seeking
medical
counsel
let
us
carefully
advise
all
to
exercise
the
utmost
caution
in
selecting
a
competent
conscientious
christian
physician
if
however
you
expect
that
your
interview
will
bring
you
such
information
as
will
enable
you
to
indulge
your
passion
unrestrained
and
avoid
all
consequences
allow
us
to
say
before
such
an
interview
takes
place
that
you
are
expecting
information
which
medical
science
does
not
possess
pomeroy
in
writing
upon
this
subject
says
as
before
noticed
it
is
surprising
to
what
extent
the
laity
believe
that
the
course
of
nature
can
be
safely
interfered
with
even
by
those
who
understand
her
laws
the
least
those
who
fear
to
turn
back
the
hands
of
a
watch
lest
they
injure
the
complicated
and
delicate
machinery
do
not
hesitate
to
use
violent
means
to
interfere
with
the
natural
workings
of
the
human
mechanism
which
is
a
thousandfold
more
complicated
and
delicate
nature
is
tenacious
of
her
rights
she
resists
grandly
but
if
forced
to
yield
she
visits
the
offender
with
punishment
which
is
no
less
sure
because
it
is
sometimes
few
seem
to
know
this
many
act
as
though
they
considered
nature
a
sort
of
clever
idiot
too
stupid
to
recognize
an
injury
or
too
amiable
to
resent
it
if
discovered
while
others
seem
to
look
upon
nature
as
rather
intelligent
and
able
but
a
servant
amenable
to
guidance
and
assistance
in
the
forces
of
her
laboratory
this
is
absurd
and
even
impious
for
nature
is
but
another
term
for
the
creator
of
all
things
and
he
is
infinitely
wise
nature
cares
more
about
correcting
than
our
mistakes
and
follies
were
she
to
go
on
indefinitely
and
patiently
undoing
our
work
we
should
go
on
indefinitely
and
persistently
doing
it
and
our
wrongdoing
would
be
righted
but
we
should
remain
in
the
mental
or
moral
or
physical
sin
which
had
prompted
it
indeed
if
the
obvious
results
of
our
sin
were
promptly
removed
we
should
scarcely
be
aware
that
we
were
not
in
harmony
with
nature
plans
and
the
race
would
deteriorate
and
finally
become
extinct
where
you
do
not
obtain
from
a
reputable
intelligent
christian
physician
the
information
you
desire
or
the
relief
you
seek
do
not
make
the
fatal
mistake
of
resorting
to
some
quack
or
impostor
who
advertises
only
to
beguile
deceive
and
rob
you
and
subsequently
to
leave
you
humiliated
with
purse
depleted
and
health
ruined
reputable
physicians
do
not
advertise
and
the
very
fact
that
a
man
advertises
may
be
accepted
as
sufficient
evidence
that
he
is
not
an
accredited
and
reliable
physician
and
that
you
will
most
assuredly
be
subjected
to
deception
and
imposture
persons
who
recognize
the
propriety
of
limiting
the
number
of
offspring
are
seriously
exposed
to
the
danger
of
deferring
and
procrastinating
to
such
an
extent
as
to
err
greatly
in
the
direction
of
too
few
rather
than
too
many
children
with
most
women
the
time
for
childbearing
is
quite
like
the
time
and
location
of
a
boil
any
other
time
than
the
present
and
any
other
place
than
where
it
is
a
purposed
parenthood
is
in
of
becoming
a
purpose
to
evade
parenthood
there
is
however
a
proper
and
preparation
for
parenthood
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
subject
no
person
can
help
but
be
deeply
impressed
with
the
fact
that
if
the
parents
of
this
generation
would
realize
their
wonderful
power
to
mold
and
fashion
the
succeeding
generation
the
children
of
the
next
decade
would
rise
to
the
level
of
an
entirely
new
plane
some
people
seem
to
think
that
the
matter
of
begetting
a
child
like
the
matter
of
selecting
a
wife
or
a
husband
should
be
left
wholly
to
blind
chance
neither
of
these
two
important
events
can
be
too
much
safeguarded
by
wise
and
thoughtful
consideration
if
conception
is
permitted
to
take
place
when
either
one
or
both
of
the
parents
are
in
ill
health
if
the
wife
is
an
unwilling
mother
and
the
embryo
is
developed
by
her
while
her
entire
nature
rebels
against
the
admission
into
the
family
of
a
child
who
is
not
wanted
the
children
begotten
and
born
under
such
circumstances
can
never
be
other
than
sickly
nervous
and
fretful
during
their
entire
childhood
and
cross
and
uncompanionable
throughout
their
entire
lives
in
connection
with
childbearing
there
are
three
very
important
things
first
the
preparation
for
parenthood
second
the
mental
state
at
the
period
of
conjunction
and
third
the
mental
state
and
physical
condition
of
the
mother
during
the
months
while
the
body
and
character
of
the
child
are
being
fashioned
within
her
body
the
period
and
the
character
of
the
preparation
for
parenthood
must
always
vary
according
to
the
physical
condition
of
the
intending
parents
in
some
instances
this
preparation
needs
to
extend
over
weeks
and
in
other
instances
even
over
years
no
man
or
woman
should
consent
to
become
a
parent
except
at
such
times
when
physically
and
intellectually
they
are
at
their
very
best
indeed
the
very
best
that
is
possible
for
them
to
attain
by
a
course
of
careful
preparation
much
of
what
might
be
said
here
will
be
learned
under
a
subsequent
chapter
upon
prenatal
influences
medical
authorities
universally
attach
great
importance
to
the
mental
condition
at
the
moment
of
conjunction
and
conception
it
is
quite
universally
believed
that
this
is
a
moment
of
unparalleled
importance
to
the
welfare
of
the
future
being
hufeland
an
eminent
german
writer
says
in
my
opinion
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
this
moment
should
be
confined
to
a
period
when
the
sensation
of
collected
powers
ardent
passion
and
a
mind
cheerful
and
free
from
care
invite
to
it
on
both
sides
it
is
an
awful
crime
to
beget
life
carelessly
and
when
in
improper
and
unworthy
physical
and
mental
states
the
ancients
understood
the
importance
of
this
moment
and
frequently
surrounded
the
nuptial
couch
with
statues
which
should
charm
the
mother
by
their
beautiful
outlines
and
physical
proportions
it
was
claimed
by
them
that
a
man
who
was
himself
deformed
might
in
this
manner
become
the
father
of
children
that
were
possessed
of
fine
physical
proportions
while
this
statement
might
carry
with
it
too
much
presumption
yet
it
was
not
without
a
considerable
element
of
truth
nearly
eighteen
centuries
before
christ
the
patriarch
jacob
recognized
this
principle
when
he
arranged
with
laban
to
accept
from
among
the
flocks
and
herds
the
speckled
and
the
spotted
as
the
reward
of
his
labor
in
attending
the
flocks
of
the
herds
of
his
there
was
nothing
unnatural
or
miraculous
in
the
result
which
jacob
secured
he
sought
to
produce
such
mental
impressions
upon
the
minds
of
the
flock
at
the
time
of
conception
as
would
secure
the
production
of
young
marked
after
the
manner
most
in
accord
with
his
personal
interests
we
are
told
that
jacob
took
him
rods
of
green
poplar
and
of
the
hazel
and
and
pilled
white
streaks
in
them
and
made
the
white
appear
which
was
in
the
rods
and
he
set
the
rods
which
he
had
pilled
before
the
flocks
in
the
gutters
in
the
when
the
flocks
came
to
drink
that
they
should
conceive
when
they
came
to
drink
and
the
flocks
conceived
before
the
rods
and
brought
forth
cattle
speckled
and
spotted
and
jacob
did
separate
the
lambs
and
set
the
faces
of
the
flocks
toward
the
and
all
the
brown
in
the
flock
of
laban
and
he
put
his
own
flocks
by
themselves
and
put
them
not
unto
laban
cattle
and
it
came
to
pass
whensoever
the
stronger
cattle
did
conceive
that
jacob
laid
the
rods
before
the
eyes
of
the
cattle
in
the
gutters
that
they
might
conceive
among
the
rods
but
when
the
cattle
were
feeble
he
put
them
not
in
so
the
feebler
were
laban
and
the
stronger
jacob
and
the
man
increased
exceedingly
and
had
much
cattle
and
and
and
camels
and
asses
much
of
the
differences
which
exist
between
children
of
the
same
parents
may
be
easily
attributed
to
the
different
bodily
and
mental
conditions
of
the
parents
at
the
period
of
conjunction
the
changed
physical
intellectual
and
emotional
states
of
the
parents
at
the
different
periods
of
conception
producing
the
corresponding
differences
in
their
offspring
the
results
of
purposed
and
prepared
parenthood
are
so
great
and
so
desirable
that
a
husband
and
wife
should
consider
these
matters
carefully
make
due
preparations
and
approach
the
period
when
they
would
beget
offspring
and
bring
immortal
beings
into
the
world
with
the
greatest
thoughtfulness
consideration
and
also
with
prayer
the
writer
well
remembers
the
deep
impression
made
upon
his
mind
in
an
interview
with
a
physician
who
was
the
first
to
present
this
phase
of
the
subject
to
our
consideration
the
statement
was
so
unusual
that
it
made
a
lasting
impression
upon
us
but
why
may
it
not
be
so
after
a
period
of
preparation
why
should
not
the
intending
parents
unite
at
the
throne
of
grace
for
god
blessing
upon
them
in
the
act
in
which
they
are
about
to
engage
and
in
the
fulfillment
of
their
desire
for
an
heir
who
shall
be
possessed
of
the
very
best
physical
intellectual
and
moral
endowments
there
are
certain
signs
of
fruitful
conjunction
which
are
often
recognized
by
women
who
are
already
mothers
but
which
may
serve
as
no
guide
to
a
young
wife
who
has
never
had
any
experience
with
some
women
the
act
of
conception
is
attended
with
great
emotion
a
sense
of
unusual
pleasure
and
even
of
a
tremor
in
which
all
parts
of
the
body
may
participate
sometimes
it
is
followed
by
a
sense
of
weakness
in
ancient
times
the
swelling
of
the
neck
was
regarded
as
a
sign
of
conception
and
some
modern
authorities
incline
to
the
same
theory
there
are
instances
also
in
which
the
morning
sickness
begins
immediately
after
conception
it
would
be
unsafe
however
to
rely
upon
either
the
presence
or
absence
of
these
indications
in
most
instances
the
cessation
of
the
menses
and
the
appearance
of
the
morning
sickness
are
the
first
reliable
indications
that
conception
has
taken
place
chapter
xiii
the
expectant
mother
a
husband
whether
young
or
old
should
treat
his
wife
with
great
consideration
at
all
times
but
if
at
any
time
she
deserves
more
thoughtful
consideration
and
more
tender
ministry
than
at
any
other
it
is
during
the
period
of
her
pregnancy
the
young
husband
should
remember
that
oftentimes
the
of
the
young
wife
is
not
yet
aroused
but
is
measurably
dormant
god
has
intended
that
wifehood
should
precede
motherhood
where
the
longing
for
children
is
present
the
young
wife
intelligent
and
where
she
has
been
physically
fitted
for
the
office
of
motherhood
upon
which
she
has
now
entered
her
equipment
is
exceptional
her
mind
complacent
and
she
may
reasonably
be
expected
to
go
forward
in
a
spirit
which
will
secure
for
her
in
the
coming
months
the
largest
blessing
and
reward
but
with
most
young
wives
it
is
not
so
the
knowledge
which
would
have
been
most
important
for
them
has
been
withheld
by
silent
mothers
they
may
have
received
a
liberal
education
but
in
the
study
of
physiology
the
special
parts
concerning
which
she
needed
most
to
know
have
been
excluded
from
the
and
she
knows
no
more
concerning
her
own
special
physiology
than
she
does
about
the
physiology
of
the
male
books
which
would
have
rendered
her
intelligent
have
been
studiously
kept
out
of
her
sight
and
perhaps
during
her
girlhood
she
has
been
encouraged
in
compressing
her
waist
displacing
the
vital
organs
which
god
has
placed
in
the
abdomen
and
through
a
period
of
years
gone
on
ignorantly
or
wilfully
unfitting
herself
for
the
main
duties
of
maternity
perhaps
she
has
entered
upon
marriage
as
so
many
do
with
an
undefined
dread
of
some
impending
evil
attending
conception
and
childbearing
which
she
has
desired
and
hoped
to
escape
in
some
inscrutable
manner
the
discovery
of
the
fact
that
she
is
to
become
a
mother
fills
her
mind
with
dread
and
alarm
in
her
ignorance
she
gropes
her
way
in
darkness
not
knowing
whither
to
turn
and
with
no
one
to
guide
her
to
the
light
she
naturally
turns
to
married
women
and
to
mothers
and
instead
of
receiving
encouragement
and
the
proper
kind
of
sympathy
they
most
likely
exclaim
i
am
sorry
for
you
now
your
trouble
begins
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
feel
like
jumping
into
the
river
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
with
the
darkness
intensified
and
her
mind
more
alarmed
than
ever
apprehension
turns
to
fear
and
fear
into
alarm
and
dread
the
young
husband
should
remember
that
this
is
about
the
usual
experience
of
most
young
wives
and
intelligently
arrange
to
correct
the
evil
if
you
are
acquainted
with
some
intelligent
sympathetic
and
judicious
woman
who
will
know
how
to
take
your
young
wife
into
her
arms
allay
her
fears
comfort
and
instruct
her
you
will
be
most
fortunate
she
should
be
able
to
point
out
to
the
troubled
wife
the
fact
that
intelligence
and
care
will
greatly
mitigate
and
indeed
enable
her
largely
to
avoid
all
physical
suffering
to
explain
to
her
how
as
the
months
go
by
the
will
spring
up
in
her
heart
as
the
time
approaches
for
the
happiest
hour
in
her
life
when
for
the
first
time
her
own
infant
child
shall
lie
in
her
arms
or
by
her
side
to
picture
the
joy
of
her
husband
and
the
gladness
which
will
come
into
the
hearts
of
all
who
know
her
and
who
will
come
to
rejoice
over
her
newborn
child
to
picture
what
her
home
will
be
as
contrasted
with
those
who
dejected
and
lonely
sit
in
desolate
homes
where
no
little
prattler
breaks
the
stillness
of
the
hours
and
no
footfalls
are
heard
in
the
hallway
this
judicious
friend
will
need
to
know
how
to
impress
upon
her
that
her
mental
condition
during
the
period
which
precedes
the
advent
of
the
little
stranger
will
mold
and
fashion
its
character
and
how
if
she
desires
a
loving
child
she
must
herself
love
the
child
before
it
is
born
if
she
desires
in
her
child
a
quiet
and
happy
disposition
she
must
herself
determine
that
result
by
her
own
even
temper
and
be
warned
that
her
worry
and
repining
will
render
her
child
nervous
and
fretful
if
she
desires
her
child
to
be
cheery
and
bright
and
happy
she
should
enact
in
her
own
thought
and
life
what
she
desires
her
child
to
be
that
now
for
a
brief
period
she
is
molding
not
simply
its
physical
frame
but
its
character
and
disposition
and
giving
bent
and
expression
to
the
entire
future
of
the
human
life
that
is
being
formed
within
her
it
will
not
do
when
the
husband
finds
his
wife
despondent
that
he
should
be
annoyed
by
expressions
which
are
quite
natural
to
one
in
her
condition
no
young
husband
can
enter
sufficiently
into
the
sufferings
and
feelings
of
his
wife
in
these
earliest
days
and
weeks
of
apprehension
and
dread
she
needs
to
be
comforted
with
words
of
greatest
tenderness
your
heart
should
go
out
toward
her
in
sincere
sympathy
put
away
from
your
heart
such
feelings
as
foolish
girl
what
did
she
get
married
for
did
she
not
know
that
she
was
expected
to
bear
children
like
other
women
she
is
not
suffering
more
than
other
women
have
suffered
all
this
is
only
in
the
course
of
nature
what
use
is
there
of
making
a
fuss
she
should
submit
to
it
in
the
proper
spirit
if
you
harbor
such
thoughts
whether
properly
or
improperly
they
will
nevertheless
unfit
you
for
that
degree
of
sympathy
which
you
should
feel
and
not
feign
the
months
of
pregnancy
with
most
women
are
months
of
discomfort
some
women
are
in
better
health
more
cheery
and
hopeful
during
the
period
of
gestation
than
at
any
other
period
in
their
lives
but
this
is
not
generally
the
case
rather
the
reverse
during
gestation
some
women
are
a
terror
to
their
husbands
and
render
themselves
miserable
and
all
about
them
uncomfortable
and
unhappy
during
this
period
the
wife
ceases
to
be
physically
attractive
and
for
her
own
protection
and
the
protection
of
the
embryo
nature
makes
the
wife
sexually
repellant
soon
the
morning
sickness
is
likely
to
begin
and
when
she
rises
in
the
morning
she
will
likely
feel
sick
and
nauseated
and
vomiting
will
frequently
ensue
relief
can
not
always
be
afforded
and
this
condition
may
continue
for
weeks
or
even
for
months
the
young
wife
soon
becomes
the
target
for
all
kinds
of
injudicious
advice
she
is
told
to
eat
heartily
of
strong
food
to
keep
up
her
strength
and
to
furnish
nourishment
for
two
her
natural
modes
of
life
are
oftentimes
unnecessarily
restricted
and
after
a
period
with
a
sense
of
false
modesty
she
often
shuts
herself
out
from
fresh
air
and
exercise
and
becomes
a
prisoner
in
her
own
home
or
possibly
in
her
own
room
while
the
pains
and
perils
of
maternity
can
be
greatly
mitigated
yet
the
young
husband
should
be
moved
to
tenderest
consideration
because
of
the
discomforts
which
the
wife
suffers
the
apprehensions
with
which
she
looks
forward
to
the
hour
of
her
delivery
the
responsibilities
of
caring
for
and
rearing
a
child
for
usefulness
in
this
world
and
happiness
in
the
next
the
apprehensions
which
she
may
have
not
only
in
regard
to
her
own
life
but
in
bringing
into
the
world
a
creature
who
shall
be
dependent
for
many
years
upon
her
and
her
husband
and
in
the
days
of
her
nervous
anxiety
she
is
likely
to
think
of
the
possibility
of
the
death
of
her
husband
or
of
what
might
be
even
more
terrible
to
her
thought
her
sickness
or
disability
through
a
period
of
years
when
the
breadwinner
himself
might
become
dependent
upon
his
wife
and
children
for
his
own
support
persons
should
look
forward
to
this
period
and
before
conception
takes
place
make
themselves
the
possessors
of
such
information
as
would
render
them
intelligent
and
qualify
them
to
meet
the
conditions
with
the
best
physical
and
intellectual
equipment
when
the
wife
has
once
become
pregnant
it
is
then
too
late
for
her
properly
to
take
up
the
study
of
this
subject
instead
of
permitting
her
mind
to
dwell
upon
these
matters
her
attention
should
be
turned
to
other
considerations
if
she
or
her
husband
have
not
read
upon
these
subjects
until
the
event
takes
place
then
the
husband
should
devote
himself
to
the
reading
and
be
to
his
wife
a
wise
counsellor
in
the
experiences
through
which
she
is
passing
he
should
carefully
study
the
book
entitled
what
a
young
wife
ought
to
know
and
possibly
other
books
where
the
husband
has
the
time
and
the
technical
knowledge
he
might
find
it
very
helpful
to
consult
the
physician
whose
services
they
expect
to
have
at
the
time
of
confinement
and
borrow
from
him
a
medical
work
upon
the
subject
such
books
are
always
expensive
and
although
written
in
technical
terms
may
yet
prove
interesting
and
suggestive
the
greatest
danger
however
in
this
course
is
that
medical
books
deal
not
so
much
with
the
conditions
which
characterize
the
vast
majority
of
confinements
but
with
the
abnormal
and
exceptional
which
are
only
occasionally
met
and
these
exceptions
abnormal
conditions
and
hideous
monstrosities
are
likely
to
fill
the
mind
with
unnecessary
apprehension
under
no
circumstances
should
a
pregnant
wife
be
permitted
to
fill
her
mind
with
apprehension
and
alarm
by
reading
of
this
character
if
the
wife
is
to
follow
the
most
beneficial
rules
of
exercise
diet
and
mental
condition
she
will
need
to
be
encouraged
and
assisted
by
the
judicious
counsel
and
tenderest
sympathies
of
her
husband
if
she
is
allowed
to
seclude
herself
and
become
inactive
she
will
not
only
suffer
the
severest
experiences
at
the
time
of
delivery
but
her
child
will
be
likely
to
be
indifferent
to
physical
and
intellectual
activity
while
upon
the
other
hand
if
her
life
is
filled
with
a
round
of
perpetual
duties
perplexities
and
worries
which
consume
her
time
leave
her
depleted
and
allow
her
no
time
for
rest
she
is
likely
to
be
the
mother
of
a
restless
nervous
and
irritable
child
the
young
husband
should
remember
that
what
his
home
is
to
be
in
the
days
to
come
will
depend
upon
the
intelligence
and
wisdom
of
himself
and
wife
while
they
stand
at
the
sources
of
destiny
in
the
early
period
of
their
married
life
their
health
their
wisdom
their
judicious
direction
is
to
determine
not
only
their
own
present
happiness
but
the
character
of
their
children
the
condition
of
their
home
and
measurably
even
the
destinies
of
generations
yet
unborn
it
is
not
within
our
province
when
writing
to
young
husbands
to
lay
down
rules
and
to
give
full
directions
which
are
fitted
for
a
book
of
instruction
to
young
wives
and
expectant
mothers
but
as
something
might
be
properly
expected
upon
this
phase
of
the
subject
we
append
from
trained
motherhood
a
suggestive
article
on
diet
and
hygiene
for
expectant
mothers
by
a
writer
who
signs
herself
from
the
very
moment
of
consciousness
of
the
conception
of
a
new
life
every
effort
should
be
made
for
the
welfare
of
both
mother
and
child
with
the
majority
of
women
pregnancy
is
a
condition
to
be
dreaded
since
it
brings
with
it
so
much
care
pain
and
all
sorts
of
trials
ending
with
intense
suffering
the
greater
part
of
these
troubles
are
caused
by
the
violation
of
the
laws
of
nature
and
by
following
a
few
simple
rules
much
if
not
all
of
the
suffering
and
worry
women
undergo
may
be
avoided
having
received
many
requests
for
advice
the
writer
gives
for
the
benefit
of
sister
women
as
the
result
of
personal
experience
and
experiments
the
directions
and
hints
that
follow
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
trouble
is
improper
diet
another
is
improper
dress
a
third
lack
of
exercise
but
to
deal
with
one
at
a
time
we
will
place
diet
first
it
is
necessary
that
a
pregnant
woman
should
have
food
that
is
nourishing
but
not
heating
for
the
blood
it
should
be
eaten
at
regular
hours
and
in
moderate
quantities
very
few
people
can
successfully
eat
and
drink
at
one
time
so
it
will
be
much
better
to
drink
some
time
before
or
after
meals
it
is
desired
to
avoid
development
of
bone
and
muscle
as
it
is
this
growth
that
renders
the
labor
so
hard
by
choosing
food
that
lacks
these
qualities
much
trouble
may
be
avoided
all
the
vegetables
and
all
the
fruits
are
beneficial
but
all
animal
food
is
injurious
in
my
opinion
all
rich
food
such
as
pastry
cakes
confectioneries
gravies
and
fat
meats
should
be
avoided
tea
and
coffee
are
nerve
and
brain
stimulants
therefore
injurious
to
both
mother
and
child
wines
or
liquors
of
any
sort
are
very
much
to
be
condemned
all
cereals
may
be
used
freely
though
the
oat
products
are
not
to
be
so
well
recommended
as
the
wheaten
grains
since
oats
are
more
heating
eat
very
freely
of
all
fruits
particularly
the
acid
sort
oranges
and
lemons
stand
first
then
apples
peaches
and
plums
bananas
are
very
good
especially
when
eaten
in
the
morning
before
taking
other
food
be
sure
and
not
eat
too
much
of
anything
it
is
better
to
feel
a
little
hungry
than
to
eat
an
ounce
too
much
those
who
desire
a
warm
drink
may
find
some
cereal
coffee
palatable
and
beneficial
whole
wheat
or
brown
breads
are
more
desirable
than
white
breads
as
they
contain
less
starch
properties
the
sickness
may
be
done
away
with
by
eating
several
plain
crackers
soda
or
graham
before
rising
eat
them
while
lying
down
and
lie
still
for
five
minutes
then
get
up
slowly
and
gently
the
juice
of
a
lemon
or
a
banana
will
often
do
the
same
towards
removing
this
weakening
annoyance
generally
if
fruit
is
eaten
just
before
going
to
bed
no
nausea
is
felt
in
the
morning
as
to
dress
no
garment
should
be
worn
that
throws
any
weight
or
pressure
anywhere
hang
all
from
the
shoulders
a
corded
waist
with
and
buttons
for
the
skirts
will
be
comfortable
by
all
means
have
everything
as
light
in
weight
as
possible
dress
warmly
but
let
nothing
be
tight
or
heavy
wear
shoes
so
as
to
keep
the
legs
and
feet
from
swelling
under
the
strain
of
the
extra
weight
they
must
carry
plenty
of
judicious
exercise
is
necessary
housework
and
light
gardening
are
unequaled
though
the
heavier
work
such
as
washing
scrubbing
or
lifting
reaching
up
pulling
or
any
kind
of
strain
is
dangerous
climbing
stairs
and
hills
is
one
of
the
best
exercises
breathe
deeply
and
fully
filling
the
lungs
all
the
way
down
the
majority
of
women
only
breathe
with
the
upper
part
of
their
lungs
and
have
no
chest
expansion
a
healthy
woman
ought
to
be
able
to
increase
her
chest
measure
at
least
two
inches
by
a
full
inhalation
deep
breathing
not
only
gives
the
mother
more
strength
but
it
gives
the
unborn
child
a
gentle
exercise
by
means
of
the
motion
of
the
body
at
each
breath
and
renders
its
whole
system
purer
and
stronger

closed

well
up

back
and
breathe
as
fully
as
possible
while
climbing
exercise
freely
but
do
not
overdo
it
any
fatigue
drains
from
the
fetus
its
vitality
and
development
which
is
its
birthright
and
which
is
the
duty
of
every
woman
to
give
her
child
a
tepid
sitz
bath
taken
for
fifteen
minutes
just
before
going

where

do
the
most
harm
it
is
best
to
wait
until
the
third
day
at
least
after
the
child
is
born
before
changing
the
diet
and
then
the
mother
should
eat
freely
of
all
that
she
has
avoided
during
pregnancy
in
order
to
give
her
milk
the
qualities
the
child
now
needs
as
it
is
the
duty
of
all
parents
to
give
to
their
children
the
very
best
of
themselves
the
only
way
to
do
this
is
to
give
them
the
care
before

birth
that
they
intend
giving
them
after

we
can
heartily
endorse
the
directions
of
the
writer
in
every
particular
but
think
it
important
to
suggest
that
some
of
the
greatest
mistakes
made
after
confinement
are
by
impatience
to
have
the
mother
enjoy
the
privilege
of
sitting
up
going
to
the
table
for
her
meals
and
returning
to
the
ordinary
duties
of
daily
life
we
have
elsewhere
indicated
the
changes
which
take
place
at
this
period
and
which
call
for
an
entire
revolution
in
the
physical
condition
of
the
mother
this
can
not
be
accomplished
in
a
few
days
or
even
in
a
couple
of
weeks
in
most
instances
it
is
safe
for
the
young
mother
to
expect
to
remain
at
least
six
weeks
in
her
room
before
thinking
of
being
a
guest
at
the
family
table
a
mistake
at
this
time
may
eventuate
in
permanent
results
which
will
render
the
mother
an
invalid
for
all
the
rest
of
her
life
but
there
is
another
side
to
this
question
which
can
not
be
passed
over
at
this
point
without
great
injustice
to
the
sacredness
and
importance
of
the
subject
the
and
trials
during
the
period
of
gestation
do
not
all
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
wife
with
her
the
sexual
sense
has
been
satisfied
and
has
become
quiescent
while
in
the
husband
it
continues
active
and
sometimes
even
seems
imperious
if
he
is
to
treat
his
wife
with
proper
consideration
he
should
allow
nothing
to
stimulate
or
excite
his
sexual
passion
but
should
be
able
to
hold
himself
in
the
best
physical
poise
and
under
the
wisest
sexual
any
one
who
has
observed
the
life
of
birds
and
animals
and
indeed
of
all
animate
life
can
not
have
been
blind
to
the
fact
that
after
impregnation
the
female
never
receives
the
male
and
the
male
neither
of
beast
or
bird
or
reptile
never
forces
himself
upon
the
female
while
the
young
life
is
being
developed
in
the
body
of
the
female
the
sexes
remain
absolutely
apart
if
we
are
to
learn
anything
from
universal
nature
in
this
particular
we
would
seem
to
be
taught
that
the
same
should
be
true
with
husband
and
wife
it
is
a
notable
fact
that
among
the
heathen
in
polygamous
countries
the
husband
always
remains
apart
from
a
wife
in
whom
life
has
already
been
begun
strange
to
say
in
civilized
and
christian
countries
medical
writers
and
intelligent
people
are
not
always
in
accord
that
the
reader
may
understand
something
of
the
positions
which
are
taken
we
quote
from
a
few
writers
in
his
book
entitled
the
physical
life
of
woman
george
napheys
says
during
those
days
when
the
wife
if
she
were
not
pregnant
would
have
been
marital
intercourse
should
be
abstained
from
it
is
then
injurious
to
the
mother
and
dangerous
to
the
life
of
the
child
as
it
is
liable
to
excite
miscarriage
but
if
this
habitual
epoch
of
the
monthly
sickness
be
avoided
there
is
no
reason
why
passion
should
not
be
gratified
in
moderation
and
with
caution
during
the
whole
period
of
pregnancy
there
is
one
exception
to
be
made
to
this
general
course
of
conduct
in
those
cases
in
which
a
miscarriage
has
occurred
in
the
first
pregnancy
every
precaution
should
be
employed
to
prevent
its
happening
again
after
a
second
conception
under
such
exceptional
circumstances
therefore
the
husband
and
wife
should
sleep
apart
during
the
first
five
months
of
pregnancy
after
that
period
their
ordinary
relations
may
be
resumed
when
a
miscarriage
has
taken
place
intercourse
should
not
be
permitted
within
a
month
of
the
accident
the
observance
of
this
direction
is
of
the
utmost
importance
its
neglect
is
the
frequent
cause
of
severe
and
intractable
diseases
of
the
womb
another
when
speaking
of
the
effects
of
coition
during
this
period
says
the
organ
of
amativeness
is
frequently
too
largely
developed
in
the
embryonic
offspring
by
the
excessive
indulgence
of
parents
in
sexual
pleasures
during
the
period
of
gestation
after
the
birth
of
the
child
he
is
usually
fed
on
meat
tea
and
coffee
and
other
stimulating
food
and
drink
fit
only
for
persons
of
adult
age
by
which
sexual
precocity
is
produced
john
cowan
in
the
science
of
a
new
life
says
with
emphasis
i
will
again
repeat
that
during
this
full
period
of
gestative
influence
as
well
as
during
the
period
of
nursing
congress
should
not
be
had
between
husband
and
this
is
the
law
of
nature
the
law
of
god
and
outside
of
christendom
it
is
never
violated
animals
will
not
permit
it
savages
will
not
permit
it
and
over
of
the
world
it
is
looked
upon
as
infamous
by
our
own
species
a
man
acting
out
the
licentiousness
of
his
nature
with
his
wife
during
gestation
is
worse
than
a
brute
in
fact
there
is
no
species
of
the
animal
to
which
he
can
be
compared
unless
it
be
to
the
tobacco
to
a
whose
life
is
an
epitome
of
tobacco
whiskey
and
licentiousness
do
not
i
pray
you
oh
parents
do
this
unclean
thing
do
not
taint
your
clean
bodies
do
not
foul
your
pure
souls
with
the
lustful
of
your
natures
while
a
new
body
is
being
developed
a
new
soul
being
organized
but
by
sweet
words
loving
caresses
endearing
action
and
warm
kisses
cultivate
within
you
the
love
element
that
in
its
pure
exercise
joins
together
two
souls

brings
in
its
path

a
measure
of
peace

happiness
as
must
be
realized

can
be
appreciated
writing
of
the
physical
needs
of
the
mother
during
the
period
of
gestation
napheys
says
during
this
period
the
whole
force
of
the
economy
at
these
times
is
taken
up
with
providing
sustenance
for
the
new
being
and
there
is
no
nervous
power
left
to
be
wasted
in
barren
pleasures
in
those
exceptionable
cases
where
this
does
not
hold
every
excitement
is
visited
upon
the
child
and
it
has
to
suffer
in
health
and
growth
for
the
unnatural
appetite
of
the
mother
black
says
coition
during
pregnancy
is
one
of
the
ways
in
which
the
predisposition
is
made
for
that
terrible
disease
in
children
epilepsy
the
natural
excitement
of
the
nervous
system
in
the
mother
by
such
a
cause
can
not
operate
otherwise
than
inflicting
injury
upon
the
tender
germ
in
the
womb
kellogg
says
indulgence
during
pregnancy
is
followed
by
the
worst
results
of
any
form
of
marital
excess
the
mother
suffers
doubly
because
laden
with
the
burden
of
supporting
two
lives
instead
of
one
but
the
results
upon
the
child
are
especially
disastrous
during
the
time
when
it
is
receiving
its
stock
of
vitality
while
its
plastic
form
is
being
molded
and
its
various
organs
are
acquiring
that
integrity
of
structure
which
makes
up
what
is
called
constitutional
vigor
during
this
most
critical
of
all
periods
in
the
life
of
the
new
being
its
forces
are
exhausted
and
its
structure
is
depraved
and
thus
constitutional
tendencies
to
disease
are
produced
by
the
unnatural
demands
made
upon
the
mother
the
same
author
adds
still
another
terrible
consequence
results
from
this
practice
so
contrary
to
nature
the
delicate
brain
which
is
being
molded
with
the
other
organs
of
the
body
receives
its
cast
largely
from
those
mental
and
nervous
sensations
and
actions
of
the
mother
which
are
the
most
intense
one
of
the
most
certain
effects
of
sexual
indulgence
at
this
time
is
to
develop
abnormally
the
sexual
instinct
in
the
child
here
is
the
key
to
the
origin
of
much
of
the
sexual
precocity
and
depravity
which
curse
humanity
sexuality
is
born
in
the
soul
of
a
large
share
of
the
rising
generation
in
her
book
entitled
tokology
alice
stockham
says
if
the
law
of
continence
is
not
the
law
to
govern
one
entire
life
it
is
natural
and
reasonable
that
the
mother
should
be
exempt
from
the
sexual
relation
during
gestation
in
an
excellent
little
book
entitled
approaching
maternity
a
physician
of
experience
says
a
man
once
told
me
that
the
easiest
delivery
his
wife
had
ever
had
took
place
two
days
sooner
than
expected
and
one
day
after
he
had
had
connection
with
her
thank
heaven
there
are
not
many
such
brutes
as
this
what
really
took
place
was
a
miscarriage
in
my
opinion
superinduced
by
coition
that
it
was
not
troublesome
was
a
piece
of
good
luck
and
must
have
been
the
result
of
the
woman
excellent
condition
it
is
better
that
during
the
entire
pregnancy
sexual
intercourse
should
be
abstained
from
during
coition
the
uterus
is
subjected
to
great
disturbance
congestion
of
many
of
the
parts
follows
and
the
effect
upon
the
nerves
is
of
a
harmful
nature
the
entire
vital
energy
of
the
woman
is
needed
and
should
be
saved
for
the
coming
event
and
the
husband
should
practice
and
forego
selfish
indulgence
at
this
time
strive
rather
to
elevate
and
develop
the
intellectual
side
of
the
woman
and
if
her
mind
is
kept
occupied
upon
helpful
entertaining
subjects
a
good
result
will
show
later
on
when
we
remember
that
in
procreation
god
has
endowed
us
with
the
power
to
continue
his
work
of
creation
and
realize
the
sacred
responsibilities
in
calling
a
new
life
into
being
we
can
not
but
feel
that
from
the
very
hour
of
conception
the
mother
is
overshadowed
by
the
most
high
in
the
fulfillment
of
her
sacred
office
she
should
surely
be
delivered
from
all
polluting
intrusions
and
be
permitted
to
live
a
life
of
spotless
purity
to
say
the
very
least
there
surely
is
something
very
suggestive
in
the
statement
of
the
first
chapter
of
matthew
concerning
the
parents
of
the
child
jesus
when
he
had
been
begotten
of
the
holy
ghost
mary
was
not
to
be
deprived
of
the
companionship
love
and
sympathy
of
joseph
and
therefore
when
he
thought
to
put
her
away
privily
he
was
told
fear
not
to
take
unto
thee
mary
thy
wife
for
that
which
is
conceived
in
her
is
of
the
holy
ghost
then
joseph
being
raised
from
sleep
did
as
the
angel
of
the
lord
had
bidden
him
and
took
unto
him
his
wife
knew
her
not
till
she
had
brought
forth
her
while
it
was
essential
that
the
fatherhood
of
the
messiah
should
be
above
all
question
yet
may
it
not
be
true
that
the
development
and
bringing
forth
of
a
child
which
shall
be
most
like
unto
this
prince
of
peace
always
demands
an
undisturbed
maternity
we
would
not
like
to
take
an
extreme
position
upon
this
subject
but
we
are
persuaded
that
what
we
have
presented
here
is
worthy
of
the
thoughtful
consideration
of
all
husbands
and
wives
who
seek
their
own
highest
good
and
the
greatest
blessing
and
of
the
children
which
are
to
be
it
is
well
for
young
husbands
and
wives
to
know
that
by
incautiousness
in
their
relations
during
this
period
miscarriage
is
often
easily
and
actually
produced
and
unsuspecting
parents
have
oftentimes
been
the
authors
not
only
of
the
death
of
their
own
child
but
the
consequences
have
entailed
permanent
injuries
upon
the
young
wife
and
oftentimes
resulted
in

the
changes
which
precede
attend
and
follow
conception
and
childbirth
from
the
moment
of
conception
during
the
months
of
gestation
at
the
time
of
childbirth
and
after
changes
of
great
interest
take
place
in
the
germ
of
human
life
and
in
the
body
of
the
mother
her
body
is
marvelously
fitted
for
the
reception
and
development
of
the
ovum
the
embryo
and
the
fetus
through
the
various
stages
of
fertilization
germination
development
maturity
to
the
time
of
the
eventual
exit
of
the
child
into
the
outer
world
to
begin
its
own
independent
life
something
of
the
adaptation
of
the
body
of
the
mother
to
its
marvelous
purpose
may
the
better
appear
if
we
think
of
some
of
the
greatest
mechanical
achievements
of
man
a
watch
is
one
of
the
best
products
of
human
ingenuity
it
has
taken
nearly
six
thousand
years
to
produce
it
it
is
a
wonderful
piece
of
mechanism
yet
it
is
after
all
not
a
complex
product
like
the
human
body
if
a
watch
could
be
constructed
that
could
oil
and
renew
its
own
parts
so
as
not
to
stop
or
break
or
need
repairing
or
oiling
or
cleaning
such
a
product
would
be
more
complex
but
if
in
addition
to
running
on
uninterruptedly
for
a
long
series
of
years
or
almost
an
entire
century
suppose
it
could
be
so
constructed
and
constituted
that
without
interrupting
the
orderly
movement
of
its
works
or
its
accuracy
and
correctness
it
should
at
intervals
produce
other
watches
like
itself
truly
such
a
watch
would
be
a
marvelous
complexity
yet
just
such
a
complexity
is
found
in
all
the
forms
of
vegetable
and
animal
life
about
us
interesting
as
is
the
study
of
life
at
any
stage
it
is
specially
interesting
and
impressive
during
the
periods
which
preface
accomplish
and
follow
the
wonderful
period
of
gestation
and
it
is
specially
important
that
the
individual
who
stands
so
closely
related
to
this
profound
and
mystery
as
does
a
young
husband
should
have
such
knowledge
of
what
this
condition
has
to
teach
as
comes
within
the
realm
of
human
understanding
both
because
of
its
importance
to
his
own
happiness
the
happiness
safety
and
of
the
mother
and
her
offspring
and
because
such
knowledge
will
tend
to
purify
the
mind
of
those
gross
and
debasing
thoughts
which
too
frequently
cluster
about
the
most
important
and
most
sacred
relations
of
married
life
and
the
endearments
of
home
something
of
what
these
changes
are
which
precede
attend
and
follow
reproduction
in
the
human
family
may
be
beautifully
seen
in
a
conservatory
or
garden
or
even
learned
from
the
frail
flower
that
blooms
by
the
roadside
when
in
the
springtime
or
summer
days
the
plant
has
reached
its
maturity
as
instinctively
as
if
it
foresaw
in
the
coming
days
of
autumn
and
in
the
ice
and
snow
of
winter
the
possibility
not
only
of
death
but
of
total
extinction
its
entire
nature
centres
in
one
grand
struggle
to
escape
pending
extermination
and
live
if
not
in
its
own
body
yet
in
the
life
and
beauty
that
shall
be
reproduced
in
the
plants
that
are
already
begotten
in
the
longing
for
the
perpetuity
of
its
own
life
the
dual
is
quickened
forgetting
the
present
and
longing
for
a
place
and
a
part
when
the
warm
and
quickening
breath
of
spring
shall
again
usher
in
a
new
day
of
life
and
beauty
upon
the
earth
the
plant
henceforth
lives
not
for
the
present
but
for
the
future
not
for
itself
but
for
those
that
are
to
be
the
buds
begin
to
form
the
plant
has
learned
the
purpose
of
being
and
throbs
with
the
mystery
of
life
in
the
thought
of
death
it
has
learned
to
live
in
fear
of
extinction
it
has
learned
to
perpetuate
and
multiply
itself
a
hundredfold
the
flower
unfolds
the
dual
of
the
plant
lives
with
intensity
in
their
common
effort
the
flower
is
in
a
passion
of
beauty
in
an
agony
of
splendor
perfuming
the
nuptial
hour
with
a
sweetness
that
distills
upon
the
air
arresting
the
hurrying
steps
of
all
who
pass
by
who
shall
dare
to
interrupt
that
ceremonial
whose
ruthless
hand
shall
dare
defeat
that
high
and
holy
purpose
the
fragrance
invites
the
bees
and
insects
to
the
nuptial
feast
for
them
there
is
pollen
and
nectar
in
abundance
they
bear
gifts
of
quickening
pollen
from
other
plants
or
swing
the
anther
censers
that
waited
the
coming
of
expected
guests
the
corolla
of
beauty
screens
the
enchanted
participants
the
ceremonial
is
over
the
hour
is
ended
the
ovules
have
felt
the
thrill
of
life
the
beauty
fades
the
fragrance
is
gone
the
are
laid
aside
and
henceforth
the
and
the
of
the
plant
live
not
for
themselves
but
for
the
life
they
have
begotten
and
the
plants
that
shall
be
their
joy
abides
and
they
live
in
the
glad
hope
of
participation
in
the
succeeding
resurrection
of
the
life
and
beauty
and
fragrance
that
is
to
await
the
coming
of
another
springtime
what
we
have
written
in
allegory
takes
place
in
fact
every
intelligent
observer
has
noted
the
depth
of
color
passionate
beauty
and
sweet
fragrance
of
the
flower
as
the
hour
approaches
when
the
stigma
awaits
the
pollen
which
is
to
fertilize
the
ovules
that
lie
hidden
away
in
the
ovary
or
pod
when
that
union
has
been
effected
the
flower
fades
its
petals
fall
off
the
calyx
which
as
a
vase
held
the
corolla
erect
in
its
splendor
but
which
remains
to
shield
and
protect
the
ovules
or
little
seeds
which
are
being
formed
and
perfected
now
droops
turning
toward
the
earth
is
this
a
sign
of
sadness
or
that
there
is
no
longer
any
joy
in
life
no
no
not
at
all
it
is
the
evidence
of
its
fidelity
to
the
sacred
trust
that
has
been
committed
to
it
it
has
found
a
new
joy
a
more
abiding
happiness
then
it
held
up
the
corolla
that
the
sun
and
the
angels
might
look
in
upon
the
happy
and
holy
beginnings
of
life
while
now
in
the
protection
of
its
sacred
trust
it
turns
down
that
it
may
shed
the
rain
and
everything
that
might
intrude
or
hurt
the
tender
plant
that
is
so
mysteriously
encased
in
that
pod
that
enlarges
with
the
growing
life
that
is
within
it
what
is
true
in
the
reproductive
life
of
plants
is
also
true
in
the
reproductive
life
of
man
the
changes
that
take
place
at
the
moment
of
conception
and
during
the
period
of
gestation
are
full
of
marvelous
beauty
and
profound
mystery
the
bright
eyes
the
ruby
lips
the
ruddy
glow
on
the
cheeks
the
comely
attire
the
attractive
manner
the
persuasive
sweetness
the
subtle
but
indescribable
attractiveness
are
manifestations
in
human
life
of
what
may
be
seen
and
studied
with
such
impressiveness
in
the
reproductive
life
of
the
flower
the
changes
which
follow
may
not
be
as
immediate
and
while
to
the
unknowing
and
unobservant
they
may
not
at
first
be
totally
unobserved
yet
to
the
devout
student
they
are
quite
as
manifest
and
pronounced
as
in
the
flowers
and
the
study
of
these
changes
which
attend
the
beginning
the
growth
and
the
completion
of
reproduction
is
one
of
great
interest
to
every
intelligent
person
although
its
clear
presentation
to
those
who
have
no
knowledge
whatever
of
the
subject
is
attended
with
some
difficulty
as
the
birds
at
the
mating
season
put
on
their
most
gorgeous
plumage
sing
their
sweetest
songs
and
in
the
building
of
their
nests
work
in
sweetest
accord
so
it
is
also
in
human
life
when
the
nest
is
completed
the
eggs
laid
and
the
incubation
or
hatching
begins
the
plumage
soon
loses
some
of
its
lustre
the
songs
become
less
frequent
and
the
parent
birds
prepare
for
the
feeding
and
care
of
the
that
is
soon
to
fill
the
nest
but
all
this
quickening
of
life
and
growth
that
takes
place
in
the
egg
within
the
nest
under
the
warm
body
of
the
in
the
human
mother
takes
place
within
the
nest
or
cradle
which
god
has
prepared
within
her
body
her
young
is
of
a
higher
order
the
protection
and
preservation
of
the
unfolding
human
life
is
more
important
and
hence
the
greater
care
displayed
in
guarding
and
nourishing
it
the
future
mother
whose
nature
only
recently
craved
her
caresses
and
embraces
now
perhaps
all
unconsciously
to
herself
changes
to
fit
her
for
the
better
completion
of
the
sacred
and
holy
work
which
god
has
assigned
her
the
eye
loses
somewhat
of
its
lustre
the
cheek
its
ruddy
glow
and
her
entire
being
something
of
that
pervasive
sweetness
which
but
recently
made
her
peculiarly
attractive
but
to
the
intelligent
husband
and
true
father
she
is
none
the
less
but
rather
the
more
an
object
of
love
and
adoration
and
if
she
is
intelligent
and
understands
the
high
and
holy
nature
of
that
which
is
being
wrought
within
her
own
body
and
the
exalted
honor
which
god
has
bestowed
upon
her
in
making
her
a
with
himself
she
will
not
manifest
the
belligerent
and
uncompanionable
spirit
which
too
often
characterizes
the
bearing
of
some
women
during
this
period
of
unfolding
life
while
it
is
true
that
the
changes
which
accompany
this
period
are
more
marked
in
woman
than
in
man
yet
when
we
remember
that
a
close
study
of
the
reproductive
nature
of
man
in
married
life
discloses
a
responsiveness
to
her
condition
and
desires
it
will
readily
be
understood
that
during
the
period
of
his
wife
gestation
his
nature
is
measurably
moderated
by
her
condition
for
in
health
the
reproductive
nature
of
man
is
responsive
to
the
promptings
of
his
wife
the
poet
wisely
says
as
unto
the
bow
the
cord
is
so
unto
the
man
is
woman
though
she
bends
him
she
obeys
him
though
she
draws
him
yet
she
follows
useless
each
without
the
other
where
existing
facts
in
any
particular
case
are
discordant
with
this
poetic
figure
the
causes
can
usually
be
found
in
an
abnormal
passion
in
the
man
or
a
measurable
absence
of
sexual
inclination
in
the
woman
frequently
caused
by
ruinous
modes
of
life
and
dress
while
human
beings
are
generally
very
different
in
this
respect
from
the
lower
animals
yet
something
of
what
these
changes
are
may
be
suggested
by
noting
the
changes
which
take
place
in
bird
life
as
the
wave
of
life
rises
to
its
crest
in
the
male
nature
every
department
of
his
being
is
aroused
to
greatest
activity
and
perfection
his
plumage
becomes
lustrous
he
sings
with
sweetest
note
in
some
of
the
animals
the
intensity
of
his
vitality
bursts
out
in
a
growth
of
great
antlers
but
when
the
mating
season
is
passed
the
plumage
fades
the
antlers
drop
off
as
the
receding
tide
of
life
sets
in
these
marked
changes
among
the
animals
are
by
no
means
paralleled
in
man
yet
there
are
semblances
or
faint
shadows
of
them
in
the
modifying
of
the
male
nature
while
such
external
and
manifest
changes
as
we
have
indicated
are
taking
place
marvelous
things
are
being
wrought
within
the
mother
body
the
ovum
or
egg
for
that
is
what
it
truly
is
after
it
has
left
the
place
where
it
matured
in
the
ovary
is
impregnated
by
the
spermatozoön
which
in
its
restless
search
for
the
ovum
presses
forward
from
the
place
where
it
was
liberated
in
the
vagina
up
through
the
womb
and
out
through
the
fallopian
tube
toward
the
ovary
or
the
ovum
may
pass
through
the
fallopian
tube
and
into
the
womb
to
await
for
a
brief
period
or
a
few
days
the
coming
of
the
sperm
or
spermatozoön
without
which
it
must
remain
incomplete
and
perish
god
might
just
as
easily
have
ordained
that
the
ovum
should
be
complete
in
itself
and
that
without
any
intervention
or
at
appointed
intervals
the
mother
should
bring
forth
her
offspring
but
there
were
reasons
why
this
should
not
be
the
begetting
and
bringing
forth
of
human
life
involves
issues
too
vast
to
be
committed
to
a
single
individual
without
a
defender
or
protector
during
this
period
when
the
mother
is
rendered
measurably
helpless
by
her
condition
would
imperil
the
safety
and
even
the
life
of
both
parent
and
child
two
must
share
the
risks
and
the
responsibilities
the
father
during
this
period
and
that
which
follows
is
to
bear
the
burdens
of
life
largely
alone
he
is
to
provide
food
and
shelter
he
is
to
be
the
guardian
and
the
defender
of
his
more
dependent
companion
should
exposure
or
peril
result
in
the
death
of
the
mother
the
child
must
not
be
left
without
a
natural
guardian
and
caretaker
this
young
life
is
too
precious
to
be
exposed
to
possible
peril
its
care
its
nurture
its
education
is
too
important
even
to
be
risked
with
a
single
parent
the
mother
might
forget
her
sucking
child
that
she
should
not
have
compassion
on
the
son
of
her
womb
and
it
was
important
that
the
child
should
then
have
another
who
is
bound
by
natural
and
moral
obligations
and
by
bonds
of
personal
interest
and
tenderest
affection
to
care
for
it
this
double
parentage
gives
the
child
four
grandparents
instead
of
two
and
eight
instead
of
four
in
this
wise
way
the
child
is
knit
to
many
in
an
obligation
to
nurture
and
care
for
it
should
necessity
arise
if
physical
mental
and
moral
infirmity
should
exist
in
the
mother
the
force
of
such
infirmity
must
be
reasonably
broken
by
a
new
stream
of
influences
which
tend
to
liberate
the
child
from
any
inheritance
of
incapacity
if
the
father
is
wicked
or
worthless
the
child
is
to
find
its
defender
and
caretaker
in
its
mother
or
should
the
mother
possess
these
bad
qualities
the
child
may
find
in
its
father
its
defense
and
help
the
life
and
of
the
child
is
so
important
that
it
must
have
two
chances
to
be
and
but
this
relation
of
interdependence
is
not
only
for
the
of
the
offspring
but
for
the
highest
physical
intellectual
and
moral
development
and
of
both
parents
parenthood
comes
not
only
to
the
mother
molding
fashioning
and
perfecting
her
in
every
department
of
her
being
but
when
intelligently
and
reverently
assumed
when
discharged
with
fidelity
and
it
has
its
priceless
endowments
for
the
father
as
well
in
view
of
the
creator
full
and
sacred
purpose
who
shall
dare
invade
or
even
lightly
assume
the
responsibilities
which
god
has
united
to
parenthood
what
god
hath
joined
together
let
not
man
put
asunder
what
intelligent
man
or
woman
shall
dare
trample
under
their
feet
all
the
sacred
relations
of
life
and
call
into
being
an
immortal
spirit
whose
temporal
and
eternal
destinies
are
to
be
affected
by
its
advent
into
a
world
that
is
waiting
to
brand
it
because
begotten
of
an
illicit
union
what
husband
or
wife
can
regard
with
dishonor
or
dare
debase
the
powers
of
reproduction
but
to
return
to
the
subject
of
the
changes
which
take
place
within
the
body
of
the
mother
during
this
period
of
wondrous
interest
when
the
spermatozoa
have
been
liberated
in
the
upper
portion
of
the
vagina
at
the
cervix
or
small
opening
which
forms
what
is
called
the
neck
of
the
womb
although
such
minute
microscopic
objects
that
when
laid
end
to
end
it
would
require
five
hundred
of
them
to
make
an
inch
in
length
yet
with
that
wonderful
activity
of
which
we
have
written
in
a
previous
chapter
they
immediately
seek
the
doorway
into
the
womb
that
mysterious
chamber
where
the
ovum
may
naturally
be
expected
to
await
their
coming
we
correctly
think
of
persons
and
not
of
things
as
possessed
of
intelligence
and
acting
in
accordance
with
reason
but
this
mysterious
natal
chamber
within
the
mother
body
appears
instinct
with
intelligence
it
seems
almost
as
though
across
its
portals
were
written
in
a
language
which
every
object
and
every
spermatozoön
might
read
the
prohibition
none
save
those
who
bear
the
gift
of
life
may
enter
or
tarry
within
these
portals
the
ovum
may
remain
for
a
period
and
the
spermatozoa
that
seek
the
ovum
may
enter
but
neither
may
tarry
unless
each
yields
itself
to
the
other
in
that
mysterious
union
which
results
in
life
apart
or
alone
after
a
brief
period
they
must
alike
be
cast
out
no
idler
may
tarry
there
but
that
semblance
to
innate
intelligence
which
rejects
or
casts
out
any
incomplete
part
as
a
foreign
substance
accords
a
hearty
welcome
to
the
ovum
that
has
been
quickened
into
a
new
life
by
the
entrance
of
a
spermatozoön
no
mother
ever
embraced
her
newborn
child
more
lovingly
or
regarded
it
with
greater
tenderness
than
the
womb
receives
the
quickened
ovum
when
the
ovum
is
quickened
every
fibre
of
being
thrills
with
a
new
purpose
a
royal
place
is
speedily
prepared
for
the
safety
nurture
and
development
of
the
ovum
the
entire
nature
of
the
mother
now
centres
upon
the
accomplishment
of
a
special
work
that
of
developing
and
bringing
forth
the
new
life
begotten
within
great
changes
are
to
be
wrought
not
only
in
the
ovum
but
the
enlarging
life
and
new
necessities
are
to
be
met
by
corresponding
changes
in
the
womb
itself
not
only
is
the
minute
speck
of
life
which
is
laid
within
this
human
cradle
to
develop
into
a
human
being
but
the
cradle
is
to
enlarge
with
the
growth
of
its
occupant
and
respond
to
the
varying
needs
of
the
unfolding
and
developing
body
within
it
will
require
the
aid
of
a
microscope
to
discover
and
observe
the
object
of
our
search
and
study
the
egg
of
the
bird
bears
some
proportion
to
the
size
of
its
producer
for
in
them
is
stored
up
the
nourishment
which
is
to
maintain
the
unfolding
life
that
can
be
fed
in
no
other
way
until
it
has
reached
an
advanced
stage
of
maturity
and
has
broken
its
shell
and
emerged
into
the
outer
world
the
human
egg
is
so
small
that
it
would
require
two
hundred
and
forty
of
them
laid
side
by
side
to
make
one
inch
in
length
they
contain
the
nourishment
which
is
to
foster
this
minute
beginning
of
human
life
for
a
brief
period
after
which
it
is
to
derive
all
its
nourishment
from
the
mother
her
food
is
to
furnish
the
material
for
its
upbuilding
its
blood
is
to
flow
from
her
heart
the
egg
of
the
bird
is
encased
in
a
porous
covering
through
which
pure
air
with
its
transforming
power
is
to
find
its
way
to
the
developing
life
within
but
this
human
egg
and
the
life
which
it
is
designed
to
unfold
must
owe
all
to
its
mother
her
lungs
must
impart
the
oxygen
it
needs
and
her
body
must
minister
to
every
function
of
the
body
of
the

until
after
a
period
of
months
when
it
shall
have
reached
that
stage
of
development
when
it
is
prepared
to
enter
upon
its
own
independent
life
in
the
outer

this
minute
germ
of
human
life
this

so
small
that
a
thousand
could
be
laid
upon
a
piece
this
atom
which
under
the
microscope
shows
a
speck
of
oil
and

which
in
the
course
of
a

brief
months
is
to
constitute
a
complex
human
organism
with
all
the
perfected
parts
and
wonderful
adjustment
of

contains
the
elements
of
a

soul
embodied
in

here
are
all
the
elements
which
are
to
make
the
successful

the

the
orator
or
the
statesman
ingrained
in
these
forming

may
be
scrofula
consumption
or

here
already
are
the
inheritances
which
are
to
determine
whether
this
being
shall
be
temperate
or
intemperate
chaste
or
licentious
the
moral
nature
has
already
received
that
bent
which
will
incline
it
to
reach
out
after
god
and
heaven
and
holy
things
or
which
will
incline
it
downward
to
all
that
is
base
destructive
and
that
tends
to
death
the
history
of
this
immortal
being
is
already
measurably
outlined
in
the
past
life
of
the
father
and
the
mother
what
they
have
been
in
their
thought
in
their
character
in
their
being
that
their
child
is
largely
to
become
this
outline
is
now
subjected
to
modifications
by
the
thought
and
life
of
the
mother
during
the
few
months
while
the
body
of
her
child
is
being
unfolded
fashioned
and
developed
beneath
and
so
close
to
her
own
heart
during
these
months
her
life
is
to
tell
both
upon
the
body
and
the
soul
of
her
child
during
the
brief
period
while
the
germ
within
the
fertilized
egg
is
being
nourished
by
the
vitellus
or
yolk
of
the
egg
great
changes
are
taking
place
in
the
soft
and
delicate
linings
which
surround
it
within
the
womb
while
of
course
the
greatest
changes
which
take
place
during
the
period
of
gestation
are
chiefly
within
the
ovum
or
egg
yet
those
which
take
place
in
the
body
of
the
mother
herself
are
more
manifest
and
scarcely
less
marvelous
the
mucous
membrane
within
the
walls
of
this
enclosure
begins
to
thicken
the
small
vessels
which
compose
the
structure
of
the
inner
surface
begin
to
multiply
enlarge
and
lengthen
until
they
are
manifest
to
the
unaided
eye
this
soft
velvety
lining
becomes
thick
and
rich
but
loses
none
of
its
softness
and
delicacy
every
preparation
is
speedily
made
and
the
fertilized
egg
finds
lodgment
in
the
thin
delicate
folds
of
the
membrane
in
the
upper
central
portion
or
dome
of
the
womb
the
folds
begin
to
grow
about
the
egg
partially
enclosing
it
and
shutting
it
off
from
the
general
cavity
of
the
womb
at
last
the
borders
of
this
growing
envelope
meet
and
form
a
complete
and
distinct
enclosure
this
thin
transparent
tissue
which
constitutes
a
living
envelope
or
sac
shuts
off
the
egg
or
growing
embryo
from
the
rest
of
the
cavity
of
the
womb
which
its
increasing
proportions
are
soon
completely
to
fill
the
original
membranous
lining
which
covers
the
entire
interior
of
the
womb
and
which
has
now
become
thickened
or
tumefied
as
medical
men
say
is
technically
called
the
decidua
vera
while
that
portion
of
the
membrane
which
forms
the
sac
that
surrounds
and
encloses
the
egg
is
called
the
decidua
reflex
these
are
known
as
decidua
which
means
not
permanent
a
word
applied
to
those
things
in
nature
which
after
a
period
drop
away
as
leaves
teeth
and
horns
which
are
shed
or
fall
off
so
the
decidua
reflex
is
to
pass
away
with
the
birth
and
the
decidua
vera
is
to
change
back
again
into
its
normal
condition
the
egg
which
during
this
period
has
considerably
enlarged
begins
to
throw
out
upon
all
sides
threadlike
tissues
by
which
this
germ
of
life
becomes
attached
to
and
grows
into
the
upon
which
it
is
engrafted
it
is
through
these
filaments
that
the
fluids
which
are
to
nourish
and
develop
this
unfolding
life
are
imparted
from
the
mother
and
received
by
the
embryo
as
the
attachment
between
the
sac
which
encloses
the
egg
more
firmly
and
securely
adheres
to
the
walls
of
the
womb
the
filaments
which
had
formed
upon
all
sides
of
the
enclosing
sac
begin
to
disappear
except
upon
the
side
in
contact
with
the
womb
upon
that
side
they
become
more
pronounced
and
in
the
third
month
the
permanent
attachment
known
as
the
placenta
through
which
the
embryo
is
to
receive
its
increasing
supply
of
nourishment
from
the
body
of
the
mother
begins
to
be
formed
the
placenta
is
circular
in
shape
from
one
to
two
inches
in
thickness
in
its
thickest
part
and
about
six
or
eight
inches
in
diameter
it
forms
the
temporary
medium
of
communication
between
the
life
of
the
mother
and
that
of
the
child
and
properly
speaking
is
not
a
part
of
either
it
is
formed
for
a
temporary
use
which
terminates
with
the
birth
of
the
child
and
at
that
time
the
placenta
the
umbilical
or
navel
cord
and
the
membrane
we
have
named
constitute
what
is
called
the
afterbirth
the
placenta
is
a
flat
soft
disk
which
is
attached
to
the
walls
of
the
womb
connecting
the
embryo
by
the
navel
cord
through
which
it
respires
or
breathes
and
receives
nourishment
and
discharges
the
particles
of
matter
it
is
through
this
attachment
or
cord
that
an
intimate
connection
is
established
between
the
growing
life
of
the
ovum
and
the
currents
of
life
which
flow
in
the
mother
body
through
this
placentic
cord
the
embryo
receives
oxygen
and
all
the
elements
necessary
for
its
growth
upon
the
one
hand
while
upon
the
other
it
also
transfers
to
the
body
of
the
mother
the
carbonic
acid
gas
and
other
impurities
which
in
the
process
of
life
are
necessary
to
be
thrown
off
chapter
xv
the
changes
which
precede
attend
and
follow
conception
and
childbirth
but
while
these
changes
have
been
taking
place
within
the
womb
itself
and
the
decidua
or
thickened
membrane
has
been
forming
about
this
developing
germ
of
life
let
us
consider
some
of
the
changes
which
have
taken
place
within
the
ovum
itself
if
observant
when
opening
a
egg
the
observer
will
notice
that
the
yolk
is
covered
by
a
very
thin
membrane
which
encloses
and
separates
it
from
the
other
portion
of
the
egg
and
holds
it
in
its
rounded
form
the
membrane
is
exceedingly
delicate
but
sufficiently
thick
and
strong
to
serve
its
intended
purpose
now
the
human
ovum
or
egg
consists
of
a
vitellus
or
yolk
which
is
covered
by
a
similar
membrane
known
as
the
vitelline
when
this
ovum
or
egg
has
been
fertilized
or
impregnated
remarkable
changes
take
place
this
vitellus
or
yolk
undergoes
a
series
of
segmentation
or
dividings
which
are
known
as
spontaneous
segmentation
the
single
minute
yolk
divides
itself
into
two
smaller
balls
or
segments
these
again
subdivide
into
four
these
four
subdivide
into
eight
the
eight
into
sixteen
and
so
on
resulting
in
the
rearrangement
of
the
yolk
into
a
finely
divided
granular
mass
while
this
division
is
in
process
the
divided
parts
arrange
themselves
orderly
about
the
inner
surface
of
the
vitelline
or
yolk
membrane
with
the
minute
microscopic
spaces
between
filled
with
a
transparent
fluid
while
these
cells
have
been
multiplying
and
become
so
abundant
as
to
be
flattened
against
the
internal
surface
of
the
yolk
membrane
they
have
developed
into
true
animal
cells
the
edges
of
these
cells
where
they
come
in
contact
with
each
other
form
a
continuous
organized
membrane
which
lies
just
within
the
yolk
membrane
this
membrane
is
called
the
blastodermic
membrane
this
new
membrane
formed
within
the
sac
which
originally
enclosed
the
yolk
of
the
ovum
now
divides
or
separates
itself
into
two
distinct
layers
known
as
the
outer
and
inner
blastodermic
membranes
also
called
epiblast
and
hypoblast
the
egg
at
this
stage
of
development
presents
the
appearance
of
a
small
round
sac
the
walls
of
which
consist
of
three
layers
each
succeeding
layer
lying
immediately
within
and
in
contact
with
the
other
which
encloses
it
the
outer
one
of
the
three
is
the
primitive
yolk
sac
the
second
is
the
outer
layer
of
the
blastodermic
membrane
and
the
third
the
inner
layer
while
the
interior
cavity
of
the
egg
is
filled
by
the
transparent
fluid
previously
mentioned
in
order
to
understand
the
beginnings
of
life
it
is
important
to
have
a
clear
conception
of
these
different
sacs
for
these
two
membranes
lying
within
the
yolk
sac
and
together
known
as
the
blastodermic
membrane
and
separately
as
the
outer
and
inner
layers
of
the
blastodermic
membrane
contain
the
anatomical
elements
from
which
the
organized
being
with
its
body
is
to
grow
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
these
two
blastodermic
membranes
are
the
body
of
the
embryo
which
is
to
develop
into
the
physical
man
the
noting
of
this
division
into
two
separate
layers
is
important
for
the
outer
one
develops
into
the
skin
spinal
cord
muscles
and
bone
while
from
the
inner
layer
is
formed
the
intestinal
canal
and
the
organs
of
vegetative
life
between
these
two
blastodermic
membranes
other
minute
tissues
are
formed
the
office
and
end
of
which
are
not
so
fully
understood
and
the
consideration
of
which
would
lead
us
into
intricacies
beyond
our
present
purpose
the
first
visible
sign
of
the
organic
structure
of
the
human
form
is
discovered
as
it
takes
shape
upon
the
exterior
wall
of
the
blastodermic
membrane
known
as
the
embryonic
spot
and
known
also
as
the
primitive
trace
or
furrow
it
is
supposed
that
from
this
is
formed
the
spinal
canal
with
the
dorsal
plate
upon
either
side
from
which
springs
the
framework
of
the
bony
structure
and
at
one
end
of
which
is
the
large
rounded
cavity
which
forms
the
receptacle
for
the
brain
and
the
medulla
oblongata
or
the
upper
cranial
portion
of
the
spinal
cord
which
is
to
control
respiration
and
at
the
other
extremity
of
which
in
a
later
stage
will
sprout
or
grow
the
legs
and
feet
without
complicating
the
subject
too
much
for
the
clear
understanding
of
the
ordinary
reader
by
undertaking
to
explain
minute
changes
which
are
very
interesting
to
specialists
but
likely
to
detract
from
its
interest
and
value
to
the
ordinary
reader
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
in
the
course
of
a
brief
period
the
embryo
which
has
grown
mainly
from
the
two
blastodermic
membranes
which
we
have
described
and
is
attached
to
the
walls
of
the
womb
by
the
placenta
and
cord
which
carries
the
blood
and
from
the
body
of
the
mother
to
the
growing
body
of
the
child
within
is
at
this
period
of
its
development
surrounded
and
enclosed
by
a
number
of
membranes
the
outer
one
of
these
is
the
inner
lining
of
the
womb
itself
known
as
the
decidua
vera
within
this
is
the
decidua
reflex
the
membrane
of
the
womb
which
extended
itself
and
grew
around
the
ovum
completely
enclosing
it
the
third
is
the
chorion
forming
the
outer
membrane
which
encloses
the
fetus
and
within
which
is
the
amnion
or
innermost
membrane
which
surrounds
the
fetus
and
between
which
is
another
membrane
called
the
allantois
the
amnion
which
is
the
innermost
of
the
membranes
surrounding
the
fetus
seemingly
has
a
special
office
which
is
to
secrete
the
fluid
technically
called
the
amniotic
this
fluid
is
popularly
known
as
the
waters
this
secretion
performs
several
important
offices
it
protects
the
fetus
from
any
local
pressure
or
blow
and
so
distributes
any
pressure
as
to
enable
all
the
parts
to
grow
without
danger
of
distortion
and
deformity
it
also
affords
the
fetus
greater
freedom
of
motion
and
protects
the
womb
and
other
parts
from
injuries
which
might
otherwise
be
inflicted
by
the
fetus
after
quickening
within
this
fluid
the
fetus
floats
during
its
formative
period
and
when
the
time
of
birth
comes
the
breaking
of
the
sac
which
contains
this
fluid
enables
it
to
flow
out
lubricating
the
parts
or
channel
through
which
the
newly
formed
being
is
to
pass
in
its
exit
into
the
outer
world
the
importance
of
this
fluid
in
this
latter
office
is
of
great
moment
when
the
sac
breaks
and
the
waters
flow
away
too
much
in
advance
of
the
birth
of
the
child
there
generally
occur
the
inconveniences
that
attend
what
is
called
a
dry
birth
as
already
mentioned
in
a
previous
paragraph
during
the
first
weeks
of
growth
the
embryo
is
nourished
the
same
as
the
young
chick
within
the
egg
by
the
yolk
in
which
its
earliest
nourishment
has
been
stored
soon
the
delicate
union
is
formed
between
the
chorion
by
the
gathering
and
multiplication
of
the
villi
or
minute
membranes
which
gather
into
a
compact
mass
and
adhere
to
the
adjacent
portion
of
the
womb
this
formation
is
known
as
the
placenta
previously
described
which
is
constituted
of
two
portions
the
maternal
side
which
is
toward
the
walls
of
the
womb
and
the
fetal
side
which
is
toward
the
growing
fetus
upon
the
inner
side
the
placenta
is
united
with
the
fetus
by
two
arteries
which
are
wrapped
around
the
one
vein
which
together
unite
with
the
body
of
the
placenta
through
these
the
flow
and
while
the
circulation
between
the
bodies
of
mother
and
child
are
not
direct
or
uninterrupted
for
the
fetus
has
its
own
measurably
independent
circulation
yet
from
the
time
the
connection
is
formed
until
the
cord
is
severed
at
birth
the
fetus
derives
all
its
nourishment
from
the
mother
let
us
turn
now
to
note
the
rapid
changes
which
take
place
within
the
germ
or
egg
from
the
time
of
its
impregnation
to
the
hour
of
the
birth
of
the
child
the
changes
although
seemingly
very
minute
at
first
are
nevertheless
very
rapid
from
the
beginning
to
the
period
of
maturity
and
birth
the
following
account
taken
from
plain
talks
on
avoided
subjects
by
henry
guernsey
constitutes
a
goodly
portion
of
the
introductory
chapter
of
that
excellent
little
book
and
presents
the
matter
in
the
intelligible
and
impressive
manner
we
desire
for
this
place
and
is
quoted
in
full
by
permission
the
first
indication
of
formation
that
is
possible
to
discover
even
by
the
help
of
the
microscope
consists
of
an
oblong
figure
obtuse
at
one
extremity
swollen
in
the
middle
at
the
other
extremity
the
rudimentary
embryo
is
slightly
curved
forward
is
of
a
color
of
a
gelatinous
consistence
from
two
to
four
lines
long
and
weighs
one
or
two
grains
a
slight
depression
representing
the
neck
enables
us
to
distinguish
the
head
the
body
is
marked
by
a
swollen
centre
but
there
are
as
yet
no
traces
of
the
extremities
so
much
can
be
observed
about
the
end
of
the
third
week
after
conception
at
about
the
the
embryo
presents
more
distinctions
the
head
is
very
large
in
proportion
to
the
rest
of
the
body
the
eyes
are
represented
by
two
black
spots
and
the
upper
extremities
by
small
protuberances
on
the
sides
of
the
trunk
the
embryo
at
this
stage
is
nearly
of
an
inch
in
length
and
weighs
about
fifteen
grains
the
lower
extremities
now
begin
to
appear
in
the
shape
of
two
minute
rounded
tubercles
till
about
this
time
a
straight
artery
has
been
observed
to
beat
with
the
regularity
of
the
pulse
but
now
it
appears
doubled
somewhat
into
the
shape
of
an
adult
heart
although
as
yet
it
has
but
one
auricle
and
one
ventricle
as
time
advances
we
find
the
perfect
heart
with
its
two
ventricles
and
two
auricles
all
developed
from
the
original
straight
artery
at
this
period
the
lungs
appear
to
exist
in
five
or
six
different
lobes
and
we
can
barely
distinguish
the
bronchial
tubes
about
the
same
time
the
ears
and
face
are
distinctly
outlined
and
after
awhile
the
nose
is
also
faintly
and
imperfectly
perceived
at
about
the
little
bony
deposit
is
found
in
the
lower
jaw
the
kidneys
now
begin
to
be
formed
and
a
little
later
the
genital
organs
the
embryo
averages
one
inch
in
length
at
the
rudiments
of
the
extremities
become
more
prominent
the
forearm
and
hand
can
be
distinguished
but
not
the
arm
above
the
elbow
the
hand
is
larger
than
the
forearm
but
is
not
supplied
with
fingers
the
sex
can
not
yet
be
determined
the
length
of
the
embryo
is
from
one
inch
and
a
half
to
two
inches
and
it
weighs
from
three
to
five
drachms
the
eyes
are
discernible
but
still
uncovered
by
the
rudimentary
lids
the
nose
forms
an
obtuse
eminence
the
nostrils
are
rounded
and
separated
the
mouth
is
gaping
and
the
epidermis
can
be
distinguished
from
the
true
skin
at
the
embryo
is
from
one
and
a
half
to
two
and
a
half
inches
long
and
its
weight
is
from
one
ounce
to
an
ounce
and
a
half
the
eyelids
are
more
developed
and
descend
in
front
of
the
eyes
the
mouth
begins
to
be
closed
by
the
development
of
the
lips
the
walls
of
the
chest
are
more
completely
formed
so
that
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
see
the
movements
of
the
heart
the
fingers
become
distinct
and
the
toes
appear
as
small
projections
webbed
together
like
a
frog
foot
at
about
this
period
the
sexual
organs
show
their
development
as
follows
on
each
side
of
the
urinary
locality
an
oblong
fold
becomes
distinguishable
in
course
of
progress
if
these
folds
remain
separate
a
little
tubercle
forms
in
the
anterior
commissure
which
becomes
the
clitoris
the
nymphæ
develop
the
urethra
forms
between
them
and
the
female
sex
is
determined
if
on
the
other
hand
these
folds
unite
into
a
rounded
projection
the
scrotum
is
formed
the
little
tubercle
above
becomes
the
penis
and
hence
the
male
sex
the
testicles
forming
within
the
body
descend
later
into
the
scrotum
and
organs
similar
to
them
their
counterparts
form
in
the
females
and
are
called
ovaries
these
ovaries
are
found
attached
to
an
organ
called
the
womb
and
this
again
is
united
with
the
vagina
which
leads
downwards
and
outwards
between
the
labia
majora
or
larger
lips
at
the
end
of
the
the
weight
of
the
embryo
is
from
three
to
four
ounces
and
its
length
from
four
to
five
inches
the
eyeballs
are
seen
through
the
lids
the
pupils
of
the
eyes
are
discernible
the
forehead
nose
and
lips
can
be
clearly
distinguished
the
resemble
thin
membranous
plates
the
skin
shows
more
firmness
but
is
still
thin
and
transparent
the
sex
can
now
be
fully
determined
at
the
end
of
the
the
product
of
conception
is
no
longer
called
an
embryo
but
a
fetus
the
body
is
from
six
to
eight
inches
in
length
and
weighs
six
or
seven
ounces
a
few
little
white
hairs
are
seen
scattered
over
the
scalp
the
development
of
the
face
is
still
imperfect
the
eyes
are
now
closed
by
their
lids
the
nostrils
are
the
mouth
is
shut
in
by
the
lips
and
the
sex
is
still
more
sharply
defined
the
tongue
may
be
observed
far
back
in
the
mouth
and
the
lower
part
of
the
face
is
rounded
off
by
what
a
little
later
will
be
a
chin
the
movements
of
the
fetus
are
by
this
time
plainly
felt
by
the
mother
and
if
born
at
this
time
it
may
live
several
months
at
the
end
of
the
the
body
of
the
fetus
is
from
seven
to
nine
inches
long
and
weighs
from
eight
to
eleven
ounces
the
skin
has
a
fairer
appearance
and
more
consistence
the
eyes
can
no
longer
be
distinguished
through
the
lids
owing
to
the
increased
thickness
of
the
latter
the
head
heart
and
kidneys
are
large
and
at
the
end
of
the
the
fetus
is
from
eleven
to
twelve
and
a
half
inches
in
length
and
weighs
about
sixteen
ounces
more
or
less
the
hair
upon
the
scalp
is
thicker
and
longer
the
eyes
remain
closed
and
very
delicate
hairs
may
be
seen
upon
the
margins
of
the
eyelids
and
upon
the
eyebrows
the
nails
are
solid
the
scrotum
small
and
empty
the
surface
of
the
skin
appears
wrinkled
but
the
dermis
may
be
distinguished
from
the
epidermis
the
liver
is
large
and
red
and
the
contains
fluid
at
the
end
of
the
the
length
of
the
fetus
is
from
twelve
and
a
half
to
fourteen
inches
its
weight
is
about
ounces
and
it
is
both
and
in
all
its
parts
the
bones
of
the
cranium
hitherto
quite
flat
now
appear
a
little
arched
and
as
the
process
of
ossification
goes
on
the
arching
increases
until
the
vault
is
quite
complete
the
brain
presents
greater
firmness
and
the
eyelids
are
opened
the
skin
is
much
firmer
and
red
the
contains
bile
at
the
end
of
the
the
fetus
seems
to
thicken
up
rather
than
to
increase
in
length
since
it
is
only
from
sixteen
to
eighteen
inches
long
while
its
weight
increases
from
four
to
five
pounds
the
skin
is
red
and
characterized
at
this
period
by
a
fine
downy
covering
over
which
is
spread
a
quantity
of
thick
viscous
matter
called
the
sebaceous
coat
which
has
been
forming
since
the
latter
part
of
the
fifth
month
the
lower
jaw
has
now
become
as
long
as
the
upper
one
and
in
the
male
the
left
testicle
may
be
found
in
the
scrotum
convolutions
appear
in
the
brain
structure
at
the
anxious
time
of
parturition
or
birth
has
arrived
the
fetus
is
from
nineteen
to
inches
in
length
and
weighs
on
an
average
from
six
to
eight
pounds
children
at
birth
sometimes
weigh
as
much
as
fourteen
pounds
but
such
extremes
are
very
rare
at
this
period
the
white
and
gray
matter
of
the
brain
are
distinct
and
the
convolutions
are
well
marked
the
nails
assume
a
horny
consistence
hair
upon
the
head
is
more
or
less
abundant
the
testes
are
in
the
scrotum
and
the
entire
external
genital
organs
of
both
male
and
female
are
well
formed
how
wonderfully
and
how
instructively
are
all
organs
in
the
animal
body
disposed
and
arranged
in
the
highest
place
we
find
the
brain
to
govern
and
rule
over
all
below
it
is
the
first
organ
formed
and
in
an
orderly
life
should
control
all
the
others
next
in
order
and
importance
are
the
heart
and
lungs
which
put
into
motion
all
other
parts
and
enable
the
animal
frame
to
continue
in
motion
so
each
and
every
organ
is
developed
in
its
proper
order
all
to
obey
the
commands
of
the
first
and
most
important
the
brain
the
seat
of
the
reason
and
the
will
happy
are
they
of
either
sex
who
will
govern
themselves
by
a
pure
enlightened
reason
and
a
pure
affectionate
will
while
we
may
note
the
various
stages
of
change
and
progress
yet
to
the
thoughtful
student
there
lies
back
of
all
these
outer
manifestations
a
hidden
life
a
divine
unfolding
of
the
human
body
which
is
mysterious
and
while
we
know
something
of
what
takes
place
yet
the
declaration
of
the
book
of
ecclesiastes
is
impressively
true
thou
knowest
not
what
is
the
way
of
the
spirit
nor
how
the
bones
do
grow
in
the
womb
of
her
that
is
with
child
all
who
study
it
thoughtfully
and
reverently
can
exclaim
with
david
i
am
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
marvelous
are
thy
works
and
that
my
soul
knoweth
right
well
my
substance
was
not
hid
from
thee
when
i
was
made
in
secret
and
curiously
wrought
in
the
lowest
parts
of
the
earth
thine
eyes
did
see
my
substance
yet
being
imperfect
and
in
thy
book
all
my
members
were
written
which
in
continuance
were
fashioned
when
as
yet
there
was
none
of
them
let
us
turn
now
to
the
mother
who
has
nourished
and
who
is
about
to
bring
into
the
world
the
body
of
an
immortal
being
some
of
the
changes
most
easily
noted
in
the
body
of
the
mother
occur
as
she
reaches
the
period
when
approaching
maturity
has
prepared
the
body
of
the
child
for
an
early
entrance
into
the
outer
world
marvelous
as
are
the
less
noticeable
changes
which
have
earlier
taken
place
the
time
has
now
come
when
others
which
are
more
marked
are
soon
to
manifest
themselves
several
days
prior
to
the
event
there
is
a
dropping
or
subsidence
of
the
womb
this
is
preparatory
to
the
distention
and
enlargement
of
the
vagina
through
which
the
exit
is
to
be
made
the
stomach
and
lungs
are
relieved
of
pressure
the
mother
feels
more
easy
is
more
inclined
to
move
about
breathes
more
freely
and
the
sense
of
oppression
which
formerly
caused
her
to
desire
inaction
passes
away
and
providence
thus
fits
her
to
make
such
necessary
preparations
as
are
important
in
view
of
the
event
which
is
soon
to
take
place
as
the
days
approach
the
external
parts
give
indication
of
the
distention
and
enlargement
which
has
taken
place
in
the
vagina
and
the
preparations
which
nature
is
making
for
the
more
easy
exit
of
the
life
which
has
developed
within
the
entire
physical
nature
of
the
mother
is
in
a
state
of
preparation
for
the
great
event
a
large
quantity
of
blood
is
being
sent
to
the
breasts
the
lacteals
are
developing
and
the
preparation
is
being
completed
for
the
secretion
of
milk
so
that
there
may
be
no
lack
when
the
little
stranger
arrives
one
of
the
earliest
indications
that
the
event
is
about
to
take
place
is
the
discharge
of
the
small
plug
of
mucus
which
has
served
to
hermetically
seal
the
neck
of
the
womb
against
the
entrance
of
any
foreign
substance
but
its
office
or
work
is
now
completed
the
cervix
or
neck
of
the
womb
enlarges
and
this
little
plug
popularly
known
as
the
show
passes
away
with
some
streaks
of
blood
while
the
neck
of
the
womb
the
vaginal
passage
and
the
external
parts
have
greatly
enlarged
the
womb
itself
is
beginning
to
contract
preparatory
to
the
expulsion
of
that
which
it
has
fostered
and
nourished
for
a
period
of
about
nine
months
the
earliest
premonition
that
these
contractions
are
taking
place
is
found
in
the
grinding
pains
which
come
at
irregular
intervals
sometimes
a
couple
of
hours
apart
or
only
separated
by
a
half
hour
or
even
a
shorter
period
these
contractions
of
the
abdominal
muscles
are
soon
followed
by
the
true
which
come
at
more
regular
intervals
these
grinding
pains
are
felt
in
the
back
and
loins
the
contractions
rise
to
a
certain
pitch
of
intensity
and
then
as
gradually
abate
usually
as
the
regular
begin
the
fluid
contained
in
the
amniotic
sac
and
within
which
the
child
has
floated
during
its
period
of
growth
is
now
liberated
by
the
breaking
of
the
sac
flows
through
the
vaginal
passage
lubricating
the
parts
and
preparing
all
for
an
easy
exit
of
the
body
of
the
infant
into
the
outer
world
when
the
presentation
is
normal
the
head
comes
first
and
usually
in
a
period
varying
from
a
few
minutes
to
a
few
hours
the
child
is
born
in
exceptional
cases
the
labor
may
be
extended
over
a
day
or
more
but
such
cases
are
relatively
rare
the
apprehensions
of
dangers
which
associate
themselves
in
the
minds
of
many
with
childbirth
are
not
often
realized
if
the
parts
are
not
diseased
and
the
mother
is
in
good
health
and
the
laws
of
the
unfolding
life
have
been
carefully
observed
there
is
little
peril
although
generally
considerable
pain
there
are
many
physicians
who
have
attended
hundreds
of
women
in
confinement
who
have
never
lost
but
an
exceptional
case
or
two
the
extreme
pain
endured
by
many
women
is
largely
due
to
the
lack
of
that
knowledge
which
would
have
enabled
the
mother
to
approach
this
period
with
but
little
apprehension
and
to
have
passed
through
the
period
of
parturition
or
childbirth
with
but
slight
inconvenience
and
pain
while
the
perils
may
be
greatly
reduced
and
the
pains
greatly
diminished
it
is
nevertheless
a
period
of
wonderful
revolution
throughout
the
entire
physical
nature
of
the
mother
the
blood
which
flowed
from
her
heart
to
nourish
and
foster
the
growing
body
of
her
child
is
now
turned
in
other
directions
and
the
fountains
at
which
the
child
is
to
receive
its
food
and
its
strength
begin
to
flow
with
their
richness
of
currents
after
the
placenta
and
the
sacs
which
enclosed
the
fetus
which
together
constitute
what
is
known
as
the
afterbirth
have
passed
away
the
recuperating
and
renewing
powers
with
which
god
has
so
wonderfully
endowed
the
body
of
the
mother
beyond
that
of
the
father
become
active
the
muscular
tissues
of
the
womb
vagina
and
the
external
parts
at
once
begin
to
contract
and
the
entire
nature
of
the
mother
begins
to
adjust
itself
to
the
new
relations
of
her
child
to
her
own
body
and
the
necessities
of
nourishing
and
guarding
it
upon
the
external
portion
of
her
body
rather
than
within
that
mysterious
chamber
which
god
prepared
for
its
beginning
and
the
earliest
unfoldings
of
its
infant
life
when
the
child
is
born
into
the
world
its
body
also
undergoes
a
wonderful
revolution
then
for
the
first
time
its
heart
takes
up
its
own
independent
action
air
for
the
first
time
enters
the
cells
of
the
lungs
and
with
the
early
shock
if
it
might
so
be
called
of
taking
its
first
breath
the
child
usually
utters
its
first
cries
during
the
period
of
its
fetal
life

received
only
so
much
blood
as
was
necessary
for

with

they
expand
and
receive
the
inflowing
of
the

from
the

side
of
the

this
involves
the
opening
of

passages

the
closing
of

the

of
a

of
transformations

are
early
to
take
place
the

which
have
hitherto
received
the

of

from

the

and

of
the
mother
now
assume
a
new
relation
to
the
independent
body
of
the
newborn
child
some
of
these
ducts
and
arteries
soon
entirely
close
and
in
some
instances
degenerate
into
impervious
cords
with
new
and
important
offices
some
are
transformed
into
true
ligaments
while
others
remain
pervious
now
that
the
primitive
purposes
of
some
of
these
parts
have
been
fulfilled
the
parts
themselves
disappear
while
still
other

take
upon
themselves
new

when
the

at
the
end
of
about
days
after
the
conception
or
what
under
ordinary
conditions
would
have
been
the
tenth

period
the
days
are

the
expectant
mother
is
usually
delivered
of
her
child
the
day
when
the
indications
are
that
the
child
is
to
be
born
is
always
one
of
great
anxiety
but
need
not
be
one
of
apprehension
or
fear
where
the
laws
of
health
have
been
observed
there
is
no
cause
for
apprehension
with
the
birth
of
the
first
child
the
labor
is
oftentimes
somewhat
more
prolonged
and
attended
with
more
pain
but
the
are
usually
not
considerable
generally
the
pains
which
precede
the
birth
diminish
with
each
succeeding
confinement
but
the
increase
in
a
similar
manner
where
the
mother
has
made
intelligent
preparation
for
this
great
event
the
child
may
be
and
generally
is
born
without
the
actual
assistance
of
the
doctor
an
intelligent
nurse
would
be
in
position
to
render
every
needed
assistance
but
the
presence
of
a
physician
always
brings
such
added
ease
to
the
mind
of
the
mother
by
removing
all
unnecessary
risks
that
it
is
always
desirable
that
the
physician
should
have
been
apprised
in
advance
notified
promptly
and
be
on
hand
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
commence
this
is
especially
important
when
it
is
the
first
child
if
the
labor
should
be
short
and
the
birth
take
place
before
the
arrival
of
the
physician
the
nurse
or
attendant
should
be
careful
to
see
that
the
cord
is
not
wound
about
the
neck
of
the
child
but
placed
free
and
the
child
with
its
head
in
position
so
that
it
can
breathe
naturally
and
with
its
body
warmly
covered
when
the
pulsing
in
the
cord
has
ceased
and
the
child
has
cried
vigorously
any
nurse
who
has
been
present
at
previous
confinements
who
is
intelligent
and
capable
would
be
able
to
sever
the
cord
after
having
made
the
necessary
bindings
upon
it
indeed
some
authorities
contend
that
when
the
pulsing
has
the
cord
may
be
severed
without
any
tying

the
ends

usually
as
the

is
ushered
into
the
world
it
sets
up
a
lusty
cry
indicating
that
respiration
is
established
crying
is
not
essential
as
some
authors
claim
and
the
prompt
covering
usually
causes
it
to
desist
if
it
does
not

following

no

tying
is
done
in
order
to
prevent
excessive
bleeding
but
whether
to
tie
the
ends
of
the
severed
placentic
cord
or
not
is
a
matter
which
should
be
left
wholly
to
the
attendant
doctor
it
is
well
for
the
young
husband
to
be
intelligent
and
along
these
and
kindred
lines
but
if
he
employs
a
physician
he
should
accept
the
physician
judgment
and
have
his
instructions
followed
if
he
is
not
satisfied
with
the
doctor
whom
he
has
employed
but
sees
fit
to
change
for
one
whose
opinions
harmonize
more
closely
with
his
own
that
is
a
matter
for
the
husband
own
judgment
but
the
physician
who
is
employed
should
always
be
supreme
and
left
without
interference
or
dictation
the
doctor
in
charge
must
have
absolute
control
in
a
room
he
should
direct
and
not
be
dictated
to
if
the
husband
is
intelligent
enters
into
the
sympathies
of
his
wife
and
has
her
confidence
if
the
physician
consents
as
he
doubtless
will
it
seems
quite
natural
that
he
should
desire
to
be
present
with
his
wife
in
this
trying
experience
of
her
life
if
he
understands
the
nature
of
the
experience
through
which
she
is
called
upon
to
pass
his
sympathy
will
be
helpful
to
his
wife
and
if
nature
has
endowed
him
with
any
of
the
qualifications
of
a
good
nurse
he
can
be
of
assistance
to
the
doctor
where
the
husband
is
without
intelligence
is
nervous
and
exerts
a
depressing
influence
upon
his
wife
his
absence
may
be
more
helpful
than
his
presence
if
the
husband
is
intelligent
and
sympathetic
it
seems
to
us
that
he
could
not
but
desire
to
be
with
his
wife
but
where
he
is
wholly
disqualified
his
physician
should
not
hesitate
to
express
his
judgment
and
preference
in
this
matter
the
presence
of
a
physician
is
always
to
be
preferred
in
order
to
determine
the
presentation
sever
the
cord
and
look
carefully
after
the
afterbirth
the
normal
presentation
is
of
the
head
foremost
where
the
inexperienced
young
husband
is
in
an
extremity
and
finds
himself
alone
at
the
hour
of
delivery
he
should
expect
as
is
most
likely
that
everything
will
move
along
normally
and
he
needs
to
be
especially
guarded
only
upon
three
points
when
the
head
is
born
see
that
the
navel
cord
is
not
twisted
around
the
child
neck
if
this
should
be
the
case
it
can
easily
be
slightly
loosened
and
then
slipped
over
the
child
head
otherwise
the
pressure
of
this
tightened
ligature
would
prevent
its
breathing
and
would
result
in
strangulation
in
an
case
the
cord
could
easily
be
tied
in
two
places
a
couple
of
inches
apart
and
cut
between
them
this
should
be
done
by
an
experienced
person
only
and
as
a
last
resort
after
the
child
is
born
the
next
and
last
important
thing
is
the
coming
away
of
the
placenta
or
afterbirth
this
often
occurs
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
or
a
half
hour
or
may
be
longer
delayed
in
the
meantime
the
mother
should
be
warmly
covered
and
any
drink
given
her
should
not
be
either
extremely
hot
or
extremely
cold
the
afterbirth
should
be
kept
in
a
vessel
prepared
for
it
until
the
doctor
has
inspected
it
so
that
he
may
know
whether
all
the
parts
have
come
away
or
not
if
any
part
remains
it
might
cause
serious
trouble
these
things
successfully
accomplished
the
bathing
of
the
child
and
care
of
the
mother
are
next
in
order
how
soon
these
should
be
undertaken
would
have
to
be
determined
by
conditions
with
the
mother
a
period
of
rest
is
sometimes
very
desirable
when
bathing
her
body
or
changing
her
bed
the
greatest
care
should
be
exercised
to
protect
her
from
the
danger
of
contracting
cold
during
these
hours
her
physical
nature
undergoes
a
great
revolution
and
exposure
at
this
time
might
entail
permanent
results
of
a
serious
character
fevers
bealed
breasts
the
aches
pains
and
perils
which
so
often
accompany
and
follow
confinement
are
almost
wholly
due
to
lack
of
proper
care
at
this
period
if
the
young
husband
is
intelligent
and
desires
the
comfort
and
of
his
wife
he
will
see
that
for
a
sufficient
period
she
is
protected
against
callers
and
even
the
visits
of
friends
she
is
weak
and
needs
absolute
rest
she
needs
at
least
several
days
or
more
before
she
should
be
visited
if
callers
are
allowed
in
her
room
they
are
liable
to
remain
too
long
if
you
lack
the
nerve
to
decline
callers
the
privilege
they
may
expect
then
ask
your
physician
to
order
that
no
one
see
her
at
present
the
comfort
safety
and
of
the
wife
renders
the
selection
of
a
good
nurse
a
matter
of
as
great
importance
as
the
choice
of
a
good
physician
in
this
matter
the
doctor
is
oftentimes
the
best
counselor
he
is
constantly
coming
in
contact
with
those
who
are
in
charge
where
he
is
in
attendance
and
his
suggestions
ought
to
be
most
valuable
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
she
should
be
a
woman
of
pure
blood
and
for
this
a
good
moral
character
is
the
best
guarantee
it
is
not
wise
to
suppose
that
since
she
is
to
remain
but
for
a
few
weeks
the
question
of
character
is
of
no
moment
for
without
any
outward
evidences
to
arouse
suspicion
she
might
bring
with
her
and
by
kissing
and
in
other
ways
communicate
to
the
child
the
results
of
venereal
and
other
diseases
which
might
entail
from
this
unsuspected
source
consequences
from
which
years
could
not
bring
subsequent
relief
medical
authorities
assert
that
at
least
six
weeks
are
required
after
childbirth
before
the
womb
assumes
its
natural
size
and
position
an
eminent
physician
writing
in
the
new
york
says
i
have
watched
this
very
carefully
in
a
number
of
women
and
have
seen
in
the
perfectly
clean
womb
of
a
mother
involution
delayed
as
late
as
the
third
month
it
is
perfectly
safe
to
say
that
parents
will
make
no
mistake
by
observing
the
requirement
of
the
levitical
teaching
upon
this
subject
after
confinement
or
miscarriage
marital
relations
should
be
wholly
omitted
for
a
period
upon
this
point
the
sanitary
regulations
of
the
mosaic
economy
were
very
explicit
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
leviticus
instruction
is
given
that
after
the
birth
of
a
male
child
at
least
forty
days
should
elapse
and
after
the
birth
of
a
female
or
maid
child
at
least
eighty
days
should
be
permitted
to
elapse
just
why
there
should
be
this
difference
in
time
six
weeks
after
the
birth
of
a
male
child
and
three
months
after
the
birth
of
a
female
child
seems
not
to
be
clearly
understood
either
by
theologians
or
medical
authorities
when
we
know
that
this
is
intended
and
enjoined
we
can
rest
assured
that
there
are
good
and
sufficient
reasons
whether
they
be
physical
social
sanitary
or
political
no
thoughtful
or
considerate
husband
would
desire
to
impose
upon
his
wife
such
exactions
as
would
result
in
her
certain
discomfort
and
possibly
in
such
permanent
physical
injuries
as
are
quite
sure
to
follow
one
of
the
medical
journals
recently
contained
an
incident
narrated
by
a
physician
who
had
attended
a
woman
in
five
different
confinements
in
each
instance
the
physician
noticed
that
about
the
seventh
or
eighth
day
the
temperature
of
the
patient
indicated
some
unusual
physical
disturbance
or
irregularity
in
the
last
confinement
when
the
physician
called
to
mind
similar
conditions
during
previous
periods
of
convalescence
he
decided
to
discover
the
cause
and
by
questioning
the
patient
very
critically
learned
that
the
guilty
husband
was
the
occasion
of
his
wife
trouble
while
such
occurrences
are
shameful
in
the
highest
degree
yet
it
is
possible
that
such
gross
conduct
is
the
occasion
of
many
relapses
upon
the
part
of
convalescing
mothers
and
to
this
it
is
probable
that
many
deaths
may
easily
be
attributable
that
some
husbands
are
brutal
in
this
respect
we
need
but
simply
to
name
that
an
eminent
physician
of
philadelphia
has
stated
that
a
legal
friend
had
told
him
that
he
had
procured
a
divorce
within
two
years
from
her
marriage
for
a
wife
whose
charges
of
cruelty
were
sustained
by
the
evidence
that
three
days
after
her
confinement
her
husband
had
driven
the
nurse
out
of
his
wife
room
in
order
that
he
might
make
this
cruel
exaction
of
her
after
the
little
stranger
is
safely
landed
bathed
dressed
and
has
had
a
sufficient
period
of
rest
the
matter
of
nourishment
is
likely
to
come
up
for
consideration
the
food
which
nature
has
provided
is
best
suited
to
the
physical
requirements
of
the
child
and
is
found
in
the
breasts
the
earliest
secretions
of
her
breast
constitute
what
is
called
colostrum
and
is
purgative
in
character
designed
to
cleanse
the
child
bowels
of
the
meconium
or
substance
with
which
they
are
filled
previous
to
birth
other
food
should
never
be
substituted
until
failure
has
resulted
in
an
honest
serious
effort
to
conform
to
nature
purpose
if
for
any
reason
the
child
can
not
obtain
the
nourishment
which
should
be
provided
by
the
mother
it
needs
very
little
food
until
the
third
day
if
the
serious
results
attendant
upon
artificial
food
and
the
provision
of
were
fully
understood
the
terrible
consequences
which
come
to
both
the
children
and
their
parents
as
the
result
of
such
courses
would
be
studiously
avoided
the
desire
to
escape
the
nursing
and
care
of
children
so
as
early
to
return
to
the
rounds
of
social
duties
and
marital
excesses
is
a
great
mistake
the
of
the
mother
as
well
as
of
the
child
is
dependent
upon
the
fulfillment
of
the
natural
obligations
which
are
inseparable
from
the
relation
of
motherhood
in
large
cities
there
are
women
who
lead
dissolute
lives
put
away
their
own
children
and
then
rent
themselves
out
as
when
interviewed
they
tell
plausible
stories
and
ingratiate
themselves
sometimes
into
good
families
to
render
the
double
service
of
nurse
and
artificial
mother
many
of
these
women
are
not
only
devoid
of
moral
character
but
bring
to
the
child
the
degenerating
influences
which
are
inseparable
from
the
vice
and
impurity
which
is
a
part
of
their
own
being
not
infrequently
these
women
bring
with
them
the
of
gonorrhea
and
syphilis
and
the
innocent
child
which
is
entitled
to
the
nourishment
from
the
body
of
its
own
mother
is
subjected
by
unthinking
parents
to
the
necessity
of
feeding
at
fountains
which
flow
with
corruption
disease
and
death
it
is
on
this
very
account
that
the
children
of
the
middle
and
even
lower
classes
are
generally
stronger
physically
intellectually
and
morally
than
the
children
of
those
whose
wealth
and
inclination
incline
them
to
dissipation
and
excess
to
late
hours
and
rich
food
and
who
from
simple
preference
subject
their
children
to
artificial
food
or
to
the
dangers
and
diseases
which
are
so
often
brought
into
the
home
by
a
and
vicious
fatherhood
no
less
than
motherhood
has
its
duties
and
its
pleasures
it
is
not
only
the
father
duty
but
it
ought
also
to
be
his
pleasure
to
look
after
his
own
children
some
husbands
speak
of
the
baby
as
though
it
belonged
wholly
to
the
wife
and
not
to
them
the
thought
of
caring
for
or
tending
the
child
seems
to
be
as
foreign
to
their
minds
as
though
it
were
a
child
adopted
by
their
wives
from
a
foundling
asylum
it
is
not
only
the
privilege
but
the
honor
of
the
father
to
be
found
enjoying
the
pleasure
and
satisfaction
of
holding
and
caring
for
his
children
at
proper
times
and
intervals
of
leisure
one
of
the
prettiest
pictures
of
home
life
is
a
painting
in
one
of
the
galleries
of
europe
of
the
king
of
belgium
upon
his
hands
and
knees
upon
the
floor
of
the
nursery
playing
horse
with
his
own
royal
children
some
men
seem
to
act
as
though
it
were
a
disgrace
for
them
to
carry
their
own
children
through
the
streets
or
push
the
baby
carriage
when
accompanied
by
their
own
wives
every
person
has
seen
some
strong
stalwart
father
with
weak
character
walking
by
the
side
of
a
delicate
nervous
wife
who
is
weak
and
faint
because
of
the
burden
of
carrying
a
child
which
belongs
as
much
to
the
father
as
to
the
mother
before
they
were
married
this
same
man
would
not
allow
the
delicate
darling
by
his
side
to
carry
her
parasol
but
now
that
they
are
married
she
is
permitted
to
carry
a
child
that
weighs
ten
or
twenty
pounds
or
even
more
for
great
distances
because
of
the
false
pride
of
her
unthoughtful
husband
we
once
knew
a
pastor
of
a
prominent
city
church
who
lived
adjacent
to
a
small
park
where
he
was
accustomed
at
times
to
sit
in
the
shade
and
read
after
a
baby
came
into
their
home
being
a
sensible
man
he
found
pleasure
in
giving
some
time
and
attention
to
his
child
used
sometimes
to
wheel
it
through
the
park
in
a
baby
carriage
or
have
the
carriage
stand
near
him
while
he
sat
and
read
his
home
was
not
without
a
sufficient
number
of
helpers
and
one
of
his
parishioners
ventured
one
day
to
suggest
that
it
was
not
becoming
to
take
the
baby
with
him
when
he
went
into
the
park
to
read
but
the
sensible
father
resented
not
only
the
insult
which
was
offered
to
him
personally
but
to
universal
fatherhood
by
replying
that
it
was
his
baby
and
he
would
do
with
it
as
he
pleased
the
presence
of
a
baby
is
a
blessing
in
any
home
it
is
a
blessing
to
the
father
as
well
as
to
the
mother
some
men
are
not
good
fathers
the
same
as
some
women
are
not
the
best
of
mothers
but
any
thoughtful
husband
will
concede
the
fact
that
a
proper
apprehension
of
the
relation
which
he
sustains
to
the
baby
that
is
born
in
his
home
calls
for
a
recognition
of
the
privileges
and
obligations
of
a
father
to
himself
to
his
child
and
to
his
wife
as
well
what
his
home
is
what
his
children
are
to
become
will
depend
as
much
and
possibly
more
upon
what
he
is
and
does
than
upon
the
little
woman
whose
time
talent
and
strength
are
already
taxed
to
their
utmost
by
the
various
and
constant
demands
which
she
must
hourly
meet
part
iii
concerning
his
children
chapter
xvii
heredity
we
now
come
in
the
third
and
last
part
of
this
book
to
write
of
what
a
young
husband
ought
to
know
with
regard
to
his
children
if
his
children
are
to
be
greatly
benefited
by
the
wisdom
of
the
father
he
should
be
in
possession
of
the
knowledge
imparted
in
the
following
chapters
many
years
before
he
is
in
possession
of
the
children
after
they
have
received
their
inheritance
from
the
parents
their
bodies
have
been
molded
and
fashioned
and
bent
and
direction
already
given
to
their
character
it
is
then
too
late
to
put
such
knowledge
into
practical
use
much
of
what
might
be
said
in
the
closing
chapters
of
this
book
has
already
found
expression
in
the
pages
preceding
the
doctrine
of
transmission
and
inheritance
pervades
not
only
this
entire
book
but
also
the
two
which
precede
it
in
the
series
while
it
is
true
that
too
much
importance
can
not
be
placed
upon
the
subject
of
heredity
the
inheritance
which
we
receive
not
only
from
our
parents
and
grandparents
but
even
from
our
and
while
it
is
true
that
all
that
can
be
acquired
in
character
and
culture
both
intellectual
and
physical
is
transmitted
from
the
parents
to
their
children
yet
possibly
that
which
is
by
far
the
largest
factor
in
determining
the
physical
intellectual
social
and
moral
endowment
of
the
child
are
found
in
the
influences
which
mold
and
fashion
the
child
during
the
months
which
lie
between
the
period
of
conception
and
the
time
of
birth
the
potent
influences
of
these
different
periods
stand
related
to
each
other
somewhat
like
what
may
be
seen
in
the
studio
of
an
artist
who
molds
and
fashions
in
clay
the
models
which
are
afterward
to
be
actualized
in
brass
or
bronze
while
the
success
of
the
work
might
be
said
to
be
greatly
dependent
upon
the
character
quality
and
condition
of
the
clay
brought
to
hand
for
this
service
and
while
no
perfect
result
could
be
secured
with
indifferent
material
yet
it
is
easy
to
see
how
with
the
very
best
material
at
hand
an
indifferent
artist
or
a
good
artist
when
in
indifferent
mood
would
produce
a
very
inferior
model
if
with
the
thought
of
modifying
the
bronze
figure
after
it
has
been
cast
the
artist
is
indifferent
to
the
merits
of
the
model
which
he
is
making
the
final
result
can
only
prove
a
failure
no
step
in
the
work
is
unimportant
but
the
most
important
of
all
is
the
perfection
of
the
model
in
his
hands
the
clay
readily
yields
itself
to
his
thought
and
impression
constant
momentary
care
will
prevent
defects
and
deformities
which
could
not
be
wholly
remedied
or
refashioned
even
by
months
and
years
of
subsequent
toil
a
wise
man
when
asked
at
what
period
a
child
education
should
begin
replied
twenty
years
before
it
is
born
this
is
not
an
extreme
statement
and
if
it
errs
in
anything
it
errs
in
making
the
period
too
short
rather
than
too
long
henry
ward
beecher
once
said
that
since
so
much
depends
upon
one
ancestors
a
man
ought
to
be
very
careful
in
choosing
his
grandparents
and
there
is
a
vast
deal
of
truth
suggested
by
this
statement
a
young
woman
can
not
be
too
careful
in
choosing
the
man
who
is
to
become
the
father
of
her
children
and
a
young
man
can
not
exercise
too
much
care
in
selecting
the
woman
who
is
to
become
the
mother
of
his
children
in
writing
of
heredity
and
prenatal
influences
the
subject
divides
itself
naturally
into
the
three
periods
which
we
have
previously
suggested
the
preparation
which
precedes
conception
the
mental
and
physical
condition
at
the
time
of
conjunction
the
environment
and
the
mental
and
physical
states
of
the
mother
during
the
period
of
gestation
so
much
depends
upon
heredity
that
men
who
are
interested
in
the
breeding
of
horses
for
the
recognize
the
fact
that
unless
a
horse
comes
of
racing
stock
he
can
not
be
possessed
of
these
essential
qualities
without
which
he
can
not
possibly
win
it
is
said
by
those
who
have
made
a
study
of
it
that
in
england
no
horse
has
been
known
to
win
in
any
considerable
race
that
was
not
bred
of
racing
stock
occasionally
a
horse
with
an
ordinary
pedigree
may
exhibit
wonderful
speed
for
a
distance
but
none
possesses
the
wind
and
endurance
necessary
for
a
long
race
with
animals
of
a
pure
blood
and
a
good
pedigree
to
this
good
inheritance
the
horseman
adds
constant
training
and
the
best
of
care
if
these
are
at
any
time
neglected
the
horse
begins
to
degenerate
and
reverts
to
the
level
of
the
ordinary
animal
it
is
generally
agreed
by
physicians
and
those
who
have
devoted
time
to
the
study
of
this
subject
that
the
mind
and
temper
of
the
parents
at
the
moment
of
conjunction
have
a
great
influence
upon
the
temper
and
disposition
of
the
child
children
should
never
be
begotten
except
at
those
times
when
the
husband
and
the
wife
can
both
bring
their
contribution
of
good
health
affection
and
mental
composure
something
of
the
effects
produced
by
the
mental
states
will
appear
by
what
we
have
to
say
in
subsequent
paragraphs
in
most
instances
it
is
perhaps
true
as
we
have
already
suggested
that
the
greatest
influences
exerted
upon
the
health
disposition
and
character
are
those
which
are
effected
by
the
physical
and
mental
condition
of
the
mother
and
the
character
of
her
environment
during
the
period
of
gestation
while
much
of
what
we
would
like
to
know
concerning
prenatal
influences
is
shrouded
in
mystery
behind
a
veil
that
shuts
us
out
from
this
holy
of
holies
in
which
god
dwells
in
mysterious
creative
power
yet
we
do
know
that
peace
of
mind
equanimity
of
temper
purity
of
life
loving
affections
and
exalted
aspirations
beget
influences
which
are
favorable
to
the
production
of
the
best
physical
intellectual
and
moral
endowments
if
strong
mental
excitement
anger
emotion
or
fatigue
affect
injuriously
the
milk
of
the
mother
so
that
the
nursing
child
at
once
feels
disturbed
and
injured
then
we
can
reasonably
understand
how
the
child
during
the
months
prior
to
its
birth
while
it
is
even
more
dependent
and
far
more
intimately
connected
with
the
of
the
mother
body
and
under
the
impress
of
her
mental
state
must
be
affected
in
a
manner
correspondingly
greater
while
scientists
at
the
present
stage
of
inquiry
and
investigation
have
not
been
able
to
weigh
and
measure
the
force
and
effect
of
these
influences
yet
some
results
have
been
secured
which
help
us
to
understand
the
existence
of
powers
which
were
previously
too
subtle
to
be
brought
into
the
realm
of
human
knowledge
something
of
the
manner
in
which
the
mental
condition
of
the
mother
may
affect
the
child
is
suggested
by
the
interesting
experiments
conducted
by
elmer
gates
in
his
laboratory
at
chevy
chase
washington
gates
has
demonstrated
the
fact
that
even
the
breath
is
so
affected
by
the
mental
state
that
by
analyzing
the
residuum
which
remains
upon
a
which
has
been
breathed
upon
he
is
able
to
determine
the
character
of
the
mental
condition
of
the
individual
at
the
time
the
breath
was
exhaled
upon
the
glass
anger
revenge
jealousy
joy
pain
pleasure
and
possibly
all
the
emotions
stamp
their
distinctive
messages
upon
the
breath
with
as
much
accuracy
as
the
little
machine
in
the
telegraph
office
registers
its
message
in
characters
which
we
need
only
to
know
in
order
to
be
read
what
some
of
these
many
characters
are
gates
has
been
able
to
decipher
and
his
investigations
and
discoveries
establish
the
fact
that
the
mentality
of
the
individual
is
stamped
upon
the
breath
the
mind
not
only
affects
the
breath
but
it
affects
the
entire
individual
and
this
statement
is
proven
by
the
fact
that
the
character
of
the
exhalations
of
the
body
are
affected
by
the
mentality
of
the
individual
it
is
a
fact
that
not
only
does
each
different
disease
produce
its
own
peculiar
bodily
odor
but
mental
states
produce
similar
effects
it
is
affirmed
that
the
odor
in
an
insane
asylum
differs
from
the
odor
in
all
other
institutions
it
is
stated
that
no
amount
of
care
and
cleanliness
or
even
fumigation
can
rid
the
wards
and
rooms
of
this
subtle
and
distinctive
odor
peculiar
to
the
bodily
exhalations
of
those
who
are
affected
with
mental
infirmities
insane
asylums
do
not
afford
the
only
illustration
institutions
in
which
convicts
are
confined
also
have
an
odor
which
is
distinctive
it
differs
from
that
of
any
other
institution
and
from
the
day
that
the
buildings
are
completed
and
the
convicts
enter
the
penitentiary
odor
is
present
because
inseparable
from
those
who
inhabit
its
wards
what
is
true
of
insane
asylums
and
penitentiaries
is
doubtless
true
in
a
less
pronounced
manner
of
all
institutions
where
persons
are
classified
according
to
mental
differences
if
the
mental
states
of
the
mother
affect
her
own
bodily
health
and
if
each
of
the
diseases
of
the
body
and
of
the
mind
begets
exhalations
with
distinguishing
characteristics
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
subtle
effects
of
different
mental
states
pervade
the
entire
body
if
these
influences
effect
results
beyond
and
without
our
own
bodies
much
more
may
they
be
expected
to
influence
the
unfolding
mind
and
the
developing
body
which
are
forming
within
the
maternal
body
and
whose
intimate
dependence
upon
her
seems
to
make
them
a
part
of
her
own
person
and
individuality
something
of
these
subtle
laws
of
heredity
was
known
even
to
the
ancients
but
the
greatest
acquisitions
of
knowledge
along
these
lines
have
come
to
mankind
during
the
past
two
centuries
thomas
andrew
knight
who
was
born
at
wormley
grange
england
in
and
died
in
accomplished
such
large
results
with
vegetables
fruits
and
domestic
animals
that
he
has
quite
properly
been
considered
the
founder
of
the
science
of
horticulture
it
was
he
who
put
into
practice
the
principles
which
have
resulted
in
giving
us
the
improved
apples
pears
and
many
other
fruits
which
have
been
developed
from
the
unpalatable
wild
varieties
the
effects
later
accomplished
by
bakewell
in
the
marvelous
improvements
in
the
new
leicester
sheep
afford
one
of
many
striking
illustrations
it
is
said
that
in
the
results
effected
by
scientific
breeders
it
would
seem
as
if
they
had
at
first
drawn
a
perfect
form
and
then
given
it
life
having
first
determined
what
form
of
sheep
they
preferred
they
continued
to
select
from
the
flocks
those
which
most
nearly
approached
the
model
until
they
attained
results
which
in
their
standard
of
perfection
were
greatly
removed
from
the
original
type
if
you
compare
the
wild
boar
of
the
forests
with
the
improved
breeds
of
swine
the
results
which
have
been
secured
become
very
manifest
an
excellent
judge
of
pigs
says
pigs
legs
should
be
no
longer
than
just
to
prevent
the
animal
belly
from
trailing
on
the
ground
the
leg
is
the
least
profitable
portion
of
the
hog
and
we
therefore
require
no
more
of
it
than
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
rest
let
any
one
compare
the
wild
boar
with
any
improved
breed
and
he
will
see
how
effectually
the
legs
have
been
shortened
breeders
of
birds
and
pigeons
and
poultry
have
accomplished
in
their
departments
similar
results
it
is
to
the
results
of
such
study
and
development
that
we
owe
the
many
varieties
of
poultry
pigeons
and
birds
the
poultry
raiser
may
now
determine
whether
he
desires
birds
with
large
bodies
for
the
table
or
the
smaller
or
whether
he
prefers
other
qualities
and
he
may
select
from
the
different
varieties
such
as
are
possessed
of
the
desired
requisites
when
we
remember
what
has
been
accomplished
by
those
who
have
taken
the
wild
rose
and
produced
the
many
elaborate
and
beautiful
varieties
of
roses
which
are
now
cultivated
in
and
when
we
see
what
has
been
accomplished
by
taking
the
many
wild
flowers
of
the
field
and
developing
them
into
the
beauty
and
splendor
of
what
is
to
be
found
in
the
botanical
gardens
one
gets
a
very
fair
idea
of
what
has
really
been
accomplished
in
these
directions
in
writing
of
this
subject
holbrook
says
if
there
was
no
law
of
heredity
if
animals
and
plants
did
not
transmit
their
characters
to
their
offspring
then
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
to
try
to
improve
either
but
the
horticulturists
take
advantage
of
these
known
laws
for
the
improvement
of
the
original
plant
and
it
is
to
the
application
of
these
same
principles
that
we
owe
the
changes
which
have
transformed
the
size
and
flavor
of
the
wild
cherry
and
the
wild
grape
into
our
present
luscious
specimens
of
cultivated
fruit
in
the
raising
mating
and
development
of
birds
sheep
and
cattle
wonderful
results
may
be
secured
when
the
various
steps
are
guarded
and
directed
by
intelligence
while
it
is
true
that
in
the
mating
of
human
beings
all
is
largely
left
to
sentiment
chance
and
blind
blundering
and
while
wonderful
results
could
be
attained
could
intelligence
and
forethought
give
direction
in
human
love
affairs
yet
with
human
beings
who
intelligently
set
themselves
to
correct
mistakes
and
to
develop
talents
to
supply
deficiencies
and
prepare
to
transmit
the
very
best
results
that
are
possible
to
them
the
effort
is
approved
by
results
in
the
offspring
which
are
most
gratifying
and
satisfactory
no
one
can
doubt
the
law
of
hereditary
transmission
our
inherited
and
acquired
characteristics
are
sure
to
be
transmitted
to
our
descendants
indeed
so
thoroughly
does
character
permeate
one
entire
being
that
it
might
be
said
of
each
drop
of
blood
that
in
its
characteristics
it
is
a
miniature
of
the
person
in
whose
body
it
was
secreted
eminent
characters
do
not
emanate
from
degenerate
parents
and
neither
is
the
reverse
true
except
as
the
result
of
adequate
reversionary
influences
it
is
possible
for
almost
any
stock
to
revert
to
its
original
type
but
even
such
results
are
not
produced
without
adequate
causes
true
we
have
the
sentence
degenerate
sons
of
noble
sires
but
when
one
does
see
such
a
result
he
may
often
find
adequate
causes
eminent
men
often
have
their
powers
overtaxed
by
excessive
demands
great
lawyers
physicians
preachers
and
statesmen
often
have
such
incessant
demands
upon
their
time
and
energy
that
although
some
are
possessed
of
great
powers
of
endurance
yet
many
of
them
are
almost
always
in
a
state
of
physical
and
mental
depletion
personally
they
have
wrought
into
their
daily
effort
all
that
they
have
to
transmit
and
their
children
receive
only
the
remnants
and
dregs
of
greatness
a
depleted
body
and
a
depleted
mind
sometimes
the
degeneracy
to
the
lower
type
is
due
to
indulgence
in
social
or
other
vices
if
the
father
is
guilty
of
sexual
excesses
given
to
the
liberal
use
of
tobacco
or
uses
intoxicating
liquors
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
look
further
for
the
causes
sometimes
the
child
has
had
a
great
father
but
a
very
ordinary
mother
or
both
parents
may
have
been
great
while
the
mother
may
have
been
placed
under
the
most
disadvantageous
surroundings
and
subjected
to
the
most
unfavorable
conditions
during
the
period
of
gestation
or
after
the
birth
of
the
child
it
may
have
been
turned
over
to
the
degenerating
influences
of
diseased
and
corrupting
servants
or
it
might
be
that
the
child
had
inherited
the
real
character
of
a
father
whose
reputation
was
great
but
whose
character
was
ordinary
the
farmer
who
would
raise
a
good
crop
finds
three
things
essential
the
first
is
good
seed
the
second
is
good
soil
and
the
third
is
good
care
chapter

prenatal
influences
space
does
not
permit
us
to
go
into
a
full
discussion
of
the
theories
and
of
the
principles
which
lie
at
the
basis
of
prenatal
influences
a
few
illustrations
however
will
be
suggestive
induce
thoughtful
consideration
and
possibly
lead
many
to
a
fuller
investigation
of
the
subject
it
is
said
that
the
mother
of
robert
burns
the
scottish
poet
was
of
a
very
happy
disposition
and
evinced
a
remarkable
memory
for
old
songs
and
ballads
and
these
she
would
sing
as
she
went
about
her
daily
household
duties
another
instance
often
named
is
that
of
napoleon
bonaparte
during
the
months
preceding
his
birth
his
mother
is
said
to
have
accompanied
her
husband
on
horseback
upon
one
of
his
military
campaigns
for
several
months
she
lived
in
the
midst
of
military
surroundings
and
became
personally
interested
in
the
arts
of
war
these
influences
stamped
their
impress
upon
her
unborn
child
whose
earliest
manifestation
of
childish
interest
after
his
birth
was
an
exhibition
of
the
warlike
spirit
his
thoughts
and
boyhood
conversation
were
of
war
and
conquest
bayer
in
his
interesting
and
suggestive
book
entitled
maternal
impressions
tells
of
a
woman
who
during
the
period
of
gestation
was
stinted
in
her
allowance
of
money
and
stole
from
the
in
her
husband
store
the
son
that
was
born
to
them
was
a
kleptomaniac
whose
stealing
was
limited
to
those
of
his
own
family
and
relatives
he
stole
his
sister
watch
his
mother
gold
chain
a
new
suit
and
a
diamond
pin
from
his
father
but
he
was
never
known
to
take
anything
from
any
one
except
his
near
relatives
if
mothers
would
have
honest
children
they
should
be
careful
to
entertain
no
dishonest
inclinations
the
result
of
an
unsuccessful
effort
to
murder
one
own
unborn
offspring
is
seen
in
guiteau
the
assassin
who
shot
president
garfield
in
his
father
was
a
man
of
some
intellectual
ability
and
integrity
of
character
the
guiteau
children
were
born
in
rapid
succession
and
because
of
lack
of
means
the
mother
who
was
in
poor
health
was
obliged
to
work
harder
than
would
have
otherwise
been
the
case
before
the
birth
of
this
child
she
resorted
to
every
means
in
her
power
by
the
use
of
drugs
to
produce
an
abortion
in
this
she
was
unsuccessful
for
several
weeks
during
the
latter
part
of
her
pregnancy
she
had
brain
fever
which
probably
also
had
the
effect
of
arresting
the
development
of
some
parts
of
the
brain
of
her
child
when
the
child
was
born
it
was
weak
and
puny
and
for
months
its
life
was
one
continual
wail
it
was
months
before
the
nervous
system
became
at
all
quiet
he
was
deficient
in
common
sense
without
and
entirely
destitute
of
every
vestige
of
remorse
or
shame
he
was
born
a
degenerate
and
a
murderer
from
the
great
mass
of
matter
which
is
available
upon
the
subject
of
prenatal
influences
napheys
tells
of
the
artist
flaxman
the
outlines
of
whose
drawings
used
to
be
regarded
as
the
most
perfect
and
graceful
in
existence
from
earliest
childhood
he
manifested
a
delight
in
drawing
his
mother
a
woman
of
refinement
and
artistic
taste
used
to
relate
that
for
months
previous
to
his
birth
she
spent
hours
daily
studying
engravings
and
fixing
in
her
memory
the
most
beautiful
productions
of
the
human
figure
as
portrayed
by
masters
she
was
convinced
that
the
genius
of
her
son
was
the
fruit
of
her
own
only
a
few
days
ago
a
young
mother
who
had
been
alone
much
of
the
time
during
the
period
of
gestation
and
who
had
found
special
delight
in
books
and
reading
called
our
attention
to
the
fact
that
her
twin
girls
now
nearly
two
years
of
age
will
accept
a
book
in
preference
to
toys
and
be
contented
by
the
hour
simply
to
hold
and
handle
a
book
bayer
tells
of
a
young
wife
at
whom
some
girl
friends
pointed
their
finger
and
referring
to
her
condition
said
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
after
they
were
gone
the
young
mother
went
to
her
room
and
cried
bitterly
over
the
remark
which
the
girls
had
made
her
child
when
seen
by
bayer
at
the
age
of
six
if
any
one
a
stranger
or
friend
pointed
a
finger
at
her
would
burst
into
a
fit
of
crying
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
cure
her
of
this
habit
he
also
tells
of
a
young
mother
who
had
an
exceptionally
bright
child
when
the
child
was
three
months
old
its
brightness
was
commented
upon
by
some
of
her
friends
and
the
mother
said
impressed
that
upon
her
did
you
come
to
do
that
she
replied
have
seen
so
many
dull
children
in
my
school
work
who
could
not
understand
what
was
told
them
that
i
wanted
my
child
to
be
quick
to
perceive
and
to
comprehend
and
so
let
my
mind
dwell
upon
it
hoping
to
get
favorable
results
i
had
been
told
that
it
could
be
done
and
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
possible
many
instances
of
horrible
are
given
in
medical
books
but
it
is
not
best
to
allow
the
mind
to
dwell
upon
these
things
we
name
but
a
couple
of
instances
to
illustrate
the
principle
napheys
tells
of
a
woman
the
wife
of
a
baker
who
during
the
early
months
of
her
pregnancy
sold
bread
over
the
counter
nearly
every
day
a
child
with
a
double
thumb
came
in
for
a
penny
roll
presenting
the
money
between
the
thumb
and
the
finger
after
the
third
month
the
mother
left
the
bakery
but
the
malformation
was
so
impressed
upon
her
mind
that
she
was
not
surprised
to
see
it
reproduced
in
her
own
infant
the
mother
in
due
time
sought
to
correct
the
deformity
by
having
the
supernumerary
thumb
removed
by
a
surgical
operation
we
recently
heard
of
a
mother
who
gave
birth
to
a
child
that
had
but
one
hand
the
other
arm
was
handless
as
if
amputated
between
the
elbow
and
wrist
the
only
way
she
could
account
for
the
deficiency
in
her
child
was
the
fact
that
her
husband
brother
who
had
had
his
hand
amputated
lived
in
the
family
during
the
earlier
months
of
her
pregnancy
while
she
received
no
special
shock
being
familiar
with
his
condition
yet
the
mental
impression
continued
through
a
considerable
period
of
the
earlier
months
had
its
disastrous
result
bayer
names
some
interesting
instances
in
support
of
his
theory
that
the
disastrous
effects
of
being
frightened
in
the
earlier
months
of
gestation
may
be
corrected
by
the
wish
of
the
mother
that
her
child
may
not
be
affected
deformed
or
marked
by
the
object
or
influences
which
have
caused
her
to
be
startled
he
says
that
if
a
mother
earnestly
desires
to
counteract
a
bad
influence
she
should
hope
and
long
that
it
may
not
do
any
harm
the
result
of
such
mental
effort
will
be
beneficial
to
the
forming
brain
that
very
longing
and
desire
upon
the
part
of
the
mother
will
have
a
corresponding
effect
upon
her
child
this
idea
is
drawn
from
and
the
phenomena
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
mother
through
her
longings
creates
the
which
is
to
control
the
desires
which
her
child
will
possess
much
might
also
be
said
upon
the
subject
of
longings
in
a
general
way
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
always
best
when
the
longing
is
a
proper
one
to
see
that
it
is
promptly
gratified
even
a
desire
for
a
particular
article
of
food
is
likely
to
produce
in
the
child
a
pronounced
desire
for
the
same
thing
it
is
well
also
for
the
mother
carefully
to
note
any
longings
which
occur
during
the
period
of
gestation
as
it
may
afford
her
an
easy
clue
to
the
cause
of
the
persistent
crying
of
her
child
after
its
birth
an
instance
may
prove
suggestive
an
israelitish
mother
before
the
birth
of
her
first
child
smelled
fried
pork
and
longed
for
a
taste
of
it
but
her
religion
forbade
when
the
child
was
born
he
positively
refused
the
breast
or
bottle
the
nurse
asked
does
this
child
want
the
mother
replied
do
not
know
of
anything
except
pork
the
father
at
once
got
a
strip
of
pork
let
the
child
suck
it
a
few
moments
after
which
he
was
ready
to
nurse
the
father
also
related
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
eating
of
pork
was
contrary
to
their
religious
teaching
yet
they
had
never
been
able
to
restrain
their
son
who
was
then
years
of
age
from
eating
it
numerous
instances
are
related
in
different
books
where
young
infants
have
moaned
and
cried
continually
and
upon
being
given
a
taste
of
that
for
which
the
mother
had
longed
prior
to
the
birth
of
the
child
the
infant
at
once
became
quiet
and
afterward
seemed
passive
and
contented
we
have
read
of
a
young
mother
who
was
a
strict
temperance
woman
but
who
had
a
longing
for
liquor
her
husband
was
also
a
temperance
man
but
they
decided
that
some
be
given
the
mother
the
same
as
any
other
medicine
under
the
circumstances
in
order
to
relieve
the
longing
and
save
the
child
after
taking
a
dose
of
liquor
the
longing
passed
away
and
the
child
was
normally
born
where
the
use
of
liquor
is
persisted
in
during
the
period
of
pregnancy
many
instances
might
be
quoted
where
all
the
children
in
the
family
died
drunkards
there
are
some
exceptional
instances
in
which
the
children
of
intemperate
fathers
never
seem
possessed
of
a
desire
to
use
beverages
it
is
possible
that
investigation
might
show
in
such
instances
that
the
mother
had
such
an
abhorrence
of
the
effects
of
intemperance
upon
her
husband
that
her
constant
longing
that
her
children
might
live
sober
upright
lives
had
resulted
in
securing
for
her
a
strictly
temperance
progeny
dio
lewis
in
his
book
entitled
chastity
when
writing
of
prenatal
influences
says
it
is
not
carrying
this
subject
too
far
to
say
that
if
any
trade
or
profession
seems
particularly
desirable
the
genius
for
success
in
that
line
may
be
given
to
the
child
by
proper
effort
before
its
birth
the
mother
whose
mind
persistently
dwells
upon
any
chosen
subject
during
this
nine
months
of
gestation
will
surely
see
in
her
offspring
the
mark
of
her
thought
beauty
of
person
strength
of
mind
sweetness
of
disposition
and
holy
aspiration
may
be
assured
to
posterity
by
parents
wise
and
loving
enough
to
fulfill
the
laws
which
lead
to
the
desired
results
napheys
in
writing
upon
the
same
subject
says
what
a
charming
idea
is
this
what
an
incentive
to
those
about
to
become
mothers
to
cultivate
refinement
high
thoughts
pure
emotion
elevated
sentiments
the
character
and
disposition
of
the
children
oftentimes
indicate
the
influences
which
surrounded
the
mother
during
the
months
prior
to
their
birth
the
is
likely
to
resemble
the
father
more
closely
than
the
children
born
later
because
the
bride
is
apt
to
have
her
thoughts
dwell
much
upon
her
young
husband
those
born
during
a
period
of
financial
prosperity
are
likely
to
be
liberal
sometimes
wasteful
and
possibly
spendthrifts
those
born
during
the
years
when
means
are
scarce
and
economy
is
necessary
are
likely
to
be
economical
and
some
even
miserly
prenatal
influences
are
both
subtle
and
potent
and
no
amount
of
wealth
or
learning
or
influence
can
secure
exemption
from
them
no
golden
lock
or
jeweled
hand
can
successfully
hold
the
door
against
the
admission
of
these
influences
medical
science
has
done
much
to
mend
defects
alleviate
suffering
patch
up
broken
constitutions
and
effect
great
improvements
but
the
greatest
remains
to
be
accomplished
by
remedying
as
far
as
possible
the
causes
of
these
great
evils
by
disseminating
intelligence
and
inspiring
parents
and
young
people
with
such
knowledge
and
purposes
as
will
prepare
the
way
for
the
raising
up
of
a
superior
generation
in
this
work
the
philanthropic
physician
occupies
the
place
of
greatest
usefulness
parents
need
to
realize
that
the
work
of
is
greater
than
the
work
of
reforming
the
philanthropist
who
labors
for
the
reformation
of
adults
does
well
those
who
give
their
energy
and
effort
to
the
education
and
proper
bringing
up
of
children
do
better
but
those
who
intelligently
devote
themselves
to
the
proper
formation
of
the
body
character
and
disposition
of
those
yet
unborn
do
best
of
all
we
are
thoroughly
orthodox
upon
the
subject
of
human
depravity
but
we
believe
that
persons
may
be
so
generated
as
to
be
the
more
easy
subjects
of
regeneration
or
they
may
be
so
conceived
and
born
in

as
manifestly
to
illustrate

declaration
of
the
psalmist
the
wicked
are
estranged
from
the
womb
they
go
astray
as
soon
as
they
are
born
before
leaving
this
subject
we
desire
to
say
a
word
which
may
be
of
comfort
to
any
parents
whose
children
may
be
born
to
them
with
some
blemish
or
deformity
god

so
equipped
the
and
the
that
they
should
love
and
care
for
those
who
are
unattractive
or
even
unsightly
we
recently
heard
of
a
mother
whose
child
was
born
with
a
harelip
and
fearing
lest
the
sight
of
the
child
might
have
a
depressing
effect
upon
the
mother
in
her
enfeebled
condition
various
excuses
were
made
to
keep
the
child
out
of
her
sight
for
a
period
of
several
days
when
evasions
would
avail
no
longer
and
the
mother
was
shown
her
child
after
a
momentary
sense
of
disappointment
she
said
well
it
is
my
child
and
i
can
love
it
just
the
same
it
is
also
an
encouragement
to
know
that
what
are
ordinarily
called
birthmarks
generally
diminish
and
oftentimes
disappear
after
a
brief
period
russegger
tells
of
a
woman
who
in
the
seventh
month
of
her
pregnancy
was
bitten
in
the
calf
of
her
leg
by
a
dog
at
the
moment
of
the
accident
she
was
somewhat
alarmed
but
neither
then
nor
afterward
had
any
fear
that
her
child
would
be
affected
by
the
occurrence
ten
weeks
later
when
her
child
was
born
there
were
marks
upon
the
calf
of
its
right
leg
resembling
the
impressions
made
by
the
dog
teeth
upon
the
leg
of
the
mother
the
impressions
of
two
of
the
teeth
disappeared
in
five
weeks
and
the
others
gradually
faded
away
similar
results
may
be
expected
in
most
instances
there
is
one
branch
of
the
prenatal
subject
which
has
reference
to
determining
the
sex
before
birth
in
which
some
persons
because
of
a
predominance
of
either
male
or
female
children
in
their
families
may
naturally
and
properly
have
special
interest
the
desire
of
some
parents
for
male
children
in
preference
to
female
children
is
both
wrong
and
unworthy
of
that
proper
christian
regard
in
which
woman
should
rightfully
be
held
in
heathen
countries
because
of
the
hardships
to
which
women
are
subjected
the
parents
are
often
sad
when
a
girl
is
born
into
the
family
but
in
christian
lands
where
the
influences
of
the
gospel
have
given
woman
her
proper
place
and
rightful
recognition
the
feeling
which
disparages
the
girl
child
or
would
lead
to
a
preference
for
male
children
to
the
exclusion
of
female
children
is
altogether
wrong
and
unworthy
of
our
christian
civilization
it
will
readily
be
seen
from
the
effect
of
prenatal
influences
that
it
would
not
be
desirable
because
of
its
effects
upon
the
formation
of
the
growing
life
within
the
mother
body
that
she
should
allow
her
mind
to
dwell
largely
upon
these
subjects
or
anxiously
desire
one
sex
in
preference
to
another
where
such
influences
are
exerted
upon
the
embryo
a
male
child
with
an
effeminate
girlish
nature
or
a
female
child
with
a
boyish
masculine
disposition
might
be
the
result
while
it
is
perfectly
proper
that
parents
should
know
what
views
are
held
by
medical
and
scientific
men
upon
these
subjects
it
is
not
best
that
the
mother
mind
should
be
influenced
by
the
consideration
of
them
during
the
period
of
gestation
the
influences
which
control
and
determine
sex
are
so
subtle
and
have
hitherto
so
thoroughly
evaded
human
investigation
and
study
that
little
or
no
reliance
can
be
placed
upon
any
of
the
theories
of
the
vast
number
of
theories
many
are
ludicrous
some
are
exact
contraries
of
others
a
few
seem
plausible
while
none
have
been
found
infallible
or
even
reliable
some
have
held
that
the
phases
of
the
moon
at
the
period
of
conception
controlled
and
determined
the
sex
of
the
offspring
others
have
held
that
the
season
of
the
year
when
the
ovum
is
produced
and
fertilized
determines
the
result
this
theory
makes
it
largely
a
question
of
temperature
and
climate
the
theory
which
has
had
many
advocates
is
one
that
contends
that
the
question
of
sex
is
largely
determined
by
the
question
of
food
prior
to
conception
and
during
the
period
of
gestation
by
persons
who
hold
this
theory
it
is
maintained
that
during
periods
of
prosperity
and
plenty
the
number
of
girl
children
preponderate
and
that
during
periods
of
adversity
and
when
food
is
less
abundant
the
majority
of
those
who
are
born
are
boys
another
theory
which
has
been
often
repeated
and
as
often
disproved
is
that
the
sex
of
the
offspring
is
determined
by
the
side
of
the
reproductive
system
engaged
in
the
production
of
the
ovum
and
of
the
sperm
that
if
the
generative
glands
upon
the
right
side
of
the
body
of
the
mother
and
of
the
father
are
engaged
a
male
child
is
the
result
but
if
the
left
sides
are
engaged
the
result
is
a
girl
this
theory
maintains
that
the
ovum
which
proceeds
from
the
right
ovary
results
in
the
formation
of
the
body
of
a
male
child
while
those
that
proceed
from
the
left
ovary
result
in
the
production
of
a
female
child
that
this
theory
is
not
reliable
has
often
been
demonstrated
in
instances
where
the
right
or
the
left
ovary
of
the
woman
has
been
removed
by
surgical
operation
and
she
has
subsequently
become
the
mother
both
of
male
and
of
female
offspring
the
same
is
true
with
regard
to
fathers
who
have
by
accident
or
disease
lost
one
of
the
testes
and
have
subsequently
become
the
fathers
of
both
boys
and
girls
another
theory
which
has
received
considerable
attention
is
that
the
ova
liberated
from
month
to
month
alternate
in
gender
that
one
month
the
ovum
is
of
that
character
which
would
result
in
the
production
of
a
male
child
and
the
succeeding
month
of
such
a
nature
as
would
result
in
the
production
of
a
female
child
some
hold
that
the
respective
ages
of
the
parents
have
something
to
do
with
determining
the
question
of
the
sex
of
their
offspring
that
where
the
father
is
older
than
the
mother
female
children
are
likely
to
predominate
some
hold
that
the
superior
vitality
of
the
father
or
of
the
mother
will
result
in
the
production
of
sex
of
their
own
kind
some
persons
who
have
given
attention
and
study
to
this
subject
teach
exactly
the
reverse
of
these
two
theories
the
theory
which
has
been
largely
accepted
by
intelligent
medical
authorities
is
that
children
conceived
in
from
two
to
six
days
after
the
cessation
of
the
menses
are
generally
girls
and
that
those
conceived
in
from
nine
to
twelve
days
after
the
cessation
of
the
menses
are
boys
or
in
other
words
that
those
begotten
in
the
earlier
period
after
the
cessation
of
the
monthly
period
of
the
mother
are
likely
to
be
girls
and
those
begotten
in
the
later
period
are
likely
to
be
boys
there
are
many
theories
some
of
which
seem
altogether
fanciful
if
not
silly
such
as
that
the
sex
of
the
child
is
determined
by
the
side
of
the
bed
upon
which
the
father
sleeps
whether
the
bed
is
situated
so
that
the
persons
lie
with
their
heads
toward
the
north
or
some
other
point
of
the
compass
knowing
the
natural
curiosity
of
not
a
few
persons
upon
such
subjects
and
the
abnormal
desire
of
some
parents
for
children
of
one
or
the
other
sex
there
are
not
a
few
impostors
who
offer
to
furnish
information
upon
these
subjects
at
a
costly
price
the
methods
proposed
are
sometimes
innocent
and
may
be
without
injury
while
in
many
other
instances
the
suggestions
are
debasing
likely
to
produce
injurious
results
and
never
reliable
while
the
desired
sex
may
be
determined
in
harmony
with
natural
laws
the
parents
may
give
all
the
credit
to
the
impostor
if
nature
has
brought
them
a
child
of
the
sex
they
have
desired
it
would
scarcely
seem
necessary
to
advise
intelligent
people
against
the
impositions
of
such
ignorant
pretenders
the
entire
subject
has
been
wrapped
in
a
mystery
hitherto
impenetrable
no
investigation
has
yet
been
able
to
secure
from
nature
her
secret
concerning
this
matter
it
is
very
possible
that
the
creator
of
mankind
has
purposely
placed
this
knowledge
beyond
human
reach
and
left
the
regulation
of
this
important
matter
wholly
to
his
own
infinite
decrees

childhood
while
it
is
possibly
true
that
the
most
potent
molding
influences
may
be
exerted
prior
to
the
birth
of
the
child
yet
where
parents
have
lacked
the
intelligence
to
avail
themselves
of
the
largest
and
best
results
in
this
respect
or
discover
defects
after
their
children
are
born
there
still
remains
an
opportunity
for
them
they
can
in
some
measure
retrieve
lost
opportunities
correct
defects
supply
deficiencies
and
even
accomplish
wonderful
results
in
the
training
and
development
of
their
children
as
the
twig
is
bent
the
tree
is
inclined
if
the
twig
is
crooked
if
taken
very
early
it
may
be
straightened
but
it
is
far
better
that
the
twig
should
be
straight
at
first
and
without
the
necessity
of
being
straightened
it
is
better
that
children
should
be
born
without
defects
rather
than
that
there
should
be
the
necessity
of
correcting
these
mistakes
but
as
a
straight
twig
may
be
bent
to
its
permanent
and
incurable
injury
so
a
child
properly
nurtured
and
may
be
injured
or
totally
ruined
mentally
morally
or
physically
by
deficient
or
defective
training
during
its
childhood
there
are
many
excellent
books
upon
the
nurture
and
training
of
children
and
young
parents
would
do
well
to
avail
themselves
of
the
advantages
and
excellent
suggestions
afforded
by
such
publications
there
are
also
many
excellent
periodicals
for
young
parents
such
as
the
new
crusade
trained
motherhood
the
mothers
journal
and
others
which
are
very
valuable
and
almost
indispensable
from
such
books
and
periodicals
young
parents
can
obtain
the
best
of
suggestions
with
regard
to
the
early
care
proper
nurture
and
careful
training
of
their
little
ones
we
can
not
now
dwell
upon
any
of
the
many
important
phases
of
space
only
affords
opportunity
to
emphasize
some
things
which
seem
to
us
of
special
importance
and
likely
to
be
overlooked
many
young
parents
think
that
the
training
of
their
children
will
be
a
matter
for
consideration
when
they
are
three
or
four
years
old
no
more
serious
mistake
can
possibly
be
made
the
first
three
months
will
determine
the
babyhood
and
the
first
two
years
the
childhood
and
the
childhood
will
determine
the
manhood
or
womanhood
the
first
two
years
may
almost
be
said
to
determine
both
the
character
and
the
destiny
of
the
child
for
all
time
to
come
the
child
that
is
not
properly
taught
during
the
first
two
years
is
likely
to
remain
untaught
undisciplined
uncontrolled
and
oftentimes
uncontrollable
for
the
remainder
of
its
childhood
and
throughout
its
entire
life
the
questions
of
the
hours
of
feeding
the
hours
for
sleep
whether
the
child
is
to
be
rocked
or
carried
when
it
whimpers
all
these
are
questions
of
the
utmost
importance
from
the
very
beginning
many
a
mother
has
been
enslaved
for
life
because
of
the
mistakes
which
she
made
during
the
first
few
weeks
after
her
child
was
born
parents
should
protect
their
children
against
the
silly
and
dangerous
habit
of
being
promiscuously
kissed
the
prevalent
custom
of
kissing
babies
and
children
is
not
only
silly
upon
the
part
of
those
who
do
it
but
a
nuisance
to
the
child
and
in
many
instances
detrimental
to
the
health
of
the
child
where
promiscuous
kissing
is
allowed
persons
with
offensive
breath
consumptive
tendencies
contagious
and
even
loathsome
diseases
may
unintentionally
inflict
irreparable
wrong
upon
both
the
child
and
its
parents
only
the
other
day
we
read
in
a
medical
journal
where
a
young
child
of
poor
parents
who
kept
a
was
kissed
by
one
of
the
boarders
who
communicated
to
the
child
one
of
the
most
loathsome
of
diseases
such
dangers
exist
not
only
among
the
poor
but
are
perhaps
even
more
prevalent
among
the
affluent
in
the
circle
of
whose
acquaintances
there
is
likely
to
be
some
but
vicious
and
corrupt
individual
let
no
care
or
proper
expense
be
spared
in
making
the
influences
which
are
exerted
in
the
nursery
both
attractive
and
potent
young
parents
should
be
their
children
best
playfellows
there
should
be
a
proper
amount
of
games
amusements
books
papers
pictures
chosen
with
scrupulous
care
and

and
mother
influence
in
the
midst
of
them
all
what
the
child
needs
above
playthings
books
clothes
and
every
other
earthly
thing
is
presence
and
influence
of
no
other
woman
in
the
world
can
take
her
place
many
mothers
farm
their
children
out
to
nurses
and
then
give
themselves
to
household
duties
social
pleasures
or
possibly
to
duties
which
may
be
important
in
themselves
but
which
after
all
can
only
be
secondary
to
the
discharge
of
the
duties
of
motherhood
many
otherwise
excellent
women
find
the
nursery
a
prison
and
the
care
of
their
own
children
irksome
simply
because
they
have
a
perverted
the
mother
should
have
proper
relief
from
the
care
of
her
children
but
if
she
has
the
true
the
companionship
of
her
children
will
be
the
society
which
she
will
prefer
above
that
of
all
others
where
servants
are
necessary
and
such
cases
do
exist
parents
should
exercise
the
utmost
caution
in
guarding
the
purity
of
their
children
hundreds
and
we
can
properly
say
thousands
of
children
are
annually
wronged
and
ruined
by
the
vices
practiced
upon
them
by
servants
this
is
an
especial
danger
where
nurses
and
servants
are
permitted
to
undress
the
child
and
put
it
to
bed
at
night
many
a
nurse
who
is
anxious
to
quiet
her
little
charge
that
it
may
fall
asleep
promptly
is
guilty
of
exciting
sensations
which
quiet
the
child
and
prevent
its
crying
but
which
inflict
upon
the
nervous
system
of
an
infant
results
of
the
most
character
mothers
are
very
apt
to
be
unsuspecting
in
these
matters
and
therefore
it
is
highly
important
that
the
attention
of
fathers
should
be
called
to
this
grave
danger
the
child
should
also
be
protected
against
being
frightened
being
made
afraid
in
the
dark
told
of
spooks
bugaboos
the
old
and
the
police
coming
for
them
remember
also
that
in
this
most
impressible
period
of
servants
and
others
can
do
the
child
great
injury
by
teaching
it
to
be
deceitful
and
untruthful
it
is
at
this
age
also
that
they
learn
incorrect
and
ungrammatical
forms
of
expression
and
if
the
is
ignorant
and
silly
and
is
permitted
to
assemble
upon
the
streets
or
in
the
park
with
others
of
her
age
while
tending
the
child
a
bright
child
of
two
or
three
years
will
pick
up
more
coarseness
and
more
undesirable
information
concerning
human
depravity
than
can
be
expunged
from
its
mind
by
subsequent
months
and
years
of
careful
training
it
is
important
to
enjoin
upon
parents
the
duty
of
guarding
their
children
against
secret
vice
parents
are
very
apt
to
think
that
while
other
children
might
be
guilty
of
such
sins
their
own
children
are
too
innocent
and
too
pure
to
fall
into
such
vices
we
have
known
mothers
to
hold
up
their
hands
in
holy
horror
at
such
a
suggestion
but
when
the
more
cautious
fathers
have
watched
their
children
they
have
discovered
that
even
at
the
age
of
five
and
six
their
little
boys
have
learned
from
older
playmates
impure
companions
degraded
servants
or
by
sliding
down
the
balustrade
or
in
some
other
incidental
way
the
terrible
habit
of
young
children
can
not
be
too
carefully
guarded
in
this
important
matter
where
infants
exhibit
a
tendency
to
handle
their
private
parts
great
care
should
be
given
to
the
cleanliness
of
those
parts
and
if
continued
the
family
physician
should
be
consulted
to
see
whether
circumcision
is
not
necessary
to
remove
local
irritation
and
inflammation
this
is
found
to
be
necessary
in
many
instances
circumcision
was
an
important
sanitary
regulation
among
the
israelites
is
a
simple
surgical
operation
which
is
most
beneficial
in
its
results
and
very
important
in
many
instances
when
your
children
are
old
enough
to
ask
honest
questions
see
that
in
reply
they
receive
an
honest
answer
if
a
child
is
intelligent
and
thoughtful
one
of
the
earliest
inquiries
will
be
concerning
the
origin
of
life
when
a
little
one
is
born
into
your
own
or
another
household
it
is
only
natural
and
proper
that
intelligent
children
should
inquire
where
it
came
from
there
should
be
no
fables
about
babies
being
brought
by
doctors
or
being
found
under
or
taken
from
hollow
stumps
in
the
woods
for
an
intelligent
and
altogether
satisfactory
answer
can
be
given
to
an
intelligent
child
of
six
or
seven
years
and
even
younger
another
has
aptly
and
truthfully
said
ignorance
is
a
deadly
sin
the
truth
properly
told
has
never
yet
harmed
a
child
silence
false
modesty
and
mystery
have
corrupted
the
souls
and
bodies
of
untold
millions
where
parents
are
intelligent
upon
this
subject
and
know
how
to
present
these
matters
properly
to
the
thought
of
their
children
we
have
never
heard
of
a
child
who
asked
an
embarrassing
question
nor
have
we
known
of
anything
but
the
most
satisfactory
and
blessed
results
parents
will
find
beautiful
and
helpful
suggestions
in
teaching
truth
and
child
confidence
rewarded
two
booklets
by
mary
and
it
was
also
to
aid
parents
in
these
matters
that
what
a
young
boy
ought
to
know
and
what
a
young
girl
ought
to
know
were
written
parents
should
read
these
books
and
learn
how
to
communicate
the
information
either
in
conversation
or
by
reading
to
the
child
such
portions
as
are
suited
to
its
needs
remember
that
the
disposition
which
prompts
your
child
to
keep
an
unclean
thing
a
secret
from
you
will
also
incline
the
child
to
refrain
from
conversation
upon
a
pure
matter
which
is
to
be
a
secret
between
parent
and
child
if
you
allow
others
to
teach
your
child
sacred
truths
in
an
unhallowed
way
if
you
decline
to
give
your
children
an
honest
answer
to
their
honest
and
reasonable
inquiries
they
will
secure
in
its
degrading
form
from
vicious
companions
or
ignorant
servants
the
information
they
seek
it
is
infinitely
easier
to
keep
the
mind
of
the
child
pure
than
to
purify
it
after
it
has
been
polluted
when
corrupting
thoughts
and
degrading
pictures
have
been
painted
upon
the
canvas
of
the
mind
they
can
never
be
totally
obliterated
when
your
child
approaches
the
age
of
puberty
the
little
boy
becomes
awkward
his
voice
breaks
the
down
starts
upon
his
upper
lip
he
becomes
bashful
and
shrinking
at
that
trying
period
when
so
many
take
special
pleasure
in
taunting
and
tantalizing
at
that
period
of
special
stress
when
the
boy
and
the
girl
need
tenderness
see
to
it
that
your
children
are
protected
against
the
wrongs
to
which
others
are
subjected
this
is
the
period
in
the
life
of
the
boy
and
the
girl
when
they
are
not
able
to
understand
themselves
or
to
interpret
life
to
their
own
satisfaction
and
then
it
is
that
they
should
be
made
intelligent
upon
the
conditions
which
attend
the
transition
from
childhood
and
indicate
the
approach
of
manhood
and
womanhood
it
is
then
that
the
books
in
the
series
for
boys
and
girls
will
be
found
especially
indispensable
and
in
due
time
according
to
the
judgment
of
the
parents
should
be
followed
by
the
book
addressed
to
young
men
or
to
young
women
look
carefully
after
the
education
of
your
children
remember
that
the
the
the
evening
prayer
the
family
music
the
walk
the
ride
the
hasty
word
the
thoughtful
counsel
are
all
helping
to
educate
your
child
know
what
books
they
read
be
sure
that
in
the
public
schools
they
sit
under
the
instruction
of
no
one
who
insinuates
doubt
or
destroys
the
careful
and
sacred
instruction
of
the
home
when
evening
comes
and
evil
lurks
for
the
destruction
of
the
young
gather
your
children
about
you

your
home

attractive

them

it
be
the

and
source
of
that
which
is

inspire
them
to
noble
manhood
and
exalted
womanhood
regard
nothing
as
expensive
which
will
contribute
to
make
your
children
pure
and
good
and
great

your
children
may
be
guarded
against
the
errors
which
come
from

neither
at

nor
elsewhere
should
they

with

if
