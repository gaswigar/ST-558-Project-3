the
gray
mahatma
meldrum
strange
has
a
way
with
him
you
need
all
your
tact
to
get
him
past
the
quarreling
point
but
once
that
point
is
left
behind
there
is
a
finer
business
boss
in
the
universe
he
likes
to
put
his
ringer
on
a
and
feel
somebody
jump
in
tibet
or
or
honolulu
that
meldrum
strange
when
he
sent
me
from
san
francisco
where
i
was
enjoying
a
vacation
to
new
york
where
he
was
enjoying
business
i
took
the
first
train
you
been
a
long
time
on
the
way
he
remarked
as
i
walked
into
his
office
twenty
minutes
after
the
chicago
flyer
reached
grand
central
station
look
at
this
he
growled
shoving
into
my
hand
a
clipping
from
a
western
newspaper
what
about
it
i
asked
when
i
had
finished
reading
while
you
were
wasting
time
on
the
west
coast
this
office
has
been
busy
he
snorted
looking
more
like
general
grant
than
ever
as
he
pulled
out
a
cigar
and
started
chewing
it
we
taken
this
matter
up
with
the
british
government
and
we
been
retained
to
look
into
it
you
want
me
to
go
to
washington
i
suppose
you
got
to
go
to
india
at
once
that
clipping
is
two
months
old
i
answered
why
did
you
wire
me
when
i
was
in
egypt
to
go
on
from
there
look
at
this
he
answered
and
shoved
a
letter
across
the
desk
it
bore
the
address
of
a
club
in
simla

suggestion

name
of
a
british
cabinet

who

known
the
wide
world
over
that
i
am
making

king
etc

strange
that
the
fellow
who
went
to
khinjan
caves
the
best
secret
service
officer
the
british
ever
had
i
cabled
him
of
course
here
his
contract
you
take
it
to
him
the
whole
dope
about
this
propaganda
take
the
quickest
route
to
india
sign
up
this
man
king
and
go
after
them
at
that
end
for
all
the
two
of
you
are
worth
that
all
my
passport
being
unexpired
i
could
make
the
and
did
moreover
i
was
merciless
to
the
expense
account
an
aeroplane
took
me
from
liverpool
to
london
another
from
london
to
paris
i
do
care
how
often
you
arrive
in
bombay
the
thrill
increases
you
steam
in
at
dawn
by
gharipuri
just
as
the
gun
announces
sunrise
and
the
dreamy
bay
glimmers
like
a
prophet
vision
temples
domes
minarets
roofs
towers
and
masts
almost
before
the
anchor
had
splashed
into
the
water
off
the
apollo
bunder
a
native
boat
drew
alongside
and
a
very
native
climbed
up
the
in
quest
of
me
i
had
sent
king
a
wireless
but
his
messenger
was
away
in
advance
of
even
the
agents
who
flock
on
board
to
tout
for
customs
business
he
handed
me
a
letter
which
simply
said
that
the
bearer
gulab
lal
singh
would
look
after
me
and
my
belongings
so
i
paid
attention
to
the
man
he
was
a
strapping
fellow
handsome
as
the
deuce
with
a
roman
nose
and
the
eye
of
a
gentleman
unafraid
he
said
that
major
king
was
in
bombay
but
detained
by
urgent
business
however
he
invited
me
to
major
king
quarters
for
breakfast
so
instead
of
waiting
for
the
regular
launch
i
got
into
the
native
sailboat
with
him
and
he
seemed
to
have
some
sort
of
talisman
for
charming
officials
for
on
the
quay
an
officer
motioned
us
through
without
even
examining
my
passport
we
drew
up
finally
in
front
of
a
neat
little
bungalow
in
a
long
street
of
similar
buildings
intended
for
british
officials
gulab
lal
singh
took
me
straight
into
the
dining
room
and
carried
in
breakfast
with
his
own
hands
standing
behind
my
chair
in
silence
while
i
ate
without
much
effort
i
could
see
his
face
in
the
mirror
to
my
right
and
when
i
thought
he
was
noticing
i
studied
him
carefully
is
there
anything
further
that
the
would
care
for
he
asked
when
the
meal
was
finished
yes
i
said
pulling
out
an
envelope
here
your
contract
major
king
if
you
agreeable
we
may
as
well
get
that
signed
and
mailed
to
new
york
i
expected
to
see
him
look
surprised
but
he
simply
sat
down
at
the
table
read
the
contract
over
and
signed
it
then
we
went
out
on
to
a
veranda
that
was
shut
off
from
the
street
by
brown
how
long
does
it
take
you
to
grow
a
beard
was
his
first
rather
surprising
question
it
was
not
long
before
i
learned
how
differently
he
could
treat
different
individuals
he
had
simply
chosen
his
extraordinary
way
of
receiving
me
as
the
best
means
of
getting
a
real
line
on
me
without
much
loss
of
time
he
did
not
compliment
me
on
having
seen
through
his
disguise
or
apologize
for
his
own
failure
to
keep
up
the
deception
he
sat
opposite
and
studied
me
as
he
might
the
morning
newspaper
and
i
returned
the
compliment
you
see
he
said
suddenly
as
if
a
previous
conversation
had
been
interrupted
since
the
war
governments
have
lost
their
grip
so
i
resigned
from
the
army
you
look
to
me
like
a
kind
of
is
meldrum
strange
as
wealthy
as
they
say
i
nodded
is
he
playing
for
power
he
out
to
do
the
world
good
but
he
enjoys
the
feel
of
it
he
is
absolutely
on
the
level
i
have
a
letter
from
strange
in
which
he
says
you
hunted
and
prospected
all
over
the
world
does
that
include
india
i
nodded
know
any
of
the
languages
enough
hindustani
to
deceive
a
foreigner
punjabi
i
nodded
mind
you
i
was
supposed
to
be
this
fellow
boss
i
think
we
be
able
to
work
together
he
said
after
another
long
look
at
me
are
you
familiar
with
the
facts
he
asked
me
i
the
with
me
studied
it
on
the
ship
of
course
you
understand
then
the
princess
yasmini
and
the
gray
mahatma
are
the
two
keys
the
government
dare
arrest
either
because
it
would
inflame
there
too
much
of
that
already
i
not
in
position
to
play
this
game
alone
ca
afford
to
i
joined
the
firm
to
get
backing
for
what
i
want
to
do
i
like
that
point
clear
as
long
as
we
in
harness
together
i
take
you
into
confidence
but
i
expect
absolutely
free
rein
all
right
i
said
and
for
two
hours
he
unfolded
to
me
a
sort
of
panorama
of
indian
intrigue
including
dozens
of
statements
of
sheer
fact
that
not
one
person
in
a
million
would
believe
if
set
down
in
cold
print
so
you
see
he
said
at
last
there
something
needed
in
the
way
of
unobtrusive
inspection
if
the
rest
of
the
world
is
to
have
any
kind
of
breathing
spell
if
you
no
objection
we
leave
bombay
and
get
to
work
athelstan
king
and
i
arrived
after
certain
hot
days
and
choking
nights
at
a
city
in
the
punjab
that
has
had
nine
names
in
the
course
of
history
it
lies
by
a
winding
wide
river
whose
floods
have
changed
the
every
year
since
men
took
to
fighting
for
the
common
heritage
the
tremendous
wall
along
whose
base
the
river
sucks
and
sweeps
for
more
than
a
third
of
the
city
whole
circumference
has
to
be
kept
repaired
by
endless
labor
but
there
are
compensations
the
fierce
current
guards
and
gives
privacy
to
a
score
of
palaces
and
temples
as
well
as
a
burning
ghat
the
city
has
been
very
little
altered
by
the
vandal
hand
of
progress
there
is
a
red
steel
railway
bridge
but
the
same
framework
carries
a
from
the
bridge
northern
end
as
far
as
the
bazaar
the
main
street
goes
winding
roughly
parallel
with
the
waterfront
trees
arch
over
it
like
a
cathedral
roof
and
through
the
huge
branches
the
sun
turns
everything
beneath
to
gold
so
that
even
the
impious
sacred
monkeys
achieve
vicarious
beauty
and
the
scavenger
mongrel
dogs
scratch
sleep
and
are
miserable
in
an
aureole
there
are
modern
signs
as
for
instance
a
post
office
some
telegraph
wires
on
which
birds
of
a
thousand
colors
perch
with
an
air
of
perpetual
surprise
and
tucked
away
in
the
city
busiest
maze
not
four
hundred
yards
from
the
western
wall
the
office
of
the
sikh
apothecary
mulji
singh
mulji
singh
takes
life
seriously
which
is
a
laborious
thing
to
do
and
being
an
apostle
of
simple
sanitation
is
looked
at
askance
by
the
populace
but
he
persists
king
specialty
is
making
use
of
unconsidered
trifles
and
misunderstood
babus
king
was
attired
as
a
native
when
we
sought
out
mulji
singh
together
and
found
him
in
a
back
street
with
a
waiting
list
of
and
altogether
casteless
cripples
and
of
course
mulji
singh
had
all
the
gossip
of
the
city
at
his
ends
when
he
closed
his
office
at
last
and
we
came
inside
to
sit
with
him
he
loosed
his
tongue
and
would
have
told
us
everything
he
knew
if
king
had
not
steered
the
flow
of
information
between
channels
aye
and
this
mahatma
they
say
is
a
very
holy
fellow
who
works
miracles
sometimes
he
sits
under
a
tree
by
the
burning
ghat
but
at
night
he
goes
to
the
temple
of
the
tirthankers
where
none
dare
follow
him
although
they
sit
in
crowds
outside
to
watch
him
enter
and
leave
the
common
rumor
is
that
at
night
he
leaves
his
body
lifeless
in
a
crypt
in
that
tirthanker
temple
and
flies
to
heaven
where
he
fortifies
himself
with
fresh
magic
but
i
know
where
he
goes
by
night
there
comes
to
me
with
boils
a
sweeper
who
cleans
a
black
panther
cage
the
panther
took
his
other
leg
he
sleeps
in
a
cage
beside
the
panther
and
it
is
a
part
of
his
duty
to
turn
the
panther
loose
on
intruders
it
is
necessary
that
they
warn
this
fellow
whenever
a
stranger
is
expected
by
night
who
should
not
be
torn
to
pieces
night
after
night
he
is
warned
night
after
night
there
comes
this
mahatma
to
spend
the
hours
in
heaven
there
are
places
less
like
heaven
than
palace
is
he
your
only
informant
king
demanded
aye
the
only
one
on
that
count
but
there
is
another
whose
foot
was
caught
between
stone
and
stone
when
they
lowered
a
once
in
that
tirthanker
temple
he
bade
the
tirthankers
heal
his
foot
but
instead
they
threw
him
out
for
having
too
much
knowledge
of
matters
that
they
said
do
not
concern
him
and
he
says
that
the
opens
into
a
passage
that
leads
under
the
wall
into
a
chamber
from
which
access
is
obtained
by
another
to
a
building
inside
palace
grounds
within
a
of
that
panther
cage
and
he
too
says
that
the
mahatma
goes
nightly
to
palace
are
there
any
stories
of
king
inquired
thousands
but
no
two
agree
it
is
known
that
she
fell
foul
of
the
in
some
way
and
they
made
her
come
to
this
place
i
was
here
when
she
came
she
has
a
household
of
a
hundred
women
of
furniture
of
it
she
gave
orders
to
her
to
be
meek
and
inoffensive
so
when
they
moved
in
there
were
not
more
than
ten
fights
between
them
and
the
who
thought
they
had
as
much
right
to
the
streets
there
was
a
northern
devil
who
marshaled
the
and
it
is
he
who
keeps
her
palace
gate
he
keeps
it
well
none
trespass
what
other
visitors
does
she
entertain
besides
the
mahatma
many
though
few
enter
by
the
front
gate
there
are
tales
of
men
being
drawn
up
by
ropes
from
boats
in
the
river
is
there
word
of
why
they
come
the
little
naked
children
weave
stories
of
her
doings
each
has
a
different
tale
they
call
her
empress
of
the
hidden
arts
they
say
that
she
knows
all
the
secrets
of
the
priests
and
that
there
is
nothing
that
she
can
not
do
because
the
gods
love
her
and
the
male
evil
spirits
and
female
evil
spirits
do
her
bidding
what
about
this
tirthanker
temple
who
controls
it
none
knows
that
it
is
so
richly
endowed
that
its
priests
despise
men
gifts
none
is
encouraged
to
worship
in
that
place
when
those
old
tirthankers
stir
abroad
they
have
no
dealings
with
folk
in
this
city
that
any
man
knows
of
are
you
sure
they
are
tirthankers
asked
king
i
am
sure
of
nothing
for
aught
i
know
they
are
king
gave
him
a
small
sum
of
money
and
we
walked
away
toward
the
burning
ghat
where
there
was
nothing
but
a
mean
smell
and
a
few
old
men
with
rakes
gathering
up
ashes
but
outside
the
ghat
where
a
golden
mohur
tree
cast
a
wide
shadow
across
the
road
there
was
a
large
crowd
sitting
and
standing
in
rings
around
an
absolutely
naked
religious
fanatic
the
fanatic
appeared
to
have
the
crowd
bewildered
for
he
cursed
and
blessed
on
no
comprehensible
schedule
and
gave
extraordinary
answers
to
the
simplest
questions
not
acknowledging
a
question
at
all
unless
it
suited
him
king
and
i
had
not
been
there
a
minute
before
some
one
asked
him
about
the
princess
yasmini
aha
who
stares
at
the
fire
burns
his
eyes
a
burned
eye
is
of
less
use
than
a
raw
one
some
laughed
but
not
many
most
of
them
seemed
to
think
there
was
deep
wisdom
in
his
answer
to
be
dug
for
meditatively
as
no
doubt
there
was
then
a
man
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
a
long
way
off
from
me
who
wore
the
air
of
a
humorist
asked
him
about
me
does
the
shadow
of
this
foreigner
offend
your
honor
holiness
none
glanced
in
my
direction
that
might
have
given
the
game
away
it
is
considered
an
exquisite
joke
to
discuss
a
white
man
to
his
face
without
his
knowing
it
the
gray
mahatma
did
not
glance
in
my
direction
either
as
a
bird
in
the
river
as
a
fish
in
the
air
as
a
man
in
trouble
is
the
foreigner
in
hind
he
answered
then
he
suddenly
began
declaiming
making
his
voice
ring
as
if
his
throat
were
brass
yet
without
moving
his
body
or
shifting
his
head
by
a
hair
breadth
the
universe
was
chaos
said
let
order
prevail
and
order
came
out
of
the
chaos
and
prevailed
the
universe
was
in
darkness
said
let
there
be
light
and
let
it
prevail
over
darkness
and
light
came
out
of
the
womb
of
darkness
and
prevailed
ordained
the
an
age
of
darkness
in
which
all
hind
should
lie
at
the
feet
of
foreigners
and
thus
ye
lie
in
the
dust
but
there
is
an
end
of
night
and
so
there
is
an
end
to
bide
ye
the
time
and
watch
king
drew
me
away
and
we
returned
between
old
temples
and
new
stores
toward
mulji
singh
quarters
where
he
had
left
the
traveling
bag
that
we
shared
between
us
is
that
gray
mahatma
linked
up
with
propaganda
in
the
i
asked
wondering
what
more
king
answered
he
dangerous
he
sincere
the
most
dangerous
type
of
politician
in
the
world
the
honest
visionary
in
love
with
an
abstract
theory
capable
of
offering
himself
for
martyrdom
watch
him
now
the
crowd
was
beginning
to
close
in
on
the
mahatma
seeking
to
touch
him
suddenly
he
flew
into
a
fury
seized
a
long
stick
from
some
one
near
him
and
began
beating
them
over
the
head
using
both
hands
and
laying
on
so
savagely
that
ashes
fell
from
him
like
from
a
shaken
bag
and
several
men
ran
away
with
the
blood
pouring
down
their
faces
however
they
were
reckoned
fortunate
some
of
those
will
charge
money
to
let
other
fools
touch
them
said
king
come
on
let
call
on
now
so
we
returned
to
mulji
singh
stuffy
little
office
and
king
changed
into
a
major
uniform
it
is
exactly
according
to
hoyle
to
wear
this
he
explained
however
she
does
know
i
resigned
from
the
army
chapter
ii
the
palace
of
yasmini
nobody
saw
us
walk
up
to
yasmini
palace
gate
and
knock
for
whoever
was
abroad
in
the
heat
was
down
by
the
ghat
admiring
the
mahatma
the
bearded
giant
who
had
admitted
us
stood
staring
at
king
his
long
strong
fingers
twitching
in
his
own
good
time
king
turned
and
saw
fit
to
recognize
him
oh
hullo
ismail
he
held
a
hand
out
but
the
savage
flung
arms
about
him
that
were
as
strong
as
the
iron
and
king
had
to
fight
to
break
free
from
the
embrace
now
allah
be
praised
he
is
father
of
mercies
warned
me
he
croaked
she
knows
the
smell
of
dawn
at
midnight
she
said
cometh
soon
and
none
believed
her
save
only
i
this
very
dawn
said
she
ismail
she
said
asleep
at
the
gate
when
he
cometh
and
thine
eyes
shall
be
thrown
to
the
city
dogs
aye
oho
king
nodded
to
lead
on
and
ismail
obeyed
with
a
deal
of
pantomime
intended
to
convey
a
sense
of
partnership
with
roots
in
the
past
and
its
fruition
now
the
way
was
down
a
passage
between
high
carved
walls
so
old
that
antiquarians
burn
friendship
in
disputes
not
so
much
about
the
century
as
the
very
era
of
that
quiet
art
under
dark
arches
with
latticed
windows
into
unexpected
gardens
fresh
with
the
smell
of
sprinkled
water
by
ancient
bronze
gateways
into
other
passages
that
opened
into
courts
with
fountains
in
the
midst
building
joining
on
to
building
and
court
meeting
court
until
where
an
old
black
panther
snarled
at
us
between
iron
bars
an
arch
and
a
solid
bronze
door
admitted
us
at
last
into
the
woman
pleasance
a
wonderland
of
jasmine
magnolia
and
pomegranates
set
about
a
marble
pool
and
therein
mirrored
among
fishes
beyond
the
pool
a
flight
of
marble
steps
rose
fifty
feet
until
it
passed
through
a
wall
into
the
the
quarters
of
the
women
at
their
foot
ismail
halted
go
thou
up
alone
leave
this
elephant
with
me
he
said
nudging
me
and
pointing
with
his
thumb
toward
a
shady
bower
against
the
garden
wall
without
acknowledging
that
pleasantry
king
took
my
arm
and
we
went
straight
forward
together
our
tread
resounding
strangely
on
steps
that
for
centuries
had
felt
no
sterner
shock
than
that
of
soft
slippers
and
naked
jeweled
feet
we
were
taking
nobody
entirely
by
surprise
that
much
was
obvious
before
we
reached
the
top
step
two
women
opened
a
door
and
ran
to
meet
us
one
woman
threw
over
king
head
such
a
prodigious
garland
of
jasmine
buds
that
he
had
to
loop
it
thrice
about
his
shoulders
then
each
took
a
hand
of
one
of
us
and
we
entered
between
doors
of
wood
treading
on
marble
their
bare
feet
pattering
beside
ours
there
were
rustlings
to
right
and
left
and
once
i
heard
laughter
smothered
instantly
at
last
at
the
end
of
a
wide
hall
before
silken
curtains
our
two
guides
stopped
as
they
released
our
hands
with
the
always
surprising
strength
that
is
part
of
the
dancing
woman
they
slipped
behind
us
suddenly
and
thrust
us
forward
through
the
curtains
there
was
not
much
to
see
in
front
of
us
we
found
ourselves
in
a
paneled
corridor
whose
narrow
windows
overlooked
the
river
facing
a
painted
door
sixty
paces
distant
at
the
farther
end
king
strode
down
the
corridor
and
knocked
the
answer
was
one
word
that
i
did
not
catch
although
it
rang
like
a
suddenly
struck
chord
of
music
and
the
door
yielded
to
the
pressure
of
king
hand
i
entered
behind
him
and
the
door
swung
shut
of
its
own
weight
with
a
click
we
were
in
a
very
long
room
having
seven
sides
there
were
windows
to
right
and
left
a
deep
divan
piled
with
scented
cushions
occupied
the
whole
length
of
one
long
wall
and
there
were
several
huge
cushions
on
the
floor
against
another
wall
there
was
one
other
door
besides
that
we
had
entered
by
we
stood
in
that
room
alone
but
i
know
that
king
felt
as
uneasy
as
i
did
for
there
was
sweat
on
the
back
of
his
neck
we
were
being
watched
by
unseen
eyes
there
is
no
mistaking
that
sensation
suddenly
a
voice
broke
silence
like
a
golden
bell
whose
overtones
go
widening
in
rings
into
infinity
and
a
vision
of
loveliness
parted
the
curtains
of
that
other
door
my
lord
comes
as
is
meet
spurred
and
ready
to
give
new
kingdoms
to
his
king
oh
how
my
lord
is
welcome
she
said
in
persian
her
voice
thrilled
you
because
of
its
perfect
resonance
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
note
she
looked
into
king
eyes
with
challenging
familiarity
that
made
him
smile
and
then
eyed
me
wonderingly
she
glanced
from
me
to
a
picture
on
the
wall
in
blue
of
the
enormous
opulent
urbane
and
then
back
again
at
me
and
smiled
very
sweetly
so
you
have
brought
ganesha
with
you
the
god
of
good
luck
how
wonderful
how
does
one
behave
toward
a
real
god
and
while
she
said
that
she
laid
her
hands
on
king
arms
as
naturally
as
if
he
were
a
lover
whom
she
had
not
seen
perhaps
since
yesterday
plainly
there
was
absolutely
nothing
between
him
and
her
except
his
own
obstinate
independence
she
was
his
if
he
wanted
her
she
took
king
hand
with
a
laugh
that
had
its
roots
in
past
companionship
and
led
him
to
the
middle
deepest
beneath
which
the
river
could
be
heard
gurgling
busily
then
when
she
had
drawn
the
silken
hangings
until
the
softened
light
suggested
lingering
uncounted
hours
and
had
indicated
with
a
nod
to
me
a
cushion
in
the
corner
she
came
and
lay
on
the
cushions
close
to
king
chin
on
hand
where
she
could
watch
his
eyes
king
sat
straight
and
square
watching
her
with
caution
that
he
did
not
trouble
to
conceal
she
took
his
hand
and
raised
the
sleeve
until
the
broad
gold
graven
bracelet
showed
that
link
forged
in
the
past
must
bind
us
two
more
surely
than
an
oath
she
said
smiling
i
used
it
to
show
to
the
gatekeeper
he
sat
cooly
waiting
for
her
next
remark
and
with
almost
unnecessary
candor
began
to
remove
the
bracelet
and
offer
it
back
to
her
so
she
unmasked
her
batteries
with
a
delicious
little
rippling
laugh
and
a
lazy
movement
that
betokened
joy
in
the
danger
that
was
coming
if
i
know
anything
at
all
of
what
means
i
knew
that
very
day
that
you
resigned
your
commission
in
the
army
and
i
laughed
with
delight
at
the
news
knowing
that
the
gods
who
are
our
servants
had
contrived
it
i
know
why
thou
art
here
she
said
and
the
change
from
you
to
thou
was
not
haphazard
it
is
well
known
princess
that
your
spies
are
the
cleverest
in
india
king
answered
spies
i
need
no
spies
as
long
as
old
india
lives
friends
are
better
do
all
princesses
break
their
promises
he
countered
meeting
her
eyes
steadily
never
yet
did
i
break
one
promise
whether
it
was
for
good
or
evil
princess
he
answered
looking
sternly
at
her
in
jamrud
fort
you
agreed
to
take
no
part
again
in
politics
national
or
international
in
return
for
a
promise
of
personal
freedom
and
permission
to
reside
in
india
my
promise
was
dependent
on
my
liberty
but
is
this
liberty
to
be
forced
to
reside
in
this
old
palace
with
the
spies
of
the
government
keeping
watch
on
my
doings
except
when
they
chance
to
be
outwitted
nevertheless
i
have
kept
my
promise
thou
knowest
me
better
than
to
think
that
i
need
to
break
promises
in
order
to
outwit
a
government
of
englishmen
quibbles
wo
help
princess
he
answered
you
promised
to
do
nothing
that
government
might
object
to
well
will
they
object
to
my
religion
she
retorted
mocking
him
has
the
british
at
last
screwed
up
its
courage
to
the
point
of
trespassing
behind
the
purdah
and
blundering
in
among
religious
exercises
no
man
in
his
senses
ever
challenges
a
woman
argument
until
he
knows
the
whole
of
it
and
has
unmasked
its
ulterior
purpose
so
king
sat
still
and
said
nothing
knowing
that
that
was
precisely
what
she
did
not
want
you
must
make
terms
with
me
she
went
on
changing
her
tone
to
one
of
rather
more
suggestive
firmness
the
age
of
darkness
is
drawing
to
a
close
and
india
awakes
there
is
froth
on
the
surface
a
rising
here
an
agitation
there
a
deal
of
wild
talk
everywhere
and
the
dead
old
government
proposes
to
suppress
it
in
the
dead
old
ways
like
men
with
paddles
seeking
to
beat
the
waves
down
flat
but
the
winds
of
god
blow
and
the
boat
of
the
men
with
the
paddles
will
be
upset
presently
who
then
shall
ride
the
storm
their
gunners
will
be
told
to
shoot
the
froth
as
it
forms
and
rises
but
if
there
is
a
wise
man
anywhere
he
will
make
terms
with
me
and
will
set
himself
to
guide
the
underlying
forces
that
may
otherwise
whelm
everything
i
think
thou
art
wise
my
thou
wert
wise
once
on
a
time
do
you
think
you
can
rule
india
king
asked
her
and
he
did
not
make
the
mistake
of
suggesting
ridicule
who
else
can
do
it
she
retorted
do
you
think
we
come
into
the
world
to
let
fate
be
our
master
why
have
i
royal
blood
and
royal
views
wealth
understanding
and
ambition
while
the
others
have
blindness
and
vague
yearnings
can
you
answer
princess
he
answered
i
had
only
one
object
in
coming
here
i
know
that
she
said
nodding
i
have
simply
come
to
warn
you
she
answered
with
her
chin
between
her
hands
and
her
elbows
deep
in
the
cushions
i
know
how
much
is
known
this
man
what
is
his
name
ramsden
pouff
ganesha
here
is
far
better
ganesha
is
from
america
those
fools
who
went
to
prepare
the
american
mind
for
what
is
coming
because
they
were
altogether
too
foolish
to
be
anything
but
in
the
way
in
india
have
been
found
out
and
ganesha
has
come
like
a
big
to
save
the
world
by
thrusting
his
clumsy
horns
into
things
he
does
not
understand
i
tell
you
athelstan
that
however
much
is
known
there
is
much
more
that
is
not
known
you
would
better
make
terms
with
me
what
you
must
understand
princess
is
that
your
plan
to
overthrow
the
west
and
make
the
east
the
world
controlling
force
is
known
by
those
who
can
prevent
you
he
answered
quietly
you
see
i
ca
go
away
from
here
and
tell
whoever
asks
me
that
you
are
observing
your
promise
to
no
she
interrupted
with
a
ringing
merry
laugh
of
triumph
you
speak
truth
without
knowing
it
you
can
not
go
away
princess
yasmini
boast
was
good
but
we
had
come
to
solve
a
problem
not
to
run
away
with
it
and
she
looked
disconcerted
by
our
rather
obvious
willingness
to
be
her
prisoners
for
a
while
do
you
think
i
can
not
be
cruel
she
asked
suddenly
i
have
seen
you
at
your
worst
as
well
as
at
your
best
king
answered
you
act
like
a
man
who
has
resources
yet
you
have
none
she
answered
slowly
as
if
reviewing
all
the
situation
in
her
mind
none
knows
where
you
are
not
even
mulji
singh
with
whom
you
left
your
other
clothes
before
putting
on
that
uniform
the
better
to
impress
me
the
bag
that
you
and
ganesha
share
between
you
like
two
mendicants
emerging
from
the
jail
is
now
in
a
room
in
this
palace
you
came
because
you
saw
that
if
i
should
be
arrested
there
would
be
insurrection
you
said
so
to
ommony
sahib
and
his
butler
overheard
but
not
even
ommony
knows
where
you
are
he
said
to
you
you
can
defeat
that
woman
without
using
violence
you
stand
alone
in
the
world
as
the
one
man
who
could
do
it
but
if
you
use
violence
though
you
kill
her
she
will
defeat
you
and
all
the
rest
of
us
is
not
that
what
your
friend
ommony
said
what
kind
of
terms
do
you
want
me
to
make
with
you
princess
king
answered
i
can
make
you
ruler
of
all
india
she
said
another
may
wear
the
baubles
but
thou
shalt
be
the
true
king
even
as
thy
name
is
and
behind
thee
me
yasmini
whispering
wisdom
and
laughing
to
see
the
politicians
strut
king
leaned
back
and
laughed
at
her
do
you
really
expect
me
to
help
you
ruin
my
own
countrymen
go
back
on
my
color
creed
education
oath
and
everything
and
deluded
fools
the
east
the
east
athelstan
is
waking
better
make
terms
with
me
and
thou
shalt
live
to
ride
on
the
arising
east
as
god
rides
on
the
wind
and
bits
and
governs
it
very
well
he
said
show
me
i
do
nothing
blindfold
hah
thou
art
not
yet
she
laughed
and
what
of
ganesha
is
this
mountain
of
bones
and
thews
a
person
to
be
trusted
or
shall
we
show
him
how
much
stronger
than
him
is
a
horsehair
in
a
clever
woman
fingers
this
man
ramsden
is
my
friend
king
said
are
you
friend
she
retorted
he
nodded
you
are
going
to
see
the
naked
heart
of
india
she
said
better
to
have
your
eyes
burned
out
now
than
see
that
and
be
false
to
it
afterward
then
since
we
failed
to
order
needles
for
our
eyes
she
cried
out
once
one
clear
note
that
sounded
almost
exactly
as
if
she
had
struck
a
silver
gong
a
woman
entered
like
the
living
echo
to
it
yasmini
spoke
and
the
woman
disappeared
again
below
us
the
river
swallowed
and
gurgled
along
the
palace
wall
and
we
caught
the
occasional
thumping
of
a
the
thumping
ceased
exactly
underneath
us
and
a
man
began
singing
in
the
language
of
rajasthan
i
think
he
was
looking
upward
as
he
sang
for
each
word
reached
its
goal
oh
warm
and
broad
the
plow
land
lies
the
idle
oxen
wait
we
pray
thee
holy
river
rise
nor
glut
thy
fields
too
late
the
year
awakes
the
slumbering
seed
swells
to
its
birth
oh
river
heed
strange
time
of
year
for
that
song
princess
is
that
one
of
your
spies
asked
king
not
too
politely
one
of
my
friends
she
answered
i
told
you
india
awakes
but
watch
it
was
growing
dark
two
women
came
and
drew
the
curtains
closer
other
women
brought
lamps
and
set
them
on
stools
along
one
wall
others
again
brought
tapers
and
lit
the
candles
in
the
candelabra
it
is
really
too
light
yet
yasmini
grumbled
as
if
the
gods
who
marshal
in
the
night
had
not
kept
faith
with
her
but
even
so
the
shadows
danced
among
india
gods
on
the
wall
facing
the
row
of
stools
then
there
began
music
made
by
musicians
out
of
sight
low
and
sweet
suggesting
unimaginable
mysteries
and
one
by
one
through
the
curtains
opposite
there
came
in
silently
seven
women
on
bare
feet
that
hardly
touched
the
carpet
and
all
the
stories
about
nautch
girls
all
the
travelers
tales
of
how
eastern
women
dance
with
their
arms
not
feet
vanished
that
instant
into
the
kingdom
of
lies
this
was
dancing
art
absolute
they
no
longer
seemed
to
be
flesh
and
blood
women
possessed
of
weight
and
other
limitations
their
footfall
was
hardly
audible
and
you
could
not
hear
them
breathe
at
all
they
were
like
living
shadows
and
they
danced
the
way
the
shadows
of
the
branches
do
on
a
jungle
clearing
when
a
light
breeze
makes
the
trees
laugh
it
had
some
sort
of
mystic
meaning
no
doubt
although
i
did
not
understand
it
but
what
i
did
understand
was
that
the
whole
arrangement
was
designed
to
produce
a
sort
of
mesmerism
in
the
beholder
however
school
yourself
to
live
alone
and
think
alone
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
or
so
meeting
people
only
as
man
to
man
instead
of
like
a
sheep
among
a
flock
of
sheep
and
you
become
immune
to
that
sort
of
thing
the
princess
yasmini
seemed
to
realize
that
neither
king
nor
i
were
being
drawn
into
the
net
of
dreaminess
that
those
trained
women
of
hers
were
weaving
watch
said
yasmini
suddenly
and
then
we
saw
what
very
few
men
have
been
priviliged
to
see
she
joined
the
dance
and
you
knew
then
who
had
taught
those
women
theirs
had
been
after
all
a
mere
interpretation
of
her
vision
hers
was
the
vision
itself
she
was
the
thing
itself
no
more
an
interpretation
than
anything
in
nature
is
yasmini
became
india
india
heart
and
i
suppose
that
if
king
and
i
had
understood
her
we
would
have
been
swept
into
her
vortex
as
it
were
like
drops
of
water
into
an
ocean
she
was
unrestrained
by
any
need
or
even
willingness
to
explain
herself
she
was
talking
the
same
language
that
the
nodding
blossoms
and
the
light
and
shadow
talk
that
go
chasing
each
other
across
the
hillsides
and
while
you
watched
you
seemed
to
know
all
sorts
of
things
secrets
that
disappeared
from
your
mind
a
moment
afterward
she
began
singing
presently
commencing
on
the
middle
f
as
every
sound
in
nature
does
and
disregarding
conventional
limitations
just
as
she
did
when
dancing
she
sang
first
of
the
emptiness
before
the
worlds
were
made
she
sang
of
the
birth
of
peoples
of
the
history
of
peoples
she
sang
of
india
as
the
mother
of
all
speech
song
race
and
knowledge
of
truths
that
every
great
thinker
since
the
world
beginning
has
propounded
and
of
india
as
the
home
of
all
of
them
until
whether
you
would
or
not
at
least
you
seemed
to
see
the
undeniable
truth
of
that
and
then
in
a
weird
wild
melancholy
minor
key
came
the
story
of
the
the
age
of
darkness
creeping
over
india
condemning
her
for
her
sins
she
sang
of
india
under
the
hoof
of
ugliness
and
ignorance
and
plague
and
yet
of
a
few
who
kept
the
old
light
burning
in
secret
of
hidden
books
and
of
stuff
that
men
call
magic
handed
down
the
centuries
from
lip
to
lip
in
caves
and
temple
cellars
and
mountain
fastnesses
wherever
the
mysteries
were
safe
from
profane
eyes
and
then
the
key
changed
again
striking
that
fundamental
middle
f
that
is
the
of
all
the
voices
of
nature
and
as
indians
maintain
of
the
music
of
the
spheres
as
well
music
and
song
and
dance
became
laughter
doubt
vanished
for
there
seemed
nothing
left
to
doubt
as
she
began
to
sing
of
india
rising
at
last
again
triumphant
over
darkness
mother
of
the
world
and
of
all
the
nations
of
the
world
awake
unconquerable
never
was
another
song
like
that
one
nor
was
there
ever
such
a
climax
as
she
finished
on
a
chord
of
triumph
that
seemed
like
a
new
spirit
bursting
the
bonds
of
ancient
mystery
and
sank
to
the
floor
among
her
women
there
stood
the
gray
mahatma
in
their
midst
not
naked
any
longer
but
clothed
from
head
to
heel
in
a
robe
and
without
his
paste
of
ashes
he
stood
like
a
statue
with
folded
arms
his
yellow
eyes
blazing
and
his
look
like
a
lion
and
how
he
had
entered
the
room
i
confess
i
know
to
this
hour
nor
does
athelstan
king
who
is
a
trained
observer
of
unusual
happenings
both
doors
were
closed
and
i
will
take
oath
that
neither
had
been
opened
since
the
women
entered
peace
was
his
first
word
spoken
like
one
in
authority
who
ordered
peace
and
dared
to
do
it
he
stood
looking
for
more
than
a
minute
at
king
and
me
with
i
think
just
a
flicker
of
scorn
on
his
thin
lips
as
if
he
were
wondering
whether
we
were
men
enough
to
face
the
ordeal
before
us
then
indefinably
yet
quite
perceptibly
his
mood
changed
and
his
appearance
with
it
he
held
his
right
hand
out
will
you
not
shake
hands
with
me
he
asked
smiling
now
that
was
a
thing
that
no
sanctimonious
brahman
would
have
dreamed
of
doing
for
fear
of
being
defiled
by
the
touch
of
a
casteless
foreigner
so
he
was
either
above
or
below
the
caste
laws
and
it
is
common
knowledge
how
those
who
are
below
caste
cringe
and
toady
so
he
evidently
reckoned
himself
above
it
and
the
indian
who
can
do
that
has
met
and
overcome
more
tyranny
and
terrors
than
the
west
knows
anything
about
i
wish
i
could
make
exactly
clear
what
happened
when
i
took
his
outstretched
hand
his
fingers
closed
on
mine
with
a
grip
like
marble
there
are
few
men
who
are
stronger
than
i
am
i
can
outlift
a
stage
professional
yet
i
could
no
more
move
his
hand
or
pull
mine
free
than
if
he
had
been
a
bronze
image
with
my
hand
set
solid
in
the
casting
that
is
for
your
own
good
he
said
pleasantly
letting
go
at
last
that
other
man
knows
better
but
you
might
have
been
so
unwise
as
to
try
using
violence
i
glad
you
had
that
experience
said
king
in
a
low
voice
as
i
went
back
to
the
do
let
yourself
be
bewildered
by
it
there
an
explanation
for
everything
they
know
something
that
we
do
that
all
chapter
iii
fear
is
death
at
a
sign
from
the
gray
mahatma
all
the
women
except
yasmini
left
the
room
yasmini
seemed
to
be
in
a
strange
mood
mixed
of
mischief
and
amused
anticipation
the
mahatma
sat
down
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
carpet
and
his
method
was
unique
it
looked
just
as
if
an
unseen
hand
had
taken
him
by
the
hair
and
lowered
him
gradually
for
he
crossed
his
legs
and
dropped
to
the
floor
as
evenly
and
slowly
as
one
of
those
freight
elevators
that
disappear
beneath
the
city
he
seemed
to
attach
a
great
deal
of
importance
to
his
exact
position
and
glanced
repeatedly
at
the
walls
as
if
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
sitting
an
inch
or
two
too
far
to
the
right
or
left
however
he
had
gauged
his
measurements
exactly
at
the
first
attempt
and
did
not
move
once
he
was
seated
you
two
he
began
with
a
slight
emphasis
on
the
word
as
if
he
wished
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
was
according
us
due
courtesy
you
two
honorable
gentlemen
he
continued
as
if
mere
courtesy
perhaps
were
not
enough
have
been
chosen
unknown
to
yourselves
for
there
is
but
one
chooser
whose
choice
is
never
known
until
the
hour
comes
for
the
chosen
there
is
no
road
back
again
even
if
you
should
prefer
death
your
death
could
not
now
be
of
your
own
choosing
for
having
been
chosen
there
is
no
escape
from
service
to
the
purpose
and
though
you
would
certainly
die
if
courage
failed
you
your
death
would
be
more
terrible
than
life
since
it
would
serve
the
purpose
without
benefiting
you
you
are
both
honest
men
he
continued
for
the
one
has
resigned
honors
and
emoluments
in
the
army
for
the
sake
of
serving
india
the
other
has
accepted
toilsome
service
under
a
man
who
seeks
however
mistakenly
to
serve
the
world
if
you
were
not
honest
you
would
never
have
been
chosen
if
you
had
made
no
sacrifices
of
your
own
free
will
you
would
not
have
been
acceptable
yasmini
clasped
her
hands
and
laid
her
chin
on
them
among
the
cushions
she
was
reveling
in
intellectual
enjoyment
as
sinfully
i
daresay
as
some
folk
revel
in
more
material
delights
the
mahatma
took
no
notice
of
her
but
continued
you
have
heard
of
the
the
age
of
darkness
it
is
at
an
end
the
nations
presently
begin
to
beat
swords
into
plowshares
because
the
time
has
come
but
there
is
yet
much
else
to
do
and
the
eyes
of
those
who
have
lived
so
long
in
darkness
are
but
blinded
for
the
present
by
the
light
so
that
guides
are
needed
who
can
see
you
two
shall
see
a
little
it
was
becoming
intolerably
hot
in
the
room
with
the
curtains
drawn
and
all
those
lights
burning
but
i
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
who
minded
it
the
candles
in
the
chandelier
were
kept
from
collapsing
by
metal
sheaths
but
the
very
flames
seemed
to
feel
the
heat
and
to
flicker
like
living
things
that
wilted
corn
is
corn
and
grass
is
grass
said
the
mahatma
and
neither
one
can
change
the
other
yet
the
seed
of
grass
that
is
selected
can
improve
all
grass
as
they
understand
who
strive
with
problems
of
the
field
therefore
ye
two
who
have
been
chosen
shall
be
sent
as
the
seeds
of
grass
to
the
united
states
to
carry
on
the
work
that
no
indian
can
properly
accomplish
corn
to
corn
grass
to
grass
that
is
your
destiny
he
paused
as
if
waiting
for
the
sand
to
run
out
of
an
there
was
no
but
the
suggestion
was
there
just
the
same
nevertheless
he
went
on
presently
there
are
some
who
fail
their
destiny
even
as
some
chosen
seeds
refuse
to
sprout
you
will
need
besides
your
honesty
such
courage
as
is
committed
to
few
once
on
a
time
before
the
began
when
the
aryans
of
whom
you
people
are
descendants
lived
in
this
ancient
motherland
the
whole
of
all
knowledge
was
the
heritage
of
every
man
and
what
are
called
miracles
were
understood
as
natural
working
of
pure
law
it
was
nothing
in
those
days
for
a
man
to
walk
through
fire
unscathed
for
there
was
very
little
difference
between
the
gods
and
men
and
men
knew
themselves
for
masters
of
the
universe
subject
only
to
nevertheless
the
sons
of
men
grew
blind
mistaking
the
shadow
for
the
substance
and
because
the
least
error
when
extended
to
infinity
produces
chaos
the
whole
world
became
chaos
full
of
nothing
but
rivalries
sickness
hate
confusion
meanwhile
the
sons
of
men
ever
seeking
the
light
they
lost
have
spread
around
the
earth
ever
mistaking
the
shadow
for
the
substance
until
they
have
imitated
the
very
thunder
and
lightning
calling
them
cannon
they
have
imitated
all
the
forces
of
the
universe
and
called
them
steam
gasoline
electricity
chemistry
and
what
not
so
that
now
they
fly
by
machinery
who
once
could
fly
without
effort
and
without
wings
and
now
they
grow
deathly
weary
not
understanding
why
now
they
hold
councils
one
nation
with
another
seeking
to
substitute
a
lesser
evil
for
the
greater
once
in
every
hundred
years
men
have
been
sent
forth
to
prove
by
public
demonstration
that
there
is
a
greater
science
than
all
that
are
called
sciences
none
knew
when
the
end
of
the
might
be
and
it
was
thought
that
if
men
saw
things
they
could
not
explain
perhaps
they
would
turn
and
seek
the
true
mastery
of
the
universe
but
what
happened
you
who
are
from
america
is
there
one
village
in
all
america
where
men
do
not
speak
of
indians
as
fakirs
and
for
that
there
are
two
reasons
one
is
that
there
are
multitudes
of
indians
who
are
thieves
and
liars
who
know
nothing
and
seek
to
conceal
their
ignorance
beneath
a
cloak
of
deceit
and
trickery
the
other
is
that
men
are
so
deep
in
delusion
that
when
they
do
see
the
unexplainable
they
seek
to
explain
it
away
whereas
the
truth
is
that
there
are
natural
laws
which
if
understood
by
all
would
at
once
make
all
men
masters
of
the
universe
i
will
give
you
an
example
they
are
using
wireless
telephones
who
twenty
years
ago
would
have
mocked
whoever
had
suggested
such
a
thing
yet
it
is
common
knowledge
that
forty
years
ago
for
instance
when
roberts
the
british
general
led
an
army
into
afghanistan
in
wintertime
and
fought
a
battle
at
kandahar
the
news
of
his
victory
was
known
in
bombay
a
thousand
miles
away
as
soon
as
it
had
happened
whereas
the
government
possessing
semaphores
and
the
telegraph
had
to
wait
many
days
for
the
news
how
did
that
occur
can
you
or
any
one
explain
it
footnote
this
is
incontestably
historical
fact
see
lord
book
years
in
if
i
were
to
go
forth
and
tell
how
it
happened
the
men
who
profit
by
the
telegraphs
and
the
cables
would
desire
to
kill
me
there
is
only
one
country
in
the
world
where
such
things
can
be
successfully
explained
and
that
is
india
but
not
even
in
india
until
india
is
free
when
the
millions
of
india
once
grasp
the
fact
of
freedom
they
will
forget
superstition
and
understand
then
they
will
claim
their
powers
and
use
them
then
the
world
will
see
and
wonder
and
presently
the
world
too
will
understand
therefore
india
must
be
free
these
three
hundred
and
fifty
million
people
who
speak
one
hundred
and
languages
must
be
set
free
to
work
out
their
own
destiny
but
there
is
only
one
way
of
doing
that
the
world
and
india
with
it
is
held
in
the
grip
of
delusion
and
what
is
delusion
nothing
but
opinions
therefore
it
is
opinions
that
hold
india
in
subjection
and
opinions
must
be
changed
a
beginning
must
be
made
where
opinions
are
least
hidebound
and
are
therefore
easiest
to
change
that
means
america
therefore
you
two
are
chosen
one
who
knows
and
loves
india
one
who
knows
and
loves
america
the
duty
laid
on
you
is
absolute
there
can
be
no
flinching
from
it
you
are
to
go
to
america
and
convince
americans
that
india
should
be
free
to
work
out
her
own
destiny
therefore
follow
and
see
what
you
shall
see
he
rose
exactly
as
he
had
sat
down
without
apparent
muscular
effort
it
was
as
if
a
hand
had
taken
him
by
the
scalp
and
lifted
him
except
that
i
noticed
his
feet
were
pressed
so
hard
against
the
floor
that
the
blood
left
them
so
that
i
think
the
secret
of
the
trick
was
perfect
muscular
control
although
how
to
attain
that
is
another
matter
the
princess
yasmini
made
no
offer
to
come
with
us
but
lounged
among
the
cushions
reveling
in
mischievous
enjoyment
whatever
the
gray
mahatma
real
motive
there
was
no
possible
doubt
about
hers
she
was
looking
forward
to
a
tangible
material
profit
the
gray
mahatma
led
the
way
through
the
door
by
which
we
had
entered
stalking
along
in
his
saffron
robe
without
the
slightest
effort
to
seem
dignified
or
solemn
keep
your
wits
about
you
king
whispered
and
then
again
presently
do
be
fooled
into
thinking
that
anything
you
see
is
supernatural
remember
that
whatever
you
see
is
simply
the
result
of
something
that
they
know
and
that
we
do
keep
your
hair
on
we
going
to
see
some
wonderful
stuff
or
i
a
dutchman
we
passed
down
the
long
corridor
outside
yasmini
room
but
instead
of
continuing
straight
forward
the
gray
mahatma
found
an
opening
behind
a
curtain
in
a
wall
whose
thickness
could
be
only
guessed
inside
the
wall
was
a
stairway
six
feet
wide
that
descended
to
an
echoing
unfurnished
hall
below
after
making
two
turns
inside
solid
masonry
the
lower
hall
was
dark
but
he
found
his
way
without
difficulty
picking
up
a
lantern
from
a
corner
on
his
way
and
then
opening
a
door
that
gave
underneath
the
outer
marble
stairway
on
to
the
court
where
the
pool
and
the
flowering
shrubs
were
the
lantern
was
not
lighted
when
he
picked
it
up
i
did
not
see
how
he
lighted
it
it
was
an
ordinary
oil
lantern
apparently
with
a
wire
handle
to
carry
it
by
and
after
he
had
carried
it
for
half
a
minute
it
seemed
to
burn
brightly
of
its
own
accord
i
called
king
attention
to
it
i
seen
that
done
before
he
answered
but
he
did
not
say
whether
or
not
he
understood
the
trick
of
it
ismail
came
running
to
meet
us
the
instant
we
showed
ourselves
but
stopped
when
he
saw
the
mahatma
and
kneeling
laid
the
palms
of
both
hands
on
his
forehead
on
the
stone
flags
that
was
a
strange
thing
for
a
moslem
to
do
especially
toward
a
hindu
but
the
mahatma
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
him
and
walked
straight
past
as
if
he
had
not
been
there
he
could
hear
king
footsteps
and
mine
behind
him
of
course
and
did
not
need
to
look
back
but
there
was
something
almost
comical
in
the
way
he
seemed
to
ignore
our
existence
and
go
striding
along
alone
as
if
on
business
bent
he
acted
as
little
like
a
priest
or
a
fakir
or
a
fanatic
as
any
man
i
have
ever
seen
and
no
curator
or
theater
usher
ever
did
the
honors
of
the
show
with
less
attention
to
his
own
importance
he
led
the
way
through
the
same
bronze
gate
that
we
had
entered
by
and
never
paused
or
glanced
behind
him
until
he
came
to
the
cage
where
the
old
black
panther
snarled
behind
the
bars
and
then
a
remarkable
thing
happened
at
first
the
panther
began
running
backward
and
forward
as
the
caged
brutes
usually
do
when
they
think
they
are
going
to
be
fed
for
all
his
age
he
looked
as
full
of
fight
as
a
newly
caught
young
one
and
his
long
yellow
fangs
flashed
from
under
the
curled
lip
until
the
mahatma
spoke
to
him
he
only
said
one
word
that
i
could
hear
and
i
could
not
catch
what
the
word
was
but
instantly
the
black
brute
slunk
away
to
the
corner
of
its
cage
farthest
from
the
iron
door
and
at
that
the
mahatma
opened
the
door
without
using
any
key
that
i
detected
the
padlock
may
have
been
a
trick
one
but
i
know
this
it
came
away
in
his
hands
the
moment
he
touched
it
then
at
last
he
took
notice
of
king
and
me
again
he
stood
aside
and
smiled
and
motioned
to
us
with
his
hand
to
enter
the
cage
ahead
of
him
i
have
been
several
sorts
of
rash
idiot
in
my
time
and
i
daresay
that
king
has
too
for
most
of
us
have
been
young
once
but
i
have
also
hunted
panthers
and
so
has
king
and
to
walk
unarmed
or
even
with
weapons
into
a
black
panther
cage
is
something
that
calls
i
should
say
for
inexperience
the
more
you
know
about
panthers
the
less
likely
you
are
to
do
it
it
was
almost
you
could
see
the
yellow
eyes
gleaming
but
no
other
part
of
him
now
because
he
matched
the
shadows
perfectly
but
being
a
cat
he
could
see
us
and
the
odds
against
a
man
who
should
walk
into
that
cage
were
as
a
rough
guess
ten
trillion
to
one
fear
is
the
presence
of
death
and
death
is
delusion
follow
me
then
said
the
mahatma
he
walked
straight
in
keeping
the
lighted
lantern
on
the
side
of
him
farthest
from
the
panther
whose
claws
i
could
hear
scratching
on
the
stone
flags
keep
that
light
toward
him
for
god
sake
i
urged
having
myself
had
to
use
a
lantern
more
than
a
score
of
times
for
protection
at
night
against
the
big
cats
nay
it
troubles
his
eyes
for
god
sake
i
will
hide
it
from
him
the
mahatma
answered
we
must
not
wait
here
come
on
said
king
and
strode
in
through
the
open
door
so
i
went
in
too
because
i
did
not
care
to
let
king
see
me
hesitate
curiosity
had
vanished
i
was
simply
in
a
blue
funk
and
rather
angry
as
well
at
the
absurdity
of
what
we
were
doing
the
gray
mahatma
turned
and
shut
the
gate
behind
me
taking
no
notice
at
all
of
the
black
brute
that
crouched
in
the
other
corner
grumbling
and
moaning
rather
than
growling
have
you
ever
seen
a
panther
spit
and
spring
when
a
keeper
shoved
it
out
of
the
way
with
the
cleaning
rake
there
is
no
beast
in
the
world
with
whom
it
is
more
dangerous
to
play
tricks
yet
in
that
dark
corner
with
the
lantern
held
purposely
so
that
it
should
not
dazzle
the
eyes
the
gray
mahatma
stirred
the
beast
with
his
toe
and
drove
him
away
as
carelessly
and
incautiously
as
you
might
shove
your
favorite
dog
aside
the
panther
crowded
itself
against
the
side
of
the
cage
and
slunk
away
behind
us
to
the
front
of
the
cage
that
is
to
say
close
by
the
padlocked
gate
where
he
crouched
again
and
moaned
the
dark
rear
end
of
the
cage
was
all
masonry
and
formed
part
of
the
building
behind
it
in
the
corner
almost
invisible
from
outside
was
a
narrow
door
of
thick
teak
that
opened
very
readily
when
the
mahatma
fumbled
with
it
although
i
saw
no
lock
hasp
or
keyhole
on
the
side
toward
us
we
followed
him
through
into
a
stone
vault
and
now
there
is
need
to
be
careful
he
said
his
voice
booming
and
echoing
along
unseen
corridors
for
though
those
here
who
can
harm
you
if
they
will
are
without
evil
intention
nevertheless
injury
begets
desire
to
injure
and
do
either
of
you
know
how
to
make
acceptable
explanations
to
a
whose
young
have
been
trodden
on
therefore
walk
with
care
observing
the
lantern
light
and
remembering
that
as
long
as
you
injure
none
none
will
injure
you
at
that
he
turned
on
his
heel
abruptly
and
walked
forward
swinging
the
lantern
so
that
its
light
swept
to
and
fro
we
were
walking
through
the
heart
of
masonry
whose
blocks
were
nearly
black
with
age
there
was
a
smell
of
ancient
sepulchers
and
in
places
the
walls
were
damp
enough
to
be
green
and
slippery
presently
we
came
to
the
top
of
a
flight
of
stone
steps
each
step
being
made
of
one
enormous
block
and
worn
smooth
by
the
sandalled
traffic
of
centuries
it
grew
damper
as
we
descended
and
those
great
blocks
were
tricky
things
for
a
man
in
boots
to
walk
on
yet
the
gray
mahatma
swinging
his
lantern
several
steps
below
us
kept
calling
back
have
a
care
have
a
care
he
who
falls
can
do
as
much
injury
as
he
who
jumps
shall
the
injured
inquire
into
reasons
we
descended
forty
or
fifty
steps
and
i
walking
last
had
just
reached
the
bottom
when
something
dashed
between
my
feet
and
another
something
flicked
like
a
after
it
as
the
mahatma
swung
the
lantern
i
just
caught
sight
of
an
enormous
rat
closely
pursued
by
a
snake
and
after
that
we
might
as
well
have
been
in
hell
for
all
the
difference
it
would
have
made
to
me
i
do
know
how
long
that
tunnel
was
but
i
do
know
i
am
not
going
back
there
to
measure
it
it
was
nearly
as
big
as
the
new
york
subway
only
built
of
huge
stone
blocks
instead
of
concrete
it
seemed
to
be
an
inferno
in
which
cobras
hunted
rats
perpetually
but
we
saw
one
swarm
of
rats
eating
a
dead
snake
there
were
baby
cobras
by
the
hundred
savage
things
and
even
smaller
that
knew
as
much
of
evil
and
could
slay
as
surely
as
the
that
raised
her
hood
and
hissed
as
we
passed
the
snakes
seemed
afraid
of
the
mahatma
and
yet
not
afraid
of
him
much
more
careful
to
keep
out
from
under
his
feet
than
ours
yet
taking
no
other
apparent
notice
of
him
whereas
hundreds
of
them
raised
their
hoods
and
hissed
at
us
and
though
nothing
touched
him
at
least
fifty
times
rats
and
snakes
raced
over
king
feet
and
mine
or
slipped
between
our
legs
this
fellow
has
some
use
for
us
king
said
over
his
shoulder
neither
be
killed
himself
nor
let
us
be
if
he
can
help
it
this
is
no
new
trick
lots
of
can
manage
snakes
the
gray
mahatma
twenty
yards
ahead
heard
every
word
of
that
he
stopped
and
let
us
come
quite
close
up
to
him
have
you
seen
this
he
asked
there
was
a
cobra
swinging
its
head
about
two
and
a
half
feet
off
the
ground
within
a
yard
of
him
he
passed
the
lantern
to
me
and
holding
out
both
hands
coaxed
the
venomous
thing
to
come
to
him
as
you
or
i
might
coax
a
stray
dog
it
obeyed
it
laid
its
head
on
his
hands
lowered
its
hood
and
climbed
until
within
six
inches
of
his
face
its
head
rested
on
his
left
shoulder
would
you
like
to
try
that
he
asked
you
can
do
it
if
you
wish
we
did
not
wish
and
while
we
stood
there
the
infernal
reptiles
were
swarming
all
around
us
rising
and
swaying
with
their
forked
tongues
flashing
in
and
out
but
showing
no
inclination
to
use
their
fangs
although
many
of
them
raised
their
hoods
at
that
moment
there
were
certainly
fifty
of
the
filthy
things
close
enough
to
strike
and
the
bite
of
any
one
of
them
would
have
meant
certain
death
within
fifteen
minutes
however
they
did
not
bite
the
gray
mahatma
set
down
very
gently
the
snake
that
had
done
his
bidding
and
then
shooed
the
rest
away
they
backed
off
like
a
flock
of
foolish
geese
hissing
and
swaying
pretty
much
as
geese
do
come
he
boomed
cobras
are
foolish
people
and
folly
is
infectious
come
away
chapter
iv
the
pool
of
terrors
we
came
soon
to
another
flight
of
steps
made
of
gigantic
blocks
of
stone
older
than
history
and
groping
our
way
up
those
we
followed
the
gray
mahatma
to
a
gallery
at
the
top
on
the
other
side
of
which
was
a
sheer
drop
and
the
smell
of
stagnant
water
i
could
hear
something
sluggish
that
moved
in
the
water
and
somewhere
in
the
distance
was
a
turning
around
which
light
found
its
way
so
dimly
that
it
hardly
looked
like
light
at
all
but
more
like
filmy
mist
a
heavy
monster
splashed
somewhere
beneath
us
and
the
mahatma
raised
the
lantern
to
peer
into
our
faces
those
are
alligators
you
may
see
them
now
if
you
would
rather
the
same
as
with
the
snakes
the
rule
is
you
must
do
them
no
harm
he
looked
at
us
keenly
as
if
making
sure
that
we
really
were
not
enjoying
ourselves
and
then
leaned
his
weight
against
an
iron
door
in
a
corner
it
swung
open
and
we
followed
him
through
into
a
chamber
of
some
kind
but
the
door
we
came
in
by
had
hardly
slammed
behind
us
when
a
bright
light
broke
through
a
square
hole
in
the
ceiling
and
displayed
a
flight
of
steps
some
one
overhead
had
removed
a
stone
plug
from
the
hole
the
mahatma
motioned
to
king
to
go
first
but
as
king
refused
he
led
the
way
again
going
through
the
square
hole
overhead
as
handily
as
any
seaman
swinging
himself
into
the
king
followed
him
and
i
stood
on
the
top
step
with
head
and
shoulders
through
the
opening
surveying
the
prospect
before
scrambling
up
after
him
i
was
looking
between
king
legs
the
light
came
from
three
large
placed
over
at
the
left
end
of
a
rectangular
chamber
hewn
out
of
solid
rock
the
chamber
was
at
least
a
hundred
feet
long
and
thirty
wide
its
roof
was
lost
in
smoke
but
seemed
to
be
irregular
as
if
the
walls
of
a
natural
cavern
had
been
shaped
by
masons
who
left
the
high
roof
as
they
found
it
a
very
nearly
naked
man
with
a
long
beard
hair
over
his
shoulders
and
the
general
air
of
being
some
one
in
authority
was
walking
about
with
nothing
in
his
hand
except
a
bamboo
cane
he
was
a
very
old
man
but
of
magnificent
physique
and
ribbed
up
like
a
in
training
his
principal
business
seemed
to
be
the
supervision
of
several
absolutely
naked
individuals
who
carried
in
wood
through
a
dark
gap
in
the
wall
and
piled
it
on
the
three
fires
at
the
farther
end
with
almost
ludicrous
precision
and
between
the
three
fires
not
spitted
and
not
bound
but
absolutely
motionless
there
sat
a
human
being
so
dried
out
that
not
even
that
fierce
heat
could
wring
a
drop
of
sweat
from
him
yet
living
for
you
could
see
him
breathe
and
the
firelight
shone
on
his
living
yet
unwinking
eyes
every
draft
of
air
that
he
drew
into
his
lungs
must
have
scorched
him
every
single
hair
had
disappeared
from
his
body
and
while
we
watched
they
came
and
fed
him
but
he
was
only
one
of
many
all
undergoing
torture
in
its
most
hideous
and
useless
forms
and
all
as
free
as
he
was
to
deliver
themselves
if
they
saw
fit
the
least
offensive
was
a
man
within
six
feet
of
me
who
sat
on
a
conical
stone
no
bigger
than
a
cocoanut
that
small
stone
was
resting
on
top
of
a
cone
of
rock
about
a
yard
high
in
such
fashion
that
it
rocked
at
the
slightest
change
of
balance
the
man
legs
were
crossed
however
exactly
as
if
he
were
squatting
on
the
floor
although
they
actually
rested
on
nothing
and
his
arms
had
been
crossed
behind
his
back
for
so
long
and
held
so
steadily
that
the
fingernails
of
the
right
hand
had
grown
through
the
left
arm
biceps
and
vice
versa
he
too
was
fed
with
drops
of
water
and
about
a
dozen
grains
of
rice
every
second
day
as
the
mahatma
told
us
afterward
space
was
at
a
premium
in
that
gruesome
madhouse
close
beside
the
fellow
on
the
rocking
stone
there
hung
two
ropes
from
rings
in
the
roof
there
were
iron
hooks
on
their
lower
ends
and
these
were
passed
through
the
back
muscles
of
another
naked
man
who
kept
himself
swinging
by
touching
the
floor
with
one
toe
the
muscles
were
so
drawn
by
his
weight
that
they
formed
loops
several
inches
long
and
had
turned
to
dry
gristle
the
strain
had
had
some
effect
on
one
of
his
legs
for
it
was
curled
up
under
him
and
apparently
useless
but
the
other
with
which
he
toed
the
floor
to
swing
himself
was
apparently
all
right
his
hands
were
folded
over
his
breast
and
his
beard
and
hair
hung
like
seaweed
near
him
again
there
was
an
arrangement
like
a
medieval
rack
only
that
instead
of
having
a
wheel
or
a
lever
the
cords
were
drawn
by
heavy
weights
a
man
lay
on
it
with
arms
and
legs
stretched
out
toward
its
corners
so
tightly
that
his
body
did
not
touch
the
underlying
strut
and
he
had
been
so
long
in
that
position
that
his
hands
and
feet
were
dead
from
the
pressure
of
the
cords
and
his
limbs
were
stretched
several
inches
beyond
their
normal
length
in
proof
that
his
torture
too
was
voluntary
he
was
balancing
a
round
stone
on
his
solar
plexus
that
could
have
been
much
more
easily
dumped
than
kept
in
place
the
priest
stared
questioningly
at
the
gray
mahatma
glancing
from
him
to
us
and
back
again
the
gray
mahatma
beckoned
king
and
me
and
led
the
way
between
the
shuddersome
twisted
wrecks
of
humanity
to
an
opening
in
the
far
wall
through
which
we
passed
into
another
chamber
carved
out
of
the
rock
not
so
large
as
the
first
and
only
lighted
by
a
charcoal
brazier
that
gave
off
as
much
fumes
as
flame
the
fitful
bluish
light
fell
in
a
stone
ledge
in
a
niche
like
a
sepulcher
carved
in
one
wall
and
on
that
ledge
a
man
lay
who
had
every
muscle
of
his
body
pierced
with
thorns
his
tongue
protruded
between
his
teeth
and
was
held
there
by
a
thorn
thrust
through
it
the
gray
mahatma
stood
and
looked
at
him
and
smiled
just
a
presumptuous
fool
he
said
pleasantly
this
was
the
most
presumptuous
of
them
all
but
they
all
suffer
for
the
same
offense
take
warning
they
could
walk
away
if
they
cared
to
they
are
here
of
what
they
think
is
their
free
will
they
are
moths
who
sought
the
flame
some
from
curiosity
some
from
desire
some
craving
adoration
for
themselves
all
for
one
false
reason
or
another
this
fate
might
be
yours
so
take
warning
there
is
not
one
of
these
who
was
not
warned
he
said
quietly
they
were
cautioned
not
to
inquire
into
matters
too
deep
for
them
they
were
here
to
be
taught
but
that
little
knowledge
that
is
such
a
dangerous
thing
tempted
them
too
swiftly
forward
beyond
their
depth
so
that
now
you
see
them
they
seek
to
get
rid
of
material
bodies
and
to
satisfy
themselves
that
death
is
a
delusion
you
revolt
at
the
sight
of
these
fools
yet
i
tell
you
that
should
you
commit
the
same
offense
you
would
behave
as
they
even
as
the
moth
that
goes
too
near
the
flame
take
care
lest
curiosity
overwhelm
you
all
right
lead
along
king
answered
rather
testily
i
seen
worse
than
this
a
hundred
times
i
seen
the
women
the
mahatma
nodded
gravely
but
not
even
i
may
lead
you
forward
clothed
as
you
are
he
said
i
am
about
to
reveal
such
mysteries
as
set
presumptuous
fools
to
seeking
perfection
by
a
too
short
route
even
i
would
be
slain
if
i
tried
to
introduce
you
in
that
garb
undress
he
set
us
the
example
but
as
we
were
not
qualified
by
years
of
arduously
won
sanctity
to
stand
stark
naked
in
the
presence
he
conceded
us
a
clout
apiece
torn
from
a
filthy
length
of
calico
that
some
one
had
tossed
in
a
corner
and
he
tore
another
piece
of
filthy
red
cotton
cloth
in
halves
and
divided
it
between
us
to
twist
around
our
heads
king
laughed
at
me
you
look
like
a
fine
fat
bengali
he
said
the
mahatma
called
to
one
of
the
servitors
to
bring
ashes
in
a
brass
bowl
we
watched
him
rake
them
out
from
under
the
fires
shake
water
on
them
and
mix
them
into
paste
as
casually
as
if
the
business
were
part
of
his
regular
routine
the
mahatma
took
the
bowl
from
him
and
plastered
king
and
me
liberally
with
the
stuff
making
king
look
like
a
scabrous
fanatic
and
i
do
doubt
i
looked
worse
having
more
acreage
of
anatomy
last
of
all
he
put
some
on
himself
but
only
here
and
there
as
if
his
sanctity
only
demanded
a
little
piercing
out
then
he
raised
a
flagstone
in
one
corner
of
the
chamber
that
swung
easily
on
pivots
set
in
sockets
in
the
masonry
and
led
the
way
again
we
were
evidently
in
a
system
of
caves
that
had
been
quarried
into
shape
centuries
before
the
christian
era
they
seemed
originally
to
have
been
bubbles
and
in
volcanic
rock
and
to
have
been
connected
together
by
piercing
the
walls
between
them
there
was
certainly
no
intelligible
plan
attached
to
their
arrangement
for
we
went
first
up
then
down
then
sideways
losing
all
sense
of
elevation
and
direction
but
we
passed
through
at
least
three
score
of
those
connected
and
the
air
in
some
of
the
higher
ones
was
so
foul
that
breathing
it
made
you
weak
at
the
knees
nevertheless
in
every
single
one
there
was
an
anchorite
of
some
kind
engaged
in
painful
meditation
in
each
cave
was
an
infinitesimal
lamp
made
of
baked
clay
and
fed
with
vegetable
oil
that
provided
more
smoke
than
flame
and
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
deep
with
the
soot
of
centuries
following
the
gray
mahatma
example
king
and
i
took
handfuls
of
the
soot
and
smeared
it
on
our
breasts
stomachs
and
faces
to
mingle
with
the
ashes
in
a
mask
of
holiness
by
the
time
we
had
finished
that
there
was
not
much
chance
of
any
one
mistaking
us
for
anything
but
two
aspirants
for
sanctity
i
could
not
possibly
have
drawn
a
tracing
of
our
own
course
for
it
was
rank
bewildering
but
we
emerged
at
last
under
the
stars
by
the
side
of
a
great
stone
tank
it
might
have
been
a
bathing
pool
for
along
each
side
steps
disappeared
into
the
water
we
could
dimly
distinguish
one
end
on
our
right
hand
with
a
row
of
great
graven
gods
all
reflected
in
the
water
but
the
other
end
vanished
through
a
black
it
was
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
feet
wide
from
bank
to
bank
and
between
us
and
the
steps
that
faced
us
on
the
far
side
in
among
the
quivering
i
could
count
the
snouts
of
eighteen
alligators
which
way
now
king
asked
him
a
shade
suspiciously
forward
he
answered
with
a
note
of
surprise
but
if
the
mahatma
supposed
that
a
coat
of
soot
and
ashes
provided
either
king
or
me
with
a
satisfactory
reason
for
hobnobbing
with
alligators
in
their
home
pool
he
was
emphatically
mistaken
we
objected
simultaneously
unanimously
and
right
out
loud
in
meeting
suit
yourself
said
i
this
suits
me
here
go
forward
if
you
like
said
king
we
wait
for
you
the
gray
mahatma
turned
and
eyed
us
solemnly
but
not
unkindly
if
i
should
leave
you
here
he
said
a
much
worse
fate
would
overtake
you
than
any
that
you
anticipate
for
your
minds
are
not
advanced
enough
to
imagine
the
horrors
that
assail
all
those
who
lack
courage
this
is
the
testing
place
for
aspirants
and
more
win
their
way
across
it
than
you
might
suppose
impudence
of
ambition
adding
skill
to
recklessness
all
must
make
the
attempt
alone
and
at
night
who
seek
the
inner
shrines
of
knowledge
and
those
creatures
in
the
tank
have
no
other
food
than
is
thus
provided
those
whose
courage
failed
them
are
now
such
fakirs
as
we
have
seen
who
now
seek
to
rid
themselves
of
materiality
which
is
the
cause
of
fear
by
ridding
themselves
of
their
fleshy
envelope
follow
me
then
he
stepped
down
into
the
water
and
at
once
it
became
evident
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes
there
were
two
tanks
the
division
between
them
lying
about
eighteen
inches
under
water
but
the
division
was
neither
straight
nor
exactly
level
it
this
and
that
way
like
the
in
a
maze
and
was
more
beset
with
slippery
pitfalls
than
a
at
low
tide
king
followed
the
mahatma
in
and
i
came
last
so
i
had
the
benefit
of
two
pilots
as
well
as
the
important
task
of
holding
king
whenever
he
groped
his
way
forward
with
one
foot
for
the
mahatma
went
a
great
deal
faster
than
we
cared
to
follow
so
that
although
he
had
shown
us
the
way
we
were
still
doubtful
of
our
footing
at
intervals
he
would
pause
and
turn
and
look
at
us
and
every
time
he
did
that
those
long
loathsome
snouts
would
ripple
toward
him
like
spokes
of
a
wheel
but
he
took
no
more
notice
of
them
than
if
they
had
been
they
seemed
more
interested
in
him
than
in
us
there
were
seven
sharp
turns
in
that
underwater
causeway
and
the
edges
of
each
turn
were
slippery
slopes
up
which
an
alligator
certainly
could
climb
but
that
afforded
not
the
least
chance
to
a
man
whose
foot
once
stepped
too
far
and
slid
and
not
only
were
there
unexpected
turns
at
different
intervals
but
there
were
gaps
in
the
causeway
of
a
yard
or
so
in
at
least
a
dozen
places
and
the
edges
of
those
gaps
were
smooth
and
rounded
as
if
purposely
designed
to
dump
all
wayfarers
into
the
very
jaws
of
the
waiting
reptiles
it
was
in
just
such
places
as
that
that
they
began
to
gather
and
wait
patiently
with
their
awful
yellow
eyes
just
noticeable
in
the
starlight
king
and
i
were
standing
on
one
such
rounded
the
mahatma
twenty
yards
away
was
taking
his
time
about
turning
to
give
us
directions
and
one
great
fifteen
foot
brute
had
raised
itself
on
the
causeway
behind
us
and
was
snapping
its
paws
together
like
a
pair
of
vicious
castanets
nero
and
caligula
were
christian
gentlemen
compared
to
you
i
called
out
to
the
mahatma
you
are
fortunate
he
boomed
back
you
have
starlight
and
a
guide
those
who
are
not
chosen
have
to
find
their
way
or
fail
alone
under
a
cloudy
sky
there
is
none
to
hold
while
they
grope
there
is
none
to
care
whether
they
succeed
or
not
save
only
the
that
desires
a
meal
nevertheless
there
are
some
of
them
who
succeed
so
how
should
you
fail
take
a
step
to
the
left
now
a
long
one
each
holding
the
other
then
another
to
the
left
then
to
the
right
again
curse
you
i
shouted
back
staring
over
king
shoulder
there
a
head
between
us
and
the
next
nay
he
answered
that
the
i
could
have
sworn
that
he
was
lying
but
king
set
his
foot
on
it
and
in
a
moment
more
we
were
working
our
way
cautiously
along
the
causeway
again
making
for
the
next
sharp
corner
where
the
mahatma
had
been
standing
to
give
us
the
direction
but
he
never
waited
for
us
to
catch
up
with
him
i
think
he
suspected
that
in
panic
we
might
clutch
him
and
offer
violence
and
he
always
moved
on
as
we
approached
leaving
us
to
grope
our
way
in
agonies
of
apprehension
the
going
did
not
become
easier
as
we
progressed
when
the
gray
mahatma
reached
the
steps
on
the
far
side
and
stood
out
of
the
water
waiting
for
us
all
the
monsters
that
had
watched
his
progress
came
and
joined
our
party
and
now
instead
of
keeping
to
the
water
two
of
them
climbed
up
on
the
causeway
so
that
there
was
one
of
the
creatures
behind
us
and
two
in
front
call
off
your
cousins
and
your
uncles
and
your
aunts
i
shouted
bearing
in
mind
the
hindu
creed
that
consigns
the
souls
of
unrighteous
men
to
the
bodies
of
animals
in
retribution
for
their
sins
the
gray
mahatma
picked
up
a
short
pole
from
the
embankment
and
returned
into
the
water
with
it
not
striking
out
right
and
left
as
any
person
would
have
done
but
shoving
the
brutes
away
gently
one
by
one
as
if
they
were
logs
or
small
boats
and
even
so
they
followed
us
so
closely
that
they
climbed
the
steps
abreast
of
us
but
i
willing
to
bet
that
there
is
not
an
alligator
living
that
can
catch
me
once
my
feet
are
set
on
hard
ground
and
i
can
say
the
same
for
king
we
danced
up
those
steps
together
like
a
pair
of
fauns
emerging
from
a
forest
pool
then
the
gray
mahatma
came
and
peered
into
our
faces
and
asked
an
extraordinary
question
do
you
feel
proud
he
asked
looking
keenly
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
because
he
went
on
to
explain
you
have
now
crossed
the
pool
of
terrors
and
they
are
not
so
many
who
accomplish
that
the
are
well
fed
and
those
who
reach
to
this
side
are
usually
proud
believing
they
now
have
the
secret
key
to
the
attainment
of
all
knowledge
you
are
going
to
see
now
what
becomes
of
the
proud
ones
the
mahatma
led
us
forward
toward
a
long
dark
shadow
that
transformed
itself
into
a
temple
wall
as
we
drew
closer
and
in
a
moment
we
were
once
more
groping
our
way
downward
amid
prehistoric
foundation
stones
with
bats
flitting
past
us
and
a
horrible
feeling
possessing
me
at
least
that
the
worst
was
yet
to
come
the
hunch
proved
accurate
we
came
into
an
enormous
crypt
that
evidently
underlay
a
temple
great
pillars
of
natural
rock
practically
square
and
twenty
feet
thick
supported
the
roof
which
was
partly
of
natural
rock
and
partly
of
jointed
masonry
there
was
nothing
in
the
crypt
itself
except
one
old
who
sat
on
a
mat
by
a
candle
reading
a
roll
of
manuscript
and
he
did
not
trouble
to
look
up
did
not
take
the
slightest
notice
of
us
but
around
the
crypt
there
were
more
cells
than
i
could
count
some
were
dark
there
were
lights
burning
in
the
others
each
had
an
iron
door
with
a
few
holes
in
it
and
a
small
square
window
unglazed
and
unbarred
cut
in
the
natural
rock
enough
light
came
through
some
of
those
square
holes
to
suffuse
the
whole
crypt
dimly
none
but
an
aspirant
has
ever
entered
here
said
the
gray
mahatma
even
when
india
was
conquered
no
enemy
penetrated
this
place
you
stand
on
forbidden
ground
he
turned
to
the
left
and
opened
an
iron
cell
door
by
simply
pushing
it
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
lock
he
did
not
announce
himself
but
walked
straight
in
and
we
followed
him
the
cell
was
about
ten
feet
by
twelve
with
a
stone
ledge
wide
enough
to
sleep
on
running
along
one
side
and
lighted
by
an
oil
lamp
that
hung
by
chains
from
the
hewn
roof
there
were
three
bearded
men
almost
naked
squatting
on
one
mat
facing
the
stone
ledge
one
of
whom
held
an
ancient
manuscript
that
all
three
were
consulting
and
on
the
stone
ledge
sat
what
once
had
been
a
man
before
those
devils
caught
him
the
three
looked
up
at
the
gray
mahatma
curiously
but
did
not
challenge
i
suppose
his
nakedness
was
his
passport
they
eyed
king
and
me
with
a
appraisal
nodded
and
resumed
their
consultation
of
the
roll
the
characters
on
it
looked
like
sanskrit
the
gray
mahatma
faced
the
creature
on
the
stone
ledge
and
spoke
to
king
and
me
in
english
that
he
said
is
one
of
those
who
crossed
the
pool
of
terrors
and
became
insane
with
pride
consider
him
he
entered
here
demanding
knowledge
having
only
the
desire
and
not
the
honesty
but
since
there
is
no
way
backward
and
even
failure
must
subserve
the
universal
cause
he
was
given
knowledge
and
it
made
him
what
you
see
now
these
who
know
a
little
and
would
learn
more
make
use
of
him
as
a
subject
for
experiments
that
thing
who
was
once
a
man
can
imagine
himself
a
bird
or
a
fish
or
an
animal
or
even
an
insensate
graven
stone
at
their
command
when
he
is
no
more
fit
to
be
studied
he
will
imagine
himself
to
be
a
and
will
hurry
into
the
tank
with
the
other
reptiles
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
him
come
i
felt
like
going
mad
that
minute
i
sat
down
on
the
rock
floor
and
held
my
head
to
make
sure
that
i
still
had
it
i
wanted
to
think
of
something
that
would
give
me
back
my
grip
on
sanity
and
the
good
clean
concrete
world
outside
i
do
think
i
could
have
done
it
if
king
had
not
seen
and
applied
the
solution
he
kicked
me
in
the
ribs
as
hard
as
he
could
with
his
naked
foot
and
that
failing
used
his
fist
get
up
he
said
hit
me
if
you
want
to
then
he
turned
to
the
mahatma
confound
you
take
us
out
of
this
peace
peace
said
the
gray
mahatma
you
are
chosen
you
are
needed
for
another
purpose
no
harm
shall
come
to
either
of
you
there
is
one
more
cell
that
you
must
enter
no
said
i
and
i
met
his
eye
squarely
i
seen
my
fill
of
these
sights
lead
the
way
out
he
did
not
appear
in
the
least
afraid
of
me
merely
curious
as
if
he
were
viewing
an
experiment
i
made
up
my
mind
on
the
instant
to
experiment
on
my
own
account
and
swung
my
fist
back
for
a
smash
at
him
i
let
go
too
but
the
blow
fell
on
king
who
stepped
between
us
and
knocked
nearly
all
the
wind
out
of
him
none
o
that
he
gasped
let
see
this
through
the
gray
mahatma
patted
him
gently
on
the
shoulder
good
he
said
very
good
you
did
well
chapter
v
far
cities
the
gray
mahatma
led
the
way
toward
one
of
the
great
square
pillars
that
supported
a
portion
of
the
roof
in
that
pillar
there
was
an
opening
about
six
feet
high
and
barely
wide
enough
for
a
man
of
my
build
to
squeeze
himself
through
but
once
inside
it
there
was
ample
space
and
a
stairway
hewn
in
the
stone
wound
upward
still
swinging
the
lantern
he
had
brought
with
him
from
yasmini
palace
the
mahatma
led
the
way
up
that
and
we
followed
i
last
as
usual
we
emerged
through
a
wooden
door
into
a
temple
whose
walls
were
almost
entirely
hidden
by
enormous
images
of
india
gods
there
were
no
windows
the
resulting
gloom
was
punctuated
by
dots
of
yellow
light
that
came
from
hanging
brass
lamps
whose
smoke
in
the
course
of
centuries
had
covered
everything
with
soot
that
it
was
nobody
business
to
remove
so
it
looked
like
a
pantheon
and
in
the
darkness
you
could
hardly
see
the
forms
of
men
who
were
mumbling
through
some
sort
of
ceremony
those
said
the
gray
mahatma
are
priests
they
receive
payment
to
pray
for
people
who
may
not
enter
lest
their
sinfulness
defile
the
sanctuary
there
was
only
one
consideration
that
prevented
me
from
looking
for
a
door
behind
a
carved
stone
screen
placed
at
the
end
wall
screen
and
bidding
the
mahatma
a
discourteous
farewell
and
that
was
the
prospect
of
walking
through
the
streets
with
nothing
on
but
a
and
a
small
red
turban
however
the
gray
mahatma
as
naked
as
the
day
he
was
born
led
the
way
to
the
screen
opened
a
hinged
door
in
it
and
beckoned
us
through
and
we
emerged
instead
of
into
the
street
as
i
expected
into
a
marvelous
courtyard
bathed
in
moonlight
for
the
moon
was
just
appearing
over
the
roof
of
what
looked
like
another
temple
at
the
rear
all
around
the
courtyard
was
a
portico
supported
by
pillars
of
most
wonderful
workmanship
and
the
four
walls
within
the
portico
were
subdivided
into
open
compartments
in
each
of
which
was
the
image
of
a
different
god
in
front
of
each
image
hung
a
lighted
lamp
whose
rays
were
reflected
in
the
idol
jeweled
eyes
but
the
only
people
visible
were
three
or
four
sleepy
looking
attendants
in
turbans
and
cotton
who
sat
up
and
stared
at
us
without
making
any
other
sign
of
recognition
in
the
very
center
of
the
courtyard
was
a
big
square
platform
built
of
stone
with
a
roof
like
a
canopy
supported
on
carved
pillars
similar
to
those
that
supported
the
portico
which
is
to
say
that
each
one
was
different
and
yet
all
were
so
alike
as
to
blend
into
architectural
harmony
repetition
without
monotony
the
gray
mahatma
led
the
way
up
steps
on
to
the
platform
and
waited
for
us
at
a
square
opening
in
the
midst
of
its
floor
beside
which
lay
a
stone
that
obviously
fitted
the
hole
exactly
there
were
no
rings
to
lift
the
stone
by
from
the
outside
but
there
were
holes
drilled
through
it
from
side
to
side
through
which
iron
bolts
could
be
passed
from
underneath
down
that
hole
we
went
in
single
file
again
the
gray
mahatma
leading
treading
an
oval
stairway
interminably
until
i
daresay
we
had
descended
more
than
a
hundred
feet
the
air
was
warm
but
breathable
and
there
seemed
to
be
plenty
of
it
as
if
some
efficient
means
of
artificial
ventilation
had
been
provided
nevertheless
it
was
nothing
else
than
a
cavern
that
we
were
exploring
and
though
there
were
traces
of
chisel
and
adze
work
on
the
walls
the
only
masonry
was
the
steps
we
came
to
the
bottom
at
last
in
an
cave
in
the
center
of
which
stood
a
rock
roughly
hewn
and
on
that
rock
exactly
in
the
middle
was
a
lingam
of
black
polished
marble
illuminated
by
a
brass
lamp
hanging
overhead
the
mahatma
eyed
it
curiously
that
he
said
is
the
last
symbol
of
ignorance
the
remainder
is
knowledge
there
were
doors
on
every
side
of
that
cave
each
set
cunningly
into
a
natural
fold
of
rock
so
that
they
seemed
to
have
been
inset
when
it
was
molten
in
the
way
that
nuts
are
set
into
chocolate
pushed
into
place
by
a
pair
of
titanic
thumbs
and
at
last
we
seemed
to
have
reached
a
place
where
the
gray
mahatma
might
not
enter
uninvited
for
he
selected
one
of
the
doors
after
a
moment
thought
and
knocked
we
stood
there
for
possibly
ten
minutes
without
an
answer
the
mahatma
seeming
satisfied
with
his
own
meditation
and
we
not
caring
to
talk
lest
he
should
overhear
us
at
last
the
door
opened
not
cautiously
but
suddenly
and
wide
and
a
man
stood
square
in
it
who
filled
it
up
from
frame
to
frame
a
muscular
individual
in
and
turban
who
looked
too
proud
to
assert
his
pride
he
stood
with
arms
folded
and
a
smile
on
his
firm
mouth
and
the
impression
he
conveyed
was
that
of
a
whose
skill
was
his
life
and
whose
craft
was
all
he
cared
about
he
eyed
the
mahatma
without
respect
or
flinching
and
said
nothing
have
you
ever
watched
two
wild
animals
meet
stand
looking
at
each
other
and
suddenly
go
off
together
without
a
sign
of
an
explanation
that
was
what
happened
the
man
in
the
doorway
presently
turned
his
back
and
led
the
way
in
the
passage
we
entered
was
just
exactly
wide
enough
for
me
to
pass
along
with
elbows
touching
either
wall
it
was
high
there
was
plenty
of
air
in
it
it
was
as
scrupulously
clean
as
a
hospital
ward
on
either
hand
there
were
narrow
wooden
doors
spaced
about
twenty
feet
apart
every
one
of
them
closed
there
were
no
bolts
on
the
outside
of
the
doors
and
no
keyholes
but
i
could
not
move
them
by
shoving
against
them
as
i
passed
the
extraordinary
circumstance
was
the
light
the
whole
passage
was
bathed
in
light
yet
i
could
not
detect
where
it
came
from
it
was
not
dazzling
like
electricity
no
one
place
seemed
brighter
than
another
and
there
were
no
shadows
the
end
of
the
passage
forked
at
a
perfect
right
angle
and
there
were
doors
at
the
end
of
each
arm
of
the
fork
our
guide
turned
to
the
right
he
king
and
the
mahatma
passed
through
a
door
that
seemed
to
open
at
the
slightest
touch
and
the
instant
the
mahatma
back
had
passed
the
i
found
myself
in
darkness
i
had
hung
back
a
little
trying
to
make
shadows
with
my
hands
to
discover
the
direction
of
the
light
and
the
strange
part
was
that
i
could
see
bright
light
in
front
of
me
through
the
open
door
but
none
of
it
came
out
into
the
passage
it
was
intuition
that
caused
me
to
pause
at
the
threshold
before
following
the
others
through
something
about
the
suddenness
with
which
the
light
had
ceased
in
the
passage
the
moment
the
mahatma
back
was
past
the
door
added
to
curiosity
made
me
stop
and
consider
that
plane
where
the
light
left
off
having
no
other
instrument
available
i
took
off
my
turban
and
flapped
it
to
and
fro
to
see
whether
i
could
produce
any
effect
on
that
astonishing
dividing
line
and
for
about
the
ten
thousandth
time
in
a
somewhat
strenuous
career
it
was
intuition
and
curiosity
that
saved
me
the
instant
the
end
of
the
turban
touched
the
plane
between
light
and
darkness
it
caught
fire
or
rather
i
should
say
fire
caught
it
and
the
fire
was
so
intense
and
swift
that
it
burned
off
that
part
of
the
turban
without
damaging
the
rest
in
other
words
there
was
a
plane
of
unimaginably
active
heat
between
me
and
the
rest
of
the
party
of
such
extraordinary
heat
that
it
functioned
only
on
that
plane
for
i
could
not
feel
it
with
my
hand
from
an
inch
away
and
i
being
in
pitch
darkness
while
they
were
in
golden
light
the
others
could
not
see
me
they
could
hear
however
and
i
called
to
king
i
told
him
what
happened
and
then
showed
him
by
throwing
what
was
left
of
the
turban
toward
him
it
got
exactly
as
far
as
the
plane
between
light
and
darkness
and
then
vanished
in
a
silent
flash
so
swiftly
and
completely
as
to
leave
no
visible
charred
fragment
i
could
see
all
three
men
standing
in
line
facing
in
my
direction
hardly
ten
feet
away
and
it
was
difficult
to
remember
that
they
could
not
see
me
at
all
or
at
any
rate
that
king
could
not
the
others
may
have
had
some
trained
sixth
sense
that
made
it
possible
come
forward
said
the
gray
mahatma
we
three
came
by
why
should
it
harm
you
king
sized
up
the
situation
instantly
if
they
intended
to
kill
me
and
keep
him
alive
that
would
not
be
with
his
permission
or
connivance
and
he
stepped
forward
suddenly
toward
me
stop
commanded
the
mahatma
showing
the
first
trace
of
excitement
that
he
had
yet
betrayed
but
king
kept
on
and
i
suppose
that
the
man
who
was
acting
showman
did
something
because
king
crossed
the
line
without
anything
happening
and
then
stood
with
one
foot
on
each
side
of
the
threshold
while
i
crossed
there
are
two
of
us
in
this
he
said
to
the
gray
mahatma
then
you
ca
kill
one
and
take
the
other
we
were
in
a
chamber
roughly
fifty
feet
square
whose
irregular
corners
were
proof
enough
that
it
had
been
originally
another
of
those
huge
in
volcanic
stone
the
roof
too
had
been
left
rough
but
the
greater
part
of
the
had
been
finished
off
smooth
with
the
chisel
and
there
was
a
big
rectangular
rock
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
shaped
like
a
table
or
an
altar
and
polished
until
it
shone
i
decided
to
sit
down
on
it
whereat
the
mahatma
ceased
to
ignore
me
fool
he
barked
keep
off
that
i
tore
a
piece
off
the
rag
i
was
wearing
for
a
and
tossed
it
on
the
polished
surface
of
the
stone
it
vanished
instantly
and
left
no
trace
it
did
not
even
leave
a
mark
on
the
stone
and
the
burning
was
so
swift
and
complete
that
there
was
no
smell
thanks
i
said
but
why
your
sudden
anxiety
on
my
account
he
turned
to
king
again
you
have
seen
the
that
shows
in
darkness
the
scenery
near
at
hand
provided
the
sun
is
shining
the
is
a
feeble
imitation
of
the
true
idea
there
are
no
limits
to
the
vision
of
him
who
understands
true
science
what
city
do
you
wish
to
see
benares
king
answered
suddenly
we
were
in
darkness
equally
suddenly
the
whole
top
surface
of
the
stone
table
became
bathed
in
light
of
a
different
quality
light
like
daylight
that
perhaps
came
upward
from
the
stone
but
if
so
came
only
a
little
way
to
me
it
looked
much
more
as
if
it
began
suddenly
in
and
descended
toward
the
surface
of
the
stone
and
there
all
at
once
as
clearly
as
if
we
saw
it
on
the
focusing
screen
of
a
gigantic
camera
lay
benares
spread
before
us
with
all
its
color
its
sacred
cattle
in
the
streets
its
crowds
bathing
in
the
ganges
temples
domes
trees
movement
almost
the
smell
of
benares
was
there
for
the
suggestion
was
but
why
is
it
daylight
in
benares
while
it
somewhere
near
midnight
here
king
demanded
that
instant
the
sunshine
in
benares
ceased
and
the
moon
and
stars
came
out
the
glow
of
lamps
shone
forth
from
the
temple
courtyards
and
down
by
the
river
ghats
were
the
lurid
crimson
flame
and
smoke
where
they
cremated
dead
hindus
it
was
far
more
perfect
than
a
motion
picture
allowing
for
scale
it
looked
actually
real
suddenly
the
chamber
was
all
suffused
in
golden
light
once
more
and
the
picture
on
the
granite
table
vanished
name
another
city
said
the
gray
mahatma
london
king
answered
the
light
went
out
and
there
sure
enough
was
london
first
the
strand
crowded
with
then
ludgate
hill
and
paul
then
the
royal
exchange
and
bank
of
england
then
london
bridge
and
the
tower
bridge
and
a
panorama
of
the
thames
are
you
satisfied
the
gray
mahatma
asked
and
once
again
the
cavern
was
flooded
with
that
peculiarly
restful
golden
light
while
the
picture
on
the
granite
table
disappeared
not
a
bit
king
answered
it
a
trick
of
some
sort
is
wireless
telegraphy
a
trick
then
retorted
the
mahatma
if
so
then
yes
so
this
is
only
this
is
as
far
in
advance
of
wireless
telegraphy
as
telegraphy
is
in
advance
of
the
semaphore
this
is
a
science
beyond
your
knowledge
that
is
all
name
another
city
timbuctu
i
said
suddenly
and
nothing
happened
mombasa
i
said
then
and
mombasa
appeared
instantly
with
kilindini
harbor
fringed
with
i
had
been
to
mombasa
whereas
i
never
had
seen
timbuctu
almost
certainly
none
present
had
ever
seen
the
place
or
even
a
picture
of
it
the
gray
mahatma
said
something
in
a
surly
undertone
and
the
golden
light
turned
itself
on
again
flooding
the
whole
chamber
king
nodded
to
me
you
can
speak
into
a
phonograph
and
reproduce
your
voice
there
no
reason
why
you
ca
think
and
reproduce
that
too
if
you
know
how
he
said
aye
the
mahatma
interrupted
if
you
know
how
india
has
always
known
how
india
can
teach
these
sciences
to
all
the
world
when
she
comes
into
her
freedom
throughout
the
man
who
had
admitted
us
had
not
spoken
one
word
he
stood
with
arms
folded
as
upright
as
a
soldier
on
parade
but
now
he
unfolded
his
arms
and
began
to
exhibit
signs
of
restlessness
as
if
he
considered
that
the
session
had
lasted
long
enough
however
he
was
still
silent
your
honor
is
extremely
clever
i
enjoyed
the
exhibition
i
said
to
him
in
hindustanee
but
he
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
me
and
if
he
understood
he
did
not
betray
the
fact
let
us
go
said
the
gray
mahatma
and
proceeded
to
lead
the
way
the
gray
mahatma
took
the
other
turning
of
the
passage
and
knocked
on
the
door
at
the
end
it
was
opened
by
a
little
man
who
once
had
been
extremely
fat
for
his
skin
hung
about
him
in
loose
folds
his
cavern
was
smaller
than
the
other
but
as
clean
and
similarly
flooded
with
the
restful
golden
light
but
he
was
only
host
the
gray
mahatma
was
showman
he
said
all
energy
is
vibrations
yet
that
is
only
one
fraction
of
the
truth
all
is
vibration
the
universe
consists
of
nothing
else
your
western
scientists
are
just
beginning
to
discover
that
but
they
are
men
groping
in
the
dark
who
can
feel
but
not
see
and
understand
throughout
what
all
nations
have
agreed
to
call
the
dark
ages
there
have
been
men
called
alchemists
whom
other
men
have
mocked
because
they
sought
to
transmute
baser
metals
into
gold
do
you
think
they
sought
what
was
impossible
nothing
is
impossible
they
dimly
discerned
the
possibility
and
it
may
be
that
their
ears
had
caught
the
legend
of
what
has
been
known
in
india
for
countless
ages
gold
is
a
system
of
vibrations
just
as
every
other
metal
is
and
the
one
can
be
changed
into
the
other
but
if
you
knew
how
to
do
it
would
you
dare
can
you
conceive
what
would
happen
to
the
world
if
it
were
common
knowledge
or
even
if
it
were
known
to
a
few
how
the
transmutation
may
be
brought
about
now
watch
what
followed
was
convincing
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
was
nothing
covered
up
and
no
complicated
apparatus
that
might
cause
you
to
suspect
an
ordinary
conjuring
trick
there
were
certainly
strange
looking
boxes
with
hinged
lids
arranged
on
a
ledge
along
one
side
of
the
chamber
but
those
were
only
brought
into
play
when
the
funny
little
man
selected
a
lump
of
metal
from
them
on
another
ledge
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
cell
there
were
about
a
hundred
rolls
of
very
manuscripts
but
he
did
not
make
use
of
them
in
any
way
the
floor
was
bare
smooth
rock
there
was
nothing
on
it
not
even
a
mat
he
laid
a
plain
piece
of
wood
on
the
floor
and
motioned
us
to
be
seated
in
front
of
it
so
we
squatted
in
a
line
with
our
backs
to
the
door
king
taking
his
place
between
the
mahatma
and
me
there
was
no
or
flummery
the
whole
proceeding
was
as
simple
as
playing
dominoes
our
host
went
to
one
of
the
peculiar
looking
boxes
and
selected
a
lump
of
what
looked
like
lead
it
was
a
small
piece
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
loaf
of
sugar
and
had
no
particular
marks
on
it
except
that
it
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
cut
from
a
larger
piece
with
shears
or
some
such
instrument
he
dropped
in
into
the
middle
of
the
slab
of
wood
and
squatted
in
front
of
it
facing
us
to
watch
i
daresay
it
took
twenty
minutes
for
that
lump
of
lead
to
change
into
what
looked
like
gold
before
our
eyes
it
began
by
sizzling
and
melting
in
little
pits
and
spots
but
never
once
did
the
whole
lump
melt
the
tiny
portions
that
melted
and
liquefied
became
full
of
motion
although
the
motion
was
never
in
one
place
for
more
than
about
a
minute
at
a
time
and
wherever
the
motion
had
been
the
lump
lost
bulk
so
that
gradually
the
whole
piece
shrank
and
shrank
at
the
end
it
was
not
in
its
original
shape
but
had
taken
the
form
of
a
miniature
dropping
i
suppose
it
was
hot
our
host
waited
several
minutes
before
picking
it
off
the
slab
at
last
he
took
the
nugget
off
the
slab
and
tossed
it
to
king
king
handed
it
to
me
it
was
still
warm
and
it
looked
and
felt
like
gold
i
laid
it
back
on
the
slab
do
you
understand
it
asked
the
gray
mahatma
chapter
vi
the
fire
bathers
our
little
host
did
the
honors
as
far
as
the
door
and
i
thanked
him
for
the
demonstration
but
the
gray
mahatma
seemed
displeased
with
that
and
ignoring
me
as
usual
turned
on
king
in
the
doorway
almost
savagely
do
you
understand
that
whoever
can
do
what
you
have
just
seen
can
also
accomplish
the
reverse
of
it
and
transmute
gold
into
baser
metal
he
demanded
does
it
occur
to
you
what
that
would
mean
a
new
species
of
warfare
one
combination
of
ambitious
fools
making
gold
another
unmaking
it
chaos
now
you
shall
see
another
science
that
is
no
fit
pabulum
for
fools
we
came
to
a
door
on
our
right
it
was
opened
instantly
by
a
lean
ascetic
whose
hooked
nose
suggested
an
infernal
brand
of
contempt
for
whoever
might
not
agree
with
him
just
as
the
others
had
done
he
met
the
gray
mahatma
eyes
in
silence
and
admitted
us
by
simply
turning
his
back
but
this
door
only
opened
into
another
passage
and
we
had
to
follow
him
for
fifty
feet
and
then
through
another
door
into
a
cavern
that
was
bigger
than
any
and
this
time
our
host
was
not
alone
we
were
expected
by
a
dozen
lean
bronze
men
who
squatted
in
a
row
on
one
mat
with
expressionless
faces
they
were
not
wearing
masks
but
they
looked
as
if
they
might
have
been
this
last
cavern
was
certainly
a
its
round
roof
blackened
with
smoke
was
like
the
underside
of
a
cathedral
dome
no
effort
seemed
to
have
been
made
to
trim
the
walls
and
the
floor
too
had
been
left
as
nature
made
it
shaped
something
like
a
hollow
dish
by
the
pressure
of
expanding
gases
millions
of
years
ago
when
the
rock
was
molten
the
very
center
of
the
vast
floor
was
the
lowest
point
of
all
and
some
work
had
been
done
there
for
it
was
shaped
into
a
rectangular
trough
thirty
feet
long
by
ten
wide
that
trough
there
was
no
guessing
how
deep
it
might
be
was
filled
almost
to
the
brim
with
charcoal
so
that
obviously
there
was
a
means
of
forcing
a
draft
into
it
from
underneath
now
said
the
mahatma
turning
to
king
as
usual
and
ignoring
me
your
friend
may
submit
to
the
test
if
he
wishes
he
may
walk
on
that
furnace
he
shall
walk
unscathed
i
promise
it
king
turned
to
me
what
say
he
asked
i
seen
this
done
before
it
can
be
done
shall
we
try
it
together
footnote
see
the
newspaper
accounts
of
in
the
presence
of
the
prince
of
wales
and
about
a
thousand
witnesses
mostly
european
i
did
not
hesitate
there
are
times
when
even
such
a
slow
thinker
as
i
am
can
make
up
his
mind
in
a
flash
i
said
no
with
such
emphasis
that
king
laughed
the
mahatma
looked
at
me
rather
pityingly
but
made
no
comment
he
invited
the
two
of
us
to
sit
down
so
we
squatted
on
the
floor
as
close
to
the
trough
as
we
could
go
without
being
scorched
there
were
no
screens
or
obstructions
of
any
kind
and
the
only
appliance
in
evidence
was
an
iron
paddle
which
the
man
who
had
admitted
us
picked
up
off
the
floor
he
took
that
paddle
and
without
any
preliminary
fuss
or
hesitation
walked
straight
on
to
the
bed
of
charcoal
beginning
at
one
end
and
smoothed
the
whole
glowing
surface
with
the
paddle
taking
his
time
about
it
and
working
with
as
little
excitement
as
a
gardener
using
a
rake
when
he
had
finished
the
end
of
the
paddle
was
better
than
a
good
the
hairs
on
his
legs
were
unscorched
the
cotton
cloth
of
which
his
kilt
was
made
showed
not
the
slightest
trace
of
burning
as
soon
as
he
had
sat
down
the
other
twelve
advanced
toward
the
fire
unlike
him
they
were
stark
naked
one
by
one
they
walked
into
the
fire
and
traversed
it
from
end
to
end
with
no
more
sign
of
nervousness
than
if
they
had
been
utterly
unconscious
of
its
existence
then
they
turned
around
and
walked
back
again
is
it
the
men
or
the
fire
king
demanded
neither
the
mahatma
answered
it
is
simply
knowledge
any
one
can
do
it
who
knows
how
one
of
the
men
approached
the
fire
again
he
sat
down
on
it
and
went
through
the
motions
of
bathing
himself
in
the
flame
turning
his
head
repeatedly
to
grin
at
us
then
lying
down
he
rolled
from
end
to
end
of
the
furnace
and
walked
away
at
last
as
casually
as
if
he
had
come
out
of
a
bath
it
was
perfectly
astonishing
stuff
to
watch
if
this
is
superstition
or
mesmerism
or
deception
of
some
kind
why
do
you
insist
on
all
this
mummery
of
soot
and
ashes
for
my
friend
and
me
king
demanded
why
do
you
use
a
temple
full
of
hindu
idols
to
conceal
your
science
if
it
is
a
natural
science
and
not
trickery
the
gray
mahatma
smiled
tolerantly
can
you
suggest
a
better
way
of
keeping
the
secret
he
answered
we
are
protected
by
the
superstition
not
even
the
government
of
india
would
dare
arouse
the
superstitious
wrath
of
a
people
by
inquiring
too
closely
into
what
goes
on
beneath
a
temple
if
we
were
to
admit
that
what
we
know
is
science
just
as
wireless
telegraphy
is
a
science
we
would
not
be
safe
for
an
hour
the
military
the
kings
of
commerce
the
merely
curious
and
all
the
enemies
of
mankind
would
invent
ten
thousand
excuses
of
investigating
us
where
did
you
learn
english
king
demanded
i
am
a
of
johns
hopkins
the
gray
mahatma
answered
i
have
traveled
all
over
the
united
states
seeking
for
one
man
who
might
be
trusted
with
the
rudiments
of
our
science
but
i
found
none
suppose
you
had
found
the
wrong
man
and
trusted
him
king
suggested
my
friend
said
the
gray
mahatma
you
are
better
known
to
us
than
we
to
you
you
are
a
man
incapable
of
treachery
you
love
india
and
all
your
life
you
have
striven
to
act
always
and
in
all
things
like
a
man
you
have
been
watched
for
years
your
character
has
been
studied
if
our
purpose
had
been
to
conquer
the
world
or
to
destroy
the
world
we
would
never
have
selected
you
there
is
no
need
to
speak
to
you
of
what
would
happen
if
you
should
commit
treachery
there
is
no
risk
of
your
explaining
the
secret
of
our
science
to
the
wrong
individual
for
you
are
not
going
to
be
taught
it
well
what
of
my
friend
ramsden
king
asked
him
your
friend
ramsden
i
think
will
never
again
see
the
united
states
why
he
has
seen
too
much
for
his
own
good
he
lacks
your
mentality
he
has
bravery
of
a
kind
and
honesty
of
a
kind
but
he
is
not
the
right
man
for
our
purpose
he
made
a
mistake
when
he
came
with
you
king
looked
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
gray
mahatma
you
think
you
know
me
he
asked
i
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
that
possible
said
king
do
you
suppose
i
would
tell
you
the
truth
i
know
it
i
am
sure
of
it
you
have
too
much
integrity
to
deal
in
lies
very
well
king
answered
quietly
it
both
of
us
or
neither
either
we
both
go
free
or
you
do
your
worst
to
us
both
this
man
is
my
friend
the
gray
mahatma
smiled
and
thought
and
smiled
and
looked
at
king
and
then
away
again
it
would
be
a
pity
to
destroy
yourself
he
said
at
last
nevertheless
you
are
the
only
chance
your
friend
has
i
have
no
enmity
against
him
he
is
merely
unsuitable
he
will
be
the
victim
of
his
own
shortcomings
unless
you
can
rescue
him
but
if
you
make
the
attempt
and
fail
i
am
afraid
my
friend
that
that
will
be
the
end
of
both
of
you
it
was
rather
like
listening
to
your
own
autopsy
i
confess
that
i
began
again
to
feel
horribly
afraid
although
not
so
much
so
that
i
cared
to
force
king
into
danger
on
my
account
and
once
more
i
made
my
mind
up
swiftly
i
reached
out
to
seize
the
gray
mahatma
by
the
throat
but
king
struck
my
hand
up
we
two
to
their
many
he
said
sternly
keep
your
hair
on
the
mahatma
smiled
and
nodded
a
second
time
you
have
done
well
he
exclaimed
if
you
can
keep
the
buffalo
from
blundering
but
we
waste
time
come
king
put
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
we
out
of
the
cavern
behind
the
mahatma
looking
i
do
doubt
supremely
ridiculous
and
i
for
one
feeling
furiously
helpless
we
entered
another
cave
whose
dome
looked
like
an
absolutely
perfect
hemisphere
but
the
whole
place
was
so
full
of
noise
that
your
brain
reeled
in
confusion
there
were
ten
men
in
there
naked
to
the
waist
as
all
the
rest
had
been
and
every
single
one
of
them
had
the
intelligent
look
of
an
alert
bird
with
its
head
to
one
side
they
were
sitting
on
mats
on
the
floor
in
no
apparent
order
and
each
man
had
a
row
of
tuning
forks
in
front
of
him
pretty
much
like
any
other
tuning
forks
except
that
there
were
eight
of
them
to
each
note
and
its
subdivisions
every
few
minutes
one
of
them
would
select
a
fork
strike
it
and
listen
then
he
would
get
up
dragging
his
mat
after
him
with
all
the
forks
arranged
on
it
and
sit
down
somewhere
else
but
the
tuning
forks
were
not
the
cause
of
the
din
it
was
the
roar
of
a
great
city
that
was
echoing
under
the
dome
clatter
of
traffic
and
men
voices
whistling
of
the
wind
through
overhead
wires
dogs
barking
an
occasional
bell
at
intervals
the
whistle
of
a
locomotive
and
the
rumble
and
bump
of
a
railroad
train
whirring
of
dynamoes
the
clash
and
thump
of
trolley
cars
cries
and
the
sound
of
breaking
on
the
shore
you
hear
bombay
said
the
mahatma
then
we
all
sat
down
in
line
it
was
actual
physical
torture
until
you
were
used
to
it
and
i
doubt
whether
you
could
get
used
to
it
without
somebody
to
educate
you
some
scientist
to
show
you
how
to
defend
your
nerves
against
that
outrageous
racket
for
the
sounds
were
all
out
of
adjustment
and
proportion
nothing
was
in
key
it
was
as
if
the
laws
of
acoustics
had
been
lifted
and
sound
had
gone
crazy
at
one
moment
apropos
of
nothing
and
disconnected
from
all
other
sounds
you
could
hear
a
man
or
a
woman
speaking
as
distinctly
as
if
the
individual
were
up
there
under
the
dome
then
a
chaos
of
notes
would
swallow
the
voice
and
the
next
might
be
a
dog
bark
or
a
locomotive
whistle
the
only
continuously
recognizable
sounds
were
a
power
station
and
the
thunder
of
waves
along
the
harbor
front
and
it
sounded
much
more
thunderous
than
it
should
have
done
at
that
season
of
the
year
the
tuning
of
an
orchestra
does
not
nearly
approximate
the
confusion
for
the
members
of
the
orchestra
are
all
trying
to
find
one
pitch
and
are
gradually
hitting
it
whereas
every
sound
within
that
cavern
seemed
to
be
pitched
and
keyed
differently
this
is
our
latest
said
the
mahatma
it
is
only
for
two
or
three
hundred
years
that
we
have
been
studying
this
phenomenon
it
may
possibly
take
us
two
or
three
hundred
years
more
before
we
can
control
it
i
wanted
to
ask
questions
but
could
not
because
the
cursed
inharmony
made
my
senses
reel
nevertheless
you
could
hear
other
sounds
perfectly
when
i
struck
my
hand
on
the
rock
floor
i
could
hear
the
slap
at
least
as
distinctly
as
normal
possibly
a
little
more
so
and
when
the
gray
mahatma
spoke
each
word
was
separate
and
sharp
now
you
shall
hear
another
city
he
said
observe
that
the
voices
of
cities
are
as
various
as
men
no
two
are
alike
sound
and
color
are
one
and
the
same
thing
differently
expressed
and
the
graduations
of
both
are
infinite
he
caught
the
eye
of
one
of
the
men
calcutta
he
said
in
a
voice
not
exactly
of
command
yet
certainly
not
of
deference
without
acknowledging
the
order
in
any
other
way
the
man
got
on
his
knees
and
picked
up
an
enormous
tuning
fork
whose
prongs
were
about
three
feet
long
and
he
made
some
adjustment
in
the
fork
of
it
that
took
about
five
minutes
he
might
have
been
turning
the
screw
of
a
micrometer
i
could
not
see
then
raising
the
fork
above
his
shoulder
he
struck
the
floor
with
it
and
a
as
clear
as
the
peal
of
a
bell
went
ringing
up
into
the
dome
the
effect
was
almost
ridiculous
it
made
you
want
to
laugh
everybody
in
the
cavern
smiled
and
i
daresay
if
the
truth
were
known
we
had
discovered
the
of
comedy
that
one
note
chased
all
the
others
out
of
the
dome
as
a
dog
might
chase
sheep
as
the
wind
blows
clouds
away
as
a
cop
drives
small
boys
off
the
grass
they
actually
scampered
out
of
hearing
and
you
could
imagine
them
hiding
close
by
either
they
were
gone
for
good
and
that
one
clear
the
middle
f
went
vibrating
around
and
around
as
if
scouring
out
the
very
smell
of
what
had
been
there
that
is
the
of
all
nature
said
the
mahatma
all
sounds
all
colors
all
thoughts
all
vibrations
center
in
that
note
it
is
the
key
that
can
unlock
them
all
the
silence
that
followed
when
the
last
ringing
overtone
had
gone
off
galloping
in
its
stride
toward
infinity
was
the
most
absolute
and
awful
silence
i
have
ever
had
to
listen
to
the
very
possibility
of
sound
seemed
to
have
ceased
to
exist
you
could
not
believe
that
there
could
be
sound
nor
remember
what
sound
was
like
a
whole
sense
and
its
functions
had
been
taken
from
you
and
the
resultant
void
was
dead
so
dead
that
no
sense
could
live
in
it
unless
fear
is
a
sense
you
could
feel
horribly
afraid
and
i
tell
you
what
the
fear
amounted
to
there
was
a
feeling
that
these
men
were
fooling
with
the
force
that
runs
the
universe
and
that
the
next
stroke
might
be
a
mistake
that
would
result
like
the
touching
of
two
wires
multiplied
to
the
you
could
not
resist
the
suggestion
that
the
world
might
burst
in
fragments
at
any
minute
meanwhile
the
fellow
with
the
tuning
fork
fiddled
again
with
some
adjustment
on
the
thick
portion
of
its
stem
and
presently
whirling
it
around
his
head
as
the
warriors
used
swords
he
brought
it
down
on
one
of
a
circle
of
small
anvils
that
were
arranged
around
him
like
the
figures
on
a
you
could
almost
see
calcutta
instantly
the
miracle
was
the
reverse
of
the
preceding
one
the
ringing
subdivided
sharp
discordant
note
he
struck
was
swallowed
instantly
in
a
sea
of
noise
that
seemed
not
only
to
have
color
but
even
smell
to
it
you
could
smell
calcutta
but
that
of
course
was
mere
suggestion
a
trick
of
the
senses
of
the
sort
that
makes
your
mouth
water
when
you
see
another
fellow
suck
a
lemon
you
could
even
hear
the
crows
that
sit
on
the
trees
in
the
park
and
caw
at
you
could
hear
the
organ
in
a
christian
church
and
the
snarl
of
a
pious
moslem
reading
from
the
koran
there
was
the
click
of
ponies
hoofs
the
whirring
and
honk
of
the
sucking
of
hoogli
river
booming
of
a
roars
of
trains
and
the
peculiar
clamor
of
calcutta
swarms
that
i
can
never
hear
without
thinking
of
a
cobra
with
its
hood
just
ready
to
raise
in
the
sea
of
noises
in
the
dome
one
instantly
stood
out
the
voice
of
a
man
speaking
english
with
a
slightly
babu
accent
for
exactly
as
long
as
the
reverberations
of
those
two
tuning
forks
lasted
you
could
hear
him
declaiming
and
then
his
voice
faded
away
into
the
ocean
of
noise
like
a
rock
that
has
shown
for
a
moment
above
the
surface
of
a
maelstrom
that
is
a
member
of
the
legislature
where
ignorant
men
in
session
make
laws
for
fools
to
break
said
the
gray
mahatma
signing
to
king
and
me
to
remain
seated
he
himself
crossed
the
floor
to
where
the
sat
and
squatting
down
beside
him
began
picking
up
tuning
forks
and
striking
one
against
the
other
each
time
he
did
that
some
city
sound
or
other
distinguished
itself
for
a
moment
exactly
as
the
theme
appears
in
music
only
some
of
the
vibrations
seemed
to
jar
against
others
instead
of
blending
with
them
and
when
that
happened
the
effect
was
intensely
disagreeable
at
last
he
struck
a
combination
that
made
me
jump
as
effectually
as
sudden
some
of
the
other
sounds
had
affected
king
more
but
that
particular
one
passed
him
by
and
tortured
me
watching
with
his
head
a
little
to
one
side
the
gray
mahatma
instantly
began
striking
those
two
forks
as
rapidly
as
if
he
were
clapping
hands
increasing
the
vehemence
with
each
stroke
if
i
had
stayed
there
i
would
have
been
stark
mad
or
dead
within
five
minutes
i
felt
as
if
i
were
being
vibrated
asunder
as
if
my
whole
body
were
resolving
into
its
component
parts
i
lay
on
the
floor
with
my
head
in
both
hands
and
i
daresay
yelled
with
agony
but
i
do
know
about
that
at
any
rate
king
understood
and
acted
instantly
he
seized
me
under
the
arms
and
dragged
me
to
the
door
where
he
had
to
drop
me
in
order
to
find
how
to
open
the
thing
having
accomplished
that
he
dragged
me
through
into
the
passage
where
the
agony
ceased
as
instantly
as
the
ache
does
when
a
dentist
pulls
an
abscessed
tooth
no
one
sound
reached
us
through
the
open
door
however
immature
that
particular
branch
of
their
science
might
be
they
had
learned
the
way
of
absolutely
localizing
noise
the
gray
mahatma
came
out
smiling
and
ignoring
me
as
if
i
was
not
there
he
opened
another
door
not
requiring
to
knock
this
time
and
led
the
way
along
another
passage
that
wound
through
solid
rock
for
what
can
hardly
have
been
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
king
had
dragged
me
out
of
that
dome
of
dins
in
the
nick
of
time
and
my
head
was
recovering
rapidly
by
the
time
we
reached
a
door
at
the
end
of
that
long
passage
i
could
think
clearly
and
although
too
weak
to
stand
upright
without
holding
on
to
something
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
know
that
the
remainder
would
be
only
a
matter
of
minutes
and
we
spent
three
or
four
of
the
minutes
waiting
for
the
door
to
open
which
it
did
at
last
suddenly
a
man
appeared
in
the
opening
whose
absolutely
white
hair
reached
below
his
and
whose
equally
white
beard
descended
to
his
middle
he
wore
the
usual
but
was
usual
in
nothing
else
he
looked
older
than
methuselah
yet
strong
for
his
muscles
stood
out
like
knotted
and
active
for
he
stood
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
with
the
immobility
that
only
comes
of
ableness
the
most
unusual
thing
of
all
was
that
he
spoke
he
said
several
words
in
sanskrit
to
the
gray
mahatma
before
turning
his
back
on
us
and
leading
the
way
in
chapter
vii
magic
we
went
into
a
cavern
whose
floor
was
nearly
all
the
way
around
the
rim
of
the
cup
was
an
irregular
ledge
averaging
twenty
feet
in
width
with
that
exception
the
whole
interior
was
shaped
like
an
enormous
egg
with
its
narrow
end
upward
the
bottom
was
nowhere
less
than
a
hundred
feet
across
and
was
reached
by
steps
cut
irregularly
downward
from
the
rim
at
intervals
around
the
ledge
were
seated
about
a
score
of
men
some
solitary
some
in
groups
of
three
some
were
naked
others
wore
all
were
silent
but
they
all
took
an
obvious
interest
in
us
and
some
of
them
were
grinning
a
few
of
them
squatted
with
their
legs
tucked
under
them
but
most
of
them
let
their
legs
hang
over
the
edge
and
they
all
had
an
air
of
perfect
familiarity
with
the
surroundings
as
well
as
what
can
be
best
described
as
a
team
look
you
see
the
same
air
of
careless
competence
around
a
circus
lot
king
and
i
followed
the
gray
mahatma
down
into
the
bowl
and
under
his
directions
seated
ourselves
exactly
in
the
middle
king
and
i
back
to
back
and
the
mahatma
a
little
way
from
us
and
also
with
his
back
turned
in
that
position
my
back
was
toward
the
door
we
had
entered
by
but
i
was
able
to
see
nine
narrow
openings
in
the
opposite
wall
about
twenty
feet
higher
than
the
ledge
and
those
openings
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
what
followed
although
i
ca
prove
it
old
who
had
admitted
us
stood
on
the
ledge
like
a
picture
of
simon
stylites
folding
his
arms
under
his
flowing
beard
and
looking
almost
ready
to
plunge
downward
as
if
the
bowl
were
a
swimming
tank
however
he
suddenly
filled
his
great
scrawny
breast
with
air
and
boomed
out
one
word
the
golden
light
ceased
to
exist
there
was
no
period
of
going
as
there
is
even
with
electric
light
he
spoke
and
it
was
not
nothing
whatever
was
visible
i
held
a
finger
up
and
poked
my
eye
before
i
knew
it
then
all
at
once
there
began
the
most
delicious
music
like
ariel
singing
in
it
was
subdued
but
as
clear
as
the
ripple
of
a
mountain
stream
over
pebbles
and
there
was
absolutely
no
locating
it
for
it
seemed
to
come
from
everywhere
at
once
even
from
underneath
us
and
simultaneously
with
the
music
there
began
to
be
a
dim
light
which
was
all
the
more
impossible
to
locate
because
it
was
never
the
same
color
in
two
places
nor
even
in
one
place
for
longer
than
a
note
of
music
lasted
observe
boomed
the
gray
mahatma
solemn
voice
color
and
sound
are
one
both
are
vibration
you
shall
behold
the
color
harmonies
presently
the
connection
between
sound
and
color
began
to
be
obvious
each
note
had
its
color
and
as
that
note
was
sounded
the
color
appeared
in
a
thousand
places
it
was
eastern
music
it
filled
the
cavern
and
as
the
pulse
of
it
quickened
the
light
danced
colors
shooting
this
and
that
way
like
shuttles
weaving
a
new
sky
but
there
were
no
yet
and
the
general
effect
was
rather
of
dreaminess
when
the
old
voice
boomed
out
at
last
from
the
ledge
above
us
and
light
and
music
ceased
simultaneously
the
effect
was
nauseating
it
went
to
the
pit
of
your
stomach
the
instantaneous
darkness
produced
vertigo
you
felt
as
if
you
were
falling
down
an
endless
pit
and
king
and
i
clutched
each
other
the
mere
fact
that
we
were
squatting
on
a
hard
floor
did
not
help
matters
for
the
floor
seemed
to
be
falling
too
and
to
be
turning
around
bewilderingly
just
as
the
whorls
of
colored
light
had
done
the
voice
boomed
again
whereat
there
was
more
music
and
light
in
tune
to
it
this
time
of
all
unexpected
things
beethoven
overture
to
leonore
began
to
take
visible
form
in
the
night
and
i
would
rather
be
able
to
set
down
what
we
saw
than
write
homer
iliad
it
must
be
that
we
knew
then
all
that
beethoven
did
it
was
not
just
wind
music
or
mere
strings
but
a
whole
orchestra
where
or
whence
there
was
no
guessing
the
music
came
at
you
from
everywhere
at
once
and
with
it
light
interpreting
the
music
to
me
that
has
always
been
the
most
wonderful
overture
in
the
world
anyhow
for
it
seems
to
describe
creation
when
the
worlds
took
form
in
the
void
but
with
that
light
each
tone
and
and
chord
and
harmony
expressed
in
the
absolutely
pure
color
that
belonged
to
it
it
was
utterly
beyond
the
scope
of
words
it
was
a
new
unearthly
language
more
like
a
glimpse
of
the
next
world
than
anything
in
this
the
combination
of
color
and
music
was
having
a
highly
desirable
effect
on
me
nothing
could
have
done
more
to
counteract
the
effects
of
the
godless
din
that
bowled
me
over
in
the
other
cavern
but
king
was
having
a
rotten
time
he
was
heaving
now
as
he
tried
to
master
himself
i
heard
him
exclaiming
oh
my
god
as
if
the
physical
torture
were
unbearable
the
gray
mahatma
was
not
troubling
about
king
he
had
shifted
his
position
so
as
to
watch
me
and
he
seemed
to
expect
me
to
collapse
so
i
showed
as
little
as
possible
of
my
real
feelings
and
shut
my
eyes
at
intervals
as
if
bewildered
then
he
cried
out
just
as
the
on
the
ledge
had
done
the
overture
to
leonore
ceased
the
colors
gave
place
to
the
restful
golden
light
king
had
not
collapsed
yet
and
his
usual
spartan
prevented
him
then
from
betraying
much
in
the
way
of
symptoms
so
i
clutched
my
head
and
tried
to
look
which
gave
me
a
chance
to
whisper
to
king
under
my
arm
can
you
hang
on
dunno
how
are
you
doing
fine
the
gray
mahatma
seemed
to
think
that
i
was
appealing
to
king
for
help
he
looked
delighted
between
my
fingers
i
could
see
him
signaling
to
the
on
the
ledge
the
golden
light
vanished
again
and
now
once
more
they
gave
us
eastern
music
awful
stuff
pulsating
with
a
distant
drumbeat
like
the
tramp
of
an
army
of
devils
the
colors
were
angry
and
glowering
now
the
shapes
they
took
as
they
plaited
and
wove
themselves
into
one
another
were
all
involuted
everything
turning
itself
inside
out
and
the
end
of
every
separate
movement
was
king
groaned
aloud
and
rolled
over
on
his
side
just
as
the
stuff
became
so
dim
and
dreadful
that
you
could
hardly
see
your
hand
before
your
face
and
a
noise
like
the
rushing
of
the
wind
between
the
worlds
made
every
inch
of
your
skin
prickly
with
low
though
the
colors
were
when
you
shut
your
eyes
you
could
still
see
them
but
i
could
not
see
the
gray
mahatma
and
i
was
sure
he
could
not
see
me
he
would
not
know
which
of
us
was
down
and
out
so
i
seized
king
and
dragged
him
across
the
floor
to
the
point
where
the
irregular
stone
steps
provided
the
only
way
of
escape
there
i
hove
him
like
a
sack
on
to
my
shoulders
in
that
drunken
throbbing
twilight
it
would
have
been
easy
for
some
of
the
crew
to
lean
from
the
ledge
and
send
me
reeling
back
again
the
best
chance
was
to
climb
quickly
before
they
were
aware
of
me
when
i
reached
the
ledge
it
was
deserted
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
indicate
where
the
and
his
crew
were
i
could
not
remember
exactly
the
direction
of
the
entrance
but
made
for
the
wall
intending
to
feel
my
way
along
it
and
just
as
i
started
to
do
that
i
heard
the
gray
mahatma
climbing
up
behind
me
he
made
hardly
more
noise
than
a
cat
but
though
the
mahatma
was
stealthy
he
came
swiftly
and
in
a
moment
i
felt
his
hand
touch
me
that
was
exactly
at
the
moment
when
the
music
and
colors
were
subdued
to
a
sort
of
twilight
the
kind
of
glow
you
might
expect
before
the
overwhelming
of
the
world
you
are
as
strong
as
the
buffalo
himself
he
said
mistaking
me
for
king
leave
that
fool
here
and
come
with
me
my
right
hand
was
free
but
the
gray
mahatma
had
plenty
of
assistance
at
his
beck
and
call
so
i
put
my
hand
in
the
small
of
his
back
and
shoved
him
along
in
front
of
me
if
he
should
learn
too
soon
that
king
and
not
i
was
down
and
out
he
might
decide
to
have
done
with
us
both
there
and
then
my
task
was
to
get
out
of
that
cavern
before
the
golden
light
came
on
again
the
gray
mahatma
led
the
way
to
the
door
and
it
was
just
as
well
that
he
did
for
there
was
some
secret
way
of
opening
it
that
i
should
almost
certainly
have
failed
to
find
i
pushed
him
through
ahead
of
me
and
then
we
were
in
pitch
darkness
there
was
neither
light
nor
room
to
turn
and
nothing
for
it
but
for
the
mahatma
to
lead
the
way
along
and
i
had
to
be
careful
in
carrying
king
not
to
injure
him
against
the
rock
in
the
places
where
the
passage
narrowed
however
he
began
to
recover
gradually
as
we
neared
the
end
of
the
long
passage
regaining
consciousness
by
fits
and
starts
like
a
man
coming
out
of
anesthesia
and
commencing
to
kick
so
that
i
had
hard
work
to
preserve
him
from
injury
when
his
feet
were
not
striking
out
against
the
walls
his
head
was
and
i
finally
shook
him
violently
that
had
the
desired
effect
it
was
just
as
if
fumes
had
gone
out
of
his
head
his
body
grew
warmer
almost
in
a
moment
and
i
felt
him
break
out
into
a
sweat
then
he
groaned
and
asked
me
where
we
were
and
a
moment
later
he
seemed
to
understand
what
was
happening
for
he
struggled
to
free
himself
all
right
he
whispered
let
me
walk
so
i
let
him
slip
down
to
his
feet
in
front
of
me
and
holding
him
beneath
the
armpits
repeated
our
trick
with
positions
reversed
and
when
we
reached
the
outer
door
that
gave
on
to
the
narrow
main
passage
he
was
going
fairly
strong
the
mahatma
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
light
but
it
was
the
strange
peculiarity
of
that
light
that
it
did
not
flow
beyond
its
appointed
boundaries
and
we
continued
to
be
in
darkness
as
long
as
we
did
not
follow
him
through
the
door
so
when
king
stepped
out
ahead
of
me
the
mahatma
had
no
means
of
knowing
what
a
mistake
he
had
been
making
all
along
he
naturally
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
king
had
been
carrying
me
when
i
stepped
out
of
the
pitch
blackness
he
looked
more
than
a
little
surprised
at
my
appearance
and
i
grinned
back
at
him
as
sheepishly
as
i
could
manage
hoping
he
would
not
see
the
red
patch
on
my
shoulder
caused
by
the
pressure
of
king
weight
or
the
scratches
made
by
fingernails
when
he
was
beginning
to
recover
consciousness
nevertheless
he
did
see
and
understood
lead
on
macduff
i
said
in
plain
english
and
perhaps
he
did
not
dislike
me
so
immensely
after
all
for
he
smiled
as
he
turned
his
back
to
lead
the
way
we
passed
without
meeting
anybody
out
through
the
narrow
door
where
the
first
tall
speechless
showman
had
admitted
us
into
the
cave
where
the
lingam
reposed
on
its
stone
altar
and
there
the
mahatma
resumed
the
lantern
he
had
left
when
we
climbed
the
oval
stairway
and
emerged
on
the
platform
under
the
cupola
the
dawn
was
just
about
to
break
the
gray
mahatma
raised
the
stone
lid
with
an
ease
that
betrayed
unsuspected
strength
and
dropped
it
into
place
where
it
fitted
so
exactly
that
no
one
ignorant
of
the
secret
would
ever
have
guessed
the
existence
of
a
hidden
stairway
swinging
his
lantern
the
mahatma
led
into
the
temple
where
the
enormous
idols
loomed
in
quivering
shadow
and
made
straight
for
the
biggest
one
of
all
the
one
that
faced
the
marble
screen
i
thought
he
was
going
to
bow
down
and
worship
it
he
actually
did
go
down
on
hands
and
knees
and
i
turned
to
king
in
amazement
thus
missing
my
chance
to
see
what
he
was
really
up
to
so
i
do
know
how
he
managed
it
but
suddenly
the
whole
lower
part
of
the
idol
including
the
thighs
swung
outward
and
disclosed
a
dark
passage
into
which
he
led
us
and
the
stone
swung
back
into
place
at
our
backs
as
if
balanced
by
weights
at
the
far
end
the
mahatma
led
into
a
tunnel
darker
if
that
were
possible
than
the
vaulted
gloom
we
had
left
and
as
we
entered
in
single
file
i
thought
i
heard
the
splashing
of
water
underneath
about
a
minute
after
that
the
mahatma
stopped
and
let
king
draw
abreast
then
continuing
to
swing
the
lantern
he
started
forward
again
i
know
whether
it
was
fear
intuition
or
just
curiosity
that
made
me
wonder
why
he
should
change
the
formation
in
that
way
but
quite
absurdly
i
deduced
that
he
wished
king
to
walk
into
a
trap
it
was
that
that
saved
me
look
out
king
i
warned
exactly
as
i
spoke
i
set
my
foot
on
a
yielding
stone
felt
a
blast
of
cool
air
and
heard
water
unmistakably
the
air
brought
a
stagnant
smell
with
it
i
slid
forward
and
downward
but
sprang
simultaneously
managing
to
get
my
fingers
on
the
edge
of
the
stone
in
front
but
the
balanced
resuming
its
equilibrium
caught
me
on
the
back
of
the
head
me
and
in
another
second
i
would
have
gone
down
into
the
dark
among
the
alligators
i
just
had
enough
consciousness
left
to
realize
that
i
was
hanging
over
the
covered
end
of
the
alligator
tank
but
the
faint
outer
circle
of
light
cast
by
the
mahatma
lantern
just
reached
me
and
as
king
turned
his
head
to
acknowledge
my
warning
he
saw
me
fall
he
sprang
back
and
seized
my
wrists
just
as
my
fingers
began
slipping
on
the
smooth
stone
but
my
weight
was
almost
too
much
for
him
and
i
came
so
near
to
dragging
him
through
after
me
that
the
stone
trap
got
past
my
head
and
jammed
against
my
elbows
then
i
heard
king
yelling
for
the
mahatma
to
bring
the
lantern
back
and
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
interval
the
mahatma
came
and
set
one
foot
on
the
stone
so
that
it
swung
past
my
head
again
nearly
braining
me
in
its
descent
i
do
know
whether
he
intended
that
or
not
there
is
more
in
this
than
accident
he
said
his
voice
booming
hollow
as
he
bent
to
let
the
light
fall
on
me
very
well
pull
up
your
buffalo
and
you
shall
have
him
it
was
no
easy
task
for
the
two
of
them
to
haul
me
up
because
the
moment
the
mahatma
removed
his
foot
from
the
lid
of
the
trap
the
thing
swung
upward
and
acted
like
the
tongue
of
a
buckle
to
keep
me
from
coming
through
when
he
set
his
foot
on
it
again
the
other
foot
did
not
give
him
sufficient
purchase
finally
king
managed
to
pull
his
off
and
pass
it
around
under
my
armpits
after
which
the
two
together
hauled
me
clear
minus
in
the
aggregate
about
a
half
square
foot
of
skin
that
i
left
on
the
edge
of
the
stone
off
the
mahatma
went
alone
again
swinging
his
lantern
and
apparently
at
peace
with
himself
and
the
whole
universe
thereafter
king
and
i
walked
thinking
in
that
way
to
lessen
the
risk
of
further
pitfalls
but
there
was
no
more
the
mahatma
reached
at
last
what
looked
like
a
blind
stone
wall
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
but
there
was
a
flagstone
missing
from
the
floor
in
front
of
it
and
he
disappeared
down
a
flight
of
steps
we
followed
him
into
a
cellar
whose
walls
wept
moisture
but
we
saw
no
cobras
and
then
up
another
flight
of
steps
on
the
far
side
into
a
chamber
that
i
thought
i
recognized
he
disappeared
through
a
door
in
the
corner
of
that
and
by
the
time
we
had
groped
our
way
after
him
he
was
sitting
in
the
old
black
panther
cage
with
the
brute
head
in
his
lap
stroking
and
twisting
its
ears
as
if
it
were
a
kitten
the
cage
door
was
wide
open
and
the
day
was
already
growing
hot
and
brassy
in
the
east
king
and
i
hurried
out
of
the
cage
for
the
panther
showed
his
fangs
at
us
the
mahatma
followed
us
out
and
snapped
the
door
shut
instantly
the
panther
sprang
at
us
trying
to
bend
the
bars
together
failing
in
that
he
lay
close
and
shoved
his
whole
shoulder
through
clawing
at
us
it
was
hardly
any
wonder
that
that
secret
yet
so
simply
discoverable
door
between
yasmini
palace
and
the
was
unknown
we
swung
along
through
the
great
bronze
gate
and
into
the
courtyard
where
the
shrubs
all
stood
reflected
along
with
the
marble
stairway
in
a
square
pool
we
plunged
right
in
without
as
much
as
hesitating
on
the
brink
dragging
the
mahatma
with
us
not
that
he
made
the
least
objection
he
laughed
and
seemed
to
regard
it
as
thoroughly
good
fun
we
splashed
and
fooled
for
a
few
minutes
standing
and
kicking
at
an
occasional
fish
as
it
darted
by
stirring
up
mud
with
our
toes
until
the
water
was
so
cloudy
that
we
could
see
the
fish
no
longer
then
king
thought
of
clothes
he
stood
on
tiptoe
and
shouted
ismail
o
ismail
ismail
came
like
a
wolf
bowed
to
the
mahatma
as
if
nakedness
and
royalty
were
one
and
stood
eyeing
the
water
curiously
get
us
garments
king
ordered
testily
i
was
not
staring
at
thee
little
king
he
answered
i
was
marveling
but
he
went
off
without
explaining
what
he
had
been
marveling
at
and
we
went
on
with
our
ablutions
the
job
of
getting
ashes
out
of
your
hair
not
being
quite
so
easy
as
it
might
appear
i
daresay
it
was
fifteen
minutes
before
ismail
came
back
carrying
two
complete
native
costumes
for
king
and
me
and
a
long
saffron
robe
for
the
mahatma
then
we
came
out
of
the
water
and
the
gray
mahatma
smiled
i
said
there
were
no
more
traps
and
it
seems
i
spoke
the
truth
he
said
wonderingly
moreover
i
did
not
set
this
trap
but
it
was
you
yourselves
who
led
me
into
it
which
trap
we
demanded
with
one
voice
you
have
stirred
the
mud
my
friends
to
a
condition
in
which
the
who
lives
in
that
pool
is
not
visible
but
the
is
there
and
i
do
know
why
he
did
not
seize
one
of
you
in
the
center
of
the
pool
there
was
a
rockery
for
the
benefit
of
and
breeding
fish
i
walked
around
it
to
look
and
there
sure
enough
lay
a
brute
about
twenty
feet
long
snoozing
with
his
chin
on
a
corner
of
the
rock
i
picked
up
a
pole
to
prod
him
and
he
snapped
and
broke
it
coming
close
to
the
edge
to
clatter
his
jaws
at
me
prodding
him
a
last
time
i
turned
round
to
look
for
the
mahatma
he
had
vanished
gone
as
utterly
and
silently
as
a
myth
king
had
not
seen
him
go
we
inquired
of
ismail
he
laughed
there
is
only
one
place
to
go
here
he
answered
to
the
princess
there
is
nowhere
else
who
shall
disobey
her
i
have
orders
to
unloose
the
panther
if
the
take
any
other
way
than
straight
into
her
presence
chapter
viii
the
river
of
death
dressed
now
in
the
punjabi
costume
with
gorgeous
silk
turbans
we
walked
side
by
side
up
the
marble
steps
and
knocked
on
the
teak
front
door
at
the
top
exactly
as
when
we
arrived
on
the
previous
day
the
door
was
immediately
opened
by
two
women
the
mahatma
was
in
there
ahead
of
us
and
had
evidently
told
yasmini
sufficient
of
our
adventures
to
make
her
laugh
she
squealed
with
delight
at
sight
of
us
come
sit
beside
me
in
the
window
both
of
you
my
women
will
bring
food
afterward
you
shall
sleep
poor
things
you
look
as
if
you
need
it
o
what
is
that
blood
on
your
linen
were
you
hurt
her
swift
restless
fingers
drew
the
cloth
aside
and
showed
a
few
inches
of
where
my
bare
skin
should
have
been
it
is
nothing
my
women
shall
dress
it
they
have
oils
that
will
cause
the
skin
to
grow
again
within
a
week
a
week
is
nothing
you
and
athelstan
will
be
here
longer
than
a
week
and
you
crossed
the
pool
of
terrors
i
have
crossed
that
too
we
three
are
initiates
now
ye
are
three
who
will
die
unless
discretion
is
the
very
law
ye
live
by
said
the
gray
mahatma
he
seemed
annoyed
about
something
old
laughed
yasmini
snapping
her
fingers
at
him
hah
she
laughed
delightedly
they
have
seen
enough
to
make
them
believe
what
i
shall
tell
them
woman
you
woo
your
own
destruction
none
has
ever
set
out
to
betray
that
secret
and
survived
the
first
offense
he
answered
it
was
who
betrayed
it
to
she
said
with
another
golden
laugh
then
turning
to
king
again
i
have
sought
for
that
secret
day
and
night
india
has
always
known
of
its
existence
and
in
every
generation
some
have
fought
their
way
in
through
the
outer
mysteries
to
the
knowledge
within
but
those
who
enter
always
become
initiates
and
keep
the
secret
i
was
puzzled
how
to
begin
until
i
heard
how
in
england
a
woman
once
overheard
the
secrets
of
freemasonry
and
was
made
a
freemason
in
consequence
now
behold
this
man
they
call
the
gray
mahatma
he
does
as
i
tell
him
you
must
know
that
these
knowers
of
royal
knowledge
as
they
call
themselves
are
not
the
little
birds
in
one
nest
that
they
would
like
to
be
they
quarrel
among
themselves
and
there
is
a
rival
faction
that
knows
only
magic
but
is
more
deadly
bent
on
knowing
royal
knowledge
than
a
wolf
is
determined
to
get
lamb
the
gray
mahatma
saw
fit
to
challenge
some
of
that
statement
it
is
true
that
there
are
wolves
who
seek
to
break
in
he
said
quietly
but
it
is
false
that
there
are
quarrels
among
ourselves
hah
that
little
laugh
of
hers
was
like
the
exclamation
of
a
fellow
who
has
got
home
with
his
rapier
point
quarrels
or
not
she
answered
there
is
a
faction
that
was
more
than
willing
to
use
the
ancient
passage
under
my
palace
grounds
and
to
hold
secret
meetings
in
a
room
that
i
made
ready
for
them
faction
the
gray
mahatma
sneered
faithful
seniors
determined
to
expel
unfaithful
upstarts
are
not
a
faction
at
any
rate
she
chuckled
they
wished
to
hold
a
meeting
unbeknown
to
the
others
and
they
wished
to
make
wonderful
preparations
for
not
being
overheard
and
i
helped
them
is
that
not
so
you
see
they
were
scornful
of
women
then
peace
woman
the
mahatma
growled
does
a
bee
sting
while
it
gathers
honey
you
spied
on
our
secrets
but
did
we
harm
you
for
it
you
did
not
dare
she
retorted
if
i
had
been
alone
you
would
have
destroyed
me
along
with
those
unfortunates
on
whose
account
you
held
the
meeting
it
would
have
been
easy
to
throw
me
to
the
but
you
did
not
know
how
many
women
had
overheard
your
secrets
you
only
knew
that
more
than
one
had
and
that
at
least
ten
women
witnessed
the
fate
of
your
victims
is
that
not
so
victims
is
the
wrong
word
call
them
culprits
said
the
gray
mahatma
what
would
the
government
call
them
she
retorted
the
gray
mahatma
curled
his
lip
but
made
no
answer
to
that
yasmini
turned
to
king
so
i
knew
enough
of
their
secrets
to
oblige
them
either
to
kill
me
or
else
teach
me
all
and
they
did
not
dare
kill
me
because
they
could
not
kill
all
my
women
too
for
fear
of
government
so
first
they
took
me
through
that
ordeal
that
you
went
through
last
night
and
ever
since
then
i
have
been
trying
to
learn
but
this
science
of
theirs
is
difficult
and
i
suspect
them
of
increasing
the
difficulty
for
my
benefit
nevertheless
i
have
mastered
some
of
it
you
have
mastered
none
of
it
the
gray
mahatma
retorted
discourteously
the
golden
light
is
the
first
step
show
me
some
they
thought
they
were
being
too
clever
for
me
she
went
on
they
listened
to
my
suggestion
that
it
might
be
wise
to
show
athelstan
king
the
mysteries
and
send
him
to
america
to
prepare
the
way
for
what
is
coming
so
we
set
a
trap
for
athelstan
and
athelstan
brought
ganesha
with
him
so
now
i
have
two
men
who
know
the
secret
in
addition
to
myself
and
all
my
women
and
i
have
one
man
who
has
skill
enough
to
the
secret
now
that
he
knows
it
perhaps
both
men
can
learn
it
and
i
know
full
well
that
one
can
and
then
king
suggested
you
shall
conquer
the
world
she
answered
king
smiled
and
said
nothing
i
am
uncertain
yet
whether
or
not
i
shall
choose
to
be
queen
of
the
earth
she
said
sometimes
i
think
it
would
be
fun
for
you
and
me
to
be
absolute
king
and
queen
of
everywhere
sometimes
i
think
it
will
be
better
to
make
some
stupid
person
say
ganesha
here
for
instance
king
and
for
ourselves
to
be
the
power
behind
the
throne
what
do
think
athelstan
i
think
he
answered
and
you
observe
that
the
gray
mahatma
likewise
thinks
said
she
he
thinks
what
he
can
do
to
thwart
us
but
i
am
not
afraid
oh
dear
no
i
am
not
at
all
fearful
your
secret
is
not
worth
ten
seconds
purchase
unless
it
is
of
use
to
me
woman
is
your
word
worth
nothing
asked
the
gray
mahatma
you
can
not
use
what
you
know
and
keep
the
secret
too
let
those
two
men
escape
and
the
secret
will
be
blown
to
the
winds
within
the
hour
she
laughed
outright
at
him
they
shall
not
escape
old
just
then
some
of
her
women
brought
a
table
in
and
spread
it
with
dishes
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
yasmini
rose
to
see
whether
all
was
as
she
wished
it
and
i
got
a
chance
not
only
to
look
through
the
curtains
but
also
to
whisper
to
king
he
shook
his
head
in
reply
to
my
question
could
you
manage
for
two
do
you
think
he
asked
and
by
that
i
knew
him
for
a
vastly
more
than
usually
brave
man
consenting
to
what
you
know
is
sure
to
destroy
you
if
the
other
fellow
fails
calls
for
courage
makes
a
two
to
one
chance
of
it
i
answered
very
well
it
a
bet
give
your
orders
said
king
the
mahatma
sat
rigid
in
with
closed
eyes
as
if
praying
his
hands
were
crossed
on
his
breast
and
his
legs
twisted
into
a
nearly
unimaginable
knot
he
looked
almost
comatose
the
shutters
and
the
glass
windows
were
open
wide
to
admit
the
morning
breeze
nothing
was
between
us
and
freedom
but
the
fluttering
silk
curtains
and
a
drop
of
about
seventy
feet
into
an
unknown
river
hold
my
hand
i
said
and
jump
your
limit
outward
the
gray
mahatma
opened
one
eye
and
divined
our
intention
mad
he
exclaimed
so
then
that
is
the
end
of
them
he
believed
what
he
said
for
he
sat
still
but
yasmini
came
running
screaming
to
her
women
to
prevent
us
king
and
i
took
off
together
and
i
take
my
bible
oath
that
i
looked
up
and
saw
yasmini
and
the
gray
mahatma
leaning
out
of
the
window
to
watch
us
drown
of
course
seventy
feet
is
nothing
much
provided
you
are
used
to
the
and
know
the
water
and
have
a
boat
waiting
handy
to
pick
you
up
but
we
had
none
of
these
advantages
and
in
addition
to
that
we
had
the
grievous
handicap
that
king
could
not
swim
a
stroke
we
took
the
water
close
together
and
that
very
instant
i
knew
what
we
were
up
against
as
we
plunged
under
we
were
whirled
against
a
sunken
pole
that
whipped
and
swayed
in
the
current
king
was
wrenched
away
from
me
when
i
fought
my
way
to
the
surface
i
was
already
a
hundred
yards
beyond
the
palace
wall
and
there
was
no
sign
of
king
although
i
could
see
his
turban
pursuing
mine
we
were
caught
in
the
strongest
current
i
had
ever
striven
with
i
do
know
what
persuaded
me
to
turn
and
try
to
swim
against
it
for
a
moment
instinct
i
suppose
it
was
utterly
impossible
i
was
swept
along
backward
almost
as
fast
as
i
had
been
traveling
before
but
what
the
effort
did
do
was
to
bring
me
and
so
i
caught
sight
of
king
clinging
to
a
pole
and
being
bobbed
under
every
time
the
weight
of
water
caused
the
pole
to
duck
i
managed
to
cling
to
a
pole
myself
although
like
king
it
ducked
me
repeatedly
and
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
neither
of
us
would
be
alive
in
the
next
ten
minutes
unless
a
boat
should
come
or
i
should
produce
enough
brawn
and
brain
for
two
of
us
and
there
was
no
boat
in
sight
so
between
ducks
i
yelled
to
king
to
let
go
and
drift
down
toward
me
he
did
it
and
that
i
believe
is
the
utmost
test
of
cold
courage
to
which
i
have
ever
seen
any
man
subjected
for
even
a
strong
swimmer
becomes
when
he
learns
he
is
no
longer
master
of
his
element
king
had
the
and
pluck
to
lie
still
and
drift
down
on
me
like
a
corpse
and
i
let
go
the
pole
in
the
nick
of
time
to
seize
him
as
his
head
went
under
followed
a
battle
royal
fight
how
i
might
i
could
not
keep
both
of
our
heads
out
of
the
water
more
than
half
the
time
and
king
very
soon
lost
the
little
breath
that
was
left
in
him
thereafter
he
struggled
a
bit
but
that
did
not
last
long
and
presently
he
became
unconscious
i
believed
he
was
dead
the
choice
then
seemed
to
lie
between
drowning
too
or
letting
go
of
him
i
did
not
dare
try
the
shallows
for
ninety
per
cent
of
them
are
quicksands
in
that
river
and
more
than
one
army
has
perished
in
the
effort
to
force
its
way
across
the
only
possible
safety
lay
in
keeping
to
and
sweeping
along
with
the
current
until
something
should
turn
up
a
boat
a
log
possibly
a
backwater
or
even
the
breakwater
of
a
bridge
so
i
decided
to
drown
and
to
annoy
the
angels
of
the
underworld
by
taking
as
long
as
possible
in
the
process
and
i
set
to
work
to
fight
as
i
had
never
in
my
whole
life
fought
before
it
was
like
swimming
in
a
millrace
the
current
swirled
us
this
and
that
way
but
everlastingly
forward
sometimes
the
current
rolled
us
over
and
over
on
each
other
but
for
fifty
per
cent
of
the
time
i
managed
to
keep
king
on
top
of
me
i
swimming
on
my
back
and
holding
him
by
both
arms
head
nearly
out
of
the
water
i
ca
explain
exactly
why
i
went
to
all
that
trouble
for
i
was
convinced
he
was
dead
i
remember
wondering
what
the
next
world
was
going
to
be
like
and
whether
king
and
i
would
meet
there
or
whether
we
would
each
be
sent
to
a
sphere
suited
to
our
individual
requirements
and
if
so
what
my
sphere
would
be
like
and
whether
either
of
us
would
ever
meet
yasmini
and
what
she
would
be
doing
there
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
once
that
athelstan
king
might
be
alive
yet
or
that
he
and
i
would
be
presently
treading
mother
earth
again
i
remember
several
terrific
minutes
when
a
big
tree
came
whirling
toward
us
in
an
eddy
and
my
legs
got
tangled
up
in
some
part
of
it
that
was
under
water
then
when
i
managed
to
struggle
free
king
cotton
became
wrapped
in
a
tangle
of
twigs
and
i
could
neither
wrench
nor
break
him
free
whenever
i
tried
it
i
merely
sent
myself
under
and
pulled
his
head
after
me
however
that
tree
suggested
the
possibility
of
prolonging
the
agony
a
while
i
seized
a
branch
and
tried
to
take
advantage
of
it
using
all
my
strength
and
skill
to
keep
the
tree
from
rolling
over
on
king
and
submerging
him
completely
i
can
remember
when
we
whirled
under
the
steel
bridge
and
the
tree
struck
the
breakwater
of
the
middle
pier
that
checked
us
for
a
moment
and
instead
of
sending
us
under
dragged
king
half
out
of
the
water
so
that
he
lay
after
that
on
top
of
a
branch
then
the
stream
got
us
going
again
and
swung
the
butt
end
of
the
tree
around
so
that
i
was
forced
by
it
backward
through
the
arch
of
the
bridge
and
after
that
for
more
than
a
mile
we
were
waltzed
round
and
round
past
where
the
alligators
lay
on
the
for
corpses
from
the
burning
ghats
higher
up
at
last
we
swung
round
a
curve
in
the
river
and
came
on
a
quiet
bay
where
they
were
washing
elephants
the
current
swung
the
tree
inshore
to
a
point
where
it
struck
a
submerged
and
stuck
there
and
there
we
lay
with
the
current
racing
by
and
king
bobbing
up
and
down
with
his
head
out
of
water
and
i
too
weak
by
that
time
to
break
off
the
twig
around
which
his
was
wrapped
well
there
we
were
but
after
a
few
minutes
i
raised
enough
steam
for
the
whistle
at
all
events
i
yelled
until
my
own
seemed
to
be
bursting
and
my
lungs
ached
from
the
pressure
on
the
water
in
them
and
after
what
seemed
an
eternity
one
of
the
mahouts
on
shore
heard
me
hope
surged
triumphant
i
could
see
him
wave
his
arm
and
already
i
saw
visions
of
dry
land
again
and
a
disappointed
yama
but
i
was
overlooking
one
important
point
we
were
in
india
where
rescues
are
not
undertaken
in
a
hurry
he
called
a
conference
i
saw
all
the
mahouts
gather
together
in
one
place
and
stare
at
us
and
talk
they
swung
their
arms
as
they
argued
i
do
know
what
argument
it
was
that
finally
appealed
to
the
mahouts
but
after
an
interminable
session
one
of
them
fetched
a
long
rope
and
nine
or
ten
of
them
climbed
on
the
backs
of
three
big
elephants
they
worked
their
way
a
little
bit
upstream
and
then
came
as
close
as
the
elephants
dared
one
of
the
big
brutes
felt
his
way
cautiously
to
within
twenty
yards
and
then
threw
up
his
trunk
and
refused
to
budge
another
inch
at
that
a
lean
naked
black
man
stood
up
on
his
rump
and
paid
out
the
rope
he
had
to
make
nine
or
ten
attempts
before
it
finally
floated
within
reach
of
my
hand
then
i
made
it
fast
to
the
tree
and
taking
king
in
my
right
arm
started
to
work
my
way
along
it
it
was
just
as
well
i
did
that
and
got
clear
of
the
branch
for
the
mahouts
passed
the
rope
around
the
elephant
neck
and
set
him
to
hauling
he
rolled
the
tree
over
and
over
and
that
would
surely
have
been
the
end
of
king
and
me
if
we
had
been
within
reach
of
the
overturning
branches
as
it
was
i
clung
to
the
rope
and
the
elephant
hauled
the
lot
of
us
high
and
dry
chapter
ix
the
earthquake
elephant
at
the
end
of
a
minute
examination
i
began
to
suspect
that
king
was
not
quite
dead
so
i
recalled
the
old
drill
and
got
to
work
on
him
it
took
time
as
king
came
more
and
more
to
his
senses
and
vomited
a
bit
and
began
to
behave
in
all
ways
like
a
living
man
again
i
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
the
mahouts
and
they
were
just
like
the
members
of
any
other
union
preferring
conversation
to
alleged
hard
labor
any
day
of
the
week
they
told
me
why
the
elephants
were
being
washed
so
early
and
we
enjoyed
a
regular
on
the
beach
it
appeared
the
elephants
were
wanted
to
take
part
in
a
procession
and
for
a
while
they
let
me
guess
what
sort
of
a
procession
but
at
last
they
took
compassion
on
my
ignorance
has
issued
invitations
to
a
party
for
princesses
in
panch
who
was
everybody
knew
who
was
the
princess
yasmini
i
suggested
whereat
they
all
chuckled
and
made
grimaces
and
did
everything
except
acknowledge
her
name
in
public
and
then
suddenly
athelstan
king
decided
to
sit
up
and
spat
some
more
water
out
and
tried
to
laugh
and
they
thought
that
was
so
exquisitely
funny
that
they
all
laughed
too
then
when
he
had
coughed
a
little
more
we
going
to
attend
that
party
why
i
asked
him
two
reasons
but
he
had
to
cough
up
more
water
before
he
could
tell
them
one
the
gray
mahatma
will
never
rest
until
he
knows
we
dead
or
done
for
and
the
safest
place
is
close
to
the
enemy
and
two
i
never
will
rest
until
i
know
the
secret
of
that
science
of
theirs
how
in
thunder
are
we
going
to
get
back
i
objected
ride
he
suggested
how
when
where
elephant
now
to
her
palace
he
answered
they
not
her
elephants
so
much
the
better
she
think
the
maharajah
knows
all
about
us
she
to
accord
us
protection
after
that
he
asked
a
dozen
more
questions
and
finally
struggled
to
his
feet
my
friend
he
said
then
to
the
chief
mahout
if
you
propose
to
take
us
two
to
palace
and
be
back
at
your
master
stables
in
time
to
get
ready
for
the
you
have
to
hurry
but
i
did
not
propose
it
the
mahout
answered
nay
the
gods
proposed
it
which
is
your
fastest
elephant
that
great
one
yonder
akbar
but
who
is
giving
orders
we
are
a
maharajah
servants
the
gods
are
ordering
all
this
business
king
assured
him
i
wish
to
ride
to
palace
by
leave
by
the
gods
leave
will
the
gods
pay
me
doubtless
but
she
will
pay
first
setting
the
gods
a
good
example
the
native
of
india
finds
it
perfectly
convenient
to
ride
on
a
plank
slung
more
or
less
like
a
platform
against
an
elephant
bulging
ribs
and
it
does
not
seem
to
make
much
difference
to
him
when
more
weight
is
on
one
side
than
on
the
other
but
king
and
i
had
to
stand
and
hold
each
other
hands
across
the
pad
and
even
so
we
were
by
no
means
too
secure
for
akbar
resented
being
taken
away
from
the
herd
and
behaved
like
a
mutinous
earthquake
it
was
not
so
far
to
the
city
by
road
because
the
river
wound
a
good
deal
and
the
road
cut
straight
from
point
to
point
but
it
was
several
miles
and
we
covered
it
at
pretty
nearly
the
speed
of
a
railroad
train
in
spite
of
his
rage
akbar
had
perfect
control
of
himself
having
missed
about
half
his
morning
swim
and
the
herd
society
he
proposed
to
miss
nothing
else
and
there
was
not
one
cart
one
one
load
in
all
those
miles
that
he
did
not
hit
and
do
his
utmost
to
destroy
there
was
not
one
yellow
dog
that
he
did
not
give
chase
to
and
try
to
trample
on
he
stopped
to
pull
the
thatch
from
the
roof
of
a
little
house
beside
the
road
but
as
the
plying
made
his
head
ache
he
could
stay
long
enough
to
finish
that
job
but
scooted
uproad
again
in
full
pursuit
of
a
ford
car
while
an
angry
man
shoved
his
head
through
the
hole
in
the
roof
of
the
house
and
cursed
all
the
rumps
of
all
the
elephants
together
with
the
forebears
and
descendants
of
their
owners
and
their
wives
it
seemed
that
akbar
was
fairly
thereabouts
the
men
in
the
ford
car
shouted
the
news
in
advance
of
his
coming
and
the
road
into
the
city
began
to
look
like
the
track
of
a
routed
army
every
man
and
animal
took
to
his
heels
and
akbar
trumpeted
wild
hurrahs
as
he
strained
all
tendons
in
pursuit
he
needed
no
second
wind
because
he
never
lost
his
first
but
he
took
the
whole
course
as
far
as
the
city
gate
at
a
speed
that
would
have
satisfied
jehu
son
of
nimshi
who
the
bible
says
made
israel
to
sin
that
particular
city
gate
consisted
of
an
arch
covered
with
carvings
of
gods
and
as
a
picture
display
it
was
perfect
but
as
an
entrance
to
a
crowded
city
it
possessed
no
virtue
it
was
so
narrow
that
only
one
vehicle
could
pass
at
a
time
and
the
whole
swarm
jammed
between
it
and
us
like
sticks
in
front
of
a
drain
and
not
even
akbar
strength
was
so
great
that
he
could
shove
them
through
so
the
ancient
problem
of
an
irresistible
force
in
contact
with
an
immovable
object
was
presented
and
solved
by
akbar
after
a
fashion
of
his
own
he
picked
the
softest
spot
which
was
a
of
cotton
bales
and
upset
it
cannoning
off
that
cushion
so
swiftly
as
to
come
within
an
ace
of
scattering
his
four
passengers
across
the
landscape
and
discerning
with
a
swift
strategic
eye
that
would
have
done
credit
to
the
dashingest
cavalry
general
that
that
rout
was
complete
and
nothing
could
be
gained
by
adding
to
it
he
headed
for
the
river
and
the
women
bathing
place
took
the
broad
stone
steps
at
a
dead
run
and
plunged
straight
in
no
ship
was
ever
launched
with
more
perfect
aplomb
nor
floated
more
superbly
on
an
even
keel
than
did
akbar
at
the
women
bathing
ghat
for
a
moment
i
thought
he
proposed
to
lie
down
there
and
finish
his
interrupted
toilet
but
he
contented
himself
with
squirting
water
on
the
sore
spot
caused
by
the
thumping
of
the
driver
and
set
out
to
swim
upstream
it
was
not
until
he
had
reached
the
second
ghat
and
climbed
the
steps
there
that
akbar
put
himself
in
napoleon
class
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
steps
no
amount
of
whacking
with
the
could
make
him
turn
to
the
right
and
follow
the
city
street
he
turned
to
the
left
tooted
a
couple
of
wild
hurrahs
through
his
newly
wetted
whistle
and
raced
to
meet
the
traffic
as
it
struggled
through
the
gate
in
single
file
there
was
ruin
ripe
for
harvest
and
it
looked
like
the
proper
time
to
jump
but
suddenly
with
that
delightful
wheeled
panic
at
his
mercy
the
big
brute
stopped
stood
still
and
looked
at
them
muttering
and
gurgling
to
himself
instantly
the
mahout
began
petting
him
calling
him
endearing
names
and
praising
his
wisdom
and
discretion
i
ca
swear
that
the
beast
understood
what
was
said
to
him
but
he
acted
exactly
as
if
he
did
he
picked
up
dust
from
the
street
with
his
trunk
blew
a
little
of
it
in
the
general
direction
of
the
defeated
enemy
blew
a
little
more
on
himself
and
turned
his
rump
toward
the
gate
as
if
to
signify
that
hostilities
were
over
as
he
did
that
a
man
who
was
something
of
an
athlete
swung
himself
up
on
the
footboard
and
a
second
later
the
proud
face
of
the
gray
mahatma
confronted
me
across
the
alongside
king
you
are
heavy
enough
to
balance
the
two
of
us
he
said
as
if
no
other
comment
were
necessary
why
did
you
run
away
from
me
you
can
never
escape
well
of
course
anybody
could
say
that
after
he
had
found
us
again
was
it
you
who
checked
this
elephant
i
asked
him
remembering
what
he
had
done
to
the
black
panther
and
the
snakes
but
he
did
not
answer
where
do
you
think
you
are
going
i
asked
that
is
what
the
dry
leaves
asked
of
the
wind
he
answered
an
observant
eye
is
better
than
a
yearning
ear
and
patience
outwears
curiosity
suddenly
i
recalled
a
remark
that
king
had
made
on
the
beach
and
it
dawned
on
me
that
by
frightening
the
mahout
into
silence
the
mahatma
might
undo
the
one
gain
we
had
made
by
that
plunge
and
swim
as
long
as
the
maharajah
who
owned
the
elephant
was
to
hear
about
our
adventure
all
was
well
news
of
us
would
reach
the
government
most
of
the
maharajahs
are
because
their
very
existence
as
reigning
princes
depends
on
that
attitude
and
they
can
be
relied
on
to
report
to
the
british
authorities
any
irregularity
whatever
that
comes
under
their
notice
and
at
the
same
time
does
not
incriminate
themselves
the
same
thought
probably
occurred
to
king
but
he
was
rather
too
recently
recovered
from
drowning
to
be
quick
yet
off
the
mark
and
besides
the
mahatma
was
between
him
and
the
mahout
whereas
i
had
a
free
field
so
i
tugged
at
the
arm
of
the
second
mahout
who
was
sitting
behind
his
chief
and
he
scrambled
down
beside
me
the
mahatma
tried
to
take
immediate
advantage
of
that
and
the
very
thing
he
did
made
it
all
the
easier
for
me
to
deal
with
the
second
mahout
who
had
made
the
trip
with
us
and
who
stared
into
my
face
with
a
kind
of
puzzled
mistrust
the
mahatma
as
active
as
a
cat
climbed
up
behind
the
chief
mahout
and
sat
astride
the
elephant
neck
in
the
place
where
the
second
mahout
had
been
and
began
whispering
what
is
your
maharajah
name
i
asked
my
neighbor
on
the
plank
jihanbihar
he
answered
giving
a
string
of
titles
too
that
had
no
particular
bearing
on
the
situation
they
sounded
like
a
page
of
the
old
testament
you
observe
that
his
favorite
elephant
is
about
to
be
stolen
with
the
aid
of
the
gray
mahatma
the
fellow
nodded
and
the
expression
of
his
face
was
not
exactly
pleased
he
may
have
been
one
of
a
crowd
that
got
cursed
by
the
mahatma
for
asking
too
many
impertinent
questions
he
has
a
reputation
that
mahatma
has
he
i
suggested
you
have
heard
of
the
miracles
that
he
performs
he
nodded
again
you
see
that
he
is
talking
to
the
chief
mahout
now
take
my
word
for
it
he
is
casting
a
spell
on
him
would
you
like
to
have
him
cast
a
spell
on
you
too
he
shook
his
head
run
swiftly
then
and
tell
the
maharajah
to
get
a
brahman
to
cancel
the
spell
and
you
will
be
rewarded
go
quickly
he
dropped
from
the
plank
and
went
off
at
a
run
just
as
the
mahatma
turned
and
saw
him
the
mahatma
had
been
whispering
in
the
mahout
ear
and
as
his
eye
met
mine
i
laughed
for
a
moment
he
watched
the
man
running
and
then
as
if
to
demonstrate
what
a
strange
mixture
of
a
man
he
was
he
laughed
back
at
me
he
acknowledged
defeat
instantly
and
did
not
appear
in
the
least
annoyed
by
it
but
on
the
contrary
appeared
to
accord
me
credit
for
outwitting
him
as
undoubtedly
i
had
india
is
not
a
democratic
country
nobody
is
troubled
about
keeping
the
underworld
in
its
place
so
mahout
or
sweeper
has
the
ear
of
majesty
as
readily
as
any
other
man
if
not
even
more
so
and
it
would
not
make
the
slightest
difference
now
what
kind
of
cock
and
bull
story
the
mahout
might
tell
to
the
maharajah
however
wild
it
might
be
it
would
certainly
include
the
fact
that
two
white
men
had
ridden
to
yasmini
palace
on
the
maharajah
favorite
elephant
after
having
been
fished
out
of
the
river
by
mahouts
at
the
elephant
bathing
ghat
it
was
the
likeliest
thing
in
the
world
that
representations
would
be
made
that
very
afternoon
by
telegraph
to
the
nearest
important
british
official
who
would
feel
compelled
to
make
inquiries
the
british
government
can
not
afford
to
have
even
unknown
white
men
mysteriously
made
away
with
the
gray
mahatma
took
all
that
for
granted
and
nodded
comprehendingly
his
smile
as
we
neared
yasmini
palace
gate
appeared
to
me
to
include
a
perfect
appreciation
of
the
situation
he
seemed
to
accept
it
as
candidly
as
he
had
acknowledged
my
frequent
escapes
the
night
before
ismail
opened
the
gate
without
demur
and
akbar
sauntered
in
being
used
to
palaces
he
passed
under
the
first
arch
into
the
second
courtyard
coming
to
a
halt
at
a
gate
on
the
far
side
that
was
too
small
for
his
enormous
bulk
where
he
proceeded
to
kneel
without
waiting
for
instructions
do
you
feel
proud
the
mahatma
asked
me
unexpectedly
as
he
climbed
off
akbar
neck
suspecting
some
sort
of
verbal
trap
i
did
not
answer
him
you
are
like
this
elephant
you
are
able
to
do
irreparable
damage
if
you
see
fit
was
as
apt
as
usual
when
she
dubbed
you
ganesha
he
was
working
toward
some
point
he
intended
to
make
like
one
of
those
attorneys
flattering
a
witness
before
tying
him
up
in
a
knot
so
i
was
careful
to
say
nothing
whatever
king
came
around
the
kneeling
elephant
and
joined
us
leaning
back
against
the
beast
and
appraising
the
mahatma
with
his
eyes
you
dealing
with
white
men
king
suggested
why
do
you
talk
in
terms
that
we
understand
it
seemed
difficult
for
the
mahatma
to
descend
to
that
he
his
eyes
in
turn
and
frowned
as
if
hard
put
to
it
to
simplify
his
thoughts
sufficiently
something
like
a
mathematician
trying
to
explain
himself
to
the
kindergarten
class
i
could
kill
you
he
said
looking
straight
at
king
king
nodded
you
are
not
the
kind
of
man
who
be
killed
he
went
on
did
you
ever
hear
the
fable
of
the
fox
and
the
sour
grapes
king
asked
him
and
the
mahatma
looked
annoyed
would
you
rather
be
killed
he
retorted
my
soul
i
inclined
to
leave
that
to
the
outcome
king
answered
death
would
mean
investigation
and
investigation
discovery
of
that
science
you
gave
us
a
glimpse
of
if
i
was
to
let
you
go
the
mahatma
began
to
argue
i
would
not
go
forward
is
the
only
way
king
interrupted
you
a
reason
for
not
having
us
two
men
killed
what
is
it
i
have
no
reason
whatever
for
preserving
this
one
life
the
mahatma
answered
glancing
at
me
casually
for
reasons
beyond
my
power
of
guessing
he
seems
to
bear
a
charmed
existence
but
he
has
my
leave
to
visit
the
next
world
and
his
departure
would
by
no
means
inconvenience
me
but
you
are
another
matter
how
so
king
asked
ramsden
is
the
man
who
would
be
inquired
for
the
indian
government
whose
servant
i
no
longer
am
might
ignore
me
but
the
who
is
ramsden
partner
would
spend
millions
and
make
an
international
scandal
i
am
thinking
of
you
not
of
him
i
am
thinking
you
are
honest
said
the
gray
mahatma
looking
into
king
eyes
so
is
he
king
answered
i
am
wondering
whether
or
not
you
are
honest
enough
to
trust
me
said
the
gray
mahatma
why
certainly
king
answered
if
you
would
commit
yourself
i
would
trust
you
why
not
but
this
man
would
not
said
the
mahatma
nudging
me
as
if
i
were
the
elephant
i
trust
my
friend
king
i
retorted
if
he
decides
to
trust
you
i
stand
back
of
him
very
well
then
let
us
exchange
promises
suppose
we
go
a
little
more
cautiously
and
discuss
them
first
suggested
king
i
will
promise
both
of
you
your
life
your
eventual
freedom
and
my
friendship
will
you
promise
me
not
to
go
in
league
with
i
agree
to
that
unconditionally
king
assured
him
with
a
dry
not
to
try
to
learn
the
secret
of
the
science
why
not
because
if
you
try
i
could
never
save
your
lives
well
what
else
will
you
take
oath
never
to
disclose
the
whereabouts
of
the
entrance
to
the
caverns
in
which
you
were
allowed
to
see
the
sciences
i
shall
have
to
think
that
over
furthermore
will
you
promise
to
take
whatever
means
is
pointed
out
to
you
of
helping
india
to
independence
what
do
you
mean
by
independence
i
been
working
for
that
ever
since
i
cut
my
answered
king
so
has
every
other
british
officer
and
civil
servant
who
has
any
sense
of
public
duty
will
you
continue
to
work
for
it
and
employ
the
means
that
shall
be
pointed
out
to
you
yes
is
the
answer
to
the
first
part
ca
answer
the
second
part
until
i
studied
the
means
will
you
join
me
in
preventing
that
princess
from
throwing
the
world
into
fresh
confusion
dunno
about
joining
you
it
part
of
my
business
to
prevent
her
little
game
king
answered
she
has
proven
herself
almost
too
clever
even
for
us
said
the
mahatma
she
spied
on
us
and
she
hid
so
many
witnesses
behind
a
wall
pierced
with
holes
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
make
sure
of
destroying
all
of
them
and
somewhere
or
other
she
has
hidden
an
account
of
what
she
knows
so
that
if
anything
should
happen
to
her
it
would
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
government
and
compel
investigation
wise
woman
king
said
smiling
yes
but
not
so
altogether
wise
hitherto
we
fooled
her
for
all
her
cleverness
her
price
of
silence
was
education
in
our
mysteries
and
we
have
made
the
education
incomprehensible
then
why
do
you
want
my
help
because
she
has
a
plan
now
that
is
so
magnificent
in
its
audacity
as
to
baffle
even
our
secret
council
king
whistled
and
the
mahatma
looked
annoyed
whether
with
himself
or
king
i
was
not
sure
that
is
what
i
have
been
hunting
for
three
years
your
secret
council
i
knew
it
existed
never
could
prove
it
said
king
can
you
prove
it
now
asked
the
mahatma
with
even
more
visible
annoyance
i
think
so
you
have
to
help
me
i
you
or
the
princess
king
answered
shall
i
join
you
or
her
thou
fool
there
was
a
sheep
who
asked
shall
i
run
with
tiger
or
wolf
consider
that
a
moment
king
showed
him
the
courtesy
of
considering
it
and
was
silent
for
perhaps
two
minutes
during
which
the
mahout
judged
it
opportune
to
whine
forth
his
own
demands
but
nobody
took
any
notice
of
him
you
seem
to
me
king
said
at
last
you
dare
kill
my
friend
or
me
you
dare
make
away
with
us
you
dare
make
away
with
the
princess
the
princess
and
several
of
her
women
know
enough
of
your
secret
to
be
able
to
force
your
hand
so
do
my
friend
ramsden
and
ramsden
and
i
have
seen
sufficient
in
that
madhouse
underneath
the
temple
to
compel
a
government
inquiry
is
it
peace
or
war
mahatma
will
you
introduce
me
to
your
secret
council
or
will
you
fight
to
a
finish
i
would
rather
not
fight
with
you
my
young
friend
introduce
me
then
king
answered
smiling
you
do
know
what
you
ask
what
that
involves
but
i
propose
to
know
said
king
the
mahatma
never
seemed
to
mind
acknowledging
defeat
i
see
you
are
determined
he
said
quietly
determination
my
young
friend
combined
with
ignorance
is
a
murderer
nine
times
out
of
ten
however
you
do
not
understand
that
and
you
are
determined
i
have
no
authority
to
make
such
terms
as
you
propose
but
i
will
submit
the
matter
to
those
whom
you
desire
to
meet
does
that
satisfy
you
king
looked
immensely
dissatisfied
i
would
rather
be
your
friend
than
your
enemy
he
answered
so
said
light
and
darkness
each
to
the
other
when
they
first
met
you
shall
have
your
answer
presently
in
the
mean
time
will
you
try
not
to
make
my
task
even
more
difficult
than
it
already
is
king
laughed
uncomfortably
mahatma
i
like
you
well
enough
but
no
terms
until
i
have
your
answer
sorry
i
like
to
be
friends
with
you
the
pity
of
it
is
that
though
you
are
honestly
determined
you
are
bound
to
fail
the
mahatma
answered
and
at
that
he
dismissed
the
whole
subject
with
a
motion
of
one
hand
and
turned
toward
ismail
who
was
lurking
about
in
the
shadows
like
a
wolf
the
mahatma
sent
the
man
to
the
door
of
the
with
a
message
that
money
was
needed
and
the
mahout
spent
the
next
ten
minutes
in
loud
praises
of
his
kneeling
elephant
presumably
on
the
theory
that
it
pays
to
advertise
for
it
is
not
only
the
west
that
worships
at
that
shrine
when
ismail
came
back
with
a
tray
on
which
were
several
little
heaps
of
money
the
mahout
went
into
abject
ecstasies
of
mingled
jubilee
and
reverence
his
mouth
betrayed
unbelief
and
his
eyes
glinted
avarice
his
fingers
twitched
with
agonied
anticipation
and
he
began
to
praise
his
elephant
again
as
some
people
recite
proverbs
to
keep
themselves
from
getting
too
excited
the
various
heaps
of
money
on
the
tray
must
have
amounted
to
about
fifty
dollars
the
mahout
spread
out
the
end
of
his
turban
by
way
of
begging
bowl
and
the
mahatma
shook
all
the
money
into
it
so
that
ismail
gasped
and
the
mahout
himself
turned
up
his
eyes
in
exquisite
delirium
go
or
you
will
be
too
late
was
all
the
mahatma
said
to
him
and
the
mahout
did
not
wait
for
a
second
command
but
mounted
his
neck
kicked
the
big
brute
up
and
rode
away
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
before
he
should
wake
up
and
discover
that
the
whole
adventure
was
a
dream
but
he
could
not
get
away
with
it
as
easily
as
all
that
ismail
was
keeper
of
the
gate
and
the
gate
was
locked
akbar
doubtless
could
have
broken
down
the
gate
if
so
instructed
but
even
the
east
which
is
never
long
on
gratitude
would
hardly
do
that
much
damage
after
receiving
such
a
royal
largesse
ismail
went
to
unlock
the
gate
and
demanded
his
percentage
giving
it
though
the
eastern
name
which
means
the
usual
thing
and
the
usual
argument
took
place
i
approached
to
listen
to
it
the
usual
recriminations
threats
counterclaims
abuse
appeals
to
various
deaf
deities
and
finally
concession
after
ismail
had
made
the
threat
to
tell
the
other
mahouts
how
much
the
gift
had
amounted
to
i
suppose
it
was
instinct
that
suggested
that
idea
at
any
rate
it
worked
and
the
mahout
threw
a
handful
of
coins
to
him
thereat
of
course
there
was
immediate
immense
politeness
on
both
sides
ismail
prayed
that
allah
might
make
the
mahout
as
potbellied
and
idle
as
his
elephant
and
the
mahout
suggested
to
a
dozen
corruptible
deities
that
ismail
might
be
happier
with
a
thousand
children
and
wives
who
were
true
to
him
whereat
ismail
opened
the
gate
and
akbar
helped
himself
liberally
to
from
a
passing
wagon
so
that
every
one
was
satisfied
except
the
rightful
owner
of
the
who
cursed
and
wept
and
called
akbar
an
honest
rajah
by
way
i
suppose
of
expressing
his
opinion
of
all
the
powers
that
be
there
happened
to
be
a
thing
they
call
a
constabeel
going
by
and
the
owner
of
the
appealed
to
him
for
justice
and
relief
so
the
constabeel
prodded
akbar
rump
with
his
truncheon
and
helped
himself
too
to
by
way
of
balancing
accounts
and
while
the
owner
of
the
was
bellowing
red
doctrine
about
that
ismail
went
out
and
helped
himself
likewise
only
more
liberally
carrying
in
an
armful
of
the
stuff
and
slamming
the
gate
in
the
faces
of
all
concerned
in
cynical
enjoyment
of
the
blasphemy
outside
he
sat
down
then
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
to
chew
the
cane
and
count
the
change
extorted
from
the
mahout
behold
india
i
said
turning
to
beckon
through
the
arch
between
the
two
courtyards
but
the
mahatma
was
gone
and
unlike
the
cheshire
cat
he
had
not
even
left
a
smile
behind
him
had
not
even
left
athelstan
king
behind
him
the
two
had
disappeared
as
silently
and
as
utterly
as
if
they
had
never
been
there
chapter
x
a
date
with
doom
i
hunted
about
looked
around
corners
searched
the
next
courtyard
and
drew
blank
then
i
asked
ismail
and
he
mocked
me
the
mahatma
you
are
like
those
fools
who
pursue
virtue
there
never
was
any
that
mahout
named
you
rightly
just
now
said
i
he
knew
your
character
perfectly
that
may
be
ismail
answered
rising
to
his
feet
but
he
was
on
an
elephant
where
i
could
not
reach
him
you
think
you
are
a
strong
man
feel
of
that
then
he
was
old
but
no
mean
adversary
luckily
for
him
he
did
not
draw
a
knife
i
hugged
the
wind
out
of
him
whirled
him
until
he
was
dizzy
and
threw
him
down
into
his
dog
corner
by
the
gate
not
much
the
worse
except
for
a
bruise
or
two
now
i
said
which
way
went
king
sahib
and
the
gray
mahatma
all
ways
are
one
and
the
one
way
leads
to
that
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
him
so
i
took
the
one
way
straight
down
through
the
courtyards
and
under
the
arches
past
the
old
black
panther
cage
the
way
that
king
and
i
had
taken
when
we
first
arrived
but
it
seemed
like
a
year
since
i
had
trodden
those
ancient
flagstones
side
by
side
with
king
more
than
a
year
it
seemed
as
if
a
dozen
lifetimes
intervened
and
it
also
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
growing
famished
and
desperately
sleepy
and
i
knew
that
king
must
be
in
even
worse
condition
the
old
black
panther
was
sleeping
as
i
went
by
and
i
envied
him
there
was
a
choice
of
two
ways
when
i
reached
the
for
it
was
feasible
to
enter
through
the
lower
door
which
was
apparently
unguarded
and
climb
the
stone
stairway
that
wound
inside
the
wall
however
i
chose
the
marble
front
steps
and
barked
my
knuckles
on
the
door
at
the
top
i
was
kept
waiting
several
minutes
and
then
four
women
opened
it
in
place
of
the
customary
two
and
instead
of
smiling
as
on
previous
occasions
they
frowned
lining
up
across
the
threshold
they
were
older
women
than
the
others
had
been
and
looked
perfectly
capable
of
showing
fight
allowing
for
their
long
pins
and
possible
hidden
weapons
i
would
not
have
given
ten
cents
for
my
chance
against
them
so
i
asked
for
king
and
the
mahatma
they
pretended
not
to
understand
they
knew
no
hindustani
my
dialect
of
punjabi
was
as
greek
to
them
they
knew
nothing
about
my
clothes
or
the
suitcase
that
king
and
i
shared
between
us
and
that
according
to
yasmini
had
been
carried
by
her
orders
to
the
palace
the
words
king
and
mahatma
seemed
to
convey
no
meaning
to
them
they
made
it
perfectly
obvious
that
they
suspected
me
of
being
mad
i
began
to
suspect
myself
of
the
same
thing
feeling
as
sleepy
as
i
did
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
suspect
myself
at
any
rate
of
dreaming
yet
i
had
sufficient
power
of
reasoning
left
to
argue
that
if
those
were
they
would
give
way
in
front
of
me
so
i
stepped
straight
forward
and
they
no
more
gave
way
than
a
will
if
you
call
on
her
when
she
is
nursing
cubs
two
more
women
stepped
out
from
behind
the
curtains
with
long
slithery
daggers
in
their
hands
and
somehow
i
was
not
minded
to
test
whether
those
were
or
not
it
was
a
puzzle
to
know
what
to
do
the
one
unthinkable
thing
would
be
to
leave
king
unsought
for
suddenly
it
occurred
to
me
to
try
that
door
underneath
the
steps
so
i
kissed
my
hand
irreverently
to
the
quarterguard
of
harridans
and
turned
my
back
on
them
which
i
daresay
was
the
most
unwise
move
that
i
ever
made
in
my
whole
life
i
have
done
things
that
were
more
disastrous
in
the
outcome
but
never
anything
more
deserving
of
ruin
have
you
ever
been
tackled
tripped
and
by
women
run
rather
than
risk
it
they
threw
a
rope
over
my
shoulders
from
behind
and
i
felt
the
foot
of
one
termagant
in
the
small
of
my
back
as
she
hauled
taut
i
spun
round
and
stepped
forward
to
slacken
the
noose
and
free
myself
and
two
more
nooses
went
over
my
head
in
swift
succession
another
caught
my
right
foot
another
my
right
hand
more
women
came
with
more
ropes
it
was
only
a
matter
of
seconds
before
they
were
almost
dragging
me
asunder
as
they
hauled
two
hags
to
a
rope
and
every
one
of
them
straining
as
if
the
game
were
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
plenty
of
inducement
so
i
did
it
i
yelled
i
sent
my
voice
bellowing
through
those
echoing
halls
to
such
tune
that
if
king
were
anywhere
in
the
place
he
would
have
to
hear
me
but
it
did
me
no
good
they
only
produced
a
gag
and
added
that
to
my
discomfort
shoving
a
great
lump
of
rubber
in
my
mouth
and
wrapping
a
towel
over
it
so
tightly
that
i
could
hardly
breathe
then
came
yasmini
gorgeously
amused
standing
at
the
top
of
the
steps
where
the
inner
hall
was
raised
a
few
feet
above
the
outer
and
ordering
me
blindfolded
as
well
as
rendered
dumb
for
if
he
can
see
as
well
as
he
can
roar
he
will
presently
know
too
much
she
explained
sarcastically
so
they
wrapped
another
towel
over
my
eyes
and
pinned
it
with
a
cursed
export
that
pierced
clean
through
my
scalp
and
the
harder
i
struggled
the
tighter
they
pulled
on
the
ropes
and
the
louder
yasmini
laughed
until
i
might
as
well
have
been
on
that
rack
that
king
and
i
saw
in
the
cavern
underneath
the
temple
so
strong
she
mocked
so
strong
and
yet
so
impotent
such
muscles
look
at
them
can
the
buffalo
hear
or
are
his
ears
stopped
too
a
woman
rearranged
the
to
make
sure
that
my
ears
were
missing
nothing
after
which
yasmini
purred
her
pleasantest
o
buffalo
ganesha
i
would
have
you
whipped
to
death
if
i
thought
that
would
not
anger
athelstan
what
do
you
mistake
me
for
me
who
have
been
twice
a
queen
that
was
a
mighty
jump
from
my
window
and
even
as
the
buffalo
you
swam
ganesha
buffalo
buffalo
who
but
a
buffalo
would
snatch
my
athelstan
away
from
me
and
then
return
alone
what
have
you
done
with
him
hah
you
would
like
to
answer
that
you
have
done
nothing
with
him
buffalo
buffalo
he
would
never
have
left
you
willingly
nor
you
him
you
two
companions
who
share
one
foolish
little
bag
between
you
does
he
love
you
hope
ganesha
hope
that
he
loves
you
for
unless
he
comes
to
find
you
ganesha
all
the
horrors
that
you
saw
last
night
and
all
the
deaths
and
all
the
tortures
shall
be
yours
with
alligators
at
last
to
abolish
the
last
traces
of
you
do
you
like
snakes
ganesha
do
you
like
a
madhouse
in
the
dark
i
think
not
therefore
ganesha
you
shall
be
left
to
yourself
to
think
a
little
while
think
keenly
invent
a
means
of
finding
athelstan
and
i
will
let
you
go
free
for
his
sake
but
fail
to
think
of
a
successful
plan
ganesha
and
you
shall
suffer
in
every
atom
of
your
big
body
bass
take
him
away
i
was
and
flung
on
to
cushions
after
which
i
heard
a
door
snap
shut
and
had
leisure
to
work
myself
free
from
the
ropes
and
gag
and
towels
it
took
time
for
the
hussies
had
drawn
the
cords
until
they
bit
into
the
muscles
and
maybe
i
was
twenty
minutes
about
getting
loose
then
for
ten
minutes
more
i
sat
and
chafed
the
craving
food
examining
the
room
and
wishing
above
all
things
that
conscience
would
let
me
fall
asleep
on
the
feathery
scented
pillows
with
which
the
floor
was
strewn
rather
than
stay
awake
on
the
of
discovering
where
king
might
be
it
was
practically
a
bare
room
having
walls
of
painted
wood
that
sounded
solid
when
i
made
the
circuit
of
the
floor
and
tapped
each
panel
in
turn
but
that
proved
nothing
for
even
the
door
sounded
equally
solid
the
folk
who
built
that
palace
used
solid
timber
not
veneer
and
as
i
found
out
afterward
the
door
was
nearly
a
foot
thick
on
the
floor
i
could
make
no
impression
whatever
by
thumping
and
there
was
no
furniture
except
the
pillows
nothing
that
i
could
use
for
a
weapon
but
there
were
the
cotton
ropes
with
which
they
had
bound
me
and
before
doing
anything
else
i
knotted
them
all
into
one
i
had
no
particular
reason
for
doing
that
beyond
the
general
principle
that
one
long
rope
is
usually
better
than
a
short
ones
in
most
emergencies
there
was
only
one
window
and
that
was
perhaps
two
feet
high
big
enough
that
is
to
scramble
through
but
practically
inaccessible
and
barred
the
only
weapon
i
had
was
that
infernal
brass
that
had
held
the
towel
to
my
scalp
and
i
stuck
that
away
in
my
clothes
like
a
magpie
hiding
things
on
general
principles
i
began
to
wonder
whether
it
would
not
be
wisest
after
all
to
lie
down
and
sleep
but
i
was
too
hungry
to
sleep
and
it
was
recognition
of
that
fact
which
produced
the
right
idea
beyond
doubt
yasmini
realized
that
i
was
hungry
she
had
threatened
me
with
tortures
and
was
likely
to
inflict
them
if
she
should
think
that
necessary
but
nothing
seemed
more
unlikely
than
that
she
would
keep
me
for
the
present
without
food
and
water
it
would
be
bad
strategy
to
say
the
least
of
it
she
had
admitted
that
she
did
not
want
to
offend
king
the
more
i
considered
that
the
more
worth
while
it
seemed
to
bet
on
it
and
as
i
had
nothing
to
bet
with
except
will
power
and
personal
convenience
i
plunged
with
both
and
determined
to
stay
awake
as
long
as
human
endurance
could
hold
out
there
was
only
one
way
that
food
could
possibly
be
brought
into
the
room
and
that
was
through
the
massive
door
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
and
opened
inward
there
were
no
bolts
on
the
inside
anybody
opening
it
cautiously
would
be
able
to
see
instantly
all
down
the
length
of
half
that
wall
and
possibly
two
thirds
of
the
room
as
well
it
would
have
been
hardly
practical
to
stand
against
the
door
and
hit
at
the
first
head
that
showed
for
then
if
the
door
should
open
suddenly
it
would
strike
me
and
give
the
alarm
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
but
to
stand
well
back
against
the
wall
on
the
side
of
the
door
on
which
the
hinges
were
and
as
that
would
make
the
range
too
long
for
quick
action
i
had
to
invent
some
other
means
of
dealing
with
the
owner
of
the
first
head
than
jumping
in
and
punching
it
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
contrive
a
trap
with
but
the
cotton
rope
and
the
but
the
like
mohammed
allah
made
all
things
possible
i
stuck
that
in
the
woodwork
and
hung
the
noose
in
such
position
that
the
least
jerk
would
bring
it
down
over
an
intruding
head
practised
the
stunt
for
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
and
then
got
well
back
against
the
wall
with
the
end
of
the
line
in
hand
and
waited
i
have
read
izaak
walton
and
continue
unconvinced
i
still
class
fishing
and
golf
together
with
tiddledywinks
and
eschew
all
three
as
thoughtfully
as
i
avoid
bazaars
and
crushes
given
by
the
ladies
of
both
sexes
the
rest
of
that
performance
was
too
much
like
fishing
with
a
worm
to
suit
my
temperament
and
although
i
caught
more
in
the
end
than
i
ever
took
with
rod
and
line
the
next
was
boredom
pure
and
simple
multiplied
to
the
point
of
torture
by
intense
yearning
for
sleep
but
patience
sometimes
is
rewarded
i
very
nearly
was
asleep
when
the
sound
of
a
bolt
being
drawn
on
the
far
side
of
the
door
brought
every
sense
to
the
alert
with
that
stinging
feeling
that
means
blood
spurting
through
your
veins
after
a
spell
of
lethargy
the
bolt
was
a
long
time
drawing
as
if
some
one
were
afraid
of
making
too
much
noise
and
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
make
sure
that
my
trap
was
in
working
order
and
when
the
door
opened
gingerly
at
last
a
head
inserted
itself
my
noose
fell
and
i
hauled
taut
i
do
know
which
was
most
surprised
myself
or
the
gray
mahatma
i
jerked
the
noose
so
tight
that
he
could
not
breathe
let
alone
argue
the
point
i
reckon
i
nearly
hanged
him
for
his
neck
jammed
against
the
door
and
i
did
not
dare
let
go
for
fear
he
might
withdraw
himself
and
collapse
on
the
wrong
side
i
wanted
him
and
in
a
hurry
he
was
about
unconscious
when
i
seized
him
by
his
one
long
lock
of
hair
and
hauled
him
in
shutting
the
door
again
and
leaning
my
weight
against
it
while
i
pried
the
noose
free
to
save
him
from
sure
death
those
cotton
ropes
do
render
the
way
a
hemp
one
would
and
while
i
was
doing
that
a
sickening
utterly
unexpected
sound
announced
that
somebody
outside
the
door
had
cautiously
shot
the
bolt
again
the
mahatma
and
i
were
both
prisoners
i
sat
the
old
fellow
down
on
a
cushion
in
a
corner
and
chafed
his
neck
until
the
blood
performed
its
normal
office
of
revivifying
him
and
as
he
slowly
opened
first
one
eye
and
then
the
other
instead
of
cursing
me
as
i
expected
he
actually
smiled
the
quality
of
your
mercy
was
rather
too
well
strained
he
said
in
english
but
i
thank
you
for
the
offer
nevertheless
offer
i
answered
what
offer
have
i
made
you
a
very
friendly
offer
but
the
penalty
of
being
in
the
secret
of
our
sciences
is
that
we
may
not
die
except
in
the
service
of
the
cause
therefore
my
friend
your
goodwill
fell
on
barren
ground
for
if
you
had
succeeded
in
killing
me
my
obligation
would
have
been
held
to
pass
to
you
and
you
would
have
suffered
terribly
who
locked
the
door
on
us
just
now
i
asked
him
i
do
know
he
answered
smiling
whimsically
very
well
i
said
suppose
you
work
one
of
your
miracles
you
and
king
disappeared
a
while
ago
simply
perfectly
from
right
alongside
me
can
you
repeat
the
process
here
and
spirit
me
away
he
shook
his
head
my
friend
if
your
eyes
had
not
been
fixed
on
things
unworthy
of
consideration
such
as
an
elephant
rump
and
the
theft
of
you
would
have
seen
us
go
how
did
you
persuade
king
to
leave
me
standing
there
without
a
word
of
warning
i
demanded
how
were
you
persuaded
into
this
place
he
retorted
you
mean
you
gagged
and
bound
him
he
smiled
again
your
friend
was
weak
from
having
so
nearly
been
drowned
nevertheless
you
overestimate
my
powers
when
i
first
met
you
you
gripped
my
hand
i
answered
i
am
reckoned
a
strong
man
yet
i
could
not
shift
your
hand
a
fraction
of
an
inch
now
you
suggest
that
you
are
weaker
than
a
man
i
understand
you
of
course
you
do
that
is
because
you
do
understand
the
form
of
energy
that
i
used
on
the
first
occasion
unfortunately
i
can
only
use
it
when
arrangements
have
been
made
in
advance
it
is
as
mechanical
as
your
watch
only
a
different
kind
of
mechanics
something
in
fact
that
some
of
your
western
scientists
would
say
has
not
yet
been
invented
well
where
king
i
asked
him
upstairs
he
asked
me
to
bring
you
now
how
can
i
he
smiled
again
with
that
peculiar
whimsical
helplessness
that
contrasted
so
strangely
with
his
former
arrogance
he
who
had
looked
like
a
lion
when
we
first
encountered
him
seemed
now
to
be
a
meek
and
rather
weak
old
man
much
weaker
in
fact
than
could
be
accounted
for
by
the
red
ring
that
my
noose
had
made
on
his
neck
is
king
at
liberty
i
demanded
and
what
do
you
call
liberty
he
asked
me
blandly
as
if
he
were
really
curious
to
know
my
opinion
on
that
subject
can
he
come
and
go
without
molestation
if
he
cares
to
run
that
risk
and
is
not
caught
try
not
to
become
impatient
with
me
anger
is
impotence
explanations
that
do
not
explain
are
part
and
parcel
of
all
religions
and
most
sciences
therefore
why
lose
your
temper
your
friend
is
free
to
come
and
go
but
must
take
his
chance
of
being
caught
he
pursues
investigations
where
where
else
than
in
this
palace
listen
among
all
the
phenomena
of
nature
there
is
none
more
difficult
to
explain
than
sound
hitherto
in
that
room
we
had
seemed
shut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
completely
for
the
door
and
walls
were
so
thick
and
the
floor
so
solid
that
seemed
unable
to
penetrate
yet
now
a
noise
rather
like
sandpaper
being
chafed
together
began
to
assert
itself
so
distinctly
as
to
seem
almost
to
have
its
origin
in
the
room
in
a
way
it
resembled
the
forest
noise
when
a
breeze
stirs
the
at
night
irregular
enough
and
yet
with
a
kind
of
pulse
in
it
increasing
and
decreasing
you
recognize
that
asked
the
mahatma
i
shook
my
head
veiled
women
walking
you
mean
the
princesses
have
come
a
few
and
their
attendants
how
many
princesses
oh
not
more
than
twenty
but
each
will
bring
at
the
least
twenty
attendants
and
perhaps
a
score
of
friends
each
of
whom
in
turn
will
have
her
own
attendants
and
only
the
princesses
and
their
friends
will
enter
the
audience
hall
which
however
will
be
surrounded
by
the
attendants
whose
business
it
will
be
to
see
that
no
stranger
and
above
all
no
male
shall
see
or
overhear
and
if
they
were
to
catch
athelstan
king
up
there
that
would
be
his
last
and
least
pleasant
experience
in
this
world
that
was
easy
enough
to
believe
i
had
just
had
an
experience
of
what
those
palace
women
could
do
she
who
learned
our
secrets
will
take
care
that
none
shall
play
that
trick
on
the
mahatma
went
on
confidently
these
women
will
use
the
audience
hall
she
lent
to
us
their
plan
is
to
control
the
new
movement
in
india
and
their
strength
consists
in
secrecy
they
will
take
all
precautions
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
i
demanded
that
as
you
sit
here
now
you
are
impotent
ca
you
work
any
of
your
tricks
those
are
not
tricks
my
friend
they
are
sciences
can
your
western
scientists
perform
to
order
without
their
right
environment
and
preparations
then
you
ca
break
that
door
down
or
turn
loose
any
magnetic
force
you
speak
like
a
superstitious
fool
he
retorted
calmly
the
answer
is
no
that
said
i
is
all
that
i
was
driving
at
do
you
see
this
and
i
held
my
right
fist
sufficiently
close
to
his
nose
to
call
urgent
attention
to
it
tell
me
just
what
transpired
between
you
and
king
from
the
time
when
you
disappeared
out
there
in
the
courtyard
until
you
came
in
here
alone
no
beating
in
the
world
could
make
me
say
a
word
he
answered
calmly
you
would
only
feel
horribly
ashamed
i
believed
him
and
sat
still
he
looking
at
me
in
a
sort
of
way
in
which
a
connoisseur
studies
a
picture
with
his
eyelids
a
little
lowered
nevertheless
he
went
on
presently
i
observe
that
i
have
misjudged
you
in
some
respects
you
are
a
man
of
violent
temper
which
is
foolishness
yet
you
have
prevailing
judgment
which
is
the
beginning
of
civilization
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
tell
you
what
you
desire
to
know
even
though
it
will
do
you
no
good
i
listen
i
answered
trying
to
achieve
that
air
of
humility
with
which
listen
to
their
that
was
partly
because
i
really
respected
the
man
in
a
way
and
partly
because
there
was
small
harm
in
flattering
him
a
little
if
that
could
induce
him
to
tell
me
the
more
know
then
he
began
that
it
was
my
fault
that
the
princess
yasmini
was
able
to
play
that
trick
on
us
it
was
to
me
that
she
first
made
the
proposal
that
we
should
use
her
audience
hall
for
our
conference
it
was
i
who
conveyed
that
proposal
to
those
whom
it
concerned
and
i
who
persuaded
them
it
was
through
my
lack
of
diligence
that
the
was
overlooked
in
which
she
and
certain
of
her
women
lay
concealed
so
that
they
overheard
some
of
our
secrets
for
that
i
should
have
been
condemned
to
death
at
once
and
it
would
have
been
better
if
that
had
been
done
yet
for
fifty
years
i
have
been
a
man
of
honor
and
although
it
is
one
of
our
chief
requirements
that
we
lay
aside
such
foolishness
as
sentiment
nevertheless
the
seeds
of
sentiment
remained
and
those
men
were
loath
to
enforce
the
penalty
on
me
who
had
taught
so
many
of
them
so
they
compromised
which
is
inevitably
fatal
for
compromise
bears
within
itself
the
roots
of
right
and
wrong
so
that
whatever
good
may
come
of
it
must
nevertheless
be
ruined
by
inherent
evil
i
bade
them
use
me
for
their
studies
and
have
done
with
compromise
but
being
at
fault
my
authority
was
gone
so
they
had
their
way
they
imposed
on
me
the
task
of
making
use
of
the
princess
yasmini
and
of
employing
her
by
some
means
to
make
a
beginning
of
the
liberation
of
india
and
she
sought
to
make
use
of
me
to
get
athelstan
king
into
her
clutches
moreover
believing
that
her
influence
over
us
was
now
too
great
to
be
resisted
she
demanded
that
athelstan
king
and
yourself
should
be
shown
sciences
and
i
consented
believing
that
thereby
your
friend
might
be
convinced
and
would
agree
to
go
to
the
united
states
to
shape
public
opinion
thereafter
you
know
what
happened
you
know
also
that
because
the
seeds
of
compromise
were
inherent
in
the
plan
my
purpose
failed
instead
of
consenting
to
go
to
the
united
states
athelstan
king
insisted
on
learning
our
sciences
you
and
he
escaped
by
a
dive
from
the
upper
window
of
this
palace
that
would
not
have
disgraced
two
and
although
you
never
guessed
it
by
that
dive
you
sentenced
me
to
death
for
i
had
to
report
your
escape
to
those
whom
it
most
concerned
and
at
once
it
was
obvious
to
them
that
you
were
certain
to
tell
what
you
had
seen
nevertheless
there
was
one
chance
remaining
that
you
might
both
be
drowned
and
one
chance
that
you
might
be
recaptured
before
you
could
tell
any
one
what
you
had
seen
and
there
was
a
third
chance
that
if
you
should
be
recaptured
you
might
be
persuaded
to
promise
never
to
reveal
what
little
of
our
secrets
you
already
know
in
that
case
your
lives
might
be
spared
although
not
mine
so
it
was
laid
upon
me
to
discover
where
you
were
and
to
bring
you
back
if
possible
and
on
the
polished
table
in
that
cave
in
which
you
saw
benares
and
bombay
and
london
and
new
york
i
watched
you
swim
down
the
river
until
you
were
rescued
by
the
elephants
so
then
i
went
to
meet
you
and
bring
you
back
what
if
we
had
refused
that
elephant
you
rode
hah
one
word
from
me
and
the
mob
would
have
blamed
you
for
the
damage
they
would
have
pulled
you
from
the
elephant
and
beaten
you
to
death
such
processes
are
very
simple
to
any
one
who
understands
just
a
word
just
a
hint
and
the
rest
is
inevitable
but
you
say
you
are
under
sentence
of
death
what
if
you
should
refuse
to
obey
them
why
refuse
what
good
would
that
do
but
you
were
at
liberty
why
not
run
away
whither
besides
should
i
who
have
enforced
the
penalty
of
death
on
so
many
fools
disloyal
ones
and
fanatics
reject
it
for
myself
when
i
myself
have
failed
there
is
nothing
unpleasant
about
death
my
friend
although
the
manner
of
it
may
be
terrible
but
even
torture
is
soon
over
and
the
sting
is
gone
from
torture
when
the
victim
knows
that
the
cause
of
science
is
thereby
being
advanced
they
will
learn
from
my
agonies
suit
yourself
i
urged
him
each
to
his
own
amusement
what
happened
after
i
turned
to
watch
the
elephant
at
the
gate
those
on
whom
the
keeping
of
our
secret
rests
considered
that
none
would
believe
you
even
if
you
were
to
tell
what
you
have
seen
but
athelstan
king
is
different
for
many
years
the
indian
government
has
accepted
his
bare
word
moreover
we
knew
that
we
can
also
accept
his
word
he
is
a
man
whose
promises
are
as
good
as
money
as
the
saying
is
so
after
you
turned
aside
to
watch
an
elephant
those
who
were
watching
us
opened
a
hidden
door
and
athelstan
king
was
made
prisoner
from
behind
they
carried
him
bound
and
gagged
into
a
cavern
such
as
those
you
visited
and
there
he
was
confronted
by
the
nine
unknown
who
asked
him
whether
or
not
he
will
promise
never
to
reveal
what
he
had
seen
the
mahatma
paused
did
he
promise
i
asked
him
he
refused
what
was
more
he
dared
them
to
make
away
with
him
saying
that
the
mahout
who
had
accompanied
us
hither
would
already
have
informed
the
maharajah
jihanbihar
who
would
certainly
report
to
the
government
and
i
standing
beside
him
confirmed
his
statement
you
seem
to
have
acted
as
prosecuting
attorney
against
yourself
i
said
no
i
simply
told
the
truth
he
answered
we
who
calculate
in
terms
of
eternity
and
infinity
have
scant
use
for
untruth
i
told
the
nine
unknown
the
exact
truth
that
this
man
athelstan
king
might
not
be
killed
because
of
the
consequences
and
that
whatever
he
might
say
to
certain
officers
of
the
government
would
be
believed
so
they
let
him
go
again
and
set
midnight
as
the
hour
of
the
beginning
of
my
death
did
king
know
that
his
refusal
to
promise
entailed
your
death
i
asked
he
shook
his
head
why
did
you
tell
him
because
it
would
not
have
been
true
my
friend
i
had
already
been
sentenced
to
death
his
promise
could
make
no
possible
difference
to
my
fate
they
let
him
go
and
ordered
me
to
present
myself
at
midnight
so
i
went
with
him
to
preserve
him
from
the
cobras
in
a
tunnel
through
which
he
must
pass
i
brought
him
into
this
palace
by
hidden
ways
and
after
i
had
shown
him
the
audience
hall
where
these
princesses
are
to
meet
he
asked
me
to
go
and
find
you
that
being
easier
for
me
than
for
him
because
none
in
this
palace
would
be
likely
to
question
me
whereas
he
would
be
detected
instantly
and
watched
even
if
not
prevented
and
when
i
had
found
you
and
you
nearly
killed
me
some
one
as
you
know
locked
the
door
and
shut
us
in
here
together
it
is
all
one
to
me
he
added
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
i
have
only
until
midnight
at
any
event
and
it
makes
small
difference
where
i
spend
the
intervening
hours
perhaps
you
would
like
to
sleep
a
little
why
not
sleep
and
i
will
keep
watch
but
badly
though
i
needed
sleep
that
sort
of
did
not
quite
appeal
besides
gentle
and
honest
and
plausible
though
the
gray
mahatma
now
seemed
there
was
still
something
within
me
that
rebelled
at
trusting
him
entirely
he
had
been
all
along
too
mysterious
and
mystery
is
what
irritates
most
of
us
more
than
anything
else
it
needs
a
man
like
athelstan
king
to
recognize
the
stark
honesty
of
such
a
man
as
that
gray
mahatma
and
athelstan
king
was
not
there
to
set
the
example
i
preferred
to
keep
awake
by
continuing
to
question
him
and
mean
that
those
devils
will
deliberately
torture
you
to
death
after
you
surrender
voluntarily
i
asked
they
are
not
devils
he
answered
solemnly
but
they
torture
you
what
is
called
torture
can
hardly
fail
to
accompany
the
process
they
will
put
me
through
especially
if
i
am
to
be
honored
as
i
hope
for
a
long
time
we
have
sought
to
make
one
experiment
for
which
no
suitable
subject
could
be
found
for
centuries
it
has
been
believed
that
a
certain
scientific
step
is
possible
but
the
subject
on
whom
the
experiment
is
tried
must
be
one
who
knows
all
our
secrets
and
well
understands
the
manipulation
of
vibrations
of
the
atmosphere
it
is
seldom
that
such
an
one
has
to
be
sentenced
to
death
and
it
is
one
of
our
laws
that
death
shall
never
be
imposed
on
any
one
not
deserving
of
it
there
are
many
myself
included
who
would
cheerfully
have
offered
ourselves
for
that
experiment
at
any
time
had
it
been
allowed
so
you
really
almost
contented
with
the
prospect
i
suggested
no
my
friend
i
am
discontented
and
for
this
reason
it
may
be
that
the
nine
unknown
who
are
obliged
by
the
oath
of
our
order
to
be
stern
and
devoid
of
sentiment
will
discover
how
pleased
i
would
be
to
submit
myself
to
that
experiment
and
in
that
case
in
place
of
that
experiment
they
would
feel
obliged
merely
to
repeat
some
test
that
i
have
seen
a
dozen
times
and
throw
your
body
to
the
alligators
afterward
in
that
case
yes
but
if
what
i
hope
takes
place
there
will
be
nothing
left
for
the
alligators
nothing
but
bones
without
moisture
in
them
that
will
seem
ten
centuries
old
chapter
xi
kill
kill
the
gray
mahatma
sat
still
contemplating
with
apparent
equanimity
his
end
that
should
begin
at
midnight
and
i
sat
contemplating
him
when
suddenly
a
new
idea
occurred
to
me
you
intend
to
surrender
to
your
executioners
at
midnight
i
asked
him
he
nodded
gravely
suppose
she
keeps
us
locked
in
here
what
then
you
say
you
ca
use
your
science
to
get
out
of
here
what
if
you
late
for
the
assignation
you
forget
he
said
with
a
deprecating
gesture
that
they
can
see
exactly
where
i
am
at
any
time
if
they
enter
the
cavern
of
vision
and
turn
on
the
power
they
can
see
us
now
instantly
they
know
perfectly
well
that
my
intention
is
to
surrender
to
them
therefore
they
will
take
care
to
make
my
escape
from
this
place
possible
five
minutes
later
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
six
women
marched
in
two
of
them
had
daggers
two
had
clubs
and
the
other
two
brought
food
and
water
it
was
pretty
good
food
and
there
was
enough
of
it
for
two
but
the
women
would
not
say
a
word
in
answer
to
my
questions
they
set
the
food
and
water
down
and
filed
out
one
by
one
the
last
one
guarding
the
retreat
of
all
the
rest
and
slipping
out
backward
pulling
the
door
shut
after
her
whereat
i
offered
the
mahatma
food
and
drink
but
he
refused
the
hot
curry
and
only
accepted
a
little
water
from
the
brass
carafe
they
will
feed
me
special
food
for
i
shall
need
my
strength
he
explained
but
the
explanation
was
hardly
satisfying
i
did
not
see
how
he
could
be
any
stronger
later
on
for
having
let
himself
grow
weaker
in
the
interval
nevertheless
i
have
often
noticed
this
that
the
east
can
train
athletes
by
methods
absolutely
opposite
to
those
imposed
by
trainers
in
the
west
and
it
may
be
that
their
asceticism
is
based
on
something
more
than
guesswork
i
ate
enormously
and
he
sat
and
watched
me
with
an
air
of
quiet
amusement
he
seemed
to
grow
more
and
more
friendly
all
the
time
and
to
forget
that
he
had
made
several
attempts
on
my
life
although
his
yellow
eyes
and
lionlike
way
of
carrying
his
head
still
gave
you
an
uncomfortable
feeling
not
of
mistrust
but
of
incomprehension
i
began
to
realize
how
accurately
king
had
summed
him
up
he
was
an
absolutely
honest
man
which
was
why
he
was
dangerous
his
standards
of
conduct
and
motives
were
utterly
different
from
ours
and
he
was
honest
enough
to
apply
them
without
compromise
or
warning
that
was
all
i
was
curious
about
his
death
sentence
and
also
anxious
to
keep
awake
so
i
questioned
him
further
asking
him
point
blank
what
kind
of
experiment
they
were
going
to
try
on
him
and
what
would
be
the
use
of
it
he
meditated
for
about
five
minutes
before
answering
is
it
within
your
knowledge
that
those
who
make
guns
seek
ever
to
make
them
powerful
enough
to
penetrate
the
thickest
armor
and
that
the
men
who
make
armor
seek
always
to
make
it
strong
enough
to
resist
the
most
powerful
guns
so
that
first
the
guns
are
stronger
and
then
the
armor
and
then
the
guns
and
then
the
armor
again
until
nations
groan
beneath
the
burden
of
extravagance
you
know
that
understand
then
that
that
is
but
imitation
of
a
higher
law
a
fragment
of
the
force
that
we
control
is
greater
than
the
whole
power
of
all
the
guns
in
the
world
and
forever
we
are
seeking
the
knowledge
of
how
to
protect
ourselves
against
it
so
that
we
may
safely
experiment
with
higher
potencies
as
we
learn
the
secret
of
safety
we
increase
the
power
and
then
learn
more
safety
and
again
increase
the
power
perpetually
there
comes
a
stage
at
which
we
dare
not
go
forward
yet
because
we
do
not
yet
know
what
the
result
of
higher
potencies
will
be
on
our
own
bodies
do
you
understand
me
so
there
will
be
an
experiment
to
ascertain
the
utmost
limit
of
our
present
ability
to
resist
the
force
you
mean
they
try
the
force
on
you
he
nodded
why
not
use
an
alligator
there
are
lots
of
creatures
that
die
harder
than
a
human
being
it
must
be
one
who
understands
he
answered
not
even
a
neophyte
would
do
it
must
be
one
of
iron
courage
who
will
resist
to
the
last
enduring
agony
rather
than
letting
in
death
that
would
instantly
end
the
agony
it
must
be
one
who
knows
the
full
extent
of
all
our
knowledge
and
can
therefore
apply
all
our
present
resources
of
resistance
so
that
the
very
outside
edge
of
safety
as
it
were
may
be
measured
accurately
and
how
long
is
the
process
likely
to
last
i
asked
him
who
knows
he
answered
possibly
three
days
or
longer
they
will
feed
me
scientifically
and
will
increase
the
potencies
gradually
in
order
to
observe
the
exact
effects
at
different
stages
and
some
of
the
more
painful
stages
they
will
repeat
again
and
again
because
the
greater
the
pain
the
greater
the
difficulty
of
registering
exact
degrees
of
resistance
the
higher
vibrations
are
not
by
any
means
always
the
most
painful
any
more
than
the
brightest
colors
or
the
highest
notes
are
always
the
most
beautiful
then
you
are
to
use
your
knowledge
of
resistance
against
their
knowledge
of
force
is
that
it
he
nodded
is
there
a
chance
then
that
you
may
hold
out
to
a
point
that
will
satisfy
them
a
point
i
mean
at
which
you
be
more
useful
to
them
alive
than
dead
surely
if
you
should
live
and
tell
them
all
about
it
that
would
serve
the
purpose
better
than
to
have
you
dead
and
silent
forever
he
smiled
like
a
school
teacher
turning
down
a
promising
suggestion
they
will
vibrate
every
atom
of
flesh
and
every
drop
of
moisture
from
my
bones
before
they
have
finished
he
answered
and
they
will
do
it
as
gradually
as
possible
seeking
to
ascertain
exactly
the
point
at
which
human
life
ceases
to
persist
my
part
will
be
to
retain
my
faculties
to
the
very
end
in
order
to
exercise
resistance
to
the
last
so
a
great
deal
depends
on
my
courage
it
is
possible
that
this
experiment
may
carry
science
forward
to
a
point
where
it
commences
a
new
era
for
if
we
can
learn
to
survive
the
higher
potencies
a
whole
new
realm
will
lie
before
us
awaiting
exploration
and
if
you
refuse
a
dog
death
have
they
no
use
for
mercy
surely
but
mercy
is
not
treason
it
would
be
treason
to
the
cause
to
let
me
live
i
failed
i
let
the
secret
out
i
die
that
is
the
law
if
they
let
me
live
the
next
one
who
failed
would
quote
the
precedent
and
within
a
century
or
so
a
new
law
of
compromise
would
have
crept
in
our
secrets
would
be
all
out
and
the
world
would
use
our
knowledge
to
destroy
itself
no
they
show
their
mercy
by
making
use
of
me
instead
of
merely
throwing
my
dead
carcass
to
the
alligators
if
you
will
tell
me
your
real
name
i
will
tell
them
at
johns
hopkins
about
your
death
and
perhaps
they
will
inscribe
your
record
on
some
roll
of
martyrs
i
suggested
i
think
that
idea
tempted
him
for
his
eyes
brightened
and
grew
strangely
softer
for
a
moment
he
was
about
to
speak
but
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
again
and
things
began
to
occur
that
drove
all
thought
of
johns
hopkins
from
our
minds
about
a
dozen
women
entered
this
time
they
did
not
trouble
to
tie
the
mahatma
but
they
bound
me
as
the
philistines
did
samson
and
then
threw
a
silken
bag
over
my
head
by
way
of
blindfold
the
bag
would
have
been
perfectly
effective
if
i
had
not
caught
it
in
my
teeth
as
they
drew
it
over
my
shoulders
it
did
not
take
long
to
bite
a
hole
in
it
nor
much
longer
to
move
my
head
about
until
i
had
the
hole
in
front
of
my
right
eye
after
which
i
was
able
to
see
fairly
well
where
they
were
leading
me
women
of
most
lands
are
less
generous
than
men
to
any
one
in
their
power
men
would
have
been
satisfied
to
let
me
follow
them
along
or
march
in
front
of
them
provided
i
went
fast
enough
to
suit
them
but
those
vixens
hardly
treated
me
as
human
perhaps
they
thought
that
unless
they
beat
shoved
prodded
and
kicked
me
all
the
way
along
those
corridors
and
up
the
gilded
stairs
i
might
forget
who
held
the
upper
hand
for
the
moment
but
i
think
not
i
think
it
was
simply
the
vengeance
that
the
inflicts
on
the
other
when
positions
are
reversed
when
india
women
finally
break
purdah
and
enter
politics
openly
we
shall
see
more
cruelty
and
savagery
for
that
reason
than
either
the
french
or
russian
terrors
had
to
show
i
was
bruised
and
actually
bleeding
in
a
dozen
places
when
they
hustled
me
down
a
corridor
at
last
and
crowded
me
into
a
narrow
anteroom
where
the
two
harridans
who
had
handled
me
hardest
had
the
worst
of
it
i
gave
them
what
in
elephant
stables
is
known
as
the
squeeze
crushing
them
to
right
and
left
against
projecting
walls
whereat
they
screamed
and
i
heard
the
reproving
voice
of
the
mahatma
just
behind
me
violence
is
the
folly
of
beasts
patience
and
strength
are
one
but
they
were
not
sticking
pins
into
his
ribs
and
thighs
to
humiliate
and
discourage
him
he
was
being
led
by
either
hand
and
cooed
to
softly
in
the
sort
of
way
that
members
of
the
dorcas
guild
would
treat
a
bishop
it
was
easy
enough
for
him
to
feel
magnanimous
i
managed
to
tread
hard
on
one
foot
and
to
squeeze
two
more
women
as
they
shoved
me
through
a
door
into
a
vast
audience
hall
and
the
screams
were
music
in
my
ears
i
do
see
why
a
woman
who
uses
pins
on
a
prisoner
should
be
any
more
immune
than
a
man
from
violent
retaliation
when
they
had
shut
the
door
they
stripped
the
silk
bag
off
over
my
head
and
holding
me
by
the
arms
four
on
either
side
dragged
me
to
the
middle
of
a
hall
that
was
at
least
as
large
as
carnegie
hall
in
new
york
and
two
or
three
thousand
times
as
sumptuous
i
stood
on
a
strip
of
carpet
six
feet
wide
facing
a
throne
that
faced
the
door
i
had
entered
by
the
throne
was
under
a
canopy
and
formed
the
center
of
a
horseshoe
ring
of
gilded
chairs
on
every
one
of
which
sat
a
heavily
veiled
woman
except
that
they
were
marvelously
dressed
in
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
and
so
heavily
jeweled
that
they
flashed
like
the
morning
dew
there
was
nothing
to
identify
any
of
the
women
except
one
she
was
yasmini
and
she
sat
on
the
throne
in
the
center
unveiled
unjeweled
and
content
to
outshine
all
of
them
without
any
kind
of
artificial
aid
she
sat
under
a
hard
white
light
directed
from
behind
a
lattice
in
the
wall
that
would
have
exaggerated
the
slightest
imperfection
of
looks
or
manner
and
she
looked
like
a
queen
like
the
queen
you
used
to
think
of
in
the
nursery
when
your
aunt
read
stories
to
you
and
the
illustrated
sunday
supplements
had
not
yet
disillusioned
you
as
to
how
queens
wear
their
hats
she
was
titania
with
a
touch
of
diana
the
huntress
and
decidedly
something
of
athena
goddess
of
wisdom
clothed
in
flowing
cream
that
showed
the
outlines
of
her
figure
and
with
sandals
on
her
bare
feet
not
a
diamond
not
a
jewel
of
any
kind
her
hair
was
bound
up
in
the
grecian
fashion
and
shone
like
yellow
gold
surely
she
seemed
to
have
been
born
for
the
very
purpose
of
presiding
perhaps
she
was
the
only
one
who
was
at
ease
for
the
others
shifted
restlessly
behind
their
veils
and
had
that
vague
uncertain
air
that
goes
with
inexperience
although
one
woman
larger
looking
than
the
rest
and
veiled
in
embroidered
black
instead
of
colors
sat
on
a
chair
near
the
throne
with
a
rather
more
outline
there
were
more
than
a
hundred
women
in
there
all
told
yasmini
change
of
countenance
at
sight
of
my
predicament
was
instantaneous
i
do
doubt
it
was
her
fault
that
i
had
been
mistreated
on
the
way
up
for
these
women
had
seen
me
bound
by
her
orders
and
mocked
by
her
a
couple
of
hours
previously
but
now
she
saw
fit
to
seem
indignant
at
the
treatment
i
had
suffered
and
she
made
even
the
ranks
of
veiled
princesses
shudder
as
she
rose
and
stormed
at
my
captors
giving
each
word
a
sort
of
weight
shall
a
guest
of
mine
suffer
in
my
house
one
of
the
women
piped
up
with
a
complaint
against
me
i
had
trodden
on
her
foot
and
crushed
her
against
a
would
he
had
slain
you
she
retorted
take
her
away
i
will
punish
her
afterward
who
stuck
pins
into
him
speak
or
i
will
punish
all
of
you
none
owned
up
but
three
or
four
of
them
who
had
not
been
able
to
come
near
enough
to
do
me
any
damage
betrayed
the
others
so
she
ordered
all
except
four
of
them
out
of
the
room
to
await
punishment
at
her
convenience
and
then
she
proceeded
to
apologize
to
me
with
such
royal
grace
and
apparent
sincerity
that
i
wondered
whom
she
suspected
of
overhearing
her
wondering
my
eyes
wandering
i
noticed
the
woman
veiled
in
black
she
was
an
elderly
looking
female
rather
crouched
up
in
her
gorgeous
shawl
as
if
troubled
with
rheumatism
and
neither
her
hands
nor
her
feet
were
visible
both
being
hidden
in
the
folds
of
the
long
the
next
instant
yasmini
flew
into
a
passion
because
the
mahatma
and
i
were
kept
standing
the
mahatma
was
not
standing
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
already
squatted
on
the
floor
beside
me
the
women
brought
us
stools
but
the
mahatma
refused
his
thinking
i
might
be
less
conspicuous
sitting
than
standing
i
sat
down
on
my
stool
whereat
yasmini
began
showering
the
women
with
abuse
for
not
having
supplied
me
with
better
garments
considering
the
long
swim
the
dusty
ride
on
an
elephant
and
two
fights
with
women
during
which
they
had
been
ripped
nearly
into
rags
the
clothes
were
so
they
brought
me
a
silken
robe
that
was
woven
all
over
with
pictures
of
the
indian
gods
and
i
sat
feeling
rather
like
a
roman
with
that
gorgeous
toga
wrapped
around
me
i
might
have
been
bearing
ultimatum
to
the
amazons
supposing
those
bellicose
ladies
to
have
existed
in
rome
day
but
it
was
presently
made
exceedingly
clear
to
me
that
yasmini
and
not
i
was
deliverer
of
ultimatums
she
had
the
whole
future
of
the
world
doped
out
and
her
golden
voice
proceeded
to
herald
a
few
of
the
details
in
mellifluous
punjabi
princesses
she
began
although
doubtless
some
of
them
were
not
princesses
this
holy
and
benign
mahatma
has
been
sentenced
to
die
by
those
who
resent
his
having
trusted
women
with
royal
secrets
he
is
too
proud
to
appeal
for
mercy
too
indifferent
to
his
own
welfare
to
seek
to
avoid
the
unjust
penalty
but
there
are
others
who
are
proud
and
who
are
not
indifferent
we
women
are
too
proud
to
let
this
gray
mahatma
die
on
our
account
and
it
shall
not
be
said
of
us
that
we
consented
to
the
death
of
the
man
who
gave
us
our
first
glimpse
of
the
ancient
mysteries
i
say
the
gray
mahatma
shall
not
die
that
challenge
rang
to
the
roof
and
the
women
fluttered
and
thrilled
to
it
i
confess
that
it
thrilled
me
for
i
did
not
care
to
think
of
the
mahatma
death
having
come
rather
to
like
the
man
the
only
person
in
the
hall
who
showed
no
trace
of
the
interest
was
the
mahatma
himself
who
squatted
on
the
carpet
close
beside
me
as
stolid
and
motionless
as
a
bronze
idol
with
his
yellow
lion
eyes
fixed
on
yasmini
straight
ahead
of
him
these
men
who
think
themselves
omnipotent
who
own
the
secret
of
the
royal
sciences
yasmini
went
on
are
no
less
human
than
the
rest
of
us
if
i
alone
had
learned
the
key
to
their
secrets
they
might
have
made
an
end
of
me
but
there
were
others
and
they
did
not
know
how
many
others
now
there
are
more
and
not
only
women
but
men
and
not
only
men
but
known
men
men
who
are
known
to
the
government
men
whom
they
dare
not
try
to
make
away
with
it
is
true
that
if
they
should
destroy
the
gray
mahatma
none
would
inquire
for
him
for
he
left
the
world
behind
him
long
ago
and
none
knows
his
real
name
or
the
place
he
can
from
but
that
is
not
so
in
the
case
of
these
other
men
one
of
whom
sits
beside
him
now
already
maharajah
jihanbihar
has
inquired
by
telegraph
as
to
their
names
and
their
business
here
and
the
government
agents
will
be
here
within
a
day
or
two
those
two
white
men
must
be
accounted
for
let
them
then
account
to
us
for
the
gray
mahatma
life
i
glanced
sideways
at
the
gray
mahatma
he
seemed
perfectly
indifferent
he
was
not
even
interested
in
the
prospect
of
reprieve
i
think
his
thoughts
were
miles
away
although
his
eyes
stared
straight
ahead
at
yasmini
but
he
was
interested
in
something
and
i
received
the
impression
that
he
was
waiting
for
that
something
to
happen
his
attitude
was
almost
that
of
a
telegraphist
listening
for
sounds
that
have
a
meaning
for
him
but
none
for
the
common
herd
and
all
at
once
i
saw
him
nod
and
beckon
with
a
crooked
forefinger
there
was
nobody
in
that
hall
whom
he
was
beckoning
to
he
was
not
nodding
to
yasmini
i
saw
then
that
his
eyes
although
they
looked
straight
at
her
were
focused
beyond
her
for
infinity
and
there
came
to
mind
that
chamber
in
the
solid
rock
below
the
tirthankers
temple
in
which
the
granite
table
stood
on
which
whoever
knew
the
secret
could
see
anything
anywhere
i
believe
that
i
am
as
sane
as
you
who
read
this
and
i
swear
that
it
seemed
reasonable
to
me
at
that
moment
that
the
gray
mahatma
knew
he
was
visible
to
watchers
in
that
cavern
and
that
he
was
signaling
to
them
to
come
and
rescue
him
from
life
for
the
appointed
death
but
yasmini
seemed
not
to
have
noticed
any
signaling
and
if
she
did
she
certainly
ignored
it
perhaps
she
believed
that
her
hornet
nest
of
women
could
stand
off
any
invasion
or
interference
from
without
at
any
rate
she
went
on
unfolding
her
instructions
to
destiny
with
perfectly
sublime
assurance
it
is
only
we
women
who
can
arouse
india
from
the
dream
of
the
it
is
only
in
a
free
india
that
the
royal
sciences
can
ever
be
stripped
of
their
mystery
india
is
chained
at
present
by
opinions
therefore
opinions
must
be
burst
or
melted
melting
is
easier
it
is
hearts
that
melt
opinions
let
these
men
therefore
take
this
gray
mahatma
with
them
to
the
united
states
and
let
them
melt
opinions
there
let
them
answer
to
us
for
the
mahatma
life
and
to
us
for
the
work
they
do
yonder
and
lest
they
feel
that
they
have
been
imposed
upon
that
they
are
beggars
sent
to
beg
in
behalf
of
beggars
let
us
pay
them
royally
lo
there
sits
one
of
these
men
beside
the
gray
mahatma
i
invite
you
royal
women
to
provide
him
with
the
wherewithal
for
that
campaign
to
which
we
have
appointed
him
and
his
friend
she
herself
set
the
example
by
throwing
a
purse
at
me
a
leather
wallet
stuffed
full
of
english
banknotes
and
the
others
had
all
evidently
come
prepared
for
the
room
rained
money
for
about
two
minutes
purses
fell
on
the
mahatma
and
on
me
in
such
profusion
that
surely
midas
never
felt
more
opulent
although
the
mahatma
took
no
notice
of
them
even
when
one
hit
him
in
the
face
there
were
all
kinds
of
purses
stuffed
with
all
kinds
of
money
but
mostly
paper
money
some
however
had
gold
in
them
for
i
heard
the
gold
jingle
and
the
darned
things
hurt
you
when
they
landed
like
a
rock
on
some
part
of
your
defenseless
anatomy
take
them
on
the
whole
those
women
made
straight
shooting
but
not
even
curiosity
was
strong
enough
to
make
me
pick
up
one
purse
and
count
its
contents
i
rose
and
bowed
acknowledgment
without
intending
to
commit
myself
and
without
touching
any
of
the
purses
which
would
have
been
instantly
interpreted
as
signifying
acceptance
but
i
sat
down
again
pretty
promptly
for
i
had
no
sooner
got
to
my
feet
than
the
woman
in
black
got
up
too
and
throwing
aside
the
embroidered
disclosed
none
other
than
athelstan
king
looking
from
lack
of
sleep
and
rather
weak
from
all
he
had
gone
through
but
humorously
determined
nevertheless
yasmini
laughed
aloud
evidently
she
was
in
the
secret
but
nobody
else
had
known
as
the
flutter
of
excitement
proved
i
think
most
of
the
women
were
rather
deliciously
scandalized
although
some
of
them
were
so
imbued
with
ancient
prejudices
that
they
drew
their
own
veils
all
the
closer
and
seemed
to
be
trying
to
hide
behind
one
another
in
fact
any
one
interested
in
discovering
which
were
the
progressives
and
which
the
reactionaries
in
that
assembly
could
have
made
a
good
guess
in
that
minute
although
it
might
not
have
done
him
much
good
unless
he
had
a
good
memory
for
the
colors
and
patterns
of
a
woman
veiled
in
the
indian
fashion
is
not
easy
to
identify
but
before
they
could
make
up
their
minds
whether
to
resent
or
applaud
the
trick
that
king
had
played
on
them
with
yasmini
obvious
collaboration
king
was
well
under
way
with
a
speech
that
held
them
spellbound
it
would
have
held
any
audience
spellbound
by
its
sheer
stark
manliness
it
was
straighter
from
the
shoulder
than
eloquence
and
left
absolutely
nothing
to
imagination
blunt
honest
downrightness
that
was
the
key
of
it
and
it
took
away
the
breath
of
all
those
women
used
to
the
devious
necessities
of
purdah
politics
my
friend
and
i
refuse
he
said
and
paused
to
let
them
understand
that
thoroughly
we
refuse
to
accept
your
money
yasmini
who
prided
herself
on
her
instantly
ready
wit
was
too
astonished
to
retort
or
to
try
to
stop
him
it
was
clear
at
a
glance
that
she
and
king
had
had
some
sort
of
conference
while
the
mahatma
and
i
were
locked
up
together
and
she
had
evidently
expected
king
to
fall
in
line
and
accept
the
trust
imposed
on
him
even
now
she
seemed
to
think
that
he
might
be
coming
at
concession
in
his
own
way
for
her
face
had
a
look
of
expectancy
but
king
had
nothing
in
his
bag
of
surprises
except
disillusion
you
see
he
went
on
we
can
no
longer
be
compelled
we
might
be
killed
but
that
would
bring
prompt
punishment
maharajah
jihanbihar
has
already
started
inquiries
about
us
by
telegraph
which
as
you
know
goes
swiftly
we
or
else
our
slayers
will
have
to
be
produced
alive
presently
so
we
refuse
to
accept
orders
or
money
from
any
one
but
as
for
the
mahatma
we
accord
him
our
protection
there
is
only
one
power
we
recognize
as
able
to
impose
death
penalties
we
repudiate
all
usurpation
of
that
power
if
the
mahatma
thinks
it
will
be
safer
in
the
united
states
my
friend
and
i
will
see
that
he
gets
there
at
our
expense
it
was
in
my
mind
he
went
on
to
drive
a
hard
bargain
with
the
mahatma
i
was
going
to
offer
him
protection
in
return
for
knowledge
but
it
is
not
fair
to
drive
bargains
with
a
man
so
closely
beset
as
he
is
therefore
i
offer
him
protection
without
terms
with
that
he
tossed
the
black
aside
and
strode
down
the
narrow
carpet
to
where
the
mahatma
sat
beside
me
giving
yasmini
a
mere
nod
of
courtesy
as
he
turned
his
back
on
her
and
until
king
reached
us
the
mahatma
squatted
there
beckoning
one
crooked
forefinger
like
a
man
trying
to
coax
a
snake
out
of
its
hole
king
stood
there
smiling
and
looked
down
into
his
eyes
which
suddenly
lost
their
look
of
staring
into
infinity
he
recognized
king
and
actually
smiled
well
spoken
he
said
rather
patronizingly
you
are
brave
and
honest
your
government
is
helpless
but
you
and
your
friend
shall
live
because
of
that
offer
you
just
made
to
me
yasmini
was
collecting
eyes
behind
king
back
and
it
needed
no
expert
to
know
that
a
hurricane
was
cooking
but
king
who
knew
her
temper
well
and
must
have
been
perfectly
aware
of
danger
went
on
talking
calmly
to
the
mahatma
you
reprieved
too
my
friend
the
mahatma
shook
his
head
your
government
is
powerless
listen
at
that
moment
i
thought
he
intended
us
to
listen
to
yasmini
who
was
giving
orders
to
about
a
dozen
women
who
had
entered
the
hall
through
a
door
behind
the
throne
but
as
i
tried
to
catch
the
purport
of
her
orders
i
heard
another
sound
that
however
distant
is
as
perfectly
unmistakable
as
the
boom
of
a
bell
for
instance
or
any
other
that
conveys
its
instant
message
to
the
mind
if
you
have
ever
heard
the
roar
of
a
mob
never
mind
what
mob
or
where
or
which
language
it
roared
in
you
will
never
again
mistake
that
sound
for
anything
else
they
have
told
the
people
said
the
mahatma
now
the
people
will
tear
the
palace
down
unless
i
am
released
thus
i
go
free
to
my
assignation
we
were
not
the
only
ones
who
recognized
that
tumult
yasmini
was
almost
the
first
to
be
aware
of
it
and
a
second
after
her
ears
had
caught
the
sound
women
came
running
in
with
word
from
ismail
that
a
mob
was
thundering
at
the
gate
demanding
the
mahatma
a
second
after
that
the
news
had
spread
all
through
the
hall
and
although
there
was
no
panic
there
was
perfectly
unanimous
decision
what
to
do
the
mob
wanted
the
mahatma
let
it
have
him
they
clamored
to
have
the
mahatma
driven
forth
king
turned
and
faced
yasmini
again
at
last
and
their
eyes
met
down
the
length
of
that
long
carpet
he
smiled
and
she
laughed
back
at
him
nevertheless
said
the
mahatma
laying
a
hand
on
king
shoulder
and
reaching
for
me
with
his
other
hand
she
is
no
more
to
be
trusted
than
the
lull
of
the
typhoon
come
with
me
and
with
an
arm
about
each
of
us
he
started
to
lead
the
way
out
through
the
maze
of
corridors
and
halls
he
was
right
she
was
not
to
be
trusted
she
had
laughed
at
king
but
the
laugh
hid
desperation
and
before
we
reached
the
door
of
the
audience
hall
at
least
a
score
of
women
pounced
on
king
and
me
to
drag
us
away
from
the
mahatma
and
make
us
prisoners
again
and
at
that
the
mahatma
showed
a
new
phase
of
his
extraordinary
character
i
was
well
weary
by
that
time
of
being
mauled
by
women
suddenly
the
mahatma
seized
my
arm
and
gave
tongue
in
a
resounding
strange
metallic
voice
such
as
i
never
heard
before
it
brought
the
whole
surging
assembly
to
rigid
attention
it
was
a
note
of
command
alarm
announcement
challenge
and
it
carried
in
its
sharp
reverberations
something
of
the
solemnity
of
an
opening
salvo
of
big
guns
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
i
go
these
two
come
with
me
shall
i
wait
and
let
the
mob
come
in
to
fetch
me
forth
but
yasmini
had
had
time
now
in
which
to
recover
her
and
she
was
in
no
mood
to
be
by
any
man
whom
she
had
once
tricked
so
badly
as
to
win
his
secrets
from
him
her
ringing
laugh
was
an
answering
challenge
as
she
stood
with
one
hand
holding
an
arm
of
the
throne
in
the
attitude
of
royal
arrogance
good
let
the
mob
come
i
too
can
manage
mobs
her
voice
was
as
arresting
as
his
although
hers
lacked
the
clamorous
quality
there
was
no
doubting
her
bravery
nor
her
conviction
that
she
could
deal
with
any
horde
that
might
come
surging
through
the
gates
but
she
was
not
the
only
woman
in
the
room
by
more
than
and
certainly
of
them
were
not
her
servants
but
invited
guests
whom
she
had
coaxed
from
their
purdah
strongholds
partly
by
the
lure
of
curiosity
and
partly
by
skilful
playing
on
their
aspirations
doubtless
her
own
women
knew
her
resourcefulness
and
they
might
have
lined
up
behind
her
to
resist
the
mob
but
not
those
others
they
knew
too
well
what
the
resulting
reaction
would
be
if
they
should
ever
be
defiled
by
such
surging
untouchables
as
clamored
at
the
gate
for
a
sight
of
their
beloved
mahatma
to
be
as
much
as
seen
by
those
casteless
folk
within
doors
was
such
an
outrage
as
never
would
be
forgiven
by
husbands
all
too
glad
of
an
excuse
for
clamping
tighter
yet
the
bars
of
tyranny
there
was
a
perfect
scream
of
fear
and
indignation
it
was
like
the
clamor
of
a
thousand
angry
parrots
although
there
was
worse
in
it
than
the
hideous
anger
of
any
birds
humanity
afraid
outscandals
outshames
anything
yasmini
who
would
no
more
have
feared
the
same
number
of
men
than
if
they
had
been
trained
animals
knew
well
enough
that
she
had
to
deal
now
with
something
as
ruthless
as
herself
with
all
her
determination
but
without
her
understanding
it
was
an
education
to
see
her
face
change
as
she
stood
and
eyed
those
women
first
accepting
the
challenge
because
of
her
own
indomitable
spirit
then
realizing
that
they
could
not
be
browbeaten
into
bravery
as
men
often
can
be
but
that
they
must
be
yielded
to
if
they
were
not
to
stampede
from
under
her
hand
she
stood
there
reading
them
as
a
man
might
read
the
posse
that
had
summoned
him
to
surrender
and
she
deliberately
chose
surrender
with
all
the
future
chances
that
entailed
rather
than
the
certain
absolute
defeat
that
was
the
alternative
but
she
carried
a
high
hand
even
while
surrendering
you
are
afraid
all
you
women
she
exclaimed
with
one
of
her
golden
laughs
well
who
shall
blame
you
this
is
too
much
to
ask
of
you
so
soon
we
will
let
the
mahatma
go
and
take
his
friends
with
him
you
may
go
she
said
nodding
regally
to
us
three
but
that
was
not
enough
for
some
of
them
the
with
her
cubs
in
springtime
is
a
mild
creature
compared
to
a
woman
whose
ancient
prejudices
have
been
interfered
with
and
a
typhoon
is
more
reasonable
of
them
screamed
that
two
of
us
were
white
men
who
had
trespassed
within
the
purdah
and
that
we
should
be
killed
come
urged
the
mahatma
tugging
at
king
and
me
we
went
out
of
that
hall
at
a
dead
run
with
screams
of
kill
them
kill
them
kill
them
shrilling
behind
us
and
it
may
be
that
yasmini
conceded
that
point
too
or
perhaps
she
was
unable
to
prevent
for
we
heard
swift
footsteps
following
and
i
threw
off
that
fifteen
thousand
dollar
toga
in
order
to
be
able
to
run
more
swiftly
the
mahatma
seemed
to
know
that
palace
as
a
rat
knows
the
runs
among
the
and
he
took
us
down
dark
passages
and
stairs
into
the
open
with
a
speed
that
if
it
did
not
baffle
pursuit
at
any
rate
made
it
easier
for
pursuers
to
pretend
to
lose
us
yasmini
was
no
fool
she
probably
called
the
pursuit
off
we
emerged
into
the
same
courtyard
where
the
marble
stairs
descended
to
the
pool
containing
one
great
alligator
and
we
hurried
from
court
to
court
to
the
same
cage
where
the
panther
pressed
himself
against
the
bars
simultaneously
showing
fangs
at
king
and
me
and
begging
to
have
his
ears
rubbed
the
mahatma
opened
the
again
using
no
key
that
i
could
detect
although
it
was
a
padlock
that
he
unfastened
and
shoved
the
brute
to
one
side
holding
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
while
king
and
i
made
swift
tracks
for
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
cage
but
this
time
we
did
not
go
through
the
tunnel
full
of
rats
and
cobras
there
was
another
passage
on
the
same
level
with
the
courtyard
that
led
from
dark
chamber
to
chamber
until
we
emerged
at
last
through
an
opening
in
the
wall
behind
the
huge
image
of
a
god
into
the
gloom
of
the
tirthankers
temple
not
that
part
of
it
that
we
had
visited
before
but
another
section
fronting
on
the
street
and
we
could
hear
the
crowd
now
very
distinctly
egging
one
another
on
to
commit
the
unforgivable
offense
and
storm
a
woman
gates
they
were
shouting
for
the
gray
mahatma
in
chorus
it
had
grown
into
a
chant
already
and
when
a
crowd
once
turns
its
collective
yearnings
into
a
single
chant
it
is
only
a
matter
of
minutes
before
the
gates
go
down
and
blood
flows
and
all
those
outrages
occur
that
none
can
account
for
afterward
as
long
as
men
do
their
own
thinking
decency
and
are
uppermost
but
once
let
what
the
leaders
call
a
slogan
usher
in
the
and
let
the
slogan
turn
into
a
chant
and
the
gardarene
swine
become
patterns
of
conduct
that
the
wisest
crowd
in
the
world
could
improve
itself
by
imitating
think
think
for
yourselves
said
the
gray
mahatma
as
if
he
recognized
the
thoughts
that
were
occurring
to
king
and
me
then
making
a
sign
to
us
to
stay
where
we
were
he
left
us
and
strode
out
on
to
the
temple
porch
looking
down
on
the
street
that
was
choked
to
the
bursting
point
with
men
who
sweated
and
slobbered
as
they
swayed
in
time
to
the
chant
of
mahatma
o
mahatma
come
to
us
mahatma
king
and
i
could
see
them
through
the
jambs
of
the
temple
door
the
mahatma
stood
looking
down
at
them
for
about
a
minute
before
they
recognized
him
one
by
one
then
by
sixes
then
by
dozens
they
grew
aware
of
him
and
as
that
happened
they
grew
silent
until
the
whole
street
was
more
still
than
a
forest
they
held
their
breath
and
let
it
out
in
sibilant
whispers
like
the
voice
of
a
little
wind
moving
among
leaves
and
he
did
not
speak
until
they
were
almost
aburst
with
expectation
go
home
he
said
then
sternly
am
i
your
property
that
ye
break
gates
to
get
me
go
home
and
they
obeyed
him
in
sixes
in
dozens
and
at
last
in
one
great
stream
chapter
xii
the
cave
of
bones
the
gray
mahatma
stood
watching
the
crowd
until
the
last
sweating
nondescript
had
obediently
disappeared
and
then
returned
into
the
temple
to
dismiss
king
and
me
come
with
us
king
urged
him
but
he
shook
his
head
looking
more
lionlike
than
ever
for
in
his
yellow
eyes
now
there
was
a
blaze
as
of
conquest
he
carried
his
head
like
a
man
who
has
looked
fear
in
the
face
and
laughed
at
it
i
have
my
assignation
to
keep
he
said
quietly
you
mean
with
death
king
asked
him
and
he
nodded
do
be
too
sure
king
retort
was
confident
and
his
smile
was
like
the
surgeon
who
proposes
to
reassure
his
patient
in
advance
of
the
operation
but
the
mahatma
mind
was
set
on
the
end
appointed
for
him
and
there
was
neither
grief
nor
discontent
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
there
is
no
such
thing
as
being
too
sure
i
shall
use
the
telegraph
of
course
king
assured
him
if
necessary
to
save
your
life
i
shall
have
you
arrested
the
mahatma
smiled
have
you
money
he
asked
pleasantly
i
sha
need
money
i
can
send
an
official
telegram
i
meant
for
your
own
needs
said
the
mahatma
i
think
i
know
where
to
borrow
a
few
rupees
king
answered
trust
me
for
the
railway
tickets
pardon
me
my
friend
it
was
my
fault
that
your
bag
and
clothes
got
separated
from
you
you
had
money
in
the
bag
that
shall
be
adjusted
never
mind
how
much
money
let
us
see
how
much
is
here
that
seemed
a
strange
way
of
adjusting
accounts
but
there
was
logic
in
it
nevertheless
there
would
be
no
use
in
offering
us
more
than
was
available
and
as
for
himself
he
was
naked
except
for
the
saffron
smock
he
had
no
purse
nor
any
way
of
hiding
money
on
his
person
he
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
made
a
noise
exactly
like
a
bronze
bell
some
sort
of
priest
came
running
in
answer
to
the
summons
and
showed
no
surprise
when
given
peremptory
orders
in
a
language
of
which
i
did
not
understand
one
word
within
two
minutes
the
priest
was
back
again
bearing
a
tray
that
was
simply
heaped
with
money
as
if
he
had
used
the
thing
for
a
scoop
to
get
the
stuff
out
of
a
treasure
chest
there
was
all
kinds
gold
silver
paper
copper
nickel
as
if
those
strange
people
simply
threw
into
a
chest
all
that
they
received
exactly
as
they
received
it
king
took
a
note
from
the
tray
and
the
gray
mahatma
waved
the
rest
aside
the
priest
departed
and
a
moment
later
i
heard
the
clash
and
chink
of
money
falling
on
money
by
the
sound
it
fell
quite
a
distance
as
if
the
treasure
chest
were
an
open
cellar
now
said
the
gray
mahatma
placing
a
hand
on
the
shoulders
of
each
of
us
go
and
forget
it
is
not
yet
time
to
teach
the
world
our
sciences
india
is
not
yet
ripe
for
freedom
i
urged
them
to
move
too
soon
go
ye
two
and
tell
none
what
ye
have
seen
for
men
will
only
call
you
fools
and
liars
above
all
never
seek
to
learn
the
secrets
for
that
means
death
and
there
are
such
vastly
easier
deaths
he
turned
and
was
gone
in
a
moment
stepping
sidewise
into
the
shadows
we
could
not
find
him
again
although
we
hunted
until
the
temple
priests
came
and
made
it
obvious
that
they
would
prefer
our
room
to
our
company
they
did
not
exactly
threaten
us
but
refused
to
answer
questions
and
pointed
at
the
open
door
as
if
they
thought
that
was
what
we
were
looking
for
so
we
sought
the
sunlight
which
was
as
refreshing
after
the
temple
gloom
as
a
cold
bath
after
heat
and
turned
first
of
all
in
the
direction
of
mulji
singh
apothecary
hoping
to
find
that
yasmini
had
lied
or
had
been
mistaken
about
that
bag
but
mulji
singh
although
fabulously
glad
to
see
us
had
no
bag
nor
anything
to
say
about
its
disappearance
he
would
not
admit
that
we
had
left
it
there
you
have
been
where
men
go
mad
was
all
the
comment
he
would
make
do
you
understand
that
we
protect
you
against
these
people
king
insisted
for
answer
to
that
mulji
singh
hunted
about
among
the
shelves
for
a
minute
and
presently
set
down
a
little
white
paper
package
on
a
corner
of
the
table
do
you
recognize
that
he
asked
deadly
aconite
said
king
reading
the
label
can
you
protect
me
against
it
you
safe
if
you
let
it
alone
king
answered
unguardedly
that
is
a
very
wise
answer
said
mulji
singh
and
set
the
aconite
back
on
the
highest
shelf
in
the
darkest
corner
out
of
reach
so
as
we
could
get
nothing
more
out
of
mulji
singh
except
a
tonic
that
he
said
would
preserve
us
both
from
fever
we
sought
the
telegraph
office
making
as
straight
for
it
as
the
winding
streets
allowed
the
door
was
shut
with
my
ear
to
a
hole
in
the
shutters
i
could
hear
loud
snores
within
king
picked
up
a
stone
and
started
to
thunder
on
the
door
with
it
the
ensuing
din
brought
heads
to
every
upper
window
and
rows
of
other
heads
like
trophies
of
a
ghastly
hunt
began
to
decorate
the
edges
of
the
roofs
several
people
shouted
to
us
but
king
went
on
hammering
and
at
last
a
sleepy
telegraph
babu
and
of
his
black
alpaca
jacket
opened
to
us
the
wire
is
broken
he
said
and
slammed
the
door
in
our
faces
king
picked
up
the
stone
and
beat
another
tattoo
how
long
has
the
wire
been
broken
he
demanded
since
morning
who
sent
the
last
message
maharajah
jihanbihar
sahib
in
full
or
in
code
in
code
he
slammed
the
door
again
and
bolted
it
and
whether
or
not
he
really
fell
asleep
within
the
minute
he
was
giving
us
a
perfect
imitation
of
a
hog
snoring
what
was
more
the
crowd
began
to
take
its
cue
from
the
babu
and
a
broke
at
our
feet
as
a
gentle
reminder
that
we
had
the
town
permission
to
depart
without
and
in
those
shabby
muddy
torn
clothes
we
were
obviously
undesirables
so
we
made
for
the
railroad
station
where
since
we
had
money
none
could
refuse
to
sell
us
tickets
but
though
we
tried
we
could
not
send
a
telegram
from
there
either
although
king
took
the
station
babu
to
one
side
and
proved
to
him
beyond
argument
that
he
knew
the
secret
service
signs
the
babu
was
extremely
sorry
but
the
wire
was
down
the
trains
were
being
run
for
the
present
on
the
old
block
system
one
train
waiting
in
a
station
until
the
next
arrived
and
so
on
so
although
king
sent
a
long
telegram
in
code
from
a
junction
before
we
reached
lahore
nothing
had
been
done
about
it
by
the
time
we
had
changed
into
christian
clothes
at
our
hotel
and
called
on
the
head
of
the
intelligence
department
and
by
then
it
was
a
day
and
a
half
since
we
had
seen
the
gray
mahatma
the
best
part
of
another
day
was
wasted
in
consulting
and
convincing
men
on
whose
knees
the
peace
of
india
rested
they
were
naturally
nervous
about
invading
the
sacred
privacy
of
hindu
temples
and
still
more
so
of
investigating
yasmini
doings
in
that
nest
of
hers
there
were
men
among
them
who
took
no
stock
in
such
tales
as
ours
anyhow
hard
and
fast
scotch
pragmatists
who
doubted
the
sanity
of
any
man
who
spoke
seriously
of
anything
that
they
themselves
had
not
heard
seen
smelt
felt
and
tasted
also
there
was
one
man
who
had
been
jealous
of
athelstan
king
all
his
years
in
the
service
and
he
jumped
at
the
chance
of
obstructing
him
at
last
after
we
had
told
our
story
at
least
twenty
times
more
and
more
men
being
brought
in
to
listen
to
it
who
only
served
to
increase
incredulity
and
water
down
belief
king
saw
fit
to
fling
his
even
temper
to
the
winds
and
try
what
anger
could
accomplish
by
that
time
there
were
eighteen
of
us
sitting
around
a
mahogany
table
at
midnight
and
king
brought
his
fist
down
with
a
crash
that
split
the
table
and
offended
the
dignity
of
than
one
man
confound
the
lot
of
you
he
thundered
i
been
in
the
service
years
and
i
repeatedly
brought
back
scores
of
wilder
tales
than
this
but
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
been
disbelieved
not
in
the
service
now
so
here
my
ultimatum
you
take
this
matter
up
at
once
or
i
take
it
up
on
my
own
account
for
one
thing
write
a
full
account
in
all
the
papers
of
your
refusal
to
investigate
suit
yourselves
they
did
not
like
it
but
they
liked
his
alternative
less
and
there
were
two
or
three
men
in
the
room
besides
who
were
secretly
on
side
but
hardly
cared
to
betray
their
opinions
in
the
face
of
so
much
opposition
they
did
not
care
to
seem
too
credulous
it
was
they
who
suggested
with
a
air
of
concession
that
no
harm
could
be
done
by
sending
a
committee
of
investigation
to
discover
whether
it
were
true
that
living
men
were
held
for
experimental
purposes
beneath
that
tirthanker
temple
and
one
by
one
the
rest
yielded
somebody
however
imposing
the
ridiculous
proviso
that
the
brahmin
priests
must
be
consulted
first
so
what
with
one
thing
and
another
and
one
delay
and
another
and
considering
that
the
wire
had
been
repaired
and
no
less
than
thirty
brahmin
priests
were
in
the
secret
the
outcome
was
scarcely
surprising
ten
of
us
including
four
policemen
called
on
the
maharajah
jihanbihar
five
full
days
after
king
and
i
had
last
seen
the
mahatma
and
after
we
had
wasted
half
a
morning
in
pleasantries
and
jokes
about
stealing
a
ride
on
his
elephant
we
rode
in
the
maharajah
landaus
to
the
tirthanker
temple
where
a
priest
who
looked
blankly
amazed
consented
at
once
to
be
our
guide
through
the
sacred
caverns
but
he
said
they
were
no
longer
sacred
he
assured
us
they
had
not
been
used
at
all
for
centuries
and
with
a
final
word
of
caution
against
cobras
he
led
the
way
swinging
a
lantern
with
no
more
suggestion
of
anything
unusual
than
if
he
had
been
our
servant
seeing
us
home
on
a
dark
night
he
even
offered
to
take
us
through
the
cobra
tunnel
but
an
acting
deputy
high
commissioner
turned
on
a
flashlight
and
showed
those
heads
all
bobbing
in
the
dark
and
that
put
an
end
to
all
talk
of
that
venture
although
the
priest
was
as
to
his
willingness
to
go
down
there
and
said
he
was
certainly
willing
and
everybody
voted
that
deuced
remarkable
but
did
believe
the
beggar
nevertheless
he
showed
us
the
pool
of
terrors
filled
with
sacred
alligators
that
he
assured
us
were
fed
on
goats
provided
by
the
superstitious
townsfolk
he
said
that
they
were
so
tame
that
they
would
not
attack
a
man
and
offered
to
prove
it
by
walking
in
since
that
entailed
no
risk
to
the
committee
they
permitted
him
to
do
it
and
he
walked
alone
across
the
causeway
that
had
given
king
and
me
such
trouble
a
few
nights
before
far
from
attacking
him
the
alligators
turned
their
backs
and
swam
away
the
committee
waxed
scornful
and
made
numbers
of
jokes
about
king
and
me
of
a
sort
that
a
man
does
listen
to
meekly
is
a
rule
so
i
urged
the
committee
to
try
the
same
trick
and
they
all
refused
then
a
rather
bright
notion
occurred
to
me
and
i
stepped
in
myself
treading
gingerly
along
the
underwater
causeway
and
i
was
hardly
in
the
water
before
the
brutes
all
turned
and
came
hurrying
back
which
took
a
little
of
the
steam
out
of
that
committee
of
investigation
they
became
less
free
with
their
opinions
so
we
all
walked
around
the
alligator
pool
by
a
passage
that
the
priest
showed
us
and
one
by
one
we
entered
all
the
caves
in
which
king
and
i
had
seen
the
fakirs
and
the
victims
undergoing
torture
the
caves
were
the
same
except
that
they
were
cleaner
and
the
ashes
had
all
been
washed
away
there
was
nobody
in
them
not
one
soul
nor
even
a
sign
to
betray
that
any
one
had
been
there
for
a
thousand
years
there
were
the
same
cells
surrounding
the
cavern
in
which
the
old
fellow
had
sat
reading
from
a
roll
of
manuscript
but
the
cells
were
absolutely
empty
i
suggested
taking
flashlight
photographs
and
fingerprint
impressions
of
the
doors
and
walls
but
nobody
had
any
magnesium
and
the
policemen
said
the
doors
might
have
been
scrubbed
in
any
case
so
what
was
the
use
and
the
priest
with
the
lantern
sneered
and
the
others
laughed
with
him
so
that
king
and
i
were
made
to
look
foolish
once
more
then
we
all
went
up
to
the
temple
courtyard
and
descended
the
stairs
through
the
hole
in
the
floor
of
the
stone
platform
and
there
stood
the
lingam
on
its
altar
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
there
were
the
doors
just
as
we
had
left
them
looking
as
if
they
had
been
pressed
into
the
molten
stone
by
an
enormous
thumb
i
thought
we
were
going
to
be
able
to
prove
something
of
our
story
at
last
but
not
so
the
priest
opened
the
first
door
by
kicking
on
it
with
his
toe
and
one
by
one
we
filed
along
the
narrow
passage
in
pitch
darkness
that
was
broken
only
by
the
swinging
lantern
carried
by
the
man
in
front
and
the
occasional
flashes
of
an
electric
torch
king
one
pace
ahead
of
me
swore
to
himself
savagely
all
the
way
and
although
i
did
not
feel
as
keenly
as
he
did
about
it
because
it
meant
a
lot
less
to
me
what
the
committee
might
think
i
surely
did
sympathize
with
him
if
we
had
come
sooner
it
was
beyond
belief
that
we
should
not
have
caught
those
experts
at
their
business
or
at
any
rate
in
process
of
removing
the
tools
of
their
strange
trade
there
must
have
been
some
mechanism
connected
with
their
golden
light
for
instance
but
we
could
discover
neither
light
nor
any
trace
of
the
means
of
making
it
naturally
the
committee
refused
to
believe
that
there
had
ever
been
any
the
caverns
were
there
just
as
we
had
seen
them
only
without
their
contents
the
granite
table
on
which
we
had
seen
benares
london
and
new
york
was
gone
the
boxes
and
rolls
of
manuscript
had
vanished
from
the
cavern
in
which
the
little
man
had
changed
lead
into
gold
before
our
eyes
the
pit
in
the
center
of
the
cavern
in
which
the
had
performed
still
held
ashes
but
the
ashes
were
cold
and
had
either
been
slaked
with
water
or
else
water
had
been
admitted
into
the
pit
from
below
at
any
rate
the
pit
was
flooded
and
nobody
wanted
the
job
of
wading
into
it
to
look
for
apparatus
so
there
may
have
been
paraphernalia
hidden
under
those
ashes
for
aught
that
i
know
it
was
a
perfectly
ridiculous
investigation
its
findings
were
not
worth
a
moment
attention
of
any
genuine
scientist
subsequently
newspaper
editors
wrote
glibly
of
the
gullibility
of
the
human
mind
with
name
and
mine
in
letters
in
the
middle
of
the
article
about
the
only
circumstance
that
the
investigating
committee
could
not
make
jokes
about
was
the
cleanliness
of
all
the
passages
and
chambers
there
was
no
dust
no
dirt
anywhere
you
could
have
eaten
off
the
floor
and
there
was
no
way
of
explaining
how
the
dust
of
ages
had
not
accumulated
unless
those
caverns
had
been
occupied
and
thoroughly
cleaned
within
a
short
space
of
time
the
air
down
there
was
getting
foul
already
there
was
no
trace
of
the
ventilation
that
had
been
so
obvious
when
king
and
i
were
there
before
nevertheless
no
trace
could
be
found
of
any
ventilating
shaft
and
that
was
another
puzzle
how
to
account
for
the
cleanliness
and
lack
of
air
combined
added
to
the
fact
that
such
air
as
there
was
was
still
too
fresh
to
be
centuries
old
one
fat
fool
on
the
committee
wiped
the
sweat
from
the
back
of
his
neck
in
the
lantern
light
and
proposed
at
last
that
the
committee
should
find
that
king
and
i
had
been
the
victims
of
delusion
perhaps
of
hypnotism
i
asked
him
point
blank
what
he
knew
about
hypnotism
he
tried
to
the
question
but
i
pinned
him
down
to
it
and
he
had
to
confess
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
whatever
whereat
i
asked
each
member
of
the
committee
whether
or
not
he
could
diagnose
hypnotism
and
they
all
had
to
plead
ignorance
so
nobody
seconded
that
motion
king
had
lapsed
into
a
sort
of
speechless
rage
he
had
long
been
used
to
having
his
bare
word
accepted
on
any
point
whatever
having
labored
all
his
military
years
to
just
that
end
craving
that
integrity
of
vision
and
perception
that
is
so
vastly
more
than
honesty
alone
that
the
blatant
unbelief
of
these
opinionative
asses
overwhelmed
him
for
the
moment
there
was
not
one
man
on
the
committee
who
had
ever
done
anything
more
dangerous
than
shooting
snipe
nor
one
who
had
seen
anything
more
inexplicable
than
spots
before
his
eyes
after
too
much
dinner
yet
they
mocked
king
and
me
in
a
sort
of
way
that
monkeys
in
the
mock
a
tiger
their
remarks
were
on
a
par
with
those
the
must
have
used
when
some
one
came
from
over
the
and
told
them
that
fire
could
be
made
by
rubbing
bits
of
wood
together
they
recalled
to
us
what
the
gray
mahatma
had
said
about
galileo
trying
to
make
the
pope
believe
that
the
earth
moved
around
the
sun
the
pope
threatened
to
burn
galileo
for
heresy
they
only
offered
to
pillory
us
with
public
ridicule
so
the
world
has
gone
forward
a
little
bit
let
go
said
somebody
at
last
i
had
enough
of
this
trespassing
as
well
as
heaping
indignity
on
estimable
hindus
go
retorted
king
i
wish
you
would
leave
ramsden
and
me
alone
in
here
there
a
cavern
we
have
seen
yet
you
formed
your
opinions
go
and
publish
them
they
interest
your
friends
he
produced
a
flashlight
of
his
own
and
led
the
way
along
the
passage
i
following
the
committee
hesitated
and
then
one
by
one
came
after
us
more
anxious
i
think
to
complete
the
fiasco
than
to
unearth
facts
but
the
door
that
king
tried
to
open
would
not
yield
it
was
the
only
door
in
all
those
caverns
that
had
refused
to
swing
open
at
the
first
touch
and
this
one
was
fastened
so
rigidly
that
it
might
have
been
one
with
the
frame
for
all
the
movement
our
blows
on
it
produced
our
guide
swore
he
did
not
know
the
secret
of
it
and
our
letter
of
authority
included
no
permission
to
break
down
doors
or
destroy
property
in
any
way
at
all
it
looked
as
though
we
were
blocked
and
the
committee
were
all
for
the
air
and
leaving
that
door
unopened
king
urged
them
to
go
and
leave
it
told
them
flatly
that
neither
they
nor
the
world
would
be
any
wiser
for
anything
whatever
that
they
might
do
was
as
beastly
rude
in
fact
as
he
knew
how
to
be
with
the
result
that
they
set
their
minds
on
seeing
it
through
for
fear
lest
we
should
find
something
after
all
that
would
serve
for
an
argument
against
their
criticism
neither
king
nor
i
were
worried
by
the
letter
of
the
committee
orders
and
i
went
to
look
for
a
rock
to
break
the
door
down
with
they
objected
of
course
and
so
did
the
priest
but
i
told
them
they
might
blame
the
violence
on
me
and
furthermore
suggested
that
if
they
supposed
they
were
able
to
prevent
me
they
might
try
whereat
the
priest
did
discover
a
way
of
opening
the
door
and
that
was
the
only
action
in
the
least
resembling
the
occult
that
any
of
us
saw
that
day
there
were
so
many
shadows
and
they
so
deep
that
a
knob
or
trigger
of
some
kind
might
easily
have
been
hidden
in
the
darkness
beyond
our
view
but
the
strange
part
was
that
there
was
no
bolt
to
the
door
nor
any
slot
into
which
a
bolt
could
slide
i
believe
the
door
was
held
shut
by
the
pressure
of
the
surrounding
rock
and
that
the
priest
knew
some
way
of
releasing
it
we
entered
a
bare
cavern
which
was
apparently
an
exact
cube
of
about
forty
feet
it
was
the
only
cavern
in
all
that
system
of
caverns
whose
walls
corners
roof
and
floor
were
all
exactly
smooth
it
contained
no
furniture
of
any
kind
but
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
hands
and
feet
pointing
to
the
four
corners
of
the
cavern
was
a
grown
man
skeleton
complete
to
the
last
tooth
king
had
brought
a
compass
with
him
and
if
that
was
reasonably
accurate
then
the
arms
and
legs
of
the
skeleton
were
exactly
oriented
north
south
east
and
west
there
was
an
apparent
inaccuracy
of
a
little
less
than
five
degrees
which
was
no
doubt
attributable
to
the
pocket
instrument
one
of
the
committee
members
tried
to
pick
a
bone
up
and
it
fell
to
pieces
in
his
fingers
another
man
touched
a
rib
and
that
broke
brittlely
i
picked
up
the
broken
piece
of
rib
and
held
it
in
the
rays
of
king
flashlight
you
remember
said
king
in
an
undertone
to
me
you
recall
the
gray
mahatma
words
will
be
nothing
left
for
the
alligators
there
neither
fat
nor
moisture
in
that
bone
it
like
chalk
see
he
squeezed
it
in
his
fingers
and
it
crumbled
huh
this
fellow
has
been
dead
for
centuries
said
somebody
he
have
been
a
hindu
or
they
have
burned
him
no
use
wondering
who
was
there
nothing
to
identify
him
with
no
hair
no
clothing
nothing
but
dead
bone
nothing
nothing
whatever
said
the
priest
with
a
dry
laugh
and
began
kicking
the
bones
here
and
there
all
over
the
cavern
they
crumbled
as
his
foot
struck
them
and
turned
to
dust
as
he
trod
on
them
all
except
the
teeth
as
he
kicked
the
skull
across
the
floor
the
teeth
scattered
but
king
and
i
picked
up
a
few
of
them
and
i
have
mine
yet
two
molars
and
two
incisors
belonging
to
a
man
who
to
my
mind
was
as
much
an
honest
martyr
as
any
in
fox
book
well
king
asked
one
of
the
committee
in
his
choicest
note
of
sarcasm
have
you
any
more
marvels
to
exhibit
or
shall
we
adjourn
adjourn
by
all
means
king
advised
him
we
know
it
all
eh
truly
you
know
it
all
king
answered
without
a
smile
then
speaking
sidewise
in
an
undertone
to
me
and
you
and
i
know
nothing
that
a
better
place
to
start
from
ramsden
i
do
know
how
you
feel
but
i
going
to
track
their
science
down
until
i
dead
or
master
of
it
the
very
highest
knowledge
attained
is
ignorance
compared
to
what
these
fellows
showed
us
going
to
discover
their
secret
or
break
my
neck
