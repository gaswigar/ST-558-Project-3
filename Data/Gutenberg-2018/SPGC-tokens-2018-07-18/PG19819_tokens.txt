introduction
few
poems
have
been
more
variously
designated
than
milton
himself
describes
it
simply
as
a
mask
by
others
it
has
been
criticised
and
estimated
as
a
lyrical
drama
a
drama
in
the
epic
style
a
lyric
poem
in
the
of
a
play
a
phantasy
an
allegory
a
philosophical
poem
a
suite
of
speeches
or
majestic
soliloquies
and
even
a
didactic
poem
such
variety
in
the
description
of
the
poem
is
explained
partly
by
its
complex
charm
and
interest
and
partly
by
the
desire
to
describe
it
from
that
point
of
view
which
should
best
reconcile
its
literary
form
with
what
we
know
of
the
genius
and
powers
of
its
author
those
who
like
johnson
have
blamed
it
as
a
drama
have
admired
it
as
a
series
of
lines
or
as
a
lyric
one
writer
who
has
found
that
its
characters
are
nothing
its
sentiments
tedious
its
story
uninteresting
has
nevertheless
doubted
whether
there
will
ever
be
any
similar
poem
which
gives
so
true
a
conception
of
the
capacity
and
the
dignity
of
the
mind
by
which
it
was
produced
bagehot
some
who
have
praised
it
as
an
allegory
see
in
it
a
satire
on
the
evils
both
of
the
church
and
of
the
state
while
others
regard
it
as
alluding
to
the
vices
of
the
court
alone
some
have
found
its
lyrical
parts
the
best
while
others
charmed
with
its
divine
philosophy
have
commended
those
deep
conceits
which
place
it
alongside
of
the
as
shadowing
forth
an
episode
in
the
education
of
a
noble
soul
and
as
a
poet
lesson
against
intemperance
and
impurity
but
no
one
can
refuse
to
admit
that
more
than
any
other
of
milton
shorter
poems
it
gives
us
an
insight
into
the
peculiar
genius
and
character
of
its
author
it
was
in
the
opinion
of
hallam
sufficient
to
convince
any
one
of
taste
and
feeling
that
a
great
poet
had
arisen
in
england
and
one
partly
formed
in
a
different
school
from
his
contemporaries
it
is
true
that
in
the
early
poems
we
do
not
find
the
whole
of
milton
for
he
had
yet
to
pass
through
many
years
of
trouble
and
controversy
but
in
a
special
degree
reveals
or
foreshadows
much
of
the
milton
of
whether
we
regard
its
place
in
milton
life
in
the
series
of
his
works
or
in
english
literature
as
a
whole
the
poem
is
full
of
significance
it
is
worth
while
therefore
to
consider
how
its
form
was
determined
by
the
external
circumstances
and
previous
training
of
the
poet
by
his
favourite
studies
in
poetry
philosophy
history
and
music
and
by
his
noble
theory
of
life
in
general
and
of
a
poet
life
in
particular
the
mask
was
represented
at
ludlow
castle
on
september
it
was
probably
composed
early
in
that
year
it
belongs
therefore
to
that
group
of
poems
and
written
by
milton
while
living
in
his
father
house
at
horton
near
windsor
after
having
left
the
university
of
cambridge
in
july
as
he
was
born
in
he
would
be
years
of
age
when
this
poem
was
composed
during
his
stay
at
horton
which
was
broken
only
by
a
journey
to
italy
in
he
was
chiefly
occupied
with
the
study
of
the
greek
roman
italian
and
english
literatures
each
of
which
has
left
its
impress
on
he
read
widely
and
carefully
and
it
has
been
said
that
his
great
and
original
imagination
was
almost
entirely
nourished
or
at
least
stimulated
by
books
his
residence
at
horton
was
accordingly
what
he
intended
it
to
be
and
what
his
father
wisely
and
gladly
permitted
it
to
be
a
time
of
preparation
and
ripening
for
the
work
to
which
he
had
dedicated
himself
we
are
reminded
of
his
own
words
in
and
wisdom
self
oft
seeks
to
sweet
retired
solitude
where
with
her
best
nurse
contemplation
she
plumes
her
feathers
and
lets
grow
her
wings
that
in
the
various
bustle
of
resort
were
all
and
sometimes
impaired
we
find
in
abundant
reminiscences
of
milton
study
of
the
literature
of
antiquity
it
would
not
be
too
much
to
say
that
the
literature
of
antiquity
was
to
milton
genius
what
soil
and
light
are
to
a
plant
it
nourished
it
coloured
it
developed
it
it
determined
not
merely
his
character
as
an
artist
but
it
exercised
an
influence
on
his
intellect
and
temper
scarcely
less
powerful
than
hereditary
instincts
and
contemporary
history
it
at
once
animated
and
chastened
his
imagination
it
modified
his
fancy
it
furnished
him
with
his
models
on
it
his
taste
was
formed
on
it
his
style
was
moulded
from
it
his
diction
and
his
method
derived
their
peculiarities
it
transformed
what
would
in
all
probability
have
been
the
mere
counterpart
of
caedmon
paraphrase
or
langland
vision
into
paradise
lost
and
what
would
have
been
the
mere
counterpart
of
corydon
doleful
knell
and
the
satire
of
the
three
estates
into
lycidas
and
comus
no
but
milton
has
also
told
us
that
spenser
was
his
master
and
the
full
charm
of
can
not
be
realised
without
reference
to
the
artistic
and
philosophical
spirit
of
the
author
of
the
both
poems
deal
with
the
war
between
the
body
and
the
soul
between
the
lower
and
the
higher
nature
in
an
essay
on
as
a
philosophic
poet
de
vere
says
the
perils
and
degradations
of
an
animalised
life
are
shown
under
the
allegory
of
sir
guyon
sea
voyage
with
its
successive
storms
and
whirlpools
its
of
reproach
strewn
with
wrecks
and
dead
men
bones
its
islands
its
of
unthriftihead
its
of
decay
its
and
lastly
its
of
bliss
and
the
doom
which
overtakes
it
together
with
the
deliverance
of
acrasia
victims
transformed
by
that
spells
into
beasts
still
more
powerful
is
the
allegory
of
worldly
ambition
illustrated
under
the
name
of
cave
of
mammon
the
legend
of
holiness
delineates
with
not
less
insight
those
enemies
which
wage
war
upon
the
spiritual
life
all
this
milton
had
studied
in
the
and
had
understood
it
and
like
sir
guyon
he
felt
himself
to
be
a
knight
enrolled
under
the
banner
of
parity
and
so
that
in
we
find
the
sovereign
value
of
temperance
or
what
the
greeks
called
σωφροσύνη
set
forth
no
less
clearly
than
in
spenser
poem
in
milton
mask
it
becomes
almost
identical
with
virtue
itself
the
enchantments
of
acrasia
in
her
bower
of
bliss
become
the
spells
of
comus
the
armour
of
belphoebe
becomes
the
complete
steel
of
chastity
while
the
supremacy
of
conscience
the
bounty
of
nature
and
man
ingratitude
the
unloveliness
of
mammon
and
of
excess
the
blossom
of
courtesy
oft
found
on
lowly
stalk
and
the
final
triumph
of
virtue
through
striving
and
temptation
all
are
dwelt
upon
it
is
the
mind
that
maketh
good
or
ill
that
maketh
wretch
or
happie
rich
or
poore
so
speaks
spenser
and
milton
similarly
he
that
has
light
within
his
own
clear
breast
may
sit
i
the
centre
and
enjoy
bright
day
but
he
that
hides
a
dark
soul
and
foul
thoughts
benighted
walks
under
the
sun
himself
is
his
own
dungeon
in
endeavouring
still
further
to
trace
by
means
of
verbal
or
structural
resemblances
the
sources
from
which
milton
drew
his
materials
for
critics
have
referred
to
peele
wives
to
fletcher
pastoral
faithful
of
which
charles
lamb
has
said
that
if
all
its
parts
been
in
unison
with
its
many
innocent
scenes
and
sweet
lyric
intermixtures
it
had
been
a
poem
fit
to
vie
with
or
the
to
have
been
put
into
the
hands
of
boys
and
virgins
to
have
made
matter
for
young
dreams
like
the
loves
of
hermia
and
lysander
to
ben
jonson
mask
of
reconciled
to
in
which
comus
is
the
god
of
cheer
or
the
belly
and
to
the
of
erycius
puteanus
henri
du
puy
professor
of
eloquence
at
louvain
it
is
true
that
fletcher
pastoral
was
being
acted
in
london
about
the
time
milton
was
writing
his
that
the
poem
by
the
dutch
professor
was
republished
at
oxford
in
and
that
resemblances
are
evident
between
milton
poem
and
those
named
but
professor
masson
does
well
in
warning
us
that
infinitely
too
much
has
been
made
of
such
coincidences
after
all
of
them
even
the
most
ideal
and
poetical
the
feeling
in
reading
is
that
all
here
is
different
all
peculiar
whatever
milton
borrowed
he
borrowed
as
he
says
himself
in
order
to
better
it
it
is
interesting
to
consider
the
mutual
relations
of
the
poems
written
by
milton
at
horton
everything
that
milton
wrote
is
miltonic
he
had
what
has
been
called
the
power
of
transforming
everything
into
himself
and
these
poems
are
accordingly
evidences
of
the
development
of
milton
opinions
and
of
his
secret
purpose
it
has
been
said
that
and
are
to
be
regarded
as
the
pleadings
the
decision
on
which
is
in
comus
representing
the
cavalier
and
the
puritan
element
this
is
true
only
in
a
limited
sense
it
is
true
that
the
puritan
element
in
the
horton
series
of
poems
becomes
more
patent
as
we
pass
from
the
two
lyrics
to
the
mask
of
and
from
to
the
elegy
of
just
as
in
the
corresponding
periods
of
time
the
evils
connected
with
the
reign
of
charles
and
with
laud
crusade
against
puritanism
were
becoming
more
pronounced
but
we
can
hardly
regard
milton
as
having
expressed
any
new
decision
in
the
decision
is
already
made
when
vain
deluding
joys
are
banished
in
and
loathed
melancholy
in
the
mask
is
an
expansion
and
exaltation
of
the
delights
of
the
contemplative
man
but
there
is
still
a
place
for
the
unreproved
pleasures
of
the
cheerful
man
unless
it
were
so
could
not
have
been
written
there
would
have
been
no
sunshine
holiday
for
the
rustics
and
no
victorious
dance
for
the
gentle
lady
and
her
brothers
but
in
we
realise
the
mutual
relation
of
and
we
see
their
application
to
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
the
actual
life
of
individuals
we
observe
human
nature
in
contact
with
the
hard
assays
of
life
and
subsequently
in
we
are
made
to
realise
that
this
human
nature
is
milton
own
and
to
understand
how
it
was
that
his
puritanism
which
three
years
before
had
permitted
him
to
write
a
cavalier
mask
should
three
years
after
lead
him
from
the
fresh
fields
of
poetry
into
the
barren
plains
of
controversial
prose
the
mask
was
a
favourite
form
of
entertainment
in
england
in
youth
and
had
been
so
from
the
time
of
henry
in
whose
reign
elaborate
masked
shows
introduced
from
italy
first
became
popular
but
they
seem
to
have
found
their
way
into
england
in
a
crude
form
even
earlier
and
we
read
of
court
disguisings
in
the
reign
of
edward
iii
it
is
usually
said
that
the
mask
derives
its
name
from
the
fact
that
the
actors
wore
masks
and
in
hall
chronicle
we
read
that
in
on
the
day
of
epiphany
at
night
the
king
with
eleven
others
was
disguised
after
the
manner
of
italy
called
a
mask
a
thing
not
seen
before
in
england
they
were
appareled
in
garments
long
and
broad
wrought
all
with
gold
with
and
caps
of
gold
the
truth
however
seems
to
be
that
the
use
of
a
visor
was
not
essential
in
such
entertainments
which
from
the
first
were
called
the
word
being
used
sometimes
of
the
players
and
sometimes
of
their
disguises
the
word
has
come
to
us
through
the
french
form
cognate
with
spanish
a
masquerade
or
assembly
of
maskers
otherwise
called
a
mummery
up
to
the
time
of
henry
viii
these
entertainments
were
of
the
nature
of
or
and
delighted
the
spectators
chiefly
by
the
splendour
of
the
costumes
and
machinery
employed
in
their
representation
but
afterwards
the
chief
actors
spoke
their
parts
singing
and
dancing
were
introduced
and
the
composition
of
masks
for
royal
and
other
courtly
patrons
became
an
occupation
worthy
of
a
poet
they
were
frequently
combined
with
other
forms
of
amusement
all
of
which
were
in
the
case
of
the
court
placed
under
the
management
of
a
master
of
revels
whose
official
title
was
magister
jocorum
revellorum
et
in
the
first
printed
english
tragedy
each
act
opens
with
what
is
called
a
or
mask
but
the
more
elaborate
form
of
the
mask
soon
grew
to
be
an
entertainment
complete
in
itself
and
the
demand
for
such
became
so
great
in
the
time
of
james
and
charles
that
the
history
of
these
reigns
might
almost
be
traced
in
the
succession
of
masks
then
written
ben
jonson
who
thoroughly
established
the
mask
in
english
literature
wrote
many
court
masks
and
made
them
a
vehicle
less
for
the
display
of
and
carpentry
than
for
the
expression
of
the
intellectual
and
social
life
of
his
time
his
masks
are
excelled
only
by
and
possess
in
a
high
degree
that
delicacy
in
their
songs
and
odes
which
sir
henry
wotton
found
so
ravishing
in
mask
jonson
in
his
lifetime
declared
that
next
himself
only
fletcher
and
chapman
could
write
a
mask
and
apart
from
the
compositions
of
these
writers
and
of
william
browne
temple
there
are
few
specimens
worthy
to
be
named
along
with
jonson
until
we
come
to
milton
other
were
middleton
dekker
shirley
carew
and
davenant
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
carew
for
which
lawes
composed
the
music
the
two
boys
who
afterwards
acted
in
had
juvenile
parts
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
popularity
of
the
mask
in
youth
received
a
stimulus
from
the
puritan
hatred
of
the
theatre
which
found
expression
at
that
time
and
drove
to
welcome
the
mask
as
a
protest
against
that
spirit
which
saw
nothing
but
evil
in
every
form
of
dramatic
entertainment
milton
who
enjoyed
the
theatre
both
jonson
learned
sock
and
what
ennobled
hath
the
buskined
stage
was
led
through
his
friendship
with
the
musician
lawes
to
compose
a
mask
to
celebrate
the
entry
of
the
earl
of
bridgewater
upon
his
office
of
lord
president
of
the
council
in
the
principality
of
wales
and
the
marches
of
the
same
he
had
already
written
also
at
the
request
of
lawes
a
mask
or
portion
of
a
mask
called
and
the
success
of
this
may
have
stimulated
him
to
higher
effort
the
result
was
in
which
the
mask
reached
its
highest
level
and
after
which
it
practically
faded
out
of
our
literature
milton
two
masks
and
were
written
for
members
of
the
same
noble
family
the
former
in
honour
of
the
countess
dowager
of
derby
and
the
latter
in
honour
of
john
first
earl
of
bridgewater
who
was
both
her
stepson
and
this
relation
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
earl
was
the
son
of
viscount
brackley
the
second
husband
and
had
himself
married
lady
frances
stanley
a
daughter
of
the
countess
by
her
first
husband
the
fifth
earl
of
derby
amongst
the
children
of
the
earl
of
bridgewater
were
three
who
took
important
parts
in
the
representation
of
alice
the
youngest
daughter
then
about
fourteen
years
of
age
who
appeared
as
john
viscount
brackley
who
took
the
part
of
the
and
thomas
egerton
who
appeared
as
the
we
do
not
know
who
acted
the
parts
of
and
but
the
part
of
the
was
taken
by
henry
lawes
gentleman
of
the
chapel
royal
and
one
of
his
majesty
private
musicians
the
earl
children
were
his
pupils
and
the
mask
was
naturally
produced
under
his
direction
milton
friendship
with
lawes
is
shown
by
the
sonnet
which
the
poet
addressed
to
the
musician
harry
whose
tuneful
and

in

shall
give
fame
leave
to
set
thee
higher
than
his
casella
who
he
woo
to
sing
met
in
the
milder
shades
of
purgatory
we
must
remember
also
that
it
was
to
lawes
that
milton
owed
its
first
publication
and
as
we
see
from
the
dedication
prefixed
to
the
text
that
he
was
justly
proud
of
his
share
in
its
first
representation
such
were
the
persons
who
appeared
in
milton
mask
they
are
few
in
number
and
the
plan
of
the
piece
is
correspondingly
simple
there
are
three
scenes
which
may
be
briefly
characterised
thus
i
the
tempter
and
the
tempted
lines
a
wild
wood
ii
the
temptation
and
the
rescue
lines
the
palace
of
comus
iii
the
triumph
lines
the
president
castle
in
the
first
scene
after
a
kind
of
prologue
lines
the
interest
rises
as
we
are
introduced
first
to
comus
and
his
rout
then
to
the
lady
alone
and
and
finally
to
comus
and
the
lady
in
company
at
the
same
time
the
nature
of
the
lady
trial
and
her
subsequent
victory
are
foreshadowed
in
a
conversation
between
the
brothers
and
the
attendant
spirit
this
is
one
of
the
more
miltonic
parts
of
the
mask
in
the
philosophical
reasoning
of
the
elder
brother
as
opposed
to
the
arguments
of
the
younger
we
trace
the
young
poet
fresh
from
the
study
of
the
divine
volume
of
plato
and
filled
with
a
noble
trust
in
god
in
the
second
scene
we
breathe
the
unhallowed
air
of
the
abode
of
the
wily
tempter
who
endeavours
under
fair
pretence
of
friendly
ends
to
wind
himself
into
the
pure
heart
of
the
lady
but
his
gay
rhetoric
is
futile
against
the
power
of
chastity
and
he
is
driven
off
the
scene
by
the
two
brothers
who
are
led
and
instructed
by
the
spirit
disguised
as
the
shepherd
thyrsis
but
the
lady
having
been
lured
into
the
haunt
of
impurity
is
left
and
appeal
is
made
to
the
pure
nymph
sabrina
who
is
swift
to
aid
a
virgin
such
as
was
herself
in
need
it
is
in
the
contention
between
comus
and
the
lady
in
this
scene
that
the
interest
of
the
mask
may
be
said
to
culminate
for
here
its
purpose
stands
revealed
it
is
a
song
to
temperance
as
the
ground
of
freedom
to
temperance
as
the
guard
of
all
the
virtues
to
beauty
as
secured
by
temperance
and
its
central
point
and
climax
is
in
the
pleading
of
these
motives
by
the
lady
against
their
opposites
in
the
mouth
of
the
lord
of
sensual
revel
classical
in
the
third
scene
the
lady
alice
and
her
brothers
are
presented
by
the
spirit
to
their
noble
father
and
mother
as
triumphing
in
victorious
dance
sensual
folly
and
intemperance
the
spirit
then
speaks
the
epilogue
calling
upon
mortals
who
love
true
freedom
to
strive
after
virtue
love
virtue
she
alone
is
free
she
can
teach
ye
how
to
climb
higher
than
the
sphery
chime
or
if
virtue
feeble
were
heaven
itself
would
stoop
to
her
the
last
couplet
milton
afterwards
on
his
italian
journey
entered
in
an
album
belonging
to
an
italian
named
cerdogni
and
underneath
it
the
words
non
animum
muto
dum
trans
mare
and
his
signature
joannes
miltonius
anglus
the
juxtaposition
of
these
verses
is
significant
though
he
had
left
his
own
land
milton
had
not
become
what
fifty
or
sixty
years
before
roger
ascham
had
condemned
as
an
italianated
englishman
he
was
one
of
those
worthy
gentlemen
of
england
whom
all
the
siren
tongues
of
italy
could
never
untwine
from
the
mast
of
god
word
nor
no
enchantment
of
vanity
overturn
them
from
the
fear
of
god
and
love
of
honesty
ascham
and
one
might
almost
infer
that
milton
in
his
account
of
the
sovereign
plant
haemony
which
was
to
foil
the
wiles
of
had
remembered
not
only
homer
description
of
the
root
moly
that
hermes
once
to
wise
ulysses
gave
a
but
also
ascham
remarks
thereupon
the
true
medicine
against
the
enchantments
of
circe
the
vanity
of
licentious
pleasure
the
enticements
of
all
sin
is
in
homer
the
herb
moly
with
the
black
root
and
white
flower
sour
at
first
but
sweet
in
the
end
which
hesiod
termeth
the
study
of
virtue
hard
and
irksome
in
the
beginning
but
in
the
end
easy
and
pleasant
and
that
which
is
most
to
be
marvelled
at
the
divine
poet
homer
saith
plainly
that
this
medicine
against
sin
and
vanity
is
not
found
out
by
man
but
given
and
taught
by
god
like
his
last
great
poems
is
a
poetical
expression
of
the
same
belief
his
poetical
works
the
outcome
of
his
inner
life
his
life
of
artistic
contemplation
are
in
the
words
of
dowden
various
renderings
of
one
dominant
idea
that
the
struggle
for
mastery
between
good
and
evil
is
the
prime
fact
of
life
and
that
a
final
victory
of
the
righteous
cause
is
assured
by
the
existence
of
a
divine
order
of
the
universe
which
milton
knew
by
the
name

footnotes
a
it
is
noteworthy
that
lamb
whose
allusiveness
is
remarkable
employs

his
account

of

sir
it
was
a
special
favour
when
you
lately
bestowed
upon
me
here
the
first
taste
of
your
acquaintance
though
no
longer
than
to
make
me
know
that
i
wanted
more
time
to
value
it
and
to
enjoy
it
rightly
and
in
truth
if
i
could
then
have
imagined
your
farther
stay
in
these
parts
which
i
understood
afterwards
by
i
would
have
been
bold
in
our
vulgar
phrase
to
mend
my
draught
for
you
left
me
with
an
extreme
thirst
and
to
have
begged
your
conversation
again
jointly
with
your
said
learned
friend
at
a
poor
meal
or
two
that
we
might
have
banded
together
some
good
authors
of
the
antient
time
among
which
i
observed
you
to
have
been
familiar
since
your
going
you
have
charged
me
with
new
obligations
both
for
a
very
kind
letter
from
you
dated
the
sixth
of
this
month
and
for
a
dainty
piece
of
entertainment
which
came
therewith
wherein
i
should
much
commend
the
tragical
part
if
the
lyrical
did
not
ravish
me
with
a
certain
doric
delicacy
in
your
songs
and
odes
whereunto
i
must
plainly
confess
to
have
seen
yet
nothing
parallel
in
our
language
a
but
i
must
not
omit
to
tell
you
that
i
now
only
owe
you
thanks
for
intimating
unto
me
how
modestly
soever
the
true
artificer
for
the
work
itself
i
had
viewed
some
good
while
before
with
singular
delight
having
received
it
from
our
common
friend
in
the
very
close
of
the
late
poems
printed
at
oxford
whereunto
it
is
added
as
i
now
suppose
that
the
accessory
might
help
out
the
principal
according
to
the
art
of
stationers

to
leave
the
reader

now
sir
concerning
your
travels

i
may
challenge
a
little
more
privilege
of
discourse
with
you

suppose
you
will
not
blanch

paris
in
your
way

i
have
been
bold
to
trouble
you
with
a
few
lines

whom
you
shall
easily
find
attending

young
lord

his
governor

receive
from
him
good
directions

did

my
choice
some
time
for

look

at

departure
toward

had
been

won
confidence

any
favoured
of
high
jove
chances
to
pass
through
this
adventurous
glade
swift
as
the
sparkle
of
a
glancing
star
i
shoot
from
heaven
to
give
him
safe
convoy
as
now
i
do
but
first
i
must
put
off
these
my
spun
out
of
iris
woof
and
take
the
weeds
and
likeness
of
a
swain
that
to
the
service
of
this
house
belongs
who
with
his
soft
pipe
and
song
well
knows
to
still
the
wild
winds
when
they
roar
and
hush
the
waving
woods
nor
of
less
faith
and
in
this
office
of
his
mountain
watch
likeliest
and
nearest
to
the
present
aid
of
this
occasion
but
i
hear
the
tread
of
hateful
steps
i
must
be
viewless
now
enters
with
a
in
one
hand
his
glass
in
the
other
with
him
a
rout
of
monsters
headed
like
sundry
sorts
of
wild
beasts
but
otherwise
like
men
and
women
their
apparel
glistering
they
come
in
making
a
riotous
and
unruly
noise
with
torches
in
their
the
star
that
bids
the
shepherd
fold
now
the
top
of
heaven
doth
hold
and
the
gilded
car
of
day
his
glowing
axle
doth
allay
in
the
steep
atlantic
stream
and
the
slope
sun
his
upward
beam
shoots
against
the
dusky
pole
pacing
toward
the
other
goal
of
his
chamber
in
the
east
meanwhile
welcome
joy
and
feast
midnight
shout
and
revelry
tipsy
dance
and
jollity
braid
your
locks
with
rosy
twine
dropping
odours
dropping
wine
rigour
now
is
gone
to
bed
and
advice
with
scrupulous
head
strict
age
and
sour
severity
with
their
grave
saws
in
slumber
lie
we
that
are
of
purer
fire
imitate
the
starry
quire
who
in
their
nightly
watchful
spheres
lead
in
swift
round
the
months
and
years
the
sounds
and
seas
with
all
their
finny
drove
now
to
the
moon
in
wavering
morrice
move
and
on
the
tawny
sands
and
shelves
trip
the
pert
fairies
and
the
dapper
elves
by
dimpled
brook
and
the
decked
with
daisies
trim
their
merry
wakes
and
pastimes
keep
what

with

better

now
wakes
and

love
come
let
us
our
rights
begin
is
only
daylight
that
makes
sin
which
these
dun
shades
will
report
hail
goddess
of
nocturnal
sport
cotytto
to
whom
the
secret
flame
of
midnight
torches
burns
mysterious
dame
that
art
called
but
when
the
dragon
womb
of
stygian
darkness
spets
her
thickest
gloom
and
makes
one
blot
of
all
the
air
stay
thy
cloudy
ebon
chair
wherein
thou
ridest
with
hecat
and
befriend
us
thy
vowed
priests
till
utmost
end
of
all
thy
dues
be
done
and
none
left
out
ere
the
blabbing
eastern
scout
the
nice
morn
on
the
indian
steep
from
her
cabined
peep
and
to
the
sun
descry
our
concealed
solemnity
come
knit
hands
and
beat
the
ground
in
a
light
fantastic
round
break
off
break
off
i
feel
the
different
pace
of
some
chaste
footing
near
about
this
ground
run
to
your
shrouds
within
these
brakes
and
trees
our
number
may
affright
some
virgin
sure
for
so
i
can
distinguish
by
mine
art
benighted
in
these
woods
now
to
my
charms
and
to
my
wily
trains
i
shall
ere
long
be
well
stocked
with
as
fair
a
herd
as
grazed
about
my
mother
circe
thus
i
hurl
my
dazzling
spells
into
the
spongy
air
of
power
to
cheat
the
eye
with
blear
illusion
and
give
it
false
presentments
lest
the
place
and
my
quaint
habits
breed
astonishment
and
put
the
damsel
to
suspicious
flight
which
must
not
be
for
that
against
my
course
i
under
fair
pretence
of
friendly
ends
and
words
of
glozing
courtesy
baited
with
reasons
not
unplausible
wind
me
into
the
man
and
hug
him
into
snares
when
once
her
eye
hath
met
the
virtue
of
this
magic
dust
i
shall
appear
some
harmless
villager
whom
thrift
keeps
up
about
his
country
gear
but
here
she
comes
i
fairly
step
aside
and
hearken
if
i
may
her
business
here
lady
this
way
the
noise
was
if
mine
ear
be
true
my
best
guide
now
methought
it
was
the
sound
of
riot
and
merriment
such
as
the
jocund
flute
or
gamesome
pipe
stirs
up
among
the
loose
unlettered
hinds
when
for
their
teeming
flocks
and
granges
full
in
wanton
dance
they
praise
the
bounteous
pan
and
thank
the
gods
amiss
i
should
be
loth
to
meet
the
rudeness
and
swilled
insolence
of
such
late
wassailers
yet
oh
where
else
shall
i
inform
my
unacquainted
feet
in
the
blind
mazes
of
this
tangled
wood
my
brothers
when
they
saw
me
wearied
out
with
this
long
way
resolving
here
to
lodge
under
the
spreading
favour
of
these
pines
stepped
as
they
said
to
the
next
to
bring
me
berries
or
such
cooling
fruit
as
the
kind
hospitable
woods
provide
they
left
me
then
when
the
even
like
a
sad
votarist
in
palmer
weed
rose
from
the
hindmost
wheels
of
phœbus
wain
but
where
they
are
and
why
they
came
not
back
is
now
the
labour
of
my
thoughts
is
likeliest
they
had
engaged
their
wandering
steps
too
far
and
envious
darkness
ere
they
could
return
had
stole
them
from
me
else
o
thievish
night
why
shouldst
thou
but
for
some
felonious
end
in
thy
dark
lantern
thus
close
up
the
stars
that
nature
hung
in
heaven
and
filled
their
lamps
with
everlasting
oil
to
give
due
light
to
the
misled
and
lonely
traveller
this
is
the
place
as
well
as
i
may
guess
whence
even
now
the
tumult
of
loud
mirth
was
rife
and
perfect
in
my
listening
ear
yet
nought
but
single
darkness
do
i
find
what
might
this
be
a
thousand
fantasies
begin
to
throng
into
my
memory
of
calling
shapes
and
beckoning
shadows
dire
and
airy
tongues
that
syllable
men
names
on
sands
and
shores
and
desert
wildernesses
these
thoughts
may
startle
well
but
not
astound
the
virtuous
mind
that
ever
walks
attended
by
a
strong
siding
champion
conscience
o
welcome
faith
hope
thou
hovering
angel
girt
with
golden
wings
and
thou
unblemished
form
of
chastity
i
see
ye
visibly
and
now
believe
that
he
the
supreme
good
to
whom
all
things
ill
are
but
as
slavish
officers
of
vengeance
would
send
a
glistering
guardian
if
need
were
to
keep
my
life
and
honour
unassailed
was
i
deceived
or
did
a
sable
cloud
turn
forth
her
silver
lining
on
the
night
i
did
not
err
there
does
a
sable
cloud
turn
forth
her
silver
lining
on
the
night
and
casts
a
gleam
over
this
tufted
grove
i
can
not
hallo
to
my
brothers
but
such
noise
as
i
can
make
to
be
heard
farthest
i
venture
for
my
spirits
prompt
me
and
they
perhaps
are
not
far
off
sweet
echo
sweetest
nymph
that
unseen
within
thy
airy
shell
by
slow
meander
margent
green
and
in
the
vale
where
the
nightingale
nightly
to
thee
her
sad
song
mourneth
well
canst
thou
not
tell
me
of
a
gentle
pair
that
likest
thy
narcissus
are
o
if
thou
have
hid
them
in
some
flowery
cave
tell
me
but
where
sweet
queen
of
parley
daughter
of
the
sphere
so
thou
be
translated
to
the
skies
and
give
resounding
grace
to
all
heaven
harmonies
can
any
mortal
mixture
of
earth
mould
breathe
such
divine
enchanting
ravishment
sure
something
holy
lodges
in
that
breast
and
with
these
raptures
moves
the
vocal
air
to
testify
his
hidden
residence
how
sweetly
did
they
float
upon
the
wings
of
silence
through
the
night
at
every
fall
smoothing
the
raven
down
of
darkness
till
it
smiled
i
have
oft
heard
my
mother
circe
with
the
sirens
three
amidst
the
naiades
culling
their
potent
herbs
and
baleful
drugs
who
as
they
sung
would
take
the
prisoned
soul
and
lap
it
in
elysium
scylla
wept
and
chid
her
barking
waves
into
attention
and
fell
charybdis
murmured
soft
applause
yet
they
in
pleasing
slumber
lulled
the
sense
and
in
sweet
madness
robbed
it
of
itself
but
such
a
sacred
and
delight
such
sober
certainty
of
waking
bliss
i
never
heard
till
now
i
speak
to
her
and
she
shall
be
my
hail
foreign
wonder
whom
certain
these
rough
shades
did
never
breed
unless
the
goddess
that
in
rural
shrine
here
with
pan
or
sylvan
by
blest
song
forbidding
every
bleak
unkindly
fog
to
touch
the
prosperous
growth
of
this
tall
wood
nay
gentle
shepherd
ill
is
lost
that
praise
that
is
addressed
to
unattending
ears
not
any
boast
of
skill
but
extreme
shift
how
to
regain
my
severed
company
compelled
me
to
awake
the
courteous
echo
to
give
me
answer
from
her
mossy
couch
what
chance
good
lady
hath
bereft
you
thus
dim
darkness
and
this
leafy
labyrinth
could
that
divide
you
from
guides
they
left
me
weary
on
a
grassy
turf
by
falsehood
or
discourtesy
or
why
to
seek
i
the
valley
some
cool
friendly
spring
and
left
your
fair
side
all
unguarded
lady
they
were
but
twain
and
purposed
quick
return
perhaps
forestalling
night
prevented
them
how
easy
my
misfortune
is
to
hit
imports
their
loss
beside
the
present
need
no
less
than
if
i
should
my
brothers
lose
were
they
of
manly
prime
or
youthful
bloom
as
smooth
as
hebe
their
unrazored
lips
two
such
i
saw
what
time
the
laboured
ox
in
his
loose
traces
from
the
furrow
came
and
the
swinked
hedger
at
his
supper
sat
i
saw
them
under
a
green
mantling
vine
that
crawls
along
the
side
of
yon
small
hill
plucking
ripe
clusters
from
the
tender
shoots
their
port
was
more
than
human
as
they
stood
i
took
it
for
a
faery
vision
of
some
gay
creatures
of
the
element
that
in
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
live
and
play
i
the
plighted
clouds
i
was
and
as
i
passed
i
worshiped
if
those
you
seek
it
were
a
journey
like
the
path
to
heaven
to
help
you
find
them
gentle
villager
what
readiest
way
would
bring
me
to
that
place
due
west
it
rises
from
this
shrubby
point
to
find
out
that
good
shepherd
i
suppose
in
such
a
scant
allowance
of
would
overtask
the
best
art
without
the
sure
guess
of
feet
i
know
each
lane
and
every
alley
green
dingle
or
bushy
dell
of
this
wild
wood
and
every
bosky
bourn
from
side
to
side
my
daily
walks
and
ancient
neighbourhood
and
if
your
stray
attendance
be
yet
lodged
or
shroud
within
these
limits
i
shall
know
ere
morrow
wake
or
the
lark
from
her
thatched
pallet
rouse
if
otherwise
i
can
conduct
you
lady
to
a
low
but
loyal
cottage
where
you
may
be
safe
till
further
quest
shepherd
i
take
thy
word
and
trust
thy
courtesy
which
oft
is
sooner
found
in
lowly
sheds
with
smoky
rafters
than
in
tapestry
halls
and
courts
of
princes
where
it
first
was
named
and
yet
is
most
pretended
in
a
place
less
warranted
than
this
or
less
secure
i
can
not
be
that
i
should
fear
to
change
it
eye
me
blest
providence
and
square
my
trial
to
my
proportioned
strength

on
the
two

ye
faint
stars
and
thou
fair
moon
that
to
love
the
traveller
benison
stoop
thy
pale
visage
through
an
amber
cloud
and
disinherit
chaos
that
reigns
here
in
double
night
of
darkness
and
of
shades
or
if
your
influence
be
quite
dammed
up
with
black
usurping
mists

gentle
taper

a
from
the
wicker
hole
of
some
clay
habitation

with
thy
long
levelled
rule
of
streaming
light
and
thou
shalt
be
our
star
of
arcady
or
tyrian
cynosure
or
if
our
eyes
be
barred

happiness

we
but
hear
the
folded
flocks

in

wattled
cotes

of
pastoral
reed

oaten
stops

whistle
from

to
his
feathery
dames

some
solace

some
little
cheering
in
this
close
dungeon
of
innumerous
boughs
but
oh
that
hapless
virgin
our
lost
sister
where
may
she
wander
now
whither
betake
her
from
the
chill
dew
amongst
rude
burs
and
thistles
perhaps
some
cold
bank
is
her
bolster
now
or
the
rugged
bark
of
some
broad
elm
leans
her
unpillowed
head
fraught
with
sad
fears
what
if
in
wild
amazement
and
affright
or
while
we
speak
within
the
direful
grasp
of
savage
hunger
or
of
savage
heat
peace
brother
be
not
to
cast
the
fashion
of
uncertain
evils
for
grant
they
be
so
while
they
rest
unknown
what
need
a
man
forestall
his
date
of
grief
and
run
to
meet
what
he
would
most
avoid
or
if
they
be
but
false
alarms
of
fear
how
bitter
is
such
i
do
not
think
my
sister
so
to
seek
or
so
unprincipled
in
virtue
book
and
the
sweet
peace
that
goodness
bosoms
ever
as
that
the
single
want
of
light
and
noise
not
being
in
danger
as
i
trust
she
is
not
could
stir
the
constant
mood
of
her
calm
thoughts
and
put
them
into
misbecoming
plight
virtue
could
see
to
do
what
virtue
would
by
her
own
radiant
light
though
sun
and
moon
were
in
the
flat
sea
sunk
and
wisdom
self
oft
seeks
to
sweet
retired
solitude
where
with
her
best
nurse
contemplation
she
plumes
her
feathers
and
lets
grow
her
wings
that
in
the
various
bustle
of
resort
were
all
and
sometimes
impaired
he
that
has
light
within
his
own
clear
breast
may
sit
i
the
centre
and
enjoy
bright
day
but
he
that
hides
a
dark
soul
and
foul
thoughts
benighted
walks
under
the
sun
himself
is
his
own
dungeon
is
most
true
that
musing
meditation
most
affects
the
pensive
secrecy
of
desert
cell
far
from
the
cheerful
haunt
of
men
and
herds
and
sits
as
safe
as
in
a
for
who
would
rob
a
hermit
of
his
weeds
his
few
books
or
his
beads
or
maple
dish
or
do
his
grey
hairs
any
violence
but
beauty
like
the
fair
hesperian
tree
laden
with
blooming
gold
had
need
the
guard
of
with
unenchanted
eye
to
save
her
blossoms
and
defend
her
fruit
from
the
rash
hand
of
bold
incontinence
you
may
as
well
spread
out
the
unsunned
heaps
of
miser
treasure
by
an
outlaw
den
and
tell
me
it
is
safe
as
bid
me
hope
danger
will
wink
on
opportunity
and
let
a
single
helpless
maiden
pass
uninjured
in
this
wild
surrounding
waste
of
night
or
loneliness
it
recks
me
not
i
fear
the
dread
events
that
dog
them
both
lest
some
touch
attempt
the
person
of
our
unownéd
sister
i
do
not
brother
infer
as
if
i
thought
my
sister
state
secure
without
all
doubt
or
controversy
yet
where
an
equal
poise
of
hope
and
fear
does
arbitrate
the
event
my
nature
is
that
i
incline
to
hope
rather
than
fear
and
gladly
banish
squint
suspicion
my
sister
is
not
so
defenceless
left
as
you
imagine
she
has
a
hidden
strength
which
you
remember
not
what
hidden
strength
unless
the
strength
of
heaven
if
you
mean
that
i
mean
that
too
but
yet
a
hidden
strength
which
if
heaven
gave
it
may
be
termed
her
own
is
chastity
my
brother
chastity
she
that
has
that
is
clad
in
cómplete
steel
and
like
a
quivered
nymph
with
arrows
keen
may
trace
huge
forests
and
unharboured
heaths
infámous
hills
and
sandy
perilous
wilds
where
through
the
sacred
rays
of
chastity
no
savage
fierce
bandite
or
mountaineer
will
dare
to
soil
her
virgin
purity
yea
there
where
very
desolation
dwells
by
grots
and
caverns
shagged
with
horrid
shades
she
may
pass
on
with
unblenched
majesty
be
it
not
done
in
pride
or
in
presumption
some

no

that

shall
i
call
antiquity
from
the
old
schools
of
greece
to
testify
the
arms
of
chastity
hence
had
the
huntress
dian
her
dread
bow
fair
queen
for
ever
chaste
wherewith
she
tamed
the
brinded
lioness
and
spotted
but
set
at
nought
the
frivolous
bolt
of
cupid
gods
and
men
feared
her
stern
frown
and
she
was
queen
o
the
woods
what
was
that
gorgon
shield
that
wise
minerva
wore
unconquered
virgin
wherewith
she
freezed
her
foes
to
congealed
stone
but
rigid
looks
of
chaste
austerity
and
noble
grace
that
dashed
brute
violence
with
sudden
adoration
and
blank
awe
so
dear
to
heaven
is
saintly
chastity
that
when
a
soul
is
found
sincerely
so
a
thousand
liveried
angels
lackey
her
driving
far
off
each
thing
of
sin
and
guilt
and
in
clear
dream
and
solemn
vision
tell
her
of
things
that
no
gross
ear
can
hear
till
oft
converse
with
heavenly
habitants
begin
to
cast
a
beam
on
the
outward
shape
the
unpolluted
temple
of
the
mind
and
turns
it
by
degrees
to
the
soul
essence
till
all
be
made
immortal
but
when
lust
by
unchaste
looks
loose
gestures
and
foul
talk
but
most
by
lewd
and
lavish
act
of
sin
lets
in
defilement
to
the
inward
parts
the
soul
grows
clotted
by
contagion
imbodies
and
imbrutes
till
she
quite
loose
the
divine
property
of
her
first
being
such
are
those
thick
and
gloomy
shadows
damp
oft
seen
in
and
sepulchres
lingering
and
sitting
by
a
grave
as
loth
to
leave
the
body
that
it
loved
and
linked
itself
by
carnal
sensualty
to
a
degenerate
and
degraded
state
how
charming
is
divine
philosophy
not
harsh
and
crabbed
as
dull
fools
suppose
but
musical
as
is
apollo
lute
and
a
perpetual
feast
of
nectared
sweets
where
no
crude
surfeit
reigns
list
list
i
hear
some
hallo
break
the
silent
air
methought
so
too
what
should
it
be
for
certain
either
some
one
like
us
here
or
else
some
neighbour
woodman
or
at
worst
some
roving
robber
calling
to
his
fellows
heaven
keep
my
sister
again
again
and
near
best
draw
and
stand
upon
our
guard
i
hallo
if
he
be
friendly
he
comes
well
if
not
defence
is
a
good
cause
and
heaven
be
for
us
the
attendant
spirit
habited
like
a
that
hallo
i
should
know
what
are
you
speak
come
not
too
near
you
fall
on
iron
stakes
else
what
voice
is
that
my
young
lord
speak
again
o
brother
is
my
father
shepherd
sure
thyrsis
whose
artful
strains
have
oft
delayed
the
huddling
brook
to
hear
his
madrigal
and
sweetened
every
of
the
dale
how
camest
thou
here
good
swain
hath
any
ram
slipped
from
the
fold
or
young
kid
lost
his
dam
or
straggling
wether
the
pent
flock
forsook
how
couldst
thou
find
this
dark
sequestered
nook
o
my
loved
master
heir
and
his
next
joy
i
came
not
here
on
such
a
trivial
toy
as
a
strayed
ewe
or
to
pursue
the
stealth
of
pilfering
wolf
not
all
the
fleecy
wealth
that
doth
enrich
these
downs
is
worth
a
thought
to
this
my
errand
and
the
care
it
brought
but
oh
my
virgin
lady
where
is
she
how
chance
she
is
not
in
your
company
to
tell
thee
sadly
shepherd
without
blame
or
our
neglect
we
lost
her
as
we
came
ay
me
unhappy
then
my
fears
are
true
what
fears
good
thyrsis
prithee
briefly
shew
i
tell
ye
is
not
vain
or
fabulous
though
so
esteemed
by
shallow
ignorance
what
the
sage
poets
taught
by
the
heavenly
muse
storied
of
old
in
high
immortal
verse
of
dire
chimeras
and
enchanted
isles
and
rifted
rocks
whose
entrance
leads
to
hell
for
such
there
be
but
unbelief
is
blind
within
the
navel
of
this
hideous
wood
immured
in
cypress
shades
a
sorcerer
dwells
of
bacchus
and
of
circe
born
great
comus
deep
skilled
in
all
his
mother
witcheries
and
here
to
every
thirsty
wanderer
by
sly
enticement
gives
his
baneful
cup
with
many
murmurs
mixed
whose
pleasing
poison
the
visage
quite
transforms
of
him
that
drinks
and
the
inglorious
likeness
of
a
beast
fixes
instead
unmoulding
reason
mintage
charáctered
in
the
face
this
have
i
learnt
tending
my
flocks
hard
by
i
the
hilly
crofts
that
brow
this
bottom
glade
whence
night
by
night
he
and
his
monstrous
rout
are
heard
to
howl
like
stabled
wolves
or
tigers
at
their
prey
doing
abhorred
rites
to
hecate
in
their
obscuréd
haunts
of
inmost
bowers
yet
have
they
many
baits
and
guileful
spells
to
inveigle
and
invite
the
unwary
sense
of
them
that
pass
unweeting
by
the
way
this
evening
late
by
then
the
chewing
flocks
had
their
supper
on
the
savoury
herb
of
and
were
in
fold
i
sat
me
down
to
watch
upon
a
bank
with
ivy
canopied
and
interwove
with
flaunting
honeysuckle
and
began
wrapt
in
a
pleasing
fit
of
melancholy
to
meditate
my
rural
minstrelsy
till
fancy
had
her
fill
but
ere
a
close
the
wonted
roar
was
up
amidst
the
woods
and
filled
the
air
with
barbarous
dissonance
at
which
i
ceased
and
listened
them
awhile
till
an
unusual
stop
of
sudden
silence
gave
respite
to
the
drowsy
frighted
steeds
that
draw
the
litter
of
sleep
at
last
a
soft
and
sound
rose
like
a
steam
of
rich
distilled
perfumes
and
stole
upon
the
air
that
even
silence
was
took
ere
she
was
ware
and
wished
she
might
deny
her
nature
and
be
never
more
still
to
be
so
displaced
i
was
all
ear
and
took
in
strains
that
might
create
a
soul
under
the
ribs
of
death
but
oh
ere
long
too
well
i
did
perceive
it
was
the
voice
of
my
most
honoured
lady
your
dear
sister
amazed
i
stood
harrowed
with
grief
and
fear
and
o
poor
hapless
nightingale
thought
i
how
sweet
thou
how
near
the
deadly
snare
then
down
the
lawns
i
ran
with
headlong
haste
through
paths
and
turnings
often
trod
by
day
till
guided
by
mine
ear
i
found
the
place
where
that
damned
wizard
hid
in
sly
disguise
for
so
by
certain
signs
i
knew
had
met
already
ere
my
best
speed
could
prevent
the
aidless
innocent
lady
his
wished
prey
who
gently
asked
if
he
had
seen
such
two
supposing
him
some
neighbour
villager
longer
i
durst
not
stay
but
soon
i
guessed
ye
were
the
two
she
meant
with
that
i
sprung
into
swift
flight
till
i
had
found
you
here
but
further
know
i
not
o
night
and
shades
how
are
ye
joined
with
hell
in
triple
knot
against
the
unarmed
weakness
of
one
virgin
alone
and
helpless
is
this
the
confidence
you
gave
me
brother
yes
and
keep
it
still
lean
on
it
safely
not
a
period
shall
be
unsaid
for
me
against
the
threats
of
malice
or
of
sorcery
or
that
power
which
erring
men
call
chance
this
i
hold
firm
virtue
may
be
assailed
but
never
hurt
surprised
by
unjust
force
but
not
enthralled
yea
even
that
which
mischief
meant
most
harm
shall
in
the
happy
trial
prove
most
glory
but
evil
on
itself
shall
back
recoil
and
mix
no
more
with
goodness
when
at
last
gathered
like
scum
and
settled
to
itself
it
shall
be
in
eternal
restless
change
and
if
this
fail
the
pillared
firmament
is
rottenness
and
earth
base
built
on
stubble
but
come
let
on
against
the
opposing
will
and
arm
of
heaven
may
never
this
just
sword
be
lifted
up
but
for
that
damned
magician
let
him
be
girt
with
all
the
grisly
legions
that
troop
under
the
sooty
flag
of
acheron
harpies
and
hydras
or
all
the
monstrous
forms
africa
and
ind
i
find
him
out
and
force
him
to
return
his
purchase
back
or
drag
him
by
the
curls
to
a
foul
death
cursed
as
his
life
alas
good
venturous
youth
i
love
thy
courage
yet
and
bold
emprise
but
here
thy
sword
can
do
thee
little
stead
far
other
arms
and
other
weapons
must
be
those
that
quell
the
might
of
hellish
charms
he
with
his
bare
wand
can
unthread
thy
joints
and
crumble
all
thy
sinews
why
prithee
shepherd
how
durst
thou
then
thyself
approach
so
near
as
to
make
this
relation
care
and
utmost
shifts
how
to
secure
the
lady
from
surprisal
brought
to
my
mind
a
certain
shepherd
lad
of
small
regard
to
see
to
yet
well
skilled
in
every
virtuous
plant
and
healing
herb
that
spreads
her
verdant
leaf
to
the
morning
ray
he
loved
me
well
and
oft
would
beg
me
sing
which
when
i
did
he
on
the
tender
grass
would
sit
and
hearken
even
to
ecstasy
and
in
requital
ope
his
leathern
scrip
and
show
me
simples
of
a
thousand
names
telling
their
strange
and
vigorous
faculties
amongst
the
rest
a
small
unsightly
root
but
of
divine
effect
he
culled
me
out
the
leaf
was
darkish
and
had
prickles
on
it
but
in
another
country
as
he
said
bore
a
bright
golden
flower
but
not
in
this
soil
unknown
and
like
esteemed
and
the
dull
swain
treads
on
it
daily
with
his
clouted
shoon
and
yet
more
is
it
than
that
moly
that
hermes
once
to
wise
ulysses
gave
he
called
it
hæmony
and
gave
it
me
and
bade
me
keep
it
as
of
sovran
use
all
enchantments
mildew
blast
or
damp
or
ghastly
furies
apparition
i
pursed
it
up
but
little
reckoning
made
till
now
that
this
extremity
compelled
but
now
i
find
it
true
for
by
this
means
i
knew
the
foul
enchanter
though
disguised
entered
the
very
of
his
spells
and
yet
came
off
if
you
have
this
about
you
as
i
will
give
you
when
we
go
you
may
boldly
assault
the
necromancer
hall
where
if
he
be
with
dauntless
hardihood
and
brandished
blade
rush
on
him
break
his
glass
and
shed
the
luscious
liquor
on
the
ground
but
seize
his
wand
though
he
and
his
curst
crew
fierce
sign
of
battle
make
and
menace
high
or
like
the
sons
of
vulcan
vomit
smoke
yet
will
they
soon
retire
if
he
but
shrink
thyrsis
lead
on
apace
i
follow
thee
and
some
good
angel
bear
a
shield
before
us
scene
changes
to
a
stately
palace
set
out
with
all
manner
of
deliciousness
soft
music
tables
spread
with
all
dainties
comus
appears
with
his
rabble
and
the
lady
set
in
an
enchanted
chair
to
whom
he
offers
his
glass
which
she
puts
by
and
goes
about
to
nay
lady
sit
if
i
but
wave
this
wand
your
nerves
are
all
chained
up
in
alabaster
and
you
a
statue
or
as
daphne
was
that
fled
apollo
fool
do
not
boast
thou
canst
not
touch
the
freedom
of
my
mind
with
all
thy
charms
although
this
corporal
rind
thou
hast
immanacled
while
heaven
sees
good
why
are
you
vexed
lady
why
do
you
frown
here
dwell
no
frowns
nor
anger
from
these
gates
sorrow
flies
far
see
here
be
all
the
pleasures
that
fancy
can
beget
on
youthful
thoughts
when
the
fresh
blood
grows
lively
and
returns
brisk
as
the
april
buds
in
primrose
season
and
first
behold
this
cordial
julep
here
that
flames
and
dances
in
his
crystal
bounds
with
spirits
of
balm
and
fragrant
syrups
mixed
not
that
nepenthes
which
the
wife
of
thone
in
egypt
gave
to
helena
is
of
such
power
to
stir
up
joy
as
this
to
life
so
friendly
or
so
cool
to
thirst
why
should
you
be
so
cruel
to
yourself
and
to
those
dainty
limbs
which
nature
lent
for
gentle
usage
and
soft
delicacy
but
you
invert
the
covenants
of
her
trust
and
harshly
deal
like
an
ill
borrower
with
that
which
you
received
on
other
terms
scorning
the
unexempt
condition
by
which
all
mortal
frailty
must
subsist
refreshment
after
toil
ease
after
pain
that
have
been
tired
all
day
without
repast
and
timely
rest
have
wanted
but
fair
virgin
this
will
restore
all
soon
not
false
traitor
not
restore
the
truth
and
honesty
that
thou
hast
banished
from
thy
tongue
with
lies
was
this
the
cottage
and
the
safe
abode
thou
me
of
what
grim
aspects
are
these
these
monsters
mercy
guard
me
hence
with
thy
brewed
enchantments
foul
deceiver
hast
thou
betrayed
my
credulous
innocence
with
vizored
falsehood
and
base
forgery
and
thou
seek
again
to
trap
me
here
with
liquorish
baits
fit
to
ensnare
a
brute
were
it
a
draught
for
juno
when
she
banquets
i
would
not
taste
thy
treasonous
offer
none
but
such
as
are
good
men
can
give
good
things
and
that
which
is
not
good
is
not
delicious
to
a
and
wise
appetite
o
foolishness
of
men
that
lend
their
ears
to
those
budge
doctors
of
the
stoic
fur
and
fetch
their
precepts
from
the
cynic
tub
praising
the
lean
and
sallow
abstinence
wherefore
did
nature
pour
her
bounties
forth
with
such
a
full
and
unwithdrawing
hand
covering
the
earth
with
odours
fruits
and
flocks
thronging
the
seas
with
spawn
innumerable
but
all
to
please
and
sate
the
curious
taste
and
set
to
work
millions
of
spinning
worms
that
in
their
green
shops
weave
the
silk
to
deck
her
sons
and
that
no
corner
might
be
vacant
of
her
plenty
in
her
own
loins
she
hutched
the
ore
and
precious
gems
to
store
her
children
with
if
all
the
world
should
in
a
pet
of
temperance
feed
on
pulse
drink
the
clear
stream
and
nothing
wear
but
frieze
the
would
be
unthanked
would
be
unpraised
not
half
his
riches
known
and
yet
despised
and
we
should
serve
him
as
a
grudging
master
as
a
penurious
niggard
of
his
wealth
and
live
like
nature
bastards
not
her
sons
who
would
be
quite
surcharged
with
her
own
weight
and
strangled
with
her
waste
fertility
the
earth
cumbered
and
the
winged
air
darked
with
plumes
the
herds
would
their
lords
the
sea
would
swell
and
the
unsought
diamonds
would
so
emblaze
the
forehead
of
the
deep
and
so
bestud
with
stars
that
they
below
would
grow
inured
to
light
and
come
at
last
to
gaze
upon
the
sun
with
shameless
brows
list
lady
be
not
coy
and
be
not
cozened
with
that
same
vaunted
name
virginity
beauty
is
nature
coin
must
not
be
hoarded
but
must
be
current
and
the
good
thereof
consists
in
mutual
and
partaken
bliss
unsavoury
in
the
enjoyment
of
itself
if
you
let
slip
time
like
a
neglected
rose
it
withers
on
the
stalk
with
languished
head
beauty
is
nature
brag
and
must
be
shown
in
courts
at
feasts
and
high
solemnities
where
most
may
wonder
at
the
workmanship
it
is
for
homely
features
to
keep
home
they
had
their
name
thence
coarse
complexions
and
cheeks
of
sorry
grain
will
serve
to
ply
the
sampler
and
to
tease
the
huswife
wool
what
need
of
lip
for
that
eyes
or
tresses
like
the
morn
there
was
another
meaning
in
these
gifts
think
what
and
be
advised
you
are
but
young
yet
i
had
not
thought
to
have
unlocked
my
lips
in
this
unhallowed
air
but
that
this
juggler
would
think
to
charm
my
judgment
as
mine
eyes
obtruding
false
rules
pranked
in
reason
garb
i
hate
when
vice
can
bolt
her
arguments
and
virtue
has
no
tongue
to
check
her
pride
impostor
do
not
charge
most
innocent
nature
as
if
she
would
her
children
should
be
riotous
with
her
abundance
she
good
cateress
means
her
provision
only
to
the
good
that
live
according
to
her
sober
laws
and
holy
dictate
of
spare
temperance
if
every
just
man
that
now
pines
with
want
had
but
a
moderate
and
beseeming
share
of
that
which
luxury
now
heaps
upon
some
few
with
vast
excess
nature
full
blessings
would
be
well
dispensed
in
unsuperfluous
even
proportions
and
she
no
whit
encumbered
with
her
store
and
then
the
giver
would
be
better
thanked
his
praise
due
paid
for
swinish
gluttony
looks
to
heaven
amidst

some
portion
of

occurs
in

anything

it
is
to
this
metaphorical

a
river
of

remarkable
for
the
windings

the
verb
meander
and
hence
also
in
keightley
opinion
the
mention
of
the
river
as
a
haunt
of
echo
it
is
more
probable
however
that
as
the
lady
addresses
echo
as
the
sweet
queen
of
parley
and
the
unhappy
lover
of
the
lost
narcissus
the
river
is
here
mentioned
because
of
its
associations
with
music
and
misfortune
the
marsyas
was
a
tributary
of
the
maeander
and
the
legend
was
that
the
flute
upon
which
marsyas
played
in
his
rash
contest
with
apollo
was
carried
into
the
maeander
and
after
being
thrown
on
land
dedicated
to
apollo
the
god
of
song
comp
where
the
muses
and
misfortune
are
similarly
associated

reference
to
orpheus
whose
visage
and
lyre
were
carried
down
the
swift
hebrus
to

shore

the
maeander

called
by
ovid
since
the
above
was
written
hales
has
given
the
following
explanation
of
milton
allusion
the
real
reason
is
that
the
meander
was
a
famous
haunt
of
swans
and
the
swan
was
a
favourite
bird
with
the
greek
and
latin
writers
one
to
whose
sweet
singing
they
perpetually
allude
april
and
are
forms
of
the
same
word

notion
that
flowers
or

is
common

inlay
the
ground
in
the
flowers
themselves
wear
the
nightingale
is
made
to

vale
because
these
flowers
are
associated
with
love
see
jonson
of
and
with
innocence
see
iv
i
would
give
you
some
violets
but
they
withered
all
when
my
father
died
hales
however
thinks
that
some
particular
vale
is
here
alluded
to
and
argues
with
much
acumen
that
the
poet
referred
to
the
woodlands
close
by
athens
to
the
through
which
the
cephissus
flowed
and
where
stood
the
birthplace
of
sophocles
who
sings
of
his
native
colonus
as
frequented
by
nightingales
the
same
critic
regards
the
epithet
as
a
translation
of
the
greek
ἰοστέφανος
crowned
with
violets
frequently
applied
by
aristophanes
to
athens
of
which
colonus
was
a
suburb
macaulay
also
refers
to
athens
as
the
city
it
is
at
least
very
probable
that
milton
might
here
associate
the
nightingale
with
colonus
as
he
does
in
iv
see
the
following
note

nightingale
whose
loved
ones

her
piteous
melody
and
fills
the
country
round
with
the
plaints
of
her
sorrow
and
are

makes
frequent
allusion
to
the
nightingale

in

it
is
attic
bird
and
in
viii
it
is
amorous
bird
of
night
he
calls
it
the
attic
bird
in
allusion
to
the
story
of
philomela
the
daughter
of
pandion
king
of
athens
near
the
academy
was
colonus
which
sophocles
has
celebrated
as
the
haunt
of
nightingales
browne
philomela
was
changed
at
her
own
prayer
into
a
nightingale
that
she
might
escape
the
vengeance
of
her
tereus
the
epithet
however
seems
to
point
to
the
legend
of
aēdon
greek
ἀηδών
a
nightingale
who
having
killed
her
own
son
by
mistake
was
changed
into
a
nightingale
whose
mournful
song
was
represented
by
the
greek
poets
as
the
lament

spake

of

if
by

purity
the

gradually
became
spiritualised
and
therefore
partook
of
the
soul
immortality
above
all
grows
this
doctrine
is
expounded
in
plato
in
a
conversation
between
socrates
and
cebes
speaking
of
the
pure
soul
that
soul
i
say
herself
invisible
departs
to
the
invisible
world
to
the
divine
and
immortal
and
rational
thither
arriving
she
is
secure
of
bliss
and
is
released
from
the
error
and
folly
of
men
their
fears
and
wild
passions
and
all
other
human
ills
and
for
ever
dwells
as
they
say
of
the
initiated
in
company
with
the
gods
is
not
this
true
cebes
yes
beyond
a
doubt
but
the
soul
which
has
been
polluted
and
is
impure
at
the
time
of
her
departure
and
is
the
companion
and
servant
of
the
body
always
and
is
in
love
with
and
fascinated
by
the
body
and
by
the
desires
and
pleasures
of
the
body
until
she
is
led
to
believe
that
the
truth
only
exists
in
a
bodily
form
which
a
man
may
touch
and
see
and
taste
and
use
for
the
purposes
of
his
lusts
the
soul
i
mean
accustomed
to
hate
and
fear
and
avoid
the
intellectual
principle
which
to
the
bodily
eye
is
dark
and
invisible
and
can
be
attained
only
by
philosophy
do
you
suppose
that
such
a
soul
will
depart
pure
and
unalloyed
that
is
impossible
she
is
held
fast
by
the
corporeal
which
the
continual
association
and
constant
care
of
the
body
have
wrought
into
her
nature
very
true
and
this
corporeal
element
my
friend
is
heavy
and
weighty
and
earthy
and
is
that
element
by
which
such
a
soul
is
depressed
and
dragged
down
again
into
the
visible
world
because
she
is
afraid
of
the
invisible
and
of
the
world
below
prowling
about
tombs
and
sepulchres
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
as
they
tell
us
are
seen
certain
ghostly
apparitions
of
souls
which
have
not
departed
pure
but
are
cloyed
with
sight
and
therefore
visible
that
is
very
likely
socrates
yes
that
is
very
likely
cebes
and
these
must
be
the
souls
not
of
the
good
but
of
the
evil
who
are
compelled
to
wander
about
such
places
in
payment
of
the
penalty
of
their
former
evil
way
of
life
and
they
continue
to
wander
until
through
the
craving
after
the
corporeal
which
never
leaves
them
they
are
imprisoned
finally
in
another
body
and
they
may
be
supposed
to
find
their
prisons
in
the
same
natures
which
they
have
had
in
their
former
lives
further
on
in
the
same
dialogue
socrates
says
each
pleasure
and
pain
is
a
sort
of
nail
which
nails
and
rivets
the
soul
to
the
body
until
she
becomes
like
the
body
and
believes
that
to
be
true
which
the
body
affirms
to
be
true
and
from
agreeing
with
the
body
and
having
the
same
delights
she
is
obliged
to
have
the
same
habits
and
haunts
and
is
not
likely
ever
to
be
pure
at
her
departure
but
is
always
infected
by
the
from
jowett
translation

the

may
have

by
the

the

of
the
wicked
are
said
to
find
their
prisons
in
the

which
they
have

this
makes
objective
and
a
preposition
the
only
objection
to
this
reading
is
that
the
notion
of
crowning
the
head
upon
the
banks
is
peculiar
the
difficulty
vanishes
when
we
recollect
that
milton
frequently
connects
two
clauses
with
one
subject
rather
loosely
the
subject
of
the
second
clause
is
implied

is
found
in

the
prize
also

to

etc
also
in
the
explanation
adopted
by
masson
is
that
milton
had
in
view
two
greek
verbs
περιστεφανόω
put
a
crown
round
and
ἐπιστεφανόω
to
put
a
crown
upon
thus
may
thy
lofty
head
be
with
many
a
tower
and
terrace
and
thy
banks
here
and
there
be
with
groves
of
myrrh

makes

removed
when

substituted

confusion
of

a
more
correct
view
seems
to
be
that

the
which
was
in
old
english
used
with
a
singular
noun

without

the
ordinary
view
of
cupid
is
given
in
the
note
to
line
here
he
is
the
lover
of
psyche
the
human
soul
to
whom
he
is
united
after
she
has
been
purified
by
a
life
of
trial
and
misfortune
the
myth
of
cupid
and
psyche
is
as
follows
cupid
was
in
love
with
psyche
but
warned
her
that
she
must
not
seek
to
know
who
he
was
yielding
to
curiosity
however
she
drew
near
to
him
with
a
lamp
while
he
was
asleep
a
drop
of
the
hot
oil
falling
on
him
he
awoke
and
fled
from
her
she
now
wandered
from
place
to
place
persecuted
by
venus
but
after
great
sorrow
during
which
she
was
secretly
supported
by
cupid
she
became
immortal
and
was
united
to
him
for
ever
in
this
story
psyche
represents
the
human
soul
gk
ψυχή
which
is
disciplined
and
purified
by
earthly
misfortune
and
so
fitted
for
the
enjoyment
of
true
happiness
in
heaven
further
in
milton
allegory
it
is
only
the
soul
so
purified
that
is
capable
of
knowing
true
love
in
his
for
he
calls
it
that
love
whose
charming
cup
is
only
virtue
and
whose
first
and
chiefest
office
begins
and
ends
in
the
soul
producing
those
happy
twins
of
her
divine
generation
knowledge
and
virtue
to
this
high
and
mystical
love
milton
again
alludes
in
in
other
part
the
expansive
vault
above
and
there
too
even
there
the
god
of
love
with
quiver
armed
he
mounts
his
torch
displays
a
vivid
light
his
arrows
blaze
around
his
bright
and
fiery
eyes
he
rolls
nor
aims
at
vulgar
minds
or
little
souls
nor
deigns
one
look
below
but
aiming
high
sends
every
arrow
to
the
lofty
sky
hence
forms
divine
and
minds
immortal

power

preposition

subjunctive
after
its
nominative
is
blest
is
cognate
with
and
comp
the
kingdoms
meek
of
joy
and
love
to
be
there
seems
to
be
here
a
confusion
of
constructions
between
the
subjunctive
with
and
the
indicative
dependent
in
meaning
on
jove
hath
sworn
in
the
following
line
and
everlasting
youth
and
joy
are
found
only
after
the
trials
of
earth
are
past
so
spenser
makes

the
daughter
of
cupid
and
psyche
but
she
is
the
daughter

she
is
possible
only
to
the

a

expression
of
that
confidence
in
the
invincibleness
of

by

providence

therefore
a

conclusion
of
