chapter
i
edward
fillery
so
far
as
may
be
possible
to
a
man
of
normal
passions
and
emotions
took
a
detached
view
of
life
and
human
nature
at
the
age
of
he
still
remained
a
spectator
a
searching
critical
analytical
yet
chiefly
perhaps
a
sympathetic
spectator
before
the
great
performance
whose
stage
is
the
planet
and
whose
performers
and
auditorium
are
humanity
knowing
himself
outcast
an
unwelcome
deadhead
at
the
play
he
had
yet
felt
no
bitterness
against
the
parents
whose
fierce
illicit
passion
had
deprived
him
of
an
honourable
seat
the
first
shock
of
resentment
over
he
had
faced
the
situation
with
a
tolerance
which
showed
an
unusual
charity
an
exceptional
understanding
in
one
so
young
he
was
twenty
when
he
learned
the
truth
about
himself
and
it
was
his
wondering
analysis
as
to
why
two
loving
humans
could
be
so
careless
of
their
offspring
welfare
when
the
rest
of
nature
took
such
pains
in
the
matter
that
first
betrayed
perhaps
his
natural
aptitude
he
had
the
innate
gift
of
seeing
things
as
they
were
undisturbed
by
personal
emotion
while
yet
asking
himself
with
scientific
accuracy
why
and
how
they
came
to
be
so
these
were
invaluable
qualities
in
the
line
of
knowledge
and
research
he
chose
for
himself
as
psychologist
and
doctor
the
terms
are
somewhat
loose
his
longing
was
to
probe
the
motives
of
conduct
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
to
correct
the
results
of
wrong
conduct
by
removing
faulty
motives
psychiatrist
and
healer
therefore
were
his
more
accurate
titles
psychiatrist
and
healer
in
due
course
he
became
his
father
an
engineer
of
ability
and
enterprise
prospecting
in
the
remoter
parts
of
the
caucasus
for
copper
and
making
a
comfortable
fortune
in
so
doing
was
carried
off
his
feet
suddenly
by
the
beauty
of
a
khaketian
peasant
girl
daughter
of
a
shepherd
in
these
lonely
and
majestic
mountains
whose
intolerable
grandeur
may
well
intoxicate
a
man
to
madness
a
dangerous
and
disgraceful
episode
it
seems
to
have
been
between
john
fillery
hitherto
of
steady
moral
fibre
and
this
strange
lovely
pagan
girl
whose
savage
father
hunted
the
pair
of
them
high
and
low
for
weeks
before
they
finally
eluded
him
in
the
azalea
valleys
beyond
artvine
great
passion
possibly
great
love
born
of
this
enchanted
land
whose
peaks
touch
heaven
while
their
lower
turfy
slopes
are
carpeted
with
lilies
azaleas
rhododendrons
contributed
to
the
birth
of
edward
who
first
saw
the
light
in
a
secret
chamber
of
a
dirty
tiflis
house
above
the
koura
torrent
that
same
night
when
the
sun
dipped
beneath
the
black
sea
waters
two
hundred
miles
to
the
westward
his
mother
had
looked
for
the
last
time
upon
her
northern
lover
and
her
wild
caucasian
mountains
edward
however
persisted
visible
emblem
of
a
few
weeks
primal
passion
in
a
primal
land
intense
desire
born
in
this
remote
wilderness
of
amazing
loveliness
lent
him
perhaps
a
strain
of
illicit
almost
unearthly
yearning
a
secret
nostalgia
for
some
lost
vale
of
beauty
that
held
fiercer
sunshine
mightier
winds
and
fairer
flowers
than
those
he
knew
in
this
world
at
the
age
of
four
he
was
brought
to
england
his
russian
memories
faded
though
not
the
birthright
of
his
primitive
blood
settling
in
london
his
father
increased
his
fortune
as
consulting
engineer
but
did
not
marry
to
the
short
vehement
episode
he
had
given
of
his
very
best
he
remained
true
to
his
gorgeous
memory
and
his
sin
the
cream
of
his
life
its
essence
and
its
perfume
had
been
spent
in
those
wild
azalea
valleys
beyond
artvine
the
azalea
honey
was
in
his
blood
the
scent
of
the
lilies
in
his
brain
he
still
heard
the
koura
and
rion
foaming
down
towards
ancient
colchis
edward
embodied
for
him
the
spirit
of
these
sweet
passionate
memories
he
loved
the
boy
he
cherished
and
he
spoilt
him
but
edward
had
stuff
in
him
that
rendered
spoiling
harmless
a
vigorous
independent
youngster
he
showed
firmness
and
character
as
a
lad
to
the
delight
of
his
father
he
knew
his
own
mind
early
reading
and
studying
on
his
own
account
possessed
at
the
same
time
by
a
vehement
love
of
nature
and
outdoor
life
that
was
far
more
than
the
average
english
boy
inclination
to
open
air
and
sport
there
lay
some
primal
quality
in
his
blood
that
was
of
ancient
origin
and
leaned
towards
wildness
there
seemed
almost
at
the
same
time
a
faunish
strain
that
turned
away
from
life
as
a
tiny
little
fellow
he
had
that
strange
touch
of
creative
imagination
other
children
have
also
known
an
invisible
playmate
it
had
no
name
as
it
apparently
had
no
sex
the
boy
father
could
trace
it
directly
to
no
fairy
tale
read
or
heard
its
origin
in
the
child
mind
remained
a
mystery
but
its
characteristics
were
unusual
even
for
such
fanciful
imaginings
too
to
have
been
created
gradually
by
the
boy
loneliness
it
seemed
half
goblin
and
half
it
replaced
at
any
rate
the
little
brothers
and
sisters
who
were
not
there
and
the
father
led
by
his
conscience
possibly
to
divine
or
half
divine
its
origin
met
the
pretence
with
sympathetic
encouragement
it
came
usually
with
the
wind
moreover
and
went
with
the
wind
and
wind
accordingly
excited
the
child
listen
father
he
would
exclaim
when
no
air
was
moving
anywhere
and
the
day
was
still
as
death
then
plop
so
there
you
are
as
though
it
had
dropped
through
empty
space
and
landed
at
his
feet
it
came
from
a
tremenjus
height
the
child
explained
the
wind
up
you
see
which
struck
the
parent
mind
as
odd
because
it
proved
later
true
an
upper
wind
far
in
the
higher
strata
of
air
came
down
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
and
blew
into
a
storm
fire
and
flowers
too
were
connected
with
this
invisible
playmate
make
it
burn
father
the
child
said
convincingly
when
the
chimney
smoked
and
the
coals
refused
to
catch
and
then
became
very
busy
with
his
friend
in
the
grate
and
about
the
hearth
just
as
though
he
helped
and
superintended
what
was
being
invisibly
accomplished
it
burning
better
anyhow
agreed
the
father
astonished
in
spite
of
himself
as
the
coals
began
to
glow
and
spurt
their
gassy
flames
well
done
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
and
your
little
friend
but
it
the
only
thing
he
can
do
he
likes
it
it
his
work
really
do
you
see
keeping
up
the
heat
in
things
oh
it
his
natural
job
is
it
i
see
yes
but
my
thanks
to
him
all
the
same
thank
you
very
much
said
grave
edward
aged
five
addressing
his
tiny
friend
among
the
i
much
mobliged
to
you
edward
was
a
bit
older
when
the
flower
incident
took
place
with
the
geranium
that
no
amount
of
care
and
coaxing
seemed
able
to
keep
alive
it
had
been
dying
slowly
for
some
days
when
edward
announced
that
he
saw
its
inside
flitting
about
the
plant
but
unable
to
get
back
into
it
it
got
out
you
see
and
ca
get
back
into
its
body
again
so
it
dying
well
what
in
the
world
are
we
to
do
about
it
asked
his
father
i
ask
was
the
solemn
reply
now
i
know
he
cried
delighted
after
asking
his
question
of
the
empty
air
and
listening
for
the
answer
of
course
now
i
see
look
father
there
it
is
its
spirit
he
stood
beside
the
flower
and
pointed
to
the
earth
in
the
pot
dear
me
yes
where
see
it
i
do
see
it
quite
he
says
i
can
pick
it
up
and
put
it
back
and
then
the
flower
will
live
the
child
put
out
a
hand
as
though
picking
up
something
that
moved
quickly
about
the
stem
what
it
look
like
asked
his
father
quickly
oh
sort
of
trinangles
and
things
with
lines
and
corners
was
the
reply
making
a
gesture
as
though
he
caught
it
and
popped
it
back
into
the
red
drooping
blossoms
there
you
are
now
you
alive
again
thank
you
very
much
please
this
last
remark
to
the
invisible
playmate
who
was
superintending
a
sort
of
geometrical
figure
was
it
inquired
the
father
next
day
when
to
his
surprise
he
found
the
geranium
blooming
in
full
health
and
beauty
once
again
that
what
you
saw
eh
it
was
its
spirit
and
it
was
shiny
red
like
fire
the
child
replied
it
heat
without
these
things
there
be
no
flowers
at
all
who
makes
everything
grow
he
asked
suddenly
a
moment
later
you
mean
makes
them
grow
who
he
repeated
with
emphasis
who
builds
the
bodies
up
and
looks
after
them
ah
the
structure
you
mean
the
form
edward
nodded
his
father
had
the
feeling
he
was
not
being
asked
for
information
but
was
being
a
faint
pressure
as
of
uneasiness
touched
him
they
develop
automatically
that
means
naturally
under
the
laws
of
nature
he
replied
and
the
laws
who
keeps
them
working
properly
the
father
with
a
mental
gulp
replied
that
god
did
a
beetle
body
for
instance
or
a
daisy
or
an
elephant
persisted
the
child
undeceived
by
the
theological
evasion
or
mine
or
a
mountain
john
fillery
racked
his
brain
for
an
answer
while
edward
continued
his
list
to
include
fire
wind
moon
sun
and
stars
all
these
forms
to
him
were
bodies
apparently
i
know
he
exclaimed
suddenly
with
intense
conviction
clapping
his
hands
together
and
standing
on
his
toes
do
you
indeed
then
you
know
more
than
the
rest
of
us
of
course
came
the
positive
announcement
the
other
kind
it
their
work
yours
for
instance
he
turned
to
his
playmate
but
so
naturally
and
convincingly
that
a
chill
ran
down
his
spine
as
he
watched
is
fire
is
it
you
showed
me
once
and
water
stops
you
but
wind
helps
you
and
he
continued
long
after
his
father
had
left
the
room
with
advancing
years
however
edward
either
forgot
his
playmate
or
kept
its
activities
to
himself
he
no
longer
referred
to
it
at
any
rate
his
energies
demanded
a
bigger
field
he
roamed
the
fields
and
woods
climbed
the
hills
stayed
out
all
night
to
see
the
sunrise
made
fires
even
when
fires
were
not
exactly
needed
and
hunted
with
red
indians
and
with
what
he
called
people
everywhere
he
was
never
in
the
house
he
ran
wild
great
open
spaces
trees
and
flowers
were
what
he
liked
the
sea
on
the
other
hand
alarmed
him
only
wind
and
fire
comforted
him
and
made
him
happy
and
full
of
life
he
was
a
playmate
of
wind
and
fire
water
in
large
quantities
at
any
rate
was
inimical
with
concealed
approval
masking
a
deep
love
fulfilled
yet
incomplete
his
father
watched
the
growth
of
this
fiercer
strain
that
mere
covert
shooting
could
not
satisfy
nor
ordinary
sporting
holidays
appease
england
too
small
for
you
edward
is
it
he
asked
once
tentatively
when
the
boy
was
about
fifteen
the
english
people
you
mean
father
you
find
them
dull
do
you
and
the
island
a
bit
cramped
eh
edward
waited
without
replying
he
did
not
quite
understand
what
his
indulgent
father
intended
or
was
leading
up
to
you
like
to
travel
and
see
things
and
people
for
yourself
i
mean
he
watched
the
boy
without
as
he
thought
the
latter
noticing
the
answer
pleased
but
puzzled
him
we
all
much
the
same
are
we
said
edward
well
with
differences
yes
we
are
but
still
it
only
the
same
over
and
over
again
is
it
then
while
his
father
was
thinking
of
this
reply
and
of
what
he
should
say
to
it
the
boy
asked
suddenly
with
arresting
intensity
are
we
the
only
people
the
only
sort
of
beings
i
mean
just
men
and
women
like
us
all
over
the
world
no
others
of
any
sort
bigger
for
instance
or
more
wild
and
wonderful
then
he
added
a
thrust
of
strange
yearning
in
his
face
and
eyes
more
beautiful
he
almost
whispered
the
last
words
his
father
winced
he
divined
the
origin
of
that
strange
inquiry
upon
those
immense
and
lonely
mountains
distant
in
space
and
time
for
him
imagination
rich
and
pagan
ran
he
well
knew
to
vast
and
mighty
beings
superior
to
human
benignant
and
maleficent
akin
to
the
stimulating
and
exhilarating
conception
of
the
gods
and
certainly
nothing
edward
that
we
know
of
why
should
there
be
oh
i
do
know
dad
i
just
wondered
sometimes
but
as
you
say
we
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
of
course
not
a
scrap
agreed
his
father
poetic
legends
ai
evidence
the
mind
ruled
the
heart
in
edward
he
had
his
father
brains
at
any
rate
and
all
his
powers
and
longings
focused
in
a
single
line
that
indicated
plainly
what
his
career
should
be
the
public
schools
could
help
him
little
he
went
to
edinburgh
to
study
medicine
he
passed
eventually
with
all
possible
honours
and
the
day
he
brought
home
the
news
his
father
dying
told
him
the
secret
of
his
illegitimate
birth
chapter
ii
the
subsequent
twenty
years
or
so
may
be
summarized
alone
in
the
world
of
a
loving
passionate
nature
he
deliberately
set
all
thought
of
marriage
on
one
side
as
an
impossibility
and
directed
his
entire
energy
into
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
reading
studying
experimenting
far
outside
the
circle
of
the
ordinary
medical
man
the
attitude
of
detachment
he
had
adopted
became
a
habit
he
believed
it
was
now
his
nature
the
more
he
learned
of
human
frailty
and
human
faculties
the
greater
became
the
charity
he
felt
towards
his
in
his
own
being
it
seemed
lay
something
big
sweet
simple
a
generosity
that
longed
to
share
with
others
a
tolerance
more
ready
to
acquit
than
to
condemn
above
all
a
great
gift
of
understanding
sympathy
that
doubtless
was
the
explanation
of
his
singular
insight
rarely
he
found
it
in
him
to
blame
forgiveness
based
upon
the
increasing
extent
of
his
experience
seemed
his
natural
view
of
human
mistakes
and
human
infirmities
his
one
desire
his
one
hope
was
to
serve
the
race
yet
he
himself
remained
aloof
he
watched
the
play
but
took
no
part
in
it
this
forgiveness
too
began
at
home
his
grievance
had
not
soured
or
dejected
him
his
father
error
presenting
itself
as
a
problem
to
be
pondered
over
rather
than
a
sin
to
blame
some
day
he
promised
himself
he
would
go
and
see
with
his
own
eyes
the
khaketian
tribe
whence
his
blood
was
partially
derived
whence
his
yearnings
for
a
wilder
scale
of
personal
freedom
amid
an
unstained
majestic
nature
were
first
stolen
the
inherited
picture
of
a
caucasian
vale
of
loveliness
and
liberty
lay
indeed
very
deep
in
his
nature
emerging
always
like
a
symbol
when
he
was
profoundly
moved
at
any
crisis
in
his
life
it
rose
beckoning
seductive
haunting
beyond
words
curious
emotions
with
it
that
drove
him
towards
another
standard
another
state
to
something
at
any
rate
he
could
neither
name
nor
visualize
yet
that
seemed
to
dwarf
the
only
life
he
knew
about
it
was
a
touch
of
strange
unearthly
radiance
that
dimmed
existence
as
he
knew
it
the
shine
went
out
of
it
there
was
involved
in
this
symbolic
valley
something
wholly
new
both
in
colour
sound
and
outline
yet
that
remained
obstinately
outside
definition
first
however
he
must
work
develop
himself
and
broaden
deepen
extend
in
every
possible
way
the
knowledge
of
his
kind
that
seemed
his
only
love
he
began
in
a
very
practical
way
setting
up
his
plate
in
a

his
patience

backed

brought

he
was
soon
in
a
fair
way
to
become
a
fashionable

but
the
field
he
found
was
restricted
somewhat
his
quest
was
knowledge
not
fame
or
money
he
chose
his
cases
where
he
could
though
actually
refusing
nothing
he
specialized

and
more
with

he
was

stimulated
the

he

human

object
to
sudden
changes
whose
secret
they
have
not

and
can
not

his
abrupt
disappearance
caused
talk
and
rumours
led
of
course
by
those
chiefly
disappointed
women
who
had
most
reason
to
be
grateful
for
past
services
but
if
the
words
charlatan
and
quack
were
whispered
he
did
not
hear
them
he
had
taken
the
post
of
assistant
in
a
lunatic
asylum
in
a
northern
town
because
the
work
promised
him
increase
of
knowledge
and
experience
in
his
own
particular
field
the
talk
he
left
behind
him
mattered
as
little
as
the
small

attached
to
the
humble
duties
he
had
accepted
london
forgot
him
but
he
did
not
forget
what
london
had
taught
him
a
new
field
opened
and
in
less
than
two
years
opportunity
combined
with
his
undoubted
qualifications
saw
him
head
of
an
establishment
where
he
could
observe
at
first

facts
and
phenomena
that
interested
him
most
humane
treatment
backed
by
profound
insight
into
the
derangements
of
the
poor
human
creatures
under
his
charge
brought
the
place
into
a
fame
it
had
never
known
before
he
spent
five
years
there
in
profound
study
and
experiment
he
achieved
new
results
and
published
them
his
caused
a
sensation
his
name
was
known
he
was
an
authority
at
this
time
he
was
well
past
thirty
a
tall
dark
man
of
appearance
grave
and
even
sombre
imposing
too
with
his
quiet
piercing
eyes
but
sombre
only
until
the
smile
lit
up
his
somewhat
rugged
face
it
was
a
face
that
nobody
could
lie
to
but
to
that
smile
the
suffering
heart
might
tell
its
inmost
secrets
with
confidence
hope
trust
and
without
reserve
there
followed
several
years
abroad
in
paris
rome
petersburg
moscow
vienna
and
zurich
he
also
visited
to
test
there
certain
lines
of
research
and
to
meet
personally
their
originators
this
period
was
partly
a
holiday
partly
an
opportunity
to
know
at
first
hand
the
leaders
in
mental
therapeutics
psychology
and
the
rest
and
also
that
he
might
find
time
to
digest
and
arrange
his
own
accumulation
of
knowledge
with
a
view
later
to
undertaking
the
to
which
his
previous
experience
was
but
preliminary
fame
had
come
to
him
unsought
his
published
works
alone
ensured
his
going
down
to
posterity
as
a
careful
but
daring
and
original
judge
of
the
human
species
and
its
possibilities
it
was
the
supernormal
rather
than
the
merely
abnormal
powers
that
attracted
him
in
the
subconscious
as
equally
in
the
superconscious
his
deep
experience
taught
him
lay
amazing
powers
of
both
moral
and
physical
healing
powers
as
yet
but
little
understood
powers
as
limitless
as
they
seemed
incredible
as
mysterious
in
their
operation
as
they
were
simple
in
their
accessibility
and
was
the
means
of
using
them
the
great
men
whom
he
visited
welcomed
him
with
open
arms
added
to
his
data
widened
yet
further
his
mental
outlook
sought
by
high
and
low
in
many
countries
and
in
strangest
cases
his
experience
grew
and
multiplied
his
assortment
of
unusual
knowledge
was
till
he
stood
finally
in
wonder
and
amazement
before
the
human
being
and
its
unrealized
powers
and
his
optimism
concerning
the
future
progress
of
the
race
became
more
justified
with
every
added
fact
yet
perhaps
his
greatest
achievement
was
the
study
of
himself
it
was
probably
to
this
deep
intimate
and
honest
research
into
his
own
being
that
his
success
in
helping
others
was
primarily
due
for
in
himself
though
mastered
and
by
his
steady
will
rendered
harmless
by
his
saving
sense
of
humour
and
as
he
believed
by
the
absence
of
any
harboured
grievance
against
others
in
his
very
own
being
lay
all
those
potential
elements
of
disorder
those
loose
unravelled
threads
of
alien
impulse
and
suppressed
desire
which
can
make
for
dangerous
disintegration
and
thus
produce
the
disturbing
results
classed
generally
under
alienation
and
neurosis
the
incongruous
elements
in
him
were
the
gift
of
nature
γνῶθι
σεαυτόν
was
the
saving
attitude
he
brought
to
that
gift
redeeming
it
this
phrase
borrowed
he
remembered
with
a
smile
for
the
portal
of
the
ancient
mysteries
remained
his
watchword
he
was
able
to
thank
the
fierce
illicit
love
that
furnished
his
body
and
his
mental
for
a
richer
field
of
study
than
years
of
practice
among
others
could
have
supplied
he
belonged
by
temperament
to
the
unstable
but
he
was
aware
of
it
he
realized
the
two
beings
in
him
the
reasoning
scientific
man
and
the
speculative
dreamer
visionary
poet
the
latter
wondered
dreamed
among
a
totally
different
set
of
values
far
below
and
out
of
sight
this
deeper
portion
of
himself
was
forever
beating
up
for
recognition
clamouring
to
be
used
yet
with
the
strange
shyness
that
reminded
him
of
a
loving
woman
who
can
not
be
certain
her
passion
is
returned
it
hinted
threatened
wept
and
even
sulked
it
rose
like
a
flame
bringing
its
own
light
and
wind
blessed
his
whole
being
with
some
divine
assurance
and
then
because
not
instantly
accepted
it
retired
leaving
him
empty
his
mind
coloured
with
unearthly
yearnings
with
poignant
regrets
yet
perfumed
as
though
the
fairness
of
spring
herself
had
lit
upon
his
heart
and
kissed
it
into
blossom
on
her
passage
north
it
presented
its
amazing
pictures
and
withdrew
elusive
as
the
half
memory
of
some
radiant
dream
whose
wonder
and
sweetness
have
been
intense
to
the
point
of
almost
pain
it
hovered
floating
just
out
of
reach
it
lay
waiting
for
that
sincere
belief
which
would
convince
that
its
passion
was
returned
and
a
fleeting
picture
of
a
wild
caucasian
valley
steeped
in
sunshine
and
flowers
was
always
the
first
sign
of
its
awakening
though
not
afraid
of
reason
it
seemed
somehow
independent
of
the
latter
processes
it
was
his
reason
however
he
well
knew
that
dimmed
the
light
in
its
grand
terrible
eyes
causing
it
to
withdraw
the
instant
he
began
to
question
precise
formal
thinking
shut
the
engines
off
and
damped
the
furnaces
his
love
his
passion
none
the
less
were
there
hiding
with
belief
until
some
bright
messenger
bringing
glad
tidings
should
reveal
the
method
of
harmonious
union
between
reason
and
vision
between
man
trivial
normal
faculties
and
his
astounding
supernormal
possibilities
this
element
of
feeling
in
our
outlook
on
nature
is
a
satisfaction
in
itself
but
our
plea
for
allowing
it
to
operate
in
our
interpretation
of
nature
is
that
we
get
closer
to
some
things
through
feeling
than
we
do
through
science
the
tendency
of
feeling
is
always
to
see
things
whole
we
can
not
for
our
life
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
our
philosophical
reconstruction
afford
to
lose
in
scientific
analysis
what
the
poets
and
artists
and
the
lovers
of
nature
all
see
it
is
intuitively
felt
rather
than
intellectually
perceived
the
vision
of
things
as
totalities
root
and
all
all
in
all
neither
fancifully
nor
mystically
but
sympathetically
in
their
wholeness
to
these
words

professor
arthur
thomson
he
heartily
subscribed
applying
their
principle
to
his
own
particular
field
chapter
iii
the
net
result
of
his
inquiries
and
research
when
at
the
age
of
nearly
forty
he
established
his
own
private
home
for
unusual
hopeless
cases
in
london
it
was
free
to
all
and
as
spiritual
clinique
he
thought
of
it
sometimes
with
a
smile
may
be
summed
up
in
the
single
sentence
that
man
is
greater
than
he
knows
and
that
completer
realization
of
his
full
possibilities
lies
accessible
to
his
subconscious
and
superconscious
powers
herein
he
saw
indeed
the
chief
hope
of
progress
for
humanity
and
it
was
to
the
failures
the
diseased
the
evil
and
the
broken
that
he
owed
chiefly
his
inspiring
optimism
since
it
was
largely
in
collapse
that
occurred
the
sporadic
upheaval
of
those
forces
which
controlled
led
must
eventually
bring
about
the
realization
he
foresaw
the
purpose
however
of
these
notes
is
not
to
furnish
a
sensational
story
of
various
patients
whom
he
studied
healed
or
failed
to
heal
its
object
is
to
give
some
details
of
one
case
in
particular
whose
outstanding
peculiarities
affected
his
theories
and
convictions
leaving
him
still
but
with
a
breath
of
awe
in
his
heart
perhaps
before
a
possibility
his
previous
knowledge
had
ruled
entirely
out
of
court
even
if
which
is
doubtful
he
had
ever
considered
it
as
a
possibility
at
all
he
had
realized
early
that
the
individual
manifests
but
an
insignificant
portion
of
his
being
in
his
ordinary
existence
the
normal
self
being
the
tip
of
his
consciousness
only
yet
whose
fuller
expression
rises
readily
to
adequate
evocation
and
it
was
the
study
of
genius
of
prodigies
and
of
certain
faculties
shown
sometimes
in
hysteria
that
led
him
to
believe
these
were
small
jets
from
a
sea
of
power
that
might
indeed
ought
to
be
realizable
at
will
the
phenomena

functions
as
they
were

capable
of

his
heart
glowed
within
him
as
he
established
step
by
step
these
greater
powers
he
dared
to
foresee
a
time
when
the
limitations
of
separate
personality
would
have
been
destroyed
and
the
vast
brotherhood
of
the
race
become
literally
realized
its
practical
unity
accomplished
the
difficulties
were
endless
and
discouraging
the
inventive
powers
of
the
bigger
self
its
astonishing
faculty
for
dramatizing
its
content
in
every
conceivable
form
blocked
everywhere
the
search
for
truth
it
could
he
found
also
detach
a
portion
of
its
content
into
a
series
of
separate
personalities
each
with
its
individual
morals

tendencies
each
with
its
distinct
and
separate
memory
these
fragments
it
could
project

speak

convincingly
as
separate
entities
using
strange
languages
offering
detailed
knowledge
of
other
conditions
distant
in
time
and
space
suggesting
indeed
to
the
unwary
that
they
were
due
to
obsessing
spirits
and
leaving
the
observer
in
wonder
before
the
potential
capacity
of
the
central
self
disgorging
them
the
human
depths
included
beyond
mere
telepathy
and

expansion

were
finding

state
it
shortly
might
be
the

this
was
the
hope
though
not
yet
the
actual
belief
that
haunted
and
inspired
him
behind
his
personality
lurked
this
strange
gigantic
dream
ever
beating
to
get
through
in
his
private
home
helping
healing
using
his
great
gifts
of
sympathy
and
insight
he
at
the

found
the
material
for
intimate
study
and
legitimate
experiment
he
sought
the
building
had
been
altered
to
suit
his
exact
requirements
there
were
private
suites
each
with
its
door
and
staircase
to
the
street
one
part
of
it
provided
his
own
living
quarters
shut
off
entirely
from
the
side
in
another
equally
cut
off
and
yet
within
easy
communication
of
his

rooms
lived
paul
devonham
his
valued
young
assistant
there
was
a
third
private
suite
as
well
the
entire
expenses
he
defrayed
himself
here
then
for
a
year
or
two
he
worked
indefatigably
with
the
measure
of
success
and
failure
he
anticipated
here
he
dreamed
his
great
dream
of
the
future
of
the
race
in
whose
progress
and
infinite
capacities
he
hopefully
believed
work
was
his
love
the
advancement
of
humanity
his
god
the
war
availed
itself
of
his
great
powers
as
also
of
his
establishment
both
of
which
he
gave
without
a
thought
of
self
new
material
came
as
well
from
the
battlefields
into
his
ken
the
effect
of
the
terrible
five
years
upon
him
was
in
direct
proportion
to
his
sincerity
his
mind
was
not
the
type
that
shirks
conclusions
nor
fears
to
look
facts
in
the
face
for
really
new
knowledge
he
was
ever
ready
to
yield
all
previous
theories
to
scrap
all
he
had
held
hitherto
for
probable
his
mind
was
open
he
sought
only
truth
the
war
above
all
the
peace
shook
his
optimism
if
it
did
not
wholly
shatter
his
belief
in
human
progress
it
proved
such
progress
to
be
so
slow
that
his
utopia
faded
into
remotest
distance
and
his
dream
of
perfectibility
became
the
faintest
possible
star
in
his
hitherto
bright
sky
of
hope
he
felt
shocked
and
stupefied
the
reaction
was
greater
than
at
first
he
realized
he
had
often
pitied
the
mind
that
aware
only
of
its
surface
consciousness
uninformed
by
thrill
or
shift
of
the
great
powers
below
and
above
lived
unwarned
of
its
own
immenser
possibilities
to
such
the
evidence
for
extended
human
faculties
must
seem
explicable
by
fraud
illusion
derangement
to
be
classed
as
abnormal
rubbish
worthy
only
of
the
alienist
attention
as
diseases
to
him
such
minds
though
able
with
big
intellects
among
them
had
ever
seemed
a
prejudiced
fossilized
prehistoric
type
restricted
by
their
very
nature
violently
resisting
new
ideas
they
might
be
intense
within
their
actual
scope
but
with
vision
denied
them
they
never
could
be
really
great
one
effect
of
the
shock
he
had
undergone
will
be
evident
by
merely
stating
that
he
now
understood
this
type
of
mind
a
good
deal
better
than
before
chapter
iv
the
war
was
over
though
the
benefits
of
the
long
anticipated
peace
still
kept
provocatively
exasperatingly
out
of
reach
when
about
the
middle
of
september
fillery
received
a
letter
that
interested
him
deeply
the
shattered
world
was
still
distraught
uneasy
nervously
eager
to
resume
its
former
activities
it
was
yet
waiting
for
the
word
that
should
give
it
the
necessary
confidence
to
begin
doubt
insecurity
uncertainty
everywhere
dominated
human
minds
those
who
hoped
for
a
renewal
of
the
easy
careless
mood
of
days
were
dismayed
to
find
this
was
impossible
others
who
had
allowed
an
optimistic
idealism
to
prophesy
a
new
age
looked
about
them
bewilderingly
and
in
vain
for
signs
of
its
fair
birth
the
latter
to
whom
perhaps
fillery
belonged
were
more
bitterly
disappointed
more
cruelly
shocked
than
the
former
the
race
it
seemed
to
many
unshirking
eyes
had
leaped
back
centuries
at
a
single
spring
the
gulf
of
primal
savagery
which
had
gaped
wide
open
for
five
years
proving
the
stone
age
close
beneath
the
surface
of
civilization
had
not
yet
fully
closed
its
jaws
still
dripped
blood
hatred
selfishness
the
race
was
still
dislocated
by
the
convincing
disproof
of
progress
horrified
at
the
fierce
reality
which
had
displaced
the
coloured
dream
it
had
been
complacently
worshipping
hitherto
men
in
the
mass
undoubtedly
were
savages
still
to
fillery
an
honest
though
not
a
necessarily
fundamental
pessimism
seemed
justified
he
believed
in
progress
still
but
as
his
habit
was
he
faced
the
facts
his
attitude
lost
something
of
its
original
enthusiasm
looking
about
him
he
saw
no
big
constructive
movement
the
figure
who
more
than
any
other
was
altering
the
face
of
the
world
with
his
ideas
as
well
as
his
armies
was
avowedly
destructive
only
he
found
himself
a
sobered
and
a
saddened
man
his
private
home
having
accomplished
splendid
work
had
just
discharged
its
last
patient
it
was
now
empty
again
the
staff
carefully
chosen
and
proved
by
long
service
dismissed
on
holidays
the
building
itself
renovated
and
repaired
against
the
arrival
later
of
new
patients
that
were
expected
devonham
his
assistant
away
for
a
period
of
rest
in
switzerland
would
be
back
in
a
week
or
two
and
fillery
before
resuming
his
normal
work
found
himself
with
little
to
do
but
watch
the
progress
of
the
cleaners
painters
and
carpenters
at
work
into
this
brief
time
of
leisure
dropped
the
strange
perplexing
letter
with
an
effect
distinctly
stimulating
it
promised
an
unusual
case
a
patient
if
patient
the
case
referred
to
could
properly
be
called
a
young
man
who
if
you
decide
after
careful
reflection
to
reject
can
be
looked
after
only
by
the
state
which
means
of
course
an
asylum
for
the
insane
i
know
you
are
no
longer
head
of
the
establishment
in
liverpool
but
that
you
confine
yourself
to
private
work
along
similar
lines
though
upon
a
smaller
scale
and
that
you
welcome
only
cases
that
have
been
given
up
as
hopeless
i
honour
your
courage
and
your
sympathy
i
know
your
skill
so
far
as
a
cure
is
conceivable
this
one
is
hopeless
certainly
but
its
unusual
indeed
its
unique
character
entitles
it
i
believe
to
be
placed
among
your
chosen
few
love
sympathy
patience
combined
with
the
closest
observation
it
urgently
demands
and
these
qualities
associated
with
unrivalled
skill
you
must
allow
me
again
to
think
you
alone
possess
among
healers
and
helpers
of
strange
minds
for
over
twenty
years
in
the
solitudes
of
these
jura
forests
and
mountains
i
have
cared
for
him
as
best
i
could
and
with
a
devotion
a
child
of
my
own
might
have
expected
but
now
my
end
not
far
away
i
can
not
leave
him
behind
me
here
uncared
for
yet
the
alternative
the
impersonal
and
formal
care
of
an
institute
must
break
my
heart
and
his
i
turn
to
you
my
advanced
age
and
growing
infirmities
in
these
days
of
unkind
travel
prohibit
my
bringing
him
over
can
your
great
heart
suggest
a
means
since
i
feel
sure
you
will
not
refuse
the
care
of
this
strange
being
whose
nature
and
peculiarities
indicate
your
especial
care
and
yours
alone
is
it
too
much
to
wonder
if
you
yourself
could
come
and
see
him
here
in
the
remote
mountain
châlet
where
i
have
tended
and
cared
for
him
ever
since
his
mother
died
in
bearing
him
over
twenty
years
ago
i
have
taught
him
what
seemed
wise
and
best
i
have
guarded
and
observed
him
he
knows
little
or
nothing
of
an
outside
world
of
men
and
women
and
is
ignorant
of
life
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
what
precisely
he
may
be
to
what
stratum
of
consciousness
he
belongs
what
kind
of
being
he
is
i
mean
the
last
two
lines
were
then
scored
through
though
left
legible
i
feel
with
arago
that
he
is
a
rash
man
who
pronounces
the
word
anywhere
outside
the
sphere
of
pure
mathematics
more
sentences
were
here
scored
through
dare
i
say
to
you
as
master
teacher
great
soul
that
to
life
as
we
know
it
he
does
not
perhaps
belong
in
writing
in
this
letter
i
find
it
impossible
to
give
you
full
details
i
had
intended
to
set
them
down
my
pen
refuses
in
the
plain
english
at
my
disposal
well
simply
it
is
not
credible
but
i
have
kept
full
notes
all
these
years
and
the
notes
belong
to
you
i
enclose
an
imperfect
painting
i
made
of
him
some
four
years
ago
i
am
no
artist
for
background
you
must
imagine
what
lay
beyond
my
little
skill
the
blazing
glory
of
the
immense
that
he
loves
to
make
upon
the
open
mountain
side
usually
at
dawn
after
a
night
of
prayer
and
singing
while
waiting
for
the
strange
power
he
derives
as
we
all
do
indeed
at
second
or
third
hand
from
the
worship
of
what
is
to
him
his
mighty
father
the
sun
wind
as
the
of
the
sun
he
worships
too
both
sun
and
wind
that
is
produce
an
unusual
state
approaching
ecstasy
counting
upon
you
i
have
hypnotized
him
suggesting
that
he
forget
all
the
immediate
past
in
fact
to
date
and
telling
him
he
will
like
you
in
place
of
me
though
with
him
it
is
an
uncertain
method
i
am
now
old
in
years
i
have
lived
and
loved
suffered
and
dreamed
like
most
of
us
my
hands
have
been
warmed
at
the
fires
of
life
of
which
let
me
add
i
am
not
ignorant
you
have
known
i
believe
my
serious
as
also
my
lighter
imaginative
books
my
occasional
correspondence
with
your
colleague
paul
devonham
has
been
of
help
and
guidance
to
me
we
are
not
therefore
wholly
strangers
the
twenty
years
spent
in
these
solitudes
among
simple
peasant
folk
with
a
single
object
of
devotion
to
fill
my
days
have
been
i
would
tell
you
among
the
best
of
my
long
existence
my
renouncement
of
the
world
was
no
renouncement
i
am
enriched
with
wonder
and
experience
that
amaze
me
for
the
world
holds
possibilities
few
have
ever
dreamed
of
and
that
i
myself
filled
as
i
am
with
the
memory
of
their
contemplation
can
hardly
credit
even
now
perhaps
in
an
earlier
stage
of
evolution
as
delboeuf
believes
man
was
fully
aware
of
that
went
on
within
himself
a
region
since
closed
to
us
owing
to
attention
being
increasingly
directed
outwards
into
some
such
region
i
have
had
a
glimpse
it
seems
i
feel
sometimes
there
was
as
much
fact
as
fancy
perhaps
in
the
wise
old
hebrew
who
stated
poetically
recently
too
compared
with
the
stretch
of
time
my
science
deals
with
sons
of
god
took
to
themselves
daughters
of
the
children
of
men
the
letter
here
broke
off
as
though
interrupted
by
something
unexpected
and
unusual
it
was
signed
indeed
john
mason
but
signed
in
pencil
and
at
the
bottom
of
an
unwritten
blank
sheet
it
had
not
all
been
written
either
at
one
time
or
on
the
same
day
there
were
intervals
evidently
perhaps
of
hours
perhaps
of
days
between
the
paragraphs
fillery
read
then
read
again
the
strange
epistle
coming
each
time
to
the
same
conclusion
the
writer
was
dying
in
the
very
act
of
forming
the
last
sentences
their
incoherence
the
alteration
in
the
style
were
thus
explained
he
had
felt
the
end
of
life
so
close
that
he
had
written
his
signature
probably
addressed
the
envelope
as
well
knowing
the
page
might
never
be
filled
up
it
had
not
been
filled
up
something
behind
the
phrases
behind
the
intensity
of
the
actual
words
beyond
the
queer
touches
that
revealed
a
mind
betrayed
by
solitude
the
hints
possibly
of
a
deluded
intelligence
there
was
something
that
rang
true
and
stimulated
him
more
than
ordinarily
the
reference
to
devonham
too
was
definite
enough
fillery
remembered
vaguely
a
correspondence
during
recent
crowded
years
with
a
man
named
mason
living
away
in
switzerland
somewhere
and
that
devonham
had
asked
him
questions
from
time
to
time
about
what
he
called
with
his
and
classification
pagan
obsession
worshipper
of
fire
and
wind
referring
it
to
the
writer
of
the
letters
named
john
mason
delusion
he
had
also
called
it
sometimes
they
had
come
to
refer
to
it
he
remembered
as
in
fact
he
now
looked
up
those
notes
for
the
mention
of
the
books
caused
him
an
uncomfortable
feeling
of
neglected
opportunity
and
john
mason
was
an
honoured
name
you
know
i
believe
my
books
the
writer
said
could
this
be
he
asked
himself
anxiously
john
mason
the
eminent
geologist
had
devonham
not
realized
who
he
was
must
he
blame
his
assistant
whose
jealous
care
and
judgment
saved
him
so
many
foolish
futile
cases
reserving
what
was
significant
and
important
only
the
notes
established
his
mistakes
and
his
assistant
perhaps
intentional
ignorance
the
writer
of
this
curious
letter
was
unquestionably
the
author
of
those
fairy
books
for
children
old
and
young
whose
daring
speculations
had
suggested
that
other
types
and
races
ages
even
before
the
neanderthal
man
had
dwelt
side
by
side
with
what
is
known
as
modern
man
upon
this
planet
behind
the
literary
form
of
legend
and
fairy
tale
however
lay
a
curious
conviction
atlantis
was
of
yesterday
compared
with
earlier
civilizations
now
extinct
by
fire
and
flood
and
general
upheaval
which
once
may
have
inhabited
the
globe
the
present
evolutionary
system
buttressed
by
darwin
and
the
rest
was
but
a
little
recent
insignificant
series
trivial
both
in
time
and
space
when
set
beside
the
mightier
systems
that
had
come
and
gone
their
evidence
he
found
not
in
clumsy
fossils
and
footprints
on
cooled
rocks
but
in
the
of
those
who
had
followed
and
eventually
survived
them
memories
of
titan
wars
and
mighty
beings
and
gods
and
goddesses
of
kind
to
whose
different
existence
the
physical
conditions
of
an
planet
presented
no
impossibility
the
human
species
this
trumpery
limited
man
was
not
the
only
type
of
being
yet
john
mason
in
his
day
had
held
the
chair
at
edinburgh
university
his
lectures
embodied
and
knowledge
with
acutest
imaginative
insight
his
earliest
writings
were
the
of
the
time
his
name
when
edward
fillery
was
medical
student
there
still
hovered
like
incense
above
the
towers
the
notes
now
intrigued
him
no
blame
attached
to
devonham
for
having
missed
the
cue
devonham
could
not
know
everything
geology
was
not
in
his
line
of
work
and
knowledge
and
mason
was
a
common
name
rather
he
blamed
himself
for
not
having
been
struck
by
the
oddness
of
the
case
the
mason
letters
the
pagan
obsession
worshipper
of
wind
and
fire
the
strange
a
competent
indexer
at
any
rate
he
said
to
himself
with
a
smile
as
he
turned
up
the
details
easily
these
were
very
scanty
devonham
evidently
had
deemed
the
case
of
questionable
value
the
letters
from
mason
with
the
answers
to
them
he
could
not
find
the
slight
record
was
headed
john
followed
by
an
address
chez
henri
petavel
peasant
jura
mountains
vaud
french
switzerland
and

how
to
reach
this
apparently
remote
valley
by
mule
and
carriage
and
name
of
mason
protégé
not
given
age
born
parentage
couple
of
mystical
temperament
sincere
but
suffering
from
marked
delusions
believers
in
magic
various
but
chiefly
concerned
with
nature
and
natural
forces
once
known
forgotten
of
immense
potency
accessible
to
certain
practices
of
logical
but
undetailed
kind
able
apparently
to
intensify
human
consciousness
of
extremely
quick
intelligence
yet
betrays
ignorance
of
human
conditions
intelligence
superior
to
human
though
sometimes
inferior
long
periods
of
quiescence
followed
by
immense
almost
activity
and
energy
worships
fire
and
air
chiefly
the
former
calling
the
sun
his
father
and
deity
abhors
confined
space
this
shown
by
intense
desire
for
heat
which
together
with
free
space
air
seem
conditions
of
fears
as
in
claustrophobia
both
water
and
solidity
anything
massive
has
great
physical
power
yet
indifferent
to
its
use
women
irresistibly
attracted
to
him
but
his
attitude
towards
other
sex
seems
one
of
gentleness
and
pity
love
means
nothing
has
on
the
other
hand
extraordinarily
high
ideal
of
service
is
puzzled
by
quarrels
and
differences
of
personal
kind
of
vast
system
of
myriad
workers
ruled
by
this
ideal
of
harmonious
service
faithful
true
honest
falseness
or
lies
impossible
lovable
pathetic
helpless
type
the
notes
broke
off
abruptly
fillery
wondering
a
little
that
his
subordinate
brief
but
suggestive
summary
had
never
been
brought
to
his
notice
before
turned
a
moment
to
glance
at
the
rough
drawing
he
held
in
his
hand
he
looked
at
it
for
some
moments
with
absorption
the
expression
of
his
face
was
enigmatical
he
was
more
than
surprised
that
devonham
had
not
drawn
his
attention
to
the
case
in
detail
placing
his
hand
so
as
to
hide
the
lower
portion
of
the
face
he
examined
the
eyes
then
turned
the
portrait
upside
down
gazing
at
the
eyes
afresh
he
seemed
lost
in
thought
for
a
considerable
time
a
faint
flush
stole
into
his
cheek
and
a
careful
observer
might
have
noticed
an
increase
of
light
about
the
skin
he
sighed
once
or
twice
and
presently
laying
the
portrait
down
again
he
turned
back
to
the
upon
the
table
in
front
of
him
very
accurate
and
careful
he
said
to
himself
with
satisfaction
as
he
noticed
the
date
devonham
had
set
against
the
entries
june
the
war
therefore
had
interrupted
the
correspondence
devonham
had
made
further
notes
of
his
own
in
the
margin
here
and
there
does
this
originate
primarily
from
mason
mind
communicated
thence
to
his
protégé
he
agreed
with
his
assistant
query
if
so
was
it
transferred
to
mason
mind
before
that
by
the
father
or
mother
the
mother
was
obviously
his
mason
great
love
yet
the
father
was
his
life
friend
mason
great
passion
was
suppressed
he
never
told
it
it
found
no
outlet
admirable
was
the
comment
spoken
below
his
breath
boy
born
as
result
of
some
experiment
intensely
believed
not
stated
in
detail
during
course
of
which
father
died
suddenly
mason
tended
mother
then
lived
alone
in
remote
place
where
all
had
occurred
did
mason
inherit
entire
content
of
parents
beliefs
dramatizing
this
by
force
of
unexpressed
but
passionate
love
did
not
mason
mind
thus
charged
communicate
whole
business
to
the
young
mind
he
has
since
formed
a
plastic
mind
uninfluenced
by
normal
human
surroundings
and
conditions
of
ordinary
life
transfer
of
a
mania
then
followed
another
note
summarizing
evidently
devonham
judgment
not
worth
investigation
until
examined
further
look
up
mason
first
opportunity
and
judge
at
first
hand
fillery
glancing
from
the
papers
to
the
portrait
smiled
a
little
again
as
he
signified
approval
but
the
last
entry
interested
him
still
more
it
was
dated
july
mason
reports
boy
prophecy
of
great
upheaval
coming
entire
race
slips
back
into
chaos
of
primitive
life
again
entire
western
civilization
crumbles
modern
inventions
and
knowledge
vanish
nature
spirits
reappear
desires
return
of
all
previous
letters
these
sent
by
registered
post
a
few
scattered
notes
on
separate
sheets
of
paper
lay
at
the
end
of
the
carefully
typed
but
these
were
very
incomplete
and
devonham
handwriting
especially
when
in
pencil
was
not
of
the
clearest
claim
though
absurd
not
traceable
to
any
antecedent
causes
given
by
letters
what
is
mason
past
mental
and
temperamental
history
is
he
not
through
the
parents
the
cause
mania
seems
harmless
both
to
subject
and
others
no
suffering
or
unhappiness
therefore
not
a
case
for
until
further
examined
by
self
better
see
mason
and
his
subject
first
wrote
july
proposing
visit
fillery
eyes
twinkled
his
forehead
relaxed
he
looked
back
he
remembered
details
devonham
holiday
that
year
he
recalled
was
due
on
august
he
had
intended
going
out
mountain
climbing
in
switzerland
the
final
note
of
all
also
in
writing
seemed
to
refer
to
the
treatment
mason
had
asked
advice
about
and
the
line
devonham
had
suggested
natural
life
close
to
nature
can
not
hurt
him
but
i
advise
watch
him
with
fire
and
with
heights
heat
air
that
is
he
may
decide
his
physical
body
is
irksome
and
seek
to
escape
it
teach
him
natural
history
botany
geology
insects
animals
even
astronomy
but
always
giving
him
reasons
and
explanations
let
him
meet
girls
of
his
own
age
and
fall
in
love
fullest
natural
expression
but
guarded
without
his
knowing
it
for
a
long
time
fillery
sat
with
the
notes
and
papers
before
him
thinking
over
what
he
had
read
devonham
advice
was
clever
enough
but
without
insight
sound
and
astute
yet
lacking
divination
the
twinkle
in
his
eyes
caused
by
the
final
entry
died
away
his
face
was
grave
his
manner
preoccupied
intense
he
gazed
long
at
the
portrait
in
his
hand
it
was
dusk
when
he
finally
rose
replaced
the
locked
the
cabinet
and
went
out
into
another
room
and
thence
into
the
hall
taking
his
hat
and
stick
he
left
the
house
already
composing
in
his
mind
the
telegram
instructing
devonham
while
apologizing
for
the
interrupted
holiday
to
bring
the
subject
of
the
notes
to
england
with
him
a
telegraph
girl
met
him
on
the
very
steps
of
the
house
he
took
the
envelope
from
her
and
opened
it
he
read
the
message
it
was
dated
bâle
the
day
before
arriving
end
week
with
interesting
patient
details

devonham
chapter
v
it
was
however
some
two
weeks
later
before
fillery
was
on
his
way
to
the
station
to
meet
devonham
and
his
companion
a
slight
delay
caused
apparently
by
the
necessity
of
buying
an
outfit
had
intervened
and
given
time
for
an
exchange
of
letters
but
devonham
had
contented
himself
chiefly
with
telegrams
he
did
not
wish
his
chief
to
know
too
much
about
the
case
in
advance
probably
he
regrets
the
notes
already
thought
the
doctor
as
the
car
made
its
way
slowly
across
crowded
london
he
wants
my
first
unbiased
judgment
he
right
of
course
but
it
too
late
for
that
now
the
delay
however
had
been
of
value
the
home
was
in
working
order
again
the
staff
returned
the
private
suite
all
ready
for
its
interesting
occupant
whom
in
thought
he
had
already
named
for
in
the
first
place
he
did
not
know
his
name
as
yet
and
in
the
second
he
felt
towards
him
a
certain
attitude
of
tolerant
scepticism
cut
off
from
his
own
kind
for
so
many
years
educated
perhaps
only
by
too
speculative
and
imaginative
a
mind
equally
warped
by
this
long
solitude
a
mind
unduly
stretched
by
the
contemplation
of
immense
geological
perspectives
filled
too
with
heaven
knows
what
strange
stories
of
pantheistic
might
be
distinctly
interesting
but
hardly
all
that
mason
had
thought
him
unique
was
a
word
rarely
justified
the
peculiarities
would
prove
to
be
mere
extravagances
that
had
of
necessity
remained
uncorrected
by
the
friction
of
intercourse
with
his
own
kind
the
rest
was
inheritance
equally
unpruned
a
mind
living
in
a
a
backwater
with
nature
at
the
same
time
fillery
admitted
a
certain
anticipatory
excitement
he
could
not
wholly
account
for
an
undercurrent
of
wonder
he
ascribed
to
his
khaketian
blood
he
had
written
once
only
to
his
assistant
sending
briefest
instructions
to
say
the
rooms
would
be
ready
and
that
the
young
man
must
believe
he
was
an
invited
guest
coming
on
a
visit
let
him
expect
complete
freedom
of
movement
and
occupation
without
the
smallest
idea
of
restraint
in
any
way
he
is
merely
coming
to
stay
for
as
long
as
he
pleases
with
a
friend
of
mason
impress
him
with
a
sense
of
hearty
welcome
and
devonham
replying
had
evidently
understood
the
wisdom
of
this
method
he
is
also
greatly
pleased
with
your
name
the
sound
of
it
was
stated
in
the
one
letter
that
he
wrote
and
as
names
mean
a
lot
to
him
so
much
the
better
the
sound
of
it
gives
him
pleasure
he
keeps
repeating
it
over
to
himself
he
already
likes
you
my
name
he
does
not
care
about
saying
it
quickly
sharply
but
he
trusts
me
his
trust
in
anyone
who
shows
him
kindness
is
instantaneous
and
complete
he
invariably
expects
kindness
however
from
everyone
gives
it
himself
equally
and
is
baffled
and
puzzled
by
any
other
treatment
so
devonham
with
who
attached
importance
to
names
and
expected
kindness
from
people
as
a
natural
thing
would
be
in
london
town
within
the
hour
straight
from
his
forests
and
mountains
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
would
find
himself
in
the
heart
of
the
greatest
accumulation
of
human
beings
on
the
planet
the
first
city
of
the
world
the
final
expression
of
civilization
as
known
to
the
human
race
in
london
town
thought
fillery
his
mouth
twitching
with
the
smile
that
began
in
his
quiet
eyes
bless
the
lad
we
must
make
him
feel
at
home
and
happy
he
shall
indeed
have
kindness
need
a
woman
touch
as
well
he
reflected
a
moment
women
are
a
great
help
in
doubtful
cases
the
way
a
man
reacts
to
them
he
mused
only
they
must
be
distinct
in
type
to
be
of
value
and
his
mind
ran
quickly
comprehensively
over
the
women
of
his
acquaintance
pausing
as
it
did
so
upon
two
in
particular
a
certain
lady
gleeson
and
iraida
sometimes
called
nayan
khilkoff
the
daughter
of
his
russian
friend
the
sculptor
his
mind
pondered
for
some
moments
the
two
he
had
selected
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
made
use
of
them
their
effect
respectively
upon
a
man
was
invariably
instinctive
and
illuminating
the
two
were
radically
different
feminine
types
as
far
removed
from
one
another
as
pole
from
pole
yet
each
essentially
of
her
sex
their
effect
respectively
upon
such
a
youth
must
be
of
value
and
might
be
even
illuminating
to
the
point
of
revelation
both
he
felt
sure
would
not
be
indifferent
to
the
new
personality
it
was
however
of
nayan
khilkoff
that
he
thought
chiefly
of
that
rare
selfless
maternal
type
which
men
in
all
ages
have
called
saint
or
angel
she
possessed
that
power
which
evoked
in
them
all
they
could
feel
of
respect
of
purity
of
chivalry
that
love
in
a
word
which
holds
as
a
chief
ingredient
worship
her
beauty
beyond
their
reach
was
of
the
stars
it
was
the
unattainable
in
her
they
loved
her
beauty
was
of
the
soul
nayan
was
spiritual
not
as
a
result
of
painful
effort
and
laborious
development
but
born
so
her
life
moreover
was
one
of
natural
service
personal
love
exclusive
devotion
to
an
individual
concentration
of
her
being
upon
another
single
being
this
seemed
impossible
to
her
she
was
at
the
same
time
an
enigma
there
was
an
elusive
flavour
about
her
that
made
people
a
little
in
awe
of
her
a
flavour
not
of
this
earth
quite
she
carried
an
impersonal
attitude
almost
to
the
point
of
seeming
irresponsive
to
common
human
things
and
interests
the
other
woman
lady
gleeson
angela
her
christian
name
was
equally
a
simple
type
though
her
simplicity
was
that
of
the
primitive
female
who
is
still
close
to
the
stone
age
a
savage
she
adorned
herself
to
capture
men
she
was
the
female
spider
that
devours
its
mates
she
wanted
slaves
to
describe
her
as
selfish
were
inadequate
for
she
was
unaware
that
any
other
ideal
existed
in
life
but
that
of
obtaining
her
own
pleasure
there
was
instinct
and
emotion
but
of
course
no
heart
without
morals
conscience
or
consideration
she
was
the
animal
of
prey
that
obeys
the
call
of
hunger
in
the
most
direct
way
possible
regardless
of
consequences
to
herself
or
others
her
brain
was
quick
her
personality
shallow
when
talking
she
rattled
on
devonham
had
well
said
once
you
can
hear
her
two
thoughts
clicking
both
of
them
in
trousers
sir
george
recently
knighted
successful
with
large
concessions
in
china
was
indulgent
the
male
splendour
of
the
youth
was
bound
to
stimulate
her
hunger
as
his
simplicity
his
loneliness
and
in
a
sense
his
pathetic
helplessness
would
certainly
evoke
the
tenderness
in
nayan
he
probably
like
her
dear
ridiculous
name
too
fillery
felt
the
nickname
they
gave
her
because
she
the
same
to
everybody
whichever
way
you
take
her
nayan
khilkoff
yet
her
real
name
was
more
beautiful
iraida
and
as
he
repeated
it
half
aloud
a
soft
light
stole
upon
his
face
shone
in
the
deep
clear
eyes
and
touched
even
the
corners
of
the
rather
grim
mouth
with
another
a
tenderer
expression
before
the
sternness
quickly
returned
to
it
would
meet
thus
two
main
types
of
female
life
he
apparently
an
exceedingly
male
being
would
face
the
onslaught
of
passion
and
heart
of
lust
and
love
respectively
and
it
was
his
reactions
to
these
onslaughts
that
fillery
wished
to
observe
they
would
help
his
diagnosis
they
might
guide
his
treatment
it
was
a
warm
and
muggy
afternoon
the
twilight
passing
rapidly
into
darkness
now
one
of
those
late
autumn
days
when
summer
heat
flits
back
but
light
is
weak
the
covered
sky
increased
the
clammy
warmth
which
was
damp
unhealthy
devitalizing
no
wind
stirred
the
great
city
was
sticky
and
depressing
yet
people
approved
the
heat
although
it
tired
them
it
shortens
the
winter
anyhow
was
the
general
verdict
when
expressed
at
all
they
referred
unconsciously
to
the
general
dread
of
strikes
london
was
hurried
and
confused
an
air
of
feverish
overcrowding
reigned
in
the
great
station
when
he
left
the
car
and
went
in
on
foot
no
sign
of
order
system
direction
was
visible
the
scene
might
have
been
a
first
rehearsal
of
some
entirely
new
experiment
grumbling
and
complaint
rose
from
all
sides
in
an
exasperated
chorus
he
tried
to
ascertain
how
late
the
train
was
and
on
which
platform
it
might
be
expected
but
no
one
knew
for
certain
and
the
grudging
replies
to
questions
seemed
to
say
you
no
right
to
ask
anything
and
if
you
keep
on
asking
there
will
be
a
strike
so
that
that
he
listened
to
the
talk
and
watched
the
facial
expressions
and
the
movements
of
the
and
concourse
of
london
citizens
the
clock
was
accurate
and
everyone
was
kind
to
ladies
stewed
tea
stale
cake
with
little
stones
in
it
vile
whisky
and
very
weak
beer
were
obtainable
at
high
prices
there
were
no
matches
the
machine
for
supplying
was
broken
he
saw
men
paying
more
thought
and
attention
to
the
comfort
of
their
dogs
than
to
their
own
the
great
marvellous
stupid
splendid
race
was
puzzled
and
exasperated
then
suddenly
the
train
pulled
in
full
of
returned
exiles
longing
to
be
back
again
in
dear
old
england
thank
god
it
come
sighed
the
crowd
good
we
english
forgive
and
forget
and
prepared
to
tip
the
porters
handsomely
and
carry
their
own
baggage
the
confusion
that
followed
was
equally
characteristic
and
equally
remarkable
displaying
greatness
side
by
side
with
its
defects
there
was
no
system
all
was
muddled
yet
all
was
safe
anyone
could
claim
what
luggage
they
liked
though
no
one
did
so
nor
dreamed
it
seemed
of
doing
so
there
was
an
air
of
decent
honesty
and
trust
there
were
ladies
who
discovered
that
all
men
are
savages
there
were
men
and
women
who
were
savages
people
shook
hands
warmly
smiled
with
honest
affection
said
light
careless
that
hid
genuine
emotion
helped
one
another
with
parcels
offered
one
another
lifts
there
were
few
taxicabs
one
perhaps
to
every
thirty
people
and
in
this
general
scrimmage
fillery
at
first
could
see
no
sign
of
his
expected
arrivals
he
walked
from
end
to
end
of
the
platform
littered
with
luggage
and
thronged
with
bustling
people
but
nowhere
could
he
discover
the
familiar
outline
of
devonham
nor
anyone
who
answered
to
the
strange
picture
that
already
stood
forth
sharply
in
his
mind
there
been
a
mistake
somewhere
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
find
a
telegram
when
i
get
back
to
the
house
explaining
it
when
suddenly
and
without
apparent
cause
there
stole
upon
him
a
curious
lift
of
freedom
a
sharp
sense
of
open
spaces
he
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
it
was
accompanied
by
an
increase
of
light
for
a
second
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
great
enclosing
roof
had
rolled
back
and
blown
away
letting
in
air
and
some
lost
ray
of
sunshine
a
lovely
valley
flitted
across
his
thought
almost
he
was
aware
of
flowers
of
music
of
rhythmic
movement
edward
there
you
are
i
thought
you
had
come
he
heard
close
behind
him
and
turning
saw
the
figure
of
devonham
calm
and
alert
as
usual
at
his
side
stood
a
lean
virile
outline
of
a
young
man
topping
devonham
by
several
inches
with
broad
but
thin
shoulders
figure
erect
yet
flexible
whose
shining
and
inquiring
eyes
of
blue
were
the
most
striking
feature
in
a
boyish
face
where
strength
intensity
and
radiant
health
combined
in
an
unusual
degree
here
is
our
friend
levallon
added
devonham
but
not
before
the
figure
had
stepped
lightly
and
quickly
forward
already
staring
at
him
and
shaking
his
outstretched
hand
so
this
was
and
levallon
was
his
name
the
calm
searching
eyes
held
a
touch
of
bewilderment
in
them
the
eyes
of
an
honest
intelligent
animal
thought
fillery
quickly
adding
in
spite
of
himself
and
almost
simultaneously
but
of
a
divine
animal
it
was
a
look
he
had
never
in
his
life
before
encountered
in
any
human
eyes
mason
sketch
had
caught
something
at
least
of
their
innocence
and
question
of
their
odd
directness
and
intensity
something
too
of
the
golden
fire
in
the
hair
he
wore
a
felt
hat
of
swiss
pattern
a
bernese
overcoat
a
low
shirt
with
blue
tie
to
match
buffeted
and
pushed
by
the
frenzied
travellers
they
stood
and
faced
each
other
shaking
hands
eyes
looking
into
eyes
two
strangers
doctor
and
patient
possibly
but
friends
most
certainly
both
felt
instantly
they
liked
one
another
once
again
the
scent
of
flowers
danced
with
light
above
the
heaps
of
trunks
rugs
packages
a
cool
wind
from
mountains
seemed
to
blow
across
the
dreadful
station
you
arrived
safely
began
fillery
a
little
taken
aback
perhaps
welcome
and
not
too
tired
i
hope
when
the
other
interrupted
him
in
a
man
deep
voice
full
of
pleasant
timbre
he
said
making
the
f
sound
rather
long
i
need
you
to
see
you
makes
me
happy
tired
put
in
devonham
breathlessly
good
heavens
not
he
but
i
am
now
for
a
porter
and
the
big
luggage
have
you
got
a
taxi
the
car
is
here
said
fillery
letting
go
with
a
certain
reluctance
the
hand
he
held
and
paying
little
attention
to
anything
but
the
figure
before
him
who
used
such
unexpected
language
what
was
it
what
did
it
mean
whence
came
this
sudden
sense
of
intensity
light
of
order
system
intelligence
into
the
racial
scene
of
muddled
turmoil
all
about
him
there
seemed
an
air
of
speeding
up
in
thought
and
action
near
him
compared
to
which
the
slow
stupidity
and
confused
on
all
sides
became
painful
gross
and
even
ludicrous
someone
bumped
against
him
with
violence
but
quite
needlessly
since
the
simplest
judgment
of
weight
and
distance
could
have
avoided
the
collision
in
such
ordinary
small
details
he
was
aware
of
another
a
higher
standard
close
a
man
on
his
left
trying
to
manage
several
bundles
appeared
vividly
as
of
amazing
incompetence
with
his
miscalculation
his
clumsy
movement
his
hopeless
inability
to
judge
cause
and
effect
yet
he
had
two
arms
ten
fingers
two
legs
broad
shoulders
and
deep
chest
misdirection
of
his
great
strength
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
manage
the
assortment
of
light
parcels
next
to
him
however
stood
a
woman
carrying
a
baby
there
was
no
error
there
the
panting
engine
just
beyond
them
again
set
a
standard
of
contemptuous
impersonal
intelligence
that
obeying
nature
laws
dwarfed
the
humans
generally
but
it
was
another
a
standard
that
had
flashed
to
him
above
all
in
some
curious
way
the
competent
dead
machinery
that
obeyed
the
law
with
faultless
efficiency
and
the
woman
obeying
instinct
with
equally
unconscious
skill
these
two
energies
were
akin
to
the
new
standard
he
was
now
startlingly
aware
of
he
looked
up
as
though
to
trace
this
sudden
new
consciousness
of
bright
quick
rapid
competence
almost
as
of
some
immense
power
building
with
consistent
scheme
and
system
that
had
occurred
to
him
and
he
met
again
the
direct
yet
slightly
bewildered
eyes
that
watched
him
watched
him
with
confidence
sweetness
and
with
a
questioning
intensity
he
found
intriguing
captivating
and
oddly
stimulating
he
felt
happiness
by
yer
leave
roared
a
porter
as
they
stepped
aside
just
in
time
to
save
being
pushed
by
the
laden
truck
just
in
time
to
save
himself
that
is
for
the
other
fillery
noticed
moved
like
a
chamois
on
its
native
rocks
so
surely
lightly
swiftly
was
he
poised
this
ah
you
must
excuse
it
the
doctor
exclaimed
with
a
smile
of
apology
almost
we
not
yet
had
time
to
settle
down
after
the
war
you
see
he
pointed
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
to
the
roaring
cavern
where
confusion
reigned
supreme
the
of
travel
in
the
biggest
city
of
the
empire
i
got
a
porter
cried
devonham
beckoning
vigorously
a
little
further
down
the
platform
you
wait
there
i
be
along
in
a
minute
with
the
stuff
he
was
hot
flustered
exhausted
you
struggle
it
was
like
this
all
the
way
is
there
no
knowledge
levallon
asked
in
his
deep
quiet
tones
we
do
said
fillery
with
us
life
is
always
struggle
but
there
is
more
system
than
appears
the
confusion
is
chiefly
on
the
surface
it
is
dark
and
there
is
so
little
air
observed
the
other
and
they
all
work
against
each
other
fillery
laughed
into
the
other
eyes
they
laughed
together
and
it
seemed
suddenly
to
the
doctor
that
their
beings
somehow
merged
so
that
for
a
second
he
knew
the
entire
content
of
his
mind
as
if
there
was
nothing
in
levallon
he
did
not
understand
you
are
a
builder
levallon
said
abruptly
but
as
he
said
it
his
companion
caught
on
the
wing
as
it
were
another
meaning
he
became
curiously
aware
of
the
smallness
of
the
remote
insignificance
of
the
little
planet
whereon
this
dialogue
took
place
yet
at
the
same
time
of
its
superb
seductive
loveliness
in
him
rose
a
feeling
as
on
wings
that
he
was
not
chained
in
his
familiar
daily
personality
but
that
an
immense
delicious
freedom
lay
within
reach
he
could
be
everywhere
at
once
he
could
do
everything
wait
here
while
i
help
devonham
then
we
get
into
the
car
and
be
off
he
moved
away
threading
a
path
with
difficulty
i
wait
in
peace
i
am
happy
was
the
reply
and
with
those
few
phrases
uttered
in
the
quiet
deep
voice
sounding
in
his
ears
and
in
his
very
blood
the
older
man
went
towards
the
spot
where
devonham
struggled
with
a
porter
a
pile
of
nondescript
luggage
and
a
truck
i
wait
in
peace
you
struggle
you
work
against
each
other
it
is
dark
there
is
little
air
you
are
a
builder
but
not
these
singular
words
alone
remained
alive
in
his
mind
there
remained
in
his
heart
the
sense
of
that
vitality
of
open
spaces
keen
air
and
brighter
light
he
had
experienced
and
with
it
the
security
of
some
higher
faultless
standard
his
brain
indeed
had
recognized
a
consciousness
of
swifter
reactions
of
surer
movements
of
more
intelligent
compared
to
which
the
people
about
him
behaved
like
stupid
almost
like
beings
the
one
exception
being
the
instinctive
action
of
the
mother
in
carrying
her
baby
and
the
other
the
impersonal
accurate
competence
of
the
dead
machinery
but
more
than
this
reasoned
change
there
burned
suddenly
in
his
heart
an
inexplicable
exhilaration
and
brightness
a
wonder
that
he
could
attribute
only
to
another
mode
of
life
his
khaketian
blood
he
knew
might
be
responsible
for
part
of
it
but
not
for
all
the
invigorating
mountain
wind
the
sunlight
the
rhythmic
sound
the
scent
of
wild
flowers
these
were
his
own
personal
interpretations
of
a
quickened
sense
he
could
not
analyse
as
yet
as
he
held
the
young
man
hand
as
he
gazed
into
his
direct
blue
eyes
this
sense
had
increased
in
intensity
levallon
had
some
marvellous
quality
or
power
that
was
new
to
him
while
yet
not
entirely
unfamiliar
what
was
it
and
how
did
the
youth
perceive
this
sense
in
him
so
surely
that
he
took
its
presence
for
granted
accepted
even
played
upon
it
he
experienced
as
it
were
a
brilliant
intensification
of
spirit
some
portion
of
him
already
knew
exactly
what
levallon
was
across
the
ugly
turmoil
and
confusion
of
the
huge
dingy
railway
terminus
had
moved
wondrously
some
simple
power
that
brought
in
beauty
some
very
deep
and
ancient
conception
had
touched
him
and
gone
its
way
again
the
stupendous
beauty
of
a
simple
common
day
appeared
to
him
his
subconscious
being
of
course
was
deeply
stirred
that
was
the
truth
phrase
it
as
he
might
his
heart
was
lifted
as
by
a
primal
wind
at
dawn
upon
some
mountain
top
the
heaviness
of
the
day
was
gone
fatigue
too
vanished
the
civilized
folk
appeared
contemptible
and
stupid
something
direct
from
nature
herself
poured
through
him
and
it
was
from
the
atmosphere
of
levallon
this
new
vitality
issued
radiating
he
found
a
moment
or
two
while
alone
with
devonham
to
exchange
a
few
hurried
sentences
as
they
bent
over
bags
and
bundles
he
asked
quick
questions
these
questions
and
answers
between
the
two
experienced
men
were
brief
but
significant
yes
quiet
as
a
lamb
just
be
kind
and
sympathetic
you
looked
up
the
notes
well
that
ca
be
helped
now
though
i
had
rather
you
knew
nothing
my
mistake
of
course
the
content
of
his
mind
is
accessible
to
me
telepathically
in
any
case
but
at
one
remove
more
distant
because
unexpressed
fillery
laughed
quite
right
i
admit
it
a
pity
but
tell
me
more
about
him
anything
i
ought
to
know
at
once
quiet
as
a
lamb
i
told
you
repeated
the
other
and
most
of
the
way
over
too
but
puzzled
my
god
edward
his
criticisms
would
make
a
book
normal
intelligent
criticisms
intelligent
above
ordinary
normal
no
hysteria
not
a
sign
health
perfect
magnificent
as
you
see
he
less
tired
now
than
when
we
started
three
days
ago
whereas
i
fagged
out
though
in
climbing
condition
origin
of
delusions
any
indication
devonham
looked
up
quickly
his
eyes
flashed
a
peculiarly
searching
glance
something
watchful
in
it
perhaps
no
delusion
at
all
of
any
sort
as
for
origin
of
his
ideas
the
parents
probably
but
stimulated
and
allowed
unchecked
growth
by
mason
affected
by
nature
beyond
anything
know
by
nature
ah
he
checked
himself
and
what
peculiarities
he
asked
his
terror
of
water
for
instance
crossing
the
channel
he
was
like
a
frightened
child
he
hid
from
it
kept
his
hands
over
his
eyes
even
so
as
not
to
see
it
give
any
reason
all
he
said
was
is
unknown
an
enemy
and
can
destroy
me
i
can
not
understand
its
secret
ways
fire
and
wind
are
not
in
it
i
can
not
work
with
it
no
it
was
not
fear
of
drowning
that
he
meant
he
found
comfort
too
in
the
repetition
of
your
name
appetite
pulse
temperature
asked
fillery
after
a
brief
pause
first
two
very
strong
temperature
always
slightly
above
normal
other
peculiarities
he
became
rather
excited
before
a
lighted
match
once
tried
to
kneel
almost
but
i
stopped
it
fire
that
it
instinct
of
worship
presumably
the
barrow
was
laden
the
porter
was
asking
where
the
car
was
they
prepared
to
move
back
to
the
companion
whom
fillery
had
never
failed
to
observe
carefully
over
his
shoulder
during
this
rapid
conversation
had
not
moved
the
whole
time
he
stood
quietly
looking
about
him
a
curious
figure
aloof
somehow
from
his
surroundings
so
tall
and
straight
and
unconcerned
he
seemed
yet
so
poised
alert
virile
vigorous
it
was
not
his
clothes
that
made
him
appear
unusual
nor
was
it
his
eyes
and
hair
alone
though
all
three
contributed
their
share
yet
he
seemed
dressed
up
his
clothes
irksome
to
him
he
was
uncommon
an
attractive
figure
and
many
a
pair
of
eyes
female
eyes
especially
fillery
noticed
turned
to
examine
him
with
undeniable
curiosity
and
women
the
doctor
asked
quickly
in
a
lowered
voice
as
they
followed
the
porter
barrow
towards
levallon
who
already
smiled
at
their
approach
the
most
engaging
trustful
welcoming
smile
that
fillery
had
ever
seen
upon
a
human
countenance
he
lowered
his
head
to
catch
the
reply
but
devonham
only
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
all
attracted
he
mumbled
in
a
half
whisper
and
eager
to
help
him
and
he
gentle
astonished
but
indifferent
oh
supremely
indifferent
levallon
came
forward
to
meet
them
and
fillery
took
his
hand
and
led
him
to
the
car
the
luggage
was
bundled
in
some
behind
and
some
on
the
roof
fillery
and
levallon
sat
side
by
side
the
car
started
we
shall
get
home
in
half
an
hour
the
doctor
mentioned
turning
to
his
companion
we
have
a
good
dinner
and
then
get
to
bed
you
are
hungry
i
know
thank
you
was
the
reply
thank
you
dear
fillery
i
want
sleep
most
will
there
be
trees
and
air
near
me
and
stars
to
see
your
windows
open
on
to
a
garden
with
big
trees
there
will
be
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
you
will
hear
the
sparrows
chattering
at
dawn
but
london
of
course
is
not
the
country
oh
we
make
you
comfortable
never
fear
dear
fillery
i
thank
you
said
levallon
quietly
and
without
more
ado
lay
back
among
the
soft
cushions
and
closed
his
eyes
hardly
a
word
was
said
the
whole
way
out
to
the
suburb
and
when
they
arrived
the
patient
was
too
overcome
with
sleep
to
wish
to
eat
he
went
straight
to
his
room
found
a
hot
bath
into
which
he
tumbled
first
and
then
leaped
into
his
bed
and
was
sound
asleep
almost
before
the
door
was
closed
upon
a
table
beside
the
bed
fillery
with
his
own
hands
arranged
bread
butter
eggs
and
a
jug
of
milk
in
case
of
need
nurse
robbins
an
experienced
tactful
young
woman
he
put
in
special
charge
he
thought
of
everything
divining
his
possible
needs
instinctively
noticing
with
his
keen
practised
eye
several
details
for
himself
at
the
same
time
the
splendid
physical
condition
muscular
development
he
noted
no
freakish
bulky
masses
produced
by
gymnastic
exercises
but
the
muscles
laid
on
flowingly
smooth
and
firm
and
ample
without
a
trace
of
fat
and
the
whole
in
the
most
admirable
proportion
possible
the
leanness
was
deceptive
the
body
was
of
immense
power
the
quick
certain
unerring
movements
he
noticed
too
perfect
swift
between
brain
and
physical
response
no
misdirection
no
miscalculation
the
reactions
extremely
rapid
he
thought
with
a
smile
of
something
between
deer
and
tiger
the
poise
and
balance
and
accuracy
conveyed
intense
joy
of
living
yet
above
and
beyond
these
was
something
else
he
could
not
name
something
that
stirred
in
him
wonder
love
a
touch
of
awe
and
a
haunting
suggestion
of
familiarity
he
saw
him
into
bed
he
saw
him
actually
asleep
the
strong
blue
eyes
looked
up
into
his
own
with
their
intense
and
innocent
gaze
for
a
moment
he
held
the
firm
dry
muscular
hand
ten
seconds
later
the
eyes
were
closed
in
sleep
the
grip
of
the
powerful
but
slender
fingers
relaxed
good
night
my
friend
and
sleep
deeply
we
see
to
everything
you
need
be
happy
here
and
comfortable
with
us
for
you
are
welcome
and
we
love
you
his
voice
trembled
slightly
good
night
dear
the
musical
tones
replied
and
he
was
off
the
windows
were
wide
open
had
thrown
aside
the
pyjamas
and
blankets
on
this
cool
damp
night
of
late
autumn
he
covered
his
big
warm
lithe
body
with
a
single
sheet
only
fillery
went
out
quietly
an
expression
of
keen
approval
and
enjoyment
on
his
face
not
a
smile
exactly
but
that
look
of
deep
content
betraying
a
fine
inner
excitement
of
happiness
which
is
the
mother
of
all
smiles
as
he
softly
opened
the
door
the
draught
blew
through
from
the
open
windows
stirring
the
white
curtains
by
the
bed
it
came
from
the
big
damp
garden
where
the
trees
stood
already
nearly
leafless
and
where
no
flowers
were
and
yet
a
scent
of
flowers
came
faintly
with
it
he
caught
an
echo
of
faint
sound
like
music
there
was
the
invigorating
hint
of
forests
too
it
seemed
a
living
wind
that
blew
into
the
house
fillery
paused
a
moment
sniffed
with
surprise
and
sharp
enjoyment
listened
intently
then
switched
the
light
off
and
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
there
was
a
flash
of
wonder
in
his
eyes
and
a
thrill
of
some
remote
inexplicable
happiness
ran
through
his
nerves
an
instant
of
complete
comprehension
had
been
his
as
if
another
consciousness
had
for
that
swift
instant
identified
itself
with
his
own
chapter
vi
edward
fillery
was
glad
that
paul
devonham
good
friend
and
skillful
colleague
was
his
assistant
for
devonham
competent
as
himself
in
knowledge
and
experience
found
explanations
for
all
things
and
had
in
his
natural
temperament
a
quality
of
sane
judgment
which
corrected
extravagances
devonham
was
agnostic
because
reason
ruled
his
life
devoid
of
imagination
he
had
no
temptations
speculative
within
limits
he
might
be
but
he
belonged
not
to
the
unstable
not
that
he
thought
he
knew
everything
but
that
he
refused
to
base
action
on
what
he
regarded
as
unknown
a
clue
into
the
unknown
he
would
follow
up
as
keenly
carefully
as
fillery
himself
but
he
went
step
by
step
with
caution
declining
to
move
further
until
the
last
step
was
of
hardened
concrete
to
the
powers
of
the
subconscious
self
he
set
drastic
limits
admitting
their
existence
of
course
but
attaching
small
value
to
their
use
or
development
his
own
deeper
being
had
never
stirred
or
wakened
of
this
this
vast
background
in
himself
he
remained
placidly
uninformed
a
comprehensive
view
of
a
problem
the
flash
of
vision
he
never
knew
thus
was
perhaps
denied
him
but
so
far
as
he
went
he
was
very
safe
and
sure
and
his
chief
was
the
first
to
appreciate
his
value
he
appreciated
it
particularly
now
as
the
two
men
sat
smoking
after
their
late
dinner
discussing
details
of
the
new
inmate
of
the
home
fillery
aware
of
the
strong
pull
upon
his
own
mixed
blood
aware
of
a
instinctive
sympathy
towards
almost
of
a
natural
desire
now
having
seen
him
to
believe
him
unique
in
several
ways
and
therefore
conscious
of
a
readiness
to
accept
more
than
any
evidence
yet
justified
feeling
these
symptoms
clearly
and
remembering
vividly
his
experiences
in
the
railway
station
he
was
glad
for
truth
sake
that
devonham
was
there
to
clip
extravagance
before
it
injured
judgment
a
weak
man
aware
of
his
own
frailties
excels
a
stronger
one
who
thinks
he
has
none
at
all
the
two
colleagues
were
a
powerful
combination
in
your
view
it
merely
a
case
of
a
secondary
anyhow
of
a
divided
personality
he
asked
as
soon
as
the
other
had
recovered
a
little
from
his
journey
and
was
digesting
his
meal
comfortably
over
a
pipe
you
have
seen
more
of
him
than
i
have
of
insanity
at
any
rate
there
is
no
sign
at
all
i
take
it
his
relations
with
his
environment
are
sound
none
whatever
devonham
answered
both
questions
at
once
exactly
he
took
off
his
cleaned
them
with
his
handkerchief
and
then
replaced
them
carefully
this
gave
him
time
to
reflect
as
though
he
was
not
quite
sure
where
to
begin
his
story
there
are
certainly
indications
he
went
on
slowly
of
a
divided
personality
though
of
an
unusual
kind
the
margin
between
the
two
between
the
normal
and
the
secondary
self
is
so
very
slight
it
is
not
clearly
defined
i
mean
they
sometimes
merge
and
interpenetrate
the
frontier
is
almost
indistinguishable
fillery
raised
his
eyebrows
you
feel
uncertain
which
is
the
main
self
and
which
the
secondary
personality
he
inquired
with
surprise
devonham
nodded
i
extremely
puzzled
he
admitted
most
marked
self
the
best
defined
the
richest
the
most
fully
developed
seems
to
me
what
should
call
his
secondary
self
this
that
worships
wind
and
fire
is
terrified
by
a
large
body
of
water
is
ignorant
of
human
ways
probably
also
quite
yet
alive
with
a
kind
of
instinctive
wisdom
we
credit
usually
to
the
animal
kingdom
though
far
beyond
anything
animals
can
claim
briefly
what
we
mean
by
the
term
suggested
fillery
not
anxious
for
too
many
details
at
the
moment
exactly
and
i
propose
we
always
refer
to
that
aspect
of
him
as
the
other
the
normal
ordinary
man
being
levallon
his
right
name
he
smiled
faintly
agreed
replied
his
chief
we
shall
always
know
then
exactly
which
one
we
talking
of
at
a
given
moment
now
he
went
on
to
come
to
the
chief
point
and
before
you
give
me
details
of
what
happened
abroad
let
me
hear
your
own
main
conclusion
what
is
levallon
what
is
devonham
hesitated
for
some
time
it
was
evident
his
respect
for
his
chief
made
him
cautious
there
was
an
eternal
battle
between
these
two
keen
though
always
even
humorous
the
victory
not
invariably
perhaps
with
the
assistant
later
evidence
had
often
proved
fillery
swifter
imagination
correct
after
all
or
alternately
shown
him
to
be
wrong
they
kept
an
accurate
score
of
the
points
won
and
lost
by
either
you
can
always
revise
your
conclusions
later
fillery
reminded
him
slyly
call
it
a
preliminary
conclusion
for
the
moment
you
not
had
time
yet
for
a
careful
study
i
know
but
devonham
this
time
did
not
smile
at
the
rally
and
his
chief
noticed
it
with
secret
approval
here
was
something
new
big
serious
it
seemed
devonham
apparently
was
already
too
interested
to
care
who
scored
or
did
not
score
his
notes
of
indeed
betrayed
his
genuine
zeal
sufficiently
levallon
he
said
at
length
to
begin
with
him
i
think
levallon
without
any
flavour
of
is
a
fine
specimen
of
a
normal
human
being
his
physique
is
magnificent
as
you
have
seen
his
health
and
strength
exceptional
the
brain
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
judge
functions
quite
normally
the
intelligence
also
normal
is
much
above
the
average
in
quickness
receptivity
of
ideas
and
judgment
based
on
these
the
emotional
development
however
puzzles
me
the
emotions
are
not
entirely
normal
but
he
paused
again
a
grave
expression
on
his
face
to
answer
your
question
as
well
as
my
limited
observation
of
him
of
levallon
allows
i
repeat
that
i
consider
him
a
normal
young
man
though
with
peculiarities
and
idiosyncrasies
of
his
own
as
with
most
other
normal
young
fellows
who
are
individuals
that
is
he
added
quickly
and
not
turned
out
in
bundles
cut
to
measure
so
much
for
levallon
now
what
about
he
repeated
the
question
fixing
the
assistant
with
his
steady
gaze
he
had
noticed
the
confusion
in
the
reply
my
dear
edward
began
devonham
after
a
considerable
pause
then
he
stuck
fast
sighed
settled
his
glasses
carefully
upon
his
aquiline
sharp
nose
and
relapsed
into
silence
his
forehead
became
wrinkled
his
mouth
much
pursed
out
with
it
paul
this
is
a
court
of
law
i
sha
behead
you
if
you
wrong
yet
fillery
too
spoke
gravely
the
other
kept
his
eyes
down
his
face
still
wore
a
puzzled
look
fillery
detected
a
new
expression
on
the
keen
thoughtful
features
and
he
was
pleased
to
see
it
to
give
you
the
truth
resumed
his
assistant
and
all
question
of
who
is
right
or
who
is
wrong
aside
i
tell
you
frankly
i
am
not
sure
i
confess
myself
up
against
it
it
er
gives
me
the
creeps
a
little
he
laughed
awkwardly
that
swift
watchful
look
as
of
a
man
who
plays
a
part
flashed
and
vanished
your
feeling
anyhow
insisted
his
friend
your
general
feeling
a
general
judgment
based
on
general
feeling
said
the
other
in
a
quiet
tone
has
little
value
it
is
based
necessarily
as
you
know
upon
intuition
which
i
temperamentally
dislike
it
has
no
facts
to
go
upon
i
distrust
generalizations
he
took
a
deep
breath
inhaled
a
lot
of
smoke
exhaled
it
with
relief
and
made
an
effort
it
went
against
the
grain
in
him
to
be
caught
without
an
explanation
in
my
opinion
and
so
far
as
my
limited
observation
of
him
fillery
allowed
himself
a
laugh
of
amused
impatience
leave
out
the
personal
extras
for
once
and
burn
your
bridges
tell
me
finally
what
you
think
about
we
not
scoring
points
now
thus
faced
with
an
alternative
devonham
found
his
sense
of
humour
again
and
forgot
himself
it
cost
him
an
effort
but
he
obeyed
the
bigger
and
less
personal
mind
i
really
do
know
exactly
he
is
he
confessed
again
he
puzzles
me
completely
it
be
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
compelled
by
his
temperament
to
hedge
that
he
represents
as
i
first
thought
the
content
of
his
parents
minds
the
subsequent
addition
of
mason
mind
included
that
possible
usual
and
comprehensible
enough
put
in
the
doctor
watching
him
with
amused
concentration
but
with
an
inner
excitement
scarcely
concealed
or
resumed
devonham
it
be
that
through
these
through
his
mental
inheritance
from
his
parents
and
from
mason
yes
he
taps
the
most
primitive
stores
and
layers
of
racial
memory
we
know
the
if
i
dare
put
it
so
full
proof
being
lacking
is
open
to
him
through
his
subconscious
powers
of
course
that
is
your
usual
theory
is
it
we
have
there
at
any
rate
a
working
hypothesis
with
a
great
mass
of
evidence
generally
speaking
behind
it
do
be
cynical
paul
is
this
merely
a
secondary
personality
or
is
it
the
real
central
self
that
the
whole
point
you
jump
ahead
as
usual
replied
devonham
really
smiling
for
the
first
time
though
his
face
instantly
grew
serious
again
edward
he
went
on
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
say
i
dare
not
dare
not
guess
is
something
entirely
new
to
me
and
i
admit
it
he
seemed
to
find
his
stride
to
forget
himself
i
feel
far
from
cynical
in
my
opinion
is
exceptional
my
notes
suggested
it
long
ago
he
has
for
instance
at
least
so
it
seems
to
me
peculiar
powers
ah
of
suggestion
let
us
put
it
of
suggestion
yes
get
on
with
it
there
a
good
fellow
i
felt
myself
an
extraordinary
vitality
about
him
i
noticed
it
at
once
at
charing
cross
i
saw
you
did
devonham
looked
hard
at
him
you
were
humming
to
yourself
you
know
i
did
know
was
the
surprised
reply
but
i
can
well
believe
it
i
felt
a
curious
pleasure
and
exhilaration
devonham
shrugging
his
shoulders
slightly
resumed
during
the
periods
he
is
ordinary
though
unusually
observant
critical
and
intelligent
during
the
periods
he
becomes
er
if
you
felt
this
felt
anything
in
the
station
it
was
because
something
in
you
called
up
the
aspect
it
quick
of
you
to
guess
that
said
fillery
with
quick
appreciation
you
noticed
a
change
in
me
well
but
the
other
he
divined
my
blood
you
think
it
is
enough
that
you
responded
and
felt
kinship
put
it
that
way
seems
to
me
he
took
a
deeper
breath
and
gave
a
sort
of
gasp
in
some
ways
a
unique
being
as
i
said
before
tell
me
if
you
can
said
fillery
lighting
his
own
pipe
and
settling
back
into
his
chair
tell
me
a
little
about
your
first
meeting
with
him
in
the
jura
mountains
what
happened
and
so
forth
i
remember
of
course
your
notes
after
your
telegram
i
read
carefully
he
glanced
round
at
his
companion
they
were
very
honest
paul
i
thought
eh
he
was
unable
to
refuse
himself
the
pleasure
of
the
little
dig
honest
you
always
are
he
added
we
could
work
together
otherwise
could
we
devonham
deep
in
his
own
thoughts
did
not
accept
the
challenge
he
turned
in
his
chair
puffing
at
his
pipe
i
can
give
you
briefly
what
happened
and
how
things
went
he
said
the
place
then
first
an
ordinary
peasant
châlet
in
a
remote
jura
valley
difficult
of
access
situated
among
what
they
call
the
upper
pastures
i
reached
it
by
and
mule
late
in
the
afternoon
a
peasant
in
a
lower
valley
directed
me
adding
that
monsieur
anglais
was
dead
and
buried
two
days
before
mason
that
is
the
other
nodded
and
adding
that
fou
levallon
of
course
would
eat
me
alive
at
sight
he
spoke
with
respect
however
even
awe
he
hoped
i
had
come
to
take
him
away
the
countryside
was
afraid
of
him
the
valley
struck
me
as
intolerably
lonely
but
of
unusual
beauty
big
forests
great
rocks
and
tumbling
streams
among
cliffs
and
pastures
made
it
exceptional
the
châlet
was
simple
clean
and
comfortable
it
was
really
an
ideal
spot
for
a
thinker
or
a
student
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
a
fire
burning
on
a
pile
of
rock
in
front
of
the
building
the
sun
was
setting
and
its
last
rays
lit
the
entire
little
glen
a
mere
gully
between
precipices
and
forest
slopes
but
especially
lit
up
the
pile
of
rocks
where
the
fire
burned
so
that
i
saw
the
smoke
blue
red
and
yellow
and
the
figure
kneeling
before
it
this
figure
was
a
man
half
naked
and
of
magnificent
proportions
when
i
shouted
you
shout
of
course
yet
he
did
not
say
it
the
figure
rose
and
turned
and
came
to
meet
me
it
was
levallon
devonham
paused
a
moment
fillery
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
i
admit
devonham
went
on
conscious
of
the
other
inquiring
and
intent
expression
i
was
surprised
a
bit
he
smiled
his
faint
unwilling
smile
the
figure
made
me
start
i
was
aware
of
an
emotion
i
am
not
subject
to
what
i
called
just
now
the
creeps
i
thought
at
last
i
had
really
seen
a
a
vision
he
looked
so
huge
so
wonderful
so
radiant
it
was
of
course
the
effect
of
coloured
smoke
and
magnifying
sunset
added
to
his
to
the
waist
he
was
stripped
but
at
first
his
size
his
splendour
a
kind
of
radiance
borrowed
from
the
sunlight
and
the
fire
seemed
to
enlarge
him
beyond
human
he
seemed
to
dominate
even
to
fill
the
little
valley
i
stood
still
uncertain
of
my
feelings
there
was
i
think
a
trace
of
fear
in
me
i
waited
for
him
to
come
up
to
me
he
did
so
he
stretched
out
a
hand
i
took
it
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
fillery
the
inner
excitement
and
delight
increasing
in
him
as
he
listened
stared
in
silence
there
was
no
lightness
in
him
now
you
fillery
that
what
he
said
and
the
first
words
he
uttered
you
fillery
but
spoken
in
a
way
i
find
difficult
to
reproduce
he
made
the
name
sound
like
a
rush
of
wind
of
course
involves
a
draught
of
breath
between
the
teeth
i
know
but
made
the
name
sound
exactly
like
a
gush
of
wind
through
branches
that
the
nearest
i
can
get
to
it
well
and
then
do
be
impatient
edward
i
try
to
be
accurate
but
really
what
happened
next
is
a
bit
beyond
any
experience
that
we
i
have
yet
come
across
and
as
to
what
i
felt
well
i
was
tired
hungry
thirsty
i
wanted
normally
rest
and
food
and
drink
yet
all
these
were
utterly
forgotten
for
a
moment
or
two
i
admit
it
i
felt
as
if
i
had
come
face
to
face
with
something
not
of
this
earth
quite
he
grinned
a
touch
of
gooseflesh
came
to
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
the
fellow
size
and
radiance
in
the
sunlight
the
fact
that
he
stood
there
worshipping
fire
always
to
me
the
most
wonderful
of
natural
phenomena
his
grandeur
and
nakedness
the
way
he
pronounced
your
name
even
all
this
er
upset
my
judgment
for
the
moment
he
paused
again
he
hesitated
a
visual
hallucination
due
to
fatigue
can
be
of
course
very
detailed
sometimes
he
added
a
note
of
challenge
in
his
tone
fillery
watched
his
friend
narrowly
as
he
stumbled
among
the
details
of
what
he
evidently
found
a
difficult
almost
an
impossible
description
natural
enough
he
put
in
you
hardly
be
human
yourself
if
you
felt
nothing
at
such
a
sight
the
loneliness
too
increased
the
effect
went
on
the
other
for
there
was
no
one
nearer
than
the
peasants
who
had
directed
me
a
thousand
feet
below
nor
was
there
another
building
of
any
sort
in
sight
anyhow
it
seemed
i
managed
my
strange
emotions
all
right
for
the
young
man
took
to
me
at
once
he
left
the
fire
if
reluctantly
singing
to
himself
a
sort
of
low
chanting
melody
with
perhaps
five
or
six
notes
at
most
in
it
and
far
from
unmusical
he
explained
the
fire
was
he
actually
worshipping
i
mean
it
was
certainly
worship
judging
by
the
expression
of
his
face
and
his
gestures
of
reverence
and
happiness
but
i
asked
no
questions
i
thought
it
best
just
to
accept
or
appear
to
accept
the
whole
thing
as
natural
he
said
something
about
the
equinox
but
i
did
not
catch
it
properly
and
did
not
ask
this
had
evidently
been
taught
him
it
was
however
the
of
september
oddly
enough
though
the
gales
had
not
yet
come
so
you
got
into
the
châlet
next
asked
the
other
noticing
the
gaps
the
incoherence
he
put
his
coat
on
sat
down
with
me
to
a
meal
of
bread
and
milk
and
cheese
meat
there
seemed
none
in
the
building
anywhere
this
meal
was
if
you
understand
me
obeying
a
mere
habit
automatically
he
did
just
what
it
had
been
his
habit
to
do
with
mason
all
these
years
he
got
the
stuff
himself
quickly
effectively
no
fumbling
anywhere
and
from
that
moment
hardly
spoke
again
until
we
left
two
days
later
i
mean
that
literally
all
he
said
when
i
tried
to
make
him
talk
was
are
not
fillery
or
me
to
fillery
i
need
him
i
almost
felt
that
i
was
living
with
some
marvellously
trained
animal
of
extraordinary
intelligence
gentle
docile
friendly
but
unhappy
because
it
had
lost
its
accustomed
master
but
on
the
other
hand
i
admit
it
i
was
conscious
of
a
certain
power
in
his
personality
beyond
me
to
explain
that
really
is
the
best
description
i
can
give
you
you
mentioned
the
name
of
mason
asked
fillery
avoiding
a
dozen
more
obvious
and
natural
questions
several
times
but
his
only
reply
was
a
smile
while
he
repeated
the
name
himself
adding
your
own
after
it
fillery
mason
fillery
he
would
say
smiling
with
quiet
happiness
like
fillery
the
nights
briefly
i
was
glad
to
see
the
dawn
we
had
separate
rooms
my
own
being
the
one
probably
where
mason
had
died
a
few
days
before
but
it
was
not
that
i
minded
in
the
least
it
was
the
feeling
the
knowledge
in
fact
that
my
companion
was
up
and
about
all
night
in
the
building
or
out
of
doors
i
heard
him
moving
singing
quietly
to
himself
the
wooden
veranda
creaked
beneath
his
tread
he
was
active
all
through
the
darkness
and
can
not
have
slept
at
all
when
i
came
down
soon
after
dawn
he
was
running
over
the
slopes
a
mile
away
running
towards
the
châlet
too
with
the
speed
and
lightness
of
a
deer
he
had
been
to
some
height
i
think
to
see
the
sun
rise
and
probably
to
worship
it
and
your
journey
you
got
him
away
easily
he
was
only
too
ready
to
leave
for
it
meant
coming
to
i
arranged
with
the
peasants
below
to
have
the
châlet
closed
up
took
my
charge
to
neuchâtel
and
thence
to
berne
where
i
bought
him
an
outfit
and
arrived
in
due
course
as
you
know
at
charing
cross
his
first
sight
of
cities
people
trains
steamers
and
the
rest
i
take
it
any
reactions
the
troubles
i
anticipated
did
not
materialize
he
came
like
a
lamb
the
most
helpless
and
pathetic
lamb
i
ever
saw
he
stared
but
asked
no
questions
i
think
he
was
half
dazed
even
stupefied
with
it
all
stupefied
an
odd
word
to
use
i
know
i
should
have
said
perhaps
rather
he
was
so
open
to
my
suggestions
doing
what
my
mind
expected
him
to
do
but
nothing
more
ah
with
one
exception
fillery
meant
to
hear
an
account
of
that
exception
though
the
other
would
willingly
have
foregone
its
telling
evidently
it
was
related
fillery
felt
sure
to
the
unusual
powers
devonham
had
mentioned
oh
you
shall
hear
it
said
the
latter
quickly
for
what
worth
there
no
need
to
exaggerate
of
course
he
told
it
rapidly
accurately
no
doubt
because
his
mind
was
honest
yet
without
comment
or
expression
in
his
voice
and
face
he
supplied
no
atmosphere
i
had
got
him
like
a
lamb
as
i
told
you
to
paris
and
it
was
during
the
customs
examination
the
er
little
thing
occurred
the
man
searching
through
his
trunk
pulled
out
a
packet
of
flat
papers
and
opened
it
he
looked
them
over
with
puzzled
interest
turning
them
upside
down
to
examine
them
from
every
possible
angle
then
he
asked
a
trifle
unpleasantly
what
they
were
i
had
the
smallest
idea
myself
i
had
never
seen
them
before
they
were
very
carefully
wrapped
up
levallon
whose
sudden
excitement
increased
the
official
interest
told
him
that
they
were
maps
it
doubtless
was
the
truth
he
had
made
them
with
mason
but
they
were
papers
to
have
at
such
a
time
hidden
away
too
at
the
bottom
of
the
trunk
and
levallon
manner
and
expression
did
not
help
to
disarm
the
evident
suspicion
he
asked
a
number
of
pointed
questions
in
a
very
disagreeable
way
who
made
them
for
what
purpose
how
they
were
used
and
whether
they
were
connected
with
aviation
i
translated
of
course
i
explained
their
innocence
levallon
excitement
asked
fillery
what
form
did
it
take
rudeness
anger
violence
of
any
sort
he
was
aware
his
friend
would
have
liked
to
shirk
these
details
nothing
of
the
kind
he
hesitated
briefly
then
went
on
he
behaved
rather
as
though
well
as
a
devout
catholic
might
have
behaved
if
his
crucifix
or
some
holy
relic
were
being
mauled
the
maps
were
sacred
symbols
possibly
heaven
knows
what
he
tried
to
take
them
back
the
official
as
a
natural
result
became
still
more
suspicious
and
of
course
offensive
too
my
explanations
and
expostulations
were
quite
useless
for
he
did
even
listen
to
them
devonham
was
now
approaching
the
part
of
the
story
he
least
wished
to
describe
he
played
for
time
he
gave
details
of
the
ensuing
altercation
what
happened
in
the
end
fillery
at
length
interrupted
what
did
levallon
do
there
were
no
arrests
i
take
it
he
added
with
a
smile
paul
coughed
and
fidgeted
he
told
the
literal
truth
however
levallon
after
listening
for
a
long
time
to
the
conversation
he
could
not
understand
suddenly
took
his
fingers
off
the
papers
the
dirty
hand
still
held
them
tightly
on
the
grimy
counter
levallon
began
or
he
suddenly
began
to
breathe
well
heavily
rather
rhythmically
heavily
insisted
the
other
in
a
curious
way
anyhow
he
added
determined
to
keep
strictly
to
the
truth
not
unlike
heathcote
when
he
put
himself
automatically
into
trance
and
then
told
us
what
was
going
on
at
the
other
end
of
england
you
remember
the
case
he
paused
a
moment
again
as
if
to
recall
exactly
what
had
occurred
it
not
easy
to
describe
edward
he
continued
looking
up
you
remember
that
huge
draughty
hall
where
they
examine
luggage
at
the
lyons
station
i
ca
explain
it
but
that
breathing
somehow
caught
the
draughts
used
them
possibly
in
any
case
increased
them
a
wind
came
through
the
great
hall
i
ca
explain
it
he
repeated
i
can
only
tell
you
what
happened
that
wind
most
certainly
came
pouring
steadily
through
for
i
felt
it
myself
and
saw
it
blow
upon
the
fluttering
papers
the
heat
in
the
at
the
same
moment
seemed
to
grow
intense
not
an
oppressive
heat
though
radiant
heat
rather
it
felt
i
mean
like
a
fierce
sunlight
i
looked
up
almost
expecting
to
see
a
great
light
from
which
it
came
it
was
then
at
this
very
moment
the
frenchman
turned
as
if
someone
touched
him
felt
anything
paul
yes
admitted
the
other
slowly
fillery
waited
a
what
i
must
call
a
thrill
his
voice
was
lower
now
of
his
chief
persisted
devonham
waited
a
full
ten
seconds
before
reply
he
again
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
little
apparently
he
sought
his
words
with
honest
care
that
included
also
intense
reluctance
and
disapproval
loveliness
romance
enchantment
but
above
all
i
think
power
he
ground
out
the
confession
slowly
by
power
i
mean
a
sort
of
confidence
and
happiness
increase
of
vitality
call
it
intensification
of
your
consciousness
possibly
a
bigger
perspective
suddenly
a
bigger
scale
of
life
something
er
a
bit
wild
but
certainly
er
uncommonly
stimulating
the
best
word
i
think
is
liberty
perhaps
an
immense
and
careless
sense
of
liberty
and
fillery
knowing
the
value
of
superlatives
in
devonham
cautious
mind
felt
satisfied
he
asked
quietly
what
the
official
did
next
stood
stock
still
at
first
then
his
face
changed
he
smiled
he
looked
up
understandingly
sympathetically
at
levallon
he
spoke
father
too
he
said
with
admiration
a
big
telescope
monsieur
is
an
astronomer
of
the
greatest
i
added
quickly
charts
are
of
infinite
value
to
france
no
sense
of
comedy
touched
me
anywhere
the
ludicrous
was
absent
the
man
bowed
as
carefully
respect
in
every
gesture
he
replaced
the
maps
marked
the
trunk
with
his
piece
of
chalk
and
let
us
go
helping
in
every
way
he
could
devonham
drew
a
long
breath
glad
that
he
had
relieved
himself
of
his
unwelcome
duty
he
had
told
the
literal
truth
of
course
of
course
fillery
said
half
to
himself
perhaps
a
breath
of
bigger
consciousness
his
imagination
touched
the
subconscious
wakened
and
intelligence
the
natural
result
he
turned
to
his
colleague
interesting
paul
very
he
added
in
a
louder
tone
and
not
easy
to
explain
i
grant
the
official
we
do
not
know
but
you
at
any
rate
are
not
a
good
subject
for
hypnotic
suggestion
for
some
time
devonham
said
nothing
presently
he
spoke
fillery
i
tell
you
really
i
love
the
fellow
he
the
most
lovable
thing
in
human
shape
i
ever
saw
he
gets
into
your
heart
so
strangely
we
must
heal
him
the
other
sighed
quickly
smothering
it
yet
not
before
devonham
had
noticed
it
they
did
not
look
at
one
another
for
some
seconds
and
there
was
a
certain
tenseness
a
sense
of
deep
emotion
in
the
air
that
each
possibly
sought
to
hide
from
the
other
devonham
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
that
had
fallen
between
them
to
be
quite
frank
it
levallon
that
appeals
most
to
me
he
said
as
if
to
himself
whereas
you
edward
i
believe
are
more
more
interested
in
the
other
aspect
of
him
it
that
interests
you
no
challenge
was
intended
yet
the
glove
was
flung
fillery
said
nothing
for
a
minute
or
two
then
he
looked
up
and
their
eyes
met
across
the
atmosphere
it
was
close
on
midnight
the
world
lay
very
still
and
hushed
about
the
house
it
is
he
said
quietly
a
pathetic
and
inspiring
case
he
is
deserving
of
he
chose
his
words
slowly
and
with
care
our
very
best
he
concluded
shortly
and
now
he
added
quickly
you
tired
out
and
i
ought
to
have
let
you
have
a
night
sleep
before
taxing
you
like
this
he
poured
out
two
glasses
of
whisky
let
us
drink
anyhow
to
success
and
healing
of
body
mind
and
soul
body
mind
and
nerves
said
devonham
slowly
as
he
drank
the
toast
the
reason
i
had
none
of
the
trouble
i
anticipated
remarked
devonham
as
he
sipped
the
reviving
liquor
is
simple
enough
there
are
two
periods
of
course
i
guessed
that
exactly
there
is
the
levallon
period
when
he
is
quiescent
normal
very
charming
into
the
bargain
more
like
a
good
child
or
trained
animal
or
happy
peasant
if
you
like
it
better
than
a
grown
man
and
there
is
the
period
when
he
is
otherwise
ah
i
arrived
just
at
the
transition
moment
so
to
speak
it
was
during
the
change
i
reached
the
châlet
precisely
fillery
looked
up
smiled
and
nodded
that
about
the
truth
repeated
devonham
putting
his
glass
down
he
thought
for
a
moment
then
added
slowly
i
think
that
fire
of
his
the
worship
singing
at
the
autumnal
equinox
marked
the
change
h
at
once
after
that
slipped
back
into
the
unconscious
state
levallon
emerged
it
was
with
levallon
only
or
chiefly
had
to
deal
he
became
so
very
quiet
dazed
a
little
half
there
as
we
call
it
and
almost
entirely
silent
he
retained
little
if
any
memory
of
the
period
although
it
lies
i
think
just
beneath
the
surface
only
the
levallon
personality
you
see
is
not
very
positive
is
it
it
seems
a
quiet
negative
state
a
condition
almost
of
rest
in
fact
fillery
listening
attentively
made
no
rejoinder
we
may
expect
continued
devonham
these
alternating
states
i
think
the
frontier
between
them
is
as
i
said
a
narrow
one
indeed
often
they
merge
or
interpenetrate
in
my
judgment
the
main
important
part
of
his
consciousness
that
parent
self
is
levallon
the
voice
was
slightly
strident
ah
it
so
happened
that
in
the
act
of
exchanging
these
last
words
they
both
looked
up
toward
the
ceiling
where
a
moth
buzzed
round
and
round
banging
itself
occasionally
against
the
electric
light
whether
it
was
this
that
drew
their
sight
upwards
simultaneously
or
whether
it
was
that
some
other
sound
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
had
caught
their
strained
attention
is
uncertain
the
same
thought
at
any
rate
was
in
both
minds
at
that
instant
the
same
freight
of
meaning
trailing
behind
it
invisibly
across
the
air
their
hearts
burned
within
them
the
two
faces
upward
turned
the
lips
a
little
parted
as
when
listening
is
intense
the
heads
thrown
back
for
in
the
room
above
that
ceiling
asleep
at
this
moment
lay
the
subject
of
their
long
discussion
only
a
few
inches
of
lath
and
plaster
separated
them
from
the
strange
being
who
dropping
out
of
space
as
it
were
had
come
to
make
his
home
with
them
a
being
lonely
utterly
in
the
world
unique
in
kind
perhaps
his
nature
as
yet
undecipherable
lay
trustingly
unconscious
in
that
upper
chamber
the
two
men
felt
the
gravity
the
responsibility
of
their
charge
the
same
thought
had
vividly
touched
them
both
at
the
same
instant
a
few
minutes
later
they
were
still
standing
facing
one
another
they
were
of
a
height
but
compared
to
fillery
big
frame
and
rugged
head
his
friend
appearance
was
almost
slight
devonham
for
all
his
qualifications
looked
painfully
like
a
shopwalker
they
exchanged
this
steady
gaze
for
a
few
seconds
without
speaking
then
the
older
man
said
quietly
paul
i
understand
and
i
respect
your
reticence
i
think
i
can
agree
with
it
he
placed
a
hand
upon
the
other
shoulder
smiling
gently
even
tenderly
you
have
told
me
much
but
you
have
not
told
me
all
the
chief
part
you
have
intentionally
omitted
for
the
present
at
any
rate
was
the
reply
given
without
flinching
your
reasons
are
sound
your
judgment
perhaps
right
i
ask
no
questions
what
happened
what
you
saw
at
the
châlet
the
powers
you
mentioned
all
in
fact
that
you
think
it
wise
to
keep
to
yourself
for
the
moment
i
leave
there
willingly
he
spoke
gravely
sincere
emotion
in
the
eyes
and
tone
it
was
in
a
lower
voice
he
added
the
responsibility
of
course
is
yours
devonham
returned
the
steady
gaze
pondering
his
reply
a
moment
i
can
and
do
accept
it
he
answered
you
have
read
my
thoughts
correctly
as
usual
edward
i
think
you
know
quite
enough
already
what
with
my
notes
and
mason
letter
even
too
much
besides
why
complicate
it
with
an
account
of
what
were
doubtless
mere
mental
pictures
hallucinations
on
my
part
this
is
a
matter
he
went
on
slowly
a
case
we
dare
not
trifle
with
there
may
be
strange
and
terrible
afflictions
in
it
later
we
must
remain
unbiased
the
anxiety
deepened
on
his
face
true
true
murmured
the
other
god
bless
the
boy
may
his
own
gods
bless
him
in
other
words
it
will
need
your
clearest
soundest
judgment
your
finest
skill
your
very
best
as
you
said
yourself
just
now
he
used
a
firmer
yet
also
a
softer
tone
suddenly
edward
you
know
your
own
mind
its
contents
its
suppressions
its
origin
your
refusal
of
the
love
of
women
your
deep
powerful
dreams
that
you
have
suppressed
and
put
away
promise
me
the
voice
and
manner
were
very
earnest
that
you
will
not
communicate
these
to
him
in
any
way
and
that
you
will
keep
your
judgment
absolutely
unbiased
and
untainted
he
looked
at
his
old
friend
and
paused
only
your
purest
judgment
of
what
is
to
come
can
help
you
promise
fillery
sighed
a
scarcely
noticeable
sigh
i
promise
you
paul
you
are
wise
and
you
are
right
he
said
on
the
other
hand
let
me
say
one
thing
to
you
in
my
turn
this
theory
of
heredity
and
of
mental
telepathic
transference
the
idea
that
all
his
mind
content
is
derived
from
his
parents
and
from
mason
we
can
not
remember
force
this
transference
and
interchange
far
i
ask
only
this
be
fair
and
open
yourself
with
all
that
follows
devonham
raised
his
voice
nor
can
we
apparently
set
limits
to
it
edward
but
to
be
fair
and
i
give
my
promise
too
thus
in
the
little
downstairs
room
of
a
private
home
for
incurable
mental
cases
a
lunatic
asylum
though
sometimes
perhaps
next
door
to
it
these
two
men
deeply
intrigued
by
a
new
case
that
passed
their
understanding
as
it
exceeded
their
knowledge
practice
and
experience
swore
to
each
other
to
observe
carefully
to
report
faithfully
and
to
experiment
if
experiment
proved
necessary
with
honest
and
affectionate
uprightness
their
views
were
obviously
not
the
same
devonham
temperamentally
opposed
to
radical
innovations
believed
it
was
a
case
of
divided
personality
hundreds
of
such
cases
had
passed
through
their
hands
forced
to
accept
extended
telepathy
that
all
minds
can
on
occasion
share
one
another
content
and
that
even
a
racial
and
a
can
be
tapped
he
feared
that
his
chief
might
influence
levallon
and
twist
thus
the
phenomena
to
a
special
end
he
knew
edward
story
he
feared
for
the
sake
of
truth
the
mental
transference
he
had
perhaps
other
fears
as
well
fillery
on
the
other
hand
believing
as
much
and
knowing
more
than
his
colleague
saw
in
a
unique
possibility
he
was
thrilled
and
startled
with
a
hope
he
felt
as
if
someone
ran
beside
his
life
bearing
impossible
glad
tidings
an
unexpected
figure
the
tidings
marvellously
bright
he
hoped
he
already
wished
to
think
that
might
shadow
forth
a
promise
of
some
magical
advance
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
the
race
the
thinkers
were
crying
on
the
housetops
that
progress
was
a
myth
that
each
wave
of
civilization
at
its
height
reached
the
same
average
level
without
ever
passing
further
the
menace
to
the
present
civilization
already
crumbling
was
in
full
swing
everywhere
knowledge
culture
learning
threatened
in
due
course
with
the
chaos
of
destruction
that
has
so
far
been
the
invariable
rule
the
one
hope
of
saving
the
world
cried
religion
lay
in
substituting
spiritual
for
material
values
a
utopian
dream
at
best
the
one
chance
said
science
on
the
other
hand
was
that
civilization
is
continuous
and
not
isolated
the
best
hope
believed
fillery
the
only
hope
lay
in
raising
the
individual
by
the
drawing
up
into
full
consciousness
of
the
limitless
powers
now
hidden
and
inactive
in
his
deeper
self
the
subliminal
faculties
with
these
greater
powers
must
come
also
greater
moral
development
already
with
his
uncanny
insight
derived
from
knowledge
of
himself
he
had
piercingly
divined
in
a
being
whatever
he
might
be
whose
nature
acted
automatically
and
directly
upon
the
subconscious
self
in
everybody
that
bright
messenger
running
past
his
life
had
looked
as
with
fire
and
tempest
straight
into
his
eyes
it
was
long
after
one
when
the
two
men
said
and
went
to
their
rooms
devonham
was
soon
in
bed
though
not
soon
asleep
exhausted
physically
though
he
was
his
mind
burned
actively
his
recent
memories
were
vivid
all
he
had
purposely
held
back
from
fillery
returned
with
power
the
uncertainty
whether
he
had
experienced
hallucination
or
had
actually
as
by
telepathic
transfer
from
levallon
touched
another
state
of
consciousness
kept
sleep
far
away
his
brain
was
far
too
charged
for
easy
slumber
he
feared
for
his
dear
faithful
friend
his
colleague
the
skilful
experienced
yet
sorely
tempted
mind
tempted
by
nature
and
by
natural
weaknesses
of
birth
and
origin
who
now
shared
with
him
the
care
and
healing
of
a
case
that
troubled
his
being
too
deeply
for
slumber
to
come
quickly
yet
he
had
done
well
to
keep
these
memories
from
edward
fillery
if
fillery
once
knew
what
knew
his
judgment
and
his
scientific
diagnosis
must
be
drawn
hopelessly
away
from
what
he
considered
the
best
treatment
the
suppression
of
and
the
making
permanent
of
he
fell
asleep
eventually
towards
dawn
dreaming
impossible
radiant
dreams
of
a
world
he
might
have
hoped
for
yet
could
not
within
the
limits
of
his
little
cautious
accurate
mind
believe
in
dreams
that
inspire
yet
sadden
haunted
his
release
from
normal
consciousness
someone
had
walked
upon
his
life
leaving
a
growth
of
everlasting
flowers
in
their
magical
tread
though
his
mind
his
stolid
cautious
mind
had
no
courage
for
the
plucking
and
while
he
slept
as
the
hours
slipped
from
west
to
east
his
chief
and
colleague
lying
also
sleepless
rose
suddenly
before
the
late
autumn
dawn
and
walked
quietly
along
the
corridor
towards
the
private
suite
where
the
new
patient
rested
his
mind
was
quiet
yet
his
inner
mind
alert
his
thoughts
his
hopes
his
dreams
these
lay
perhaps
beyond
human
computation
he
was
calmer
far
than
his
assistant
though
more
strangely
tempted
it
was
just
growing
light
the
corridor
was
cold
a
cool
damp
air
came
through
the
open
windows
and
the
linoleum
felt
like
ice
against
the
feet
the
house
lay
dead
and
silent
pausing
a
moment
by
a
window
he
listened
to
the
chattering
of
early
sparrows
he
felt
chill
and
hungry
unrested
too
though
far
from
sleepy
he
was
aware
of
london
bleak
heavy
stolid
london
town
the
troubles
of
modern
life
of
labour
politics
taxes
cost
of
living
all
the
common
daily
things
came
in
with
the
cheerless
morning
air
he
reached
the
door
he
sought
and
very
softly
opened
it
the
radiance
met
him
in
the
face
so
that
he
almost
gasped
the
scent
of
flowers
the
sting
of
sharp
keen
forest
winds
the
exhilaration
of
some
distant
there
was
actually
a
tang
of
dawn
known
only
to
those
who
have
tasted
the
heights
at
sunrise
with
the
heart
and
into
his
heart
singing
with
happy
confidence
rose
a
sense
of
supreme
joy
and
confidence
that
mastered
all
little
earthly
woes
and
pains
and
walked
among
the
stars
the
occupant
of
the
bed
lay
very
still
his
shining
hair
was
spread
upon
the
pillow
the
splendid
limbs
were
motionless
the
chest
and
arms
were
bare
the
single
covering
sheet
tossed
off
the
strange
wild
face
wore
happiness
and
peace
upon
its
skin
the
features
very
calm
the
mouth
relaxed
it
almost
seemed
a
god
lay
sleeping
there
upon
a
little
human
bed
how
long
he
stood
and
stared
he
did
not
know
but
suddenly
the
light
increased
the
curtains
stirred
about
the
bed
with
a
marvellous
touch
the
separate
details
merged
and
quickened
into
life
the
room
was
changed
the
occupant
of
the
bed
moved
very
swiftly
as
through
the
open
window
came
the
first
touch
of
exhilarating
light
gold
stole
across
the
lintel
breaking
over
the
roofs
of
slates
beyond
the
leafless
elm
trees
shimmered
faintly
the
telegraph
wires
shone
there
was
a
running
sparkle
it
was
dawn
the
figure
leaped
danced
no
other
word
describes
it
to
the
open
window
where
the
light
and
air
gushed
in
spread
wide
its
arms
lowered
its
radiant
head
began
to
sing
in
low
melodious
rhythmic
chant
and
fillery
as
silently
as
he
had
come
withdrew
and
closed
the
door
unseen
his
heart
moved
strangely
but
his
promise
held
him
chapter
vii
the
following
days
it
seemed
to
both
fillery
and
devonham
that
their
discussion
of
the
first
night
had
been
pitched
in
too
intense
too
serious
a
key
their
patient
was
so
commonplace
again
so
ordinary
he
made
himself
quite
at
home
seemed
contented
and
uncurious
taking
it
for
granted
he
had
come
to
stay
for
ever
apparently
apart
from
his
strange
beauty
his
size
virility
and
a
general
impression
he
conveyed
of
immense
energies
he
was
too
to
make
use
of
he
might
have
passed
for
a
peasant
a
countryman
to
whom
city
life
was
new
but
an
educated
or
at
least
countryman
he
was
so
big
yet
never
gauche
he
was
neither
stupid
nor
the
garden
interested
him
he
knew
much
about
the
trees
and
flowers
birds
and
insects
too
he
discussed
the
weather
prevailing
wind
moisture
prospects
of
change
and
so
forth
with
a
judgment
based
on
what
seemed
a
natural
instinctive
knowledge
the
gardener
looked
on
him
with
obvious
respect
such
nice
manners
and
such
a
steady
eye
soames
the
matron
mentioned
too
approvingly
to
devonham
but
a
lot
in
him
he
understand
himself
unless
i
wrong
not
much
the
matter
with
his
nerves
anyhow
once
he
married
unless
i
much
mistaken
eh
sir
he
was
quiet
talking
little
and
spent
the
morning
over
the
books
fillery
had
placed
purposely
in
his
books
on
simple
physics
natural
history
and
astronomy
it
was
the
latter
that
absorbed
him
most
he
pored
over
them
by
the
hour
fillery
explained
the
situation
so
far
as
he
thought
wise
the
young
man
was
honesty
and
simple
innocence
but
only
vaguely
interested
in
the
life
of
the
great
city
he
now
experienced
for
the
first
time
he
had
in
his
luggage
a
copy
of
the
will
by
which
mason
had
left
him
everything
and
he
was
pleased
to
know
himself
well
provided
for
of
mason
however
he
had
only
a
dim
uncertain
almost
an
impersonal
memory
as
of
someone
encountered
in
a
dream
i
suppose
something
happened
to
me
he
said
to
fillery
his
language
normal
and
quite
ordinary
again
he
spoke
with
a
slight
foreign
accent
there
was
somebody
of
course
who
looked
after
me
and
lived
with
me
but
i
ca
remember
who
or
where
it
was
i
was
very
happy
he
added
and
yet
i
miss
something
fillery
remembering
his
promise
did
not
press
him
it
will
all
come
back
by
degrees
he
remarked
in
a
sympathetic
tone
in
the
meantime
you
must
make
yourself
at
home
here
with
us
for
as
long
as
you
like
you
are
quite
free
in
every
way
i
want
you
to
be
happy
here
i
live
with
you
always
was
the
reply
there
are
things
i
want
to
tell
you
ask
you
too
he
paused
looking
thoughtful
there
was
someone
i
told
all
to
once
come
to
me
with
everything
i
help
you
always
so
far
as
i
can
he
placed
a
hand
upon
his
knee
there
are
feelings
big
feelings
i
can
not
reach
quite
but
that
make
me
feel
different
he
smiled
beautifully
from
others
quick
as
lightning
he
had
changed
the
sentence
at
the
last
word
substituting
others
for
you
had
he
been
aware
of
a
slight
uneasy
emotion
in
his
listener
heart
it
had
hardly
betrayed
itself
by
any
visible
sign
yet
he
had
instantly
divined
its
presence
such
evidences
of
a
subtle
intimate
understanding
were
not
lacking
yet
fillery
admirably
restrained
himself
there
are
bright
places
i
have
lost
he
went
on
frankly
no
sign
of
shy
reserve
in
him
i
feel
confused
lost
somewhere
as
if
i
belong
here
i
feel
he
used
an
odd
word
doubled
his
face
shaded
a
little
big
overpowering
london
is
bound
to
affect
you
put
in
fillery
who
had
noticed
the
rapid
discernment
after
living
among
woods
and
mountains
as
you
have
lived
for
years
all
will
come
right
in
a
little
time
we
must
settle
down
a
bit
first
woods
and
mountains
repeated
the
other
in
a
voice
his
eyes
betraying
an
effort
to
follow
thought
elsewhere
of
course
yes
woods
and
mountains
and
hot
living
sunlight
and
the
winds
his
companion
shifted
the
conversation
a
little
he
suggested
a
line
of
reading
and
study
they
talked
also
of
such
ordinary
but
necessary
things
as
providing
a
wardrobe
of
food
exercise
companionship
of
his
own
age
and
so
forth
all
the
commonplace
details
of
ordinary
daily
life
in
fact
the
exchange
betrayed
nothing
of
interest
nothing
unusual
they
mentioned
theatres
music
painting
and
beyond
the
natural
curiosity
of
youth
that
was
ignorant
of
these
no
detail
was
revealed
that
need
have
attracted
the
attention
of
anybody
neither
of
doctor
psychologist
nor
student
of
human
nature
with
the
single
exception
that
the
past
years
had
been
obliterated
from
memory
though
much
that
had
been
acquired
in
them
remained
there
was
not
noticeable
peculiarity
of
any
sort
both
language
and
point
of
view
were
normal
this
was
obviously
levallon
the
personality
scarcely
cast
a
shadow
even
yet
the
doctor
was
quick
to
see
lay
ready
and
waiting
just
below
the
surface
there
was
no
doubt
in
mind
which
was
the
central
self
and
which
its
transient
projection
the
secondary
personality
again
as
he
sat
and
talked
he
had
the
odd
impression
that
someone
with
bright
tidings
ran
swiftly
past
his
life
perhaps
towards
it
the
swift
messenger
was
certainly
not
levallon
levallon
indeed
was
but
a
shadow
cast
before
this
glad
bright
visitant
thus
he
felt
at
any
rate
levallon
was
an
empty
simulacrum
left
behind
while
rested
or
was
active
upon
other
things
things
natural
to
him
elsewhere
levallon
was
an
arm
a
limb
a
feeler
that
thrust
out
at
charing
cross
for
instance
for
a
brief
moment
only
had
peered
across
his
shoulder
then
withdrawn
again
in
the
car
had
sat
by
his
side
levallon
the
being
he
now
chatted
with
was
also
levallon
only
but
in
his
own
heart
deep
down
hidden
yet
eager
to
break
loose
lay
his
own
deeper
self
that
burned
within
him
this
the
important
part
of
him
yearned
towards
and
up
rose
the
strange
symbol
that
always
appeared
when
his
deepest
perhaps
his
subliminal
self
was
stirred
that
lost
radiant
valley
in
the
haunted
caucasus
shone
close
and
brimming
over
with
light
with
flowers
with
splendid
winds
and
fire
symbols
of
a
vaster
grander
happier
life
though
perhaps
a
life
not
yet
within
the
range
of
normal
human
consciousness
the
fiery
symbol
flashed
and
passed
curious
thoughts
and
pictures
rose
flaming
in
his
mind
persistent
ideas
that
bore
no
possible
relation
to
his
intellectual
reasoning
life
passing
across
the
background
of
his
brain
as
with
waves
of
heat
and
colour
they
were
correlated
somewhere
with
harmonious
sound
music
that
is
came
with
them
as
though
inspiration
brought
its
own
sound
with
it
that
made
singing
natural
they
haunted
him
these
vague
pleasurable
phantasmagoria
that
were
connected
he
felt
sure
with
music
as
with
childhood
lost
imaginings
for
a
long
time
he
searched
in
vain
for
their
source
and
origin
then
suddenly
he
remembered
he
heard
his
father
gruff
humorous
voice
there
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
of
course
and
sharply
vividly
the
buried
memory
gave
up
its
dead
his
childish
question
went
crashing
through
the
air
are
we
the
only
beings
in
the
world
nothing
is
ever
lost
he
reminded
himself
with
a
smile
that
devonham
assuredly
never
saw
every
seed
must
bear
its
fruit
in
time
and
emotion
surged
through
him
from
the
remorseless
records
of
his
underself
the
childhood
love
with
its
correlative
of
deep
absolute
belief
returned
upon
him
linked
on
somehow
to
that
old
familiar
symbol
he
knew
to
mean
his
awakening
subconscious
being
a
flowering
caucasian
vale
of
sun
and
wind
a
belief
he
realized
especially
a
belief
of
childhood
remains
for
ever
inexpugnable
eternal
prolific
seed
of
future
harvests
the
unstable
in
him
betrayed
its
ineradicable
dangerous
streak
there
rose
upon
him
in
a
cloud
strange
notions
that
inflamed
imagination
sweetly
later
reading
indeed
had
laid
flesh
upon
the
skeleton
of
the
boyish
notion
though
derived
in
the
first
instance
he
certainly
knew
not
whence
the
literature
and
tradition
of
the
east
he
recalled
peopled
the
elements
with
conscious
life
to
which
the
remnant
of
lost
knowledge
possibly
added
nerves
and
heart
and
blood
in
all
human
bodies
at
any
rate
dwelt
not
necessarily
always
human
spirits
human
souls
he
checked
himself
with
a
smile
he
would
have
liked
to
call
a
chuckle
but
that
yet
held
some
inexplicable
happiness
at
its
heart
his
rugged
eager
face
its
expression
bitten
deeply
by
experience
turned
curiously
young
there
rushed
through
him
the
eastern
conception
of
another
system
of
life
another
evolution
deathless
divine
important
the
order
of
the
a
series
of
nature
beings
entirely
apart
from
human
categories
they
included
many
degrees
from
fairies
to
planetary
spirits
the
gods
so
called
and
their
duties
work
and
purposes
were
concerned
he
remembered
with
carrying
out
the
laws
of
nature
the
busy
tending
of
all
forms
and
structures
from
the
elaborately
marvellous
infusoria
in
a
drop
of
stagnant
water
the
growth
of
crystals
the
upbuilding
of
flowers
and
trees
of
insects
animals
humans
to
the
guidance
and
guardianship
of
those
vaster
forms
of
heavenly
bodies
the
stars
the
planets
and
the
mighty
suns
whose
gigantic
bodies
inhabited
by
immenser
consciousness
people
empty
space
a
noble
useful
selfless
work
god
messengers
he
checked
himself
again
as
the
rich
ancient
notion
flitted
across
his
stirring
memory
delightful
picturesque
conceptions
of
the
planet
young
fair
ignorance
he
reminded
himself
smiling
as
before
whereupon
rose
bursting
through
his
momentary
dream
with
power
the
great
hope
of
his
own
reasoned
scientific
dream
that
man
is
greater
than
he
knows
and
that
the
progress
of
the
race
was
demonstrable
for
to
the
subliminal
powers
of
an
awakened
race
these
nature
beings
with
their
special
faculties
must
lie
open
and
accessible
the
human
and
the
could
unite
nature
must
come
back
into
the
hearts
of
men
and
win
them
again
to
simple
natural
life
with
love
with
joy
with
naked
beauty
death
and
disease
must
vanish
hope
and
purity
return
the
race
must
develop
grow
become
in
the
true
sense
it
could
know
god
the
vision
flashed
upon
him
with
extraordinary
conviction
so
that
he
forgot
for
the
moment
how
securely
he
belonged
to
the
unstable
the
smile
of
happiness
spread
as
it
were
over
his
entire
being
he
glowed
and
pulsed
with
its
delicious
inward
fire
light
filled
his
being
for
an
instant
an
instant
of
intoxicating
belief
and
certainty
and
vision
the
instant
inspiration
of
a
dream
went
lost
and
vanished
he
had
drawn
upon
childhood
and
legendary
reading
for
the
substance
of
a
happiness
he
shook
himself
so
to
speak
he
remembered
his
patients
and
his
duties
his
colleague
too
nothing
meanwhile
occurred
to
arouse
interest
or
attention
levallon
was
quite
docile
ordinary
he
needed
no
watching
he
slept
well
ate
well
spent
his
leisure
with
his
books
and
in
the
garden
he
complained
often
of
the
lack
of
sunlight
and
sometimes
he
might
be
seen
taking
some
deep
breaths
of
air
into
his
lungs
by
the
open
window
or
on
the
balcony
the
phases
of
the
moon
too
interested
him
and
he
asked
once
when
the
full
moon
would
come
and
then
when
devonham
told
him
he
corrected
the
date
the
latter
gave
proving
him
two
hours
wrong
but
on
the
whole
there
seemed
little
to
differentiate
him
from
the
usual
young
man
whose
physique
had
developed
in
advance
of
his
mental
faculties
his
knowledge
in
some
respects
certainly
was
backward
as
in
the
case
of
arrested
development
he
seemed
an
intelligent
countryman
but
an
unusually
intelligent
countryman
though
all
the
time
another
shone
brightly
betraying
itself
in
remarks
and
judgments
oddly
phrased
fillery
took
him
during
the
following
day
or
two
to
concerts
theatres
cinemas
he
enjoyed
them
all
yet
in
the
theatres
he
was
inclined
to
let
his
attention
wander
the
degree
of
alertness
varied
oddly
his
critical
standard
moreover
was
curiously
exacting
he
demanded
the
real
creative
interpretation
of
a
part
and
was
quick
to
detect
a
lack
of
inspiration
of
fine
technique
of
true
conception
in
a
player
reasons
he
failed
to
give
and
argument
seemed
impossible
to
him
but
if
voice
or
gesture
or
imaginative
touch
failed
anywhere
he
lost
interest
in
the
performer
from
that
moment
he
has
poor
breath
he
remarked
he
only
imitates
he
is
outside
or
she
pretends
she
does
not
feel
and
know
feeling
the
feeling
that
comes
of
fire
she
has
not
felt
she
does
not
understand
her
part
you
mean
suggested
fillery
she
does
not
burn
with
it
was
the
reply
at
concerts
he
behaved
individually
too
they
bored
as
well
as
puzzled
him
the
music
hardly
stirred
him
he
showed
signs
of
distress
at
anything
classical
though
wagner
debussy
the
russians
moved
him
and
produced
excitement
he
was
his
remark
with
emphasis
has
he
gives
me
freedom
i
could
fly
and
go
away
he
sets
me
free
and
then
he
would
say
no
more
not
even
in
reply
to
questions
he
could
not
define
the
freedom
he
referred
to
nor
could
he
say
where
he
could
go
away
but
his
face
lit
up
he
smiled
his
delightful
smile
he
looked
happy
stars
he
added
once
in
a
tone
of
interest
in
reply
to
repeated
questions
stars
wind
fire
away
from
he
tapped
his
head
and
breast
i
feel
more
alive
and
real
it
real
and
true
that
music
that
what
you
feel
it
beyond
this
he
replied
again
tapping
his
body
have
the
cinema
interested
him
more
yet
its
limits
seemed
to
perplex
him
more
than
its
wonder
thrilled
him
he
accepted
it
as
a
simple
natural
universal
thing
they
stay
always
on
the
sheet
he
observed
with
evident
surprise
and
i
hear
nothing
they
do
not
even
sing
sound
and
movement
go
together
the
speaking
will
come
explained
fillery
those
are
pictures
merely
i
understand
yet
sound
is
natural
is
it
they
ought
to
be
heard
speech
agreed
his
companion
is
natural
but
singing
is
are
they
not
alive
enough
to
sing
was
the
reply
spoken
to
himself
rather
than
to
his
neighbour
who
was
so
attentive
to
his
least
response
do
they
only
sing
when
fillery
heard
it
and
felt
something
leap
within
him
when
they
are
paid
or
have
an
audience
he
finished
the
sentence
quickly
no
one
sings
naturally
of
their
own
accord
not
in
cities
at
any
rate
was
the
reply
levallon
laughed
as
though
he
understood
at
once
there
is
no
sun
and
wind
he
murmured
of
course
they
can
not
it
was
the
cinemas
that
provided
most
material
for
observation
fillery
found
there
was
in
a
cinema
performance
something
that
excited
his
companion
but
excited
him
more
than
the
doctor
felt
he
was
justified
in
encouraging
obviously
the
other
side
of
him
the
aspect
came
up
to
breathe
under
the
stimulus
of
the
rapid
destroying
pictures
on
the
screen
concerts
did
not
stimulate
him
it
seemed
but
rather
puzzled
him
he
remained
wholly
the
commonplace
levallon
with
one
exception
he
drew
involved
patterns
on
the
edge
of
his
programmes
patterns
of
a
very
complicated
yet
accurate
kind
as
though
he
almost
saw
the
sounds
that
poured
into
his
ears
and
these
ornamented
programmes
fillery
preserved
sound
music
seemed
to
belong
to
his
interpretation
of
movement
about
the
cinema
however
there
seemed
something
almost
familiar
something
he
already
knew
and
understood
the
sound
belonging
to
movement
only
lacking
apart
from
these
small
incidents
levallon
showed
nothing
unusual
nothing
that
a
yokel
untaught
yet
of
natural
intelligence
might
not
have
shown
his
language
perhaps
was
singular
but
having
been
educated
by
one
mind
only
and
in
a
region
of
lonely
forests
and
mountains
remote
from
civilized
life
there
was
nothing
inexplicable
in
the
odd
words
he
chose
nor
in
the
peculiar
if
subtle
and
penetrating
phrases
that
he
used
invariably
he
recognized
the
spontaneous
creative
power
as
distinguished
from
the
derivative
that
merely
imitated
he
found
ways
of
expressing
himself
almost
immediately
both
in
speech
and
writing
however
and
with
a
perfection
far
beyond
the
reach
of
a
country
lad
and
this
swift
aptitude
was
puzzling
until
its
explanation
suddenly
was
laid
bare
he
absorbed
his
companion
realized
at
last
as
by
telepathy
the
content
of
his
own
of
mind
acquiring
the
latter
mood
language
ideas
as
though
the
two
formed
one
being
the
discovery
startled
the
doctor
yet
what
startled
him
still
more
was
the
further
discovery
made
a
little
later
that
he
himself
could
on
occasions
become
so
identified
with
his
patient
that
the
slightest
shade
of
thought
or
feeling
rose
spontaneously
in
his
own
mind
too
he
remained
otherwise
almost
entirely
levallon
and
after
a
full
report
made
to
devonham
and
the
detailed
discussion
thereon
that
followed
fillery
had
no
evidence
to
contradict
the
opinion
levallon
is
the
real
true
self
the
other
personality
as
we
call
it
is
a
mere
digest
and
accumulation
of
material
supplied
by
his
parents
and
by
mason
let
us
wait
and
see
what
happens
when
appears
and
something
fillery
was
content
to
reply
if
answered
devonham
with
sceptical
emphasis
it
ever
does
appear
you
think
it
wo
asked
fillery
with
proper
treatment
said
devonham
decisively
i
see
no
reason
why
should
not
become
happily
merged
in
the
parent
self
in
levallon
and
a
permanent
cure
result
he
put
his
glasses
straight
and
stared
at
his
chief
as
much
as
to
say
you
promised
perhaps
said
fillery
but
in
my
judgment
is
too
slight
to
count
at
all
i
believe
the
whole
real
parent
self
is
and
the
only
life
levallon
has
at
all
is
that
which
peeps
up
through
him
from
fillery
returned
his
serious
look
if
is
the
real
self
and
i
am
right
he
added
slowly
you
paul
will
have
to
revise
your
whole
position
i
shall
returned
devonham
but
you
will
allow
this
it
is
a
lot
to
expect
i
see
no
reason
to
believe
in
anything
more
than
a
subconscious
mind
of
unusual
content
and
possibly
of
unusual
powers
and
extent
he
added
with
reluctance
it
is
said
fillery
significantly
a
lot
to
expect
as
you
said
just
now
i
grant
you
that
yet
i
feel
it
possible
that
he
hesitated
devonham
looked
uncomfortable
he
fidgeted
he
did
not
like
the
pause
a
sense
of
exasperation
rose
in
him
as
though
he
knew
something
of
what
was
coming
paul
went
on
his
chief
abruptly
in
a
tone
that
dropped
instinctively
to
a
lower
key
almost
a
touch
of
awe
lay
behind
it
you
admit
no
deity
i
know
but
you
admit
purpose
design
intelligence
well
replied
the
other
patiently
long
experience
having
taught
him
iron
restraint
it
a
blundering
imperfect
system
inadequately
organized
if
you
care
to
call
that
intelligence
it
of
an
extremely
intricate
complexity
i
admit
that
deity
i
consider
an
unnecessary
assumption
the
love
and
hate
of
atoms
alone
bowls
you
over
was
the
unexpected
comment
the
word
explains
nothing
a
machine
obeys
the
laws
but
intelligence
conceived
that
machine
and
a
man
repairs
and
keeps
it
going
who
what
keeps
the
daisy
going
the
crystal
the
creative
thought
in
the
imagination
an
egg
becomes
a
caterpillar
which
in
turn
becomes
a
butterfly
with
wings
a
yolk
turns
into
feathers
is
that
accomplished
without
intelligence
ask
our
new
patient
interrupted
devonham
wiping
his
glasses
with
unnecessary
thoroughness
which
devonham
startled
looked
up
without
his
glasses
it
seemed
the
question
made
him
uneasy
putting
the
glasses
on
suddenly
he
stared
at
his
chief
i
see
what
you
mean
edward
he
said
earnestly
his
interest
deeply
captured
be
careful
we
know
nothing
remember
nothing
of
life
do
jump
ahead
like
this
or
take
your
dreams
for
reality
we
have
our
duty
in
a
case
like
this
fillery
smiled
as
though
to
convey
that
he
remembered
his
promise
humanity
he
replied
is
a
very
small
section
of
the
universe
compared
to
the
minuter
forms
of
life
which
be
quite
as
important
if
not
more
so
the
human
section
is
even
negligible
while
compared
to
the
possibility
of
greater
forms
he
broke
off
abruptly
as
you
say
paul
we
know
nothing
of
life
after
all
do
we
nothing
less
than
nothing
we
observe
and
classify
a
few
results
that
all
we
must
beware
of
narrow
prejudice
at
any
rate
you
and
i
his
eyes
lost
their
light
his
speech
dried
up
his
ideas
dreams
speculations
returned
to
him
unrewarded
unexpressed
with
natures
in
whom
the
subconscious
never
stirred
natures
through
whom
its
magical
fires
cast
no
faintest
upward
gleam
intercourse
was
ever
sterile
unproductive
such
natures
had
no
background
even
a
fact
with
them
was
detached
from
its
true
big
life
its
full
significance
its
divine
potentialities
we
must
beware
of
prejudice
he
repeated
quietly
we
seek
truth
only
we
must
beware
replied
devonham
as
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
of
suggestion
of
above
all
we
must
remember
how
repressed
desires
dramatize
themselves
especially
he
added
significantly
when
aided
by
imagination
we
seek
only
facts
on
his
face
appeared
swiftly
before
it
vanished
again
an
expression
of
keen
anxiety
almost
of
affliction
yet
tempered
as
it
were
by
surprise
and
wonder
by
pity
possibly
and
certainly
by
affection
chapter
viii
to
devonham
meanwhile
levallon
behaviour
was
polite
and
kind
and
distant
he
did
not
show
distrust
of
any
sort
but
he
betrayed
a
certain
diffidence
reserve
and
caution
trust
he
felt
sympathy
he
did
not
feel
to
the
amusement
of
fillery
he
suggested
almost
a
kind
of
mild
contempt
when
dealing
with
him
and
this
amusement
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
it
obviously
annoyed
devonham
while
it
gratified
his
chief
for
towards
fillery
levallon
behaved
with
an
intimate
and
understanding
sympathy
that
proved
his
instantaneous
affection
based
upon
mutual
comprehension
it
seemed
that
levallon
and
fillery
had
known
one
another
always
it
was
doubtless
due
to
this
innate
sympathy
between
them
that
edward
fillery
rare
gift
of
absorbing
the
content
of
another
mind
even
to
the
point
of
taking
on
that
other
conditions
physical
and
emotional
at
the
same
time
was
so
successful
by
means
of
a
highly
developed
power
of
he
had
learned
so
to
identify
his
own
mind
thought
feeling
with
those
of
a
patient
that
there
resulted
a
kind
of
merging
by
which
he
literally
became
that
patient
he
felt
with
him
as
a
subject
sees
the
pictures
in
the
hypnotiser
mind
perceives
his
thoughts
divines
his
slightest
will
so
fillery
reversing
the
process
could
realize
for
the
moment
exactly
what
his
patient
was
thinking
feeling
desiring
it
was
of
great
use
to
him
in
his
strange
practice
this
gift
naturally
varied
in
degree
and
was
not
invariably
successful
in
some
cases
he
only
felt
the
emotion
alone
being
thus
transferred
in
others
he
only
saw
what
the
patient
saw
or
thought
he
saw
the
accompanying
emotion
being
omitted
in
others
again
as
in
cases
of
vision
at
a
distance
either
of
time
or
space
he
had
been
able
to
follow
the
travelling
sight
of
his
patient
whose
consciousness
in
trance
was
operating
far
away
and
thus
to
check
for
subsequent
verification
exactly
what
that
patient
saw
he
had
shared
strange
experiences
with
others
with
a
man
for
instance
in
whom
sight
was
transferred
to
the
tip
of
his
index
finger
so
that
he
could
read
a
book
by
passing
that
finger
along
the
printed
line
with
a
woman
again
in
whom
exteriorized
consciousness
manifested
itself
so
that
if
the
air
several
inches
from
her
face
was
pinched
or
struck
the
impact
was
received
and
an
actual
bruise
produced
upon
her
skin
this
extension
of
consciousness
its
seeds
already
in
his
nature
he
had
trained
and
developed
to
a
point
where
he
could
almost
rely
upon
bringing
about
quickly
the
desired
conditions
its
success
however
as
mentioned
was
variable
with
especially
now
this
variableness
was
marked
sometimes
it
was
so
easily
accomplished
as
to
seem
natural
and
without
a
conscious
effort
while
at
other
times
it
failed
completely
since
it
was
in
no
sense
an
attempt
to
transfer
anything
from
his
own
mind
to
that
of
the
patient
fillery
felt
that
his
promise
to
his
colleague
was
not
involved
the
following
scene
describes
the
first
time
in
which
the
process
took
place
with
his
new
patient
fillery
himself
wrote
down
the
words
supplied
the
detailed
description
filled
in
the
emotion
and
psychology
but
exactly
as
these
occurred
and
as
he
felt
them
both
when
these
took
place
respectively
in
his
own
consciousness
and
in
that
of
his
patient
part
of
the
time
he
was
present
part
of
it
he
was
not
visibly
so
being
screened
from
observation
yet
so
placed
that
he
could
note
everything
that
happened
it
is
clear
however
that
his
mind
was
so
intimately
with
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
that
he
experienced
in
his
own
being
all
that
experienced
the
description
was
written
immediately
after
the
occurrence
though
some
of
it
the
spoken
language
in
particular
was
jotted
down
in
his
hiding
place
at
the
actual
moment
the
interlacing
of
the
two
minds
their
interpenetration
as
it
were
one
occasionally
dominating
the
other
is
curious
to
trace
and
far
from
difficult
to
disentangle
similarly
the
interweaving
of
levallon
and
is
noticeable
the
description
given
by
devonham
of
the
portion
of
the
occurrence
he
witnessed
personally
or
heard
about
from
nurse
robbins
and
the
attendants
this
description
reduces
the
whole
thing
to
the
commonplace
level
of
a
slight
seizure
accompanied
by
signs
of
violence
and
moments
of
delirium
due
to
excitement
and
fatigue
and
soon
cured
by
sleep
the
occurrence
took
place
precisely
at
the
period
when
the
moon
was
at
the

ix

my

opened
my
eyes
in
a
soft
but
not
refreshing
case
standing
on
four
iron
legs
and
well
off
the
ground
and
covered
with
coarse
white
coverings
piled
thickly
on
my

it
was
a

sunshine
for
which
i
hungered
thick
solid
walls
shut
off

no

showed
overhead
because
an
enormous
lid
hid
every

no

therefore
lay
upon

sheets
i
smelt
no
earth
no

no
flowers
no

natural
sound
entered
except
the
chattering
of
dirty
sparrows

lost
its
freshness
i
was
in
a
hospital
one
comely
figure
alone
gave
me
a
little
joy
it
was
soft
and
slim
and
graceful
with
a
smell
of
fern
and
morning
in
its
hair
though
that
hair
was
lustreless
and
balled
up
in
ugly
lumps
with
strips
of
thin
metal
in
it
they
called
it
nurse
and
sister
it
was
the
first
moving
thing
i
saw
when
my
eyes
opened
on
my
limited
and
enclosed
surroundings
my
heart
beat
quicker
a
flash
of
thin
joy
came
up
in
me
i
had
seen
something
similar
before
somewhere
it
reminded
me
i
mean
of
something
i
had
known
elsewhere
though
but
a
shabby
lifeless
clumsy
copy
of
this
other
glorious
thing
though
not
real
it
stirred
this
faint
memory
of
reality
so
that
i
caught
at
the
skirts
of
moonlight
stars
and
flowers
reflected
in
a
forest
pool
where
my
companion
played
for
long
periods
of
happiness
between
our
work
the
perfume
and
the
eyes
did
that
i
watched
it
for
a
bit
as
it
moved
away
came
close
and
looked
at
me
when
the
eyes
met
mine
a
wave
of
life
but
of
little
life
surged
faintly
through
me
they
were
dim
and
pitiful
these
eyes
mournful
unlit
unseeing
the
stars
had
set
in
them
dull
shadows
crowded
they
were
so
small
they
were
hungry
too
they
were
unsatisfied
for
some
minutes
it
puzzled
me
then
i
understood
that
was
the
word
unsatisfied
ah
but
i
could
alter
that
i
could
comfort
help
at
any
rate
my
strength
though
horribly
clipped
and
blocked
could
manage
a
little
thing
like
that
my
smaller
rhythms
i
could
put
into
it
the
eyes
the
smile
the
whole
soft
comely
bundle
so
pitifully
hungry
and
unsatisfied
i
rose
and
seized
pressing
it
close
inside
my
own
great
arms
and
burying
it
all
against
my
breast
i
crushed
it
but
very
gently
as
i
might
crush
a
sapling
my
lips
were
amid
the
ferny
hair
i
breathed
upon
it
willingly
glad
to
help
it
was
a
poor
unfinished
thing
i
felt
at
once
soft
and
yielding
where
it
should
have
been
resilient
and
elastic
as
fresh
turf
the
perfume
had
no
body
it
faded
instantly
there
was
so
little
life
in
it
but
as
i
held
it
in
my
big
embrace
smothering
its
hunger
as
best
i
could
within
my
wave
of
being
this
bundle
this
poor
pitiful
bundle
screamed
and
struggled
to
get
free
it
bit
and
scratched
and
uttered
sounds
like
those
squeaks
the
less
swift
creatures
make
when
the
swifter
overtake
them
i
was
too
surprised
to
keep
it
to
me
i
relaxed
my
hold
the
instant
i
did
so
the
figure
thus
released
stood
upright
like
a
young
birch
the
wind
sets
free
the
figure
looked
alive
the
hair
fell
loose
untidily
the
puny
face
wore
colour
the
eyes
had
fire
in
them
i
saw
that
fire
it
was
a
message
memory
stirred
faintly
in
me
ah
i
cried
i
helped
you
anyhow
a
little
the
scene
that
followed
filled
me
with
such
trouble
and
bewilderment
that
i
can
not
recall
exactly
what
occurred
the
figure
seemed
to
spit
at
me
yet
not
with
grace
and
invitation
there
was
no
sign
of
gratitude
i
was
entirely
misunderstood
it
seemed
bells
rang
as
the
figure
rushed
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
it
called
aloud
similar
though
quite
lifeless
figures
came
in
answer
and
filled
the
room
a
doctor
devonham
they
called
him
followed
them
i
was
most
carefully
examined
in
a
dozen
curious
ways
that
tickled
my
skin
a
little
so
that
i
smiled
but
i
lay
quite
still
and
silent
watching
the
whole
performance
with
a
confusion
in
my
being
that
baffled
my
comprehending
what
was
going
on
most
of
the
figures
were
frightened
then
the
doctor
gave
place
to
fillery
whose
name
has
rhythm
to
him
i
spoke
at
once
i
wished
to
comfort
and
revive
her
i
told
him
she
is
so
starved
i
was
most
gentle
she
brings
a
message
only
he
made
no
reply
but
gazed
at
me
with
the
corners
of
his
mouth
both
twitching
and
in
his
eyes
ah
his
eyes
had
more
of
the
sun
in
them
a
flash
of
something
that
had
known
fire
at
least
if
it
had
not
kept
it
my
god
i
worship
thee
i
murmured
at
the
glimpse
of
the
power
i
must
own
as
master
and
creator
of
my
being
even
when
thou
art
playful
i
adore
thee
and
obey
then
four
other
figures
shaped
like
the
doctor
but
wholly
mechanical
a
mere
blind
weight
operating
through
them
held
my
arms
and
legs
not
the
least
desire
to
move
was
in
me
luckily
i
say
luckily
because
had
i
wished
it
i
could
have
flung
them
through
the
roof
blown
down
the
little
walls
caught
up
a
dozen
figures
in
my
arms
and
rushed
forth
with
them
towards
the
powers
of
fire
and
wind
to
which
i
belonged
could
i
i
felt
that
i
could
the
sight
of
the
true
fire
small
though
it
was
in
the
comely
figure
and
the
doctor
eyes
had
set
me
in
touch
again
with
my
home
and
origin
this
touch
i
had
somehow
lost
i
had
been
ill
with
what
they
called
nervous
disorder
and
injured
reason
the
lost
touch
was
now
restored
but
luckily
as
i
said
there
was
no
desire
in
me
to
set
free
these
other
figures
to
help
them
in
any
way
after
the
reception
my
first
kindly
effort
had
experienced
i
lay
quite
still
held
by
these
four
grotesque
and
puny
mechanisms
the
comely
one
with
the
others
similar
to
her
had
withdrawn
i
felt
very
kindly
towards
them
all
but
especially
towards
the
doctor
fillery
who
had
shown
that
he
knew
my
deity
and
origin
none
of
them
were
worth
much
trouble
anyhow
i
felt
that
too
a
mild
contempt
was
in
me
dangerous
was
a
word
i
caught
them
whispering
as
they
went
i
laughed
a
little
the
four
faces
over
me
made
odd
grimaces
tightening
their
lips
and
gripping
my
legs
and
arms
with
greater
effort
the
doctor
fillery
noticed
it
easy
remember
he
addressed
the
four
there
really
no
need
to
hold
it
wo
recur
i
nodded
we
understood
one
another
and
with
a
smile
at
me
he
left
the
room
saying
he
would
come
back
after
a
short
interval
a
link
with
my
source
a
brother
as
it
were
went
with
him
i
was
lonely
i
began
to
hum
songs
to
myself
little
fragments
of
a
great
natural
music
i
had
once
known
but
lost
and
i
noticed
that
the
four
figures
as
i
sang
relaxed
their
grip
of
my
limbs
considerably
to
tell
the
truth
i
forgot
that
they
were
holding
me
their
grip
anyhow
was
but
a
thread
i
could
snap
without
the
smallest
effort
the
songs
were
happiness
in
me
upon
free
leaping
rhythms
i
careered
with
an
exhilarating
rush
of
liberty
all
about
space
i
soared
and
sank
i
was
picked
up
flung
far
riding
the
crest
of
immense
waves
of
orderly
vibration
that
delighted
me
i
let
myself
go
a
bit
let
my
voice
out
i
mean
no
effort
accompanied
my
singing
it
was
automatic
like
breathing
almost
it
was
natural
to
me
these
rhythmical
sounds
and
the
patterns
that
they
wove
in
space
were
the
outlines
of
forms
it
was
my
work
to
build
this
expressed
my
nature
only
my
power
was
blocked
and
stifled
in
this
confining
body
the
fire
and
air
which
were
my
tools
i
could
not
control
i
have
forgotten
forgotten
got
a
voice
ai
he
observed
one
of
the
figures
admiringly
lunies
can
do
anything
they
have
a
mind
to
grand
opera
is
it
yes
mentioned
the
fourth
but
he
lift
the
roof
off
presently
we
better
stop
him
before
there
any
trouble
i
stopped
of
myself
however
their
remarks
interested
me
also
while
i
had
been
singing
although
i
called
it
humming
only
they
had
gradually
let
go
of
me
and
were
now
sitting
down
on
my
bed
and
staring
with
quite
pleasant
faces
all
their
dim
eight
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
their
forms
were
not
built
well
where
did
you
get
that
from
asked
the
one
who
had
spoken
first
can
you
give
me
the
name
of
it
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
was
like
the
scratching
of
a
pin
after
the
enormous
rhythm
that
now
ceased
ai
printed
is
it
he
went
on
as
i
stared
not
understanding
what
he
meant
i
got
a
sister
at
the
halls
he
explained
she
make
a
hit
with
that
kind
of
thing
gave
me
quite
a
twist
inside
to
hear
it
he
added
turning
to
the
others
the
others
agreed
solemnly
with
dull
stupid
faces
i
lay
and
listened
to
their
talk
i
longed
to
help
them
i
had
forgotten
how
a
bit
churchy
i
thought
it
said
one
but
i
confess
it
stirred
me
up
churchy
or
not
it
the
stuff
insisted
the
first
oh
it
the
stuff
to
give
right
enough
and
they
looked
at
me
admiringly
again
where
did
you
get
it
if
i
may
ask
replied
number
one
in
a
more
respectful
tone
his
face
looked
quite
polite
the
lips
stretched
showing
yellow
teeth
it
was
his
smile
but
his
eyes
were
a
little
more
real
oh
where
was
my
fire
i
could
have
built
the
outline
better
so
that
he
was
real
and
might
express
far
more
i
have
forgotten
i
hear
it
i
told
him
because
i
in
it
it
all
about
me
it
never
stops
it
what
we
build
with
number
one
seemed
greatly
interested
hear
it
do
you
why
that
odd
now
you
see
he
looked
at
his
companions
apologetically
as
though
he
knew
they
would
not
believe
him
my
father
was
like
that
he
heard
his
music
he
always
used
to
say
but
we
laughed
at
him
he
was
a
composer
by
trade
oh
his
stuff
was
printed
too
of
course
he
added
there
musical
talent
in
the
family
as
though
that
explained
everything
he
turned
to
me
again
give
us
a
little
more
mister
if
you
do
object
that
is
he
added
and
his
face
was
soft
as
he
said
it
only
gentle
like
if
you
do
mind
yes
keep
it
down
a
bit
another
put
in
looking
anxiously
in
the
direction
of
the
closed
door
he
patted
the
air
with
his
open
palm
slowly
carefully
as
though
he
patted
an
animal
that
might
rise
and
fly
at
him
i
hummed
again
for
them
but
this
time
with
my
lips
closed
the
waves
of
rhythm
caught
me
up
and
away
i
soared
and
flew
and
dropped
and
rose
again
upon
their
huge
coloured
crests
curtains
and
sheets
of
quiet
flame
in
palest
gold
flared
shimmering
through
the
sound
while
winds
that
were
full
of
hurricanes
and
cyclones
swept
down
to
lift
the
fire
and
dance
with
it
in
spirals
the
perfume
of
great
flowers
rose
there
were
flowers
everywhere
and
stars
shone
through
it
all
like
showers
of
gold
ah
i
began
to
remember
something
it
was
flowers
and
stars
as
well
as
human
forms
we
worked
to
build
but
i
kept
the
fire
from
leaping
into
actual
flame
the
mighty
winds
i
held
back
even
thus
pent
and
checked
their
powerful
volume
made
the
atmosphere
shake
and
pulse
about
us
only
i
could
not
control
them
now
with
an
effort
i
came
back
came
down
as
it
were
and
saw
the
funny
little
faces
staring
at
me
with
opened
eyes
and
mouths
and
yellow
teeth
pale
gums
their
skins
gone
whitish
their
figures
rigid
with
their
tense
emotion
they
were
so
poorly
made
the
patterns
so
imperfect
the
new
respect
in
their
manner
was
marked
plainly
suddenly
all
four
turned
together
towards
the
door
i
stopped
the
doctor
had
returned
but
it
was
fillery
again
i
liked
the
feel
of
him
he
wanted
to
sing
sir
so
we
let
him
it
seemed
to
relieve
him
a
bit
they
explained
quickly
and
with
an
air
of
helpless
apology
good
good
said
the
doctor
quite
good
any
normal
expression
that
brings
relief
is
good
he
dismissed
them
they
went
out
casting
back
at
me
expressions
of
puzzled
thanks
and
interest
the
door
closed
behind
them
the
doctor
seated
himself
beside
me
and
took
my
hand
i
liked
his
touch
his
hand
was
alive
at
any
rate
although
within
my
own
it
felt
rather
like
a
dying
branch
or
bunch
of
leaves
i
grasped
the
life
if
thin
was
real
where
the
rest
of
it
i
asked
him
meaning
the
music
i
used
to
have
it
all
it
left
me
gone
away
what
cut
it
off
you
not
cut
off
really
he
said
gently
you
can
always
get
into
it
again
when
you
really
need
it
he
gazed
at
me
steadily
for
a
minute
then
said
in
his
quiet
voice
a
full
nice
tone
with
wind
through
a
forest
running
in
it
mason
mason
he
said
no
more
but
watched
me
the
name
stirred
something
in
me
i
could
not
get
at
quite
i
could
not
reach
down
to
it
i
was
troubled
by
a
memory
i
could
not
seize
mason
i
repeated
returning
his
strong
gaze
what
who
was
mason
and
where
i
connected
the
name
with
a
sense
of
liberty
also
with
great
winds
and
pools
of
fire
with
great
figures
of
golden
skin
and
radiant
faces
with
music
too
the
music
that
had
left
me
you
forgotten
for
the
moment
came
the
deep
running
voice
i
liked
he
looked
after
you
for
twenty
years
he
gave
his
life
for
you
he
loved
you
he
loved
your
mother
your
father
was
his
friend
has
he
gone
gone
back
he
dead
i
can
get
after
him
though
i
said
for
the
name
touched
me
with
a
sense
of
lost
companionship
i
wanted
though
the
reference
to
my
father
and
mother
left
me
cold
i
can
easily
catch
him
up
when
i
move
with
my
wind
and
fire
the
fastest
things
stand
still
my
own
speed
once
i
was
free
again
i
knew
outpaced
easily
the
swiftest
bird
outpaced
light
itself
yes
agreed
the
doctor
only
he
does
want
that
now
you
can
always
catch
him
up
when
the
time
comes
besides
he
waiting
for
you
anyhow
i
knew
that
was
true
i
sank
back
comforted
upon
the
stuffy
pillows
and
lay
silent
this
tinkling
chatter
wearied
me
it
was
like
trickling
wind
i
wanted
the
flood
of
hurricanes
the
pulse
of
storms
my
building
shaping
powers
my
great
companions
oh
where
were
they
he
taught
you
himself
taught
you
all
you
know
i
heard
the
tinkling
go
on
again
but
he
kept
you
away
from
life
thinking
it
was
best
he
was
afraid
for
you
afraid
for
others
too
he
kept
you
in
the
woods
and
mountains
where
as
he
believed
you
could
alone
express
yourself
and
so
be
happy
a
hundred
times
in
babyhood
and
early
childhood
you
nearly
died
he
nursed
you
back
to
life
his
own
life
he
renounced
now
he
is
dead
he
has
left
you
all
his
money
he
paused
i
said
no
word
faint
memories
passed
through
my
mind
but
nothing
i
could
hold
and
seize
the
money
i
did
not
understand
at
all
except
that
it
was
necessary
he
thought
at
first
that
you
could
not
possibly
live
to
manhood
to
his
surprise
you
survived
everything
illness
accident
disaster
of
every
sort
and
kind
then
as
you
grew
up
he
realized
his
mistake
instead
of
keeping
you
away
from
life
he
ought
to
have
introduced
you
to
it
and
explained
it
as
i
and
devonham
are
now
trying
to
do
you
could
not
live
for
ever
alone
in
woods
and
mountains
when
he
was
gone
there
would
be
no
one
to
look
after
you
and
guide
you
the
trickling
of
wind
went
on
and
on
i
hardly
listened
to
it
he
did
it
for
his
own
pleasure
i
suppose
it
pleased
and
soothed
him
possibly
yet
i
remembered
every
syllable
it
was
a
small
detail
to
keep
fresh
when
my
real
memory
covered
the
whole
planet
before
he
died
he
recognized
his
mistake
and
faced
the
position
boldly
it
was
some
years
before
the
end
he
was
hale
and
hearty
still
yet
the
end
he
knew
was
in
sight
while
the
power
was
still
strong
in
him
therefore
he
did
the
only
thing
left
to
him
to
do
he
used
his
great
powers
he
used
suggestion
he
hypnotized
you
telling
you
to
forget
from
the
moment
of
his
death
but
not
before
forget
everything
it
was
only
partially
successful
the
door
opened
the
comely
figure
glanced
in
then
vanished
she
wants
more
help
from
me
i
interrupted
the
monotonous
tinkling
instantly
for
pity
stirred
in
me
again
as
i
saw
her
eager
hungry
and
unsatisfied
little
eyes
call
her
back
i
feel
quite
willing
it
is
one
of
the
lower
forms
we
made
i
can
improve
it
fillery
as
he
was
called
looked
at
me
steadily
his
mouth
twitching
at
the
corners
as
before
a
flash
of
fire
flitting
through
his
eyes
the
fire
made
me
like
and
trust
him
the
twitching
too
i
liked
for
it
meant
he
knew
how
absurd
he
was
yet
he
was
bigger
than
the
other
figures
you
ca
do
that
he
said
you
must
and
then
laughed
outright
it
is
done
you
know
here
why
not
sir
i
asked
using
the
terms
the
figures
used
i
feel
like
that
of
course
you
do
but
all
you
feel
ca
be
expressed
except
at
the
proper
times
and
places
the
consent
of
the
other
party
always
is
involved
he
went
on
slowly
when
it
a
question
of
expressing
anything
you
feel
this
puzzled
me
because
in
this
particular
instance
the
other
party
had
asked
me
with
her
eyes
to
comfort
her
i
told
him
this
he
laughed
still
more
caught
by
the
sound
it
was
just
like
wind
passing
among
tall
grasses
on
a
mountain
ridge
i
forgot
what
he
was
talking
about
for
the
moment
the
sound
carried
me
away
towards
my
own
rhythms
you
got
such
amazing
insight
he
went
on
tinkling
to
himself
for
i
heard
although
i
did
not
listen
you
read
the
heart
too
easily
too
quickly
you
must
learn
to
hide
your
knowledge
the
laughter
which
ran
with
the
words
then
ended
and
i
came
back
to
the
last
thing
i
had
definitely
listened
to
express
expressing
was
the
phrase
he
used
you
told
me
that
is
the
purpose
for
which
here
i
believe
it
is
he
agreed
more
solemnly
only
sometimes
then
exactly
if
that
expression
involves
another
in
pain
or
trouble
or
discomfort
ah
i
have
to
choose
you
mean
i
have
to
know
first
what
the
other
feels
about
it
i
began
to
understand
better
it
was
a
game
and
all
games
delighted
me
you
may
put
it
roughly
so
yes
he
explained
you
very
quick
i
give
you
a
rule
to
guide
you
he
went
on
i
listened
with
an
effort
this
tinkling
soon
wearied
me
i
could
not
think
long
or
much
my
way
it
seemed
was
feeling
ask
yourself
always
how
what
you
do
will
affect
another
fillery
concluded
that
a
safe
rule
for
you
that
is
of
children
i
observed
we
stared
at
each
other
a
moment
both
sides
keep
it
i
asked
childish
he
agreed
it
certainly
is
both
sides
yes
keep
it
i
sighed
and
the
sigh
seemed
to
rise
from
my
very
feet
passing
through
my
whole
being
he
looked
at
me
most
kindly
then
asking
why
i
sighed
i
used
to
be
free
i
told
him
this
is
not
liberty
and
why
are
we
not
all
free
together
it
is
liberty
for
two
instead
of
only
for
one
he
said
and
so
in
the
long
run
liberty
for
all
so
that
where
they
are
i
remarked
but
to
myself
and
not
to
him
not
further
than
that
for
what
i
had
once
known
but
now
it
seemed
forgotten
was
far
beyond
such
a
foolish
little
game
we
had
lived
without
such
tiny
tricks
we
lived
openly
and
unafraid
we
worked
in
harmony
we
lived
yes
but
who
was
we
that
was
the
part
i
had
forgotten
it
the
growth
and
development
of
civilization
i
heard
the
little
drift
of
wind
go
whistling
thinly
and
it
wo
take
you
long
to
become
quite
civilized
at
this
rate
more
civilized
indeed
than
most
with
your
swift
intelligence
and
lightning
insight
civilization
i
repeated
to
myself
then
i
looked
at
his
eyes
which
hid
carefully
in
their
depths
somewhere
that
tiny
cherished
flame
i
loved
your
ways
are
really
very
simple
i
said
it
all
easy
enough
to
learn
it
is
so
small
a
man
studying
ants
he
tinkled
finds
them
small
but
far
from
simple
you
may
find
complications
later
if
so
come
to
me
i
promised
him
and
the
fire
gleamed
faintly
in
his
eyes
a
moment
he
entrusted
you
to
me
your
mother
he
added
softly
was
the
woman
he
loved
civilization
i
repeated
for
the
word
set
going
an
odd
new
rhythm
in
me
that
i
rather
liked
and
that
tired
me
less
than
the
other
things
he
said
what
is
it
then
you
are
a
race
you
told
me
a
race
of
human
beings
of
men
and
women
developing
the
comely
ones
are
the
women
together
we
make
up
the
race
and
civilization
is
realizing
that
we
are
a
community
learning
growing
all
its
members
living
for
the
others
as
well
as
for
themselves
fillery
told
me
then
about
men
and
women
and
sex
how
children
are
made
and
what
enormous
and
endless
work
was
necessary
merely
to
keep
them
all
alive
and
clothed
and
sheltered
before
they
could
accomplish
anything
else
of
any
sort
at
all
half
the
labour
of
the
majority
was
simply
to
keep
alive
at
all
it
was
an
ugly
little
system
he
described
much
i
did
not
hear
because
my
thinking
powers
gave
out
some
of
it
gave
me
an
awful
feeling
he
called
pain
the
confusion
and
imperfection
seemed
beyond
repair
even
beyond
the
worth
of
being
part
of
it
of
belonging
to
it
at
all
moreover
the
making
of
children
without
which
the
whole
thing
must
end
gave
me
spasms
of
irritation
he
called
laughter
only
the
comely
ones
and
what
he
told
me
of
them
made
me
want
to
sing
the
men
i
said
but
do
they
see
that
it
is
ugly
and
ludicrous
and
comic
he
helped
me
do
they
know
i
asked
taking
his
unknown
words
that
it
comic
the
glamour
he
said
conceals
it
from
them
to
the
best
among
them
it
is
sacred
even
and
the
comely
ones
it
is
their
chief
mission
he
replied
always
remember
that
sacred
he
fixed
his
kind
eyes
gravely
on
my
face
ah
worship
you
mean
i
said
i
understand
again
we
stared
for
some
minutes
yet
all
are
not
comely
are
they
i
asked
presently
the
fire
again
shone
faintly
in
his
eyes
as
he
watched
me
a
moment
without
answering
it
caught
me
away
i
am
not
sure
i
heard
his
words
but
i
think
they
ran
like
this
that
just
the
point
where
civilization
so
far
has
always
stopped
i
remember
he
ceased
tinkling
then
our
talk
ceased
too
i
was
exhausted
he
told
me
to
remember
what
he
had
said
and
to
lie
down
and
rest
he
rang
the
bell
and
a
man
one
of
the
four
who
had
held
me
came
in
ask
nurse
robbins
to
come
here
a
moment
please
he
said
and
a
moment
later
the
comely
one
entered
softly
and
stood
beside
my
bed
she
did
not
look
at
me
fillery
began
again
his
little
tinkling
wishes
to
apologize
to
you
most
sincerely
nurse
for
his
mistake
he
meant
no
harm
believe
me
there
is
no
danger
in
him
nor
will
he
ever
repeat
it
his
ignorance
of
our
ways
i
must
ask
you
to
believe
oh
it
nothing
sir
she
interrupted
i
quite
forgotten
it
already
and
usually
he
as
good
as
gold
and
perfectly
quiet
she
blushed
glancing
shyly
at
me
with
clear
invitation
it
will
not
recur
repeated
the
doctor
positively
he
has
promised
me
he
is
very
very
sorry
and
ashamed
the
nurse
looked
more
boldly
a
moment
i
saw
her
silver
teeth
i
saw
the
hint
of
soft
fire
in
her
poor
pitiful
eyes
but
far
far
away
and
as
she
thought
safely
hidden
pitiful
one
i
will
not
touch
you
i
said
instantly
i
know
that
you
are
sacred
i
noticed
at
once
that
her
sweet
natural
perfume
increased
about
her
as
i
said
the
words
but
her
eyes
were
lowered
though
she
smiled
a
little
and
her
little
cheeks
grew
coloured
i
saw
her
small
teeth
of
silvery
marble
again
our
work
was
visible
i
liked
it
you
have
promised
me
said
fillery
rising
to
go
out
i
promise
i
said
while
the
comely
one
was
arranging
my
pillows
and
sheets
with
quick
clever
hands
sometimes
touching
my
cheek
on
purpose
as
she
did
so
i
will
not
worship
unless
it
is
commanded
of
me
first
the
increased
sweetness
of
her
smell
will
tell
me
but
indeed
already
i
had
forgotten
her
and
i
no
longer
realized
who
it
was
that
tripped
about
my
bed
doing
numerous
little
things
to
make
me
comfortable
my
friend
the
understanding
one
companion
of
my
big
friend
mason
who
was
dead
also
had
left
the
room
his
twitching
mouth
his
laughter
and
his
shining
eyes
were
gone
i
was
aware
that
the
comely
one
remained
doing
all
manner
of
little
things
about
me
and
my
bed
unnecessary
things
but
my
pity
and
my
worship
were
not
asked
so
i
forgot
her
my
thinking
had
wearied
me
and
my
feeling
was
not
touched
i
began
to
hum
softly
to
myself
my
giant
rhythms
rose
i
went
forth
towards
my
powers
of
wind
and
fire
full
of
my
own
natural
joy
i
forgot
the
race
with
its
men
its
women
its
rules
and
games
its
tiny
tricks
its
civilization
i
was
free
for
a
little
with
my
own
one
detail
interfered
a
little
with
the
rhythms
but
only
for
a
second
and
very
faintly
even
then
the
comely
one
face
grew
dark
he
gone
off
asleep
actually
i
heard
her
mutter
as
she
left
the
room
with
a
fling
of
her
little
skirts
shutting
the
door
behind
her
with
a
bang
that
bang
was
far
away
i
was
already
rising
and
falling
in
that
natural
happy
state
which
to
me
meant
freedom
it
is
hard
to
tell
about
but
that
dear
fillery
knows
i
am
sure
exactly
what
i
know
though
he
has
forgotten
it
he
has
known
us
somewhere
i
feel
he
understands
our
service
but
like
me
he
has
forgotten
too
what
really
happened
to
me
where
did
i
go
what
did
i
see
and
feel
when
my
rhythms
took
me
off
thinking
is
nowhere
in
it
i
can
tell
him
that
i
am
conscious
of
the
sun
one
difficulty
is
that
my
being
here
confuses
me
here
i
am
already
caught
confined
and
straitened
i
am
within
certain
limits
i
can
only
move
in
three
ways
three
measurements
three
dimensions
the
space
i
am
in
here
allows
only
little
rhythms
they
are
coarse
and
slow
and
heavy
and
beat
against
confining
walls
as
it
were
are
thrown
back
cross
and
recross
each
other
so
that
while
they
themselves
grow
less
their
confusion
grows
greater
the
forms
and
outlines
i
can
build
with
them
are
poor
and
clumsy
and
insignificant
spirals
i
can
not
make
then
i
forget
into
these
small
rhythms
i
can
not
compress
myself
the
squeezing
hurts
yet
neither
can
i
make
them
bigger
to
suit
myself
i
would
break
forth
towards
the
sun
thus
i
feel
cramped
confused
and
crippled
it
is
almost
impossible
to
tell
of
my
big
rhythms
for
it
is
an
attempt
to
tell
of
one
thing
in
terms
of
another
how
can
i
fix
fire
and
wind
upon
the
point
of
a
pin
for
instance
and
examine
them
through
a
the
sun
remains
what
i
experience
really
when
i
go
off
into
my
own
freedom
is
release
my
rhythms
are
of
the
sun
they
are
his
messengers
they
are
my
law
they
are
my
life
and
happiness
by
means
of
them
i
fulfill
the
purpose
of
my
being
i
work
so
fillery
calls
it
i
build
that
at
any
rate
is
literally
true
my
thinking
stops
at
that
point
perhaps
but
i
think
i
mean
by
release
that
i
escape
back
from
being
trapped
by
all
these
separate
little
individualities
human
beings
each
working
on
his
own
for
his
own
and
against
all
the
others
escape
from
this
stifling
tangle
into
the
sweep
of
my
big
rhythms
which
work
together
and
in
unison
i
search
for
lost
companions
but
do
not
find
them
the
golden
skins
and
radiant
faces
the
mighty
figures
and
the
splendid
shapes
work
without
effort
however
that
is
another
difference
i
too
work
only
i
work
with
them
and
never
against
them
i
can
draw
upon
them
as
they
can
draw
upon
me
we
do
draw
on
one
another
we
know
harmony
service
is
our
method
and
system
my
dear
fillery
also
wants
to
know
who
we
are
how
can
i
tell
him
the
moment
i
try
to
think
i
seem
to
forget
this
forgetting
indeed
is
one
of
the
limits
against
which
i
bang
myself
so
that
i
am
flung
back
upon
the
tangle
of
tiny
rhythms
which
confuse
and
obliterate
the
very
thing
he
wants
to
know
yet
the
sun
i
never
forget
father
of
fire
and
wind
my
companions
are
lost
temporarily
i
am
shut
off
from
them
it
seems
i
can
not
have
them
and
the
race
at
the
same
time
i
yearn
and
suffer
to
rejoin
them
the
service
we
all
know
together
is
great
joy
of
love
this
love
between
two
isolated
individuals
the
race
counts
the
best
thing
they
have
we
know
nothing
now
here
is
one
thing
i
can
understand
quite
clearly
i
have
watched
and
helped
the
race
as
he
calls
it
for
countless
ages
yet
from
outside
it
never
till
now
have
i
been
inside
its
limits
with
it
and
a
dim
sense
of
having
watched
it
through
a
veil
or
curtain
comes
to
me
i
can
faintly
recall
that
i
tried
to
urge
my
big
rhythms
in
among
its
members
as
great
waves
of
heat
or
sound
might
be
launched
upon
an
i
used
to
try
to
force
and
project
my
vast
rhythms
into
their
tiny
ones
hoping
to
make
these
latter
swell
and
rise
and
grow
but
never
with
success
though
a
few
members
here
and
there
felt
them
and
struggled
to
obey
and
use
their
splendid
swing
the
rest
did
not
seem
to
notice
them
at
all
indeed
they
objected
to
the
struggling
efforts
of
the
few
who
did
feel
them
for
their
own
small
accustomed
rhythms
were
interfered
with
the
few
were
generally
broken
into
little
pieces
and
pushed
violently
out
of
the
way
and
this
made
me
feel
pitiful
i
remember
dimly
because
these
smaller
rhythms
though
insignificant
were
exquisite
they
were
of
extraordinary
beauty
could
they
only
have
been
increased
the
race
that
knew
and
used
them
must
have
changed
my
own
which
though
huge
and
splendid
of
their
kind
lacked
the
intense
perfect
loveliness
of
the
smaller
kind
the
race
had
it
accepted
mine
and
mastered
them
must
have
carried
themselves
and
me
towards
still
mightier
rhythms
which
i
alone
could
never
reach
this
then
is
clear
to
me
though
very
faint
now
fillery
who
can
think
for
a
long
time
instead
of
like
me
for
seconds
only
will
understand
what
i
mean
for
if
i
tell
him
what
we
did
he
may
be
able
to
think
out
what
we
were
your
work
he
asked
me
too
i
not
sure
i
know
what
he
means
by
work
we
were
incessantly
active
but
not
for
ourselves
there
was
no
effort
there
was
easy
and
sure
accomplishment
in
the
sense
that
nothing
could
stop
or
hinder
our
fulfilling
our
own
natures
obstacles
indeed
helped
our
power
and
made
it
greater
for
everything
feeds
fire
and
opposition
adds
to
the
pressure
of
wind
our
main
activity
was
to
make
perfect
forms
we
were
apart
from
this
our
work
was
to
maintain
and
keep
active
all
rhythms
less
than
our
own
yet
of
our
kind
i
speak
of
my
own
kind
alone
we
had
no
desire
to
be
known
outside
our
kind
we
worked
and
moved
and
built
up
swiftly
but
out
of
sight
an
endless
service
you
are
the
powers
behind
what
we
call
nature
then
the
dear
fillery
asked
me
you
operate
behind
growing
things
even
behind
inanimate
things
like
trees
and
stones
and
flowers
your
big
rhythms
as
you
call
them
are
our
laws
of
nature
your
own
particular
department
your
own
elements
evidently
were
heat
and
air
i
could
not
answer
that
but
as
he
said
it
i
saw
in
his
grey
eyes
the
flash
of
fire
which
so
few
of
his
race
possessed
and
i
felt
vaguely
that
he
was
one
of
the
struggling
members
who
was
aware
of
the
big
rhythms
and
who
would
be
put
away
in
little
pieces
later
by
the
rest
it
made
me
pitiful
forget
your
own
tiny
rhythms
i
said
and
come
over
to
us
but
bring
your
tiny
rhythms
with
you
because
they
are
so
exquisitely
lovely
we
shall
increase
them
he
did
not
answer
me
his
mouth
twitched
at
the
corners
and
he
had
an
attack
of
that
irritation
which
he
says
is
relieved
and
expressed
by
laughter
yet
the
face
shone
the
laughter
however
was
a
very
quick
full
natural
answer
all
the
same
it
was
happy
and
enthusiastic
i
saw
that
laughter
made
his
rhythms
bigger
at
once
then
laughter
was
probably
the
means
to
use
it
was
a
sort
of
bridge
your
instantaneous
comprehension
of
our
things
puzzles
me
he
said
you
grasp
our
affairs
in
all
their
relations
so
swiftly
yet
it
is
all
new
to
you
his
voice
and
face
made
me
wish
to
stroke
and
help
him
he
was
so
dear
and
eager
how
do
you
manage
it
he
asked
point
blank
our
things
are
surely
foreign
to
your
nature
but
they
are
of
children
i
told
him
they
are
small
and
so
very
simple
there
are
no
difficulties
your
language
is
block
letters
because
your
as
you
call
it
is
so
limited
it
all
comes
to
me
at
a
glance
i
and
my
kind
can
remember
a
million
tiniest
details
without
effort
he
did
not
laugh
but
his
face
looked
full
of
questions
i
could
not
help
him
further
a
scrap
probably
of
what
you
taught
us
i
heard
him
mumble
though
no
further
questions
came
well
he
went
on
presently
while
i
lay
and
watched
the
pale
fire
slip
in
tiny
waves
about
his
eyes
remember
this
since
our
alphabet
is
so
easy
to
you
follow
it
stick
to
it
do
not
go
outside
it
there
a
good
rule
that
will
save
trouble
for
others
as
well
as
for
yourself
i
remember
and
i
try
but
it
is
not
always
easy
i
get
so
cramped
and
stiff
and
lifeless
with
it
this
sunless
chilly
england
of
course
can
not
feed
you
he
said
the
sense
of
beauty
in
our
race
too
is
very
poor
once
he
suddenly
looked
up
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
my
face
his
manner
became
very
earnest
now
listen
to
me
he
said
i
going
to
read
you
something
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
you
make
of
it
it
private
that
is
i
have
no
right
to
show
it
to
others
but
as
no
one
would
understand
it
with
the
exception
possibly
of
yourself
secrecy
is
not
of
importance
and
his
mouth
twitched
a
little
he
drew
a
sheaf
of
papers
from
an
inner
pocket
and
i
saw
they
were
covered
with
fine
writing
i
laughed
this
writing
always
made
me
laugh
it
was
so
laborious
and
slow
the
writing
i
knew
best
of
course
lay
all
over
and
inside
the
earth
and
skies
the
privacy
also
made
me
laugh
so
strange
seemed
the
idea
to
me
and
so
impossible
this
idea
of
secrecy
it
was
such
an
admission
of
ignorance
i
will
understand
it
quickest
by
reading
it
i
said
i
take
in
a
page
at
once
in
your
block
letters
but
he
preferred
to
read
it
out
himself
so
that
he
could
note
the
effect
upon
me
he
explained
of
definite
passages
he
saw
that
i
guessed
his
purpose
and
we
laughed
together
a
moment
when
you
tire
of
listening
he
said
just
tell
me
and
i
pause
i
gave
him
my
hand
to
hold
it
helps
me
to
stay
here
i
explained
and
he
nodded
as
he
grasped
me
in
his
warm
firm
clasp
it
written
by
one
who
have
known
you
and
your
big
rhythms
though
i
ca
be
sure
he
added
one
of
er
my
patients
wrote
it
someone
who
believed
she
was
in
communication
with
a
kind
of
immense
then
he
began
to
read
in
his
clear
windy
voice
sit
and
weave
i
feel
strange
as
if
i
had
so
much
consciousness
that
words
can
not
explain
it
the
failure
of
others
makes
my
work
more
hard
but
my
own
purposes
never
fail
i
am
associated
with
those
who
need
me
the
universal
doors
are
open
to
me
i
compass
creation
but
already
i
began
to
hum
my
songs
though
to
please
him
i
kept
the
music
low
and
he
dear
fillery
did
not
bid
me
stop
but
only
tightened
his
grasp
upon
my
hand
i
listened
with
pleasure
and
satisfaction
therefore
i
hummed
am
silent
seeking
no
expression
needing
no
communication
satisfied
with
the
life
that
is
in
me
i
do
not
even
wish
to
be
known
about
that
where
your
race
i
put
in
is
to
me
as
children
all
they
do
must
be
shouted
about
so
loud
or
they
think
it
has
not
happened
do
not
wish
to
be
forced
to
obtrude
myself
he
went
on
are
hosts
like
me
we
do
not
want
that
which
does
not
belong
to
us
we
do
not
want
that
hindrance
that
opposition
which
rouses
an
undesirable
consciousness
for
without
that
opposition
we
could
never
have
known
of
disobedience
we
are
formless
the
formless
is
the
real
that
can
not
die
it
is
eternal
again
he
tightened
his
grasp
and
this
time
also
laid
his
eyes
a
moment
on
my
own
over
the
top
of
his
paper
so
that
i
kept
my
music
back
with
a
great
effort
for
it
was
hard
not
to
express
myself
when
my
own
came
calling
in
this
fashion
he
continued
reading
aloud
he
selected
passages
now
instead
of
going
straight
through
the
pages
the
words
helped
memory
in
me
flashes
of
what
i
had
forgotten
came
back
in
sheets
of
colour
and
waves
of
music
the
phrases
built
little
spirals
as
it
were
between
two
states
of
these
two
states
i
now
divined
he
understood
one
perfectly
his
own
and
the
other
mine
partially
yet
he
had
a
little
of
both
i
knew
in
himself
with
me
it
was
similar
only
the
understood
state
was
not
the
same
with
us
to
the
race
of
course
what
he
read
would
have
no
meaning
the
comely
one
and
the
four
figures
i
said
how
they
would
turn
white
and
run
if
they
could
hear
you
showing
their
yellow
teeth
and
dim
eyes
his
face
remained
grave
and
eager
though
i
could
see
the
laughter
running
about
beneath
the
tight
brown
skin
as
he
went
on
reading
his
little
bits
heard
nothing
of
man
and
were
rarely
even
conscious
of
him
although
he
benefited
by
our
work
in
all
that
sustained
and
conditioned
him
the
wise
are
silent
the
foolish
speak
and
the
children
are
thus
led
astray
for
wisdom
is
not
knowledge
it
is
a
realization
of
the
scheme
and
of
one
own
part
in
it
he
took
a
firmer
broader
grip
of
my
hand
as
he
read
the
next
bit
i
felt
the
tremble
of
his
excitement
run
into
my
wrist
and
arm
his
voice
deepened
and
shook
it
was
like
a
little
storm
suddenly
we
heard
man
triumphant
voice
we
became
conscious
of
him
as
an
evolving
entity
our
work
had
told
we
had
built
his
form
and
processes
so
faithfully
we
knew
that
when
he
reached
his
height
we
must
be
submissive
to
his
will
a
gust
of
memory
flashed
by
me
as
i
heard
those
small
but
perfect
exquisite
lovely
rhythms
who
called
me
here
whose
voice
reached
after
me
bringing
me
into
this
undesirable
consciousness
i
cried
aloud
as
the
memory
went
tearing
by
then
vanished
before
i
could
recover
it
at
the
same
time
fillery
let
go
my
hand
and
the
little
bridge
was
snapped
i
felt
what
he
called
pain
it
passed
at
once
i
found
his
hand
again
but
the
bridge
was
not
rebuilt
how
white
his
skin
had
grown
i
noticed
as
i
looked
up
at
his
face
but
the
eyes
shone
grandly
i
shall
find
the
way
i
said
we
shall
go
back
together
to
our
eternal
home
he
went
on
reading
as
though
i
had
not
interrupted
but
i
found
it
less
easy
to
listen
now
i
realized
then
that
he
was
gone
he
had
left
the
room
though
i
had
not
seen
him
go
i
had
been
away
it
was
some
days
ago
that
this
occurred
it
was
a
few
hours
ago
that
i
seized
the
comely
one
and
tried
to
comfort
her
poor
hungry
member
of
this
little
race
but
both
occurrences
help
us
help
dear
fillery
and
myself
to
understand
how
difficult
it
is
to
answer
his
questions
and
tell
him
exactly
what
he
wants
to
know
how
long
o
lord
how
long
i
hear
his
yearning
cry
yet
other
beings
can
not
help
us
they
can
only
tell
us
what
their
own
part
is
after
the
door
had
clicked
i
knew
release
for
a
bit
release
from
a
state
i
partially
understood
and
so
found
irksome
into
another
where
i
felt
at
home
and
so
found
pleasurable
in
the
big
rhythms
my
nature
expressed
itself
apparently
i
rose
seeking
my
lost
companions
they
the
devonham
and
his
busy
little
figures
called
it
sleep
it
may
be
sleep
but
i
find
there
what
i
seek
yet
have
forgotten
and
that
with
me
were
dear
fillery
and
another
a
comely
one
whom
brings
as
though
we
belong
together
and
have
a
common
origin
but
this
other
comely
one
who
is
it
chapter
x
about
a
week
after
the
arrival
of
levallon
in
london
fillery
came
out
of
the
home
one
morning
early
upon
some
uninteresting
private
business
he
had
left
levallon
happy
with
his
books
and
garden
devonham
was
with
him
to
answer
questions
or
direct
his
energies
the
other
cases
in
the
establishment
were
moving
nicely
towards
a
cure
the
november
air
was
clear
and
almost
bright
no
personal
worries
troubled
him
his
mind
felt
free
and
light
it
was
one
of
those
mornings
when
nature
slips
very
close
and
sweet
into
the
heart
so
close
and
sweet
that
the
mind
wonders
why
people
quarrel
and
disagree
when
it
is
so
easy
to
forgive
and
the
planet
seems
but
a
big
lovely
happy
garden
evil
an
impossible
nightmare
and
personal
needs
few
and
simple
he
walked
by
cross
roads
towards
primrose
hill
entering
regent
park
near
the
zoo
an
early
white
frost
was
rapidly
melting
in
the
sun
the
sky
showed
a
faint
tinge
of
blue
he
saw
floating
these
and
a
faint
breeze
that
stirred
the
yellowing
last
leaves
of
autumn
gave
his
heart
a
sudden
lift
and
this
lift
was
in
the
direction
of
a
forbidden
corner
he
was
aware
of
some
exquisite
far
away
stirring
a
million
flowers
dew
sparkled
streams
splashed
and
murmured
a
valley
gleamed
and
vanished
yet
left
across
his
mind
its
shining
trail
for
this
lift
of
his
heart
made
him
soar
into
a
region
where
it
was
only
too
easy
to
override
temptation
fillery
however
though
his
invisible
being
soared
kept
both
visible
feet
firmly
on
the
ground
the
surface
was
slippery
being
melted
by
the
sun
but
frost
kept
the
earth
hard
and
frozen
underneath
his
balance
never
was
in
danger
he
remained
detached
and
a
spectator
she
walked
beside
him
nevertheless
a
figure
of
purity
and
radiance
perfumed
soft
delicious
she
was
so
ignorant
of
life
that
was
her
wonder
partly
for
beauty
was
her
accident
and
while
admirable
was
not
a
determining
factor
life
in
its
cruder
sense
she
did
not
know
though
moving
through
the
thick
of
it
it
neither
touched
nor
soiled
her
she
brushed
its
dirt
and
dust
aside
as
though
a
atmosphere
surrounded
her
her
emotions
deep
and
searching
had
remained
untorn
a
quality
of
pristine
innocence
belonged
to
her
as
though
in
the
noisy
clamour
of
ambitious
civilized
life
she
remained
still
aware
of
eden
her
grace
her
loveliness
her
simplicity
moved
by
his
side
as
naturally
it
seemed
to
him
as
air
or
perfume
iraida
he
murmured
to
himself
with
a
smile
of
joy
nayan
khilkoff
all
the
men
worship
and
adore
you
yet
respect
you
too
they
can
not
touch
you
you
remain
aloof
unstained
and
remembering
remarks
in
cinema
and
theatre
he
could
have
sung
at
this
mere
thought
of
her
untouched
by
coarseness
something
unearthly
about
your
loveliness
of
soul
a
baby
a
saint
and
to
all
the
men
in
khilkoff
studio
a
mother
where
do
you
really
come
from
whence
do
you
derive
your
lovely
soul
can
have
no
dealings
with
our
common
flesh
how
many
young
fellows
have
you
saved
already
how
many
floundering
characters
redeemed
they
crave
your
earthly
physical
love
instead
you
surprise
and
disappoint
and
shock
them
into
safety
again
by
giving
to
them
love
and
as
he
half
repeated
his
vivid
thoughts
aloud
he
suddenly
saw
her
coming
towards
him
from
the
ornamental
water
and
instantly
wondering
what
he
should
say
to
her
his
mind
contracted
the
thing
in
him
that
sang
went
backward
into
silence
he
put
a
brake
upon
himself
but
he
watched
her
coming
nearer
wondering
what
brought
her
so
luckily
into
regent
park
and
all
the
way
from
chelsea
at
such
an
hour
she
moved
so
lightly
sweetly
she
was
so
intangible
and
lovely
he
feared
her
eyes
her
voice
they
drew
nearer
from
looking
to
right
and
left
he
raised
his
head
she
was
close
quite
close
a
hundred
yards
away
that
walk
that
swing
that
poise
of
head
and
neck
he
could
not
mistake
anywhere
his
whole
being
glowed
thrilled
and
yet
contracted
as
in
pain
a
sentence
about
the
weather
about
her
own
her
father
health
about
his
calling
to
see
them
shortly
rose
to
his
lips
he
turned
his
eyes
away
then
again
looked
up
they
were
now
not
twenty
yards
apart
in
another
moment
he
would
have
raised
his
hat
when
with
a
sensation
of
cold
disappointment
in
him
she
went
past
in
totally
irresponsive
silence
it
was
a
stranger
a
shop
girl
a
charwoman
a
wife
anybody
but
she
whom
he
had
thought
how
could
he
have
been
so
utterly
mistaken
it
amazed
him
it
was
indeed
months
since
they
had
met
yet
his
knowledge
of
her
appearance
was
so
accurate
and
detailed
that
such
an
error
seemed
incredible
he
had
experienced
besides
the
actual
thrill
the
phenomenon
however
was
not
new
to
him
often
had
he
experienced
it
much
as
others
have
he
knew
from
this
that
she
was
somewhere
near
coming
deliciously
deliberately
towards
him
moving
every
minute
firmly
nearer
from
a
point
in
great
london
town
which
she
had
left
just
at
the
precise
moment
which
would
time
her
crossing
his
own
path
later
they
would
meet
presently
if
not
now
fate
had
arranged
all
details
and
something
in
him
was
aware
of
it
before
it
happened
the
phenomenon
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
repeated
twice
again
in
the
next
he
saw
her
on
both
occasions
beyond
the
possibility
of
question
coming
towards
him
yet
each
time
it
was
a
complete
stranger
masquerading
in
her
guise
it
meant
he
knew
that
their
two
minds
hearts
too
he
wondered
with
a
sense
of
secret
happiness
enjoyed
intensely
then
instantly
suppressed
were
wirelessing
to
one
another
across
the
vast
city
and
that
both
transmitter
and
receiver
their
physical
bodies
would
meet
shortly
round
the
corner
or
along
the
crowded
street
strong
currents
of
desiring
thought
he
knew
he
hoped
he
wondered
were
trying
to
shape
the
crude
world
nearer
to
the
heart
desire
causing
the
various
intervening
to
assume
the
desirable
form
and
outline
in
advance
he
reflected
following
the
habit
of
his
eager
mind
this
wireless
discovery
after
all
was
the
discovery
of
a
universal
principle
in
nature
it
was
common
to
all
forms
of
life
a
faint
beginning
of
that
advance
towards
marvellous
intercommunicating
brotherhood
he
had
always
hoped
for
believed
in
even
plants
he
remembered
according
to
bose
then
suddenly
down
baker
street
he
found
her
close
beside
him
she
was
dressed
so
becomingly
so
naturally
that
no
particular
detail
caught
his
eye
although
she
wore
more
colour
than
was
usual
in
the
dull
climate
known
to
english
people
there
was
a
touch
of
fur
and
there
were
flowers
but
these
were
part
of
her
appearance
as
a
whole
and
the
hat
was
so
exactly
right
though
it
was
here
that
englishwomen
generally
went
wrong
that
he
could
not
remember
afterwards
what
it
was
like
it
was
as
suitable
as
natural
hair
it
looked
as
if
she
had
grown
it
the
shining
eyes
were
what
he
chiefly
noticed
they
seemed
to
increase
the
pale
sunlight
in
the
dingy
street
she
was
so
close
that
he
caught
her
perfume
almost
before
he
recognized
her
and
a
sense
of
happiness
invaded
his
whole
being
instantly
as
he
took
the
slender
hand
emerging
from
a
muff
and
held
it
for
a
moment
the
casual
sentences
he
had
half
prepared
fled
like
a
flock
of
birds
surprised
their
eyes
met
and
instantly
the
sun
rose
over
a
far
khaketian
valley
he
was
aware
of
joy
of
peace
of
deep
contentment
london
obliterated
the
entire
world
elsewhere
he
knew
the
thrill
the
ecstasy
of
some
dawn
but
in
that
brief
second
while
he
held
her
hand
and
gazed
into
her
eyes
there
flashed
before
him
a
sudden
apparition
with
lightning
rapidity
this
picture
darted
past
between
them
paused
for
the
tiniest
fraction
of
a
second
and
was
gone
again
so
swiftly
the
figure
shot
across
that
the
very
glance
he
gave
her
was
intercepted
its
angle
changed
its
meaning
altered
he
started
involuntarily
for
he
knew
that
vision
the
bright
rushing
messenger
someone
who
brought
glad
tidings
and
this
time
he
recognized
it
it
was
the
figure
of
the
outward
start
the
slight
wavering
of
the
eyelids
both
were
noticed
though
not
understood
much
less
interpreted
by
the
young
woman
facing
him
you
are
as
much
surprised
as
i
am
he
heard
the
pleasant
voice
before
his
face
i
thought
you
were
abroad
father
and
i
came
back
from
sark
only
yesterday
i
have
left
town
he
replied
it
was
devonham
went
to
switzerland
he
was
thinking
of
her
pleasant
voice
and
wondering
how
a
mere
voice
could
soothe
and
bless
and
comfort
in
this
way
the
picture
of
the
flashing
figure
too
preoccupied
him
his
various
mind
was
ever
busy
with
several
trains
of
thought
at
once
though
all
correlated
why
he
was
wondering
should
that
picture
of
leave
a
sense
of
chill
upon
his
heart
why
had
the
first
radiance
of
this
meeting
thus
already
dimmed
a
little
her
nearness
too
confused
him
as
of
old
making
his
manner
a
trifle
brusque
and
not
quite
natural
until
he
found
his
centre
of
control
again
he
looked
quickly
up
and
down
the
street
moved
aside
to
let
some
people
pass
then
turned
to
the
girl
again
your
holiday
has
done
you
good
iraida
he
said
quietly
i
hope
your
father
enjoyed
it
too
we
both
enjoyed
ourselves
she
answered
watching
him
something
of
a
protective
air
about
her
i
wish
you
had
been
with
us
for
that
would
have
made
it
perfect
i
was
thinking
that
only
this
morning
as
i
walked
across
hyde
park
how
nice
of
you
i
believe
i
too
was
thinking
of
you
both
as
i
walked
through
regent
park
he
smiled
for
the
first
time
it
very
odd
she
went
on
though
you
can
explain
it
probably
she
added
with
a
smile
that
met
his
own
increasing
it
or
at
any
rate
devonham
could
but
i
seen
you
several
times
this
morning
already
in
the
last
i
seen
you
in
other
people
in
the
street
i
mean
yet
i
was
thinking
of
you
at
the
actual
moment
two
months
since
we
met
and
i
imagined
you
were
abroad
odd
yes
he
said
half
shyly
half
curtly
it
an
experience
many
have
i
believe
she
gazed
up
at
him
it
very
natural
i
think
when
people
like
each
other
edward
and
are
in
sympathy
yet
it
happens
with
people
who
do
like
each
other
too
he
objected
and
at
the
same
moment
was
vexed
that
he
had
used
the
words
iraida
khilkoff
laughed
he
had
the
feeling
that
she
read
his
thoughts
as
easily
as
if
they
were
printed
in
red
letters
on
his
grey
felt
hat
there
must
be
bond
between
them
though
she
remarked
an
emotion
i
mean
whatever
it
may
be
even
hatred
probably
nayan
he
agreed
it
you
now
not
devonham
that
wants
to
explain
things
i
think
i
must
take
you
into
the
firm
you
could
take
charge
of
the
female
patients
with
great
success
whereupon
she
looked
up
at
him
with
such
a
grave
mothering
expression
that
he
was
aware
of
her
secret
power
her
central
source
of
strength
in
dealing
with
men
her
innocence
and
truth
were
an
atmosphere
about
her
protecting
her
as
naturally
and
neatly
as
the
clothes
upon
her
body
she
believed
in
men
he
felt
like
a
child
beside
her
i
in
the
firm
already
she
said
for
you
made
me
a
partner
years
ago
when
i
was
so
high
and
her
small
gloved
hand
indicated
the
stature
of
a
little
girl
you
taught
me
first
he
remembered
the
bleak
northern
town
where
fifteen
years
ago
he
had
known
her
father
as
a
patient
for
some
minor
ailment
and
the
friendship
that
grew
out
of
the
relationship
he
remembered
the
child
of
nine
or
ten
who
sat
on
his
knee
and
repeated
to
him
the
russian
fairy
tales
her
mother
told
her
he
recalled
the
charm
the
wonder
the
extraordinary
power
of
belief
her
words
brought
back
again
that
flowered
caucasian
valley
in
the
sunlight
and
this
again
flashed
upon
the
screen
the
strange
bright
figure
that
had
already
once
intercepted
their
glance
as
though
it
somehow
came
between
them
you
have
one
advantage
over
me
he
rejoined
presently
for
in
my
clinique
the
people
know
that
they
need
treatment
whereas
in
the
studio
you
catch
your
patients
unawares
they
do
not
know
they
you
heal
them
without
their
being
aware
that
they
need
healing
yet
some
of
our
have
found
their
way
later
to
your
she
reminded
him
merely
to
finish
what
you
had
first
begun
a
sort
of
convalescence
you
work
in
the
big
raw
world
i
in
a
mere
specialized
corner
of
it
he
turned
away
lest
the
power
in
her
eyes
overcome
him
the
traffic
thundered
past
the
people
crowded
jostling
them
he
could
have
stood
there
talking
to
her
all
day
long
the
london
street
forgotten
or
full
of
flowers
and
eden
trees
and
rippling
summer
streams
the
pale
sunlight
caught
her
face
beside
him
and
made
it
shine
he
longed
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
fly
through
the
dawn
for
ever
for
his
clean
mind
saw
her
without
clothing
her
hair
loose
in
the
wind
her
white
shape
fleeing
from
him
yet
beckoning
across
a
gleaming
shoulder
that
he
must
overtake
and
capture
her
i
on
my
way
to
dunstan
he
heard
the
musical
voice
a
friend
of
father
come
with
me
will
you
and
with
her
muff
she
touched
his
arm
trying
to
make
him
turn
her
way
but
just
as
he
felt
the
touch
he
saw
the
bright
figure
again
swifter
than
himself
and
far
more
powerful
it
leaped
dancing
past
and
carried
her
away
before
his
very
eyes
she
waved
her
hand
her
eyes
faded
like
stars
into
the
distance
of
some
unearthly
spring
and
she
was
gone
a
pang
of
peculiar
anguish
seized
him
as
the
mental
picture
flashed
with
the
speed
of
light
and
vanished
for
the
figure
seemed
of
elemental
power
taking
its
own
with
perfect
ease
he
shook
his
head
i
come
to
see
you
instead
he
told
her
i
come
to
the
studio
in
the
afternoon
if
you
both
be
in
i
like
to
bring
a
friend
with
me
if
i
may
then
she
took
his
hand
and
kept
it
i
shall
expect
you
to
tell
me
all
about
this
friend
i
knew
you
had
something
on
your
mind
for
your
thoughts
have
been
elsewhere
all
the
time
julian
levallon
he
replied
quickly
he
staying
with
me
indefinitely
his
face
grew
stern
a
moment
about
the
mouth
i
think
he
may
need
you
he
added
with
abrupt
significance
julian
levallon
she
repeated
the
name
sounding
very
musical
the
way
her
slightly
foreign
accent
touched
it
and
what
nationality
may
that
be
fillery
hesitated
his
parents
nayan
i
believe
were
english
he
said
he
has
lived
all
his
life
in
the
jura
mountains
alone
with
an
old
scholar
poet
and
geologist
who
brought
him
up
of
our
modern
life
he
knows
little
i
think
you
may
he
broke
off
his
mother
died
when
he
was
born
he
concluded
and
of
women
he
knows
nothing
she
replied
understandingly
so
that
he
will
probably
fall
in
love
with
the
first
he
sees
with
nayan
i
hope
so
nayan
and
he
will
be
safe
with
you
she
watched
her
companion
face
for
a
minute
or
two
with
her
clear
searching
eyes
she
smiled
but
his
own
face
wore
a
mask
now
no
figure
this
time
flashed
between
their
deep
understanding
gaze
a
woman
you
think
can
teach
and
help
him
more
than
a
man
she
said
without
lowering
her
eyes
probably
perhaps
at
any
rate
the
material
i
must
warn
you
at
once
is
new
and
strange
i
want
him
to
meet
you
then
i
in
the
firm
was
all
she
answered
and
you
ca
do
without
me
she
let
go
the
hand
she
had
held
all
this
time
and
turned
from
him
looking
once
across
her
shoulder
as
he
too
went
upon
his
way
about
three
we
shall
expect
you
and
julian
levallon
she
added
the
prometheans
are
coming
too
as
of
course
you
know
but
that
wo
matter
father
has
let
the
studio
to
them
the
more
the
merrier
he
answered
raised
his
hat
and
went
on
at
a
rapid
pace
up
baker
street
but
with
him
up
the
london
street
went
a
flock
of
thoughts
hopes
fears
and
memories
that
were
hard
to
disentangle
lost
forgotten
dreams
went
with
him
too
he
had
known
that
one
day
he
must
be
executed
yet
with
his
own
hands
he
had
just
slipped
the
noose
about
his
neck
detachment
from
life
he
realized
keeping
aloof
from
the
emotions
that
touch
one
fellow
beings
can
only
be
after
all
a
pose
in
his
case
it
was
evidently
a
pose
assumed
for
safety
and
an
artificial
attitude
he
wore
to
keep
his
heart
from
error
his
love
born
of
some
far
unearthly
valley
undoubtedly
consumed
him
while
yet
he
said
it
nay
he
had
himself
suggested
bringing
together
the
girl
and
there
had
been
no
need
to
do
this
yet
he
had
deliberately
offered
it
and
she
had
instantly
accepted
even
while
he
said
the
words
there
was
a
volcano
of
emotion
in
him
several
motives
fighting
to
combine
the
fear
for
himself
being
selfish
he
had
set
aside
at
once
there
was
also
the
fear
for
her
the
odd
certainty
in
him
that
at
last
her
woman
nature
would
be
waked
lastly
the
fear
for
himself
and
here
he
clashed
with
his
promise
to
devonham
behind
the
simple
proposal
lay
these
various
threads
of
motive
emotion
and
qualification
now
as
he
hurried
along
the
street
they
rushed
to
and
fro
about
his
mind
each
at
its
own
speed
and
with
its
own
impetuous
strength
it
was
the
last
one
however
the
certainty
that
her
mere
presence
must
evoke
the
personality
banishing
the
commonplace
levallon
it
was
this
that
in
the
end
perhaps
troubled
him
most
an
intuitive
conviction
assured
him
that
this
was
bound
to
be
the
result
of
their
meeting
levallon
would
sink
down
out
of
sight
would
emerge
triumphant
and
vital
bringing
his
elemental
power
with
him
the
girl
would
summon
him
i
must
tell
paul
first
he
decided
i
must
consult
his
judgment
otherwise
i
breaking
my
promise
if
paul
is
against
it
i
will
send
an
excuse
with
this
proviso
he
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
noting
only
how
clearly
it
revealed
his
own
keen
desire
to
let
levallon
disappear
and
become
active
he
himself
yearned
for
the
interest
stimulus
and
companionship
of
the
strange
new
being
that
was
the
other
aspect
of
the
problem
he
dismissed
quickly
too
he
would
lose
nayan
yes
but
he
had
never
possessed
the
right
to
hold
her
he
was
strong
indifferent
detached
his
life
in
any
case
was
a
sacrifice
upon
the
altar
of
a
mistake
with
regard
to
which
he
had
not
been
consulted
his
whole
existence
must
be
passed
in
worship
before
this
altar
unless
he
was
to
admit
himself
a
failure
his
ideal
possession
of
the
girl
he
consoled
himself
need
know
no
change
to
watch
her
womanhood
hitherto
untouched
by
any
man
to
watch
this
bloom
and
ripen
at
the
bidding
of
another
must
mean
pain
but
he
faced
the
loss
and
a
curious
sense
of
compensation
lay
in
it
somewhere
the
strange
notion
that
she
and
he
would
share
in
a
sense
between
them
he
was
already
aware
of
a
deep
subtle
kinship
between
the
three
of
them
a
kinship
hardly
of
this
physical
world
and
after
all
the
interests
of
must
come
first
he
had
chosen
his
life
accepted
it
at
any
rate
he
must
remain
true
to
his
high
ideal
this
strange
being
blown
by
the
winds
of
chance
into
his
keeping
must
be
his
first
consideration
levallon
needed
no
special
help
neither
from
himself
nor
from
her
nor
from
others
levallon
was
ordinary
enough
if
not
commonplace
his
only
interest
being
at
those
thin
places
in
his
being
where
the
submerged
personality
of
peeped
through
paul
devonham
he
felt
convinced
was
wrong
in
thinking
to
be
the
transient
manifestation
it
was
the
reverse
that
fillery
believed
to
be
the
truth
he
saw
in
almost
a
new
type
of
being
altogether
in
that
physical
body
warred
two
personalities
certainly
but
was
the
important
one
and
levallon
merely
the
transient
outer
one
masquerading
on
the
surface
merely
a
kind
of
automatic
and
mechanical
personality
gleaned
picked
up
trained
and
educated
as
it
were
by
the
few
years
spent
among
the
human
herd
and
this
needed
help
the
best
the
wisest
possible
both
male
and
female
help
demanded
he
edward
fillery
could
supply
the
former
but
the
latter
could
be
furnished
only
by
some
woman
in
whom
innocence
truth
and
a
natural
the
three
deepest
feminine
qualities
were
happily
combined
nayan
possessed
them
all
the
strange
bright
messenger
bringing
perhaps
glad
tidings
into
life
had
need
of
her
and
fillery
as
his
thoughts
ran
down
these
sad
and
happy
paths
of
that
lost
valley
in
his
blood
realized
the
meaning
of
the
flashing
intuition
that
had
pained
yet
gladdened
him
half
an
hour
before
with
its
convincing
symbolic
picture
this
private
eden
secreted
in
his
depths
he
revealed
to
no
one
though
paul
his
intimate
friend
and
keen
assistant
divined
its
general
neighbourhood
and
geography
to
some
extent
it
was
the
girl
who
invariably
opened
its
ivory
gates
for
him
they
had
but
to
meet
and
talk
a
moment
when
with
a
sudden
drift
of
wonder
beauty
wildness
this
khaketian
inheritance
rose
before
him
its
sunny
brilliance
its
flowers
its
perfumes
seduced
and
caught
him
away
the
unearthly
mood
stole
over
him
thought
took
wings
of
imagination
and
soared
beyond
the
planet
he
foresaw
easily
the
effect
she
would
produce
upon
he
came
back
to
earth
again
at
the
door
of
the
home
smiling
as
so
often
before
at
these
brief
wanderings
in
his
secret
eden
yet
perfectly
able
to
the
experience
each
detail
explained
labelled
docketed
and
therefore
harmless
he
found
devonham
in
the
study
and
at
once
told
him
of
his
suggestion
and
its
possible
results
and
his
assistant
resting
before
lunch
after
a
long
morning
work
looked
up
at
him
with
his
quick
observant
air
noticing
the
light
in
the
eyes
the
softer
expression
about
the
mouth
the
general
appearance
of
a
strong
and
recent
stimulus
he
easily
divined
their
origin
and
showed
his
pleasure
in
his
face
he
longed
for
his
old
friend
to
be
humanized
and
steadied
by
some
deep
romance
there
was
a
curious
new
watchful
attitude
also
about
him
though
cleverly
concealed
i
glad
the
khilkoffs
are
back
in
town
he
said
easily
as
for
levallon
he
been
quiet
and
uninteresting
all
the
morning
he
needs
the
human
touch
as
i
already
said
and
the
studio
atmosphere
especially
if
the
prometheans
are
to
be
there
seems
the
very
thing
and
nayan
her
influence
is
good
for
any
man
young
or
old
and
if
levallon
worships
at
her
shrine
like
the
rest
of
so
much
the
better
you
remember
my
notes
nothing
will
help
towards
his
finding
his
real
self
quicker
than
an
abandoned
passion
unreturned
unreturned
you
ca
think
she
will
give
to
levallon
what
so
many
but
may
she
not
the
other
interrupted
stimulate
rather
than
levallon
devonham
was
surprised
he
had
quickly
divined
the
subconscious
fear
and
jealousy
for
this
detached
impersonal
attitude
he
was
not
prepared
only
the
keenest
observer
could
have
noticed
the
sharp
anxious
watchfulness
he
hid
so
well
edward
there
only
one
thing
i
feel
we
you
rather
have
to
be
careful
about
and
the
girl
has
nothing
to
do
with
in
your
blood
remember
lies
an
unearthly
spiritual
vagrancy
which
you
must
not
dare
not
communicate
to
him
if
you
ever
hope
to
see
him
cured
devonham
regarded
him
keenly
as
he
said
it
he
was
as
earnest
as
his
chief
but
the
difference
between
the
two
men
was
fundamental
probably
unbridgeable
as
well
the
affection
trust
respect
each
felt
for
the
other
was
sincere
devonham
however
having
never
known
a
thought
a
feeling
much
less
an
actual
experience
outside
the
normal
gamut
of
humanity
regarded
all
such
as
pathogenic
fillery
who
had
tasted
the
amazing
dangerous
sweetness
of
such
experiences
in
his
own
being
had
another
standard
you
must
not
exaggerate
observed
fillery
slowly
your
phrase
though
is
good
vagrancy
is
an
apt
description
i
admit
yet
to
the
if
it
exists
the
whole
universe
lies
open
remember
too
they
laughed
together
then
suddenly
devonham
rose
and
a
new
inexpressible
uneasiness
was
in
his
face
he
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
his
trouser
pockets
turned
his
eyes
hard
upon
the
floor
stood
with
his
legs
apart
abruptly
turning
he
came
a
full
step
closer
edward
he
said
furious
with
himself
and
yet
fiercely
determined
to
be
honest
i
may
as
well
tell
you
frankly
though
explanation
lies
beyond
me
there
something
in
this
this
case
i
do
quite
like
behind
his
lowered
eyelids
his
observation
never
failed
quick
as
a
flash
his
companion
took
him
up
for
yourself
for
others
or
for
himself
he
asked
while
a
secret
touch
of
joy
ran
through
him
for
myself
perhaps
was
the
immediate
rejoinder
it
intolerable
it
the
panic
sense
he
touches
in
me
i
admit
it
frankly
had
once
or
twice
the
desire
to
turn
and
run
but
what
i
mean
is
we
got
to
be
uncommonly
careful
with
him
he
ended
lamely
levallon
you
refer
to
or
the
panic
sense
repeated
fillery
to
himself
more
than
to
his
friend
the
old
old
thing
i
understand
also
devonham
went
on
presently
i
must
tell
you
that
since
he
came
here
there
been
a
change
in
every
patient
in
the
building
without
exception
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
though
he
heard
a
sound
he
listened
certainly
but
his
mind
was
sharply
centred
on
his
friend
for
the
better
yes
said
fillery
at
once
increased
vitality
noticed
too
precisely
whispered
the
other
still
listening
there
came
a
pause
between
them
and
when
we
have
found
the
real
the
central
self
pursued
fillery
presently
when
we
have
found
the
essential
being
what
is
it
exactly
replied
devonham
with
extraordinary
emphasis
is
it
but
even
then
he
did
not
look
up
to
meet
the
other
glance
chapter
xi
the
meeting
with
fillery
and
his
friends
the
khilkoffs
father
and
daughter
had
for
one
reason
or
another
to
be
postponed
for
a
week
during
which
brief
time
even
no
single
day
wasted
education
proceeded
rapidly
he
was
exceedingly
quick
to
learn
the
usages
of
civilized
society
in
a
big
city
adapting
himself
with
an
ease
born
surely
of
quick
intelligence
to
the
requirements
and
conventions
of
ordinary
life
in
his
perception
of
the
rights
of
others
particularly
he
showed
a
natural
aptitude
he
had
good
manners
that
is
instinctively
in
certain
houses
where
fillery
took
him
purposely
he
behaved
with
a
courtesy
and
tact
that
belong
usually
to
what
england
calls
a
gentleman
except
to
fillery
and
devonham
he
talked
little
but
was
an
excellent
and
sympathetic
listener
a
quality
that
helped
him
to
make
his
way
with
soames
the
stern
and
even
forbidding
matron
he
made
such
headway
that
it
was
noticed
with
a
surprise
including
laughter
he
might
have
been
her
adopted
son
she
got
a
new
pet
said
devonham
with
a
laugh
mason
taught
him
well
his
aptitude
for
natural
history
is
obvious
after
a
few
study
he
make
a
name
for
himself
the
side
will
disappear
now
more
and
more
unless
stimulate
it
for
your
own
ends
he
broke
off
speaking
lightly
still
but
with
a
carelessness
some
might
have
guessed
assumed
you
forget
put
in
his
chief
i
promised
devonham
looked
at
him
shrewdly
i
doubt
he
said
whether
you
can
help
yourself
edward
the
expression
in
his
eyes
for
a
moment
almost
severe
fillery
remained
thoughtful
making
no
immediate
reply
we
must
remember
he
said
presently
that
he
now
in
the
quiescent
state
nothing
has
again
occurred
to
bring
uppermost
again
devonham
turned
upon
his
friend
i
see
no
reason
why
he
spoke
with
emphasis
should
ever
get
uppermost
again
in
my
opinion
we
can
make
this
quiescent
state
levallon
the
permanent
one
we
ca
keep
him
in
a
cage
like
soames
mice
and
parrot
are
you
for
instance
against
my
taking
him
to
the
studio
do
you
think
it
a
mistake
to
let
him
meet
the
prometheans
that
just
where
mason
went
wrong
returned
devonham
he
kept
him
in
a
cage
the
boy
met
only
a
few
peasants
trees
plants
animals
and
birds
the
sun
making
him
feel
happy
became
his
deity
the
rain
he
hated
the
wind
inspired
and
invigorated
him
if
we
now
introduce
the
human
element
wisely
i
see
no
danger
if
he
can
stand
the
khi
the
studio
and
the
prometheans
he
can
stand
anything
he
may
be
considered
cured
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
radiant
figure
with
bright
eyes
and
untidy
shining
hair
came
into
the
room
carrying
an
open
book
soames
says
i
nothing
to
do
with
stars
said
a
deep
musical
voice
and
that
i
had
better
stick
to
animals
and
plants
she
says
that
never
was
good
for
anyone
except
astronomers
who
warn
us
about
tides
eclipses
and
dangerous
comets
he
held
out
the
big
book
open
at
an
enlarged
stellar
photograph
what
please
is
a
galaxy
a
star
that
is
suddenly
brilliant
then
disappears
in
a
few
weeks
and
a
nebula
before
either
of
the
astonished
men
could
answer
levallon
turned
to
devonham
his
face
wearing
the
gravity
and
intense
curiosity
of
a
child
and
please
are
the
only
sort
of
being
in
the
universe
soames
says
that
the
earth
is
the
only
inhabited
place
there
other
beings
besides
you
anywhere
the
earth
is
such
a
little
planet
and
the
solar
system
according
to
this
book
is
one
of
the
smallest
too
my
dear
fellow
devonham
said
gently
do
not
bother
your
head
with
useless
speculations
our
only
valuable
field
of
study
is
this
planet
for
it
is
all
we
know
or
ever
can
know
whether
the
universe
holds
other
beings
or
not
can
be
of
no
importance
to
us
at
present
levallon
stared
fixedly
at
him
saying
nothing
something
of
his
natural
radiance
dimmed
a
little
then
what
are
all
these
things
that
i
remember
i
forgotten
he
asked
his
blue
eyes
troubled
it
will
take
you
all
your
lifetime
to
understand
beings
like
me
and
like
yourself
and
like
fillery
do
waste
time
speculating
about
possible
inhabitants
in
other
stars
he
spoke
but
firmly
as
one
who
laid
down
certain
definite
lines
to
be
followed
while
fillery
watching
made
no
audible
comment
once
long
ago
he
had
asked
his
own
father
a
somewhat
similar
question
but
i
shall
so
soon
get
to
the
end
of
you
replied
levallon
a
disappointed
expression
on
his
face
i
may
speculate
he
asked
when
you
get
to
the
end
of
me
and
of
yourself
and
of
fillery
yes
then
you
may
speculate
to
your
heart
content
said
devonham
in
a
kindly
tone
but
it
will
take
you
longer
than
you
think
perhaps
besides
there
are
women
too
remember
you
will
find
them
more
complicated
still
a
curious
look
stole
into
the
other
eager
eyes
he
turned
suddenly
towards
the
older
man
who
had
his
confidence
so
completely
there
was
in
the
movement
in
the
incipient
gesture
that
he
made
with
his
arms
his
hands
almost
with
his
head
and
face
as
well
something
of
appeal
that
set
the
doctor
nerves
alert
and
the
change
of
voice
it
was
lower
now
and
more
musical
than
before
increased
the
nameless
message
that
flashed
to
his
brain
and
heart
there
was
a
hint
of
song
of
chanting
almost
in
the
tone
there
was
music
in
him
for
the
voice
fillery
realized
suddenly
brought
in
the
somewhat
in
the
way
good
teachers
of
singing
and
voice
production
know
there
was
the
depth
sonority
singing
quality
which
means
that
the
harmonics
are
made
audible
as
with
a
violin
played
in
perfect
tune
the
sound
seemed
produced
not
by
the
vocal
cords
alone
but
by
the
entire
being
so
to
speak
yet
levallon
voice
had
not
this
rich
power
he
noticed
its
appearance
was
a
sign
that
was
stirring
into
activity
and
utterance
women
yes
the
young
man
repeated
to
himself
women
bring
back
something
their
eyes
make
me
remember
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
open
book
upon
the
doctor
knee
it
something
to
do
with
stars
these
memories
he
went
on
eagerly
the
voice
resonant
stars
women
memories
where
are
they
all
gone
to
why
have
i
lost
what
is
it
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
veil
passed
from
his
face
a
thin
transparency
that
dimmed
the
shining
effect
his
hair
and
eyes
and
radiant
health
produced
a
expression
followed
it
devonham
quickly
flashed
the
whispered
warning
and
in
the
same
instant
fillery
rose
holding
out
the
open
book
come
levallon
he
said
putting
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
we
go
into
my
room
for
an
hour
and
i
tell
you
all
about
the
galaxies
and
nebulæ
you
shall
ask
as
many
questions
as
you
like
devonham
is
a
very
busy
man
and
has
duties
to
attend
to
just
now
he
moved
across
to
open
the
door
and
levallon
his
face
changing
more
and
more
went
with
him
the
light
in
his
eyes
increased
he
smiled
the
expression
passed
a
little
devonham
is
quite
right
in
what
he
says
about
useless
speculations
continued
fillery
as
they
went
out
arm
in
arm
together
but
we
can
play
a
bit
with
thought
and
imagination
for
all
that
you
and
i
your
thought
wander
like
an
insect
which
is
allowed
to
fly
in
the
air
but
is
at
the
same
time
confined
by
a
thread
come
along
we
have
an
hour
play
we
travel
together
among
the
golden
stars
eh
play
exclaimed
the
youth
looking
up
with
flashing
eyes
ah
in
the
spring
we
play
our
work
with
sap
roots
crystals
fire
all
finished
out
of
sight
so
that
their
results
followed
of
their
own
accord
he
was
talking
at
great
speed
in
a
low
voice
a
deep
rolling
voice
and
half
to
himself
spring
is
our
holiday
the
forms
made
perfect
and
ready
for
the
power
to
rush
through
and
we
rush
with
it
playing
everywhere
spring
is
the
wine
of
life
yes
put
in
fillery
caught
away
momentarily
by
something
behind
the
words
he
listened
to
as
though
a
rhythm
swept
him
creative
life
racing
up
and
flooding
into
every
form
and
body
everywhere
it
brings
wonder
joy
play
as
you
call
it
we
we
build
the
way
the
youth
broke
off
abruptly
as
they
reached
the
study
door
something
flowed
down
and
back
in
him
emptying
face
and
manner
of
a
mood
which
had
striven
for
utterance
then
passed
he
returned
to
the
previous
talk
about
the
stars
again
who
attends
to
them
who
looks
after
them
he
inquired
a
deep
peculiar
interest
in
his
manner
his
eyes
turning
a
little
darker
what
we
call
the
laws
of
nature
was
the
reply
which
are
after
all
merely
our
formulæ
summing
up
certain
regularities
of
recurrence
the
laws
under
which
they
were
first
set
alight
and
then
sent
whirling
into
space
under
these
same
laws
they
will
all
eventually
burn
out
and
come
to
rest
they
will
be
dead
dead
repeated
the
other
as
though
he
did
not
understand
they
are
the
children
of
the
laws
he
stated
rather
than
asked
are
the
laws
kind
and
faithful
they
never
tire
fillery
explained
with
of
his
nature
and
still
as
to
a
child
the
other
half
of
him
lay
under
firm
restraint
according
to
his
promise
he
outlined
in
general
terms
man
knowledge
of
the
stars
the
laws
never
tire
he
said
but
the
stars
end
they
burn
out
stop
and
die
you
said
so
the
other
replied
with
something
judicious
and
cautious
about
time
and
its
immense
duration
but
he
was
startled
and
those
who
attend
to
the
laws
came
then
the
words
that
startled
him
who
keeps
them
working
so
that
they
do
not
tire
it
was
something
in
the
tone
of
voice
perhaps
that
once
again
produced
in
his
listener
the
extraordinary
sudden
feeling
that
humanity
was
after
all
but
an
insignificant
a
microscopic
detail
in
the
universe
that
it
was
say
a
mere
in
the
colossal
jungle
crowded
with
other
minuter
as
well
as
immenser
life
of
every
sort
and
kind
and
moreover
that
was
aware
of
this
other
life
or
at
least
of
some
vast
section
of
it
and
had
been
if
he
were
not
still
associated
with
it
the
two
letters
by
which
he
was
designated
acquired
a
deeper
meaning
than
before
a
rich
glow
came
into
the
young
face
and
into
the
eyes
growing
ever
darker
a
look
of
burning
the
skin
had
the
effect
of
radiating
the
breathing
became
of
a
sudden
deep
and
rhythmical
the
whole
figure
seemed
to
grow
larger
expanding
as
though
it
extended
already
and
half
filled
the
room
into
the
atmosphere
about
it
poured
as
though
heat
and
light
rushed
through
it
a
strange
effect
of
power
you
like
to
visit
them
perhaps
would
you
asked
fillery
gently
i
feel
began
the
other
then
stopped
short
you
feel
it
would
interest
you
the
doctor
helped
then
saw
his
mistake
i
feel
repeated
the
youth
the
sentence
was
complete
i
am
there
ah
when
you
feel
you
there
you
there
the
other
nodded
he
leaned
forward
know
he
whispered
as
with
sudden
joy
help
me
to
remember
fillery
the
voice
though
whispering
was
strong
it
vibrated
full
of
and
the
sound
of
the
f
was
like
a
wind
in
branches
you
wonderful
know
too
it
is
the
same
with
flowers
with
everything
we
build
with
wind
and
fire
he
stopped
rubbing
a
hand
across
his
forehead
a
moment
wind
and
fire
he
went
on
but
this
time
to
himself
my
splendid
mighty
ones
dropping
his
hand
he
flashed
an
amazing
look
of
enthusiasm
and
power
into
his
companion
face
the
look
held
in
concentrated
form
something
of
the
power
that
seemed
pulsing
and
throbbing
in
his
atmosphere
help
me
to
remember
dear
fillery
his
voice
rang
out
aloud
like
singing
remember
with
me
why
we
both
are
here
when
we
remember
we
can
go
back
where
we
belong
the
glow
went
from
his
face
and
eyes
as
though
an
inner
lamp
had
been
suddenly
extinguished
the
power
left
both
voice
and
atmosphere
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
his
great
sensitive
hands
spread
over
the
table
where
the
star
charts
lay
as
through
the
open
window
came
the
crash
and
clatter
of
an
aeroplane
tearing
like
some
violent
monstrous
insect
through
the
sunlight
a
look
of
pain
came
into
his
eyes
it
goes
again
i
lost
it
we
were
talking
about
the
stars
and
the
laws
of
nature
said
fillery
quickly
though
his
voice
was
shaking
when
that
noisy
disturbed
us
he
leaned
over
taking
his
companion
hand
his
heart
was
beating
he
smelt
the
open
spaces
the
blood
ran
wildly
in
his
veins
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
he
found
simple
common
words
to
use
you
must
not
ask
too
much
at
once
we
will
learn
slowly
there
is
so
much
we
have
to
learn
together
levallon
smile
was
beautiful
but
it
was
the
smile
of
levallon
again
only
thank
you
dear
fillery
he
replied
and
the
talk
continued
as
between
a
tutor
and
his
backward
pupil
but
for
some
time
afterwards
the
tutor
mind
and
heart
while
attending
to
levallon
now
went
travelling
it
seemed
with
there
was
this
strange
division
in
his
being
for
appealed
with
power
to
a
part
of
him
perhaps
the
greatest
that
had
never
yet
found
expression
much
less
satisfaction
many
a
talk
together
of
this
kind
with
occasional
of
he
had
already
enjoyed
with
his
new
patient
and
levallon
was
by
now
fairly
well
instructed
in
the
general
history
of
our
little
world
briefly
but
picturesquely
given
evolution
had
been
outlined
and
explained
the
rise
of
man
sketched
vividly
the
great
war
and
the
planet
present
state
of
chaos
described
in
a
way
that
furnished
a
clear
enough
synopsis
of
where
humanity
now
stood
levallon
was
able
to
hold
his
own
in
conversation
with
others
he
might
pass
for
a
but
not
young
man
and
both
paul
devonham
and
edward
fillery
though
each
for
different
reasons
were
therefore
well
satisfied
with
the
young
human
being
entrusted
to
their
care
a
human
being
to
be
eventually
discharged
from
the
home
healed
and
cured
of
extravagances
made
harmonious
with
himself
able
to
make
his
own
way
in
the
world
alone
to
devonham
it
appeared
already
certain
that
within
a
reasonable
time
levallon
would
find
himself
happily
at
home
among
his
fellow
kind
a
normal
even
a
gifted
young
man
with
a
future
before
him
would
disappear
and
be
forgotten
absorbed
back
into
the
parent
self
to
his
colleague
on
the
other
hand
another
vision
of
his
future
opened
sooner
or
later
it
was
levallon
that
would
disappear
and
remain
in
full
control
a
strange
possibly
a
new
type
of
being
not
alone
marvellously
gifted
but
who
might
even
throw
light
upon
a
vista
of
research
and
knowledge
hitherto
unknown
to
humanity
and
with
benefits
for
the
race
as
yet
beyond
the
reach
of
any
wildest
prophecy
both
men
therefore
went
gladly
with
him
to
the
khilkoff
studio
that
early
november
afternoon
anxious
to
observe
him
his
conduct
attitude
among
the
curious
set
of
people
to
be
found
there
on
the
prometheans
society
day
and
to
note
any
reactions
he
might
show
in
such
a
milieu
each
felt
fully
justified
in
doing
so
though
they
would
have
kept
an
ordinary
hysterical
patient
safely
from
the
place
levallon
however
betrayed
no
trace
of
hysteria
in
any
meaning
of
the
word
big
or
little
he
was
stable
as
a
navvy
betraying
no
undesirable
reaction
to
the
various
danger
points
the
visit
might
be
something
of
an
experiment
perhaps
but
an
experiment
a
test
they
were
justified
in
taking
yet
devonham
on
no
account
would
have
allowed
his
chief
to
go
alone
he
had
insisted
on
accompanying
them
and
to
both
men
as
they
went
towards
chelsea
their
quiet
companion
with
them
came
the
feeling
that
the
visit
might
possibly
prove
one
of
them
right
the
other
wrong
fillery
expected
that
nayan
khilkoff
alone
to
say
nothing
of
the
effect
of
the
other
queer
folk
who
might
be
present
must
surely
evoke
the
personality
now
lying
quiescent
and
inactive
below
the
threshold
of
levallon
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
girl
he
had
never
known
to
fail
with
any
male
for
she
had
that
in
her
which
was
bound
to
stimulate
the
highest
in
the
opposite
sex
the
excitement
of
the
wild
questing
picturesque
if
unbalanced
minds
who
would
fill
the
place
must
also
though
in
quite
another
way
affect
the
self
of
anyone
who
came
in
contact
with
their
fantastic
and
imaginative
atmosphere
attraction
or
repulsion
must
certainly
be
felt
he
expected
at
any
rate
a
vital
clue
ivan
khilkoff
he
told
levallon
as
they
went
along
in
the
car
is
a
russian
a
painter
and
sculptor
of
talent
a
and
silent
sort
of
old
fellow
who
has
remained
very
poor
because
he
refuses
to
advertise
himself
or
commercialize
his
art
and
because
his
work
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
the
english
buy
his
daughter
nayan
teaches
the
piano
and
russian
she
is
beautiful
and
sweet
and
pure
but
of
an
independent
and
rather
impersonal
character
she
has
never
fallen
in
love
for
instance
though
most
men
fall
in
love
with
her
i
hope
you
may
like
and
understand
each
other
thank
you
said
levallon
listening
attentively
but
with
no
great
interest
apparently
i
will
try
very
much
to
like
her
and
her
father
too
the
studio
is
a
very
big
one
it
is
really
two
studios
knocked
into
one
their
living
rooms
opening
out
of
it
one
half
of
the
place
being
so
large
they
sometimes
let
out
for
meetings
dances
and
that
sort
of
thing
earning
a
little
money
in
that
way
it
is
rented
this
evening
by
a
society
called
the
prometheans
a
group
of
people
whose
inquisitive
temperaments
lead
them
to
believe
or
half
believe
to
imagine
if
not
deliberately
to
manufacture
put
in
to
imagine
let
us
call
it
continued
the
other
with
a
twinkle
that
there
are
other
worlds
other
powers
other
states
of
consciousness
and
knowledge
open
to
them
outside
and
beyond
the
present
ones
we
are
familiar
with
they
these
asked
levallon
looking
up
with
signs
of
interest
they
have
experienced
them
they
know
and
experience
replied
fillery
according
to
their
imaginations
and
desires
those
with
a
touch
of
creative
imagination
claiming
the
most
definite
results
those
without
it
being
merely
imitative
they
report
their
experiences
that
is
but
can
not
or
rarely
show
the
results
to
others
you
will
hear
their
talk
and
judge
accordingly
they
are
interesting
enough
in
their
way
they
have
at
any
rate
one
thing
of
value
that
they
are
open
to
new
ideas
such
people
have
existed
in
every
age
of
the
world
history
but
after
an
upheaval
such
as
the
great
war
has
been
they
become
more
active
and
more
numerous
because
the
nervous
system
reacting
from
a
tremendous
strain
produces
exaggeration
any
world
is
better
than
an
uncomfortable
one
in
revolution
they
think
they
are
as
a
rule
sincere
and
honest
folk
they
add
a
touch
of
colour
to
the
commonplace
tuppence
coloured
murmured
devonham
below
his
breath
and
they
believe
so
much
in
other
worlds
to
conquer
other
regions
bigger
states
of
consciousness
other
powers
concluded
fillery
ignoring
the
interruption
that
they
are
half
in
this
world
half
in
the
next
hence
devonham
name
the
name
by
which
he
sometimes
laughs
at
them
of
half
breeds
levallon
eyes
he
saw
were
very
big
his
interest
and
attention
were
excited
they
will
probably
welcome
you
with
open
arms
he
added
if
you
care
to
join
them
they
consider
themselves
pioneers
of
a
larger
life
they
are
not
mere
spiritualists
oh
no
they
are
familiar
with
all
the
newest
theories
and
realize
that
an
alternative
hypothesis
can
explain
all
psychic
phenomena
without
dragging
spirits
in
it
is
in
exaggerating
results
they
go
mostly
wrong
eccentrics
devonham
remarked
out
of
the
circle
and
hysterical
to
a
man
they
accomplish
nothing
they
are
invariably
dreamers
usually
of
doubtful
morals
and
honesty
and
always
unworthy
of
serious
attention
but
they
may
amuse
you
for
an
hour
we
all
find
it
difficult
to
believe
what
we
have
never
experienced
mentioned
fillery
turning
to
his
colleague
with
a
hearty
laugh
in
which
the
latter
readily
joined
for
their
skirmishes
usually
brought
in
laughter
at
the
end
just
now
moreover
they
were
talking
with
a
purpose
and
it
was
wise
and
good
that
levallon
should
listen
and
take
in
what
he
could
hearing
both
sides
he
watched
and
listened
certainly
with
open
eyes
and
ears
as
he
sat
between
them
on
the
wide
front
seat
but
saying
as
usual
very
little
the
car
turned
down
a
narrow
lane
with
slackening
speed
and
slowed
up
before
a
dingy
building
with
faded
virginia
creepers
sprawling
about
stained
dirty
walls
the
neighbourhood
was
depressing
patched
and
dishevelled
and
almost
bordering
on
a
slum
the
november
light
was
passing
into
early
twilight
you
said
levallon
abruptly
turning
round
and
staring
at
devonham
make
everything
seem
unreal
to
me
i
do
not
understand
you
you
know
so
much
why
is
so
little
real
to
you
but
devonham
in
the
act
of
getting
out
of
the
car
made
no
reply
and
probably
had
not
heard
the
words
or
if
he
had
heard
thought
them
more
suitable
for
fillery
chapter
xii
the
prometheans
were
evidently
in
full
attendance
possibly
the
rumour
had
reached
them
that
fillery
was
coming
no
one
announced
the
latter
arrival
there
was
no
servant
visible
the
party
hung
up
their
hats
and
coats
in
a
passage
then
walked
into
the
lofty
studio
which
was
already
filled
with
people
and
the
hum
of
many
voices
at
once
standing
in
a
hesitating
group
beside
the
door
they
were
observed
by
everyone
in
the
room
all
asked
it
seemed
who
is
this
stranger
they
have
brought
fillery
caught
the
curious
atmosphere
in
that
first
moment
an
instant
whiff
as
it
were
of
excitement
interest
something
picturesque
if
possibly
foolish
fantastic
too
yet
faintly
stimulating
breathing
along
his
extremely
sensitive
nerves
he
glanced
at
his
companions
devonham
it
struck
him
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
come
to
supervise
say
a
department
where
the
sales
and
assistants
were
not
satisfactory
or
he
laughed
inwardly
as
the
simile
occurred
to
him
a
entering
a
church
whose
teaching
he
disapproved
even
despised
and
whose
congregation
touched
his
contemptuous
pity
who
would
ever
guess
thought
his
friend
and
colleague
the
sincerity
and
depth
of
knowledge
in
that
insignificant
appearance
paul
hides
his
value
well
he
noticed
in
his
quick
fashion
touched
by
humour
the
hard
challenging
eyes
the
aquiline
nose
on
which
a
pair
of
balanced
uneasily
the
narrow
shoulders
the
poorly
fitting
clothes
the
heart
of
course
remained
invisible
yet
suddenly
he
felt
glad
that
devonham
was
with
him
nothing
unstable
there
he
reflected
and
stability
combined
with
competence
is
rare
this
rapid
judgment
it
occurred
to
him
was
possibly
a
warning
from
his
own
subconscious
being
a
red
flag
signalled
flickered
vanished
he
glanced
next
at
levallon
towering
above
the
other
levallon
was
now
well
dressed
in
london
clothes
that
suited
him
though
for
that
matter
any
clothes
must
have
looked
well
upon
a
male
figure
so
virile
and
upstanding
his
great
shoulders
his
leanness
covered
so
beautifully
with
muscle
his
height
his
colouring
his
radiant
air
above
all
his
strange
big
penetrating
eyes
marked
him
as
a
figure
one
would
notice
anywhere
he
stood
somehow
alone
apart
though
the
ingredients
that
contributed
to
this
strange
air
of
aloofness
would
be
hard
to
define
it
was
chiefly
perhaps
the
poise
of
the
great
powerful
frame
that
helped
towards
this
odd
setting
in
isolation
and
independence
motionless
he
gazed
about
him
quietly
but
it
was
the
way
he
stood
that
singled
him
out
from
other
men
even
in
his
stillness
there
was
grace
neither
hands
nor
feet
though
it
was
difficult
to
describe
exactly
how
he
placed
them
or
used
them
were
separate
from
this
poise
of
perfect
balance
to
put
it
colloquially
he
knew
what
to
do
with
his
extremities
in
sight
of
this
ardent
throng
the
first
he
had
encountered
at
close
intimate
quarters
was
entirely
absent
this
fillery
noticed
instantly
but
other
impressions
followed
during
the
few
brief
seconds
while
they
waited
by
the
door
and
first
the
odd
effect
of
tremendous
power
he
managed
to
convey
nothing
could
have
been
less
aggressive
than
the
tentative
questioning
half
inquiring
half
wondering
attitude
in
which
he
stood
waiting
to
be
introduced
to
the
buzzing
throng
of
humans
yet
there
hung
about
him
like
an
atmosphere
this
potential
strength
of
confidence
of
superiority
even
of
beauty
too
that
not
only
contributed
much
to
the
aloofness
already
mentioned
but
also
contrived
to
make
the
others
men
and
women
in
the
crowded
room
insignificant
somehow
they
seemed
pale
and
ineffective
against
a
larger
grandeur
a
scale
entirely
beyond
their
reach
gigantic
was
the
word
that
leaped
into
the
mind
but
another
perhaps
leaped
with
it
elemental
fillery
was
aware
of
envy
oddly
enough
of
pride
as
well
his
heart
warmed
more
than
ever
to
him
almost
he
could
have
then
and
there
recalled
his
promise
given
to
devonham
cancelling
it
contemptuously
with
a
word
of
for
his
smallness
and
his
lack
of
faith
levallon
aware
of
a
sympathetic
mind
occupied
closely
with
himself
turned
in
that
moment
and
their
eyes
met
squarely
a
smile
of
deep
inner
understanding
passed
swiftly
between
them
over
head
and
shoulders
in
which
moment
exactly
a
short
bearded
man
detaching
himself
from
the
crowd
came
forward
and
greeted
them
with
sincere
pleasure
in
his
voice
and
manner
he
was
lean
his
clothes
hung
loosely
his
glance
was
keen
but
kindly
introductions
followed
and
khilkoff
sharp
eye
rested
for
some
seconds
with
unconcealed
admiration
upon
levallon
as
he
held
his
hand
his
discerning
sculptor
glance
seemed
to
appraise
his
stature
and
proportions
while
he
bade
him
welcome
to
the
studio
his
big
head
and
short
neck
his
mane
of
hair
the
width
of
his
face
with
its
squat
nose
and
high
the
half
ferocious
eyes
the
heavy
jaw
and
something
sprawling
about
the
mouth
gave
him
a
leonine
expression
and
his
voice
was
not
unlike
a
growl
for
all
its
cordiality
a
stir
meanwhile
ran
through
the
room
more
heads
turned
in
their
direction
they
had
long
ago
been
observed
they
were
being
now
examined
nayan
khilkoff
was
saying
while
he
still
held
levallon
hand
as
though
its
size
and
grip
contented
him
had
a
late
russian
lesson
she
will
be
here
shortly
and
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
looking
up
at
levallon
as
the
his
gruffness
and
brevity
had
something
pleasing
in
them
the
studio
is
not
entirely
mine
he
explained
i
want
you
to
come
when
i
alone
some
studies
i
made
in
sark
this
summer
may
interest
you
he
turned
to
fillery
that
lonely
place
was
good
for
both
of
us
he
said
it
gave
me
new
life
and
inspiration
and
nayan
benefited
immensely
too
she
looks
more
like
a
nymph
than
ever
he
shook
hands
with
devonham
smiling
more
grimly
i
surprised
you
too
have
honoured
us
he
exclaimed
with
genuine
surprise
come
to
damn
them
all
as
usual
probably
good
your
and
healthy
criticism
are
needed
in
these
days
cool
cleaning
winds
in
an
conservatory
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
looked
down
at
levallon
hand
he
was
still
holding
he
examined
it
for
a
second
with
care
and
admiration
then
turned
his
eye
upon
the
young
man
figure
he
grunted
when
i
know
you
better
he
said
with
a
growl
of
earnest
meaning
i
shall
ask
a
favour
a
great
favour
of
you
so
beware
thank
you
replied
levallon
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
sculptor
interest
deepened
a
gleam
shone
in
his
eye
you
begun
some
work
said
fillery
and
models
are
hard
to
come
by
i
imagine
his
eye
never
left
levallon
khilkoff
chuckled
he
exclaimed
if
povey
heard
that
he
make
you
join
the
society
at
once
as
honorary
member
or
anything
to
get
you
in
fillery
understands
us
all
well
he
went
on
to
levallon
in
sark
that
lonely
island
in
the
sea
i
began
four
figures
four
elemental
figures
of
earth
air
fire
and
water
a
group
of
course
the
air
figure
i
done
with
nayan
as
model
suggested
fillery
smiling
one
morning
yes
i
caught
her
bathing
from
a
rock
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
no
clothes
on
white
foam
from
the
big
breakers
fluttering
about
her
slim
shining
unconscious
and
half
dancing
fierce
sunlight
all
over
her
ah
he
broke
off
here
povey
coming
i
monopolize
you
all
devonham
you
know
most
of
make
yourselves
at
home
he
turned
to
levallon
again
with
a
touch
of
something
gentler
almost
of
respect
thought
fillery
as
he
noticed
the
delicate
change
of
voice
and
manner
quickly
come
levallon
he
said
courteously
i
should
like
to
show
you
the
figure
as
i
done
it
we
go
for
a
moment
into
my
own
private
rooms
but
it
a
model
for
fire
i
looking
for
as
fillery
guessed
you
may
be
interested
he
led
him
off
levallon
went
with
evident
content
and
the
advance
of
skirmishes
that
were
already
approaching
for
introductions
was
temporarily
defeated
for
the
three
men
standing
by
the
door
had
formed
a
noticeable
group
and
khilkoff
presence
added
to
their
value
fillery
known
and
much
respected
regarded
with
a
touch
of
awe
by
many
had
not
come
for
nothing
it
was
doubtless
argued
his
colleague
moreover
accompanied
him
and
he
too
was
known
to
the
society
though
not
much
cultivated
by
its
members
owing
to
his
downright
critical
way
of
talking
they
deemed
him
prejudiced
unsympathetic
it
was
the
third
member
of
the
group
levallon
who
had
quickly
caught
all
eyes
and
the
attention
immediately
paid
to
him
by
their
host
set
the
value
of
a
special
and
important
guest
upon
him
instantly
all
watched
him
led
away
by
khilkoff
to
the
private
quarters
of
the
studio
where
none
at
first
presumed
to
follow
them
but
it
was
the
eyes
of
the
women
that
remained
glued
to
the
open
door
where
they
had
disappeared
waiting
with
careful
interest
for
their
reappearance
in
particular
lady
gleeson
the
pretty
lady
gleeson
watched
from
the
corner
where
she
sat
alone
sipping
some
refreshment
fillery
and
devonham
having
observed
the
signs
about
them
exchanged
a
glance
their
charge
was
safe
for
the
moment
at
any
rate
they
felt
relieved
yet
it
was
for
the
entry
of
nayan
the
daughter
that
both
waited
with
interest
and
impatience
as
meanwhile
the
bolder
ones
among
the
crowd
came
up
one
by
one
and
captured
them
oh
fillery
i
glad
to
see
you
here
i
thought
you
were
always
too
busy
for
unscientific
people
like
us
yet
in
a
way
all
seekers
are
we
not
i
been
reading
your
physiology
book
and
i
so
want
to
ask
you
about
something
in
it
i
wonder
if
you
mind
he
shook
hands
with
a
woman
wearing
bobbed
hair
and
glasses
and
speaking
with
an
intense
respectful
yet
manner
you
forgotten
me
but
i
understand
you
see
many
people
i
miss
lance
i
sent
you
my
little
magazine
once
and
you
acknowledged
it
sweetly
though
of
course
i
understood
you
had
not
the
time
to
write
for
it
she
continued
for
several
minutes
smiling
up
at
him
her
hands
clasping
and
unclasping
themselves
behind
a
back
clothed
with
some
glittering
coloured
material
that
rather
fascinated
him
by
its
sheen
she
kept
raising
herself
on
her
toes
and
sinking
back
again
in
a
series
of
jerky
rhythms
he
gave
her
his
delightful
smile
oh
dr
fillery
she
exclaimed
with
pleasure
leading
him
to
a
divan
upon
which
he
let
himself
down
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
observe
the
door
from
the
street
as
well
as
the
door
where
levallon
had
disappeared
this
is
really
too
of
you
your
book
set
me
on
fire
simply
her
eyes
wandering
to
the
other
door
and
what
a
wonderful
looking
person
you
brought
with
you
i
fear
it
not
very
easy
reading
he
interposed
patiently
to
me
it
was
too
delightful
for
words
she
rattled
on
pleased
by
the
compliment
implied
i
devour
your
books
and
always
review
them
myself
in
the
magazine
i
would
trust
them
to
anyone
else
i
simply
ca
tell
you
how
physiology
stimulates
me
humanity
needs
imaginative
books
especially
just
now
she
broke
off
with
a
deprecatory
smile
i
do
what
i
can
she
added
as
he
made
no
remark
to
make
them
known
though
in
such
a
very
small
way
i
fear
her
interest
however
was
divided
the
two
powerful
attractions
making
her
quite
incoherent
your
friend
she
ventured
again
he
must
be
eastern
perhaps
or
is
that
merely
sunburn
he
looks
unusual
sunburn
merely
miss
lance
you
must
have
a
chat
with
him
later
oh
thank
you
you
fillery
i
do
so
love
unusual
people
he
listened
gravely
he
was
gentle
while
she
confided
to
him
her
little
inner
hopes
and
dreams
about
the
simple
life
she
introduced
adjectives
she
believed
would
sound
correct
if
spoken
very
quickly
until
between
the
torrent
of
psychical
physiological
and
once
or
twice
psychological
she
became
positively
incoherent
in
a
final
entanglement
from
which
there
was
no
issue
but
a
convulsive
gesture
none
the
less
she
was
bathed
in
bliss
she
monopolized
the
great
man
for
a
whole
ten
minutes
on
a
divan
where
everybody
could
see
that
they
talked
earnestly
intimately
perhaps
even
intellectually
together
side
by
side
he
observed
the
room
meanwhile
without
her
noticing
it
scanning
the
buzzing
throng
with
interest
there
was
confusion
somewhere
something
was
lacking
no
system
prevailed
he
was
aware
of
a
general
sense
of
waiting
for
a
leader
all
looked
he
knew
for
nayan
to
appear
without
her
presence
there
was
no
centre
for
though
not
a
member
of
the
society
herself
she
was
the
heart
always
of
their
gatherings
without
which
they
straggled
somewhat
aimlessly
and
heart
he
remembered
with
a
smile
that
miss
lance
took
proudly
for
herself
was
the
appropriate
word
nayan
mothered
them
they
were
but
children
after
all
when
you
talk
of
a
age
what
do
you
mean
i
wish
you
define
the
term
for
me
devonham
meanwhile
was
saying
to
an
interlocutor
not
far
away
while
with
a
corner
of
his
eye
he
watched
both
fillery
and
the
private
door
he
still
stood
near
the
entrance
looking
more
than
ever
like
a
disapproving
in
a
big
department
store
and
it
was
with
millington
povey
that
he
talked
the
honorary
secretary
of
the
society
the
secretary
had
aimed
at
fillery
but
miss
lance
had
been
too
quick
for
him
he
was
obliged
to
put
up
with
devonham
as
second
best
and
his
temper
suffered
accordingly
he
was
in
aggressive
mood
povey
facing
him
was
talking
with
almost
violent
zeal
a
small
thin
nervous
man
on
the
verge
of
middle
age
his
head
prematurely
bald
with
wildish
tufts
of
patchy
hair
a
thin
scraggy
neck
that
he
lengthened
and
shortened
between
high
hunched
shoulders
povey
resembled
an
eager
vulture
his
keen
bright
eyes
hooked
nose
and
a
habit
of
twisting
head
and
neck
apart
from
his
body
which
held
motionless
increased
this
likeness
to
a
bird
of
prey
possessed
of
considerable
powers
of
organization
he
kept
the
society
together
it
was
he
who
insisted
upon
some
special
psychic
gift
as
a
qualification
of
membership
an
applicant
must
prove
this
gift
to
a
committee
of
povey
choosing
though
these
proofs
were
never
circulated
for
general
reading
in
the
society
reports
talkers
dreamers
faddists
were
not
desired
a
member
must
possess
some
definite
abnormal
power
before
he
could
be
elected
he
must
be
clairvoyant
or
clairaudient
an
automatic
writer
medium
prophet
priest
or
king
members
therefore
stated
their
special
qualification
to
each
other
without
false
modesty
i
a
trance
medium
for
instance
oh
really
see
auras
of
course
while
others
had
written
automatic
poetry
spoken
in
trance
inspirational
speakers
that
is
photographed
a
spirit
appeared
to
someone
at
a
distance
or
dreamed
a
prophetic
dream
that
later
had
come
true
mediums
and
prophetic
dreamers
were
perhaps
the
most
popular
qualifications
to
offer
but
there
were
many
who
remembered
past
lives
and
not
a
few
could
leave
their
bodies
consciously
at
will
memberships
cost
two
guineas
the
hat
was
occasionally
passed
round
for
special
purposes
there
was
a
monthly
dinner
in
soho
when
members
stood
up
like
saved
sinners
at
a
revivalist
meeting
and
gave
personal
testimony
of
conversion
or
related
some
new
strange
incident
the
prometheans
were
full
of
stolen
fire
and
life
among
them
were
ambitious
souls
who
desired
to
start
a
new
religion
deeming
the
church
past
hope
others
like
the
and
telepathists
were
humbler
there
was
an
inner
circle
which
sought
to
revive
the
mysteries
and
gave
very
private
performances
of
dramatic
and
symbolic
kind
based
upon
recovered
secret
knowledge
at
the
solstices
and
equinoxes
new
thought
members
despised
these
believing
nothing
connected
with
the
past
had
value
they
looked
ahead
live
in
the
present
do
it
now
was
their
watchword
astrologers
were
numerous
too
these
cast
horoscopes
or
for
a
small
fee
revealed
one
secret
name
true
colour
lucky
number
day
of
the
week
and
month
and
so
forth
one
lady
had
a
tame
elemental
students
of
magic
and
casters
of
spells
wearers
of
talismans
and
intricate
designs
in
precious
or
inferior
metal
according
to
taste
and
means
were
well
represented
and
one
and
all
believed
of
course
in
spirits
none
however
belonged
to
any
sect
of
the
day
whatever
it
might
be
they
wore
no
labels
they
were
seekers
questers
inquirers
whom
no
set
of
rules
or
dogmas
dared
confine
within
fixed
limits
an
entirely
open
mind
and
no
prejudices
they
prided
themselves
distinguished
them
define
it
in
scientific
terms
this
new
age
i
can
not
replied
povey
in
his
shrill
voice
for
science
deals
only
with
the
examination
of
the
known
yet
you
only
have
to
look
round
you
at
the
world
to
see
its
obvious
signs
humanity
is
changing
new
powers
everywhere
devonham
interrupted
unkindly
before
the
other
could
assume
he
had
proved
something
by
merely
stating
it
what
these
signs
if
i
may
ask
he
questioned
sharply
for
if
you
can
name
them
we
can
examine
them
er
scientifically
he
used
the
word
with
malice
knowing
it
was
ever
on
the
promethean
lips
there
you
are
at
at
once
declared
povey
i
refer
to
hints
intuitions
signs
that
only
the
most
sensitive
among
us
those
with
psychic
divination
with
spiritual
discernment
that
only
the
privileged
and
those
developed
in
advance
of
the
race
can
know
and
instantly
you
produce
your
microscope
as
though
i
offered
you
the
muscles
of
a
tadpole
to
dissect
they
glared
at
one
another
we
shall
never
get
progress
your
way
povey
fumed
withdrawing
his
head
and
neck
between
his
shoulders
returning
to
the
middle
ages
on
the
other
hand
mentioned
devonham
seems
like
advancing
in
a
circle
does
it
devonham
interrupted
a
pretty
girl
with
an
intense
manner
forgive
me
for
breaking
up
your
interesting
talk
but
you
come
so
seldom
you
know
and
there
a
lady
here
who
is
dying
to
be
introduced
she
has
just
seen
crimson
flashing
in
your
aura
and
she
wants
to
ask
do
you
mind
much
she
smiled
so
sweetly
at
him
and
at
povey
too
who
was
said
to
be
engaged
to
her
though
none
believed
it
that
annoyance
was
not
possible
she
says
she
simply
ask
you
if
you
were
feeling
anger
anger
you
know
produces
red
or
crimson
in
one
visible
atmosphere
she
explained
charmingly
she
led
him
off
forgetting
however
her
purpose
since
they
presently
sat
down
side
by
side
in
a
quiet
corner
and
began
to
enjoy
what
seemed
an
interesting
while
the
lady
waited
impatiently
and
observed
them
without
the
aid
of
clairvoyance
from
a
distance
and
qualifications
for
membership
asked
devonham
i
wonder
if
i
may
ask
but
you
laugh
at
me
if
i
told
you
she
answered
simply
fingering
a
silver
talisman
that
hung
from
her
neck
a
star
with
zodiacal
signs
traced
round
a
rose
evidently
i
so
afraid
of
doctors
devonham
shook
his
head
decidedly
asserting
vehemently
his
interest
whereupon
she
told
him
her
little
private
dream
delightfully
without
pose
or
affectation
yet
shyly
and
so
sincerely
that
he
proved
his
assertion
by
a
genuine
interest
and
does
that
protect
you
among
your
daily
troubles
he
asked
pointing
to
her
little
silver
talisman
he
had
already
commented
sympathetically
upon
her
account
of
saving
her
new
puppies
from
drowning
having
dreamed
the
night
before
that
she
saw
them
gasping
in
a
pail
of
water
the
cruel
looking
on
do
you
wear
it
always
or
only
on
special
occasions
like
this
oh
miss
milligan
made
that
she
told
him
blushing
a
little
rather
poor
she
earns
her
living
by
designing
oh
but
i
do
mean
she
tells
you
your
sign
and
works
it
in
metal
for
you
i
bought
one
mine
is
pisces
she
became
earnest
i
was
born
in
pisces
you
see
and
what
does
pisces
do
for
you
he
inquired
remembering
the
heightened
colour
the
sincerity
of
this
rose
mystica
delighted
him
and
he
already
anticipated
her
reply
with
interest
here
he
felt
was
the
credulous
religious
type
in
its
naked
purity
forced
to
believe
in
something
marvellous
well
if
you
wear
your
sign
next
your
skin
it
brings
good
luck
it
makes
the
things
you
want
happen
the
blush
reappeared
becomingly
she
did
not
lower
her
eyes
have
your
things
happened
then
she
hesitated
well
i
had
an
awfully
good
time
ever
since
i
wore
it
proposals
he
asked
gently
dr
devonham
she
exclaimed
how
ever
did
you
guess
she
looked
very
charming
in
her
innocent
confusion
he
laughed
if
you
do
take
it
off
at
once
he
told
her
solemnly
you
may
get
another
it
was
two
in
a
single
week
she
confided
a
little
tremulously
fancy
the
important
thing
then
he
suggested
is
to
wear
your
talisman
at
the
right
moment
and
with
the
right
person
but
she
corrected
him
promptly
oh
no
it
brings
the
right
moment
and
the
right
person
together
do
you
see
and
if
the
other
person
is
a
pisces
person
you
understand
each
other
of
course
at
once
would
that
i
too
were
pisces
he
exclaimed
seeing
that
she
was
flattered
by
his
interest
i
probably
taking
a
sign
at
random
scorpio
no
she
said
with
grave
disappointment
i
afraid
capricornus
you
know
i
can
tell
by
your
nose
and
eyes
and
cleverness
but
i
wanted
really
to
ask
you
she
went
on
half
shyly
if
i
might
she
stuck
fast
you
want
to
know
he
said
glancing
at
her
with
quick
understanding
who
is
he
pointed
to
the
door
is
that
it
she
nodded
her
head
while
a
divine
little
blush
spread
over
her
face
devonham
became
more
interested
why
he
asked
did
he
impress
you
so
she
replied
with
emphasis
and
there
was
something
in
her
earnestness
curiously
convincing
a
sincere
impression
had
been
registered
his
appearance
you
mean
she
nodded
again
the
blush
deepened
but
it
was
not
he
saw
an
ordinary
blush
the
sensitive
young
girl
had
awe
in
her
he
a
friend
of
fillery
he
told
her
a
young
man
who
lived
in
the
wilds
all
his
life
but
tell
me
why
are
you
so
interested
did
he
make
any
particular
impression
on
you
he
watched
her
his
own
thoughts
dropped
back
suddenly
to
a
strange
memory
of
woods
and
mountains
a
sunset
a
blazing
fire
a
hint
of
panic
yes
she
said
her
tone
lower
he
did
something
definite
she
made
no
answer
what
did
you
see
he
persisted
gently
from
woods
and
mountains
memory
stepped
back
to
a
railway
station
and
a
customs
official
her
manner
obviously
truthful
had
deep
wonder
mystery
even
worship
in
it
he
was
aware
of
a
nervous
reaction
he
disliked
almost
a
chill
he
listened
for
her
next
words
with
an
interest
he
could
hardly
account
for
wings
she
replied
an
odd
hush
in
her
voice
i
thought
of
wings
he
seemed
to
carry
me
off
the
earth
with
great
rushing
wings
as
the
wind
blows
a
leaf
it
was
too
lovely
i
felt
like
a
dancing
flame
i
thought
he
was
what
something
in
his
mind
held
its
breath
a
moment
you
laugh
devonham
will
you
i
thought
for
a
second
of
an
angel
her
voice
died
away
for
a
second
the
part
of
his
mood
that
held
its
breath
struggled
between
anger
and
laughter
a
moment
confusion
in
him
there
certainly
was
that
makes
two
in
the
room
he
said
gently
recovering
himself
he
smiled
but
she
did
not
hear
the
playful
compliment
she
did
not
see
the
smile
you
a
delightful
poetic
little
soul
he
added
under
his
breath
watching
the
big
earnest
eyes
whose
rapt
expression
met
his
own
so
honestly
having
made
her
confession
she
was
still
engrossed
absorbed
he
saw
in
her
own
emotion
so
this
was
the
picture
that
levallon
by
his
mere
appearance
alone
left
upon
an
impressionable
young
girl
an
impression
he
realized
that
was
profound
and
true
and
absolute
whatever
value
her
own
individual
interpretation
of
it
might
have
her
mention
of
space
wind
fire
speed
he
noticed
in
particular
off
the
earth
rushing
wind
dancing
flame
an
angel
it
was
easy
of
course
to
jeer
yet
somehow
he
did
not
jeer
at
all
she
relapsed
into
silence
which
proved
how
great
had
been
the
emotional
discharge
accompanying
the
confession
temporarily
exhausting
her
devonham
keenly
registered
the
small
important
details
entertaining
an
angel
unawares
in
a
chelsea
studio
he
said
laughingly
then
reminding
her
presently
that
there
was
a
lady
who
was
dying
to
be
introduced
to
him
made
his
escape
and
for
the
next
ten
minutes
found
himself
listening
to
a
disquisition
on
auras
which
described
visible
atmospheres
whose
colour
changes
with
emotion
radioactivity
the
halo
worn
by
saints
the
effect
of
light
noticed
about
very
good
people
and
of
blackness
that
the
wicked
emanated
and
ending
up
with
the
radiant
atmosphere
that
shone
round
the
figure
of
christ
and
was
believed
to
show
the
most
lovely
and
complicated
geometrical
designs
god
geometrizes
you
doubtless
know
the
ancient
saying
towzer
said
it
like
a
challenge
i
have
heard
it
admitted
her
listener
shortly
his
first
opportunity
of
making
himself
audible
plato
said
some
other
fine
things
too
i
felt
sure
you
were
feeling
cross
just
now
the
lady
went
on
because
i
saw
lines
and
arrows
of
crimson
darting
and
flashing
through
your
aura
while
you
were
talking
to
povey
he
very
annoying
sometimes
is
he
i
often
wonder
where
all
our
subscriptions
go
to
i
never
could
understand
a
can
you
but
devonham
having
noticed
fillery
moving
across
the
room
did
not
answer
even
if
he
heard
the
question
fillery
he
saw
was
now
standing
near
the
door
where
khilkoff
and
levallon
had
disappeared
to
see
the
sculpture
an
oddly
rapt
expression
on
his
face
he
was
talking
with
a
member
called
father
collins
the
buzz
of
voices
the
incessant
kaleidoscope
of
colour
and
moving
figures
made
the
atmosphere
a
little
electric
extricating
himself
with
a
neat
excuse
he
crossed
towards
his
colleague
but
the
latter
was
already
surrounded
before
he
reached
him
a
forest
of
coloured
scarves
odd
coiffures
gleaming
talismans
intervened
he
saw
men
faces
of
intense
eager
preoccupied
expression
old
and
young
long
hair
and
bald
there
was
a
new
perfume
in
the
air
incense
evidently
tea
coffee
lemonade
were
being
served
with
stronger
drink
for
the
few
who
liked
it
and
cigarettes
were
everywhere
the
note
everywhere
was
rather
out
of
the
excited
throng
his
eyes
then
by
chance
apparently
picked
up
the
figure
of
lady
gleeson
smoking
her
cigarette
alone
in
a
big
armchair
a
glass
of
beside
her
she
caught
his
attention
instantly
this
pretty
lady
gleeson
although
personally
he
found
neither
title
nor
adjective
justified
the
dark
hair
framed
a
very
white
skin
the
face
was
shallow
trivial
yet
with
a
direct
intensity
in
the
shining
eyes
that
won
for
her
the
reputation
of
being
attractive
to
certain
men
her
smile
added
to
the
notoriety
she
loved
a
curious
smile
that
lifted
the
lip
oddly
showing
the
little
pointed
teeth
to
him
it
seemed
somehow
a
face
that
had
been
everything
had
been
kissed
out
of
it
the
mouth
the
lips
were
worn
and
barren
in
an
appearance
otherwise
still
young
she
was
very
expensively
dressed
and
deemed
her
legs
of
such
symmetry
that
it
were
a
shame
to
hide
them
clad
in
tight
silk
stockings
and
looking
like
strips
of
polished
steel
they
were
now
visible
almost
to
the
knee
where
the
edge
of
the
skirt
neatly
trimmed
in
fur
cut
them
off
sharply
some
wag
in
the
society
paraphrasing
the
syllables
of
her
name
wittily
if
unkindly
had
christened
her
de
when
she
heard
it
she
was
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
lady
gleeson
too
he
saw
now
was
watching
the
private
door
the
same
moment
as
so
often
occurred
between
himself
and
his
colleague
at
some
significant
point
in
time
and
space
he
was
aware
of
fillery
eye
upon
his
own
across
the
intervening
heads
and
shoulders
fillery
also
had
noticed
that
lady
gleeson
watched
that
door
his
changed
position
in
the
room
was
partly
explained
a
slightly
cynical
smile
touched
devonham
lips
but
vanished
again
quickly
as
he
approached
the
lady
bowed
politely
and
asked
if
he
might
bring
her
some
refreshment
he
was
too
discerning
to
say
more
refreshment
but
she
dotted
every
i
she
had
no
half
tones
thanks
kind
devonham
she
said
in
a
decided
tone
her
voice
thin
a
trifle
husky
yet
not
entirely
unmusical
it
held
a
strange
throaty
quality
it
so
absurdly
light
she
added
holding
out
the
glass
she
first
emptied
the
mystics
do
hold
with
anything
strong
apparently
but
i
tired
and
you
discovered
it
that
clever
of
you
it
do
me
good
he
malevolently
assured
her
that
it
would
who
your
friend
she
asked
point
blank
with
an
air
that
meant
to
have
a
proper
answer
as
he
brought
the
glass
and
took
a
chair
near
her
he
looks
unusual
more
like
a
champion
than
a
visionary
a
sneer
lurked
in
the
voice
she
fixed
her
determined
clear
grey
eyes
upon
his
eyes
sparkling
with
interest
curiosity
in
life
desire
the
quality
of
unmistakable
kind
i
think
i
should
like
to
know
him
perhaps
it
was
mentioned
as
a
favour
to
the
other
devonham
who
disliked
and
disapproved
of
all
these
people
collectively
felt
angry
suddenly
with
fillery
for
having
brought
levallon
among
them
it
was
after
all
a
foolish
experiment
the
atmosphere
was
dangerous
for
anyone
of
unstable
possibly
of
hysterical
temperament
he
had
vengeance
to
discharge
he
answered
with
deliberate
malice
leading
her
on
that
he
might
watch
her
reactions
she
was
so
transparently
sincere
i
hardly
think
levallon
would
interest
you
he
said
lightly
he
is
neither
modern
nor
educated
he
has
spent
his
life
in
the
backwoods
and
knows
nothing
but
plants
and
stars
and
weather
and
animals
you
would
find
him
dull
no
man
with
a
face
and
figure
like
that
can
be
dull
she
said
quickly
her
eyes
alight
he
glanced
at
her
rings
the
jewelry
round
her
neck
her
expensive
gown
that
would
keep
a
patient
for
a
year
or
two
he
remembered
her
millionaire
south
african
husband
who
was
her
foolish
slave
she
lived
he
knew
entirely
for
her
own
small
selfish
pleasure
although
he
meant
to
use
her
his
gorge
rose
he
produced
his
happiest
smile
you
are
a
keen
observer
lady
gleeson
he
remarked
he
does
look
quite
ordinary
i
admit
after
a
pause
he
added
it
a
curious
thing
but
levallon
does
care
for
the
charms
that
we
other
men
succumb
to
so
easily
he
seems
indifferent
what
he
wants
is
knowledge
only
apparently
he
more
interested
in
stars
than
in
girls
rubbish
she
rejoined
he
has
met
any
in
his
woods
that
all
her
directness
rather
disconcerted
him
at
the
same
time
it
charmed
him
a
little
though
he
did
not
know
it
his
dislike
of
the
woman
however
remained
the
idle
rich
annoyed
him
they
were
so
useless
the
fabulous
jewelry
hanging
upon
such
trash
now
stirred
his
bile
he
was
conscious
of
the
lust
for
pleasure
in
her
yet
after
all
he
rather
an
interesting
fellow
perhaps
he
told
her
as
with
an
air
of
sudden
enthusiasm
do
you
know
he
talks
of
rather
wonderful
things
too
mere
dreams
of
course
yet
for
all
that
out
of
the
ordinary
he
has
vague
memories
it
seems
of
another
state
of
existence
altogether
he
speaks
sometimes
of
of
marvellous
women
compared
to
whom
our
women
here
our
little
dolls
seem
commonplace
and
insignificant
and
to
his
keen
enjoyment
lady
gleeson
took
the
bait
with
open
mouth
she
recrossed
her
shapely
legs
she
wriggled
a
little
in
her
chair
her
fingers
began
fidgeting
along
the
priceless
necklace
just
what
i
should
expect
she
replied
in
her
throaty
voice
from
a
young
man
who
looks
as
he
does
she
began
to
play
her
own
cards
then
mentioning
that
her
husband
was
interested
in
fillery
clinique
devonham
however
at
once
headed
her
off
he
described
the
work
of
the
home
with
enthusiasm
it
fortunate
that
fillery
is
rich
he
observed
carelessly
and
can
follow
out
his
own
ideas
exactly
as
he
likes
i
personally
should
never
have
joined
him
had
he
been
dependent
upon
the
mere
philanthropist
how
wise
of
you
she
returned
and
i
should
never
have
joined
this
mad
society
but
for
the
chance
of
coming
across
unusual
people
now
your
levallon
is
one
you
may
introduce
him
to
me
she
repeated
as
an
ultimatum
her
directness
was
the
one
thing
he
admired
in
her
at
her
own
level
she
was
real
he
was
aware
of
the
atmosphere
about
these
meetings
and
realized
that
lady
gleeson
came
in
search
of
excitement
also
that
she
was
too
sincere
to
hide
it
she
wore
her
insignia
unconcealed
her
talisman
was
of
base
metal
the
one
cheap
thing
she
wore
yet
real
this
foolish
woman
after
all
might
be
of
use
unwittingly
she
might
capture
levallon
if
only
for
a
moment
before
nayan
khilkoff
enchanted
him
with
that
wondrous
sweetness
to
which
no
man
could
remain
indifferent
for
he
had
long
ago
divined
the
natural
unspoken
passion
between
his
chief
and
the
daughter
of
his
host
and
with
his
whole
heart
he
desired
to
advance
it
my
husband
too
would
like
to
meet
him
i
sure
he
heard
her
saying
while
he
smiled
at
the
reappearance
of
the
gilded
bait
my
husband
you
know
is
interested
in
spirit
photography
and
unconscious
theories
he
rose
without
even
a
smile
i
try
and
find
him
at
once
he
said
and
bring
him
to
you
i
only
hope
he
added
as
an
afterthought
that
miss
khilkoff
has
monopolized
him
already
she
has
come
lady
gleeson
betrayed
herself
instinctively
she
knew
her
rival
he
saw
with
an
inward
chuckle
as
he
rose
to
fetch
the
desired
male
he
found
him
the
centre
of
a
little
group
just
inside
the
door
leading
into
the
sculptor
private
studio
where
khilkoff
had
evidently
been
showing
his
new
group
of
elemental
figures
fillery
a
few
feet
away
observing
everything
at
close
range
was
still
talking
eagerly
with
father
collins
levallon
and
kempster
the
pacifist
were
in
the
middle
of
an
earnest
talk
of
which
devonham
caught
an
interesting
fragment
kempster
qualification
for
membership
was
an
occasional
display
of
telepathy
he
was
a
neat
little
man
exceedingly
well
dressed
in
fact
for
his
tailor
dummy
appearance
betrayed
that
he
thought
too
much
about
his
personal
appearance
levallon
towering
over
him
like
some
flaming
giant
spoke
quietly
but
with
rare
good
sense
it
seemed
fillery
condensed
education
had
worked
wonders
on
his
mind
devonham
was
astonished
about
the
pair
others
had
collected
listening
sometimes
interjecting
opinions
of
their
own
many
women
among
them
leaning
against
the
furniture
or
sitting
on
cushions
and
movable
divans
on
the
floor
it
was
a
picturesque
little
scene
but
levallon
somehow
dwarfed
the
others
i
really
think
kempster
was
saying
we
might
now
become
a
comfortable
little
power
like
spain
for
instance
enjoy
ourselves
a
bit
live
on
our
splendid
past
and
take
the
sun
in
ease
he
looked
about
him
with
a
smirk
as
though
he
had
himself
played
a
fine
rôle
in
the
splendid
past
levallon
reply
surprised
him
perhaps
but
it
surprised
devonham
still
more
the
real
the
central
self
levallon
he
thought
with
satisfaction
was
waking
and
developing
his
choice
of
words
was
odd
too
no
no
the
english
are
the
leaders
of
the
world
the
best
quality
is
in
you
if
give
up
the
world
goes
down
and
backwards
the
deep
musical
tones
vibrated
through
the
little
room
the
speaker
though
so
quiet
had
the
air
of
a
powerful
athlete
ready
to
strike
his
pose
was
admirable
faces
turned
up
and
stared
there
was
a
murmur
of
approval
we
so
tired
of
that
talk
replied
kempster
no
whit
disconcerted
by
the
evident
signs
of
his
unpopularity
each
race
should
take
its
turn
we
borne
the
white
man
burden
long
enough
why
not
drop
it
and
let
another
nation
do
its
bit
we
earned
a
rest
i
think
his
precise
high
voice
was
persuasive
he
was
a
good
public
speaker
wholly
impervious
to
another
point
of
view
but
the
resonant
tones
of
levallon
rejoinder
seemed
to
bury
him
voice
exquisite
clothes
and
all
there
no
other
unless
you
hand
it
back
to
weaker
shoulders
no
other
race
has
the
qualities
of
generosity
of
big
careless
courage
of
the
unselfish
kind
required
above
all
you
alone
have
the
chivalry
two
things
devonham
noted
as
he
heard
behind
the
natural
resonance
in
the
big
voice
lay
a
curious
deepness
that
made
him
think
of
thunder
a
volume
of
sound
suppressed
potential
roaring
which
if
let
loose
might
overwhelm
submerge
it
belonged
to
an
earnestness
as
yet
unsuspected
in
him
a
strength
of
conviction
based
on
a
great
purpose
that
was
evidently
subconscious
in
him
as
though
he
served
it
belonged
to
it
without
realizing
that
he
did
so
he
stood
there
like
some
new
young
prophet
proclaiming
a
message
not
entirely
his
own
also
he
said
you
in
place
of
the
natural
we
devonham
listened
attentively
here
too
at
any
rate
was
an
exchange
of
ideas
above
the
psychic
level
he
so
disliked
levallon
he
noticed
at
once
showed
no
evidence
of
emotion
though
his
eyes
shone
brightly
and
his
voice
was
earnest
america
began
kempster
but
was
knocked
down
by
a
fact
before
he
could
continue
has
deliberately
made
itself
a
province
again
america
saw
the
ideal
then
drew
back
afraid
it
is
once
more
provincial
cut
off
from
the
planet
a
big
island
again
concerned
with
local
affairs
of
its
own
your
democracy
has
failed
as
it
always
must
put
in
kempster
glad
perhaps
to
shift
the
point
when
he
found
no
ready
answer
the
wider
the
circle
from
which
statesmen
are
drawn
the
lower
the
level
of
ability
we
should
be
patriotic
for
ideas
not
for
places
the
success
of
one
country
means
the
downfall
of
another
that
not
spiritual
he
continued
at
high
speed
but
devonham
missed
the
words
he
was
too
preoccupied
with
the
other
language
penetration
point
of
view
levallon
had
indeed
progressed
there
was
nothing
of
the
alternative
personality
in
this
nothing
of
the
wild
strange
whom
he
called
patriotism
of
course
is
vulgar
rubbish
he
heard
kempster
finishing
his
tirade
it
is
local
provincial
the
world
is
a
whole
but
levallon
did
not
let
him
escape
so
easily
it
was
admirable
really
this
countryman
from
the
woods
and
mountains
had
a
clear
concentrated
mind
he
had
risen
too
whence
came
his
comprehensive
outlook
chivalry
you
call
it
sporting
instinct
is
the
first
essential
of
a
race
that
is
to
lead
the
world
it
is
a
topmost
quality
your
race
has
it
it
has
come
down
even
into
your
play
it
is
instinctive
in
you
more
than
any
other
and
chivalry
is
unselfish
it
is
divine
you
have
conquered
the
sun
the
hot
races
all
obey
you
the
thunder
broke
through
the
strange
but
simple
words
which
in
that
voice
and
with
that
quiet
earnestness
carried
some
weight
of
meaning
in
them
that
print
can
not
convey
the
women
gazed
at
him
with
unconcealed
if
not
with
understanding
admiration
lead
us
inspire
us
at
any
rate
their
eyes
said
plainly
but
love
us
o
love
us
passionately
above
all
devonham
hardly
able
to
believe
his
ears
and
eyes
turned
to
see
if
fillery
had
heard
the
scrap
of
talk
judging
by
the
expression
on
his
face
he
had
not
heard
it
father
collins
seemed
saying
things
that
held
his
attention
too
closely
yet
fillery
for
all
his
apparent
absorption
had
heard
it
though
he
read
it
otherwise
than
his
somewhat
literal
colleague
it
was
nevertheless
an
interesting
revelation
to
him
since
it
proved
to
him
again
how
unreal
levallon
was
how
easily
quickly
this
educated
simulacrum
caught
up
assimilated
and
reproduced
as
his
own
yet
honestly
whatever
was
in
the
air
at
the
moment
for
the
words
he
had
spoken
were
not
his
own
but
fillery
they
lay
or
something
like
them
lay
unuttered
in
fillery
mind
just
at
that
very
moment
yet
even
while
listening
attentively
to
father
collins
his
close
interest
in
levallon
was
so
keen
so
watchful
that
another
portion
of
his
mind
was
listening
to
this
second
conversation
even
taking
part
in
it
inaudibly
levallon
caught
his
language
from
the
air
devonham
made
his
opportunity
leading
levallon
off
to
be
introduced
to
lady
gleeson
who
still
sat
waiting
for
them
on
the
divan
in
the
outer
studio
as
they
made
their
way
through
the
buzzing
throng
into
the
larger
room
devonham
guessed
suddenly
that
lady
gleeson
must
somehow
have
heard
in
advance
that
levallon
would
be
present
her
flair
for
new
men
was
singular
the
sexual
instinct
unduly
developed
seemed
aware
of
its
prey
anywhere
within
a
big
radius
he
owed
his
friend
a
hint
of
guidance
possibly
a
little
woman
he
explained
as
they
crossed
over
who
has
a
weakness
for
big
men
and
will
probably
pay
you
compliments
she
comes
here
to
amuse
herself
with
what
she
calls
freaks
sometimes
she
lends
her
great
house
for
the
meetings
her
husband
a
millionaire
to
which
the
other
in
his
deep
quiet
voice
replied
thank
you
dr
devonham
she
known
as
pretty
lady
gleeson
that
exclaimed
the
other
looking
towards
her
hush
his
companion
warned
him
as
they
approached
lady
gleeson
waiting
with
keen
impatience
saw
them
coming
and
made
her
preparations
the
frown
of
annoyance
at
the
long
delay
was
replaced
by
a
smile
of
welcome
that
lifted
the
upper
lip
on
one
side
only
showing
the
white
even
teeth
with
odd
effect
she
stared
at
levallon
thought
devonham
as
a
wolf
eyes
its
prey
deftly
lowering
her
dress
betraying
thereby
that
she
knew
it
was
too
high
and
a
detail
now
best
omitted
from
the
picture
she
half
rose
from
her
seat
as
they
came
up
the
instinctive
art
of
deference
though
instantly
corrected
did
not
escape
paul
devonham
too
observant
eye
you
were
kind
enough
to
say
i
might
introduce
my
friend
murmured
he
levallon
is
new
to
our
big
london
and
a
stranger
among
all
these
people
levallon
bowed
in
his
calm
dignified
fashion
saying
no
word
but
lady
gleeson
put
her
hand
out
and
finding
his
own
shook
it
with
her
air
of
brilliant
welcome
determination
lay
in
her
smile
and
in
her
gesture
in
her
voice
as
well
as
she
said
familiarly
at
once
but
levallon
how
tall
you
really
you
seem
to
me
a
perfect
giant
she
made
room
for
him
beside
her
on
the
divan
everybody
here
looks
undersized
beside
you
she
became
intense
i
am
six
feet
and
three
inches
he
replied
literally
but
without
expression
in
his
face
there
was
no
smile
he
was
examining
her
as
frankly
as
she
examined
him
devonham
was
examining
the
pair
of
them
the
lack
of
interest
the
cold
indifference
in
levallon
he
reflected
must
put
the
young
woman
on
her
mettle
accustomed
as
she
was
to
quick
submission
in
her
victims
levallon
however
did
not
accept
the
offered
seat
perhaps
he
had
not
noticed
the
invitation
he
showed
no
interest
though
polite
and
gentle
he
towers
over
all
of
us
devonham
put
in
to
help
an
awkward
pause
yet
he
meant
it
more
than
literally
the
empty
prettiness
of
the
shallow
little
face
before
him
the
triviality
of
miss
rosa
mystica
the
cheapness
of
povey
kempster
towzer
the
foolish
air
of
otherworldly
expectancy
in
the
whole
room
of
deliberate
exaggeration
of
eyes
big
with
wonder
for
sensation
as
story
followed
story
all
this
came
upon
him
with
its
note
of
poverty
and
tawdriness
as
he
used
the
words
something
in
the
atmosphere
of
levallon
had
this
effect
whence
did
it
come
he
questioned
puzzled
of
dwarfing
all
about
him
all
london
remember
is
like
this
he
heard
lady
gleeson
saying
a
dangerous
purr
audible
in
the
throaty
voice
do
sit
down
here
and
tell
me
what
you
think
about
it
i
feel
you
do
belong
here
quite
do
you
know
london
cramps
you
does
it
and
you
find
the
women
dull
and
insipid
she
deliberately
made
more
room
patting
the
cushions
invitingly
with
a
flashing
hand
that
alone
thought
devonham
contemptuously
could
have
endowed
at
least
two
big
cliniques
tell
me
about
yourself
levallon
i
dying
to
hear
about
your
life
in
the
woods
and
mountains
do
talk
to
me
i
so
bored
what
followed
surprised
devonham
more
than
any
of
the
three
perhaps
he
ascribed
it
to
what
fillery
had
called
the
natural
gentleman
while
lady
gleeson
doubtless
ascribed
it
to
her
own
personal
witchery
with
that
easy
grace
of
his
he
sat
down
instantly
beside
her
on
the
low
divan
his
height
and
big
frame
contriving
the
awkward
movement
without
a
sign
of
clumsiness
his
indifference
was
obvious
to
devonham
but
the
vain
eyes
of
the
woman
did
not
notice
it
that
better
she
again
welcomed
him
with
a
happy
laugh
she
edged
closer
a
little
now
do
make
yourself
comfortable
she
arranged
the
cushions
again
and
please
tell
me
about
your
wild
life
in
the
forests
or
wherever
it
was
you
know
a
lot
about
the
stars
i
hear
she
devoured
his
face
and
figure
with
her
shining
eyes
the
upper
lip
was
lifted
for
a
second
above
a
gleaming
tooth
devonham
had
the
feeling
she
was
about
to
eat
him
licking
her
lips
already
in
anticipation
he
himself
would
be
dismissed
he
well
knew
in
another
moment
for
lady
gleeson
would
not
tolerate
a
third
person
at
the
meal
before
he
was
sent
about
his
business
however
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
hear
levallon
opening
answer
to
the
foolish
invitation
amazement
filled
him
he
wished
fillery
could
have
heard
it
with
him
seen
the
play
of
expression
on
the
faces
too
the
bewilderment
of
sensational
hunger
for
something
new
in
lady
gleeson
staring
eyes
arrested
instantaneously
the
calm
cold
look
of
power
yet
power
tempered
by
a
touch
of
pity
in
levallon
glance
a
glance
that
was
only
barely
aware
of
her
proximity
he
smiled
as
he
spoke
and
the
smile
increased
his
natural
radiance
he
looked
extraordinarily
handsome
yet
with
a
new
touch
of
strangeness
that
held
even
the
cautious
doctor
momentarily
almost
spellbound
stars
yes
but
i
rarely
see
them
here
in
london
and
they
seem
so
far
away
they
comfort
me
they
bring
me
they
and
women
bring
me
nearest
to
a
condition
that
is
gone
from
me
i
have
lost
it
he
looked
straight
into
her
face
so
that
she
blinked
and
screwed
up
her
eyes
while
her
breathing
came
more
rapidly
but
stars
and
women
he
went
on
his
voice
vibrating
with
music
in
spite
of
its
quietness
remind
me
that
it
is
recoverable
both
give
me
this
sweet
message
i
read
it
in
stars
and
in
the
eyes
of
women
and
it
is
true
because
no
words
convey
it
for
women
can
not
express
themselves
i
see
and
stars
too
are
silent
here
the
same
soft
thunder
as
before
sounded
below
the
gently
spoken
words
lady
gleeson
was
trembling
a
little
she
made
a
movement
by
means
of
which
she
shifted
herself
yet
nearer
to
her
companion
in
what
seemed
a
natural
and
unconscious
way
it
was
doubtless
his
proximity
rather
than
his
words
that
stirred
her
her
face
was
set
though
the
lips
quivered
a
trifle
and
the
voice
was
less
shrill
than
usual
as
she
spoke
holding
out
her
empty
glass
thank
you
devonham
she
said
icily
the
determined
gesture
a
toss
of
the
head
with
the
glare
of
sharp
impatience
in
the
eyes
he
could
not
ignore
yet
he
accepted
his
curt
dismissal
slowly
enough
to
catch
her
murmured
words
to
levallon
how
wonderful
how
wonderful
you
are
and
what
sort
of
women
followed
him
as
he
moved
away
in
his
heart
rose
again
an
uncomfortable
memory
of
a
jura
valley
blazing
in
the
sunset
and
of
a
figure
worshipping
before
a
great
wood
fire
on
the
rocks
he
fancied
he
caught
too
in
the
voice
a
suggestion
of
a
lilt
a
chanting
resonance
that
increased
his
uneasiness
further
one
thing
was
certain
it
was
not
quite
the
ordinary
levallon
that
answered
the
silly
woman
the
reaction
was
of
a
different
kind
was
then
the
other
self
awake
and
stirring
was
it
after
all
as
his
colleague
claimed
allowing
a
considerable
interval
to
pass
he
returned
with
a
glass
of
lemonade
reaching
the
divan
in
its
corner
just
in
time
to
see
a
flashing
hand
withdrawn
quickly
from
levallon
arm
and
to
intercept
a
glance
that
told
him
the
intrigue
evidently
had
not
developed
altogether
according
to
lady
gleeson
plan
although
her
air
was
one
of
confidence
and
keenest
levallon
sat
like
a
marble
figure
cold
indifferent
looking
straight
before
him
listening
if
only
with
half
an
ear
to
a
stream
of
words
whose
import
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
this
devonham
practised
eye
read
in
the
flashing
look
she
shot
at
him
and
in
the
quick
way
she
thanked
him
coffee
dear
devonham
i
asked
for
her
move
was
so
quick
his
desire
to
watch
them
a
moment
longer
together
so
keen
that
for
an
instant
he
appeared
to
hesitate
it
was
more
than
appearance
he
did
hesitate
an
instant
merely
yet
long
enough
for
lady
gleeson
to
shoot
at
him
a
second
swift
glance
of
concentrated
virulence
and
also
long
enough
for
levallon
to
spring
lightly
to
his
feet
take
the
glass
from
his
hand
and
vanish
in
the
direction
of
the
refreshment
table
before
anything
could
prevent
i
will
get
your
coffee
for
you
still
sounded
in
the
air
so
quickly
was
the
adroit
manoeuvre
executed
levallon
had
cleverly
escaped
how
stupid
of
me
said
devonham
quickly
referring
to
the
pretended
mistake
lady
gleeson
made
no
reply
her
inward
fury
betrayed
itself
however
in
the
lips
and
the
hard
glitter
of
her
brilliant
little
eyes
he
wo
be
a
moment
the
other
added
do
you
find
him
interesting
he
not
very
talkative
as
a
rule
but
perhaps
with
you
he
hardly
knew
what
words
he
used
the
look
she
gave
him
stopped
him
so
intense
was
the
bitterness
in
the
eyes
his
interruption
then
must
indeed
have
been
worse
or
better
timed
than
he
had
imagined
she
made
no
pretence
of
speaking
turning
her
glance
in
the
direction
whence
the
coffee
must
presently
appear
she
waited
and
devonham
might
have
been
a
dummy
for
all
the
sign
she
gave
of
his
being
there
he
had
made
an
enemy
for
life
he
felt
a
feeling
confirmed
by
what
almost
immediately
then
followed
neither
the
coffee
nor
its
bearer
came
that
evening
to
pretty
lady
gleeson
in
the
way
she
had
desired
she
laid
the
blame
at
door
for
at
that
moment
as
he
stood
before
her
secretly
enjoying
her
anger
a
little
yet
feeling
foolish
perhaps
as
well
a
chord
sounded
on
the
piano
and
a
hush
passed
instantly
over
the
entire
room
someone
was
about
to
sing
nayan
khilkoff
had
come
in
unnoticed
by
the
door
of
the
private
room
her
singing
invariably
formed
a
part
of
these
entertainments
the
song
too
was
the
one
invariably
asked
for
its
music
written
by
herself
all
talk
and
movement
stopped
at
the
sound
of
the
little
prelude
as
though
a
tap
had
been
turned
off
even
devonham
most
unmusical
of
men
prepared
to
listen
with
enjoyment
he
tried
to
see
nayan
at
the
piano
but
too
many
people
came
between
he
saw
instead
levallon
standing
close
at
his
side
the
cup
of
coffee
in
his
hand
he
had
that
instant
returned
for
lady
gleeson
will
you
pass
it
to
her
who
going
to
sing
he
whispered
all
in
the
same
breath
and
devonham
told
him
as
he
bent
down
to
give
the
cup
nayan
khilkoff
hush
it
a
lovely
song
i
know
it
vagrant
epitaph
they
stood
motionless
to
listen
as
the
pure
voice
of
the
girl
singing
very
simply
but
with
the
sweetness
and
truth
of
sincere
feeling
filled
the
room
every
word
too
was
clearly
audible
change
was
his
mistress
chance
his
counsellor
love
could
not
hold
him
duty
forged
no
chain
the
wide
seas
and
the
mountains
called
him
and
grey
dawns
saw
his
in
the
rain
sweet
hands
might
tremble
aye
but
he
must
go
revel
might
hold
him
for
a
little
space
but
turning
past
the
laughter
and
the
lamps
his
eyes
must
ever
catch
the
luring
face
dear
eyes
might
question
yea
and
melt
again
rare
lips
silently
implore
but
he
must
ever
turn
his
furtive
head
and
hear
that
other
summons
at
the
door
change
was
his
mistress
chance
his
counsellor
the
dark
firs
knew
his
whistle
up
the
trail
why
tarries
he
and
yesternight
adventure
lit
her
stars
without
avail
chapter
xiii
lady
gleeson
owing
to
an
outraged
vanity
and
jealousy
she
was
unable
to
control
missed
the
final
scene
for
before
the
song
was
actually
finished
she
was
gone
being
near
a
passage
that
was
draped
only
by
a
curtain
she
slipped
out
easily
flung
herself
into
a
luxurious
motor
and
vanished
into
the
bleak
autumn
night
she
had
seen
enough
her
little
heart
raged
with
selfish
fury
what
followed
was
told
her
later
by
word
of
mouth
never
could
she
forgive
herself
that
she
had
left
the
studio
before
the
thing
had
happened
she
blamed
devonham
for
that
too
for
levallon
it
appears
having
passed
the
cup
of
coffee
to
her
through
a
third
person
in
itself
an
insult
of
indifference
and
neglect
stood
absorbed
in
the
words
and
music
of
the
song
being
head
and
shoulders
above
the
throng
he
easily
saw
the
girl
at
the
piano
no
one
unless
it
was
fillery
a
few
yards
away
watched
him
as
closely
as
did
devonham
and
lady
gleeson
though
all
three
for
different
reasons
it
was
devonham
however
who
made
the
most
accurate
note
of
what
he
saw
though
fillery
memory
was
possibly
the
truer
since
his
own
inner
being
supplied
the
fuller
and
more
sympathetic
interpretation
levallon
tall
and
poised
stood
there
like
a
great
figure
shaped
in
bronze
he
was
very
calm
his
bright
hair
seemed
to
rise
a
little
his
eyes
steady
and
wondering
gazed
fixedly
his
features
though
set
were
mobile
in
the
sense
that
any
instant
they
might
leap
into
the
alive
and
fluid
expression
of
some
strong
emotion
his
whole
being
in
a
word
stood
at
attention
alert
for
instant
action
of
some
uncontrollable
perhaps
terrific
kind
he
seemed
like
a
glowing
pillar
of
metal
that
must
burst
into
flame
the
very
next
instant
as
a
member
told
lady
gleeson
later
devonham
watched
him
levallon
seemed
transfixed
he
stared
above
the
intervening
tousled
heads
he
drew
a
series
of
deep
breaths
that
squared
his
shoulders
and
made
his
chest
expand
his
very
muscles
ached
apparently
for
instant
action
an
intensity
of
wondering
joy
and
admiration
that
lit
his
face
made
the
eyes
shine
like
stars
he
watched
the
singing
girl
as
a
tiger
watches
the
keeper
who
brings
its
food
the
instant
the
bar
is
up
it
springs
it
leaps
it
carries
off
devours
only
in
this
case
there
were
no
bars
nor
was
the
wild
desire
for
nourishment
of
a
carnal
kind
it
was
companionship
it
was
intercourse
with
his
own
that
he
desired
so
intensely
he
divines
the
motherhood
in
her
thought
fillery
watching
closely
pain
and
happiness
mingled
in
his
heart
the
protective
selfless
upbuilding
power
lies
close
to
nature
and
as
this
flashed
across
him
he
caught
a
glimpse
by
chance
of
its
exact
opposite
in
lady
peering
glittering
eyes
the
destructive
lust
the
selfish
passion
the
bird
of
prey
dark
firs
knew
his
whistle
up
the
the
song
in
that
soft
true
voice
drew
to
its
close
levallon
was
trembling
good
heavens
thought
devonham
is
it
is
it
after
all
waking
rising
to
take
possession
he
too
trembled
it
was
here
that
lady
gleeson
close
intuitive
observer
of
her
escaping
prey
rose
up
and
slipped
away
her
going
hardly
noticed
by
the
hearts
about
her
each
intent
upon
its
own
small
heaven
of
neat
desire
she
went
as
unobtrusively
as
an
animal
that
is
aware
of
untoward
conditions
and
surroundings
showing
her
teeth
feeling
her
claws
yet
knowing
herself
helpless
not
even
devonham
his
mind
ever
keenly
alert
observed
her
going
fillery
alone
conscious
of
levallon
eyes
across
the
room
took
note
of
it
she
left
her
violent
little
will
intent
upon
vengeance
of
a
later
victory
that
she
still
promised
herself
with
concentrated
passion
yet
devonham
though
he
failed
to
notice
the
slim
animal
of
prey
in
exit
noticed
this
that
the
face
he
watched
so
closely
changed
quickly
even
as
he
watched
and
that
the
new
expression
growing
upon
it
as
heat
grows
upon
metal
set
in
a
flame
was
an
expression
he
had
seen
before
he
had
seen
it
in
that
lonely
mountain
valley
where
a
setting
sun
poured
gold
upon
a
burning
pyre
upon
a
dancing
chanting
figure
upon
a
human
face
he
now
watched
in
this
ridiculous
little
chelsea
studio
the
sharpness
of
the
air
the
very
perfume
stole
over
him
as
he
stared
perplexed
excited
and
uneasy
that
strange
wild
innocent
and
tender
face
that
power
that
infinite
yearning
levallon
had
disappeared
it
was
that
stood
and
watched
the
singer
at
the
little
modern
piano
then
with
the
end
of
the
song
came
the
rush
the
bustle
of
applause
the
confusion
of
many
people
rising
trotting
forward
all
talking
at
once
all
moving
towards
the
singer
when
levallon
hitherto
motionless
as
a
statue
suddenly
leaped
past
and
through
them
like
a
vehement
wind
through
a
whirl
of
crackling
dead
leaves
only
his
deft
skilful
movement
of
poise
and
perfect
balance
combined
with
accurate
swiftness
could
have
managed
it
without
bruised
bodies
and
angry
cries
there
was
no
clumsiness
no
visible
effort
no
appearance
of
undue
speed
he
seemed
to
move
quietly
though
he
moved
like
fire
in
a
moment
he
was
by
the
piano
and
nayan
in
the
act
of
rising
from
her
stool
gazed
straight
up
into
his
great
lighted
eyes
it
was
singular
how
all
made
way
for
him
drew
back
looked
on
confusion
threatened
emotion
surged
like
a
rising
sea
without
a
leader
there
might
easily
have
been
tumult
even
a
scene
but
fillery
was
there
his
figure
intervened
at
once
nayan
he
said
in
a
steady
voice
this
is
my
friend
levallon
he
wants
to
thank
you
but
before
she
could
answer
levallon
his
hand
upon
her
arm
said
quickly
yet
so
quietly
that
few
heard
the
actual
words
perhaps
his
voice
resonant
his
eyes
alight
with
joy
you
are
here
too
with
me
with
fillery
we
are
all
exiles
together
but
you
know
the
way
out
the
way
back
you
remember
she
stared
with
delicious
wonder
into
his
eyes
as
he
went
on
o
star
and
woman
your
voice
is
wind
and
fire
come
and
he
tried
to
seize
her
we
wilt
go
back
together
we
work
here
in
vain
his
arms
were
round
her
almost
their
faces
touched
the
girl
rose
instantly
took
a
step
towards
him
then
hung
back
the
stool
fell
over
with
a
crash
a
hubbub
of
voices
rose
in
the
room
behind
povey
kempster
a
dozen
members
with
them
pressed
up
the
women
with
eyes
gaped
and
gasped
over
the
forest
of
intervening
male
shoulders
a
universal
shuffle
followed
the
confusion
was
absurd
and
futile
both
male
and
female
stood
aghast
and
stupid
before
what
they
saw
for
behind
the
mere
words
and
gestures
there
was
something
that
filled
the
little
scene
with
a
strange
shaking
power
touching
the
panic
sense
levallon
lifted
her
across
his
shoulders
the
beautiful
girl
was
radiant
the
man
wore
the
sudden
semblance
of
a
god
their
very
stature
increased
they
stood
alone
yet
fillery
close
by
stood
with
them
there
seemed
a
magic
circle
none
dared
cross
about
the
three
something
immense
unearthly
had
come
into
the
room
bursting
its
little
space
even
devonham
breaking
with
vehemence
through
the
human
ring
came
to
a
sudden
halt
in
a
voice
of
thunder
though
it
was
not
actually
loud
levallon
cried
their
little
personal
loves
they
can
not
understand
he
bore
nayan
in
his
arms
as
wind
might
lift
a
loose
flower
and
whirl
it
aloft
come
back
with
me
come
home
the
sun
forgets
us
here
the
wind
is
silent
there
is
no
fire
our
work
our
service
calls
us
he
turned
to
fillery
you
too
come
his
voice
boomed
like
a
thundering
wind
against
the
astonished
frightened
faces
staring
at
him
it
rose
to
a
cry
of
intense
emotion
we
are
in
little
exile
here
in
our
wrong
place
cut
off
from
the
service
of
our
gods
we
will
go
back
he
started
with
the
girl
flung
across
his
frame
he
took
one
stride
the
others
shuffled
back
with
one
accord
other
summons
at
the
but
edward
you
you
too
it
was
nayan
voice
as
the
girl
clung
willingly
to
the
great
neck
and
arms
the
voice
of
the
girl
all
loved
and
worshipped
and
thought
wonderful
beyond
temptation
it
was
this
familiar
sound
that
ran
through
the
bewildered
startled
throng
like
an
electric
shock
they
could
not
believe
their
eyes
their
ears
they
stood
transfixed
within
their
circle
stood
levallon
holding
the
girl
almost
embracing
her
while
she
lay
helpless
with
happiness
upon
his
huge
enfolding
arms
he
paused
looked
round
at
fillery
a
moment
none
dared
approach
the
men
gazed
wondering
and
with
faculties
arrested
the
women
stared
stock
still
with
beating
hearts
all
felt
a
lifting
splendid
wonder
they
could
not
understand
devonham
mute
and
motionless
before
an
inexplicable
thing
found
himself
bereft
of
judgment
analysis
and
precedent
for
once
both
failed
he
looked
round
in
vain
for
khilkoff
fillery
alone
seemed
master
of
himself
a
look
of
suffering
and
joy
shone
in
his
face
one
hand
lay
steady
upon
levallon
arm
within
the
little
circle
these
three
figures
formed
a
definite
group
filling
the
beholders
for
the
first
time
in
their
psychic
experience
with
the
thrill
of
something
utterly
beyond
their
ken
something
genuine
at
last
for
there
seemed
about
the
group
though
emanating
as
with
shining
power
from
the
figure
of
levallon
chiefly
some
radiating
force
some
elemental
vigour
they
could
not
comprehend
its
presence
made
the
scene
possible
even
right
edward
you
too
what
is
it
o
what
is
it
there
are
flowers
great
winds
i
see
the
fire
a
searching
tenderness
in
her
tone
broke
almost
beyond
the
limits
of
the
known
human
voice
there
swept
over
the
onlookers
a
wave
of
incredible
emotion
then
as
they
saw
levallon
move
towards
them
as
though
he
would
pass
through
them
and
escape
he
seemed
in
that
moment
stupendous
irresistible
he
looked
divine
the
girl
lay
in
his
arms
like
some
young
radiant
child
he
did
not
kiss
her
no
sign
of
a
caress
was
seen
he
did
no
ordinary
human
thing
his
towering
figure
carrying
his
burden
almost
negligently
came
out
of
the
circle
like
a
tide
towards
them
as
one
described
it
later
or
as
a
poem
that
appeared
later
in
simplicity
began
with
his
hair
of
wind
and
his
eyes
of
fire
and
his
face
of
infinite
desire
he
swept
nearer
they
stirred
again
in
a
confused
and
troubled
shuffle
opening
a
way
they
shrank
back
farther
they
shivered
like
crying
shingle
a
vast
wave
draws
back
only
fillery
stood
still
making
no
sign
or
movement
upon
his
face
that
look
of
joy
and
pain
wild
joy
and
searching
pain
no
one
perhaps
but
devonham
understood
wind
and
fire
boomed
levallon
tremendous
voice
we
return
to
our
divine
eternal
service
o
wind
and
fire
we
come
back
at
last
an
immense
rhythm
swept
across
the
room
then
it
was
without
announcement
of
word
or
action
that
nayan
suddenly
leaping
from
the
great
enfolding
arms
stood
upright
between
the
two
figures
one
hand
outstretched
towards
fillery
at
which
moment
emerging
apparently
from
nowhere
khilkoff
appeared
upon
the
scene
during
the
music
he
had
left
the
studio
to
find
certain
sketches
he
wished
to
show
to
levallon
he
had
witnessed
nothing
therefore
of
what
had
just
occurred
he
now
stood
still
staring
in
sheer
surprise
the
people
in
a
ring
gazing
with
excited
rapt
expression
into
the
circle
they
thus
formed
looked
like
an
audience
watching
some
performance
that
dazed
and
stupefied
them
in
which
fillery
levallon
and
nayan
his
own
daughter
were
the
players
he
took
it
for
an
impromptu
charade
perhaps
something
spontaneously
arranged
during
his
absence
yet
he
was
obviously
staggered
as
he
entered
the
girl
had
just
leaped
from
the
arms
that
held
her
and
run
towards
fillery
who
stood
erect
and
motionless
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
and
levallon
wild
splendid
cry
in
that
instant
shook
its
grand
music
across
the
vaulted
room
so
well
acted
so
dramatic
so
real
was
the
scene
thus
interrupted
that
khilkoff
stood
staring
in
silence
thinking
chiefly
as
he
said
afterwards
that
the
young
pose
and
attitude
were
exactly
magnificently
what
he
wanted
for
the
figure
of
fire
and
wind
in
his
elemental
group
this
enthusiastic
thought
with
the
attempt
to
engrave
it
permanently
in
his
memory
filled
his
mind
completely
for
an
instant
when
there
broke
in
upon
it
again
that
resonant
voice
half
cry
half
chant
vibrating
with
depth
and
music
yet
quiet
too
wind
and
fire
my
wind
and
fire
o
sun
your
messengers
are
come
for
us
oh
come
with
power
and
take
us
with
you
its
rhythm
was
gigantic
so
extraordinary
was
the
volume
yet
the
sweetness
too
in
the
voice
though
its
actual
loudness
was
not
great
so
arresting
was
its
quality
that
khilkoff
as
he
put
it
afterwards
thought
he
heard
an
entirely
new
sound
a
sound
his
ears
had
never
known
before
he
like
the
rest
of
the
astonished
audience
was
caught
but
for
an
instant
only
for
at
once
there
followed
another
voice
releasing
the
momentary
spell
and
with
the
accompanying
action
warned
him
that
what
he
saw
was
no
mere
game
of
acting
this
was
real
hear
that
other
summons
at
the
door
her
hands
were
outstretched
her
eyes
alight
with
yearning
she
was
oblivious
of
everyone
but
fillery
levallon
and
herself
and
her
father
then
breaking
through
the
crowding
figures
packed
shoulder
to
shoulder
nearest
to
him
entered
the
circle
his
mind
was
confused
perhaps
for
vague
ideas
of
some
undesirable
hypnotic
influence
of
some
foolish
experiment
that
had
become
too
real
passed
through
it
he
knew
one
thing
only
this
scene
whether
real
or
acted
pretence
or
sincere
must
be
stopped
the
look
on
his
face
entirely
new
and
strange
to
him
was
all
the
evidence
he
needed
he
shouldered
his
way
through
like
an
angry
bear
making
inarticulate
noises
growling
but
before
he
reached
the
actors
before
nayan
reached
side
and
while
the
voice
of
the
girl
and
of
levallon
still
seemed
to
echo
simultaneously
in
the
air
a
new
thing
happened
that
changed
the
scene
completely
in
these
few
brief
seconds
indeed
so
much
was
concentrated
and
with
such
rapidity
that
it
was
small
wonder
the
reports
of
individual
witnesses
differed
afterwards
almost
as
if
each
one
had
seen
a
separate
detail
of
the
crowded
picture
its
incredibility
too
bewildered
minds
accustomed
to
imagined
dreams
rather
than
to
real
action
levallon
at
any
rate
all
agreed
turned
with
that
ease
and
swiftness
peculiarly
his
own
caught
nayan
again
into
the
air
and
with
one
arm
swung
her
back
across
his
shoulder
he
moved
then
so
irresistibly
with
a
great
striding
rush
in
the
direction
of
the
door
into
the
street
and
so
rapidly
that
the
onlookers
once
more
drew
back
instinctively
pell
mell
tumbling
over
each
other
in
their
frightened
haste
this
all
agreed
had
happened
one
second
they
saw
levallon
carrying
the
girl
off
the
next
a
flash
of
intense
and
vivid
brilliance
entered
the
big
studio
flooding
all
detail
with
a
blaze
of
violent
light
there
was
a
loud
report
there
was
a
violent
shock
the
messengers
our
messengers
the
thunder
of
levallon
cry
was
audible
the
same
instant
this
dazzling
splendour
so
sparkling
it
was
almost
painful
became
eclipsed
again
there
was
complete
obliteration
darkness
descended
like
a
blow
an
inky
blackness
reigned
no
single
thing
was
visible
there
came
a
terrific
splitting
sound
the
effect
of
overwhelming
sudden
blackness
was
natural
enough
in
every
mind
danced
still
the
vivid
memory
of
that
last
amazing
picture
they
had
seen
khilkoff
with
alarmed
face
breaking
violently
into
the
circle
where
his
daughter
nayan
swinging
from
those
giant
shoulders
looked
back
imploringly
at
fillery
who
stood
motionless
as
though
carved
in
stone
a
smile
of
curious
happiness
yet
pain
upon
his
features
yet
the
figure
of
levallon
dominated
his
radiant
beauty
his
air
of
superb
strength
his
ease
his
power
his
wild
swiftness
something
unearthly
glowed
about
him
he
looked
a
god
the
extraordinary
idea
flashed
into
fillery
mind
that
some
big
energy
as
of
spaces
lay
about
him
as
though
great
sirius
called
down
along
his
of
distance
into
the
little
tumbled
chelsea
room
this
was
the
picture
set
one
instant
in
dazzling
violet
brilliance
then
drowned
in
blackness
that
still
hung
shining
with
intense
reality
before
every
mind
the
following
confusion
had
a
moment
of
real
and
troubling
panic
women
screamed
some
fell
upon
their
knees
men
called
for
light
various
cries
were
heard
there
was
a
general
roar
to
the
door
all
men
to
the
door
he
controlled
there
an
elemental
in
him
it
was
povey
shrill
tones
that
pierced
strike
a
match
shouted
kempster
the
electric
light
has
fused
stay
where
you
are
do
move
everybody
lightning
the
clear
voice
of
devonham
was
heard
keep
your
heads
it
only
a
thunderstorm
matches
were
struck
extinguished
lit
again
a
patch
of
dim
light
shone
here
and
there
upon
a
throng
of
huddled
people
someone
found
a
candle
that
shed
a
flickering
glare
upon
the
walls
and
ceiling
but
only
made
the
shadows
chiefly
visible
it
was
an
unreal
fantastic
scene
a
moment
later
there
descended
a
hurricane
gust
of
wind
against
the
building
with
splintering
glass
as
though
from
a
hail
of
bullets
that
extinguished
candle
and
matches
and
plunged
the
scene
again
into
total
darkness
a
terrific
clap
of
thunder
followed
immediately
by
a
rushing
sound
of
rain
that
poured
in
a
flood
upon
the
floor
completed
the
scene
of
terror
and
confusion
the
huge
north
window
had
blown
in
the
consternation
was
for
some
moments
dangerous
for
true
panic
may
become
an
unmanageable
thing
and
this
panic
was
unquestionably
real
the
superstitious
thread
that
lies
in
every
human
being
stretched
and
shivered
beginning
to
weave
its
swift
ominous
pattern
the
elements
dominated
the
human
too
completely
just
then
even
for
the
sense
of
wonder
that
was
usually
so
active
in
the
society
mental
to
assert
itself
intelligently
most
of
them
lost
their
heads
all
associated
that
picture
of
levallon
and
the
girl
with
this
terrific
demonstration
of
overpowering
elemental
violence
povey
startled
cry
had
given
them
the
lead
the
human
touch
thus
added
the
flavour
of
something
both
personal
and
supernatural
some
stood
screaming
whimpering
unable
to
move
some
were
numb
others
cried
for
help
not
a
few
remained
on
their
knees
the
name
of
god
was
audible
here
and
there
many
collapsed
and
several
women
fainted
to
one
and
all
came
the
realization
of
that
panic
fear
which
dislocates
and
paralyses
this
was
a
manifestation
of
elemental
power
that
had
intelligence
somewhere
driving
too
suggestively
behind
it
it
was
devonham
and
khilkoff
who
kept
their
heads
and
saved
the
situation
the
sudden
storm
was
indeed
of
extreme
violence
and
ferocity
the
force
of
the
wind
with
the
nearness
of
the
terrible
lightning
and
the
consequent
volume
of
the
overwhelming
thunder
were
certainly
bewildering
but
a
thunderstorm
they
began
to
realize
was
a
thunderstorm
everyone
stay
exactly
where
he
is
suddenly
shouted
khilkoff
through
the
darkness
his
voice
brought
comfort
i
light
candles
in
the
inner
studio
he
did
so
a
moment
later
the
faint
light
was
reassuring
a
pause
in
the
storm
came
to
his
assistance
the
wind
had
passed
the
rain
had
ceased
there
was
no
more
lightning
with
a
whispered
word
to
devonham
he
disappeared
through
the
door
into
the
passage
you
look
after
i
must
find
my
girl
one
by
one
now
called
devonham
take
careful
steps
avoid
the
broken
glass
voices
answered
from
dark
corners
as
the
inner
room
began
to
fill
all
saw
the
candle
light
and
came
to
it
by
degrees
povey
kempster
imson
father
collins
each
man
bring
a
lady
with
him
it
only
a
thunderstorm
keep
your
heads
the
smaller
room
filled
gradually
people
with
white
faces
and
staring
eyes
coming
singly
or
in
couples
within
the
pale
radiance
of
the
flickering
candle
light
feet
splashed
through
pools
of
water
the
furniture
the
clothing
were
soaked
the
heat
in
the
air
despite
the
great
broken
window
was
stifling
one
or
two
women
were
helped
some
were
carried
there
were
cries
and
exclamations
a
noise
of
splintered
glass
being
trodden
on
or
kicked
aside
drinks
were
brought
for
those
who
had
fainted
order
was
restored
bit
by
bit
the
collective
consciousness
resumed
gradually
its
comforting
sway
the
herd
found
strength
in
contact
a
single
cry
in
a
woman
voice
pan
was
among
us
was
instantly
smothered
drowned
in
a
chorus
of
hush
hush
as
though
a
mere
name
might
bring
a
repetition
of
a
terror
none
could
bear
again
the
entire
scene
had
lasted
perhaps
five
minutes
possibly
less
the
violent
storm
that
had
hung
low
over
london
accumulating
probably
for
hours
had
dissipated
itself
in
a
single
prodigious
explosion
and
was
gone
through
the
gaping
north
window
torn
and
shattered
shone
the
stars
more
candles
were
brought
and
lighted
food
and
drink
followed
a
few
cuts
from
broken
glass
were
attended
to
and
calm
in
a
measure
came
back
to
the
battered
and
shaken
yet
thrilled
and
delighted
prometheans
but
all
eyes
looked
for
a
couple
who
were
not
there
a
hundred
heads
turned
searching
for
in
every
heart
lay
one
chief
question
yet
oddly
enough
none
asked
aloud
the
names
of
nayan
and
levallon
were
not
spoken
audibly
some
touch
of
awe
it
seemed
clung
to
a
memory
still
burning
in
each
individual
mind
it
was
an
awe
that
none
would
willingly
revive
just
then
the
whole
occurrence
had
been
too
devastating
too
sudden
it
all
had
been
too
real
there
was
little
talk
nor
was
there
the
whispered
discussion
even
that
might
have
been
expected
individual
recovery
was
slow
and
hesitating
what
had
happened
lay
still
too
close
for
the
comfort
of
detailed
comparison
or
analysis
by
word
of
mouth
with
common
accord
the
matter
was
avoided
discussions
must
wait
it
would
fill
many
days
with
wonder
afterwards
it
was
with
a
sense
of
general
relief
therefore
that
the
throng
of
guests
bedraggled
somewhat
in
appearance
eyes
still
bright
with
traces
of
uncommon
excitement
their
breath
uneven
and
their
attitude
still
nervous
saw
the
door
into
the
passage
open
and
frame
the
figure
of
their
returning
host
he
held
a
lighted
candle
his
bearded
face
looked
grim
but
his
slow
deep
voice
was
quiet
and
reassuring
he
smiled
his
words
were
commonplace
you
must
excuse
my
daughter
he
said
firmly
but
she
sends
her
excuses
and
begs
to
be
forgiven
for
not
coming
to
bid
you
all
the
lightning
the
electricity
has
upset
her
i
have
advised
her
to
go
to
bed
a
sigh
of
relief
from
everybody
came
in
answer
they
were
only
too
glad
to
take
the
hint
and
go
the
little
impromptu
act
we
had
prepared
for
you
we
can
not
give
now
he
added
anticipating
questions
the
storm
prevented
the
second
part
we
must
give
it
another
time
instead
chapter
xiv
khilkoff
edward
fillery
and
paul
devonham
between
them
it
seems
were
wise
in
their
generation
the
story
spread
that
the
scene
in
the
studio
had
been
nothing
but
a
bit
of
inspired
impromptu
acting
to
which
the
coincidence
of
the
storm
had
lent
a
touch
of
unexpected
conviction
where
otherwise
all
would
have
ended
in
a
laugh
and
a
round
or
two
of
amused
applause
the
spreading
of
an
undesirable
story
thus
was
to
a
great
extent
prevented
its
discussion
remaining
confined
chiefly
among
the
few
startled
witnesses
yet
the
prometheans
of
course
knew
a
supernatural
occurrence
when
they
saw
one
they
were
not
to
be
so
easily
deprived
of
their
treasured
privilege
thrilled
to
their
marrows
individually
and
collectively
they
committed
their
versions
to
writing
drew
up
reports
compared
notes
and
generally
made
the
feast
last
as
long
as
possible
it
was
moreover
a
feast
for
them
its
value
increased
portentously
it
bound
the
society
together
with
fresh
life
it
attracted
many
new
members
povey
and
his
committee
increased
the
subscription
and
announced
an
entrance
fee
in
addition
the
various
accounts
offered
by
the
members
curious
as
these
were
may
be
left
aside
for
the
moment
since
the
version
of
the
occurrence
as
given
by
edward
fillery
comes
first
in
interest
his
report
however
was
made
only
to
himself
he
mentioned
it
in
full
to
no
one
not
even
to
paul
devonham
he
felt
unable
to
share
it
with
any
living
being
only
one
result
of
his
conclusions
he
shared
openly
enough
with
his
assistant
he
withdrew
his
promise
upon
certain
details
the
two
men
agreed
with
interest
that
everybody
in
the
room
men
and
women
were
on
the
the
moment
levallon
made
his
entrance
his
appearance
struck
a
note
all
were
aware
of
an
unusual
presence
interest
and
curiosity
rose
like
a
vapour
heads
all
turned
one
way
as
though
the
same
wind
blew
them
there
was
a
buzz
and
murmur
of
whispered
voices
as
though
the
figure
of
levallon
woke
into
response
the
same
taut
wire
in
every
heart
who
on
earth
is
that
what
is
he
was
legible
in
a
hundred
questioning
eyes
all
in
a
word
were
aware
of
something
unaccustomed
upon
this
detail
and
in
support
of
the
society
claim
to
special
psychic
perception
it
must
be
mentioned
fillery
and
devonham
were
at
one
but
another
detail
too
found
them
in
agreement
it
was
not
the
tempest
that
caused
the
panic
it
was
levallon
himself
something
about
levallon
had
produced
the
abrupt
and
singular
sense
of
panic
terror
fillery
was
glad
he
was
satisfied
at
any
rate
the
transient
unreal
personality
called
levallon
had
disappeared
and
as
he
believed
for
ever
a
surface
apparition
after
all
it
had
been
educated
superimposed
the
result
of
imitation
and
quick
learning
a
phantom
masquerading
as
an
intelligent
human
being
it
was
merely
an
acquired
a
physical
almost
an
automatic
intelligence
the
deep
nature
underneath
had
now
broken
out
it
was
the
sudden
irruption
of
that
touched
the
subconscious
self
of
everyone
in
the
room
with
its
strange
authentic
shock
was
in
full
possession
towards
this
real
self
he
felt
attraction
yearning
even
love
he
had
felt
this
from
the
very
beginning
why
or
what
it
was
he
did
not
pretend
to
know
as
yet
towards
he
reacted
as
towards
his
own
son
as
to
a
comrade
ancient
friend
proved
intimate
and
natural
playmate
even
the
strange
tie
was
difficult
to
describe
in
himself
though
faint
by
comparison
lay
something
akin
in
sympathy
and
understanding
they
belonged
together
in
the
same
unknown
region
the
girl
of
course
belonged
there
too
but
more
completely
more
absolutely
even
than
himself
he
foresaw
the
risks
the
dangers
his
heart
with
a
leap
of
joy
accepted
the
responsibilities
unlike
devonham
he
had
not
come
that
afternoon
to
scoff
his
smile
at
the
vagaries
of
what
his
assistant
called
hysterical
psychics
had
no
bitterness
no
contempt
if
their
excesses
were
pathogenic
often
he
believed
with
lombroso
that
genius
and
hysteria
draw
upon
a
common
origin
sometimes
also
that
from
among
this
unstable
material
there
emerged
on
occasions
hints
of
undeniable
value
to
the
want
of
balance
was
chiefly
due
the
ineffectiveness
of
these
hints
this
class
dissatisfied
with
present
things
kicking
over
the
traces
which
herd
together
the
dull
normal
crowd
into
the
safe
but
uninteresting
commonplace
but
kicking
of
course
too
wildly
alone
offered
hints
of
powers
that
might
one
day
obedient
to
laws
at
present
unknown
become
of
value
to
the
race
they
were
temperamentally
open
to
occasional
if
misguided
inspiration
and
all
inspiration
the
evidence
overwhelmingly
showed
is
due
to
an
intense
but
hidden
mental
activity
the
hidden
of
the
self
peeped
out
here
and
there
periodically
these
people
were
at
heart
alert
to
new
ideas
the
herd
instinct
was
weak
in
them
they
were
individuals
fillery
had
not
come
to
scoff
his
chief
purpose
on
this
particular
occasion
had
been
to
observe
any
reactions
produced
in
levallon
by
the
atmosphere
of
these
unbalanced
yet
questing
minds
and
by
the
introduction
to
a
girl
whose
beauty
physical
and
moral
he
considered
far
far
above
the
standard
of
other
women
iraida
khilkoff
as
he
saw
her
rose
head
and
shoulders
like
some
magical
flower
in
a
beyond
her
feminine
kind
his
hopes
had
in
both
respects
proved
justified
levallon
was
gone
had
swept
up
commandingly
into
full
possession
if
it
is
the
attitude
of
mind
that
interprets
details
in
a
given
scene
it
is
the
heart
that
determines
their
selection
devonham
saw
collective
hallucination
delusion
humbug
useless
and
undesirable
weeds
where
his
chief
saw
strange
imperfect
growths
that
might
one
day
become
flowers
in
a
marvellous
garden
that
this
garden
blossomed
upon
the
sunny
slopes
of
a
lost
caucasian
valley
had
a
significance
he
did
not
shirk
always
he
was
honest
with
himself
it
was
this
symbolic
valley
he
longed
to
people
its
radiant
loveliness
stirred
a
forgotten
music
in
his
heart
he
watched
golden
bees
sipping
that
wild
azalea
honey
of
which
even
the
natives
may
not
rob
them
without
the
dangerous
delight
of
exaltation
his
nostrils
caught
the
delicious
perfumes
his
cheek
felt
the
touch
of
happy
winds
as
he
stood
by
the
door
with
devonham
and
levallon
looking
round
the
crowded
chelsea
studio
aware
of
this
association
stirring
in
his
blood
he
believed
he
had
himself
well
in
hand
he
knew
already
in
advance
that
a
spirit
moved
upon
the
face
of
those
waters
that
were
his
inmost
self
he
had
that
intuitive
divination
which
anticipates
a
change
of
spiritual
weather
the
wind
was
rising
the
atmosphere
lay
prepared
already
the
flowers
bent
their
heads
one
way
all
his
powers
of
might
well
be
called
upon
before
the
entertainment
ended
glancing
a
moment
at
levallon
tall
erect
and
poised
beside
him
he
was
conscious
it
was
an
instant
of
vivid
that
he
steadied
himself
in
doing
so
he
borrowed
as
it
were
something
of
that
poise
that
calm
simplicity
that
potential
energy
that
modest
confidence
some
latent
power
breathed
through
the
great
stalwart
figure
by
his
side
the
strength
was
not
his
own
levallon
emanated
this
power
unconsciously
khilkoff
as
described
had
then
led
the
youth
away
to
see
the
sculpture
devonham
was
captured
by
a
member
and
fillery
found
himself
alone
he
looked
about
him
noticing
here
and
there
individuals
whom
he
knew
lady
gleeson
he
saw
at
once
on
her
divan
in
the
corner
with
her
cigarette
her
jewels
her
glass
her
background
of
millions
through
which
an
indulgent
husband
floated
like
a
shadow
his
eye
rested
on
her
a
second
only
then
passed
in
search
of
something
less
insignificant
miss
lance
who
had
heard
of
his
books
and
dared
to
pretend
knowledge
of
them
monopolised
him
for
ten
minutes
a
little
tactful
kindness
managed
her
easily
while
he
watched
the
door
where
levallon
had
disappeared
with
khilkoff
and
through
which
nayan
might
any
moment
now
enter
already
his
thoughts
framed
these
two
together
in
a
picture
his
heart
saw
them
playing
hand
in
hand
among
the
flowers
of
the
hidden
valley
one
flying
the
other
following
a
radiance
of
sunny
fire
and
a
speed
of
lifting
winds
about
them
both
yet
he
himself
oddly
enough
not
far
away
he
too
was
somehow
with
them
while
listening
with
his
mind
to
what
miss
lance
was
saying
his
heart
went
out
playing
with
this
splendid
pair
he
would
not
lose
her
finally
it
seemed
some
subtle
kinship
held
them
together
in
this
trinity
the
heart
in
him
played
wild
against
the
mind
he
caught
devonham
eye
upon
him
and
a
sudden
smile
that
miss
lance
fortunately
appropriated
to
herself
ran
over
his
too
thoughtful
face
for
devonham
attitude
towards
the
case
his
original
notes
his
obvious
concealment
of
experiences
in
the
jura
mountains
flashed
across
him
with
a
flavour
of
something
half
comic
half
pathetic
with
all
that
knowledge
with
all
the
accumulation
of
data
paul
stops
short
of
wonder
he
thought
to
himself
his
eyes
fixed
solemnly
upon
miss
lance
face
he
remembered
coleridge
all
knowledge
begins
and
ends
with
wonder
but
the
first
wonder
is
the
child
of
ignorance
while
the
second
wonder
is
the
parent
of
adoration
a
thousand
years
and
the
dear
fellow
will
still
regard
adoration
as
hysteria
he
chuckled
audibly
to
his
companion
surprise
since
the
moment
was
not
appropriate
for
chuckling
making
his
peace
with
his
neighbour
he
presently
left
her
for
a
position
nearer
to
the
door
father
collins
providing
the
opportunity
father
collins
as
he
was
called
half
affectionately
half
in
awe
as
of
a
parent
with
a
cane
was
an
individual
he
had
been
evangelical
high
church
anglican
roman
catholic
in
turn
and
finally
buddhist
believing
in
reincarnation
he
did
not
look
for
progress
in
humanity
the
planet
resembled
a
form
at
school
individuals
passed
into
it
and
out
of
it
but
the
average
of
the
form
remained
the
same
the
fifth
form
was
always
the
fifth
form
earth
history
showed
no
advance
as
a
whole
though
individuals
did
he
looked
forward
therefore
to
no
utopia
nor
shared
the
pessimism
of
the
thinkers
who
despaired
of
progress
a
man
of
intense
convictions
yet
open
mind
he
was
not
ashamed
to
move
before
the
buddhist
phase
he
had
been
icily
agnostic
he
thought
but
also
he
felt
he
had
vision
and
intuition
he
had
investigated
for
himself
his
mind
was
of
the
order
buddhism
his
latest
phase
attracted
him
because
it
was
a
scientific
logical
system
rather
than
a
religion
based
on
revelation
he
belonged
eminently
to
the
unstable
he
found
no
resting
place
he
came
to
the
meetings
of
the
society
to
listen
rather
than
to
talk
his
net
was
far
flung
catching
anything
and
everything
in
the
way
of
new
ideas
experiments
theories
beliefs
especially
powers
he
tested
for
himself
then
accepted
or
discarded
the
more
extravagant
the
theory
the
greater
its
appeal
to
him
behind
a
grim
even
a
repulsive
ugliness
he
hid
a
heart
of
milk
and
honey
in
his
face
was
nobility
yet
something
slovenly
ran
through
it
like
a
streak
he
loved
his
kind
and
longed
to
help
them
to
the
light
although
a
rolling
stone
spiritually
his
naked
sincerity
won
respect
he
was
composed
however
of
several
personalities
and
hence
since
these
often
clashed
he
was
accused
of
insincerity
too
the
essay
that
lost
him
his
pulpit
and
parish
the
truth
or
proof
impossible
was
the
poignant
confession
of
an
honest
intellect
where
faith
and
unbelief
came
face
to
face
with
facts
the
bishop
naturally
preferred
the
room
of
father
collins
to
his
company
i
should
like
you
to
meet
my
friend
fillery
mentioned
after
some
preliminary
talk
he
would
interest
you
you
might
help
him
possibly
he
mentioned
a
few
essential
details
perhaps
you
will
call
one
day
you
know
my
address
and
make
his
acquaintance
his
mind
owing
to
his
lonely
and
isolated
youth
is
for
the
same
reason
a
primitive
nature
is
his
deity
father
collins
raised
his
bushy
dark
eyebrows
i
took
note
of
him
the
moment
he
came
in
he
replied
i
was
wondering
who
he
was
and
what
i
come
one
day
with
pleasure
the
innocence
on
his
face
surprised
me
is
he
may
i
ask
it
friend
or
patient
both
i
see
said
the
other
without
hesitation
he
added
you
are
experimenting
studying
i
should
value
the
help
the
view
of
a
religious
temperament
father
collins
looked
grim
to
ugliness
the
touch
of
nobility
appeared
i
know
your
ideals
fillery
i
know
your
work
he
said
gruffly
in
you
lies
more
true
religion
than
in
a
thousand
bishops
i
should
trust
your
treatment
of
an
unusual
case
if
he
added
slowly
i
can
help
him
so
much
the
better
he
then
looked
up
suddenly
his
manner
as
if
galvanized
unless
can
perhaps
help
us
the
words
struck
fillery
on
the
raw
as
it
were
they
startled
him
he
stared
into
the
other
eyes
what
makes
you
think
that
what
do
you
mean
exactly
father
collins
returned
his
gaze
unflinchingly
he
made
an
odd
reply
your
friend
he
said
looks
to
me
like
a
man
who
might
start
a
new
religion
nature
for
instance
back
to
nature
being
in
my
opinion
always
a
possible
solution
of
and
its
degeneracy
the
streak
of
something
slovenly
crept
into
the
nobility
smudging
it
so
to
speak
with
a
blur
fillery
for
a
moment
waited
listening
with
his
heart
and
find
a
million
followers
at
once
continued
the
other
as
though
he
had
not
noticed
his
voice
his
manner
his
stature
his
face
but
above
all
something
he
brings
with
him
whatever
his
nature
he
a
natural
leader
and
a
sincere
unselfish
leader
is
what
people
are
asking
for
nowadays
his
black
bushy
eyebrows
dropped
darkening
the
grim
face
you
noticed
of
course
the
women
eyes
he
mentioned
it
is
you
know
so
much
what
a
man
says
nor
entirely
his
looks
that
excite
favour
or
disfavour
with
women
it
something
he
emanates
unconsciously
they
ca
analyze
it
but
they
never
fail
to
recognize
it
fillery
moved
sideways
a
little
so
that
he
could
watch
the
inner
studio
better
the
discernment
of
his
companion
was
somewhat
unexpected
it
disconcerted
him
all
his
knowledge
all
his
experience
clustered
about
his
mind
as
thick
as
bees
yet
he
felt
unable
to
select
the
item
he
needed
the
sunshine
upon
his
inner
valley
burned
a
brighter
fire
he
saw
the
flowers
glow
the
wind
ran
sweet
and
magical
he
began
to
watch
himself
more
closely
levallon
is
an
interesting
being
he
admitted
finally
but
you
make
big
deductions
surely
a
mind
like
yours
he
added
must
have
its
reasons
power
replied
the
other
promptly
power
earlier
generations
said
emerson
god
face
to
face
through
their
eyes
why
should
not
we
also
enjoy
an
original
relation
to
nature
your
friend
has
this
original
relation
i
feel
he
stands
close
terribly
close
to
nature
he
brings
open
spaces
even
into
this
bargain
sale
he
drew
a
deep
breath
there
is
a
power
about
him
perhaps
interrupted
the
other
not
of
this
earth
you
mean
that
literally
not
of
this
earth
quite
not
of
humanity
so
to
speak
repeated
father
collins
half
irritably
as
though
his
intelligence
had
been
insulted
that
the
best
way
i
can
describe
how
it
strikes
me
ask
one
of
the
women
ask
nayan
for
instance
whatever
he
is
your
friend
is
elemental
like
a
shock
of
fire
the
unusual
words
ran
deep
into
fillery
heart
but
at
that
same
instant
a
stirring
of
the
figures
beyond
the
door
caught
his
attention
his
main
interest
revived
the
inner
door
of
the
private
studio
he
thought
had
opened
elemental
he
repeated
his
interest
torn
in
two
directions
simultaneously
he
looked
at
his
companion
keenly
searchingly
you
a
man
like
you
does
not
use
such
words
he
kept
an
eye
upon
the
inner
studio
without
meaning
the
other
caught
him
up
at
once
no
i
mean
it
nor
do
i
use
such
words
idly
to
a
man
fillery
like
you
he
stopped
he
has
what
you
have
came
the
quick
blunt
statement
only
in
your
case
it
indirect
while
in
his
it
direct
essential
they
looked
at
each
other
two
minds
packed
with
knowledge
and
softened
with
experience
of
their
kind
though
from
different
points
of
view
met
each
other
fairly
a
bridge
existed
it
was
crossed
few
words
were
necessary
it
seemed
each
understood
the
other
elemental
repeated
fillery
his
pulse
quickening
half
painfully
at
which
instant
he
knew
the
inner
door
opened
nayan
had
come
in
the
same
instant
almost
she
had
gone
out
again
so
quick
indeed
was
the
interval
between
her
appearance
and
disappearance
that
fillery
version
of
what
he
then
witnessed
in
those
few
seconds
might
have
been
ascribed
by
a
third
person
who
saw
it
with
him
to
his
imagination
largely
imaginative
at
any
rate
the
version
was
whether
it
was
on
that
account
unreal
is
another
matter
the
swift
tiny
scene
however
no
one
witnessed
but
himself
even
devonham
unusually
alert
with
professional
anxiety
missed
it
as
did
also
the
watchful
lady
gleeson
whom
jealousy
made
clairvoyante
almost
khilkoff
and
levallon
standing
sideways
to
the
door
were
equally
unaware
that
it
had
opened
then
quickly
closed
again
none
saw
apparently
the
radiant
lovely
outline
it
was
a
curtained
door
leading
out
of
the
far
end
of
the
inner
studio
into
a
passage
which
had
an
exit
to
the
street
fillery
was
so
placed
that
he
could
see
it
over
his
companion
shoulder
khilkoff
levallon
and
the
little
group
about
them
stood
in
his
direct
line
of
sight
against
the
dark
background
of
the
curtain
the
light
in
this
far
corner
was
so
dim
that
fillery
was
not
aware
the
curtained
door
had
swung
open
until
he
actually
saw
the
figure
of
nayan
khilkoff
framed
suddenly
in
the
clear
space
the
white
passage
wall
behind
her
she
wore
gloves
hat
and
furs
having
come
evidently
straight
from
the
street
ten
seconds
perhaps
twenty
she
stood
there
gazing
with
a
sudden
fixed
intensity
at
levallon
whose
figure
almost
close
enough
for
touch
was
sideways
to
her
the
face
in
profile
she
stopped
abruptly
as
though
a
shock
ran
through
her
she
remained
motionless
she
stared
an
expression
in
her
eyes
as
of
life
momentarily
arrested
by
wild
glorious
intense
surprise
the
lips
were
parted
one
gloved
hand
still
held
the
swinging
curtained
door
to
fillery
it
seemed
as
if
a
flame
leaped
into
her
eyes
the
entire
face
lit
up
she
seemed
spellbound
with
delight
this
leap
of
light
was
the
first
sign
he
witnessed
the
same
second
her
eyes
lifted
a
fraction
of
an
inch
changed
their
focus
and
gazing
past
levallon
looked
straight
across
the
room
into
his
own
in
his
mind
at
that
instant
still
rang
the
singular
words
of
father
collins
in
his
heart
still
hung
the
picture
of
the
flowered
valley
it
was
across
this
atmosphere
the
eyes
of
the
girl
flashed
their
message
like
a
stroke
of
lightning
it
came
as
a
cry
almost
a
call
for
help
an
audible
message
whose
syllables
fled
down
the
valley
yearning
sweet
yet
a
tone
of
poignant
farewell
within
the
following
wind
it
was
a
moment
of
delicious
joy
of
exquisite
pain
of
a
blissful
searching
dream
beyond
this
world
he
stood
spellbound
himself
a
moment
the
look
in
the
girl
big
eloquent
eyes
threatened
a
cherished
dream
that
lay
too
close
to
his
own
life
he
was
aware
of
collapse
of
ruin
that
old
peculiar
anguish
seized
him
he
remembered
her
words
in
baker
street
a
few
days
before
please
bring
your
friend
the
accompanying
pain
they
caused
and
now
he
caught
the
echo
on
that
following
wind
along
the
distant
valley
the
cry
in
her
eyes
came
to
him
why
o
why
do
you
bring
this
to
me
it
must
take
your
place
it
must
put
out
you
the
reasoning
and
the
inspirational
self
in
him
knew
this
momentary
confusion
as
the
cry
fled
down
the
wind
o
follow
follow
through
the
caverns
hollow
as
the
song
floats
thou
pursue
where
the
wild
bee
never
flew
the
curtained
door
swung
to
again
the
face
and
figure
were
no
longer
there
nayan
had
withdrawn
quickly
noticed
by
none
but
himself
she
had
gone
up
to
make
herself
ready
for
her
father
guests
in
a
few
minutes
she
would
come
down
again
to
play
hostess
as
her
custom
was
it
was
so
ordinary
it
was
so
dislocating
for
at
that
moment
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
feminine
forces
of
the
universe
whatever
these
may
be
focused
in
her
and
poured
against
him
their
concentrated
stream
to
allure
enchant
subdue
he
trembled
he
remembered
devonham
admission
of
the
panic
sense
it
the
air
said
a
voice
beside
him
all
this
tobacco
smoke
and
scent
and
no
ventilation
father
collins
was
speaking
only
he
had
completely
forgotten
that
father
collins
was
in
the
world
the
steadying
hand
upon
his
arm
made
him
realize
that
he
had
swayed
a
moment
the
perfume
chiefly
the
voice
continued
all
this
cheap
nasty
stuff
these
women
use
it
enough
to
sicken
any
healthy
man
nobody
knows
his
own
smell
they
say
he
laughed
a
little
collins
was
tactful
he
talked
on
easily
of
nothing
in
particular
so
that
his
companion
might
let
the
occasion
slip
or
comment
on
it
as
he
wished
worse
than
incense
fillery
gave
him
the
clue
perhaps
intentionally
certainly
with
gratitude
he
made
an
effort
he
found
control
it
intoxicates
the
imagination
does
it
that
note
of
sweet
farewell
still
hung
with
enchanting
sadness
in
his
brain
he
still
saw
those
yearning
eyes
he
heard
that
cry
and
yet
the
conflict
in
his
nature
bewildered
him
as
though
he
found
two
persons
in
him
one
weeping
while
the
other
sang
father
collins
smiled
and
fillery
then
knew
that
he
too
had
seen
the
girl
framed
in
the
doorway
intercepted
the
glance
as
well
no
shadow
of
resentment
crossed
his
heart
as
he
heard
him
add
she
too
perhaps
belongs
elsewhere
the
phrase
however
brought
to
his
own
personal
dream
the
conviction
of
another
understanding
mind
as
you
yourself
do
too
was
added
in
a
thrilling
whisper
suddenly
fillery
turned
with
a
start
to
meet
his
eye
but
that
is
problem
said
father
collins
promptly
you
are
the
expert
even
though
you
think
mistakenly
that
your
heart
is
robbed
his
voice
held
the
sympathy
and
tenderness
of
a
woman
taught
by
suffering
the
nobility
was
in
his
face
again
untarnished
now
his
words
his
tone
his
manner
caught
fillery
in
amazement
it
did
not
surprise
him
that
father
collins
had
been
quick
enough
to
understand
but
it
did
surprise
him
that
a
man
so
entangled
in
one
formal
creed
after
another
so
netted
by
the
conventional
thought
of
various
religious
systems
and
therefore
stuffed
with
old
rigid
commonplace
ideas
it
did
indeed
surprise
him
to
feel
this
sudden
atmosphere
of
vision
and
prophecy
that
abruptly
shone
about
him
the
extravagant
fantastic
side
of
the
man
he
had
forgotten
where
he
repeated
gazing
at
him
where
indeed
where
the
wild
bee
never
flew
perhaps
father
collins
eyebrows
shot
up
as
though
worked
by
artificial
springs
his
eyes
changing
extraordinarily
turned
very
keen
he
seemed
several
persons
at
once
he
looked
like
contradictory
description
a
spiritual
jesuit
the
ugly
mouth
thank
heaven
thought
fillery
showed
lines
of
hidden
humour
his
sanity
at
any
rate
was
unquestioned
father
collins
watched
the
planet
with
his
soul
not
with
his
brain
alone
but
which
of
his
many
personalities
was
now
in
the
ascendancy
no
man
least
of
all
himself
could
tell
his
companion
the
expert
in
him
automatically
aware
of
the
simultaneous
irruption
and
disruption
waited
almost
professionally
for
any
outburst
that
might
follow
arcades
ambo
he
reflected
making
a
stern
attempt
to
keep
his
balance
the
subconscious
remember
does
explain
everything
came
the
words
not
everything
he
added
with
emphasis
as
with
heredity
he
looked
keenly
half
humorously
half
sympathetically
at
the
doctor
there
are
gaps
and
lapses
the
recent
upheaval
has
been
more
than
an
war
it
was
a
planetary
event
it
has
shaken
our
nature
fundamentally
radically
the
human
mind
has
been
shocked
broken
dislocated
the
prevalent
hysteria
is
not
an
ordinary
hysteria
nor
are
the
new
powers
perhaps
quite
ordinary
either
mental
history
repeats
itself
fillery
put
in
now
more
master
of
himself
again
unbalance
has
always
followed
upheaval
the
removal
of
known
familiar
foundations
always
lets
in
extravagance
of
wildest
dissatisfaction
search
and
question
upheaval
of
this
kind
rejoined
the
other
gravely
there
has
never
been
since
human
beings
walked
the
earth
our
fabulous
old
world
trembles
in
the
balance
and
as
he
said
it
the
dreamer
shone
in
the
light
below
the
big
black
eyebrows
noticed
quickly
by
his
companion
old
ideals
have
been
smashed
beyond
recovery
the
gods
men
knew
have
been
killed
like
tommy
in
the
trenches
the
past
is
likewise
dead
its
dreams
of
progress
buried
with
it
by
a
black
maria
the
human
mind
and
heart
stand
everywhere
empty
and
bereft
while
their
hungry
and
unanswered
questions
search
the
stars
for
something
new
well
well
said
fillery
gently
half
stirred
half
amused
by
the
odd
language
you
may
be
right
but
mental
history
has
always
shown
a
desire
for
something
new
after
each
separate
collapse
signs
and
wonders
are
a
recurrent
hunger
remember
in
the
days
of
abraham
of
paul
of
moses
it
was
the
same
questions
replied
the
other
are
based
on
an
immense
accumulated
knowledge
unknown
to
moses
or
to
abraham
time
the
phenomenon
i
grant
you
is
the
same
but
the
shock
the
dislocation
the
shattering
upheaval
comes
in
the
twentieth
century
upon
minds
grounded
in
deep
scientific
wisdom
it
was
formerly
a
shock
to
the
superstitious
ignorance
of
intuitive
feeling
merely
it
is
organized
scientific
knowledge
that
meets
the
earthquake
you
mentioned
gaps
and
lapses
said
fillery
deeply
interested
but
still
half
professionally
perhaps
in
spite
of
his
preoccupations
you
think
perhaps
those
gaps
one
eye
watched
the
inner
studio
the
unstable
in
him
gained
more
and
more
the
upper
hand
i
mean
replied
father
collins
now
fairly
launched
upon
his
secret
hobby
evidently
his
qualification
for
membership
in
the
society
i
mean
edward
fillery
that
the
time
is
ripe
if
ever
for
a
new
revelation
if
man
is
the
only
type
of
being
in
the
universe
well
and
good
we
see
his
finish
plainly
for
the
war
has
shown
that
progress
is
a
myth
man
remains
in
spite
of
all
conceivable
scientific
knowledge
a
savage
of
low
degree
irredeemable
and
intellect
as
a
reconstructive
force
but
of
small
account
it
seems
so
i
admit
but
if
father
collins
said
it
as
calmly
as
though
he
spoke
of
some
new
food
or
hygienic
treatment
merely
if
mankind
is
not
the
only
life
in
the
universe
if
for
instance
there
exist
and
why
not
other
evolutionary
systems
besides
our
own
somewhat
trumpery
type
other
schemes
and
other
beings
perhaps
parallel
perhaps
quite
different
perhaps
in
more
direct
contact
with
the
sources
of
life
a
purer
emanation
so
to
say
he
hesitated
realizing
perhaps
that
in
speaking
to
a
man
of
edward
fillery
standing
he
must
choose
his
words
or
at
least
present
his
case
convincingly
while
aware
that
his
inability
to
do
so
made
him
only
more
extravagant
and
incoherent
yes
quite
so
fillery
helped
him
noting
all
the
time
the
suppressed
intensity
the
conviction
of
an
behind
the
calmness
while
the
balance
of
his
own
attention
remained
concentrated
on
the
group
about
levallon
if
as
you
suggest
there
other
types
of
life
he
spoke
encouragingly
he
had
noticed
the
slovenly
streak
spread
and
widen
breaking
down
as
it
were
the
structure
of
the
face
he
was
aware
also
of
the
increasing
insecurity
in
himself
now
is
the
moment
cried
the
other
now
is
the
time
for
their
appearance
he
turned
as
though
he
had
hit
a
target
unexpectedly
now
he
repeated
is
the
opportunity
for
their
manifestation
the
human
mind
lies
open
everywhere
it
is
blank
receptive
ready
on
all
sides
it
waits
ready
and
inviting
the
gaps
are
provided
if
there
is
any
other
life
it
should
break
through
and
come
among
us
fillery
startled
withdrew
for
the
first
time
his
attention
from
that
inner
room
with
keen
eyes
he
gazed
at
his
companion
with
an
abrupt
unpleasant
shock
it
occurred
to
him
that
all
he
heard
was
borrowed
filched
stolen
out
of
his
own
mind
before
words
came
to
him
the
other
spoke
your
friend
he
mentioned
quietly
but
with
intentional
significance
and
patient
levallon
but
it
was
at
this
moment
that
nayan
khilkoff
entering
again
without
her
hat
and
furs
had
moved
straight
to
the
piano
seated
herself
and
began
to
sing
chapter
xv
to
retail
the
following
scene
as
fillery
saw
it
in
detail
is
not
necessary
the
sequence
of
acts
of
physical
events
being
already
known
the
reactions
of
his
heart
and
mind
however
have
importance
what
he
felt
thought
hoped
and
feared
what
he
believed
as
well
his
point
of
view
in
a
word
remain
essential
edward
fillery
being
what
he
was
witnessed
it
from
his
own
individual
angle
his
mind
with
his
heredity
his
soul
with
its
mysterious
background
these
held
the
glasses
to
his
eyes
adjusting
as
with
a
zeiss
instrument
each
eye
separately
in
his
case
the
analyst
and
thinker
checked
the
unstable
dreamer
with
acute
exactitude
this
was
his
special
gift
he
studied
himself
best
while
studying
others
his
sight
moreover
was
exceptionally
keen
his
glasses
of
consummate
workmanship
he
saw
it
seems
considerably
beyond
the
normal
range
he
believed
at
least
that
he
did
so
he
saw
for
instance
that
the
girl
while
her
fingers
ran
over
the
keys
before
she
sang
searched
the
room
and
found
levallon
in
a
second
following
her
rapid
glance
he
took
in
the
picture
that
she
also
saw
levallon
coffee
cup
in
hand
before
lady
gleeson
languishing
on
the
divan
and
devonham
just
beside
them
levallon
was
obviously
unaware
of
lady
gleeson
presence
he
had
forgotten
her
existence
devonham
a
with
nothing
particular
to
do
at
the
moment
looked
uncomfortable
and
ill
at
ease
scared
a
little
fearing
a
scene
a
possible
outbreak
even
the
meaning
of
the
group
was
easily
read
the
girl
herself
undoubtedly
read
it
clearly
too
this
flashed
upon
the
cinema
screen
and
fillery
divined
it
without
the
help
of
tedious
letterpress
the
same
instant
he
was
aware
that
the
girl
and
levallon
looked
for
the
first
time
straight
into
each
other
faces
and
that
both
seemed
simultaneously
caught
into
the
air
as
though
a
star
had
lifted
them
not
even
a
question
lay
in
their
clear
eyes
it
was
an
instantaneous
understanding
so
complete
and
perfect
that
the
expression
of
happy
surprise
was
too
convincing
to
be
missed
even
by
the
lady
gleeson
vanity
usually
delays
intelligence
and
her
vanity
was
abnormal
but
she
saw
the
expression
on
the
two
faces
and
interpreted
it
aright
fillery
noticed
that
she
squirmed
she
would
presently
he
felt
positive
disappear
before
the
singing
ended
he
had
seen
her
slink
away
the
song
began
he
had
heard
it
before
the
vagrant
epitaph
sung
by
the
same
clear
sweet
voice
had
felt
his
heart
stirred
by
the
true
simple
feeling
she
put
into
it
he
knew
every
word
and
every
bar
the
music
was
her
own
he
loved
it
both
words
and
music
awoke
in
him
invariably
a
picture
of
his
own
lost
valley
a
physical
desire
to
be
over
the
hills
and
far
away
with
the
homeless
liberty
of
winds
and
stars
and
waters
and
at
the
same
time
its
spiritual
equivalent
a
yearning
that
the
race
should
discover
the
immense
fair
region
of
its
greater
hidden
self
and
enjoy
its
new
powers
without
restraint
all
this
was
familiar
to
him
but
now
as
she
sang
there
came
another
deeper
meaning
that
sublimated
the
essential
spirit
of
it
lifting
it
out
of
the
known
ditch
of
space
and
time
never
yet
had
he
heard
such
yearning
passion
such
untold
desire
in
her
voice
the
physical
vagrancy
changed
subtly
exquisitely
to
a
symbol
of
a
vaster
meaning
a
spiritual
vagrancy
that
suddenly
captured
him
in
bitter
pain
love
could
not
hold
him
duty
forged
no
chain
as
he
listened
to
the
sweetness
struck
him
between
the
joints
of
armour
he
had
not
realized
before
was
so
insecurely
bound
about
him
the
anguish
of
lonely
souls
alien
among
their
kind
hungry
for
companionship
they
might
not
find
unclothed
uncared
for
desired
of
none
and
understanding
none
this
rose
tumultuously
in
his
blood
the
wide
seas
and
the
mountains
called
him
the
words
and
music
pierced
him
like
a
flame
revel
might
hold
him
for
a
little
space
her
voice
made
it
sound
like
a
description
of
man
brief
moment
on
the
whirling
planet
tasting
adventure
with
men
and
women
playing
a
moment
with
love
and
hope
and
fear
till
turning
past
the
laughter
and
the
lamps
he
heard
that
other
summons
at
the
door
this
bigger
version
this
deeper
meaning
caught
at
him
with
power
as
he
heard
the
song
in
the
sweet
familiar
voice
and
realized
in
a
flash
that
what
he
felt
faintly
levallon
felt
terrifically
his
own
detachment
was
a
pose
a
shadow
at
best
a
bodiless
yearning
in
levallon
it
was
a
reality
of
consuming
fire
also
it
was
an
explanation
of
the
girl
own
singular
aloofness
from
the
world
of
admiring
men
both
belonged
as
father
collins
put
it
elsewhere
he
watched
them
levallon
eyes
he
saw
remained
fixed
and
motionless
on
the
singer
her
own
did
not
leave
the
notes
for
a
single
moment
the
words
and
music
poured
into
the
room
like
a
shower
of
dancing
silver
the
personality
of
the
girl
flowed
out
with
them
to
meet
the
companion
they
addressed
an
extraordinary
thing
then
happened
to
fillery
it
almost
seemed
that
there
formed
then
and
there
between
them
a
new
vehicle
as
it
were
a
body
that
gave
expression
to
their
own
great
secret
something
in
each
of
them
unable
to
manifest
through
their
minds
their
brains
their
earthly
bodies
formed
for
itself
an
elastic
subtle
vehicle
using
the
sound
the
words
the
feeling
for
this
purpose
and
as
literally
as
a
human
spirit
uses
the
familiar
physical
body
for
its
manifestation
the
experience
was
amazing
but
it
was
real
he
watched
it
carefully
in
the
room
about
him
formed
on
the
waves
of
this
sweet
singing
shaped
by
feeling
that
found
normally
no
other
expression
inspired
by
emotions
yearnings
desires
alien
to
their
normal
kind
these
two
created
between
them
a
new
vehicle
or
body
that
could
and
did
express
all
this
they
heard
that
other
summons
at
the
door
and
they
were
off
yet
he
too
heard
the
summons
and
in
the
depths
of
his
being
he
answered
to
it
his
essential
weakness
wearing
the
guise
of
strength
rose
naked
these
thoughts
and
feelings
lay
unexpressed
perhaps
too
deep
actually
too
remote
from
any
experience
he
had
yet
known
to
find
actual
words
even
in
his
mind
what
did
find
expression
in
thought
at
any
rate
was
that
before
his
very
eyes
he
witnessed
the
transfiguring
change
come
over
nayan
like
some
flower
that
has
been
growing
in
the
shade
then
meets
the
flood
of
sunshine
for
the
first
time
she
knew
a
fresh
tide
of
life
sweep
over
her
entire
being
she
seemed
to
blossom
breaking
almost
into
flower
and
fruit
before
his
very
eyes
as
though
sun
and
wind
brought
her
into
a
sudden
bloom
of
exquisite
maturity
he
was
aware
of
rich
deep
purple
the
faint
gold
of
fruits
and
flowers
the
creamy
softness
of
a
rose
the
amber
of
wild
grapes
bathed
in
sparkling
dew
the
luscious
promise
of
the
spring
matured
about
her
whole
presentment
into
full
summer
glory
and
it
was
the
sun
and
wind
of
levallon
enigmatic
stimulating
presence
close
to
her
that
caused
the
miracle
the
essential
flower
of
her
life
poured
forth
to
meet
his
own
as
he
had
always
felt
it
must
levallon
was
the
mighty
wind
that
lifted
her
was
the
sun
in
whose
heat
she
basked
expanded
soared
she
experienced
a
strange
increase
of
her
natural
vitality
and
being
her
consciousness
knew
an
abrupt
intensification
the
signs
in
that
brief
moment
were
as
clear
to
fillery
divining
heart
as
though
he
read
them
in
black
printed
letters
on
a
page
of
whitest
paper
he
knew
the
cipher
and
the
code
he
watched
the
signals
flash
they
had
not
even
spoken
yet
the
relationship
was
established
beyond
doubt
he
witnessed
the
first
exchange
the
wireless
message
of
joy
and
sympathy
that
flashed
he
intercepted
through
his
extremely
rapid
mind
as
he
watched
poured
memories
reflections
judgments
in
concentrated
form
yet
calmly
steadily
though
against
a
background
of
deep
and
troubled
emotion
there
seemed
actually
a
disruption
of
his
personality
father
collins
standing
beside
him
divined
nothing
he
believed
of
his
agitation
standing
mere
figure
of
a
man
listening
to
the
music
with
attentive
pleasure
at
least
he
gave
no
outward
sign
the
song
drew
to
its
close
once
nayan
raised
her
eyes
instantly
finding
those
of
levallon
across
the
room
then
shifting
again
for
a
fleeting
second
with
a
rapidly
changing
focus
to
his
own
he
met
them
without
a
quiver
he
caught
again
her
tender
searching
question
he
sent
no
answer
back
in
his
own
heart
burned
however
a
score
of
questions
that
beat
against
his
soul
for
answers
what
was
it
that
each
had
found
thus
intuitively
within
the
other
was
it
her
maternal
instinct
only
that
was
reached
as
with
all
other
men
hitherto
was
it
at
last
the
woman
in
her
that
leaped
towards
its
own
divine
creative
sun
or
was
it
that
hidden
nameless
aspect
of
her
which
had
never
yet
found
a
vehicle
for
manifestation
among
her
own
kind
and
had
therefore
remained
hitherto
unexpressed
bodiless
the
answer
to
this
he
found
easily
enough
no
jealousy
stirred
pain
for
himself
had
been
long
ago
uprooted
yet
pain
of
a
kind
he
felt
would
levallon
injure
drag
her
down
bring
suffering
perhaps
of
an
atrocious
sort
into
her
hitherto
so
innocent
life
was
she
yet
qualified
to
withstand
the
fierce
fire
the
rushing
wind
that
the
full
force
of
his
strange
nature
must
bring
to
bear
upon
her
his
questions
went
prophesying
flying
like
swift
birds
to
such
great
distances
that
no
audible
answers
could
return
his
pain
at
any
rate
chiefly
was
for
her
he
divined
that
she
was
frightened
yet
exhilarated
before
the
unexpected
apparition
of
an
unusual
presence
accustomed
to
smaller
jets
of
admiration
from
smaller
men
this
deep
flood
overwhelmed
her
this
motionless
figure
watching
her
among
the
shadows
listening
to
her
singing
devouring
her
beauty
with
an
innocence
power
worship
she
had
never
yet
encountered
could
she
fillery
asked
himself
withstand
its
elemental
flood
and
not
be
broken
by
its
waves
for
at
the
back
of
all
his
questions
haunting
his
prophecies
filling
his
hopes
and
fears
with
substance
stood
one
outstanding
certainty
the
motionless
figure
in
the
shadows
was
not
levallon
it
was
the
thing
he
had
expected
had
now
happened
instinctively
he
turned
to
find
his
colleague
for
what
followed
fillery
of
course
was
as
unprepared
as
anyone
in
some
way
difficult
to
describe
the
whole
thing
had
a
strangely
natural
almost
an
inevitable
touch
the
exaggeration
that
others
felt
he
was
not
conscious
of
he
never
for
a
single
moment
lost
his
head
the
wonder
of
the
elemental
violence
appealed
and
stimulated
without
once
touching
the
sense
of
fear
much
less
of
panic
in
him
searching
for
devonham
familiar
figure
he
found
it
in
the
seat
that
lady
gleeson
had
vacated
shortly
before
but
the
face
turned
away
towards
the
inner
room
so
that
it
was
not
possible
to
catch
his
eye
it
was
an
attentive
critical
almost
anxious
expression
his
chief
surprised
and
while
a
faint
smile
perhaps
flitted
across
his
own
mouth
he
became
aware
that
father
collins
he
had
again
completely
forgotten
his
proximity
was
staring
with
a
curious
intentness
at
him
the
same
instant
the
song
came
to
an
end
into
the
brief
pause
of
a
second
before
the
applause
burst
forth
father
collins
voice
was
suddenly
audible
in
his
ear
levallon
gone
fillery
was
saying
to
himself
is
in
control
when
his
neighbour
words
broke
in
the
two
sentences
were
simultaneously
in
his
mind
a
man
in
own
is
the
ruler
of
his
fate
and
fillery
astonishment
was
only
equalled
by
the
fact
that
the
grim
face
was
soft
with
sympathy
and
that
in
the
eyes
shone
moisture
that
was
close
to
tears
before
he
could
reply
however
the
applause
burst
forth
making
an
uproar
against
which
no
voice
could
possibly
contend
the
subsequent
events
following
so
swiftly
made
rejoinder
equally
out
of
the
question
nor
did
he
see
father
collins
again
that
evening
these
fillery
witnessed
much
as
already
described
through
eyes
the
storm
the
panic
took
place
as
told
yet
a
detail
here
and
there
belong
to
fillery
version
for
they
were
a
part
of
his
own
being
he
had
for
instance
a
warning
that
something
was
about
to
happen
although
warning
seems
not
quite
the
faithful
word
he
saw
the
valley
for
one
fleeting
second
the
three
familiar
figures
nayan
himself
flying
through
the
bright
sunshine
before
a
wind
that
stirred
a
million
flowers
in
the
farthest
possible
background
of
his
mind
it
shone
an
instant
the
shutter
dropped
again
it
vanished
yet
enough
to
set
him
on
the
alert
into
the
air
about
him
into
his
heart
as
well
fell
an
exhilarating
and
immense
refreshment
it
rose
as
it
were
from
the
most
deeply
submerged
portion
of
his
own
hidden
being
now
stirred
even
actually
summoned
into
activity
the
shutter
meanwhile
rose
and
fell
and
rose
again
the
valley
reappeared
and
vanished
then
reappeared
again
for
the
truth
came
smashing
against
him
smashing
his
being
open
and
bursting
the
doors
of
his
carefully
instructed
carefully
guarded
nature
the
doors
flung
from
their
hinges
and
a
blinding
light
poured
in
and
flooded
the
strangest
possible
hidden
corners
he
saw
what
followed
with
an
accuracy
of
observation
impossible
to
anyone
else
with
an
intimate
sympathy
the
others
could
not
feel
because
he
himself
took
part
in
the
entire
scene
but
the
scene
for
him
was
not

with
its
tobacco
smoke
and
perfume
it
was
the
caucasian
valley
whence
his
own
blood
derived
clean
fragrant
winds
swept
past
him
across
mighty
space
the
walls
melted
into
distances
of
forest
and
mountain
peaks
the
ceiling
was
a
dome
of
stainless
blue
the
floor
ran
deep
in
flowers
a
drenching
sunshine
of
crystal
purity
bathed
the
world
it
was
across
bright
emerald
turf
that
he
saw
dance
forward
like
a
wind
of
power
cry
with
a
joyful
resonant
voice
to
the
radiant
girl
who
stood
laughing
half
hiding
yet
at
the
same
time
beckoning
that
she
should
fly
with
him
he
caught
and
lifted
her
her
hair
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
flashing
in
the
sun
like
some
marvellous
bird
in
the
act
of
taking
wing
for
before
he
had
touched
her
she
leapt
through
the
air
to
meet
his
outstretched
arms
yet
one
hand
one
silvery
arm
waved
towards
himself
towards
fillery
their
fingers
met
and
clasped
the
three
of
them
three
dancing
free
and
joyful
figures
fled
like
the
wind
across
the
enormous
mountains
but
fled
he
knew
beyond
all
question
he
saw
this
in
the
space
of
those
few
seconds
in
which
nayan
was
swung
over
the
youth
shoulders
beside
the
piano
the
two
scenes
ran
parallel
as
it
were
before
his
eyes
outer
and
inner
sight
keeping
equal
pace
together
his
balance
and
judgment
here
were
never
once
disturbed
in
the
studio
he
had
just
introduced
levallon
to
the
girl
and
the
latter
had
caught
her
up
in
the
valley
she
had
leapt
into
his
arms
and
the
three
of
them
were
off
it
was
this
inner
interpretation
keeping
always
level
pace
with
what
was
happening
outwardly
that
furnished
fillery
with
the
hint
of
an
astounding
explanation
the
figure
in
the
valley
it
flashed
to
him
was
of
course
in
all
his
natural
splendour
but
a
figure
unknown
surely
to
all
records
of
humanity
as
such
here
danced
and
sang
a
happy
radiant
being
by
whom
the
limitations
of
the
human
species
were
not
experienced
even
if
the
species
were
familiar
to
him
at
all
a
being
from
another
system
another
evolution
an
elemental
being
whose
ideal
development
mode
of
existence
were
not
those
of
men
and
women
was
not
a
human
being
a
human
soul
a
human
spirit
he
belonged
elsewhere
and
otherwise
under
the
guise
of
levallon
he
had
drifted
in
he
inhabited
levallon
frame
in
the
studio
at
this
instant
fillery
heard
him
using
the
singular
words
already
noted
and
in
the
studio
they
sounded
indeed
senseless
foolish
even
mad
it
was
he
realized
an
attempt
to
stammer
in
human
language
some
meaning
that
lay
beyond
outside
it
in
the
valley
however
and
at
the
same
moment
they
sounded
natural
and
true
the
evolutionary
system
to
which
belonged
from
which
he
had
in
some
as
yet
unknown
manner
passed
into
humanity
but
to
which
though
almost
entirely
forgotten
he
yearned
with
his
whole
being
to
return
this
other
system
had
it
seemed
its
own
conditions
its
own
methods
of
advance
its
ideals
and
its
duties
were
then
its
inhabitants
this
flashed
upon
him
in
the
delicious
wind
and
sunshine
the
workers
in
what
men
call
the
natural
kingdoms
the
builders
of
form
and
structure
the
directing
powers
that
expressed
themselves
through
the
elemental
energies
everywhere
behind
the
laws
of
nature
was
this
their
tireless
and
wondrous
service
in
the
planet
in
the
universe
itself
called
the
girl
to
service
not
to
personal
love
alone
cut
off
from
his
own
kind
alien
and
derelict
amid
the
conditions
of
a
humanity
strange
perhaps
unknown
to
him
he
sought
companionship
where
he
could
drawn
instinctively
to
the
more
impersonal
types
such
as
fillery
and
the
girl
he
felt
there
the
nearest
approach
to
what
he
recognized
as
his
own
kind
their
ideal
of
selfless
service
was
a
beacon
that
he
understood
he
would
return
to
his
own
kingdom
carrying
them
both
with
him
from
somewhere
at
any
rate
this
all
flashed
into
his
too
willing
mind
at
which
second
precisely
in
fillery
khilkoff
entered
and
yet
before
he
could
take
action
the
lightning
struck
and
the
sudden
explosion
of
the
ferocious
storm
blackened
out
both
the
outer
and
the
inner
scene
the
shock
of
elemental
violence
the
astounding
revelation
as
well
that
an
entirely
new
type
had
possibly
come
within
his
ken
this
combined
with
the
emotional
disturbance
caused
by
the
change
produced
in
nayan
seemed
enough
to
upset
the
equilibrium
of
even
the
most
balanced
mind
the
darkness
added
its
touch
of
helplessness
besides
yet
fillery
never
for
a
moment
lost
his
head
two
natures
in
him
cause
of
his
radical
instability
merged
for
a
moment
in
amazing
harmony
the
panic
now
dominating
all
about
him
seemed
so
small
a
thing
compared
to
the
shattering
discovery
life
had
just
offered
to
him
across
it
finding
his
way
past
kneeling
women
and
shrieking
girls
drenched
to
the
skin
by
the
flood
of
entering
rain
moving
over
splintered
glass
he
found
the
figure
he
sought
as
though
by
some
instinctive
sympathy
they
came
together
in
the
darkness
their
hands
met
easily
a
moment
later
they
were
in
the
street
and
instinctive
terror
amid
the
sheets
of
falling
water
an
element
hostile
to
his
own
natural
fire
made
it
a
simple
matter
to
get
him
home
in

gleeson

chapter
xvi
when
relative
order
had
been
restored
devonham
realized
of
course
that
his
colleague
had
cleverly
spirited
away
their
patient
also
that
the
sculptor
had
carried
off
his
daughter
relieved
to
escape
from
the
atmosphere
of
what
he
considered
collective
hysteria
he
had
borrowed
mackintosh
and
umbrella
and
declining
several
offers
of
a
lift
had
walked
the
four
miles
to
his
house
in
the
rain
and
wind
the
exercise
helped
to
work
off
the
emotion
in
him
his
mind
cleared
healthily
personal
bias
gave
way
to
honest
and
unprejudiced
reflection
there
was
much
that
interested
him
deeply
at
the
same
time
puzzled
and
bewildered
him
beyond
anything
he
had
yet
experienced
he
reached
the
house
with
a
mind
steady
if
unsatisfied
but
the
emotions
caused
by
prejudice
had
gone
his
main
anxiety
centred
about
his
chief
he
was
glad
to
notice
a
light
in
an
upper
window
for
it
meant
he
hoped
that
levallon
was
now
safely
home
while
his
latchkey
sought
its
hole
however
this
light
was
extinguished
and
when
the
door
opened
it
was
fillery
himself
who
greeted
him
a
finger
on
his
lips
quietly
he
whispered
i
just
got
him
to
bed
and
put
his
light
out
he
asleep
already
paul
noticed
his
manner
instantly
its
happiness
there
was
a
glow
of
mysterious
joy
and
wonder
in
his
atmosphere
that
made
the
other
hostile
at
once
they
went
together
towards
that
inner
room
where
so
often
together
they
had
already
talked
both
moon
and
sun
to
bed
cold
food
lay
on
the
table
and
while
they
satisfied
their
hunger
the
rain
outside
poured
down
with
a
steady
drenching
sound
the
wind
had
dropped
the
suburb
lay
silent
and
deserted
it
was
long
past
midnight
the
house
was
very
still
only
the
occasional
step
of
a
audible
in
the
passages
and
rooms
upstairs
they
would
not
be
disturbed
you
got
him
home
all
right
then
paul
asked
presently
keeping
his
voice
low
he
had
been
observing
his
friend
closely
the
evident
pleasure
and
satisfaction
in
the
face
annoyed
him
the
light
in
the
eyes
at
the
same
time
profoundly
troubled
him
not
only
did
he
love
his
chief
for
himself
he
set
high
value
on
his
work
as
well
it
would
be
deplorable
a
tragedy
if
judgment
were
destroyed
by
personal
bias
and
desire
he
felt
uneasy
and
distressed
fillery
nodded
then
gave
an
account
of
what
had
happened
but
obviously
an
account
of
outward
events
merely
he
did
not
wish
evidently
to
argue
or
explain
the
strong
rugged
face
was
lit
up
the
eyes
were
shining
some
inner
enthusiasm
pervaded
his
whole
being
evidently
he
felt
very
sure
of
something
something
that
both
pleased
and
stimulated
him
his
account
of
what
had
happened
was
brief
enough
little
more
than
a
statement
of
the
facts
finding
himself
close
to
levallon
when
the
darkness
came
he
had
kept
hold
of
him
and
hurried
him
out
of
the
house
at
once
the
sudden
blackness
it
seemed
had
made
levallon
quiet
again
though
he
kept
asking
excitedly
for
the
girl
when
assured
that
he
would
soon
see
her
he
became
obedient
as
a
lamb
the
absence
of
light
apparently
had
a
calming
influence
they
found
of
course
no
taxis
but
commandeered
the
first
available
private
car
fillery
using
the
authoritative
influence
of
his
name
and
it
was
lady
gleeson
car
lady
gleeson
herself
inside
it
she
had
thought
things
over
put
two
and
two
together
and
had
come
back
her
car
might
be
of
use
it
was
for
the
rain
was
falling
in
sheets
and
bucketfuls
the
road
had
become
a
river
of
water
and
fillery
automobile
ordered
for
an
hour
later
had
not
put
in
an
appearance
it
was
the
rain
that
saved
the
situation
an
exasperated
expression
crossed
devonham
face
as
he
heard
this
detail
emphasized
he
had
meant
to
listen
without
interruption
the
enigmatical
reference
to
the
rain
proved
too
much
for
him
why
rain
what
mean
exactly
edward
water
was
the
reply
made
in
a
significant
tone
that
further
annoyed
his
listener
sense
of
judgment
you
remember
the
channel
surely
water
and
fire
mutually
destroy
each
other
they
are
hostile
elements
there
was
a
look
almost
of
amusement
on
his
face
as
he
said
it
devonham
kept
a
tight
hold
upon
his
tongue
it
was
not
impatience
or
surprise
he
felt
though
both
were
strong
it
was
perhaps
sorrow
and
so
lady
gleeson
drove
you
home
he
waited
with
devouring
interest
for
further
details
the
throng
of
questions
criticisms
and
emotions
surging
in
him
he
repressed
with
admirable
restraint
lady
gleeson
yes
had
driven
the
party
home
fillery
made
her
sit
on
the
back
seat
alone
while
he
occupied
the
front
one
levallon
beside
him
but
as
far
back
among
the
deep
cushions
as
possible
the
doctor
held
his
hand
at
any
other
time
devonham
could
have
laughed
but
he
saw
no
comedy
now
lady
gleeson
it
seemed
was
awed
by
the
seriousness
of
the
chief
whom
even
at
the
best
of
times
she
feared
a
little
her
vanity
however
persuaded
her
evidently
that
she
was
somehow
the
centre
of
interest
yet
devonham
as
he
listened
had
difficulty
in
persuading
himself
that
he
was
in
the
twentieth
century
and
that
the
man
who
spoke
was
his
colleague
and
a
man
of
the
day
as
well
levallon
talked
little
and
that
little
to
himself
or
to
me
he
seemed
unaware
that
a
third
person
was
present
at
all
though
quiet
enough
there
was
suppressed
vehemence
still
about
him
he
said
various
things
that
belonged
to
us
for
instance
that
he
his
own
that
was
with
fire
in
exile
and
that
he
would
her
back
also
that
i
too
must
go
with
them
both
he
often
mentioned
the
sun
saying
more
than
once
that
the
sun
had
its
messengers
obviously
it
was
not
the
ordinary
sun
he
referred
to
but
some
source
of
central
heat
and
fire
he
seems
aware
of
you
i
suppose
edward
put
in
his
listener
quickly
said
nothing
to
encourage
all
this
nothing
that
could
suggest
or
stimulate
fillery
ignored
even
if
he
noticed
the
tone
of
the
question
i
kept
silence
rather
i
said
very
little
i
let
him
talk
i
had
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
woman
too
you
certainly
had
your
hands
full
a
dual
personality
and
a
nymphomaniac
she
helped
me
without
knowing
it
all
he
said
about
the
girl
she
evidently
took
to
herself
when
he
begged
me
to
keep
the
water
out
she
drew
the
window
up
the
last
the
water
frightened
him
she
was
sympathetic
and
her
sympathy
seemed
to
reach
him
though
i
doubt
if
he
was
aware
of
her
presence
at
all
until
the
last
minute
almost
and
the
last
minute
she
leaned
forward
suddenly
and
took
both
his
hands
i
had
let
go
of
the
one
i
held
and
was
just
about
to
open
the
door
when
i
heard
her
say
excitedly
that
i
must
let
her
come
and
see
him
or
that
he
must
call
on
her
she
was
sure
she
could
help
him
he
must
tell
her
everything
i
turned
to
look
levallon
startled
into
what
i
believe
was
his
first
consciousness
of
her
presence
stared
into
her
eyes
and
leaned
forward
among
his
cushions
a
little
so
that
their
faces
were
close
together
before
i
could
interfere
she
had
flung
her
bare
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
she
then
sat
back
again
turning
to
me
and
repeating
again
and
again
that
he
needed
a
care
and
that
she
must
help
and
mother
him
she
was
excited
but
she
knew
what
she
was
saying
she
showed
neither
shame
nor
the
least
confusion
she
tasted
of
course
with
her
it
can
not
last
a
bigger
world
she
was
most
determined
reaction
inquired
devonham
amused
in
spite
of
his
graver
emotions
of
uneasiness
and
exasperation
none
whatever
i
scarcely
think
he
realized
he
had
been
kissed
his
interest
was
so
entirely
elsewhere
i
saw
his
face
a
moment
among
the
white
ermine
the
bare
arms
and
jewels
that
enveloped
him
fillery
frowned
faintly
the
car
had
almost
stopped
lady
gleeson
was
leaning
back
again
he
looked
at
me
and
his
voice
was
intense
and
eager
fillery
he
said
have
found
each
other
i
have
found
her
she
knows
she
remembers
the
way
back
here
we
can
do
so
little
lady
gleeson
however
had
interpreted
the
words
in
another
way
come
to
see
you
she
said
at
once
intensely
let
me
come
the
last
words
addressed
to
me
of
course
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
a
moment
in
silence
and
for
the
first
time
during
the
conversation
they
exchanged
a
smile
i
got
him
to
bed
fillery
concluded
in
ten
minutes
he
was
sound
asleep
and
his
eyes
indicated
the
room
overhead
he
leaned
back
and
quietly
began
to
fill
his
pipe
the
account
was
over
as
though
a
great
spring
suddenly
released
him
paul
devonham
stood
up
his
untidy
hair
hung
wild
his
glasses
were
crooked
on
his
big
nose
his
tie
askew
his
whole
manner
bristled
with
accumulated
challenge
and
disagreement
he
cried
edward
i
ask
you
his
colleague
yet
knowing
exactly
what
he
meant
looked
up
questioningly
he
looked
him
full
in
the
face
hush
he
said
quietly
you
wake
him
he
gazed
with
happy
penetrating
eyes
at
his
companion
paul
he
added
gently
do
you
really
mean
it
have
you
still
the
faintest
doubt
the
moment
had
drama
in
it
of
unusual
kind
the
conflict
between
these
two
honest
and
unselfish
minds
was
vital
the
moment
too
was
chosen
the
place
as
well
this
small
quiet
room
in
a
commonplace
suburb
of
the
greatest
city
on
the
planet
drenched
by
earthly
rain
and
battered
by
earthly
wind
from
the
heart
of
an
equinoctial
storm
the
mighty
universe
outside
breaking
with
wondrous
incredible
impossibilities
upon
a
mind
that
listened
and
a
mind
that
could
not
hear
and
upstairs
separated
from
them
by
a
few
carpenter
boards
an
assortment
of
souls
either
derelict
and
ruined
or
gifted
supernormally
masters
of
space
and
time
perhaps
yet
all
waiting
to
be
healed
by
the
best
knowledge
known
to
the
race
and
one
among
them
about
whom
the
conflict
raged
sound
asleep
while
wind
and
water
stormed
while
lightning
fires
lit
the
distant
horizons
while
the
great
sun
lay
hidden
and
darkness
crept
soundlessly
to
and
fro
have
you
still
the
slightest
doubt
paul
repeated
fillery
you
know
the
evidence
you
have
an
open
mind
then
devonham
still
standing
over
his
chief
let
out
the
storm
that
had
accumulated
in
him
he
talked
like
a
book
he
talked
like
several
books
it
seemed
almost
that
he
distrusted
his
own
personal
judgment
edward
he
began
solemnly
not
knowing
that
he
quoted
you
above
all
men
understand
the
lower
recesses
of
the
human
heart
that
gloomy
gigantic
oubliette
in
which
our
million
ancestors
writhe
together
inextricably
and
each
man
planetary
past
is
buried
alive
fillery
nodded
quietly
his
acquiescence
you
of
all
men
know
our
packed
limitless
subterranean
life
devonham
went
on
and
its
impenetrable
depths
you
understand
telepathy
telepathy
as
well
and
how
a
given
mind
may
tap
not
only
forgotten
individual
memories
but
memories
of
his
family
his
race
even
planetary
memories
into
the
bargain
the
memory
in
fact
of
every
being
that
ever
lived
right
down
to
adam
if
you
will
agreed
murmured
the
other
listening
patiently
while
he
puffed
his
pipe
and
heard
the
rain
and
wind
i
know
all
that
i
know
it
at
any
rate
as
a
possible
theory
you
also
know
continued
devonham
in
a
slightly
less
strident
tone
your
own
forgive
me
edward
your
own
idiosyncrasies
your
weaknesses
your
dynamic
accumulated
repressions
your
strange
physical
heritage
and
spiritual
i
repeat
the
phrase
your
spiritual
vagrancies
towards
towards
he
broke
off
suddenly
unable
to
find
the
words
he
wanted
i
illegitimate
born
of
a
pagan
passion
mentioned
the
other
calmly
in
that
sense
if
you
like
i
have
in
me
a
against
the
race
against
humanity
as
such
he
smiled
patiently
and
it
was
the
patience
the
evident
conviction
of
superiority
that
exasperated
his
cautious
accurate
colleague
if
i
love
humanity
i
also
tolerate
it
perhaps
for
i
try
to
heal
it
added
fillery
but
believe
me
paul
i
do
not
lose
my
scientific
judgment
edward
burst
out
the
other
how
can
you
think
it
possible
then
that
is
other
than
the
result
of
tendencies
transmitted
by
his
mad
parents
or
acquired
from
mason
who
taught
him
all
he
knows
or
if
you
will
that
he
has
these
hysterical
faculties
supernormal
as
we
may
call
them
which
tap
some
racial
even
if
you
will
some
planetary
past
he
again
broke
off
unable
to
express
his
whole
thought
his
entire
emotion
in
a
few
words
i
accept
all
that
said
fillery
still
calmly
quietly
but
perhaps
now
in
the
interest
of
truth
his
tone
was
grave
his
words
obviously
chosen
carefully
if
now
i
feel
it
necessary
to
go
beyond
it
my
strange
heritage
he
added
is
even
possibly
a
help
and
guide
how
he
asked
a
trace
of
passion
for
the
first
time
visible
in
his
manner
shall
we
venture
how
decide
for
we
are
not
wholly
ignorant
you
and
i
between
what
is
possible
and
impossible
is
this
trivial
planet
then
he
asked
his
voice
rising
suddenly
ominously
perhaps
our
sole
criterion
dare
we
not
venture
beyond
a
little
the
scientific
mind
should
be
the
last
to
dogmatize
as
to
the
possibilities
of
this
life
of
ours
the
authority
of
chief
the
old
tie
of
respectful
and
affectionate
friendship
the
admiring
wonder
that
pertained
to
a
daring
speculator
who
had
often
proved
himself
right
in
face
of
violent
opposition
all
these
affected
devonham
he
did
not
weaken
but
for
an
instant
he
knew
perhaps
the
existence
of
a
vast
incredible
horizon
in
his
mind
though
one
he
dared
not
contemplate
possibly
he
understood
in
this
passing
moment
a
huger
world
a
new
outlook
that
scorned
limit
though
yet
an
outlook
that
his
accurate
smaller
spirit
shrank
from
he
found
at
any
rate
his
own
words
futile
you
remember
he
offered
need
only
suppose
the
continuity
of
our
own
consciousness
with
a
mother
sea
to
allow
for
exceptional
waves
occasionally
pouring
over
the
dam
good
yes
said
fillery
but
that
sea
what
may
it
not
include
dare
we
set
limits
to
it
and
as
he
said
it
fillery
emotion
visible
in
him
rose
suddenly
from
his
chair
he
stood
up
and
faced
his
colleague
let
us
come
to
the
point
he
said
in
a
clear
steady
voice
it
all
lies
does
it
in
that
question
you
asked
came
at
once
from
devonham
lips
as
he
stood
looking
oddly
stiff
and
rigid
opposite
his
chief
there
was
a
touch
of
defiance
in
his
tone
he
repeated
his
original
question
no
pause
intervened
fillery
reply
came
sharp
and
firm
he
said
an
interval
of
silence
followed
then
between
the
two
men
as
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
fillery
waited
for
his
assistant
to
speak
but
no
word
came
levallon
the
older
man
continued
is
the
transient
acquired
personality
it
does
not
interest
us
there
is
no
real
levallon
the
sole
reality
is
he
spoke
with
the
earnestness
of
deep
conviction
there
was
still
no
reply
or
comment
from
the
other
paul
he
continued
steadying
his
voice
and
placing
a
hand
upon
his
colleague
shoulder
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
consider
our
arrangement
cancelled
i
must
then
before
he
could
finish
what
he
had
to
say
the
other
had
said
it
for
him
edward
i
give
you
back
your
promise
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
ever
so
slightly
but
there
was
no
unpleasant
no
antagonistic
touch
now
either
in
voice
or
manner
there
was
rather
a
graver
earnestness
than
there
had
been
hitherto
a
hint
of
reluctant
acquiescence
but
also
there
was
an
emotion
that
included
certainly
affection
no
such
fundamental
disagreement
had
ever
come
between
them
during
all
their
years
of
work
together
you
understand
he
added
slowly
what
you
are
doing
what
is
involved
his
tone
almost
suggested
that
he
spoke
to
a
patient
a
loved
patient
but
one
over
whom
he
had
no
control
he
sighed
i
belong
paul
myself
to
the
unstable
if
that
is
what
you
mean
said
his
old
friend
gently
and
with
all
of
danger
or
of
wonder
it
involves
the
faint
movement
of
the
shoulders
again
was
noticeable
we
need
not
put
it
that
way
edward
was
the
quiet
rejoinder
for
that
if
true
can
only
help
your
insight
your
understanding
and
your
judgment
he
hesitated
a
moment
or
two
searching
his
mind
carefully
for
words
fillery
waited
but
it
involves
i
think
he
went
on
presently
in
a
firmer
voice
fate
as
well
he
must
become
permanently
one
or
other
no
pause
followed
there
was
a
smile
of
curious
happiness
on
face
as
he
instantly
answered
in
a
tone
of
absolute
conviction
there
lies
the
root
of
our
disagreement
paul
there
is
no
i
am
positive
for
once
there
is
only
one
and
that
one
is
umph
his
friend
grunted
behind
the
exclamation
hid
an
attitude
confirmed
as
though
he
had
come
suddenly
to
a
big
decision
you
see
paul
i
chapter
xvii
it
was
not
long
after
the
scene
in
the
studio
that
the
prometheans
foregathered
at
dinner
in
the
back
room
of
the
small
french
restaurant
in
soho
and
discussed
the
event
the
prices
were
moderate
conditions
free
and
easy
it
was
a
favourite
haunt
of
members
moreover
there
was
likely
to
be
a
good
attendance
the
word
had
gone
out
the
studio
scene
had
of
course
been
the
subject
of
much
discussion
already
the
night
of
its
occurrence
it
had
been
talked
over
till
dawn
in
more
than
one
flat
and
during
the
following
days
the
society
as
a
whole
thought
of
little
else
those
who
had
not
been
present
had
to
be
informed
and
those
who
had
witnessed
it
found
it
an
absorbing
topic
of
speculation
the
first
words
that
passed
when
one
member
met
another
in
the
street
was
what
you
make
of
that
storm
was
it
amazing
did
your
solar
plexus
vibrate
mine
did
and
the
light
the
colour
the
vibrations
were
they
terrific
what
do
you
think
is
it
was
rumoured
that
the
secretary
was
asking
for
individual
reports
excitement
and
interest
were
general
though
the
accounts
of
individual
witnesses
differed
extraordinarily
it
seemed
impossible
that
all
had
seen
and
heard
the
same
thing
the
back
room
was
pleasantly
filled
for
it
was
somehow
known
that
millington
povey
and
possibly
father
collins
too
were
coming
miss
milligan
the
astrologist
was
there
early
arriving
with
towzer
who
saw
auras
and
had
already
it
was
rumoured
painted
automatically
a
strange
rendering
of
forces
that
were
visible
to
her
clairvoyantly
during
the
occurrence
miss
lance
in
shining
beads
and
a
glittering
scarf
arrived
on
their
heels
an
account
of
the
scene
in
her
pocket
to
be
published
in
her
magazine
simplicity
after
she
had
modified
it
according
to
what
she
picked
up
from
hearing
other
and
better
descriptions
kempster
immaculate
as
ever
ordering
his
food
as
he
ordered
his
clothes
like
a
connoisseur
was
one
of
the
first
to
establish
himself
in
a
comfortable
seat
he
knew
how
to
look
after
himself
and
was
already
eating
in
his
neat
dainty
way
while
the
others
still
stood
about
studying
the
big
white
with
its
illegible
hieroglyphics
in
smudged
violet
ink
he
supplemented
his
meals
with
special
patent
foods
of
vegetarian
kind
he
brought
with
him
he
had
dried
bananas
in
one
pocket
and
spirit
photographs
in
another
and
he
was
invariably
pulling
out
the
wrong
thing
meat
he
avoided
a
man
is
what
he
eats
he
held
and
animal
blood
was
fatal
to
psychic
development
to
eat
pig
or
cow
was
to
absorb
undesirable
characteristics
next
to
him
sat
lattimer
a
lanky
man
of
thirty
with
loose
clothes
long
hair
and
eyes
of
strange
intensity
known
as
occultist
and
alchemist
he
was
also
a
chemist
of
some
repute
his
life
was
ruled
by
a
and
a
the
former
that
he
might
one
day
project
his
double
consciously
the
latter
that
in
his
next
earthly
incarnation
he
might
be
the
prospect
made
him
shudder
a
woman
he
sought
to
keep
his
thought
as
concrete
as
possible
the
male
quality
he
believed
that
the
nervous
centre
of
the
physical
body
which
controlled
all
such
unearthly
if
not
definitely
spiritual
impulses
was
the
solar
plexus
for
him
it
was
important
portion
of
his
anatomy
the
seat
of
intuition
brain
came
second
the
fellow
he
declared
emphatically
stirred
my
solar
plexus
my
that
all
i
know
he
referred
as
all
understood
to
the
latent
power
the
claim
lies
coiled
but
only
rarely
manifested
in
that
great
nervous
centre
his
statement
he
knew
would
meet
with
general
approval
and
understanding
it
was
the
literal
kempster
who
spoiled
his
opening
paul
devonham
said
the
latter
thinks
it
merely
a
secondary
personality
that
emerged
i
had
a
long
argument
with
him
about
it
never
argue
with
the
declared
povey
flatly
producing
his
pet
sentence
it
waste
of
time
only
older
souls
with
the
experience
of
many
earthly
lives
stored
in
their
beings
are
knowledgeable
he
filled
his
glass
and
poured
out
for
others
lattimer
and
towzer
alone
declining
though
for
different
reasons
it
destroys
the
explained
the
former
alcohol
sets
up
coarse
vibrations
that
ruin
clairvoyance
i
decided
to
deny
myself
till
the
war
is
over
was
reason
and
when
povey
reminded
her
of
the
armistice
she
mentioned
that
turkey
had
signed
yet
i
think
his
soul
began
miss
lance
if
he
a
soul
put
in
povey
is
hardly
in
his
body
at
all
concluded
miss
lance
less
convincingly
than
originally
intended
it
was
love
at
first
sight
his
sign
is
fire
and
hers
is
air
miss
milligan
said
that
certain
they
came
together
a
clear
case
of
memory
at
any
rate
insisted
kempster
two
old
souls
meeting
again
for
the
first
time
for
thousands
of
years
probably
love
at
first
sight
or
hate
for
that
matter
is
always
memory
is
it
he
disliked
the
astrology
explanation
it
was
not
mysterious
enough
too
mathematical
and
exact
to
please
him
secondary
personalities
invariably
memories
of
former
selves
of
course
agreed
young
dickson
the
theosophist
who
was
on
the
verge
now
of
becoming
a
and
had
already
discarded
freud
for
jung
if
not
memories
of
past
lives
then
they
desires
suppressed
in
this
one
the
less
you
think
the
more
you
know
suggested
miss
lance
she
distrusted
intellect
and
believed
that
another
faculty
called
instinct
or
intuition
according
to
which
word
first
occurred
to
her
was
the
way
to
knowledge
she
was
about
to
quote
bergson
upside
down
when
povey
foreseeing
an
interval
of
boredom
took
command
one
thing
we
know
at
any
rate
he
began
judiciously
we
are
the
only
beings
in
the
universe
there
are
intelligences
both
vast
and
small
the
old
legends
ca
be
built
on
nothing
in
every
age
of
history
the
reports
are
universal
we
have
pretty
good
evidence
for
other
forms
of
life
than
humans
though
never
yet
in
human
put
in
lattimer
yet
sympathetically
their
bodies
i
mean
are
human
he
added
exactly
that
true
but
the
gods
the
fauns
the
satyrs
the
elemental
beings
as
we
call
sylphs
undines
gnomes
and
salamanders
to
say
nothing
of
fairies
et
hoc
genus
omne
there
must
be
reasonable
foundation
for
their
persistence
through
all
the
ages
they
all
belong
to
the
evolution
dickson
mentioned
with
conviction
in
the
east
it
been
known
and
recognized
for
centuries
has
it
another
evolutionary
system
that
runs
parallel
to
ours
from
planetary
spirits
down
to
elementals
they
concerned
with
the
building
up
of
form
in
the
various
kingdoms
yes
yes
povey
interrupted
impatiently
dickson
was
stealing
what
he
had
meant
to
say
himself
and
to
say
he
flattered
himself
far
better
we
know
all
of
course
they
stand
behind
what
we
call
the
laws
of
nature
activities
and
intelligences
of
every
grade
and
kind
they
work
for
humanity
in
a
way
are
in
other
space
and
time
deathless
of
course
yet
in
some
strange
way
always
eager
to
cross
the
gulf
fixed
between
the
two
and
so
find
a
soul
they
are
impersonal
in
a
sense
as
impersonal
as
say
wind
and
fire
through
which
some
of
them
operate
as
bodies
he
paused
and
looked
about
him
noting
the
interested
attention
he
awaked
there
be
times
he
went
on
there
probably
certain
occasions
when
the
gulf
is
more
crossable
than
others
he
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
as
a
sympathetic
murmur
proved
that
the
point
he
was
leading
up
to
was
favourably
understood
already
we
have
had
this
war
for
instance
he
stated
his
voice
taking
on
a
more
significant
and
mysterious
tone
dislodged
by
the
huge
upheaval
man
soul
is
on
the
march
again
he
paused
once
more
he
concluded
lowering
his
voice
still
more
and
emphasizing
the
pronoun
are
possibly
already
among
us
who
knows
he
glanced
round
we
do
we
know
was
the
expression
on
most
faces
all
knew
precisely
what
he
meant
and
to
whom
he
referred
at
any
rate
you
might
get
him
to
come
and
lecture
to
us
said
dickson
the
first
to
break
the
pause
you
might
ask
fillery
know
him
that
an
idea
began
the
secretary
when
there
was
a
commotion
near
the
door
his
face
showed
annoyance
it
was
the
arrival
of
toogood
that
at
this
moment
disturbed
the
atmosphere
and
robbed
povey
of
the
effect
he
aimed
at
it
provided
kempster
however
with
an
idea
at
the
same
time
here
a
psychometrist
he
exclaimed
making
room
for
him
he
might
get
a
bit
of
his
hair
or
clothing
and
psychometrize
it
he
might
tell
us
about
his
past
if
not
exactly
he
is
the
suggestion
however
found
no
seconder
for
it
seemed
that
the
new
arrival
was
not
particularly
welcomed
judging
by
the
glances
the
varying
shades
of
greeting
too
he
was
not
fully
trusted
perhaps
this
broad
fleshy
man
of
with
complexion
blotchy
an
mouth
and
eyes
a
trifle
shifty
his
claim
to
membership
was
he
remembered
past
lives
and
had
the
strange
power
of
psychometry
an
archæologist
by
trade
his
gift
of
psychometry
by
which
he
claimed
to
hold
an
object
and
tell
its
past
its
pedigree
its
history
was
of
great
use
to
him
in
his
calling
without
further
trouble
he
could
tell
whether
such
an
object
was
genuine
or
sham
dealers
in
antiquities
offered
him
big
fees
but
no
no
i
can
not
prostitute
my
powers
you
see
and
he
remained
poor
accordingly
in
his
past
lives
he
had
been
either
a
famous
pharaoh
or
cleopatra
according
to
his
audience
of
the
moment
and
its
male
or
female
character
but
usually
cleopatra
because
on
the
whole
there
was
more
money
and
less
risk
in
her
he
lectured
for
a
fee
lately
however
he
had
been
pharaoh
having
got
into
grave
trouble
over
the
cleopatra
claim
even
to
the
point
of
being
threatened
with
expulsion
from
the
society
his
attitude
during
the
war
besides
had
been
unsatisfactory
it
was
felt
he
had
selfishly
protected
himself
on
the
grounds
of
being
physically
unfit
apart
from
archæology
too
his
chief
preoccupation
derived
from
past
lives
of
course
was
sex
in
the
form
of
other
men
wives
his
own
wife
and
children
being
naturally
very
recent
and
somewhat
negligible
ties
his
gift
of
psychometry
none
the
less
was
considered
proved
in
spite
of
the
backward
and
indifferent
dealers
his
mind
was
quick
and
not
unsubtle
he
became
now
au
fait
with
the
trend
of
the
conversation
in
a
very
few
seconds
but
he
had
not
been
present
at
the
studio
when
the
occurrence
all
discussed
had
taken
place
hair
would
be
best
he
advised
tentatively
sipping
his
he
had
already
dined
it
a
part
of
himself
you
see
better
than
mere
clothing
i
mean
it
extremely
vital
hair
it
grows
after
death
if
i
can
get
it
for
you
i
will
said
povey
he
may
be
lecturing
for
us
before
long
i
try
with
psychometry
and
a
good
photograph
kempster
suggested
a
time
exposure
if
possible
we
ought
to
get
evidence
at
any
rate
it
evidence
we
want
of
course
is
it
what
do
you
think
of
this
for
instance
i
wonder
he
turned
to
lattimer
drawing
something
from
his
pocket
and
showing
it
it
a
time
exposure
at
night
of
a
haunted
tree
you
notice
a
queer
sort
of
elemental
form
the
trunk
and
branches
oh
he
replaced
the
shrivelled
banana
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
the
photograph
without
a
smile
this
he
explained
waving
it
is
what
i
meant
they
fell
to
discussing
it
meanwhile
povey
anxious
to
resume
his
lecture
made
an
effort
to
recover
his
command
of
the
which
toogood
had
disturbed
the
latter
had
a
personal
magnetism
which
made
the
women
like
him
in
spite
of
their
distrust
i
was
just
saying
he
resumed
patting
the
elbow
of
the
psychometrist
that
this
strange
event
we
been
discussing
you
were
present
i
believe
at
the
time
but
of
course
you
heard
about
it
has
features
which
seem
to
point
to
something
radically
new
or
at
least
of
very
rare
occurrence
as
lattimer
mentioned
a
human
body
has
never
yet
so
far
as
we
know
been
occupied
obsessed
by
a
entity
but
that
after
all
is
no
reason
why
it
should
not
ever
happen
what
is
a
body
anyhow
what
is
an
entity
too
povey
thought
was
wandering
evidently
the
thread
of
his
first
discourse
was
broken
he
floundered
man
anyway
is
more
than
a
mere
chemical
machine
he
went
on
a
crystallization
of
the
primitive
nebulæ
though
the
instrument
he
uses
the
body
he
works
through
is
undoubtedly
thus
describable
now
we
know
there
are
all
kinds
of
intelligences
busy
on
our
planet
in
the
universe
itself
as
well
why
then
i
ask
should
not
one
of
these
he
paused
unable
to
find
himself
his
confusion
obvious
he
was
as
glad
of
the
interruption
that
was
then
provided
by
the
arrival
of
imson
as
his
audience
was
toogood
certainly
was
not
sorry
he
need
find
no
immediate
answer
he
sipped
his
drink
and
made
mental
notes
imson
arrived
in
a
rough
brown
ulster
with
the
collar
turned
up
about
his
ears
a
low
flannel
shirt
not
strictly
clean
lying
loosely
round
his
neck
his
colourless
face
was
of
somewhat
flabby
texture
due
probably
to
his
diet
but
its
simple
honest
expression
was
attractive
the
smile
engaging
the
touch
of
foolishness
might
have
been
childlike
innocence
even
saintliness
some
thought
and
though
he
was
well
over
forty
the
unlined
skin
made
him
look
more
like
thirty
he
enjoyed
a
physiognomy
not
unlike
that
of
a
horse
or
sheep
his
big
brown
eyes
stared
wide
open
at
the
world
expecting
wonder
and
finding
it
his
hobby
was
inspirational
poems
one
lay
in
his
breast
pocket
now
he
burned
to
read
it
aloud
pat
imson
ideal
was
an
odd
one
detachment
the
desire
to
avoid
all
ties
that
must
bring
him
back
to
future
incarnations
on
the
earth
to
eschew
making
fresh
karma
in
a
word
he
considered
himself
an
old
soul
and
was
rather
weary
of
it
all
of
existence
and
development
that
is
to
take
no
part
in
life
meant
to
escape
from
those
tangles
for
whose
unravelling
the
law
of
rebirth
dragged
the
soul
back
again
and
again
to
sow
no
causes
was
to
have
no
harvest
of
effects
to
reap
with
toil
and
perspiration
action
of
course
there
must
be
but
indifference
to
results
of
action
was
the
secret
imson
none
the
less
was
always
entangled
with
wives
and
children
having
divorced
one
wife
and
been
divorced
by
another
he
had
recently
married
a
third
a
flock
of
children
streamed
behind
him
he
was
a
good
father
if
a
strange
husband
it
old
karma
i
have
to
work
off
he
would
explain
referring
to
the
wives
if
i
avoid
the
experience
i
shall
only
have
to
come
back
again
there
no
good
shirking
old
karma
he
gave
this
explanation
to
the
wives
themselves
not
only
to
his
friends
face
it
and
it
done
with
worked
off
you
see
that
is
it
had
to
be
done
nicely
kindly
generously
an
entire
absence
of
the
sense
of
humour
was
of
course
his
natural
gift
yet
a
certain
quaint
wisdom
helped
to
fill
the
dangerous
vacuum
he
was
known
usually
as
pat
come
on
pat
said
povey
making
room
for
him
at
his
side
karma
we
just
talking
about
levallon
and
the
studio
business
what
do
you
make
of
it
you
were
there
were
you
the
others
listened
attentively
for
imson
had
a
reputation
for
seeing
true
i
saw
it
yes
replied
imson
ordering
his
dinner
with
indifference
soup
fried
potatoes
salad
cheese
and
coffee
but
declining
the
offered
wine
the
group
waited
for
his
next
remark
but
none
was
forthcoming
he
sat
crumbling
his
bread
into
the
soup
and
stirring
the
mixture
with
his
spoon
did
you
see
the
light
about
him
mr
imson
asked
miss
lance
the
brilliant
aura
of
golden
yellow
that
he
wore
thought
it
sounds
exaggerated
i
know
but
to
me
it
seemed
even
brighter
than
the
lightning
did
you
notice
it
well
said
imson
slowly
putting
his
spoon
down
i
not
often
clairvoyant
you
know
i
did
notice
however
a
sort
of
radiance
about
him
but
with
hair
like
that
it
difficult
to
be
certain
full
of
lovely
patterns
said
towzer
geometrical
patterns
like
astrological
designs
mentioned
miss
milligan
he
leo
of
course
fire
almost
as
though
he
brought
or
caused
the
lightning
as
if
it
actually
emanated
out
of
his
atmosphere
somehow
claimed
miss
lance
for
it
was
conversation
after
all
i
saw
nothing
of
that
replied
imson
quietly
no
i
ca
say
i
saw
anything
like
that
he
added
honestly
with
his
engaging
smile
that
had
earned
for
him
in
some
quarters
the
nickname
of
the
sheep
i
was
looking
at
nayan
you
see
most
of
the
time
a
smile
flickered
round
the
table
for
rumour
had
it
that
the
girl
had
once
seemed
to
him
as
possible
karma
so
was
i
put
in
kempster
with
kindly
intention
though
his
sympathy
was
evidently
not
needed
imson
was
too
simple
even
to
feel
embarrassment
she
came
to
life
suddenly
for
the
first
time
since
i
known
her
it
was
amazing
to
which
imson
busy
over
his
made
no
reply
povey
lighting
his
pipe
and
puffing
out
thick
clouds
of
smoke
was
cleverer
levallon
effect
upon
her
whatever
it
was
seemed
instantaneous
he
informed
the
table
i
never
saw
a
clearer
case
of
two
souls
coming
together
in
a
flash
as
i
said
just
now
kempster
quickly
mentioned
they
are
similar
said
imson
looking
up
while
the
group
waited
expectantly
similar
repeated
kempster
ah
it
was
the
surprise
in
her
face
that
struck
me
most
observed
povey
quickly
making
an
internal
note
of
imson
adjective
but
knowing
that
indirect
methods
would
draw
him
out
better
than
questions
levallon
showed
it
too
it
was
an
unexpected
recognition
on
both
sides
they
are
as
you
say
both
at
the
same
stage
of
development
whatever
that
stage
may
be
the
expression
on
both
faces
escape
exclaimed
imson
giving
at
last
the
kernel
of
what
he
had
to
say
and
the
effect
upon
the
group
was
electrical
a
visible
thrill
ran
round
the
soho
table
the
very
word
exclaimed
povey
and
miss
lance
together
escape
but
neither
of
them
knew
exactly
what
they
meant
nor
what
imson
himself
meant
levallon
has
of
course
already
escaped
the
latter
went
on
quietly
he
is
no
longer
caught
by
causes
and
effects
as
we
are
here
he
got
out
of
it
all
long
ago
if
he
was
ever
in
it
at
all
if
he
ever
was
in
it
at
all
said
povey
quickly
you
noticed
that
too
you
very
discerning
pat
clairvoyant
mentioned
miss
lance
i
seen
them
in
dreams
like
that
returned
imson
calmly
i
often
see
them
of
course
he
referred
to
his
qualification
for
membership
the
great
figures
i
see
in
dream
have
just
that
unearthly
expression
unearthly
said
towzer
with
excitement
mentioned
kempster
suggestively
not
of
this
world
anyhow
suggested
miss
lance
mysteriously
divine
inquired
miss
milligan
below
her
breath
really
murmured
toogood
i
must
get
a
bit
of
his
hair
and
psychometrize
it
at
once
he
was
sipping
a
second
glass
of
whisky
imson
looked
round
at
each
face
in
turn
apparently
seeing
nothing
that
need
increase
his
attachment
to
the
planet
by
way
of
fresh
karma
the
world
he
said
briefly
after
a
pause
probably
he
come
to
take
nayan
off
with
him
she
i
always
said
so
has
a
strong
strain
of
the
elemental
kingdom
in
her
she
may
be
his
levallon
sure
is
here
for
the
first
time
he
one
of
the
evolution
he
slipped
in
a
himself
probably
it
was
as
though
he
said
that
the
waiter
was
swiss
or
french
or
that
the
proprietor
daughter
had
italian
blood
in
her
povey
looked
round
him
with
an
air
of
triumph
ah
he
announced
as
who
should
say
you
all
thought
my
version
a
bit
wild
but
here
confirmation
from
an
unbiased
witness
oh
well
i
ca
be
certain
imson
reminded
the
group
if
he
deceived
them
enough
to
change
their
lives
in
any
respect
it
involved
fresh
karma
for
himself
care
was
indicated
i
ca
be
positive
can
i
he
hedged
only
i
must
say
the
great
i
seen
in
dream
have
exactly
that
look
and
expression
that
interesting
pat
povey
put
in
because
before
you
came
i
was
suggesting
a
similar
explanation
for
his
air
of
immense
potential
power
the
elemental
atmosphere
he
brought
we
all
noticed
it
of
course
elemental
the
only
word
miss
lance
inserted
a
great
nature
being
she
was
thinking
of
her
magazine
he
struck
me
as
being
so
close
to
nature
that
he
seemed
literally
part
of
it
that
would
explain
the
lightning
and
the
strange
cry
he
gave
about
replied
imson
wiping
the
oil
from
his
chin
and
sprinkling
his
with
powdered
sugar
it
quite
likely
enough
i
wish
you
jot
down
what
you
think
a
little
report
of
what
you
saw
and
felt
the
secretary
mentioned
it
would
be
of
great
value
i
thought
of
making
a
collection
of
the
different
versions
and
accounts
they
might
be
published
some
day
thought
miss
lance
let
all
she
added
aloud
with
emphasis
imson
nodded
agreement
making
no
audible
reply
while
the
conversation
ran
on
gathering
impetus
as
it
went
growing
wilder
possibly
but
also
more
picturesque
a
man
in
the
street
listening
behind
a
curtain
must
have
deemed
the
talkers
suffering
from
delusion
mad
a
good
psychologist
on
the
other
hand
similarly
screened
and
knowing
the
antecedent
facts
the
studio
scene
at
any
rate
must
have
been
struck
by
one
outstanding
detail
the
effect
namely
upon
one
and
all
of
the
person
they
discussed
they
had
seen
him
for
an
hour
or
so
among
a
crowd
a
young
man
whose
name
they
hardly
knew
only
a
few
had
spoken
to
him
there
had
been
it
seemed
neither
time
nor
opportunity
for
him
to
produce
upon
one
and
all
the
impression
he
undoubtedly
had
produced
for
in
every
mind
upon
every
heart
levallon
mere
presence
had
evidently
graven
an
unforgettable
image
scored
an
undecipherable
hieroglyph
each
felt
it
seemed
the
hint
of
a
personality
their
knowledge
could
not
explain
nor
any
earthly
explanation
satisfy
the
consciousness
in
each
one
perhaps
had
been
quickened
hence
possibly
the
extravagance
of
their
conversation
yet
since
all
reported
differently
collective
hysteria
seemed
discounted
meanwhile
as
the
talk
continued
and
the
wings
of
imaginative
speculation
fanned
the
thick
tobacco
smoke
others
had
dropped
in
both
male
and
female
members
and
the
group
now
filled
the
little
room
to
the
walls
the
same
magnet
drew
them
all
in
each
heart
burned
the
same
huge
question
mark
who
what
is
this
levallon
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
scene
in
khilkoff
studio
here
too
was
a
curious
and
significant
fact
about
the
gathering
the
amount
of
knowledge
true
or
otherwise
they
had
managed
to
collect
about
levallon
one
way
or
another
no
one
could
say
exactly
how
the
society
had
picked
up
an
astonishing
array
of
detail
they
now
shared
together
it
was
known
where
he
had
spent
his
youth
also
how
and
with
whom
as
well
as
something
of
the
different
views
about
him
held
by
devonham
and
edward
fillery
to
such
temperaments
as
theirs
the
strange
the
unusual
came
automatically
perhaps
percolating
into
their
minds
as
though
a
collective
power
of
operated
garbled
fanciful
askew
their
information
may
have
been
but
a
great
deal
of
it
was
not
far
wrong
imson
for
instance
provided
an
account
of
levallon
birth
to
which
all
listened
spellbound
he
evaded
all
questions
as
to
how
he
knew
of
it
his
parents
he
assured
the
room
practised
the
old
forgotten
magic
his
father
at
any
rate
was
an
expert
if
not
an
initiate
with
all
the
rites
and
formulæ
of
ancient
times
in
his
memory
levallon
was
born
as
the
result
of
an
experiment
its
origins
dating
back
so
far
that
they
concerned
life
upon
another
planet
i
believe
a
planet
nearer
to
the
sun
the
tremendous
winds
and
heat
were
vehicles
of
deity
you
see
the
parents
you
mean
had
former
lives
upon
another
planet
asked
someone
in
a
hushed
tone
or
he
himself
the
parents
and
mason
mason
was
involved
in
the
experiment
that
resulted
in
the
birth
of
levallon
here
the
experiment
what
was
it
exactly
inquired
lattimer
while
toogood
surreptitiously
made
notes
on
his
rather
dirty
cuff
imson
shrugged
his
shoulders
very
slightly
some
of
it
came
to
me
in
sleep
he
mentioned
producing
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
beginning
to
read
it
aloud
before
anyone
could
stop
him
when
the
sun
was
younger
and
moon
and
stars
were
thrilled
with
my
human
birth
and
the
winds
fled
shouting
the
wondrous
news
as
they
circled
the
sea
and
the
earth
from
the
fight
for
money
and
worldly
fame
i
drew
one
magical
soul
who
came
to
me
over
the
sea
as
the
needle
turns
to
the
pole
conceived
in
the
hour
the
stars
foretold
this
son
of
the
winds
i
bore
and
i
taught
him
the
secrets
of
yes
interrupted
povey
audaciously
but
the
experiment
you
were
telling
us
about
a
murmur
of
approving
voices
helped
him
oh
the
experiment
yes
well
all
i
know
is
he
went
on
with
conviction
calmly
replacing
the
poem
in
his
pocket
that
it
concerned
an
old
rite
involving
the
evocation
of
some
elemental
being
or
the
three
of
them
had
already
evoked
millions
of
years
before
but
had
not
banished
again
the
experiment
they
made
was
to
restore
it
to
its
proper
sphere
in
order
to
do
so
they
had
to
evoke
it
again
and
of
course
he
glanced
round
as
though
all
present
were
familiar
with
the
formula
of
magical
practices
it
could
come
only
through
the
channel
of
a
human
system
of
course
yes
murmured
a
dozen
voices
while
eyes
grew
bigger
and
a
pin
dropping
must
have
been
audible
well
imson
spoke
very
slowly
now
each
word
clear
as
a
bell
the
father
who
was
officiating
failed
he
could
not
stand
the
strain
his
heart
stopped
beating
he
died
just
when
was
there
he
dropped
dead
what
happened
to
asked
povey
too
interested
to
care
that
he
no
longer
led
the
room
you
said
it
could
only
use
a
human
system
as
channel
it
did
so
explained
imson
the
information
produced
a
pause
of
several
seconds
some
of
the
members
like
toogood
though
openly
were
making
pencil
notes
upon
cuffs
or
backs
of
envelopes
but
the
channel
was
neither
mason
nor
the
woman
the
effect
of
this
negative
information
was
as
nothing
compared
to
the
startling
interest
produced
by
the
speaker
next
words
it
took
the
easiest
channel
the
line
of
least
resistance
the
unborn
body
of
the
child
povey
seizing
his
opportunity
leaped
into
the
silence
whose
body
now
full
grown
and
named
levallon
came
to
the
studio
he
exclaimed
looking
round
at
the
group
as
though
he
had
himself
given
the
explanation
all
had
just
listened
to
a
human
body
tenanted
by
a
one
of
the
a
chapter
xviii
for
all
the
wildness
of
the
talk
this
group
of
the
unstable
was
a
coherent
and
consistent
entity
using
a
language
each
item
in
it
understood
they
knew
what
they
were
after
alcohol
coffee
tobacco
underfeeding
these
helped
or
hindered
respectively
the
expression
of
an
ideal
that
nevertheless
was
common
to
them
all
and
if
the
minds
represented
were
unbalanced
or
merely
speculative
poetic
one
genuine
quest
and
sympathy
bound
all
together
into
a
coherent
and
who
shall
say
unintelligent
or
valueless
unit
the
unstable
enjoyed
an
extreme
sensitiveness
to
varied
experience
with
flexible
adaptability
to
all
possible
new
conditions
whereas
the
stable
with
their
rigid
mental
organizations
remained
uninformed
stagnant
even
fossilized
in
other
rooms
about
the
great
city
sat
doubtless
other
similar
groups
at
the
very
same
moment
discussing
the
shibboleths
of
other
faiths
of
other
dreams
of
other
ideas
systems
notions
philosophies
all
interpretative
of
the
earth
in
which
little
humanity
dwells
cut
off
and
isolated
apparently
from
the
rest
of
the
stupendous
universe
a
listener
screened
from
view
a
listener
not
in
sympathy
with
the
particular
group
he
observed
and
puzzled
therefore
by
the
language
used
must
have
deemed
he
listened
to
harmless
if
boring
madness
for
each
group
uses
its
own
language
and
the
lowest
common
denominator
though
plainly
printed
in
the
world
old
scriptures
has
not
yet
become
adopted
by
the
world
at
large
into
this
particular
group
a
little
later
in
the
evening
and
when
the
wings
of
imagination
had
increased
their
sweep
a
trifle
dangerously
perhaps
into
the
room
like
the
arrival
of
a
policeman
rather
dropped
father
collins
he
came
rarely
to
the
prometheans
restaurant
there
was
a
general
sense
of
drawing
breath
as
he
appeared
a
pause
followed
something
of
the
cold
street
air
came
with
him
he
wore
his
big
black
felt
hat
his
shabby
opera
cloak
and
clutched
firmly
he
had
no
gloves
on
the
heavy
gnarled
stick
he
had
cut
for
his
collection
in
a
cingalese
forest
years
ago
when
he
was
studying
with
a
buddhist
priest
the
folds
of
his
voluminous
cloak
as
he
took
it
off
sent
the
hanging
in
a
whirl
his
personality
stirred
the
mental
atmosphere
as
well
the
women
looked
up
and
stared
respectful
welcome
in
their
eyes
several
of
the
men
rose
to
shake
hands
there
was
a
general
shuffling
of
chairs
bring
another
à
and
a
clean
glass
povey
said
at
once
to
the
hovering
waiter
it
raw
and
bitter
in
the
street
and
a
fog
coming
down
thickly
mentioned
father
collins
he
exhaled
noisily
and
with
comfortable
relief
as
he
squeezed
himself
towards
the
chair
povey
placed
for
him
and
looked
round
genially
nodding
and
shaking
hands
with
those
he
knew
but
you
warm
and
cosy
enough
in
here
he
sat
down
with
unexpected
heaviness
and
smiled
at
everybody
and
well
fed
too
be
bound
body
must
be
comfortable
before
the
mind
can
enjoy
itself
said
phillipps
an
untidy
member
who
disliked
asceticism
starvation
produces
hallucination
not
vision
his
glance
took
in
the
unused
glasses
his
qualification
was
a
vision
of
an
uncle
at
the
moment
of
death
and
the
uncle
had
left
him
money
he
had
written
a
wordy
pamphlet
describing
it
i
have
an
omelette
then
i
think
father
collins
told
the
waiter
as
the
red
wine
arrived
and
some
fried
potatoes
a
bit
of
cheese
to
follow
and
coffee
yes
he
filled
his
glass
he
had
not
come
to
argue
or
to
preach
and
phillipps
challenge
passed
unnoticed
phillipps
who
had
been
leading
the
talk
of
late
resented
the
new
arrival
but
felt
his
annoyance
modify
as
he
saw
his
own
glass
generously
filled
povey
too
accepted
a
glass
while
saying
with
a
false
vehemence
no
no
his
finger
against
the
rim
a
change
stole
over
the
room
for
the
new
personality
was
not
negligible
he
brought
his
atmosphere
with
him
the
wild
talk
it
was
felt
now
would
not
be
quite
suitable
father
collins
had
the
reputation
of
being
something
of
a
scholar
they
were
not
quite
sure
of
him
none
knew
him
very
intimately
he
had
a
rumoured
past
as
well
that
lent
a
flavour
of
respect
one
story
had
it
that
dabbling
in
magic
had
lost
him
his
position
in
the
church
yet
he
was
deemed
an
asset
to
the
society
whatever
it
was
the
key
changed
sharply
imson
eyes
and
ears
grew
wider
the
hand
of
miss
lance
went
instinctively
to
her
hair
and
combs
miss
milligan
sought
through
her
mind
for
a
remark
at
once
instructive
and
uncommon
towzer
looked
past
him
searchingly
lest
his
aura
escape
her
before
she
caught
its
colour
and
kempster
smoothing
his
immaculate
coat
had
an
air
of
being
in
his
present
surroundings
merely
by
chance
toogood
quickly
scanning
his
notes
wondered
whether
if
called
upon
he
was
to
be
pharaoh
or
cleopatra
one
and
all
that
is
took
on
a
soberer
gait
this
visit
complicated
the
presence
of
father
collins
was
a
compliment
what
he
had
to
say
about
levallon
and
the
studio
scene
was
anyhow
assured
of
breathless
interest
povey
led
off
we
were
just
talking
over
the
other
night
he
observed
the
night
at
the
studio
you
remember
the
storm
and
so
on
it
was
a
singular
occurrence
though
of
course
we
need
we
exaggerate
it
and
while
he
thus
as
secretary
set
the
note
father
collins
sipped
his
wine
and
beamed
upon
the
group
he
made
no
comment
you
were
there
were
you
continued
povey
sipping
his
own
comforting
glass
i
think
i
saw
you
fillery
you
may
have
noticed
he
added
brought
a
friend
levallon
yes
said
the
other
in
a
tone
that
startled
them
a
most
unusual
fellow
was
he
he
was
attacking
the
omelette
now
a
greek
god
if
ever
i
saw
one
he
added
and
the
silence
in
the
crowded
room
became
abruptly
noticeable
miss
milligan
feeling
her
zodiacal
garter
slipping
waited
to
pull
it
up
imson
brown
eyes
grew
wider
kempster
held
his
breath
toogood
borrowed
a
cigar
and
waited
for
someone
to
offer
him
a
match
before
he
lit
it
delicious
added
father
collins
cooked
to
a
turn
the
omelette
slid
about
his
plate
but
the
silence
continued
and
he
realized
the
position
suddenly
emptying
his
glass
and
casually
refilling
it
he
turned
and
faced
the
eager
group
about
him
you
want
to
know
what
thought
about
it
all
he
said
been
discussing
levallon
nayan
and
the
rest
i
see
he
looked
round
as
though
he
were
in
the
lost
pulpit
that
was
his
right
after
a
pause
he
asked
point
blank
and
what
do
all
think
of
it
how
did
it
strike
you
all
for
myself
i
confess
he
took
another
sip
and
paused
i
am
full
of
wonder
and
question
he
finished
abruptly
it
was
imson
the
fearless
wondering
pat
imson
who
first
found
his
tongue
we
think
he
ventured
levallon
is
probably
of
origin
the
others
while
admiring
his
courage
seemed
unsympathetic
suddenly
such
phraseology
probably
meaningless
to
the
respected
guest
was
out
of
place
eyes
were
cast
down
or
looked
generally
elsewhere
povey
remembering
that
the
society
was
not
solely
eastern
glared
at
the
speaker
father
collins
however
was
not
perturbed
possibly
he
remarked
with
a
courteous
smile
the
origin
of
us
all
is
doubtful
and
confused
we
know
not
whence
we
come
of
course
and
all
that
nor
can
we
ever
tell
exactly
who
our
neighbour
is
or
what
levallon
he
went
on
since
you
all
ask
me
he
looked
round
again
is
for
me
an
undecipherable
being
i
am
he
added
his
words
falling
into
open
mouths
and
extended
eyes
and
ears
somewhat
puzzled
but
more
i
am
enormously
stimulated
and
intrigued
all
gazed
at
him
father
collins
was
in
his
element
the
rapt
silence
that
met
him
was
precisely
what
he
had
a
right
to
expect
from
his
lost
pulpit
he
had
come
probably
merely
to
listen
and
to
watch
the
opportunity
provided
by
a
respectful
audience
was
too
much
for
him
an
inspiration
tempted
him
i
am
inclined
to
believe
he
resumed
suddenly
in
a
simple
tone
that
he
is
a
messenger
the
sentence
might
have
dropped
from
sirius
upon
a
listening
planet
the
babble
that
followed
must
to
an
ordinary
man
have
seemed
confusion
everyone
spoke
with
a
rush
into
his
neighbour
ear
all
bubbled
i
always
thought
so
i
told
you
so
that
was
exactly
what
i
meant
just
now
and
so
on
all
found
their
tongues
at
any
rate
if
povey
as
secretary
led
the
turmoil
something
outside
our
normal
evolution
you
mean
he
asked
judiciously
such
a
conception
is
possible
of
course
a
messenger
ran
on
the
babel
of
male
and
female
voices
it
was
here
that
father
collins
failed
the
unstable
in
him
came
suddenly
uppermost
the
ecstatic
in
his
being
took
the
reins
the
wondering
and
expectant
audience
suited
him
the
red
wine
helped
as
well
when
he
said
messenger
he
had
meant
merely
someone
who
brought
a
message
the
expression
of
nobility
merged
more
and
more
in
the
slovenly
aspect
like
a
priest
in
the
pulpit
whom
none
can
answer
and
to
whom
all
must
listen
he
had
his
text
though
that
text
had
been
suggested
actually
by
the
conversation
he
had
just
heard
he
had
not
brought
it
with
him
it
occurred
to
him
merely
then
and
there
his
mind
reflected
in
a
word
the
collective
idea
that
was
in
the
air
about
him
and
he
proceeded
to
sum
it
up
and
give
expression
to
it
this
was
his
gift
his
fatal
gift
a
ready
sensitiveness
a
plausible
exposition
he
caught
the
prevailing
mood
the
collective
notion
then
dramatized
it
before
he
left
the
pulpit
he
invariably
however
convinced
himself
that
what
he
had
said
in
it
was
true
inspired
a
revelation
for
that
moment
a
messenger
he
announced
thrusting
his
glass
aside
with
an
impatient
gesture
as
though
noticing
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
there
a
messenger
he
repeated
the
automatic
emphasis
in
his
voice
already
persuading
him
that
he
believed
what
he
was
about
to
say
sent
among
us
from
who
knows
what
distant
sphere
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
about
him
and
for
who
can
guess
on
what
mysterious
and
splendid
mission
his
eye
swept
his
audience
his
hand
removed
the
glass
yet
farther
lest
it
impede
free
gesture
it
was
however
as
povey
noticed
empty
now
we
of
course
he
went
on
impressively
lowering
his
voice
a
mere
handful
in
the
world
but
alert
and
watchful
all
of
us
we
know
that
some
great
new
teaching
is
expected
he
threw
out
another
challenging
glance
but
none
of
us
can
know
whence
it
may
come
nor
in
what
way
it
shall
manifest
his
voice
dropped
dramatically
whether
as
a
thief
in
the
night
or
with
a
blare
of
trumpets
none
of
us
can
tell
but
we
expect
it
and
are
ready
to
therefore
perhaps
as
to
the
twelve
fishermen
of
old
may
be
entrusted
the
privilege
of
accepting
it
the
work
of
spreading
it
among
a
hostile
and
unbelieving
world
even
perhaps
the
final
sacrifice
of
of
suffering
for
it
he
paused
quickly
took
in
the
general
effect
of
his
words
picked
up
here
and
there
a
hint
of
question
and
realized
that
he
had
begun
on
too
exalted
a
note
detecting
this
breath
of
caution
in
the
collective
mind
that
was
his
inspiration
he
instantly
shifted
his
key
levallon
he
resumed
instinctively
emphasizing
the
conviction
in
his
voice
so
that
the
change
of
key
might
be
less
noticeable
undoubtedly
believes
himself
to
be
some
such
divine
messenger
it
was
consummate
hedging
the
sermon
needs
no
full
report
the
audience
without
realizing
it
witnessed
what
is
known
as
an
inspirational
address
where
a
speaker
naturally
gifted
with
a
certain
facile
eloquence
gathers
his
inspiration
takes
his
changing
cues
as
well
from
the
collective
mind
that
listens
to
him
father
collins
quite
honestly
doubtless
altered
his
key
automatically
he
no
longer
said
that
levallon
a
messenger
but
that
he
believed
himself
to
be
one
like
balaam
he
said
things
he
had
not
at
first
thought
of
saying
he
talked
for
some
ten
minutes
without
stopping
he
said
all
sorts
of
things
according
to
the
expression
of
critical
doubt
of
wonder
of
question
of
rejection
or
acceptance
on
the
particular
face
he
gazed
at
at
regular
intervals
he
inserted
with
considerable
effect
his
favourite
sentence
a
man
in
his
place
is
the
ruler
of
his
fate
he
developed
his
idea
that
levallon
believed
himself
to
be
such
and
such
but
declared
that
the
conception
had
been
put
into
the
youth
during
his
life
of
exile
in
the
mountains
the
society
had
already
acquired
this
information
and
extended
it
and
had
himself
the
rôle
until
he
had
become
its
actual
embodiment
he
does
not
think
he
does
not
reason
he
explained
he
feels
he
now
to
with
anything
is
to
become
it
in
the
end
it
is
the
only
way
of
true
knowledge
of
course
of
true
understanding
if
i
want
to
understand
say
an
arab
i
must
that
arab
to
the
point
for
the
moment
of
actually
becoming
him
and
this
strange
youth
has
spent
his
time
his
best
years
mark
you
his
creative
years
the
elemental
forces
of
nature
until
he
has
actually
becomes
at
moments
one
with
them
he
paused
again
and
stared
about
him
he
saw
faces
shocked
astonished
startled
but
not
hostile
he
continued
rapidly
there
lies
the
danger
one
may
get
caught
get
stuck
lose
the
desire
to
return
to
one
normal
self
which
means
of
course
remaining
out
of
relation
with
one
environment
mad
only
a
man
in
his
place
is
the
ruler
of
his
luck
he
noticed
suddenly
the
look
of
disappointment
on
several
faces
he
swiftly
hedged
on
the
other
hand
he
went
on
making
his
voice
and
manner
more
impressive
than
before
it
may
be
who
can
say
indeed
it
may
be
that
he
is
in
relation
with
another
environment
altogether
a
much
vaster
environment
an
extended
environment
of
which
the
rest
of
humanity
is
unaware
the
privilege
of
tasting
something
of
an
extended
environment
some
of
us
here
already
enjoy
what
we
all
know
as
activities
are
doubtless
but
a
fragment
of
life
the
conscious
phenomena
merely
of
some
larger
whole
of
which
we
are
aware
in
fleeting
seconds
only
by
mood
by
hint
by
suggestive
hauntings
so
to
speak
by
faint
shadows
of
unfamiliar
nameless
shape
cast
across
our
daily
life
from
some
intenser
sun
we
normally
can
not
see
levallon
may
be
as
some
of
us
think
and
hope
a
messenger
to
show
us
the
way
into
a
yet
farther
field
of
consciousness
it
is
a
fine
a
noble
an
inspiring
hope
at
any
rate
he
assured
the
room
unless
some
such
messenger
comes
into
the
world
showing
us
how
to
extend
our
knowledge
we
can
get
no
farther
we
shall
never
know
more
than
we
know
now
we
shall
only
go
on
multiplying
our
channels
for
observing
the
same
old
things
he
closed
his
little
address
finally
on
a
word
as
to
what
attitude
should
be
adopted
to
any
new
experience
of
amazing
and
incredible
kind
to
a
society
such
as
the
one
he
had
the
honour
of
belonging
to
was
left
the
guidance
of
the
perverse
and
ignorant
generations
outside
of
it
the
lethargic
and
unresponsive
majority
as
he
styled
them
we
must
not
resist
he
declared
bravely
we
must
accept
with
confidence
above
all
without
fear
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
somewhat
exhausted
for
the
source
of
his
inspiration
was
evidently
weakening
his
words
came
less
spontaneously
less
easily
he
hesitated
sighed
looked
from
face
to
face
for
help
he
did
not
find
his
glass
was
empty
we
here
he
concluded
lamely
without
being
consulted
and
we
may
safely
leave
to
the
powers
that
brought
us
here
the
results
of
such
acceptance
quite
so
agreed
povey
sighing
audibly
denial
will
get
us
nowhere
he
filled
up
father
collins
glass
and
his
own
i
think
most
of
us
are
ready
enough
to
accept
any
new
experience
that
comes
and
to
accept
it
without
fear
he
drained
his
own
glass
and
looked
about
him
but
the
point
is
how
did
levallon
produce
the
effect
upon
us
all
the
effect
he
did
produce
he
may
be
or
he
may
be
merely
mad
he
may
as
imson
says
come
to
us
by
some
godless
chance
from
another
evolutionary
system
of
which
mind
you
we
have
as
yet
no
positive
knowledge
or
he
may
be
a
messenger
as
father
collins
suggests
from
some
divine
source
bringing
new
teaching
but
in
the
name
of
magic
how
did
he
manage
it
in
other
words
what
is
he
for
povey
could
be
very
ruthless
when
he
chose
it
was
this
ruthlessness
perhaps
that
made
him
such
an
efficient
secretary
the
note
of
extravagance
in
his
language
had
possibly
another
inspiration
an
awkward
pause
at
any
rate
followed
his
remarks
father
collins
had
comforted
and
blessed
the
group
povey
introduced
cold
water
rather
there
this
and
there
that
remarked
miss
milligan
tactfully
those
among
us
added
miss
lance
with
sympathy
who
have
the
sight
know
at
least
what
they
have
seen
still
i
think
we
are
indebted
to
father
collins
for
his
guidance
if
we
knew
exactly
what
he
is
mentioned
towzer
referring
to
levallon
we
should
know
exactly
where
we
are
they
got
up
to
go
there
was
a
fumbling
among
crowded
what
is
he
offered
kempster
he
certainly
made
us
all
sit
up
and
take
notice
no
mere
earthly
figure
suggested
imson
could
have
produced
the
effect
did
in
my
poem
it
came
to
me
in
sleep
father
collins
held
his
glass
unsteadily
to
the
light
a
messenger
he
interrupted
with
authority
would
affect
us
all
differently
remember
the
talk
continued
in
this
fashion
for
a
considerable
time
while
all
searched
for
wraps
and
coats
the
waiter
brought
the
bill
amid
general
confusion
but
no
one
noticed
him
all
were
otherwise
engaged
povey
paid
it
finally
putting
it
down
to
the
entertainment
account
remember
he
said
as
they
stood
in
a
group
on
the
restaurant
steps
each
wondering
who
would
provide
a
lift
home
remember
we
have
all
got
to
write
out
an
account
of
what
we
saw
and
heard
at
the
studio
these
reports
will
be
valuable
they
will
appear
in
our
bulletin
first
then
i
have
them
bound
into
a
volume
and
i
shall
try
and
get
levallon
to
give
us
a
lecture
too
tickets
will
be
extra
of
course
but
each
member
can
bring
a
friend
i
let
you
all
know
the
date
in
due
course
chapter
xix
while
the
prometheans
thus
individually
and
collectively
fermenting
floundered
between
old
and
new
interpretations
of
a
strange
occurrence
in
another
part
of
london
something
was
happening
of
its
kind
so
real
so
interesting
that
one
and
all
would
eagerly
have
renounced
a
favourite
shibboleth
or
pet
desire
to
witness
it
kempster
would
have
eaten
a
raw
beefsteak
lattimer
have
agreed
to
rebirth
as
a
woman
towzer
have
swallowed
whisky
neat
and
even
toogood
have
written
a
signed
confession
that
his
psychometry
was
intelligent
guesswork
it
is
the
destiny
however
of
such
students
of
the
wonderful
to
receive
their
data
invariably
at
second
or
third
hand
the
data
may
deal
with
genuine
occurrences
but
the
student
seems
never
himself
present
at
the
time
from
books
from
reports
from
accounts
of
someone
who
knew
an
actual
witness
the
student
generally
receives
the
version
he
then
proceeds
to
study
and
elaborate
in
this
particular
instance
moreover
no
version
ever
reached
their
ears
at
all
either
at
second
or
third
hand
because
the
only
witness
of
what
happened
was
edward
fillery
and
he
mentioned
it
to
no
one
its
reality
its
interpretation
likewise
remained
authoritative
only
for
that
expert
if
unstable
mind
that
experienced
the
one
and
divined
the
other
his
conversation
with
devonham
over
and
the
latter
having
retired
to
his
room
fillery
paid
a
last
visit
to
the
patient
who
was
now
his
private
care
instead
of
merely
an
inmate
of
the
institution
that
was
half
a
home
and
half
a
spiritual
clinique
the
figure
lay
sleeping
quietly
the
lean
muscular
body
bare
to
the
wind
that
blew
upon
it
from
the
open
window
graceful
motionless
both
pillow
and
coverings
rejected
breathed
the
calm
regular
breath
of
deepest
slumber
the
light
from
the
door
just
touched
the
face
and
folded
hands
the
features
wore
no
expression
of
any
kind
the
hair
drawn
back
from
the
forehead
and
temples
almost
seemed
to
shine
through
the
window
came
the
rustle
of
the
tossing
branches
but
the
night
air
though
damp
was
neither
raw
nor
biting
and
fillery
did
not
replace
the
sheets
upon
the
great
sleeping
body
he
withdrew
as
softly
as
he
entered
knowing
he
would
not
close
an
eye
that
night
he
left
the
house
silently
and
walked
out
into
the
deserted
streets
the
rain
had
ceased
but
the
wet
wind
rushed
in
gusts
against
him
the
soft
blows
and
heavy
moisture
acting
as
balm
to
his
somewhat
tired
nerves
as
with
great
elemental
hands
the
windy
darkness
stroked
him
soothing
away
the
intense
excitement
he
had
felt
muting
a
thousand
eager
questions
they
stroked
his
brain
into
a
gentler
silence
gradually
do
think
do
think
night
whispered
all
about
him
but
feel
feel
feel
what
you
want
to
know
will
come
to
you
by
feeling
now
he
obeyed
instinctively
down
the
long
empty
streets
he
passed
swinging
his
stick
tapping
the
lampposts
noting
how
steady
their
light
held
in
the
wind
noting
the
tossing
trees
in
little
gardens
noting
occasionally
rifts
of
moonlight
between
the
racing
clouds
but
relinquishing
all
attempt
to
think
he
counted
the
steps
between
the
as
he
swung
along
leaving
the
kerb
at
each
crossing
with
his
left
foot
taking
the
new
one
with
his
right
planting
each
boot
safely
in
the
centre
of
each
paving
stone
establishing
in
a
word
a
sort
of
rhythm
as
he
moved
he
did
so
however
without
being
consciously
aware
of
it
he
was
not
aware
indeed
of
anything
but
that
he
swung
along
with
this
pleasant
rhythmical
stride
that
rested
his
body
though
the
exercise
was
vigorous
and
the
night
laid
her
deep
peace
upon
him
as
he
went
the
streets
grew
narrower
twisted
turned
and
ran
uphill
the
houses
became
larger
spaced
farther
apart
less
numerous
their
gardens
bigger
with
groups
of
trees
instead
of
isolated
specimens
he
emerged
suddenly
upon
the
open
heath
tasting
a
newer
sweeter
air
the
huge
city
lay
below
him
now
but
the
rough
shouting
wind
drowned
its
distant
roar
completely
for
a
time
he
stood
and
watched
its
twinkling
lights
across
the
vapours
that
hung
between
then
turned
towards
the
little
pond
he
knew
it
well
its
waves
flew
dancing
happily
the
familiar
outline
of
jack
straw
castle
loomed
beyond
the
square
enclosure
of
the
gun
rattled
with
a
metallic
sound
in
the
wind
he
had
been
walking
for
the
best
part
of
two
hours
now
thinking
nothing
but
feeling
only
and
his
perhaps
lay
still
inactive
the
mind
was
quiescent
certainly
his
being
subdued
and
lulled
by
the
rhythmic
movement
which
had
gained
upon
his
entire
system
the
sails
of
his
ship
hung
idly
becalmed
above
the
profound
deeps
below
it
was
these
deeps
the
mysterious
and
inexhaustible
region
below
the
surface
that
now
began
to
stir
there
stole
upon
him
a
dim
prophetic
sense
as
of
horizons
lifting
and
letting
in
new
light
he
glanced
about
him
the
moon
was
brighter
certainly
the
flying
scud
was
thinning
though
the
dawn
was
still
some
hours
away
but
it
was
not
the
light
of
moon
or
sun
or
stars
he
looked
for
it
was
no
outer
light
the
little
waves
fell
splashing
at
his
feet
he
watched
them
for
a
long
time
keeping
very
still
his
heart
his
mind
his
nerves
his
muscles
all
were
very
still
he
became
aware
that
new
big
powers
were
alert
and
close
hovering
above
the
world
feathering
the
race
like
wings
of
mighty
birds
the
waters
were
being
troubled
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
but
ever
with
the
same
pleasant
rhythm
that
was
in
him
to
the
pine
trees
where
he
paused
a
minute
listening
to
the
branches
shaking
and
singing
then
retraced
his
steps
along
the
ridge
every
yard
of
which
though
blurred
in
darkness
he
knew
and
recognized
below
on
his
left
lay
london
on
his
right
stretched
the
familiar
country
though
now
invisible
past
hendon
with
its
welsh
harp
wembley
and
on
towards
harrow
whose
church
steeple
would
catch
the
sunrise
before
very
long
he
reached
the
little
pond
again
and
heard
its
small
waves
rushing
and
tumbling
in
the
wind
he
stood
and
watched
them
listening
to
their
musical
wash
and
gurgle
the
waters
yes
were
being
troubled
despite
the
buffeting
wind
the
world
lay
even
stiller
now
about
him
no
single
human
being
had
he
seen
even
stiller
than
before
too
lay
heart
and
mind
within
him
the
latter
held
no
single
picture
he
was
aware
yes
of
horizons
lifting
of
great
powers
alert
and
close
the
interior
light
increased
he
felt
but
he
did
not
think
into
the
empty
chamber
of
his
being
swept
and
garnished
flashed
suddenly
then
as
in
picture
form
the
memory
of
all
that
he
knew
about
him
came
at
once
notes
and
journey
the
london
scenes
and
talks
his
own
observations
deductions
questionings
his
dreams
and
fears
and
yearnings
his
hope
and
wonder
all
came
in
a
clapping
instant
complete
and
simultaneous
into
his
opened
subconscious
being
floated
the
power
and
the
presence
of
that
bright
messenger
who
brought
glad
tidings
to
his
life
stood
beside
him
whispering
with
lips
that
were
the
darkness
and
with
words
that
were
the
wind
it
was
the
power
and
presence
of
that
lifted
the
horizon
and
let
in
light
his
body
lay
sleeping
miles
away
in
that
bed
against
an
open
window
this
was
his
real
presence
without
words
as
without
thought
understanding
came
the
appeal
of
was
direct
to
the
subliminal
mind
it
was
the
hidden
he
stimulated
hence
came
the
intensification
of
consciousness
in
all
who
had
to
do
with
him
and
it
operated
now
fillery
was
aware
of
defying
time
and
space
as
though
there
were
no
limits
to
his
being
faith
lights
fires
perception
wandered
down
those
dusky
the
mind
that
lead
through
trackless
depths
where
the
massed
heritage
of
the
lit
sometimes
by
a
flashing
light
reveal
incredible
incalculable
things
one
of
those
flashes
came
now
through
the
fissures
as
it
were
of
his
unstable
being
rose
the
marvellous
uncanny
gleam
his
eyes
were
opened
and
he
saw
the
label
he
realized
was
incorrect
inadequate
was
a
misnomer
more
than
human
both
different
to
and
greater
than
came
nearer
to
the
truth
a
being
from
other
conditions
certainly
belonging
to
another
order
an
order
whose
work
was
unremitting
service
rendered
with
joy
and
faithfulness
a
hierarchy
whose
service
included
the
entire
universe
the
stars
and
suns
and
nebulæ
earth
with
her
frail
humanity
but
an
insignificant
fraction
of
it
all
he
came
of
course
from
that
central
sea
of
energy
whence
all
life
pushing
irresistibly
outwards
into
form
first
arises
like
human
beings
he
came
thence
undoubtedly
but
more
directly
than
they
in
more
intimate
relations
therefore
with
the
elemental
powers
that
build
up
form
and
shape
the
destinies
of
matter
one
only
of
a
mighty
host
of
varying
degrees
and
powers
his
services
lay
interwoven
with
the
very
heart
and
processes
of
nature
herself
the
energies
of
heat
and
air
essentials
of
all
life
everywhere
were
his
handmaidens
he
worked
with
fire
and
wind
in
the
forms
he
helped
to
build
he
set
enthusiasm
and
energy
aglow
from
stars
and
he
came
now
into
humanity
using
the
limited
instrument
of
a
human
mechanism
a
mechanism
he
must
learn
to
master
without
breaking
it
a
human
brain
and
nerves
confined
him
he
could
deal
with
essences
only
those
essential
buried
powers
that
lie
ever
waiting
below
the
threshold
of
all
human
consciousness
linking
men
did
they
but
know
it
direct
with
the
sea
of
universal
life
which
is
inexhaustible
independent
of
space
and
time
the
fraction
of
his
nature
which
had
manifested
as
a
transient
levallon
was
gone
for
ever
merged
in
the
real
self
below
his
origin
was
already
forgotten
no
memory
of
it
lay
in
his
present
brain
he
must
suffer
training
education
and
he
turned
instinctively
to
those
whose
ideal
like
his
own
was
one
of
impersonal
service
to
a
woman
he
turned
and
to
a
man
his
recognition
guided
by
nature
was
sure
and
accurate
it
must
take
time
and
patience
sympathy
and
love
faith
belief
and
trust
and
the
labour
must
be
borne
by
one
man
chiefly
by
fillery
into
whose
life
had
come
this
strange
bright
messenger
carrying
glad
tidings
to
prove
at
last
that
man
was
greater
than
he
knew
that
the
hope
for
humanity
for
the
deteriorating
race
for
crumbling
civilization
lay
in
drawing
out
into
full
practical
consciousness
the
divine
powers
concealed
below
the
threshold
of
every
single
man
and
woman
but
how
in
what
practical
manner
what
instrument
could
they
use
the
human
mechanism
the
brain
the
mind
afforded
inadequate
means
of
manifestation
new
wines
into
old
skins
meant
disaster
knowledge
power
beyond
the
experience
of
the
race
needed
a
better
instrument
than
the
one
the
race
had
painfully
evolved
for
present
uses
new
powers
of
unknown
kinds
as
already
in
those
rare
cases
when
the
supernormal
forces
emerged
could
only
strain
the
machinery
and
cause
disorder
a
new
order
of
consciousness
required
another
a
different
equipment
and
the
idea
flashed
into
him
as
in
the
studio
when
he
watched
and
the
girl
father
collins
had
divined
its
possibility
as
well
the
idea
of
a
group
consciousness
a
collective
what
a
single
individual
might
not
be
able
to
resist
at
first
without
disaster
many
a
group
in
harmony
two
or
three
gathered
together
in
unison
these
might
provide
the
way
the
means
the
instrument
the
body
the
personal
merged
in
the
impersonal
he
exclaimed
to
the
night
about
him
already
aware
that
words
expression
failed
even
at
this
early
stage
of
understanding
beauty
art
where
words
form
colour
end
we
shall
construct
while
yet
using
these
as
far
as
they
go
a
new
vehicle
a
new
good
evenin
said
a
gruff
voice
good
evenin
sir
it
added
more
respectfully
after
a
second
inspection
turned
out
quite
fine
after
the
storm
aware
of
the
policeman
suddenly
fillery
started
and
turned
round
abruptly
evidently
he
had
uttered
his
thoughts
aloud
probably
had
cried
and
shouted
them
he
could
think
of
nothing
in
the
world
to
say
it
was
a
terrible
storm
i
hardly
ever
see
the
likes
of
it
the
man
was
looking
at
him
still
with
doubtful
curiosity
extraordinary
yes
fillery
managed
to
find
a
few
natural
words
it
was
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
to
be
out
and
his
position
by
the
pond
he
now
realized
might
have
suggested
an
undesirable
intention
it
made
sleep
impossible
and
i
came
out
to
to
take
a
walk
i
a
doctor
fillery
the
fillery
home
yes
sir
said
the
man
apparently
satisfied
he
looked
at
the
sky
all
blown
away
again
he
remarked
and
the
moon
that
nice
and
bright
fillery
offered
something
in
reply
then
moved
away
the
moon
he
noticed
was
indeed
nice
and
bright
now
the
heavy
lower
vapours
all
had
vanished
and
thin
cirrus
clouds
at
a
great
height
moved
slowly
before
an
upper
wind
the
stars
shone
clearly
and
a
faint
line
of
colour
gave
a
hint
of
dawn
not
far
away
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
nearly
four
it
impossible
impossible
he
thought
to
himself
the
pictures
he
had
been
seeing
still
hanging
before
his
eyes
it
was
all
feeling
merely
feeling
my
blood
my
heritage
asserting
themselves
upon
an
system
too
much
repression
evidently
i
must
find
an
outlet
my
caucasian
valley
again
he
walked
rapidly
his
mind
began
to
work
and
thinking
made
an
effort
to
replace
feeling
he
watched
himself
his
everyday
partially
resumed
its
sway
the
policeman
of
course
had
interrupted
the
flow
and
inrush
of
another
state
just
at
the
moment
when
a
flash
of
direct
knowledge
was
about
to
blaze
it
concerned
his
new
patient
in
another
moment
he
would
have
known
exactly
what
and
who
he
was
whence
he
came
the
purpose
and
the
powers
that
attended
him
the
policeman
and
inner
laughter
ran
through
him
at
this
juxtaposition
of
the
practical
and
the
transcendental
had
interfered
with
an
interesting
expansion
of
his
being
an
extension
of
consciousness
perhaps
a
touch
of
cosmic
consciousness
was
on
the
way
the
first
faint
quiver
of
its
coming
magical
with
wondrous
joy
had
touched
him
its
cause
its
origin
he
knew
not
yet
he
could
trace
both
to
the
effect
produced
upon
him
by
of
that
he
was
sure
this
effect
his
reasoning
mind
with
busy
analysis
and
criticism
had
hitherto
partially
suppressed
even
at
its
first
manifestation
in
charing
cross
station
criticism
silent
and
analysis
inactive
it
had
found
an
outlet
his
own
deep
inner
stillness
had
been
its
opportunity
then
came
the
practical
honest
simple
policeman
the
censor
who
received
so
much
a
week
to
keep
people
in
the
way
they
ought
to
follow
the
safe
broad
way
he
smiled
as
he
walked
rapidly
along
the
deserted
streets
he
knew
so
well
the
method
and
process
of
these
abnormal
states
in
others
as
he
swung
along
not
tired
now
but
rested
rather
and
invigorated
the
rhythm
of
motion
established
itself
again
a
nature
spirit
a
nature
being
another
order
of
life
entering
humanity
for
the
first
time
that
humanity
for
whose
welfare
it
or
was
it
he
had
worked
with
hosts
of
similar
beings
during
incalculable
ages
he
smiled
remembering
the
policeman
again
there
was
always
a
policeman
or
a
censor
oh
the
exits
beyond
safe
normal
states
of
being
the
exits
into
extended
fields
of
consciousness
into
an
outer
life
which
the
majority
led
by
the
best
minds
of
the
day
deny
with
an
oath
these
were
well
guarded
his
smile
as
he
thought
of
it
ran
from
his
lips
and
settled
in
the
eyes
lingering
a
moment
there
before
it
died
away
how
quiet
yet
unfamiliar
the
suburb
of
the
huge
city
lay
about
him
in
pale
the
studio
scene
how
distant
it
seemed
now
in
space
and
time
it
had
happened
weeks
ago
in
another
city
somewhere
devonham
his
cautious
experienced
assistant
how
far
away
he
belonged
to
another
age
the
prometheans
were
part
of
a
dream
in
childhood
a
dream
of
pantomime
or
harlequinade
whose
extravagance
yet
conveyed
symbolic
meaning
two
figures
alone
retained
a
reality
that
refused
to
be
dismissed
a
mysterious
enigmatic
youth
a
radiant
girl
with
perhaps
a
third
a
broken
priest
the
rhythm
meanwhile
gained
upon
him
and
as
it
did
so
thinking
once
more
withdrew
and
feeling
stole
back
softly
his
being
became
more
harmonized
more
one
with
itself
more
open
to
inspiration
whose
work
was
service
service
everywhere
not
merely
in
that
tiny
corner
of
the
universe
called
humanity
who
could
neither
age
nor
die
what
was
the
hidden
link
that
bound
them
had
they
not
served
and
played
together
in
some
lost
caucasian
valley
leaped
with
the
sun
hot
fire
flown
in
the
winds
of
dawn
sung
laughed
and
danced
at
their
service
with
a
radiant
girl
who
had
at
last
enticed
them
into
the
confinement
of
a
limited
human
form
did
not
that
valley
symbolize
indeed
another
state
of
existence
another
order
of
consciousness
altogether
that
lay
beyond
any
known
present
experience
or
description
the
dawn
meanwhile
grew
nearer
and
a
pallid
light
ran
down
the
dreadful
streets
he
reached
at
length
the
foot
of
the
hill
upon
whose
shoulder
his
own
house
stood
the
familiar
sights
stirred
more
familiar
currents
of
feeling
and
these
in
turn
sought
words
the
crowding
houses
with
their
windows
followed
and
pressed
after
as
he
climbed
they
swarmed
behind
him
how
choked
and
airless
it
all
was
he
thought
of
the
routine
of
the
thousands
who
occupied
these
pretentious
buildings
here
lived
a
section
of
the
greatest
city
on
the
planet
almost
a
separate
little
town
with
marked
characteristics
atmosphere
tastes
and
habits
how
many
he
wondered
behind
those
walls
knew
yearning
belief
imagination
beyond
the
ruck
and
routine
of
familiar
narrow
thought
rows
upon
rows
with
their
stunted
manufactured
trees
hideous
conservatories
bulging
porches
ornamented
windows
his
wings
beat
against
them
all
with
the
burning
desire
to
set
their
inmates
free
they
caged
themselves
in
deliberately
a
few
thousand
years
ago
these
people
lived
in
mud
huts
before
that
in
caves
before
that
again
in
trees
now
they
were
civilized
they
dwelt
in
these
cages
oh
that
he
might
tear
away
the
thick
dead
bricks
and
let
in
light
and
dew
and
stars
and
the
brave
free
winds
of
heaven
waken
the
deeper
powers
they
carried
unwittingly
about
with
them
through
all
their
tedious
sufferings
teach
them
that
they
were
greater
than
they
knew
the
yearning
was
deep
and
true
in
him
as
the
houses
followed
and
tried
to
bar
his
way
many
of
the
occupiers
he
knew
would
welcome
help
would
gaze
with
happy
astonished
eyes
at
the
wonder
of
their
own
greater
selves
set
free
not
all
of
course
were
wingless
yet
the
majority
he
felt
were
otherwise
they
peered
at
him
from
behind
thick
curtains
hostile
sceptical
contented
with
their
lot
averse
to
change
mode
custom
habit
chained
them
to
the
floor
he
was
aware
of
a
collective
obstinate
grin
of
smug
complacency
of
dull
resistance
though
a
part
of
the
community
of
the
race
of
the
world
of
the
universe
itself
they
denied
their
mighty
brotherhood
and
clung
tenaciously
to
their
idea
of
living
apart
cut
off
and
separate
they
belonged
to
leagues
societies
clubs
and
circles
but
the
bigger
oneness
of
the
race
they
did
not
know
of
greater
powers
in
themselves
they
had
no
faintest
inkling
at
the
first
sign
of
these
they
would
shuffle
sneer
and
turn
away
grow
frightened
even
the
yearning
to
show
them
a
bigger
field
of
consciousness
to
help
them
towards
a
realization
of
their
buried
powers
to
let
them
out
of
their
separate
cages
beat
through
his
being
with
a
passionate
sincerity
in
a
hundred
thousand
years
perhaps
perhaps
in
a
million
he
knew
the
slow
gait
that
nature
loved
the
trend
of
an
age
is
not
to
be
stemmed
by
one
man
nor
by
twelve
who
see
over
the
horizon
the
futility
of
trying
pained
him
yet
if
no
one
ever
tried
oh
for
a
few
swift
strokes
of
awful
sacrifice
then
freedom
the
words
came
back
to
him
and
with
them
from
the
same
source
came
others
i
sit
and
i
weave
i
sit
and
i
whose
then
was
this
divine
eternal
patience
there
could
be
it
seemed
no
hurried
growth
no
instant
escape
no
sudden
leap
to
heaven
slowly
slowly
the
ages
turned
the
wheel
nor
can
other
beings
help
he
remembered
they
can
only
tell
what
their
own
part
and
as
his
clear
mind
saw
the
present
civilization
like
all
its
wonderful
predecessors
tottering
before
his
very
eyes
threatening
in
its
collapse
the
extinction
of
knowledge
so
slowly
painfully
laboriously
acquired
the
deep
heart
in
him
rose
as
on
wings
of
wind
and
fire
questing
the
stars
above
there
was
this
strange
clash
in
him
as
though
two
great
divisions
in
his
being
struggled
a
way
of
escape
seemed
just
within
his
reach
only
a
little
beyond
the
horizon
of
his
actual
knowledge
it
fluttered
marvellously
golden
alight
inviting
its
coming
glory
brushed
his
insight
it
was
simple
it
was
divine
there
seemed
a
faint
knocking
against
the
doors
of
his
mental
and
spiritual
understanding
he
cried
bright
messenger
he
paused
a
moment
and
stood
still
a
new
sound
lay
suddenly
in
the
night
it
came
apparently
from
far
away
almost
from
the
air
above
him
he
listened
no
after
all
it
was
only
steps
they
came
nearer
a
pedestrian
muffled
to
the
ears
went
past
and
the
steps
died
away
on
the
resounding
pavement
round
the
corner
yet
the
sound
continued
and
was
not
the
echo
of
the
steps
just
gone
it
was
moreover
he
now
felt
convinced
in
the
air
above
him
it
was
continuous
it
reminded
him
of
the
musical
droning
hum
that
a
big
bell
leaves
behind
it
while
a
suggestion
of
rhythm
almost
of
melody
ran
faintly
through
it
too
somebody
lines
was
it
shelley
ran
faintly
in
his
mind
yet
it
was
not
his
mind
now
that
surged
and
rose
to
the
new
great
rhythm
is
the
deep
music
of
the
rolling
world
kindling
within
the
strings
of
the
waved
air
æolian
modulations
clear
icy
keen
awakening
tones
that
pierce
the
sense
and
live
within
the
soul
he
listened
it
was
a
simple
natural
happy
sound
simple
as
running
water
natural
as
wind
happy
as
the
song
of
birds
chapter
xx
he
became
again
vividly
aware
of
the
power
and
presence
of
he
was
not
far
from
his
house
now
on
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
he
turned
his
eyes
upwards
where
the
moon
sailed
above
transparent
cirrus
clouds
that
scarcely
dimmed
her
light
like
dappled
sands
of
silver
they
sifted
her
soft
shining
moving
slowly
across
the
heavens
before
an
upper
wind
the
sound
continued
for
a
moment
or
two
in
the
pale
light
of
dawn
he
watched
and
listened
then
lowered
his
gaze
caught
his
breath
sharply
and
stood
stock
still
he
stared
in
front
of
him
next
turning
slowly
he
stared
right
and
left
he
stared
behind
as
well
yes
it
was
true
the
lines
and
rows
of
crowding
houses
trembled
disappeared
the
heavy
buildings
dissolved
before
his
very
eyes
the
solid
walls
and
roofs
were
gone
the
chimneys
railings
doors
and
porches
vanished
there
were
no
more
conservatories
there
were
no
the
streets
themselves
had
melted
he
gazed
in
amazement
and
delight
the
entire
hill
lay
bare
and
open
to
the
sky
across
the
rising
upland
swept
a
keen
fresh
morning
wind
yet
bare
they
were
not
this
rising
upland
and
this
hill
as
far
as
he
could
see
the
landscape
flowed
in
flowers
whose
fragrance
lay
upon
the
air
dew
trembled
shimmering
on
a
million
petals
of
blue
and
gold
of
orange
purple
violet
the
very
atmosphere
seemed
painted
flowering
trees
both
singly
and
in
groves
waved
in
the
breeze
birds
sang
in
chorus
there
was
a
murmur
of
streams
and
falling
waters
yet
that
other
sound
rose
too
rose
from
the
entire
hill
and
all
upon
it
a
continuous
gentle
rhythm
as
though
he
felt
the
actual
scenery
poured
forth
its
being
in
spontaneous
natural
expression
of
sound
as
well
as
of
form
and
colour
it
was
the
simplest
happiest
music
he
had
ever
heard
unable
to
deal
with
the
rapture
of
delight
that
swept
upon
him
he
stood
stock
still
among
the
blossoms
to
his
waist
eyes
ears
and
nostrils
were
inadequate
to
report
a
beauty
which
simple
though
it
was
overbore
nerves
and
senses
accustomed
to
a
lesser
scale
horizons
indeed
had
lifted
the
joy
and
confidence
of
fuller
life
poured
in
his
own
being
grew
immense
stretched
widened
deepened
till
it
seemed
to
include
all
space
he
was
everywhere
or
rather
everything
was
happening
somewhere
in
him
all
at
once
in
place
of
the
heavy
suburb
lay
this
garden
of
primal
beauty
while
yet
in
a
sense
the
suburb
itself
remained
as
well
only
it
had
flowered
revealing
the
subconscious
soul
the
bricks
and
pavements
hid
its
potential
self
had
blossomed
into
loveliness
and
wonder
the
sound
drew
nearer
he
was
aware
of
movement
figures
were
approaching
they
were
coming
in
his
direction
coming
towards
him
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
nearer
and
nearer
concealed
by
the
forest
of
tall
flowers
he
watched
them
come
yet
as
presences
he
perceived
them
rather
than
as
figures
already
borrowing
power
from
them
as
sails
borrow
from
a
rising
wind
his
consciousness
expanded
marvellously
to
let
them
in
their
stature
was
conveyed
to
him
chiefly
at
first
by
the
fact
that
these
flowers
though
rising
to
his
own
waist
did
not
cover
the
feet
of
them
yet
that
the
flowers
in
the
immediate
line
of
their
advance
still
swayed
and
nodded
as
though
no
weight
had
lain
upon
their
brilliance
the
footsteps
were
of
wind
the
figures
light
as
air
they
shone
their
radiant
presences
lit
the
acres
their
own
atmosphere
too
came
with
them
as
though
the
landscape
moved
and
travelled
with
and
in
their
being
as
though
the
flowers
the
natural
beauty
emanated
from
them
the
landscape
their
atmosphere
they
created
brought
it
with
them
it
seemed
that
they
expressed
the
landscape
and
were
the
scenery
with
all
its
multitudinous
forms
they
approached
with
a
great
and
easy
speed
that
was
not
measurable
over
the
crest
of
the
living
sunlit
hill
they
poured
with
their
bulk
their
speed
their
majesty
their
sweet
brimming
joy
fillery
stood
motionless
watching
them
his
own
joy
touched
with
awed
confusion
till
wonder
and
worship
mastered
the
final
trace
of
fear
though
he
perceived
these
figures
first
as
they
topped
the
skyline
he
was
aware
that
great
space
also
stretched
behind
them
and
that
this
immense
perspective
was
in
some
way
appropriate
to
their
appearance
born
of
a
greater
space
than
his
mind
could
understand
they
flowed
towards
him
across
that
windy
crest
and
at
the
same
time
from
infinitely
far
beyond
it
above
the
continuous
humming
sound
he
heard
their
music
too
faint
but
mighty
filling
the
air
with
deep
vibrations
that
seemed
the
natural
expression
of
their
joyful
beings
each
figure
was
a
chord
yet
all
combining
in
a
single
harmony
that
had
volume
without
loudness
it
seemed
to
him
that
their
sound
and
colour
and
movement
wove
a
new
pattern
upon
space
a
new
outline
form
or
growth
perhaps
a
flower
a
tree
perhaps
a
planet
they
were
creative
they
expressed
themselves
naturally
in
a
million
forms
he
heard
he
saw
he
knew
no
other
words
to
use
but
the
hearing
was
rather
some
kind
of
intimate
possession
so
that
his
whole
being
filled
and
overbrimmed
and
the
sight
was
greater
than
the
customary
little
irritation
of
the
optic
nerve
it
involved
another
term
of
space
he
could
describe
the
sight
more
readily
than
the
hearing
the
apparent
contradiction
of
distance
and
proximity
of
vast
size
yet
intimacy
made
him
tremble
in
his
his
sight
at
any
rate
perceived
the
approaching
figures
all
round
all
over
all
at
once
as
they
poured
like
a
wave
across
the
hill
from
far
beyond
its
visible
crest
for
into
this
space
below
the
horizon
he
saw
as
well
though
normally
speaking
it
was
out
of
sight
nor
did
he
see
one
side
only
he
saw
the
backs
of
the
towering
forms
as
easily
as
the
portion
facing
him
he
saw
behind
them
it
was
not
as
with
ordinary
objects
refracting
light
the
back
and
underneath
and
further
edges
invisible
all
sides
were
visible
at
once
the
space
beyond
moreover
whence
the
mighty
outlines
issued
was
of
such
immensity
that
he
could
think
only
of
interstellar
regions
not
to
the
little
planet
then
did
these
magnificent
shapes
belong
they
were
of
the
universe
the
symbol
of
his
valley
he
knew
suddenly
belonged
here
too
silent
with
wonder
motionless
with
worship
he
watched
the
singing
flood
of
what
he
felt
to
be
immense
pour
past
him
the
procession
lasted
for
hours
yet
was
over
in
a
minute
flash
all
categories
his
mind
knew
hitherto
were
useless
the
faces
in
their
power
their
majesty
the
splendour
even
of
their
extent
were
both
appalling
yet
infinitely
tender
they
were
filled
with
stars
blue
distance
flowers
spirals
of
fire
space
and
air
interwoven
too
with
shining
geometrical
designs
whose
intricate
patterns
merged
in
a
central
harmony
they
brought
their
own
winds
with
them
yet
of
features
precisely
he
was
not
aware
each
face
was
rather
an
immense
expression
but
an
expression
that
was
permanent
and
could
not
change
these
were
immutable
eternal
faces
he
borrowed
from
human
terms
the
only
words
that
offered
while
aware
that
he
falsely
introduced
the
personal
into
that
which
was
essentially
impersonal
there
stole
over
him
a
strange
certainty
that
what
he
worshipped
was
the
grandeur
of
joyful
service
working
through
unalterable
law
the
great
compassion
of
some
untiring
service
that
was
deathless
he
stood
the
universe
face
to
face
with
its
elemental
builders
guardians
its
constructive
artizans
the
impersonal
angelic
powers
the
region
the
state
he
now
felt
convinced
to
which
belonged
and
whence
by
some
inexplicable
chance
he
had
come
to
occupy
a
human
body
and
the
sounds
the
flash
came
to
him
with
lightning
conviction
were
those
essential
rhythms
which
are
the
kernels
of
all
visible
manifested
forms
he
was
not
aware
that
he
was
moving
that
he
had
left
the
spot
where
he
had
stood
so
long
yet
for
a
single
second
only
and
had
now
reached
the
corner
of
a
street
again
the
flowers
were
gone
and
the
trees
and
groves
gone
with
them
no
waters
rippled
past
there
was
no
shining
hill
the
moon
the
stars
the
breaking
dawn
remained
but
he
saw
windows
walls
and
villas
once
again
while
his
feet
echoed
on
dead
stone
pavements
yet
the
figures
had
not
wholly
gone
before
a
house
where
he
now
paused
a
moment
the
towering
flowing
outlines
were
still
faintly
visible
their
singing
still
audible
their
shapes
still
gently
luminous
they
stood
grouped
about
an
open
window
of
the
second
story
in
the
front
garden
a
big
plane
tree
stirred
its
leafless
branches
the
tree
and
figures
interpenetrated
slowly
then
the
outlines
grew
dim
and
shadowy
indistinguishable
almost
from
the
objects
in
the
twilight
near
them
chimneys
walls
and
roofs
stole
in
upon
the
great
shapes
with
foreign
grosser
details
that
obscured
their
harmony
confused
their
proportion
as
with
two
sets
of
values
the
eye
refused
to
focus
both
at
once
a
roof
a
chimney
obtruded
while
sight
struggled
fluttered
then
ended
in
confusion
the
figures
faded
and
melted
out
they
merged
with
the
tree
the
reddening
sky
the
murky
air
close
to
the
house
which
a
street
lamp
made
visible
suddenly
they
were
lost
they
were
no
longer
there
but
the
rhythmical
sound
though
fainter
still
continued
and
fillery
looked
up
it
was
a
sound
he
realized
in
a
flash
evocative
and
summoning
type
called
to
type
brother
to
brother
across
the
universe
the
house
before
him
was
his
own
and
the
open
window
through
which
the
music
issued
was
the
bedroom
of
he
stood
transfixed
both
sides
of
his
complex
nature
operated
simultaneously
his
mind
worked
more
clearly
the
entire
history
of
the
case
in
that
upstairs
room
passed
through
it
he
was
a
doctor
but
his
speculative
emotional
aspect
the
dreamer
in
him
so
greatly
daring
all
that
poetic
transcendental
part
which
classed
him
he
well
knew
with
the
unstable
all
this
long
and
dangerously
repressed
worked
with
opposite
if
equal
pressure
from
the
subconscious
rose
violent
hands
as
of
wind
and
fire
lovely
fashioning
divine
tearing
away
the
lid
of
the
reasoning
that
confined
confused
them
to
disentangle
to
define
these
separate
functions
were
a
difficult
problem
even
for
the
most
competent
psychiatrist
creative
imaginative
powers
hitherto
merely
fumbling
half
denied
as
well
now
stretched
their
wings
and
soared
with
them
came
a
blinding
clarity
of
sight
that
enabled
him
to
focus
a
vast
field
of
detail
with
extraordinary
rapidity
horizons
had
lifted
perspective
deepened
and
lit
up
in
a
few
brief
seconds
before
his
front
door
opened
a
hundred
details
flashed
towards
a
focus
and
shone
concentrated
the
vision
of
course
the
figures
had
now
melted
into
the
night
had
no
objective
reality
suppressed
passion
had
created
them
forbidden
yearnings
had
passed
the
censor
and
dramatized
a
dream
set
aside
yet
never
explained
that
heredity
was
responsible
for
both
were
born
of
his
lost
radiant
valley
his
note
books
held
a
thousand
similar
cases
but
the
speculative
dreamer
flashed
coloured
lights
against
this
common
white
the
prism
blazed
from
the
spaces
came
these
radiant
figures
from
sirius
immense
and
splendid
sun
from
aldebaran
among
the
happy
hyades
from
awful
betelgeuse
whose
volume
fills
a
martian
orbit
their
dazzling
giant
grandeur
was
of
stellar
origin
yet
equally
they
came
from
the
dreadful
back
gardens
of
those
sordid
houses
nature
was
nature
everywhere
in
the
nebulæ
as
in
the
stifled
plane
tree
of
a
city
court
that
he
saw
them
as
figures
was
but
his
own
private
personal
interpretation
of
a
prophecy
the
whole
universe
announced
they
were
not
figures
necessarily
they
were
powers
and
was
of
their
kind
he
suddenly
remembered
the
small
troubled
earth
whereon
he
lived
a
neglected
corner
of
the
universe
that
was
in
distress
and
cried
frantically
for
help
alcyone
caught
it
in
her
golden
arms
perhaps
sirius
thundered
against
its
little
ears
he
found
his
latchkey
and
fumblingly
inserted
it
but
even
while
he
did
so
the
state
of
the
planet
at
the
moment
poured
into
his
mind
with
swift
concentrated
detail
he
remembered
the
wireless
excitement
of
the
instant
and
smiled
not
that
way
would
it
come
the
new
order
was
of
a
spiritual
kind
it
would
steal
into
men
hearts
not
splutter
along
the
waves
of
ether
as
the
dead
are
said
to
splutter
to
the
living
the
great
impulse
the
mighty
invitation
nature
sent
out
to
return
to
simple
natural
life
would
come
without
phenomena
from
he
remembered
relativity
that
space
is
local
space
and
time
not
separate
entities
he
understood
he
had
just
experienced
it
another
a
fourth
dimension
space
as
a
whole
was
annihilated
he
smiled
his
latchkey
turned
the
transmutation
of
metals
flashed
past
him
all
substance
one
his
latchkey
was
upside
down
he
turned
it
round
and
reinserted
it
and
the
results
of
advanced
psychology
rushed
at
him
as
though
the
sun
rushed
over
the
horizon
of
some
eastern
clime
covering
all
with
the
light
of
a
new
fair
dawn
in
a
few
seconds
this
accumulation
of
recent
knowledge
and
discovery
flooded
his
state
of
singular
receptiveness
as
thinker
and
as
poet
the
age
was
crumbling
civilization
passing
like
its
predecessors
the
little
planet
lay
certainly
in
distress
no
true
help
lay
within
it
its
reservoirs
were
empty
no
adequate
constructive
men
or
powers
were
anywhere
in
sight
it
was
exhausted
dying
unless
new
help
powers
from
a
new
an
inexhaustible
source
came
quickly
a
new
vehicle
for
their
expression
and
wonder
took
him
by
the
throat
as
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
with
its
familiar
grating
sound
and
the
door
without
actual
pressure
on
his
part
swung
open
paul
devonham
a
look
of
bright
terror
in
his
eyes
stood
on
the
threshold
the
expression
not
only
of
the
face
but
of
the
whole
person
he
had
seen
once
only
in
another
human
countenance
a
climber
who
had
slipped
by
his
very
side
and
dropped
backward
into
empty
space
the
look
of
helpless
bewilderment
as
hands
and
feet
lost
final
touch
with
solidity
the
air
of
terrible
yet
childlike
amazement
with
which
he
began
his
descent
of
a
thousand
feet
through
a
gulf
of
air
the
shock
marked
the
face
in
a
single
second
with
what
he
now
saw
in
his
colleague
eyes
only
with
devonham
fillery
felt
sure
of
his
diagnosis
the
lost
hold
was
mental
his
outward
control
however
was
admirable
devonham
voice
apart
from
a
certain
tenseness
in
it
was
quiet
enough
i
been
telephoning
everywhere
there
been
a
a
crisis
violence
but
the
other
shook
his
head
it
all
beyond
me
quite
he
said
with
a
wry
smile
the
first
outbreak
was
nothing
nothing
compared
to
this
the
continuous
sound
of
humming
which
filled
the
hall
making
the
air
vibrate
oddly
grew
louder
devonham
seized
his
friend
arm
listen
he
whispered
you
hear
that
i
heard
it
outside
in
the
street
fillery
said
what
is
it
devonham
glared
at
him
god
knows
he
said
i
do
he
been
doing
it
on
and
off
for
a
couple
of
hours
it
began
the
moment
you
left
it
seems
they
all
about
him
these
vibrations
i
mean
he
does
it
with
his
whole
body
somehow
and
he
hesitated
there
meaning
in
it
of
some
kind
results
i
mean
he
jerked
out
with
an
effort
visible
came
the
gentle
question
devonham
started
how
did
you
know
there
was
a
thrust
of
intense
curiosity
in
the
eyes
i
had
a
similar
experience
myself
paul
you
opened
the
front
door
in
the
middle
of
it
the
figures
you
saw
figures
devonham
looked
thunderstruck
in
his
heart
was
obviously
a
touch
of
panic
as
the
two
men
stood
gazing
into
each
other
eyes
a
moment
silently
the
sound
about
them
increased
again
rising
and
falling
its
great
separate
rhythmical
waves
almost
distinguishable
in
fillery
mind
rose
patterns
outlines
forms
of
flowers
spirals
circles
he
knows
you
in
the
house
said
devonham
in
a
curious
voice
relieved
apparently
no
answer
came
to
his
question
better
come
upstairs
at
once
and
see
him
but
he
did
not
turn
to
lead
the
way
that
not
auditory
hallucination
edward
whatever
else
it
is
he
was
still
clinging
to
the
rock
but
the
rock
was
crumbling
beneath
his
desperate
touch
space
yawned
below
him
visual
suggested
fillery
as
though
he
held
out
a
feeble
hand
to
the
man
whose
whole
weight
already
hung
unsupported
before
the
plunge
his
friend
spoke
no
word
but
his
expression
made
words
unnecessary
we
must
face
the
facts
it
said
plainly
wherever
these
may
lead
no
shirking
no
prejudice
of
mine
or
yours
must
interfere
there
must
be
no
faltering
now
so
plainly
was
his
passion
for
truth
and
knowledge
legible
in
the
expression
of
the
shocked
but
honest
mind
that
fillery
felt
compassion
overpower
the
first
attitude
of
privacy
he
had
meant
to
take
this
time
he
must
share
the
honesty
of
the
other
won
his
confidence
too
fully
for
him
to
hold
back
anything
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
he
read
his
colleague
state
aright
a
moment
paul
he
said
in
a
low
voice
before
we
go
upstairs
and
he
put
his
hand
out
oddly
enough
meeting
devonham
hand
already
stretched
to
meet
it
he
drew
him
aside
into
a
corner
of
the
hall
while
the
waves
of
sound
surged
round
and
over
them
like
a
sea
let
me
first
tell
you
he
went
on
his
voice
trembling
slightly
my
own
experience
it
seemed
to
him
that
any
moment
he
must
see
the
birth
of
a
new
form
an
outline
a
body
dance
across
before
his
very
eyes
neither
auditory
nor
visual
murmured
devonham
burning
to
hear
what
was
coming
yet
at
the
same
time
shrinking
from
it
by
the
laws
of
his
personality
hallucination
of
any
kind
there
is
absolutely
none
there
nothing
transferred
from
your
mind
to
his
this
thing
is
real
original
fillery
tightened
his
grip
a
second
on
the
hand
he
held
paul
he
said
gravely
yet
unable
to
hide
the
joy
of
recent
ecstasy
in
his
eyes
it
is
also
new
the
low
syllables
seemed
borne
away
and
lifted
beyond
their
reach
by
an
immense
vibration
that
swept
softly
past
them
and
so
actual
was
this
invisible
wave
that
behind
it
lay
the
trough
the
ebb
that
awaits
as
in
the
sea
the
next
advancing
crest
into
this
ebb
as
it
were
both
men
dropped
simultaneously
the
same
significant
syllables
their
lips
uttered
together
the
wave
of
sound
seemed
to
take
their
voices
and
increase
them
it
was
the
older
man
who
added
coming
into
full
possession
the
two
stood
waiting
listening
their
heads
turned
sideways
their
bodies
motionless
while
the
soft
rhythmical
uproar
rose
and
fell
about
them
no
sign
escaped
them
for
some
minutes
no
words
it
seemed
occurred
to
either
of
them
through
the
transom
over
the
front
door
stole
the
grey
light
of
the
late
autumn
dawn
the
hall
furniture
was
visible
chairs
wooden
chests
that
held
the
motor
rugs
a
china
bowl
filled
with
visiting
cards
gleamed
white
beside
it
soon
the
milkman
uttering
his
comic
earthly
cry
would
clatter
down
the
area
staircase
and
the
servants
would
be
up
as
yet
however
but
for
the
big
soft
sound
the
house
was
perfectly
still
this
part
of
it
almost
a
separate
wing
was
completely
cut
off
from
the
main
building
no
one
had
been
disturbed
fillery
moved
his
head
and
looked
at
his
companion
the
expression
of
both
face
and
figure
arrested
him
he
had
taken
off
his
dinner
jacket
and
the
old
loose
golfing
coat
he
wore
hung
askew
he
had
one
hand
in
a
pocket
of
it
the
other
thrust
deep
into
his
trousers
his
glasses
hung
down
across
his
crumpled
his
black
tie
made
an
untidy
cross
he
looked
thought
fillery
whose
sense
of
the
ludicrous
became
always
specially
alert
in
his
gravest
moments
like
an
unhappy
curate
who
had
presided
over
some
strenuous
and
worrying
social
gathering
in
the
local
town
hall
only
one
detail
denied
this
picture
the
expression
of
something
mysterious
and
awed
in
the
face
he
was
listening
with
sharp
dislike
yet
eager
interest
his
repugnance
betrayed
itself
in
the
tightened
lips
the
set
of
the
angular
shoulders
the
panic
was
written
in
the
glistening
eyes
there
were
things
in
his
face
he
could
never
never
tell
the
struggle
in
him
was
natural
to
his
type
of
mind
he
had
experienced
something
himself
and
a
personal
experience
opens
new
vistas
in
sympathy
and
understanding
but
the
experience
ran
contrary
to
every
tenet
of
theory
and
practice
he
had
ever
known
the
moment
of
new
birth
was
painful
this
was
his
colleague
diagnosis
fillery
then
suddenly
realized
that
the
gulf
between
them
was
without
a
bridge
to
tell
his
own
experience
became
at
once
utterly
impossible
he
saw
this
clearly
he
could
not
speak
of
it
to
his
assistant
it
was
after
all
incommunicable
the
bridge
of
terms
language
feeling
did
not
exist
between
them
and
again
up
flashed
for
a
second
his
sense
of
the
comic
this
time
in
an
odd
touch
of
memory
povey
favourite
sentence
never
argue
with
the
only
to
older
souls
was
expression
possible
for
the
first
time
then
his
diagnosis
wavered
oddly
why
for
instance
did
paul
persist
in
that
curious
watchful
stare
devonham
conscious
of
his
chief
eyes
and
mind
upon
him
looked
up
somewhere
in
his
expression
was
a
glare
but
nothing
revealed
his
state
of
mind
better
than
the
fact
that
he
stupidly
contradicted
himself
you
putting
all
this
into
him
edward
a
touch
of
anger
perhaps
of
fear
in
the
intense
whispering
voice
the
hysteria
of
the
studio
upset
him
of
course
if
you
left
him
alone
as
you
promised
have
always
stayed
levallon
he
be
cured
by
now
then
as
fillery
made
no
reply
or
comment
he
added
but
this
time
only
the
anxiety
of
the
doctor
in
his
tone
had
you
better
go
up
to
him
at
once
your
patient
not
mine
remember
the
other
took
his
arm
not
yet
he
said
quietly
he
best
alone
for
the
moment
he
smiled
and
it
was
the
smile
that
invariably
won
him
the
confidence
of
even
the
most
obstinate
and
difficult
patient
he
was
completely
master
of
himself
again
besides
paul
he
went
on
gently
i
want
to
hear
what
you
have
to
tell
me
some
of
it
if
not
all
i
want
your
report
it
is
of
value
i
must
have
that
first
you
know
they
sat
on
the
bottom
stair
together
while
devonham
told
briefly
what
had
happened
he
was
glad
to
tell
it
too
it
was
a
relief
to
become
the
mere
accurate
observer
again
i
can
summarize
it
for
you
in
two
words
he
said
light
and
sound
the
sound
at
first
seemed
wind
wind
rising
wind
outside
with
the
light
was
perceptible
heat
the
two
seemed
correlated
when
the
sound
increased
the
heat
increased
too
then
the
sound
became
methodical
rhythmical
it
became
almost
musical
as
it
did
so
the
light
became
coloured
both
he
looked
across
at
the
ghostly
in
the
hall
were
produced
by
him
items
please
paul
i
want
an
itemized
account
devonham
fumbled
in
the
big
pockets
of
his
coat
and
eventually
lit
a
cigarette
though
he
did
not
in
the
least
want
to
smoke
that
watchful
penetrating
stare
persisted
none
the
less
amid
the
anxiety
were
items
of
carelessness
that
almost
seemed
assumed
soames
sent
nurse
robbins
to
fetch
me
he
resumed
his
voice
harshly
as
it
seemed
cutting
across
the
waves
of
pleasant
sound
that
poured
down
the
empty
stairs
behind
them
and
filled
the
hall
with
resonant
vibrations
i
went
in
turned
them
both
out
and
closed
the
door
the
room
was
filled
with
a
soft
white
light
rather
pale
in
tint
that
seemed
to
emanate
from
nowhere
i
could
trace
it
to
no
source
it
was
equally
diffused
i
mean
yet
a
kind
of
vibration
ran
through
it
in
faint
curves
and
circles
there
was
a
sound
a
sound
like
wind
a
wind
was
in
the
room
moaning
and
sighing
inside
the
walls
a
perfectly
natural
and
ordinary
sound
if
it
had
been
outside
the
light
moved
and
quivered
it
lay
in
sheets
its
movement
i
noticed
was
in
direct
relation
to
the
wind
the
louder
the
volume
of
sound
the
greater
the
movement
of
the
air
the
brighter
became
the
light
and
vice
versa
i
could
not
take
notes
at
the
actual
moment
but
my
memory
a
slight
grimace
by
way
of
a
smile
indicated
that
forgetting
was
impossible
is
accurate
as
you
know
fillery
did
not
interrupt
either
by
word
or
gesture
the
increase
of
light
was
accompanied
by
colour
and
the
increase
of
sound
led
into
a
measure
not
actual
bars
and
never
melody
but
a
distinct
measure
that
involved
rhythm
it
was
musical
as
i
said
the
colour
i
coming
to
that
then
took
on
a
very
faint
tinge
of
gold
or
orange
a
little
red
in
it
sometimes
flame
colour
almost
the
air
was
luminous
it
was
radiant
at
one
time
i
half
expected
to
see
fire
for
there
was
heat
as
well
not
an
unpleasant
heat
but
a
comforting
stimulating
agreeable
heat
like
i
was
going
to
say
like
the
heat
of
a
bright
coal
fire
on
a
winter
day
but
i
think
the
better
term
is
sunlight
i
had
an
impression
this
heat
must
burst
presently
into
actual
flame
it
never
did
so
the
sheets
of
coloured
light
rose
and
fell
with
the
volume
of
the
sound
there
were
curves
and
waves
and
rising
columns
like
spirals
but
anything
approaching
a
definite
outline
form
or
shape
he
broke
off
for
a
second
figures
he
announced
abruptly
almost
challengingly
staring
at
the
white
china
bowl
in
front
of
him
i
could
swear
to
he
turned
suddenly
and
stared
at
his
chief
with
an
expression
half
of
question
half
of
challenge
then
seemed
to
change
his
mind
shrugging
his
shoulders
a
very
little
but
fillery
made
no
sign
he
did
not
answer
he
laid
one
hand
however
upon
the
banisters
as
though
preliminary
to
getting
to
his
feet
the
sound
about
them
had
been
gradually
growing
less
the
vibrations
were
smaller
its
waves
perceptibly
decreasing
devonham
finished
his
account
in
a
lower
voice
speaking
rapidly
as
though
the
words
burnt
his
tongue
the
sound
i
had
already
discovered
issued
from
himself
he
was
lying
on
his
back
the
eyes
wide
open
the
expression
peaceful
even
happy
the
lips
were
closed
he
was
humming
continuously
humming
yet
the
sound
came
in
some
way
i
can
not
describe
and
could
not
examine
or
ascertain
from
his
whole
body
i
detected
no
vibration
of
the
body
it
lay
half
naked
only
a
corner
of
the
sheet
upon
it
it
lay
quite
still
the
cause
of
the
light
and
heat
the
cause
of
the
movement
of
air
i
have
called
wind
i
could
not
ascertain
they
came
him
as
it
were
a
slight
shiver
ran
across
his
body
noticed
by
his
companion
but
eliciting
no
comment
from
him
i
i
took
his
pulse
concluded
devonham
sinking
his
voice
now
to
a
whisper
though
a
very
clear
one
it
was
very
rapid
and
extraordinarily
strong
he
seemed
entirely
unconscious
of
my
presence
i
also
again
the
faint
shiver
was
perceptible
felt
his
heart
it
was
i
have
never
felt
such
perfect
action
such
power
it
was
beating
like
an
engine
like
an
engine
and
the
sense
of
vitality
of
life
in
the
room
everywhere
was
electrical
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
packed
to
the
walls
with
with
others
devonham
never
ceased
to
watch
his
companion
keenly
while
he
spoke
fillery
then
put
his
first
question
and
the
effect
upon
yourself
he
asked
quietly
i
mean
any
emotional
disturbance
anything
for
instance
like
what
you
in
the
jura
forests
he
did
not
look
at
his
colleague
he
stood
up
the
sound
about
them
had
now
ceased
almost
entirely
and
only
faint
dying
fragments
of
it
reached
them
roughly
speaking
he
added
making
a
half
movement
to
go
upstairs
he
understood
the
inner
struggle
going
on
he
wished
to
make
it
easy
for
him
for
the
complete
account
he
did
not
press
him
devonham
rose
too
he
walked
over
to
the
china
bowl
took
up
a
card
read
it
and
let
it
fall
again
the
sun
was
over
the
horizon
now
and
a
pallid
light
showed
objects
clearly
it
showed
the
whiteness
of
the
thin
tired
face
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
back
across
the
hall
the
first
cart
went
clattering
noisily
down
the
street
at
the
same
moment
a
final
sound
from
the
room
upstairs
came
floating
down
into
the
chill
early
air
my
interest
of
course
began
devonham
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
body
rigid
as
he
looked
up
into
his
companion
eyes
was
very
concentrated
my
mind
intensely
active
he
paused
then
added
cautiously
i
may
confess
however
i
must
admit
that
is
a
certain
increase
of
of
well
a
general
sense
of
let
me
call
it
the
heat
you
see
a
feeling
of
peace
if
you
like
it
better
beyond
the
fear
he
blurted
out
finally
changing
his
hands
from
his
coat
to
his
trouser
pockets
as
though
the
new
position
protected
him
better
from
attack
also
i
somehow
expected
any
moment
to
see
outlines
forms
something
new
he
stared
frankly
into
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
from
the
step
above
him
returned
his
gaze
with
equal
frankness
and
edward
he
asked
with
great
suddenness
joy
could
you
describe
it
as
joy
his
companion
ignored
the
reference
to
new
forms
he
also
ignored
the
sudden
question
any
increase
of
vitality
you
want
to
say
the
word
joy
is
meaningless
as
you
know
an
intensification
of
consciousness
in
any
way
but
devonham
had
reached
his
limit
of
possible
confession
he
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
he
took
a
step
forward
and
stood
beside
fillery
on
the
stairs
his
manner
had
abruptly
changed
it
was
as
though
he
had
come
to
a
conclusion
suddenly
his
reply
when
it
came
was
no
reply
at
all
heat
and
light
are
favourable
of
course
to
life
he
remarked
you
remember
joaquin
mueller
optic
nerve
under
the
action
of
light
acts
as
a
stimulus
to
the
organs
of
the
imagination
and
fancy
fillery
smiled
as
he
took
his
arm
and
they
went
quietly
upstairs
together
the
quoting
was
a
sign
of
returning
confidence
he
said
something
to
himself
about
the
absence
of
light
but
so
low
it
was
under
his
breath
almost
and
even
if
his
companion
heard
it
he
made
no
comment
there
was
no
moon
at
all
till
well
past
three
and
even
then
her
light
was
of
the
faintest
no
sound
was
now
audible
they
entered
a
room
that
was
filled
with
silence
and
with
peace
a
faint
ray
of
morning
sunlight
showed
the
form
of
the
patient
sleeping
calmly
the
body
entirely
uncovered
there
was
an
expression
of
quiet
happiness
upon
the
face
whose
perfect
health
suggested
perhaps
radiance
but
there
was
a
change
as
well
though
indescribable
there
was
power
he
did
not
stir
as
they
approached
the
bed
the
breathing
was
regular
and
very
deep
standing
beside
him
a
moment
fillery
sniffed
the
air
then
smiled
there
was
a
perfume
of
wild
flowers
there
was
in
spite
of
the
cool
morning
air
a
pleasant
warmth
you
notice
anything
he
whispered
turning
to
his
colleague
devonham
likewise
sniffed
the
air
the
window
wide
open
was
the
low
rejoinder
there
are
conservatories
at
the
back
of
every
house
all
down
the
row
and
they
left
the
room
on
tiptoe
closing
the
door
behind
them
very
softly
upon
devonham
face
lay
a
curious
expression
half
anxiety
half
pain
chapter
xxi
fillery
lying
on
a
couch
in
his
patient
bedroom
snatched
some
four
to
five
hours
sleep
though
if
snatched
it
was
certainly
enjoyed
a
deep
dreamless
reposeful
slumber
he
woke
refreshed
in
mind
and
body
and
the
first
thing
he
saw
even
before
he
had
time
to
stretch
a
limb
or
move
his
head
was
two
great
blue
eyes
gazing
into
his
own
across
the
room
they
belonged
it
first
struck
him
to
some
strange
being
that
had
followed
him
out
of
sleep
he
had
not
yet
recovered
full
consciousness
and
the
effects
of
sleep
still
hovered
then
an
earlier
phrase
recurred
to
some
divine
great
animal
in
his
bed
in
the
opposite
corner
lay
gazing
at
him
he
returned
the
gaze
into
the
blue
eyes
came
at
once
a
look
of
happy
recognition
of
contentment
almost
a
smile
then
they
closed
again
in
sleep
the
room
was
full
of
morning
sunshine
fillery
rose
quietly
and
performed
his
toilet
in
his
own
quarters
but
on
returning
after
a
hurried
breakfast
the
patient
still
slept
soundly
he
slept
on
for
hours
he
slept
the
morning
through
but
for
the
obvious
evidences
of
perfect
normal
health
it
might
have
been
a
state
of
coma
the
body
did
not
even
change
its
position
once
he
left
devonham
in
charge
and
was
on
his
way
to
visit
some
of
the
other
cases
when
nurse
robbins
stood
before
him
miss
khilkoff
had
called
to
inquire
after
levallon
and
was
waiting
downstairs
in
case
fillery
could
also
see
her
he
glanced
at
her
pretty
slim
figure
and
delicate
complexion
her
hair
fine
plentiful
and
shiny
her
dark
eyes
with
a
twinkle
in
them
she
was
an
attractive
intelligent
experienced
young
woman
tactful
too
and
of
great
use
with
extra
sensitive
patients
she
was
of
course
already
hopelessly
in
love
with
her
present
case
his
singing
so
she
called
it
to
soames
had
excited
her
like
a
glass
of
wine
some
music
makes
you
feel
like
that
so
that
you
could
love
everybody
in
the
world
she
already
called
him
master
please
say
i
will
be
down
at
once
said
fillery
watching
her
for
the
first
time
with
interest
as
he
remembered
these
details
paul
had
told
him
the
girl
it
now
struck
him
was
intensely
alive
there
was
a
gain
an
increase
in
her
appearance
somewhere
he
recalled
also
the
matron
remark
she
was
not
usually
loquacious
with
her
nurses
that
he
no
ordinary
case
and
i
seen
a
good
few
have
i
the
way
he
understands
animals
and
flowers
alone
proves
that
fillery
went
downstairs
his
first
rapid
survey
of
the
girl
exhaustive
for
all
its
quickness
he
knew
her
so
well
showed
him
that
no
outward
signs
of
excitement
were
visible
calm
poised
gentle
as
ever
the
same
generous
tenderness
in
the
eyes
the
same
sweet
firmness
in
the
mouth
the
familiar
steadiness
that
was
the
result
of
an
inner
surety
all
were
there
as
though
the
wild
scene
of
the
night
before
had
never
been
yet
all
those
were
heightened
her
beauty
had
curiously
increased
come
into
my
study
he
said
taking
her
hand
and
leading
the
way
we
sha
be
disturbed
there
besides
it
ours
is
it
we
forget
that
you
are
a
member
of
the
firm
he
was
aware
of
her
soft
beauty
invading
penetrating
him
aware
too
somehow
that
she
was
in
her
most
impersonal
mood
but
for
all
that
her
nature
could
not
hide
itself
nor
could
signs
of
a
certain
subtle
change
she
had
undergone
fail
to
obtrude
themselves
in
a
single
night
it
seemed
she
had
blossomed
into
a
wondrous
ripe
maturity
like
some
strange
flower
that
opens
to
the
darkness
the
bud
had
burst
suddenly
into
full
sweet
bloom
whose
coming
only
moon
and
stars
had
witnessed
there
was
moonlight
now
in
her
dark
mysterious
eyes
as
she
glanced
at
him
there
was
the
gold
of
stars
in
her
tender
yet
curious
smile
as
she
answered
in
her
low
voice
of
course
i
always
a
partner
in
the
firm
there
was
the
grace
and
rhythm
of
a
wild
flower
swaying
in
the
wind
as
she
passed
before
him
into
the
quiet
room
and
sank
into
his
own
swinging
armchair
at
the
desk
but
there
was
something
else
as
well
a
detail
of
his
recent
vision
slid
past
his
inner
sight
again
while
he
watched
her
i
thought
i
felt
sure
you
would
come
he
said
he
looked
at
her
admiringly
but
peace
strong
in
his
heart
the
ordeal
he
went
on
in
a
curious
voice
would
have
been
too
much
for
most
women
but
you
he
smiled
and
the
sympathy
in
his
voice
increased
you
i
see
have
only
gained
from
it
you
mastered
conquered
it
i
wonder
looking
away
from
her
almost
as
if
speaking
to
himself
have
you
wholly
understood
it
he
realized
vividly
in
that
moment
what
she
as
a
young
unmarried
girl
had
suffered
before
the
eyes
of
all
those
prying
eyes
and
gossiping
tongues
his
admiration
deepened
she
did
not
take
up
his
words
however
i
come
to
inquire
she
said
simply
in
an
even
voice
for
father
and
myself
he
wanted
to
know
if
you
got
home
all
right
and
how
julian
levallon
is
the
tone
the
heightened
colour
in
the
cheek
as
she
spoke
the
name
no
one
had
yet
used
explained
partly
at
least
to
the
experienced
man
who
listened
the
secret
of
her
sudden
blossoming
also
she
used
her
father
though
unconsciously
perhaps
he
was
afraid
the
electricity
the
lightning
even
had
she
hesitated
smiled
a
little
then
added
as
though
she
herself
knew
otherwise
done
something
to
him
fillery
laughed
with
her
then
as
it
has
done
to
you
he
thought
but
did
not
speak
the
words
the
need
of
formula
was
past
he
thanked
her
adding
that
it
was
sweet
yet
right
that
she
had
come
herself
instead
of
writing
or
telephoning
and
you
may
set
your
your
father
mind
at
rest
for
all
goes
well
the
electricity
of
course
he
added
on
his
own
behalf
as
well
as
hers
was
more
than
most
of
us
could
manage
electricity
explains
everything
except
itself
does
it
he
was
inwardly
examining
her
with
an
intense
and
accurate
observation
she
seemed
the
same
yet
different
the
sudden
flowering
into
beauty
was
simply
enough
explained
it
was
another
change
he
now
became
more
and
more
aware
of
in
this
way
a
ship
grown
familiar
during
the
long
voyage
changes
on
coming
into
port
the
decks
and
staircases
look
different
when
the
vessel
lies
motionless
at
the
dock
it
becomes
half
recognizable
half
strange
gone
is
the
old
familiarity
gone
also
one
own
former
angle
of
vision
it
is
difficult
to
find
one
way
about
her
soon
she
will
set
sail
again
but
in
another
direction
and
with
new
passengers
using
her
decks
her
corners
hatchways
telling
their
secrets
of
love
and
hate
with
that
recklessness
the
open
sea
and
sky
make
easy
and
now
with
the
girl
before
him
he
could
quite
find
his
way
about
her
as
of
old
it
was
the
same
familiar
ship
yet
it
was
otherwise
and
he
a
new
passenger
acknowledged
the
freedom
of
sea
and
sky
and
you
iraida
he
asked
it
was
brave
of
you
to
come
she
liked
evidently
the
use
of
her
real
name
for
she
smiled
aware
all
the
time
of
his
intent
observation
aware
probably
also
of
his
hidden
pain
yet
no
sign
of
awkwardness
in
her
to
this
man
she
could
talk
openly
or
on
the
contrary
conceal
her
thoughts
sure
of
his
tact
and
judgment
he
would
never
intrude
unwisely
it
was
natural
edward
she
observed
frankly
in
return
yes
i
suppose
it
was
natural
is
exactly
the
right
word
you
have
perhaps
found
yourself
at
last
and
again
he
used
her
real
name
iraida
it
feels
like
that
she
replied
slowly
she
paused
i
have
found
at
least
something
definite
that
i
have
to
do
i
feel
that
i
must
care
for
him
her
eyes
as
she
said
it
were
untroubled
the
nayan
flashed
back
a
moment
in
the
words
he
recognized
to
use
his
simile
a
familiar
corner
of
the
deck
where
he
had
sat
and
talked
for
hours
beneath
the
quiet
stars
to
someone
who
understood
yet
remained
ever
impersonal
and
the
person
he
talked
with
came
over
suddenly
and
stood
beside
him
and
took
his
hand
between
her
own
soft
gloved
ones
you
told
me
edward
he
would
need
a
woman
to
help
him
that
what
you
mean
by
is
it
and
i
am
she
perhaps
i
think
you
are
came
in
a
level
tone
i
know
it
she
said
suddenly
both
her
eyes
looking
down
upon
his
face
yes
i
suppose
i
know
it
because
need
him
his
voice
equally
secure
made
answer
still
keeping
his
hand
tight
between
her
own
her
dark
eyes
still
searching
his
she
made
no
sign
that
his
blunt
statement
was
accepted
much
less
admitted
instead
she
asked
a
question
he
was
not
prepared
for
you
would
like
that
edward
you
wish
it
she
was
so
close
against
his
chair
that
her
coat
brushed
his
shoulder
yet
though
with
eyes
and
touch
and
physical
presence
she
was
so
near
he
felt
that
she
herself
had
gone
far
far
away
into
some
other
place
he
drew
his
hand
free
iraida
he
said
quietly
i
wish
the
best
for
him
and
for
you
and
i
believe
this
is
the
best
for
him
and
you
he
put
his
patient
first
he
was
aware
that
the
girl
for
all
her
outer
calmness
trembled
it
is
she
said
her
voice
as
quiet
as
his
own
and
after
a
hesitation
she
went
back
to
her
seat
again
if
you
think
i
can
be
of
use
she
added
i
ready
a
little
pause
fell
between
them
during
which
fillery
touched
an
electric
bell
beside
his
chair
nurse
robbins
appeared
with
what
seemed
miraculous
swiftness
still
sleeping
quietly
sir
and
pulse
normal
again
she
replied
in
answer
to
a
question
then
vanished
as
suddenly
as
she
had
come
he
looked
into
the
girl
eyes
across
the
room
a
competent
reliable
nurse
he
remarked
and
as
you
saw
a
pretty
woman
he
glanced
out
of
the
window
she
is
unmarried
he
mentioned
it
apparently
to
the
sky
the
quick
mind
took
in
his
meaning
instantly
all
women
will
be
drawn
to
him
irresistibly
of
course
she
said
but
it
is
not
no
no
of
course
it
is
not
that
he
agreed
at
once
i
should
like
you
to
see
him
though
not
however
just
yet
he
went
on
after
a
moment
reflection
and
speaking
slowly
i
should
like
you
to
wait
a
little
it
best
there
been
a
a
certain
disturbance
in
his
being
it
his
first
experience
she
began
of
beauty
of
beauty
in
women
yes
he
finished
for
her
it
is
we
must
avoid
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
violent
shock
he
has
asked
for
me
she
interrupted
again
in
her
quiet
way
he
shook
his
head
and
we
can
not
be
sure
that
it
was
you
as
he
sought
and
is
affected
by
the
call
he
hears
is
perhaps
hardly
the
call
that
sounds
in
most
men
ears
i
mean
the
hint
of
warning
guidance
was
audible
in
his
voice
as
well
as
visible
in
his
eyes
and
manner
the
laughter
they
both
betrayed
a
grave
and
curious
laughter
perhaps
was
brief
yet
enough
to
conceal
stranger
emotions
that
rose
like
dumb
gazing
figures
almost
before
their
eyes
yet
if
she
knew
inner
turmoil
emotion
of
any
troubling
sort
she
concealed
it
perfectly
i
am
glad
the
girl
said
presently
oh
i
am
really
glad
i
think
i
understand
edward
and
even
while
he
sat
silent
for
a
bit
watching
her
with
an
admiration
that
at
the
same
time
marvelled
he
saw
the
wonder
of
great
questions
riding
through
her
face
the
recollection
of
what
she
had
suffered
publicly
in
the
studio
a
few
hours
before
came
into
his
mind
again
in
these
questions
perhaps
lay
the
only
signs
of
the
hidden
storm
below
the
surface
are
there
are
there
such
things
as
edward
she
asked
abruptly
we
know
this
is
his
first
experience
are
there
then
he
was
prepared
a
little
for
this
kind
of
question
by
her
eyes
we
have
no
evidence
of
course
he
replied
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
for
anything
of
the
sort
there
are
people
however
so
close
to
nature
so
intimate
with
her
that
we
may
say
they
are
strangely
inexplicably
akin
has
he
a
soul
a
human
soul
like
ours
she
asked
point
blank
he
is
perhaps
not
quite
like
us
that
may
be
your
task
iraida
he
added
enigmatically
he
watched
her
more
closely
than
she
knew
she
appeared
to
ponder
his
words
for
a
few
minutes
then
she
asked
abruptly
and
when
do
you
think
i
ought
to
come
and
see
him
you
will
let
me
know
i
will
let
you
know
a
few
days
perhaps
perhaps
a
week
perhaps
longer
some
education
i
think
is
necessary
first
he
gazed
at
her
thoughtfully
and
she
returned
his
look
her
dark
eyes
filled
with
the
wonder
that
was
both
of
a
child
and
of
a
woman
and
yet
with
a
security
of
something
that
was
of
neither
it
will
be
a
a
great
effort
to
you
he
ventured
with
significant
and
sympathetic
understanding
after
what
happened
it
is
brave
and
generous
of
you
he
broke
off
she
nodded
but
at
once
afterwards
shook
her
head
she
rose
then
to
go
but
fillery
stopped
her
he
rose
too
nayan
i
now
want
help
he
said
with
more
emotion
than
he
had
yet
shown
my
responsibility
as
you
may
guess
is
not
light
and
and
he
is
in
your
sole
charge
you
mean
she
had
willingly
resumed
her
seat
and
made
herself
comfortable
with
a
cushion
he
arranged
for
her
he
was
aware
chiefly
of
her
eyes
for
in
them
glowed
light
and
fire
he
had
never
seen
there
before
but
still
in
their
depths
well
yes
partly
he
replied
lighting
a
cigarette
though
paul
is
ready
with
help
and
sympathy
whenever
needed
but
the
charge
as
you
call
it
is
not
mine
alone
it
is
ours
ours
she
started
though
almost
imperceptibly
as
she
repeated
his
word
subconsciously
he
said
in
a
firm
voice
we
three
are
similar
we
are
together
we
obey
half
instinctively
the
unknown
laws
of
he
hesitated
a
moment
of
some
unknown
state
of
being
he
added
then
a
singular
sentence
though
so
low
it
seemed
almost
to
himself
had
we
been
man
and
wife
iraida
our
child
must
have
been
like
him
yes
she
said
leaning
forward
a
little
in
her
chair
increased
warmth
yet
no
blush
upon
her
skin
yes
edward
we
three
are
somehow
together
in
this
are
we
oh
i
feel
it
it
pours
over
me
like
a
great
wind
a
wind
with
heat
in
it
her
hands
clasped
her
knee
as
they
gazed
at
one
another
for
a
moment
silence
i
feel
it
she
repeated
presently
i
sure
of
it
quite
sure
she
stretched
out
a
spirit
hand
as
it
were
for
an
instant
across
the
impersonal
barrier
between
them
but
he
did
not
take
it
pretending
he
did
not
see
it
ours
nayan
he
emphasized
again
using
the
name
that
belonged
to
everyone
therefore
you
see
i
want
you
to
tell
me
if
you
will
what
you
felt
experienced
perceived
in
the
studio
last
night
after
watching
her
a
little
he
qualified
another
day
if
you
would
like
to
think
it
over
but
some
time
without
fail
for
my
part
i
will
confess
though
i
think
you
already
know
it
that
i
brought
him
there
on
purpose
to
see
my
effect
upon
him
edward
but
in
interest
and
in
the
interest
of
my
possible
future
treatment
his
effect
upon
yourself
was
not
my
motive
you
believe
that
i
know
i
know
and
i
will
tell
you
gladly
indeed
i
want
to
he
was
aware
as
she
said
it
that
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
her
to
talk
she
would
welcome
the
relief
of
confession
she
could
speak
to
him
as
doctor
now
as
professional
man
as
healer
and
this
too
without
betraying
the
impersonal
attitude
she
evidently
wore
and
had
adopted
possibly
he
wondered
in
tell
me
exactly
what
it
is
you
would
like
to
know
please
edward
she
added
and
instinctively
moved
to
the
sofa
so
that
he
might
occupy
the
professional
swinging
chair
at
the
desk
what
you
saw
nayan
he
began
accepting
the
change
of
position
without
comment
because
he
knew
it
helped
her
what
you
saw
is
of
value
i
think
first
he
had
all
his
usual
again
for
he
was
now
on
his
throne
his
seat
of
power
his
inner
attitude
changed
subtly
he
was
examining
two
patients
the
girl
and
himself
she
sat
before
him
demure
obedient
honest
very
sweet
but
very
strong
if
her
perfume
reached
him
he
did
not
notice
it
the
appeal
of
her
loveliness
went
past
him
he
did
not
see
her
eyes
he
had
a
very
comely
and
intelligent
young
woman
facing
him
and
the
glow
as
it
were
of
an
intense
inner
activity
strongly
suppressed
was
the
chief
quality
in
her
that
he
noted
but
his
new
attitude
made
other
things
too
stand
out
sharply
he
realized
there
was
confusion
in
her
own
mind
and
heart
her
being
was
not
wholly
at
one
with
itself
this
impersonal
rôle
meant
safety
until
she
was
sure
of
herself
and
so
far
she
had
been
entirely
and
admirably
no
girl
he
remembered
could
look
back
upon
what
she
had
experienced
in
the
studio
upon
what
she
had
herself
said
and
done
before
a
crowd
of
onlookers
too
without
deep
feelings
of
a
mixed
and
even
violent
kind
that
scene
with
a
young
man
she
had
never
seen
before
must
bring
painful
memories
if
it
was
love
at
first
sight
the
memories
must
be
more
painful
still
but
was
it
a
case
of
this
sudden
rapturous
love
what
indeed
were
her
feelings
what
at
any
rate
was
her
dominant
feeling
she
had
felt
his
appeal
beyond
all
question
but
was
it
as
nayan
or
as
iraida
that
she
felt
it
she
was
and
impersonal
conscious
that
therein
safety
lay
until
having
become
one
with
herself
harmonious
she
could
feel
absolutely
sure
one
hint
only
had
she
dropped
it
was
nayan
speaking
that
her
mothering
maternal
instinct
was
needed
and
that
she
must
obey
its
prompting
she
must
care
for
him
fillery
meanwhile
though
he
might
easily
have
probed
and
made
discoveries
without
her
knowing
that
he
did
so
was
not
the
man
to
use
his
powers
now
unless
she
gave
of
her
own
free
will
he
would
not
ask
he
would
close
eyes
and
ears
even
to
any
chance
betrayal
or
unconscious
revelation
when
you
first
looked
in
for
instance
you
had
just
come
in
from
the
street
i
think
you
opened
the
door
on
your
way
upstairs
do
you
remember
she
remembered
perfectly
i
wanted
to
see
who
was
there
you
i
think
were
chiefly
in
my
thoughts
i
was
wondering
if
you
had
come
her
voice
was
even
her
eyes
quite
steady
she
chose
her
next
words
slowly
i
saw
to
my
intense
surprise
a
figure
of
light
shining
you
mean
a
shining
figure
she
nodded
her
head
as
one
little
hand
put
back
a
straying
wisp
of
dark
hair
from
her
forehead
a
figure
like
flame
she
agreed
i
saw
it
quite
clearly
i
saw
everything
else
quite
clearly
too
the
inner
room
various
people
standing
about
the
piano
the
thick
smoke
everything
as
usual
i
saw
you
you
were
in
the
big
outer
room
beyond
but
your
face
was
very
distinct
you
were
staring
staring
straight
at
me
true
put
in
fillery
i
saw
you
in
the
doorway
plainly
in
the
foreground
by
itself
apart
somehow
though
surrounded
by
people
was
this
shining
radiant
outline
i
thought
it
was
a
vision
the
first
thing
of
that
sort
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
that
was
your
very
first
impression
even
before
you
had
time
to
think
yes
it
struck
you
as
unusual
i
can
not
say
more
than
that
i
knew
by
the
light
it
was
unusual
then
it
moved
talking
to
povey
or
kempster
or
someone
and
i
realized
in
a
flash
who
it
was
i
knew
it
must
be
your
friend
the
man
you
had
promised
to
bring
ju
and
then
he
asked
quickly
before
she
could
pronounce
the
name
and
then
she
stopped
and
her
eyes
looked
away
from
him
not
in
the
sense
that
they
moved
but
that
their
focus
changed
as
though
she
looked
at
something
else
at
something
within
herself
no
longer
therefore
at
the
face
in
front
of
her
he
waited
he
understood
that
she
was
searching
among
deep
strange
seething
memories
he
let
her
search
and
watching
closely
he
presently
saw
the
sight
return
into
her
eyes
from
its
inward
plunge
and
when
you
knew
who
it
was
he
asked
very
quietly
were
you
still
surprised
did
he
look
as
you
expected
him
to
look
for
instance
i
had
expected
nothing
you
see
edward
because
i
had
not
been
consciously
thinking
about
his
coming
no
mental
picture
was
present
in
me
at
all
but
the
moment
i
realized
who
it
was
the
light
seemed
to
go
i
just
saw
a
young
man
standing
there
with
his
head
turned
sideways
to
me
the
light
i
suppose
lasted
for
a
second
only
that
first
second
as
to
how
he
looked
well
he
looked
not
only
bigger
he
bigger
than
most
men
she
went
on
but
he
looked
her
voice
hushed
instinctively
a
little
on
the
adjective
different
her
companion
made
a
gesture
of
agreement
waiting
in
silence
for
what
was
to
follow
he
looked
so
extraordinary
so
wonderful
she
resumed
gazing
steadily
into
his
eyes
that
i
i
can
hardly
put
it
into
words
edward
unless
i
use
childish
language
she
broke
off
and
sighed
and
something
he
fancied
in
her
wavered
for
a
second
though
it
was
certainly
neither
the
voice
nor
the
eyes
a
faint
trembling
again
perhaps
ran
through
her
body
her
account
was
so
deliberately
truthful
that
it
impressed
him
more
than
he
quite
understood
he
was
aware
of
pathos
in
her
of
some
vague
trouble
very
poignant
yet
inexplicable
a
breath
of
awe
it
seemed
entered
the
room
and
moved
between
them
the
childish
words
are
probably
the
best
the
right
ones
he
told
her
gently
an
angel
she
said
instantly
in
a
hushed
tone
i
thought
of
an
angel
there
is
no
other
word
i
can
find
but
somehow
a
helpless
one
an
angel
out
of
place
he
looked
hard
at
her
his
manner
encouraging
though
grave
he
said
no
word
he
did
not
smile
someone
not
of
this
earth
quite
she
added
not
a
man
at
any
rate
still
more
gently
he
then
asked
her
what
she
felt
at
first
i
could
move
she
went
on
her
voice
normal
again
i
must
have
stood
there
ten
minutes
fully
perhaps
longer
her
listener
did
not
correct
the
statement
when
i
suddenly
recovered
and
looked
about
for
you
edward
but
could
not
see
you
i
needed
you
but
could
not
find
you
i
remember
feeling
somehow
that
i
had
lost
you
i
tried
to
call
for
you
in
my
heart
there
was
no
answer
then
then
i
closed
the
door
quietly
and
went
upstairs
to
change
from
my
street
clothes
she
paused
and
passed
a
hand
slowly
across
her
forehead
fillery
asked
casually
a
curious
question
do
you
remember
you
got
upstairs
nayan
her
hand
dropped
instantly
she
started
it
very
odd
you
should
ask
me
that
edward
she
said
gazing
at
him
with
a
slightly
rising
colour
in
her
face
an
increase
of
fire
glowing
in
her
eyes
very
odd
indeed
i
was
just
trying
to
think
how
i
could
describe
it
to
you
no
actually
i
do
not
remember
how
i
got
upstairs
all
i
know
is
i
was
suddenly
in
my
room
a
new
intensity
appeared
in
voice
and
manner
it
seemed
to
me
i
flew
or
that
something
carried
me
yes
nayan
yes
it
quite
natural
you
should
have
felt
like
that
is
it
i
remember
so
little
of
what
i
actually
felt
i
wonder
i
wonder
she
went
on
softly
with
an
air
almost
of
talking
to
herself
if
it
will
ever
come
back
again
what
i
felt
then
such
moments
of
subliminal
excitement
fillery
reminded
her
gently
have
the
effect
of
obliterating
memory
sometimes
excitement
she
caught
him
up
yes
i
suppose
it
was
excitement
but
it
was
more
much
more
than
that
stimulated
i
think
that
the
word
really
i
felt
caught
away
somewhere
caught
away
caught
up
as
if
into
the
rest
of
myself
into
the
whole
of
myself
i
became
vast
she
smiled
curiously
if
you
know
what
i
mean
in
several
places
at
once
perhaps
is
better
it
was
an
immense
feeling
no
i
mean
a
feeling
of
immensity
happy
his
voice
was
low
her
eyes
answered
even
before
her
words
as
the
memory
came
back
a
little
in
response
to
his
cautious
suggestion
a
new
feeling
altogether
she
replied
returning
his
clear
gaze
with
her
frank
innocent
eyes
that
had
grown
still
more
brilliant
a
feeling
i
have
never
known
before
she
talked
more
rapidly
now
leaning
forward
a
little
in
her
chair
i
felt
in
the
open
air
somehow
with
flowers
trees
hot
burning
sunshine
and
sweet
winds
rushing
to
and
fro
it
was
something
bigger
than
happiness
a
sort
of
intoxicating
joy
i
think
it
was
liberty
but
of
an
enormous
spiritual
kind
i
wanted
to
dance
i
believe
i
did
dance
yes
i
sure
i
did
and
with
hardly
anything
on
my
body
i
wanted
to
sing
i
sang
downstairs
of
course
i
heard
he
put
in
briefly
he
did
not
add
that
she
had
never
sung
like
that
before
the
moment
i
came
into
the
room
yes
i
remember
i
went
straight
to
the
piano
without
a
word
to
anyone
she
reflected
a
moment
i
suppose
i
had
to
there
was
something
new
in
me
i
could
only
express
by
music
rhythm
that
is
not
language
it
was
natural
fillery
said
again
quite
natural
i
think
yes
edward
i
suppose
it
was
she
answered
then
sank
back
in
her
chair
as
though
she
had
told
him
all
there
was
to
tell
fillery
smoked
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
then
rose
and
touched
the
bell
as
before
and
as
before
nurse
robbins
appeared
with
the
same
miraculous
speed
there
was
a
brief
colloquy
at
the
door
the
woman
was
gone
again
and
the
doctor
turned
back
into
the
room
with
a
look
of
satisfaction
on
his
face
all
apparently
was
going
well
upstairs
he
did
not
sit
down
however
he
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
drab
wintry
sky
of
motionless
clouds
his
back
to
his
companion
it
was
midday
but
the
light
while
making
all
things
visible
was
not
light
there
was
no
shine
no
touch
of
radiance
no
hint
of
sparkle
beneath
the
canopy
of
sullen
cloud
the
english
winter
day
was
visible
no
more
than
that
yet
it
was
not
the
english
day
nor
the
clouds
nor
the
bleak
dead
atmosphere
he
looked
at
in
a
single
second
his
sight
travelled
far
far
away
covering
an
enormous
interval
in
space
and
time
in
condition
too
he
saw
a
radiant
world
of
flowers
tossing
with
random
airs
of
an
unearthly
wind
he
saw
a
foam
of
forest
leaves
shaking
and
dancing
against
a
deep
blue
sky
he
say
a
valley
whose
streams
and
emerald
turf
knew
not
the
touch
of
human
feet
the
familiar
symbols
he
saw
but
inflamed
with
new
meaning
thank
you
edward
thank
you
she
was
just
behind
him
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
you
understand
everything
in
the
world
she
added
and
out
of
it
but
too
low
for
him
to
hear
he
came
back
with
an
effort
turning
towards
her
they
were
standing
level
now
and
very
close
eyes
looking
into
eyes
he
felt
her
breath
upon
his
face
her
perfume
rose
about
him
her
lips
were
moving
just
in
front
of
him
yet
for
a
second
he
did
not
know
who
she
was
it
was
as
though
had
not
come
with
him
out
of
that
valley
not
come
back
with
him
an
insatiable
longing
seized
him
to
return
and
find
her
stay
with
her
the
ache
of
an
intolerable
yearning
was
in
his
heart
yet
a
sudden
flash
of
understanding
that
brought
a
bigger
almost
an
unearthly
joy
in
its
train
at
the
call
of
some
service
some
duty
some
help
to
be
rendered
to
humanity
the
three
of
them
together
he
the
girl
were
in
temporary
exile
from
their
rightful
home
the
scent
of
wild
flowers
rose
about
him
he
suddenly
remembered
recognized
and
gave
a
little
start
he
had
left
her
behind
in
the
valley
iraida
it
was
nayan
who
now
stood
before
him
he
uttered
a
dry
little
laugh
you
startled
me
nayan
i
was
thinking
i
did
hear
you
she
had
just
thanked
him
for
something
oh
yes
because
he
had
left
her
alone
for
a
moment
giving
her
time
to
collect
herself
after
the
long
he
took
both
her
hands
in
his
patient
then
is
it
he
asked
in
a
firm
voice
looking
deep
into
her
luminous
eyes
he
saw
no
fire
in
them
now
i
do
all
i
can
edward
she
returned
the
pressure
of
his
hands
his
keen
insight
operating
in
spite
of
himself
had
read
her
clearly
it
was
mother
child
and
woman
he
had
always
known
the
three
however
were
already
in
process
of
disentanglement
for
the
first
time
during
their
long
acquaintance
what
now
stood
so
close
before
him
was
the
woman
yet
behind
the
woman
like
an
enveloping
shadow
stood
the
mother
too
and
behind
both
again
stood
another
wild
gigantic
lovely
possibility
was
it
then
the
child
that
he
had
left
playing
in
the
radiant
valley
the
child
he
knew
was
his
always
always
even
if
the
woman
was
another
he
laughed
softly
these
after
all
were
but
transitory
states
in
human
earthly
evolution
concerned
with
play
with
a
production
of
bodies
and
so
forth
he
had
lost
himself
in
her
deep
eyes
her
gaze
lay
all
over
him
over
his
entire
being
like
a
warm
soft
covering
that
blessed
and
healed
she
was
so
close
that
it
seemed
he
drew
her
breath
in
with
his
own
she
made
a
movement
then
a
tiny
gesture
he
let
go
the
hands
his
own
had
held
so
long
he
turned
from
the
window
and
from
her
he
was
trembling
what
came
later
he
resumed
in
his
calm
almost
in
his
professional
voice
you
probably
do
not
remember
he
went
towards
his
desk
we
need
not
talk
about
that
no
doubt
in
your
mind
it
all
remains
a
blurred
impression
she
interrupted
following
him
across
the
room
what
happened
edward
she
said
very
quietly
in
her
lowest
tone
it
was
all
told
to
me
but
my
memory
as
you
say
is
so
faint
as
to
be
worthless
really
what
i
do
remember
is
this
she
tapped
her
open
palm
with
two
fingers
slowly
as
she
spoke
the
words
light
heat
a
smell
of
flowers
and
a
rushing
wind
that
lifted
me
into
some
kind
of
exhilarating
liberty
where
i
felt
the
intense
joy
of
knowing
myself
somehow
free
and
greater
oh
far
greater
than
i
am
now
then
she
suddenly
whispered
again
too
low
for
him
to
catch
angelic
a
smile
as
of
glory
rippled
across
her
face
his
voice
coming
quickly
was
cool
its
tone
measured
and
you
will
come
to
see
him
the
moment
i
let
you
know
he
interrupted
abruptly
it
may
be
a
few
days
it
may
be
a
week
the
instant
it
seems
wise
he
was
entirely
practical
again
she
went
to
the
door
with
him
i
come
of
course
she
answered
as
he
opened
the
door
i
let
myself
out
edward
please
i
know
the
way
there
no
good
being
a
partner
if
one
does
know
the
way
out
she
laughed
and
in
remember
he
called
down
the
little
passage
after
her
as
with
a
smile
and
a
wave
of
the
hand
she
was
gone
he
went
back
to
his
desk
drew
a
piece
of
paper
towards
him
and
jotted
a
few
notes
down
in
briefest
fashion
the
expression
on
his
rugged
face
was
enigmatical
perhaps
but
the
sternness
at
least
was
clear
to
read
and
it
was
this
combining
with
an
extraordinary
tenderness
that
drew
out
its
nobility
intensification
of
consciousness
involving
increased
activity
of
every
centre
hearing
sight
touch
and
smell
all
affected
slight
exteriorization
of
consciousness
also
took
place
no
signs
of
split
or
divided
personality
but
an
increase
of
coherence
rather
the
central
self
active
aware
of
greater
powers
in
time
and
space
hence
sense
of
joy
heat
light
sound
motion
distinct
subliminal
followed
by
customary
loss
of
memory
later
her
being
together
with
neglected
tracts
as
yet
untouched
by
experience
her
being
reached
simultaneously
knew
herself
for
the
first
time
a
woman
but
something
more
as
well
unearthly
complex
visible
appeal
made
direct
to
subconscious
self
unfavourable
reactions
none
favourable
reactions
increased
physical
and
mental
strength
he
laid
down
his
pencil
as
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
at
its
uselessness
and
sat
back
in
the
chair
thinking
the
effect
had
upon
other
people
was
here
again
confirmed
that
at
least
seemed
reasonably
clear
vitality
was
increased
heart
and
mind
caught
up
an
extra
gear
thought
leaped
if
extravagantly
towards
speculation
emotion
deepened
if
ecstatically
towards
belief
all
the
normal
reactions
of
the
system
were
speeded
up
and
strengthened
consciousness
was
intensified
more
than
this
with
some
it
was
extended
and
subliminal
powers
were
set
free
in
his
own
experience
this
had
been
the
case
the
sight
hearing
even
a
mild
degree
of
divination
had
opened
in
his
being
it
had
similarly
taken
place
with
devonham
an
unlikely
subject
who
fought
against
acknowledging
it
father
collins
too
he
suspected
he
recalled
his
behaviour
and
strange
language
had
known
also
a
temporary
extension
of
faculty
outside
the
normal
field
he
remembered
again
the
customs
official
charing
cross
station
and
a
dozen
other
minor
instances
indications
as
yet
were
slight
he
realized
but
they
were
valuable
such
abnormal
experiences
moreover
each
one
interpreted
respectively
in
the
terms
of
his
own
individual
being
of
his
own
temperament
his
own
personal
shibboleths
the
law
governing
unusual
experience
operated
invariably
was
not
his
own
particular
vision
easily
explained
it
might
indeed
had
it
happened
earlier
have
found
a
place
in
his
own
book
of
advanced
psychology
he
reflected
rapidly
he
believed
the
industrial
system
lay
at
the
root
of
civilization
crumbling
and
that
man
must
return
to
nature
therefore
his
yearnings
dramatized
themselves
in
personified
representations
of
the
beauty
of
nature
he
could
trace
every
detail
of
his
vision
to
some
intense
but
unrealized
yearning
to
some
deep
hope
desire
dream
as
yet
unfulfilled
always
these
yearnings
and
wishes
unfulfilled
colour
form
and
sound
again
he
used
them
one
and
all
in
his
treatment
of
special
cases
and
felt
hurt
by
the
ignorant
scoffing
and
denial
of
his
brother
doctors
hence
their
present
dramatization
his
immense
belief
again
in
the
results
upon
the
race
when
once
the
subliminal
powers
should
have
reached
the
stage
where
they
could
be
used
at
will
for
practical
purposes
this
in
its
turn
led
him
to
hope
perhaps
to
believe
that
this
strange
case
might
prove
to
be
some
fabulous
bright
messenger
who
brought
glad
tidings
all
all
was
explicable
enough
a
smile
stole
over
his
face
he
began
to
laugh
quietly
to
himself
yes
he
could
explain
all
trace
all
to
something
or
other
in
his
being
yet
he
knew
that
the
real
explanation
well
his
cleverest
intellectual
explanation
and
analysis
were
worthless
after
all
for
here
lay
something
utterly
beyond
his
knowledge
and
experience
the
note
of
another
searcher
recurred
to
him
each
human
being
has
within
himself
that
restless
creative
phantasy
which
is
ever
engaged
in
assuaging
the
harshness
of
reality
whoever
gives
himself
unsparingly
and
carefully
to
will
realize
that
there
dwells
within
him
something
which
would
gladly
hide
up
and
cover
all
that
is
difficult
and
questionable
in
life
and
thus
procure
an
easy
and
free
path
insanity
grants
the
upper
hand
to
this
something
when
once
it
is
uppermost
reality
is
more
or
less
quickly
driven
out
but
he
knew
quite
well
that
although
he
belonged
to
what
he
called
the
unstable
the
something
which
jung
referred
to
had
by
no
means
obtained
the
upper
hand
the
vista
opening
to
his
inner
sight
led
towards
a
new
reality
ah
if
he
could
only
persuade
paul
devonham
to
see
what
saw
chapter
xxii
lady
gleeson
had
heard
from
a
promethean
what
had
transpired
in
the
studio
after
she
had
left
and
her
interest
was
immensely
stimulated
these
details
she
had
not
known
when
she
had
driven
her
hero
home
and
had
felt
so
strangely
drawn
to
him
that
she
had
kissed
him
in
front
of
fillery
as
though
she
caressed
a
prisoner
under
the
eyes
of
the
warder
she
made
her
little
plans
accordingly
it
was
some
days
however
before
they
bore
fruit
the
telephone
at
last
rang
it
was
fillery
the
nerves
in
her
quivered
with
anticipation
devonham
it
appeared
had
been
away
and
her
kind
letters
and
presents
he
regretted
to
find
had
remained
unanswered
and
unacknowledged
levallon
had
been
in
the
country
too
with
his
colleague
and
letters
had
not
been
forwarded
oh
it
would
do
him
good
to
see
people
it
would
be
delightful
if
she
could
spare
a
moment
to
look
in
perhaps
for
a
cup
of
tea
no
she
was
engaged
the
next
day
then
the
next
day
it
was
in
the
morning
arrived
a
brief
letter
from
levallon
himself
you
will
come
to
tea
i
thank
julian
levallon
yet
there
was
something
both
in
fillery
voice
as
in
this
enigmatic
letter
that
she
did
not
like
she
felt
puzzled
somewhere
the
excitement
of
a
novel
intrigue
with
this
unusual
youth
none
the
less
was
stimulating
she
decided
to
go
to
tea
she
put
off
a
couple
of
engagements
in
order
to
be
free
a
servant
let
her
in
she
went
upstairs
there
was
no
sign
of
fillery
nor
thank
heaven
of
devonham
either
tea
she
saw
was
laid
for
two
in
the
private
levallon
seated
in
an
by
the
open
window
looked
magnificent
and
overpowering
as
she
called
it
he
rose
at
once
to
greet
her
thank
you
he
said
in
his
great
voice
i
am
glad
to
see
you
he
said
it
perfectly
as
though
it
had
been
taught
him
he
took
her
hand
her
ravishing
smile
perhaps
he
did
not
notice
his
face
at
any
rate
was
grave
his
height
his
broad
shoulders
his
inexperienced
eyes
and
manner
again
delighted
lady
gleeson
the
effect
upon
her
receptive
temperament
at
any
rate
was
instantaneous
that
he
showed
no
cordiality
did
not
smile
and
that
his
manner
was
constrained
meant
nothing
to
her
or
meant
what
she
wished
it
to
mean
he
was
somewhat
overcome
of
course
she
reflected
that
she
was
here
at
all
she
began
at
once
sitting
composedly
on
the
edge
of
the
table
so
that
her
pretty
silk
stockings
were
visible
to
the
extent
she
thought
just
right
she
dangled
her
slim
legs
and
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
she
was
full
of
confidence
her
attitude
said
plainly
i
taking
a
lot
of
trouble
but
you
worth
it
levallon
she
purred
in
a
teasing
yet
determined
voice
why
do
you
ignore
me
there
was
an
air
of
finality
about
the
words
she
meant
to
know
levallon
met
her
eyes
with
a
look
of
puzzled
surprise
but
did
not
answer
he
stood
in
front
of
her
he
looked
really
magnificent
a
perfect
study
of
the
athlete
in
repose
he
might
have
been
a
fine
greek
statue
why
she
repeated
her
lip
quivering
slightly
do
you
ignore
me
i
want
the
truth
she
added
she
was
delighted
to
see
how
taken
aback
he
was
you
do
dislike
me
it
was
not
a
question
into
his
eyes
stole
an
expression
she
could
not
exactly
fathom
she
judged
however
that
he
felt
awkward
foolish
her
interest
doubtless
robbed
him
of
any
he
might
possess
this
talk
face
to
face
was
a
little
too
much
for
any
young
man
but
for
a
simple
country
youth
it
was
of
course
more
than
disconcerting
i
lady
gleeson
she
informed
him
smiling
precisely
in
the
way
she
knew
had
troubled
so
many
other
men
angela
she
added
softly
you
had
my
books
and
flowers
and
letters
yet
you
continue
to
ignore
me
why
please
with
a
different
smile
and
a
pathetic
childish
voice
have
i
offended
you
somehow
do
i
displease
you
levallon
stared
at
her
as
though
he
was
not
quite
certain
who
she
actually
was
yet
as
though
he
ought
to
know
and
that
her
words
now
reminded
him
he
stared
at
her
with
what
she
called
his
awkward
and
confused
expression
but
which
fillery
had
he
been
present
would
have
recognized
as
due
to
his
desire
to
help
a
pitiful
and
hungry
creature
that
in
a
word
his
instinct
for
service
had
been
a
little
stirred
the
scene
was
certainly
curious
and
unusual
levallon
with
his
great
strength
and
dignity
yet
something
tender
pathetic
in
his
bearing
stood
staring
at
her
lady
gleeson
brimming
with
a
sense
of
easy
victory
sat
on
the
her
pretty
legs
well
forward
knowing
herself
divinely
gowned
she
had
her
victim
surely
at
a
disadvantage
she
felt
at
the
same
time
a
faint
uneasiness
she
could
not
understand
she
concealed
it
however
i
suffer
here
he
said
suddenly
in
a
quiet
tone
she
gave
a
start
it
was
the
phrase
he
had
used
before
she
thrilled
she
hitched
her
skirt
a
fraction
higher
julian
poor
boy
she
said
then
stared
at
him
how
innocent
you
are
she
said
it
with
apparent
impulse
though
her
little
frenzied
mind
was
busy
calculating
there
came
a
pause
he
said
nothing
he
was
apparently
quite
innocent
extraordinarily
exasperatingly
innocent
in
a
low
voice
smiling
shyly
she
added
as
though
it
cost
her
a
great
effort
you
do
not
recognize
what
is
yours
you
are
sacred
he
replied
with
startling
directness
as
though
he
suddenly
understood
yet
was
stupidly
perplexed
you
already
have
your
man
lady
gleeson
gulped
down
a
spasm
of
laughter
how
slow
these
countrymen
could
be
yet
she
must
not
shock
him
he
was
suffering
besides
this
yokel
from
the
woods
and
mountains
needed
a
little
coaxing
it
was
natural
enough
she
must
explain
and
teach
it
seemed
well
he
was
worth
the
trouble
his
beauty
was
mastering
her
already
she
loved
in
particular
his
innocence
his
shyness
his
obvious
respect
she
almost
felt
herself
a
magnanimous
woman
my
man
she
mentioned
oh
he
finished
with
me
long
ago
bored
he
has
gone
elsewhere
i
am
alone
she
added
with
an
impromptu
inspiration
and
free
to
choose
it
must
be
pain
and
loneliness
to
you
levallon
looked
she
thought
embarrassed
he
was
struggling
with
himself
of
course
she
left
the
table
and
came
up
close
to
him
she
stood
on
tiptoe
so
that
her
breath
might
touch
his
face
her
eyes
shone
with
fire
her
voice
trembled
a
little
it
was
very
low
i
choose
she
whispered
she
cast
down
her
shining
eyes
her
lips
took
on
a
prim
inviting
turn
she
knew
she
was
irresistible
like
that
she
stood
back
a
step
as
if
expecting
some
tumultuous
onslaught
she
waited
but
the
onslaught
did
not
come
levallon
towering
above
her
merely
stared
his
arms
hung
motionless
there
was
indeed
expression
in
his
face
but
it
was
not
the
expression
that
she
expected
longed
for
deemed
her
due
it
puzzled
her
as
something
entirely
new
me
he
repeated
in
an
even
tone
he
gazed
at
her
in
a
peculiar
way
was
it
appraisement
was
it
halting
wonder
at
his
marvellous
good
fortune
was
it
that
he
hesitated
judging
her
he
seemed
she
thought
once
for
an
instant
curiously
indifferent
something
in
his
voice
startled
her
the
moment
pause
at
any
rate
was
afflicting
her
spirit
burned
within
her
only
her
supreme
belief
in
herself
prevented
a
premature
explosion
yet
something
troubled
her
as
well
a
tremor
ran
through
her
levallon
she
remembered
was
levallon
his
own
thought
and
feeling
lay
hidden
from
her
blunt
perception
since
she
read
no
signs
unless
they
were
painfully
obvious
but
in
his
mind
in
his
feeling
rather
since
he
did
not
think
ran
evidently
the
sudden
knowledge
of
what
her
meaning
was
he
understood
but
also
perhaps
he
remembered
what
fillery
had
told
him
for
a
long
time
he
kept
silent
the
emotions
in
him
apparently
at
grips
was
he
suddenly
going
to
carry
her
away
as
he
had
done
to
that
little
russian
poseuse
she
watched
him
he
was
intensely
busy
with
what
occupied
his
mind
for
though
he
did
not
speak
his
lips
were
moving
she
watched
him
impatience
and
wonder
in
her
impatience
at
his
slowness
wonder
as
to
what
he
would
do
and
say
when
at
last
his
simple
mind
had
decided
and
again
the
odd
touch
of
fear
stole
over
her
something
warned
her
this
young
man
thrilled
her
but
he
certainly
was
strange
this
was
indeed
a
new
experience
whatever
was
he
thinking
about
what
in
the
world
was
he
going
to
say
his
lips
were
still
moving
there
was
a
light
in
his
face
she
imagined
the
very
words
could
almost
read
them
hear
them
there
then
she
heard
them
heard
some
at
any
rate
distinctly
you
are
an
animal
yet
you
walk
upright
the
scene
that
followed
went
like
lightning
before
lady
gleeson
could
move
or
speak
however
he
also
said
another
thing
that
for
one
pulsing
second
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
made
her
own
utter
worthlessness
become
appallingly
clear
to
her
it
explained
the
touch
of
fear
even
her
one
true
thing
her
animal
passion
was
a
trumpery
affair
there
is
nothing
in
you
i
can
work
with
he
said
with
gentle
pitying
sympathy
nothing
i
can
use
then
lady
gleeson
blazed
vanity
instantly
restored
it
seemed
impossible
to
believe
her
ears
what
had
he
done
what
had
he
said
that
caused
the
explosion
he
watched
her
abrupt
spasmodic
movements
with
amazement
they
were
so
ugly
so
unrhythmical
their
violence
was
so
wasteful
you
insult
me
she
cried
making
these
violent
movements
of
her
whole
body
that
to
him
were
unintelligible
how
dare
you
you
the
breath
choked
her
cad
he
helped
her
so
suddenly
that
another
mind
not
far
away
might
almost
have
dropped
the
word
purposely
into
his
own
i
am
so
pained
he
added
so
pained
he
gazed
at
her
as
though
he
longed
to
help
for
you
i
know
are
valuable
to
him
who
holds
you
sacred
to
your
husband
lady
gleeson
simply
could
not
credit
her
ears
this
neat
though
unintentional
way
of
transferring
the
epithet
to
her
who
deserved
it
left
her
speechless
her
fury
increased
with
her
inability
to
express
it
she
could
have
struck
him
killed
him
on
the
spot
her
face
changed
from
white
to
crimson
like
some
toy
with
a
trick
of
light
inside
it
she
seemed
to
emit
sparks
she
was
transfixed
and
the
shiver
that
ran
through
her
was
perhaps
for
once
both
sexual
and
spiritual
at
once
you
insult
me
she
cried
again
helplessly
you
insult
me
if
there
was
something
in
you
i
could
work
with
help
he
began
his
face
showing
a
tender
sympathy
that
enraged
her
even
more
he
started
suddenly
looking
closer
into
her
blazing
eyes
ah
he
said
quickly
below
his
breath
the
fire
the
little
fire
his
expression
altered
but
lady
gleeson
full
of
her
grievance
did
not
catch
the
words
it
in
my
tenderest
my
most
womanly
feelings
she
choked
on
yet
noticing
the
altered
expression
on
his
face
how
her
voice
became
shrill
and
staccato
then
suddenly
mistaking
the
look
in
his
eyes
for
shame
she
added
you
shall
apologize
you
shall
apologize
at
once
she
screamed
the
words
they
were
the
only
ones
that
her
outraged
feelings
found
you
show
yourself
my
fire
he
was
saying
softly
in
his
deep
resonant
voice
oh
i
see
and
worship
now
i
understand
a
little
his
look
astonished
her
even
in
the
middle
of
her
anger
the
pity
kindness
gentleness
in
it
the
bewilderment
she
did
not
notice
it
was
the
evident
desire
to
be
of
service
to
her
to
help
and
comfort
that
infuriated
her
the
superiority
was
more
than
she
could
stand
and
on
your
knees
she
yelped
on
your
knees
too
drawing
herself
up
she
pointed
to
the
carpet
with
an
air
of
some
tragedy
queen
to
whom
a
lost
came
slowly
back
down
there
she
added
as
the
gleaming
buckle
on
her
shoe
indicated
the
spot
she
did
not
forget
to
show
her
pretty
stockings
as
well
the
picture
was
comic
in
the
extreme
yet
with
a
pathetic
twist
about
it
that
had
she
possessed
a
single
grain
of
humour
must
have
made
her
feel
foolish
and
shamed
until
she
died
for
his
kneeling
position
rendered
her
insignificance
so
obvious
it
was
painful
in
the
extreme
levallon
clasped
his
hands
his
face
wearing
a
dignity
and
tenderness
that
emphasized
its
singular
innocence
and
beauty
gazed
up
into
her
trivial
prettiness
as
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
behind
her
glaring
down
at
him
with
angry
but
still
hungry
eyes
i
should
have
helped
and
worshipped
his
deep
voice
thrilled
i
am
ashamed
always
you
are
sacred
wonderful
i
did
not
recognize
your
presence
calling
me
i
did
not
hear
nor
understand
i
am
ashamed
the
strange
words
she
did
not
comprehend
even
if
she
heard
them
properly
for
one
moment
she
knew
a
dreadful
feeling
that
they
were
not
addressed
to
her
at
all
but
the
sense
of
returning
triumph
the
burning
desire
to
extract
from
him
the
last
ounce
of
humiliation
to
make
him
suffer
as
much
as
in
her
power
lay
these
emotions
deadened
any
perceptions
of
a
subtler
kind
he
was
kneeling
at
her
feet
stammering
his
abject
apology
and
the
sight
was
wine
and
food
to
her
though
she
could
have
crushed
him
with
her
foot
she
could
equally
have
flung
herself
in
utter
abandonment
before
his
glorious
crouching
strength
she
adored
the
scene
he
looked
magnificent
on
his
knees
he
was
she
believed
she
too
looked
magnificent
you
apologize
to
me
she
said
in
a
trembling
voice
tense
with
mingled
passions
oh
with
what
sadness
for
my
mistake
you
can
not
know
was
his
strange
reply
his
voice
rang
with
sincerity
his
eyes
held
a
yearning
that
almost
lent
him
radiance
yet
it
was
the
sense
of
power
he
gave
that
thrilled
lady
gleeson
most
for
she
could
not
understand
it
again
a
passing
hint
of
something
remote
incalculable
touched
her
sense
of
awe
she
shivered
slightly
levallon
did
not
move
appeased
yet
puzzled
she
lowered
her
face
now
pale
and
intense
with
eagerness
towards
his
own
hardly
conscious
that
she
did
so
while
the
faint
idea
again
went
past
her
that
he
addressed
his
astonishing
words
elsewhere
blind
vanity
at
once
dismissed
the
notion
though
the
shock
of
its
brief
disthroning
had
been
painful
she
found
satisfaction
for
her
wounded
soul
a
man
who
had
scorned
her
now
squirmed
before
her
beauty
on
his
knees
desiring
her
but
too
late
you
have
manhood
after
all
she
exclaimed
still
fierce
the
upper
lip
just
revealing
the
shining
little
teeth
her
power
at
last
had
touched
him
he
suffered
and
she
was
glad
i
worship
he
repeated
looking
through
her
this
time
if
not
actually
past
her
you
are
sacred
the
source
of
all
my
life
and
power
his
pain
his
worship
the
aching
passion
in
him
made
her
forget
the
insult
upon
that
face
upturned
so
close
to
hers
she
now
breathed
softly
i
try
she
said
more
calmly
i
try
and
forgive
you
just
this
once
the
suffering
in
his
eyes
so
close
against
her
own
dawned
more
and
more
on
her
there
now
she
added
impulsively
perhaps
i
will
forgive
you
altogether
it
was
a
moment
of
immense
and
queenly
generosity
she
felt
sublime
levallon
however
made
no
rejoinder
one
might
have
thought
he
had
not
heard
only
his
head
sank
lower
a
little
before
her
she
had
him
at
her
mercy
now
the
rapt
and
wonderful
expression
in
his
eyes
delighted
her
she
bent
slightly
nearer
and
made
as
though
to
kiss
him
when
a
new
idea
flashed
suddenly
through
her
mind
this
forgiveness
was
a
shade
too
quick
too
easy
oh
she
knew
men
she
was
not
without
experience
she
acted
with
instant
decision
upon
her
new
idea
as
though
delay
might
tempt
her
to
yield
too
soon
she
straightened
up
with
a
sudden
jerk
touched
his
cheek
with
her
hand
then
with
a
swinging
swish
of
her
skirts
but
without
a
single
further
word
she
swept
across
the
room
she
went
out
throwing
him
a
last
glance
just
before
she
closed
the
door
at
his
kneeling
figure
and
upturned
face
she
flung
this
last
glance
of
murderous
fascination
but
levallon
did
not
move
or
turn
his
head
he
made
no
sign
his
attitude
remained
precisely
as
before
face
upturned
hands
clasped
his
expression
rapt
and
grave
as
ever
his
voice
continued
i
worship
you
for
ever
i
did
not
know
you
in
that
little
shape
o
wondrous
central
fire
teach
me
to
be
aware
of
you
with
awe
with
joy
with
love
even
in
the
smallest
things
o
perfect
flame
behind
all
form
for
a
long
time
his
deep
tones
poured
their
resonant
vibration
through
the
room
there
came
an
answering
music
low
faint
continuous
a
long
deep
rhythm
running
in
it
there
was
a
scent
of
flowers
of
open
space
a
fragrance
of
a
mountain
top
the
sounds
the
perfume
the
touch
of
cool
refreshing
wind
rose
round
him
increasing
with
every
minute
till
it
seemed
as
though
some
energy
informed
them
at
the
centre
he
knelt
steadily
light
glowing
faintly
in
his
face
and
on
his
skin
a
vortex
of
energy
swept
round
him
he
drew
upon
it
his
own
energy
was
increased
and
multiplied
he
seemed
to
grow
more
radiant
a
few
minutes
later
the
door
opened
softly
and
fillery
looked
in
hesitated
for
a
second
then
advanced
into
the
room
he
paused
before
the
kneeling
figure
it
was
noticeable
that
he
was
not
startled
and
that
his
face
wore
no
expression
of
surprise
a
smile
indeed
lay
on
his
lips
he
noticed
the
scent
of
flowers
a
sweetness
in
the
air
as
after
rain
he
felt
the
immense
vitality
the
exhilaration
the
peace
and
power
too
he
had
made
no
sound
but
the
other
aware
of
his
presence
rose
to
his
feet
i
disturbed
you
said
fillery
i
sorry
shall
i
go
i
was
worshipping
replied
no
do
not
go
there
was
a
little
flash
he
looked
about
him
for
an
instant
as
if
slightly
bewildered
a
little
sign
something
i
might
have
helped
but
it
has
gone
again
then
i
worshipped
asking
for
more
power
notice
it
he
asked
with
a
radiant
smile
i
notice
it
said
fillery
smiling
back
he
paused
a
moment
his
eye
took
in
the
and
saw
they
were
untouched
he
felt
the
it
was
still
warm
come
he
said
happily
we
have
some
tea
together
i
send
for
a
fresh
brew
he
rang
the
bell
then
arranged
the
chairs
a
little
differently
your
visitor
he
asked
you
are
expecting
someone
looked
round
him
suddenly
oh
he
exclaimed
but
she
has
gone
his
surprise
was
comical
but
the
expression
on
the
face
changed
in
his
rapid
way
at
once
i
remember
now
your
lady
gleeson
came
he
added
a
touch
of
gentle
sadness
in
his
voice
i
gave
her
pain
you
had
told
me
i
forgot
you
did
well
fillery
commented
with
smiling
approval
as
though
the
entire
scene
was
known
to
him
you
did
very
well
it
is
a
pity
only
that
she
left
too
soon
if
she
had
stayed
for
your
worship
your
wind
and
fire
might
have
helped
shook
his
head
there
is
nothing
i
can
work
with
he
replied
she
is
empty
she
destroys
only
why
he
added
does
she
walk
upright
but
lady
gleeson
held
very
different
views
upon
the
recent
scene
this
magnificent
young
male
she
had
put
in
his
place
but
she
had
not
finished
with
him
no
such
being
had
entered
her
life
before
she
was
woman
enough
to
see
he
was
unusual
but
he
was
magnificent
as
well
and
secretly
she
loved
his
grand
indifference
she
left
the
house
however
with
but
an
uncertain
feeling
that
the
honours
were
with
her
two
days
without
a
word
a
sign
from
her
would
bring
him
begging
to
her
little
feet
but
the
begging
did
not
come
the
bell
was
silent
the
post
brought
no
humble
passionate
abandoned
letter
she
fumed
she
waited
her
husband
recently
returned
to
london
and
immensely
preoccupied
with
his
concessions
her
maid
too
were
aware
that
lady
gleeson
was
impatient
the
third
the
fourth
day
came
but
still
no
letter
whereupon
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
possibly
gone
too
far
having
left
him
on
his
knees
he
was
perhaps
still
kneeling
in
his
heart
even
prostrate
with
shame
and
disappointment
afraid
to
write
afraid
to
call
he
knew
not
what
to
do
she
had
evidently
administered
too
severe
a
lesson
her
callers
meanwhile
convinced
her
that
she
was
irresistible
there
was
no
woman
like
her
in
the
world
she
had
of
course
been
too
harsh
and
cruel
with
this
magnificent
and
innocent
youth
from
the
woods
and
mountains
thus
it
was
that
on
the
fourth
day
feeling
magnanimous
and
generous
too
she
wrote
to
him
it
would
be
foolish
in
any
case
to
lose
him
altogether
merely
for
a
moment
pride
dear
levallon
i
feel
i
must
send
you
a
tiny
word
to
let
you
know
that
i
really
have
forgiven
you
you
behaved
you
know
in
a
way
that
no
man
of
my
acquaintance
has
ever
done
before
but
i
feel
sure
now
you
did
not
really
mean
it
your
forest
and
mountain
gods
have
not
taught
you
to
understand
civilized
women
so
i
forgive
please
forget
it
all
as
i
have
forgotten
yours
angela
gleeson
and
you
may
come
and
see
me
soon
to
which
two
days
later
came
the
reply
dear
lady
gleeson
i
thank
you
julian
levallon
within
an
hour
of
its
receipt
she
wrote
dear
julian
i
am
so
glad
you
understand
i
knew
you
would
you
may
come
and
see
me
i
will
prove
to
you
that
you
are
really
forgiven
there
is
no
need
to
feel
embarrassed
i
am
interested
in
you
and
can
help
you
believe
me
you
need
a
woman
guidance
all
i
have
is
yours
i
shall
be
at
home
this
afternoon
alone
from
to
i
shall
expect
you
my
love
to
you
and
your
grand
wild
gods
yours
angela
i
want
you
to
tell
me
more
about
your
gods
will
you
she
sent
it
by
special
messenger
reply
underlined
on
the
envelope
he
did
not
appear
at
the
appointed
hour
but
the
next
morning
she
received
his
letter
it
came
by
ordinary
post
the
writing
on
the
envelope
was
not
his
either
devonham
or
fillery
had
addressed
it
and
a
twinge
of
unaccustomed
emotion
troubled
her
intuition
it
seems
survives
even
in
the
coarsest
most
degraded
feminine
nature
ruins
of
some
divine
prerogative
perhaps
lady
gleeson
at
any
rate
flinched
uneasily
before
she
opened
the
long
expected
missive
dear
lady
gleeson
be
sure
that
you
are
always
under
the
protection
of
the
gods
even
if
you
do
not
know
them
they
are
impersonal
they
come
to
you
through
passion
but
not
through
that
love
of
the
naked
body
which
is
lust
i
can
work
with
passion
because
it
is
creative
but
not
with
lust
for
it
is
destructive
only
your
suffering
is
the
youth
and
ignorance
of
the
young
uncreative
animal
i
can
strive
with
young
animals
and
can
help
them
but
i
can
not
work
with
them
i
beg
you
listen
i
love
in
you
the
fire
though
it
is
faint
and
julian
lady
gleeson
read
this
letter
in
front
of
the
then
stared
at
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
she
was
dazed
but
in
spite
of
the
language
she
thought
silly
she
caught
the
blunt
refusal
of
her
generous
offer
she
understood
yet
unable
to
believe
it
she
looked
at
her
reflection
again
then
impulsively
went
downstairs
to
see
her
husband
it
really
was
more
than
she
could
bear
the
man
was
mad
but
that
did
not
excuse
him
he
is
a
beast
she
informed
her
husband
tearing
up
the
letter
angrily
before
his
eyes
in
the
library
while
he
watched
her
with
a
slavish
admiration
that
increased
her
fury
he
is
nothing
but
an
animal
she
added
he
a
a
who
came
the
question
as
though
it
had
been
asked
before
for
sir
george
wore
a
stolid
and
a
patient
expression
on
his
kindly
face
that
man
levallon
she
told
him
one
of
fillery
cases
i
tried
to
to
help
now
he
written
to
me
george
looked
up
with
infinite
patience
and
desire
in
his
kindly
gaze
cut
him
out
he
said
dryly
as
though
he
was
accustomed
to
such
scenes
let
him
rip
why
bother
anyway
with
and
he
crossed
the
room
to
comfort
her
knowing
that
presently
the
reaction
must
make
him
seem
more
desirable
than
he
really
was
never
in
my
house
again
she
sighed
as
he
approached
her
lovingly
his
fingers
in
his
close
brown
beard
he
is
simply
a
beast
an
animal
chapter
xxiii
it
was
perhaps
some
cosmic
humour
in
the
silent
beautiful
stars
which
planned
that
nayan
visit
should
follow
upon
the
very
heels
of
lady
gleeson
call
those
vast
intelligences
who
note
the
fall
of
even
a
feather
watching
and
guarding
the
race
so
closely
that
they
may
be
said
in
human
terms
to
love
it
arranged
the
details
possibly
enjoying
the
result
with
their
careless
sunny
laughter
at
any
rate
fillery
quickly
sent
her
word
and
she
came
to
lust
had
not
reacted
how
would
it
be
with
love
the
beautiful
girl
entered
the
room
slowly
shyly
as
though
certain
of
herself
she
was
not
quite
certain
what
she
was
about
to
meet
fillery
had
told
her
she
could
help
that
she
was
needed
therefore
she
came
there
was
no
thought
of
self
in
her
her
first
visit
to
julian
levallon
after
his
behaviour
in
the
studio
had
no
selfish
motive
in
it
her
however
went
only
to
a
certain
point
in
the
interview
with
fillery
she
had
easily
controlled
herself
she
was
not
so
sure
that
her
would
be
adequate
now
though
calm
outwardly
an
inexpressible
turmoil
surged
within
she
remembered
his
strength
virility
and
admiration
as
a
woman
his
ingenuous
childlike
innocence
an
odd
appealing
helplessness
in
it
somewhere
touched
the
mother
in
her
that
she
divined
this
latter
was
perhaps
the
secret
of
her
power
over
men
independent
of
all
they
had
to
offer
she
touched
the
highest
in
them
by
making
them
feel
they
had
need
of
the
highest
in
herself
she
obtained
thus
without
desiring
it
the
influence
that
lady
gleeson
her
antithesis
lacked
they
called
her
nayan
the
impersonal
the
impersonal
in
her
nevertheless
that
which
had
withstood
the
cunning
onslaught
of
every
type
of
male
successfully
had
received
a
fundamental
shock
both
her
modesty
and
dignity
had
been
assailed
and
in
public
others
women
among
them
had
witnessed
her
apparent
yielding
to
levallon
violence
and
seen
her
carried
in
his
arms
they
had
noted
her
obvious
willingness
had
heard
her
sympathetic
cry
she
knew
quite
well
what
the
women
thought
lady
gleeson
had
written
a
little
note
of
sympathy
the
men
as
well
and
yet
she
came
at
fillery
call
to
visit
perhaps
to
help
the
offender
who
had
caused
it
all
as
she
opened
the
door
every
nerve
she
possessed
was
tingling
the
mother
in
her
yearned
but
the
woman
in
her
sent
the
blood
rushing
from
her
heart
in
pride
in
resentment
in
something
of
anger
as
well
how
had
he
dared
to
seize
her
in
that
awful
way
the
outrage
and
the
love
both
tore
at
her
yet
nayan
was
not
the
kind
to
shirk
when
it
came
she
brought
some
hidden
secret
with
her
although
as
yet
herself
uncertain
what
that
secret
was
fillery
met
her
on
the
threshold
with
his
sweet
tact
and
sympathy
as
usual
he
had
an
authoritative
and
paternal
air
that
helped
and
comforted
her
and
as
she
took
his
hand
at
once
the
look
she
gave
him
was
more
kind
and
tender
than
she
knew
the
last
trace
of
self
at
any
rate
went
out
of
her
as
she
felt
his
touch
here
i
am
she
said
you
sent
for
me
i
promised
you
he
replied
in
a
low
tone
there
no
need
to
refer
to
anything
of
course
assume
i
suggest
that
he
has
forgotten
all
that
happened
and
you
have
forgotten
too
he
was
aware
of
nothing
but
her
eyes
the
softness
the
delicate
perfume
the
perfect
voice
even
the
fur
and
flowers
all
were
summed
up
in
her
eyes
alone
in
those
eyes
he
could
have
lost
himself
perhaps
for
ever
he
led
her
into
the
room
a
certain
abruptness
in
his
manner
i
shall
leave
you
alone
he
whispered
using
his
professional
voice
it
is
best
that
he
should
see
you
quite
alone
i
shall
not
be
far
away
but
you
will
find
him
perfectly
quiet
he
understands
that
you
are
his
tone
changed
upon
the
adjective
sacred
sacred
she
murmured
to
herself
repeating
the
word
sacred
they
smiled
and
the
door
closed
behind
her
across
the
room
rose
the
tall
figure
of
the
man
she
had
come
to
see
dressed
in
dark
blue
a
low
white
shirt
open
at
the
neck
a
blue
tie
that
matched
the
strong
clear
eyes
the
wondrous
hair
crowning
the
whole
like
a
flame
the
slant
of
wintry
sunlight
by
chance
just
caught
the
great
figure
as
it
rose
lightly
easily
as
though
it
floated
up
out
of
the
floor
before
her
and
as
by
magic
the
last
uncertainty
in
her
disappeared
she
knew
herself
akin
to
this
radiant
shape
of
blue
and
gold
knew
also
mysteriously
in
a
way
entirely
beyond
her
to
explain
knew
why
edward
fillery
was
dear
to
her
was
it
that
something
in
the
three
of
them
pertained
to
a
common
origin
the
conviction
half
thought
half
feeling
rose
in
her
as
she
looked
into
the
blue
eyes
facing
her
and
took
the
outstretched
hand
you
strange
lost
being
no
one
will
understand
you
here
the
words
flashed
through
her
mind
of
their
own
accord
instantly
spontaneously
yet
were
almost
forgotten
the
same
second
in
the
surge
of
more
commonplace
feeling
that
rose
after
only
the
here
proved
their
origin
not
entirely
forgotten
it
was
the
selfless
mothering
instinct
that
now
dominated
but
the
division
in
her
being
had
none
the
less
been
indicated
as
by
a
white
piercing
light
that
searched
her
inmost
nature
that
added
here
laid
bare
she
felt
some
part
of
her
which
with
all
other
men
was
clothed
and
covered
away
realized
though
dimly
this
troubled
her
clear
mind
as
she
took
the
chair
he
offered
the
conviction
that
she
must
tend
and
care
for
even
love
this
strange
youth
as
though
he
were
in
exile
and
none
but
herself
could
understand
him
she
heard
the
deep
resonant
voice
in
the
air
in
front
of
her
i
am
not
lost
now
he
said
with
his
radiant
smile
and
as
if
he
perceived
her
thought
from
the
expression
in
her
face
i
wished
to
take
you
away
to
take
you
back
i
wish
it
still
he
stood
gazing
down
at
her
the
deep
tones
the
shining
eyes
the
towering
stature
with
its
quiet
strength
these
added
to
the
directness
of
the
language
confused
her
for
a
moment
the
words
were
so
entirely
unexpected
fillery
had
led
her
to
suppose
otherwise
yet
before
the
blazing
innocence
in
his
face
and
manner
her
composure
at
once
returned
she
found
no
words
at
first
she
smiled
up
into
his
eyes
then
pointed
to
a
chair
seated
he
would
be
more
manageable
she
felt
his
upright
stature
was
so
overpowering
you
had
forgotten
he
went
on
obeying
her
wish
and
sitting
down
but
i
could
not
know
that
you
had
forgotten
i
apologize
the
word
sounded
oddly
on
his
lips
as
though
learned
recently
for
making
you
suffer
forgotten
a
swift
intuition
due
to
some
as
yet
undecipherable
kinship
told
her
that
the
word
bore
no
reference
to
the
studio
scene
some
larger
meaning
scaled
to
an
immenser
map
came
with
it
an
unrealized
emotion
stirred
faintly
in
her
as
she
heard
her
first
sight
of
him
as
a
figure
of
light
returned
but
that
is
all
forgiven
now
she
replied
calmly
in
her
firm
gentle
voice
we
need
not
speak
of
it
you
understand
now
she
ended
lamely
that
it
is
not
possible
he
listened
intently
gravely
as
though
with
a
certain
effort
his
head
bent
forward
to
catch
every
syllable
and
as
he
bent
peering
listening
he
might
have
been
some
being
staring
down
through
a
window
in
the
sky
into
the
small
confusions
of
affairs
yes
he
said
the
moment
she
stopped
speaking
i
understand
now
i
shall
never
make
you
suffer
again
only
i
could
not
know
that
you
had
forgotten
so
completely
forgotten
she
again
repeated
in
spite
of
herself
for
the
way
he
uttered
the
word
again
stirred
that
nameless
deep
emotion
in
her
their
attitudes
respectively
were
changing
she
no
longer
felt
that
she
could
mother
this
great
figure
before
her
where
we
belong
he
answered
in
his
great
quiet
voice
he
added
in
a
way
that
made
it
the
counterpart
of
her
own
spontaneous
and
intuitive
here
it
is
so
easy
i
had
forgotten
too
but
fillery
dear
fillery
helps
me
to
remember
and
the
stars
and
flowers
and
wind
these
help
me
too
and
then
you
when
i
saw
i
suddenly
remembered
more
i
was
so
happy
i
remembered
what
i
had
left
to
come
among
men
and
women
i
knew
that
fillery
and
you
belonged
with
me
you
both
had
come
down
for
a
little
time
come
down
but
had
remained
too
long
you
had
become
almost
as
men
and
women
are
i
remembered
everything
when
i
saw
your
eyes
i
was
so
happy
in
a
moment
as
i
looked
at
you
that
i
felt
i
must
go
back
go
home
the
central
fire
called
me
called
us
all
three
i
wanted
to
escape
and
take
you
with
me
i
knew
by
your
eyes
that
you
were
ready
you
called
to
fillery
we
were
off
he
paused
a
moment
while
she
listened
in
breathless
silence
then
suddenly
you
refused
you
resisted
something
prevented
the
messengers
were
there
when
suddenly
an
expression
of
yearning
pain
clouded
his
great
eyes
a
moment
you
forgot
again
i
forgot
too
forgot
everything
the
darkness
came
it
was
cold
my
enemy
the
water
caught
me
he
stopped
and
passed
his
hands
across
his
forehead
sighing
his
eyes
fixed
upon
vacancy
as
with
an
intense
effort
to
recover
something
and
i
still
forget
he
went
on
the
yearning
now
transferred
from
the
eyes
to
the
lowered
voice
i
can
remember
nothing
again
all
all
is
gone
from
me
the
light
in
his
face
actually
grew
dimmer
as
he
slowly
uttered
the
words
he
leaned
back
in
his
big
again
it
occurred
to
her
it
was
as
if
he
drew
back
from
that
window
in
the
sky
a
curious
hollow
empty
of
life
seemed
to
drop
into
the
room
between
them
as
his
voice
ceased
while
he
had
been
speaking
the
girl
watched
and
listened
with
intense
interest
and
curiosity
she
remembered
he
was
a
patient
yet
no
touch
of
uneasiness
or
nervousness
was
in
her
his
strange
words
meaningless
as
they
might
seem
woke
deep
echoes
of
some
dim
buried
recognition
in
her
it
amazed
and
troubled
her
this
young
man
this
sinner
against
the
conventions
whom
she
had
come
to
comfort
and
forgive
held
the
reins
already
what
had
happened
what
was
happening
and
how
did
he
contrive
it
she
was
aware
of
a
clear
divining
knowledge
in
him
a
power
a
directness
she
could
not
fathom
he
seemed
to
read
her
inside
out
it
was
more
than
uncanny
it
was
spiritual
it
mastered
her
during
his
speech
he
remained
very
still
without
gesture
without
change
of
expression
in
his
face
he
made
no
movement
only
his
voice
deepened
and
grew
rhythmical
and
a
power
emanated
from
him
she
hardly
dared
resist
much
less
deny
his
voice
his
words
reached
depths
in
her
she
scarcely
knew
herself
he
was
so
strong
so
humble
so
simple
yet
so
strangely
peaceful
and
suddenly
she
realized
it
so
far
beyond
her
yet
akin
she
became
aware
that
the
figure
seated
in
the
chair
watching
her
talking
was
but
a
fraction
of
his
whole
self
he
was
the
word
occurred
to
her
immense
was
she
too
immense
more
than
troubled
she
was
profoundly
stimulated
the
mothering
instinct
in
her
for
the
first
time
seemed
to
fail
a
little
the
woman
in
her
trembled
not
quite
sure
of
itself
but
besides
these
two
there
was
another
part
of
her
that
listened
and
felt
joy
a
white
radiant
joy
which
if
she
allowed
must
become
ecstasy
whence
came
this
hint
of
unearthly
rapture
again
there
rose
before
her
the
two
significant
words
there
and
here
i
do
not
quite
understand
she
replied
after
a
moment
pause
looking
into
his
eyes
steadily
her
voice
firm
her
young
face
very
sweet
i
do
not
fully
understand
perhaps
but
i
sympathize
then
she
added
suddenly
with
a
little
smile
but
at
any
rate
i
did
not
come
to
make
you
apologize
julian
please
be
sure
of
that
i
came
to
see
if
i
might
be
of
any
use
if
there
was
anything
i
might
do
to
make
his
quick
interruption
transfixed
her
you
came
he
said
in
a
distinct
low
tone
because
you
love
me
and
wish
me
to
love
you
but
we
do
love
already
you
dear
fillery
and
i
only
our
love
is
in
that
great
service
where
we
all
three
belong
it
is
not
of
this
it
is
not
making
an
impatient
gesture
with
his
hand
to
indicate
his
general
surroundings
he
broke
off
instantly
noticing
the
expression
in
her
face
she
had
realized
suddenly
as
he
spoke
the
blind
fury
of
reproduction
that
sweeps
helpless
men
and
women
everywhere
into
union
then
flings
them
aside
exhausted
useless
its
purpose
accomplished
though
herself
never
yet
caught
by
it
the
vivid
realization
made
her
turn
from
life
with
pity
and
revulsion
yet
were
these
thoughts
her
own
whence
did
they
come
if
not
and
what
was
this
new
blind
thing
straining
in
her
mind
for
utterance
bursting
upwards
like
a
flame
threatening
to
split
it
asunder
even
in
its
efforts
to
escape
what
are
these
words
we
use
darted
across
her
what
do
they
mean
what
is
it
talking
about
i
do
know
quite
yet
it
real
yes
real
and
true
only
it
beyond
our
words
it
something
i
know
but
have
forgotten
that
was
word
again
forgotten
while
they
used
words
together
something
in
her
went
stumbling
groping
thrusting
towards
a
great
shining
revelation
for
which
no
words
existed
and
a
strange
deep
anguish
seized
her
suddenly
oh
he
cried
i
make
you
suffer
again
the
fire
leaves
you
you
are
white
i
i
will
apologize
he
slipped
on
to
his
knees
before
her
but
you
do
not
understand
it
was
not
your
sacredness
i
spoke
of
already
on
his
knees
before
her
but
level
with
her
face
owing
to
his
great
stature
gazing
into
her
eyes
with
an
expression
of
deep
tenderness
humility
almost
suffering
he
added
it
was
our
other
love
i
meant
our
great
happy
service
the
thing
we
have
forgotten
you
came
i
thought
to
help
me
to
remember
the
way
home
i
saw
you
knew
the
light
streamed
back
into
his
face
and
eyes
the
tumult
and
confusion
in
the
girl
were
natural
enough
her
resourcefulness
however
did
not
fail
her
at
this
curious
and
awkward
moment
his
words
his
conduct
were
more
than
she
could
fathom
yet
behind
both
she
divined
a
source
of
remote
inspiration
she
had
never
known
before
in
any
man
the
beauty
and
innocence
on
the
face
arrested
her
faculties
for
a
second
that
nameless
emotion
stirred
again
a
glimmer
of
some
faint
distant
light
whose
origin
she
could
not
guess
passed
flickering
across
her
inner
tumult
some
faculty
she
could
not
name
at
any
rate
blew
suddenly
to
white
heat
in
her
this
youth
on
his
knees
before
her
had
spoken
truth
without
knowing
it
even
herself
she
had
given
him
her
love
a
virgin
love
a
woman
love
hitherto
unawakened
in
her
by
any
other
man
but
a
love
not
of
this
earth
quite
because
of
him
who
summoned
it
into
sudden
flower
yet
at
the
same
time
he
denied
the
need
of
it
he
spoke
of
some
marvellous
great
shining
service
that
was
different
from
the
love
of
man
and
woman
this
too
as
some
forgotten
lost
ideal
she
knew
was
also
true
her
mind
her
heart
her
experience
her
deepest
womanly
nature
these
she
realized
in
a
glowing
instant
of
extraordinary
divination
were
at
variance
in
her
she
trembled
she
knew
not
what
to
do
or
say
or
think
and
again
it
came
to
her
that
the
visible
shape
before
her
was
but
the
insignificant
fraction
of
a
being
whose
true
life
spread
actively
and
unconfined
through
infinite
space
she
then
did
something
that
was
prompted
though
she
did
not
know
it
thus
by
her
singleness
of
heart
her
purity
of
soul
and
body
her
unique
and
natural
instinct
to
be
of
use
of
service
to
others
the
accumulated
practice
and
effort
of
her
entire
life
provided
the
action
along
a
natural
line
of
least
resistance
she
bent
down
and
put
her
arm
and
hand
round
his
great
shoulder
she
lowered
her
face
she
kissed
him
most
tenderly
with
a
mother
love
a
woman
secret
passion
perhaps
but
yet
with
something
else
as
well
she
could
not
name
an
unearthly
yearning
for
a
greater
ideal
than
anything
she
had
yet
known
on
earth
among
humanity
it
was
the
invisible
she
kissed
and
levallon
she
realized
with
immense
relief
justified
her
action
for
he
did
not
return
the
kiss
at
the
same
time
she
had
known
quite
well
it
would
be
thus
that
kiss
trembled
echoed
in
her
own
greater
unrealized
self
as
well
what
is
it
she
whispered
a
mysterious
passion
surging
up
in
her
as
she
raised
him
to
his
feet
that
you
remember
and
wish
to
recover
for
us
all
can
you
tell
me
what
is
this
great
happy
deathless
service
that
we
have
forgotten
her
voice
trembled
a
little
an
immense
sense
of
joy
of
liberty
shook
out
its
sunlit
wings
his
expression
as
he
rose
was
something
between
that
of
a
child
and
a
faithful
yearning
animal
but
of
a
divine
animal
though
she
did
not
know
the
phrase
its
purity
its
sweetness
its
power
it
was
the
power
she
noticed
chiefly
were
superb
i
can
not
tell
i
can
not
remember
his
voice
said
softly
for
all
its
resonant
virile
depth
it
is
some
state
we
all
have
come
from
into
this
we
are
strangers
here
this
brain
and
intellect
this
coarse
thick
feeling
this
selfishness
this
want
of
harmony
and
working
together
all
this
is
new
and
strange
to
us
it
is
of
blind
and
clumsy
children
this
love
of
one
single
person
for
one
other
single
person
it
is
so
pitiful
we
three
have
come
into
this
for
a
time
a
little
time
it
is
pain
and
misery
it
is
prison
each
one
works
only
for
himself
there
is
no
joy
they
know
nothing
of
our
great
service
we
can
not
show
them
let
us
go
back
another
pause
fell
between
them
another
of
those
singular
hollows
she
had
felt
before
but
this
time
the
hollow
was
not
empty
it
was
brimmed
with
surging
life
the
gulf
between
her
earthly
state
and
another
that
was
nameless
a
gulf
usually
unbridgeable
the
fixed
gulf
as
an
old
book
has
it
which
may
not
be
crossed
without
danger
to
the
race
for
whose
protection
it
exists
this
childhood
simile
occurred
to
her
and
a
sense
of
awe
stirred
in
her
being
it
was
the
realization
that
this
gulf
or
hollow
now
brimmed
with
life
that
it
could
be
crossed
that
she
might
step
over
into
another
place
the
sense
of
awe
rose
thence
yet
came
certainly
neither
from
the
woman
nor
the
mother
in
her
i
am
of
another
place
levallon
went
on
plucking
the
thought
naked
from
her
inmost
being
for
i
am
come
here
recently
and
the
purpose
of
my
coming
is
hidden
from
me
and
memory
is
dark
but
it
is
not
entirely
dark
sometimes
i
half
remember
stars
flowers
fire
wind
women
here
and
there
bring
light
into
the
darkness
oh
he
cried
suddenly
how
wonderful
they
are
how
wonderful
you
are
on
that
account
to
me
the
voice
held
a
strange
evoking
power
perhaps
a
thousand
yearnings
she
had
all
her
life
suppressed
because
they
interfered
with
her
duty
as
she
conceived
it
here
and
now
fluttered
like
rising
flames
within
her
as
she
listened
his
voice
now
increased
in
volume
and
rhythm
though
still
quiet
and
it
was
as
if
a
great
wind
poured
behind
it
with
tremendous
vibrations
through
it
lifting
her
out
of
a
limited
cramped
everyday
self
a
delicious
warmth
of
happy
comfort
of
acceptance
of
enthusiasm
glowed
in
her
and
face
she
saw
had
become
radiant
almost
as
though
it
emanated
light
this
light
entered
her
being
and
brought
joy
again
joy
he
said
reading
her
thought
and
feeling
joy
joy
another
place
she
heard
herself
repeating
her
eyes
now
fixed
upon
his
own
she
felt
lighter
caught
up
and
away
a
little
lifted
above
the
solid
earth
as
if
it
was
heat
that
lightened
and
wind
that
bore
her
upwards
everything
in
her
became
intensified
another
state
another
place
her
voice
seemed
to
borrow
something
of
the
rhythm
in
his
own
though
she
did
not
notice
it
but
not
away
from
earth
this
beautiful
earth
with
a
happy
smile
she
added
i
love
the
dear
kind
earth
i
love
it
the
light
on
his
face
increased
the
earth
we
love
and
serve
he
said
is
beautiful
but
here
he
looked
about
him
round
the
room
at
the
trees
waving
through
the
window
at
the
misty
sky
above
draping
the
pale
light
of
the
sun
here
i
am
on
the
surface
only
there
is
confusion
and
struggle
everything
quarrels
against
everything
else
it
is
discord
and
disorder
there
is
no
harmony
here
on
the
surface
everything
is
separate
there
is
no
working
together
it
is
all
pain
each
little
part
fighting
for
itself
here
i
am
outside
there
is
no
joy
it
was
the
phrase
i
am
outside
that
flashed
something
more
of
his
meaning
into
her
his
full
meaning
lay
beyond
actual
words
perhaps
but
this
phrase
fell
like
a
shock
into
that
inmost
self
which
she
had
deliberately
put
away
are
from
yes
she
exclaimed
marvelling
afterwards
that
she
had
said
it
within
nearer
to
the
centre
and
he
took
the
abrupt
interruption
as
though
they
both
understood
and
spoke
of
the
same
one
thing
together
having
found
a
language
born
of
similar
great
yearnings
and
of
forgotten
knowledge
times
states
conditions
places
i
come
he
said
his
voice
his
bright
smile
alive
with
the
pressure
of
untold
desire
from
another
place
that
is
yes
inside
nearer
to
the
centre
i
have
forgotten
almost
everything
i
remember
only
that
there
was
harmony
love
work
and
happiness
all
combined
in
the
perfect
liberty
of
our
great
service
we
served
the
earth
we
helped
the
life
upon
it
there
was
no
end
no
broken
fragments
no
failure
the
voice
touched
chanting
there
was
no
death
he
rose
suddenly
and
came
over
to
her
side
and
instinctively
the
girl
stood
up
what
she
felt
and
thought
as
she
heard
the
strange
language
he
used
she
hardly
knew
herself
she
only
knew
in
that
moment
an
immense
desire
to
help
her
kind
an
intensification
of
that
great
ideal
of
impersonal
service
which
had
always
been
the
keynote
of
her
life
this
became
vividly
stimulated
in
her
it
rose
like
a
dominating
overmastering
passion
the
sense
of
ineffectual
impotence
of
inability
to
accomplish
anything
of
value
against
the
stolid
odds
life
set
against
her
the
uselessness
of
her
efforts
with
the
majority
in
a
word
seemed
brushed
away
as
though
greater
powers
of
limitless
extent
were
now
at
last
within
her
reach
this
blazed
in
her
like
fire
it
shone
in
her
big
dark
eyes
that
looked
straight
into
his
as
they
stood
facing
one
another
and
that
service
he
went
on
in
his
deep
vibrating
tone
i
see
in
dear
fillery
and
in
you
i
know
my
own
kind
we
three
at
least
belong
i
know
my
own
the
voice
seemed
to
shake
her
like
a
wind
at
the
last
two
words
her
soul
leaped
within
her
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
his
great
arm
should
take
her
breast
and
shoulder
and
that
his
lips
should
touch
her
cheek
and
hair
for
there
was
worship
in
both
gestures
our
greater
service
she
whispered
trembling
tell
me
of
that
what
is
it
his
touch
against
her
was
like
the
breath
of
fire
her
womanly
instincts
her
maternal
love
her
feminine
impulses
deserted
her
she
was
aware
solely
at
that
moment
of
the
proximity
of
a
being
who
called
her
to
a
higher
to
at
any
rate
a
different
state
to
something
beyond
the
impoverished
conditions
of
humanity
as
she
had
hitherto
experienced
it
to
something
she
had
ever
yearned
and
longed
for
without
knowing
what
it
was
an
extraordinary
sense
of
enormous
liberty
swept
over
her
again
his
voice
broke
and
the
rhythm
failed
i
can
not
tell
you
he
replied
mournfully
the
light
fading
a
little
from
his
eyes
and
face
i
have
forgotten
that
other
place
is
hidden
from
me
i
am
in
exile
he
added
slowly
but
with
you
and
fillery
his
blue
eyes
filled
with
moisture
the
expression
of
troubled
loneliness
was
one
she
had
never
seen
before
on
any
human
face
i
suffer
he
added
gently
we
all
suffer
and
at
the
sight
of
it
the
yearning
to
help
to
comfort
to
fulfil
her
rôle
as
mother
returned
confusingly
and
rose
in
her
like
a
tide
he
was
so
big
and
strong
and
splendid
he
was
so
helpless
it
was
perhaps
the
innocence
in
the
great
blue
eyes
that
conquered
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
but
behind
beside
the
mother
in
her
stirred
also
the
natural
woman
and
beyond
this
again
rose
the
accumulated
power
of
the
entire
race
the
instinct
of
all
the
women
of
the
planet
since
the
world
began
drove
at
her
not
easily
may
an
individual
escape
the
deep
slavery
of
the
herd
the
young
girl
wavered
and
hesitated
caught
by
so
many
emotions
that
whirled
her
as
in
a
vortex
the
direction
of
the
resultant
impetus
hung
doubtful
for
some
time
during
the
half
hour
talk
she
had
entered
deeper
water
than
she
had
ever
dared
or
known
before
life
hitherto
so
far
as
men
were
concerned
had
been
a
simple
and
an
easy
thing
that
she
had
mastered
without
difficulty
her
real
self
lay
still
unscarred
within
her
freely
she
had
given
the
mothering
care
and
sympathy
that
were
so
strong
in
her
the
more
freely
because
the
men
who
asked
of
her
were
children
one
and
all
children
who
needed
her
but
from
whom
she
asked
nothing
in
return
if
they
fell
in
love
as
they
usually
did
she
knew
exactly
how
to
lift
their
emotion
in
a
way
that
saved
them
pain
while
it
left
herself
untouched
none
reached
her
real
being
which
thus
remained
unscathed
for
none
offered
the
lifting
glory
that
she
craved
here
for
the
first
time
facing
her
stood
a
being
of
another
type
and
that
unscathed
self
in
her
went
trembling
at
the
knowledge
here
was
a
power
she
could
not
play
with
could
not
dominate
but
a
power
that
could
play
with
her
as
easily
as
the
hurricane
with
the
flying
leaf
it
was
not
his
words
his
strange
beauty
his
great
strength
that
mastered
her
though
these
brought
their
contribution
doubtless
the
power
she
felt
emanated
unconsciously
from
him
and
was
used
unconsciously
it
was
all
about
him
she
realized
herself
a
child
before
him
and
this
realization
sweetened
though
it
confused
her
being
he
so
easily
touched
depths
in
her
she
had
hardly
recognized
herself
he
could
so
easily
lift
her
to
terrific
heights
various
sides
of
her
became
dominant
in
turn
the
inmost
tumult
of
a
good
woman
heart
is
not
given
to
men
to
read
perhaps
but
the
final
impetus
resulting
from
the
whirlpool
tossed
her
at
length
in
a
very
definite
direction
she
found
her
feet
again
the
determining
factor
that
decided
the
issue
of
the
struggle
was
a
small
and
very
human
one
he
appealed
to
the
woman
in
her
yet
what
stirred
the
woman
was
the
vital
and
afflicting
factor
that
he
did
not
need
her
he
wished
to
help
to
lift
her
towards
some
impersonal
ideal
that
remained
his
secret
he
wished
to
he
could
give
while
she
for
her
part
had
nothing
that
he
needed
indeed
he
asked
for
nothing
he
was
as
independent
of
her
as
she
was
independent
of
these
other
men
and
the
woman
now
faced
for
the
first
time
with
this
entirely
new
situation
decided
automatically
that
he
should
learn
to
need
her
he
must
though
she
had
nothing
that
he
wanted
from
her
she
must
on
that
very
account
give
all
the
sacrifice
which
stands
ready
for
the
fire
in
every
true
feminine
heart
was
lighted
there
and
then
she
had
found
her
master
and
her
god
half
measures
were
not
possible
to
her
she
stood
naked
at
the
altar
but
in
her
sacrifice
he
too
the
priest
the
deity
the
master
he
also
should
find
love
such
is
the
woman
power
however
to
conceal
from
herself
the
truth
that
she
did
not
recognize
at
first
what
this
decision
was
she
disguised
it
from
her
own
heart
yet
quite
honestly
she
loved
him
and
gave
him
all
she
had
to
give
for
ever
and
ever
even
though
he
did
not
ask
nor
need
her
love
this
she
grasped
her
rôle
must
be
one
of
selfless
sacrifice
but
the
deliberate
purpose
behind
her
real
decision
she
disguised
from
herself
with
complete
success
it
lay
there
none
the
less
strong
vital
very
simple
she
would
teach
him
love
alone
of
all
men
edward
fillery
could
have
drawn
up
this
motive
from
its
inmost
hiding
place
in
her
deep
subconscious
being
and
have
made
it
clear
to
her
fillery
had
he
been
present
would
have
discerned
it
in
her
as
indeed
he
did
discern
it
later
he
had
for
that
matter
already
felt
its
prophecy
with
a
sinking
heart
when
he
planned
bringing
them
together
iraida
might
suffer
at
levallon
hands
but
fillery
apparently
was
not
present
and
nayan
khilkoff
remained
unaware
of
levallon
needs
your
care
and
sympathy
you
can
help
him
she
remembered
this
she
believed
and
love
did
the
rest
so
intricate
so
complex
were
the
emotions
in
her
that
she
realized
one
thing
only
she
must
give
all
without
thought
of
self
when
half
gods
go
the
gods
arrive
sang
in
her
heart
she
was
a
woman
one
of
a
mighty
and
innumerable
multitude
and
collective
instinct
urged
her
irresistibly
but
it
hid
at
the
same
time
with
lovely
care
the
imperishable
desire
and
intention
that
the
arriving
god
should
love
her
in
return
the
youth
stood
facing
her
while
this
tumult
surged
within
her
heart
and
mind
outwardly
calm
she
still
gazed
into
the
clear
blue
eyes
that
shone
with
moisture
as
he
repeated
half
to
himself
and
half
to
her
we
are
in
exile
here
we
suffer
we
have
forgotten
his
hands
were
stretched
towards
her
and
she
took
them
in
her
own
and
held
them
a
moment
but
you
and
i
he
went
on
you
and
i
and
fillery
shall
remember
again
soon
we
shall
know
why
we
are
here
we
shall
do
our
happy
work
together
here
we
shall
then
return
escape
his
deep
tones
filled
the
air
at
the
sound
of
the
other
name
a
breath
of
sadness
of
disappointment
touched
her
coldly
the
familiar
name
had
faded
it
was
as
always
dear
but
its
potency
had
dimmed
the
sun
was
down
and
a
soft
dusk
covered
all
a
faint
wind
rustled
in
the
garden
trees
through
the
open
window
fillery
she
murmured
edward
fillery
he
loved
me
he
has
loved
me
always
the
little
words
they
sounded
little
for
the
first
time
she
uttered
almost
in
a
whisper
that
went
lost
against
the
figure
of
levallon
towering
above
her
through
the
twilight
we
are
together
his
great
voice
caught
her
whisper
in
the
immense
vibration
drowning
it
the
love
of
our
happy
impersonal
service
brings
us
all
together
we
have
forgotten
but
we
shall
remember
soon
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
shone
now
in
the
dusky
air
light
came
about
his
face
and
shoulders
an
immense
vitality
poured
into
her
through
his
hands
the
sense
of
strange
kinship
was
overpowering
she
felt
though
not
in
terms
of
size
or
physical
strength
a
pigmy
before
him
while
yet
another
thing
rose
in
gigantic
and
limitless
glory
as
from
some
inner
heart
he
quickened
in
her
this
sense
of
exaltation
of
delirious
joy
that
tempted
sweetly
came
upon
her
he
love
her
need
her
in
the
end
julian
she
murmured
softly
drawn
irresistibly
closer
the
gods
have
brought
you
to
me
her
feet
went
nearer
of
their
own
accord
but
there
was
no
movement
no
answering
pressure
in
the
hands
she
held
you
shall
never
know
loneliness
again
never
while
i
am
here
the
gods
your
gods
have
brought
us
together
gods
she
heard
his
answer
are
the
same
the
words
trembled
against
her
actual
breast
so
close
she
was
now
leaning
against
him
even
if
lost
it
is
they
who
sent
us
here
i
know
their
messengers
he
broke
off
standing
back
from
her
dropping
her
hands
or
rather
drawing
his
own
away
hark
he
cried
the
voice
deep
and
full
yet
without
loudness
thrilled
her
she
watched
him
with
terror
and
amazement
as
he
turned
to
the
open
window
throwing
his
arms
out
suddenly
to
the
darkening
sky
against
which
the
trees
loomed
still
and
shapeless
his
figure
was
wrapped
in
a
faint
radiance
as
of
silvery
moonlight
she
was
aware
of
heat
about
her
a
comforting
inspiring
warmth
that
pervaded
her
whole
being
as
from
within
the
same
moment
the
bulk
of
the
big
tree
shook
and
trembled
and
a
steady
wind
came
pouring
into
the
room
it
seemed
to
her
the
wind
the
heat
poured
through
that
tree
and
the
inner
heart
in
her
grew
clear
an
instant
this
wind
this
heat
increased
her
being
marvellously
the
exaltation
in
her
swept
out
and
free
she
saw
him
dropped
from
alien
skies
upon
the
little
teeming
earth
the
sense
of
his
remoteness
from
the
life
about
them
of
her
own
remoteness
too
flashed
over
her
like
wind
and
fire
an
immense
ideal
blazed
then
vanished
it
flamed
beyond
her
grasp
it
beckoned
with
imperishable
loveliness
then
faded
instantly
wind
caught
it
up
once
more
with
the
fire
an
overpowering
joy
rose
in
her
julian
she
cried
aloud
son
of
wind
and
fire
at
the
words
which
had
come
to
her
instinctively
he
turned
with
a
sudden
gesture
she
could
not
quite
interpret
while
there
broke
upon
his
face
a
smile
strange
and
lovely
that
caught
up
the
effect
of
light
about
him
and
seemed
to
focus
in
his
brilliant
eyes
his
happiness
was
beyond
all
question
his
admiration
wonder
too
yet
the
quality
she
chiefly
looked
and
expected
was
there
she
chilled
the
joy
she
was
acutely
conscious
was
not
a
personal
joy
you
he
said
gently
happily
emphasizing
the
word
you
are
not
pitiful
and
the
rustle
of
the
shaking
trees
outside
the
window
merged
their
voice
in
his
and
carried
it
outward
into
space
it
was
as
if
the
wind
itself
had
spoken
across
the
garden
dusk
there
shot
a
sudden
effect
of
light
as
though
a
flame
had
flickered
somewhere
in
the
sky
then
passed
back
into
the
growing
night
there
was
a
scent
of
flowers
in
the
air
you
he
cried
with
an
exultation
that
carried
her
again
beyond
herself
you
are
not
pitiful
julian
she
stammered
longing
for
his
arms
she
half
drew
away
the
blood
flowed
down
and
back
in
her
not
pitiful
she
repeated
faintly
for
it
was
to
her
suddenly
as
if
that
sighing
wind
that
entered
the
room
from
the
outer
sky
had
borne
him
away
from
her
that
wind
was
a
messenger
it
came
from
that
distant
state
that
other
region
where
he
belonged
a
state
a
region
compared
to
which
the
beings
of
earth
were
trumpery
and
it
came
to
remind
him
of
his
home
and
origin
the
little
earth
the
myriad
confused
figures
struggling
together
on
its
surface
he
saw
as
pitiful
from
that
window
in
the
sky
whence
he
looked
down
he
watched
them
she
knew
the
feeling
in
him
knew
it
because
some
part
of
her
though
faint
and
deeply
hidden
was
akin
yet
she
was
not
wholly
pitiful
he
had
discerned
in
her
this
faint
hidden
strain
of
vaster
life
had
stirred
and
strengthened
it
by
his
words
his
presence
yet
it
was
not
vital
enough
in
her
to
stand
alone
when
wind
and
fire
his
elements
breathed
forth
from
it
she
was
afraid
you
are
not
pitiful
he
had
said
yet
pitiful
for
all
that
she
knew
herself
to
be
on
that
breath
of
sighing
wind
he
swept
away
from
her
far
far
away
where
as
yet
she
could
not
follow
and
her
dream
of
personal
love
swept
with
it
some
ineffable
hint
of
a
divine
impersonal
glory
she
had
known
went
with
him
from
her
heart
the
personal
was
too
strong
in
her
it
was
human
love
she
desired
both
to
give
and
ask
unspoken
words
flared
through
her
heart
and
being
julian
you
have
no
soul
no
human
soul
but
i
will
give
you
one
for
i
will
teach
you
love
he
turned
upon
her
like
a
hurricane
of
windy
fire
soul
he
cried
catching
the
word
out
of
her
naked
heart
oh
be
not
caught
with
that
pitiful
delusion
it
is
this
idea
of
soul
that
binds
you
hopelessly
to
selfish
ends
and
broken
purposes
this
thing
you
call
soul
is
but
the
dream
of
human
vanity
and
egoism
it
is
worse
than
love
both
bind
you
endlessly
to
limited
desires
and
blind
ambitions
they
are
of
children
he
rose
like
some
pillar
of
whirling
flame
and
wind
beside
her
come
out
with
me
he
cried
come
back
you
teach
me
to
remember
our
elemental
home
calls
sweetly
to
us
our
elemental
service
waits
we
belong
to
those
vast
powers
they
are
eternal
they
know
no
binding
and
they
have
no
death
their
only
law
is
service
that
mighty
service
which
builds
up
the
universe
the
stars
are
with
us
the
nebulæ
and
the
central
fires
are
their
throne
and
altar
the
soul
you
dream
of
in
your
little
circle
is
but
an
idle
dream
of
the
race
that
ties
your
feet
lest
you
should
fly
and
soar
the
personal
has
bandaged
all
your
eyes
nayan
come
back
with
me
you
once
worked
with
me
there
you
i
and
fillery
together
his
voice
though
low
had
that
which
was
terrific
in
it
the
volume
of
its
sound
appalled
her
its
low
vibrations
shook
her
heart
soul
she
said
very
softly
courage
sure
in
her
but
tears
close
in
her
burning
eyes
is
my
only
hope
i
live
for
it
i
am
ready
to
die
for
it
it
is
my
life
he
gazed
at
her
a
moment
with
a
tenderness
and
sympathy
she
hardly
understood
for
their
origin
lay
hidden
beyond
her
comprehension
she
knew
one
thing
only
that
he
looked
adorable
and
glorious
a
being
brought
by
the
wise
powers
of
life
whatever
these
might
be
into
the
keeping
of
her
love
and
care
the
mother
and
the
woman
merged
in
her
his
redemption
lay
within
her
gentle
hands
if
it
lay
at
the
same
time
upon
an
altar
that
was
her
awful
sacrifice
son
of
wind
and
fire
she
cried
though
emotion
made
her
voice
dwindle
to
a
breathless
whisper
you
called
to
my
love
yet
my
love
is
personal
i
have
nothing
else
to
give
you
julian
come
back
o
stay
with
me
your
wind
and
fire
frighten
for
they
take
you
away
service
i
know
but
your
service
o
what
is
it
for
it
leaves
the
bed
the
hearthstone
cold
she
stopped
abruptly
wondering
suddenly
at
her
own
words
what
was
this
rhythm
that
had
caught
her
mind
and
heart
into
an
unknown
a
daring
form
of
speech
but
the
wind
ran
again
through
the
open
window
fluttering
the
curtains
and
the
skirts
about
her
feet
it
sighed
and
whispered
it
was
no
earthly
wind
she
saw
him
once
again
go
from
her
on
its
quiet
wings
he
left
her
side
he
left
her
heart
and
an
icy
realization
of
loneliness
his
exile
stirred
in
her
for
a
moment
as
she
looked
up
into
his
shining
face
silhouetted
in
the
dusk
against
the
window
there
rose
tumultuously
in
her
that
maternal
feeling
which
had
held
all
men
safely
at
a
distance
hitherto
like
a
wave
it
mastered
her
she
longed
to
take
him
in
her
arms
to
shield
him
from
a
world
that
was
not
his
to
bless
and
comfort
him
with
all
she
had
to
give
to
have
the
right
to
brush
that
wondrous
hair
to
open
those
lids
at
dawn
and
close
them
with
a
kiss
at
night
this
ancient
passion
rose
in
her
bringing
though
she
did
not
recognize
it
the
great
woman
in
its
train
she
walked
up
to
him
with
both
hands
outstretched
all
my
nights
she
said
with
no
reddening
of
the
cheek
are
as
our
wedding
night
he
heard
he
saw
but
the
words
held
no
meaning
for
him
julian
stay
with
me
stay
here
she
put
her
arms
about
him
and
forget
he
cried
an
inexpressible
longing
in
his
voice
he
bent
none
the
less
beneath
the
pressure
of
her
clinging
arms
he
lowered
his
face
to
hers
i
will
teach
you
love
she
murmured
her
cheek
against
his
own
you
do
not
know
how
sweet
how
wonderful
it
is
all
your
strange
wisdom
you
shall
show
me
and
i
will
learn
willingly
if
only
i
may
teach
you
love
you
would
teach
me
to
forget
he
said
in
a
voice
of
curious
pain
just
as
you
are
forgetting
now
he
gently
unclasped
her
hands
from
about
his
neck
and
went
over
to
the
open
window
while
she
sank
into
a
chair
watching
him
she
again
heard
the
wind
but
again
no
common
earthly
wind
go
singing
past
the
walls
but
will
teach
you
to
remember
he
said
his
great
figure
half
turning
towards
her
again
his
voice
sounding
as
though
it
were
in
that
sighing
breath
of
wind
that
passed
and
died
away
into
the
silence
of
the
sky
the
strange
difficulty
the
immensity
of
her
task
grew
suddenly
crystal
clear
in
her
mind
amid
the
whirling
aching
pain
and
yearning
that
she
felt
it
stood
forth
sharp
and
definite
it
was
imperious
she
loved
and
she
must
teach
love
this
was
the
one
thing
needful
in
his
case
her
own
deep
selfless
heart
would
guide
her
there
was
pain
in
her
but
there
was
no
fear
above
the
conventions
she
felt
herself
naked
and
unashamed
the
sense
of
a
new
immense
liberty
he
had
brought
lifted
her
into
a
region
where
she
could
be
natural
without
offence
he
had
flung
wide
the
gates
of
life
setting
free
those
strange
ultimate
powers
which
had
lain
hidden
and
unrealized
hitherto
and
with
them
was
quickened
too
that
mysterious
and
awful
hint
which
beckoning
ever
towards
some
vaster
life
had
made
the
world
as
she
found
it
unsatisfactory
pale
of
meagre
value
as
the
strange
drift
of
wind
passed
off
into
the
sky
she
moved
across
the
room
and
stood
beside
him
its
dying
chant
still
humming
in
her
ears
that
song
of
the
wind
she
understood
was
symbolic
of
what
she
had
to
fight
for
his
being
though
linked
to
a
divine
service
she
could
not
understand
lay
in
nature
and
apart
from
human
things
think
julian
she
murmured
her
face
against
his
shoulder
so
that
the
sweet
perfume
as
of
flowers
he
exhaled
came
over
her
intoxicatingly
think
what
we
could
do
together
for
the
world
for
all
these
little
striving
ignorant
troubled
people
in
it
for
everybody
you
and
i
together
working
helping
lifting
them
all
up
he
made
no
movement
and
she
took
his
great
arm
and
drew
it
round
her
neck
placing
the
hand
against
her
cheek
he
looked
down
at
her
then
his
eyes
peering
into
her
face
that
he
said
in
a
deep
gentle
voice
that
vibrated
through
her
whole
body
yes
that
we
will
do
it
is
the
service
the
service
of
our
gods
it
is
why
i
called
you
from
the
first
i
saw
it
in
you
and
in
before
he
could
speak
the
name
she
kissed
his
lips
pulling
his
head
lower
in
order
to
reach
them
think
julian
she
whispered
his
eyes
so
close
to
hers
that
they
seemed
to
burn
them
think
what
our
child
might
be
the
wind
came
back
across
the
tossing
trees
with
a
rush
of
singing
her
hair
fluttered
across
their
two
faces
as
it
entered
the
room
drove
round
the
inner
walls
then
with
a
cry
flew
out
again
into
the
empty
sky
she
felt
as
if
the
wind
had
answered
her
for
other
answer
there
came
none
far
away
in
the
spaces
of
that
darkening
sky
the
wind
rushed
sailing
sailing
with
its
impersonal
song
of
power
and
of
triumph
she
did
not
remember
any
further
spoken
words
she
remembered
only
as
she
went
homewards
down
the
street
that
julian
had
opened
the
door
upon
some
unspoken
understanding
that
she
had
lost
him
because
she
dared
not
follow
recklessly
where
he
led
and
that
the
steady
draught
it
seemed
had
driven
forcibly
behind
her
as
though
the
wind
had
blown
her
out
it
was
only
much
later
she
realized
that
the
figure
who
had
then
overtaken
her
supported
comforted
with
kind
ordinary
words
she
hardly
understood
at
the
moment
and
yet
vaguely
welcomed
finally
leaving
her
at
the
door
of
her
father
house
in
chelsea
was
the
figure
of
edward
fillery
chapter
xxiv
as
upon
a
former
occasion
some
hours
before
seemed
hardly
aware
that
his
visitor
had
left
though
this
time
there
was
the
vital
difference
that
what
was
of
value
had
not
gone
at
all
the
essence
of
the
girl
it
seemed
was
still
with
him
it
remained
the
physical
presence
was
to
him
apparently
the
least
of
all
he
returned
to
his
place
at
the
open
window
of
the
darkening
room
while
night
with
her
cooler
airs
passed
over
the
world
on
tiptoe
he
drew
deep
breaths
opened
his
arms
and
seemed
to
shake
himself
as
though
glad
to
be
free
of
recent
little
awkward
and
unnatural
gestures
that
had
irked
him
there
was
happiness
in
his
face
she
is
a
builder
though
she
has
forgotten
ran
his
thought
with
pleasure
and
i
can
work
with
her
like
fillery
she
builds
up
constructs
we
are
all
three
in
the
same
service
and
the
gods
are
glad
i
love
her
yes
but
she
his
thoughts
grew
troubled
and
confused
she
speaks
of
another
love
that
is
a
tight
and
binding
little
thing
that
catches
and
confines
it
is
for
one
person
only
one
person
for
one
other
for
two
only
for
two
persons
what
is
its
meaning
then
of
her
words
and
acts
he
had
understood
evidently
a
small
part
only
much
that
she
had
said
and
done
he
had
not
comprehended
although
in
it
somewhere
there
had
certainly
lain
a
sweet
faint
troubling
pleasure
that
was
new
to
him
his
thought
wavered
flickered
out
and
vanished
for
a
long
time
he
leaned
against
the
window
with
his
images
thinking
with
his
heart
for
when
alone
and
not
stirred
by
the
thinking
of
others
close
to
him
he
became
of
a
curious
childlike
innocence
knowing
nothing
his
thinking
with
others
present
seemed
but
a
reflection
of
thinking
the
way
he
caught
up
the
racial
thinking
appearing
swiftly
intelligent
at
the
time
as
with
fillery
mind
passed
the
instant
he
was
alone
he
became
open
then
to
bigger
rhythms
that
the
little
busy
thinkers
checked
and
interrupted
but
this
greater
flow
of
images
of
rhythms
this
thinking
with
the
heart
what
was
it
and
with
what
things
did
it
deal
he
did
not
know
he
had
forgotten
to
his
present
brain
it
was
alien
he
grasped
only
that
it
was
concerned
with
the
rhythms
of
fire
and
wind
apparently
though
hardly
perhaps
of
that
crude
form
in
which
men
know
them
but
of
an
inner
subtler
more
vital
heat
and
air
which
lie
in
and
behind
all
forms
and
help
to
shape
them
and
of
intelligences
which
use
these
as
their
vehicles
their
instruments
their
bodies
in
his
images
he
was
aware
of
these
intelligences
perceived
them
with
his
entire
being
shared
their
activities
and
nature
behind
all
forms
and
shapes
whether
of
people
flowers
minerals
of
insects
or
of
stars
of
a
bird
a
butterfly
or
a
nebula
but
also
of
those
shapes
which
are
born
of
thought
and
mood
and
heart
this
host
of
intelligences
great
and
small
all
delving
together
building
constructing
involved
in
a
vast
impersonal
service
which
was
deathless
this
seemed
the
mighty
call
that
thundered
through
him
fire
and
wind
merely
the
agencies
with
which
he
in
particular
knew
instinctively
his
duties
lay
for
his
work
these
images
taught
him
was
to
increase
life
by
making
the
body
it
used
as
perfect
as
he
could
the
more
perfect
the
form
the
instrument
the
greater
the
power
manifesting
through
it
a
poor
imperfect
form
stopped
the
flow
of
this
manifesting
life
as
though
a
current
were
held
up
and
delayed
for
instance
his
own
form
his
present
body
now
irked
delayed
and
hampered
him
although
he
knew
not
how
or
why
or
whence
he
had
come
to
be
using
it
at
this
moment
on
the
earth
the
instinctive
desire
to
escape
from
it
lay
in
him
and
also
the
instinctive
recognition
that
two
others
similarly
caught
and
imprisoned
must
escape
with
him
the
images
the
rhythms
poured
through
him
in
a
mighty
flood
as
he
leaned
by
the
open
window
his
great
figure
his
whole
nature
too
merging
in
the
space
the
wind
the
darkness
of
the
night
beyond
yet
darkness
troubled
him
too
it
always
seemed
unfamiliar
new
something
he
had
never
been
accustomed
to
in
darkness
he
became
quiet
very
gentle
feeling
his
way
as
it
were
uneasily
he
was
aware
however
that
fillery
was
near
though
not
perhaps
that
he
was
actually
in
the
room
seated
somewhere
among
the
shadows
watching
him
he
felt
him
close
in
the
same
way
he
felt
the
girl
still
close
whether
distance
between
them
in
space
was
actually
great
or
small
the
essential
in
all
three
was
similar
their
yearnings
hopes
intentions
purposes
were
akin
their
longing
for
some
service
immense
satisfying
it
seemed
connected
them
the
voice
however
did
not
startle
when
it
sounded
behind
him
from
an
apparently
empty
room
the
love
she
spoke
of
you
do
not
understand
of
course
perhaps
you
do
not
need
it
the
voice
as
well
as
the
feeling
that
lay
behind
hardly
disturbed
the
images
and
rhythms
in
their
wondrous
flow
rather
they
seemed
a
part
of
them
turned
he
saw
fillery
distinctly
sitting
motionless
among
the
shadows
by
the
wall
it
is
for
you
a
new
relationship
and
seems
small
cramping
and
unnecessary
what
is
it
asked
what
is
this
love
she
seeks
to
hold
me
with
saying
that
i
need
it
dear
fillery
he
added
moving
nearer
will
you
tell
me
what
it
is
i
found
it
sweet
and
pleasant
yet
i
fear
it
it
is
was
the
reply
in
its
best
form
the
highest
quality
know
ah
i
felt
the
fire
in
it
interrupted
smiling
i
smelt
the
flowers
his
smile
seemed
faintly
luminous
across
the
gloom
because
it
was
the
best
replied
the
other
gently
in
its
best
form
it
means
sometimes
the
complete
sacrifice
of
one
being
for
the
welfare
of
another
there
is
no
self
in
it
at
all
he
felt
the
eyes
of
his
companion
fixed
upon
him
in
the
darkness
of
the
quiet
room
he
felt
likewise
that
he
was
bewildered
and
perplexed
as
for
instance
the
mother
for
her
child
he
went
on
that
is
the
purest
form
of
it
we
know
one
being
feels
it
for
other
only
repeated
apparently
ignoring
the
reference
to
maternal
love
each
wants
the
other
for
himself
each
lives
for
the
other
only
the
rest
excluded
it
is
always
two
and
two
is
that
what
she
means
she
would
not
like
it
if
you
had
the
same
feeling
for
another
woman
fillery
explained
she
would
feel
jealousy
which
means
she
would
grudge
sharing
you
with
another
she
would
resent
it
afraid
of
losing
you
two
and
two
and
two
and
two
the
words
floated
through
the
shadows
the
ideal
seemed
to
shock
and
hurt
him
he
could
not
understand
it
she
asks
for
the
whole
of
me
all
to
herself
it
is
lower
than
insects
flowers
even
it
is
against
nature
so
small
so
separate
but
nature
interrupted
fillery
after
an
interval
of
silence
between
them
is
not
concerned
with
what
we
call
love
she
is
indifferent
to
it
her
purpose
is
merely
the
continuance
of
the
race
and
she
accomplishes
this
by
making
men
and
women
attractive
to
one
another
this
too
he
explained
we
call
love
though
it
is
love
in
its
weakest
least
enduring
form
that
replied
i
know
and
understand
she
builds
the
best
form
she
can
and
once
the
form
is
built
agreed
the
other
and
nature
aim
fulfilled
this
kind
of
love
usually
fades
out
and
dies
it
is
a
physical
thing
entirely
like
the
two
atoms
we
read
about
together
a
few
days
ago
which
rush
together
automatically
to
produce
a
third
thing
he
lowered
his
voice
suddenly
there
was
a
great
teacher
once
he
went
on
who
told
us
that
we
should
love
everybody
everybody
and
that
in
the
real
life
there
was
no
marriage
as
we
call
it
nor
giving
in
marriage
it
seemed
that
as
he
said
the
words
the
darkness
lifted
and
a
faint
perfume
of
flowers
floated
through
the
air
made
no
comment
or
reply
he
sat
still
listening
i
love
her
he
whispered
suddenly
i
love
her
in
way
because
i
want
everybody
else
to
love
her
too
as
i
do
and
as
you
do
but
i
do
not
want
her
for
myself
alone
do
you
you
do
not
of
course
i
feel
you
are
as
i
am
you
are
happy
that
i
love
her
there
is
morality
said
fillery
presently
in
a
low
voice
glad
at
that
moment
of
the
darkness
there
is
what
we
call
morality
tell
me
dear
fillery
what
that
is
is
it
bigger
than
your
fillery
explained
briefly
while
his
companion
listened
intently
making
no
comment
it
was
evidently
as
strange
and
new
to
him
as
human
love
we
have
invented
it
he
added
at
the
end
to
protect
ourselves
our
mothers
our
families
our
children
it
is
you
see
a
set
of
rules
devised
for
the
welfare
of
the
race
for
though
a
few
among
us
do
not
need
such
rules
the
majority
do
it
is
in
a
word
the
acknowledgment
of
the
rights
of
others
it
had
to
be
invented
exclaimed
with
a
sigh
that
seemed
to
trouble
the
darkness
as
with
the
sadness
of
something
he
could
scarcely
believe
and
these
rules
are
needed
still
is
the
race
at
that
stage
only
it
does
not
move
then
into
the
atmosphere
as
the
words
were
audible
stole
again
that
mysterious
sense
of
the
insignificance
of
earth
and
all
its
manifold
activities
human
and
otherwise
and
with
it
too
a
remarkable
breath
of
some
larger
reality
that
lay
shining
just
beyond
all
known
horizons
fillery
shivered
in
spite
of
himself
it
seemed
to
him
for
an
instant
that
the
great
figure
looming
opposite
through
the
darkness
extended
spread
gathering
into
its
increased
proportions
the
sky
the
trees
the
darkened
space
outside
that
it
no
longer
sat
there
quite
alone
he
recalled
his
startling
admission
the
touch
of
panic
terror
slowly
if
at
all
he
said
louder
though
wondering
why
he
raised
his
voice
yet
there
is
progress
he
had
the
feeling
it
would
be
better
to
turn
on
the
light
as
though
this
conversation
and
the
strange
sensations
it
produced
in
him
would
be
impossible
in
a
full
blaze
he
made
a
movement
indeed
to
find
the
switch
it
was
the
sound
of
his
companion
voice
that
made
him
pause
for
the
words
came
at
him
as
though
a
wave
of
heat
moved
through
the
air
he
knew
intuitively
that
the
other
intense
inner
activity
had
increased
he
let
his
hand
drop
he
listened
their
thoughts
he
was
convinced
had
mingled
and
been
mutually
shared
again
there
was
a
faint
sound
like
music
behind
it
we
have
worked
such
a
little
time
as
yet
fell
the
words
into
the
silence
if
only
oh
if
only
i
could
remember
more
a
little
time
thought
fillery
to
himself
knowing
that
the
other
meant
the
millions
of
years
nature
had
used
to
evoke
her
myriad
forms
try
to
remember
he
added
in
a
whisper
what
i
do
remember
i
can
not
even
tell
was
the
reply
the
voice
strangely
deepening
no
words
come
to
me
he
paused
a
moment
then
went
on
i
am
of
the
first
the
oldest
i
know
that
the
earth
was
hot
and
burning
burning
burning
still
it
was
soft
with
heat
when
i
was
summoned
from
from
other
work
just
completed
with
a
vast
host
i
came
our
service
summoned
us
we
began
at
the
beginning
i
am
of
the
oldest
the
earth
was
still
hot
burning
burning
the
voice
failed
suddenly
i
can
not
remember
dear
fillery
i
can
not
remember
it
hurts
me
my
head
pains
our
work
our
service
yes
there
progress
the
ages
as
you
call
them
but
it
is
such
a
little
time
as
yet
the
voice
trailed
off
the
figure
lost
its
suggestion
of
sudden
vastness
the
darkness
emptied
i
am
of
the
oldest
i
remember
only
it
ceased
as
though
it
drifted
out
upon
the
passing
wind
outside
then
you
have
been
working
said
fillery
his
voice
still
almost
a
whisper
you
and
your
great
host
for
thousands
of
years
in
the
service
of
this
planet
he
broke
off
unable
to
find
his
words
it
seemed
since
the
beginning
came
the
steady
answer
years
i
do
not
know
since
the
beginning
yet
we
have
only
just
begun
oh
he
cried
i
can
not
remember
it
is
impossible
it
all
goes
lost
among
my
words
and
in
this
darkness
i
am
confused
and
entangled
with
your
own
little
thinking
i
suffer
with
it
then
suddenly
my
eyes
are
hot
and
wet
dear
fillery
what
happens
to
them
he
stood
up
putting
both
hands
to
his
face
fillery
stood
up
too
he
trembled
do
try
he
said
soothingly
do
not
try
to
remember
any
more
it
will
come
back
to
you
soon
but
it
wo
come
back
by
any
deliberate
effort
he
comforted
him
as
best
he
could
realizing
that
the
curious
dialogue
had
lasted
long
enough
but
he
did
not
produce
a
disconcerting
blaze
by
turning
the
light
on
suddenly
he
led
his
companion
gently
to
the
door
so
that
the
darkness
might
pass
more
gradually
the
lights
in
the
corridor
were
shaded
and
inoffensive
it
was
only
in
the
bedroom
that
he
noticed
the
bright
tears
as
examining
them
with
curious
interest
in
the
mirror
exclaimed
more
to
himself
than
to
fillery
she
had
them
too
i
saw
them
in
her
eyes
when
she
spoke
to
me
of
love
the
love
she
will
teach
me
because
she
said
i
needed
it
tears
said
fillery
his
voice
shaking
they
come
from
feeling
pain
it
is
a
little
thing
returned
smiling
at
himself
then
turning
to
his
friend
his
great
blue
eyes
shining
wonderfully
through
their
moisture
then
she
felt
what
i
felt
we
felt
together
when
she
comes
i
will
show
her
these
tears
and
she
will
be
glad
i
love
and
she
will
bring
tears
of
her
own
and
you
will
have
some
too
and
we
shall
all
love
together
it
is
not
difficult
is
it
not
very
agreed
fillery
smiling
in
his
turn
it
is
not
very
difficult
he
was
again
trembling
she
will
be
happy
that
we
all
love
i
hope
so
it
was
curious
how
easily
tears
came
to
the
eyes
of
this
strange
being
and
for
causes
so
different
that
they
were
not
easy
to
explain
he
did
not
cry
it
was
merely
that
the
hot
tears
welled
up
even
with
devonham
once
it
happened
too
the
lesson
in
natural
history
was
over
devonham
had
just
sketched
the
outline
of
the
various
kingdoms
with
the
animal
kingdom
and
man
position
in
it
according
to
present
evolutionary
knowledge
and
had
then
said
something
about
the
earth
place
in
the
solar
system
and
the
probable
relation
of
this
system
to
the
universe
at
large
an
admirable
view
as
it
were
without
a
hint
of
speculative
imagination
in
it
anywhere
when
after
intent
listening
in
irresponsive
silence
asked
abruptly
what
does
it
believe
then
as
devonham
stared
at
him
a
little
puzzled
at
first
he
repeated
that
is
what
the
race
but
what
does
it
believe
said
devonham
believe
ah
you
mean
what
is
its
religion
its
faith
its
speculations
and
proceeded
to
give
the
briefest
possible
answer
he
felt
consistent
with
his
duty
the
less
his
mind
was
troubled
with
such
matters
the
better
in
his
opinion
and
their
god
the
young
man
inquired
abruptly
as
soon
as
the
recital
was
over
he
had
listened
closely
as
he
always
did
but
without
a
sign
of
interest
merely
waiting
for
the
end
much
as
a
child
who
is
bored
by
a
poor
fairy
tale
yet
wishes
to
know
exactly
how
it
is
all
going
to
finish
they
him
he
leaned
forward
devonham
not
quite
liking
the
form
of
the
question
nor
the
more
eager
manner
accompanying
it
hesitated
a
moment
thinking
perhaps
what
he
ought
to
say
he
did
not
want
this
mind
now
opening
to
be
filled
with
ideas
that
could
be
of
no
use
to
it
nor
help
in
its
formation
least
of
all
did
he
desire
it
to
be
choked
and
troubled
with
the
dead
theology
of
notions
concerning
a
tumbling
personal
deity
creeds
moreover
were
a
matter
of
faith
of
as
he
called
it
being
obviously
divorced
from
any
process
of
reason
he
had
nevertheless
a
question
to
answer
and
a
duty
to
perform
his
hesitation
passed
in
compromise
he
was
as
has
been
seen
too
sincere
too
honest
to
possess
much
sense
of
humour
the
race
he
said
or
rather
that
portion
of
it
into
which
you
have
been
born
believes
on
paper
he
emphasized
the
qualification
in
a
paternal
god
but
its
real
god
the
god
it
worships
is
knowledge
not
a
knowledge
that
exists
for
its
own
sake
he
went
on
blandly
but
that
brings
possessions
power
comfort
and
a
million
needless
accessories
into
life
that
god
it
worships
as
you
see
with
energy
and
zeal
knowledge
and
work
that
shall
result
in
acquisition
in
pleasure
that
is
the
god
of
the
race
on
this
side
of
the
planet
where
you
find
yourself
and
the
god
on
paper
asked
making
no
comment
though
he
had
listened
attentively
and
had
understood
the
god
that
is
written
about
on
paper
and
believed
in
on
paper
the
printed
account
of
this
god
replied
devonham
describes
an
omnipotent
and
perfect
being
who
has
existed
always
he
created
the
planet
and
everything
upon
it
but
created
it
so
imperfectly
that
he
had
to
send
later
a
smaller
god
to
show
how
much
better
he
have
created
us
in
doing
this
he
offered
us
an
extremely
difficult
and
laborious
method
of
improvement
a
method
of
escaping
from
his
own
mistake
but
a
method
so
painful
and
unrealizable
that
it
is
contrary
to
our
very
natures
as
he
made
them
first
he
almost
smacked
his
lips
as
he
said
it
the
big
god
the
first
one
asked
at
once
have
they
seen
and
known
him
have
they
complained
no
said
devonham
they
have
not
those
who
believe
in
him
accept
things
as
he
made
them
and
the
smaller
lesser
god
how
did
he
arrive
came
the
odd
question
he
was
born
like
you
and
me
but
without
a
father
no
male
had
his
mother
ever
known
he
was
recognized
as
a
god
the
pupil
showed
interest
but
no
emotion
much
less
excitement
by
a
few
the
rest
afraid
because
he
told
them
their
possessions
were
worthless
killed
him
quickly
and
the
few
they
obeyed
his
teaching
or
tried
to
and
believed
that
they
would
live
afterwards
for
ever
and
ever
in
happiness
and
the
others
the
many
the
others
according
to
the
few
would
live
afterwards
for
ever
and
ever
in
pain
it
is
a
demon
story
said
smiling
it
is
printed
believed
taught
replied
devonham
by
an
immense
organization
to
millions
of
people
free
inquired
his
pupil
the
teachers
are
paid
but
very
little
the
teachers
believe
it
though
at
least
some
of
them
probably
replied
devonham
after
brief
consideration
and
the
millions
do
they
worship
this
god
they
do
on
paper
yes
they
worship
the
first
big
god
they
go
once
or
twice
a
week
into
special
buildings
dressed
in
their
best
clothes
as
for
a
party
and
pray
and
sing
and
tell
him
he
is
wonderful
and
they
themselves
are
miserable
and
worthless
and
then
ask
him
in
abject
humility
for
all
sorts
of
things
they
want
do
they
get
them
they
ask
for
different
things
you
see
one
wants
fine
weather
for
his
holidays
another
wants
rain
for
his
crops
the
prayers
in
which
they
ask
are
printed
by
the
government
they
ask
for
this
planet
only
this
planet
conceives
itself
alone
inhabited
there
are
no
other
living
beings
anywhere
the
earth
is
the
centre
of
the
universe
the
only
globe
worth
consideration
although
asked
these
quick
questions
his
interest
was
obviously
not
much
engaged
the
first
sharp
attention
having
passed
then
he
looked
fixedly
at
devonham
and
said
with
a
sudden
curious
smile
what
you
say
is
always
dead
i
understand
the
sounds
you
use
but
the
meaning
can
not
get
into
me
inside
i
mean
but
i
thank
you
for
the
sound
there
was
a
moment
pause
during
which
devonham
accustomed
to
strange
remarks
and
comments
from
his
pupil
betrayed
no
sign
of
annoyance
or
displeasure
he
waited
to
see
if
any
further
questions
would
be
forthcoming
he
was
observing
a
phenomenon
his
attitude
was
scientific
but
in
sending
this
lesser
god
resumed
presently
how
did
the
big
one
excuse
himself
he
did
he
told
the
race
it
was
so
worthless
that
nothing
else
could
save
it
he
looked
on
while
the
lesser
god
was
killed
he
is
very
proud
about
it
and
claims
the
thanks
and
worship
of
the
race
because
of
it
the
lesser
god
poor
lesser
god
observed
he
was
bigger
than
the
other
he
thought
a
moment
how
pitiful
he
added
much
bigger
agreed
devonham
pleased
with
his
pupil
acumen
his
voice
even
his
manner
changing
a
little
as
he
continued
for
then
came
the
wonder
of
it
all
the
lesser
god
teachings
were
so
new
and
beautiful
that
the
position
of
the
other
became
untenable
the
race
disowned
him
it
worshipped
the
lesser
one
in
his
place
tell
me
tell
me
please
said
as
though
he
noticed
and
understood
the
change
of
tone
at
once
i
listen
the
dear
fillery
spoke
to
me
of
a
great
teacher
i
feel
a
kind
deep
joy
move
in
me
tell
me
please
again
devonham
hesitated
a
moment
for
he
recognized
signs
that
made
him
ill
at
ease
a
little
because
he
did
not
understand
them
following
a
scientific
textbook
with
his
pupil
was
well
and
good
but
he
had
no
desire
to
trespass
on
what
he
considered
as
fillery
territory
was
his
pupil
not
his
patient
he
had
already
gone
too
far
he
realized
after
a
moment
reflection
however
he
decided
it
was
wiser
to
let
the
talk
run
out
its
natural
course
instead
of
ending
it
abruptly
he
was
as
thorough
as
he
was
sincere
and
whatever
his
own
theories
and
prejudices
might
be
in
this
particular
case
he
would
not
shirk
an
issue
nor
treat
it
with
the
smallest
dishonesty
he
put
the
glasses
straight
on
his
big
nose
the
new
teachings
he
said
were
so
beautiful
that
if
faithfully
practised
by
everybody
the
world
would
soon
become
a
very
different
place
to
what
it
is
did
the
race
practise
them
came
the
question
in
a
voice
that
held
a
note
of
softness
almost
of
wonder
no
why
not
they
were
too
difficult
and
painful
and
uncomfortable
the
new
god
moreover
only
came
here
years
ago
whereas
men
have
existed
on
earth
for
at
least
asked
abruptly
what
the
teachings
were
and
devonham
growing
more
and
more
uneasy
as
he
noted
the
signs
of
increasing
intensity
and
disturbance
in
his
pupil
recited
if
somewhat
imperfectly
the
main
points
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
as
he
did
so
began
to
murmur
quietly
to
himself
his
eyes
grew
large
and
bright
his
face
lit
up
his
whole
body
trembled
he
began
that
deep
rhythmical
breathing
which
seemed
to
affect
the
atmosphere
about
him
so
that
his
physical
appearance
increased
and
spread
the
skin
took
on
something
of
radiance
as
though
an
intense
inner
happiness
shone
through
it
then
suddenly
to
devonham
horror
he
began
to
hum
though
a
normal
ordinary
sound
enough
it
reminded
him
of
that
other
sound
he
had
once
shared
with
fillery
when
he
sat
on
the
stairs
staring
at
a
china
bowl
filled
with
visiting
cards
while
the
dawn
broke
after
a
night
of
exhaustion
and
bewilderment
that
sound
of
course
he
had
long
since
explained
and
argued
away
it
was
an
auditory
hallucination
conveyed
to
his
mind
by
levallon
who
originated
it
interesting
and
curious
it
was
far
from
inexplicable
it
was
disquieting
however
for
it
touched
in
him
a
vague
sense
of
alarm
as
though
it
paved
the
way
for
that
odd
panic
terror
he
had
been
amazed
to
discover
hidden
away
deeply
in
some
unrealized
corner
of
his
being
this
humming
he
now
listened
to
though
normal
and
ordinary
enough
there
were
no
big
vibrations
with
it
for
one
thing
was
too
suggestive
of
that
other
sound
for
him
to
approve
of
it
his
mind
rapidly
sought
some
way
of
stopping
it
a
command
above
all
an
impatient
harsh
command
was
out
of
the
question
yet
a
request
seemed
equally
not
the
right
way
he
fumbled
in
his
mind
to
find
the
wise
proper
words
he
stretched
his
hand
out
as
though
to
lay
it
quietly
upon
his
companion
shoulder
but
realized
suddenly
he
could
not
almost
he
dared
not
touch
him
the
same
instant
rose
he
pushed
his
chair
back
and
stood
up
devonham
justly
proud
of
his
equable
temperament
and
steady
nerves
admits
that
only
a
great
effort
of
enabled
him
to
sit
quietly
and
listen
he
listened
watched
and
made
mental
notes
to
the
best
of
his
ability
but
he
was
frightened
a
little
the
outburst
was
so
sudden
he
is
not
sure
that
his
report
of
what
he
heard
made
later
to
fillery
was
a
verbatim
accurate
one
justice
we
know
cried
in
his
voice
that
seemed
to
boom
with
resonance
but
this
this
mercy
gentle
kindness
beauty
this
unknown
loveliness
we
did
not
know
it
he
went
to
the
open
window
and
threw
his
arms
wide
as
though
he
invoked
the
sun
dimly
we
heard
of
it
we
strive
we
strive
we
weave
and
build
and
fashion
while
the
whirl
of
centuries
flies
on
this
lesser
god
he
came
among
us
too
making
our
service
sweeter
though
we
did
not
understand
our
work
grew
wiser
and
more
careful
we
built
lovelier
forms
and
knew
not
why
we
did
so
his
mighty
rhythms
touched
us
with
their
power
and
happy
light
oh
my
great
messengers
of
wind
and
fire
bring
me
the
memory
i
have
lost
oh
where
where
he
shook
himself
as
though
his
clothes
perhaps
his
body
even
irked
him
it
was
a
curious
coincidence
thought
devonham
as
he
watched
and
listened
too
surprised
and
puzzled
to
interfere
either
by
word
or
act
that
a
cloud
at
that
very
moment
passed
from
the
face
of
the
sun
and
a
gust
of
wind
shook
all
the
branches
of
the
lime
trees
in
the
garden
stood
drenched
in
the
white
clear
sunshine
his
flaming
hair
was
lifted
by
the
wind
behind
beyond
the
suns
he
dwells
and
burns
for
ever
oh
the
mercy
kindness
the
strange
beauty
of
this
personal
love
what
is
it
these
have
been
promised
to
too
he
broke
off
abruptly
bowed
his
great
head
and
shoulders
and
sank
upon
his
knees
in
an
attitude
of
worship
then
stretching
his
arms
out
to
the
sky
the
face
raised
into
the
flood
of
sunlight
while
his
voice
became
lower
softer
almost
hushed
he
spoke
again
our
faithful
service
while
the
circles
swallow
the
suns
shall
lift
us
too
you
who
sent
me
here
to
help
this
little
dying
race
oh
help
me
to
remember
his
passion
was
a
moving
sight
the
words
broken
through
with
fragments
of
his
chanting
singing
had
the
blood
of
some
infinite
intolerable
yearning
in
them
devonham
meanwhile
having
heard
outbursts
of
this
strange
kind
before
with
others
had
recovered
something
of
his
equanimity
he
felt
more
sure
of
himself
again
the
touch
of
fear
had
left
him
he
went
over
to
the
window
the
attack
as
he
deemed
it
was
passing
a
thick
cloud
hid
the
sun
again
there
there
he
said
soothingly
laying
both
hands
upon
the
other
shoulders
then
taking
the
arms
to
help
him
rise
i
told
you
his
teachings
were
very
beautiful
that
the
world
would
become
a
kind
of
heaven
if
people
lived
them
his
voice
seemed
not
his
own
beside
the
volume
and
music
of
the
other
it
had
a
thin
rasping
ugly
sound
was
on
his
feet
gazing
down
into
his
face
to
amazement
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
that
met
his
own
and
many
people
live
them
try
to
rather
he
added
gently
there
are
thousands
who
really
worship
this
lesser
god
you
ca
go
far
wrong
yourself
if
you
take
him
as
your
model
an
how
he
must
have
suffered
came
the
astonishing
interruption
the
voice
quiet
and
more
natural
again
there
was
no
way
of
telling
what
he
knew
he
had
no
words
of
course
you
are
all
so
difficult
so
caged
so
dead
devonham
smiled
he
used
parables
he
paused
a
moment
then
went
on
men
have
existed
on
the
planet
science
tells
us
for
at
least
years
whereas
came
here
only
years
ago
came
interrupted
the
pupil
as
though
the
earth
were
but
one
of
a
thousand
places
visited
a
hint
of
contempt
and
pity
somewhere
in
his
tone
and
gesture
we
made
his
way
ready
then
we
prepared
we
built
it
was
for
that
our
work
went
on
and
on
so
faithfully
he
broke
off
devonham
experienced
a
curious
sensation
as
he
heard
in
that
instant
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
conscious
of
the
movement
of
the
earth
through
space
he
was
aware
that
the
planet
on
which
he
stood
was
rushing
forward
at
eighteen
miles
a
second
through
the
sky
he
felt
himself
carried
forward
with
it
what
was
his
name
he
heard
asking
it
was
as
though
he
was
aware
of
the
enormous
interval
in
space
traversed
by
the
rolling
earth
between
the
first
and
last
words
of
the
sudden
question
it
trailed
through
an
immense
distance
towards
him
after
him
yet
at
the
same
time
ever
with
him
his
name
oh
jesus
christ
we
call
him
wondering
at
the
same
moment
why
he
used
the
pronoun
we
jesus
christ
repeated
the
name
with
such
intensity
and
power
that
the
sound
borne
by
deep
vibrations
seemed
to
surge
and
circle
forth
into
space
while
the
earth
rushed
irresistibly
onwards
a
faintly
imaginative
idea
occurred
to
devonham
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
was
as
though
the
earth
herself
had
opened
her
green
lips
and
uttered
the
great
name
with
this
came
also
the
amazing
and
disconcerting
conviction
that
nature
and
humans
were
expressions
of
one
and
the
same
big
simple
energy
and
that
while
their
forms
their
bodies
differed
the
life
manifesting
through
them
was
identical
though
its
degree
might
vary
for
an
instant
this
was
of
such
overpowering
conviction
as
to
be
merely
obvious
it
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
though
he
still
was
dimly
conscious
that
he
had
travelled
with
the
earth
through
another
huge
stretch
of
space
then
this
sense
of
movement
also
passed
he
looked
up
was
in
his
chair
again
at
the
table
reading
quietly
his
book
on
natural
history
but
in
his
eyes
the
moisture
of
tears
was
still
visible
devonham
adjusted
his
glasses
blew
his
nose
went
quickly
to
another
room
to
jot
down
his
notes
of
the
talk
the
reactions
the
general
description
and
in
doing
so
dismissed
from
his
mind
the
slight
uneasy
effects
of
what
had
been
a
curious
hallucination
caused
evidently
by
an
unexplained
stimulation
of
the
motor
centres
in
the
brain
chapter
xxv
the
full
account
of
with
all
he
said
and
did
his
effect
upon
others
his
general
activities
in
a
word
it
is
impossible
to
compress
intelligibly
into
the
compass
of
these
notes
a
complete
report
edward
fillery
indeed
accumulated
but
its
publication
he
realized
must
await
that
leisure
for
which
his
busy
life
provided
little
opportunity
his
eyes
mental
and
physical
were
never
off
his
patient
and
aware
of
it
leaped
out
to
meet
the
observant
sympathy
giving
all
he
could
concealing
nothing
yet
debarred
it
seemed
by
the
rigid
limitations
of
his
own
mental
and
physical
machinery
as
similarly
by
that
of
his
hearers
from
contributing
more
than
suggestive
and
tantalizing
hints
of
the
use
of
parable
he
obviously
had
no
knowledge
his
relations
with
others
perhaps
offered
the
most
significant
comments
on
his
personality
fillery
was
at
some
pains
to
collect
these
the
reactions
were
various
yet
one
and
all
showed
this
in
common
a
curious
verdict
but
unanimous
that
his
effect
namely
was
greatest
when
he
was
not
there
not
in
his
actual
presence
which
promised
rather
than
fulfilled
was
his
power
so
dominating
upon
mind
and
imagination
as
after
the
door
was
closed
and
he
was
gone
the
withdrawal
of
his
physical
self
its
absence
as
fillery
had
himself
experienced
one
night
on
hampstead
heath
as
well
as
on
other
occasions
brought
his
real
presence
closer
it
was
nayan
who
first
drew
attention
to
this
remarkable
characteristic
she
spoke
about
him
often
now
with
fillery
for
as
the
weeks
passed
and
she
realized
the
uselessness
the
impossibility
of
the
plan
she
had
proposed
to
herself
she
found
relief
in
talking
frankly
about
him
to
her
older
friend
always
always
after
i
leave
him
she
confessed
a
profound
and
searching
melancholy
gets
hold
of
me
poignant
as
death
yet
an
extraordinary
unrealized
beauty
behind
it
somewhere
it
steals
into
my
very
blood
and
bones
i
feel
an
intense
dissatisfaction
with
the
world
with
people
as
they
are
and
a
burning
scorn
for
all
that
is
small
unworthy
petty
mean
and
yet
a
hopelessness
of
ever
attaining
to
that
something
which
knows
and
lives
so
easily
she
sighed
gazing
into
his
eyes
a
moment
or
of
ever
making
others
see
it
she
added
and
that
he
asked
can
you
define
it
she
shook
her
head
it
in
me
within
reach
even
but
the
word
he
used
is
the
only
one
forgotten
perhaps
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
he
simply
can
not
describe
it
there
are
no
words
no
means
at
his
disposal
no
human
terms
perhaps
she
murmured
desirable
though
he
urged
her
gently
she
clasped
her
hands
smiling
heavenly
she
murmured
closing
her
eyes
a
moment
as
though
to
try
and
recall
it
yet
when
i
with
him
she
went
on
he
never
realizes
for
me
the
state
of
wonder
and
delight
his
presence
promises
his
personality
suggests
rather
than
fulfils
she
paused
a
wistful
pained
expression
in
her
dark
eyes
the
failure
she
added
quickly
lest
she
seem
to
belittle
him
of
whom
she
spoke
of
course
lies
in
myself
i
refuse
you
see
i
say
why
though
i
feel
it
wise
to
let
myself
be
dominated
by
that
strange
lost
part
of
me
he
stimulates
true
interposed
fillery
i
understand
yet
to
have
felt
this
even
is
a
sign
that
he
stirs
the
deepest
highest
in
me
this
hint
of
divine
beauty
in
the
unrealized
he
nodded
there
was
an
odd
touch
of
sadness
in
their
talk
watched
him
with
many
types
of
people
he
went
on
thoughtfully
almost
as
though
thinking
aloud
in
his
rapid
way
i
talked
with
him
on
many
subjects
the
meanness
jealousy
insignificance
of
the
race
shocks
and
amazes
him
he
can
not
understand
it
he
asked
me
once
is
no
one
noble
to
be
splendid
is
such
an
effort
with
them
splendour
of
conduct
he
noticed
is
a
calculated
rarely
a
spontaneous
splendour
the
general
resistance
to
new
ideas
also
puzzles
him
fear
a
rhythm
they
have
never
felt
before
as
he
put
it
adopt
a
new
rhythm
they
think
must
somehow
injure
them
that
the
race
respects
a
man
because
he
possesses
much
equally
bewilders
him
one
serves
willingly
or
naturally
he
observed
unless
someone
else
receives
money
for
drawing
attention
loudly
to
it
any
notion
of
reward
of
advertisement
in
its
widest
meaning
is
foreign
to
his
nature
he
broke
off
another
pause
fell
between
them
the
girl
the
first
to
break
it
he
suffers
she
said
in
a
low
voice
here
he
suffers
and
her
face
yearned
with
the
love
and
help
she
longed
to
pour
out
beyond
all
thought
of
self
or
compensation
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
pain
of
its
inevitable
frustration
and
watching
her
fillery
understood
that
this
very
yearning
was
another
proof
of
the
curious
impetus
the
intensification
of
being
that
caused
in
everyone
yet
he
winced
as
though
anticipating
the
question
she
at
once
then
put
to
him
you
are
afraid
for
him
edward
her
eyes
calmly
searchingly
on
his
his
future
troubles
you
he
turned
to
her
with
abrupt
intensity
if
iraida
could
not
enchain
him
he
broke
off
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
no
power
she
confessed
an
insatiable
longing
burns
like
a
fire
in
him
nothing
he
finds
here
on
earth
among
men
and
women
can
satisfy
it
a
faint
blush
stole
up
her
neck
and
touched
her
cheeks
he
is
different
have
no
power
to
keep
him
here
her
voice
sank
suddenly
to
a
whisper
as
though
a
breath
of
awe
passed
into
her
he
is
here
now
at
this
very
moment
i
believe
he
is
with
us
as
we
talk
together
i
feel
him
almost
a
visible
thrill
passed
through
her
and
close
so
very
close
to
fillery
made
no
sign
by
word
or
gesture
but
something
in
his
very
silence
gave
assent
and
not
alone
she
added
still
under
her
breath
it
seemed
she
looked
about
her
though
she
did
not
actually
move
or
turn
her
head
others
of
his
kind
edward
come
with
him
they
are
always
with
him
i
think
sometimes
her
whisper
was
fainter
still
you
feel
that
too
he
said
it
abruptly
his
voice
louder
and
almost
challenging
then
he
added
incongruously
as
though
saying
it
to
himself
this
time
that
what
i
mean
i
known
it
for
a
long
time
he
looked
at
the
girl
sharply
with
unconcealed
admiration
it
does
not
frighten
you
he
asked
and
in
reply
she
said
the
very
thing
he
felt
sure
she
would
say
hoping
for
it
even
while
he
shrank
escape
he
heard
in
a
low
clear
voice
half
a
question
half
an
exclamation
and
saw
the
blood
leave
her
face
the
instinctive
hush
that
rose
to
his
lips
he
did
not
utter
the
sense
of
loss
of
searching
pain
the
word
implied
he
did
not
show
instead
he
spoke
in
his
natural
everyday
tone
again
the
body
irks
him
of
course
and
he
may
try
to
rid
himself
of
it
its
limitations
to
him
are
a
prison
for
his
true
consciousness
he
finds
outside
it
the
explanation
he
added
to
himself
of
many
a
case
of
suicidal
mania
probably
i
often
wondered
he
took
her
hand
aware
by
the
pallor
of
her
face
what
her
feelings
were
death
you
see
nayan
has
no
meaning
for
him
as
it
has
for
us
who
think
consciousness
out
of
the
body
impossible
and
he
is
puzzled
by
our
dread
of
it
he
said
once
nothing
that
decays
we
may
be
stationary
or
advance
or
retreat
but
we
can
never
end
he
derives
oh
i
convinced
of
it
from
another
order
here
amongst
us
he
is
inarticulate
unable
to
express
himself
hopeless
helpless
in
prison
oh
if
only
he
loves
she
said
quickly
releasing
her
hand
i
suppose
he
realizes
the
eternal
part
of
you
and
identifies
himself
with
that
in
you
edward
lies
something
very
close
to
what
he
is
akin
he
needs
it
terribly
just
as
you
she
became
confused
love
as
we
understand
it
he
interrupted
his
voice
shaking
a
little
he
does
not
can
not
know
for
he
serves
another
law
another
order
of
being
that
how
i
feel
it
too
she
shivered
slightly
but
she
did
not
turn
away
and
her
eyes
kept
all
their
frankness
our
humanity
she
murmured
writes
upon
his
heart
in
ink
that
quickly
fades
and
leaves
no
trace
he
caught
her
up
hurriedly
his
one
idea
is
to
help
to
render
service
it
is
as
natural
to
him
as
for
water
to
run
down
hill
he
seeks
instinctively
to
become
one
with
the
person
he
seeks
to
aid
as
with
us
an
embrace
is
an
attempt
at
union
so
he
seeks
by
some
law
of
his
own
being
to
become
identified
with
those
whom
he
would
help
and
he
helps
by
intensifying
their
consciousness
somewhat
as
heat
and
air
increase
ordinary
physical
vitality
only
first
there
must
be
something
for
him
to
work
on
energy
even
bad
vicious
wrongly
used
he
can
work
on
mere
emptiness
prevents
him
you
remember
lady
gleeson
we
most
of
us
are
too
empty
she
put
in
with
quiet
resignation
our
sense
of
that
divine
beauty
is
too
faint
rather
came
the
quick
correction
he
stands
too
close
to
us
his
effect
is
too
concentrated
the
power
at
such
close
quarters
disturbs
and
overbalances
that
why
then
i
always
feel
it
strongest
when
he
left
he
glanced
at
her
keenly
in
his
presence
she
explained
it
always
as
though
i
saw
only
a
part
of
him
even
of
his
physical
appearance
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
as
it
were
and
sometimes
she
hesitated
he
did
not
help
her
this
time
as
if
those
others
many
others
similar
to
himself
but
invisible
crowding
space
about
us
were
intensely
active
her
voice
hushed
again
he
brings
them
with
him
as
now
i
feel
it
edward
now
i
feel
them
close
she
looked
round
the
empty
room
peering
through
the
window
into
the
quiet
evening
sky
fillery
also
turned
away
he
sighed
again
have
you
noticed
too
he
went
on
presently
yet
half
as
if
following
his
own
thoughts
and
a
trifle
incongruously
the
speed
and
lightness
his
very
movements
convey
and
how
he
goes
down
the
street
with
that
curious
air
of
drawing
things
after
him
along
with
him
as
trains
and
motors
draw
the
loose
leaves
and
dust
whirling
her
quick
whisper
startled
him
a
little
as
she
turned
abruptly
from
the
window
and
gazed
straight
at
him
he
smiled
instantly
recovering
himself
a
good
word
yes
whirling
but
in
the
plural
as
though
there
were
vortices
about
him
it
was
her
turn
to
smile
that
might
one
day
carry
him
away
she
exclaimed
they
smiled
together
then
they
even
laughed
but
somewhere
in
their
laughter
like
the
lengthening
shadows
of
the
spring
day
outside
lay
an
incommunicable
sadness
neither
of
them
could
wholly
understand
yet
the
craving
for
beauty
she
said
suddenly
that
he
leaves
behind
in
me
her
voice
wavered
an
intolerable
yearning
that
nothing
can
satisfy
nothing
here
an
infinite
desire
it
seems
for
for
fillery
took
her
hand
again
gently
looking
down
steadily
into
the
clear
eyes
that
sought
his
own
and
the
light
glistening
in
their
moisture
was
similar
he
fancied
for
a
moment
to
the
fire
in
another
pair
of
shining
eyes
that
never
failed
to
stir
the
unearthly
dreams
in
him
it
lies
beyond
any
words
of
ours
he
said
softly
do
struggle
to
express
it
iraida
to
the
flower
the
star
we
are
wise
to
leave
their
own
expression
in
their
own
particular
field
for
we
can
not
better
it
a
sound
of
rising
wind
distant
yet
ominous
went
past
the
window
as
for
a
moment
then
the
girl
came
closer
till
she
was
almost
in
his
arms
and
though
he
did
not
accept
her
equally
he
did
not
shrink
from
the
idea
of
acceptance
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
known
one
another
there
was
a
smell
of
flowers
almost
in
that
wailing
wind
he
was
aware
of
music
together
he
heard
her
whisper
while
a
faint
shiver
was
it
of
joy
or
terror
ran
through
her
nerves
all
of
us
when
the
time
comes
together
she
made
an
abrupt
movement
just
as
we
are
together
now
listen
she
exclaimed
we
call
it
wind
she
whispered
but
of
course
really
behind
beyond
inside
is
it
fillery
holding
her
closely
made
no
answer
then
he
laughed
let
go
her
hands
and
said
in
his
natural
tone
again
breaking
an
undesirable
spell
intentionally
though
with
a
strong
effort
we
are
in
space
and
time
remember
iraida
let
us
obey
them
happily
until
another
certain
and
practical
thing
is
shown
us
the
faint
sound
that
had
been
rising
about
them
in
the
air
died
down
again
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
then
drew
apart
though
with
a
movement
so
slight
it
was
scarcely
perceptible
it
was
nayan
and
fillery
once
more
but
not
before
the
former
had
apparently
picked
out
the
very
thought
that
had
lain
though
unexpressed
in
the
deepest
mind
its
sudden
rising
the
cause
of
his
deliberate
change
of
attitude
for
she
had
phrased
it
given
expression
to
it
though
from
an
angle
very
different
to
his
own
and
her
own
word
escape
used
earlier
in
the
conversation
had
deliberately
linked
on
with
it
as
of
intentional
purpose
he
must
go
back
the
time
is
coming
when
he
must
go
back
we
are
not
ready
for
him
here
not
yet
somewhat
in
this
fashion
though
without
any
actual
words
had
the
idea
appeared
in
letters
of
fire
that
leaped
and
flickered
through
a
mist
of
anguish
of
loss
of
loneliness
rising
out
of
the
depths
within
him
he
knew
whence
they
came
he
divined
their
origin
at
once
and
the
sound
though
faint
and
distant
at
first
confirmed
him
swiftly
behind
them
moreover
born
of
no
discoverable
antecedents
it
seemed
rose
simultaneously
the
phrase
that
father
collins
loved
a
being
in
his
own
place
is
the
ruler
of
his
fate
father
collins
for
all
his
faults
and
strangeness
was
a
personality
a
consciousness
that
might
prove
of
value
his
extraordinarily
swift
receptiveness
his
undoubted
telepathic
powers
his
fluid
sensitive
protean
comprehension
of
possibilities
outside
the
human
walls
above
the
earthly
ceiling
so
to
speak
value
suddenly
attached
itself
to
father
collins
as
though
the
name
had
been
dropped
purposely
into
his
mind
by
someone
he
was
surprised
to
find
this
thought
in
him
it
was
not
for
the
first
time
however
fillery
remembered
in
nayan
father
again
an
artist
though
not
a
particularly
subtle
one
perhaps
lay
a
deep
admiration
almost
a
love
he
could
not
explain
there
something
about
him
in
a
sense
immeasurable
something
not
only
untamed
but
untamable
he
phrased
it
his
gentleness
conceals
it
as
a
summer
day
conceals
a
thunderstorm
to
me
it
almost
like
an
incarnation
of
the
primal
forces
at
work
in
the
hearts
of
my
own
people
he
grew
sad
and
as
dangerous
probably
he
was
speaking
to
his
daughter
who
repeated
the
words
later
to
fillery
the
study
of
fire
in
the
elemental
group
had
failed
too
big
too
vast
too
formless
to
get
into
any
shape
or
outline
tools
can
manage
even
by
suggestion
he
dominates
the
others
earth
air
water
and
dwarfs
them
but
fire
ought
to
she
put
in
it
the
most
powerful
and
splendid
the
most
terrific
of
them
all
is
it
it
regenerates
it
purifies
i
love
fire
her
father
smiled
in
his
beard
noticing
the
softness
in
her
manner
rather
than
in
her
voice
the
awakening
in
her
he
had
long
since
understood
sympathetically
if
more
profoundly
than
she
knew
and
welcomed
he
wo
hurt
you
child
he
wo
harm
nayushka
any
more
than
a
summer
day
can
hurt
her
i
see
him
thus
sometimes
he
mumbled
on
half
to
himself
though
she
heard
and
stored
the
words
in
her
memory
as
an
entire
day
a
landscape
even
i
often
see
him
a
stretch
of
being
rather
than
a
point
a
rushing
stream
rather
than
a
single
isolated
wave
harnessed
and
confined
in
definite
form
as
understand
being
here
he
added
curiously
no
he
neither
harm
nor
help
you
he
went
on
nor
any
of
us
for
that
matter
a
dozen
nations
a
planet
a
star
he
might
help
or
harm
he
laughed
aloud
suddenly
in
a
startled
way
at
his
own
language
but
an
individual
never
and
he
abruptly
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
drying
her
tears
with
his
own
rough
handkerchief
not
even
a
he
added
with
gruff
tenderness
like
you
there
more
of
divinity
in
fire
than
in
any
other
earthly
thing
we
know
she
replied
as
he
held
her
for
it
takes
into
itself
the
sweetest
essence
of
all
it
touches
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
smile
that
why
you
ca
get
it
into
your
marble
perhaps
to
which
her
father
made
the
significant
rejoinder
and
because
none
of
us
has
the
least
conception
what
and
really
mean
though
always
using
the
words
it
odd
anyhow
he
finished
reflectively
that
i
can
model
the
fellow
better
from
memory
than
when
he
standing
there
before
my
eyes
at
close
quarters
he
confuses
me
with
too
many
terrific
unanswerable
questions
to
multiply
the
verdicts
and
impressions
fillery
jotted
down
is
unnecessary
in
his
own
way
he
collected
in
his
own
way
he
wrote
them
down
about
all
agreed
in
their
various
ways
of
expressing
it
was
that
vital
suggestion
of
agelessness
of
deathlessness
of
what
men
call
eternal
youth
the
vigorous
grace
of
limbs
and
movements
the
deep
simple
joy
of
confidence
and
power
none
could
picture
him
tired
or
even
wearing
out
yet
ever
with
a
faint
hint
of
painful
conflict
due
to
immense
potentialities
a
day
compressed
into
a
single
minute
as
khilkoff
phrased
it
straining
but
vainly
to
express
themselves
through
a
limited
form
that
was
inadequate
to
their
use
a
storm
of
passionate
hope
and
wonder
seemed
ever
ready
to
tear
forth
from
behind
the
calm
of
the
great
quiet
eyes
those
changing
eyes
which
none
could
imagine
lightless
or
unlamping
and
about
his
whole
presentment
a
surplus
of
easy
overflowing
energy
from
an
inexhaustible
source
pressing
its
gifts
down
into
him
spontaneously
fire
and
wind
its
messengers
yet
that
the
human
machinery
using
these
mind
body
nerves
was
ill
adapted
to
their
full
expression
to
every
individual
having
to
do
with
him
was
given
a
push
a
drive
an
impetus
that
stimulated
that
individual
chief
characteristic
intensifying
it
this
to
imaginative
and
discerning
sight
but
even
upon
ordinary
folk
aware
only
of
the
surface
things
that
deliberately
hit
them
was
left
a
startling
impression
as
of
someone
waving
a
strange
unaccustomed
banner
that
made
them
halt
and
stare
before
passing
on
uncomfortably
he
had
that
nameless
quality
apart
from
looks
or
voice
or
manner
which
arrested
attention
and
drew
the
eyes
of
the
soul
wonderingly
perhaps
uneasily
upon
itself
he
left
a
mark
something
defined
him
from
all
others
leaving
him
silhouetted
in
the
mind
and
those
who
had
looked
into
his
eyes
could
not
forget
that
they
had
done
so
up
rose
at
once
the
great
unanswerable
questions
that
lying
ever
at
the
back
of
daily
life
the
majority
find
it
most
comfortable
to
leave
undisturbed
but
rose
in
red
ink
or
italics
he
started
into
an
awareness
of
greater
life
and
the
effect
remained
was
greatest
even
after
he
had
passed
on
it
was
of
course
father
collins
a
frequent
caller
now
at
the
home
betraying
his
vehement
interest
in
long
talks
with
fillery
and
in
what
interviews
with
the
latter
permitted
him
it
was
this
protean
being
whose
mind
amid
wildest
speculations
formed
the
most
positive
conclusions
the
prometheans
he
believed
were
not
far
wrong
in
their
instinctive
collective
judgment
was
not
a
human
being
the
occupant
of
that
magnificent
body
was
not
a
human
spirit
like
the
rest
of
us
nor
is
he
the
only
one
walking
the
streets
he
affirmed
mysteriously
in
shops
and
theatres
trains
and
buses
tucked
in
among
the
best
families
he
laughed
although
in
earnest
and
even
in
suburbia
i
have
come
across
other
human
bodies
similarly
inhabited
what
they
are
and
where
they
come
from
exactly
we
can
not
know
but
their
presence
among
us
is
indubitable
you
mean
you
recognize
them
inquired
fillery
calmly
one
unmistakable
sign
they
possess
in
common
they
are
invariably
inarticulate
helpless
lost
the
brain
the
five
senses
the
human
organs
all
they
have
to
work
through
are
useless
to
express
the
knowledge
and
powers
natural
to
them
electricity
might
as
well
try
to
manifest
itself
through
a
or
music
through
a
stone
one
and
all
too
possess
strange
glimmerings
of
another
state
where
they
are
happy
and
at
home
something
of
the
glory
à
la
wordsworth
a
golden
age
idea
almost
a
state
compared
to
which
humanity
seems
a
business
yet
a
state
of
which
no
single
descriptive
terms
occur
to
them
of
which
however
they
can
tell
us
nothing
memory
of
course
is
lost
their
present
brain
can
have
no
records
can
it
only
those
of
us
who
have
perhaps
at
some
time
in
some
earlier
existence
possibly
shared
such
a
state
can
have
any
idea
of
what
they
driving
at
he
glanced
at
fillery
with
a
significant
raising
of
his
bushy
eyebrows
there
have
been
no
phenomena
i
glad
to
say
put
in
the
doctor
aware
some
comment
was
due
from
him
no
physical
phenomena
i
mean
nor
could
there
be
pursued
the
other
delighted
he
has
not
got
the
apparatus
with
all
such
beings
their
power
rather
than
perceived
is
sex
as
with
us
they
also
can
not
know
for
they
are
neither
male
nor
female
he
paused
as
the
other
did
not
help
him
enigmas
they
must
always
be
to
us
we
may
borrow
from
the
east
and
call
them
or
class
them
among
nature
spirits
of
legend
and
the
rest
but
we
can
at
any
rate
welcome
them
and
perhaps
even
learn
from
them
learn
from
them
echoed
fillery
sharply
they
are
essentially
you
see
whereas
we
are
artificial
and
becoming
more
so
with
every
century
though
we
call
it
civilization
if
we
lived
closer
to
nature
we
might
get
better
results
i
mean
primitive
man
i
convinced
did
get
certain
results
but
he
was
a
poor
instrument
modern
man
in
some
ways
is
a
better
finer
instrument
to
work
through
only
he
is
blind
to
the
existence
of
any
beings
but
himself
a
bridge
however
might
be
built
i
feel
seems
to
me
in
close
touch
with
these
curious
beings
if
he
lowered
his
voice
he
is
not
actually
one
of
them
the
wind
and
fire
he
talks
about
are
of
course
not
what
mean
it
is
heat
and
rhythm
in
some
more
essential
form
he
refers
to
if
is
some
sort
of
nature
spirit
or
he
is
of
a
humble
type
concerned
with
humble
duties
in
the
universe
there
are
you
think
then
higher
bigger
kinds
inquired
the
listener
his
face
and
manner
showing
neither
approval
nor
disapproval
father
collins
raised
his
hands
and
face
and
shoulders
even
his
eyebrows
his
spirits
rose
as
well
if
they
exist
at
all
and
the
assumption
explains
plausibly
the
amazing
intelligence
behind
all
natural
phenomena
they
include
every
grade
of
course
from
the
insignificant
fairies
so
called
builders
of
simple
forms
to
the
immense
planetary
spirits
and
vast
intelligences
who
guide
and
guard
the
welfare
of
the
greater
happenings
his
eyes
shone
his
tone
matched
in
enthusiasm
his
gestures
a
stupendous
and
magnificent
hierarchy
he
cried
but
all
all
under
god
of
course
who
maketh
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
ah
think
of
it
he
went
on
becoming
lyrical
almost
as
wonder
fired
him
think
of
it
now
especially
in
the
spring
the
vast
abundance
and
insurgence
of
life
pouring
up
on
all
sides
into
forms
and
bodies
and
all
led
directed
fashioned
by
this
host
of
invisible
yet
not
unknowable
intelligences
think
of
the
prolific
architecture
the
delicacy
the
grandeur
the
inspiring
beauty
that
are
involved
you
said
just
now
a
bridge
might
be
built
fillery
interrupted
while
the
other
paused
a
second
for
breath
father
collins
nailed
down
to
a
positive
statement
hesitated
and
looked
about
him
but
the
hesitation
passed
at
once
it
is
the
question
merely
he
went
on
more
composedly
of
providing
the
apparatus
the
means
of
manifestation
the
instrument
the
body
is
it
our
evolution
and
theirs
are
two
separate
different
things
i
suppose
so
no
force
can
express
itself
without
a
proper
apparatus
certain
of
these
intelligences
are
so
immense
that
only
a
series
of
events
long
centuries
a
period
of
history
as
we
call
it
can
provide
the
means
the
body
indeed
through
which
they
can
express
themselves
an
entire
civilization
may
be
the
used
by
an
archetypal
power
others
again
like
probably
since
i
notice
that
it
is
usually
the
artist
the
artistic
temperament
affects
most
require
beauty
for
their
expression
beauty
of
form
and
outline
of
sound
of
colour
he
paused
for
effect
but
no
comment
came
our
response
to
beauty
our
thrill
our
lift
of
delight
and
wonder
before
any
manifestation
of
beauty
these
are
due
only
to
our
perception
though
usually
unrecognized
except
by
artists
of
the
particular
intelligence
thus
trying
to
express
itself
fillery
suddenly
leaned
forward
listening
with
a
new
expression
on
his
face
he
betrayed
however
no
sign
of
what
he
thought
of
his
voluble
visitor
an
idea
none
the
less
had
struck
him
like
a
flash
between
the
eyes
of
the
mind
you
mean
he
interposed
patiently
that
just
as
your
fairies
use
form
and
colour
to
express
themselves
in
nature
we
might
use
beauty
of
a
mental
order
to
to
to
build
a
body
of
expression
yes
an
instrument
in
a
collective
sense
through
which
might
express
whatever
of
knowledge
wisdom
and
power
he
has
will
you
explain
yourself
a
little
more
definitely
father
collins
beamed
he
continued
with
an
air
of
intense
conviction
the
artist
is
ever
an
instrument
merely
and
for
the
most
part
an
unconscious
one
only
the
greatest
artist
is
a
conscious
instrument
no
man
is
an
artist
at
all
until
he
transcends
both
nature
and
himself
that
is
until
he
interprets
both
nature
and
himself
in
the
unknown
terms
of
that
greater
power
whence
himself
and
nature
emanate
he
is
aware
of
the
majestic
source
aware
that
the
universe
in
bulk
and
in
detail
is
an
expression
of
it
itself
a
limited
instrument
but
aware
further
and
here
he
proves
himself
great
artist
of
the
stupendous
lovely
central
power
whose
message
stammers
broken
and
partial
through
the
inadequate
instruments
of
ephemeral
appearances
he
creates
using
beauty
in
form
sound
colour
a
better
and
more
perfect
instrument
provides
this
central
power
with
a
means
of
fuller
expression
the
message
no
longer
stammers
halts
suggests
it
flows
it
pours
it
sings
he
has
fashioned
a
vehicle
for
its
passage
his
art
has
created
a
body
it
can
use
he
has
transcended
both
nature
and
himself
the
picture
poem
harmony
that
has
become
the
body
for
this
revelation
is
alone
great
art
exactly
came
the
patient
comment
that
was
asked
for
one
thing
is
certain
only
human
knowledge
expressed
in
human
terms
can
come
through
a
human
brain
no
mind
no
intellect
can
convey
a
message
that
transcends
human
experience
and
reason
art
however
can
it
can
supply
the
vehicle
the
body
but
even
here
the
great
artist
can
not
communicate
the
secret
of
his
vision
he
can
not
talk
about
it
tell
it
to
others
he
can
only
the
result
results
interrupted
fillery
in
a
curious
tone
what
results
exactly
would
you
look
for
there
was
a
burning
in
his
eyes
his
skin
was
tingling
what
else
but
a
widening
deepening
heightening
of
our
present
consciousness
came
the
instant
reply
an
extension
of
faculty
of
course
making
entirely
new
knowledge
available
a
group
of
great
artists
each
contributing
his
special
vision
respectively
of
form
colour
words
proportion
could
together
create
a
to
express
a
power
transcending
the
accumulated
wisdom
of
the
world
the
race
could
be
uplifted
taught
redeemed
you
have
already
given
some
attention
to
this
strange
idea
suggested
his
listener
watching
closely
the
working
of
the
other
face
you
have
perhaps
even
experimented
a
ceremonial
of
some
sort
you
mean
a
performance
a
ritual
or
what
father
collins
lowered
his
voice

the

he
whispered
can
alone
provide
a
vehicle
for
the
expression
of
those
intelligences
which
are
the
cosmic
powers
a
performance
of
some
sort
possibly

there

between
us
between
our

art
is
only
great
when
it
provides
a
true
form
for
the
expression
of
an
eternal
cosmic
power
by
combining
we
might
provide
a
means
for
their
manifestation
a
body
of
thought
as
it
were
through
which
our
might
become
articulate
is
that
your
idea
behind
the
question
lay
something
new
it
seemed
as
though
while
listening
to
the
exposition
of
an
odd
mystical
conception
his
mind
had
been
busy
with
a
preoccupation
privately
but
simultaneously
of
his
own
in
what
way
precisely
do
you
suggest
the
arts
might
combine
to
provide
this
he
asked
a
faint
tremor
noticeable
in
the
lowered
voice
that
replied
father
collins
promptly
never
at
a
loss
we
should
have
to
think
about
inspiration
will
come
to
us
probably
through
ceremonial
of
course
has
always
been
an
attempt
in
this
direction
only
it
has
left
the
world
so
long
that
people
no
longer
know
how
to
construct
a
real
one
the
ceremonials
of
are
ugly
vulgar
false
the
words
music
colour
gestures
everything
must
combine
in
perfect
harmony
and
proportion
to
be

it
is
a
forgotten
method
and
results
how
would
they
come
the
new
wisdom
and
knowledge
that
result
are
suddenly
there
the
members
of
the
group
the
power
has
expressed
itself
not
through
the
brain
of
course
but
rather
that
the
new
ideas
having
been
out
are
suddenly
there
there
has
been
an
extension
of
consciousness
a
group
consciousness
has
been
formed

there

fillery
moving
his
foot
unperceived
had
touched
a
bell
beneath
the
table
the
foot
however
groped
and
fumbled
as
though
unsure
of
itself
you
learn
to
swim
by
swimming
not
by
talking
about
it
father
collins
was
prepared
to
talk
on
for
another
hour
if
we
can
devise
the
means
and
i
feel
sure
we
can
we
shall
have
formed
a
bridge
between
the
two
evolutions
nurse
robbins
entered
with
apologies
a
case
upstairs
demanded
the
doctor
instant
attendance
devonham
was
engaged
one
thing
insisted
father
collins
as
they
shook
hands
and
he
got
up
to
go
one
thing
only
you
would
have
to
fear
he
was
very
earnest
evidently
the
signs
of
struggle
of
fierce
conflict
in
the
face
he
did
not
notice
and
that
is
a
hand
was
on
the
door
if
successful
if
we
provide
this
means
of
expression
for
him
we
provide
also
the
means
of
losing
him
death
he
opened
the
door
with
rough
unnecessary
violence
escape
he
would
no
longer
need
the
body
he
now
uses
he
would
and
be
gone
in
his
place
you
would
have
levallon
again
only
i
afraid
he
added
that
he
already
remembering
his
final
words
as
nurse
robbins
deftly
hastened
his
departure
in
the
hall
were
a
promise
to
communicate
the
results
of
his
further
reflections
and
a
suggestion
that
his
cottage
by
the
river
would
be
a
quiet
spot
in
which
to
talk
the
matter
over
again
but
fillery
having
thanked
nurse
robbins
for
her
prompt
attendance
to
his
bell
returned
to
the
room
and
sat
for
some
time
in
a
strange
confusion
of
anxious
thoughts
a
singular
idea
took
shape
in
him
that
father
collins
had
again
robbed
his
mind
of
its
unspoken
content
that
sensitive
receptive
nature
had
first
perceived
then
given
form
to
the
vague
incoherent
dreams
that
lurked
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
his
hidden
self
yet
if
that
were
so
and
if
already
was
remembering
a
wave
of
shadow
crept
upon
him
darkening
his
hope
his
enthusiasm
his
very
life
for
another
part
of
him
knew
quite
well
the
value
to
be
attributed
to
what
father
collins
had
said
instinctively
his
mind
sought
for
devonham
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
at
the
moment
to
wonder
why
this
was
so
chapter
xxvi
spring
had
come
with
her
sweet
torment
of
delight
her
promises
her
passion
and
london
lay
washed
and
perfumed
beneath
april
eager
sun
an
immense
persuasive
glamour
was
in
the
sky
the
whole
earth
caught
up
a
swifter
gear
as
the
magic
of
rich
creative
life
poured
out
of
dead
soil
into
flower
insect
bird
and
animal
the
prodigious
stream
omitted
no
single
form
every
body
pulsed
and
blossomed
at
full
strength
the
hidden
powers
in
each
seed
emerged
and
it
was
from
the
inanimate
body
of
the
earth
this
flood
of
increased
vitality
rose
into
edward
fillery
strolling
before
breakfast
over
the
wet
lawn
of
the
enclosed
garden
the
tide
of
new
life
rose
likewise
it
was
very
early
the
flush
of
dawn
still
near
enough
for
the
freshness
of
the
new
day
to
be
everywhere
the
greater
part
of
the
huge
city
was
asleep
he
was
alone
with
the
first
birds
the
dew
the
pearl
and
gold
of
the
sun
slanting
rays
he
saw
the
slates
and
chimneys
glisten
spring
like
a
visible
presence
was
passing
across
the
town
bringing
the
amazing
message
that
all
obey
yet
no
man
understands
this
is
its
touch
upon
the
blossomed
rose
the
fashion
of
its
hand
shaped
in
dark
soil
and
the
silence
of
the
seeds
the
robe
of
spring
it
weaves
it
maketh
and
unmaketh
mending
all
what
it
hath
wrought
is
better
than
had
been
slow
grows
the
splendid
pattern
that
it
plans
its
wistful
hands
between
the
lines
came
to
his
memory
while
upon
his
mind
fell
lovely
and
wonderful
impressions
it
was
as
though
the
subconsciousness
of
the
earth
herself
emerged
with
the
spring
producing
new
life
new
splendour
everywhere
out
of
a
single
patch
of
soil
the
various
roots
drew
material
they
then
fashioned
into
such
different
and
complicated
outlines
as
daisy
lily
rose
and
a
hundred
types
of
tree
from
the
same
bit
of
soil
emerged
these
intricate
patterns
and
designs
these
different
forms
at
this
very
moment
while
his
feet
left
dark
tracks
across
the
silvery
lawn
the
process
was
going
steadily
forward
all
over
england
beneath
those
very
feet
up
rushed
the
power
into
all
conceivable
bodies
colour
music
form
marvellously
organized
making
no
mistakes
were
turning
the
world
into
a
vast
delicious
garden
form
colour
sound
from
his
own
hidden
region
rose
again
the
flaming
hope
and
prophecy
he
stooped
and
picked
a
daisy
examining
with
rapt
attention
its
perfect
little
body
who
what
made
this
astonishing
thing
that
was
yet
among
the
humbler
forms
what
intelligence
devised
its
elaborate
outline
guarded
cared
for
tended
it
ensured
its
growth
and
welfare
he
gazed
at
its
white
rays
tipped
with
crimson
its
several
hundred
florets
its
composite
design
the
spring
life
had
been
pouring
through
it
until
he
picked
it
through
the
huge
mass
of
earth
body
its
tiny
roots
had
drawn
the
life
it
needed
this
power
was
now
cut
off
it
would
die
the
process
as
with
everything
else
was
automatic
and
unintelligent
it
seemed
an
incredible
explanation
the
old
familiar
question
troubled
him
but
he
saw
it
abruptly
now
from
a
new
angle
we
built
it
came
a
voice
so
close
that
it
seemed
behind
him
for
when
at
first
he
turned
startled
and
yet
not
startled
he
saw
no
figure
standing
we
who
work
in
darkness
yet
who
never
die
the
hidden
ones
who
build
and
weave
inside
and
out
of
sight
you
have
destroyed
our
work
of
ages
a
pang
of
sudden
regret
and
anguish
seized
him
he
stood
still
and
stared
in
the
direction
whence
he
thought
the
voice
had
come
but
no
form
no
outline
no
body
that
could
have
produced
a
sound
a
voice
was
visible
a
blackbird
flew
with
its
shrill
whistle
over
the
enclosing
wall
and
the
gardener
up
unusually
early
was
now
moving
slowly
past
the
elms
at
the
far
end
some
two
hundred
yards
away
the
old
man
he
remembered
had
been
telling
him
only
the
day
before
that
the
life
in
his
plants
this
year
had
been
prodigious
and
successful
beyond
his
whole
experience
it
puzzled
him
something
of
reverence
of
superstition
almost
had
lain
in
the
man
voice
and
eyes
who
are
you
whispered
fillery
still
holding
the
dead
broken
flower
in
his
hand
and
staring
about
him
he
was
aware
that
the
sound
from
which
the
voice
had
come
detaching
itself
as
it
were
into
articulate
syllables
out
of
a
general
continuous
volume
had
not
ceased
it
was
all
about
him
softly
murmuring
was
it
in
himself
perhaps
an
intense
inner
activity
like
the
pressure
of
an
enveloping
tide
that
was
also
in
space
in
the
soil
the
body
of
the
planet
rose
in
him
too
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
mind
was
suddenly
in
process
of
being
shaped
and
fashioned
into
a
new
body
of
understanding
a
new
instrument
of
understanding
this
is
its
work
upon
the
things
ye
see
the
unseen
things
are
more
men
hearts
and
minds
the
thoughts
of
peoples
and
their
ways
and
wills
these
too
the
great
law
binds
i
know
he
exclaimed
this
time
with
acceptance
that
omitted
the
doubt
he
had
first
felt
i
know
who
you
are
and
even
as
he
said
the
words
there
dropped
into
him
it
seemed
some
knowledge
some
hint
some
wonder
that
lay
he
well
knew
outside
all
human
experience
it
was
as
though
some
cosmic
power
brushed
gently
against
and
through
his
being
but
a
power
so
alien
to
known
human
categories
that
to
attempt
its
expression
in
human
terms
language
reason
imagination
even
were
to
mutilate
it
yet
even
for
its
partial
broken
manifestation
human
terms
were
alone
available
since
without
these
it
must
remain
unperceived
he
himself
unaware
of
its
existence
he
however
aware
of
its
presence
its
existence
all
that
was
left
to
him
therefore
was
his
own
personal
interpretation
herein
evidently
lay
the
truth
for
him
this
was
the
meaning
of
his
acceptance
it
was
in
some
way
a
renewal
of
that
other
vision
he
called
the
flower
hill
and
flower
music
experience
i
know
you
he
repeated
his
voice
merging
curiously
in
the
general
underlying
murmur
of
the
morning
you
belong
to
the
bodiless
the
deathless
ones
who
work
and
build
and
weave
eternally
form
sound
colour
are
your
instruments
the
elements
your
tools
you
wove
this
flower
he
fingered
the
dying
daisy
as
you
also
shaped
this
body
he
tapped
his
breast
and
you
built
as
well
this
mind
he
stopped
dead
two
things
arrested
him
the
feeling
that
the
ideas
were
not
primarily
his
own
but
derived
from
a
source
outside
himself
and
a
sudden
intensification
of
the
flaming
hope
and
prophecy
that
burst
up
as
with
new
meaning
into
the
words
mind
and
body
the
broken
body
of
the
flower
slipped
from
his
fingers
and
fell
upon
the
body
of
the
earth
he
looked
down
at
its
now
empty
form
through
which
no
life
flowed
and
his
eye
passed
then
to
his
own
body
beating
with
intense
activity
and
thence
to
the
bodies
of
the
trees
the
darting
birds
the
gigantic
sun
now
peering
magnificently
along
the
heavens
body
a
body
was
a
form
through
which
life
expressed
itself
a
vehicle
of
expression
by
means
of
which
life
manifested
an
instrument
it
used
but
a
body
of
thought
was
a
true
phrase
too
and
with
the
words
shaped
automatically
in
his
brain
a
new
light
flashed
and
flooded
him
with
its
waves
a
body
of
thought
a
mental
body
the
phrase
went
humming
and
flowing
strangely
through
him
a
body
of
thought
father
collins
he
remembered
had
used
some
such
wild
language
only
it
had
seemed
empty
words
without
intelligible
meaning
whence
came
the
intense
new
meaning
that
so
suddenly
attached
itself
to
the
familiar
phrase
whence
came
the
thrilling
deep
conviction
that
new
greater
knowledge
was
hovering
near
and
that
for
its
expression
a
new
body
must
be
devised
and
what
was
this
new
knowledge
this
new
power
whence
came
the
amazing
certainty
in
him
that
a
new
way
was
being
shown
to
him
a
means
of
progress
for
humanity
that
must
otherwise
flounder
always
to
its
average
level
of
growth
development
then
invariably
collapse
again
built
it
ran
past
him
through
the
air
again
or
rose
perhaps
from
the
stirred
depths
of
his
own
subconscious
being
or
again
dropped
from
a
hidden
rushing
star
the
more
perfect
and
adequate
the
form
the
greater
the
flow
of
life
of
knowledge
of
power
it
can
express
no
mind
no
intellect
can
convey
a
message
that
transcends
human
experience
yet
there
is
a
way
the
new
knowledge
was
there
if
only
the
new
vehicle
suited
to
its
expression
could
be
devised
the
stream
of
life
pouring
through
him
became
more
and
more
intense
some
power
of
perception
seemed
growing
into
white
heat
within
him
transcending
the
limited
senses
becoming
incandescent
this
tide
of
sound
inaudible
to
ordinary
ears
was
the
music
which
is
inseparable
from
the
rhythm
that
underlies
all
forms
the
music
of
the
manifold
activities
now
pouring
in
vibrations
huge
and
tiny
all
round
and
through
him
he
turned
instinctively
you
exclaimed
the
doctor
in
him
as
though
rebuke
reproval
stirred
you
here
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
figure
of
embodying
as
it
were
a
ray
of
sunlight
stood
beside
him
we
came
the
answer
with
a
smile
that
took
the
sparkling
sunlight
through
the
very
face
we
are
all
about
you
added
the
voice
with
a
rhythm
that
swamped
all
denial
all
objection
bringing
an
exultant
exhilaration
in
their
place
we
come
from
what
always
seems
to
you
a
valley
of
sun
and
flowers
where
we
work
and
play
behind
the
appearances
you
call
the
world
the
world
repeated
fillery
the
universe
as
well
the
voice
the
illusion
of
actual
words
both
died
away
merging
in
some
perplexing
fashion
into
another
appearance
perhaps
equally
an
illusion
so
far
as
the
senses
were
concerned
the
phenomenon
men
call
sight
instead
of
hearing
that
is
he
now
suddenly
saw
something
in
the
arrangement
of
light
caught
his
attention
holding
it
the
deep
central
self
in
him
that
which
interprets
and
the
reports
the
senses
bring
employed
another
mode
the
figure
of
still
was
definite
enough
in
form
indeed
yet
at
the
same
time
taking
the
rays
into
itself
as
though
it
were
a
body
of
light
there
was
no
transparency
of
course
nor
was
this
clear
radiance
seen
by
fillery
for
the
first
time
but
rather
that
his
natural
shining
was
caught
up
and
intensified
by
the
morning
sunshine
a
body
of
light
none
the
less
seemed
a
true
description
of
what
fillery
now
saw
this
sunshine
filled
the
air
the
space
all
round
him
the
entire
lawn
and
garden
shone
in
a
sparkling
flood
of
dancing
brilliance
it
blazed
the
figure
of
was
merely
a
portion
of
this
blazing
as
a
focus
but
one
of
many
he
now
thought
of
it
and
about
each
focus
was
the
toss
and
fling
of
lovely
spirals
across
the
main
stream
came
then
another
pulsing
movement
hardly
discernible
at
first
and
similar
to
an
that
moves
the
sea
against
the
wave
so
that
the
eye
perceives
it
only
when
not
looking
for
it
this
contrary
motion
it
soon
became
apparent
went
in
numerous
almost
countless
directions
so
that
within
and
below
its
complicated
he
was
aware
of
yet
other
motions
crossing
and
interlacing
at
various
speeds
until
the
space
about
him
seemed
to
whirl
with
myriad
rhythms
yet
without
the
least
confusion
these
rhythms
were
of
a
hundred
different
magnitudes
from
the
very
tiny
to
the
gigantic
and
while
the
smallest
were
of
a
radiant
brilliance
that
made
the
sunshine
pale
the
larger
ones
seemed
distant
their
light
of
an
intenser
quality
though
of
a
quality
he
had
never
seen
before
these
were
strangely
diffused
these
bigger
ones
distant
was
the
word
that
occurred
to
him
although
that
inner
brilliance
which
occurs
in
dreams
in
imaginative
moments
the
nameless
glow
that
colours
mental
vision
described
them
better
moreover
they
wore
colours
the
human
eye
had
never
seen
while
the
smallest
rhythms
were
lit
with
the
familiar
colours
of
the
prism
he
stood
absorbed
fascinated
drinking
in
the
amazing
spectacle
as
though
the
glowing
spirals
of
fire
communicated
to
his
inmost
being
a
heat
and
glory
of
creative
power
he
was
aware
of
the
creative
stream
of
spring
in
his
own
heart
pouring
from
the
body
of
the
earth
on
which
he
stood
drenching
mind
nerves
and
even
muscles
with
concentrated
life
his
subconscious
being
rose
and
stretched
its
wings
all
all
was
possible
a
sensation
of
divine
deathlessness
possessed
him
the
limitations
of
his
ordinary
human
faculties
and
powers
were
overborne
so
that
he
felt
he
could
never
again
face
the
mournful
prison
that
caged
him
in
the
meaning
of
escape
became
plain
to
him
he
saw
the
invisible
building
intelligences
at
work
he
was
aware
then
suddenly
of
purpose
of
intention
the
seeming
welter
of
the
waves
of
coloured
light
of
the
immense
and
tiny
rhythms
the
intricate
streams
of
vibrating
pulsing
throbbing
movements
were
he
now
perceived
marvellously
there
was
a
focus
a
vortex
towards
which
all
rushed
with
a
power
so
prodigious
that
a
sense
of
terror
touched
him
he
suddenly
became
conscious
of
a
pattern
forming
before
his
eyes
hanging
in
empty
space
shining
soft
with
light
and
beauty
it
became
he
saw
a
geometric
design
an
idea
of
crystals
a
spider
web
hung
with
glistening
dewdrops
shot
across
his
memory
the
spirals
whirled
and
sang
about
it
this
outline
he
next
perceived
was
the
focus
to
which
the
light
heat
colour
all
contributed
their
particular
touch
and
quality
it
glowed
now
in
the
centre
of
the
vortex
so
overwhelming
however
was
the
sense
of
the
stupendous
power
involved
that
as
he
phrased
it
afterwards
it
seemed
he
watched
the
formation
of
some
mighty
sun
it
was
the
whirling
of
those
sheets
of
incandescent
fires
that
attend
the
birth
of
a
nebula
he
watched
the
power
at
any
rate
was
gigantic
he
stood
trembling
before
a
revelation
that
left
him
lost
shelterless
bereft
of
any
help
that
his
little
self
might
summon
when
suddenly
with
an
emotion
of
strange
tenderness
he
saw
the
great
rhythms
become
completely
dominated
by
the
very
smallest
of
all
the
same
instant
the
pattern
grew
sharply
outlined
perfect
in
every
detail
as
though
the
focus
of
powerful
glasses
cleared
and
the
pattern
hung
a
moment
exquisitely
fashioned
in
space
beneath
his
eyes
before
it
sank
slowly
to
the
ground
it
remained
in
an
upright
position
on
the
grass
at
his
feet
a
daisy
growing
in
the
earth
alive
its
tiny
delicate
face
taking
the
sunlight
and
the
morning
wind
with
a
shock
he
then
realized
another
thing
it
was
the
very
daisy
he
had
broken
uprooted
killed
a
few
minutes
before
he
stooped
one
hand
outstretched
as
though
to
finger
its
wee
white
petals
but
found
instead
that
he
was
listening
listening
to
a
sweet
faint
music
that
rose
from
the
surface
of
the
lawn
from
grass
and
flowers
running
in
waves
and
circles
like
the
vibrations
of
gentle
wind
across
a
thousand
strings
it
was
similar
though
less
in
volume
to
the
sound
he
had
heard
in
the
presence
of
he
rose
slowly
to
an
upright
position
dazed
bewildered
yet
rapt
with
the
wonder
of
the
whole
experience
n
he
heard
his
voice
exclaim
its
sound
merging
in
the
growing
volume
of
music
all
about
him
n
he
cried
again
this
is
your
work
your
service
but
he
could
not
see
him
his
figure
was
no
longer
differentiated
from
the
sea
of
light
that
filled
space
wherever
he
looked
the
same
play
of
brilliance
shone
and
glistened
everywhere
whirling
ever
shifting
as
in
vortices
of
intricate
geometrical
designs
dancing
interpenetrating
and
with
a
magnificence
of
colour
that
caught
his
breath
away
there
were
remarkable
flashings
and
two
of
these
flashings
blazed
suddenly
together
forming
an
immense
physiognomy
an
expression
rather
as
of
a
mighty
face
the
same
instant
there
were
a
hundred
of
these
mighty
brilliant
visages
that
pierced
through
the
sea
of
whirling
colour
and
gazed
upon
him
close
terrific
with
a
power
and
beauty
that
left
thought
without
even
a
ghost
of
language
to
describe
them
their
glory
lay
beyond
all
earthly
terms
he
recognized
them
these
mighty
outlines
he
had
seen
before
his
mind
then
made
an
effort
he
tried
to
think
memory
and
reason
strove
with
emotion
and
sensation
the
forms
the
faces
the
powers
at
once
grew
fainter
they
faded
slowly
the
whirling
vortices
withdrew
in
some
extraordinary
way
the
colour
paled
the
sound
grew
thinner
ever
more
distant
the
great
weaving
designs
dissolved
the
lovely
spirals
all
were
gone
he
saw
the
garden
trees
again
the
flower
beds
space
emptied
showing
the
morning
sunshine
on
roofs
and
we
have
rebuilt
remade
it
he
heard
faintly
but
he
heard
also
the
roar
and
boom
of
the
gigantic
rhythms
as
they
withdrew
not
spatially
so
much
as
from
his
consciousness
that
was
now
contracting
once
more
till
only
the
fainter
sounds
of
the
smaller
singing
patterns
the
flower
music
as
he
had
come
to
call
it
reached
his
ears
words
and
music
like
voices
known
in
dreams
seemed
interwoven
he
remembered
the
huge
faces
with
their
bright
confidence
and
glory
rising
through
the
sunlight
peering
as
through
a
mirror
at
him
radiant
and
of
imperishable
beauty
the
words
perhaps
he
attached
himself
his
own
interpretations
of
their
ringing
motions
the
sounds
died
away
he
reeled
the
expansion
and
subsequent
contraction
of
consciousness
had
been
too
rapid
the
whole
experience
too
intense
he
swayed
unsure
of
his
own
identity
he
remembered
vaguely
that
tears
filled
his
eyes
and
rolled
down
his
cheeks
that
the
destruction
of
a
lovely
form
had
caused
him
a
peculiar
anguish
and
that
its
recreation
produced
an
intolerable
joy
bringing
tears
of
happiness
an
arm
caught
him
as
he
swayed
the
accents
of
a
voice
he
knew
were
audible
close
beside
him
but
at
first
he
did
not
understand
the
words
feeling
only
a
dull
pain
they
caused
their
imperishable
beauty
their
divine
loveliness
he
stammered
recognizing
the
face
and
voice
he
flung
his
arms
wide
gazing
into
the
now
empty
air
above
the
london
garden
the
great
service
they
eternally
fulfil
oh
that
we
all
might
he
made
a
gesture
towards
the
other
houses
with
their
sightless
shuttered
windows
i
know
i
know
came
in
the
familiar
tones
but
come
in
now
come
in
edward
with
me
i
beg
you
before
it
is
too
late
paul
voice
shook
so
that
it
was
hardly
recognizable
the
skin
of
his
face
was
white
he
wore
a
haggard
look
too
late
repeated
the
other
it
is
always
too
late
the
world
will
never
see
their
eyes
are
blinded
an
intolerable
emotion
swept
him
he
stared
suddenly
at
his
colleague
an
immense
surprise
in
him
but
you
paul
he
exclaimed
you
understand
even
you
devonham
led
him
slowly
into
the
house
there
was
protection
in
his
manner
in
voice
and
gesture
there
was
deep
affection
respect
as
well
but
behind
and
through
these
flickered
the
signs
of
another
unmistakable
emotion
that
fillery
at
first
could
hardly
credit
of
pity
was
it
of
something
at
any
rate
he
dared
not
contemplate
even
i
came
in
quick
low
tones
even
i
edward
understand
you
forget
i
was
once
alone
with
him
the
voice
sank
to
a
rapid
whisper
in
the
mountain
valley
devonham
expression
was
curious
he
raised
his
tone
again
but
not
now
not
now
i
beg
of
you
not
yet
at
any
rate
you
will
be
cast
out
judged
insane
your
work
destroyed
your
career
ruined
your
reputation
his
excitement
betrayed
itself
in
his
bright
eyes
and
unusual
gestures
he
was
shaken
to
the
core
fillery
turned
upon
him
they
were
in
the
corridor
now
he
flung
his
arm
free
of
the
restraining
hand
you
know
he
cried
yet
would
keep
silent
his
voice
choked
you
saw
what
i
saw
new
sources
open
the
offer
made
the
channels
accessible
at
our
very
door
yet
you
would
refuse
not
one
in
ten
million
came
the
hard
rejoinder
would
believe
the
voice
trembled
we
have
no
proof
their
laws
of
manifestation
are
unknown
to
us
and
such
glimpses
are
but
glimpses
useless
and
dangerous
he
whispered
suddenly
besides
what
are
they
what
after
all
are
we
dealing
with
we
can
experiment
interrupted
his
companion
quickly
how
of
what
possible
value
you
felt
what
i
felt
in
your
own
being
you
experienced
the
revelation
too
and
yet
you
use
such
words
new
forces
new
faculties
beings
from
another
order
of
incalculable
powers
to
ennoble
to
bless
to
inspire
the
creation
of
higher
forms
through
which
new
greater
life
and
knowledge
shall
manifest
he
could
hardly
find
the
words
he
sought
so
bright
was
the
hope
and
wonder
in
his
heart
still
think
at
a
time
like
this
what
humanity
might
gain
powers
paul
creative
acting
directly
on
the
subconscious
selves
of
everybody
intensifying
every
individual
whether
he
understands
and
believes
or
not
the
gods
paul
and
nothing
less
you
saw
the
daisy
devonham
seized
both
of
his
companion
hands
as
he
heard
the
torrent
of
wild
incoherent
words
you
have
the
entire
world
against
you
he
interrupted
why
seek
crucifixion
for
a
dream
then
as
his
hands
were
again
flung
off
he
turned
a
finger
suddenly
on
his
lips
hush
hush
edward
he
whispered
the
house
is
sleeping
still
you
wake
them
all
there
was
a
new
strange
authority
about
him
fillery
controlled
himself
they
went
upstairs
on
tiptoe
listen
murmured
devonham
as
they
reached
the
landing
that
what
woke
me
first
and
led
me
to
his
room
but
only
to
find
it
empty
he
was
already
gone
i
saw
him
join
you
on
the
lawn
i
watched
from
the
open
window
then
i
lost
him
listen
he
was
trembling
like
a
child
the
sound
still
echoed
faintly
distant
rising
and
falling
sweet
and
very
lovely
and
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
the
musical
hum
of
wind
that
sighs
and
whispers
across
the
strings
of
an
æolian
harp
to
one
man
came
incredible
sensations
as
they
paused
a
moment
dim
though
the
landing
was
there
still
seemed
a
tender
luminous
glow
pervading
it
they
everywhere
murmured
fillery
everywhere
and
always
about
us
though
in
different
space
through
and
behind
and
inside
everything
that
happens
helping
building
constructing
ceaselessly
oh
paul
how
can
you
doubt
and
question
value
behind
every
single
form
and
body
physical
or
mental
they
operate
divinely
mental
edward
for
god
sake
devonham
stepped
nearer
to
him
with
such
abruptness
that
his
companion
stopped
the
pallor
of
the
assistant
face
so
close
arrested
his
words
a
moment
they
held
their
breath
listening
together
side
by
side
the
sounds
grew
fainter
died
away
in
the
stillness
of
the
early
morning
then
ceased
altogether
it
was
not
the
first
time
they
had
listened
thus
to
the
strange
music
nor
was
it
the
first
time
that
fillery
entered
the
room
alone
as
once
before
his
colleague
remained
outside
watching
waiting
half
seduced
it
seemed
yet
vehemently
against
a
sympathetic
attitude
he
watched
his
chief
go
in
he
saw
the
expression
on
his
face
upon
his
own
behind
a
mild
expectancy
lay
a
look
of
pain
empty
he
heard
the
startled
exclamation
and
instantly
devonham
was
at
his
side
a
firm
hand
upon
his
arm
his
eyes
taking
in
an
unused
bed
a
window
opened
wide
a
glow
of
light
and
heat
the
early
sunshine
could
not
possibly
explain
the
perfume
as
of
flowers
in
the
air
he
noted
too
and
a
sense
of
lightness
freshness
sweetness
about
the
atmosphere
that
produced
happiness
exhilaration
the
room
throbbed
as
it
were
with
invisible
waves
of
some
communicable
power
even
he
could
not
deny
but
of
the
recent
occupant
there
was
no
sign
in
the
garden
still
i
lost
sight
of
him
somehow
i
told
you
fillery
crossed
quickly
to
the
window
his
colleague
with
him
looking
out
upon
a
lawn
and
paths
that
held
no
figure
anywhere
the
gardener
was
not
in
sight
only
the
birds
were
visible
among
the
daisies
the
quiet
sunlight
lay
as
usual
upon
leaves
and
flowers
waving
in
the
breeze
he
came
in
fillery
went
on
rapidly
under
his
breath
he
must
have
slipped
back
when
the
sound
of
steps
and
voices
behind
them
in
the
corridor
brought
both
men
round
with
a
quick
movement
as
nurse
robbins
her
arm
linked
in
that
of
stood
in
the
open
doorway
her
face
was
radiant
her
eyes
alight
her
breath
came
unevenly
and
one
might
have
thought
her
caught
midway
in
some
ecstatic
dance
that
still
left
its
joy
and
bliss
stamped
on
her
pretty
face
only
she
looked
more
than
pretty
there
was
beauty
a
fairy
loveliness
about
her
that
betrayed
an
intense
experience
of
some
inner
kind
at
the
sight
of
the
two
doctors
she
rapidly
composed
herself
leading
her
companion
quietly
into
the
room
he
was
upstairs
sir
she
said
respectfully
but
breathlessly
somewhat
and
addressing
herself
fillery
noticed
to
devonham
and
not
to
himself
he
was
going
from
room
to
room
talking
to
the
patients
er
singing
to
them
it
was
the
singing
woke
me
upstairs
exclaimed
devonham
he
has
been
up
there
she
broke
off
as
fillery
came
forward
and
took
by
the
hands
dismissing
her
with
a
gesture
she
was
quick
to
understand
devonham
went
with
her
hurriedly
intent
upon
a
personal
inspection
at
once
your
service
called
you
said
fillery
quietly
the
moment
they
were
alone
i
understand
through
the
contact
of
the
hands
waves
of
power
entered
him
it
seemed
about
the
face
was
light
as
though
fire
glowed
behind
the
very
skin
and
eyes
producing
the
effect
almost
of
a
halo
they
came
for
me
and
i
must
go
the
voice
was
deep
and
wonderful
with
prolonged
vibrations
i
have
found
my
own
i
must
return
where
my
service
needs
me
for
here
i
can
do
so
little
to
your
own
place
where
you
are
ruler
of
your
fate
the
other
said
slowly
here
you
here
came
the
quick
interruption
while
the
voice
lost
its
resonance
fading
as
it
were
in
sadness
here
i
die
even
the
radiance
of
his
face
although
he
smiled
dimmed
a
little
on
that
final
word
i
can
help
where
i
belong
not
here
the
light
returned
the
music
came
back
into
the
amazing
voice
the
daisy
whispered
fillery
joy
rising
in
him
strangely
nature
floated
through
the
air
like
music
is
my
place
with
human
beings
i
can
not
work
it
is
too
much
and
i
only
should
destroy
they
are
not
ready
yet
for
our
great
rhythms
injure
them
and
they
can
not
understand
trembling
with
emotions
he
could
neither
define
nor
control
fillery
led
him
to
the
window
even
in
this
little
of
a
london
house
he
murmured
among
so
to
speak
the
humble
buttercups
and
daisies
of
our
life
the
creative
intelligences
at
work
building
ever
building
the
best
forms
they
can
you
a
broken
daisy
his
voice
rose
as
the
great
shining
face
so
close
lit
with
its
flaming
smile
you
as
well
our
broken
minds
in
the
subconscious
hides
our
creative
power
that
you
stimulate
it
is
with
that
and
that
alone
you
work
it
hides
in
all
of
us
though
the
artist
alone
perceives
or
can
use
it
it
is
with
that
you
work
with
you
dear
fillery
i
can
work
for
you
help
me
to
remember
you
feel
the
big
rhythms
that
we
bring
fillery
started
peered
about
him
listened
hard
was
it
the
trees
shaking
in
the
morning
wind
that
rustled
was
it
a
voice
the
dancing
leaves
reflected
the
sunshine
from
a
thousand
facets
the
sound
accompanied
rather
than
interrupted
his
own
speech
he
turned
back
to
with
passionate
enthusiasm
using
beauty
the
artists
the
creative
powers
of
the
race
he
went
on
we
shall
create
together
a
new
body
a
new
vehicle
through
which
your
powers
can
express
themselves
the
intellect
can
not
serve
you
it
is
the
creative
imagination
of
those
who
know
beauty
that
you
seek
you
are
inarticulate
in
this
wretched
body
we
shall
make
a
new
one
they
have
come
for
me
and
i
must
go
we
will
work
together
oh
stay
stay
with
me
i
have
found
the
way
i
have
remembered
i
must
go
back
the
wind
died
down
the
leaves
stopped
rustling
the
sunshine
seemed
to
pale
as
though
a
cloud
passed
over
the
sky
the
words
he
had
heard
resolved
themselves
into
the
morning
sounds
the
singing
of
the
birds
had
they
been
words
at
all
bewilderment
like
a
pain
rushed
over
him
he
knew
himself
suddenly
imprisoned
caught
i
have
remembered
he
heard
in
quiet
tones
but
the
voice
dead
no
resonance
no
music
in
it
and
across
the
room
he
saw
suddenly
paul
devonham
just
inside
the
door
returned
from
his
inspection
beside
him
stood
levallon
an
extraordinary
reaction
instantly
took
place
in
him
a
lid
was
raised
a
shutter
lifted
a
wall
fell
flat
he
hardly
knew
how
to
describe
it
was
it
due
to
the
look
of
anxiety
of
tenderness
of
affectionate
of
protective
care
he
saw
plainly
upon
his
face
he
could
not
say
he
only
knew
for
certain
in
that
instant
that
paul
devonham
main
preoccupation
was
with
himself
that
the
latter
regarded
him
exactly
as
he
regarded
any
other
yes
that
was
the
only
word
any
other
patient
that
he
looked
after
him
tended
guarded
cared
for
him
and
that
this
watchful
experienced
observation
had
been
going
on
now
for
a
long
long
time
the
authority
in
his
manner
became
abruptly
clear
as
day
devonham
watched
over
him
also
he
watched
him
for
days
for
weeks
this
had
been
his
attitude
for
the
first
time
in
this
instant
as
he
saw
him
lead
away
levallon
into
his
own
room
and
close
the
door
fillery
now
perceived
this
he
experienced
a
violent
revulsion
of
mind
in
a
flash
a
hundred
details
of
the
recent
past
occurred
to
him
chief
among
them
the
fact
that
more
and
more
the
control
of
the
home
and
its
occupants
had
been
taken
over
fillery
himself
only
too
willing
by
his
assistant
a
moment
of
appalling
doubt
rose
like
a
black
cloud
he
heard
paul
telling
levallon
to
begin
his
breakfast
just
as
the
door
closed
and
he
noted
the
authoritative
tone
of
voice
the
next
minute
he
and
his
colleague
were
alone
together
paul
said
the
chief
quickly
but
with
a
calm
assurance
that
anticipated
a
favourable
answer
at
any
rate
are
all
right
devonham
nodded
his
head
no
harm
done
he
replied
briefly
in
fact
as
you
know
he
rather
stimulates
them
than
otherwise
i
know
he
felt
for
the
first
time
in
their
years
of
close
relationship
a
breath
of
suspicion
enter
him
there
was
a
look
upon
his
face
he
could
not
quite
define
it
baffled
him
of
course
i
know
he
stopped
for
the
undecipherable
look
had
strengthened
suddenly
he
thought
of
a
gaoler
paul
he
said
quickly
what
the
matter
what
wrong
with
you
he
drew
back
a
pace
or
two
and
watched
him
with
me
nothing
edward
nothing
at
all
the
tone
was
grave
with
anxiety
yet
had
this
new
authority
in
it
a
feeling
of
intolerable
insecurity
came
upon
him
a
sensation
as
though
he
balanced
on
air
yet
its
cause
its
origin
easily
explained
the
support
of
his
colleague
mind
was
taken
from
him
paul
attitude
was
clear
as
day
to
him
he
a
gaoler
he
recalled
again
the
recent
detail
brightly
significant
that
nurse
robbins
had
turned
to
paul
rather
than
to
himself
with
then
you
think
his
voice
hardly
sounded
like
his
own
he
looked
about
him
for
support
found
an
sat
down
in
it
you
strange
paul
very
strange
he
whispered
what
do
you
mean
by
something
wrong
with
devonham
expression
cleared
slightly
and
a
kindly
sympathetic
smile
appeared
then
vanished
the
grave
look
that
fillery
disliked
reappeared
what
mean
paul
devonham
came
the
repetition
in
a
louder
more
challenging
voice
you
watching
me
as
though
i
were
he
laughed
without
a
trace
of
mirth
a
patient
he
leaned
forward
paul
you
been
watching
me
for
a
long
time
out
with
it
now
what
is
it
devonham
who
had
kept
silent
drew
some
papers
from
his
pocket
a
bundle
of
rolled
sheets
of
course
he
said
gently
i
always
watch
you
for
that
how
i
learn
i
learn
from
you
edward
more
than
from
anybody
i
know
but
fillery
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
sheaf
of
papers
had
recognized
them
his
own
writing
was
visible
along
the
uneven
edges
they
were
the
description
he
had
set
down
of
his
adventure
on
flower
hill
of
the
scenes
between
and
lady
gleeson
between
and
nayan
the
autobiographical
description
with
and
nurse
robbins
soon
after
his
arrival
when
fillery
had
so
amazingly
found
his
own
mind
as
he
believed
identified
with
his
patient
devonham
snapped
off
the
elastic
band
that
held
the
sheaf
together
edward
i
read
them
we
have
no
secrets
of
course
i
read
them
carefully
every
word
my
dear
fellow
yes
yes
replied
the
other
while
something
in
him
wavered
horribly
i
glad
they
were
meant
for
you
to
read
for
of
course
we
have
no
secrets
i
i
do
not
expect
you
to
agree
we
have
never
quite
seen
eye
to
eye
have
we
his
voice
shook
you
terrible
iconoclast
he
added
betraying
thus
the
nature
of
the
fear
that
changed
his
voice
then
recognizing
with
vexation
that
he
had
done
so
you
believe
nothing
you
never
will
believe
anything
you
can
not
understand
with
joy
you
would
destroy
what
i
and
others
believe
would
you
paul
the
deep
sadness
the
gravity
on
the
face
in
front
of
him
stopped
the
tirade
i
would
save
you
edward
came
the
earnest
gentle
words
from
yourself
the
powers
of
as
we
know
in
our
practice
do
we
are
limitless
if
you
call
that
destroying
from
the
adjoining
room
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
was
audible
fillery
listened
a
moment
with
a
smile
paul
he
asked
his
voice
firm
and
sure
again
is
your
chief
patient
in
that
room
indicating
the
door
with
his
head
or
in
this
in
this
was
the
reply
a
wise
man
is
always
his
own
patient
and
heal
thyself
his
motto
he
sat
down
beside
his
chief
his
manner
changed
there
was
affection
deep
solicitude
something
of
passionate
entreaty
even
in
voice
and
eyes
and
gestures
there
are
features
here
he
said
in
lowered
tones
edward
we
have
not
understood
perhaps
even
we
can
never
understand
but
we
have
not
i
think
sufficiently
guarded
against
one
thing
the
rôle
it
plays
in
life
is
immense
incalculable
it
is
in
everything
we
do
and
think
above
all
in
everything
we
believe
it
is
peculiarly
powerful
and
active
in
er
unusual
things
the
sound
the
sounds
you
heard
them
yourself
broke
in
his
companion
devonham
shrugged
his
thin
shoulders
he
sings
in
a
peculiar
way
as
an
aside
he
said
it
returning
to
his
main
sermon
instantly
let
us
leave
details
out
he
cried
it
is
the
principle
that
concerns
us
edward
your
complex
against
humanity
lies
hard
and
rigid
in
you
still
it
has
never
found
that
full
recognition
by
yourself
which
can
resolve
it
your
work
your
noble
work
is
but
a
partial
expression
the
kernel
of
this
old
complex
in
you
remains
unrelieved
undischarged
because
still
unrecognized
and
further
you
are
continually
adding
to
the
repression
which
even
devonham
paused
a
second
before
using
such
a
word
to
such
a
man
is
poisoning
you
edward
poisoning
you
i
repeat
you
saw
you
saw
the
rebuilding
of
the
daisy
an
odd
whisper
of
insecurity
ran
through
the
quiet
words
a
statement
rather
than
a
question
you
realize
at
any
rate
that
chance
has
brought
us
into
contact
with
powers
creative
powers
of
a
new
order
let
us
omit
all
details
just
now
interrupted
the
other
a
troubled
indecipherable
look
on
his
face
the
undoubted
telepathy
between
your
mind
and
mine
nullifies
any
such
powers
of
which
we
all
have
some
faint
counterpart
at
any
rate
in
our
subliminal
selves
fillery
had
not
heard
the
interruption
powers
by
means
of
which
we
may
build
for
the
race
new
forms
new
mental
bodies
new
vehicles
for
life
for
god
to
manifest
through
more
perfect
more
receptive
devonham
had
suddenly
seized
both
his
hands
and
was
leaning
closer
to
him
something
compelling
authoritative
peculiarly
convincing
for
a
moment
had
its
undeniable
effect
again
stopping
the
flow
of
hurried
passionate
eager
words
there
is
one
new
form
new
body
and
the
intensity
in
voice
and
eyes
drove
the
meaning
deep
deep
into
his
listener
mind
and
heart
i
wish
to
see
you
build
one
and
one
only
physical
mental
spiritual
but
you
can
not
build
it
edward
alone
paul
the
other
held
up
a
warning
hand
the
expression
in
his
eyes
was
warning
too
their
effect
upon
devonham
however
was
nil
he
was
talking
with
a
purpose
nothing
could
alter
she
is
still
waiting
for
you
he
went
on
with
determination
and
already
you
have
kept
her
waiting
overlong
in
the
tone
in
the
hard
clear
eyes
as
well
lay
a
suggestion
almost
of
tears
he
opened
the
door
into
the
but
fillery
caught
his
arm
and
stopped
him
they
could
hear
nurse
robbins
speaking
as
she
attended
as
usual
to
her
patient
wants
coffee
was
being
poured
out
there
was
a
sound
of
knives
and
plates
and
cups
one
minute
paul
one
minute
before
we
go
in
he
drew
him
aside
and
what
devonham
may
i
ask
would
you
prescribe
there
was
a
curious
mixture
of
gentle
sarcasm
of
pity
of
patient
tolerance
yet
at
the
same
time
of
sincere
even
anxious
interest
in
the
question
the
face
and
manner
betrayed
that
he
waited
for
the
answer
with
something
more
than
curiosity
there
was
no
hesitancy
in
devonham
he
judged
the
moment
ripe
perhaps
he
was
aware
that
his
words
would
be
listened
to
appreciated
understood
certainly
and
possibly
obeyed
expression
he
said
convincingly
but
in
a
lowered
voice
the
fullest
expression
everywhere
and
always
let
it
all
come
accept
the
lot
believe
the
lot
welcome
the
lot
and
thus
he
could
not
conceal
the
note
of
passionate
entreaty
of
deep
affection
avoid
every
atom
of
in
the
end
in
the
long
run
your
own
best
judgment
prevail
they
smiled
into
each
other
eyes
for
a
moment
in
silence
while
instinctively
and
automatically
their
hands
joined
in
a
steady
clasp
bless
you
old
fellow
murmured
the
chief
as
if
i
did
know
the
treatment
you
been
trying
on
me
for
weeks
and
months
as
if
i
had
noticed
as
they
entered
the
nurse
robbins
with
flushed
face
and
sparkling
eyes
was
pouring
out
the
coffee
leaning
close
over
her
patient
shoulder
as
she
did
so
fresh
roses
were
in
her
cheeks
as
well
as
on
the
table
this
is
its
touch
upon
the
blossomed
maid
whispered
fillery
with
the
quick
hint
of
humour
that
belongs
only
to
the
sane
at
the
same
time
the
light
remark
was
produced
he
well
knew
by
a
part
of
himself
that
sought
to
remain
veiled
from
recognition
any
other
triviality
would
have
done
as
well
to
cloak
the
sharp
pain
that
swept
him
and
to
lead
his
listener
astray
for
in
that
instant
as
they
entered
he
saw
at
the
table
not
but
levallon
the
backward
ignorant
commonplace
levallon
an
empty
untaught
personality
yet
so
receptive
that
anything
could
be
transferred
to
him
by
a
strong
vivid
mind
a
mind
for
instance
like
his
own
the
sight
for
a
swift
instant
was
intolerable
and
devastating
he
balanced
again
on
air
that
gave
him
no
support
he
wavered
almost
swayed
in
that
horrible
and
painful
second
did
not
exist
and
never
had
existed
the
unstable
mind
he
comforted
himself
experiences
dislocating
extremes
of
attitude
for
at
the
same
time
as
he
saw
himself
shaking
and
wavering
without
solid
support
he
saw
the
figure
of
paul
devonham
big
important
authoritative
dominating
the
uncertainties
of
life
with
calm
steady
power
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
all
this
came
and
went
he
sat
down
beside
levallon
his
eyes
still
twinkling
with
his
trivial
little
joke
he
whispered
to
devonham
quickly
has
escaped
at
last
levallon
came
the
whispered
reply
as
quickly
is
cured
at
last
and
to
conceal
an
intolerable
rush
of
pain
of
loss
of
loneliness
that
threatened
tears
he
pointed
to
the
dropped
eyes
and
blushing
cheeks
of
the
pretty
nurse
across
the
table
chapter
xxvii
to
edward
fillery
the
deep
pain
of
frustration
baffling
all
his
mental
processes
the
end
had
come
with
a
strange
bewildering
swiftness
he
knew
there
had
been
a
prolonged
dislocation
of
his
being
possibly
even
a
partial
loss
of
memory
with
regard
to
much
that
went
on
about
him
but
he
could
not
did
not
admit
that
no
value
or
reality
had
attached
to
his
experiences
the
central
self
in
him
had
projected
a
limb
an
arm
that
feeling
its
way
across
the
confining
wall
of
the
prison
house
groping
towards
an
unbelievably
wonderful
revelation
of
new
possibilities
had
abruptly
now
withdrawn
again
the
dissociation
in
his
personality
was
over
he
was
in
other
words
no
longer
aware
of
like
devonham
he
now
did
not
perceive
but
only
levallon
but
unlike
devonham
he
perceived
him
he
had
met
a
mighty
and
magnificent
vision
its
truth
and
beauty
remained
for
him
enduring
the
revelation
had
come
and
gone
that
its
close
was
sudden
simple
undramatic
above
all
untheatrical
satisfied
him
had
escaped
leaving
the
commonplace
levallon
in
his
place
but
at
least
he
had
known
his
whole
being
an
odd
sweet
happy
pain
in
him
yearned
ever
to
the
glorious
memory
of
it
all
the
melancholy
the
peculiar
shyness
he
felt
were
not
without
an
indefinite
pleasure
his
nature
still
vibrated
to
those
haunting
and
inspiring
rhythms
but
his
normal
earthly
faculties
he
flattered
himself
were
in
no
sense
permanently
disorganized
professionally
he
still
cared
for
levallon
disenchanted
dust
though
he
might
be
compared
to
he
approved
of
devonham
proposal
to
take
him
for
a
few
days
to
the
sea
he
also
approved
of
paul
advice
that
he
should
accept
father
invitation
to
spend
a
day
or
two
at
his
country
cottage
the
khilkoffs
would
be
there
father
and
daughter
the
home
in
charge
of
an
assistant
could
be
reached
in
a
few
hours
in
case
of
need
the
magic
of
devonham
wise
controlling
touch
lay
in
every
detail
it
seemed
he
saw
the
trio
for
nurse
robbins
was
of
the
party
off
to
seaford
the
final
touches
to
his
cure
paul
mentioned
slyly
with
a
smile
as
the
guard
whistled
but
of
whose
cure
he
did
not
explain
he
bathe
in
the
sea
he
added
the
reference
obvious
this
time
and
when
we
return
i
shall
be
best
man
i
already
promised
there
was
a
triumph
of
skilled
wisdom
in
both
sentences
the
time
is
ripe
yet
edward
for
too
magnificent
ideas
and
your
ideas
have
been
a
shade
too
magnificent
perhaps
he
talked
on
lightly
even
carelessly
and
as
usual
there
was
purpose
meaning
treatment
his
friend
easily
discerned
it
now
in
every
detail
of
his
attitude
fillery
laughed
through
his
mind
ran
povey
sentence
never
argue
with
the
but
aloud
he
said
at
any
rate
i
no
idea
that
i
emperor
of
japan
or
or
the
archangel
gabriel
and
the
other
pleased
and
satisfied
that
a
touch
of
humour
showed
itself
shook
hands
firmly
affectionately
through
the
window
as
the
train
moved
off
levallon
raised
his
hat
to
his
chief
and
smiled
an
ordinary
smile
with
the
speed
and
incongruity
of
a
dream
these
few
days
slipped
by
their
happenings
vivid
enough
yet
all
set
to
a
curiously
small
scale
a
cramped
perspective
blurred
a
little
as
by
a
fading
light
only
one
thing
retained
its
brilliance
its
intense
reality
its
place
in
the
bigger
scale
its
vast
perspective
remaining
unchanged
the
same
immense
sweet
rhythm
swept
iraida
and
himself
inevitably
together
some
deep
obsession
that
hitherto
prevented
had
been
withdrawn
she
had
called
that
very
morning
paul
touch
visible
here
again
he
believed
though
he
had
not
asked
he
looked
on
and
smiled
after
the
ordeal
of
breakfast
with
devonham
and
levallon
her
visit
was
announced
it
was
paul
after
a
little
talk
downstairs
who
showed
her
in
with
the
radiance
of
a
spring
opening
to
the
early
sunshine
her
unexpected
visit
to
his
study
seemed
clothed
unexpected
yes
but
surely
inevitable
as
well
with
the
sweet
morning
wind
through
the
open
window
it
seemed
she
came
to
him
the
letter
of
invitation
from
father
collins
in
her
hand
his
own
lay
among
his
correspondence
still
untouched
her
perfume
rose
about
him
as
she
explained
something
he
hardly
heard
or
followed
you
come
edward
wo
you
you
come
too
of
course
he
answered
but
it
was
a
song
he
heard
and
no
dull
spoken
words
she
ran
dancing
towards
him
through
a
million
flowers
her
hair
flew
loose
along
the
scented
winds
her
white
limbs
glowed
with
fire
he
danced
to
meet
her
it
was
in
the
valley
that
he
caught
her
hands
and
met
her
eyes
it
happened
he
heard
himself
saying
it
happened
at
last
just
as
you
said
it
must
he
has
escaped
but
we
shall
follow
after
when
the
time
comes
edward
where
the
wild
bee
never
flew
when
the
time
comes
she
repeated
her
voice
her
smile
her
eyes
brought
him
back
sharply
into
the
little
room
the
furniture
showed
up
again
the
valley
faded
he
noticed
suddenly
that
for
the
first
time
she
wore
no
flowers
in
her
dress
as
usual
iraida
he
exclaimed
then
you
knew
she
bent
her
head
smiling
divinely
she
took
both
his
hands
in
hers
at
her
touch
every
obstacle
between
them
melted
his
own
private
personal
inhibition
he
saw
as
the
trivial
barriers
a
little
child
might
raise
his
complex
against
humanity
as
paul
called
it
had
disappeared
their
minds
their
beings
their
natures
became
most
strangely
one
he
felt
and
yet
quite
naturally
there
was
nothing
they
did
not
share
with
the
first
dawn
he
heard
her
say
in
a
low
voice
never
never
again
he
seemed
to
hear
shall
we
destroy
his
their
work
of
ages
a
flower
he
whispered
has
no
need
to
wear
a
flower
he
was
convinced
that
she
too
had
shared
an
experience
similar
to
his
own
perhaps
had
even
seen
the
bright
marvellous
deva
faces
peering
shining
he
did
not
ask
she
said
no
more
life
flowed
between
them
in
an
untroubled
stream
like
the
flow
of
a
stream
indeed
things
went
past
him
yet
with
incidents
and
bits
of
conversation
thus
picked
out
with
vivid
sharpness
the
dissociation
of
his
being
was
still
noticeable
here
and
there
he
supposed
the
swell
after
the
storm
took
time
to
settle
down
slowly
however
the
waves
that
had
been
projected
leaping
to
heaven
returned
to
the
safe
quiet
dead
level
of
the
normal
calm
the
depths
lay
still
once
more
and
his
melancholy
passed
a
little
lifted
he
knew
at
any
rate
those
depths
were
now
accessible
i
seen
over
the
wall
a
moment
he
said
to
himself
paul
is
both
right
and
wrong
what
i
seen
lies
too
far
ahead
of
the
race
to
be
intelligible
or
of
use
i
should
be
cast
out
crucified
my
other
simpler
work
destroyed
to
control
rhythms
so
powerful
so
different
to
anything
we
now
know
is
not
yet
possible
they
would
shatter
rather
than
construct
he
smiled
sadly
yet
with
resignation
there
was
pain
and
humour
in
his
eyes
i
should
be
regarded
as
a
promethean
merely
an
extremist
promethean
and
probably
be
locked
up
for
contravening
some
county
council
or
offending
church
and
state
where
he
perhaps
is
right
paul
he
thought
of
him
with
affection
and
pity
with
understanding
love
how
wise
and
faithful
how
patient
and
how
skilled
within
his
limits
the
stable
are
the
useful
the
stable
are
the
leaders
the
stable
rule
the
world
people
with
steady
if
unvisioned
eyes
like
paul
with
money
like
lady
gleeson
but
oh
he
sighed
how
slow
ye
gods
how
slow
the
visit
was
a
strange
one
nayan
sat
between
him
and
her
father
in
the
motor
it
was
not
far
from
london
the
ancient
little
house
among
the
trees
where
father
collins
secreted
himself
from
time
to
time
upon
occasional
retreats
within
the
grounds
it
might
have
been
the
centre
of
the
new
forest
but
for
the
sound
of
tramcar
bells
that
sometimes
came
jangling
faintly
through
the
thick
screen
of
leaves
there
were
paved
courtyards
with
sweet
playing
fountains
miniature
lawns
tangles
of
flowers
small
sunken
gardens
with
birds
of
cut
box
and
yew
stone
nymphs
and
a
shaggy
pan
whose
hand
that
once
held
the
pipes
had
broken
off
suburbia
lay
outside
yet
by
walking
wisely
it
was
possible
to
move
among
these
delights
for
half
an
hour
great
trees
ever
rustling
overhead
and
a
clear
small
stream
winding
peacefully
in
and
out
with
gentle
lapping
murmurs
nature
here
lay
undisturbed
as
it
had
lain
for
centuries
the
little
ancient
house
moreover
seemed
to
have
grown
up
with
the
green
things
out
of
the
soil
so
naturally
it
all
belonged
together
the
garden
ran
indoors
it
seemed
through
open
doors
and
windows
butterflies
floated
from
courtyard
into
and
out
again
leaves
blew
through
windows
scurrying
to
another
little
bit
of
lawn
the
sun
and
wind
even
the
fountains
spray
found
the
walls
no
obstacle
as
though
unaware
of
them
bees
murmured
swallows
hung
below
the
eaves
it
was
indeed
a
healing
spot
a
natural
retreat
i
really
believe
the
river
rises
in
your
library
exclaimed
fillery
after
a
tour
of
inspection
with
his
host
and
my
bedroom
is
in
the
heart
of
that
big
chestnut
across
the
lawn
do
my
feet
touch
carpet
grass
or
bark
when
i
get
out
of
bed
in
the
morning
i
learnt
more
here
began
father
collins
than
at
all
the
conferences
and
learned
meetings
i
ever
attended
the
group
of
four
stood
in
the
twilight
by
the
playing
fountain
where
the
dignified
stone
pan
watched
the
paved
little
court
listening
to
the
splash
of
the
water
and
the
wind
droning
among
the
leaves
the
lap
of
the
winding
stream
came
faintly
to
them
the
stillness
cast
a
spell
about
them
dropping
a
screen
against
the
outer
world
hark
said
father
collins
holding
a
curved
hand
to
his
ear
you
hear
the
music
in
the
leafy
greenwood
lone
sit
you
rustic
pan
and
drone
on
a
dulcet
resonant
reed
he
paused
peering
across
to
the
stone
figure
as
for
an
answer
all
stood
listening
waiting
only
wind
and
water
breaking
the
silence
the
bats
were
now
flitting
overhead
hung
the
saffron
arch
of
fading
sunset
in
a
deep
ringing
voice
very
gruff
and
very
low
father
collins
gave
the
answer
that
yonder
cows
may
feed
up
the
dewy
mountain
passes
gathering
the
feathered
grasses
that
pan
work
he
said
laughing
pleasantly
pan
and
all
his
splendid
hierarchy
always
at
work
though
invisibly
with
music
colour
beauty
it
was
scraps
like
this
that
stood
out
in
fillery
memory
adding
to
his
conviction
that
paul
had
enlisted
even
this
strange
priest
in
his
plan
each
man
is
saturated
with
certain
ideas
thoughts
phrases
in
a
line
of
his
own
these
constitute
his
groove
to
go
outside
it
makes
him
feel
homeless
and
uncomfortable
accustomed
to
its
measurements
and
safe
within
them
he
interprets
all
he
hears
reads
observes
according
to
his
particular
familiar
shibboleths
to
which
as
to
a
standard
of
infallible
criticism
he
brings
slavishly
all
that
is
offered
for
the
consideration
of
his
judgment
a
new
idea
stands
little
chance
of
being
comprehended
much
less
adopted
tell
him
new
things
about
the
stars
the
stock
exchange
the
stigmata
up
crops
his
standard
of
approval
or
disapproval
he
can
not
help
himself
his
judgment
based
upon
the
limited
content
of
his
groove
operates
automatically
he
condemns
an
entirely
new
idea
is
barely
glanced
at
before
it
is
rejected
for
the
rubbish
heap
how
then
can
progress
come
swiftly
to
a
race
composed
of
such
individuals
governs
everything
he
who
has
original
ideas
is
outcast
and
dwells
lonely
as
the
moon
how
slow
ye
gods
how
slow
only
fillery
could
not
remember
could
not
be
certain
whether
it
was
his
host
or
himself
that
used
the
words
father
collins
as
usual
was
saying
all
sorts
of
things
but
addressed
himself
surely
to
old
khilkoff
most
of
the
time
the
russian
half
angry
half
amused
growling
out
his
comments
and
replies
as
he
sat
smoking
heavily
and
enjoying
the
peaceful
night
scene
in
his
own
fashion
it
was
odd
none
the
less
how
much
that
the
wild
priest
gabbled
coincided
with
his
own
with
fillery
thoughts
at
the
moment
a
peculiar
melancholy
a
mood
of
shyness
never
known
before
lay
still
upon
him
the
beauty
of
the
silent
girl
beside
him
overpowered
him
a
little
too
wonderful
to
hold
to
own
she
seemed
yet
they
were
deliciously
uncannily
akin
all
his
former
denials
and
suppressions
hesitations
and
refusals
had
vanished
he
wondered
had
provided
him
with
the
fullest
expression
he
had
ever
known
a
boundless
relief
poured
over
him
he
was
aware
of
wholesome
desire
rising
behind
his
old
high
admiration
and
respect
he
watched
her
once
standing
close
to
pan
broken
outline
among
the
shadows
touching
the
mossy
arm
with
white
fingers
and
he
imagined
for
an
instant
that
she
held
the
vanished
pipes
after
an
experience
with
other
beings
father
collins
endless
drone
floated
to
him
shyness
they
say
is
felt
silence
descends
upon
the
whole
nature
to
which
a
little
later
came
the
growling
comment
with
its
foreign
accent
talk
may
be
pleasurable
sometimes
but
it
is
profitable
rarely
the
talk
flowed
past
and
over
him
occasional
phrases
like
islands
rising
out
of
a
stream
inviting
his
attention
momentarily
to
land
and
listen
the
girl
he
now
saw
no
longer
stood
beside
the
broken
stone
figure
she
was
wandering
idly
towards
the
farther
garden
and
the
trees
he
burned
to
rise
and
go
to
her
but
something
held
him
what
was
it
what
could
it
be
some
strange
hard
little
obstacle
prevented
then
suddenly
he
knew
what
it
was
that
stopped
him
he
was
waiting
for
that
familiar
pet
sentence
once
he
heard
that
the
impetus
to
move
the
power
to
overcome
his
strange
shyness
the
certainty
that
his
whole
being
was
at
last
one
with
itself
again
would
come
to
him
it
made
him
laugh
inwardly
while
he
recognized
the
validity
of
the
detail
final
symptoms
of
the
obstructing
inhibitions
of
the
obstinate
original
complex
the
outline
of
the
girl
was
lost
now
merged
in
the
shadows
beyond
he
stirred
but
could
not
get
up
to
go
a
fury
of
impatience
burned
in
him
father
collins
he
felt
dawdled
outrageously
he
was
talking
jawing
fillery
called
it
about
extraordinary
experiences
gradually
as
consciousness
more
and
more
often
extends
the
organs
to
record
such
extensions
will
be
formed
you
see
if
our
inventive
faculties
were
turned
inwards
instead
of
outwards
for
gain
and
comfort
as
they
now
are
we
might
know
the
gods
the
sculptor
growl
though
the
words
were
this
time
inaudible
had
a
bite
in
them
the
other
voice
poured
on
like
thick
slow
oil
what
anyhow
is
it
then
that
urges
us
on
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
denials
failures
then
came
something
that
seemed
leading
up
to
the
pet
sentence
that
was
the
signal
he
waited
for
nearer
to
it
at
any
rate
it
childish
surely
to
go
on
merely
seeking
more
of
what
we
have
already
we
should
seek
something
new
a
call
it
seemed
came
to
him
on
the
wind
from
the
dark
trees
but
still
he
could
not
move
but
at
last
out
of
a
prolonged
jumble
of
the
two
voices
one
growling
the
other
high
pitched
came
the
signal
he
somehow
waited
for
even
now
however
the
speaker
delayed
it
as
long
as
possible
he
was
doing
it
of
course
on
purpose
this
was
intentional
obviously
yes
but
a
thing
out
of
its
right
place
is
without
power
life
means
of
expression
robbed
of
its
context
which
alone
gives
it
meaning
robbed
so
to
speak
of
its
arms
and
legs
a
there
at
least
was
the
definite
proof
that
father
collins
was
doing
this
of
deliberate
set
purpose
go
on
yes
but
for
god
sake
say
it
i
want
to
be
off
fillery
believed
he
shrieked
the
words
but
apparently
they
were
inaudible
they
remained
unnoticed
at
any
rate
hence
the
value
of
order
tidiness
you
see
often
a
misplaced
thing
is
invisible
until
replaced
where
it
belongs
it
is
as
we
say
lost
no
movement
is
meaningless
no
walk
without
purpose
all
your
movements
tend
towards
your
proper
place
a
breeze
blew
the
fountain
spray
aside
so
that
its
splashing
ceased
for
a
brief
second
from
the
rustling
leaves
beyond
came
a
faint
murmur
as
of
distant
piping
but
into
the
second
pause
had
leaped
the
pet
sentence
only
a
being
in
his
place
is
the
ruler
of
his
fate
the
signal
he
was
aware
that
the
russian
cleared
his
throat
and
spat
unmusically
aware
also
that
father
collins
a
queer
smile
just
discernible
on
his
face
in
the
gloom
turned
his
head
with
a
gesture
that
might
well
have
been
an
understanding
nod
both
sound
and
gesture
however
were
already
behind
him
he
was
released
he
was
across
the
paved
courtyard
past
the
fountain
past
the
stone
figure
of
the
silent
old
rough
god
and
off
and
as
he
went
finding
his
way
instinctively
among
the
dark
trees
that
pet
sentence
went
with
him
like
a
clarion
call
as
though
sweet
piping
music
played
it
everywhere
about
him
a
thousand
memories
shut
down
with
a
final
snap
in
the
stage
of
his
mind
came
a
upon
a
host
of
inhibitions
there
was
an
immense
and
glorious
sense
of
relief
as
though
bitter
knots
were
suddenly
disentangled
and
some
iron
kernel
of
resistance
that
had
weighted
him
for
years
flowed
freely
at
last
in
a
stream
of
happy
molten
gold
he
found
her
easily
where
the
trees
thinned
at
the
farther
edge
he
saw
her
figure
long
before
he
came
up
with
her
outlined
against
the
fading
saffron
he
saw
her
turn
he
saw
her
arms
outstretched
he
came
up
with
her
the
same
minute
and
they
stood
in
silence
for
a
long
time
watching
the
darkness
bend
and
sink
upon
the
landscape
for
here
at
this
one
edge
of
the
tiny
estate
the
real
open
country
showed
beyond
them
in
the
twilight
lay
the
silent
fields
like
a
gigantic
brown
and
yellow
carpet
whose
shaken
folds
still
seemed
to
tremble
and
run
on
beneath
the
growing
moon
along
a
farther
ridge
the
trees
and
hedges
passed
in
a
ragged
procession
of
strange
figures
defined
sharply
against
the
sky
witches
queens
and
goblins
on
the
prowl
the
ancient
fairyland
of
the
english
countryside
they
still
stood
silent
side
by
side
touching
almost
their
heat
and
perfume
and
atmosphere
intermingling
looking
out
across
the
quiet
scene
he
was
aware
that
her
mind
stole
into
his
most
sweetly
and
that
without
knowing
it
his
hand
had
found
her
own
and
that
presently
she
leaned
a
little
against
him
their
eyes
their
mental
sight
as
well
saw
the
same
things
he
knew
the
first
stars
peeped
out
and
they
looked
up
at
them
as
one
being
looks
together
the
wonder
that
you
saw
in
him
he
heard
himself
saying
it
was
a
statement
not
a
question
was
yourself
of
course
her
voice
like
his
own
in
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
came
softly
it
continued
his
own
thought
rather
than
replied
to
it
the
part
you
held
down
and
hidden
away
all
these
years
her
divination
came
to
him
with
staggering
effect
you
always
knew
then
always
the
first
day
we
met
you
took
me
into
the
firm
he
was
aware
that
everything
about
him
pulsed
and
throbbed
with
life
intelligence
in
every
stick
and
stone
angelic
beings
marched
on
their
wondrous
business
through
the
sky
a
mighty
host
pursued
their
endless
service
with
a
network
of
huge
and
tiny
rhythms
the
spirals
of
creative
fire
soared
and
danced
the
moon
emerged
sailing
sailing
as
though
no
wind
could
stop
her
lovely
flight
she
fled
the
stars
themselves
the
clouds
turned
round
to
look
at
her
as
clearing
their
hair
she
passed
onwards
with
her
radiant
smile
heading
into
the
bare
bosom
of
the
sky
she
blazed
in
her
triumph
of
loneliness
her
icy
prow
set
towards
some
far
unknown
unearthly
goal
which
is
the
reason
why
men
love
her
so
and
my
theories
our
theories
he
murmured
into
the
ear
against
his
lips
the
way
that
has
been
shown
to
us
both
arms
were
now
about
her
and
he
held
her
so
close
that
her
words
were
but
a
warm
perfumed
breath
to
cover
his
face
as
her
hair
was
covering
his
eyes
we
shall
follow
it
together
dear
it
was
as
if
some
angel
stepping
down
the
sky
came
near
enough
to
fold
them
in
a
great
rhythm
of
fire
and
wind
bright
mighty
faces
in
a
crowd
rose
round
them
and
through
her
hair
he
saw
familiar
visible
outlines
of
all
the
common
things
melt
out
showing
for
one
gorgeous
instant
the
flashings
and
whirlings
that
was
the
workshop
of
their
deathless
service
look
look
he
whispered
pointing
from
the
darkening
earth
to
the
stars
and
sailing
moon
above
they
everywhere
you
can
see
them
too
the
bright
messengers
for
answer
she
came
yet
closer
against
his
side
holding
him
more
tightly
to
her
lifting
her
lips
to
his
so
that
in
her
very
eyes
he
saw
the
marvellous
fire
shine
and
flash
we
shall
build
together
you
and
i
she
whispered
very
softly
and
with
their
help
the
sweetest
and
most
perfect
body
ever
known
but
behind
the
magic
of
her
words
and
voice
behind
their
meaning
and
the
steadying
understanding
sympathy
he
easily
divined
he
heard
another
sound
familiar
as
a
dream
yet
fraught
with
some
haunting
significance
he
already
was
forgetting
almost
entirely
forgotten
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
it
seemed
to
rise
a
magnificent
deep
stupendous
rhythm
that
created
at
least
the
impression
of
a
voice
i
weave
and
i
weave
rolled
forth
as
though
the
planet
uttered
he
stood
waiting
transfixed
listening
intently
you
heard
he
whispered
everything
she
said
tight
in
his
arms
at
once
again
her
lips
on
his
the
very
beating
of
your
heart
your
inmost
thoughts
