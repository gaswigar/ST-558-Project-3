heart
burnings
she
did
not
want
to
hate
the
girls
indeed
since
she
loved
them
all
it
would
go
particularly
hard
with
her
if
she
had
to
hate
them
love
turned
to
hate
is
such
a
virulent
product
but
certainly
she
had
never
found
it
so
hard
to
be
patient
with
them
they
were
all
five
her
college
classmates
of
only
last
year
class
and
it
was
dear
and
kind
of
them
to
drive
out
here
into
the
country
to
see
her
coming
in
phyllis
porter
great
family
limousine
the
prettiest
jolliest
little
crowd
imaginable
they
had
been
thoughtful
enough
to
warn
her
that
they
were
coming
too
so
that
she
could
set
the
old
manse
in
its
pleasantest
order
build
a
crackling
fire
in
the
fireplace
and
get
out
her
best
thin
china
and
silver
with
which
to
serve
afternoon
tea
she
made
it
chocolate
with
vivid
recollection
of
their
tastes
and
added
deliciously
substantial
though
delicate
sandwiches
with
plenty
of
the
fruitiest
and
nuttiest
kinds
of
little
cakes
she
had
donned
the
one
real
afternoon
frock
she
possessed
a
clever
out
of
nothing
in
particular
altogether
when
she
greeted
her
guests
as
they
ran
and
after
the
manner
of
their
kind
into
her
welcoming
arms
she
had
seemed
to
them
absolutely
the
old
georgiana
they
had
brought
her
a
wonderful
box
of
red
roses
and
phyllis
had
caught
her
kissing
one
of
the
great
silky
buds
as
she
put
it
with
the
rest
in
a
bowl
i
do
believe
she
seen
a
hothouse
rose
since
she
left
college
thought
phyllis
with
a
stab
of
pity
at
her
tender
heart
but
for
the
first
hour
of
their
stay
georgiana
had
been
her
gay
and
brilliant
self
flinging
quips
and
jests
broadcast
asking
impertinent
questions
making
saucy
comments
quite
as
of
old
it
was
only
when
dot
manning
toward
the
end
of
the
visit
began
a
sober
tale
of
the
misfortunes
which
had
come
thronging
into
the
life
of
one
of
their
classmates
that
georgiana
face
sobering
into
sympathetic
gravity
betrayed
to
her
companions
a
curious
change
which
had
come
upon
it
since
they
saw
it
last
meanwhile
in
answer
to
her
questioning
they
had
told
her
all
about
themselves
phyllis
porter
and
celia
winters
were
having
a
glorious
season
in
society
theo
crossman
was
deep
in
settlement
work
crazy
over
it
was
of
course
the
phrase
dot
manning
was
going
abroad
next
week
for
a
year
of
travel
in
all
sorts
of
beguiling
places
as
for
madge
sylvester
who
was
getting
ready
to
be
married
after
easter
the
first
of
the
class
she
sat
mostly
in
a
dreamy
smiling
silence
looking
into
the
fire
while
the
others
talked
no
georgiana
did
not
want
to
hate
the
girls
but
before
their
stay
was
over
she
found
herself
coming
dangerously
near
it
temporarily
at
least
they
were
dears
of
course
but
they
were
so
content
with
themselves
and
so
pitiful
of
her
not
of
course
that
they
meant
to
let
her
see
this
but
it
showed
in
spite
of
them
they
wanted
to
know
what
she
did
with
herself
whether
there
were
any
young
people
and
any
good
times
going
on
georgiana
led
them
to
the
window
just
at
this
point
and
pointed
out
to
them
a
vigorous
young
man
striding
by
in
ulster
and
soft
hat
who
looked
up
and
waved
as
he
passed
showing
one
of
those
fine
and
manly
young
faces
glowing
with
health
and
hopefulness
which
always
challenge
interest
from
girlhood
oh
have
you
many
like
that
celia
had
asked
and
when
georgiana
had
owned
that
james
stuart
was
the
only
one
precisely
like
that
dot
had
inquired
if
stuart
belonged
to
georgiana
and
being
answered
in
the
negative
shook
her
head
and
sighed
one
swallow
make
a
summer
jan
but
i
doubt
it
theodora
crossman
the
settlement
worker
inquired
particularly
whether
georgiana
were
doing
anything
worth
while
using
that
pregnant
modern
phrase
which
has
been
decidedly
overworked
yet
which
hardly
can
be
spared
from
the
vocabulary
worth
while
cried
georgiana
flashing
into
flame
in
an
instant
in
the
way
they
knew
so
well
worth
while
yes
you
have
seen
my
father
have
you
ever
it
a
pity
this
happens
to
be
one
of
his
bad
days
for
he
be
a
good
and
sufficient
answer
to
that
question
father
davy
is
one
of
the
lord
own
saints
on
earth
and
he
possesses
a
magnificent
sense
of
humour
which
not
all
saints
do
you
know
to
love
him
is
a
liberal
education
and
to
take
care
of
him
is
better
while
than
to
have
any
number
of
fingers
in
other
people
pies
of
course
dear
theo
had
answered
soothingly
we
know
nothing
in
the
world
so
well
worth
while
as
looking
after
one
father
and
mother
your
mother
died
long
ago
did
she
dear
and
your
father
would
be
dreadfully
lonely
without
you
at
the
same
time
it
seem
as
if
he
could
absorb
all
your
energies
you
remember
the
splendid
things
professor
nichols
used
to
say
about
the
duty
of
the
college
girl
after
college
particularly
in
a
small
town
i
suppose
you
have
no
foreigners
here
but
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
find
quite
a
wonderful
field
for
your
endeavour
in
stimulating
the
women
of
the
place
into
clubs
for
study
and
work
it
a
curious
exclamation
from
her
hostess
caused
miss
crossman
to
pause
in
fact
they
all
stared
wonderingly
at
georgiana
she
stood
upon
the
hearthrug
her
colour
usually
ready
to
glow
in
her
dusky
face
now
receding
suggestively
her
dark
eyes
sparkling
dangerously
the
only
trouble
with
that
sort
of
thing
she
answered
with
suspicious
quietness
or
rather
the
two
troubles
with
it
are
these
in
the
first
place
the
women
have
pretty
nearly
a
club
apiece
already
which
suits
them
much
better
than
anything
i
could
them
to
and
in
the
second
place
i
have
a
wonderful
field
for
my
endeavour
as
you
call
it
theo
did
you
crib
that
phrase
in
the
upper
regions
of
my
own
home
i
in
fact
i
may
be
said
to
belong
to
the
i
one
of
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
jan
you
have
gone
into
anything
crazy
dot
was
beginning
when
georgiana
obeying
an
impulse
walked
away
from
her
hearthrug
toward
the
door
beckoning
her
guests
to
follow
come
on
she
invited
since
you
have
so
poor
an
opinion
of
the
possibilities
for
serious
labour
in
a
world
of
woe
offered
by
my
residence
in
a
small
country
village
you
may
come
and
see
for
yourselves
they
came
after
her
with
a
rustle
and
flutter
of
frocks
and
a
patter
of
smartly
shod
feet
up
the
old
staircase
through
a
chilly
and
unfurnished
upper
hall
and
up
a
still
chillier
narrow
second
staircase
into
an
attic
region
which
could
hardly
be
properly
characterized
as
chilly
for
the
reason
that
the
atmosphere
there
was
frankly
freezing
as
near
as
possible
to
the
gable
window
stood
a
monster
structure
the
nature
of
which
the
beholders
did
not
instantly
recognize
phyllis
was
the
first
to
cry
out
a
loom
it
must
be
a
very
old
one
too
oh
how
fascinating
what
do
you
make
jan
fabrics
rugs
explained
georgiana
pulling
at
a
pile
upon
the
floor
such
rugs
as
these
good
looking
yes
dear
classmates
stunning
cried
madge
sylvester
with
a
smothered
shiver
at
the
penetrating
cold
of
the
place
simply
wonderful
too
clever
for
anything
and
oh
jan
do
you
make
them
to
sell
can
i
buy
this
one
i
wild
over
this
dull
blue
and
indian
red
came
tumbling
from
the
mouths
of
the
eager
girls
as
in
the
fading
light
from
the
attic
window
they
examined
the
rugs
there
was
sincerity
in
their
voices
georgiana
had
known
there
would
be
she
was
sure
of
the
art
and
skill
plainly
to
be
found
in
her
product
i
afraid
not
phyl
these
are
all
orders
and
i
weeks
behind
they
go
to
certain
exclusive
city
shops
and
i
have
all
i
can
do
you
must
have
struck
a
gold
mine
i
so
glad
congratulated
phyllis
well
not
exactly
it
rather
slow
work
when
you
do
housework
too
acknowledged
georgiana
however
it
does
very
well
it
keeps
us
in
firewood
and
oysters
for
the
winter
she
instantly
regretted
this
speech
for
it
led
presently
as
she
might
have
known
it
would
to
delicately
worded
expressions
of
hope
that
she
would
in
the
future
give
her
friends
the
pleasure
of
purchasing
her
wares
down
by
the
fireplace
again
georgiana
turned
upon
them
in
her
old
jesting
way
which
yet
had
in
it
as
they
all
felt
a
quality
which
was
new
stop
it
girls
no
i
not
sell
one
of
you
a
rug
of
any
size
shape
or
colour
i
far
behind
as
i
told
you
but
i
send
madge
a
gorgeous
one
for
a
wedding
present
if
she
tell
me
her
preferences
and
i
do
the
same
for
each
of
you
when
you
meet
your
fates
now
stop
talking
about
it
i
only
showed
you
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
a
busy
world
for
me
as
well
as
for
you
and
that
i
very
content
in
it
dot
do
you
want
just
one
more
of
these
fruitkins
by
the
way
since
you
like
them
so
much
i
give
you
the
recipe
i
made
it
up
was
it
clever
of
me
you
much
the
cleverest
of
us
all
anyway
murmured
dot
meekly
nibbling
at
the
delicious
morsel
while
her
hostess
rapidly
wrote
out
a
little
formula
and
gave
it
to
her
with
a
smile
they
were
soon
off
after
that
for
the
early
winter
twilight
was
upon
them
and
the
lights
in
the
waiting
car
outside
suddenly
came
on
with
a
suggestive
completeness
georgiana
assisted
her
guests
into
luxurious
coats
and
capes
made
of
or
lined
with
chinchilla
with
otter
with
sable
handed
gloves
and
muffs
and
listened
to
all
manner
of
affectionate
parting
speeches
every
one
of
which
contained
pressing
invitations
for
visits
short
or
long
each
girl
made
promises
of
future
calls
and
professed
herself
eager
to
come
and
stay
with
georgiana
at
any
time
then
the
whole
group
went
away
on
a
little
warm
breeze
of
and
human
kindness
they
are
dears
admitted
georgiana
as
she
waved
her
arm
at
the
departing
car
but
oh
i
ca
stand
having
them
sorry
for
me
the
old
manse
shabby
and
every
girl
of
them
knew
how
many
times
this
frock
has
been
made
over
i
saw
celia
recognize
it
even
through
its
dye
no
wonder
when
it
been
at
every
college
tea
she
ever
gave
but
i
wo
be
pitied
the
door
opened
and
a
slender
figure
in
an
came
slowly
into
the
firelit
room
georgiana
turned
quickly
father
davy
do
you
feel
better
if
i
known
it
i
have
brought
you
in
to
meet
the
girls
they
would
have
enjoyed
you
so
i
not
quite
up
to
meeting
the
girls
perhaps
daughter
but
decidedly
better
and
correspondingly
cheerful
have
you
had
a
good
time
he
placed
himself
as
carefully
as
possible
upon
the
couch
by
the
fire
and
his
daughter
tucked
him
up
in
an
old
plaid
shawl
which
had
lain
folded
upon
it
she
dropped
upon
the
hearthrug
and
sat
looking
into
the
fire
while
her
father
regarded
the
picture
she
made
in
the
dyed
frock
now
a
soft
indian
red
a
hue
which
pleased
his
eye
and
brought
out
all
her
gypsy
colouring
the
head
upon
the
couch
pillow
was
topped
with
a
soft
mass
of
curly
gray
hair
the
face
below
was
thin
and
pale
but
the
eyes
which
rested
upon
the
girl
were
the
clearest
youngest
eyes
that
ever
spoke
mutely
of
the
spirit
triumph
over
the
body
one
had
but
to
glance
at
david
warne
to
understand
that
here
was
a
man
who
was
no
less
a
man
because
he
had
to
spend
many
hours
of
every
day
upon
his
tortured
back
it
was
three
years
since
he
had
been
forced
to
lay
aside
the
care
of
the
parish
of
which
he
had
been
minister
but
he
had
given
up
not
a
whit
of
his
interest
in
his
fellowmen
and
now
that
he
could
seldom
go
to
them
he
had
taught
them
to
come
to
him
so
that
the
old
manse
was
almost
as
much
a
centre
of
the
village
interest
and
affection
as
it
had
been
when
its
master
went
freely
in
and
out
a
new
manse
had
been
built
nearer
the
church
for
the
new
man
and
the
old
house
left
to
warne
undisputed
possession
proof
positive
of
his
place
in
the
hearts
of
the
community
a
good
time
murmured
georgiana
in
answer
to
the
question
no
a
hateful
envious
time
disguised
as
much
as
might
be
under
a
frivolous
manner
the
girls
were
lovely
and
i
was
a
perfect
fiend
warne
did
not
seem
in
the
least
disconcerted
by
this
startling
statement
the
sounds
i
heard
did
not
strike
me
as
indicating
the
presence
of
any
fiend
he
suggested
probably
not
i
managed
to
avoid
giving
in
to
the
temptation
to
snatch
phyl
sumptuous
chinchilla
coat
madge
perfectly
adorable
hat
bronze
shoes
dot
embroidered
silk
handbag
and
bess
collar
and
cuffs
it
was
a
matter
of
clothes
then
how
much
men
escape
mused
warne
now
i
can
never
recall
hearing
any
man
young
or
old
express
a
longing
to
denude
other
men
of
their
apparel
georgiana
shot
him
a
look
no
men
merely
envy
other
men
their
acres
their
horses
their
motors
and
their
books
own
up
now
father
davy
have
you
never
coveted
any
man
library
the
eyes
sent
her
back
a
humorous
glance
now
you
have
me
he
owned
but
tell
me
daughter
it
was
not
only
their
clothes
which
stirred
the
fiend
within
you
confess
she
looked
round
at
him
i
do
need
to
she
said
you
know
the
whole
of
it
what
i
want
for
you
and
me
what
they
have
and
lots
of
it
you
need
it
just
as
badly
as
i
do
you
a
suffering
saint
at
when
other
men
are
playing
golf
and
i
simply
bursting
with
longing
to
take
you
and
go
somewhere
anywhere
with
you
and
see
things
and
do
things
and
things
and
we
as
poor
as
poverty
after
all
you
done
for
the
lord
oh
i
she
brought
her
strong
young
fist
down
on
the
nearly
threadbare
rug
with
a
thump
that
reddened
the
fine
flesh
and
thumped
again
and
yet
again
while
her
father
lay
and
silently
watched
her
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
less
of
pain
than
of
utter
comprehension
he
said
not
a
word
while
she
bit
her
lip
and
stared
again
into
the
fire
clenching
the
fist
that
had
spoken
for
her
bitterly
aching
heart
after
a
time
the
tense
fingers
relaxed
and
she
held
up
the
hand
and
looked
at
it
i
a
brute
she
said
presently
an
abominable
little
brute
how
do
you
stand
me
how
do
you
me
father
davy
i
just
bind
the
load
on
your
poor
back
and
pull
the
knots
tight
every
time
i
let
myself
break
out
like
this
if
you
were
any
but
yourself
either
preach
or
pray
at
me
how
can
you
keep
from
it
he
smiled
i
never
liked
to
be
preached
or
prayed
at
myself
dear
he
said
i
have
not
forgotten
and
the
lord
himself
does
expect
a
young
caged
lioness
to
act
like
a
caged
canary
he
does
want
it
to
and
some
day
he
will
let
it
out
of
the
cage
she
shook
her
head
and
got
up
she
kissed
the
gray
curls
and
patted
the
thin
cheek
said
cheerfully
i
going
to
get
your
supper
now
and
went
away
out
of
the
room
in
the
square
old
kitchen
she
flung
open
an
outer
door
and
stood
staring
up
at
the
starry
winter
sky
oh
if
anything
anything
would
happen
she
breathed
stretching
out
both
arms
toward
the
snowy
expanse
behind
the
house
which
in
summer
was
her
garden
if
something
would
just
keep
this
evening
from
being
like
all
the
other
evenings
i
sit
and
read
aloud
i
ca
i
and
the
only
interesting
thing
on
earth
that
can
happen
is
that
jimps
stuart
may
come
over
and
he
probably
wo
because
he
was
over
last
evening
and
the
evening
before
that
and
he
knows
he
ca
be
allowed
to
come
all
the
time
he
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
old
brass
knocker
on
the
front
door
sounded
and
something
happened
chapter
ii
something
really
happens
it
might
have
been
any
of
the
village
people
as
georgiana
expected
it
would
be
when
she
closed
the
kitchen
door
with
a
bang
and
went
reluctantly
to
answer
the
knock
since
it
was
almost
suppertime
it
was
probably
shear
who
seldom
made
a
call
at
any
other
hour
knowing
she
would
as
surely
be
asked
to
stay
as
it
was
sure
that
david
heart
would
respond
to
the
wanness
and
unhappiness
always
written
on
shear
homely
face
as
she
went
to
the
door
georgiana
felt
an
intensely
wicked
desire
to
hit
shear
a
blow
with
her
own
capable
fist
which
should
send
her
backward
into
the
snow
georgiana
did
not
believe
that
the
lady
was
as
unhappy
as
she
looked
it
seemed
to
be
a
day
for
expression
by
the
use
of
fists
but
when
the
door
was
opened
and
the
light
from
the
bracket
lamp
in
the
manse
hall
shone
out
on
the
figure
standing
upon
the
porch
all
desire
to
hit
anything
more
with
her
fist
vanished
from
the
girl
heart
for
with
the
first
look
into
the
face
of
the
man
outside
her
instant
wish
was
to
have
him
come
in
and
stay
somebody
so
evidently
from
the
great
world
which
seemed
so
far
away
from
the
old
village
manse
somebody
who
looked
as
if
he
could
bring
with
him
into
this
dull
life
of
theirs
all
manner
of
interest
it
was
small
wonder
that
in
her
present
mood
the
girl
should
feel
like
this
and
it
must
by
no
means
be
supposed
that
georgiana
was
in
the
habit
of
experiencing
this
sort
of
wish
every
time
she
set
eyes
upon
a
personable
man
personable
men
had
been
many
in
her
acquaintance
during
the
four
years
of
her
college
life
and
more
than
one
of
them
had
followed
her
back
to
the
old
manse
to
urge
his
claim
upon
her
attention
is
the
reverend
warne
at
home
asked
the
stranger
in
a
low
and
pleasant
voice
i
have
a
letter
of
introduction
to
him
please
come
in
answered
georgiana
and
led
him
straight
into
the
and
her
father
presence
then
though
consumed
with
curiosity
she
retired
as
far
as
the
door
of
the
where
she
remained
ready
to
listen
in
a
most
reprehensible
manner
to
the
conversation
which
should
follow
there
was
an
exchange
of
greetings
then
evidently
warne
was
reading
the
letter
of
introduction
presently
he
spoke
this
is
quite
sufficient
he
said
to
make
you
welcome
under
this
roof
my
old
friend
davidson
has
my
affection
and
confidence
always
please
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
mr
jefferson
i
should
like
replied
the
stranger
voice
to
have
a
room
with
you
and
possibly
board
if
that
might
be
if
not
perhaps
i
could
find
that
elsewhere
but
if
i
might
at
least
have
the
room
i
should
be
very
glad
i
am
hard
at
work
upon
a
book
and
i
have
come
away
from
my
home
and
other
work
to
find
a
place
where
i
can
live
quietly
write
steadily
and
be
outdoors
every
day
for
long
walks
in
the
country
doctor
davidson
suggested
this
place
and
thought
you
might
take
me
in
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
possibly
some
months
that
sounds
very
pleasant
to
me
georgiana
heard
her
father
reply
we
have
never
had
a
boarder
my
daughter
and
i
but
if
she
has
no
objection
i
should
enjoy
having
such
a
man
as
you
look
to
be
in
the
house
your
letter
you
see
is
not
your
only
introduction
you
carry
with
you
in
your
face
a
passport
to
other
men
favour
that
is
good
of
you
answered
jefferson
and
georgiana
liked
the
frank
tone
of
his
voice
it
was
an
educated
voice
it
spoke
for
itself
of
the
personality
behind
it
i
will
go
and
talk
with
my
daughter
she
heard
her
father
say
after
the
two
men
had
had
some
little
conversation
concerning
a
book
or
two
lying
on
the
table
by
warne
couch
georgiana
fled
into
the
kitchen
where
her
father
found
her
when
he
appeared
closing
the
door
behind
him
she
was
ready
for
him
before
he
spoke
if
he
were
the
angel
gabriel
or
old
pluto
himself
i
welcome
him
she
said
under
her
breath
her
eyes
dancing
to
have
somebody
in
the
house
for
you
to
talk
with
besides
your
everlasting
old
parishioners
why
it
would
be
worth
a
world
of
trouble
and
it
wo
be
any
trouble
at
all
go
tell
him
your
daughter
reluctantly
consents
you
heard
then
queried
warne
a
quizzical
smile
on
his
gentle
lips
of
course
i
heard
i
was
listening
hard
i
was
all
ears
regular
donkey
ears
he
a
godsend
his
board
will
pay
for
sirloin
instead
of
round
we
have
roast
duck
on
sunday
twice
a
winter
he
can
have
the
big
front
room
i
have
it
ready
by
night
come
in
and
arrange
details
urged
warne
georgiana
stayed
behind
a
minute
to
compose
her
face
and
manner
then
went
in
the
demurest
of
young
housewives
not
for
nothing
had
been
her
years
of
college
life
which
had
made
when
occasion
demanded
a
quietly
poised
woman
out
of
a
girl
who
had
been
according
to
village
standards
a
somewhat
hoydenish
young
person
as
she
faced
the
stranger
in
the
full
light
of
the
room
she
saw
in
detail
that
of
which
she
had
had
a
swift
earlier
impression
jefferson
was
a
man
in
she
thought
the
early
thirties
with
a
strongly
modelled
shaven
face
keen
brown
eyes
behind
eyeglasses
a
mouth
which
could
be
grave
one
moment
and
humorous
the
next
and
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
accustomed
to
think
for
himself
and
expect
others
to
do
so
he
was
well
built
though
not
tall
well
dressed
though
not
dapper
and
he
looked
less
like
a
writer
of
books
than
a
participant
in
action
of
some
kind
or
other
his
dark
hair
showed
a
thread
or
two
of
gray
at
the
temples
but
this
suggestion
of
age
did
not
seem
at
all
to
age
him
the
stranger
on
his
part
saw
a
rather
more
than
commonly
charming
georgiana
on
account
of
the
silk
frock
it
not
fair
to
him
thought
georgiana
to
show
him
a
landlady
who
looks
so
festive
and
fine
i
ca
afford
to
wear
this
often
even
for
his
benefit
but
to
him
she
said
i
know
it
will
give
my
father
much
pleasure
to
have
some
one
in
the
house
besides
his
daughter
and
i
am
quite
willing
to
have
you
at
our
table
i
must
warn
you
that
we
live
very
simply
as
you
must
guess
i
live
very
simply
myself
jefferson
assured
her
there
are
few
things
i
do
not
like
my
one
serious
antipathy
is
brussels
sprouts
he
added
smiling
with
that
confession
the
coast
is
clear
and
you
would
not
mind
my
smoking
in
my
room
georgiana
glanced
at
her
father
with
a
suddenly
mischievous
expression
he
was
studying
the
prospective
boarder
with
interested
eyes
i
think
confessed
warne
that
merely
to
catch
a
whiff
now
and
then
of
a
fragrance
which
is
singularly
pleasant
to
me
but
which
i
am
denied
producing
for
myself
would
add
to
the
things
that
give
me
comfort
if
you
would
mind
smoking
in
the
hall
now
and
then
or
better
yet
by
my
fireside
i
should
be
grateful
jefferson
nodded
thank
you
sir
and
now
when
may
i
come
i
have
a
room
at
the
hotel
so
do
let
me
in
until
you
are
quite
ready
you
may
come
night
for
supper
promised
georgiana
but
you
have
seen
the
room
she
rose
it
will
be
in
the
upper
right
front
hazarded
jefferson
and
it
will
have
the
customary
furnishings
and
some
means
of
heating
i
should
prefer
to
have
you
see
it
she
insisted
and
lighted
a
candle
in
an
ancient
pewter
candlestick
with
an
extinguisher
at
the
side
so
the
stranger
following
her
upstairs
surveyed
his
room
and
professed
himself
entirely
satisfied
it
looked
bare
enough
to
georgiana
as
she
showed
it
to
him
but
she
told
herself
that
there
were
possibilities
in
the
matter
of
certain
belongings
of
her
own
room
which
could
be
transferred
to
give
an
air
of
homelikeness
to
this
it
is
large
and
i
can
have
plenty
of
light
and
air
commented
the
prospective
boarder
if
i
might
have
some
sort
of
table
by
that
south
window
for
my
work
i
should
consider
myself
provided
for
you
will
find
one
when
you
come
promised
the
girl
thank
you
now
i
will
take
myself
off
at
once
then
you
may
have
a
chance
to
discuss
with
your
father
the
probabilities
in
favour
of
your
not
regretting
your
quick
decision
he
said
as
he
descended
the
stairs
father
and
i
always
make
quick
decisions
georgiana
remarked
good
so
do
i
do
you
hold
to
them
as
well
always
that
part
of
father
creed
that
very
good
that
speaks
for
itself
well
i
promise
you
i
shall
be
busy
enough
not
to
bother
this
household
overmuch
by
the
way
he
turned
suddenly
that
table
you
spoke
of
putting
in
my
room
if
it
is
large
it
must
be
heavy
your
father
can
not
help
you
lift
it
and
you
should
not
lift
it
alone
do
put
it
in
place
until
i
come
please
she
smiled
that
very
thoughtful
of
you
but
i
am
quite
equal
to
moving
it
alone
then
let
me
help
you
now
wo
you
he
offered
she
shook
her
head
it
really
not
ready
to
be
moved
do
think
of
it
again
please
he
bade
them
and
went
away
with
no
lingering
speeches
on
the
road
to
the
door
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
accustomed
to
measure
his
time
and
to
waste
none
of
it
when
he
had
gone
georgiana
went
back
to
her
father
he
looked
up
at
her
with
a
twinkle
in
his
still
boyish
eyes
well
daughter
it
looks
to
me
as
if
this
had
happened
just
in
time
to
prevent
a
bad
explosion
from
too
high
pressure
of
accumulated
energy
you
can
now
lower
the
position
of
the
indicator
on
the
steam
gauge
to
the
safety
point
by
spending
the
whole
day
in
sweeping
and
dusting
and
baking
if
there
are
any
spare
moments
you
can
employ
them
in
making
over
your
clothes
father
davy
where
did
you
get
such
a
perfectly
uncanny
understanding
from
observation
purely
from
observation
and
i
myself
confess
to
feeling
considerably
excited
and
elated
it
is
not
every
day
that
a
gentleman
of
this
sort
knocks
at
the
door
of
a
village
manse
and
asks
to
come
in
and
write
a
book
if
it
had
not
been
that
my
old
friend
davidson
is
always
bringing
people
together
who
need
each
other
i
should
think
it
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
that
this
should
happen
davidson
is
the
minister
of
a
great
new
york
church
where
this
jefferson
attends
and
davidson
has
never
forgotten
me
though
he
took
the
high
road
and
i
the
low
so
soon
after
he
left
the
seminary
well
it
will
give
us
a
fresh
interest
my
dear
for
as
long
as
it
lasts
georgiana
thought
it
would
she
was
up
betimes
next
morning
to
begin
the
sweeping
and
dusting
and
general
turning
upside
down
of
the
upper
front
room
in
the
course
of
her
window
washing
her
shoulders
enveloped
in
an
old
red
shawl
she
was
vigorously
hailed
from
below
ship
ahoy
your
name
cargo
and
destination
without
turning
she
called
merrily
back
the
jefferson
with
a
cargo
of
books
bound
for
the
public
what
that
i
do
get
you
never
mind
i
too
busy
to
be
spoken
by
every
passing
ship
i
be
up
called
the
voice
and
footsteps
sounded
upon
the
porch
the
front
door
banged
the
same
ringing
male
voice
was
heard
shouting
a
sir
and
the
owner
of
the
voice
came
leaping
up
the
stairs
and
burst
into
the
room
without
ceremony
he
advanced
till
he
was
close
to
the
open
window
and
nodded
through
the
glass
at
the
who
sat
on
the
sill
with
her
upper
body
outside
he
was
a
fine
specimen
of
youth
and
brawn
and
energy
the
young
man
whom
georgiana
had
pointed
out
to
her
friends
as
one
of
her
resources
when
it
came
to
the
good
times
they
were
so
anxious
to
know
of
his
name
was
james
stuart
and
he
was
a
near
neighbour
of
the
manse
he
was
a
college
graduate
of
three
years
longer
standing
than
georgiana
and
he
like
her
had
returned
to
the
country
home
and
his
father
farm
because
his
aging
parents
could
not
spare
him
and
he
was
the
only
son
whose
lack
of
other
ties
left
him
free
to
care
for
them
he
and
this
girl
had
been
schoolmates
and
friends
with
interesting
intervals
of
enmity
during
the
earlier
years
and
were
now
sworn
comrades
though
they
still
quarrelled
at
times
it
looked
after
a
minute
as
if
this
would
be
one
of
those
times
i
did
just
get
you
complained
james
stuart
through
the
window
wait
till
i
come
in
i
ca
tell
all
the
neighbours
georgiana
polished
off
her
last
pane
pushed
up
the
window
and
slipped
into
the
room
quite
unnecessarily
assisted
by
stuart
i
ca
understand
began
the
young
man
eying
with
approval
her
blooming
face
and
smooth
in
texture
as
the
petals
of
a
rose
why
you
washing
the
windows
of
a
room
that
always
shut
up
jimps
if
you
were
perkins
next
door
i
understand
your
consuming
curiosity
as
it
is
going
to
have
company
she
shook
her
head
then
what
in
thunder
we
going
to
have
a
boarder
if
you
must
know
georgiana
began
to
attack
the
inside
of
the
window
a
boarder
what
sort
a
very
good
sort
he
a
literary
person
with
a
book
to
write
suffering
cats
not
the
man
at
the
hotel
i
believe
he
was
to
exist
at
the
hotel
if
he
could
for
hours
admitted
georgiana
but
that
man
objected
james
stuart
is
a
why
he
he
look
like
that
sort
at
all
what
sort
if
you
please
the
literary
he
looks
like
a
well
i
took
him
for
a
professional
man
of
some
kind
georgiana
laughed
derisively
jimps
is
authorship
a
profession
well
i
mean
you
know
he
does
look
like
an
he
looks
like
some
sort
of
a
doer
he
has
that
dreamy
expression
he
sees
with
both
eyes
at
once
in
other
words
he
seems
to
be
all
there
your
idea
of
literary
men
is
a
disgrace
to
your
education
jimps
think
of
the
and
and
of
the
united
states
she
ended
triumphantly
it
does
matter
admitted
stuart
the
thing
that
does
is
that
coming
here
i
ca
say
that
appeals
to
me
how
in
time
did
he
come
to
apply
georgiana
told
him
briefly
stuart
looked
gloomy
that
all
right
he
said
as
long
as
he
confines
himself
to
being
company
for
your
father
but
if
he
takes
to
being
company
for
you
lookout
absurd
he
years
older
than
i
and
he
said
he
would
be
working
very
hard
i
shall
see
nothing
of
him
except
at
the
table
heavens
grudge
us
anything
that
promises
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
our
lives
even
a
little
bit
stuart
whistled
monotony
eh
in
spite
of
all
my
visits
all
right
but
i
be
just
as
well
pleased
if
he
wore
skirts
and
mind
you
your
uncle
jimps
is
coming
over
evenings
just
as
often
as
and
a
little
oftener
than
if
you
did
have
this
literary
light
burning
on
your
hearthstone
see
he
went
away
his
thick
fair
hair
uncapped
shining
in
the
morning
sunlight
his
arm
waving
a
friendly
farewell
back
at
the
window
where
a
white
cloth
flapped
in
reply
dear
old
boy
thought
the
young
woman
affectionately
what
should
i
do
without
him
that
afternoon
just
before
the
supper
hour
the
boarder
trunk
arrived
it
was
borne
upstairs
by
the
village
baggageman
complaining
bitterly
of
its
weight
it
was
an
trunk
and
it
bore
labels
which
indicated
that
it
was
a
traveled
trunk
shortly
afterward
the
boarder
himself
appeared
and
was
allowed
to
betake
himself
at
once
to
his
room
from
which
he
emerged
at
the
call
of
the
bell
and
came
promptly
down
meeting
warne
limping
slowly
through
the
hall
he
offered
his
arm
and
in
the
placed
his
host
in
his
chair
with
the
gentle
deference
so
welcome
from
a
younger
man
to
an
older
georgiana
as
she
served
one
of
the
undeniably
simple
but
toothsome
meals
for
the
cooking
of
which
she
was
equipped
by
many
apprenticeship
noted
how
bright
grew
father
davy
face
as
the
supper
progressed
and
how
delightfully
the
newcomer
talked
and
listened
for
if
he
was
an
interesting
talker
he
proved
to
be
a
still
more
accomplished
listener
when
the
supper
was
over
jefferson
lingered
a
few
minutes
by
the
fire
then
went
up
to
his
room
explaining
that
he
must
unpack
his
books
and
make
ready
for
an
early
attack
in
the
morning
upon
his
work
in
her
own
room
that
night
georgiana
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
just
before
she
went
to
sleep
she
addressed
herself
sternly
my
child
i
should
wonder
if
you
jumped
out
of
the
frying
pan
of
monotony
into
the
fire
of
unrest
it
certainly
means
trouble
for
you
when
you
ca
get
a
perfect
stranger
face
out
of
your
mind
for
an
hour
now
there
just
one
thing
about
it
you
always
despised
girls
who
let
themselves
leap
into
liking
any
man
and
are
so
upset
by
it
that
everybody
sees
it
this
one
is
undoubtedly
either
married
or
engaged
to
be
and
even
if
he
the
freest
old
bachelor
alive
you
are
to
behave
as
if
he
were
the
tightest
tied
you
are
to
go
straight
ahead
with
your
work
and
to
remember
every
minute
that
you
are
a
poor
daughter
with
only
a
college
training
for
an
asset
he
very
clearly
a
man
of
importance
somewhere
he
could
look
like
that
and
be
anything
else
he
will
never
think
twice
of
you
whatever
attention
he
gives
you
will
be
purely
because
he
is
a
gentleman
and
he
ca
ignore
his
daughter
nonsense
his
landlady
i
might
as
well
face
it
he
a
boarder
and
i
his
landlady
gentlemen
do
take
much
interest
in
landladies
so
now
georgiana
warne
landlady
keeper
of
a
be
sensible
and
go
to
sleep
but
before
she
went
to
sleep
her
mind
in
spite
of
her
had
imaged
for
her
again
the
interesting
face
of
the
stranger
under
the
roof
with
his
clear
straightforward
glance
that
seemed
to
see
so
much
his
smile
which
disclosed
splendid
teeth
his
strongly
moulded
chin
and
she
had
owned
frankly
driven
to
the
confession
just
to
see
if
it
would
relieve
her
it
just
such
a
face
as
i
seen
and
liked
in
crowds
sometimes
but
i
never
knew
the
owner
of
one
it
such
a
face
as
a
woman
would
remember
to
her
grave
if
its
owner
had
just
belonged
to
her
one
hour
oh
dear
god
i
prayed
you
to
let
something
happen
anything
and
now
i
afraid
but
in
the
morning
when
pulses
beat
strongly
and
courage
is
bright
georgiana
had
another
tone
to
take
with
herself
she
faced
her
image
in
the
glass
which
looked
straight
back
at
her
with
unflinching
dark
eyes
i
ashamed
of
you
to
moon
and
croon
like
that
now
brace
up
miss
warne
and
be
yourself
you
never
lacked
spirit
you
not
going
to
lack
it
now
you
going
to
be
strong
and
sane
about
this
thing
going
to
be
the
sort
of
girl
whose
mind
no
man
can
guess
at
going
to
weave
rugs
for
your
life
and
enjoy
jimps
stuart
as
you
always
have
and
there
not
going
to
be
a
whimper
out
of
you
from
this
hour
no
matter
what
happens
or
does
happen
do
you
hear
well
then
attention
head
up
shoulders
back
heart
steady
forward
two
hours
later
when
in
the
absence
of
the
new
inmate
georgiana
went
into
his
room
to
put
it
in
order
for
the
day
she
found
it
impossible
not
to
note
the
character
of
his
belongings
they
were
few
and
simple
enough
but
in
every
detail
they
betrayed
a
fastidious
taste
and
among
the
articles
in
ebony
and
leather
which
lay
upon
the
linen
cover
of
the
old
bureau
stood
one
which
held
her
fascinated
attention
it
was
a
framed
photograph
of
a
young
and
very
lovely
woman
in
evening
dress
and
the
face
which
smiled
over
the
perfect
shoulder
was
looking
straight
out
at
her
georgiana
stared
back
who
are
you
she
whispered
i
might
have
known
you
would
be
here
and
who
please
are
you
the
picture
seemed
to
query
lightly
smiling
in
return
for
the
other
frown
as
for
me
do
you
see
plainly
i
belong
to
him
else
why
should
he
have
me
here
you
see
i
the
only
one
he
cared
to
bring
does
that
speak
for
itself
of
course
it
does
agreed
georgiana
then
stoutly
and
why
should
i
care
of
course
i
do
care
to
care
would
be
absurd
chapter
iii
a
occurrence
father
davy
the
has
come
georgiana
tugging
with
both
strong
young
arms
hauled
the
big
express
package
into
the
of
the
old
manse
and
shut
the
door
with
a
bang
breathing
rapidly
from
her
exertions
her
cheeks
warmly
flushed
her
dark
eyes
glowing
she
stood
over
the
package
looking
at
her
father
with
a
curious
sort
of
smile
not
wholly
compounded
of
joy
and
satisfaction
that
is
very
good
said
father
davy
in
his
pleasant
voice
and
very
opportune
it
was
but
yesterday
it
seems
to
me
that
i
heard
daughter
declaring
that
she
was
so
shabby
yes
yes
but
what
do
you
wager
there
is
there
questioned
georgiana
i
can
tell
you
before
i
take
the
cover
off
three
evening
gowns
frivolous
and
impossible
for
a
little
town
like
this
one
draggled
lingerie
frock
two
evening
coats
and
possibly
just
possibly
a
last
year
tailored
suit
with
a
tear
in
the
front
of
the
skirt
and
not
a
scrap
of
goods
to
make
a
fold
to
cover
it
why
oh
why
do
they
never
have
any
pieces
the
reason
seems
obvious
enough
warne
suggested
as
the
girl
stooped
and
began
to
wrestle
with
the
cords
which
tied
the
big
package
his
glance
fell
musingly
on
the
head
with
its
masses
of
hair
upon
the
white
and
shapely
arms
from
which
the
sleeves
were
rolled
back
georgiana
had
been
busy
in
the
kitchen
when
the
expressman
came
upon
the
whole
comely
young
figure
in
its
morning
dress
they
never
have
need
of
the
pieces
i
should
judge
said
he
but
i
have
jeannette
might
think
of
me
when
she
orders
her
clothes
not
just
when
her
maid
is
packing
the
box
with
a
lot
of
castaways
well
here
hoping
there
just
one
thing
i
can
use
and
she
lifted
the
cover
of
the
box
and
looked
within
it
can
not
be
denied
with
eager
curiosity
there
are
always
many
things
you
can
use
her
father
gently
reminded
her
you
who
are
so
ingenious
here
the
evening
frock
cried
his
daughter
lifting
out
the
top
garment
and
holding
it
up
before
them
both
oh
what
a
dress
to
send
a
poor
country
cousin
fluff
and
flimsy
trimmed
with
sparklers
cut
frightfully
low
no
sleeves
and
a
draggly
train
does
it
look
suitable
for
me
she
flung
it
aside
with
a
gesture
of
scorn
ah
here
something
a
shade
better
a
little
dancing
frock
of
chiffon
and
her
clumsy
partner
stepped
on
the
hem
of
it
the
maid
in
the
sewed
it
up
for
her
to
have
her
last
dance
in
and
then
she
came
home
and
threw
it
into
the
box
for
me
well
i
can
get
a
gorgeous
motor
veil
out
of
it
i
who
have
so
many
drives
in
the
cars
of
the
rich
the
the
under
part
looks
available
to
me
suggested
warne
striving
to
be
of
comfort
georgiana
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
yes
if
i
could
dress
in
slitted
silk
petticoats
and
you
could
wear
them
for
we
have
plenty
well
look
at
here
a
velvet
cerise
what
a
glorious
impossible
colour
and
here
the
lingerie
frock
that
not
so
bad
i
really
think
it
will
stand
a
couple
of
launderings
before
it
falls
to
pieces
in
my
hands
and
here
the
evening
coat
pale
gray
with
fox
trimmings
and
she
fallen
foul
of
some
ink
or
something
and
the
cleaner
could
get
it
all
out
father
davy
look
it
seems
to
me
said
warne
in
his
gentle
tones
which
were
yet
not
without
more
firmness
than
one
might
expect
from
so
frail
a
person
that
i
have
heard
somewhere
a
homely
proverb
to
the
effect
that
it
is
not
quite
in
good
taste
to
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth
finished
georgiana
her
eyes
were
rebellious
and
there
another
must
be
yes
i
know
only
i
certainly
do
experience
a
burning
wish
that
my
dear
rich
relations
were
persons
with
a
trifle
keener
sense
of
discernment
as
to
which
of
their
old
clothes
would
be
most
appreciated
by
their
poor
cousins
they
must
now
and
then
father
davy
wear
something
sensible
they
must
have
morning
clothes
and
street
clothes
adorable
ones
why
do
they
send
only
the
worldly
clothes
to
the
manse
and
why
do
they
never
put
in
so
much
as
one
of
uncle
thomas
discarded
cravats
for
the
little
minister
himself
your
uncle
thomas
and
i
may
possibly
have
different
tastes
in
the
matter
of
neckwear
replied
warne
with
such
gravity
of
manner
but
such
a
sparkle
of
humour
in
his
eyes
that
his
daughter
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
come
come
dear
is
there
nothing
you
can
approve
among
all
those
rich
materials
you
might
make
me
innumerable
cravats
and
i
am
such
a
fop
i
could
wear
a
fresh
one
each
day
to
please
you
father
davy
georgiana
sat
back
on
her
heels
she
had
slipped
her
bared
arms
into
the
armholes
of
the
sleeveless
white
evening
frock
and
the
sparklers
of
the
bodice
now
framed
her
clad
shoulders
with
an
astonishing
effect
of
incongruity
i
have
a
wonderful
inspiration
let
ask
jeannette
out
here
for
a
visit
an
as
to
the
state
of
life
whereunto
the
country
cousins
have
been
called
she
has
seen
me
in
ten
years
and
all
i
remember
of
her
is
a
fluffy
girl
with
a
sniffly
cold
in
her
head
what
do
you
say
father
davy
shall
we
ask
her
her
father
gaze
quiet
comprehending
more
than
a
little
amused
met
georgiana
audacious
defiant
mischievous
yet
reasonable
the
two
looked
at
each
other
for
a
full
minute
do
you
think
she
would
come
warne
inquired
doubtfully
why
should
she
come
she
had
a
gay
winter
so
far
but
not
a
happy
one
she
no
debutante
any
more
you
know
she
an
girl
in
her
fifth
season
that
what
the
society
girls
get
by
coming
out
at
eighteen
now
i
who
am
only
a
year
out
of
college
and
who
never
out
in
my
life
am
as
keen
at
the
game
of
being
grown
up
as
if
i
were
just
putting
up
my
hair
for
the
first
time
well
jeannette
been
keeping
up
the
pace
all
winter
is
thoroughly
worn
out
and
unhappy
and
does
know
what
to
do
with
herself
it
march
and
lent
the
time
of
year
when
the
society
folks
betake
themselves
to
spring
resorts
to
recover
their
shattered
nerves
do
you
think
she
jump
at
the
chance
to
come
to
the
little
country
town
and
try
what
our
air
and
our
cookery
would
do
for
her
you
seem
to
know
all
about
her
in
spite
of
not
having
seen
or
known
her
except
through
these
boxes
of
clothes
since
she
was
a
little
girl
ah
that
just
it
through
her
boxes
that
how
i
know
her
triumphantly
georgiana
held
up
the
cerise
velvet
gown
do
i
know
a
girl
who
would
wear
that
wild
for
excitement
that
why
she
chose
the
colour
but
she
did
get
the
fun
she
expected
he
did
like
it
or
somebody
said
she
looked
too
pale
in
it
and
she
fired
it
at
me
before
she
had
done
more
than
take
the
freshness
off
can
wear
it
see
here
she
got
to
her
feet
untied
the
little
black
silk
tie
which
held
the
collar
of
her
working
dress
at
the
throat
unfastened
a
row
of
hooks
and
let
the
blue
print
slip
to
her
feet
over
the
glory
of
her
white
shoulders
and
gleaming
arms
she
flung
the
cerise
velvet
gorgeous
glowing
wonderful
colour
as
trying
to
the
ordinary
complexion
as
colour
can
well
be
but
as
the
gown
fell
into
place
and
georgiana
backing
up
to
her
father
was
fastened
somewhat
tentatively
into
it
it
would
have
been
plain
to
any
beholder
that
if
the
rich
girl
could
not
wear
the
queenly
daring
robe
the
poor
girl
could
as
she
had
said
she
swept
up
and
down
the
room
her
head
held
high
she
played
the
part
of
a
lady
of
fashion
and
held
an
imaginary
reception
carrying
on
a
stream
of
society
talk
with
a
manner
which
made
the
pale
man
on
the
couch
laugh
like
a
boy
holding
a
dialogue
with
a
hypothetical
male
guest
she
led
him
out
into
the
hall
still
within
sight
of
couch
and
was
in
the
midst
of
a
scene
as
inspiredly
clever
as
anything
she
had
ever
done
at
college
where
she
had
been
the
pride
of
a
dramatic
club
whose
fame
had
waxed
greater
than
that
of
any
similar
organization
for
many
years
when
the
front
door
of
the
house
suddenly
opened
and
a
gust
of
chilly
march
air
rushed
in
with
the
person
entering
georgiana
wheeled
to
find
herself
confronting
the
amused
gaze
of
her
boarder
jefferson
as
read
the
address
upon
his
mail
jefferson
was
by
this
time
after
a
month
under
the
roof
of
the
old
manse
well
established
as
a
member
of
the
household
though
after
the
somewhat
remote
fashion
to
be
expected
of
a
man
whose
absorbing
work
filled
most
of
his
waking
hours
he
closed
the
door
quickly
as
he
caught
sight
of
georgiana
in
her
masquerade
removed
his
hat
and
bent
his
head
before
the
cerise
velvet
georgiana
blushing
as
vividly
as
if
it
were
the
first
time
mortal
man
had
ever
beheld
her
pretty
shoulders
threw
him
a
laughing
look
murmured
dress
parade
in
borrowed
finery
jefferson
do
let
the
blaze
of
colour
put
your
eyes
out
and
retreated
toward
the
where
her
father
sat
much
amused
by
the
situation
she
was
followed
by
her
boarder
reply
i
find
myself
still
happily
retaining
the
use
of
my
eyes
miss
warne
you
need
not
be
too
much
in
haste
it
is
very
dull
outside
i
assure
you
he
went
on
up
the
stairs
but
she
had
caught
his
smile
momentarily
illumining
a
face
which
was
ordinarily
rather
grave
georgiana
closed
the
door
upon
the
sight
of
the
lithe
figure
rapidly
ascending
the
staircase
without
a
glance
behind
as
she
faced
her
father
she
assumed
the
expression
of
a
merry
child
caught
in
mischief
our
new
lodger
has
certainly
come
upon
me
in
all
sorts
of
situations
not
to
mention
disguises
she
remarked
but
this
is
the
first
time
he
has
met
me
in
the
role
of
leading
lady
on
the
melodramatic
stage
please
unhook
me
father
davy
the
play
is
over
and
it
time
to
get
the
simmering
and
what
do
you
say
to
inviting
lovely
jeannette
crofton
to
visit
us
would
it
be
too
hard
on
you
not
at
all
my
dear
i
should
be
glad
to
see
your
uncle
daughter
invite
her
by
all
means
you
have
far
too
little
young
companionship
it
will
do
you
good
to
have
a
girl
of
your
own
age
in
the
house
i
wonder
how
we
shall
get
on
mused
georgiana
anyhow
she
see
what
a
market
this
is
for
evening
frocks
cut
on
her
lines
chapter
iv
a
literary
light
many
hours
afterward
the
labours
of
the
day
over
georgiana
bent
her
dark
head
above
an
in
a
corner
of
the
and
dashed
off
the
contemplated
letter
to
her
almost
unknown
cousin
how
the
invitation
would
be
received
she
had
little
idea
but
since
a
letter
of
thanks
was
undeniably
due
in
response
to
the
box
it
was
certainly
a
simple
and
natural
matter
enough
to
offer
in
return
for
it
a
possible
pleasure
and
a
certain
benefit
i
run
straight
down
to
the
and
mail
it
declared
georgiana
sealing
and
stamping
her
letter
after
having
read
it
aloud
to
her
father
a
run
in
this
march
wind
will
be
good
for
me
after
baking
and
brewing
all
day
do
daughter
and
take
a
tumbler
or
two
of
jelly
to
ames
by
the
way
and
pick
a
spray
or
two
of
the
scarlet
geranium
to
go
with
it
warne
spoke
from
the
depths
of
an
old
armchair
by
the
fire
where
with
a
lamp
at
his
elbow
he
was
not
too
deep
in
a
speech
of
the
elder
pitt
on
quartering
soldiers
in
boston
to
take
thought
for
an
invalid
whom
he
considered
far
less
fortunate
than
himself
i
will
poor
disagreeable
old
lady
she
does
admit
that
anything
tastes
as
it
should
but
i
observe
our
jelly
is
never
long
in
disappearing
georgiana
now
wearing
in
honour
of
the
close
of
day
a
simple
frock
of
wool
with
a
dash
of
scarlet
at
throat
and
wrists
donned
a
big
military
cape
of
blue
scarlet
lined
and
twisted
about
her
neck
a
scarf
of
scarlet
silk
dyed
from
a
petticoat
which
served
less
as
a
protection
than
as
the
finishing
touch
to
her
gay
winter
night
costume
she
was
likely
to
meet
few
people
on
her
way
but
there
were
always
plenty
of
loungers
in
the
small
village
and
not
even
a
college
graduate
could
be
altogether
disdainful
of
the
masculine
admiration
sure
to
be
found
there
though
she
might
ignore
it
as
she
closed
the
house
door
lifting
her
face
to
a
cold
starlit
sky
from
which
the
clouds
of
the
day
had
broken
away
at
sundown
another
door
a
few
rods
down
the
quiet
street
banged
loudly
and
the
sharp
creak
of
rapid
footsteps
was
immediately
to
be
heard
upon
the
frozen
gravel
georgiana
smiled
in
the
darkness
at
the
coincidence
of
that
banging
door
well
met
called
a
ringing
voice
curious
that
i
should
break
out
of
perkins
just
as
you
came
along
very
curious
jimps
how
do
you
manage
it
i
stole
out
like
a
cat
just
to
avoid
such
a
possibility
i
knew
you
were
there
did
you
indeed
inquired
the
owner
of
the
voice
coming
up
and
standing
still
to
look
at
what
he
could
see
of
the
form
his
own
strongly
built
figure
took
up
its
position
beside
hers
as
if
by
right
his
hand
slipped
lightly
under
her
arm
and
he
turned
her
gently
to
face
the
direction
in
which
he
himself
had
set
out
that
like
your
impertinence
to
pay
you
for
it
you
shall
come
this
way
he
insisted
it
only
a
step
farther
it
not
quite
so
hackneyed
and
it
will
bring
us
out
where
we
want
to
be
look
at
the
stars
they
wonderful
carrying
something
under
that
cape
give
it
to
me
chum
it
only
a
bit
of
a
basket
jimps
never
mind
you
might
spill
it
you
ca
carry
a
bit
of
a
basket
when
i
around
spill
nothing
hand
it
over
terribly
dictatorial
are
you
possibly
i
been
bossing
a
lot
of
new
hands
who
did
know
a
pick
from
a
but
you
been
outdoors
every
minute
her
tone
was
envious
every
blessed
minute
and
you
been
in
puttering
over
a
lot
of
house
jobs
see
here
you
need
a
run
let
take
the
time
to
go
up
harmon
hill
and
run
down
it
eh
there
not
be
a
soul
to
see
she
laughed
doubtfully
i
love
to
but
the
jelly
that
easy
he
dropped
her
arm
turned
aside
to
a
clump
of
trees
at
the
corner
of
an
overgrown
old
place
which
they
were
passing
and
deposited
the
little
basket
in
the
shadow
he
came
back
and
caught
her
arm
again
easy
now
up
the
hill
i
wish
the
snow
was
all
gone
we
have
a
farewell
coast
at
the
end
of
the
season
but
there
undoubtedly
be
more
honestly
now
george
has
the
coasting
and
tramping
helped
you
through
this
first
winter
jimps
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
it
or
you
thanks
i
think
so
myself
the
first
winter
back
in
the
little
old
town
after
the
years
away
at
school
and
college
well
anyhow
i
pride
myself
the
partnership
has
worked
pretty
well
we
been
about
as
good
chums
as
you
could
ask
have
we
now
about
as
good
all
right
his
tone
had
a
decided
ring
of
satisfaction
in
it
but
he
did
not
pursue
the
subject
further
instead
he
changed
it
abruptly
how
does
the
new
boarder
come
on
very
well
we
really
do
mind
having
him
at
all
he
so
quiet
and
father
enjoys
his
table
talk
father
does
but
daughter
does
oh
yes
i
do
only
he
does
talk
much
to
me
i
sit
and
listen
to
their
discussions
and
jump
up
to
wait
on
them
so
often
that
i
sometimes
lose
the
thread
the
duffer
why
does
he
get
up
and
wait
on
you
georgiana
laughed
jimps
we
going
to
have
another
guest
another
man
the
question
came
quickly
not
at
all
a
girl
my
cousin
jeannette
crofton
at
least
i
writing
to
ask
her
for
the
fortnight
before
easter
those
rich
crofton
relations
of
yours
who
hold
their
heads
so
high
for
no
particular
reason
except
that
it
helps
them
to
forget
their
feet
are
on
the
earth
james
stuart
what
have
i
ever
said
of
them
to
make
you
speak
like
that
never
mind
go
on
is
it
the
girl
whose
picture
gets
into
the
sunday
papers
entirely
against
her
will
of
course
as
the
daughter
of
thomas
crofton
she
reported
engaged
from
time
to
time
and
then
the
report
is
denied
she
i
shall
tell
you
no
more
about
her
said
georgiana
warne
with
her
head
held
quite
as
high
as
if
she
belonged
to
that
branch
of
the
family
to
whom
james
stuart
had
so
irreverently
alluded
all
right
i
not
interested
in
her
anyhow
and
you
want
your
breath
for
the
run
down
come
on
george
one
more
spurt
and
up
all
ready
take
hold
of
my
hand
come
on
in
the
march
starlight
the
two
ran
hand
in
hand
down
the
long
steep
harmon
hill
which
led
from
the
east
into
the
little
town
stuart
grip
was
tight
or
more
than
once
georgiana
would
have
slipped
on
the
rough
iciness
of
the
descent
but
she
did
not
falter
at
the
rush
of
it
and
she
was
not
panting
only
breathing
quickly
when
they
came
to
a
standstill
upon
the
level
good
lungs
those
of
yours
george
commented
stuart
in
the
frank
manner
in
which
he
might
have
said
it
to
a
younger
brother
you
played
basket
ball
and
rowed
in
your
boat
for
nothing
sure
you
not
letting
up
a
bit
on
all
that
training
now
that
you
back
baking
beans
for
boarders
and
sweeping
their
rooms
and
carrying
up
wood
for
their
fires
and
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
literary
light
allows
you
to
tote
wood
for
him
they
were
walking
on
rapidly
now
i
be
over
in
the
morning
and
take
up
a
pile
that
leave
no
room
for
him
to
put
his
feet
he
thinking
of
jimps
boy
how
absurd
you
are
how
should
he
know
who
puts
the
wood
in
his
room
i
do
go
up
with
armfuls
of
it
when
he
there
if
you
did
he
merely
open
the
door
for
you
and
say
you
very
much
my
good
girl
i
do
like
this
boarder
business
i
can
tell
you
that
do
you
let
him
smoke
in
his
room
why
not
you
unreasonable
mortal
he
smokes
a
beautiful
briarwood
and
such
delicious
tobacco
that
i
find
myself
sniffing
the
air
when
i
go
through
the
hall
in
the
evening
hoping
i
may
get
a
whiff
does
eh
when
i
bring
up
the
wood
i
smoke
up
your
hall
so
you
have
to
sniff
the
air
to
know
you
enjoying
the
fragrance
of
araby
in
this
light
and
airy
mood
the
pair
went
on
their
way
enjoying
each
other
company
as
might
any
boy
and
girl
though
each
had
left
the
irresponsible
years
behind
and
had
settled
down
to
the
sober
work
of
manhood
and
womanhood
to
georgiana
warne
whose
necessary
presence
at
home
instead
of
out
in
the
great
world
of
activity
where
she
longed
to
be
stuart
society
as
he
had
intimated
had
been
a
strong
support
during
this
first
year
and
a
half
since
her
return
the
singularly
similar
circumstances
which
had
shaped
the
plans
of
these
two
young
people
had
been
the
means
of
inspiring
much
comprehending
sympathy
between
them
an
almost
lifelong
previous
acquaintance
had
put
them
on
a
footing
of
brotherly
and
sisterly
intimacy
now
powerfully
enhanced
by
the
sense
of
need
each
felt
for
the
other
it
was
small
wonder
that
their
were
accustomed
to
couple
their
names
as
they
would
those
of
a
pair
long
betrothed
and
that
as
the
two
came
together
into
the
village
where
as
usual
a
group
of
citizens
lounged
and
lingered
on
one
pretext
or
another
the
appearance
of
jim
stuart
and
georgie
warne
should
cause
no
comment
whatever
more
than
one
idler
noted
as
often
before
the
fashion
in
which
the
two
were
outwardly
suited
to
each
other
both
were
the
possessors
of
the
superb
health
which
is
such
a
desirable
ally
to
true
vigour
of
mind
and
since
both
were
understood
to
be
in
the
village
usage
highly
educated
their
attraction
for
each
other
was
considered
a
natural
sequence
as
it
undoubtedly
was
the
mail
procured
the
letter
posted
and
the
small
basket
delivered
to
a
querulously
grateful
old
woman
the
young
people
set
out
for
home
they
had
somehow
fallen
into
a
more
serious
mood
and
walking
more
slowly
than
before
discussed
soberly
enough
certain
problems
of
stuart
connected
with
the
commercial
side
of
market
gardening
he
spoke
precisely
as
he
would
have
spoken
to
a
man
with
the
possible
difference
that
he
made
his
explanations
of
business
conditions
a
trifle
fuller
than
he
might
have
done
to
any
man
but
his
confidence
in
his
friend
ability
to
grasp
the
situation
was
shown
by
the
way
in
which
ending
his
statement
of
the
case
he
asked
her
advice
now
given
just
this
crisis
what
would
you
do
george
he
said
she
considered
in
silence
for
some
paces
then
she
asked
a
question
or
two
more
put
with
a
clearness
which
showed
that
she
understood
precisely
the
points
to
be
taken
into
consideration
he
answered
concisely
and
she
then
after
a
minute
further
communion
with
herself
suggested
what
seemed
to
her
a
feasible
course
stuart
demurred
thought
it
over
argued
the
thing
for
a
little
with
her
and
came
round
to
her
point
of
view
he
threw
back
his
head
with
a
relieved
laugh
i
admit
it
it
a
mighty
good
suggestion
it
may
be
the
way
out
anyhow
it
well
worth
trying
george
you
a
peach
there
is
one
girl
in
a
hundred
who
would
have
listened
with
intelligence
enough
to
make
her
opinion
worth
a
picayune
i
not
a
girl
jimps
i
do
want
to
be
a
girl
at
i
ca
i
have
time
that
a
safe
enough
statement
replied
james
stuart
looking
down
at
the
dark
head
beside
him
under
the
march
starlight
as
long
as
you
continue
to
act
enough
like
a
normal
girl
to
run
down
the
hills
with
me
after
dark
well
here
we
are
worse
luck
i
suppose
you
not
going
to
ask
me
in
there
was
a
touch
of
appeal
in
the
lightly
spoken
question
not
jimps
i
sorry
father
davy
overdid
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
and
i
must
see
him
to
bed
early
and
read
him
to
sleep
after
he
gone
the
literary
light
wo
come
down
and
smoke
his
mixture
by
your
fire
instead
of
his
own
while
you
entertain
him
will
he
her
low
laugh
rang
out
you
ridiculous
person
what
a
vivid
imagination
you
have
every
evening
at
about
this
time
the
literary
light
goes
off
for
a
long
tramp
by
himself
and
often
does
come
back
till
all
our
lights
are
out
except
the
one
we
leave
burning
for
him
he
is
absolutely
absorbed
in
his
work
we
really
see
nothing
at
all
of
him
except
at
the
table
just
the
same
the
time
will
come
predicted
james
stuart
some
night
he
take
his
regular
place
at
your
fireside
as
he
does
at
your
table
i
know
your
father
soft
heart
yours
may
not
be
quite
so
vulnerable
but
if
the
boarder
should
happen
to
look
low
in
his
mind
after
a
telegram
from
anywhere
or
should
get
his
precious
feet
wet
jimps
go
home
and
be
sensible
when
jeannette
comes
if
she
does
come
which
i
doubt
more
and
more
you
may
be
asked
over
quite
a
number
of
times
during
her
visit
i
presume
so
and
that
the
time
you
have
jefferson
down
and
you
pair
off
with
him
while
i
do
my
prettiest
not
to
look
like
an
awkward
countryman
before
the
lady
who
has
her
picture
in
the
sunday
papers
james
stuart
georgiana
dear
stuart
responded
cheerfully
but
the
last
word
was
under
his
breath
chapter
v
shabbiness
i
positively
did
know
how
shabby
the
house
was
till
i
read
jeannette
letter
of
acceptance
she
did
not
say
it
to
her
father
not
georgiana
warne
she
said
it
not
to
james
stuart
nor
to
jefferson
being
georgiana
she
said
it
to
no
one
but
her
slightly
daunted
self
she
was
standing
in
the
hall
as
she
spoke
the
wide
plain
hall
which
ran
straight
through
the
middle
of
the
wide
plain
house
with
its
square
rooms
on
either
side
and
its
winding
staircase
at
the
back
of
the
house
itself
georgiana
was
not
in
the
least
ashamed
she
knew
that
it
possessed
a
certain
charm
of
aspect
from
the
fanlight
over
the
entrance
door
to
the
big
quaint
kitchen
with
its
uneven
floor
dark
with
time
it
was
when
one
came
to
details
that
the
charm
sordidly
vanished
at
least
to
the
critical
vision
of
the
young
housewife
like
the
worn
white
paint
upon
its
exterior
the
walls
and
floors
within
called
loudly
for
a
restoring
hand
as
for
the
furnishings
georgiana
looked
about
her
with
an
appraising
eye
which
took
in
all
their
dinginess
the
old
rugs
and
carpets
were
so
nearly
threadbare
the
furniture
was
so
worn
the
very
muslin
curtains
at
the
windows
though
white
as
hands
could
make
them
had
been
so
many
times
repaired
that
even
artful
draping
could
not
wholly
conceal
their
deficiencies
in
other
ways
the
household
lack
of
means
made
itself
plainly
apparent
to
the
daughter
of
the
house
as
she
went
from
room
to
room
the
linen
press
for
instance
how
pitifully
low
its
piles
of
sheets
and
towels
had
grown
hardly
a
sheet
but
had
a
patch
upon
it
hardly
a
towel
but
had
been
cut
down
and
rehemmed
that
it
might
last
as
long
as
possible
there
was
to
be
sure
one
small
tier
of
towels
handed
down
from
georgiana
grandmother
and
carefully
preserved
against
much
using
of
which
any
mistress
of
a
linen
press
might
be
proud
there
were
also
two
pairs
of
fine
linen
sheets
with
borders
exquisitely
drawn
two
pairs
of
pillow
cases
to
match
and
a
quite
wonderful
old
bedspread
of
knitted
lace
i
can
keep
washing
out
the
best
towels
for
her
georgiana
reflected
resignedly
as
she
counted
her
resources
in
the
china
cupboard
there
was
left
quite
a
stock
of
rare
old
plates
and
dishes
which
could
be
used
as
occasion
demanded
the
crockery
which
must
serve
a
part
of
the
time
was
pretty
meagre
the
supply
of
antique
silver
good
as
far
as
it
went
it
did
not
go
very
far
but
after
all
said
georgiana
to
herself
determinedly
we
can
give
her
good
things
to
eat
and
served
as
attractively
as
need
be
why
should
i
mind
about
the
rest
father
in
his
armchair
is
a
benediction
to
any
meal
and
jefferson
can
talk
as
few
guests
can
who
sit
at
the
crofton
table
i
wager
i
not
be
apologetic
even
in
my
mind
no
matter
how
much
i
feel
like
it
i
asked
her
and
she
coming
she
would
be
coming
if
she
was
in
a
way
willing
to
take
what
she
finds
we
have
a
good
time
out
of
it
whereupon
she
betook
herself
to
the
room
which
was
to
be
given
to
her
cousin
and
fell
to
work
with
a
will
for
this
was
the
last
thing
to
be
done
before
the
arrival
of
the
guest
when
it
was
in
order
she
looked
about
it
not
ill
content
it
would
be
an
exacting
guest
surely
who
could
not
be
comfortable
here
and
there
are
many
of
elaborate
appointments
where
guests
are
not
wholly
comfortable
this
room
was
large
and
square
and
airy
with
its
four
windows
facing
east
and
south
and
the
view
from
the
eastern
ones
was
with
a
glimpse
of
blue
mountain
ranges
in
the
distance
if
the
matting
upon
the
floor
had
been
many
times
turned
and
refitted
its
worn
places
were
now
all
cunningly
hidden
and
it
was
as
fresh
as
the
newly
scrubbed
paint
on
the
woodwork
there
was
a
luxuriously
cushioned
chair
would
jeannette
by
any
possibility
recognize
the
blue
silk
of
those
cushion
covers
georgiana
wondered
jeannette
who
never
wore
a
frock
long
enough
really
to
become
familiar
with
its
pattern
would
only
know
that
the
cushions
were
soft
to
her
body
the
woven
rag
rugs
of
blue
and
white
upon
the
floor
were
of
georgiana
own
making
an
ancient
desk
which
had
belonged
to
warne
mother
was
carefully
fitted
with
all
the
small
articles
one
could
desire
in
reason
taken
from
cherished
college
equipment
the
washstand
in
the
corner
behind
a
screen
of
clever
design
was
furnished
with
two
beautiful
old
ewers
the
pride
of
georgiana
heart
for
they
had
come
over
from
england
with
her
great
grandmother
and
the
rack
was
hung
as
full
with
towels
as
fastidious
bather
could
desire
there
were
two
or
three
interesting
old
prints
upon
the
walls
altogether
with
its
small
bedroom
fireplace
laid
ready
for
a
fire
and
a
blue
woodbox
filled
to
overflowing
with
more
wood
she
had
forgotten
to
fill
the
woodbox
as
yet
it
was
nearly
time
to
dress
for
jeannette
coming
georgiana
ran
hurriedly
downstairs
and
through
the
kitchen
warm
and
fragrant
with
the
baking
of
the
day
in
preparation
for
the
coming
supper
and
in
that
pleasant
order
which
the
kitchen
of
the
good
housewife
shows
at
four
in
the
afternoon
in
the
woodshed
beyond
she
gathered
a
great
armful
of
wood
not
to
bother
with
the
basket
which
would
not
hold
so
much
and
hurried
back
again
making
toward
the
front
stairs
this
time
because
the
back
stairs
were
narrow
and
steep
and
one
could
not
rush
up
them
at
great
speed
with
one
arms
full
of
wood
wait
a
minute
please
miss
warne
the
front
door
of
the
house
shut
with
a
bang
and
hasty
footsteps
caught
up
with
georgiana
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
just
as
one
big
stick
tumbled
loose
from
her
hold
and
went
crashing
down
behind
her
oh
never
mind
she
panted
the
load
was
much
heavier
than
she
had
realized
but
she
had
not
meant
to
be
caught
upon
the
front
stairs
with
it
not
even
if
it
had
been
james
stuart
who
came
to
her
rescue
it
was
not
stuart
but
evidently
one
quite
of
stuart
mind
for
georgiana
now
found
her
arms
unburdened
of
their
heavy
incumbrance
without
further
parley
and
herself
put
where
she
belonged
by
this
cool
command
never
carry
a
load
like
this
when
you
have
a
man
in
the
house
but
but
we
have
objected
georgiana
her
voice
a
trifle
breathless
she
followed
jefferson
as
he
strode
up
the
stairs
with
the
wood
she
opened
the
door
of
the
and
lifted
the
cover
of
the
woodbox
have
he
questioned
dumping
the
wood
into
the
box
and
then
stooping
to
rearrange
it
would
you
object
to
telling
me
what
you
consider
me
then
it
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
tell
him
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
a
literary
light
but
she
restrained
the
speech
you
are
of
course
a
boarder
a
guest
as
we
should
say
if
we
were
some
people
she
observed
with
gravity
you
are
expected
to
complain
of
whatever
service
you
receive
not
to
offer
any
under
any
circumstances
i
see
were
you
intending
to
fill
this
box
he
stood
upright
and
his
glance
wandered
from
the
box
in
question
around
the
pleasant
room
in
its
fresh
and
expectant
order
but
it
came
discreetly
back
to
georgiana
face
not
at
all
she
denied
there
quite
enough
there
for
he
nodded
and
went
toward
the
door
the
woodshed
is
i
suppose
beyond
the
kitchen
after
the
fashion
of
woodsheds
and
the
kitchen
is
beyond
the
please
do
bother
of
course
it
was
useless
to
protest
and
she
followed
him
down
the
stairs
through
and
kitchen
to
the
woodshed
as
he
passed
through
the
kitchen
he
stopped
and
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
it
may
i
look
for
a
minute
he
asked
it
takes
me
back
to
my
boyhood
my
mother
used
just
such
a
kitchen
as
this
i
thought
it
the
best
room
in
the
house
his
lips
took
on
a
smile
as
he
looked
georgiana
with
her
own
hands
had
scoured
every
inch
of
that
kitchen
had
made
to
shine
brilliantly
every
utensil
which
had
in
it
possibilities
of
shining
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
a
housewifely
pride
in
the
appearance
of
the
place
and
to
exult
in
the
spicy
odours
which
told
of
the
bakings
jefferson
going
on
into
the
woodshed
and
returning
with
a
load
of
wood
which
put
georgiana
late
attempt
to
the
blush
assured
her
that
he
felt
personally
competent
to
attend
to
the
woodbox
without
further
aid
from
her
and
marched
away
as
if
he
were
quite
accustomed
to
such
tasks
it
may
be
here
stated
that
next
day
when
in
his
absence
she
looked
into
his
room
to
see
if
the
woodbox
there
were
quite
empty
she
found
it
quite
full
though
she
could
not
possibly
remember
when
he
had
discovered
the
opportunity
to
do
the
deed
without
her
knowledge
and
from
this
time
forth
during
the
remainder
of
his
stay
she
was
obliged
to
resign
herself
to
the
fact
that
the
man
in
the
house
though
he
might
be
a
boarder
would
permit
no
interference
with
this
task
jeannette
had
written
that
she
would
arrive
on
a
certain
thursday
afternoon
between
four
and
five
being
conveyed
by
motor
from
the
large
city
sixty
miles
away
which
was
her
home
georgiana
therefore
with
memories
of
college
days
again
strong
upon
her
made
ready
to
serve
afternoon
tea
beside
the
fire
be
prepared
to
have
this
function
every
day
while
the
guest
is
here
father
davy
said
she
jeannette
undoubtedly
accustomed
to
it
and
would
miss
it
more
than
she
could
miss
any
other
one
thing
but
she
to
have
only
the
plainest
of
thin
bread
and
butter
with
it
since
our
village
supper
comes
so
soon
after
we
must
pamper
her
must
we
warne
in
his
armchair
by
the
fireside
ready
to
welcome
the
guest
looked
up
at
his
daughter
with
bright
eyes
pampering
said
he
is
the
atmosphere
of
this
house
jeannette
can
not
escape
it
i
am
pampered
beyond
belief
every
day
of
my
life
at
this
very
moment
my
eyes
are
feasting
upon
the
sight
of
my
child
in
what
must
be
an
absolutely
new
old
dress
a
peculiar
expression
crossed
georgiana
face
as
she
glanced
down
at
the
soft
of
the
afternoon
frock
she
had
donned
for
the
occasion
i
wondering
if
she
will
recognize
it
she
murmured
it
was
one
of
the
white
evening
gowns
in
that
last
i
coloured
it
myself
as
usual
it
really
came
out
pretty
well
but
it
gives
me
a
queer
conscious
feeling
to
be
wearing
it
when
i
meet
her
do
you
suppose
she
know
it
father
davy
and
if
she
does
the
tone
was
that
of
a
tender
irony
i
suppose
i
an
idiot
to
care
i
do
care
i
georgiana
flung
a
look
at
the
slim
man
in
the
big
chair
which
said
that
she
was
confident
of
his
understanding
her
no
matter
what
she
said
no
false
pride
daughter
he
warned
her
you
can
tell
the
big
man
from
the
little
one
by
the
character
of
the
things
he
is
willing
to
accept
there
was
never
any
stigma
attached
to
wearing
the
discarded
garments
of
another
provided
they
were
come
by
honestly
and
when
one
has
coloured
them
into
the
bargain
and
looks
like
the
of
a
lady
in
them
father
davy
you
the
most
comforting
creature
and
georgiana
dropped
a
kiss
upon
the
top
of
the
head
which
rested
against
the
back
of
the
worn
old
armchair
if
she
had
not
been
watching
from
the
window
she
would
not
have
known
when
the
crofton
car
drew
up
at
the
door
so
quietly
did
the
great
shining
motor
roll
down
the
macadamized
road
which
ran
through
the
main
street
of
the
little
town
she
was
out
and
down
the
manse
path
in
hospitable
alacrity
yet
not
without
the
dignity
of
which
she
was
mistress
so
this
was
the
guest
whom
she
had
ventured
to
ask
down
to
the
hospitality
of
the
shabby
old
village
manse
if
she
had
been
a
princess
miss
jeannette
crofton
could
not
more
thoroughly
have
looked
the
part
georgiana
had
known
many
rich
men
daughters
at
college
and
had
found
close
friends
among
them
but
no
one
of
them
had
ever
suggested
such
a
background
of
luxury
as
did
this
slim
and
graceful
girl
as
she
set
her
pretty
foot
upon
the
old
gravel
path
she
was
rather
small
of
stature
her
beauty
was
of
a
strikingly
attractive
type
and
every
detail
of
her
attire
and
belongings
breathed
of
wealth
and
fashion
georgiana
felt
herself
instantly
a
buxom
milkmaid
beside
her
chapter
vi
when
royalty
comes
it
was
so
good
of
you
to
ask
me
said
jeannette
in
a
voice
of
much
sweetness
as
she
put
out
her
hand
to
her
cousin
then
she
turned
to
the
man
in
livery
who
stood
at
attention
by
the
door
of
the
car
you
may
take
this
coat
back
with
you
dennis
she
said
and
she
let
him
remove
from
her
shoulders
the
long
cloak
she
had
worn
for
the
march
drive
he
gathered
together
her
belongings
as
she
walked
up
the
path
with
georgiana
and
he
afterward
went
back
for
a
long
motor
trunk
which
had
been
brought
upon
the
back
of
the
car
besides
this
was
a
larger
receptacle
of
black
leather
which
he
brought
and
deposited
in
the
hall
dennis
can
take
all
these
to
my
room
for
me
said
jeannette
with
more
appreciation
of
the
situation
than
georgiana
had
expected
dennis
did
not
look
altogether
pleased
with
this
task
but
he
performed
it
and
was
rewarded
by
a
smile
from
his
young
mistress
which
promised
to
soothe
his
injured
dignity
at
some
future
time
warne
rising
slowly
from
the
armchair
as
jeannette
was
brought
into
his
presence
looked
keenly
into
the
face
of
his
sister
daughter
her
fine
clothing
was
nothing
to
him
he
could
not
have
told
what
she
wore
but
he
was
interested
in
learning
what
she
might
be
herself
it
was
something
of
a
test
for
any
stranger
the
meeting
of
that
clear
look
of
his
kindly
though
it
was
sure
to
be
with
all
his
appearance
of
frailty
and
exhaustion
one
felt
instinctively
that
whatever
had
happened
to
the
body
the
mind
was
intact
and
resolute
with
energy
the
judgment
swift
and
accurate
as
they
all
took
tea
together
georgiana
could
feel
their
guest
striving
to
adjust
herself
to
her
entertainers
her
manner
was
very
charming
though
a
little
languid
a
little
weary
as
if
she
were
tired
with
her
long
drive
and
with
other
things
besides
but
there
was
that
about
her
which
proclaimed
her
unmistakably
the
gentlewoman
and
this
was
good
to
know
she
got
on
well
with
her
newly
discovered
uncle
and
he
with
her
indeed
the
simplicity
and
of
father
davy
manner
with
every
one
his
keen
observation
his
ready
imagination
would
have
put
him
instantly
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
most
exalted
of
his
it
could
do
no
less
with
his
niece
no
matter
how
new
to
her
his
type
of
man
might
be
nor
how
new
to
him
the
fashion
of
her
speech
and
smile
this
was
a
pleasant
beginning
but
if
georgiana
before
her
guest
arrived
had
thought
the
old
house
shabby
she
felt
it
now
to
be
positively
shambling
she
struggled
mightily
against
this
attitude
of
mind
knowing
that
it
was
unworthy
of
her
but
as
she
led
this
wonderful
winsome
creature
whom
she
knew
to
be
accustomed
only
to
the
softnesses
of
life
up
over
the
worn
stair
carpeting
to
the
room
she
had
prepared
for
her
she
was
wondering
how
she
herself
had
ever
conceived
the
preposterous
idea
of
inviting
her
cousin
to
visit
her
the
task
of
making
this
daughter
of
luxury
comfortable
even
for
a
fortnight
seemed
suddenly
so
impossible
oh
how
very
attractive
exclaimed
jeannette
as
she
was
taken
into
the
room
over
which
georgiana
had
spent
so
much
thought
i
shall
love
it
here
that
was
to
be
her
attitude
thought
georgiana
being
exceedingly
the
guest
was
prepared
to
like
everything
that
was
done
for
her
though
this
was
precisely
what
was
to
be
expected
and
desired
georgiana
found
herself
already
irritated
by
it
most
unreasonably
it
must
be
admitted
i
a
jealous
goose
said
she
sternly
to
herself
and
fell
to
helping
her
cousin
there
was
something
appealing
about
the
girl
helplessness
because
she
evidently
tried
hard
not
to
show
it
as
the
two
lifted
the
garments
from
the
carefully
packed
trunk
trays
it
was
georgiana
who
found
the
right
places
for
them
in
clothespress
and
bureau
drawers
she
had
seldom
seen
never
handled
such
exquisite
apparel
from
the
piles
of
sheer
linen
to
the
frocks
and
wraps
and
négligés
which
went
into
retirement
on
the
padded
hangers
she
had
provided
she
realized
too
that
elaborate
as
seemed
to
her
the
array
of
clothing
jeannette
had
thought
it
necessary
to
bring
for
her
visit
it
was
probable
that
the
girl
herself
had
felt
that
she
was
having
packed
only
the
simplest
of
her
wardrobe
and
the
least
that
a
civilized
being
could
do
with
it
was
when
jeannette
herself
spread
forth
upon
the
little
cleverly
contrived
out
of
an
old
washstand
a
long
and
narrow
mirror
and
some
odds
and
ends
of
muslin
and
lace
the
articles
she
was
accustomed
to
use
every
day
of
her
life
but
which
might
have
been
matched
only
in
the
homes
of
princes
that
the
young
hostess
found
it
hardest
to
control
the
pang
of
envy
which
smote
her
such
silver
such
crystal
such
genuine
ivory
and
such
sheer
beauty
of
design
and
finish
yet
jeannette
was
almost
awkward
in
her
disposal
of
the
imposing
array
saying
with
a
laugh
that
she
really
could
remember
how
the
things
went
at
home
but
that
it
did
matter
in
the
least
she
set
about
removing
her
traveling
clothes
as
if
she
never
had
been
waited
upon
in
her
life
it
was
only
when
she
failed
to
discover
how
she
was
put
together
that
georgiana
had
to
come
to
the
rescue
it
dreadfully
stupid
of
me
protested
jeannette
her
delicate
cheeks
flushing
but
i
simply
ca
find
that
absurd
hook
it
was
then
that
georgiana
frankly
took
the
situation
by
its
horns
and
did
away
with
all
embarrassment
you
must
let
me
help
you
jean
she
said
finishing
the
unhooking
with
ease
whenever
you
need
it
i
shall
love
to
do
it
for
you
might
have
rather
a
bad
time
trying
to
do
everything
for
yourself
there
you
are
and
please
call
me
when
you
are
ready
to
be
fastened
into
your
other
frock
i
just
around
the
corner
and
there
nobody
else
at
home
now
before
supper
was
served
georgiana
prepared
her
cousin
to
meet
the
boarder
not
on
any
account
would
she
have
let
his
presence
be
accounted
for
on
the
score
of
his
being
a
guest
in
the
house
not
even
would
she
call
him
a
paying
guest
jefferson
came
to
us
through
a
letter
from
a
friend
he
said
he
wanted
a
quiet
place
to
work
in
away
from
all
interruptions
by
friends
or
claims
of
any
sort
he
is
writing
a
book
and
we
see
as
little
of
him
as
if
he
were
not
in
the
house
except
at
the
table
i
think
you
will
like
him
it
so
long
since
we
have
had
a
man
in
the
house
we
not
yet
used
to
it
but
on
the
whole
it
rather
comforting
how
interesting
to
have
a
book
being
written
in
the
house
is
it
fact
or
fiction
do
you
know
i
do
imagine
it
fiction
he
has
piles
of
reference
books
and
a
great
deal
of
mail
and
somehow
he
does
look
as
if
he
wrote
fiction
yet
as
jefferson
came
into
the
that
night
georgiana
found
herself
wondering
why
she
should
think
he
did
not
look
as
if
he
would
write
fiction
not
foolish
fiction
certainly
but
sensible
fiction
made
possible
by
keen
observation
and
set
off
by
a
capacity
for
quiet
possibly
even
biting
humour
he
looked
at
least
as
if
he
might
write
essays
thoughtful
clever
essays
full
of
searching
analyses
of
his
fellow
human
creatures
of
their
oddities
their
hopes
their
aspirations
their
sins
and
their
virtues
or
was
he
after
all
writing
on
scientific
matters
facts
pure
and
simple
inferences
deductions
conclusions
from
facts
she
wondered
more
than
she
had
yet
done
as
to
the
nature
of
his
work
i
think
jefferson
is
delightful
said
jeannette
cordially
beside
the
fire
when
supper
was
over
and
the
boarder
after
lingering
in
the
doorway
for
a
minute
but
declining
on
the
score
of
work
warne
invitation
to
enter
had
gone
his
way
upstairs
on
this
first
night
georgiana
had
let
the
disordered
dining
table
wait
and
had
accompanied
the
others
to
the
fireside
as
if
she
had
a
dozen
servants
to
attend
to
her
household
affairs
after
this
she
wo
notice
so
much
she
had
argued
with
herself
i
do
want
to
have
her
offering
to
help
i
do
mean
to
do
a
thing
differently
on
her
account
but
i
ca
help
well
at
the
dishes
the
very
first
minute
after
supper
a
man
of
fine
intellect
father
davy
responded
to
his
observation
and
accustomed
to
think
worthy
thoughts
one
can
see
that
at
once
it
is
a
real
pleasure
to
have
him
here
it
is
good
for
us
too
georgiana
and
i
were
growing
narrow
before
he
came
he
has
broadened
us
we
get
his
point
of
view
on
subjects
that
we
thought
had
been
disposed
of
for
all
time
and
find
them
not
disposed
of
at
all
before
the
moment
arrived
when
in
georgiana
mind
the
waiting
work
in
the
kitchen
must
be
done
without
further
postponement
the
front
door
was
besieged
by
james
stuart
a
basket
of
late
winter
apples
in
hand
he
came
in
looking
the
image
of
vigorous
youth
his
figure
showing
its
best
in
the
irreproachable
clothes
he
always
wore
when
his
day
work
was
over
his
manner
as
usual
that
of
the
friend
of
the
house
he
had
not
received
georgiana
permission
to
come
in
upon
this
first
evening
of
miss
crofton
visit
but
he
had
taken
his
welcome
for
granted
and
was
not
disappointed
in
receiving
it
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
glad
to
see
his
smiling
face
for
his
good
looks
were
backed
by
a
capacity
for
adapting
himself
to
whatever
company
he
might
find
himself
in
though
it
should
be
of
the
most
distinguished
presenting
stuart
to
her
cousin
it
occurred
to
georgiana
to
wonder
as
to
the
impression
each
must
make
upon
the
other
jeannette
was
wearing
a
frock
of
a
peculiar
shade
of
blue
which
the
firelight
and
lamplight
instead
of
dulling
seemed
to
make
almost
to
glow
it
was
the
sort
of
apparently
simple
attire
which
is
the
product
of
high
art
and
in
it
sitting
just
where
all
lights
seemed
to
play
together
upon
hair
and
cheek
and
perfect
throat
the
visitor
was
as
georgiana
owned
to
herself
certainly
worth
looking
at
she
left
them
together
presently
and
went
off
to
the
kitchen
here
she
covered
from
view
with
a
big
pinafore
her
own
undeniably
attractive
figure
and
fell
upon
her
task
proceeding
to
dispatch
it
with
all
the
speed
compatible
with
quiet
she
had
cleared
the
table
and
having
arranged
her
dishes
in
orderly
piles
was
just
filling
her
dishpan
with
the
steaming
water
which
made
suds
as
it
fell
upon
the
soap
when
a
familiar
footstep
was
heard
upon
the
bare
kitchen
floor
georgiana
looked
over
her
shoulder
words
of
reproof
upon
her
lips
well
having
come
without
an
invitation
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
stay
where
you
belong
and
entertain
the
guest
there
a
characteristic
welcome
for
you
the
intruder
seemed
in
no
wise
daunted
by
his
reception
but
picked
up
a
dish
towel
and
stood
at
ease
waiting
the
placing
of
the
first
tumbler
in
the
rinsing
pan
and
where
should
i
belong
if
not
standing
by
a
chum
in
distress
i
not
in
distress
if
you
please
do
mind
washing
dishes
while
the
guest
sits
by
the
fire
not
a
bit
more
than
usual
georgiana
amended
honestly
why
do
you
pile
up
and
let
wait
till
morning
i
should
sleep
for
thinking
of
them
my
word
but
you
a
hustler
i
do
know
whether
i
can
keep
up
do
try
go
back
to
the
other
room
please
jimps
you
can
be
of
real
use
there
well
i
like
that
as
he
wiped
away
assiduously
stuart
surveyed
his
companion
face
in
profile
it
belied
the
dictatorial
words
for
georgiana
was
smiling
her
cheeks
were
of
a
splendid
colour
her
dark
hair
drooped
over
the
prettiest
white
forehead
in
the
world
and
the
whole
outline
of
her
face
was
distracting
here
was
a
lamplight
effect
which
rivalled
the
one
in
the
though
it
was
thrown
from
a
common
kitchen
lamp
unshaded
and
fell
upon
a
figure
in
a
checked
apron
georgiana
glanced
at
her
assistant
and
encountered
the
flash
of
an
eye
which
told
her
that
however
stuart
objected
to
her
words
he
liked
the
look
of
what
he
saw
is
jeannette
a
beauty
she
inquired
hastily
and
plunged
her
hands
into
her
pan
with
such
energy
that
she
sent
a
splash
of
hot
soapy
water
upon
stuart
cheek
he
surreptitiously
wiped
it
off
with
a
corner
of
his
dish
towel
she
sure
is
he
assented
cordially
i
was
prepared
for
quite
such
a
looker
she
does
seem
to
have
brought
with
her
that
proud
and
haughty
expression
she
had
in
the
sunday
papers
she
a
dear
and
not
in
the
least
proud
and
haughty
i
going
to
enjoy
her
visit
i
know
if
i
can
only
make
her
enjoy
it
i
be
glad
to
help
stuart
offered
this
is
a
very
promising
time
of
year
for
the
country
but
if
you
think
she
like
any
of
the
good
times
we
can
give
her
here
i
get
them
up
our
sort
of
good
times
is
just
what
i
do
want
to
give
her
she
had
enough
of
her
own
kind
and
needs
the
diversion
what
would
you
get
up
for
instance
i
take
overnight
to
think
it
out
but
i
can
promise
you
it
be
an
outdoor
affair
would
she
be
up
to
any
kind
of
a
tramp
do
you
think
oh
no
jimps
not
yet
at
any
rate
all
right
i
harness
up
my
best
team
and
carry
her
most
of
the
way
we
must
have
another
man
i
suppose
shall
we
ask
the
literary
light
just
for
a
lark
it
would
give
tone
to
the
company
to
have
him
along
eh
he
probably
would
go
do
you
fool
yourself
a
fellow
who
covers
as
many
miles
a
day
as
he
does
will
jump
at
it
no
matter
how
important
his
next
chapter
is
do
you
know
i
have
to
admit
i
rather
like
him
since
i
tramped
a
couple
of
miles
in
his
company
the
other
day
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
ideas
in
his
head
and
i
got
him
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
a
few
of
them
drew
him
out
you
know
though
to
be
strictly
honest
with
a
laugh
when
i
thought
it
over
afterward
i
was
exactly
sure
that
he
had
drawn
me
out
rather
more
than
i
drew
him
anyhow
the
interest
seemed
to
be
mutual
and
that
flattered
me
a
bit
it
perfectly
evident
that
he
a
great
student
of
affairs
they
finished
the
work
at
a
gallop
georgiana
slipped
off
her
pinafore
and
stuart
who
had
insisted
on
waiting
for
her
hung
it
upon
its
accustomed
nail
do
you
suppose
pretty
cousin
ever
wore
one
he
queried
chapter
vii
snowballs
jefferson
laid
down
his
pen
ran
his
hand
through
his
heavy
brown
hair
rumpling
it
still
more
than
it
had
been
rumpled
before
which
is
saying
considerable
and
stretched
his
legs
under
the
table
upon
which
he
had
been
writing
steadily
since
one
he
heaved
a
mighty
breath
stretched
his
arms
to
match
his
legs
looked
round
at
his
windows
which
faced
the
west
and
so
had
kept
him
supplied
with
strong
light
longer
than
windows
on
any
other
side
of
the
house
would
have
done
and
took
out
his
watch
nearly
four
time
and
more
than
time
for
his
late
afternoon
tramp
he
set
the
piles
of
sheets
before
him
in
order
sheathed
his
pen
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
rose
from
his
place
the
light
of
achievement
in
his
eye
but
crampiness
and
fatigue
in
all
his
limbs
as
he
approached
his
windows
to
ascertain
what
kind
of
weather
was
to
be
found
outside
he
became
aware
of
sounds
which
would
indicate
that
some
event
of
activity
and
hilarity
was
going
on
below
he
realized
now
that
he
had
been
hearing
these
sounds
quite
without
hearing
them
after
the
fashion
of
the
absorbed
workman
for
the
last
looking
out
he
beheld
an
interesting
affair
in
full
swing
at
each
end
of
the
side
yard
the
heavy
snow
which
a
late
march
storm
had
brought
overnight
had
been
shovelled
and
manipulated
into
the
semblance
of
a
fort
such
as
lads
are
wont
to
make
between
these
two
entrenchments
a
battle
was
raging
but
it
was
no
lads
who
held
the
places
of
the
combatants
instead
as
he
looked
jefferson
saw
rising
warily
from
behind
the
fort
nearest
him
a
girlish
figure
in
a
scarlet
blanket
suit
its
dark
head
half
shielded
by
a
scarlet
toboggan
cap
very
much
awry
a
mittened
hand
flung
a
snowball
with
strength
and
precision
straight
into
the
opposite
fort
and
the
assailant
immediately
dodged
down
behind
the
embankment
from
the
opposing
stronghold
then
cautiously
appeared
a
head
snugly
bound
in
a
blue
scarf
from
which
locks
of
fair
hair
escaped
at
divers
points
a
second
snowball
accompanied
by
a
loose
flutter
of
snow
wended
its
way
uncertainly
through
the
air
and
fell
a
foot
short
of
the
fort
behind
which
crouched
the
scarlet
figure
the
figure
immediately
rose
and
fired
an
answering
volley
peals
of
laughter
and
gay
shouts
rang
through
the
air
at
this
very
moment
a
third
person
ran
into
the
yard
from
the
street
calling
for
shame
george
i
going
to
take
sides
with
the
enemy
and
we
have
you
out
in
no
time
jefferson
saw
this
third
figure
in
sweater
and
cap
dash
across
the
open
narrowly
escaping
a
vigorous
shower
of
missiles
from
the
near
fort
and
disappear
behind
the
farther
one
the
battle
was
now
on
in
earnest
let
scarlet
toboggan
fire
as
fast
and
as
furiously
as
she
might
a
merciless
bombardment
of
her
protecting
walls
had
begun
the
girl
in
the
blue
scarf
and
priceless
furs
had
sunk
laughing
upon
the
floor
of
her
refuge
while
her
new
ally
bringing
to
bear
the
full
strength
and
skill
of
his
sex
battered
at
the
entrenchments
across
the
yard
and
began
to
make
havoc
thereon
georgiana
was
a
brave
foe
but
though
she
fought
with
surprising
endurance
she
was
beginning
to
be
seriously
worsted
several
feet
of
her
snow
rampart
having
been
shot
away
when
a
voice
behind
her
cried
out
a
command
and
an
arm
more
sinewy
than
hers
sent
a
hard
shot
whizzing
past
her
head
into
the
opposite
fort
with
that
directness
of
aim
and
effectiveness
of
delivery
which
only
the
male
arm
can
accomplish
duck
down
and
make
snowballs
while
i
fire
the
voice
ordered
and
georgiana
breathless
but
still
undaunted
obeyed
keep
behind
me
and
pile
the
balls
at
the
right
directed
jefferson
his
voice
was
eager
as
a
boy
he
also
had
pulled
on
sweater
and
cap
and
as
he
and
james
stuart
faced
each
other
across
the
twenty
yards
which
separated
them
they
might
have
been
a
couple
of
wrestling
for
supremacy
keep
coming
faster
faster
stuart
urged
jeannette
the
lust
of
battle
upon
him
stop
laughing
and
work
george
is
a
he
stooped
to
make
a
ball
for
himself
fiend
at
making
you
got
to
learn
keep
coming
the
wet
snow
was
precisely
in
the
right
state
for
quick
packing
and
georgiana
was
indeed
an
expert
at
the
business
jefferson
found
her
hard
round
balls
splendid
missiles
and
he
used
them
with
all
the
energy
of
an
arm
which
welcomed
the
change
from
the
labours
of
the
past
hours
to
those
of
the
present
ha
there
goes
that
left
corner
he
exulted
with
his
as
the
last
of
a
series
of
shots
reduced
a
part
of
the
enemies
defences
to
a
gratifying
slump
and
here
comes
a
bit
of
ours
he
added
as
a
ball
of
stuart
ploughed
through
a
weakened
upper
portion
of
their
own
rampart
he
be
game
to
the
last
panted
georgiana
working
furiously
so
will
we
we
fight
to
a
finish
if
we
go
without
our
suppers
the
battle
raged
on
the
combatants
took
no
heed
of
passing
time
until
jeannette
growing
reckless
with
excitement
lifted
an
incautious
head
and
received
a
spent
ball
full
upon
her
chin
no
harm
was
done
as
she
protested
but
stuart
raised
a
flag
of
truce
and
jefferson
ran
across
the
lines
to
apologize
it
did
hurt
a
bit
jeannette
reaffirmed
showing
a
very
pink
chin
it
lucky
it
did
i
was
properly
protecting
you
stuart
declared
warmly
both
sides
come
in
to
supper
commanded
georgiana
please
stay
jimps
it
the
only
amends
we
can
make
you
and
you
must
be
as
hungry
as
a
bear
thanks
i
like
to
but
i
not
properly
dressed
i
afraid
jean
and
i
wo
make
a
change
and
you
can
take
us
coasting
this
evening
if
you
will
do
you
suppose
jefferson
would
dream
of
staving
off
his
dignity
a
bit
longer
and
going
too
they
all
looked
at
the
person
mentioned
and
their
glances
were
all
gayly
audacious
is
that
an
invitation
or
a
challenge
he
put
it
to
georgiana
whichever
you
choose
to
take
it
i
take
it
as
i
choose
then
and
accept
the
spirit
of
sport
is
upon
me
i
could
work
this
evening
if
i
tried
good
for
you
work
and
no
play
you
know
quoted
stuart
as
they
went
in
together
a
moist
and
merry
company
upstairs
while
jeannette
dried
her
hair
she
reflected
that
she
know
when
she
had
had
so
gay
a
time
she
ran
in
to
say
this
to
georgiana
but
found
that
that
young
woman
had
already
put
her
hair
in
order
without
drying
it
as
its
damply
curling
locks
above
her
forehead
testified
and
was
rushing
away
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
wo
you
take
cold
suggested
jeannette
struggling
with
her
own
wet
braids
and
very
naturally
wishing
for
her
maid
to
dry
and
put
them
in
order
mercy
no
not
over
the
kitchen
stove
they
be
dry
soon
enough
was
the
reply
and
georgiana
vanished
the
supper
on
her
mind
when
jeannette
came
down
half
an
hour
later
and
appeared
in
the
kitchen
doorway
she
saw
that
the
speed
of
her
young
hostess
labours
and
the
warmth
of
the
kitchen
were
quite
likely
to
prevent
all
chance
of
undried
locks
there
was
system
about
georgiana
work
fast
as
was
its
pace
each
trip
across
the
floor
from
pantry
to
and
back
again
demonstrated
housewifely
efficiency
both
hands
were
always
full
and
she
seemed
never
to
forget
what
she
meant
to
do
if
she
passed
the
stove
on
her
way
somewhere
she
stopped
to
stir
something
or
to
glance
into
the
oven
and
when
she
went
to
the
storeroom
for
cream
she
brought
away
bread
and
butter
as
well
jeannette
commented
admiringly
do
you
ever
forget
and
have
to
run
back
for
something
she
inquired
goodness
yes
but
when
you
been
over
certain
ground
several
million
times
it
a
pity
if
you
ca
make
your
head
save
your
heels
as
a
rule
excuse
me
dear
but
if
you
would
mind
standing
just
a
foot
or
two
to
the
left
jeannette
turned
i
see
i
in
the
way
when
i
like
so
much
to
help
is
there
anything
i
could
do
all
done
thank
you
except
would
you
just
arrange
that
boxful
of
scarlet
geraniums
jimps
brought
over
for
the
table
that
would
help
very
much
take
any
bowl
or
glass
from
the
cupboard
that
looks
appropriate
to
you
i
love
to
and
jeannette
fell
to
work
if
it
could
be
called
work
never
in
her
life
had
she
arranged
scarlet
geraniums
as
a
table
decoration
or
for
that
matter
seen
them
so
used
but
as
she
placed
the
splendid
thrifty
blooms
each
with
its
accompanying
rich
green
leaves
in
the
plain
brown
bowl
which
she
felt
best
matched
their
undistinguished
beauty
she
discovered
for
the
first
time
that
other
blossoms
besides
roses
and
orchids
chrysanthemums
and
the
rest
of
the
ordinary
florists
products
may
charm
the
eye
from
the
centre
of
a
snowy
cloth
that
gorgeous
thank
you
so
much
are
they
the
jolliest
flowers
in
the
world
for
a
winter
night
jimps
greenhouses
certainly
are
doing
well
do
you
want
a
bit
of
a
blossom
in
your
hair
their
grower
would
feel
tremendously
complimented
red
not
my
colour
but
it
is
yours
let
me
tuck
this
little
sprig
in
these
braids
and
i
risk
the
grower
being
better
pleased
than
if
i
wore
them
georgiana
submitted
and
promptly
forgot
all
about
the
scarlet
decoration
but
the
others
did
not
found
forgetting
it
indeed
quite
impossible
as
they
gathered
about
the
table
it
caught
the
eye
of
each
in
turn
georgiana
cheeks
from
the
vigorous
exercise
in
the
frosty
air
were
glowing
brilliantly
her
eyes
were
wonderful
to
look
at
her
dark
cloth
dress
had
upon
it
no
relief
of
colour
so
the
scarlet
geranium
in
her
hair
was
the
touch
of
the
artist
which
drew
the
eye
and
held
it
she
had
placed
upon
the
table
instead
of
the
customary
lamp
one
of
the
few
treasures
of
the
house
a
fine
old
candelabrum
with
pendent
crystals
and
the
burning
candles
threw
their
mellow
light
directly
into
her
face
she
looked
up
suddenly
after
having
served
each
one
from
the
dish
before
her
and
found
them
all
looking
at
her
james
stuart
fork
was
suspended
above
his
plate
but
the
others
had
not
yet
taken
theirs
she
gazed
at
them
in
amazement
why
what
is
the
matter
she
cried
do
i
is
something
queer
about
me
have
i
missed
a
point
somebody
has
made
they
all
turned
then
laughing
to
their
plates
and
nobody
would
tell
her
what
was
wrong
stuart
seemed
to
think
it
a
great
joke
her
mystification
when
she
removed
the
plates
for
the
second
course
there
were
but
two
in
the
simple
hearty
little
supper
she
glanced
into
the
small
kitchen
mirror
her
eye
caught
the
scarlet
geranium
i
suppose
i
look
ridiculously
sentimental
with
that
flower
just
there
she
thought
but
i
wo
take
it
out
after
jean
put
it
there
no
wonder
they
laughed
an
hour
afterward
they
were
all
out
upon
the
hill
nearby
stuart
possessed
a
splendid
pair
of
bobs
and
they
were
soon
dashing
down
the
hill
at
a
pace
which
while
it
made
jeannette
hold
her
breath
with
mingled
fear
and
joy
made
georgiana
cry
out
oh
is
there
anything
so
glorious
and
made
jefferson
just
behind
her
watching
over
her
shoulder
respond
with
heartiness
the
snow
fight
took
five
years
off
my
age
and
now
here
goes
another
five
i
must
be
almost
as
young
as
you
are
now
miss
warne
oh
no
i
only
ten
myself
she
answered
coasting
was
one
of
my
earliest
joys
i
was
so
proud
when
i
could
steer
jimps
first
pair
of
bobs
small
and
primitive
ones
compared
with
these
she
found
jefferson
beside
her
when
it
came
to
the
walk
back
up
the
hill
a
new
side
of
him
was
visible
he
was
not
the
quiet
student
and
writer
the
man
who
discussed
with
her
father
and
herself
the
course
of
the
world
events
or
the
problems
of
social
service
but
a
boy
much
like
stuart
and
ready
to
abet
all
the
other
man
efforts
for
the
amusement
of
the
party
the
fun
went
on
for
an
hour
then
jeannette
unaccustomed
to
so
much
vigorous
exercise
began
quite
against
her
will
to
show
evidences
of
fatigue
and
after
one
particularly
long
swift
flight
the
party
went
back
to
the
house
there
followed
another
gay
hour
before
the
fire
while
stuart
roasted
chestnuts
and
georgiana
sitting
on
the
floor
against
her
father
knee
told
stones
of
madcap
pranks
at
college
illustrating
them
by
such
changes
of
facial
expression
and
such
significant
gestures
that
her
hearers
spent
themselves
with
their
laughter
jeannette
lying
back
in
a
shabby
but
comfortable
old
armchair
looked
and
listened
with
the
absorbed
interest
of
one
to
whom
such
simple
pleasures
as
these
had
the
flavour
of
absolute
novelty
her
eyes
wandered
from
georgiana
vivid
face
to
her
father
delicate
one
to
james
stuart
comely
features
glowing
ruddily
in
the
firelight
as
he
tended
his
chestnuts
showing
splendid
white
teeth
as
he
roared
at
georgiana
clever
mimicry
or
turned
to
laugh
into
jeannette
eyes
as
he
offered
her
a
particularly
plump
and
succulently
bursting
specimen
of
his
labours
to
jefferson
maturer
personality
his
brown
eyes
keenly
intent
his
face
lighted
with
enjoyment
his
occasional
comments
on
georgiana
adventures
flashing
with
a
dry
humour
which
matched
hers
and
sometimes
quite
outdid
it
to
jeannette
they
were
all
an
engrossing
study
as
for
herself
she
the
loveliest
thing
i
ever
saw
thought
georgiana
from
time
to
time
as
she
glanced
up
at
her
cousin
whose
fair
hair
against
the
dark
cushion
of
the
old
chair
caught
and
held
the
charm
of
the
fire
own
warmth
in
its
gleaming
strands
jeannette
eyes
were
matchless
by
lamplight
her
cheeks
and
lips
were
glowing
from
the
outdoor
life
of
the
day
and
evening
her
smile
was
a
thing
to
imprison
hearts
and
hold
them
fast
if
she
spoke
little
no
one
thought
of
her
as
silent
and
the
charm
of
her
low
laughter
at
the
sallies
of
the
others
was
the
sheerest
flattery
it
was
so
evidently
born
of
genuine
delight
in
the
cleverness
she
did
not
attempt
to
emulate
i
a
clown
beside
her
said
georgiana
to
herself
who
cares
how
a
woman
talks
when
she
looks
like
that
every
line
of
her
is
absolute
grace
and
beauty
every
turn
of
her
head
is
fascination
itself
i
never
saw
such
eyes
that
little
twist
in
the
corner
of
her
lip
when
she
smiles
is
the
most
delicious
thing
i
ever
saw
jimps
looks
at
it
forty
times
in
every
five
minutes
and
i
ca
blame
him
jefferson
keeps
his
chair
facing
that
way
so
he
can
have
her
all
the
time
in
focus
though
he
does
eat
her
up
as
jimps
does
i
ca
blame
either
of
them
and
i
shall
go
on
being
a
clown
because
that
what
i
can
do
and
it
amuses
them
if
i
should
lie
back
in
a
chair
like
that
and
just
smile
without
saying
anything
father
davy
would
say
do
you
feel
quite
well
and
jimps
would
propose
getting
me
a
cup
of
tea
oh
well
how
absurd
of
me
to
mind
because
another
girl
looks
like
a
picture
by
a
wonderful
painter
while
i
look
like
a
lurid
lithograph
by
nobody
at
all
whereupon
she
set
her
strong
white
teeth
into
a
hot
roasted
chestnut
cracked
it
and
regarding
the
halves
said
this
reminds
me
of
the
night
prexy
lost
his
head
and
brought
down
the
house
with
the
merriest
tale
of
all
it
was
so
irresistibly
absurd
that
jeannette
helpless
with
her
mirth
buried
her
face
in
her
cobweb
handkerchief
stuart
rocked
upon
his
knees
and
made
the
welkin
ring
and
jefferson
laughed
in
a
growling
bass
that
gathered
volume
as
the
preposterousness
of
the
situation
grew
upon
him
with
consideration
of
it
even
warne
whose
expressions
of
amusement
were
usually
noiseless
gave
way
to
soft
little
chuckles
of
appreciation
and
wiped
his
eyes
georgiana
finishing
her
chestnut
looked
upon
them
all
and
told
them
they
were
the
most
gratifying
audience
she
had
ever
addressed
but
that
she
feared
it
was
not
good
for
them
to
give
way
to
their
emotions
so
unrestrainedly
and
that
she
should
therefore
not
open
her
lips
again
that
night
as
they
found
it
impossible
to
break
down
this
resolution
even
with
entreaties
backed
by
offerings
of
worldly
goods
the
party
broke
up
georgiana
carried
off
her
guest
to
put
her
to
bed
with
her
own
hands
while
jefferson
and
james
stuart
smoked
a
bedtime
pipe
together
in
the
boarder
room
after
which
stuart
let
himself
quietly
out
of
a
door
that
was
never
locked
to
reflect
as
he
tramped
homeward
over
the
snow
on
what
an
inordinately
jolly
evening
it
had
been
chapter
viii
soapsuds
will
you
think
i
dreadful
georgiana
dear
asked
jeannette
lying
luxuriously
back
upon
her
pillow
while
her
cousin
sat
braiding
her
own
thick
locks
by
the
little
bedroom
fireplace
in
which
the
last
remnants
of
the
fire
were
smouldering
if
i
say
i
should
have
believed
i
could
possibly
have
such
a
good
time
in
such
a
way
i
never
did
anything
the
least
bit
like
it
never
coasted
never
never
threw
snowballs
not
that
i
can
remember
nor
roasted
chestnuts
i
never
tasted
one
before
except
perhaps
in
the
stuffing
of
a
fowl
poor
child
but
at
least
you
sat
by
the
fire
with
other
girls
and
men
and
told
stories
little
jean
the
guest
considered
of
course
at
house
parties
yet
i
ca
seem
to
recall
any
such
scene
as
the
one
we
just
left
down
by
your
fire
i
certainly
never
sat
on
the
floor
with
my
arm
on
my
father
knee
with
a
group
of
people
around
while
somebody
told
stories
sure
not
such
stories
as
you
told
oh
you
the
cleverest
girl
i
ever
knew
to
tell
such
things
in
such
a
way
it
was
perfectly
splendid
how
those
two
men
did
enjoy
it
i
do
know
when
i
heard
men
laugh
in
just
that
way
just
what
way
please
tell
me
how
they
laughed
differently
from
other
men
to
be
sure
jimps
just
lets
go
when
he
amused
and
raises
the
rafters
with
his
howls
of
glee
but
so
do
other
young
men
of
his
age
and
certainly
jefferson
laughed
decorously
enough
yes
but
it
was
so
with
both
of
them
and
yet
there
a
thing
in
your
stories
but
oh
i
ca
tell
you
just
what
i
mean
if
you
do
know
but
somehow
it
all
struck
me
so
differently
from
the
way
any
evening
ever
struck
me
before
there
there
seems
a
different
air
to
breathe
here
if
that
expresses
it
from
any
i
ever
been
in
the
two
regarded
each
other
jeannette
from
between
deeply
fringed
eyelids
as
she
lay
back
upon
her
pillows
one
arm
half
veiled
with
the
finest
of
linen
and
lace
outstretched
upon
the
treasured
counterpane
the
other
beneath
her
neck
georgiana
sitting
up
straight
with
two
long
dark
braids
hanging
over
her
shoulders
her
dusky
eyes
wide
open
her
cheeks
still
bright
with
colour
balanced
by
the
scarlet
hue
of
the
loose
garment
she
had
put
on
i
no
doubt
there
is
agreed
georgiana
thoughtfully
still
though
you
live
a
very
different
life
from
any
i
ever
known
i
suppose
your
education
in
the
matter
of
roast
chestnuts
and
the
things
that
go
with
them
had
been
quite
so
badly
neglected
to
think
of
never
having
had
them
except
so
disguised
by
the
manipulations
of
a
french
that
you
could
recognize
them
and
to
have
gone
to
balls
and
horse
shows
and
polo
games
and
never
to
have
built
a
snow
fort
dear
dear
what
we
have
to
teach
you
life
has
been
really
fair
to
you
has
it
my
dear
this
was
sheer
audacity
from
a
poor
girl
to
a
rich
one
but
it
was
charming
audacity
none
the
less
and
by
no
means
wholly
ironic
to
jeannette
studying
her
cousin
with
eyes
which
were
envious
of
the
physical
superiority
for
lack
of
which
no
training
in
the
social
arts
or
mere
ability
to
purchase
the
aid
of
dressmaker
and
milliner
could
possibly
atone
conscious
that
georgiana
possessed
a
mind
far
keener
and
better
trained
than
her
own
the
question
called
for
a
serious
answer
she
half
sat
up
and
pushed
her
pillow
into
a
soft
mountain
behind
her
as
she
spoke
no
it
has
i
thought
so
before
i
came
here
and
now
i
sure
of
it
i
feel
a
weak
and
helpless
creature
beside
you
helpless
in
every
way
i
ca
do
anything
you
can
if
my
father
should
lose
his
money
and
i
should
be
thrown
upon
my
own
resources
i
should
be
able
to
make
so
much
as
a
snowball
for
myself
both
laughed
in
spite
of
jeannette
earnestness
for
the
words
brought
back
vivid
memories
of
the
wild
sport
of
the
afternoon
then
ready
brain
leaped
to
the
inevitable
corollary
ah
but
there
be
sure
to
be
a
man
ready
to
dash
into
your
fort
and
make
your
snowballs
for
you
i
not
so
sure
i
am
of
course
the
men
i
know
do
seem
to
mind
whether
a
girl
is
helpless
or
not
if
she
can
look
and
act
the
way
they
want
her
to
but
discovering
that
there
are
other
kinds
of
men
and
somehow
i
like
this
new
kind
and
i
imagine
this
kind
would
care
for
helpless
girls
you
made
snowballs
for
your
man
to
throw
and
they
were
good
hard
ones
as
my
chin
can
still
testify
you
can
learn
to
make
hard
snowballs
said
georgiana
smiling
jeannette
held
up
one
beautifully
modelled
but
undeniably
slender
arm
and
clasped
it
with
her
hand
soft
as
she
paused
for
a
simile
sponge
cake
supplied
georgiana
coming
over
to
feel
critically
of
the
extended
arm
it
pretty
spongy
it
needs
exercise
with
a
punchball
or
she
flashed
a
mischievous
glance
at
the
languid
form
beside
her
a
batch
of
bread
dough
bread
dough
would
that
help
it
rather
so
would
sweeping
and
scrubbing
and
moving
furniture
about
but
you
born
to
a
life
of
ease
my
dear
so
those
things
are
out
of
the
question
for
you
but
fencing
lessons
would
be
good
for
you
and
fashionable
too
which
would
double
their
value
of
course
georgiana
jeannette
sat
straight
up
and
laid
two
coaxing
arms
about
her
cousin
firmly
moulded
neck
teach
me
to
make
bread
will
you
while
i
here
oh
good
gracious
georgiana
threw
back
her
head
to
laugh
hear
the
child
what
good
would
that
do
if
you
learned
you
would
do
it
when
you
went
back
i
would
well
of
course
i
might
have
difficulty
in
but
mother
wants
me
to
be
strong
she
always
fussing
about
it
because
i
ca
endure
the
round
of
society
things
she
says
any
girl
ought
to
and
enjoy
if
you
thought
would
really
help
it
would
be
a
drop
in
the
bucket
of
exercise
you
ought
to
take
nevertheless
i
want
to
learn
persisted
jeannette
as
georgiana
moved
away
evidently
with
the
intention
of
leaving
her
for
the
night
like
to
feel
i
knew
how
and
your
bread
is
the
most
delicious
i
ever
tasted
please
oh
very
well
i
teach
you
with
pleasure
i
shall
be
setting
bread
sponge
at
six
morning
will
you
be
down
georgiana
smile
was
distinctly
wicked
six
there
was
a
look
of
mingled
incredulity
and
horror
in
the
lovely
face
on
the
pillow
but
does
bread
does
bread
have
to
be
made
so
early
absolutely
after
the
morning
dew
is
off
the
grass
bread
becomes
heavy
jeannette
stared
into
the
mocking
eyes
of
her
cousin
then
she
laughed
oh
i
see
you
testing
me
well
with
a
stifled
sigh
i
get
up
if
you
call
me
i
afraid
i
should
never
wake
myself
especially
after
all
that
snowballing
exactly
and
i
not
call
you
so
lie
still
in
your
nest
ladybird
and
do
bother
your
pretty
head
about
bread
sponges
what
the
use
you
never
need
to
know
and
you
soon
forget
having
had
even
a
faint
desire
toward
knowledge
and
sleep
sweetly
oh
but
wait
i
really
serious
please
call
me
never
with
one
laughing
backward
look
and
with
a
kiss
waved
toward
the
slender
figure
now
sitting
up
in
bed
georgiana
opened
the
door
and
fled
that
she
did
not
want
to
teach
her
cousin
an
earthly
thing
even
if
she
could
have
believed
jeannette
serious
in
her
request
was
momentarily
growing
more
evident
to
her
own
consciousness
just
why
she
might
have
been
unwilling
to
explain
next
morning
however
she
found
herself
destined
to
carry
out
the
plan
jeannette
had
so
impulsively
proposed
she
crept
downstairs
as
quietly
as
the
creaking
boards
under
the
worn
stair
carpet
would
permit
and
began
her
work
in
a
whirl
of
haste
but
she
had
not
more
than
assembled
her
ingredients
on
the
scrupulously
scoured
top
of
the
old
pine
table
when
she
heard
the
kitchen
door
softly
open
wheeling
she
beheld
a
vision
which
brought
a
boyish
whistle
to
her
lips
jeannette
enveloped
in
a
long
silken
garment
evidently
thrown
on
over
her
night
attire
a
little
cap
of
lace
and
ribbon
confining
her
hair
the
most
impractical
of
slippers
on
her
feet
stood
smiling
at
her
cousin
sleep
still
clinging
to
her
eyelids
i
down
she
announced
in
triumph
so
i
see
but
you
not
up
replied
georgiana
regarding
the
vision
with
critical
eyes
jeannette
gaze
left
the
trim
morning
garb
of
the
young
cook
her
perfectly
arranged
hair
her
whole
aspect
of
efficiency
and
dropped
to
her
own
highly
inappropriate
attire
and
she
flushed
a
little
but
she
held
her
ground
you
did
call
me
and
when
i
woke
it
was
so
near
six
i
did
dare
wait
to
dress
ca
i
learn
unless
i
dressed
like
you
if
a
french
doll
had
come
to
life
and
offered
to
help
me
in
the
kitchen
i
could
feel
more
stunned
what
will
happen
to
all
those
floating
ends
of
lace
and
ribbon
when
they
get
mixed
with
flour
and
yeast
be
sensible
child
and
go
back
to
bed
i
pin
everything
out
of
the
way
and
perhaps
you
lend
me
an
apron
i
really
do
want
to
bother
you
georgiana
but
i
do
want
to
learn
georgiana
relented
very
well
come
here
and
i
cover
you
up
as
best
i
can
or
i
wait
while
you
run
up
and
dress
if
you
anything
to
put
on
that
fit
for
nothing
much
fitter
than
this
i
afraid
admitted
jeannette
reluctantly
poor
little
girl
georgiana
momentary
irritation
was
gone
as
it
usually
was
in
no
time
at
all
well
here
go
the
frills
under
a
nice
big
gingham
and
now
you
look
like
a
combination
of
sleeping
beauty
and
mother
bunch
all
right
here
we
go
into
business
do
you
know
how
to
scald
that
cupful
of
milk
you
see
before
you
scald
it
repeated
jeannette
doubtfully
and
so
the
lesson
began
absolute
ignorance
on
the
part
of
the
pupil
assured
knowledge
on
that
of
the
teacher
the
lesson
was
a
very
kindergarten
in
methods
there
were
times
when
georgiana
had
much
difficulty
in
restraining
her
inward
mirth
but
she
soon
saw
that
this
must
be
done
though
jeannette
herself
laughed
at
her
own
clumsiness
and
evidently
was
determined
to
let
nothing
escape
her
kneading
looks
so
easy
when
you
do
it
she
lamented
but
i
ca
seem
to
help
getting
stuck
that
will
come
with
practice
if
you
ever
try
another
batch
which
i
doubt
and
it
the
kneading
that
is
so
good
for
your
arms
yours
are
beautiful
and
so
strong
it
must
be
fun
to
own
them
there
are
times
when
a
bit
of
muscle
is
of
use
in
a
hustling
world
admitted
her
cousin
there
i
think
that
dough
will
do
very
well
turn
it
over
and
lay
it
smoothly
in
the
bowl
so
cover
it
with
its
white
blanket
so
and
leave
it
right
here
where
it
will
have
a
good
warm
temperature
to
rise
in
now
run
up
and
snatch
another
nap
you
have
plenty
of
time
you
not
going
back
to
bed
rather
not
georgiana
smile
strove
to
be
tolerant
there
are
just
a
few
things
to
be
done
about
the
house
and
they
are
best
done
before
breakfast
off
with
you
lady
cousin
do
you
always
get
up
so
early
jeannette
persisted
i
have
an
extraordinary
fondness
for
early
rising
georgiana
explained
it
foolish
of
course
but
it
an
old
habit
my
dear
my
next
errand
is
down
cellar
and
she
vanished
from
the
sight
of
her
guest
quite
unable
to
keep
herself
longer
in
hand
before
the
amazing
point
of
view
of
this
daughter
of
luxury
the
next
errand
was
the
washing
of
the
handful
of
fine
towels
with
which
the
painstaking
hostess
was
keeping
the
supplied
unwilling
to
furnish
the
aristocratic
young
person
upstairs
with
the
coarser
articles
used
by
herself
and
the
others
jeannette
all
unaware
that
the
snowy
linen
with
which
her
room
was
kept
plentifully
supplied
was
constantly
relaundered
in
secret
by
georgiana
own
hands
was
as
lavish
in
her
use
of
it
as
she
was
accustomed
to
be
at
home
and
the
result
was
a
quite
unbelievable
amount
of
extra
work
for
her
cousin
warne
coming
upon
his
daughter
by
chance
in
this
very
early
morning
flurry
of
laundering
expressed
himself
upon
the
subject
in
the
gentle
but
positive
way
which
was
his
why
do
it
my
dear
he
questioned
are
the
sheets
and
towels
we
use
not
quite
good
enough
for
others
not
half
good
enough
for
lady
jean
responded
the
laundress
rubbing
energetically
away
yet
carefully
too
for
the
old
linen
was
not
so
stout
as
it
once
had
been
you
are
intentionally
deceiving
her
are
you
daughter
why
do
that
since
it
is
not
necessary
for
her
comfort
but
it
is
she
would
shudder
at
the
touch
of
a
cotton
sheet
as
for
a
common
huck
towel
warne
shook
his
head
i
ca
agree
with
you
so
that
the
sheets
and
towels
are
spotless
as
your
sheets
and
towels
are
the
mere
degree
of
fineness
is
not
essential
and
if
she
knew
how
much
labour
it
costs
you
i
am
very
certain
she
would
infinitely
prefer
to
be
less
of
a
spendthrift
in
the
matter
of
quantity
i
no
doubt
she
would
but
i
rather
wash
my
fingers
off
than
not
give
her
the
fresh
towel
for
her
perfect
face
each
time
she
uses
one
i
like
it
myself
i
like
a
million
towels
all
fine
as
silk
like
she
stopped
abruptly
seeing
the
look
upon
her
father
face
oh
i
sorry
she
flashed
at
him
repentantly
i
truly
do
mind
being
poor
in
most
ways
it
the
lack
of
certain
things
that
go
with
nicety
of
living
that
grinds
me
most
i
should
mind
wearing
gingham
outside
if
i
could
have
all
the
fine
linen
i
want
underneath
it
it
oh
well
you
know
and
i
an
idiot
to
talk
about
it
when
the
thing
we
really
need
is
books
books
for
your
starving
mind
if
i
could
get
you
all
you
want
of
those
her
voice
broke
upon
the
wish
always
strong
with
her
my
dear
my
mind
will
never
starve
while
it
has
the
old
books
to
feed
upon
listen
on
what
a
pertinent
thought
did
i
come
this
morning
i
was
delving
in
good
old
thomas
fuller
of
those
fine
writers
whose
works
still
glow
with
fire
my
guest
was
never
so
high
yet
by
the
laws
of
hospitality
i
was
above
him
whilst
under
my
the
girl
laughed
dashing
away
a
hot
tear
with
the
back
of
a
soapy
hand
trust
you
to
find
a
classic
to
turn
a
tragedy
into
a
comedy
she
said
go
away
now
father
davy
and
i
soon
be
through
it
a
poor
washerwoman
i
am
to
be
thinning
my
suds
with
brine
chapter
ix
a
reasonable
proposition
you
come
too
georgiana
dear
jeannette
furrily
clad
for
a
walk
with
james
stuart
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
back
please
do
come
george
you
need
a
good
tramp
stuart
urged
at
elbow
he
looked
the
picture
of
anticipation
he
had
undertaken
getting
the
visitor
into
training
by
increasingly
long
daily
walks
and
the
result
was
proving
eminently
satisfactory
at
the
end
of
the
first
half
of
the
visit
jeannette
was
looking
wonderfully
well
and
happy
hardly
the
same
girl
who
had
come
to
the
little
village
to
try
if
she
could
endure
such
life
as
was
likely
to
be
offered
her
there
thank
you
my
dears
nothing
could
persuade
me
run
along
and
leave
me
to
diversions
of
my
own
answered
georgiana
gayly
so
they
had
gone
jeannette
wafting
back
a
kiss
stuart
waving
an
enthusiastic
arm
georgiana
had
smiled
at
them
had
closed
the
door
softly
behind
them
and
had
immediately
banged
to
another
conveniently
near
at
hand
one
opening
into
a
small
clothespress
under
the
stair
landing
diversions
of
my
own
she
repeated
with
emphasis
happy
phrase
i
wonder
what
they
think
my
diversions
are
with
this
family
to
look
after
well
you
got
yourself
into
it
george
warne
you
can
stick
it
out
if
it
kills
you
she
deliberately
thumped
one
door
after
another
all
the
way
along
her
progress
through
the
empty
rooms
and
up
the
stairs
to
the
second
floor
her
father
was
away
for
the
afternoon
on
a
rare
visit
to
a
neighbour
who
had
sent
for
him
an
old
parishioner
who
falling
ill
longed
for
the
gentle
offices
of
his
friend
and
minister
as
for
jefferson
this
was
the
time
of
day
when
he
was
always
away
on
his
usual
long
walk
it
was
a
comfort
to
be
alone
in
the
quiet
house
and
to
bang
and
thump
in
her
room
georgiana
arrayed
herself
in
a
heavy
red
sweater
then
ascended
to
the
attic
and
stood
eying
the
great
hand
loom
of
antique
pattern
a
relic
of
an
earlier
century
it
was
equipped
with
a
black
warp
upon
which
a
few
rows
of
woof
had
been
woven
diversions
she
repeated
and
shook
her
round
fist
at
the
lumbering
object
then
she
sat
down
on
the
old
weaver
bench
and
began
to
weave
with
heavy
jarring
thuds
which
shook
the
floor
as
with
strong
arms
she
pulled
and
pushed
and
sent
her
clumsy
shuttle
flying
back
and
forth
the
attic
was
very
cold
but
she
was
soon
warm
with
the
violent
exercise
and
presently
had
discarded
the
sweater
and
was
working
away
with
might
and
main
go
at
it
go
at
it
she
was
saying
to
herself
jealous
idiot
that
you
are
jealous
of
jeannette
of
her
clothes
her
money
her
beauty
her
power
to
attract
jealous
because
jimps
likes
her
so
well
because
father
davy
looks
at
her
with
the
eyes
of
an
appreciative
uncle
because
jefferson
talks
to
her
as
if
he
enjoyed
it
pound
pound
pound
away
at
the
old
loom
till
your
arms
ache
and
see
if
you
can
get
the
nonsense
out
of
you
i
beg
your
pardon
said
a
deep
voice
at
the
top
of
the
narrow
stairs
not
far
away
the
loom
stopped
with
a
jerk
as
the
weaver
flashed
round
upon
the
head
and
shoulders
protruding
above
the
rafters
oh
i
sorry
did
i
disturb
you
cried
georgiana
fire
in
her
voice
she
did
not
look
in
the
least
sorry
i
thought
you
were
out
too
and
i
just
over
your
head
of
course
you
came
up
to
no
i
did
replied
jefferson
he
ascended
two
steps
more
looking
curiously
at
the
loom
i
came
up
because
i
thought
something
extraordinary
had
happened
up
here
and
i
ought
to
find
out
about
it
nothing
extraordinary
merely
something
very
ordinary
i
do
this
whenever
i
have
time
and
the
coast
is
clear
you
usually
go
out
at
this
hour
she
said
accusingly
so
i
do
i
came
back
just
now
when
i
saw
miss
crofton
and
stuart
starting
off
alone
in
hopes
that
you
might
consent
to
go
with
me
a
great
day
wo
you
thank
you
no
the
girl
replied
i
behind
with
my
work
these
rugs
are
orders
very
much
overdue
i
been
rather
delayed
lately
since
my
machine
is
so
noisy
i
ca
work
when
anybody
is
on
the
second
floor
please
never
mind
me
urged
her
visitor
i
can
time
my
work
to
fit
in
with
yours
if
you
need
to
make
haste
but
that
must
be
a
rather
strenuous
business
it
a
very
old
affair
is
it
do
you
mind
if
i
look
at
it
i
never
saw
one
of
just
that
pattern
i
mind
very
much
replied
georgiana
crisply
moving
off
the
bench
and
standing
on
the
floor
but
that
no
reason
why
you
should
examine
the
monster
if
you
like
that
what
i
call
it
i
run
down
and
be
back
when
you
are
through
and
this
she
would
have
done
but
that
he
barred
her
way
but
i
wo
he
said
gravely
if
you
prefer
that
i
should
not
come
back
please
i
intruding
and
i
apologize
and
go
the
light
from
a
dusty
attic
window
fell
full
on
her
face
as
she
stood
and
he
saw
that
in
it
which
made
him
look
again
miss
warne
he
said
gently
something
is
wrong
i
afraid
ca
i
be
of
use
to
you
in
some
way
the
reason
i
wanted
to
look
at
this
loom
was
that
i
saw
your
last
two
strokes
with
the
bar
as
i
came
up
and
i
recognized
what
a
tremendous
push
you
had
to
give
i
something
of
a
mechanic
and
i
wondered
if
i
could
do
a
bit
of
oiling
perhaps
to
make
it
easier
i
afraid
it
tiring
you
unduly
i
need
to
be
tired
she
said
low
but
vehemently
i
in
a
black
mood
and
the
more
i
tire
myself
the
quicker
i
shall
get
the
better
of
it
now
you
know
i
suppose
you
never
have
black
moods
do
i
not
so
black
that
i
could
grind
myself
under
my
own
heel
do
you
have
them
too
i
might
have
known
by
the
look
of
you
you
do
look
as
if
you
ever
had
them
she
said
rather
curiously
her
eyes
on
his
quiet
face
ah
you
ca
always
tell
luckily
it
pretty
cold
up
here
are
you
sure
you
would
do
better
to
take
a
run
in
the
wind
with
me
you
know
somehow
heavy
tasks
look
lighter
after
a
breath
of
outdoor
air
so
you
know
what
heavy
tasks
are
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
resist
the
question
he
looked
steadily
back
at
her
smiling
a
little
his
eyes
were
very
clear
in
their
quiet
scrutiny
she
felt
as
if
he
saw
much
that
she
would
prefer
to
conceal
i
have
known
a
few
that
seemed
to
me
fairly
heavy
at
the
time
he
said
afterward
i
was
thankful
to
have
had
them
to
prepare
me
for
heavier
ones
oh
but
they
were
the
same
dismal
round
were
they
most
tasks
are
but
i
never
had
one
quite
like
this
i
am
concerned
for
you
lest
this
prove
too
heavy
now
that
i
am
here
do
you
really
mind
so
very
much
if
i
look
the
machine
over
she
permitted
it
and
she
did
not
run
away
as
she
had
meant
to
do
presently
he
asked
for
a
and
a
can
of
oil
and
when
she
had
procured
them
he
did
a
number
of
things
to
the
cumbersome
loom
the
result
of
which
when
she
attacked
it
once
more
proved
that
he
had
relieved
to
a
certain
extent
the
hardest
of
her
efforts
but
it
is
still
much
too
severe
for
any
woman
he
said
seriously
standing
oil
can
in
hand
a
little
lock
of
hair
shaken
down
by
his
labours
straying
across
his
forehead
please
tell
me
and
do
think
me
merely
curious
is
there
no
way
in
which
you
can
add
to
your
resources
except
this
you
have
a
college
training
and
no
way
whatever
to
make
use
of
it
she
exclaimed
with
some
bitterness
but
i
can
weave
and
i
have
a
feeling
for
colour
and
form
and
can
work
out
effects
which
find
a
market
rugs
bring
their
price
these
days
really
jefferson
i
am
no
subject
for
pity
and
you
do
want
it
let
me
assure
you
that
i
do
feel
a
particle
to
be
young
and
strong
and
fit
for
hard
work
is
no
cause
for
pity
but
i
have
reason
for
persisting
in
my
inquiry
you
see
i
happen
to
know
of
some
one
in
need
of
such
training
as
you
undoubtedly
have
would
you
consider
giving
a
few
hours
daily
to
one
who
needs
a
copyist
and
critic
georgiana
scanned
his
face
with
intent
incredulous
eyes
then
do
you
mean
yourself
she
questioned
i
mean
myself
i
hesitate
to
mention
that
i
am
the
candidate
knowing
that
that
admission
must
instantly
create
a
prejudice
against
me
he
was
smiling
a
little
but
i
state
an
actual
fact
i
have
reached
a
point
in
my
labours
where
i
need
a
copyist
do
you
think
it
possible
that
i
may
secure
one
without
sending
away
for
her
i
must
suspect
you
she
said
slowly
and
with
rising
colour
of
manufacturing
a
need
it
is
very
very
kind
of
you
jefferson
but
i
think
i
must
continue
to
weave
my
rugs
but
i
am
not
manufacturing
a
need
he
insisted
i
declare
to
you
that
i
have
been
on
the
point
of
consulting
you
for
some
time
if
it
had
not
been
that
your
days
seemed
very
full
with
your
guest
and
your
housewifery
i
should
have
put
it
to
you
before
now
i
am
in
earnest
miss
warne
wo
you
as
a
matter
of
everyday
business
lend
me
your
eyes
and
your
hand
and
your
critical
judgment
if
you
ca
do
it
while
miss
crofton
is
here
may
i
engage
your
spare
time
after
she
goes
please
do
deny
me
he
began
to
descend
the
stairs
i
wo
stay
for
an
answer
he
said
think
it
over
will
you
and
please
do
refuse
until
you
have
consulted
your
father
why
do
you
ask
that
because
i
know
he
will
look
at
it
as
any
man
would
without
unreasonable
prejudice
against
accepting
a
business
proposition
simply
because
it
happens
to
come
from
a
temporary
member
of
the
household
it
takes
a
woman
to
bother
about
that
with
this
straight
shot
he
left
her
laughing
back
at
her
as
he
descended
in
a
way
that
went
far
toward
disarming
her
though
she
would
not
at
once
admit
it
instead
she
went
back
to
her
loom
putting
into
the
next
section
of
weaving
a
quite
unnecessary
amount
of
force
purely
from
tension
of
mind
over
the
possibilities
opened
up
by
this
most
unexpected
offer
there
was
no
denying
that
it
was
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
which
she
had
often
longed
to
do
and
for
which
she
knew
as
he
had
suggested
she
was
more
than
ordinarily
well
fitted
it
was
impossible
as
she
had
said
not
to
suspect
the
lodger
of
creating
a
want
to
fit
her
need
of
earning
money
yet
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
fact
that
any
writer
of
books
who
draws
upon
all
manner
of
collected
notes
and
reference
books
for
his
material
must
be
able
to
make
valuable
use
of
an
assistant
in
a
variety
of
ways
why
should
she
not
take
him
at
his
word
well
she
would
think
of
it
and
meanwhile
suddenly
the
black
mood
was
gone
chapter
x
stuart
objects
that
night
after
jefferson
unexpected
proposal
that
she
should
assist
him
in
his
literary
work
georgiana
running
out
upon
an
errand
in
the
business
part
of
the
village
encountered
james
stuart
this
had
been
a
not
infrequent
happening
in
days
past
but
since
arrival
it
had
not
once
occurred
stuart
was
much
at
the
house
but
not
for
a
fortnight
had
georgiana
had
ten
minutes
alone
with
him
that
he
welcomed
the
chance
as
well
as
she
was
evident
from
his
first
word
great
luck
at
last
i
get
you
to
myself
for
half
a
wink
without
a
soul
around
where
are
you
going
wherever
it
is
you
do
go
back
to
the
house
till
you
given
me
what
i
want
and
what
that
queried
georgiana
her
tone
was
cool
in
spite
of
herself
she
had
missed
the
almost
daily
walks
and
talks
with
stuart
glad
as
she
had
been
to
have
him
do
his
effectual
part
in
helping
her
entertain
her
guests
and
there
had
been
as
she
was
obliged
to
confess
to
herself
a
sense
that
if
he
had
been
very
anxious
not
to
lose
altogether
her
society
he
would
have
managed
in
spite
of
lack
of
ordinary
opportunity
to
bring
about
such
meetings
how
much
she
could
feel
the
absence
of
his
companionship
she
had
not
dreamed
until
she
had
been
tried
after
the
friendly
village
fashion
of
intimate
acquaintance
he
lightly
grasped
her
arm
in
its
covering
of
the
military
cape
she
always
wore
on
such
walks
and
turned
her
from
her
course
toward
a
side
street
leading
away
instead
of
toward
the
centre
she
had
been
approaching
she
protested
but
he
was
laughingly
determined
and
she
yielded
it
was
good
undeniably
good
to
have
jimps
by
her
side
again
and
hear
his
voice
in
his
old
eagerly
devoted
tones
in
her
ear
that
he
was
really
overjoyed
at
coming
upon
her
in
a
free
hour
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
my
word
george
but
you
kept
me
on
short
rations
lately
he
began
accusingly
one
would
think
you
had
suddenly
put
me
on
a
diet
list
nothing
but
sweets
contrary
to
the
usual
prohibitions
of
the
medical
men
for
the
husky
male
do
you
think
i
have
no
appetite
for
the
good
substantial
food
parties
and
drives
and
always
with
the
lovely
guest
and
never
an
hobnob
with
my
chum
what
the
matter
with
you
george
what
have
i
done
but
such
sweets
and
so
soon
they
will
be
gone
and
nothing
for
the
hungry
youth
but
plain
bread
and
butter
how
absurd
of
you
to
complain
bread
and
butter
beefsteak
and
mushrooms
you
mean
roast
turkey
and
cranberry
sauce
a
fellow
can
live
on
them
but
not
on
eternal
honey
and
fudge
with
my
apologies
to
the
lady
i
should
say
so
jimps
you
outrageous
and
you
do
mean
it
i
would
walk
another
step
with
you
if
you
did
she
undoubtedly
the
sweetest
thing
on
earth
admitted
stuart
there
are
times
when
i
think
i
like
to
ask
her
to
marry
me
on
the
spot
if
she
have
me
which
she
would
me
a
farmer
she
dazzles
me
bewitches
me
makes
me
all
but
lose
my
head
and
then
i
look
at
my
chum
the
girl
i
known
all
my
life
and
i
think
well
sugar
is
all
right
but
you
ca
get
on
without
salt
and
pepper
and
ginger
and
jimps
in
spite
of
herself
georgiana
was
laughing
infectiously
and
stuart
joined
her
how
absolutely
ridiculous
i
sound
like
a
whole
spice
box
and
nothing
but
the
spices
at
that
that
what
you
are
declared
james
stuart
contentedly
and
when
with
you
i
have
no
hankering
after
sugar
mustard
plasters
for
me
they
warming
they
walked
on
the
spirit
of
good
fellowship
keeping
step
with
them
if
georgiana
had
allowed
herself
to
believe
that
stuart
was
completely
absorbed
with
the
enchantments
of
the
beautiful
guest
she
now
discovered
that
quite
as
he
had
said
the
enchantment
was
by
no
means
complete
and
he
had
not
lost
appreciation
of
the
old
friendship
and
what
it
meant
to
him
this
was
good
to
feel
it
was
all
she
wanted
if
she
had
been
guilty
of
a
creeping
sense
of
jealousy
as
she
watched
stuart
and
jeannette
together
so
evidently
enjoying
each
other
society
to
the
full
it
was
because
it
made
her
suddenly
and
unpleasantly
understand
what
it
would
be
to
her
to
live
her
days
in
this
commonplace
little
village
without
stuart
at
her
right
hand
but
here
he
was
literally
at
her
right
hand
and
he
was
making
her
walk
with
him
not
a
beggarly
square
or
two
out
of
her
way
but
a
good
three
miles
around
a
certain
course
which
once
entered
upon
could
not
be
cut
short
by
any
crossroads
and
all
the
way
he
was
telling
her
as
he
had
always
done
all
manner
of
intimate
things
about
his
affairs
and
asking
her
of
hers
before
the
circuit
had
been
made
georgiana
had
done
that
which
an
hour
before
she
would
have
thought
far
from
her
intention
natural
as
such
a
procedure
would
have
been
a
month
ago
before
jeannette
came
she
had
told
stuart
of
jefferson
offer
if
the
truth
must
be
confessed
after
suffering
the
mood
which
had
only
lately
been
dissipated
she
could
not
resist
producing
the
effect
she
knew
if
jimps
were
still
jimps
was
bound
to
be
produced
such
is
woman
quite
as
she
had
foreseen
he
was
aroused
on
the
instant
the
generous
sharing
of
georgiana
warne
with
other
aspirants
for
her
favour
had
never
been
one
of
james
stuart
characteristics
though
he
was
in
every
other
way
he
stopped
short
in
the
snowy
path
regarding
her
sternly
while
she
smiled
in
the
darkness
this
was
balm
for
a
heavy
heart
indeed
this
recognition
she
had
of
his
disapproval
even
before
he
jerked
out
the
quick
words
great
scott
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
do
it
spend
hours
every
day
working
with
jefferson
not
a
bit
of
it
not
so
you
notice
it
tell
him
to
go
to
thunder
james
mckenzie
stuart
what
a
tone
to
take
why
on
earth
should
you
object
georgiana
tone
was
rich
and
sweet
and
astonished
it
certainly
sounded
astonished
because
you
my
chum
my
partner
and
i
wo
have
you
going
into
partnership
with
any
other
man
not
much
partnership
secretaries
and
stenographers
are
partners
are
they
though
the
most
intimate
sort
and
a
fellow
like
jefferson
full
of
books
and
literary
lore
he
be
breaking
off
work
half
his
time
to
talk
montaigne
and
samuel
johnson
and
and
bernard
shaw
with
you
and
you
drink
it
all
in
with
those
eyes
of
yours
and
make
him
think
georgiana
uncontrollable
laughter
halted
but
did
not
stop
him
what
his
work
anyhow
writing
a
history
of
art
growled
stuart
marching
on
with
georgiana
beside
him
bursting
into
fresh
mirth
with
every
step
her
heart
was
quite
light
enough
now
no
danger
that
she
had
lost
her
friend
i
no
idea
what
it
is
but
it
certainly
not
that
he
seldom
speaks
of
art
in
any
form
except
literary
art
of
course
i
an
idea
scientific
research
of
some
sort
then
why
is
he
in
a
laboratory
somewhere
boiling
acids
why
he
digging
in
city
libraries
or
hunting
scientific
stuff
over
in
vienna
vienna
the
place
for
him
i
wish
him
there
fast
enough
irritably
continued
this
asperser
of
other
men
vocations
his
research
work
has
undoubtedly
been
done
he
has
pile
upon
pile
of
notebooks
and
papers
on
file
his
handwriting
is
a
fright
probably
what
he
wants
me
for
to
make
it
legible
to
the
printer
let
him
send
for
a
typist
then
that
what
he
needs
if
he
writes
an
illegible
fist
you
ca
typewrite
i
could
learn
if
necessary
i
often
wished
i
could
you
could
learn
yes
you
could
learn
to
come
when
jefferson
whistled
i
no
doubt
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
george
you
need
turn
away
nobody
could
ever
fancy
you
coming
at
any
man
whistle
i
just
seeing
red
that
all
at
the
thought
of
your
going
into
a
thing
like
this
that
bound
to
throw
you
two
into
the
closest
sort
of
relations
that
all
nonsense
jimps
you
behaving
like
a
little
boy
and
you
know
i
ca
afford
to
lose
a
chance
like
this
you
know
how
slow
the
is
you
do
mean
you
still
at
that
of
course
i
am
the
prices
are
very
good
now
and
i
then
you
certainly
ca
lose
them
to
go
into
copying
manuscript
by
hand
stick
to
the
weaving
that
my
advice
jefferson
saw
the
loom
he
thinks
it
too
hard
work
for
me
suggested
georgiana
slyly
this
was
a
telling
shot
for
stuart
had
often
expressed
himself
in
similar
fashion
in
the
past
as
was
to
have
been
expected
her
companion
became
instantly
more
nettled
than
ever
oh
he
does
does
he
he
said
hotly
i
like
to
know
what
affair
it
is
of
his
you
know
well
enough
i
protested
scores
of
times
against
that
weaving
and
now
you
tell
me
to
stick
to
it
he
wheeled
upon
her
his
tone
changed
george
i
know
i
absolutely
unreasonable
of
course
i
do
want
you
pulling
that
thing
i
do
want
you
to
have
to
hustle
for
money
any
sort
of
way
that
the
truth
what
i
do
want
is
to
keep
you
away
from
every
other
earthly
beggar
but
myself
o
james
stuart
how
absurd
that
not
a
brotherly
attitude
at
all
the
role
of
brother
is
always
entirely
satisfying
retorted
stuart
under
his
breath
you
know
well
enough
you
only
to
say
the
word
and
i
jimps
dear
georgiana
voice
was
very
gentle
now
remember
left
all
that
sentimentalizing
behind
it
was
quite
settled
long
ago
that
you
and
i
were
to
be
brother
and
sister
without
end
and
i
know
you
mean
it
as
brotherly
all
this
fuss
about
my
taking
a
bit
of
perfectly
reasonable
employment
for
just
a
little
while
little
while
do
you
know
how
long
he
expects
to
be
at
work
on
that
confounded
book
no
do
you
he
told
me
one
night
when
we
were
smoking
together
that
he
had
given
himself
a
year
to
do
this
work
in
he
came
in
january
this
is
april
do
you
wonder
i
a
bit
upset
at
the
notion
of
my
best
friend
going
into
harness
with
him
for
a
year
stuart
tone
was
grim
georgiana
now
in
wild
spirits
with
the
relief
from
her
fears
and
the
suddenly
opening
prospect
of
a
long
period
of
such
work
as
she
dearly
loved
had
some
ado
to
keep
her
state
of
mind
from
showing
it
follow
she
said
outwardly
sober
that
he
intends
to
spend
that
whole
year
here
he
will
if
he
gets
you
for
a
side
partner
a
man
would
be
a
fool
not
to
that
a
great
tribute
from
a
brother
admitted
georgiana
smiling
to
herself
but
as
far
as
our
lodger
is
concerned
you
need
have
no
fear
of
any
but
the
most
businesslike
relations
even
though
i
worked
beside
him
as
is
quite
improbable
for
a
year
he
not
that
sort
not
what
sort
do
you
fool
yourself
he
human
if
his
mind
is
bent
on
writing
a
book
and
you
are
georgiana
jimps
there
a
path
in
your
brain
that
getting
worn
too
deep
come
let
hurry
home
jeannette
will
wonder
what
become
of
me
let
her
wonder
george
are
you
going
to
do
this
thing
of
course
i
am
no
matter
how
i
feel
about
it
why
jimps
really
do
you
think
you
have
any
right
georgiana
i
love
you
no
jimps
you
do
not
so
much
as
all
that
you
have
a
brotherly
affection
brotherly
affection
does
hurt
this
does
was
stuart
declaration
no
it
does
my
dear
boy
you
just
made
with
a
queer
sort
of
jealous
element
in
your
composition
and
when
something
happens
to
call
it
out
you
think
it
something
quite
different
explained
georgiana
rather
lamely
you
know
perfectly
that
you
and
i
fit
best
as
good
friends
we
should
be
awfully
unhappy
tied
up
together
in
any
way
why
we
settled
that
long
ago
as
i
reminded
you
just
now
it
seems
to
have
come
unsettled
stuart
muttered
then
we
must
settle
it
again
truly
you
mean
everything
to
me
as
a
brother
friend
chum
whichever
you
like
and
i
well
i
should
feel
pretty
badly
to
lose
you
but
i
wish
you
leave
it
there
i
do
fancy
what
you
going
on
to
say
then
i
not
say
it
come
jimps
give
me
your
hand
on
the
old
compact
i
will
on
exactly
one
condition
stuart
stood
still
and
faced
her
in
a
certain
secluded
spot
just
where
the
snowy
path
was
on
the
point
of
turning
into
a
wider
thoroughfare
what
is
it
make
it
a
fair
one
it
is
fair
the
fairest
between
a
man
and
a
woman
it
this
leave
the
clause
out
i
agree
to
any
terms
of
friendship
you
insist
on
if
well
just
leave
me
a
chance
will
you
dear
there
was
a
brief
silence
while
georgiana
considered
she
had
not
expected
this
certainly
not
just
now
when
her
friend
frankly
admitted
the
drawing
power
of
the
winsome
visitor
as
she
had
implied
there
had
been
between
them
in
the
days
of
dawning
maturity
while
they
were
yet
in
school
together
certain
youthfully
tender
vows
which
they
had
later
exchanged
for
the
more
carefully
considered
terms
of
the
warm
but
less
sentimental
friendship
which
had
now
existed
for
some
years
that
stuart
was
really
dearer
to
her
more
a
necessary
part
of
her
life
than
she
had
realized
had
been
made
disconcertingly
clear
to
her
by
the
totally
unexpected
pangs
she
had
suffered
during
the
last
fortnight
when
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
likely
to
lose
the
fine
fervor
of
his
devotion
now
however
that
she
was
assured
of
his
intense
loyalty
she
was
the
old
georgiana
again
ready
to
stand
beside
her
friend
to
the
last
ditch
if
need
be
but
wholly
unwilling
to
bind
herself
to
his
chariot
wheels
while
no
ditches
threatened
is
a
big
word
she
said
finally
it
is
best
to
say
about
anything
in
this
life
then
you
wo
ask
me
to
say
it
his
voice
was
eager
not
if
you
do
want
to
jimps
i
do
there
was
never
anything
surer
than
that
give
me
your
hand
chum
she
gave
it
all
right
chum
he
had
pulled
off
his
own
glove
he
now
gently
drew
off
hers
and
the
two
warm
hands
clasped
here
our
everlasting
friendship
he
said
with
a
little
thrill
in
his
low
voice
nothing
shall
come
between
us
except
love
jimps
that
not
the
old
compact
at
all
it
the
new
one
then
is
it
sufficiently
ambiguous
to
suit
you
it
much
too
ambiguous
i
can
make
it
plainer
perhaps
you
better
leave
it
as
it
is
she
admitted
recognizing
danger
as
you
say
he
held
her
hand
for
a
minute
in
such
a
close
grasp
that
it
hurt
her
but
she
did
not
wince
ah
if
she
might
just
have
this
pleasantly
satisfying
relation
with
the
man
whose
presence
in
her
life
meant
warmth
and
light
and
even
happiness
on
the
hard
road
of
everyday
routine
and
then
have
somehow
besides
the
contentment
which
comes
of
accomplishment
along
a
line
of
chosen
activity
and
still
remain
free
for
whatever
god
in
heaven
might
send
her
of
real
joy
she
could
ask
no
better
jimps
i
perfectly
contented
she
said
radiantly
as
they
walked
on
that
good
i
wish
i
were
what
would
make
you
your
promise
to
earn
your
money
making
rugs
with
me
to
help
you
but
you
could
i
could
learn
oh
how
absurd
you
have
time
if
there
were
no
other
reason
he
did
not
answer
and
since
they
were
now
back
in
the
village
and
nearing
the
object
of
georgiana
errand
no
more
was
said
until
they
were
once
again
on
their
way
homeward
they
walked
in
silence
until
they
reached
the
very
doorstep
of
the
manse
then
stuart
made
one
more
protest
not
even
to
please
me
george
he
asked
as
she
stood
on
the
step
above
him
leading
the
way
in
to
jeannette
and
the
warm
fireside
jimps
i
sorry
you
feel
that
way
about
it
but
i
talked
with
father
davy
and
he
agrees
that
it
a
godsend
there
no
reason
in
the
world
i
could
give
jefferson
for
refusing
to
help
him
when
he
needs
it
and
when
i
need
it
too
therefore
i
sorry
jimps
since
you
are
so
strange
as
to
care
but
i
made
up
my
mind
you
excuse
me
if
i
do
come
in
he
said
and
turned
away
she
stood
looking
comprehendingly
after
him
as
he
left
her
then
ran
in
and
closed
the
door
the
mood
which
held
her
now
was
so
far
from
being
black
that
it
was
rosy
red
chapter
xi
borrowed
plumes
uncle
david
i
was
never
so
sorry
to
come
to
the
end
of
any
visit
as
i
am
this
one
said
jeannette
crofton
she
was
holding
warne
frail
hand
in
both
her
own
and
looking
straight
into
the
young
eyes
which
looked
affectionately
back
at
her
she
was
dressed
for
her
departure
and
the
great
closed
town
car
which
had
brought
her
was
waiting
at
the
door
near
her
stood
georgiana
and
james
mckenzie
stuart
jefferson
had
just
appeared
in
the
background
come
to
bid
the
guest
farewell
you
have
given
us
much
pleasure
my
dear
responded
warne
and
if
you
have
received
it
as
well
the
balance
is
pretty
evenly
struck
i
might
have
stayed
two
days
longer
declared
jeannette
with
evident
longing
if
it
had
been
for
that
sister
of
mine
i
sure
she
could
have
had
a
birthday
dance
without
me
but
no
how
i
wish
i
were
taking
you
all
with
me
even
you
jefferson
she
added
with
one
of
her
adorable
smiles
as
she
turned
to
him
you
whom
i
ca
possibly
imagine
caring
to
dance
a
step
not
even
with
the
prettiest
girl
i
could
find
for
you
you
almost
make
me
wish
i
knew
how
to
dance
a
step
said
jefferson
advancing
to
take
her
hand
as
it
is
i
can
at
least
wish
that
prettiest
girl
a
partner
worthy
of
her
grace
while
i
am
wishing
exclaimed
jeannette
with
characteristic
impulsiveness
why
in
the
world
do
i
bring
about
my
own
wishes
oh
where
have
my
wits
been
georgiana
darling
run
and
dress
and
go
with
me
i
send
you
back
in
the
car
and
you
too
stuart
oh
come
both
of
you
and
dance
at
rosalie
birthday
fête
please
please
do
she
turned
to
warne
may
she
uncle
david
could
you
manage
to
spare
her
just
for
hours
they
looked
at
one
another
smiling
hardly
believing
that
the
gay
suggestion
was
a
serious
one
but
by
jeannette
accustomed
to
having
her
own
way
once
a
way
had
occurred
to
her
all
objections
were
thrust
aside
oh
but
you
must
come
she
cried
i
not
take
no
come
and
talk
it
over
a
minute
with
me
crazy
child
bade
georgiana
and
she
drew
her
cousin
out
of
the
room
where
she
could
state
the
great
difficulty
which
being
a
woman
had
instantly
assailed
her
jean
i
hate
to
quash
such
a
glorious
idea
but
i
shall
have
to
be
frank
clothes
with
loads
of
frocks
hanging
in
my
wardrobe
at
home
and
half
of
them
too
trying
for
me
to
wear
at
all
while
they
would
suit
you
perfectly
nonsense
oh
hurry
and
make
ready
james
stuart
will
go
if
you
will
i
saw
it
in
his
eyes
it
could
not
be
refused
this
tempting
invitation
with
such
a
lovely
tyrant
to
enforce
her
will
one
word
however
did
james
stuart
and
georgiana
warne
exchange
in
a
corner
before
they
capitulated
george
my
evening
togs
they
been
put
away
for
the
four
years
since
i
left
college
they
must
be
about
the
most
hopelessly
ancient
cut
conceivable
to
eyes
like
hers
shall
i
risk
looking
like
a
rustic
in
such
a
house
as
that
but
stuart
eyes
were
eager
as
a
boy
i
not
go
if
you
wo
jimps
as
for
rusticity
i
can
keep
you
company
can
you
bear
to
lose
such
a
frolic
i
ca
neither
can
i
hang
it
all
right
i
be
a
sport
if
you
will
agreed
stuart
with
a
laugh
and
rushed
away
to
pack
a
bag
in
short
order
all
the
zest
of
irrepressible
youth
in
one
who
had
been
forced
by
circumstance
to
foreswear
most
of
the
joys
of
youth
for
stern
labour
coming
uppermost
to
bid
him
make
merry
once
more
at
any
cost
of
after
fall
of
spirits
thank
goodness
i
had
the
sense
always
to
keep
the
latest
of
jeannette
tailored
suits
pressed
and
trim
thought
georgiana
as
she
dressed
this
is
a
year
behind
the
extreme
style
but
i
know
perfectly
well
i
look
absolutely
all
right
in
it
and
my
hat
having
once
been
hers
is
mighty
becoming
and
smart
if
it
is
a
it
lucky
i
can
do
those
things
that
one
benefit
of
going
to
college
anyhow
a
few
other
in
the
way
of
dress
accessories
all
of
exquisite
material
on
account
of
their
source
and
daintily
preserved
because
of
their
frailty
after
having
served
two
owners
went
into
her
traveling
bag
for
the
dance
itself
since
there
was
no
other
way
she
was
not
loath
to
accept
jeannette
generous
offer
and
being
a
very
human
creature
could
not
help
looking
forward
with
delight
to
the
prospect
of
finding
herself
arrayed
in
such
apparel
as
would
successfully
sustain
any
scrutiny
which
might
be
brought
to
bear
upon
the
country
cousin
as
for
stuart
she
had
no
fears
for
him
for
his
years
of
college
life
had
made
him
an
acceptable
figure
upon
any
occasion
and
she
was
confident
his
broad
shoulders
and
fine
carriage
could
atone
for
any
slightly
antique
cut
of
lapel
or
altogether
it
was
a
very
happy
young
person
who
embraced
david
warne
shook
hands
with
jefferson
and
ran
down
the
path
to
the
great
car
in
the
wake
of
jeannette
and
followed
by
james
stuart
looking
extremely
personable
clothes
were
the
one
extravagance
stuart
allowed
himself
now
that
he
was
immured
for
at
least
the
early
half
of
his
life
as
he
expected
upon
the
farm
of
his
inheritance
well
well
i
glad
to
have
my
little
girl
run
away
for
a
few
hours
said
father
davy
from
the
window
where
with
jefferson
at
his
shoulder
he
stood
watching
for
the
final
wave
of
georgiana
hand
she
has
enjoyed
her
cousin
visit
but
it
has
meant
considerable
extra
labour
for
her
this
seems
a
fitting
return
for
jeannette
to
make
one
can
hardly
blame
miss
crofton
for
wanting
to
prolong
her
enjoyment
of
your
daughter
society
observed
jefferson
his
eyes
watching
closely
the
laughing
faces
behind
the
glass
as
the
travelers
settled
themselves
i
can
imagine
one
feeling
a
very
decided
emptiness
in
a
place
which
she
had
left
there
they
off
announced
warne
waving
his
slender
arm
with
eagerness
his
delicate
features
alight
with
pleasure
in
this
unexpected
happening
emptiness
you
say
jefferson
he
added
as
the
two
turned
away
with
the
car
out
of
sight
down
the
snowy
road
that
quite
expresses
it
even
for
a
few
hours
i
am
conscious
of
a
distinct
sense
of
loneliness
without
georgiana
her
personality
is
one
which
makes
itself
felt
it
has
individuality
audacity
even
i
think
that
curious
quality
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
we
call
am
i
too
prejudiced
he
placed
himself
upon
his
couch
plainly
very
weary
with
the
flurry
of
the
last
hour
he
lay
looking
up
at
jefferson
who
had
lingered
a
little
before
going
back
to
the
work
which
loudly
called
to
him
it
was
quite
possible
for
the
younger
man
to
comprehend
how
desolate
was
the
gentle
invalid
feeling
at
being
left
if
only
for
a
day
and
a
night
in
the
care
of
the
friendly
neighbour
who
was
to
minister
to
his
needs
and
who
was
already
to
be
heard
bustling
about
the
laying
the
table
for
the
coming
meal
you
may
be
prejudiced
admitted
his
companion
but
it
is
a
prejudice
which
can
be
readily
forgiven
and
even
shared
he
added
smiling
her
cousin
pursued
warne
slowly
would
outshine
her
in
beauty
and
in
sweetness
of
disposition
perhaps
though
i
doubt
if
jeannette
has
ever
had
a
fraction
of
the
tests
of
character
and
endurance
my
girl
has
had
she
surely
never
has
agreed
the
other
and
as
for
mere
sweetness
of
disposition
there
are
other
qualities
which
make
their
own
appeal
a
whimsical
smile
appeared
upon
the
pale
face
resting
against
one
of
georgiana
crimson
couch
pillows
how
she
would
make
me
signals
of
distress
and
warning
he
mused
if
she
could
hear
me
carrying
on
an
antiphonal
service
in
her
praise
with
our
lodger
who
she
would
consider
knows
her
not
at
all
well
well
she
is
mine
own
and
i
as
rich
in
having
such
a
jewel
as
twenty
seas
if
all
their
sand
were
pearl
the
water
nectar
and
the
rocks
pure

you
forgive
an
old
man
romanticism
jefferson
i
hope
you
are
one
of
the
youngest
men
i
know
and
if
you
may
quote
shakespeare
to
your
purpose
i
may
quote
good
old
doctor
holmes
said
jefferson
drawing
the
pillow
into
an
easier
position
as
he
spoke
doth
not
lack
an
almanac
whose
youth
is
in
his
soul
to
georgiana
warne
a
year
out
of
college
and
during
that
year
having
sorely
missed
the
many
gayeties
of
the
life
she
had
known
for
four
happy
years
the
present
experience
was
delightful
she
enjoyed
every
minute
of
the
swift
drive
over
the
sixty
miles
to
her
cousin
home
enjoyed
the
arrival
there
the
meeting
with
the
family
and
their
house
guests
assembled
for
afternoon
tea
the
installment
in
a
luxuriously
furnished
room
where
jeannette
presently
brought
her
an
armful
of
gowns
to
choose
from
for
the
evening
a
small
dinner
was
to
precede
the
dance
and
all
sorts
of
scheming
for
georgiana
pleasure
had
been
fermenting
in
jeannette
brain
on
the
way
home
i
arranged
with
rosalie
to
put
you
next
her
special
prize
the
most
wonderful
man
she
knows
all
her
set
are
crazy
over
him
though
he
belongs
in
ours
fast
enough
it
miles
channing
just
home
after
a
year
travel
and
as
good
looking
as
any
illustrator
ever
drew
you
see
you
simply
must
be
your
most
brilliant
self
and
here
the
way
to
do
it
wear
this
she
held
up
before
georgiana
disconcerted
gaze
such
a
marvel
of
colour
and
cunning
as
brought
a
gasp
of
astonishment
and
a
quick
denial
oh
my
dear
not
that
for
me
it
bad
enough
to
wear
your
things
at
all
but
do
give
me
something
that
will
make
everybody
look
at
me
like
that
that
precisely
what
i
want
laughed
jeannette
and
this
is
a
thing
i
have
ventured
to
wear
and
never
shall
though
i
wild
to
do
it
but
i
could
carry
it
off
you
can
those
orange
shades
will
be
glorious
with
your
eyes
and
hair
besides
as
for
making
you
conspicuous
above
the
rest
on
account
of
any
gorgeousness
of
colour
or
eccentricity
of
style
it
simply
ca
be
done
these
days
so
put
this
on
and
see
for
yourself
you
need
wear
it
of
course
if
you
do
like
it
but
you
will
reluctantly
georgiana
allowed
a
slim
french
maid
to
slip
the
marvel
of
her
country
art
over
the
bared
shoulders
and
the
next
minute
she
was
staring
at
herself
in
a
long
mirror
while
susette
clasped
her
hands
and
gay
young
rosalie
passing
the
door
at
the
moment
and
summoned
to
the
private
view
cried
joyously
oh
georgiana
you
perfectly
stunning
of
course
you
must
wear
it
and
you
be
the
star
of
the
evening
rosalie
rushed
on
having
settled
the
questions
out
of
hand
after
the
manner
of
the
youthful
jeannette
was
laughing
as
she
called
her
mother
in
to
confirm
the
decision
crofton
languidly
interested
surveyed
her
niece
with
approval
she
was
an
impressive
lady
was
aunt
olivia
and
was
accustomed
to
have
her
opinion
carry
weight
it
suits
you
my
dear
was
her
verdict
those
who
can
wear
such
daring
effects
should
do
it
for
every
scene
needs
points
of
light
and
intensity
and
these
other
frocks
jeannette
declared
pointing
to
them
where
susette
had
spread
them
out
upon
the
bed
are
just
colourless
baby
things
that
anybody
can
wear
they
look
exquisite
to
me
regretted
georgiana
eying
them
wistfully
somehow
now
that
she
was
here
she
did
not
so
much
enjoy
the
thought
of
appearing
in
borrowed
finery
and
since
it
must
be
done
would
have
preferred
the
simplest
white
frock
in
jeannette
wardrobe
but
this
was
not
to
be
without
displeasing
her
hostesses
and
she
reluctantly
submitted
susette
begged
leave
to
arrange
her
hair
jeannette
hunted
out
silk
stockings
and
slippers
to
match
the
frock
and
rosalie
contributed
the
long
white
gloves
which
completed
the
costuming
when
georgiana
was
ready
to
descend
she
took
one
last
look
at
the
girl
in
the
long
mirror
and
turned
to
jeannette
herself
a
picture
in
the
delicate
colourings
which
she
affected
and
which
set
off
her
golden
beauty
i
feel
like
the
old
woman
in
the
nursery
song
she
said
doubtful
of
my
identity
but
you
must
admit
you
simply
glorious
cried
jeannette
i
knew
you
were
a
beauty
but
i
did
know
you
were
such
a
raving
one
as
this
i
no
beauty
denied
georgiana
with
spirit
it
just
the
clothes
but
you
i
never
saw
anything
so
enchanting
as
you
delightful
i
so
glad
for
there
somebody
i
want
to
enchant
come
on
and
jeannette
led
the
way
at
the
foot
of
the
great
staircase
about
a
wide
fireplace
georgiana
saw
james
stuart
with
a
group
of
other
young
men
and
noted
swiftly
that
there
was
no
contrast
to
be
noted
between
her
friend
and
his
faultlessly
attired
companions
except
that
his
face
and
hands
wore
a
deeper
coat
of
winter
tan
than
theirs
and
he
looked
stronger
and
more
virile
than
any
of
them
and
even
in
his
outdoor
colouring
there
was
among
them
one
who
rivalled
him
the
one
who
as
georgiana
instantly
guessed
was
the
lately
arrived
traveler
a
moment
later
she
met
stuart
eyes
and
saw
his
look
of
astonishment
as
he
gazed
at
her
presently
when
those
whom
she
had
not
already
met
had
been
made
known
to
her
she
found
stuart
at
her
elbow
am
i
dreaming
said
his
voice
in
her
ear
or
is
this
my
chum
i
almost
afraid
to
speak
to
you
you
look
awfully
nice
jimps
she
returned
under
her
breath
yes
is
it
absurd
for
me
to
be
peacocking
like
this
but
they
made
me
do
it
you
take
my
breath
away
look
at
jean
she
whispered
is
she
the
loveliest
thing
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
he
looked
you
and
she
are
a
pair
he
admitted
jeannette
came
up
to
them
with
the
tall
traveler
and
georgiana
found
herself
looking
up
into
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
whose
glance
told
her
that
their
owner
found
her
worth
studying
intently
miles
channing
was
of
the
sort
who
waste
no
time
in
preliminaries
by
the
time
she
had
sat
out
half
the
dinner
by
his
side
she
felt
as
if
she
had
been
under
fire
for
hours
all
her
youth
and
wit
responded
to
his
sallies
and
she
enjoyed
the
encounter
as
keenly
as
a
girl
might
be
expected
to
do
who
for
a
year
had
seen
no
men
but
the
slow
village
swains
always
excepting
james
stuart
who
was
her
one
reliance
in
time
of
famine
channing
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
his
preoccupation
with
the
most
attractive
of
the
few
strangers
in
the
set
of
young
people
whom
he
had
known
for
years
between
the
dinner
and
the
dance
jeannette
who
had
been
observing
without
seeming
to
observe
dropped
a
word
in
ear
you
done
it
dear
i
never
saw
him
lose
his
head
so
completely
you
have
to
be
careful
or
you
have
all
the
girls
down
on
you
they
crazy
over
him
you
know
including
rosalie
absurd
i
shall
never
see
him
again
so
what
does
it
matter
retorted
georgiana
do
be
too
sure
of
that
nothing
can
stop
him
when
he
interested
and
you
know
you
are
a
witch
anybody
would
be
caught
in
your
snare
i
did
know
you
were
such
a
clever
thing
at
the
game
though
i
might
have
guessed
it
if
i
were
i
might
take
lessons
of
you
georgiana
gave
back
you
have
jimps
slightly
delirious
i
can
see
is
he
the
one
you
wanted
to
enchant
i
sure
you
done
it
is
he
splendid
he
looks
so
much
stronger
and
more
interesting
than
half
these
boys
i
known
all
my
life
i
do
want
him
to
have
a
good
time
he
having
it
georgiana
was
sure
of
this
but
she
was
having
so
good
a
time
herself
she
did
mind
more
than
once
she
had
caught
stuart
eyes
across
the
table
and
had
noted
how
they
were
sparkling
the
glance
the
two
exchanged
might
have
been
interpreted
to
mean
fun
is
it
you
play
up
to
your
opportunities
and
so
will
i
this
wo
happen
again
in
our
lives
perhaps
presently
the
dancing
began
in
great
rooms
cleared
for
the
purpose
and
decorated
with
every
art
of
the
florist
the
music
was
all
of
a
quality
more
perfect
than
any
georgiana
had
ever
heard
and
the
strains
which
assailed
her
ears
made
her
wild
to
dance
to
every
note
she
was
besieged
by
invitations
but
i
have
danced
for
more
than
a
year
and
i
do
know
one
of
the
latest
steps
she
said
regretfully
we
soon
remedy
that
promised
chester
crofton
her
cousin
who
carried
her
off
into
an
unoccupied
room
where
the
music
could
yet
be
heard
and
proceeded
to
teach
her
she
was
easily
taught
having
all
the
foundations
after
four
years
of
practice
among
college
girls
and
she
was
soon
able
to
go
upon
the
floor
with
young
crofton
and
the
rest
miles
channing
did
not
dance
but
after
watching
for
a
time
while
georgiana
was
acutely
conscious
that
his
eyes
constantly
followed
her
he
claimed
and
bore
her
off
before
others
could
prevent
in
a
corner
well
removed
from
observation
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
content
and
settled
down
beside
her
i
hope
you
will
not
be
too
much
bored
at
missing
a
round
or
two
he
began
in
the
slightly
drawling
speech
which
was
somehow
one
of
his
charms
it
was
so
curiously
accompanied
by
his
intent
observation
i
have
danced
for
so
long
i
ca
venture
to
attempt
it
especially
with
you
i
should
be
the
most
patient
of
partners
i
so
unaccomplished
myself
declared
georgiana
nevertheless
i
should
want
to
try
you
you
dance
like
a
sylph
i
like
an
elephant
i
do
believe
it
you
do
grudge
sitting
out
then
do
you
he
asked
not
a
bit
it
would
really
matter
if
you
did
for
i
intend
to
hold
my
advantage
now
i
have
it
i
care
more
to
talk
with
you
than
for
all
the
dances
on
the
program
and
the
time
is
so
short
i
must
make
the
most
of
it
you
go
back
i
understand
yes
indeed
and
you
not
be
here
soon
again
i
do
expect
to
i
a
very
busy
person
at
home
and
can
seldom
be
spared
that
means
that
whoever
wants
to
know
you
must
come
to
your
home
georgiana
felt
her
pulse
beats
quickening
this
was
certainly
losing
no
time
she
assented
to
the
interrogation
explaining
that
her
father
was
an
invalid
and
she
was
his
housekeeper
she
felt
no
temptation
to
represent
things
to
channing
as
other
than
they
were
it
was
somehow
an
atonement
for
appearing
in
her
borrowed
attire
that
she
should
not
allow
appearances
to
deceive
this
new
acquaintance
into
thinking
her
home
the
counterpart
of
her
cousin
the
news
did
not
appear
in
the
least
to
disconcert
him
i
should
like
very
much
to
meet
your
father
channing
said
and
georgiana
liked
him
for
taking
the
trouble
to
put
it
in
that
way
he
instantly
added
and
i
should
like
still
more
to
see
you
in
your
own
home
may
i
have
that
pleasure
we
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
you
she
promised
careful
of
her
manner
no
matter
how
soon
i
come
i
suppose
you
will
allow
me
to
reach
home
first
she
questioned
gayly
barely
this
is
wednesday
night
you
go
home
thursday
may
i
come
saturday
you
have
been
living
on
railway
schedules
so
long
you
have
acquired
the
habit
she
gave
back
with
slightly
heightened
colour
in
the
course
of
her
experience
she
had
seen
more
than
one
young
man
change
his
plans
after
encountering
her
but
she
had
never
known
one
to
form
new
ones
as
quickly
as
this
i
have
discovered
that
when
one
wants
to
reach
a
place
very
much
he
ca
start
too
soon
he
said
very
low
with
such
obvious
meaning
that
she
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
her
cool
composure
it
was
not
only
his
words
but
his
looks
and
manner
which
spoke
she
had
never
dreamed
that
outside
of
stories
men
ever
really
did
begin
to
fire
on
sight
like
this
the
matter
settled
channing
began
to
talk
of
other
things
but
through
all
his
speech
and
acts
ran
the
visible
thread
of
his
instant
and
powerful
attraction
to
her
so
that
she
was
conscious
of
the
colour
of
it
by
the
time
two
dances
had
gone
by
and
she
was
sought
and
found
by
an
eager
claimant
the
girl
was
quite
ready
to
get
away
from
this
new
and
decidedly
disturbing
experience
and
when
a
little
later
she
allowed
james
stuart
to
try
one
of
the
new
steps
with
her
she
had
a
comfortable
sense
of
having
got
back
upon
known
and
solid
ground
after
having
been
swimming
in
a
current
chapter
xii
early
morning
you
no
idea
jimpsy
georgiana
said
when
she
and
james
stuart
had
assured
themselves
that
they
were
able
to
suit
their
steps
to
each
other
and
were
moving
smoothly
down
the
floor
how
glad
i
am
to
be
with
some
one
i
know
for
a
bit
only
some
one
not
particularly
me
yes
particularly
you
my
brain
needs
a
little
rest
there
a
compliment
for
an
old
friend
but
i
did
suppose
dancing
tired
the
brain
it
my
feet
that
have
bothered
me
i
walked
all
over
jeannette
little
toes
but
she
perfectly
game
and
wo
admit
it
i
thought
you
and
she
were
getting
on
beautifully
together
so
we
were
i
could
see
how
you
and
channing
got
on
together
because
you
went
off
and
hid
somewhere
that
not
fair
with
a
perfectly
new
acquaintance
did
you
and
jeannette
go
off
and
hide
somewhere
we
not
new
acquaintances
oh
indeed
how
old
ones
are
you
a
month
is
a
long
time
compared
with
one
short
evening
i
never
knew
george
you
were
such
a
terrific
charmer
you
had
them
all
nailed
and
as
for
channing
well
only
i
suppose
he
a
shark
at
the
game
himself
he
shows
it
better
look
out
what
an
excellent
opportunity
a
dance
is
for
old
friends
to
give
each
other
good
advice
georgiana
smiled
up
into
his
eyes
he
closed
his
own
for
an
instant
do
do
that
it
dazzles
me
nonsense
you
learning
the
game
yourself
jeannette
been
teaching
you
we
all
finding
each
other
out
i
had
no
idea
she
could
sparkle
so
you
the
sparkler
she
simply
glows
with
a
steady
light
well
i
like
that
you
like
everything
you
remind
me
of
a
peach
on
fire
jimps
georgiana
soft
laughter
assailed
his
ear
i
believe
both
a
bit
crazy
with
this
sudden
leap
into
dissipation
such
dissipation
just
remember
where
we
be
night
i
do
want
to
except
that
i
be
with
you
we
talk
it
all
over
by
your
fire
eh
of
course
there
be
that
much
left
anyhow
is
this
over
thank
you
jimps
for
the
best
dance
i
had
no
use
trying
it
on
me
he
murmured
as
he
released
her
what
the
use
of
capturing
what
you
already
got
by
and
by
it
was
all
over
and
georgiana
was
mounting
the
stairs
with
jeannette
smiling
back
at
certain
faces
in
the
disordered
spaces
below
where
flowers
lay
about
the
floors
and
a
group
of
young
fellows
belonging
to
rosalie
house
party
were
making
merry
before
they
broke
ranks
in
jeannette
room
by
a
blazing
fire
the
girls
held
brief
session
sitting
with
unbound
hair
and
swinging
slippered
feet
and
cheeks
still
flushed
with
the
night
gayety
jimps
and
i
were
imagining
ourselves
sitting
by
the
fire
in
our
old
night
said
georgiana
softly
staring
into
the
flame
with
eyes
which
reflected
little
points
of
light
it
will
seem
like
a
dream
then
but
we
shall
talk
it
all
over
and
remember
what
fun
we
had
and
how
lovely
everybody
was
to
us
and
how
beautiful
you
were
in
that
frock
you
dear
thing
you
ought
to
have
such
times
often
and
often
cried
jeannette
but
o
georgiana
you
have
times
i
envy
you
while
you
are
dreaming
of
our
flowers
and
music
i
shall
be
dreaming
of
the
dear
old
house
and
the
jolly
evenings
you
gave
me
there
and
envying
you
oh
envying
you
envying
me
are
you
crazy
child
or
are
you
just
just
speaking
the
truth
you
ca
think
how
many
times
i
shall
think
of
you
sitting
there
with
your
three
splendid
men
jean
what
are
you
talking
about
about
uncle
david
and
jimps
and
jefferson
but
they
not
mine
protested
georgiana
laughing
except
father
davy
not
jimps
oh
of
course
he
my
friend
my
very
good
friend
and
only
a
she
made
a
little
grimace
at
the
word
you
speak
as
if
i
had
them
all
about
me
all
the
time
but
you
do
evenings
do
you
they
were
there
much
more
while
you
were
visiting
me
than
they
will
be
now
jimps
has
heaps
of
arrears
to
make
up
he
let
lots
of
work
go
while
you
were
there
you
must
know
my
dear
as
for
jefferson
he
may
never
come
down
any
more
now
that
jimps
wo
be
going
up
to
beg
him
to
make
a
fourth
for
your
entertainment
so
do
imagine
me
holding
court
with
those
three
retainers
it
will
mostly
be
just
father
davy
and
i
with
a
volume
of
dumas
or
kipling
is
it
odd
how
my
pale
little
father
loves
the
red
blood
of
literature
just
the
same
but
jeannette
did
not
finish
that
she
began
afresh
and
oh
how
i
shall
miss
you
george
as
jimps
calls
you
somehow
i
must
have
you
before
long
for
a
real
visit
here
or
wherever
i
may
be
for
the
summer
thank
you
jean
but
i
can
never
get
away
i
arrange
it
somehow
that
makes
me
think
miles
channing
was
dreadfully
disappointed
that
you
were
going
in
the
morning
i
no
doubt
he
will
manage
to
see
you
off
somehow
i
think
it
too
bad
of
you
to
insist
on
going
before
luncheon
think
how
little
sleep
you
have
she
gave
georgiana
a
penetrating
look
as
she
said
it
but
saw
only
a
pair
of
beautiful
bare
arms
thrown
up
over
a
mass
of
dark
locks
as
her
cousin
with
a
clever
imitation
of
a
yawn
answered
merrily
then
we
must
go
to
bed
this
minute
or
i
shall
never
have
strength
of
mind
to
get
up
and
i
ca
leave
father
davy
to
the
tender
mercies
of
perkins
longer
than
i
can
help
she
give
him
everything
that
is
bad
for
him
in
spite
of
the
best
intentions
it
was
a
georgiana
nevertheless
who
fully
dressed
for
the
drive
leaned
over
jeannette
bed
at
ten
that
morning
and
kissed
a
warm
velvet
cheek
murmuring
do
wake
up
jean
we
just
off
after
breakfast
i
write
soon
you
been
a
perfect
darling
and
i
more
grateful
than
i
can
tell
you
oh
i
dead
to
the
world
i
so
tired
moaned
the
girl
in
the
bed
i
always
have
to
pay
up
so
for
dancing
all
night
but
you
she
lifted
languid
eyelids
to
see
her
cousin
smiling
freshness
of
face
and
air
of
vigour
why
you
look
as
though
you
had
had
twelve
hours
sleep
and
a
cold
plunge
i
had
the
cold
plunge
admitted
georgiana
laughing
and
i
as
a
fiddle
as
jimps
says
he
sent
his
to
you
and
told
me
to
tell
you
he
never
forget
you
never
tell
him
i
not
let
him
forget
me
or
you
either
oh
how
i
hate
to
have
you
go
both
of
you
through
a
silent
sleeping
house
georgiana
and
stuart
stole
the
only
member
of
the
family
up
to
see
them
off
being
thomas
crofton
himself
the
oldest
person
under
the
great
rooftree
my
dear
you
must
come
again
you
must
come
often
he
urged
holding
georgiana
hand
and
patting
it
with
a
paternal
air
he
was
a
handsome
man
in
the
early
sixties
with
graying
hair
and
tired
eyes
you
have
done
a
great
deal
for
our
jean
she
looks
much
stronger
than
when
she
went
to
your
home
but
neither
she
nor
rosalie
can
enter
the
race
with
you
for
splendid
health
that
comes
from
your
country
life
i
suppose
i
envy
you
i
envy
you
my
dear
come
and
see
us
uncle
thomas
do
father
davy
would
be
so
happy
you
know
he
such
an
invalid
but
his
mind
and
heart
are
as
young
as
ever
i
will
come
i
will
drive
down
some
day
thank
you
georgiana
i
should
like
to
see
david
again
stuart
come
again
come
again
sorry
your
aunt
was
too
much
done
up
to
see
you
off
this
morning
my
dear
as
the
two
emerged
from
the
door
a
tall
figure
sprang
up
the
steps
what
luck
i
was
passing
and
i
suspected
you
were
just
getting
off
good
morning
can
you
possibly
be
the
girl
i
saw
dancing
seven
hours
ago
i
do
wonder
you
ask
channing
laughed
georgiana
evening
frocks
and
traveling
clothes
are
quite
different
affairs
ah
but
the
traveling
clothes
are
even
the
nicer
of
the
two
when
their
wearer
looks
channing
glanced
at
stuart
standing
by
confound
you
sir
said
he
with
a
genial
grin
shaking
hands
since
you
going
to
drive
all
the
way
home
with
miss
warne
ca
you
give
me
the
chance
to
say
something
pleasant
to
her
you
ca
make
it
too
strong
to
suit
me
observed
stuart
and
remained
within
hearing
saturday
then
if
i
may
said
channing
looking
as
far
into
georgiana
eyes
as
he
could
see
which
was
not
very
far
she
wore
a
close
little
veil
which
interfered
with
her
eyelashes
and
clearly
she
could
not
lift
her
glance
very
high
then
they
were
off
with
channing
waving
farewell
his
hat
high
in
air
a
hand
at
another
window
also
waved
and
georgiana
knew
jeannette
had
seen
this
last
encounter
well
for
sixteen
hours
work
remarked
james
stuart
grimly
as
the
car
gathered
headway
and
the
house
was
left
behind
i
should
say
you
had
done
some
fairly
deadly
execution
saturday
eh
why
does
he
delay
so
long
is
friday
and
a
day
sooner
chapter
xiii
a
copyist
the
old
study
of
david
warne
was
a
square
austerely
furnished
room
on
the
second
floor
of
the
manse
opposite
the
now
occupied
by
jefferson
it
contained
several
plain
bookcases
filled
mostly
with
worn
old
volumes
in
dingy
yellow
calf
or
faded
cloth
an
ancient
table
served
for
a
desk
with
a
chair
before
it
on
the
walls
hung
several
portrait
engravings
that
of
abraham
lincoln
occupying
the
post
of
honour
among
them
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
rag
carpet
of
pleasantly
dimmed
colours
and
an
old
franklin
stove
with
widely
opening
doors
and
a
hearth
with
a
brass
rail
completed
the
furnishing
of
the
room
this
was
the
place
now
swept
and
dusted
and
warmed
for
the
joint
labours
of
the
writer
of
books
and
his
new
assistant
jefferson
had
moved
the
materials
of
his
craft
to
the
new
working
quarters
he
had
brought
up
wood
for
the
fire
and
had
made
that
fire
himself
according
to
the
custom
he
had
inaugurated
soon
after
his
arrival
the
day
and
hour
for
the
beginning
of
that
which
james
stuart
insisted
on
designating
as
a
partnership
had
arrived
at
ten
that
april
morning
when
georgiana
housework
should
have
reached
a
stage
when
she
could
safely
leave
it
for
a
more
or
less
extended
period
the
study
door
was
to
close
upon
the
two
and
shut
them
away
undisturbed
for
the
first
details
of
their
affair
in
common
georgiana
had
been
up
since
before
daybreak
planning
and
executing
a
system
which
should
make
all
this
possible
now
at
a
quarter
before
ten
with
all
well
in
hand
she
flew
to
her
room
for
certain
personal
touches
which
should
transform
her
from
housewife
to
secretary
two
minutes
before
the
clock
struck
she
surveyed
herself
hurriedly
in
her
small
mirror
you
really
look
very
trim
and
demure
she
remarked
to
her
image
your
colour
is
a
bit
high
but
that
exercise
not
excitement
still
you
are
a
little
excited
you
know
my
dear
and
you
must
be
very
careful
not
to
show
it
it
a
calm
cool
business
person
the
gentleman
wants
george
not
a
blushing
schoolgirl
it
would
spoil
it
at
once
if
you
should
look
conscious
or
coquettish
so
now
remember
and
forget
for
the
love
of
your
new
occupation
forget
that
miles
channing
is
coming
again
again
after
one
short
week
what
does
it
matter
if
he
is
run
along
and
be
good
half
a
minute
left
in
which
to
run
downstairs
kiss
father
davy
on
his
white
forehead
and
receive
his
warm
bless
you
dear
and
bless
the
new
work
may
you
be
very
happy
in
it
and
to
walk
quietly
upstairs
again
and
knock
at
the
door
of
the
study
it
opened
under
hand
and
to
the
cheerful
sound
of
snapping
wood
on
the
open
hearth
of
the
old
franklin
stove
he
bade
her
enter
his
smile
was
very
pleasant
his
steady
eyes
seemed
to
take
note
of
everything
about
her
in
one
quick
glance
as
he
said
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
welcome
to
my
workshop
you
see
i
swept
up
all
the
chips
but
we
soon
make
more
you
manage
to
keep
your
workshop
remarkably
free
from
chips
she
commented
you
must
have
a
great
system
of
order
pretty
fair
i
should
be
hopelessly
lost
if
i
let
this
mass
of
material
become
disordered
will
you
take
this
chair
must
we
begin
at
once
or
may
we
talk
a
little
first
i
think
we
had
better
begin
you
know
there
are
just
two
free
hours
before
i
must
be
back
downstairs
if
you
are
to
eat
this
noon
he
laughed
and
she
noted
as
she
had
noted
many
times
before
how
young
he
looked
at
such
moments
grave
as
his
face
could
be
when
in
repose
very
well
he
agreed
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
work
at
this
task
as
you
do
at
the
loom
with
all
your
might
and
i
shall
have
to
lengthen
my
stride
to
keep
up
with
you
but
that
promises
well
one
is
likely
to
fall
into
habits
of
soldiering
when
one
works
alone
you
have
no
idea
how
carefully
i
have
to
keep
certain
favourite
books
out
of
sight
when
i
want
to
accomplish
big
stretches
of
work
and
in
this
room
hard
luck
i
see
so
many
old
treasures
that
i
going
to
have
a
bit
of
trouble
in
resisting
temptation
his
eyes
led
hers
to
the
old
bookcases
she
nodded
it
a
shabby
old
collection
but
it
very
dear
to
father
heart
it
well
may
be
gibbon
hume
froude
parton
lamb
johnson
carlyle
hugo
thackeray
reade
and
trollope
keats
shelley
and
the
rest
what
matters
the
binding
some
time
i
must
read
you
a
passage
in
good
old
christopher
north
that
appeals
to
me
tremendously
no
not
now
miss
warne
i
see
i
must
fall
upon
my
task
without
delay
or
you
will
be
slipping
away
on
the
plea
of
bad
faith
on
my
part
well
he
turned
his
chair
toward
the
table
and
took
up
a
notebook
his
face
settled
instantly
into
an
expression
of
serious
interest
i
am
going
to
ask
you
first
said
he
to
copy
in
order
upon
a
fresh
sheet
each
reference
which
you
find
marked
with
a
red
cross
so
that
the
references
may
be
all
together
be
very
exact
please
and
very
legible
german
and
french
words
are
easily
misread
by
the
typist
who
will
put
this
work
finally
into
copy
for
the
printer
georgiana
glancing
at
the
first
marked
reference
found
cause
to
credit
this
statement
for
it
read
cagnetto

virchow
it
would
be
best
to
print
the
words
as
clearly
as
i
can
would
it
she
suggested
suppressing
her
desire
to
laugh
that
depends
on
your
handwriting
try
a
line
and
let
me
see
please
when
she
had
shown
him
a
specimen
of
the
peculiarly
readable
script
which
she
had
cultivated
in
college
he
signified
his
approval
with
a
hearty
good
that
a
splendid
hand
for
work
the
hand
of
a
workman
in
fact
i
congratulate
myself
go
ahead
with
the
only
verifying
each
reference
before
you
leave
it
thus
the
new
task
began
and
thus
it
continued
day
after
day
not
always
quite
the
same
for
georgiana
soon
recognized
that
her
employer
was
diversifying
her
labours
as
much
as
he
consistently
could
by
changing
the
nature
of
the
copying
now
and
then
he
refreshed
her
endurance
and
rested
her
tired
hand
by
asking
her
to
read
aloud
to
him
several
just
finished
pages
of
his
own
writing
walking
the
floor
meanwhile
or
sitting
tipped
back
in
his
chair
with
closed
eyes
while
he
listened
with
ears
alert
for
error
of
statement
or
infelicity
of
phrase
and
she
wondered
at
the
character
of
the
words
she
read
of
course
she
discovered
at
once
what
was
the
general
subject
of
the
book
no
essay
was
this
no
work
of
fiction
no
history
of
art
as
stuart
had
scornfully
suggested
it
could
be
only
the
sternest
of
research
and
experience
which
dictated
such
sentences
as
these
the
especial
dangers
to
be
contended
with
are
that
the
ethmoid
cells
may
be
mistaken
for
the
sphenoids
that
we
may
go
too
low
and
enter
the
pons
and
medulla
that
laterally
we
may
enter
the
cavernous
sinus
and
above
that
we
may
injure
the
optic
nerve
it
was
all
more
or
less
of
a
puzzle
to
her
but
it
was
one
which
her
taskmaster
never
explained
further
than
the
revelations
of
each
day
explained
it
she
understood
that
he
was
a
scientist
that
he
undoubtedly
had
been
an
operator
in
some
surgical
field
or
was
putting
into
shape
the
work
of
another
in
that
field
but
what
he
now
was
besides
a
writer
of
technical
books
she
had
no
manner
of
idea
but
i
really
enjoy
it
father
davy
she
insisted
when
she
came
down
to
him
one
day
with
hotly
flushed
cheeks
and
shaking
hand
after
a
particularly
protracted
siege
of
copying
involved
and
incomprehensible
material
it
monotonous
in
a
way
but
it
intensely
interesting
too
jefferson
is
so
absorbed
in
it
it
fun
to
watch
him
he
was
as
happy
as
a
boy
over
a
letter
he
had
just
received
from
a
professor
somebody
a
great
authority
in
vienna
it
seemed
it
absolutely
confirmed
some
statement
he
had
made
in
a
monograph
he
wrote
last
year
which
had
been
challenged
by
several
scientists
the
way
he
fell
to
writing
his
next
paragraph
after
he
had
read
that
letter
made
one
imagine
he
was
writing
it
in
his
own
heart
blood
he
read
it
aloud
to
me
she
laughed
appreciatively
at
the
recollection
could
you
make
anything
of
it
inquired
warne
with
interest
not
very
much
it
was
about
the
pituitary
body
oh
i
come
to
have
a
great
awe
of
the
pituitary
body
it
seems
to
be
responsible
for
so
many
things
he
chuckled
over
it
like
a
boy
and
said
to
me
these
transports
miss
warne
but
this
is
food
and
drink
to
me
i
wish
i
could
explain
it
to
you
so
that
you
might
rejoice
over
it
with
me
some
day
i
will
when
we
are
not
so
busy
i
hope
he
will
there
enough
that
i
do
understand
to
make
me
interested
i
see
you
are
and
rejoice
my
georgiana
do
you
remember
what
max
müller
says
echoed
by
many
another
is
life
to
me
and
when
i
am
no
longer
able
to
work
life
will
be
a
heavy
burden
he
smiled
as
he
said
it
but
his
daughter
read
the
longing
in
the
cheerful
voice
and
laid
her
cheek
for
an
instant
against
his
he
quite
right
and
you
have
your
work
father
davy
and
doing
it
all
the
time
i
think
you
preach
much
more
effectively
now
than
you
did
in
the
pulpit
even
when
you
do
open
your
mouth
and
when
you
do
open
it
angels
could
compete
with
you
they
laughed
softly
together
though
warne
shook
his
head
it
a
curious
thing
he
mused
that
the
weaker
the
body
gets
the
harder
does
the
mind
have
to
strive
to
master
it
but
thank
god
fight
i
not
as
one
that
beateth
the
as
one
that
beateth
the
air
murmured
the
girl
i
should
say
not
father
davy
as
one
that
delivereth
hard
blows
on
his
own
body
his
poor
tired
body
oh
if
i
had
one
tenth
the
at
which
she
ran
away
as
was
quite
like
her
when
emotion
suddenly
got
the
better
of
her
the
darkest
cloud
on
this
girl
life
was
the
frail
tenure
of
her
father
existence
the
rest
could
be
endured
the
work
in
the
upstairs
study
went
steadily
on
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
james
stuart
railed
and
that
miles
channing
came
at
least
once
in
seven
days
driving
the
sixty
miles
in
a
long
swiftly
speeding
car
which
brought
him
to
the
door
of
the
manse
before
the
early
may
sunset
and
which
took
him
back
when
the
shadows
lay
black
upon
the
silent
road
two
hours
in
the
morning
three
in
the
afternoon
georgiana
gave
to
the
rigid
performance
of
the
tasks
jefferson
set
her
while
outside
below
the
windows
at
which
she
worked
lay
her
garden
beloved
of
her
affection
beseeching
her
not
to
neglect
it
it
was
hard
sometimes
not
to
betray
how
she
longed
to
be
outside
as
she
wrote
on
and
on
copying
the
often
difficult
and
uninteresting
language
of
the
more
technical
part
of
her
employer
construction
and
one
afternoon
lifting
her
eyes
to
let
them
dwell
on
a
great
budding
purple
lilac
tree
with
the
warm
breath
of
the
breeze
which
had
drifted
across
the
apple
orchard
fanning
her
cheek
and
all
the
notes
of
rioting
spring
in
her
ears
she
did
draw
in
spite
of
herself
one
deep
sigh
of
longing
which
she
instantly
suppressed
too
late
her
companion
looked
up
quickly
noted
the
flush
in
the
cheek
and
the
hint
of
a
weary
shadow
under
the
dark
eyes
and
suddenly
pushed
aside
his
paper
then
he
drew
it
back
blotted
it
carefully
laid
it
with
a
pile
of
others
and
capped
his
pen
he
wheeled
about
in
his
chair
to
face
his
assistant
put
down
your
work
please
he
commanded
gently
precisely
where
you
are
do
finish
that
sentence
georgiana
looked
up
astonished
not
finish
the
sentence
no
did
you
never
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
i
afraid
i
have
but
i
did
suppose
you
ever
did
i
do
but
i
want
you
to
please
that
right
you
will
know
where
to
start
it
again
in
spite
of
herself
her
eyes
had
lighted
as
a
might
even
so
we
are
going
for
a
drive
in
all
this
beauty
if
i
can
find
a
horse
and
some
kind
of
a
vehicle
and
you
will
go
with
me
only
three
we
can
have
a
long
drive
between
now
and
the
hour
when
you
invariably
disappear
to
make
magic
for
our
appetites
how
about
it
i
can
keep
on
perfectly
well
you
know
she
said
with
pen
still
poised
above
her
paper
but
i
ca
he
was
smiling
now
that
the
other
plan
has
occurred
to
me
i
ca
keep
on
did
you
see
inside
my
mind
queried
georgiana
putting
away
her
copying
with
rapid
motions
suddenly
i
did
i
been
rather
blind
a
hard
taskmaster
i
been
conscious
of
what
was
going
on
outside
when
i
went
for
my
walks
but
the
work
is
absorbing
to
me
and
i
have
kept
you
too
steadily
at
it
we
both
need
a
rest
he
added
as
she
shook
her
head
chapter
xiv
out
of
the
blue
twenty
minutes
afterward
he
drove
up
to
the
door
with
the
best
that
the
village
liveryman
had
to
give
for
the
highest
price
his
customer
could
offer
a
tall
black
horse
of
fair
proportions
and
a
hurriedly
washed
buggy
of
the
type
in
vogue
in
country
districts
but
as
georgiana
went
down
the
path
she
was
conscious
that
the
figure
which
stood
hat
and
reins
in
hand
awaiting
her
would
lend
dignity
to
any
vehicle
short
of
a
wheelbarrow
in
which
he
might
be
seen
to
ride
then
presently
the
pair
were
driving
along
country
lanes
in
the
very
midst
of
all
the
burgeoning
beauty
of
the
season
and
georgiana
was
like
a
captive
bird
let
loose
her
companion
as
well
responded
to
the
call
of
nature
at
her
loveliest
and
the
tireless
worker
of
the
study
seemed
changed
at
a
word
to
a
idler
of
the
most
carefree
sort
the
two
gave
themselves
up
without
restraint
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
hour
i
wonder
how
long
it
is
said
jefferson
letting
the
reins
lie
loose
at
a
leafy
curve
of
the
road
while
the
black
horse
willingly
walked
since
i
have
had
a
drive
like
this
not
for
ten
years
at
least
you
lived
always
in
a
great
city
since
boyhood
in
the
heart
of
it
and
have
driven
motors
not
horses
for
those
ten
years
yes
like
everybody
else
but
i
spent
all
my
summers
as
a
boy
on
my
grandfather
farm
and
there
i
drove
horses
and
rode
them
and
did
acrobatic
feats
on
their
bare
backs
i
was
a
wild
indian
a
cowboy
and
a
captain
of
cavalry
by
turns
those
were
happy
days
and
on
a
day
like
this
they
do
seem
long
ago
they
ca
be
so
dreadfully
long
ago
she
dared
with
a
glance
at
the
interesting
profile
beside
her
ca
they
do
i
look
pretty
aged
compared
with
your
youth
i
not
so
remarkably
young
she
retorted
are
you
you
are
about
ten
years
younger
than
i
that
a
big
leap
and
must
make
me
seem
a
grandfather
indeed
but
you
do
know
how
old
i
am
i
could
come
pretty
close
to
it
said
he
with
a
quick
look
how
could
you
know
when
you
see
a
spray
of
apple
blossoms
like
those
he
pointed
toward
a
mass
of
pink
and
white
at
the
stage
of
perfection
beyond
an
old
rail
fence
ca
you
tell
at
a
glance
whether
they
been
out
a
day
or
a
week
i
should
say
that
if
things
had
happened
to
them
to
make
them
feel
as
if
they
been
out
a
week
when
they
had
been
out
only
two
days
a
heavy
rain
for
instance
in
that
case
we
should
be
deceived
perhaps
but
in
the
case
of
a
human
being
those
heavy
rains
sometimes
only
mature
without
fading
hello
what
this
a
small
and
very
ragged
boy
had
emerged
suddenly
from
a
meadow
gateway
his
face
convulsed
with
pain
and
fright
he
nursed
one
hand
in
the
other
and
the
colour
had
deserted
his
round
cheek
leaving
it
pallid
under
its
freckles
the
only
house
nearby
was
an
abandoned
one
and
there
were
no
others
for
some
distance
in
either
direction
jefferson
stopped
his
horse
does
it
hurt
badly
lad
he
asked
in
the
friendliest
of
tones
which
yet
had
a
bracing
quality
do
you
want
to
let
me
see
if
i
can
help
it
the
boy
stood
still
tears
silently
making
their
way
down
his
face
giving
the
reins
to
georgiana
jefferson
jumped
out
and
gently
examined
the
small
hand
the
middle
finger
of
which
as
the
onlooker
could
plainly
see
was
badly
distorted
and
somewhat
swollen
the
skin
however
did
not
seem
to
be
broken
we
can
make
that
more
comfortable
right
away
the
man
promised
the
little
boy
sit
down
on
the
grass
for
a
minute
or
two
laddie
while
i
find
something
i
want
he
pulled
out
a
handkerchief
as
yet
folded
and
fresh
from
its
ironing
and
handed
it
to
georgiana
will
you
tear
that
into
strips
an
inch
wide
please
while
i
take
a
look
back
here
for
a
bit
of
wood
and
he
disappeared
down
the
road
while
georgiana
with
the
aid
of
her
strong
white
teeth
tore
the
fine
linen
as
he
had
bidden
and
spoke
comfortingly
to
the
little
fellow
who
seemed
glad
enough
to
have
fallen
into
friendly
hands
when
he
shortly
returned
jefferson
was
rapidly
cutting
and
whittling
a
stick
into
a
little
splint
which
he
then
wound
carefully
with
a
strip
of
the
handkerchief
until
it
was
covered
from
view
then
he
took
the
injured
hand
in
his
own
capable
ones
his
assistant
had
often
noted
those
hands
and
said
quietly
i
going
to
hurt
you
just
a
minute
little
man
but
you
be
all
right
so
be
game
and
in
two
deft
motions
he
had
pulled
and
twisted
the
broken
finger
and
had
set
it
straight
as
the
others
with
but
one
sharp
outcry
from
the
owner
in
less
time
than
it
can
be
told
in
the
set
finger
was
bound
securely
with
its
neighbouring
finger
to
the
padded
splint
and
the
whole
neatly
bandaged
with
the
torn
linen
the
entire
procedure
accomplished
with
the
rapidity
and
skill
of
the
practised
hand
no
amateur
surgery
this
as
georgiana
understood
well
enough
there
said
jefferson
drawing
forth
another
handkerchief
as
spotless
as
the
first
she
wondered
if
he
went
always
thus
provided
against
emergency
and
improvising
a
little
sling
in
which
the
bandaged
hand
swung
comfortably
i
think
you
do
rest
a
bit
and
then
go
home
and
tell
your
mother
not
to
touch
that
finger
for
three
weeks
by
that
time
it
will
be
as
good
as
new
only
be
careful
with
it
when
you
first
use
it
laddie
and
better
luck
next
time
georgiana
saw
the
uninjured
hand
of
the
boy
close
over
something
bright
as
the
man
hand
left
it
and
heard
a
low
sound
which
might
have
been
almost
anything
indicative
of
surprise
and
joy
then
the
black
horse
was
moving
on
and
jefferson
was
saying
were
we
talking
about
apple
blossoms
we
had
finished
with
them
i
think
georgiana
replied
wondering
if
he
really
were
going
to
offer
no
explanation
of
the
hint
of
mystery
which
had
been
about
him
ever
since
her
work
with
him
had
begun
but
he
did
not
offer
any
only
went
on
with
the
pleasant
talk
with
which
he
had
all
along
beguiled
the
way
georgiana
was
recognizing
this
afternoon
more
than
she
had
yet
done
what
a
mind
was
possessed
by
this
unassuming
man
whose
manner
and
speech
yet
did
not
lack
that
quality
of
quiet
assurance
which
is
the
product
only
of
genuine
knowledge
and
experience
the
black
horse
was
within
a
mile
of
home
passing
through
the
last
stretch
of
woodland
which
would
justify
the
walking
pace
in
which
greatly
to
his
astonishment
he
was
being
allowed
to
indulge
at
all
such
points
when
a
motor
car
slowing
down
beside
him
caused
him
to
lay
back
his
ears
in
displeasure
georgiana
turning
beheld
the
handsome
eager
face
of
miles
channing
as
he
leaned
toward
her
his
hand
hushing
his
engine
as
he
spoke
miss
warne
jefferson
forgive
me
for
stopping
you
i
should
have
gone
on
and
waited
for
you
if
i
had
been
sure
you
were
on
your
way
home
but
i
a
messenger
from
the
croftons
they
beg
you
to
let
me
bring
you
back
with
me
his
eyes
rested
on
georgiana
is
anybody
ill
oh
no
no
nothing
like
that
it
for
quite
a
different
reason
they
want
you
only
i
to
ask
you
not
to
question
me
you
to
come
on
faith
if
you
will
and
they
agree
to
have
you
back
in
the
morning
by
if
you
insist
georgiana
looked
puzzled
but
being
human
she
was
naturally
interested
and
attracted
by
this
mysterious
plan
it
very
odd
she
mused
but
if
father
can
spare
me
i
will
undertake
to
see
that
your
father
is
not
lonely
this
evening
said
jefferson
quiet
voice
at
her
side
and
please
do
bother
about
morning
or
at
all
if
you
would
like
to
be
away
if
jefferson
would
object
began
channing
but
jefferson
anticipated
him
please
do
hesitate
to
go
on
with
channing
if
you
would
like
to
gain
a
little
time
he
suggested
to
his
companion
he
will
have
you
at
home
before
i
can
reach
the
bend
in
the
road
georgiana
looked
round
at
him
i
prefer
to
finish
one
ride
before
i
begin
another
she
declared
smiling
it
only
a
mile
channing
we
shall
be
there
nearly
as
soon
as
you
please
go
on
it
thus
came
about
ten
minutes
later
that
james
stuart
walking
up
to
his
home
from
a
field
where
he
had
been
superintending
an
interesting
new
departure
in
cultivation
caught
sight
first
of
a
roadster
of
aristocratic
lines
whose
appearance
thereabouts
had
become
most
unwelcome
and
shortly
thereafter
of
a
less
pretentious
vehicle
being
rapidly
drawn
by
a
still
more
familiar
black
horse
and
occupied
by
two
people
whom
it
gave
stuart
no
acute
pleasure
to
see
together
well
i
should
say
george
was
displaying
her
admirers
in
great
shape
this
afternoon
he
said
gloomily
to
himself
it
a
wonder
i
not
trailing
on
behind
with
a
wheelbarrow
but
i
vow
i
like
to
know
since
when
her
contract
with
jefferson
has
taken
them
out
into
the
country
and
in
working
hours
too
afterward
it
was
all
rather
a
strange
memory
to
georgiana
when
she
recalled
it
she
had
flown
about
to
prepare
the
appetizing
early
supper
with
which
she
was
accustomed
to
serve
her
small
family
and
to
which
she
now
added
a
delicacy
or
two
on
account
of
its
seeming
the
natural
thing
to
ask
mr
miles
channing
to
remain
rather
than
to
allow
him
to
go
to
the
small
village
hotel
then
she
had
cleared
her
table
and
left
the
to
the
neighbour
who
was
to
come
to
the
rescue
as
before
she
had
dressed
with
hurried
fingers
for
the
trip
and
had
driven
away
with
a
devoted
escort
who
spared
no
pains
to
make
her
feel
that
he
was
exceedingly
pleased
at
the
success
of
his
mission
there
was
no
place
in
her
memory
for
something
she
did
not
see
nor
would
have
thought
of
imagining
significant
if
she
had
seen
it
when
she
left
the
house
jefferson
was
in
his
room
searching
for
a
book
from
which
to
read
aloud
to
his
charge
of
the
evening
when
he
heard
georgiana
blithe
cry
of
farewell
to
her
father
in
the
doorway
below
he
left
the
bookcase
and
went
with
a
quick
step
to
the
window
he
watched
the
car
driven
by
channing
out
of
sight
down
the
road
then
he
descended
to
the
garden
pipe
in
hand
before
he
returned
to
the
house
to
take
his
place
by
the
evening
lamp
and
begin
the
reading
to
the
gentle
invalid
stretched
on
the
couch
he
had
covered
many
furlongs
up
and
down
the
straggling
pathways
and
had
consumed
much
more
than
his
usual
quota
of
choice
tobacco
and
though
all
about
him
had
been
the
may
environment
at
its
loveliest
through
all
his
marching
up
and
down
he
had
never
once
looked
up
miles
away
and
ever
more
miles
away
georgiana
had
flown
like
the
wind
in
the
swift
car
under
its
skilfully
guiding
hand
the
drive
was
a
blurred
impression
of
slowly
gathering
rosy
twilight
of
the
odour
of
the
apple
blossoms
somehow
a
different
and
more
seductive
fragrance
than
it
had
been
in
the
sunlit
afternoon
and
always
there
was
the
sense
of
there
being
beside
her
a
presence
which
disturbed
channing
low
laugh
his
vibrant
voice
in
her
ear
the
things
he
said
half
serious
half
earnest
always
full
of
an
only
slightly
veiled
intent
the
girl
who
had
spent
so
many
days
of
her
life
in
hard
study
or
harder
housewifery
could
do
no
less
than
yield
herself
for
the
hour
to
the
charm
of
it
and
forget
everything
else
just
as
twilight
settled
into
dusk
and
for
the
first
time
the
headlights
of
the
car
came
on
with
a
long
reach
like
a
golden
ribbon
along
the
road
channing
suddenly
slowing
down
a
few
miles
out
of
the
city
began
a
rapid
speech
on
a
subject
so
unexpected
that
it
fairly
took
his
hearer
breath
away
it
not
fair
of
me
to
tell
you
but
i
simply
got
to
get
in
the
first
word
you
must
pretend
you
have
heard
it
but
if
there
any
persuading
to
be
done
i
want
my
share
and
want
it
first
your
cousins
are
going
to
invite
you
to
sail
with
them
next
week
for
a
summer
in
england
after
a
fortnight
in
paris
paris
in
june
you
do
know
what
that
means
you
ca
even
imagine
it
i
can
i
know
it
do
i
know
it
he
laughed
softly
since
they
to
be
away
and
wo
need
her
they
send
down
their
housekeeper
the
most
competent
person
in
the
world
to
stay
with
your
father
and
make
him
absolutely
comfortable
so
you
do
have
to
hesitate
on
that
score
it
perfectly
wonderful
but
georgiana
was
staring
at
him
through
the
dusk
but
oh
i
could
channing
how
could
i
father
is
so
feeble
something
might
happen
not
in
summer
things
do
happen
to
elderly
people
in
summer

in
winter
pneumonia
and
things
like
that
and
do
you
know
he
be
delighted
to
have
you
go
he
would
let
you
miss
such
a
chance
i
know
him
already
well
enough
for
that
but
you
see
i
engaged
to
work
for
jefferson
well
he
be
all
right
he
a
traveled
man
himself
anybody
can
see
that
he
would
stand
in
the
way
of
your
good
not
for
a
moment
of
course
he
would
he
urge
you
to
go
why
there
nothing
else
for
you
to
do
think
of
the
glorious
summer
we
have
glorious
why
i
what
do
you
mean
i
do
understand
georgiana
felt
her
cheeks
grow
scarlet
in
the
darkness
mean
what
could
i
mean
why
i
going
too
of
course
sailing
when
you
do
invited
to
spend
a
month
in
devon
with
the
croftons
and
you
his
voice
sank
lower
and
that
fortnight
in
paris
oh
i
be
in
paris
too
no
doubt
of
that
i
show
you
what
paris

like
on
a
june
evening

you
think
i
want
to
send
you

this
country
if
i
were
going

i
georgiana
chapter
xv
great
luck
father
davy
are
you
sure
begged
his
daughter
sure
that
i
want
you
to
go
daughter
very
sure
what
sort
of
father
should
i
be
if
i
were
willing
to
deny
you
this
great
pleasure
merely
to
insure
my
own
comfort
and
i
shall
be
comfortable
why
should
i
not
be
with
the
good
perkins
to
look
after
me
and
our
fine
friend
jefferson
to
bear
me
company
in
the
evenings
as
often
as
he
can
and
with
james
stuart
who
is
like
a
son
and
with
your
letters
arriving
with
every
foreign
mail
dismiss
these
fears
my
dear
and
take
your
happy
chance
to
see
something
of
the
old
world
many
a
delightful
evening
will
we
have
together
next
winter
you
and
i
over
the
photographs
you
will
bring
back
while
you
discourse
to
me
of
your
adventures
thus
david
warne
in
his
most
reassuring
manner
while
his
daughter
studied
his
delicate
pallid
face
her
heart
smiting
her
for
being
willing
to
leave
him
to
the
loneliness
she
knew
in
spite
of
all
his
protests
he
would
suffer
in
her
absence
and
yet
opportunities
like
this
one
did
not
occur
everyday
might
not
come
again
in
her
lifetime
and
everybody
was
conspiring
to
make
it
possible
for
her
it
goes
without
saying
jefferson
had
told
her
at
once
that
all
other
engagements
should
be
cancelled
in
the
face
of
such
an
invitation
as
this
we
will
all
look
after
your
father
for
you
and
as
far
as
your
work
with
me
is
concerned
do
give
it
another
thought
i
shall
make
rather
slower
progress
without
you
of
course
but
when
you
return
we
will
take
great
strides
and
complete
it
well
within
the
limit
i
have
set
so
go
by
all
means
and
good
luck
as
for
james
mckenzie
stuart
his
words
of
persuasion
seemed
to
be
tempered
by
various
other
emotions
than
those
of
unselfish
desire
for
georgiana
pleasure
of
course
it
great
and
there
no
doubt
that
you
must
go
he
said
he
was
sitting
upon
the
rear
porch
of
the
manse
looking
off
toward
georgiana
garden
on
the
second
evening
after
her
return
from
the
hurried
drive
to
the
croftons
i
do
all
i
can
for
your
father
of
course
but
do
ask
me
to
console
the
georgiana
laughed
merrily
he
not
need
any
consolation
jimps
nor
you
either
jeannette
told
me
to
tell
you
that
she
write
to
you
once
a
fortnight
if
you
answer
no
she
did
say
that
yes
she
did
and
meant
it
i
write
too
of
course
you
be
deluged
with
letters
and
picture
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
so
much
attention
letters
are
all
right
we
wo
say
anything
about
the
and
i
hope
you
both
keep
your
promises
but
when
i
think
of
all
these
summer
evenings
without
you
he
heaved
a
gusty
sigh
which
georgiana
had
no
reason
to
doubt
was
genuine
how
much
heavier
would
be
his
spirits
if
he
were
told
that
miles
channing
was
to
be
of
the
party
she
had
full
consciousness
she
was
aware
of
the
futility
of
attempting
to
keep
this
unwelcome
news
from
him
longer
than
the
day
of
her
departure
but
she
had
not
thus
far
ventured
to
mention
it
i
shall
miss
these
evenings
myself
she
said
soberly
after
all
jimps
i
expect
there
be
nobody
gladder
to
get
back
home
than
i
shall
see
this
old
garden
in
my
dreams
then
quickly
as
another
breath
warned
her
that
sentimental
ground
was
dangerous
she
cried
oh
but
jimps
i
have
told
you
of
the
last
and
nicest
thing
that
wonderful
girl
has
done
for
me
she
insisted
on
my
bringing
home
the
dearest
little
traveling
suit
of
some
kind
of
lovely
summer
serge
that
does
spot
and
does
muss
and
is
altogether
adorable
she
insists
it
not
becoming
to
her
and
it
really
is
but
i
almost
know
she
planned
not
to
have
it
becoming
so
she
could
give
it
away
to
me
and
a
perfect
beauty
of
a
little
hat
and
a
big
loose
coat
to
wear
on
the
steamer
that
looks
absolutely
new
but
she
vows
it
is
and
that
she
tired
of
it
was
ever
anybody
so
lucky
as
i
it
certainly
does
take
clothes
to
stir
up
a
girl
was
stuart
cynical
comment
talk
of
separation
and
they
pretend
to
be
as
sad
over
it
as
you
are
but
let
think
about
the
clothes
they
going
to
wear
and
their
spirits
leap
up
like
soda
water
poor
old
jimps
does
he
know
the
sustaining
qualities
of
pretty
clothes
too
bad
but
really
it
lucky
i
have
something
to
sustain
me
it
such
a
pull
to
make
myself
go
i
did
suppose
i
ever
leave
father
davy
this
way
while
he
is
so
feeble
but
he
the
most
urgent
of
all
to
send
me
off
and
i
know
i
really
can
bring
him
back
wonderful
pleasure
thus
the
talks
ran
during
the
few
days
which
elapsed
before
departure
every
spare
hour
was
full
with
preparation
from
the
packing
of
the
trim
little
steamer
trunk
which
arrived
by
express
a
gift
from
uncle
thomas
to
the
careful
mending
and
putting
in
perfect
order
of
every
article
father
davy
would
be
likely
to
wear
during
the
whole
period
of
his
daughter
absence
georgiana
thoughts
as
she
worked
were
a
curious
mixture
of
happy
anticipation
and
actual
dread
if
only
i
could
go
as
jeannette
is
going
she
said
to
herself
without
a
care
in
the
world
except
to
plan
how
she
will
fill
the
summer
and
to
make
sure
her
maid
puts
in
plenty
of
silk
stockings
to
last
till
she
can
buy
some
more
in
paris
when
i
went
to
college
it
was
with
the
fear
that
i
ought
not
to
accept
father
sacrifice
even
though
aunt
harriet
was
with
him
then
and
he
was
far
far
stronger
than
he
is
now
i
never
done
anything
in
my
life
without
a
guilty
feeling
that
i
ought
not
to
be
doing
it
why
ca
i
do
now
as
they
all
bid
me
drop
my
cares
and
take
my
fun
like
any
other
girl
i
will
i
must
it
only
fair
the
excitement
of
anticipation
grew
upon
her
as
the
busy
hours
slipped
away
the
regrets
and
anxieties
diminished
with
every
day
came
fresh
and
delightfully
interesting
contributions
to
her
outfitting
from
jeannette
or
aunt
olivia
a
handsome
little
handbag
of
silk
and
silver
to
match
the
traveling
suit
a
snug
toilet
case
of
soft
blue
leather
holding
everything
mortal
woman
could
want
on
train
or
ship
a
great
woolly
steamer
rug
to
use
on
shipboard
georgiana
could
only
catch
her
breath
at
such
kindness
and
dash
off
hasty
notes
of
spirited
thanks
and
protests
against
any
more
of
the
same
sort
but
in
spite
of
her
pride
it
was
impossible
to
resist
accepting
these
and
other
gifts
they
seemed
prompted
by
such
genuine
affection
the
day
came
the
trunk
was
closed
and
strapped
jefferson
had
done
the
strapping
coming
upon
the
prospective
traveler
in
the
upper
hall
where
she
was
trying
in
vain
to
bring
leather
thong
and
buckle
into
the
proper
relations
have
i
yet
proved
my
right
to
the
title
of
man
in
the
house
he
inquired
as
he
did
the
trick
with
the
masculine
ease
which
is
ever
a
source
of
envy
to
those
whose
hands
are
weaker
indeed
you
have
but
i
shall
never
get
over
feeling
that
i
have
to
do
everything
for
myself
it
will
be
some
one
privilege
to
teach
you
better
some
time
was
his
rejoinder
meanwhile
those
of
us
who
are
near
at
hand
are
only
too
happy
to
act
as
deputies
between
her
three
men
as
jeannette
had
called
them
georgiana
was
allowed
to
do
little
for
herself
at
the
last
she
was
to
meet
her
cousins
as
the
train
went
through
their
city
but
stuart
had
invited
himself
to
accompany
her
to
that
point
thus
giving
himself
a
chance
as
he
said
to
clinch
that
bargain
with
jeannette
concerning
the
promised
letters
and
therefore
georgiana
farewells
were
not
to
be
all
said
at
once
for
which
she
was
thankful
it
was
quite
enough
to
take
leave
of
father
davy
who
was
looking
it
seemed
to
his
daughter
eyes
on
that
sultry
june
morning
a
shade
paler
and
weaker
than
usual
it
the
sudden
summer
heat
dear
he
said
with
the
brightest
of
smiles
as
with
her
arms
about
him
she
questioned
him
nothing
more
there
there
my
little
girl
do
let
your
fancy
get
the
better
of
you
i
very
well
indeed
and
shall
soon
be
used
to
the
summer
weather
go
and
god
be
with
you
dearest
it
does
matter
about
his
going
with
me
if
he
only
stay
with
you
murmured
georgiana
vainly
struggling
with
herself
that
she
might
take
a
bright
and
tearless
farewell
of
this
dear
being
he
will
go
with
you
and
he
will
stay
with
me
said
warne
cheerfully
so
be
at
rest
here
i
written
you
a
steamer
letter
read
it
when
the
good
ship
sails
and
think
of
me
as
rejoicing
in
your
happiness
it
was
over
at
last
and
she
was
off
at
the
gate
she
had
turned
to
jefferson
who
was
carrying
her
handbag
to
the
village
stage
from
which
stuart
had
leaped
to
run
up
to
the
porch
and
say
a
word
of
cheer
to
warne
sitting
in
a
big
chair
i
ca
tell
you
what
a
comfort
it
is
jefferson
she
said
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
to
know
that
you
are
here
i
have
worked
with
you
for
six
weeks
not
to
understand
that
it
is
no
mere
author
of
a
scientific
treatise
who
is
staying
with
my
father
no
he
smiled
into
her
lifted
eyes
and
his
look
was
that
of
a
friend
whom
one
may
trust
well
miss
georgiana
if
it
is
of
any
support
to
you
to
be
told
that
whatever
knowledge
or
skill
i
may
have
is
all
at
the
service
of
your
father
then
i
am
glad
to
assure
you
of
that
fact
i
will
do
my
best
for
him
always
and
may
it
be
a
happy
time
from
first
to
last
his
hand
held
hers
close
as
he
said
these
words
and
continued
to
hold
it
for
a
moment
longer
while
he
gave
her
a
long
and
intent
look
she
felt
a
strange
pang
it
was
almost
as
if
she
could
think
he
was
going
to
miss
her
yet
she
knew
better
if
he
missed
her
it
would
be
only
because
he
had
become
accustomed
to
having
her
about
no
sign
of
any
more
uncommon
interest
had
he
ever
shown
then
stuart
farther
down
the
path
was
calling
come
george
all
but
late
now
and
she
was
in
the
old
stage
and
it
was
lumbering
off
down
the
road
while
neighbours
waved
from
their
windows
and
georgiana
strained
her
eyes
to
get
a
last
look
at
the
figure
on
the
porch
on
the
train
she
and
stuart
somehow
found
little
to
say
to
each
other
in
the
ride
of
an
hour
and
a
half
to
the
city
station
where
the
rest
of
the
party
came
aboard
stuart
did
not
catch
sight
of
miles
channing
until
the
last
minute
of
the
train
stop
he
had
filled
the
earlier
period
of
the
detention
in
the
station
with
a
hurried
talk
with
jeannette
during
which
georgiana
noted
that
the
two
seemed
thoroughly
absorbed
in
each
other
it
was
small
wonder
for
jeannette
had
never
been
more
radiantly
lovely
than
in
the
distinguished
plainness
of
her
traveling
costume
she
seemed
very
happy
as
she
presumably
bargained
with
stuart
for
letters
and
jimps
himself
had
never
looked
more
interested
in
any
proposition
than
in
that
one
suddenly
however
the
wait
was
over
georgiana
turned
from
greeting
channing
who
had
just
come
aboard
followed
by
a
porter
with
his
luggage
when
she
heard
stuart
voice
in
her
ear
george
is
going
i
believe
he
is
she
admitted
trying
not
to
let
her
colour
rise
beneath
the
accusing
expression
in
his
eyes
and
you
did
mention
it
did
i
he
jeannette
and
rosalie
friend
not
mine
no
he
something
more
than
a
friend
to
you
or
means
to
be
i
might
have
known
he
work
this
scheme
it
to
you
in
earnest
then
jimps
please
do
it
nothing
of
the
sort
i
the
train
began
to
move
but
instead
of
a
hasty
and
a
leap
from
the
steps
james
stuart
stood
still
i
believe
i
go
on
for
another
hour
he
said
coolly
with
a
glance
at
his
watch
i
can
get
off
at
the
next
stop
meanwhile
miss
jeannette
the
observation
platform
seems
to
be
nearly
empty
would
you
care
to
sit
out
there
a
while
since
i
no
chair
in
here
now
and
the
car
is
full
georgiana
sitting
facing
miles
channing
she
wondered
who
was
responsible
for
the
fact
that
his
chair
proved
to
be
next
hers
saw
his
eyes
as
he
glanced
toward
the
rear
of
the
car
follow
stuart
and
jeannette
he
a
mighty
nice
fellow
is
he
he
commented
pleasantly
too
bad
he
is
coming
along
seems
tremendously
interested
in
jeannette
and
it
quite
evident
that
she
likes
him
as
much
as
is
good
for
him
these
partings
well
i
sorry
for
him
but
he
means
to
make
the
most
of
this
last
hour
it
would
be
unkind
of
us
to
follow
them
out
there
it
though
i
was
about
to
propose
going
out
when
he
stole
a
march
on
me
it
would
be
very
unkind
agreed
georgiana
gayly
yes
i
wish
he
could
have
the
whole
journey
he
deserves
a
rest
and
change
he
one
of
the
finest
men
i
know
now
that
channing
was
beside
her
with
his
handsome
face
and
faultlessly
dressed
figure
easily
the
most
attractive
man
in
the
car
she
could
not
begrudge
jeannette
this
final
hour
with
stuart
though
her
pride
smarted
a
little
under
the
change
in
his
manner
toward
herself
she
had
read
in
her
cousin
face
as
jeannette
eyes
met
stuart
when
she
first
caught
sight
of
him
that
she
was
much
more
than
commonly
glad
to
see
him
and
the
observer
had
noted
with
what
an
air
of
joyous
comradeship
the
two
had
hurried
laughing
down
the
aisle
to
the
rear
door
after
stuart
proposal
but
the
hour
was
soon
over
it
was
not
until
the
train
stopped
that
jeannette
and
stuart
returned
to
the
others
inside
the
car
and
then
the
farewells
were
necessarily
hurried
with
a
smiling
face
stuart
shook
hands
with
them
all
leaving
his
best
friend
to
the
last
according
to
the
unwritten
law
of
farewells
when
he
came
to
her
he
looked
very
nearly
straight
into
her
eyes
not
quite
it
might
have
been
her
lower
eyelashes
upon
which
he
brought
his
glance
to
bear
great
luck
georgiana
he
said
distinctly
and
all
kinds
of
a
good
time
jimps
and
thank
you
very
very
much
for
coming
she
responded
it
was
hardly
to
be
believed
that
james
stuart
would
not
lower
his
voice
and
murmur
some
last
word
for
her
ear
alone
for
this
had
long
been
his
custom
instead
he
gave
her
a
brilliant
smile
and
turned
again
to
jeannette
once
more
he
said
and
added
something
under
his
breath
in
response
to
which
jeannette
nodded
smiling
and
went
with
him
to
the
front
end
of
the
car
where
she
alone
was
the
last
to
wave
farewell
as
he
looked
back
from
the
platform
georgiana
caught
a
final
glimpse
of
him
as
he
ran
along
it
with
bared
head
and
the
whole
party
waved
hands
and
called
parting
salutes
in
which
she
joined
then
jeannette
came
back
and
georgiana
looked
searchingly
at
her
her
own
heart
experiencing
an
uncomfortable
sort
of
depression
as
she
saw
the
exquisite
flush
on
her
cousin
cheek
and
the
light
in
her
eyes
in
the
manger
georgiana
sternly
reproached
herself
in
her
own
thoughts
is
it
enough
for
you
to
have
one
man
looking
devotion
at
you
but
you
must
claim
everybody
in
sight
and
she
made
a
determined
and
partially
successful
effort
not
to
mind
that
things
had
turned
out
as
they
had
only
she
and
james
stuart
had
been
friends
a
very
long
time
and
she
was
sorry
to
have
the
parting
from
him
tinged
by
a
cloud
of
misunderstanding
it
would
have
been
much
better
she
admitted
to
herself
now
to
have
told
him
frankly
in
the
beginning
that
miles
channing
was
to
be
of
the
party
chapter
xvi
a
little
trunk
it
was
a
journey
of
only
a
few
hours
to
the
dock
where
the
party
were
to
take
ship
the
sailing
being
set
for
early
afternoon
before
it
seemed
possible
they
had
left
the
train
and
were
being
conveyed
by
motor
to
the
pier
it
was
at
the
first
whiff
of
fragrance
that
georgiana
felt
a
sudden
onset
of
dread
of
the
sailing
of
the
great
ship
and
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
four
black
funnels
rising
above
the
mass
of
smaller
smokestacks
and
masts
and
spars
which
lifted
beyond
the
dingy
buildings
of
the
pier
she
experienced
an
unexpected
and
disconcerting
longing
to
run
away
back
to
her
home
her
father
face
rose
before
her
as
she
had
seen
it
that
morning
pale
and
worn
the
inner
brightness
of
the
undaunted
spirit
shining
through
the
thinnest
of
veils
what
if
anything
should
happen
to
that
beloved
face
so
that
she
should
never
set
eyes
on
it
again
the
thought
shook
her
with
a
throb
of
pain
they
were
on
the
pier
they
were
ascending
the
gangway
they
were
on
one
of
the
lower
decks
and
entering
the
elevator
which
was
to
lift
them
past
many
intermediate
decks
to
that
one
next
the
highest
of
all
where
their
quarters
lay
and
when
they
came
out
upon
that
upper
deck
georgiana
was
dimly
conscious
that
they
were
a
party
to
attract
attention
even
among
many
people
evidently
of
the
same
class
any
party
to
which
aunt
olivia
and
jeannette
belonged
she
felt
must
necessarily
expect
to
be
noticed
of
her
own
contribution
to
the
party
distinction
she
was
entirely
unaware
but
now
that
she
was
actually
on
shipboard
where
during
the
last
fortnight
she
had
so
many
times
imagined
herself
georgiana
found
to
her
distress
that
she
could
not
for
a
moment
banish
the
thought
the
image
itself
of
that
gentle
suffering
face
at
home
not
that
she
wanted
to
forget
it
not
that
but
she
did
want
now
that
her
decision
was
made
to
be
able
to
appreciate
what
a
happy
occasion
it
was
and
how
fortunate
the
circumstances
which
had
brought
about
her
presence
here
the
last
place
in
the
world
she
had
expected
ever
to
be
in
she
entered
the
stateroom
which
she
was
to
share
with
her
cousins
and
was
amazed
at
the
size
and
comfort
of
it
it
was
half
filled
with
flowers
and
baskets
of
fruit
and
other
offerings
sent
for
the
girls
with
two
boxes
addressed
to
herself
both
stuart
and
jefferson
had
sent
her
flowers
as
she
examined
them
a
hurried
steward
appeared
with
a
third
box
which
proved
to
be
also
for
her
a
small
box
which
had
come
not
from
a
city
florist
like
the
others
but
by
mail
it
had
been
put
up
by
unskilled
hands
as
its
crushed
shape
and
damp
exterior
clearly
showed
she
opened
it
wondering
and
found
a
little
bunch
of
garden
flowers
sadly
wilted
their
limp
stems
protruding
from
the
moistened
newspaper
in
which
they
were
wrapped
she
searched
for
a
card
and
found
it
in
a
hand
she
knew
well
a
little
cramped
a
little
wavering
but
full
of
character
she
read
these
words
blessing
her
praying
for
her
loving
her
georgiana
heart
gave
a
great
leap
of
fear
what
were
those
lines
what
the
context
she
knew
them
knew
them
well
she
had
never
heard
her
father
quote
them
and
never
read
with
him
the
lines
from
which
they
came
did
he
know
them
use
them
with
intent
not
imagining
she
would
place
them
as
she
well
remembered
they
were
from
enoch
arden
and
she
had
spoken
them
herself
in
a
dramatized
version
of
that
pathetic
poem
the
last
winter
of
her
college
life
and
they
ran
thus
when
you
shall
see
her
tell
her
that
i
died
blessing
her
praying
for
her
loving
her
at
the
moment
she
was
alone
in
the
stateroom
the
two
girls
having
been
an
instant
before
summoned
by
their
brother
to
meet
some
friends
who
had
come
on
board
to
see
them
off
she
stood
staring
at
the
touching
little
bunch
of
faded
bloom
knowing
just
how
tender
had
been
the
thought
of
her
which
had
prompted
the
effort
it
had
not
occurred
to
warne
that
there
was
any
other
way
of
sending
flowers
to
ships
than
by
mailing
them
from
one
own
garden
as
for
the
words
she
knew
well
enough
that
he
had
not
dreamed
of
disturbing
her
content
by
quoting
them
yet
she
could
but
feel
that
the
reason
why
they
came
to
his
mind
when
he
was
searching
there
for
a
bit
of
tender
sentiment
to
send
with
his
parting
gift
was
the
thought
of
his
own
possible
end
being
not
far
away
and
if
he
too
were
thinking
of
that
with
a
heart
georgiana
stood
staring
out
of
the
open
porthole
at
the
scene
of
activity
outside
far
below
her
she
could
see
the
gangway
over
which
she
had
come
on
board
in
less
than
an
hour
the
party
had
arrived
early
that
gangway
would
be
withdrawn
the
water
would
slowly
widen
between
pier
and
ship
and
there
would
be
no
turning
back
could
she
go
could
she
bear
to
go
and
take
the
chance
were
her
fears
only
the
natural
forebodings
of
the
unaccustomed
traveler
or
was
there
a
real
reason
why
she
should
never
have
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
to
leave
one
whose
hold
on
life
was
so
frail
the
only
being
in
the
world
to
whom
she
was
closely
bound
she
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
think
thomas
crofton
turning
from
a
group
of
friends
at
the
touch
of
her
niece
hand
upon
hers
would
have
drawn
the
girl
into
the
circle
and
presented
her
with
genuine
pride
in
her
but
the
low
voice
in
her
ear
deterred
her
aunt
olivia
please
forgive
me
but
i
must
ask
you
to
come
away
with
me
just
for
five
minutes
please
in
a
temporarily
forsaken
angle
of
the
deck
georgiana
laid
her
case
before
her
aunt
speaking
with
rapid
shaken
words
but
none
the
less
determinedly
crofton
listened
with
an
astonished
face
and
with
lips
which
protested
even
before
they
had
the
chance
to
speak
i
know
just
how
dreadful
it
will
seem
to
you
all
that
i
should
have
known
my
duty
long
ago
but
i
see
it
now
oh
so
plainly
and
it
not
only
my
duty
it
my
love
that
takes
me
back
i
ca
stop
to
tell
you
how
i
feel
about
leaving
you
all
when
you
been
so
kind
so
wonderful
to
me
i
can
tell
you
that
another
time
but
the
thing
now
for
me
is
to
get
off
this
ship
before
it
sails
i
must
but
georgiana
my
dear
child
oh
please
do
try
to
keep
me
aunt
olivia
my
mind
is
made
up
i
ca
tell
you
how
it
hurts
to
do
it
but
i
do
dare
to
leave
my
father
if
anything
happened
to
him
i
could
never
forgive
myself
never
he
is
well
it
would
do
no
good
to
take
me
with
you
now
i
should
be
so
miserable
i
should
spoil
it
all
for
you
georgiana
listen
the
calmly
poised
woman
of
the
world
held
the
clinging
hand
in
a
firm
warm
grasp
the
low
voice
spoke
evenly
many
people
feel
just
as
you
do
dear
on
the
eve
of
sailing
some
are
made
actually
ill
even
quite
old
travelers
but
they
know
that
it
is
pure
hysteria
and
they
fight
it
off
and
afterward
they
are
able
to
laugh
at
their
fears
my
dear
you
are
quite
mistaken
about
there
being
any
danger
threatening
your
father
he
is
in
the
best
of
hands
and
he
himself
would
be
sadly
disappointed
it
was
of
no
use
crofton
took
her
niece
to
her
stateroom
and
sending
for
jeannette
and
rosalie
even
for
uncle
thomas
tried
in
vain
to
shake
her
ten
minutes
before
the
hour
of
sailing
rosalie
rushing
about
the
deck
in
search
of
miles
channing
finally
discovered
him
and
burst
out
under
her
breath
with
the
appalling
news
georgiana
going
back
she
got
the
idea
somehow
that
her
father
may
live
till
she
comes
home
we
ca
do
a
thing
with
her
oh
do
come
and
see
if
you
ca
show
her
how
absurd
it
is
to
do
such
a
thing
going
back
miles
channing
seized
rosalie
arm
where
is
she
why
she
ca
go
back
the
ship
all
but
casting
off
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
her
she
too
sensible
a
girl
to
lose
her
head
at
the
last
minute
good
heavens
we
wo
let
her
go
we
keep
her
in
her
stateroom
till
it
too
late
take
me
there
quick
they
dashed
along
the
narrow
passageways
until
coming
from
the
croftons
suite
they
encountered
georgiana
pale
but
quiet
jeannette
flushed
scarlet
and
in
tears
and
crofton
evidently
sorely
exasperated
but
keeping
herself
well
in
hand
channing
walked
straight
up
to
georgiana
will
you
give
me
five
minutes
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
with
a
faint
smile
it
no
use
channing
i
shall
not
change
my
mind
again
i
should
have
known
it
in
the
first
place
and
there
may
be
five
minutes
to
spare
i
must
be
in
sight
of
the
gangway
i
take
you
there
he
said
and
glanced
at
the
others
in
a
way
which
clearly
said
give
me
my
chance
they
understood
and
let
him
lead
georgiana
on
ahead
toward
the
place
she
sought
he
was
a
clever
man
and
an
experienced
one
in
the
ways
of
women
even
though
his
years
among
them
were
not
yet
many
he
realized
that
argument
was
of
little
use
there
was
only
one
weapon
left
with
which
to
fight
the
girl
determination
and
it
was
one
he
was
not
loath
to
use
though
he
had
not
meant
to
speak
so
plainly
until
quite
different
surroundings
invited
this
is
a
hard
blow
to
my
hopes
he
said
very
low
as
they
stood
where
they
could
watch
the
manoeuvres
of
the
officers
and
men
who
were
in
charge
of
the
embarkation
of
passengers
i
ca
tell
you
what
this
voyage
with
you
has
meant
to
me
i
do
know
how
to
give
it
up
now
please
listen
wo
you
do
this
come
across
with
us
and
then
when
you
are
actually
over
it
only
a
crossing
you
know
if
you
still
feel
you
must
go
back
we
not
try
to
prevent
you
you
be
away
then
only
a
fortnight
and
nothing
in
the
world
can
go
wrong
at
your
home
in
that
little
time
and
meanwhile
we
shall
have
had
this
voyage
together
georgiana
his
voice
with
its
meaning
inflections
would
have
been
very
hard
to
resist
if
the
girl
had
not
by
now
set
her
teeth
upon
her
determination
having
suffered
already
so
much
humiliation
for
the
sake
of
her
sudden
conviction
her
pride
would
not
have
let
her
change
again
though
a
voice
from
the
skies
had
then
and
there
assured
her
that
all
was
and
would
be
well
with
her
father
so
once
more
she
shook
her
head
and
moved
toward
the
gangway
behind
her
ready
to
follow
her
if
must
be
a
deckhand
waited
with
her
luggage
the
croftons
their
faces
showing
much
concern
had
remained
in
the
background
waiting
for
a
signal
from
channing
that
he
had
or
had
not
prevailed
if
you
go
ashore
threatened
channing
i
shall
go
with
you
and
the
ship
will
sail
without
me
this
roused
her
to
speech
no
no
do
even
say
such
a
thing
just
to
frighten
me
channing
and
i
truly
very
very
sorry
i
mean
it
he
urged
hotly
the
whole
thing
is
nothing
to
me
without
you
you
know
that
perfectly
well
i
should
never
forgive
you
she
said
turning
to
look
once
into
his
eyes
as
if
to
convince
him
of
the
reality
of
her
prohibition
and
he
saw
there
all
the
spirit
he
had
reckoned
with
and
saw
too
such
a
world
of
possibilities
for
one
who
could
arouse
that
intense
and
purposeful
nature
that
he
was
swept
off
his
feet
but
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
come
back
by
the
next
ship
he
said
quickly
no
not
if
you
come
a
day
sooner
than
you
intended
once
more
their
glances
met
like
blows
then
georgiana
moved
rapidly
toward
the
gangway
where
the
sailor
in
charge
was
beckoning
the
croftons
one
and
all
hurried
forward
and
the
retreating
traveler
suffered
their
embraces
my
child
you
are
forcing
us
to
leave
you
here
alone
to
look
after
yourself
after
our
promising
to
take
every
care
of
you
mourned
crofton
i
shall
be
most
uneasy
about
you
no
no
dear
aunt
olivia
you
must
be
i
am
a
perfectly
independent
person
and
i
can
take
myself
home
without
a
particle
of
trouble
and
please
please
forgive
me
all
of
you
she
was
off
at
last
with
jeannette
hot
tears
on
her
cheek
reproachful
and
all
but
angry
final
speech
i
did
think
actually
do
it
georgiana
warne
ringing
in
her
ears
and
explosive
derisive
prediction
following
her
by
thunder
but
you
be
a
sorry
girl
when
it
too
late
i
can
tell
you
that
to
make
her
feel
that
nobody
really
understood
or
sympathized
with
her
it
was
uncle
thomas
who
applied
the
one
touch
of
balm
to
his
sore
heart
david
warne
is
a
rich
man
my
dear
girl
to
have
you
he
said
gently
as
he
kissed
her
do
feel
too
badly
over
disappointing
us
it
all
right
take
good
care
of
yourself
going
home
and
give
my
love
to
your
father
she
smiled
bravely
back
at
him
as
she
ran
down
the
gangway
with
half
a
score
of
belated
visitors
to
the
ship
in
a
moment
she
was
only
one
of
the
crowd
of
people
who
were
watching
the
huge
bulk
of
the
liner
draw
almost
imperceptibly
away
from
the
pier
through
blurred
vision
she
looked
up
to
the
spot
where
they
were
all
waving
at
her
and
smiling
thank
heaven
they
were
smiling
as
it
was
obviously
their
duty
to
do
no
matter
what
their
feelings
when
their
faces
had
become
indistinguishable
and
the
great
ship
had
backed
far
out
into
the
waters
and
was
headed
toward
the
atlantic
georgiana
turned
to
a
porter
at
her
elbow
no
she
said
i
sail
yes
this
trunk
is
mine
it
to
go
back
somehow
as
she
followed
the
man
through
the
long
dingy
building
the
thing
which
drove
home
the
ache
in
her
heart
was
the
sight
of
the
little
steamer
trunk
uncle
thomas
gift
packed
with
so
many
high
hopes
now
riding
alone
on
a
great
truck
of
all
the
baggage
which
that
truck
had
borne
to
the
lading
of
the
ship
hers
was
the
only
little
lonely
piece
to
come
back
chapter
xvii
reaction
in
the
darkness
of
the
summer
midnight
georgiana
descended
from
the
owl
train
the
only
passenger
as
it
happened
to
alight
at
the
small
station
she
had
hoped
to
slip
away
unobserved
for
the
walk
home
but
the
station
master
was
too
quick
for
her
he
was
a
young
station
master
and
he
had
known
georgiana
warne
all
his
life
from
afar
well
i
certainly
did
think
i
seen
a
ghost
said
he
confronting
her
i
thought
you
gone
to
europe
get
a
message
to
come
back
your
father
ai
took
sick
has
he
no
i
hope
not
i
something
happened
to
make
it
best
for
me
to
come
back
well
that
too
bad
sure
said
he
curiously
regarding
her
say
wait
five
minutes
and
i
walk
down
the
road
with
you
it
pretty
late
for
you
to
be
out
alone
thank
you
parker
i
do
mind
a
bit
and
i
anxious
to
get
on
i
only
this
small
bag
to
carry
and
it
bright
moonlight
no
truly
please
do
come
and
thank
you
could
this
really
be
herself
georgiana
warne
she
wondered
as
she
made
her
escape
and
walked
rapidly
away
down
the
road
under
the
high
arches
of
the
elms
how
had
it
come
about
why
was
she
here
she
who
had
expected
to
be
out
on
the
first
reaches
of
the
great
deep
when
midnight
came
this
night
as
she
passed
silent
house
after
silent
house
familiar
and
yet
somehow
strangely
unfamiliar
in
the
light
of
what
might
have
been
it
was
hard
enough
to
realize
that
she
had
had
this
wonderful
chance
to
stay
away
for
two
happy
months
from
the
sober
little
old
place
and
had
herself
relinquished
it
before
she
knew
it
she
was
nearing
her
home
the
old
white
house
standing
square
and
stern
in
the
moonlight
she
had
been
seeing
it
all
the
way
in
the
train
she
loved
it
dearly
no
doubt
of
that
but
it
had
been
no
attack
of
homesickness
which
had
brought
her
back
to
it
as
she
came
up
the
path
she
saw
past
the
sweeping
branches
of
the
great
trees
which
surrounded
the
house
that
jefferson
windows
were
still
alight
this
was
no
surprise
for
she
knew
he
had
often
worked
till
late
hours
before
she
began
to
help
him
and
it
looked
as
if
now
that
he
had
to
continue
alone
he
meant
to
keep
up
the
rate
of
advance
by
working
overtime
georgiana
stole
upon
the
porch
and
tried
the
door
it
was
bolted
as
usual
she
slipped
around
the
house
and
tried
the
side
and
rear
doors
in
turn
to
find
them
fast
she
had
had
no
plan
as
to
how
to
make
an
undisturbing
entrance
at
this
hour
but
had
counted
on
being
able
to
discover
some
unguarded
point
she
and
her
father
had
never
been
careful
as
to
thorough
locking
of
the
house
in
a
neighbourhood
where
thefts
were
almost
unknown
but
evidently
their
boarder
accustomed
to
city
ways
and
chances
of
trouble
had
taken
pains
to
make
all
fast
there
seemed
to
be
only
one
thing
to
do
and
georgiana
did
it
after
all
it
was
probably
better
that
somebody
should
know
of
her
return
in
case
she
had
to
go
about
the
house
and
make
any
betraying
sounds
she
stooped
to
the
gravel
path
and
scooping
up
a
handful
of
pebbles
flung
them
up
at
one
of
the
lighted
windows
where
they
rattled
like
small
bird
shot
upon
the
wire
netting
of
the
screen
it
took
a
second
fusillade
before
the
absorbed
worker
within
was
attracted
and
appeared
at
the
window
a
black
figure
against
the
yellow
radiance
of
the
oil
lamp
it
some
one
who
belongs
here
georgiana
called
softly
please
come
down
very
quietly
and
let
me
in
wait
a
minute
returned
the
voice
above
in
less
than
that
minute
the
door
swung
softly
open
and
the
tall
figure
clad
in
loose
shirt
and
trousers
the
former
open
at
the
neck
and
revealing
a
sturdy
throat
stood
before
the
applicant
for
admission
there
was
no
light
upon
georgiana
for
the
moonlit
yard
was
behind
her
what
can
i
do
for
you
jefferson
was
beginning
in
a
pleasant
tone
as
of
one
not
at
all
disturbed
by
being
summoned
at
this
hour
when
a
voice
he
had
heard
many
times
before
said
with
an
odd
thrill
in
it
as
if
it
struggled
between
tears
and
laughter
you
can
let
me
in
and
try
not
to
consider
me
an
idiot
i
got
my
father
on
my
mind
and
could
sail
so
i
came
back
that
absolutely
all
there
is
of
it
my
dear
girl
jefferson
put
forth
a
hand
and
took
hers
as
he
came
out
upon
the
porch
of
course
i
beg
your
pardon
he
added
releasing
her
hand
after
one
strong
pressure
if
you
consider
that
my
rather
natural
surprise
is
apology
enough
but
you
ca
mean
that
the
ship
and
the
party
have
sailed
without
you
just
that
is
is
my
father
as
well
as
he
was
this
morning
he
was
quite
as
well
apparently
at
bedtime
the
heat
has
been
trying
but
he
has
borne
it
without
complaint
i
do
know
what
i
expected
confessed
georgiana
rather
faintly
but
i
do
think
i
expected
that
i
very
thankful
i
come
in
and
slip
upstairs
thank
you
for
coming
down
she
would
stay
for
no
more
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
bear
no
further
explanations
as
if
he
understood
her
jefferson
was
silent
as
he
followed
her
in
bolted
the
heavy
door
and
took
from
her
the
handbag
she
carried
he
deposited
this
at
the
door
of
her
room
upstairs
and
spoke
under
his
breath
in
the
darkness
relieved
only
by
the
rays
which
shone
from
the
open
door
of
his
own
room
at
the
front
of
the
hall
and
welcome
back
it
was
almost
daylight
when
she
fell
asleep
and
she
wakened
again
at
the
first
sound
of
perkins
footsteps
in
the
kitchen
below
her
she
dressed
slowly
her
heart
heavy
with
the
sense
of
having
made
a
probably
needless
sacrifice
with
the
waking
in
the
familiar
old
room
all
the
realization
of
that
which
she
had
lost
had
come
heavily
upon
her
why
was
not
the
sunlight
pouring
in
through
portholes
bearing
the
refreshing
breezes
from
the
sea
instead
of
beating
in
over
the
hot
tin
roof
of
the
ell
upon
which
her
windows
looked
was
it
merely
as
aunt
olivia
had
warned
her
the
hysteria
of
the
inexperienced
traveler
why
had
she
not
at
least
accepted
miles
channing
eminently
reasonable
suggestion
that
she
make
the
voyage
giving
her
emotions
time
to
cool
at
the
longest
if
she
made
an
immediate
return
she
would
have
been
absent
but
little
more
than
a
fortnight
but
she
dressed
with
unusual
care
none
the
less
and
when
she
descended
the
back
stairs
she
was
looking
as
fresh
and
trim
as
ever
in
her
life
she
encountered
the
good
perkins
in
the
kitchen
and
had
it
out
with
her
receiving
the
first
encouragement
she
had
felt
that
somebody
would
think
her
rational
in
her
return
well
i
must
say
declared
that
lady
standing
still
as
if
she
had
been
struck
in
an
attitude
of
astonishment
while
i
more
than
sorry
for
you
to
lose
your
trip
georgie
i
shall
feel
safer
now
you
back
your
father
does
look
awful
peaked
to
me
and
kind
of
more
so
than
i
ever
noticed
before
perhaps
it
just
because
i
felt
the
responsibility
settlin
down
on
my
shoulders
the
minute
you
was
out
of
the
house
and
i
guess
he
was
goin
to
miss
you
pretty
awful
much
though
of
course
he
would
say
so
georgiana
took
in
her
father
tray
when
it
was
ready
quite
as
usual
her
heart
beating
fast
as
she
entered
and
beheld
the
white
face
against
the
pillows
after
the
first
gasp
of
surprise
she
saw
the
unwonted
colour
flow
into
the
pale
cheeks
my
dear
dear
child
he
said
as
she
set
down
the
tray
and
flew
to
clasp
him
in
her
arms
this
is
this
is
almost
more
than
i
can
grasp
what
has
happened
is
the
sailing
of
your
ship
deferred
my
sailing
on
it
is
deferred
she
told
him
i
could
leave
you
father
davy
that
the
simple
truth
your
daughter
is
an
she
did
not
try
to
make
it
clear
to
him
but
let
him
guess
the
most
of
her
reason
for
returning
and
was
rewarded
by
his
fervent
well
dear
it
was
a
very
wonderful
thing
for
you
to
do
but
you
should
not
have
done
it
you
should
have
trusted
the
good
lord
to
take
care
of
me
as
i
bade
you
you
must
do
it
yet
we
will
arrange
for
you
to
follow
your
uncle
thomas
party
on
the
next
boat
i
can
not
have
you
lose
so
much
just
for
me
it
no
use
she
asserted
her
eyes
studying
the
blue
veins
so
clearly
outlined
on
the
fair
forehead
i
made
my
decision
i
ought
to
have
made
it
that
way
in
the
beginning
so
long
as
you
need
me
i
shall
not
leave
you
at
the
breakfast
table
she
met
jefferson
it
was
only
hours
since
she
and
he
had
breakfasted
together
but
somehow
it
seemed
to
georgiana
as
if
at
least
a
week
had
gone
by
warne
was
seldom
present
at
the
first
meal
of
the
day
and
it
had
come
to
seem
very
natural
to
georgiana
to
sit
down
with
her
boarder
and
pour
his
coffee
and
talk
with
him
this
morning
however
there
was
a
curious
constraint
in
the
girl
manner
after
the
first
interchange
of
observations
on
the
promise
of
even
more
extreme
heat
than
on
the
preceding
day
and
the
possibilities
of
dress
and
diet
to
suit
the
trying
conditions
the
talk
flagged
i
am
strongly
tempted
said
jefferson
as
he
rose
after
making
an
unusually
frugal
meal
of
fruit
and
coffee
to
let
up
on
work
till
there
comes
a
change
in
the
weather
i
believe
i
shall
try
how
it
feels
to
idle
a
little
you
surely
will
indorse
that
miss
warne
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
no
she
said
quickly
sure
that
this
plan
was
the
result
of
consideration
for
herself
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
should
much
prefer
to
work
i
am
sure
you
can
give
me
something
to
do
even
if
you
are
not
working
yourself
do
you
mean
that
then
if
you
do
i
shall
be
with
you
though
i
think
it
would
be
good
for
you
to
rest
this
last
week
has
been
pretty
full
for
you
even
though
you
have
been
with
me
on
the
book
she
shook
her
head
i
want
to
go
on
with
it
she
insisted
and
he
agreed
news
in
a
small
village
travels
fast
and
georgiana
was
fully
prepared
to
have
james
stuart
appear
with
the
first
fall
of
dusk
he
came
through
the
hedge
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
and
found
her
on
the
seat
under
the
old
apple
tree
which
was
her
favourite
resort
his
greeting
was
full
of
the
astonishment
which
had
been
his
all
day
my
word
george
but
i
never
would
have
believed
this
how
on
earth
did
you
come
to
do
it
i
had
to
she
said
simply
and
rather
wearily
she
had
explained
to
at
least
twenty
persons
that
day
as
well
as
she
could
explain
she
was
not
willing
to
confide
to
any
one
the
incident
of
the
flowers
and
the
card
which
had
brought
about
the
impulse
to
return
that
had
hardened
so
quickly
into
action
she
had
listened
to
all
kinds
of
comments
on
the
situation
some
few
sympathetic
but
most
of
them
curious
and
critical
many
had
said
to
her
that
they
never
would
have
believed
georgie
warne
would
ever
change
her
mind
about
anything
others
had
added
that
perhaps
it
was
a
good
thing
since
her
father
certainly
was
pretty
feeble
and
nobody
knew
when
he
might
take
a
turn
for
the
worse
altogether
it
had
not
been
a
happy
day
for
the
object
of
the
village
interest
stuart
sat
down
beside
georgiana
on
the
old
bench
which
bore
his
initials
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
it
the
earliest
ones
hacked
out
during
his
small
boyhood
the
later
more
than
once
coupling
with
his
own
his
hand
as
he
settled
into
place
rested
on
one
of
these
very
monograms
it
seems
like
the
natural
thing
to
say
i
glad
to
see
you
back
he
said
slowly
but
there
a
reason
why
i
ca
say
it
at
all
then
do
dream
of
saying
it
georgiana
leaned
her
head
listlessly
against
the
seamy
old
tree
trunk
behind
her
it
not
that
i
wanted
you
to
go
you
know
i
was
altogether
too
selfish
for
that
he
went
on
but
something
happened
at
the
last
that
made
me
entirely
reconciled
to
having
you
go
can
you
guess
what
it
was
possibly
but
you
ca
of
course
i
was
pretty
well
dashed
at
finding
channing
booked
for
the
trip
but
i
got
over
that
when
i
made
up
my
mind
to
come
too
to
come
too
the
head
resting
against
the
tree
trunk
turned
quickly
what
you
mean
jeannette
suggested
it
said
he
with
something
in
his
voice
which
his
listener
could
not
quite
analyze
she
put
it
up
to
me
to
come
over
while
they
should
be
staying
in
devonshire
and
join
their
house
party
at
first
i
said
i
could
but
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
it
seemed
possible
to
get
over
there
for
a
fortnight
anyhow
the
plan
was
not
to
tell
you
and
to
surprise
you
by
walking
in
on
you
georgiana
stared
at
him
as
well
as
she
could
see
him
through
the
fervid
twilight
jimps
why
how
could
you
get
away
there
never
a
time
when
it
easy
to
get
away
he
admitted
but
everything
in
full
sail
now
for
the
summer
and
just
lately
succeeded
in
getting
hold
of
an
awfully
competent
man
who
could
run
things
for
the
month
well
enough
anyhow
of
course
i
was
dippy
at
the
thought
of
going
and
i
promised
her
i
would
if
i
could
manage
it
never
had
the
chance
to
travel
much
and
it
suddenly
struck
me
that
i
did
have
to
deny
myself
every
possible
thing
but
of
course
now
that
you
back
but
that
makes
no
difference
she
cried
quickly
why
should
it
jeannette
asked
you
because
she
wanted
you
of
course
you
must
go
if
you
really
can
get
away
she
never
would
have
asked
me
if
you
had
been
going
and
it
was
only
an
afterthought
then
if
i
had
gone
on
for
that
last
hour
it
have
occurred
to
her
it
occurred
to
her
to
wish
it
because
she
said
so
more
than
once
to
me
the
day
i
was
there
but
she
did
dream
you
could
do
it
i
do
know
why
we
should
all
consider
you
a
fixture
for
your
father
is
much
stronger
than
mine
and
it
could
harm
him
at
all
to
spare
you
for
a
little
of
course
you
must
go
jimps
when
will
you
start
do
you
honestly
want
me
to
go
george
he
seemed
to
be
scanning
her
face
through
the
dimness
i
should
be
a
selfish
thing
enough
if
i
did
she
protested
he
was
silent
for
a
minute
then
he
said
to
be
frank
i
wrote
last
night
for
a
berth
on
a
ship
that
sails
in
two
weeks
jeannette
warned
me
not
to
delay
the
travel
is
so
heavy
this
time
of
year
i
talked
it
over
with
my
father
and
he
seemed
pleased
at
the
idea
you
can
imagine
i
felt
a
bit
dizzy
this
morning
when
i
heard
you
had
sailed
i
believe
it
at
first
never
mind
you
will
go
just
the
same
and
all
the
more
it
a
pity
somebody
should
carry
out
the
plan
and
you
had
less
fun
than
i
for
you
been
at
home
longer
since
college
go
jimps
and
take
the
goods
the
gods
provide
she
maintained
this
spirit
throughout
the
ensuing
fortnight
in
spite
of
his
evident
effort
to
make
her
acknowledge
that
she
would
feel
her
own
disappointment
the
more
for
his
going
when
he
came
over
to
say
he
found
her
apparently
in
the
gayest
of
spirits
and
she
gave
him
such
a
friendly
that
he
went
away
marvelling
in
his
heart
at
the
ways
of
young
women
and
the
ways
of
georgiana
warne
in

chapter
xviii
steady
on
on
the
day
following
the
departure
of
james
stuart
for
england
while
the
two
literary
workmen
were
hard
at
it
in
the
old
manse
study
the
july
weather
having
mercifully
turned
decidedly
cooler
for
a
space
the
village
telegraph
messenger
a
tall
youth
with
a
shambling
gait
appeared
with
a
message
for
jefferson
georgiana
brought
it
to
him
and
waited
to
know
whether
there
was
a
reply
she
saw
the
message
evidently
a
long
one
twice
read
and
noticed
a
peculiar
lighting
of
the
grave
face
which
had
bent
over
it
jefferson
wrote
an
answer
briefer
than
the
message
received
and
himself
took
it
to
the
waiting
boy
when
he
returned
he
sat
down
and
began
to
put
in
order
the
papers
on
which
he
had
been
working
i
have
another
trade
as
you
have
guessed
he
said
to
georgiana
it
seems
necessary
for
me
to
go
away
and
work
at
it
for
a
few
days
perhaps
a
fortnight
it
is
fortunate
for
me
that
you
are
here
for
i
should
not
have
felt
that
i
ought
to
leave
your
father
and
yet
i
should
hardly
have
been
able
to
refuse
the
call
of
that
message
then
i
am
very
glad
she
returned
that
i
am
here
can
you
leave
me
work
to
do
i
am
afraid
not
beyond
that
already
laid
out
for
wo
you
rest
while
i
am
gone
this
is
vacation
time
for
most
people
you
know
she
shook
her
head
with
only
father
to
look
after
i
shall
have
little
enough
to
do
you
wo
forgive
me
go
up
into
that
blistering
attic
and
make
rugs
i
hope
not
she
felt
that
he
was
looking
keenly
at
her
why
should
you
hope
not
i
am
one
of
the
people
who
must
be
busy
to
be
contented
how
soon
do
you
go
mr
jefferson
on
the
noon
train
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
have
an
hour
to
make
ready
no
do
go
i
will
come
back
when
i
am
ready
and
we
will
put
things
in
shape
to
leave
so
that
we
shall
know
exactly
where
to
take
them
up
again
in
half
an
hour
he
was
back
and
together
the
two
put
the
results
of
their
joint
work
into
such
shape
that
at
a
moment
notice
they
might
resume
it
this
done
they
went
to
warne
and
the
intending
traveler
explained
briefly
the
situation
without
as
georgiana
fully
realized
explaining
it
at
all
then
shortly
he
went
away
with
something
in
his
manner
which
subtly
told
her
that
he
was
very
glad
to
go
and
that
he
was
thinking
of
little
besides
the
errand
which
took
him
from
them
careful
though
he
was
in
every
courteous
detail
of
when
he
had
gone
georgiana
and
her
father
looked
at
each
other
daughter
said
warne
looking
intently
at
the
vivid
face
with
the
eyes
which
saw
so
many
things
do
you
know
what
you
remind
me
of
no
father
davy
of
a
cross
child
of
a
young
colt
penned
into
a
very
small
enclosure
with
only
one
lame
and
blind
old
horse
to
keep
it
company
and
within
sight
off
on
the
hillside
is
a
great
green
pasture
with
other
colts
and
lambs
sporting
gayly
about
and
the
summer
sunshine
over
all
except
in
the
corral
over
which
a
dark
cloud
hangs
and
i
am
sorry
sorry
father
davy
georgiana
choked
back
a
lump
in
her
throat
but
it
is
hot
july
and
the
cloud
makes
it
cooler
and
nicer
in
the
corral
and
besides
the
lame
blind
horse
is
such
a
dear
has
drawn
such
heavy
loads
and
would
be
so
lonely
now
without
company
and
and
the
colt
has
many
long
years
to
sport
on
hillsides
warne
smiled
more
sadly
than
was
his
wont
but
not
while
it
is
a
colt
then
after
a
pause
my
dear
we
shall
miss
mr
jefferson
shall
we
i
shall
miss
him
more
than
i
should
have
realized
till
i
saw
him
go
down
the
path
and
james
stuart
too
that
is
why
i
know
that
you
will
miss
them
we
shall
live
through
it
prophesied
his
daughter
cheerfully
and
betook
herself
to
the
kitchen
which
she
found
looking
in
spite
of
its
neatness
more
like
a
jail
than
ever
before
the
following
days
went
by
on
feet
of
lead
never
had
georgiana
had
to
make
such
an
effort
to
maintain
ordinary
everyday
cheerfulness
and
patience
she
found
herself
longing
with
one
continuous
dull
ache
from
morning
till
night
for
something
to
happen
something
which
would
absorb
her
every
faculty
she
rose
early
and
went
for
long
walks
and
went
again
in
the
late
afternoons
with
the
one
purpose
of
tiring
her
vigorous
young
body
so
that
it
would
keep
her
restless
mind
in
order
she
worked
at
her
many
hours
spent
many
more
in
reading
aloud
to
her
father
and
still
there
were
hours
left
to
fill
she
forced
herself
to
go
to
see
all
her
acquaintances
to
visit
those
few
who
were
ill
there
was
nobody
in
want
in
the
whole
place
it
seemed
in
this
summer
prosperity
of
garden
there
nothing
to
do
for
any
one
she
said
to
her
father
one
day
i
feel
guilty
times
without
number
because
i
not
of
more
use
to
the
people
about
me
her
father
studied
her
dear
he
said
slowly
what
you
need
just
now
is
something
the
good
father
knows
you
need
and
i
believe
he
will
not
deny
it
to
you
in
the
meantime
remember
that
simply
being
cheerful
and
patient
under
enforced
waiting
is
sometimes
the
greatest
service
that
can
be
rendered
if
you
have
taught
me
that
it
is
because
you
have
illustrated
it
every
day
of
your
life
she
cried
and
fled
in
her
own
room
she
beat
her
strong
young
hands
together
oh
dear
god
she
said
aloud
if
i
could
only
only
have
the
thing
i
want
i
would
take
anything
that
might
go
with
it
and
not
complain
and
then
suddenly
one
early
august
night
jefferson
returned
he
came
up
the
path
bag
in
hand
and
saw
a
solitary
figure
standing
on
the
small
front
porch
where
a
latticework
sheltered
opposing
seats
it
was
a
white
figure
in
the
early
dusk
and
it
rose
as
he
approached
the
fortnight
is
not
quite
up
said
georgiana
quietly
but
i
put
your
room
in
order
hoping
you
would
come
my
father
never
missed
anybody
so
much
that
sounds
very
pleasant
he
set
down
his
bag
and
shook
hands
it
makes
it
the
harder
to
say
that
i
must
be
off
again
in
the
morning
and
i
shall
not
be
coming
back
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
could
not
leave
without
seeing
you
and
warne
i
should
have
sent
on
to
ask
you
to
pack
and
send
my
trunk
really
how
very
unexpected
but
i
would
gladly
have
sent
on
the
trunk
said
georgiana
something
cold
clutched
at
her
heart
would
you
that
sounds
rather
inhospitable
do
you
care
to
hear
my
plans
if
you
care
to
tell
them
mr
jefferson
i
wonder
said
he
if
you
would
be
willing
to
go
around
to
the
other
porch
and
sit
there
i
have
a
fancy
for
being
where
i
can
get
the
scent
from
your
garden
i
shall
miss
that
spicy
fragrance
is
your
father
still
up
he
has
just
gone
to
bed
he
would
be
very
happy
if
you
would
go
in
and
speak
to
him
said
georgiana
jefferson
ran
upstairs
with
his
bag
and
made
a
brief
call
upon
warne
then
he
came
down
to
find
georgiana
standing
with
her
arms
about
a
white
pillar
her
face
looking
off
toward
the
garden
the
lamplight
from
the
central
hall
whose
rear
door
opened
upon
the
porch
gleamed
rosily
out
upon
her
jefferson
came
out
and
stood
beside
her
i
came
back
he
said
just
to
offer
you
my
friendship
in
any
time
of
need
i
could
go
away
without
doing
that
i
could
be
content
merely
to
write
it
back
to
you
i
have
lived
here
in
your
home
with
your
father
and
yourself
until
it
has
come
to
seem
almost
as
if
i
belonged
here
but
my
work
calls
me
i
must
go
back
to
it
the
book
must
wait
to
be
finished
in
spare
moments
as
other
books
have
been
finished
i
thought
i
could
give
myself
this
year
away
from
my
profession
to
accomplish
this
task
and
perhaps
to
lay
in
fresh
stores
of
energy
but
i
find
i
ca
be
easy
in
mind
to
do
this
longer
so
i
am
going
back
after
an
instant
georgiana
answered
without
turning
her
eyes
away
from
the
garden
you
are
a
very
fortunate
person
to
have
work
that
calls
so
loudly
i
am
sure
of
that
and
it
is
work
which
absorbs
me
to
the
full
but
i
shall
always
have
time
to
give
to
you
or
to
your
father
if
in
any
way
i
can
ever
be
of
service
to
you
i
have
no
family
to
call
upon
me
for
any
attention
whatever
i
have
no
near
relative
except
the
married
sister
who
lives
abroad
as
i
have
told
you
by
the
way
allison
has
bidden
me
more
than
once
to
thank
you
for
her
for
taking
such
good
care
of
me
you
know
her
by
her
picture
if
you
have
noticed
it
the
one
on
my
bureau
georgiana
nodded
she
did
not
trust
her
lips
which
were
suddenly
trembling
to
tell
him
that
though
he
had
often
spoken
of
this
sister
he
had
never
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
photograph
on
his
bureau
was
hers
but
what
did
it
matter
now
it
was
far
better
that
she
had
not
known
that
she
had
had
this
restraint
upon
her
imagination
to
keep
her
from
ever
letting
herself
go
it
was
far
better
but
he
was
speaking
she
must
listen
while
i
have
been
in
this
house
i
have
felt
he
was
saying
as
if
i
had
a
real
home
it
is
hard
to
give
that
up
association
with
your
father
has
become
much
to
me
i
ca
tell
you
what
he
has
given
me
out
of
his
stores
of
wisdom
and
experience
and
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
i
shall
not
forget
it
i
have
done
nothing
murmured
georgiana
with
dry
lips
except
feed
you
and
dust
your
room
you
might
have
had
such
service
anywhere
might
i
i
doubt
it
and
there
is
something
else
if
i
may
i
should
like
to
tell
you
how
i
have
admired
you
for
your
steady
facing
of
each
day
routine
there
is
no
heroism
in
the
world
miss
georgiana
equal
to
that
to
my
thinking
she
shook
her
head
i
not
heroic
please
do
tell
me
i
am
but
you
are
and
i
must
tell
you
so
why
not
i
have
seen
more
than
you
may
have
realized
my
whole
life
training
has
been
in
the
line
of
observation
of
other
human
beings
and
you
must
know
that
no
one
could
be
with
you
and
not
understand
that
the
fires
of
longing
to
live
and
live
strongly
and
vitally
burn
in
you
with
more
than
ordinary
fierceness
yet
you
subdue
them
every
day
for
the
sake
of
the
one
who
needs
you
that
is
real
heroism
and
the
sight
of
it
has
touched
me
very
much
suddenly
she
found
herself
struggling
to
keep
back
the
choking
in
her
throat
how
well
he
had
understood
her
and
what
unsuspected
depths
of
tenderness
there
were
in
his
rich
and
quiet
voice
she
could
not
speak
for
a
little
and
he
stood
beside
her
in
a
comprehending
silence
i
ca
go
away
he
said
presently
without
telling
you
that
your
happiness
has
come
to
seem
very
important
to
me
i
have
necessarily
a
fairly
wide
knowledge
of
men
their
characters
their
motives
their
ideals
or
their
lack
of
them
miss
georgiana
when
you
come
to
choose
will
you
let
me
say
it
do
be
misled
by
superficial
attributes
even
the
most
attractive
do
let
the
desire
to
have
your
horizon
apparently
expanded
to
go
far
and
see
much
and
live
intensely
overbalance
your
appreciation
of
fine
and
lasting
qualities
in
one
who
could
give
you
little
excitement
but
much
that
is
real
and
worth
having
it
may
be
very
daring
in
me
to
say
this
to
you
but
i
find
myself
impelled
to
it
i
want
you
to
live
and
live
gloriously
and
find
employment
for
every
one
of
your
splendid
energies
and
there
is
only
one
being
in
the
world
who
can
help
you
do
that
the
man
whom
you
can
respect
as
well
as
love
and
love
as
well
as
respect
will
you
promise
me
to
choose
him
and
nobody
else
she
turned
suddenly
and
fiercely
upon
him
how
can
you
think
i
she
stopped
short
her
eyes
blazing
in
the
darkness
i
can
foresee
said
he
very
gently
an
hour
for
you
when
you
will
be
tempted
out
of
your
senses
to
do
the
thing
which
promises
change
any
change
you
are
starving
for
it
you
are
desperate
with
longing
for
it
jefferson
miles
channing
came
into
town
when
i
did
his
car
raced
my
train
for
the
last
two
miles
he
has
gone
to
the
hotel
doubtless
you
will
see
him
within
the
hour
miss
georgiana
i
ca
let
you
marry
him
without
telling
you
that
if
you
do
you
will
be
an
unhappy
woman
for
the
rest
of
your
life
she
was
speechless
for
a
moment
with
surprise
she
forgot
her
encounter
with
the
speaker
in
her
astonishment
at
his
news
channing
had
come
back
then
even
as
he
had
vowed
long
before
the
rest
of
the
party
the
knowledge
that
he
was
close
at
hand
again
bringing
back
with
him
such
a
wild
will
to
accomplish
that
of
which
he
had
been
thwarted
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
brook
delay
upon
the
other
side
of
the
water
was
knowledge
of
the
sort
which
stopped
the
breath
will
you
forgive
me
said
jefferson
low
voice
in
her
ear
but
but
i
do
understand
she
stammered
and
now
at
last
she
showed
him
her
unhappy
eyes
what
i
have
to
do
with
it
how
can
i
fail
to
have
something
to
do
with
it
when
i
let
you
sail
in
the
same
party
with
this
young
man
without
warning
you
it
was
because
i
had
no
possible
notion
that
he
was
to
be
along
when
i
learned
that
he
had
gone
and
that
he
had
followed
you
back
i
knew
that
he
was
in
earnest
at
least
in
his
pursuit
of
you
i
had
thought
there
was
no
actual
danger
for
you
on
account
of
your
friend
your
real
friend
the
young
man
whom
you
had
known
and
trusted
so
long
and
with
such
reason
but
now
with
him
away
and
you
alone
here
and
lonely
and
full
of
the
hunger
for
life
yes
i
know
i
am
speaking
plainly
but
i
feel
that
i
must
put
you
on
your
guard
and
i
want
you
to
feel
that
though
i
shall
be
gone
night
i
am
here
and
if
you
have
any
need
for
me
for
an
elder
brother
oh
how
can
you
think
i
do
think
and
i
know
and
i
fear
for
you
not
because
i
do
not
believe
in
you
but
because
i
know
the
manner
of
man
who
will
approach
you
you
have
never
known
his
sort
let
me
be
a
brother
to
you
just
for
if
only
in
your
thought
it
may
help
to
steady
you
there
was
silence
between
them
for
a
little
then
steps
upon
the
front
porch
quick
ringing
steps
as
of
one
who
comes
with
eagerness
georgiana
felt
her
hand
taken
for
an
instant
and
pressed
warmly
between
two
firm
hands
then
her
companion
left
her
three
hours
afterward
georgiana
flung
herself
breathing
fast
upon
her
knees
beside
her
open
window
and
lifted
her
face
toward
the
sky
she
would
have
fled
to
her
garden
for
this
vigil
she
must
keep
but
the
extraordinary
truth
was
that
she
did
not
dare
be
alone
there
her
hands
gripped
the
sill
her
eyes
stared
without
seeing
at
the
vaulted
depths
above
her
after
a
long
time
hours
she
rose
and
went
to
her
door
opened
it
without
making
a
sound
and
listening
till
she
had
made
sure
that
the
house
was
as
silent
as
all
houses
should
be
at
two
in
the
morning
she
stole
slowly
along
the
upper
hall
presently
she
stood
outside
the
closed
door
of
the
guest
who
was
sleeping
under
the
roof
for
the
last
time
with
a
heart
she
noiselessly
laid
her
hand
upon
the
panel
of
that
door
you
did
steady
me
she
whispered
i
could
have
done
it
if
you
had
warned
me
fortified
me
oh
what
shall
i
do
without
you
inside
suddenly
a
footstep
sounded
the
footstep
of
a
shod
foot
instantly
the
girl
was
off
down
the
hall
like
a
frightened
deer
in
her
own
room
she
stood
with
her
hand
upon
her
breast
up
at
this
hour
her
startled
consciousness
was
repeating
why
there
was
no
light
in
his
room
could
he
sleep
either
why
is
what
it
means
to
him
to
be
a
brother
in
the
morning
jefferson
took
his
leave
his
parting
with
warne
was
like
that
between
father
and
son
when
he
came
to
georgiana
he
looked
straight
down
into
her
eyes
remember
he
said
that
what
i
have
told
you
of
my
wish
to
be
of
any
possible
use
to
you
and
your
father
holds
good
even
though
i
should
be
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
i
shall
write
now
and
then
to
ask
about
you
both
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
hope
for
your
happiness
georgiana
when
he
had
gone
she
went
to
her
room
and
dropped
upon
her
knees
beside
her
bed
her
arms
outflung
upon
the
old
blue
and
white
counterpane
o
god
she
whispered
passionately
how
could
you
show
it
to
me
if
i
could
have
it
how
you
chapter
xix
revelations
summer
had
gone
at
last
its
fierce
heat
giving
way
to
the
cool
fresh
days
of
an
early
autumn
august
september
october
the
months
had
dragged
interminably
by
and
now
it
was
november
bleak
and
chill
with
gray
skies
and
penetrating
winds
and
sudden
deluges
of
rain
georgiana
sweeping
sodden
leaves
from
a
wet
porch
after
an
storm
looked
up
to
see
the
village
telegraph
messenger
approaching
with
her
one
dearest
safe
upon
a
couch
within
and
stuart
long
since
at
home
again
she
could
not
fear
bad
news
she
thought
of
jeannette
who
was
always
in
the
absence
of
a
telephone
in
the
old
manse
telegraphing
her
invitations
and
demands
she
tore
open
the
dispatch
with
a
hope
that
it
was
from
jeannette
for
she
had
sadly
missed
her
letters
jeannette
indeed
it
was
who
had
inspired
the
message
but
its
sender
was
her
sister
rosalie
crofton
wired
that
jeannette
had
been
taken
suddenly
and
violently
ill
while
on
a
visit
in
new
york
and
was
to
be
operated
upon
at
once
that
she
had
begged
georgiana
to
come
and
to
bring
james
stuart
with
her
that
rosalie
herself
was
dreadfully
frightened
and
prayed
georgiana
not
to
lose
a
train
nor
to
fail
to
bring
stuart
action
was
never
slow
with
the
receiver
of
this
message
it
had
never
been
quicker
than
now
with
one
brief
explanation
to
her
father
she
was
off
to
find
stuart
just
at
the
dripping
hedge
she
met
him
his
face
tense
with
the
shock
it
was
plain
he
had
received
at
sight
of
her
he
drew
a
yellow
paper
from
his
pocket
you
heard
he
cried
yes
this
very
minute
there
only
an
hour
to
catch
the
you
go
of
course
i
was
coming
to
tell
you
i
be
ready
she
turned
again
and
ran
back
there
was
much
to
do
in
the
allotted
hour
but
with
the
help
of
perkins
she
accomplished
it
when
she
and
stuart
were
in
the
train
sitting
side
by
side
in
the
ordinary
coach
of
the
traveler
who
must
conserve
his
resources
as
georgiana
had
decreed
stuart
spoke
the
first
word
of
comment
upon
the
situation
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
he
said
after
that
telegram
of
course
not
agreed
georgiana
simply
she
was
perfectly
well
last
week
said
stuart
was
she
you
know
i
have
seen
her
since
they
came
back
she
said
she
had
tried
every
way
to
get
you
there
she
has
i
was
going
when
i
could
you
know
father
has
been
as
well
since
they
came
back
in
september
i
know
but
she
wanted
to
see
you
she
says
she
ca
write
half
so
well
as
she
can
talk
no
one
ca
there
was
silence
for
some
time
after
this
exchange
stuart
seemed
restless
stirred
often
once
got
up
and
stood
for
a
long
time
at
the
rear
of
the
car
staring
back
at
the
wet
tracks
slipping
away
behind
when
they
had
changed
trains
and
were
headed
for
new
york
with
their
destination
only
a
few
hours
away
stuart
again
in
the
vestibule
of
the
car
looking
out
through
the
closed
entrance
door
upon
a
dull
landscape
passing
like
a
misty
wraith
through
the
november
fog
and
twilight
found
georgiana
at
his
elbow
jimps
she
was
saying
in
her
straightforward
way
what
the
use
of
bothering
to
keep
it
covered
when
it
shows
so
plainly
do
you
think
i
do
understand
i
do
and
it
absolutely
all
right
he
turned
quickly
and
his
gloomy
eyes
stared
down
into
her
uplifted
face
o
george
he
muttered
can
you
honestly
say
that
honestly
i
know
how
it
happened
you
could
help
it
it
was
meant
to
be
the
other
was
that
all
there
is
of
it
i
been
feeling
such
a
sneak
why
should
you
i
told
you
over
and
over
i
know
you
have
but
that
last
time
that
was
really
the
beginning
of
this
other
said
she
with
decision
you
were
not
yourself
and
you
did
know
just
why
you
thought
it
must
be
because
you
cared
for
me
but
it
was
the
stirring
of
your
first
real
feeling
for
any
woman
only
you
did
recognize
it
that
the
whole
thing
jimps
and
you
are
not
to
reproach
yourself
particularly
now
when
she
faltered
suddenly
and
he
drew
a
quick
breath
that
was
as
if
something
stabbed
him
after
a
little
he
began
very
slowly
it
did
really
happen
till
devonshire
those
two
weeks
i
ca
tell
you
no
mortal
man
could
have
resisted
her
yet
i
tried
i
did
george
she
did
know
about
you
she
never
has
except
that
we
were
old
friends
and
dear
ones
she
thinks
the
trouble
is
that
she
a
rich
man
daughter
and
i
only
a
farmer
you
no
ordinary
farmer
and
she
knows
it
her
family
know
it
and
if
she
wants
you
she
have
you
they
never
refused
her
anything
i
have
asked
her
james
stuart
it
was
her
old
tone
with
him
for
the
moment
both
forgot
the
possible
issue
of
this
errand
upon
which
they
were
going
only
the
vital
relations
at
stake
seemed
involved
but
she
knows
said
stuart
very
low
of
course
she
does
by
and
by
stuart
spoke
again
george
you
were
never
quite
so
close
to
me
as
now
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
i
stay
close
dear
and
i
do
all
i
can
for
you
both
this
was
all
they
said
until
the
first
lights
of
the
great
city
miles
out
were
flashing
past
them
then
it
occurred
to
georgiana
to
put
a
startled
question
jimps
have
you
any
address
to
go
to
there
was
none
in
my
telegram
i
know
where
they
are
staying
stuart
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
drew
out
a
thick
letter
upon
which
georgiana
recognized
her
handwriting
this
came
only
yesterday
morning
in
spite
of
herself
the
girl
felt
a
wild
thrill
of
pain
her
chum
her
chum
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
failed
to
be
open
with
her
as
if
he
recognized
that
the
sight
of
the
letter
had
told
even
more
plainly
than
words
could
have
done
the
degree
of
intercommunication
between
the
two
presumable
lovers
stuart
said
quickly
i
was
going
to
tell
you
george
on
my
word
i
was
i
knew
you
care
for
me
that
way
but
i
was
afraid
it
might
hurt
just
the
same
after
all
our
vows
somehow
the
days
went
by
so
fast
and
well
you
see
there
was
channing
a
while
back
i
thought
you
were
going
to
marry
him
more
than
likely
you
did
really
think
it
jimps
i
do
know
what
i
thought
george
we
getting
in
oh
and
he
broke
off
she
knew
what
had
happened
for
with
the
first
glimpse
of
the
great
terminal
station
the
things
which
thus
far
had
been
never
really
vivid
in
her
consciousness
had
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
taken
terrible
form
this
was
new
york
and
somewhere
in
it
they
were
to
find
jeannette
stricken
in
the
midst
of
her
youth
and
beauty
and
joy
of
life
and
love
if
only
they
might
find
the
worst
of
the
danger
safely
past
they
were
rushed
in
a
taxicab
to
the
great
uptown
hotel
to
find
there
a
message
saying
that
the
whole
family
were
at
the
hospital
and
that
they
were
to
follow
at
once
in
the
second
cab
georgiana
hand
again
found
stuart
and
stayed
there
his
face
was
set
now
he
spoke
not
a
word
and
even
through
his
glove
his
hand
was
cold
to
the
touch
then
presently
they
were
at
the
big
hospital
with
the
characteristic
odour
so
suggestive
to
the
senses
of
the
tragedies
which
take
place
there
night
and
day
meeting
them
at
the
very
portal
it
was
georgiana
who
made
the
necessary
inquiries
for
stuart
seemed
like
one
dazed
with
fear
of
that
which
was
to
come
he
followed
her
with
his
fingers
gripping
his
hat
brim
with
a
clutch
like
that
of
a
vise
his
eyes
looking
straight
ahead
an
attendant
led
them
to
a
private
room
and
here
in
a
moment
georgiana
found
herself
caught
in
rosalie
arms
with
pale
faces
all
about
which
tried
to
smile
reassuringly
but
could
succeed
only
in
looking
strained
it
was
aunt
olivia
who
seemed
most
composed
and
who
made
the
situation
clear
uncle
thomas
could
only
grasp
the
newcomers
hands
and
press
them
while
his
lips
shook
and
his
speech
halted
it
is
a
very
peculiar
case
and
we
had
to
wait
till
a
certain
surgeon
came
who
was
out
of
town
doctor
craig
they
seemed
to
think
it
safer
to
wait
for
him
he
has
had
extraordinary
success
in
similar
cases
he
is
with
her
now
operating
my
dear
i
am
very
glad
you
have
come
and
you
stuart
she
wanted
you
both
and
we
felt
that
if
her
mind
were
at
rest
her
chances
but
here
even
aunt
olivia
long
training
in
composure
under
all
circumstances
deserted
her
and
she
let
georgiana
put
her
in
a
chair
and
kneel
beside
her
murmuring
affection
and
hope
it
was
a
long
wait
or
so
it
seemed
interrupted
only
once
by
the
entrance
of
a
young
hospital
interne
who
came
to
advise
the
family
of
the
patient
that
thus
far
all
was
going
well
it
had
proved
as
was
expected
a
complicated
case
and
there
was
necessity
of
proceeding
slowly
but
doctor
westfall
had
sent
word
to
them
to
be
of
good
cheer
for
the
patient
pulse
was
strong
and
doctor
craig
reputation
as
they
knew
was
very
great
it
jefferson
craig
you
know
explained
young
chester
crofton
softly
to
georgiana
we
mighty
lucky
to
get
him
he
only
came
back
from
abroad
two
days
ago
and
he
was
operating
out
of
town
somewhere
last
night
doctor
westfall
was
awfully
keen
to
have
him
and
nobody
else
georgiana
knew
the
name
as
who
did
not
jefferson
craig
was
the
man
whose
brilliant
research
work
along
certain
lines
of
surgery
had
astonished
both
his
colleagues
and
an
attentive
general
public
and
his
operative
surgery
on
those
lines
had
disproved
all
previous
theories
as
to
the
possibilities
of
interference
in
a
class
of
cases
until
recently
considered
hopeless
after
an
early
stage
it
was
indeed
subject
for
confidence
if
doctor
craig
skilful
hands
were
those
now
at
service
but
there
is
no
beguiling
such
periods
of
suspense
with
assurance
of
former
successes
in
similar
cases
jeannette
family
had
need
of
all
their
fortitude
for
the
bearing
of
such
suspense
before
doctor
westfall
the
crofton
family
physician
from
the
home
city
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
had
been
brought
on
by
them
when
they
were
summoned
to
jeannette
bedside
he
had
known
the
girl
from
her
babyhood
and
the
signs
of
past
tension
were
clearly
visible
in
his
face
as
he
looked
upon
his
patient
family
though
his
eyes
were
very
bright
and
his
lips
were
smiling
safely
over
was
his
instant
greeting
and
his
hand
fell
with
the
touch
of
hearty
friendship
on
the
shoulder
of
thomas
crofton
i
would
come
till
i
was
sure
i
might
bid
you
draw
a
long
breath
and
ease
up
on
this
strain
of
waiting
they
came
around
him
aunt
olivia
lips
trembling
her
hand
fast
in
georgiana
young
chester
crofton
gave
a
subdued
whoop
of
joy
and
pretty
rosalie
scarcely
out
of
emotional
girlhood
burst
into
hysterical
crying
which
she
struggled
vainly
to
keep
soundless
mind
you
warned
doctor
westfall
wiping
his
own
eyes
though
he
continued
to
smile
i
do
say
all
danger
is
past
doctor
craig
would
be
the
last
man
to
countenance
such
a
statement
we
must
hold
steady
for
several
days
before
we
can
speak
with
absolute
assurance
but
every
sign
points
to
safety
and
certainly
certainly
well
he
paused
as
if
he
could
not
readily
find
words
for
that
which
he
wished
to
say
if
it
had
been
anybody
but
our
jeannette
i
should
have
congratulated
myself
on
the
chance
to
see
such
a
piece
of
work
as
that
i
never
seen
jefferson
craig
operate
though
i
been
a
fascinated
follower
of
his
research
and
have
read
every
word
he
has
written
and
he
astonishingly
young
i
expected
to
see
a
man
of
my
own
age
we
must
see
him
doctor
murmured
crofton
striving
to
regain
her
composure
which
as
is
often
the
case
was
more
shaken
by
the
assurance
of
good
news
than
by
the
fear
of
bad
we
must
thank
him
for
ourselves
he
will
come
in
to
see
us
as
soon
as
he
is
out
of
his
gown
i
going
back
for
him
in
a
minute
for
i
knew
you
would
want
the
words
from
his
own
lips
you
will
like
him
you
will
like
him
immensely
he
went
away
again
presently
on
this
errand
an
imposing
figure
of
a
man
of
fifty
accustomed
to
responsibility
and
able
to
carry
it
a
typical
city
physician
of
the
class
employed
by
the
prosperous
but
with
certain
clearly
defined
lines
about
his
eyes
and
lips
which
proclaimed
him
a
lover
of
human
nature
and
a
sympathizer
with
its
sufferings
in
whatever
class
he
might
find
his
patients
he
such
a
dear
declared
rosalie
wiping
away
her
tears
and
smiling
at
james
stuart
he
adored
jeannette
ever
since
she
was
born
and
i
know
he
been
just
as
anxious
as
we
were
do
cheer
up
jimmy
i
just
as
sure
she
going
to
get
well
now
as
i
was
sure
she
was
before
i
do
dare
to
be
sure
he
answered
in
a
low
tone
georgiana
looked
at
him
and
saw
how
shaken
he
still
was
notwithstanding
the
reassuring
news
in
spite
of
her
anxiety
she
had
been
observant
ever
since
she
entered
the
room
of
the
attitude
of
jeannette
family
toward
james
mckenzie
stuart
it
had
not
been
difficult
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
for
jeannette
sake
they
would
accept
him
and
that
for
his
own
sake
they
were
forced
in
varying
degrees
to
like
him
how
could
they
help
it
she
wondered
when
they
looked
at
his
fine
frank
face
and
observed
his
manly
bearing
he
was
college
bred
he
was
a
successful
worker
with
his
brain
as
well
as
with
his
hands
for
his
farming
was
scientific
farming
and
his
results
established
a
model
for
the
community
he
was
by
no
means
poor
and
yet
georgiana
realized
that
the
change
for
jeannette
from
a
home
of
luxury
to
one
of
comparative
austerity
of
living
would
be
a
tremendous
one
well
such
events
had
occurred
before
in
the
world
history
and
it
was
by
no
means
unthinkable
that
they
should
occur
again
as
georgiana
noted
the
tense
look
on
stuart
face
and
saw
the
hardly
abated
suffering
in
his
eyes
she
said
to
herself
that
if
jeannette
cared
as
much
for
him
as
he
for
her
she
cared
quite
enough
to
bring
her
family
to
terms
at
any
price
the
door
opened
again
as
quietly
as
hospital
doors
invariably
open
and
doctor
westfall
advanced
once
more
into
the
room
followed
by
a
younger
man
with
a
grave
face
and
the
unassuming
quietly
assured
bearing
of
established
success
as
georgiana
eyes
fell
upon
the
distinguished
surgeon
whose
name
was
jefferson
craig
she
recognized
her
former
lodger
jefferson
that
she
did
not
for
a
moment
wonder
what
jefferson
was
doing
here
in
the
famous
surgeon
place
was
due
to
the
fact
that
her
mind
instantly
bridged
the
chasm
between
the
two
personalities
and
made
them
one
yet
there
was
a
subtle
but
easily
recognizable
difference
between
the
personality
of
jefferson
and
that
of
doctor
craig
there
could
be
no
question
that
here
his
foot
was
on
his
native
heath
the
literary
worker
had
for
the
time
vanished
and
here
was
the
man
who
did
things
with
his
hands
and
did
them
better
than
other
men
she
had
long
understood
that
he
had
another
and
more
active
place
in
the
world
than
that
which
he
had
temporarily
occupied
as
solely
a
writer
of
books
this
was
the
place
and
nothing
could
have
seemed
less
surprising
than
to
find
him
in
it
at
the
same
time
the
finding
occasioned
a
difficulty
in
maintaining
her
own
composure
of
face
and
manner
she
had
known
jefferson
she
did
not
know
doctor
craig
she
understood
instantly
without
any
explanation
that
he
had
chosen
to
be
known
in
the
obscure
village
by
only
a
part
of
his
name
because
that
name
was
so
notable
that
even
the
two
village
doctors
the
old
one
and
the
young
would
have
recognized
it
and
been
at
his
heels
to
the
detriment
of
those
months
of
rest
from
surgery
which
he
had
dedicated
to
the
exposition
of
his
methods
upon
paper
she
was
quick
to
perceive
also
that
it
would
be
easy
enough
for
doctor
craig
to
prove
as
different
from
jefferson
in
relation
to
his
acquaintance
as
he
was
different
in
his
position
in
the
world
what
indeed
had
jefferson
craig
and
little
georgiana
warne
in
common
certainly
far
far
less
than
had
had
jefferson
and
that
same
georgiana
warne
he
did
not
see
her
at
once
for
the
father
and
mother
of
his
patient
met
him
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
his
first
glance
fell
upon
them
and
remained
there
while
he
spoke
to
them
of
their
daughter
even
in
his
manner
of
speaking
georgiana
felt
a
decided
difference
there
was
a
curious
crispness
and
succinctness
of
speech
that
marked
the
professional
man
which
was
decidedly
different
from
the
more
expanded
conversational
manner
of
jefferson
yes
she
is
sleeping
quietly
under
the
last
effects
of
the
anæsthetic
he
was
saying
when
georgiana
took
note
of
his
words
once
more
we
will
let
her
sleep
it
will
spare
her
some
hours
of
consciousness
will
she
suffer
very
much
when
she
wakes
doctor
was
the
anxious
question
doctor
craig
smile
was
the
very
one
georgiana
had
first
liked
about
him
for
it
transformed
his
face
and
gave
it
back
the
youth
which
his
early
responsibility
in
a
serious
profession
had
done
its
best
to
age
we
shall
not
let
her
suffer
very
much
he
promised
that
not
necessary
nor
desirable
when
may
we
see
her
crofton
pursued
you
may
all
see
her
for
a
moment
before
she
wakens
if
you
wish
afterward
her
mother
and
father
for
just
a
word
and
i
am
told
she
expressed
a
very
strong
wish
to
see
a
young
man
who
was
on
his
way
has
he
come
for
the
sake
of
her
contentment
i
have
agreed
to
allow
him
a
word
with
her
by
and
by
just
a
word
if
he
will
be
very
quiet
it
was
uncle
thomas
who
turned
to
beckon
james
stuart
forward
and
then
to
nod
at
georgiana
immediately
stuart
was
presented
to
doctor
craig
who
looking
intently
into
the
young
man
questioning
face
said
straightforwardly
stuart
and
i
have
met
before
under
quite
different
circumstances
he
knew
me
as
a
writer
of
books
and
may
be
surprised
to
find
me
here
as
i
am
surprised
to
find
him
let
me
present
you
to
my
niece
miss
warne
doctor
craig
said
aunt
olivia
and
georgiana
was
glad
of
the
preparation
the
minutes
had
given
her
for
here
indeed
was
need
for
all
her
powers
of
her
eyes
had
no
sooner
looked
into
those
which
met
them
with
such
a
keen
and
searching
glance
than
she
was
stirred
to
the
depths
she
had
thought
she
had
known
what
it
would
be
to
feel
those
eyes
upon
her
again
but
she
had
not
reckoned
with
the
effect
of
absence
he
made
no
effort
to
conceal
the
situation
when
your
daughter
sees
me
next
crofton
he
said
without
turning
from
georgiana
she
will
know
me
as
miss
warne
and
stuart
do
i
spent
last
winter
in
miss
warne
home
under
the
name
of
jefferson
alone
to
find
time
to
work
at
a
book
i
am
writing
i
gave
it
up
sooner
than
i
had
expected
because
my
work
here
would
not
be
denied
did
jean
know
you
when
she
saw
you
before
the
the
operation
cried
rosalie
full
of
curiosity
at
this
unexpected
turn
of
affairs
she
did
not
see
me
before
she
was
anæsthetized
explained
doctor
craig
and
doctor
westfall
added
patting
rosalie
hand
it
rather
like
a
story
is
it
rosy
doctor
seaver
of
the
staff
here
was
telling
me
this
morning
how
doctor
craig
tried
to
take
a
year
off
to
rest
and
write
but
how
they
got
him
back
and
glad
enough
to
have
him
too
and
yet
we
want
that
book
it
rather
hard
to
have
a
reputation
so
big
it
wo
give
you
time
to
rest
he
needed
the
rest
seaver
told
me
i
had
it
six
months
in
the
country
did
more
for
me
than
a
year
in
town
said
doctor
craig
he
turned
at
the
sound
of
a
light
knock
upon
the
door
he
gave
the
impression
of
a
man
whose
senses
were
every
one
alert
an
apologetic
interne
came
in
with
a
message
for
doctor
craig
and
he
left
them
with
a
final
word
of
confidence
and
the
request
that
they
all
retire
to
rooms
at
the
nearby
hotel
where
they
were
staying
georgiana
found
rosalie
at
her
side
o
george
is
he
really
the
man
you
had
in
your
house
all
this
year
you
lucky
thing
did
you
fall
in
love
with
him
instantly
why
he
perfectly
wonderful
you
think
so
now
child
because
you
know
he
distinguished
if
you
had
seen
him
quietly
working
at
his
book
you
probably
would
have
looked
at
him
a
second
time
rosalie
studied
her
cousin
face
so
intently
that
georgiana
had
some
difficulty
in
maintaining
this
attitude
of
cool
detachment
the
young
girl
shook
her
head
he
could
have
changed
his
face
she
insisted
he
not
a
bit
handsome
but
he
stunning
just
the
same
oh
how
astonished
jean
will
be
when
she
finds
out
who
saved
her
life
when
do
you
suppose
he
let
jimmy
stuart
see
her
he
die
if
he
does
make
sure
she
alive
pretty
soon
chapter
xx
five
minutes
it
was
not
many
hours
before
doctor
craig
himself
led
georgiana
and
james
stuart
together
into
the
room
where
jeannette
lay
she
had
asked
to
see
them
together
he
said
and
they
might
remain
for
precisely
five
minutes
he
immediately
left
the
room
again
and
took
the
nurse
with
him
the
five
minutes
were
spent
by
stuart
with
jeannette
hand
in
both
his
own
as
he
knelt
beside
the
the
bed
where
she
lay
no
pillow
under
her
head
her
face
very
white
but
her
eyes
glowing
jeannette
look
met
georgiana
is
it
all
right
she
said
very
low
of
course
it
all
right
dear
and
i
perfectly
happy
over
it
whispered
georgiana
jeannette
smiled
i
could
be
happy
till
i
was
sure
she
breathed
i
thought
i
might
die
even
yet
and
i
wanted
it
like
this
first
an
inarticulate
murmur
from
stuart
answered
this
but
georgiana
assured
her
very
gently
you
going
to
be
happy
with
jimps
for
years
and
years
jean
darling
they
were
silent
then
as
they
had
been
bidden
but
the
silence
was
eloquent
doctor
craig
coming
in
to
put
an
end
to
the
little
interview
saw
the
unmistakable
tableau
as
stuart
catching
sight
of
him
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
the
surgeon
fingers
closed
upon
his
pulse
he
nodded
as
a
heart
stimulant
you
have
done
very
well
stuart
he
said
but
small
doses
frequently
repeated
are
better
than
large
ones
jeannette
hand
weakly
caught
his
is
it
queer
georgiana
she
murmured
that
it
should
be
your
jefferson
who
has
saved
my
life
in
spite
of
herself
georgiana
could
not
prevent
the
rich
wave
of
colour
which
swept
over
her
face
she
knew
without
venturing
to
look
at
him
that
doctor
craig
eyes
flashed
toward
her
with
a
smile
in
them
she
stooped
over
jeannette
with
a
gay
reply
and
he
began
his
acquaintance
with
you
by
snowballing
you
till
you
almost
had
need
of
his
surgery
on
the
spot
then
she
and
stuart
were
out
in
the
wide
bare
hospital
corridor
and
stuart
was
saying
with
a
shiver
does
she
look
all
right
to
you
george
sure
of
course
she
does
jimps
you
never
saw
her
before
with
her
hair
down
in
braids
and
any
face
looks
pale
against
a
white
bed
he
shook
his
head
i
shall
not
stir
out
of
this
town
till
she
looks
like
herself
to
me
of
course
you
wo
i
wish
i
need
but
i
must
go
back
to
father
they
all
tried
to
dissuade
her
from
this
course
but
she
was
firm
she
knew
well
enough
that
all
jeannette
had
wanted
of
her
was
to
assure
herself
that
she
possessed
a
clear
right
and
title
to
stuart
love
evidently
jeannette
had
guessed
more
at
stuart
past
relations
with
georgiana
than
either
of
them
had
imagined
and
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
happy
without
the
knowledge
that
she
was
not
making
her
cousin
miserable
one
brief
conversation
with
doctor
craig
was
all
that
was
vouchsafed
georgiana
before
she
left
the
city
and
that
took
place
in
the
presence
of
others
in
aunt
olivia
apartment
it
was
clear
enough
how
busy
a
man
he
was
in
this
his
own
world
for
when
he
came
into
the
room
he
explained
to
crofton
that
it
had
been
his
only
chance
since
they
arrived
to
make
a
brief
social
call
upon
the
family
of
his
patient
it
was
but
an
hour
before
georgiana
departure
and
when
he
learned
this
jefferson
craig
came
over
to
her
where
she
sat
upon
a
divan
at
one
end
of
the
long
private
of
the
suite
seeing
this
the
others
of
the
party
began
conversations
of
their
own
after
the
manner
of
the
highly
intelligent
and
for
those
five
minutes
georgiana
lived
in
a
place
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
please
tell
me
all
about
your
father
he
began
and
the
tones
of
his
voice
low
as
are
habitually
those
of
his
profession
could
hardly
have
been
heard
by
one
across
the
room
georgiana
told
him
unconsciously
letting
him
see
that
the
fear
of
her
probable
loss
was
ever
before
her
though
she
could
not
put
it
into
words
she
knew
as
she
spoke
that
his
eyes
did
not
leave
her
face
she
had
no
possible
idea
how
alluring
was
that
face
as
the
light
from
the
sconces
nearby
fell
upon
it
she
was
conscious
womanlike
that
the
small
hat
she
wore
was
made
over
from
one
of
jeannette
and
she
did
not
think
it
becoming
though
it
was
november
she
still
wore
her
summer
suit
for
the
reason
that
since
her
return
from
abroad
jeannette
had
not
found
time
to
pack
and
send
off
the
usual
and
previous
boxes
had
not
included
winter
suits
at
at
all
altogether
with
gloves
upon
her
hands
and
shoes
which
to
her
seemed
disgraceful
though
preserved
with
all
the
care
of
which
she
was
mistress
georgiana
felt
somehow
more
than
ordinarily
shabby
doctor
craig
asked
her
several
questions
he
spoke
of
the
watching
her
closely
as
she
answered
he
asked
how
often
she
went
to
walk
and
how
far
he
asked
what
she
and
her
father
were
reading
he
would
have
asked
other
questions
but
she
interrupted
him
it
not
fair
she
said
please
tell
me
about
the
book
does
it
get
on
do
you
care
to
know
very
much
i
wondering
if
your
copyist
makes
those
german
references
any
clearer
for
the
printer
than
i
did
nobody
has
copied
a
word
i
have
not
written
a
word
the
book
is
at
a
complete
standstill
i
see
no
hope
for
it
until
i
can
take
another
vacation
under
the
name
of
c
jefferson
and
that
you
will
never
take
she
said
positively
i
never
shall
in
the
same
way
there
are
reasons
against
it
the
book
will
have
to
be
written
as
the
others
were
on
trains
on
shipboard
in
my
own
room
late
at
night
is
it
right
to
try
to
put
two
lifetimes
into
one
she
asked
and
now
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
before
she
had
managed
to
avoid
a
direct
meeting
by
those
many
and
engaging
little
makeshifts
girls
have
of
glancing
at
a
man
shoulder
his
ear
his
mouth
and
off
at
the
floor
the
window
anywhere
not
to
let
him
see
clearly
what
she
may
be
afraid
he
will
see
and
georgiana
was
intensely
afraid
that
if
jefferson
craig
got
one
straight
look
with
those
keen
eyes
of
his
he
would
recognize
that
her
whole
aching
throbbing
heart
was
betraying
itself
from
between
those
lifted
lashes
but
now
somehow
with
her
question
she
ventured
to
give
him
this
one
look
the
interview
might
end
at
any
moment
she
must
have
one
straight
survey
of
his
face
bent
so
near
hers
he
gave
it
back
and
until
her
glance
dropped
he
did
not
speak
then
very
low
but
very
clearly
he
said
deliberately
when
may
i
come
the
room
whirled
the
lights
from
the
sconces
danced
together
and
blurred
the
floor
lifted
and
sank
away
again
and
chester
crofton
chose
this
moment
as
if
he
were
not
after
all
really
of
that
highly
intelligent
class
which
knows
when
to
pursue
its
own
conversations
and
when
to
break
into
those
of
others
to
call
across
the
room
oh
i
beg
pardon
doctor
craig
but
when
did
you
say
jean
might
have
something
real
to
eat
rosy
says
it
and
i
say
it
not
yet
at
all
doctor
craig
turned
and
answered
and
turned
back
again
he
was
not
of
the
composition
of
those
who
are
balked
of
answers
to
their
questions
by
interruptions
but
the
little
diversion
gave
georgiana
an
instant
chance
to
make
herself
ready
to
answer
like
a
woman
and
not
like
a
startled
schoolgirl
so
that
when
he
repeated
his
voice
again
dropped
when
georgiana
she
was
able
to
reply
as
quietly
as
she
could
have
wished
do
you
want
to
come
doctor
craig
i
want
to
come
i
have
never
wanted
anything
so
much
then
please
do
very
soon
as
soon
as
i
can
get
away
for
a
few
hours
perhaps
next
week
it
is
always
difficult
but
if
i
plan
ahead
sometimes
i
can
manage
to
make
almost
the
train
i
hope
for
she
nodded
any
train
anytime
there
was
an
instant
silence
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
hear
one
or
two
breaths
from
him
then
would
you
mind
looking
up
just
once
more
i
must
go
in
a
minute
i
ca
even
take
you
to
your
train
but
she
answered
with
an
odd
little
trembling
of
the
lips
please
do
ask
me
to
i
afraid
a
low
laugh
replied
to
that
so
am
i
said
jefferson
craig
he
rose
and
she
rose
with
him
the
others
came
around
and
he
took
leave
of
them
his
handclasp
was
all
that
georgiana
had
for
farewell
for
when
she
lifted
her
eyes
she
let
them
rest
on
his
finely
moulded
chin
but
she
knew
that
in
spite
of
his
expressed
fear
it
was
not
her
round
little
chin
he
looked
at
but
the
gleam
of
her
dark
eyes
through
their
sheltering
lashes
and
that
his
hand
gave
hers
a
pressure
which
carried
with
it
much
meaning
it
told
her
that
which
as
yet
she
hardly
dared
believe
since
the
journey
home
was
made
up
of
changes
of
trains
no
sleeper
was
possible
and
georgiana
sat
staring
out
of
her
car
window
while
those
about
her
slumbered
there
was
too
much
to
think
of
for
sleep
if
she
had
wanted
to
sleep
she
did
not
want
to
sleep
she
wanted
to
live
over
and
over
again
those
five
minutes
with
their
incredible
revelation
and
as
the
wheels
turned
the
rhythm
of
their
turning
was
set
to
one
simple
phrase
the
one
which
had
sent
her
world
whirling
upside
down
and
made
the
stars
leap
out
of
their
courses
when
may
i
come
chapter
xxi
messages
hope
to
reach
elmville
at
seven
jefferson
this
was
the
first
of
them
when
georgiana
received
it
she
had
been
waiting
eight
days
for
this
first
word
she
had
known
well
enough
that
until
jeannette
was
entirely
safe
doctor
craig
would
not
leave
her
georgiana
had
not
minded
that
she
had
had
no
word
she
had
not
really
expected
any
a
man
who
was
too
busy
to
come
would
be
too
busy
to
write
and
she
wanted
no
makeshift
letters
and
she
had
not
minded
the
delay
in
his
coming
rather
she
had
welcomed
it
to
have
time
to
think
to
hug
her
wholly
joyous
knowledge
to
her
heart
to
go
to
sleep
with
it
warm
at
her
breast
and
to
wake
with
it
knocking
at
the
door
of
her
consciousness
this
was
quite
happiness
enough
for
the
immediate
present
meanwhile
what
pleasure
to
put
the
house
in
its
most
shining
order
to
plan
daily
little
special
dishes
lest
he
come
upon
her
unawares
to
sit
and
sew
upon
her
clothing
shifting
and
turning
her
patchwork
materials
until
she
had
worked
out
clever
combinations
which
conveyed
small
hint
of
being
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
said
nothing
to
her
father
of
her
expectations
what
was
there
to
tell
as
yet
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
put
into
words
the
memory
of
that
brief
interview
in
which
so
much
had
been
said
in
so
few
simple
phrases
and
if
father
davy
read
as
it
would
have
been
strange
if
he
had
not
the
signs
of
his
singing
lightness
of
heart
he
made
no
sign
himself
he
only
waited
praying
georgiana
received
her
first
telegram
at
noon
she
had
flown
for
two
wonderful
hours
about
her
kitchen
making
ready
when
the
despatch
was
followed
by
another
unavoidably
detained
will
plan
to
get
away
thursday
this
was
tuesday
georgiana
put
away
her
materials
and
swept
the
house
from
attic
to
cellar
though
it
needed
it
no
more
than
her
glowing
face
needed
colour
what
did
it
matter
let
him
be
detained
a
week
a
month
a
year
he
would
come
to
her
in
the
end
now
that
she
was
sure
of
that
each
day
but
enhanced
the
glorious
hope
of
a
meeting
that
meeting
the
very
thought
of
which
was
enough
to
take
away
her
breath
on
thursday
came
the
message
can
not
leave
this
week
will
advise
by
wire
when
possible
no
letter
came
to
explain
further
these
delays
georgiana
felt
that
she
did
not
need
one
yet
admitted
to
herself
that
the
ordinary
course
in
such
circumstances
would
be
to
send
a
letter
no
matter
of
how
few
words
toward
the
end
of
the
following
week
a
telegram
again
set
a
day
and
hour
and
as
before
another
followed
on
its
heels
to
negative
it
the
last
one
added
deep
regret
and
therefore
bore
balm
and
then
after
several
more
days
came
a
message
which
was
all
but
a
letter
it
seems
impossible
to
arrange
for
absence
at
present
will
you
not
bring
your
father
and
come
to
my
home
on
wednesday
will
meet
train
arriving
journey
will
not
hurt
warne
and
visit
here
will
interest
him
please
do
not
refuse
jefferson
well
what
girl
ever
had
a
suitor
of
this
sort
one
too
busy
to
come
or
write
yet
who
on
the
strength
of
a
few
words
spoken
in
the
presence
of
others
ventured
to
send
for
the
lady
of
his
choice
to
come
to
him
that
he
might
speak
those
other
words
so
necessary
to
the
conclusion
of
the
matter
georgiana
sat
the
slip
of
yellow
paper
while
her
heart
beat
hard
and
painfully
for
with
the
invitation
had
come
instantly
the
bitter
realization
they
could
not
afford
to
go
her
recent
trip
on
the
occasion
of
jeannette
illness
had
taxed
their
always
slender
resources
and
until
the
money
should
come
in
for
the
last
bale
of
rugs
sent
away
there
was
only
enough
in
the
family
treasury
to
keep
them
supplied
with
the
necessities
of
life
the
time
had
come
undoubtedly
it
had
when
she
must
confide
in
father
davy
not
that
he
would
be
able
to
see
any
way
out
but
that
she
could
not
venture
to
refuse
this
urgent
request
without
his
approval
georgiana
tucked
away
in
her
belt
the
last
long
telegram
and
went
to
her
father
he
lay
upon
his
couch
the
blue
veins
on
his
delicate
forehead
showing
with
pitiful
distinctness
in
the
ray
of
november
sunshine
which
chanced
to
fall
upon
him
georgiana
knelt
beside
him
father
davy
she
said
with
her
face
carefully
out
of
his
sight
i
have
a
little
story
to
tell
you
just
the
outlines
of
one
for
you
to
fill
in
when
i
was
in
new
york
jefferson
doctor
craig
you
know
she
had
told
him
this
part
of
the
tale
when
she
had
first
come
home
asked
me
when
when
he
might
come
here
she
paused
her
father
turned
his
head
upon
the
crimson
couch
pillow
but
he
could
not
see
her
face
yes
my
dear
he
said
with
a
little
smile
touching
his
lips
well
that
sounds
natural
enough
he
knows
he
is
always
welcome
here
when
is
he
coming
he
is
coming
he
ca
get
away
he
has
tried
three
different
times
and
cancelled
it
each
time
he
seems
to
be
very
busy
too
busy
even
to
write
that
is
not
strange
he
must
be
a
very
busy
man
doubtless
he
will
come
when
he
can
make
time
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
mr
jefferson
but
you
see
he
wants
us
to
come
there
us
you
and
me
father
davy
you
understand
dear
do
make
me
put
it
into
words
her
father
arm
came
about
her
and
she
buried
her
face
in
his
thin
shoulder
thank
god
he
said
fervently
under
his
breath
thank
the
good
god
who
knows
what
we
need
and
gives
it
to
us
after
a
minute
silence
but
we
ca
go
father
davy
ca
we
i
could
not
of
course
but
you
i
could
go
without
you
to
his
house
and
we
have
any
money
no
money
is
it
so
bad
as
that
and
if
we
had
i
not
sure
that
i
want
to
take
a
journey
to
a
man
so
that
let
me
see
the
telegram
my
dear
requested
warne
when
he
had
read
it
he
regarded
his
daughter
with
a
curious
little
smile
she
was
sitting
upon
the
floor
close
beside
his
couch
her
brilliant
eyes
now
raised
to
his
face
now
veiled
by
their
heavy
lashes
it
seems
clear
enough
he
said
concessions
must
be
made
to
a
man
who
belongs
to
the
people
as
he
does
i
do
think
it
would
be
a
sacrifice
to
your
dignity
daughter
if
you
were
to
go
but
father
darling
do
you
see
i
did
want
to
tell
you
but
there
was
no
other
way
we
have
quite
enough
to
live
on
without
extras
till
the
next
rug
money
comes
but
that
may
not
be
for
a
month
they
are
always
slow
and
for
us
to
go
to
new
york
well
we
could
just
about
get
there
we
could
get
clear
home
father
davy
i
go
penniless
he
lay
looking
at
her
head
with
its
splendid
masses
of
dark
hair
at
the
beautiful
lines
of
her
neck
in
her
working
frock
of
print
at
the
shapely
young
hands
gripping
each
other
with
unconscious
tenseness
in
her
lap
his
eyes
were
like
a
woman
for
understanding
and
his
lips
were
very
tender
slowly
he
raised
himself
to
his
feet
stay
just
where
you
are
daughter
he
said
till
i
come
back
she
waited
staring
at
the
old
crimson
pillow
with
eyes
which
saw
again
the
in
aunt
olivia
apartment
and
the
profile
of
doctor
craig
face
as
he
turned
from
her
at
chester
crofton
interrupting
question
that
was
more
than
three
weeks
ago
father
davy
was
gone
some
little
time
but
he
came
back
at
length
at
his
slow
limping
pace
and
sat
down
upon
the
couch
he
held
in
his
hand
a
little
bag
of
dark
blue
silk
a
little
bag
whose
contents
seemed
all
heavily
down
in
one
corner
georgiana
eyes
regarded
it
with
some
wonder
she
had
thought
she
knew
by
heart
every
one
of
her
father
few
belongings
but
this
little
bag
was
new
to
her
i
think
he
said
softly
the
time
has
come
for
this
it
was
meant
perhaps
to
be
given
you
a
little
later
in
your
history
but
if
your
mother
knew
nay
i
feel
she
does
know
and
approve
she
would
be
the
first
to
say
to
me
it
to
her
now
david
she
never
want
it
more
than
georgiana
leaned
forward
her
lips
parted
she
seemed
hardly
to
breathe
as
her
father
went
on
his
slender
fingers
gently
caressing
the
little
blue
silk
bag
from
the
time
you
were
a
baby
a
very
little
baby
she
saved
this
money
for
you
it
came
mostly
from
wedding
fees
i
always
gave
her
those
to
do
with
as
she
would
they
were
a
country
minister
fees
fees
mostly
once
in
a
great
while
some
affluent
farmer
would
pay
me
five
dollars
how
your
mother
eyes
would
shine
when
i
could
give
her
a
five
she
turned
all
the
bills
and
silver
into
gold
a
great
many
of
these
pieces
are
gold
pieces
there
are
none
of
them
in
circulation
now
it
may
easily
be
that
they
have
increased
in
value
being
almost
a
curiosity
in
these
days
i
think
i
have
heard
of
something
like
that
at
any
rate
dear
it
is
all
yours
it
was
to
have
been
given
to
you
to
buy
your
wedding
outfit
but
she
would
have
wanted
you
to
have
it
when
it
could
help
you
most
he
held
out
the
little
bag
she
made
it
of
a
bit
of
her
wedding
dress
he
said
and
his
hand
trembled
as
it
was
extended
toward
his
daughter
it
was
not
only
her
wedding
dress
it
was
the
best
dress
she
had
for
many
years
with
a
low
cry
that
was
like
that
of
a
mother
for
a
child
georgiana
took
the
little
blue
silk
bag
heavy
in
its
corner
with
the
weight
of
many
small
gold
pieces
and
crushed
it
against
her
lips
then
with
it
held
close
to
her
cheek
she
laid
her
head
down
on
her
father
knee
and
sobbed
her
heart
out
for
the
mother
she
had
missed
for
ten
long
years
in
the
little
bag
there
proved
to
be
almost
a
hundred
dollars
in
all
she
sorely
wanted
to
get
it
to
a
hundred
said
father
davy
when
he
and
georgiana
their
eyes
still
wet
had
counted
the
tarnished
gold
pieces
that
had
waited
so
long
to
be
delivered
to
their
owner
there
seemed
a
dearth
of
marriages
the
year
before
she
went
the
sum
increased
very
slowly
she
must
have
gone
without
things
she
needed
georgiana
said
with
difficulty
i
think
she
did
but
she
would
never
own
it
she
was
very
clever
as
you
are
at
making
things
over
and
over
and
she
looked
always
trim
and
fine
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
and
a
happy
one
in
spite
of
all
she
was
deprived
of
in
her
life
with
a
poor
country
minister
my
little
daughter
can
only
be
as
happy
as
i
have
been
she
used
to
say
is
all
i
ask
my
dear
she
would
have
liked
she
would
have
loved
jefferson
i
ca
get
over
calling
him
that
he
added
with
his
whimsical
smile
struggling
to
shine
through
the
tears
which
would
not
quite
be
mastered
o
father
davy
was
all
georgiana
could
say
but
she
lifted
a
flushed
and
lovely
face
with
all
manner
of
womanly
qualities
written
in
it
and
kissed
her
father
on
brow
and
cheek
and
lips
as
she
would
have
kissed
her
mother
at
such
words
as
those
i
wonder
said
warne
sitting
comfortably
in
the
pullman
chair
his
daughter
had
insisted
upon
if
i
can
possibly
be
awake
not
dreaming
i
never
thought
to
take
another
journey
he
said
it
would
hurt
you
and
it
not
you
not
too
tired
i
have
seen
you
look
so
well
for
a
long
time
declared
his
daughter
the
eyes
of
other
passengers
across
the
aisle
were
irresistibly
drawn
to
these
two
travelers
the
frail
man
with
his
curly
gray
hair
and
his
gentle
blue
eyes
his
worn
but
carefully
kept
garments
his
way
of
turning
to
his
daughter
at
every
change
of
scene
the
daughter
herself
with
her
face
of
charm
under
the
close
hat
with
its
veil
her
clothing
the
suit
of
dark
summer
serge
with
its
lines
of
distinction
which
was
still
doing
duty
as
the
only
presentable
street
suit
she
possessed
they
were
a
more
than
commonly
interesting
pair
these
travelers
and
they
were
furtively
watched
from
behind
more
than
one
newspaper
georgiana
had
no
eyes
for
possible
observers
with
father
davy
she
preferred
to
sit
with
her
chair
turned
toward
the
window
looking
out
at
the
hills
and
trying
to
realize
the
thing
which
was
happening
she
was
actually
on
her
way
to
the
home
of
a
man
whom
a
month
ago
she
had
thought
gone
out
of
her
life
forever
and
even
now
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
of
love
to
her
had
not
asked
her
to
marry
him
yet
he
was
to
meet
her
at
the
end
of
this
short
journey
she
was
to
look
out
upon
the
platform
and
see
that
distinguished
figure
standing
there
waiting
for
her
for
her
georgiana
warne
maker
of
rugs
for
small
sums
of
money
wearer
of
other
people
clothing
undistinguished
by
anything
in
the
world
except
by
being
the
daughter
of
a
real
saint
and
that
was
much
after
all
fate
had
not
left
her
without
the
best
beginning
in
life
the
being
brought
into
it
by
such
a
father
and
mother
bless
them
the
hours
flew
by
the
train
passed
through
the
outlying
towns
and
came
at
last
to
the
monster
city
the
lights
within
the
car
and
without
were
bright
as
they
drew
into
the
great
station
following
the
porter
who
carried
warne
worn
black
bag
and
his
daughter
fine
one
given
her
by
aunt
olivia
that
summer
her
arm
beneath
her
father
georgiana
made
her
way
through
the
car
into
the
vestibule
out
upon
the
platform
no
sight
of
doctor
craig
rewarded
the
hurried
glance
she
gave
about
her
but
before
she
could
take
alarm
a
young
man
in
the
livery
of
a
chauffeur
came
up
to
her
saying
respectfully
i
beg
pardon
is
it
miss
warne
and
upon
her
assent
he
said
rapidly
doctor
craig
bid
me
say
he
was
called
to
a
case
he
could
not
refuse
but
he
hopes
to
be
home
soon
i
am
to
take
you
up
and
to
see
to
your
luggage
we
have
no
luggage
but
these
bags
georgiana
told
him
wondering
for
a
moment
how
he
had
recognized
her
so
readily
then
understanding
that
though
she
herself
might
be
a
figure
indistinguishable
by
description
from
many
another
that
of
father
davy
could
not
fail
of
recognition
by
one
who
had
been
told
what
to
expect
i
have
a
chair
here
for
the
gentleman
the
man
said
and
he
indicated
one
of
the
station
chairs
attended
by
a
porter
warne
being
wheeled
rapidly
through
the
great
station
looked
about
him
with
the
eager
eyes
of
a
boy
it
was
twenty
years
twenty
long
and
quiet
years
since
he
had
been
in
new
york
what
had
not
happened
since
then
in
spite
of
the
myriad
descriptions
he
had
read
and
pictures
he
had
studied
the
effect
upon
him
of
the
real
city
as
having
been
transferred
from
the
chair
to
a
small
but
luxurious
closed
car
he
was
conveyed
along
the
thronged
astonishingly
lighted
streets
was
overwhelming
suddenly
he
closed
his
eyes
and
laid
his
head
back
against
the
cushioned
leather
georgiana
bent
anxiously
toward
him
are
you
frightfully
tired
father
dear
are
you
faint
his
eyes
opened
and
his
lips
smiled
reassuringly
a
little
tired
my
dear
and
very
much
dazed
but
not
upset
in
any
way
i
shall
be
glad
to
sleep
and
glad
to
wake
in
this
wondrous
city
chapter
xxii
toasts
they
drove
downtown
for
many
blocks
turning
at
last
into
an
old
and
still
notable
square
which
is
one
of
the
great
town
almost
untouched
residence
districts
in
the
very
heart
of
its
teeming
commercial
life
here
all
at
once
the
noise
of
traffic
was
quieted
only
as
a
distant
and
not
too
disturbing
murmur
came
the
sounds
of
the
warfare
which
raged
so
near
at
one
of
the
dingy
but
still
stately
old
houses
the
car
drew
up
the
chauffeur
alighted
and
opened
the
door
he
escorted
the
travelers
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
by
a
lad
in
plain
livery
and
he
was
reinforced
immediately
by
a
housekeeper
who
came
forward
and
took
the
guests
in
charge
she
had
a
rosy
face
and
hair
and
her
accent
was
distinctly
scotch
i

said

when

say
gude
nicht
she
led
her
guests
into
a
large
square
pleasant
room
furnished
with
old
mahogany
a
cheery
fire
was
burning
in
a
fireplace
she
opened
a
second
door
and
showed
a
connecting
room
of
lesser
size
but
very
attractive
the
doctor
often
has
special
patients
stayin
in
these
rooms
she
said
but
fortunately
they
were
emptied
three
days
agone
and
kept
for
ye
the
doctor

always
some
puir
soul
he
wants

she
left
them
saying
that

the
doctor

not
returned
by
eight
she
would
serve
dinner
for
miss
warne

the
housekeeper
smiled
the
doctor

she
said
but
i
thinkin
we

wull
ye
coom

to
the
library
miss
warne
when
ye
ready
is
the
door
at

o
the
front
entrance
the
door
on
the
left
is
the
waitin
room
an
the
doctor
does
na
keep
office
hours
at
nicht
with
a
heart
georgiana
set
about
making
ready
for
that
descent
to
the
library
the
whole
affair
was
becoming
more
and
more
a
strain
upon
her
nerves
if
doctor
craig
had
met
them
at
the
station
it
would
have
been
far
easier
for
her
than
this
but
here
she
was
actually
in
his
house
combing
her
hair
in
his
going
down
to
dinner
at
his
table
and
she
had
not
seen
or
heard
from
him
except
by
telegram
since
the
hour
when
he
had
given
her
hand
that
meaning
pressure
and
left
her
with
her
friends
it
was
an
extraordinary
experience
to
say
the
least
she
wondered
how
she
should
dress
for
dinner
the
dinner
that
she
might
eat
alone
she
had
only
her
traveling
suit
and
one
simple
little
gray
silk
dyed
from
a
white
and
made
very
simply
with
a
wide
collar
and
cuffs
of
white
net
anybody
but
georgiana
would
have
looked
like
a
quakeress
in
the
gray
silk
but
with
her
dark
hair
and
warm
colouring
she
succeeded
only
in
imitating
a
young
nun
but
just
removed
from
scenes
of
worldly
gayety
she
decided
that
the
hour
and
the
occasion
called
for
this
frock
and
put
it
on
with
fingers
which
shook
a
little
eight
she
dared
wait
no
longer
so
making
sure
that
her
father
having
eaten
and
drunk
was
resting
luxuriously
on
his
bed
she
opened
her
door
the
house
seemed
very
quiet
and
she
went
slowly
along
the
upper
hall
and
after
pausing
a
moment
at
the
top
of
the
fine
staircase
with
its
white
spindles
and
mahogany
rail
she
began
to
descend
the
steps
were
heavily
padded
and
her
footfall
made
no
sound
therefore
as
she
afterward
realized
a
very
close
watch
must
have
been
kept
for
the
moment
she
came
in
sight
of
the
open
library
door
a
figure
appeared
there
the
next
moment
jefferson
craig
had
crossed
the
hall
and
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
looking
up
at
the
descending
guest
the
guest
naturally
enough
paused
four
stairs
up
looking
down
the
light
from
a
quaint
lantern
hood
of
wrought
iron
and
crystal
hanging
above
the
newel
post
shone
full
upon
the
dark
head
and
vivid
face
above
the
demure
gray
frock
with
its
nunlike
broad
collar
and
cuffs
of
thin
white
the
man
below
looked
for
a
full
minute
without
speaking
but
georgiana
could
not
have
told
what
expression
was
upon
his
face
or
whether
he
smiled
she
knew
that
at
the
end
of
that
long
look
he
stretched
one
arm
toward
her
and
that
obeying
the
gesture
which
was
all
but
a
command
she
came
on
down
those
four
remaining
steps
jefferson
craig
led
her
into
the
library
where
a
great
fire
sparkled
and
leaped
and
filled
the
room
otherwise
sombre
with
books
full
of
welcoming
cheer
he
closed
the
door
then
led
her
to
the
hearth
where
shall
we
begin
he
said
in
that
low
but
very
distinct
voice
she
so
well
remembered
where
we
left
off
i
not
answered
georgiana
looking
away
from
him
into
the
fire
whose
light
flashed
in
her
eyes
less
disconcertingly
than
that
which
she
somehow
knew
leaped
in
his
sure
where
we
left
off
are
you
i
am
we
left
off
where
we
had
each
seen
for
just
one
instant
into
the
other
heart
and
having
seen
there
was
no
forgetting
no
georgiana
she
shook
her
head
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
to
me
he
said
very
gently
her
hand
was
still
held
fast
in
his
i
did
my
best
to
have
it
the
other
way
the
usual
way
there
seemed
a
fate
against
it
i
could
have
written
but
somehow
i
did
want
to
i
preferred
to
wait
with
the
memory
of
your
face
always
before
me
till
i
could
see
it
again
and
now
that
i
see
it
bent
down
and
turned
away
he
laughed
a
low
laugh
of
content
oh
look
up
georgiana
surely
you
not
afraid
now
you
know
i
been
loving
you
ever
since
i
saw
you
first
in
spite
of
thinking
i
must
not
because
of
the
one
i
understood
you
belonged
to
she
looked
up
then
out
of
sheer
astonishment
oh
no
not
since
you
saw
me
first
she
disputed
it
could
be
and
i
thinking
all
the
while
she
stopped
in
confusion
at
the
revelation
she
might
be
making
but
he
caught
her
up
you
thinking
all
the
while
what
tell
me
i
thought
you
had
the
least
interest
in
me
did
you
care
whether
i
had
or
not
i
tried
not
to
care
confessed
georgiana
naïvely
she
smiled
a
sparkling
little
smile
it
was
so
clear
now
that
he
wanted
this
confession
he
looked
at
her
for
a
minute
longer
then
he
said
do
you
think
enough
has
been
said
to
warrant
this
it
was
then
that
georgiana
learned
how
little
one
may
judge
from
outward
quiet
of
manner
and
controlled
speech
what
may
happen
when
the
heart
is
allowed
to
speak
for
itself
forgive
me
he
said
at
last
when
he
had
released
her
all
enchanting
confusion
under
his
intent
gaze
but
you
know
the
breaking
up
of
a
famine
sometimes
makes
human
beings
hard
to
manage
if
you
could
know
the
times
i
watched
you
when
you
were
bent
over
my
illegible
fist
of
copy
and
thought
how
i
should
like
just
to
put
my
hand
on
your
beautiful
hair
a
knock
sounded
upon
the
door
with
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
doctor
craig
left
georgiana
and
opened
it
dinner
is
served
sir
announced
thomas
the
boy
his
master
turned
back
with
a
laughing
remorseful
face
i
had
forgotten
all
about
dinner
he
said
though
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
believe
i
had
no
luncheon
you
must
be
famishing
macfayden
tells
me
your
father
is
resting
we
will
go
up
and
see
him
before
dinner
or
after
i
think
he
will
drop
off
to
sleep
for
a
little
he
is
so
tired
and
then
wake
by
and
by
and
be
ready
to
see
you
good
it
could
be
better
i
am
eager
to
see
warne
but
i
want
him
to
be
ready
for
me
who
have
so
much
to
ask
of
him
meanwhile
shall
we
go
he
offered
her
his
arm
such
graceful
deference
in
his
manner
that
she
felt
afresh
the
wonder
of
his
wish
to
transplant
her
from
her
world
to
his
as
they
walked
slowly
through
the
dignified
old
hall
he
said
in
a
tone
of
great
satisfaction
macfayden
has
ventured
to
hint
to
me
more
than
once
that
this
house
is
of
the
sort
which
needs
a
mistress
when
she
saw
me
come
in
she
said
to
me
very
respectfully
a
gled
day
for
ye
doctor
an
now
that
i
seen
the
lassie
i
can
congratulate
ye
wi
all
mae
hert
she
mak
a
bonny
lady
to
be
at
the
head
o
the
hoose
if
ye
permit
me
to
say
the
thocht
i
assure
you
georgiana
the
conquest
of
my
good
scottish
housekeeper
upon
sight
is
no
small
achievement
it
must
have
been
my
gray
gown
and
white
cuffs
suggested
the
girl
demurely
he
looked
down
at
the
hand
resting
on
his
arm
now
that
i
have
time
to
look
at
anything
but
your
face
he
said
i
see
that
you
are
wearing
something
very
satisfying
to
the
eye
i
like
simple
things
such
as
i
have
always
seen
you
wear
with
inward
astonishment
and
congratulation
georgiana
thought
of
all
the
dyed
and
reconstructed
which
had
marched
in
a
frugal
procession
across
his
vision
during
the
past
year
suddenly
she
felt
an
affection
for
the
very
frock
she
wore
difficult
as
had
been
its
achievement
from
the
materials
in
hand
certainly
women
in
beautiful
and
wonderful
clothing
such
as
he
saw
daily
had
had
no
chance
with
him
against
the
attraction
of
herself
in
the
cleverly
adapted
makeshifts
of
her
own
fingers
it
was
the
girl
who
had
made
the
most
of
herself
and
her
home
out
of
her
restricted
means
who
had
drawn
to
her
side
this
man
whose
judgment
must
approve
his
love
or
he
could
never
love
at
all
things
had
been
so
unequal
after
all
the
wise
god
who
had
set
her
life
thus
far
in
the
midst
of
poverty
had
given
her
with
which
to
fight
it
the
wit
and
resource
which
fashion
weapons
out
of
materials
which
more
favoured
mortals
cast
away
that
greatest
of
gifts
bestowed
upon
the
daughters
of
men
had
been
hers
the
creative
touch
at
last
she
recognized
it
and
knew
it
for
what
it
was
using
this
good
gift
she
had
learned
other
things
than
the
making
of
clothes
a
great
warm
surge
of
joy
and
understanding
enveloped
georgiana
warne
as
jefferson
craig
having
led
her
into
the
and
placed
her
ceremoniously
in
her
chair
bent
over
her
where
she
sat
saying
softly
this
place
has
been
waiting
a
long
time
at
the
bachelor
board
now
that
i
see
it
filled
like
this
i
know
how
well
worth
while
it
been
to
wait
he
took
the
place
opposite
her
with
a
nod
at
the
boy
thomas
he
dismissed
him
for
the
moment
he
looked
across
the
table
rich
with
the
finest
appointments
in
his
house
arranged
by
a
housekeeper
who
heartily
approved
his
everyday
simplicity
of
life
but
who
exulted
in
the
chance
to
show
the
lady
of
his
choice
the
fine
old
heirlooms
of
silver
and
damask
which
were
to
come
to
her
smiling
he
lifted
a
delicately
chased
goblet
of
water
which
stood
beside
his
plate
to
my
wife
he
said
georgiana
raising
the
face
of
a
rose
took
up
her
own
glass
she
looked
at
it
a
moment
her
eyes
like
dark
twin
fires
her
lips
taking
on
lovely
curves
then
she
lifted
it
toward
the
man
opposite
to
still
afraid
asked
jefferson
craig
watching
her
as
one
watches
only
that
which
is
the
delight
of
his
eyes
never
mind
i
teach
you
by
and
by
the
word
i
want
to
hear
upstairs
the
slender
figure
on
the
bed
stirred
from
the
brief
sleep
which
had
claimed
it
father
davy
opened
his
eyes
again
upon
the
firelit
room
and
the
pleasant
comfort
which
surrounded
him
before
they
come
he
thought
i
must
tell
my
father
how
i
feel
about
it
i
was
too
tired
even
to
pray
but
i
am
quite
rested
now
he
slipped
down
gently
to
his
knees
and
closed
his
eyes
folding
his
thin
hands
on
the
heavy
white
counterpane
before
him
dear
god
he
said
i
have
the
desire
of
my
heart
the
answer
to
my
prayers
and
i
am
very
glad
yet
thou
knowest
my
heart
is
heavy
too
with
longing
for
my
phoebe
tell
her
father
that
her
child
is
happy
in
the
love
of
the
best
man
she
could
have
asked
for
and
tell
her
that
david
loves
and
longs
for
her
with
the
love
that
will
never
die
for
that
love
that
will
not
die
in
spite
of
years
and
pain
i
thank
thee
if
it
may
be
give
our
child
the
same
blessed
experience
and
teach
us
to
love
and
serve
thee
world
without
end
amen
chapter
xxiii
why
not
there
just
one
more
thing
to
be
settled
observed
jefferson
craig
while
we
are
settling
things
suppose
we
attend
to
that
he
stood
upon
the
hearthrug
before
the
fire
in
his
library
elbow
on
chimney
piece
looking
down
upon
his
two
guests
it
was
eight
of
the
evening
following
that
upon
which
david
warne
and
georgiana
had
arrived
at
the
big
new
york
house
in
the
downtown
square
although
they
had
been
under
the
hospitable
roof
for
more
than
hours
it
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
three
had
been
together
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
on
the
previous
evening
in
an
upstairs
room
had
been
enacted
a
little
scene
which
would
live
forever
in
the
memories
of
them
all
but
doctor
craig
perceiving
with
trained
eyes
the
signs
of
growing
fatigue
in
his
frail
friend
after
the
unwonted
strain
of
the
day
and
its
necessarily
emotional
climax
had
gently
but
firmly
insisted
on
withdrawing
at
an
early
hour
georgiana
had
remained
with
her
father
herself
content
to
have
the
strange
and
wonderful
day
end
in
the
old
simple
and
natural
way
in
which
her
days
had
ended
for
so
long
she
had
felt
as
she
performed
her
customary
daughterly
offices
for
the
beloved
invalid
that
she
had
quite
enough
to
take
with
her
to
her
own
pillow
to
insure
its
being
the
happiest
upon
which
she
had
ever
laid
her
head
they
had
seen
little
of
doctor
craig
on
the
following
day
but
he
had
taken
dinner
with
them
that
night
and
as
he
had
brought
them
back
to
the
library
fire
he
had
given
stringent
directions
to
the
boy
thomas
that
he
be
disturbed
only
for
the
most
important
summons
and
hardly
had
the
trio
taken
their
places
in
the
pleasant
room
before
jefferson
craig
made
his
statement
that
there
was
something
still
unsettled
in
their
affairs
as
he
spoke
he
was
looking
down
at
georgiana
it
would
have
been
strange
if
he
could
have
kept
his
eyes
away
from
her
like
a
flower
in
sunshine
had
she
bloomed
under
the
warm
influence
of
the
joy
which
had
come
to
her
when
she
least
expected
it
she
was
again
wearing
the
little
gray
silk
frock
but
now
its
nunlike
simplicity
was
gone
and
happily
gone
for
a
bunch
of
glowing
pink
killarney
roses
at
her
belt
placed
there
by
doctor
craig
hands
lighted
the
plain
costume
into
one
of
a
charm
which
could
no
longer
be
called
demure
something
still
to
settle
it
was
father
davy
who
replied
for
georgiana
had
no
answer
for
that
suggestion
one
glance
at
doctor
craig
face
as
he
said
the
words
had
told
her
what
was
coming
the
most
important
thing
of
all
everything
else
is
in
order
you
dear
sir
have
agreed
to
come
and
live
with
us
we
are
convinced
that
not
a
sacrifice
except
for
the
leaving
of
certain
old
friends
you
have
a
zest
still
for
seeing
and
hearing
the
things
you
have
been
denied
it
to
be
our
keen
pleasure
to
make
your
days
go
by
on
wings
going
to
have
plenty
of
room
here
for
the
bookcases
and
the
books
all
the
furnishings
you
care
to
keep
in
short
you
to
live
the
old
life
with
a
fine
new
one
as
well
altogether
everything
is
in
train
for
the
great
change
except
he
crossed
the
hearthrug
at
a
stride
and
laid
a
son
hand
upon
the
thin
shoulder
of
father
davy
except
the
date
of
it
he
finished
smiling
down
into
the
uplifted
face
but
that
replied
georgiana
father
without
hesitation
is
not
for
me
to
settle
it
is
for
you
two
craig
looked
across
at
georgiana
and
for
a
minute
studied
her
profile
as
she
sat
gazing
into
the
flames
then
came
round
to
her
plucking
a
pillow
from
a
big
leather
couch
by
the
way
to
drop
it
at
her
feet
and
throw
himself
down
upon
it
so
placed
he
could
look
straight
into
her
face
you
have
to
take
an
interest
in
the
ceiling
now
if
you
succeed
in
avoiding
me
he
said
with
a
low
laugh
i
do
want
to
avoid
you
answered
georgiana
and
let
her
eyes
meet
his
fairly
for
an
instant
she
could
not
yet
do
this
in
a
quite
casual
way
he
crossed
his
arms
upon
her
knee
sitting
in
a
boyish
attitude
and
looking
not
unlike
a
big
boy
for
the
moment
for
all
the
lines
of
care
were
gone
from
his
face
in
the
soft
firelight
and
happiness
had
laid
its
rosy
mantle
over
his
shoulders
as
over
hers
he
began
to
speak
rather
quickly
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
think
of
a
reason
why
you
should
go
back
and
spend
a
winter
in
the
same
old
grind
waiting
till
spring
and
making
me
wait
till
spring
why
should
anybody
wait
till
spring
i
let
you
talk
about
all
the
work
you
were
going
to
do
this
winter
at
home
but
that
was
just
because
i
did
want
to
make
you
feel
as
if
you
were
caught
in
a
trap
i
had
an
idea
that
for
a
few
hours
anyhow
it
might
seem
enough
of
a
change
to
come
down
here
and
promise
to
marry
a
perfect
stranger
of
a
surgeon
instead
of
the
light
you
knew
i
thought
we
let
it
go
at
that
for
those
few
hours
but
now
it
does
seem
to
me
possible
to
go
back
to
bachelorhood
again
even
with
such
a
prospect
before
me
in
the
spring
not
after
having
tasted
this
georgiana
why
must
i
her
face
was
the
colour
of
her
roses
there
was
no
getting
away
from
the
challenge
of
those
eyes
that
watched
her
so
steadily
not
even
by
following
his
suggestion
and
gazing
persistently
ceilingward
craig
glanced
at
father
davy
to
find
that
his
soft
blue
eyes
showed
no
sign
of
shock
and
that
his
face
was
perfectly
placid
as
he
looked
and
listened
the
younger
man
went
on
coming
straight
to
the
point
georgiana
marry
me
before
you
go
back
you
promised
to
stay
a
week
let
have
a
wedding
here
next
wednesday
then
we
leave
father
davy
here
comfortably
with
macfayden
and
run
up
to
see
about
getting
things
packed
and
shipped
i
take
that
much
of
a
vacation
now
then
in
april
we
go
abroad
for
a
real
honeymoon
and
take
father
davy
with
us
i
propose
that
now
but
the
seas
are
stormy
in
december
and
january
and
we
must
risk
it
for
him
but
let
not
wait
why
should
we
now
honestly
why
should
we
the
girl
turned
her
face
with
a
strange
little
look
of
appeal
toward
her
father
to
meet
such
a
look
of
entire
comprehension
as
stirred
her
to
the
depths
suddenly
obeying
an
impulse
she
did
not
understand
she
drew
herself
gently
away
from
craig
rose
and
went
to
the
figure
in
the
big
chair
opposite
she
sat
down
on
the
arm
and
bending
dropped
her
face
upon
the
fatherly
shoulder
hiding
it
there
craig
sat
perfectly
still
watching
the
pair
as
father
davy
put
up
a
thin
white
hand
and
patted
the
dark
head
then
the
two
men
smiled
at
each
other
after
a
while
craig
got
up
and
quietly
left
the
room
by
and
by
father
davy
whispered
what
is
it
dear
you
not
ready
you
shall
not
be
hurried
or
is
it
she
spoke
into
his
ear
i
want
to
go
back
home
and
earn
and
earn
enough
to
can
you
earn
it
daughter
can
you
ever
get
enough
ahead
to
provide
what
you
would
like
and
meanwhile
he
wants
you
very
much
my
dear
i
think
i
know
more
of
his
heart
than
you
do
in
way
last
winter
we
had
certain
talks
that
showed
me
a
little
of
that
would
it
be
such
a
blow
to
pride
to
do
as
he
asks
unless
in
other
ways
you
are
not
ready
if
your
love
for
him
is
quite
mature
enough
yet
oh
it
is
that
it
mature
enough
it
it
has
grown
in
spite
of
me
all
this
year
like
a
tumbleweed
her
voice
was
a
little
breathless
not
to
have
got
its
growth
its
first
growth
amended
her
father
with
a
meaning
smile
she
nodded
but
if
you
could
know
how
i
want
time
to
make
the
most
of
what
mother
left
me
i
could
do
so
much
if
i
just
had
time
if
i
used
it
now
i
should
have
to
use
it
up
so
fast
there
be
fifty
dollars
left
when
we
get
back
i
could
almost
make
that
do
if
no
of
course
i
could
but
i
could
earn
more
o
father
davy
is
it
wrong
of
me
to
be
so
proud
not
wrong
my
girl
but
very
natural
i
suppose
yet
to
me
well
dear
i
hardly
know
how
to
say
what
i
feel
i
confess
i
should
like
to
see
you
married
to
this
man
life
is
so
short
they
sat
together
in
silence
for
a
time
then
georgiana
slipped
back
into
the
seat
where
she
had
been
presently
father
davy
said
that
it
had
been
a
full
day
and
that
he
thought
he
should
be
fitter
for
the
morrow
if
he
should
go
to
bed
georgiana
went
up
with
him
saw
him
comfortably
resting
listened
while
he
whispered
something
in
her
ear
as
she
bent
above
him
kissed
him
with
her
heart
on
her
lips
and
finally
stole
like
a
mouse
down
the
stairs
again
when
she
came
into
the
library
once
more
it
was
to
find
herself
in
arms
which
held
her
close
do
you
think
i
do
understand
my
dearest
said
the
low
voice
which
had
such
power
to
move
her
do
you
think
i
do
respect
and
love
you
for
your
perfectly
natural
feeling
about
it
all
but
georgiana
you
bring
me
a
dowry
bigger
than
any
i
could
ask
for
the
inheritance
from
such
a
father
as
he
is
and
from
the
mother
who
gave
you
all
he
left
her
to
give
what
are
towels
and
tablecloths
i
do
know
what
it
is
brides
bring
beside
such
things
as
these
you
give
me
the
real
thing
and
let
me
furnish
the
ones
that
count
dear
if
you
could
know
the
pleasure
there
is
for
me
in
the
very
thought
of
buying
you
a
hat
she
could
but
smile
his
tone
put
so
much
awe
into
the
word
suddenly
she
grew
whimsical
it
was
so
like
georgiana
to
do
that
when
she
was
deeply
stirred
what
do
you
suppose
that
hat
was
made
of
i
wore
here
she
asked
him
i
tell
you
i
found
the
shape
for
cents
at
the
village
milliner
i
cut
it
down
and
sewed
it
up
again
into
another
shape
then
i
hunted
through
the
old
you
do
know
what
those
are
do
you
i
found
a
piece
of
velvet
that
had
been
a
flounce
i
steamed
it
and
covered
the
shape
then
i
had
to
have
some
trimming
it
came
from
an
old
evening
cloak
of
my
cousin
jeannette
a
bit
of
gilt
a
silk
rose
some
ribbon
from
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
came
from
but
it
had
to
be
dyed
to
match
the
velvet
i
could
quite
get
the
shade
but
the
hat
when
it
was
done
was
so
bad
where
is
it
now
upstairs
in
my
room
would
you
mind
getting
it
she
laughed
hesitated
finally
ran
upstairs
and
down
again
the
hat
in
hand
pausing
before
an
old
gilt
mirror
in
the
hall
she
put
it
on
then
came
to
him
lifting
her
head
with
a
proud
and
merry
look
which
bade
him
beware
how
he
might
venture
to
criticise
the
work
of
her
hands
adjusting
his
eyeglasses
with
care
he
viewed
it
judicially
it
looks
very
nice
to
me
he
said
suppose
you
keep
it
on
and
put
on
a
coat
and
let
me
take
you
out
in
the
car
for
a
few
minutes
there
a
certain
window
uptown
i
should
like
to
look
at
with
you
i
have
no
coat
she
said
steadily
and
now
the
colour
ebbed
a
little
from
her
warm
cheek
except
the
one
that
belongs
with
the
suit
i
wore
it
short
it
would
do
to
wear
with
a
dress
like
this
i
see
suddenly
he
came
close
again
gently
lifted
the
hat
from
the
dark
masses
of
her
hair
laid
it
carefully
on
a
table
near
by
and
drew
her
with
him
to
a
broad
couch
at
one
side
of
the
fire
i
can
see
he
said
very
quietly
that
you
and
i
have
much
to
do
in
getting
to
know
each
other
let
lose
no
time
in
beginning
listen
while
i
try
to
tell
you
what
marriage
means
to
me
and
to
find
out
what
it
means
to
you
it
was
a
long
talk
and
by
the
kindness
of
the
fates
which
rule
over
the
irregular
schedule
of
the
men
of
craig
profession
an
uninterrupted
one
long
before
it
was
over
georgiana
learned
many
new
things
concerning
the
man
who
was
to
be
her
husband
not
the
least
of
which
was
his
power
of
making
others
see
as
he
saw
feel
as
he
felt
and
believe
from
first
to
last
in
his
absolute
integrity
of
motive
and
when
he
told
her
what
he
thought
he
could
do
for
her
father
if
he
should
have
him
under
his
eye
during
the
coming
winter
the
period
which
was
always
so
long
and
trying
for
the
sensitive
frame
of
the
invalid
whose
resisting
powers
were
at
their
lowest
when
the
winter
winds
were
blowing
she
gave
way
and
the
question
was
settled
but
she
did
not
give
way
in
everything
after
all
nor
did
he
ask
her
to
do
so
when
he
suggested
details
of
preparation
and
she
shook
her
head
he
smiled
and
told
her
it
should
all
be
as
she
wished
and
when
he
said
very
gently
that
he
hoped
she
would
let
him
provide
her
with
the
means
to
buy
whatever
she
might
need
because
everything
that
he
had
was
hers
already
he
took
with
a
submission
that
was
all
grace
her
refusal
to
use
a
penny
of
his
until
she
should
bear
his
name
if
he
made
certain
reservations
of
his
own
as
to
what
might
happen
when
he
should
hold
the
right
that
did
not
show
so
that
i
get
you
dearest
he
said
at
the
end
of
the
evening
just
before
he
let
her
go
i
am
willing
to
take
you
in
any
sort
of
package
you
may
select
for
yourself
personally
it
seems
to
me
that
cotton
is
the
most
appropriate
background
for
you
if
you
wo
have
a
case
at
which
georgiana
laughed
and
assured
him
that
she
was
no
real
jewel
only
one
of
the
secondary
stones
and
uncut
at
that
the
answer
she
got
to
this
sent
her
off
upstairs
with
thrilling
pulses
to
lie
awake
for
a
long
time
recalling
his
voice
and
look
as
he
said
the
few
suddenly
grave
words
which
had
given
her
a
glimpse
of
his
bare
heart
chapter
xxiv
magic
gold
the
days
which
followed
were
to
be
remembered
with
peculiar
delight
all
georgiana
life
each
morning
in
doctor
craig
own
car
accompanied
by
her
father
she
went
shopping
warne
could
not
use
his
strength
in
following
her
into
the
shops
but
he
could
sit
at
ease
in
a
corner
of
the
luxurious
closed
landau
an
extra
pillow
tucked
behind
his
back
an
electric
footwarmer
at
his
feet
his
slender
form
wrapped
in
a
wonderful
coat
which
his
had
put
upon
him
with
the
reasonable
explanation
that
it
had
proved
to
be
too
small
for
himself
from
this
sheltered
position
he
could
watch
the
hurrying
crowds
study
the
faces
and
find
untiring
interest
in
the
happenings
of
the
streets
not
the
smallest
part
of
his
pleasure
lay
in
receiving
his
daughter
again
each
time
she
came
hurrying
out
of
some
great
portal
the
tiniest
of
packages
under
her
arm
although
duncan
doctor
craig
chauffeur
was
always
watching
ready
to
jump
from
his
seat
and
assist
her
she
was
usually
too
quick
for
him
to
be
of
much
use
though
she
always
gave
him
her
friendly
smile
and
thanks
for
his
eagerness
it
may
be
said
that
duncan
himself
a
young
scotsman
whose
devotion
to
his
master
was
now
augmented
by
his
admiration
of
his
master
choice
enjoyed
those
shopping
expeditions
with
an
unusual
zest
oh
but
these
shops
are
wonderful
father
davy
georgiana
was
fain
to
cry
as
she
came
back
with
her
purchases
of
course
i
have
to
shut
my
eyes
and
simply
fly
past
the
counters
where
i
like
to
buy
everything
in
sight
but
i
do
find
such
glorious
little
bargains
such
treasures
of
you
ca
think
how
i
making
my
money
hold
out
i
so
thankful
for
all
my
training
in
turning
and
twisting
it
such
a
help
just
now
if
father
davy
rejoiced
within
himself
that
the
days
of
for
georgiana
were
all
but
past
and
that
there
was
to
be
no
more
turning
and
twisting
at
least
with
material
things
he
did
not
say
so
instead
he
surveyed
the
contents
of
the
small
packages
with
eyes
which
were
nearly
as
bright
as
hers
and
made
her
supremely
content
with
his
approval
the
climax
of
the
shopping
came
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
georgiana
returned
to
the
car
after
a
more
than
usually
long
absence
during
which
for
the
first
time
warne
had
become
slightly
weary
of
using
his
eyes
in
watching
the
throng
and
had
dropped
off
in
his
warm
corner
into
a
little
refreshing
nap
he
wakened
to
find
georgiana
beside
him
the
car
moving
uptown
by
a
less
congested
route
than
they
had
taken
before
and
his
daughter
hand
firmly
clasping
his
he
looked
round
at
her
and
saw
to
his
surprise
and
dismay
that
her
heavy
lashes
were
thick
with
tears
but
she
smiled
through
them
and
bade
him
wait
to
hear
the
reason
until
they
were
in
the
park
where
each
morning
a
drive
according
to
doctor
craig
suggestion
was
taken
before
the
swift
run
back
to
the
downtown
square
the
moment
they
were
well
within
the
precincts
and
had
entered
upon
the
less
frequented
drive
which
she
had
asked
for
georgiana
turned
to
her
father
she
held
up
something
before
him
and
looking
at
it
he
discovered
the
little
old
bag
of
dark
blue
silk
which
her
mother
had
fashioned
from
her
own
wedding
gown
and
which
had
contained
the
treasured
gold
pieces
which
had
made
it
possible
for
georgiana
to
have
a
wedding
gown
of
her
own
it
nearly
empty
now
said
the
girl
softly
it
bought
so
much
father
davy
i
begun
to
think
it
was
magic
gold
everybody
all
the
shopgirls
and
women
have
helped
me
spend
it
it
was
as
if
they
knew
i
must
make
it
go
a
long
way
and
wanted
to
do
it
i
really
think
she
gave
a
tremulous
little
laugh
it
was
a
good
thing
i
was
dressed
to
match
the
car
i
came
in
or
they
never
would
have
taken
the
trouble
to
hunt
up
the
things
i
wanted
at
the
prices
i
could
pay
the
fact
that
i
looked
like
a
shopgirl
too
was
such
a
help
a
shopgirl
repeated
her
father
you
my
dear
what
would
jefferson
say
to
that
no
matter
how
you
were
dressed
you
could
not
possibly
look
anything
but
what
you
are
oh
but
father
davy
dear
you
do
know
what
many
and
many
of
the
shopgirls
especially
these
city
girls
look
like
there
are
such
beautiful
faces
among
them
such
soft
voices
such
really
charming
manners
of
course
there
are
plenty
of
the
other
kind
the
cheap
and
common
sort
but
so
many
of
the
nice
kind
i
do
mind
looking
like
some
of
them
indeed
i
do
and
the
fact
that
i
wearing
this
little
old
summer
serge
suit
now
in
december
with
this
hat
which
any
clever
girl
would
know
i
made
myself
well
it
has
helped
me
to
interest
their
sympathies
in
my
search
and
now
i
found
her
voice
sank
found
what
i
could
have
expected
to
find
in
all
new
york
and
i
so
glad
so
glad
i
ca
tell
you
look
she
slowly
unwrapped
a
long
slim
cylinderlike
parcel
and
brought
to
view
what
it
contained
inclosed
in
its
pasteboard
protector
to
keep
it
unwrinkled
in
its
soft
perfection
lay
a
roll
of
dark
blue
silk
of
a
small
brocaded
pattern
georgiana
silently
laid
the
little
bag
upon
it
and
held
up
the
two
so
that
her
father
could
see
how
close
was
the
resemblance
the
colour
was
precisely
the
same
making
allowances
for
the
slight
dimming
of
age
while
the
design
of
the
brocade
was
so
similar
that
the
two
might
have
been
made
in
the
same
period
if
not
by
the
same
hand
warne
studied
the
two
fabrics
intently
for
a
moment
then
looked
into
his
daughter
eyes
he
was
too
moved
to
speak
when
she
herself
could
talk
again
composedly
she
told
him
what
she
meant
to
do
the
blue
silk
made
by
her
own
hands
in
the
three
days
left
her
was
to
be
her
wedding
gown
she
had
bought
a
little
fine
lace
fit
for
such
a
use
with
which
to
make
the
finishing
and
no
matter
what
doctor
jefferson
might
think
of
such
a
substitute
for
the
customary
bridal
attire
for
herself
she
should
be
far
happier
than
in
the
finest
white
silk
or
satin
that
could
be
bought
god
bless
you
my
little
girl
father
davy
murmured
wiping
his
eyes
their
clear
blue
depths
misty
his
thin
hand
clasped
the
little
blue
bag
again
his
heart
ached
with
the
sorrow
which
is
part
joy
and
with
the
joy
which
is
part
sorrow
nothing
his
phoebe
daughter
could
have
done
would
have
proclaimed
her
so
truly
the
child
of
her
mother
as
this
unexpected
act
he
looked
again
and
again
at
the
roll
of
blue
silk
in
georgiana
lap
how
strange
it
seems
that
you
could
find
it
he
said
now
when
everything
is
so
different
from
the
fashions
of
years
ago
it
a
revival
the
silk
man
said
he
explained
that
the
styles
of
the
moment
call
for
the
fabrics
and
patterns
of
the
past
and
that
it
a
constant
revolution
bringing
back
every
once
in
so
often
what
is
between
times
but
he
himself
was
surprised
that
the
very
newest
thing
on
his
shelves
was
the
one
that
matched
the
old
i
think
he
was
almost
as
pleased
as
i
was
without
knowing
anything
about
it
except
that
i
was
very
anxious
to
find
the
silk
and
now
to
hurry
home
and
make
it
her
unconscious
use
of
the
word
home
struck
pleasantly
upon
warne
ears
he
himself
was
beginning
to
feel
very
much
at
home
in
the
old
square
small
wonder
since
he
had
found
there
the
son
he
had
longed
for
all
his
married
life
back
at
the
house
georgiana
fell
to
work
without
delay
she
had
told
macfayden
her
intention
and
had
enlisted
the
warm
interest
of
that
motherly
scotswoman
she
had
offered
doctor
craig
young
guest
the
use
of
her
own
with
that
of
the
which
stood
there
and
here
presently
georgiana
unrolled
her
breadths
of
silk
and
laid
upon
them
the
pattern
she
had
selected
and
now
indeed
she
was
glad
of
the
long
training
in
the
trade
glad
of
the
clever
art
she
had
cultivated
for
so
many
years
it
was
to
her
a
simple
enough
matter
to
fashion
herself
a
dress
which
should
be
in
form
and
line
all
that
could
be
desired
to
do
it
out
of
unbroken
yards
of
material
without
necessity
for
piecing
and
patching
was
a
delightful
novelty
to
accomplish
it
in
three
days
was
only
a
matter
of
working
at
top
speed
with
fingers
which
flew
at
the
behest
of
a
brain
which
also
worked
like
magic
at
its
task
during
this
period
doctor
craig
himself
was
more
than
ordinarily
busy
to
judge
by
his
infrequent
appearances
at
his
home
for
those
last
three
days
before
his
marriage
he
was
out
of
town
returning
only
on
the
evening
preceding
the
date
set
but
georgiana
found
no
lack
in
him
as
a
lover
for
during
the
brief
moments
when
he
could
be
with
her
he
made
the
most
of
his
opportunity
letting
her
see
plainly
that
she
was
always
in
his
thoughts
and
giving
her
every
evidence
that
he
was
the
happiest
of
expectant
bridegrooms
each
day
a
great
box
of
flowers
was
brought
to
her
in
which
she
revelled
as
she
had
only
dreamed
of
doing
while
he
was
away
he
called
her
up
each
evening
on
the
telephone
managing
to
send
her
somehow
over
the
wire
a
sense
of
his
nearness
and
his
devotion
altogether
those
few
days
brought
to
georgiana
an
experience
unique
in
a
lifetime
and
one
which
she
would
gladly
have
prolonged
then
it
seemed
quite
suddenly
it
was
wednesday
morning
and
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
in
at
georgiana
windows
over
a
thousand
the
marriage
was
to
occur
at
noon
because
for
a
bride
whose
bridal
finery
was
limited
to
a
little
frock
of
dark
blue
silk
and
whose
traveling
attire
was
the
plainest
of
suits
and
simplest
of
small
hats
without
furs
or
furbelows
of
any
sort
it
seemed
the
only
fitting
hour
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
two
essential
witnesses
to
the
ceremony
should
be
two
close
friends
of
doctor
craig
an
elderly
couple
whose
name
if
the
warnes
had
known
was
one
of
the
old
names
of
the
city
standing
for
the
bluest
of
blue
knickerbocker
blood
though
for
only
moderate
wealth
and
for
no
ostentation
whatever
georgiana
had
begged
that
no
other
guests
be
asked
being
anxious
on
her
father
account
to
have
the
whole
affair
over
with
the
least
possible
agitation
for
him
to
this
doctor
craig
had
cordially
agreed
at
eleven
however
a
third
guest
arrived
a
most
unexpected
guest
who
with
a
ruddy
eager
face
came
running
up
the
old
stone
steps
of
the
house
a
great
florist
box
under
his
arm
he
demanded
of
the
boy
thomas
instant
entrance
and
waved
back
at
a
taxicab
driver
the
summons
to
bring
along
a
much
larger
box
which
was
nearly
filling
that
vehicle
georgiana
peeping
out
of
her
father
window
beheld
and
was
off
and
down
the
stairs
before
thomas
could
fairly
begin
his
explanation
that
miss
warne
was
engaged
and
could
not
be
intruded
upon
at
this
hour
o
jimps
well
well
george
you
came
pretty
near
giving
me
the
slip
you
but
not
quite
thanks
to
doctor
craig
georgiana
showed
her
surprise
did
he
let
you
know
she
had
led
him
instantly
inside
the
library
and
had
unconsciously
closed
the
door
all
but
in
the
face
of
the
interested
thomas
ignoring
both
florist
box
and
big
package
which
that
young
man
would
have
brought
in
to
her
she
had
both
hands
on
james
stuart
shoulders
and
was
looking
him
straight
in
the
eyes
which
looked
as
straightly
back
if
there
had
ever
been
the
beginning
of
romance
between
these
two
clearly
it
was
far
in
the
background
now
never
did
brother
and
sister
face
each
other
with
their
relationship
more
clearly
defined
i
should
say
he
did
since
you
did
what
did
you
mean
by
trying
to
steal
a
march
on
us
all
like
this
jeannette
is
furious
though
of
course
she
is
strong
enough
to
come
wild
though
she
is
to
do
it
she
wanted
me
to
tell
you
that
she
have
revenge
when
she
gets
about
and
that
you
wo
escape
her
wedding
presents
meanwhile
she
sent
you
something
she
had
on
hand
because
there
was
no
time
to
get
anything
else
she
thought
you
would
find
a
use
for
it
somehow
she
sent
her
love
with
it
and
i
can
tell
you
that
pretty
valuable
of
course
it
is
jimps
i
so
pleased
so
wonderfully
pleased
that
you
are
here
i
ca
tell
you
then
why
in
the
name
of
old
friendship
did
you
send
for
me
stuart
demanded
for
plainly
this
still
rankled
evidently
doctor
craig
had
more
belief
in
that
than
you
did
i
wanted
to
indeed
i
did
jimps
dear
but
i
thought
i
was
sure
well
stuart
laughed
thought
i
wanted
to
save
every
penny
for
my
own
wedding
eh
i
rather
guess
i
can
squander
a
few
on
yours
i
have
missed
it
for
worlds
though
i
give
a
good
deal
if
sweetheart
could
have
been
here
too
and
so
would
she
bless
her
coming
on
splendidly
george
looks
almost
herself
again
in
a
month
more
her
doctor
will
let
up
on
restrictions
they
talked
fast
with
an
eye
on
the
library
clock
and
when
its
deep
slow
chime
proclaimed
the
georgiana
rose
i
must
go
now
come
and
stay
with
father
till
the
hour
arrives
will
you
it
will
steady
him
to
see
you
not
but
that
he
seems
as
serene
as
ever
but
i
know
inside
it
a
pretty
big
strain
for
him
all
right
i
like
nothing
better
since
i
ca
see
you
any
longer
where
the
principal
man
for
this
occasion
anyhow
can
he
take
the
time
to
be
married
or
is
he
liable
to
send
up
word
he
detained
you
ca
put
your
finger
on
these
popular
surgeons
till
they
here
i
had
a
telephone
message
from
him
an
hour
ago
georgiana
assured
him
with
a
conscious
little
smile
i
really
think
he
be
here
though
not
till
the
last
minute
probably
if
he
is
i
go
after
him
with
a
gun
if
he
does
show
up
marry
you
myself
if
it
was
for
a
previous
engagement
dared
stuart
with
a
happy
laugh
never
if
i
could
have
my
man
i
never
marry
anybody
she
whispered
as
she
turned
to
look
back
at
him
for
an
instant
her
hand
on
the
library
door
stuart
caught
the
hand
and
whispered
back
george
is
it
like
that
with
you
too
she
nodded
his
face
flamed
it
wonderful
is
it
unbelievable
she
nodded
again
they
looked
into
each
other
faces
smiling
through
a
mist
of
happiness
then
georgiana
flung
open
the
door
and
ran
out
into
the
hall
stuart
followed
caught
up
the
big
box
and
ran
after
her
up
the
stairs
here
he
said
under
his
breath
as
they
reached
the
top
be
sure
to
open
this
before
you
go
jean
wanted
you
to
wear
it
away
with
you
she
said
you
be
sure
to
need
it
traveling
it
a
beauty
it
just
came
home
for
her
he
gave
her
the
big
box
at
the
door
of
her
room
while
she
pointed
him
down
the
hall
to
her
father
door
he
patted
her
arm
with
a
brotherly
gesture
and
hurried
along
inside
her
room
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
she
opened
the
box
under
the
tissue
lay
a
soft
mass
all
dark
blue
cloth
of
a
velvety
texture
with
glimpses
of
dark
fur
she
opened
it
with
a
sigh
of
pleasure
for
it
meant
that
now
she
might
look
fit
to
be
jefferson
craig
traveling
companion
with
this
cloak
to
slip
on
over
the
plain
little
suit
which
was
not
half
warm
enough
for
severe
winter
weather
it
the
last
of
my
she
said
to
herself
and
the
best
how
dear
of
her
and
oh
how
good
it
is
that
jimps
is
here
now
i
have
a
family
a
real
family
to
see
me
married
a
father
and
a
brother
the
clock
again
warning
her
to
fly
she
had
ever
been
rapid
at
dressing
she
had
never
been
quicker
a
cold
plunge
the
second
that
morning
bringing
the
blood
leaping
the
donning
of
fair
garments
lying
ready
to
her
hand
the
arrangement
of
hair
in
the
old
way
simplicity
itself
then
the
slipping
over
her
white
shoulders
of
the
blue
silk
gown
when
it
was
fastened
georgiana
went
to
stand
by
her
window
looking
out
with
eyes
which
did
not
see
chapter
xxv
great
music
wull
ye
be
comin
soon
miss
warne
said
the
voice
of
macfayden
at
her
door
georgiana
opened
it
quickly
and
the
housekeeper
entered
quietly
resplendent
in
black
silk
with
fine
lace
collar
and
cuffs
her
hair
in
shining
order
an
expression
of
great
solemnity
on
her
face
and
peter
brandt
are
here
she
announced
with
impressiveness

a
gled
day
for

miss
warne
an
for
us
a
georgiana
advanced
her
heart
very
warm
toward
this
good
woman
who
as
she
well
knew
was
quite
as
much
the
friend
of
jefferson
craig
as
his
housekeeper
and
well
esteemed
even
beloved
by
him
the
girl
came
close
macfayden
she
said
very
low
i
have
no
mother
to
kiss
me
before
i
go
down
may
i
the
sentence
was
left
unfinished
for
with
one
step
forward
mary
macfayden
opened
wide
her
arms
and
for
a
long
minute
the
two
enfolded
each
other
while
both
hearts
beat
strongly
then
georgiana
suddenly
mindful
that
she
must
not
let
go
for
an
instant
of
her
pressed
a
kiss
upon
the
fair
smooth
cheek
of
the
scotswoman
received
one
equally
warm
upon
her
own
and
drew
away
smiling
thank
you
she
murmured
uncertainly
i
could
go
without
it
thet
ye
could
na
lassie
responded
macfayden
heartily
noo
wull
i
send
the
doctor
up
just
in
a
minute
when
i
have
seen
my
father
georgiana
ran
into
his
room
from
her
own
a
deep
embrace
a
lingering
kiss
while
james
stuart
looked
out
of
the
window
a
lump
suddenly
appearing
from
nowhere
in
his
sturdy
throat
then
georgiana
said
softly
at
the
young
man
elbow
thank
you
again
for
coming
jimps
it
such
a
comfort
to
have
my
brother
here
before
he
could
reply
she
was
gone
again
he
led
warne
downstairs
where
doctor
craig
presented
them
both
to
the
brandts
delightful
people
stuart
thought
them
too
so
simple
and
unaffected
almost
like
village
people
as
he
stood
waiting
with
them
in
the
same
dignified
big
room
which
he
had
been
in
before
he
went
upstairs
he
was
conscious
that
in
his
brief
absence
its
character
had
changed
library
though
it
still
was
with
its
massive
bookcases
filled
with
rows
upon
rows
of
finely
bound
books
it
had
taken
on
a
festal
air
great
bowls
of
roses
deep
crimson
glowing
pink
rich
amber
had
been
brought
in
they
stood
on
table
and
floor
hundreds
of
them
it
seemed
to
him
there
must
be
he
realized
that
georgiana
herself
could
not
have
seen
them
they
would
be
a
surprise
to
her
evidently
the
simple
little
wedding
was
to
have
a
character
all
its
own
with
the
quiet
departure
of
jefferson
craig
from
the
room
james
stuart
was
all
eyes
for
an
appearance
at
the
door
how
would
georgiana
come
to
her
marriage
in
shimmering
white
he
supposed
for
that
was
the
traditional
garb
of
all
the
brides
he
had
ever
seen
mostly
village
girls
they
were
once
while
at
college
he
had
attended
a
city
wedding
that
of
a
classmate
who
had
not
been
willing
to
wait
till
his
college
course
was
finished
stuart
remembered
how
pale
the
bride
had
been
she
had
looked
as
if
she
were
going
to
faint
he
hoped
georgiana
would
not
look
like
that
he
could
not
conceive
it
the
next
moment
he
saw
her
entering
the
wide
door
on
doctor
arm
the
same
georgiana
he
had
always
known
as
simply
dressed
even
more
simply
he
thought
though
he
had
little
time
for
looking
at
her
dress
so
held
was
his
gaze
by
her
face
never
could
he
have
conceived
so
radiant
a
bride
and
then
he
thought
jefferson
craig
had
gone
up
alone
to
bring
her
down
stuart
wondered
if
he
himself
could
make
jeannette
look
like
that
at
such
a
moment
he
thought
he
could
georgiana
looked
into
father
davy
eyes
as
she
stood
before
him
he
was
not
tall
his
face
was
almost
on
a
level
with
her
own
it
seemed
to
her
she
had
never
seen
eyes
so
clear
so
blue
so
comprehending
her
own
never
left
them
for
a
moment
while
the
service
lasted
until
the
closing
prayer
father
davy
voice
at
first
very
slightly
tremulous
gathered
force
as
he
went
on
with
the
words
he
had
spoken
so
many
times
but
never
as
he
was
speaking
them
now
to
his
child
to
phoebe
child
and
to
the
man
of
her
choice
a
little
flush
crept
into
his
thin
cheeks
more
than
once
his
eyes
rested
on
the
silk
which
covered
his
shoulders
the
sight
of
it
seemed
to
give
him
strength
when
the
service
ended
and
his
voice
sank
into
the
words
of
prayer
the
hand
of
peter
brandt
went
for
a
moment
to
his
eyes
macfayden
felt
suddenly
for
her
handkerchief
james
stuart
softly
cleared
his
throat
winking
once
or
twice
rather
rapidly
never
had
any
of
them
heard
just
such
a
prayer
as
that
it
was
as
if
he
who
made
it
were
very
near
the
invisible
presence
whom
he
so
tenderly
and
trustingly
addressed
stuart
never
forgot
the
moment
when
he
looked
for
the
first
time
into
the
eyes
of
jefferson
craig
newly
made
wife
for
one
instant
he
suffered
a
pang
of
jealousy
a
queer
irrational
feeling
it
was
as
if
he
had
lost
his
friend
as
if
this
creature
before
him
could
never
find
room
for
him
again
in
her
full
heart
but
he
knew
better
in
the
next
breath
for
she
lifted
her
face
ever
so
little
and
with
a
sense
of
deep
relief
he
gave
her
the
brotherly
kiss
she
thus
permitted
when
he
looked
at
jefferson
craig
he
found
that
the
keen
fine
eyes
were
regarding
him
with
a
very
friendly
intentness
and
he
wrung
the
hand
offered
him
as
he
would
have
wrung
the
hand
of
a
brother
you
the
luckiest
man
in
this
whole
big
town
declared
stuart
his
lips
had
been
dumb
before
georgiana
but
now
he
turned
to
her
again
george
there
no
use
trying
to
tell
you
how
i
feel
about
this
all
i
can
say
is
that
nothing
too
good
for
you
or
for
him
that
pretty
lame
but
whatever
eloquence
i
capable
of
is
tied
up
somewhere
i
ca
get
it
out
it
out
jimps
dear
she
assured
him
is
it
jefferson
it
certainly
is
jimps
craig
answered
heartily
it
was
for
just
that
genuine
feeling
that
i
sent
for
you
i
knew
we
could
spare
it
stuart
watched
the
pair
eagerly
during
the
next
hour
the
hour
during
which
the
little
party
sat
at
the
wedding
breakfast
which
followed
the
table
was
a
round
one
and
his
place
was
next
the
bride
so
he
missed
nothing
he
had
never
been
present
on
such
an
occasion
nor
could
have
guessed
the
beauty
and
charm
of
the
setting
wealth
and
art
can
give
it
was
perfection
itself
arranged
by
whose
hand
he
had
no
notion
but
he
understood
well
enough
by
whose
order
had
been
created
all
the
simple
elegance
which
so
well
suited
the
house
and
the
people
and
as
he
looked
at
georgiana
he
said
to
himself
she
fits
into
this
as
if
she
had
been
born
to
it
she
born
to
it
for
it
just
the
kind
of
thing
she
have
made
for
herself
if
she
had
the
means
no
show
no
fuss
just
niceness
and
it
the
sort
of
thing
my
wife
shall
have
somehow
even
in
the
country
before
long
this
there
she
know
how
there
no
patent
on
it
bless
her
how
george
deserves
this
if
only
jean
could
have
been
here
but
i
tell
her
i
get
it
over
to
her
and
she
understand
at
the
end
of
the
hour
the
car
was
at
the
door
and
georgiana
was
coming
down
the
stairs
in
her
traveling
clothes
her
bridal
bouquet
on
her
arm
how
those
splendid
roses
had
lighted
up
the
little
frock
i
no
bridesmaid
to
throw
it
to
she
said
extending
it
toward
stuart
will
you
take
it
to
jeannette
i
should
say
i
will
i
be
with
her
this
evening
she
made
me
promise
and
stuart
received
the
offering
with
a
glad
hand
a
long
silent
clinging
to
her
father
was
the
only
parting
embrace
for
this
girl
if
james
stuart
longed
for
one
of
his
own
after
these
years
of
friendship
he
was
obliged
to
be
content
with
the
lustrous
look
he
had
from
eyes
lifted
for
a
moment
to
his
as
georgiana
took
her
place
in
the
car
and
with
the
lingering
pressure
her
hand
gave
his
which
spoke
of
love
and
loyalty
then
she
was
gone
with
jefferson
craig
sending
back
at
stuart
a
special
brilliant
smile
of
gratitude
for
the
office
he
had
performed
that
of
taking
the
place
of
the
whole
group
of
young
people
usually
present
on
such
occasions
saying
with
bared
head
and
face
of
ardent
devotion
with
the
first
light
snowflakes
of
winter
falling
on
his
fair
hair
i
ca
believe
i
quite
awake
said
georgiana
by
and
by
she
sat
in
one
of
the
of
a
fast
train
the
door
closed
the
curtains
drawn
between
herself
and
the
rest
of
the
carful
of
passengers
and
only
the
flying
landscape
beyond
the
window
to
tell
of
the
world
outside
craig
sat
watching
her
he
seemed
able
to
do
nothing
else
in
his
face
was
the
most
joyous
content
there
seemed
almost
a
light
behind
it
not
awake
was
his
amused
comment
i
wonder
why
now
i
feel
tremendously
awake
after
a
long
uneasy
sleep
in
which
i
dreamed
of
losing
what
i
most
wanted
but
it
not
all
strange
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
i
ca
quite
believe
that
there
nothing
on
my
shoulders
no
care
no
anxiety
just
well
shoulders
oh
but
she
went
on
hastily
do
think
that
means
i
want
you
to
carry
everything
for
me
indeed
i
do
i
want
to
carry
half
ah
but
that
it
he
answered
my
shoulders
for
your
burdens
yours
for
mine
that
way
neither
of
us
will
feel
half
the
weight
of
either
i
not
pretending
that
i
shall
give
you
a
life
of
wholly
sheltered
ease
it
wo
be
that
and
you
do
want
it
not
in
this
world
but
you
shall
have
some
things
that
you
have
been
denied
my
brave
girl
georgiana
i
ca
tell
you
how
it
touched
me
the
dress
you
made
to
be
married
in
her
eyes
went
down
now
before
the
look
in
his
i
tell
you
fairly
that
i
longed
with
all
my
heart
to
take
you
to
some
place
worthy
of
your
beauty
and
find
a
wedding
gown
for
you
not
necessarily
a
very
costly
one
but
one
that
should
bring
out
all
you
are
capable
of
showing
but
when
i
saw
you
looking
just
yourself
in
the
silk
that
was
like
your
mother
he
leaned
forward
taking
both
her
hands
in
his
and
looking
straight
into
her
face
compelling
her
gaze
to
lift
to
his
lest
she
should
miss
what
she
knew
was
there
i
felt
something
inside
my
heart
break
wide
open
with
worship
for
you
little
strong
splendid
spirit
that
you
are
he
pressed
the
hands
against
his
lips
then
he
touched
two
rings
upon
her
left
hand
exquisite
and
rare
jewels
were
set
in
both
engagement
and
wedding
rings
after
the
modern
fashion
but
there
was
a
third
ring
there
guarding
the
others
a
slender
band
of
gold
worn
thin
by
many
years
of
hard
work
the
ring
which
david
warne
had
placed
years
ago
upon
the
hand
of
his
bride
jefferson
craig
studied
all
three
turning
them
round
and
round
upon
the
rosy
finger
they
encircled
presently
he
spoke
again
very
gently
my
rings
on
your
hand
mean
to
me
love
and
beauty
loyalty
and
truth
but
her
ring
stands
for
all
that
and
service
we
need
it
there
to
remind
us
what
we
owe
the
world
we
live
in
she
paid
her
debt
we
pay
ours
in
memory
of
her
bless
her
for
giving
me
her
daughter
for
a
minute
georgiana
could
not
speak
then
with
her
dark
eyes
sparkling
through
the
mist
of
tears
which
had
taken
her
unawares
she
seized
his
hand
and
lifted
it
to
press
her
glowing
cheek
against
it
saying
passionately
oh
you
understand
they
were
silent
for
a
long
time
after
that
while
the
train
flew
on
through
the
gathering
darkness
of
the
late
december
afternoon
into
the
night
georgiana
had
supposed
that
they
were
to
go
at
once
to
the
old
home
for
she
knew
that
craig
could
not
be
long
away
at
this
time
and
there
was
much
to
do
there
but
she
found
that
instead
of
changing
trains
in
the
great
city
sixty
miles
beyond
which
lay
the
home
village
they
were
leaving
the
station
to
be
conveyed
in
a
waiting
car
to
a
hotel
if
you
had
been
spending
all
these
years
in
cities
was
explanation
i
should
have
felt
like
plunging
at
once
with
you
into
the
solitude
but
as
it
is
well
i
wondered
if
we
should
like
to
hear
some
great
music
do
you
feel
as
i
do
that
there
are
times
when
nothing
but
music
can
speak
for
you
but
you
she
said
who
live
in
the
rush
all
the
time
there
no
rush
here
for
me
he
answered
nobody
is
likely
to
know
me
here
i
can
forget
the
whole
world
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
with
you
as
for
the
music
i
been
on
short
rations
a
good
while
myself
i
think
we
can
feast
together
do
you
it
was
all
a
fairy
tale
to
georgiana
that
evening
in
the
city
her
college
days
had
been
spent
in
a
small
college
town
which
though
it
had
lain
not
many
miles
away
from
this
same
great
metropolis
had
seldom
seen
her
leave
it
for
the
privileges
which
richer
girls
enjoyed
at
every
as
for
the
superb
hotel
to
which
craig
took
her
although
she
had
seen
its
impressive
front
she
had
never
so
much
as
stood
within
its
stately
lobby
now
she
experienced
all
sorts
of
queer
little
thrills
as
she
watched
the
accustomed
ease
with
which
her
husband
led
her
through
the
brief
details
of
arrival
and
noted
with
what
deference
he
was
received
evidently
he
had
been
expected
for
there
was
no
delay
in
the
smooth
service
which
took
them
to
an
apartment
reserved
by
wire
as
georgiana
gathered
from
a
word
she
overheard
he
was
quite
right
a
touch
of
this
was
what
she
needed
as
a
bird
long
confined
needs
a
chance
to
stretch
its
wings
to
this
girl
with
vivid
life
stirring
in
her
pulses
the
unaccustomed
experience
could
but
be
a
delight
with
such
a
companion
to
show
her
the
way
every
detail
had
its
own
fascination
such
as
might
never
come
again
when
she
should
be
more
wonted
to
such
scenes
the
dinner
served
in
their
own
small
the
flowers
which
crowned
the
table
the
blithe
talk
craig
made
during
the
little
feast
with
all
its
pretty
ceremonious
detail
of
service
finally
the
short
drive
to
the
place
where
the
great
music
as
craig
had
called
it
was
to
be
heard
it
all
made
a
richly
enchanting
picture
in
georgiana
mind
when
at
length
she
sat
beside
her
husband
in
the
immense
silent
audience
listening
to
such
splendid
harmonies
as
only
once
or
twice
in
her
lifetime
she
had
heard
before
her
heart
was
far
too
full
for
words
he
did
not
ask
them
of
her
understanding
something
of
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
though
not
even
his
more
than
ordinary
powers
of
sympathy
could
have
guessed
at
all
that
held
her
breathless
through
those
hours
of
supreme
delight
certain
words
of
a
psalm
which
she
had
often
heard
her
father
quote
came
into
her
mind
and
repeated
themselves
over
and
over
she
had
smiled
with
a
bitter
irony
sometimes
when
she
had
heard
him
speak
them
in
a
tone
of
utter
thankfulness
while
she
had
been
quite
unable
to
imagine
how
he
could
use
them
of
himself
but
now
now
surely
they
applied
to
her
along
with
the
sweep
of
the
conductor
baton
with
the
rise
and
surge
of
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
symphonies
ran
the
triumphant
words
of
the
singer
of
old
time
hast
set
my
feet
in
a
large
surely
it
was
a
large
room
into
which
from
a
cramped
and
restricted
one
she
had
emerged
she
would
do
small
honour
to
the
devout
life
which
had
so
long
been
lived
beside
her
if
she
should
fail
to
give
the
praise
to
the
maker
of
all
life
who
according
to
her
father
firm
belief
had
known
from
the
beginning
all
for
which
he
had
been
so
wisely
fitting
her
chapter
xxvi
salt
water
it
was
the
tenth
day
of
april
a
great
ship
was
making
ready
to
sail
she
lay
like
some
inert
monster
at
her
pier
while
all
about
her
within
and
without
was
apparent
commotion
yet
really
ordered
haste
the
customary
scene
of
bustling
activity
few
passengers
had
yet
arrived
for
the
time
of
sailing
was
still
some
hours
away
one
party
of
three
however
had
just
driven
down
to
the
very
gangway
allowed
by
some
special
privilege
a
closer
approach
than
most
at
this
hour
the
reason
was
apparent
when
the
party
alighted
for
one
of
its
number
was
clearly
an
invalid
a
man
with
curly
gray
hair
who
leaned
upon
the
arm
of
a
much
younger
man
with
a
keen
distinguished
face
the
third
person
was
a
young
woman
the
sort
of
young
woman
who
looks
as
if
no
buffeting
wind
could
blow
her
away
because
she
would
be
sure
to
face
it
with
delight
her
eager
face
only
glowing
the
brighter
for
the
conflict
this
is
the
advantage
of
coming
early
is
it
said
jefferson
craig
with
a
look
of
congratulation
at
her
husband
it
not
much
as
it
was
when
we
saw
and
brandt
off
last
week
you
can
walk
on
board
as
slowly
as
you
please
father
davy
there
no
one
to
push
david
warne
was
drawing
deep
breaths
of
the
salty
air
with
its
peculiar
mixture
of
odours
he
was
also
gazing
about
him
with
delighted
eyes
seeming
in
no
haste
to
cross
the
gangway
when
i
was
a
boy
he
said
to
his
daughter
who
remained
close
at
his
side
i
lived
as
you
know
in
a
seaport
town
ever
since
i
came
away
it
seems
to
me
i
have
been
longing
to
smell
that
salty
marshy
briny
smell
again
it
takes
me
back
how
it
takes
me
back
the
voyage
is
going
to
do
you
worlds
of
good
exulted
georgiana
her
eyes
bright
with
hope
jefferson
was
quite
right
the
winter
at
home
to
help
the
poor
spine
now
the
sea
air
and
the
complete
change
to
make
you
strong
we
have
you
marching
back
and
forth
with
the
other
learned
men
under
the
lindens
at
trinity
while
we
are
in
oxford
hands
clasped
behind
your
back
impressive
nose
in
air
the
very
picture
of
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
as
if
there
were
anything
of
the
scholar
about
me
murmured
warne
smiling
at
this
picture
of
his
undistinguished
self
well
my
children
i
suppose
you
are
ready
to
go
on
and
i
imagine
we
are
not
wanted
in
the
way
here
let
us
proceed
across
that
little
bridge
and
then
we
can
look
back
at
all
this
interesting
activity
half
an
hour
later
having
taken
possession
of
their
staterooms
the
party
returned
to
the
deck
where
georgiana
and
her
husband
established
warne
in
his
chair
well
tucked
up
in
rugs
for
the
april
air
though
balmy
was
treacherous
they
then
fell
to
pacing
up
and
down
according
to
the
irresistible
tendency
of
the
human
foot
the
moment
that
it
treads
the
deck
he
seems
deliciously
happy
does
he
said
georgiana
voice
in
her
husband
ear
if
he
were
instead
of
he
enter
into
it
all
with
more
zest
how
pleased
he
was
with
flowers
and
how
dear
it
was
of
her
to
send
them
to
him
however
happy
he
may
be
declared
jefferson
craig
it
not
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
he
is
so
happy
as
we
oh
of
course
not
agreed
georgiana
to
this
decidedly
boyish
speech
she
realized
suddenly
how
quickly
the
sense
of
relaxation
from
care
was
beginning
to
show
in
her
husband
her
hand
within
his
arm
gave
it
a
warm
little
squeeze
that
could
be
expected
to
be
torn
apart
at
any
and
all
hours
and
kept
apart
day
after
day
just
when
we
most
want
to
be
together
and
then
to
come
down
to
a
big
ship
and
know
that
no
telephone
bell
can
ring
nobody
can
make
a
single
demand
upon
us
that
can
prevent
our
being
by
ourselves
well
words
simply
ca
express
how
wonderful
it
seems
it
wonderful
and
we
make
the
most
of
it
there
just
one
thing
i
want
to
get
out
of
this
vacation
in
the
way
of
work
and
then
all
the
rest
of
it
shall
be
at
your
service
the
book
the
book
how
did
you
guess
i
have
spoken
of
it
no
but
i
seen
you
looking
wistfully
at
your
notebook
time
and
again
and
guessed
what
you
were
thinking
of
well
we
can
make
it
fly
i
ready
for
you
georgiana
plunged
her
hand
into
a
small
bag
she
carried
on
her
arm
and
brought
forth
a
notebook
of
her
own
she
produced
a
pencil
you
may
as
well
begin
to
dictate
now
she
said
demurely
what
the
use
of
losing
time
just
do
go
too
fast
that
all
he
stared
at
her
what
do
you
mean
dear
you
do
know
shorthand
do
i
well
perhaps
i
can
write
fast
enough
in
long
hand
try
me
my
idea
is
he
said
that
we
might
spend
a
couple
of
hours
every
morning
and
another
couple
in
the
afternoon
if
you
do
mind
and
really
get
ahead
quite
a
bit
while
we
are
at
sea
provided
you
prove
a
good
sailor
which
i
have
an
idea
you
will
if
see
here
what
are
you
doing
you
not
taking
that
down
in
signs
he
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
the
notebook
where
a
series
of
dashes
angles
hooks
and
dots
was
forming
with
great
rapidity
you
do
mean
to
say
no
i
mean
to
write
and
let
you
do
the
saying
go
ahead
sir
only
be
sure
you
say
something
worth
while
but
you
did
have
that
accomplishment
when
we
worked
together
last
summer
how
i
did
wish
i
had
though
you
kept
insisting
that
i
was
doing
all
i
could
for
you
by
copying
endlessly
but
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
if
i
were
a
stenographer
you
could
accomplish
just
three
times
as
much
in
a
given
time
as
you
did
you
know
perfectly
well
you
only
took
that
course
to
give
a
poor
girl
the
chance
to
earn
if
it
had
been
for
helping
me
you
would
have
had
a
secretary
at
your
elbow
after
you
got
to
the
point
of
needing
him
i
took
that
course
as
you
well
know
because
i
wanted
you
at
my
elbow
if
you
had
been
able
to
write
only
a
word
a
minute
i
should
have
wanted
you
there
just
the
same
she
gave
him
a
merry
understanding
look
then
read
him
the
words
he
had
just
spoken
from
her
book
where
in
the
world
did
you
learn
and
how
he
demanded
and
how
have
you
become
so
proficient
in
so
short
a
time
i
afraid
it
rather
blundering
work
yet
but
it
will
grow
better
all
the
time
why
i
been
taking
lessons
all
winter
dear
sir
at
the
best
shorthand
school
in
the
city
i
made
up
my
mind
that
it
was
the
thing
i
could
do
that
would
be
of
most
use
to
you
it
a
shame
that
a
man
who
is
doing
the
original
work
that
you
are
should
have
time
to
give
other
people
more
benefit
of
it
it
seemed
to
me
you
could
write
an
important
monograph
in
an
hour
if
you
just
had
me
at
hand
to
take
down
the
words
of
wisdom
as
they
fell
from
your
learned
lips
why
you
used
a
secretary
before
for
this
purpose
i
do
know
but
i
certainly
am
glad
you
have
it
insures
me
the
position
if
she
had
wanted
a
reward
for
long
and
severe
labours
she
had
it
in
his
look
other
men
dictate
such
papers
he
said
but
somehow
it
has
never
seemed
to
me
i
could
i
tried
it
once
or
twice
and
did
get
on
at
all
as
i
did
when
i
had
the
pen
in
my
fingers
but
with
you
it
may
be
different
it
will
be
different
she
told
him
confidently
you
going
to
become
used
to
my
being
so
much
a
part
of
you
that
you
can
think
as
if
you
were
using
my
brains
or
i
were
using
yours
which
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
i
admit
oh
we
going
to
accomplish
all
sorts
of
things
together
he
looked
down
into
her
eager
face
glowing
with
colour
the
dark
eyes
apparently
seeing
visions
which
gave
them
keen
delight
you
are
a
partner
worth
having
he
said
much
moved
i
knew
you
would
be
and
it
seemed
to
me
all
winter
that
no
wife
could
be
more
of
one
but
if
you
going
to
add
this
to
your
other
activities
you
will
make
yourself
even
more
indispensable
than
you
already
are
which
is
saying
much
she
could
hardly
wait
until
she
had
made
a
trial
of
this
new
form
of
partnership
the
ship
had
barely
turned
her
face
out
to
sea
parting
company
with
her
pilot
before
the
work
began
doctor
craig
had
secured
a
small
suite
of
staterooms
opening
upon
a
central
and
here
he
and
georgiana
could
be
sure
of
much
time
to
themselves
while
the
pair
were
engaged
warne
was
supremely
content
to
lie
in
a
sheltered
corner
of
the
deck
book
in
hand
reading
or
watching
the
ever
new
glory
of
sea
and
sky
or
talking
with
some
fellow
passenger
who
possessed
intelligence
enough
to
discover
what
manner
of
man
was
here
when
georgiana
ardent
as
a
child
in
her
joy
over
what
was
to
be
revealed
unpacked
a
small
portable
typewriter
and
set
it
upon
the
table
of
the
jefferson
craig
suddenly
caught
her
in
his
arms
my
blessed
girl
he
cried
this
too
what
have
you
done
with
your
winter
when
i
thought
you
were
spending
your
time
getting
acquainted
with
new
york
as
i
meant
you
to
do
you
and
brandt
were
supposed
to
be
seeing
everything
worth
seeing
on
those
morning
drives
were
you
shut
up
in
your
room
all
that
time
learning
machines
no
indeed
do
you
imagine
i
made
up
all
the
stories
i
told
you
of
those
expeditions
we
did
all
that
and
this
too
i
spent
only
an
hour
each
morning
at
the
school
the
rest
of
the
study
i
put
in
at
all
hours
many
of
them
were
when
i
was
waiting
for
you
doctor
craig
to
take
me
to
a
dinner
or
the
opera
my
notebook
lived
with
me
as
if
it
had
been
a
treasure
i
could
have
out
of
my
sight
it
was
just
that
i
never
was
so
proud
of
anything
i
learned
at
college
as
i
was
when
the
gruff
man
who
had
my
special
training
in
charge
told
me
i
would
make
a
stenographer
not
all
of
them
did
he
said
some
never
could
get
hold
of
it
or
acquire
any
speed
or
accuracy
just
give
me
a
year
and
i
put
down
your
thoughts
before
you
think
them
i
have
a
doubt
of
it
he
agreed
with
a
laugh
of
amusement
and
delight
thus
the
work
began
and
thus
it
proceeded
with
only
one
interruption
when
in
came
hours
of
moderately
bad
weather
to
georgiana
joy
she
proved
herself
the
sailor
her
husband
had
prophesied
but
her
father
was
not
so
fortunate
and
she
promptly
tucked
him
in
his
berth
where
she
kept
him
fairly
comfortable
until
the
rough
seas
quieted
when
he
was
recovered
he
lay
for
one
morning
on
the
couch
in
the
while
the
two
workers
resumed
their
task
here
he
seemed
to
slumber
much
of
the
time
but
in
reality
he
kept
rather
a
close
watch
on
the
absorbed
pair
whom
he
had
never
before
seen
thus
engaged
much
as
he
had
heard
of
their
labours
looking
up
suddenly
georgiana
discovered
the
blue
eyes
upon
her
and
when
her
flying
fingers
next
stopped
she
put
a
question
a
penny
for
your
thoughts
father
davy
do
we
work
together
rather
well
in
spite
of
my
being
such
a
novice
you
two
pull
excellently
well
in
double
harness
it
seems
to
me
he
responded
i
ca
see
that
either
is
taking
all
the
load
while
the
other
soldiers
and
lets
the
traces
slack
doctor
craig
looked
around
at
him
she
always
ahead
by
a
pair
of
ears
at
least
he
declared
with
a
laugh
but
i
hear
his
steady
pound
pound
at
my
side
and
i
afraid
going
to
get
a
shoulder
ahead
his
wife
explained
the
interest
the
pair
excited
on
shipboard
was
greater
than
georgiana
guessed
though
doctor
craig
was
quite
aware
of
it
somehow
or
other
the
word
had
gone
around
as
words
do
go
in
a
ship
company
as
to
the
literary
labours
they
were
engaged
in
and
as
jefferson
craig
name
was
one
known
to
more
people
than
georgiana
had
the
slightest
notion
of
there
was
cause
enough
for
the
attention
given
them
craig
noteworthy
personality
one
which
marked
him
anywhere
as
a
man
of
intellect
and
action
georgiana
fresh
young
beauty
her
spontaneous
low
laughter
as
she
paced
the
deck
at
her
husband
side
her
readiness
to
make
friends
with
those
whose
looks
and
bearing
attracted
her
these
attributes
made
the
craigs
the
target
for
all
eyes
i
never
saw
people
who
looked
so
absolutely
content
fretfully
murmured
one
swathed
mummy
in
a
deck
chair
to
another
as
the
pair
passed
them
on
the
tenth
round
of
a
long
tramp
one
gray
morning
when
the
wind
was
more
than
ordinarily
chill
the
speaker
black
eyes
heavily
lidded
in
a
pale
discontented
face
followed
the
craigs
out
of
sight
as
she
spoke
oh
they
on
their
honeymoon
that
accounts
for
it
replied
the
other
languidly
her
glance
also
had
followed
the
walkers
no
they
not
i
told
you
that
before
they
were
married
last
december
plenty
of
time
for
the
glamour
to
wear
off
they
act
as
if
they
never
expected
it
to
wear
off
sue
burlison
must
hate
to
look
at
them
she
certainly
had
her
mind
made
up
to
marry
jefferson
craig
if
it
could
be
done
so
did
ursula
brandywine
contributed
the
languid
one
you
could
say
that
of
a
dozen
twenty
i
presume
there
are
at
least
four
disappointed
mothers
on
board
besides
jane
burlison
not
that
any
of
them
ever
had
much
encouragement
from
him
i
say
that
for
him
they
about
given
him
up
as
hopeless
when
he
went
off
and
married
this
country
girl
one
thing
is
certain
in
spite
of
her
fine
clothes
she
has
the
air
his
wife
ought
to
have
she
not
his
equal
what
that
you
say
the
questioner
was
a
youth
upon
the
lady
other
side
sunk
deep
in
a
coat
his
cap
pulled
low
over
his
eyes
which
were
precisely
like
hers
even
to
the
expression
of
discontent
he
had
seemed
for
the
last
hour
to
be
slumbering
but
at
the
moment
he
looked
quite
wide
awake
as
he
turned
his
head
toward
his
mother
and
challenged
her
latest
statement
that
you
say
he
repeated
in
her
own
acrimonious
tone
oh
have
you
come
to
at
last
she
inquired
it
is
quite
impossible
to
remember
that
though
you
sleep
for
hours
you
are
liable
to
wake
in
time
to
contradict
me
on
any
point
whatever
in
this
case
it
is
of
no
consequence
what
i
may
have
said
you
were
handing
us
the
hot
dope
about
craig
not
being
in
the
same
class
with
jeff
it
certainly
does
take
a
woman
to
stick
her
claws
into
another
woman
fur
there
one
thing
i
can
tell
you
there
is
a
man
on
board
who
agree
with
you
if
she
a
country
girl
you
can
say
for
me
to
the
little
old
town
i
going
to
take
to
rural
life
till
i
find
another
talk
about
peaches
and
cream
i
believe
i
did
not
mention
her
complexion
his
mother
observed
coldly
neither
did
your
little
son
though
it
would
bear
mentioning
i
should
say
yes
you
said
she
had
any
air
jupiter
there
she
comes
now
no
air
he
subsided
into
his
fur
collar
but
his
eyes
watched
intently
as
the
craigs
still
walking
briskly
after
at
least
an
exercise
came
up
the
deck
from
the
stern
his
mother
on
the
contrary
let
her
drooping
lids
fall
indifferently
the
moment
they
were
out
of
possible
hearing
the
young
man
sat
up
by
jove
if
you
call
that
no
air
tell
the
grande
dames
to
get
a
move
on
she
walks
like
a
young
goddess
that
what
silly
boy
nobody
is
talking
of
her
face
or
her
gait
if
you
do
know
what
i
mean
no
one
can
tell
you
oh
i
know
what
you
mean
her
son
assured
her
i
get
you
what
i
say
is
you
do
get
jefferson
craig
the
one
who
gets
her
lucky
chap
maybe
he
does
know
it
oh
no
maybe
not
and
turning
his
back
he
once
more
appeared
to
slumber
it
was
fortunate
for
georgiana
that
she
never
even
imagined
such
comments
though
she
passed
these
rows
of
critical
eyes
a
hundred
times
a
day
sat
at
table
with
people
who
were
keenly
observant
of
her
every
act
and
word
and
spent
some
reluctant
hours
in
the
society
of
those
who
strove
to
cultivate
her
for
their
own
blasé
enjoyment
she
only
knew
that
among
the
company
she
met
a
number
of
interesting
men
and
women
with
whom
she
and
her
husband
were
thoroughly
congenial
and
that
it
did
not
matter
in
the
least
about
the
rest
if
those
whom
she
liked
so
much
and
with
whom
she
could
talk
with
the
greatest
zest
turned
out
to
be
the
men
and
women
of
scientific
or
literary
achievement
this
seemed
only
natural
to
the
girl
and
she
cared
not
at
all
that
she
did
not
get
on
so
easily
with
those
whose
distinction
lay
in
purely
social
or
financial
lines
during
the
winter
just
past
her
experience
had
been
much
the
same
in
a
larger
way
her
husband
acquaintance
was
naturally
a
large
one
but
the
circle
of
his
real
friends
was
bound
almost
wholly
by
these
same
congenialities
of
mind
and
tastes
georgiana
had
met
and
been
entertained
by
many
people
whose
names
stood
high
on
the
list
of
the
distinguished
though
their
personal
fortunes
were
small
and
their
social
activities
were
ignored
in
the
society
columns
of
the
sunday
press
a
college
president
several
famous
surgeons
not
a
few
noted
authors
of
scientific
books
as
well
as
certain
social
workers
and
two
or
three
clergymen
these
with
their
wives
and
families
were
the
sort
of
people
who
gave
to
georgiana
craig
a
hearty
and
sincere
welcome
recognizing
her
at
once
as
one
who
belonged
to
them
it
was
small
wonder
that
the
young
wife
trained
in
a
school
of
life
in
which
nothing
counted
except
worth
and
ability
found
no
lack
nor
thought
of
sighing
for
the
privilege
her
husband
could
easily
have
given
her
had
he
cared
for
it
himself
of
mingling
with
a
quite
different
class
that
of
the
rich
and
gay
who
cared
for
little
except
that
which
could
give
them
the
most
powerfully
emotional
reactions
in
the
way
of
diversion
acquisition
or
notoriety
so
they
continued
to
work
and
walk
their
joyously
contented
way
across
the
wide
atlantic
during
the
six
days
between
port
and
port
georgiana
enjoyed
every
hour
from
that
early
morning
one
in
which
she
first
came
on
deck
running
up
with
her
husband
to
breathe
deeply
of
the
stimulating
sea
breeze
before
breakfasting
to
the
latest
one
when
furry
coat
drawn
hurriedly
on
over
her
pretty
evening
frock
her
dark
hair
lightly
confined
under
a
gauzy
scarf
she
with
craig
and
a
merry
of
the
evening
group
came
up
again
upon
a
deserted
deck
to
blow
the
society
fog
out
of
their
lungs
as
one
young
biologist
of
coming
reputation
put
it
in
the
silvery
april
moonlight
with
only
a
few
similarly
inclined
spirits
to
share
with
them
the
big
empty
spaces
i
shall
really
be
sorry
to
land
sighed
georgiana
leaning
upon
the
rail
on
the
last
night
of
the
voyage
and
staring
ahead
toward
the
quarter
where
her
husband
had
just
indicated
they
would
be
seeing
land
when
they
came
up
in
the
morning
it
has
been
so
perfect
this
being
off
between
the
sea
and
the
sky
together
when
shall
i
ever
forget
this
first
voyage
it
a
dream
come
true
you
will
enjoy
the
second
one
just
as
much
for
you
a
born
sailor
and
there
be
a
long
succession
of
voyages
for
you
to
look
back
upon
by
and
by
not
just
my
annual
pilgrimages
to
foreign
clinics
but
journeys
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
if
you
like
will
that
suit
you
one
suit
me
oh
wonderful
to
think
of
am
i
really
i
try
so
hard
to
cultivate
that
beautiful
calm
of
manner
i
admire
so
much
in
other
people
have
i
acquired
a
bit
of
it
yet
a
beautiful
calm
of
manner
all
that
could
be
desired
but
your
eyes
still
suggest
that
you
standing
on
tiptoe
with
your
face
lighted
by
the
dawn
craig
answered
contentedly
heaven
forbid
you
ever
lose
that
look

gives

zest

jefferson
craig
found
plenty
of
the
zest
which
he
had
told
georgiana
that
last
evening
on
shipboard
her
look
added
to
his
life
when
the
next
day
in
a
compartment
reserved
for
the
three
travelers
he
watched
her
as
she
fairly
hung
out
of
the
windows
all
through
devonshire
and
on
to
the
northeast
she
was
drinking
in
the
fair
and
ordered
beauty
of
the
english
countryside
in
april
exclaiming
over
apple
orchards
rosy
as
with
bloom
over
cottages
and
lanes
masses
of
wall
flowers
at
each
trim
station
and
such
green
fields
as
she
had
never
seen
in
her
life
father
davy
was
not
far
behind
her
in
his
quiet
enjoyment
of
the
unaccustomed
scenes
a
night
at
bath
picturesque
and
interesting
and
then
before
the
eldest
of
the
three
travelers
could
be
really
weary
they
were
in
famous
oxford
professor
pembroke
and
his
wife
allison
craig
met
them
at
the
station
to
convoy
them
to
the
comfortable
quarters
in
the
dignified
stone
house
near
magdalen
college
which
craig
had
more
than
once
described
to
georgiana
here
the
young
american
had
her
first
taste
of
a
manner
of
life
which
enchanted
her
from
the
moment
that
she
set
eyes
on
jefferson
sister
the
original
of
the
photograph
she
had
so
often
studied
with
a
constriction
of
the
heart
not
knowing
whose
it
was
she
was
drawn
to
her
as
she
had
never
been
drawn
to
any
other
woman
sitting
with
her
in
the
pleasant
walking
with
her
in
the
garden
which
was
like
no
garden
she
had
ever
imagined
she
was
conscious
of
a
stronger
sense
of
wonder
than
ever
that
a
man
whose
family
was
represented
by
a
sister
like
this
could
ever
have
chosen
the
crude
young
person
she
still
considered
herself
from
pembroke
however
she
received
only
assurance
of
her
welcome
and
her
fitness
my
dear
allison
said
as
the
two
stood
at
an
window
one
morning
looking
out
at
warne
and
his
as
they
slowly
paced
up
and
down
beneath
a
row
of
copper
beeches
between
house
and
garden
i
never
saw
my
brother
so
happy
in
his
life
jeff
always
was
hard
to
please
as
a
boy
i
used
to
think
it
was
merely
a
critical
disposition
but
later
i
discovered
that
it
was
his
extreme
distaste
for
all
artifice
acting
intrigue
all
absence
of
genuineness
only
those
boys
and
men
interested
him
whom
he
had
absolute
faith
in
i
do
mean
that
he
himself
was
a
far
from
it
he
was
a
terrible
prank
maker
and
more
than
once
narrowly
missed
suffering
serious
consequences
but
when
he
really
grew
up
and
it
came
to
an
acquaintance
with
women
very
few
have
even
attracted
him
i
began
to
fear
that
he
was
becoming
hardened
and
would
never
find
just
what
his
fastidious
taste
could
approve
not
to
mention
what
his
heart
might
soften
to
but
now
well
i
think
i
am
almost
as
happy
as
he
is
that
he
has
found
you
he
seems
like
a
different
being
to
me
and
evidently
it
is
you
who
have
wrought
the
miracle
i
surely
have
made
no
change
in
him
georgiana
protested
he
has
been
just
as
he
is
now
from
the
beginning
except
of
course
that
i
know
him
better
i
ca
imagine
him
hardened
to
anything
allison
pembroke
looked
at
her
smiling
she
was
herself
an
unusually
beautiful
woman
more
mature
than
georgiana
but
still
with
a
touch
of
girlishness
in
her
personality
which
made
her
very
appealing
to
her
young
guest
evidently
the
softening
process
began
the
moment
he
met
you
she
said
he
frankly
admits
that
himself
i
am
going
to
tell
you
what
he
wrote
to
me
last
winter
after
you
had
begun
your
work
with
him
feel
like
a
footsore
traveler
he
said
has
been
walking
for
many
miles
along
a
hot
and
crowded
highway
with
the
dust
heavy
on
his
shoulders
and
thick
in
his
throat
who
suddenly
finds
his
course
turned
aside
through
a
deep
and
quiet
wood
with
flowers
springing
on
all
sides
and
a
clear
stream
running
beside
him
where
he
may
bathe
his
flushed
face
and
cool
his
parched
throat
i
have
never
forgotten
the
words
because
they
struck
me
as
so
unlike
him
i
knew
then
that
something
had
happened
to
him
there
in
the
old
manse
and
when
i
saw
you
dear
i
did
wonder
that
he
chose
just
those
words
i
should
never
have
thought
murmured
georgiana
incredulously
that
i
could
ever
have
reminded
anybody
of
a
quiet
wood
i
with
my
hot
rebellion
at
having
to
spend
my
days
in
the
country
which
i
could
never
quite
cover
up
i
know
just
the
same
georgiana
after
having
known
so
many
artificial
women
posing
as
women
do
pose
for
a
man
in
jefferson
place
it
refreshed
his
very
soul
to
find
a
girl
like
you
who
dared
to
be
herself
from
head
to
foot
whether
she
pleased
him
or
not
and
oh
i
am
so
thankful
you
could
care
for
him
since
he
needed
you
so
much
such
talks
brought
these
two
very
close
together
it
was
a
happy
week
which
georgiana
spent
in
the
fine
classic
old
town
walking
or
driving
with
allison
exploring
quaint
winding
streets
ancient
halls
and
flowery
closes
or
meeting
interesting
people
of
all
ranks
from
the
chancellor
of
the
university
himself
to
the
young
undergraduates
who
offered
her
in
their
old
and
dingy
but
distinguished
rooms
tea
and
toasted
scones
along
with
their
admiration
not
the
least
of
her
pleasure
was
in
watching
father
davy
keen
enjoyment
of
everything
that
came
his
way
and
in
noting
how
many
of
these
english
people
seemed
to
find
him
one
of
them
in
his
appreciation
of
all
they
had
to
offer
and
in
his
intimate
knowledge
of
their
history
he
apparently
grew
a
little
stronger
with
each
succeeding
day
certainly
he
grew
younger
for
happiness
is
a
tonic
which
has
special
power
upon
those
who
carry
the
burden
of
years
and
father
davy
years
while
not
so
many
had
been
heavy
of
weight
upon
his
slender
shoulders
and
had
bowed
them
before
their
time
after
oxford
came
london
a
fortnight
of
it
and
a
very
different
experience
living
at
a
luxurious
hotel
with
allison
pembroke
who
had
come
up
with
them
to
show
her
all
the
ways
of
which
she
felt
herself
ignorant
with
craig
coming
and
going
from
hospital
and
lecture
room
suggesting
each
day
new
wonders
with
hours
spent
daily
in
the
dear
delight
of
exploration
in
all
sorts
of
famous
places
georgiana
felt
as
if
it
were
all
too
miraculous
to
be
true
that
she
georgie
warne
as
the
village
people
had
called
her
all
her
life
should
for
instance
be
walking
with
charming
pembroke
along
piccadilly
in
the
may
sunshine
real
london
sunshine
and
no
watery
imitation
such
as
she
had
heard
of
dressed
in
the
most
modish
of
spring
costumes
violets
in
her
belt
purchased
on
a
street
corner
from
a
young
girl
with
the
eyes
of
a
patrick
campbell
and
the
accent
of
battersea
park
well
it
simply
did
not
seem
real
much
less
did
the
hours
seem
real
when
she
went
with
her
husband
to
take
tea
on
the
terrace
at
the
houses
of
parliament
or
with
all
three
of
her
party
to
dine
with
some
friendly
londoner
who
appeared
eager
to
offer
hospitality
to
the
whole
party
best
of
all
perhaps
were
the
late
evening
walks
upon
which
craig
took
her
alone
to
stroll
along
the
victoria
embankment
a
place
of
which
she
never
tired
to
watch
the
myriad
lights
upon
the
black
river
and
to
talk
endlessly
of
all
the
pair
could
see
before
them
of
purpose
and
achievement
do
you
know
what
you
remind
me
of
these
days
craig
asked
one
night
when
the
two
had
returned
to
the
hotel
after
one
of
these
long
slow
walks
during
which
they
had
been
unusually
silent
he
threw
himself
into
a
deep
armchair
as
he
spoke
and
sat
looking
up
at
his
wife
who
stood
at
the
open
balcony
window
gazing
down
at
the
street
below
with
the
interest
in
everything
human
which
seemed
never
to
abate
she
turned
smiling
she
was
particularly
lovely
to
look
at
wearing
a
little
frock
lately
purchased
at
a
french
shop
in
london
which
in
spite
of
its
parisian
lines
and
graces
was
distinctly
reminiscent
of
a
certain
other
frock
worn
on
a
occasion
of
a
child
at
her
first
party
she
asked
that
what
i
feel
like
only
there
no
end
to
the
cakes
and
ices
the
bonbons
and
surprises
and
i
never
have
to
worry
because
before
long
i
must
go
home
no
not
like
that
your
similes
are
always
too
you
seem
to
me
more
and
more
like
a
young
queen
who
has
just
come
to
the
throne
but
who
is
shy
about
picking
up
her
sceptre
she
prefers
roses
and
every
now
and
then
she
catches
up
her
train
and
runs
down
from
her
dais
and
until
some
shocked
courtier
rushes
after
her
and
brings
her
back
now
you
laughing
at
me
georgiana
wheeled
to
confront
her
husband
who
stretched
lazily
in
his
chair
after
a
long
day
at
the
side
of
a
great
biologist
in
his
laboratory
was
relaxing
muscles
and
nerves
at
the
same
time
he
put
out
one
arm
toward
her
and
she
came
slowly
to
his
side
not
a
bit
it
just
delights
me
to
see
you
your
natural
self
in
spite
of
all
that
london
can
do
to
you
allison
tells
me
that
it
is
the
most
interesting
thing
in
the
world
to
watch
you
decide
whether
you
will
buy
a
new
hat
or
a
new
book
she
declares
that
milliners
admire
you
and
seem
anxious
to
please
you
but
that
when
you
get
into
a
bookshop
you
have
every
old
bookseller
climbing
about
his
ladders
to
bring
down
his
choicest
treasures
for
you
georgiana
laughed
i
ca
get
used
to
buying
hats
at
all
not
to
mention
silk
stockings
and
as
for
buying
hats
and
books
and
silk
stockings
on
the
same
day
it
simply
past
belief
that
i
can
do
it
why
do
you
fill
my
purse
so
full
i
afraid
i
losing
all
the
benefit
of
my
long
training
in
frugality
i
hope
so
i
can
never
forget
last
winter
watching
you
dissemble
your
good
healthy
appetite
and
pretend
you
did
want
beefsteak
while
you
fed
your
father
and
me
on
a
juicy
tenderloin
brave
little
housekeeper
on
nothing
a
month
she
looked
at
him
quickly
i
never
dreamed
you
noticed
and
besides
i
really
did
want
take
care
the
table
was
the
only
place
where
i
ever
caught
you
playing
a
part
i
forgave
you
only
how
i
did
long
to
divide
with
you
now
all
the
rest
of
my
life
i
can
divide
equal
shares
with
you
my
georgiana
the
weeks
flew
by
bringing
interest
after
london
came
edinburgh
city
of
stately
beauty
where
among
scottish
friends
of
the
craigs
georgiana
learned
whence
her
husband
family
had
sprung
and
their
noble
origin
and
history
then
the
vacation
was
at
an
end
for
this
time
as
craig
said
and
the
little
party
turned
their
faces
homeward
a
letter
from
james
stuart
in
the
same
mail
with
one
twice
its
length
from
jeannette
crofton
caused
them
to
hasten
their
date
of
sailing
by
a
week
in
order
to
be
in
time
for
a
great
event
stuart
wrote
characteristically
you
simply
have
to
come
home
george
and
help
me
through
it
of
course
i
knew
from
the
first
i
have
to
face
a
big
city
wedding
but
the
actual
fact
rather
daunts
me
of
course
it
all
right
for
we
know
jean
mother
would
never
be
satisfied
to
let
me
have
her
at
all
except
by
way
of
the
route
the
white
gloves
do
scare
me
so
much
as
the
orchids
and
i
suppose
my
new
tailor
will
turn
me
out
a
creditable
figure
but
if
i
ca
have
you
and
jeff
craig
there
i
do
believe
i
can
stand
the
strain
the
worst
of
it
is
that
after
all
that
show
i
can
only
take
her
back
to
the
old
farm
not
that
she
minds
in
fact
she
seems
to
be
crazy
about
that
farm
but
it
certainly
does
sound
to
me
like
a
play
called
from
orchids
to
dandelions
so
for
heaven
sake
come
home
in
time
the
date
had
to
be
shoved
up
on
account
of
some
who
intends
to
leave
jean
her
fortune
some
day
if
she
is
offended
now
and
the
nice
old
lady
wants
to
start
for
the
far
east
the
day
after
the
date
she
sets
for
our
affair
of
course
we
must
go
craig
agreed
we
stand
by
the
dear
fellow
till
the
last
orchid
has
withered
if
they
use
orchids
at
june
weddings
which
i
doubt
as
for
the
dandelions
i
think
there
small
fear
that
jean
wo
like
them
i
fully
believe
in
her
sincerity
and
i
prepared
to
see
her
astonish
her
family
by
her
devotion
to
country
life
able
to
keep
her
in
real
luxury
from
the
rural
point
of
view
as
i
understand
it
and
she
will
bring
him
a
lot
of
fresh
enthusiasm
that
will
do
him
a
world
of
good
i
trying
to
imagine
jimps
face
above
a
white
shirt
front
mused
georgiana
he
be
a
perfect
indian
shade
by
that
time
not
more
so
than
any
young
tennis
or
golf
enthusiast
will
he
oh
much
more
jimps
is
out
in
the
sun
from
dawn
till
sundown
his
very
eyebrows
get
a
russet
shade
but
of
course
that
does
matter
and
his
splendid
shoulders
certainly
do
fill
out
a
dress
coat
to
great
advantage
you
do
mind
being
considered
one
of
his
best
friends
by
a
young
farmer
do
you
that
the
way
he
feels
about
you
i
consider
it
a
great
honour
i
never
was
better
pleased
than
when
stuart
first
made
friends
with
me
even
after
i
discovered
that
he
was
as
i
thought
my
successful
rival
it
was
impossible
to
help
liking
him
in
fact
i
often
wondered
why
he
did
continue
to
be
my
rival
oh
no
jefferson
craig
you
could
possibly
wonder
that
contradicted
georgiana
in
such
a
tone
of
finality
that
her
husband
laughed
and
told
her
that
flattery
could
go
no
farther
the
voyage
home
was
nearly
a
duplicate
of
the
one
outward
bound
except
that
the
two
workers
put
in
much
extra
time
on
the
book
and
pushed
it
well
toward
completion
father
davy
acquired
the
strength
to
take
short
walks
on
an
even
deck
and
boasted
hugely
of
his
acquisition
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
a
tinge
of
real
colour
in
his
cheek
imagine
my
coming
home
from
abroad
with
trunks
full
of
clothes
and
books
and
pictures
murmured
georgiana
as
the
three
stood
together
watching
the
big
ship
make
her
port
i
feel
like
a
regular
millionairess
a
regular
one
would
smile
at
your
modest
showing
was
craig
comment
i
quite
certain
no
man
ever
found
it
more
difficult
to
persuade
his
wife
to
buy
frocks
even
when
he
went
with
her
and
expressed
his
anxiety
to
see
her
in
particular
colours
confess
demanded
georgiana
with
spirit
that
you
would
be
disappointed
if
i
suddenly
became
a
devotee
of
clothes
and
wanted
all
those
gorgeous
things
we
saw
and
which
that
frenchwoman
tried
so
hard
to
make
me
take
those
would
have
suited
you
of
course
i
do
want
to
make
an
actress
of
you
or
even
a
society
woman
who
gets
her
gowns
described
in
the
sunday
papers
but
when
you
refuse
simple
white
frocks
with
blue
ribbons
costing
three
figures
and
i
could
copy
every
one
of
those
myself
for
a
fraction
of
the
money
what
would
you
do
with
the
money
saved
buy
books
georgiana
and
father
davy
exchanged
a
smiling
tender
glance
which
spoke
of
past
years
of
longings
now
satisfied
craig
laughed
heartily
incorrigible
little
well
it
a
worthy
taste
i
happened
to
overhear
a
comment
on
your
reading
the
other
day
which
amused
me
very
much
when
you
left
your
steamer
chair
to
walk
with
me
you
left
also
a
copy
of
of
the
a
little
later
coming
up
behind
that
young
edmeston
who
spends
most
of
his
time
lounging
in
the
chair
next
yours
i
heard
him
say
to
a
girl
does
look
such
an
awful
highbrow
but
believe
the
things
she
reads
on
shipboard
when
the
rest
of
us
are
yawning
over
summer
novels
would
help
weight
the
anchor
if
we
got
on
the
rocks
then
with
awe
he
mentioned
the
name
of
that
book
and
the
girl
said
how
frightful
but
i
crazy
about
her
just
the
same
i
do
think
she
wears
the
darlingest
clothes
so
there
you
are
the
men
impressed
the
girls
envious
and
your
husband
worshipful
what
more
could
a
young
wife
ask
absolutely
nothing
acknowledged
georgiana
with
much
amusement
chapter
xxviii
a
tanned
hercules
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
holiday
was
over
it
was
good
to
get
back
to
the
old
house
on
the
square
to
hear
macfayden
warm
it
a
gled
day
to
smile
at
thomas
and
duncan
and
the
maids
to
hug
dear
brandt
and
to
receive
a
hearty
welcome
from
the
other
friends
who
were
mostly
still
in
town
in
the
middle
of
june
then
came
eager
summonses
from
jeannette
who
with
aunt
olivia
and
rosalie
was
staying
at
an
uptown
hotel
for
the
finishing
of
the
trousseau
georgiana
found
herself
involved
in
a
round
of
final
shopping
and
hurried
luncheons
while
rosalie
talked
incessantly
crofton
argued
maternally
and
the
herself
turned
to
georgiana
as
the
one
person
with
the
exception
of
her
father
who
understood
her
i
ca
convince
mother
and
rosy
that
i
not
really
to
spend
the
summer
in
the
country
with
jimps
and
most
of
the
rest
of
the
year
at
home
doing
the
usual
round
sighed
jeannette
unburdening
herself
to
her
cousin
during
a
needed
relaxation
between
luncheon
and
a
visit
to
a
famous
jeweller
i
know
you
just
have
to
be
patient
let
them
equip
you
for
what
they
expect
of
you
and
then
live
your
own
life
as
you
and
jimps
have
planned
it
after
a
while
they
will
see
that
you
really
do
mean
to
live
in
the
country
not
the
city
and
that
décolleté
evening
gowns
suit
the
fireside
nor
afternoon
calling
costumes
the
tramp
meanwhile
do
let
the
poor
boy
ever
guess
at
the
size
or
quality
of
your
outfit
i
think
he
run
away
and
hang
himself
he
never
shall
know
and
georgiana
i
really
have
managed
to
have
some
quite
simple
little
frocks
made
by
a
young
woman
whom
madame
trennet
recommended
when
i
whispered
in
her
ear
and
i
bought
the
jolliest
dark
green
corduroy
suit
with
a
short
skirt
and
pockets
and
a
little
green
corduroy
soft
hat
to
match
for
the
tramps
oh
i
going
to
be
a
real
farmer
wife
i
promise
you
of
course
mused
georgiana
gently
lifting
quizzical
eyebrows
never
happened
to
see
any
farmer
wife
thus
equipped
but
there
no
reason
why
you
should
set
the
fashion
i
suppose
you
will
wear
green
silk
stockings
and
bronze
pumps
with
this
picturesque
tramping
costume
with
a
bronze
buckle
in
your
hat
to
complete
the
ensemble
all
you
will
then
need
will
be
a
beautiful
painted
drop
of
the
forest
of
arden
you
unkind
thing
if
begin
to
scoff
but
i
wo
i
know
there
heaps
of
sense
in
your
pretty
head
and
you
make
jimps
the
most
satisfying
sort
of
a
wife
even
though
you
do
carry
the
eggs
to
market
or
milk
the
cows
there
no
reason
why
you
should
with
your
own
private
income
jimps
is
too
wise
to
forbid
your
spending
it
to
decorate
both
your
lives
for
he
knows
you
stand
real
wear
and
tear
while
a
reasonable
amount
of
country
life
will
make
you
stronger
go
ahead
dear
hang
english
chintzes
at
the
farmhouse
windows
set
up
your
baby
grand
piano
in
that
nice
old
and
hang
jolly
hunting
prints
in
the
wear
the
corduroys
only
instead
of
bronze
pumps
i
should
advise
you
need
i
got
them
the
heaviest
kind
of
tanned
buckskin
boots
and
you
all
may
laugh
but
you
just
wait
i
not
laughing
you
know
i
not
i
wish
i
could
help
you
by
convincing
aunt
olivia
that
you
do
need
some
of
the
things
she
insists
on
including
but
since
i
ca
i
comfort
you
by
assuring
you
that
jefferson
says
he
counting
on
your
being
one
of
the
sort
who
will
prove
the
great
contention
that
beauty
and
poetry
be
brought
into
the
farmhouse
thus
spoke
georgiana
though
in
her
heart
of
hearts
as
she
watched
jeannette
in
all
her
costly
elegance
at
counter
after
counter
selecting
supplies
of
one
sort
or
another
she
could
help
having
her
doubts
whether
a
lifelong
training
in
luxury
could
be
turned
into
a
fitness
for
living
in
spite
of
many
mitigations
the
truly
simple
life
these
doubts
however
she
suppressed
only
dropping
a
word
of
caution
here
and
there
which
jeannette
took
kindly
being
eager
to
prove
herself
practical
and
undoubtedly
sincere
in
her
longing
to
bring
to
james
stuart
the
helpmate
he
needed
so
came
on
the
great
day
and
when
it
had
arrived
and
the
craigs
were
guests
of
aunt
olivia
making
ready
for
the
ceremony
georgiana
had
her
chance
to
return
to
stuart
the
support
he
had
given
her
in
the
hour
of
her
own
marriage
she
had
just
completed
her
dressing
and
was
about
to
descend
with
her
husband
to
the
waiting
bridal
party
below
when
stuart
came
to
their
door
craig
admitted
him
and
he
entered
the
dreaded
white
gloves
in
his
hands
visible
agitation
on
his
brow
you
young
hercules
georgiana
cried
are
you
splendid
i
feel
anything
but
splendid
he
returned
nervously
i
look
like
a
boiled
lobster
on
a
white
platter
nonsense
man
denied
jefferson
craig
his
hand
on
shoulder
you
the
picture
of
a
healthy
young
bridegroom
i
seen
plenty
of
tallow
candles
standing
up
to
be
married
you
a
refreshing
contrast
after
a
minute
of
heartening
talk
craig
slipped
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
two
old
friends
together
cheer
up
jimps
georgiana
bade
stuart
as
she
gave
a
straightening
little
touch
to
his
white
cravat
woman
fashion
this
part
wo
last
long
and
do
be
frightened
when
you
catch
sight
of
jean
in
all
her
glory
she
would
much
rather
have
been
married
as
i
was
you
know
and
she
really
precisely
the
same
girl
in
spite
of
her
veil
she
worships
you
and
everything
all
right
stop
looking
as
if
you
wanted
to
run
away
but
i
do
if
i
could
just
take
her
with
me
he
answered
in
such
a
melancholy
tone
that
georgiana
laughed
in
his
ruddy
face
you
ca
this
is
the
only
way
you
can
get
her
so
stand
up
straight
and
look
everybody
in
the
eye
you
perfectly
stunning
in
those
clothes
and
lots
nicer
to
look
at
than
most
men
and
chester
will
take
you
serenely
through
all
the
forms
so
you
nothing
to
worry
about
that
right
give
me
a
ghost
of
a
smile
one
would
think
you
were
about
to
be
hung
i
came
to
you
to
be
braced
up
so
it
all
right
but
call
off
the
dogs
of
war
now
i
did
pretty
well
till
i
saw
the
total
effect
and
then
i
thought
maybe
jean
would
wish
she
had
a
man
who
could
turn
pale
instead
of
crimson
but
i
going
through
with
it
and
i
do
intend
to
look
knockkneed
anyhow
good
for
you
just
remember
that
jean
would
swim
through
a
flood
of
water
to
reach
you
wedding
gown
and
all
if
the
aisle
should
happen
to
be
inundated
so
you
certainly
can
stand
at
the
altar
while
she
walks
up
that
aisle
i
sure
can
and
james
mckenzie
stuart
shook
his
broad
shoulders
lifted
his
head
and
held
out
both
hands
to
georgiana
craig
much
obliged
for
the
tonic
and
george
just
remember
will
you
that
precisely
the
same
brother
to
you
i
always
been
nothing
can
ever
change
that
of
course
you
are
she
agreed
with
a
rush
of
vivid
recollections
which
brought
a
curious
little
smile
to
her
lips
now
go
my
dear
boy
and
heaven
bless
you
half
an
hour
later
standing
beside
her
husband
in
the
church
georgiana
watched
with
a
beating
heart
to
see
stuart
bear
himself
like
the
man
she
knew
him
to
be
in
spite
of
all
the
pomp
and
ceremony
to
which
he
was
such
a
stranger
she
had
been
half
angry
all
the
way
through
the
preparations
that
aunt
olivia
had
insisted
on
every
last
detail
of
formality
and
ostentation
or
so
it
had
seemed
to
her
as
unaccustomed
as
stuart
himself
to
the
great
church
wedding
with
its
long
processional
its
show
of
bridesmaids
and
flower
girls
its
ranks
of
ushers
its
elaborate
music
its
pair
of
distinguished
clergymen
in
full
canonicals
but
now
somehow
as
the
words
sounded
upon
her
ears
it
seemed
to
matter
less
under
what
circumstances
they
were
spoken
so
that
the
answers
to
the
solemn
questions
came
from
the
hearts
of
those
who
spoke
them
and
of
this
she
could
have
no
possible
doubt
by
and
by
when
in
her
turn
back
in
the
festally
decorated
house
she
came
to
give
the
newly
married
pair
her
felicitations
she
was
well
pleased
to
see
stuart
quite
himself
again
smiling
at
her
with
the
proud
look
of
the
bridegroom
from
whom
no
human
being
can
wrest
the
prize
he
has
just
secured
and
as
she
noted
jeannette
equally
evident
happy
content
with
the
man
she
had
married
georgiana
took
courage
for
their
future
surely
surely
they
could
go
from
these
scenes
of
luxury
to
the
plainer
life
that
awaited
them
and
miss
nothing
so
that
they
took
with
them
as
they
were
doing
the
one
thing
needful
it
all
right
i
sure
it
all
right
dears
she
said
to
them
and
she
said
it
again
to
her
husband
when
they
were
rushing
back
to
new
york
by
the
first
train
after
the
bridal
pair
had
gone
yes
i
think
it
is
he
agreed
it
an
interesting
experiment
but
not
more
hazardous
than
many
another
in
the
matrimonial
line
if
it
succeeds
jeannette
will
come
out
a
finer
woman
than
she
could
ever
have
been
by
any
other
process
it
amusing
though
to
see
her
family
evidently
they
regard
her
as
one
lost
to
the
world
quite
as
much
as
if
she
had
gone
into
a
convent
to
take
the
vows
perpetual
all
but
uncle
thomas
he
knows
he
understands
little
as
he
says
he
grew
up
on
a
farm
himself
he
told
me
once
that
he
could
never
smother
the
longing
to
get
back
to
one
poor
uncle
thomas
chained
to
a
mahogany
desk
with
a
persian
rug
under
his
feet
that
one
little
trip
across
the
water
when
the
family
went
last
year
was
the
only
vacation
he
had
taken
in
five
years
and
he
came
back
on
the
next
ship
jean
and
stuart
will
have
him
often
with
them
see
if
they
do
i
hope
so
change
is
what
he
needs
very
badly
change
oh
if
everybody
could
have
that
when
they
need
it
how
it
does
make
lives
over
i
know
how
i
do
know
it
the
deadly
monotony
that
kills
jean
will
bloom
under
the
old
farmhouse
roof
away
from
all
the
fuss
and
frivolity
she
so
tired
of
you
done
some
blooming
yourself
observed
her
husband
though
venture
to
say
you
work
harder
than
you
ever
did
before
even
at
the
old
loom
she
gave
him
a
quick
glance
oh
it
was
play
i
needed
just
work
the
sort
of
work
i
love
i
have
that
now
i
love
the
visits
to
the
hospital
the
looking
after
the
patients
you
bring
home
the
taking
notes
of
your
lectures
the
teaching
of
my
evening
class
of
italians
every
bit
of
it
is
a
delight
and
then
when
we
do
run
away
for
a
few
hours
like
this
we
enjoy
it
all
the
more
for
the
contrast
yes
i
think
we
do
it
a
pretty
fine
partnership
and
it
grows
more
satisfying
all
the
time
here
hoping
the
two
we
just
seen
start
follow
in
our
contented
footsteps
a
year
from
now
we
know
chapter
xxix
milestones
georgiana
would
not
have
believed
that
it
would
be
a
full
year
before
she
should
have
a
chance
to
see
for
herself
what
sort
of
life
jeannette
and
stuart
were
making
for
themselves
under
the
conditions
which
seemed
such
doubtful
ones
but
so
it
turned
out
it
had
been
before
jeannette
marriage
that
georgiana
found
a
change
coming
in
her
own
life
and
the
months
of
the
summer
and
autumn
which
followed
were
busy
with
the
happy
preparations
for
the
new
experience
in
january
her
first
son
was
born
and
she
learned
that
even
a
full
and
joyous
partnership
between
two
human
beings
is
not
the
most
complete
thing
that
can
happen
to
them
when
she
saw
her
husband
take
the
round
little
bundle
in
his
arms
for
the
first
time
and
watched
his
face
as
he
explored
the
tiny
features
for
signs
of
the
future
her
heart
beat
high
with
such
rich
content
as
she
had
not
dreamed
of
strange
is
it
dear
craig
said
when
he
had
laid
the
pink
bundle
back
in
the
arms
of
the
nurse
who
bore
it
away
to
the
pretty
nursery
close
at
hand
it
an
old
miracle
always
new
and
never
so
wonderful
as
when
it
comes
to
us
for
the
first
time
how
that
little
life
can
be
neither
you
nor
i
yet
both
of
us
in
one
big
possibilities
are
wrapped
up
in
that
bit
of
flesh
and
blood
it
going
to
be
a
great
interest
the
watching
them
begin
to
show
oh
yes
she
murmured
lying
quietly
with
her
hand
beneath
her
cheek
too
weary
and
too
happy
for
speech
i
wonder
if
i
dare
to
tell
you
how
soon
it
was
after
i
knew
you
that
i
began
to
think
of
you
as
playing
this
part
in
my
life
he
said
very
softly
did
you
i
so
glad
it
was
hardly
more
than
a
whisper
are
you
glad
i
often
think
a
girl
little
dreams
of
how
often
that
vision
comes
to
a
man
long
before
she
has
thought
of
it
at
all
i
was
only
a
very
young
man
when
i
began
to
think
of
it
even
when
there
was
no
woman
in
my
mind
i
used
to
plan
what
i
would
do
for
my
own
son
when
i
should
have
him
and
when
i
saw
you
i
thought
with
the
greatest
reverence
darling
might
be
my
son
mother
he
did
not
need
the
look
her
eyes
gave
him
to
tell
him
how
this
touched
her
when
he
went
quietly
away
to
leave
her
for
the
long
sleep
she
needed
it
was
with
the
consciousness
that
the
bond
between
them
was
more
absolute
than
it
had
ever
been
it
was
in
the
following
june
on
the
anniversary
of
the
marriage
of
the
james
mckenzie
stuarts
that
the
jefferson
craigs
had
their
first
opportunity
to
see
with
their
own
eyes
how
that
marriage
was
prospering
letters
from
jeannette
had
come
to
georgiana
from
time
to
time
with
an
occasional
postscript
from
stuart
and
these
letters
always
breathed
of
happiness
but
one
ca
be
perfectly
sure
from
letters
georgiana
argued
after
all
the
opposition
and
skepticism
they
would
never
own
to
anybody
that
life
did
flow
like
a
stream
but
one
glimpse
of
their
faces
will
tell
the
story
if
jeannette
has
a
certain
look
i
often
seen
on
the
faces
of
girls
who
have
been
married
about
a
year
i
shall
guess
what
causes
it
as
for
jimps
he
will
be
as
easily
read
as
an
open
book
jeff
you
wo
let
anything
prevent
our
being
there
for
the
fête
they
ask
us
for
nothing
that
i
can
foresee
and
provide
for
craig
promised
i
quite
as
eager
as
you
to
discover
how
the
transplanting
of
the
hothouse
plant
into
the
hardy
outdoor
soil
of
the
country
has
worked
out
there
are
two
results
about
equally
probable
in
such
cases
hardly
equally
probable
either
the
natural
result
i
should
fear
would
be
the
dwindling
and
stunting
of
the
growth
unless
protected
by
expedients
not
common
to
the
country
and
fertilized
until
it
should
be
really
not
growing
in
country
soil
at
all
but
the
possible
result
urged
georgiana
the
one
we
hoping
for
in
this
case
though
i
not
sure
how
close
an
analogy
i
can
draw
being
no
gardener
is
the
gradual
process
of
adaptation
to
environment
so
that
the
plant
takes
on
a
hardier
quality
at
an
unavoidable
sacrifice
in
size
of
bloom
but
with
a
corresponding
gain
in
sturdiness
and
ability
to
bear
the
chilling
winds
and
the
beating
sunlight
of
outdoors
great
size
in
a
flower
never
appealed
to
me
anyhow
i
like
a
blossom
that
stands
straight
and
firm
upon
its
stem
that
gives
forth
a
clean
spicy
fragrance
and
does
wilt
when
it
has
been
an
hour
in
my
buttonhole
that
the
sort
jimps
wants
i
sure
he
used
to
be
always
tucking
one
of
his
scarlet
geranium
blossoms
into
his
coat
when
he
came
over
to
see
me
we
all
think
of
jeannette
as
the
frailest
sort
of
an
orchid
beautiful
to
look
at
but
ready
to
wither
at
a
touch
this
letter
of
invitation
does
sound
like
that
at
all
you
really
think
the
long
drive
wo
hurt
little
son
not
a
bit
if
you
keep
from
getting
tired
or
overheated
yourself
we
can
manage
that
very
nicely
with
duncan
to
drive
lydia
to
look
after
the
boy
and
a
long
stop
on
the
one
night
we
must
spend
on
the
way
the
change
will
do
you
good
faithful
young
mother
this
proved
quite
true
and
the
two
days
journey
in
the
great
car
was
indeed
an
easy
one
for
all
concerned
little
jefferson
junior
six
months
old
slept
away
many
hours
of
the
trip
and
spent
the
rest
happily
in
his
nurse
or
his
mother
lap
watching
with
big
dark
eyes
the
spots
of
colour
or
life
on
the
summer
landscape
as
it
slipped
smoothly
past
georgiana
had
wanted
to
bring
father
davy
but
though
he
had
grown
considerably
stronger
during
the
past
year
it
had
not
seemed
worth
while
to
put
his
endurance
to
so
severe
a
test
he
had
not
been
left
forlorn
however
for
the
peter
brandts
had
taken
him
to
their
home
a
welcome
and
a
delighted
guest
no
doubt
but
there
was
a
place
for
david
warne
in
the
great
city
as
there
had
been
in
the
country
village
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
as
they
neared
the
old
home
village
to
which
georgiana
had
returned
only
once
since
her
marriage
she
found
herself
noting
with
quickening
pulse
every
familiar
landmark
it
seems
so
strange
to
think
of
my
going
away
from
such
scenes
for
good
and
all
and
jean
coming
to
them
she
said
to
herself
more
than
once
how
little
either
of
us
would
have
believed
it
just
two
short
years
ago
when
they
passed
the
old
manse
she
gazed
at
it
with
affectionate
eyes
oh
how
shabby
and
poor
it
looks
she
said
under
her
breath
to
craig
did
it
look
like
that
when
you
first
saw
it
he
nodded
smiling
just
like
that
but
the
moment
the
door
opened
the
first
time
i
knew
its
shabbiness
was
just
a
blind
to
mislead
the
traveler
who
might
otherwise
stop
and
try
to
steal
the
treasure
that
it
held
her
eyes
were
searching
next
for
the
chimney
tops
that
should
mark
the
other
home
for
which
they
were
bound
how
often
had
she
looked
at
those
chimney
tops
because
they
told
her
where
was
her
best
friend
during
those
solitary
days
that
were
already
so
far
past
a
moment
more
and
georgiana
first
exclamation
of
surprise
broke
from
her
lips
there
were
to
be
many
before
the
day
was
done
look
all
those
ugly
little
buildings
at
the
back
are
gone
and
the
house
stands
all
by
itself
at
the
top
of
the
slope
is
that
an
improvement
it
freshly
painted
too
how
that
clear
white
brings
out
the
beauty
of
the
old
house
it
used
to
be
such
a
dingy
slate
i
always
knew
it
was
a
pleasant
place
but
i
did
fully
appreciate
it
the
lawn
is
as
trim
as
can
be
and
there
a
border
of
shrubs
and
flowers
all
along
the
drive
how
little
real
change
to
make
so
much
that
jean
i
know
oh
and
there
jean
herself
running
down
the
steps
she
sees
us
is
that
really
jeannette
crofton
craig
doubted
yes
for
a
fact
well
well
they
might
easily
doubt
the
evidence
of
their
eyes
for
the
slim
figure
they
had
known
so
well
had
rounded
until
it
showed
softly
blooming
curves
and
colouring
which
put
to
blush
the
cosmetics
which
the
society
girl
had
not
altogether
eschewed
though
it
had
been
long
before
the
less
sophisticated
cousin
had
found
this
out
no
need
for
rouge
or
powder
now
for
nature
had
laid
on
the
lovely
face
her
own
unrivalled
tints
of
rose
overlying
the
soft
browns
of
summer
tan
oh
you
darlings
to
come
and
bring
the
baby
do
let
me
look
at
him
the
blessed
thing
is
he
a
beauty
but
of
course
how
could
he
help
it
jimps
o
jimps
here
they
are
thus
cried
jeannette
out
of
sheer
exuberance
though
the
fact
of
the
arrival
was
obvious
enough
and
james
stuart
was
already
dashing
across
the
lawn
from
the
opposite
direction
as
she
looked
at
her
cousin
georgiana
first
impression
was
the
one
she
had
hardly
dared
hope
for
that
of
jeannette
entire
content
and
not
only
was
the
physical
improvement
noteworthy
but
a
certain
worn
and
worldly
look
had
vanished
one
which
had
not
affected
her
beauty
and
had
been
discernible
only
to
the
closely
observing
eye
but
which
had
been
there
none
the
less
and
was
gone
now
this
change
grew
more
and
more
apparent
as
georgiana
continued
to
regard
her
young
hostess
from
the
moment
the
party
first
entered
the
front
door
it
was
easy
to
discover
that
both
stuart
and
his
wife
were
eager
as
two
children
for
the
approval
of
their
guests
such
approval
was
not
long
in
appearing
how
pleasant
how
charming
cried
georgiana
as
her
quick
eye
took
in
attractive
effect
after
effect
oh
you
clever
things
to
do
it
like
this
how
absolutely
in
keeping
it
all
is
and
how
quiet
yet
how
beautiful
she
done
it
vowed
james
stuart
proudly
i
was
a
duffer
at
it
till
she
showed
me
what
she
was
after
i
wanted
to
buy
brocaded
silk
furniture
like
that
in
her
home
while
my
money
held
out
but
she
would
have
nothing
but
this
sort
of
thing
homelike
is
it
it
was
the
word
which
described
it
if
one
qualified
the
term
by
making
it
apply
only
to
homes
built
on
foundations
of
good
taste
and
suitability
to
environment
as
she
looked
about
her
georgiana
saw
everywhere
evidences
of
the
use
of
abundant
means
and
she
realized
that
jeannette
had
been
clever
indeed
to
supply
so
much
without
impressing
stuart
with
the
undoubted
fact
that
she
had
contributed
more
than
he
to
the
final
result
the
whole
effect
of
the
house
interior
was
one
of
but
unostentatious
comfort
and
the
materials
and
furnishings
used
were
all
so
nicely
adapted
to
their
setting
that
only
to
more
discerning
eyes
than
those
of
the
stuarts
neighbours
would
they
have
expressed
unusual
resources
of
supply
it
an
achievement
craig
declared
his
enlightened
gaze
traveled
from
one
point
to
another
of
the
long
sunny
with
new
windows
and
with
walls
and
hangings
of
soft
browns
and
golden
yellows
he
noted
that
jeannette
had
had
the
good
sense
to
make
use
of
the
old
furniture
the
house
possessed
wherever
it
was
fit
for
preservation
and
that
she
had
dignified
the
walls
by
retaining
certain
dim
old
portraits
done
in
fading
oils
of
stuart
ancestors
everywhere
could
be
seen
similar
interesting
blending
of
the
new
and
the
old
though
it
was
often
difficult
to
tell
which
was
which
the
elder
stuarts
were
living
in
a
wing
of
the
house
that
being
the
portion
where
they
had
spent
their
lives
making
little
use
of
the
upright
and
the
corresponding
wing
which
were
now
turned
over
to
the
son
and
his
wife
since
the
elder
people
wisely
preferred
this
the
younger
were
able
to
be
much
by
themselves
stuart
explained
though
always
near
and
ready
to
lend
a
hand
at
any
hour
since
the
stalwart
son
could
not
be
entirely
spared
by
the
somewhat
feeble
old
couple
the
arrangement
seemed
an
admirable
one
and
thus
far
it
had
worked
very
well
jean
such
a
dear
with
them
stuart
said
covertly
to
georgiana
leading
her
aside
for
a
moment
to
look
at
a
curious
old
buffet
which
had
been
long
in
the
family
they
adore
her
and
she
really
seems
very
fond
of
them
of
course
they
have
old
eliza
to
look
after
them
as
they
have
had
for
so
long
but
we
ask
them
in
to
dinner
every
few
days
and
often
have
them
sitting
by
the
fire
with
us
here
on
cool
evenings
the
funny
part
though
is
when
mother
crofton
comes
she
ca
get
over
it
or
get
used
to
it
she
sits
and
looks
at
jean
as
if
she
were
an
actress
in
a
play
and
by
and
by
would
take
off
her
and
be
herself
again
i
wonder
how
far
that
is
from
the
real
truth
thought
georgiana
to
herself
as
she
watched
the
young
mistress
of
the
place
with
fascinated
eyes
certainly
if
jeannette
were
acting
it
was
very
skilfully
done
as
she
led
her
guests
about
the
house
and
then
established
them
on
the
lawn
beneath
the
great
elms
which
furnished
a
grateful
shade
at
this
afternoon
hour
over
nearly
the
whole
expanse
she
seemed
the
embodiment
of
health
and
happiness
by
and
by
when
the
crofton
car
arrived
bearing
uncle
thomas
and
aunt
olivia
with
rosalie
and
chester
following
a
few
moments
later
in
chester
roadster
jeannette
grew
fairly
radiant

questions
and
answers
it
was
not
until
late
that
evening
that
georgiana
had
a
chance
really
to
learn
the
whole
state
of
the
case
during
the
intervening
hours
had
occurred
the
event
for
which
they
had
all
been
invited
the
entertaining
of
at
least
two
hundred
people
from
the
surrounding
country
and
the
village
for
this
event
which
stuart
naïvely
called
a
party
jeannette
a
lawn
fête
and
the
guests
themselves
for
the
most
part
a
picnic
porches
lawn
and
trees
had
been
hung
with
gay
lanterns
bonfires
had
been
built
the
small
village
band
engaged
a
light
but
delectable
supper
provided
and
as
much
jollity
planned
as
could
be
crowded
into
the
hours
between
five
and
eleven
from
the
standpoint
of
those
entertaining
at
least
the
affair
had
been
a
success
for
stuart
long
accustomed
to
the
ways
of
his
fellow
countrymen
considered
himself
fully
able
to
tell
from
their
manner
if
not
from
their
expressions
of
pleasure
whether
they
had
really
found
enjoyment
in
the
efforts
of
their
hosts
they
had
a
mighty
good
time
no
doubt
about
it
he
declared
when
the
last
reluctant
guest
had
departed
in
the
last
small
car
which
had
waited
at
the
edge
of
the
roadway
not
the
least
of
young
chester
enjoyment
had
been
occasioned
by
the
sight
of
the
long
row
of
vehicles
from
wagons
to
smart
and
even
expensive
motors
which
had
lined
the
road
for
many
rods
and
a
lot
of
them
are
well
worth
knowing
stuart
added
his
eye
chanced
to
fall
on
his
thomas
crofton
as
he
made
this
assertion
the
party
were
sitting
in
a
group
upon
the
porch
and
its
steps
and
the
senior
crofton
face
was
plainly
visible
that
gentleman
nodded
you
quite
right
jim
he
said
i
do
know
when
i
had
a
more
interesting
conversation
with
any
man
than
i
did
with
one
of
your
neighbours
nor
found
a
more
intelligent
set
of
opinions
on
every
subject
we
touched
on
he
was
the
only
one
either
as
a
rule
i
found
the
people
who
came
here
possessed
of
rather
more
than
the
average
amount
of
brains
i
should
like
to
try
living
among
them
for
a
change
at
least
i
struck
a
dolt
or
two
remarked
his
son
chester
but
dolts
are
uncommon
anywhere
even
when
not
and
i
did
run
up
against
some
chaps
i
liked
jolly
well
one
of
them
invited
me
up
for
a
i
nearly
fell
over
when
he
did
it
i
did
know
country
people
ever
talked
about
i
thought
they
called
it
over
sunday
you
mean
wells
lawson
stuart
informed
him
if
you
could
see
the
list
of
newspapers
and
magazines
not
to
mention
books
that
the
lawsons
take
you
open
your
eyes
he
and
his
family
have
traveled
a
lot
more
than
i
have
and
their
home
is
one
of
the
finest
model
farms
in
the
county
there
no
hayseed
in
their
hair
i
did
discover
much
hayseed
in
anybody
hair
observed
jefferson
craig
i
think
it
gone
out
of
fashion
there
were
some
of
the
prettiest
girls
here
i
ever
saw
was
rosalie
contribution
to
the
list
of
comments
a
figure
of
exquisite
modishness
she
perched
upon
the
porch
rail
near
chester
i
did
want
to
tell
them
not
to
let
any
one
young
man
stick
by
them
every
minute
the
way
they
did
but
i
could
hardly
blame
the
young
men
for
wanting
to
stick
the
girls
were
so
sweet
and
some
of
them
were
quite
stunning
you
certainly
gave
them
an
example
of
how
to
make
eyes
at
fifteen
or
twenty
fellows
one
after
another
laughed
her
brother
at
her
side
you
have
had
them
all
coming
rosy
if
they
had
been
tied
up
to
their
respective
girls
a
lesson
or
two
from
you
and
those
girls
would
begin
to
play
in
proper
shape
rosy
going
to
stay
and
take
a
few
lessons
herself
insinuated
jeannette
who
sat
with
her
shapely
young
arm
resting
upon
her
knee
as
she
occupied
the
step
below
him
i
promise
to
put
some
flesh
on
her
little
bones
if
she
here
a
month
she
too
thin
after
only
her
second
season
oh
i
stay
promised
rosalie
promptly
i
simply
love
it
here
crazy
to
stay
it
all
very
well
now
came
aunt
olivia
low
murmur
in
ear
there
had
been
many
of
such
murmurs
in
the
same
ear
during
the
afternoon
and
evening
though
why
georgiana
herself
could
not
guess
since
the
elder
woman
knew
the
younger
to
be
unreservedly
committed
to
upholding
jeannette
whole
course
very
well
now
in
june
with
flowers
blooming
and
friends
about
but
how
the
poor
child
is
going
to
face
a
second
winter
i
ca
imagine
she
faced
the
first
one
very
happily
georgiana
reminded
her
the
first
one
was
a
novelty
and
of
course
she
was
determined
not
to
acknowledge
how
lonely
she
must
often
have
been
i
do
not
say
that
james
stuart
is
not
a
very
attractive
and
trustworthy
young
man
i
am
fond
of
him
myself
very
but
i
shall
always
feel
that
jeannette
has
made
a
terrible
mistake
brought
up
as
she
has
been
it
is
not
conceivable
that
she
should
continue
to
find
this
sort
of
life
possible
it
was
with
this
moan
in
her
ears
that
a
few
minutes
later
georgiana
listened
to
james
stuart
he
had
drawn
her
away
from
the
group
and
was
strolling
with
her
across
the
lawn
well
george
tell
me
your
honest
opinion
is
my
wife
happy
it
was
a
blunt
question
but
georgiana
understood
he
asked
it
not
to
be
reassured
but
because
he
was
confident
of
the
answer
she
spoke
guardedly
i
never
saw
her
seem
more
so
jimps
you
are
sure
of
it
yourself
i
want
you
to
ask
her
will
you
it
not
the
sort
of
question
to
ask
anybody
is
it
it
is
in
this
case
do
you
think
i
do
know
the
doubt
in
all
your
minds
yes
even
yours
for
you
become
another
person
since
you
married
craig
oh
no
oh
yes
you
been
thinking
ever
since
you
came
that
you
dead
thankful
you
do
have
to
come
back
to
it
now
have
you
jimps
dear
i
lived
all
my
life
in
the
hardest
narrowest
economy
if
i
had
had
all
this
beautiful
experience
jean
is
having
i
know
but
you
would
come
back
even
to
this
place
of
ours
that
begging
the
question
for
jean
it
a
wonderful
change
and
any
one
can
see
what
it
done
for
her
physically
yes
but
i
want
you
to
find
out
whether
she
actually
happy
or
not
i
will
promised
his
friend
with
a
nod
for
she
knew
james
stuart
much
too
well
to
imagine
she
could
put
him
off
without
complying
with
his
expressed
desire
it
looked
as
if
jeannette
herself
were
anxious
to
assure
her
mind
for
stuart
had
no
sooner
brought
georgiana
back
to
the
porch
than
his
wife
took
possession
of
her
georgiana
dear
i
want
you
to
tell
me
one
thing
began
jeannette
as
the
two
moved
slowly
a
little
away
from
the
rest
do
you
think
we
are
making
a
success
of
it
a
wonderful
success
jean
i
could
have
believed
it
even
what
i
see
on
the
surface
how
about
it
inside
that
a
pretty
searching
question
and
you
need
answer
it
if
you
do
want
to
everything
about
you
seems
to
answer
it
jeannette
stopped
short
and
turned
to
face
her
cousin
have
i
written
you
the
answer
over
and
over
yes
that
why
i
want
to
hear
it
from
your
own
lips
you
shall
first
though
georgiana
you
knew
antoinette
burwell
married
miles
channing
last
december
i
heard
of
it
how
do
they
come
on
separated
she
gone
back
to
her
father
she
was
the
most
wildly
happy
bride
i
ever
saw
think
of
it
george
in
six
months
what
do
you
suppose
would
have
happened
if
you
do
i
did
and
georgiana
grateful
thoughts
went
back
to
one
of
the
crises
in
her
life
the
one
from
which
jefferson
craig
had
rescued
her
do
you
know
the
ralph
hendersons
married
two
years
now
i
sure
you
heard
me
speak
of
them
everybody
knows
they
quarrel
like
cats
and
dogs
they
hardly
civil
to
each
other
in
public
and
i
know
several
more
of
our
old
set
who
are
none
too
happy
if
one
may
judge
by
their
looks
yet
they
all
married
their
own
class
as
mother
is
so
fond
of
saying
as
if
i
did
i
married
it
and
i
am
supposed
to
have
cast
away
all
my
chances
for
this
life
not
to
mention
the
next
by
marrying
my
farmer
georgiana
i
getting
to
hate
that
word
why
is
there
a
new
word
made
for
the
man
who
reads
and
studies
and
uses
the
latest
modern
methods
on
his
farm
there
are
such
a
lot
of
them
now
college
graduates
like
jimps
and
men
who
have
taken
agricultural
courses
and
are
putting
their
brains
into
their
work
why
is
there
a
new
word
the
old
word
must
be
made
to
acquire
a
new
dignity
georgiana
suggested
never
mind
the
word
you
glad
you
married
your
farmer
glad
i
thank
god
every
night
and
morning
i
thank
him
every
time
i
go
running
down
the
lane
to
meet
my
husband
coming
up
from
the
meadow
of
course
i
know
georgiana
that
the
life
i
living
is
the
typical
life
of
the
farmer
wife
at
all
thanks
to
jimps
success
and
my
own
little
but
it
has
all
outdoors
in
it
and
lots
of
lovely
indoors
and
i
growing
so
well
and
strong
you
can
see
that
by
just
looking
at
me
and
i
getting
to
know
my
neighbours
and
like
them
some
of
them
oh
so
much
life
never
was
so
full
mother
talks
about
how
hard
i
find
it
to
get
through
my
second
winter
it
worry
me
we
order
books
and
books
and
we
go
for
splendid
tramps
and
every
now
and
then
we
run
into
town
for
concerts
and
plays
and
best
of
all
georgiana
her
voice
sank
i
sure
sure
jimps
disappointed
in
me
disappointed
i
should
say
not
the
lucky
boy
georgiana
agreed
all
her
fears
gone
to
the
winds
when
they
returned
to
the
porch
it
was
to
hear
an
outcry
from
jeannette
mother
chester
crofton
have
you
gone
absolutely
crazy
i
think
so
mother
positively
dippy
got
it
in
its
worst
form
been
coming
on
me
for
some
time
but
it
taken
me
now
for
better
or
for
worse
i
going
to
buy
that
small
farm
across
the
road
and
try
what
i
can
do
i
back
you
came
in
thomas
crofton
deepest
chest
tones
hear
hear
jefferson
craig
shout
drowned
out
groan
o
ches
i
come
and
keep
house
for
you
part
of
the
year
anyhow
this
was
dainty
rosalie
her
ankles
swinging
wildly
as
she
sat
upon
the
porch
rail
georgiana
was
laughing
as
her
eyes
met
her
husband
in
a
glance
of
understanding
but
her
heart
was
very
warm
behind
the
laughter
beyond
the
gleam
of
the
lanterns
she
caught
the
golden
glow
of
a
summer
moon
rising
to
illumine
the
depths
of
the
country
sky
the
immense
arch
of
the
heavens
beneath
lay
many
homes
big
and
little
all
filled
with
human
lives
each
with
its
chance
somehow
to
grow
each
with
its
chance
small
or
great
as
a
beloved
writer
has
said
inspiringly
love
and
to
work
and
to
play
and
to
look
up
at
the
the
end
