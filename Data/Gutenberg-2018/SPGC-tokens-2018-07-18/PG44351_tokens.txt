bob
houston
youthful
clerk
in
the
archives
division
of
the
war
department
drew
his
topcoat
closer
about
him
and
shivered
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
shelter
of
the
apartment
house
entrance
and
faced
the
chill
fall
rain
going
back
to
the
office
after
a
full
day
bent
over
a
desk
was
no
fun
but
a
job
was
a
job
and
bob
was
thankful
for
even
the
small
place
he
filled
in
the
great
machine
of
government
the
raw
beating
rain
swept
into
his
face
as
he
strode
down
the
avenue
a
cruising
taxicab
hoping
for
a
passenger
pulled
along
the
curb
but
bob
waved
the
vehicle
away
just
then
he
had
no
extra
funds
to
invest
in
taxi
fare
the
avenue
was
deserted
and
bob
doubted
if
there
would
be
many
at
work
in
the
huge
building
where
the
archives
division
was
sheltered
at
the
end
of
a
walk
bob
turned
in
at
the
entrance
of
a
hulking
gray
structure
the
night
guard
nodded
as
he
recognized
bob
and
the
clerk
stepped
through
the
doorway
bob
paused
in
the
warmth
of
the
lobby
and
shook
the
water
from
his
coat
and
hat
fortunately
he
had
worn
rubbers
so
his
feet
were
dry
and
he
felt
there
was
little
chance
of
his
catching
cold
the
door
behind
him
opened
and
a
blast
of
raw
air
swirled
into
the
lobby
bob
turned
quickly
then
hurried
to
greet
the
newcomer
hello
uncle
merritt
he
cried
i
didn
t
expect
to
run
into
you
down
here
merritt
hughes
one
of
the
crack
agents
of
the
department
of
justice
smiled
as
he
shook
the
rain
from
his
hat
i
was
driving
home
when
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
you
coming
in
here
working
tonight
i
ve
got
at
least
two
hours
of
work
ahead
of
me
replied
bob
anyone
else
going
to
be
with
you
inquired
his
uncle
no
i
m
good
i
want
to
talk
with
you
where
there
is
no
chance
that
we
may
be
bob
was
tempted
to
ask
what
it
was
all
about
but
he
knew
that
in
good
time
his
uncle
would
tell
him
they
stepped
into
an
automatic
elevator
and
bob
pressed
the
control
button
there
was
a
distinct
resemblance
between
uncle
and
nephew
merritt
hughes
looked
as
though
he
might
be
bob
s
older
brother
he
was
well
built
about
five
feet
eight
inches
tall
and
usually
tipped
the
scales
at
pounds
but
there
was
no
fat
on
his
well
conditioned
body
his
hair
was
a
dull
brown
but
the
keenness
of
his
eyes
made
up
for
whatever
coloring
was
lacking
in
his
hair
bob
was
taller
than
his
uncle
and
would
outweigh
him
ten
pounds
his
hair
was
light
and
his
pleasant
blue
eyes
were
alert
to
everything
that
was
going
on
both
had
rather
large
and
definite
noses
and
bob
often
chided
his
uncle
on
that
family
trait
the
elevator
stopped
at
the
top
floor
and
they
stepped
out
another
guard
stopped
them
and
bob
was
forced
to
present
his
identification
card
the
small
golden
badge
which
his
uncle
displayed
was
sufficient
to
gain
his
admittance
bob
s
desk
was
in
one
wing
of
the
archives
division
and
they
made
their
way
there
without
loss
of
time
bob
took
his
uncle
s
topcoat
and
hung
it
beside
his
own
when
he
turned
back
to
his
desk
his
uncle
was
seated
on
the
other
side
leaning
back
comfortably
in
a
swivel
chair
still
have
the
idea
you
d
like
to
join
the
bureau
of
investigation
of
the
department
of
justice
asked
merritt
hughes
the
question
was
casual
almost
offhand
and
bob
wasn
t
sure
that
he
had
heard
correctly
you
re
kidding
me
now
he
grinned
you
know
i
d
like
to
get
in
the
service
but
i
haven
t
a
chance
why
i
m
not
through
with
my
college
work
and
they
re
only
taking
graduates
i
m
not
kidding
bob
i
m
serious
i
think
there
may
be
a
chance
for
you
to
get
in
of
course
you
d
have
to
finish
your
college
work
after
you
were
in
the
department
but
that
wouldn
t
be
too
much
of
a
i
ll
say
it
wouldn
t
exulted
bob
now
tell
me
what
it
s
all
about
the
last
time
i
talked
to
you
about
getting
in
you
gave
me
about
as
much
encouragement
as
though
i
was
suggesting
a
swim
across
the
atlantic
merritt
hughes
was
a
long
time
in
answering
and
when
he
finally
spoke
his
voice
was
so
low
that
anyone
ten
feet
away
would
have
been
unable
to
hear
his
words
there
s
trouble
and
big
trouble
brewing
right
in
this
department
he
said
we
don
t
know
just
exactly
what
is
going
to
happen
but
we
must
be
prepared
for
any
bob
started
to
speak
but
his
uncle
waved
the
words
aside
and
went
on
we
could
plant
an
agent
here
but
that
might
be
too
obvious
what
we
need
is
someone
on
the
inside
whom
we
can
trust
bob
teetering
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
breathlessly
waited
for
the
next
words
i
m
counting
on
you
to
be
the
key
in
the
intrigue
that
s
going
on
right
now
in
this
building
said
merritt
hughes
what
about
it
you
know
you
can
rely
on
me
said
bob
why
i
d
do
almost
anything
take
almost
any
risk
to
get
into
the
bureau
of
investigation
of
the
department
of
i
know
you
would
bob
but
that
isn
t
going
to
be
necessary
all
i
want
is
someone
who
will
keep
his
eyes
open
listen
to
everything
that
is
said
around
here
and
report
to
me
each
night
in
detail
you
know
i
wouldn
t
want
you
butting
into
something
where
you
might
get
but
i
m
young
and
husky
i
can
take
care
of
myself
protested
bob
his
eyes
reflecting
his
eagerness
sure
i
know
you
can
but
after
all
i
ve
got
to
look
out
for
you
your
mother
would
never
forgive
me
if
any
actual
harm
came
to
you
while
you
were
doing
a
little
sleuthing
for
there
was
a
tender
note
in
the
voice
of
the
agent
for
it
had
devolved
upon
him
to
watch
over
bob
and
his
mother
after
the
death
of
his
sister
s
husband
some
six
years
before
he
had
been
faithful
to
the
trust
and
he
had
no
intention
now
of
placing
bob
in
any
situation
where
there
would
be
real
jeopardy
to
his
life
go
on
go
on
urged
bob
tell
me
what
i
m
to
watch
for
and
what
you
instead
of
answering
merritt
hughes
stepped
to
the
door
opened
it
made
a
careful
survey
of
the
hall
and
then
drew
his
chair
closer
to
bob
chapter
ii
an
empty
room
what
do
you
know
about
the
new
radio
developments
which
have
been
made
recently
by
the
war
department
he
asked
bob
s
surprise
was
reflected
in
the
look
which
flashed
across
his
face
there
had
been
only
the
vaguest
of
rumors
that
startling
radio
advancements
had
been
made
by
war
department
engineers
it
had
been
only
thin
talk
in
the
department
the
clerks
mentioning
it
on
several
occasions
when
they
had
been
alone
i
ve
heard
some
talk
that
rather
surprising
advancements
have
been
made
said
bob
but
there
has
been
nothing
definite
known
of
course
some
of
the
clerks
have
been
talking
about
but
no
one
has
any
definite
information
as
far
as
you
know
the
plans
have
not
been
filed
in
the
vaults
merritt
hughes
was
pressing
hard
for
an
answer
but
bob
could
only
shake
his
head
this
division
handles
most
of
the
radio
data
he
said
but
nothing
new
has
been
placed
in
the
vaults
here
for
weeks
i
m
simply
cleaning
up
routine
if
new
plans
and
data
were
filed
you
might
handle
them
persisted
his
uncle
that
s
quite
likely
but
i
wouldn
t
know
the
contents
everything
comes
in
under
seal
and
with
a
key
number
and
only
the
engineers
know
the
key
and
the
contents
of
the
sealed
still
you
might
have
a
hunch
when
the
papers
are
important
i
might
there
is
always
talk
in
the
department
but
i
would
have
no
way
of
actually
knowing
what
was
going
through
my
i
was
afraid
of
that
admitted
his
uncle
it
makes
things
all
the
harder
if
you
only
knew
when
the
plans
were
going
through
you
would
be
in
a
position
to
use
every
but
i
don
t
take
any
chances
now
retorted
bob
extreme
care
is
used
with
every
single
batch
of
plans
that
are
sent
over
by
the
oh
i
didn
t
mean
that
you
were
careless
bob
smiled
the
department
of
justice
agent
i
only
meant
that
if
you
knew
when
radio
secrets
were
going
through
you
could
use
additional
care
and
set
up
extra
you
must
be
afraid
something
is
going
to
be
that
s
exactly
what
is
troubling
me
confessed
his
uncle
and
i
m
afraid
that
unknowingly
you
may
be
involved
i
don
t
want
you
to
get
caught
in
a
trap
if
i
can
help
it
that
s
why
i
stopped
here
tonight
i
wanted
to
have
this
talk
with
you
to
warn
you
that
there
have
been
important
discoveries
by
the
engineers
and
that
they
may
be
through
in
a
few
days
from
now
on
watch
every
single
document
that
is
sent
through
your
hands
don
t
let
it
out
of
your
sight
from
the
moment
it
is
delivered
to
you
until
you
have
filed
it
and
placed
it
properly
in
the
vaults
understand
bob
his
face
grave
nodded
i
ll
see
that
nothing
like
that
happens
but
who
could
be
after
these
new
plans
merritt
hughes
shrugged
his
shoulders
bob
if
i
could
answer
that
question
this
problem
would
be
comparatively
simple
the
answer
may
be
right
here
in
this
department
again
it
may
be
some
outside
force
that
we
can
only
guess
are
you
working
alone
on
this
case
bob
continued
a
shadow
of
a
frown
passed
over
merritt
hughes
face
i
wish
i
were
i
d
feel
more
sure
of
my
that
means
condon
adams
is
also
on
the
job
put
in
bob
for
he
knew
of
the
sharp
feeling
between
his
uncle
and
adams
another
ace
operative
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
they
had
been
together
on
several
cases
and
at
every
opportunity
adams
had
tried
to
obtain
all
of
the
credit
for
the
successful
outcome
of
their
efforts
he
was
both
unpleasant
and
ruthless
but
he
had
a
faculty
of
getting
results
and
bob
knew
that
for
this
reason
alone
he
was
able
to
retain
his
position
the
fact
that
condon
adams
was
on
the
case
placed
a
different
light
on
it
for
bob
for
adams
had
a
nephew
tully
ross
who
was
in
the
archives
division
of
the
department
with
bob
there
was
nothing
in
common
between
the
two
young
men
tully
was
short
of
stature
with
a
thick
chest
and
short
powerful
arms
his
eyebrows
were
dark
and
heavy
set
close
above
his
rather
small
eyes
and
his
whole
face
reflected
an
innate
cruelty
that
bob
knew
must
exist
if
condon
adams
was
also
on
the
case
it
meant
that
tully
ross
would
be
doing
his
best
to
help
his
uncle
for
like
bob
tully
was
intent
upon
getting
into
the
bureau
of
investigation
bob
s
lips
snapped
into
a
thin
firm
line
all
right
if
that
was
the
way
it
was
to
be
he
d
see
that
tully
had
a
good
fight
merritt
hughes
smiled
a
little
grimly
thinking
about
tully
ross
he
asked
bob
nodded
then
you
know
what
we
re
up
against
it
s
two
against
two
and
if
you
and
i
win
i
m
sure
that
i
can
get
you
into
the
bureau
if
we
don
t
then
tully
may
go
up
what
do
you
say
i
say
that
we
re
going
to
win
replied
bob
and
there
was
stern
determination
in
his
words
that
s
the
way
to
feel
keep
up
that
kind
of
spirit
and
you
ll
get
in
the
bureau
before
you
know
it
in
the
meantime
don
t
let
any
tricks
get
away
from
you
in
this
routine
watch
every
document
that
comes
into
your
hands
and
let
me
know
at
the
slightest
unusual
happening
in
this
i
ll
even
put
eyes
in
the
back
of
my
head
grinned
bob
as
his
uncle
stood
up
and
donned
his
topcoat
how
long
will
you
work
tonight
asked
merritt
hughes
as
he
opened
the
door
which
gave
access
to
the
hallway
probably
two
hours
maybe
even
watch
yourself
then
he
was
gone
and
bob
was
alone
in
the
room
where
the
rays
from
the
light
on
his
desk
failed
to
penetrate
into
the
deep
shadows
and
a
strange
feeling
of
premonition
crept
over
him
for
a
moment
he
felt
that
someone
was
watching
him
and
to
dispel
this
feeling
he
turned
on
the
glaring
top
lights
the
room
was
empty
chapter
iii
bob
has
a
visitor
bob
turned
off
the
top
lights
and
returned
to
his
desk
which
was
one
of
half
a
dozen
in
the
long
and
rather
narrow
room
at
one
corner
of
the
building
as
he
sat
down
he
could
hear
the
beat
of
the
rain
against
the
window
and
looking
out
could
see
through
the
curtain
of
water
the
dimmed
lights
of
the
sprawling
city
on
a
clear
night
the
view
was
but
on
this
night
his
only
thought
was
to
complete
his
work
and
to
return
to
the
warmth
and
comfort
of
his
own
room
bob
delved
into
the
pile
of
papers
which
had
accumulated
in
the
wire
basket
on
his
desk
they
must
be
filed
and
the
proper
notations
made
there
was
nothing
of
especial
importance
or
he
would
not
have
been
working
alone
for
it
was
a
rule
of
the
division
that
when
documents
of
great
importance
were
to
be
filed
at
least
two
clerks
and
usually
the
chief
of
the
division
must
be
on
hand
sometimes
even
armed
guards
came
in
while
the
filing
was
taking
place
for
some
of
the
secrets
in
the
great
vaults
across
the
corridor
were
worth
millions
to
unscrupulous
men
and
to
other
powers
but
until
tonight
until
his
uncle
s
words
had
aroused
him
bob
had
felt
his
own
work
was
rather
commonplace
there
was
nothing
in
his
life
which
compared
with
the
excitement
and
the
almost
daily
daring
of
the
men
in
the
bureau
of
investigation
of
the
department
of
justice
the
hours
were
rather
long
the
work
was
routine
and
his
companions
though
pleasant
were
satisfied
with
their
own
careers
they
were
not
looking
ahead
and
dreaming
of
the
day
when
they
might
wear
one
of
the
little
badges
which
identified
a
department
of
justice
agent
then
bob
realized
that
he
must
stop
his
day
dreaming
or
was
it
day
dreaming
after
all
his
uncle
had
said
that
there
was
now
a
possibility
that
he
might
join
the
department
but
this
was
no
time
to
ponder
about
that
he
could
think
of
his
future
when
he
returned
to
his
room
bob
went
to
a
filing
case
which
was
along
the
inside
wall
of
the
room
and
extracted
a
folder
taking
it
back
to
his
desk
he
started
making
entries
of
the
papers
which
were
on
his
desk
he
worked
slowly
but
thoroughly
and
his
handwriting
was
clear
and
definite
others
might
be
faster
than
bob
in
the
filing
work
in
the
division
but
there
were
none
more
accurate
and
when
his
work
was
done
the
chief
of
the
division
always
knew
that
the
task
was
well
cared
for
bob
worked
for
more
than
an
hour
stopping
only
once
or
twice
to
straighten
up
in
his
chair
for
it
was
tiring
work
going
back
to
the
desk
after
a
full
day
of
the
same
type
of
work
when
the
file
was
complete
he
returned
it
to
the
case
along
the
wall
and
sorted
the
papers
which
remained
on
his
desk
they
belonged
in
four
different
files
and
he
drew
these
from
the
cases
and
placed
them
in
a
row
atop
his
desk
the
air
in
the
room
seemed
stuffy
and
bob
walked
to
one
of
the
windows
and
opened
it
several
enough
to
let
in
fresh
air
yet
not
far
enough
for
the
sharp
wind
to
blow
rain
into
the
room
far
below
him
a
car
horn
shrieked
as
an
unwary
pedestrian
tried
to
beat
a
stop
light
bob
went
back
to
his
desk
another
hour
and
his
work
would
be
done
he
picked
up
his
pen
and
resumed
the
task
bob
later
recalled
that
he
had
heard
a
clock
boom
out
the
hour
of
nine
and
it
must
have
been
nearly
half
an
hour
later
when
the
door
which
led
to
the
corridor
opened
quietly
and
a
man
stepped
inside
the
young
clerk
at
his
desk
was
so
intent
upon
his
work
that
he
did
not
sense
there
was
a
newcomer
in
the
room
until
the
visitor
was
almost
behind
him
then
bob
swung
around
with
a
jerk
and
recognized
tully
ross
there
was
a
momentary
flare
of
anger
in
bob
s
face
next
time
you
come
in
make
a
little
noise
he
snapped
i
thought
a
ghost
was
creeping
up
on
i
m
not
much
of
a
ghost
retorted
tully
taking
off
his
topcoat
and
shaking
it
vigorously
to
get
the
water
off
i
didn
t
know
you
would
be
working
couldn
t
get
through
this
afternoon
replied
bob
and
so
much
material
has
been
coming
in
lately
i
was
afraid
that
if
i
let
it
go
another
day
i
d
be
next
time
that
happens
let
me
know
and
i
ll
give
you
a
hand
volunteered
tully
as
he
sat
down
at
his
own
desk
which
was
two
down
from
bob
bob
nearly
laughed
aloud
for
the
thought
of
tully
volunteering
to
help
anyone
else
was
almost
fantastic
each
clerk
had
a
special
type
of
filing
and
each
was
not
supposed
to
exchange
work
with
the
other
in
this
way
there
was
little
chance
for
the
others
to
know
what
documents
were
going
through
for
permanent
filing
thanks
tully
that
s
nice
of
you
said
bob
but
i
don
t
know
what
the
chief
would
he
d
never
need
to
know
said
tully
swinging
around
in
his
chair
but
if
he
did
find
out
that
we
were
helping
each
other
we
d
both
be
out
of
a
job
and
i
can
t
afford
to
take
that
kind
of
a
neither
can
i
right
now
conceded
tully
but
i
hope
to
get
into
something
better
soon
this
doesn
t
pay
enough
for
a
fellow
with
my
brains
and
i
ll
admit
that
it
doesn
t
pay
a
whole
lot
replied
bob
but
a
fellow
has
to
eat
these
some
day
i
m
going
to
be
over
in
the
department
of
justice
said
tully
definitely
it
may
not
be
tomorrow
or
next
week
but
i
m
going
to
get
i
think
you
will
agreed
bob
you
ve
got
the
determination
to
keep
at
it
until
you
what
he
failed
to
add
was
that
tully
s
uncle
would
do
everything
in
his
power
to
see
that
tully
got
the
promotion
and
it
was
no
secret
that
condon
adams
had
powerful
political
connections
that
might
be
helpful
in
getting
tully
into
the
bureau
of
investigation
chapter
iv
the
door
moves
tully
was
in
a
talkative
mood
and
at
such
times
he
displayed
a
pleasing
personality
this
was
one
of
those
times
but
to
bob
it
was
more
than
a
little
irritating
for
he
had
work
to
do
and
every
minute
passed
in
talking
with
tully
meant
additional
time
at
his
desk
i
ve
had
a
funny
feeling
lately
that
things
were
tightening
up
in
here
said
tully
even
tonight
this
room
doesn
t
feel
just
it
s
the
wind
and
the
rain
said
bob
looking
up
from
his
work
when
the
sun
is
out
tomorrow
you
ll
feel
much
i
don
t
know
about
that
say
bob
you
haven
t
heard
of
anything
special
breaking
something
may
be
coming
over
from
the
engineers
that
is
unusually
bob
couldn
t
honestly
say
no
so
he
made
an
indefinite
answer
there
s
always
talk
he
said
sure
i
know
but
this
time
it
s
different
i
ve
heard
that
the
radio
division
has
made
some
startling
discoveries
that
more
than
one
foreign
power
would
give
a
few
millions
to
have
in
its
what
for
instance
that
s
just
it
confessed
tully
there
s
only
vague
talk
nothing
you
can
put
your
finger
i
thought
they
kept
that
stuff
pretty
well
under
cover
said
bob
who
was
determined
to
feel
out
tully
and
learn
just
how
much
the
other
clerk
knew
it
was
evident
now
that
condon
adams
had
been
talking
to
his
nephew
probably
telling
him
in
substance
much
of
what
merritt
hughes
had
divulged
to
bob
earlier
in
the
evening
and
now
tully
was
on
a
fishing
expedition
to
learn
just
what
bob
knew
well
two
could
play
that
game
and
bob
his
head
bent
over
his
work
smiled
to
himself
well
they
never
advertise
the
papers
they
re
sending
over
for
the
permanent
files
tully
said
but
you
know
how
things
get
around
in
the
department
sometimes
we
have
a
pretty
good
idea
what
s
going
through
even
though
it
is
all
under
seal
and
in
a
special
bob
nodded
for
tully
was
right
in
spite
of
the
secrecy
which
usually
surrounded
the
filing
of
important
documents
the
clerks
often
knew
what
was
going
through
their
hands
for
even
the
walls
in
washington
seemed
to
have
eyes
and
ears
and
whispers
flitted
from
one
department
to
another
in
a
mysterious
underground
manner
which
was
impossible
to
stop
sometimes
the
conjecture
of
the
clerks
was
right
again
they
might
all
be
wrong
but
it
was
on
such
talk
as
this
that
secrets
sometimes
slipped
away
and
into
the
hands
of
men
and
women
for
whom
they
had
never
been
intended
bob
s
division
which
filed
all
of
the
radio
documents
had
enjoyed
a
particularly
good
record
the
chief
arthur
jacobs
had
been
in
charge
since
before
world
war
days
and
he
had
used
extreme
care
in
the
selection
of
the
personnel
there
was
yet
to
come
the
first
major
leak
and
bob
hoped
fervently
that
it
would
not
happen
while
he
was
in
the
division
tully
puttered
around
his
own
desk
shoving
papers
here
and
there
and
obviously
making
an
effort
to
appear
interested
once
he
glanced
sharply
at
bob
who
was
intent
on
his
own
work
finally
tully
stood
up
and
walked
to
one
of
the
windows
he
gazed
out
for
several
minutes
and
bob
glancing
up
at
him
got
the
impression
that
tully
was
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
the
next
thing
bob
noticed
tully
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
pulling
open
one
of
the
filing
cases
the
floor
was
carpeted
and
his
steps
from
the
window
to
the
filing
cases
had
been
noiseless
there
was
no
rule
against
a
clerk
opening
one
of
the
cases
for
the
documents
kept
there
were
of
no
major
importance
something
in
tully
s
attitude
caught
bob
s
attention
then
he
realized
that
tully
was
looking
into
one
of
the
files
which
was
under
bob
s
supervision
and
there
was
a
strict
rule
against
that
bob
hesitated
for
a
moment
it
seemed
a
little
foolish
to
make
an
issue
over
that
probably
tully
had
done
it
absentmindedly
then
he
remembered
his
uncle
s
warning
to
watch
everything
going
on
in
the
division
tully
you
re
in
the
wrong
file
said
bob
tully
turned
around
quickly
his
face
flushing
darkly
no
harm
i
guess
i
just
wondered
what
you
ve
been
doing
and
how
you
ve
been
handling
your
file
i
heard
jacobs
complimenting
you
the
other
day
and
thought
i
could
get
some
good
pointers
by
looking
your
stuff
that
s
okay
tully
i
ll
show
you
sometime
when
jacobs
is
here
but
you
know
the
rule
about
the
files
i
ll
have
to
ask
you
to
close
that
and
suppose
i
don
t
snapped
tully
oh
you
ll
close
it
all
right
said
bob
his
voice
was
still
calm
and
even
but
there
was
a
note
of
warning
that
tully
dared
not
ignore
bob
closed
the
file
on
his
desk
and
stood
up
stretching
his
long
powerful
arms
tully
didn
t
miss
the
significance
of
the
motion
for
bob
had
a
well
founded
reputation
as
a
boxer
tully
turned
back
to
the
filing
case
and
slammed
the
steel
drawer
shut
there
you
are
pollyanna
he
retorted
that
file
doesn
t
look
so
good
after
just
so
it
suits
jacobs
that
s
all
that
concerns
me
said
bob
sitting
down
again
tully
picked
up
his
topcoat
to
leave
well
anyway
i
don
t
envy
you
staying
on
here
alone
tonight
this
place
is
giving
me
the
after
tully
had
departed
bob
was
able
to
concentrate
fully
on
his
own
work
a
clock
boomed
out
again
but
he
was
too
preoccupied
to
count
the
number
of
strokes
for
all
he
knew
it
might
have
been
ten
o
clock
or
perhaps
even
eleven
a
sharp
knock
at
the
door
disturbed
bob
who
is
it
he
demanded
guard
just
checking
up
how
long
are
you
going
to
be
here
it
was
the
first
time
in
many
nights
of
overtime
work
that
a
guard
had
ever
checked
up
but
bob
decided
that
it
might
be
a
new
rule
placed
in
effect
without
his
knowledge
half
an
hour
at
least
he
replied
apparently
satisfied
the
guard
moved
on
and
bob
could
hear
his
footsteps
growing
fainter
as
he
bent
to
his
task
again
but
he
was
not
to
work
long
uninterruptedly
the
telephone
buzzed
and
there
was
obvious
irritation
in
his
voice
when
he
answered
but
it
vanished
when
he
recognized
his
uncle
s
voice
i
was
a
little
worried
explained
merritt
hughes
when
i
phoned
your
room
and
found
you
weren
t
in
everything
all
right
yes
except
i
ve
had
too
many
interruptions
said
bob
then
he
hastened
to
explain
i
don
t
mean
you
though
tully
ross
was
in
and
sat
around
for
nearly
an
hour
without
doing
anything
except
making
me
did
he
hint
at
anything
asked
bob
s
uncle
yes
the
same
thing
you
mentioned
evidently
condon
adams
has
told
him
about
it
you
know
tully
wants
a
position
in
the
bureau
of
investigation
sure
every
youngster
in
the
country
would
like
it
replied
merritt
hughes
better
stop
for
tonight
and
run
along
home
and
get
some
sleep
i
want
you
on
the
alert
every
hour
of
the
day
you
re
in
the
office
from
now
i
ll
be
through
in
less
than
half
an
hour
promised
bob
then
i
ll
go
directly
it
s
a
bad
night
and
getting
worse
take
a
taxi
and
don
t
run
the
risk
of
catching
this
bob
promised
to
do
and
with
a
sigh
hung
up
the
telephone
receiver
and
bent
once
more
to
the
task
of
finishing
the
filing
as
the
hours
of
the
night
advanced
the
wind
grew
colder
and
bob
arose
and
closed
the
window
the
air
in
the
room
was
now
damp
and
it
would
have
been
easy
to
allow
his
mind
to
run
riot
for
the
building
was
strangely
silent
noises
from
the
street
far
below
were
smothered
in
the
sound
of
the
rain
driven
against
the
windows
a
slight
creak
startled
bob
and
he
whirled
toward
the
door
even
in
the
dim
light
which
his
desk
light
cast
he
could
see
the
handle
of
the
door
moving
fascinated
he
watched
the
handle
was
moving
slowly
as
though
every
effort
was
being
made
to
guard
against
any
possible
noise
bob
remained
motionless
in
his
chair
as
though
he
had
suddenly
turned
to
stone
chapter
v
a
sliver
of
steel
the
time
seemed
endless
actually
it
could
only
have
been
seconds
that
bob
sat
there
watching
the
turning
of
the
doorknob
then
the
knob
started
back
unseen
fingers
had
learned
what
they
wanted
to
know
the
door
was
not
locked
through
the
hulking
building
there
seemed
no
sound
except
bob
s
own
strained
breathing
in
the
corridor
it
was
as
quiet
as
in
the
room
yet
someone
must
be
outside
the
door
testing
the
lock
bob
shook
his
head
he
must
be
dreaming
his
nerves
must
be
from
too
much
work
and
on
edge
from
the
talk
he
had
earlier
in
the
evening
with
his
uncle
reaching
out
he
tilted
the
shade
of
his
desk
lamp
back
and
a
flood
of
light
struck
the
doorknob
no
his
eyes
had
not
tricked
him
the
knob
was
still
turning
there
was
a
faint
click
and
then
the
knob
remained
stationary
bob
leaped
into
action
in
one
fast
lunge
he
was
across
the
room
his
hands
gripping
the
doorknob
he
tugged
hard
but
the
door
refused
to
open
then
he
paused
for
hurried
footsteps
were
going
down
the
hall
bob
shouted
lustily
perhaps
his
cry
would
reach
the
guard
at
the
elevators
then
he
shook
the
door
it
couldn
t
be
locked
of
that
he
felt
sure
bracing
himself
again
he
tugged
at
the
door
and
almost
fell
over
backwards
when
it
suddenly
opened
bob
stepped
into
the
corridor
there
was
no
one
in
sight
but
from
a
distance
he
could
hear
someone
hurrying
toward
him
a
guard
came
around
a
turn
in
the
corridor
did
you
call
just
then
demanded
the
watchman
i
ll
say
i
did
replied
bob
someone
was
trying
the
door
here
and
when
i
tried
to
open
it
the
door
stuck
then
i
let
out
a
whoop
didn
t
you
see
anyone
no
one
came
my
way
said
the
guard
quickly
but
his
eyes
did
not
meet
bob
s
squarely
we
d
better
look
along
this
end
of
the
corridor
if
someone
was
here
he
might
have
slipped
into
one
of
the
other
bob
shook
his
head
no
he
wouldn
t
have
done
that
besides
i
distinctly
remember
hearing
him
running
down
toward
the
well
i
wasn
t
asleep
and
no
one
came
my
way
insisted
the
guard
maybe
you
were
dreaming
a
little
you
look
kind
of
i
am
tired
but
this
was
no
dream
insisted
bob
then
he
remembered
the
door
what
had
made
it
stick
it
hadn
t
been
locked
give
me
your
flashlight
said
bob
and
the
guard
handed
over
a
shiny
metal
tube
bob
turned
the
beam
of
light
on
the
floor
and
searched
closely
what
are
you
looking
for
asked
the
guard
for
the
reason
why
the
door
stuck
said
bob
tartly
then
he
found
thin
sliver
of
steel
that
had
been
inserted
as
a
wedge
it
was
an
innocent
enough
looking
piece
but
when
placed
properly
in
a
door
could
cause
considerable
delay
bob
picked
it
up
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
although
he
was
not
aware
of
it
at
the
time
it
was
the
first
piece
of
evidence
in
a
mystery
which
was
to
pull
him
deep
into
its
folds
and
require
weeks
of
patient
effort
to
untangle
the
guard
had
edged
over
to
the
door
and
now
reached
out
to
pull
it
shut
only
a
sharp
order
from
bob
stopped
him
keep
your
hands
off
the
doorknob
he
ordered
someone
was
tampering
here
and
i
don
t
want
you
messing
your
hands
around
the
the
guard
hesitated
as
though
undecided
whether
to
obey
bob
and
the
clerk
stood
up
and
doubled
up
a
fist
better
not
touch
that
there
was
a
steelly
quietness
in
the
words
that
decided
the
guard
and
he
stepped
well
back
into
the
corridor
you
d
better
get
back
to
your
post
i
ll
take
care
of
this
situation
said
bob
i
ll
keep
your
flashlight
and
return
it
to
you
when
i
leave
the
building
i
want
to
do
a
little
scouting
around
and
may
need
this
the
guard
grumbled
something
under
his
breath
but
retreated
down
the
corridor
and
finally
vanished
from
sight
bob
disliked
him
thoroughly
for
his
attitude
had
been
one
of
sullen
defiance
so
unusual
from
the
men
generally
on
duty
at
night
it
might
be
well
to
speak
to
jacobs
about
it
in
the
morning
just
to
make
sure
that
no
one
came
along
and
touched
the
doorknob
bob
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
tied
it
around
the
knob
in
a
manner
which
would
protect
possible
fingerprints
that
done
he
picked
up
the
flashlight
again
and
started
to
reconnoiter
in
the
corridor
trying
one
door
after
another
there
was
just
a
possibility
that
the
marauder
had
found
a
hiding
place
in
an
office
which
had
been
left
unlocked
bob
knew
that
it
was
almost
a
useless
quest
for
the
offices
were
checked
each
night
he
made
the
rounds
along
one
side
of
the
corridor
and
started
back
on
the
side
opposite
his
own
office
the
night
lights
were
on
and
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
use
the
flashlight
door
after
door
proved
unyielding
to
his
touch
and
he
was
about
to
give
up
the
quest
when
he
came
upon
a
door
that
swung
inward
when
his
hands
gripped
the
knob
bob
drew
back
suddenly
and
flashed
the
beam
of
light
into
the
long
room
which
was
almost
identical
with
the
one
in
which
he
had
been
working
what
he
saw
there
startled
him
more
than
he
dared
to
admit
later
and
he
stepped
inside
and
moved
toward
the
nearest
desk
the
ray
from
the
flashlight
revealed
the
utter
confusion
in
the
room
baskets
of
papers
on
top
of
the
desks
had
been
upset
and
even
the
drawers
in
the
filing
cabinets
had
been
pulled
out
and
their
contents
hurled
indiscriminately
over
the
floor
a
slight
sound
startled
bob
and
he
swung
around
the
beam
of
light
focusing
on
the
door
it
was
and
silently
bob
leaped
forward
stumbled
over
a
wastepaper
basket
and
then
reached
the
door
which
clicked
shut
just
before
he
could
grasp
the
handle
bob
tugged
hard
on
the
door
but
like
the
one
which
led
to
his
own
office
it
stuck
could
it
be
another
wedge
of
steel
bob
wondered
and
braced
himself
for
another
lusty
tug
the
door
gave
way
and
bob
toppled
backward
in
a
heap
the
flashlight
falling
and
blinking
out
bob
had
fallen
heavily
and
for
a
moment
he
remained
motionless
on
the
floor
listening
for
the
sound
of
someone
moving
along
the
corridor
he
could
have
shouted
for
the
guard
but
an
inward
distrust
of
the
man
kept
him
from
doing
that
instead
he
groped
around
for
the
flashlight
turned
it
on
and
got
to
his
feet
considerably
shaken
in
mind
and
body
by
the
experiences
of
the
last
few
minutes
the
young
clerk
reached
for
the
light
switch
and
a
glare
of
light
flooded
the
room
revealing
even
further
the
destruction
which
had
been
wrought
there
bob
looked
around
hundreds
of
papers
had
been
strewn
on
the
floor
some
of
them
had
been
ruthlessly
destroyed
and
he
wondered
how
many
valuable
documents
would
be
lost
when
they
finally
checked
up
but
this
was
no
time
for
inaction
he
decided
and
he
hastened
to
one
of
the
desks
and
picked
up
a
telephone
he
dialed
quickly
but
it
was
nearly
a
minute
before
a
sleepy
voice
answered
hello
uncle
merritt
asked
bob
anxiously
no
i
m
not
home
i
m
still
at
the
building
i
wish
you
d
get
down
here
as
soon
as
you
can
no
i
haven
t
had
an
accident
but
some
mighty
strange
things
have
been
going
on
around
this
floor
tonight
one
of
the
offices
has
been
completely
ransacked
i
m
in
it
now
papers
have
been
thrown
all
over
and
the
filing
cases
opened
and
a
lot
of
stuff
destroyed
who
did
it
gosh
i
wish
i
knew
someone
s
been
shutting
doors
on
me
and
leaving
steel
wedges
in
them
it
s
giving
me
the
i
ll
be
right
down
promised
the
department
of
justice
agent
bob
placed
the
receiver
back
on
its
hook
and
backed
out
of
the
room
the
fewer
things
he
touched
the
better
it
would
be
and
as
he
drew
the
door
shut
he
was
careful
to
keep
his
hands
off
the
knob
for
there
was
a
possibility
of
valuable
fingerprints
being
there
an
eerie
feeling
raced
up
and
down
bob
s
spine
as
he
turned
toward
the
door
which
opened
into
the
office
where
he
worked
the
building
was
so
quiet
it
was
disturbing
yet
he
knew
some
unknown
marauder
had
been
busy
on
the
floor
while
he
had
been
bent
over
his
desk
could
the
unknown
be
after
the
radio
secrets
his
uncle
had
hinted
about
it
was
certainly
worth
considering
bob
reached
the
door
that
led
into
the
office
where
he
worked
and
stopped
suddenly
he
felt
cold
all
over
as
he
stared
at
the
doorknob
he
remembered
distinctly
having
wrapped
his
own
handkerchief
around
the
knob
to
preserve
possible
fingerprints
but
there
was
no
handkerchief
there
now
and
the
door
was
slightly
ajar
the
light
had
been
on
when
he
stepped
into
the
hall
but
now
the
room
was
in
inky
darkness
chapter
vi
in
the
darkened
room
bob
paused
on
the
threshold
of
the
long
office
staring
into
the
blackness
of
the
room
after
his
recent
experiences
he
couldn
t
be
blamed
for
hesitating
a
moment
should
he
close
the
door
back
into
the
hall
and
await
his
uncle
s
arrival
or
should
he
snap
on
the
lights
and
see
what
had
taken
place
in
the
room
it
seemed
to
bob
that
he
pondered
those
questions
for
several
minutes
actually
it
was
less
than
five
seconds
he
reached
for
the
light
switch
at
the
left
of
the
doorway
and
pushed
the
button
but
there
was
no
answering
blaze
of
light
only
the
dead
click
of
the
switch
bob
knew
then
that
the
lights
had
been
tampered
with
that
more
than
likely
someone
was
lurking
in
the
shadowy
darkness
of
the
office
his
better
judgment
told
him
to
wait
until
he
could
summon
assistance
but
some
other
urge
drove
him
on
he
couldn
t
explain
it
later
he
simply
went
ahead
the
young
filing
clerk
stepped
across
the
threshold
the
flashlight
in
his
hand
aimed
down
the
center
of
the
room
then
he
turned
on
the
flash
and
a
beam
of
light
cut
through
the
darkness
bob
gasped
the
light
showed
papers
strewn
over
the
floor
and
the
drawers
from
desks
and
filing
cases
pulled
indiscriminately
out
and
dumped
on
the
floor
the
shock
of
the
confusion
in
the
office
brought
him
up
short
then
he
started
to
swing
the
light
about
the
room
to
determine
the
full
extent
of
the
damage
by
the
marauder
a
slight
noise
to
the
right
caught
bob
s
attention
and
he
turned
in
that
direction
instinctively
he
knew
that
danger
lurked
there
and
he
tensed
his
body
it
came
before
he
was
ready
something
hurtling
out
of
the
dark
something
that
struck
his
right
hand
a
numbing
blow
something
that
sent
the
flashlight
crashing
to
the
floor
where
the
lens
and
the
bulb
shattered
and
the
light
went
out
but
the
blow
sent
bob
into
action
he
must
get
back
to
the
door
and
get
it
closed
that
would
cut
off
the
one
avenue
of
escape
for
the
intruder
the
clerk
leaped
backward
his
hands
reaching
out
for
the
doorway
he
collided
with
someone
else
someone
wearing
a
topcoat
still
damp
from
the
rain
outside
bob
thought
quickly
he
must
find
some
way
to
stop
the
other
if
for
only
an
instant
he
drew
back
his
right
foot
and
swift
kick
connected
with
the
unknown
s
shins
with
such
force
that
an
involuntary
cry
rang
through
the
room
bob
leaped
on
and
crashed
into
the
half
opened
door
with
anxious
fingers
he
found
the
key
on
the
inside
slammed
the
door
shut
and
turned
the
lock
that
done
bob
dropped
down
on
the
floor
where
he
would
have
a
chance
to
rest
to
collect
his
wits
and
to
plan
his
future
course
of
action
for
a
time
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
he
could
not
even
catch
the
breathing
of
the
other
man
and
he
thought
of
the
possibility
that
the
other
had
slipped
out
the
door
before
he
had
closed
it
then
he
dismissed
that
as
an
impossibility
for
there
had
not
been
sufficient
time
for
that
bob
knew
every
inch
of
the
long
office
knew
where
every
desk
and
chair
was
located
and
every
window
as
his
eyes
became
more
accustomed
to
the
dark
he
could
pick
out
the
lighter
blots
which
were
the
windows
then
a
slight
noise
caught
his
attention
the
unknown
was
moving
probably
on
his
hands
and
knees
feeling
his
way
toward
the
door
bob
couldn
t
resist
a
chuckle
as
he
thought
of
the
dismay
that
would
spread
through
the
other
when
he
found
the
door
securely
locked
and
the
key
missing
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
bob
edged
away
from
the
door
and
sought
shelter
behind
a
nearby
desk
to
make
sure
that
he
would
move
noiselessly
he
slipped
off
his
shoes
and
placed
them
beside
a
filing
cabinet
where
he
wouldn
t
fall
over
them
if
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
make
a
sudden
move
strangely
enough
bob
felt
very
calm
his
heart
beat
rapidly
and
his
breath
came
shorter
and
faster
but
his
mind
was
remarkably
clear
his
hands
steady
he
was
glad
now
that
he
did
not
have
the
flashlight
for
using
it
would
only
have
made
him
a
target
for
the
marauder
bob
wondered
how
long
it
would
take
his
uncle
to
reach
the
scene
probably
another
ten
minutes
for
merritt
hughes
lived
a
considerable
distance
from
the
building
what
might
happen
inside
that
room
in
the
next
ten
minutes
was
something
that
bob
didn
t
care
to
guess
about
as
bob
listened
he
could
hear
the
almost
noiseless
movements
of
the
other
man
and
knew
that
he
was
nearing
the
door
then
he
heard
hands
moving
along
the
the
gentle
turning
of
the
doorknob
then
there
was
the
sharp
rattle
of
the
knob
as
though
a
sudden
wave
of
anger
had
swept
over
the
man
at
the
realization
that
he
had
been
trapped
in
the
room
bob
moved
away
from
the
door
crawling
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
he
kept
going
until
he
was
well
down
the
room
and
right
at
the
steel
cabinet
where
the
radio
documents
were
filed
with
cautious
hands
he
felt
along
the
front
of
the
case
so
far
the
drawers
had
not
been
pulled
out
for
they
were
identified
only
by
key
numbers
instead
of
by
the
name
of
the
type
of
papers
which
they
contained
this
was
one
cabinet
bob
was
determined
to
protect
for
after
what
his
uncle
had
told
him
earlier
in
the
night
he
felt
sure
that
this
was
the
object
of
the
unknown
s
visit
once
more
the
doorknob
was
rattled
sharply
then
silence
again
shrouded
the
room
and
bob
felt
his
nerves
tightening
it
was
tough
waiting
alone
in
the
darkness
he
wondered
if
the
other
man
possessed
a
gun
and
if
he
would
have
the
nerve
to
use
it
if
an
emergency
caught
him
bob
strained
his
ears
for
some
sound
of
the
other
s
maneuvers
a
faint
sort
of
plop
made
him
smile
it
sounded
very
much
like
a
shoe
being
placed
gently
on
the
floor
several
seconds
later
there
was
a
similar
sound
and
bob
knew
that
they
were
now
on
even
terms
neither
one
of
them
having
his
shoes
on
this
man
was
no
fool
he
was
determined
to
keep
his
own
movements
as
secret
as
possible
then
bob
heard
a
sound
which
was
anything
but
heartening
the
unknown
was
coming
toward
him
he
could
hear
the
gentle
scrape
of
knees
as
the
man
crawled
along
the
floor
he
was
evidently
feeling
his
way
along
the
filing
cabinets
and
bob
moved
out
toward
the
center
of
the
room
where
he
found
protection
between
two
desks
set
fairly
close
together
his
action
was
not
a
minute
too
soon
for
he
had
barely
settled
himself
in
his
new
position
when
he
saw
a
darker
shadow
moving
along
in
front
of
the
filing
cases
the
man
was
less
than
six
feet
away
and
breathing
very
quietly
but
steadily
bob
held
his
own
breath
as
the
man
passed
along
the
row
of
filing
cases
evidently
he
was
going
to
make
the
rounds
of
the
room
in
an
effort
to
catch
bob
by
surprise
overpower
him
and
take
away
the
key
bob
chuckled
inwardly
at
that
thought
he
was
too
familiar
with
the
room
to
be
caught
in
that
manner
moving
out
slightly
from
behind
the
shelter
of
the
desks
he
saw
the
man
reach
a
window
and
raise
his
head
so
that
he
could
look
down
on
the
street
it
was
a
temptation
that
bob
couldn
t
resist
and
he
picked
up
an
inkwell
on
the
desk
beside
him
took
careful
aim
and
hurled
the
heavy
glass
container
just
as
he
threw
the
inkwell
bob
slipped
and
the
noise
attracted
the
attention
of
the
other
man
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
whirled
about
the
glass
container
instead
of
striking
the
man
s
head
hit
his
shoulder
glanced
into
the
window
and
crashed
its
way
on
out
into
the
darkness
there
was
a
cry
of
pain
from
the
intruder
and
then
a
sharp
burst
of
flame
as
a
bullet
scarred
the
top
of
the
desk
which
shielded
bob
bob
went
cold
all
over
there
was
no
more
fun
in
this
thing
it
was
deadly
serious
now
and
he
knew
that
his
very
life
might
depend
on
the
events
of
the
coming
minutes
for
this
man
was
cornered
and
capable
of
shooting
his
way
out
if
necessary
chapter
vii
sirens
in
the
night
as
the
echoes
of
the
shot
died
in
the
room
bob
realized
that
he
had
been
foolish
in
throwing
the
inkwell
it
had
unduly
alarmed
the
other
man
and
placed
his
own
life
in
jeopardy
the
slug
from
the
gun
had
come
much
closer
than
bob
wanted
it
to
there
was
only
one
consolation
the
shot
should
attract
the
attention
of
the
guards
on
duty
in
the
building
and
within
a
minute
they
should
be
at
the
door
battering
their
way
in
against
superior
numbers
bob
felt
that
the
intruder
would
not
put
up
a
resistance
with
gun
play
bob
stared
at
the
windows
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
unknown
had
disappeared
and
the
distant
noises
of
the
street
were
clearer
now
drifting
in
through
the
broken
window
merritt
hughes
should
arrive
at
almost
any
minute
and
bob
felt
that
the
wise
and
sensible
thing
now
was
to
play
as
safe
as
possible
and
await
the
arrival
of
help
crouched
down
between
the
desks
he
was
in
a
position
to
watch
the
file
with
the
radio
documents
and
he
knew
that
if
they
were
molested
he
would
fight
with
all
his
strength
to
protect
them
as
the
seconds
passed
into
minutes
bob
felt
his
muscles
tensing
and
his
nerves
becoming
tighter
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
there
had
been
no
sound
since
the
echoes
of
the
shot
had
died
away
had
his
missile
disabled
the
other
man
had
the
shot
been
fired
involuntarily
they
were
questions
he
couldn
t
answer
why
didn
t
a
night
guard
appear
in
the
corridor
outside
bob
believed
that
he
would
have
risked
a
call
for
help
if
anyone
passed
but
strain
as
he
might
he
could
hear
no
one
outside
the
door
then
bob
broke
into
a
cold
sweat
the
man
who
had
fired
the
shot
was
almost
beside
him
bob
had
been
so
intent
upon
listening
for
some
sound
in
the
corridor
that
he
had
failed
to
hear
the
unknown
crawling
toward
his
own
hiding
place
bob
sensed
rather
than
saw
what
was
happening
he
could
hear
the
steady
breathing
of
the
other
and
he
held
his
own
breath
would
the
man
crawl
on
down
the
room
toward
the
doorway
or
would
he
turn
in
between
the
desks
where
bob
had
sought
shelter
the
dark
blob
that
was
the
other
s
head
and
shoulders
appeared
between
the
desks
and
bob
waited
for
an
agonizing
interval
then
the
figure
moved
on
and
bob
could
breathe
once
more
that
had
been
a
close
call
then
came
another
sound
that
brought
bob
back
to
the
alert
there
was
the
faint
shrilling
of
a
siren
was
it
a
fire
alarm
bob
listened
intently
no
it
was
sharper
more
penetrating
a
police
car
that
was
it
it
was
evident
that
the
other
man
had
also
heard
the
night
alarm
for
bob
heard
a
muffled
exclamation
he
doubted
if
it
was
an
alarm
turned
in
by
his
uncle
for
his
protection
but
at
least
it
was
enough
to
alarm
the
marauder
and
bob
s
muscles
snapped
back
to
steelly
tension
he
had
gone
so
far
now
that
he
had
no
intention
of
allowing
the
other
to
escape
at
the
last
minute
the
steady
wail
of
the
siren
drew
nearer
as
down
on
the
avenue
the
speeding
machine
dashed
through
traffic
lights
and
skidded
past
other
machines
which
were
pulling
over
to
give
it
the
right
of
way
the
siren
rose
to
a
crescendo
and
then
died
to
a
wail
as
the
police
car
swayed
to
a
stop
somewhere
below
and
bob
knew
then
that
rescue
was
near
his
uncle
feeling
the
need
for
quick
had
evidently
called
on
the
washington
police
and
commandeered
a
cruising
radio
car
from
somewhere
out
of
the
darkness
came
a
low
deadly
voice
listen
kid
this
spot
is
getting
tough
give
me
the
key
to
this
door
or
i
m
going
to
turn
this
gun
loose
and
it
will
be
just
too
bad
if
i
get
you
i
ve
got
plenty
of
extra
clips
and
i
m
going
out
of
here
on
my
feet
give
me
that
key
bob
knew
there
was
no
time
to
lose
for
there
was
a
ring
of
panic
in
the
other
s
voice
and
you
never
could
tell
what
a
man
would
do
the
desks
afforded
little
protection
from
a
barrage
of
bullets
and
bob
quickly
edged
his
way
out
from
behind
them
and
in
between
two
steel
filing
cases
while
these
were
not
intended
to
be
bullet
proof
at
least
they
were
much
better
than
oak
desks
did
you
hear
me
called
the
voice
from
near
the
doorway
give
me
that
bob
slipped
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
pulled
out
a
key
ring
the
key
to
his
own
room
was
somewhat
similar
to
the
one
that
fitted
the
door
of
this
office
he
quickly
detached
this
and
tossed
it
toward
the
door
he
couldn
t
afford
to
cry
out
now
for
he
knew
the
man
near
the
door
would
shoot
the
key
fell
on
the
floor
and
he
could
hear
the
frantic
efforts
of
the
other
to
locate
it
then
came
a
gasp
of
relief
from
the
unknown
and
bob
heard
him
fumbling
at
the
keyhole
trying
to
insert
the
key
and
turn
it
in
the
lock
there
was
a
sharp
cry
from
the
man
at
the
door
you
ve
tricked
me
give
me
the
right
key
give
it
to
me
the
voice
was
nearing
a
hysterical
pitch
and
bob
smiled
grimly
the
man
couldn
t
stand
the
dark
and
the
certain
knowledge
that
outside
men
were
speeding
toward
that
very
room
men
who
would
shoot
first
and
ask
questions
afterward
bob
wondered
whether
tossing
another
key
would
again
trick
the
man
at
the
door
before
he
could
decide
there
was
a
stab
of
flame
in
the
blackness
and
a
bullet
crashed
through
the
desks
where
he
had
been
hiding
come
on
give
me
that
key
the
voice
was
hysterical
now
a
scream
that
cut
through
the
room
and
echoed
out
the
shattered
window
down
below
another
police
siren
was
ebbing
as
a
second
car
pulled
up
at
the
curb
and
disgorged
its
load
of
armed
men
who
rushed
into
the
building
to
follow
the
lead
of
the
first
detail
bob
faintly
heard
elevator
doors
clang
open
it
would
be
only
seconds
now
until
they
were
at
the
door
beating
their
way
in
by
this
time
bob
s
eyes
were
well
accustomed
to
the
darkness
and
he
could
distinguish
the
shadow
of
the
man
crouched
near
the
door
listening
now
to
the
pounding
of
the
police
as
they
charged
up
the
long
corridor
bob
bob
where
are
you
it
was
merritt
hughes
and
bob
thrilled
at
the
voice
of
his
uncle
then
dismay
filled
him
for
he
knew
what
would
happen
if
they
broke
down
the
door
and
charged
into
the
room
for
a
trapped
man
is
always
dangerous
fists
beat
against
the
door
and
two
ribbons
of
flame
streaked
from
the
gun
the
bullets
crashing
through
the
door
and
out
into
the
corridor
bob
couldn
t
help
shouting
a
warning
keep
away
he
s
desperate
the
answer
to
that
was
another
shot
into
the
desks
where
he
had
been
hiding
and
bob
knew
that
the
man
felt
sure
he
was
still
hiding
there
there
was
a
sudden
silence
in
the
corridor
and
bob
knew
that
his
uncle
and
the
police
were
conferring
on
the
best
way
to
break
into
the
room
as
he
listened
he
saw
the
man
near
the
door
moving
backing
down
into
the
room
where
bob
was
hiding
and
if
he
kept
on
coming
he
would
pass
within
a
foot
or
less
of
bob
bob
felt
his
muscles
tightening
and
he
breathed
deeply
if
he
could
only
disable
the
unknown
it
would
solve
what
promised
to
become
a
highly
dangerous
situation
the
man
was
coming
noiselessly
in
his
stocking
feet
his
head
cocked
toward
the
door
where
he
listened
for
some
further
move
a
yard
two
feet
and
now
only
inches
separated
them
bob
was
ready
his
hands
shot
out
and
caught
the
other
man
in
a
steelly
grasp
that
choked
an
involuntary
cry
from
him
at
the
same
time
bob
kicked
with
all
of
his
strength
the
blow
caught
the
other
man
behind
the
knees
and
bob
could
feel
him
crumpling
the
gun
which
he
had
feared
the
most
clattered
to
the
floor
and
they
were
on
equal
terms
ready
now
to
fight
hand
to
hand
as
they
fell
the
other
man
twisted
about
and
bob
knew
that
his
adversary
was
no
weakling
he
could
feel
the
muscles
of
the
other
man
s
arms
tightening
and
a
short
sickening
blow
that
started
at
the
floor
caught
him
on
the
chin
bob
was
weak
all
over
for
a
moment
an
interval
just
long
enough
to
give
the
other
a
chance
to
collect
his
wits
then
bob
was
at
him
again
his
arms
held
in
close
his
fists
raining
blows
like
a
trip
hammer
they
were
hard
fierce
jabs
that
would
have
rocked
an
ordinary
man
to
sleep
in
less
than
ten
seconds
he
heard
the
other
gasp
as
a
right
caught
him
in
the
midriff
but
he
came
back
for
more
fighting
in
the
dark
was
dangerous
business
a
wild
blow
might
send
his
hand
crashing
into
a
steel
case
or
against
a
desk
and
his
knuckles
might
be
broken
but
it
was
a
chance
bob
had
to
take
and
he
slammed
away
with
a
will
suddenly
the
man
went
limp
bob
caught
him
fearing
a
ruse
and
shot
home
one
more
hard
right
then
he
knew
that
the
other
was
cold
and
he
suddenly
went
weak
himself
fists
were
beating
against
the
door
open
up
open
up
it
was
merritt
hughes
voice
bob
managed
a
reply
coming
he
called
just
a
you
all
right
demanded
the
federal
agent
but
bob
was
too
weak
and
tired
to
reply
somehow
he
managed
to
dig
the
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
with
trembling
fingers
he
found
the
keyhole
inserted
the
key
and
turned
the
lock
the
door
burst
open
to
reveal
bob
standing
on
wavering
legs
and
merritt
hughes
caught
him
just
as
he
collapsed
chapter
viii
the
paper
vanishes
lights
from
a
whole
battery
of
flashlights
seemed
to
blaze
down
at
bob
and
he
blinked
hard
as
merritt
hughes
leaned
over
him
bob
bob
are
you
hurt
demanded
the
ace
federal
agent
bob
managed
to
shake
his
head
just
then
he
was
too
exhausted
even
to
talk
as
he
watched
the
flashlights
swept
around
the
room
revealing
its
wild
disorder
then
the
lights
focused
on
the
form
of
a
man
sprawled
out
under
the
nearest
desk
and
bob
caught
his
breath
for
the
man
was
in
a
uniform
of
one
of
the
night
watchmen
so
that
was
the
reason
why
there
had
been
no
response
to
his
calls
for
help
the
marauder
had
been
the
guard
merritt
hughes
stepped
over
to
the
unconscious
form
and
gazed
at
the
man
s
face
you
certainly
landed
a
haymaker
on
one
eye
he
told
bob
know
who
he
is
bob
managed
to
sit
up
where
he
could
glimpse
the
other
man
he
s
the
guard
who
was
on
duty
tonight
he
said
but
i
don
t
know
his
name
he
is
a
new
merritt
hughes
chuckled
grimly
well
he
s
going
to
a
lot
different
place
maybe
he
ll
be
able
to
remember
his
name
and
tell
us
a
few
things
when
he
wakes
up
now
just
what
happened
here
it
s
a
long
story
began
bob
then
save
it
until
we
re
alone
later
was
anyone
else
running
around
up
here
tonight
except
yourself
and
the
guard
bob
thought
instantly
of
tully
ross
then
decided
to
wait
and
tell
his
uncle
about
that
when
they
were
alone
this
fellow
was
the
only
intruder
replied
bob
which
was
true
enough
for
tully
belonged
to
the
office
staff
take
him
down
to
the
nearest
station
and
have
him
fingerprinted
and
photographed
the
federal
agent
told
the
policemen
the
officers
leaned
down
and
picked
up
the
man
bob
had
fought
and
managed
somehow
to
get
him
to
his
feet
supporting
him
on
their
shoulders
they
walked
him
down
the
hall
and
bob
heard
the
elevator
doors
click
bob
s
uncle
tried
to
turn
on
the
lights
in
the
room
but
the
switches
though
they
snapped
as
usual
failed
to
send
any
current
into
the
lights
fuses
blown
bob
heard
him
mutter
they
were
alone
now
the
police
having
departed
with
their
prisoner
here
s
an
extra
flashlight
bob
see
if
you
can
find
anything
missing
by
making
a
hurried
search
around
the
room
directed
merritt
hughes
bob
felt
stronger
now
and
he
got
to
his
feet
he
was
still
a
little
unsteady
but
the
cool
rain
washed
air
coming
in
sharp
gusts
through
the
window
now
cleared
his
head
and
he
took
the
flashlight
which
his
uncle
offered
the
twin
beams
of
light
swept
around
the
room
what
a
mess
exclaimed
the
federal
agent
as
the
lights
revealed
the
utter
confusion
who
s
in
charge
he
asked
arthur
jacobs
is
the
filing
chief
for
this
room
replied
bob
then
you
d
better
get
him
on
the
telephone
and
see
that
he
gets
down
here
at
once
explain
what
s
happened
and
tell
him
that
you
want
to
check
over
the
files
for
any
possible
missing
bob
looked
up
the
number
of
the
filing
chief
s
home
telephone
and
dialed
it
was
some
time
before
a
sleepy
voice
answered
and
when
bob
informed
the
filing
chief
who
was
speaking
the
voice
was
sharp
and
angry
but
when
he
imparted
the
news
and
added
that
a
federal
agent
was
waiting
for
his
arrival
and
the
checkup
the
filing
chief
promised
to
come
down
at
once
in
the
meantime
a
janitor
came
up
from
somewhere
below
and
fixed
the
fuses
so
that
there
was
ample
light
in
the
long
room
i
can
start
in
checking
up
on
the
files
now
said
bob
but
his
uncle
held
out
his
hand
i
don
t
want
a
thing
touched
until
the
filing
chief
is
here
he
explained
then
if
something
important
is
missing
you
ll
have
a
clean
bill
of
but
i
m
sure
that
nothing
important
has
come
through
lately
said
bob
of
course
we
don
t
know
definitely
when
important
records
are
being
filed
but
we
usually
have
a
pretty
good
then
here
s
hoping
that
your
hunch
has
been
right
replied
his
uncle
bob
told
him
about
the
condition
of
the
other
room
down
the
hall
and
they
went
there
and
examined
it
at
some
length
finally
deciding
to
lock
and
seal
the
door
until
morning
when
a
more
thorough
inspection
could
be
made
by
the
time
they
were
back
in
the
room
where
bob
worked
the
elevator
doors
clanged
open
and
they
could
hear
impatient
footsteps
hurrying
toward
them
arthur
jacobs
short
heavy
and
fairly
popped
through
the
door
his
blue
eyes
went
wide
as
he
saw
the
litter
of
papers
in
the
room
and
bob
felt
sorry
for
the
filing
chief
for
jacobs
had
a
splendid
record
of
efficiency
what
under
the
sun
happened
demanded
jacobs
i
m
afraid
i
was
so
sleepy
i
was
sharp
with
you
over
the
phone
he
told
bob
i
guess
i
would
have
been
a
little
provoked
at
being
routed
out
at
this
time
of
night
admitted
bob
i
guess
my
uncle
can
tell
you
better
than
i
arthur
jacobs
after
glancing
again
at
the
wild
confusion
of
papers
on
the
floor
faced
the
federal
agent
merritt
hughes
described
the
events
of
the
night
briefly
and
bob
saw
the
filing
chief
casting
anxious
glances
toward
one
of
the
steel
cabinets
his
own
heart
missed
a
beat
or
two
for
the
cabinet
that
appeared
to
be
worrying
the
filing
chief
was
the
one
in
which
the
newest
radio
documents
were
kept
it
was
here
that
any
papers
relating
to
new
discoveries
in
this
field
would
be
placed
but
bob
managed
to
reassure
himself
he
was
convinced
that
only
the
man
he
had
caught
could
have
been
in
the
room
and
there
had
been
no
way
for
him
to
get
rid
of
any
papers
which
he
might
have
stolen
from
the
file
then
arthur
jacobs
interrupted
the
federal
agent
just
a
minute
some
important
papers
came
through
late
this
afternoon
and
i
placed
them
in
one
of
the
files
myself
i
want
to
be
sure
that
they
re
the
filing
chief
stepped
to
the
radio
filing
cabinet
and
skimmed
through
the
papers
with
expert
fingers
bob
saw
the
frown
of
anxiety
deepen
on
the
filing
chief
s
face
as
his
fingers
sorted
the
documents
expertly
jacobs
shook
his
head
and
then
bent
down
and
scanned
each
document
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
case
anything
important
missing
asked
merritt
hughes
jacobs
didn
t
answer
at
once
and
when
he
finally
looked
up
bob
read
the
answer
in
his
face
yes
said
the
filing
chief
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
carried
only
a
few
feet
the
papers
which
came
over
this
afternoon
have
chapter
ix
suspicions
bob
and
his
uncle
stared
at
arthur
jacobs
with
unbelieving
eyes
and
the
filing
chief
saw
their
doubt
the
papers
are
i
tell
his
voice
rose
almost
to
a
frenzy
for
this
was
the
first
time
that
such
a
thing
had
occurred
in
his
usually
well
ordered
and
carefully
routined
department
and
he
had
visions
of
losing
his
job
yes
yes
we
heard
you
replied
merritt
hughes
but
perhaps
you
missed
them
in
going
through
the
file
let
s
go
through
it
won
t
do
any
good
said
jacobs
in
a
flat
and
hopeless
voice
i
know
this
file
from
a
to
z
and
the
papers
that
came
in
this
afternoon
are
not
the
federal
agent
paused
and
looked
hard
at
the
filing
chief
you
say
they
were
important
papers
jacobs
nodded
they
were
so
important
that
i
refused
to
trust
them
to
anyone
you
re
sure
no
one
in
the
department
knew
these
papers
were
coming
through
insisted
the
federal
agent
i
can
t
be
sure
replied
the
filing
chief
for
there
has
been
talk
drifting
around
the
last
few
days
about
some
important
radio
discoveries
that
have
been
made
by
the
army
engineers
but
i
am
sure
that
no
one
knew
the
exact
time
these
papers
came
was
it
a
complete
file
on
the
new
discoveries
asked
merritt
hughes
anxiously
i
don
t
know
but
from
the
usual
procedure
i
would
say
that
it
was
only
a
partial
file
just
as
a
precautionary
step
they
usually
send
the
records
of
new
formulas
and
developments
over
in
several
sections
so
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
take
one
section
and
know
what
it
was
all
but
you
re
not
sure
about
this
special
file
no
except
that
it
was
small
a
single
sheet
of
paper
in
a
sturdy
manila
we
d
better
go
through
everything
in
the
room
decided
bob
s
uncle
and
they
got
down
on
their
hands
and
knees
and
started
rummaging
through
the
litter
of
papers
it
would
take
days
to
place
these
back
in
their
proper
sequences
and
bob
felt
sorry
for
jacobs
they
finished
one
side
of
the
room
and
started
down
another
there
was
no
sign
of
the
missing
envelope
and
bob
s
uncle
phoned
the
precinct
police
station
to
learn
if
such
an
envelope
had
been
found
on
the
prisoner
search
him
again
he
instructed
the
police
when
they
informed
him
that
no
envelope
or
papers
of
any
description
had
been
found
bob
looked
toward
the
half
opened
window
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
possible
for
him
to
toss
that
paper
out
the
window
and
have
it
picked
up
by
someone
on
the
ground
he
asked
merritt
hughes
went
to
the
window
and
looked
down
it
was
better
than
a
hundred
feet
to
the
ground
and
the
sharpness
of
the
wind
had
not
lessened
he
shook
his
head
i
don
t
think
that
happened
he
said
it
would
have
been
too
risky
either
that
paper
is
still
in
this
room
or
it
was
taken
out
by
that
fellow
when
he
but
the
police
haven
t
found
anything
protested
bob
sometimes
even
the
police
slip
up
when
they
run
into
an
especially
clever
crook
and
this
man
had
to
be
clever
to
get
in
here
in
a
guard
s
uniform
and
stand
night
their
search
of
the
room
neared
an
end
and
arthur
jacobs
looked
even
more
downcast
i
knew
it
was
missing
when
i
failed
to
find
it
in
the
file
he
groaned
this
is
where
i
lose
my
don
t
worry
about
that
we
ve
got
to
find
this
paper
first
said
merritt
hughes
go
through
the
file
once
with
the
federal
agent
on
one
side
and
bob
on
the
other
the
filing
chief
examined
every
paper
in
the
cabinet
but
without
success
merritt
hughes
turned
on
his
nephew
you
re
sure
that
you
were
the
only
one
in
this
office
until
this
fellow
got
in
he
asked
bob
bob
hesitated
wondering
whether
he
dared
implicate
tully
ross
by
mentioning
his
name
but
tully
had
been
there
and
the
disappearance
of
the
radio
document
was
too
important
to
let
anything
like
that
interfere
he
decided
well
tully
ross
dropped
in
for
a
few
minutes
said
bob
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
this
in
the
first
place
asked
the
federal
agent
and
bob
felt
the
color
in
his
cheeks
mounting
at
the
rebuke
which
was
implied
by
his
uncle
s
words
chapter
x
on
the
ledge
arthur
jacobs
wheeled
around
sharply
at
the
exchange
between
uncle
and
nephew
what
was
ross
doing
here
at
night
demanded
the
filing
chief
i
guess
he
just
dropped
in
saw
the
lights
burning
up
here
and
wondered
what
was
going
on
replied
bob
did
he
touch
anything
work
on
anything
there
was
a
desperate
note
of
anxiety
in
the
filing
chief
s
voice
and
bob
knew
that
jacobs
was
thinking
only
of
the
reputation
of
his
department
rather
than
linking
tully
to
the
events
of
the
night
no
he
only
offered
to
help
me
but
i
told
him
i
was
getting
along
all
right
said
bob
did
he
ask
you
about
any
of
the
papers
you
were
filing
pressed
the
federal
agent
well
not
exactly
but
he
did
mention
something
about
the
radio
secrets
that
s
been
more
or
less
common
knowledge
in
the
department
that
something
big
was
breaking
and
we
have
all
been
curious
about
did
tully
touch
this
file
or
go
into
it
demanded
the
filing
chief
bob
hesitated
tully
had
looked
into
the
file
but
he
hadn
t
removed
anything
bob
was
sure
well
did
he
touch
anything
pressed
jacobs
he
did
open
this
file
admitted
bob
but
i
looked
up
just
then
and
i
am
sure
that
he
didn
t
remove
anything
in
fact
i
don
t
think
he
touched
anything
inside
the
why
did
he
open
the
file
asked
merritt
hughes
well
he
mentioned
something
about
wanting
to
see
the
way
i
kept
my
files
i
guess
he
said
he
had
heard
jacobs
say
he
liked
the
way
i
handled
jacobs
smiled
for
it
was
no
secret
with
him
that
bob
was
his
star
assistant
while
tully
was
probably
the
poorest
of
the
clerks
who
worked
in
the
filing
room
you
re
sure
tully
didn
t
take
anything
out
insisted
his
uncle
i
can
t
be
positive
said
bob
but
i
don
t
believe
anything
was
removed
by
merritt
hughes
was
silent
for
a
minute
when
he
spoke
again
he
addressed
his
words
to
bob
get
tully
on
the
telephone
and
tell
him
to
dress
and
get
down
here
right
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
bob
knew
that
it
would
be
useless
to
say
anything
more
in
defense
of
the
other
clerk
and
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
dialed
tully
s
apartment
number
it
was
two
o
clock
now
and
an
unearthly
hour
to
rout
anyone
out
of
bed
so
bob
prepared
himself
for
a
long
wait
at
the
telephone
he
was
not
disappointed
for
it
was
at
least
three
minutes
before
a
sleepy
voice
answered
and
bob
recognized
it
as
that
of
tully
when
he
explained
that
the
other
clerk
must
come
down
at
once
there
were
sleepy
protests
and
bob
s
uncle
provoked
at
tully
s
attitude
took
the
phone
tully
this
is
merritt
hughes
there
s
been
trouble
in
this
office
tonight
you
are
one
of
two
outsiders
who
were
in
here
if
you
know
what
s
good
for
you
get
down
here
at
once
and
don
t
with
that
he
hung
up
the
receiver
without
giving
tully
an
opportunity
to
answer
i
think
he
ll
be
down
without
losing
any
time
he
said
and
bob
was
ready
to
agree
tully
lived
some
distance
from
the
office
bob
knew
that
it
would
be
nearly
half
an
hour
before
he
could
arrive
let
me
have
a
flashlight
he
said
to
his
uncle
and
i
ll
go
down
on
the
ground
floor
and
see
if
there
is
any
chance
that
paper
was
thrown
from
the
merritt
hughes
nodded
his
agreement
and
handed
a
light
to
bob
i
ll
go
along
said
arthur
jacobs
i
can
t
stay
up
here
and
do
the
filing
chief
was
visibly
shaken
and
bob
was
glad
enough
to
have
companionship
for
there
would
be
no
fun
in
prowling
through
the
shrubbery
at
the
base
of
the
building
at
that
hour
of
the
night
they
walked
down
the
corridor
together
and
turned
and
faced
the
elevator
entrance
the
cage
came
up
in
answer
to
their
summons
and
they
dropped
swiftly
toward
the
first
floor
find
out
yet
what
happened
to
the
regular
guard
on
our
floor
bob
asked
the
elevator
operator
they
ve
checked
his
home
but
he
left
there
right
on
time
it
s
a
cinch
he
never
reached
here
though
this
building
has
been
searched
from
top
to
bottom
and
there
s
no
sign
of
when
they
stepped
out
on
the
main
floor
there
was
evidence
of
suppressed
activity
for
several
guards
flashlights
in
their
hands
hurried
past
them
they
re
even
searching
the
closets
volunteered
the
elevator
operator
for
the
fellow
who
was
caught
up
on
your
floor
was
wearing
the
guard
s
bob
whistled
softly
this
was
getting
more
serious
every
minute
he
wondered
about
phoning
the
news
upstairs
to
his
uncle
but
he
decided
against
that
they
would
soon
return
to
the
upper
floor
and
he
could
tell
him
then
the
night
was
as
blustery
as
ever
and
bob
drew
his
topcoat
close
as
the
first
gust
of
wind
and
rain
swept
down
on
them
the
flashlights
threw
feeble
glows
ahead
of
them
as
they
floundered
through
the
shrubbery
which
flanked
the
base
of
the
building
ouch
cried
the
filing
chief
as
a
piece
of
shrubbery
snapped
into
his
face
and
bob
turned
to
help
him
go
on
i
m
all
right
said
jacobs
and
they
pushed
ahead
bob
in
the
lead
back
and
forth
they
beat
their
way
through
the
shrubbery
their
lights
held
close
to
the
ground
time
after
time
they
stopped
to
pick
up
a
sheet
of
paper
in
the
faint
hope
that
it
might
be
the
missing
radio
document
they
were
seeking
so
anxiously
now
they
were
directly
under
the
windows
of
the
office
bob
looking
up
could
see
the
glow
of
lights
from
the
windows
here
they
were
doubly
careful
to
make
a
thorough
search
and
arthur
jacobs
went
over
every
inch
of
the
ground
with
his
own
light
stooping
to
be
sure
that
no
scrap
of
paper
went
unobserved
the
quest
looked
hopeless
and
bob
stood
up
to
ease
his
aching
back
guess
we
might
as
well
give
up
he
said
tully
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
and
we
ll
want
to
be
back
upstairs
when
he
there
s
just
a
chance
the
paper
might
have
been
blown
around
the
corner
said
the
filing
chief
who
was
determined
to
cling
to
even
the
most
slender
hope
well
there
s
a
chance
but
it
s
a
mighty
slim
one
we
ll
have
a
try
though
agreed
bob
the
rain
was
even
sharper
as
they
turned
to
the
corner
of
the
building
and
the
lights
attempted
to
pierce
the
blackness
of
the
hour
for
five
minutes
they
crawled
back
and
forth
underneath
the
shrubbery
bob
was
chilled
now
and
a
trickle
of
water
coming
off
his
hat
and
dropping
down
his
neck
did
nothing
to
improve
his
spirits
his
knees
and
back
ached
and
it
would
seem
good
to
get
back
into
the
office
where
it
was
light
and
warm
and
there
would
be
no
rain
to
face
i
guess
we
ve
looked
under
every
shrub
on
this
side
of
the
building
finally
said
arthur
jacobs
and
there
was
a
bitter
note
of
disappointment
in
his
voice
we
might
as
well
give
up
and
go
bob
straightened
up
and
the
beam
from
his
flashlight
struck
one
of
the
deep
recessed
windows
that
were
on
the
ground
floor
the
ledge
in
front
of
the
window
itself
was
at
least
two
feet
wide
and
it
was
on
this
ledge
that
the
beam
of
light
centered
bob
cried
out
involuntarily
and
arthur
jacobs
hearing
the
cry
whirled
to
his
side
something
was
on
that
ledge
something
that
was
shrouded
in
black
bob
s
heart
leaped
with
an
emotion
that
was
one
of
combined
fear
and
curiosity
and
with
jacobs
at
his
side
he
plunged
forward
through
the
shrubbery
chapter
xi
strained
tempers
bob
was
the
first
to
reach
the
ledge
which
was
about
two
feet
above
the
ground
level
and
well
protected
from
the
onslaughts
of
the
storm
his
flashlight
revealed
the
figure
of
a
man
swathed
in
a
dark
blanket
jammed
up
against
the
window
bob
was
reaching
for
the
blanket
when
arthur
jacobs
seized
his
arm
don
t
we
d
better
wait
until
we
can
get
your
uncle
down
no
decided
bob
we
ll
find
out
what
this
is
all
about
right
with
that
he
pulled
the
blanket
off
the
figure
and
stared
down
into
the
eyes
of
the
guard
who
was
usually
on
duty
on
his
floor
a
gag
which
had
been
ruthlessly
put
in
place
made
speech
for
the
captive
out
of
the
question
run
for
help
bob
told
arthur
jacobs
and
the
filing
chief
departed
as
rapidly
as
his
short
legs
would
carry
him
while
he
was
waiting
for
help
bob
busied
himself
in
an
effort
to
unfasten
the
captive
s
bonds
picture
wire
had
been
used
to
bind
the
man
s
hands
and
wrists
and
the
gag
was
of
rough
heavy
material
which
was
held
in
place
by
strips
of
adhesive
tape
it
was
to
this
that
bob
gave
his
first
attention
for
from
the
expression
in
the
guard
s
eyes
he
knew
that
the
gag
was
causing
him
untold
agony
with
capable
but
gentle
fingers
bob
worked
at
the
gag
until
the
cruel
bandage
was
freed
he
bent
down
close
to
hear
the
first
whisper
from
the
man
s
lips
water
please
bob
half
propped
the
captive
up
and
then
turned
in
quest
of
some
water
anything
halfway
decent
would
do
nearby
a
small
torrent
was
coming
from
one
of
the
drain
spouts
it
had
been
raining
for
hours
so
the
spouting
should
have
been
clean
the
filing
clerk
cupped
his
hands
under
the
spout
and
got
a
double
handful
of
water
this
he
carried
back
to
the
ledge
and
let
it
trickle
into
the
other
s
mouth
he
was
just
finishing
his
task
when
arthur
jacobs
followed
by
half
a
dozen
guards
appeared
on
the
run
the
beams
from
their
flashlights
cutting
a
broad
swath
of
light
through
the
darkness
the
guards
picked
up
the
captive
and
carried
him
inside
blankets
were
produced
the
wire
was
cut
from
his
hands
and
feet
by
this
time
merritt
hughes
who
had
been
notified
was
down
on
the
ground
floor
he
took
charge
immediately
get
this
man
to
a
hospital
at
once
he
directed
two
of
you
go
along
to
see
that
he
talks
with
no
one
understand
no
one
i
ll
be
around
soon
and
talk
with
him
as
soon
as
they
get
him
into
bed
and
take
every
precaution
to
avoid
bob
felt
sorry
for
the
guard
he
had
been
stripped
of
his
uniform
bound
and
gagged
and
had
been
helpless
on
the
ledge
for
hours
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
he
did
not
suffer
an
attack
of
pneumonia
an
ambulance
which
had
been
summoned
arrived
and
they
saw
the
guard
lifted
into
the
vehicle
two
other
guards
climbed
in
beside
him
remember
no
one
is
to
talk
with
him
until
i
arrive
merritt
hughes
ordered
as
they
turned
to
the
building
the
federal
agent
spoke
to
bob
tully
ross
got
here
just
before
the
guard
was
found
come
along
upstairs
while
i
question
they
were
waiting
for
the
elevator
when
a
short
man
hastened
in
he
was
scowling
and
obviously
had
been
routed
out
of
bed
merritt
hughes
turned
to
greet
the
newcomer
and
as
he
recognized
him
there
was
no
cordiality
in
the
greeting
hello
adams
he
said
i
didn
t
expect
to
see
you
here
i
ll
bet
you
didn
t
snapped
the
other
but
don
t
think
for
a
minute
you
can
my
nephew
and
get
away
with
what
do
you
mean
you
know
darned
well
what
i
mean
didn
t
you
just
phone
tully
ross
and
order
him
down
here
didn
t
you
practically
threaten
him
i
wouldn
t
call
it
exactly
a
threat
but
i
did
tell
him
to
get
down
here
at
once
if
he
knew
what
was
good
for
him
no
clerk
is
going
to
be
impudent
with
merritt
hughes
spoke
firmly
and
calmly
but
there
was
something
in
the
flash
of
his
eyes
that
told
condon
adams
that
he
had
gone
far
enough
if
you
want
to
come
along
while
i
talk
with
tully
you
re
quite
welcome
he
added
condon
adams
grunted
and
shouldered
his
way
ahead
of
them
and
into
the
elevator
they
were
silent
as
they
rode
up
to
the
top
floor
and
strode
down
the
corridor
to
the
office
where
tully
ross
was
waiting
for
them
tully
s
dark
rather
handsome
face
was
marked
by
frowns
as
he
saw
bob
enter
behind
merritt
hughes
now
what
s
been
going
on
here
demanded
condon
adams
as
he
surveyed
the
room
with
cool
calculating
eyes
suddenly
he
saw
the
radio
file
and
he
swung
to
face
merritt
hughes
this
case
getting
hot
he
shot
the
question
out
in
short
words
bob
s
uncle
nodded
looks
like
fine
one
you
are
not
to
let
me
know
said
adams
bitterly
i
don
t
recall
that
you
ve
ever
tipped
me
off
to
any
breaks
in
any
case
we
ve
worked
on
before
said
merritt
hughes
coolly
when
you
get
in
that
habit
i
ll
try
to
learn
your
telephone
condon
adams
snorted
about
what
i
expected
well
let
s
get
along
here
what
happened
you
ll
learn
all
that
in
good
time
said
bob
s
uncle
right
now
i
m
in
charge
and
i
want
to
know
why
tully
came
up
to
the
office
tonight
and
why
he
tried
to
look
through
the
radio
file
speak
up
there
isn
t
much
to
tell
began
tully
i
was
going
by
and
when
i
saw
the
lights
on
in
the
office
i
came
up
just
curiosity
i
sure
it
wasn
t
anything
more
then
why
did
you
try
to
look
into
the
radio
file
tully
shot
a
bitter
glance
at
bob
for
he
realized
that
bob
was
the
only
source
of
information
on
his
activities
while
he
was
in
the
room
that
was
curiosity
too
you
know
there
s
been
talk
around
about
some
important
papers
coming
arthur
jacobs
wrung
his
hands
talk
talk
talk
are
there
no
secrets
any
more
in
this
department
not
many
retorted
tully
who
appeared
to
take
malicious
glee
in
taunting
the
filing
chief
that
s
enough
tully
you
know
there
have
been
serious
happenings
bob
was
attacked
by
a
marauder
who
had
gone
through
the
files
what
was
he
doing
out
of
the
room
how
did
anyone
get
in
it
was
condon
adams
turn
to
speak
bob
replied
sharply
explaining
what
had
happened
i
d
call
it
mighty
poor
judgment
on
your
part
to
leave
this
room
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
said
adams
i
think
i
ll
lodge
a
complaint
against
that
s
going
far
enough
merritt
hughes
said
firmly
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
kind
if
this
thing
is
going
to
get
as
personal
as
that
i
ll
file
one
against
your
nephew
for
coming
up
here
and
attempting
to
get
into
a
file
that
is
prohibited
to
him
now
how
would
you
like
that
it
was
obvious
that
adams
did
not
relish
the
suggestion
and
the
whole
matter
of
filing
complaints
was
dropped
right
there
merritt
hughes
took
charge
then
questioning
tully
carefully
about
all
of
his
actions
while
he
was
in
the
room
tully
was
surly
but
he
answered
truthfully
enough
how
about
it
bob
asked
the
federal
agent
what
s
the
matter
doubt
my
word
flared
tully
his
dark
face
flushing
simply
checking
said
bob
s
uncle
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
invited
no
further
remarks
from
tully
tully
s
told
exactly
what
happened
up
until
the
time
he
left
the
room
said
bob
then
suppose
you
tell
us
what
happened
after
he
left
and
you
were
left
here
alone
interjected
condon
adams
there
was
an
unpleasant
inflection
in
his
voice
that
bob
resented
an
implication
that
bob
might
have
been
responsible
for
whatever
had
taken
place
that
night
merritt
hughes
got
it
too
but
he
ignored
it
bob
told
his
story
in
a
manner
once
or
twice
adams
interrupted
to
ask
questions
but
he
gained
little
satisfaction
from
his
efforts
to
heckle
bob
well
we
ve
got
two
more
sources
of
information
said
merritt
hughes
one
is
the
man
who
was
captured
in
this
room
and
the
other
is
the
guard
who
was
found
on
the
ledge
down
which
one
are
you
going
to
question
first
asked
adams
i
don
t
know
it
s
late
now
i
think
i
ll
see
them
in
the
not
trying
to
give
me
the
slip
are
you
the
words
shot
out
of
adams
mouth
which
was
twisted
into
a
bitter
sneer
i
m
simply
handling
this
case
in
my
own
way
replied
merritt
hughes
evenly
oh
i
don
t
know
whether
it
s
your
case
or
not
remember
that
both
of
us
have
been
assigned
to
this
radio
angle
well
you
do
the
work
and
i
ll
get
the
information
out
of
your
reports
it
will
save
me
a
lot
of
tedious
detail
come
on
condon
adams
moving
as
rapidly
as
his
short
thick
legs
would
carry
him
left
the
room
and
tully
with
a
backward
glance
of
mingled
relief
and
unsatisfied
curiosity
trailed
after
him
merritt
hughes
watching
them
depart
shook
his
head
and
bob
heard
his
uncle
mutter
what
a
precious
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
asked
bob
we
re
going
home
and
get
some
sleep
you
ve
been
through
enough
for
one
night
jacobs
see
that
he
is
relieved
of
routine
tomorrow
i
want
him
with
me
when
i
question
these
i
ll
make
the
necessary
arrangements
promised
the
filing
chief
who
was
still
looking
disconsolately
at
the
mess
of
papers
scattered
over
the
floor
use
bob
as
long
as
you
need
him
and
i
ll
fix
up
the
reports
here
good
luck
and
good
good
night
replied
the
federal
agent
and
bob
echoed
the
words
they
strode
down
the
hall
together
entered
the
elevator
and
when
they
reached
the
entrance
of
the
building
were
fortunate
enough
to
hail
an
owl
cab
which
went
cruising
by
the
air
was
fresh
but
the
rain
coming
down
steadily
was
driven
by
a
sharp
wind
and
the
night
was
as
raw
as
ever
chapter
xii
steps
in
the
hall
bob
leaned
back
in
the
taxi
it
was
restful
listening
to
the
steady
hum
of
the
tires
on
the
wet
pavement
his
uncle
looked
at
him
quizzically
pretty
much
all
in
he
asked
bob
nodded
well
i
m
willing
to
admit
that
i
m
more
than
a
little
tired
and
my
muscles
ache
a
good
bit
from
that
tussle
in
the
dark
back
in
the
office
i
thought
for
a
minute
that
fellow
was
going
to
get
away
from
me
it
s
a
good
thing
you
put
in
an
appearance
when
you
i
knew
speed
was
essential
and
i
corralled
a
few
of
the
local
police
to
help
me
out
chuckled
merritt
hughes
still
think
you
d
like
to
be
a
real
federal
agent
and
how
said
bob
sincerely
it
s
got
the
thrilling
kind
of
a
life
i
d
like
to
don
t
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
it
is
all
thrills
and
fun
there
are
months
upon
months
when
the
cases
are
the
merest
of
routines
and
the
work
is
real
drudgery
but
every
so
often
something
bobs
up
that
does
add
a
zest
to
living
where
do
you
suppose
that
radio
document
went
i
wish
i
knew
jacobs
will
worry
himself
sick
until
it
is
recovered
i
knew
something
was
in
the
air
but
none
of
us
thought
anything
important
had
been
sent
well
someone
knew
it
and
that
someone
must
have
had
inside
knowledge
there
was
no
guess
work
in
rifling
those
no
but
someone
got
into
the
wrong
office
the
first
time
said
bob
recalling
the
ransacking
of
the
other
office
on
the
same
corridor
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
the
thin
steel
wedges
which
had
been
used
in
the
doors
snapping
on
the
dome
light
in
the
taxi
he
held
them
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
these
wedges
were
used
in
an
attempt
to
lock
the
doors
and
keep
me
in
he
explained
i
forgot
all
about
them
until
just
now
what
do
you
make
of
them
his
uncle
looked
at
them
sharply
but
refused
to
touch
them
pulling
out
a
clean
handkerchief
he
had
bob
drop
the
wedges
into
the
cloth
covered
them
carefully
and
placed
them
in
an
inside
pocket
i
ll
turn
them
over
to
the
laboratory
they
may
be
able
to
find
some
fingerprints
if
they
haven
t
been
handled
by
too
many
i
m
the
only
one
who
s
handled
them
outside
of
the
man
who
put
them
in
place
declared
bob
who
felt
that
here
might
be
a
really
important
clue
the
taxi
swung
toward
the
curb
a
dull
light
gleamed
over
the
entrance
of
the
apartment
house
where
bob
had
a
room
sure
you
re
all
right
his
uncle
asked
absolutely
i
ll
take
a
shower
and
hop
into
bed
don
t
forget
to
stop
for
me
when
you
go
down
town
to
interview
those
that
s
a
promise
agreed
the
federal
agent
bob
jumped
out
of
the
cab
hurried
across
the
parking
and
into
the
entrance
of
the
apartment
turning
he
watched
the
cab
pull
away
from
the
curb
then
he
inserted
his
key
in
the
lock
and
entered
the
building
the
air
was
warm
and
dank
and
it
made
him
sleepy
his
room
was
on
the
third
floor
at
the
back
and
the
lights
in
the
hallway
were
none
too
bright
bob
s
room
was
part
of
an
apartment
occupied
by
an
elderly
couple
but
it
had
an
outside
entrance
on
the
hallway
and
he
could
come
and
go
as
he
pleased
another
feature
of
it
was
a
private
bathroom
in
spite
of
its
comparative
luxury
he
was
able
to
obtain
the
room
for
a
rent
well
within
his
modest
means
for
bob
also
acted
as
a
sort
of
caretaker
for
the
apartment
when
the
older
people
were
away
on
one
of
their
extensive
trips
bob
unlocked
the
door
of
his
room
he
had
left
one
window
partially
open
and
the
air
here
was
fresh
turning
on
the
lights
he
undressed
quickly
and
stepped
into
the
bathroom
where
he
was
soon
under
a
shower
a
rough
toweling
down
made
his
body
glow
and
then
he
pulled
on
fresh
pajamas
the
clock
on
the
dresser
showed
the
time
to
be
three
thirty
the
night
was
nearly
gone
when
bob
tumbled
into
bed
and
turned
off
the
light
on
the
bedside
stand
in
less
than
a
minute
he
was
sound
asleep
bob
s
slumber
for
the
first
hour
was
deep
and
dreamless
then
his
mind
as
his
body
threw
off
part
of
the
fatigue
became
restless
and
pictures
of
the
events
of
the
night
flashed
through
his
brain
bob
stirred
restlessly
once
or
twice
and
finally
aroused
enough
to
mutter
in
his
sleep
he
must
have
been
reliving
the
vivid
struggle
in
the
darkness
of
the
office
for
he
was
tense
when
he
sat
up
awake
and
listening
for
some
sound
from
the
hall
sleep
vanished
from
his
eyes
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
someone
was
outside
his
door
trying
the
knob
ever
so
gently
at
that
moment
bob
longed
for
some
other
weapon
than
his
two
capable
hands
the
side
of
the
bed
nearest
the
door
creaked
and
bob
knew
if
he
eased
his
body
over
that
edge
the
creaking
of
the
bed
might
scare
away
the
marauder
moving
cautiously
he
slid
out
the
side
next
to
the
wall
and
put
his
bare
feet
on
the
floor
an
alleyway
ran
back
of
the
apartment
and
a
street
light
at
the
head
of
this
sent
just
enough
light
down
to
mark
the
window
as
a
lighter
square
against
the
general
pattern
of
darkness
this
turning
of
the
doorknob
was
getting
to
be
too
much
for
bob
and
he
cast
about
for
some
object
which
he
could
use
as
a
club
his
golf
bag
was
in
the
corner
and
he
managed
to
extract
a
steel
shafted
midiron
which
would
make
an
excellent
weapon
if
he
had
a
chance
to
swing
it
there
was
no
thought
of
fear
in
bob
s
mind
as
he
moved
toward
the
door
his
bare
feet
padded
softly
across
the
floor
and
he
reached
out
and
touched
the
doorknob
with
his
finger
tips
it
was
moving
for
a
moment
bob
recoiled
like
he
had
been
struck
by
an
electric
shock
then
he
got
a
grip
on
his
nerves
and
reached
down
for
the
key
which
he
had
left
in
the
lock
on
the
inside
of
the
door
to
his
surprise
the
key
was
not
in
the
lock
then
he
understood
the
slight
noise
that
had
aroused
him
whoever
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
had
pushed
the
key
out
of
the
lock
and
the
noise
made
when
it
had
struck
the
floor
had
brought
him
out
of
his
sleep
bob
leaned
down
and
felt
along
the
floor
he
reached
out
in
his
search
for
the
key
became
overbalanced
and
before
he
could
regain
his
equilibrium
dropped
to
his
knees
with
a
thud
that
was
plainly
audible
in
the
hall
bob
s
hands
closed
on
the
key
he
sought
but
as
he
drew
himself
upright
again
he
heard
someone
running
down
the
hall
seconds
later
came
the
slam
of
an
outside
door
and
bob
knew
that
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
any
pursuit
he
turned
on
the
light
and
opened
the
door
the
same
dim
lights
were
burning
in
the
hallway
closing
the
door
he
was
sure
that
it
was
locked
and
then
wedged
a
chair
under
the
doorknob
when
bob
got
back
into
bed
he
was
a
sadly
perplexed
young
filing
clerk
why
should
an
attempt
be
made
to
enter
his
room
the
riddle
was
beyond
him
perhaps
his
uncle
could
solve
it
in
the
morning
chapter
xiii
bob
fights
back
bob
s
nerves
were
tight
the
mystery
of
the
turning
knob
had
aroused
and
sharpened
his
senses
and
sleep
was
slow
in
coming
to
him
again
he
tossed
fitfully
on
the
bed
turning
the
pillow
several
times
in
an
effort
to
find
a
more
comfortable
place
for
his
head
when
he
finally
dropped
asleep
it
was
just
before
dawn
once
asleep
bob
fell
into
a
heavy
slumber
that
was
finally
broken
by
the
strident
ringing
of
the
telephone
at
the
stand
beside
his
bed
it
was
with
an
effort
that
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
reached
sleepily
for
the
instrument
hello
he
said
in
a
voice
still
drugged
with
sleep
then
all
thoughts
of
sleep
were
swept
from
his
mind
by
the
message
which
came
over
the
telephone
it
was
from
his
uncle
the
head
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
wants
you
to
come
down
for
an
interview
at
eleven
o
clock
said
merritt
hughes
think
you
can
make
it
what
time
is
it
now
asked
bob
i
ll
be
there
with
half
an
hour
to
spare
promised
bob
i
ve
got
a
lot
to
tell
anything
happen
there
was
a
note
of
anxiety
in
the
question
not
quite
tell
you
about
it
later
where
will
i
meet
you
the
federal
agent
named
an
office
in
the
department
of
justice
building
and
bob
promised
to
be
there
right
after
breakfast
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
piled
out
of
bed
his
muscles
were
still
a
little
sore
as
a
result
of
the
encounter
of
the
night
before
but
a
snappy
shower
toned
up
his
body
and
when
he
finished
dressing
he
felt
that
he
was
ready
for
anything
the
day
might
have
in
store
in
the
way
of
excitement
and
adventure
bob
put
on
his
topcoat
and
then
removed
the
chair
which
he
had
wedged
under
the
doorknob
in
the
cool
light
of
the
morning
the
events
of
the
night
before
seemed
fantastic
yet
he
knew
that
one
man
was
in
jail
while
another
was
in
a
hospital
bob
stepped
into
the
hall
and
carefully
locked
the
door
more
or
less
as
a
reaction
he
looked
cautiously
up
and
down
the
hall
and
then
laughed
at
himself
it
was
just
a
plain
hall
and
his
fears
seemed
so
ridiculous
now
it
was
o
clock
when
bob
stepped
out
of
the
apartment
building
he
paused
a
moment
to
turn
down
the
brim
of
his
hat
for
the
glare
of
the
sun
was
too
bright
for
unprotected
eyes
across
the
street
a
large
dark
sedan
was
parked
and
several
men
were
apparently
waiting
for
someone
to
emerge
from
the
apartment
house
opposite
bob
turned
and
strode
down
the
street
there
was
ample
time
for
him
to
have
a
leisurely
breakfast
and
still
reach
the
department
of
justice
building
with
plenty
of
time
to
spare
the
young
filing
clerk
stopped
at
a
nearby
restaurant
where
he
usually
had
breakfast
and
ordered
rolls
and
coffee
several
morning
papers
were
on
the
table
and
he
scanned
them
with
unusual
interest
washington
reporters
were
unusually
alert
and
it
was
just
possible
that
they
might
have
received
some
hint
of
what
had
taken
place
last
night
bob
went
through
every
page
but
there
was
no
story
even
remotely
connected
with
the
night
before
he
put
down
the
papers
and
turned
to
his
breakfast
wondering
what
the
chief
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
wanted
of
course
it
must
be
linked
with
the
radio
document
but
bob
felt
that
his
uncle
could
adequately
give
all
of
the
information
needed
then
another
thought
flashed
through
his
head
but
it
seemed
ridiculous
yet
his
uncle
had
mentioned
only
the
night
before
that
there
was
a
possibility
bob
s
great
ambition
was
to
become
an
agent
of
the
department
of
justice
and
in
that
ambition
tully
ross
was
a
bitter
rival
bob
finished
his
breakfast
and
started
walking
toward
the
department
of
justice
building
the
air
was
bracing
and
he
swung
along
at
a
good
pace
unaware
of
a
sedan
which
was
following
at
a
discreet
distance
the
filing
clerk
turned
a
corner
and
started
down
a
little
used
street
which
was
a
toward
his
destination
as
he
turned
the
car
following
him
spurted
forward
and
closed
in
the
distance
bob
was
less
than
fifty
feet
down
the
block
when
the
car
swung
around
the
corner
the
squeal
of
the
tires
as
the
wheels
were
cramped
caught
bob
s
attention
and
he
turned
around
to
look
at
the
sedan
he
recognized
the
machine
instantly
it
was
the
car
which
had
been
parked
across
the
street
from
his
own
apartment
house
something
in
the
intentness
of
the
driver
and
the
alertness
of
the
man
beside
him
sent
a
wave
of
apprehension
pounding
through
bob
s
veins
he
felt
sure
that
the
car
was
on
that
street
for
no
good
purpose
and
he
was
the
only
pedestrian
in
sight
bob
knew
the
short
street
thoroughly
beside
him
was
a
rather
high
iron
fence
that
protected
a
private
home
just
inside
the
fence
was
a
clump
of
barberry
so
thick
they
were
almost
a
jungle
of
shrubbery
there
was
no
protection
across
the
street
and
it
was
a
good
two
hundred
feet
to
the
intersection
where
he
could
hope
to
obtain
help
bob
heard
the
car
slow
down
now
and
he
steeled
himself
for
what
he
felt
was
going
to
be
an
unpleasant
encounter
just
why
he
had
that
premonition
he
could
never
tell
but
in
later
days
his
hunches
were
to
serve
him
well
the
driver
of
the
sedan
had
a
scar
on
his
forehead
while
the
passenger
in
the
front
seat
who
was
nearest
bob
had
red
hair
that
frizzled
out
from
beneath
a
soft
felt
hat
the
car
stopped
at
the
curb
and
the
passenger
jumped
out
leaving
the
door
open
say
buddy
i
m
looking
for
an
address
near
here
maybe
you
can
help
sorry
i
m
afraid
not
i
m
in
a
hurry
retorted
bob
edging
a
little
closer
to
the
iron
picket
fence
oh
i
guess
you
re
not
in
such
a
hurry
matter
of
fact
i
ve
got
a
little
business
with
you
ain
t
you
a
filing
clerk
down
in
the
archives
division
of
the
war
department
maybe
i
am
and
then
maybe
i
m
bob
s
reply
was
crisp
smart
guy
huh
well
i
know
who
you
are
and
i
ve
got
business
with
bob
measured
the
other
wondering
just
how
hard
he
would
have
to
hit
him
to
knock
him
out
the
red
head
was
about
five
feet
eight
tall
but
was
compact
we
re
going
to
take
a
little
ride
and
talk
see
there
was
a
threat
in
every
word
i
m
not
riding
this
morning
he
said
firmly
give
him
a
crack
on
the
noodle
and
drag
him
in
called
the
man
at
the
wheel
of
the
sedan
he
started
to
get
out
of
the
car
and
bob
knew
that
between
the
two
of
them
they
would
be
able
to
overpower
him
you
asked
for
it
he
muttered
as
his
right
swung
in
a
short
hard
chop
that
landed
on
the
s
solar
plexus
the
blow
caught
the
other
man
napping
and
doubled
him
up
bob
was
ready
for
him
and
a
hard
cross
with
his
left
to
the
chin
ended
all
thoughts
of
a
fight
which
might
have
been
in
the
other
s
head
hey
you
yelled
the
driver
you
can
t
get
away
with
bob
saw
him
reaching
for
his
back
pocket
and
tugging
at
something
that
decided
bob
who
felt
sure
the
other
was
reaching
for
a
gun
putting
his
hands
on
the
fence
bob
vaulted
the
iron
barrier
he
landed
in
the
tangle
of
barberry
but
the
shrubbery
was
so
tall
that
he
crashed
through
and
a
protecting
thicket
shielded
him
from
the
eyes
of
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
without
waiting
to
see
what
was
happening
in
the
street
bob
beat
his
way
through
the
shrubbery
the
thorns
tore
at
his
clothes
and
his
hands
were
soon
streaked
with
scratches
but
his
thought
was
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible
in
the
shortest
time
chapter
xiv
special
agent
nine
as
bob
clawed
his
way
through
the
dense
shrubbery
there
was
a
sharp
explosion
behind
him
whether
it
was
a
shot
or
the
exhaust
of
the
sedan
was
something
he
didn
t
stop
to
find
out
when
he
was
finally
clear
of
the
barberry
bob
found
himself
in
a
small
open
yard
in
front
of
the
house
which
was
heavily
shuttered
and
evidently
unoccupied
but
bob
wasted
no
time
in
reconnoitering
the
house
he
kept
on
going
running
around
to
the
rear
the
iron
fence
enclosed
the
whole
property
but
there
was
a
gate
and
he
made
for
this
a
heavy
padlock
secured
the
gate
but
bob
scrambled
over
without
tearing
his
clothes
and
dropped
into
the
alley
from
far
behind
on
the
other
street
he
could
hear
the
heavy
roar
of
an
exhaust
and
he
ducked
into
a
half
opened
garage
on
the
other
side
of
the
alley
for
he
had
no
intention
of
being
caught
out
in
the
open
when
the
noise
of
the
exhaust
finally
died
away
bob
went
back
into
the
alley
a
walk
of
a
block
and
a
half
brought
him
to
a
thoroughfare
and
he
hailed
a
passing
cab
directing
that
he
be
taken
to
the
department
of
justice
building
once
inside
the
cab
bob
sat
back
to
take
stock
of
the
damage
which
the
thorns
of
the
barberry
had
done
to
his
hands
there
were
half
a
dozen
raw
angry
scratches
and
innumerable
little
snags
in
his
suit
from
the
prickly
stuff
when
he
thought
of
what
had
happened
in
the
last
few
minutes
bob
frankly
admitted
that
he
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
it
why
should
he
be
singled
out
for
an
attack
by
a
couple
of
hoodlums
why
should
someone
attempt
to
enter
his
room
in
the
night
perhaps
his
uncle
would
have
the
key
to
answers
when
he
met
him
the
cab
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
department
of
justice
building
and
bob
paid
the
driver
and
stepped
out
several
pedestrians
going
by
looked
at
him
curiously
and
he
realized
that
he
looked
strangely
unkempt
bob
stepped
inside
the
building
his
hands
were
smarting
and
he
took
out
two
clean
handkerchiefs
and
wrapped
them
around
his
hands
there
was
still
a
little
time
before
his
appointment
and
he
turned
around
and
went
to
a
nearby
drug
store
where
he
explained
that
his
hands
had
been
scratched
by
barberry
a
clerk
recommended
an
antiseptic
solution
and
bob
washed
his
hands
thoroughly
in
this
and
then
wrapped
the
handkerchiefs
around
them
again
back
in
the
department
of
justice
building
bob
was
whisked
to
an
upper
floor
and
a
boy
guided
him
to
the
room
he
inquired
for
there
was
no
name
on
the
glass
panel
of
the
doorway
and
bob
stepped
inside
wondering
just
what
kind
of
a
reception
he
was
going
to
have
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
when
he
entered
and
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
near
a
window
to
wait
the
door
opened
again
and
tully
ross
stepped
in
and
stared
at
bob
the
surprise
was
mutual
i
didn
t
expect
to
find
you
here
exclaimed
tully
and
there
was
no
pleasure
in
his
words
guess
that
goes
for
me
too
replied
bob
tully
took
a
chair
a
few
feet
from
bob
and
conversation
ended
right
then
and
there
for
at
least
ten
minutes
no
word
was
spoken
until
an
inner
door
opened
and
merritt
hughes
entered
hello
bob
hello
tully
you
re
right
on
time
edgar
will
be
here
in
a
few
bob
had
seen
waldo
edgar
chief
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
of
the
department
of
justice
several
times
but
he
had
never
been
introduced
to
him
through
the
exploits
of
the
bureau
in
recent
months
in
tracking
down
some
of
the
nation
s
most
notorious
criminals
edgar
had
become
an
almost
legendary
figure
for
it
was
from
his
office
far
up
in
the
department
of
justice
building
that
he
directed
by
telephone
telegraph
and
radio
the
great
man
hunts
for
the
violators
of
the
law
merritt
hughes
looked
at
bob
s
hands
hurt
your
hands
in
the
fight
last
night
he
asked
nothing
like
that
replied
bob
i
got
tangled
up
in
a
barberry
hedge
a
few
minutes
ago
and
the
thorns
almost
got
the
better
of
me
guess
i
ve
ruined
this
what
under
the
sun
were
you
doing
in
a
barberry
hedge
the
federal
agent
wanted
to
know
trying
to
get
away
from
a
couple
of
who
seemed
to
want
my
company
more
than
i
wanted
no
exclaimed
his
uncle
incredulously
yes
retorted
bob
with
equal
insistence
i
was
taking
a
when
a
sedan
pulled
alongside
me
and
one
fellow
got
out
and
asked
about
an
address
it
was
just
a
stall
to
get
near
me
but
i
had
seen
the
car
parked
earlier
just
opposite
the
apartment
i
was
suspicious
and
when
i
thought
he
got
insistent
i
let
him
have
a
couple
the
driver
started
after
me
and
when
i
thought
he
was
reaching
for
a
gun
i
went
over
the
fence
and
dove
through
the
merritt
hughes
whistled
softly
this
is
serious
have
you
reported
it
yet
to
the
police
no
i
thought
it
was
best
to
come
right
here
and
tell
you
i
didn
t
get
the
number
of
the
car
for
i
was
too
busy
trying
to
crash
through
that
blamed
that
s
not
important
they
ve
either
abandoned
the
car
or
changed
the
license
plates
by
this
time
can
you
describe
the
men
who
were
in
it
bob
supplied
a
detailed
explanation
and
his
uncle
jotted
the
facts
down
on
a
small
card
this
will
give
us
a
lead
to
work
on
later
we
ll
go
over
to
the
bureau
of
identification
and
run
through
some
pictures
of
red
heads
and
men
with
scars
on
their
foreheads
maybe
we
can
pick
up
some
real
clues
bob
was
tempted
to
relate
the
incident
of
the
early
morning
at
his
room
when
someone
had
tried
to
gain
access
but
he
hesitated
to
tell
this
in
front
of
tully
it
sounded
a
little
like
a
fairy
tale
or
the
work
of
an
overwrought
imagination
the
door
to
an
inner
suite
of
offices
opened
and
a
dapper
man
of
about
stepped
into
the
room
behind
him
was
condon
adams
bob
felt
his
pulse
quicken
for
even
before
their
introduction
he
recognized
waldo
edgar
ace
of
all
the
federal
manhunters
and
chief
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
edgar
looked
at
the
handkerchiefs
on
bob
s
hands
and
smiled
quizzically
fighting
no
just
plain
barberry
thorns
replied
bob
then
i
take
it
you
weren
t
strolling
on
the
barberry
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
said
the
federal
chief
well
it
wasn
t
exactly
a
stroll
grinned
bob
it
was
something
like
trying
to
do
a
hundred
yard
dash
in
nothing
flat
through
half
an
acre
of
barberry
it
was
a
good
place
to
hide
but
a
poor
place
for
waldo
edgar
s
eyebrows
went
up
questioningly
and
he
turned
to
merritt
hughes
does
this
tie
in
with
what
happened
last
night
he
asked
apparently
bob
was
trailed
by
a
couple
of
hoodlums
in
a
car
when
he
was
alone
on
a
side
street
they
waylaid
him
but
he
knocked
one
out
and
jumped
over
a
fence
and
ran
through
a
barberry
patch
to
escape
he
came
here
directly
after
that
anything
else
happened
since
last
night
the
question
was
from
the
thin
straight
lips
of
waldo
edgar
and
bob
told
in
detail
what
had
taken
place
during
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
about
this
bob
exclaimed
his
uncle
bob
flushed
well
it
seemed
like
i
d
been
having
enough
excitement
for
the
last
hours
and
this
sounded
sort
of
i
ll
say
it
sounds
crazy
snorted
condon
adams
and
bob
caught
a
supercilious
sneer
flit
across
the
lips
of
tully
ross
it
was
plain
that
neither
adams
nor
his
nephew
believed
the
story
and
bob
turned
back
to
the
federal
chief
there
s
nothing
crazy
about
this
story
it
only
confirms
our
realization
that
some
tremendously
powerful
force
is
after
these
radio
secrets
we
know
now
that
only
a
part
of
the
secret
papers
were
taken
from
the
file
last
night
the
others
had
not
been
sent
over
from
the
radio
engineering
division
of
the
war
but
how
could
those
papers
get
out
of
the
office
last
night
put
in
condon
adams
that
s
for
you
and
hughes
here
to
determine
you
re
on
this
case
but
i
m
going
to
add
a
couple
of
special
agents
to
help
you
out
it
isn
t
that
i
think
you
re
not
capable
but
i
believe
several
inside
men
in
the
archives
division
will
be
tremendously
helpful
to
you
and
i
don
t
want
to
have
outsiders
go
in
waldo
edgar
turned
toward
bob
and
tully
and
looked
at
them
through
searching
eyes
his
scrutiny
of
bob
was
fairly
brief
but
he
appeared
to
be
making
a
more
careful
appraisal
of
tully
and
bob
thought
he
saw
just
a
flicker
of
doubt
in
the
federal
chief
s
eyes
it
is
decidedly
irregular
for
this
division
to
take
on
additional
men
and
especially
very
young
men
but
when
we
feel
a
case
merits
unusual
attention
we
do
not
hesitate
to
cut
away
the
red
tape
and
employ
the
individuals
we
want
to
serve
us
bob
would
you
consider
joining
the
bureau
of
investigation
as
a
provisional
agent
working
directly
out
of
my
office
and
solely
upon
this
radio
case
bob
s
heart
went
into
his
throat
and
he
choked
in
answering
i
d
like
that
very
much
sir
i
ll
do
my
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
tully
how
about
you
great
stuff
count
me
waldo
edgar
nodded
i
thought
you
would
both
agree
wait
just
a
the
federal
chief
left
the
room
and
when
he
returned
he
had
a
bible
in
one
hand
and
several
small
leather
cases
in
another
place
your
left
hands
on
the
bible
and
raise
your
right
hands
he
directed
then
he
read
a
brief
pledge
which
they
repeated
after
him
the
pledge
administered
waldo
edgar
handed
one
of
the
leather
cases
to
tully
and
the
other
to
bob
you
will
find
your
identification
cards
in
there
as
well
as
a
small
gold
badge
further
instructions
will
be
given
you
later
in
the
day
i
m
expecting
a
great
deal
from
each
of
after
shaking
hands
with
each
of
them
he
hurried
away
and
bob
looked
down
at
the
identification
card
in
the
leather
case
he
was
now
bob
houston
special
agent
nine
chapter
xv
a
real
job
ahead
there
was
a
strange
mist
in
bob
s
eyes
as
he
looked
up
at
his
uncle
shake
bob
you
ve
got
a
real
job
ahead
of
you
and
i
know
you
ll
come
through
with
flying
thanks
a
lot
this
is
the
biggest
thing
that
has
ever
come
to
me
and
i
m
going
to
succeed
if
it
is
at
all
there
was
a
grim
sort
of
a
chuckle
from
tully
ross
who
had
shoved
his
leather
case
with
its
card
and
badge
into
an
inside
pocket
you
re
going
to
have
to
step
some
if
you
think
you
can
put
anything
over
on
tully
and
his
uncle
left
the
office
and
bob
watched
the
door
close
behind
them
nice
people
he
grinned
i
don
t
like
the
looks
of
this
case
said
his
uncle
it
isn
t
pleasant
to
think
that
you
ve
got
someone
else
in
the
same
department
who
goes
out
of
his
way
to
make
it
unpleasant
for
you
working
on
the
same
then
why
is
adams
assigned
to
team
up
with
you
asked
bob
perhaps
because
we
have
a
habit
of
getting
results
admitted
merritt
hughes
with
a
rueful
smile
we
ve
been
pretty
lucky
on
a
number
of
cases
where
we
have
worked
together
the
breaks
have
been
about
and
now
we
both
want
a
really
smashing
victory
that
will
bring
us
advancement
it
looks
like
this
may
be
the
case
but
it
s
going
to
be
dangerous
what
do
you
mean
by
that
well
look
back
over
the
events
of
the
last
few
hours
we
know
that
an
important
paper
containing
part
of
a
new
radio
discovery
was
sent
over
to
your
department
from
the
radio
engineering
division
before
it
can
be
properly
filed
a
guard
is
overpowered
and
two
offices
ransacked
to
find
this
paper
later
in
the
night
another
attempt
is
made
to
enter
your
room
and
this
morning
there
was
an
attempt
to
kidnap
you
looks
to
me
like
you
re
in
a
key
position
but
i
don
t
know
just
what
it
is
i
ll
admit
the
attempt
to
get
into
my
room
last
night
and
the
trouble
this
morning
have
me
worried
said
bob
i
m
only
a
filing
clerk
so
why
such
attention
should
be
centered
on
me
is
a
they
walked
out
into
the
corridor
we
ll
stop
at
the
bureau
of
identification
and
see
if
we
can
learn
anything
about
the
fellows
who
tried
to
kidnap
you
said
the
federal
agent
they
dropped
down
a
floor
and
entered
a
long
room
where
a
number
of
clerks
were
working
at
filing
cases
merritt
hughes
walked
up
to
a
slender
chap
busy
at
a
desk
look
alive
jimmy
he
said
there
s
business
at
jimmy
adel
chief
of
the
filing
division
looked
up
hello
sleuth
who
are
you
trailing
this
morning
one
red
head
and
one
fellow
with
a
scar
on
his
now
isn
t
that
a
lot
of
help
don
t
you
know
that
there
are
a
good
many
red
heads
and
a
whole
lot
of
people
with
scars
on
their
foreheads
just
be
a
little
more
exact
but
he
grinned
as
he
chided
the
federal
agent
jimmy
this
is
my
nephew
bob
houston
he
s
detailed
to
help
me
on
a
new
case
that
s
breaking
pretty
the
radio
case
you
hear
about
that
sure
it
s
all
over
the
department
looks
big
to
me
adams
working
on
it
too
merritt
hughes
nodded
that
means
you
ll
have
to
step
fast
i
hear
that
whoever
solves
this
thing
will
be
in
line
for
an
hope
you
re
right
jimmy
because
bob
and
i
are
going
to
clear
up
this
mystery
that
is
if
you
ll
give
us
a
little
help
a
couple
of
hoodlums
tried
to
kidnap
bob
a
while
ago
he
can
give
you
an
accurate
description
of
them
and
you
may
be
able
to
pull
their
pictures
out
of
the
we
ll
find
them
for
you
if
they
ve
any
record
at
he
pulled
a
blank
form
from
a
file
and
fired
question
after
question
at
bob
on
height
weight
color
of
eyes
and
any
possible
peculiarities
which
they
might
have
had
when
he
had
finished
both
forms
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
i
d
call
that
an
almost
perfect
description
of
these
chaps
if
we
don
t
dig
them
out
of
the
files
i
ll
miss
my
bet
we
ll
get
something
for
you
before
midnight
good
bob
and
his
uncle
left
the
identification
bureau
and
took
an
elevator
down
to
the
main
floor
bob
s
hands
still
smarted
from
the
scratches
they
had
suffered
from
the
barberry
and
he
kept
the
handkerchiefs
wrapped
around
them
i
want
to
drop
in
at
the
police
station
and
question
the
man
caught
last
night
said
merritt
hughes
but
we
can
stop
at
your
apartment
on
our
way
down
and
give
it
the
we
might
find
something
of
interest
in
the
the
federal
agent
flagged
a
taxi
and
they
sped
swiftly
toward
bob
s
apartment
well
how
does
it
feel
to
be
a
federal
agent
even
though
you
re
only
a
provisional
one
his
uncle
asked
i
m
not
quite
used
to
it
replied
bob
taking
out
the
small
leather
case
and
extracting
the
card
and
badge
which
it
contained
he
turned
the
badge
over
carefully
in
his
fingers
his
name
was
engraved
on
the
back
and
behind
this
small
emblem
stood
the
mighty
law
enforcement
machinery
of
uncle
sam
bob
thrilled
even
though
he
was
as
yet
a
small
and
comparatively
unimportant
part
of
that
great
system
which
was
rapidly
building
up
a
worldwide
reputation
for
getting
its
merritt
hughes
settled
back
in
the
cushions
this
is
likely
to
be
a
rather
out
case
he
said
and
from
the
way
it
s
started
it
may
be
extremely
dangerous
when
it
comes
to
that
i
want
you
to
step
aside
and
let
the
regular
agents
take
the
chances
do
you
understand
bob
but
i
m
not
afraid
of
trouble
insisted
bob
that
isn
t
it
when
the
pinches
come
we
want
men
who
have
been
tried
under
fire
in
there
you
ll
be
used
as
an
inside
man
in
the
archives
division
and
in
that
capacity
you
are
going
to
be
highly
important
there
must
have
been
a
leak
somewhere
else
how
would
it
have
been
known
that
a
part
of
the
new
radio
development
had
been
sent
over
for
filing
it
will
be
up
to
you
to
find
where
this
information
leaked
before
tully
ross
and
condon
adams
learn
the
federal
agent
paused
a
moment
before
continuing
after
we
find
the
leak
in
your
department
we
ll
have
something
to
work
back
on
that
should
lead
us
to
the
man
or
the
men
who
now
have
the
papers
that
disappeared
last
won
t
the
man
arrested
last
night
be
the
key
to
that
asked
bob
perhaps
but
i
hardly
believe
so
usually
the
boys
who
do
the
rough
stuff
in
a
case
like
this
know
little
of
what
is
really
going
on
but
we
ll
see
him
a
little
later
no
use
in
letting
anything
the
cab
slowed
down
in
front
of
the
apartment
house
and
bob
s
uncle
paid
the
taxi
bill
they
walked
up
to
the
third
floor
and
then
back
along
the
corridor
to
the
door
which
opened
into
bob
s
room
the
door
was
slightly
ajar
and
merritt
hughes
was
about
to
push
it
open
when
bob
seized
his
arm
and
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
then
he
pulled
his
uncle
back
several
steps
that
door
was
locked
when
i
left
he
whispered
someone
s
been
in
my
merritt
hughes
looked
startled
sure
he
whispered
there
s
no
question
about
it
replied
bob
then
keep
back
and
let
me
go
it
was
a
whispered
command
that
bob
dared
not
disobey
and
he
saw
his
uncle
reach
under
his
left
arm
and
draw
a
revolver
from
a
shoulder
holster
they
stepped
close
to
the
wall
and
again
advanced
toward
the
door
treading
silently
on
the
heavy
carpet
of
the
corridor
there
was
no
sound
of
anyone
moving
about
inside
the
room
but
merritt
hughes
did
not
believe
in
taking
unnecessary
chances
after
listening
a
moment
at
the
door
he
reached
out
with
one
foot
and
gave
it
a
hard
shove
inward
at
the
same
time
leaping
into
the
doorway
gun
in
hand
and
ready
for
action
it
was
a
breathless
moment
for
bob
until
he
saw
his
uncle
lower
the
weapon
and
nod
to
him
come
here
and
take
a
look
at
your
chapter
xvi
in
bob
s
room
bob
stepped
through
the
doorway
and
stopped
involuntarily
the
interior
of
his
room
looked
like
a
young
cyclone
had
been
turned
loose
on
a
spring
afternoon
every
drawer
in
the
dresser
had
been
pulled
out
and
its
contents
dumped
on
the
floor
the
bedding
was
strewn
about
the
room
and
the
mattress
had
been
ripped
open
and
even
his
clothes
had
been
taken
out
of
the
closet
and
scattered
about
friends
of
yours
must
have
been
disappointed
because
you
weren
t
at
home
said
his
uncle
bob
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
took
another
look
around
nothing
in
the
room
had
been
spared
even
the
pictures
had
been
taken
off
the
walls
and
the
backs
ripped
out
he
looked
down
at
a
coat
which
had
been
dropped
beside
the
chair
the
pockets
had
been
turned
inside
out
and
the
lining
of
the
garment
had
been
torn
and
ripped
the
coat
was
ruined
and
bob
felt
hot
tears
of
anger
welling
into
his
eyes
his
fists
doubled
up
involuntarily
someone
would
have
to
pay
for
this
he
told
himself
merritt
hughes
touched
his
shoulder
keep
your
chin
up
bob
this
is
kind
of
tough
and
it
looks
plain
malicious
to
me
but
your
time
will
come
i
m
just
wondering
why
all
of
this
attention
is
being
centered
on
you
i
can
t
make
myself
believe
that
they
are
trying
to
get
even
with
you
because
you
spoiled
the
game
last
but
i
didn
t
the
paper
is
yes
it
s
gone
from
the
files
but
they
may
not
have
their
hands
on
it
yet
sure
you
made
a
thorough
search
down
below
the
building
last
night
it
couldn
t
have
been
caught
in
the
shrubbery
i
m
sure
about
that
we
went
over
every
inch
of
space
and
found
half
of
the
gum
wrappers
in
washington
replied
bob
i
wish
i
could
feel
sure
that
the
paper
has
not
gotten
into
the
hands
of
the
men
who
are
after
it
from
what
s
gone
on
today
i
m
inclined
to
believe
there
has
been
a
slip
somewhere
we
know
the
paper
is
missing
from
the
files
but
we
re
not
sure
that
the
man
who
took
it
was
able
to
deliver
it
outside
before
you
caught
i
don
t
think
he
did
his
only
chance
would
have
been
to
have
dropped
it
from
the
window
and
that
would
have
been
too
he
might
have
placed
it
in
a
marked
container
of
some
kind
and
have
had
a
confederate
waiting
below
suggested
the
federal
agent
that
s
possible
but
when
arthur
jacobs
and
i
searched
last
night
we
couldn
t
even
find
fresh
footprints
under
the
windows
of
course
there
were
some
near
the
window
where
the
guard
was
trussed
up
but
if
the
paper
had
been
dropped
in
a
container
there
should
have
been
footprints
directly
the
rain
might
have
erased
i
doubt
it
the
ground
under
the
shrubbery
is
unusually
soft
and
i
noticed
how
deep
our
own
prints
merritt
hughes
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
asked
bob
another
question
what
do
you
think
about
tully
could
he
possibly
have
taken
that
paper
out
of
the
file
not
unless
he
was
a
magician
and
i
don
t
think
tully
would
do
a
thing
like
that
he
s
wild
and
headstrong
but
he
wouldn
t
go
that
far
why
that
s
working
against
uncle
sam
certainly
but
some
people
aren
t
bothered
by
scruples
like
that
well
if
we
re
sure
the
paper
wasn
t
tossed
out
the
window
it
narrows
down
to
three
man
you
caught
tully
and
but
i
wouldn
t
take
that
paper
smiled
bob
of
course
not
i
know
that
and
so
does
waldo
edgar
or
he
wouldn
t
have
made
you
a
provisional
agent
but
condon
adams
is
as
anxious
to
solve
this
case
as
i
am
and
he
may
try
to
hang
something
around
your
neck
remember
that
only
three
of
you
were
in
the
room
and
that
paper
disappeared
in
some
i
hadn
t
thought
of
it
in
that
way
reflected
bob
it
does
put
me
in
a
pretty
serious
that
s
why
i
have
been
so
anxious
that
you
be
assigned
to
work
with
me
on
this
case
i
had
a
long
talk
with
edgar
this
morning
i
d
told
him
of
your
ambition
to
eventually
join
the
service
and
pointed
out
that
you
might
well
prove
invaluable
as
an
inside
man
on
this
case
he
agreed
with
me
and
of
course
when
condon
adams
put
up
about
the
same
kind
of
a
proposition
in
behalf
of
tully
he
couldn
t
say
i
d
like
to
know
where
adams
gets
all
his
pull
said
bob
part
of
it
is
due
to
ability
and
part
of
it
to
powerful
political
friends
explained
his
uncle
the
senator
from
adams
home
state
is
high
up
in
administration
circles
and
in
addition
is
a
firm
friend
of
this
department
he
s
helped
get
us
the
additional
appropriations
we
ve
needed
to
expand
and
equip
the
department
properly
and
of
course
the
chief
can
t
ignore
that
when
adams
puts
the
pressure
i
suppose
not
admitted
bob
but
it
seems
unfair
to
the
other
men
who
have
no
political
his
is
about
the
only
case
in
the
department
in
which
that
is
true
said
his
uncle
but
he
s
competent
too
don
t
mistake
that
i
ll
have
to
keep
on
my
toes
if
i
run
this
radio
mystery
down
before
he
all
of
which
means
that
i
am
the
inside
man
for
you
while
tully
is
to
serve
his
uncle
in
whatever
inside
capacity
he
can
in
our
department
said
bob
i
can
see
where
there
is
going
to
be
some
intense
well
either
adams
or
myself
should
benefit
by
it
smiled
the
federal
agent
only
don
t
kill
each
other
trying
to
dig
out
facts
and
get
them
to
us
first
now
we
d
better
find
out
what
we
can
about
the
invasion
here
how
about
your
landlords
they
re
down
in
virginia
on
a
vacation
the
only
person
likely
to
know
anything
about
this
is
the
janitor
explained
bob
take
me
down
to
him
directed
his
uncle
bob
looked
ruefully
at
the
room
there
wasn
t
a
whole
lot
that
could
be
salvaged
for
his
clothing
was
ruined
and
one
of
the
suits
had
been
practically
new
he
could
see
his
savings
account
going
down
almost
to
the
vanishing
point
they
stepped
out
into
the
hall
and
bob
started
to
lock
the
door
wait
a
minute
i
want
a
look
at
that
doorknob
said
his
uncle
he
took
a
small
but
powerful
glass
from
his
coat
pocket
and
examined
the
doorknob
when
he
stood
up
he
shook
his
head
whoever
opened
that
door
was
wearing
gloves
that
means
if
they
were
that
smart
there
isn
t
much
use
to
check
over
the
interior
of
the
rooms
for
any
sign
of
the
door
being
forced
asked
bob
no
a
skeleton
key
must
have
been
used
lead
on
we
ll
see
the
janitor
they
found
the
janitor
in
the
basement
and
when
bob
explained
their
mission
he
readily
assented
to
answer
their
questions
strangers
he
said
repeating
the
question
the
federal
agent
asked
yes
a
couple
of
them
called
about
an
hour
ago
they
wanted
to
know
where
houston
lived
and
i
took
them
up
to
the
third
floor
back
they
said
they
had
been
sent
to
get
some
papers
he
had
left
at
how
did
they
get
in
the
question
shot
from
the
lips
of
the
federal
agent
why
they
had
a
key
explained
the
janitor
one
of
them
said
houston
had
given
them
his
key
it
worked
all
right
and
i
didn
t
think
any
more
about
it
i
was
having
trouble
with
the
furnace
smoking
so
i
came
right
back
down
and
left
them
alone
in
bob
s
room
the
agent
pressed
that
s
right
they
seemed
to
know
what
they
were
how
long
did
they
stay
up
there
i
don
t
rightly
know
i
went
up
to
that
floor
a
few
minutes
ago
but
no
one
was
in
sight
then
maybe
they
were
there
half
an
hour
maybe
only
five
what
did
they
look
like
the
janitor
scratched
his
head
well
now
i
didn
t
pay
a
whole
lot
of
attention
to
them
one
of
them
was
a
lot
taller
than
the
other
one
a
premonition
had
been
growing
on
bob
and
he
couldn
t
repress
his
question
did
the
taller
one
have
red
hair
he
asked
come
to
think
of
it
he
did
replied
the
janitor
and
the
shorter
one
was
there
a
scar
on
his
forehead
that
s
right
friends
of
yours
of
course
well
not
exactly
friends
said
bob
remember
anything
else
about
them
asked
merritt
hughes
not
right
now
anyhow
said
the
janitor
and
they
left
him
to
return
to
his
work
while
they
went
outdoors
merritt
hughes
was
the
first
to
speak
i
guess
there
is
no
question
about
the
identity
of
your
visitors
they
are
the
same
ones
who
attempted
to
kidnap
you
what
s
the
reason
for
all
of
your
popularity
bob
shook
his
head
i
only
wish
i
knew
he
said
believe
me
it
is
no
fun
to
have
your
room
torn
apart
like
that
why
they
ruined
my
clothes
and
it
s
going
to
be
mighty
costly
getting
them
i
ll
help
you
out
if
you
re
pinched
for
money
volunteered
his
uncle
reaching
for
his
billfold
but
bob
waved
the
offer
aside
thanks
but
i
ll
get
along
all
right
if
i
ever
catch
up
with
those
fellows
they
ll
have
to
get
their
fists
into
action
pretty
fast
if
they
want
to
escape
a
thorough
i
don
t
blame
you
a
bit
for
feeling
that
way
but
we
ve
got
to
get
along
i
have
an
appointment
with
one
of
the
army
s
chief
radio
engineers
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
and
i
want
you
to
sit
they
signalled
for
a
cab
and
started
for
the
meeting
which
was
to
reveal
some
startling
information
on
bob
s
first
case
chapter
xvii
the
radio
secret
merritt
hughes
leaned
back
in
the
seat
as
the
cab
darted
in
and
out
of
the
heavy
traffic
on
the
avenue
all
of
the
breaks
have
been
against
us
so
far
he
mused
half
to
himself
and
half
to
bob
but
we
re
bound
to
find
something
coming
our
way
i
m
anxious
to
see
the
fellow
who
is
being
held
at
the
police
station
said
bob
surely
you
ll
be
able
to
get
some
information
out
of
remember
you
re
working
on
this
case
too
better
say
we
instead
of
you
when
you
re
talking
about
it
this
is
the
firm
of
hughes
and
houston
working
for
uncle
sam
on
a
radio
their
cab
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
war
department
and
they
entered
and
hastened
to
an
upper
floor
where
the
federal
agent
rapped
sharply
on
a
door
marked
major
francis
mccreary
come
in
a
heavy
voice
on
the
other
side
rumbled
and
merritt
hughes
opened
the
door
bob
looking
in
saw
a
heavy
man
a
huge
thatch
of
hair
bristling
over
his
forehead
at
a
desk
he
rose
as
they
entered
hello
hughes
greeted
the
major
right
on
he
nodded
toward
a
desk
clock
made
it
with
nothing
to
spare
grinned
bob
s
uncle
then
he
added
major
i
want
you
to
know
my
nephew
bob
houston
he
s
working
with
me
on
this
case
bob
s
the
man
who
captured
our
radio
thief
last
night
and
i
m
counting
on
him
as
a
valuable
inside
man
in
the
department
over
glad
to
meet
you
boomed
the
major
offering
a
warm
handclasp
are
you
in
the
department
of
justice
bob
started
to
reply
but
his
uncle
spoke
first
he
s
in
the
filing
division
right
now
but
he
s
also
a
provisional
agent
and
i
m
expecting
he
ll
join
the
service
the
major
shuffled
several
papers
on
his
desk
and
picked
up
one
here
s
a
copy
of
the
paper
stolen
last
night
he
said
i
know
you
want
the
gist
of
its
importance
and
why
so
much
interest
attaches
to
he
waved
them
toward
chairs
and
dropped
back
in
his
own
swivel
seat
which
he
filled
to
overflowing
with
his
generous
bulk
we
ve
been
making
some
real
strides
in
our
army
radio
development
he
went
on
and
some
other
powers
have
been
watching
us
closely
there
s
no
need
to
mention
names
right
now
until
suspicion
definitely
points
to
a
nation
what
we
have
actually
perfected
in
recent
weeks
is
a
workable
radio
control
for
robot
operated
bombing
he
paused
a
moment
to
let
the
significance
of
his
statement
sink
in
bob
knew
its
importance
of
course
there
had
long
been
talk
that
such
a
device
was
possible
but
it
had
never
been
perfected
so
far
as
he
knew
its
value
as
a
weapon
of
destruction
was
tremendous
for
airplanes
loaded
with
high
explosives
could
be
dispatched
over
great
distances
and
then
made
to
drop
their
deadly
cargoes
upon
a
radio
signal
bob
glanced
at
his
uncle
merritt
hughes
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
waiting
for
the
army
officer
to
continue
major
mccreary
cleared
his
throat
and
bob
sensed
that
he
was
laboring
under
a
definite
strain
this
project
has
been
a
pet
of
mine
for
years
i
ve
encountered
one
discouragement
after
another
and
it
was
only
two
months
ago
that
i
struck
the
right
track
since
then
my
developments
have
been
almost
he
paused
a
moment
as
though
fearing
they
might
feel
he
was
bragging
about
his
own
accomplishments
actual
tests
last
week
proved
the
practicability
of
my
invention
and
i
then
set
it
down
in
detail
for
final
filing
of
course
we
knew
that
other
powers
were
aware
of
the
line
along
which
the
experiments
had
been
carried
out
but
our
real
source
of
worry
was
that
they
might
get
their
hands
on
the
actual
details
of
operation
for
that
reason
it
was
decided
to
file
the
material
in
various
sections
and
to
make
no
special
fuss
about
and
the
paper
stolen
last
night
was
the
first
section
of
your
file
asked
merritt
hughes
restraining
his
eagerness
no
longer
the
army
officer
nodded
right
it
was
the
original
the
one
on
my
desk
is
a
copy
the
other
originals
are
in
a
safe
in
this
is
there
enough
information
on
the
first
section
which
was
stolen
to
reveal
your
plan
in
full
asked
bob
that
s
something
that
would
depend
upon
the
cleverness
of
the
men
into
whose
hands
it
is
delivered
there
is
one
european
power
whose
radio
experts
are
well
advanced
along
the
line
on
which
i
have
been
working
if
this
document
is
delivered
into
their
hands
there
is
a
good
chance
that
it
contains
information
which
would
be
of
value
to
but
so
far
we
have
no
idea
who
is
behind
the
theft
last
night
said
the
federal
agent
have
you
any
hunches
major
mccreary
shook
his
head
nothing
strong
enough
to
give
you
any
leads
but
i
ll
let
you
know
the
minute
anything
develops
in
the
meantime
make
every
effort
to
recover
this
paper
once
it
passes
beyond
the
boundaries
of
this
country
it
may
fall
into
the
hands
of
men
smart
enough
and
unscrupulous
enough
to
learn
its
meaning
and
put
it
to
their
own
selfish
use
it
is
a
secret
which
would
give
them
unlimited
powers
of
after
they
had
left
major
mccreary
s
office
bob
looked
at
his
uncle
what
next
he
asked
to
the
police
station
to
interview
that
prisoner
without
any
further
loss
of
time
was
the
decision
the
station
was
some
distance
away
and
they
took
a
taxi
before
they
had
gone
three
blocks
the
hooting
of
police
sirens
fairly
filled
the
air
and
their
driver
was
forced
to
pull
far
over
to
the
right
as
radio
cars
went
racing
past
each
driver
tense
at
his
wheel
and
the
other
officer
ready
with
a
shotgun
in
his
lap
something
big
s
broken
said
the
federal
agent
be
just
my
luck
to
have
it
an
angle
on
this
case
oh
well
we
might
as
well
go
on
to
the
station
and
see
what
we
can
dig
out
of
your
as
they
reached
the
police
station
another
squad
car
rushed
away
its
siren
screaming
a
warning
to
traffic
merritt
hughes
fairly
tossed
the
cab
fare
at
the
driver
and
with
bob
at
his
heels
ran
into
the
building
the
federal
agent
knew
the
desk
sergeant
and
directed
his
questions
at
him
what
s
up
barney
bank
been
robbed
just
about
as
bad
someone
slugged
one
of
your
agents
and
made
a
break
matter
of
fact
i
guess
it
was
a
friend
of
quit
kidding
barney
what
happened
the
fellow
you
caught
last
night
was
being
questioned
by
condon
adams
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
ups
and
smashes
adams
a
nasty
crack
on
the
chin
grabs
his
gun
and
legs
it
out
the
door
we
ve
got
every
squad
car
in
town
out
hunting
for
bob
felt
his
own
heart
sink
for
he
knew
that
unless
the
fugitive
was
recaptured
their
hopes
for
a
real
break
in
the
radio
mystery
were
slim
chapter
xviii
meager
hopes
merritt
hughes
stared
hard
at
the
police
sergeant
as
though
he
dared
not
believe
the
officer
s
words
say
that
again
barney
there
must
be
some
there
was
grinned
the
sergeant
condon
adams
made
a
mistake
in
questioning
that
fellow
alone
things
certainly
happened
fast
and
furiously
around
the
federal
agent
shook
his
head
we
re
certainly
not
getting
the
breaks
in
this
case
he
growled
where
s
adams
he
s
out
with
one
of
the
radio
have
any
idea
where
this
fellow
went
when
he
made
his
break
from
the
station
here
he
forced
a
passing
motorist
to
pick
him
up
but
we
didn
t
even
get
a
good
description
of
the
car
oh
it
was
a
smooth
merritt
hughes
turned
to
his
nephew
and
bob
saw
an
expression
of
almost
despair
in
his
face
then
it
was
gone
in
a
moment
and
in
its
place
was
a
set
look
of
determination
which
bob
had
often
seen
when
his
uncle
was
working
on
a
big
case
anything
i
can
do
to
help
you
here
the
federal
agent
asked
the
desk
sergeant
not
a
thing
unless
this
fellow
comes
back
and
tries
to
steal
the
then
we
ll
go
along
to
the
hospital
and
have
a
talk
with
the
guard
who
was
attacked
last
as
they
left
the
police
station
they
could
hear
the
echo
of
the
sirens
in
the
distance
think
he
ll
get
away
asked
bob
who
had
spoken
only
once
or
twice
during
the
entire
time
they
had
been
in
the
station
i
m
afraid
so
especially
since
the
police
have
no
description
of
the
car
he
commandeered
replied
merritt
hughes
when
they
reached
the
hospital
they
were
shown
immediately
to
the
room
where
the
guard
was
a
patient
he
was
a
man
his
dark
hair
streaked
with
grey
and
there
was
a
bandage
around
his
forehead
where
he
had
received
a
particularly
painful
blow
from
his
assailant
can
he
be
interviewed
the
federal
agent
asked
the
nurse
on
duty
in
the
room
if
he
doesn
t
talk
too
long
she
replied
bob
glimpsed
the
chart
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
learned
that
the
guard
s
name
was
max
chervinka
and
that
he
was
years
old
merritt
hughes
sat
down
beside
the
bed
while
bob
behind
him
leaned
against
the
wall
i
ll
ask
all
the
questions
the
federal
agent
told
the
guard
don
t
talk
unless
you
have
to
just
nod
a
little
in
answer
and
that
will
do
understand
the
guard
smiled
and
nodded
had
you
noticed
anything
suspicious
about
the
building
recently
the
answer
was
negative
then
the
federal
agent
plunged
into
his
questions
how
had
the
attack
taken
place
what
did
the
man
look
like
was
there
more
than
one
had
he
seen
anything
of
a
paper
which
might
have
been
tossed
from
an
upper
window
the
answers
were
definite
the
guard
could
not
describe
his
assailant
as
far
as
he
knew
there
had
been
only
one
man
and
he
had
not
seen
anything
of
a
paper
thrown
from
a
window
have
you
ever
been
offered
anything
to
let
anyone
in
the
building
who
had
no
business
there
the
federal
agent
rapped
out
this
question
sharply
and
bob
knew
that
his
uncle
attached
great
importance
to
the
answer
never
the
guard
s
reply
though
in
a
weak
voice
was
definite
there
was
never
any
trouble
until
last
night
he
added
the
nurse
the
room
noticed
the
bright
eyes
and
the
flushed
cheeks
of
her
patient
and
spoke
to
the
federal
agents
i
think
he
s
had
all
of
the
exertion
he
can
stand
for
a
while
she
said
later
perhaps
this
evening
you
might
call
again
if
you
has
anyone
else
been
here
asked
merritt
hughes
not
then
don
t
allow
anyone
to
see
him
unless
he
can
identify
himself
as
a
department
of
justice
agent
he
instructed
when
they
were
down
on
the
main
floor
bob
spoke
why
did
you
instruct
the
nurse
like
that
just
playing
safe
we
know
that
the
guard
didn
t
see
enough
of
his
assailant
to
identify
him
but
other
members
of
that
gang
don
t
know
that
there
is
no
use
in
exposing
that
fellow
to
any
unnecessary
when
they
were
outside
once
more
bob
voiced
another
question
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
now
better
go
down
to
your
own
office
and
step
back
into
the
routine
but
keep
your
eyes
open
listen
to
everything
that
is
going
on
but
don
t
let
anyone
get
anything
out
of
you
phone
me
before
you
leave
this
afternoon
to
go
home
i
don
t
want
you
gallivanting
around
this
town
all
alone
the
next
time
some
of
your
friends
may
come
along
and
there
may
not
be
a
fence
and
a
thicket
of
barberry
i
ll
take
a
taxi
home
you
won
t
need
to
come
for
me
protested
bob
you
re
not
going
to
take
a
taxi
home
and
you
re
not
going
home
until
this
thing
is
cleared
up
you
re
going
to
stay
with
me
then
if
anyone
decides
to
pay
us
a
visit
in
the
middle
of
the
night
we
ll
give
them
a
let
me
know
if
anything
big
breaks
urged
bob
and
his
uncle
promised
to
do
this
after
their
parting
bob
walked
down
the
street
alone
a
police
car
sped
by
but
its
siren
was
not
sounding
an
alarm
and
bob
wondered
if
the
rush
of
the
first
chase
for
the
escaped
prisoner
was
over
as
he
hurried
toward
the
archives
building
he
pondered
the
events
of
the
last
hours
it
seemed
almost
incredible
that
so
much
could
have
happened
that
he
could
have
been
involved
in
so
many
different
and
exciting
things
and
now
he
was
a
federal
agent
true
he
was
only
on
provisional
duty
but
if
he
made
good
there
was
an
excellent
chance
that
he
would
become
a
permanent
member
of
the
great
organization
his
uncle
had
been
far
the
breaks
had
all
been
against
them
and
now
the
one
man
on
whom
they
had
been
counting
for
information
had
slipped
away
but
bob
couldn
t
help
a
grin
as
he
thought
of
the
chagrin
which
condon
adams
must
be
suffering
now
it
would
be
hard
to
explain
that
escape
from
the
very
heart
of
a
police
station
bob
turned
into
the
building
where
his
own
office
was
located
and
took
the
elevator
to
the
top
floor
when
he
entered
the
office
he
almost
bumped
into
arthur
jacobs
the
filing
chief
any
news
asked
jacobs
anxiously
and
bob
shook
his
head
what
about
the
prisoner
captured
last
night
don
t
you
know
asked
bob
know
what
demanded
the
filing
chief
he
just
escaped
from
the
police
then
we
re
sunk
groaned
the
filing
chief
that
means
that
paper
is
gone
for
good
and
i
ll
bet
my
job
is
oh
i
wouldn
t
say
that
give
the
federal
men
a
but
they
ve
had
nearly
hours
wailed
the
chubby
jacobs
you
can
t
expect
them
to
do
miracles
in
that
length
of
time
cautioned
bob
before
the
filing
chief
could
reply
the
door
swung
inward
and
tully
ross
hurried
in
his
face
was
flushed
and
he
appeared
to
be
laboring
under
some
great
excitement
arthur
jacobs
looked
at
his
watch
you
might
just
as
well
have
taken
the
whole
day
off
he
snapped
well
maybe
i
will
retorted
tully
i
guess
that
s
about
enough
from
you
said
the
filing
chief
i
ll
find
plenty
of
extra
work
for
you
to
do
and
you
may
change
your
attitude
and
show
a
little
a
dark
wave
of
color
swept
over
tully
s
face
and
bob
saw
his
fists
clench
he
stepped
closer
to
jacobs
i
ll
get
here
just
when
i
please
he
stormed
and
don
t
think
i
m
going
to
let
you
boss
me
around
i
m
a
federal
agent
now
and
i
m
working
on
a
big
case
don
t
you
forget
but
in
spite
of
the
bravado
arthur
jacobs
stood
his
ground
i
don
t
care
what
you
are
he
replied
as
far
as
i
know
you
re
nothing
but
a
clerk
in
my
department
and
you
ll
get
to
work
on
time
and
you
ll
be
respectful
or
you
ll
get
another
if
you
don
t
believe
i
m
a
federal
agent
ask
bob
he
ll
tell
the
filing
chief
turned
to
bob
tully
is
right
i
saw
him
sworn
into
the
service
today
said
bob
he
was
glad
that
jacobs
had
not
asked
him
about
his
own
position
tully
seemed
satisfied
and
his
anger
subsided
when
jacobs
once
more
told
him
to
go
to
his
desk
and
start
work
bob
glanced
at
the
other
clerks
in
the
room
all
of
them
had
been
covertly
watching
the
entire
proceedings
bob
felt
that
they
were
all
trustworthy
but
he
felt
better
in
knowing
that
they
were
not
aware
that
he
was
a
federal
agent
such
knowledge
might
have
spoiled
any
later
efforts
of
his
to
gain
information
from
them
chapter
xix
the
missing
paper
the
affairs
of
the
filing
office
gradually
returned
to
routine
with
bob
and
tully
once
more
at
their
desks
there
was
a
tremendous
amount
of
work
to
be
done
for
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
papers
had
been
removed
from
their
usual
places
in
the
mêlée
of
the
night
before
bob
realized
that
it
would
take
days
for
them
all
to
be
restored
to
their
places
and
he
rather
hoped
as
he
contemplated
the
long
and
tedious
task
that
his
uncle
would
have
work
for
him
to
do
that
would
take
him
outside
the
office
as
the
afternoon
waned
bob
tried
to
analyze
the
character
of
the
other
clerks
in
the
office
he
had
known
them
casually
for
more
than
a
year
now
but
until
this
time
he
had
never
really
tried
to
probe
into
their
inner
characters
it
was
a
task
that
he
was
particularly
well
fitted
to
do
for
he
had
a
rare
gift
of
discernment
of
character
and
anything
untrue
in
another
usually
sounded
an
alarm
bell
in
bob
s
mind
one
by
one
he
checked
them
off
his
list
of
possible
suspects
in
connection
with
the
disappearance
of
the
radio
paper
could
one
of
them
have
tipped
off
anyone
outside
it
was
an
unpleasant
possibility
but
bob
knew
that
in
his
new
work
he
would
be
up
against
many
unpleasant
things
the
list
narrowed
down
until
bob
s
eyes
rested
on
tully
s
broad
shoulders
the
other
was
hunched
over
his
desk
apparently
gazing
through
a
nearby
window
and
certainly
not
much
concerned
with
the
work
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
was
tully
linked
up
with
the
mystery
could
he
have
been
the
one
inside
who
had
learned
of
the
arrival
of
the
precious
paper
and
given
the
information
to
someone
outside
bob
didn
t
want
to
believe
that
yet
he
had
checked
all
of
the
others
off
his
list
his
eyes
rested
on
arthur
jacobs
the
filing
chief
could
it
have
been
jacobs
it
was
possible
but
bob
scouted
serious
consideration
of
the
thought
for
jacobs
heart
was
too
much
in
his
work
and
his
pride
was
too
great
for
such
a
deed
bob
felt
up
against
a
blank
wall
it
was
his
job
to
sit
tight
in
the
office
on
the
supposition
that
someone
inside
must
have
given
out
information
he
felt
now
that
there
was
little
chance
that
this
had
been
the
case
there
were
plenty
of
other
loopholes
for
the
information
to
leak
out
and
bob
was
convinced
that
it
must
have
leaked
before
the
paper
came
into
the
filing
office
at
five
o
clock
the
other
clerks
left
their
desks
but
tully
bob
and
the
filing
chief
lingered
in
the
office
jacobs
spoke
to
tully
i
don
t
care
what
you
re
doing
outside
this
office
he
said
but
as
long
as
you
re
here
and
at
your
desk
you
ll
have
to
work
i
don
t
believe
you
did
five
minutes
work
this
tully
s
eyes
dropped
and
he
studied
the
toes
of
his
shoes
his
voice
was
heavy
when
he
spoke
i
know
i
didn
t
get
much
work
done
he
said
but
i
was
so
blamed
excited
over
being
a
federal
agent
and
then
trying
to
figure
out
how
this
information
could
have
leaked
out
i
ll
be
back
to
earth
again
i
m
glad
of
that
for
we
need
your
help
in
getting
this
mess
straightened
tully
nodded
and
went
on
while
bob
hesitated
i
wanted
just
a
word
with
you
alone
he
told
the
filing
chief
i
didn
t
say
anything
earlier
but
i
m
also
working
on
this
case
as
a
provisional
federal
agent
that
means
i
m
on
probation
if
i
make
good
on
this
case
there
may
be
a
permanent
job
waiting
for
i
rather
thought
you
might
be
smiled
jacobs
after
tully
blurted
out
that
he
was
a
special
agent
i
kind
of
put
two
and
two
together
and
it
looked
like
it
would
be
mighty
strange
if
tully
were
selected
and
not
it
may
be
necessary
for
me
to
be
away
from
the
office
at
various
times
went
on
bob
but
if
i
can
t
get
word
to
you
my
uncle
will
see
that
you
are
anything
that
really
looks
like
a
clue
turned
up
asked
jacobs
bob
shook
his
head
not
as
far
as
i
know
and
i
guess
if
there
had
been
i
wouldn
t
be
at
liberty
to
tell
jacobs
put
on
his
coat
coming
down
tonight
i
ve
some
routine
i
can
get
out
of
the
way
replied
bob
i
ll
have
lunch
nearby
and
will
be
able
to
get
through
in
a
couple
of
i
should
come
back
but
i
m
all
in
don
t
work
too
the
filing
chief
stepped
out
of
the
office
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
bob
was
left
alone
in
the
long
office
the
room
was
in
heavy
shadows
already
for
the
day
had
been
cloudy
and
twilight
had
come
early
he
turned
on
the
light
over
his
desk
decided
that
he
was
hungry
snapped
it
off
put
on
his
coat
and
left
the
office
at
the
door
he
turned
and
made
sure
that
the
room
was
securely
locked
then
he
walked
rapidly
down
the
corridor
turned
and
signalled
for
an
elevator
bob
was
walking
through
the
main
doors
when
someone
hailed
him
and
he
saw
his
uncle
going
to
eat
asked
merritt
hughes
just
about
half
a
ton
of
food
grinned
bob
it
seems
ages
since
i
had
anything
yet
it
was
only
a
few
hours
charge
that
up
to
excitement
replied
his
uncle
as
they
strode
along
together
any
news
of
the
man
who
broke
out
of
the
police
station
there
was
a
real
note
of
anxiety
in
bob
s
voice
not
a
word
he
must
have
been
a
magician
the
police
are
still
combing
the
city
but
i
doubt
if
they
ll
find
him
he
belongs
to
too
clever
a
but
where
could
he
hide
so
securely
in
washington
an
embassy
possibly
shrugged
the
federal
agent
bob
s
eyes
widened
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
a
representative
of
a
foreign
government
would
give
shelter
to
a
criminal
yet
he
knew
that
any
one
of
half
a
dozen
foreign
powers
would
give
a
great
deal
to
possess
the
new
radio
secrets
don
t
take
that
suggestion
too
seriously
warned
merritt
hughes
who
guessed
the
trend
of
bob
s
thoughts
he
leaned
closer
to
bob
this
case
is
causing
all
kinds
of
trouble
the
entire
war
department
is
in
a
furore
and
i
hear
special
intelligence
officers
are
being
assigned
to
see
if
they
can
t
ferret
it
does
that
mean
they
don
t
think
the
justice
department
capable
of
solving
the
mystery
asked
bob
not
exactly
that
i
guess
it
simply
means
that
this
case
is
of
such
tremendous
importance
that
everything
the
government
can
do
will
be
done
in
its
they
turned
into
a
quiet
restaurant
and
selected
a
table
well
to
the
rear
where
they
could
talk
without
danger
of
being
overheard
for
there
were
only
a
few
diners
in
the
place
have
you
seen
condon
adams
asked
bob
the
federal
agent
shook
his
head
i
hear
he
s
having
a
pretty
hard
time
of
it
the
chief
had
him
in
on
the
carpet
and
gave
him
a
going
over
for
letting
this
fellow
slip
away
from
him
but
it
could
have
happened
to
anyone
if
we
d
gotten
there
first
instead
of
adams
we
might
have
been
the
they
ordered
their
dinners
and
bob
leaned
across
the
table
i
ve
been
trying
to
figure
out
everyone
in
the
office
he
said
and
i
can
t
find
a
single
one
on
whom
you
can
pin
any
suspicion
the
leak
about
that
paper
must
have
come
from
outside
before
the
paper
reached
that
s
possible
nodded
his
uncle
remember
that
another
office
was
rifled
before
our
own
was
visited
said
bob
that
should
indicate
that
the
marauder
had
none
too
clear
information
on
where
to
look
for
the
now
you
ve
hit
a
point
i
ve
been
considering
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
convinced
i
become
that
the
leak
came
before
the
paper
reached
your
filing
room
that
means
our
job
will
be
complicated
maybe
we
ll
get
a
break
one
of
these
dinner
was
served
and
they
ate
heartily
ignoring
for
the
time
the
case
that
had
enfolded
both
of
them
in
its
mysterious
tangle
the
dinner
at
an
end
bob
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
shoved
his
hands
in
his
coat
pockets
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
crinkled
a
stiff
sheet
of
paper
and
he
drew
it
out
and
placed
it
on
the
table
it
was
not
an
unusual
sheet
at
first
glance
being
about
eight
inches
wide
and
eleven
inches
long
but
it
was
of
heavy
material
probably
a
pure
rag
paper
but
it
was
not
the
paper
that
caught
and
held
bob
s
attention
it
was
the
crest
of
the
war
department
which
was
centered
at
the
top
of
the
page
merritt
hughes
saw
bob
staring
at
the
paper
and
looked
at
his
nephew
curiously
what
s
the
matter
bob
forget
to
file
something
this
afternoon
when
bob
did
not
answer
at
once
he
reached
over
and
picked
up
the
paper
it
was
his
turn
to
stare
at
the
sheet
and
his
eyes
widened
as
he
looked
up
at
his
nephew
great
heavens
bob
where
did
this
come
from
bob
shook
his
head
i
haven
t
any
idea
i
put
my
hands
in
my
pockets
just
now
and
the
paper
was
in
the
right
hand
but
you
know
what
this
is
bob
nodded
yes
i
know
it
s
the
missing
paper
with
the
radio
chapter
xx
on
a
lonely
street
uncle
and
nephew
stared
at
each
other
across
the
litter
of
dishes
and
for
a
moment
neither
was
able
to
speak
bob
bob
how
did
you
get
mixed
up
in
this
thing
what
have
you
done
there
was
anxiety
and
agony
in
every
word
that
came
from
the
lips
of
the
federal
agent
bob
s
eyes
widened
but
surely
you
don
t
think
i
took
this
i
couldn
t
have
done
his
uncle
waved
his
hands
impatiently
no
no
bob
of
course
that
wasn
t
what
i
meant
i
spoke
hastily
you
re
clean
enough
in
this
thing
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
did
that
paper
get
into
your
coat
pocket
and
how
long
has
it
been
i
only
wish
i
knew
retorted
bob
the
color
surging
back
into
his
cheeks
he
stared
steadily
at
the
paper
on
the
table
before
him
it
was
incredible
that
it
could
have
been
in
his
coat
pocket
all
during
the
long
hours
of
the
frantic
search
for
it
yet
it
must
have
been
for
there
had
been
no
opportunity
for
anyone
to
slip
it
into
his
coat
recently
i
think
the
discovery
of
the
paper
in
your
pocket
explains
the
mysterious
attacks
which
have
been
aimed
at
you
said
his
uncle
slowly
certainly
it
was
the
reason
for
the
rifling
of
your
room
and
the
attempt
to
kidnap
you
this
morning
what
a
i
was
not
to
have
guessed
something
like
this
before
it
s
as
plain
as
day
i
wish
i
could
see
it
that
way
replied
bob
shaking
his
head
the
paper
has
been
in
your
pocket
ever
since
you
encountered
that
marauder
in
the
office
last
night
during
the
tussle
he
slipped
it
into
your
coat
pocket
when
he
realized
that
his
capture
was
that
sounds
plausible
agreed
bob
why
didn
t
i
search
my
own
clothes
because
that
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
we
would
have
surmised
that
paper
had
been
hidden
what
chumps
we
have
the
federal
agent
look
gloomy
well
i
guess
we
might
as
well
get
going
we
ll
report
this
directly
to
the
chief
and
see
what
he
has
to
say
about
will
he
be
on
the
job
during
the
evening
when
a
case
like
this
breaks
he
practically
lives
in
his
office
he
ll
be
there
all
they
left
the
restaurant
secured
a
taxi
and
drove
rapidly
toward
the
department
of
justice
building
bob
catching
the
reflection
of
lights
behind
them
in
the
mirror
at
the
front
looked
back
someone
s
following
us
he
said
the
federal
agent
turned
quickly
there
was
no
mistake
a
car
several
hundred
feet
to
the
rear
was
making
every
turn
their
own
machine
took
merritt
hughes
leaned
ahead
and
spoke
to
the
driver
we
re
being
trailed
step
on
it
i
ll
take
care
of
any
officers
who
try
to
stop
nothing
doin
mister
i
m
not
getting
myself
into
trouble
we
re
stopping
right
the
driver
slammed
on
the
brakes
and
swung
his
car
toward
the
curb
but
a
curt
command
from
bob
s
uncle
stopped
him
get
this
car
under
way
i
m
a
federal
agent
and
i
m
in
no
mood
to
have
you
playing
any
tricks
wheel
this
buggy
for
the
department
of
justice
building
and
make
it
at
the
same
time
he
thrust
the
little
emblem
of
his
office
under
the
driver
s
nose
the
motor
of
the
taxi
roared
as
the
driver
tramped
on
the
accelerator
and
their
vehicle
leaped
ahead
widening
the
distance
between
the
car
which
was
trailing
them
they
took
a
corner
so
fast
the
tires
screeched
in
protest
and
bob
wondered
whether
the
other
machine
would
be
able
to
make
the
turn
looking
back
he
saw
the
car
swing
wildly
veer
toward
the
far
side
of
the
street
and
finally
straighten
out
in
pursuit
of
them
you
seem
to
spell
trouble
with
capital
letters
said
the
federal
agent
as
he
joined
bob
in
peering
out
the
window
maybe
you
d
better
give
me
that
paper
they
know
you
ve
got
it
and
if
we
get
in
a
jam
they
ll
try
and
get
it
away
from
bob
handed
over
the
paper
and
his
uncle
slipped
it
into
a
small
leather
portfolio
which
he
carried
in
an
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
the
taxi
swung
wildly
around
another
corner
and
the
brakes
screeched
as
a
string
of
red
lights
barred
their
way
the
street
was
undergoing
repairs
the
driver
of
their
vehicle
jammed
on
his
brakes
just
as
the
pursuing
machine
lurched
around
the
corner
keep
on
going
cried
bob
s
uncle
grabbing
the
driver
by
the
shoulder
and
shaking
him
roughly
keep
on
it
was
a
command
the
driver
dared
not
disobey
and
their
car
leaped
ahead
once
more
aimed
straight
at
the
first
of
the
red
lights
their
headlights
revealed
a
wooden
barrier
but
there
was
no
stopping
now
and
the
taxi
crashed
into
the
stringers
several
red
lights
were
bowled
over
as
the
barrier
went
down
then
they
were
bouncing
along
over
the
uneven
paving
the
wheels
dropping
into
deep
ruts
bob
turned
and
looked
behind
them
the
pursuing
car
had
stopped
at
the
barrier
and
he
could
see
men
leaping
out
it
was
evident
that
they
intended
to
pursue
the
chase
even
on
foot
i
m
wrecking
this
car
cried
the
taxi
driver
in
protest
as
they
struck
a
particularly
deep
rut
keep
going
don
t
worry
about
the
car
cried
merritt
hughes
we
ve
got
to
get
out
of
this
the
engine
of
the
taxi
groaned
in
protest
of
the
punishment
which
it
was
undergoing
but
it
labored
on
dragging
the
heavy
vehicle
out
of
one
hole
and
into
another
bob
kept
his
eyes
on
the
pursuers
who
were
now
plainly
revealed
in
the
lights
from
the
other
car
they
seemed
to
be
gaining
on
the
struggling
taxi
we
d
better
take
a
chance
on
foot
he
warned
his
uncle
it
s
only
a
little
ways
to
the
end
of
this
construction
work
if
we
can
get
that
far
we
ll
soon
outdistance
them
replied
merritt
hughes
if
we
get
stalled
make
a
break
for
it
don
t
worry
about
me
once
you
get
clear
go
directly
to
the
department
of
justice
and
report
in
person
to
waldo
but
we
ll
have
a
better
chance
together
protested
bob
no
we
ll
go
it
alone
his
uncle
decided
that
will
confuse
them
and
one
of
us
is
bound
to
get
but
how
about
the
radio
secret
we
ve
got
to
chance
that
but
remember
that
you
are
the
one
they
ll
be
after
maybe
that
s
putting
you
on
the
spot
but
i
ve
got
to
do
it
now
it
s
our
only
the
headlights
of
the
taxi
showed
the
end
of
the
construction
work
a
smooth
street
was
less
than
feet
ahead
of
them
but
bob
thought
the
remainder
of
the
distance
they
must
go
looked
even
rougher
than
that
portion
of
the
street
they
had
negotiated
so
far
he
looked
behind
again
several
dim
shadows
the
men
chasing
them
were
dodging
down
the
street
he
doubted
if
they
were
gaining
now
the
taxi
dropped
into
a
deep
rut
and
the
engine
groaned
the
driver
shifted
gears
with
a
clash
that
racked
the
entire
car
and
the
wheels
spun
in
the
rut
then
they
shot
into
reverse
but
the
wheels
couldn
t
climb
out
we
re
stuck
cried
the
driver
i
m
with
a
single
motion
of
his
hand
he
struck
the
ignition
switch
and
the
motor
overheated
and
steaming
sputtered
and
died
the
headlights
also
went
out
and
bob
saw
the
now
dim
bulk
of
the
cab
driver
leap
away
from
the
car
and
vanish
get
out
bob
duck
and
keep
low
make
for
the
side
of
the
street
here
s
where
we
the
order
was
accompanied
by
a
firm
shove
toward
the
door
and
then
bob
was
rolling
in
the
street
for
he
had
missed
his
step
and
fallen
he
heard
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
cab
open
and
knew
that
his
uncle
had
made
his
escape
at
least
for
the
time
chapter
xxi
shots
in
the
night
the
street
was
long
flanked
by
what
appeared
to
be
warehouses
and
there
were
street
lights
only
at
the
ends
of
the
block
for
at
least
feet
in
the
middle
there
was
no
light
and
it
was
in
this
dismal
area
that
bob
and
his
uncle
were
trapped
a
pile
of
construction
materials
offered
the
first
shelter
for
bob
and
he
ducked
behind
this
from
this
shelter
he
listened
for
some
sound
from
the
men
who
had
been
pursuing
them
he
did
not
have
long
to
wait
for
sharp
voices
could
be
heard
a
little
further
back
along
the
street
the
taxi
s
stalled
someone
said
spread
out
and
let
them
have
it
if
they
make
a
break
we
ve
got
to
get
them
to
be
sure
we
ll
get
the
bob
behind
the
pile
of
construction
materials
heard
someone
pounding
down
the
street
the
beam
from
a
flashlight
shot
through
the
night
and
focused
on
the
taxi
driver
snap
off
that
light
came
a
tense
command
that
s
only
the
driver
let
him
he
ll
bring
the
cops
on
us
came
a
sharp
protest
but
the
first
voice
came
back
tartly
let
him
we
ll
be
out
of
here
long
before
he
can
get
his
nerve
back
and
talk
to
the
police
spread
out
i
tell
you
we
ve
got
to
move
fast
if
they
break
for
the
far
end
of
the
street
we
ll
see
them
under
the
street
lights
there
s
no
place
they
can
hide
at
each
the
last
words
confirmed
bob
s
fears
that
meant
that
there
was
no
shelter
in
the
buildings
which
flanked
the
street
this
time
there
was
no
friendly
hedge
into
which
he
could
leap
he
would
have
been
glad
to
have
risked
the
barberry
thorns
again
if
he
had
only
had
the
chance
the
taxi
was
less
than
twenty
feet
away
and
bob
knew
that
the
men
hunting
for
him
and
his
uncle
would
reach
it
in
a
few
more
seconds
then
one
of
the
first
places
where
they
would
search
would
be
the
pile
of
bricks
and
timbers
behind
which
he
had
sought
refuge
bob
moved
away
cautiously
a
plan
of
action
quickly
forming
in
his
mind
he
would
get
as
far
away
as
possible
then
make
some
noise
to
attract
their
attention
it
seemed
like
a
good
move
for
by
concentrating
their
attention
on
himself
he
would
provide
an
opportunity
for
his
uncle
to
slip
away
unnoticed
and
the
radio
document
could
be
delivered
safely
back
to
the
war
department
bob
felt
a
nervous
tension
gripping
his
entire
body
it
was
as
though
the
very
night
was
alive
to
the
danger
which
filled
the
deserted
street
the
pounding
footsteps
of
the
taxi
driver
gradually
died
away
and
only
bob
and
his
uncle
and
three
unknown
pursuers
were
in
the
street
a
flashlight
gleamed
for
a
moment
at
the
taxi
as
the
beam
sought
the
interior
nothing
here
bob
heard
someone
mutter
as
he
backed
away
from
the
sheltering
pile
of
materials
a
piece
of
board
crunched
under
his
feet
and
he
stumbled
and
half
fell
to
the
ground
what
s
that
the
exclamation
was
sharp
and
commanding
and
a
beam
of
light
swung
toward
him
bob
forgot
caution
and
scuttled
away
on
his
hands
and
feet
dodging
behind
the
piles
of
dirt
which
had
been
heaped
indiscriminately
around
the
street
the
flashlight
seemed
to
be
playing
a
game
of
hide
and
seek
with
him
for
not
once
did
the
beam
strike
him
and
he
found
temporary
shelter
again
behind
a
pile
of
bricks
but
the
sanctuary
was
not
to
last
for
long
from
the
voices
near
the
taxi
bob
knew
that
at
least
three
men
were
after
them
and
as
he
listened
he
heard
a
command
that
sent
a
chill
racing
along
his
spine
don
t
shoot
unless
you
have
to
but
let
them
have
it
if
it
looks
like
they
re
going
to
get
bob
remembered
that
his
uncle
had
a
gun
that
was
some
consolation
he
would
have
to
depend
upon
his
fists
for
self
protection
and
right
now
both
hands
were
sore
and
aching
from
his
encounter
earlier
in
the
day
with
the
thorns
of
the
barberry
the
young
federal
agent
crouched
close
to
the
ground
listening
for
some
sound
that
might
indicate
the
whereabouts
of
his
uncle
he
only
knew
that
merritt
hughes
had
dodged
out
the
other
side
of
the
taxi
since
then
there
had
been
no
sign
or
noise
to
reveal
where
he
had
sought
shelter
bob
strained
his
eyes
but
the
darkness
in
the
middle
of
the
block
was
intense
perhaps
after
all
that
was
a
blessing
for
it
gave
them
a
better
opportunity
to
hide
and
made
the
task
of
the
searchers
all
the
harder
impatient
and
cramped
from
hiding
behind
the
pile
of
bricks
bob
moved
away
he
was
determined
to
escape
from
the
trap
into
which
they
had
fallen
and
he
decided
that
by
working
his
way
back
along
the
street
toward
the
car
which
had
been
used
by
their
pursuers
might
offer
the
best
avenue
of
escape
a
bold
thought
occurred
it
might
even
be
possible
to
seize
their
car
and
make
his
own
escape
bob
crouching
low
crept
along
the
street
at
times
almost
crawling
it
wasn
t
a
pleasant
task
but
he
was
steadily
putting
distance
between
himself
and
the
stalled
taxi
where
he
knew
the
hunt
for
his
uncle
and
himself
was
being
concentrated
the
young
federal
agent
stumbled
over
a
timber
and
sprawled
headlong
on
the
dirt
to
bob
it
sounded
as
though
the
noise
of
his
fall
must
have
echoed
and
along
the
street
he
remained
motionless
almost
breathless
on
the
ground
waiting
for
the
pursuit
to
swing
toward
him
but
evidently
the
noise
of
his
tumble
was
not
as
great
as
he
had
feared
and
the
hunt
continued
near
the
taxi
bob
continued
his
cautious
advance
toward
the
car
which
had
brought
their
pursuers
he
was
not
certain
whether
anyone
had
been
left
to
guard
the
machine
and
he
moved
carefully
as
he
neared
the
vehicle
he
was
now
at
least
feet
from
the
stalled
taxi
and
he
had
no
desire
to
give
an
alarm
which
would
bring
the
others
swarming
toward
him
bob
now
had
decided
what
he
would
do
when
he
reached
the
car
in
turning
it
about
he
would
race
the
engine
which
would
be
sure
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
men
seeking
his
uncle
and
allow
him
to
escape
from
the
far
end
of
the
street
there
should
be
ample
time
for
bob
to
maneuver
the
car
about
and
get
it
started
back
down
the
street
before
he
could
be
overhauled
the
young
federal
agent
was
less
than
twenty
feet
from
the
car
close
enough
to
hear
the
soft
purring
of
its
powerful
engine
when
a
gun
blazed
from
behind
him
and
the
echoes
of
a
shot
resounded
between
the
buildings
which
flanked
the
street
chapter
xxii
the
lone
struggle
all
thoughts
of
escaping
in
the
car
vanished
from
bob
s
mind
on
the
echoes
of
the
shot
which
meant
that
his
uncle
had
been
discovered
that
he
was
a
target
for
gunfire
from
the
guns
of
their
pursuers
the
young
federal
agent
swung
about
in
his
tracks
and
started
back
down
the
street
stumbling
over
the
piles
of
debris
as
he
raced
forward
forgetful
now
of
any
danger
to
himself
and
thinking
only
of
his
chance
to
help
his
uncle
protect
the
precious
paper
which
was
in
his
possession
from
the
vicinity
of
the
stalled
taxi
cab
guns
were
barking
steadily
now
and
bob
paused
the
scarlet
flashes
marked
the
night
and
the
sharp
reports
from
the
guns
rang
back
and
forth
between
the
street
bob
counted
three
guns
in
action
all
directed
toward
a
darker
mass
near
the
far
end
of
the
street
then
another
gun
joined
in
the
fusillade
this
time
from
what
apparently
was
a
pile
of
debris
and
from
its
heavy
roar
bob
knew
that
it
was
his
uncle
s
automatic
merritt
hughes
who
had
made
his
way
cautiously
toward
the
far
end
of
the
street
had
been
discovered
just
before
he
could
make
a
final
break
to
safety
after
the
first
shot
from
the
guns
of
his
pursuers
he
had
taken
refuge
behind
a
pile
of
bricks
and
concrete
slabs
where
he
was
ready
to
make
a
determined
resistance
if
he
could
stand
off
the
attack
for
several
minutes
a
swarm
of
police
attracted
by
the
gunfire
would
descend
upon
them
but
the
men
in
the
street
were
shooting
carefully
and
spreading
out
attempting
to
encircle
him
and
force
his
surrender
they
were
moving
rapidly
dodging
so
quickly
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
single
them
out
in
the
shadows
or
to
flip
an
accurate
shot
at
them
his
ammunition
was
confined
to
the
one
clip
in
his
gun
and
a
spare
clip
in
his
coat
pocket
it
wouldn
t
last
long
in
an
encounter
with
three
gunmen
and
every
shot
must
be
made
to
count
a
close
shot
which
struck
a
slab
of
concrete
threw
a
fine
cloud
of
dust
into
his
eyes
and
blinded
him
for
the
moment
he
wondered
about
bob
and
whether
he
had
been
able
to
make
his
escape
if
he
hadn
t
before
this
now
surely
with
all
of
the
firing
he
would
be
able
to
escape
from
the
street
perhaps
he
would
even
be
able
to
lead
the
rescuing
police
which
he
felt
sure
would
come
soon
but
bob
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
had
his
own
ideas
about
the
police
and
the
need
for
a
hasty
rescue
he
paused
in
his
mad
dash
down
the
block
unarmed
he
would
be
no
match
for
the
gunmen
who
were
attempting
to
surround
his
uncle
and
obtain
the
paper
a
new
plan
formed
in
bob
s
mind
and
he
turned
determinedly
and
headed
for
the
car
it
was
a
large
and
powerful
sedan
with
a
motor
under
its
hood
that
equalled
the
power
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
horses
there
was
no
one
in
the
car
and
bob
slid
into
the
driver
s
seat
the
doors
were
unusually
high
and
heavy
and
he
guessed
that
the
car
was
bullet
proof
bob
reached
for
the
headlight
switch
then
thought
better
of
it
and
meshed
the
gears
into
low
he
tramped
on
the
throttle
and
the
motor
roared
into
action
with
a
lurch
the
heavy
car
plunged
off
the
pavement
and
into
the
street
which
was
undergoing
repairs
bob
would
have
liked
to
have
used
the
headlights
for
they
would
have
revealed
the
menace
of
hidden
mounds
of
dirt
and
bricks
and
other
construction
materials
but
to
have
switched
them
on
would
have
made
the
car
too
easy
a
target
for
the
gunmen
looking
ahead
bob
saw
the
flashes
of
gunfire
cease
as
though
the
men
who
had
been
pulling
the
triggers
were
surprised
and
alarmed
at
the
approach
of
the
car
then
there
was
a
spurt
of
flame
and
something
smacked
hard
against
the
windshield
he
saw
the
glass
shatter
but
it
did
not
break
and
it
gave
him
new
confidence
in
the
knowledge
that
the
car
was
protected
against
bullets
now
there
were
more
flashes
of
crimson
ahead
of
him
and
bullets
spanked
against
the
car
the
glass
of
a
headlight
shattered
into
a
thousand
bits
the
big
machine
rammed
into
a
pile
of
bricks
and
stalled
they
were
only
half
way
down
the
block
and
bob
reversed
quickly
and
backed
the
car
away
with
a
sharp
flip
of
the
wheel
he
skirted
the
obstruction
and
once
more
roared
ahead
the
car
gaining
speed
as
it
went
along
in
second
gear
the
roar
of
the
motor
was
so
loud
that
it
drowned
out
the
explosions
of
the
guns
bob
watching
for
some
sign
of
his
uncle
thought
he
saw
a
form
flit
toward
the
side
of
the
street
but
he
couldn
t
be
sure
the
car
bounced
in
and
out
of
a
ditch
the
wheels
spinning
frantically
and
finally
gaining
enough
traction
to
send
it
ahead
once
more
the
windshield
which
had
been
struck
four
times
was
a
maze
of
shattered
glass
and
bob
could
see
only
dimly
the
light
which
marked
the
end
of
the
street
it
was
impossible
to
discern
anything
ahead
of
him
and
he
turned
on
the
headlights
it
didn
t
matter
much
now
for
the
car
was
too
large
a
target
to
miss
but
the
lights
failed
to
come
on
some
bullet
had
probably
clipped
the
wires
and
bob
his
hands
wrapped
around
the
steering
wheel
hung
on
grimly
as
the
big
car
bounced
along
the
uneven
street
there
was
a
jarring
crash
and
the
big
car
its
wheels
still
spinning
futilely
came
to
a
stop
bob
was
knocked
against
the
steering
wheel
and
his
head
reeled
from
the
shock
dimly
he
heard
someone
jerk
open
the
door
and
he
tried
to
rally
his
dulled
senses
and
put
up
a
resistance
but
a
rough
hand
reached
him
and
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
he
was
conscious
that
a
light
blazed
suddenly
in
his
face
it
s
the
kid
cried
the
heavy
voice
i
ll
search
him
get
the
other
guy
bob
was
jerked
from
the
car
and
dropped
to
the
ground
once
more
the
flashlight
blazed
this
time
shielded
behind
a
pile
of
bricks
and
heavy
hands
went
through
his
pockets
as
his
head
cleared
bob
realized
his
situation
resistance
right
now
to
the
search
might
give
his
uncle
a
few
more
precious
minutes
and
bob
suddenly
doubled
up
his
knees
and
aimed
a
heavy
kick
at
the
man
who
was
bending
over
him
the
maneuver
caught
the
other
unaware
and
he
stumbled
back
against
the
pile
of
bricks
the
flashlight
dropping
to
the
ground
went
out
give
me
a
hand
over
here
the
kid
s
busted
my
flashlight
called
the
man
bob
had
kicked
then
it
felt
as
though
a
ton
of
beef
had
suddenly
been
dropped
on
him
for
the
man
who
had
captured
him
was
trying
to
make
sure
that
bob
would
not
squirm
away
from
him
just
to
make
sure
he
fell
heavily
on
the
young
federal
agent
and
bob
cried
out
in
pain
as
the
breath
was
forced
from
his
lungs
from
the
distance
came
the
shrill
siren
of
a
police
car
hurry
it
up
over
there
a
voice
called
we
ve
got
to
make
a
break
out
of
did
you
get
the
other
guy
demanded
the
man
who
was
almost
smothering
bob
not
on
the
echo
of
those
words
there
came
a
shot
and
a
cry
we
ve
got
him
bob
attempted
to
throw
off
his
assailant
but
a
thousand
stars
seemed
to
descend
upon
him
police
sirens
mixed
in
with
roaring
motors
and
blazing
guns
and
in
spite
of
his
efforts
he
dropped
into
a
jumbled
sleep
chapter
xxiii
anxious
hours
mixed
sounds
penetrated
through
a
maze
of
pain
which
filled
bob
s
head
when
he
finally
started
to
regain
consciousness
first
of
all
there
was
the
noise
of
police
sirens
which
seemed
to
fill
the
night
air
with
their
shrieks
bob
managed
to
raise
himself
up
on
one
elbow
just
as
a
car
careened
around
the
corner
and
screeched
to
a
stop
men
fairly
poured
from
the
car
and
bob
could
see
that
each
was
heavily
armed
lights
gleamed
in
the
disrupted
street
and
bob
turned
to
look
for
the
car
which
he
had
commandeered
and
from
which
he
had
been
so
roughly
jerked
it
had
vanished
and
only
the
damaged
taxi
remained
the
echo
of
the
gunfire
had
died
away
a
beam
of
light
focused
on
bob
and
a
sharp
command
followed
don
t
move
at
the
moment
bob
ached
too
much
to
care
whether
he
ever
moved
someone
came
up
from
behind
him
and
jerked
him
roughly
to
his
feet
snap
a
pair
of
handcuffs
on
this
bird
we
ll
question
him
the
command
was
from
an
officer
who
seemed
to
be
in
charge
of
the
squad
from
back
down
the
street
more
sirens
shrilled
and
bob
saw
two
more
cars
pull
to
a
stop
and
officers
unload
hastily
let
me
explain
protested
bob
if
you
ll
only
look
in
the
case
inside
my
coat
you
ll
find
my
identification
papers
i
m
a
provisional
federal
one
of
the
police
laughed
scornfully
that
s
a
fine
story
you
re
only
a
bob
was
tired
and
worried
now
about
his
uncle
hot
tears
of
anger
welled
into
his
eyes
and
his
voice
trembled
as
he
replied
you
d
better
take
the
time
to
make
sure
before
you
handcuff
me
a
federal
agent
has
been
kidnaped
on
this
street
and
you
d
better
hunt
for
him
instead
of
wasting
your
time
on
who
was
kidnaped
the
question
was
asked
by
a
newcomer
who
had
joined
the
group
my
uncle
merritt
hughes
replied
bob
he
s
in
the
department
of
say
maybe
there
is
something
to
his
story
chimed
in
another
officer
i
know
there
is
a
federal
agent
by
the
name
of
then
you
d
better
start
looking
for
him
he
was
down
at
the
end
of
this
street
a
couple
of
minutes
ago
the
target
for
three
gunmen
we
were
trapped
here
in
the
taxi
that
s
deserted
over
get
busy
boys
and
see
what
you
can
find
ordered
the
sergeant
who
was
in
command
of
the
squad
i
ll
take
this
boy
down
to
the
corner
and
we
ll
phone
the
department
of
justice
and
check
up
on
his
while
the
police
detail
spread
out
to
comb
the
street
the
sergeant
and
bob
walked
back
to
the
police
car
it
will
go
hard
on
you
kid
if
you
re
trying
to
pull
anything
on
us
warned
the
sergeant
don
t
worry
about
that
bob
reassured
him
just
let
me
get
to
a
telephone
where
i
can
get
in
touch
with
waldo
they
walked
to
the
corner
and
then
turned
to
their
right
half
way
down
the
next
block
there
was
a
small
drug
store
and
they
found
a
pay
telephone
there
bob
entered
the
booth
while
the
sergeant
a
blocky
man
of
about
stuck
his
foot
in
the
door
so
that
it
would
remain
open
and
he
could
hear
the
conversation
hand
me
your
papers
he
told
bob
and
the
young
federal
agent
handed
over
the
small
leather
case
which
he
carried
in
an
inner
pocket
bob
s
fingers
skimmed
the
pages
of
the
telephone
directory
until
he
found
the
desired
number
dropping
a
nickel
in
the
phone
he
dialed
for
the
department
of
justice
when
an
operator
answered
he
gave
his
message
quickly
and
concisely
i
ll
give
you
edgar
at
once
promised
the
operator
it
was
only
a
few
seconds
later
when
bob
heard
the
voice
of
the
chief
of
the
division
of
investigation
of
the
department
of
justice
it
was
a
rich
full
voice
that
once
heard
would
never
be
forgotten
bob
identified
himself
quickly
and
then
in
rapid
sentences
told
what
had
happened
your
uncle
had
the
paper
the
last
you
saw
of
him
asked
the
federal
chief
yes
replied
bob
he
was
attempting
to
reach
the
far
end
of
the
street
and
escape
while
i
attracted
the
attention
of
the
men
trying
to
capture
him
but
i
was
knocked
out
and
i
don
t
know
what
happened
when
the
police
arrived
the
street
was
deserted
and
the
sedan
was
we
ll
spread
an
alarm
at
once
said
edgar
see
that
you
are
released
at
once
by
the
police
then
come
here
at
bob
turned
to
the
sergeant
satisfied
about
my
identity
he
asked
you
re
okay
grinned
the
sergeant
handing
back
the
leather
case
which
bob
slipped
into
his
coat
i
ll
be
over
at
once
he
promised
the
federal
chief
he
stepped
out
of
the
booth
and
started
to
hasten
toward
the
door
but
a
question
from
the
sergeant
detained
him
can
you
give
us
a
description
of
that
car
we
ll
have
it
broadcast
over
the
police
radio
and
also
on
the
teletype
circuit
some
of
our
men
may
pick
up
the
machine
and
the
sooner
we
can
get
a
report
the
better
chance
we
ll
have
of
finding
your
bob
s
description
of
the
car
was
meager
he
wasn
t
even
sure
of
the
make
but
it
had
looked
like
a
large
romney
sedan
the
windshield
is
shattered
and
there
ought
to
be
a
number
of
bullet
marks
on
the
body
he
said
i
guess
that
will
be
the
best
way
to
identify
we
ll
shut
down
on
every
road
out
of
the
city
they
can
t
get
away
promised
the
sergeant
as
he
stepped
back
into
the
booth
to
telephone
the
description
to
police
headquarters
but
bob
had
his
own
doubts
as
to
whether
the
police
would
be
able
to
apprehend
the
car
too
much
time
had
elapsed
even
now
the
big
machine
might
be
speeding
out
of
the
city
it
was
then
that
bob
disobeyed
his
orders
from
the
federal
chief
instead
of
summoning
a
taxi
he
hastened
back
to
the
street
where
the
attack
had
taken
place
he
wanted
to
be
sure
that
his
uncle
had
not
been
wounded
and
left
there
when
he
arrived
the
police
squad
had
completed
its
search
find
anyone
asked
bob
anxiously
not
even
a
good
ghost
grumbled
one
of
the
officers
say
that
taxi
s
a
but
bob
had
no
time
to
waste
in
talk
over
a
damaged
taxi
he
half
ran
and
half
walked
to
the
nearest
thoroughfare
where
he
flagged
a
taxi
and
ordered
the
driver
to
take
him
to
the
department
of
justice
building
on
the
way
over
bob
reviewed
the
events
of
the
night
with
the
disappearance
of
his
uncle
the
case
had
deepened
and
he
felt
as
though
he
was
drifting
in
a
sea
of
puzzling
problems
on
reaching
the
department
of
justice
building
bob
went
directly
to
the
upper
floor
where
the
federal
chief
s
office
was
located
an
agent
evidently
watching
for
him
escorted
him
into
the
inner
office
and
bob
s
eyes
widened
as
he
saw
condon
adams
and
tully
ross
seated
beside
waldo
edgar
s
desk
the
federal
chief
rose
as
bob
came
in
have
a
chair
bob
we
want
to
hear
in
detail
everything
that
went
on
tonight
now
that
your
uncle
has
disappeared
you
ll
have
to
work
with
adams
and
ross
here
on
the
case
i
m
counting
on
you
for
a
lot
of
good
chapter
xxiv
a
solitary
hand
bob
as
he
eased
his
weary
body
into
a
chair
looked
at
condon
adams
and
tully
ross
both
of
them
looked
tired
and
worn
and
their
faces
reflected
the
strain
they
had
been
under
since
the
escape
of
the
prisoner
from
the
police
station
some
more
bungling
i
expect
snapped
condon
adams
the
words
were
harsh
and
uncalled
for
and
bob
s
temper
flared
quickly
if
it
was
bungling
it
wasn
t
the
first
bit
of
it
today
he
shot
back
at
the
older
federal
agent
adams
face
flushed
he
started
to
reply
then
thought
better
of
it
and
remained
silent
i
want
to
know
everything
in
detail
bob
said
the
federal
chief
just
tell
me
all
that
happened
this
we
were
eating
dinner
said
bob
when
i
happened
to
put
my
hand
in
my
coat
pocket
and
i
felt
a
paper
in
there
when
i
pulled
it
out
and
discovered
what
it
was
i
was
the
word
was
whispered
but
everyone
in
the
room
heard
it
and
bob
whirled
toward
tully
another
crack
like
that
out
of
you
and
i
ll
take
you
all
apart
he
flared
calm
down
boys
said
waldo
edgar
we
ve
got
to
get
facts
and
get
them
at
once
a
man
s
life
may
be
hanging
in
the
balance
go
on
bob
went
on
to
describe
the
start
of
their
trip
to
the
department
of
justice
building
we
saw
a
car
following
us
but
we
were
holding
our
own
until
we
turned
into
a
street
where
there
was
a
lot
of
repair
work
going
on
our
taxi
driver
tried
to
get
through
but
the
cab
became
stalled
and
he
took
to
his
bob
paused
a
moment
the
recent
action
in
the
street
was
so
vivid
that
it
was
hard
to
describe
uncle
merritt
and
i
decided
it
would
be
better
to
try
to
make
it
alone
and
we
parted
just
as
these
gunmen
unloaded
i
managed
to
crawl
back
to
their
car
and
when
they
started
shooting
at
uncle
merritt
i
took
their
car
and
rammed
it
down
the
street
in
an
effort
to
attract
their
attention
and
give
him
a
chance
to
is
there
any
chance
that
he
got
away
asked
the
federal
chief
leaning
forward
anxiously
in
his
chair
bob
shook
his
head
the
last
thing
i
remember
was
a
single
shot
and
then
someone
cried
we
ve
got
then
someone
slugged
me
and
i
didn
t
regain
consciousness
until
the
police
arrived
they
haven
t
found
a
trace
of
i
was
afraid
that
was
the
case
said
the
federal
chief
we
ve
swung
a
tight
cordon
around
the
entire
city
and
i
m
even
having
the
airports
checked
we
won
t
overlook
a
single
angle
something
will
turn
up
before
the
telephone
buzzed
and
the
federal
chief
seized
it
eagerly
but
his
face
fell
as
some
routine
message
came
over
the
wire
when
he
had
completed
the
conversation
he
turned
toward
condon
adams
now
that
merritt
hughes
is
off
the
case
you
ll
be
in
direct
charge
of
finding
him
and
recovering
that
paper
i
m
assigning
bob
to
give
you
some
help
wherever
you
need
adams
showed
his
displeasure
but
he
was
careful
not
to
make
it
too
obvious
to
waldo
edgar
thanks
he
granted
i
may
need
the
kid
for
some
leg
work
but
he
always
seems
to
be
getting
into
it
was
biting
sarcasm
but
bob
chose
to
ignore
it
this
latest
development
went
on
the
federal
chief
puts
us
right
back
where
we
were
after
we
thought
the
paper
had
vanished
from
the
office
while
in
reality
it
was
in
bob
s
pocket
the
one
prisoner
who
could
have
given
us
some
information
slipped
out
of
our
hands
and
one
of
my
best
agents
has
been
abducted
that
means
whoever
is
after
this
information
is
both
desperate
and
the
federal
chief
looked
at
bob
whose
face
was
still
flushed
from
the
recent
fight
in
the
street
got
a
gun
bob
i
ve
a
waldo
edgar
shook
his
head
that
s
not
heavy
enough
he
summoned
an
assistant
who
returned
shortly
with
a
stubby
but
serviceable
gun
and
two
clips
of
cartridges
this
is
a
new
gun
with
which
we
are
equipping
our
agents
explained
edgar
it
s
a
and
when
you
hit
anything
with
that
you
stop
it
even
if
it
is
a
freight
train
you
can
t
afford
to
go
rummaging
around
washington
at
night
without
ample
protection
while
you
re
on
this
so
far
i
ve
been
able
to
make
pretty
good
use
of
my
fists
grinned
bob
but
this
may
come
in
handy
in
a
any
orders
for
bob
tonight
asked
edgar
directing
his
question
at
condon
adams
i
won
t
need
him
was
the
tart
reply
he
might
as
well
go
home
and
get
some
i
may
get
a
little
sleep
but
i
m
not
going
home
replied
bob
that
s
too
popular
with
certain
unpleasant
people
you
can
find
me
at
a
hotel
and
i
ll
probably
change
my
address
every
he
named
a
small
hotel
which
was
near
his
own
room
that
s
a
good
idea
said
waldo
edgar
but
be
sure
to
keep
us
informed
every
time
you
shift
to
a
new
address
we
ll
let
you
know
the
minute
we
get
any
information
on
your
uncle
now
you
d
better
get
home
and
get
some
bob
admitted
that
he
was
mighty
tired
but
he
was
far
from
sleepy
for
his
mind
was
still
spinning
in
circles
when
he
left
the
office
condon
adams
and
tully
ross
stepped
out
into
the
hall
with
him
and
they
descended
to
the
main
floor
in
the
same
elevator
bob
could
feel
the
cold
wave
of
animosity
which
engulfed
the
others
and
he
knew
that
though
they
would
make
every
effort
to
recover
the
radio
secret
they
probably
would
not
overtax
their
energies
in
finding
his
uncle
as
they
walked
toward
the
main
door
condon
adams
spoke
we
ll
call
on
you
when
we
need
help
but
this
thing
is
going
to
be
easy
too
bad
your
uncle
muffed
it
this
bob
wheeled
and
faced
him
squarely
let
s
have
an
understanding
right
now
in
the
first
place
my
uncle
didn
t
muff
anything
i
d
like
to
have
seen
you
do
any
better
than
he
did
when
three
gunmen
were
shooting
at
you
in
a
dark
street
and
the
only
escape
was
at
an
end
where
there
was
a
brilliant
street
light
now
as
far
as
getting
things
in
a
mess
it
seems
to
me
that
you
did
a
perfect
job
when
you
let
that
prisoner
the
one
man
who
could
have
supplied
valuable
information
take
your
gun
away
from
you
in
the
police
station
this
afternoon
that
makes
you
out
to
be
quite
a
chump
and
i
ve
always
thought
you
bob
was
surprised
at
his
own
words
and
his
own
boldness
but
he
saw
a
look
something
like
apprehension
in
condon
adams
eyes
you
don
t
like
my
uncle
you
never
have
you
ve
always
been
jealous
of
his
brains
and
his
ability
your
nephew
doesn
t
like
me
well
that
goes
for
me
too
i
don
t
think
you
ll
make
any
effort
to
find
my
uncle
if
you
can
recover
that
paper
well
and
s
your
first
thought
but
i
m
serving
notice
on
you
right
now
that
i
m
going
to
find
him
and
i
m
going
to
recover
that
paper
and
i
ll
do
it
without
any
help
from
either
one
of
you
so
here
s
a
tip
i
m
tired
and
i
m
mad
and
i
don
t
like
you
right
now
i
can
think
of
nothing
i
d
like
to
do
better
than
give
each
of
you
a
biff
on
the
nose
and
if
you
open
your
mouths
again
about
my
uncle
i
ll
do
just
that
thing
good
bob
s
words
had
so
amazed
both
adams
and
his
nephew
that
they
were
speechless
and
the
young
federal
agent
turned
and
stepped
through
the
main
doorway
tully
ross
angry
words
crowding
to
his
lips
started
to
follow
bob
but
the
firm
hands
of
condon
adams
stopped
him
keep
your
head
tully
he
warned
the
boy
s
mad
clear
through
and
he
d
do
just
what
he
up
on
both
of
us
maybe
we
ve
got
it
coming
though
we
baited
him
too
much
but
we
re
going
to
find
that
missing
radio
the
same
resolution
was
in
bob
s
heart
as
he
stepped
down
the
avenue
but
in
addition
was
the
grim
determination
that
he
would
find
his
uncle
chapter
xxv
the
first
clue
the
coolness
of
the
fall
night
helped
to
clear
the
mad
whirl
of
bob
s
fatigued
mind
and
he
mulled
over
the
things
that
had
happened
as
he
walked
down
the
avenue
for
nearly
hours
the
missing
paper
had
been
in
his
possession
which
accounted
for
the
attempt
to
kidnap
him
but
how
had
it
leaked
that
the
paper
had
been
sent
over
to
the
archives
division
for
had
known
that
he
would
be
alone
that
night
bob
felt
that
knowing
the
answer
to
this
question
he
would
have
something
on
which
to
base
his
further
investigation
then
there
was
the
disappearance
of
his
uncle
that
night
bob
knew
that
both
the
radio
document
and
the
federal
agent
were
in
the
hands
of
ruthless
and
relentless
men
from
what
his
uncle
had
told
him
before
the
radio
secret
was
worth
a
huge
amount
to
almost
every
foreign
power
and
he
dared
not
guess
what
country
might
be
interested
in
obtaining
its
possession
through
such
means
as
had
been
employed
bob
s
walk
took
him
to
the
archives
building
and
he
automatically
turned
in
and
went
up
to
the
office
where
he
worked
the
guard
on
duty
on
that
floor
was
a
familiar
one
and
bob
spoke
to
him
briefly
anything
unusual
tonight
he
asked
not
a
thing
was
the
quick
and
honest
reply
bob
walked
down
the
corridor
unlocked
the
door
of
the
office
switched
on
the
lights
and
stepped
inside
the
room
appeared
to
be
just
as
he
had
left
it
in
the
afternoon
and
bob
sat
down
at
his
desk
it
was
quiet
here
and
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
think
out
some
of
his
problems
but
he
found
himself
too
tired
even
for
that
his
head
was
heavy
and
he
drowsed
at
his
desk
half
an
hour
passed
and
bob
fell
into
a
sound
slumber
for
an
hour
he
slept
at
his
desk
until
the
tapping
of
the
guard
at
the
door
aroused
him
bob
opened
the
door
in
response
to
the
summons
thought
something
might
have
happened
to
you
said
the
guard
half
apologetically
something
did
smiled
bob
i
went
sound
asleep
i
d
better
get
out
of
here
and
get
to
while
the
guard
looked
on
bob
turned
off
the
lights
locked
the
room
and
started
toward
the
elevator
the
guard
halted
him
a
few
paces
down
the
hall
sorry
houston
but
i
ll
have
to
search
you
there
s
a
new
rule
that
anyone
working
on
this
floor
out
of
hours
must
be
bob
was
half
inclined
to
be
angry
but
he
realized
the
soundness
of
this
rule
especially
after
what
had
just
taken
place
he
quietly
submitted
to
a
careful
search
of
his
clothing
by
the
guard
you
know
your
job
said
bob
when
the
search
was
over
i
used
to
be
a
store
detective
replied
the
other
with
not
a
little
pride
in
his
voice
and
if
i
do
say
it
myself
i
was
one
of
the
best
in
it
was
only
a
few
blocks
to
the
hotel
at
which
bob
had
decided
to
take
up
temporary
quarters
and
he
walked
the
short
distance
at
a
brisk
pace
he
registered
asking
for
a
quiet
inside
room
but
the
clerk
looked
dubious
when
bob
informed
him
he
had
no
baggage
but
would
arrange
to
have
his
clothes
sent
down
in
the
morning
you
ll
have
to
pay
in
advance
he
said
bob
delved
into
his
pockets
in
search
of
money
and
to
his
embarrassment
found
that
he
had
less
than
a
dollar
the
clerk
appeared
skeptical
it
was
late
and
after
the
fight
in
the
street
bob
s
clothes
were
in
none
too
good
condition
perhaps
you
d
better
try
another
hotel
he
suggested
by
that
time
bob
longed
for
nothing
more
than
a
comfortable
bed
and
a
few
hours
of
sleep
and
his
feet
were
heavy
they
wouldn
t
have
carried
him
another
block
reaching
inside
his
coat
he
pulled
out
the
billfold
and
drew
out
the
identification
badge
which
had
been
given
to
him
by
the
federal
chief
i
guess
this
will
identify
me
even
though
i
m
temporarily
short
of
funds
said
bob
now
i
want
that
room
and
i
don
t
want
to
be
disturbed
unless
there
is
something
really
important
understand
the
clerk
stared
at
the
identification
card
and
his
whole
manner
changed
into
one
of
the
utmost
courtesy
in
less
than
ten
minutes
bob
was
in
bed
to
drop
into
a
sleep
that
was
to
be
disturbed
hours
later
by
the
strident
ringing
of
the
telephone
on
the
stand
beside
his
bed
it
was
broad
daylight
when
bob
rubbed
the
sleep
from
his
eyes
and
answered
the
telephone
yes
this
is
bob
houston
speaking
he
said
the
words
which
came
over
the
wire
caught
and
held
his
attention
yes
i
understand
of
course
come
right
over
i
ll
be
dressed
and
ready
to
go
over
the
entire
bob
hung
up
the
receiver
reached
the
bathroom
in
one
long
jump
and
in
another
had
the
shower
on
and
was
under
it
after
a
brisk
shower
he
rubbed
his
body
down
thoroughly
feeling
ready
for
what
he
knew
was
to
be
a
busy
day
the
caller
was
lieutenant
frederick
gibbons
of
the
intelligence
unit
of
the
war
department
who
had
been
assigned
to
help
on
the
case
he
had
promised
bob
information
of
vital
importance
and
almost
before
bob
had
finished
dressing
there
was
a
knock
when
bob
opened
the
door
a
trim
soldierly
figure
was
standing
in
the
hall
lieutenant
gibbons
asked
bob
right
i
take
it
you
re
bob
houston
bob
nodded
how
about
breakfast
asked
the
intelligence
officer
i
m
ready
now
and
hungry
grinned
bob
then
we
ll
eat
and
talk
the
coffee
shop
downstairs
is
after
they
had
placed
their
orders
for
breakfast
lieutenant
gibbons
leaned
toward
bob
how
long
have
you
been
asleep
he
asked
it
must
have
been
nearly
three
o
clock
before
i
went
to
bed
here
was
the
reply
then
a
lot
of
things
have
happened
since
you
dropped
out
of
this
has
my
uncle
been
found
asked
bob
anxiously
i
m
sorry
but
he
hasn
t
however
we
ve
turned
up
some
clues
that
may
prove
mighty
interesting
the
car
in
which
he
was
abducted
has
been
where
the
question
was
sharp
and
anxious
down
near
the
tidal
was
there
any
trace
of
him
there
was
a
stain
or
two
on
the
rear
cushions
of
the
car
but
nothing
serious
so
if
he
was
wounded
last
night
i
don
t
think
we
need
to
worry
about
but
the
tidal
basin
does
that
though
bob
left
the
question
unfinished
the
lieutenant
guessed
what
he
feared
and
was
quick
to
ease
his
mind
i
m
sure
your
uncle
is
still
a
captive
we
ve
learned
that
sometime
late
in
the
night
a
motor
boat
dashed
out
of
the
basin
and
down
the
potomac
it
was
a
strange
boat
that
came
up
the
river
early
in
the
evening
we
ve
a
fairly
good
description
of
the
craft
and
may
be
able
to
trace
it
down
now
our
first
mission
is
to
locate
your
uncle
and
recover
that
bob
liked
the
manner
in
which
lieutenant
gibbons
spoke
the
intelligence
officer
looked
keen
and
alive
to
everything
he
was
a
little
taller
than
bob
and
slender
with
a
slenderness
that
was
wiry
his
eyes
were
a
sparkling
brown
and
there
was
an
upward
twist
to
his
lips
that
bob
liked
have
you
heard
whether
condon
adams
and
tully
ross
have
turned
up
anything
asked
bob
a
frown
marred
the
lieutenant
s
forehead
they
ve
been
busy
he
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
ve
caused
the
arrest
of
arthur
jacobs
they
found
some
rather
suspicious
looking
things
at
his
apartment
including
some
half
burned
scraps
of
paper
in
a
fireplace
in
which
someone
was
offering
jacobs
for
information
on
the
radio
does
it
look
like
a
real
lead
bob
was
anxious
it
may
but
i
hate
to
believe
it
jacobs
is
a
foreigner
and
he
has
a
brother
who
only
recently
escaped
from
a
midwestern
prison
and
who
has
made
a
bad
does
his
description
tally
with
that
of
the
fellow
who
escaped
from
jail
that
s
just
it
there
is
a
real
resemblance
and
condon
adams
says
he
is
certain
that
jacobs
brother
fritz
is
the
man
who
escaped
from
maybe
adams
is
too
anxious
to
build
up
a
case
said
bob
that
s
true
but
the
facts
are
starting
to
click
and
it
looks
like
the
jacobs
brothers
are
going
to
be
in
for
some
unpleasant
hours
arthur
is
down
at
the
central
station
but
it
doesn
t
seem
possible
i
ve
known
him
for
a
long
time
he
didn
t
seem
like
the
kind
who
would
get
involved
in
anything
like
that
s
just
when
you
lose
your
way
he
said
don
t
take
anything
for
granted
if
you
want
to
succeed
in
intelligence
work
you
have
to
put
a
question
mark
around
chapter
xxvi
a
break
for
bob
breakfast
at
an
end
they
left
the
hotel
and
the
intelligence
officer
hailed
a
taxicab
we
ll
go
down
and
listen
in
on
this
grilling
he
said
bob
didn
t
relish
seeing
arthur
jacobs
his
filing
chief
under
the
barrage
of
questions
he
knew
condon
adams
would
hurl
at
the
little
man
but
he
steeled
his
nerves
for
he
knew
that
in
his
new
work
he
must
be
willing
and
prepared
to
face
many
an
ordeal
they
found
a
small
group
in
a
plain
room
there
was
none
of
the
pictured
third
degree
methods
arthur
jacobs
looked
worried
and
tired
he
sat
behind
a
table
a
pitcher
and
glass
of
water
within
easy
reach
lounging
across
the
table
from
him
was
adams
his
fingers
drumming
incessantly
on
the
table
at
another
table
at
one
side
sat
a
stenographer
and
tully
ross
was
sitting
in
a
chair
tilted
back
against
the
wall
just
after
bob
and
the
intelligence
officer
arrived
waldo
edgar
looked
in
any
results
he
asked
not
so
far
grunted
condon
adams
but
this
fellow
has
a
story
to
tell
and
he
s
going
to
break
pretty
a
look
of
desperation
flickered
for
a
moment
in
arthur
jacobs
eyes
and
he
turned
toward
bob
hello
jacobs
said
bob
i
didn
t
think
i
d
ever
see
you
there
was
just
a
trace
of
a
smile
around
the
filing
chief
s
lips
when
he
replied
i
never
thought
i
would
be
here
bob
who
s
in
charge
of
the
office
with
both
of
us
away
i
don
t
know
but
i
ll
find
out
if
you
i
would
said
the
filing
chief
simply
and
bob
stepped
into
an
adjoining
office
and
telephoned
the
archives
division
where
he
was
informed
that
a
senior
clerk
from
another
office
had
taken
over
the
duties
temporarily
when
bob
stepped
back
into
the
larger
room
jacobs
was
sweating
freely
everything
s
all
right
at
the
office
volunteered
bob
who
felt
sorry
for
the
little
man
bondurance
from
the
next
office
is
taking
charge
and
they
re
getting
along
all
right
of
course
they
miss
i
m
afraid
they
won
t
get
those
papers
back
in
the
proper
order
it
s
an
awful
bob
agreed
that
it
was
and
he
couldn
t
make
himself
feel
that
arthur
jacobs
so
obviously
worried
about
the
routine
at
the
office
could
be
guilty
of
anything
very
bad
come
on
now
jacobs
broke
in
the
heavy
voice
of
condon
adams
quit
this
stalling
and
get
down
to
business
how
much
did
you
get
for
selling
out
this
secret
but
i
tell
you
i
didn
t
get
anything
replied
the
filing
chief
spreading
his
hands
out
on
the
table
in
a
dramatic
denial
how
many
times
must
i
tell
you
this
until
you
tell
me
the
truth
and
admit
that
you
were
paid
to
sell
information
on
a
government
oh
go
away
quit
bothering
me
cried
the
man
behind
the
table
he
stood
up
and
pointed
at
adams
get
out
get
out
leave
bob
here
i
ll
talk
to
him
i
can
trust
him
condon
adams
half
rose
in
utter
surprise
at
the
force
of
jacobs
words
then
he
dropped
back
into
his
chair
and
a
look
of
sullen
resentment
swept
over
his
face
you
ll
tell
me
or
no
one
he
growled
but
from
the
back
of
the
room
where
he
had
stepped
in
unnoticed
waldo
edgar
spoke
quietly
let
jacobs
talk
in
his
own
way
he
ruled
the
rest
of
us
will
step
out
while
bob
talks
with
the
legs
of
the
chair
in
which
tully
ross
had
been
leaning
back
against
the
wall
struck
the
floor
with
a
thud
and
tully
started
to
protest
but
his
uncle
realizing
the
futility
waved
him
into
silence
lieutenant
gibbons
grinned
at
bob
as
the
others
left
the
room
he
was
the
last
to
step
out
and
he
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
when
they
were
alone
a
tremendous
burden
seemed
to
lift
from
the
shoulders
of
the
filing
chief
i
ve
got
to
talk
he
told
bob
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
anyone
at
the
door
to
hear
but
i
had
to
talk
with
someone
i
could
he
paused
for
a
moment
your
uncle
is
missing
he
was
kidnaped
last
night
replied
bob
there
were
three
in
the
gang
and
they
got
him
and
the
radio
paper
which
was
stolen
from
our
arthur
jacobs
nodded
sorrowfully
i
m
sorry
about
that
bob
for
he
is
in
great
danger
then
i
ll
tell
my
story
as
quickly
as
i
can
then
you
must
act
without
loss
of
chapter
xxvii
action
ahead
arthur
jacobs
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
and
then
reached
for
the
glass
of
water
he
drained
it
at
one
gulp
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
an
air
of
relief
on
his
face
bob
tense
waited
for
him
to
speak
when
the
words
finally
came
they
rushed
out
in
a
torrent
and
bob
heard
a
story
that
wrenched
at
his
own
heart
it
s
been
terrible
bob
terrible
i
ve
got
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
when
fritz
escaped
from
prison
he
made
his
way
east
and
i
had
letters
from
him
he
needed
money
he
had
always
needed
money
as
far
as
that
was
concerned
when
i
sent
word
that
i
had
none
to
spare
he
started
threatening
me
then
he
fell
in
with
bad
company
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
he
was
here
in
the
filing
chief
paused
a
moment
and
wiped
his
forehead
again
for
the
perspiration
was
running
freely
fritz
came
to
my
apartment
and
demanded
money
but
i
actually
didn
t
have
it
he
went
away
for
a
while
and
then
came
again
later
it
was
on
this
visit
last
week
that
i
got
some
inkling
of
what
was
in
his
mind
he
started
hinting
around
about
the
secrets
which
passed
through
my
hands
for
filing
and
for
after
an
hour
or
so
he
came
out
in
the
open
and
made
me
a
proposition
he
knew
where
he
could
sell
the
secret
of
this
new
and
guided
plane
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
the
war
department
the
filing
chief
stopped
to
pour
out
another
glass
of
water
go
on
urged
bob
who
was
desperately
anxious
to
learn
the
full
story
and
then
resume
the
hunt
for
his
uncle
fritz
offered
me
for
my
share
if
i
would
only
tell
him
when
the
papers
reached
the
office
he
said
that
was
all
they
needed
to
know
i
could
have
used
the
but
i
told
him
i
wouldn
t
do
such
a
thing
then
a
couple
of
days
later
i
got
a
letter
from
him
it
was
mailed
somewhere
over
in
maryland
and
he
repeated
his
offer
and
threatened
me
with
exposing
an
old
family
that
was
the
letter
condon
adams
found
exclaimed
bob
and
the
filing
chief
nodded
i
was
careless
about
that
i
tossed
it
in
the
fireplace
but
didn
t
make
sure
that
it
had
been
but
did
you
supply
your
brother
with
the
necessary
information
asked
bob
pressing
hard
for
more
concrete
information
arthur
jacobs
lowered
his
head
fritz
came
back
the
other
night
he
was
in
a
terrible
rage
he
had
promised
to
get
this
information
from
me
and
had
failed
you
ll
never
know
the
fear
i
ve
always
had
of
fritz
he
was
bigger
older
and
he
always
bullied
me
he
threatened
to
beat
me
to
death
and
i
finally
told
him
what
he
wanted
to
bob
saw
tears
welling
into
the
chief
clerk
s
eyes
and
he
turned
his
own
face
away
for
it
had
not
been
easy
to
hear
this
confession
when
the
young
federal
agent
finally
looked
back
arthur
jacobs
was
composed
and
calm
once
more
when
did
you
give
him
this
information
it
was
the
night
before
you
caught
fritz
in
the
office
replied
jacobs
have
you
seen
him
since
then
yes
he
came
to
my
apartment
after
his
escape
and
i
sheltered
him
for
a
few
hours
i
didn
t
want
to
but
he
was
armed
and
forced
me
to
do
it
that
s
all
i
know
about
don
t
you
know
who
s
behind
fritz
who
is
supplying
him
with
the
money
arthur
jacobs
shook
his
head
i
didn
t
even
see
any
money
he
said
bitterly
fritz
said
that
would
come
later
after
this
thing
had
been
bob
felt
sorry
for
the
little
man
for
he
knew
now
that
jacobs
had
been
the
unwilling
dupe
of
an
older
and
bullying
brother
there
was
one
bit
of
information
bob
must
have
one
thing
that
was
vital
did
you
save
the
envelope
in
which
the
letter
fritz
sent
you
from
maryland
was
mailed
he
asked
jacobs
ran
his
fingers
through
his
thinning
hair
i
can
t
did
you
toss
it
in
the
fireplace
no
i
don
t
think
so
i
probably
dropped
it
in
the
wastebasket
the
maid
cleans
my
apartment
each
then
where
would
this
type
of
rubbish
go
down
to
the
janitor
who
would
burn
it
in
the
bob
reached
for
the
telephone
on
the
other
table
give
me
the
number
of
your
apartment
house
he
urged
and
jacobs
supplied
the
needed
information
the
building
superintendent
answered
and
bob
s
words
fairly
tumbled
over
the
wire
this
is
bob
houston
a
federal
agent
speaking
he
said
get
hold
of
your
janitor
at
once
don
t
allow
him
to
burn
any
more
waste
paper
or
refuse
of
any
type
from
the
floor
on
which
arthur
jacobs
lives
i
ll
be
there
within
half
an
hour
to
check
up
on
the
building
superintendent
was
inclined
to
argue
but
bob
cut
him
short
this
is
no
time
for
words
he
said
do
as
you
re
told
or
i
ll
file
a
charge
against
you
for
interfering
with
the
work
of
a
federal
actually
bob
didn
t
know
whether
he
had
that
power
or
not
but
the
words
sounded
well
and
the
threat
did
what
was
superintendent
changed
his
tone
and
agreed
to
halt
the
burning
of
any
more
wastepaper
or
refuse
bob
turned
back
from
the
telephone
and
jacobs
looked
at
him
with
a
brighter
face
i
don
t
know
what
s
going
to
happen
to
me
he
said
but
i
feel
better
for
having
told
i
ll
help
you
all
i
can
promised
bob
heartily
turning
to
call
for
lieutenant
gibbons
the
intelligence
officer
opened
the
door
almost
instantly
and
condon
adams
and
tully
ross
crowded
in
close
behind
him
well
can
you
solve
the
mystery
for
us
now
asked
adams
his
voice
heavy
with
sarcasm
i
think
so
replied
bob
let
s
have
it
hardly
solve
it
in
your
own
way
remember
that
i
m
working
with
my
uncle
on
this
case
you
have
the
invaluable
help
of
that
s
enough
of
smart
cracks
like
that
replied
adams
his
face
flushing
a
little
i
want
to
know
what
jacobs
i
m
making
my
report
direct
to
edgar
you
ll
have
to
get
it
from
with
that
bob
left
the
room
and
went
directly
to
the
office
of
the
federal
chief
lieutenant
gibbons
trailing
at
his
heels
waldo
edgar
listened
intently
while
bob
recounted
what
jacobs
had
told
him
i
rather
sensed
what
his
story
would
be
mused
the
chief
investigator
don
t
you
believe
it
asked
bob
yes
every
word
of
it
just
another
case
of
an
older
and
bullying
brother
taking
advantage
of
a
weaker
one
it
looks
like
jacobs
has
supplied
us
with
the
key
information
we
have
been
groping
for
good
work
i
m
afraid
i
don
t
deserve
any
congratulations
adams
turned
up
jacobs
as
a
true
enough
but
jacobs
would
never
have
talked
for
adams
or
any
of
the
rest
of
us
the
important
thing
is
that
he
did
talk
to
you
now
what
are
you
planning
bob
told
of
the
letter
from
maryland
and
of
his
orders
to
the
building
superintendent
the
postmark
on
that
letter
should
give
us
a
clue
to
where
the
gang
took
my
uncle
he
said
there
isn
t
much
chance
of
finding
it
but
it
s
worth
the
time
and
waldo
edgar
s
eyes
brightened
you
re
going
to
do
my
boy
it
s
things
like
that
that
count
you
never
can
tell
when
even
the
tiniest
slip
of
paper
is
going
to
give
you
the
key
to
the
case
you
re
working
the
chief
agent
turned
to
lieutenant
gibbons
you
re
staying
on
the
case
with
bob
he
asked
i
m
going
to
try
and
keep
up
with
him
smiled
the
intelligence
officer
splendid
then
we
ll
expect
your
uncle
and
the
missing
radio
paper
within
the
next
hours
chapter
xxviii
waste
paper
there
was
a
real
feeling
of
hope
in
bob
s
heart
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
department
of
justice
building
with
lieutenant
gibbons
at
his
side
things
are
going
to
move
fast
from
now
on
predicted
the
lieutenant
by
the
way
bob
aren
t
you
a
little
young
to
be
a
federal
agent
i
m
not
a
agent
explained
bob
when
my
uncle
was
assigned
to
this
case
and
it
looked
like
some
valuable
information
might
be
gained
by
an
inside
man
in
our
office
i
was
delegated
to
help
him
and
given
papers
as
a
provisional
agent
if
i
make
good
on
this
case
i
may
get
into
the
service
permanently
even
though
i
m
a
little
i
think
you
re
going
in
with
a
rush
and
i
know
you
re
going
to
make
good
even
though
edgar
gave
you
a
pretty
short
time
when
he
said
you
d
have
the
case
solved
within
that
s
what
scares
me
confessed
bob
but
i
ve
got
to
find
my
uncle
once
he
s
safe
i
ll
start
worrying
about
the
radio
when
you
find
him
you
ll
recover
the
radio
secret
predicted
the
intelligence
officer
fifteen
minutes
of
fast
driving
in
a
taxi
took
them
to
the
apartment
where
arthur
jacobs
resided
the
building
superintendent
curious
and
somewhat
worried
over
bob
s
telephoned
orders
was
waiting
at
the
door
to
meet
them
bob
identified
himself
and
the
superintendent
admitted
them
to
the
building
taking
them
into
the
basement
where
an
incinerator
bulked
in
the
background
beside
it
were
a
number
of
bales
of
paper
we
ve
been
baling
and
selling
the
waste
paper
he
explained
but
i
can
t
tell
you
in
what
bale
the
paper
from
the
fourth
floor
where
jacobs
lives
can
be
found
it
s
a
good
thing
you
phoned
we
were
going
to
have
this
trucked
out
sometime
during
the
bob
looked
at
the
bales
and
a
feeling
of
dismay
crept
into
his
heart
all
he
wanted
was
one
small
slip
of
there
were
literally
hundreds
of
pieces
of
paper
in
each
one
of
the
bales
he
turned
to
lieutenant
gibbons
the
intelligence
officer
grinned
looks
like
we
re
in
for
it
better
get
off
your
coat
bob
and
we
ll
start
on
the
first
you
mean
you
want
to
open
up
all
those
bales
demanded
the
building
superintendent
that
s
right
nodded
the
intelligence
officer
we
not
only
want
to
but
we
re
going
to
do
it
get
some
snippers
and
cut
through
the
wires
on
this
he
indicated
the
huge
stack
of
paper
nearest
him
the
superintendent
snapped
on
additional
lights
and
grudgingly
cut
the
wires
on
the
first
bale
while
bob
took
off
his
coat
save
every
envelope
with
a
maryland
postmark
on
it
he
said
it
looked
like
an
endless
task
but
bob
and
the
lieutenant
squatting
on
their
heels
started
through
the
pile
of
paper
the
building
superintendent
after
watching
them
for
several
minutes
joined
in
the
hunt
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
they
had
found
four
letters
with
maryland
postmarks
on
them
but
none
of
them
addressed
to
arthur
jacobs
we
ve
got
to
have
more
help
decided
the
intelligence
officer
when
an
hour
had
slipped
away
and
they
had
gone
through
only
one
bale
he
went
to
a
telephone
and
called
the
department
of
justice
with
the
result
that
within
half
an
hour
six
other
agents
were
on
the
job
delving
through
the
growing
pile
of
papers
by
noon
they
had
examined
every
scrap
of
paper
from
five
bales
and
their
arms
and
backs
were
aching
sharply
i
m
dizzy
confessed
the
intelligence
officer
when
they
finally
stopped
for
lunch
leaving
one
of
the
agents
to
guard
the
bales
in
the
basement
the
others
went
to
a
nearby
restaurant
lunch
was
eaten
quickly
and
with
a
minimum
of
talk
for
every
one
of
them
knew
that
perhaps
a
man
s
life
hinged
on
the
quickness
with
which
they
could
find
the
envelope
they
carried
a
tray
of
lunch
back
to
the
agent
who
had
been
left
on
guard
and
plunged
once
more
into
the
mountainous
task
which
still
faced
them
the
early
hours
of
the
afternoon
slipped
away
bale
after
bale
of
paper
was
scanned
with
care
and
bob
felt
his
hopes
sinking
another
bale
was
finished
and
one
more
pulled
down
and
clipped
open
he
knelt
down
again
and
picked
up
a
handful
of
waste
paper
an
envelope
drew
his
attention
but
it
was
for
another
resident
on
the
floor
on
which
the
filing
chief
lived
lieutenant
gibbons
whose
lanky
form
was
almost
doubled
in
a
knot
from
the
hours
of
bending
down
and
looking
at
slips
of
paper
suddenly
straightened
up
with
a
triumphant
cry
here
s
the
letter
he
cried
waving
a
badly
torn
envelope
the
federal
men
dropping
the
paper
they
had
been
sorting
rushed
to
his
side
bob
was
the
first
to
see
the
postmark
on
the
envelope
it
was
marked
from
rubio
maryland
and
was
addressed
to
arthur
jacobs
the
handwriting
on
the
envelope
was
large
and
heavy
and
the
pen
which
had
been
used
was
none
too
good
for
it
had
dropped
ink
in
two
places
on
the
envelope
bob
felt
his
heart
leap
this
was
the
clue
they
had
sought
for
so
many
weary
hours
in
the
litter
of
paper
in
the
basement
how
far
is
it
to
rubio
bob
asked
the
intelligence
officer
i
m
not
sure
that
i
even
know
what
part
of
maryland
it
s
in
but
i
believe
if
we
go
by
plane
we
should
be
there
in
an
then
we
ll
go
by
plane
decided
bob
just
how
he
could
obtain
a
plane
was
a
question
he
couldn
t
have
answered
at
the
moment
but
he
was
determined
to
make
the
trip
with
the
least
possible
loss
of
time
for
he
felt
that
either
in
rubio
or
near
it
he
would
find
the
solution
to
the
mystery
chapter
xxix
into
the
air
bob
and
lieutenant
gibbons
left
the
other
federal
agents
at
the
apartment
building
to
help
the
superintendent
clean
up
the
litter
of
paper
they
had
strewn
about
the
basement
while
they
hastened
back
to
the
department
of
justice
building
waldo
edgar
himself
was
waiting
for
their
report
and
he
smiled
contentedly
when
he
heard
it
you
re
on
the
right
track
bob
follow
it
hard
and
don
t
let
a
single
trick
get
away
from
you
how
are
you
going
to
rubio
bob
turned
to
a
wall
map
which
showed
the
entire
state
of
maryland
as
lieutenant
gibbons
had
surmised
rubio
was
on
the
east
shore
a
tiny
dot
of
a
town
well
isolated
from
any
of
the
other
shore
villages
that
s
a
desolate
stretch
said
the
chief
you
may
need
help
in
rounding
up
this
we
ll
try
it
alone
said
bob
if
we
find
them
we
can
send
in
a
call
for
assistance
can
you
arrange
for
us
to
fly
there
the
chief
of
the
division
of
investigation
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
just
three
o
clock
a
plane
will
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
at
antacostia
he
said
make
sure
that
you
are
well
armed
and
don
t
take
unnecessary
risks
understand
yes
sir
replied
bob
then
start
for
antacostia
at
once
you
re
going
too
lieutenant
i
wouldn
t
miss
this
replied
the
intelligence
officer
besides
we
have
a
considerable
stake
in
this
splendid
but
don
t
let
bob
take
any
needless
risks
i
m
counting
on
his
developing
into
one
of
my
aces
one
of
these
bob
s
temperature
rose
about
three
degrees
and
he
looked
at
the
federal
chief
to
see
if
he
was
joking
but
waldo
edgar
was
serious
looks
to
me
like
you
re
making
headway
rapidly
said
lieutenant
gibbons
as
they
left
the
department
of
justice
building
you
carrying
a
gun
he
asked
bob
patted
his
coat
pocket
i
ve
got
a
special
with
an
extra
clip
of
cartridges
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
a
trip
like
let
s
hope
so
said
the
intelligence
officer
when
they
reached
antacostia
a
cabin
plane
a
navy
ship
was
out
on
the
ramp
waiting
for
them
it
was
an
amphibian
and
while
they
were
paying
the
driver
of
their
cab
the
pilot
started
the
motor
with
a
roar
that
shook
the
ground
an
officer
ran
toward
them
which
one
of
you
is
bob
houston
he
asked
bob
stepped
forward
you
re
wanted
on
the
phone
at
once
he
said
step
on
it
bob
we
re
ready
to
go
warned
lieutenant
gibbons
bob
ran
toward
the
administration
building
and
a
clerk
there
handed
him
a
telephone
bob
recognized
instantly
the
voice
of
the
chief
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
waldo
edgar
usually
so
calm
was
deeply
moved
bob
get
to
rubio
with
all
possible
speed
we
ve
just
had
reports
that
an
unknown
yet
tremendously
powerful
radio
station
has
just
come
on
the
air
the
department
of
commerce
has
had
radio
direction
finders
on
it
for
the
last
ten
minutes
and
they
report
that
the
station
must
be
on
the
east
shore
of
maryland
probably
near
rubio
they
re
throwing
on
extra
power
on
their
experimental
station
here
to
gum
up
the
sending
from
this
unknown
outfit
i
m
afraid
they
re
trying
to
get
the
secret
of
the
plane
out
of
the
country
in
this
we
re
all
ready
to
go
the
plane
s
on
the
ramp
now
with
the
motor
then
hurry
let
me
know
the
minute
you
land
at
rubio
and
i
can
send
more
information
i
m
starting
agents
out
of
baltimore
by
motor
and
i
ll
send
another
plane
with
men
within
the
hour
good
bob
turned
and
raced
toward
the
waiting
plane
what
news
asked
lieutenant
gibbons
tell
you
when
we
re
in
the
air
replied
bob
they
climbed
into
the
cabin
and
were
no
sooner
seated
than
the
ship
started
rolling
across
the
field
almost
before
they
knew
it
the
ground
was
dropping
away
and
they
were
headed
for
the
east
shore
of
maryland
chapter
xxx
on
the
east
shore
the
air
that
fall
afternoon
was
clear
and
the
entire
panorama
of
the
city
of
washington
spread
out
below
them
but
bob
s
thoughts
were
not
on
the
beauties
of
the
afternoon
or
of
the
flight
his
mind
was
centered
far
ahead
on
the
east
shore
village
of
rubio
and
what
he
might
learn
there
the
cabin
was
well
insulated
so
bob
and
lieutenant
gibbons
could
converse
in
comparative
ease
what
did
edgar
have
to
say
asked
the
intelligence
officer
he
s
afraid
the
gang
is
trying
to
get
the
secret
radio
information
out
of
the
country
by
using
an
unlicensed
station
which
has
just
started
broadcasting
from
somewhere
along
the
east
shore
of
lieutenant
gibbons
whistled
what
s
he
doing
about
it
federal
agents
are
being
sent
from
baltimore
by
motor
and
another
plane
is
to
follow
us
within
a
few
minutes
the
department
of
commerce
believes
the
station
is
near
rubio
and
they
re
trying
to
gum
up
the
broadcast
as
much
as
possible
oh
it
all
clicks
beautifully
my
uncle
was
taken
down
the
river
in
a
fast
boat
and
landed
somewhere
near
rubio
he
had
the
paper
they
desired
and
now
they
are
trying
to
send
the
information
someplace
in
europe
by
using
this
powerful
but
unlicensed
sounds
logical
agreed
the
lieutenant
looks
like
we
re
going
to
have
some
busy
hours
ahead
of
us
made
any
plans
yet
bob
shook
his
head
i
haven
t
thought
any
beyond
getting
to
rubio
as
fast
as
we
can
and
trying
to
learn
there
whether
a
boat
like
the
one
which
slipped
out
of
the
tidal
basin
last
night
has
been
sighted
think
we
can
swing
it
alone
or
are
you
going
to
wait
for
the
other
agents
to
catch
up
with
us
there
was
no
hesitation
in
bob
s
reply
we
re
going
on
as
rapidly
as
we
can
every
minute
counts
now
we
may
run
straight
into
a
whole
kettle
of
trouble
but
we
ll
have
to
handle
it
in
some
they
lapsed
into
silence
as
the
sturdy
amphibian
sped
out
over
chesapeake
bay
fishing
boats
could
be
seen
below
and
several
freighters
bound
for
baltimore
churned
up
a
white
wake
in
the
blue
of
the
bay
it
was
indeed
a
calm
and
peaceful
afternoon
but
bob
s
mind
was
anything
but
peaceful
or
calm
then
they
were
over
maryland
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
uneven
line
of
the
east
shore
was
visible
the
pilot
in
his
cockpit
up
ahead
was
scanning
the
ground
intently
the
ship
veered
a
little
to
the
right
and
they
circled
over
a
sprawling
village
before
which
a
broad
sandy
beach
broke
the
gentle
swell
of
the
atlantic
half
a
mile
from
the
village
proper
was
a
sheltered
cove
with
a
score
of
small
fishing
wharfs
it
was
toward
this
that
the
pilot
of
the
amphibian
nosed
his
craft
as
they
swung
over
the
cove
bob
could
see
the
upturned
faces
of
fishermen
as
they
stared
at
the
unexpected
visitor
bob
looked
at
the
boats
in
the
cove
with
extreme
care
but
none
of
them
were
unusual
and
none
appeared
capable
of
great
speed
the
amphibian
smacked
the
water
and
spray
flew
out
on
both
sides
as
they
slowed
down
and
taxied
in
toward
the
shore
the
pilot
cut
the
engine
when
they
were
near
a
low
wharf
and
dropped
a
light
anchor
a
friendly
fisherman
put
out
in
a
dory
and
pulled
alongside
the
plane
any
trouble
he
asked
not
yet
replied
lieutenant
gibbons
but
we
re
looking
for
a
black
speed
boat
it
s
been
described
as
about
feet
long
and
capable
of
miles
an
hour
it
s
a
cabin
boat
with
an
antennae
above
the
cabin
ever
seen
anything
like
it
around
here
bob
watching
the
fisherman
closely
thought
he
detected
a
slight
narrowing
of
the
other
s
eyes
but
he
knew
that
the
men
of
the
east
shore
were
by
nature
extremely
cautious
don
t
know
as
i
ve
seen
just
that
boat
replied
the
fisherman
but
there
s
a
good
many
crafts
slip
around
the
coves
this
boat
would
have
come
in
this
better
climb
in
we
ll
ask
some
of
the
other
bob
and
the
intelligence
officer
seated
themselves
in
the
dory
and
were
quickly
put
ashore
where
a
little
group
gathered
about
them
the
man
who
had
brought
them
ashore
acted
as
spokesman
these
fellows
are
looking
for
a
speedboat
that
might
have
come
around
here
this
morning
anybody
seen
anything
of
such
a
craft
there
was
no
immediate
reply
and
bob
could
see
doubt
as
to
the
wisdom
of
answering
the
question
in
the
eyes
of
a
number
of
the
men
it
was
then
that
he
decided
to
tell
them
the
importance
of
their
visit
he
drew
out
his
billfold
and
handed
the
nearest
man
his
identification
card
we
re
federal
officers
he
explained
and
we
re
looking
for
a
man
who
was
kidnaped
last
night
in
washington
in
a
speedboat
and
brought
somewhere
near
rubio
if
you
can
give
us
any
information
it
may
save
a
man
s
the
entire
attitude
of
the
group
changed
and
a
young
man
who
had
been
in
the
background
stepped
forward
i
saw
such
a
boat
just
about
he
said
it
was
coming
up
from
the
south
and
coming
fast
maybe
forty
an
hour
but
i
didn
t
see
it
put
in
any
a
radio
in
one
of
the
fishing
shacks
screeched
as
though
in
agony
and
the
owner
of
the
set
hurried
away
to
tune
it
down
somebody
ought
to
break
that
thing
up
it
s
been
doing
that
all
afternoon
grunted
another
fisherman
did
it
work
all
right
before
asked
bob
sure
but
this
afternoon
something
went
wrong
and
we
can
t
get
bob
knew
then
that
the
end
of
the
trail
was
nearing
tell
me
this
are
there
any
old
estates
near
here
which
have
been
recently
occupied
the
owner
of
the
radio
who
had
shut
it
off
rejoined
the
group
in
time
to
hear
bob
s
question
and
it
was
he
who
replied
there
s
the
old
haskins
place
about
five
miles
up
the
shore
he
said
someone
s
been
around
there
for
the
last
month
or
so
i
went
up
one
day
to
try
and
sell
some
provisions
but
they
ordered
me
could
this
speedboat
have
been
bound
for
the
haskins
place
asked
bob
aiming
his
question
at
the
young
fisherman
who
had
told
him
about
the
boat
sure
it
was
going
up
the
shore
but
i
ve
never
seen
that
boat
around
here
bob
turned
to
lieutenant
gibbons
looks
to
me
like
the
haskins
place
is
our
goal
let
s
reconnoiter
it
in
the
the
sooner
the
better
agreed
the
intelligence
officer
bob
swung
back
to
the
fishermen
federal
agents
are
coming
in
here
from
baltimore
by
car
and
from
washington
by
plane
if
they
arrive
before
we
return
direct
them
to
the
haskins
chapter
xxxi
the
chase
ends
with
its
motor
on
full
the
amphibian
flashed
across
the
cove
and
wheeled
into
the
air
bob
felt
that
they
were
on
the
last
leg
of
their
hunt
and
he
sensed
a
tenseness
of
his
whole
body
that
was
unsettling
lieutenant
gibbons
realized
how
bob
felt
and
he
leaned
over
and
spoke
to
the
young
federal
agent
let
your
nerves
loosen
up
a
little
and
keep
your
head
when
we
get
on
the
ground
if
we
get
in
a
jam
use
your
gun
only
as
a
last
resort
remember
that
help
will
be
along
the
intelligence
officer
took
out
his
own
automatic
and
examined
it
making
sure
that
the
firing
mechanism
was
working
perfectly
bob
did
likewise
and
shifted
the
gun
into
his
coat
pocket
he
knew
that
with
the
gun
there
he
could
shoot
through
his
pocket
if
necessary
the
village
of
rubio
dropped
behind
them
and
a
desolate
stretch
of
shore
unfolded
before
their
eyes
lieutenant
gibbons
was
the
first
to
sight
the
haskins
place
a
rambling
old
structure
well
out
on
a
neck
of
land
that
projected
into
the
atlantic
he
signalled
to
the
pilot
that
this
was
their
destination
and
the
naval
airman
banked
the
amphibian
gracefully
the
plane
dropped
low
flying
not
more
than
a
hundred
feet
above
the
shore
the
expansive
old
house
which
had
several
long
wings
was
badly
in
need
of
paint
as
were
the
outbuildings
clustered
to
the
rear
a
long
low
boathouse
was
built
as
a
part
of
the
pier
and
one
door
was
closed
but
as
the
plane
flashed
by
bob
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
black
motorboat
and
his
heart
leaped
he
seized
lieutenant
gibbons
arm
i
saw
a
boat
in
the
shed
cried
bob
let
s
get
down
as
soon
as
but
already
the
flyer
was
dropping
the
amphibian
low
they
spattered
down
on
the
water
and
their
speed
dropped
off
as
they
neared
the
old
wharf
bob
watched
the
house
closely
for
some
sign
of
life
the
windows
many
of
them
broken
betrayed
no
movements
from
all
outward
appearances
the
house
had
not
been
occupied
in
years
the
amphibian
now
less
than
yards
from
the
beach
lost
headway
and
drifted
looks
like
some
bad
rocks
ahead
said
the
pilot
i
don
t
dare
get
any
closer
you
ll
have
to
swim
if
you
want
to
land
here
unless
i
taxi
out
and
down
a
ways
it
looked
better
further
but
bob
had
no
intention
of
wasting
any
more
time
i
m
going
ashore
he
told
lieutenant
gibbons
you
can
stay
here
and
see
if
anything
before
the
intelligence
officer
could
protest
bob
eased
himself
out
of
the
cabin
and
started
swimming
for
shore
in
a
few
yards
he
was
able
to
touch
bottom
but
just
as
he
straightened
up
there
was
a
sharp
puff
from
one
of
the
lower
windows
of
the
old
house
and
a
bullet
ricocheted
along
the
water
bob
acting
by
instinct
ducked
and
started
swimming
under
water
he
should
have
been
greatly
alarmed
but
instead
he
felt
a
strange
exultation
for
the
firing
of
that
shot
had
told
him
what
he
wanted
to
was
at
the
end
of
the
trail
the
young
federal
agent
came
up
for
air
and
as
soon
as
his
head
appeared
three
shots
sounded
in
rapid
succession
each
fired
from
different
windows
in
the
house
two
of
the
bullets
went
wide
of
their
mark
but
the
third
splashed
water
in
bob
s
eyes
before
he
ducked
again
he
heard
lieutenant
gibbons
firing
back
and
then
another
gun
joined
in
the
battle
and
bob
knew
that
the
naval
flyer
had
taken
a
hand
in
the
party
swimming
with
a
powerful
stroke
bob
shot
along
under
water
when
he
came
up
this
time
he
was
in
the
shelter
of
the
boathouse
he
was
able
to
stand
erect
and
he
waved
back
to
lieutenant
gibbons
the
firing
from
the
house
had
suddenly
ceased
and
bob
made
his
way
alongside
the
squat
powerful
speedboat
he
climbed
into
the
craft
and
with
several
well
aimed
blows
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
disabled
the
ignition
apparatus
at
least
the
kidnapers
would
not
escape
in
the
boat
from
some
place
behind
the
house
the
sound
of
an
automobile
exhaust
roared
out
and
bob
leaped
to
the
door
of
the
boathouse
a
car
wheeled
around
the
far
corner
of
the
house
and
he
saw
three
men
inside
two
in
front
and
one
in
the
rear
it
was
the
first
time
bob
had
ever
fired
a
gun
with
a
human
being
as
a
target
but
he
fired
rapidly
from
the
automatic
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
whole
volley
of
bullets
issued
from
the
weapon
in
his
hands
then
the
gun
was
silent
and
before
he
could
get
the
other
clip
from
his
pocket
the
car
had
disappeared
bob
started
running
for
the
house
pausing
only
once
when
a
cry
from
lieutenant
gibbons
caused
him
to
turn
his
head
the
intelligence
officer
was
wading
ashore
and
motioning
for
bob
to
wait
for
him
but
bob
had
more
pressing
duties
the
front
door
of
the
house
was
half
open
and
bob
charged
through
the
interior
was
dusty
and
unkempt
although
there
were
some
signs
that
an
effort
had
been
made
to
live
in
two
of
the
front
rooms
lieutenant
gibbons
pounded
up
the
front
steps
and
burst
into
the
hallway
he
joined
bob
and
together
they
resumed
the
frantic
search
of
the
house
the
first
floor
was
combed
room
for
room
and
closet
by
closet
and
it
was
not
until
they
reached
a
shed
at
the
back
of
the
house
that
they
found
what
they
were
seeking
there
laying
on
a
roll
of
dirty
bedding
was
merritt
hughes
bound
gagged
and
with
a
red
welt
along
one
side
of
his
head
bob
a
cry
of
joy
at
finding
his
uncle
on
his
lips
bent
down
to
untie
the
gag
while
lieutenant
gibbons
slashed
at
the
rope
which
fastened
the
federal
agent
s
wrists
and
ankles
together
they
helped
merritt
hughes
to
his
feet
his
tongue
was
badly
swollen
from
the
gag
but
he
managed
to
say
a
few
words
did
they
get
away
he
asked
slowly
yes
but
i
don
t
think
they
ll
get
far
agents
are
on
their
way
from
baltimore
and
washington
said
bob
how
about
their
radio
the
department
of
commerce
heard
them
come
on
the
air
and
gummed
up
their
broadcasts
replied
bob
lieutenant
gibbons
who
had
gone
in
search
of
water
returned
with
a
tin
cup
and
merritt
hughes
drank
it
with
relish
taking
slow
deep
draughts
of
the
refreshing
liquid
then
he
bathed
his
face
and
hands
and
felt
much
refreshed
he
looked
quizzically
at
bob
and
the
lieutenant
you
fellows
may
catch
pneumonia
running
around
here
in
wet
clothes
he
warned
what
happened
to
your
head
demanded
the
lieutenant
they
creased
me
with
a
bullet
during
the
scrap
back
in
washington
last
night
replied
the
federal
agent
grimly
i
want
you
to
see
their
he
led
them
to
the
top
floor
of
the
old
house
where
one
room
had
been
fitted
up
for
broadcasting
purposes
bob
knew
little
about
radio
but
he
could
tell
that
a
great
deal
of
money
had
been
expended
here
where
s
the
aerial
he
asked
they
used
an
underground
antennae
replied
his
uncle
lieutenant
gibbons
picked
up
a
heavy
chair
which
was
in
the
room
and
deliberately
smashed
the
delicate
equipment
i
guess
that
s
the
end
of
this
but
we
haven
t
recovered
the
radio
document
groaned
bob
i
rather
think
we
have
replied
the
lieutenant
pointing
from
a
window
to
a
cavalcade
of
cars
which
was
approaching
through
a
clearing
chapter
xxxii
federal
agent
the
scene
that
night
in
the
office
of
the
chief
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
was
one
that
would
remain
stamped
forever
in
bob
s
memory
waldo
edgar
was
there
so
was
bob
s
uncle
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
were
tully
ross
and
condon
adams
and
in
the
background
lieutenant
gibbons
chuckled
occasionally
it
was
a
brief
session
with
waldo
edgar
doing
most
of
the
talking
in
that
close
clipped
manner
of
speech
of
his
which
inspired
his
own
agents
and
instilled
fear
in
the
hearts
of
the
men
he
was
pursuing
the
reports
you
have
turned
over
to
me
tonight
are
highly
gratifying
he
said
and
i
think
we
can
call
this
case
completed
while
most
of
the
honor
of
the
final
catch
goes
to
bob
houston
condon
adams
and
tully
ross
deserve
credit
for
uncovering
that
vital
clue
in
the
fireplace
of
arthur
jacobs
the
federal
chief
shuffled
through
some
papers
on
his
desk
all
of
the
men
involved
in
the
case
have
been
apprehended
including
fritz
jacobs
who
appeared
to
be
the
ringleader
their
radio
station
has
been
destroyed
and
they
were
unable
to
make
use
of
the
information
which
they
had
for
nearly
hours
you
may
be
sure
that
their
punishment
will
be
swift
and
sure
as
for
arthur
jacobs
i
am
inclined
to
feel
sorry
for
him
for
his
record
in
the
government
service
up
to
this
time
had
been
excellent
and
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
to
help
then
waldo
edgar
turned
to
tully
ross
as
a
result
of
your
work
on
this
case
i
am
pleased
to
be
able
to
tell
you
that
you
are
now
a
full
fledged
federal
the
chief
of
the
bureau
of

then
faced
bob
and
he
smiled
warmly
as
he
spoke
to
you
bob
i
extend
my
most
sincere
congratulations
you
were
under
a
great
strain
yet
you

and
when
the
showdown

you
were
in
there
fighting

t

when
anything

pleased
me
more
than
to

as
a
federal
agent

re
young
but
i
predict
that

a
long
ways
in
the
federal
in
spite
of
himself
tears
welled
into
bob

eyes
for

was
overflowing
with
happiness

waldo
edgar
chuckled
you
d
better
rest
a
day
or
two
from
this
one
there
will
be
plenty
for
you
he
was
indeed
a
wise
prophet
for
in
less
than
hours

was
to
get
the
call
that
was
to
send
him
out
on
the
famous
jewel
mystery
about
which
you
will
learn
in
