the
life
of
lord
byron
author
introduction
my
present
task
is
one
of
considerable
difficulty
but
i
have
long
had
a
notion
that
some
time
or
another
it
would
fall
to
my
lot
to
perform
it
i
approach
it
therefore
without
apprehension
entirely
in
consequence
of
having
determined
to
my
own
satisfaction
the
manner
in
which
the
biography
of
so
singular
and
so
richly
endowed
a
character
as
that
of
the
late
lord
byron
should
be
treated
but
still
with
no
small
degree
of
diffidence
for
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
determining
a
rule
for
one
self
and
producing
according
to
that
rule
a
work
which
shall
please
the
public
it
has
happened
both
with
regard
to
the
man
and
the
poet
that
from
the
first
time
his
name
came
before
the
public
there
has
been
a
vehement
and
continual
controversy
concerning
him
and
the
chief
difficulties
of
the
task
arise
out
of
the
heat
with
which
the
adverse
parties
have
maintained
their
respective
opinions
the
circumstances
in
which
he
was
placed
until
his
accession
to
the
title
and
estates
of
his
ancestors
were
not
such
as
to
prepare
a
boy
that
would
be
father
to
a
prudent
or
judicious
man
nor
according
to
the
history
of
his
family
was
his
blood
without
a
taint
of
sullenness
which
disqualified
him
from
conciliating
the
good
opinion
of
those
whom
his
innate
superiority
must
have
often
prompted
him
to
desire
for
friends
he
was
branded
moreover
with
a
personal
deformity
and
the
grudge
against
nature
for
inflicting
this
defect
not
only
deeply
disturbed
his
happiness
but
so
generally
affected
his
feelings
as
to
embitter
them
with
a
vindictive
sentiment
so
strong
as
at
times
to
exhibit
the
disagreeable
energy
of
misanthropy
this
was
not
all
he
enjoyed
high
rank
and
was
conscious
of
possessing
great
talents
but
his
fortune
was
inadequate
to
his
desires
and
his
talents
were
not
of
an
order
to
redeem
the
deficiencies
of
fortune
it
likewise
so
happened
that
while
indulged
by
his
only
friend
his
mother
to
an
excess
that
impaired
the
manliness
of
his
character
her
conduct
was
such
as
in
no
degree
to
merit
the
affection
which
her
wayward
fondness
inspired
it
is
impossible
to
reflect
on
the
boyhood
of
byron
without
regret
there
is
not
one
point
in
it
all
which
could
otherwise
than
with
pain
have
affected
a
young
mind
of
sensibility
his
works
bear
testimony
that
while
his
memory
retained
the
impressions
of
early
youth
fresh
and
unfaded
there
was
a
gloom
and
shadow
upon
them
which
proved
how
little
they
had
been
really
joyous
the
riper
years
of
one
so
truly
the
nursling
of
pride
poverty
and
pain
could
only
be
inconsistent
wild
and
impassioned
even
had
his
temperament
been
moderate
and
well
disciplined
but
when
it
is
considered
that
in
addition
to
all
the
awful
influences
of
these
fatalities
for
they
can
receive
no
lighter
name
he
possessed
an
imagination
of
unbounded
capacity
was
inflamed
with
those
indescribable
feelings
which
constitute
in
the
opinion
of
many
the
very
elements
of
genius
fearfully
quick
in
the
discernment
of
the
darker
qualities
of
character
and
surrounded
by
temptation
his
career
ceases
to
surprise
it
would
have
been
more
wonderful
had
he
proved
an
amiable
and
man
than
the
questionable
and
extraordinary
being
who
has
alike
provoked
the
malice
and
interested
the
admiration
of
the
world
posterity
while
acknowledging
the
eminence
of
his
endowments
and
lamenting
the
habits
which
his
unhappy
circumstances
induced
will
regard
it
as
a
curious
phenomenon
in
the
fortunes
of
the
individual
that
the
progress
of
his
fame
as
a
poet
should
have
been
so
similar
to
his
history
as
a
man
his
first
attempts
though
displaying
both
originality
and
power
were
received
with
a
contemptuous
disdain
as
cold
and
repulsive
as
the
penury
and
neglect
which
blighted
the
budding
of
his
youth
the
unjust
ridicule
in
the
review
of
his
first
poems
excited
in
his
spirit
a
discontent
as
inveterate
as
the
feeling
which
sprung
from
his
deformity
it
affected
more
or
less
all
his
conceptions
to
such
a
degree
that
he
may
be
said
to
have
hated
the
age
which
had
joined
in
the
derision
as
he
cherished
an
antipathy
against
those
persons
who
looked
curiously
at
his
foot
childe
harold
the
most
triumphant
of
his
works
was
produced
when
the
world
was
kindliest
disposed
to
set
a
just
value
on
his
talents
and
his
latter
productions
in
which
the
faults
of
his
taste
appear
the
broadest
were
written
when
his
errors
as
a
man
were
harshest
in
the
public
voice
these
allusions
to
the
incidents
of
a
life
full
of
contrarieties
and
a
character
so
strange
as
to
be
almost
mysterious
sufficiently
show
the
difficulties
of
the
task
i
have
undertaken
but
the
course
i
intend
to
pursue
will
relieve
me
from
the
necessity
of
entering
in
any
particular
manner
upon
those
debatable
points
of
his
personal
conduct
which
have
been
so
much
discussed
i
shall
consider
him
if
i
can
as
his
character
will
be
estimated
when
contemporary
surmises
are
forgotten
and
when
the
monument
he
has
raised
to
himself
is
contemplated
for
its
beauty
and
magnificence
without
suggesting
recollections
of
the
eccentricities

with
william
the
conqueror
and
from
that
era
they
have
continued
to
be
reckoned
among
the
eminent
families
of
the
kingdom
under
the
names
of
buron
and
biron
it
was
not
until
the
reign
of
henry
ii
that
they
began
to
call
themselves
byron
or
de
byron
although
for
upwards
of
seven
hundred
years
distinguished
for
the
extent
of
their
possessions
it
docs
not
appear
that
before
the
time
of
charles
they
ranked
very
highly
among
the
heroic
families
of
the
kingdom
erneis
and
ralph
were
the
companions
of
the
conqueror
but
antiquaries
and
genealogists
have
not
determined
in
what
relation
they
stood
to

to
have

more
considerable

he
resided
at

from

of

were
augmented
by
the
addition
of
the
manor
of
rochdale
in
lancashire
on
what
account
this
new
grant
was
given
has
not
been
ascertained
nor
is
it
of
importance
that
it
should
be
in
the
wars
of
the
three

the

with
some
distinction
and
they
were
also
of
note
in
the
time
of

joined
henry
vii
on
his
landing
at
milford
and
fought
gallantly
at

he
was
afterwards
appointed
constable

in
the
county

nottingham
together
with
the

that
period

and
continued
so
until
it
was
sold
by
the

and
his
other
possessions

became
obnoxious

in
consequence
ordered
by
the
commons
to
answer
at
the
bar
of
their
house
certain
charges
which
the
sectaries
alleged
against
him
but
he
refused
to
leave
his
post
without
the
king

upon
this
the
commons
applied
to
the

to
join

honours
on
the
death
of
his

in

service
and
became
a
lieutenant
under
admiral
balchen
in
the
year
he
was
made
master
of
the
staghounds
and
in
he
was
sent
to
the
tower
and
tried
before
the
house
of
peers
for
killing
his
relation
and
neighbour
mr
chaworth
in
a
duel
fought
at
the
star
and
garter
tavern
in
this
lord
william
was
naturally
boisterous
and
vindictive
it
appeared
in
evidence
that
he
insisted
on
fighting
with
mr
chaworth
in
the
room
where
the
quarrel
commenced
they
accordingly
fought
without
seconds
by
the
dim
light
of
a
single
candle
and
although
mr
chaworth
was
the
more
skilful
swordsman
of
the
two
he
received
a
mortal
wound
but
he
lived
long
enough
to
disclose
some
particulars
of
the
rencounter
which
induced
the
coroner
jury
to
return
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
and
lord
byron
was
tried
for
the
crime
the
trial
took
place
in
westminster
hall
and
the
public
curiosity
was
so
great
that
the
peers
tickets
of
admission
were
publicly
sold
for
six
guineas
each
it
lasted
two
days
and
at
the
conclusion
he
was
unanimously
pronounced
guilty
of
manslaughter
on
being
brought
up
for
judgment
he
pleaded
his
privilege
and
was
discharged
it
was
to
this
lord
that
the
poet
succeeded
for
he
died
without
leaving
issue
his
brother
the
grandfather
of
the
poet
was
the
celebrated
hardy
byron
or
as
the
sailors
called
him
foulweather
jack
whose
adventures
and
services
are
too
well
known
to
require
any
notice
here
he
married
the
daughter
of
john
trevannion
of
carhais
in
the
county
of
cornwall
by
whom
he
had
two
sons
and
three
daughters
john
the
eldest
and
the
father
of
the
poet
was
born
in
educated
at
westminster
school
and
afterwards
placed
in
the
guards
where
his
conduct
became
so
irregular
and
profligate
that
his
father
the
admiral
though
a
man
discarded
him
long
before
his
death
in
he
acquired
extraordinary
eclat
by
the
seduction
of
the
marchioness
of
caermarthen
under
circumstances
which
have
few
parallels
in
the
licentiousness
of
fashionable
life
the
meanness
with
which
he
obliged
his
wretched
victim
to
supply
him
with
money
would
have
been
disgraceful
to
the
basest
adulteries
of
the
cellar
or
garret
a
divorce
ensued
the
guilty
parties
married
but
within
two
years
after
such
was
the
brutal
and
vicious
conduct
of
captain
byron
that
the
lady
died
literally
of
a
broken
heart
after
having
given
birth
to
two
daughters
one
of
whom
still
survives
captain
byron
then
married
miss
catharine
gordon
of
gight
a
lady
of
honourable
descent
and
of
a
respectable
fortune
for
a
scottish
heiress
the
only
motive
which
this
don
juan
had
for
forming
the
connection
she
was
the
mother
of
the
poet
although
the
byrons
have
for
so
many
ages
been
among
the
eminent
families
of
the
realm
they
have
no
claim
to
the
distinction
which
the
poet
has
set
up
for
them
as
warriors
in
palestine
even
though
he
says
near
ascalon
john
of
horestan
slumbers
for
unless
this
refers
to
the
lord
of
horestan
who
was
one
of
the
hostages
for
the
ransom
of
richard
it
will
not
be
easy
to
determine
to
whom
he
alludes
and
it
is
possible
that
the
poet
has
no
other
authority
for
this
legend
than
the
tradition
which
he
found
connected
with
two
groups
of
heads
on
the
old
panels
of
newstead
yet
the
account
of
them
is
vague
and
conjectural
for
it
was
not
until
ages
after
the
crusades
that
the
abbey
came
into
the
possession
of
the
family
and
it
is
not
probable
that
the
figures
referred
to
any
transactions
in
palestine
in
which
the
byrons
were
engaged
if
they
were
put
up
by
the
byrons
at
all
they
were
probably
placed
in
their
present
situation
while
the
building
was
in
possession
of
the
churchmen
one
of
the
groups
consisting
of
a
female
and
two
saracens
with
eyes
earnestly
fixed
upon
her
may
have
been
the
old
favourite
ecclesiastical
story
of
susannah
and
the
elders
the
other
which
represents
a
saracen
with
a
european
female
between
him
and
a
christian
soldier
is
perhaps
an
ecclesiastical
allegory
descriptive
of
the
saracen
and
the
christian
warrior
contending
for
the
liberation
of
the
church
these
sort
of
allegorical
stories
were
common
among
monastic
ornaments
and
the
famous
legend
of
st
george
and
the
dragon
is
one
of
them
into
the
domestic
circumstances
of
captain
and
mrs
byron
it
would
be
impertinent
to
institute
any
particular
investigation
they
were
exactly
such
as
might
be
expected
from
the
sins
and
follies
of
the
most
profligate
libertine
of
the
age
the
fortune
of
mrs
byron
consisting
of
various
property
and
amounting
to
about
pounds
was
all
wasted
in
the
space
of
two
years
at
the
end
of
which
the
unfortunate
lady
found
herself
in
possession
of
only
pounds
per
annum
their
means
being
thus
exhausted
she
accompanied
her
husband
in
the
summer
of
to
france
whence
she
returned
to
england
at
the
close
of
the
year
and
on
the
of
january
gave
birth
in
holles
street
london
to
her
first
and
only
child
the
poet
the
name
of
gordon
was
added
to
that
of
his
family
in
compliance
with
a
condition
imposed
by
will
on
whomever
should

were
godfathers
to

in
the
year
mrs
byron
took
up
her
residence
in
aberdeen
where
she
was
soon
after
joined
by
captain
byron
with
whom
she
lived
in
lodgings
in
queen
street
but
their
reunion
was
comfortless
and
a
separation
soon
took
place
still
their
rupture
was
not
final
for
they
occasionally
visited
and
drank
tea
with
each
other
the
captain
also
paid
some
attention
to
the
boy
and
had
him
on
one
occasion
to
stay
with
him
for
a
night
when
he
proved
so
troublesome
that
he
was
sent
home
next
day
byron
himself
has
said
that
he
passed
his
boyhood
at
marlodge
near
aberdeen
but
the
statement
is
not
correct
he
visited
with
his
mother
occasionally
among
their
friends
and
among
other
places
passed
some
time
at
fetteresso
the
seat
of
his
godfather
colonel
duff
in
after
an
attack
of
the
scarlet
fever
he
passed
some
time
at
ballater
a
summer
resort
for
health
and
gaiety
about
forty
miles
up
the
dee
from
aberdeen
although
the
circumstances
of
mrs
byron
were
at
this
period
exceedingly
straitened
she
received
a
visit
from
her
husband
the
object
of
which
was
to
extort
more
money
and
he
was
so
far
successful
that
she
contrived
to
borrow
a
sum
which
enabled
him
to
proceed
to
valenciennes
where
in
the
following
year
he
died
greatly
to
her
relief
and
the
gratification
of
all
who
were
connected
with
him
by
her
advances
to
captain
byron
and
the
expenses
she
incurred
in
furnishing
the
flat
of
the
house
she
occupied
after
his
death
mrs
byron
fell
into
debt
to
the
amount
of
pounds
the
interest
on
which
reduced
her
income
to
pounds
but
much
to
her
credit
she
contrived
to
live
without
increasing
her
embarrassments
until
the
death
of
her
grandmother
when
she
received
pounds
a
sum
which
had
been
set
apart
for
the
old
gentlewoman
jointure
and
which
enabled
her
to
discharge
her
pecuniary
obligations
notwithstanding
the
manner
in
which
this
unfortunate
lady
was
treated
by
her
husband
she
always
entertained
for
him
a
strong
affection
insomuch
that
when
the
intelligence
of
his
death
arrived
her
grief
was
loud
and
vehement
she
was
indeed
a
woman
of
quick
feelings
and
strong
passions
and
probably
it
was
by
the
strength
and
sincerity
of
her
sensibility
that
she
retained
so
long
the
affection
of
her
son
towards
whom
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
her
love
was
unaffected
in
the
midst
of
the
neglect
and
penury
to
which
she
was
herself
subjected
she
bestowed
upon
him
all
the
care
the
love
and
watchfulness
of
the
tenderest
mother
in
his
fifth
year
on
the
of
november
she
sent
him
to
a
where
she
paid
about
five
shillings
a
quarter
the
common
rate
of
the
respectable
at
that
time
in
scotland
it
was
kept
by
a
mr
bowers
whom
byron
has
described
as
a
dapper
spruce
person
with
whom
he
made
no
progress
how
long
he
remained
with
mr
bowers
is
not
mentioned
but
by
the
of
the
school
it
was
at
least
twelve
months
for
on
the
of
november
of
the
following
year
there
is
an
entry
of
a
guinea
having
been
paid
for
him
from
this
school
he
was
removed
and
placed
with
a
mr
ross
one
of
the
ministers
of
the
city
churches
and
to
whom
he
formed
some
attachment
as
he
speaks
of
him
with
kindness
and
describes
him
as
a
devout
clever
little
man
of
mild
manners
and
painstaking
his
third
instructor
was
a
serious
saturnine
kind
young
man
named
paterson
the
son
of
a
shoemaker
but
a
good
scholar
and
a
rigid
presbyterian
it
is
somewhat
curious
in
the
record
which
byron
has
made
of
his
early
years
to
observe
the
constant
endeavour
with
which
he
the
descendant
of
such
a
limitless
pedigree
and
great
ancestors
attempts
to
magnify
the
condition
of
his
circumstances
paterson
attended
him
until
he
went
to
the
where
his
character
first
began
to
be
developed
and
his
schoolfellows
many
of
whom
are
alive
still
recollect
him
as
a
lively
and
boy
passionate
and
resentful
but
withal
affectionate
and
companionable
this
however
is
an
opinion
given
of
him
after
he
had
become
celebrated
for
a
very
different
impression
has
unquestionably
remained
among
some
who
carry
their
recollections
back
to
his
childhood
by
them
he
has
been
described
as

malignant
imp
was
often
spoken
of
for
his
pranks
by
the
worthy
housewives
of
the
neighbourhood

generally
disliked
for
the
deep
vindictive
anger
he
retained
against

to

death
of

early

impressions
and
traditions
before
i
proceed
to
the
regular
narrative
of
the
character
and
adventures
of
lord
byron
it
seems
necessary
to
consider
the
probable
effects
of
his
residence
during
his
boyhood
in
scotland
it
is
generally
agreed
that
while
a
schoolboy
in
aberdeen
he
evinced
a
lively
spirit
and
sharpness
enough
to
have
equalled
any
of
his
schoolfellows
had
he
given
sufficient
application
in
the
few
reminiscences
preserved
of
his
childhood
it
is
remarkable
that
he
appears
in
this
period
commonly
of
innocence
and
playfulness
rarely
to
have
evinced
any
symptom
of
generous
feeling
silent
rages
moody
sullenness
and
revenge
are
the
general
characteristics
of
his
conduct
as
a
boy
he
was
undoubtedly
delicately
susceptible
of
impressions
from
the
beauties
of
nature
for
he
retained
recollections
of
the
scenes
which
interested
his
childish
wonder
fresh
and
glowing
to
his
latest
days
nor
have
there
been
wanting
plausible
theories
to
ascribe
the
formation
of
his
poetical
character
to
the
contemplation
of
those
romantic
scenes
but
whoever
has
attended
to
the
influential
causes
of
character
will
reject
such
theories
as
shallow
and
betraying
great
ignorance
of
human
nature
genius
of
every
kind
belongs
to
some
innate
temperament
it
does
not
necessarily
imply
a
particular
bent
because
that
may
possibly
be
the
effect
of
circumstances
but
without
question
the
peculiar
quality
is
inborn
and
particular
to
the
individual
all
hear
and
see
much
alike
but
there
is
an
undefinable
though
wide
difference
between
the
ear
of
the
musician
or
the
eye
of
the
painter
compared
with
the
hearing
and
seeing
organs
of
ordinary
men
and
it
is
in
something
like
that
difference
in
which
genius
consists
genius
is
however
an
ingredient
of
mind
more
easily
described
by
its
effects
than
by
its
qualities
it
is
as
the
fragrance
independent
of
the
freshness
and
complexion
of
the
rose
as
the
light
on
the
cloud
as
the
bloom
on
the
cheek
of
beauty
of
which
the
possessor
is
unconscious
until
the
charm
has
been
seen
by
its
influence
on
others
it
is
the
internal
golden
flame
of
the
opal
a
something
which
may
be
abstracted
from
the
thing
in
which
it
appears
without
changing
the
quality
of
its
substance
its
form
or
its
affinities
i
am
not
therefore
disposed
to
consider
the
idle
and
reckless
childhood
of
byron
as
unfavourable
to
the
development
of
his
genius
but
on
the
contrary
inclined
to
think
that
the
indulgence
of
his
mother
leaving
him
so
much
to
the
accidents
of
undisciplined
impression
was
calculated
to
cherish
associations
which
rendered
them
in
the
maturity
of
his
powers
ingredients
of
spell
that
ruled
his
memory
it
is
singular
and
i
am
not
aware
it
has
been
before
noticed
that
with
all
his
tender
and
impassioned
apostrophes
to
beauty
and
love
byron
has
in
no
instance
not
even
in
the
freest
passages
of
don
juan
associated
either
the
one
or
the
other
with
sensual
images
the
extravagance
of
shakespeare
juliet
when
she
speaks
of
romeo
being
cut
after
his
death
into
stars
that
all
the
world
may
be
in
love
with
night
is
flame
and
ecstasy
compared
to
the
icy
metaphysical
glitter
of
byron
amorous
allusions
the
verses
beginning
with
she
walks
in
beauty
like
the
light
of
eastern
climes
and
starry
skies
are
a
perfect
example
of
what
i
have
conceived
of
his
bodiless
admiration
of
beauty
and
objectless
enthusiasm
of
love
the
sentiment
itself
is
unquestionably
in
the
highest
mood
of
the
intellectual
sense
of
beauty
the
simile
is
however
anything
but
such
an
image
as
the
beauty
of
woman
would
suggest
it
is
only
the
remembrance
of
some
impression
or
imagination
of
the
loveliness
of
a
twilight
applied
to
an
object
that
awakened
the
same
abstract
general
idea
of
beauty
the
fancy
which
could
conceive
in
its
passion
the
charms
of
a
female
to
be
like
the
glow
of
the
evening
or
the
general
effect
of
the
midnight
stars
must
have
been
enamoured
of
some
beautiful
abstraction
rather
than
aught
of
flesh
and
blood
poets
and
lovers
have
compared
the
complexion
of
their
mistresses
to
the
hues
of
the
morning
or
of
the
evening
and
their
eyes
to
the
dewdrops
and
the
stars
but
it
has
no
place
in
the
feelings
of
man
to
think
of
female
charms
in
the
sense
of
admiration
which
the
beauties
of
the
morning
or
the
evening
awaken
it
is
to
make
the
simile
the
principal
perhaps
however
it
may
be
as
well
to
defer
the
criticism
to
which
this
peculiar
characteristic
of
byron
amatory
effusions
gives
rise
until
we
shall
come
to
estimate
his
general
powers
as
a
poet
there
is
upon
the
subject
of
love
no
doubt
much
beautiful
composition
throughout
his
works
but
not
one
line
in
all
the
thousands
which
shows
a
sexual
feeling
of
female
attraction
all
is
vague
and
passionless
save
in
the
delicious
rhythm
of
the
verse
but
these
remarks
though
premature
as
criticisms
are
not
uncalled
for
here
even
while
we
are
speaking
of
a
child
not
more
than
ten
years
old
before
byron
had
attained
that
age
he
describes
himself
as
having
felt
the
passion
dante
is
said
as
early
as
nine
years
old
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
beatrice
alfieri
who
was
himself
precocious
in
the
passion
considered
such
early
sensibility
to
be
an
unerring
sign
of
a
soul
formed
for
the
fine
arts
and
canova
used
to
say
that
he
was
in
love
when
but
five
years
old
but
these
instances
however
prove
nothing
as
it
is
called
in
the
country
is
common
and
in
italy
it
may
arise
earlier
than
in
the
bleak
and
barren
regions
of
lochynagar
this
movement
of
juvenile
sentiment
is
not
however
love
that
strong
masculine
avidity
which
in
its
highest
excitement
is
unrestrained
by
the
laws
alike
of
god
and
man
in
truth
the
feeling
of
this
kind
of
love
is
the
very
reverse
of
the
irrepressible
passion
it
is
a
mean
shrinking
stealthy
awe
and
in
no
one
of
its
symptoms
at
least
in
none
of
those
which
byron
describes
has
it
the
slightest
resemblance
to
that
bold
energy
which
has
prompted
men
to
undertake
the
most
improbable
adventures
he
was
not
quite
eight
years
old
when
according
to
his
own
account
he
formed
an
impassioned
attachment
to
mary
duff
and
he
gives
the
following
account
of
his
recollection
of
her
nineteen
years
afterwards
i
have
been
thinking
lately
a
good
deal
of
mary
duff
how
very
odd
that
i
should
have
been
so
devotedly
fond
of
that
girl
at
an
age
when
i
could
neither
feel
passion
nor
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
and
the
effect
my
mother
used
always
to
rally
me
about
this
childish
amour
and
at
last
many
years
after
when
i
was
sixteen
she
told
me
one
day
byron
i
have
had
a
letter
from
edinburgh
and
your
old
sweetheart
mary
duff
is
married
to
mr
and
what
was
my
answer
i
really
can
not
explain
or
account
for
my
feelings
at
that
moment
but
they
nearly
threw
me
into
convulsions
and
alarmed
my
mother
so
much
that
after
i
grew
better
she
generally
avoided
the
subject
to
me
and
contented
herself
with
telling
it
to
all
her
acquaintance
but
was
this
agitation
the
effect
of
natural
feeling
or
of
something
in
the
manner
in
which
his
mother
may
have
told
the
news
he
proceeds
to
inquire
now
what
could
this
be
i
had
never
seen
her
since
her
mother
faux
pas
at
aberdeen
had
been
the
cause
of
her
removal
to
her
grandmother
at
banff
we
were
both
the
merest
children
i
had
and
have
been
attached
fifty
times
since
that
period
yet
i
recollect
all
we
said
to
each
other
all
our
caresses
her
features
my
restlessness
sleeplessness
my
tormenting
my
mother
maid
to
write
for
me
to
her
which
she
at
last
did
to
quiet
me
poor
nancy
thought
i
was
wild
and
as
i
could
not
write
for
myself
became
my
secretary
i
remember
too
our
walks
and
the
happiness
of
sitting
by
mary
in
the
children
apartment
at
their
house
not
far
from
the
plainstones
at
aberdeen
while
her
lesser
sister
helen
played
with
the
doll
and
we
sat
gravely
making
love
in
our
own
way
how
the
deuce
did
all
this
occur
so
early
where
could
it
originate
i
certainly
had
no
sexual
ideas
for
years
afterward
and
yet
my
misery
my
love
for
that
girl
were
so
violent
that
i
sometimes
doubt
if
i
have
ever
been
really
attached
since
be
that
as
it
may
hearing
of
her
marriage
several
years
afterward
was
as
a
thunderstroke
it
nearly
choked
me
to
the
horror
of
my
mother
and
the
astonishment
and
almost
incredulity
of
everybody
and
it
is
a
phenomenon
in
my
existence
for
i
was
not
eight
years
old
which
has
puzzled
and
will
puzzle
me
to
the
latest
hour
of
it
and
lately
i
know
not
why
the
recollection
not
the
attachment
has
recurred
as
forcibly
as
ever
i
wonder
if
she
can
have
the
least
remembrance
of
it
or
me
or
remember
pitying
her
sister
helen
for
not
having
an
admirer
too
how
very
pretty
is
the
perfect
image
of
her
in
my
memory
her
dark
brown
hair
and
hazel
eyes
her
very
dress
i
should
be
quite
grieved
to
see
her
now
the
reality
however
beautiful
would
destroy
or
at
least
confuse
the
features
of
the
lovely
peri
which
then
existed
in
her
and
still
lives
in
my
imagination
at
the
distance
of
more
than
sixteen
years
such
precocious
and
sympathetic
affections
are
as
i
have
already
mentioned
common
among
children
and
is
something
very
different
from
the
love
of
riper
years
but
the
extract
is
curious
and
shows
how
truly
little
and
vague
byron
experience
of
the
passion
must
have
been
in
his
recollection
of
the
girl
be
it
observed
there
is
no
circumstance
noticed
which
shows
however
strong
the
mutual
sympathy
the
slightest
influence
of
particular
attraction
he
recollects
the
colour
of
her
hair
the
hue
of
her
eyes
her
very
dress
and
he
remembers
her
as
a
peri
a
spirit
nor
does
it
appear
that
his
sleepless
restlessness
in
which
the
thought
of
her
was
ever
uppermost
was
produced
by
jealousy
or
doubt
or
fear
or
any
other
concomitant
of
the
passion
there
is
another
most
important
circumstance
in
what
may
be
called
the
aberdonian
epoch
of
lord
byron
life
that
byron
in
his
boyhood
was
possessed
of
lively
sensibilities
is
sufficiently
clear
that
he
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
indulging
his
humour
and
temper
without
restraint
is
not
disputable
and
that
his
natural
temperament
made
him
sensible
in
no
ordinary
degree
to
the
beauties
of
nature
is
also
abundantly
manifest
in
all
his
productions
but
it
is
surprising
that
this
admiration
of
the
beauties
of
nature
is
but
an
ingredient
in
byron
poetry
and
not
its
most
remarkable
characteristic
deep
feelings
of
dissatisfaction
and
disappointment
are
far
more
obvious
they
constitute
indeed
the
very
spirit
of
his
works
and
a
spirit
of
such
qualities
is
the
least
of
all
likely
to
have
arisen
from
the
contemplation
of
magnificent
nature
or
to
have
been
inspired
by
studying
her
storms
or
serenity
for
dissatisfaction
and
disappointment
are
the
offspring
of
moral
experience
and
have
no
natural
association
with
the
forms
of
external
things
the
habit
of
associating
morose
sentiments
with
any
particular
kind
of
scenery
only
shows
that
the
sources
of
the
sullenness
arose
in
similar
visible
circumstances
it
is
from
these
premises
i
would
infer
that
the
seeds
of
byron
misanthropic
tendencies
were
implanted
during
the
silent
rages
of
his
childhood
and
that
the
effect
of
mountain
scenery
which
continued
so
strong
upon
him
after
he
left
scotland
producing
the
sentiments
with
which
he
has
imbued
his
heroes
in
the
wild
circumstances
in
which
he
places
them
was
mere
reminiscence
and
association
for
although
the
sullen
tone
of
his
mind
was
not
fully
brought
out
until
he
wrote
childe
harold
it
is
yet
evident
from
his
hours
of
idleness
that
he
was
tuned
to
that
key
before
he
went
abroad
the
dark
colouring
of
his
mind
was
plainly
imbibed
in
a
mountainous
region
from
sombre
heaths
and
in
the
midst
of
rudeness
and
grandeur
he
had
no
taste
for
more
cheerful
images
and
there
are
neither
rural
objects
nor
villagery
in
the
scenes
he
describes
but
only
loneness
and
the
solemnity
of
mountains
to
those
who
are
acquainted
with
the
scottish
character
it
is
unnecessary
to
suggest
how
very
probable
it
is
that
mrs
byron
and
her
associates
were
addicted
to
the
oral
legends
of
the
district
and
of
her
ancestors
and
that
the
early
fancy
of
the
poet
was
nourished
with
the
shadowy
descriptions
in
the
tales
o
the
olden
time
at
last
this
is
manifest
that
although
byron
shows
little
of
the
melancholy
and
mourning
of
ossian
he
was
yet
evidently
influenced
by
some
strong
bias
and
congeniality
of
taste
to
brood
and
cogitate
on
topics
of
the
same
character
as
those
of
that
bard
moreover
besides
the
probability
of
his
imagination
having
been
early
tinged
with
the
sullen
hue
of
the
local
traditions
it
is
remarkable
that
the
longest
of
his
juvenile
poems
is
an
imitation
of
the
manner
of
the
homer
of
morven
in
addition
to
a
natural
temperament
kept
in
a
state
of
continual
excitement
by
unhappy
domestic
incidents
and
the
lurid
legends
of
the
past
there
were
other
causes
in
operation
around
the
young
poet
that
could
not
but
greatly
affect
the
formation
of
his
character
descended
of
a
distinguished
family
counting
among
its
ancestors
the
fated
line
of
the
scottish
kings
and
reduced
almost
to
extreme
poverty
it
is
highly
probable
both
from
the
violence
of
her
temper
and
the
pride
of
blood
that
mrs
byron
would
complain
of
the
almost
mendicant
condition
to
which
she
was
reduced
especially
so
long
as
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
her
son
was
not
likely
to
succeed
to
the
family
estates
and
dignity
of
his
father
lineage
few
traditions
were
perhaps
preserved
compared
with
those
of
his
mother
family
but
still
enough
was
known
to
impress
the
imagination
mr
moore
struck
with
this
circumstance
has
remarked
that
in
reviewing
the
ancestors
both
near
and
remote
of
lord
byron
it
can
not
fail
to
be
remarked
how
strikingly
he
combined
in
his
own
nature
some
of
the
best
and
perhaps
worst
qualities
that
lie
scattered
through
the
various
characters
of
his
predecessors
but
still
it
is
to
his
mother
traditions
of
her
ancestors
that
i
would
ascribe
the
conception
of
the
dark
and
guilty
beings
which
he
delighted
to
describe
and
though
it
may
be
contended
that
there
was
little
in
her
conduct
to
exalt
poetical
sentiment
still
there
was
a
great
deal
in
her
condition
calculated
to
affect
and
impel
an
impassioned
disposition
i
can
imagine
few
situations
more
likely
to
produce
lasting
recollections
of
interest
and
affection
than
that
in
which
mrs
byron
with
her
only
child
was
placed
in
aberdeen
whatever
might
have
been
the
violence
of
her
temper
or
the
improprieties
of
her
the
fond
and
mournful
caresses
with
which
she
used
to
hang
over
her
lame
and
helpless
orphan
must
have
greatly
contributed
to
the
formation
of
that
morbid
sensibility
which
became
the
chief
characteristic
of
his
life
at
the
same
time
if
it
did
contribute
to
fill
his
days
with
anguish
and
anxieties
it
also
undoubtedly
assisted
the
development
of
his
powers
and
i
am
therefore
disposed
to
conclude
that
although
with
respect
to
the
character
of
the
man
the
time
he
spent
in
aberdeen
can
only
be
contemplated
with
pity
mingled
with
sorrow
still
it
must
have
been
richly
fraught
with
incidents
of
inconceivable
value
to
the
genius
of
the
poet

detested
by
his

with

and
deserted
by

he

far
as
lay
in
his
power
alienated
the
land
which
should
have
kept
it

and
denuded
the
estate
of
the
timber
byron
has
described
the
conduct
of
the
morose
peer
in
very
strong
terms
after
his
trial
he
shut
himself
up
at
newstead
and
was
in
the
habit
of
feeding
crickets
which
were
his
only
companions
he
made
them
so
tame
that
they
used
to
crawl
over
him
and
when
they
were
too
familiar
he
whipped
them
with
a
wisp
of
straw
at
his
death
it
is
said
they
left
the
house
in
a
body
however
this
may
have
been
it
is
certain
that
byron
came
to
an
embarrassed
inheritance
both
as
respected
his
property
and
the
character
of
his
race
and
perhaps
though
his
genius
suffered
nothing
by
the
circumstance
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
he
was
still
left
under
the
charge
of
his
mother
a
woman
without
judgment
or
alternately
spoiling
her
child
by
indulgence
irritating
him
by
her
obstinacy
and
what
was
still
worse
amusing
him
by
her
violence
and
disgusting
him
by
fits
of
inebriety
sympathy
for
her
misfortunes
would
be
no
sufficient
apology
for
concealing
her
defects
they
undoubtedly
had
a
material
influence
on
her
son
and
her
appearance
was
often
the
subject
of
his
childish
ridicule
she
was
a
short
and
corpulent
person
she
rolled
in
her
gait
and
would
in
her
rage
sometimes
endeavour
to
catch
him
for
the
purpose
of
inflicting
punishment
while
he
would
run
round
the
room
mocking
her
menaces
and
mimicking
her
motion
the
greatest
weakness
in
lord
byron
character
was
a
morbid
sensibility
to
his
lameness
he
felt
it
with
as
much
vexation
as
if
it
had
been
inflicted
ignominy
one
of
the
most
striking
passages
in
some
memoranda
which
he
has
left
of
his
early
days
is
where
in
speaking
of
his
own
sensitiveness
on
the
subject
of
his
deformed
foot
he
described
the
feeling
of
horror
and
humiliation
that
came
over
him
when
his
mother
in
one
of
her
fits
of
passion
called
him
a
lame
brat
the
sense
which
byron
always
retained
of
the
innocent
fault
in
his
foot
was
unmanly
and
excessive
for
it
was
not
greatly
conspicuous
and
he
had
a
mode
of
walking
across
a
room
by
which
it
was
scarcely
at
all
perceptible
i
was
several
days
on
board
the
same
ship
with
him
before
i
happened
to
discover
the
defect
it
was
indeed
so
well
concealed
that
i
was
in
doubt
whether
his
lameness
was
the
effect
of
a
temporary
accident
or
a
malformation
until
i
asked
mr
hobhouse
on
their
arrival
from
scotland
byron
was
placed
by
his
mother
under
the
care
of
an
empirical
pretender
of
the
name
of
lavender
at
nottingham
who
professed
the
cure
of
such
cases
and
that
he
might
not
lose
ground
in
his
education
he
was
attended
by
a
respectable
schoolmaster
mr
rodgers
who
read
parts
of
virgil
and
cicero
with
him
of
this
gentleman
he
always
entertained
a
kind
remembrance
nor
was
his
regard
in
this
instance
peculiar
for
it
may
be
said
to
have
been
a
distinguishing
trait
in
his
character
to
recollect
with
affection
all
who
had
been
about
him
in
his
youth
the
quack
however
was
an
exception
whom
from
having
caused
him
to
suffer
much
pain
and
whose
pretensions
even
young
as
he
then
was
he
detected
he
delighted
to
expose
on
one
occasion
he
scribbled
down
on
a
sheet
of
paper
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
at
random
but
in
the
form
of
words
and
sentences
and
placing
them
before
lavender
asked
him
gravely
what
language
it
was
italian
was
the
reply
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
the
little
satirist
who
burst
into
a
triumphant
laugh
at
the
success
of
his
stratagem
it
is
said
that
about
this
time
the
first
symptom
of
his
predilection
for
rhyming
showed
itself
an
elderly
lady
a
visitor
to
his
mother
had
been
indiscreet
enough
to
give
him
some
offence
and
slights
he
generally
resented
with
more
energy
than
they
often
deserved
this
venerable
personage
entertained
a
singular
notion
respecting
the
soul
which
she
believed
took
its
flight
at
death
to
the
moon
one
day
after
a
repetition
of
her
original
contumely
he
appeared
before
his
nurse
in
a
violent
rage
and
complained
vehemently
of
the
old
lady
declaring
that
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
her
and
then
he
broke
out
into
the
following
doggerel
which
he
repeated
over
and
over
crowing
with
delight
in
nottingham
county
there
lives
at
as
curs
an
old
lady
as
ever
was
seen
and
when
she
does
die
which
i
hope
will
be
soon
she
firmly
believes
she
will
go
to
the
moon
mrs
byron
by
the
accession
of
her
son
to
the
family
honours
and
estate
received
no
addition
to
her
small
income
and
he
being
a
minor
was
unable
to
make
any
settlement
upon
her
a
representation
of
her
case
was
made
to
government
and
in
consequence
she
was
placed
on
the
for
pounds
byron
not
having
received
any
benefit
from
the
nottingham
quack
was
removed
to
london
put
under
the
care
of
dr
bailey
and
placed
in
the
school
of
dr
glennie
at
dulwich
mrs
byron
herself
took
a
house
on
sloan
terrace
moderation
in
all
athletic
exercises
was
prescribed
to
the
boy
but
dr
glennie
had
some
difficulty
in
restraining
his
activity
he
was
quiet
enough
while
in
the
house
with
the
doctor
but
no
sooner
was
he
released
to
play
than
he
showed
as
much
ambition
to
excel
in
violent
exercises
as
the
most
robust
youth
of
the
school
an
ambition
common
to
young
persons
who
have
the
misfortune
to
labour
under
bodily
defects
while
under
the
charge
of
dr
glennie
he
was
playful
and
beloved
by
his
companions
and
addicted
to
reading
history
and
poetry
far
beyond
the
usual
scope
of
his
age
in
these
studies
he
showed
a
predilection
for
the
scriptures
and
certainly
there
are
many
traces
in
his
works
which
show
that
whatever
the
laxity
of
his
religious
principles
may
have
been
in
he
was
not
unacquainted
with
the
records
and
history
of
our
religion
during
this
period
mrs
byron
often
indiscreetly
interfered
with
the
course
of
his
education
and
if
his
classical
studies
were
in
consequence
not
so
effectually
conducted
as
they
might
have
been
his
mind
derived
some
of
its
best
nutriment
from
the
loose
desultory
course
of
his
reading
among
the
books
to
which
the
boys
at
dr
glennie
school
had
access
was
a
pamphlet
containing
the
narrative
of
a
shipwreck
on
the
coast
of
arracan
filled
with
impressive
descriptions
it
had
not
attracted
much
public
attention
but
it
was
a
favourite
with
the
pupils
particularly
with
byron
and
furnished
him
afterwards
with
the
leading
circumstances
in
the
striking
description
of
the
shipwreck
in
don
juan
although
the
rhymes
upon
the
lunar
lady
of
notts
are
supposed
to
have
been
the
first
twitter
of
his
muse
he
has
said
himself
my
first
dash
into
poetry
was
as
early
as
it
was
the
ebullition
of
a
passion
for
my
first
cousin
margaret
parker
i
was
then
about
twelve
she
rather
older
perhaps
a
year
and
it
is
curious
to
remark
that
in
his
description
of
this
beautiful
girl
there
is
the
same
lack
of
animal
admiration
which
we
have
noticed
in
all
his
loves
he
says
of
her
i
do
not
recollect
scarcely
anything
equal
to
the
transparent
beauty
of
my
cousin
or
to
the
sweetness
of
her
temper
during
the
short
period
of
our
intimacy
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
made
out
of
a
rainbow
all
beauty
and
peace
this
is
certainly
poetically
expressed
but
there
was
more
true
love
in
pygmalion
passion
for
his
statue
and
in
the
parisian
maiden
adoration
of
the
apollo
when
he
had
been
nearly
two
years
under
the
tuition
of
dr
glennie
he
was
removed
to
harrow
chiefly
in
consequence
of
his
interference
with
his
studies
and
especially
by
withdrawing
him
often
from
school
during
the
time
he
was
under
the
care
of
dr
glennie
he
was
more
amiable
than
at
any
other
period
of
his
life
a
circumstance
which
justifies
the
supposition
that
had
he
been
left
more
to
the
discipline
of
that
respectable
person
he
would
have
proved
a
better
man
for
however
much
his
heart
afterwards
became
incrusted
with
the
leprosy
of
selfishness
at
this
period
his
feelings
were
warm
and
kind
towards
his
nurse
he
evinced
uncommon
affection
which
he
cherished
as
long
as
she
lived
he
presented
her
with
his
watch
the
first
he
possessed
and
also
a
miniature
of
himself
when
he
was
only
between
seven
and
eight
years
old
representing
him
with
a
profusion
of
curling
locks
and
in
his
hands
a
bow
and
arrow
the
sister
of
this
woman
had
been
his
first
nurse
and
after
he
had
left
scotland
he
wrote
to
her
in
a
spirit
which
betokened
a
gentle
and
sincere
heart
informing
her
with
much
joy
of
a
circumstance
highly
important
to
himself
it
was
to
tell
her
that
at
last
he
had
got
his
foot
so
far
restored
as
to
be
able
to
put
on
a
common
boot
an
event
which
he
was
sure
would
give
her
great
pleasure
to
himself
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
any
incident
which
could
have
been
more
gratifying
i
dwell
with
satisfaction
on
these
descriptions
of
his
early
dispositions
for
although
there
are
not
wanting
instances
of
similar
in
his
later
years
still
he
never
formed
any
attachments
so
pure
and
amiable
after
he
went
to
harrow
the
change
of
life
came
over
him
and
when
the
vegetable
period
of
boyhood
was
past
the
animal
passions
mastered
all
the
softer
affections
of
his
character
in
the
summer
of
he
accompanied
his
mother
to
cheltenham
and
while
he
resided
there
the
views
of
the
malvern
hills
recalled
to
his
memory
his
enjoyments
amid
the
wilder
scenery
of
aberdeenshire
the
recollections
were
reimpressed
on
his
heart
and
interwoven
with
his
strengthened
feelings
but
a
boy
gazing
with
emotion
on
the
hills
at
sunset
because
they
remind
him
of
the
mountains
where
he
passed
his
childhood
is
no
proof
that
he
is
already
in
heart
and
imagination
a
poet
to
suppose
so
is
to
mistake
the
materials
for
the
building
the
delight
of
byron
in
contemplating
the
malvern
hills
was
not
because
they
resembled
the
scenery
of
lochynagar
but
because
they
awoke
trains
of
thought
and
fancy
associated
with
recollections
of
that
scenery
the
poesy
of
the
feeling
lay
not
in
the
beauty
of
the
objects

it
was
those
reminiscences

similar

recalled

the

which
gave
life
and

to
his

there
is
not
more

it
is
the

nor

this
admit

would

opinion
were
it

i
can
not
explain
the
cause
that
local

like
local

is
in

the

awakens
among

consulted
a
respecting
the
destinies
of
her
son

according
to
her
feminine
notions
she
was
very
cunning
and
guarded
with
the
sybil
never
suspecting
that
she
might
have
been
previously
known
and
unconscious
to
herself
an
object
of
interest
to
the
spaewife
she
endeavoured
to
pass
herself
off
as
a
maiden
lady
and
regarded
it
as
no
small
testimony
of
the
wisdom
of
the
oracle
that
she
declared
her
to
be
not
only
a
married
woman
but
the
mother
of
a
son
who
was
lame
after
such
a
marvellous
proof
of
it
may
easily
be
conceived
with
what
awe
and
faith
she
listened
to
the
prediction
that
his
life
should
be
in
danger
from
poison
before
he
was
of
age
and
that
he
should
be
twice
married
the
second
time
to
a
foreign
lady
whether
it
was
this
same
who
foretold
that
he
would
in
his
year
incur
some
great
misfortune
is
not
certain
but
considering
his
unhappy
english
marriage
and
his
subsequent
italian
liaison
with
the
countess
guiccioli
the
marital
prediction
was
not
far
from
receiving
its
accomplishment
the
fact
of
his
marriage
taking
place
in
his
year
is
at
least
a
curious
circumstance
and
has
been
noticed
by
himself
with
a
sentiment
of
superstition

powers
in
passing
from
the
quiet
academy
of
dulwich
grove
to
the
public
school
of
harrow
the
change
must
have
been
great
to
any
boy
to
byron
it
was
punishment
and
for
the
first
year
and
a
half
he
hated
the
place
in
the
end
however
he
rose
to
be
a
leader
in
all
the
sports
and
mischiefs
of
his
schoolfellows
but
it
never
could
be
said
that
he
was
a
popular
boy
however
much
he
was
distinguished
for
spirit
and
bravery
for
if
he
was
not
quarrelsome
he
was
sometimes
vindictive
still
it
could
not
have
been
to
any
inveterate
degree
for
undoubtedly
in
his
younger
years
he
was
susceptible
of
warm
impressions
from
gentle
treatment
and
his
obstinacy
and
arbitrary
humour
were
perhaps
more
the
effects
of
unrepressed
habit
than
of
natural
bias
they
were
the
prickles
which
surrounded
his
genius
in
the
bud
at
harrow
he
acquired
no
distinction
as
a
student
indeed
at
no
period
was
he
remarkable
for
steady
application
under
dr
glennie
he
had
made
but
little
progress
and
it
was
chiefly
in
consequence
of
his
backwardness
that
he
was
removed
from
his
academy
when
placed
with
dr
drury
it
was
with
an
intimation
that
he
had
a
cleverness
about
him
but
that
his
education
had
been
neglected
the
early
dislike
which
byron
felt
towards
the
earl
of
carlisle
is
abundantly
well
known
and
he
had
the
magnanimity
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
in
some
respects
unjust
but
the
antipathy
was
not
all
on
one
side
nor
will
it
be
easy
to
parallel
the
conduct
of
the
earl
with
that
of
any
guardian
it
is
but
justice
therefore
to
byron
to
make
the
public
aware
that
the
dislike
began
on
the
part
of
lord
carlisle
and
originated
in
some
distaste
which
he
took
to
mrs
byron
manners
and
at
the
trouble
she
sometimes
gave
him
on
account
of
her
son
dr
drury
in
his
communication
to
mr
moore
respecting
the
early
history
of
byron
mentions
a
singular
circumstance
as
to
this
subject
which
we
record
with
the
more
pleasure
because
byron
has
been
blamed
and
has
blamed
himself
for
his
irreverence
towards
lord
carlisle
while
it
appears
that
the
fault
lay
with
the
earl
after
some
continuance
at
harrow
says
dr
drury
and
when
the
powers
of
his
mind
had
begun
to
expand
the
late
lord
carlisle
his
relation
desired
to
see
me
in
town
i
waited
on
his
lordship
his
object
was
to
inform
me
of
lord
byron
expectations
of
property
when
he
came
of
age
which
he
represented
as
contracted
and
to
inquire
respecting
his
abilities
on
the
former
circumstance
i
made
no
remark
as
to
the
latter
i
replied
has
talents
my
lord
which
will
add
lustre
to
his
rank
said
his
lordship
with
a
degree
of
surprise
that
according
to
my
feelings
did
not
express
in
it
all
the
satisfaction
i
expected
lord
carlisle
had
indeed
much
of
the
byron
humour
in
him
his
mother
was
a
sister
of
the
homicidal
lord
and
possessed
some
of
the
family
peculiarity
she
was
endowed
with
great
talent
and
in
her
latter
days
she
exhibited
great
singularity
she
wrote
beautiful
verses
and
piquant
epigrams
among
others
there
is
a
poetical
effusion
of
her
pen
addressed
to
mrs
greville
on
her
ode
to
indifference
which
at
the
time
was
much
admired
and
has
been
with
other
poems
of
her
ladyship
published
in
pearch
collection
after
moving
for
a
long
time
as
one
of
the
most
brilliant
orbs
in
the
sphere
of
fashion
she
suddenly
retired
and
like
her
morose
brother
shut
herself
up
from
the
world
while
she
lived
in
this
seclusion
she
became
an
object
of
the
sportive
satire
of
the
late
mr
fox
who
characterized
her
as
carlisle
recluse
in
pride
and
rags
i
have
heard
a
still
coarser
apostrophe
by
the
same
gentleman
it
seems
they
had
quarrelled
and
on
his
leaving
her
in
the
room
she
called
after
him
that
he
might
go
about
his
business
for
she
did
not
care
two
skips
of
a
louse
for
him
on
coming
to
the
hall
finding
paper
and
ink
on
the
table
he
wrote
two
lines
in
answer
and
sent
it
up
to
her
ladyship
to
the
effect
that
she
always
spoke
of
what
was
running
in
her
head
byron
has
borne
testimony
to
the
merits
of
his
guardian
her
son
as
a
tragic
poet
by
characterizing
his
publications
as
paper
books
it
is
however
said
that
they
nevertheless
showed
some
talent
and
that
the
father
revenge
one
of
the
tragedies
was
submitted
to
the
judgment
of
dr
johnson
who
did
not
despise
it
but
to
return
to
the
progress
of
byron
at
harrow
it
is
certain
that
notwithstanding
the
affectionate
solicitude
of
dr
drury
to
encourage
him
he
never
became
an
eminent
scholar
at
least
we
have
his
own
testimony
to
that
effect
in
the
fourth
canto
of
childe
harold
the
lines
however
in
which
that
testimony
stands
recorded
are
among
the
weakest
he
ever
penned
may
he
who
will
his
recollections
rake
and
quote
in
classic
raptures
and
awake
the
hills
with
latin
echoes
i
too
much
to
conquer
for
the
poet
sake
the
drill
dull
lesson
forced
down
word
by
word
in
my
repugnant
youth
with
pleasure
to
record
and
as
an
apology
for
the
defect
he
makes
the
following
remarks
in
a
note
subjoined
i
wish
to
express
that
we
become
tired
of
the
task
before
we
can
comprehend
the
beauty
that
we
learn
by
rote
before
we
can
get
by
heart
that
the
freshness
is
worn
away
and
the
future
pleasure
and
advantage
deadened
and
destroyed
by
the
didactic
anticipation
at
an
age
when
we
can
neither
feel
nor
understand
the
power
of
compositions
which
it
requires
an
acquaintance
with
life
as
well
as
latin
and
greek
to
relish
or
to
reason
upon
for
the
same
reason
we
never
can
be
aware
of
the
fulness
of
some
of
the
finest
passages
of
shakspeare
be
or
not
to
be
for
instance
from
the
habit
of
having
them
hammered
into
us
at
eight
years
old
as
an
exercise
not
of
mind
but
of
memory
so
that
when
we
are
old
enough
to
enjoy
them
the
taste
is
gone
and
the
appetite
palled
in
some
parts
of
the
continent
young
persons
are
taught
from
mere
common
authors
and
do
not
read
the
best
classics
until
their
maturity
i
certainly
do
not
speak
on
this
point
from
any
pique
or
aversion
towards
the
place
of
my
education
i
was
not
a
slow
or
an
idle
boy
and
i
believe
no
one
could
be
more
attached
to
harrow
than
i
have
always
been
and
with
reason
a
part
of
the
time
passed
there
was
the
happiest
of
my
life
and
my
preceptor
the
rev
dr
joseph
drury
was
the
best
and
worthiest
friend
i
ever
possessed
whose
warnings
i
have
remembered
but
too
well
though
too
late
when
i
have
erred
and
whose
counsels
i
have
but
followed
when
i
have
done
well
and
wisely
if
ever
this
imperfect
record
of
my
feelings
towards
him
should
reach
his
eyes
let
it
remind
him
of
one
who
never
thinks
of
him
but
with
gratitude
and
veneration
of
one
who
would
more
gladly
boast
of
having
been
his
pupil
if
by
more
closely
following
his
injunctions
he
could
reflect
any
honour
upon
his
instructor
lord
byron
however
is
not
singular
in
his
opinion
of
the
inutility
of
premature
classical
studies
and
notwithstanding
the
able
manner
in
which
the
late
dean
vincent
defended
public
education
we
have
some
notion
that
his
reasoning
upon
this
point
will
not
be
deemed
conclusive
milton
says
dr
vincent
complained
of
the
years
that
were
wasted
in
teaching
the
dead
languages
cowley
also
complained
that
classical
education
taught
words
only
and
not
things
and
addison
deemed
it
an
inexpiable
error
that
boys
with
genius
or
without
were
all
to
be
bred
poets
indiscriminately
as
far
then
as
respects
the
education
of
a
poet
we
should
think
that
the
names
of
milton
cowley
addison
and
byron
would
go
well
to
settle
the
question
especially
when
it
is
recollected
how
little
shakspeare
was
indebted
to
the
study
of
the
classics
and
that
burns
knew
nothing
of
them
at
all
i
do
not
however
adopt
the
opinion
as
correct
neither
do
i
think
that
dean
vincent
took
a
right
view
of
the
subject
for
as
discipline
the
study
of
the
classics
may
be
highly
useful
at
the
same
time
the
mere
hammering
of
greek
and
latin
into
english
can
not
be
very
conducive
to
the
refinement
of
taste
or
the
exaltation
of
sentiment
nor
is
there
either
common
sense
or
correct
logic
in
the
following
observations
made
on
the
passage
and
note
quoted
by
the
anonymous
author
of
childe
harold
monitor
this
doctrine
of
antipathies
contracted
by
the
impatience
of
youth
against
the
noblest
authors
of
antiquity
from
the
circumstance
of
having
been
made
the
vehicle
of
early
instruction
is
a
most
dangerous
doctrine
indeed
since
it
strikes
at
the
root
not
only
of
all
pure
taste
but
of
all
praiseworthy
industry
it
would
if
acted
upon
as
harold
by
the
mention
of
the
continental
practice
of
using
inferior
writers
in
the
business
of
tuition
would
seem
to
recommend
destroy
the
great
source
of
the
intellectual
vigour
of
our
countrymen
this
is
undoubtedly
assuming
too
much
for
those
who
have
objected
to
the
years
wasted
in
teaching
the
dead
languages
do
not
admit
that
the
labour
of
acquiring
them
either
improves
the
taste
or
adds
to
the
vigour
of
the
understanding
and
therefore
before
the
soundness
of
the
opinion
of
milton
of
cowley
of
addison
and
of
many
other
great
men
can
be
rejected
it
falls
on
those
who
are
of
dean
vincent
opinion
and
that
of
childe
harold
monitor
to
prove
that
the
study
of
the
learned
languages
is
of
so
much
primary
importance
as
they
claim
for
it
but
it
appears
that
byron
mind
during
the
early
period
of
his
residence
at
harrow
was
occupied
with
another
object
than
his
studies
and
which
may
partly
account
for
his
inattention
to
them
he
fell
in
love
with
mary
chaworth
she
was
he
is
represented
to
have
said
several
years
older
than
myself
but
at
my
age
boys
like
something
older
than
themselves
as
they
do
younger
later
in
life
our
estates
adjoined
but
owing
to
the
unhappy
circumstances
of
the
feud
the
affair
of
the
fatal
duel
our
families
as
is
generally
the
case
with
neighbours
who
happen
to
be
near
relations
were
never
on
terms
of
more
than
common
civility
scarcely
those
she
was
the
beau
ideal
of
all
that
my
youthful
fancy
could
paint
of
the
beautiful
and
i
have
taken
all
my
fables
about
the
celestial
nature
of
women
from
the
perfection
my
imagination
created
in
her
i
say
created
for
i
found
her
like
the
rest
of
the
sex
anything
but
angelic
i
returned
to
harrow
after
my
trip
to
cheltenham
more
deeply
enamoured
than
ever
and
passed
the
next
holidays
at
newstead
i
now
began
to
fancy
myself
a
man
and
to
make
love
in
earnest
our
meetings
were
stolen
ones
and
my
letters
passed
through
the
medium
of
a
confidant
a
gate
leading
from
mr
chaworth
grounds
to
those
of
my
mother
was
the
place
of
our
interviews
but
the
ardour
was
all
on
my
side
i
was
serious
she
was
volatile
she
liked
me
as
a
younger
brother
and
treated
and
laughed
at
me
as
a
boy
she
however
gave
me
her
picture
and
that
was
something
to
make
verses
upon
had
i
married
miss
chaworth
perhaps
the
whole
tenor
of
my
life
would
have
been
different
she
jilted
me
however
but
her
marriage
proved
anything
but
a
happy
one
it
is
to
this
attachment
that
we
are
indebted
for
the
beautiful
poem
of
the
dream
and
the
stanzas
beginning
oh
had
my
fate
been
joined
to
thine
although
this
love
affair
a
little
interfered
with
his
greek
and
latin
his
time
was
not
passed
without
some
attention
to
reading
until
he
was
eighteen
years
old
he
had
never
seen
a
review
but
his
general
information
was
so
extensive
on
modern
topics
as
to
induce
a
suspicion
that
he
could
only
have
collected
so
much
information
from
reviews
as
he
was
never
seen
reading
but
always
idle
and
in
mischief
or
at
play
he
was
however
a
devourer
of
books
he
read
eating
read
in
bed
read
when
no
one
else
read
and
had
perused
all
sorts
of
books
from
the
time
he
first
could
spell
but
had
never
read
a
review
and
knew
not
what
the
name
implied
it
should
be
here
noticed
that
while
he
was
at
harrow
his
qualities
were
rather
oratorical
than
poetical
and
if
an
opinion
had
then
been
formed
of
the
likely
result
of
his
character
the
prognostication
would
have
led
to
the
expectation
of
an
orator
altogether
his
conduct
at
harrow
indicated
a
clever
but
not
an
extraordinary
boy
he
formed
a
few
friendships
there
in
which
his
attachment
appears
to
have
been
in
some
instances
remarkable
the
late
duke
of
dorset
was
his
fag
and
he
was
not
considered
a
very
hard
taskmaster
he
certainly
did
not
carry
with
him
from
harrow

byron
at

his
hours
of
idleness
in
reconsidering
the
four
years
which
byron
spent
at
harrow
while
we
can
clearly
trace
the
development
of
the
sensibilities
of
his
character
and
an
increased
tension
of
his
susceptibility
by
which
impressions
became
more
acute
and
delicate
it
seems
impossible
not
to
perceive
by
the
records
which
he
has
himself
left
of
his
feelings
that
something
morbid
was
induced
upon
them
had
he
not
afterwards
so
magnificently
distinguished
himself
as
a
poet
it
is
not
probable
that
he
would
have
been
recollected
by
his
schoolfellows
as
having
been
in
any
respect
different
from
the
common
herd
his
activity
and
spirit
in
their
controversies
and
quarrels
were
but
the
outbreakings
of
that
temperament
which
the
discipline
of
riper
years
and
the
natural
awe
of
the
world
afterward
reduced
into
his
hereditary
cast
of
character
in
which
so
much
of
sullenness
and
misanthropy
was
exhibited
i
can
not
however
think
that
there
was
anything
either
in
the
nature
of
his
pastimes
or
his
studies
unfavourable
to
the
formation
of
the
poetical
character
his
amusements
were
active
his
reading
though
without
method
was
yet
congenial
to
his
impassioned
imagination
and
the
phantom
of
an
enthusiastic
attachment
of
which
miss
chaworth
was
not
the
only
object
for
it
was
altogether
intellectual
and
shared
with
others
were
circumstances
calculated
to
open
various
sources
of
reflection
and
to
concentrate
the
elements
of
an
energetic
and
original
mind
but
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
sketch
what
may
have
been
the
outline
of
a
young
poet
education
the
supposition
that
poets
must
be
dreamers
because
there
is
often
much
dreaminess
in
poesy
is
a
mere
hypothesis
of
all
the
professors
of
metaphysical
discernment
poets
require
the
finest
tact
and
contemplation
is
with
them
a
sign
of
inward
abstract
reflection
more
than
of
any
process
of
mind
by
which
resemblance
is
traced
and
associations
awakened
there
is
no
account
of
any
great
poet
whose
genius
was
of
that
dreamy
cartilaginous
kind
which
hath
its
being
in
haze
and
draws
its
nourishment
from
lights
and
shadows
which
ponders
over
the
mysteries
of
trees
and
interprets
the
oracles
of
babbling
waters
they
have
all
been
men
worldly
men
different
only
from
others
in
reasoning
more
by
feeling
than
induction
directed
by
impulse
in
a
greater
degree
than
other
men
poets
are
apt
to
be
betrayed
into
actions
which
make
them
singular
as
compared
by
those
who
are
less
imaginative
but
the
effects
of
earnestness
should
never
be
confounded
with
the
qualities
of
talent
no
greater
misconception
has
ever
been
obtruded
upon
the
world
as
philosophic
criticism
than
the
theory
of
poets
being
the
offspring
of
capering
lambkins
and
cooing
doves
for
they
differ
in
no
respect
from
other
men
of
high
endowment
but
in
the
single
circumstance
of
the
objects
to
which
their
taste
is
attracted
the
most
vigorous
poets
those
who
have
influenced
longest
and
are
most
quoted
have
indeed
been
all
men
of
great
shrewdness
of
remark
and
anything
but
your
contemplators
to
adduce
many
instances
is
unnecessary
are
there
any
symptoms
of
the
gelatinous
character
of
the
effusions
of
the
lakers
in
the
compositions
of
homer
the
london
gazette
does
not
tell
us
things
more
like
facts
than
the
narratives
of
homer
and
it
often
states
facts
that
are
much
more
like
fictions
than
his
most
poetical
inventions
so
much
is
this
the
case
with
the
works
of
all
the
higher
poets
that
as
they
recede
from
that
worldly
standard
which
is
found
in
the
epics
of
homer
they
sink
in
the
scale
of
poets
in
what
does
the
inferiority
of
virgil
for
example
consist
but
in
his
having
hatched
fancies
in
his
contemplations
which
the
calm
mind
rejects
as
absurdities
then
tasso
with
his
enchanted
forests
and
his
other
improbabilities
are
they
more
than
childish
tales
tales
too
not
in
fancy
to
be
compared
with
those
of
that
venerable
mother
bunch
compare
the
poets
that
babble
of
green
fields
with
those
who
deal
in
the
actions
and
passions
of
men
such
as
shakspeare
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
it
is
not
those
who
have
looked
at
external
nature
who
are
the
true
poets
but
those
who
have
seen
and
considered
most
about
the
business
and
bosom
of
man
it
may
be
an
advantage
that
a
poet
should
have
the
benefit
of
landscapes
and
storms
as
children
are
the
better
for
country
air
and
cow
milk
but
the
true
scene
of
their
manly
work
and
business
is
in
the
populous
city
inasmuch
as
byron
was
a
lover
of
solitude
he
was
deficient
as
an
observer
of
men
the
barrenest
portion
as
to
materials
for
biography
in
the
life
of
this
interesting
man
is
the
period
he
spent
at
the
university
of
cambridge
like
that
of
most
young
men
it
is
probable
the
major
part
of
his
time
was
passed
between
the
metropolis
and
the
university
still
it
was
in
that
period
he
composed
the
different
poems
which
make
up
the
little
volume
of
the
hours
of
idleness
a
work
which
will
ever
be
regarded
more
by
its
consequences
than
its
importance
as
of
great
influence
on
the
character
and
career
of
the
poet
it
has
been
supposed
i
see
not
how
justly
that
there
was
affectation
in
the
title
it
is
probable
that
byron
intended
no
more
by
it
than
to
imply
that
its
contents
were
sketches
of
leisure
this
is
the
less
doubtful
as
he
was
at
that
period
particularly
sensitive
concerning
the
opinion
that
might
be
entertained
of
his
works
before
he
made
the
collection
many
of
the
pieces
had
been
circulated
and
he
had
gathered
opinions
as
to
their
merits
with
a
degree
of
solicitude
that
can
only
be
conceived
by
those
who
were
acquainted
with
the
constantly
excited
sensibility
of
his
mind
when
he
did
publish
the
collection
nothing
appeared
in
the
style
and
form
of
the
publication
that
indicated
any
arrogance
of
merit
on
the
contrary
it
was
brought
forward
with
a
degree
of
diffidence
which
if
it
did
not
deserve
the
epithet
of
modesty
could
incur
nothing
harsher
than
that
of
bashfulness
it
was
printed
at
the
obscure
press
of
newark
was
altogether
a
very
homely
rustic
work
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
bespeak
for
it
a
good
name
from
the
critics
it
was
truly
an
innocent
affair
and
an
unpretending
performance
but
notwithstanding
these
at
least
seeming
qualities
of
young
doubtfulness
and
timidity
they
did
not
soften
the
austere
nature
of
the
bleak
and
blighting
criticism
which
was
then
characteristic
of
edinburgh
a
copy
was
somehow
communicated
to
one
of
the
critics
in
that
city
and
was
reviewed
by
him
in
the
edinburgh
review
in
an
article
replete
with
satire
and
insinuations
calculated
to
prey
upon
the
feelings
while
the
injustice
of
the
estimate
which
was
made
of
his
talent
and
originality
could
not
but
be
as
iron
in
his
heart
owing
to
the
deep
and
severe
impression
which
it
left
it
ought
to
be
preserved
in
every
memoir
which
treats
of
the
development
of
his
genius
and
character
and
for
this
reason
i
insert
it
entire
as
one
of
the
most
influential
documents
perhaps
in
the
whole
extent
of
biography
chapter
vi
criticism
of
the
edinburgh
review
the
poesy
of
this
young
lord
belongs
to
the
class
which
neither
god
nor
man
are
said
to
permit
indeed
we
do
not
recollect
to
have
seen
a
quantity
of
verse
with
so
few
deviations
in
either
direction
from
that
exact
standard
his
effusions
are
spread
over
a
dead
flat
and
can
no
more
get
above
or
below
the
level
than
if
they
were
so
much
stagnant
water
as
an
extenuation
of
this
offence
the
noble
author
is
peculiarly
forward
in
pleading
minority
we
have
it
in
the
page
and
on
the
very
back
of
the
volume
it
follows
his
name
like
a
favourite
part
of
his
style
much
stress
is
laid
upon
it
in
the
preface
and
the
poems
are
connected
with
this
general
statement
of
his
case
by
particular
dates
substantiating
the
age
at
which
each
was
written
now
the
law
upon
the
point
of
minority
we
hold
to
be
perfectly
clear
it
is
a
plea
available
only
to
the
defendant
no
plaintiff
can
offer
it
as
a
supplementary
ground
of
action
thus
if
any
suit
could
be
brought
against
lord
byron
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
him
to
put
into
court
a
certain
quantity
of
poetry
and
if
judgment
were
given
against
him
it
is
highly
probable
that
an
exception
would
be
taken
were
he
to
deliver
for
poetry
the
contents
of
this
volume
to
this
he
might
plead
minority
but
as
he
now
makes
voluntary
tender
of
the
article
he
hath
no
right
to
sue
on
that
ground
for
the
price
in
good
current
praise
should
the
goods
be
unmarketable
this
is
our
view
of
the
law
on
the
point
and
we
dare
to
say
so
will
it
be
ruled
perhaps
however
in
reality
all
that
he
tells
us
about
his
youth
is
rather
with
a
view
to
increase
our
wonder
than
to
soften
our
censures
he
possibly
means
to
say
how
a
minor
can
write
this
poem
was
actually
composed
by
a
young
man
of
eighteen
and
this
by
one
of
only
sixteen
but
alas
we
all
remember
the
poetry
of
cowley
at
ten
and
pope
at
twelve
and
so
far
from
hearing
with
any
degree
of
surprise
that
very
poor
verses
were
written
by
a
youth
from
his
leaving
school
to
his
leaving
college
inclusive
we
really
believe
this
to
be
the
most
common
of
all
occurrences
that
it
happens
in
the
life
of
nine
men
in
ten
who
are
educated
in
england
and
that
the
tenth
man
writes
better
verse
than
lord
byron
his
other
plea
of
privilege
our
author
brings
forward
to
waive
it
he
certainly
however
does
allude
frequently
to
his
family
and
ancestors
sometimes
in
poetry
sometimes
in
notes
and
while
giving
up
his
claim
on
the
score
of
rank
he
takes
care
to
remind
us
of
dr
johnson
saying
that
when
a
nobleman
appears
as
an
author
his
merit
should
be
handsomely
acknowledged
in
truth
it
is
this
consideration
only
that
induces
us
to
give
lord
byron
poems
a
place
in
our
review
besides
our
desire
to
counsel
him
that
he
do
forthwith
abandon
poetry
and
turn
his
talents
which
are
considerable
and
his
opportunities
which
are
great
to
better
account
with
this
view
we
must
beg
leave
seriously
to
assure
him
that
the
mere
rhyming
of
the
final
syllable
even
when
accompanied
by
the
presence
of
a
certain
number
of
feet
nay
although
which
does
not
always
happen
these
feet
should
scan
regularly
and
have
been
all
counted
upon
the
fingers
is
not
the
whole
art
of
poetry
we
would
entreat
him
to
believe
that
a
certain
portion
of
liveliness
somewhat
of
fancy
is
necessary
to
constitute
a
poem
and
that
a
poem
in
the
present
day
to
be
read
must
contain
at
least
one
thought
even
in
a
little
degree
different
from
the
ideas
of
former
writers
or
differently
expressed
we
put
it
to
his
candour
whether
there
is
anything
so
deserving
the
name
of
poetry
in
verses
like
the
following
written
in
and
whether
if
a
youth
of
eighteen
could
say
anything
so
uninteresting
to
his
ancestors
a
youth
of
nineteen
should
publish
it
shades
of
heroes
farewell
your
descendant
departing
from
the
seat
of
his
ancestors
bids
you
adieu
abroad
or
at
home
your
remembrance
imparting
new
courage
he
think
upon
glory
and
you
though
a
tear
dim
his
eye
at
this
sad
separation
is
nature
not
fear
that
excites
his
regret
far
distant
he
goes
with
the
same
emulation
the
fame
of
his
fathers
he
can
forget
that
fame
and
that
memory
still
will
he
cherish
he
vows
that
he
will
disgrace
your
renown
like
you
will
he
live
or
like
you
will
he
perish
when
decay
may
he
mingle
his
dust
with
your
own
now
we
positively
do
assert
that
there
is
nothing
better
than
these
stanzas
in
the
whole
compass
of
the
noble
minor
volume
lord
byron
should
also
have
a
care
of
attempting
what
the
greatest
poets
have
done
before
him
for
comparisons
as
he
must
have
had
occasion
to
see
at
his
are
odious
gray
ode
to
eton
college
should
really
have
kept
out
the
ten
hobbling
stanzas
on
a
distant
view
of
the
village
and
school
at
harrow
where
fancy
yet
joys
to
trace
the
resemblance
of
comrades
in
friendship
or
mischief
allied
how
welcome
to
me
your
remembrance
which
rests
in
the
bosom
though
hope
is
denied
in
like
manner
the
exquisite
lines
of
mr
rogers
on
a
tear
might
have
warned
the
noble
author
of
these
premises
and
spared
us
a
whole
dozen
such
stanzas
as
the
following
mild
charity
glow
to
us
mortals
below
shows
the
soul
from
barbarity
clear
compassion
will
melt
where
the
virtue
is
felt
and
its
dew
is
diffused
in
a
tear
the
man
doom
to
sail
with
the
blast
of
the
gale
through
billows
atlantic
to
steer
as
he
bends
the
wave
which
may
soon
be
his
grave
the
green
sparkles
bright
with
a
tear
and
so
of
instances
in
which
former
poets
had
failed
thus
we
do
not
think
lord
byron
was
made
for
translating
during
his
nonage
adrian
address
to
his
soul
when
pope
succeeded
indifferently
in
the
attempt
if
our
readers
however
are
of
another
opinion
they
may
look
at
it
ah
gentle
fleeting
sprite
friend
and
associate
of
this
clay
to
what
unknown
region
borne
wilt
thou
now
wing
thy
distant
flight
no
more
with
wonted
humour
gay
but
pallid
cheerless
and
forlorn
however
be
this
as
it
may
we
fear
his
translations
and
imitations
are
great
favourities
with
lord
byron
we
have
them
of
all
kinds
from
anacreon
to
ossian
and
viewing
them
as
they
may
pass
only
why
print
them
after
they
have
had
their
day
and
served
their
turn
and
why
call
the
thing
in
a
translation
where
two
words
greek
of
the
original
are
expanded
into
four
lines
and
the
other
thing
in
where
greek
is
rendered
by
means
of
six
hobbling
verses
as
to
his
ossian
poesy
we
are
not
very
good
judges
being
in
truth
so
moderately
skilled
in
that
species
of
composition
that
we
should
in
all
probability
be
criticising
some
bit
of
genuine
macpherson
itself
were
we
to
express
our
opinion
of
lord
byron
rhapsodies
if
then
the
following
beginning
of
a
song
of
bards
is
by
his
lordship
we
venture
to
object
to
it
as
far
as
we
can
comprehend
it
form
rises
on
the
roar
of
clouds
whose
dark
ghost

the
red
stream

his
voice

thunder

the
brown
chief
of

was
etc
after
detaining
this
chief
some
time
the
bards
conclude
by
giving
him
their
advice
to
his
fair
locks
then
to
them
on
the
arch
of
the
rainbow
and
to
through
the
tears
of
the
storm
of
this
kind
of
thing
there
are
no
less
than
nine
pages
and
we
can
so
far
venture
an
opinion
in
their
favour
that
they
look
very
like
macpherson
and
we
are
positive
they
are
pretty
nearly
as
stupid
and
tiresome
it
is
some
sort
of
privilege
of
poets
to
be
egotists
but
they
should
it
as
not
abusing
it
and
particularly
one
who
piques
himself
though
indeed
at
the
ripe
age
of
nineteen
on
being
an
infant
bard
the
artless
helicon

boast

youth
should
either
not
know
or
should
seem
not
to
know
so
much
about
his
own
ancestry
besides
a
poem
above
cited
on
the
of
the
byrons
we
have
another
of
eleven
pages
on
the
selfsame
subject
introduced
with
an
apology
certainly
had
no
intention
of
inserting
it
but
really
particular
request
of
some
friends
etc
etc
it
concludes
with
five
stanzas
on
himself
last
and
youngest
of
the
noble
line
there
is
also
a
good
deal
about
his
maternal
ancestors
in
a
poem
on
a
mountain
where
he
spent
part
of
his
youth
and
might
have
learned
that
pibroach
is
not
a
bagpipe
any
more
than
a
duet
means
a
fiddle
as
the
author
has
dedicated
so
large
a
part
of
his
volume
to
immortalize
his
employments
at
school
and
college
we
can
not
possibly
dismiss
it
without
presenting
the
reader
with
a
specimen
of
these
ingenious
effusions
in
an
ode
with
a
greek
motto
called
granta
we
have
the
following
magnificent
stanzas
there
in
apartments
small
and
damp
the
candidate
for
college
prizes
sits
poring
by
the
midnight
lamp
goes
late
to
bed
yet
early
rises
who
reads
false
quantities
in
seale
or
puzzles
the
deep
triangle
depriv
of
many
a
wholesome
meal
in
barbarous
latin
doomed
to
wrangle
renouncing
every
pleasing
page
from
authors
of
historic
use
preferring
to
the
letter
sage
the
square
of
the
hypotenuse
still
harmless
are
these
occupations
that
hurt
none
but
the
hapless
student
compared
with
other
recreations
which
bring
together
the
imprudent
we
are
sorry
to
hear
so
bad
an
account
of
the
as
is
contained
in
the
following
attic
stanzas
our
choir
could
scarcely
be
excused
even
as
a
band
of
raw
beginners
all
mercy
now
must
be
refused
to
such
a
set
of
croaking
sinners
if
david
when
his
toils
were
ended
had
heard
these
blockheads
sing
before
him
to
us
his
psalms
had
descended
in
furious
mood
he
would
have
tore
but
whatever
judgment
may
be
passed
on
the
poems
of
this
noble
minor
it
seems
we
must
take
them
as
we
find
them
and
be
content
for
they
are
the
last
we
shall
ever
have
from
him
he
is
at
best
he
says
but
an
intruder
into
the
groves
of
parnassus
he
never
lived
in
a
garret
like
thoroughbred
poets
and
though
he
once
roved
a
careless
mountaineer
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
he
has
not
of
late
enjoyed
this
advantage
moreover
he
expects
no
profit
from
his
publication
and
whether
it
succeeds
or
not
it
is
highly
improbable
from
his
situation
and
pursuits
that
he
should
again
condescend
to
become
an
author
therefore
let
us
take
what
we
get
and
be
thankful
what
right
have
we
poor
devils
to
be
nice
we
are
well
off
to
have
got
so
much
from
a
man
of
this
lord
station
who
does
not
live
in
a
garret
but
has
got
the
sway
of
newstead
abbey
again
we
say
let
us
be
thankful
and
with
honest
sancho
bid
god
bless
the
giver
nor
look
the
in
the
mouth
the
criticism
is
ascribed
to
mr
francis
jeffrey
an
eloquent
member
of
the
scottish
bar
and
who
was
at
that
time
supposed
to
be
the
editor
of
the
edinburgh
review
that
it
was
neither
just
nor
fair
is
sufficiently
evident
by
the
degree
of
care
and
artificial
point
with
which
it
has
been
drawn
up
had
the
poetry
been
as
insignificant
as
the
critic
affected
to
consider
it
it
would
have
argued
little
for
the
judgment
of
mr
jeffrey
to
take
so
much
pains
on
a
work
which
he
considered
worthless
but
the
world
has
no
cause
to
repine
at
the
severity
of
his
strictures
for
they
unquestionably
had
the
effect
of
kindling
the
indignation
of
byron
and
of
instigating
him
to
that
retaliation
which
he
so
spiritedly
inflicted
in
his
satire
of
english
bards
and
scotch
reviewers
it
is
amusing
to
compare
the
respective
literary
reputation
of
the
poet
and
the
critic
as
they
are
estimated
by
the
public
now
that
the
one
is
dead
and
the
other
dormant
the
voice
of
all
the
age
acknowledges
byron
to
have
been
the
greatest
poetical
genius
of
his
time
mr
jeffrey
though
still
enjoying
the
renown
of
being
a
shrewd
and
intelligent
critic
of
the
productions
of
others
has
established
no
right
to
the
honour
of
being
an
original
or
eminent
author
at
the
time
when
byron
published
the
satire
alluded
to
he
had
obtained
no
other
distinction
than
the
college
reputation
of
being
a
clever
careless
dissipated
student
but
his
dissipation
was
not
intense
nor
did
it
ever
become
habitual
he
affected
to
be
much
more
so
than
he
was
his
pretensions
were
moderated
by
constitutional
incapacity
his
health
was
not
vigorous
and
his
delicacy
defeated
his
endeavours
to
show
that
he
inherited
the
recklessness
of
his
father
he
affected
extravagance
and
eccentricity
of
conduct
without
yielding
much
to
the
one
or
practising
a
great
deal
of
the
other
he
was
seeking
notoriety
and
his
attempts
to
obtain
it
gave
more
method
to
his
pranks
and
follies
than
belonged
to
the
results
of
natural
impulse
and
passion
he
evinced
occasional
instances
of
the
generous
spirit
of
youth
but
there
was
in
them
more
of
ostentation
than
of
that
discrimination
which
dignifies
kindness
and
makes
prodigality
munificence
nor
were
his
attachments
towards
those
with
whom
he
preferred
to
associate
characterised
by
any
nobler
sentiment
than
indulgence
he
was
attached
more
from
the
pleasure
he
himself
received
in
their
society
than
from
any
reciprocal
enjoyment
they
had
with
him
as
he
became
a
man
of
the
world
his
early
friends
dropped
from
him
although
it
is
evident
by
all
the
contemporary
records
of
his
feelings
that
he
cherished
for
them
a
kind
and
even
brotherly
affection
this
secession
the
common
effect
of
the
new
cares
hopes
interests
and
wishes
which
young
men
feel
on
entering
the
world
byron
regarded
as
something
analogous
to
desertion
and
the
notion
tainted
his
mind
and
irritated
that
hereditary
sullenness
of
humour
which
constituted
an
ingredient
so
remarkable
in
the
composition
of
his
more
mature
character
an
anecdote
of
this
period
characteristic
of
his
eccentricity
and
the
means
which
he
scrupled
not
to
employ
in
indulging
it
deserves
to
be
mentioned
in
repairing

a

it
might
have
been

of

his

or
of

morose

it

a

and
used
at
orgies
though
the
affair
was
but
a
whim
of
youth
more
odious

poetical
it
caused
some
talk
and
raised
around

extravagant

haze
of

chapter
vii
effect
of
the
criticism
in
the
edinburgh
review
english
bards
and
scotch
reviewers
his
satiety
intention
to
travel
publishes
his
satire
takes
his
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
departs
for
lisbon
thence
to
gibraltar
the
impression
which
the
criticism
of
the
edinburgh
review
produced
upon
the
juvenile
poet
was
deep
and
envenomed
it
stung
his
heart
and
prompted
him
to
excess
but
the
paroxysms
did
not
endure
long
strong
volitions
of
revenge
succeeded
and
the
grasps
of
his
mind
were
filled
as
it
were
with
writhing
adders
all
the
world
knows
that
this
unquenchable
indignation
found
relief
in
the
composition
of
english
bards
and
scotch
reviewers
a
satire
which
in
many
passages
equals
in
fervour
and
force
the
most
vigorous
in
the
language
it
was
during
the
summer
of
while
the
poet
was
residing
at
newstead
that
english
bards
and
scotch
reviewers
was
principally
written
he
bestowed
more
pains
upon
it
than
perhaps
on
any
other
of
his
works
and
though
different
from
them
all
it
still
exhibits
strong
indications
of
the
misanthropy
with
which
after
quitting
cambridge
he
became
more
and
more
possessed
it
is
painful
to
reflect
in
considering
the
splendid
energy
displayed
in
the
poem
that
the
unprovoked
malice
which
directed
him
to
make
the
satire
so
general
was
perhaps
the
main
cause
of
that
disposition
to
wither
his
reputation
which
was
afterwards
so
fervently
roused
he
could
not
but
expect
that
in
stigmatising
with
contempt
and
ridicule
so
many
persons
by
name
some
of
them
would
retaliate
nor
could
he
complain
of
injustice
if
they
did
for
his
attack
was
so
wilful
that
the
rage
of
it
can
only
be
explained
by
supposing
he
was
instigated
to
the
one
fell
swoop
by
a
resentful
conviction
that
his
impillory
in
the
edinburgh
review
had
amused
them
all
i
do
not
conceive
that
the
generality
of
the
satire
can
be
well
extenuated
but
i
am
not
inclined
to
regard
it
as
having
been
a
very
heinous
offence
the
ability
displayed
in
it
is
a
sufficient
compensation
the
beauty
of
the
serpent
skin
appeases
the
aversion
to
its
nature
moreover
a
toothless
satire
is
verse
without
most
odious
of
all
respectable
things
but
without
regard
to
the
merits
or
delinquency
of
the
poem
to
the
acumen
of
its
animadversions
or
to
the
polish
of
the
lines
it
possesses
in
the
biography
of
the
author
a
value
of
the
most
interesting
kind
it
was
the
first
burst
of
that
dark
diseased
ichor
which
afterwards
coloured
his
effusions
the
overflowing
suppuration
of
that
satiety
and
loathing
which
rendered
childe
harold
in
particular
so
original
incomprehensible
and
antisocial
and
bears
testimony
to
the
state
of
his
feelings
at
that
important
epoch
while
he
was
yet
upon
the
threshold
of
the
world
and
was
entering
it
with
a
sense
of
failure
and
humiliation
and
premature
disgust
for
notwithstanding
his
unnecessary
expositions
concerning
his
dissipation
it
is
beyond
controversy
that
at
no
time
could
it
be
said
he
was
a
dissipated
young
man
that
he
indulged
in
occasional
excesses
is
true
but
his
habits
were
never
libertine
nor
did
his
health
or
stamina
permit
him
to
be
distinguished
in
licentiousness
the
declaration
in
which
he
first
discloses
his
sobriety
contains
more
truth
than
all
his
pretensions
to
his
father
qualities
i
took
my
gradations
in
the
vices
says
he
in
that
remarkable
confession
with
great
promptitude
but
they
were
not
to
my
taste
for
my
early
passions
though
violent
in
the
extreme
were
concentrated
and
hated
division
or
spreading
abroad
i
could
have
left
or
lost
the
whole
world
with
or
for
that
which
i
loved
but
though
my
temperament
was
naturally
burning
i
could
not
share
in
the
common
libertinism
of
the
place
and
time
without
disgust
and
yet
this
very
disgust
and
my
heart
thrown
back
upon
itself
threw
me
into
excesses
perhaps
more
fatal
than
those
from
which
i
shrunk
as
fixing
upon
one
at
a
time
the
passions
which
spread
among
many
would
have
hurt
only
myself
this
is
vague
and
metaphysical
enough
but
it
bears
corroborative
intimations
that
the
impression
which
he
early
made
upon
me
was
not
incorrect
he
was
vain
of
his
experiments
in
profligacy
but
they
never
grew
to
habitude
while
he
was
engaged
in
the
composition
of
his
satire
he
formed
a
plan
of
travelling
but
there
was
a
great
shortcoming
between
the
intention
and
the
performance
he
first
thought
of
persia
he
afterwards
resolved
to
sail
for
india
and
had
so
far
matured
this
project
as
to
write
for
information
to
the
arabic
professor
at
cambridge
and
to
his
mother
who
was
not
then
with
him
at
newstead
to
inquire
of
a
friend
who
had
resided
in
india
what
things
would
be
necessary
for
the
voyage
he
formed
his
plan
of
travelling
upon
different
reasons
from
those
which
he
afterward
gave
out
and
which
have
been
imputed
to
him
he
then
thought
that
all
men
should
in
some
period
of
their
lives
travel
he
had
at
that
time
no
tie
to
prevent
him
he
conceived
that
when
he
returned
home
he
might
be
induced
to
enter
into
political
life
to
which
his
having
travelled
would
be
an
advantage
and
he
wished
to
know
the
world
by
sight
and
to
judge
of
men
by
experience
when
his
satire
was
ready
for
the
press
he
carried
it
with
him
to
london
he
was
then
just
come
of
age
or
about
to
be
so
and
one
of
his
objects
in
this
visit
to
the
metropolis
was
to
take
his
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
before
going
abroad
but
in
advancing
to
this
proud
distinction
so
soothing
to
the
of
youth
he
was
destined
to
suffer
a
mortification
which
probably
wounded
him
as
deeply
as
the
sarcasms
of
the
edinburgh
review
before
the
meeting
of
parliament
he
wrote
to
his
relation
and
guardian
the
earl
of
carlisle
to
remind
him
that
he
should
be
of
age
at
the
commencement
of
the
session
in
the
natural
hope
that
his
lordship
would
make
an
offer
to
introduce
him
to
the
house
but
he
was
disappointed
he
only
received
a
formal
reply
acquainting
him
with
the
technical
mode
of
proceeding
and
the
etiquette
to
be
observed
on
such
occasions
it
is
therefore
not
wonderful
that
he
should
have
resented
such
treatment
and
he
avenged
it
by
those
lines
in
his
satire
for
which
he
afterwards
expressed
his
regret
in
the
third
canto
of
childe
harold
deserted
by
his
guardian
at
a
crisis
so
interesting
he
was
prevented
for
some
time
from
taking
his
seat
in
parliament
being
obliged
to
procure
affidavits
in
proof
of
his
grandfather
marriage
with
miss
trevannion
which
having
taken
place
in
a
private
chapel
at
carhais
no
regular
certificate
of
the
ceremony
could
be
produced
at
length
all
the
necessary
evidence
having
been
obtained
on
the
of
march
he
presented
himself
in
the
house
of
lords
alone
a
proceeding
consonant
to
his
character
for
he
was
not
so
friendless
nor
unknown
but
that
he
might
have
procured
some
peer
to
have
gone
with
him
it
however
served
to
make
his
introduction
remarkable
on
entering
the
house
he
is
described
to
have
appeared
abashed
and
pale
he
passed
the
woolsack
without
looking
round
and
advanced
to
the
table
where
the
proper
officer
was
attending
to
administer
the
oaths
when
he
had
gone
through
them
the
chancellor
quitted
his
seat
and
went
towards
him
with
a
smile
putting
out
his
hand
in
a
friendly
manner
to
welcome
him
but
he
made
a
stiff
bow
and
only
touched
with
the
tip
of
his
fingers
the
chancellor
hand
who
immediately
returned
to
his
seat
such
is
the
account
given
of
this
important
incident
by
mr
dallas
who
went
with
him
to
the
bar
but
a
characteristic
circumstance
is
wanting
when
lord
eldon
advanced
with
the
cordiality
described
he
expressed
with
becoming
courtesy
his
regret
that
the
rules
of
the
house
had
obliged
him
to
call
for
the
evidence
of
his
grandfather
your
lordship
has
done
your
duty
and
no
more
was
the
cold
reply
in
the
words
of
tom
thumb
and
which
probably
was
the
cause
of
the
marked
manner
of
the
chancellor
cool
return
to
his
seat
the
satire
was
published
anonymously
and
immediately
attracted
attention
the
sale
was
rapid
and
a
new
edition
being
called
for
byron
revised
it
the
preparations
for
his
travels
being
completed
he
then
embarked
in
july
of
the
same
year
with
mr
hobhouse
for
lisbon
and
thence
proceeded
by
the
southern
provinces
of
spain
to
gibraltar
in
the
account
of
his
adventures
during
this
journey
he
seems
to
have
felt
to
an
exaggerated
degree
the
hazards
to
which
he
was
exposed
but

then
animated

chapter
viii
first
acquaintance
with
byron
embark
together
the
voyage
it
was
at
gibraltar
that
i
first
fell
in
with
lord
byron
i
had
arrived
there
in
the
packet
from
england
in
indifferent
health
on
my
way
to
sicily
i
had
then
no
intention
of
travelling
i
only
went
a
trip
intending
to
return
home
after
spending
a
few
weeks
in
malta
sicily
and
sardinia
having
before
my
departure
entered
into
the
society
of
lincoln
inn
with
the
design
of
studying
the
law
at
this
time
my
friend
the
late
colonel
wright
of
the
artillery
was
secretary
to
the
governor
and
during
the
short
stay
of
the
packet
at
the
rock
he
invited
me
to
the
hospitalities
of
his
house
and
among
other
civilities
gave
me
admission
to
the
garrison
library
the
day
i
well
remember
was
exceedingly
sultry
the
air
was
sickly
and
if
the
wind
was
not
a
sirocco
it
was
a
withering
levanter
oppressive
to
the
functions
of
life
and
to
an
invalid
denying
all
exercise
instead
of
rambling
over
the
fortifications
i
was
in
consequence
constrained
to
spend
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
in
the
library
and
while
sitting
there
a
young
man
came
in
and
seated
himself
opposite
to
me
at
the
table
where
i
was
reading
something
in
his
appearance
attracted
my
attention
his
dress
indicated
a
londoner
of
some
fashion
partly
by
its
neatness
and
simplicity
with
just
so
much
of
a
peculiarity
of
style
as
served
to
show
that
although
he
belonged
to
the
order
of
metropolitan
beaux
he
was
not
altogether
a
common
one
i
thought
his
face
not
unknown
to
me
i
began
to
conjecture
where
i
could
have
seen
him
and
after
an
unobserved
scrutiny
to
speculate
both
as
to
his
character
and
vocation
his
physiognomy
was
prepossessing
and
intelligent
but
ever
and
anon
his
brows
lowered
and
gathered
a
habit
as
i
then
thought
with
a
degree
of
affectation
in
it
probably
first
assumed
for
picturesque
effect
and
energetic
expression
but
which
i
afterwards
discovered
was
undoubtedly
the
occasional
scowl
of
some
unpleasant
reminiscence
it
was
certainly
disagreeable
forbidding
but
still
the
general
cast
of
his
features
was
impressed
with
elegance
and
character
at
dinner
a
large
party
assembled
at
colonel
wright
among
others
the
countess
of
westmorland
with
tom
sheridan
and
his
beautiful
wife
and
it
happened
that
sheridan
in
relating
the
local
news
of
the
morning
mentioned
that
lord
byron
and
mr
hobhouse
had
come
in
from
spain
and
were
to
proceed
up
the
mediterranean
in
the
packet
he
was
not
acquainted
with
either
hobhouse
had
a
short
time
before
i
left
london
published
certain
translations
and
poems
rather
respectable
in
their
way
and
i
had
seen
the
work
so
that
his
name
was
not
altogether
strange
to
me
byron
was
familiar
the
edinburgh
review
had
made
it
so
and
still
more
the
satire
of
english
bards
and
scotch
reviewers
but
i
was
not
conscious
of
having
seen
the
persons
of
either
on
the
following
evening
i
embarked
early
and
soon
after
the
two
travellers
came
on
board
in
one
of
whom
i
recognised
the
visitor
to
the
library
and
he
proved
to
be
lord
byron
in
the
little
bustle
and
process
of
embarking
their
luggage
his
lordship
affected
as
it
seemed
to
me
more
aristocracy
than
befitted
his
years
or
the
occasion
and
i
then
thought
of
his
singular
scowl
and
suspected
him
of
pride
and
irascibility
the
impression
that
evening
was
not
agreeable
but
it
was
interesting
and
that
forehead
mark
the
frown
was
calculated
to
awaken
curiosity
and
beget
conjectures
hobhouse
with
more
of
the
commoner
made
himself
one
of
the
passengers
at
once
but
byron
held
himself
aloof
and
sat
on
the
rail
leaning
on
the
mizzen
shrouds
inhaling
as
it
were
poetical
sympathy
from
the
gloomy
rock
then
dark
and
stern
in
the
twilight
there
was
in
all
about
him
that
evening
much
waywardness
he
spoke
petulantly
to
fletcher
his
valet
and
was
evidently
ill
at
ease
with
himself
and
fretful
towards
others
i
thought
he
would
turn
out
an
unsatisfactory
shipmate
yet
there
was
something
redeeming
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
when
some
time
after
he
had
indulged
his
sullen
meditation
he
again
addressed
fletcher
so
that
instead
of
finding
him
i
was
soon
convinced
he
was
only
capricious
our
passage
to
sardinia
was
tardy
owing
to
calms
but
in
other
respects
pleasant
about
the
third
day
byron
relented
from
his
rapt
mood
as
if
he
felt
it
was
out
of
place
and
became
playful
and
disposed
to
contribute
his
fair
proportion
to
the
general
endeavour
to
wile
away
the
tediousness
of
the
dull
voyage
among
other
expedients
for
that
purpose
we
had
recourse
to
shooting
at
bottles
byron
i
think
supplied
the
pistols
and
was
the
best
shot
but
not
very
so
in
the
calms
the
was
several
times
lowered
and
on
one
of
those
occasions
his
lordship
with
the
captain
caught
a
turtle
i
rather
think
two
we
likewise
hooked
a
shark
part
of
which
was
dressed
for
breakfast
and
tasted
without
relish
your
shark
is
but
a
cannibal
dainty
as
we
approached
the
gulf
or
bay
of
cagliari
in
sardinia
a
strong
north
wind
came
from
the
shore
and
we
had
a
whole
disagreeable
day
of
tacking
but
next
morning
it
was
sunday
we
found
ourselves
at
anchor
near
the
mole
where
we
landed
byron
with
the
captain
rode
out
some
distance
into
the
country
while
i
walked
with
mr
hobhouse
about
the
town
we
left
our
cards
for
the
consul
and
mr
hill
the
ambassador
who
invited
us
to
dinner
in
the
evening
we
landed
again
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
invitation
and
on
this
occasion
byron
and
his
pylades
dressed
themselves
as
a
circumstance
which
at
the
time
did
not
tend
to
improve
my
estimation
of
the
solidity
of
the
character
of
either
but
such
is
the
force
of
habit
it
appeared
a
less
exceptionable
affectation
in
the
young
peer
than
in
the
commoner
had
we
parted
at
cagliari
it
is
probable
that
i
should
have
retained
a
much
more
favourable
recollection
of
mr
hobhouse
than
of
lord
byron
for
he
was
a
cheerful
companion
full
of
odd
and
droll
stories
which
he
told
extremely
well
he
was
also
and
intelligent
altogether
an
advantageous
specimen
of
a
english
gentleman
moreover
i
was
at
the
time
afflicted
with
a
nervous
dejection
which
the
occasional
exhilaration
produced
by
his
anecdotes
and
college
tales
often
materially
dissipated
though
for
the
most
part
they
were
more
after
the
manner
and
matter
of
swift
than
of
addison
byron
was
during
the
passage
in
delicate
health
and
upon
an
abstemious
regimen
he
rarely
tasted
wine
nor
more
than
half
a
glass
mingled
with
water
when
he
did
he
ate
little
no
animal
food
but
only
bread
and
vegetables
he
reminded
me
of
the
ghoul
that
picked
rice
with
a
needle
for
it
was
manifest
that
he
had
not
acquired
his
knowledge
of
the
world
by
always
dining
so
sparely
if
my
remembrance
is
not
treacherous
he
only
spent
one
evening
in
the
cabin
with
us
the
evening
before
we
came
to
anchor
at
cagliari
for
when
the
lights
were
placed
he
made
himself
a
man
forbid
took
his
station
on
the
railing
between
the
pegs
on
which
the
sheets
are
belayed
and
the
shrouds
and
there
for
hours
sat
in
silence
enamoured
it
may
be
of
the
moon
all
these
peculiarities
with
his
caprices
and
something
inexplicable
in
the
cast
of
his
metaphysics
while
they
served
to
awaken
interest
contributed
little
to
conciliate
esteem
he
was
often
strangely
rapt
it
may
have
been
from
his
genius
and
had
its
grandeur
and
darkness
been
then
divulged
susceptible
of
explanation
but
at
the
time
it
threw
as
it
were
around
him
the
sackcloth
of
penitence
sitting
amid
the
shrouds
and
rattlins
in
the
tranquillity
of
the
moonlight
churming
an
inarticulate
melody
he
seemed
almost
apparitional
suggesting
dim
reminiscences
of
him
who
shot
the
albatross
he
was
as
a
mystery
in
a
crowned
with
a
halo
the
influence
of
the
incomprehensible
phantasma
which
hovered
about
lord
byron
has
been
more
or
less
felt
by
all
who
ever
approached
him
that
he
sometimes
came
out
of
the
cloud
and
was
familiar
and
earthly
is
true
but
his
dwelling
was
amid
the
murk
and
the
mist
and
the
home
of
his
spirit
in
the
abysm
of
the
storm
and
the
places
of
guilt
he
was
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
scarcely
and
could
claim
no
higher
praise
than
having
written
a
clever
satire
and
yet
it
was
impossible
even
then
to
reflect
on
the
bias
of
his
mind
as
it
was
revealed
by
the
casualties
of
conversation
without
experiencing
a
presentiment
that
he
was
destined
to
execute
some
singular
and
ominous
purpose
the
description
he
has
given
of
manfred
in
his
youth
was
of
himself
my
spirit
walk
not
with
the
souls
of
men
nor
look
upon
the
earth
with
human
eyes
the
thirst
of
their
ambition
was
not
mine
the
aim
of
their
existence
was
not
mine
my
joys
my
griefs
my
passions
and
my
powers
made
me
a
stranger
though
i
wore
the
form
i
had
no
sympathy
with
breathing
flesh
my
joy
was
in
the
wilderness
to
breathe
the
difficult
air
of
the
iced
mountain
top
where
the
birds
dare
not
build
nor
insect
wing
flit
the
herbless
granite
or
to
plunge
into
the
torrent
and
to
roll
along
on
the
swift
whirl
of
the
wave
of
river
stream
or
ocean
in
their
flow
in
these
my
early
strength
exulted
or
to
follow
through
the
night
the
moving
moon
the
stars
and
their
development
or
catch
the
dazzling
lightnings
till
my
eyes
grew
dim
or
to
look
listening
on
the
scatter
leaves
while
autumn
winds
were
at
their
evening
song
these
were
my
pastimes
and
to
be
alone
for
if
the
beings
of
whom
i
was
one
hating
to
be
so
cross
me
in
my
path
i
felt
myself
degraded
back
to
them
and
was
all
clay
again
chapter
ix
dinner
at
the
ambassador
opera
disaster
of
byron
at
malta
mrs
spencer
smith
i
shall
always
remember
cagliari
with
particular
pleasure
for
it
so
happened
that
i
formed
there
three
of
the
most
agreeable
acquaintances
of
my
life
and
one
of
them
was
with
lord
byron
for
although
we
had
been
eight
days
together
i
yet
could
not
previously
have
accounted
myself
acquainted
with
his
lordship
after
dinner
we
all
went
to
the
theatre
which
was
that
evening
on
account
of
some
court
festival
brilliantly
illuminated
the
royal
family
were
present
and
the
opera
was
performed
with
more
taste
and
execution
than
i
had
expected
to
meet
with
in
so
remote
a
place
and
under
the
restrictions
which
rendered
the
intercourse
with
the
continent
then
so
difficult
among
other
remarkable
characters
pointed
out
to
us
was
a
nobleman
in
the
pit
actually
under
the
ban
of
outlawry
for
murder
i
have
often
wondered
if
the
incident
had
any
effect
on
the
creation
of
lara
for
we
know
not
in
what
small
germs
the
conceptions
of
genius
originate
but
the
most
important
occurrence
of
that
evening
arose
from
a
delicate
observance
of
etiquette
on
the
part
of
the
ambassador
after
carrying
us
to
his
box
which
was
close
to
that
of
the
royal
family
in
order
that
we
might
see
the
members
of
it
properly
he
retired
with
lord
byron
to
another
box
an
inflection
of
manners
to
propriety
in
the
best
possible
taste
for
the
ambassador
was
doubtless
aware
that
his
lordship
rank
would
be
known
to
the
audience
and
i
conceive
that
this
little
arrangement
was
adopted
to
make
his
person
also
known
by
showing
him
with
distinction
apart
from
the
other
strangers
when
the
performance
was
over
mr
hill
came
down
with
lord
byron
to
the
gate
of
the
upper
town
where
his
lordship
as
we
were
taking
leave
thanked
him
with
more
elocution
than
was
precisely
requisite
the
style
and
formality
of
the
speech
amused
mr
hobhouse
as
well
as
others
and
when
the
minister
retired
he
began
to
rally
his
lordship
on
the
subject
but
byron
really
fancied
that
he
had
acquitted
himself
with
grace
and
dignity
and
took
the
jocularity
of
his
friend
amiss
a
little
banter
ensued
the
poet
became
petulant
and
mr
hobhouse
walked
on
while
byron
on
account
of
his
lameness
and
the
roughness
of
the
pavement
took
hold
of
my
arm
appealing
to
me
if
he
could
have
said
less
after
the
kind
and
hospitable
treatment
we
had
all
received
of
course
though
i
thought
pretty
much
as
mr
hobhouse
did
i
could
not
do
otherwise
than
civilly
assent
especially
as
his
lordship
comfort
at
the
moment
seemed
in
some
degree
dependent
on
being
confirmed
in
the
good
opinion
he
was
desirous
to
entertain
of
his
own
courtesy
from
that
night
i
evidently
rose
in
his
good
graces
and
as
he
was
always
most
agreeable
and
interesting
when
familiar
it
was
worth
my
while
to
advance
but
by
cautious
circumvallations
into
his
intimacy
for
his
uncertain
temper
made
his
favour
precarious
the
next
morning
either
owing
to
the
relaxation
of
his
abstinence
which
he
could
not
probably
well
avoid
amid
the
good
things
of
the
ambassadorial
table
or
what
was
perhaps
less
questionable
some
regret
for
his
petulance
towards
his
friend
he
was
indisposed
and
did
not
make
his
appearance
till
late
in
the
evening
i
rather
suspect
though
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
fact
that
hobhouse
received
any
concession
which
he
may
have
made
with
indulgence
for
he
remarked
to
me
in
a
tone
that
implied
both
forbearance
and
generosity
of
regard
that
it
was
necessary
to
humour
him
like
a
child
but
in
whatever
manner
the
reconciliation
was
accomplished
the
passengers
partook
of
the
blessings
of
the
peace
byron
during
the
following
day
as
we
were
sailing
along
the
picturesque
shores
of
sicily
was
in
the
highest
spirits
overflowing
with
glee
and
sparkling
with
quaint
sentences
the
champagne
was
uncorked
and
in
the
finest
condition
having
landed
the
mail
at
girgenti
we
stretched
over
to
malta
where
we
arrived
about
noon
next
day
all
the
passengers
except
orestes
and
pylades
being
eager
to
land
went
on
shore
with
the
captain
they
remained
behind
for
a
reason
which
an
accidental
expression
of
byron
let
out
much
to
my
secret
amusement
for
i
was
aware
they
would
be
disappointed
and
the
anticipation
was
relishing
they
expected
at
least
he
did
a
salute
from
the
batteries
and
sent
ashore
notice
to
sir
alexander
ball
the
governor
of
his
arrival
but
the
guns
were
sulky
and
evinced
no
respect
of
persons
so
that
late
in
the
afternoon
about
the
heel
of
the
evening
the
two
magnates
were
obliged
to
come
on
shore
and
slip
into
the
city
unnoticed
and
unknown
at
this
time
malta
was
in
great
prosperity
her
commerce
was
flourishing
and
the
goodly
clusters
of
its
profits
hung
ripe
and
rich
at
every
door
the
merchants
were
truly
hospitable
and
few
more
so
than
mr
chabot
as
i
had
letters
to
him
he
invited
me
to
dinner
along
with
several
other
friends
previously
engaged
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
as
we
were
sitting
at
our
wine
lord
byron
and
mr
hobhouse
were
announced
his
lordship
was
in
better
spirits
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
his
appearance
showed
as
he
entered
the
room
that
they
had
met
with
some
adventure
and
he
chuckled
with
an
inward
sense
of
enjoyment
not
altogether
without
spleen
a
kind
of
malicious
satisfaction
as
his
companion
recounted
with
all
becoming
gravity
their
woes
and
sufferings
as
an
apology
for
begging
a
bed
and
morsel
for
the
night
god
forgive
me
but
i
partook
of
levity
at
the
idea
of
personages
so
consequential
wandering
destitute
in
the
streets
seeking
for
lodgings
as
it
were
from
door
to
door
and
rejected
at
all
next
day
however
they
were
accommodated
by
the
governor
with
an
agreeable
house
in
the
upper
part
of
valetta
and
his
lordship
as
soon
as
they
were
domiciled
began
to
take
lessons
in
arabic
from
a
monk
i
believe
one
of
the
librarians
of
the
public
library
his
whole
time
was
not
however
devoted
to
study
for
he
formed
an
acquaintance
with
mrs
spencer
smith
the
lady
of
the
gentleman
of
that
name
who
had
been
our
resident
minister
at
constantinople
he
affected
a
passion
for
her
but
it
was
only
platonic
she
however
beguiled
him
of
his
valuable
yellow
diamond
ring
she
is
the
florence
of
childe
harold
and
merited
the
poetical
embalmment
or
rather
the
amber
immortalisation
she
possesses
there
being
herself
a
heroine
there
was
no
exaggeration
in
saying
that
many
incidents
of
her
life
would
appear
improbable
in
fiction
her
adventures
with
the
marquis
de
salvo
form
one
of
the
prettiest
romances
in
the
italian
language
everything
in
her
destiny
was
touched
with
adventure
nor
was
it
the
least
of
her
claims
to
sympathy
that
she
had
incurred
the
special
enmity
of
napoleon
after
remaining
about
three
weeks
at
malta
byron
embarked
with
his
friend
in
a
brig
of
war
appointed
to
convoy
a
fleet
of
small
merchantmen
to
prevesa
i
had
about
a
fortnight
before
passed
over
with
the
packet
on
her
return
from
messina
to
girgenti
and
did
not
fall
in
with
them
again
till
the
following
spring
when
we
met
at
athens
in
the
meantime
besides
his
platonic
dalliance
with
mrs
spencer
smith
byron
had
involved
himself
in
a
quarrel
with
an
officer
but
it
was
satisfactorily
settled
his
residence
at
malta
did
not
greatly
interest
him
the
story
of
its
chivalrous
masters
made
no
impression
on
his
imagination
none
that
appears
in
his
works
but
it
is
not
the
less
probable
that
the
remembrance
of
the
place
itself
occupied
a
deep
niche
in
his
bosom
for
i
have
remarked
that
he
had
a
voluntary
power
of
forgetfulness
which
on
more
than
one
occasion
struck
me
as
singular
and
i
am
led
in
consequence
to
think
that
something
unpleasant
connected
with
this
quarrel
may
have
been
the
cause
of
his
suppression
of
all
direct
allusion
to
the
island
it
was
impossible
that
his
imagination
could
avoid
the
impulses
of
the
spirit
which
haunts
the
walls
and
ramparts
of
malta
and
the
silence
of
his
muse
on
a
topic
so
rich
in
romance
and
so
well
calculated
to
awaken
associations
concerning
the
knights
in
unison
with
the
ruminations
of
childe
harold
persuades
me
that
there
must
have
been
some
specific
cause
for
the
omission
if
it
were
nothing
in
the
duel
i
should
be
inclined
to
say
notwithstanding
the
seeming
improbability
of
the
notion
that
it
was
owing
to
some
curious
modification
of
vindictive
spite
it
might
not
be
that
malta
should
receive
no
celebrity
from
his
pen
but
assuredly
he
had
met
with
something
there
which
made
him
resolute
to
forget
the
place
the
question
as
to
what
it
was
he
never
answered
the
result
would
throw
light
into
the
labyrinths
of
his
character

the

calculated
to
bespeak

the
novelty
in

produced
an
immediate
effect

the

towards
him

gallery

on

by
mr
hobhouse
they
had
provided
themselves
with

to

as

with
this
person
they
soon
became
dissatisfied
in

because
of

should

ingenious

prompt
and
resolute
in
the
qualifications
of
this
essential
servant
the
travellers
were
not
fortunate
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
pilfering
he
was
however
zealous
bustling
and
talkative
and
withal
and
having
his
mind
intent
on

object
making
money
was
never
lazy
nor

nor

on
the
of
october
they
embarked
and
sailed
up
the
gulf
of
salona
where
they
were
shown
into
an
empty
barrack
for
lodgings
in
this
habitation
twelve
albanian
soldiers
and
an
officer
were
quartered
who
behaved
towards
them
with
civility
on
their
entrance
the
officer
gave
them
pipes
and
coffee
and
after
they
had
dined
in
their
own
apartment
he
invited
them
to
spend
the
evening
with
him
and
they
condescended
to
partake
of
his
hospitality
such
instances
as
these
in
ordinary
biography
would
be
without
interest
but
when
it
is
considered
how
firmly
the
impression
of
them
was
retained
in
the
mind
of
the
poet
and
how
intimately
they
entered
into
the
substance
of
his
reminiscences
of

they
acquire
dignity
and
become
epochal
in
the
history

says
mr

strut
very
much
when
they
walk
projecting
their
chests
throwing
back
their
heads
and
moving
very
slowly
from
side
to
side
elmas
as
the
officer
was
called
had
this
strut
more
than
any
man
perhaps
we
saw
afterwards
and
as
the
sight
was
then
quite
new
to
us
we
could
not
help
staring
at
the
magisterial
and
superlatively
dignified
air
of
a
man
with
great
holes
in
his
elbows
and
looking
altogether
as
to
his
garment
like
what
we
call
a
mr
hobhouse
describes
him
as
a
captain
but
by
the
number
of
men
under
him
he
could
have
been
of
no
higher
rank
than
serjeant
captains
are
centurions
after
supper
the
officer
washed
his
hands
with
soap
inviting
the
travellers
to
do
the
same
for
they
had
eaten
a
little
with
him
he
did
not
however
give
the
soap
but
put
it
on
the
floor
with
an
air
so
remarkable
as
to
induce
mr
hobhouse
to
inquire
the
meaning
of
it
and
he
was
informed
that
there
is
a
superstition
in
turkey
against
giving
soap
it
is
thought
it
will
wash
away
love
next
day
it
rained
and
the
travellers
were
obliged
to
remain
under
shelter
the
evening
was
again
spent
with
the
soldiers
who
did
their
utmost
to
amuse
them
with
greek
and
albanian
songs
and
freaks
of
jocularity
in
the
morning
of
the
of
october
they
set
out
for
arta
with
ten
horses
four
for
themselves
and
servants
four
for
their
luggage
and
two
for
two
soldiers
whom
they
were
induced
to
take
with
them
as
guards
byron
takes
no
notice
of
his
visit
to
arta
in
childe
harold
but
mr
hobhouse
has
given
a
minute
account
of
the
town
they
met
there
with
nothing
remarkable
the
remainder
of
the
journey
to
joannina
the
capital
then
of
the
famous
ali
pasha
was
rendered
unpleasant
by
the
wetness
of
the
weather
still
it
was
impossible
to
pass
through
a
country
so
picturesque
in
its
features
and
rendered
romantic
by
the
traditions
of
robberies
and
conflicts
without
receiving
impressions
of
that
kind
of
imagery
which
constitutes
the
embroidery
on
the
vestment
of
poetry
the
first
view
of
joannina
seen
in
the
morning
light
or
glittering
in
the
setting
sun
is
lively
and
alluring
the
houses
domes
and
minarets
shining
through
gardens
of
orange
and
lemon
trees
and
groves
of
cypresses
the
lake
spreading
its
broad
mirror
at
the
foot
of
the
town
and
the
mountains
rising
abrupt
around
all
combined
to
present
a
landscape
new
and
beautiful
indeed
where
may
be
its
parallel
the
lake
was
the
acherusian
mount
pindus
was
in
sight
and
the
elysian
fields
of
mythology
spread
in
the
lovely
plains
over
which
they
passed
in
approaching
the
town
on
entering
joannina
they
were
appalled
by
a
spectacle
characteristic
of
the
country
opposite
a
butcher
shop
they
beheld
hanging
from
the
boughs
of
a
tree
a
man
arm
with
part
of
the
side
torn
from
the
body
how
long
is
it

in
the
very

of

was
adorned
with
the
skulls
of
the
scottish
noblemen
who
were
beheaded
for
their
loyalty
to
the
son
and
representative
of
their
ancient
kings
the
object
of
the
visit
to
joannina
was
to
see
ali
pasha
in
those
days
the
most
celebrated
vizier
in
all
the
western
provinces
of
the
ottoman
empire
but
he
was
then
at
tepellene
the
luxury
of
resting
however
in
a
capital
was
not
to
be
resisted
and
they
accordingly
suspended
their
journey
until
they
had
satisfied
their
curiosity
with
an
inspection
of
every
object
which
merited
attention
of
joannina
it
may
be
said
they
were
almost
the
discoverers
so
little
was
known
of
it
in
england
i
may
say
in
western
europe
previous
to
their
visit
the
palace
and
establishment
of
ali
pasha
were
of
regal
splendour
combining
with
oriental
pomp
the
elegance
of
the
occident
and
the
travellers
were
treated
by
the
vizier
officers
with
all
the
courtesy
due
to
the
rank
of
lord
byron
and
every
facility
was
afforded
them
to
prosecute
their
journey
the
weather
however
the
season
being
far
advanced
was
wet
and
unsettled
and
they
suffered
more
fatigue
and
annoyance
than
travellers
for
information
or
pleasure
should
have
had
to
encounter
the
journey

travellers
on

to

after
some
parley
with
one
of
the
monks
through
a
small
grating
in
a
door
plated
with
iron
on
which
marks
of
violence
were
visible
and
which
before
the
country
had
been
tranquillised
under
the
vigorous
dominion
of
ali
pasha
had
been
frequently
battered
in
vain
by
the
robbers
who
then
infested
the
neighbourhood

meek
and

man
entertained
them
in
a

chamber

halted
a
night
at

the
travellers
proceeded
on
their
journey
next
morning
by
a
road
which
led
through
the
vineyards
around
the
villages
and
the
view
from
a
barren
hill
which
they
were
obliged
to
cross

of

they
crossed
in

route
is
now
called
the
kalamas
a
considerable
stream
as
large
as
the
avon
at
bath
but
towards
the
evening
they
had
some
cause
to
think
the
acheron
had
not
lost
all
its
original
horror
for
a
dreadful
thunderstorm
came
on
accompanied
with
deluges
of
rain
which
more
than
once
nearly
carried
away
their
luggage
and
horses
byron
himself
does
not
notice
this
incident
in
childe
harold
nor
even
the
adventure
more
terrific
which
he
met
with
alone
in
similar
circumstances
on
the
night
before
their
arrival
at
zitza
when
his
guides
lost
their
way
in
the
defiles
of
the
mountains
adventures
sufficiently
disagreeable
in
the
advent
but
full
of
poesy
in
the
remembrance
the
first
halt
after
leaving
zitza
was
at
the
little
village
of
mosure
where
they
were
lodged
in
a
miserable
cabin
the
residence
of
a
poor
priest
who
treated
them
with
all
the
kindness
his
humble
means
afforded
from
this
place
they
proceeded
next
morning
through
a
wild
and
savage
country
interspersed
with
vineyards
to
delvinaki
where
it
would
seem
they
first
met
with
genuine
greek
wine
that
is
wine
mixed
with
resin
and
lime
a
more
odious
draught
at
the
first
taste
than
any
drug
the
apothecary
mixes
considering
how
much
of
allegory
entered
into
the
composition
of
the
greek
mythology
it
is
probable
that
in
representing
the
infant
bacchus
holding
a
pine
the
ancient
sculptors
intended
an
impersonation
of
the
circumstance
of
resin
being
employed
to
preserve
new
wine
the
travellers
were
now
in
albania
the
native
region
of
ali
pasha
whom
they
expected
to
find
at
libokavo
but
on
entering
the
town
they
were
informed
that
he
was
further
up
the
country
at
tepellene
or
tepalen
his
native
place
in
their
route
from
libokavo
to
tepalen
they
met
with
no
adventure
nor
did
they
visit
which
they
saw
some
nine
or
ten
miles
off
a
large
city
supposed
to
contain
about
twenty
thousand
inhabitants
chiefly
turks
when
they
reached
cezarades
a
distance
of
not
more
than
nine
miles
which
had
taken
them
five
hours
to
travel
they
were
agreeably
accommodated
for
the
night
in
a
neat
cottage
and
the
albanian
landlord
in
whose
demeanour
they
could
discern
none
of
that
cringing
downcast
sinister
look
which
marked
the
degraded
greek
received
them
with
a
hearty
welcome
next
morning
they
resumed
their
journey
and
halted
one
night
more
before
they
reached
tepellene
in
approaching
which
they
met
a
carriage
not
inelegantly
constructed
after
the
german
fashion
with
a
man
on
the
box
driving
and
two
albanian
soldiers
standing
on
the
footboard
behind
they
were
floundering
on
at
a
trot
through
mud
and
mire
boldly
regardless
of
danger
but
it
seemed
to
the
english
eyes
of
the
travellers
impossible
that
such
a
vehicle
should
ever
be
able
to
reach
libokavo
to
which
it
was
bound
in
due
time
they
crossed
the
river
laos
or
voioutza
which
was
then
full
and
appeared
both
to
byron
and
his
friend
as
broad
as
the
thames
at
westminster
after
crossing
it
on
a
stone
bridge
they
came
in
sight
of
tepellene
when
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
vast
tomerit
and
laos
wide
and
fierce
came
roaring
by
the
shades
of
wonted
night
were
gathering
yet
when
down
the
steep
banks
winding
warily
childe
harold
saw
like
meteors
in
the
sky
the
glittering
minarets
of
tepalen
whose
walls
the
stream
and
drawing
nigh
he
heard
the
busy
hum
of
swelling
the
breeze
that
sigh
along
the
lengthening
glen
on
their
arrival
they
proceeded
at
once
to
the
residence
of
ali
pasha
an
extensive
rude
pile
where
they
witnessed
a
scene
not
dissimilar
to
that
which
they
might
perhaps
have
beheld
some
hundred
years
ago
in
the
of
a
great
feudal
baron
soldiers
with
their
arms
piled
against
the
wall
were
assembled
in
different
parts
of
the
court
several
horses
completely
caparisoned
were
led
about
others
were
neighing
under
the
hands
of
the
grooms
and
for
the
feast
of
the
night
armed
cooks
were
busy
dressing
kids
and
sheep
the
scene
is
described
with
the
poet
liveliest
pencil
richly
caparison
a
ready
row
of
armed
horse
and
many
a
warlike
store
circled
the
wide
extending
court
below
above
strange
groups
adorn
the
corridor
and
ofttimes
through
the
area
echoing
door
some
tartar
spurr
his
steed
away
the
turk
the
greek
the
albanian
and
the
moor
here
mingled
in
their
array
while
the
deep
sound
announced
the
close
of
day
some
recline
in
groups
scanning
the
motley
scene
that
varies
round
there
some
grave
moslem
to
devotion
stoops
and
some
that
smoke
and
some
that
play
are
found
here
the
albanian
proudly
treads
the
ground
there
the
greek
is
heard
to
prate
hark
from
the
mosque
the
nightly
solemn
sound
the
muezzin
call
doth
shake
the
minaret
there
is
no
god
but
god
to
prayer
lo
god
is
great
the
peculiar
quietness
and
ease
with
which
the
mahommedans
say
their
prayers
struck
the
travellers
as
one
of
the
most
peculiar
characteristics
which
they
had
yet
witnessed
of
that
people
some
of
the
graver
sort
began
their
devotions
in
the
places
where
they
were
sitting
undisturbed
and
unnoticed
by
those
around
them
who
were
otherwise
engaged
the
prayers
last
about
ten
minutes
they
are
not
uttered
aloud
but
generally
in
a
low
voice
sometimes
with
only
a
motion
of
the
lips
and
whether
performed
in
the
public
street
or
in
a
room
attract
no
attention
from
the
bystanders
of
more
than
a
hundred
of
the
guards
in
the
gallery
of
the
vizier
mansion
at
tepellene
not
more
than
five
or
six
were
seen
at
prayers
the
albanians
are
not
reckoned
strict
mahommedans
but
no
turk
however
irreligious
himself
ever
disturbs
the
devotion
of
others
it
was
then
the
fast
of
ramazan
and
the
travellers
during
the
night
were
annoyed
with
the
perpetual
noise
of
the
carousal
kept
up
in
the
gallery
and
by
the
drum
and
the
occasional
voice
of
the
muezzin
just
at
this
season
ramazani
fast
through
the
long
day
its
penance
did
maintain
but
when
the
lingering
twilight
hour
was
past
revel
and
feast
assumed
the
rule
again
now
all
was
bustle
and
the
menial
train
prepared
and
spread
the
plenteous
board
within
the
vacant
gallery
now
seem
made
in
vain
but
from
the
chambers
came
the
mingling
din
and
page
and
slave
anon
were
passing
out
and
in
chapter
xii
audience
appointed
with
ali
pasha
description
of
the
person
an
audience
of
the
vizier
of
the
morea
the
progress
of
no
other
poet
mind
can
be
to
clearly
traced
to
personal
experience
as
that
of
byron
the
minute
details
in
the
pilgrimage
of
childe
harold
are
the
observations
of
an
actual
traveller
had
they
been
given
in
prose
they
could
not
have
been
less
imbued
with
fiction
from
this
fidelity
they
possess
a
value
equal
to
the
excellence
of
the
poetry
and
ensure
for
themselves
an
interest
as
lasting
as
it
is
intense
when
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
inhabitants
shall
have
been
changed
by
time
and
the
vicissitudes
of
society
the
scenery
and
the
mountains
will
bear
testimony
to
the
accuracy
of
lord
byron
descriptions
the
day
after
the
travellers
arrival
at
tepellene
was
fixed
by
the
vizier
for
their
first
audience
and
about
noon
the
time
appointed
an
officer
of
the
palace
with
a
white
wand
announced
to
them
that
his
highness
was
ready
to
receive
them
and
accordingly
they
proceeded
from
their
own
apartment
accompanied
by
the
secretary
of
the
vizier
and
attended
by
their
own
dragoman
the
usher
of
the
white
rod
led
the
way
and
conducted
them
through
a
suite
of
apartments
to
the
presence
chamber
ali
when
they
entered
was
standing
a
courtesy
of
marked
distinction
from
a
turk
as
they
advanced
towards
him
he
seated
himself
and
requested
them
to
sit
near
him
the
room
was
spacious
and
handsomely
fitted
up
surrounded
by
that
species
of
continued
sofa
which
the
upholsterers
call
a
divan
covered
with
velvet
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
was
a
large
marble
basin
in
which
a
fountain
was
playing
in
pavilion
where
a
spring
of
living
water
from
the
centre
rose
whose
bubbling
did
a
genial
freshness
fling
and
soft
voluptuous
couches
breathed
repose
ali
reclined
a
man
of
war
and
woes
yet
in
his
lineaments
ye
can
not
trace
while
gentleness
her
milder
radiance
throws
along
that
aged
venerable
face
the
deeds
that
lurk
beneath
and
stain
him
with
disgrace
it
is
not
that
yon
hoary
lengthening
beard
ill
suits
the
passions
that
belong
to
youth
love
conquers
age
so
hafiz
hath
averr
so
sings
the
teian
and
he
sings
in
sooth
but
crimes
that
scorn
the
tender
voice
of
ruth
beseeming
all
men
ill
but
most
the
man
in
years
have
mark
him
with
a
tiger
tooth
blood
follows
blood
and
through
their
mortal
span
in
bloodier
acts
conclude
those
who
with
blood
began
when
this
was
written
ali
pasha
was
still
living
but
the
prediction
which
it
implies
was
soon
after
verified
and
he
closed
his
stern
and
energetic
life
with
a
catastrophe
worthy
of
its
guilt
and
bravery
he
voluntarily
perished
by
firing
a
when
surrounded
beyond
all
chance
of
escape
by
the
troops
of
the
sultan
his
master
whose
authority
he
had
long
contemned
mr
hobhouse
describes
him
at
this
audience
as
a
short
fat
man
about
five
feet
five
inches
in
height
with
a
very
pleasing
face
fair
and
round
and
blue
fair
eyes
not
settled
into
a
turkish
gravity
his
beard
was
long
and
hoary
and
such
a
one
as
any
other
turk
would
have
been
proud
of
nevertheless
he
who
was
more
occupied
in
attending
to
his
guests
than
himself
neither
gazed
at
it
smelt
it
nor
stroked
it
according
to
the
custom
of
his
countrymen
when
they
seek
to
fill
up
the
pauses
in
conversation
he
was
not
dressed
with
the
usual
magnificence
of
dignitaries
of
his
degree
except
that
his
high
turban
composed
of
many
small
rolls
was
of
golden
muslin
and
his
yataghan
studded
with
diamonds
he
was
civil
and
urbane
in
the
entertainment
of
his
guests
and
requested
them
to
consider
themselves
as
his
children
it
was
on
this
occasion
he
told
lord
byron
that
he
discovered
his
noble
blood
by
the
smallness
of
his
hands
and
ears
a
remark
which
has
become
proverbial
and
is
acknowledged
not
to
be
without
truth
in
the
evidence
of
pedigree
the
ceremonies
on
such
visits
are
similar
all
over
turkey
among
personages
of
the
same
rank
and
as
lord
byron
has
not
described
in
verse
the
details
of
what
took
place
with
him
it
will
not
be
altogether
obtrusive
here
to
recapitulate
what
happened
to
myself
during
a
visit
to
velhi
pasha
the
son
of
ali
he
was
then
vizier
of
the
morea
and
residing
at
tripolizza
in
the
afternoon
about
four
i
set
out
for
the
seraglio
with
dr
teriano
the
vizier
physician
and
the
vizier
italian
secretary
the
gate
of
the
palace
was
not
unlike
the
entrance
to
some
of
the
closes
in
edinburgh
and
the
court
within
reminded
me
of
smithfield
in
london
but
it
was
not
surrounded
by
such
lofty
buildings
nor
in
any
degree
of
comparison
so
well
constructed
we
ascended
a
ruinous
staircase
which
led
to
an
open
gallery
where
three
or
four
hundred
of
the
vizier
albanian
guards
were
lounging
in
an
antechamber
which
opened
from
the
gallery
a
number
of
officers
were
smoking
and
in
the
middle
on
the
floor
two
old
turks
were
seriously
engaged
at
chess
my
name
being
sent
in
to
the
vizier
a
guard
of
ceremony
was
called
and
after
they
had
arranged
themselves
in
the
presence
chamber
i
was
admitted
the
doctor
and
the
secretary
having
in
the
meantime
taken
off
their
shoes
accompanied
me
in
to
act
as
interpreters
the
presence
chamber
was
about
forty
feet
square
showy
and
handsome
round
the
walls
were
placed
sofas
which
from
being
covered
with
scarlet
reminded
me
of
the
woolsacks
in
the
house
of
lords
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
elevated
on
a
crimson
velvet
cushion
sat
the
vizier
wrapped
in
a
superb
pelisse
on
his
head
was
a
vast
turban
in
his
belt
a
dagger
incrusted
with
jewels
and
on
the
little
finger
of
his
right
hand
he
wore
a
solitaire
as
large
as
the
knob
on
the
stopper
of
a
and
which
was
said
to
have
cost
two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
sterling
in
his
left
hand
he
held
a
string
of
small
coral
beads
a
comboloio
which
he
twisted
backwards
and
forwards
during
the
greater
part
of
the
visit
on
the
sofa
beside
him
lay
a
pair
of
pistols
at
some
distance
on
the
same
sofa
but
not
on
a
cushion
sat
memet
the
pasha
of
napoli
romania
whose
son
was
contracted
in
marriage
to
the
vizier
daughter
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
this
pasha
and
opposite
to
the
vizier
a
secretary
was
writing
despatches
these
were
the
only
persons
in
the
room
who
had
the
honour
of
being
seated
for
according
to
the
etiquette
of
this
viceregal
court
those
who
received
the
vizier
pay
were
not
allowed
to
sit
down
in
his
presence
on
my
entrance
his
highness
motioned
to
me
to
sit
beside
him
and
through
the
medium
of
the
interpreters
began
with
some
commonplace
courtly
insignificancies
as
a
prelude
to
more
interesting
conversation
in
his
manners
i
found
him
free
and
affable
with
a
considerable
tincture
of
humour
and
drollery
among
other
questions
he
inquired
if
i
had
a
wife
and
being
answered
in
the
negative
he
replied
to
me
himself
in
italian
that
i
was
a
happy
man
for
he
found
his
very
troublesome
considering
their
probable
number
this
was
not
unlikely
pipes
and
coffee
were
in
the
served
the
pipe
presented
to
the
vizier
was
at
least
twelve
feet
long
the
was
formed
of
a
single
block
of
amber
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
cucumber
and
fastened
to
the
shaft
by
a
broad
hoop
of
gold
decorated
with
jewels
while
the
pipes
and
coffee

so
until
this
ceremony
was
over
the
coffee
was
literally
a
drop
of
dregs
in
a
very
small
china
cup
placed
in
a

his

with

the

elegantly
eructed
in
his
face
after
the
regale
of
the
pipes
and
coffee
the
attendants
withdrew
and
his
highness
began
a
kind
of
political
discussion
in
which
though
making
use
of
an
interpreter
he
managed
to
convey
his
questions
with
delicacy
and
address
on
my
rising
to
retire
his
highness
informed
me
with
more
polite
condescension
than
a
christian
of
a
thousandth
part
of
his
authority
would
have
done
that
during
my
stay
at
tripolizza
horses
were
at
my
command
and
guards
who
would
accompany
me
to
any
part
of
the
country
i
might
choose
to
visit
next
morning
he
sent
a
complimentary
message
importing
that
he
had
ordered
dinner
to
be
prepared
at
the
doctor
for
me
and
two
of
his
officers
the
two
officers
were
lively
fellows
one
of
them
in
particular
seemed
to
have
acquired
by
instinct
a
large
share
of
the
ease
and
politeness
of
christendom
the
dinner
surpassed
all
count
and
reckoning
dish
followed

till
i
began
to
fancy
that
the
cook
either
expected
i
would
honour
his
highness
entertainment
as
caesar
did
the
supper
of
cicero
or
supposed
that
the
party
were
not
finite
beings
during
the
course
of
this
amazing
service
the
principal
singers
and
musicians
of
the
seraglio
arrived
and
sung
and
played
several
pieces
of
very
sweet
turkish
music
among
others
was
a
song
composed
by
the
late
unfortunate
sultan
selim
the
air
of
which
was
pleasingly
simple
and
pathetic
i
had
heard
of
the
sultan
poetry
before
a
small
collection
of
which
has
been
printed
it
is
said
to
be
interesting
and
tender
consisting
chiefly
of
little
sonnets
written
after
he
was
deposed
in
which
he
contrasts
the
tranquillity
of
his
retirement
with
the
perils
and
anxieties
of
his
former
grandeur
after
the
songs
the
servants
of
the
officers
who
were
albanians
danced
a
macedonian
reel
in
which
they
exhibited
several
furious
specimens
of
highland
agility
the
officers
then
took
their
leave
and
i
went
to
bed
equally
gratified
by
the
hospitality
of

the

on

sketch
of
the
career
of
ali
and
the
perseverance
with
which
he
pursued
the
objects
of
his
ambition
although
many
traits
and
lineaments
of
lord
byron
own
character
may
be
traced
in
the
portraits
of
his
heroes
i
have
yet
often
thought
that
ali
pasha
was
the
model
from
which
he
drew
several
of
their
most
remarkable
features
and
on
this
account
it
may
be
expedient
to
give
a
sketch
of
that
bold
and
stern
personage
if
i
am
correct
in
my
conjecture
and
the
reader
can
judge
for
himself
when
the
picture
is
before
him
it
would
be
a
great
defect
according
to
the
plan
of
this
work
not
to
do
so
ali
pasha
was
born
at
tepellene
about
the
year
his
father
was
a
pasha
of
two
tails
but
possessed
of
little
influence
at
his
death
ali
succeeded
to
no
inheritance
but
the
house
in
which
he
was
born
and
it
was
his
boast
in
the
plenitude
of
his
power
that
he
began
his
fortune
with
sixty
paras
about
eighteen
pence
sterling
and
a
musket
at
that
time
the
country
was
much
infested
with
and
the
flocks
and
herds
of
the
neighbouring
villages
were
often
plundered
ali
collected
a
few
followers
from
among
the
retainers
of
his
father
made
himself
master
first
of
one
village
then
of
another
amassed
money
increased
his
power
and
at
last
found
himself
at
the
head
of
a
considerable
body
of
albanians
whom
he
paid
by
plunder
for
he
was
then
only
a
great
robber
the
rob
roy
of
albania
in
a
word
one
of
those
independent
freebooters
who
divide
among
themselves
so
much
of
the
riches
and
revenues
of
the
ottoman
dominions
in
following
up
this
career
he
met
with
many
adventures
and
reverses
but
his
course
was
still
onwards
and
uniformly
distinguished
by
enterprise
and
cruelty
his
enemies
expected
no
mercy
when
vanquished
in
the
field
and
when
accidentally
seized
in
private
they
were
treated
with
equal
rigour
it
is
reported
that
he
even
roasted
alive
on
spits
some
of
his
most
distinguished
adversaries
when
he
had
collected
money
enough
he
bought
a
pashalic
and
being
invested
with
that
dignity
he
became
still
more
eager
to
enlarge
his
possessions
he
continued
in
constant
war
with
the
neighbouring
pashas
and
cultivating
by
adroit
agents
the
most
influential
interest
at
constantinople
he
finally
obtained
possession
of
joannina
and
was
confirmed
pasha
of
the
territory
attached
to
it
by
an
imperial
firman
he
then
went
to
war
with
the
pashas
of
arta
of
delvino
and
of
ocrida
whom
he
subdued
together
with
that
of
triccala
and
established
a
predominant
influence
over
the
agas
of
thessaly
the
pasha
of
vallona
he
poisoned
in
a
bath
at
sophia
and
strengthened
his
power
by
marrying
his
two
sons
mouctar
and
velhi
to
the
daughters
of
the
successor
and
brother
of
the
man
whom
he

the
bowl
a

attendant

he
drank
one
draught
nor
needed
more
during
this
progression
of
his
fortunes
he
had
been
more
than
once
called
upon
to
furnish
his
quota
of
troops
to
the
imperial
armies
and
had
served
at
their
head
with
distinction
against
the
russians
he
knew
his
countrymen
however
too
well
ever
to
trust
himself
at
constantinople
it
was
reported
that
he
had
frequently
been
offered
some
of
the
highest
offices
in
the
empire
but
he
always
declined
them
and
sought
for
power
only
among
the
fastnesses
of
his
native
region
stories
of
the
skill
and
courage
with
which
he
counteracted
several
machinations
to
procure
his
head
were
current
and
popular
throughout
the
country
and
among
the
greeks
in
general
he
was
certainly
regarded
as
inferior
only
to
the
grand
vizier
himself
but
though
distrusting
and
distrusted
he
always
in
the
field
fought
for
the
sultan
with
great
bravery
particularly
against
the
famous
rebel
paswan
oglou
on
his
return
from
that
war
in
he
was
in
consequence
made
a
pasha
of
three
tails
or
vizier
and
was
more
than
once
offered
the
ultimate
dignity
of
grand
vizier
but
he
still
declined
all
the
honours
of
the
metropolis
the
object
of
his
ambition
was
not
temporary
power
but
to
found
a
kingdom
he
procured
however
pashalics
for
his
two
sons
the
younger
of
whom
velhi
saved
sufficient
money
in
his
first
government
to
buy
the
pashalic
of
the
morea
with
the
dignity
of
vizier
for
which
he
paid
thousand
pounds
sterling
his
eldest
son
mouctar
was
of
a
more
warlike
turn
with
less
ambition
than
his
brother
at
the
epoch
of
which
i
am
speaking
he
supplied
his
father
place
at
the
head
of
the
albanians
in
the
armies
of
the
sultan
in
which
he
greatly
distinguished
himself
in
the
campaign
of
against
the
russians
the
difficulties
which
ali
pasha
had
to
encounter
in
establishing
his
ascendancy
did
not
arise
so
much
from
the
opposition
he
met
with
from
the
neighbouring
pashas
as
from
the
nature
of
the
people
and
of
the
country
of
which
he
was
determined
to
make
himself
master
many
of
the
plains
and
valleys
which
composed
his
dominions
were
occupied
by
inhabitants
who
had
been
always
in
rebellion
and
were
never
entirely
conquered
by
the
turks
such
as
the
chimeriotes
the
sulliotes
and
the
nations
living
among
the
mountains
adjacent
to
the
coast
of
the
ionian
sea
besides
this
the
woods
and
hills
of
every
part
of
his
dominions
were
in
a
great
degree
possessed
by
formidable
bands
of
robbers
who
recruited
and
protected
by
the
villages
and
commanded
by
chiefs
as
brave
and
as
enterprising
as
himself
laid
extensive
tracts
under
contribution
burning
and
plundering
regardless
of
his
jurisdiction
against
these
he
proceeded
with
the
most
iron
severity
they
were
burned
hanged
beheaded
and
impaled
in
all
parts
of
the
country
until
they
were
either
exterminated
or
expelled
a
short
time
before
the
arrival
of
lord
byron
at
joannina
a
large
body
of
insurgents
who
infested
the
mountains
between
that
city
and
triccala
were
defeated
and
dispersed
by
mouctar
pasha
who
cut
to
pieces
a
hundred
of
them
on
the
spot
these
robbers
had
been
headed
by
a
greek
priest
who
after
the
defeat
went
to
constantinople
and
procured
a
firman
of
protection
with
which
he
ventured
to
return
to
joannina
where
the
vizier
invited
him
to
a
conference
and
made
him
a
prisoner
in
deference
to
the
firman
ali
confined
him
in
prison
but
used
him
well
until
a
messenger
could
bring
from
constantinople
a
permission
from
the
porte
to
authorise
him
to
do
what
he
pleased
with
the
rebel
it
was
the
arm
of
this
man
which
byron
beheld
suspended
from
the
bough
on
entering
joannina
by
these
vigorous
measures
ali
pasha
rendered
the
greater
part
of
albania
and
the
contiguous
districts
safely
accessible
which
were
before
overrun
by
bandits
and
freebooters
and
consequently
by
opening
the
country
to
merchants
and
securing
their
persons
and
goods
not
only
increased
his
own
revenues
but
improved
the
condition
of
his
subjects
he
built
bridges
over
the
rivers
raised
causeways
over
the
marshes
opened
roads
adorned
the
country
and
the
towns
with
new
buildings
and
by
many
salutary
regulations
acted
the
part
of
a
just
though
a
merciless
prince
in
private
life
he
was
no
less
distinguished
for
the
same
unmitigated
cruelty
but
he
afforded
many
examples
of
strong
affection
the
wife
of
his
son
mouctar
was
a
great
favourite
with
the
old
man
upon
paying
her
a
visit
one
morning
he
found
her
in
tears
he
questioned
her
several
times
as
to
the
cause
of
her
grief
she
at
last
reluctantly
acknowledged
that
it
arose
from
the
diminution
of
her
husband
regard
he
inquired
if
she
thought
he
paid
attention
to
other
women
the
reply
was
in
the
affirmative
and
she
related
that
a
lady
of
the
name
of
phrosyne
the
wife
of
a
rich
jew
had
beguiled
her
of
her
husband
love
for
she
had
seen
at
the
bath
upon
the
finger
of
phrosyne
a
rich
ring
which
had
belonged
to
mouctar
and
which
she
had
often
in
vain
entreated
him
to
give
to
her
ali
immediately
ordered
the
lady
to
be
seized
and
to
be
tied
up
in
a
sack
and
cast
into
the
lake
various
versions
of
this
tragical
tale
are
met
with
in
all
parts
of
the
country
and
the
fate
of
phrosyne
is
embodied
in
a
ballad
of
touching
pathos
and
melody
that
the
character
of
this
intrepid
and
ruthless
warrior
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
mind
of
byron
can
not
be
questioned
the
scenes
in
which
he
acted
were
as
the
poet
traversed
the
country
everywhere
around
him
and
his
achievements
bloody
dark
and
brave
had
become
themes
of
song

the

as

as
my

goes

can

favourably
i
was

by
two
an
infidel
and
a
mussulman
to

of

which
came

the
former
a

of

and
the

about
my
own
basili
was
strictly
charged
by

in

to
attend

and
dervish
was
one
of
fifty
who
accompanied
us
through
the
forests
of
acarnania
to
the
banks
of
the
achelous
and
onward
to
missolonghi
there
i
took
him
into
my
own
service
and
never
had
occasion
to
repent
it
until
the
moment
of
my
departure
when
in
after
my
friend
mr
hobhouse
left
me
for
england
i
was
seized
with
a
severe
fever
in
the
morea
these
men
saved
my
life
by
frightening
away
my
physician
whose
throat
they
threatened
to
cut
if
i
was
not
cured
within
a

consolatory
assurance
of

refusal
of

i
had
left
my

my

was
as
ill
as
myself
and
my
poor
arnaouts
nursed
me
with
an
attention
which
would
have
done
honour
to
civilization
they
had
a
variety
of
adventures
for
the
moslem
dervish
being
a
remarkably
handsome
man
was
always
squabbling
with
the
husbands
of
athens
insomuch
that
four
of
the
principal
turks
paid
me
a
visit
of
remonstrance
at
the
convent
on
the
subject
of
his
having
taken
a
woman
to
the
bath
whom
he
had
lawfully
bought
however
a
thing
quite
contrary
to
etiquette
basili
also
was
extremely
gallant
among
his
own
persuasion
and
had
the
greatest
veneration
for
the
church
mixed
with
the
highest
contempt
of
churchmen
whom
he
cuffed
upon
occasion
in
a
most
heterodox
manner
yet
he
never
passed
a
church
without
crossing
himself
and
i
remember
the
risk
he
ran
on
entering
st
sophia
in
stamboul
because
it
had
once
been
a
place
of
his
worship
on
remonstrating
with
him
on
his
inconsistent
proceedings
he
invariably
answered
church
is
holy
our
priests
are
thieves
and
then
he
crossed
himself
as
usual
and
boxed
the
ears
of
the
first
papas
who
refused
to
assist
in
any
required
operation
as
was
always
found
to
be
necessary
where
a
priest
had
any
influence
with
the
cogia
bashi
of
his
village
indeed
a
more
abandoned
race
of
miscreants
can
not
exist
than
the
lower
orders
of
the
greek
clergy
when
preparations
were
made
for
my
return
my
albanians
were
summoned
to
receive
their
pay
basili
took
his
with
an
awkward
show
of
regret
at
my
intended
departure
and
marched
away
to
his
quarters
with
his
bag
of
piastres
i
sent
for
dervish
but
for
some
time
he
was
not
to
be
found
at
last
he
entered
just
as
signor
logotheti
father
to
the
of
athens
and
some
other
of
my
greek
acquaintances
paid
me
a
visit
dervish
took
the
money
but
on
a
sudden
dashed
it
on
the
ground
and
clasping
his
hands
which
he
raised
to
his
forehead
rushed
out
of
the
room
weeping
bitterly
from
that
moment
to
the
hour
of
my
embarkation
he
continued
his
lamentations
and
all
our
efforts
to
console
him
only
produced
this
answer
leaves
me
signor
logotheti
who
never
wept
before
for
anything
less
than
the
loss
of
a
paras
melted
the
padre
of
the
convent
my
attendants
my
visitors
and
i
verily
believe
that
even
sterne
foolish
fat
scullion
would
have
left
her
to
sympathise
with
the
unaffected
and
unexpected
sorrow
of
this
barbarian
for
my
part
when
i
remembered
that
a
short
time
before
my
departure
from
england
a
noble
and
most
intimate
associate
had
excused
himself
from
taking
leave
of
me
because
he
had
to
attend
a
relation
a
milliner
i
felt
no
less
surprised
than
humiliated
by
the
present
occurrence
and
the
past
recollection
the
albanians
in
general
i
do
not
mean
the
cultivators
of
the
earth
in
the
provinces
who
have
also
that
appellation
but
the
mountaineers
have
a
fine
cast
of
countenance
and
the
most
beautiful
women
i
have
ever
beheld
in
stature
and
in
features
we
saw
levelling
the
road
broken
down
by
the
torrents
between
delvinaki
and
libokavo
their
manner
of
walking
is
truly
theatrical
but
this
strut
is
probably
the
effect
of
the
capote
or
cloak
depending
from
one
shoulder
their
long
hair
reminds
you
of
the
spartans
and
their
courage
in
desultory
warfare
is
unquestionable
though
they
have
some
cavalry
among
the
gedges
i
never
saw
a
good
arnaout
horseman
but
on
foot
they
are
never
to
be
subdued
the
travellers
having
left
volondorako
proceeded
southward
until
they
came
near
to
the
seaside
and
passing
along
the
shore
under
a
castle
belonging
to
ali
pasha
on
the
lofty
summit
of
a
steep
rock
they
at
last
reached
nicopolis
again
the
ruins
of
which
they
revisited
on
their
arrival
at
prevesa
they
had
no
choice
left
but
that
of
crossing
carnia
and
the
country
being
as
already
mentioned
overrun
with
robbers
they
provided
themselves
with
a
guard
of
soldiers
and
procured
another
galliot
to
take
them
down
the
gulf
of
arta
to
the
place
whence
they
were
to
commence
their
land
journey
having
embarked
they
continued
sailing
with
very
little
wind
until
they
reached
the
fortress
of
vonitza
where
they
waited
all
night
for
the
freshening
of
the
morning
breeze
with
which
they
again
set
sail
and
about
four
in
the
afternoon
arrived
at
utraikee
at
this
place
there
was
only
a
custom
house
and
a
barrack
for
troops
close
to
each
other
and
surrounded
except
towards
the
water
by
a
high
wall
in
the
evening
the
gates
were
secured
and
preparations
made
for
feeding
their
albanian
guards
a
goat
was
killed
and
roasted
whole
and
four
fires
were
kindled
in
the
yard
around
which
the
soldiers
seated
themselves
in
parties
after
eating
and
drinking
the
greater
part
of
them
assembled
at
the
largest
of
the
fires
and
while
the
travellers
were
themselves
with
the
elders
of
the
party
seated
on
the
ground
danced
round
the
blaze
to
their
own
songs
with
astonishing
highland
energy
childe
harold
at
a
little
distance
stood
and

but
not
displeased
the
revelry
nor
hated
harmless
mirth
however
rude
in
sooth
it
was
no
vulgar
sight
to
see
their
barbarous
yet
their
not
indecent
glee
and
as
the
flames
along
their
faces
gleam
their
gestures
nimble
dark
eyes
flashing
free
the
long
wild
locks

byron
and
his

continued

southward
the
reports
of
the
state
of

country
induced

to
take
ten
additional
soldiers
with
them
as
their
road
for
the
first
two
hours
lay
through
dangerous
passes
in
the
forest
on
approaching
these
places
fifteen
or
twenty
of
the
party
walked
briskly
on
before
and
when
they
had
gone
through
the
pass
halted
until
the
travellers
came
up
in
the
woods
two
or
three
green
spots
were
discovered
on
the
and
on
them
turkish
tombstones
generally
under
a
clump
of
trees
and
near
a
well
or
fountain
when
they
had
passed
the
forest
they
reached
an
open
country
whence
they
sent
back
the
ten
men
whom
they
had
brought
from
utraikee
they
then
passed
on
to
a
village
called
catoona
where
they
arrived
by
noon
it
was
their
intention
to
have
proceeded
farther
that
day
but
their
progress
was
interrupted
by
an
affair
between
their
albanian
guard
and
the
primate
of
the
village
as
they
were
looking
about
while
horses
were
collecting
to
carry
their
luggage
one
of
the
soldiers
drew
his
sword
at
the
primate
the
greek
head
magistrate
guns
were
cocked
and
in
an
instant
before
either
lord
byron
or
mr
hobhouse
could
stop
the
affray
the
primate
throwing
off
his
shoes
and
cloak
fled
so
precipitately
that
he
rolled
down
the
hill
and
dislocated
his
shoulder
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
could
persuade
him
to
return
to
his
house
where
they
lodged
and
when
he
did
return
he
remarked
that
he
cared
comparatively
little
about
his
shoulder
to
the
loss
of
a
purse
with
fifteen
sequins
which
had
dropped
out
of
his
pocket
during
the
tumble
the
hint
was
understood
catoona
is
inhabited
by
greeks
only
and
is
a
rural
village
the
primate
house
was
neatly
fitted
up
with
sofas
upon
a
knoll
in
the
middle
of
the
village
stood
a
schoolhouse
and
from
that
spot
the
view
was
very
extensive
to
the
west
are
lofty
mountains
ranging
from
north
to
south
near
the
coast
to
the
east
a
grand
romantic
prospect
in
the
distance
and
in
the
foreground
a
green
valley
with
a
considerable
river
winding
through
a
long
line
of
country
they
had
some
difficulty
in
procuring
horses
at
catoona
and
in
consequence
were
detained
until
past
eleven
the
next
morning
and
only
travelled
four
hours
that
day
to
makala
a
stone
village
containing
about
forty
houses
distinct
from
each
other
and
inhabited
by
greeks
who
were
a
little
above
the
condition
of
peasants
being
engaged
in
pasturage
and
a
small
the
travellers
were
now
in
carnia
where
they
found
the
inhabitants
much
better
lodged
than
in
the
albanian
villages
the
house
in
which
they
slept
at
this
place
resembled
those
old
mansions
which
are
to
be
met
with
in
the
bottoms
of
the
wiltshire
downs
two
green
courts
one
before
and
the
other
behind
were
attached
to
it
and
the
whole
was
surrounded
by
a
high
and
thick
wall
which
shut
out
the
prospect
but
was
necessary
in
a
country
so
frequently
overrun
by
strong
bands
of
freebooters
from
makala
they
proceeded
through
the
woods
and
in
the
course
of
their
journey
passed
three
graves
which
the
albanians
pointing
at
as
they
rode
by
said
they
were
robbers
in
the
course
of
the
journey
they
had
a
distant
view
of
the
large
town
of
vraikore
on
the
left
bank
of
the
aspro
but
they
did
not
approach
it
crossing
the
river
by
a
ferry
to
the
village
of
gouria
where
they
passed
the
night
leaving
that
place
in
the
morning
they
took
an
easterly
direction
and
continued
to
ride
across
a
plain
of
cornfields
near
the
banks
of
the
river
in
a
rich
country
sometimes
over
stone
causeways
and
between
the
hedges
of
gardens
and
until
they
were
stopped
by
the
sea
this
was
that
fruitful
region
formerly
called
paracheloitis
which
according
to
classic
allegory
was
drained
or
torn
from
the
river
achelous
by
the
perseverance
of
hercules
and
presented
by
him
for
a
nuptial
present
to
the
daughter
of
oeneus
the
water
at
which
they
had
now
arrived
was
rather
a
salt
marsh
than
the
sea
a
shallow
bay
stretching
from
the
mouth
of
the
gulf
of
lepanto
into
the
land
for
several
miles
having
dismissed
their
horses
they
passed
over
in
boats
to
natolico
a
town
which
stood
in
the
water
here
they
fell
in
with
a
hospitable
jew
who
made
himself
remembered
by
saying
that
he
was
honoured
in
their
having
partaken
of
his
little
misery
natolico
where
they
stayed
for
the
night
was
a
town
the
houses
of
timber
chiefly
of
two
stories
and
about
six
hundred
in
number
having
sent
on
their
baggage
in
boats
they
themselves
proceeded
to
the
town
of
missolonghi
so
celebrated
since
as
having
suffered
greatly
during
the
recent
rebellion
of
the
greeks
but
more
particularly
as
the
place
where
lord
byron
died
missolonghi
is
situated
on
the
south
side
of
the
salt
marsh
or
shallow
along
the
north
coast
of
the
gulf
of
corinth
nearly
opposite
to
patras
it
is
a
dull
and
i
should
think
an
unwholesome
place
the
marsh
for
miles
on
each
side
has
only
from
a
foot
to
two
feet
of
water
on
it
but
there
is
a
channel
for
boats
marked
out
by
perches
when
i
was
there
the
weather
was
extremely
wet
and
i
had
no
other
opportunity
of
seeing
the
character
of
the
adjacent
country
than
during
the
intervals
of
the
showers
it
was
green
and
pastoral
with
a
short
skirt
of
cultivation
along
the
bottom
of
the
hills
abrupt
and
rapid
as
the
foregoing
sketch
of
the
journey
through
albania
has
been
it
is
evident
from
the
novelty
of
its
circumstances
that
it
could
not
be
performed
without
leaving
deep
impressions
on
the
susceptible
mind
of
the
poet
it
is
impossible
i
think
not
to
allow
that
far
more
of
the
wildness
and
romantic
gloom
of
his
imagination
was
derived
from
the
incidents
of
this
tour
than
from
all
the
previous
experience
of
his
life
the
scenes
he
visited
the
characters
with
whom
he
became
familiar
and
above
all
the
chartered
feelings
passions
and
principles
of
the
inhabitants
were
greatly
calculated
to
supply
his
mind
with
rare
and
valuable
poetical
materials
it
is
only
in
this
respect
that
the
details
of
his
travels
are
considered
as
constituting
a
portion
of
the
education
of
his
genius
they
are
highly
curious
and
serve
to
show
how
little
after
all
of
great
invention
is
requisite
to
make
interesting
and
magnificent
poetry
from
missolonghi
the
travellers
passed
over
the
gulf
of
corinth
to
patras
then
a
rude
open
town
with
a
fortress
on
the
top
of
a
hill
and
on
the
of
december
in
the
afternoon
they
proceeded
towards
corinth
but
halted
at
vostizza
the
ancient
aegium
where
they
obtained
their
first
view
of
parnassus
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
gulf
rising
high
above
the
other
peaks
of
that
hilly
region
and
capped
with
snow
it
probably
was
during
this
first
visit
to
vostizza
that
the
address
to
parnassus
was
suggested
oh
thou
parnassus
whom
i
now
survey
not
in
the
frensy
of
a
dreamer
eye
not
in
the
fabled
landscape
of
a
lay
but
soaring
through
thy
native
sky
in
the
wild
pomp
of
mountain
majesty
what
marvel
if
i
thus
essay
to
sing
the
humblest
of
thy
pilgrims
passing
by
would
gladly
woo
thine
echoes
with
his
string
though
from
thy
heights
no
more
one
muse
will
wave
her
wing
oft
have
i
dream
of
thee
whose
glorious
name
who
knows
not
knows
not
man
divinest
lore
and
now
i
view
thee
is
alas
with
shame
that
i
in
feeblest
accents
must
adore
when
i
recount
thy
worshippers
of
yore
i
tremble
and
can
only
bend
the
knee
nor
raise
my
voice
nor
vainly
dare
to
soar
but
gaze
beneath
thy
cloudy
canopy
in
silent
joy
to
think
at
last
i
look
on
thee

rang
with

yet
it
is
already
probable
that

to
posterity
as
an
incident
in
the
life
of
one
of

certainly
no

mournful

of

seem
as
requisite
for
the
preservation
of

morals
as
the

themselves
at

it
is
the
melancholy
moral
of
history
that
when
nations
resolve
to
be
peaceful
with
respect
to
their
neighbours
they
begin
to
be
vicious
with
respect
to
themselves

to

to
the

on
the

they
hired
a

with
fourteen
men
and
ten
oars
and
sailed
to
salona
thence
they
proceeded
to

rode
on

mountain
on

by
a
steep
craggy
path
towards
the
after
scaling
the
side

for
about
an
hour
they
saw
vast
masses
of

and
fragments
of

piled
in
a
perilous
manner
above
them
with
niches
and
sepulchres
and
relics

on

they
visited

still
like

in

part
with

from

the
travellers
proceeded
towards
livadia
passing
in
the
course
of
the
journey
the
confluence
of
the
three
roads
where
oedipus
slew
his
father
an
event
with
its
hideous
train
of
fatalities
which
could
not
be
recollected
by
byron
on
the
spot
even
after
the
tales
of
guilt
he
had
gathered
in
his
albanian
journeys
without
agitating
associations
at
livadia
they
remained
the
greater
part
of
three
days
during
which
they
examined
with
more
than
ordinary
minuteness
the
cave
of
trophonius
and
the
streams
of
the
hercyna
composed
of
the
mingled
waters
of
the
two
fountains
of
oblivion
and
memory
from
livadia
after
visiting
the
battlefield
of
chaeronea
the
birthplace
of
plutarch
and
also
many
of
the
almost
innumerable
storied
and
consecrated
spots
in
the
neighbourhood
the
travellers
proceeded
to
thebes
a
poor
town
containing
about
five
hundred
wooden
houses
with
two
shabby
mosques
and
four
humble
churches
the
only
thing
worthy
of
notice
in
it
is
a
public
clock
to
which
the
inhabitants
direct
the
attention
of
strangers
as
proudly
as
if
it
were
indeed
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
there
they
still
affect
to
show
the
fountain
of
dirce
and
the
ruins
of
the
house
of
pindar
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
describe
the
numberless
relics
of
the
famous
things
of
greece
which
every
hour
as
they
approached
towards
athens
lay
more
and
more
in
their
way
not
that
many
remarkable
objects
met
their
view
yet
fragments
of
antiquity
were
often
seen
though
many
of
them
were
probably
brought
far
from
the
edifices
to
which
they
had
originally
belonged
not
for
their
beauty
or
on
account
of
the
veneration
which
the
sight
of
them
inspired
but
because
they
would
burn
into
better
lime
than
the
coarser
rock
of
the
lulls
nevertheless
abased
and
returned
into
rudeness
as
all
things
were
the
presence
of

was
felt

not

this

opened
they
beheld
the

of
the
ancient
walls
of
phyle
a
fortress
which
commanded
one
of
the
passes
from

famous
as
the
retreat
of
the

while
i
am
inclined
to
think
it
was
so
as
i
recollect
he
told
me
there
that
he
had
then
described
or
was
describing
the
reception
he
had
met
with
at
tepellene
from
ali
pasha
after
having
halted
some
time
at
athens
where
they
established
their
headquarters
the
travellers
when
they
had
inspected
the
principal
antiquities
of
the
city
those
things
which
all
travellers
must
visit
made
several
excursions
into
the
environs
and
among
other
places
went
to
eleusis
on
the
of
january
they
mounted
earlier
than
usual
and
set
out
on
that
road
which
has
the
site
of
the
academy
and
the
colonos
the
retreat
of
oedipus
during
his
banishment
a
little
to
the
right
they
then
entered
the
olive
groves
crossed
the
cephessus
and
came
to
an
open
plain
extending
on
the
left
to
the
piraeus
and
the
sea
having
ascended
by
a
gentle
acclivity
through
a
pass
at
the
distance
of
eight
or
ten
miles
from
athens
the
ancient
corydallus
now
called
daphnerouni
they
came
at
the
bottom
of
a
piney
mountain
to
the
little
monastery
of
daphne
the
appearance
and
situation
of
which
are
in
agreeable
unison
the
monastery
was
then
fast
verging
into
that
state
of
the
uninhabitable
picturesque
so
much
admired
by
young
damsels
and
artists
of
a
romantic
vein
the
pines
on
the
adjacent
mountains
hiss
as
they
ever
wave
their
boughs
and
somehow
such
is
the
lonely
aspect
of
the
place
that
their
hissing
may
be
imagined
to
breathe
satire
against
the
pretensions
of
human
vanity
after
passing
through
the
hollow
valley
in
which
this
monastic
habitation
is
situated
the
road
sharply
turns
round
an
elbow
of
the
mountain
and
the
eleusinian
plain
opens
immediately
in
front
it
is
however
for
a
plain
but
of
small
dimensions
on
the
left
is
the
island
of
salamis
and
the
straits
where
the
battle
was
fought
but
neither
of
it
nor
of
the
mysteries
for
which
the
temple
of
ceres
was
for
so
many
ages
celebrated
has
the
poet
given
us
description
or
suggestion
and
yet
few
topics
among
all
his
wild
and
wonderful
subjects
were
so
likely
to
have
furnished
such
ample
room
and

of

kind

be
applied
to

in
attica
was
to
cape
colonna
crossing
the
bed
of
the
ilissus
and
keeping
nearer
to
mount
hymettus
the
travellers
arrived
at
vary
a
farm
belonging
to
the
monastery
of
agios
asomatos
and
under
the
charge
of
a
caloyer
here
they
stopped
for
the
night
and
being
furnished
with
lights
and
attended
by
the
caloyer
servant
as
a
guide
they
proceeded
to
inspect
the
paneum
or
sculptured
cavern
in
that
neighbourhood
into
which
they
descended
having
satisfied
their
curiosity
there
they
proceeded
in
the
morning
to
keratea
a
small
town
containing
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
houses
chiefly
inhabited
by
rural
albanians
the
wetness
of
the
weather
obliged
them
to
remain
several
days
at
keratea
during
which
they
took
the
opportunity
of
a
few
hours
of
sunshine
to
ascend
the
mountain
of
parne
in
quest
of
a
cave
of
which
many
wonderful
things
were
reported
in
the
country
having
found
the
entrance
kindled
their
pine
torches
and
taken
a
supply
of
strips
of
the
same
wood
they
let
themselves
down
through
a
narrow
aperture
creeping
still
farther
down
they
came
into
what
seemed
a
large
subterranean
hall
arched
as
it
were
with
high
cupolas
of
crystal
and
divided
into
long
aisles
by
columns
of
glittering
spar
in
some
parts
spread
into
wide
horizontal
chambers
in
others
terminated
by
the
dark
mouths
of
deep
and
steep
abysses
receding
into
the
interior
of
the
mountain
the
travellers
wandered
from
one
grotto
to
another
until
they
came
to
a
fountain
of
pure
water
by
the
side
of
which
they
lingered
some
time
till
observing
that
their
torches
were
wasting
they
resolved
to
return
but
after
exploring
the
labyrinth
for
a
few
minutes
they
found
themselves
again
close
beside
this
mysterious
spring
it
was
not
without
reason
they
then
became
alarmed
for
the
guide
confessed
with
trepidation
that
he
had
forgotten
the
intricacies
of
the
cave
and
knew
not
how
to
recover
the
outlet
byron
often
described
this
adventure
with
spirit
and
humour
magnifying
both
his
own
and
his
friend
terrors
and
though
of
course
there
was
caricature
in
both
yet
the
distinction
was
characteristic
mr
hobhouse
being
of
a
more
solid
disposition
naturally
could
discern
nothing
but
a
grave
cause
for
dread
in
being
thus
lost
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
byron
however
described
his
own
anxiety
as
a
species
of
excitement
and
titillation
which
moved
him
to
laughter
their
escape
from
starvation
and
being
buried
alive
was
truly
providential
while
roaming
in
a
state
of
despair
from
cave
to
cell
climbing
up
narrow
apertures
their
last
fast
consuming
totally
ignorant
of
their
position
and
all
around
darkness
they
discovered
as
it
were
by
accident
a
ray
of
light
gleaming
towards
them
they
hastened
towards
it
and
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
although
the
poet
has
not
made
any
use
of
this
incident
in
description
the
actual
experience
which
it
gave
him
of
what
despair
is
could
not
but
enrich
his
metaphysical
store
and
increase
his
knowledge
of
terrible
feelings
of
the
workings
of
the
darkest
and
dreadest
anticipations
slow
famishing
death
cannibalism
and

amid
them
that
falconer
laid
the
scene
of
his
shipwreck
and
the
unequalled
description
of
the
climate
of
greece
in
the
giaour
was
probably
inspired
there
although
the
poem
was
written
in
london
it
was
also
here
but
not
on
this
occasion
that
the
poet
first
became
acquainted
with
the
albanian
belief
in
to
which
he
alludes
in
the
same
poem
deep
in
whose
ear
the
peal
of
murder
near
this
superstition
of
a
says
lord
byron
fell
once
under
my
own
observation
on
my
third
journey
to
cape
colonna
as
we
passed
through
the
defile
that
leads
from
the
hamlet
between
keratea
and
colonna
i
observed
dervish
tahiri
one
of
his
albanian
servants
riding
rather
out
of
the
path
and
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
as
if
in
pain
i
rode
up
and
inquired
are
in
peril
he
answered
peril
we
are
not
now
in
albania
nor
in
the
passes
to
ephesus
missolonghi
or
lepanto
there
are
plenty
of
us
well
armed
and
the
choriotes
have
not
courage
to
be
thieves
affendi
but
nevertheless
the
shot
is
ringing
in
my
ears
shot
not
a
tophaike
has
been
fired
this
morning
hear
it
notwithstanding
bom
bom
as
plainly
as
i
hear
your
you
please
affendi
if
it
is
written
so
will
it
be
i
left
this
predestinarian
and
rode
up
to
basili
his
christian
compatriot
whose
ears
though
not
at
all
prophetic
by
no
means
relished
the
intelligence
we
all
arrived
at
colonna
remained
some
hours
and
returned
leisurely
saying
a
variety
of
brilliant
things
in
more
languages
than
spoiled
the
building
of
babel
upon
the
mistaken
seer
romaic
arnaout
turkish
italian
and
english
were
all
exercised
in
various
conceits
upon
the
unfortunate
mussulman
while
we
were
contemplating
the
beautiful
prospect
dervish
was
occupied
about
the
columns
i
thought
he
was
deranged
into
an
antiquarian
and
asked
him
if
he
had
become
a
palaocastro
man
said
he
these
pillars
will
be
useful
in
making
a
stand
and
added
some
remarks
which
at
least
evinced
his
own
belief
in
his
troublesome
faculty
of
on
our
return
to
athens
we
heard
from
leone
a
prisoner
set
on
shore
some
days
after
of
the
intended
attack
of
the
mainotes
with
the
cause
of
its
not
taking
place
i
was
at
some
pains
to
question
the
man
and
he
described
the
dresses
arms
and
marks
of
the
horses
of
our
party
so
accurately
that
with
other
circumstances
we
could
not
doubt
of
his
having
been
in
company
and
ourselves
in
a
bad
neighbourhood
dervish
became
a
soothsayer
for
life
and
i
dare
say
is
now
hearing
more
musketry
than
ever
will
be
fired
to
the
great
refreshment
of
the
arnaouts
of
berat
and
his
native
mountains
in
all
attica
if
we
except
athens
itself
and
marathon
byron
remarks
there
is
no
scene
more
interesting
than
cape
colonna
to
the
antiquary
and
artist
sixteen
columns
are
an
inexhaustible
source
of
observation
and
design
to
the
philosopher
the
supposed
scene
of
some
of
plato
conversations
will
not
be
unwelcome
and
the
traveller
will
be
struck
with
the
prospect
over
that
crown
the
aegean
deep
but
for
an
englishman
colonna
has
yet
an
additional
interest
in
being
the
actual
spot
of
falconer
shipwreck
pallas
and
plato
are
forgotten
in
the
recollection
of
falconer
and
campbell
there
in
the
dead
of
night
by
donna
steep
the
seamen
cry
was
heard
along
the
deep
from
the
ruins
of
the
temple
the
travellers
returned
to
keratea
by
the
eastern
coast
of
attica
passing
through
that
district
of
country
where
the
silver
mines
are
situated
which
according
to
sir
george
wheler
were
worked
with
some
success
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
they
then
set
out
for
marathon
taking
rapthi
in
their
way
where
in
the
lesser
port
on
a
steep
rocky
island
they
beheld
from
a
distance
the
remains
of
a
colossal
statue
they
did
not
however
actually
inspect
it
but
it
has
been
visited
by
other
travellers
who
have
described
it
to
be
of
white
marble
sedent
on
a
pedestal
the
head
and
arms
are
broken
off
but
when
entire
it
is
conjectured
to
have
been
twelve
feet
in
height
as
they
were
passing
round
the
shore
they
heard
the
barking
of
dogs
and
a
shout
from
a
shepherd
and
on
looking
round
saw
a
large
wolf
galloping
slowly
through
the
bushes
such
incidents
and
circumstances
in
the
midst
of
the
most
romantic
scenery
of
the
world
with
wild
and
lawless
companions
and
a
constant
sense
of
danger
were
full
of
poetry
and
undoubtedly
contributed
to
the
formation
of
the
peculiar
taste
of
byron
genius
as
it
has
been
said
of
salvator
rosa
the
painter
that
he
derived
the
characteristic
savage
force
of
his
pencil
from
his
youthful
adventures
with
banditti
it
may
be
added
of
byron
that
much
of
his
most
distinguished
power
was
the
result
of
his
adventures
as
a
traveller
in
greece
his
mind
and
memory
were
filled
with
stores
of
the
fittest
imagery
to
supply
becoming
backgrounds
and
appendages
to
the
characters
and
enterprises
which
he
afterward
depicted
with
such
truth
of
nature
and
poetical
effect
after
leaving
rapthi
keeping
mount
pentilicus
on
the
left
the
travellers
came
in
sight
of
the
plain
of
marathon
the
evening
being
advanced
they
passed
the
barrow
of
the
athenian
slain
unnoticed
but
next
morning
they
examined
minutely
the
field
of
battle
and
fancied
they
had
made
antiquarian
discoveries
in
their
return
to
athens
they
inspected
the
different
objects
of
research
and
fragments
of
antiquity
which
still
attract
travellers
and
with
the
help
of
chandler
and
pausanias
endeavoured
to
determine
the
local
habitation
and
the
name
of
many
things
of
which
the
traditions
have
perished
and
the
forms
have
relapsed
into
rock
soon
after
their
arrival
at
athens
mr
hobhouse
left
lord
byron
to
visit
the
negropont
where
he
was
absent
some
few
days
i
think
he
had
only
been
back
three
or
four
when
i
arrived
from
zante
my
visit
to
athens
at
that
period
was
accidental
i
had
left
malta
with
the
intention
of
proceeding
to
candia
by
specia
and
idra
but
a
dreadful
storm
drove
us
up
the
adriatic
as
far
as
valona
and
in
returning
being
becalmed
off
the
island
of
zante
i
landed
there
and
allowed
the
ship
with
my
luggage
to
proceed
to
her
destination
having
been
advised
to
go
on
by
the
gulf
of
corinth
to
athens
from
which
place
i
was
informed
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
recovering
my
trunks
in
carrying
this
arrangement
into
effect
i
was
induced
to
go
aside
from
the
direct
route
and
to
visit
velhi
pasha
at
tripolizza
to
whom
i
had
letters
returning
by
argos
and
corinth
i
crossed
the
isthmus
and
taking
the
road
by
megara
reached
athens
on
the
of
february
in
the
course
of
this
journey
i
heard
of
two
english
travellers
being
in
the
city
and
on
reaching
the
convent
of
the
propaganda
where
i
had
been
advised
to
take
up
my
lodgings
the
friar
in
charge
of
the
house
informed
me
of
their
names
next
morning
mr
hobhouse
having
heard
of
my
arrival
kindly
called
on
me
and
i
accompanied
him
to
lord
byron
who
then
lodged
with
the
widow
of
a
greek
who
had
been
british
consul
she
was
i
believe
a
respectable
person
with
several
daughters
one
of
whom
has
been
rendered
more
famous
by
his
lordship
verses
than
her
degree
of
beauty
deserved
she
was
a
pale
and
girl
with
regular
grecian
features
whether
he
really
cherished
any
sincere
attachment
to
her
i
much
doubt
i
believe
his
passion
was
equally
innocent
and
poetical
though
he
spoke
of
buying
her
from
her
mother
it
was
to
this
damsel
that
he
addressed

effect
of
their
impression
on
the
genius
of
the
poet
during
his
residence
at
athens
lord
byron
made
almost
daily
excursions
on
horseback
chiefly
for
exercise
and
to
see
the
localities
of
celebrated
spots
he
affected
to
have
no
taste
for
the
arts
and
he
certainly
took
but
little
pleasure
in
the
examination
of
the
ruins
the
marble
quarry
of
mount
pentilicus
from
which
the
materials
for
the
temples
and
principal
edifices
of
athens
are
supposed
to
have
been
brought
was
in
those
days
one
of
the
regular
staple
curiosities
of
greece
this
quarry
is
a
vast
excavation
in
the
side
of
the
hill
a
drapery
of
woodbine
hangs
like
the
festoons
of
a
curtain
over
the
entrance
the
effect
of
which
seen
from
the
outside
is
really
worth
looking
at
but
not
worth
the
trouble
of
riding
three
hours
over
a
road
of
rude
and
rough
fragments
to
see
the
interior
is
like
that
of
any
other
cavern
to
this
place
i
one
day
was
induced
to
accompany
the
two
travellers
we
halted
at
a
monastery
close
by
the
foot
of
the
mountain
where
we
procured
a
guide
and
ate
a
repast
of
olives
and
fried
eggs
dr
chandler
says
that
the
monks
or
caloyers
of
this
convent
are
summoned
to
prayers
by
a
tune
which
is
played
on
a
piece
of
an
iron
hoop
and
on
the
outside
of
the
church
we
certainly
saw
a
piece
of
crooked
iron
suspended
when
struck
it
uttered
a
sound
by
which
the
hour
of
prayer
was
announced
what
sort
of
tune
could
be
played
on
such
an
instrument
the
doctor
has
judiciously
left
his
readers
to
imagine
when
we
reached
the
mouth
of
the
grotto
by
that
very
bad
track
which
the
learned
personage
above
mentioned
clambered
up
we
saw
the
ruins
of
the
building
which
the
doctor
at
first
thought
had
been
possibly
a
hermit
cell
but
which
upon
more
deliberate
reflection
he
became
of
opinion
was
designed
perhaps
for
a
sentinel
to
look
out
and
regulate
by
signals
the
approach
of
the
men
and
teams
employed
in
carrying
marble
to
the
city
this
we
agreed
was
a
very
sagacious
conjecture
it
was
indeed
highly
probable
that
sentinels
were
appointed
to
regulate
by
signals
the
manoeuvres
of
carts
coming
to
fetch
away
stones
having
looked
at
the
outside
of
the
quarry
and
the
guide
having
lighted
candles
we
entered
into
the
interior
and
beheld
on
all
sides
what
dr
chandler
saw
chippings
of
marble
we
then
descended
consecutively
into
a
hole
just
wide
enough
to
let
a
man
pass
and
when
we
had
descended
far
enough
we
found
ourselves
in
a
cell
or
cave
it
might
be
some
ten
or
twelve
feet
square
here
we
stopped
and
like
many
others
who
had
been
there
before
us
attempted
to
engrave
our
names
mine
was
without
success
lord
byron
was
not
much
better
but
mr
hobhouse
was
making
some
progress
to
immortality
when
the
blade
of
his
knife
snapped
or
shutting
suddenly
cut
his
finger
these
attempts
having
failed
we
inscribed
our
initials
on
the
ceiling
with
the
smoke
of
our
candles
after
accomplishing
this
notable
feat
we
got
as
well
out
of
the
scrape
as
we
could
and
returned
to
athens
by
the
village
of
callandris
in
the
evening
after
dinner
as
there
happened
to
be
a
contract
of
marriage
performing
in
the
neighbourhood
we
went
to
see
the
ceremony
between
the
contract
and
espousal
two
years
are
generally
permitted
to
elapse
among
the
greeks
in
the
course
of
which
the
bride
according
to
the
circumstances
of
her
relations
prepares
domestic
chattels
for
her
future
family
the
affections
are
rarely
consulted
on
either
side
for
the
mother
of
the
bridegroom
commonly
arranges
the
match
for
her
son
in
this
case
the
choice
had
been
evidently
made
according
to
the
principle
on
which
mrs
primrose
chose
her
wedding
gown
viz
for
the
qualities
that
would
wear
well
for
the
bride
was
a
stout
household
quean
her
face
painted
with
vermilion
and
her
person
arrayed
in
uncouth
embroidered
garments
unfortunately
we
were
disappointed
of
seeing
the
ceremony
as
it
was
over
before
we
arrived
this
incident
led
me
to
inquire
particularly
into
the
existing
usages
and
customs
of
the
athenians
and
i
find
in
the
notes
of
my
journal
of
the
evening
of
that
day
adventures
a
memorandum
of
a
curious
practice
among
the
athenian
maidens
when
they
become
anxious
to
get
husbands
on
the
first
evening
of
the
new
moon
they
put
a
little
honey
a
little
salt
and
a
piece
of
bread
on
a
plate
which
they
leave
at
a
particular
spot
on
the
east
bank
of
the
ilissus
near
the
stadium
and
muttering
some
ancient
words
to
the
effect
that
fate
may
send
them
a
handsome
young
man
return
home
and
long
for
the
fulfilment
of
the
charm
on
mentioning
this
circumstance
to
the
travellers
one
of
them
informed
me
that
above
the
spot
where
these
offerings
are
made
a
statue
of
venus
according
to
pausanias
formerly
stood
it
is
therefore
highly
probable
that
what
is
now
a
superstitious
was
anciently
a
religious
rite
at
this
period
my
were
full
of
their
adventures
in
albania
the
country
was
new
and
the
inhabitants
had
appeared
to
them
a
bold
and
singular
race
in
addition
to
the
characteristic
descriptions
which
i
have
extracted
from
lord
byron
notes
as
well
as
mr
hobhouse
travels
i
am
indebted
to
them
as
well
as
to
others
for
a
number
of
memoranda
obtained
in
conversation
which
they
have
themselves
neglected
to
record
but
which
probably
became
unconsciously
mingled
with
the
recollections
of
both
at
least
i
can
discern
traces
of
them
in
different
parts
of
the
poet
works
the
albanians
are
a
race
of
mountaineers
and
it
has
been
often
remarked
that
mountaineers
more
than
any
other
people
are
attached
to
their
native
land
while
no
other
have
so
strong
a
thirst
of
adventure
the
affection
which
they
cherish
for
the
scenes
of
their
youth
tends
perhaps
to
excite
their
migratory
spirit
for
the
motive
of
their
adventures
is
to
procure
the
means
of
subsisting
in
ease
at
home
this
migratory
humour
is
not
however
universal
to
the
albanians
but
applies
only
to
those
who
go
in
quest
of
rural
employment
and
who
are
found
in
a
state
of
servitude
among
even
the
greeks
it
deserves
however
to
be
noticed
that
with
the
greeks
they
rarely
ever
mix
or
intermarry
and
that
they
retain
both
their
own
national
dress
and
manners
unchanged
among
them
several
of
their
customs
are
singular
it
is
for
example
in
vain
to
ask
a
light
or
any
fire
from
the
houses
of
the
albanians
after
sunset
if
the
husband
or
head
of
the
family
be
still
afield
a
custom
in
which
there
is
more
of
police
regulation
than
of
superstition
as
it
interdicts
a
plausible
pretext
for
entering
the
cottages
in
the
obscurity
of
twilight
when
the
women
are
defenceless
by
the
absence
of
the
men
some
of
their
usages
with
respect
to
births
baptisms
and
burials
are
also
curious
when
the
mother
feels
the
fulness
of
time
at
hand
the
priestess
of
lucina
the
midwife
is
duly
summoned
and
she
comes
bearing
in
her
hand
a
tripod
better
known
as
a
stool
the
uses
of
which
are
only
revealed
to
the
initiated
she
is
received
by
the
matronly
friends
of
the
mother
and
begins
the
mysteries
by
opening
every
lock
and
lid
in
the
house
during
this
ceremony
the
maiden
females
are
excluded
the
rites
which
succeed
the
baptism
of
a
child
are
still
more
recondite
four
or
five
days
after
the
christening
the
midwife
prepares
with
her
own
mystical
hands
certain
savoury
messes
spreads
a
table
and
places
them
on
it
she
then
departs
and
all
the
family
leaving
the
door
open
in
silence
retire
to
sleep
this
table
is
covered
for
the
miri
of
the
child
an
occult
being
that
is
supposed
to
have
the
care
of
its
destiny
in
the
course
of
the
night
if
the
child
is
to
be
fortunate
the
miri
comes
and
partakes
of
the
feast
generally
in
the
shape
of
a
cat
but
if
the
miri
do
not
come
nor
taste
of
the
food
the
child
is
considered
to
have
been
doomed
to
misfortune
and
misery
and
no
doubt
the
treatment
it
afterwards
receives
is
consonant
to
its
evil
predestination
the
albanians
have
like
the
vulgar
of
all
countries
a
species
of
hearth
or
household
superstitions
distinct
from
their
wild
and
imperfect
religion
they
imagine
that
mankind
after
death
become
voorthoolakases
and
often
pay
visits
to
their
friends
and
foes
for
the
same
reasons
and
in
the
same
way
that
our
own
country
ghosts
walk
abroad
and
their
visiting
hour
is
also
midnight
but
the
collyvillory
is
another
sort
of
personage
he
delights
in
mischief
and
pranks
and
is
besides
a
lewd
and
foul
spirit
and
therefore
very
properly
detested
he
is
let
loose
on
the
night
of
the
nativity
with
licence
for
twelve
nights
to
plague
men
wives
at
which
time
some
one
of
the
family
must
keep
wakeful
vigil
all
the
livelong
night
beside
a
clear
and
cheerful
fire
otherwise
this
naughty
imp
would
pour
such
an
aqueous
stream
on
the
hearth
that
fire
could
never
be
kindled
there
again
the
albanians
are
also
pestered
with
another
species
of
malignant
creatures
men
and
women
whose
gifts
are
followed
by
misfortunes
whose
eyes
glimpse
evil
and
by
whose
touch
the
most
prosperous
affairs
are
blasted
they
work
their
malicious
sorceries
in
the
dark
collect
herbs
of
baleful
influence
by
the
help
of
which
they
strike
their
enemies
with
palsy
and
cattle
with
distemper
the
males
are
called
maissi
and
the
females
maissa
witches
and
warlocks
besides
these
curious
superstitious
peculiarities
they
have
among
them
persons
who
pretend
to
know
the
character
of
approaching
events
by
hearing
sounds
which
resemble
those
that
shall
accompany
the
actual
occurrence
having
however
given
lord
byron
account
of
the
adventure
of
his
servant
dervish
at
cape

it
is
unnecessary
to
be
more
particular
with
the
subject
here
indeed
but
for
the
great
impression
which
everything
about
the
albanians
made
on
the
mind
of
the
poet
the
insertion
of
these
memoranda
would
be
irrelevant
they
will
however
serve
to
elucidate
several
allusions
not
otherwise
very
clear
in
those
poems
of
which
the
scenes
are
laid
in
greece
and
tend
in
some
measure
to
confirm
the
correctness
of
the
opinion
that
his
genius
is
much
more
indebted
to
facts
and
actual
adventures
than
to
the
force
of
his
imagination
many
things
regarded
in
his
most
original
productions
as
fancies
and
invention
may
be
traced
to
transactions
in
which
he
was
himself
a

more
interesting
than
in

but
afterwards
in
reading
either
of
the
ancient
or
of
the
modern
inhabitants
it
is
surprising
to
find
how
much
local
knowledge
the
memory
had
unconsciously
acquired
on
the
spot
arising
from
the
variety
of
objects
to
which
the
attention

been
directed
the
best
of
all

works
the
most
racy
and
original
are
undoubtedly
those
which
relate
to
greece
but
it
is
only
travellers
who
have
visited
the
scenes
that
can
appreciate
them
properly
in
them
his
peculiar
style
and
faculty
are
most
eminent
in
all
his
other
productions
imitation
even
mere
translation
may
be
often
traced
and
though
without
question
everything
he
touched
became
transmuted
into
something
more
beautiful
and
precious
yet
he
was
never
so
masterly
as
in
describing
the
scenery
of
greece
and
albanian
manners
in
a
general
estimate
of
his
works
it
may
be
found
that
he
has
produced
as
fine
or
finer
passages
than
any
in
his
grecian
poems
but
their
excellence
either
as
respects
his
own
or
the
productions
of
others
is
comparative
in
the
grecian
poems
he
is
only
truly
original
in
them
the
excellence
is
all
his
own
and
they
possess
the
rare
and
distinguished
quality
of
being
as
true
to
fact
and
nature
as
they
are
brilliant
in
poetical
expression
childe
harold
pilgrimage
is
the
most
faithful
descriptive
poem
which
has
been
written
since
the
odyssey
and
the
occasional
scenes
introduced
into
the
other
poems
when
the
action
is
laid
in
greece
are
equally
vivid
and
glowing
when
i
saw
him
at
athens
the
spring
was
still
shrinking
in
the
bud
it
was
not
until
he
returned
from
constantinople
in
the
following
autumn
that
he
saw
the
climate
and
country
with
those
delightful
aspects
which
he
has
delineated
with
so
much
felicity
in
the
giaour
and
the
corsair
it
may
however
be
mentioned
that
the
fine
description
of
a
calm
sunset
with
which
the
third
canto
of
the
corsair
opens
has
always
reminded
me
of
the
evening
before
his
departure
from
athens
owing
to
the
circumstance
of
my
having
in
the
course
of
the
day
visited
the
spot
which
probably
suggested
the
scene
described
it
was
the
of
march
the
pylades
sloop
of
war
came
that
morning
into
the
piraeus
and
landed
dr
darwin
a
son
of
the
poet
with
his
friend
mr
galton
who
had
come
out
in
her
for
a
cruise
captain
ferguson
her
commander
was
so
kind
as
to
offer
the
english
then
in
athens
lord
byron
mr
hobhouse
and
myself
a
passage
to
smyrna
as
i
had
not
received
my
luggage
from
specia
i
could
not
avail
myself
of
the
offer
but
the
other
two
did
i
accompanied
captain
ferguson
however
and
dr
darwin
in
a
walk
to
the
straits
of
salamis
the
ship
in
the
meantime
after
landing
them
having
been
moored
there
it
was
one
of
those
serene
and
cloudless
days
of
the
early
spring
when
the
first
indications
of
leaf
and
blossom
may
just
be
discerned
the
islands
slept
as
it
were
on
their
glassy
couch
and
a
slight
dun
haze
hung
upon
the
mountains
as
if
they
too
were
drowsy
after
an
easy
walk
of
about
two
hours
passing
through
the
olive
groves
and
along
the
bottom
of
the
hill
on
which
xerxes
sat
to
view
the
battle
we
came
opposite
to
a
little
cove
near
the
ferry
and
made
a
signal
to
the
ship
for
a
boat
having
gone
on
board
and
partaken
of
some
refreshment
the
boat
then
carried
us
back
to
the
piraeus
where
we
landed
about
an
hour
before
sundown
all
the
wide
landscape
presenting
at
the
time
the
calm
and
genial
tranquillity
which
is
almost
experienced
anew

unclouded

of
living

the
yellow
beam
he
throws
gilds
the
green
wave
that
trembles
as
it
flows
on

the
god
of

sheds
his

the
hues
of

till
darkly
shaded
from

and
deep
behind
his
delphian
cliff
he
sinks
to
sleep
the
opening
of
the
giaour
is
a
more
general
description
but
the
locality
is
distinctly
marked
by
reference
to
the
tomb
above
the
rocks
of
the
promontory
commonly
said
to
be
that
of
themistocles
and
yet
the
scene
included
in
it
certainly
is
rather
the
view
from
cape
colonna
than
from
the
heights
of
munychia
no
breath
of
air
to
break
the
wave
that
rolls
below
the
athenian
grave
that
tomb
which
gleaming
the
cliff
first
greets
the
skiff
high
the
land
he
saved
in
vain
when
shall
such
hero
live
again
the
environs
of
the
piraeus
were
indeed
at
that
time
well
calculated
to
inspire
those
mournful
reflections
with
which
the
poet
introduces
the
infidel
impassioned
tale
the
solitude
the
relics
the
decay
and
sad
uses
to
which
the
pirate
and
the
had
put
the
shores
and
waters
so
honoured
by
freedom
rendered
a
visit
to
the

in

to
a

the
loveliness

with

that

no

its

earth
at
that
time
lord
byron
if
he
did
pity
the
condition
of
the
greeks
evinced
very
little
confidence
in
the
resurrection
of
the
nation
even
although
symptoms
of
change
and
reanimation
were
here
and
there
perceptible
and
could
not
have
escaped
his
observation
greece
had
indeed
been
so
long
ruined
that
even
her
desolation
was
then
in
a
state
of
decay
the
new
cycle
in
her
fortunes
had
certainly
not
commenced
but
it
was
manifest
by
many
a
sign
that
the
course
of
the
old
was
concluding
and
that
the
whole
country
felt
the
assuring
auguries
of
undivulged
renovation
the
influence
of
that
period
did
not
however
penetrate
the
bosom
of
the
poet
and
when
he
first
quitted
athens
assuredly
he
cared
as
little
about
the
destinies
of
the
greeks
as
he
did
for
those
of
the
portuguese
and
spaniards
when
he
arrived
at
gibraltar
about
three
weeks
or
a
month
after
he
had
left
athens
i
went
by
a
circuitous
route
to
smyrna
where
i
found
him
waiting
with
mr
hobhouse
to
proceed
with
the
salsette
frigate
then
ordered
to
constantinople
to
bring
away
mr
adair
the
ambassador
he
had
in
the
meantime
visited
ephesus
and
acquired
some
knowledge
of
the
environs
of
smyrna
but
he
appeared
to
have
been
less
interested
by
what
he
had
seen
there
than
by
the
adventures
of
his
albanian
tour
perhaps
i
did
him
injustice
but
i
thought
he
was
also
in
that
short
space
something
changed
and
not
with
improvement
towards
mr
hobhouse
he
seemed
less
cordial
and
was
altogether
i
should
say
having
no
better
phrase
to
express
what
i
would
describe
more
of
a
captain
grand
than
improved
in
his
manners
and
more
disposed
to
hold
his
own
opinion
than
i
had
ever
before
observed
in
him
i
was
particularly
struck
with
this
at
dinner
on
the
day
after
my
arrival
we
dined
together
with
a
large
party
at
the
consul
and
he
seemed
inclined
to
exact
a
deference
to
his
dogmas
that
was
more
lordly
than
philosophical
one
of
the
naval
officers
present
i
think
the
captain
of
the
salsette
felt
as
well
as
others
this
overweening
and
announced
a
contrary
opinion
on
some
question
connected
with
the
politics
of
the
late
mr
pitt
with
so
much
firm
good
sense
that
lord
byron
was
perceptibly
rebuked
by
it
and
became
reserved
as
if
he
deemed
that
sullenness
enhanced
dignity
i
never
in
the
whole
course
of
my
acquaintance
saw
him
kithe
so
unfavourably
as
he
did
on
that
occasion
in
the
course
of
the
evening
however
he
condescended
to
thaw
and
before
the
party
broke
up
his
austerity
began
to
leaf
and
hide
its
thorns
under
the
influence
of
a
relenting
temperament
it
was
however
too
evident
at
least
it
was
so
to
me
that
without
intending
wrong
or
any
offence
the
unchecked
humour
of
his
temper
was
by
its
caprices
calculated
to
prevent
him
from
ever
gaining
that
regard
to
which
his
talents
and
freer
moods
independently
of
his
rank
ought
to
have
entitled
him
such
men
become
objects
of
solicitude
but
never
of
esteem
i
was
also
on
this
occasion
struck
with
another
new
phase
in
his
character
he
seemed
to
be
actuated
by
no
purpose
he
spoke
no
more
of
passing
beyond
aurora
and
the
ganges
but
seemed
disposed
to
let
the
current
of
chances
carry
him
as
it
might
if
he
had
any
specific
object
in
view
it
was
something
that
made
him
hesitate
between
going
home
and
returning
to
athens
when
he
should
have
reached
constantinople
now
become
the
ultimate
goal
of
his
intended
travels
to
what
cause
this
sudden
and
singular
change
both
in
demeanour
and
design
was
owing
i
was
on
the
point
of
saying
it
would
be
fruitless
to
conjecture
but
a
letter
to
his
mother
written
a
few
days
before
my
arrival
at
smyrna
throws
some
light
on
the
sources
of
his
unsatisfied
state
he
appears
by
it
to
have
been
disappointed
of
letters
and
remittances
from
his
agent
and
says
when
i
arrive
at
constantinople
i
shall
determine
whether
to
proceed
into
persia
or
return
which
latter
i
do
not
wish
if
i
can
avoid
it
but
i
have
no
intelligence
from
mr
and
but
one
letter
from
yourself
i
shall
stand
in
need
of
remittances
whether
i
proceed
or
return
i
have
written
to
him
repeatedly
that
he
may
not
plead
ignorance
of
my
situation
for
neglect
here
is
sufficient
evidence
that
the
cause
of
the
undetermined
state
of
his
mind
which
struck
me
so
forcibly
was
owing
to
the
incertitude
of
his
affairs
at
home
and
it
is
easy
to
conceive
that
the
false
dignity
he
assumed
and
which
seemed
so
like
arrogance
was
the
natural
effect
of
the
anxiety
and
embarrassment
he
suffered
and
of
the
apprehension
of
a
person
of
his
rank
being
on
account
of
his
remittances
exposed
to
require
assistance
among
strangers
but
as
the
scope
of
my
task
relates
more
to
the
history
of
his
mind
than
of
his
private
affairs
i

of

ought

his

turn
the
enemy
who
wheels
on
the
instant
he
darts
his
weapon
the
greatest
dexterity
is
requisite
in
these
mimic
battles
to
avoid
the
concurrence
of
the
crowd
and
to
escape
the
random
blows
of
the
flying
djerids
byron
having
satisfied
his
curiosity
with
smyrna
which
is
so
like
every
other
turkish
town
as
to
excite
but
little
interest
set
out
with
mr
hobhouse
on
the
of
march
for
ephesus
as
i
soon
after
passed
along
the
same
road
i
shall
here
describe
what
i
met
with
myself
in
the
course
of
the
journey
it
being
probable
that
the
incidents
were
in
few
respects
different
from
those
which
they
encountered
on
ascending
the
heights
after
leaving
smyrna
the
road
was
remarkable
in
being
formed
of
the
broken
relics
of
ancient
edifices
partly
macadamised
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
i
met
a
numerous
caravan
of
camels
coming
from
the
interior
of
asia
these
ships
of
the
desert
variously
loaded
were
moving
slowly
to
their
port
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
rode
past
them
that
the
composed
docile
look
of
the
animals
possessed
a
sort
of
domesticated
grace
which
lessened
the
effect
of
their
deformity
a
caravan
owing
to
the
oriental
dresses
of
the
passengers
and
attendants
with
the
numerous
grotesque
circumstances
which
it
presents
to
the
stranger
affords
an
amusing
spectacle
on
the
back
of
one
camel
three
or
four
children
were
squabbling
in
a
basket
in
another
cooking
utensils
were
clattering
and
from
a
crib
on
a
third
a
young
camel
looked
forth
inquiringly
on
the
world
a
long
desultory
train
of
and
cattle
brought
up
the
rear
on
reaching
the
summit
of
the
hills
behind
smyrna
the
road
lies
through
fields
and
well
cultivated
and
interspersed
with
country
houses
after
an
easy
ride
of
three
or
four
hours
i
passed
through
the
ruins
of
a
considerable
turkish
town
containing
four
or
five
mosques
one
of
them
a
handsome
building
still
entire
about
twenty
houses
or
so
might
be
described
as
tenantable
but
only
a
place
of
sepulchres
could
be
more
awful
it
had
been
depopulated
by
the
plague
all
was
silent
and
the
streets
were
matted
with
thick
grass
in
passing
through
an
open
space
which
reminded
me
of
a
i
heard
the
cuckoo
with
an
indescribable
sensation
of
pleasure
mingled
with
solemnity
the
sudden
presence
of
a
raven
at
a
bridal
banquet
could
scarcely
have
been
a
greater
phantasma
proceeding
briskly
from
this
forsaken
and
dead
city
i
arrived
in
the
course
of
about
half
an
hour
at
a
on
the
banks
of
a
small
stream
where
i
partook
of
some
refreshment
in
the
shade
of
three
or
four
trees
on
which
several
storks
were
conjugally
building
their
nests
while
resting
there
i
became
interested
in
their
work
and
observed
that
when
any
of
their
acquaintances
happened
to
fly
past
with
a
stick
they
chattered
a
sort
of
d
to
one
another
this
civility
was
so
uniformly
and
reciprocally
performed
that
the
politeness
of
the
stork
may
be
regarded
as
even
less
disputable
than
its
piety
the
road
from
that
lies
for
a
mile
or
two
along
the
side
of
a
marshy
lake
the
environs
of
which
are
equally
dreary
and
barren
an
extensive
plain
succeeds
on
which
i
noticed
several
broken
columns
of
marble
and
the
evident
traces
of
an
ancient
causeway
which
apparently
led
through
the
water
near
the
extremity
of
the
lake
was
another
small
with
a
and
a
mosque
near
it
and
about
four
or
five
miles
beyond
i
passed
a
spot
to
which
several
turks
brought
a
coffinless
corpse
and
laid
it
on
the
grass
while
they
silently
dug
a
grave
to
receive
it
the
road
then
ascended
the
hills
on
the
south
side
of
the
plain
of
which
the
marshy
lake
was
the
centre
and
passed
through
a
tract
of
country
calculated
to
inspire
only
apprehension
and
melancholy
not
a
habitation
nor
vestige
of
living
man
was
in
sight
but
several
cemeteries
with
their
dull
funereal
cypresses
and
tombstones
served
to
show
that
the
country
had
once
been
inhabited
just
as
the
earliest
stars
began
to
twinkle
i
arrived
at
a
third
on
the
roadside
with
a
little
mosque
before
it
a
spreading
beech
tree
for
travellers
to
recline
under
in
the
spring
and
a
rude
shed
for
them
in
showers
or
the
more
intense
sunshine
of
summer
here
i
rested
for
the
night
and
in
the
morning
at
daybreak
resumed
my
journey
after
a
short
ride
i
reached
the
borders
of
the
plain
of
ephesus
across
which
i
passed
along
a
road
rudely
constructed
and
raised
above
the
marsh
consisting
of
broken
pillars
entablatures
and
inscriptions
at
the
end
of
which
two
other
paths
diverge
one
strikes
off
to
the
left
and
leads
over
the
cayster
by
a
bridge
above
the
castle
of
aiasaluk
the
other
leading
to
the
right
or
west
goes
directly
to
scala
nuova
the
ancient
neapolis
by
the
latter
byron
and
his
friend
proceeded
towards
the
ferry
which
they
crossed
and
where
they
found
the
river
about
the
size
of
the
cam
at
cambridge
but
more
rapid
and
deeper
they
then
rode
up
the
south
bank
and
about
three
in
the
afternoon
arrived
at
aiasaluk
the
miserable
village
which
now
represents
the
city
of
ephesus
having
put
up
their
beds
in
a
mean
khan
the
only
one
in
the
town
they
partook
of
some
cold
provisions
which
they
had
brought
with
them
on
a
stone
seat
by
the
side
of
a
fountain
on
an
open
green
near
to
a
mosque
shaded
with
tall
cypresses
during
their
repast
a
young
turk
approached
the
fountain
and
after
washing
his
feet
and
hands
mounted
a
flat
stone
placed
evidently
for
the
purpose
on
the
top
of
the
wall
surrounding
the
mosque
and
devoutly
said
his
prayers
totally
regardless
of
their
appearance
and
operations
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
exploring
the
ruins
of
aiasaluk
and
next
morning
they
proceeded
to
examine
those
of
the
castle
and
the
mouldering
magnificence
of
ephesus
the
remains
of
the
celebrated
temple
of
diana
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
ancient
world
could
not
be
satisfactorily
traced
fragments
of
walls
and
arches
which
had
been
plated
with
marble
were
all
they
could
discover
with
many
broken
columns
that
had
once
been
mighty
in
their
altitude
and
strength
several
fragments
were
fifteen
feet
long
and
of
enormous
circumference
such
is
the
condition
of
that
superb
edifice
which
was
in
its
glory
four
hundred
and
twenty
feet
long
by
two
hundred
and
twenty
feet
broad
and
adorned
with
more
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
columns
sixty
feet
high
when
the
travellers
had
satisfied
their
curiosity
if
that
can
be
called
satisfaction
which
found
no
entire
form
but
saw
only
the
rubbish
of
desolation
and
the
fragments
of
destruction
they
returned
to
smyrna
the
investigation
of
the
ruins
of
ephesus
was
doubtless
interesting
at
the
time
but
the
visit
produced
no
such
impression
on
the
mind
of
byron
as
might
have
been
expected
he
never
directly
refers
to
it
in
his
works
indeed
after
athens
the
relics
of
ephesus
are
things
but
of
small
import
especially
to
an
imagination
which
like
that
of
the
poet
required
the
action
of
living
characters
to
awaken
its
dormant
sympathies

in

time
through
the

woods
with
which
the

is
covered
and
the
first
vestiges
of
antiquity
which
attracted
their
attention
were
two
large
granite
sarcophagi
a
little
beyond
they
found
two
or
three
fragments
of
granite
pillars
one
of
them
about
feet
in
length
and
at
least
five
in
diameter
near
these
they
saw
arches
of
and
on
the
east
of
them
those
magnificent
remains
to
which
early
travellers
have
given
the
name
of
the
palace
of
priam
but
which
are
in
fact
the
ruins
of
ancient
baths
an
earthquake
in
the
course
of
the
preceding
winter
had
thrown
down
large
portions
of
them
and
the
internal
divisions
of
the
edifice
were
in
consequence
choked
with
huge
masses
of
mural
wrecks
and
marbles
the
visitors
entered
the
interior
through
a
gap
and
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
enormous
ruins
enclosed
on
two
sides
by
walls
raised
on
arches
and
by
piles
of
ponderous
fragments
the
fallen
blocks
were
of
vast
dimensions
and
showed
that
no
cement
had
been
used
in
the
construction
an
evidence
of
their
great
antiquity
in
the
midst
of
this
crushed
magnificence
stood
several
lofty
portals
and
arches
pedestals
of
gigantic
columns
and
broken
steps
and
marble
cornices
heaped
in
desolate
confusion
from
these
baths
the
distance
to
the

is
between
two
and
three
miles
a
gentle
declivity
covered
with
low
woods
and
partially
interspersed
with
spots
of
cultivated
ground
on
this
slope
the
ancient
city
of
alexandria

was
built
on
the
part
of
the
walls
to
the
extent
of
a
mile
may
yet
be
traced
the
remains
of
a
theatre
are
also
still
to
be
seen
on
the
side
of
the
hill
fronting
the
sea
commanding
a
view
of
tenedos
lemnos
and
the
whole
expanse
of
the
aegean
having
been
conducted
by
the
guide
whom
they
had
brought
with
them
from
tenedos
to
the
principal
antiquities
of
alexandria
troas
the
visitors
returned
to
the
frigate
which
immediately
after
got
under
way
on
the
of
april
she
came
to
anchor
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
cape
janissary
the
sygean
promontory
where
she
remained
about
a
fortnight
during
which
ample
opportunity
was
afforded
to
inspect
the
plain
of
troy
that
scene
of
heroism
which
for
three
thousand
years
has
attracted
the
attention
and
interested
the
feelings
and
fancy
of
the
civilized
world
whether
lord
byron
entertained
any
doubt
of
homer
troy
ever
having
existed
is
not
very
clear
it
is
probable
from
the
little
he
says
on
the
subject
that
he
took
no
interest
in
the
question
for
although
no
traveller
could
enter
with
more
sensibility
into
the
local
associations
of
celebrated
places
he
yet
never
seemed
to
care
much
about
the
visible
features
of
antiquity
and
was
always
more
inclined
to
indulge
in
reflections
than
to
puzzle
his
learning
with
dates
or
dimensions
his
ruminations
on
the
troad
in
don
juan
afford
an
instance
of
this
and
are
conceived
in
the
very
spirit
of
childe
harold
and
so
great
names
are
nothing
more
than
nominal
and
love
of
glory
but
an
airy
lust
too
often
in
its
fury
overcoming
all
who
would
as
identify
their
dust
from
out
the
wide
destruction
which
entombing
all
leaves
nothing
till
the
coming
of
the
just
save
change
i
stood
upon
achilles
tomb
and
heard
troy
doubted
time
will
doubt
of
rome
the
very
generations
of
the
dead
are
swept
away
and
tomb
inherits
tomb
until
the
memory
of
an
age
is
fled
and
buried
sinks
beneath
its
offspring
doom
where
are
the
epitaphs
our
fathers
read
save
a
few
glean
from
the
sepulchral
gloom
which
once
named
myriads
nameless
lie
beneath
and
lose
their
own
in
universal
death
no
task
of
curiosity
can
indeed
be
less
satisfactory
that
the
examination
of
the
sites
of
ancient
cities
for
the
guides
not
content
with
leading
the
traveller
to
the
spot
often
attempt
to
mislead
his
imagination
by
directing
his
attention
to
circumstances
which
they
suppose
to
be
evidence
that
verifies
their
traditions
thus
on
the
trojan
plain
several
objects
are
still
shown
which
are
described
as
the
mentioned
in
the
iliad
the
wild
trees
and
the
tomb
of
ilus
are
yet
there
if
the
guides
may
be
credited
but
they
were
seen
with
incredulous
eyes
by
the
poet
even
the
tomb
of
achilles
appears
to
have
been
regarded
by
him
with
equal
scepticism
still
his
description
of
the
scene
around
is
striking
and
tinted
with
some
of
his
happiest
touches
there
on
the
green
and
hill
is
flanked
by
the
hellespont
and
by
the
sea
entomb
the
bravest
of
the
brave
achilles
they
say
so
bryant
says
the
contrary
and
farther
downward
tall
and
towering
still
is
the
tumulus
of
whom
heaven
knows
it
may
be
patroclus
ajax
or
protesilaus
all
heroes
who
if
living
still
would
slay
us
high
barrows
without
marble
or
a

a
vast
untill
and
plain
and
ida
in
the
distance
still
the
same
and
old
scamander
if
is
he
remain
the
situation
seems
still
form
for
fame
a
hundred
thousand
men
might
fight
again
with
ease
but
where
i
sought
for
ilion
walls
the
quiet
sheep
feeds
and
the

crawls
troops
of
untended
horses
here
and
there
some
little
hamlets
with
new
names
uncouth
some
shepherds
unlike
paris
led
to
stare
a
moment
at
the
european
youth
whom
to
the
spot
their
schoolboy
feelings
bear
a
turk
with
beads
in
hand
and
pipe
in
mouth
extremely
taken
with
his
own
religion
are
what
i
found
there
but
the
devil
a
phrygian
it
was
during
the
time
that
the
salsette
lay
off
cape
janissary
that
lord
byron
first
undertook
to
swim
across
the
hellespont
having
crossed
from
the
castle
of
in
a
boat
manned
by
four
turks
he
landed
at
five
in
the
evening
half
a
mile
above
the
castle
of
where
with
an
officer
of
the
frigate
who
accompanied
him
they
began
their
enterprise
emulous
of
the
renown
of
leander
at
first
they
swam
obliquely
upwards
rather
towards
nagara
point
than
the
dardanelles
but
notwithstanding
their
skill
and
efforts
they
made
little
progress
finding
it
useless
to
struggle
with
the
current
they
then
turned
and
went
with
the
stream
still
however
endeavouring
to
cross
it
was
not
until
they
had
been
half
an
hour
in
the
water
and
found
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
strait
about
a
mile
and
a
half
below
the
castles
that
they
consented
to
be
taken
into
the
boat
which
had
followed
them
by
that
time
the
coldness
of
the
water
had
so
benumbed
their
limbs
that
they
were
unable
to
stand
and
were
otherwise
much
exhausted
the
second
attempt
was
made
on
the
of
may
when
the
weather
was
warmer
they
entered
the
water
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
and
above
near
a
point
of
land
on
the
western
bank
of
the
bay
of
maito
and
swam
against
the
stream
as
before
but
not
for
so
long
a
time
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
came
floating
down
the
current
close
to
the
ship
which
was
then
anchored
at
the
dardanelles
and
in
passing
her
steered
for
the
bay
behind
the
castle
which
they
soon
succeeded
in
reaching
and
landed
about
a
mile
and
below
the
ship
lord
byron
has
recorded
that
he
found
the
current
very
strong
and
the
water
cold
that
some
large

of

and
though
a
little
chilled
he
was
not
fatigued
and
performed
the
feat
without
much
difficulty
but
not
with
impunity
for
by
the
verses
in
which
he
commemorated
the
exploit
it
appears
he
incurred
the

written
after
swimming
from

though
in
the
genial
month
of
may
my
dripping
limbs
i
faintly
stretch
and
think
i
done
a
feat
but
since
he
crossed
the
rapid

according
to
the

and
swam
for

as
i
for

to

plague
you
he
lost
his
labour
i
my
jest
for
he
was
drown
and
i
the
ague
the
whole
distance
says
his
lordship
from
the
place
whence
we
started
to
our
landing
on
the
other
side
including
the
length
we
were
carried
by
the
current
was
computed
by
those
on
board
the
frigate
at
upwards
of
four
english
miles
though
the
actual
breadth
is
barely
one
the
rapidity
of
the
current
is
such
that
no
boat
can
row
directly
across
and
it
may
in
some
measure
be
estimated
from
the
circumstance
of
the
whole
distance
being
accomplished
by
one
of
the
parties
in
an
hour
and
five
and
by
the
other
byron
in
an
hour
and
ten
minutes
the
water
was
extremely
cold
from
the
melting
of
the
mountain
snows
about
three
weeks
before
in
april
we
had
made
an
attempt
but
having
ridden
all
the
way
from
the
troad
the
same
morning
and
the
water
being
of
an
icy
chilliness
we
found
it
necessary
to
postpone
the
completion
till
the
frigate
anchored
below
the
castles
when
we
swam
the
straits
as
just
stated
entering
a
considerable
way
above
the
european
and
landing
below
the
asiatic
fort
chevallier
says
that
a
young
jew
swam
the
same
distance
for
his
mistress
and
oliver
mentions
it
having
been
done
by
a
neapolitan
but
our
consul
at
the
dardanelles
tarragona
remembered
neither
of
these
circumstances
and
tried
to
dissuade
us
from
the
attempt
a
number
of
the
salsette
crew
were
known
to
have
accomplished
a
greater
distance
and
the
only
thing
that
surprised
me
was
that
as
doubts
had
been
entertained
of
the
truth
of
story
no
traveller
had
ever
endeavoured
to
ascertain
its
practicability
while
the
salsette
lay
off
the
dardanelles
lord
byron
saw
the
body
of
a
man
who
had
been
executed
by
being
cast
into
the
sea
floating
on
the
stream
moving
to
and
fro
with
the
tumbling
of
the
water
which
gave
to
his
arms
the
effect
of
scaring
away
several
that
were
hovering
to
devour
this
incident
he
has
strikingly
depicted
in
the
bride
of
abydos
the
shriek
above
the
prey
which
their
hungry
beaks
delay
as
shaken
on
his
restless
pillow
his
head
heaves
with
the
heaving
billow
that
hand
whose
motion
is
not
life
yet
feebly
seems
to
menace
strife
flung
by
the
tossing
tide
on
high
then
levell
with
the
wave
what
reeks
it
tho
that
corse
shall
lie
within
a
living

seen
those

limbs

and

above
his
turban
stone
that

hath
burst
that

was
closed
yea
closed
before
his

between
the
dardanelles

no
other
adventure
was
undertaken

the

the
of

the

came
to

at
sunset
near
the

the
west
of

and
when
the
night
closed
in
the
silence
and
the
darkness
were
so
complete
that
we
might
have
believed
ourselves
says
mr
hobhouse
moored
in
the
lonely
cove
of
some
desert
island
and
not
at
the
foot
of
a
city
which
from
its
vast
extent

countless
population
is
fondly
imagined
by
its
present
masters
to
be

an

of

a

tall

minarets

the
domes

are

inland
on

the
redoubted
castle
of
the
seven
towers
is
seen
rising
above
the
gloomy
walls
and
unlike
every
other
european
city
a
profound
silence
prevails
over
all
this
remarkable
characteristic
of
constantinople
is
owing
to
the
very
few
employed
in
the
city
in
other
respects
the
view
around
is
lively
and
in
fine
weather
quickened
with
innumerable
objects
in
motion
in
the
calmest
days
the
rippling
in
the
flow
of
the
bosphorus
is
like
the
running
of
a
river
in
the
fifth
canto
of
don
juan
lord
byron
has
seized
the
principal
features
and
delineated
them
with
sparkling
effect
the
european
with
the
asian
shore
sprinkled
with
palaces
the

charm
the
charming

montague
in
the
morning
when
his
lordship
left
the
ship
the
wind
blew
strongly
from
the
and
the
rushing
current
of
the
bosphorus
dashed
with
great
violence
against
the
rocky
projections
of
the
shore
as
the
captain
boat
was
rowed
against
the
stream
the
wind
swept
down
the
euxine
and
the
wave
broke
foaming
the
blue
symplegades
is
a
grand
sight
from
off
the
giant
grave
to
watch
the
progress
of
those
rolling
seas
between
the
bosphorus
as
they
lash
and
lave
europe
and
asia
you
being
quite
at
ease
the
sensations
produced
by
the
state
of
the
weather
and
leaving
a
comfortable
cabin
were
says
mr
hobhouse
in
unison
with
the
impressions
which
we
felt
when
passing
under
the
palace
of
the
sultans
and
gazing
at
the
gloomy
cypresses
which
rise
above
the
walls
we
saw
two
dogs
gnawing
a
dead
body
the
description
in
the
siege
of
corinth
of
the
dogs
devouring
the
dead
owes
its
origin
to
this
incident
of
the
dogs
and
the
body
under
the
walls
of
the
seraglio
and
he
saw
the
lean
dogs
beneath
the
wall
hold
the
dead
their
carnival
gorging
and
growling
carcase
and
limb
they
were
too
busy
to
bark
at
him
from
a
tartar
scull
they
had
stripp
the
flesh
as
ye
peel
the
fig
when
its
fruit
is
fresh
and
their
white
tusks
crunched
on
the
whiter
scull
as
it
slipp
through
their
jaws
when
their
edge
grew
dull
as
they
lazily
mumbled
the
bones
of
the
dead
when
they
scarce
could
rise
from
the
spot
where
they
fed
so
well
had
they
broken
a
lingering
fast
with
those
who
had
fallen
for
that
night
repast
and
alp
knew
by
the
turbans
that
rolled
on
the
sand
the
foremost
of
these
were
the
best
of
his
band
crimson
and
green
were
the
shawls
of
their
wear
and
each
scalp
had
a
single
long
tuft
of
hair
all
the
rest
was
shaven
and
bare
the
scalps
were
in
the
wild
dogs
maw
the
hair
was
tangled
round
his
jaw
but
close
by
the
shore
on
the
edge
of
the
gulf
there
sat
a
vulture
flapping
a
wolf
who
had
stolen
from
the
hills
but
kept
away
scared
by
the
dogs
from
the
human
prey
but
he
seized
on
his
share
of
a
steed
that
lay
pick
by
the
birds
on
the
sands
of
the
bay
this
hideous
picture
is
a
striking
instance
of
the
uses
to
which
imaginative
power
may
turn
the
slightest
hint
and
of
horror
augmented
till
it
reach
that
extreme
point
at
which
the
ridiculous
commences
the
whole
compass
of
english
poetry
affords
no
parallel
to
this
passage
it
even
exceeds
the
celebrated
catalogue
of
dreadful
things
on
the
sacramental
table
in
tam
o
shanter
it
is
true
that
the
revolting
circumstances
described
by
byron
are
less
sublime
in
their
associations
than
those
of
burns
being
mere
visible
images
unconnected
with
ideas
of
guilt
and
unlike
the
knife
a
father
throat
had
mangled
which
his
ain
son
of
life
bereft
the
gray
hairs
yet
stuck
to
the
heft
nor
is
there
in
the
vivid
group
of
the
vulture
flapping
the
wolf
any
accessory
to
rouse
stronger
emotions
than
those
which
are
associated
with
the
sight
of
energy
and
courage
while
the
covert
insinuation
that
the
bird
is
actuated
by
some
instigation
of
retribution
in
pursuing
the
wolf
for
having
run
away
with
the
bone
approaches
the
very
point
and
line
where
the
horrible
merges
in
the
ludicrous
the
whole
passage
is
fearfully
distinct
and
though
in
its
circumstances
as
the
poet
himself
says
sickening
is
yet
an
amazing
display
of
poetical
power
and
high
invention
the
frigate
sent
the
travellers
on
shore
at
tophana
from
which
the
road
ascends
to
pera
near
this
is
a
large
fountain
and
around
it
a
public
stand
of
horses
ready
saddled
attended
by
boys
on
some
of
these
lord
byron
and
his
friend
with
the
officers
who
had
accompanied
them
mounted
and
rode
up
the
steep
hill
to
the
principal
frank
hotel
in
pera
where
they
intended
to
lodge
in
the
course
of
the
ride
their
attention
was
attracted
to
the
prodigious
number
of
masterless
dogs
which
lounge
and
lurk
about
the
corners
of
the
streets
a
nuisance
both
dangerous
and
disagreeable
but
which
the
turks
not
only
tolerate
but
protect
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
to
see
a
litter
of
puppies
with
their
mother
nestled
in
a
mat
placed
on
purpose
for
them
in
a
nook
by
some
charitable
mussulman
of
the
neighbourhood
for
notwithstanding
their
merciless
military
practices
the
turks
are
titans
to
dumb
animals
and
slaves
constantinople
has
however
been
so
often
and
so
well
described
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
notice
its
different
objects
of
curiosity
here
except
in
so
far
as
they
have
been
contributory
to
the
stores
of
the
poet
the
slave
market
was
of
course
not
unvisited
but
the
description
in
don
juan
is
more
indebted
to
the
author
fancy
than
any
of
those
other
bright
reflections
of
realities
to
which
i
have
hitherto
directed
the
attention
of
the
reader
the
market
is
in
truth
very
uninteresting
few
slaves
are
ever
to
be
seen
in
it
and
the
place
itself
has
an
odious
resemblance
to
smithfield
i
imagine
therefore
that
the
trade
in
slaves
is
chiefly
managed
by
private
bargaining
when
there
i
saw
only
two
men
for
sale
whites
who
appeared
very
little
concerned
about
their
destination
certainly
not
more
than
english
rustics
offering
themselves
for
hire
to
the
farmers
at
a
fair
or
market
doubtless
there
was
a
time
when
the
slave
market
of
constantinople
presented
a
different
spectacle
but
the
trade
itself
has
undergone
a
change
the
christians
are
now
interdicted
from
purchasing
slaves
the
luxury
of
the
guilt
is
reserved
for
the
exclusive
enjoyment
of
the
turks
still
as
a
description
of
things
which
may
have
been
byron
market
is
probable
and
curious
a
crowd
of
shivering
slaves
of
every
nation
and
age
and
sex
were
in
the
market
ranged
each
busy
with
the
merchant
in
his
station
poor
creatures
their
good
looks
were
sadly
changed
all
save
the
blacks
seem
jaded
with
vexation
from
friends
and
home
and
freedom
far
estranged
the
negroes
more
philosophy
displayed
used
to
it
no
doubt
as
eels
are
to
be
flayed
like
a
backgammon
board
the
place
was
dotted
with
whites
and
blacks
in
groups
on
show
for
sale
though
rather
more
irregularly
spotted
some
bought
the
jet
while
others
chose
the
pale
no
lady
is
ogled
by
a
lover
horse
by
a
broadcloth
by
a
tailor
fee
by
a
counsel
felon
by
a
jailer
as
is
a
slave
by
his
intended
bidder
is
pleasant
purchasing
our
and
all
are
to
be
sold
if
you
consider
their
passions
and
are
some
by
features
are
bought
up
others
by
a
warlike
leader
some
by
a
place
as
tend
their
years
or
natures
the
most
by
ready
cash
but
all
have
prices
from
crowns
to
kicks
according
to
their
vices
the
account
of
the
interior
of
the
seraglio
in
don
juan
is
also
only
probably
correct
and
may
have
been
drawn
in
several
particulars
from
an
inspection
of
some
of
the
palaces
but
the
descriptions
of
the
imperial
harem
are
entirely
fanciful
i
am
persuaded
by
different
circumstances
that
byron
could
not
have
been
in
those
sacred
chambers
of
any
of
the
seraglios
at
the
time
i
was
in
constantinople
only
one
of
the
imperial
residences
was
accessible
to
strangers
and
it
was
unfurnished
the
great
seraglio
was
not
accessible
beyond
the
courts
except
in
those
apartments
where
the
sultan
receives
his
officers
and
visitors
of
state
indeed
the
whole
account
of
the
customs
and
usages
of
the
interior
of
the
seraglio
as
described
in
don
juan
can
only
be
regarded
as
inventions
and
though
the
descriptions
abound
in
picturesque
beauty
they
have
not
that
air
of
truth
and
fact
about
them
which
render
the
pictures
of
byron
so
generally
valuable
independent
of
their
poetical
excellence
in
those
he
has
given
of
the
apartments
of
the
men
the
liveliness
and
fidelity
of
his
pencil
can
not
be
denied
but
the
arabian
tales
and
vathek
seem
to
have
had
more
influence
on
his
fancy
in
describing
the
imperial
harem
than
a
knowledge
of
actual
things
and
appearances
not
that
the
latter
are
inferior
to
the
former
in
beauty
or
are
without
images
and
lineaments
of
graphic
distinctness
but
they
want
that
air
of
reality
which
constitutes
the
singular
excellence
of
his
scenes
drawn
from
nature
and
there
is
a
vagueness
in
them
which
has
the
effect
of
making
them
obscure
and
even
fantastical
indeed
except
when
he
paints
from
actual
models
from
living
persons
and
existing
things
his
superiority
at
least
his
originality
is
not
so
obvious
and
thus
it
happens
that
his
gorgeous
description
of
the
sultan
seraglio
is
like
a
versified
passage
of
an
arabian
tale
while
the
imagery
of
childe
visit
to
ali
pasha
has
all
the
freshness
and
life
of
an
actual
scene
the
following
is
indeed
more
like
an
imitation
of
vathek
than
anything
that
has
been
seen
or
is
in
existence
i
quote
it
for
the
contrast
it
affords
to
the
visit
referred
to
and
in
illustration
of
the
distinction
which
should
be
made
between
beauties
derived
from
actual
scenes
and
adventures
and
compilations
from
memory
and
imagination
which
are
supposed
to
display
so
much
more
of
creative
invention
and
thus
they
parted
each
by
separate
doors
raba
led
juan
onward
room
by
room
through
glittering
galleries
and
marble
floors
till
a
gigantic
portal
through
the
gloom
haughty
and
huge
along
the
distance
towers
and
wafted
far
arose
a
rich
perfume
it
seem
as
though
they
came
upon
a
shrine
for
all
was
vast
still
fragrant
and
divine
the
giant
door
was
broad
and
bright
and
high
of
gilded
bronze
and
carved
in
curious
guise
warriors
thereon
were
battling
furiously
here
stalks
the
victor
there
the
vanquish
lies
there
captives
led
in
triumph

the
eye
and
in
perspective
many
a
squadron
flies
it
seems
the
work
of
times
before
the
line
of

fell
with
constantine
this
massy
portal
stood
at
the
wide
close
of
a
huge
hall
and
on
its
either
side
two
little
dwarfs
the
least
you
could
suppose
were

ugly

the
adventure
on
which
the
giaour
is
founded
although
lord
byron
remained
two
months
in
constantinople
and
visited
every
object
of
interest
and
curiosity
within
and
around
it
he
yet
brought
away
with
him
fewer
poetical
impressions
than
from
any
other
part
of
the
ottoman
dominions
at
least
he
has
made
less
use
in
his
works
of
what
he
saw
and
learned
there
than
of
the
materials
he
collected
in
other
places
from
whatever
cause
it
arose
the
which
i
had
noticed
at
smyrna
was
remarked
about
him
while
he
was
in
the
capital
and
the
same
jealousy
of
his
rank
was
so
nervously
awake
that
it
led
him
to
attempt
an
obtrusion
on
the
ambassadorial
etiquettes
which
he
probably
regretted
it
has
grown
into
a
custom
at
constantinople
when
the
foreign
ministers
are
admitted
to
audiences
of
ceremony
with
the
sultan
to
allow
the
subjects
and
travellers
of
their
respective
nations
to
accompany
them
both
to
swell
the
pomp
of
the
spectacle
and
to
gratify
their
curiosity
mr
adair
our
ambassador
for
whom
the
salsette
had
been
sent
had
his
audience
of
leave
appointed
soon
after
lord
byron
arrival
and
his
lordship
was
particularly
anxious
to
occupy
a
station
of
distinction
in
the
procession
the
pretension
was
ridiculous
in
itself
and
showed
less
acquaintance
with
courtly
ceremonies
than
might
have
been
expected
in
a
person
of
his
rank
and
intelligence
mr
adair
assured
him
that
he
could
obtain
no
particular
place
that
in
the
arrangements
for
the
ceremonial
only
the
persons
connected
with
the
embassy
could
be
considered
and
that
the
turks
neither
acknowledged
the
precedence
nor
could
be
requested
to
consider
the
distinctions
of
our
nobility
byron
however
still
persisted
and
the
minister
was
obliged
to
refer
him
on
the
subject
to
the
austrian
internuncio
a
high
authority
in
questions
of
etiquette
whose
opinion
was
decidedly
against
the
pretension
the
pride
of
rank
was
indeed
one
of
the
greatest
weaknesses
of
lord
byron
and
everything
even
of
the
most
accidental
kind
which
seemed
to
come
between
the
wind
and
his
nobility
was
repelled
on
the
spot
i
recollect
having
some
debate
with
him
once
respecting
a
pique
of
etiquette
which
happened
between
him
and
sir
william
drummond
somewhere
in
portugal
or
spain
sir
william
was
at
the
time
an
ambassador
not
however
i
believe
in
the
country
where
the
incident
occurred
and
was
on
the
point
of
taking
precedence
in
passing
from
one
room
to
another
when
byron
stepped
in
before
him
the
action
was
undoubtedly
rude
on
the
part
of
his
lordship
even
though
sir
william
had
presumed
too
far
on
his
riband
to
me
it
seemed
also
wrong
for
by
the
custom
of
all
nations
from
time
immemorial
ambassadors
have
been
allowed
their
official
rank
in
passing
through
foreign
countries
while
peers
in
the
same
circumstances
claim
no
rank
at
all
even
in
our
own
colonies
it
has
been
doubted
if
they
may
take
precedence
of
the
legislative
counsellors
but
the
rights
of
rank
are
best
determined
by
the
heralds
and
i
have
only
to
remark
that
it
is
almost
inconceivable
that
such
things
should
have
so
morbidly
affected
the
sensibility
of
lord
byron
yet
they
certainly
did
so
and
even
to
a
ridiculous
degree
on
one
occasion
when
he
lodged
in
st
james
street
i
recollect
him
rating
the
footman
for
using
a
double
knock
in
accidental
thoughtlessness
these
little
infirmities
are
however
at
most
only
calculated
to
excite
a
smile
there
is
no
turpitude
in
them
and
they
merit
notice
but
as
indications
of
the
humour
of
character
it
was
his
foible
to
overrate
his
rank
to
grudge
his
deformity
beyond
reason
and
to
exaggerate
the
condition
of
his
family
and
circumstances
but
the
alloy
of
such
small
vanities
his
caprice
and
feline
temper
were
as
vapour
compared
with
the
mass
of
rich
and
rare
ore
which
constituted
the
orb
and
nucleus
of
his
brilliancy
he
had
not
been
long
in
constantinople
when
a
change
came
over
his
intentions
the
journey
to
persia
was
abandoned
and
the
dreams
of
india
were
dissolved
the
particular
causes
which
produced
this
change
are
not
very
apparent
but
mr
hobhouse
was
at
the
same
time
directed
to
return
home
and
perhaps
that
circumstance
had
some
influence
on
his
decision
which
he
communicated
to
his
mother
informing
her
that
he
should
probably
return
to
greece
as
in
that
letter
he
alludes
to
his
embarrassment
on
account
of
remittances
it
is
probable
that
the
neglect
of
his
agent
with
respect
to
them
was
the
main
cause
which
induced
him
to
determine
on
going
no
farther
accordingly
on
the
of
july
he
embarked
with
mr
hobhouse
and
the
ambassador
on
board
the
salsette
it
was
in
the
course
of
the
passage
to
the
island
of
zea
where
he
was
put
on
shore
that
one
of
the
most
emphatic
incidents
of
his
life
occurred
an
incident
which
throws
a
remarkable
gleam
into
the
springs
and
intricacies
of
his
character
more
perhaps
than
anything
which
has
yet
been
mentioned
one
day
as
he
was
walking
the
he
lifted
an
ataghan
it
might
be
one
of
the
midshipmen
weapons
and
unsheathing
it
said
contemplating
the
blade
i
should
like
to
know
how
a
person
feels
after
committing
murder
by
those
who
have
inquiringly
noticed
the
extraordinary
cast
of
his
metaphysical
associations
this
scene
must
be
regarded
as
both
impressive
and
solemn
although
the
wish
to
know
how
a
man
felt
after
committing
murder
does
not
imply
any
desire
to
perpetrate
the
crime
the
feeling
might
be
appreciated
by
experiencing
any
actual
degree
of
guilt
for
it
is
not
the
deed
the
sentiment
which
follows
it
makes
the
horror
but
it
is
doing
injustice
to
suppose
the
expression
of
such
a
wish
dictated
by
desire
lord
byron
has
been
heard
to
express
in
the
eccentricity
of
conversation
wishes
for
a
more
intense
knowledge
of
remorse
than
murder
itself
could
give
there
is
however
a
wide
and
wild
difference
between
the
curiosity
that
prompts
the
wish
to
know
the
exactitude
of
any
feeling
or
idea
and
the
direful
passions
that
instigate
to
guilty
gratifications
being
landed
according
to
his
request
with
his
valet
two
albanians
and
a
tartar
on
the
shore
of
zea
it
may
be
easily
conceived
that
he
saw
the
ship
depart
with
a
feeling
before
unfelt
it
was
the
first
time
he
was
left
companionless
and
the
scene
around
was
calculated
to
nourish
stern
fancies
even
though
there
was
not
much
of
suffering
to
be
withstood
the
in
the
port
of
zea
i
recollect
distinctly
the
port
itself
is
a
small
gulf
or
as
the
scottish
highlander
would
call
it
a
loch
the
banks
are
rocky
and
forbidding
the
hills
which
rise
to
the
altitude
of
mountains
have
in
a
long
course
of
ages
been
always
inhabited
by
a
civilized
people
their
precipitous
sides
are
formed
into
innumerable
artificial
terraces
the
aspect
of
which
austere
ruinous
and
ancient
produces
on
the
mind
of
the
stranger
a
sense
of
the
presence
of
a
greater
antiquity
than
the
sight
of
monuments
of
mere
labour
and
art
the
town
stands
high
upon
the
mountain
i
counted
on
the
lower
side
of
the
road
which
leads
to
it
of
those
terraces
at
one
place
under
me
and
on
the
opposite
hills
in
several
places
upwards
of
sixty
whether
lord
byron
ascended
to
the
town
is
doubtful
i
have
never
heard
him
mention
that
he
had
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
he
proceeded
at
once
to
athens
by
one
of
the
boats
which
frequent
the
harbour
at
athens
he
met
an
old
the
marquis
of
sligo
with
whom
he
soon
after
travelled
as
far
as
corinth
the
marquis
turning
off
there
for
tripolizza
while
byron
went
forward
to
patras
where
he
had
some
needful
business
to
transact
with
the
consul
he
then
made
the
tour
of
the
morea
in
the
course
of
which
he
visited
the
vizier
velhi
pasha
by
whom
he
was
treated
as
every
other
english
traveller
of
the
time
was
with
great
distinction
and
hospitality
having
occasion
to
go
back
to
patras
he
was
seized
by
the
local
fever
there
and
reduced
to
death
door
on
his
recovery
he
returned
to
athens
where
he
found
the
marquis
with
lady
hester
stanhope
and
mr
bruce
afterward
so
celebrated
for
his
adventures
in
assisting
the
escape
of
the
french
general
lavalette
he
took
possession
of
the
apartments
which
i
had
occupied
in
the
monastery
and
made
them
his
home
during
the
remainder
of
his
residence
in
greece
but
when
i
returned
to
athens
in
october
he
was
not
there
himself
i
found
however
his
valet
fletcher
in
possession
there
is
no
very
clear
account
of
the
manner
in
which
lord
byron
employed
himself
after
his
return
to
athens
but
various
intimations
in
his
correspondence
show
that
during
the
winter
his
pen
was
not
idle
it
would
however
be
to
neglect
an
important
occurrence
not
to
notice
that
during
the
time
when
he
was
at
athens
alone
the
incident
which
he
afterwards
embodied
in
the
impassioned
fragments
of
the
giaour
came
to
pass
and
to
apprise
the
reader
that
the
story
is
founded
on
an
adventure
which
happened
to
himself
he
was
in
fact
the
cause
of
the
girl
being
condemned
and
ordered
to
be
sewn
up
in
a
sack
and
thrown
into
the
sea
one
day
as
he
was
returning
from
bathing
in
the
piraeus
he
met
the
procession
going
down
to
the
shore
to
execute
the
sentence
which
the
waywode
had
pronounced
on
the
girl
and
learning
the
object
of
the
ceremony
and
who
was
the
victim
he
immediately
interfered
with
great
resolution
for
on
observing
some
hesitation
on
the
part
of
the
leader
of
the
escort
to
return
with
him
to
the
governor
house
he
drew
a
pistol
and
threatened
to
shoot
him
on
the
spot
the
man
then
turned
about
and
accompanied
him
back
when
partly
by
bribery
and
entreaty
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
pardon
for
her
on
condition
that
she
was
sent
immediately
out
of
the
city
byron
conveyed
her
to
the
monastery
and
on
the
same
night
sent
her
off
to
thebes
where
she
found
a
safe
asylum
with
this
affair
i
may
close
his
adventures
in
greece
for
although
he
remained
several
months
subsequent
at
athens
he
was
in
a
great
measure
stationary
his
health
which
was
never
robust
was
impaired
by
the
effects
of
the
fever
which
lingered
about
him
perhaps
too
by
the
humiliating
anxiety
he
suffered
on
account
of
the
uncertainty
in
his
remittances
but
however
this
may
have
been
it
was
fortunate
for
his
fame
that
he
returned
to
england
at
the
period
he
did
for
the
climate
of
the
mediterranean
was
detrimental
to
his
constitution
the
heat
oppressed
him
so
much
as
to
be
positive
suffering
and
scarcely
had
he
reached
malta
on
his
way
home

he
was

lord

arrived
in

about

of
july
having
been
absent
a
few
days
more
than
two
years
the
embarrassed
condition
in
which
he
found
his
affairs
sufficiently
explains
the
dejection
and
uneasiness
with
which
he
was
afflicted
during
the
latter
part
of
his
residence
in
greece
and
yet
it
was
not
such
as
ought
to
have
affected
him
so
deeply
nor
have
i
ever
been
able
to
comprehend
wherefore
so
much
stress
has
been
laid
on
his
supposed
friendlessness
in
respect
both
to
it
and
to
his
ravelled
fortune
a
great
deal
too
much
has
been
too
often
said
and
the
manliness
of
his
character
has
suffered
by
the
puling
his
correspondence
shows
that
he
had
several
friends
to
whom
he
was
much
attached
and
his
disposition
justifies
the
belief
that
had
he
not
been
well
persuaded
the
attachment
was
reciprocal
he
would
not
have
remained
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
them
and
though
for
his
rank
not
rich
he
was
still
able
to
maintain
all
its
suitable
exhibition
the
world
could
never
regard
as
an
object
of
compassion
or
of
sympathy
an
english
noble
whose
income
was
enough
to
support
his
dignity
among
his
peers
and
whose
poverty
however
grievous
to
his
pride
caused
only
the
privation
of
extravagance
but
it
can
not
be
controverted
that
there
was
an
innate
predilection
in
the
mind
of
lord
byron
to
mystify
everything
about
himself
he
was
actuated
by
a
passion
to
excite
attention
and
like
every
other
passion
it
was
often
indulged
at
the
expense
of
propriety
he
had
the
infirmity
of
speaking
though
vaguely
and
in
obscure
hints
and
allusions
more
of
his
personal
concerns
than
is
commonly
deemed
consistent
with
a
correct
estimate
of
the
interest
which
mankind
take
in
the
cares
of
one
another
but
he
lived
to
feel
and
to
rue
the
consequences
to
repent
he
could
not
for
the
cause
was
in
the
very
element
of
his
nature
it
was
a
blemish
as
incurable
as
the
deformity
of
his
foot
on
his
arrival
in
london
his
relation
mr
dallas
called
on
him
and
in
the
course
of
their
first
brief
conversation
his
lordship
mentioned
that
he
had
written
a
paraphrase
of
horace
art
of
poetry
but
said
nothing
then
of
childe
harold
a
circumstance
which
leads
me
to
suspect
that
he
offered
him
the
slighter
work
first
to
enjoy
his
surprise
afterward
at
the
greater
if
so
the
result
answered
the
intent
mr
dallas
carried
home
with
him
the
paraphrase
of
horace
with
which
he
was
grievously
disappointed
so
much
so
that
on
meeting
his
lordship
again
in
the
morning
and
being
reluctant
to
speak
of
it
as
he
really
thought
he
only
expressed
some
surprise
that
his
noble
friend
should
have
produced
nothing
else
during
his
long
absence
i
can
easily
conceive
the
emphatic
indifference
if
my
conjecture
be
well
founded
with
which
lord
byron
must
have
said
to
him
i
have
occasionally
written
short
poems
besides
a
great
many
stanzas
in
spenser
measure
relative
to
the
countries
i
have
visited
they
are
not
worth
troubling
you
with
but
you
shall
have
them
all
with
you
if
you
like
childe
harold
pilgrimage
was
accordingly
placed
in
his
hands
mr
dallas
took
it
home
and
was
not
slow
in
discovering
its
beauties
for
in
the
course
of
the
same
evening
he
despatched
a
note
to
his
lordship
as
fair
a
specimen
of
the
style
of
an
elderly
patronising
gentleman
as
can
well
be
imagined
you
have
written
said
he
one
of
the
most
delightful
poems
i
ever
read
if
i
wrote
this
in
flattery
i
should
deserve
your
contempt
rather
than
your
friendship
i
have
been
so
fascinated
with
childe
harold
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
lay
it
down
i
would
almost
pledge
my
life
on
its
advancing
the
reputation
of
your
poetical
powers
and
on
its
gaining
you
great
honour
and
regard
if
you
will
do
me
the
credit
and
favour
of
attending
to
my
suggestions
for
some
reason
or
another
lord
byron
however
felt
or
feigned
great
reluctance
to
publish
childe
harold
possibly
his
repugnance
was
dictated
by
diffidence
not
with
respect
to
its
merits
but
from
a
consciousness
that
the
hero
of
the
poem
exhibited
traits
and
resemblances
of
himself
it
would
indeed
be
injustice
to
his
judgment
and
taste
to
suppose
he
was
not
sensible
of
the
superiority
of
the
terse
and
energetic
poetry
which
brightens
and
burns
in
every
stanza
of
the
pilgrimage
compared
with
the
loose
and
sprawling
lines
and
dull
rhythm
of
the
paraphrase
it
is
true
that
he
alleged
it
had
been
condemned
by
a
good
critic
the
only
one
who
had
previously
seen
it
probably
mr
hobhouse
who
was
with
him
during
the
time
he
was
writing
it
but
still
i
can
not
conceive
he
was
so
blind
to
excellence
as
to
prefer
in
sincerity
the
other
composition
which
was
only
an
imitation
but
the
arguments
of
mr
dallas
prevailed
and
in
due
season
childe
harold
was
prepared
for
the
press
in
the
meantime
while
busily
engaged
in
his
literary
projects
with
mr
dallas
and
in
law
affairs
with
his
agent
he
was
suddenly
summoned
to
newstead
by
the
state
of
his
mother
health
before
he
had
reached
the
abbey
she
had
breathed
her
last
the
event
deeply
affected
him
he
had
not
seen
her
since
his
return
and
a
presentiment
possessed
her
when
they
parted
that
she
was
never
to
see
him
again
notwithstanding
her
violent
temper
and
other
unseemly
conduct
her
affection
for
him
had
been
so
fond
and
dear
that
he
undoubtedly
returned
it
with
unaffected
sincerity
and
from
many
casual
and
incidental
expressions
which
i
have
heard
him
employ
concerning
her
i
am
persuaded
that
his
filial
love
was
not
at
any
time
even
of
an
ordinary
kind
during
her
life
he
might
feel
uneasy
respecting
her
apprehensive
on
account
of
her
ungovernable
passions
and
indiscretions
but
the
manner
in
which
he
lamented
her
death
clearly
proves
that
the
integrity
of
his
affection
had
never
been
impaired
on
the
night
after
his
arrival
at
the
abbey
the
of
mrs
byron
in
passing
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
corpse
lay
heard
the
sound
of
some
one
sighing
heavily
within
and
on
entering
found
his
lordship
sitting
in
the
dark
beside
the
bed
she
remonstrated
with
him
for
so
giving
way
to
grief
when
he
burst
into
tears
and
exclaimed
i
had
but
one
friend
in
the
world
and
she
is
gone
of
the
fervency
of
his
sorrow
i
do
therefore
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
very
endeavour
which
he
made
to
conceal
it
by
indifference
was
a
proof
of
its
depth
and
anguish
though
he
hazarded
the
strictures
of
the
world
by
the
indecorum
of
his
conduct
on
the
occasion
of
the
funeral
having
declined
to
follow
the
remains
himself
he
stood
looking
from
the
hall
door
at
the
procession
till
the
whole
had
moved
away
and
then
turning
to
one
of
the
servants
the
only
person
left
he
desired
him
to
fetch
the
and
proceeded
with
him
to
his
usual
exercise
but
the
scene
was
impressive
and
spoke
eloquently
of
a
grieved
heart
he
sparred
in
silence
all
the
time
and
the
servant
thought
that
he
hit
harder
than
was
his
habit
at
last
he
suddenly
flung
away
the
gloves
and
retired
to
his
own
room
as
soon
as
the
funeral
was
over
the
publication
of
childe
harold
was
resumed
but
it
went
slowly
through
the
press
in
the
meantime
an
incident
occurred
to
him
which
deserves
to
be
noted
because
it
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
in
his
life
and
has
given
rise
to
consequences
affecting
his
fame
with
advantage
in
english
bards
and
scotch
reviewers
he
had
alluded
with
provoking
pleasantry
to
a
meeting
which
had
taken
place
at
chalk
farm
some
years
before
between
mr
jeffrey
the
edinburgh
reviewer
and
mr
moore
without
recollecting
indeed
without
having
heard
that
mr
moore
had
explained
through
the
newspapers
what
was
alleged
to
have
been
ridiculous
in
the
affair
this
revival
of
the
subject
especially
as
it
called
in
question
the
truth
of
mr
statement
obliged
that
gentleman
to
demand
an
explanation
but
lord
byron
being
abroad
did
not
receive
this
letter
and
of
course
knew
not
of
its
contents
so
that
on
his
return
mr
moore
was
induced
to
address
his
lordship
again
the
correspondence
which
ensued
is
honourable
to
the
spirit
and
feelings
of
both
mr
moore
after
referring
to
his
first
letter
restated
the
nature
of
the
insult
which
the
passage
in
the
note
to
the
poem
was
calculated
to
convey
adding
it
is
now
useless
to
speak
of
the
steps
with
which
it
was
my
intention
to
follow
up
that
letter
the
time
which
has
elapsed
since
then
though
it
has
done
away
neither
the
injury
nor
the
feeling
of
it
has
in
many
respects
materially
altered
my
situation
and
the
only
object
i
have
now
in
writing
to
your
lordship
is
to
preserve
some
consistency
with
that
former
letter
and
to
prove
to
you
that
the
injured
feeling
still
exists
however
circumstances
may
compel
me
to
be
deaf
to
its
dictates
at
present
when
i
say
feeling
let
me
assure
your
lordship
that
there
is
not
a
single
vindictive
sentiment
in
my
mind
towards
you
i
mean
but
to
express
that
uneasiness
under
what
i
consider
to
be
a
charge
of
falsehood
which
must
haunt
a
man
of
any
feeling
to
his
grave
unless
the
insult
be
retracted
or
atoned
for
and
which
if
i
did
not
feel
i
should
indeed
deserve
far
worse
than
your
satire
could
inflict
upon
me
and
he
concluded
by
saying
that
so
far
from
being
influenced
by
any
angry
or
resentful
feeling
it
would
give
him
sincere
pleasure
if
by
any
satisfactory
explanation
his
lordship
would
enable
him
to
seek
the
honour
of
being
ranked
among
his
acquaintance
the
answer
of
lord
byron
was
diplomatic
but
manly
he
declared
that
he
never
received
mr
moore
letter
and
assured
him
that
in
whatever
part
of
the
world
it
had
reached
him
he
would
have
deemed
it
his
duty
to
return
and
answer
it
in
person
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
advertisement
to
which
mr
moore
had
alluded
and
consequently
could
not
have
had
the
slightest
idea
of
giving
the
lie
to
an
address
which
he
had
never
seen
when
i
put
my
name
to
the
production
said
his
lordship
which
has
occasioned
this
correspondence
i
became
responsible
to
all
whom
it
might
concern
to
explain
where
it
requires
explanation
and
where
insufficiently
or
too
sufficiently
explicit
at
all
events
to
satisfy
my
situation
leaves
me
no
choice
it
rests
with
the
injured
and
the
angry
to
obtain
reparation
in
their
own
way
with
regard
to
the
passage
in
question
you
were
certainly
not
the
person
towards
whom
i
felt
personally
hostile
on
the
contrary
my
whole
thoughts
were
engrossed
by
one
whom
i
had
reason
to
consider
as
my
worst
literary
enemy
nor
could
i
foresee
that
his
former
antagonist
was
about
to
become
his
champion
you
do
not
specify
what
you
would
wish
to
have
done
i
can
neither
retract
nor
apologize
for
a
charge
of
falsehood
which
i
never
advanced
in
reply
mr
moore
commenced
by
acknowledging
that
his
letter
was
upon
the
whole
as
satisfactory
as
he
could
expect
and
after
alluding
to
specific
circumstances
in
the
case
concluded
thus
as
your
lordship
does
not
show
any
wish
to
proceed
beyond
the
rigid
formulary
of
explanation
it
is
not
for
me
to
make
any
farther
advances
we
irishmen
in
business
of
this
kind
seldom
know
any
medium
between
decided
hostility
and
decided
friendship
but
as
any
approaches
towards
the
latter
alternative
must
now
depend
entirely
on
your
lordship
i
have
only
to
repeat
that
i
am
satisfied
with
your
letter
here
the
correspondence
would
probably
with
most
people
have
been
closed
but
lord
byron
sensibility
was
interested
and
would
not
let
it
rest
accordingly
on
the
following
day
he
rejoined
soon
after
my
return
to
england
my
friend
mr
hodgson
apprised
me
that
a
letter
for
me
was
in
his
possession
but
a
domestic
event
hurrying
me
from
london
immediately
after
the
letter
which
may
most
probably
be
your
own
is
still
unopened
in
his
keeping
if
on
examination
of
the
address
the
similarity
of
the
handwriting
should
lead
to
such
a
conclusion
it
shall
be
opened
in
your
presence
for
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
mr
is
at
present
out
of
town
on
friday
i
shall
see
him
and
request
him
to
forward
it
to
my
address
with
regard
to
the
latter
part
of
both
your
letters
until
the
principal
point
was
discussed
between
us
i
felt
myself
at
a
loss
in
what
manner
to
reply
was
i
to
anticipate
friendship
from
one
who
conceived
me
to
have
charged
him
with
falsehood
were
not
advances
under
such
circumstances
to
be
misconstrued
not
perhaps
by
the
person
to
whom
they
were
addressed
but
by
others
in
my
case
such
a
step
was
impracticable
if
you
who
conceived
yourself
to
be
the
offended
person
are
satisfied
that
you
had
no
cause
for
offence
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
convince
me
of
it
my
situation
as
i
have
before
stated
leaves
me
no
choice
i
should
have
felt
proud
of
your
acquaintance
had
it
commenced
under
other
circumstances
but
it
must
rest
with
you
to
determine
how
far
it
may
proceed
after
so
auspicious
a
beginning
mr
moore
acknowledges
that
he
was
somewhat
piqued
at
the
manner
in
which
his
efforts
towards
a
more
friendly
understanding
were
received
and
hastened
to
close
the
correspondence
by
a
short
note
saying
that
his
lordship
had
made
him
feel
the
imprudence
he
was
guilty
of
in
wandering
from
the
point
immediately
in
discussion
between
them
this
drew
immediately
from
lord
byron
the
following
frank
and
openhearted
reply
you
must
excuse
my
troubling
you
once
more
upon
this
very
unpleasant
subject
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
and
i
should
think
to
yourself
that
the
unopened
letter
in
mr
hodgson
possession
supposing
it
to
prove
your
own
should
be
returned
in
statu
quo
to
the
writer
particularly
as
you
expressed
yourself
quite
easy
under
the
manner
in
which
i
had
dwelt
on
its
miscarriage
a
few
words
more
and
i
shall
not
trouble
you
further
i
felt
and
still
feel
very
much
flattered
by
those
parts
of
your
correspondence
which
held
out
the
prospect
of
our
becoming
acquainted
if
i
did
not
meet
them
in
the
first
instance
as
perhaps
i
ought
let
the
situation
in
which
i
was
placed
be
my
defence
you
have
now
declared
yourself
satisfied
and
on
that
point
we
are
no
longer
at
issue
if
therefore
you
still
retain
any
wish
to
do
me
the
honour
you
hinted
at
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
meet
you
when
where
and
how
you
please
and
i
presume
you
will
not
attribute
my
saying
thus
much
to
any
unworthy
motive
the
result
was
a
dinner
at
the
house
of
mr
rogers
the
amiable
and
celebrated
author
of
the
pleasures
of
memory
and
the
only
guest
besides
the
two
adversaries
was
mr
campbell
author
of
the
pleasures
of
hope
a
poetical
group
of
four
not
easily
to
be
matched
among
contemporaries
in
any
age
or
country
the
meeting
could
not
but
be
interesting
and
mr
moore
has
described
the
effect
it
had
on
himself
with
a
felicitous
warmth
which
showed
how
much
he
enjoyed
the
party
and
was
pleased
with
the
friendship
that
ensued
among
the
impressions
says
he
which
this
meeting
left
on
me
what
i
chiefly
remember
to
have
remarked
was
the
nobleness
of
his
air
his
beauty
the
gentleness
of
his
voice
and
manners
and
what
was
naturally
not
the
least
attraction
his
marked
kindness
for
myself
being
in
mourning
for
his
mother
the
colour
as
well
of
his
dress
as
of
his
glossy
curling
and
picturesque
hair
gave
more
effect
to
the
pure
spiritual
paleness
of
his
features
in
the
expression
of
which
when
he
spoke
there
was
a
perpetual
play
of
lively
thought
though
melancholy
was
their
habitual
character
when
in
repose
chapter
xxvi
the
libel
in
the
scourge
the
general
impression
of
his
character
improvement
in
his
manners
as
his
merit
was
acknowledgement
by
the
public
his
address
in
management
his
first
speech
in
parliament
the
publication
of
childe
harold
its
reception
and
effect
during
the
first
winter
after
lord
byron
had
returned
to
england
i
was
frequently
with
him
childe
harold
was
not
then
published
and
although
the
impression
of
his
satire
english
bards
and
scotch
reviewers
was
still
strong
upon
the
public
he
could
not
well
be
said
to
have
been
then
a
celebrated
character
at
that
time
the
strongest
feeling
by
which
he
appeared
to
be
actuated
was
indignation
against
a
writer
in
a
scurrilous
publication
called
the
scourge
in
which
he
was
not
only
treated
with
unjustifiable
malignity
but
charged
with
being
as
he
told
me
himself
the
illegitimate
son
of
a
murderer
i
had
not
read
the
work
but
the
writer
who
could
make
such
an
absurd
accusation
must
have
been
strangely
ignorant
of
the
very
circumstances
from
which
he
derived
the
materials
of
his
own
libel
when
lord
byron
mentioned
the
subject
to
me
and
that
he
was
consulting
sir
vickery
gibbs
with
the
intention
of
prosecuting
the
publisher
and
the
author
i
advised
him
as
well
as
i
could
to
desist
simply
because
the
allegation
referred
to
occurrences
his
duel
with
chaworth
and
the
order
of
the
house
of
peers
to
produce
evidence
of
his
marriage
with
miss
trevannion
the
facts
of
which
being
matter
of
history
and
public
record
superseded
the
necessity
of
any
proceeding
knowing
how
deeply
this
affair
agitated
him
at
that
time
i
was
not
surprised
at
the
sequestration
in
which
he
held
himself
and
which
made
those
who
were
not
acquainted
with
his
shy
and
mystical
nature
apply
to
him
the
description
of
his
own
lara
the
chief
of
lara
is
return
again
and
why
had
lara
cross
the
bounding
main
left
by
his
sire
too
young
such
loss
to
know
lord
of
himself
that
heritage
of
woe
in
him
inexplicably
mix
much
to
be
loved
and
hated
sought
and
fear
opinion
varying
his
hidden
lot
in
praise
or
railing
his
name
forgot
his
silence
form
a
theme
for
others
prate
they
guess
they
gazed
they
fain
would
know
his
fate
what
had
he
been
what
was
he
thus
unknown
who
walk
their
world
his
lineage
only
known
a
hater
of
his
kind
yet
some
would
say
with
them
he
could
seem
gay
amid
the
gay
but
own
that
smile
if
oft
observed
and
near
waned
in
its
mirth
and
wither
to
a
sneer
that
smile
might
reach
his
lip
but
pass
not
by
none
could
trace
its
laughter
to
his
eye
yet
there
was
softness
too
in
his
regard
at
times
a
heart
is
not
by
nature
hard
but
once
perceived
his
spirit
seem
to
hide
such
weakness
as
unworthy
of
its
pride
and
stretch
itself
as
scorning
to
redeem
one
doubt
from
others
esteem
in
penance
of
a
breast
which
tenderness
might
once
have
wrung
from
rest
in
vigilance
of
grief
that
would
compel
the
soul
to
hate
for
having
loved
too
well
there
was
in
him
a
vital
scorn
of
all
as
if
the
worst
had
which
could
befall
he
stood
a
stranger
in
this
breathing
world
an
erring
spirit
from
another
hurl
a
thing
of
dark
imaginings
that
shaped
by
choice
the
perils
he
by
chance
escaped
such
was
byron
to
common
observance
on
his
return
i
recollect
one
night
meeting
him
at
the
opera
seeing
me
with
a
gentleman
whom
he
did
not
know
and
to
whom
he
was
unknown
he
addressed
me
in
italian
and
we
continued
to
converse
for
some
time
in
that
language
my
friend
who
in
the
meanwhile
had
been
observing
him
with
curiosity
conceiving
him
to
be
a
foreigner
inquired
in
the
course
of
the
evening
who
he
was
remarking
that
he
had
never
seen
a
man
with
such
a
mark
on
the
forehead
before
alluding
to
that
singular
scowl
which
struck
me
so
forcibly
when
i
first
saw
him
and
which
appears
to
have
made
a
stronger
impression
upon
me
than
it
did
upon
many
others
i
never
in
fact
could
overcome
entirely
the
prejudice
of
the
first
impression
although
i
ought
to
have
been
gratified
by
the
friendship
and
confidence
with
which
he
always
appeared
disposed
to
treat
me
when
childe
harold
was
printed
he
sent
me
a
quarto
copy
before
the
publication
a
favour
and
distinction
i
have
always
prized
and
the
copy
which
he
gave
me
of
the
bride
of
abydos
was
one
he
had
prepared
for
a
new
edition
and
which
contains
in
his
own
writing
these
six
lines
in
no
other
copy
bless
as
the
muezzin
strain
from
mecca
wall
to
pilgrims
pure
and
prostrate
at
his
call
soft
as
the
melody
of
youthful
days
that
steals
the
trembling
tear
of
speechless
praise
sweet
as
his
native
song
to
exile
ears
shall
sound
each
tone
thy
voice
endears
he
had
not
it
is
true
at
the
period
of
which
i
am
speaking
gathered
much
of
his
fame
but
the
gale
was
rising
and
though
the
vessel
was
evidently
yielding
to
the
breeze
she
was
neither
crank
nor
unsteady
on
the
contrary
the
more
he
became
an
object
of
public
interest
the
less
did
he
indulge
his
capricious
humour
about
the
time
when
the
bride
of
abydos
was
published
he
appeared
disposed
to
settle
into
a
consistent
character
especially
after
the
first
sale
of
newstead
before
that
particular
event
he
was
often
so
disturbed
in
his
mind
that
he
could
not
conceal
his
unhappiness
and
frequently
spoke
of
leaving
england
for
ever
although
few
men
were
more
under
the
impulses
of
passion
than
lord
byron
there
was
yet
a
curious
kind
of
management
about
him
which
showed
that
he
was
well
aware
how
much
of
the
world
favour
was
to
be
won
by
it
long
before
childe
harold
appeared
it
was
generally
known
that
he
had
a
poem
in
the
press
and
various
surmises
to
stimulate
curiosity
were
circulated
concerning
it
i
do
not
say
that
these
were
by
his
orders
or
under
his
directions
but
on
one
occasion
i
did
fancy
that
i
could
discern
a
touch
of
his
own
hand
in
a
paragraph
in
the
morning
post
in
which
he
was
mentioned
as
having
returned
from
an
excursion
into
the
interior
of
africa
and
when
i
alluded
to
it
my
suspicion
was
confirmed
by
his
embarrassment
i
mention
this
incident
not
in
the
spirit
of
detraction
for
in
the
paragraph
there
was
nothing
of
puff
though
certainly
something
of
oddity
but
as
a
tint
of
character
indicative
of
the
appetite
for
distinction
by
which
about
this
period
he
became
so
powerfully
incited
that
at
last
it
grew
into
a
diseased
crave
and
to
such
a
degree
that
were
the
figure
allowable
it
might
be
said
the
mouth
being
incapable
of
supplying
adequate
means
to
appease
it
every
pore
became
another
mouth
greedy
of
nourishment
i
am
however
hastening
on
too
fast
lord
byron
was
at
that
time
far
indeed
from
being
ruled
by
any
such
inordinate
passion
the
fears
the
timidity
and
bashfulness
of
young
desire
still
clung
to
him
and
he
was
throbbing
with
doubt
if
he
should
be
found
worthy
of
the
high
prize
for
which
he
was
about
to
offer
himself
a
candidate
the
course
he
adopted
on
the
occasion
whether
dictated
by
management
or
the
effect
of
accident
was
however
well
calculated
to
attract
attention
to
his
debut
as
a
public
man
when
childe
harold
was
ready
for
publication
he
determined
to
make
his
first
appearance
as
an
orator
in
the
house
of
lords
the
occasion
was
judiciously
chosen
being
a
debate
on
the
nottingham
bill
a
subject
on
which
it
was
natural
to
suppose
he
possessed
some
local
knowledge
that
might
bear
upon
a
question
directed
so
exclusively
against
transactions
in
his
own
county
he
prepared
himself
as
the
best
orators
do
in
their
first
essays
not
only
by
composing
but
writing
down
the
whole
of
his
speech
beforehand
the
reception
he
met
with
was
flattering
he
was
complimented
warmly
by
some
of
the
speakers
on
his
own
side
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
his
debut
was
more
showy
than
promising
it
lacked
weight
in
metal
as
was
observed
at
the
time
and
the
mode
of
delivery
was
more
like
a
schoolboy
recital
than
a
masculine
grapple
with
an
argument
it
was
moreover
full
of
rhetorical
exaggerations
and
disfigured
with
conceits
still
it
scintillated
with
talent
and
justified
the
opinion
that
he
was
an
extraordinary
young
man
probably
destined
to
distinction
though
he
might
not
be
a
statesman
mr
dallas
gives
a
lively
account
of
his
elation
on
the
occasion
when
he
left
the
great
chamber
says
that
gentleman
i
went
and
met
him
in
the
passage
he
was
glowing
with
success
and
much
agitated
i
had
an
umbrella
in
my
right
hand
not
expecting
that
he
would
put
out
his
hand
to
me
in
my
haste
to
take
it
when
offered
i
had
advanced
my
left
hand
said
he
your
friend
your
left
hand
upon
such
an
occasion
i
showed
the
cause
and
immediately
changing
the
umbrella
to
the
other
i
gave
him
my
right
hand
which
he
shook
and
pressed
warmly
he
was
greatly
elated
and
repeated
some
of
the
compliments
which
had
been
paid
him
and
mentioned
one
or
two
of
the
peers
who
had
desired
to
be
introduced
to
him
he
concluded
by
saying
that
he
had
by
his
speech
given
me
the
best
advertisement
for
childe
harold
pilgrimage
it
is
upon
this
latter
circumstance
that
i
have
ventured
to
state
my
suspicion
that
there
was
a
degree
of
worldly
management
in
making
his
first
appearance
in
the
house
of
lords
so
immediately
preceding
the
publication
of
his
poem
the
speech
was
indeed
a
splendid
advertisement
but
the
greater
and
brighter
merits
of
the
poem
soon
proved
that
it
was
not
requisite
for
the
speech
made
no
impression
but
the
poem
was
at
once
hailed
with
delight
and
admiration
it
filled
a
vacancy
in
the
public
mind
which
the
excitement
and
inflation
arising
from
the
mighty
events
of
the
age
had
created
the
world
in
its
condition
and
circumstances
was
prepared
to
receive
a
work
so
original
vigorous
and
beautiful
and
the
reception
was
such
that
there
was
no
undue
extravagance
in
the
noble
author
saying
in
his
memorandum
i
awoke
one
morning
and
found
myself
famous
but
he
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
revel
in
such
triumphant
success
with
impunity
if
the
great
spirits
of
the
time
were
smitten
with
astonishment
at
the
splendour
of
the
rising
fire
the
imps
and
elves
of
malignity
and
malice
fluttered
their
in
all
directions
those
whom
the
poet
had
afflicted
in
his
satire
and
who
had
remained
quietly
crouching
with
lacerated
shoulders
in
the
hope
that
their
flagellation
would
be
forgotten
and
that
the
avenging
demon
who
had
so
punished
their
imbecility
would
pass
away
were
terrified
from
their
obscurity
they
came
like
moths
to
the
candle
and
sarcasms
in
the
satire
which
had
long
been
unheeded
in
the
belief
that
they
would
soon
be
forgotten
were
felt
to
have
been
barbed
with
irremediable
venom
when
they
beheld
the
avenger
towering
in
his
pride
of
place

our

continued
kindness
towards
me
instance
of
it
to
one
of
my
friends
for
some
time
after
the
publication
of
childe
harold
the
noble
author
appeared
to
more
advantage
than
i
ever
afterwards
saw
him
he
was
soothed
by
success
and
the
universal
applause
which
attended
his
poem
seemed
to
make
him
think
more
kindly
of
the
world
of
which
he
has
too
often
complained
while
it
would
be
difficult
to
discover
in
his
career
and
fortunes
that
he
had
ever
received
any
cause
from
it
to
justify
his
complaint
at
no
time
i
imagine
could
it
be
said
that
lord
byron
was
one
of
those
men
who
interest
themselves
in
the
concerns
of
others
he
had
always
too
much
to
do
with
his
own
thoughts
about
himself
to
afford
time
for
the
consideration
of
aught
that
was
lower
in
his
affections
but
still
he
had
many
amiable
fits
and
at
the
particular
period
to
which
i
allude
he
evinced
a
constancy
in
the
disposition
to
oblige
which
proved
how
little
was
wanting
to
have
made
him
as
pleasant
as
he
was
uniformly
interesting
i
felt
this
towards
myself
in
a
matter
which
had
certainly
the
grace
of
condescension
in
it
at
the
expense
of
some
trouble
to
him
i
then
lived
at
the
corner
of
bridge
street
westminster
and
in
going
to
the
house
of
lords
he
frequently
stopped
to
inquire
if
i
wanted
a
frank
his
conversation
at
the
same
time
was
of
a
milder
vein
and
with
the
single
exception
of
one
day
while
dining
together
at
the
st
alban
it
was
light
and
playful
as
if
gaiety
had
become
its
habitude
perhaps
i
regarded
him
too
curiously
and
more
than
once
it
struck
me
that
he
thought
so
for
at
times
when
he
was
in
his
comfortless
moods
he
has
talked
of
his
affairs
and
perplexities
as
if
i
had
been
much
more
acquainted
with
them
than
i
had
any
opportunity
of
being
but
he
was
a
subject
for
study
such
as
is
rarely
met
with
at
least
he
was
so
to
me
for
his
weaknesses
were
as
interesting
as
his
talents
and
he
often
indulged
in
expressions
which
would
have
been
blemishes
in
the
reflections
of
other
men
but
which
in
him
often
proved
the
germs
of
philosophical
imaginings
he
was
the
least
qualified
for
any
sort
of
business
of
all
men
i
have
ever
known
so
skinless
in
sensibility
as
respected
himself
and
so
distrustful
in
his
universal
apprehensions
of
human
nature
as
respected
others
it
was
indeed
a
wild
though
a
beautiful
error
of
nature
to
endow
a
spirit
with
such
discerning
faculties
and
yet
render
it
unfit
to
deal
with
mankind
but
these
reflections
belong
more
properly
to
a
general
estimate
of
his
character
than
to
the
immediate
purpose
before
me
which
was
principally
to
describe
the
happy
effects
which
the
splendid
reception
of
childe
harold
had
on
his
feelings
effects
which
however
did
not
last
long
he
was
gratified
to
the
fullness
of
his
hopes
but
the
adulation
was
enjoyed
to
excess
and
his
infirmities
were
aggravated
by
the
surfeit
i
did
not
however
see
the
progress
of
the
change
as
in
the
course
of
the
summer
i
went
to
scotland
and
soon
after
again
abroad
but
on
my
return
in
the
following
spring
it
was
very
obvious
i
found
him
in
one
respect
greatly
improved
there
was
more
of
a
formed
character
about
him
he
was
evidently
at
the
first
glance
more
mannered
or
endeavouring
to
be
so
and
easier
with
the
proprieties
of
his
rank
but
he
had
risen
in
his
own
estimation
above
the
honours
so
willingly
paid
to
his
genius
and
was
again
longing
for
additional
renown
not
content
with
being
acknowledged
as
the
first
poet
of
the
age
and
a
respectable
orator
in
the
house
of
lords
he
was
aspiring
to
the
eclat
of
a
man
of
gallantry
so
that
many
of
the
most
ungracious
peculiarities
of
his
temper
though
brought
under
better
discipline
were
again
in
full
activity
considering
how
much
he
was
then
caressed
i
ought
to
have
been
proud
of
the
warmth
with
which
he
received
me
i
did
not
however
so
often
see
him
as
in
the
previous
year
for
i
was
then
on
the
eve
of
my
marriage
and
i
should
not
so
soon
after
my
return
to
london
have
probably
renewed
my
visits
but
a
foreign
nobleman
of
the
highest
rank
who
had
done
me
the
honour
to
treat
me
as
a
friend
came
at
that
juncture
to
this
country
and
knowing
i
had
been
acquainted
with
lord
byron
he
requested
me
to
introduce
him
to
his
lordship
this
rendered
a
visit
preliminary
to
the
introduction
necessary
and
so
long
as
my
distinguished
friend
remained
in
town
we
again
often
met
but
after
he
left
the
country
my
visits
became
few
and
far
between
owing
to
nothing
but
that
change
in
a
pursuits
and
associates
which
is
one
among
some
of
the
evils
of
matrimony
it
is
somewhat
remarkable
that
of
the
last
visit
i
ever
paid
him
he
has
made
rather
a
particular
memorandum
i
remember
well
that
it
was
in
many
respects
an
occasion
not
to
be
at
once
forgotten
for
among
other
things
after
lighter
topics
he
explained
to
me
a
variety
of
tribulations
in
his
affairs
and
i
urged
him
in
consequence
to
marry
with
the
frankness
which
his
confidence
encouraged
subjoining
certain
items
of
other
good
advice
concerning
a
liaison
which
he
was
supposed
to
have
formed
and
which
mr
moore
does
not
appear
to
have
known
though
it
was
much
talked
of
at
the
time
during
that
visit
the
youthful
peculiarities
of
his
temper
and
character
showed
all
their
original
blemish
but
as
usual
when
such
was
the
case
he
was
often
more
interesting
than
when
in
his
discreeter
moods
he
gave
me
the
copy
of
the
bride
of
abydos
with
a
very
kind
inscription
on
it
which
i
have
already
mentioned
but
still
there
was
an
impression
on
my
mind
that
led
me
to
believe
he
could
not
have
been
very
well
pleased
with
some
parts
of
my
counselling
this
however
appears
not
to
have
been
the
case
on
the
contrary
the
tone
of
his
record
breathes
something
of
kindness
and
long
after
i
received
different
reasons
to
believe
his
recollection
of
me
was
warm
and
friendly
when
he
had
retired
to
genoa
i
gave
a
gentleman
a
letter
to
him
partly
that
i
might
hear
something
of
his
real
way
of
life
and
partly
in
the
hope
of
gratifying
my
friend
by
the
sight
of
one
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
the
reception
from
his
lordship
was
flattering
to
me
and
as
the
account
of
it
contains
what
i
think
a
characteristic
picture
the
reader
will
i
doubt
not
be
pleased
to
see
so
much
of
it
as
may
be
made
public
without
violating
the
decorum
which
should
always
be
observed
in
describing
the
incidents
of
private
intercourse
when
the
consent
of
all
parties
can
not
be
obtained
to
the
publication
edinburgh
june
dear
galt
though
i
shall
always
retain
a
lively
general
recollection
of
my
agreeable
interview
with
lord
byron
at
genoa
in
may
so
long
a
time
has
since
elapsed
that
much
of
the
aroma
of
the
pleasure
has
evaporated
and
i
can
but
recall
generalities
at
that
time
there
was
an
impression
in
genoa
that
he
was
averse
to
receive
visits
from
englishmen
and
i
was
indeed
advised
not
to
think
of
calling
on
him
as
i
might
run
the
risk
of
meeting
with
a
savage
reception
however
i
resolved
to
send
your
note
and
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
the
messenger
brought
a
most
polite
answer
in
which
after
expressing
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
of
his
old
friend
and
he
added
that
he
would
do
himself
the
honour
of
calling
on
me
the
next
day
which
he
accordingly
did
but
owing
to
the
officious
blundering
of
an
italian
waiter
who
mentioned
i
was
at
dinner
his
lordship
sent
up
his
card
with
his
compliments
that
he
would
not
deranger
the
party
i
was
determined
however
that
he
should
not
escape
me
in
this
way
and
drove
out
to
his
residence
next
morning
when
upon
his
english
valet
taking
up
my
name
i
was
immediately
admitted
as
every
one
forms
a
picture
to
himself
of
remarkable
characters
i
had
depicted
his
lordship
in
my
mind
as
a
tall
sombre
childe
harold
personage
tinctured
somewhat
with
aristocratic
hauteur
you
may
therefore
guess
my
surprise
when
the
door
opened
and
i
saw
leaning
upon
the
lock
a
light
animated
figure
rather
petite
than
otherwise
dressed
in
a
nankeen
jacket
trousers
of
the
same
material
with
a
white
waistcoat
his
countenance
pale
but
the
complexion
clear
and
healthful
with
the
hair
coming
down
in
little
curls
on
each
side
of
his
fine
forehead
he
came
towards
me
with
an
easy
cheerfulness
of
manner
and
after
some
preliminary
inquiries
concerning
yourself
we
entered
into
a
conversation
which
lasted
two
hours
in
the
course
of
which
i
felt
myself
perfectly
at
ease
from
his
lordship
natural
and
simple
manners
indeed
so
much
so
that
forgetting
all
my
anticipations
i
found
myself
conversing
with
him
with
as
fluent
an
intercourse
of
mind
as
i
ever
experienced
even
with
yourself
it
is
impossible
for
me
at
present
to
overtake
a
detail
of
what
passed
but
as
it
produced
a
kind
of
scene
i
may
mention
one
incident
having
remarked
that
in
a
long
course
of
desultory
reading
i
had
read
most
of
what
had
been
said
by
english
travellers
concerning
italy
yet
on
coming
to
it
i
found
there
was
no
country
of
which
i
had
less
accurate
notions
that
among
other
things
i
was
much
struck
with
the
harshness
of
the
language
he
seemed
to
jerk
at
this
and
immediately
observed
that
perhaps
in
going
rapidly
through
the
country
i
might
not
have
had
many
opportunities
of
hearing
it
politely
spoken
said
he
are
supposed
to
be
nineteen
dialects
of
the
italian
language
and
i
shall
let
you
hear
a
lady
speak
the
principal
of
them
who
is
considered
to
do
it
very
well
i
pricked
up
my
ears
at
hearing
this
as
i
considered
it
would
afford
me
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
countess
guiccioli
his
lordship
immediately
rose
and
left
the
apartment
returning
in
the
course
of
a
minute
or
two
leading
in
the
lady
and
while
arranging
chairs
for
the
trio
he
said
to
me
shall
make
her
speak
each
of
the
principal
dialects
but
you
are
not
to
mind
how
i
pronounce
for
i
do
not
speak
italian
well
after
the
scene
had
been
performed
he
resumed
to
me
what
do
you
think
to
which
i
answered
that
my
opinion
still
remained
unaltered
he
seemed
at
this
to
fall
into
a
little
revery
and
then
said
abruptly
is
very
odd
moore
thought
the
same
your
lordship
mean
tom
moore
then
my
lord
i
shall
adhere
with
more
pertinacity
to
my
opinion
when
i
hear
that
a
man
of
his
exquisite
taste
in
poetry
and
harmony
was
also
of
that
opinion
you
will
be
asking
what
i
thought
of
the
lady
i
had
certainly
heard
much
of
her
high
personal
attractions
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
in
my
eyes
her
graces
did
not
rank
above
mediocrity
they
were
youth
plumpness
and

xxviii
a
miff
with
lord
byron
remarkable
coincidences
plagiarisms
of
his
lordship
there
is
a
curious
note
in
the
memoranda
which
lord
byron
kept
in
the
year
that
i
should
not
pass
unnoticed
because
it
refers
to
myself
and
moreover
is
characteristic
of
the
excoriated
sensibility
with
which
his
lordship
felt
everything
that
touched
or
affected
him
or
his
when
i
had
read
the
bride
of
abydos
i
wrote
to
him
my
opinion
of
it
and
mentioned
that
there
was
a
remarkable
coincidence
in
the
story
with
a
matter
in
which
i
had
been
interested
i
have
no
copy
of
the
letter
and
i
forget
the
expressions
employed
but
lord
byron
seemed
to
think
they
implied
that
he
had
taken
the
story
from
something
of
mine
the
note
is
galt
says
there
is
a
coincidence
between
the
first
part
of
the
bride
and
some
story
of
his
whether
published
or
not
i
know
not
never
having
seen
it
he
is
almost
the
last
person
on
whom
any
one
would
commit
literary
larceny
and
i
am
not
conscious
of
any
witting
thefts
on
any
of
the
genus
as
to
originality
all
pretensions
are
ludicrous
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
it
is
sufficiently
clear
that
he
was
offended
with
what
i
had
said
and
was
somewhat
excited
i
have
not
been
able
at
present
to
find
his
answer
to
my
letter
but
it
would
appear
by
the
subjoined
that
he
had
written
to
me
something
which
led
me
to
imagine
he
was
offended
at
my
observations
and
that
i
had
in
consequence
deprecated
his
wrath
my
dear
galt
there
was
no
offence
there
could
be
none
i
thought
it
by
no
means
impossible
that
we
might
have
hit
on
something
similar
particularly
as
you
are
a
dramatist
and
was
anxious
to
assure
you
of
the
truth
viz
that
i
had
not
wittingly
seized
upon
plot
sentiment
or
incident
and
i
am
very
glad
that
i
have
not
in
any
respect
trenched
upon
your
subjects
something
still
more
singular
is
that
the
first
part
where
you
have
found
a
coincidence
in
some
events
within
your
observations
on
life
was
drawn
from
observation
of
mine
also
and
i
meant
to
have
gone
on
with
the
story
but
on
second
thoughts
i
thought
myself
two
centuries
at
least
too
late
for
the
subject
which
though
admitting
of
very
powerful
feeling
and
description
yet
is
not
adapted
for
this
age
at
least
this
country
though
the
finest
works
of
the
greeks
one
of
schiller
and
alfieri
in
modern
times
besides
several
of
our
old
and
best
dramatists
have
been
grounded
on
incidents
of
a
similar
cast
i
therefore
altered
it
as
you
perceive
and
in
so
doing
have
weakened
the
whole
by
interrupting
the
train
of
thought
and
in
composition
i
do
not
think
second
thoughts
are
the
best
though
second
expressions
may
improve
the
first
ideas
i
do
not
know
how
other
men
feel
towards
those
they
have
met
abroad
but
to
me
there
seems
a
kind
of
tie
established
between
all
who
have
met
together
in
a
foreign
country
as
if
we
had
met
in
a
state
of
and
were
talking
over
a
life
that
has
ceased
but
i
always
look
forward
to
renewing
my
travels
and
though
you
i
think
are
now
stationary
if
i
can
at
all
forward
your
pursuits
there
as
well
as
here
i
shall
be
truly
glad
in
the
opportunity
ever
yours
very
sincerely
b
i
believe
i
leave
town
for
a
day
or
two
on
monday
but
after
that
i
am
always
at
home
and
happy
to
see
you

this

the

december
on
sunday
the
he
made
the
following
other
note
in
his
memorandum
book
by
galt
answer
i
find
it
is
some
story
in
real
life
and
not
any
work
with
which
my
late
composition
coincides
it
is
still
more
singular
for
mine
is
drawn
from
existence
also
the
most
amusing
part
of
this
little
fracas
is
the
denial
of
his
lordship
as
to
pilfering
the
thoughts
and
fancies
of
others
for
it
so
happens
that
the
first
passage
of
the
bride
of
abydos
the
poem
in
question
is
almost
a
literal
and
unacknowledged
translation
from
goethe
which
was
pointed
out
in
some
of
the
periodicals
soon
after
the
work
was
published
then
as
to
his
not
thieving
from
me
or
mine
i
believe
the
fact
to
be
as
he
has
stated
but
there
are
singular
circumstances
connected
with
some
of
his
other
productions
of
which
the
account
is
at
least
curious
on
leaving
england
i
began
to
write
a
poem
in
the
spenserian
measure
it
was
called
the
unknown
and
was
intended
to
describe
in
narrating
the
voyages
and
adventures
of
a
pilgrim
who
had
embarked
for
the
holy
land
the
scenes
i
expected
to
visit
i
was
occasionally
engaged
in
this
composition
during
the
passage
with
lord
byron
from
gibraltar
to
malta
and
he
knew
what
i
was
about
in
stating
this
i
beg
to
be
distinctly
understood
as
in
no
way
whatever
intending
to
insinuate
that
this
work
had
any
influence
on
the
composition
of
childe
harold
pilgrimage
which
lord
byron
began
to
write
in
albania
but
it
must
be
considered
as
something
extraordinary
that
the
two
works
should
have
been
so
similar
in
plan
and
in
the
structure
of
the
verse
his
lordship
never
saw
my
attempt
that
i
know
of
nor
did
i
his
poem
until
it
was
printed
it
is
needless
to
add
that
beyond
the
plan
and
verse
there
was
no
other
similarity
between
the
two
works
i
wish
there
had
been
his
lordship
has
published
a
poem
called
the
curse
of
minerva
the
subject
of
which
is
the
vengeance
of
the
goddess
on
lord
elgin
for
the
rape
of
the
parthenon
it
has
so
happened
that
i
wrote
at
athens
a
burlesque
poem
on
nearly
the
same
subject
mine
relates
to
the
vengeance
of
all
the
gods
which
i
called
the
atheniad
the
manuscript
was
sent
to
his
lordship
in
asia
minor
and
returned
to
me
through
mr
hobhouse
his
curse
of
minerva
i
saw
for
the
first
time
in
in
galignani
edition
of
his
works
in
the
giaour
which
he
published
a
short
time
before
the
bride
of
abydos
he
has
this
passage
descriptive
of
the
anxiety
with
which
the
mother
of
hassan
looks
out
for
the
arrival
of
her
son
the
browsing
camels
bells
are
tinkling
his
mother
look
from
her
lattice
high
she
saw
the
dews
of
eve
besprinkling
the
parterre
green
beneath
her
eye
she
saw
the
planets
faintly
twinkling
is
twilight
sure
his
train
is
nigh
she
could
not
rest
in
the
garden
bower
but
gazed
through
the
grate
of
his
steepest
tower
why
comes
he
not
and
his
steeds
are
fleet
nor
shrink
they
from
the
summer
heat
why
sends
not
the
bridegroom
his
promised
gift
is
his
heart
more
cold
or
his
barb
less
swift
his
lordship
was
well
read
in
the
bible
and
the
book
of
judges
chap
and
verse
has
the
following
passage
the
mother
of
sisera
looked
out
at
a
window
and
cried
through
the
lattice
why
is
his
chariot
so
long
in
coming
why
tarry
the
wheels
of
his
chariot
it
was
indeed
an
early
trick
of
his
lordship
to
filch
good
things
in
the
lamentation
for
kirke
white
in
which
he
compares
him
to
an
eagle
wounded
by
an
arrow
feathered
from
his
own
wing
he
says
so
the
struck
eagle
stretch
upon
the
plain
no
more
through
rolling
clouds
to
soar
again
view
his
own
feather
on
the
fatal
dart
and
winged
the
shaft
that
quivered
in
his
heart
the
ancients
have
certainly
stolen
the
best
ideas
of
the
moderns
this
very
thought
may
be
found
in
the
works
of
that
waller
that
eagle
fate
and
mine
are
one
which
on
the
shaft
that
made
him
die
espied
a
feather
of
his
own
wherewith
he
wont
to
soar
on
high
his
lordship
disdained
to
commit
any
larceny
on
me
and
no
doubt
the
following
passage
from
the
giaour
is
perfectly
original
it
is
as
if
the
dead
could
feel
the
icy
worm
around
them
steal
and
shudder
as
the
reptiles
creep
to
revel
their
rotting
sleep
without
the
power
to
scare
away
the
cold
consumers
of
their
clay
i
do
not
claim
any
paternity
in
these
lines
but
not
the
most
judicious
action
of
all
my
youth
was
to
publish
certain
dramatic
sketches
and
his
lordship
had
the
printed
book
in
his
possession
long
before
the
giaour
was
published
and
may
have
read
the
following
passage
in
a
dream
which
was
intended
to
be
very
hideous
then
did
i
hear
around
the
churme
and
chirruping
of
busy
reptiles
at
hideous
banquet
on
the
royal
dead
full
soon
methought
the
loathsome
epicures
came
thick
on
me
and
underneath
my
shroud
i
felt
the
and
beetle
creep
and
on
my
breast
the
cold
worm
coil
and
crawl
however
i
have
said
quite
enough
on
this
subject
both
as
respects
myself
and
his
seeming
plagiarisms
which
might
be
multiplied
to
legions
such
occasional
accidental
imitations
are
not
things
of
much
importance
all
poets
and
authors
in
general
avail
themselves
of
their
reading
and
knowledge
to
enhance
the
interest
of
their
works
it
can
only
be
considered
as
one
of
lord
byron
spurts
of
spleen
that
he
felt
so
much
about
a
coincidence
which
ought
not
to
have
disturbed
him
but
it
may
be
thought
by
the
notice
taken
of
it
that
it
disturbs
myself
more
than
it
really
does
and
that
it
would
have
been
enough
to
have
merely
said
perhaps
when
some
friend
is
hereafter
doing
as
indulgently
for
me
the
same
kind
of
task
that
i
have
undertaken
for
byron
there
may
be
found
among
my
memoranda
notes
as
little
flattering
to
his
lordship
as
those
in
his
concerning
me
i
hope
however
that
friend
will
have
more
respect
for
my
memory
than
to
imitate
the
taste
of
mr
moore

mind
the
friar
ghost
the
marriage
a
member
of
the
drury

committee
embarrassed
affairs
the
separation
the
year
was
perhaps
the
period
of
all
lord
byron
life
in
which
he
was
seen
to
most
advantage
the
fame
of
childe
harold
was
then
in
its
brightest
noon
and
in
that
year
he
produced
the
giaour
and
the
bride
of
abydos
compositions
not
only
of
equal
power
but
even
tinted
with
superior
beauties
he
was
himself
soothed
by
the
full
enjoyment
of
his
political
rank
and
station
and
though
his
manners
and
character
had
not
exactly
answered
to
the
stern
and
stately
imaginations
which
had
been
formed
of
his
dispositions
and
appearance
still
he
was
acknowledged
to
be
no
common
man
and
his
company
in
consequence
was
eagerly
courted
it
forms
no
part
of
the
plan
of
this
work
to
repeat
the
gossip
and
tattle
of
private
society
but
occurrences
happened
to
lord
byron
which
engaged
both
and
some
of
them
can
not
well
be
passed
over
unnoticed
one
of
these
took
place
during
the
spring
of
this
year
and
having
been
a
subject
of
newspaper
remark
it
may
with
less
impropriety
be
mentioned
than
others
which
were
more
indecorously
made
the
topics
of
general
discussion
the
incident
alluded
to
was
an
extravagant
scene
enacted
by
a
lady
of
high
rank
at
a
rout
given
by
lady
heathcote
in
which
in
revenge
as
it
was
reported
for
having
been
rejected
by
lord
byron
she
made
a
suicidal
attempt
with
an
instrument
which
scarcely
penetrated
if
it
could
even
inflict
any
permanent
mark
on
the
skin
the
insane
attachment
of
this
eccentric
lady
to
his
lordship
was
well
known
insane
is
the
only
epithet
that
can
be
applied
to
the
actions
of
a
married
woman
who
in
the
disguise
of
her
page
flung
herself
to
a
man
who
as
she
told
a
friend
of
mine
was
ashamed
to
be
in
love
with
her
because
she
was
not
beautiful
an
expression
at
once
curious
and
just
evincing
a
shrewd
perception
of
the
springs
of
his
lordship
conduct
and
the
acuteness
blended
with
frenzy
and
talent
which
distinguished
herself
lord
byron
unquestionably
at
that
time
cared
little
for
her
in
showing
me
her
picture
some
two
or
three
days
after
the
affair
and
laughing
at
the
absurdity
of
it
he
bestowed
on
her
the
endearing
diminutive
of
vixen
with
a
hearted
adjective
that
i
judiciously
omit
the
immediate
cause
of
this
tragical
flourish
was
never
very
well
understood
but
in
the
course
of
the
evening
she
had
made
several
attempts
to
fasten
on
his
lordship
and
was
shunned
certain
it
is
she
had
not
like
burke
in
the
house
of
commons
premeditatedly
brought
a
dagger
in
her
reticule
on
purpose
for
the
scene
but
seeing
herself
an
object
of
scorn
she
seized
the
first
weapon
she
could
find
some
said
a
pair
of
scissors
others
more
scandalously
broken
and
attempted
an
incision
of
the
jugular
to
the
consternation
of
all
the
dowagers
and
the
pathetic
admiration
of
every
miss
who
witnessed
or
heard
of
the
rapture
lord
byron
at
the
time
was
in
another
room
talking
with
prince
k
when
lord
p
came
with
a
face
full
of
consternation
and
told
them
what
had
happened
the
cruel
poet
instead
of
being
agitated
by
the
tidings
or
standing
in
the
smallest
degree
in
need
of
a
bottle
knitted
his
scowl
and
said
with
a
contemptuous
indifference
it
is
only
a
trick
all
things
considered
he
was
perhaps
not
uncharitable
and
a
man
of
less
vanity
would
have
felt
pretty
much
as
his
lordship
appeared
to
do
on
the
occasion
the
whole
affair
was
eminently
ridiculous
and
what
increased
the
absurdity
was
a
letter
she
addressed
to
a
friend
of
mine
on
the
subject
and
which
he
thought
too
good
to
be
reserved
only
for
his
own
particular
study
it
was
in
this
year
that
lord
byron
first
proposed
for
miss
milbanke
having
been
urged
by
several
of
his
friends
to
marry
that
lady
was
specially
recommended
to
him
for
a
wife
it
has
been
alleged
that
he
deeply
resented
her
rejection
of
his
proposal
and
i
doubt
not
in
the
first
instance
his
vanity
may
have
been
a
little
piqued
but
as
he
cherished
no
very
animated
attachment
to
her
and
moreover
as
she
enjoyed
no
celebrity
in
public
opinion
to
make
the
rejection
important
the
resentment
was
not
i
am
persuaded
either
of
an
intense
or
vindictive
kind
on
the
contrary
he
has
borne
testimony
to
the
respect
in
which
he
held
her
character
and
accomplishments
and
an
incidental
remark
in
his
journal
i
shall
be
in
love
with
her
again
if
i
do
take
care
is
proof
enough
that
his
anger
was
not
of
a
very
fierce
or
kind
the
account
ascribed
to
him
of
his
introduction
to
miss
milbanke
and
the
history
of
their
attachment
ought
not
to
be
omitted
because
it
serves
to
illustrate
in
some
degree
the
state
of
his
feelings
towards
her
and
is
so
probable
that
i
doubt
not
it
is
in
the
main
correct
the
first
time
of
my
seeing
miss
milbanke
was
at
lady
it
was
a
fatal
day
and
i
remember
that
in
going
upstairs
i
stumbled
and
remarked
to
moore
who
accompanied
me
that
it
was
a
bad
omen
i
ought
to
have
taken
the
warning
on
entering
the
room
i
observed
a
young
lady
more
simply
dressed
than
the
rest
of
the
assembly
sitting
alone
upon
a
sofa
i
took
her
for
a
female
companion
and
asked
if
i
was
right
in
my
conjecture
is
a
great
heiress
said
he
in
a
whisper
that
became
lower
as
he
proceeded
had
better
marry
her
and
repair
the
old
place
newstead
there
was
something
piquant
and
what
we
term
pretty
in
miss
milbanke
her
features
were
small
and
feminine
though
not
regular
she
had
the
fairest
skin
imaginable
her
figure
was
perfect
for
her
height
and
there
was
a
simplicity
a
retired
modesty
about
her
which
was
very
characteristic
and
formed
a
happy
contrast
to
the
cold
artificial
formality
and
studied
stiffness
which
is
called
fashion
she
interested
me
exceedingly
i
became
daily
more
attached
to
her
and
it
ended
in
my
making
her
a
proposal
that
was
rejected
her
refusal
was
couched
in
terms
which
could
not
offend
me
i
was
besides
persuaded
that
in
declining
my
offer
she
was
governed
by
the
influence
of
her
mother
and
was
the
more
confirmed
in
my
opinion
by
her
reviving
our
correspondence
herself
twelve
months
after
the
tenour
of
her
letter
was
that
although
she
could
not
love
me
she
desired
my
friendship
friendship
is
a
dangerous
word
for
young
ladies
it
is
love
and
waiting
for
a
fine
day
to
fly
but
lord
byron
possessed
this
sort
of
irrepressible
predilections
was
so
much
the
agent
of
impulses
that
he
could
not
keep
long
in
unison
with
the
world
or
in
harmony
with
his
friends
without
malice
or
the
instigation
of
any
ill
spirit
he
was
continually
provoking
malignity
and
revenge
his
verses
on
the
princess
charlotte
weeping
and
his
other
merciless
satire
on
her
father
begot
him
no
friends
and
armed
the
hatred
of
his
enemies
there
was
indeed
something
like
ingratitude
in
the
attack
on
the
regent
for
his
royal
highness
had
been
particularly
civil
had
intimated
a
wish
to
have
him
introduced
to
him
and
byron
fond
of
the
distinction
spoke
of
it
with
a
sense
of
gratification
these
instances
as
well
as
others
of
gratuitous
spleen
only
justified
the
misrepresentations
which
had
been
insinuated
against
himself
and
what
was
humour
in
his
nature
was
ascribed
to
vice
in
his
principles
before
the
year
was
at
an
end
his
popularity
was
evidently
beginning
to
wane
of
this
he
was
conscious
himself
and
braved
the
frequent
attacks
on
his
character
and
genius
with
an
affectation
of
indifference
under
which
those
who
had
at
all
observed
the
singular
associations
of
his
recollections
and
ideas
must
have
discerned
the
symptoms
of
a
strange
disease
he
was
tainted
with
a
herodian
malady
of
the
mind
his
thoughts
were
often
hateful
to
himself
but
there
was
an
ecstasy
in
the
conception
as
if
delight
could
be
mingled
with
horror
i
think
however
he
struggled
to
master
the
fatality
and
that
his
resolution
to
marry
was
dictated
by
an
honourable
desire
to
give
hostages
to
society
against
the
wild
wilfulness
of
his
imagination
it
is
a
curious
and
a
mystical
fact
that
at
the
period
to
which
i
am
alluding
and
a
very
short
time
only
a
little
month
before
he
successfully
solicited
the
hand
of
miss
milbanke
being
at
newstead
he
fancied
that
he
saw
the
ghost
of
the
monk
which
is
supposed
to
haunt
the
abbey
and
to
make
its
ominous
appearance
when
misfortune
or
death
impends
over
the
master
of
the
the
story
of
the
apparition
in
the
sixteenth
canto
of
don
juan
is
derived
from
this
family
legend
and
norman
abbey
in
the
thirteenth
of
the
same
poem
is
a
rich
and
elaborate
description
of
newstead
after
his
proposal
to
miss
milbanke
had
been
accepted
a
considerable
time
nearly
three
months
elapsed
before
the
marriage
was
completed
in
consequence
of
the
embarrassed
condition
in
which
when
the
necessary
settlements
were
to
be
made
he
found
his
affairs
this
state
of
things
with
the
previous
unhappy
controversy
with
himself
and
anger
at
the
world
was
to
gladden
his
nuptials
but
besides
these
real
evils
his
mind
was
awed
with
gloomy
presentiments
a
shadow
of
some
advancing
misfortune
darkened
his
spirit
and
the
ceremony
was
performed
with
sacrificial
feelings
and
those
dark
and
chilling
circumstances
which
he
has
so
touchingly
described
in
the
dream
i
saw
him
stand
before
an
altar
with
a
gentle
bride
her
face
was
fair
but
was
not
that
which
made
the
starlight
of
his
boyhood
as
he
stood
even
at
the
altar
his
brow
there
came
the
aspect
and
the
quivering
shock
that
in
the
antique
oratory
shook
his
bosom
in
its
solitude
and
then
as
in
that
hour
a
moment
his
face
the
tablet
of
unutterable
thoughts
was
traced
and
then
it
faded
as
it
came
and
he
stood
calm
and
quiet
and
he
spoke
the
faltering
vows
but
heard
not
his
own
words
and
all
things
reeled
around
him
he
could
see
not
that
which
was
nor
that
which
should
have
been
but
the
old
mansion
and
the
accustom
hall
and
the
remembered
chambers
and
the
place
the
day
the
hour
the
sunshine
and
the
shade
all
things
pertaining
to
that
place
and
hour
and
her
who
was
his
destiny
came
back
and
thrust
themselves
between
him
and
the
light
this
is
very
affectingly
described
and
his
prose
description
bears
testimony
to
its
correctness
it
had
been
predicted
by
mrs
williams
that
was
to
be
a
dangerous
age
for
me
the
telling
witch
was
right
it
was
destined
to
prove
so
i
shall
never
forget
the
of
january
lady
byron
was
the
only
unconcerned
person
present
lady
noel
her
mother
cried
i
trembled
like
a
leaf
made
the
wrong
responses
and
after
the
ceremony
called
her
miss
milbanke
there
is
a
singular
history
attached
to
the
ring
the
very
day
the
match
was
concluded
a
ring
of
my
mother
that
had
been
lost
was
dug
up
by
the
gardener
at
newstead
i
thought
it
was
sent
on
purpose
for
the
wedding
but
my
mother
marriage
had
not
been
a
fortunate
one
and
this
ring
was
doomed
to
be
the
seal
of
an
unhappier
union
still
after
the
ordeal
was
over
we
set
off
for
a
of
sir
ralph
lady
b
father
and
i
was
surprised
at
the
arrangements
for
the
journey
and
somewhat
out
of
humour
to
find
the
lady
maid
stuck
between
me
and
my
bride
it
was
rather
too
early
to
assume
the
husband
so
i
was
forced
to
submit
but
it
was
not
with
a
very
good
grace
i
have
been
accused
of
saying
on
getting
into
the
carriage
that
i
had
married
lady
byron
out
of
spite
and
because
she
had
refused
me
twice
though
i
was
for
a
moment
vexed
at
her
prudery
or
whatever
you
may
choose
to
call
it
if
i
had
made
so
uncavalier
not
to
say
brutal
a
speech
i
am
convinced
lady
byron
would
instantly
have
left
the
carriage
to
me
and
the
maid
she
had
spirit
enough
to
have
done
so
and
would
properly
have
resented
the
affront
our
honeymoon
was
not
all
sunshine
it
had
its
clouds
i
was
not
so
young
when
my
father
died
but
that
i
perfectly
remember
him
and
had
a
very
early
horror
of
matrimony
from
the
sight
of
domestic
broils
this
feeling
came
over
me
very
strongly
at
my
wedding
something
whispered
me
that
i
was
sealing
my
own
warrant
i
am
a
great
believer
in
presentiments
socrates
demon
was
not
a
fiction
monk
lewis
had
his
monitor
and
napoleon
many
warnings
at
the
last
moment
i
would
have
retreated
could
i
have
done
so
i
called
to
mind
a
friend
of
mine
who
had
married
a
young
beautiful
and
rich
girl
and
yet
was
miserable
he
had
strongly
urged
me
against
putting
my
neck
in
the
same
yoke
for
some
time
after
the
marriage
things
went
on
in
the
usual
matrimonial
routine
until
he
was
chosen
into
the
managing
committee
of
drury
lane
an
office
in
which
had
he
possessed
the
slightest
degree
of
talent
for
business
he
might
have
done
much
good
it
was
justly
expected
that
the
illiterate
presumption
which
had
so
long
deterred
poetical
genius
from
approaching
the
stage
would
have
shrunk
abashed
from
before
him
but
he
either
felt
not
the
importance
of
the
duty
he
had
been
called
to
perform
or
what
is
more
probable
yielding
to
the
allurements
of
the
moment
forgot
that
duty
in
the
amusement
which
he
derived
from
the
talents
and
peculiarities
of
the
players
no
situation
could
be
more
unfit
for
a
man
of
his
temperament
than
one
which
exposed
him
to
form
intimacies
with
persons
whose
profession
almost
necessarily
leads
them
to
undervalue
the
domestic
virtues
it
is
said
that
the
course
of
life
into
which
he
was
drawn
after
he
joined
the
managing
committee
of
drury
lane
was
not
in
unison
with
the
methodical
habits
of
lady
byron
but
independently
of
outdoor
causes
of
connubial
discontent
and
incompatibility
of
temper
their
domestic
affairs
were
falling
into
confusion
my
income
at
this
period
says
lord
byron
was
small
and
somewhat
bespoken
we
had
a
house
in
town
gave
had
separate
carriages
and
launched
into
every
sort
of
extravagance
this
could
not
last
long
my
wife
ten
thousand
pounds
soon
melted
away
i
was
beset
by
duns
and
at
length
an
execution
was
levied
and
the
bailiffs
put
in
possession
of
the
very
beds
we
had
to
sleep
on
this
was
no
very
agreeable
state
of
affairs
no
very
pleasant
scene
for
lady
byron
to
witness
and
it
was
agreed
she
should
pay
her
father
a
visit
till
the
storm
had
blown
over
and
some
arrangement
had
been
made
with
my
creditors
from
this
visit
her
ladyship
never
returned
a
separation
took
place
but
too
much
has
been
said
to
the
world
respecting
it
and
i
have
no
taste
for
the
subject
whatever
was
the
immediate
cause
the
event
itself
was
not
of
so
rare
a
kind
as
to
deserve
that
the
attention
of
the
public
should
be
indelicately
courted
to
it
beyond
all
question
however
lord
byron
notions
of
connubial
obligations
were
rather
philosophical
there
are
said
he
to
captain
parry
so
many
undefinable
and
nameless
and
not
to
be
named
causes
of
dislike
aversion
and
disgust
in
the
matrimonial
state
that
it
is
always
impossible
for
the
public
or
the
friends
of
the
parties
to
judge
between
man
and
wife
theirs
is
a
relation
about
which
nobody
but
themselves
can
form
a
correct
idea
or
have
any
right
to
speak
as
long
as
neither
party
commits
gross
injustice
towards
the
other
as
long
as
neither
the
woman
nor
the
man
is
guilty
of
any
offence
which
is
injurious
to
the
community
as
long
as
the
husband
provides
for
his
offspring
and
secures
the
public
against
the
dangers
arising
from
their
neglected
education
or
from
the
charge
of
supporting
them
by
what
right
does
it
censure
him
for
ceasing
to
dwell
under
the
same
roof
with
a
woman
who
is
to
him
because
he
knows
her
while
others
do
not
an
object
of
loathing
can
anything
be
more
monstrous
than
for
the
public
voice
to
compel
individuals
who
dislike
each
other
to
continue
their
cohabitation
this
is
at
least
the
effect
of
its
interfering
with
a
relationship
of
which
it
has
no
possible
means
of
judging
it
does
not
indeed
drag
a
man
to
a
woman
bed
by
physical
force
but
it
does
exert
a
moral
force
continually
and
effectively
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose
nobody
can
escape
this
force
but
those
who
are
too
high
or
those
who
are
too
low
for
public
opinion
to
reach
or
those
hypocrites
who
are
before
others
the
loudest
in
their
approbation
of
the
empty
and
unmeaning
forms
of
society
that
they
may
securely
indulge
all
their
propensities
in
secret
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
in
which
he
is
represented
to
have
stated
these
opinions
he
added
what
i
have
pleasure
in
quoting
because
the
sentiments
are
generous
in
respect
to
his
wife
and
strikingly
characteristic
of
himself
lady
byron
has
a
liberal
mind
particularly
as
to
religious
opinions
and
i
wish
when
i
married
her
that
i
had
possessed
the
same
command
over
myself
that
i
now
do
had
i
possessed
a
little
more
wisdom
and
more
forbearance
we
might
have
been
happy
i
wished
when
i
was
just
married
to
have
remained
in
the
country
particularly
till
my
pecuniary
embarrassments
were
over
i
knew
the
society
of
london
i
knew
the
characters
of
many
who
are
called
ladies
with
whom
lady
byron
would
necessarily
have
to
associate
and
i
dreaded
her
contact
with
them
but
i
have
too
much
of
my
mother
about
me
to
be
dictated
to
i
like
freedom
from
constraint
i
hate
artificial
regulations
my
conduct
has
always
been
dictated
by
my
own
feelings
and
lady
byron
was
quite
the
creature
of
rules
she
was
not
permitted
either
to
ride
or
run
or
walk
but
as
the
physician
prescribed
she
was
not
suffered
to
go
out
when
i
wished
to
go
and
then
the
old
house
was
a
mere
i
dreamed
of
ghosts
and
thought
of
them
waking
it
was
an
existence
i
could
not
support
here
lord
byron
broke
off
abruptly
saying
i
hate
to
speak
of
my
family
affairs
though
i
have
been
compelled
to
talk
nonsense
concerning
them
to
some
of
my
butterfly
visitors
glad
on
any
terms
to
get
rid
of
their
importunities
i
long
to
be
again
on
the
mountains
i
am
fond
of
solitude
and
should
never
talk
nonsense
if
i
always
found
plain
men
to
talk
to

reflections
on

the

just
concluded
may
disappoint
the

of
some
of
my
readers
but
i
would
rather
have
said
less
than
so
much
could
so
little
have
been
allowed
for
i
have
never
been
able
to
reconcile
to
my
notions
of
propriety
the
exposure
of
domestic
concerns
which
the
world
has
no
right
claim
to
know
and
can
only
urge
the
plea
of
curiosity
for
desiring
to
see
explained
the
scope
of
my
undertaking
comprehends
only
the
public
and
intellectual
character
of
lord
byron
every
word
that
i
have
found
it
necessary
to
say
respecting
his
private
affairs
has
been
set
down
with
reluctance
nor
should
i
have
touched
so
freely
on
his
failings
but
that
the
consequences
have
deeply
influenced
his
poetical
conceptions
there
is
however
one
point
connected
with
his
conjugal
differences
which
can
not
be
overlooked
nor
noticed
without
animadversion
he
was
too
active
himself
in
bespeaking
the
public
sympathy
against
his
lady
it
is
true
that
but
for
that
error
the
world
might
never
have
seen
the
verses
written
by
him
on
the
occasion
and
perhaps
it
was
the
friends
who
were
about
him
at
the
time
who
ought
chiefly
to
be
blamed
for
having
given
them
circulation
but
in
saying
this
i
am
departing
from
the
rule
i
had
prescribed
to
myself
while
i
ought
only
to
have
remarked
that
the
compositions
alluded
to
both
the
and
the
anathema
on
mrs
charlemont
are
splendid
corroborations
of
the
metaphysical
fact
which
it
is
the
main
object
of
this
work
to
illustrate
namely
that
byron
was
only
original
and
truly
great
when
he
wrote
from
the
dictates
of
his
own
breast
and
described
from
the
suggestions
of
things
he
had
seen
when
his
imagination
found
not
in
his
subject
uses
for
the
materials
of
his
experience
and
opportunities
to
embody
them
it
seemed
to
be
no
longer
the
same
high
and
mysterious
faculty
that
so
ruled
the
tides
of
the
feelings
of
others
he
then
appeared
a
more
ordinary
poet
a
skilful
the
necromancy
which
held
the
reader
spellbound
became
ineffectual
and
the
charm
and
the
glory
which
interested
so
intensely
and
shone
so
radiantly
on
his
configurations
from
realities
all
failed
and
faded
for
his
genius
dealt
not
with
airy
fancies
but
had
its
power
and
dominion
amid
the
living
and
the
local
of
the
actual
world
i
shall
now
return
to
the
consideration
of
his
works
and
the
first
in
order
is
the
corsair
published
in
he
seems
to
have
been
perfectly
sensible
that
this
beautiful
composition
was
in
his
best
peculiar
manner
it
is
indeed
a
pirate
isle
peopled
with
his
own
creatures
it
has
been
alleged
that
lord
byron
was
indebted
to
sir
walter
scott
poem
of
rokeby
for
the
leading
incidents
of
the
corsair
but
the
resemblance
is
not
to
me
very
obvious
besides
the
whole
style
of
the
poem
is
so
strikingly
in
his
own
manner
that
even
had
he
borrowed
the
plan
it
was
only
as
a
thread
to
string
his
own
original
conceptions
upon
the
beauty
and
brilliancy
of
them
could
not
be
borrowed
and
are
not
imitations
there
were
two
islands
in
the
archipelago
when
lord
byron
was
in
greece
considered
as
the
chief
haunts
of
the
pirates
stampalia
and
a
long
narrow
island
between
cape
colonna
and
zea
jura
also
was
a
little
tainted
in
its
reputation
i
think
however
from
the
description
that
the
pirate
isle
of
the
corsair
is
the
island
off
cape
colonna
it
is
a
rude
rocky
mass
i
know
not
to
what
particular
coron
if
there
be
more
than
one
the
poet
alludes
for
the
coron
of
the
morea
is
neighbour
to
if
not
in
the
mainote
territory
a
tract
of
country
which
never
submitted
to
the
turks
and
was
exempted
from
the
jurisdiction
of
mussulman
officers
by
the
payment
of
an
annual
tribute
the
mainotes
themselves
are
all
pirates
and
robbers
if
it
be
in
that
coron
that
byron
has
placed
seyd
the
pasha
it
must
be
attributed
to
inadvertency
his
lordship
was
never
there
nor
in
any
part
of
maina
nor
does
he
describe
the
place
a
circumstance
which
of
itself
goes
far
to
prove
the
inadvertency
it
is
however
only
in
making
it
the
seat
of
a
turkish
pasha
that
any
error
has
been
committed
in
working
out
the
incidents
of
the
poem
where
descriptions
of
scenery
are
given
they
relate
chiefly
to
athens
and
its
neighbourhood
in
themselves
these
descriptions
are
executed
with
an
exquisite
felicity
but
they
are
brought
in
without
any
obvious
reason
wherefore
in
fact
they
appear
to
have
been
written
independently
of
the
poem
and
are
patched
on
shreds
of
purple
which
could
have
been
spared
the
character
of
conrad
the
corsair
may
be
described
as
a
combination
of
the
warrior
of
albania
and
a
naval
officer
childe
harold
mingled
with
the
hero
of
the
giaour
a
man
of
loneliness
and
mystery
scarce
seen
to
smile
and
seldom
heard
to
sigh
robust
but
not
herculean
to
the
sight
no
giant
frame
sets
forth
his
common
height
yet
in
the
whole
who
paused
to
look
again
saw
more
than
marks
the
crowd
of
vulgar
men
they
gaze
and
marvel
how
and
still
confess
that
thus
it
is
but
why
they
can
not
guess
his
cheek
his
forehead
high
and
pale
the
sable
curls
in
wild
profusion
veil
and
oft
perforce
his
rising
lip
reveals
the
haughtier
thought
it
curbs
but
scarce
conceals
though
smooth
his
voice
and
calm
his
general
mien
still
seems
there
something
he
would
not
have
seen
his
features
deepening
lines
and
varying
hue
at
times
attracted
yet
perplex
the
view
as
if
within
that
murkiness
of
mind
work
feelings
fearful
and
yet
undefined
such
might
he
be
that
none
could
truly
tell
too
close
inquiry
his
stern
glance
could
quell
there
breathed
but
few
whose
aspect
could
defy
the
full
encounter
of
his
searching
eye
he
had
the
skill
when
cunning
gaze
to
seek
to
probe
his
heart
and
watch
his
changing
cheek
at
once
the
observer
purpose
to
espy
and
on
himself
roll
back
his
scrutiny
lest
he
to
conrad
rather
should
betray
some
secret
thought
than
drag
that
chief
to
day
there
was
a
laughing
devil
in
his
sneer
that
raised
emotions
both
of
rage
and
fear
and
where
his
frown
of
hatred
darkly
fell
hope
withering
fled
and
mercy
sigh
farewell
it
will
be
allowed
that
in
this
portrait
some
of
the
darker
features
and
harsher
lineaments
of
byron
himself
are
very
evident
but
with
a
more
fixed
sternness
than
belonged
to
him
for
it
was
only
by
fits
that
he
could
put
on
such
severity
conrad
is
however
a
higher
creation
than
any
which
he
had
previously
described
instead
of
the
listlessness
of
childe
harold
he
is
active
and
enterprising
such
as
the
noble
pilgrim
would
have
been
but
for
the
satiety
which
had
relaxed
his
energies
there
is
also
about
him
a
solemnity
different
from
the
animation
of
the
giaour
a
penitential
despair
arising
from
a
cause
undisclosed
the
giaour
though
wounded
and
fettered
and
laid
in
a
dungeon
would
not
have
felt
as
conrad
is
supposed
to
feel
in
that
situation
the
following
bold
and
terrific
verses
descriptive
of
the
maelstrom
agitations
of
remorse
could
not
have
been
appropriately
applied
to
the
despair
of
grief
the
predominant
source
of
emotion
in
the
giaour
there
is
a
war
a
chaos
of
the
mind
when
all
its
elements
convulsed
combined
lie
dark
and
jarring
with
perturbed
force
and
gnashing
with
impenitent
remorse
that
juggling
fiend
who
never
spake
before
but
cries
i
warn
thee
when
the
deed
is
vain
voice
the
spirit
burning
but
unbent
may
writhe
rebel
the
weak
alone
repent
the
character
of
conrad
is
undoubtedly
finely
imagined
as
the
painters
would
say
it
is
in
the
highest
style
of
art
and
brought
out
with
sublime
effect
but
still
it
is
only
another
phase
of
the
same
portentous
meteor
that
was
nebulous
in
childe
harold
and
fiery
in
the
giaour
to
the
safe
and
inhabitants
of
christendom
the
corsair
seems
to
present
many
improbabilities
nevertheless
it
is
true
to
nature
and
in
every
part
of
the
levant
the
traveller
meets
with
individuals
whose
air
and
physiognomy
remind
him
of
conrad
the
incidents
of
the
story
also
so
wild
and
extravagant
to
the
snug
and
legal
notions
of
england
are
not
more
in
keeping
with
the
character
than
they
are
in
accordance
with
fact
and
reality
the
poet
suffers
immeasurable
injustice
when
it
is
attempted
to
determine
the
probability
of
the
wild
scenes
and
wilder
adventurers
of
his
tales
by
the
circumstances
and
characters
of
the
system
of
our
diurnal
affairs
probability
is
a
standard
formed
by
experience
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
anchorets
of
libraries
should
object
to
the
improbability
of
the
corsair
and
yet
acknowledge
the
poetical
power
displayed
in
the
composition
for
it
is
a
work
which
could
only
have
been
written
by
one
who
had
himself
seen
or
heard
on
the
spot
of
transactions
similar
to
those
he
has
described
no
course
of
reading
could
have
supplied
materials
for
a
narration
so
faithfully
descriptive
of
the
accidents
to
which
an
aegean
pirate
is
exposed
as
the
corsair
had
lord
byron
never
been
out
of
england
the
production
of
a
work
so
appropriate
in
reflection
so
wild
in
spirit
and
so
bold
in
invention
as
in
that
case
it
would
have
been
would
have
entitled
him
to
the
highest
honours
of
original
conception
or
been
rejected
as
extravagant
considered
as
the
result
of
things
seen
and
of
probabilities
suggested
by
transactions
not
uncommon
in
the
region
where
his
genius
gathered
the
ingredients
of
its
sorceries
more
than
the
half
of
its
merits
disappear
while
the
other
half
brighten
with
the
lustre
of
truth
the
manners
the
actions
and
the
incidents
were
new
to
the
english
mind
but
to
the
inhabitant
of
the
levant
they
have
long
been
familiar
and
the
traveller
who
visits
that
region
will
hesitate
to
admit
that
lord
byron
possessed
those
creative
powers
and
that
discernment
of
dark
bosoms
for
which
he
is
so
much
celebrated
because
he
will
see
there
how
little
of
invention
was
necessary
to
form
such
heroes
as
conrad
and
how
much
the
actual
traffic
of
life
and
trade
is
constantly
stimulating
enterprise
and
bravery
but
let
it
not
therefore
be
supposed
that
i
would
undervalue
either
the
genius
of
the
poet
or
the
merits
of
the
poem
in
saying
so
for
i
do
think
a
higher
faculty
has
been
exerted
in
the
corsair
than
in
childe
harold
in
the
latter
only
actual
things
are
described
freshly
and
vigorously
as
they
were
seen
and
feelings
expressed
eloquently
as
they
were
felt
but
in
the
former
the
talent
of
combination
has
been
splendidly
employed
the
one
is
a
view
from
nature
the
other
is
a
composition
both
from
nature
and
from
history
lara
which
appeared
soon
after
the
corsair
is
an
evident
supplement
to
it
the
description
of
the
hero
corresponds
in
person
and
character
with
conrad
so
that
the
remarks
made
on
the
corsair
apply
in
all
respects
to
lara
the
poem
itself
is
perhaps
in
elegance
superior
but
the
descriptions
are
not
so
vivid
simply
because
they
are
more
indebted
to
imagination
there
is
one
of
them
however
in
which
the
lake
and
abbey
of
newstead
are
dimly
shadowed
equal
in
sweetness
and
solemnity
to
anything
the
poet
has
ever
written
it
was
the
night
and
lara
glassy
stream
the
stars
are
studding
each
with
imaged
beam
so
calm
the
waters
scarcely
seem
to
stray
and
yet
they
glide
like
happiness
away
reflecting
far
and
from
high
the
immortal
lights
that
live
along
the
sky
its
banks
are
fringed
with
many
a
goodly
tree
and
flowers
the
fairest
that
may
feast
the
bee
such
in
her
chaplet
infant
dian
wove
and
innocence
would
offer
to
her
love
these
deck
the
shore
the
waves
their
channel
make
in
windings
bright
and
mazy
like
the
snake
all
was
so
still
so
soft
in
earth
and
air
you
scarce
would
start
to
meet
a
spirit
there
secure
that
naught
of
evil
could
delight
to
walk
in
such
a
scene
in
such
a
night
it
was
a
moment
only
for
the
good
so
lara
deemed
nor
longer
there
he
stood
but
turn
in
silence
to
his
such
scene
his
soul
no
more
could
contemplate
such
scene
reminded
him
of
other
days
of
skies
more
cloudless
moons
of
purer
blaze
of
nights
more
soft
and
frequent
hearts
that
now
no
no
the
storm
may
beat
upon
his
brow
unfelt
unsparing
but
a
night
like
this
a
night
of
beauty
mock
such
breast
as
his
he
turn
within
his
solitary
hall
and
his
high
shadow
shot
along
the
wall
there
were
the
painted
forms
of
other
times
all
they
left
of
virtues
or
of
crimes
save
vague
tradition
and
the
gloomy
vaults
that
hid
their
dust
their
foibles
and
their
faults
and
half
a
column
of
the
pompous
page
that
speeds
the
spacious
tale
from
age
to
age
where
history
pen
its
praise
or
blame
supplies
and
lies
like
truth
and
still
most
truly
lies
he
mused
and
as
the
moonbeam
shone
through
the
dim
lattice
the
floor
of
stone
and
the
roof
and
saints
that
there
gothic
windows
knelt
in
pictured
prayer
reflected
in
fantastic
figures
grew
like
life
but
not
like
mortal
life
to
view
his
bristling
locks
of
sable
brow
of
gloom
and
the
wide
waving
of
his
shaken
plume
glanced
like
a
spectre
attributes
and
gave
his
aspect
all
that
terror
gives
the
grave
that
byron
wrote
best
when
he
wrote
of
himself
and
of
his
own
has
probably
been
already
made
sufficiently
apparent
in
this
respect
he
stands
alone
and
apart
from
all
other
poets
and
there
will
be
occasion
to
show
that
this
peculiarity
extended
much
farther
over
all
his
works
than
merely
to
those
which
may
be
said
to
have
required
him
to
be
thus
personal
the
great
distinction
indeed
of
his
merit
consists
in
that
singularity
shakspeare
in
drawing
the
materials
of
his
dramas
from
tales
and
history
has
with
wonderful
art
given
from
his
own
invention
and
imagination
the
fittest
and
most
appropriate
sentiments
and
language
and
admiration
at
the
perfection
with
which
he
has
accomplished
this
can
never
be
exhausted
the
difference
between
byron
and
shakspeare
consists
in
the
curious
accident
if
it
may
be
so
called
by
which
the
former
was
placed
in
circumstances
which
taught
him
to
feel
in
himself
the
very
sentiments
that
he
has
ascribed
to
his
characters
shakspeare
created
the
feelings
of
his
and
with
such
excellence
that
they
are
not
only
probable
to
the
situations
but
give
to
the
personifications
the
individuality
of
living
persons
byron
are
scarcely
less
so
but
with
him
there
was
no
invention
only
experience
and
when
he
attempts
to
express
more
than
he
has
himself
known
he
is
always
comparatively
feeble
chapter
xxxi
byron
determines
to
reside
abroad
visits
the
plain
of
waterloo
state
of
his
feelings
from
different
incidental
expressions
in
his
correspondence
it
is
sufficiently
evident
that
byron
before
his
marriage
intended
to
reside
abroad
in
his
letter
to
me
of
the
december
he
distinctly
states
this
intention
and
intimates
that
he
then
thought
of
establishing
his
home
in
greece
it
is
not
therefore
surprising
that
after
his
separation
from
lady
byron
he
should
have
determined
to
carry
this
intention
into
effect
for
at
that
period
besides
the
calumny
heaped
upon
him
from
all
quarters
the
embarrassment
of
his
affairs
and
the
retaliatory
satire
all
tended
to
force
him
into
exile
he
had
no
longer
any
particular
tie
to
bind
him
to
england
on
the
of
april
he
sailed
for
ostend
and
resumed
the
composition
of
childe
harold
it
may
be
said
from
the
moment
of
his
embarkation
in
it
however
there
is
no
longer
the
fiction
of
an
imaginary
character
stalking
like
a
shadow
amid
his
descriptions
and
reflections
he
comes
more
decidedly
forwards
as
the
hero
in
his
own
person
in
passing
to
brussels
he
visited
the
field
of
waterloo
and
the
slight
sketch
which
he
has
given
in
the
poem
of
that
eventful
conflict
is
still
the
finest
which
has
yet
been
written
on
the
subject
but
the
note
of
his
visit
to
the
field
is
of
more
importance
to
my
present
purpose
inasmuch
as
it
tends
to
illustrate
the
querulous
state
of
his
own
mind
at
the
time
i
went
on
horseback
twice
over
the
field
comparing
it
with
my
recollection
of
similar
scenes
as
a
plain
waterloo
seems
marked
out
for
the
scene
of
some
great
action
though
this
may
be
mere
imagination
i
have
viewed
with
attention
those
of
platea
troy

chaevronae
and
marathon
and
the
field
round
mont
st
jean
and
hugoumont
appears
to
want
little
but
a
better
cause
and
that
indefinable
but
impressive
halo
which
the
lapse
of
ages
throws
around
a
celebrated
spot
to
vie
in
interest
with
any
or
all
of
these
except
perhaps
the
the
expression
a
better
cause
could
only
have
been
engendered
in
mere
waywardness
but
throughout
his
reflections
at
this
period
a
peevish
towards
england
is
often
manifested
as
if
he
sought
to
attract
attention
by
exasperating
the
national
pride
that
pride
which
he
secretly
flattered
himself
was
to
be
augmented
by
his
own
fame
i
can
not
in
tracing
his
travels
through
the
third
canto
test
the
accuracy
of
his
descriptions
as
in
the
former
two
but
as
they
are
all
drawn
from
actual
views
they
have
the
same
vivid
individuality
impressed
upon
them
nothing
can
be
more
simple
and
affecting
than
the
following
picture
nor
less
likely
to
be
an
imaginary
scene
by
coblentz
on
a
rise
of
gentle
ground
there
is
a
small
and
simple
pyramid
crowning
the
summit
of
the
verdant
mound
beneath
its
base
are
heroes
ashes
hid
our
enemies
and
let
not
that
forbid
honour
to
marceau
whose
early
tomb
tears
big
tears
rush
from
the
rough
soldier
lid
lamenting
and
yet
envying
such
a
doom
falling
for
france
whose
rights
he
battled
to
resume
perhaps
few
passages
of
descriptive
poetry
excel
that
in
which
reference
is
made
to
the
column
of
avenches
the
ancient
aventicum
it
combines
with
an
image
distinct
and
picturesque
poetical
associations
full
of
the
grave
and
moral
breathings
of
olden
forms
and
hoary
antiquity
by
a
lone
wall
a
lonelier
column
rears
a
gray
and
aspect
of
old
days
is
the
last
remnant
of
the
wreck
of
years
and
looks
as
with
the
gaze
of
one
to
stone
converted
by
amaze
yet
still
with
consciousness
and
there
it
stands
making
a
marvel
that
it
not
decays
when
the
coeval
pride
of
human
hands
levell
aventicum
hath
strew
her
subject
lands
but
the
most
remarkable
quality
in
the
third
canto
is
the
deep
low
bass
of
thought
which
runs
through
several
passages
and
which
gives
to
it
when
considered
with
reference
to
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
written
the
serious
character
of
documentary
evidence
as
to
the
remorseful
condition
of
the
poet
mind
it
would
be
after
what
has
already
been
pointed
out
in
brighter
incidents
affectation
not
to
say
that
these
sad
bursts
of
feeling
and
wild
paroxysms
bear
strong
indications
of
having
been
suggested
by
the
wreck
of
his
domestic
happiness
and
dictated
by
contrition
for
the
part
he
had
himself
taken
in
the
ruin
the
following
reflections
on
the
unguarded
hour
are
full
of
pathos
and
solemnity
amounting
almost
to
the
deep
and
dreadful
harmony
of
manfred
to
fly
from
need
not
be
to
hate
mankind
all
are
not
fit
with
them
to
stir
and
toil
nor
is
it
discontent
to
keep
the
mind
deep
in
its
fountain
lest
it
overboil
in
the
hot
throng
where
we
become
the
spoil
of
our
infection
till
too
late
and
long
we
may
deplore
and
struggle
with
the
coil
in
wretched
interchange
of
wrong
for
wrong
a
contentious
world
striving
where
none
are
strong
there
in
a
moment
we
may
plunge
our
years
in
fatal
penitence
and
in
the
blight
of
our
own
soul
turn
all
our
blood
to
tears
and
colour
things
to
come
with
hues
of
night
the
race
of
life
becomes
a
hopeless
flight
to
those
who
walk
in
darkness
on
the
sea
the
boldest
steer
but
where
their
ports
invite
but
there
are
wanderers
eternity
whose
bark
drives
on
and
on
and
anchor
shall
be
these
sentiments
are
conceived
in
the
mood
of
an
awed
spirit
they
breathe
of
sorrow
and
penitence
of
the
weariness
of
satiety
the
pilgrim
no
more
complains
he
is
no
longer
despondent
from
exhaustion
and
the
lost
appetite
of
passion
but
from
the
weight
of
a
burden
which
he
can
not
lay
down
and
he
clings
to
visible
objects
as
if
from
their
nature
he
could
extract
a
moral
strength
i
live
not
in
myself
but
i
become
portion
of
that
around
me
and
to
me
high
mountains
are
a
feeling
but
the
hum
of
human
cities
tortures
i
can
see
nothing
to
loathe
in
nature
save
to
be
a
link
reluctant
in
a
fleshly
chain
class
among
creatures
where
the
soul
can
flee
and
with
the
sky
the
peak
the
heaving
plain
of
ocean
or
the
stars
mingle
and
not
in
vain
these
dim
revelations
of
black
and
lowering
thought
are
overshadowed
with
a
darker
hue
than
sorrow
alone
could
have
cast
a
consciousness
of
sinful
blame
is
evident
amid
them
and
though
the
fantasies
that
loom
through
the
mystery
are
not
so
hideous
as
the
guilty
reveries
in
the
weird
caldron
of
manfred
conscience
still
they
have
an
awful
resemblance
to
them
they
are
phantoms
of
the
same
murky
element
and
being
more
akin
to
fortitude
than
despair
prophesy
not
of
hereafter
but
oracularly
confess
suffering
manfred
himself
hath
given
vent
to
no
finer
horror
than
the
oracle
that
speaks
in
this
magnificent
stanza
i
have
not
loved
the
world
nor
the
world
me
i
have
not
flatter
its
rank
breath
nor
to
its
idolatries
a
patient
knee
nor
coin
my
cheek
to
smiles
nor
cried
aloud
in
worship
of
an
echo
in
the
crowd
they
could
not
deem
me
one
of
such
i
stood
among
them
but
not
of
them
in
a
shroud
of
thoughts
which
were
not
of
their
thoughts
and
still
could
had
i
not
filed
my
mind
which
thus
itself
subdued
there
are
times
in
life
when
all
men
feel
their
sympathies
extinct
and
lord
byron
was
evidently
in
that
condition
when
he
penned
these
remarkable
lines
but
independently
of
their
striking
beauty
the
scenery
in
which
they
were
conceived
deserves
to
be
considered
with
reference
to
the
sentiment
that
pervades
them
for
it
was
amid
the
same
obscure
ravines
precipices
and
falling
waters
of
the
alps
that
he
afterward
placed
the
outcast
manfred
an
additional
corroboration
of
the
justness
of
the
remarks
which
i
ventured
to
offer
in
adverting
to
his
ruminations
in
contemplating
while
yet
a
boy
the
malvern
hills
as
if
they
were
the
scenes
of
his
impassioned
childhood
in
the
palaces
of
nature
he
first
felt
the
consciousness
of
having
done
some
wrong
and
when
he
would
infuse
into
another
albeit
in
a
wilder
degree
the
feelings
he
had
himself
felt
he
recalled
the
images
which
had
ministered
to
the
cogitations
of
his
own
contrition
but
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
more
of
this
when
i
come
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
guilt
and
misery
of
manfred
that
manfred
is
the
greatest
of
byron
works
will
probably
not
be
disputed
it
has
more
than
the
fatal
mysticism
of
macbeth
with
the
satanic
grandeur
of
the
paradise
lost
and
the
hero
is
placed
in
circumstances
and
amid
scenes
which
accord
with
the
stupendous
features
of
his
preternatural
character
how
then
it
may
be
asked
does
this
moral
phantom
that
has
never
been
bear
any
resemblance
to
the
poet
himself
must
not
in
this
instance
the
hypothesis
which
assigns
to
byron
heroes
his
own
sentiments
and
feelings
be
abandoned
i
think
not
in
noticing
the
deep
and
solemn
reflections
with
which
he
was
affected
in
ascending
the
rhine
and
which
he
has
embodied
in
the
third
canto
of
childe
harold
i
have
already
pointed
out
a
similarity
in
the
tenour
of
the
thoughts
to
those
of
manfred
as
well
as
the
striking
acknowledgment
of
the
filed
mind
there
is
moreover
in
the
drama
the
same
distaste
of
the
world
which
byron
himself
expressed
when
cogitating
on
the
desolation
of
his
hearth
and
the
same
contempt
of
the
insufficiency
of
his
genius
and
renown
to
mitigate
contrition
all
in
strange
harmony
with
the
same
magnificent
objects
of
sight
is
not
the
opening
soliloquy
of
manfred
the
very
echo
of
the
reflections
on
the
rhine
my
slumbers
if
i
slumber
are
not
sleep
but
a
continuance
of
enduring
thought
which
then
i
can
resist
not
in
my
heart
there
is
a
vigil
and
these
eyes
but
close
to
look
within
and
yet
i
live
and
bear
the
aspect
and
the
form
of
breathing
man
but
the
following
is
more
impressive
it
is
the
very
phrase
he
would
himself
have
employed
to
have
spoken
of
the
consequences
of
his
fatal
marriage
my
in
juries
came
down
on
those
who
lov
me
on
those
whom
i
best
lov
i
never
an
enemy
save
in
my
just
defence
but
my
embrace
was
fatal
he
had
not
indeed
been
engaged
in
any
duel
of
which
the
issue
was
mortal
but
he
had
been
so
far
engaged
with
more
than
one
that
he
could
easily
conceive
what
it
would
have
been
to
have
quelled
an
enemy
in
just
defence
but
unless
the
reader
can
himself
discern
by
his
sympathies
that
there
is
the
resemblance
i
contend
for
it
is
of
no
use
to
multiply
instances
i
shall
therefore
give
but
one
other
extract
which
breathes
the
predominant
spirit
of
all
byron
sad
translation
of
the
preacher
vanity
of
vanities
all
is
vanity
look
on
me
there
is
an
order
of
mortals
on
the
earth
who
do
become
old
in
their
youth
and
die
ere
middle
age
without
the
violence
of
warlike
death
some
perishing
of
pleasure
some
of
study
some
worn
with
toil
some
of
mere
weariness
some
of
disease
and
some
insanity
and
some
of
wither
or
of
broken
hearts
for
this
last
is
a
malady
which
slays
more
than
are
number
in
the
lists
of
fate
taking
all
shapes
and
bearing
many
names
look
upon
me
for
even
of
all
these
things
have
i
partaken
and
of
all
these
things
one
were
enough
then
wonder
not
that
i
am
what
i
am
but
that
i
ever
was

been

i
am

not
on

similarity
between
sentiments
given
to
manfred
and
those
expressed
by
lord

in
his
own
person
the
account
given
by
captain
medwin
of
the
manner
in
which
lord
byron
spent
his
time
in
switzerland
has
the
raciness
of
his
lordship
own
quaintness
somewhat
diluted
the
reality
of
the
conversations
i
have
heard
questioned
but
they
relate
in
some
instances
to
matters
not
generally
known
to
the
truth
of
several
of
which
i
can
myself
bear
witness
moreover
they
have
much
of
the
poet
peculiar
modes
of
thinking
about
them
though
weakened
in
effect
by
the
reporter
no
man
can
give
a
just
representation
of
another
who
is
not
capable
of
putting
himself
into
the
character
of
his
original
and
of
thinking
with
his
power
and
intelligence
still
there
are
occasional
touches
of
merit
in
the
feeble
outlines
of
captain
medwin
and
with
this
conviction
it
would
be
negligence
not
to
avail
myself
of
them
switzerland
said
his
lordship
is
a
country
i
have
been
satisfied
with
seeing
once
turkey
i
could
live
in
for
ever
i
never
forget
my
predilections
i
was
in
a
wretched
state
of
health
and
worse
spirits
when
i
was
at
geneva
but
quiet
and
the
lake
better
physicians
than
polidori
soon
set
me
up
i
never
led
so
moral
a
life
as
during
my
residence
in
that
country
but
i
gained
no
credit
by
it
where
there
is
mortification
there
ought
to
be
reward
on
the
contrary
there
is
no
story
so
absurd
that
they
did
not
invent
at
my
cost
i
was
watched
by
glasses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
and
by
glasses
too
that
must
have
had
very
distorted
optics
i
was
waylaid
in
my
evening
drives
i
believe
they
looked
upon
me
as
a
i
knew
very
few
of
the
genevese
hentsh
was
very
civil
to
me
and
i
have
a
great
respect
for
sismondi
i
was
forced
to
return
the
civilities
of
one
of
their
professors
by
asking
him
and
an
old
gentleman
a
friend
of
gray
to
dine
with
me
i
had
gone
out
to
sail
early
in
the
morning
and
the
wind
prevented
me
from
returning
in
time
for
dinner
i
understand
that
i
offended
them
mortally
among
our
countrymen
i
made
no
new
acquaintances
shelley
monk
lewis
and
hobhouse
were
almost
the
only
english
people
i
saw
no
wonder
i
showed
a
distaste
for
society
at
that
time
and
went
little
among
the
genevese
besides
i
could
not
speak
french
when
i
went
the
tour
of
the
lake
with
shelley
and
hobhouse
the
boat
was
nearly
wrecked
near
the
very
spot
where
st
preux
and
julia
were
in
danger
of
being
drowned
it
would
have
been
classical
to
have
been
lost
there
but
not
agreeable
the
third
canto
of
childe
harold
manfred
and
the
prisoner
of
chillon
are
the
fruits
of
his
travels
up
the
rhine
and
of
his
sojourn
in
switzerland
of
the
first
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
more
but
the
following
extract
from
the
poet
travelling
has
been
supposed
to
contain
the
germ
of
the
tragedy
september
left
thun
in
a
boat
which
carried
us
the
length
of
the
lake
in
three
hours
the
lake
small
but
the
banks
fine
rocks
down
to
the
water
edge
landed
at
newhouse
passed
interlachen
entered
upon
a
range
of
scenes
beyond
all
description
or
previous
conception
passed
a
rock
bearing
an
inscription
two
brothers
one
murdered
the
other
just
the
place
for
it
after
a
variety
of
windings
came
to
an
enormous
rock
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
jungfrau
glaciers
torrents
one
of
these
nine
hundred
feet
visible
descent
lodge
at
the
curate
set
out
to
see
the
valley
heard
an
avalanche
fall
like
thunder
glaciers
enormous
storm
comes
on
thunder
and
lightning
and
hail
all
in
perfection
and
beautiful
the
torrent
is
in
shape
curving
over
the
rock
like
the
tail
of
the
white
horse
streaming
in
the
wind
just
as
might
be
conceived
would
be
that
of
the
pale
horse
on
which
death
is
mounted
in
the
apocalypse
it
is
neither
mist
nor
water
but
a
something
between
both
its
immense
height
gives
a
wave
a
curve
a
spreading
here
a
condensation
there
wonderful
indescribable
september
ascent
of
the
wingren
the
dent
shining
like
truth
on
one
side
on
the
other
the
clouds
rose
from
the
opposite
valley
curling
up
perpendicular
precipices
like
the
foam
of
the
ocean
of
hell
during
a
it
was
white
and
sulphury
and
immeasurably
deep
in
appearance
the
side
we
ascended
was
of
course
not
of
so
precipitous
a
nature
but
on
arriving
at
the
summit
we
looked
down
on
the
other
side
upon
a
boiling
sea
of
cloud
dashing
against
the
crag
on
which
we
stood
arrived
at
the
greenderwold
mounted
and
rode
to
the
higher
glacier
twilight
but
distinct
very
fine
glacier
like
a
frozen
hurricane
starlight
beautiful
the
whole
of
the
day
was
fine
and
in
point
of
weather
as
the
day
in
which
paradise
was
made
passed
whole
woods
of
withered
pines
all
withered
trunks
stripped
and
lifeless
done
by
a
single
winter
undoubtedly
in
these
brief
and
abrupt
but
masterly
touches
hints
for
the
scenery
of
manfred
may
be
discerned
but
i
can
perceive
nothing
in
them
which
bears
the
least
likelihood
to
their
having
influenced
the
conception
of
that
sublime
work
there
has
always
been
from
the
first
publication
of
manfred
a
strange
misapprehension
with
respect
to
it
in
the
public
mind
the
whole
poem
has
been
misunderstood
and
the
odious
supposition
that
ascribes
the
fearful
mystery
and
remorse
of
a
hero
to
a
foul
passion
for
his
sister
is
probably
one
of
those
coarse
imaginations
which
have
grown
out
of
the
calumnies
and
accusations
heaped
upon
the
author
how
can
it
have
happened
that
none
of
the
critics
have
noticed
that
the
story
is
derived
from
the
human
sacrifices
supposed
to
have
been

manfred
is
represented
as
being
actuated
by
an
insatiable
curiosity
a
passion
to
know
the
forbidden
secrets
of
the
world
the
scene
opens
with
him
at
his
midnight
studies
his
lamp
is
almost
burned
out
and
he
has
been
searching
for
knowledge
and
has
not
found
it
but
only
that
sorrow
is
knowledge
they
who
know
the
most
must
mourn
the
deepest
the
fatal
truth
the
tree
of
knowledge
is
not
that
of
life
philosophy
and
science
and
the
springs
of
wonder
and
the
wisdom
of
the
world
i
have
essayed
and
in
my
mind
there
is
a
power
to
make
these
subject
to
itself
he
is
engaged
in
calling
spirits
and
as
the
incantation
proceeds
they
obey
his
bidding
and
ask
him
what
he
wants

this
impressive
and
original
scene
prepares
the
reader
to
wonder
why
it
is
that
manfred
is
so
desirous
to
drink
of
lethe
he
has
acquired
dominion
over
spirits
and
he
finds
in
the
possession
of
the
power
that
knowledge
has
only
brought
him
sorrow
they
tell
him
he
is
immortal
and
what
he
suffers
is
as
inextinguishable
as
his
own
being
why
should
he
desire
forgetfulness
has
he
not
committed
a
great
secret
sin
what
is
it
he
alludes
to
his
sister
and
in
his
subsequent
interview
with
the
witch
we
gather
a
dreadful
meaning
concerning
her
fate
her
blood
has
been
shed
not
by
his
hand
nor
in
punishment
but
in
the
shadow
and
occultations
of
some
unutterable
crime
and
mystery
she
was
like
me
in
lineaments
her
eyes
her
hair
her
features
all
to
the
very
tone
even
of
her
voice
they
said
were
like
to
mine
but
soften
all
and
temper
into
beauty
she
had
the
same
lone
thoughts
and
wanderings
the
quest
of
hidden
knowledge
and
a
mind
to
comprehend
the
universe
nor
these
alone
but
with
them
gentler
powers
than
mine
pity
and
smiles
and
tears
which
i
had
not
and
tenderness
but
that
i
had
for
her
humility
and
that
i
never
had
her
faults
were
mine
her
virtues
were
her
own
i
lov
her
and
destroy
her
witch
with
thy
hand
manfred
not
with
my
hand
but
heart
which
broke
her
heart
it
gaz
on
mine
and
withered
i
have
shed
blood
but
not
hers
and
yet
her
blood
was
shed
i
saw
and
could
not
stanch
it
there
is
in
this
little
scene
perhaps
the
deepest
pathos
ever
expressed
but
it
is
not
of
its
beauty
that
i
am
treating
my
object
in
noticing
it
here
is
that
it
may
be
considered
in
connection
with
that
where
manfred
appears
with
his
insatiate
thirst
of
knowledge
and
manacled
with
guilt
it
indicates
that
his
sister
astarte
had
been
in
the
pursuit
of
their
magical
knowledge
human
sacrifices
were
supposed
to
be
among
the
initiate
propitiations
of
the
demons
that
have
their
purposes
in
magic
as
well
as
compacts
signed
with
the
blood
of
the
there
was
also
a
dark
egyptian
art
of
which
the
knowledge
and
the
efficacy
could
only
be
obtained
by
the
novitiate
procuring
a
voluntary
victim
the
dearest
object
to
himself
and
to
whom
he
also
was
the
dearest
and
the
primary
spring
of
byron
tragedy
lies
i
conceive
in
a
sacrifice
of
that
kind
having
been
performed
without
obtaining
that
happiness
which
the
votary
expected
would
be
found
in
the
knowledge
and
power
purchased
at
such
a
price
his
sister
was
sacrificed
in
vain
the
manner
of
the
sacrifice
is
not
divulged
but
it
is
darkly
intimated
to
have
been
done
amid
the
perturbations
of
something
horrible
night
after
night
for
years
he
hath
pursued
long
vigils
in
this
tower
without
a
i
have
been
within
it
so
have
we
all
been
ofttimes
but
from
it
or
its
contents
it
were
impossible
to
draw
conclusions
absolute
of
aught
his
studies
tend
to
be
sure
there
is
one
chamber
where
none
enter
count
manfred
was
as
now
within
his
tower
how
occupied
we
know
not
but
with
him
the
sole
companion
of
his
wanderings
and
watchings
her
whom
of
all
earthly
things
that
liv
the
only
thing
he
seem
to
love
with
admirable
taste
and
its
thrilling
augmentation
of
the
horror
the
poet
leaves
the
deed
which
was
done
in
that
unapproachable
chamber
undivulged
while
we
are
darkly
taught
that
within
it
lie
the
relics
or
the
ashes
of

beppo
lament
of
tasso
curious
example
of
byron
metaphysical
love
the
situation
of
lord
byron
in
switzerland
was
comfortless
he
found
that
the
montain
palaces
of
nature
afforded
no
asylum
to
a
haunted
heart
he
was
ill
at
ease
with
himself
even
dissatisfied
that
the
world
had
not
done
him
enough
of
wrong
to
justify
his
misanthropy
some
expectation
that
his
lady
would
repent
of
her
part
in
the
separation
probably
induced
him
to
linger
in
the
vicinity
of
geneva
the
thoroughfare
of
the
travelling
english
whom
he
affected
to
shun
if
it
were
so
he
was
disappointed
and
his
hopes
being
frustrated
he
broke
up
the
establishment
he
had
formed
there
and
crossed
the
alps
after
visiting
some
of
the
celebrated
scenes
and
places
in
the
north
of
italy
he
passed
on
to
venice
where
he
domiciled
himself
for
a
time
during
his
residence
at
venice
lord
byron
avoided
as
much
as
possible
any
intercourse
with
his
countrymen
this
was
perhaps
in
some
degree
necessary
and
it
was
natural
in
the
state
of
his
mind
he
had
become
an
object
of
great
public
interest
by
his
talents
the
stories
connected
with
his
domestic
troubles
had
also
increased
his
notoriety
and
in
such
circumstances
he
could
not
but
shrink
from
the
inquisition
of
mere
curiosity
but
there
was
an
insolence
in
the
tone
with
which
he
declares
his
utter
abhorrence
of
any
contact
with
the
travelling
english
that
can
neither
be
commended
for
its
spirit
nor
palliated
by
any
treatment
he
had
suffered
like
coriolanus
he
may
have
banished
his
country
but
he
had
not
like
the
roman
received
provocation
on
the
contrary
he
had
been
the
aggressor
in
the
feuds
with
his
literary
adversaries
and
there
was
a
serious
accusation
against
his
morals
or
at
least
his
manners
in
the
circumstances
under
which
lady
byron
withdrew
from
his
house
it
was
however
his
misfortune
throughout
life
to
form
a
wrong
estimate
of
himself
in
everything
save
in
his
poetical
powers
a
life
in
venice
is
more
monotonous
than
in
any
other
great
city
but
a
man
of
genius
carries
with
him
everywhere
a
charm
which
secures
to
him
both
variety
and
enjoyment
lord
byron
had
scarcely
taken
up
his
abode
in
venice
when
he
began
the
fourth
canto
of
childe
harold
which
he
published
early
in
the
following
year
and
dedicated
to
his
indefatigable
friend
mr
hobhouse
by
an
epistle
dated
on
the
anniversary
of
his
marriage
the
most
unfortunate
day
as
he
says
of
his
past
existence
in
this
canto
he
has
indulged
his
excursive
moralizing
beyond
even
the
wide
licence
he
took
in
the
three
preceding
parts
but
it
bears
the
impression
of
more
reading
and
observation
though
not
superior
in
poetical
energy
it
is
yet
a
higher
work
than
any
of
them
and
something
of
a
more
resolved
and
masculine
spirit
pervades
the
reflections
and
endows
as
it
were
with
thought
and
enthusiasm
the
aspect
of
the
things
described
of
the
merits
of
the
descriptions
as
of
real
things
i
am
not
qualified
to
judge
the
transcripts
from
the
tablets
of
the
author
bosom
he
has
himself
assured
us
are
faithful
with
regard
to
the
conduct
of
the
last
canto
there
will
be
found
less
of
the
pilgrim
than
in
any
of
the
preceding
and
that
little
slightly
if
at
all
separated
from
the
author
speaking
in
his
own
person
the
fact
is
that
i
had
become
weary
of
drawing
a
line
which
every
one
seemed
determined
not
to
perceive
like
the
chinese
in
goldsmith
citizen
of
the
world
whom
nobody
would
believe
to
be
a
chinese
it
was
in
vain
that
i
asserted
and
imagined
that
i
had
drawn
a
distinction
between
the
author
and
the
pilgrim
and
the
very
anxiety
to
preserve
this
difference
and
the
disappointment
at
finding
it
unavailing
so
far
crushed
my
efforts
in
the
composition
that
i
determined
to
abandon
it
altogether
and
have
done
so
this
confession
though
it
may
not
have
been
wanted
gives
a
pathetic
emphasis
to
those
passages
in
which
the
poet
speaks
of
his
own
feelings
that
his
mind
was
jarred
and
out
of
joint
there
is
too
much
reason
to
believe
but
he
had
in
some
measure
overcome
the
misery
that
clung
to
him
during
the
dismal
time
of
his
sojourn
in
switzerland
and
the
following
passage
though
breathing
the
sweet
and
melancholy
spirit
of
dejection
possesses
a
more
generous
vein
of
nationality
than
is
often
met
with
in
his
works
even
when
the
same
proud
sentiment
might
have
been
more
fitly
expressed
i
taught
me
other
tongues
and
in
strange
eyes
have
made
me
not
a
stranger
to
the
mind
which
is
itself
no
changes
bring
surprise
nor
is
it
harsh
to
make
or
hard
to
find
a
country
with
aye
or
without
mankind
yet
was
i
born
where
men
are
proud
to
be
not
without
cause
and
should
i
leave
behind
th
inviolate
island
of
the
sage
and
free
and
seek
me
out
a
home
by
a
remoter
sea
perhaps
i
lov
it
well
and
should
i
lay
my
ashes
in
a
soil
which
is
not
mine
my
spirit
shall
resume
it
if
we
may
unbodied
choose
a
sanctuary
i
twine
my
hopes
of
being
remember
in
my
line
with
my
land
language
if
too
fond
and
far
these
aspirations
in
their
hope
incline
if
my
fame
should
be
as
my
fortunes
are
of
hasty
growth
and
blight
and
dull
oblivion
bar
my
name
from
out
the
temple
where
the
dead
are
honour
by
the
nations
let
it
be
and
light
the
laurels
on
a
loftier
head
and
be
the
spartan
epitaph
on
me
sparta
had
many
a
worthier
son
than
he
meantime
i
seek
no
sympathies
nor
need
the
thorns
which
i
have
reap
are
of
the
tree
i
planted
they
have
torn
me
and
i
bleed
i
should
have
known
what
fruit
would
spring
from
such
a
seed
it
will
strike
the
reader
as
remarkable
that
although
the
poet
in
the
course
of
this
canto
takes
occasion
to
allude
to
dante
and
tasso
in
whose
destinies
there
was
a
shadowy
likeness
of
his
own
the
rumination
is
mingled
with
less
of
himself
than
might
have
been
expected
especially
when
it
is
considered
how
much
it
was
a
habit
with
him
to
make
his
own
feelings
the
basis
and
substratum
of
the
sentiments
he
ascribed
to
others
it
has
also
more
than
once
surprised
me
that
he
has
so
seldom
alluded
to
alfieri
whom
of
all
poets
both
in
character
and
conduct
he
most
resembled
with
this
difference
however
that
alfieri
was
possessed
of
affections
equally
intense
and
durable
whereas
the
caprice
of
byron
made
him
uncertain
in
his
partialities
or
what
was
the
same
in
effect
made
his
friends
set
less
value
on
them
than
perhaps
they
were
entitled
to
before
childe
harold
was
finished
an
incident
occurred
which
suggested
to
byron
a
poem
of
a
very
different
kind
to
any
he
had
yet
attempted
without
vouching
for
the
exact
truth
of
the
anecdote
i
have
been
told
that
he
one
day
received
by
the
mail
a
copy
of
whistlecraft
prospectus
and
specimen
of
an
intended
national
work
and
moved
by
its
playfulness
immediately
after
reading
it
began
beppo
which
he
finished
at
a
sitting
the
facility
with
which
he
composed
renders
the
story
not
improbable
but
singular
as
it
may
seem
the
poem
itself
has
the
facetious
flavour
in
it
of
his
gaiety
stronger
than
even
his
grave
works
have
of
his
frowardness
commonly
believed
to
have
been
i
think
unjustly
the
predominant
mood
of
his
character
the
ode
to
venice
is
also
to
be
numbered
among
his
compositions
in
that
city
a
spirited
and
indignant
effusion
full
of
his
peculiar
lurid
fire
and
rich
in
a
variety
of
impressive
and
original
images
but
there
is
a
still
finer
poem
which
belongs
to
this
period
of
his
history
though
written
i
believe
before
he
reached
venice
the
lament
of
tasso
and
i
am
led
to
notice
it
the
more
particularly
as
one
of
its
noblest
passages
affords
an
illustration
of
the
opinion
which
i
have
early
maintained
that
lord
byron
extraordinary
pretensions
to
the
influence
of
love
was
but
a
metaphysical
conception
of
the
passion
it
is
no
marvel
from
my
very
birth
my
soul
was
drunk
with
love
which
did
pervade
and
mingle
with
i
saw
on
earth
of
objects
all
inanimate
i
made
idols
and
out
of
wild
and
lovely
flowers
and
rocks
whereby
they
grew
a
paradise
where
i
did
lay
me
down
within
the
shade
of
waving
trees
and
dream
uncounted
hours
it
has
been
remarked
by
an
anonymous
author
of
memoirs
of
lord
byron
a
work
written
with
considerable
talent
and
acumen
that
this
is
so
far
from
being
in
character
that
it
is
the
very
reverse
for
whether
tasso
was
in
his
senses
or
not
if
his
love
was
sincere
he
would
have
made
the
object
of
his
affection
the
sole
theme
of
his
meditation
instead
of
generalising
his
passion
and
talking
about
the
original
sympathies
of
his
nature
in
truth
no
poet
has
better
described
love
than
byron
has
his
own
peculiar
passion
his
love
was
passion
essence
as
a
tree
on
fire
by
lightning
with
ethereal
flame
kindled
he
was
and
blasted
for
to
be
thus
enamour
were
in
him
the
same
but
his
was
not
the
love
of
living
dame
nor
of
the
dead
who
rise
upon
our
dreams
but
of
ideal
beauty
which
became
in
him
existence
and
teems
along
his
burning
page
distemper
though
it
seems
in
tracing
the
course
of
lord
byron
career
i
have
not
deemed
it
at
all
necessary
to
advert
to
the
instances
of
his
generosity
or
to
conduct
less
pleasant
to
record
enough
has
appeared
to
show
that
he
was
neither
deficient
in
warmth
of
heart
nor
in
less
amiable
feelings
but
upon
the
whole
it
is
not
probable
that
either
in
his
charities
or
his
pleasures
he
was
greatly
different

he
undoubtedly
had
a
wayward
delight
in
magnifying
his
excesses

in

more
notoriety
has
been

to
an
instance
of
lavish
liberality
at
venice
than
the
case
deserved
though
it
was
unquestionably
prompted
by
a
charitable
impulse
the
house
of
a
shoemaker
near
his
lordship
residence
in
st
samuel
was
burned
to
the
ground
with
all
it
contained
by
which
the
proprietor
was
reduced
to
indigence
byron
not
only
caused
a
new
but
a
superior
house
to
be
erected
and
also
presented
the
sufferer
with
a
sum
of
money
equal
in
value
to
the
whole
of
his
stock
in

i

removes
to
ravenna
the
countess
guiccioli
although
lord
byron
resided
between
two
and
three
years
at
venice
he
was
never
much
attached
to
it
to
see
a
city
die
daily
as
she
does
said
he
is
a
sad
contemplation
i
sought
to
distract
my
mind
from
a
sense
of
her
desolation
and
my
own
solitude
by
plunging
into
a
vortex
that
was
anything
but
pleasure
when
one
gets
into
a
it
is
difficult
to
swim
against
it
and
keep
out
of
the
wheels
he
became
tired
and
disgusted
with
the
life
he
led
at
venice
and
was
glad
to
turn
his
back
on
it
about
the
close
of
the
year
he
accordingly
removed
to
ravenna
but
before
i
proceed
to
speak
of
the
works
which
he
composed
at
ravenna
it
is
necessary
to
explain
some
particulars
respecting
a
personal
affair
the
influence
of
which
on
at
least
one
of
his
productions
is
as
striking
as
any
of
the
many
instances
already
described
upon
others
i
allude
to
the
intimacy
which
he
formed
with
the
young
countess
guiccioli
this
lady
at
the
age
of
sixteen
was
married
to
the
count
one
of
the
richest
noblemen
in
romagna
but
far
advanced
in
life
from
the
first
said
lord
byron
in
his
account
of
her
they
had
separate
apartments
and
she
always
called
him
sir
what
could
be
expected
from
such
a
preposterous
connection
for
some
time
she
was
an
angiolina
and
he
a
marino
faliero
a
good
old
man
but
young
italian
women
are
not
satisfied
with
good
old
men
and
the
venerable
count
did
not
object
to
her
availing
herself
of
the
privileges
of
her
country
in
selecting
a
cicisbeo
an
italian
would
have
made
it
quite
agreeable
indeed
for
some
time
he
winked
at
our
intimacy
but
at
length
made
an
exception
against
me
as
a
foreigner
a
heretic
an
englishman
and
what
was
worse
than
all
a
liberal
he
insisted
teresa
was
as
obstinate
her
family
took
her
part
catholics
can
not
get
divorces
but
to
the
scandal
of
all
romagna
the
matter
was
at
last
referred
to
the
pope
who
ordered
her
a
separate
maintenance
on
condition
that
she
should
reside
under
her
roof
all
this
was
not
agreeable
and
at
length
i
was
forced
to
smuggle
her
out
of
ravenna
having
discovered
a
plot
laid
with
the
sanction
of
the
legate
for
shutting
her
up
in
a
convent
for
life
the
countess
guiccioli
was
at
this
time
about
twenty
but
she
appeared
younger
her
complexion
was
fair
with
large
dark
languishing
eyes
and
her
auburn
hair
fell
in
great
profusion
of
natural
ringlets
over
her
shapely
shoulders
her
features
were
not
so
regular
as
in
their
expression
pleasing
and
there
was
an
amiable
gentleness
in
her
voice
which
was
peculiarly
interesting
leigh
hunt
account
of
her
is
not
essentially
dissimilar
from
any
other
that
i
have
either
heard
of
or
met
with
he
differs
however
in
one
respect
from
every
other
in
saying
that
her
hair
was
yellow
but
considering
the
curiosity
which
this
young
lady
has
excited
perhaps
it
may
be
as
well
to
transcribe
his
description
at
length
especially
as
he
appears
to
have
taken
some
pains
on
it
and
more
particularly
as
her
destiny
seems
at
present
to
promise
that
the
interest
for
her
is
likely
to
be
revived
by
another
unhappy
english
connection
her
appearance
says
mr
hunt
might
have
reminded
an
english
spectator
of
chaucer
heroine
yclothed
was
she
fresh
for
to
devise
her
yellow
hair
was
braided
in
a
tress
behind
her
back
a
yarde
long
i
guess
and
in
the
garden
as
the
same
uprist
she
walketh
up
and
down
where
as
her
list
and
then
as
dryden
has
it
at
every
turn
she
made
a
little
stand
and
thrust
among
the
thorns
her
lily
hand
madame
guiccioli
who
was
at
that
time
about
twenty
was
handsome
and
with
an
agreeable
manner
and
a
voice
not
partaking
too
much
of
the
italian
fervour
to
be
gentle
she
had
just
enough
of
it
to
give
her
speaking
a
grace
none
of
her
graces
appeared
entirely
free
from
art
nor
on
the
other
hand
did
they
betray
enough
of
it
to
give
you
an
ill
opinion
of
her
sincerity
and
her
hair
was
what
the
poet
has
described
or
rather
blond
with
an
inclination
to
yellow
a
very
fair
and
delicate
yellow
at
all
events
and
within
the
limits
of
the
poetical
she
had
regular
features
of
the
order
properly
called
handsome
in
distinction
to
prettiness
or
piquancy
being
well
proportioned
to
one
another
large
rather
than
otherwise
but
without
coarseness
and
more
harmonious
than
interesting
her
nose
was
the
handsomest
of
the
kind
i
ever
saw
and
i
have
known
her
both
smile
very
sweetly
and
look
intelligently
when
lord
byron
has
said
something
kind
to
her
i
should
not
say
however
that
she
was
a
very
intelligent
person
both
her
wisdom
and
her
want
of
wisdom
were
on
the
side
of
her
feelings
in
which
there
was
doubtless
mingled
a
good
deal
of
the
natural
to
a
flattered
beauty
in
a
word
madame
guiccioli
was
a
kind
of
buxom
compressing
herself
artificially
into
dignity
and
elegance
and
fancying
she
walked
in
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
a
heroine
by
the
side
of
a
poet
when
i
saw
her
at
monte
nero
near
leghorn
she
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
and
exultation
and
had
really
something
of
this
look
at
that
time
also
she
looked
no
older
than
she
was
in
which
respect
a
rapid
and
very
singular
change
took
place
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
she
seemed
to
have
lived
as
many
years
this
is
not
very
perspicuous
portraiture
nor
does
it
show
that
mr
hunt
was
a
very
discerning
observer
of
character
lord
byron
himself
is
represented
to
have
said
that
extraordinary
pains
were
taken
with
her
education
her
conversation
is
lively
without
being
frivolous
without
being
learned
she
has
read
all
the
best
authors
of
her
own
and
the
french
language
she
often
conceals
what
she
knows
from
the
fear
of
being
thought
to
know
too
much
possibly
because
she
knows
i
am
not
fond
of
blues
to
use
an
expression
of
jeffrey
she
has
blue
stockings
she
contrives
that
her
petticoats
shall
hide
them
lord
byron
was
at
one
time
much
attached
to
her
nor
could
it
be
doubted
that
their
affection
was
reciprocal
but
in
both
their
union
outlived
their
affection
for
before
his
departure
to
greece
his
attachment
had
perished
and
he
left
her
as
it
is
said
notwithstanding
the
rank
and
opulence
she
had
forsaken
on
his
account
without
any
provision
he
had
promised
it
was
reported
to
settle
two
thousand
pounds
on
her
but
he
forgot
the
intention
or
died
before
it
was
carried
into
effect
on
her
part
the
estrangement
was
of
a
different
and
curious
kind
she
had
not
come
to
hate
him
but
she
told
a
lady
the
friend
of
a
mutual
acquaintance
of
lord
byron
and
mine
that
she
feared
more
than
loved
him

it
is

that
out
of

you
will
find

there
will

who
like

can

found
also
at
ravenna
much
education
and
liberality
of
thinking
among
the
higher
classes
the
climate
is
delightful
i
was
not
broken

there
is
something
inspiring
in
such
an
air
the
people
liked
me
as
much
as
they
hated
the
government
it
is
not
a
little
to
say
i
was
popular
with
all
the
leaders
of
the
constitutional
party
they
knew
that
i
came
from
a
land
of
liberty
and
wished
well
to
their
cause
i
would
have
espoused
it
too
and
assisted
them
to
shake
off
their
fetters
they
knew
my
character
for
i
had
been
living
two
years
at
venice
where
many
of
the
ravennese
have
houses
i
did
not
however
take
part
in
their
intrigues
nor
join
in
their
political
coteries
but
i
had
a
magazine
of
one
hundred
stand
of
arms
in
the
house
when
everything
was
ripe
for
revolt
a
curse
on
carignan
imbecility
i
could
have
pardoned
him
that
too
if
he
had
not
impeached
his
partisans
the
proscription
was
immense
in
romagna
and
embraced
many
of
the
first
nobles
almost
all
my
friends
among
the
rest
the
gambas
the
father
and
brother
of
the
countess
guiccioli
who
took
no
part
in
the
affair
were
included
in
it
they
were
exiled
and
their
possessions
confiscated
they
knew
that
this
must
eventually
drive
me
out
of
the
country
i
did
not
follow
them
immediately
i
was
not
to
be
bullied
i
had
myself
fallen
under
the
eye
of
the
government
if
they
could
have
got
sufficient
proof
they
would
have
arrested
me
the
latter
part
of
this
declaration
bears
in
my
opinion
indubitable
marks
of
being
genuine
it
has
that
magnifying
mysticism
about
it
which
more
than
any
other
quality
characterized
lord
intimations
concerning
himself
and
his
own
affairs
but
it
is
a
little
clearer
than
i
should
have
expected
in
the
acknowledgment
of
the
part
he
was
preparing
to
take
in
the
insurrection
he
does
not
seem
here
to
be
sensible
that
in
confessing
so
much
he
has
justified
the
jealousy
with
which
he
was
regarded
shortly
after
the
plot
was
discovered
he
proceeds
to
say
i
received
several
anonymous
letters
advising
me
to
discontinue
my
forest
rides
but
i
entertained
no
apprehensions
of
treachery
and
was
more
on
horseback
than
ever
i
never
stir
out
without
being
well
armed
nor
sleep
without
pistols
they
knew
that
i
never
missed
my
aim
perhaps
this
saved
me
an
event
occurred
at
this
time
at
ravenna
that
made
a
deep
impression
on
lord
byron
the
commandant
of
the
place
who
though
suspected
of
being
secretly
a
carbonaro
was
too
powerful
a
man
to
be
arrested
was
assassinated
opposite
to
his
residence
the
measures
adopted
to
screen
the
murderer
proved
in
the
opinion
of
his
lordship
that
the
assassination
had
taken
place
by
order
of
the
police
and
that
the
spot
where
it
was
perpetrated
had
been
selected
by
choice
byron
at
the
moment
had
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
his
horse
started
at
the
report
of
the
shot
on
looking
round
he
saw
a
man
throw
down
a
carbine
and
run
away
and
another
stretched
on
the
pavement
near
him
on
hastening
to
the
spot
he
found
it
was
the
commandant
a
crowd
collected
but
no
one
offered
any
assistance
his
lordship
directed
his
servant
to
lift
the
bleeding
body
into
the
palace
he
assisted
himself
in
the
act
though
it
was
represented
to
him
that
he
might
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
government
and
the
gentleman
was
already
dead
his
adjutant
followed
the
body
into
the
house
i
remember
says
his
lordship
his
lamentation
over
him
devil
he
would
not
have
harmed
a
dog
it
was
from
the
murder
of
this
commandant
that
the
poet
sketched
the
scene
of
the
assassination
in
the
fifth
canto
of
don
juan
the
other
evening
was
on
friday
last
this
is
a
fact
and
no
poetic
fable
just
as
my
great
coat
was
about
me
cast
my
hat
and
gloves
still
lying
on
the
table
i
heard
a
shot
was
eight
scarce
past
and
running
out
as
fast
as
i
was
able
i
found
the
military
commandant
stretch
in
the
street
and
able
scarce
to
pant
poor
fellow
for
some
reason
surely
bad
they
had
him
slain
with
five
slugs
and
left
him
there
to
perish
on
the
pavement
so
i
had
him
borne
into
the
house
and
up
the
stair
the
man
was
gone
in
some
italian
quarrel
kill
by
five
bullets
from
an
old
the
scars
of
his
old
wounds
were
near
his
new
those
honourable
scars
which
bought
him
fame
and
horrid
was
the
contrast
to
the
view
but
let
me
quit
the
theme
as
such
things
claim
perhaps
more
attention
than
is
due
from
me
i
gazed
as
oft
i
gazed
the
same
to
try
if
i
could
wrench
aught
out
of
death
which
should
confirm
or
shake
or
make
a
faith
whether
marino
faliero
was
written
at
ravenna
or
completed
there
i
have
not
ascertained
but
it
was
planned
at
venice
and
as
far
back
as
i
believe
this
is
considered
about
the
most
ordinary
performance
of
all
lord
byron
works
but
if
it
is
considered
with
reference
to
the
time
in
which
it
was
written
it
will
probably
be
found
to
contain
many
great
and
impressive
passages
has
not
the
latter
part
of
the
second
scene
in
the
first
act
reference
to
the
condition
of
venice
when
his
lordship
was
there
and
is
not
the
description
which
israel
bertuccio
gives
of
the
conspirators
applicable
to
as
it
was
probably
derived
from
the
carbonari
with
whom
there
is
reason
to
say
byron
was
himself
disposed
to
take
a
part
know
then
that
there
are
met
and
sworn
in
secret
a
band
of
brethren
valiant
hearts
and
true
men
who
have
proved
all
fortunes
and
have
long
grieved
over
that
of
venice
and
have
right
to
do
so
having
served
her
in
all
climes
and
having
rescued
her
from
foreign
foes
would
do
the
same
for
those
within
her
walls
they
are
not
numerous
nor
yet
too
few
for
their
great
purpose
they
have
arms
and
means
and
hearts
and
hopes
and
faith
and
patient
courage
this
drama
to
be
properly
appreciated
both
in
its
taste
and
feeling
should
be
considered
as
addressed
to
the
italians
of
the
epoch
at
which
it
was
written
had
it
been
written
in
the
italian
instead
of
the
english
language
and
could
have
come
out
in
any
city
of
italy
the
effect
would
have
been
prodigious
it
is
indeed
a
work
not
to
be
estimated
by
the
delineations
of
character
nor
the
force
of
passion
expressed
in
it
but
altogether
by
the
apt
and
searching
sarcasm
of
the
political
allusions
viewed
with
reference
to
the
time
and
place
in
which
it
was
composed
it
would
probably
deserve
to
be
ranked
as
a
high
and
bold
effort
simply
as
a
drama
it
may
not
be
entitled
to
rank
above
tragedies
of
the
second
or
third
class
but
i
mean
not
to
set
my
opinion
of
this
work
against
that
of
the
public
the
english
public
all
i
contend
for
is
that
it
possesses
many
passages
of
uncommon
beauty
and
that
its
chief
tragic
merit
consists
in
its
political
indignation
but
above
all
that
is
another
and
a
strong
proof
too
of
what
i
have
been
endeavouring
to
show
that
the
power
of
the
poet
consisted
in
giving
vent
to
his
own
feelings
and
not
like
his
great
brethren
or
even
his
less
in
the
invention
of
situations
or
of
appropriate
sentiments
it
is
perhaps
as
it
stands
not
fit
to
succeed
in
representation
but
it
is
so
rich
in
matter
that
it
would
not
be
a
difficult
task
to
make
out
of
little
more
than
the
third
part
a
tragedy
which
would
not
dishonour
the
english
stage
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
why
it
has
been
so
often
supposed
that
lord
byron
was
actuated
in
the
composition
of
his
different
works
by
any
other
motive
than
enjoyment
perhaps
no
poet
had
ever
less
of
an
ulterior
purpose
in
his
mind
during
the
fits
of
inspiration
for
the
epithet
may
be
applied
correctly
to
him
and
to
the
moods
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
write
than
this
singular
and
impassioned
man
those
who
imagine
that
he
had
any
intention
to
impair
the
reverence
due
to
religion
or
to
weaken
the
hinges
of
moral
action
give
him
credit
for
far
more
design
and
prospective
purpose
than
he
possessed
they
could
have
known
nothing
of
the
man
the
main
defect
of
whose
character
in
relation
to
everything
was
in
having
too
little
of
the
element
or
principle
of
purpose
he
was
a
thing
of
impulses
and
to
judge
of
what
he
either
said
or
did
as
the
results
of
predetermination
was
not
only
to
do
the
harshest
injustice
but
to
show
a
total
ignorance
of
his
character
his
whole
fault
the
darkest
course
of
those
flights
and
deviations
from
propriety
which
have
drawn
upon
him
the
severest
animadversion
lay
in
the
unbridled
state
of
his
impulses
he
felt
but
never
reasoned
i
am
led
to
make
these
observations
by
noticing
the
ungracious
or
more
justly
the
illiberal
spirit
in
which
the
prophecy
of
dante
which
was
published
with
the
marino
faliero
has
been
treated
by
the
anonymous
author
of
memoirs
of
the
life
and
writings
of
lord
byron
of
the
prophecy
of
dante
i
am
no
particular
admirer
it
contains
unquestionably
stanzas
of
resounding
energy
but
the
general
verse
of
the
poem
is
as
harsh
and
abrupt
as
the
clink
and
clang
of
the
cymbal
moreover
even
for
a
prophecy
it
is
too
obscure
and
though
it
possesses
abstractedly
too
many
fine
thoughts
and
too
much
of
the
combustion
of
heroic
passion
to
be
regarded
as
a
failure
yet
it
will
never
be
popular
it
is
a
quarry
however
of
very
precious
poetical
expression
it
was
written
at
ravenna
and
at
the
suggestion
of
the
guiccioli
to
whom
it
is
dedicated
in
a
sonnet
prettily
but
inharmoniously
turned
like
all
his
other
best
performances
this
rugged
but
masterly
composition
draws
its
highest
interest
from
himself
and
his
own
feelings
and
can
only
be
rightly
appreciated
by
observing
how
fitly
many
of
the
bitter
breathings
of
dante
apply
to
his
own
exiled
and
outcast
condition
for
however
much
he
was
himself
the
author
of
his
own
banishment
he
felt
when
he
wrote
these
haughty
verses
that
he
had
been
sometimes
shunned
chapter
xxxvi
the
tragedy
of
sardanapalus
considered
with
reference
to
lord
byron
own
circumstances
cain
among
the
mental
enjoyments
which
endeared
ravenna
to
lord
byron
the
composition
of
sardanapalus
may
be
reckoned
the
chief
it
seems
to
have
been
conceived
in
a
happier
mood
than
any
of
all
his
other
works
for
even
while
it
inculcates
the
dangers
of
voluptuous
indulgence
it
breathes
the
very
essence
of
benevolence
and
philosophy
pleasure
takes
so
much
of
the
character
of
virtue
in
it
that
but
for
the
moral
taught
by
the
consequences
enjoyment
might
be
mistaken
for
duty
i
have
never
been
able
to
satisfy
myself
in
what
the
resemblance
consists
but
from
the
first
reading
it
has
always
appeared
to
me
that
there
was
some
elegant
similarity
between
the
characters
of
sardanapalus
and
hamlet
and
my
inclination
has
sometimes
led
me
to
imagine
that
the
former
was
the
nobler
conception
of
the
two
the
assyrian
monarch
like
the
prince
of
denmark
is
highly
endowed
capable
of
the
greatest
undertakings
he
is
yet
softened
by
a
philosophic
indolence
of
nature
that
makes
him
undervalue
the
enterprises
of
ambition
and
all
those
objects
in
the
attainment
of
which
so
much
of
glory
is
supposed
to
consist
they
are
both
alike
incapable
of
rousing
themselves
from
the
fond
reveries
of
moral
theory
even
when
the
strongest
motives
are
presented
to
them
hamlet
hesitates
to
act
though
his
father
spirit
hath
come
from
death
to
incite
him
and
sardanapalus
derides
the
achievements
that
had
raised
his
ancestors
to
an
equality
with
the
gods
thou
wouldst
have
me
go
forth
as
a
by
all
the
stars
which
the
chaldeans
read
the
restless
slaves
deserve
that
i
should
curse
them
with
their
wishes
and
lead
them
forth
to
glory
again
the
ungrateful
and
ungracious
slaves
they
murmur
because
i
have
not
shed
their
blood
nor
led
them
to
dry
into
the
deserts
dust
by
myriads
or
whiten
with
their
bones
the
banks
of
ganges
nor
decimated
them
with
savage
laws
nor
sweated
them
to
build
up
pyramids
or
babylonian
walls
the
nothingness
of
kingly
greatness
and
national
pride
were
never
before
so
finely
contemned
as
by
the
voluptuous
assyrian
and
were
the
scorn
not
mitigated
by
the
skilful
intermixture
of
mercifulness
and
philanthropy
the
character
would
not
be
endurable
but
when
the
same
voice
which
pronounced
contempt
on
the
toils
of
honour
says
enough
for
me
if
i
can
make
my
subjects
feel
the
weight
of
human
misery
less
it
is
impossible
to
repress
the
liking
which
the
humane
spirit
of
that
thought
is
calculated
to
inspire
nor
is
there
any
want
of
dignity
in
sardanapalus
even
when
lolling
softest
in
his
luxury
must
i
consume
my
life
this
little
life
in
guarding
against
all
may
make
it
less
it
is
not
worth
so
much
it
were
to
die
before
my
hour
to
live
in
dread
of
death
till
now
no
drop
of
an
assyrian
vein
hath
flow
for
me
nor
hath
the
smallest
coin
of
nineveh
vast
treasure
been
on
objects
which
could
cost
her
sons
a
tear
if
then
they
hate
me
is
because
i
hate
not
if
they
rebel
is
because
i
oppress
not
this
is
imagined
in
the
true
tone
of
epicurean
virtue
and
it
rises
to
magnanimity
when
he
adds
in
compassionate
scorn
oh
men
ye
must
be
ruled
with
scythes
not
sceptres
and
mow
down
like
the
grass
else
all
we
reap
is
rank
abundance
and
a
rotten
harvest
of
discontents
infecting
the
fair
soil
making
a
desert
of
fertility
but
the
graciousness
in
the
conception
of
the
character
of
sardanapalus
is
not
to
be
found
only
in
these
sentiments
of
his
meditations
but
in
all
and
every
situation
in
which
the
character
is
placed
when
salamenes
bids
him
not
sheath
his
sword
the
sole
sceptre
left
you
now
with
safety
the
king
replies
a
heavy
one
and
subjoins
as
if
to
conceal
his
distaste
for
war
by
ascribing
a
dislike
to
the
sword
itself
the
hilt
too
hurts
my
hand
it
may
be
asked
why
i
dwell
so
particularly
on
the
character
of
sardanapalus
it
is
admitted
that
he
is
the
most
heroic
of
voluptuaries
the
most
philosophical
of
the
licentious
the
first
he
is
undoubtedly
but
he
is
not
licentious
and
in
omitting
to
make
him
so
the
poet
has
prevented
his
readers
from
disliking
his
character
upon
principle
it
was
a
skilful
stroke
of
art
to
do
this
had
it
been
otherwise
and
had
there
been
no
affection
shown
for
the
ionian
slave
sardanapalus
would
have
engaged
no
sympathy
it
is
not
however
with
respect
to
the
ability
with
which
the
character
has
been
imagined
nor
to
the
poetry
with
which
it
is
invested
that
i
have
so
particularly
made
it
a
subject
of
criticism
it
was
to
point
out
how
much
in
it
lord
byron
has
interwoven
of
his
own
best
nature
at
the
time
when
he
was
occupied
with
this
great
work
he
was
confessedly
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
happiest
portion
of
his
life
the
guiccioli
was
to
him
a
myrrha
but
the
carbonari
were
around
and
in
the
controversy
in
which
sardanapalus
is
engaged
between
the
obligations
of
his
royalty
and
his
inclinations
for
pleasure
we
have
a
vivid
insight
of
the
cogitation
of
the
poet
whether
to
take
a
part
in
the
hazardous
activity
which
they
were
preparing
or
to
remain
in
the
seclusion
and
festal
repose
of
which
he
was
then
in
possession
the
assyrian
is
as
much
lord
byron
as
childe
harold
was
and
bears
his
lineaments
in
as
clear
a
likeness
as
a
voluptuary
unsated
could
do
those
of
the
emaciated
victim
of
satiety
over
the
whole
drama
and
especially
in
some
of
the
speeches
of
sardanapalus
a
great
deal
of
fine
but
irrelevant
poetry
and
moral
reflection
has
been
profusely
spread
but
were
the
piece
adapted
to
the
stage
these
portions
would
of
course
be
omitted
and
the
character
denuded
of
them
would
then
more
fully
justify
the
idea
which
i
have
formed
of
it
than
it
may
perhaps
to
many
readers
do
at
present
hidden
as
it
is
both
in
shape
and
contour
under
an
excess
of
ornament
that
the
character
of
myrrha
was
also
drawn
from
life
and
that
the
guiccioli
was
the
model
i
have
no
doubt
she
had
when
most
enchanted
by
her
passion
for
byron
at
the
very
time
when
the
drama
was
written
many
sources
of
regret
and
he
was
too
keen
an
observer
and
of
too
jealous
a
nature
not
to
have
marked
every
shade
of
change
in
her
appearance
and
her
every
moment
of
melancholy
reminiscence
so
that
even
though
she
might
never
have
given
expression
to
her
sentiments
still
such
was
her
situation
that
it
could
not
but
furnish
him
with
fit
suggestions
from
which
to
fill
up
the
moral
being
of
the
ionian
slave
were
the
character
of
myrrha
scanned
with
this
reference
while
nothing
could
be
discovered
to
detract
from
the
value
of
the
composition
a
great
deal
would
be
found
to
lessen
the
merit
of
the
poet
invention
he
had
with
him
the
very
being
in
person
whom
he
has
depicted
in
the
drama
of
dispositions
and
endowments
greatly
similar
and
in
circumstances
in
which
she
could
not
but
feel
as
myrrha
is
supposed
to
have
felt
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
has
applied
the
good
fortune
of
that
incident
to
a
beautiful
purpose
this
however
is
not
all
that
the
tragedy
possesses
of
the
author
the
character
of
zarina
is
perhaps
even
still
more
strikingly
drawn
from
life
there
are
many
touches
in
the
scene
with
her
which
he
could
not
have
imagined
without
thinking
of
his
own
domestic
disasters
the
first
sentiment
she
utters
is
truly
conceived
in
the
very
frame
and
temper
in
which
byron
must
have
wished
his
lady
to
think
of
himself
and
he
could
not
embody
it
without
feeling
that
how
many
a
year
has
pass
though
we
are
still
so
young
since
we
have
met
which
i
have
borne
in
widowhood
of
heart
the
following
delicate
expression
has
reference
to
his
having
left
his
daughter
with
her
mother
and
unfolds
more
of
his
secret
feelings
on
the
subject
than
anything
he
has
expressed
more
ostentatiously
elsewhere
i
wish
to
thank
you
that
you
have
not
divided
my
heart
from
all
that
left
it
now
to
love
and
what
sardanapalus
says
of
his
children
is
not
less
applicable
to
byron
and
is
true
deem
not
i
have
not
done
you
justice
rather
make
them
resemble
your
own
line
than
their
own
sire
i
trust
them
with
you
to
you
and
when
zarina
says
they
shall
know
from
me
aught
but
what
may
honour
their
father
memory
he
puts
in
her
mouth
only
a
sentiment
which
he
knew
if
his
wife
never
expressed
to
him
she
profoundly
acknowledged
in
resolution
to
herself
the
whole
of
this
scene
is
full
of
the
most
penetrating
pathos
and
did
the
drama
not
contain
in
every
page
indubitable
evidence
to
me
that
he
has
shadowed
out
in
it
himself
his
wife
and
his
mistress
this
little
interview
would
prove
a
vast
deal
in
confirmation
of
the
opinion
so
often
expressed
that
where
his
genius
was
most
in
its
element
it
was
when
it
dealt
with
his
own
sensibilities
and
circumstances
it
is
impossible
to
read
the
following
speech
without
a
conviction
that
it
was
written
at
lady
byron
my
gentle
wrong
zarina
i
am
the
very
slave
of
circumstance
and
impulse
borne
away
with
every
breath
misplaced
upon
the
throne
misplaced
in
life
i
know
not
what
i
could
have
been
but
feel
i
am
not
what
i
should
be
let
it
end
but
take
this
with
thee
if
i
was
not
to
prize
a
love
like
thine
a
mind
like
thine
nor
dote
even
on
thy
beauty
as
i
doted
on
lesser
charms
for
no
cause
save
that
such
devotion
was
a
duty
and
i
hated
all
that
look
like
a
chain
for
me
or
others
this
even
rebellion
must
avouch
yet
hear
these
words
perhaps
among
my
last
that
none
valued
more
thy
virtues
though
he
knew
not
to
profit
by
them
at
ravenna
cain
was
also
written
a
dramatic
poem
in
some
degree
chiefly
in
its
boldness
resembling
the
ancient
mysteries
of
the
monasteries
before
the
secular
stage
was
established
this
performance
in
point
of
conception
is
of
a
sublime
order
the
object
of
the
poem
is
to
illustrate
the
energy
and
the
art
of
lucifer
in
accomplishing
the
ruin
of
the
by
an
unfair
misconception
the
arguments
of
lucifer
have
been
represented
as
the
sentiments
of
the
author
upon
some
imaginary
warranty
derived
from
the
exaggerated
freedom
of
his
life
and
yet
the
moral
tendency
of
the
reflections
are
framed
in
a
mood
of
reverence
as
awful
towards
omnipotence
as
the
austere
divinity
of
milton
it
would
be
presumption
in
me
however
to
undertake
the
defence
of
any
question
in
theology
but
i
have
not
been
sensible
to
the
imputed
impiety
while
i
have
felt
in
many
passages
influences
that
have
their
being
amid
the
shadows
and
twilights
of
old
religion
stupendous
spirits
that
mock
the
pride
of
man
and
people
space
with
life
and
mystical
predominance
the
morning
hymns
and
worship
with
which
the
mystery
opens
are
grave
solemn
and
scriptural
and
the
dialogue
which
follows
with
cain
is
no
less
so
his
opinion
of
the
tree
of
life
is
i
believe
orthodox
but
it
is
daringly
expressed
indeed
all
the
sentiments
ascribed
to
cain
are
but
the
questions
of
the
sceptics
his
description
of
the
approach
of
lucifer
would
have
shone
in
the
paradise
lost
a
shape
like
to
the
angels
yet
of
a
sterner
and
a
sadder
aspect
of
spiritual
essence
why
do
i
quake
why
should
i
fear
him
more
than
other
spirits
whom
i
see
daily
wave
their
fiery
swords
before
the
gates
round
which
i
linger
oft
in
twilight
hour
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
those
gardens
which
are
my
just
inheritance
ere
the
night
closes
the
inhibited
walls
and
the
immortal
trees
which
overtop
the
battlements
i
shrink
not
from
these
the
angels
why
should
i
quail
from
him
who
now
approaches
yet
he
seems
mightier
far
than
them
nor
less
beauteous
and
yet
not
all
as
beautiful
as
he
hath
been
or
might
be
sorrow
seems
half
of
his
immortality
there
is
something
spiritually
fine
in
this
conception
of
the
terror
or
presentiment
of
coming
evil
the
poet
rises
to
the
sublime
in
making
lucifer
first
inspire
cain
with
the
knowledge
of
his
immortality
a
portion
of
truth
which
hath
the
efficacy
of
falsehood
upon
the
victim
for
cain
feeling
himself
already
unhappy
knowing
that
his
being
can
not
be
abridged
has
the
less
scruple
to
desire
to
be
as
lucifer
mighty
the
whole
speech
of
lucifer
beginning
souls
who
dare
use
their
immortality
is
truly
satanic
a
daring
and
dreadful
description
given
by
everlasting
despair
of
the
deity
but
notwithstanding
its
manifold
immeasurable
imaginations
cain
is
only
a
polemical
controversy
the
doctrines
of
which
might
have
been
better
discussed
in
the
pulpit
of
a
college
chapel
as
a
poem
it
is
greatly
unequal
many
passages
consist
of
mere
metaphysical
disquisition
but
there
are
others
of
wonderful
scope
and
energy
it
is
a
thing
of
doubts
and
dreams
and
reveries
dim
and
beautiful
yet
withal
full
of
terrors
the
understanding
finds
nothing
tangible
but
amid
dread
and
solemnity
sees
only
a
shapen
darkness
with
eloquent
gestures
it
is
an
argument
invested
with
the
language
of
oracles
and
omens
conceived
in
some
religious
trance
and
addressed
to
spirits

with

the

of
the
guiccioli
to
remove
from
ravenna
to
pisa
in
this
compulsion
he
had
no
cause
to
complain
a
foreigner
meddling
with
the
politics
of
the
country
in
which
he
was
only
accidentally
resident
could
expect
no
deferential
consideration
from
the
government
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
whether
his
lordship
was
right
or
wrong
in
his
principles
the
government
was
in
the
possession
of
the
power
and
in
defence
he
could
expect
no
other
course
towards
him
than
what
he
did
experience
he
was
admonished
to
retreat
he
did
so
could
he
have
done

as

was

autumn
of
lord

from

to
pisa
where
he
hired
the
lanfranchi
palace
for
a
year
one
of
those
massy
marble
piles
which
appear
so
old
as
if
they
had
for
ever
stood
so
strong
as
if
they
would
for
ever
stand
both
in
aspect
and
character
it
was

the
boding
fancies
of
the
noble

said
to
have
been
constructed
from
a
design
of
michael
angelo
and
in
the
grandeur
of
its
features
exhibits
a
bold
and
colossal
style
not
unworthy
of
his
genius
the
lanfranchi
family
in
the
time
of
dante
were
distinguished
in
the
factions
of
those
days
and
one
of
them
has
received
his
meed
of
immortality
from
the
poet
as
the
persecutor
of
ugolino
they
are
now
extinct
and
their
traditionary
reputation
is
illustrated
by
the
popular
belief
in
the
neighbourhood
that
their
ghosts
are
restless
and
still
haunt
their
former
gloomy
and
gigantic
habitation
the
building
was
too
vast
for
the
establishment
of
lord
byron
and
he
occupied
only
the
first
floor
the
life
he
led
at
this
period
was
dull
and
unvaried
billiards
conversations
reading
and
occasionally
writing
constituted
the
regular
business
of
the
day
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
he
sometimes
went
out
in
his
carriage
oftener
on
horseback
and
generally
amused
himself
with
pistol
practice
at
a
piece
he
dined
at
half
an
hour
after
sunset
and
then
drove
to
count
gamba
where
he
passed
several
hours
with
the
countess
guiccioli
who
at
that
time
still
resided
with
her
father
on
his
return
he
read
or
wrote
till
the
night
was
far
spent
or
rather
till
the
morning
was
come
again
sipping
at
intervals
spirits
diluted
with
water
as
medicine
to
counteract
some
nephritic
disorder
to
which
he
considered
himself
liable
notwithstanding
the
tranquillity
of
this
course
of
life
he
was
accidentally
engaged
in
a
transaction
which
threatened
unpleasant
consequences
and
had
a
material
effect
on
his
comfort
on
the
of
march
as
he
was
returning
from
his
usual
ride
in
company
with
several
of
his
friends
a
hussar
officer
at
full
speed
dashed
through
the
party
and
violently
jostled
one
of
them
lord
byron
with
his
characteristic
impetuosity
instantly
pushed
forwards
and
the
rest
followed
and
overtook
the
hussar
his
lordship
inquired
what
he
meant
by
the
insult
but
for
answer
received
the
grossest
abuse
on
which
he
and
one
of
his
companions
gave
their
cards
and
passed
on
the
officer
followed
hallooing
and
threatening
with
his
hand
on
his
sabre
they
were
now
near
the
paggia
gate
during
this
altercation
a
common
artilleryman
interfered
and
called
out
to
the
hussar
why
do
you
arrest
them
command
us
to
arrest
them
upon
which
the
officer
gave
the
word
to
the
guard
at
the
gate
his
lordship
hearing
the
order
spurred
his
horse
and
one
of
his
party
doing
the
same
they
succeeded
in
forcing
their
way
through
the
soldiers
while
the
gate
was
closed
on
the
rest
of
the
party
with
whom
an
outrageous
scuffle
ensued
lord
byron
on
reaching
his
palace
gave
directions
to
inform
the
police
and
not
seeing
his
companions
coming
up
rode
back
towards
the
gate
on
his
way
the
hussar
met
him
and
said
are
you
satisfied
no
tell
me
your
name
masi
one
of
his
lordship
servants
who
at
this
moment
joined
them
seized
the
hussar
horse
by
the
bridle
but
his
master
commanded
him
to
let
it
go
the
hussar
then
spurred
his
horse
through
the
crowd
which
by
this
time
had
collected
in
front
of
the
lanfranchi
palace
and
in
the
attempt
was
wounded
by
a
pitchfork
several
of
the
servants
were
arrested
and
imprisoned
and
during
the
investigation
of
the
affair
before
the
police
lord
byron
house
was
surrounded
by
the
dragoons
belonging
to
masi
troop
who
threatened
to
force
the
doors
the
result
upon
these
particulars
was
not
just
all
lord
byron
italian
servants
were
banished
from
pisa
and
with
them
the
father
and
brother
of
the
guiccioli
who
had
no
concern
whatever
in
the
affair
lord
byron
himself
was
also
advised
to
quit
the
town
and
as
the
countess
accompanied
her
father
he
soon
after
joined
them
at
leghorn
and
passed
six
weeks
at
monte
nero
a
country
house
in
the
vicinity
of
that
city
it
was
during
his
lordship
residence
at
monte
nero
that
an
event
took
place
his
junction
with
mr
leigh
hunt
which
had
some
effect
both
on
his
literary
and
his
moral
reputation
previous
to
his
departure
from
england
there
had
been
some
intercourse
between
had
been
introduced
by
moore
to
hunt
when
the
latter
was
suffering
imprisonment
for
the
indiscretion
of
his
pen
and
by
his
civility
had
encouraged
him
perhaps
into
some
degree
of
forgetfulness
as
to
their
respective
situations
in
mr
hunt
at
no
period
of
their
acquaintance
appears
to
have
been
sufficiently
sensible
that
a
man
of
positive
rank
has
it
always
in
his
power
without
giving
anything
like
such
a
degree
of
offence
as
may
be
resented
otherwise
than
by
estrangement
to
inflict
mortification
and
in
consequence
presumed
too
much
to
an
equality
with
his
lordship
at
least
this
is
the
impression
his
conduct
made
upon
me
from
the
familiarity
of
his
dedicatory
epistle
prefixed
to
rimini
to
their
riding
out
at
pisa
together
dressed
alike
we
had
blue
coats
white
waistcoats
and
trousers
and
velvet
caps
a
la
raphael
and
cut
a
gallant
figure
i
do
not
discover
on
the
part
of
lord
byron
that
his
lordship
ever
forgot
his
rank
nor
was
he
a
personage
likely
to
do
so
in
saying
therefore
that
mr
hunt
presumed
upon
his
condescension
i
judge
entirely
by
his
own
statement
of
facts
i
am
not
undertaking
a
defence
of
his
lordship
for
the
manner
in
which
he
acted
towards
mr
hunt
because
it
appears
to
me
to
have
been
in
many
respects
mean
but
i
do
think
there
was
an
original
error
a
misconception
of
himself
on
the
part
of
mr
hunt
that
drew
down
about
him
a
degree
of
humiliation
that
he
might
by
more
have
avoided
however
i
shall
endeavour
to
give
as
correct
a
summary
of
the
whole
affair
as
the
materials
before
me
will
justify
the
occasion
of
hunt
removal
to
italy
will
be
best
explained
by
quoting
the
letter
from
his
friend
shelley
by
which
he
was
induced
to
take
that
obviously
imprudent
step
pisa
my
dearest
friend
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
i
have
been
on
a
visit
to
lord
byron
at
ravenna
the
result
of
this
visit
was
a
determination
on
his
part
to
come
and
live
at
pisa
and
i
have
taken
the
finest
palace
on
the
lung
arno
for
him
but
the
material
part
of
my
visit
consists
in
a
message
which
he
desires
me
to
give
you
and
which
i
think
ought
to
add
to
your
determination
for
such
a
one
i
hope
you
have
formed
of
restoring
your
shattered
health
and
spirits
by
a
migration
to
these
mild
of
calm
and
serene
air
he
proposes
that
you
should
come
and
go
shares
with
him
and
me
in
a
periodical
work
to
be
conducted
here
in
which
each
of
the
contracting
parties
should
publish
all
their
original
compositions
and
share
the
profits
he
proposed
it
to
moore
but
for
some
reason
it
was
never
brought
to
bear
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
profits
of
any
scheme
in
which
you
and
lord
byron
engage
must
for
various
yet
reasons
be
very
great
as
to
myself
i
am
for
the
present
only
a
sort
of
link
between
you
and
him
until
you
can
know
each
other
and
effectuate
the
arrangement
since
to
intrust
you
with
a
secret
which
for
your
sake
i
withhold
from
lord
byron
nothing
would
induce
me
to
share
in
the
profits
and
still
less
in
the
borrowed
splendour
of
such
a
partnership
you
and
he
in
different
manners
would
be
equal
and
would
bring
in
a
different
manner
but
in
the
same
proportion
equal
stocks
of
reputation
and
success
do
not
let
my
frankness
with
you
nor
my
belief
that
you
deserve
it
more
than
lord
byron
have
the
effect
of
deterring
you
from
assuming
a
station
in
modern
literature
which
the
universal
voice
of
my
contemporaries
forbids
me
either
to
stoop
or
aspire
to
i
am
and
i
desire
to
be
nothing
i
did
not
ask
lord
byron
to
assist
me
in
sending
a
remittance
for
your
journey
because
there
are
men
however
excellent
from
whom
we
would
never
receive
an
obligation
in
the
worldly
sense
of
the
word
and
i
am
as
jealous
for
my
friend
as
for
myself
i
as
you
know
have
it
not
but
i
suppose
that
at
last
i
shall
make
up
an
impudent
face
and
ask
horace
smith
to
add
to
the
many
obligations
he
has
conferred
on
me
i
know
i
need
only
ask
now
before
proceeding
farther
it
seems
from
this
epistle
and
there
is
no
reason
to
question
shelley
veracity
that
lord
byron
was
the
projector
of
the
liberal
that
hunt
political
notoriety
was
mistaken
for
literary
reputation
and
that
there
was
a
sad
lack
of
common
sense
in
the
whole
scheme

mr

prepared
to
avail
himself
of
the
invitation
which
he
was
the
more
easily
enabled
to
do
as
his
friend
notwithstanding
what
he
had
intimated
borrowed
two
hundred
pounds
from
lord
byron
and
remitted
to
him
he
reached
leghorn
soon
after
his
lordship
had
taken
up
his
temporary
residence
at
monte
nero
the
meeting
with
his
lordship
was
in
so
many
respects
remarkable
that
the
details
of
it
can
not
well
be
omitted
the
day
was
very
hot
and
when
hunt
reached
the
house
he
found
the
habitation
he
had
ever
seen
not
content
with
having
a
red
wash
over
it
the
red
was
the
most
unseasonable
of
all
reds
a
but
the
greatest
of
all
heats
was
within
lord
byron
was
grown
so
fat
that
he
scarcely
knew
him
and
was
dressed
in
a
loose
nankeen
jacket
and
white
trousers
his
neckcloth
open
and
his
hair
in
thin
ringlets
about
his
throat
altogether
presenting
a
very
different
aspect
from
the
compact
energetic
and
person
whom
hunt
had
known
in
england
his
lordship
took
the
stranger
into
an
inner
room
and
introduced
him
to
a
young
lady
who
was
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
this
was
the
guiccioli
presently
her
brother
also
in
great
agitation
entered
having
his
arm
in
a
sling
this
scene
and
confusion
had
arisen
from
a
quarrel
among
the
servants
in
which
the
young
count
having
interfered
had
been
stabbed
he
was
very
angry
the
countess
was
more
so
and
would
not
listen
to
the
comments
of
lord
byron
who
was
for
making
light
of
the
matter
indeed
it
looked
somewhat
serious
for
though
the
stab
was
not
much
the
inflicter
threatened
more
and
was
at
that
time
revengefully
keeping
watch
with
knotted
brows
under
the
portico
with
the
avowed
intention
of
assaulting
the
first
person
who
issued
forth
he
was
a
meager
caitiff
with
a
red
cap
gaunt
ugly
and
unshaven
his
appearance
altogether
more
squalid
and
miserable
than
englishmen
would
conceive
it
possible
to
find
in
such
an
establishment
an
end
however
was
put
to
the
tragedy
by
the
fellow
throwing
himself
on
a
bench
and
bursting
into
tears
wailing
and
asking
pardon
for
his
offence
and
perfecting
his
penitence
by
requesting
lord
byron
to
kiss
him
in
token
of
forgiveness
in
the
end
however
he
was
dismissed
and
it
being
arranged
that
mr
hunt
should
move
his
family
to
apartments
in
the
lanfranchi
palace
at
pisa
that
gentleman
returned
to
leghorn
the
account
which
mr
hunt
has
given
in
his
memoir
of
lord
byron
is
evidently
written
under
offended
feeling
and
in
consequence
though
he
does
not
appear
to
have
been
much
indebted
to
the
munificence
of
his
lordship
the
tendency
is
to
make
his
readers
sensible
that
he
was
if
not
ill
used
disappointed
the
casa
lanfranchi
was
a
huge
and
gaunt
building
capable
without
inconvenience
or
intermixture
of
accommodating
several
families
it
was
therefore
not
a
great
favour
in
his
lordship
considering
that
he
had
invited
mr
hunt
from
england
to
become
a
partner
with
him
in
a
speculation
purely
commercial
to
permit
him
to
occupy
the
or
flat
as
it
would
be
called
in
scotland
the
apartments
being
empty
furniture
was
necessary
and
the
plainest
was
provided
good
of
its
kind
and
respectable
it
yet
could
not
have
cost
a
great
deal
it
was
chosen
by
mr
shelley
who
intended
to
make
a
present
of
it
to
mr
hunt
but
when
the
apartments
were
fitted
up
lord
byron
insisted
upon
paying
the
account
and
to
that
extent
mr
hunt
incurred
a
pecuniary
obligation
to
his
lordship
the
two
hundred
pounds
already
mentioned
was
a
debt
to
mr
shelley
who
borrowed
the
money
from
lord
byron
soon
after
mr
hunt
family
were
settled
in
their
new
lodgings
shelley
returned
to
leghorn
with
the
intention
of
taking
a
sea
excursion
in
the
course
of
which
he
was
lost
lord
byron
knowing
how
much
hunt
was
dependent
on
that
gentleman
immediately
offered
him
the
command
of
his
purse
and
requested
to
be
considered
as
standing
in
the
place
of
shelley
his
particular
friend
this
was
both
gentlemanly
and
generous
and
the
offer
was
accepted
but
with
feelings
neither
just
nor
gracious
stern
necessity
and
a
large
family
compelled
me
says
mr
hunt
and
during
our
residence
at
pisa
i
had
from
him
or
rather
from
his
steward
to
whom
he
always
sent
me
for
the
money
and
who
doled
it
out
to
me
as
if
my
disgraces
were
being
counted
the
sum
of
seventy
pounds
this
sum
he
adds
together
with
the
payment
of
our
expenses
when
we
accompanied
him
from
pisa
to
genoa
and
thirty
pounds
with
which
he
enabled
us
subsequently
to
go
from
genoa
to
florence
was
all
the
money
i
ever
received
from
lord
byron
exclusive
of
the
two
hundred
pounds
which
in
the
first
instance
he
made
a
debt
of
mr
shelley
by
taking
his
bond
the
whole
extent
of
the
pecuniary
obligation
appears
certainly
not
to
have
exceeded
five
hundred
pounds
no
great
sum
but
little
or
great
the
manner
in
which
it
was
recollected
reflects
no
credit
either
on
the
head
or
heart
of
the
debtor
mr
hunt
in
extenuation
of
the
bitterness
with
which
he
has
spoken
on
the
subject
says
that
lord
byron
made
no
scruple
of
talking
very
freely
of
me
and
mine
it
may
therefore
be
possible
that
mr
hunt
had
cause
for
his
resentment
and
to
feel
the
humiliation
of
being
under
obligations
to
a
mean
man
at
the
same
time
lord
byron
on
his
side
may
upon
experience
have
found
equal
reason
to
repent
of
his
connection
with
mr
hunt
and
it
is
certain
that
each
has
sought
to
justify
both
to
himself
and
to
the
world
the
rupture
of
a
copartnery
which
ought
never
to
have
been
formed
but
his
conduct
is
the
least
justifiable
he
had
allured
hunt
to
italy
with
flattering
hopes
he
had
a
perfect
knowledge
of
his
hampered
circumstances
and
he
was
thoroughly
aware
that
until
their
speculation
became
productive
he
must
support
him
to
the
extent
of
about
five
hundred
pounds
he
did
so
a
trifle
considering
the
glittering
anticipations
of
their
scheme
viewing
their
copartnery
however
as
a
mere
commercial
speculation
his
lordship
advance
could
not
be
regarded
as
liberal
and
no
modification
of
the
term
munificence
or
patronage
could
be
applied
to
it
but
unless
he
had
harassed
hunt
for
the
repayment
of
the
money
which
does
not
appear
to
have
been
the
case
nor
could
he
morally
perhaps
even
legally
have
done
so
that
gentleman
had
no
cause
to
complain
the
joint
adventure
was
a
failure
and
except
a
little
repining
on
the
part
of
the
one
for
the
loss
of
his
advance
and
of
grudging
on
that
of
the
other
for
the
waste
of
his
time
no
sharper
feeling
ought
to
have
arisen
between
them
but
vanity
was
mingled
with
their
golden
dreams
lord
byron
mistook
hunt
political
notoriety
for
literary
reputation
and
mr
hunt
thought
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
be
chum
and
partner
with
so
renowned
a
lord
after
all
however
the
worst
which
can
be
said
of
it
is
that
formed
in
weakness
it
could
produce
only
vexation
but
the
dissolution
of
the
vapour
with
which
both
parties
were
so
intoxicated
and
which
led
to
their
quarrel
might
have
occasioned
only
amusement
to
the
world
had
it
not
left
an
ignoble
stigma
on
the
character
of
lord
byron
and
given
cause
to
every
admirer
of
his
genius
to
deplore
that
he
should
have
so
forgotten
his
dignity
and
fame
there
is
no
disputing
the
fact
that
his
lordship
in
conceiving
the
plan
of
the
liberal
was
actuated
by
sordid
motives
and
of
the
basest
kind
inasmuch
as
it
was
intended
that
the
popularity
of
the
work
should
rest
upon
satire
or
in
other
words
on
the
ability
to
be
displayed
by
it
in
the
art
of
detraction
being
disappointed
in
his
hopes
of
profit
he
shuffled
out
of
the
concern
as
meanly
as
any
higgler
could
have
done
who
had
found
himself
in
a
profitless
business
with
a
disreputable
partner
there
is
no
disguising
this
unvarnished
truth
and
though
his
friends
did
well
in
getting
the
connection
ended
as
quickly
as
possible
they
could
not
eradicate
the
original
sin
of
the
transaction
nor
extinguish
the
consequences
which
it
of
necessity
entailed
let
me
not
however
be
misunderstood
my
objection
to
the
conduct
of
byron
does
not
lie
against
the
wish
to
turn
his
extraordinary
talents
to
profitable
account
but
to
the
mode
in
which
he
proposed
to
and
did
employ
them
whether
mr
hunt
was
or
was
not
a
fit
copartner
for
one
of
his
lordship
rank
and
celebrity
i
do
not
undertake
to
judge
but
any
individual
was
good
enough
for
that
vile
prostitution
of
his
genius
to
which
in
an
unguarded
hour
he
submitted
for
money
indeed
it
would
be
doing
injustice
to
compare
the
motives
of
mr
hunt
in
the
business
with
those
by
which
lord
byron
was
infatuated
he
put
nothing
to
hazard
happen
what
might
he
could
not
be
otherwise
than
a
gainer
for
if
profit
failed
it
could
not
be
denied
that
the
foremost
poet
of
all
the
age
had
discerned
in
him
either
the
promise
or
the
existence
of
merit
which
he
was
desirous
of
associating
with
his
own
this
advantage
mr
hunt
did
gain
by
the
connection
and
it
is
his
own
fault
that
he
can
not
be
recollected
as
the
associate
of
byron
but
only
as
having
attempted
to
deface
his
monument
chapter
xxxix
mr
shelley
sketch
of
his
life
his
death
the
burning
of
his
body
and
the
return
of
the
mourners
it
has
been
my
study
in
writing
these
sketches
to
introduce
as
few
names
as
the
nature
of
the
work
would
admit
of
but
lord
byron
connected
himself
with
persons
who
had
claims
to
public
consideration
on
account
of
their
talents
and
without
affectation
it
is
not
easy
to
avoid
taking
notice
of
his
intimacy
with
some
of
them
especially
if
in
the
course
of
it
any
circumstance
came
to
pass
which
was
in
itself
remarkable
or
likely
to
have
produced
an
impression
on
his
lordship
mind
his
friendship
with
mr
shelley
mentioned
in
the
preceding
chapter
was
an
instance
of
this
kind
that
unfortunate
gentleman
was
undoubtedly
a
man
of
genius
full
of
ideal
beauty
and
enthusiasm
and
yet
there
was
some
defect
in
his
understanding
by
which
he
subjected
himself
to
the
accusation
of
atheism
in
his
dispositions
he
is
represented
to
have
been
ever
calm
and
amiable
and
but
for
his
metaphysical
errors
and
reveries
and
a
singular
incapability
of
conceiving
the
existing
state
of
things
as
it
practically
affects
the
nature
and
condition
of
man
to
have
possessed
many
of
the
gentlest
qualities
of
humanity
he
highly
admired
the
endowments
of
lord
byron
and
in
return
was
esteemed
by
his
lordship
but
even
had
there
been
neither
sympathy
nor
friendship
between
them
his
premature
fate
could
not
but
have
saddened
byron
with
no
common
sorrow
mr
shelley
was
some
years
younger
than
his
noble
friend
he
was
the
eldest
son
of
sir
timothy
shelley
of
castle
goring
sussex
at
the
age
of
thirteen
he
was
sent
to
eton
where
he
rarely
mixed
in
the
common
amusements
of
the
other
boys
but
was
of
a
shy
reserved
disposition
fond
of
solitude
and
made
few
friends
he
was
not
distinguished
for
his
proficiency
in
the
regular
studies
of
the
school
on
the
contrary
he
neglected
them
for
german
and
chemistry
his
abilities
were
superior
but
deteriorated
by
eccentricity
at
the
age
of
sixteen
he
was
sent
to
the
university
of
oxford
where
he
soon
distinguished
himself
by
publishing
a
pamphlet
under
the
absurd
and
title
of
the
necessity
of
atheism
for
which
he
was
expelled
from
the
university
the
event
proved
fatal
to
his
prospects
in
life
and
the
treatment
he
received
from
his
family
was
too
harsh
to
win
him
from
error
his
father
however
in
a
short
time
relented
and
he
was
received
home
but
he
took
so
little
trouble
to
conciliate
the
esteem
of
his
friends
that
he
found
the
house
uncomfortable
and
left
it
he
then
went
to
london
where
he
eloped
with
a
young
lady
to
gretna
green
their
united
ages
amounted
to
and
the
match
being
deemed
unsuitable
to
his
rank
and
prospects
it
so
exasperated
his
father
that
he
broke
off
all
communication
with
him
after
their
marriage
the
young
couple
resided
some
time
in
edinburgh
they
then
passed
over
to
ireland
which
being
in
a
state
of
disturbance
shelley
took
a
part
in
politics
more
reasonable
than
might
have
been
expected
he
inculcated
moderation
about
this
tune
he
became
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
his
poetical
talents
but
his
works
were
sullied
with
the
erroneous
inductions
of
an
understanding
which
inasmuch
as
he
regarded
all
the
existing
world
in
the
wrong
must
be
considered
as
having
been
either
shattered
or
defective
his
rash
marriage
proved
of
course
an
unhappy
one
after
the
birth
of
two
children
a
separation
by
mutual
consent
took
place
and
mrs
shelley
committed
suicide
he
then
married
a
daughter
of
mr
godwin
the
author
of
caleb
williams
and
they
resided
for
some
time
at
great
marlow
in
buckinghamshire
much
respected
for
their
charity
in
the
meantime
his
irreligious
opinions
had
attracted
public
notice
and
in
consequence
of
his
unsatisfactory
notions
of
the
deity
his
children
probably
at
the
instance
of
his
father
were
taken
from
him
by
a
decree
of
the
lord
chancellor
an
event
which
with
increasing
pecuniary
embarrassments
induced
him
to
quit
england
with
the
intention
of
never
returning
being
in
switzerland
when
lord
byron
after
his
domestic
tribulations
arrived
at
geneva
they
became
acquainted
he
then
crossed
the
alps
and
again
at
venice
renewed
his
friendship
with
his
lordship
he
thence
passed
to
rome
where
he
resided
some
time
and
after
visiting
naples
fixed
his
permanent
residence
in
tuscany
his
acquirements
were
constantly
augmenting
and
he
was
without
question
an
accomplished
person
he
was
however
more
of
a
metaphysician
than
a
poet
though
there
are
splendid
specimens
of
poetical
thought
in
his
works
as
a
man
he
was
objected
to
only
on
account
of
his
speculative
opinions
for
he
possessed
many
amiable
qualities
was
just
in
his
intentions
and
generous
to
excess
when
he
had
seen
mr
hunt
established
in
the
casa
lanfranchi
with
lord
byron
at
pisa
mr
shelley
returned
to
leghorn
for
the
purpose
of
taking
a
sea
excursion
an
amusement
to
which
he
was
much
attached
during
a
violent
storm
the
boat
was
swamped
and
the
party
on
board
were
all
drowned
their
bodies
were
however
afterwards
cast
on
shore
mr
shelley
was
found
near
via
reggio
and
being
greatly
decomposed
and
unfit
to
be
removed
it
was
determined
to
reduce
the
remains
to
ashes
that
they
might
be
carried
to
a
place
of
sepulture
accordingly
preparations
were
made
for
the
burning
wood
in
abundance
was
found
on
the
shore
consisting
of
old
trees
and
the
wreck
of
vessels
the
spot
itself
was
well
suited
for
the
ceremony
the
magnificent
bay
of
spezzia
was
on
the
right
and
leghorn
on
the
left
at
equal
distances
of
about
miles
the
headlands
project
boldly
far
into
the
sea
in
front
lie
several
islands
and
behind
dark
forests
and
the
cliffy
apennines
nothing
was
omitted
that
could
exalt
and
dignify
the
mournful
rites
with
the
associations
of
classic
antiquity
frankincense
and
wine
were
not
forgotten
the
weather
was
serene
and
beautiful
and
the
pacified
ocean
was
silent
as
the
flame
rose
with
extraordinary
brightness
lord
byron
was
present
but
he
should
himself
have
described
the
scene
and
what
he
felt
these
antique
obsequies
were
undoubtedly
affecting
but
the
return
of
the
mourners
from
the
burning
is
the
most
appalling
orgia
without
the
horror
of
crime
of
which
i
have
ever
heard
when
the
duty
was
done
and
the
ashes
collected
they
dined
and
drank
much
together
and
bursting
from
the
calm
mastery
with
which
they
had
repressed
their
feelings
during
the
solemnity
gave
way
to
frantic
exultation
they
were
all
drunk
they
sang
they
shouted
and
their
barouche
was
driven
like
a
whirlwind
through
the
forest
i
can
conceive
nothing
descriptive
of
the
demoniac
revelry
of
that
flight
but
scraps
of
the
dead

it

day
go
down
upon
your
native
spires
so
calmly
with
its
gold
and
crimson
glory
and
after
dreaming
a
disturbed
vision
of
them
and
theirs
awoke
and
found
them
not
all
this
speaks
of
the
voluntary
exile
own
regrets
and
awakens
sympathy
for
the
anguish
which
pride
concealed
but
unable
to
repress
gave
vent
to
in
the
imagined
sufferings
of
one
that
was
to
him
as
hecuba
it
was
at
pisa
that
werner
or
the
inheritance
a
tragedy
was
written
or
at
least
completed
it
is
taken
entirely
from
the
german
tale
kruitzner
published
many
years
before
by
one
of
the
miss
lees
in
their
canterbury
tales
so
far
back
as
byron
began
a
drama
upon
the
same
subject
and
nearly
completed
an
act
when
he
was
interrupted
i
have
adopted
he
says
himself
the
characters
plan
and
even
the
language
of
many
parts
of
this
story
an
acknowledgment
which
exempts
it
from
that
kind
of
criticism
to
which
his
principal
works
are
herein
subjected
but
the
deformed
transformed
which
was
also
written
at
pisa
is
though
confessedly
an
imitation
of
goethe
faust
substantially
an
original
work
in
the
opinion
of
mr
moore
it
probably
owes
something
to
the
author
painful
sensibility
to
the
defect
in
his
own
foot
an
accident
which
must
from
the
acuteness
with
which
he
felt
it
have
essentially
contributed
to
enable
him
to
comprehend
and
to
express
the
envy
of
those
afflicted
with
irremediable
exceptions
to
the
ordinary
course
of
fortune
or
who
have
been
amerced
by
nature
of
their
fair
proportions
but
save
only
a
part
of
the
first
scene
the
sketch
will
not
rank
among
the
felicitous
works
of
the
poet
it
was
intended
to
be
a
satire
probably
at
least
but
it
is
only
a
fragment
a
failure
hitherto
i
have
not
noticed
don
juan
otherwise
than
incidentally
it
was
commenced
in
venice
and
afterward
continued
at
intervals
to
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
canto
until
the
author
left
pisa
when
it
was
not
resumed
at
least
no
more
has
been
published
strong
objections
have
been
made
to
its
moral
tendency
but
in
the
opinion
of
many
it
is
the
poet
masterpiece
and
undoubtedly
it
displays
all
the
variety
of
his
powers
combined
with
a
quaint
playfulness
not
found
to
an
equal
degree
in
any
other
of
his
works
the
serious
and
pathetic
portions
are
exquisitely
beautiful
the
descriptive
have
all
the
distinctness
of
the
best
pictures
in
childe
harold
and
are
moreover
generally
drawn
from
nature
while
the
satire
is
for
the
most
part
curiously
associated
and
sparklingly
witty
the
characters
are
sketched
with
amazing
firmness
and
freedom
and
though
sometimes
grotesque
are
yet
not
often
overcharged
it
is
professedly
an
epic
poem
but
it
may
be
more
properly
described
as
a
poetical
novel
nor
can
it
be
said
to
inculcate
any
particular
moral
or
to
do
more
than
unmantle
the
decorum
of
society
bold
and
buoyant
throughout
it
exhibits
a
free
irreverent
knowledge
of
the
world
laughing
or
mocking
as
the
thought
serves
in
the
most
unexpected
antitheses
to
the
proprieties
of
time
place
and
circumstance
the
object
of
the
poem
is
to
describe
the
progress
of
a
libertine
through
life
not
an
unprincipled
prodigal
whose
profligacy
growing
with
his
growth
and
strengthening
with
his
strength
passes
from
voluptuous
indulgence
into
the
sordid
sensuality
of
systematic
debauchery
but
a
young
gentleman
who
whirled
by
the
vigour
and
vivacity
of
his
animal
spirits
into
a
world
of
adventures
in
which
his
stars
are
chiefly
in
fault
for
his
liaisons
settles
at
last
into
an
honourable
lawgiver
a
moral
speaker
on
divorce
bills
and
possibly
a
subscriber
to
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
vice
the
author
has
not
completed
his
design
but
such
appears
to
have
been
the
drift
of
it
affording
ample
opportunities
to
unveil
the
foibles
and
follies
of
all
sorts
of
men
and
women
too
it
is
generally
supposed
to
contain
much
of
the
author
own
experience
but
still
with
all
its
riant
knowledge
of
bowers
and
boudoirs
it
is
deficient
as
a
true
limning
of
the
world
by
showing
man
as
if
he
were
always
ruled
by
one
predominant
appetite
in
the
character
of
donna
inez
and
don
jose
it
has
been
imagined
that
lord
byron
has
sketched
himself
and
his
lady
it
may
be
so
and
if
it
were
he
had
by
that
time
got
pretty
well
over
the
lachrymation
of
their
parting
it
is
no
longer
doubtful
that
the
stanza
records
a
biographical
fact
and
the
his
own
feelings
when
poor
fellow
he
had
many
things
to
wound
him
let
own
since
it
can
do
no
good
on
earth
it
was
a
trying
moment
that
which
found
him
standing
alone
beside
his
desolate
hearth
where
all
his
household
gods
lay
shiver
round
him
no
choice
was
left
his
feelings
or
his
pride
save
death
or
doctors
commons
it
has
been
already
mentioned
that
while
the
poet
was
at
dr
glennie
academy
at
dulwich
he
read
an
account
of
a
shipwreck
which
has
been
supposed
to
have
furnished
some
of
the
most
striking
incidents
in
the
description
of
the
disastrous
voyage
in
the
second
canto
in
don
juan
i
have
not
seen
that
work
but
whatever
lord
byron
may
have
found
in
it
suitable
to
his
purpose
he
has
undoubtedly
made
good
use
of
his
grandfather
adventures
the
incident
of
the
spaniel
is
related
by
the
admiral
in
the
licence
of
don
juan
the
author
seems
to
have
considered
that
his
wonted
accuracy
might
be
dispensed
with
the
description
of
haidee
applies
to
an
albanian
not
a
greek
girl
the
splendour
of
her
father
house
is
altogether
preposterous
and
the
island
has
no
resemblance
to
those
of
the
cyclades
with
the
exception
of
zea
his
lordship
however
did
not
visit
them
some
degree
of
error
and
unlike
description
runs
indeed
through
the
whole
of
the
still
life
around
the
portrait
of
haidee
the
fete
which
lambro
discovers
on
his
return
is
however
prettily
described
and
the
dance
is
as
perfect
as
true
and
farther
on
a
group
of
grecian
girls
the
first
and
tallest
her
white
kerchief
waving
were
strung
together
like
a
row
of
pearls
link
hand
in
hand
and
dancing
each
too
having
down
her
white
neck
long
floating
auburn
curls
their
leader
sang
and
bounded
to
her
song
with
choral
step
and
voice
the
virgin
throng
the
account
of
lambro
proceeding
to
the
house
is
poetically
imagined
and
in
his
character
may
be
traced
a
vivid
likeness
of
ali
pasha
and
happy
illustrative
allusions
to
the
adventures
of
that
chief
the
fourth
canto
was
written
at
ravenna
it
is
so
said
within
itself
and
the
description
of
dante
sepulchre
there
may
be
quoted
for
its
truth
and
the
sweet
modulation
of
the
moral
reflection
interwoven
with
it
i
pass
each
day
where
dante
bones
are
laid
a
little
cupola
more
neat
than
solemn
protects
his
dust
but
reverence
here
is
paid
to
the
bard
tomb
and
not
the
warrior
column
the
time
must
come
when
both
alike
decay
the
chieftain
trophy
and
the
poet
volume
will
sink
where
lie
the
songs
and
wars
of
earth
before
pelides
death
or
homer
birth
the
fifth
canto
was
also
written
in
ravenna
but
it
is
not
my
intention
to
analyze
this
eccentric
and
meandering
poem
a
composition
which
can
not
be
well
estimated
by
extracts
without
therefore
dwelling
at
greater
length
on
its
variety
and
merits
i
would
only
observe
that
the
general
accuracy
of
the
descriptions
is
verified
by
that
of
the
scenes
in
which
juan
is
placed
in
england
a
point
the
reader
may
determine
for
himself
while
the
vagueness
of
the
parts
derived
from
books
or
sketched
from
fancy
as
contrasted
with
them
justifies
the
opinion
that
invention
was
not
the
most
eminent
faculty
of
byron
either
in
scenes
or
in
characters
of
the
demerits
of
the
poem
it
is
only
necessary
to
remark
that
it
has
been
proscribed
on
account
of
its
immorality
perhaps
however
there
was
more
of
prudery
than
of
equity
in
the
decision
at
least
it
is
liable
to
be
so
considered
so
long
as
reprints
are
permitted
of
the
older
dramatists
with
all
their
unpruned
licentiousness
but
the
wheels
of
byron
destiny
were
now
hurrying
both
in
the
conception
and
composition
of
don
juan
he
evinced
an
increasing
disregard
of
the
world
opinion
and
the
project
of
the
liberal
was
still
more
fatal
to
his
reputation
not
only
were
the
invidious
eyes
of
bigotry
now
eagerly
fixed
upon
his
conduct
but
those
of
admiration
were
saddened
and
turned
away
from
him
his
principles
which
would
have
been
more
correctly
designated
as
paradoxes
were
objects
of
jealousy
to
the
tuscan
government
and
it
has
been
already
seen
that
there
was
a
disorderliness
about
the
casa
lanfranchi
which
attracted
the
attention
of
the
police
his
situation
in
pisa
became
in
consequence
irksome
and
he
resolved
to
remove
to
genoa
an
intention
which
he
carried
into
effect
about
the
end
of
september
at
which
period
his
thoughts
began
to
gravitate
towards
greece
having
attained
to
the
summit
of
his
literary
eminence
he
grew
ambitious
of
trying
fortune
in
another
field
of
adventure
in
all
the
migrations
of
lord
byron
there
was
ever
something
grotesque
and
desultory
in
moving
from
ravenna
to
pisa
his
caravan
consisted
of
seven
servants
five
carriages
nine
horses
a
monkey
a
bulldog
and
a
mastiff
two
cats
three
peafowl
a
harem
of
hens
books
saddles
and
firearms
with
a
chaos
of
furniture
nor
was
the
exodus
less
fantastical
for
in
addition
to
all
his
own

a

village
on

in
the
vicinity
of
the
city
it
was
the
casa
saluzzi
and
i
have
been
told
that
during
the
time
he
resided
there
he
seemed
to
enjoy
a
more
uniform
and
temperate
gaiety
than
in
any
former
period
of
his
life
there
might
have
been
less
of
sentiment
in
his
felicity
than
when
he
lived
at
ravenna
as
he
seldom
wrote
poetry
but
he
appeared
to
some
of
his
occasional
visitors
who
knew
him
in
london
to
have
become
more
agreeable
and
manly
i
may
add
at
the
risk
of
sarcasm
for
the
vanity
that
in
proof
of
his
mellowed
temper
towards
me
besides
the
kind
frankness
with
which
he
received
my
friend
as
already
mentioned
he
sent
me
word
by
the
earl
of
blesinton
that
he
had
read
my
novel
of
the
entail
three
times
and
thought
the
old
leddy
grippy
one
of
the
most
heroines
he
had
ever
met
with
this
was
the
more
agreeable
as
i
had
heard
within
the
same
week
that
sir
walter
scott
had
done
and
said
nearly
the
same
thing
half
the
compliment
from
two
such
men
would
be
something
to
be
proud
of
lord
byron
residence
at
albaro
was
separate
from
that
of
mr
hunt
and
in
consequence
they
were
more
rarely
together
than
when
domiciled
under
the
same
roof
as
at
pisa
indeed
by
this
time
if
one
may
take
mr
hunt
own
account
of
the
matter
they
appear
to
have
become
pretty
well
tired
of
each
other
he
had
found
out
that
a
peer
is
as
a
friend
but
as
a
plebeian
and
a
great
poet
not
always
a
man
his
lordship
had
on
his
part
discovered
that
something
more
than
smartness
or
ingenuity
is
necessary
to
protect
patronage
from
familiarity
perhaps
intimate
acquaintance
had
also
tended
to
enable
him
to
appreciate
with
greater
accuracy
the
meretricious
genius
and
artificial
tastes
of
his
copartner
in
the
liberal
it
is
certain
that
he
laughed
at
his
affected
admiration
of
landscapes
and
considered
his
descriptions
of
scenery
as
drawn
from
pictures
one
day
as
a
friend
of
mine
was
conversing
with
his
lordship
at
the
casa
saluzzi
on
the
moral
impressions
of
magnificent
scenery
he
happened
to
remark
that
he
thought
the
view
of
the
alps
in
the
evening
from
turin
the
sublimest
scene
he
had
ever
beheld
it
is
impossible
said
he
at
such
a
time
when
all
the
west
is
golden
and
glowing
behind
them
to
contemplate
such
vast
masses
of
the
deity
without
being
awed
into
rest
and
forgetting
such
things
as
man
and
his
follies
hunt
said
his
lordship
smiling
has
no
perception
of
the
sublimity
of
alpine
scenery
he
calls
a
mountain
a
great
impostor
in
the
mean
time
the
materials
for
the
first
number
of
the
liberal
had
been
transmitted
to
london
where
the
manuscript
of
the
vision
of
judgment
was
already
and
something
of
its
quality
known
all
his
lordship
friends
were
disturbed
at
the
idea
of
the
publication
they
did
not
like
the
connection
he
had
formed
with
mr
shelley
they
liked
still
less
the
copartnery
with
mr
hunt
with
the
justice
or
injustice
of
these
dislikes
i
have
nothing
to
do
it
is
an
historical
fact
that
they
existed
and
became
motives
with
those
who
deemed
themselves
the
custodiers
of
his
lordship
fame
to
seek
a
dissolution
of
the
association
the
first
number
of
the
liberal
containing
the
vision
of
judgment
was
received
soon
after
the
copartnery
had
established
themselves
at
genoa
accompanied
with
hopes
and
fears
much
good
could
not
be
anticipated
from
a
work
which
outraged
the
loyal
and
decorous
sentiments
of
the
nation
towards
the
memory
of
george
iii
to
the
second
number
lord
byron
contributed
the
heaven
and
earth
a
sacred
drama
which
has
been
much
misrepresented
in
consequence
of
its
fraternity
with
don
juan
and
the
vision
of
judgment
for
it
contains
no
expression
to
which
religion
can
object
nor
breathes
a
thought
at
variance
with
the
genesis
the
history
of
literature
affords
no
instance
of
a
condemnation
less
justifiable
on
the
plea
of
profanity
than
that
of
this
mystery
that
it
abounds
in
literary
blemishes
both
of
plan
and
language
and
that
there
are
harsh
jangles
and
discords
in
the
verse
is
not
disputed
but
still
it
abounds
in
a
grave
patriarchal
spirit
and
is
echo
to
the
oracles
of
adam
and
melchisedek
it
may
not
be
worthy
of
lord
byron
genius
but
it
does
him
no
dishonour
and
contains
passages
which
accord
with
the
solemn
diapasons
of
ancient
devotion
the
disgust
which
the
vision
of
judgment
had
produced
rendered
it
easy
to
persuade
the
world
that
there
was
impiety
in
the
heaven
and
earth
although
in
point
of
fact
it
may
be
described
as
hallowed
with
the
scriptural
theology
of
milton
the
objections
to
its
literary
defects
were
magnified
into
sins
against
worship
and
religion
the
liberal
stopped
with
the
fourth
number
i
believe
it
disappointed
not
merely
literary
men
in
general
but
even
the
most
special
admirers
of
the
talents
of
the
contributors
the
main
defect
of
the
work
was
a
lack
of
knowledge
neither
in
style
nor
genius
nor
even
in
general
ability
was
it
wanting
but
where
it
showed
learning
it
was
not
of
a
kind
in
which
the
age
took
much
interest
moreover
the
manner
and
cast
of
thinking
of
all
the
writers
in
it
were
familiar
to
the
public
and
they
were
too
few
in
number
to
variegate
their
pages
with
sufficient
novelty
but
the
main
cause
of
the
failure
was
the
antipathy
formed
and
fostered
against
it
before
it
appeared
it
was
cried
down
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
it
did
not
much
deserve
a
better
fate
with
the
liberal
i
shall
close
my
observations
on
the
works
of
lord
byron
they
are
too
voluminous
to
be
examined
even
in
the
brief
and
sketchy
manner
in
which
i
have
considered
those
which
are
deemed
the
principal
besides
they
are
not
like
them
all
characteristic
of
the
author
though
possessing
great
similarity
in
style
and
thought
to
one
another
nor
would
such
general
criticism
accord
with
the
plan
of
this
work
lord
byron
was
not
always
thinking
of
himself
like
other
authors
he
sometimes
wrote
from
imaginary
circumstances
and
often
fancied
both
situations
and
feelings
which
had
no
reference
to
his
own
nor
to
his
experience
but
were
the
matter
deserving
of
the
research
i
am
persuaded
that
with
mr
moore
work
and
the
poet
original
journals
notes
and
letters
innumerable
additions
might
be
made
to
the
list
of
passages
which
the
incidents
of
his
own
life
dictated
the
abandonment
of
the
liberal
closed
his
lordship
connection
with
mr
hunt
their
friendship
if
such
ever
really
existed
was
ended
long
before
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
byron
has
not
given
some
account
of
it
himself
for
the
manner
in
which
he
is
represented
to
have
acted
towards
his
unfortunate
partner
renders
another
version
of
the
tale
desirable
at
the
same
time
and
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
are
disposed
to
magnify
the
faults
and
infirmities
of
byron
i
fear
there
is
no
excess
of
truth
in
hunt
opinion
of
him
i
judge
by
an
account
which
lord
byron
gave
himself
to
a
mutual
friend
who
did
not
however
see
the
treatment
in
exactly
the
same
light
as
that
in
which
it
appeared
to
me
but
while
i
can
not
regard
his
lordship
conduct
as
otherwise
than
unworthy
still
the
pains
which
mr
hunt
has
taken
to
elaborate
his
character
and
dispositions
into
every
modification
of
weakness
almost
justifies
us
in
thinking
that
he
was
treated
according
to
his
deserts
byron
had
at
least
the
manners
of
a
gentleman
and
though
not
a
judicious
knowledge
of
the
world
he
yet
possessed
prudence
enough
not
to
be
always
unguarded
mr
hunt
informs
us
that
when
he
joined
his
lordship
at
leghorn
his
own
health
was
impaired
and
that
his
disease
rather
increased
than
diminished
during
his
residence
at
pisa
and
genoa
to
say
nothing
of
the
effect
which
the
loss
of
his
friend
had
on
him
and
the
disappointment
he
suffered
in
the
liberal
some
excuse
may
therefore
be
made
for
him
in
such
a
condition
misapprehensions
were
natural
jocularity
might
be
mistaken
for
sarcasm
and
caprice
felt
as
insolence

while
the
liberal
was
halting
onward
to
its
natural
doom
the
attention
of
lord
byron
was
attracted
towards
the
struggles
of
greece
in
that
country
his
genius
was
first
effectually
developed
his
name
was
associated
with
many
of
its
most
romantic
scenes
and
the
cause
was
popular
with
all
the
educated
and
refined
of
europe
he
had
formed
besides
a
personal
attachment
to
the
land
and
perhaps
many
of
his
most
agreeable
local
associations
were
fixed
amid
the
ruins
of
greece
and
in
her
desolated
valleys
the
name
is
indeed
alone
calculated
to
awaken
the
noblest
feelings
of
humanity
the
spirit
of
her
poets
the
wisdom
and
the
heroism
of
her
worthies
whatever
is
splendid
in
genius
unparalleled
in
art
glorious
in
arms
and
wise
in
philosophy
is
associated
in
their
highest
excellence
with
that
beautiful
region
had
lord
byron
never
been
in
greece
he
was
undoubtedly
one
of
those
men
whom
the
resurrection
of
her
spirit
was
likeliest
to
interest
but
he
was
not
also
one
fitted
to
do
her
cause
much
service
his
innate
indolence
his
sedentary
habits
and
that
engrossing
consideration
for
himself
which
in
every
situation
marred
his
best
impulses
were
shackles
upon
the
practice
of
the
stern
bravery
in
himself
which
he
has
so
well
expressed
in
his
works
it
was
expected
when
he
sailed
for
greece
nor
was
the
expectation
unreasonable
with
those
who
believe
imagination
and
passion
to
be
of
the
same
element
that
the
enthusiasm
which
flamed
so
highly
in
his
verse
was
the
spirit
of
action
and
would
prompt
him
to
undertake
some
great
enterprise
but
he
was
only
an
artist
he
could
describe
bold
adventures
and
represent
high
feeling
as
other
gifted
individuals
give
eloquence
to
canvas
and
activity
to
marble
but
he
did
not
possess
the
wisdom
necessary
for
the
instruction
of
councils
i
do
therefore
venture
to
say
that
in
embarking
for
greece
he
was
not
entirely
influenced
by
such
exoterical
motives
as
the
love
of
glory
or
the
aspirations
of
heroism
his
laurels
had
for
some
time
ceased
to
flourish
the
sear
and
yellow
the
mildew
and
decay
had
fallen
upon
them
and
he
was
aware
that
the
bright
round
of
his
fame
was
ovalling
from
the
full
and
showing
the
dim
rough
edge
of
waning
he
was
moreover
tired
of
the
guiccioli
and
again
afflicted
with
a
desire
for
some
new
object
with
which
to
be
in
earnest
the
greek
cause
seemed
to
offer
this
and
a
better
chance
for
distinction
than
any
other
pursuit
in
which
he
could
then
engage
in
the
spring
of
he
accordingly
made
preparations
for
transferring
himself
from
genoa
to
greece
and
opened
a
correspondence
with
the
leaders
of
the
insurrection
that
the
importance
of
his
adhesion
might
be
duly
appreciated
greece
with
a
fair
prospect
of
ultimate
success
was
at
that
time
as
distracted
in
her
councils
as
ever
her
arms
had
been
victorious
but
the
ancient
jealousy
of
the
greek
mind
was
unmitigated
the
third
campaign
had
commenced
and
yet
no
regular
government
had
been
organized
the
fiscal
resources
of
the
country
were
neglected
a
wild
energy
against
the
ottomans
was
all
that
the
greeks
could
depend
on
for
continuing
the
war
lord
byron
arrived
in
cephalonia
about
the
middle
of
august
where
he
fixed
his
residence
for
some
time
this
was
prudent
but
it
said
nothing
for
that
spirit
of
enterprise
with
which
a
man
engaging
in
such
a
cause
in
such
a
country
and
with
such
a
people
ought
to
have
been
actuated
especially
after
marco
botzaris
one
of
the
best
and
most
distinguished
of
the
chiefs
had
earnestly
urged
him
to
join
him
at
missolonghi
i
fear
that
i
may
not
be
able
to
do
justice
to
byron
part
in
the
affairs
of
greece
but
i
shall
try
he
did
not
disappoint
me
for
he
only
acted
as
might
have
been
expected
from
his
unsteady
energies
many
however
of
his
other
friends
longed
in
vain
to
hear
of
that
blaze
of
heroism
by
which
they
anticipated
that
his
appearance
in
the
field
would
be
distinguished
among
his
earliest
proceedings
was
the
equipment
of
forty
suliotes
or
albanians
whom
he
sent
to
marco
botzaris
to
assist
in
the
defence
of
missolonghi
an
adventurer
of
more
daring
would
have
gone
with
them
and
when
the
battle
was
over
in
which
botzaris
fell
he
transmitted
bandages
and
medicines
of
which
he
had
brought
a
large
supply
from
italy
and
pecuniary
succour
to
the
wounded
this
was
considerate
but
there
was
too
much
consideration
in
all
that
he
did
at
this
time
neither
in
unison
with
the
impulses
of
his
natural
character
nor
consistent
with
the
heroic
enthusiasm
with
which
the
admirers
of
his
poetry
imagined
he
was
kindled
in
the
mean
time
he
had
offered
to
advance
one
thousand
dollars
a
month
for
the
succour
of
missolonghi
and
the
troops
with
marco
botzaris
but
the
government
instead
of
accepting
the
offer
intimated
that
they
wished
previously
to
confer
with
him
which
he
interpreted
into
a
desire
to
direct
the
expenditure
of
the
money
to
other
purposes
in
his
opinion
his
lordship
was
probably
not
mistaken
but
his
own
account
of
his
feeling
in
the
business
does
not
tend
to
exalt
the
magnanimity
of
his
attachment
to
the
cause
i
will
take
care
says
he
that
it
is
for
the
public
cause
otherwise
i
will
not
advance
a
para
the
opposition
say
they
want
to
cajole
me
and
the
party
in
power
say
the
others
wish
to
seduce
me
so
between
the
two
i
have
a
difficult
part
to
play
however
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
factions
unless
to
reconcile
them
if
possible
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
that
lord
byron
the
searcher
of
dark
bosoms
could
have
expressed
himself
so
weakly
and
with
such
vanity
but
the
shadow
of
coming
fate
had
already
reached
him
and
his
judgment
was
suffering
in
the
blight
that
had
fallen
on
his
reputation
to
think
of
the
possibility
of
reconciling
two
greek
factions
or
any
factions
implies
a
degree
of
ignorance
of
mankind
which
unless
it
had
been
given
in
his
lordship
own
writing
would
not
have
been
credible
and
as
to
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
factions
for
what
purpose
went
he
to
greece
unless
it
was
to
take
a
part
with
one
of
them
i
abstain
from
saying
what
i
think
of
his
hesitation
in
going
to
the
government
instead
of
sending
two
of
his
associated
adventurers
mr
trelawney
and
mr
hamilton
brown
whom
he
despatched
to
collect
intelligence
as
to
the
real
state
of
things
substituting
their
judgment
for
his
own
when
the
hercules
the
ship
he
chartered
to
carry
him
to
greece
weighed
anchor
he
was
committed
with
the
greeks
and
everything
short
of
unequivocal
folly
he
was
bound
to
have
done
with
and
for
them
his
two
emissaries
or
envoys
proceeded
to
tripolizza
where
they
found
colocotroni
seated
in
the
palace
of
the
late
vizier
velhi
pasha
in
great
power
the
and
galleries
filled
with
armed
men
in
garrison
while
there
was
no
enemy
at
that
time
in
the
morea
able
to
come
against
them
the
greek
chieftains
like
their
classic
predecessors
though
embarked
in
the
same
adventure
were
personal
adversaries
to
each
other
colocotroni
spoke
of
his
compeer
mavrocordato
in
the
very
language
of
agamemnon
when
he
said
that
he
had
declared
to
him
unless
he
desisted
from
his
intrigues
he
would
mount
him
on
an
ass
and
whip
him
out
of
the
morea
and
that
he
had
only
been
restrained
from
doing
so
by
the
representation
of
his
friends
who
thought
it
would
injure
their
common
cause
such
was
the
spirit
of
the
chiefs
of
the
factions
which
lord
byron
thought
it
not
impossible
to
reconcile
at
this
time
missolonghi
was
in
a
critical
state
being
blockaded
both
by
land
and
sea
and
the
report
of
trelawney
to
lord
byron
concerning
it
was
calculated
to
rouse
his
lordship
to
activity
there
have
been
says
he
thirty
battles
fought
and
won
by
the
late
marco
botzaris
and
his
gallant
tribe
of
suliotes
who
are
shut
up
in
missolonghi
if
it
fall
athens
will
be
in
danger
and
thousands
of
throats
cut
a
few
thousand
dollars
would
provide
ships
to
relieve
it
a
portion
of
this
sum
is
raised
and
i
would
coin
my
heart
to
save
this
key
of
greece
bravely
said
but
deserving
of
little
attention
the
fate
of
missolonghi
could
have
had
no
visible
effect
on
that
of
athens
the
distance
between
these
two
places
is
more
than
a
hundred
miles
and
lord
byron
was
well
acquainted
with
the
local
difficulties
of
the
intervening
country
still
it
was
a
point
to
which
the
eyes
of
the
greeks
were
all
at
that
time
directed
and
mavrocordato
then
in
correspondence
with
lord
byron
and
who
was
endeavouring
to
collect
a
fleet
for
the
relief
of
the
place
induced
his
lordship
to
undertake
to
provide
the
money
necessary
for
the
equipment
of
the
fleet
to
the
extent
of
twelve
thousand
pounds
it
was
on
this
occasion
his
lordship
addressed
a
letter
to
the
greek
chiefs
that
deserves
to
be
quoted
for
the
sagacity
with
which
it
suggests
what
may
be
the
conduct
of
the
great
powers
of
christendom
i
must
frankly
confess
says
he
that
unless
union
and
order
are
confirmed
all
hopes
of
a
loan
will
be
in
vain
and
all
the
assistance
which
the
greeks
could
expect
from
abroad
an
assistance
which
might
be
neither
trifling
nor
worthless
will
be
suspended
or
destroyed
and
what
is
worse
the
great
powers
of
europe
of
whom
no
one
was
an
enemy
to
greece
but
seemed
inclined
to
favour
her
in
consenting
to
the
establishment
of
an
independent
power
will
be
persuaded
that
the
greeks
are
unable
to
govern
themselves
and
will
perhaps
undertake
to
arrange
your
disorders
in
such
a
way
as
to
blast
the
brightest
hopes
you
indulge
and
that
are
indulged
by
your
friends
in
the
meantime
lord
byron
was
still
at
the
villa
he
had
hired
in
cephalonia
where
his
conduct
was
rather
that
of
a
spectator
than
an
ally
colonel
stanhope
in
a
letter
of
the
of
november
describes
him
as
having
been
there
about
three
months
and
spending
his
time
exactly
as
every
one
acquainted
with
his
habits
must
have
expected
the
first
six
weeks
he
spent
on
board
a
and
seldom
went
on
shore
except
on
business
since
that
period
he
has
lived
in
a
little
villa
in
the
country
in
absolute
retirement
count
gamba
brother
to
the
guiccioli
being
his
only
companion
such
surely
was
not
exactly
playing
that
part
in
the
greek
cause
which
he
had
taught
the
world
to
look
for
it
is
true
that
the
accounts
received
there
of
the
greek
affairs
were
not
then
favourable
everybody
concurred
in
representing
the
executive
government
as
devoid
of
public
virtue
and
actuated
by
avarice
or
personal
ambition
this
intelligence
was
certainly
not
calculated
to
increase
lord
byron
ardour
and
may
partly
excuse
the
causes
of
his
personal
inactivity
i
say
personal
because
he
had
written
to
london
to
accelerate
the
attempt
to
raise
a
loan
and
at
the
suggestion
of
colonel
stanhope
he
addressed
a
letter
to
mavrocordato
respecting
the
inevitable
consequences
of
their
calamitous
dissensions
the
object
of
this
letter
was
to
induce
a
reconciliation
between
the
rival
factions
or
to
throw
the
odium
of
having
thwarted
the
loan
upon
the
executive
and
thereby
to
degrade
the
members
of
it
in
the
opinion
of
the
people
i
am
very
uneasy
said
his
lordship
to
the
prince
at
hearing
that
the
dissensions
of
greece
still
continue
and
at
a
moment
when
she
might
triumph
over
everything
in
general
as
she
has
triumphed
in
part
greece
is
at
present
placed
between
three
measures
either
to
reconquer
her
liberty
or
to
become
a
dependence
of
the
sovereigns
of
europe
or
to
return
to
a
turkish
province
she
has
already
the
choice
only
of
these
three
alternatives
civil
war
is
but
a
road
which
leads
to
the
two
latter
if
she
is
desirous
of
the
fate
of
wallachia
and
the
crimea
she
may
obtain
it
if
that
of
italy
the
day
after
but
if
she
wishes
to
become
truly
greece
free
and
independent
she
must
resolve
or
she
will
never
again
have
the
opportunity
etc
meanwhile
the
greek
people
became
impatient
for
lord
byron
to
come
among
them
they
looked
forward
to
his
arrival
as
to
the
coming
of
a
messiah
three
boats
were
successively
despatched
for
him
and
two
of
them
returned
one
after
the
other
without
him
on
the
of
december
however
his
lordship
did
at
last
embark

while

byron
was
hesitating
in
the
island
of

about
proceeding
to
greece
an
occurrence
took
place
of
which
much
has
been
made
i
allude
to
the
acquaintance
he
formed
with
a
dr
kennedy
the
publication
of
whose

with
him

has
attracted
some
degree
of
public
attention

afterwards
became
a
student
of
medicine
and
entering

medical
department
of

when

possessed

in

wherever
his

a
taste
for
circulating
pious
tracts
and
zealously
in
distributing
copies
of
the
scriptures
firmly
settled
himself
in
a
conviction
of
the
truth
of
christianity
he
was
eager
to
make
converts
to
his
views
of
the
doctrines
but
whether
he
was
exactly
the
kind
of
apostle
to
achieve
the
conversion
of
lord
byron
may
perhaps
be
doubted
his
sincerity
and
the
disinterestedness
of
his
endeavours
would
secure
to
him
from
his
lordship
an
indulgent
and
even
patient
hearing
but
i
fear
that
without
some
more
effectual
calling
the
arguments
he
appears
to
have
employed
were
not
likely
to
have
made
lord
byron
a
proselyte
his
lordship
was
so
constituted
in
his
mind
and
by
his
temperament
that
nothing
short
of
regeneration
could
have
made
him
a
christian
according
to
the
gospel
of
dr
kennedy
lord
byron
had
but
loose
feelings
in
religion
scarcely
any
his
sensibility
and
a
slight
constitutional
leaning
towards
superstition
and
omens
showed
that
the
sense
of
devotion
was
however
alive
and
awake
within
him
but
with
him
religion
was
a
sentiment
and
the
convictions
of
the
understanding
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
his
creed
that
he
was
deeply
imbued
with
the
essence
of
natural
piety
that
he
often
felt
the
power
and
being
of
a
god
thrilling
in
all
his
frame
and
glowing
in
his
bosom
i
declare
my
thorough
persuasion
and
that
he
believed
in
some
of
the
tenets
and
in
the
philosophy
of
christianity
as
they
influence
the
spirit
and
conduct
of
men
i
am
as
little
disposed
to
doubt
especially
if
those
portions
of
his
works
which
only
trend
towards
the
subject
and
which
bear
the
impression
of
fervour
and
earnestness
may
be
admitted
as
evidence
but
he
was
not
a
member
of
any
particular
church
and
without
a
reconstruction
of
his
mind
and
temperament
i
venture
to
say
he
could
not
have
become
such
not
in
consequence
as
too
many
have
represented
of
any
predilection
either
of
feeling
or
principle
against
christianity
but
entirely
owing
to
an
organic
peculiarity
of
mind
he
reasoned
on
every
topic
by
instinct
rather
than
by
induction
or
any
process
of
logic
and
could
never
be
so
convinced
of
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
an
abstract
proposition
as
to
feel
it
affect
the
current
of
his
actions
he
may
have
assented
to
arguments
without
being
sensible
of
their
truth
merely
because
they
were
not
objectionable
to
his
feelings
at
the
time
and
in
the
same
manner
he
may
have
disputed
even
fair
inferences
from
admitted
premises
if
the
state
of
his
feelings
happened
to
be
indisposed
to
the
subject
i
am
persuaded
nevertheless
that
to
class
him
among
absolute
infidels
were
to
do
injustice
to
his
memory
and
that
he
has
suffered
uncharitably
in
the
opinion
of
the
rigidly
righteous
who
because
he
had
not
attached
himself
to
any
particular
sect
or
congregation
assumed
that
he
was
an
adversary
to
religion
to
claim
for
him
any
credit
as
a
pious
man
would
be
absurd
but
to
suppose
he
had
not
as
deep
an
interest
as
other
men
in
his
soul
health
and
welfare
was
to
impute
to
him
a
nature
which
can
not
exist
being
altogether
a
creature
of
impulses
he
certainly
could
not
be
ever
employed
in
doxologies
or
engaged
in
the
logomachy
of
churchmen
but
he
had
the
sentiment
which
at
a
tamer
age
might
have
made
him
more
ecclesiastical
there
was
as
much
truth
as
joke
in
the
expression
when
he
wrote
i
am
myself
a
moderate
presbyterian
a
mind
constituted
like
that
of
lord
byron
was
little
susceptible
of
impressions
from
the
arguments
of
ordinary
men
it
was
necessary
that
truth
in
visiting
him
should
come
arrayed
in
her
solemnities
and
with
awe
and
reverence
for
her
precursors
acknowledged
superiority
yea
celebrated
wisdom
were
indispensable
to
bespeak
his
sincere
attention
and
without
disparagement
it
may
be
fairly
said
these
were
not
the
attributes
of
dr
kennedy
on
the
contrary
there
was
a
taint
of
cant
about
him
perhaps
he
only
acted
like
those
who
have
it
but
still
he
was
not
exactly
the
dignitary
to
command
unaffected
deference
from
the
shrewd
and
irreverent
author
of
don
juan
the
result
verified
what
ought
to
have
been
the
anticipation
the
doctor
attempt
to
quicken
byron
to
a
sense
of
grace
failed
but
his
lordship
treated
him
with
politeness
the
history
of
the
affair
will
however
be
more
interesting
than
any
reflections
which
it
is
in
my
humble
power
to
offer
some
of
dr
kennedy
acquaintances
wished
to
hear
him
explain
in
a
logical
and
demonstrative
manner
the
evidences
and
doctrines
of
christianity
and
lord
byron
hearing
of
the
intended
meeting
desired
to
be
present
and
was
accordingly
invited
he
attended
but
was
not
present
at
several
others
which
followed
he
however
intimated
to
the
doctor
that
he
would
be
glad
to
converse
with
him
and
the
invitation
was
accepted
on
religion
says
the
doctor
his
lordship
was
in
general
a
hearer
proposing
his
difficulties
and
objections
with
more
fairness
than
could
have
been
expected
from
one
under
similar
circumstances
and
with
so
much
candour
that
they
often
seemed
to
be
proposed
more
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
information
or
satisfactory
answers
than
from
any
other
motive
at
the
first
meeting
dr
kennedy
explained
becomingly
his
views
of
the
subject
and
that
he
had
read
every
work
against
christianity
which
fell
in
his
way
it
was
this
consideration
which
had
induced
him
with
such
confidence
to
enter
upon
the
discussion
knowing
on
the
one
hand
the
strength
of
christianity
and
on
the
other
the
weakness
of
its
assailants
to
show
you
therefore
said
the
doctor
the
grounds
on
which
i
demand
your
attention
to
what
i
may
say
on
the
nature
and
evidence
of
christianity
i
shall
mention
the
names
of
some
of
the
authors
whose
works
i
have
read
or
consulted
when
he
had
mentioned
all
these
names
lord
byron
asked
if
he
had
read
barrow
and
stillingfleet
works
the
doctor
replied
i
have
seen
them
but
i
have
not
read
them
after
a
disquisition
chiefly
relative
to
the
history
of
christianity
dr
kennedy
observed
we
must
on
all
occasions
but
more
particularly
in
fair
and
logical
discussions
with
sceptics
or
deists
make
a
distinction
between
christianity
as
it
is
found
in
the
scriptures
and
the
errors
abuses
and
imperfections
of
christians
themselves
to
this
his
lordship
remarked
that
he
always
had
taken
care
to
make
that
distinction
as
he
knew
enough
of
christianity
to
feel
that
it
was
both
necessary
and
just
the
doctor
remarked
that
the
contrary
was
almost
universally
the
case
with
those
who
doubted
or
denied
the
truth
of
christianity
and
proceeded
to
illustrate
the
statement
he
then
read
a
summary
of
the
fundamental
doctrines
of
christianity
but
he
had
not
proceeded
far
when
he
observed
signs
of
impatience
in
lord
byron
who
inquired
if
these
sentiments
accorded
with
the
doctor
and
being
answered
they
did
and
with
those
of
all
sound
christians
except
in
one
or
two
minor
things
his
lordship
rejoined
that
he
did
not
wish
to
hear
the
opinions
of
others
whose
writings
he
could
read
at
any
time
but
only
his
own
the
doctor
then
read
on
till
coming
to
the
expression
grace
of
god
his
lordship
inquired
what
do
you
mean
by
grace
the
primary
and
fundamental
meaning
of
the
word
replied
the
doctor
somewhat
surprised
at
his
ignorance
i
quote
his
own
language
is
favour
though
it
varies
according
to
the
context
to
express
that
disposition
of
god
which
leads
him
to
grant
a
favour
the
action
of
doing
so
or
the
favour
itself
or
its
effects
on
those
who
receive
it
the
arrogance
of
the
use
of
the
term
ignorance
here
requires
no
animadversion
but
to
suppose
the
greatest
master
then
in
existence
of
the
english
language
not
acquainted
with
the
meaning
of
the
word
when
he
asked
to
be
informed
of
the
meaning
attached
to
it
by
the
individual
making
use
of
it
gives
us
some
insight
into
the
true
character
of
the
teacher
the
doctor
closed
the
book
as
he
perceived
that
lord
byron
as
he
says
had
no
distinct
conception
of
many
of
the
words
used
and
his
lordship
subjoined
what
we
want
is
to
be
convinced
that
the
bible
is
true
because
if
we
can
believe
that
it
will
follow
as
a
matter
of
course
that
we
must
believe
all
the
doctrines
it
contains
the
reply
to
this
was
to
the
effect
that
the
observation
was
partly
just
but
though
the
strongest
evidence
were
produced
of
the
scriptures
being
the
revealed
will
of
god
they
his
lordship
and
others
present
would
still
remain
unbelievers
unless
they
knew
and
comprehended
the
doctrines
contained
in
the
scriptures
this
was
not
conclusive
and
lord
byron
replied
that
they
wished
him
to
prove
that
the
scriptures
were
the
word
of
god
which
the
doctor
with
more
than
apostolic
simplicity
said
that
such
was
his
object
but
he
should
like
to
know
what
they
deemed
the
clearest
course
to
follow
with
that
object
in
view
after
some
farther
conversation
no
other
plan
was
proposed
by
them
says
the
doctor
and
he
adds
they
had
violated
their
engagement
to
hear
me
for
twelve
hours
for
which
i
had
stipulated
this
may
perhaps
satisfy
the
reader
as
to
the
quality
of
the
doctor
understanding
but
as
the
subject
in
its
bearing
touches
lord
byron
character
i
shall
proceed
a
little
farther
into
the
marrow
of
the
matter
the
inculcation
being
finished
for
that
evening
lord
byron
said
that
when
he
was
young
his
mother
brought
him
up
strictly
and
that
he
had
access
to
a
great
many
theological
works
and
remembered
that
he
was
particularly
pleased
with
barrow
writings
and
that
he
also
went
regularly
to
church
he
declared
that
he
was
not
an
infidel
who
denied
the
scriptures
and
wished
to
remain
in
unbelief
on
the
contrary
he
was
desirous
to
believe
as
he
experienced
no
happiness
in
having
his
religious
opinions
so
unsteady
and
unfixed
but
he
could
not
he
added
understand
the
scriptures
those
people
who
conscientiously
believe
i
always
have
respected
and
was
always
disposed
to
trust
in
them
more
than
in
others
a
desultory
conversation
then
ensued
respecting
the
language
and
translations
of
the
scriptures
in
the
course
of
which
his
lordship
remarked
that
scott
in
his
commentary
on
the
bible
did
not
say
that
it
was
the
devil
who
tempted
eve
nor
does
the
bible
say
a
word
about
the
devil
it
is
only
said
that
the
serpent
spoke
and
that
it
was
the
subtlest
of
all
the
beasts
of
the
will
it
be
said
that
truth
and
reason
were
served
by
dr
kennedy
answer
as
beasts
have
not
the
faculty
of
speech
the
just
inference
is
that
the
beast
was
only
an
instrument
made
use
of
by
some
invisible
and
superior
being
the
scriptures
accordingly
tell
us
that
the
devil
is
the
father
of
lie
made
by
the
serpent
to
eve
being
the
first
we
have
on
record
they
call
him
also
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
as
he
was
the
cause
of
the
sentence
of
death
which
was
pronounced
against
adam
and
all
his
posterity
and
still
farther
to
remove
all
doubt
and
to
identify
him
as
the
agent
who
used
the
serpent
as
an
instrument
he
is
called
the
serpent
the
devil
lord
byron
inquired
what
the
doctor
thought
of
the
theory
of
warburton
that
the
jews
had
no
distinct
idea
of
a
future
state
the
doctor
acknowledged
that
he
had
often
seen
but
had
never
read
the
divine
legation
and
yet
he
added
had
warburton
read
his
bible
with
more
simplicity
and
attention
he
would
have
enjoyed
a
more
solid
and
honourable
fame
his
lordship
then
said
that
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
he
had
met
with
was
the
existence
of
so
much
pure
and
unmixed
evil
in
the
world
and
which
he
could
not
reconcile
to
the
idea
of
a
benevolent
creator
the
doctor
set
aside
the
question
as
to
the
origin
of
evil
but
granted
the
extensive
existence
of
evil
in
the
universe
to
remedy
which
he
said
the
gospel
was
proclaimed
and
after
some
of
the
customary
commonplaces
he
ascribed
much
of
the
existing
evil
to
the
slackness
of
christians
in
spreading
the
gospel
is
there
not
said
his
lordship
some
part
of
the
new
testament
where
it
appears
that
the
disciples
were
struck
with
the
state
of
physical
evil
and
made
inquiries
into
the
cause
there
are
two
passages
was
the
reply
the
disciples
inquired
when
they
saw
a
man
who
had
been
born
blind
whether
it
was
owing
to
his
own
or
his
parents
sin
and
after
quoting
the
other
instance
he
concludes
that
moral
and
physical
evil
in
individuals
are
not
always
a
judgment
or
punishment
but
are
intended
to
answer
certain
ends
in
the
government
of
the
world
is
there
not
said
his
lordship
a
prophecy
in
the
new
testament
which
it
is
alleged
has
not
been
fulfilled
although
it
was
declared
that
the
end
of
the
world
would
come
before
the
generation
then
existing
should
pass
away
the
prediction
said
dr
kennedy
related
to
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
which
certainly
took
place
within
the
time
assigned
though
some
of
the
expressions
descriptive
of
the
signs
of
that
remarkable
event
are
of
such
a
nature
as
to
appear
to
apply
to
christ
coming
to
judge
the
world
at
the
end
of
time
his
lordship
then
asked
if
the
doctor
thought
that
there
had
been
fewer
wars
and
persecutions
and
less
slaughter
and
misery
in
the
world
since
the
introduction
of
christianity
than
before
the
doctor
answered
this
by
observing
that
since
christianity
inculcates
peace
and
to
all
men
we
must
always
separate
pure
religion
from
the
abuses
of
which
its
professors
are
guilty
two
other
opinions
were
expressed
by
his
lordship
in
the
conversation
the
doctor
in
speaking
of
the
sovereignty
of
god
had
alluded
to
the
similitude
of
the
potter
and
his
clay
for
his
lordship
said
if
he
were
broken
in
pieces
he
would
say
to
the
potter
why
do
you
treat
me
thus
the
other
was
an
absurdity
it
was
if
the
whole
world
were
going
to
hell
he
would
prefer
going
with
them
than
go
alone
to
heaven
such
was
the
result
of
the
first
council
of
cephalonia
if
one
may
venture
the
allusion
it
is
manifest
without
saying
much
for
lord
byron
ingenuity
that
he
was
fully
a
match
for
the
doctor
and
that
he
was
not
unacquainted
with
the
subject
under
discussion
in
the
next
conversation
lord
byron
repeated
i
have
no
wish
to
reject
christianity
without
investigation
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
desirous
of
believing
but
i
do
not
see
very
much
the
need
of
a
saviour
nor
the
utility
of
prayer
devotion
is
the
affection
of
the
heart
and
this
i
feel
when
i
view
the
wonders
of
creation
i
bow
to
the
majesty
of
heaven
and
when
i
feel
the
enjoyments
of
life
i
feel
grateful
to
god
for
having
bestowed
them
upon
me
upon
this
some
discussion
arose
turning
chiefly
on
the
passage
in
the
third
chapter
of
john
unless
a
man
is
converted
he
can
not
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
which
naturally
led
to
an
explanatory
interlocutor
concerning
new
birth
regeneration
etc
and
thence
diverged
into
the
topics
which
had
been
the
subject
of
the
former
conversation
among
other
things
lord
byron
inquired
if
the
doctor
really
thought
that
the
devil
appeared
before
god
as
is
mentioned
in
the
book
of
job
or
is
it
only
an
allegorical
or
poetical
mode
of
speaking
the
reply
was
i
believe
it
in
the
strict
and
literal
meaning
if
it
be
received
in
a
literal
sense
said
his
lordship
it
gives
me
a
much
higher
idea
of
the
majesty
power
and
wisdom
of
god
to
believe
that
the
devils
themselves
are
at
his
nod
and
are
subject
to
his
control
with
as
much
ease
as
the
elements
of
nature
follow
the
respective
laws
which
his
will
has
assigned
them
this
notion
was
characteristic
and
the
poetical
feeling
in
which
it
originated
when
the
doctor
attempted
to
explain
the
doctrine
of
the
manicheans
was
still
more
distinctly
developed
for
his
lordship
again
expressed
how
much
the
belief
of
the
real
appearance
of
satan
to
hear
and
obey
the
commands
of
god
added
to
his
views
of
the
grandeur
and
majesty
of
the
creator
this
second
conversation
was
more
desultory
than
the
first
religion
was
brought
in
only
incidentally
until
his
lordship
said
i
do
not
reject
the
doctrines
of
christianity
i
want
only
sufficient
proofs
of
it
to
take
up
the
profession
in
earnest
and
i
do
not
believe
myself
to
be
so
bad
a
christian
as
many
of
them
who
preach
against
me
with
the
greatest
fury
many
of
whom
i
have
never
seen
nor
injured
you
have
only
to
examine
the
causes
which
prevent
you
from
being
a
true
believer
said
the
doctor
and
you
will
find
they
are
futile
and
only
tend
to
withhold
you
from
the
enjoyment
of
real
happiness
which
at
present
it
is
impossible
you
can
find
what
then
you
think
me
in
a
very
bad
way
i
certainly
think
you
are
was
the
reply
and
this
i
say
not
on
my
own
authority
but
on
that
of
the
your
lordship
must
be
converted
and
must
be
reformed
before
anything
can
be
said
of
you
except
that
you
are
bad
and
in
a
bad
way
but
replied
his
lordship
i
already
believe
in
predestination
which
i
know
you
believe
and
in
the
depravity
of
the
human
heart
in
general
and
of
my
own
in
particular
thus
you
see
there
are
two
points
in
which
we
agree
i
shall
get
at
the
others
you
can
not
expect
me
to
become
a
perfect
christian
at
once
and
farther
his
lordship
subjoined
predestination
appears
to
me
just
from
my
own
reflection
and
experience
i
am
influenced
in
a
way
which
is
incomprehensible
and
am
led
to
do
things
which
i
never
intended
and
if
there
is
as
we
all
admit
a
supreme
ruler
of
the
universe
and
if
as
you
say
he
has
the
actions
of
the
devils
as
well
as
of
his
own
angels
completely
at
his
command
then
those
influences
or
those
arrangements
of
circumstances
which
lead
us
to
do
things
against
our
will
or
with
must
be
also
under
his
directions
but
i
have
never
entered
into
the
depths
of
the
subject
i
have
contented
myself
with
believing
that
there
is
a
predestination
of
events
and
that
predestination
depends
on
the
will
of
god
dr
kennedy
in
speaking
of
this
second
conversation
bears
testimony
to
the
respectfulness
of
his
lordship
attention
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
which
approached
to
levity
or
anything
that
indicated
a
wish
to
mock
at
religion
though
on
the
other
hand
an
able
dissembler
would
have
done
and
said
all
that
he
did
with
such
feelings
and
intentions
subsequent
to
the
second
conversation
dr
kennedy
asked
a
gentleman
who
was
intimate
with
lord
byron
if
he
really
thought
his
lordship
serious
in
his
desire
to
hear
religion
explained
has
he
exhibited
any
contempt
or
ridicule
at
what
i
have
said
this
gentleman
assured
him
that
he
had
never
heard
byron
allude
to
the
subject
in
any
way
which
could
induce
him
to
suspect
that
he
was
merely
amusing
himself
but
on
the
contrary
he
always
names
you
with
respect
i
do
not
however
think
you
have
made
much
impression
on
him
he
is
just
the
same
fellow
as
before
he
says
he
does
not
know
what
religion
you
are
of
for
you
neither
adhere
to
creeds
nor
councils
it
ought
here
to
be
noticed
as
showing
the
general
opinion
entertained
of
his
lordship
with
respect
to
these
polemical
conversations
that
the
wits
of
the
garrison
made
themselves
merry
with
what
was
going
on
some
of
them
affected
to
believe
or
did
so
that
lord
byron
wish
to
hear
dr
kennedy
proceeded
from
a
desire
to
have
an
accurate
idea
of
the
opinions
and
manners
of
the
methodists
in
order
that
he
might
make
don
juan
become
one
for
a
time
and
so
be
enabled
to
paint
their
conduct
with
greater
accuracy
the
third
conversation
took
place
soon
after
this
comment
had
been
made
on
lord
byron
conduct
the
doctor
inquired
if
his
lordship
had
read
any
of
the
religious
books
he
had
sent
i
have
looked
replied
byron
into
boston
fourfold
state
but
i
have
not
had
time
to
read
it
far
i
am
afraid
it
is
too
deep
for
me
although
there
was
no
systematic
design
on
the
part
of
lord
byron
to
make
dr
kennedy
subservient
to
any
scheme
of
ridicule
yet
it
is
evident
that
he
was
not
so
serious
as
the
doctor
so
meritoriously
desired
i
have
begun
said
his
lordship
very
fairly
i
have
given
some
of
your
tracts
to
fletcher
his
valet
who
is
a
good
sort
of
man
but
still
wants
like
myself
some
reformation
and
i
hope
he
will
spread
them
among
the
other
servants
who
require
it
still
more
bruno
the
physician
and
gamba
are
busy
reading
some
of
the
italian
tracts
and
i
hope
it
will
have
a
good
effect
on
them
the
former
is
rather
too
decided
against
it
at
present
and
too
much
engaged
with
a
spirit
of
enthusiasm
for
his
own
profession
to
attend
to
other
subjects
but
we
must
have
patience
and
we
shall
see
what
has
been
the
result
i
do
not
fail
to
read
from
time
to
time
my
bible
though
not
perhaps
so
much
as
i
should
have
you
begun
to
pray
that
you
may
understand
it
not
yet
i
have
not
arrived
at
that
pitch
of
faith
yet
but
it
may
come
you
are
in
too
great
a
hurry
his
lordship
then
went
to
a
on
which
a
great
number
of
books
were
ranged
and
taking
hold
of
an
octavo
gave
it
to
the
doctor
it
was
illustrations
of
the
moral
government
of
god
by
smith
london
the
author
said
he
proves
that
the
punishment
of
hell
is
not
eternal
it
will
have
a
termination
the
author
replied
the
doctor
is
i
suppose
one
of
the
socinians
who
in
a
short
time
will
try
to
get
rid
of
every
doctrine
in
the
bible
how
did
your
lordship
get
hold
of
this
book
they
sent
it
out
to
me
from
england
to
make
a
convert
of
me
i
suppose
the
arguments
are
strong
drawn
from
the
bible
itself
and
by
showing
that
a
time
will
come
when
every
intelligent
creature
shall
be
supremely
happy
and
eternally
so
it
expunges
that
shocking
doctrine
that
sin
and
misery
will
for
ever
exist
under
the
government
of
god
whose
highest
attribute
is
love
and
goodness
to
my
present
apprehension
it
would
be
a
most
desirable
thing
could
it
be
proved
that
alternately
all
created
beings
were
to
be
happy
this
would
appear
to
be
most
consistent
with
the
nature
of
i
can
not
yield
to
your
doctrine
of
the
eternal
duration
of
author
opinion
is
more
humane
and
i
think
he
supports
it
very
strongly
from
scripture
the
fourth
conversation
was
still
more
desultory
being
carried
on
at
table
amid
company
in
the
course
of
it
lord
byron
however
declared
that
he
was
so
much
of
a
believer
as
to
be
of
opinion
that
there
is
no
contradiction
in
the
scriptures
which
can
not
be
reconciled
by
an
attentive
consideration
and
comparison
of
passages
it
is
needless
to
remark
that
lord
byron
in
the
course
of
these
conversations
was
incapable
of
preserving
a
consistent
seriousness
the
volatility
of
his
humour
was
constantly
leading
him
into
playfulness
and
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
making
a
pun
or
saying
a
quaint
thing
do
you
know
said
he
to
the
doctor
i
am
nearly
reconciled
to
st
paul
for
he
says
there
is
no
difference
between
the
jews
and
the
greeks
and
i
am
exactly
of
the
same
opinion
for
the
character
of
both
is
equally
vile
upon
the
whole
it
must
be
conceded
that
whatever
was
the
degree
of
lord
byron
dubiety
as
to
points
of
faith
and
doctrine
he
could
not
be
accused
of
gross
ignorance
nor
described
as
animated
by
any
hostile
feeling
against
religion
in
this
sketch
of
these
conversations
i
have
restricted
myself
chiefly
to
those
points
which
related
to
his
lordship
own
sentiments
and
belief
it
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
the
concise
limits
of
this
work
to
have
detailed
the
controversies
a
fair
summary
of
what
byron
did
not
believe
what
he
was
disposed
to
believe
but
had
not
satisfied
himself
with
the
evidence
and
what
he
did
believe
seemed
to
be
the
task
i
ought
to
undertake
the
result
confirmed
the
statement
of
his
lordship
religious
condition
given
in
the
preliminary
remarks
which
i
ought
to
mention
were
written
before
i
looked
into
dr
kennedy
book
and
the
statement
is
not
different
from
the
estimate
which
the
conversations
warrant
it
is
true
that
lord
byron
part
in
the
conversations
is
not
very
characteristic
but
the
integrity
of
dr
kennedy
is
a
sufficient
assurance
that
they
are
substantially
correct

took
on

although
the
distance
from
zante
to
missolonghi
is
but
a
few
hours
sail
the
voyage
was
yet
not
without
adventures
missolonghi
as
i
have
already
mentioned
was
then
blockaded
by
the
turks
and
some
address
was
necessary
on
that
account
to
effect

times

his
lordship
gives
an
account
of
what
took

it
is
very
characteristic

therefore

my
dear
stanhope
we
are
just
arrived
here
that
is
part
of
my
people
and
i
with
some
things
and
which
it
may
be
as
well
not
to
specify
in
a

which
has
a
risk
of
being
intercepted

you
understand

taken
by
the
turkish
frigates
and
my
party
and
myself
in
another
boat
have
had
a
narrow
escape
last
night
being
close
under
their
stern
and
hailed
but
we
would
not
answer
and
bore
away
as
well
as
this
morning
here
we
are
with
sun
and
charming
weather
within
a
pretty
little
port
enough
but
whether
our
turkish
friends
may
not
send
in
their
boats
and
take
us
out
for
we
have
no
arms
except
two
carbines
and
some
pistols
and
i
suspect
not
more
than
four
fighting
people
on
board
is
another
question
especially
if
we
remain
long
here
since
we
are
blocked
out
of
missolonghi
by
the
direct
entrance
you
had
better
send
my
friend
george
drake
and
a
body
of
suliotes
to
escort
us
by
land
or
by
the
canals
with
all
convenient
speed
gamba
and
our
bombard
are
taken
into
patras
i
suppose
and
we
must
take
a
turn
at
the
turks
to
get
them
out
but
where
the
devil
is
the
fleet
gone
the
greek
i
mean
leaving
us
to
get
in
without
the
least
intimation
to
take
heed
that
the
moslems
were
out
again
make
my
respects
to
mavrocordato
and
say
that
i
am
here
at
his
disposal
i
am
uneasy
at
being
here
we
are
very
etc
b
the
bombard
was
twelve
miles
out
when
taken
at
least
so
it
appeared
to
us
if
taken
she
actually
be
for
it
is
not
certain
and
we
had
to
escape
from
another
vessel
that
stood
right
in
between
us
and
the
port
colonel
stanhope
on
receiving
this
despatch
which
was
carried
to
him
by
two
of
lord
byron
servants
sent
two
armed
boats
and
a
company
of
suliotes
to
escort
his
lordship
to
missolonghi
where
he
arrived
on
the
of
january
and
was
received
with
military
honours
and
the
most
enthusiastic
demonstrations
of
popular
joy
no
mark
of
respect
which
the
greeks
could
think
of
was
omitted
the
ships
fired
a
salute
as
he
passed
prince
mavrocordato
and
all
the
authorities
with
the
troops
and
the
population
met
him
on
his
landing
and
accompanied
him
to
the
house
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
amid
the
shouts
of
the
multitude
and
the
discharge
of
cannon
in
the
meantime
count
gamba
and
his
companions
being
taken
before
yusuff
pasha
at
patras
expected
to
share
the
fate
of
certain
unfortunate
prisoners
whom
that
stern
chief
had
sacrificed
the
preceding
year
at
prevesa
and
their
fears
would
probably
have
been
realised
but
for
the
intrepid
presence
of
mind
displayed
by
the
count
who
assuming
a
haughty
style
accused
the
ottoman
captain
of
the
frigate
of
a
breach
of
neutrality
in
detaining
a
vessel
under
english
colours
and
concluded
by
telling
the
pasha
that
he
might
expect
the
vengeance
of
the
british
government
in
thus
interrupting
a
nobleman
who
was
merely
on
his
travels
and
bound
to
calamata
perhaps
however
another
circumstance
had
quite
as
much
influence
with
the
pasha
as
this
bravery
in
the
master
of
the
vessel
he
recognised
a
person
who
had
saved
his
life
in
the
black
sea
fifteen
years
before
and
in
consequence
not
only
consented
to
the
release
but
treated
the
whole
of
the
passengers
with
the
utmost
attention
and
even
urged
them
to
take
a
day
shooting
in
the
neighbourhood
the
first
measure
which
his
lordship
attempted
after
his
arrival
was
to
mitigate
the
ferocity
with
which
the
war
was
carried
on
one
of
the
objects
as
he
explained
to
my
friend
who
visited
him
at
genoa
which
induced
him
to
embark
in
the
cause
and
it
happened
that
the
very
day
he
reached
the
town
was
signalised
by
his
rescuing
a
turk
who
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
some
greek
sailors
this
man
was
clothed
by
his
lordship
orders
and
sent
over
to
patras
and
soon
after
count
gamba
release
hearing
that
four
other
turks
were
prisoners
in
missolonghi
he
requested
that
they
might
be
placed
in
his
hands
which
was
immediately
granted
these
he
also
sent
to
patras
with
a
letter
addressed
to
yusuff
expressing
his
hope
that
the
prisoners
taken
on
both
sides
would
be
treated
with
humanity
this
act
was
followed
by
another
equally
praiseworthy
a
greek
cruiser
having
captured
a
turkish
boat
in
which
there
was
a
number
of
passengers
chiefly
women
and
children
they
were
also
placed
at
the
disposal
of
his
lordship
at
his
particular
request
captain
parry
has
given
a
description
of
the
scene
between
lord
byron
and
that
multitude
of
mothers
and
children
too
interesting
to
be
omitted
here
i
was
summoned
to
attend
him
and
receive
his
orders
that
everything
should
be
done
which
might
contribute
to
their
comfort
he
was
seated
on
a
cushion
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
the
women
and
children
were
standing
before
him
with
their
eyes
fixed
steadily
on
him
and
on
his
right
hand
was
his
interpreter
who
was
extracting
from
the
women
a
narrative
of
their
sufferings
one
of
them
apparently
about
thirty
years
of
age
possessing
great
vivacity
and
whose
manners
and
dress
though
she
was
then
dirty
and
disfigured
indicated
that
she
was
superior
in
rank
and
condition
to
her
companions
was
spokeswoman
for
the
whole
i
admired
the
good
order
the
others
preserved
never
interfering
with
the
explanation
or
interrupting
the
single
speaker
i
also
admired
the
rapid
manner
in
which
the
interpreter
explained
everything
they
said
so
as
to
make
it
almost
appear
that
there
was
but
one
speaker
after
a
short
time
it
was
evident
that
what
lord
byron
was
hearing
affected
his
feelings
his
countenance
changed
his
colour
went
and
came
and
i
thought
he
was
ready
to
weep
but
he
had
on
all
occasions
a
ready
and
peculiar
knack
in
turning
conversation
from
any
disagreeable
or
unpleasant
subject
and
he
had
recourse
to
this
expedient
he
rose
up
suddenly
and
turning
round
on
his
heel
as
was
his
wont
he
said
something
to
his
interpreter
who
immediately
repeated
it
to
the
women
all
eyes
were
immediately
fixed
on
me
and
one
of
the
party
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
spoke
very
warmly
lord
byron
seemed
satisfied
and
said
they
might
retire
the
women
all
slipped
off
their
shoes
in
an
instant
and
going
up
to
his
lordship
each
in
succession
accompanied
by
their
children
kissed
his
hand
fervently
invoked
in
the
turkish
manner
a
blessing
both
on
his
hand
and
heart
and
then
quitted
the
room
this
was
too
much
for
lord
byron
and
he
turned
his
face
away
to
conceal
his
emotion
a
vessel
was
then
hired
and
the
whole
of
them
to
the
number
of
were
sent
to
prevesa
provided
with
every
requisite
for
their
comfort
during
the
passage
these
instances
of
humanity
excited
a
sympathy
among
the
turks
the
governor
of
prevesa
thanked
his
lordship
and
assured
him
that
he
would
take
care
that
equal
attention
should
be
in
future
paid
to
the
greeks
who
might
fall
into
his

imbecility
of
the

for

of

the
arrival
of
lord
byron
at
missolonghi
was
not
only
hailed
as
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
greece
but
as
the
beginning
of
a
new
cycle
in
his
own
extraordinary
life
his
natural
indolence
disappeared
the
sardanapalian
sloth
was
thrown
off
and
he
took
a
station
in
the
van
of
her
efforts
that
bespoke
heroic
achievement
after
paying
the
fleet
which
indeed
had
only
come
out
in
the
expectation
of
receiving
the
arrears
from
the
loan
he
had
promised
to
mavrocordato
he
resolved
to
form
a
brigade
of
suliotes
five
hundred
of
the
remains
of
marco
botzaris
gallant
followers
were
accordingly
taken
into
his
pay
he
burns
with
military
ardour
and
chivalry
says
colonel
stanhope
and
will
proceed
with
the
expedition
to
lepanto
but
the
expedition
was
delayed
by
causes
which
ought
to
have
been
foreseen
the
suliotes
conceiving
that
in
his
lordship
they
had
found
a
patron
whose
wealth
and
generosity
were
equally
boundless
refused
to
quit
missolonghi
till
their
arrears
were
paid
savage
in
the
field
and
untamable
in
the
city
they
became
insubordinate
and
mercenary
nor
was
their
conduct
without
excuse
they
had
long
defended
the
town
with
untired
bravery
their
families
had
been
driven
into
it
in
the
most
destitute
condition
and
all
the
hopes
that
had
led
them
to
take
up
arms
were
still
distant
and
prospective
besides
mavrocordato
unlike
the
other
grecian
captains
having
no
troops
of
his
own
affected
to
regard
these
mercenaries
as
allies
and
was
indulgent
to
their
excesses
the
town
was
overawed
by
their
turbulence
conflicts
took
place
in
the
street
riot
and
controversy
everywhere
prevailed
and
blood
was
shed
lord
byron
undisciplined
spirit
could
ill
brook
delay
he
partook
of
the
general
vehemence
and
lost
the
power
of
discerning
the
comparative
importance
both
of
measures
and
things
he
was
out
of
his
element
confusion
thickened
around
him
his
irritability
grew
into
passion
and
there
was
the
rush
and
haste
the
oblivion
and
alarm
of
fatality
in
all
he
undertook
and
suggested
one
day
a
party
of
german
adventurers
reached
the
fortress
so
demoralized
by
hardships
that
few
of
them
were
fit
for
service
it
was
intended
to
form
a
corps
of
artillery
and
these
men
were
destined
for
that
branch
of
the
service
but
their
condition
was
such
that
stanhope
doubted
the
practicability
of
carrying
the
measure
into
effect
at
that
time
he
had
promised
to
contribute
a
hundred
pounds
to
their
equipment
byron
attributed
the
objections
to
reluctance
to
pay
the
money
and
threatened
him
if
it
were
refused
with
a
punishment
new
in
grecian
war
to
libel
him
in
the
greek
chronicle
a
newspaper
which
stanhope
had
recently
established
it
is
however
not
easy
to
give
a
correct
view
of
the
state
of
affairs
at
that
epoch
in
missolonghi
all
parties
seem
to
have
been
deplorably
incompetent
to
understand
the
circumstances
in
which
they
were
placed
the
condition
of
the
greeks
and
that
their
exigencies
required
only
physical
and
military
means
they
talked
of
newspapers
and
types
and
libels
as
if
the
moral
instruments
of
civil
exhortation
were
adequate
to
wrench
the
independence
of
greece
from
the
bloody
grasp
of
the
ottoman
no
wonder
that
byron
accustomed
to
the
management
only
of
his
own
fancies
was
fluttered
amid
the
conflicts
of
such
riot
and
controversy
his
situation
at
this
period
was
indeed
calculated
to
inspire
pity
had
he
survived
it
might
instead
of
awakening
the
derision
of
history
have
supplied
to
himself
materials
for
another
canto
of
don
juan
i
shall
select
one
instance
of
his
afflictions
the
captain
of
a
british
came
to
missolonghi
to
demand
an
equivalent
for
an
ionian
boat
which
had
been
taken
in
the
act
of
going
out
of
the
gulf
of
lepanto
with
provisions
and
arms
the
greek
fleet
at
that
time
blockading
the
port
consisted
of
five
brigs
and
the
turks
had
fourteen
vessels
of
war
in
the
gulf
the
captain
maintained
that
the
british
government
recognised
no
blockade
which
was
not
efficient
and
that
the
efficiency
depended
on
the
numerical
superiority
of
cannon
on
this
principle
he
demanded
restitution
of
the
property
mavrocordato
offered
to
submit
the
case
to
the
decision
of
the
british
government
but
the
captain
would
only
give
him
four
hours
to
consider
the
indemnification
was
granted
lord
byron
conducted
the
business
in
behalf
of
the
captain
in
the
evening
conversing
with
stanhope
on
the
subject
the
colonel
said
the
affair
was
conducted
in
a
bullying
manner
his
lordship
started
into
a
passion
and
contended
that
law
justice
and
equity
had
nothing
to
do
with
politics
that
may
be
replied
stanhope
but
i
will
never
lend
myself
to
injustice
his
lordship
then
began
to
attack
jeremy
bentham
the
colonel
complained
of
such
illiberality
as
to
make
personal
attacks
on
that
gentleman
before
a
friend
who
held
him
in
high
estimation
i
only
attack
his
public
principles
replied
byron
which
are
mere
theories
but
dangerous
injurious
to
spain
and
calculated
to
do
great
mischief
in
greece
stanhope
vindicated
bentham
and
said
he
possesses
a
truly
british
heart
but
your
lordship
after
professing
liberal
principles
from
boyhood
have
when
called
upon
to
act
proved
yourself
a
turk
what
proofs
have
you
of
this
your
conduct
in
endeavouring
to
crush
the
press
by
declaiming
against
it
to
mavrocordato
and
your
general
abuse
of
liberal
principles
if
i
had
held
up
my
finger
retorted
his
lordship
i
could
have
crushed
the
press
with
all
this
power
said
stanhope
which
by
the
way
you
never
possessed
you
went
to
the
prince
and
poisoned
his
ear
lord
byron
then
disclaimed
against
the
liberals
what
liberals
cried
stanhope
did
you
borrow
your
notions
of
freemen
from
the
italians
no
from
the
hunts
cartwrights
and
such
and
yet
your
lordship
presented
cartwright
reform
bill
and
aided
hunt
by
praising
his
poetry
and
giving
him
the
sale
of
your
works
you
are
worse
than
wilson
exclaimed
byron
and
should
quit
the
army
i
am
a
mere
soldier
replied
stanhope
but
never
will
i
abandon
my
principles
our
principles
are
diametrically
opposite
so
let
us
avoid
the
subject
if
lord
byron
acts
up
to
his
professions
he
will
be
the
greatest
if
not
the
meanest
of
mankind
my
character
said
his
lordship
i
hope
does
not
depend
on
your
assertions
no
your
genius
has
immortalized
you
the
worst
will
not
deprive
you
of
fame
lord
byron
then
rejoined
well
you
shall
see
judge
of
me
by
my
acts
and
bidding
the
colonel
good
night
who
took
up
the
light
to
conduct
him
to
the
passage
he
added
what
hold
up
a
light
to
a
turk
such
were
the
franklins
the
washingtons
and
the
hamiltons
who
undertook

the

abandoned
byron
dejected
a
wild
diplomatic
scheme
three
days
after
the
conversation
related
in
the
preceding
chapter
byron
was
officially
placed
in
the
command
of
about
three
thousand
men
destined
for
the
attack
on
lepanto
but
the
suliotes
remained
refractory
and
refused
to
quit
their
quarters
his
lordship
however
employed
an
argument
which
proved
effectual
he
told
them
that
if
they
did
not
obey
his
commands
he
would
discharge
them
from
his
service
but
the
impediments
were
not
to
be
surmounted
in
less
than
a
week
it
was
formally
reported
to
byron
that
missolonghi
could
not
furnish
the
means
of
undertaking
the
siege
of
lepanto
upon
which
his
lordship
proposed
that
lepanto
should
be
only
blockaded
by
two
thousand
men
before
any
actual
step
was
however
taken
two
spies
came
in
with
a
report
that
the
albanians
in
garrison
at
lepanto
had
seized
the
citadel
and
were
determined
to
surrender
it
to
his
lordship
still
the
expedition
lingered
at
last
on
the
of
february
six
weeks
after
byron
arrival
at
missolonghi
it
was
determined
that
an
advanced
guard
of
three
hundred
soldiers
under
the
command
of
count
gamba
should
march
for
lepanto
and
that
lord
byron
with
the
main
body
should
follow
the
suliotes
were
however
still
exorbitant
calling
for
fresh
contributions
for
themselves
and
their
families
his
troubles
were
increasing
and
every
new
rush
of
the
angry
tide
rose
nearer
and
nearer
his
heart
still
his
fortitude
enabled
him
to
preserve
an
outward
show
of
equanimity
but
on
the
very
day
after
the
determination
had
been
adopted
to
send
forward
the
advanced
guard
his
constitution
gave
way
he
was
sitting
in
colonel
stanhope
room
talking
jestingly
according
to
his
wonted
manner
with
captain
parry
when
his
eyes
and
forehead
occasionally
discovered
that
he
was
agitated
by
strong
feelings
on
a
sudden
he
complained
of
a
weakness
in
one
of
his
legs
he
rose
but
finding
himself
unable
to
walk
called
for
assistance
he
then
fell
into
a
violent
nervous
convulsion
and
was
placed
upon
a
bed
while
the
fit
lasted
his
face
was
hideously
distorted
but
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
the
convulsion
ceased
and
he
began
to
recover
his
senses
his
speech
returned
and
he
soon
rose
apparently
well
during
the
struggle
his
strength
was
preternaturally
augmented
and
when
it
was
over
he
behaved
with
his
usual
firmness
i
conceive
says
colonel
stanhope
that
this
fit
was
occasioned
by
the
mind
of
byron
is
like
a
volcano
it
is
full
of
fire
wrath
and
combustibles
and
when
this
matter
comes
to
be
strongly
agitated
the
explosion
is
dreadful
with
respect
to
the
causes
which
produced
the
excess
of
feeling
they
are
beyond
my
reach
except
one
great
cause
the
provoking
conduct
of
the
suliotes
a
few
days
after
this
distressing
incident
a
new
occurrence
arose
which
materially
disturbed
the
tranquillity
of
byron
a
suliote
accompanied
by
the
son
a
little
boy
of
marco
botzaris
with
another
man
walked
into
the
seraglio
a
kind
of
citadel
which
had
been
used
as
a
barrack
for
the
suliotes
and
out
of
which
they
had
been
ejected
with
difficulty
when
it
was
required
for
the
reception
of
stores
and
the
establishment
of
a
laboratory
the
sentinel
ordered
them
back
but
the
suliote
advanced
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
a
german
pushed
him
back
the
suliote
struck
the
sergeant
they
closed
and
struggled
the
suliote
drew
his
pistol
the
german
wrenched
it
from
him
and
emptied
the
pan
at
this
moment
a
swedish
adventurer
captain
sass
seeing
the
quarrel
ordered
the
suliote
to
be
taken
to
the
the
suliote
would
have
departed
but
the
german
still
held
him
the
swede
drew
his
sabre
the
suliote
his
other
pistol
the
swede
struck
him
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
the
suliote
unsheathed
his
ataghan
and
nearly
cut
off
the
left
arm
of
his
antagonist
and
then
shot
him
through
the
head
the
other
suliotes
would
not
deliver
up
their
comrade
for
he
was
celebrated
among
them
for
distinguished
bravery
the
workmen
in
the
laboratory
refused
to
work
they
required
to
be
sent
home
to
england
declaring
they
had
come
out
to
labour
peaceably
and
not
to
be
exposed
to
assassination
these
untoward
occurrences
deeply
vexed
byron
and
there
was
no
mind
of
sufficient
energy
with
him
to
control
the
increasing
disorders
but
though
convinced
as
indeed
he
had
been
persuaded
from
the
beginning
in
his
own
mind
that
he
could
not
render
any
assistance
to
the
cause
beyond
mitigating
the
ferocious
spirit
in
which
the
war
was
conducted
his
pride
and
honour
would
not
allow
him
to
quit
greece
in
a
letter
written
soon
after
his
first
attack
he
says
i
am
a
good
deal
better
though
of
course
weakly
the
leeches
took
too
much
blood
from
my
temples
the
day
after
and
there
was
some
difficulty
in
stopping
it
but
i
have
been
up
daily
and
out
in
boats
or
on
horseback
i
have
taken
a
warm
bath
and
live
as
temperately
as
can
well
be
without
any
liquid
but
water
and
without
any
animal
food
then
adverting
to
the
turbulences
of
the
suliotes
he
adds
but
i
still
hope
better
things
and
will
stand
by
the
cause
as
long
as
my
health
and
circumstances
will
permit
me
to
be
supposed
useful
subsequently
when
pressed
to
leave
the
marshy
and
deleterious
air
of
missolonghi
he
replied
still
more
forcibly
i
can
not
quit
greece
while
there
is
a
chance
of
my
being
of
even
supposed
utility
there
is
a
stake
worth
millions
such
as
i
am
and
while
i
can
stand
at
all
i
must
stand
by
the
cause
while
i
say
this
i
am
aware
of
the
difficulties
and
dissensions
and
defects
of
the
greeks
themselves
but
allowance
must
be
made
for
them
by
all
reasonable
people
after
this
attack
of
epilepsy
lord
byron
because
disinclined
to
pursue
his
scheme
against
lepanto
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
in
his
circumstances
it
was
impracticable
for
although
the
suliotes
repented
of
their
insubordination
they
yet
had
an
objection
to
the
service
and
said
they
would
not
fight
against
stone
walls
all
thought
of
the
expedition
was
in
consequence
abandoned
and
the
destinies
of
poor
byron
were
hastening
to
their
consummation
he
began
to
complain
in
speaking
to
parry
one
day
of
the
greek
committee
in
london
he
said
i
have
been
grossly
by
the
committee
in
italy
mr
blaquiere
their
agent
informed
me
that
every
requisite
supply
would
be
forwarded
with
all
despatch
i
was
disposed
to
come
to
greece
but
i
hastened
my
departure
in
consequence
of
earnest
solicitations
no
time
was
to
be
lost
i
was
told
and
mr
blaquiere
instead
of
waiting
on
me
at
his
return
from
greece
left
a
paltry
note
which
gave
me
no
information
whatever
if
ever
i
meet
with
him
i
shall
not
fail
to
mention
my
surprise
at
his
conduct
but
it
has
been
all
of
a
piece
i
wish
the
acting
committee
had
had
some
of
the
trouble
which
has
fallen
on
me
since
my
arrival
here
they
would
have
been
more
prompt
in
their
proceedings
and
would
have
known
better
what
the
country
stood
in
need
of
they
would
not
have
delayed
the
supplies
a
day
nor
have
sent
out
german
officers
poor
fellows
to
starve
at
missolonghi
but
for
my
assistance
i
am
a
plain
man
and
can
not
comprehend
the
use
of
to
a
people
who
do
not
read
here
the
committee
have
sent
supplies
of
maps
i
suppose
that
i
may
teach
the
young
mountaineers
geography
here
are
without
and
it
is
a
chance
if
we
can
find
anybody
in
greece
to
blow
them
books
are
sent
to
people
who
want
guns
they
ask
for
swords
and
the
committee
give
them
the
lever
of
a
press
my
future
intentions
continued
his
lordship
as
to
greece
may
be
explained
in
a
few
words
i
will
remain
here
until
she
is
secure
against
the
turks
or
till
she
has
fallen
under
their
power
all
my
income
shall
be
spent
in
her
service
but
unless
driven
by
some
great
necessity
i
will
not
touch
a
farthing
of
the
sum
intended
for
my
sister
children
whatever
i
can
accomplish
with
my
income
and
my
personal
exertions
shall
be
cheerfully
done
when
greece
is
secure
against
external
enemies
i
will
leave
the
greeks
to
settle
their
government
as
they
like
one
service
more
and
an
eminent
service
it
will
be
i
think
i
may
perform
for
them
you
parry
shall
have
a
schooner
built
for
me
or
i
will
buy
a
vessel
the
greeks
shall
invest
me
with
the
character
of
their
ambassador
or
agent
i
will
go
to
the
united
states
and
procure
that
free
and
enlightened
government
to
set
the
example
of
recognising
the
federation
of
greece
as
an
independent
state
this
done
england
must
follow
the
example
and
then
the
fate
of
greece
will
be
permanently
fixed
and
she
will
enter
into
all
her
rights
as
a
member
of
the
great
commonwealth
of
christian
europe
this
intention
will
to
all
who
have
ever
looked
at
the
effects
of
fortune
on
individuals
sufficiently
show
that
byron
part
in
the
world
was
nearly
done
had
he
lived
and
recovered
health
it
might
have
proved
that
he
was
then
only
in
another
lunation
his
first
was
when
he
passed
from
poesy
to
heroism
but
as
it
was
it
has
only
served
to
show
that
his
mind
had
suffered
by
the
decadency
of
his
circumstances
and
how
much
the
idea
of
weakly
entered
into
all
his
plans
the
business
was
secondary
to
the
style
in
which
it
should
be
performed
building
a
vessel
why
think
of
the
conveyance
at
all
as
if
the
means
of
going
to
america
were
so
scarce
that
there
might
be
difficulty
in
finding
them
but
his
mind
was
passing
from
him
the
intention
was
unsound
a
fantasy
a
dream
of
bravery
in
old
age
begotten
of
the
erroneous
supposition
that
the
cabinets
of
christendom
would
remain
unconcerned
spectators
of
the
triumph
of
the
greeks
or
even
of
any
very
long
procrastination
of
their
struggle
chapter
xlvii
the
last
illness
and
death
of
lord
byron
his
last
poem
although
in
common
parlance
it
may
be
said
that
after
the
attack
of
epilepsy
lord
byron
general
health
did
not
appear
to
have
been
essentially
impaired
the
appearance
was
fallacious
his
constitution
had
received
a
vital
shock
and
the
exciting
causes
vexation
and
confusion
continued
to
exasperate
his
irritation
on
the
of
march
he
complained
of
frequent
vertigoes
which
made
him
feel
as
though
he
were
intoxicated
but
no
effectual
means
were
taken
to
remove
these
portentous
symptoms
and
he
regularly
enjoyed
his
daily
exercise
sometimes
in
boats
but
oftener
on
horseback
his
physician
thought
him
convalescent
his
mind
however
was
in
constant
excitement
it
rested
not
even
during
sleep
on
the
of
april
while
sailing
he
was
overtaken
by
the
rain
and
got
very
wet
on
his
return
home
he
changed
the
whole
of
his
dress
but
he
had
been
too
long
in
his
wet
clothes
and
the
stamina
of
his
constitution
being
shaken
could
not
withstand
the
effects
in
little
more
than
two
hours
he
was
seized
with
rigors
fever
and
rheumatic
pains
during
the
night
however
he
slept
in
his
accustomed
manner
but
in
the
morning
he
complained
of
pains
and
headache
still
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
going
out
on
horseback
in
the
afternoon
it
was
for
the
last
time
on
returning
home
he
observed
to
one
of
the
servants
that
the
saddle
was
not
perfectly
dry
from
having
been
so
wet
the
day
before
and
that
he
thought
it
had
made
him
worse
he
soon
after
became
affected
with
almost
constant
shivering
sudorific
medicines
were
administered
and
proposed
but
though
he
took
the
drugs
he
objected
to
the
bleeding
another
physician
was
in
consequence
called
in
to
see
if
the
rheumatic
fever
could
be
appeased
without
the
loss
of
blood
this
doctor
approved
of
the
medicines
prescribed
and
was
not
opposed
to
the
opinion
that
bleeding
was
necessary
but
said
it
might
be
deferred
till
the
next
day
on
the
he
seemed
rather
better
but
the
medicines
had
produced
no
effect
on
the
he
was
confined
to
bed
with
fever
and
his
illness
appeared
to
be
increasing
he
was
very
low
and
complained
of
not
having
had
any
sleep
during
the
night
but
the
medical
gentlemen
saw
no
cause
for
alarm
dr
bruno
his
own
physician
again
proposed
bleeding
the
stranger
still
however
thought
it
might
be
deferred
and
byron
himself
was
opposed
to
it
you
will
die
said
dr
bruno
if
you
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
bled
you
wish
to
get
the
reputation
of
curing
my
disease
replied
his
lordship
that
is
why
you
tell
me
it
is
so
serious
but
i
will
not
permit
you
to
bleed
me
on
the
he
sat
up
for
some
time
after
a
sleepless
night
and
still
complained
of
pain
in
his
bones
and
head
on
the
he
also
left
his
bed
the
fever
was
less
but
the
debility
greater
and
the
pain
in
his
head
was
undiminished
his
valet
became
alarmed
and
doubtful
of
the
skill
of
the
doctors
around
him
entreated
permission
to
send
to
zante
for
an
english
physician
of
greater
reputation
his
lordship
desired
him
to
consult
the
others
which
he
did
and
they
told
him
there
was
no
occasion
to
call
in
any
person
as
they
hoped
all
would
be
well
in
a
few
days
his
lordship
now
began
to
doubt
if
his
disease
was
understood
and
remarked
repeatedly
in
the
course
of
this
day
that
he
was
sure
the
doctors
did
not
understand
it
then
my
lord
said
fletcher
his
valet
have
other
advice
they
tell
me
rejoined
his
lordship
that
it
is
only
a
common
cold
which
you
know
i
have
had
a
thousand
times
i
am
sure
you
never
had
one
of
so
serious
a
nature
i
think
i
never
had
fletcher
then
went
again
to
the
physicians
and
repeated
his
solicitations
that
the
doctor
in
zante
might
be
sent
for
but
was
again
assured
that
his
master
would
be
better
in
two
or
three
days
at
length
the
doctor
who
had
too
easily
consented
to
the
postponement
of
the
bleeding
seeing
the
prognostications
of
dr
bruno
more
and
more
confirmed
urged
the
necessity
of
bleeding
and
of
no
longer
delay
this
convinced
byron
who
was
himself
greatly
averse
to
the
operation
that
they
did
not
understand
his
case
on
the
his
lordship
felt
the
pains
abated
insomuch
that
he
was
able
to
transact
some
business
on
the
he
wrote
a
letter
but
towards
the
evening
he
became
worse
and
a
pound
of
blood
was
taken
from
him
still
the
disease
was
making
progress
but
dr
bruno
did
not
yet
seem
much
alarmed
on
the
contrary
he
thought
were
more
blood
removed
his
recovery
was
certain
fletcher
immediately
told
his
master
urging
him
to
comply
with
the
doctor
wishes
i
fear
said
his
lordship
they
know
nothing
about
my
disorder
but
and
he
stretched
out
his
arm
here
take
my
arm
and
do
whatever
you
like
on
the
his
countenance
was
changed
during
the
night
he
had
become
weaker
and
a
slight
degree
of
delirium
in
which
he
raved
of
fighting
had
come
on
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
was
bled
twice
in
the
morning
and
at
two
in
the
afternoon
the
bleeding
on
both
occasions
was
followed
by
fainting
fits
on
this
day
he
said
to
fletcher
i
can
not
sleep
and
you
well
know
i
have
not
been
able
to
sleep
for
more
than
a
week
i
know
that
a
man
can
only
be
a
certain
time
without
sleep
and
then
he
must
go
mad
without
anyone
being
able
to
save
him
and
i
would
ten
times
sooner
shoot
myself
than
be
mad
for
i
am
not
afraid
of
dying
i
am
more
fit
to
die
than
people
think
on
the
his
lordship
first
began
to
dread
that
his
fate
was
inevitable
i
fear
said
he
to
fletcher
you
and
tita
will
be
ill
by
sitting
up
constantly
night
and
day
and
he
appeared
much
dissatisfied
with
his
medical
treatment
fletcher
again
entreated
permission
to
send
for
dr
thomas
at
zante
do
so
but
be
quick
said
his
lordship
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
let
you
do
so
before
as
i
am
sure
they
have
mistaken
my
disease
write
yourself
for
i
know
they
would
not
like
to
see
other
doctors
here
not
a
moment
was
lost
in
executing
the
order
and
on
fletcher
informing
the
doctors
what
he
had
done
they
said
it
was
right
as
they
now
began
to
be
afraid
themselves
have
you
sent
said
his
lordship
when
fletcher
returned
to
i
have
my
lord
you
have
done
well
for
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
from
that
time
his
lordship
grew
every
hour
weaker
and
weaker
and
he
had
occasional
flights
of
delirium
in
the
intervals
he
was
however
quite
and
said
to
fletcher
i
now
begin
to
think
i
am
seriously
ill
and
in
case
i
should
be
taken
off
suddenly
i
wish
to
give
you
several
directions
which
i
hope
you
will
be
particular
in
seeing
executed
fletcher
in
reply
expressed
his
hope
that
he
would
live
many
years
and
execute
them
himself
no
it
is
now
nearly
over
i
must
tell
you
all
without
losing
a
moment
shall
i
go
my
lord
and
fetch
pen
ink
and
paper
oh
my
god
no
you
will
lose
too
much
time
and
i
have
it
not
to
spare
for
my
time
is
now
short
now
pay
attention
you
will
be
provided
for
i
beseech
you
my
lord
to
proceed
with
things
of
more
consequence
his
lordship
then
added
oh
my
poor
dear
child
my
dear
ada
my
god
could
i
have
but
seen
her
give
her
my
blessing
and
my
dear
sister
augusta
and
her
children
and
you
will
go
to
lady
byron
and
say
tell
her
are
friends
with
her
he
appeared
to
be
greatly
affected
at
this
moment
his
voice
failed
and
only
words
could
be
caught
at
intervals
but
he
kept
muttering
something
very
seriously
for
some
time
and
after
raising
his
voice
said
fletcher
now
if
you
do
not
execute
every
order
which
i
have
given
you
i
will
torment
you
hereafter
if
possible
this
little
speech
is
the
last
characteristic
expression
which
escaped
from
the
dying
man
he
knew
fletcher
superstitious
tendency
and
it
can
not
be
questioned
that
the
threat
was
the
last
feeble
flash
of
his
prankfulness
the
faithful
valet
replied
in
consternation
that
he
had
not
understood
one
word
of
what
his
lordship
had
been
saying
oh
my
god
was
the
reply
then
all
is
lost
for
it
is
now
too
late
can
it
be
possible
you
have
not
understood
me
no
my
lord
but
i
pray
you
to
try
and
inform
me
once
more
how
can
i
it
is
now
too
late
and
all
is
over
not
our
will
but
god
be
done
said
fletcher
and
his
lordship
made
another
effort
saying
yes
not
mine
be
done
but
i
will
try
and
he
made
several
attempts
to
speak
but
could
only
repeat
two
or
three
words
at
a
time
such
as
my
wife
my
child
my
sister
you
know
all
you
must
say
all
you
know
my
wishes
the
rest
was
unintelligible
a
consultation
with
three
other
doctors
in
addition
to
the
two
physicians
in
regular
attendance
was
now
held
and
they
appeared
to
think
the
disease
was
changing
from
inflammatory
diathesis
to
languid
and
ordered
stimulants
to
be
administered
dr
bruno
opposed
this
with
the
greatest
warmth
and
pointed
out
that
the
symptoms
were
those
not
of
an
alteration
in
the
disease
but
of
a
fever
flying
to
the
brain
which
was
violently
attacked
by
it
and
that
the
stimulants
they
proposed
would
kill
more
speedily
than
the
disease
itself
while
on
the
other
hand
by
copious
bleeding
and
the
medicines
that
had
been
taken
before
he
might
still
be
saved
the
other
physicians
however
were
of
a
different
opinion
and
then
dr
bruno
declared
he
would
risk
no
farther
responsibility
peruvian
bark
and
wine
were
then
administered
after
taking
these
stimulants
his
lordship
expressed
a
wish
to
sleep
his
last
words
were
i
must
sleep
now
and
he
composed
himself
accordingly
but
never
awoke
again
for
hours
he
continued
in
a
state
of
lethargy
with
the
rattles
occasionally
in
his
throat
at
six
in
the
morning
of
the
fletcher
who
was
watching
by
his
saw
him
open
his
eyes
and
then
shut
them
apparently
without
pain
or
moving
hand
or
foot
my
god
exclaimed
the
faithful
valet
i
fear
his
lordship
is
gone
the
doctors
felt
his
pulse
it
was
so
after
life
fitful
fever
he
sleeps
well
but
the
fittest
dirge
is
his
own
last
lay
written
on
the
day
he
completed
his
year
soon
after
his
arrival
at
missolonghi
when
his
hopes
of
obtaining
distinction
in
the
greek
cause
were
perhaps
brightest
and
yet
it
breathes
of
dejection
almost
to
boding
is
time
this
heart
should
be
unmoved
since
others
it
has
ceased
to
move
yet
though
i
can
not
be
beloved
still
let
me
love
my
days
are
in
the
yellow
leaf
the
flowers
and
fruits
of
love
are
gone
the
worm
the
canker
and
the
grief
are
mine
alone
the
fire
that
in
my
bosom
preys
is
like
to
some
volcanic
isle
no
torch
is
kindled
at
its
blaze
a
funeral
pile
the

chapter
xlviii
the
funeral
preparations
and
final
obsequies
the
death
of
lord
byron
was
felt
by
all
greece
as
a
national
misfortune
from
the
moment
it
was
known
that
fears
were
entertained
for
his
life
the
progress
of
the
disease
was
watched
with
the
deepest
anxiety
and
sorrow
on
easter
sunday
the
day
on
which
he
expired
thousands
of
the
inhabitants
of
missolonghi
had
assembled
on
the
spacious
plain
on
the
outside
of
the
city
according
to
an
ancient
custom
to
exchange
the
salutations
of
the
morning
but
on
this
occasion
it
was
remarked
that
instead
of
the
wonted
congratulations
christ
is
risen
they
inquired
first
how
is
lord
byron
on
the
event
being
made
known
the
provisional
government
assembled
and
a
proclamation
of
which
the
following
is
a
translation
was
issued
provisional
government
of
western
greece
the
day
of
festivity
and
rejoicing
is
turned
into
one
of
sorrow
and
morning
the
lord
noel
byron
departed
this
life
at
eleven
last
night
after
an
illness
of
ten
days
his
death
was
caused
by
an
inflammatory
fever
such
was
the
effect
of
his
lordship
illness
on
the
public
mind
that
all
classes
had
forgotten
their
usual
recreations
of
easter
even
before
the

the
loss
of
this
illustrious
individual
is
undoubtedly
to
be
deplored
by
all

but
it
must
be
more
especially
a
subject
of
lamentation
at
missolonghi
where
his
generosity
has
been
so
conspicuously
displayed
and
of
which
he
had
become
a
citizen

participating
in

dangers
of
the

everybody
is
acquainted
with
the

acts

can
cease
to
hail
his
name
as
that
of
a
real
benefactor

therefore

final

it
was
the
wish
of
lord

others
that
the
interment
should
be
in

but
the
english
opposed
the
proposition
in
the
most
decided
manner

was

suggested

to

solicit
the
remains
for
that
city
but
before
it
arrived
they
were
already
in
zante
and
a

engaged
to
carry
them
to

that
they
would
be

mr

received
it
from

and
by

it
was
removed
to
the

where
it
lay

state
several
days
the
dignitaries
of
the

of

having
as
it
was
said
refused
permission
to
deposit
the
remains
in
either
of

great
national
receptacles
of

illustrious
dead
it
was
determined
that
they
should

laid
in

ancestral
vault
of
the

the
funeral
instead
of
being
public
was
in
consequence
private
and
attended
by
only
a
few
select
friends
to
hucknell
a
small
village
about
two
miles
from
newstead
abbey
in
the
church
of
which
the
vault
is
situated
there
the
coffin
was
deposited
in
conformity
to
a
wish
early
expressed
by
the
poet
that
his
dust
might
be
mingled
with
his
mother
yet
unmeet
and
plain
as
the
solemnity
was
in
its
circumstances
a
remarkable
incident
gave
it
interest
and
distinction
as
it
passed
along
the
streets
of
london
a
sailor
was
observed
walking
uncovered
near
the
hearse
and
on
being
asked
what
he
was
doing
there
replied
that
he
had
served
lord
byron
in
the
levant
and
had
come
to
pay
his
last
respects
to
his
remains
a
simple
but
emphatic
testimony
to
the
sincerity
of
that
regard
which
his
lordship
often
inspired
and
which
with
more
steadiness
might
always
have
commanded
the
coffin
bears
the
following
inscription

chapter

the
character
of
lord
byron
my
endeavour
in
the
foregoing
pages
has
been
to
give
a
general
view
of
the
intellectual
character
of
lord
byron
it
did
not
accord
with
the
plan
to
enter
minutely
into
the
details
of
his
private
life
which
i
suspect
was
not
greatly
different
from
that
of
any
other
person
of
his
rank
not
distinguished
for
particular
severity
of
manners
in
some
respects
his
lordship
was
no
doubt
peculiar
he
possessed
a
vivacity
of
sensibility
not
common
and
talents
of
a
very
extraordinary
kind
he
was
also
distinguished
for
superior
personal
elegance
particularly
in
his
bust
the
style
and
character
of
his
head
were
universally
admired
but
perhaps
the
beauty
of
his
physiognomy
has
been
more
highly
spoken
of
than
it
really
merited
its
chief
grace
consisted
when
he
was
in
a
gay
humour
of
a
liveliness
which
gave
a
joyous
meaning
to
every
articulation
of
the
muscles
and
features
when
he
was
less
agreeably
disposed
the
expression
was
morose
to
a
very
repulsive
degree
it
is
however
unnecessary
to
describe
his
personal
character
here
i
have
already
said
enough
incidentally
to
explain
my
full
opinion
of
it
in
the
mass
i
do
not
think
it
was
calculated
to
attract
much
permanent
affection
or
esteem
in
the
detail
it
was
the
reverse
few
men
possessed
more
companionable
qualities
than
lord
byron
did
occasionally
and
seen
at
intervals
in
those
felicitous
moments
i
imagine
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
have
said
that
a
more
interesting
companion
had
been
previously
met
with
but
he
was
not
always
in
that
fascinating
state
of
pleasantry
he
was
as
often
otherwise
and
no
two
individuals
could
be
more
distinct
from
each
other
than
byron
in
his
gaiety
and
in
his
misanthropy
this
antithesis
was
the
great
cause
of
that
diversity
of
opinion
concerning
him
which
has
so
much
divided
his
friends
and
adversaries
of
his
character
as
a
poet
there
can
be
no
difference
of
opinion
but
only
a
difference
in
the
degree
of
admiration
excellence
in
talent
as
in
every
other
thing
is
comparative
but
the
universal
republic
of
letters
will
acknowledge
that
in
energy
of
expression
and
liveliness
of
imagery
byron
had
no
equal
in
his
own
time
doubts
indeed
may
be
entertained
if
in
these
high
qualities
even
shakspeare
himself
was
his
superior
i
am
not
disposed
to
think
with
many
of
those
who
rank
the
genius
of
byron
almost
as
supreme
that
he
has
shown
less
skill
in
the
construction
of
his
plots
and
the
development
of
his
tales
than
might
have
been
expected
from
one
so
splendidly
endowed
for
it
has
ever
appeared
to
me
that
he
has
accomplished
in
them
everything
he
proposed
to
attain
and
that
in
this
consists
one
of
his
great
merits
his
mind
fervid
and
impassioned
was
in
all
his
compositions
except
don
juan
eagerly
fixed
on
the
catastrophe
he
ever
held
the
goal
full
in
view
and
drove
to
it
in
the
most
immediate
manner
by
this
straightforward
simplicity
all
the
interest
which
intricacy
excites
was
of
necessity
disregarded
he
is
therefore
not
treated
justly
when
it
is
supposed
that
he
might
have
done
better
had
he
shown
more
art
the
wonder
is
that
he
should
have
produced
such
magnificent
effects
with
so
little
he
could
not
have
made
the
satiated
and
meditative
harold
so
darkling
and
excursive
so
lone
aweary
and
misanthropical
had
he
treated
him
as
the
hero
of
a
scholastic
epic
the
might
of
the
poet
in
such
creations
lay
in
the
riches
of
his
diction
and
in
the
felicity
with
which
he
described
feelings
in
relation
to
the
aspect
of
scenes
amid
the
reminiscences
with
which
the
scenes
themselves
were
associated
if
in
language
and
plan
he
be
so
excellent
it
may
be
asked
why
should
he
not
be
honoured
with
that
niche
in
the
temple
which
so
many
in
the
world
have
by
suffrage
assigned
to
him
simply
because
with
all
the
life
and
beauty
of
his
style
the
vigour
and
truth
of
his
descriptions
the
boldness
of
his
conceptions
and
the
reach
of
his
vision
in
the
dark
abysses
of
passion
lord
byron
was
but
imperfectly
acquainted
with
human
nature
he
looked
but
on
the
outside
of
man
no
characteristic
action
distinguishes
one
of
his
heroes
from
another
nor
is
there
much
dissimilarity
in
their
sentiments
they
have
no
individuality
they
stalk
and
pass
in
mist
and
gloom
grim
ghastly
and
portentous
mysterious
shadows
entities
of
the
twilight
weird
things
like
the
sceptred
effigies
of
the
unborn
issue
of
banquo
combined
with
vast
power
lord
byron
possessed
beyond
all
question
the
greatest
degree
of
originality
of
any
poet
of
this
age
in
this
rare
quality
he
has
no
parallel
in
any
age
all
other
poets
and
inventive
authors
are
measured
in
their
excellence
by
the
accuracy
with
which
they
fit
sentiments
appropriate
not
only
to
the
characters
they
create
but
to
the
situations
in
which
they
place
them
the
works
of
lord
byron
display
the
opposite
to
this
and
with
the
most
extraordinary
splendour
he
endows
his
creations
with
his
own
qualities
he
finds
in
the
situations
in
which
he
places
them
only
opportunities
to
express
what
he
has
himself
felt
or
suffered
and
yet
he
mixes
so
much
probability
in
the
circumstances
that
they
are
always
eloquently
proper
he
does
everything
as
it
were
the
reverse
of
other
poets
in
the
air
and
sea
which
have
been
in
all
times
the
emblems
of
change
and
the
similitudes
of
inconstancy
he
has
discovered
the
very
principles
of
permanency
the
ocean
in
his
view
not
by
its
vastness
its
unfathomable
depths
and
its
limitless
extent
becomes
an
image
of
deity
by
its
unchangeable
character
the
variety
of
his
productions
present
a
prodigious
display
of
power
in
his
short
career
he
has
entitled
himself
to
be
ranked
in
the
first
class
of
the
british
poets
for
quantity
alone
by
childe
harold
and
his
other
poems
of
the
same
mood
he
has
extended
the
scope
of
feeling
made
us
acquainted
with
new
trains
of
association
awakened
sympathies
which
few
suspected
themselves
of
possessing
and
he
has
laid
open
darker
recesses
in
the
bosom
than
were
previously
supposed
to
exist
the
deep
and
dreadful
caverns
of
remorse
had
long
been
explored
but
he
was
the
first
to
visit
the
bottomless
pit
of
satiety
the
delineation
of
that
promethean
fortitude
which
defied
conscience
as
he
has
shown
it
in
manfred
is
his
greatest
achievement
the
terrific
fables
of
marlowe
and
of
goethe
in
their
respective
versions
of
the
legend
of
faustus
had
disclosed
the
utmost
writhings
which
remorse
in
the
fiercest
of
its
torments
can
express
but
what
are
those
laocoon
agonies
to
the
sublime
serenity
of
manfred
in
the
power
the
originality
and
the
genius
combined
of
that
unexampled
performance
lord
byron
has
placed
himself
on
an
equality
with
milton
the
satan
of
the
paradise
lost
is
animated
by
motives
and
dignified
by
an
eternal
enterprise
he
hath
purposes
of
infinite
prospect
to
perform
and
an
immeasurable
ambition
to
satisfy
manfred
hath
neither
purpose
nor
ambition
nor
any
desire
that
seeks
gratification
he
hath
done
a
deed
which
severs
him
from
hope
as
everlastingly
as
the
apostacy
with
the
angels
has
done
satan
he
acknowledges
no
contrition
to
bespeak
commiseration
he
complains
of
no
wrong
to
justify
revenge
for
he
feels
none
he
despises
sympathy
and
almost
glories
in
his
perdition
the
creation
of
such
a
character
is
in
the
sublimest
degree
of
originality
to
give
it
appropriate
thoughts
and
feelings
required
powers
worthy
of
the
conception
and
to
make
it
susceptible
of
being
contemplated
as
within
the
scope
and
range
of
human
sympathy
places
byron
above
all
his
contemporaries
and
antecedents
milton
has
described
in
satan
the
greatest
of
human
passions
supernatural
attributes
directed
to
immortal
intents
and
stung
with
inextinguishable
revenge
but
satan
is
only
a
dilatation
of
man
manfred
is
loftier
and
worse
than
satan
he
has
conquered
punishment
having
within
himself
a
greater
than
hell
can
inflict
there
is
a
fearful
mystery
in
this
conception
it
is
only
by
solemnly
questioning
the
spirits
that
lurk
within
the
dark
metaphors
in
which
manfred
expresses
himself
that
the
hideous
secrets
of
the
character
can
be
conjectured
but
although
in
intellectual
power
and
in
creative
originality
byron
is
entitled
to
stand
on
the
highest
peak
of
the
mountain
his
verse
is
often
so
harsh
and
his
language
so
obscure
that
in
the
power
of
delighting
he
is
only
a
poet
of
the
second
class
he
had
all
the
talent
and
the
means
requisite
to
embody
his
conceptions
in
a
manner
worthy
of
their
might
and
majesty
his
treasury
was
rich
in
everything
rare
and
beautiful
for
illustration
but
he
possessed
not
the
instinct
requisite
to
guide
him
in
the
selection
of
the
things
necessary
to
the
inspiration
of
delight
he
could
give
his
statue
life
and
beauty
and
warmth
and
motion
and
eloquence
but
not
a
tuneful
voice
some
curious
metaphysicians
in
their
subtle
criticism
have
said
that
don
juan
was
but
the
bright
side
of
childe
harold
and
that
all
its
most
brilliant
imagery
was
similar
to
that
of
which
the
dark
and
the
shadows
were
delineated
in
his
other
works
it
may
be
so
and
without
question
a
great
similarity
runs
through
everything
that
has
come
from
the
poet
pen
but
it
is
a
family
resemblance
the
progeny
are
all
like
one
another
but
where
are
those
who
are
like
them
i
know
of
no
author
in
prose
or
rhyme
in
the
english
language
with
whom
byron
can
be
compared
imitators
of
his
manner
there
will
be
often
and
many
but
he
will
ever
remain
one
of
the
few
whom
the
world
acknowledges
are
alike
supreme
and
yet
unlike
each
other
epochal
characters
who
mark
extraordinary
periods
in
history
raphael
is
the
only
man
of
whose
career
can
be
compared
with
that
of
byron
at
an
age
when
the
genius
of
most
men
is
but
in
the
dawning
they
had
both
attained
their
meridian
of
glory
and
they
both
died
so
early
that
it
may
be
said
they
were
lent
to
the
world
only
to
show
the
height
to
which
the
mind
may
ascend
when
time
shall
be
allowed
to
accomplish
the
full
cultivations
of
such
extraordinary
endowments
footnotes
against
the
sacrifice
of
antinous
by
the
emperor
adrian
is
supposed
to
have
been
a
sacrifice
of
that
kind
dion
cassius
says
that
adrian
who
had
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
magic
being
deceived
by
the
principles
of
that
black
egyptian
art
into
a
belief
that
he
would
be
rendered
immortal
by
a
voluntary
human
sacrifice
to
the
infernal
gods
accepted
the
offer
which
antinous
made
of
himself
i
have
somewhere
met
with
a
commentary
on
this
to
the
following
effect
the
christian
religion
in
the
time
of
adrian
was
rapidly
spreading
throughout
the
empire
and
the
doctrine
of
gaining
eternal
life
by
the
expiatory
offering
was
openly
preached
the
egyptian
priests
who
pretended
to
be
in
possession
of
all
knowledge
affected
to
be
acquainted
with
this
mystery
also
the
emperor
was
by
his
taste
and
his
vices
attached
to
the
old
religion
but
he
trembled
at
the
truths
disclosed
by
the
revelation
and
in
this
state
of
apprehension
his
thirst
of
knowledge
and
his
fears
led
him
to
consult
the
priests
of
osiris
and
isis
and
they
impressed
him
with
a
notion
that
the
infernal
deities
would
be
appeased
by
the
sacrifice
of
a
human
being
dear
to
him
and
who
loved
him
so
entirely
as
to
lay
down
his
life
for
him

the
anxiety
of
his
imperial
master
when
all
others
had
refused
consented
to
sacrifice
himself
and
it
was
for
this
devotion
that
adrian
caused
his
memory
to
be
hallowed
with
religious
rites
mr
hobhouse
has
assured
me
that
this
information
is
not
correct
i
happen
says
he
to
know
that
lord
byron
offered
to
give
the
guiccioli
a
sum
of
money
outright
or
to
leave
it
to
her
by
his
will
i
also
happen
to
know
that
the
lady
would
not
hear
of
any
such
present
or
provision
for
i
have
a
letter
in
which
lord
byron
extols
her
disinterestedness
and
mentions
that
he
has
met
with
a
similar
refusal
from
another
female
as
to
the
being
in
destitute
circumstances
i
can
not
believe
it
for
count
gamba
her
brother
whom
i
knew
very
well
after
lord
byron
death
never
made
any
complaint
or
mention
of
such
a
fact
add
to
which
i
know
a
maintenance
was
provided
for
her
by
her
husband
in
consequence
of
a
law
process
before
the
death
of
lord
byron
the
calenture
the
swiss
air
the
doctor
evidently
makes
a
mistake
in
confounding
sir
william
hamilton
with
sir
william
