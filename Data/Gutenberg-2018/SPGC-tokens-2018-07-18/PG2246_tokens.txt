notes
in
addition
to
the
notes
below
and
so
you
will
think
all
the
spelling
errors
introduced
by
the
printers
of
the
time
have
been
corrected
here
are
the
first
few
lines
of

as
they
are
presented
herein
barnardo
who
there
fran
nay
answer
me
stand
vnfold
your
selfe
bar
long
liue
the
king
as
i
understand
it
the
printers
often
ran
out
of
certain
words
or
letters
they
had
often
packed
into
a
cliche
is
the
original
meaning
of
the
term
cliche
thus
being
unwilling
to
unpack
the
cliches
and
thus
you
will
see
some
substitutions
that
look
very
odd
as
the
exchanges
of
u
for
v
v
for
u
above
you
may
wonder
why
they
did
it
this
way
presuming
shakespeare
did
not
actually
write
the
play
in
this
manner
the
answer
is
that
they
may
have
packed
liue
into
a
cliche
at
a
time
when
they
were
out
of
v
having
used
vv
in
place
of
some
w
etc
this
was
a
common
practice
of
the
day
as
print
was
still
quite
expensive
and
they
did
want
to
spend
more
on
a
wider
selection
of
characters
than
they
had
to
you
will
find
a
lot
of
these
kinds
of
errors
in
this
text
as
i
have
mentioned
in
other
times
and
places
many
scholars
have
an
extreme
attachment
to
these
errors
and
many
have
accorded
them
a
very
high
place
in
the
canon
of
shakespeare
my
father
read
an
assortment
of
these
made
available
to
him
by
cambridge
university
in
england
for
several
months
in
a
glass
room
constructed
for
the
purpose
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
read
all
those
available
great
detail
determined
from
the
various
changes
that
shakespeare
most
likely
did
not
write
in
nearly
as
many
of
a
variety
of
errors
we
credit
him
for
even
though
he
was
for
signing
his
name
with
several
different
spellings
so
please
take
this
into
account
when
reading
the
comments
below
made
by
our
volunteer
who
prepared
this
file
you
may
see
errors
that
are
not
errors
so
this
caveat
have
not
changed
the
canon
errors
here
is

notes
what
this
is
and
is
this
was
taken
from
a
copy
of
shakespeare
first
folio
and
it
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
in
ascii
to
the
printed
text
the
elongated
s
have
been
changed
to
small
s
and
the
conjoined
ae
have
been
changed
to
ae
i
have
left
the
spelling
punctuation
capitalization
as
close
as
possible
to
the
printed
text
i
have
corrected
some
spelling
mistakes
i
have
put
together
a
spelling
dictionary
devised
from
the
spellings
of
the
geneva
bible
and
shakespeare
first
folio
and
have
unified
spellings
according
to
this
template
typo
and
expanded
abbreviations
as
i
have
come
across
them
everything
within
brackets
is
what
i
have
added
so
if
you
do
like
that
you
can
delete
everything
within
the
brackets
if
you
want
a
purer
shakespeare
another
thing
that
you
should
be
aware
of
is
that
there
are
textual
differences
between
various
copies
of
the
first
folio
so
there
may
be
differences
other
than
what
i
have
mentioned
above
between
this
and
other
first
folio
editions
this
is
due
to
the
habit
of
setting
the
type
and
running
off
a
number
of
copies
and
then
proofing
the
printed
copy
and
correcting
the
type
and
then
continuing
the
printing
run
the
proof
run
was
thrown
away
but
incorporated
into
the
printed
copies
this
is
just
the
way
it
is
the
text
i
have
used
was
a
composite
of
more
than
different
first
folio
editions
best
pages

you

is
against
the
rule
of
nature
to
speake
on

part
of
virginitie
is
to
accuse
your
mothers
which
is
most
infallible
disobedience
he
that
hangs
himselfe

a
virgin
virginitie
murthers
it
selfe

be
buried

deede
where
great
additions
swell

honour
good
alone
is
good
without

vilenesse
is
so
the
propertie
by

not
by
the

shee
is
young
wise
faire
in
these
to
nature
shee
immediate
heire
and
these
breed
honour
that
is
honours
scorne
which
challenges
it

borne

is
not

honours
thriue
when
rather
from

deriue

coherent
euery
night
he
comes
with
musickes
of
all
sorts
and
songs
to
her
vnworthinesse
it
nothing
steeds
vs
to
chide
him
from
our

for
he
persists
as
if
his

lay
hel
why
then
to
night
let
vs
assay
our
plot
which
if
it
speed
is
wicked
meaning
in
a
lawfull
deede
and
lawfull
meaning
in
a
lawfull
act
where
both
not
sinne
and
yet
a
sinfull
fact
but
let
about
it
actus
quartus
enter
one
of
the
frenchmen
with
fiue
or
sixe
other
souldiers
in
ambush
lord
he
can
come
no
other
way
but
by
this
hedge
corner
when
you
sallie
vpon
him
speake
what
terrible
language
you
will
though
you
vnderstand
it
not
your
selues
no
matter
for
we
must
not
seeme
to
vnderstand
him
vnlesse
some
one
among
vs
whom
wee
must
produce
for
an
interpreter
good
captaine
let
me
be
th
interpreter
art
not
acquainted
with
him
knowes
he
not
thy
voice
no
sir
i
warrant
you
but
what
linsie
wolsy
hast
thou
to
speake
to
vs
againe
such
as
you
speake
to
me
he
must
thinke
vs
some
band
of
strangers
aduersaries
entertainment
now
he
hath
a
smacke
of
all
neighbouring
languages
therefore
we
must
euery
one
be
a
man
of
his
owne
fancie
not
to
know
what
we
speak
one
to
another
so
we
seeme
to
know
is
to
know
straight
our
purpose
choughs
language
gabble
enough
and
good
enough
as
for
you
interpreter
you
must
seeme
very
politicke
but
couch
hoa
heere
hee
comes
to
beguile
two
houres
in
a
sleepe
and
then
to
returne
swear
the
lies
he
forges
enter
parrolles
par
ten
a
clocke
within
these
three
houres
be
time
enough
to
goe
home
what
shall
i
say
i
haue
done
it
must
bee
a
very
plausiue
inuention
that
carries
it
they
beginne
to
smoake
mee
and
disgraces
haue
of
late
knock
too
often
at
my
doore
i
finde
my
tongue
is
too
but
my
heart
hath
the
feare
of
mars
before
it
and
of
his
creatures
not
daring
the
reports
of
my
tongue
this
is
the
first
truth
that
ere
thine
own
tongue
was
guiltie
of
par
what
the
diuell
should
moue
mee
to
vndertake
the
recouerie
of
this
drumme
being
not
ignorant
of
the
impossibility
and
knowing
i
had
no
such
purpose
i
must
giue
my

lasciuious

who
is
a
whale
to
virginity
and
deuours
vp
all
the

it
finds
ber
damnable

paralels
nessus
hee
professes
not
keeping
of

em
he
is
stronger
then
hercules
he
will
lye
sir
with
such
volubilitie
that
you
would
thinke
truth
were
a
foole
drunkennesse
is
his
best
vertue
for
he
will
be
and
in
his
sleepe
he
does
little
harme
saue
to
his
about
him
but
they
know
his
conditions
and
lay
him
in
straw
i
haue
but
little
more
to
say
sir
of
his
honesty
he
ha
euerie
thing
that
an
honest
man
should
not
haue
what
an
honest
man
should
haue
he
has
nothing
i
begin

loue
him
for
this
ber
for
this
description
of
thine
honestie
a
pox
vpon
him
for
me
he
more
and
more
a

say
you
to
his
expertnesse
in
warre
par
faith
sir
ha
led
the
drumme
before
the
english
tragedians
to
belye
him
i
will
not
and
more
of
his
souldiership
i
know
not
except
in
that
country
he
had
the
honour
to
be
the
officer
at
a
place
there
called
to
instruct
for
the
doubling
of
files
i
would
doe
the
man
what
honour
i
can
but
of
this
i
am
not
certaine
he
hath
villanie
so
farre
that
the
raritie
redeemes
him
ber
a
pox
on
him
he
a
cat
still
int
his
qualities
being
at
this
poore
price
i
neede
not
to
aske
you
if
gold
will
corrupt
him
to
reuolt
par
sir
for
a
cardceue
he
will
sell
the
of
his
saluation
the
inheritance
of
it
and
cut
th

a
perpetuall
