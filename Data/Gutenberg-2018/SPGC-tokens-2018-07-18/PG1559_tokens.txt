centered
on
lucien
s
parisian
life

and
david
reverts
to
the
setting
of
angouleme
in
many
references
parts
one
and
three
are
combined
under
the
title
lost
illusions
and
a
distinguished
provincial
at
paris
is
given
its
individual
title
following
this
trilogy
lucien
s
story
is
continued
in
another
book
scenes
from
a
courtesan
s
life
a
distinguished
provincial
at
paris
part
i
mme
de
bargeton
and
lucien
de
rubempre
had
left
angouleme
behind
and
were
traveling
together
upon
the
road
to
paris
not
one
of
the
party
who
made
that
journey
alluded
to
it
afterwards
but
it
may
be
believed
that
an
infatuated
youth
who
had
looked
forward
to
the
delights
of
an
elopement
must
have
found
the
continual
presence
of
gentil
the
and
albertine
the
maid
not
a
little
irksome
on
the
way
lucien
traveling
post
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
was
horrified
to
see
pretty
nearly
the
whole
sum
on
which
he
meant
to
live
in
paris
for
a
twelvemonth
dropped
along
the
road
like
other
men
who
combine
great
intellectual
powers
with
the
charming
simplicity
of
childhood
he
openly
expressed
his
surprise
at
the
new
and
wonderful
things
which
he
saw
and
thereby
made
a
mistake
a
man
should
study
a
woman
very
carefully
before
he
allows
her
to
see
his
thoughts
and
emotions
as
they
arise
in
him
a
woman
whose
nature
is
large
as
her
heart
is
tender
can
smile
upon
childishness
and
make
allowances
but
let
her
have
ever
so
small
a
spice
of
vanity
herself
and
she
can
not
forgive
childishness
or
littleness
or
vanity
in
her
lover
many
a
woman
is
so
extravagant
a
worshiper
that
she
must
always
see
the
god
in
her
idol
but
there
are
yet
others
who
love
a
man
for
his
sake
and
not
for
their
own
and
adore
his
failings
with
his
greater
qualities
lucien
had
not
guessed
as
yet
that
mme
de
bargeton
s
love
was
grafted
on
pride
he
made
another
mistake
when
he
failed
to
discern
the
meaning
of
certain
smiles
which
flitted
over
louise
s
lips
from
time
to
time
and
instead
of
keeping
himself
to
himself
he
indulged
in
the
playfulness
of
the
young
rat
emerging
from
his
hole
for
the
first
time
the
travelers
were
set
down
before
daybreak
at
the
sign
of
the
in
the
rue
de
l
echelle
both
so
tired
out
with
the
journey
that
louise
went
straight
to
bed
and
slept
first
bidding
lucien
to
engage
the
room
immediately
overhead
lucien
slept
on
till
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
when
he
was
awakened
by
mme
de
bargeton
s
servant
and
learning
the
hour
made
a
hasty
toilet
and
hurried
downstairs
louise
was
sitting
in
the
shabby
inn
hotel
accommodation
is
a
blot
on
the
civilization
of
paris
for
with
all
its
pretensions
to
elegance
the
city
as
yet
does
not
boast
a
single
inn
where
a
traveler
can
find
the
surroundings
to
which
he
is
accustomed
at
home
to
lucien
s
eyes
louise
was
hardly
recognizable
in
this
cheerless
sunless
room
with
the
shabby
the
comfortless
polished
floor
the
hideous
furniture
bought
or
much
the
worse
for
wear
some
people
no
longer
look
the
same
when
detached
from
the
background
of
faces
objects
and
surroundings
which
serve
as
a
setting
without
which
indeed
they
seem
to
lose
something
of
their
intrinsic
worth
personality
demands
its
appropriate
atmosphere
to
bring
out
its
values
just
as
the
figures
in
flemish
interiors
need
the
arrangement
of
light
and
shade
in
which
they
are
placed
by
the
painter
s
genius
if
they
are
to
live
for
us
this
is
especially
true
of
provincials
mme
de
bargeton
moreover
looked
more
thoughtful
and
dignified
than
was
necessary
now
when
no
barriers
stood
between
her
and
happiness
gentil
and
albertine
waited
upon
them
and
while
they
were
present
lucien
could
not
complain
the
dinner
sent
in
from
a
neighboring
restaurant
fell
far
below
the
provincial
average
both
in
quantity
and
quality
the
essential
goodness
of
country
fare
was
wanting
and
in
point
of
quantity
the
portions
were
cut
with
so
strict
an
eye
to
business
that
they
savored
of
short
commons
in
such
small
matters
paris
does
not
show
its
best
side
to
travelers
of
moderate
fortune
lucien
waited
till
the
meal
was
over
some
change
had
come
over
louise
he
thought
but
he
could
not
explain
it
and
a
change
had
in
fact
taken
place
events
had
occurred
while
he
slept
for
reflection
is
an
event
in
our
inner
history
and
mme
de
bargeton
had
been
reflecting
about
two
o
clock
that
afternoon
sixte
du
chatelet
made
his
appearance
in
the
rue
de
l
echelle
and
asked
for
albertine
the
sleeping
damsel
was
roused
and
to
her
he
expressed
his
wish
to
speak
with
her
mistress
mme
de
bargeton
had
scarcely
time
to
dress
before
he
came
back
again
the
unaccountable
apparition
of
du
chatelet
roused
the
lady
s
curiosity
for
she
had
kept
her
journey
a
profound
secret
as
she
thought
at
three
o
clock
the
visitor
was
admitted
i
have
risked
a
reprimand
from
headquarters
to
follow
you
he
said
as
he
greeted
her
i
foresaw
coming
events
but
if
i
lose
my
post
for
it
you
at
any
rate
shall
not
be
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
mme
de
bargeton
i
can
see
plainly
that
you
love
lucien
he
continued
with
an
air
of
tender
resignation
you
must
love
indeed
if
can
act
thus
recklessly
and
disregard
the
conventions
which
you
know
so
well
dear
adored
nais
can
you
really
imagine
that
mme
d
espard
s
salon
or
any
other
salon
in
paris
will
not
be
closed
to
you
as
soon
as
it
is
known
that
you
have
fled
from
angouleme
as
it
were
with
a
young
man
especially
after
the
duel
between
de
bargeton
and
de
chandour
the
fact
that
your
husband
has
gone
to
the
escarbas
looks
like
a
separation
under
such
circumstances
a
gentleman
fights
first
and
afterwards
leaves
his
wife
at
liberty
by
all
means
give
de
rubempre
your
love
and
your
countenance
do
just
as
you
please
but
you
must
not
live
in
the
same
house
if
anybody
here
in
paris
knew
that
you
had
traveled
together
the
whole
world
that
you
have
a
mind
to
see
would
point
the
finger
at
you
and
nais
do
not
make
these
sacrifices
for
a
young
man
whom
you
have
as
yet
compared
with
no
one
else
he
on
his
side
has
been
put
to
no
proof
he
may
forsake
you
for
some
parisienne
better
able
as
he
may
fancy
to
further
his
ambitions
i
mean
no
harm
to
the
man
you
love
but
you
will
permit
me
to
put
your
own
interests
before
his
and
to
beg
you
to
study
him
to
be
fully
aware
of
the
serious
nature
of
this
step
that
you
are
taking
and
then
if
you
find
all
doors
closed
against
you
and
that
none
of
the
women
call
upon
you
make
sure
at
least
that
you
will
feel
no
regret
for
all
that
you
have
renounced
for
him
be
very
certain
first
that
he
for
whom
you
will
have
given
up
so
much
will
always
be
worthy
of
your
sacrifices
and
appreciate
them
just
now
continued
chatelet
mme
d
espard
is
the
more
prudish
and
particular
because
she
herself
is
separated
from
her
husband
nobody
knows
why
the
navarreins
the
lenoncourts
the
and
the
rest
of
the
relations
have
all
rallied
round
her
the
most
women
are
seen
at
her
house
and
receive
her
with
respect
and
the
marquis
d
espard
has
been
put
in
the
wrong
the
first
call
that
you
pay
will
make
it
clear
to
you
that
i
am
right
indeed
knowing
paris
as
i
do
i
can
tell
you
beforehand
that
you
will
no
sooner
enter
the
marquise
s
salon
than
you
will
be
in
despair
lest
she
should
find
out
that
you
are
staying
at
the
with
an
apothecary
s
son
though
he
may
wish
to
be
called
de
rubempre
you
will
have
rivals
here
women
far
more
astute
and
shrewd
than
amelie
they
will
not
fail
to
discover
who
you
are
where
you
are
where
you
come
from
and
all
that
you
are
doing
you
have
counted
upon
your
incognito
i
see
but
you
are
one
of
those
women
for
whom
an
incognito
is
out
of
the
question
you
will
meet
angouleme
at
every
turn
there
are
the
deputies
from
the
charente
coming
up
for
the
opening
of
the
session
there
is
the
commandant
in
paris
on
leave
why
the
first
man
or
woman
from
angouleme
who
happens
to
see
you
would
cut
your
career
short
in
a
strange
fashion
you
would
simply
be
lucien
s
mistress
if
you
need
me
at
any
time
i
am
staying
with
the
in
the
rue
du
faubourg
two
steps
away
from
mme
d
espard
s
i
am
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
marechale
de
carigliano
mme
de
serizy
and
the
president
of
the
council
to
introduce
you
to
those
houses
but
you
will
meet
so
many
people
at
mme
d
espard
s
that
you
are
not
likely
to
require
me
so
far
from
wishing
to
gain
admittance
to
this
set
or
that
every
one
will
be
longing
to
make
your
chatelet
talked
on
mme
de
bargeton
made
no
interruption
she
was
struck
with
his
perspicacity
the
queen
of
angouleme
had
in
fact
counted
upon
preserving
her
incognito
you
are
right
my
dear
friend
she
said
at
length
but
what
am
i
to
do
allow
me
to
find
suitable
furnished
lodgings
for
you
suggested
chatelet
that
way
of
living
is
less
expensive
than
an
inn
you
will
have
a
home
of
your
own
and
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
sleep
in
your
new
rooms
this
very
but
how
did
you
know
my
address
queried
she
your
traveling
carriage
is
easily
recognized
and
besides
i
was
following
you
at
sevres
your
postilion
told
mine
that
he
had
brought
you
here
will
you
permit
me
to
act
as
your
harbinger
i
will
write
as
soon
as
i
have
found
very
well
do
so
said
she
and
in
those
seemingly
insignificant
words
all
was
said
the
baron
du
chatelet
had
spoken
the
language
of
worldly
wisdom
to
a
woman
of
the
world
he
had
made
his
appearance
before
her
in
faultless
dress
a
neat
cab
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
and
mme
de
bargeton
standing
by
the
window
thinking
over
the
position
chanced
to
see
the
elderly
dandy
drive
away
a
few
moments
later
lucien
appeared
half
awake
and
hastily
dressed
he
was
handsome
it
is
true
but
his
clothes
his
last
year
s
nankeen
trousers
and
his
shabby
tight
jacket
were
ridiculous
put
antinous
or
the
apollo
belvedere
himself
into
a
s
blouse
and
how
shall
you
recognize
the
godlike
creature
of
the
greek
or
roman
chisel
the
eyes
note
and
compare
before
the
heart
has
time
to
revise
the
swift
involuntary
judgment
and
the
contrast
between
lucien
and
chatelet
was
so
abrupt
that
it
could
not
fail
to
strike
louise
towards
six
o
clock
that
evening
when
dinner
was
over
mme
de
bargeton
beckoned
lucien
to
sit
beside
her
on
the
shabby
sofa
covered
with
a
flowered
chintz
a
yellow
pattern
on
a
red
ground
lucien
mine
she
said
don
t
you
think
that
if
we
have
both
of
us
done
a
foolish
thing
suicidal
for
both
our
interests
it
would
only
be
common
sense
to
set
matters
right
we
ought
not
to
live
together
in
paris
dear
boy
and
we
must
not
allow
anyone
to
suspect
that
we
traveled
together
your
career
depends
so
much
upon
my
position
that
i
ought
to
do
nothing
to
spoil
it
so
i
am
going
to
remove
into
lodgings
near
by
but
you
will
stay
on
here
we
can
see
each
other
every
day
and
nobody
can
say
a
word
against
and
louise
explained
conventions
to
lucien
who
opened
wide
eyes
he
had
still
to
learn
that
when
a
woman
thinks
better
of
her
folly
she
thinks
better
of
her
love
but
one
thing
he
understood
he
saw
that
he
was
no
longer
the
lucien
of
angouleme
louise
talked
of
herself
of
interests
reputation
and
of
the
world
and
to
veil
her
egoism
she
tried
to
make
him
believe
that
this
was
all
on
his
account
he
had
no
claim
upon
louise
thus
suddenly
transformed
into
mme
de
bargeton
and
more
serious
still
he
had
no
power
over
her
he
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
that
filled
his
eyes
if
i
am
your
glory
cried
the
poet
you
are
yet
more
to
me
you
are
my
one
hope
my
whole
future
rests
with
you
i
thought
that
if
you
meant
to
make
my
successes
yours
you
would
surely
make
my
adversity
yours
also
and
here
we
are
going
to
part
you
are
judging
my
conduct
said
she
you
do
not
love
lucien
looked
at
her
with
such
a
dolorous
expression
that
in
spite
of
herself
she
said
darling
i
will
stay
if
you
like
we
shall
both
be
ruined
we
shall
have
no
one
to
come
to
our
aid
but
when
we
are
both
equally
wretched
and
every
one
shuts
their
door
upon
us
both
when
failure
for
we
must
look
all
possibilities
in
the
face
when
failure
drives
us
back
to
the
escarbas
then
remember
love
that
i
foresaw
the
end
and
that
at
the
first
i
proposed
that
we
should
make
your
way
by
conforming
to
established
louise
he
cried
with
his
arms
around
her
you
are
wise
you
frighten
me
remember
that
i
am
a
child
that
i
have
given
myself
up
entirely
to
your
dear
will
i
myself
should
have
preferred
to
overcome
obstacles
and
win
my
way
among
men
by
the
power
that
is
in
me
but
if
i
can
reach
the
goal
sooner
through
your
aid
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
owe
all
my
success
to
you
forgive
me
you
mean
so
much
to
me
that
i
can
not
help
fearing
all
kinds
of
things
and
for
me
parting
means
that
desertion
is
at
hand
and
desertion
is
but
my
dear
boy
the
world
s
demands
are
soon
satisfied
returned
she
you
must
sleep
here
that
is
all
all
day
long
you
will
be
with
me
and
no
one
can
say
a
a
few
kisses
set
lucien
s
mind
completely
at
rest
an
hour
later
gentil
brought
in
a
note
from
chatelet
he
told
mme
de
bargeton
that
he
had
found
lodgings
for
her
in
the
rue
mme
de
bargeton
informed
herself
of
the
exact
place
and
found
that
it
was
not
very
far
from
the
rue
de
l
echelle
we
shall
be
neighbors
she
told
lucien
two
hours
afterwards
louise
stepped
into
the
hired
carriage
sent
by
chatelet
for
the
removal
to
the
new
rooms
the
apartments
were
of
the
class
that
upholsterers
furnish
and
let
to
wealthy
deputies
and
persons
of
consideration
on
a
short
visit
to
paris
showy
and
uncomfortable
it
was
eleven
o
clock
when
lucien
returned
to
his
inn
having
seen
nothing
as
yet
of
paris
except
the
part
of
the
rue
which
lies
between
the
rue
and
the
rue
de
l
echelle
he
lay
down
in
his
miserable
little
room
and
could
not
help
comparing
it
in
his
own
mind
with
louise
s
sumptuous
apartments
just
as
he
came
away
the
baron
du
chatelet
came
in
gorgeously
arrayed
in
evening
dress
fresh
from
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
to
inquire
whether
mme
de
bargeton
was
satisfied
with
all
that
he
had
done
on
her
behalf
nais
was
uneasy
the
splendor
was
alarming
to
her
mind
provincial
life
had
reacted
upon
her
she
was
painfully
conscientious
over
her
accounts
and
economical
to
a
degree
that
is
looked
upon
as
miserly
in
paris
she
had
brought
with
her
twenty
thousand
francs
in
the
shape
of
a
draft
on
the
considering
that
the
sum
would
more
than
cover
the
expenses
of
four
years
in
paris
she
was
afraid
already
lest
she
should
not
have
enough
and
should
run
into
debt
and
now
chatelet
told
her
that
her
rooms
would
only
cost
six
hundred
francs
per
month
a
mere
trifle
added
he
seeing
that
nais
was
startled
for
five
hundred
francs
a
month
you
can
have
a
carriage
from
a
livery
stable
fifty
louis
in
all
you
need
only
think
of
your
dress
a
woman
moving
in
good
society
could
not
well
do
less
and
if
you
mean
to
obtain
a
s
appointment
for
de
bargeton
or
a
post
in
the
household
you
ought
not
to
look
here
in
paris
they
only
give
to
the
rich
it
is
most
fortunate
that
you
brought
gentil
to
go
out
with
you
and
albertine
for
your
own
woman
for
servants
are
enough
to
ruin
you
here
but
with
your
introductions
you
will
seldom
be
home
to
a
mme
de
bargeton
and
the
baron
de
chatelet
chatted
about
paris
chatelet
gave
her
all
the
news
of
the
day
the
myriad
nothings
that
you
are
bound
to
know
under
penalty
of
being
a
nobody
before
very
long
the
baron
also
gave
advice
as
to
shopping
recommending
herbault
for
toques
and
juliette
for
hats
and
bonnets
he
added
the
address
of
a
fashionable
dressmaker
to
supersede
victorine
in
short
he
made
the
lady
see
the
necessity
of
rubbing
off
angouleme
then
he
took
his
leave
after
a
final
flash
of
happy
inspiration
i
expect
i
shall
have
a
box
at
one
of
the
theatres
he
remarked
carelessly
i
will
call
for
you
and
de
rubempre
for
you
must
allow
me
to
do
the
honors
of
there
is
more
generosity
in
his
character
than
i
thought
said
mme
de
bargeton
to
herself
when
lucien
was
included
in
the
invitation
in
the
month
of
june
ministers
are
often
puzzled
to
know
what
to
do
with
boxes
at
the
theatre
ministerialist
deputies
and
their
constituents
are
busy
in
their
vineyards
or
harvest
fields
and
their
more
exacting
acquaintances
are
in
the
country
or
traveling
about
so
it
comes
to
pass
that
the
best
seats
are
filled
at
this
season
with
heterogeneous
never
seen
at
any
other
time
of
year
and
the
house
is
apt
to
look
as
if
it
were
tapestried
with
very
shabby
material
chatelet
had
thought
already
that
this
was
his
opportunity
of
giving
nais
the
amusements
which
provincials
crave
most
eagerly
and
that
with
very
little
expense
the
next
morning
the
very
first
morning
in
paris
lucien
went
to
the
rue
and
found
that
louise
had
gone
out
she
had
gone
to
make
some
indispensable
purchases
to
take
counsel
of
the
mighty
and
illustrious
authorities
in
the
matter
of
the
feminine
toilette
pointed
out
to
her
by
chatelet
for
she
had
written
to
tell
the
marquise
d
espard
of
her
arrival
mme
de
bargeton
possessed
the
born
of
a
long
habit
of
rule
but
she
was
exceedingly
afraid
of
appearing
to
be
provincial
she
had
tact
enough
to
know
how
greatly
the
relations
of
women
among
themselves
depend
upon
first
impressions
and
though
she
felt
that
she
was
equal
to
taking
her
place
at
once
in
such
a
distinguished
set
as
mme
de
d
espard
s
she
felt
also
that
she
stood
in
need
of
goodwill
at
her
first
entrance
into
society
and
was
resolved
in
the
first
place
that
she
would
leave
nothing
undone
to
secure
success
so
she
felt
boundlessly
thankful
to
chatelet
for
pointing
out
these
ways
of
putting
herself
in
harmony
with
the
fashionable
world
a
singular
chance
so
ordered
it
that
the
marquise
was
delighted
to
find
an
opportunity
of
being
useful
to
a
connection
of
her
husband
s
family
the
marquis
d
espard
had
withdrawn
himself
without
apparent
reason
from
society
and
ceased
to
take
any
active
interest
in
affairs
political
or
domestic
his
wife
thus
left
mistress
of
her
actions
felt
the
need
of
the
support
of
public
opinion
and
was
glad
to
take
the
marquis
place
and
give
her
countenance
to
one
of
her
husband
s
relations
she
meant
to
be
ostentatiously
gracious
so
as
to
put
her
husband
more
evidently
in
the
wrong
and
that
very
day
she
wrote
mme
de
bargeton
negrepelisse
a
charming
billet
one
of
the
prettily
worded
compositions
of
which
time
alone
can
discover
the
emptiness
she
was
delighted
that
circumstances
had
brought
a
relative
of
whom
she
had
heard
whose
acquaintance
she
had
desired
to
make
into
closer
connection
with
her
family
friendships
in
paris
were
not
so
solid
but
that
she
longed
to
find
one
more
to
love
on
earth
and
if
this
might
not
be
there
would
only
be
one
more
illusion
to
bury
with
the
rest
she
put
herself
entirely
at
her
cousin
s
disposal
she
would
have
called
upon
her
if
indisposition
had
not
kept
her
to
the
house
and
she
felt
that
she
lay
already
under
obligations
to
the
cousin
who
had
thought
of
lucien
meanwhile
taking
his
first
ramble
along
the
rue
de
la
paix
and
through
the
boulevards
like
all
newcomers
was
much
more
interested
in
the
things
that
he
saw
than
in
the
people
he
met
the
general
effect
of
paris
is
wholly
engrossing
at
first
the
wealth
in
the
shop
windows
the
high
houses
the
streams
of
traffic
the
contrast
everywhere
between
the
last
extremes
of
luxury
and
want
struck
him
more
than
anything
else
in
his
astonishment
at
the
crowds
of
strange
faces
the
man
of
imaginative
temper
felt
as
if
he
himself
had
shrunk
as
it
were
immensely
a
man
of
any
consequence
in
his
native
place
where
he
can
not
go
out
but
he
meets
with
some
recognition
of
his
importance
at
every
step
does
not
readily
accustom
himself
to
the
sudden
and
total
extinction
of
his
consequence
you
are
somebody
in
your
own
country
in
paris
you
are
nobody
the
transition
between
the
first
state
and
the
last
should
be
made
gradually
for
the
too
abrupt
fall
is
something
like
annihilation
paris
could
not
fail
to
be
an
appalling
wilderness
for
a
young
poet
who
looked
for
an
echo
for
all
his
sentiments
a
confidant
for
all
his
thoughts
a
soul
to
share
his
least
sensations
lucien
had
not
gone
in
search
of
his
luggage
and
his
best
blue
coat
and
painfully
conscious
of
the
shabbiness
to
say
no
worse
of
his
clothes
he
went
to
mme
de
bargeton
feeling
that
she
must
have
returned
he
found
the
baron
du
chatelet
who
carried
them
both
off
to
dinner
at
the
de
lucien
s
head
was
dizzy
with
the
whirl
of
paris
the
baron
was
in
the
carriage
he
could
say
nothing
to
louise
but
he
squeezed
her
hand
and
she
gave
a
warm
response
to
the
mute
confidence
after
dinner
chatelet
took
his
guests
to
the
vaudeville
lucien
in
his
heart
was
not
over
well
pleased
to
see
chatelet
again
and
cursed
the
chance
that
had
brought
the
baron
to
paris
the
baron
said
that
ambition
had
brought
him
to
town
he
had
hopes
of
an
appointment
as
to
a
government
department
and
meant
to
take
a
seat
in
the
council
of
state
as
master
of
requests
he
had
come
to
paris
to
ask
for
fulfilment
of
the
promises
that
had
been
given
him
for
a
man
of
his
stamp
could
not
be
expected
to
remain
a
comptroller
all
his
life
he
would
rather
be
nothing
at
all
and
offer
himself
for
election
as
deputy
or
diplomacy
chatelet
grew
visibly
taller
lucien
dimly
began
to
recognize
in
this
elderly
beau
the
superiority
of
the
man
of
the
world
who
knows
paris
and
most
of
all
he
felt
ashamed
to
owe
his
evening
s
amusement
to
his
rival
and
while
the
poet
looked
ill
at
ease
and
awkward
her
royal
highness
was
quite
in
his
element
he
smiled
at
his
rival
s
hesitations
at
his
astonishment
at
the
questions
he
put
at
the
little
mistakes
which
the
latter
ignorantly
made
much
as
an
old
salt
laughs
at
an
apprentice
who
has
not
found
his
sea
legs
but
lucien
s
pleasure
at
seeing
a
play
for
the
first
time
in
paris
outweighed
the
annoyance
of
these
small
humiliations
that
evening
marked
an
epoch
in
lucien
s
career
he
put
away
a
good
many
of
his
ideas
as
to
provincial
life
in
the
course
of
it
his
horizon
widened
society
assumed
different
proportions
there
were
fair
parisiennes
in
fresh
and
elegant
toilettes
all
about
him
mme
de
bargeton
s
costume
tolerably
ambitious
though
it
was
looked
dowdy
by
comparison
the
material
like
the
fashion
and
the
color
was
out
of
date
that
way
of
arranging
her
hair
so
bewitching
in
angouleme
looked
frightfully
ugly
here
among
the
daintily
devised
coiffures
which
he
saw
in
every
direction
will
she
always
look
like
that
said
he
to
himself
ignorant
that
the
morning
had
been
spent
in
preparing
a
transformation
in
the
provinces
comparison
and
choice
are
out
of
the
question
when
a
face
has
grown
familiar
it
comes
to
possess
a
certain
beauty
that
is
taken
for
granted
but
transport
the
pretty
woman
of
the
provinces
to
paris
and
no
one
takes
the
slightest
notice
of
her
her
prettiness
is
of
the
comparative
degree
illustrated
by
the
saying
that
among
the
blind
the
are
kings
lucien
s
eyes
were
now
busy
comparing
mme
de
bargeton
with
other
women
just
as
she
herself
had
contrasted
him
with
chatelet
on
the
previous
day
and
mme
de
bargeton
on
her
part
permitted
herself
some
strange
reflections
upon
her
lover
the
poet
cut
a
poor
figure
notwithstanding
his
singular
beauty
the
sleeves
of
his
jacket
were
too
short
with
his
country
gloves
and
a
waistcoat
too
scanty
for
him
he
looked
prodigiously
ridiculous
compared
with
the
young
men
in
the
balcony
positively
pitiable
thought
mme
de
bargeton
chatelet
interested
in
her
without
presumption
taking
care
of
her
in
a
manner
that
revealed
a
profound
passion
chatelet
elegant
and
as
much
at
home
as
an
actor
treading
the
familiar
boards
of
his
theatre
in
two
days
had
recovered
all
the
ground
lost
in
the
past
six
months
ordinary
people
will
not
admit
that
our
sentiments
towards
each
other
can
totally
change
in
a
moment
and
yet
certain
it
is
that
two
lovers
not
seldom
fly
apart
even
more
quickly
than
they
drew
together
in
mme
de
bargeton
and
in
lucien
a
process
of
disenchantment
was
at
work
paris
was
the
cause
life
had
widened
out
before
the
poet
s
eyes
as
society
came
to
wear
a
new
aspect
for
louise
nothing
but
an
accident
now
was
needed
to
sever
finally
the
bond
that
united
them
nor
was
that
blow
so
terrible
for
lucien
very
long
delayed
mme
de
bargeton
set
lucien
down
at
his
inn
and
drove
home
with
chatelet
to
the
intense
vexation
of
the
luckless
lover
what
will
they
say
about
me
he
wondered
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
to
his
dismal
room
that
poor
fellow
is
uncommonly
dull
said
chatelet
with
a
smile
when
the
door
was
closed
that
is
the
way
with
those
who
have
a
world
of
thoughts
in
their
heart
and
brain
men
who
have
so
much
in
them
to
give
out
in
great
works
long
dreamed
of
profess
a
certain
contempt
for
conversation
a
commerce
in
which
the
intellect
spends
itself
in
small
change
returned
the
haughty
negrepelisse
she
still
had
courage
to
defend
lucien
but
less
for
lucien
s
sake
than
for
her
own
i
grant
it
you
willingly
replied
the
baron
but
we
live
with
human
beings
and
not
with
books
there
dear
nais
i
see
how
it
is
there
is
nothing
between
you
yet
and
i
am
delighted
that
it
is
so
if
you
decide
to
bring
an
interest
of
a
kind
hitherto
lacking
into
your
life
let
it
not
be
this
genius
i
implore
you
how
if
you
have
made
a
mistake
suppose
that
in
a
few
days
time
when
you
have
compared
him
with
men
whom
you
will
meet
men
of
real
ability
men
who
have
distinguished
themselves
in
good
earnest
suppose
that
you
should
discover
dear
and
fair
siren
that
it
is
no
that
you
have
borne
into
port
on
your
dazzling
shoulders
but
a
little
ape
with
no
manners
and
no
capacity
a
presumptuous
fool
who
may
be
a
wit
in
l
houmeau
but
turns
out
a
very
ordinary
specimen
of
a
young
man
in
paris
and
after
all
volumes
of
verse
come
out
every
week
here
the
worst
of
them
better
than
all
chardon
s
poetry
put
together
for
pity
s
sake
wait
and
compare
friday
is
opera
night
he
continued
as
the
carriage
turned
into
the
rue
mme
d
espard
has
the
box
of
the
first
gentlemen
of
the
chamber
and
will
take
you
no
doubt
i
shall
go
to
mme
de
serizy
s
box
to
behold
you
in
your
glory
they
are
giving
said
she
next
morning
mme
de
bargeton
tried
to
arrange
a
suitable
toilette
in
which
to
call
on
her
cousin
mme
d
espard
the
weather
was
rather
chilly
looking
through
the
dowdy
wardrobe
from
angouleme
she
found
nothing
better
than
a
certain
green
velvet
gown
trimmed
fantastically
enough
lucien
for
his
part
felt
that
he
must
go
at
once
for
his
celebrated
blue
best
coat
he
felt
aghast
at
the
thought
of
his
tight
jacket
and
determined
to
be
well
dressed
lest
he
should
meet
the
marquise
d
espard
or
receive
a
sudden
summons
to
her
house
he
must
have
his
luggage
at
once
so
he
took
a
cab
and
in
two
hours
time
spent
three
or
four
francs
matter
for
much
subsequent
reflection
on
the
scale
of
the
cost
of
living
in
paris
having
dressed
himself
in
his
best
such
as
it
was
he
went
to
the
rue
and
on
the
doorstep
encountered
gentil
in
company
with
a
gorgeously
chasseur
i
was
just
going
round
to
you
sir
madame
gave
me
a
line
for
you
said
gentil
ignorant
of
parisian
forms
of
respect
and
accustomed
to
homely
provincial
ways
the
chasseur
took
the
poet
for
a
servant
lucien
tore
open
the
note
and
learned
that
mme
de
bargeton
had
gone
to
spend
the
day
with
the
marquise
d
espard
she
was
going
to
the
opera
in
the
evening
but
she
told
lucien
to
be
there
to
meet
her
her
cousin
permitted
her
to
give
him
a
seat
in
her
box
the
marquise
d
espard
was
delighted
to
procure
the
young
poet
that
pleasure
then
she
loves
me
my
fears
were
all
nonsense
said
lucien
to
himself
she
is
going
to
present
me
to
her
cousin
this
very
he
jumped
for
joy
he
would
spend
the
day
that
separated
him
from
the
happy
evening
as
joyously
as
might
be
he
dashed
out
in
the
direction
of
the
tuileries
dreaming
of
walking
there
until
it
was
time
to
dine
at
very
s
and
now
behold
lucien
frisking
and
skipping
light
of
foot
because
light
of
heart
on
his
way
to
the
terrasse
des
feuillants
to
take
a
look
at
the
people
of
quality
on
promenade
there
pretty
women
walk
with
men
of
fashion
their
adorers
couples
greet
each
other
with
a
glance
as
they
pass
how
different
it
is
from
the
terrace
at
beaulieu
how
far
finer
the
birds
on
this
perch
than
the
angouleme
species
it
is
as
if
you
beheld
all
the
colors
that
glow
in
the
plumage
of
the
feathered
tribes
of
india
and
america
instead
of
the
sober
european
families
those
were
two
wretched
hours
that
lucien
spent
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
a
violent
revulsion
swept
through
him
and
he
sat
in
judgment
upon
himself
in
the
first
place
not
a
single
one
of
these
gilded
youths
wore
a
coat
the
few
exceptions
one
or
two
poor
wretches
a
clerk
here
and
there
an
annuitant
from
the
marais
could
be
ruled
out
on
the
score
of
age
and
hard
upon
the
discovery
of
a
distinction
between
morning
and
evening
dress
the
poet
s
quick
sensibility
and
keen
eyes
saw
likewise
that
his
shabby
old
clothes
were
not
fit
to
be
seen
the
defects
in
his
coat
branded
that
garment
as
ridiculous
the
cut
was
the
color
was
the
wrong
shade
of
blue
the
collar
outrageously
ungainly
the
coat
tails
by
dint
of
long
wear
overlapped
each
other
the
buttons
were
reddened
and
there
were
fatal
white
lines
along
the
seams
then
his
waistcoat
was
too
short
and
so
grotesquely
provincial
that
he
hastily
buttoned
his
coat
over
it
and
finally
no
man
of
any
pretension
to
fashion
wore
nankeen
trousers
men
wore
charming
fancy
materials
or
immaculate
white
and
every
one
had
straps
to
his
trousers
while
the
shrunken
hems
of
lucien
s
nether
garments
manifested
a
violent
antipathy
for
the
heels
of
boots
which
they
wedded
with
obvious
reluctance
lucien
wore
a
white
cravat
with
embroidered
ends
his
sister
had
seen
that
du
hautoy
and
de
chandour
wore
such
things
and
hastened
to
make
similar
ones
for
her
brother
here
no
one
appeared
to
wear
white
cravats
of
a
morning
except
a
few
grave
seniors
elderly
capitalists
and
austere
public
functionaries
until
in
the
street
on
the
other
side
of
the
railings
lucien
noticed
a
grocer
s
boy
walking
along
the
rue
de
rivoli
with
a
basket
on
his
head
him
the
man
of
angouleme
detected
in
the
act
of
sporting
a
cravat
with
both
ends
adorned
by
the
handiwork
of
some
adored
the
sight
was
a
stab
to
lucien
s
breast
penetrating
straight
to
that
organ
as
yet
undefined
the
seat
of
our
sensibility
the
region
whither
since
sentiment
has
had
any
existence
the
sons
of
men
carry
their
hands
in
any
excess
of
joy
or
anguish
do
not
accuse
this
chronicle
of
puerility
the
rich
to
be
sure
never
having
experienced
sufferings
of
this
kind
may
think
them
incredibly
petty
and
small
but
the
agonies
of
less
fortunate
mortals
are
as
well
worth
our
attention
as
crises
and
vicissitudes
in
the
lives
of
the
mighty
and
privileged
ones
of
earth
is
not
the
pain
equally
great
for
either
suffering
exalts
all
things
and
after
all
suppose
that
we
change
the
terms
and
for
a
suit
of
clothes
more
or
less
fine
put
instead
a
ribbon
or
a
star
or
a
title
have
not
brilliant
careers
been
tormented
by
reason
of
such
apparent
trifles
as
these
add
moreover
that
for
those
people
who
must
seem
to
have
that
which
they
have
not
the
question
of
clothes
is
of
enormous
importance
and
not
unfrequently
the
appearance
of
possession
is
the
shortest
road
to
possession
at
a
later
day
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
over
lucien
as
he
bethought
himself
that
he
must
make
his
first
appearance
before
the
marquise
in
this
dress
the
marquise
d
espard
relative
of
a
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
a
woman
whose
house
was
frequented
by
the
most
illustrious
among
illustrious
men
in
every
field
i
look
like
an
apothecary
s
son
a
regular
he
raged
inwardly
watching
the
youth
of
the
faubourg
pass
under
his
eyes
graceful
spruce
fashionably
dressed
with
a
certain
uniformity
of
air
a
sameness
due
to
a
fineness
of
contour
and
a
certain
dignity
of
carriage
and
expression
though
at
the
same
time
each
one
differed
from
the
rest
in
the
setting
by
which
he
had
chosen
to
bring
his
personal
characteristics
into
prominence
each
one
made
the
most
of
his
personal
advantages
young
men
in
paris
understand
the
art
of
presenting
themselves
quite
as
well
as
women
lucien
had
inherited
from
his
mother
the
invaluable
physical
distinction
of
race
but
the
metal
was
still
in
the
ore
and
not
set
free
by
the
craftsman
s
hand
his
hair
was
badly
cut
instead
of
holding
himself
upright
with
an
elastic
corset
he
felt
that
he
was
cooped
up
inside
a
hideous
he
hung
his
dejected
head
without
resistance
on
the
part
of
a
limp
cravat
what
woman
could
guess
that
a
handsome
foot
was
hidden
by
the
clumsy
boots
which
he
had
brought
from
angouleme
what
young
man
could
envy
him
his
graceful
figure
disguised
by
the
shapeless
blue
sack
which
hitherto
he
had
mistakenly
believed
to
be
a
coat
what
bewitching
studs
he
saw
on
those
dazzling
white
shirt
fronts
his
own
looked
dingy
by
comparison
and
how
marvelously
all
these
elegant
persons
were
gloved
his
own
gloves
were
only
fit
for
a
policeman
yonder
was
a
youth
toying
with
a
cane
exquisitely
mounted
there
another
with
dainty
gold
studs
in
his
wristbands
yet
another
was
twisting
a
charming
while
he
talked
with
a
woman
there
were
specks
of
mud
on
the
ample
folds
of
his
white
trousers
he
wore
clanking
spurs
and
a
jacket
evidently
he
was
about
to
mount
one
of
the
two
horses
held
by
a
of
a
tiger
a
young
man
who
went
past
drew
a
watch
no
thicker
than
a
piece
from
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
with
the
air
of
a
person
who
is
either
too
early
or
too
late
for
an
appointment
lucien
seeing
these
petty
trifles
hitherto
unimagined
became
aware
of
a
whole
world
of
indispensable
superfluities
and
shuddered
to
think
of
the
enormous
capital
needed
by
a
professional
pretty
fellow
the
more
he
admired
these
gay
and
careless
beings
the
more
conscious
he
grew
of
his
own
outlandishness
he
knew
that
he
looked
like
a
man
who
has
no
idea
of
the
direction
of
the
streets
who
stands
close
to
the
palais
royal
and
can
not
find
it
and
asks
his
way
to
the
louvre
of
a
who
tells
him
here
you
lucien
saw
a
great
gulf
fixed
between
him
and
this
new
world
and
asked
himself
how
he
might
cross
over
for
he
meant
to
be
one
of
these
delicate
slim
youths
of
paris
these
young
patricians
who
bowed
before
women
divinely
dressed
and
divinely
fair
for
one
kiss
from
one
of
these
lucien
was
ready
to
be
cut
in
pieces
like
count
philip
of
konigsmark
louise
s
face
rose
up
somewhere
in
the
shadowy
background
of
memory
compared
with
these
queens
she
looked
like
an
old
woman
he
saw
women
whose
names
will
appear
in
the
history
of
the
nineteenth
century
women
no
less
famous
than
the
queens
of
past
times
for
their
wit
their
beauty
or
their
lovers
one
who
passed
was
the
heroine
mlle
des
touches
so
well
known
as
camille
maupin
the
great
woman
of
letters
great
by
her
intellect
great
no
less
by
her
beauty
he
overheard
the
name
pronounced
by
those
who
went
by
ah
he
thought
to
himself
she
is
what
was
mme
de
bargeton
in
comparison
with
this
angel
in
all
the
glory
of
youth
and
hope
and
promise
of
the
future
with
that
sweet
smile
of
hers
and
the
great
dark
eyes
with
all
heaven
in
them
and
the
glowing
light
of
the
sun
she
was
laughing
and
chatting
with
mme
firmiani
one
of
the
most
charming
women
in
paris
a
voice
indeed
cried
intellect
is
the
lever
by
which
to
move
the
world
but
another
voice
cried
no
less
loudly
that
money
was
the
fulcrum
he
would
not
stay
any
longer
on
the
scene
of
his
collapse
and
defeat
and
went
towards
the
palais
royal
he
did
not
know
the
topography
of
his
quarter
yet
and
was
obliged
to
ask
his
way
then
he
went
to
very
s
and
ordered
dinner
by
way
of
an
initiation
into
the
pleasures
of
paris
and
a
solace
for
his
discouragement
a
bottle
of
bordeaux
oysters
from
ostend
a
dish
of
fish
a
partridge
a
dish
of
macaroni
and
dessert
this
was
the
plus
of
his
desire
he
enjoyed
this
little
debauch
studying
the
while
how
to
give
the
marquise
d
espard
proof
of
his
wit
and
redeem
the
shabbiness
of
his
grotesque
accoutrements
by
the
display
of
intellectual
riches
the
total
of
the
bill
drew
him
down
from
these
dreams
and
left
him
the
poorer
by
fifty
of
the
francs
which
were
to
have
gone
such
a
long
way
in
paris
he
could
have
lived
in
angouleme
for
a
month
on
the
price
of
that
dinner
wherefore
he
closed
the
door
of
the
palace
with
awe
thinking
as
he
did
so
that
he
should
never
set
foot
in
it
again
eve
was
right
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
back
under
the
stone
arcading
for
some
more
money
there
is
a
difference
between
paris
prices
and
prices
in
l
he
gazed
in
at
the
tailors
windows
on
the
way
and
thought
of
the
costumes
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
no
he
exclaimed
i
will
appear
before
mme
d
espard
dressed
out
as
i
he
fled
to
his
inn
fleet
as
a
stag
rushed
up
to
his
room
took
out
a
hundred
crowns
and
went
down
again
to
the
palais
royal
where
his
future
elegance
lay
scattered
over
half
a
score
of
shops
the
first
tailor
whose
door
he
entered
tried
as
many
coats
upon
him
as
he
would
consent
to
put
on
and
persuaded
his
customer
that
all
were
in
the
very
latest
fashion
lucien
came
out
the
owner
of
a
green
coat
a
pair
of
white
trousers
and
a
fancy
waistcoat
for
which
outfit
he
gave
two
hundred
francs
ere
long
he
found
a
very
elegant
pair
of
shoes
that
fitted
his
foot
and
finally
when
he
had
made
all
necessary
purchases
he
ordered
the
tradespeople
to
send
them
to
his
address
and
inquired
for
a
hairdresser
at
seven
o
clock
that
evening
he
called
a
cab
and
drove
away
to
the
opera
curled
like
a
saint
john
of
a
procession
day
elegantly
waistcoated
and
gloved
but
feeling
a
little
awkward
in
this
kind
of
sheath
in
which
he
found
himself
for
the
first
time
in
obedience
to
mme
de
bargeton
s
instructions
he
asked
for
the
box
reserved
for
the
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
the
man
at
the
box
office
looked
at
him
and
beholding
lucien
in
all
the
grandeur
assumed
for
the
occasion
in
which
he
looked
like
a
best
man
at
a
wedding
asked
lucien
for
his
order
i
have
no
then
you
can
not
go
in
said
the
man
at
the
box
office
drily
but
i
belong
to
mme
d
espard
s
it
is
not
our
business
to
know
that
said
the
man
who
could
not
help
exchanging
a
barely
perceptible
smile
with
his
colleague
a
carriage
stopped
under
the
peristyle
as
he
spoke
a
chasseur
in
a
livery
which
lucien
did
not
recognize
let
down
the
step
and
two
women
in
evening
dress
came
out
of
the
brougham
lucien
had
no
mind
to
lay
himself
open
to
an
insolent
order
to
get
out
of
the
way
from
the
official
he
stepped
aside
to
let
the
two
ladies
pass
why
that
lady
is
the
marquise
d
espard
whom
you
say
you
know
sir
said
the
man
ironically
lucien
was
so
much
the
more
confounded
because
mme
de
bargeton
did
not
seem
to
recognize
him
in
his
new
plumage
but
when
he
stepped
up
to
her
she
smiled
at
him
and
said
this
has
fallen
out
wonderfully
come
the
functionaries
at
the
box
office
grew
serious
again
as
lucien
followed
mme
de
bargeton
on
their
way
up
the
great
staircase
the
lady
introduced
de
rubempre
to
her
cousin
the
box
belonging
to
the
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
is
situated
in
one
of
the
angles
at
the
back
of
the
house
so
that
its
occupants
see
and
are
seen
all
over
the
theatre
lucien
took
his
seat
on
a
chair
behind
mme
de
bargeton
thankful
to
be
in
the
shadow
m
de
rubempre
said
the
marquise
with
flattering
graciousness
this
is
your
first
visit
to
the
opera
is
it
not
you
must
have
a
view
of
the
house
take
this
seat
sit
in
front
of
the
box
we
give
you
lucien
obeyed
as
the
first
act
came
to
an
end
you
have
made
good
use
of
your
time
louise
said
in
his
ear
in
her
first
surprise
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
louise
was
still
the
same
the
near
presence
of
the
marquise
d
espard
a
parisian
mme
de
bargeton
was
so
damaging
to
her
the
brilliancy
of
the
parisienne
brought
out
all
the
defects
in
her
country
cousin
so
clearly
by
contrast
that
lucien
looking
out
over
the
fashionable
audience
in
the
superb
building
and
then
at
the
great
lady
was
twice
enlightened
and
saw
poor
anais
de
negrepelisse
as
she
really
was
as
parisians
saw
her
a
tall
lean
withered
woman
with
a
pimpled
face
and
faded
complexion
angular
stiff
affected
in
her
manner
pompous
and
provincial
in
her
speech
and
and
above
all
these
things
dowdily
dressed
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
creases
in
an
old
dress
from
paris
still
bear
witness
to
good
taste
you
can
tell
what
the
gown
was
meant
for
but
an
old
dress
made
in
the
country
is
inexplicable
it
is
a
thing
to
provoke
laughter
there
was
neither
charm
nor
freshness
about
the
dress
or
its
wearer
the
velvet
like
the
complexion
had
seen
wear
lucien
felt
ashamed
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
this
bone
and
vowed
that
he
would
profit
by
louise
s
next
fit
of
virtue
to
leave
her
for
good
having
an
excellent
view
of
the
house
he
could
see
the
pointed
at
the
aristocratic
box
par
excellence
the
women
must
certainly
be
scrutinizing
mme
de
bargeton
for
they
smiled
and
talked
among
themselves
if
mme
d
espard
knew
the
object
of
their
sarcasms
from
those
feminine
smiles
and
gestures
she
was
perfectly
insensible
to
them
in
the
first
place
anybody
must
see
that
her
companion
was
a
poor
relation
from
the
country
an
affliction
with
which
any
parisian
family
may
be
visited
and
in
the
second
when
her
cousin
had
spoken
to
her
of
her
dress
with
manifest
misgivings
she
had
reassured
anais
seeing
that
when
once
properly
dressed
her
relative
would
very
easily
acquire
the
tone
of
parisian
society
if
mme
de
bargeton
needed
polish
on
the
other
hand
she
possessed
the
native
haughtiness
of
good
birth
and
that
indescribable
something
which
may
be
called
so
on
monday
her
turn
would
come
and
moreover
the
marquise
knew
that
as
soon
as
people
learned
that
the
stranger
was
her
cousin
they
would
suspend
their
banter
and
look
twice
before
they
condemned
her
lucien
did
not
foresee
the
change
in
louise
s
appearance
shortly
to
be
worked
by
a
scarf
about
her
throat
a
pretty
dress
an
elegant
coiffure
and
mme
d
espard
s
advice
as
they
came
up
the
staircase
even
now
the
marquise
told
her
cousin
not
to
hold
her
handkerchief
unfolded
in
her
hand
good
or
bad
taste
turns
upon
hundreds
of
such
almost
imperceptible
shades
which
a
woman
discerns
at
once
while
others
will
never
grasp
them
mme
de
bargeton
plentifully
apt
was
more
than
clever
enough
to
discover
her
shortcomings
mme
d
espard
sure
that
her
pupil
would
do
her
credit
did
not
decline
to
form
her
in
short
the
compact
between
the
two
women
had
been
confirmed
by
on
either
side
mme
de
bargeton
enthralled
dazzled
and
fascinated
by
her
cousin
s
manner
wit
and
acquaintances
had
suddenly
declared
herself
a
votary
of
the
idol
of
the
day
she
had
discerned
the
signs
of
the
occult
power
exerted
by
the
ambitious
great
lady
and
told
herself
that
she
could
gain
her
end
as
the
satellite
of
this
star
so
she
had
been
outspoken
in
her
admiration
the
marquise
was
not
insensible
to
the
artlessly
admitted
conquest
she
took
an
interest
in
her
cousin
seeing
that
she
was
weak
and
poor
she
was
besides
not
indisposed
to
take
a
pupil
with
whom
to
found
a
school
and
asked
nothing
better
than
to
have
a
sort
of
in
mme
de
bargeton
a
dependent
who
would
sing
her
praises
a
treasure
even
more
scarce
among
parisian
women
than
a
staunch
and
loyal
critic
among
the
literary
tribe
the
flutter
of
curiosity
in
the
house
was
too
marked
to
be
ignored
however
and
mme
d
espard
politely
endeavored
to
turn
her
cousin
s
mind
from
the
truth
if
any
one
comes
to
our
box
she
said
perhaps
we
may
discover
the
cause
to
which
we
owe
the
honor
of
the
interest
that
these
ladies
are
taking
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
it
is
my
old
velvet
gown
and
angoumoisin
air
which
parisian
ladies
find
amusing
mme
de
bargeton
answered
laughing
no
it
is
not
you
it
is
something
that
i
can
not
explain
she
added
turning
to
the
poet
and
as
she
looked
at
him
for
the
first
time
it
seemed
to
strike
her
that
he
was
singularly
dressed
there
is
du
chatelet
exclaimed
lucien
at
that
moment
and
he
pointed
a
finger
towards
mme
de
serizy
s
box
which
the
renovated
beau
had
just
entered
mme
de
bargeton
bit
her
lips
with
chagrin
as
she
saw
that
gesture
and
saw
besides
the
marquise
s
smile
of
contemptuous
astonishment
where
does
the
young
man
come
from
her
look
said
and
louise
felt
humbled
through
her
love
one
of
the
sharpest
of
all
pangs
for
a
frenchwoman
a
mortification
for
which
she
can
not
forgive
her
lover
in
these
circles
where
trifles
are
of
such
importance
a
gesture
or
a
word
at
the
outset
is
enough
to
ruin
a
newcomer
it
is
the
principal
merit
of
fine
manners
and
the
highest
breeding
that
they
produce
the
effect
of
a
harmonious
whole
in
which
every
element
is
so
blended
that
nothing
is
startling
or
obtrusive
even
those
who
break
the
laws
of
this
science
either
through
ignorance
or
carried
away
by
some
impulse
must
comprehend
that
it
is
with
social
intercourse
as
with
music
a
single
discordant
note
is
a
complete
negation
of
the
art
itself
for
the
harmony
exists
only
when
all
its
conditions
are
observed
down
to
the
least
particular
who
is
that
gentleman
asked
mme
d
espard
looking
towards
chatelet
and
have
you
made
mme
de
serizy
s
acquaintance
already
oh
is
that
the
famous
mme
de
serizy
who
has
had
so
many
adventures
and
yet
goes
everywhere
an
my
dear
explicable
but
unexplained
the
most
formidable
men
are
her
friends
and
why
nobody
dares
to
fathom
the
mystery
then
is
this
person
the
lion
of
angouleme
well
le
baron
du
chatelet
has
been
a
good
deal
talked
about
answered
mme
de
bargeton
moved
by
vanity
to
give
her
adorer
the
title
which
she
herself
had
called
in
question
he
was
de
montriveau
s
traveling
ah
said
the
marquise
d
espard
i
never
hear
that
name
without
thinking
of
the
duchesse
de
langeais
poor
thing
she
vanished
like
a
falling
that
is
de
rastignac
with
mme
de
nucingen
she
continued
indicating
another
box
she
is
the
wife
of
a
contractor
a
banker
a
city
man
a
broker
on
a
large
scale
he
forced
his
way
into
society
with
his
money
and
they
say
that
he
is
not
very
scrupulous
as
to
his
methods
of
making
it
he
is
at
endless
pains
to
establish
his
credit
as
a
staunch
upholder
of
the
bourbons
and
has
tried
already
to
gain
admittance
into
my
set
when
his
wife
took
mme
de
langeais
box
she
thought
that
she
could
take
her
charm
her
wit
and
her
success
as
well
it
is
the
old
fable
of
the
jay
in
the
peacock
s
feathers
how
do
and
mme
de
rastignac
manage
to
keep
their
son
in
paris
when
as
we
know
their
income
is
under
a
thousand
crowns
asked
lucien
in
his
astonishment
at
rastignac
s
elegant
and
expensive
dress
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
come
from
angouleme
said
mme
d
espard
ironically
enough
as
she
continued
to
gaze
through
her
her
remark
was
lost
upon
lucien
the
spectacle
of
the
boxes
prevented
him
from
thinking
of
anything
else
he
guessed
that
he
himself
was
an
object
of
no
small
curiosity
louise
on
the
other
hand
was
exceedingly
mortified
by
the
evident
slight
esteem
in
which
the
marquise
held
lucien
s
beauty
he
can
not
be
so
handsome
as
i
thought
him
she
said
to
herself
and
between
not
so
handsome
and
not
so
clever
as
i
thought
him
there
was
but
one
step
the
curtain
fell
chatelet
was
now
paying
a
visit
to
the
duchesse
de
carigliano
in
an
adjourning
box
mme
de
bargeton
acknowledged
his
bow
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
nothing
escapes
a
woman
of
the
world
chatelet
s
air
of
distinction
was
not
lost
upon
mme
d
espard
just
at
that
moment
four
personages
four
parisian
celebrities
came
into
the
box
one
after
another
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
first
comer
de
marsay
famous
for
the
passions
which
he
had
inspired
was
his
girlish
beauty
but
its
softness
and
effeminacy
were
counteracted
by
the
expression
of
his
eyes
unflinching
steady
untamed
and
hard
as
a
tiger
s
he
was
loved
and
he
was
feared
lucien
was
no
less
handsome
but
lucien
s
expression
was
so
gentle
his
blue
eyes
so
limpid
that
he
scarcely
seemed
to
possess
the
strength
and
the
power
which
attract
women
so
strongly
nothing
moreover
so
far
had
brought
out
the
poet
s
merits
while
de
marsay
with
his
flow
of
spirits
his
confidence
in
his
power
to
please
and
appropriate
style
of
dress
eclipsed
every
rival
by
his
presence
judge
therefore
the
kind
of
figure
that
lucien
stiff
starched
unbending
in
clothes
as
new
and
unfamiliar
as
his
surroundings
was
likely
to
cut
in
de
marsay
s
vicinity
de
marsay
with
his
wit
and
charm
of
manner
was
privileged
to
be
insolent
from
mme
d
espard
s
reception
of
this
personage
his
importance
was
at
once
evident
to
mme
de
bargeton
the
second
comer
was
a
vandenesse
the
cause
of
the
scandal
in
which
lady
dudley
was
concerned
felix
de
vandenesse
amiable
intellectual
and
modest
had
none
of
the
characteristics
on
which
de
marsay
prided
himself
and
owed
his
success
to
diametrically
opposed
qualities
he
had
been
warmly
recommended
to
mme
d
espard
by
her
cousin
mme
de
mortsauf
the
third
was
general
de
montriveau
the
author
of
the
duchesse
de
langeais
ruin
the
fourth
de
canalis
one
of
the
most
famous
poets
of
the
day
and
as
yet
a
newly
risen
celebrity
was
prouder
of
his
birth
than
of
his
genius
and
dangled
in
mme
d
espard
s
train
by
way
of
concealing
his
love
for
the
duchesse
de
chaulieu
in
spite
of
his
graces
and
the
affectation
that
spoiled
them
it
was
easy
to
discern
the
vast
lurking
ambitions
that
plunged
him
at
a
later
day
into
the
storms
of
political
life
a
face
that
might
be
called
insignificantly
pretty
and
caressing
manners
thinly
disguised
the
man
s
egoism
and
habit
of
continually
calculating
the
chances
of
a
career
which
at
that
time
looked
problematical
enough
though
his
choice
of
mme
de
chaulieu
a
woman
past
forty
made
interest
for
him
at
court
and
brought
him
the
applause
of
the
faubourg
and
the
gibes
of
the
liberal
party
who
dubbed
him
the
poet
of
the
mme
de
bargeton
with
these
remarkable
figures
before
her
no
longer
wondered
at
the
slight
esteem
in
which
the
marquise
held
lucien
s
good
looks
and
when
conversation
began
when
intellects
so
keen
so
subtle
were
revealed
in
words
with
more
meaning
and
depth
in
them
than
anais
de
bargeton
heard
in
a
month
of
talk
at
angouleme
and
most
of
all
when
canalis
uttered
a
sonorous
phrase
summing
up
a
materialistic
epoch
and
gilding
it
with
poetry
then
anais
felt
all
the
truth
of
chatelet
s
dictum
of
the
previous
evening
lucien
was
nothing
to
her
now
every
one
cruelly
ignored
the
unlucky
stranger
he
was
so
much
like
a
foreigner
listening
to
an
unknown
language
that
the
marquise
d
espard
took
pity
upon
him
she
turned
to
canalis
permit
me
to
introduce
de
rubempre
she
said
you
rank
too
high
in
the
world
of
letters
not
to
welcome
a
de
rubempre
is
from
angouleme
and
will
need
your
influence
no
doubt
with
the
powers
that
bring
genius
to
light
so
far
he
has
no
enemies
to
help
him
to
success
by
their
attacks
upon
him
is
there
enough
originality
in
the
idea
of
obtaining
for
him
by
friendship
all
that
hatred
has
done
for
you
to
tempt
you
to
make
the
experiment
the
four
newcomers
all
looked
at
lucien
while
the
marquise
was
speaking
de
marsay
only
a
couple
of
paces
away
put
up
an
eyeglass
and
looked
from
lucien
to
mme
de
bargeton
and
then
again
at
lucien
coupling
them
with
some
mocking
thought
cruelly
mortifying
to
both
he
scrutinized
them
as
if
they
had
been
a
pair
of
strange
animals
and
then
he
smiled
the
smile
was
like
a
stab
to
the
distinguished
provincial
felix
de
vandenesse
assumed
a
charitable
air
montriveau
looked
lucien
through
and
through
madame
de
canalis
answered
with
a
bow
i
will
obey
you
in
spite
of
the
selfish
instinct
which
prompts
us
to
show
a
rival
no
favor
but
you
have
accustomed
us
to
very
well
do
me
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
me
on
monday
with
de
rubempre
and
you
can
talk
of
matters
literary
at
your
ease
i
will
try
to
enlist
some
of
the
tyrants
of
the
world
of
letters
and
the
great
people
who
protect
them
the
author
of
and
one
or
two
young
poets
with
sound
mme
la
marquise
said
de
marsay
if
you
give
your
support
to
this
gentleman
for
his
intellect
i
will
support
him
for
his
good
looks
i
will
give
him
advice
which
will
put
him
in
a
fair
way
to
be
the
luckiest
dandy
in
paris
after
that
he
may
be
a
poet
if
he
has
a
mme
de
bargeton
thanked
her
cousin
by
a
grateful
glance
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
jealous
of
intellect
montriveau
said
turning
to
de
marsay
good
fortune
is
the
death
of
a
is
that
why
your
lordship
is
thinking
of
marriage
inquired
the
dandy
addressing
canalis
and
watching
mme
d
espard
to
see
if
the
words
went
home
canalis
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
mme
d
espard
mme
de
chaulieu
s
niece
began
to
laugh
lucien
in
his
new
clothes
felt
as
if
he
were
an
egyptian
statue
in
its
narrow
sheath
he
was
ashamed
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
for
himself
all
this
while
at
length
he
turned
to
the
marquise
after
all
your
kindness
madame
i
am
pledged
to
make
no
failures
he
said
in
those
soft
tones
of
his
chatelet
came
in
as
he
spoke
he
had
seen
montriveau
and
by
hook
or
crook
snatched
at
the
chance
of
a
good
introduction
to
the
marquise
d
espard
through
one
of
the
kings
of
paris
he
bowed
to
mme
de
bargeton
and
begged
mme
d
espard
to
pardon
him
for
the
liberty
he
took
in
invading
her
box
he
had
been
separated
so
long
from
his
traveling
companion
montriveau
and
chatelet
met
for
the
first
time
since
they
parted
in
the
desert
to
part
in
the
desert
and
meet
again
in
the
said
lucien
quite
a
theatrical
meeting
said
canalis
montriveau
introduced
the
baron
du
chatelet
to
the
marquise
and
the
marquise
received
her
royal
highness
the
more
graciously
because
she
had
seen
that
he
had
been
very
well
received
in
three
boxes
already
mme
de
serizy
knew
none
but
unexceptionable
people
and
moreover
he
was
montriveau
s
traveling
companion
so
potent
was
this
last
credential
that
mme
de
bargeton
saw
from
the
manner
of
the
group
that
they
accepted
chatelet
as
one
of
themselves
without
demur
chatelet
s
sultan
s
airs
in
angouleme
were
suddenly
explained
at
length
the
baron
saw
lucien
and
favored
him
with
a
cool
disparaging
little
nod
indicative
to
men
of
the
world
of
the
recipient
s
inferior
station
a
sardonic
expression
accompanied
the
greeting
how
does
come
here
he
seemed
to
say
this
was
not
lost
on
those
who
saw
it
for
de
marsay
leaned
towards
montriveau
and
said
in
tones
audible
to
chatelet
do
ask
him
who
the
young
fellow
is
that
looks
like
a
dummy
at
a
tailor
s
chatelet
spoke
a
few
words
in
his
traveling
companion
s
ear
and
while
apparently
renewing
his
acquaintance
no
doubt
cut
his
rival
to
pieces
if
lucien
was
surprised
at
the
apt
wit
and
the
subtlety
with
which
these
gentlemen
formulated
their
replies
he
felt
bewildered
with
epigram
and
repartee
and
most
of
all
by
their
offhand
way
of
talking
and
their
ease
of
manner
the
material
luxury
of
paris
had
alarmed
him
that
morning
at
night
he
saw
the
same
lavish
expenditure
of
intellect
by
what
mysterious
means
he
asked
himself
did
these
people
make
such
piquant
reflections
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
those
repartees
which
he
could
only
have
made
after
much
pondering
and
not
only
were
they
at
ease
in
their
speech
they
were
at
ease
in
their
dress
nothing
looked
new
nothing
looked
old
nothing
about
them
was
conspicuous
everything
attracted
the
eyes
the
fine
gentleman
of
was
the
same
yesterday
and
would
be
the
same
lucien
guessed
that
he
himself
looked
as
if
he
were
dressed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
my
dear
fellow
said
de
marsay
addressing
felix
de
vandenesse
that
young
rastignac
is
soaring
away
like
a
look
at
him
in
the
marquise
de
listomere
s
box
he
is
making
progress
he
is
putting
up
his
eyeglass
at
us
he
knows
this
gentleman
no
doubt
added
the
dandy
speaking
to
lucien
and
looking
elsewhere
he
can
scarcely
fail
to
have
heard
the
name
of
a
great
man
of
whom
we
are
proud
said
mme
de
bargeton
quite
lately
his
sister
was
present
when
de
rubempre
read
us
some
very
fine
felix
de
vandenesse
and
de
marsay
took
leave
of
the
marquise
d
espard
and
went
off
to
mme
de
listomere
vandenesse
s
sister
the
second
act
began
and
the
three
were
left
to
themselves
again
the
curious
women
learned
how
mme
de
bargeton
came
to
be
there
from
some
of
the
party
while
the
others
announced
the
arrival
of
a
poet
and
made
fun
of
his
costume
canalis
went
back
to
the
duchesse
de
chaulieu
and
no
more
was
seen
of
him
lucien
was
glad
when
the
rising
of
the
curtain
produced
a
diversion
all
mme
de
bargeton
s
misgivings
with
regard
to
lucien
were
increased
by
the
marked
attention
which
the
marquise
d
espard
had
shown
to
chatelet
her
manner
towards
the
baron
was
very
different
from
the
patronizing
affability
with
which
she
treated
lucien
mme
de
listomere
s
box
was
full
during
the
second
act
and
to
all
appearance
the
talk
turned
upon
mme
de
bargeton
and
lucien
young
rastignac
evidently
was
entertaining
the
party
he
had
raised
the
laughter
that
needs
fresh
fuel
every
day
in
paris
the
laughter
that
seizes
upon
a
topic
and
exhausts
it
and
leaves
it
stale
and
threadbare
in
a
moment
mme
d
espard
grew
uneasy
she
knew
that
an
speech
is
not
long
in
coming
to
the
ears
of
those
whom
it
will
wound
and
waited
till
the
end
of
the
act
after
a
revulsion
of
feeling
such
as
had
taken
place
in
mme
de
bargeton
and
lucien
strange
things
come
to
pass
in
a
brief
space
of
time
and
any
revolution
within
us
is
controlled
by
laws
that
work
with
great
swiftness
chatelet
s
sage
and
politic
words
as
to
lucien
spoken
on
the
way
home
from
the
vaudeville
were
fresh
in
louise
s
memory
every
phrase
was
a
prophecy
it
seemed
as
if
lucien
had
set
himself
to
fulfil
the
predictions
one
by
one
when
lucien
and
mme
de
bargeton
had
parted
with
their
illusions
concerning
each
other
the
luckless
youth
with
a
destiny
not
unlike
rousseau
s
went
so
far
in
his
predecessor
s
footsteps
that
he
was
captivated
by
the
great
lady
and
smitten
with
mme
d
espard
at
first
sight
young
men
and
men
who
remember
their
young
emotions
can
see
that
this
was
only
what
might
have
been
looked
for
mme
d
espard
with
her
dainty
ways
her
delicate
enunciation
and
the
refined
tones
of
her
voice
the
fragile
woman
so
envied
of
such
high
place
and
high
degree
appeared
before
the
poet
as
mme
de
bargeton
had
appeared
to
him
in
angouleme
his
fickle
nature
prompted
him
to
desire
influence
in
that
lofty
sphere
at
once
and
the
surest
way
to
secure
such
influence
was
to
possess
the
woman
who
exerted
it
and
then
everything
would
be
his
he
had
succeeded
at
angouleme
why
should
he
not
succeed
in
paris
involuntarily
and
despite
the
novel
counter
fascination
of
the
stage
his
eyes
turned
to
the
celimene
in
her
splendor
he
glanced
furtively
at
her
every
moment
the
longer
he
looked
the
more
he
desired
to
look
at
her
mme
de
bargeton
caught
the
gleam
in
lucien
s
eyes
and
saw
that
he
found
the
marquise
more
interesting
than
the
opera
if
lucien
had
forsaken
her
for
the
fifty
daughters
of
danaus
she
could
have
borne
his
desertion
with
equanimity
but
another
glance
bolder
more
ardent
and
unmistakable
than
any
before
revealed
the
state
of
lucien
s
feelings
she
grew
jealous
but
not
so
much
for
the
future
as
for
the
past
he
never
gave
me
such
a
look
she
thought
dear
me
chatelet
was
right
then
she
saw
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
and
when
a
woman
once
begins
to
repent
of
her
weaknesses
she
sponges
out
the
whole
past
every
one
of
lucien
s
glances
roused
her
indignation
but
to
all
outward
appearance
she
was
calm
de
marsay
came
back
in
the
interval
bringing
de
listomere
with
him
and
that
serious
person
and
the
young
coxcomb
soon
informed
the
marquise
that
the
wedding
guest
in
his
holiday
suit
whom
she
had
the
bad
luck
to
have
in
her
box
had
as
much
right
to
the
appellation
of
rubempre
as
a
jew
to
a
baptismal
name
lucien
s
father
was
an
apothecary
named
chardon
de
rastignac
who
knew
all
about
angouleme
had
set
several
boxes
laughing
already
at
the
mummy
whom
the
marquise
styled
her
cousin
and
at
the
marquise
s
forethought
in
having
an
apothecary
at
hand
to
sustain
an
artificial
life
with
drugs
in
short
de
marsay
brought
a
selection
from
the
jokes
made
by
parisians
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
no
sooner
uttered
than
forgotten
chatelet
was
at
the
back
of
it
all
and
the
real
author
of
this
punic
faith
mme
d
espard
turned
to
mme
de
bargeton
put
up
her
fan
and
said
my
dear
tell
me
if
your
protege
s
name
is
really
de
rubempre
he
has
assumed
his
mother
s
name
said
anais
uneasily
but
who
was
his
father
his
father
s
name
was
and
what
was
this
chardon
a
my
dear
friend
i
felt
quite
sure
that
all
paris
could
not
be
laughing
at
any
one
whom
i
took
up
i
do
not
care
to
stay
here
when
wags
come
in
in
high
glee
because
there
is
an
apothecary
s
son
in
my
box
if
you
will
follow
my
advice
we
will
leave
it
and
at
mme
d
espard
s
expression
was
insolent
enough
lucien
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
her
change
of
countenance
he
thought
that
his
waistcoat
was
in
bad
taste
which
was
true
and
that
his
coat
looked
like
a
caricature
of
the
fashion
which
was
likewise
true
he
discerned
in
bitterness
of
soul
that
he
must
put
himself
in
the
hands
of
an
expert
tailor
and
vowed
that
he
would
go
the
very
next
morning
to
the
most
celebrated
artist
in
paris
on
monday
he
would
hold
his
own
with
the
men
in
the
marquise
s
house
yet
lost
in
thought
though
he
was
he
saw
the
third
act
to
an
end
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
gorgeous
scene
upon
the
stage
dreamed
out
his
dream
of
mme
d
espard
he
was
in
despair
over
her
sudden
coldness
it
gave
a
strange
check
to
the
ardent
reasoning
through
which
he
advanced
upon
this
new
love
undismayed
by
the
immense
difficulties
in
the
way
difficulties
which
he
saw
and
resolved
to
conquer
he
roused
himself
from
these
deep
musings
to
look
once
more
at
his
new
idol
turned
his
head
and
saw
that
he
was
alone
he
had
heard
a
faint
rustling
sound
the
door
closed
madame
d
espard
had
taken
her
cousin
with
her
lucien
was
surprised
to
the
last
degree
by
the
sudden
desertion
he
did
not
think
long
about
it
however
simply
because
it
was
inexplicable
when
the
carriage
was
rolling
along
the
rue
de
richelieu
on
the
way
to
the
faubourg
the
marquise
spoke
to
her
cousin
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
irritation
my
dear
child
what
are
you
thinking
about
pray
wait
till
an
apothecary
s
son
has
made
a
name
for
himself
before
you
trouble
yourself
about
him
the
duchesse
de
chaulieu
does
not
acknowledge
canalis
even
now
and
he
is
famous
and
a
man
of
good
family
this
young
fellow
is
neither
your
son
nor
your
lover
i
suppose
added
the
haughty
dame
with
a
keen
inquisitive
glance
at
her
cousin
how
fortunate
for
me
that
i
kept
the
little
scapegrace
at
a
distance
thought
madame
de
bargeton
very
well
continued
the
marquise
taking
the
expression
in
her
cousin
s
eyes
for
an
answer
drop
him
i
beg
of
you
taking
an
illustrious
name
in
that
way
why
it
is
a
piece
of
impudence
that
will
meet
with
its
desserts
in
society
it
is
his
mother
s
name
i
dare
say
but
just
remember
dear
that
the
king
alone
can
confer
by
a
special
ordinance
the
title
of
de
rubempre
on
the
son
of
a
daughter
of
the
house
if
she
made
a
the
favor
would
be
enormous
only
to
be
granted
to
vast
wealth
or
conspicuous
services
or
very
powerful
influence
the
young
man
looks
like
a
shopman
in
his
sunday
suit
evidently
he
is
neither
wealthy
nor
noble
he
has
a
fine
head
but
he
seems
to
me
to
be
very
silly
he
has
no
idea
what
to
do
and
has
nothing
to
say
for
himself
in
fact
he
has
no
breeding
how
came
you
to
take
him
up
mme
de
bargeton
renounced
lucien
as
lucien
himself
had
renounced
her
a
ghastly
fear
lest
her
cousin
should
learn
the
manner
of
her
journey
shot
through
her
mind
dear
cousin
i
am
in
despair
that
i
have
compromised
people
do
not
compromise
me
mme
d
espard
said
smiling
i
am
only
thinking
of
but
you
have
asked
him
to
dine
with
you
on
i
shall
be
ill
the
marquise
said
quickly
you
can
tell
him
so
and
i
shall
leave
orders
that
he
is
not
to
be
admitted
under
either
during
the
interval
lucien
noticed
that
every
one
was
walking
up
and
down
the
lobby
he
would
do
the
same
in
the
first
place
not
one
of
mme
d
espard
s
visitors
recognized
him
nor
paid
any
attention
to
him
their
conduct
seemed
nothing
less
than
extraordinary
to
the
provincial
poet
and
secondly
chatelet
on
whom
he
tried
to
hang
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
fought
shy
of
him
lucien
walked
to
and
fro
watching
the
eddying
crowd
of
men
till
he
felt
convinced
that
his
costume
was
absurd
and
he
went
back
to
his
box
ensconced
himself
in
a
corner
and
stayed
there
till
the
end
at
times
he
thought
of
nothing
but
the
magnificent
spectacle
of
the
ballet
in
the
great
inferno
scene
in
the
fifth
act
sometimes
the
sight
of
the
house
absorbed
him
sometimes
his
own
thoughts
he
had
seen
society
in
paris
and
the
sight
had
stirred
him
to
the
depths
so
this
is
my
kingdom
he
said
to
himself
this
is
the
world
that
i
must
as
he
walked
home
through
the
streets
he
thought
over
all
that
had
been
said
by
mme
d
espard
s
courtiers
memory
reproducing
with
strange
faithfulness
their
demeanor
their
gestures
their
manner
of
coming
and
going
next
day
towards
noon
lucien
betook
himself
to
staub
the
great
tailor
of
that
day
partly
by
dint
of
entreaties
and
partly
by
virtue
of
cash
lucien
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
promise
that
his
clothes
should
be
ready
in
time
for
the
great
day
staub
went
so
far
as
to
give
his
word
that
a
perfectly
elegant
coat
a
waistcoat
and
a
pair
of
trousers
should
be
forthcoming
lucien
then
ordered
linen
and
a
little
outfit
in
short
of
a
and
a
celebrated
bootmaker
measured
him
for
shoes
and
boots
he
bought
a
neat
walking
cane
at
verdier
s
he
went
to
mme
irlande
for
gloves
and
shirt
studs
in
short
he
did
his
best
to
reach
the
climax
of
dandyism
when
he
had
satisfied
all
his
fancies
he
went
to
the
rue
and
found
that
louise
had
gone
out
she
was
dining
with
mme
la
marquise
d
espard
her
maid
said
and
would
not
be
back
till
lucien
dined
for
two
francs
at
a
restaurant
in
the
palais
royal
and
went
to
bed
early
the
next
day
was
sunday
he
went
to
louise
s
lodging
at
eleven
o
clock
louise
had
not
yet
risen
at
two
o
clock
he
returned
once
more
madame
can
not
see
anybody
yet
reported
albertine
but
she
gave
me
a
line
for
can
not
see
anybody
yet
repeated
lucien
but
i
am
not
anybody
i
do
not
know
albertine
answered
very
impertinently
and
lucien
less
surprised
by
albertine
s
answer
than
by
a
note
from
mme
de
bargeton
took
the
billet
and
read
the
following
discouraging
lines
mme
d
espard
is
not
well
she
will
not
be
able
to
see
you
on
monday
i
am
not
feeling
very
well
myself
but
i
am
about
to
dress
and
go
to
keep
her
company
i
am
in
despair
over
this
little
disappointment
but
your
talents
reassure
me
you
will
make
your
way
without
and
no
signature
lucien
said
to
himself
he
found
himself
in
the
tuileries
before
he
knew
whither
he
was
walking
with
the
gift
of
which
accompanies
genius
he
began
to
suspect
that
the
chilly
note
was
but
a
warning
of
the
catastrophe
to
come
lost
in
thought
he
walked
on
and
on
gazing
at
the
monuments
in
the
place
louis
quinze
it
was
a
sunny
day
a
stream
of
fine
carriages
went
past
him
on
the
way
to
the
champs
elysees
following
the
direction
of
the
crowd
of
strollers
he
saw
the
three
or
four
thousand
carriages
that
turn
the
champs
elysees
into
an
improvised
longchamp
on
sunday
afternoons
in
summer
the
splendid
horses
the
toilettes
and
liveries
bewildered
him
he
went
further
and
further
until
he
reached
the
arc
de
triomphe
then
unfinished
what
were
his
feelings
when
as
he
returned
he
saw
mme
de
bargeton
and
mme
d
espard
coming
towards
him
in
a
wonderfully
appointed
caleche
with
a
chasseur
behind
it
in
waving
plumes
and
that
green
uniform
which
he
knew
only
too
well
there
was
a
block
somewhere
in
the
row
and
the
carriages
waited
lucien
beheld
louise
transformed
beyond
recognition
all
the
colors
of
her
toilette
had
been
carefully
subordinated
to
her
complexion
her
dress
was
delicious
her
hair
gracefully
and
becomingly
arranged
her
hat
in
exquisite
taste
was
remarkable
even
beside
mme
d
espard
that
leader
of
fashion
there
is
something
in
the
art
of
wearing
a
hat
that
escapes
definition
tilted
too
far
to
the
back
of
the
head
it
imparts
a
bold
expression
to
the
face
bring
it
too
far
forward
it
gives
you
a
sinister
look
tipped
to
one
side
it
has
a
jaunty
air
a
woman
wears
her
hat
exactly
as
she
means
to
wear
it
and
exactly
at
the
right
angle
mme
de
bargeton
had
solved
this
curious
problem
at
sight
a
dainty
girdle
outlined
her
slender
waist
she
had
adopted
her
cousin
s
gestures
and
tricks
of
manner
and
now
as
she
sat
by
mme
d
espard
s
side
she
played
with
a
tiny
scent
bottle
that
dangled
by
a
slender
gold
chain
from
one
of
her
fingers
displayed
a
little
hand
without
seeming
to
do
so
she
had
modeled
herself
on
mme
d
espard
without
mimicking
her
the
marquise
had
found
a
cousin
worthy
of
her
and
seemed
to
be
proud
of
her
pupil
the
men
and
women
on
the
footways
all
gazed
at
the
splendid
carriage
with
the
bearings
of
the
d
espards
and
upon
the
panels
lucien
was
amazed
at
the
number
of
greetings
received
by
the
cousins
he
did
not
know
that
the
all
paris
which
consists
in
some
score
of
salons
was
well
aware
already
of
the
relationship
between
the
ladies
a
little
group
of
young
men
on
horseback
accompanied
the
carriage
in
the
bois
lucien
could
recognize
de
marsay
and
rastignac
among
them
and
could
see
from
their
gestures
that
the
pair
of
coxcombs
were
complimenting
mme
de
bargeton
upon
her
transformation
mme
d
espard
was
radiant
with
health
and
grace
so
her
indisposition
was
simply
a
pretext
for
ridding
herself
of
him
for
there
had
been
no
mention
of
another
day
the
wrathful
poet
went
towards
the
caleche
he
walked
slowly
waited
till
he
came
in
full
sight
of
the
two
ladies
and
made
them
a
bow
mme
de
bargeton
would
not
see
him
but
the
marquise
put
up
her
eyeglass
and
deliberately
cut
him
he
had
been
disowned
by
the
sovereign
lords
of
angouleme
but
to
be
disowned
by
society
in
paris
was
another
thing
the
by
doing
their
utmost
to
mortify
lucien
admitted
his
power
and
acknowledged
him
as
a
man
for
mme
d
espard
he
had
positively
no
existence
this
was
a
sentence
it
was
a
refusal
of
justice
poor
poet
a
deadly
cold
seized
on
him
when
he
saw
de
marsay
eying
him
through
his
glass
and
when
the
parisian
lion
let
that
optical
instrument
fall
it
dropped
in
so
singular
a
fashion
that
lucien
thought
of
the
of
the
guillotine
the
caleche
went
by
rage
and
a
craving
for
vengeance
took
possession
of
his
slighted
soul
if
mme
de
bargeton
had
been
in
his
power
he
could
have
cut
her
throat
at
that
moment
he
was
a
gloating
over
the
pleasure
of
sending
mme
d
espard
to
the
scaffold
if
only
he
could
have
put
de
marsay
to
the
torture
with
refinements
of
savage
cruelty
canalis
went
by
on
horseback
bowing
to
the
prettiest
women
his
dress
elegant
as
became
the
most
dainty
of
poets
great
heavens
exclaimed
lucien
money
money
at
all
costs
money
is
the
one
power
before
which
the
world
bends
the
no
cried
conscience
not
money
but
glory
and
glory
means
work
work
that
was
what
david
great
heavens
what
am
i
doing
here
but
i
will
triumph
i
will
drive
along
this
avenue
in
a
caleche
with
a
chasseur
behind
me
i
will
possess
a
marquise
d
and
flinging
out
the
wrathful
words
he
went
to
hurbain
s
to
dine
for
two
francs
next
morning
at
nine
o
clock
he
went
to
the
rue
to
upbraid
louise
for
her
barbarity
but
mme
de
bargeton
was
not
at
home
to
him
and
not
only
so
but
the
porter
would
not
allow
him
to
go
up
to
her
rooms
so
he
stayed
outside
in
the
street
watching
the
house
till
noon
at
twelve
o
clock
chatelet
came
out
looked
at
lucien
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
avoided
him
stung
to
the
quick
lucien
hurried
after
his
rival
and
chatelet
finding
himself
closely
pursued
turned
and
bowed
evidently
intending
to
shake
him
off
by
this
courtesy
spare
me
just
a
moment
for
pity
s
sake
sir
said
lucien
i
want
just
a
word
or
two
with
you
you
have
shown
me
friendship
i
now
ask
the
most
trifling
service
of
that
friendship
you
have
just
come
from
mme
de
bargeton
how
have
i
fallen
into
disgrace
with
her
and
mme
d
espard
please
m
chardon
do
you
know
why
the
ladies
left
you
at
the
opera
that
evening
asked
chatelet
with
treacherous
no
said
the
poor
poet
well
it
was
de
rastignac
who
spoke
against
you
from
the
beginning
they
asked
him
about
you
and
the
young
dandy
simply
said
that
your
name
was
chardon
and
not
de
rubempre
that
your
mother
was
a
monthly
nurse
that
your
father
when
he
was
alive
was
an
apothecary
in
l
houmeau
a
suburb
of
angouleme
and
that
your
sister
a
charming
girl
gets
up
shirts
to
admiration
and
is
just
about
to
be
married
to
a
local
printer
named
sechard
such
is
the
world
you
no
sooner
show
yourself
than
it
pulls
you
to
pieces
m
de
marsay
came
to
mme
d
espard
to
laugh
at
you
with
her
so
the
two
ladies
thinking
that
your
presence
put
them
in
a
false
position
went
out
at
once
do
not
attempt
to
go
to
either
house
if
mme
de
bargeton
continued
to
receive
your
visits
her
cousin
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
you
have
genius
try
to
avenge
yourself
the
world
looks
down
upon
you
look
down
in
your
turn
upon
the
world
take
refuge
in
some
garret
write
your
masterpieces
seize
on
power
of
any
kind
and
you
will
see
the
world
at
your
feet
then
you
can
give
back
the
bruises
which
you
have
received
and
in
the
very
place
where
they
were
given
mme
de
bargeton
will
be
the
more
distant
now
because
she
has
been
friendly
that
is
the
way
with
women
but
the
question
now
for
you
is
not
how
to
win
back
anais
friendship
but
how
to
avoid
making
an
enemy
of
her
i
will
tell
you
of
a
way
she
has
written
letters
to
you
send
all
her
letters
back
to
her
she
will
be
sensible
that
you
are
acting
like
a
gentleman
and
at
a
later
time
if
you
should
need
her
she
will
not
be
hostile
for
my
own
part
i
have
so
high
an
opinion
of
your
future
that
i
have
taken
your
part
everywhere
and
if
i
can
do
anything
here
for
you
you
will
always
find
me
ready
to
be
of
the
elderly
beau
seemed
to
have
grown
young
again
in
the
atmosphere
of
paris
he
bowed
with
frigid
politeness
but
lucien
haggard
and
undone
forgot
to
return
the
salutation
he
went
back
to
his
inn
and
there
found
the
great
staub
himself
come
in
person
not
so
much
to
try
his
customer
s
clothes
as
to
make
inquiries
of
the
landlady
with
regard
to
that
customer
s
financial
status
the
report
had
been
satisfactory
lucien
had
traveled
post
mme
de
bargeton
brought
him
back
from
vaudeville
last
thursday
in
her
carriage
staub
addressed
lucien
as
monsieur
le
comte
and
called
his
customer
s
attention
to
the
artistic
skill
with
which
he
had
brought
a
charming
figure
into
relief
a
young
man
in
such
a
costume
has
only
to
walk
in
the
tuileries
he
said
and
he
will
marry
an
english
heiress
within
a
lucien
brightened
a
little
under
the
influences
of
the
german
tailor
s
joke
the
perfect
fit
of
his
new
clothes
the
fine
cloth
and
the
sight
of
a
graceful
figure
which
met
his
eyes
in
the
vaguely
he
told
himself
that
paris
was
the
capital
of
chance
and
for
the
moment
he
believed
in
chance
had
he
not
a
volume
of
poems
and
a
magnificent
romance
entitled
archer
of
charles
in
manuscript
he
had
hope
for
the
future
staub
promised
the
overcoat
and
the
rest
of
the
clothes
the
next
day
the
next
day
the
bootmaker
and
tailor
all
returned
armed
each
with
his
bill
which
lucien
still
under
the
charm
of
provincial
habits
paid
forthwith
not
knowing
how
otherwise
to
rid
himself
of
them
after
he
had
paid
there
remained
but
three
hundred
and
sixty
francs
out
of
the
two
thousand
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
angouleme
and
he
had
been
but
one
week
in
paris
nevertheless
he
dressed
and
went
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
terrassee
des
feuillants
he
had
his
day
of
triumph
he
looked
so
handsome
and
so
graceful
he
was
so
well
dressed
that
women
looked
at
him
two
or
three
were
so
much
struck
with
his
beauty
that
they
turned
their
heads
to
look
again
lucien
studied
the
gait
and
carriage
of
the
young
men
on
the
terrasse
and
took
a
lesson
in
fine
manners
while
he
meditated
on
his
three
hundred
and
sixty
francs
that
evening
alone
in
his
chamber
an
idea
occurred
to
him
which
threw
a
light
on
the
problem
of
his
existence
at
the
where
he
lived
on
the
plainest
fare
thinking
to
economize
in
this
way
he
asked
for
his
account
as
if
he
meant
to
leave
and
discovered
that
he
was
indebted
to
his
landlord
to
the
extent
of
a
hundred
francs
the
next
morning
was
spent
in
running
around
the
latin
quarter
recommended
for
its
cheapness
by
david
for
a
long
while
he
looked
about
till
finally
in
the
rue
de
cluny
close
to
the
sorbonne
he
discovered
a
place
where
he
could
have
a
furnished
room
for
such
a
price
as
he
could
afford
to
pay
he
settled
with
his
hostess
of
the
and
took
up
his
quarters
in
the
rue
de
cluny
that
same
day
his
removal
only
cost
him
the
cab
fare
when
he
had
taken
possession
of
his
poor
room
he
made
a
packet
of
mme
de
bargeton
s
letters
laid
them
on
the
table
and
sat
down
to
write
to
her
but
before
he
wrote
he
fell
to
thinking
over
that
fatal
week
he
did
not
tell
himself
that
he
had
been
the
first
to
be
faithless
that
for
a
sudden
fancy
he
had
been
ready
to
leave
his
louise
without
knowing
what
would
become
of
her
in
paris
he
saw
none
of
his
own
shortcomings
but
he
saw
his
present
position
and
blamed
mme
de
bargeton
for
it
she
was
to
have
lighted
his
way
instead
she
had
ruined
him
he
grew
indignant
he
grew
proud
he
worked
himself
into
a
paroxysm
of
rage
and
set
himself
to
compose
the
following
epistle
what
would
you
think
madame
of
a
woman
who
should
take
a
fancy
to
some
poor
and
timid
child
full
of
the
noble
superstitions
which
the
grown
man
calls
illusions
and
using
all
the
charms
of
woman
s
coquetry
all
her
most
delicate
ingenuity
should
feign
a
mother
s
love
to
lead
that
child
astray
her
fondest
promises
the
which
raised
his
wonder
cost
her
nothing
she
leads
him
on
tightens
her
hold
upon
him
sometimes
coaxing
sometimes
scolding
him
for
his
want
of
confidence
till
the
child
leaves
his
home
and
follows
her
blindly
to
the
shores
of
a
vast
sea
smiling
she
lures
him
into
a
frail
skiff
and
sends
him
forth
alone
and
helpless
to
face
the
storm
standing
safe
on
the
rock
she
laughs
and
wishes
him
luck
you
are
that
woman
i
am
that
child
the
child
has
a
keepsake
in
his
hands
something
which
might
betray
the
wrongs
done
by
your
beneficence
your
kindness
in
deserting
him
you
might
have
to
blush
if
you
saw
him
struggling
for
life
and
chanced
to
recollect
that
once
you
clasped
him
to
your
breast
when
you
read
these
words
the
keepsake
will
be
in
your
own
safe
keeping
you
are
free
to
forget
everything
once
you
pointed
out
fair
hopes
to
me
in
the
skies
i
awake
to
find
reality
in
the
squalid
poverty
of
paris
while
you
pass
and
others
bow
before
you
on
your
brilliant
path
in
the
great
world
i
i
whom
you
deserted
on
the
threshold
shall
be
shivering
in
the
wretched
garret
to
which
you
consigned
me
yet
some
pang
may
perhaps
trouble
your
mind
amid
festivals
and
pleasures
you
may
think
sometimes
of
the
child
whom
you
thrust
into
the
depths
if
so
madame
think
of
him
without
remorse
out
of
the
depths
of
his
misery
the
child
offers
you
the
one
thing
left
to
him
his
forgiveness
in
a
last
look
yes
madame
thanks
to
you
i
have
nothing
left
nothing
was
not
the
world
created
from
nothing
genius
should
follow
the
divine
example
i
begin
with
forgiveness
but
as
yet
i
know
not
whether
i
possess
the
power
you
need
only
tremble
lest
i
should
go
astray
for
you
would
be
answerable
for
my
sins
alas
i
pity
you
for
you
will
have
no
part
in
the
future
towards
which
i
go
with
work
as
my
after
penning
this
rhetorical
effusion
full
of
the
sombre
dignity
which
an
artist
of
is
rather
apt
to
overdo
lucien
s
thoughts
went
back
to
them
at
home
he
saw
the
pretty
rooms
which
david
had
furnished
for
him
at
the
cost
of
part
of
his
little
store
and
a
vision
rose
before
him
of
quiet
simple
pleasures
in
the
past
shadowy
figures
came
about
him
he
saw
his
mother
and
eve
and
david
and
heard
their
sobs
over
his
and
at
that
he
began
to
cry
himself
for
he
felt
very
lonely
in
paris
and
friendless
and
forlorn
two
or
three
days
later
he
wrote
to
his
sister
my
dear
eve
when
a
sister
shares
the
life
of
a
brother
who
devotes
himself
to
art
it
is
her
sad
privilege
to
take
more
sorrow
than
joy
into
her
life
and
i
am
beginning
to
fear
that
i
shall
be
a
great
trouble
to
you
have
i
not
abused
your
goodness
already
have
not
all
of
you
sacrificed
yourselves
to
me
it
is
the
memory
of
the
past
so
full
of
family
happiness
that
helps
me
to
bear
up
in
my
present
loneliness
now
that
i
have
tasted
the
first
beginnings
of
poverty
and
the
treachery
of
the
world
of
paris
how
my
thoughts
have
flown
to
you
swift
as
an
eagle
back
to
its
eyrie
so
that
i
might
be
with
true
affection
again
did
you
see
sparks
in
the
candle
did
a
coal
pop
out
of
the
fire
did
you
hear
singing
in
your
ears
and
did
mother
say
lucien
is
thinking
of
us
and
david
answer
he
is
fighting
his
way
in
the
world
my
eve
i
am
writing
this
letter
for
your
eyes
only
i
can
not
tell
any
one
else
all
that
has
happened
to
me
good
and
bad
blushing
for
both
as
i
write
for
good
here
is
as
rare
as
evil
ought
to
be
you
shall
have
a
great
piece
of
news
in
a
very
few
words
mme
de
bargeton
was
ashamed
of
me
disowned
me
would
not
see
me
and
gave
me
up
nine
days
after
we
came
to
paris
she
saw
me
in
the
street
and
looked
another
way
when
simply
to
follow
her
into
the
society
to
which
she
meant
to
introduce
me
i
had
spent
seventeen
hundred
and
sixty
francs
out
of
the
two
thousand
i
brought
from
angouleme
the
money
so
hardly
scraped
together
how
did
you
spend
it
you
will
ask
paris
is
a
strange
bottomless
gulf
my
poor
sister
you
can
dine
here
for
less
than
a
franc
yet
the
simplest
dinner
at
a
fashionable
restaurant
costs
fifty
francs
there
are
waistcoats
and
trousers
to
be
had
for
four
francs
and
two
francs
each
but
a
fashionable
tailor
never
charges
less
than
a
hundred
francs
you
pay
for
everything
you
pay
a
halfpenny
to
cross
the
kennel
in
the
street
when
it
rains
you
can
not
go
the
least
little
way
in
a
cab
for
less
than
sous
i
have
been
staying
in
one
of
the
best
parts
of
paris
but
now
i
am
living
at
the
hotel
de
cluny
in
the
rue
de
cluny
one
of
the
poorest
and
darkest
slums
shut
in
between
three
churches
and
the
old
buildings
of
the
sorbonne
i
have
a
furnished
room
on
the
fourth
floor
it
is
very
bare
and
very
dirty
but
all
the
same
i
pay
fifteen
francs
a
month
for
it
for
breakfast
i
spend
a
penny
on
a
roll
and
a
halfpenny
for
milk
but
i
dine
very
decently
for
sous
at
a
restaurant
kept
by
a
man
named
flicoteaux
in
the
place
de
la
sorbonne
itself
my
expenses
every
month
will
not
exceed
sixty
francs
everything
included
until
the
winter
begins
at
least
i
hope
not
so
my
two
hundred
and
forty
francs
ought
to
last
me
for
the
first
four
months
between
now
and
then
i
shall
have
sold
archer
of
charles
and
the
no
doubt
do
not
be
in
the
least
uneasy
on
my
account
if
the
present
is
cold
and
bare
and
the
blue
distant
future
is
rich
and
splendid
most
great
men
have
known
the
vicissitudes
which
depress
but
can
not
overwhelm
me
plautus
the
great
comic
latin
poet
was
once
a
miller
s
lad
machiavelli
wrote
at
night
and
by
day
was
a
common
like
any
one
else
and
more
than
all
the
great
cervantes
who
lost
an
arm
at
the
battle
of
lepanto
and
helped
to
win
that
famous
day
was
called
a
handless
dotard
by
the
scribblers
of
his
day
there
was
an
interval
of
ten
years
between
the
appearance
of
the
first
part
and
the
second
of
his
sublime
for
lack
of
a
publisher
things
are
not
so
bad
as
that
nowadays
mortifications
and
want
only
fall
to
the
lot
of
unknown
writers
as
soon
as
a
man
s
name
is
known
he
grows
rich
and
i
will
be
rich
and
besides
i
live
within
myself
i
spend
half
the
day
at
the
bibliotheque
learning
all
that
i
want
to
learn
i
should
not
go
far
unless
i
knew
more
than
i
do
so
at
this
moment
i
am
almost
happy
in
a
few
days
i
have
fallen
in
with
my
life
very
gladly
i
begin
the
work
that
i
love
with
daylight
my
subsistence
is
secure
i
think
a
great
deal
and
i
study
i
do
not
see
that
i
am
open
to
attack
at
any
point
now
that
i
have
renounced
a
world
where
my
vanity
might
suffer
at
any
moment
the
great
men
of
every
age
are
obliged
to
lead
lives
apart
what
are
they
but
birds
in
the
forest
they
sing
nature
falls
under
the
spell
of
their
song
and
no
one
should
see
them
that
shall
be
my
lot
always
supposing
that
i
can
carry
out
my
ambitious
plans
mme
de
bargeton
i
do
not
regret
a
woman
who
could
behave
as
she
behaved
does
not
deserve
a
thought
nor
am
i
sorry
that
i
left
angouleme
she
did
wisely
when
she
flung
me
into
the
sea
of
paris
to
sink
or
swim
this
is
the
place
for
men
of
letters
and
thinkers
and
poets
here
you
cultivate
glory
and
i
know
how
fair
the
harvest
is
that
we
reap
in
these
days
nowhere
else
can
a
writer
find
the
living
works
of
the
great
dead
the
works
of
art
which
quicken
the
imagination
in
the
galleries
and
museums
here
nowhere
else
will
you
find
great
reference
libraries
always
open
in
which
the
intellect
may
find
pasture
and
lastly
here
in
paris
there
is
a
spirit
which
you
breathe
in
the
air
it
infuses
the
least
details
every
literary
creation
bears
traces
of
its
influence
you
learn
more
by
talk
in
a
cafe
or
at
a
theatre
in
one
half
hour
than
you
would
learn
in
ten
years
in
the
provinces
here
in
truth
wherever
you
go
there
is
always
something
to
see
something
to
learn
some
comparison
to
make
extreme
cheapness
and
excessive
dearness
there
is
paris
for
you
there
is
honeycomb
here
for
every
bee
every
nature
finds
its
own
nourishment
so
though
life
is
hard
for
me
just
now
i
repent
of
nothing
on
the
contrary
a
fair
future
spreads
out
before
me
and
my
heart
rejoices
though
it
is
saddened
for
the
moment
my
dear
sister
do
not
expect
letters
from
me
regularly
it
is
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
paris
that
one
really
does
not
know
how
the
time
goes
life
is
so
alarmingly
rapid
i
kiss
the
mother
and
you
and
david
more
tenderly
than
ever
the
name
of
flicoteaux
is
engraved
on
many
memories
few
indeed
were
the
students
who
lived
in
the
latin
quarter
during
the
last
twelve
years
of
the
restoration
and
did
not
frequent
that
temple
sacred
to
hunger
and
impecuniosity
there
a
dinner
of
three
courses
with
a
quarter
bottle
of
wine
or
a
bottle
of
beer
could
be
had
for
eighteen
sous
or
for
sous
the
quarter
bottle
becomes
a
bottle
flicoteaux
that
friend
of
youth
would
beyond
a
doubt
have
amassed
a
colossal
fortune
but
for
a
line
on
his
bill
of
fare
a
line
which
rival
establishments
are
wont
to
print
in
capital
letters
thus
bread
at
discretion
which
being
interpreted
should
read
flicoteaux
has
been
to
many
an
illustrious
name
verily
the
heart
of
more
than
one
great
man
ought
to
wax
warm
with
innumerable
recollections
of
inexpressible
enjoyment
at
the
sight
of
the
small
square
window
panes
that
look
upon
the
place
de
la
sorbonne
and
the
rue
flicoteaux
ii
and
flicoteaux
iii
respected
the
old
exterior
maintaining
the
dingy
hue
and
general
air
of
a
respectable
house
showing
thereby
the
depth
of
their
contempt
for
the
charlatanism
of
the
the
kind
of
advertisement
which
feasts
the
eyes
at
the
expense
of
the
stomach
to
which
your
modern
restaurant
almost
always
has
recourse
here
you
beheld
no
piles
of
game
never
destined
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
spit
no
fantastical
fish
to
justify
the
mountebank
s
remark
i
saw
a
fine
carp
i
expect
to
buy
it
this
day
instead
of
the
prime
vegetables
more
fittingly
described
by
the
word
primeval
artfully
displayed
in
the
window
for
the
delectation
of
the
military
man
and
his
fellow
the
nursemaid
honest
flicoteaux
exhibited
full
adorned
with
many
a
rivet
or
pyramids
of
stewed
prunes
to
rejoice
the
sight
of
the
customer
and
assure
him
that
the
word
dessert
with
which
other
handbills
made
too
free
was
in
this
case
no
charter
to
hoodwink
the
public
loaves
of
six
pounds
weight
cut
in
four
quarters
made
good
the
promise
of
bread
at
such
was
the
plenty
of
the
establishment
that
moliere
would
have
celebrated
it
if
it
had
been
in
existence
in
his
day
so
comically
appropriate
is
the
name
flicoteaux
still
subsists
so
long
as
students
are
minded
to
live
flicoteaux
will
make
a
living
you
feed
there
neither
more
nor
less
and
you
feed
as
you
work
with
morose
or
cheerful
industry
according
to
the
circumstances
and
the
temperament
at
that
time
his
establishment
consisted
of
two
at
right
angles
to
each
other
long
narrow
rooms
looking
respectively
on
the
rue
and
the
place
de
la
sorbonne
the
furniture
must
have
come
originally
from
the
refectory
of
some
abbey
for
there
was
a
monastic
look
about
the
lengthy
tables
where
the
serviettes
of
regular
customers
each
thrust
through
a
numbered
ring
of
crystallized
tin
plate
were
laid
by
their
places
flicoteaux
only
changed
the
serviettes
of
a
sunday
but
flicoteaux
ii
changed
them
twice
a
week
it
is
said
under
pressure
of
competition
which
threatened
his
dynasty
flicoteaux
s
restaurant
is
no
with
its
refinements
and
luxuries
it
is
a
workshop
where
suitable
tools
are
provided
and
everybody
gets
up
and
goes
as
soon
as
he
has
finished
the
coming
and
going
within
are
swift
there
is
no
dawdling
among
the
waiters
they
are
all
busy
every
one
of
them
is
wanted
the
fare
is
not
very
varied
the
potato
is
a
permanent
institution
there
might
not
be
a
single
tuber
left
in
ireland
and
prevailing
dearth
elsewhere
but
you
would
still
find
potatoes
at
flicoteaux
s
not
once
in
thirty
years
shall
you
miss
its
pale
gold
the
color
beloved
of
titian
sprinkled
with
chopped
verdure
the
potato
enjoys
a
privilege
that
women
might
envy
such
as
you

it
in

shall
you
find
it
in

and

of

are
not
on
the
regular

must
be
ordered
beforehand
beef

the
feminine
gender

prevails
the
young
of
the

in
all
kinds
of
ingenious
disguises
when
the
whiting
and
mackerel
abound
on
our
shores
they
are
likewise
seen
in
large
numbers
at
flicoteaux
s
his
whole
establishment
indeed
is
directly
affected
by
the
caprices
of
the
season
and
the
vicissitudes
of
french
agriculture
by
eating
your
dinners
at
flicoteaux
s
you
learn
a
host
of
things
of
which
the
wealthy
the
idle
and
folk
indifferent
to
the
phases
of
nature
have
no
suspicion
and
the
student
penned
up
in
the
latin
quarter
is
kept
accurately
informed
of
the
state
of
the
weather
and
good
or
bad
seasons
he
knows
when
it
is
a
good
year
for
peas
or
french
beans
and
the
kind
of
salad

that
is
plentiful
when
the
great
market
is
glutted
with
cabbages
he
is
at
once
aware
of
the
fact
and
the
failure
of
the
beetroot
crop
is
brought
home
to
his
mind
a
slander
old
in
circulation
in
lucien
s
time
connected
the
appearance
of
with
a
mortality
among
horseflesh

restaurants
are
so
well
worth
seeing

one
at

s
is
young
you
see
nothing
but
youth
and
although
earnest
faces
and
grave
gloomy
anxious
faces
are
not
lacking
you
see
hope
and
confidence
and
poverty
gaily
endured
dress
as
a
rule

careless
and
regular
comers
in
decent
clothes
are
marked
exceptions
everybody
knows
at
once
that
something
extraordinary
is
afoot
a
mistress
to
visit
a
theatre
party
or
some
excursion
into
higher
spheres
here
it
is
said
friendships
have
been
made
among
students
who
became
famous
men
in
after
days
as
will
be
seen
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
but
with
the
exception
of
a
few
knots
of
young
fellows
from
the
same
part
of
france
who
make
a
group
about
the
end
of
a
table
the
gravity
of
the
diners
is
hardly
relaxed
perhaps
this
gravity
is
due
to
the
catholicity
of
the
wine
which
checks
good
fellowship
of
any
kind
flicoteaux
s
frequenters
may
recollect
certain
sombre
and
mysterious
figures
enveloped
in
the
gloom
of
the
chilliest
penury
these
beings
would
dine
there
daily
for
a
couple
of
years
and
then
vanish
and
the
most
inquisitive
regular
comer
could
throw
no
light
on
the
disappearance
of
such
goblins
of
paris
friendships
struck
up
over
flicoteaux
s
dinners
were
sealed
in
neighboring
cafes
in
the
flames
of
heady
punch
or
by
the
generous
warmth
of
a
small
cup
of
black
coffee
glorified
by
a
dash
of
something
hotter
and
stronger
lucien
like
all
neophytes
was
modest
and
regular
in
his
habits
in
those
early
days
at
the
hotel
de
cluny
after
the
first
unlucky
venture
in
fashionable
life
which
absorbed
his
capital
he
threw
himself
into
his
work
with
the
first
earnest
enthusiasm
which
is
frittered
away
so
soon
over
the
difficulties
or
in
the
of
every
life
in
paris
the
most
luxurious
and
the
very
poorest
lives
are
equally
beset
with
temptations
which
nothing
but
the
fierce
energy
of
genius
or
the
morose
persistence
of
ambition
can
overcome
lucien
used
to
drop
in
at
flicoteaux
s
about
four
having
remarked
the
advantages
of
an
early
arrival
the
was
more
varied
and
there
was
still
some
chance
of
obtaining
the
dish
of
your
choice
like
all
imaginative
persons
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
a
particular
seat
and
showed
discrimination
in
his
selection
on
the
very
first
day
he
had
noticed
a
table
near
the
counter
and
from
the
faces
of
those
who
sat
about
it
and
chance
snatches
of
their
talk
he
recognized
brothers
of
the
craft
a
sort
of
instinct
moreover
pointed
out
the
table
near
the
counter
as
a
spot
whence
he
could
parlay
with
the
owners
of
the
restaurant
in
time
an
acquaintance
would
grow
up
he
thought
and
then
in
the
day
of
distress
he
could
no
doubt
obtain
the
necessary
credit
so
he
took
his
place
at
a
small
square
table
close
to
the
desk
intended
probably
for
casual
comers
for
the
two
clean
serviettes
were
unadorned
with
rings
lucien
s
opposite
neighbor
was
a
thin
pallid
youth
to
all
appearance
as
poor
as
himself
his
handsome
face
was
somewhat
worn
already
it
told
of
hopes
that
had
vanished
leaving
lines
upon
his
forehead
and
barren
furrows
in
his
soul
where
seeds
had
been
sown
that
had
come
to
nothing
lucien
felt
drawn
to
the
stranger
by
these
tokens
his
sympathies
went
out
to
him
with
irresistible
fervor
after
a
week
s
exchange
of
small
courtesies
and
remarks
the
poet
from
angouleme
found
the
first
person
with
whom
he
could
chat
the
stranger
s
name
was
etienne
lousteau
two
years
ago
he
had
left
his
native
place
a
town
in
berri
just
as
lucien
had
come
from
angouleme
his
lively
gestures
bright
eyes
and
occasionally
curt
speech
revealed
a
bitter
apprenticeship
to
literature
etienne
had
come
from
sancerre
with
his
tragedy
in
his
pocket
drawn
to
paris
by
the
same
motives
that
impelled
lucien
hope
of
fame
and
power
and
money
sometimes
etienne
lousteau
came
for
several
days
together
but
in
a
little
while
his
visits
became
few
and
far
between
and
he
would
stay
away
for
five
or
six
days
in
succession
then
he
would
come
back
and
lucien
would
hope
to
see
his
poet
next
day
only
to
find
a
stranger
in
his
place
when
two
young
men
meet
daily
their
talk
harks
back
to
their
last
conversation
but
these
continual
interruptions
obliged
lucien
to
break
the
ice
afresh
each
time
and
further
checked
an
intimacy
which
made
little
progress
during
the
first
few
weeks
on
inquiry
of
the
damsel
at
the
counter
lucien
was
told
that
his
future
friend
was
on
the
staff
of
a
small
newspaper
and
wrote
reviews
of
books
and
dramatic
criticism
of
pieces
played
at
the
the
gaite
and
the
the
young
man
became
a
personage
all
at
once
in
lucien
s
eyes
now
he
thought
he
would
lead
the
conversation
on
rather
more
personal
topics
and
make
some
effort
to
gain
a
friend
so
likely
to
be
useful
to
a
beginner
the
journalist
stayed
away
for
a
fortnight
lucien
did
not
know
that
etienne
only
dined
at
flicoteaux
s
when
he
was
hard
up
and
hence
his
gloomy
air
of
disenchantment
and
the
chilly
manner
which
lucien
met
with
gracious
smiles
and
amiable
remarks
but
after
all
the
project
of
a
friendship
called
for
mature
deliberation
this
obscure
journalist
appeared
to
lead
an
expensive
life
in
which
cups
of
coffee
and
suppers
played
a
part
in
the
early
days
of
lucien
s
life
in
the
latin
quarter
he
behaved
like
a
poor
child
bewildered
by
his
first
experience
of
paris
life
so
that
when
he
had
made
a
study
of
prices
and
weighed
his
purse
he
lacked
courage
to
make
advances
to
etienne
he
was
afraid
of
beginning
a
fresh
series
of
blunders
of
which
he
was
still
repenting
and
he
was
still
under
the
yoke
of
provincial
creeds
his
two
guardian
angels
eve
and
david
rose
up
before
him
at
the
least
approach
of
an
evil
thought
putting
him
in
mind
of
all
the
hopes
that
were
centered
on
him
of
the
happiness
that
he
owed
to
the
old
mother
of
all
the
promises
of
his
genius
he
spent
his
mornings
in
studying
history
at
the
bibliotheque
his
very
first
researches
made
him
aware
of
frightful
errors
in
the
memoirs
of
archer
of
charles
when
the
library
closed
he
went
back
to
his
damp
chilly
room
to
correct
his
work
cutting
out
whole
chapters
and
piecing
it
together
anew
and
after
dining
at
flicoteaux
s
he
went
down
to
the
passage
du
commerce
to
see
the
newspapers
at
blosse
s
as
well
as
new
books
and
magazines
and
poetry
so
as
to
keep
himself
informed
of
the
movements
of
the
day
and
when
towards
midnight
he
returned
to
his
wretched
lodgings
he
had
used
neither
fuel
nor
his
reading
in
those
days
made
such
an
enormous
change
in
his
ideas
that
he
revised
the
volume
of
his
beloved
working
them
over
to
such
purpose
that
scarce
a
hundred
lines
of
the
original
verses
were
allowed
to
stand
so
in
the
beginning
lucien
led
the
honest
innocent
life
of
the
country
lad
who
never
leaves
the
latin
quarter
devoting
himself
wholly
to
his
work
with
thoughts
of
the
future
always
before
him
who
finds
flicoteaux
s
ordinary
luxurious
after
the
simple
and
strolls
for
recreation
along
the
alleys
of
the
luxembourg
the
blood
surging
back
to
his
heart
as
he
gives
timid
side
glances
to
the
pretty
women
but
this
could
not
last
lucien
with
his
poetic
temperament
and
boundless
longings
could
not
withstand
the
temptations
held
out
by
the
the
the
vaudeville
the
varietes
the
relieved
him
of
some
sixty
francs
although
he
always
went
to
the
pit
what
student
could
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
seeing
talma
in
one
of
his
famous
roles
lucien
was
fascinated
by
the
theatre
that
first
love
of
all
poetic
temperaments
the
actors
and
actresses
were
creatures
he
did
not
so
much
as
dream
of
the
possibility
of
crossing
the
footlights
and
meeting
them
on
familiar
terms
the
men
and
women
who
gave
him
so
much
pleasure
were
surely
marvelous
beings
whom
the
newspapers
treated
with
as
much
gravity
as
matters
of
national
interest
to
be
a
dramatic
author
to
have
a
play
produced
on
the
stage
what
a
dream
was
this
to
cherish
a
dream
which
a
few
bold
spirits
like
casimir
delavigne
had
actually
realized
thick
swarming
thoughts
like
these
and
moments
of
belief
in
himself
followed
by
despair
gave
lucien
no
rest
and
kept
him
in
the
narrow
way
of
toil
and
frugality
in
spite
of
the
smothered
grumblings
of
more
than
one
frenzied
desire
carrying
prudence
to
an
extreme
he
made
it
a
rule
never
to
enter
the
precincts
of
the
palais
royal
that
place
of
perdition
where
he
had
spent
fifty
francs
at
very
s
in
a
single
day
and
nearly
five
hundred
francs
on
his
clothes
and
when
he
yielded
to
temptation
and
saw
fleury
talma
the
two
baptistes
or
michot
he
went
no
further
than
the
murky
passage
where
used
to
stand
in
a
string
from
five
in
the
afternoon
till
the
hour
when
the
doors
opened
and
belated
comers
were
compelled
to
pay
ten
sous
for
a
place
near
the
and
after
waiting
for
two
hours
the
cry
of
all
tickets
are
sold
rang
not
unfrequently
in
the
ears
of
disappointed
students
when
the
play
was
over
lucien
went
home
with
downcast
eyes
through
streets
lined
with
living
attractions
and
perhaps
fell
in
with
one
of
those
commonplace
adventures
which
loom
so
large
in
a
young
and
timorous
imagination
one
day
lucien
counted
over
his
remaining
stock
of
money
and
took
alarm
at
the
melting
of
his
funds
a
cold
perspiration
broke
out
upon
him
when
he
thought
that
the
time
had
come
when
he
must
find
a
publisher
and
try
also
to
find
work
for
which
a
publisher
would
pay
him
the
young
journalist
with
whom
he
had
made
a
friendship
never
came
now
to
flicoteaux
s
lucien
was
waiting
for
a
chance
which
failed
to
present
itself
in
paris
there
are
no
chances
except
for
men
with
a
very
wide
circle
of
acquaintance
chances
of
success
of
every
kind
increase
with
the
number
of
your
connections
and
therefore
in
this
sense
also
the
chances
are
in
favor
of
the
big
battalions
lucien
had
sufficient
provincial
foresight
still
left
and
had
no
mind
to
wait
until
only
a
last
few
coins
remained
to
him
he
resolved
to
face
the
publishers
so
one
tolerably
chilly
september
morning
lucien
went
down
the
rue
de
la
harpe
with
his
two
manuscripts
under
his
arm
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
quai
des
augustins
and
went
along
looking
into
the
booksellers
windows
on
one
side
and
into
the
seine
on
the
other
his
good
genius
might
have
counseled
him
to
pitch
himself
into
the
water
sooner
than
plunge
into
literature
after
hesitations
after
a
profound
scrutiny
of
the
various
countenances
more
or
less
encouraging
churlish
cheerful
or
melancholy
to
be
seen
through
the
window
panes
or
in
the
doorways
of
the
booksellers
establishments
he
espied
a
house
where
the
shopmen
were
busy
packing
books
at
a
great
rate
goods
were
being
despatched
the
walls
were
plastered
with
bills
just
out

are

exclaimed
lucien
the
placard
a
new
and
original
idea
of
the
celebrated
ladvocat
was
just
beginning
to
blossom
out
upon
the
walls
in
no
long
space
paris
was
to
wear
motley
thanks
to
the
exertions
of
his
imitators
and
the
treasury
was
to
discover
a
new
source
of
revenue
anxiety
sent
the
blood
surging
to
lucien
s
heart
as
he
who
had
been
so
great
at
angouleme
so
insignificant
of
late
in
paris
slipped
past
the
other
houses
summoned
up
all
his
courage
and
at
last
entered
the
shop
thronged
with
assistants
customers
and
booksellers
and
authors
too
perhaps
thought
lucien
i
want
to
speak
with
vidal
or
porchon
he
said
addressing
a
shopman
he
had
read
the
names
on
the
vidal
porchon
it
ran
and
foreign
booksellers
both
gentlemen
are
engaged
said
the
man
i
will
left
to
himself
the
poet
scrutinized
the
packages
and
amused
himself
for
a
couple
of
hours
by
scanning
the
titles
of
books
looking
into
them
and
reading
a
page
or
two
here
and
there
at
last
as
he
stood
leaning
against
a
window
he
heard
voices
and
suspecting
that
the
green
curtains
hid
either
vidal
or
porchon
he
listened
to
the
conversation
will
you
take
five
hundred
copies
of
me
if
you
will
i
will
let
you
have
them
at
five
francs
and
give
fourteen

vidal
or

whichever
it
was
yes
said
the
vendor

inquired
the
purchaser
old
humbug

would
settle
with
me
in
eighteen
months
time
with
bills
at
a

settled
at
once
returned
vidal
or

at
nine
months
asked
the
publisher
or
author
who
evidently
was
selling
his
book
no
my
dear
fellow
twelve
months
returned
one
of
the
firm
of
booksellers
agents
there
was
a
pause
you
are
simply
cutting
my
throat
said
the
visitor
but
in
a
year
s
time
shall
we
have
placed
a
hundred
copies
of
said
the
other
voice
if
books
went
off
as
fast
as
the
publishers
would
like
we
should
be
millionaires
my
good
sir
but
they
don
t
they
go
as
the
public
pleases
there
is
some
one
now
bringing
out
an
edition
of
scott

at
eighteen

and
you
want
me
to
give
you
more

your
stale
remainders
no
if
you
mean
me
to
push
this
novel
of
yours
you
must
make
it
worth
my
vidal
a
stout
man
with
a
pen
behind
his
ear
came
down
from
his
desk
how
many
copies
of
ducange
did
you
place
last
journey
asked
porchon
of
his
partner
two
hundred
of
petit
vieillard
de
but
to
sell
them
i
was
obliged
to
cry
down
two
books
which
pay
in
less
commission
and
uncommonly
fine
nightingales
they
are
a
nightingale
as
lucien
afterwards
learned
is
a
bookseller
s
name
for
books
that
linger
on
hand
perched
out
of
sight
in
the
loneliest
nooks
in
the
shop
and
besides
added
vidal
picard
is
bringing
out
some
novels
as
you
know
we
have
been
promised
twenty
per
cent
on
the
published
price
to
make
the
thing
a
very
well
at
twelve
months
the
publisher
answered
in
a
piteous
voice
thunderstruck
by
vidal
s
confidential
remark
is
it
an
offer
porchon
inquired
curtly
the
stranger
went
out
after
he
had
gone
lucien
heard
porchon
say
to
vidal
we
have
three
hundred
copies
on
order
now
we
will
keep
him
waiting
for
his
settlement
sell
the
for
five
francs
net
settlement
in
six
months
and
and
that
will
be
fifteen
hundred
francs
into
our
pockets
said
vidal
oh
i
saw
quite
well
that
he
was
in
a
fix
he
is
giving
ducange
four
thousand
francs
for
two
thousand
lucien
cut
vidal
short
by
appearing
in
the
entrance
of
the
den
i
have
the
honor
of
wishing
you
a
good
day
gentlemen
he
said
addressing
both
partners
the
booksellers
nodded
slightly
i
have
a
french
historical
romance
after
the
style
of
scott
it
is
called
archer
of
charles
i
propose
to
offer
it
to
you
porchon
glanced
at
lucien
with
lustreless
eyes
and
laid
his
pen
down
on
the
desk
vidal
stared
rudely
at
the
author
we
are
not
publishing
booksellers
sir
we
are
booksellers
agents
he
said
when
we
bring
out
a
book
ourselves
we
only
deal
in
names
and
we
only
take
serious
literature
besides
history
and
but
my
book
is
very
serious
it
is
an
attempt
to
set
the
struggle
between
catholics
and
calvinists
in
its
true
light
the
catholics
were
supporters
of
absolute
monarchy
and
the
protestants
for
a
m
vidal
shouted
an
assistant
vidal
fled
i
don
t
say
sir
that
your
book
is
not
a
masterpiece
replied
porchon
with
scanty
civility
but
we
only
deal
in
books
that
are
ready
printed
go
and
see
somebody
that
buys
manuscripts
there
is
old
doguereau
in
the
rue
du
coq
near
the
louvre
he
is
in
the
romance
line
if
you
had
only
spoken
sooner
you
might
have
seen
pollet
a
competitor
of
doguereau
and
of
the
publisher
in
the
wooden
i
have
a
volume
of
poetry
m
porchon
somebody
shouted
porchon
exclaimed
angrily
for
what
do
you
take
me
he
added
laughing
in
lucien
s
face
and
he
dived
into
the
regions
of
the
back
shop
lucien
went
back
across
the
pont
neuf
absorbed
in
reflection
from
all
that
he
understood
of
this
mercantile
dialect
it
appeared
that
books
like
cotton
nightcaps
were
to
be
regarded
as
articles
of
merchandise
to
be
sold
dear
and
bought
cheap
i
have
made
a
mistake
said
lucien
to
himself
but
all
the
same
this
practical
aspect
of
literature
made
an
impression
upon
him
in
the
rue
du
coq
he
stopped
in
front
of
a
shop
which
he
had
passed
before
he
saw
the
inscription
doguereau
bookseller
painted
above
it
in
yellow
letters
on
a
green
ground
and
remembered
that
he
had
seen
the
name
at
the
foot
of
the
of
several
novels
at
blosse
s
in
he
went
not
without
the
inward
trepidation
which
a
man
of
any
imagination
feels
at
the
prospect
of
a
battle
inside
the
shop
he
discovered
an
old
man
one
of
the
queer
characters
of
the
trade
in
the
days
of
the
empire
doguereau
wore
a
black
coat
with
vast
square
skirts
when
fashion
required
coats
his
waistcoat
was
of
some
cheap
material
a
checked
pattern
of
many
colors
a
steel
chain
with
a
copper
key
attached
to
it
hung
from
his
fob
and
dangled
down
over
a
roomy
pair
of
black
nether
garments
the
booksellers
watch
must
have
been
the
size
of
an
onion
ribbed
stockings
and
shoes
with
silver
buckles
completed
is
costume
the
old
man
s
head
was
bare
and
ornamented
with
a
fringe
of
grizzled
locks
quite
poetically
scanty
old
doguereau
as
porchon
styled
him
was
dressed
half
like
a
professor
of
as
to
his
trousers
and
shoes
half
like
a
tradesman
with
respect
to
the
variegated
waistcoat
the
stockings
and
the
watch
and
the
same
odd
mixture
appeared
in
the
man
himself
he
united
the
magisterial
dogmatic
air
and
the
hollow
countenance
of
the
professor
of
rhetoric
with
the
sharp
eyes
suspicious
mouth
and
vague
uneasiness
of
the
bookseller
m
doguereau
asked
lucien
that
is
my
name
you
are
very
young
remarked
the
bookseller
my
age
sir
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
true
and
the
old
bookseller
took
up
the
manuscript
ah
begad
archer
of
charles
a
good
title
let
us
see
now
young
man
just
tell
me
your
subject
in
a
word
or
it
is
a
historical
work
sir
in
the
style
of
scott
the
character
of
the
struggle
between
the
protestants
and
catholics
is
depicted
as
a
struggle
between
two
opposed
systems
of
government
in
which
the
throne
is
seriously
endangered
i
have
taken
the
catholic
eh
but
you
have
ideas
young
man
very
well
i
will
read
your
book
i
promise
you
i
would
rather
have
had
something
more
in
radcliffe
s
style
but
if
you
are
industrious
if
you
have
some
notion
of
style
conceptions
ideas
and
the
art
of
telling
a
story
i
don
t
ask
better
than
to
be
of
use
to
you
what
do
we
want
but
good
manuscripts
when
can
i
come
back
i
am
going
into
the
country
this
evening
i
shall
be
back
again
the
day
after
i
shall
have
read
your
manuscript
by
that
time
and
if
it
suits
me
we
might
come
to
terms
that
very
seeing
his
acquaintance
so
easy
lucien
was
inspired
with
the
unlucky
idea
of
bringing
the
upon
the
scene
i
have
a
volume
of
poetry
as
well
sir
he
began
oh
you
are
a
poet
then
i
don
t
want
your
romance
and
the
old
man
handed
back
the
manuscript
the
rhyming
fellows
come
to
grief
when
they
try
their
hands
at
prose
in
prose
you
can
t
use
words
that
mean
nothing
you
absolutely
must
say
but
sir
walter
scott
sir
wrote
poetry
as
well
as
that
is
true
said
doguereau
relenting
he
guessed
that
the
young
fellow
before
him
was
poor
and
kept
the
manuscript
where
do
you
live
i
will
come
and
see
lucien
all
unsuspicious
of
the
idea
at
the
back
of
the
old
man
s
head
gave
his
address
he
did
not
see
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
bookseller
of
the
old
school
a
survival
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
booksellers
tried
to
keep
voltaires
and
montesquieus
starving
in
garrets
under
lock
and
key
the
latin
quarter
i
am
coming
back
that
very
way
said
doguereau
when
he
had
read
the
address
good
man
thought
lucien
as
he
took
his
leave
so
i
have
met
with
a
friend
to
young
authors
a
man
of
taste
who
knows
something
that
is
the
kind
of
man
for
me
it
is
just
as
i
said
to
david
talent
soon
makes
its
way
in
lucien
went
home
again
happy
and
light
of
heart
he
dreamed
of
glory
he
gave
not
another
thought
to
the
ominous
words
which
fell
on
his
ear
as
he
stood
by
the
counter
in
vidal
and
porchon
s
shop
he
beheld
himself
the
richer
by
twelve
hundred
francs
at
least
twelve
hundred
francs
it
meant
a
year
in
paris
a
whole
year
of
preparation
for
the
work
that
he
meant
to
do
what
plans
he
built
on
that
hope
what
sweet
dreams
what
visions
of
a
life
established
on
a
basis
of
work
mentally
he
found
new
quarters
and
settled
himself
in
them
it
would
not
have
taken
much
to
set
him
making
a
purchase
or
two
he
could
only
stave
off
impatience
by
constant
reading
at
blosse
s
two
days
later
old
doguereau
come
to
the
lodgings
of
his
budding
sir
walter
scott
he
was
struck
with
the
pains
which
lucien
had
taken
with
the
style
of
this
his
first
work
delighted
with
the
strong
contrasts
of
character
sanctioned
by
the
epoch
and
surprised
at
the
spirited
imagination
which
a
young
writer
always
displays
in
the
scheming
of
a
first
plot
he
had
not
been
spoiled
thought
old
daddy
doguereau
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
give
a
thousand
francs
for
archer
of
charles
he
would
buy
the
copyright
out
and
out
and
bind
lucien
by
an
engagement
for
several
books
but
when
he
came
to
look
at
the
house
the
old
fox
thought
better
of
it
a
young
fellow
that
lives
here
has
none
but
simple
tastes
said
he
to
himself
he
is
fond
of
study
fond
of
work
i
need
not
give
more
than
eight
hundred
fourth
floor
answered
the
landlady
when
he
asked
for
lucien
de
rubempre
the
old
bookseller
peering
up
saw
nothing
but
the
sky
above
the
fourth
floor
this
young
fellow
thought
he
is
a
lad
one
might
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
is
very
handsome
if
he
were
to
make
too
much
money
he
would
only
fall
into
dissipated
ways
and
then
he
would
not
work
in
the
interests
of
us
both
i
shall
only
offer
six
hundred
francs
in
coin
though
not
he
climbed
the
stairs
and
gave
three
raps
at
the
door
lucien
came
to
open
it
the
room
was
forlorn
in
its
bareness
a
bowl
of
milk
and
a
penny
roll
stood
on
the
table
the
destitution
of
genius
made
an
impression
on
daddy
doguereau
let
him
preserve
these
simple
habits
of
life
this
frugality
these
modest
requirements
thought
aloud
he
said
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
see
you
thus
sir
lived
whom
you
resemble
in
more
ways
than
one
amid
such
surroundings
the
fire
of
genius
shines
brightly
good
work
is
done
in
such
rooms
as
these
this
is
how
men
of
letters
should
work
instead
of
living
riotously
in
cafes
and
restaurants
wasting
their
time
and
talent
and
our
he
sat
down
your
romance
is
not
bad
young
man
i
was
a
professor
of
rhetoric
once
i
know
french
history
there
are
some
capital
things
in
it
you
have
a
future
before
you
in
oh
no
i
tell
you
so
we
may
do
business
together
i
will
buy
your
lucien
s
heart
swelled
and
throbbed
with
gladness
he
was
about
to
enter
the
world
of
literature
he
should
see
himself
in
print
at
last
i
will
give
you
four
hundred
francs
continued
doguereau
in
honeyed
accents
and
he
looked
at
lucien
with
an
air
which
seemed
to
betoken
an
effort
of
generosity
the
volume
queried
lucien
for
the
romance
said
doguereau
heedless
of
lucien
s
surprise
in
ready
money
he
added
and
you
shall
undertake
to
write
two
books
for
me
every
year
for
six
years
if
the
first
book
is
out
of
print
in
six
months
i
will
give
you
six
hundred
francs
for
the
others
so
if
you
write
two
books
each
year
you
will
be
making
a
hundred
francs
a
month
you
will
have
a
sure
income
you
will
be
well
off
there
are
some
authors
whom
i
only
pay
three
hundred
francs
for
a
romance
i
give
two
hundred
for
translations
of
english
books
such
prices
would
have
been
exorbitant
in
the
old
sir
we
can
not
possibly
come
to
an
understanding
give
me
back
my
manuscript
i
beg
said
lucien
in
a
cold
chill
here
it
is
said
the
old
bookseller
you
know
nothing
of
business
sir
before
an
author
s
first
book
can

authoritatively
by
way
of

by

on

floor

would
rather

he
exclaimed
you
have
a
poet
s
head
returned
his
senior
lucien
devoured
his
bread
and
supped
his
bowl
of
milk
then
he
went
downstairs
his
room
was
not
large
enough
for
him
he
was
turning
round
and
round
in
it
like
a
lion
in
a
cage
at
the
jardin
des
plantes
at
the
bibliotheque
whither
lucien
was
going
he
had
come
to
know
a
stranger
by
sight
a
young
man
of
or
thereabouts
working
with
the
sustained
industry
which
nothing
can
disturb
nor
distract
the
sign
by
which
your
genuine
literary
worker
is
known
evidently
the
young
man
had
been
reading
there
for
some
time
for
the
librarian
and
attendants
all
knew
him
and
paid
him
special
attention
the
librarian
would
even
allow
him
to
take
away
books
with
which
lucien
saw
him
return
in
the
morning
in
the
stranger
student
he
recognized
a
brother
in
penury
and
hope
and
slight
and
thin
with
a
fine
forehead
hidden
by
masses
of
black
tolerably
unkempt
hair
there
was
something
about
him
that
attracted
indifferent
eyes
it
was
a
vague
resemblance
which
he
bore
to
portraits
of
the
young
bonaparte
engraved
from
robert
lefebvre
s
picture
that
engraving
is
a
poem
of
melancholy
intensity
of
suppressed
ambition
of
power
working
below
the
surface
study
the
face
carefully
and
you
will
discover
genius
in
it
and
discretion
and
all
the
subtlety
and
greatness
of
the
man
the
portrait
has
speaking
eyes
like
a
woman
s
they
look
out
greedy
of
space
craving
difficulties
to
vanquish
even
if
the
name
of
bonaparte
were
not
written
beneath
it
you
would
gaze
long
at
that
face
lucien
s
young
student
the
incarnation
of
this
picture
usually
wore
footed
trousers
shoes
with
thick
soles
to
them
an
overcoat
of
coarse
cloth
a
black
cravat
a
waistcoat
of
some
material
buttoned
to
the
chin
and
a
cheap
hat
contempt
for
superfluity
in
dress
was
visible
in
his
whole
person
lucien
also
discovered
that
the
mysterious
stranger
with
that
unmistakable
stamp
which
genius
sets
upon
the
forehead
of
its
slaves
was
one
of
flicoteaux
s
most
regular
customers
he
ate
to
live
careless
of
the
fare
which
appeared
to
be
familiar
to
him
and
drank
water
wherever
lucien
saw
him
at
the
library
or
at
flicoteaux
s
there
was
a
dignity
in
his
manner
springing
doubtless
from
the
consciousness
of
a
purpose
that
filled
his
life
a
dignity
which
made
him
unapproachable
he
had
the
expression
of
a
thinker
meditation
dwelt
on
the
fine
nobly
carved
brow
you
could
tell
from
the
dark
bright
eyes
so
and
quick
to
observe
that
their
owner
was
wont
to
probe
to
the
bottom
of
things
he
gesticulated
very
little
his
demeanor
was
grave
lucien
felt
an
involuntary
respect
for
him
many
times
already
the
pair
had
looked
at
each
other
at
the
bibliotheque
or
at
flicoteaux
s
many
times
they
had
been
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
neither
of
them
had
ventured
so
far
as
yet
the
silent
young
man
went
off
to
the
further
end
of
the
library
on
the
side
at
right
angles
to
the
place
de
la
sorbonne
and
lucien
had
no
opportunity
of
making
his
acquaintance
although
he
felt
drawn
to
a
worker
whom
he
knew
by
indescribable
tokens
for
a
character
of
no
common
order
both
as
they
came
to
know
afterwards
were
unsophisticated
and
shy
given
to
fears
which
cause
a
pleasurable
emotion
to
solitary
creatures
perhaps
they
never
would
have
been
brought
into
communication
if
they
had
not
come
across
each
other
that
day
of
lucien
s
disaster
for
as
lucien
turned
into
the
rue
des
gres
he
saw
the
student
coming
away
from
the
bibliotheque
the
library
is
closed
i
don
t
know
why
monsieur
said
he
tears
were
standing
in
lucien
s
eyes
he
expressed
his
thanks
by
one
of
those
gestures
that
speak
more
eloquently
than
words
and
unlock
hearts
at
once
when
two
men
meet
in
youth
they
went
together
along
the
rue
des
gres
towards
the
rue
de
la
harpe
as
that
is
so
i
shall
go
to
the
luxembourg
for
a
walk
said
lucien
when
you
have
come
out
it
is
not
easy
to
settle
down
to
work
no
one
s
ideas
will
not
flow
in
the
proper
current
remarked
the
stranger
something
seems
to
have
annoyed
you
monsieur
i
have
just
had
a
queer
adventure
said
lucien
and
he
told
the
history
of
his
visit
to
the
quai
and
gave
an
account
of
his
subsequent
dealings
with
the
old
bookseller
he
gave
his
name
and
said
a
word
or
two
of
his
position
in
one
month
or
thereabouts
he
had
spent
sixty
francs
on
his
board
thirty
for
lodging
twenty
more
francs
in
going
to
the
theatre
and
ten
at
blosse
s
reading
room
one
hundred
and
twenty
francs
in
all
and
now
he
had
just
a
hundred
and
twenty
francs
in
hand
your
story
is
mine
monsieur
and
the
story
of
ten
or
twelve
hundred
young
fellows
besides
who
come
from
the
country
to
paris
every
year
there
are
others
even
worse
off
than
we
are
do
you
see
that
theatre
he
continued
indicating
the
turrets
of
the
odeon
there
came
one
day
to
lodge
in
one
of
the
houses
in
the
square
a
man
of
talent
who
had
fallen
into
the
lowest
depths
of
poverty
he
was
married
in
addition
to
the
misfortunes
which
we
share
with
him
to
a
wife
whom
he
loved
and
the
poorer
or
the
richer
as
you
will
by
two
children
he
was
burdened
with
debt
but
he
put
his
faith
in
his
pen
he
took
a
comedy
in
five
acts
to
the
odeon
the
comedy
was
accepted
the
management
arranged
to
bring
it
out
the
actors
learned
their
parts
the
stage
manager
urged
on
the
rehearsals
five
several
bits
of
luck
five
dramas
to
be
performed
in
real
life
and
far
harder
tasks
than
the
writing
of
a
play
the
poor
author
lodged
in
a
garret
you
can
see
the
place
from
here
he
drained
his
last
resources
to
live
until
the
first
representation
his
wife
pawned
her
clothes
they
all
lived
on
dry
bread
on
the
day
of
the
final
rehearsal
the
household
owed
fifty
francs
in
the
quarter
to
the
baker
the
milkwoman
and
the
porter
the
author
had
only
the
strictly
necessary
clothes
a
coat
a
shirt
trousers
a
waistcoat
and
a
pair
of
boots
he
felt
sure
of
his
success
he
kissed
his
wife
the
end
of
their
troubles
was
at
hand
at
last
there
is
nothing
against
us
now
cried
yes
there
is
fire
said
his
wife
look
the
odeon
is
on
fire
the
odeon
was
on
fire
monsieur
so
do
not
you
complain
you
have
clothes
you
have
neither
wife
nor
child
you
have
a
hundred
and
twenty
francs
for
emergencies
in
your
pocket
and
you
owe
no
one
a
well
the
piece
went
through
a
hundred
and
fifty
representations
at
the
theatre
louvois
the
king
allowed
the
author
a
pension
genius
is
patience
as
buffon
said
and
patience
after
all
is
a
man
s
nearest
approach
to
nature
s
processes
of
creation
what
is
art
monsieur
but
nature
concentrated
by
this
time
the
young
men
were
striding
along
the
walks
of
the
luxembourg
and
in
no
long
time
lucien
learned
the
name
of
the
stranger
who
was
doing
his
best
to
administer
comfort
that
name
has
since
grown
famous
daniel
d
arthez
is
one
of
the
most
illustrious
of
living
men
of
letters
one
of
the
rare
few
who
show
us
an
example
of
a
noble
gift
with
a
noble
nature
combined
to
quote
a
poet
s
fine
thought
there
is
no
cheap
route
to
greatness
daniel
went
on
in
his
kind
voice
the
works
of
genius
are
watered
with
tears
the
gift
that
is
in
you
like
an
existence
in
the
physical
world
passes
through
childhood
and
its
maladies
nature
sweeps
away
sickly
or
deformed
creatures
and
society
rejects
an
imperfectly
developed
talent
any
man
who
means
to
rise
above
the
rest
must
make
ready
for
a
struggle
and
be
undaunted
by
difficulties
a
great
writer
is
a
martyr
who
does
not
die
that
is
there
is
the
stamp
of
genius
on
your
forehead
d
arthez
continued
enveloping
lucien
by
a
glance
but
unless
you
have
within
you
the
will
of
genius
unless
you
are
gifted
with
angelic
patience
unless
no
matter
how
far
the
freaks
of
fate
have
set
you
from
your
destined
goal
you
can
find
the
way
to
your
infinite
as
the
turtles
in
the
indies
find
their
way
to
the
ocean
you
had
better
give
up
at
then
do
you
yourself
expect
these
ordeals
asked
lucien
trials
of
every
kind
slander
and
treachery
and
effrontery
and
cunning
the
rivals
who
act
unfairly
and
the
keen
competition
of
the
literary
market
his
companion
said
resignedly
what
is
a
first
loss
if
only
your
work
was
good
will
you
look
at
mine
and
give
me
your
opinion
asked
lucien
so
be
it
said
d
arthez
i
am
living
in
the
rue
des
desplein
one
of
the
most
illustrious
men
of
genius
in
our
time
the
greatest
surgeon
that
the
world
has
known
once
endured
the
martyrdom
of
early
struggles
with
the
first
difficulties
of
a
glorious
career
in
the
same
house
i
think
of
that
every
night
and
the
thought
gives
me
the
stock
of
courage
that
i
need
every
morning
i
am
living
in
the
very
room
where
like
rousseau
he
had
no
theresa
come
in
an
hour
s
time
i
shall
be
the
poets
grasped
each
other
s
hands
with
a
rush
of
melancholy
and
tender
feeling
inexpressible
in
words
and
went
their
separate
ways
lucien
to
fetch
his
manuscript
daniel
d
arthez
to
pawn
his
watch
and
buy
a
couple
of
faggots
the
weather
was
cold
and
his
friend
should
find
a
fire
in
his
room
lucien
was
punctual
he
noticed
at
once
that
the
house
was
of
an
even
poorer
class
than
the
hotel
de
cluny
a
staircase
gradually
became
visible
at
the
further
end
of
a
dark
passage
he
mounted
to
the
fifth
floor
and
found
d
arthez
s
room
a
bookcase
of
wood
with
rows
of
labeled
cardboard
cases
on
the
shelves
stood
between
the
two
crazy
windows
a
gaunt
painted
wooden
bedstead
of
the
kind
seen
in
school
dormitories
a
picked
up
cheaply
somewhere
and
a
couple
of
horsehair
armchairs
filled
the
further
end
of
the
room
the
a
highland
plaid
pattern
was
glazed
over
with
the
grime
of
years
between
the
window
and
the
grate
stood
a
long
table
littered
with
papers
and
opposite
the
fireplace
there
was
a
cheap
mahogany
chest
of
drawers
a
carpet
covered
the
floor
a
necessary
luxury
for
it
saved
firing
a
common
office
armchair
cushioned
with
leather
crimson
once
but
now
hoary
with
wear
was
drawn
up
to
the
table
add
rickety
chairs
and
you
have
a
complete
list
of
the
furniture
lucien
noticed
an
for
a
with
an
adjustable
screen
attached
and
wondered
to
see
four
wax
candles
in
the
sockets
d
arthez
explained
that
he
could
not
endure
the
smell
of
tallow
a
little
trait
denoting
great
delicacy
of
sense
perception
and
the
exquisite
sensibility
which
accompanies
it
the
reading
lasted
for
seven
hours
daniel
listened
conscientiously
forbearing
to
interrupt
by
word
or
comment
one
of
the
rarest
proofs
of
good
taste
in
a
listener
well
queried
lucien
laying
the
manuscript
on
the
you
have
made
a
good
start
on
the
right
way
d
arthez
answered
judicially
but
you
must
go
over
your
work
again
you
must
strike
out
a
different
style
for
yourself
if
you
do
not
mean
to
ape
sir
walter
scott
for
you
have
taken
him
for
your
model
you
begin
for
instance
as
he
begins
with
long
conversations
to
introduce
your
characters
and
only
when
they
have
said
their
say
does
description
and
action
follow
this
opposition
necessary
in
all
work
of
a
dramatic
kind
comes
last
just
put
the
terms
of
the
problem
the
other
way
round
give
descriptions
to
which
our
language
lends
itself
so
admirably
instead
of
diffuse
dialogue
magnificent
in
scott
s
work
but
colorless
in
your
own
lead
naturally
up
to
your
dialogue
plunge
straight
into
the
action
treat
your
subject
from
different
points
of
view
sometimes
in
a
sometimes
retrospectively
vary
your
methods
in
fact
to
diversify
your
work
you
may
be
original
while
adapting
the
scots
novelist
s
form
of
dramatic
dialogue
to
french
history
there
is
no
passion
in
scott
s
novels
he
ignores
passion
or
perhaps
it
was
interdicted
by
the
hypocritical
manners
of
his
country
woman
for
him
is
duty
incarnate
his
heroines
with
possibly
one
or
two
exceptions
are
all
alike
he
has
drawn
them
all
from
the
same
model
as
painters
say
they
are
every
one
of
them
descended
from
clarissa
harlowe
and
returning
continually
as
he
did
to
the
same
idea
of
woman
how
could
he
do
otherwise
than
produce
a
single
type
varied
only
by
degrees
of
vividness
in
the
coloring
woman
brings
confusion
into
society
through
passion
passion
gives
infinite
possibilities
therefore
depict
passion
you
have
one
great
resource
open
to
you
foregone
by
the
great
genius
for
the
sake
of
providing
family
reading
for
prudish
england
in
france
you
have
the
charming
sinner
the
life
of
catholicism
contrasted
with
sombre
calvinistic
figures
on
a
background
of
the
times
when
passions
ran
higher
than
at
any
other
period
of
our
history
every
epoch
which
has
left
authentic
records
since
the
time
of
charles
the
great
calls
for
at
least
one
romance
some
require
four
or
five
the
periods
of
louis
of
henry
of
francis
for
instance
you
would
give
us
in
this
way
a
picturesque
history
of
france
with
the
costumes
and
furniture
the
houses
and
their
interiors
and
domestic
life
giving
us
the
spirit
of
the
time
instead
of
a
laborious

of

as
he

not
as
protestant
writers
have
made
him
ten
years
of
persistent
work
and
fame
and
fortune
will
be
by
this
time
it
was
nine
o
clock
lucien
followed
the
example
set
in
secret
by
his
future
friend
by
asking
him
to
dine
at
eldon
s
and
spent
twelve
francs
at
that
restaurant
during
the
dinner
daniel
admitted
lucien
into
the
secret
of
his
hopes
and
studies
daniel
d
arthez
would
not
allow
that
any
writer
could
attain
to
a
rank
without
a
profound
knowledge
of
metaphysics
he
was
engaged
in
ransacking
the
spoils
of
ancient
and
modern
philosophy
and
in
the
assimilation
of
it
all
he
would
be
like
moliere
a
profound
philosopher
first
and
a
writer
of
comedies
afterwards
he
was
studying
the
world
of
books
and
the
living
world
about
him
thought
and
fact
his
friends
were
learned
naturalists
young
doctors
of
medicine
political
writers
and
artists
a
number
of
earnest
students
full
of
promise
d
arthez
earned
a
living
by
conscientious
and
work
he
wrote
articles
for
encyclopaedias
dictionaries
of
biography
and
natural
science
doing
just
enough
to
enable
him
to
live
while
he
followed
his
own
bent
and
neither
more
nor
less
he
had
a
piece
of
imaginative
work
on
hand
undertaken
solely
for
the
sake
of
studying
the
resources
of
language
an
important
psychological
study
in
the
form
of
a
novel
unfinished
as
yet
for
d
arthez
took
it
up
or
laid
it
down
as
the
humor
took
him
and
kept
it
for
days
of
great
distress
d
arthez
s
revelations
of
himself
were
made
very
simply
but
to
lucien
he
seemed
like
an
intellectual
giant
and
by
eleven
o
clock
when
they
left
the
restaurant
he
began
to
feel
a
sudden
warm
friendship
for
this
nature
unconscious
of
its
loftiness
this
unostentatious
worth
lucien
took
d
arthez
s
advice
unquestioningly
and
followed
it
out
to
the
letter
the
most
magnificent
palaces
of
fancy
had
been
suddenly
flung
open
to
him
by
a
mind
matured
already
by
thought
and
critical
examinations
undertaken
for
their
own
sake
not
for
publication
but
for
the
solitary
thinker
s
own
satisfaction
the
burning
coal
had
been
laid
on
the
lips
of
the
poet
of
angouleme
a
word
uttered
by
a
hard
student
in
paris
had
fallen
upon
ground
prepared
to
receive
it
in
the
provincial
lucien
set
about
recasting
his
work
in
his
gladness
at
finding
in
the
wilderness
of
paris
a
nature
abounding
in
generous
and
sympathetic
feeling
the
distinguished
provincial
did
as
all
young
creatures
hungering
for
affection
are
wont
to
do
he
fastened
like
a
chronic
disease
upon
this
one
friend
that
he
had
found
he
called
for
d
arthez
on
his
way
to
the
bibliotheque
walked
with
him
on
fine
days
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
and
went
with
his
friend
every
evening
as
far
as
the
door
of
his
after
sitting
next
to
him
at
flicoteaux
s
he
pressed
close
to
his
friend
s
side
as
a
soldier
might
keep
by
a
comrade
on
the
frozen
russian
plains
during
those
early
days
of
his
acquaintance
he
noticed
not
without
chagrin
that
his
presence
imposed
a
certain
restraint
on
the
circle
of
daniel
s
intimates
the
talk
of
those
superior
beings
of
whom
d
arthez
spoke
to
him
with
such
concentrated
enthusiasm
kept
within
the
bounds
of
a
reserve
but
little
in
keeping
with
the
evident
warmth
of
their
friendships
at
these
times
lucien
discreetly
took
his
leave
a
feeling
of
curiosity
mingling
with
the
sense
of
something
like
pain
at
the
ostracism
to
which
he
was
subjected
by
these
strangers
who
all
addressed
each
other
by
their
christian
names
each
one
of
them
like
d
arthez
bore
the
stamp
of
genius
upon
his
forehead
after
some
private
opposition
overcome
by
d
arthez
without
lucien
s
knowledge
the
newcomer
was
at
length
judged
worthy
to
make
one
of
the
of
lofty
thinkers
henceforward
he
was
to
be
one
of
a
little
group
of
young
men
who
met
almost
every
evening
in
d
arthez
s
room
united
by
the
keenest
sympathies
and
by
the
earnestness
of
their
intellectual
life
they
all
foresaw
a
great
writer
in
d
arthez
they
looked
upon
him
as
their
chief
since
the
loss
of
one
of
their
number
a
mystical
genius
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
intellects
of
the
age
this
former
leader
had
gone
back
to
his
province
for
reasons
on
which
it
serves
no
purpose
to
enter
but
lucien
often
heard
them
speak
of
this
absent
friend
as
several
of
the
group
were
destined
to
fall
by
the
way
but
others
like
d
arthez
have
since
won
all
the
fame
that
was
their
due
a
few
details
as
to
the
circle
will
readily
explain
lucien
s
strong
feeling
of
interest
and
curiosity
one
among
those
who
still
survive
was
horace
bianchon
then
a
at
the
later
a
shining
light
at
the
ecole
de
paris
and
now
so
well
known
that
it
is
needless
to
give
any
description
of
his
appearance
genius
or
character
next
came
leon
giraud
that
profound
philosopher
and
bold
theorist
turning
all
systems
inside
out
criticising
expressing
and
formulating
dragging
them
all
to
the
feet
of
his
idol
humanity
great
even
in
his
errors
for
his
honesty
ennobled
his
mistakes
an
intrepid
toiler
a
conscientious
scholar
he
became
the
acknowledged
head
of
a
school
of
moralists
and
politicians
time
alone
can
pronounce
upon
the
merits
of
his
theories
but
if
his
convictions
have
drawn
him
into
paths
in
which
none
of
his
old
comrades
tread
none
the
less
he
is
still
their
faithful
friend
art
was
represented
by
joseph
bridau
one
of
the
best
painters
among
the
younger
men
but
for
a
too
impressionable
nature
which
made
havoc
of
joseph
s
heart
he
might
have
continued
the
traditions
of
the
great
italian
masters
though
for
that
matter
the
last
word
has
not
yet
been
said
concerning
him
he
combines
roman
outline
with
venetian
color
but
love
is
fatal
to
his
work
love
not
merely
transfixes
his
heart
but
sends
his
arrow
through
the
brain
deranges
the
course
of
his
life
and
sets
the
victim
describing
the
strangest
zigzags
if
the
mistress
of
the
moment
is
too
kind
or
too
cruel
joseph
will
send
into
the
exhibition
sketches
where
the
drawing
is
clogged
with
color
or
pictures
finished
under
the
stress
of
some
imaginary
woe
in
which
he
gave
his
whole
attention
to
the
drawing
and
left
the
color
to
take
care
of
itself
he
is
a
constant
disappointment
to
his
friends
and
the
public
yet
hoffmann
would
have
worshiped
him
for
his
daring
experiments
in
the
realms
of
art
when
bridau
is
wholly
himself
he
is
admirable
and
as
praise
is
sweet
to
him
his
disgust
is
great
when
one
praises
the
failures
in
which
he
alone
discovers
all
that
is
lacking
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
he
is
whimsical
to
the
last
degree
his
friends
have
seen
him
destroy
a
finished
picture
because
in
his
eyes
it
looked
too
smooth
it
is
overdone
he
would
say
it
is
niggling
with
his
eccentric
yet
lofty
nature
with
a
nervous
organization
and
all
that
it
entails
of
torment
and
delight
the
craving
for
perfection
becomes
morbid
intellectually
he
is
akin
to
sterne
though
he
is
not
a
literary
worker
there
is
an
indescribable
piquancy
about
his
epigrams
and
sallies
of
thought
he
is
eloquent
he
knows
how
to
love
but
the
uncertainty
that
appears
in
his
execution
is
a
part
of
the
very
nature
of
the
man
the
brotherhood
loved
him
for
the
very
qualities
which
the
philistine
would
style
defects
last
among
the
living
comes
fulgence
ridal
no
writer
of
our
times
possesses
more
of
the
exuberant
spirit
of
pure
comedy
than
this
poet
careless
of
fame
who
will
fling
his
more
commonplace
productions
to
theatrical
managers
and
keep
the
most
charming
scenes
in
the
seraglio
of
his
brain
for
himself
and
his
friends
of
the
public
he
asks
just
sufficient
to
secure
his
independence
and
then
declines
to
do
anything
more
indolent
and
prolific
as
rossini
compelled
like
great
like
moliere
and
rabelais
to
see
both
sides
of
everything
and
all
that
is
to
be

both

if

bestirs
himself
it

question

into

of

politician
of
the
calibre

for

more
dangerous
to

than
the
hideous
doctrines
of
indefinite
liberty
proclaimed
by

young

an
analyst
there

plenty
of

not

speakers

also
the

would
talk
over

work
among
themselves
and
take
counsel
of
each
other
with
the
delightful
openness
of
youth
if
the
matter
in
hand
was
serious
the
opponent
would
leave
his

position
to
enter
into
his

point

being
an
impartial
judge

hideous
treasure
of

abortive

failure
and
mortified
vanity
was
quite
unknown
among

all
of
them
moreover
were
going
their
separate
ways
for
these
reasons
lucien
and
others
admitted
to
their
society
felt
at
their
ease
in
it
wherever
you
find
real
talent
you
will
find
frank
good
fellowship
and
sincerity
and
no
sort
of
pretension
the
wit
that
caresses
the
intellect
and
never
is
aimed
at
when
the
first
nervousness
caused
by
respect
wore
off
it
was
unspeakably
pleasant
to
make
one
of
this
elect
company
of
youth
familiarity
did
not
exclude
in
each
a
consciousness
of
his
own
value
nor
a
profound
esteem
for
his
neighbor
and
finally
as
every
member
of
the
circle
felt
that
he
could
afford
to
receive
or
to
give
no
one

a
difficulty
of
accepting
talk
was
unflagging
full
of
charm
and
ranging
over
the
most
varied
topics
words
light
as
arrows
sped
to
the
mark
there
was
a
strange
contrast
between
the
dire
material
poverty
in
which
the
young
men
lived
and
the
splendor
of
their
intellectual
wealth
they
looked
upon
the
practical
problems
of
existence
simply
as
matter
for
friendly
jokes
the
cold
weather
happened
to
set
in
early
that
year
five
of
d
arthez
s
friends
appeared
one
day
each
concealing
firewood
under
his
cloak
the
same
idea
had
occurred
to
the
five
as
it
sometimes
happens
that
all
the
guests
at
a
picnic
are
inspired
with
the
notion
of
bringing
a
pie
as
their
contribution
all
of
them
were
gifted
with
the
moral
beauty
which
reacts
upon
the
physical
form
and
no
less
than
work
and
vigils
overlays
a
youthful
face
with
a
shade
of
divine
gold
purity
of
life
and
the
fire
of
thought
had
brought
refinement
and
regularity
into
features
somewhat
pinched
and
rugged
the
poet
s
amplitude
of
brow
was
a
striking
characteristic
common
to
them
all
the
bright
sparkling
eyes
told
of
cleanliness
of
life
the
hardships
of
penury
when
they
were
felt
at
all
were
born
so
gaily
and
embraced
with
such
enthusiasm
that
they
had
left
no
trace
to
mar
the
serenity
peculiar
to
the
faces
of
the
young
who
have
no
grave
errors
laid
to
their
charge
as
yet
who
have
not
stooped
to
any
of
the
base
compromises
wrung
from
impatience
of
poverty
by
the
strong
desire
to
succeed
the
temptation
to
use
any
means
to
this
end
is
the
greater
since
that
men
of
letters
are
lenient
with
bad
faith
and
extend
an
easy
indulgence
to
treachery
there
is
an
element
in
friendship
which
doubles
its
charm
and
renders
it
indissoluble
a
sense
of
certainty
which
is
lacking
in
love
these
young
men
were
sure
of
themselves
and
of
each
other
the
enemy
of
one
was
the
enemy
of
all
the
most
urgent
personal
considerations
would
have
been
shattered
if
they
had
clashed
with
the
sacred
solidarity
of
their
fellowship
all
alike
incapable
of
disloyalty
they
could
oppose
a
formidable
no
to
any
accusation
brought
against
the
absent
and
defend
them
with
perfect
confidence
with
a
like
nobility
of
nature
and
strength
of
feeling
it
was
possible
to
think
and
speak
freely
on
all
matters
of
intellectual
or
scientific
interest
hence
the
honesty
of
their
friendships
the
gaiety
of
their
talk
and
with
this
intellectual
freedom
of
the
community
there
was
no
fear
of
being
misunderstood
they
stood
upon
no
ceremony
with
each
other
they
shared
their
troubles
and
joys
and
gave
thought
and
sympathy
from
full
hearts
the
charming
delicacy
of
feeling
which
makes
the
tale
of
a
treasury
for
great
souls
was
the
rule
of
their
daily
life
it
may
be
imagined
therefore
that
their
standard
of
requirements
was
not
an
easy
one
they
were
too
conscious
of
their
worth
too
well
aware
of
their
happiness
to
care
to
trouble
their
life
with
the
admixture
of
a
new
and
unknown
element
this
federation
of
interests
and
affection
lasted
for
twenty
years
without
a
collision
or
disappointment
death
alone
could
thin
the
numbers
of
the
noble
pleiades
taking
first
louis
lambert
later
meyraux
and
michel
chrestien
when
michel
chrestien
fell
in
his
friends
went
in
spite
of
the
perils
of
the
step
to
find
his
body
at
and
horace
bianchon
daniel
d
arthez
leon
giraud
joseph
bridau
and
fulgence
ridal
performed
the
last
duties
to
the
dead
between
two
political
fires
by
night
they
buried
their
beloved
in
the
cemetery
of
horace
bianchon
undaunted
by
the
difficulties
cleared
them
away
one
after
another
it
was
he
indeed
who
besought
the
authorities
for
permission
to
bury
the
fallen
insurgent
and
confessed
to
his
old
friendship
with
the
dead
federalist
the
little
group
of
friends
present
at
the
funeral
with
those
five
great
men
will
never
forget
that
touching
scene
as
you
walk
in
the
trim
cemetery
you
will
see
a
grave
purchased
in
perpetuity
a
mound
with
a
dark
wooden
cross
above
it
and
the
name
in
large
red
letters
michel
chrestien
there
is
no
other
monument
like
it
the
friends
thought
to
pay
a
tribute
to
the
sternly
simple
nature
of
the
man
by
the
simplicity
of
the
record
of
his
death
so
in
that
chilly
garret
the
fairest
dreams
of
friendship
were
realized
these
men
were
brothers
leading
lives
of
intellectual
effort
loyally
helping
each
other
making
no
reservations
not
even
of
their
worst
thoughts
men
of
vast
acquirements
natures
tried
in
the
crucible
of
poverty
once
admitted
as
an
equal
among
such
elect
souls
lucien
represented
beauty
and
poetry
they
admired
the
sonnets
which
he
read
to
them
they
would
ask
him
for
a
sonnet
as
he
would
ask
michel
chrestien
for
a
song
and
in
the
desert
of
paris
lucien
found
an
oasis
in
the
rue
des
at
the
beginning
of
october
lucien
had
spent
the
last
of
his
money
on
a
little
firewood
he
was
through
the
task
of
recasting
his
work
the
most
strenuous
of
all
toil
and
he
was
penniless
as
for
daniel
d
arthez
burning
blocks
of
spent
tan
and
facing
poverty
like
a
hero
not
a
word
of
complaint
came
from
him
he
was
as
sober
as
any
elderly
spinster
and
methodical
as
a
miser
this
courage
called
out
lucien
s
courage
he
had
only
newly
come
into
the
circle
and
shrank
with
invincible
repugnance
from
speaking
of
his
straits
one
morning
he
went
out
manuscript
in
hand
and
reached
the
rue
du
coq
he
would
sell
archer
of
charles
to
doguereau
but
doguereau
was
out
lucien
little
knew
how
indulgent
great
natures
can
be
to
the
weaknesses
of
others
every
one
of
the
friends
had
thought
of
the
peculiar
troubles
besetting
the
poetic
temperament
of
the
prostration
which
follows
upon
the
struggle
when
the
soul
has
been
overwrought
by
the
contemplation
of
that
nature
which
it
is
the
task
of
art
to
reproduce
and
strong
as
they
were
to
endure
their
own
ills
they
felt
keenly
for
lucien
s
distress
they
guessed
that
his
stock
of
money
was
failing
and
after
all
the
pleasant
evenings
spent
in
friendly
talk
and
deep
meditations
after
the
poetry
the
confidences
the
bold
flights
over
the
fields
of
thought
or
into
the
far
future
of
the
nations
yet
another
trait
was
to
prove
how
little
lucien
had
understood
these
new
friends
of
his
lucien
dear
fellow
said
daniel
you
did
not
dine
at
flicoteaux
s
yesterday
and
we
know
lucien
could
not
keep
back
the
overflowing
tears
you
showed
a
want
of
confidence
in
us
said
michel
chrestien
we
shall
chalk
that
up
over
the
chimney
and
when
we
have
scored
ten
we
will
we
have
all
of
us
found
a
bit
of
extra
work
said
bianchon
for
my
own
part
i
have
been
looking
after
a
rich
patient
for
desplein
d
arthez
has
written
an
article
for
the
chrestien
thought
of
going
out
to
sing
in
the
champs
elysees
of
an
evening
with
a
and
four
candles
but
he
found
a
pamphlet
to
write
instead
for
a
man
who
has
a
mind
to
go
into
politics
and
gave
his
employer
six
hundred
francs
worth
of
machiavelli
leon
giraud
borrowed
fifty
francs
of
his
publisher
joseph
sold
one
or
two
sketches
and
fulgence
s
piece
was
given
on
sunday
and
there
was
a
full
here
are
two
hundred
francs
said
daniel
and
let
us
say
no
more
about
why
if
he
is
not
going
to
hug
us
all
as
if
we
had
done
something
extraordinary
cried
chrestien
lucien
meanwhile
had
written
to
the
home
circle
his
letter
was
a
masterpiece
of
sensibility
and
goodwill
as
well
as
a
sharp
cry
wrung
from
him
by
distress
the
answers
which
he
received
the
next
day
will
give
some
idea
of
the
delight
that
lucien
took
in
this
living
encyclopedia
of
angelic
spirits
each
of
whom
bore
the
stamp
of
the
art
or
science
which
he
followed
sechard
to
my
dear
lucien
enclosed
herewith
is
a
bill
at
ninety
days
payable
to
your
order
for
two
hundred
francs
you
can
draw
on
metivier
paper
merchant
our
paris
correspondent
in
the
rue
serpente
my
good
lucien
we
have
absolutely
nothing
eve
has
undertaken
the
charge
of
the
and
works
at
her
task
with
such
devotion
patience
and
industry
that
i
bless
heaven
for
giving
me
such
an
angel
for
a
wife
she
herself
says
that
it
is
impossible
to
send
you
the
least
help
but
i
think
my
friend
now
that
you
are
started
in
so
promising
a
way
with
such
great
and
noble
hearts
for
your
companions
that
you
can
hardly
fail
to
reach
the
greatness
to
which
you
were
born
aided
as
you
are
by
intelligence
almost
divine
in
daniel
d
arthez
and
michel
chrestien
and
leon
giraud
and
counseled
by
meyraux
and
bianchon
and
ridal
whom
we
have
come
to
know
through
your
dear
letter
so
i
have
drawn
this
bill
without
eve
s
knowledge
and
i
will
contrive
somehow
to
meet
it
when
the
time
comes
keep
on
your
way
lucien
it
is
rough
but
it
will
be
glorious
i
can
bear
anything
but
the
thought
of
you
sinking
into
the
sloughs
of
paris
of
which
i
saw
so
much
have
sufficient
strength
of
mind
to
do
as
you
are
doing
and
keep
out
of
scrapes
and
bad
company
wild
young
fellows
and
men
of
letters
of
a
certain
stamp
whom
i
learned
to
take
at
their
just
valuation
when
i
lived
in
paris
be
a
worthy
compeer
of
the
divine
spirits
whom
we
have
learned
to
love
through
you
your
life
will
soon
meet
with
its
reward
farewell
dearest
brother
you
have
sent
transports
of
joy
to
my
heart
i
did
not
expect
such
courage
of
you
sechard
to
dear
your
letter
made
all
of
us
cry
as
for
the
noble
hearts
to
whom
your
good
angel
surely
led
you
tell
them
that
a
mother
and
a
poor
young
wife
will
pray
for
them
night
and
morning
and
if
the
most
fervent
prayers
can
reach
the
throne
of
god
surely
they
will
bring
blessings
upon
you
all
their
names
are
engraved
upon
my
heart
ah
some
day
i
shall
see
your
friends
i
will
go
to
paris
if
i
have
to
walk
the
whole
way
to
thank
them
for
their
friendship
for
you
for
to
me
the
thought
has
been
like
balm
to
smarting
wounds
we
are
working
like
day
laborers
here
dear
this
husband
of
mine
the
unknown
great
man
whom
i
love
more
and
more
every
day
as
i
discover
moment
by
moment
the
wealth
of
his
nature
leaves
the
more
and
more
to
me
why
i
guess
our
poverty
yours
and
ours
and
our
mother
s
is
heartbreaking
to
him
our
adored
david
is
a
prometheus
gnawed
by
a
vulture
a
haggard
regret
as
for
himself
noble
fellow
he
scarcely
thinks
of
himself
he
is
hoping
to
make
a
fortune
for
he
spends
his
whole
time
in
experiments
in
he
begged
me
to
take
his
place
and
look
after
the
business
and
gives
me
as
much
help
as
his
preoccupation
allows
alas
i
shall
be
a
mother
soon
that
should
have
been
a
crowning
joy
but
as
things
are
it
saddens
me
poor
mother
she
has
grown
young
again
she
has
found
strength
to
go
back
to
her
tiring
nursing
we
should
be
happy
if
it
were
not
for
these
money
cares
old
father
sechard
will
not
give
his
son
a
farthing
david
went
over
to
see
if
he
could
borrow
a
little
for
you
for
we
were
in
despair
over
your
letter
i
know
lucien
david
said
he
will
lose
his
head
and
do
something
i
gave
him
a
good
scolding
my
brother
disappoint
us
in
any
way
i
told
him
lucien
knows
that
i
should
die
of
mother
and
i
have
pawned
a
few
things
david
does
not
know
about
it
mother
will
redeem
them
as
soon
as
she
has
made
a
little
money
in
this
way
we
have
managed
to
put
together
a
hundred
francs
which
i
am
sending
you
by
the
coach
if
i
did
not
answer
your
last
letter
do
not
remember
it
against
me
dear
we
were
working
all
night
just
then
i
have
been
working
like
a
man
oh
i
had
no
idea
that
i
was
so
strong
mme
de
bargeton
is
a
heartless
woman
she
has
no
soul
even
if
she
cared
for
you
no
longer
she
owed
it
to
herself
to
use
her
influence
for
you
and
to
help
you
when
she
had
torn
you
from
us
to
plunge
you
into
that
dreadful
sea
of
paris
only
by
the
special
blessing
of
heaven
could
you
have
met
with
true
friends
there
among
those
crowds
of
men
and
innumerable
interests
she
is
not
worth
a
regret
i
used
to
wish
that
there
might
be
some
devoted
woman
always
with
you
a
second
myself
but
now
i
know
that
your
friends
will
take
my
place
and
i
am
happy
spread
your
wings
my
dear
great
genius
you
will
be
our
pride
as
well
as
our
beloved
my
darling
the
mother
wrote
i
can
only
add
my
blessing
to
all
that
your
sister
says
and
assure
you
that
you
are
more
in
my
thoughts
and
in
my
prayers
alas
than
those
whom
i
see
daily
for
some
hearts
the
absent
are
always
in
the
right
and
so
it
is
with
the
heart
of
your
so
two
days
after
the
loan
was
offered
so
graciously
lucien
repaid
it
perhaps
life
had
never
seemed
so
bright
to
him
as
at
that
moment
but
the
touch
of
in
his
joy
did
not
escape
the
delicate
sensibility
and
searching
eyes
of
his
friends
any
one
might
think
that
you
were
afraid
to
owe
us
anything
exclaimed
fulgence
oh
the
pleasure
that
he
takes
in
returning
the
money
is
a
very
serious
symptom
to
my
mind
said
michel
chrestien
it
confirms
some
observations
of
my
own
there
is
a
spice
of
vanity
in
he
is
a
poet
said
d
arthez
but
do
you
grudge
me
such
a
very
natural
feeling
asked
lucien
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
he
did
not
hide
it
said
leon
giraud
he
is
still
open
with
us
but
i
am
afraid
that
he
may
come
to
feel
shy
of
and
why
lucien
asked
we
can
read
your
thoughts
answered
joseph
bridau
there
is
a
diabolical
spirit
in
you
that
will
seek
to
justify
courses
which
are
utterly
contrary
to
our
principles
instead
of
being
a
sophist
in
theory
you
will
be
a
sophist
in
ah
i
am
afraid
of
that
said
d
arthez
you
will
carry
on
admirable
debates
in
your
own
mind
lucien
and
take
up
a
lofty
position
in
theory
and
end
by
blameworthy
actions
you
will
never
be
at
one
with
what
ground
have
you
for
these
charges
thy
vanity
dear
poet
is
so
great
that
it
intrudes
itself
even
into
thy
friendships
cried
fulgence
all
vanity
of
that
sort
is
a
symptom
of
shocking
egoism
and
egoism
poisons
oh
dear
said
lucien
you
can
not
know
how
much
i
love
you
if
you
loved
us
as
we
love
you
would
you
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
return
the
money
which
we
had
such
pleasure
in
lending
or
have
made
so
much
of
it
we
don
t
lend
here
we
give
said
joseph
bridau
roughly
don
t
think
us
unkind
dear
boy
said
michel
chrestien
we
are
looking
forward
we
are
afraid
lest
some
day
you
may
prefer
a
petty
revenge
to
the
joys
of
pure
friendship
read
goethe
s
the
great
master
s
greatest
work
and
you
will
see
how
the
loved
gorgeous
stuffs
and
banquets
and
triumph
and
applause
very
well
be
tasso
without
his
folly
perhaps
the
world
and
its
pleasures
tempt
you
stay
with
us
carry
all
the
cravings
of
vanity
into
the
world
of
imagination
transpose
folly
keep
virtue
for
daily
wear
and
let
imagination
run
riot
instead
of
doing
as
d
arthez
says
thinking
high
thoughts
and
living
beneath
lucien
hung
his
head
his
friends
were
right
i
confess
that
you
are
stronger
than
i
he
said
with
a
charming
glance
at
them
my
back
and
shoulders
are
not
made
to
bear
the
burden
of
paris
life
i
can
not
struggle
bravely
we
are
born
with
different
temperaments
and
faculties
and
you
know
better
than
i
that
faults
and
virtues
have
their
reverse
side
i
am
tired
already
i
we
will
stand
by
you
said
d
arthez
it
is
just
in
these
ways
that
a
faithful
friendship
is
of
the
help
that
i
have
just
received
is
precarious
and
every
one
of
us
is
just
as
poor
as
another
want
will
soon
overtake
me
again
chrestien
at
the
service
of
the
first
that
hires
him
can
do
nothing
with
the
publishers
bianchon
is
quite
out
of
it
d
arthez
s
booksellers
only
deal
in
scientific
and
technical
books
they
have
no
connection
with
publishers
of
new
literature
and
as
for
horace
and
fulgence
ridal
and
bridau
their
work
lies
miles
away
from
the
booksellers
there
is
no
help
for
it
i
must
make
up
my
mind
one
way
or
stick
by
us
and
make
up
your
mind
to
it
said
bianchon
bear
up
bravely
and
trust
in
hard
but
what
is
hardship
for
you
is
death
for
me
lucien
put
in
quickly
before
the
cock
crows
thrice
smiled
leon
giraud
this
man
will
betray
the
cause
of
work
for
an
idle
life
and
the
vices
of
where
has
work
brought
you
asked
lucien
laughing
when
you
start
out
from
paris
for
italy
you
don
t
find
rome
said
joseph
bridau
you
want
your
pease
to
grow
ready
buttered
for
the
conversation
ended
in
a
joke
and
they
changed
the
subject
lucien
s
friends
with
their
perspicacity
and
delicacy
of
heart
tried
to
efface
the
memory
of
the
little
quarrel
but
lucien
knew
thenceforward
that
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
deceive
them
he
soon
fell
into
despair
which
he
was
careful
to
hide
from
such
stern
mentors
as
he
imagined
them
to
be
and
the
southern
temper
that
runs
so
easily
through
the
whole
gamut
of
mental
dispositions
set
him
making
the
most
contradictory
resolutions
again
and
again
he
talked
of
making
the
plunge
into
journalism
and
time
after
time
did
his
friends
reply
with
a
mind
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
it
would
be
the
tomb
of
the
beautiful
gracious
lucien
whom
we
love
and
know
said
d
arthez
you
would
not
hold
out
for
long
between
the
two
extremes
of
toil
and
pleasure
which
make
up
a
journalist
s
life
and
resistance
is
the
very
foundation
of
virtue
you
would
be
so
delighted
to
exercise
your
power
of
life
and
death
over
the
offspring
of
the
brain
that
you
would
be
an
journalist
in
two
months
time
to
be
a
journalist
that
is
to
turn
herod
in
the
republic
of
letters
the
man
who
will
say
anything
will
end
by
sticking
at
nothing
that
was
napoleon
s
maxim
and
it
explains
but
you
would
be
with
me
would
you
not
asked
lucien
not
by
that
time
said
fulgence
if
you
were
a
journalist
you
would
no
more
think
of
us
than
the
opera
girl
in
all
her
glory
with
her
adorers
and
her
carriage
thinks
of
the
village
at
home
and
her
cows
and
her
sabots
you
could
never
resist
the
temptation
to
pen
a
witticism
though
it
should
bring
tears
to
a
friend
s
eyes
i
come
across
journalists
in
theatre
lobbies
it
makes
me
shudder
to
see
them
journalism
is
an
inferno
a
bottomless
pit
of
iniquity
and
treachery
and
lies
no
one
can
traverse
it
undefiled
unless
like
dante
he
is
protected
by
virgil
s
sacred
but
the
more
the
set
of
friends
opposed
the
idea
of
journalism
the
more
lucien
s
desire
to
know
its
perils
grew
and
tempted
him
he
began
to
debate
within
his
own
mind
was
it
not
ridiculous
to
allow
want
to
find
him
a
second
time
defenceless
he
bethought
him
of
the
failure
of
his
attempts
to
dispose
of
his
first
novel
and
felt
but
little
tempted
to
begin
a
second
how
besides
was
he
to
live
while
he
was
writing
another
romance
one
month
of
privation
had
exhausted
his
stock
of
patience
why
should
he
not
do
nobly
that
which
journalists
did
ignobly
and
without
principle
his
friends
insulted
him
with
their
doubts
he
would
convince
them
of
his
strength
of
mind
some
day
perhaps
he
would
be
of
use
to
them
he
would
be
the
herald
of
their
fame
and
what
sort
of
a
friendship
is
it
which
recoils
from
complicity
demanded
he
one
evening
of
michel
chrestien
lucien
and
leon
giraud
were
walking
home
with
their
friend
we
shrink
from
nothing
michel
chrestien
made
reply
if
you
were
so
unlucky
as
to
kill
your
mistress
i
would
help
you
to
hide
your
crime
and
could
still
respect
you
but
if
you
were
to
turn
spy
i
should
shun
you
with
abhorrence
for
a
spy
is
systematically
shameless
and
base
there
you
have
journalism
summed
up
in
a
sentence
friendship
can
pardon
error
and
the
hasty
impulse
of
passion
it
is
bound
to
be
inexorable
when
a
man
deliberately
traffics
in
his
own
soul
and
intellect
and
why
can
not
i
turn
journalist
to
sell
my
volume
of
poetry
and
the
novel
and
then
give
up
at
once
machiavelli
might
do
so
but
not
lucien
de
rubempre
said
leon
giraud
very
well
exclaimed
lucien
i
will
show
you
that
i
can
do
as
much
as
oh
cried
michel
grasping
leon
s
hand
you
have
done
it
lucien
he
continued
you
have
three
hundred
francs
in
hand
you
can
live
comfortably
for
three
months
very
well
then
work
hard
and
write
another
romance
d
arthez
and
fulgence
will
help
you
with
the
plot
you
will
improve
you
will
be
a
novelist
and
i
meanwhile
will
enter
one
of
those
of
thought
for
three
months
i
will
be
a
journalist
i
will
sell
your
books
to
some
bookseller
or
other
by
attacking
his
publications
i
will
write
the
articles
myself
i
will
get
others
for
you
we
will
organize
a
success
you
shall
be
a
great
man
and
still
remain
our
you
must
despise
me
very
much
if
you
think
that
i
should
perish
while
you
escape
said
the
poet
o
lord
forgive
him
it
is
a
child
cried
michel
chrestien
when
lucien
s
intellect
had
been
stimulated
by
the
evenings
spent
in
d
arthez
s
garret
he
had
made
some
study
of
the
jokes
and
articles
in
the
smaller
newspapers
he
was
at
least
the
equal
he
felt
of
the
wittiest
contributors
in
private
he
tried
some
mental
gymnastics
of
the
kind
and
went
out
one
morning
with
the
triumphant
idea
of
finding
some
colonel
of
such
light
skirmishers
of
the
press
and
enlisting
in
their
ranks
he
dressed
in
his
best
and
crossed
the
bridges
thinking
as
he
went
that
authors
journalists
and
men
of
letters
his
future
comrades
in
short
would
show
him
rather
more
kindness
and
disinterestedness
than
the
two
species
of
booksellers
who
had
so
dashed
his
hopes
he
should
meet
with
and
something
of
the
kindly
and
grateful
affection
which
he
found
in
the
of
the
rue
des
tormented
by
emotion
consequent
upon
the
presentiments
to
which
men
of
imagination
cling
so
fondly
half
believing
half
battling
with
their
belief
in
them
he
arrived
in
the
rue
off
the
boulevard
montmartre
before
a
house
occupied
by
the
offices
of
a
small
newspaper
he
stopped
and
at
the
sight
of
it
his
heart
began
to
throb
as
heavily
as
the
pulses
of
a
youth
upon
the
threshold
of
some
evil
haunt
nevertheless
upstairs
he
went
and
found
the
offices
in
the
low
between
the
ground
floor
and
the
first
story
the
first
room
was
divided
down
the
middle
by
a
partition
the
lower
half
of
solid
wood
the
upper
lattice
work
to
the
ceiling
in
this
apartment
lucien
discovered
a
pensioner
supporting
several
reams
of
paper
on
his
head
with
his
remaining
hand
while
between
his
teeth
he
held
the
passbook
which
the
inland
revenue
department
requires
every
newspaper
to
produce
with
each
issue
this
individual
owner
of
a
yellow
countenance
covered
with
red
excrescences
to
which
he
owed
his
nickname
of
coloquinte
indicated
a
personage
behind
the
lattice
as
the
cerberus
of
the
paper
this
was
an
elderly
officer
with
a
medal
on
his
chest
and
a
silk
on
his
head
his
nose
was
almost
hidden
by
a
pair
of
grizzled
moustaches
and
his
person
was
hidden
as
completely
in
an
ample
blue
overcoat
as
the
body
of
the
turtle
in
its
carapace
from
what
date
do
you
wish
your
subscription
to
commence
sir
inquired
the
emperor
s
officer
i
did
not
come
about
a
subscription
returned
lucien
looking
about
him
he
saw
a
placard
fastened
on
a
door
corresponding
to
the
one
by
which
he
had
entered
and
read
the
words
editor
s
office
and
below
in
smaller
letters
admittance
except
on
a
complaint
i
expect
replied
the
veteran
ah
yes
we
have
been
hard
on
mariette
what
would
you
have
i
don
t
know
the
why
and
wherefore
of
it
but
if
you
want
satisfaction
i
am
ready
for
you
he
added
glancing
at
a
collection
of
small
arms
and
foils
stacked
in
a
corner
the
armory
of
the
modern
warrior
that
was
still
further
from
my
intention
sir
i
have
come
to
speak
to
the
nobody
is
ever
here
before
four
o
look
you
here
giroudeau
old
chap
remarked
a
voice
i
make
it
eleven
columns
eleven
columns
at
five
francs
apiece
is
francs
and
i
have
only
been
paid
forty
so
you
owe
me
another
fifteen
francs
as
i
have
been
telling
these
words
proceeded
from
a
little
pallid
and
as
the
white
of
an
egg
two
slits
of
eyes
looked
out
of
it
mild
blue
in
tint
but
appallingly
malignant
in
expression
and
the
owner
an
insignificant
young
man
was
completely
hidden
by
the
veteran
s
opaque
person
it
was
a
voice
a
sound
between
the
mewing
of
a
cat
and
the
wheezy
chokings
of
a
hyena
yes
yes
my
little
militiaman
retorted
he
of
the
medal
but
you
are
counting
the
headings
and
white
lines
i
have
finot
s
instructions
to
add
up
the
totals
of
the
lines
and
to
divide
them
by
the
proper
number
for
each
column
and
after
i
performed
that
concentrating
operation
on
your
copy
there
were
three
columns
he
doesn
t
pay
for
the
blanks
the
jew
he
reckons
them
in
though
when
he
sends
up
the
total
of
his
work
to
his
partner
and
he
gets
paid
for
them
too
i
will
go
and
see
etienne
lousteau
vernou
i
can
not
go
beyond
my
orders
my
boy
said
the
veteran
what
do
you
cry
out
against
your
for
a
matter
of
fifteen
francs
you
that
turn
out
an
article
as
easily
as
i
smoke
a
cigar
fifteen
francs
why
you
will
give
a
bowl
of
punch
to
your
friends
or
win
an
extra
game
of
billiards
and
there
s
an
end
of
it
finot
s
savings
will
cost
him
very
dear
said
the
contributor
as
he
took
his
departure
now
would
not
anybody
think
that
he
was
rousseau
and
voltaire
rolled
in
one
the
cashier
remarked
to
himself
as
he
glanced
at
lucien
i
will
come
in
again
at
four
sir
said
lucien
while
the
argument
proceeded
lucien
had
been
looking
about
him
he
saw
upon
the
walls
the
portraits
of
benjamin
constant
general
foy
and
the
seventeen
illustrious
orators
of
the
left
interspersed
with
caricatures
at
the
expense
of
the
government
but
he
looked
more
particularly
at
the
door
of
the
sanctuary
where
no
doubt
the
paper
was
elaborated
the
witty
paper
that
amused
him
daily
and
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
ridiculing
kings
and
the
most
portentous
events
of
calling
anything
and
everything
in
question
with
a
jest
then
he
sauntered
along
the
boulevards
it
was
an
entirely
novel
amusement
and
so
agreeable
did
he
find
it
that
looking
at
the
turret
clocks
he
saw
the
hour
hands
were
pointing
to
four
and
only
then
remembered
that
he
had
not
breakfasted
he
went
at
once
in
the
direction
of
the
rue
climbed
the
stair
and
opened
the
door
the
veteran
officer
was
absent
but
the
old
pensioner
sitting
on
a
pile
of
stamped
papers
was
munching
a
crust
and
acting
as
sentinel
resignedly
coloquinte
was
as
much
accustomed
to
his
work
in
the
office
as
to
the
fatigue
duty
of
former
days
understanding
as
much
or
as
little
about
it
as
the
why
and
wherefore
of
forced
marches
made
by
the
emperor
s
orders
lucien
was
inspired
with
the
bold
idea
of
deceiving
that
formidable
functionary
he
settled
his
hat
on
his
head
and
walked
into
the
editor
s
office
as
if
he
were
quite
at
home
looking
eagerly
about
him
he
beheld
a
round
table
covered
with
a
green
cloth
and
chairs
newly
reseated
with
straw
the
colored
brick
floor
had
not
been
waxed
but
it
was
clean
so
clean
that
the
public
evidently
seldom
entered
the
room
there
was
a
mirror
above
the
and
on
the
ledge
below
amid
a
sprinkling
of
stood
a
shopkeeper
s
clock
smothered
with
dust
and
a
couple
of
candlesticks
with
tallow
dips
thrust
into
their
sockets
a
few
antique
newspapers
lay
on
the
table
beside
an
inkstand
containing
some
black
substance
and
a
collection
of
quill
pens
twisted
into
stars
sundry
dirty
scraps
of
paper
covered
with
almost
undecipherable
hieroglyphs
proved
to
be
manuscript
articles
torn
across
the
top
by
the
compositor
to
check
off
the
sheets
as
they
were
set
up
he
admired
a
few
rather
clever
caricatures
sketched
on
bits
of
brown
paper
by
somebody
who
evidently
had
tried
to
kill
time
by
killing
something
else
to
keep
his
hand
in
other
works
of
art
were
pinned
in
the
cheap
these

of
nine
illustrations
for
the
work

attained
to
such
an
european
popularity
that
journalists
evidently
were
tired
of
the
solitary

his
first
appearance
in
the
provinces
sensation
among
the
the
solitary
perused
at
a
effect
of
the
solitary
on
domestic
the
solitary
explained
to
savage
tribes
with
the
most
brilliant
the
solitary
translated
into
chinese
and
presented
by
the
author
to
the
emperor
at
the
mont
sauvage
rape
of
lucien
though
this
caricature
very
shocking
but
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
it
the
solitary
under
a
canopy
conducted
in
triumphal
procession
by
the
the
solitary

the
press
to
splinters
and
wounds
the
read
backwards
the
superior
beauties
of
the
solitary
produce
a
sensation
at
the
on
a
lucien
noticed
a
sketch
of
a
contributor
holding
out
his
hat
and
beneath
it
the
words
finot
my
hundred
francs
and
a
name
since
grown
more
notorious
than
famous
between
the
window
and
the
stood
a
a
mahogany
armchair
and
a
basket
on
a
strip
of
the
dust
lay
thick
on
all
these
objects
there
were
short
curtains
in
the
windows
about
a
score
of
new
books
lay
on
the
deposited
there
apparently
during
the
day
together
with
prints
music
of
the
charter
pattern
a
copy
of
the
ninth
edition
of
the
great
joke
of
the
moment
and
some
ten
unopened
letters
lucien
had
taken
stock
of
this
strange
furniture
and
made
reflections
of
the
most
exhaustive
kind
upon
it
when
the
clock
striking
five
he
returned
to
question
the
pensioner
coloquinte
had
finished
his
crust
and
was
waiting
with
the
patience
of
a
commissionaire
for
the
man
of
medals
who
perhaps
was
taking
an
airing
on
the
boulevard
at
this
conjuncture
the
rustle
of
a
dress
sounded
on
the
stair
and
the
light
unmistakable
footstep
of
a
woman
on
the
threshold
the
newcomer
was
passably
pretty
she
addressed
herself
to
lucien
sir
she
said
i
know
why
you
cry
up
mlle
virginie
s
hats
so
much
and
i
have
come
to
put
down
my
name
for
a
year
s
subscription
in
the
first
place
but
tell
me
your
conditions
i
am
not
connected
with
the
paper
oh
a
subscription
dating
from
october
inquired
the
pensioner
what
does
the
lady
want
to
know
asked
the
veteran
reappearing
on
the
scene
the
fair
milliner
and
the
retired
military
man
were
soon
deep
in
converse
and
when
lucien
beginning
to
lose
patience
came
back
to
the
first
room
he
heard
the
conclusion
of
the
matter
why
i
shall
be
delighted
quite
delighted
sir
mlle
florentine
can
come
to
my
shop
and
choose
anything
she
likes
ribbons
are
in
my
department
so
it
is
all
quite
settled
you
will
say
no
more
about
virginie
a
botcher
that
can
not
design
a
new
shape
while
i
have
ideas
of
my
own
i
lucien
heard
a
sound
as
of
coins
dropping
into
a
cashbox
and
the
veteran
began
to
make
up
his
books
for
the
day
i
have
been
waiting
here
for
an
hour
sir
lucien
began
looking
not
a
little
annoyed
and
they
have
not
come
yet
exclaimed
napoleon
s
veteran
civilly
feigning
concern
i
am
not
surprised
at
that
it
is
some
time
since
i
have
seen
them
here
it
is
the
middle
of
the
month
you
see
those
fine
fellows
only
turn
up
on
pay
days
the
or

finot
asked
lucien
having
caught
the
editor

name

is
in
the
rue
feydeau
that

where
he
lives
coloquinte

to
himself

the

received
the
rest
of
the
stamp
money

o

at

sir
these

oh
he
would
have
cleared
them
out
with
four
men
and
a
corporal
they
would
not
have
come
over
with
their
talk
but
that
is
enough
of
prattling
if
my
nephew
finds
it
worth
his
while
and
so
long
as
they
write
for
the
son
of
the
other
broum
broum
after
all
there
is
no
harm
in
that
ah
by
the
way
subscribers
don
t
seem
to
me
to
be
advancing
in
serried
columns
i
shall
leave
my
you
seem
to
know
all
about
the
newspaper
sir
lucien
began
from
a
business
point
of
view
broum
broum
coughed
the
soldier
clearing
his
throat
from
three
to
five
francs
per
column
according
to
fifty
lines
to
a
column
forty
letters
to
a
line
no
blanks
there
you
are
as
for
the
staff
they
are
queer
fish
little
youngsters
whom
i
wouldn
t
take
on
for
the
commissariat
and
because
they
make
fly
tracks
on
sheets
of
white
paper
they
look
down
forsooth
on
an
old
captain
of
dragoons
of
the
guard
that
retired
with
a
major
s
rank
after
entering
every
european
capital
with
the
soldier
of
napoleon
brushed
his
coat
and
made
as
if
he
would
go
out
but
lucien
swept
to
the
door
had
courage
enough
to
make
a
stand
i
came
to
be
a
contributor
of
the
paper
he
said
i
am
full
of
respect
i
vow
and
declare
for
a
captain
of
the
imperial
guard
those
men
of
bronze
well
said
my
little
civilian
there
are
several
kinds
of
contributors
which
kind
do
you
wish
to
be
replied
the
trooper
bearing
down
on
lucien
and
descending
the
stairs
at
the
foot
of
the
flight
he
stopped
but
it
was
only
to
light
a
cigar
at
the
porter
s
box
if
any
subscribers
come
you
see
them
and
take
note
of
them
mother
simply
subscribers
never
know
anything
but
subscribers
he
added
seeing
that
lucien
followed
him
finot
is
my
nephew
he
is
the
only
one
of
my
family
that
has
done
anything
to
relieve
me
in
my
position
so
when
anybody
comes
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
finot
he
finds
old
giroudeau
captain
of
the
dragoons
of
the
guard
that
set
out
as
a
private
in
a
cavalry
regiment
in
the
army
of
the
and
was
for
five
years
to
the
first
hussars
army
of
italy
one
two
and
the
man
that
had
any
complaints
to
make
would
be
turned
off
into
the
dark
he
added
making
a
lunge
now
writers
my
boy
are
in
different
corps
there
is
the
writer
who
writes
and
draws
his
pay
there
is
the
writer
who
writes
and
gets
nothing
a
volunteer
we
call
him
and
lastly
there
is
the
writer
who
writes
nothing
and
he
is
by
no
means
the
stupidest
for
he
makes
no
mistakes
he
gives
himself
out
for
a
literary
man
he
is
on
the
paper
he
treats
us
to
dinners
he
loafs
about
the
theatres
he
keeps
an
actress
he
is
very
well
off
what
do
you
mean
to
be
the
man
that
does
good
work
and
gets
good
you
are
like
the
recruits
they
all
want
to
be
marshals
of
france
take
old
giroudeau
s
word
for
it
and
turn
right
about
in
time
and
go
and
pick
up
nails
in
the
gutter
like
that
good
fellow
yonder
you
can
tell
by
the
look
of
him
that
he
has
been
in
the
isn
t
it
a
shame
that
an
old
soldier
who
has
walked
into
the
jaws
of
death
hundreds
of
times
should
be
picking
up
old
iron
in
the
streets
of
paris
ah
god
a
mighty
twas
a
shabby
trick
to
desert
the
well
my
boy
the
individual
you
saw
this
morning
has
made
his
forty
francs
a
month
are
you
going
to
do
better
and
according
to
finot
he
is
the
cleverest
man
on
the
when
you
enlisted
in
the
did
they
talk
about
danger
very
well
very
well
go
and
see
my
nephew
finot
a
good
fellow
as
good
a
fellow
as
you
will
find
if
you
can
find
him
that
is
for
he
is
like
a
fish
always
on
the
move
in
his
way
of
business
there
is
no
writing
you
see
it
is
setting
others
to
write
that
sort
like
gallivanting
about
with
actresses
better
than
scribbling
on
sheets
of
paper
it
seems
oh
they
are
queer
customers
they
are
hope
i
may
have
the
honor
of
seeing
you
with
that
the
cashier
raised
his
formidable
loaded
cane
one
of
the
defenders
of
germainicus
and
walked
off
leaving
lucien
in
the
street
as
much
bewildered
by
this
picture
of
the
newspaper
world
as
he
had
formerly
been
by
the
practical
aspects
of
literature
at
vidal
and
porchon
s
establishment
ten
several
times
did
lucien
repair
to
the
rue
feydeau
in
search
of
andoche
finot
and
ten
times
he
failed
to
find
that
gentleman
he
went
first
thing
in
the
morning
finot
had
not
come
in
at
noon
finot
had
gone
out
he
was
breakfasting
at
such
and
such
a
cafe
at
the
cafe
in
answer
to
inquiries
of
the
waitress
made
after
surmounting
unspeakable
repugnance
lucien
heard
that
finot
had
just
left
the
place
lucien
at
length
tired
out
began
to
regard
finot
as
a
mythical
and
fabulous
character
it
appeared
simpler
to
waylay
etienne
lousteau
at
flicoteaux
s
that
youthful
journalist
would
doubtless
explain
the
mysteries
that
enveloped
the
paper
for
which
he
wrote
since
the
day
a
hundred
times
blessed
when
lucien
made
the
acquaintance
of
daniel
d
arthez
he
had
taken
another
seat
at
flicoteaux
s
the
two
friends
dined
side
by
side
talking
in
lowered
voices
of
the
higher
literature
of
suggested
subjects
and
ways
of
presenting
opening
up
and
developing
them
at
the
present
time
daniel
d
arthez
was
correcting
the
manuscript
of
archer
of
charles
he
reconstructed
whole
chapters
and
wrote
the
fine
passages
found
therein
as
well
as
the
magnificent
preface
which
is
perhaps
the
best
thing
in
the
book
and
throws
so
much
light
on
the
work
of
the
young
school
of
literature
one
day
it
so
happened
that
daniel
had
been
waiting
for
lucien
who
now
sat
with
his
friend
s
hand
in
his
own
when
he
saw
etienne
lousteau
turn
the
lucien
instantly
dropped
daniel
s
hand
and
told
the
waiter
that
he
would
dine
at
his
old
place
by
the
counter
d
arthez
gave
lucien
a
glance
of
divine
kindness
in
which
reproach
was
wrapped
in
forgiveness
the
glance
cut
the
poet
to
the
quick
he
took
daniel
s
hand
and
grasped
it
anew
it
is
an
important
question
of
business
for
me
i
will
tell
you
about
it
afterwards
said
he
lucien
was
in
his
old
place
by
the
time
that
lousteau
reached
the
table
as
the
first
comer
he
greeted
his
acquaintance
they
soon
struck
up
a
conversation
which
grew
so
lively
that
lucien
went
off
in
search
of
the
manuscript
of
the
while
lousteau
finished
his
dinner
he
had
obtained
leave
to
lay
his
sonnets
before
the
journalist
and
mistook
the
civility
of
the
latter
for
willingness
to
find
him
a
publisher
or
a
place
on
the
paper
when
lucien
came
hurrying
back
again
he
saw
d
arthez
resting
an
elbow
on
the
table
in
a
corner
of
the
restaurant
and
knew
that
his
friend
was
watching
him
with
melancholy
eyes
but
he
would
not
see
d
arthez
just
then
he
felt
the
sharp
pangs
of
poverty
the
goadings
of
ambition
and
followed
lousteau
in
the
late
afternoon
the
journalist
and
the
neophyte
went
to
the
luxembourg
and
sat
down
under
the
trees
in
that
part
of
the
gardens
which
lies
between
the
broad
avenue
de
l
observatoire
and
the
rue
de
l
ouest
the
rue
de
l
ouest
at
that
time
was
a
long
morass
bounded
by
planks
and
the
houses
were
all
at
the
end
nearest
the
rue
de
vaugirard
and
the
walk
through
the
gardens
was
so
little
frequented
that
at
the
hour
when
paris
dines
two
lovers
might
fall
out
and
exchange
the
earnest
of
reconciliation
without
fear
of
intruders
the
only
possible
was
the
pensioner
on
duty
at
the
little
iron
gate
on
the
rue
de
l
ouest
if
that
veteran
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
lengthen
his
monotonous
beat
there
on
a
bench
beneath
the
etienne
lousteau
sat
and
listened
to
from
the
etienne
lousteau
after
a
apprenticeship
was
on
the
staff
of
a
newspaper
he
had
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
he
reckoned
some
of
the
celebrities
of
the
day
among
his
friends
altogether
he
was
an
imposing
personage
in
lucien
s
eyes
wherefore
while
lucien
untied
the
string
about
the
he
judged
it
necessary
to
make
some
sort
of
preface
the
sonnet
monsieur
said
he
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
forms
of
poetry
it
has
fallen
almost
entirely
into
disuse
no
frenchman
can
hope
to
rival
petrarch
for
the
language
in
which
the
italian
wrote
being
so
infinitely
more
pliant
than
french
lends
itself
to
play
of
thought
which
our
positivism
pardon
the
use
of
the
expression
rejects
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
volume
of
sonnets
would
be
something
quite
new
victor
hugo
has
appropriated
the
old
canalis
writes
lighter
verse
beranger
has
monopolized
songs
casimir
delavigne
has
taken
tragedy
and
lamartine
the
poetry
of
are
you
a
classic
or
a
romantic
inquired
lousteau
lucien
s
astonishment
betrayed
such
complete
ignorance
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
republic
of
letters
that
lousteau
thought
it
necessary
to
enlighten
him
you
have
come
up
in
the
middle
of
a
pitched
battle
my
dear
fellow
you
must
make
your
decision
at
once
literature
is
divided
in
the
first
place
into
several
zones
but
our
great
men
are
ranged
in
two
hostile
camps
the
royalists
are
romantics
the
liberals
are
the
divergence
of
taste
in
matters
literary
and
divergence
of
political
opinion
coincide
and
the
result
is
a
war
with
weapons
of
every
sort
witticisms
subtle
calumnies
and
nicknames
between
the
rising
and
the
waning
glory
and
ink
is
shed
in
torrents
the
odd
part
of
it
is
that
the
are
all
for
liberty
in
literature
and
for
repealing
laws
and
conventions
while
the
are
for
maintaining
the
unities
the
alexandrine
and
the
classical
theme
so
opinions
in
politics
on
either
side
are
directly
at
variance
with
literary
taste
if
you
are
eclectic
you
will
have
no
one
for
you
which
side
do
you
take
which
is
the
winning
side
the
liberal
newspapers
have
far
more
subscribers
than
the
royalist
and
ministerial
journals
still
though
canalis
is
for
church
and
king
and
patronized
by
the
court
and
the
clergy
he
reaches
other
pshaw
sonnets
date
back
to
an
epoch
before
boileau
s
time
said
etienne
seeing
lucien
s
dismay
at
the
prospect
of
choosing
between
two
banners
be
a
romantic
the
romantics
are
young
men
and
the
classics
are
pedants
the
romantics
will
gain
the
the
word
pedant
was
the
latest
epithet
taken
up
by
romantic
journalism
to
heap
confusion
on
the
classical
faction
lucien
began
to
read
choosing
first
of
all
the
easter
daisies
the
daisies
in
the
meadows
not
in
vain
in
red
and
white
and
gold
before
our
eyes
have
written
an
idyll
for
man
s
sympathies
and
set
his
heart
s
desire
in
language
plain
gold
stamens
set
in
silver
filigrane
reveal
the
treasures
which
we
idolize
and
all
the
cost
of
struggle
for
the
prize
is
symboled
by
a
secret
stain
was
it
because
your
petals
once
uncurled
when
jesus
rose
upon
a
fairer
world
and
from
wings
shaken
for
a
heav
nward
flight
shed
grace
that
still
as
autumn
reappears
you
bloom
again
to
tell
of
dead
delight
to
bring
us
back
the
flower
of
twenty
years
lucien
felt
piqued
by
lousteau
s
complete
indifference
during
the
reading
of
the
sonnet
he
was
unfamiliar
as
yet
with
the
disconcerting
impassibility
of
the
professional
critic
wearied
by
much
reading
of
poetry
prose
and
plays
lucien
was
accustomed
to
applause
he
choked
down
his
disappointment
and
read
another
a
favorite
with
mme
de
bargeton
and
with
some
of
his
friends
in
the
rue
des
this
one
perhaps
will
draw
a
word
from
him
he
thought
the
marguerite
i
am
the
marguerite
fair
and
tall
i
grew
in
velvet
meadows
mid
the
flowers
a
star
they
sought
me
for
my
beauty
near
and
far
my
dawn
i
thought
should
be
for
ever
new
but
now
an
all
gift
i
rue
a
fatal
ray
of
knowledge
shed
to
mar
my
radiant
grown
oracular
for
i
must
speak
and
give
an
answer
true
an
end
of
silence
and
of
quiet
days
the
lover
with
two
words
my
counsel
prays
and
when
my
secret
from
my
heart
is
reft
when
all
my
silver
petals
scattered
lie
i
am
the
only
flower
neglected
left
cast
down
and
trodden
under
foot
to
die
at
the
end
the
poet
looked
up
at
his
aristarchus
etienne
lousteau
was
gazing
at
the
trees
in
the
pepiniere
well
asked
lucien
well
my
dear
fellow
go
on
i
am
listening
to
you
am
i
not
that
fact
in
itself
is
as
good
as
praise
in
have
you
had
enough
lucien
asked
go
on
the
other
answered
abruptly
enough
lucien
proceeded
to
read
the
following
sonnet
but
his
heart
was
dead
within
him
lousteau
s
inscrutable
composure
froze
his
utterance
if
he
had
come
a
little
further
upon
the
road
he
would
have
known
that
between
writer
and
writer
silence
or
abrupt
speech
under
such
circumstances
is
a
betrayal
of
jealousy
and
outspoken
admiration
means
a
sense
of
relief
over
the
discovery
that
the
work
is
not
above
the
average
after
all
the
camellia
in
nature
s
book
if
rightly
understood
the
rose
means
love
and
red
for
beauty
glows
a
pure
sweet
spirit
in
the
violet
blows
and
bright
the
lily
gleams
in
lowlihood
but
this
strange
bloom
by
sun
and
wind
unwooed
seems
to
expand
and
blossom
mid
the
snows
a
lily
sceptreless
a
scentless
rose
for
dainty
listlessness
of
maidenhood
yet
at
the
opera
house
the
petals
trace
for
modesty
a
fitting
aureole
an
alabaster
wreath
to
lay
methought
in
dusky
hair
o
er
some
fair
woman
s
face
which
kindles
ev
n
such
love
within
the
soul
as
sculptured
marble
forms
by
phidias
wrought
what
do
you
think
of
my
poor
sonnets
lucien
asked
coming
straight
to
the
point
do
you
want
the
truth
i
am
young
enough
to
like
the
truth
and
so
anxious
to
succeed
that
i
can
hear
it
without
taking
offence
but
not
without
despair
replied
lucien
well
my
dear
fellow
the
first
sonnet
from
its
involved
style
was
evidently
written
at
angouleme
it
gave
you
so
much
trouble
no
doubt
that
you
can
not
give
it
up
the
second
and
third
smack
of
paris
already
but
read
us
one
more
sonnet
he
added
with
a
gesture
that
seemed
charming
to
the
provincial
encouraged
by
the
request
lucien
read
with
more
confidence
choosing
a
sonnet
which
d
arthez
and
bridau
liked
best
perhaps
on
account
of
its
color
the
tulip
i
am
the
tulip
from
batavia
s
shore
the
thrifty
fleming
for
my
beauty
rare
pays
a
king
s
ransom
when
that
i
am
fair
and
tall
and
straight
and
pure
my
petal
s
core
and
like
some
yolande
of
the
days
of
yore
my
long
and
amply
folded
skirts
i
wear
o
with
the
blazon
that
i
bear
gules
a
fess
azure
purpure
fretty
or
the
fingers
of
the
gardener
divine
have
woven
for
me
my
vesture
fair
and
fine
of
threads
of
sunlight
and
of
purple
stain
no
flower
so
glorious
in
the
garden
bed
but
nature
woe
is
me
no
fragrance
shed
within
my
cup
of
orient
porcelain
well
asked
lucien
after
a
pause
immeasurably
long
as
it
seemed
to
him
my
dear
fellow
etienne
said
gravely
surveying
the
tips
of
lucien
s
boots
he
had
brought
the
pair
from
angouleme
and
was
wearing
them
out
my
dear
fellow
i
strongly
recommend
you
to
put
your
ink
on
your
boots
to
save
blacking
and
to
take
your
pens
for
toothpicks
so
that
when
you
come
away
from
flicoteaux
s
you
can
swagger
along
this
picturesque
alley
looking
as
if
you
had
dined
get
a
situation
of
any
sort
or
description
run
errands
for
a
bailiff
if
you
have
the
heart
be
a
shopman
if
your
back
is
strong
enough
enlist
if
you
happen
to
have
a
taste
for
military
music
you
have
the
stuff
of
three
poets
in
you
but
before
you
can
reach
your
public
you
will
have
time
to
die
of
starvation
six
times
over
if
you
intend
to
live
on
the
proceeds
of
your
poetry
that
is
and
from
your
too
unsophisticated
discourse
it
would
seem
to
be
your
intention
to
coin
money
out
of
your
inkstand
i
say
nothing
as
to
your
verses
they
are
a
good
deal
better
than
all
the
poetical
wares
that
are
cumbering
the
ground
in
booksellers
backshops
just
now
elegant
nightingales
of
that
sort
cost
a
little
more
than
the
others
because
they
are
printed
on
paper
but
they
nearly
all
of
them
come
down
at
last
to
the
banks
of
the
seine
you
may
study
their
range
of
notes
there
any
day
if
you
care
to
make
an
instructive
pilgrimage
along
the
quais
from
old
jerome
s
stall
by
the
pont
notre
dame
to
the
pont
royal
you
will
find
them
all
there
all
the
in
the
the
lofty
flights
the
hymns
and
songs
and
ballads
and
odes
all
the
nestfuls
hatched
during
the
last
seven
years
in
fact
there
lie
their
muses
thick
with
dust
bespattered
by
every
passing
cab
at
the
mercy
of
every
profane
hand
that
turns
them
over
to
look
at
the
vignette
on
the
you
know
nobody
you
have
access
to
no
newspaper
so
your
will
remain
demurely
folded
as
you
hold
them
now
they
will
never
open
out
to
the
sun
of
publicity
in
fair
fields
with
broad
margins
enameled
with
the
florets
which
dauriat
the
illustrious
the
king
of
the
wooden
galleries
scatters
with
a
lavish
hand
for
poets
known
to
fame
i
came
to
paris
as
you
came
poor
boy
with
a
plentiful
stock
of
illusions
impelled
by
irrepressible
longings
for
glory
and
i
found
the
realities
of
the
craft
the
practical
difficulties
of
the
trade
the
hard
facts
of
poverty
in
my
enthusiasm
it
is
kept
well
under
control
now
my
first
ebullition
of
youthful
spirits
i
did
not
see
the
social
machinery
at
work
so
i
had
to
learn
to
see
it
by
bumping
against
the
wheels
and
bruising
myself
against
the
shafts
and
chains
now
you
are
about
to
learn
as
i
learned
that
between
you
and
all
these
fair
things
lies
the
strife
of
men
and
passions
and
necessities
you
must
take
part
in
a
terrible
battle
book
against
book
man
against
man
party
against
party
make
war
you
must
and
that
systematically
or
you
will
be
abandoned
by
your
own
party
and
they
are
mean
contests
struggles
which
leave
you
disenchanted
and
wearied
and
depraved
and
all
in
pure
waste
for
it
often
happens
that
you
put
forth
all
your
strength
to
win
laurels
for
a
man
whom
you
despise
and
maintain
in
spite
of
yourself
that
some
writer
is
a
genius
there
is
a
world
behind
the
scenes
in
the
theatre
of
literature
the
public
in
front
sees
unexpected
or
success
and
applauds
the
public
does
see
the
preparations
ugly
as
they
always
are
the
painted
supers
the
hired
to
applaud
the
stage
carpenters
and
all
that
lies
behind
the
scenes
you
are
still
among
the
audience
abdicate
there
is
still
time
before
you
set
your
foot
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
throne
for
which
so
many
ambitious
spirits
are
contending
and
do
not
sell
your
honor
as
i
do
for
a
etienne
s
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
spoke
do
you
know
how
i
make
a
living
he
continued
passionately
the
little
stock
of
money
they
gave
me
at
home
was
soon
eaten
up
a
piece
of
mine
was
accepted
at
the
just
as
i
came
to
an
end
of
it
at
the
the
influence
of
a
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
or
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
would
not
be
enough
to
secure
a
turn
of
favor
the
actors
only
make
concessions
to
those
who
threaten
their
if
it
is
in
your
power
to
spread
a
report
that
the
has
the
asthma
the
leading
lady
a
fistula
where
you
please
and
the
soubrette
has
foul
breath
then
your
piece
would
be
played
i
do
not
know
whether
in
two
years
time
i
who
speak
to
you
now
shall
be
in
a
position
to
exercise
such
power
you
need
so
many
to
back
you
and
where
and
how
am
i
to
gain
my
bread
meanwhile
i
tried
lots
of
things
i
wrote
a
novel
anonymously
old
doguereau
gave
me
two
hundred
francs
for
it
and
he
did
not
make
very
much
out
of
it
himself
then
it
grew
plain
to
me
that
journalism
alone
could
give
me
a
living
the
next
thing
was
to
find
my
way
into
those
shops
i
will
not
tell
you
all
the
advances
i
made
nor
how
often
i
begged
in
vain
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
six
months
i
spent
as
extra
hand
on
a
paper
and
was
told
that
i
scared
subscribers
away
when
as
a
fact
i
attracted
them
pass
over
the
insults
i
put
up
with
at
this
moment
i
am
doing
the
plays
at
the
boulevard
theatres
almost
for
a
paper
belonging
to
finot
that
stout
young
fellow
who
breakfasts
two
or
three
times
a
month
even
now
at
the
cafe
voltaire
but
you
don
t
go
there
i
live
by
selling
tickets
that
managers
give
me
to
bribe
a
good
word
in
the
paper
and
reviewers
copies
of
books
in
short
finot
once
satisfied
i
am
allowed
to
write
for
and
against
various
commercial
articles
and
i
traffic
in
tribute
paid
in
kind
by
various
tradesmen
a
facetious
notice
of
a
carminative
toilet
lotion
des
cephalic
oil
or
brazilian
mixture
brings
me
in
twenty
or
thirty
francs
i
am
obliged
to
dun
the
publishers
when
they
don
t
send
in
a
sufficient
number
of
reviewers
copies
finot
as
editor
appropriates
two
and
sells
them
and
i
must
have
two
to
sell
if
a
book
of
capital
importance
comes
out
and
the
publisher
is
stingy
with
copies
his
life
is
made
a
burden
to
him
the
craft
is
vile
but
i
live
by
it
and
so
do
scores
of
others
do
not
imagine
that
things
are
any
better
in
public
life
there
is
corruption
everywhere
in
both
regions
every
man
is
corrupt
or
corrupts
others
if
there
is
any
publishing
enterprise
somewhat
larger
than
usual
afoot
the
trade
will
pay
me
something
to
buy
neutrality
the
amount
of
my
income
varies
therefore
directly
with
the
prospectuses
when
prospectuses
break
out
like
a
rash
money
pours
into
my
pockets
i
stand
treat
all
round
when
trade
is
dull
i
dine
at
flicoteaux
s
actresses
will
pay
you
likewise
for
praise
but
the
wiser
among
them
pay
for
criticism
to
be
passed
over
in
silence
is
what
they
dread
the
most
and
the
very
best
thing
of
all
from
their
point
of
view
is
criticism
which
draws
down
a
reply
it
is
far
more
effectual
than
bald
praise
forgotten
as
soon
as
read
and
it
costs
more
in
consequence
celebrity
my
dear
fellow
is
based
upon
controversy
i
am
a
hired
bravo
i
ply
my
trade
among
ideas
and
reputations
commercial
literary
and
dramatic
i
make
some
fifty
crowns
a
month
i
can
sell
a
novel
for
five
hundred
francs
and
i
am
beginning
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
man
to
be
feared
some
day
instead
of
living
with
florine
at
the
expense
of
a
druggist
who
gives
himself
the
airs
of
a
lord
i
shall
be
in
a
house
of
my
own
i
shall
be
on
the
staff
of
a
leading
newspaper
i
shall
have
a
and
on
that
day
my
dear
fellow
florine
will
become
a
great
actress
as
for
me
i
am
not
sure
what
i
shall
be
when
that
time
comes
a
minister
or
an
honest
man
all
things
are
still
he
raised
his
humiliated
head
and
looked
out
at
the
green
leaves
with
an
expression
of
despairing
dreadful
to
see
and
i
had
a
great
tragedy
accepted
he
went
on
and
among
my
papers
there
is
a
poem
which
will
die
and
i
was
a
good
fellow
and
my
heart
was
clean
i
used
to
dream
lofty
dreams
of
love
for
great
ladies
queens
in
the
great
world
and
my
mistress
is
an
actress
at
the
and
lastly
if
a
bookseller
declines
to
send
a
copy
of
a
book
to
my
paper
i
will
run
down
work
which
is
good
as
i
lucien
was
moved
to
tears
and
he
grasped
etienne
s
hand
in
his
the
journalist
rose
to
his
feet
and
the
pair
went
up
and
down
the
broad
avenue
de
l
observatoire
as
if
their
lungs
craved
ampler
breathing
space
outside
the
world
of
letters
etienne
lousteau
continued
not
a
single
creature
suspects
that
every
one
who
succeeds
in
that
world
who
has
a
certain
vogue
that
is
to
say
or
comes
into
fashion
or
gains
reputation
or
renown
or
fame
or
favor
with
the
public
for
by
these
names
we
know
the
rungs
of
the
ladder
by
which
we
climb
to
the
higher
heights
above
and
beyond
them
every
one
who
comes
even
thus
far
is
the
hero
of
a
dreadful
odyssey
brilliant
portents
rise
above
the
mental
horizon
through
a
combination
of
a
thousand
accidents
conditions
change
so
swiftly
that
no
two
men
have
been
known
to
reach
success
by
the
same
road
canalis
and
nathan
are
two
dissimilar
cases
things
never
fall
out
in
the
same
way
twice
there
is
d
arthez
who
knocks
himself
to
pieces
with
work
he
will
make
a
famous
name
by
some
other
chance
this
so
much
desired
reputation
is
nearly
always
crowned
prostitution
yes
the
poorest
kind
of
literature
is
the
hapless
creature
freezing
at
the
street
corner
literature
is
the
picked
out
of
the
brothels
of
journalism
and
i
am
her
bully
lastly
there
is
lucky
literature
the
flaunting
insolent
courtesan
who
has
a
house
of
her
own
and
pays
taxes
who
receives
great
lords
treating
or
them
as
she
pleases
who
has
liveried
servants
and
a
carriage
and
can
afford
to
keep
greedy
creditors
waiting
ah
and
for
yet
others
for
me
not
so
very
long
ago
for
you
she
is
a
angel
with
wings
bearing
a
green
palm
branch
in
the
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
flaming
sword
an
angel
something
akin
to
the
mythological
abstraction
which
lives
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
and
to
the
poor
and
honest
girl
who
lives
a
life
of
exile
in
the
outskirts
of
the
great
city
earning
every
penny
with
a
noble
fortitude
and
in
the
full
light
of
virtue
returning
to
heaven
inviolate
of
body
and
soul
unless
indeed
she
comes
to
lie
at
the
last
soiled
despoiled
polluted
and
forgotten
on
a
pauper
s
bier
as
for
the
men
whose
brains
are
encompassed
with
bronze
whose
hearts
are
still
warm
under
the
snows
of
experience
they
are
found
but
seldom
in
the
country
that
lies
at
our
feet
he
added
pointing
to
the
great
city
seething
in
the
late
afternoon
light
a
vision
of
d
arthez
and
his
friends
flashed
upon
lucien
s
sight
and
made
appeal
to
him
for
a
moment
but
lousteau
s
appalling
lamentation
carried
him
away
they
are
very
few
and
far
between
in
that
great
fermenting
vat
rare
as
love
in
rare
as
fortunes
honestly
made
in
business
rare
as
the
journalist
whose
hands
are
clean
the
experience
of
the
first
man
who
told
me
all
that
i
am
telling
you
was
thrown
away
upon
me
and
mine
no
doubt
will
be
wasted
upon
you
it
is
always
the
same
old
story
year
after
year
the
same
eager
rush
to
paris
from
the
provinces
the
same
not
to
say
a
growing
number
of
beardless
ambitious
boys
who
advance
head
erect
and
the
heart
that
princess
tourandocte
of
the
et
un
each
one
of
them
fain
to
be
her
prince
calaf
but
never
a
one
of
them
reads
the
riddle
one
by
one
they
drop
some
into
the
trench
where
failures
lie
some
into
the
mire
of
journalism
some
again
into
the
quagmires
of
the
they
pick
up
a
living
these
beggars
what
with
biographical
notices
and
scraps
of
news
for
the
papers
they
become
booksellers
hacks
for
the
dealers
in
printed
paper
who
would
sooner
take
the
rubbish
that
goes
off
in
a
fortnight
than
a
masterpiece
which
requires
time
to
sell
the
life
is
crushed
out
of
the
grubs
before
they
reach
the
butterfly
stage
they
live
by
shame
and
dishonor
they
are
ready
to
write
down
a
rising
genius
or
to
praise
him
to
the
skies
at
a
word
from
the
pasha
of
the
the
or
the
at
a
sign
from
a
publisher
at
the
request
of
a
jealous
comrade
or
as
not
seldom
happens
simply
for
a
dinner
some
surmount
the
obstacles
and
these
forget
the
misery
of
their
early
days
i
who
am
telling
you
this
have
been
putting
the
best
that
is
in
me
into
newspaper
articles
for
six
months
past
for
a
blackguard
who
gives
them
out
as
his
own
and
has
secured
a
in
another
paper
on
the
strength
of
them
he
has
not
taken
me
on
as
his
collaborator
he
has
not
give
me
so
much
as
a
piece
but
i
hold
out
a
hand
to
grasp
his
when
we
meet
i
can
not
help
and
why
lucien
asked
indignantly
i
may
want
to
put
a
dozen
lines
into
his
some
day
lousteau
answered
coolly
in
short
my
dear
fellow
in
literature
you
will
not
make
money
by
hard
work
that
is
not
the
secret
of
success
the
point
is
to
exploit
the
work
of
somebody
else
a
newspaper
proprietor
is
a
contractor
we
are
the
bricklayers
the
more
mediocre
the
man
the
better
his
chance
of
getting
on
among
mediocrities
he
can
play
the
put
up
with
any
treatment
and
flatter
all
the
little
base
passions
of
the
sultans
of
literature
there
is
hector
merlin
who
came
from
limoges
a
short
time
ago
he
is
writing
political
articles
already
for
a
right
centre
daily
and
he
is
at
work
on
our
little
paper
as
well
i
have
seen
an
editor
drop
his
hat
and
merlin
pick
it
up
the
fellow
was
careful
never
to
give
offence
and
slipped
into
the
thick
of
the
fight
between
rival
ambitions
i
am
sorry
for
you
it
is
as
if
i
saw
in
you
the
self
that
i
used
to
be
and
sure
am
i
that
in
one
or
two
years
time
you
will
be
what
i
am
you
will
think
that
there
is
some
lurking
jealousy
or
personal
motive
in
this
bitter
counsel
but
it
is
prompted
by
the
despair
of
a
damned
soul
that
can
never
leave
no
one
ventures
to
utter
such
things
as
these
you
hear
the
groans
of
anguish
from
a
man
wounded
to
the
heart
crying
like
a
second
job
from
the
ashes
behold
my
sores
but
whether
i
fight
upon
this
field
or
elsewhere
fight
i
must
said
lucien
then
be
sure
of
this
returned
lousteau
if
you
have
anything
in
you
the
war
will
know
no
truce
the
best
chance
of
success
lies
in
an
empty
head
the
austerity
of
your
conscience
clear
as
yet
will
relax
when
you
see
that
a
man
holds
your
future
in
his
two
hands
when
a
word
from
such
a
man
means
life
to
you
and
he
will
not
say
that
word
for
believe
me
the
most
brutal
bookseller
in
the
trade
is
not
so
insolent
so
to
a
newcomer
as
the
celebrity
of
the
day
the
bookseller
sees
a
possible
loss
of
money
while
the
writer
of
books
dreads
a
possible
rival
the
first
shows
you
the
door
the

crushes
the
life
out
of
you
to
do
really
good
work
my

means
that
you
will
draw
out
the
energy
sap
and
tenderness
of
your
nature
at
every
dip
of
the
pen
in
the
ink
to
set
it
forth
for
the
world
in
passion
and
sentiment
and
phrases
yes
instead
of
acting
you
will
write
you
will
sing
songs
instead
of
fighting
you
will
love
and
hate
and
live
in
your
books
and
then
after
all
when
you
shall
have
reserved
your
riches
for
your
style
your
gold
and
purple
for
your
characters
and
you
yourself
are
walking
the
streets
of
paris
in
rags
rejoicing
in
that
rivaling
the
state
register
you
have
authorized
the
existence
of
beings
styled
adolphe
corinne
or
clarissa
rene
or
manon
when
you
shall
have
spoiled
your
life
and
your
digestion
to
give
life
to
that
creation
then
you
shall
see
it
slandered
betrayed
sold
swept
away
into
the
back
waters
of
oblivion
by
journalists
and
buried
out
of
sight
by
your
best
friends
how
can
you
afford
to
wait
until
the
day
when
your
creation
shall
rise
again

beginning

his

somebody
bold
enough
to
print
the
not
to

for
them
but
simply
to
print
them
and
you
will
see
some
queer
the
fierce
tirade
delivered
in
every
tone
of
the
passionate
feeling
which
it
expressed
fell
upon
lucien
s
spirit
like
an
avalanche
and
left
a
sense
of
glacial
cold
for
one
moment
he
stood
silent
then
as
he
felt
the
terrible
stimulating
charm
of
difficulty
beginning
to
work
upon
him
his
courage
blazed
up
he
grasped
lousteau

said
lucien
bring
your
manuscript
with
you
and
be
careful
of
your
dress
not
on
florine
s
account
but
for
the
booksellers
the
comrade
s
following
upon
the
poet
s
passionate
outcry
as
he
described
the
war
of
letters
moved
lucien
quite
as
deeply
as
d
arthez
s
grave
and
earnest
words
on
a
former
occasion
the
prospect
of
entering
at
once
upon
the
strife
with
men
warmed
him
in
his
youth
and
inexperience
he
had
no
suspicion
how
real
were
the
moral
evils
denounced
by
the
journalist
nor
did
he
know
that
he
was
standing
at
the
parting
of
two
distinct
ways
between
two
systems
represented
by
the
brotherhood
upon
one
hand
and
journalism
upon
the
other
the
first
way
was
long
honorable
and
sure
the
second
beset
with
hidden
dangers
a
perilous
path
among
muddy
channels
where
conscience
is
inevitably
bespattered
the
bent
of
lucien
s
character
determined
for
the
shorter
way
and
the
apparently
pleasanter
way
and
to
snatch
at
the
quickest
and
promptest
means
at
this
moment
he
saw
no
difference
between
d
arthez
s
noble
friendship
and
lousteau
s
easy
comaraderie
his
inconstant
mind
discerned
a
new
weapon
in
journalism
he
felt
that
he
could
wield
it
so
he
wished
to
take
it
he
was
dazzled
by
the
offers
of
this
new
friend
who
had
struck
a
hand
in
his
in
an
easy
way
which
charmed
lucien
how
should
he
know
that
while
every
man
in
the
army
of
the
press
needs
friends
every
leader
needs
men
lousteau
seeing
that
lucien
was
resolute
enlisted
him
as
a
recruit
and
hoped
to
attach
him
to
himself
the
relative
positions
of
the
two
were
similar
one
hoped
to
become
a
corporal
the
other
to
enter
the
ranks
lucien
went
back
gaily
to
his
lodgings
he
was
as
careful
over
his
toilet
as
on
that
former
unlucky
occasion
when
he
occupied
the
marquise
d
espard
s
box
but
he
had
learned
by
this
time
how
to
wear
his
clothes
with
a
better
grace
they
looked
as
though
they
belonged
to
him
he
wore
his
best
trousers
and
a
his
boots
a
very
elegant
pair
adorned
with
tassels
had
cost
him
forty
francs
his
thick
fine
golden
hair
was
scented
and
crimped
into
bright
rippling
curls
and
belief
in
his
future
lighted
up
his
forehead
he
paid
careful
attention
to
his
almost
feminine
hands
the
filbert
nails
were
a
spotless
pink
and
the
white
contours
of
his
chin
were
dazzling
by
contrast
with
a
black
satin
stock
never
did
a
more
beautiful
youth
come
down
from
the
hills
of
the
latin
quarter
glorious
as
a
greek
god
lucien
took
a
cab
and
reached
the
cafe
servel
at
a
quarter
to
seven
there
the
portress
gave
him
some
tolerably
complicated
directions
for
the
ascent
of
four
pairs
of
stairs
provided
with
these
instructions
he
discovered
not
without
difficulty
an
open
door
at
the
end
of
a
long
dark
passage
and
in
another
moment
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
traditional
room
of
the
latin
quarter
a
young
man
s
poverty
follows
him
wherever
he
goes
into
the
rue
de
la
harpe
as
into
the
rue
de
cluny
into
d
arthez
s
room
into
chrestien
s
lodging
yet
everywhere
no
less
the
poverty
has
its
own
peculiar
characteristics
due
to
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
sufferer
poverty
in
this
case
wore
a
sinister
look
a
shabby
cheap
carpet
lay
in
wrinkles
at
the
foot
of
a
curtainless
bedstead
dingy
curtains
begrimed
with
cigar
smoke
and
fumes
from
a
smoky
chimney
hung
in
the
windows
a
carcel
lamp

so
far
escaped
the
pawnbroker
add
a
chest
of
drawers
and
a
table
littered
with
papers
and
disheveled
quill
pens
and
the
list
of
furniture
was
almost
complete
all
the
books
had
evidently
arrived
in
the
course
of
the
last
hours
and
there
was
not
a
single
object
of
any
value
in
the
room
in
one
corner
you
beheld
a
collection
of
crushed
and
flattened
cigars
coiled
shirts
which
had
been
turned
to
do
double
duty
and
cravats
that
had
reached
a
third
edition
while
a
sordid
array
of
old
boots
stood
gaping
in
another
angle
of
the
room
among
aged
socks
worn
into
lace
the
room
in
short
was
a
journalist
s
bivouac
filled
with
odds
and
ends
of
no
value
and
the
most
curiously
bare
apartment
imaginable
a
scarlet
glowed
among
a
pile
of
books
on
the
nightstand
a
brace
of
pistols
a
box
of
cigars
and
a
stray
razor
lay
upon
the
a
pair
of
foils
crossed
under
a
wire
mask
hung
against
a
panel
three
chairs
and
a
couple
of
armchairs
scarcely
fit
for
the
shabbiest
in
the
street
completed
the
inventory
the
dirty
cheerless
room
told
a
tale
of
a
restless
life
and
a
want
of
some
one
came
hither
to
sleep
and
work
at
high
pressure
staying
no
longer
than
he
could
help
longing
while
he
remained
to
be
out
and
away
what
a
difference
between
this
cynical
disorder
and
d
arthez
s
neat
and
poverty
a
warning
came
with
the
thought
of
d
arthez
but
lucien
would
not
heed
it
for
etienne
made
a
joking
remark
to
cover
the
nakedness
of
a
reckless
life
this
is
my
kennel
i
appear
in
state
in
the
rue
de
bondy
in
the
new
apartments
which
our
druggist
has
taken
for
florine
we
hold
the
this
etienne
lousteau
wore
black
trousers
and
boots
his
coat
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
he
probably
meant
to
change
his
linen
at
florine
s
house
for
his
shirt
collar
was
hidden
by
a
velvet
stock
he
was
trying
to
renovate
his
hat
by
an
application
of
the
brush
let
us
go
said
lucien
not
yet
i
am
waiting
for
a
bookseller
to
bring
me
some
money
i
have
not
a
farthing
there
will
be
play
perhaps
and
in
any
case
i
must
have
as
he
spoke
the
two
new
friends
heard
a
man
s
step
in
the
passage
outside
there
he
is
said
lousteau
now
you
will
see
my
dear
fellow
the
shape
that
providence
takes
when
he
manifests
himself
to
poets
you
are
going
to
behold
dauriat
the
fashionable
bookseller
of
the
quai
des
augustins
the
pawnbroker
the
marine
store
dealer
of
the
trade
the
norman
come
along
old
tartar
shouted
lousteau
here
am
i
said
a
voice
like
a
cracked
bell
brought
the
money
with
you
money
there
is
no
money
now
in
the
trade
retorted
the
other
a
young
man
who
eyed
lucien
curiously
you
owe
me
fifty
francs
lousteau
continued
there
are
two
copies
of
in
here
a
marvel
so
they
say
swarming
with
woodcuts
sure
to
sell
finot
has
been
paid
for
two
reviews
that
i
am
to
write
for
him
two
works
just
out
by
victor
ducange
a
novelist
highly
thought
of
in
the
marais
a
couple
of
copies
of
a
second
work
by
paul
de
kock
a
beginner
in
the
same
style
two
copies
of
of
a
charming
provincial
work
total
one
hundred
francs
my
little
barbet
made
a
close
survey
of
edges
and
binding
oh
they
are
in
perfect
condition
cried
lousteau
the
are
uncut
so
is
the
paul
de
kock
so
is
the
ducange
so
is
that
other
thing
on
the
on
i
will
throw
that
in
myths
weary
me
to
that
degree
that
i
will
let
you
have
the
thing
to
spare
myself
the
sight
of
the
swarms
of
mites
coming
out
of
but
asked
lucien
how
are
you
going
to
write
your
reviews
barbet
in
profound
astonishment
stared
at
lucien
then
he
looked
at
etienne
and
chuckled
one
can
see
that
the
gentleman
has
not
the
misfortune
to
be
a
literary
man
said
he
no
barbet
no
he
is
a
poet
a
great
poet
he
is
going
to
cut
out
canalis
and
beranger
and
delavigne
he
will
go
a
long
way
if
he
does
not
throw
himself
into
the
river
and
even
so
he
will
get
as
far
as
the
at
if
i
had
any
advice
to
give
the
gentleman
remarked
barbet
it
would
be
to
give
up
poetry
and
take
to
prose
poetry
is
not
wanted
on
the
quais
just
barbet
s
shabby
overcoat
was
fastened
by
a
single
button
his
collar
was
greasy
he
kept
his
hat
on
his
head
as
he
spoke
he
wore
low
shoes
an
open
waistcoat
gave
glimpses
of
a
homely
shirt
of
coarse
linen
was
not
wanting
in
the
round
countenance
with
its
two
slits
of
covetous
eyes
but
there
was
likewise
the
vague
uneasiness
habitual
to
those
who
have
money
to
spend
and
hear
constant
applications
for
it
yet
to
all
appearance
he
was
and
his
business
shrewdness
was
so
well
wadded
round
with
fat
he
had
been
an
assistant
until
he
took
a
wretched
little
shop
on
the
quai
des
augustins
two
years
since
and
issued
thence
on
his
rounds
among
journalists
authors
and
printers
buying
up
free
copies
cheaply
making
in
such
ways
some
ten
or
twenty
francs
daily
now
he
had
money
saved
he
knew
instinctively
where
every
man
was
pressed
he
had
a
keen
eye
for
business
if
an
author
was
in
difficulties
he
would
discount
a
bill
given
by
a
publisher
at
fifteen
or
twenty
per
cent
then
the
next
day
he
would
go
to
the
publisher
haggle
over
the
price
of
some
work
in
demand
and
pay
him
with
his
own
bills
instead
of
cash
barbet
was
something
of
a
scholar
he
had
had
just
enough
education
to
make
him
careful
to
steer
clear
of
modern
poetry
and
modern
romances
he
had
a
liking
for
small
speculations
for
books
of
a
popular
kind
which
might
be
bought
outright
for
a
thousand
francs
and
exploited
at
pleasure
such
as
the
s
history
of
in
twenty
and
for
young
two
or
three
times
already
he
had
allowed
a
good
book
to
slip
through
his
fingers
the
authors
had
come
and
gone
a
score
of
times
while
he
hesitated
and
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
buy
the
manuscript
when
reproached
for
his
pusillanimity
he
was
wont
to
produce
the
account
of
a
notorious
trial
taken
from
the
newspapers
it
cost
him
nothing
and
had
brought
him
in
two
or
three
thousand
francs
barbet
was
the
type
of
bookseller
that
goes
in
fear
and
trembling
lives
on
bread
and
walnuts
rarely
puts
his
name
to
a
bill
filches
little
profits
on
invoices
makes
deductions
and
hawks
his
books
about
himself
heaven
only
knows
where
they
go
but
he
sells
them
somehow
and
gets
paid
for
them
barbet
was
the
terror
of
printers
who
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
him
he
paid
cash
and
took
off
the
discount
he
nibbled
at
their
invoices
whenever
he
thought
they
were
pressed
for
money
and
when
he
had
fleeced
a
man
once
he
never
went
back
to
him
he
feared
to
be
caught
in
his
turn
well
said
lousteau
shall
we
go
on
with
our
business
eh
my
boy
returned
barbet
in
a
familiar
tone
i
have
six
thousand
volumes
of
stock
on
hand
at
my
place
and
paper
is
not
gold
as
the
old
bookseller
said
trade
is
if
you
went
into
his
shop
my
dear
lucien
said
etienne
turning
to
his
friend
you
would
see
an
oak
counter
from
some
bankrupt
wine
merchant
s
sale
and
a
tallow
dip
never
snuffed
for
fear
it
should
burn
too
quickly
making
darkness
visible
by
that
anomalous
light
you
descry
rows
of
empty
shelves
with
some
difficulty
an
urchin
in
a
blue
blouse
mounts
guard
over
the
emptiness
and
blows
his
fingers
and
shuffles
his
feet
and
slaps
his
chest
like
a
cabman
on
the
box
just
look
about
you
there
are
no
more
books
there
than
i
have
here
nobody
could
guess
what
kind
of
shop
he
here
is
a
bill
at
three
months
for
a
hundred
francs
said
barbet
and
he
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
drew
it
out
of
his
pocket
i
will
take
your
old
books
off
your
hands
i
can
t
pay
cash
any
longer
you
see
sales
are
too
slow
i
thought
that
you
would
be
wanting
me
i
had
not
a
penny
and
i
made
a
bill
simply
to
oblige
you
for
i
am
not
fond
of
giving
my
so
you
want
my
thanks
and
esteem
into
the
bargain
do
you
bills
are
not
met
with
sentiment
responded
barbet
but
i
will
accept
your
esteem
all
the
but
i
want
gloves
and
the
perfumers
will
be
base
enough
to
decline
your
paper
said
lousteau
stop
there
is
a
superb
engraving
in
the
top
drawer
of
the
chest
there
worth
eighty
francs
proof
before
letters
and
after
letterpress
for
i
have
written
a
pretty
droll
article
upon
it
there
was
something
to
lay
hold
of
in
refusing
the
presents
of
a
fine
engraving
eh
just
the
thing
to
suit
all
the
doctors
who
are
refusing
the
extravagant
gifts
of
parisian
satraps
you
will
find
two
or
three
dozen
novels
underneath
it
come
now
take
the
lot
and
give
me
forty
exclaimed
the
bookseller
emitting
a
cry
like
the
squall
of
a
frightened
fowl
twenty
at
the
very
most
and
then
i
may
never
see
the
money
again
he
added
where
are
your
twenty
francs
asked
lousteau
my
word
i
don
t
know
that
i
have
them
said
barbet
fumbling
in
his
pockets
here
they
are
you
are
plundering
me
you
have
an
ascendency
over
me
come
let
us
be
off
said
lousteau
and
taking
up
lucien
s
manuscript
he
drew
a
line
upon
it
in
ink
under
the
string
have
you
anything
else
asked
barbet
nothing
you
young
shylock
i
am
going
to
put
you
in
the
way
of
a
bit
of
very
good
business
etienne
continued
in
which
you
shall
lose
a
thousand
crowns
to
teach
you
to
rob
me
in
this
fashion
he
added
for
lucien
s
ear
but
how
about
your
reviews
said
lucien
as
they
rolled
away
to
the
palais
royal
pooh
you
do
not
know
how
reviews
are
knocked
off
as
for
the
in
i
looked
into
the
book
here
and
there
without
cutting
the
pages
and
i
found
eleven
slips
in
grammar
i
shall
say
that
the
writer
may
have
mastered
the
language
on
the
flints
that
they
call
obelisks
out
there
in
egypt
but
he
can
not
write
in
his
own
as
i
will
prove
to
him
in
a
column
and
a
half
i
shall
say
that
instead
of
giving
us
the
natural
history
and
archaeology
he
ought
to
have
interested
himself
in
the
future
of
egypt
in
the
progress
of
civilization
and
the
best
method
of
strengthening
the
bond
between
egypt
and
france
france
has
won
and
lost
egypt
but
she
may
yet
attach
the
country
to
her
interests
by
gaining
a
moral
ascendency
over
it
then
some
patriotic
interlarded
with
diatribes
on
marseilles
the
levant
and
our
but
suppose
that
he
had
taken
that
view
what
would
you
do
oh
well
i
should
say
that
instead
of
boring
us
with
politics
he
should
have
written
about
art
and
described
the
picturesque
aspects
of
the
country
and
the
local
color
then
the
critic
bewails
himself
politics
are
intruded
everywhere
we
are
weary
of
politics
politics
on
all
sides
i
should
regret
those
charming
books
of
travel
that
dwelt
upon
the
difficulties
of
navigation
the
fascination
of
steering
between
two
rocks
the
delights
of
crossing
the
line
and
all
the
things
that
those
who
never
will
travel
ought
to
know
mingle
this
approval
with
scoffing
at
the
travelers
who
hail
the
appearance
of
a
bird
or
a
as
a
great
event
who
dilate
upon
fishing
and
make
transcripts
from
the
log
where
you
ask
is
that
perfectly
unintelligible
scientific
information
fascinating
like
all
that
is
profound
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
the
reader
laughs
that
is
all
that
he
wants
as
for
novels
florine
is
the
greatest
novel
reader
alive
she
gives
me
a
synopsis
and
i
take
her
opinion
and
put
a
review
together
when
a
novelist
bores
her
with
author
s
stuff
as
she
calls
it
i
treat
the
work
respectfully
and
ask
the
publisher
for
another
copy
which
he
sends
forthwith
delighted
to
have
a
favorable
goodness
and
what
of
criticism
the
critic
s
sacred
office
cried
lucien
remembering
the
ideas
instilled
into
him
by
the
brotherhood
my
dear
fellow
said
lousteau
criticism
is
a
kind
of
brush
which
must
not
be
used
upon
flimsy
stuff
or
it
carries
it
all
away
with
it
that
is
enough
of
the
craft
now
listen
do
you
see
that
mark
he
continued
pointing
to
the
manuscript
of
the
i
have
put
ink
on
the
string
and
paper
if
dauriat
reads
your
manuscript
he
certainly
could
not
tie
the
string
and
leave
it
just
as
it
was
before
so
your
book
is
sealed
so
to
speak
this
is
not
useless
to
you
for
the
experiment
that
you
propose
to
make
and
another
thing
please
to
observe
that
you
are
not
arriving
quite
alone
and
without
a
sponsor
in
the
place
like
the
youngsters
who
make
the
round
of
of
publishers
before
they
find
one
that
will
offer
them
a
lucien
s
experience
confirmed
the
truth
of
this
particular
lousteau
paid
the
cabman
giving
him
three
francs
a
piece
of
prodigality
following
upon
such
impecuniosity
astonishing
lucien
more
than
a
little
then
the
two
friends
entered
the
wooden
galleries
where
fashionable
literature
as
it
is
called
used
to
reign
in
state
part
ii
the
wooden
galleries
of
the
palais
royal
used
to
be
one
of
the
most
famous
sights
of
paris
some
description
of
the
squalid
bazar
will
not
be
out
of
place
for
there
are
few
men
of
forty
who
will
not
take
an
interest
in
recollections
of
a
state
of
things
which
will
seem
incredible
to
a
younger
generation
the
great
dreary
spacious
galerie
d
orleans
that
flowerless
hothouse
as
yet
was
not
the
space
upon
which
it
now
stands
was
covered
with
booths
or
to
be
more
precise
with
small
wooden
dens
pervious
to
the
weather
and
dimly
illuminated
on
the
side
of
the
court
and
the
garden
by
borrowed
lights
styled
windows
by
courtesy
but
more
like
the
filthiest
arrangements
for
obscuring
daylight
to
be
found
in
little
wineshops
in
the
suburbs
the
galleries
parallel
passages
about
twelve
feet
in
height
were
formed
by
a
triple
row
of
shops
the
centre
row
giving
back
and
front
upon
the
galleries
was
filled
with
the
fetid
atmosphere
of
the
place
and
derived
a
dubious
daylight
through
the
invariably
dirty
windows
of
the
roof
but
so
thronged
were
these
hives
that
rents
were
excessively
high
and
as
much
as
a
thousand
crowns
was
paid
for
a
space
scarce
six
feet
by
eight
the
outer
rows
gave
respectively
upon
the
garden
and
the
court
and
were
covered
on
that
side
by
a
slight
painted
green
to
protect
the
crazy
plastered
walls
from
continual
friction
with
the
in
a
few
square
feet
of
earth
at
the
back
of
the
shops
strange
freaks
of
vegetable
life
unknown
to
science
grew
amid
the
products
of
various
no
less
flourishing
industries
you
beheld
a
rosebush
capped
with
printed
paper
in
such
a
sort
that
the
flowers
of
rhetoric
were
perfumed
by
the
cankered
blossoms
of
that
garden
handbills
and
ribbon
streamers
of
every
hue
flaunted
gaily
among
the
leaves
natural
flowers
competed
unsuccessfully
for
an
existence
with
odds
and
ends
of
millinery
you
discovered
a
knot
of
ribbon
adorning
a
green
tuft
the
dahlia
admired
afar
proved
on
a
nearer
view
to
be
a
satin
rosette
the
palais
seen
from
the
court
or
from
the
garden
was
a
fantastic
sight
a
grotesque
combination
of
walls
of
plaster
patchwork
which
had
once
been
whitewashed
of
blistered
paint
heterogeneous
placards
and
all
the
most
unaccountable
freaks
of
parisian
squalor
the
green
trellises
were
prodigiously
the
dingier
for
constant
contact
with
a
parisian
public
so
upon
either
side
the
fetid
disreputable
approaches
might
have
been
there
for
the
express
purpose
of
warning
away
fastidious
people
but
fastidious
folk
no
more
recoiled
before
these
horrors
than
the
prince
in
the
fairy
stories
turns
tail
at
sight
of
the
dragon
or
of
the
other
obstacles
put
between
him
and
the
princess
by
the
wicked
fairy
there
was
a
passage
through
the
centre
of
the
galleries
then
as
now
and
as
at
the
present
day
you
entered
them
through
the
two
peristyles
begun
before
the
revolution
and
left
unfinished
for
lack
of
funds
but
in
place
of
the
handsome
modern
arcade
leading
to
the
you
passed
along
a
narrow
disproportionately
lofty
passage
so
that
the
rain
came
through
on
wet
days
all
the
roofs
of
the
hovels
indeed
were
in
very
bad
repair
and
covered
here
and
again
with
a
double
thickness
of
tarpaulin
a
famous
silk
mercer
once
brought
an
action
against
the
orleans
family
for
damages
done
in
the
course
of
a
night
to
his
stock
of
shawls
and
stuffs
and
gained
the
day
and
a
considerable
sum
it
was
in
this
passage
called
the
glass
gallery
to
distinguish
it
from
the
wooden
galleries
that
chevet
laid
the
foundations
of
his
fortunes
here
in
the
palais
you
trod
the
natural
soil
of
paris
augmented
by
importations
brought
in
upon
the
boots
of
foot
passengers
here
at
all
seasons
you
stumbled
among
hills
and
hollows
of
dried
mud
swept
daily
by
the
shopman
s
besom
and
only
after
some
practice
could
you
walk
at
your
ease
the
treacherous
the
incrusted
with
deposits
of
dust
and
rain
the
hovels
covered
with
ragged
placards
the
grimy
unfinished
walls
the
general
air
of
a
compromise
between
a
gypsy
camp
the
booths
of
a
country
fair
and
the
temporary
structures
that
we
in
paris
build
round
about
public
monuments
that
remain
unbuilt
the
grotesque
aspect
of
the
mart
as
a
whole
was
in
keeping
with
the
seething
traffic
of
various
kinds
carried
on
within
it
for
here
in
this
shameless
unblushing
haunt
amid
wild
mirth
and
a
babel
of
talk
an
immense
amount
of
business
was
transacted
between
the
revolution
of
and
the
revolution
of
for
twenty
years
the
bourse
stood
just
opposite
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
palais
public
opinion
was
manufactured
and
reputations
made
and
ruined
here
just
as
political
and
financial
jobs
were
arranged
people
made
appointments
to
meet
in
the
galleries
before
or
after
change
on
showery
days
the
palais
royal
was
often
crowded
with
capitalists
and
men
of
business
the
structure
which
had
grown
up
no
one
knew
how
about
this
point
was
strangely
resonant
laughter
was
multiplied
if
two
men
quarreled
the
whole
place
rang
from
one
end
to
the
other
with
the
dispute
in
the
daytime
milliners
and
booksellers
enjoyed
a
monopoly
of
the
place
towards
nightfall
it
was
filled
with
women
of
the
town
here
dwelt
poetry
politics
and
prose
new
books
and
classics
the
glories
of
ancient
and
modern
literature
side
by
side
with
political
intrigue
and
the
tricks
of
the
bookseller
s
trade
here
all
the
very
latest
and
newest
literature
were
sold
to
a
public
which
resolutely
decline
to
buy
elsewhere
sometimes
several
thousand
copies
of
such
and
such
a
pamphlet
by
courier
would
be
sold
in
a
single
evening
and
people
crowded
thither
to
buy

that
first
shot
fired
by
the
orleanists
at
the
charter
promulgated
by
louis
xviii
when
lucien
made
his
first
appearance
in
the
wooden
galleries
some
few
of
the
shops
boasted
proper
fronts
and
handsome
windows
but
these
in
every
case
looked
upon
the
court
or
the
garden
as
for
the
centre
row
until
the
day
when
the
whole
strange
colony
perished
under
the
hammer
of
fontaine
the
architect
every
shop
was
open
back
and
front
like
a
booth
in
a
country
fair
so
that
from
within
you
could
look
out
upon
either
side
through
gaps
among
the
goods
displayed
or
through
the
glass
doors
as
it
was
obviously
impossible
to
kindle
a
fire
the
tradesmen
were
fain
to
use
charcoal
and
formed
a
sort
of
brigade
for
the
prevention
of
fires
among
themselves
and
indeed
a
little
carelessness
might
have
set
the
whole
quarter
blazing
in
fifteen
minutes
for
the
republic
dried
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
haunted
by
too
inflammable
human
material
was
bedizened
with
muslin
and
paper
and
gauze
and
ventilated
at
times
by
a
thorough
draught
the
milliners
windows
were
full
of
impossible
hats
and
bonnets
displayed
apparently
for
advertisement
rather
than
for
sale
each
on
a
separate
iron
spit
with
a
knob
at
the
top
the
galleries
were
decked
out
in
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
on
what
heads
would
those
dusty
bonnets
end
their
careers
for
a
score
of
years
the
problem
had
puzzled
frequenters
of
the
palais
saleswomen
usually
but
vivacious
waylaid
the
feminine
foot
passenger
with
cunning
importunities
after
the
fashion
of
and
using
much
the
same
language
a
who
made
free
use
of
her
eyes
and
tongue
sat
outside
on
a
stool
and
harangued
the
public
with

pretty
bonnet
madame

let
me
sell
you
something
varying
a
rich
and
picturesque
vocabulary
with
inflections
of
the
voice
with
glances
and
remarks
upon
the
booksellers
and
milliners
lived
on
terms
of
mutual
understanding
but
it
was
in
the
passage
known
by
the
pompous
title
of
the
glass
gallery
that
the
oddest
trades
were
carried
on
here
were
ventriloquists
and
charlatans
of
every
sort
and
sights
of
every
description
from
the
kind
where
there
is
nothing
to
see
to
panoramas
of
the
globe
one
man
who
has
since
made
seven
or
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
by
traveling
from
fair
to
fair
began
here
by
hanging
out
a
signboard
a
revolving
sun
in
a
blackboard
and
the
inscription
in
red
letters
here
man
may
see
what
god
can
never
see
admittance
two
the
showman
at
the
door
never
admitted
one
person
alone
nor
more
than
two
at
a
time
once
inside
you
confronted
a
great
and
a
voice
which
might
have
terrified
hoffmann
of
berlin
suddenly
spoke
as
if
some
spring
had
been
touched
you
see
here
gentlemen
something
that
god
can
never
see
through
all
eternity
that
is
to
say
your
like
god
has
not
his
and
out
you
went
too
shamefaced
to
confess
to
your
stupidity
voices
issued
from
every
narrow
doorway
crying
up
the
merits
of
cosmoramas
views
of
constantinople
marionettes
automatic
and
performing
dogs
who
would
pick
you
out
the
prettiest
woman
in
the
company
the
ventriloquist
flourished
here
in
the
cafe
borel
before
he
went
to
fight
and
fall
at
montmartre
with
the
young
lads
from
the
ecole
polytechnique
here
too
there
were
fruit
and
flower
shops
and
a
famous
tailor
whose
uniforms
shone
like
the
sun
when
the
shops
were
lighted
at
night
of
a
morning
the
galleries
were
empty
dark
and
deserted
the
shopkeepers
chatted
among
themselves
towards
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
palais
began
to
fill
at
three
men
came
in
from
the
bourse
and
paris
generally
speaking
crowded
the
place
impecunious
youth
hungering
after
literature
took
the
opportunity
of
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
books
exposed
for
sale
on
the
stalls
outside
the
booksellers
shops
the
men
in
charge
charitably
allowed
a
poor
student
to
pursue
his
course
of
free
studies
and
in
this
way
a
duodecimo
volume
of
some
two
hundred
pages
such
as
or
or
or
might
be
devoured
in
a
couple
of
afternoons
there
was
something
very
french
in
this
alms
given
to
the
young
hungry
starved
intellect
circulating
libraries
were
not
as
yet
if
you
wished
to
read
a
book
you
were
obliged
to
buy
it
for
which
reason
novels
of
the
early
part
of
the
century
were
sold
in
numbers
which
now
seem
fabulous
to
us
but
the
poetry
of
this
terrible
mart
appeared
in
all
its
splendor
at
the
close
of
the
day
women
of
the
town
flocking
in
and
out
from
the
neighboring
streets
were
allowed
to
make
a
promenade
of
the
wooden
galleries
thither
came
prostitutes
from
every
quarter
of
paris
to
do
the
the
stone
galleries
belonged
to
privileged
houses
which
paid
for
the
right
of
exposing
women
dressed
like
princesses
under
such
and
such
an
arch
or
in
the
corresponding
space
of
garden
but
the
wooden
galleries
were
the
common
ground
of
women
of
the
streets
this
was
palais
a
word
which
used
to
signify
the
temple
of
prostitution
a
woman
might
come
and
go
taking
away
her
prey
whithersoever
seemed
good
to
her
so
great
was
the
crowd
attracted
thither
at
night
by
the
women
that
it
was
impossible
to
move
except
at
a
slow
pace
as
in
a
procession
or
at
a
masked
ball
nobody
objected
to
the
slowness
it
facilitated
examination
the
women
dressed
in
a
way
that
is
never
seen
nowadays
the
bodices
cut
extremely
low
both
back
and
front
the
fantastical
designed
to
attract
notice
here
a
cap
from
the
pays
de
caux
and
there
a
spanish
mantilla
the
hair
crimped
and
curled
like
a
poodle

smoothed
down
in
bandeaux
over
the
forehead
the
white
stockings
and
limbs
revealed
it
would
not
be
easy
to
say
how
but
always
at
the
right
moment
all
this
poetry
of
vice
has
fled
the
license
of
question
and
reply
the
public
cynicism
in
keeping
with
the
haunt
is
now
unknown
even
at
masquerades
or
the
famous
public
balls
it
was
an
appalling
gay
scene
the
dazzling
white
flesh
of
the
women
s
necks
and
shoulders
stood
out
in
magnificent
contrast
against
the
men
s
almost
invariably
sombre
costumes
the
murmur
of
voices
the
hum
of
the
crowd
could
be
heard
even
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
as
a
sort
of
droning
bass
interspersed
with
of
shrill
laughter
or
clamor
of
some
rare
dispute
you
saw
gentlemen
and
celebrities
cheek
by
jowl
with
there
was
something
indescribably
piquant
about
the
anomalous
assemblage
the
most
insensible
of
men
felt
its
charm
so
much
so
that
until
the
very
last
moment
paris
came
hither
to
walk
up
and
down
on
the
wooden
planks
laid
over
the
cellars
where
men
were
at
work
on
the
new
buildings
and
when
the
squalid
wooden
erections
were
finally
taken
down
great
and
unanimous
regret
was
felt
ladvocat
the
bookseller
had
opened
a
shop
but
a
few
days
since
in
the
angle
formed
by
the
central
passage
which
crossed
the
galleries
and
immediately
opposite
another
bookseller
now
forgotten
dauriat
a
bold
and
youthful
pioneer
who
opened
up
the
paths
in
which
his
rival
was
to
shine
dauriat
s
shop
stood
in
the
row
which
gave
upon
the
garden
ladvocat
s
on
the
opposite
side
looked
out
upon
the
court
dauriat
s
establishment
was
divided
into
two
parts
his
shop
was
simply
a
great
trade
warehouse
and
the
second
room
was
his
private
office
lucien
on
this
first
visit
to
the
wooden
galleries
was
bewildered
by
a
sight
which
no
novice
can
resist
he
soon
lost
the
guide
who
befriended
him
if
you
were
as
as
yonder
young
fellow
i
would
give
you
your
money
s
worth
a
woman
said
pointing
out
lucien
to
an
old
man
lucien
slunk
through
the
crowd
like
a
blind
man
s
dog
following
the
stream
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
and
excitement
difficult
to
describe
importuned
by
glances
and
contours
dazzled
by
the
audacious
display
of
bared
throat
and
bosom
he
gripped
his
roll
of
manuscript
tightly
lest
somebody
should
steal
it
innocent
that
he
was
well
what
is
it
sir
he
exclaimed
thinking
when
some
one
caught
him
by
the
arm
that
his
poetry
had
proved
too
great
a
temptation
to
some
author
s
honesty
and
turning
he
recognized
lousteau
i
felt
sure
that
you
would
find
your
way
here
at
last
said
his
friend
the
poet
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
a
shop
crowded
with
persons
waiting
for
an
audience
with
the
sultan
of
the
publishing
trade
printers
and
designers
were
catechizing
dauriat
s
assistants
as
to
present
or
future
business
lousteau
drew
lucien
into
the
shop
there
that
is
finot
who
edits
my
paper
he
said
he
is
talking
with
felicien
vernou
who
has
abilities
but
the
little
wretch
is
as
dangerous
as
a
hidden
well
old
boy
there
is
a
first
night
for
you
said
finot
coming
up
with
vernou
i
have
disposed
of
the
sold
it
to
braulard
well
and
if
i
did
what
then
you
will
get
a
seat
what
do
you
want
with
dauriat
oh
it
is
agreed
that
we
are
to
push
paul
de
kock
dauriat
has
taken
two
hundred
copies
and
victor
ducange
is
refusing
to
give
him
his
next
dauriat
wants
to
set
up
another
man
in
the
same
line
he
says
you
must
rate
paul
de
kock
above
but
i
have
a
piece
on
with
ducange
at
the
gaite
said
lousteau
very
well
tell
him
that
i
wrote
the
article
it
can
be
supposed
that
i
wrote
a
slashing
review
and
you
toned
it
down
and
he
will
owe
you
couldn
t
you
get
dauriat
s
cashier
to
discount
this
bit
of
a
bill
for
a
hundred
francs
asked
etienne
lousteau
we
are
celebrating
florine
s
with
a
supper
you
ah
yes
you
are
treating
us
all
said
finot
with
an
apparent
effort
of
memory
here
gabusson
he
added
handing
barbet
s
bill
to
the
cashier
let
me
have
ninety
francs
for
this
fill
in
your
name
old
lousteau
signed
his
name
while
the
cashier
counted
out
the
money
and
lucien
all
eyes
and
ears
lost
not
a
syllable
of
the
conversation
that
is
not
all
my
friend
etienne
continued
i
don
t
thank
you
we
have
sworn
an
eternal
friendship
i
have
taken
it
upon
myself
to
introduce
this
gentleman
to
dauriat
and
you
must
incline
his
ear
to
listen
to
what
is
on
foot
asked
finot
a
volume
of
poetry
said
lucien
oh
said
finot
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
your
acquaintance
can
not
have
had
much
to
do
with
publishers
or
he
would
have
hidden
his
manuscript
in
the
loneliest
spot
in
his
dwelling
remarked
vernou
looking
at
lucien
as
he
spoke
just
at
that
moment
a
young
man
came
into
the
shop
gave
a
hand
to
finot
and
lousteau
and
nodded
slightly
to
vernou
the
newcomer
was
emile
blondet
who
had
made
his
first
appearance
in
the
des
with
articles
revealing
capacities
of
the
very
highest
order
come
and
have
supper
with
us
at
midnight
at
florine
s
said
lousteau
very
good
said
the
newcomer
but
who
is
going
to
be
there
oh
florine
and
matifat
the
druggist
said
lousteau
and
du
bruel
the
author
who
gave
florine
the
part
in
which
she
is
to
make
her
first
appearance
a
little
old
fogy
named
cardot
and
his
camusot
and
finot
and
does
your
druggist
do
things
properly
he
will
not
give
us
doctored
wine
said
lucien
you
are
very
witty
monsieur
blondet
returned
gravely
is
he
coming
lousteau
then
we
shall
have
some
lucien
had
flushed
red
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
blondet
tapped
on
the
window
above
dauriat
s
desk
is
your
business
likely
to
keep
you
long
dauriat
i
am
at
your
service
my
that
s
right
said
lousteau
addressing
his
protege
that
young
fellow
is
hardly
any
older
than
you
are
and
he
is
on
the
he
is
one
of
the
princes
of
criticism
they
are
afraid
of
him
dauriat
will
fawn
upon
him
and
then
we
can
put
in
a
word
about
our
business
with
the
pasha
of
vignettes
and
type
otherwise
we
might
have
waited
till
eleven
o
clock
and
our
turn
would
not
have
come
the
crowd
of
people
waiting
to
speak
with
dauriat
is
growing
bigger
every
lucien
and
lousteau
followed
blondet
finot
and
vernou
and
stood
in
a
knot
at
the
back
of
the
shop
what
is
he
doing
asked
blondet
of
the
who
rose
to
bid
him
he
is
buying
a
weekly
newspaper
he
wants
to
put
new
life
into
it
and
set
up
a
rival
to
the
and
the
eymery
has
rather
too
much
of
his
own
way
in
the
and
the
is
too
blindly
is
he
going
to
pay
well
only
too
much
as
usual
said
the
cashier
just
as
he
spoke
another
young
man
entered
this
was
the
writer
of
a
magnificent
novel
which
had
sold
very
rapidly
and
met
with
the
greatest
possible
success
dauriat
was
bringing
out
a
second
edition
the
appearance
of
this
odd
and
extraordinary
looking
being
so
unmistakably
an
artist
made
a
deep
impression
on
lucien
s
mind
that
is
nathan
lousteau
said
in
his
ear
nathan
then
in
the
prime
of
his
youth
came
up
to
the
group
of
journalists
hat
in
hand
and
in
spite
of
his
look
of
fierce
pride
he
was
almost
humble
to
blondet
whom
as
yet
he
only
knew
by
sight
blondet
did
not
remove
his
hat
neither
did
finot
monsieur
i
am
delighted
to
avail
myself
of
an
opportunity
yielded
by
chance
he
is
so
nervous
that
he
is
committing
a
pleonasm
said
felicien
in
an
aside
to
lousteau
to
give
expression
to
my
gratitude
for
the
splendid
review
which
you
were
so
good
as
to
give
me
in
the
des
half
the
success
of
my
book
is
owing
to
no
my
dear
fellow
no
said
blondet
with
an
air
of
patronage
scarcely
masked
by
you
have
talent
the
deuce
you
have
and
i
m
delighted
to
make
your
now
that
your
review
has
appeared
i
shall
not
seem
to
be
courting
power
we
can
feel
at
ease
will
you
do
me
the
honor
and
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
me
finot
is
lousteau
old
man
you
will
not
refuse
me
will
you
added
nathan
shaking
etienne
by
the
ah
you
are
on
the
way
to
a
great
future
monsieur
he
added
turning
again
to
blondet
you
will
carry
on
the
line
of
dussaults
fievees
and
geoffrois
hoffmann
was
talking
about
you
to
a
friend
of
mine
claude
vignon
his
pupil
he
said
that
he
could
die
in
peace
the
des
would
live
forever
they
ought
to
pay
you
tremendously
a
hundred
francs
a
column
said
blondet
poor
pay
when
one
is
obliged
to
read
the
books
and
read
a
hundred
before
you
find
one
worth
interesting
yourself
in
like
yours
your
work
gave
me
pleasure
upon
my
and
brought
him
in
fifteen
hundred
francs
said
lousteau
for
lucien
s
benefit
but
you
write
political
articles
don
t
you
asked
nathan
yes
now
and
lucien
felt
like
an
embryo
among
these
men
he
had
admired
nathan
s
book
he
had
reverenced
the
author
as
an
immortal
nathan
s
abject
attitude
before
this
critic
whose
name
and
importance
were
both
unknown
to
him
stupefied
lucien
how
if
i
should
come
to
behave
as
he
does
he
thought
is
a
man
obliged
to
part
with
his
pray
put
on
your
hat
again
nathan
you
have
written
a
great
book
and
the
critic
has
only
written
a
review
of
these
thoughts
set
the
blood
tingling
in
his
veins
scarce
a
minute
passed
but
some
young
author
and
shy
came
in
asked
to
speak
with
dauriat
looked
round
the
crowded
shop
despairingly
and
went
out
saying
i
will
come
back
two
or
three
politicians
were
chatting
over
the
convocation
of
the
chambers
and
public
business
with
a
group
of
public
men
the
weekly
newspaper
for
which
dauriat
was
in
treaty
was
licensed
to
treat
of
matters
political
and
the
number
of
newspapers
suffered
to
exist
was
growing
smaller
and
smaller
till
a
paper
was
a
piece
of
property
as
much
in
demand
as
a
theatre
one
of
the
largest
shareholders
in
the
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
knot
of
political
celebrities
lousteau
performed
the
part
of
cicerone
to
admiration
with
every
sentence
he
uttered
dauriat
rose
higher
in
lucien
s
opinion
politics
and
literature
seemed
to
converge
in
dauriat
s
shop
he
had
seen
a
great
poet
prostituting
his
muse
to
journalism
humiliating
art
as
woman
was
humiliated
and
prostituted
in
those
shameless
galleries
without
and
the
provincial
took
a
terrible
lesson
to
heart
money
that
was
the
key
to
every
enigma
lucien
realized
the
fact
that
he
was
unknown
and
alone
and
that
the
fragile
clue
of
an
uncertain
friendship
was
his
sole
guide
to
success
and
fortune
he
blamed
the
kind
and
loyal
little
circle
for
painting
the
world
for
him
in
false
colors
for
preventing
him
from
plunging
into
the
arena
pen
in
hand
i
should
be
a
blondet
at
this
moment
he
exclaimed
within
himself
only
a
little
while
ago
they
had
sat
looking
out
over
paris
from
the
gardens
of
the
luxembourg
and
lousteau
had
uttered
the
cry
of
a
wounded
eagle
then
lousteau
had
been
a
great
man
in
lucien
s
eyes
and
now
he
had
shrunk
to
scarce
visible
proportions
the
really
important
man
for
him
at
this
moment
was
the
fashionable
bookseller
by
whom
all
these
men
lived
and
the
poet
manuscript
in
hand
felt
a
nervous
tremor
that
was
almost
like
fear
he
noticed
a
group
of
busts
mounted
on
wooden
pedestals
painted
to
resemble
marble
byron
stood
there
and
goethe
and
de
canalis
dauriat
was
hoping
to
publish
a
volume
by
the
poet
who
might
see
on
his
entrance
into
the
shop
the
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
by
the
trade
unconsciously
lucien
s
own
began
to
shrink
and
his
courage
ebbed
he
began
to
see
how
large
a
part
this
dauriat
would
play
in
his
destinies
and
waited
impatiently
for
him
to
appear
well
children
said
a
voice
and
a
short
stout
man
appeared
with
a
puffy
face
that
suggested
a
roman
s
visage
mellowed
by
an
air
of
which
deceived
superficial
observers
well
children
here
am
i
the
proprietor
of
the
only
weekly
paper
in
the
market
a
paper
with
two
thousand
subscribers
old
joker
the
registered
number
is
seven
hundred
and
that
is
over
the
mark
said
blondet
twelve
thousand
on
my
sacred
word
of
honor
i
said
two
thousand
for
the
benefit
of
the
printers
and
yonder
he
added
lowering
his
voice
then
raising
it
again
i
thought
you
had
more
tact
my
boy
he
added
are
you
going
to
take
any
partners
inquired
finot
that
depends
said
dauriat
will
you
take
a
third
at
forty
thousand
francs
it
s
a
bargain
if
you
will
take
emile
blondet
here
on
the
staff
and
claude
vignon
scribe
theodore
leclercq
felicien
vernou
jay
jouy
lousteau
and
and
why
not
lucien
de
rubempre
the
provincial
poet
put
in
boldly
and
nathan
concluded
finot
why
not
the
people
out
there
in
the
street
asked
dauriat
scowling
at
the
author
of
the
to
whom
have
i
the
honor
of
speaking
he
added
with
an
insolent
glance
one
moment
dauriat
said
lousteau
i
have
brought
this
gentleman
to
you
listen
to
me
while
finot
is
thinking
over
your
lucien
watched
this
dauriat
who
addressed
finot
with
the
familiar
tu
which
even
finot
did
not
permit
himself
to
use
in
reply
who
called
the
redoubtable
blondet
my
boy
and
extended
a
hand
royally
to
nathan
with
a
friendly
nod
the
provincial
poet
felt
his
shirt
wet
with
perspiration
when
the
formidable
sultan
looked
indifferent
and
ill
pleased
another
piece
of
business
my
boy
exclaimed
dauriat
why
i
have
eleven
hundred
manuscripts
on
hand
as
you
know
yes
gentlemen
i
have
eleven
hundred
manuscripts
submitted
to
me
at
this
moment
ask
gabusson
i
shall
soon
be
obliged
to
start
a
department
to
keep
account
of
the
stock
of
manuscripts
and
a
special
office
for
reading
them
and
a
committee
to
vote
on
their
merits
with
numbered
counters
for
those
who
attend
and
a
permanent
secretary
to
draw
up
the
minutes
for
me
it
will
be
a
kind
of
local
branch
of
the
academie
and
the
academicians
will
be
better
paid
in
the
wooden
galleries
than
at
the
tis
an
idea
said
blondet
a
bad
idea
returned
dauriat
it
is
not
my
business
to
take
stock
of
the
lucubrations
of
those
among
you
who
take
to
literature
because
they
can
not
be
capitalists
and
there
is
no
opening
for
them
as
bootmakers
nor
corporals
nor
domestic
servants
nor
officials
nor
bailiffs
nobody
comes
here
until
he
has
made
a
name
for
himself
make
a
name
for
yourself
and
you
will
find
gold
in
torrents
i
have
made
three
great
men
in
the
last
two
years
and
lo
and
behold
three
examples
of
ingratitude
here
is
nathan
talking
of
six
thousand
francs
for
the
second
edition
of
his
book
which
cost
me
three
thousand
francs
in
reviews
and
has
not
brought
in
a
thousand
yet
i
paid
a
thousand
francs
for
blondet
s
two
articles
besides
a
dinner
which
cost
me
five
hundred
but
if
all
booksellers
talked
as
you
do
sir
how
could
a
man
publish
his
first
book
at
all
asked
lucien
blondet
had
gone
down
tremendously
in
his
opinion
since
he
had
heard
the
amount
given
by
dauriat
for
the
articles
in
the
that
is
not
my
affair
said
dauriat
looking
daggers
at
this
handsome
young
fellow
who
was
smiling
pleasantly
at
him
i
do
not
publish
books
for
amusement
nor
risk
two
thousand
francs
for
the
sake
of
seeing
my
money
back
again
i
speculate
in
literature
and
publish
forty
volumes
of
ten
thousand
copies
each
just
as
panckouke
does
and
the
baudoins
with
my
influence
and
the
articles
which
i
secure
i
can
push
a
business
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
instead
of
a
single
volume
involving
a
couple
of
thousand
francs
it
is
just
as
much
trouble
to
bring
out
a
new
name
and
to
induce
the
public
to
take
up
an
author
and
his
book
as
to
make
a
success
with
the
et
or
sur
la
books
that
bring
in
a
fortune
i
am
not
here
as
a
to
future
fame
but
to
make
money
and
to
find
it
for
men
with
distinguished
names
the
manuscripts
for
which
i
give
a
hundred
thousand
francs
pay
me
better
than
work
by
an
unknown
author
who
asks
six
hundred
if
i
am
not
exactly
a
maecenas
i
deserve
the
gratitude
of
literature
i
have
doubled
the
prices
of
manuscripts
i
am
giving
you
this
explanation
because
you
are
a
friend
of
lousteau
s
my
boy
added
dauriat
clapping
lucien
on
the
shoulder
with
odious
familiarity
if
i
were
to
talk
to
all
the
authors
who
have
a
mind
that
i
should
be
their
publisher
i
should
have
to
shut
up
shop
i
should
pass
my
time
very
agreeably
no
doubt
but
the
conversations
would
cost
too
much
i
am
not
rich
enough
yet
to
listen
to
all
the
monologues
of
nobody
does
except
in
classical
tragedies
on
the
the
terrible
dauriat
s
gorgeous
raiment
seemed
in
the
provincial
poet
s
eyes
to
add
force
to
the
man
s
remorseless
logic
what
is
it
about
he
continued
addressing
lucien
s
protector
it
is
a
volume
of
magnificent
at
that
word
dauriat
turned
to
gabusson
with
a
gesture
worthy
of
talma
gabusson
my
friend
he
said
from
this
day
forward
when
anybody
begins
to
talk
of
works
in
manuscript
here
do
you
hear
that
all
of
you
he
broke
in
upon
himself
and
three
assistants
at
once
emerged
from
among
the
piles
of
books
at
the
sound
of
their
employer
s
wrathful
voice
if
anybody
comes
here
with
manuscripts
he
continued
looking
at
the
of
a
hand
ask
him
whether
it
is
poetry
or
prose
and
if
he
says
poetry
show
him
the
door
at
once
verses
mean
reverses
in
the
bravo
well
put
dauriat
cried
the
chorus
of
journalists
it
is
true
cried
the
bookseller
striding
about
his
shop
with
lucien
s
manuscript
in
his
hand
you
have
no
idea
gentlemen
of
the
amount
of
harm
that
byron
lamartine
victor
hugo
casimir
delavigne
canalis
and
beranger
have
done
by
their
success
the
fame
of
them
has
brought
down
an
invasion
of
barbarians
upon
us
i
know
there
are
a
thousand
volumes
of
manuscript
poetry
going
the
round
of
the
publishers
at
this
moment
things
that
nobody
can
make
head
nor
tail
of
stories
in
verse
that
begin
in
the
middle
like
and
they
set
up
to
be
original
forsooth
and
indulge
in
stanzas
that
nobody
can
understand
and
descriptive
poetry
after
the
pattern
of
the
younger
men
who
discovered
delille
and
imagine
that
they
are
doing
something
new
poets
have
been
swarming
like
cockchafers
for
two
years
past
i
have
lost
twenty
thousand
francs
through
poetry
in
the
last
twelvemonth
you
ask
gabusson
there
may
be
immortal
poets
somewhere
in
the
world
i
know
of
some
that
are
blooming
and
rosy
and
have
no
beards
on
their
chins
as
yet
he
continued
looking
at
lucien
but
in
the
trade
young
man
there
are
only
four
poets
beranger
casimir
delavigne
lamartine
and
victor
hugo
as
for
canalis
he
is
a
poet
made
by
sheer
force
of
writing
him
lucien
felt
that
he
lacked
the
courage
to
hold
up
his
head
and
show
his
spirit
before
all
these
influential
persons
who
were
laughing
with
all
their
might
he
knew
very
well
that
he
should
look
hopelessly
ridiculous
and
yet
he
felt
consumed
by
a
fierce
desire
to
catch
the
bookseller
by
the
throat
to
ruffle
the
insolent
composure
of
his
cravat
to
break
the
gold
chain
that
glittered
on
the
man
s
chest
trample
his
watch
under
his
feet
and
tear
him
in
pieces
mortified
vanity
opened
the
door
to
thoughts
of
vengeance
and
inwardly
he
swore
eternal
enmity
to
that
bookseller
but
he
smiled
amiably
poetry
is
like
the
sun
said
blondet
giving
life
alike
to
primeval
forests
and
to
ants
and
gnats
and
mosquitoes
there
is
no
virtue
but
has
a
vice
to
match
and
literature
breeds
the
and
the
journalist
said
lousteau
dauriat
burst
out
laughing
what
is
this
after
all
he
asked
holding
up
the
manuscript
a
volume
of
sonnets
that
will
put
petrarch
to
the
blush
said
lousteau
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
say
answered
lousteau
seeing
the
knowing
smile
that
went
round
the
group
lucien
could
not
take
offence
but
he
chafed
inwardly
very
well
i
will
read
them
said
dauriat
with
a
regal
gesture
that
marked
the
full
extent
of
the
concession
if
these
sonnets
of
yours
are
up
to
the
level
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
will
make
a
great
poet
of
you
my
if
he
has
brains
to
equal
his
good
looks
you
will
run
no
great
risks
remarked
one
of
the
greatest
public
speakers
of
the
day
a
deputy
who
was
chatting
with
the
editor
of
the
and
a
writer
for
the
fame
means
twelve
thousand
francs
in
reviews
and
a
thousand
more
for
dinners
general
said
dauriat
if
benjamin
de
constant
means
to
write
a
paper
on
this
young
poet
it
will
not
be
long
before
i
make
a
bargain
with
at
the
title
of
general
and
the
distinguished
name
of
benjamin
constant
the
bookseller
s
shop
took
the
proportions
of
olympus
for
the
provincial
great
man
lousteau
i
want
a
word
with
you
said
finot
but
i
shall
see
you
again
later
at
the
dauriat
i
will
take
your
offer
but
on
conditions
let
us
step
into
your
come
in
my
boy
answered
dauriat
allowing
finot
to
pass
before
him
then
intimating
to
some
ten
persons
still
waiting
for
him
that
he
was
engaged
he
likewise
was
about
to
disappear
when
lucien
impatiently
stopped
him
you
are
keeping
my
manuscript
when
shall
i
have
an
answer
oh
come
back
in
three
or
four
days
my
little
poet
and
we
will
lousteau
hurried
lucien
away
he
had
not
time
to
take
leave
of
vernou
and
blondet
and
raoul
nathan
nor
to
salute
general
foy
nor
benjamin
constant
whose
book
on
the
hundred
days
was
just
about
to
appear
lucien
scarcely
caught
a
glimpse
of
fair
hair
a
refined
face
keen
eyes
and
the
mouth
belonging
to
the
man
who
had
played
the
part
of
a
potemkin
to
mme
de
stael
for
twenty
years
and
now
was
at
war
with
the
bourbons
as
he
had
been
at
war
with
napoleon
he
was
destined
to
win
his
cause
and
to
die
stricken
to
earth
by
his
victory
what
a
shop
exclaimed
lucien
as
he
took
his
place
in
the
cab
beside
lousteau
to
the
look
sharp
and
you
shall
have
thirty
sous
etienne
lousteau
called
to
the
dauriat
is
a
rascal
who
sells
books
to
the
amount
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
hundred
thousand
francs
every
year
he
is
a
kind
of
minister
of
literature
lousteau
continued
his
had
been
pleasantly
tickled
and
he
was
showing
off
before
lucien
dauriat
is
just
as
grasping
as
barbet
but
it
is
on
a
wholesale
scale
dauriat
can
be
civil
and
he
is
generous
but
he
has
a
great
opinion
of
himself
as
for
his
wit
it
consists
in
a
faculty
for
picking
up
all
that
he
hears
and
his
shop
is
a
capital
place
to
frequent
you
meet
all
the
best
men
at
dauriat
s
a
young
fellow
learns
more
there
in
an
hour
than
by
poring
over
books
for
of
years
people
talk
about
articles
and
concoct
subjects
you
make
the
acquaintance
of
great
or
influential
people
who
may
be
useful
to
you
you
must
know
people
if
you
mean
to
get
on
it
is
all
luck
you
see
and
as
for
sitting
by
yourself
in
a
corner
alone
with
your
intellect
it
is
the
most
dangerous
thing
of
but
what
insolence
said
lucien
pshaw
we
all
of
us
laugh
at
dauriat
said
etienne
if
you
are
in
need
of
him
he
tramples
upon
you
if
he
has
need
of
the
des
emile
blondet
sets
him
spinning
like
a
top
oh
if
you
take
to
literature
you
will
see
a
good
many
queer
things
well
what
was
i
telling
you
eh
yes
you
were
right
said
lucien
my
experience
in
that
shop
was
even
more
painful
than
i
expected
after
your
why
do
you
choose
to
suffer
you
find
your
subject
you
wear
out
your
wits
over
it
with
toiling
at
night
you
throw
your
very
life
into
it
and
after
all
your
journeyings
in
the
fields
of
thought
the
monument
reared
with
your
is
simply
a
good
or
a
bad
speculation
for
a
publisher
your
work
will
sell
or
it
will
not
sell
and
therein
for
them
lies
the
whole
question
a
book
means
so
much
capital
to
risk
and
the
better
the
book
the
less
likely
it
is
to
sell
a
man
of
talent
rises
above
the
level
of
ordinary
heads
his
success
varies
in
direct
ratio
with
the
time
required
for
his
work
to
be
appreciated
and
no
publisher
wants
to
wait
s
book
must
be
sold
by
acting
on
this
system
publishers
and
booksellers
do
not
care
to
take
real
literature
books
that
call
for
the
high
praise
that
comes
d
arthez
was
right
exclaimed
lucien
do
you
know
d
arthez
asked
lousteau
i
know
of
no
more
dangerous
company
than
solitary
spirits
like
that
fellow
yonder
who
fancy
that
they
can
draw
the
world
after
them
all
of
us
begin
by
thinking
that
we
are
capable
of
great
things
and
when
once
a
youthful
imagination
is
heated
by
this
superstition
the
candidate
for
posthumous
honors
makes
no
attempt
to
move
the
world
while
such
moving
of
the
world
is
both
possible
and
profitable
he
lets
the
time
go
by

if
the
mountain
does
not
come
to

i
am
for
going
to
the
the
so
trenchantly
put
in
this
sally
left
lucien
halting
between
the
resignation
preached
by
the
brotherhood
and
lousteau
s
militant
doctrine
he
said
not
a
word
till
they
reached
the
boulevard
du
temple
the
no
longer
exists
a
stands
on
the
site
of
the
once
charming
theatre
in
the
boulevard
du
temple
where
two
successive
managements
collapsed
without
making
a
single
hit
and
yet
vignol
who
has
since
fallen
heir
to
some
of
potier
s
popularity
made
his
there
and
florine
five
years
later
a
celebrated
actress
made
her
first
appearance
in
the
theatre
opposite
the
rue
charlot
like
men
have
their
vicissitudes
the
suffered
from
competition
the
machinations
of
its
rivals
the
ambigu
the
gaite
the
porte
and
the
vaudeville
together
with
a
plethora
of
restrictions
and
a
scarcity
of
good
plays
combined
to
bring
about
the
downfall
of
the
house
no
dramatic
author
cared
to
quarrel
with
a
prosperous
theatre
for
the
sake
of
the
whose
existence
was
to
say
the
least
problematical
the
management
at
this
moment
however
was
counting
on
the
success
of
a
new
melodramatic
comedy
by
du
bruel
a
young
author
who
after
working
in
collaboration
with
divers
celebrities
had
now
produced
a
piece
professedly
entirely
his
own
it
had
been
specially
composed
for
the
leading
lady
a
young
actress
who
began
her
stage
career
as
a
supernumerary
at
the
gaite
and
had
been
promoted
to
small
parts
for
the
last
twelvemonth
but
though
mlle
florine
s
acting
had
attracted
some
attention
she
obtained
no
engagement
and
the
panorama
accordingly
had
carried
her
off
coralie
another
actress
was
to
make
her
at
the
same
time
lucien
was
amazed
at
the
power
wielded
by
the
press
this
gentleman
is
with
me
said
etienne
lousteau
and
the
clerks
bowed
before
him
as
one
man
you
will
find
it
no
easy
matter
to
get
seats
said
the
there
is
nothing
left
now
but
the
stage
a
certain
amount
of
time
was
wasted
in
controversies
with
the
in
the
lobbies
when
etienne
said
let
us
go
behind
the
scenes
we
will
speak
to
the
manager
he
will
take
us
into
the
and
besides
i
will
introduce
you
to
florine
the
heroine
of
the
at
a
sign
from
etienne
lousteau
the
doorkeeper
of
the
orchestra
took
out
a
little
key
and
unlocked
a
door
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
lucien
following
his
friend
went
suddenly
out
of
the
lighted
corridor
into
the
black
darkness
of
the
passage
between
the
house
and
the
wings
a
short
flight
of
damp
steps
surmounted
one
of
the
strangest
of
all
spectacles
opened
out
before
the
provincial
poet
s
eyes
the
height
of
the
roof
the
slenderness
of
the
props
the
ladders
hung
with
argand
lamps
the
atrocious
ugliness
of
scenery
beheld
at
close
quarters
the
thick
paint
on
the
actors
faces
and
their
outlandish
costumes
made
of
such
coarse
materials
the
stage
carpenters
in
greasy
jackets
the
firemen
the
stage
manager
strutting
about
with
his
hat
on
his
head
the
supernumeraries
sitting
among
the
hanging
the
ropes
and
pulleys
the
heterogeneous
collection
of
absurdities
shabby
dirty
hideous
and
gaudy
was
something
so
altogether
different
from
the
stage
seen
over
the
footlights
that
lucien
s
astonishment
knew
no
bounds
the
curtain
was
just
about
to
fall
on
a
good
melodrama
entitled
a
play
adapted
from
a
tragedy
by
maturin
which
charles
nodier
together
with
byron
and
sir
walter
scott
held
in
the
highest
esteem
though
the
play
was
a
failure
on
the
stage
in
paris
keep
a
tight
hold
of
my
arm
unless
you
have
a
mind
to
fall
through
a
or
bring
down
a
forest
on
your
head
you
will
pull
down
a
palace
or
carry
off
a
cottage
if
you
are
not
careful
said
is
florine
in
her
my
pet
he
added
addressing
an
actress
who
stood
waiting
for
her
cue
yes
love
thank
you
for
the
things
you
said
about
me
you
are
so
much
nicer
since
florine
has
come
come
don
t
spoil
your
entry
little
one
quick
with
you
look
sharp
and
say
stop
wretched
man
nicely
for
there
are
two
thousand
francs
of
lucien
was
struck
with
amazement
when
the
girl
s
whole
face
suddenly
changed
and
she
shrieked
stop
wretched
man
a
cry
that
froze
the
blood
in
your
veins
she
was
no
longer
the
same
creature
so
this
is
the
stage
he
said
to
lousteau
it
is
like
the
bookseller
s
shop
in
the
wooden
galleries
or
a
literary
paper
said
etienne
lousteau
it
is
a
kitchen
neither
more
nor
nathan
appeared
at
this
moment
what
brings
you
here
inquired
lousteau
why
i
am
doing
the
minor
theatres
for
the
until
something
better
turns
oh
come
to
supper
with
us
this
evening
speak
well
of
florine
and
i
will
do
as
much
for
very
much
at
your
service
returned
nathan
you
know
she
is
living
in
the
rue
du
bondy
lousteau
dear
boy
who
is
the
handsome
young
man
that
you
have
brought
with
you
asked
the
actress
now
returned
to
the
wings
a
great
poet
dear
that
will
have
a
famous
name
one
of
these
m
nathan
i
must
introduce
lucien
de
rubempre
to
you

monsieur
said
nathan
lucien
raoul
nathan
continued
etienne
i
read
your
book
two
days
ago
and
upon
my
word
i
can
not
understand
how
you
who
have
written
such
a
book
and
such
poetry
can
be
so
humble
to
a
wait
till
your
first
book
comes
out
said
nathan
and
a
shrewd
smile
flitted
over
his
face
i
say
i
say
here
are
ultras
and
liberals
actually
shaking
hands
cried
vernou
spying
the
trio
in
the
morning
i
hold
the
views
of
my
paper
said
nathan
in
the
evening
i
think
as
i
please

journalists

felicien
vernou
turned
to
lousteau
finot
is
looking
for
you
etienne
he
came
with
me
and
here
he
is
ah

the
by

a
place
in
the
house

there
asked
finot
you
will
always
find
a
place
in
our
hearts
said
the
actress
with
the
sweetest
smile
imaginable
i
say
my
little
florville
are
you
cured
already
of
your
fancy
they
told
me
that
a
russian
prince
had
carried
you
who
carries
off
women
in
these
days
said
florville
she
who
had
cried
stop
wretched
man
we
stayed
at
for
ten
days
and
my
prince
got
off
with
paying
the
forfeit
money
to
the
management
the
manager
will
go
down
on
his
knees
to
pray
for
some
more
russian
princes
florville
continued
laughing
the
forfeit
money
was
so
much
clear
and
as
for
you
child
said
finot
turning
to
a
pretty
girl
in
a
peasant
s
costume
where
did
you
steal
these
diamond
have
you
hooked
an
indian
prince
no
a
blacking
manufacturer
an
englishman
who
has
gone
off
already
it
is
not
everybody
who
can
find
millionaire
shopkeepers
tired
of
domestic
life
whenever
they
like
as
florine
does
and
coralie
aren
t
they
just
lucky
florville
you
will
make
a
bad
entry
said
lousteau
the
blacking
has
gone
to
your
head
if
you
want
a
success
said
nathan
instead
of
screaming
he
is
saved
like
a
fury
walk
on
quite
quietly
go
to
the
staircase
and
say
he
is
saved
in
a
chest
voice
like
pasta
s
in
there
go
along
and
he
pushed
her
towards
the
stage
it
is
too
late
said
vernou
the
effect
has
hung
what
did
she
do
the
house
is
applauding
like
mad
asked
lousteau
went
down
on
her
knees
and
showed
her
bosom
that
is
her
great
resource
said
the
s
widow
the
manager
is
giving
up
the
stage
box
to
us
you
will
find
me
there
when
you
come
said
finot
as
lousteau
walked
off
with
lucien
at
the
back
of
the
stage
through
a
labyrinth
of
scenery
and
corridors
the
pair
climbed
several
flights
of
stairs
and
reached
a
little
room
on
a
third
floor
nathan
and
felicien
vernou
following
them
or
gentlemen
said
florine
then
turning
to
a
short
stout
man
standing
in
a
corner
these
gentlemen
are
the
rulers
of
my
destiny
she
said
my
future
is
in
their
hands
but
they
will
be
under
our
table
morning
i
hope
if
lousteau
has
forgotten
nothing
forgotten
you
are
going
to
have
blondet
of
the
said
etienne
the
genuine
blondet
the
very
blondet
blondet
himself
in
oh
lousteau
you
dear
boy
stop
i
must
give
you
a
kiss
and
she
flung
her
arms
about
the
journalist
s
neck
matifat
the
stout
person
in
the
corner
looked
serious
at
this
florine
was
thin
her
beauty
like
a
bud
gave
promise
of
the
flower
to
come
the
girl
of
sixteen
could
only
delight
the
eyes
of
artists
who
prefer
the
sketch
to
the
picture
all
the
quick
subtlety
of
her
character
was
visible
in
the
features
of
the
charming
actress
who
at
that
time
might
have
sat
for
goethe
s
mignon
matifat
a
wealthy
druggist
of
the
rue
des
lombards
had
imagined
that
a
little
boulevard
actress
would
have
no
very
expensive
tastes
but
in
eleven
months
florine
had
cost
him
sixty
thousand
francs
nothing
seemed
more
extraordinary
to
lucien
than
the
sight
of
an
honest
and
worthy
merchant
standing
like
a
statue
of
the
god
terminus
in
the
actress
narrow
a
tiny
place
some
ten
feet
square
hung
with
a
pretty
and
adorned
with
a
mirror
a
sofa
and
two
chairs
there
was
a
fireplace
in
the
a
carpet
on
the
floor
and
cupboards
all
round
the
room
a
dresser
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
a
spanish
costume
for
florine
was
to
take
the
part
of
a
countess
in
an
imbroglio
that
girl
will
be
the
handsomest
actress
in
paris
in
five
years
time
said
nathan
turning
to
felicien
vernou
by
the
by
darlings
you
will
take
care
of
me
won
t
you
said
florine
turning
to
the
three
journalists
i
have
engaged
cabs
for
for
i
am
going
to
send
you
home
as
tipsy
as
shrove
tuesday
matifat
has
sent
in
wines
oh
wines
worthy
of
louis
and
engaged
the
prussian
ambassador
s
we
expect
something
enormous
from
the
look
of
the
gentleman
remarked
nathan
and
he
is
quite
aware
that
he
is
treating
the
most
dangerous
men
in
paris
added
florine
matifat
was
looking
uneasily
at
lucien
he
felt
jealous
of
the
young
man
s
good
looks
but
here
is
some
one
that
i
do
not
know
florine
continued
confronting
lucien
which
of
you
has
imported
the
apollo
belvedere
from
florence
he
is
as
charming
as
one
of
girodet
s
he
is
a
poet
mademoiselle
from
the
provinces
i
forgot
to
present
him
to
you
you
are
so
beautiful
that
you
put
the
guide
to
out
of
a
man
s
head
is
he
so
rich
that
he
can
afford
to
write
poetry
asked
florine
poor
as
job
said
lucien
it
is
a
great
temptation
for
some
of
us
said
the
actress
just
then
the
author
of
the
play
suddenly
entered
and
lucien
beheld
du
bruel
a
short
attenuated
young
man
in
an
overcoat
a
composite
human
blend
of
the
the
owner
of
and
the
stockbroker
florine
child
said
this
personage
are
you
sure
of
your
part
eh
no
slips
of
memory
you
know
and
mind
that
scene
in
the
second
act
make
the
irony
tell
bring
out
that
subtle
touch
say
i
do
not
love
you
just
as
we
why
do
you
take
parts
in
which
you
have
to
say
such
things
asked
matifat
the
druggist
s
remark
was
received
with
a
general
shout
of
laughter
what
does
it
matter
to
you
said
florine
so
long
as
i
don
t
say
such
things
to
you
great
stupid
oh
his
stupidity
is
the
pleasure
of
my
life
she
continued
glancing
at
the
journalist
upon
my
word
i
would
pay
him
so
much
for
every
blunder
if
it
would
not
be
the
ruin
of
yes
but
you
will
look
at
me
when
you
say
it
as
you
do
when
you
are
rehearsing
and
it
gives
me
a
turn
remonstrated
the
druggist
very
well
then
i
will
look
at
my
friend
lousteau
a
bell
rang
outside
in
the
passage
go
out
all
of
you
cried
florine
let
me
read
my
part
over
again
and
try
to
understand
lucien
and
lousteau
were
the
last
to
go
lousteau
set
a
kiss
on
florine
s
shoulder
and
lucien
heard
her
say
not
impossible
that
stupid
old
animal
told
his
wife
that
he
was
going
out
into
the
isn
t
she
charming
said
etienne
as
they
came
away
but
but
that
matifat
my
dear
fellow
oh
you
know
nothing
of
parisian
life
my
boy
some
things
can
not
be
helped
suppose
that
you
fell
in
love
with
a
married
woman
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
it
all
depends
on
the
way
that
you
look
at
etienne
and
lucien
entered
the
and
found
the
manager
there
with
finot
matifat
was
in
the
box
exactly
opposite
with
a
friend
of
his
a
named
camusot
coralie
s
protector
and
a
worthy
little
old
soul
his
all
three
of
these
city
men
were
polishing
their
and
anxiously
scanning
the
house
certain
symptoms
in
the
pit
appeared
to
disturb
them
the
usual
heterogeneous
elements
filled
the
boxes
journalists
and
their
mistresses
and
their
lovers
a
sprinkling
of
the
determined
playgoers
who
never
miss
a
first
night
if
they
can
help
it
and
a
very
few
people
of
fashion
who
care
for
this
sort
of
sensation
the
first
box
was
occupied
by
the
head
of
a
department
to
whom
du
bruel
maker
of
vaudevilles
owed
a
snug
little
sinecure
in
the
treasury
lucien
had
gone
from
surprise
to
surprise
since
the
dinner
at
flicoteaux
s
for
two
months
literature
had
meant
a
life
of
poverty
and
want
in
lousteau
s
room
he
had
seen
it
at
its
cynical
worst
in
the
wooden
galleries
he
had
met
literature
abject
and
literature
insolent
the
sharp
contrasts
of
heights
and
depths
of
compromise
with
conscience
of
supreme
power
and
want
of
principle
of
treachery
and
pleasure
of
mental
elevation
and
bondage
all
this
made
his
head
swim
he
seemed
to
be
watching
some
strange
drama
finot
was
talking
with
the
manager
do
you
think
du
bruel
s
piece
will
pay
he
asked
du
bruel
has
tried
to
do
something
in
beaumarchais
style
boulevard
audiences
don
t
care
for
that
kind
of
thing
they
like
harrowing
sensations
wit
is
not
much
appreciated
here
everything
depends
on
florine
and
coralie
they
are
bewitchingly
pretty
and
graceful
wear
very
short
skirts
and
dance
a
spanish
dance
and
possibly
they
may
carry
off
the
piece
with
the
public
the
whole
affair
is
a
gambling
speculation
a
few
clever
notices
in
the
papers
and
i
may
make
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
if
the
play
oh
come
it
will
only
be
a
moderate
success
i
can
see
said
finot
three
of
the
theatres
have
got
up
a
plot
continued
the
manager
they
will
even
hiss
the
piece
but
i
have
made
arrangements
to
defeat
their
kind
intentions
i
have
squared
the
men
in
their
pay
they
will
make
a
muddle
of
it
a
couple
of
city
men
yonder
have
taken
a
hundred
tickets
apiece
to
secure
a
triumph
for
florine
and
coralie
and
given
them
to
acquaintances
able
and
ready
to
act
as
chuckers
out
the
fellows
having
been
paid
twice
will
go
quietly
and
a
scene
of
that
sort
always
makes
a
good
impression
on
the
two
hundred
tickets
what
invaluable
men
exclaimed
finot
yes
with
two
more
actresses
as
handsomely
kept
as
florine
and
coralie
i
should
make
something
out
of
the
for
the
past
two
hours
the
word
money
had
been
sounding
in
lucien
s
ears
as
the
solution
of
every
difficulty
in
the
theatre
as
in
the
publishing
trade
and
in
the
publishing
trade
as
in
the
it
was
everywhere
the
same
there
was
not
a
word
of
art
or
of
glory
the
steady
beat
of
the
great
pendulum
money
seemed
to
fall
like
on
his
heart
and
brain
and
yet
while
the
orchestra
played
the
overture
while
the
pit
was
full
of
noisy
tumult
of
applause
and
hisses
unconsciously
he
drew
a
comparison
between
this
scene
and
others
that
came
up
in
his
mind
visions
arose
before
him
of
david
and
the
of
the
poetry
that
he
came
to
know
in
that
atmosphere
of
pure
peace
when
together
they
beheld
the
wonders
of
art
the
high
successes
of
genius
and
visions
of
glory
borne
on
stainless
wings
he
thought
of
the
evenings
spent
with
d
arthez
and
his
friends
and
tears
glittered
in
his
eyes
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
etienne
lousteau
i
see
poetry
fallen
into
the
ah
you
have
still
some
illusions
left
my
dear
is
there
nothing
for
it
but
to
cringe
and
submit
to
thickheads
like
matifat
and
camusot
as
actresses
bow
down
to
journalists
and
we
ourselves
to
the
booksellers
my
boy
do
you
see
that
fellow
said
etienne
lowering
his
voice
and
glancing
at
finot
he
has
neither
genius
nor
cleverness
but
he
is
covetous
he
means
to
make
a
fortune
at
all
costs
and
he
is
a
keen
man
of
business
didn
t
you
see
how
he
made
forty
per
cent
out
of
me
at
dauriat
s
and
talked
as
if
he
were
doing
me
a
favor
well
he
gets
letters
from
not
a
few
unknown
men
of
genius
who
go
down
on
their
knees
to
him
for
a
hundred
the
words
recalled
the
sketch
that
lay
on
the
table
in
the
editor
s
office
and
the
words
finot
my
hundred
francs
lucien
s
inmost
soul
shrank
from
the
man
in
disgust
i
would
sooner
die
he
said
sooner
live
retorted
etienne
the
curtain
rose
and
the
went
off
to
the
wings
to
give
orders
finot
turned
to
etienne
my
dear
fellow
dauriat
has
passed
his
word
i
am
proprietor
of
of
his
weekly
paper
i
have
agreed
to
give
thirty
thousand
francs
in
cash
on
condition
that
i
am
to
be
editor
and
director
tis
a
splendid
thing
blondet
told
me
that
the
government
intends
to
take
restrictive
measures
against
the
press
there
will
be
no
new
papers
allowed
in
six
months
time
it
will
cost
a
million
francs
to
start
a
new
journal
so
i
struck
a
bargain
though
i
have
only
ten
thousand
francs
in
hand
listen
to
me
if
you
can
sell
of
my
share
that
is
of
the
paper
to
matifat
for
thirty
thousand
francs
you
shall
be
editor
of
my
little
paper
with
a
salary
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
per
month
i
want
in
any
case
to
have
the
control
of
my
old
paper
and
to
keep
my
hold
upon
it
but
nobody
need
know
that
and
your
name
will
appear
as
editor
you
will
be
paid
at
the
rate
of
five
francs
per
column
you
need
not
pay
contributors
more
than
three
francs
and
you
keep
the
difference
that
means
another
four
hundred
and
fifty
francs
per
month
but
at
the
same
time
i
reserve
the
right
to
use
the
paper
to
attack
or
defend
men
or
causes
as
i
please
and
you
may
indulge
your
own
likes
and
dislikes
so
long
as
you
do
not
interfere
with
my
schemes
perhaps
i
may
be
a
ministerialist
perhaps
ultra
i
do
not
know
yet
but
i
mean
to
keep
up
my
connections
with
the
liberal
party
below
the
surface
i
can
speak
out
with
you
you
are
a
good
fellow
i
might
perhaps
give
you
the
chambers
to
do
for
another
paper
on
which
i
work
i
am
afraid
i
can
scarcely
keep
on
with
it
now
so
let
florine
do
this
bit
of
jockeying
tell
her
to
put
the
screw
on
her
druggist
if
i
can
t
find
the
money
within
hours
i
must
cry
off
my
bargain
dauriat
sold
another
third
to
his
printer
and
for
thirty
thousand
francs
so
he
has
his
own
third
and
ten
thousand
francs
to
the
good
for
he
only
gave
fifty
thousand
for
the
whole
affair
and
in
another
year
s
time
the
magazine
will
be
worth
two
hundred
thousand
francs
if
the
court
buys
it
up
if
the
court
has
the
good
sense
to
suppress
newspapers
as
they
you
are
lucky
said
lousteau
if
you
had
gone
through
all
that
i
have
endured
you
would
not
say
that
of
me
i
had
my
fill
of
misery
in
those
days
you
see
and
there
was
no
help
for
it
my
father
is
a
hatter
he
still
keeps
a
shop
in
the
rue
du
coq
nothing
but
millions
of
money
or
a
social
cataclysm
can
open
out
the
way
to
my
goal
and
of
the
two
alternatives
i
don
t
know
now
that
the
revolution
is
not
the
easier
if
i
bore
your
friend
s
name
i
should
have
a
chance
to
get
on
hush
here
comes
the
manager
and
finot
rose
to
his
feet
i
am
going
to
the
opera
i
shall
very
likely
have
a
duel
on
my
hands
for
i
have
put

a
terrific
attack
on
a
couple
of
dancers
under
the
protection
of
two
generals

am
giving
it
them
hot
and
strong
at
the
aha

the
manager

off
a
box
and

declining

month

the
manager

not
much
hurt
with
your
ten
subscriptions
i
had
two
good
notices
put
into
the
oh
i
am
not
complaining
of
you
cried
the
manager
till
evening
lousteau
said
finot
you
can
give
me
your
answer
at
the
francais
there
is
a
new
piece
on
there
and
as
i
shall
not
be
able
to
write
the
notice
you
can
take
my
box
i
will
give
you
preference
you
have
worked
yourself
to
death
for
me
and
i
am
grateful
felicien
vernou
offered
twenty
thousand
francs
for
a
third
share
of
my
little
paper
and
to
work
without
a
salary
for
a
twelvemonth
but
i
want
to
be
absolute
master
he
is
not
named
finot
slyboots
for
nothing
said
lucien
he
is
a
that
will
get
on
in
the
world
said
etienne
careless
whether
the
wily
schemer
overheard
the
remark
or
not
as
he
shut
the
door
of
the
box
said
the
manager
he
will
be
a
millionaire
he
will
enjoy
the
respect
of
all
who
know
him
he
may
perhaps
have
friends
some
day
good
heavens
what
a
den
said
lucien
and
are
you
going
to
drag
that
excellent
creature
into
such
a
business
he
continued
looking
at
florine
who
gave
them
side
glances
from
the
stage
she
will
carry
it
through
too
you
do
not
know
the
devotion
and
the
wiles
of
these
beloved
beings
said
lousteau
they
redeem
their
failings
and
expiate
all
their
sins
by
boundless
love
when
they
love
said
the
manager
a
great
love
is
all
the
grander
in
an
actress
by
reason
of
its
violent
contrast
with
her
and
he
who
finds
it
finds
a
diamond
worthy
of
the
proudest
crown
lying
in
the
mud
returned
lousteau
but
coralie
is
not
attending
to
her
part
remarked
the
manager
coralie
is
smitten
with
our
friend
here
all
unsuspicious
of
his
conquest
and
coralie
will
make
a
fiasco
she
is
missing
her
cues
this
is
the
second
time
she
had
not
heard
the
prompter
pray
go
into
the
corner
monsieur
he
continued
if
coralie
is
smitten
with
you
i
will
go
and
tell
her
that
you
have
left
the
no
no
cried
lousteau
tell
coralie
that
this
gentleman
is
coming
to
supper
and
that
she
can
do
as
she
likes
with
him
and
she
will
play
like
mlle
the
manager
went
and
lucien
turned
to
etienne
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
ask
that
druggist
through
mlle
florine
to
pay
thirty
thousand
francs
for
a
share
when
finot
gave
no
more
for
the
whole
of
it
and
ask
without
the
slightest
scruple
lousteau
interrupted
lucien
before
he
had
time
to
finish
his
expostulation
my
dear
boy
what
country
can
you
come
from
the
druggist
is
not
a
man
he
is
a
strong
box
delivered
into
our
hands
by
his
fancy
for
an
how
about
your
conscience
conscience
my
dear
fellow
is
a
stick
which
every
one
takes
up
to
beat
his
neighbor
and
not
for
application
to
his
own
back
come
now
who
the
devil
are
you
angry
with
in
one
day
chance
has
worked
a
miracle
for
you
a
miracle
for
which
i
have
been
waiting
these
two
years
and
you
must
needs
amuse
yourself
by
finding
fault
with
the
means
what
you
appear
to
me
to
possess
intelligence
you
seem
to
be
in
a
fair
way
to
reach
that
freedom
from
prejudice
which
is
a
first
necessity
to
intellectual
adventurers
in
the
world
we
live
in
and
are
you
wallowing
in
scruples
worthy
of
a
nun
who
accuses
herself
of
eating
an
egg
with
concupiscence
if
florine
succeeds
i
shall
be
editor
of
a
newspaper
with
a
fixed
salary
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
per
month
i
shall
take
the
important
plays
and
leave
the
vaudevilles
to
vernou
and
you
can
take
my
place
and
do
the
boulevard
theatres
and
so
get
a
foot
in
the
stirrup
you
will
make
three
francs
per
column
and
write
a
column
a
day
thirty
columns
a
month
means
ninety
francs
you
will
have
some
sixty
francs
worth
of
books
to
sell
to
barbet
and
lastly
you
can
demand
ten
tickets
a
month
of
each
of
your
theatres
that
is
forty
tickets
in
all
and
sell
them
for
forty
francs
to
a
barbet
who
deals
in
them
i
will
introduce
you
to
the
man
so
you
will
have
two
hundred
francs
coming
in
every
month
then
if
you
make
yourself
useful
to
finot
you
might
get
a
hundred
francs
for
an
article
in
this
new
weekly
review
of
his
in
which
case
you
would
show
uncommon
talent
for
all
the
articles
are
signed
and
you
can
not
put
in
work
as
you
can
on
a
small
paper
in
that
case
you
would
be
making
a
hundred
crowns
a
month
now
my
dear
boy
there
are
men
of
ability
like
that
poor
d
arthez
who
dines
at
flicoteaux
s
every
day
who
may
wait
for
ten
years
before
they
will
make
a
hundred
crowns
and
you
will
be
making
four
thousand
francs
a
year
by
your
pen
to
say
nothing
of
the
books
you
will
write
for
the
trade
if
you
do
work
of
that
kind
now
a
s
salary
only
amounts
to
a
thousand
crowns
and
there
he
stops
in
his
arrondissement
wearing
away
time
like
the
rung
of
a
chair
i
say
nothing
of
the
pleasure
of
going
to
the
theatre
without
paying
for
your
seat
for
that
is
a
delight
which
quickly
palls
but
you
can
go
behind
the
scenes
in
four
theatres
be
hard
and
sarcastic
for
a
month
or
two
and
you
will
be
simply
overwhelmed
with
invitations
from
actresses
and
their
adorers
will
pay
court
to
you
you
will
only
dine
at
flicoteaux
s
when
you
happen
to
have
less
than
thirty
sous
in
your
pocket
and
no
dinner
engagement
at
the
luxembourg
at
five
o
clock
you
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
now
you
are
on
the
eve
of
entering
a
privileged
class
you
will
be
one
of
the
hundred
persons
who
tell
france
what
to
think
in
three
days
time
if
all
goes
well
you
can
if
you
choose
make
a
man
s
life
a
curse
to
him
by
putting
thirty
jokes
at
his
expense
in
print
at
the
rate
of
three
a
day
you
can
if
you
choose
draw
a
revenue
of
pleasure
from
the
actresses
at
your
theatres
you
can
wreck
a
good
play
and
send
all
paris
running
after
a
bad
one
if
dauriat
declines
to
pay
you
for
your
you
can
make
him
come
to
you
and
meekly
and
humbly
implore
you
to
take
two
thousand
francs
for
them
if
you
have
the
ability
and
knock
off
two
or
three
articles
that
threaten
to
spoil
some
of
dauriat
s
speculations
or
to
ruin
a
book
on
which
he
counts
you
will
see
him
come
climbing
up
your
stairs
like
a
clematis
and
always
at
the
door
of
your
dwelling
as
for
your
novel
the
booksellers
who
would
show
you
more
or
less
politely
to
the
door
at
this
moment
will
be
standing
outside
your
attic
in
a
string
and
the
value
of
the
manuscript
which
old
doguereau
valued
at
four
hundred
francs
will
rise
to
four
thousand
these
are
the
advantages
of
the
journalist
s
profession
so
let
us
do
our
best
to
keep
all
newcomers
out
of
it
it
needs
an
immense
amount
of
brains
to
make
your
way
and
a
still
greater
amount
of
luck
and
here
are
you
quibbling
over
your
good
fortune
if
we
had
not
met
you
see
at
flicoteaux
s
you
might
have
danced
attendance
on
the
booksellers
for
another
three
years
or
starved
like
d
arthez
in
a
garret
by
the
time
that
d
arthez
is
as
learned
as
bayle
and
as
great
a
writer
of
prose
as
rousseau
we
shall
have
made
our
fortunes
you
and
i
and
we
shall
hold
his
in
our
hands
wealth
and
fame
to
give
or
to
hold
finot
will
be
a
deputy
and
proprietor
of
a
great
newspaper
and
we
shall
be
whatever
we
meant
to
be
peers
of
france
or
prisoner
for
debt
in
so
finot
will
sell
his
paper
to
the
highest
bidder
among
the
ministers
just
as
he
sells
favorable
notices
to
mme
bastienne
and
runs
down
mlle
virginie
saying
that
mme
bastienne
s
bonnets
are
superior
to
the
millinery
which
they
praised
at
first
said
lucien
recollecting
that
scene
in
the
office
my
dear
fellow
you
are
a
simpleton
lousteau
remarked
drily
three
years
ago
finot
was
walking
on
the
uppers
of
his
boots
dining
for
eighteen
sous
at
tabar
s
and
knocking
off
a
tradesman
s
prospectus
when
he
could
get
it
for
ten
francs
his
clothes
hung
together
by
some
miracle
as
mysterious
as
the
immaculate
conception
finot
has
a
paper
of
his
own
worth
about
a
hundred
thousand
francs
what
with
subscribers
who
pay
and
take
no
copies
genuine
subscriptions
and
indirect
taxes
levied
by
his
uncle
he
is
making
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
he
dines
most
sumptuously
every
day
he
has
set
up
a
cabriolet
within
the
last
month
and
now
at
last
behold
him
the
editor
of
a
weekly
review
with
a
sixth
share
for
which
he
will
not
pay
a
penny
a
salary
of
five
hundred
francs
per
month
and
another
thousand
francs
for
supplying
matter
which
costs
him
nothing
and
for
which
the
firm
pays
you
yourself
to
begin
with
if
finot
consents
to
pay
you
fifty
francs
per
sheet
will
be
only
too
glad
to
let
him
have
two
or
three
articles
for
nothing
when
you
are
in
his
position
you
can
judge
finot
a
man
can
only
be
tried
by
his
peers
and
for
you
is
there
not
an
immense
future
opening
out
before
you
if
you
will
blindly
minister
to
his
enmity
attack
at
finot
s
bidding
and
praise
when
he
gives
the
word
suppose
that
you
yourself
wish
to
be
revenged
upon
somebody
you
can
break
a
foe
or
friend
on
the
wheel
you
have
only
to
say
to
me
lousteau
let
us
put
an
end
to
and
we
will
kill
him
by
a
phrase
put
in
the
paper
morning
by
morning
and
afterwards
you
can
slay
the
slain
with
a
solemn
article
in
finot
s
weekly
indeed
if
it
is
a
matter
of
capital
importance
to
you
finot
would
allow
you
to
bludgeon
your
man
in
a
big
paper
with
ten
or
twelve
thousand
subscribers
you
make
yourself
indispensable
to
then
are
you
sure
that
florine
can
bring
her
druggist
to
make
the
bargain
asked
lucien
dazzled
by
these
prospects
quite
sure
now
comes
the
interval
i
will
go
and
tell
her
everything
at
once
in
a
word
or
two
it
will
be
settled
if
florine
once
has
her
lesson
by
heart
she
will
have
all
my
wit
and
her
own
and
there
sits
that
honest
tradesman
gaping
with
admiration
at
florine
little
suspecting
that
you
are
about
to
get
thirty
thousand
francs
out
of
him
more
twaddle
anybody
might
think
that
the
man
was
going
to
be
robbed
cried
lousteau
why
my
dear
boy
if
the
minister
buys
the
newspaper
the
druggist
may
make
twenty
thousand
francs
in
six
months
on
an
investment
of
thirty
thousand
matifat
is
not
looking
at
the
newspaper
but
at
florine
s
prospects
as
soon
as
it
is
known
that
matifat
and
camusot
for
they
will
go
shares
that
matifat
and
camusot
are
proprietors
of
a
review
the
newspapers
will
be
full
of
friendly
notices
of
florine
and
coralie
florine
s
name
will
be
made
she
will
perhaps
obtain
an
engagement
in
another
theatre
with
a
salary
of
twelve
thousand
francs
in
fact
matifat
will
save
a
thousand
francs
every
month
in
dinners
and
presents
to
journalists
you
know
nothing
of
men
nor
of
the
way
things
are
poor
man
said
lucien
he
is
looking
forward
to
an
evening
s
and
he
will
be
sawn
in
two
with
arguments
until
florine
sees
finot
s
receipt
for
a
sixth
share
of
the
paper
and
i
shall
be
editor
of
finot
s
paper
and
making
a
thousand
francs
a
month
the
end
of
my
troubles
is
in
sight
cried
florine
s
lover
lousteau
went
out
and
lucien
sat
like
one
bewildered
lost
in
the
infinite
of
thought
soaring
above
this
everyday
world
in
the
wooden
galleries
he
had
seen
the
wires
by
which
the
trade
in
books
is
moved
he
has
seen
something
of
the
kitchen
where
great
reputations
are
made
he
had
been
behind
the
scenes
he
had
seen
the
seamy
side
of
life
the
consciences
of
men
involved
in
the
machinery
of
paris
the
mechanism
of
it
all
as
he
watched
florine
on
the
stage
he
almost
envied
lousteau
his
good
fortune
already
for
a
few
moments
he
had
forgotten
matifat
in
the
background
he
was
not
left
alone
for
long
perhaps
for
not
more
than
five
minutes
but
those
minutes
seemed
an
eternity
thoughts
rose
within
him
that
set
his
soul
on
fire
as
the
spectacle
on
the
stage
had
heated
his
senses
he
looked
at
the
women
with
their
wanton
eyes
all
the
brighter
for
the
red
paint
on
their
cheeks
at
the
gleaming
bare
necks
the
luxuriant
forms
outlined
by
the
lascivious
folds
of
the
basquina
the
very
short
skirts
that
displayed
as
much
as
possible
of
limbs
encased
in
scarlet
stockings
with
green
clocks
to
them
a
disquieting
vision
for
the
pit
a
double
process
of
corruption
was
working
within
him
in
parallel
lines
like
two
channels
that
will
spread
sooner
or
later
in
flood
time
and
make
one
that
corruption
was
eating
into
lucien
s
soul
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
corner
staring
vacantly
at
the
curtain
one
arm
resting
on
the
crimson
velvet
cushion
and
his
hand
drooping
over
the
edge
he
felt
the
fascination
of
the
life
that
was
offered
to
him
of
the
gleams
of
light
among
its
clouds
and
this
so
much
the
more
keenly
because
it
shone
out
like
a
blaze
of
fireworks
against
the
blank
darkness
of
his
own
obscure
monotonous
days
of
toil
suddenly
his
listless
eyes
became
aware
of
a
burning
glance
that
reached
him
through
a
rent
in
the
curtain
and
roused
him
from
his
lethargy
those
were
coralie
s
eyes
that
glowed
upon
him
he
lowered
his
head
and
looked
across
at
camusot
who
just
then
entered
the
opposite
box
that
amateur
was
a
worthy
of
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
stout
and
substantial
a
judge
in
the
commercial
court
a
father
of
four
children
and
the
husband
of
a
second
wife
at
the
age
of
with
a
cap
of
gray
hair
on
his
head
he
had
the
smug
appearance
of
a
man
who
has
his
eighty
thousand
francs
of
income
and
having
been
forced
to
put
up
with
a
good
deal
that
he
did
not
like
in
the
way
of
business
has
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
his
life
and
not
to
quit
this
earth
until
he
has
had
his
share
of
cakes
and
ale
a
brow
the
color
of
fresh
butter
and
florid
cheeks
like
a
monk
s
jowl
seemed
scarcely
big
enough
to
contain
his
exuberant
jubilation
camusot
had
left
his
wife
at
home
and
they
were
applauding
coralie
to
the
skies
all
the
rich
man
s
citizen
vanity
was
summed
up
and
gratified
in
coralie
in
coralie
s
lodging
he
gave
himself
the
airs
of
a
great
lord
of
a
bygone
day
now
at
this
moment
he
felt
that
half
of
her
success
was
his
the
knowledge
that
he
had
paid
for
it
confirmed
him
in
this
idea
camusot
s
conduct
was
sanctioned
by
the
presence
of
his
a
little
old
fogy
with
powdered
hair
and
leering
eyes
highly
respected
nevertheless
again
lucien
felt
disgust
rising
within
him
he
thought
of
the
year
when
he
loved
mme
de
bargeton
with
an
exalted
and
disinterested
love
and
at
that
thought
love
as
a
poet
understands
it
spread
its
white
wings
about
him
countless
memories
drew
a
circle
of
distant
blue
horizon
about
the
great
man
of
angouleme
and
again
he
fell
to
dreaming
up
went
the
curtain
and
there
stood
coralie
and
florine
upon
the
stage
he
is
thinking
about
as
much
of
you
as
of
the
grand
turk
my
dear
girl
florine
said
in
an
aside
while
coralie
was
finishing
her
speech
lucien
could
not
help
laughing
he
looked
at
coralie
she
was
one
of
the
most
charming
and
captivating
actresses
in
paris
rivaling
mme
perrin
and
mlle
fleuriet
and
destined
likewise
to
share
their
fate
coralie
was
a
woman
of
a
type
that
exerts
at
will
a
power
of
fascination
over
men
with
an
oval
face
of
deep
ivory
tint
a
mouth
red
as
a
pomegranate
and
a
chin
subtly
delicate
in
its
contour
as
the
edge
of
a
porcelain
cup
coralie
was
a
jewess
of
the
sublime
type
the
jet
black
eyes
behind
their
curving
lashes
seemed
to
scorch
her
eyelids
you
could
guess
how
soft
they
might
grow
or
how
sparks
of
the
heat
of
the
desert
might
flash
from
them
in
response
to
a
summons
from
within
the
circles
of
olive
shadow
about
them
were
bounded
by
thick
arching
lines
of
eyebrow
magnificent
mental
power
amounting
to
genius
seemed
to
dwell
in
the
swarthy
forehead
beneath
the
double
curve
of
ebony
hair
that
lay
upon
it
like
a
crown
and
gleamed
in
the
light
like
a
varnished
surface
but
like
many
another
actress
coralie
had
little
wit
in
spite
of
her
aptness
at
greenroom
repartee
and
scarcely
any
education
in
spite
of
her
boudoir
experience
her
brain
was
prompted
by
her
senses
her
kindness
was
the
impulsive
of
girls
of
her
class
but
who
could
trouble
over
coralie
s
psychology
when
his
eyes
were
dazzled
by
those
smooth
round
arms
of
hers
the
fingers
the
fair
white
shoulders
and
breast
celebrated
in
the
song
of
songs
the
flexible
curving
lines
of
throat
the
graciously
moulded
outlines
beneath
the
scarlet
silk
stockings
and
this
beauty
worthy
of
an
eastern
poet
was
brought
into
relief
by
the
conventional
spanish
costume
of
the
stage
coralie
was
the
delight
of
the
pit
all
eyes
dwelt
on
the
outlines
moulded
by
the
clinging
folds
of
her
bodice
and
lingered
over
the
andalusian
contour
of
the
hips
from
which
her
skirt
hung
fluttering
wantonly
with
every
movement
to
lucien
watching
this
creature
who
played
for
him
alone
caring
no
more
for
camusot
than
a
in
the
gallery
cares
for
an
there
came
a
moment
when
he
set
desire
above
love
and
enjoyment
above
desire
and
the
demon
of
lust
stirred
strange
thoughts
in
him
i
know
nothing
of
the
love
that
wallows
in
luxury
and
wine
and
sensual
pleasure
he
said
within
himself
i
have
lived
more
with
ideas
than
with
realities
you
must
pass
through
all
experience
if
you
mean
to
render
all
experience
this
will
be
my
first
great
supper
my
first
orgy
in
a
new
and
strange
world
why
should
i
not
know
for
once
the
delights
which
the
great
lords
of
the
eighteenth
century
sought
so
eagerly
of
wantons
of
the
opera
must
one
not
first
learn
of
courtesans
and
actresses
the
delights
the
perfections
the
transports
the
resources
the
subtleties
of
love
if
only
to
translate
them
afterwards
into
the
regions
of
a
higher
love
than
this
and
what
is
all
this
after
all
but
the
poetry
of
the
senses
two
months
ago
these
women
seemed
to
me
to
be
goddesses
guarded
by
dragons
that
no
one
dared
approach
i
was
envying
lousteau
just
now
but
here
is
another
handsomer
than
florine
why
should
i
not
profit
by
her
fancy
when
the
greatest
nobles
buy
a
night
with
such
women
with
their
richest
treasures
when
ambassadors
set
foot
in
these
depths
they
fling
aside
all
thought
of
yesterday
or
i
should
be
a
fool
to
be
more
squeamish
than
princes
especially
as
i
love
no
one
as
lucien
had
quite
forgotten
camusot
to
lousteau
he
had
expressed
the
utmost
disgust
for
this
most
hateful
of
all
partitions
and
now
he
himself
had
sunk
to
the
same
level
and
carried
away
by
the
casuistry
of
his
vehement
desire
had
given
the
reins
to
his
fancy
coralie
is
raving
about
you
said
lousteau
as
he
came
in
your
countenance
worthy
of
the
greatest
greek
sculptors
has
worked
unutterable
havoc
behind
the
scenes
you
are
in
luck
my
dear
boy
coralie
is
eighteen
years
old
and
in
a
few
days
time
she
may
be
making
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
by
her
beauty
she
is
an
honest
girl
still
since
her
mother
sold
her
three
years
ago
for
sixty
thousand
francs
she
has
tried
to
find
happiness
and
found
nothing
but
annoyance
she
took
to
the
stage
in
a
desperate
mood
she
has
a
horror
of
her
first
purchaser
de
marsay
and
when
she
came
out
of
the
galleys
for
the
king
of
dandies
soon
dropped
her
she
picked
up
old
camusot
she
does
not
care
much
about
him
but
he
is
like
a
father
to
her
and
she
endures
him
and
his
love
several
times
already
she
has
refused
the
handsomest
proposals
she
is
faithful
to
camusot
who
lets
her
live
in
peace
so
you
are
her
first
love
the
first
sight
of
you
went
to
her
heart
like
a
florine
has
gone
to
her
to
bring
the
girl
to
reason
she
is
crying
over
your
cruelty
she
has
forgotten
her
part
the
play
will
go
to
pieces
and
to
the
engagement
at
the
gymnase
which
camusot
had
planned
for
pooh
poor
thing
said
lucien
every
instinct
of
vanity
was
tickled
by
the
words
he
felt
his
heart
swell
high
with
more
adventures
have
befallen
me
in
this
one
evening
my
dear
fellow
than
in
all
the
first
eighteen
years
of
my
and
lucien
related
the
history
of
his
love
affairs
with
mme
de
bargeton
and
of
the
cordial
hatred
he
bore
the
baron
du
chatelet
stay
though
the
newspaper
wants
a
we
will
take
him
up
the
baron
is
a
buck
of
the
empire
and
a
ministerialist
he
is
the
man
for
us
i
have
seen
him
many
a
time
at
the
opera
i
can
see
your
great
lady
as
i
sit
here
she
is
often
in
the
marquise
d
espard
s
box
the
baron
is
paying
court
to
your
lady
love
a
cuttlefish
bone
that
she
is
wait
finot
has
just
sent
a
special
messenger
round
to
say
that
they
are
short
of
copy
at
the
office
young
hector
merlin
has
left
them
in
the
lurch
because
they
did
not
pay
for
white
lines
finot
in
despair
is
knocking
off
an
article
against
the
opera
well
now
my
dear
fellow
you
can
do
this
play
listen
to
it
and
think
it
over
and
i
will
go
to
the
manager
s
office
and
think
out
three
columns
about
your
man
and
your
disdainful
fair
one
they
will
be
in
no
pleasant
predicament
so
this
is
how
a
newspaper
is
written
said
lucien
it
is
always
like
this
answered
lousteau
these
ten
months
that
i
have
been
a
journalist
they
have
always
run
short
of
copy
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
manuscript
sent
to
the
printer
is
spoken
of
as
copy
doubtless
because
the
writers
are
supposed
to
send
in
a
fair
copy
of
their
work
or
possibly
the
word
is
ironically
derived
from
the
latin
word
for
copy
is
invariably
scarce
we
always
mean
to
have
a
few
numbers
ready
in
advance
a
grand
idea
that
will
never
be
realized
continued
lousteau
it
is
ten
o
clock
you
see
and
not
a
line
has
been
written
i
shall
ask
vernou
and
nathan
for
a
score
of
epigrams
on
deputies
or
on
chancellor
cruzoe
or
on
the
ministry
or
on
friends
of
ours
if
it
needs
must
be
a
man
in
this
pass
would
slaughter
his
parent
just
as
a
privateer
will
load
his
guns
with
silver
pieces
taken
out
of
the
booty
sooner
than
perish
write
a
brilliant
article
and
you
will
make
brilliant
progress
in
finot
s
estimation
for
finot
has
a
lively
sense
of
benefits
to
come
and
that
sort
of
gratitude
is
better
than
any
kind
of
pledge
pawntickets
always
excepted
for
they
invariably
represent
something
what
kind
of
men
can
journalists
be
are
you
to
sit
down
at
a
table
and
be
witty
to
order
just
exactly
as
a
lamp
begins
to
burn
when
you
apply
a
match
so
long
as
there
is
any
oil
in
lousteau
s
hand
was
on
the
lock
when
du
bruel
came
in
with
the
manager
permit
me
monsieur
to
take
a
message
to
coralie
allow
me
to
tell
her
that
you
will
go
home
with
her
after
supper
or
my
play
will
be
ruined
the
wretched
girl
does
not
know
what
she
is
doing
or
saying
she
will
cry
when
she
ought
to
laugh
and
laugh
when
she
ought
to
cry
she
has
been
hissed
once
already
you
can
still
save
the
piece
and
after
all
pleasure
is
not
a
i
am
not
accustomed
to
rivals
sir
lucien
answered
pray
don
t
tell
her
that
cried
the
manager
coralie
is
just
the
girl
to
fling
camusot
overboard
and
ruin
herself
in
good
earnest
the
proprietor
of
the
worthy
man
allows
her
two
thousand
francs
a
month
and
pays
for
all
her
dresses
and
as
your
promise
pledges
me
to
nothing
save
your
play
said
lucien
with
a
sultan
s
airs
but
don
t
look
as
if
you
meant
to
snub
that
charming
creature
pleaded
du
bruel
dear
me
am
i
to
write
the
notice
of
your
play
and
smile
on
your
heroine
as
well
exclaimed
the
poet
the
author
vanished
with
a
signal
to
coralie
who
began
to
act
forthwith
in
a
marvelous
way
vignol
who
played
the
part
of
the
alcalde
and
revealed
for
the
first
time
his
genius
as
an
actor
of
old
men
came
forward
amid
a
storm
of
applause
to
make
an
announcement
to
the
house
the
piece
which
we
have
the
honor
of
playing
for
you
this
evening
gentlemen
is
the
work
of
mm
raoul
and
de
why
nathan
is
partly
responsible
said
lousteau
i
don
t
wonder
that
he
looked
shouted
the
enraptured
house
florine
too
roared
a
voice
of
thunder
from
the
opposite
box
and
other
voices
took
up
the
cry
florine
and
coralie
the
curtain
rose
vignol
reappeared
between
the
two
actresses
matifat
and
camusot
flung
wreaths
on
the
stage
and
coralie
stooped
for
her
flowers
and
held
them
out
to
lucien
for
him
those
two
hours
spent
in
the
theatre
seemed
to
be
a
dream
the
spell
that
held
him
had
begun
to
work
when
he
went
behind
the
scenes
and
in
spite
of
its
horrors
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
its
sensuality
and
dissolute
morals
had
affected
the
poet
s
still
untainted
nature
a
sort
of
malaria
that
infects
the
soul
seems
to
lurk
among
those
dark
filthy
passages
filled
with
machinery
and
lit
with
smoky
greasy
lamps
the
solemnity
and
reality
of
life
disappear
the
most
sacred
things
are
matter
for
a
jest
the
most
impossible
things
seem
to
be
true
lucien
felt
as
if
he
had
taken
some
narcotic
and
coralie
had
completed
the
work
he
plunged
into
this
joyous
intoxication
the
lights
in
the
great
chandelier
were
extinguished
there
was
no
one
left
in
the
house
except
the
boxkeepers
busy
taking
away
footstools
and
shutting
doors
the
noises
echoing
strangely
through
the
empty
theatre
the
footlights
blown
out
as
one
candle
sent
up
a
fetid
reek
of
smoke
the
curtain
rose
again
a
lantern
was
lowered
from
the
ceiling
and
firemen
and
stage
carpenters
departed
on
their
rounds
the
fairy
scenes
of
the
stage
the
rows
of
fair
faces
in
the
boxes
the
dazzling
lights
the
magical
illusion
of
new
scenery
and
costume
had
all
disappeared
and
dismal
darkness
emptiness
and
cold
reigned
in
their
stead
it
was
hideous
lucien
sat
on
in
bewilderment
well
are
you
coming
my
boy
lousteau
s
voice
called
from
the
stage
jump
lucien
sprang
over
he
scarcely
recognized
florine
and
coralie
in
their
ordinary
quilted
paletots
and
cloaks
with
their
faces
hidden
by
hats
and
thick
black
veils
two
butterflies
returned
to
the
chrysalis
stage
could
not
be
more
completely
transformed
will
you
honor
me
by
giving
me
your
arm
coralie
asked
tremulously
with
pleasure
said
lucien
he
could
feel
the
beating
of
her
heart
throbbing
against
his
like
some
snared
bird
as
she
nestled
closely
to
his
side
with
something
of
the
delight
of
a
cat
that
rubs
herself
against
her
master
with
eager
silken
caresses
so
we
are
supping
together
she
said
the
party
of
four
found
two
cabs
waiting
for
them
at
the
door
in
the
rue
des
coralie
drew
lucien
to
one
of
the
two
in
which
camusot
and
his
old
cardot
were
seated
already
she
offered
du
bruel
a
fifth
place
and
the
manager
drove
off
with
florine
matifat
and
lousteau
these
hackney
cabs
are
abominable
things
said
coralie
why
don
t
you
have
a
carriage
returned
du
bruel
she
asked
pettishly
i
do
not
like
to
tell
you
before
cardot
s
face
for
he
trained
his
no
doubt
would
you
believe
it
little
and
old
as
he
is
cardot
only
gives
florine
five
hundred
francs
a
month
just
about
enough
to
pay
for
her
rent
and
her
grub
and
her
clothes
the
old
marquis
de
rochegude
offered
me
a
brougham
two
months
ago
and
he
has
six
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
but
i
am
an
artist
and
not
a
common
you
shall
have
a
carriage
the
day
after
miss
said
camusot
benignly
you
never
asked
me
for
as
if
one
for
such
a
thing
as
that
what
you
love
a
woman
and
let
her
paddle
about
in
the
mud
at
the
risk
of
breaking
her
legs
nobody
but
a
knight
of
the
yardstick
likes
to
see
a
draggled
skirt
as
she
uttered
the
sharp
words
that
cut
camusot
to
the
quick
she
groped
for
lucien
s
knee
and
pressed
it
against
her
own
and
clasped
her
fingers
upon
his
hand
she
was
silent
all
her
power
to
feel
seemed
to
be
concentrated
upon
the
ineffable
joy
of
a
moment
which
brings
compensation
for
the
whole
wretched
past
of
a
life
such
as
these
poor
creatures
lead
and
develops
within
their
souls
a
poetry
of
which
other
women
happily
ignorant
of
these
violent
revulsions
know
nothing
you
played
like
mlle
mars
herself
towards
the
end
said
du
bruel
yes
said
camusot
something
put
her
out
at
the
beginning
but
from
the
middle
of
the
second
act
to
the
very
end
she
was
enough
to
drive
you
wild
with
admiration
half
of
the
success
of
your
play
was
due
to
and
half
of
her
success
is
due
to
me
said
du
bruel
this
is
all
much
ado
about
nothing
said
coralie
in
an
unfamiliar
voice
and
seizing
an
opportunity
in
the
darkness
she
carried
lucien
s
hand
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
and
drenched
it
with
tears
lucien
felt
thrilled
through
and
through
by
that
touch
for
in
the
humility
of
the
courtesan
s
love
there
is
a
magnificence
which
might
set
an
example
to
angels
are
you
writing
the
dramatic
criticism
monsieur
said
du
bruel
addressing
lucien
you
can
write
a
charming
paragraph
about
our
dear
oh
do
us
that
little
service
pleaded
camusot
down
on
his
knees
metaphorically
speaking
before
the
critic
you
will
always
find
me
ready
to
do
you
a
good
turn
at
any
do
leave
him
his
independence
coralie
exclaimed
angrily
he
will
write
what
he
pleases
papa
camusot
buy
carriages
for
me
instead
of
you
shall
have
them
on
very
easy
terms
lucien
answered
politely
i
have
never
written
for
newspapers
before
so
i
am
not
accustomed
to
their
ways
my
maiden
pen
is
at
your
disposal
that
is
funny
said
du
bruel
here
we
are
in
the
rue
de
bondy
said
cardot
coralie
s
sally
had
quite
crushed
the
little
old
man
if
you
are
giving
me
the
first
fruits
of
your
pen
the
first
love
that
has
sprung
up
in
my
heart
shall
be
yours
whispered
coralie
in
the
brief
instant
that
they
remained
alone
together
in
the
cab
then
she
went
up
to
florine
s
bedroom
to
change
her
dress
for
a
toilette
previously
sent
lucien
had
no
idea
how
lavishly
a
prosperous
merchant
will
spend
money
upon
an
actress
or
a
mistress
when
he
means
to
enjoy
a
life
of
pleasure
matifat
was
not
nearly
so
rich
a
man
as
his
friend
camusot
and
he
had
done
his
part
rather
shabbily
yet
the
sight
of
the
took
lucien
by
surprise
the
walls
were
hung
with
green
cloth
with
a
border
of
gilded
nails
the
whole
room
was
artistically
decorated
lighted
by
handsome
lamps
stands
full
of
flowers
stood
in
every
direction
the
was
resplendent
with
the
furniture
in
fashion
in
those
days
a
thomire
chandelier
a
carpet
of
eastern
design
and
yellow
silken
hangings
relieved
by
a
brown
border
the
candlesticks
and
clock
were
all
in
good
taste
for
matifat
had
left
everything
to
grindot
a
rising
architect
who
was
building
a
house
for
him
and
the
young
man
had
taken
great
pains
with
the
rooms
when
he
knew
that
florine
was
to
occupy
them
matifat
a
tradesman
to
the
backbone
went
about
carefully
afraid
to
touch
the
new
furniture
he
seemed
to
have
the
totals
of
the
bills
always
before
his
eyes
and
to
look
upon
the
splendors
about
him
as
so
much
jewelry
imprudently
withdrawn
from
the
case
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
do
as
much
for
florentine
old
cardot
s
eyes
seemed
to
say
lucien
at
once
began
to
understand
lousteau
s
indifference
to
the
state
of
his
garret
etienne
was
the
real
king
of
these
festivals
etienne
enjoyed
the
use
of
all
these
fine
things
he
was
standing
just
now
on
the
hearthrug
with
his
back
to
the
fire
as
if
he
were
the
master
of
the
house
chatting
with
the

was
congratulating

will
knock

while
florine

coralie
are

and
matifat
disappeared
in
search
of
quills
penknives
and
everything
necessary
suddenly
the
door
was
flung
open
and
tullia
one
of
the
prettiest
of
the
day
dashed
into
the
room
they
agree
to
take
the

addressing

of

all
over

lousteau
very
well
nathan
vernou

du

end
and
blondet
good

vouchsafe
a

of
short
columns
for

i
will
run
round
to
the

it
is

blondet
is

exclaimed
matifat

said
a

in

and
florentine
appeared
i

come
to
look
after

she
added
speaking
with

besides

returned
blondet
taking
up
an

look
here
all
of
you
you
must
use
all
your
wit
before
those
bottles
of
wine
drive
it
out
and
of
all
things
stir
up
du
bruel
he
is
a
vaudevillist
he
is
capable
of
making
bad
jokes
if
you
get
him
to
concert
and
lucien
wrote
his
first
newspaper
article
at
the
round
table
in
florine
s
boudoir
by
the
light
of
the
pink
candles
lighted
by
matifat
before
such
a
remarkable
audience
he
was
eager
to
show
what
he
could
do
the
first
performance
of
the
in
a
an
imbroglio
in
three
first
appearance
of
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
vignol
people
are
coming
and
going
walking
and
talking
everybody
is
looking
for
something
nobody
finds
anything
general
hubbub
the
alcalde
has
lost
his
daughter
and
found
his
cap
but
the
cap
does
not
fit
it
must
belong
to
some
thief
where
is
the
thief
people
walk
and
talk
and
come
and
go
more
than
ever
finally
the
alcalde
finds
a
man
without
his
daughter
and
his
daughter
without
the
man
which
is
satisfactory
for
the
magistrate
but
not
for
the
audience
quiet
being
resorted
the
alcalde
tries
to
examine
the
man
behold
a
venerable
alcalde
sitting
in
an
alcalde
s
great
armchair
arranging
the
sleeves
of
his
alcalde
s
gown
only
in
spain
do
alcaldes
cling
to
their
enormous
sleeves
and
wear
plaited
lawn
ruffles
about
the
magisterial
throat
a
good
half
of
an
alcalde
s
business
on
the
stage
in
paris
this
particular
alcalde
wheezing
and
waddling
about
like
an
asthmatic
old
man
is
vignol
on
whom
potier
s
mantle
has
fallen
a
young
actor
who
personates
old
age
so
admirably
that
the
oldest
men
in
the
audience
can
not
help
laughing
with
that
quavering
voice
of
his
that
bald
forehead
and
those
spindle
shanks
trembling
under
the
weight
of
a
senile
frame
he
may
look
forward
to
a
long
career
of
decrepitude
there
is
something
alarming
about
the
young
actor
s
old
age
he
is
so
very
old
you
feel
nervous
lest
senility
should
be
infectious
and
what
an
admirable
alcalde
he
makes
what
a
delightful
uneasy
smile
what
pompous
stupidity
what
wooden
dignity
what
judicial
hesitation
how
well
the
man
knows
that
black
may
be
white
or
white
black
how
eminently
well
he
is
fitted
to
be
minister
to
a
constitutional
monarch
the
stranger
answers
every
one
of
his
inquiries
by
a
question
vignol
retorts
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
person
under
examination
elicits
all
the
truth
from
the
alcalde
this
piece
of
pure
comedy
with
a
breath
of
moliere
throughout
puts
the
house
in
good
humor
the
people
on
the
stage
all
seemed
to
understand
what
they
were
about
but
i
am
quite
unable
to
clear
up
the
mystery
or
to
say
wherein
it
lay
for
the
alcalde
s
daughter
was
there
personified
by
a
living
breathing
andalusian
a
spaniard
with
a
spaniard
s
eyes
a
spaniard
s
complexion
a
spaniard
s
gait
and
figure
a
spaniard
from
top
to
toe
with
her
poniard
in
her
garter
love
in
her
heart
and
a
cross
on
the
ribbon
about
her
neck
when
the
act
was
over
and
somebody
asked
me
how
the
piece
was
going
i
answered
she
wears
scarlet
stockings
with
green
clocks
to
them
she
has
a
little
foot
no
larger
than
in
her
patent
leather
shoes
and
the
prettiest
pair
of
ankles
in
andalusia
oh
that
alcalde
s
daughter
brings
your
heart
into
your
mouth
she
tantalizes
you
so
horribly
that
you
long
to
spring
upon
the
stage
and
offer
her
your
thatched
hovel
and
your
heart
or
thirty
thousand
livres
per
annum
and
your
pen
the
andalusian
is
the
loveliest
actress
in
paris
coralie
for
she
must
be
called
by
her
real
name
can
be
a
countess
or
a
and
in
which
part
she
would
be
more
charming
one
can
not
tell
she
can
be
anything
that
she
chooses
she
is
born
to
achieve
all
possibilities
can
more
be
said
of
a
boulevard
actress
with
the
second
act
a
parisian
spaniard
appeared
upon
the
scene
with
her
features
cut
like
a
cameo
and
her
dangerous
eyes
where
does
she
come
from
i
asked
in
my
turn
and
was
told
that
she
came
from
the
greenroom
and
that
she
was
mademoiselle
florine
but
upon
my
word
i
could
not
believe
a
syllable
of
it
such
spirit
was
there
in
her
gestures
such
frenzy
in
her
love
she
is
the
rival
of
the
alcalde
s
daughter
and
married
to
a
grandee
cut
out
to
wear
an
almaviva
s
cloak
with
stuff
sufficient
in
it
for
a
hundred
boulevard
noblemen
mlle
florine
wore
neither
scarlet
stockings
with
green
clocks
nor
patent
leather
shoes
but
she
appeared
in
a
mantilla
a
veil
which
she
put
to
admirable
uses
like
the
great
lady
that
she
is
she
showed
to
admiration
that
the
tigress
can
be
a
cat
i
began
to
understand
from
the
sparkling
talk
between
the
two
that
some
drama
of
jealousy
was
going
on
and
just
as
everything
was
put
right
the
alcalde
s
stupidity
embroiled
everybody
again
torchbearers
rich
men
footmen
figaros
grandees
alcaldes
dames
and
damsels
the
whole
company
on
the
stage
began
to
eddy
about
and
come
and
go
and
look
for
one
another
the
plot
thickened
again
i
left
it
to
thicken
for
florine
the
jealous
and
the
happy
coralie
had
entangled
me
once
more
in
the
folds
of
mantilla
and
basquina
and
their
little
feet
were
twinkling
in
my
eyes
i
managed
however
to
reach
the
third
act
without
any
mishap
the
commissary
of
police
was
not
compelled
to
interfere
and
i
did
nothing
to
scandalize
the
house
wherefore
i
begin
to
believe
in
the
influence
of
that
public
and
religious
morality
about
which
the
chamber
of
deputies
is
so
anxious
that
any
one
might
think
there
was
no
morality
left
in
france
i
even
contrived
to
gather
that
a
man
was
in
love
with
two
women
who
failed
to
return
his
affection
or
else
that
two
women
were
in
love
with
a
man
who
loved
neither
of
them
the
man
did
not
love
the
alcalde
or
the
alcalde
had
no
love
for
the
man
who
was
nevertheless
a
gallant
gentleman
and
in
love
with
somebody
with
himself
perhaps
or
with
heaven
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
for
he
becomes
a
monk
and
if
you
want
to
know
any
more
you
can
go
to
the
you
are
hereby
given
fair
warning
you
must
go
once
to
accustom
yourself
to
those
irresistible
scarlet
stockings
with
the
green
clocks
to
little
feet
full
of
promises
to
eyes
with
a
ray
of
sunlight
shining
through
them
to
the
subtle
charm
of
a
parisienne
disguised
as
an
andalusian
girl
and
of
an
andalusian
masquerading
as
a
parisienne
you
must
go
a
second
time
to
enjoy
the
play
to
shed
tears
over
the
grandee
and
die
of
laughing
at
the
old
alcalde
the
play
is
twice
a
success
the
author
who
writes
it
it
is
said
in
collaboration
with
one
of
the
great
poets
of
the
day
was
called
before
the
curtain
and
appeared
with
a
damsel
on
each
arm
and
fairly
brought
down
the
excited
house
the
two
dancers
seemed
to
have
more
wit
in
their
legs
than
the
author
himself
but
when
once
the
fair
rivals
left
the
stage
the
dialogue
seemed
witty
at
once
a
triumphant
proof
of
the
excellence
of
the
piece
the
applause
and
calls
for
the
author
caused
the
architect
some
anxiety
but
de
cursy
the
author
being
accustomed
to
volcanic
eruptions
of
the
reeling
vesuvius
beneath
the
chandelier
felt
no
tremor
as
for
the
actresses
they
danced
the
famous
bolero
of
seville
which
once
found
favor
in
the
sight
of
a
council
of
reverend
fathers
and
escaped
ecclesiastical
censure
in
spite
of
its
wanton
dangerous
grace
the
bolero
in
itself
would
be
enough
to
attract
old
age
while
there
is
any
lingering
heat
of
youth
in
the
veins
and
out
of
charity
i
warn
these
persons
to
keep
the
lenses
of
their
well
polished
while
lucien
was
writing
a
column
which
was
to
set
a
new
fashion
in
journalism
and
reveal
a
fresh
and
original
gift
lousteau
indited
an
article
of
the
kind
described
as
a
sketch
of
contemporary
manners
entitled
elderly
the
buck
of
the
empire
he
wrote
is
invariably
long
slender
and
well
preserved
he
wears
a
corset
and
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
his
name
was
originally
potelet
or
something
very
like
it
but
to
stand
well
with
the
court
he
conferred
a
upon
himself
and
potelet
he
is
until
another
revolution
a
baron
of
the
empire
a
man
of
two
ends
as
his
name
a
post
implies
he
is
paying
his
court
to
the
faubourg
after
a
youth
gloriously
and
usefully
spent
as
the
agreeable
trainbearer
of
a
sister
of
the
man
whom
decency
forbids
me
to
mention
by
name
du
potelet
has
forgotten
that
he
was
once
in
waiting
upon
her
imperial
highness
but
he
still
sings
the
songs
composed
for
the
benefactress
who
took
such
a
tender
interest
in
his
career
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
it
was
a
tissue
of
personalities
silly
enough
for
the
most
part
such
as
they
used
to
write
in
those
days
other
papers
and
notably
the
have
brought
the
art
to
a
curious
perfection
since
lousteau
compared
the
baron
to
a
heron
and
introduced
mme
de
bargeton
to
whom
he
was
paying
his
court
as
a
cuttlefish
bone
a
burlesque
absurdity
which
amused
readers
who
knew
neither
of
the
personages
a
tale
of
the
loves
of
the
heron
who
tried
in
vain
to
swallow
the
cuttlefish
bone
which
broke
into
three
pieces
when
he
dropped
it
was
irresistibly
ludicrous
everybody
remembers
the
sensation
which
the
pleasantry
made
in
the
faubourg
it
was
the
first
of
a
series
of
similar
articles
and
was
one
of
the
thousand
and
one
causes
which
provoked
the
rigorous
press
legislation
of
charles
x
an
hour
later
blondet
lousteau
and
lucien
came
back
to
the
where
the

the

there
and
the

women
the

merchants
the

and
finot
a

with
a

cap
on

then
for

sir
they

take

and
to
the
that
boy

is
appalling
to
me
remarked
finot
and
the
minister
was
in
the
middle
of
a
prediction
of
a
brilliant
future
for
the
urchin
when
the
three
came
in
blondet
read
aloud
an
extremely
clever
article
against
the
romantics
lousteau
s
paragraph
drew
laughter
and
by
the
duc
de
rhetore
s
advice
an
indirect
eulogium
of
mme
d
espard
was
slipped
in
lest
the
whole
faubourg
should
take
offence
what
have
written
asked
finot
turning
to
lucien
and
lucien
read
quaking
for
fear
but
the
room
rang
with
applause
when
he
finished
the
actresses
embraced
the
neophyte
and
the
two
merchants
following
suit
half
choked
the
breath
out
of
him
there
were
tears
in
du
bruel
s
eyes
as
he
grasped
his
critic
s
hand
and
the
manager
invited
him
to
dinner
there
are
no
children
nowadays
said
blondet
since
de
chateaubriand
called
victor
hugo
a
sublime
child
i
can
only
tell
you
quite
simply
that
you
have
spirit
and
taste
and
write
like
a
he
is
on
the
newspaper
said
finot
as
he
thanked
etienne
and
gave
him
a
shrewd
glance
what
jokes
have
you
made
inquired
lousteau
turning
to

now
that

perhaps

alone
le
vicomte
demosthenes
was
heard
to
say
yesterday
an
ultra
condemning
pasquier
s
speech
said
his
programme
was
only
a
continuation
of
decaze
s
policy
yes
said
a
lady
but
he
stands
on
a
monarchical
basis
he
has
just
the
kind
of
leg
for
a
court
with
such
a
beginning
i
don
t
ask
more
of
you
said
finot
it
will
be
all
run
round
with
this
he
added
turning
to
the
boy
the
paper
is
not
exactly
a
genuine
article
but
it
is
our
best
number
yet
and
he
turned
to
the
group
of
writers
already
lucien
s
colleagues
were
privately
taking
his
measure
that
fellow
has
brains
said
blondet
his
article
is
well
written
said

supper
cried
matifat
the

gave
his
arm
to

coralie
went
across
to
lucien
and
tullia
went
in
to
supper
between
emile
blondet
and
the
german
minister
i
can
not
understand
why
you
are
making
an
onslaught
on
mme
de
bargeton
and
the
baron
du
chatelet
they
say
that
he
is
of
the
charente
and
will
be
master
of
requests
some
mme
de
bargeton
showed
lucien
the
door
as
if
he
had
been
an
imposter
said
lousteau
such
a
fine
young
fellow
exclaimed
the
minister
supper
served
with
new
plate
sevres
porcelain
and
white
damask
was
redolent
of
opulence
the
dishes
were
from
chevet
the
wines
from
a
celebrated
merchant
on
the
quai
a
personal
friend
of
matifat
s
for
the
first
time
lucien
beheld
the
luxury
of
paris
displayed
he
went
from
surprise
to
surprise
but
he
kept
his
astonishment
to
himself
like
a
man
who
had
spirit
and
taste
and
wrote
like
a
gentleman
as
blondet
had
said
as
they
crossed
the
coralie
bent
to
florine
make
camusot
so
drunk
that
he
will
be
compelled
to
stop
here
all
night
she
whispered
so
you
have
hooked
your
journalist
have
you
returned
florine
using
the
idiom
of
women
of
her
class
no
dear
i
love
him
said
coralie
with
an
adorable
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
those
words
rang
in
lucien
s
ears
borne
to
them
by
the
fifth
deadly
sin
coralie
was
perfectly
dressed
every
woman
possesses
some
personal
charm
in
perfection
and
coralie
s
toilette
brought
her
characteristic
beauty
into
prominence
her
dress
moreover
like
florine
s
was
of
some
exquisite
stuff
unknown
as
yet
to
the
public
a
de
with
which
camusot
had
been
supplied
a
few
days
before
the
rest
of
the
world
for
as
owner
of
the
he
was
a
kind
of
providence
in
paris
to
the
lyons
silkweavers
love
and
toilet
are
like
color
and
perfume
for
a
woman
and
coralie
in
her
happiness
looked
lovelier
than
ever
a
delight
which
can
not
elude
the
grasp
possesses
an
immense
charm
for
youth
perhaps
in
their
eyes
the
secret
of
the
attraction
of
a
house
of
pleasure
lies
in
the
certainty
of
gratification
perhaps
many
a
long
fidelity
is
attributable
to
the
same
cause
love
for
love
s
sake
first
love
indeed
had
blent
with
one
of
the
strange
violent
fancies
which
sometimes
possess
these
poor
creatures
and
love
and
admiration
of
lucien
s
great
beauty
taught
coralie
to
express
the
thoughts
in
her
heart
i
should
love
you
if
you
were
ill
and
ugly
she
whispered
as
they
sat
down
what
a
saying
for
a
poet
camusot
utterly
vanished
lucien
had
forgotten
his
existence
he
saw
coralie
and
had
eyes
for
nothing
else
how
should
he
draw
back
this
creature
all
sensation
all
enjoyment
of
life
tired
of
the
monotony
of
existence
in
a
country
town
weary
of
poverty
harassed
by
enforced
continence
impatient
of
the
claustral
life
of
the
rue
de
cluny
of
toiling
without
reward
the
fascination
of
the
under
world
of
paris
was
upon
him
how
should
he
rise
and
leave
this
brilliant
gathering
lucien
stood
with
one
foot
in
coralie
s
chamber
and
the
other
in
the
quicksands
of
journalism
after
so
much
vain
search
and
climbing
of
so
many
stairs
after
standing
about
and
waiting
in
the
rue
de
sentier
he
had
found
journalism
a
jolly
boon
companion
joyous
over
the
wine
his
wrongs
had
just
been
avenged
there
were
two
for
whom
he
had
vainly
striven
to
fill
the
cup
of
humiliation
and
pain
which
he
had
been
made
to
drink
to
the
dregs
and
now
they
should
receive
a
stab
in
their
very
hearts
here
is
a
real
friend
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
lousteau
it
never
crossed
his
mind
that
lousteau
already
regarded
him
as
a
dangerous
rival
he
had
made
a
blunder
he
had
done
his
very
best
when
a
colorless
article
would
have
served
him
admirably
well
blondet
s
remark
to
finot
that
it
would
be
better
to
come
to
terms
with
a
man
of
that
calibre
had
counteracted
lousteau
s
gnawing
jealousy
he
reflected
that
it
would
be
prudent
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
lucien
and
at
the
same
time
to
arrange
with
finot
to
exploit
this
formidable
newcomer
he
must
be
kept
in
poverty
the
decision
was
made
in
a
moment
and
the
bargain
made
in
a
few
whispered
words
he
has
he
will
want
the
ah
good
a
supper
among
french
journalists
always
fills
me
with
dread
said
the
german
diplomatist
with
serene
urbanity
he
looked
as
he
spoke
at
blondet
whom
he
had
met
at
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
s
it
is
laid
upon
you
gentlemen
to
fulfil
a
prophecy
of
blucher
what
prophecy
asked
nathan
when
blucher
and
sacken
arrived
on
the
heights
of
montmartre
in
pardon
me
gentlemen
for
recalling
a
day
unfortunate
for
france
sacken
a
rough
brute
remarked
now
we
will
set
paris
alight
take
very
good
care
that
you
don
t
said
blucher
france
will
die
of
nothing
else
can
kill
her
and
he
waved
his
hand
over
the
glowing
seething
city
that
lay
like
a
huge
canker
in
the
valley
of
the
there
are
no
journalists
in
our
country
thank
heaven
continued
the
minister
after
a
pause
i
have
not
yet
recovered
from
the
fright
that
the
little
fellow
gave
me
a
boy
of
ten
in
a
paper
cap
with
the
sense
of
an
old
diplomatist
and
i
feel
as
if
i
were
supping
with
lions
and
panthers
who
graciously
sheathe
their
claws
in
my
it
is
clear
said
blondet
that
we
are
at
liberty
to
inform
europe
that
a
serpent
dropped
from
your
excellency
s
lips
this
evening
and
that
the
venomous
creature
failed
to
inoculate
mlle
tullia
the
prettiest
dancer
in
paris
and
to
follow
up
the
story
with
a
commentary
on
eve
and
the
scriptures
and
the
first
and
last
transgression
but
have
no
fear
you
are
our
it
would
be
funny
said
finot
we
would
begin
with
a
scientific
treatise
on
all
the
serpents
found
in
the
human
heart
and
human
body
and
so
proceed
to
the
said
lousteau
and
we
could
exhibit
one
in
spirits
in
a
bottle
of
brandied
cherries
said
vernou
till
you
yourself
would
end
by
believing
in
the
story
added
vignon
looking
at
the
diplomatist
gentlemen
cried
the
duc
de
rhetore
let
sleeping
claws
the
influence
and
power
of
the
press
is
only
dawning
said
finot
journalism
is
in
its
infancy
it
will
grow
in
ten
years
time
everything
will
be
brought
into
publicity
the
light
of
thought
will
be
turned
on
all
subjects
and
the
blight
of
thought
will
be
over
it
all
corrected
blondet
here
is
an
apothegm
cried
claude
vignon
thought
will
make
kings
said
lousteau
and
undo
monarchs
said
the
german
and
therefore
said
blondet
if
the
press
did
not
exist
it
would
be
necessary
to
invent
it
forthwith
but
here
we
have
it
and
live
by
you
will
die
of
it
returned
the
german
diplomatist
can
you
not
see
that
if
you
enlighten
the
masses
and
raise
them
in
the
political
scale
you
make
it
all
the
harder
for
the
individual
to
rise
above
their
level
can
you
not
see
that
if
you
sow
the
seeds
of
reasoning
among
the
you
will
reap
revolt
and
be
the
first
to
fall
victims
what
do
they
smash
in
paris
when
a
riot
begins
the
said
nathan
but
we
are
too
modest
to
fear
for
ourselves
we
only
run
the
risk
of
as
a
nation
you
have
too
much
mental
activity
to
allow
any
government
to
run
its
course
without
interference
but
for
that
you
would
make
the
conquest
of
europe
a
second
time
and
win
with
the
pen
all
that
you
failed
to
keep
with
the
journalism
is
an
evil
said
claude
vignon
the
evil
may
have
its
uses
but
the
present
government
is
resolved
to
put
it
down
there
will
be
a
battle
over
it
who
will
give
way
that
is
the
the
government
will
give
way
said
blondet
i
keep
telling
people
that
with
all
my
might
intellectual
power
is
great
power
in
france
and
the
press
has
more
wit
than
all

of

reason
to
be

laugh
at
the
whole

is
right
said
claude
vignon
journalism
so
far
from
being
in
the
hands
of
a
priesthood
came
to
be
first
a
party
weapon
and
then
a
commercial
speculation
carried
on
without
conscience
or
scruple
like
other
commercial
speculations
every
newspaper
as
blondet
says
is
a
shop
to
which
people
come
for
opinions
of
the
right
shade
if
there
were
a
paper
for
hunchbacks
it
would
set
forth
plainly
morning
and
evening
in
its
columns
the
beauty
the
utility
and
necessity
of
deformity
a
newspaper
is
not
supposed
to
enlighten
its
readers
but
to
supply
them
with
congenial
opinions
give
any
newspaper
time
enough
and
it
will
be
base
hypocritical
shameless
and
treacherous
the
periodical
press
will
be
the
death
of
ideas
systems
and
individuals
nay
it
will
flourish
upon
their
decay
it
will
take
the
credit
of
all
creations
of
the

the
harm
that
it
does
is
done
anonymously
we
for

aphorism

by
his
study
of

sums
up
the
whole
significance
of
a

whichever
you

however
shamefully

invents
a
scandalous

off
with
an
apology

taking
so
great
a

the
mistake
but
ask
for
redress

laugh
in
your
face

treat
his
offence
as
a
mere
trifle
the
paper
scoffs
if
the
victim
gains

played
off

opposition
papers
would
batter
down
a
government
of
their

up

they
are
battering
the
present
government
if
any
demand
was
refused
the
more
they
have
the
more
they
will
want
in
the
way
of

the
journalist
will
be
succeeded
by
the
starveling
hack
there
is
no
salve
for
this
sore
it
is
a
kind
of
corruption
which
grows
more
and
more
obtrusive
and
malignant
the
wider
it
spreads
the
more
patiently
it
will
be
endured
until
the
day
comes
when
newspapers
shall
so
increase
and
multiply
in
the
earth
that
confusion
will
be
the
result
a
second
babel
we
all
of
us
such
as
we
are
have
reason
to
know
that
crowned
kings
are
less
ungrateful
than
kings
of
our
profession
that
the
most
sordid
man
of
business
is
not
so
mercenary
nor
so
keen
in
speculation
that
our
brains
are
consumed
to
furnish
their
daily
supply
of
poisonous
trash
and
yet
we
all
of
us
shall
continue
to
write
like
men
who
work
in
quicksilver
mines
knowing
that
they
are
doomed
to
die
of
their
trade
look
there
he
continued
at
that
young
man
sitting
beside
coralie
what
is
his
name
lucien
he
has
a
beautiful
face
he
is
a
poet
and
what
is
more
he
is
witty
so
much
the
better
for
him
well
he
will
cross
the
threshold
of
one
of
those
dens
where
a
man
s
intellect
is
prostituted
he
will
put
all
his
best
and
finest
thought
into
his
work
he
will
blunt
his
intellect
and
sully
his
soul
he
will
be
guilty
of
anonymous
meannesses
which
take
the
place
of
stratagem
pillage
and
ratting
to
the
enemy
in
the
warfare
of
and
when
like
hundreds
more
he
has
squandered
his
genius
in
the
service
of
others
who
find
the
capital
and
do
no
work
those
dealers
in
poisons
will
leave
him
to
starve
if
he
is
thirsty
and
to
die
of
thirst
if
he
is
thanks
said
finot
but
dear
me
continued
claude
vignon
knew
all
this
yet
here
am
i
in
the
galleys
and
the
arrival
of
another
convict
gives
me
pleasure
we
are
cleverer
blondet
and
i
than
messieurs
this
and
that
who
speculate
in
our
abilities
yet
nevertheless
we
are
always
exploited
by
them
we
have
a
heart
somewhere
beneath
the
intellect
we
have
not
the
grim
qualities
of
the
man
who
makes
others
work
for
him
we
are
indolent
we
like
to
look
on
at
the
game
we
are
meditative
and
we
are
fastidious
they
will
sweat
our
brains
and
blame
us
for
i
thought
you
would
be
more
amusing
than
this
said
florine
florine
is
right
said
blondet
let
us
leave
the
cure
of
public
evils
to
those
quacks
the
statesmen
as
charlet
says
quarrel
with
my
own
bread
and
butter
do
you
know
what
vignon
puts
me
in
mind
of
said
lousteau
of
one
of
those
fat
women
in
the
rue
du
pelican
telling
a
schoolboy
my
boy
you
are
too
young
to
come
a
burst
of
laughter
followed
the
sally
but
it
pleased
coralie
the
merchants
meanwhile
ate
and
drank
and
listened
what
a
nation
this
is
you
see
so
much
good
in
it
and
so
much
evil
said
the
minister
addressing
the
duc
de
you
are
prodigals
who
can
not
ruin
yourselves
and
so
by
the
blessing
of
chance
lucien
standing
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
over
which
he
was
destined
to
fall
heard
warnings
on
all
sides
d
arthez
had
set
him
on
the
right
road
had
shown
him
the
noble
method
of
work
and
aroused
in
him
the
spirit
before
which
all
obstacles
disappear
lousteau
himself
partly
from
selfish
motives
had
tried
to
warn
him
away
by
describing
journalism
and
literature
in
their
practical
aspects
lucien
had
refused
to
believe
that
there
could
be
so
much
hidden
corruption
but
now
he
had
heard
the
journalists
themselves
crying
woe
for
their
hurt
he
had
seen
them
at
their
work
had
watched
them
tearing
their
s
heart
to
read
auguries
of
the
future
that
evening
he
had
seen
things
as
they
are
he
beheld
the
very
heart
s
core
of
corruption
of
that
paris
which
blucher
so
aptly
described
and
so
far
from
shuddering
at
the
sight
he
was
intoxicated
with
enjoyment
of
the
intellectually
stimulating
society
in
which
he
found
himself
these
extraordinary
men
clad
in
armor
damascened
by
their
vices
these
intellects
environed
by
cold
and
brilliant
analysis
seemed
so
far
greater
in
his
eyes
than
the
grave
and
earnest
members
of
the
brotherhood
and
besides
all
this
he
was
reveling
in
his
first
taste
of
luxury
he
had
fallen
under
the
spell
his
capricious
instincts
awoke
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
drank
exquisite
wines
this
was
his
first
experience
of
cookery
carried
to
the
pitch
of
a
fine
art
a
minister
a
duke
and
an
had
joined
the
party
of
journalists
and
wondered
at
their
sinister
power
lucien
felt
a
horrible
craving
to
reign
over
these
kings
and
he
thought
that
he
had
power
to
win
his
kingdom
finally
there
was
this
coralie
made
happy
by
a
few
words
of
his
by
the
bright
light
of
the
through
the
steam
of
the
dishes
and
the
fumes
of
wine
she
looked
sublimely
beautiful
to
his
eyes
so
fair
had
she
grown
with
love
she
was
the
loveliest
the
most
beautiful
actress
in
paris
the
brotherhood
the
heaven
of
noble
thoughts
faded
away
before
a
temptation
that
appealed
to
every
fibre
of
his
nature
how
could
it
have
been
otherwise
lucien
s
author
s
vanity
had
just
been
gratified
by
the
praises
of
those
who
know
by
the
appreciation
of
his
future
rivals
the
success
of
his
articles
and
his
conquest
of
coralie
might
have
turned
an
older
head
than
his
during
the
discussion
moreover
every
one
at
table
had
made
a
remarkably
good
supper
and
such
wines
are
not
met
with
every
day
lousteau
sitting
beside
camusot
furtively
poured
several
times
into
his
neighbor
s
wineglass
and
challenged
him
to
drink
and
camusot
drank
all
unsuspicious
for
he
thought
himself
in
his
own
way
a
match
for
a
journalist
the
jokes
became
more
personal
when
dessert
appeared
and
the
wine
began
to
circulate
the
german
minister
a
man
of
the
world
made
a
sign
to
the
duke
and
tullia
and
the
three
disappeared
with
the
first
symptoms
of
vociferous
nonsense
which
precede
the
grotesque
scenes
of
an
orgy
in
its
final
stage
coralie
and
lucien
had
been
behaving
like
children
all
the
evening
as
soon
as
the
wine
was
uppermost
in
camusot
s
head
they
made
good
their
escape
down
the
staircase
and
sprang
into
a
cab
camusot
subsided
under
the
table
matifat
looking
round
for
him
thought
that
he
had
gone
home
with
coralie
left
his
guests
to
smoke
laugh
and
argue
and
followed
florine
to
her
room
daylight
surprised
the
party
or
more
accurately
the
first
dawn
of
light
discovered
one
man
still
able
to
speak
and
blondet
that
intrepid
champion
was
proposing
to
the
assembled
sleepers
a
health
to
aurora
the
lucien
was
unaccustomed
to
orgies
of
this
kind
his
head
was
very
tolerably
clear
as
he
came
down
the
staircase
but
the
fresh
air
was
too
much
for
him
he
was
horribly
drunk
when
they
reached
the
handsome
house
in
the
rue
de
vendome
where
the
actress
lived
coralie
and
her
were
obliged
to
assist
the
poet
to
climb
to
the
first
floor
lucien
was
ignominiously
sick
and
very
nearly
fainted
on
the
staircase
quick
berenice
some
tea
make
some
tea
cried
coralie
it
is
nothing
it
is
the
air
lucien
got
out
and
i
have
never
taken
so
much
before
in
my
poor
boy
he
is
as
innocent
as
a
lamb
said
berenice
a
stalwart
norman
peasant
woman
as
ugly
as
coralie
was
pretty
lucien
half
unconscious
was
laid
at
last
in
bed
coralie
with
berenice
s
assistance
undressed
the
poet
with
all
a
mother
s
tender
care
it
is
nothing
he
murmured
again
and
again
it
is
the
air
thank
you
how
charmingly
he
says
mamma
cried
coralie
putting
a
kiss
on
his
hair
what
happiness
to
love
such
an
angel
mademoiselle
where
did
you
pick
him
up
i
did
not
think
a
man
could
be
as
beautiful
as
you
are
said
berenice
when
lucien
lay
in
bed
he
was
very
drowsy
he
knew
nothing
and
saw
nothing
coralie
made
him
swallow
several
cups
of
tea
and
left
him
to
sleep
did
the
porter
see
us
was
there
anyone
else
about
she
asked
no
i
was
sitting
up
for
does
victoire
know
anything
rather
not
returned
berenice
ten
hours
later
lucien
awoke
to
meet
coralie
s
eyes
she
had
watched
by
him
as
he
slept
he
knew
it
poet
that
he
was
it
was
almost
noon
but
she
still
wore
the
delicate
dress
abominably
stained
which
she
meant
to
lay
up
as
a
relic
lucien
understood
all
the
and
delicacy
of
love
fain
of
its
reward
he
looked
into
coralie
s
eyes
in
a
moment
she
had
flung
off
her
clothing
and
slipped
like
a
serpent
to
lucien
s
side
at
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
lucien
was
still
sleeping
cradled
in
this
voluptuous
paradise
he
had
caught
glimpses
of
coralie
s
chamber
an
exquisite
creation
of
luxury
a
world
of
and
white
he
had
admired
florine
s
apartments
but
this
surpassed
them
in
its
dainty
refinement
coralie
had
already
risen
for
if
she
was
to
play
her
part
as
the
andalusian
she
must
be
at
the
theatre
by
seven
o
clock
yet
she
had
returned
to
gaze
at
the
unconscious
poet
lulled
to
sleep
in
bliss
she
could
not
drink
too
deeply
of
this
love
that
rose
to
rapture
drawing
close
the
bond
between
the
heart
and
the
senses
to
steep
both
in
ecstasy
for
in
that
apotheosis
of
human
passion
which
of
those
that
were
twain
on
earth
that
they
might
know
bliss
to
the
full
creates
one
soul
to
rise
to
love
in
heaven
lay
coralie
s
justification
who
moreover
would
not
have
found
excuse
in
lucien
s
more
than
human
beauty
to
the
actress
kneeling
by
the
bedside
happy
in
love
within
her
it
seemed
that
she
had
received
love
s
consecration
berenice
broke
in
upon
coralie
s
rapture
here
comes
camusot
cried
the
maid
and
he
knows
that
you
are
lucien
sprang
up
at
once
innate
generosity
suggested
that
he
was
doing
coralie
an
injury
berenice
drew
aside
a
curtain
and
he
fled
into
a
dainty
whither
coralie
and
the
maid
brought
his
clothes
with
magical
speed
camusot
appeared
and
only
then
did
coralie
s
eyes
alight
on
lucien
s
boots
warming
in
the
fender
berenice
had
privately
varnished
them
and
put
them
before
the
fire
to
dry
and
both
mistress
and
maid
alike
forgot
that
witness
berenice
left
the
room
with
a
scared
glance
at
coralie
coralie
flung
herself
into
the
depths
of
a
settee
and
bade
camusot
seat
himself
in
the
a
chair
that
stood
opposite
but
coralie
s
adorer
honest
soul
dared
not
look
his
mistress
in
the
face
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
pair
of
boots
ought
i
to
make
a
scene
and
leave
coralie
he
pondered
is
it
worth
while
to
make
a
fuss
about
a
trifle
there
is
a
pair
of
boots
wherever
you
go
these
would
be
more
in
place
in
a
shop
window
or
taking
a
walk
on
the
boulevard
on
somebody
s
feet
here
however
without
a
pair
of
feet
in
them
they
tell
a
pretty
plain
tale
i
am
fifty
years
old
and
that
is
the
truth
i
ought
to
be
as
blind
as
cupid
there
was
no
excuse
for
this
monologue
the
boots
were
not
the
at
present
in
vogue
which
an
unobservant
man
may
be
allowed
to
disregard
up
to
a
certain
point
they
were
the
unmistakable
uncompromising
hessians
then
prescribed
by
fashion
a
pair
of
extremely
elegant
betasseled
boots
which
shone
in
glistening
contrast
against
trousers
invariably
of
some
light
color
and
reflected
their
surroundings
like
a
mirror
the
boots
stared
the
honest
out
of
countenance
and
it
must
be
added
they
pained
his
heart
what
is
it
asked
coralie
ring
the
bell
said
coralie
smiling
to
herself
at
camusot
s
want
of
berenice
she
said
when
the
norman
handmaid
appeared
just
bring
me
a
for
i
must
put
on
these
confounded
boots
again
don
t
forget
to
bring
them
to
my
what
boots
faltered
out
camusot
breathing
more
freely
and
whose
should
they
be
she
demanded
haughtily
were
you
beginning
to
believe
great
stupid
oh
and
he
would
believe
it
too
she
went
on
addressing
i
have
a
man
s
part
in
what
s
piece
and
i
have
never
worn
a
man
s
clothes
in
my
life
before
the
bootmaker
for
the
theatre
brought
me
these
things
to
try
if
i
could
walk
in
them
until
a
pair
can
be
made
to
measure
he
put
them
on
but
they
hurt
me
so
much
that
i
have
taken
them
off
and
after
all
i
must
wear
don
t
put
them
on
again
if
they
are
uncomfortable
said
camusot
the
boots
had
made
him
feel
so
very
uncomfortable
himself
mademoiselle
would
do
better
to
have
a
pair
made
of
very
thin
morocco
sir
instead
of
torturing
herself
as
she
did
just
now
but
the
management
is
so
stingy
she
was
crying
sir
if
i
was
a
man
and
loved
a
woman
i
wouldn
t
let
her
shed
a
tear
i
know
you
ought
to
order
a
pair
for
her
yes
yes
said
camusot
are
you
just
getting
up
coralie
just
this
moment
i
only
came
in
at
six
o
clock
after
looking
for
you
everywhere
i
was
obliged
to
keep
the
cab
for
seven
hours
so
much
for
your
care
of
me
you
forget
me
for
a
i
ought
to
take
care
of
myself
now
when
i
am
to
play
every
night
so
long
as
the
draws
i
don
t
want
to
fall
off
after
that
young
man
s
notice
of
that
is
a
handsome
boy
said
camusot
do
you
think
so
i
don
t
admire
men
of
that
sort
they
are
too
much
like
women
and
they
do
not
understand
how
to
love
like
you
stupid
old
business
men
you
are
so
bored
with
your
own
is
monsieur
dining
with
madame
inquired
berenice
no
my
mouth
is
you
were
nicely
screwed
yesterday
ah
papa
camusot
i
don
t
like
men
who
drink
i
tell
you
at
once
you
will
give
that
young
man
a
present
i
suppose
interrupted
camusot
oh
yes
i
would
rather
do
that
than
pay
as
florine
does
there
go
away
with
you
that
one
loves
or
give
me
a
carriage
to
save
time
in
you
shall
go
in
your
own
carriage
to
your
manager
s
dinner
at
the
de
the
new
piece

not
be
given
next
come
i
am
just
going
to
dine
said
coralie
hurrying
camusot
out
of
the
room
an
hour
later
berenice
came
to
release
lucien
berenice
coralie
s
companion
since
her
childhood
had
a
keen
and
subtle
brain
in
her
unwieldy
frame
stay
here
she
said
coralie
is
coming
back
alone
she
even
talked
of
getting
rid
of
camusot
if
he
is
in
your
way
but
you
are
too
much
of
an
angel
to
ruin
her
her
heart
s
darling
as
you
are
she
wants
to
clear
out
of
this
she
says
to
leave
this
paradise
and
go
and
live
in
your
garret
oh
there
are
those
that
are
jealous
and
envious
of
you
and
they
have
told
her
that
you
haven
t
a
brass
farthing
and
live
in
the
latin
quarter
and
i
should
go
too
you
see
to
do
the
but
i
have
just
been
comforting
her
poor
child
i
have
been
telling
her
that
you
were
too
clever
to
do
anything
so
silly
i
was
right
wasn
t
i
sir
oh
you
will
see
that
you
are

old
fool

nothing
but

knew
how
nice
she
is
when
i
hear
her
say
her
part
over
my
coralie
my
little
pet
she
is
she
deserved
that
god
in
heaven
should
send
her
one
of
his
angels
she
was
sick
of
the
she
was
so
unhappy
with
her
mother
that
used
to
beat
her
and
sold
her
yes
sir
sold
her
own
child
if
i
had
a
daughter
i
would
wait
on
her
hand
and
foot
as
i
wait
on
coralie
she
is
like
my
own
child
to
these
are
the
first
good
times
she
has
seen
since
i
have
been
with
her
the
first
time
that
she
has
been
really
applauded
you
have
written
something
it
seems
and
they
have
got
up
a
famous
for
the
second
performance
braulard
has
been
going
through
the
play
with
her
while
you
were
who
braulard
asked
lucien
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
heard
the
name
before
he
is
the
head
of
the
and
she
was
arranging
with
him
the
places
where
she
wished
him
to
look
after
her
florine
might
try
to
play
her
some
shabby
trick
and
take
all
for
herself
for
all
she
calls
herself
her
friend
there
is
such
a
talk
about
your
article
on
the
isn
t
it
a
bed
fit
for
a
prince
she
said
smoothing
the
lace
she
lighted
the
and
to
lucien
s
bewildered
fancy
the
house
seemed
to
be
some
palace
in
the
des
camusot
had
chosen
the
richest
stuffs
from
the
for
the
hangings
and
a
carpet
fit
for
a
king
s
palace
was
spread
upon
the
floor
the
carving
of
the
rosewood
furniture
caught
and
imprisoned
the
light
that
rippled
over
its
surface
priceless
trifles
gleamed
from
the
white
marble
the
rug
beside
the
bed
was
of
swan
s
skins
bordered
with
sable
a
pair
of
little
black
velvet
slippers
lined
with
purple
silk
told
of
happiness
awaiting
the
poet
of
a
dainty
lamp
hung
from
the
ceiling
draped
with
silk
the
room
was
full
of
flowering
plants
delicate
white
heaths
and
scentless
camellias
in
stands
marvelously
wrought
everything
called
up
associations
of
innocence
how
was
it
possible
in
these
rooms
to
see
the
life
that
coralie
led
in
its
true
colors
berenice
noticed
lucien
s
bewildered
expression
isn
t
it
nice
she
said
coaxingly
you
would
be
more
comfortable
here
wouldn
t
you
than
in
a
garret
you
won
t
let
her
do
anything
rash
she
continued
setting
a
costly
stand
before
him
covered
with
dishes
abstracted
from
her
mistress
lest
the
cook
should
suspect
that
her
mistress
had
a
lover
in
the
house
lucien
made
a
good
dinner
berenice
waiting
on
him
the
dishes
were
of
wrought
silver
the
painted
porcelain
plates
had
cost
a
louis
d
or
apiece
the
luxury
was
producing
exactly
the
same
effect
upon
him
that
the
sight
of
a
girl
walking
the
pavement
with
her
bare
flaunting
throat
and
neat
ankles
produces
upon
a
schoolboy
how
lucky
camusot
is
cried
he
lucky
repeated
berenice
he
would
willingly
give
all
that
he
is
worth
to
be
in
your
place
he
would
be
glad
to
barter
his
gray
hair
for
your
golden
she
gave
lucien
the
richest
wine
that
bordeaux
keeps
for
the
wealthiest
english
purchaser
and
persuaded
lucien
to
go
to
bed
to
take
a
preliminary
nap
and
lucien
in
truth
was
quite
willing
to
sleep
on
the
couch
that
he
had
been
admiring
berenice
had
read
his
wish
and
felt
glad
for
her
mistress
at
ten
that
night
lucien
awoke
to
look
into
eyes
brimming
over
with
love
there
stood
coralie
in
most
luxurious
night
attire
lucien
had
been
sleeping
lucien
was
intoxicated
with
love
and
not
with
wine
berenice
left
the
room
with
the
inquiry
what
time
morning
at
eleven
o
clock
we
will
have
breakfast
in
bed
i
am
not
at
home
to
anybody
before
two
o
at
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
coralie
and
her
lover
were
sitting
together
the
poet
to
all
appearance
had
come
to
pay
a
call
lucien
had
been
bathed
and
combed
and
dressed
coralie
had
sent
to
colliau
s
for
a
dozen
fine
shirts
a
dozen
cravats
and
a
dozen
for
him
as
well
as
twelve
pairs
of
gloves
in
a
box
when
a
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
they
both
rushed
to
the
window
and
watched
camusot
alight
from
a
handsome
coupe
i
would
not
have
believed
that
one
could
so
hate
a
man
and
luxury
i
am
too
poor
to
allow
you
to
ruin
yourself
for
me
he
replied
and
thus
lucien
passed
under
the
caudine
forks
poor
pet
said
coralie
holding
him
tightly
to
her
do
you
love
me
so
much
i
persuaded
this
gentleman
to
call
on
me
this
morning
she
continued
indicating
lucien
to
camusot
who
entered
the
room
i
thought
that
we
might
take
a
drive
in
the
champs
elysees
to
try
the
go
without
me
said
camusot
in
a
melancholy
voice
i
shall
not
dine
with
you
it
is
my
wife
s
birthday
i
had
forgotten
poor
musot
how
badly
bored
you
will
be
she
said
putting
her
arms
about
his
neck
she
was
wild
with
joy
at
the
thought
that
she
and
lucien
would
handsel
this
gift
together
she
would
drive
with
him
in
the
new
carriage
and
in
her
happiness
she
seemed
to
love
camusot
she
lavished
caresses
upon
him
if
only
i
could
give
you
a
carriage
every
day
said
the
poor
fellow
now
sir
it
is
two
o
clock
she
said
turning
to
lucien
who
stood
in
distress
and
confusion
but
she
comforted
him
with
an
adorable
gesture
down
the
stairs
she
went
several
steps
at
a
time
drawing
lucien
after
her
the
elderly
merchant
following
in
their
wake
like
a
seal
on
land
and
quite
unable
to
catch
them
up
lucien
enjoyed
the
most
intoxicating
of
pleasures
happiness
had
increased
coralie
s
loveliness
to
the
highest
possible
degree
she
appeared
before
all
eyes
an
exquisite
vision
in
her
dainty
toilette
all
paris
in
the
champs
elysees
beheld
the
lovers
in
an
avenue
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
they
met
a
caleche
mme
d
espard
and
mme
de
bargeton
looked
in
surprise
at
lucien
and
met
a
scornful
glance
from
the
poet
he
saw
glimpses
of
a
great
future
before
him
and
was
about
to
make
his
power
felt
he
could
fling
them
back
in
a
glance
some
of
the
revengeful
thoughts
which
had
gnawed
his
heart
ever
since
they
planted
them
there
that
moment
was
one
of
the
sweetest
in
his
life
and
perhaps
decided
his
fate
once
again
the
furies
seized
on
lucien
at
the
bidding
of
pride
he
would
reappear
in
the
world
of
paris
he
would
take
a
signal
revenge
all
the
social
pettiness
hitherto
trodden
under
foot
by
the
worker
the
member
of
the
brotherhood
sprang
up
again
afresh
in
his
soul
now
he
understood
all
that
lousteau
s
attack
had
meant
lousteau
had
served
his
passions
while
the
brotherhood
that
collective
mentor
had
seemed
to
mortify
them
in
the
interests
of
tiresome
virtues
and
work
which
began
to
look
useless
and
hopeless
in
lucien
s
eyes
work
what
is
it
but
death
to
an
eager
nature
and
how
easy
it
is
for
the
man
of
letters
to
slide
into
a
existence
of
into
the
luxurious
ways
of
actresses
and
women
of
easy
virtues
lucien
felt
an
overmastering
desire
to
continue
the
reckless
life
of
the
last
two
days
the
dinner
at
the
de
was
exquisite
all
florine
s
supper
guests
were
there
except
the
minister
the
duke
and
the
dancer
camusot
too
was
absent
but
these
gaps
were
filled
by
two
famous
actors
and
hector
merlin
and
his
mistress
this
charming
woman
who
chose
to
be
known
as
mme
du
was
the
handsomest
and
most
fashionable
of
the
class
of
women
now
euphemistically
styled
lucien
had
spent
the
hours
since
the
success
of
his
article
in
paradise
he
was
feted
and
envied
he
gained
his
talk
sparkled
he
was
the
brilliant
lucien
de
rubempre
who
shone
for
a
few
months
in
the
world
of
letters
and
art
finot
with
his
infallible
instinct
for
discovering
ability
scenting
it
afar
as
an
ogre
might
scent
human
flesh
cajoled
lucien
and
did
his
best
to
secure
a
recruit
for
the
squadron
under
his
command
and
coralie
watched
the
manoeuvres
of
this
purveyor
of
brains
saw
that
lucien
was
nibbling
at
the
bait
and
tried
to
put
him
on
his
guard
don
t
make
any
engagement
dear
boy
wait
they
want
to
exploit
you
we
will
talk
of
it
pshaw
said
lucien
i
am
sure
i
am
quite
as
sharp
and
shrewd
as
they
can
finot
and
hector
merlin
evidently
had
not
fallen
out
over
that
affair
of
the
white
lines
and
spaces
in
the
columns
for
it
was
finot
who
introduced
lucien
to
the
journalist
coralie
and
mme
du
were
overwhelmingly
amiable
and
polite
to
each
other
and
mme
du
asked
lucien
and
coralie
to
dine
with
her
hector
merlin
short
and
thin
with
lips
always
tightly
compressed
was
the
most
dangerous
journalist
present
unbounded
ambition
and
jealousy
smouldered
within
him
he
took
pleasure
in
the
pain
of
others
and
fomented
strife
to
turn
it
to
his
own
account
his
abilities
were
but
slender
and
he
had
little
force
of
character
but
the
natural
instinct
which
draws
the
upstart
towards
money
and
power
served
him
as
well
as
fixity
of
purpose
lucien
and
merlin
at
once
took
a
dislike
to
one
another
for
reasons
not
far
to
seek
merlin
unfortunately
proclaimed
aloud
the
thoughts
that
lucien
kept
to
himself
by
the
time
the
dessert
was
put
on
the
table
the
most
touching
friendship
appeared
to
prevail
among
the
men
each
one
of
whom
in
his
heart
thought
himself
a
cleverer
fellow
than
the
rest
and
lucien
as
the
newcomer
was
made
much
of
by
them
all
they
chatted
frankly
and
unrestrainedly
hector
merlin
alone
did
not
join
in
the
laughter
lucien
asked
the
reason
of
his
reserve
you
are
just
entering
the
world
of
letters
i
can
see
he
said
you
are
a
journalist
with
all
your
illusions
left
you
believe
in
friendship
here
we
are
friends
or
foes
as
it
happens
we
strike
down
a
friend
with
the
weapon
which
by
rights
should
only
be
turned
against
an
enemy
you
will
find
out
before
very
long
that
fine
sentiments
will
do
nothing
for
you
if
you
are
naturally
kindly
learn
to
be
to
be
consistently
spiteful
if
you
have
never
heard
this
golden
rule
before
i
give
it
you
now
in
confidence
and
it
is
no
small
secret
if
you
have
a
mind
to
be
loved
never
leave
your
mistress
until
you
have
made
her
shed
a
tear
or
two
and
if
you
mean
to
make
your
way
in
literature
let
other
people
continually
feel
your
teeth
make
no
exception
even
of
your
friends
wound
their
susceptibilities
and
everybody
will
fawn
upon
hector
merlin
watched
lucien
as
he
spoke
saw
that
his
words
went
to
the
neophyte
s
heart
like
a
stab
and
hector
merlin
was
glad
play
followed
lucien
lost
all
his
money
and
coralie
brought
him
away
and
he
forgot
for
a
while
in
the
delights
of
love
the
fierce
excitement
of
the
gambler
which
was
to
gain
so
strong
a
hold
upon
him
when
he
left
coralie
in
the
morning
and
returned
to
the
latin
quarter
he
took
out
his
purse
and
found
the
money
he
had
lost
at
first
he
felt
miserable
over
the
discovery
and
thought
of
going
back
at
once
to
return
a
gift
which
humiliated
him
but
he
had
already
come
as
far
as
the
rue
de
la
harpe
he
would
not
return
now
that
he
had
almost
reached
the
hotel
de
cluny
he
pondered
over
coralie
s
forethought
as
he
went
till
he
saw
in
it
a
proof
of
the
maternal
love
which
is
blended
with
passion
in
women
of
her
stamp
for
coralie
and
her
like
passion
includes
every
human
affection
lucien
went
from
thought
to
thought
and
argued
himself
into
accepting
the
gift
i
love
her
he
said
we
shall
live
together
as
husband
and
wife
i
will
never
forsake
her
what
mortal
short
of
a
diogenes
could
fail
to
understand
lucien
s
feelings
as
he
climbed
the
dirty
fetid
staircase
to
his
lodging
turned
the
key
that
grated
in
the
lock
and
entered
and
looked
round
at
the
unswept
brick
floor
at
the
cheerless
grate
at
the
ugly
poverty
and
bareness
of
the
room
a
package
of
manuscript
was
lying
on
the
table
it
was
his
novel
a
note
from
daniel
d
arthez
lay
beside
it
our
friends
are
almost
satisfied
with
your
work
dear
poet
d
arthez
wrote
you
will
be
able
to
present
it
with
more
confidence
now
they
say
to
friends
and
enemies
we
saw
your
charming
article
on
the
you
are
sure
to
excite
as
much
jealousy
in
the
profession
as
regret
among
your
friends
here
regrets
what
does
he
mean
exclaimed
lucien
the
polite
tone
of
the
note
astonished
him
was
he
to
be
henceforth
a
stranger
to
the
brotherhood
he
had
learned
to
set
a
higher
value
on
the
good
opinion
and
the
friendship
of
the
circle
in
the
rue
des
since
he
had
tasted
of
the
delicious
fruits
offered
to
him
by
the
eve
of
the
theatrical
underworld
for
some
moments
he
stood
in
deep
thought
he
saw
his
present
in
the
garret
and
foresaw
his
future
in
coralie
s
rooms
honorable
resolution
struggled
with
temptation
and
swayed
him
now
this
way
now
that
he
sat
down
and
began
to
look
through
his
manuscript
to
see
in
what
condition
his
friends
had
returned
it
to
him
what
was
his
amazement
as
he
read
chapter
after
chapter
to
find
his
poverty
transmuted
into
riches
by
the
cunning
of
the
pen
and
the
devotion
of
the
unknown
great
men
his
friends
of
the
brotherhood
dialogue
closely
packed
nervous
pregnant
terse
and
full
of
the
spirit
of
the
age
replaced
his
conversations
which
seemed
poor
and
pointless
prattle
in
comparison
his
characters
a
little
uncertain
in
the
drawing
now
stood
out
in
vigorous
contrast
of
color
and
relief
physiological
observations
due
no
doubt
to
horace
bianchon
supplied
links
of
interpretations
between
human
character
and
the
curious
phenomena
of
human
life
subtle
touches
which
made
his
men
and
women
live
his
wordy
passages
of
description
were
condensed
and
vivid
the
misshapen
child
of
his
brain
had
returned
to
him
as
a
lovely
maiden
with
white
robes
and
girdle
and
scarf
an
entrancing
creation
night
fell
and
took
him
by
surprise
reading
through
rising
tears
stricken
to
earth
by
such
greatness
of
soul
feeling
the
worth
of
such
a
lesson
admiring
the
alterations
which
taught
him
more
of
literature
and
art
than
all
his
four
years
apprenticeship
of
study
and
reading
and
comparison
a
master
s
correction
of
a
line
made
upon
the
study
always
teaches
more
than
all
the
theories
and
criticisms
in
the
world
what
friends
are
these
what
hearts
how
fortunate
i
am
he
cried
grasping
his
manuscript
tightly
with
the
quick
impulsiveness
of
a
poetic
and
mobile
temperament
he
rushed
off
to
daniel
s
lodging
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
and
thought
of
these
friends
who
refused
to
leave
the
path
of
honor
he
felt
conscious
that
he
was
less
worthy
of
them
than
before
a
voice
spoke
within
him
telling
him
that
if
d
arthez
had
loved
coralie
he
would
have
had
her
break
with
camusot
and
besides
this
he
knew
that
the
brotherhood
held
journalism
in
utter
abhorrence
and
that
he
himself
was
already
to
some
small
extent
a
journalist
all
of
them
except
meyraux
who
had
just
gone
out
were
in
d
arthez
s
room
when
he
entered
it
and
saw
that
all
their
faces
were
full
of
sorrow
and
despair
what
is
it
he
cried
we
have
just
heard
news
of
a
dreadful
catastrophe
the
greatest
thinker
of
the
age
our
most
loved
friend
who
was
like
a
light
among
us
for
two
years
louis
lambert
has
fallen
a
victim
to
catalepsy
there
is
no
hope
for
him
said
bianchon
he
will
die
his
soul
wandering
in
the
skies
his
body
unconscious
on
earth
said
michel
chrestien
solemnly
he
will
die
as
he
lived
said
d
arthez
love
fell
like
a
firebrand
in
the
vast
empire
of
his
brain
and
burned
him
away
said
leon
giraud
yes
said
joseph
bridau
he
has
reached
a
height
that
we
can
not
so
much
as
are
to
be
pitied
not
louis
said
fulgence
ridal
perhaps
he
will
recover
exclaimed
lucien
from
what
meyraux
has
been
telling
us
recovery
seems
impossible
answered
bianchon
medicine
has
no
power
over
the
change
that
is
working
in
his
yet
there
are
physical
means
said
d
arthez
yes
said
bianchon
we
might
produce
imbecility
instead
of
is
there
no
way
of
offering
another
head
to
the
spirit
of
evil
i
would
give
mine
to
save
him
cried
michel
chrestien
and
what
would
become
of
european
federation
asked
d
arthez
ah
true
replied
michel
chrestien
our
duty
to
humanity
comes
first
to
one
man
i
came
here
with
a
heart
full
of
gratitude
to
you
all
said
lucien
you
have
changed
my
alloy
into
golden
gratitude
for
what
do
you
take
us
asked
bianchon
we
had
the
pleasure
added
fulgence
well
so
you
are
a
journalist
are
you
asked
leon
giraud
the
fame
of
your
first
appearance
has
reached
even
the
latin
i
am
not
a
journalist
yet
returned
lucien
aha
so
much
the
better
said
michel
chrestien
i
told
you
so
said
d
arthez
lucien
knows
the
value
of
a
clean
conscience
when
you
can
say
to
yourself
as
you
lay
your
head
on
the
pillow
at
night
i
have
not
sat
in
judgment
on
another
man
s
work
i
have
given
pain
to
no
one
i
have
not
used
the
edge
of
my
wit
to
deal
a
stab
to
some
harmless
soul
i
have
sacrificed
no
one
s
success
to
a
jest
i
have
not
even
troubled
the
happiness
of
imbecility
i
have
not
added
to
the
burdens
of
genius
i
have
scorned
the
easy
triumphs
of
epigram
in
short
i
have
not
acted
against
my
convictions
is
not
this
a
viaticum
that
gives
one
daily
strength
but
one
can
say
all
this
surely
and
yet
work
on
a
newspaper
said
lucien
if
i
had
absolutely
no
other
way
of
earning
a
living
i
should
certainly
come
to
oh
oh
oh
cried
fulgence
his
voice
rising
a
note
each
time
we
are
capitulating
are
we
he
will
turn
journalist
leon
giraud
said
gravely
oh
lucien
if
you
would
only
stay
and
work
with
us
we
are
about
to
bring
out
a
periodical
in
which
justice
and
truth
shall
never
be
violated
we
will
spread
doctrines
that
perhaps
will
be
of
real
service
to
mankind
you
will
not
have
a
single
subscriber
lucien
broke
in
with
machiavellian
wisdom
there
will
be
five
hundred
of
them
asserted
michel
chrestien
but
they
will
be
worth
five
hundred
you
will
need
a
lot
of
capital
continued
lucien
no
only
devotion
said
d
arthez
anybody
might
take
him
for
a
perfumer
s
assistant
burst
out
michel
chrestien
looking
at
lucien
s
head
and
sniffing
comically
you
were
seen
driving
about
in
a
very
smart
turnout
with
a
pair
of
thoroughbreds
and
a
mistress
for
a
prince
coralie
well
and
is
there
any
harm
in
it
you
would
not
say
that
if
you
thought
that
there
was
no
harm
in
it
said
bianchon
i
could
have
wished
lucien
a
beatrice
said
d
arthez
a
noble
woman
who
would
have
been
a
help
to
him
in
life
but
daniel
asked
lucien
love
is
love
wherever
you
find
it
is
it
not
ah
said
the
republican
member
on
that
one
point
i
am
an
aristocrat
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
love
a
woman
who
must
rub
shoulders
with
all
sorts
of
people
in
the
whom
an
actor
kisses
on
stage
she
must
lower
herself
before
the
public
smile
on
every
one
lift
her
skirts
as
she
dances
and
dress
like
a
man
that
all
the
world
may
see
what
none
should
see
save
i
alone
or
if
i
loved
such
a
woman
she
should
leave
the
stage
and
my
love
should
cleanse
her
from
the
stain
of
and
if
she
would
not
leave
the
stage
i
should
die
of
mortification
jealousy
and
all
sorts
of
pain
you
can
not
pluck
love
out
of
your
heart
as
you
draw
a
lucien
s
face
grew
dark
and
thoughtful
when
they
find
out
that
i
am
tolerating
camusot
how
they
will
despise
me
he
thought
look
here
said
the
fierce
republican
with
humorous
fierceness
you
can
be
a
great
writer
but
a
little
you
shall
never
be
and
he
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
he
is
hard
is
michel
chrestien
commented
lucien
hard
and
salutary
like
the
dentist
s
pincers
said
bianchon
michel
foresees
your
future
perhaps
in
the
street
at
this
moment
he
is
thinking
of
you
with
tears
in
his
d
arthez
was
kind
and
talked
comfortingly
and
tried
to
cheer
lucien
the
poet
spent
an
hour
with
his
friends
then
he
went
but
his
conscience
treated
him
hardly
crying
to
him
you
will
be
a
journalist
a
journalist
as
the
witch
cried
to
macbeth
that
he
should
be
king
hereafter
out
in
the
street
he
looked
up
at
d
arthez
s
windows
and
saw
a
faint
light
shining
in
them
and
his
heart
sank
a
dim
foreboding
told
him
that
he
had
bidden
his
friends
for
the
last
time
as
he
turned
out
of
the
place
de
la
sorbonne
into
the
rue
de
cluny
he
saw
a
carriage
at
the
door
of
his
lodging
coralie
had
driven
all
the
way
from
the
boulevard
du
temple
for
the
sake
of
a
moment
with
her
lover
and
a
lucien
found
her
sobbing
in
his
garret
she
would
be
as
wretchedly
poor
as
her
poet
she
wept
as
she
arranged
his
shirts
and
gloves
and
handkerchiefs
in
the
crazy
chest
of
drawers
her
distress
was
so
real
and
so
great
that
lucien
but
even
now
chidden
for
his
connection
with
an
actress
saw
coralie
as
a
saint
ready
to
assume
the
of
poverty
the
adorable
girl
s
excuse
for
her
visit
was
an
announcement
that
the
firm
of
camusot
coralie
and
lucien
meant
to
invite
matifat
florine
and
lousteau
the
second
trio
to
supper
had
lucien
any
invitations
to
issue
to
people
who
might
be
useful
to
him
lucien
said
that
he
would
take
counsel
of
lousteau
a
few
moments
were
spent
together
and
coralie
hurried
away
she
spared
lucien
the
knowledge
that
camusot
was
waiting
for
her
below
next
morning
at
eight
o
clock
lucien
went
to
etienne
lousteau
s
room
found
it
empty
and
hurried
away
to
florine
lousteau
and
florine
settled
into
possession
of
their
new
quarters
like
a
married
couple
received
their
friend
in
the
pretty
bedroom
and
all
three
breakfasted
sumptuously
together
why
i
should
advise
you
my
boy
to
come
with
me
to
see
felicien
vernou
said
lousteau
when
they
sat
at
table
and
lucien
had
mentioned
coralie
s
projected
supper
ask
him
to
be
of
the
party
and
keep
well
with
him
if
you
can
keep
well
with
such
a
rascal
felicien
vernou
does
a
for
a
political
paper
he
might
perhaps
introduce
you
and
you
could
blossom
out
into
leaders
in
it
at
your
ease
it
is
a
liberal
paper
like
ours
you
will
be
a
liberal
that
is
the
popular
party
and
besides
if
you
mean
to
go
over
to
the
ministerialists
you
would
do
better
for
yourself
if
they
had
reason
to
be
afraid
of
you
then
there
is
hector
merlin
and
his
mme
du
you
meet
great
people
at
their
house
dukes
and
dandies
and
millionaires
didn
t
they
ask
you
and
coralie
to
dine
with
them
yes
replied
lucien
you
are
going
too
and
so
is
lucien
and
etienne
were
now
on
familiar
terms
after
friday
s
debauch
and
the
dinner
at
the
de
very
well
merlin
is
on
the
paper
we
shall
come
across
him
pretty
often
he
is
the
chap
to
follow
close
on
finot
s
heels
you
would
do
well
to
pay
him
attention
ask
him
and
mme
du
to
supper
he
may
be
useful
to
you
before
long
for
rancorous
people
are
always
in
need
of
others
and
he
may
do
you
a
good
turn
if
he
can
reckon
on
your
your
beginning
has
made
enough
sensation
to
smooth
your
way
said
florine
take
advantage
of
it
at
once
or
you
will
soon
be
the
bargain
the
great
business
is
concluded
lousteau
continued
that
finot
without
a
spark
of
talent
in
him
is
to
be
editor
of
dauriat
s
weekly
paper
with
a
salary
of
six
hundred
francs
per
month
and
owner
of
a
sixth
share
for
which
he
has
not
paid
one
penny
and
i
my
dear
fellow
am
now
editor
of
our
little
paper
everything
went
off
as
i
expected
florine
managed
superbly
she
could
give
points
to
tallyrand
we
have
a
hold
on
men
through
their
pleasures
said
florine
while
a
diplomatist
only
works
on
their
a
diplomatist
sees
a
man
made
up
for
the
occasion
we
know
him
in
his
moments
of
folly
so
our
power
is
and
when
the
thing
was
settled
matifat
made
the
first
and
last
joke
of
his
whole
druggist
s
career
put
in
lousteau
he
said
this
affair
is
quite
in
my
line
i
am
supplying
drugs
to
the
i
suspect
that
florine
put
him
up
to
it
cried
lucien
and
by
these
means
my
little
dear
your
foot
is
in
the
stirrup
continued
lousteau
you
were
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
your
mouth
remarked
florine
what
lots
of
young
fellows
wait
for
years
wait
till
they
are
sick
of
waiting
for
a
chance
to
get
an
article
into
a
paper
you
will
do
like
emile
blondet
in
six
months
time
you
will
be
giving
yourself
high
and
mighty
airs
she
added
with
a
mocking
smile
in
the
language
of
her
class
haven
t
i
been
in
paris
for
three
years
said
lousteau
and
only
yesterday
finot
began
to
pay
me
a
fixed
monthly
salary
of
three
hundred
francs
and
a
hundred
francs
per
sheet
for
his
well
you
are
saying
nothing
exclaimed
florine
with
her
eyes
turned
on
lucien
we
shall
see
said
lucien
my
dear
boy
if
you
had
been
my
brother
i
could
not
have
done
more
for
you
retorted
lousteau
somewhat
nettled
but
i
won
t
answer
for
finot
scores
of
sharp
fellows
will
besiege
finot
for
the
next
two
days
with
offers
to
work
for
low
pay
i
have
promised
for
you
but
you
can
draw
back
if
you
you
little
know
how
lucky
you
are
he
added
after
a
pause
all
those
in
our
set
combine
to
attack
an
enemy
in
various
papers
and
lend
each
other
a
helping
hand
all
let
us
go
in
the
first
place
to
felicien
vernou
said
lucien
he
was
eager
to
conclude
an
alliance
with
such
formidable
birds
of
prey
lousteau
sent
for
a
cab
and
the
pair
of
friends
drove
to
vernou
s
house
on
the
second
floor
up
an
alley
in
the
rue
mandar
to
lucien
s
great
astonishment
the
harsh
fastidious
and
severe
critic
s
surroundings
were
vulgar
to
the
last
degree
a
marbled
paper
cheap
and
shabby
with
a
meaningless
pattern
repeated
at
regular
intervals
covered
the
walls
and
a
series
of
aqua
tints
in
gilt
frames
decorated
the
apartment
where
vernou
sat
at
table
with
a
woman
so
plain
that
she
could
only
be
the
legitimate
mistress
of
the
house
and
two
very
small
children
perched
on
high
chairs
with
a
bar
in
front
to
prevent
the
infants
from
tumbling
out
felicien
vernou
in
a
cotton
contrived
out
of
the
remains
of
one
of
his
wife
s
dresses
was
not
over
well
pleased
by
this
invasion
have
you
breakfasted
lousteau
he
asked
placing
a
chair
for
lucien
we
have
just
left
florine
we
have
been
breakfasting
with
lucien
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
mme
vernou
she
looked
like
a
stout
homely
cook
with
a
tolerably
fair
complexion
but
commonplace
to
the
last
degree
the
lady
wore
a
bandana
tied
over
her
the
strings
of
the
latter
article
of
dress
being
tied
so
tightly
under
the
chin
that
her
puffy
cheeks
stood
out
on
either
side
a
shapeless
beltless
garment
fastened
by
a
single
button
at
the
throat
enveloped
her
from
head
to
foot
in
such
a
fashion
that
a
comparison
to
a
milestone
at
once
suggested
itself
her
health
left
no
room
for
hope
her
cheeks
were
almost
purple
her
fingers
looked
like
sausages
in
a
moment
it
dawned
upon
lucien
how
it
was
that
vernou
was
always
so
ill
at
ease
in
society
here
was
the
living
explanation
of
his
misanthropy
sick
of
his
marriage
unable
to
bring
himself
to
abandon
his
wife
and
family
he
had
yet
sufficient
of
the
artistic
temper
to
suffer
continually
from
their
presence
vernou
was
an
actor
by
nature
bound
never
to
pardon
the
success
of
another
condemned
to
chronic
discontent
because
he
was
never
content
with
himself
lucien
began
to
understand
the
sour
look
which
seemed
to
add
to
the
bleak
expression
of
envy
on
vernou
s
face
the
acerbity
of
the
epigrams
with
which
his
conversation
was
sown
the
journalist
s
pungent
phrases
keen
and
elaborately
wrought
as
a
stiletto
were
at
once
explained
let
us
go
into
my
study
vernou
said
rising
from
the
table
you
have
come
on
business
no
yes
and
no
replied
etienne
lousteau
it
is
a
supper
old
i
have
brought
a
message
from
coralie
said
lucien
mme
vernou
looked
up
at
once
at
the
name
to
ask
you
to
supper
at
her
house
to
meet
the
same
company
as
before
at
florine
s
and
a
few
more
besides
hector
merlin
and
mme
du
and
some
others
there
will
be
play
but
we
are
engaged
to
mme
mahoudeau
this
evening
dear
put
in
the
wife
what
does
that
matter
returned
vernou
she
will
take
offence
if
we
don
t
go
and
you
are
very
glad
of
her
when
you
have
a
bill
to
this
wife
of
mine
my
dear
boy
can
never
be
made
to
understand
that
a
supper
engagement
for
twelve
o
clock
does
not
prevent
you
from
going
to
an
evening
party
that
comes
to
an
end
at
eleven
she
is
always
with
me
while
i
work
he
added
you
have
so
much
imagination
said
lucien
and
thereby
made
a
mortal
enemy
of
vernou
well
continued
lousteau
you
are
coming
but
that
is
not
all
de
rubempre
is
about
to
be
one
of
us
so
you
must
push
him
in
your
paper
give
him
out
for
a
chap
that
will
make
a
name
for
himself
in
literature
so
that
he
can
put
in
at
least
a
couple
of
articles
every
yes
if
he
means
to
be
one
of
us
and
will
attack
our
enemies
as
we
will
attack
his
i
will
say
a
word
for
him
at
the
opera
replied
vernou
very
well
till
my
boy
said
lousteau
shaking
hands
with
every
sign
of
cordiality
when
is
your
book
coming
out
that
depends
on
dauriat
it
is
ready
said
vernou
are
you
satisfied
yes
and
no
we
will
get
up
a
success
said
lousteau
and
he
rose
with
a
bow
to
his
colleague
s
wife
the
abrupt
departure
was
necessary
indeed
for
the
two
infants
engaged
in
a
noisy
quarrel
were
fighting
with
their
spoons
and
flinging
the
pap
in
each
other
s
faces
that
my
boy
is
a
woman
who
all
unconsciously
will
work
great
havoc
in
contemporary
literature
said
etienne
when
they
came
away
poor
vernou
can
not
forgive
us
for
his
wife
he
ought
to
be
relieved
of
her
in
the
interests
of
the
public
and
a
deluge
of
reviews
and
stinging
sarcasms
against
successful
men
of
every
sort
would
be
averted
what
is
to
become
of
a
man
with
such
a
wife
and
that
pair
of
abominable
brats
have
you
seen
rigaudin
in
picard
s
maison
en
you
have
well
like
rigaudin
vernou
will
not
fight
himself
but
he
will
set
others
fighting
he
would
give
an
eye
to
put
out
both
eyes
in
the
head
of
the
best
friend
he
has
you
will
see
him
using
the
bodies
of
the
slain
for
a
rejoicing
over
every
one
s
misfortunes
attacking
princes
dukes
marquises
and
nobles
because
he
himself
is
a
commoner
reviling
the
work
of
unmarried
men
because
he
forsooth
has
a
wife
and
everlastingly
preaching
morality
the
joys
of
domestic
life
and
the
duties
of
the
citizen
in
short
this
very
moral
critic
will
spare
no
one
not
even
infants
of
tender
age
he
lives
in
the
rue
mandar
with
a
wife
who
might
be
the
of
the
and
a
couple
of
little
vernous
as
ugly
as
sin
he
tries
to
sneer
at
the
faubourg
where
he
will
never
set
foot
and
makes
his
duchesses
talk
like
his
wife
that
is
the
sort
of
man
to
raise
a
howl
at
the
jesuits
insult
the
court
and
credit
the
court
party
with
the
design
of
restoring
feudal
rights
and
the
right
of
primogeniture
just
the
one
to
preach
a
crusade
for
equality
he
that
thinks
himself
the
equal
of
no
one
if
he
were
a
bachelor
he
would
go
into
society
if
he
were
in
a
fair
way
to
be
a
royalist
poet
with
a
pension
and
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
he
would
be
an
optimist
and
journalism
offers
by
the
hundred
journalism
is
the
giant
catapult
set
in
motion
by
pigmy
hatreds
have
you
any
wish
to
marry
after
this
vernou
has
none
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
in
him
it
is
all
turned
to
gall
and
he
is
emphatically
the
journalist
a
tiger
with
two
hands
that
tears
everything
to
pieces
as
if
his
pen
had
the
it
is
a
case
of
gunophobia
said
lucien
has
he
ability
he
is
witty
he
is
a
writer
of
articles
he
incubates
articles
he
does
that
all
his
life
and
nothing
else
the
most
dogged
industry
would
fail
to
graft
a
book
on
his
prose
felicien
is
incapable
of
conceiving
a
work
on
a
large
scale
of
broad
effects
of
fitting
characters
harmoniously
in
a
plot
which
develops
till
it
reaches
a
climax
he
has
ideas
but
he
has
no
knowledge
of
facts
his
heroes
are
utopian
creatures
philosophical
or
liberal
notions
masquerading
he
is
at
pains
to
write
an
original
style
but
his
inflated
periods
would
collapse
at
a
from
a
critic
and
therefore
he
goes
in
terror
of
reviews
like
every
one
else
who
can
only
keep
his
head
above
water
with
the
bladders
of
newspaper
what
an
article
you
are
making
out
of
him
that
particular
kind
my
boy
must
be
spoken
and
never
you
are
turning
editor
said
lucien
where
shall
i
put
you
down
at
coralie
ah
we
are
infatuated
said
lousteau
what
a
mistake
do
as
i
do
with
florine
let
coralie
be
your
housekeeper
and
take
your
you
would
send
a
saint
to
perdition
laughed
lucien
well
there
is
no
damning
a
devil
retorted
lousteau
the
flippant
tone
the
brilliant
talk
of
this
new
friend
his
views
of
life
his
paradoxes
the
axioms
of
parisian
machiavelism
all
these
things
impressed
lucien
unawares
theoretically
the
poet
knew
that
such
thoughts
were
perilous
but
he
believed
them
practically
useful
arrived
in
the
boulevard
du
temple
the
friends
agreed
to
meet
at
the
office
between
four
and
five
o
clock
hector
merlin
would
doubtless
be
there
lousteau
was
right
the
infatuation
of
desire
was
upon
lucien
for
the
courtesan
who
loves
knows
how
to
grapple
her
lover
to
her
by
every
weakness
in
his
nature
fashioning
herself
with
incredible
flexibility
to
his
every
wish
encouraging
the
soft
effeminate
habits
which
strengthen
her
hold
lucien
was
thirsting
already
for
enjoyment
he
was
in
love
with
the
easy
luxurious
and
expensive
life
which
the
actress
led
he
found
coralie
and
camusot
intoxicated
with
joy
the
gymnase
offered
coralie
an
engagement
after
easter
on
terms
for
which
she
had
never
dared
to
hope
and
this
great
success
is
owing
to
you
said
camusot
yes
surely
would
have
fallen
flat
but
for
him
cried
coralie
if
there
had
been
no
article
i
should
have
been
in
for
another
six
years
of
the
boulevard
she
danced
up
to
lucien
and
flung
her
arms
round
him
putting
an
indescribable
silken
softness
and
sweetness
into
her
enthusiasm
love
had
come
to
coralie
and
camusot
his
eyes
fell
looking
down
after
the
wont
of
mankind
in
moments
of
sharp
pain
he
saw
the
seam
of
lucien
s
boots
a
deep
yellow
thread
used
by
the
best
bootmakers
of
that
time
in
strong
contrast
with
the
glistening
leather
the
color
of
that
seam
had
tinged
his
thoughts
during
a
previous
conversation
with
himself
as
he
sought
to
explain
the
presence
of
a
mysterious
pair
of
hessians
in
coralie
s
fender
he
remembered
now
that
he
had
seen
the
name
of
gay
rue
de
la
michodiere
printed
in
black
letters
on
the
soft
white
kid
lining
you
have
a
handsome
pair
of
boots
sir
he
said
like
everything
else
about
him
said
coralie
i
should
be
very
glad
of
your
bootmaker
s
oh
how
like
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
to
ask
for
a
tradesman
s
address
cried
coralie
do
intend
to
patronize
a
young
man
s
bootmaker
a
nice
young
man
you
would
make
do
keep
to
your
own
they
are
the
kind
for
a
man
with
a
wife
and
family
and
a
indeed
if
you
would
take
off
one
of
your
boots
sir
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
persisted
camusot
i
could
not
get
it
on
again
without
a
said
lucien
flushing
up
berenice
will
fetch
you
one
we
can
do
with
some
here
jeered
camusot
papa
camusot
said
coralie
looking
at
him
with
cruel
scorn
have
the
courage
of
your
pitiful
baseness
come
speak
out
you
think
that
this
gentleman
s
boots
are
very
like
mine
do
you
not
i
forbid
you
to
take
off
your
boots
she
added
turning
to
yes
camusot
yes
you
saw
some
boots
lying
about
in
the
fender
here
the
other
day
and
that
is
the
identical
pair
and
this
gentleman
was
hiding
in
my
at
the
time
waiting
for
them
and
he
had
passed
the
night
here
that
was
what
you
were
thinking
think
so
i
would
rather
you
did
it
is
the
simple
truth
i
am
deceiving
you
and
if
i
am
i
do
it
to
please
she
sat
down
there
was
no
anger
in
her
face
no
embarrassment
she
looked
from
camusot
to
lucien
the
two
men
avoided
each
other
s
eyes
i
will
believe
nothing
that
you
do
not
wish
me
to
believe
said
camusot
don
t
play
with
me
coralie
i
was
wrong
i
am
either
a
shameless
baggage
that
has
taken
a
sudden
fancy
or
a
poor
unhappy
girl
who
feels
what
love
really
is
for
the
first
time
the
love
that
all
women
long
for
and
whichever
way
it
is
you
must
leave
me
or
take
me
as
i
am
she
said
with
a
queenly
gesture
that
crushed
camusot
is
it
really
true
he
asked
seeing
from
their
faces
that
this
was
no
jest
yet
begging
to
be
deceived
i
love
mademoiselle
lucien
faltered
out
at
that
word
coralie
sprang
to
her
poet
and
held
him
tightly
to
her
then
with
her
arms
still
about
him
she
turned
to
the
as
if
to
bid
him
see
the
beautiful
picture
made
by
two
young
lovers
poor
musot
take
all
that
you
gave
to
me
back
again
i
do
not
want
to
keep
anything
of
yours
for
i
love
this
boy
here
madly
not
for
his
intellect
but
for
his
beauty
i
would
rather
starve
with
him
than
have
millions
with
camusot
sank
into
a
low
chair
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
said
not
a
word
would
you
like
us
to
go
away
she
asked
there
was
a
note
of
ferocity
in
her
voice
which
no
words
can
describe
cold
chills
ran
down
lucien
s
spine
he
beheld
himself
burdened
with
a
woman
an
actress
and
a
household
stay
here
coralie
keep
it
all
the
old
tradesman
said
at
last
in
a
faint
unsteady
voice
that
came
from
his
heart
i
don
t
want
anything
back
there
is
the
worth
of
sixty
thousand
francs
here
in
the
furniture
but
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
my
coralie
in
want
and
yet
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
come
to
want
however
great
this
gentleman
s
talent
may
be
he
can
t
afford
to
keep
you
we
old
fellows
must
expect
this
sort
of
thing
coralie
let
me
come
and
see
you
sometimes
i
may
be
of
use
to
you
and
i
confess
it
i
can
not
live
without
the
poor
man
s
gentleness
stripped
as
he
was
of
his
happiness
just
as
happiness
had
reached
its
height
touched
lucien
deeply
coralie
was
quite
unsoftened
by
it
come
as
often
as
you
wish
poor
musot
she
said
i
shall
like
you
all
the
better
when
i
don
t
pretend
to
love
camusot
seemed
to
be
resigned
to
his
fate
so
long
as
he
was
not
driven
out
of
the
earthly
paradise
in
which
his
life
could
not
have
been
all
joy
he
trusted
to
the
chances
of
life
in
paris
and
to
the
temptations
that
would
beset
lucien
s
path
he
would
wait
a
while
and
all
that
had
been
his
should
be
his
again
sooner
or
later
thought
the
wily
tradesman
this
handsome
young
fellow
would
be
unfaithful
he
would
keep
a
watch
on
him
and
the
better
to
do
this
and
use
his
opportunity
with
coralie
he
would
be
their
friend
the
persistent
passion
that
could
consent
to
such
humiliation
terrified
lucien
camusot
s
proposal
of
a
dinner
at
very
s
in
the
palais
royal
was
accepted
what
joy
cried
coralie
as
soon
as
camusot
had
departed
you
will
not
go
back
now
to
your
garret
in
the
latin
quarter
you
will
live
here
we
shall
always
be
together
you
can
take
a
room
in
the
rue
charlot
for
the
sake
of
appearances
and
le
she
began
to
dance
her
spanish
dance
with
an
excited
eagerness
that
revealed
the
strength
of
the
passion
in
her
heart
if
i
work
hard
i
may
make
five
hundred
francs
a
month
lucien
said
and
i
shall
make
as
much
again
at
the
theatre
without
counting
extras
camusot
will
pay
for
my
dresses
as
before
he
is
fond
of
me
we
can
live
like
croesus
on
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
and
the
horses
and
the
coachman
and
the
footman
inquired
berenice
i
will
get
into
debt
said
coralie
and
she
began
to
dance
with
lucien
i
must
close
with
finot
after
this
lucien
exclaimed
there
said
coralie
i
will
dress
and
take
you
to
your
office
i
will
wait
outside
in
the
boulevard
for
you
with
the
lucien
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
made
some
very
sober
reflections
as
he
watched
coralie
at
her
toilet
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
leave
coralie
free
than
to
start
all
at
once
with
such
an
establishment
but
coralie
was
there
before
his
eyes
and
coralie
was
so
lovely
so
graceful
so
bewitching
that
the
more
picturesque
aspects
of
bohemia
were
in
evidence
and
he
flung
down
the
gauntlet
to
fortune
berenice
was
ordered
to
superintend
lucien
s
removal
and
installation
and
coralie
triumphant
radiant
and
happy
carried
off
her
love
her
poet
and
must
needs
go
all
over
paris
on
the
way
to
the
rue
lucien
sprang
lightly
up
the
staircase
and
entered
the
office
with
an
air
of
being
quite
at
home
coloquinte
was
there
with
the
stamped
paper
still
on
his
head
and
old
giroudeau
told
him
again
hypocritically
enough
that
no
one
had
yet
come
in
but
the
editor
and
contributors
meet
somewhere
or
other
to
arrange
about
the
journal
said
lucien
very
likely
but
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
writing
of
the
paper
said
the
emperor
s
captain
resuming
his
occupation
of
checking
off
wrappers
with
his
eternal
broum
broum
was
it
lucky
or
unlucky
finot
chanced
to
come
in
at
that
very
moment
to
announce
his
sham
abdication
and
to
bid
giroudeau
watch
over
his
interests
no
with
this
gentleman
he
is
on
the
staff
finot
added
for
his
uncle
s
benefit
as
he
grasped
lucien
by
the
hand
oh
is
he
on
the
paper
exclaimed
giroudeau
much
surprised
at
this
friendliness
well
sir
you
came
on
without
much
i
want
to
make
things
snug
for
you
here
lest
etienne
should
bamboozle
you
continued
finot
looking
knowingly
at
lucien
this
gentleman
will
be
paid
three
francs
per
column
all
round
including
you
have
never
taken
any
one
on
such
terms
before
said
giroudeau
opening
his
eyes
and
he
will
take
the
four
boulevard
theatres
see
that
nobody
sneaks
his
boxes
and
that
he
gets
his
share
of
i
should
advise
you
nevertheless
to
have
them
sent
to
your
address
he
added
turning
to
and
he
agrees
to
write
besides
ten
miscellaneous
articles
of
two
columns
each
for
fifty
francs
per
month
for
one
year
does
that
suit
you
yes
said
lucien
circumstances
had
forced
his
hand
draw
up
the
agreement
uncle
and
we
will
sign
it
when
we
come
who
is
the
gentleman
inquired
giroudeau
rising
and
taking
off
his
black
silk
m
lucien
de
rubempre
who
wrote
the
article
on
young
man
you
have
a
gold
mine
said
the
old
soldier
tapping
lucien
on
the
forehead
i
am
not
literary
myself
but
i
read
that
article
of
yours
and
i
liked
it
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
there
s
gaiety
for
you
that
will
bring
us
new
subscribers
says
i
to
myself
and
so
it
did
we
sold
fifty
more
is
my
agreement
with
lousteau
made
out
in
duplicate
and
ready
to
sign
asked
finot
speaking
aside
then
this
gentleman
s
agreement
by
one
day
so
that
lousteau
will
be
bound
by
the
previous
finot
took
his
new
contributor
s
arm
with
a
friendliness
that
charmed
lucien
and
drew
him
out
on
the
landing
to
say
your
position
is
made
for
you
i
will
introduce
you
to
staff
myself
and
lousteau
will
go
round
with
you
to
the
theatres
you
can
make
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
per
month
on
this
little
paper
of
ours
with
lousteau
as
its
editor
so
try
to
keep
well
with
him
the
rogue
bears
a
grudge
against
me
as
it
is
for
tying
his
hands
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
but
you
have
ability
and
i
don
t
choose
that
you
shall
be
subjected
to
the
whims
of
the
editor
you
might
let
me
have
a
couple
of
sheets
every
month
for
my
review
and
i
will
pay
you
two
hundred
francs
this
is
between
ourselves
don
t
mention
it
to
anybody
else
i
should
be
laid
open
to
the
spite
of
every
one
whose
vanity
is
mortified
by
your
good
fortune
write
four
articles
fill
your
two
sheets
sign
two
with
your
own
name
and
two
with
a
pseudonym
so
that
you
may
not
seem
to
be
taking
the
bread
out
of
anybody
else
s
mouth
you
owe
your
position
to
blondet
and
vignon
they
think
that
you
have
a
future
before

friends
as
for

and
i
will

francs
worth
of
boxes
and
tickets
to

and
sixty
francs
worth
of
books
to
convert
into
cash

that
and
your
work
on
the
paper
you
will
be
making
four
hundred
and
fifty
francs
every
month
if
you
use
your
wits
you
will
find
ways
of
making
another
two
hundred
francs
at
least
among
the
publishers
they
will
pay
you
for
reviews
and
prospectuses
but
you
are
mine
are
you
not
i
can
count
upon
lucien
squeezed
finot
s
hand
in
transports
of
joy
which
no
words
can
express
don
t
let
any
one
see
that
anything
has
passed
between
us
said
finot
in
his
ear
and
he
flung
open
a
door
of
a
room
in
the
roof
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
on
the
fifth
floor
a
table
covered
with
a
green
cloth
was
drawn
up
to
a
blazing
fire
and
seated
in
various
chairs
and
lounges
lucien
discovered
lousteau
felicien
vernou
hector
merlin
and
two
others
unknown
to
him
all
laughing
or
smoking
a
real
inkstand
full
of
ink
this
time
stood
on
the
table
among
a
great
litter
of
papers
while
a
collection
of
pens
the
worse
for
wear
but
still
serviceable
for
journalists
told
the
new
contributor
very
plainly
that
the
mighty
enterprise
was
carried
on
in
this
apartment
gentlemen
said
finot
the
object
of
this
gathering
is
the
installation
of
our
friend
lousteau
in
my
place
as
editor
of
the
newspaper
which
i
am
compelled
to
relinquish
but
although
my
opinions
will
necessarily
undergo
a
transformation
when
i
accept
the
editorship
of
a
review
of
which
the
politics
are
known
to
you
my
remain
the
same
and
we
shall
be
friends
as
before
i
am
quite
at
your
service
and
you
likewise
will
be
ready
to
do
anything
for
me
circumstances
change
principles
are
fixed
principles
are
the
pivot
on
which
the
hands
of
the
political
barometer
there
was
an
instant
shout
of
laughter
who
put
that
into
your
mouth
asked
lousteau
blondet
said
finot
windy
showery
stormy
settled
fair
said
merlin
we
will
all
row
in
the
same
in
short
continued
finot
not
to
muddle
our
wits
with
metaphors
any
one
who
has
an
article
or
two
for
me
will
always
find
this
gentleman
turning
to
lucien
will
be
one
of
i
have
arranged
with
him
every
one
congratulated
finot
on
his
advance
and
new
prospects
so
there
you
are
mounted
on
our
shoulders
said
a
contributor
whom
lucien
did
not
know
you
will
be
the
janus
of
journal
so
long
as
he
isn
t
the
janot
put
in
vernou
are
you
going
to
allow
us
to
make
attacks
on
our
any
one
you
ah
yes
said
lousteau
but
the
paper
must
keep
on
its
lines
chatelet
is
very
wroth
we
shall
not
let
him
off
for
a
week
what
has
happened
asked
lucien
he
came
here
to
ask
for
an
explanation
said
vernou
the
imperial
buck
found
old
giroudeau
at
home
and
old
giroudeau
told
him
with
all
the
coolness
in
the
world
that
philippe
bridau
wrote
the
article
philippe
asked
the
baron
to
mention
the
time
and
the
weapons
and
there
it
ended
we
are
engaged
at
this
moment
in
offering
excuses
to
the
baron
in
s
issue
every
phrase
is
a
stab
for
keep
your
teeth
in
him
and
he
will
come
round
to
me
said
finot
and
it
will
look
as
if
i
were
obliging
him
by
appeasing
you
he
can
say
a
word
to
the
ministry
and
we
can
get
something
or
other
out
of
him
an
assistant
schoolmaster
s
place
or
a
tobacconist
s
license
it
is
a
lucky
thing
for
us
that
we
flicked
him
on
the
raw
does
anybody
here
care
to
take
a
serious
article
on
nathan
for
my
new
paper
give
it
to
lucien
said
lousteau
hector
and
vernou
will
write
articles
in
their
papers
at
the
same
gentlemen
we
shall
meet
each
other
face
to
face
at
barbin
s
said
finot
laughing
lucien
received
some
congratulations
on
his
admission
to
the
mighty
army
of
journalists
and
lousteau
explained
that
they
could
be
sure
of
him
lucien
wants
you
all
to
sup
in
a
body
at
the
house
of
the
fair
coralie
is
going
on
at
the
gymnase
said
lucien
very
well
gentlemen
it
is
understood
that
we
push
coralie
eh
put
a
few
lines
about
her
new
engagement
in
your
papers
and
say
something
about
her
talent
credit
the
management
of
the
gymnase
with
tack
and
discernment
will
it
do
to
say
intelligence
yes
say
intelligence
said
merlin
frederic
has
something
of
scribe
oh
well
then
the
manager
of
the
gymnase
is
the
most
perspicacious
and
of
men
of
business
said
vernou
look
here
don
t
write
your
articles
on
nathan
until
we
have
come
to
an
understanding
you
shall
hear
why
said
etienne
lousteau
we
ought
to
do
something
for
our
new
comrade
lucien
here
has
two
books
to
bring
out
a
volume
of
sonnets
and
a
novel
the
power
of
the
paragraph
should
make
him
a
great
poet
due
in
three
months
and
we
will
make
use
of
his
sonnets
is
the
title
to
run
down
odes
ballads
and
reveries
and
all
the
romantic
it
would
be
a
droll
thing
if
the
sonnets
were
no
good
after
all
said
what
do
you
yourself
think
of
your
sonnets
lucien
yes
what
do
you
think
of
them
asked
one
of
the
two
whom
lucien
did
not
know
they
are
all
right
gentlemen
i
give
you
my
word
said
lousteau
very
well
that
will
do
for
me
said
vernou
i
will
heave
your
book
at
the
poets
of
the
sacristy
i
am
tired
of
if
dauriat
declines
to
take
the
this
evening
we
will
attack
him
by
pitching
into
but
what
will
nathan
say
cried
lucien
his
five
colleagues
burst
out
laughing
oh
he
will
be
delighted
said
vernou
you
will
see
how
we
manage
these
so
he
is
one
of
us
said
one
of
the
two
journalists
yes
yes
frederic
no
we
are
all
working
for
you
lucien
you
see
you
must
stand
by
us
when
your
turn
comes
we
are
all
friends
of
nathan
s
and
we
are
attacking
him
now
let
us
divide
alexander
s
frederic
will
you
take
the
francais
and
the
odeon
if
these
gentlemen
are
willing
returned
the
person
addressed
as
frederic
the
others
nodded
assent
but
lucien
saw
a
gleam
of
jealousy
here
and
there
i
am
keeping
the
opera
the
italiens
and
the
put
in
vernou
and
how
about
me
am
i
to
have
no
theatres
at
all
asked
the
second
stranger
oh
well
hector
can
let
you
have
the
varietes
and
lucien
can
spare
you
the
porte
let
him
have
the
porte
lucien
he
is
wild
about
fanny
beaupre
and
you
can
take
the
in
exchange
i
shall
have
bobino
and
the
funambules
and
madame
saqui
now
what
have
we
for
nothing
gentlemen
be
brilliant
for
my
first
number
the
baron
du
chatelet
and
his
cuttlefish
bone
will
not
last
for
a
week
and
the
writer
of
is
worn
and
is
stale
too
said
vernou
everybody
has
taken
it
the
fact
is
we
want
a
new
set
of
ninepins
said
frederic
suppose
that
we
take
the
virtuous
representatives
of
the
right
suggested
lousteau
we
might
say
that
de
bonald
has
sweaty
let
us
begin
a
series
of
sketches
of
ministerialist
orators
suggested
hector
merlin
you
do
that
youngster
you
know
them
they
are
your
own
party
said
lousteau
you
could
indulge
any
little
private
grudges
of
your
own
pitch
into
beugnot
and
syrieys
de
mayrinhac
and
the
rest
you
might
have
the
sketches
ready
in
advance
and
we
shall
have
something
to
fall
back
how
if
we
invented
one
or
two
cases
of
refusal
of
burial
with
aggravating
circumstances
asked
hector
do
not
follow
in
the
tracks
of
the
big
constitutional
papers
they
have
full
of
ecclesiastical
retorted
vernou
repeated
lucien
that
is
our
word
for
a
scrap
of
fiction
told
for
true
put
in
to
enliven
the
column
of
morning
news
when
it
is
flat
we
owe
the
discovery
to
benjamin
franklin
the
inventor
of
the
lightning
conductor
and
the
republic
that
journalist
completely
deceived
the
encyclopaedists
by
his
transatlantic
raynal
gives
two
of
them
for
facts
in
his
philosophique
des
i
did
not
know
that
said
vernou
what
were
the
stories
one
was
a
tale
about
an
englishman
and
a
negress
who
helped
him
to
escape
he
sold
the
woman
for
a
slave
after
getting
her
with
child
himself
to
enhance
her
value
the
other
was
the
eloquent
defence
of
a
young
woman
brought
before
the
authorities
for
bearing
a
child
out
of
wedlock
franklin
owned
to
the
fraud
in
necker
s
house
when
he
came
to
paris
much
to
the
confusion
of
french
philosophism
behold
how
the
new
world
twice
set
a
bad
example
to
the
old
in
journalism
said
lousteau
everything
that
is
probable
is
true
that
is
an
criminal
procedure
is
based
on
the
same
rule
said
vernou
very
well
we
meet
here
at
nine
o
clock
and
with
that
they
rose
and
the
sitting
broke
up
with
the
most
affecting
demonstrations
of
intimacy
and
what
have
you
done
to
finot
lucien
that
he
should
make
a
special
arrangement
with
you
you
are
the
only
one
that
he
has
bound
to
himself
said
etienne
lousteau
as
they
came
downstairs
i
nothing
it
was
his
own
proposal
said
lucien
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
you
should
make
your
own
terms
with
him
i
should
be
delighted
we
should
both
of
us
be
the
better
for
on
the
ground
floor
they
found
finot
he
stepped
across
to
lousteau
and
asked
him
into
the
private
office
giroudeau
immediately
put
a
couple
of
stamped
agreements
before
lucien
sign
your
agreement
he
said
and
the
new
editor
will
think
the
whole
thing
was
arranged
lucien
reading
the
document
overheard
fragments
of
a
tolerably
warm
dispute
within
as
to
the
line
of
conduct
and
profits
of
the
paper
etienne
lousteau
wanted
his
share
of
the
blackmail
levied
by
giroudeau
and
in
all
probability
the
matter
was
compromised
for
the
pair
came
out
perfectly
good
friends
we
will
meet
at
dauriat
s
lucien
in
the
wooden
galleries
at
eight
o
clock
said
etienne
lousteau
a
young
man
appeared
meanwhile
in
search
of
employment
wearing
the
same
nervous
shy
look
with
which
lucien
himself
had
come
to
the
office
so
short
a
while
ago
and
in
his
secret
soul
lucien
felt
amused
as
he
watched
giroudeau
playing
off
the
same
tactics
with
which
the
old
campaigner
had
previously
foiled
him
opened
his
eyes
to
the
necessity
of
the
manoeuvres
which
raised
insurmountable
barriers
between
beginners
and
the
upper
room
where
the
elect
were
gathered
together
contributors
don
t
get
very
much
as
it
is
he
said
addressing
giroudeau
if
there
were
more
of
you
there
would
be
so
much
less
retorted
the
captain
so
there
the
old
campaigner
swung
his
loaded
cane
and
went
down
coughing
as
usual
out
in
the
street
he
was
amazed
to
see
a
handsome
carriage
waiting
on
the
boulevard
for
lucien
are
the
army
nowadays
he
said
and
we
are
the
upon
my
word
said
lucien
as
he
drove
away
with
coralie
these
young
writers
seem
to
me
to
be
the
best
fellows
alive
here
am
i
a
journalist
sure
of
making
six
hundred
francs
a
month
if
i
work
like
a
horse
but
i
shall
find
a
publisher
for
my
two
books
and
i
will
write
others
for
my
friends
will
insure
a
success
and
so
coralie
le
as
you
you
will
make
your
way
dear
boy
but
you
must
not
be
as
as
you
are
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
you
be
that
is
the
proper
coralie
and
lucien
drove
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
again
they
met
the
marquise
d
espard
mme
de
bargeton
and
the
baron
du
chatelet
mme
de
bargeton
gave
lucien
a
languishing
glance
which
might
be
taken
as
a
greeting
camusot
had
ordered
the
best
possible
dinner
and
coralie
feeling
that
she
was
rid
of
her
adorer
was
more
charming
to
the
poor
than
she
had
ever
been
in
the
fourteen
months
during
which
their
connection
lasted
he
had
never
seen
her
so
kindly
so
enchantingly
lovely
come
he
thought
let
us
keep
near
her
anyhow
in
consequence
camusot
made
secret
overtures
he
promised
coralie
an
income
of
six
thousand
livres
he
would
transfer
the
stock
in
the
funds
into
her
name
his
wife
knew
nothing
about
the
investment
if
only
she
would
consent
to
be
his
mistress
still
he
would
shut
his
eyes
to
her
lover
and
betray
such
an
angel
why
just
look
at
him
you
old
fossil
and
look
at
yourself
and
her
eyes
turned
to
her
poet
camusot
had
pressed
lucien
to
drink
till
the
poet
s
head
was
rather
cloudy
there
was
no
help
for
it
camusot
made
up
his
mind
to
wait
till
sheer
want
should
give
him
this
woman
a
second
time
then
i
can
only
be
your
friend
he
said
as
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
lucien
went
from
coralie
and
camusot
to
the
wooden
galleries
what
a
change
had
been
wrought
in
his
mind
by
his
initiation
into
journalism
he
mixed
fearlessly
now
with
the
crowd
which
surged
to
and
fro
in
the
buildings
he
even
swaggered
a
little
because
he
had
a
mistress
and
he
walked
into
dauriat
s
shop
in
an
offhand
manner
because
he
was
a
journalist
he
found
himself
among
distinguished
men
gave
a
hand
to
blondet
and
nathan
and
finot
and
to
all
the
coterie
with
whom
he
had
been
fraternizing
for
a
week
he
was
a
personage
he
thought
and
he
flattered
himself
that
he
surpassed
his
comrades
that
little
flick
of
the
wine
did
him
admirable
service
he
was
witty
he
showed
that
he
could
howl
with
the
and
yet
the
tacit
approval
the
praises
spoken
and
unspoken
on
which
he
had
counted
were
not
forthcoming
he
noticed
the
first
stirrings
of
jealousy
among
a
group
less
curious
perhaps
than
anxious
to
know
the
place
which
this
newcomer
might
take
and
the
exact
portion
of
the
of
profits
which
he
would
probably
secure
and
swallow
lucien
only
saw
smiles
on
two
faces
finot
who
regarded
him
as
a
mine
to
be
exploited
and
lousteau
who
considered
that
he
had
proprietary
rights
in
the
poet
looked
glad
to
see
him
lousteau
had
begun
already
to
assume
the
airs
of
an
editor
he
tapped
sharply
on
the
of
dauriat
s
private
office
one
moment
my
friend
cried
a
voice
within
as
the
publisher
s
face
appeared
above
the
green
curtains
the
moment
lasted
an
hour
and
finally
lucien
and
etienne
were
admitted
into
the
sanctum
well
have
you
thought
over
our
friend
s
proposal
asked
etienne
lousteau
now
an
editor
to
be
sure
said
dauriat
lolling
like
a
sultan
in
his
chair
i
have
read
the
volume
and
i
submitted
it
to
a
man
of
taste
a
good
judge
for
i
don
t
pretend
to
understand
these
things
myself
i
myself
my
friend
buy
reputations
as
the
englishman
bought
his
love
you
are
as
great
as
a
poet
as
you
are
handsome
as
a
man
my
boy
pronounced
dauriat
upon
my
word
and
honor
i
don
t
tell
you
that
as
a
publisher
mind
your
sonnets
are
magnificent
no
sign
of
effort
about
them
as
is
natural
when
a
man
writes
with
inspiration
and
verve
you
know
your
craft
in
fact
one
of
the
good
points
of
the
new
school
your
volume
of
is
a
fine
book
but
there
is
no
business
in
it
and
it
is
not
worth
my
while
to
meddle
with
anything
but
a
very
big
affair
in
conscience
i
won
t
take
your
sonnets
it
would
be
impossible
to
push
them
there
is
not
enough
in
the
thing
to
pay
the
expenses
of
a
big
success
you
will
not
keep
to
poetry
besides
this
book
of
yours
will
be
your
first
and
last
attempt
of
the
kind
you
are
young
you
bring
me
the
everlasting
volume
of
early
verse
which
every
man
of
letters
writes
when
he
leaves
school
he
thinks
a
lot
of
it
at
the
time
and
laughs
at
it
later
on
lousteau
your
friend
has
a
poem
put
away
somewhere
among
his
old
socks
i
ll
warrant
haven
t
you
a
poem
that
you
thought
a
good
deal
of
once
lousteau
inquired
dauriat
with
a
knowing
glance
at
the
other
how
should
i
be
writing
prose
otherwise
eh
asked
lousteau
there
you
see
he
has
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
it
for
our
friend
understands
business
and
the
trade
continued
dauriat
for
me
the
question
is
not
whether
you
are
a
great
poet
i
know
that
he
added
stroking
down
lucien
s
pride
you
have
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
of
merit
if
i
were
only
just
starting
in
business
i
should
make
the
mistake
of
publishing
your
book
but
in
the
first
place
my
sleeping
partners
and
those
at
the
back
of
me
are
cutting
off
my
supplies
i
dropped
twenty
thousand
francs
over
poetry
last
year
and
that
is
enough
for
them
they
will
not
hear
of
any
more
just
now
and
they
are
my
masters
nevertheless
that
is
not
the
question
i
admit
that
you
may
be
a
great
poet
but
will
you
be
a
prolific
writer
will
you
hatch
sonnets
regularly
will
you
run
into
ten
volumes
is
there
business
in
it
of
course
not
you
will
be
a
delightful
prose
writer
you
have
too
much
sense
to
spoil
your
style
with
tagging
rhymes
together
you
have
a
chance
to
make
thirty
thousand
francs
per
annum
by
writing
for
the
papers
and
you
will
not
exchange
that
chance
for
three
thousand
francs
made
with
difficulty
by
your
hemistiches
and
strophes
and
tomfoolery
you
know
that
he
is
on
the
paper
dauriat
put
in
lousteau
yes
dauriat
answered
yes
i
saw
his
article
and
in
his
own
interests
i
decline
the
yes
sir
in
six
months
time
i
shall
have
paid
you
more
money
for
the
articles
that
i
shall
ask
you
to
write
than
for
your
poetry
that
will
not
and
fame
said
lucien
dauriat
and
lousteau
laughed
oh
dear
said
lousteau
there
be
illusions
fame
means
ten
years
of
sticking
to
work
and
a
hundred
thousand
francs
lost
or
made
in
the
publishing
trade
if
you
find
anybody
mad
enough
to
print
your
poetry
for
you
you
will
feel
some
respect
for
me
in
another
twelvemonth
when
you
have
had
time
to
see
the
outcome
of
the
have
you
the
manuscript
here
lucien
asked
coldly
here
it
is
my
friend
said
dauriat
the
publisher
s
manner
towards
lucien
had
sweetened
singularly
lucien
took
up
the
roll
without
looking
at
the
string
so
sure
he
felt
that
dauriat
had
read
his
he
went
out
with
lousteau
seemingly
neither
disconcerted
nor
dissatisfied
dauriat
went
with
them
into
the
shop
talking
of
his
newspaper
and
lousteau
s
daily
while
lucien
played
with
the
manuscript
of
the
do
you
suppose
that
dauriat
has
read
your
sonnets
or
sent
them
to
any
one
else
etienne
lousteau
snatched
an
opportunity
to
whisper
yes
said
lucien
look
at
the
lucien
looked
down
at
the
blot
of
ink
and
saw
that
the
mark
on
the
string
still
coincided
he
turned
white
with
rage
which
of
the
sonnets
was
it
that
you
particularly
liked
he
asked
turning
to
the
publisher
they
are
all
of
them
remarkable
my
friend
but
the
sonnet
on
the
is
delightful
the
closing
thought
is
fine
and
exquisitely
expressed
i
felt
sure
from
that
sonnet
that
your
prose
work
would
command
a
success
and
i
spoke
to
finot
about
you
at
once
write
articles
for
us
and
we
will
pay
you
well
for
them
fame
is
a
very
fine
thing
you
see
but
don
t
forget
the
practical
and
solid
and
take
every
chance
that
turns
up
when
you
have
made
money
you
can
write
the
poet
dashed
out
of
the
shop
to
avoid
an
explosion
he
was
furious
lousteau
followed
well
my
boy
pray
keep
cool
take
men
as
they
are
for
means
to
an
end
do
you
wish
for
revenge
at
any
price
muttered
the
poet
here
is
a
copy
of
nathan
s
book
dauriat
has
just
given
it
to
me
the
second
edition
is
coming
out
read
the
book
again
and
knock
off
an
article
demolishing
it
felicien
vernou
can
not
endure
nathan
for
he
thinks
that
nathan
s
success
will
injure
his
own
forthcoming
book
it
is
a
craze
with
these
little
minds
to
fancy
that
there
is
not
room
for
two
successes
under
the
sun
so
he
will
see
that
your
article
finds
a
place
in
the
big
paper
for
which
he
but
what
is
there
to
be
said
against
the
book
it
is
good
work
cried
lucien
oh
i
say
you
must
learn
your
trade
said
lousteau
laughing
given
that
the
book
was
a
masterpiece
under
the
stroke
of
your
pen
it
must
turn
to
dull
trash
dangerous
and
unwholesome
but
how
you
turn
all
the
good
points
into
bad
i
am
incapable
of
such
a
juggler
s
my
dear
boy
a
journalist
is
a
juggler
a
man
must
make
up
his
mind
to
the
drawbacks
of
the
calling
look
here
i
am
not
a
bad
fellow
this
is
the
way
should
set
to
work
myself
attention
you
might
begin
by
praising
the
book
and
amuse
yourself
a
while
by
saying
what
you
really
think
good
says
the
reader
this
critic
is
not
jealous
he
will
be
impartial
no
doubt
and
from
that
point
your
public
will
think
that
your
criticism
is
a
piece
of
conscientious
work
then
when
you
have
won
your
reader
s
confidence
you
will
regret
that
you
must
blame
the
tendency
and
influence
of
such
work
upon
french
literature
does
not
france
you
will
say
sway
the
whole
intellectual
world
french
writers
have
kept
europe
in
the
path
of
analysis
and
philosophical
criticism
from
age
to
age
by
their
powerful
style
and
the
original
turn
given
by
them
to
here
for
the
benefit
of
the
philistine
insert
a
panegyric
on
voltaire
rousseau
diderot
montesquieu
and
buffon
hold
forth
upon
the
inexorable
french
language
show
how
it
spreads
a
varnish
as
it
were
over
thought
let
fall
a
few
aphorisms
such
as
a
great
writer
in
france
is
invariably
a
great
man
he
writes
in
a
language
which
compels
him
to
think
it
is
otherwise
in
other
countries
and
so
on
and
so
on
then
to
prove
your
case
draw
a
comparison
between
rabener
the
german
satirical
moralist
and
la
bruyere
nothing
gives
a
critic
such
an
air
as
an
apparent
familiarity
with
foreign
literature
kant
is
cousin
s
pedestal
once
on
that
ground
you
bring
out
a
word
which
sums
up
the
french
men
of
genius
of
the
eighteenth
century
for
the
benefit
of
simpletons
you
call
that
literature
the
literature
of
armed
with
this
expression
you
fling
all
the
mighty
dead
at
the
heads
of
the
illustrious
living
you
explain
that
in
the
present
day
a
new
form
of
literature
has
sprung
up
that
dialogue
the
easiest
form
of
writing
is
overdone
and
description
dispenses
with
any
need
for
thinking
on
the
part
of
the
author
or
reader
you
bring
up
the
fiction
of
voltaire
diderot
sterne
and
le
sage
so
trenchant
so
compact
of
the
stuff
of
life
and
turn
from
them
to
the
modern
novel
composed
of
scenery
and
and
metaphor
and
the
dramatic
situations
of
which
scott
is
full
invention
may
be
displayed
in
such
work
but
there
is
no
room
for
anything
else
the
romance
after
the
manner
of
scott
is
a
mere
passing
fashion
in
literature
you
will
say
and
fulminate
against
the
fatal
way
in
which
ideas
are
diluted
and
beaten
thin
cry
out
against
a
style
within
the
reach
of
any
intellect
for
any
one
can
commence
author
at
small
expense
in
a
way
of
literature
which
you
can
nickname
the
literature
of
then
you
fall
upon
nathan
with
your
argument
and
establish
it
beyound
cavil
that
he
is
a
mere
imitator
with
an
appearance
of
genius
the
concise
grand
style
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
lacking
you
show
that
the
author
substitutes
events
for
sentiments
action
and
stir
is
not
life
he
gives
you
pictures
but
no
ideas
come
out
with
such
phrases
and
people
will
take
them
in
spite
of
the
merits
of
the
work
it
seems
to
you
to
be
a
dangerous
nay
a
fatal
precedent
it
throws
open
the
gates
of
the
temple
of
fame
to
the
crowd
and
in
the
distance
you
descry
a
legion
of
petty
authors
hastening
to
imitate
this
novel
and
easy
style
of
writing
here
you
launch
out
into
resounding
lamentations
over
the
decadence
and
decline
of
taste
and
slip
in
eulogies
of
messieurs
etienne
jouy
tissot
gosse
duval
jay
benjamin
constant
aignan
villemain
and
the
whole
chorus
who
patronize
vernou
s
paper
next
you
draw
a
picture
of
that
glorious
phalanx
of
writers
repelling
the
invasion
of
the
romantics
these
are
the
upholders
of
ideas
and
style
as
against
metaphor
and
balderdash
the
modern
representatives
of
the
school
of
voltaire
as
opposed
to
the
english
and
german
schools
even
as
the
seventeen
heroic
deputies
of
the
left
fought
the
battle
for
the
nation
against
the
ultras
of
the
right
and
then
under
cover
of
names
respected
by
the
immense
majority
of
frenchmen
who
will
always
be
against
the
government
you
can
crush
nathan
for
although
his
work
is
far
above
the
average
it
confirms
the
bourgeois
taste
for
literature
without
ideas
and
after
that
you
understand
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
nathan
and
his
book
but
of
france
and
the
glory
of
france
it
is
the
duty
of
all
honest
and
courageous
pens
to
make
strenuous
opposition
to
these
foreign
importations
and
with
that
you
flatter
your
readers
shrewd
french
is
not
easily
caught
napping
if
publishers
by
ways
which
you
do
not
choose
to
specify
have
stolen
a
success
the
reading
public
very
soon
judges
for
itself
and
corrects
the
mistakes
made
by
some
five
hundred
fools
who
always
rush
to
the
fore
say
that
the
publisher
who
sold
a
first
edition
of
the
book
is
audacious
indeed
to
issue
a
second
and
express
regret
that
so
clever
a
man
does
not
know
the
taste
of
the
country
better
there
is
the
gist
of
it
just
a
sprinkle
of
the
salt
of
wit
and
a
dash
of
vinegar
to
bring
out
the
flavor
and
dauriat
will
be
done
to
a
turn
but
mind
that
you
end
with
seeming
to
pity
nathan
for
a
mistake
and
speak
of
him
as
of
a
man
from
whom
contemporary
literature
may
look
for
great
things
if
he
renounces
these
lucien
was
amazed
at
this
talk
from
lousteau
as
the
journalist
spoke
the
scales
fell
from
his
eyes
he
beheld
new
truths
of
which
he
had
never
before
caught
so
much
as
a
glimpse
but
all
this
that
you
are
saying
is
quite
true
and
just
said
he
if
it
were
not
how
could
you
make
it
tell
against
nathan
s
book
asked
lousteau
that
is
the
first
manner
of
demolishing
a
book
my
boy
it
is
the
pickaxe
style
of
criticism
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
ways
your
education
will
complete
itself
in
time
when
you
are
absolutely
obliged
to
speak
of
a
man
whom
you
do
not
like
for
proprietors
and
editors
are
sometimes
under
compulsion
you
bring
out
a
neutral
special
article
you
put
the
title
of
the
book
at
the
head
of
it
and
begin
with
general
remarks
on
the
greeks
and
the
romans
if
you
like
and
wind
up
with
and
this
brings
us
to
s
book
which
will
form
the
subject
of
a
second
the
second
article
never
appears
and
in
this
way
you
snuff
out
the
book
between
two
promises
but
in
this
case
you
are
writing
down
not
nathan
but
dauriat
he
needs
the
pickaxe
style
if
the
book
is
really
good
the
pickaxe
does
no
harm
but
it
goes
to
the
core
of
it
if
it
is
bad
in
the
first
case
no
one
but
the
publisher
is
any
the
worse
in
the
second
you
do
the
public
a
service
both
methods
moreover
are
equally
serviceable
in
political
etienne
lousteau
s
cruel
lesson
opened
up
possibilities
for
lucien
s
imagination
he
understood
this
craft
to
admiration
let
us
go
to
the
office
said
lousteau
we
shall
find
our
friends
there
and
we
will
agree
among
ourselves
to
charge
at
nathan
they
will
laugh
you
will
arrived
in
the
rue
they
went
up
to
the
room
in
the
roof
where
the
paper
was
made
up
and
lucien
was
surprised
and
gratified
no
less
to
see
the
alacrity
with
which
his
comrades
proceeded
to
demolish
nathan
s
book
hector
merlin
took
up
a
piece
of
paper
and
wrote
a
few
lines
for
his
own
a
second
edition
of
nathan
s
book
is
announced
we
had
intended
to
keep
silence
with
regard
to
that
work
but
its
apparent
success
obliges
us
to
publish
an
article
not
so
much
upon
the
book
itself
as
upon
certain
tendencies
of
the
new
school
of
at
the
head
of
the
facetiae
in
the
morning
s
paper
lousteau
inserted
the
following
note
m
dauriat
is
bringing
out
a
second
edition
of
nathan
s
book
evidently
he
does
not
know
the
legal
maxim
bis
in
all
honor
to
rash
lousteau
s
words
had
been
like
a
torch
for
burning
lucien
s
hot
desire
to
be
revenged
on
dauriat
took
the
place
of
conscience
and
inspiration
for
three
days
he
never
left
coralie
s
room
he
sat
at
work
by
the
fire
waited
upon
by
berenice
petted
in
moments
of
weariness
by
the
silent
and
attentive
coralie
till
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
had
made
a
fair
copy
of
about
three
columns
of
criticism
and
an
astonishingly
good
piece
of
work
it
was
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
when
he
ran
round
to
the
office
found
his
associates
and
read
over
his
work
to
an
attentive
audience
felicien
said
not
a
syllable
he
took
up
the
manuscript
and
made
off
with
it
down
the
staircase
what
has
come
to
him
cried
lucien
he
has
taken
your
article
straight
to
the
printer
said
hector
merlin
tis
a
masterpiece
not
a
line
to
add
nor
a
word
to
take
there
was
no
need
to
do
more
than
show
you
the
way
said
lousteau
i
should
like
to
see
nathan
s
face
when
he
reads
this
said
another
contributor
beaming
with
gentle
satisfaction
it
is
as
well
to
have
you
for
a
friend
remarked
hector
merlin
then
it
will
do
lucien
asked
quickly
blondet
and
vignon
will
feel
bad
said
lousteau
here
is
a
short
article
which
i
have
knocked
together
for
you
began
lucien
if
it
takes
i
could
write
you
a
read
it
over
said
lousteau
and
lucien
read
the
first
of
the
delightful
short
papers
which
made
the
fortune
of
the
little
newspaper
a
series
of
sketches
of
paris
life
a
portrait
a
type
an
ordinary
event
or
some
of
the
oddities
of
the
great
city
this
specimen
the
man
in
the
street
was
written
in
a
way
that
was
fresh
and
original
the
thoughts
were
struck
out
by
the
shock
of
the
words
the
sounding
ring
of
the
adverbs
and
adjectives
caught
the

paper

as
different
from

serious
and
profound
article
on
nathan

des

sort
of
thing

merlin

is
furious
about
those
two
bombshells
hurled
into
his
magazine
i
have
just
come
from
him
he
was
hurling
imprecations
and
in
such
a
rage

he
had
sold
his
paper

took
him
aside
and

word
in
his
ear

man
of
talent

arms

the
dauriat

dumfounded
by
the
article
on
nathan
said
lousteau
do
you
see
now
what
journalism
is
lucien
your
revenge
is
beginning
to
tell
the
baron
chatelet
came
here
this
morning
for
your
address
there
was
a
cutting
article
upon
him
in
this
morning
s
issue
he
is
a
weakling
that
buck
of
the
empire
and
he
has
lost
his
head
have
you
seen
the
paper
it
is
a
funny
article
look
funeral
of
the
heron
and
the
s
mme
de
bargeton
is
called
the
now
and
no
mistake
and
chatelet
is
known
everywhere
as
baron
lucien
took
up
the
paper
and
could
not
help
laughing
at
vernou
s
extremely
clever
skit
they
will
capitulate
soon
said
hector
merlin
lucien
merrily
assisted
at
the
manufacture
of
epigrams
and
jokes
at
the
end
of
the
paper
and
the
associates
smoked
and
chatted
over
the
day
s
adventures
over
the
foibles
of
some
among
their
number
or
some
new
bit
of
personal
gossip
from
their
witty
malicious
bantering
talk
lucien
gained
a
knowledge
of
the
inner
life
of
literature
and
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
craft
while
they
are
setting
up
the
paper
i
will
go
round
with
you
and
introduce
you
to
the
managers
of
your
theatres
and
take
you
behind
the
scenes
said
lousteau
and
then
we
will
go
to
the
and
have
a
frolic
in
their
they
went
from
theatre
to
theatre
lucien
was
introduced
to
this
one
and
that
and
enthroned
as
a
dramatic
critic
managers
complimented
him
actresses
flung
him
side
glances
for
every
one
of
them
knew
that
this
was
the
critic
who
by
a
single
article
had
gained
an
engagement
at
the
gymnase
with
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
for
coralie
and
another
for
florine
at
the
with
eight
thousand
francs
lucien
was
a
man
of
importance
the
little
ovations
raised
lucien
in
his
own
eyes
and
taught
him
to
know
his
power
at
eleven
o
clock
the
pair
arrived
at
the
lucien
with
a
careless
air
that
worked
wonders
nathan
was
there
nathan
held
out
a
hand
which
lucien
squeezed
ah
my
masters
so
you
have
a
mind
to
floor
me
have
you
said
nathan
looking
from
one
to
the
other
just
you
wait
till
my
dear
fellow
and
you
shall
see
how
lucien
has
taken
you
in
hand
upon
my
word
you
will
be
pleased
a
piece
of
serious
criticism
like
that
is
sure
to
do
a
book
lucien
reddened
with
confusion
is
it
severe
inquired
nathan
it
is
serious
said
lousteau
then
there
is
no
harm
done
nathan
rejoined
hector
merlin
in
the
greenroom
of
the
vaudeville
was
saying
that
i
had
been
cut
let
him
talk
and
wait
cried
lucien
and
took
refuge
in
coralie
s
coralie
in
her
alluring
costume
had
just
come
off
the
stage
next
morning
as
lucien
and
coralie
sat
at
breakfast
a
carriage
drove
along
the
rue
de
vendome
the
street
was
quiet
enough
so
that
they
could
hear
the
light
sound
made
by
an
elegant
cabriolet
and
there
was
that
in
the
pace
of
the
horse
and
the
manner
of
pulling
up
at
the
door
which
tells
unmistakably
of
a
thoroughbred
lucien
went
to
the
window
and
there
in
fact
beheld
a
splendid
english
horse
and
no
less
a
person
than
dauriat
flinging
the
reins
to
his
man
as
he
stepped
down
tis
the
publisher
coralie
said
lucien
let
him
wait
berenice
coralie
said
at
once
lucien
smiled
at
her
presence
of
mind
and
kissed
her
with
a
great
rush
of
tenderness
this
mere
girl
had
made
his
interests
hers
in
a
wonderful
way
she
was
where
he
was
concerned
the
apparition
of
the
insolent
publisher
the
sudden
and
complete
collapse
of
that
prince
of
charlatans
was
due
to
circumstances
almost
entirely
forgotten
so
utterly
has
the
book
trade
changed
during
the
last
fifteen
years
from
to
when
newspaper
were
only
just
beginning
to
lend
new
books
the
fiscal
law
pressed
more
heavily
than
ever
upon
periodical
publications
and
necessity
created
the
invention
of
advertisements
paragraphs
and
articles
in
the
newspapers
were
the
only
means
of
advertisement
known
in
those
days
and
french
newspapers
before
the
year
were
so
small
that
the
largest
sheet
of
those
times
was
not
so
large
as
the
smallest
daily
paper
of
ours
dauriat
and
ladvocat
the
first
publishers
to
make
a
stand
against
the
tyranny
of
journalists
were
also
the
first
to
use
the
placards
which
caught
the
attention
of
paris
by
strange
type
striking
colors
vignettes
and
at
a
later
time
by
lithograph
illustrations
till
a
placard
became
a
for
the
eyes
and
not
unfrequently
a
snare
for
the
purse
of
the
amateur
so
much
originality
indeed
was
expended
on
placards
in
paris
that
one
of
that
peculiar
kind
of
maniacs
known
as
a
collector
possesses
a
complete
series
at
first
the
placard
was
confined
to
the
and
stalls
upon
the
boulevards
in
paris
afterwards
it
spread
all
over
france
till
it
was
supplanted
to
some
extent
by
a
return
to
advertisements
in
the
newspapers
but
the
placard
nevertheless
which
continues
to
strike
the
eye
after
the
advertisement
and
the
book
which
is
advertised
are
both
forgotten
will
always
be
among
us
it
took
a
new
lease
of
life
when
walls
were
plastered
with
posters
newspaper
advertising
the
offspring
of
heavy
stamp
duties
a
high
rate
of
postage
and
the
heavy
deposits
of
required
by
the
government
as
security
for
good
behavior
is
within
the
reach
of
all
who
care
to
pay
for
it
and
has
turned
the
fourth
page
of
every
journal
into
a
harvest
field
alike
for
the
speculator
and
the
inland
revenue
department
the
press
restrictions
were
invented
in
the
time
of
de
villele
who
had
a
chance
if
he
had
but
known
it
of
destroying
the
power
of
journalism
by
allowing
newspapers
to
multiply
till
no
one
took
any
notice
of
them
but
he
missed
his
opportunity
and
a
sort
of
privilege
was
created
as
it
were
by
the
almost
insuperable
difficulties
put
in
the
way
of
starting
a
new
venture
so
in
the
periodical
press
might
be
said
to
have
power
of
life
and
death
over
the
creations
of
the
brain
and
the
publishing
trade
a
few
lines
among
the
items
of
news
cost
a
fearful
amount
intrigues
were
multiplied
in
newspaper
offices
and
of
a
night
when
the
columns
were
divided
up
and
this
or
that
article
was
put
in
or
left
out
to
suit
the
space
the
became
a
sort
of
battlefield
so
much
so
that
the
largest
publishing
firms
had
writers
in
their
pay
to
insert
short
articles
in
which
many
ideas
are
put
in
little
space
obscure
journalists
of
this
stamp
were
only
paid
after
the
insertion
of
the
items
and
not
unfrequently
spent
the
night
in
the
to
make
sure
that
their
contributions
were
not
omitted
sometimes
putting
in
a
long
article
obtained
heaven
knows
how
sometimes
a
few
lines
of
a
puff
the
manners
and
customs
of
journalism
and
of
the
publishing
houses
have
since
changed
so
much
that
many
people
nowadays
will
not
believe
what
immense
efforts
were
made
by
writers
and
publishers
of
books
to
secure
a
newspaper
puff
the
martyrs
of
glory
and
all
those
who
are
condemned
to
the
penal
servitude
of
a
success
were
reduced
to
such
shifts
and
stooped
to
depths
of
bribery
and
corruption
as
seem
fabulous
every
kind
of
persuasion
was
brought
to
bear
on
journalists
dinners
flattery
and
presents
the
following
story
will
throw
more
light
on
the
close
connection
between
the
critic
and
the
publisher
than
any
quantity
of
flat
assertions
there
was
once
upon
a
time
an
editor
of
an
important
paper
a
clever
writer
with
a
prospect
of
becoming
a
statesman
he
was
young
in
those
days
and
fond
of
pleasure
and
he
became
the
favorite
of
a
publishing
house
one
sunday
the
wealthy
head
of
the
firm
was
entertaining
several
of
the
foremost
journalists
of
the
time
in
the
country
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
then
a
young
and
pretty
woman
went
to
walk
in
her
park
with
the
illustrious
visitor
the
of
the
firm
a
cool
steady
methodical
german
with
nothing
but
business
in
his
head
was
discussing
a
project
with
one
of
the
journalists
and
as
they
chatted
they
walked
on
into
the
woods
beyond
the
park
in
among
the
thickets
the
german
thought
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
hostess
put
up
his
eyeglass
made
a
sign
to
his
young
companion
to
be
silent
and
turned
back
stepping
what
did
you
see
asked
the
nothing
particular
said
the
clerk
our
affair
of
the
long
article
is
settled
we
shall
have
at
least
three
columns
in
the
another
anecdote
will
show
the
influence
of
a
single
article
a
book
of
de
chateaubriand
s
on
the
last
of
the
stuarts
was
for
some
time
a
nightingale
on
the
bookseller
s
shelves
a
single
article
in
the
des
sold
the
work
in
a
week
in
those
days
when
there
were
no
lending
libraries
a
publisher
would
sell
an
edition
of
ten
thousand
copies
of
a
book
by
a
liberal
if
it
was
well
reviewed
by
the
opposition
papers
but
then
the
belgian
pirated
editions
were
not
as
yet
the
preparatory
attacks
made
by
lucien
s
friends
followed
up
by
his
article
on
nathan
proved
efficacious
they
stopped
the
sale
of
his
book
nathan
escaped
with
the
mortification
he
had
been
paid
he
had
nothing
to
lose
but
dauriat
was
like
to
lose
thirty
thousand
francs
the
trade
in
new
books
may
in
fact
be
summed
up
much
on
this
wise
a
ream
of
blank
paper
costs
fifteen
francs
a
ream
of
printed
paper
is
worth
anything
between
a
hundred
sous
and
a
hundred
crowns
according
to
its
success
a
favorable
or
unfavorable
review
at
a
critical
time
often
decides
the
question
and
dauriat
having
five
hundred
reams
of
printed
paper
on
hand
hurried
to
make
terms
with
lucien
the
sultan
was
now
the
slave
after
waiting
for
some
time
fidgeting
and
making
as
much
noise
as
he
could
while
parleying
with
berenice
he
at
last
obtained
speech
of
lucien
and
arrogant
publisher
though
he
was
he
came
in
with
the
radiant
air
of
a
courtier
in
the
royal
presence
mingled
however
with
a
certain
and
easy
good
humor
don
t
disturb
yourselves
my
little
dears
how
nice
they
look
just
like
a
pair
of
who
would
think
now
mademoiselle
that
he
with
that
girl
s
face
of
his
could
be
a
tiger
with
claws
of
steel
ready
to
tear
a
reputation
to
rags
just
as
he
tears
your
wrappers
i
ll
be
bound
when
you
are
not
quick
enough
to
unfasten
them
and
he
laughed
before
he
had
finished
his
jest
my
dear
boy
he
began
sitting
down
beside
mademoiselle
i
am
dauriat
he
said
interrupting
himself
he
judged
it
expedient
to
fire
his
name
at
her
like
a
pistol
shot
for
he
considered
that
coralie
was
less
cordial
than
she
should
have
been
have
you
breakfasted
monsieur
will
you
keep
us
company
asked
coralie
why
yes
it
is
easier
to
talk
at
table
said
dauriat
besides
by
accepting
your
invitation
i
shall
have
a
right
to
expect
you
to
dine
with
my
friend
lucien
here
for
we
must
be
close
friends
now
hand
and
glove
berenice
bring
oysters
lemons
fresh
butter
and
champagne
said
coralie
you
are
too
clever
not
to
know
what
has
brought
me
here
said
dauriat
fixing
his
eyes
on
lucien
you
have
come
to
buy
my
precisely
first
of
all
let
us
lay
down
our
arms
on
both
as
he
spoke
he
took
out
a
neat
pocketbook
drew
from
it
three
bills
for
a
thousand
francs
each
and
laid
them
before
lucien
with
a
suppliant
air
is
monsieur
content
asked
he
yes
said
the
poet
a
sense
of
beatitude
for
which
no
words
exist
flooded
his
soul
at
the
sight
of
that
unhoped
wealth
he
controlled
himself
but
he
longed
to
sing
aloud
to
jump
for
joy
he
was
ready
to
believe
in
aladdin
s
lamp
and
in
enchantment
he
believed
in
his
own
genius
in
short
then
the
are
mine
continued
dauriat
but
you
will
undertake
not
to
attack
my
publications
won
t
you
the
are
yours
but
i
can
not
pledge
my
pen
it
is
at
the
service
of
my
friends
as
theirs
are
but
you
are
one
of
my
authors
now
all
my
authors
are
my
friends
so
you
won
t
spoil
my
business
without
warning
me
beforehand
so
that
i
am
prepared
will
you
i
agree
to
to
your
fame
and
dauriat
raised
his
glass
i
see
that
you
have
read
the
said
lucien
dauriat
was
not
disconcerted
my
boy
a
publisher
can
not
pay
a
greater
compliment
than
by
buying
your
unread
in
six
months
time
you
will
be
a
great
poet
you
will
be
written
up
people
are
afraid
of
you
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
selling
your
book
i
am
the
same
man
of
business
that
i
was
four
days
ago
it
is
not
i
who
have
changed
it
is
last
week
your
sonnets
were
so
many
cabbage
leaves
for
me
your
position
has
ranked
them
beside
ah
well
said
lucien
if
you
have
not
read
my
sonnets
you
have
read
my
with
the
sultan
s
pleasure
of
possessing
a
fair
mistress
and
the
certainty
of
success
he
had
grown
satirical
and
adorably
impertinent
of
late
yes
my
friend
do
you
think
i
should
have
come
here
in
such
a
hurry
but
for
that
that
terrible
article
of
yours
is
very
well
written
worse
luck
oh
you
have
a
very
great
gift
my
boy
take
my
advice
and
make
the
most
of
your
vogue
he
added
with
good
humor
which
masked
the
extreme
insolence
of
the
speech
but
have
you
yourself
a
copy
of
the
paper
have
you
seen
your
article
in
print
not
yet
said
lucien
though
this
is
the
first
long
piece
of
prose
which
i
have
published
but
hector
will
have
sent
a
copy
to
my
address
in
the
rue
here
read
cried
dauriat
copying
talma
s
gesture
in
lucien
took
the
paper
but
coralie
snatched
it
from
him
the
of
your
pen
belong
to
me
as
you
well
know
she
laughed
dauriat
was
unwontedly
and
complimentary
he
was
afraid
of
lucien
and
therefore
he
asked
him
to
a
great
dinner
which
he
was
giving
to
a
party
of
journalists
towards
the
end
of
the
week
and
coralie
was
included
in
the
invitation
he
took
the
away
with
him
when
he
went
asking
poet
to
look
in
when
he
pleased
in
the
wooden
galleries
and
the
agreement
should
be
ready
for
his
signature
dauriat
never
forgot
the
royal
airs
with
which
he
endeavored
to
overawe
superficial
observers
and
to
impress
them
with
the
notion
that
he
was
a
maecenas
rather
than
a
publisher
at
this
moment
he
left
the
three
thousand
francs
waving
away
in
lordly
fashion
the
receipt
which
lucien
offered
kissed
coralie
s
hand
and
took
his
departure
well
dear
love
would
you
have
seen
many
of
these
bits
of
paper
if
you
had
stopped
in
your
hole
in
the
rue
de
cluny
prowling
about
among
the
musty
old
books
in
the
bibliotheque
de
asked
coralie
for
she
knew
the
whole
story
of
lucien
s
life
by
this
time
those
little
friends
of
yours
in
the
rue
des
are
great
ninnies
it
seems
to
his
brothers
of
the
and
lucien
could
hear
the
verdict
and
laugh
he
had
seen
himself
in
print
he
had
just
experienced
the
ineffable
joy
of
the
author
that
first
pleasurable
thrill
of
gratified
vanity
which
comes
but
once
the
full
import
and
bearing
of
his
article
became
apparent
to
him
as
he
read
and
it
the
garb
of
print
is
to
manuscript
as
the
stage
is
to
women
it
brings
beauties
and
defects
to
light
killing
and
giving
life
the
fine
thoughts
and
the
faults
alike
stare
you
in
the
face
lucien
in
his
excitement
and
rapture
gave
not
another
thought
to
nathan
nathan
was
a
for
him
that
was
all
and
he
lucien
was
happy
exceedingly
he
thought
himself
rich
the
money
brought
by
dauriat
was
a
very
potosi
for
the
lad
who
used
to
go
about
unnoticed
through
the
streets
of
angouleme
and
down
the
steep
path
into
l
houmeau
to
postel
s
garret
where
his
whole
family
had
lived
upon
an
income
of
twelve
hundred
francs
the
pleasures
of
his
life
in
paris
must
inevitably
dim
the
memories
of
those
days
but
so
keen
were
they
that
as
yet
he
seemed
to
be
back
again
in
the
place
du
murier
he
thought
of
eve
his
beautiful
noble
sister
of
david
his
friend
and
of
his
poor
mother
and
he
sent
berenice
out
to
change
one
of
the
notes
while
she
went
he
wrote
a
few
lines
to
his
family
and
on
the
maid
s
return
he
sent
her
to
the
with
a
packet
of
five
hundred
francs
addressed
to
his
mother
he
could
not
trust
himself
he
wanted
to
sent
the
money
at
once
later
he
might
not
be
able
to
do
it
both
lucien
and
coralie
looked
upon
this
restitution
as
a
meritorious
action
coralie
put
her
arms
about
her
lover
and
kissed
him
and
thought
him
a
model
son
and
brother
she
could
not
make
enough
of
him
for
generosity
is
a
trait
of
character
which
delights
these
kindly
creatures
who
always
carry
their
hearts
in
their
hands
we
have
a
dinner
now
every
day
for
a
week
she
said
we
will
make
a
little
carnival
you
have
worked
quite
hard
coralie
fain
to
delight
in
the
beauty
of
a
man
whom
all
other
women
should
envy
her
took
lucien
back
to
staub
he
was
not
dressed
finely
enough
for
her
thence
the
lovers
went
to
drive
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
came
back
to
dine
at
mme
du
s
rastignac
bixiou
des
lupeaulx
finot
blondet
vignon
the
baron
de
nucingen
beaudenord
philippe
bridau
conti
the
great
musician
all
the
artists
and
speculators
all
the
men
who
seek
for
violent
sensations
as
a
relief
from
immense
labors
gave
lucien
a
welcome
among
them
and
lucien
had
gained
confidence
he
gave
himself
out
in
talk
as
though
he
had
not
to
live
by
his
wit
and
was
pronounced
to
be
a
clever
fellow
in
the
slang
of
the
coterie
of
oh
we
must
wait
and
see
what
he
has
in
him
said
theodore
gaillard
a
poet
patronized
by
the
court
who
thought
of
starting
a
royalist
paper
to
be
entitled
the
at
a
later
day
after
dinner
merlin
and
lucien
coralie
and
mme
du
went
to
the
opera
where
merlin
had
a
box
the
whole
party
adjourned
thither
and
lucien
triumphant
reappeared
upon
the
scene
of
his
first
serious
check
he
walked
in
the
lobby
arm
in
arm
with
merlin
and
blondet
looking
the
dandies
who
had
once
made
merry
at
his
expense
between
the
eyes
chatelet
was
under
his
feet
he
clashed
glances
with
de
marsay
vandenesse
and
manerville
the
bucks
of
that
day
and
indeed
lucien
beautiful
and
elegantly
arrayed
had
caused
a
discussion
in
the
marquise
d
espard
s
box
rastignac
had
paid
a
long
visit
and
the
marquise
and
mme
de
bargeton
put
up
their
at
coralie
did
the
sight
of
lucien
send
a
pang
of
regret
through
mme
de
bargeton
s
heart
this
thought
was
uppermost
in
the
poet
s
mind
the
longing
for
revenge
aroused
in
him
by
the
sight
of
the
corinne
of
angouleme
was
as
fierce
as
on
that
day
when
the
lady
and
her
cousin
had
cut
him
in
the
did
you
bring
an
amulet
with
you
from
the
provinces
it
was
blondet
who
made
this
inquiry
some
few
days
later
when
he
called
at
eleven
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
found
that
lucien
was
not
yet
his
good
looks
are
making
ravages
from
cellar
to
garret
high
and
low
continued
blondet
kissing
coralie
on
the
forehead
i
have
come
to
enlist
you
dear
fellow
he
continued
grasping
lucien
by
the
hand
yesterday
at
the
italiens
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
asked
me
to
bring
you
to
her
house
you
will
not
give
a
refusal
to
a
charming
woman
you
meet
people
of
the
first
fashion
if
lucien
is
nice
he
will
not
go
to
see
your
countess
put
in
coralie
what
call
is
there
for
him
to
show
his
face
in
fine
society
he
would
only
be
bored
have
you
a
vested
interest
in
him
are
you
jealous
of
fine
ladies
yes
cried
coralie
they
are
worse
than
we
how
do
you
know
that
my
pet
asked
blondet
from
their
husbands
retorted
she
you
are
forgetting
that
i
once
had
six
months
of
de
do
you
suppose
child
that
am
particularly
anxious
to
take
such
a
handsome
fellow
as
your
poet
to
mme
de
montcornet
s
house
if
you
object
let
us
consider
that
nothing
has
been
said
but
i
don
t
fancy
that
the
women
are
so
much
in
question
as
a
poor
devil
that
lucien
pilloried
in
his
newspaper
he
is
begging
for
mercy
and
peace
the
baron
du
chatelet
is
imbecile
enough
to
take
the
thing
seriously
the
marquise
d
espard
mme
de
bargeton
and
mme
de
montcornet
s
set
have
taken
up
the
heron
s
cause
and
i
have
undertaken
to
reconcile
petrarch
and
his
laura
mme
de
bargeton
and
aha
cried
lucien
the
glow
of
the
intoxication
of
revenge
throbbing
through
every
vein
aha
so
my
foot
is
on
their
necks
you
make
me
adore
my
pen
worship
my
friends
bow
down
to
the
power
of
the
press
i
have
not
written
a
single
sentence
as
yet
upon
the
heron
and
the
i
will
go
with
you
my
boy
he
cried
catching
blondet
by
the
waist
yes
i
will
go
but
first
the
couple
shall
feel
the
weight
of
for
so
light
as
it
he
flourished
the
pen
which
had
written
the
article
upon
nathan
he
cried
i
will
hurl
a
couple
of
columns
at
their
heads
then
we
shall
see
don
t
be
frightened
coralie
it
is
not
love
but
revenge
revenge
and
i
will
have
it
to
the
full
what
a
man
it
is
said
blondet
if
you
but
knew
lucien
how
rare
such
explosions
are
in
this
jaded
paris
you
might
appreciate
yourself
you
will
be
a
precious
scamp
the
actual
expression
was
a
trifle
stronger
you
are
in
a
fair
way
to
be
a
power
in
the
he
will
get
on
said
coralie
well
he
has
come
a
good
way
already
in
six
and
if
he
should
climb
so
high
that
he
can
reach
a
sceptre
by
treading
over
a
corpse
he
shall
have
coralie
s
body
for
a
said
the
girl
you
are
a
pair
of
lovers
of
the
golden
age
said
i
congratulate
you
on
your
big
article
he
added
turning
to
lucien
there
were
a
lot
of
new
things
in
it
you
are
past
master
lousteau
called
with
hector
merlin
and
vernou
lucien
was
immensely
flattered
by
this
attention
felicien
vernou
brought
a
hundred
francs
for
lucien
s
article
it
was
felt
that
such
a
contributor
must
be
well
paid
to
attach
him
to
the
paper
coralie
looking
round
at
the
chapter
of
journalists
ordered
in
a
breakfast
from
the
the
nearest
restaurant
and
asked
her
visitors
to
adjourn
to
her
handsomely
furnished
when
berenice
announced
that
the
meal
was
ready
in
the
middle
of
the
repast
when
the
champagne
had
gone
to
all
heads
the
motive
of
the
visit
came
out
you
do
not
mean
to
make
an
enemy
of
nathan
do
you
asked
lousteau
nathan
is
a
journalist
and
he
has
friends
he
might
play
you
an
ugly
trick
with
your
first
book
you
have
your
of
charles
to
sell
have
you
not
we
went
round
to
nathan
this
morning
he
is
in
a
terrible
way
but
you
will
set
about
another
article
and
puff
praise
in
his
what
after
my
article
against
his
book
would
you
have
me
say
began
lucien
the
whole
party
cut
him
short
with
a
shout
of
laughter
did
you
ask
him
to
supper
here
the
day
after
asked
blondet
you
article
was
not
signed
added
lousteau
felicien
not
being
quite
such
a
new
hand
as
you
are
was
careful
to
put
an
initial
c
at
the
bottom
you
can
do
that
now
with
all
your
articles
in
his
paper
which
is
pure
unadulterated
left
we
are
all
of
us
in
the
opposition
felicien
was
tactful
enough
not
to
compromise
your
future
opinions
hector
s
shop
is
right
centre
you
might
sign
your
work
on
it
with
an
if
you
cut
a
man
up
you
do
it
anonymously
if
you
praise
him
it
is
just
as
well
to
put
your
name
to
your
it
is
not
the
signatures
that
trouble
me
returned
lucien
but
i
can
not
see
anything
to
be
said
in
favor
of
the
then
did
you
really
think
as
you
wrote
asked
hector
oh
i
thought
you
were
cleverer
than
that
youngster
said
blondet
no
upon
my
word
as
i
looked
at
that
forehead
of
yours
i
credited
you
with
the
omnipotence
of
the
great
mind
the
power
of
seeing
both
sides
of
everything
in
literature
my
boy
every
idea
is
reversible
and
no
man
can
take
upon
himself
to
decide
which
is
the
right
or
wrong
side
everything
is
in
the
domain
of
thought
ideas
are
binary
janus
is
a
fable
signifying
criticism
and
the
symbol
of
genius
the
almighty
alone
is
triform
what
raises
moliere
and
corneille
above
the
rest
of
us
but
the
faculty
of
saying
one
thing
with
an
alceste
or
an
octave
and
another
with
a
philinte
or
a
cinna
rousseau
wrote
a
letter
against
dueling
in
the
heloise
and
another
in
favor
of
it
which
of
the
two
represented
his
own
opinion
will
you
venture
to
take
it
upon
yourself
to
decide
which
of
us
could
give
judgement
for
clarissa
or
lovelace
hector
or
achilles
who
was
homer
s
hero
what
did
richardson
himself
think
it
is
the
function
of
criticism
to
look
at
a
man
s
work
in
all
its
aspects
we
draw
up
our
case
in
do
you
really
stick
to
your
written
opinions
asked
vernou
with
a
satirical
expression
why
we
are
retailers
of
phrases
that
is
how
we
make
a
livelihood
when
you
try
to
do
a
good
piece
of
work
to
write
a
book
in
short
you
can
put
your
thoughts
yourself
into
it
and
cling
to
it
and
fight
for
it
but
as
for
newspaper
articles
read
and
forgotten
they
are
worth
nothing
in
my
eyes
but
the
money
that
is
paid
for
them
if
you
attach
any
importance
to
such
drivel
you
might
as
well
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
invoke
heaven
when
you
sit
down
to
write
a
tradesman
s
every
one
apparently
was
astonished
at
lucien
s
scruples
the
last
rags
of
the
boyish
conscience
were
torn
away
and
he
was
invested
with
the
of
journalism
do
you
know
what
nathan
said
by
way
of
comforting
himself
after
your
criticism
asked
lousteau
how
should
i
know
nathan
exclaimed
paragraphs
pass
away
but
a
great
work
lives
he
will
be
here
to
supper
in
two
days
and
he
will
be
sure
to
fall
flat
at
your
feet
and
kiss
your
claws
and
swear
that
you
are
a
great
that
would
be
a
funny
thing
was
lucien
s
comment
repeated
blondet
he
can
t
help
i
am
quite
willing
my
friends
said
lucien
on
whom
the
wine
had
begun
to
take
effect
but
what
am
i
to
say
oh
well
refute
yourself
in
three
good
columns
in
merlin
s
paper
we
have
been
enjoying
the
sight
of
nathan
s
wrath
we
have
just
been
telling
him
that
he
owes
us
no
little
gratitude
for
getting
up
a
hot
controversy
that
will
sell
his
second
edition
in
a
week
in
his
eyes
at
this
present
moment
you
are
a
spy
a
scoundrel
a
caitiff
wretch
the
day
after
you
will
be
a
genius
an
uncommonly
clever
fellow
one
of
plutarch
s
men
nathan
will
hug
you
and
call
you
his
best
friend
dauriat
has
been
to
see
you
you
have
your
three
thousand
francs
you
have
worked
the
trick
now
you
want
nathan
s
respect
and
esteem
nobody
ought
to
be
let
in
except
the
publisher
we
must
not
immolate
any
one
but
an
enemy
we
should
not
talk
like
this
if
it
were
a
question
of
some
outsider
some
inconvenient
person
who
had
made
a
name
for
himself
without
us
and
was
not
wanted
but
nathan
is
one
of
us
blondet
got
some
one
to
attack
him
in
the
for
the
pleasure
of
replying
in
the
for
which
reason
the
first
edition
went
off
at
my
friends
upon
my
word
and
honor
i
can
not
write
two
words
in
praise
of
that
book
you
will
have
another
hundred
francs
interrupted
merlin
nathan
will
have
brought
you
in
ten
louis
d
or
to
say
nothing
of
an
article
that
you
might
put
in
finot
s
paper
you
would
get
a
hundred
francs
for
writing
that
and
another
hundred
francs
from
dauriat
total
twenty
but
what
am
i
to
say
here
is
your
way
out
of
the
difficulty
said
blondet
after
some
thought
say
that
the
envy
that
fastens
on
all
good
work
like
wasps
on
ripe
fruit
has
attempted
to
set
its
fangs
in
this
production
the
captious
critic
trying
his
best
to
find
fault
has
been
obliged
to
invent
theories
for
that
purpose
and
has
drawn
a
distinction
between
two
kinds
of
literature
the
literature
of
ideas
and
the
literature
of
imagery
as
he
calls
them
on
the
heads
of
that
youngster
say
that
to
give
expression
to
ideas
through
imagery
is
the
highest
form
of
art
try
to
show
that
all
poetry
is
summed
up
in
that
and
lament
that
there
is
so
little
poetry
in
french
quote
foreign
criticisms
on
the
unimaginative
precision
of
our
style
and
then
extol
de
canalis
and
nathan
for
the
services
they
have
done
france
by
infusing
a
less
prosaic
spirit
into
the
language
knock
your
previous
argument
to
pieces
by
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
have
made
progress
since
the
eighteenth
century
discover
the
progress
a
beautiful
word
to
mystify
the
bourgeois
public
say
that
the
new
methods
in
literature
concentrate
all
styles
comedy
and
tragedy
description
and
dialogues
in
a
series
of
pictures
set
in
the
brilliant
frame
of
a
plot
which
holds
the
reader
s
interest
the
novel
which
demands
sentiment
style
and
imagery
is
the
greatest
creation
of
modern
days
it
is
the
successor
of
stage
comedy
grown
obsolete
with
its
restrictions
facts
and
ideas
are
all
within
the
province
of
fiction
the
intellect
of
an
incisive
moralist
like
la
bruyere
the
power
of
treating
character
as
moliere
could
treat
it
the
grand
machinery
of
a
shakespeare
together
with
the
portrayal
of
the
most
subtle
shades
of
passion
the
one
treasury
left
untouched
by
our
predecessors
for
all
this
the
modern
novel
affords
free
scope
how
far
superior
is
all
this
to
the
the
cold
analysis
to
the
eighteenth
century
the
novel
say
sententiously
is
the
epic
grown
instance
bring
mme
de
stael
up
to
support
your
argument
the
eighteenth
century
called
all
things
in
question
it
is
the
task
of
the
nineteenth
to
conclude
and
speak
the
last
word
and
the
last
word
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
been
for
realities
realities
which
live
however
and
move
passion
in
short
an
element
unknown
in
voltaire
s
philosophy
has
been
brought
into
play
here
a
diatribe
against
voltaire
and
as
for
rousseau
his
characters
are
polemics
and
systems
masquerading
julie
and
claire
are
entelechies
informing
spirit
awaiting
flesh
and
bones
you
might
slip
off
on
a
side
issue
at
this
and
say
that
we
owe
a
new
and
original
literature
to
the
peace
and
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
for
you
are
writing
for
a
right
centre
paper
scoff
at
founders
of
systems
and
cry
with
a
glow
of
fine
enthusiasm
here
are
errors
and
misleading
statements
in
abundance
in
our
contemporary
s
work
and
to
what
end
to
depreciate
a
fine
work
to
deceive
the
public
and
to
arrive
at
this
conclusion
a
book
that
sells
does
not
mind
you
put
tis
a
harmless
expletive
that
stimulates
the
reader
s
interest
foresee
the
approaching
decadence
of
criticism
in
fact
moral
there
is
but
one
kind
of
literature
the
literature
which
aims
to
please
nathan
has
started
upon
a
new
way
he
understands
his
epoch
and
fulfils
the
requirements
of
his
age
the
demand
for
drama
the
natural
demand
of
a
century
in
which
the
political
stage
has
become
a
permanent
puppet
show
have
we
not
seen
four
dramas
in
a
score
of
years
the
revolution
the
directory
the
empire
and
the
restoration
with
that
wallow
in
dithyramb
and
eulogy
and
the
second
edition
shall
vanish
like
smoke
this
is
the
way
to
do
it
next
saturday
put
a
review
in
our
magazine
and
sign
it
de
rubempre
out
in
full
in
that
final
article
say
that
fine
work
always
brings
about
abundant
controversy
this
week
such
and
such
a
paper
contained
such
and
such
an
article
on
nathan
s
book
and
such
another
paper
made
a
vigorous
then
you
criticise
the
critics
c
and
l
pay
me
a
passing
compliment
on
the
first
article
in
the
and
end
by
averring
that
nathan
s
work
is
the
great
book
of
the
epoch
which
is
all
as
if
you
said
nothing
at
all
they
say
the
same
of
everything
that
comes
out
and
so
continued
blondet
you
will
have
made
four
hundred
francs
in
a
week
to
say
nothing
of
the
pleasure
of
now
and
again
saying
what
you
really
think
a
discerning
public
will
maintain
that
either
c
or
l
or
rubempre
is
in
the
right
of
it
or
mayhap
all
the
three
mythology
beyond
doubt
one
of
the
grandest
inventions
of
the
human
brain
places
truth
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
and
what
are
we
to
do
without
buckets
you
will
have
supplied
the
public
with
three
for
one
there
you
are
my
boy
go
ahead
lucien
s
head
was
swimming
with
bewilderment
blondet
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
i
am
going
to
my
shop
said
he
and
every
man
likewise
departed
to
his
shop
for
these
a
newspaper
office
was
nothing
but
a
shop
they
were
to
meet
again
in
the
evening
at
the
wooden
galleries
and
lucien
would
sign
his
treaty
of
peace
with
dauriat
florine
and
lousteau
lucien
and
coralie
blondet
and
finot
were
to
dine
at
the
du
bruel
was
giving
the
manager
of
the
a
dinner
they
are
right
exclaimed
lucien
when
he
was
alone
with
coralie
men
are
made
to
be
tools
in
the
hands
of
stronger
spirits
four
hundred
francs
for
three
articles
doguereau
would
scarcely
give
me
as
much
for
a
book
which
cost
me
two
years
of
write
criticism
said
coralie
have
a
good
time
look
at
me
i
am
an
andalusian
girl
i
may
be
a
gypsy
and
a
man
the
night
after
do
as
i
do
give
them
grimaces
for
their
money
and
let
us
live
lucien
smitten
with
love
of
paradox
set
himself
to
mount
and
ride
that
unruly
hybrid
product
of
pegasus
and
balaam
s
ass
started
out
at
a
gallop
over
the
fields
of
thought
while
he
took
a
turn
in
the
bois
and
discovered
new
possibilities
in
blondet
s
outline
he
dined
as
happy
people
dine
and
signed
away
all
his
rights
in
the
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
any
trouble
might
arise
from
that
transaction
in
the
future
he
took
a
turn
of
work
at
the
office
wrote
off
a
couple
of
columns
and
came
back
to
the
rue
de
vendome
next
morning
he
found
the
germs
of
yesterday
s
ideas
had
sprung
up
and
developed
in
his
brain
as
ideas
develop
while
the
intellect
is
yet
unjaded
and
the
sap
is
rising
and
thoroughly
did
he
enjoy
the
projection
of
this
new
article
he
threw
himself
into
it
with
enthusiasm
at
the
summons
of
the
spirit
of
contradiction
new
charms
met
beneath
his
pen
he
was
witty
and
satirical
he
rose
to
yet
new
views
of
sentiment
of
ideas
and
imagery
in
literature
with
subtle
ingenuity
he
went
back
to
his
own
first
impressions
of
nathan
s
work
when
he
read
it
in
the
newsroom
of
the
cour
du
commerce
and
the
ruthless
bloodthirsty
critic
the
lively
mocker
became
a
poet
in
the
final
phrases
which
rose
and
fell
with
majestic
rhythm
like
the
swaying
censer
before
the
altar
one
hundred
francs
coralie
cried
he
holding
up
eight
sheets
of
paper
covered
with
writing
while
she
dressed
the
mood
was
upon
him
he
went
on
to
indite
stroke
by
stroke
the
promised
terrible
article
on
chatelet
and
mme
de
bargeton
that
morning
he
experienced
one
of
the
keenest
personal
pleasures
of
journalism
he
knew
what
it
was
to
forge
the
epigram
to
whet
and
polish
the
cold
blade
to
be
sheathed
in
a
victim
s
heart
to
make
of
the
hilt
a
cunning
piece
of
workmanship
for
the
reader
to
admire
for
the
public
admires
the
handle
the
delicate
work
of
the
brain
while
the
cruelty
is
not
apparent
how
should
the
public
know
that
the
steel
of
the
epigram
tempered
in
the
fire
of
revenge
has
been
plunged
deftly
to
rankle
in
the
very
quick
of
a
victim
s
vanity
and
is
reeking
from
wounds
innumerable
which
it
has
inflicted
it
is
a
hideous
joy
that
grim
solitary
pleasure
relished
without
witnesses
it
is
like
a
duel
with
an
absent
enemy
slain
at
a
distance
by
a
quill
a
journalist
might
really
possess
the
magical
power
of
talismans
in
eastern
tales
epigram
is
distilled
rancor
the
quintessence
of
a
hate
derived
from
all
the
worst
passions
of
man
even
as
love
concentrates
all
that
is
best
in
human
nature
the
man
does
not
exist
who
can
not
be
witty
to
avenge
himself
and
by
the
same
rule
there
is
not
one
to
whom
love
does
not
bring
delight
cheap
and
easy
as
this
kind
of
wit
may
be
in
france
it
is
always
relished
lucien
s
article
was
destined
to
raise
the
previous
reputation
of
the
paper
for
venomous
spite
and
his
article
probed
two
hearts
to
the
depths
it
dealt
a
grievous
wound
to
mme
de
bargeton
his
laura
of
old
days
as
well
as
to
his
rival
the
baron
du
chatelet
well
let
us
go
for
a
drive
in
the
bois
said
coralie
the
horses
are
fidgeting
there
is
no
need
to
kill
we
will
take
the
article
on
nathan
to
hector
journalism
is
really
very
much
like
achilles
lance
it
salves
the
wounds
that
it
makes
said
lucien
correcting
a
phrase
here
and
there
the
lovers
started
forth
in
splendor
to
show
themselves
to
the
paris
which
had
but
lately
given
lucien
the
cold
shoulder
and
now
was
beginning
to
talk
about
him
to
have
paris
talking
of
you
and
this
after
you
have
learned
how
large
the
great
city
is
how
hard
it
is
to
be
anybody
there
it
was
this
thought
that
turned
lucien
s
head
with
exultation
let
us
go
by
way
of
your
tailor
s
dear
boy
and
tell
him
to
be
quick
with
your
clothes
or
try
them
on
if
they
are
ready
if
you
are
going
to
your
fine
ladies
houses
you
shall
eclipse
that
monster
of
a
de
marsay
and
young
rastignac
and
any
or
maxime
de
trailles
or
vandenesse
of
them
all
remember
that
your
mistress
is
coralie
but
you
will
not
play
me
any
tricks
eh
two
days
afterwards
on
the
eve
of
the
at
coralie
s
house
there
was
a
new
play
at
the
ambigu
and
it
fell
to
lucien
to
write
the
dramatic
criticism
lucien
and
coralie
walked
together
after
dinner
from
the
rue
de
vendome
to
the
going
along
the
cafe
turc
side
of
the
boulevard
du
temple
a
lounge
much
frequented
at
that
time
people
wondered
at
his
luck
and
praised
coralie
s
beauty
chance
remarks
reached
his
ears
some
said
that
coralie
was
the
finest
woman
in
paris
others
that
lucien
was
a
match
for
her
the
romantic
youth
felt
that
he
was
in
his
atmosphere
this
was
the
life
for
him
the
brotherhood
was
so
far
away
that
it
was
almost
out
of
sight
only
two
months
ago
how
he
had
looked
up
to
those
lofty
great
natures
now
he
asked
himself
if
they
were
not
just
a
trifle
ridiculous
with
their
notions
and
their
puritanism
coralie
s
careless
words
had
lodged
in
lucien
s
mind
and
begun
already
to
bear
fruit
he
took
coralie
to
her
and
strolled
about
like
a
sultan
behind
the
scenes
the
actresses
gave
him
burning
glances
and
flattering
speeches
i
must
go
to
the
ambigu
and
attend
to
business
said
he
at
the
ambigu
the
house
was
full
there
was
not
a
seat
left
for
him
indignant
complaints
behind
the
scenes
brought
no
redress
the
keeper
who
did
not
know
him
as
yet
said
that
they
had
sent
orders
for
two
boxes
to
his
paper
and
sent
him
about
his
business
i
shall
speak
of
the
play
as
i
find
it
said
lucien
nettled
at
this
what
a
dunce
you
are
said
the
leading
lady
addressing
the
keeper
that
is
coralie
s
the
keeper
turned
round
immediately
at
this
i
will
speak
to
the
manager
at
once
sir
he
said
in
all
these
small
details
lucien
saw
the
immense
power
wielded
by
the
press
his
vanity
was
gratified
the
manager
appeared
to
say
that
the
duc
de
rhetore
and
tullia
the
were
in
the
and
they
had
consented
to
allow
lucien
to
join
them
you
have
driven
two
people
to
distraction
remarked
the
young
duke
mentioning
the
names
of
the
baron
du
chatelet
and
mme
de
bargeton
distraction
what
will
it
be
said
lucien
so
far
my
friends
have
been
mere
skirmishers
but
i
have
given
them
shot
you
will
know
why
we
are
making
game
of
the
article
is
called
potelet
from
to
chatelet
will
be
a
byword
a
name
for
the
type
of
courtiers
who
deny
their
benefactor
and
rally
to
the
bourbons
when
i
have
done
with
him
i
am
going
to
mme
de
montcornet
lucien
s
talk
was
sparkling
he
was
eager
that
this
great
personage
should
see
how
gross
a
mistake
mesdames
d
espard
and
de
bargeton
had
made
when
they
slighted
lucien
de
rubempre
but
he
showed
the
tip
of
his
ear
when
he
asserted
his
right
to
bear
the
name
of
rubempre
the
duc
de
rhetore
having
purposely
addressed
him
as
chardon
you
should
go
over
to
the
royalists
said
the
duke
you
have
proved
yourself
a
man
of
ability
now
show
your
good
sense
the
one
way
of
obtaining
a
patent
of
nobility
and
the
right
to
bear
the
title
of
your
mother
s
family
is
by
asking
for
it
in
return
for
services
to
be
rendered
to
the
court
the
liberals
will
never
make
a
count
of
you
the
restoration
will
get
the
better
of
the
press
you
see
in
the
long
run
and
the
press
is
the
only
formidable
power
they
have
borne
with
it
too
long
as
it
is
the
press
is
sure
to
be
muzzled
take
advantage
of
the
last
moments
of
liberty
to
make
yourself
formidable
and
you
will
have
everything
intellect
nobility
and
good
looks
nothing
will
be
out
of
your
reach
so
if
you
are
a
liberal
let
it
be
simply
for
the
moment
so
that
you
can
make
a
better
bargain
for
your
with
that
the
duke
entreated
lucien
to
accept
an
invitation
to
dinner
which
the
german
minister
of
florine
s
was
about
to
send
lucien
fell
under
the
charm
of
the
noble
peer
s
arguments
the
salons
from
which
he
had
been
exiled
for
ever
as
he
thought
but
a
few
months
ago
would
shortly
open
their
doors
for
him
he
was
delighted
he
marveled
at
the
power
of
the
press
intellect
and
the
press
these
then
were
the
real
powers
in
society
another
thought
shaped
itself
in
his
mind
was
etienne
lousteau
sorry
that
he
had
opened
the
gate
of
the
temple
to
a
newcomer
even
now
he
lucien
felt
on
his
own
account
that
it
was
strongly
advisable
to
put
difficulties
in
the
way
of
eager
and
ambitious
recruits
from
the
provinces
if
a
poet
should
come
to
him
as
he
had
flung
himself
into
etienne
s
arms
he
dared
not
think
of
the
reception
that
he
would
give
him
the
youthful
duke
meanwhile
saw
that
lucien
was
deep
in
thought
and
made
a
pretty
good
guess
at
the
matter
of
his
meditations
he
himself
had
opened
out
wide
horizons
of
public
life
before
an
ambitious
poet
with
a
vacillating
will
it
is
true
but
not
without
aspirations
and
the
journalists
had
already
shown
the
neophyte
from
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
of
letters
and
its
riches
lucien
himself
had
no
suspicion
of
a
little
plot
that
was
being
woven
nor
did
he
imagine
that
de
rhetore
had
a
hand
in
it
de
rhetore
had
spoken
of
lucien
s
cleverness
and
mme
d
espard
s
set
had
taken
alarm
mme
de
bargeton
had
commissioned
the
duke
to
sound
lucien
and
with
that
object
in
view
the
noble
youth
had
come
to
the
do
not
believe
in
stories
of
elaborate
treachery
neither
the
great
world
nor
the
world
of
journalists
laid
any
deep
schemes
definite
plans
are
not
made
by
either
their
machiavelism
lives
from
hand
to
mouth
so
to
speak
and
consists
for
the
most
part
in
being
always
on
the
spot
always
on
the
alert
to
turn
everything
to
account
always
on
the
watch
for
the
moment
when
a
man
s
ruling
passion
shall
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
the
young
duke
had
seen
through
lucien
at
florine
s
he
had
just
touched
his
vain
susceptibilities
and
now
he
was
trying
his
first
efforts
in
diplomacy
upon
the
living
subject
lucien
hurried
to
the
rue
after
the
play
to
write
his
article
it
was
a
piece
of
savage
and
bitter
criticism
written
in
pure
wantonness
he
was
amusing
himself
by
trying
his
power
the
melodrama
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
a
better
piece
than
the
but
lucien
wished
to
see
whether
he
could
damn
a
good
play
and
send
everybody
to
see
a
bad
one
as
his
associates
had
said
he
unfolded
the
sheet
at
breakfast
next
morning
telling
coralie
as
he
did
so
that
he
had
cut
up
the
and
not
a
little
astonished
was
he
to
find
below
his
paper
on
mme
de
bargeton
and
chatelet
a
notice
of
the
ambigu
so
mellowed
and
softened
in
the
course
of
the
night
that
although
the
witty
analysis
was
still
preserved
the
judgment
was
favorable
the
article
was
more
likely
to
fill
the
house
than
to
empty
it
no
words
can
describe
his
wrath
he
determined
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
lousteau
he
had
already
begun
to
think
himself
an
indispensable
man
and
he
vowed
that
he
would
not
submit
to
be
tyrannized
over
and
treated
like
a
fool
to
establish
his
power
beyond
cavil
he
wrote
the
article
for
dauriat
s
review
summing
up
and
weighing
all
the
various
opinions
concerning
nathan
s
book
and
while
he
was
in
the
humor
he
hit
off
another
of
his
short
sketches
for
lousteau
s
newspaper
inexperienced
journalists
in
the
first
effervescence
of
youth
make
a
labor
of
love
of
ephemeral
work
and
lavish
their
best
thought
unthriftily
thereon
the
manager
of
the
gave
a
first
performance
of
a
vaudeville
that
night
so
that
florine
and
coralie
might
be
free
for
the
evening
there
were
to
be
cards
before
supper
lousteau
came
for
the
short
notice
of
the
vaudeville
it
had
been
written
beforehand
after
the
general
rehearsal
for
etienne
wished
to
have
the
paper
off
his
mind
lucien
read
over
one
of
the
charming
sketches
of
parisian
whimsicalities
which
made
the
fortune
of
the
paper
and
lousteau
kissed
him
on
both
eyelids
and
called
him
the
providence
of
journalism
then
why
do
you
amuse
yourself
by
turning
my
article
inside
out
asked
lucien
he
had
written
his
brilliant
sketch
simply
and
solely
to
give
emphasis
to
his
grievance
exclaimed
lousteau
well
who
else
can
have
altered
my
article
you
do
not
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
yet
dear
fellow
the
ambigu
pays
for
thirty
copies
and
only
takes
nine
for
the
manager
and
box
and
their
mistresses
and
for
the
three
lessees
of
the
theatre
every
one
of
the
boulevard
theatres
pays
eight
hundred
francs
in
this
way
to
the
paper
and
there
is
quite
as
much
again
in
boxes
and
orders
for
finot
to
say
nothing
of
the
contributions
of
the
company
and
if
the
minor
theatres
do
this
you
may
imagine
what
the
big
ones
do
now
you
understand
we
are
bound
to
show
a
good
deal
of
i
understand
this
that
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
write
as
i
think
eh
what
does
that
matter
so
long
as
you
turn
an
honest
penny
cried
lousteau
besides
my
boy
what
grudge
had
you
against
the
theatre
you
must
have
had
some
reason
for
it
or
you
would
not
have
cut
up
the
play
as
you
did
if
you
slash
for
the
sake
of
slashing
the
paper
will
get
into
trouble
and
when
there
is
good
reason
for
hitting
hard
it
will
not
tell
did
the
manager
leave
you
out
in
the
cold
he
had
not
kept
a
place
for
good
said
lousteau
i
shall
let
him
see
your
article
and
tell
him
that
i
softened
it
down
you
will
find
it
serves
you
better
than
if
it
had
appeared
in
print
go
and
ask
him
for
tickets
and
he
will
sign
forty
blank
orders
every
month
i
know
a
man
who
can
get
rid
of
them
for
you
i
will
introduce
you
to
him
and
he
will
buy
them
all
up
at
there
is
a
trade
done
in
theatre
tickets
just
as
barbet
trades
in
reviewers
copies
this
is
another
barbet
the
leader
of
the
he
lives
near
by
come
and
see
him
there
is
time
but
my
dear
fellow
it
is
a
scandalous
thing
that
finot
should
levy
blackmail
in
matters
intellectual
sooner
or
later
really
cried
lousteau
where
do
you
come
from
for
what
do
you
take
finot
beneath
his
pretence
of
his
ignorance
and
stupidity
and
those
turcaret
s
airs
of
his
there
is
all
the
cunning
of
his
father
the
hatter
did
you
notice
an
old
soldier
of
the
empire
in
the
den
at
the
office
that
is
finot
s
uncle
the
uncle
is
not
only
one
of
the
right
sort
he
has
the
luck
to
be
taken
for
a
fool
and
he
takes
all
that
kind
of
business
upon
his
shoulders
an
ambitious
man
in
paris
is
well
off
indeed
if
he
has
a
willing
scapegoat
at
hand
in
public
life
as
in
journalism
there
are
hosts
of
emergencies
in
which
the
chiefs
can
not
afford
to
appear
if
finot
should
enter
on
a
political
career
his
uncle
would
be
his
secretary
and
receive
all
the
contributions
levied
in
his
department
on
big
affairs
anybody
would
take
giroudeau
for
a
fool
at
first
sight
but
he
has
just
enough
shrewdness
to
be
an
inscrutable
old
file
he
is
on
picket
duty
he
sees
that
we
are
not
pestered
with
hubbub
beginners
wanting
a
job
or
advertisements
no
other
paper
has
his
equal
i
he
plays
his
part
well
said
lucien
i
saw
him
at
etienne
and
lucien
reached
a
handsome
house
in
the
rue
du
is
braulard
in
etienne
asked
of
the
porter
said
lucien
then
is
the
leader
of
the
monsieur
my
dear
boy
braulard
has
twenty
thousand
francs
of
income
all
the
dramatic
authors
of
the
boulevards
are
in
his
clutches
and
have
a
standing
account
with
him
as
if
he
were
a
banker
orders
and
complimentary
tickets
are
sold
here
braulard
knows
where
to
get
rid
of
such
merchandise
now
for
a
turn
at
statistics
a
useful
science
enough
in
its
way
at
the
rate
of
fifty
complimentary
tickets
every
evening
for
each
theatre
you
have
two
hundred
and
fifty
tickets
daily
suppose
taking
one
with
another
that
they
are
worth
a
couple
of
francs
apiece
braulard
pays
a
hundred
and
francs
daily
for
them
and
takes
his
chance
of
making
cent
per
cent
in
this
way
authors
tickets
alone
bring
him
in
about
four
thousand
francs
every
month
or
thousand
francs
per
annum
allow
twenty
thousand
francs
for
loss
for
he
can
not
always
place
all
his
tickets
why
not
oh
the
people
who
pay
at
the
door
go
in
with
the
holders
of
complimentary
tickets
for
unreserved
seats
and
the
theatre
reserves
the
right
of
admitting
those
who
pay
there
are
fine
warm
evenings
to
be
reckoned
with
besides
and
poor
plays
braulard
makes
perhaps
thirty
thousand
francs
every
year
in
this
way
and
he
has
his
besides
another
industry
florine
and
coralie
pay
tribute
to
him
if
they
did
not
there
would
be
no
applause
when
they
come
on
or
go
lousteau
gave
this
explanation
in
a
low
voice
as
they
went
up
the
stair
paris
is
a
queer
place
said
lucien
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
squatting
in
every
corner
a
smart
opened
the
door
at
the
sight
of
etienne
lousteau
the
dealer
in
orders
and
tickets
rose
from
a
sturdy
chair
before
a
large
cylinder
desk
and
lucien
beheld
the
leader
of
the
braulard
himself
dressed
in
a
gray
molleton
jacket
footed
trousers
and
red
slippers
for
all
the
world
like
a
doctor
or
a
solicitor
he
was
a
typical
man
lucien
thought
a
face
with
a
pair
of
exceedingly
cunning
gray
eyes
hands
made
for
hired
applause
a
complexion
over
which
hard
living
had
passed
like
rain
over
a
roof
grizzled
hair
and
a
somewhat
husky
voice
you
have
come
from
mlle
florine
no
doubt
sir
and
this
gentleman
for
mlle
coralie
said
braulard
i
know
you
very
well
by
sight
don
t
trouble
yourself
sir
he
continued
addressing
lucien
i
am
buying
the
gymnase
connection
i
will
look
after
your
lady
and
i
will
give
her
notice
of
any
tricks
they
may
try
to
play
on
that
is
not
an
offer
to
be
refused
my
dear
braulard
but
we
have
come
about
the
press
orders
for
the
boulevard
theatres
i
as
editor
and
this
gentleman
as
dramatic
oh
ah
yes
finot
has
sold
his
paper
i
heard
about
it
he
is
getting
on
is
finot
i
have
asked
him
to
dine
with
me
at
the
end
of
the
week
if
you
will
do
me
the
honor
and
pleasure
of
coming
you
may
bring
your
ladies
and
there
will
be
a
grand
jollification
adele
dupuis
is
coming
and
ducange
and
frederic
du
and
mlle
millot
my
mistress
we
shall
have
good
fun
and
better
ducange
must
be
in
difficulties
he
has
lost
his
i
have
lent
him
ten
thousand
francs
if
succeeds
it
will
repay
the
loan
so
i
have
been
organizing
a
success
ducange
is
a
clever
man
he
has
brains
lucien
fancied
that
he
must
be
dreaming
when
he
heard
a
appraising
a
writer
s
value
coralie
has
improved
continued
braulard
with
the
air
of
a
competent
critic
if
she
is
a
good
girl
i
will
take
her
part
for
they
have
got
up
a
cabal
against
her
at
the
gymnase
this
is
how
i
mean
to
do
it
i
will
have
a
few
men
in
the
balconies
to
smile
and
make
a
little
murmur
and
the
applause
will
follow
that
is
a
dodge
which
makes
a
position
for
an
actress
i
have
a
liking
for
coralie
and
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
for
she
has
feeling
aha
i
can
hiss
any
one
on
the
stage
if
i
but
let
us
settle
this
business
about
the
tickets
put
in
lousteau
very
well
i
will
come
to
this
gentleman
s
lodging
for
them
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
and
i
will
treat
him
as
i
do
you
you
have
five
theatres
you
will
get
thirty
tickets
that
will
be
something
like
francs
a
month
perhaps
you
will
be
wanting
an
advance
added
braulard
lifting
a
full
of
coin
out
of
his
desk
no
no
said
lousteau
we
will
keep
that
shift
against
a
rainy
i
will
work
with
coralie
sir
and
we
will
come
to
an
understanding
said
braulard
addressing
lucien
who
was
looking
about
him
not
without
profound
astonishment
there
was
a
bookcase
in
braulard
s
study
there
were
framed
engravings
and
good
furniture
and
as
they
passed
through
the
drawing
room
he
noticed
that
the
fittings
were
neither
too
luxurious
nor
yet
mean
the
seemed
to
be
the
best
ordered
room
he
remarked
on
this
jokingly
but
braulard
is
an
epicure
said
lousteau
his
dinners
are
famous
in
dramatic
literature
and
they
are
what
you
might
expect
from
his
i
have
good
wine
braulard
replied
ah
here
are
my
lamplighters
he
added
as
a
sound
of
hoarse
voices
and
strange
footsteps
came
up
from
the
staircase
lucien
on
his
way
down
saw
a
march
past
of
and
retailers
of
tickets
it
was
an
ill
smelling
squad
attired
in
caps
seedy
trousers
and
threadbare
overcoats
a
flock
of
with
bluish
and
greenish
tints
in
their
faces
neglected
beards
and
a
strange
mixture
of
savagery
and
subservience
in
their
eyes
a
horrible
population
lives
and
swarms
upon
the
paris
boulevards
selling
watch
guards
and
brass
jewelry
in
the
streets
by
day
applauding
under
the
chandeliers
of
the
theatre
at
night
and
ready
to
lend
themselves
to
any
dirty
business
in
the
great
city
behold
the
romans
laughed
lousteau
behold
fame
incarnate
for
actresses
and
dramatic
authors
it
is
no
prettier
than
our
own
when
you
come
to
look
at
it
it
is
difficult
to
keep
illusions
on
any
subject
in
paris
answered
lucien
as
they
turned
in
at
his
door
there
is
a
tax
upon
everything
everything
has
its
price
and
anything
can
be
made
to
order
even
thirty
guests
were
assembled
that
evening
in
coralie
s
rooms
her
dining
room
would
not
hold
more
lucien
had
asked
dauriat
and
the
manager
of
the
matifat
and
florine
camusot
lousteau
finot
nathan
hector
merlin
and
mme
du
felicien
vernou
blondet
vignon
philippe
bridau
mariette
giroudeau
cardot
and
florentine
and
bixiou
he
had
also
asked
all
his
friends
of
the
rue
des
tullia
the
dancer
who
was
not
unkind
said
gossip
to
du
bruel
had
come
without
her
duke
the
proprietors
of
the
newspapers
for
whom
most
of
the
journalists
wrote
were
also
of
the
party
at
eight
o
clock
when
the
lights
of
the
candles
in
the
chandeliers
shone
over
the
furniture
the
hangings
and
the
flowers
the
rooms
wore
the
festal
air
that
gives
to
parisian
luxury
the
appearance
of
a
dream
and
lucien
felt
indefinable
stirrings
of
hope
and
gratified
vanity
and
pleasure
at
the
thought
that
he
was
the
master
of
the
house
but
how
and
by
whom
the
magic
wand
had
been
waved
he
no
longer
sought
to
remember
florine
and
coralie
dressed
with
the
fanciful
extravagance
and
magnificent
artistic
effect
of
the
stage
smiled
on
the
poet
like
two
fairies
at
the
gates
of
the
palace
of
dreams
and
lucien
was
almost
in
a
dream
his
life
had
been
changed
so
suddenly
during
the
last
few
months
he
had
gone
so
swiftly
from
the
depths
of
penury
to
the
last
extreme
of
luxury
that
at
moments
he
felt
as
uncomfortable
as
a
dreaming
man
who
knows
that
he
is
asleep
and
yet
he
looked
round
at
the
fair
reality
about
him
with
a
confidence
to
which
envious
minds
might
have
given
the
name
of
fatuity
lucien
himself
had
changed
he
had
grown
paler
during
these
days
of
continual
enjoyment
languor
had
lent
a
humid
look
to
his
eyes
in
short
to
use
mme
d
espard
s
expression
he
looked
like
a
man
who
is
loved
he
was
the
handsomer
for
it
consciousness
of
his
powers
and
his
strength
was
visible
in
his
face
enlightened
as
it
was
by
love
and
experience
looking
out
over
the
world
of
letters
and
of
men
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
might
go
to
and
fro
as
lord
of
it
all
sober
reflection
never
entered
his
romantic
head
unless
it
was
driven
in
by
the
pressure
of
adversity
and
just
now
the
present
held
not
a
care
for
him
the
breath
of
praise
swelled
the
sails
of
his
skiff
all
the
instruments
of
success
lay
there
to
his
hand
he
had
an
establishment
a
mistress
whom
all
paris
envied
him
a
carriage
and
untold
wealth
in
his
inkstand
heart
and
soul
and
brain
were
alike
transformed
within
him
why
should
he
care
to
be
over
nice
about
the
means
when
the
great
results
were
visibly
there
before
his
eyes
as
such
a
style
of
living
will
seem
and
with
good
reason
to
be
anything
but
secure
to
economists
who
have
any
experience
of
paris
it
will
not
be
superfluous
to
give
a
glance
to
the
foundation
uncertain
as
it
was
upon
which
the
prosperity
of
the
pair
was
based
camusot
had
given
coralie
s
tradesmen
instructions
to
grant
her
credit
for
three
months
at
least
and
this
had
been
done
without
her
knowledge
during
those
three
months
therefore
horses
and
servants
like
everything
else
waited
as
if
by
enchantment
at
the
bidding
of
two
children
eager
for
enjoyment
and
enjoying
to
their
hearts
content
coralie
had
taken
lucien
s
hand
and
given
him
a
glimpse
of
the
transformation
scene
in
the
of
the
splendidly
appointed
table
of
chandeliers
each
fitted
with
forty
of
the
royally
luxurious
dessert
and
a
menu
of
chevet
s
lucien
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
held
her
closely
to
his
heart
i
shall
succeed
child
he
said
and
then
i
will
repay
you
for
such
love
and
pshaw
said
coralie
are
you
satisfied
i
should
be
very
hard
to
please
if
i
were
very
well
then
that
smile
of
yours
pays
for
everything
she
said
and
with
a
serpentine
movement
she
raised
her
head
and
laid
her
lips
against
his
when
they
went
back
to
the
others
florine
lousteau
matifat
and
camusot
were
setting
out
the
lucien
s
friends
began
to
arrive
for
already
these
folk
began
to
call
themselves
lucien
s
friends
and
they
sat
over
the
cards
from
nine
o
clock
till
midnight
lucien
was
unacquainted
with
a
single
game
but
lousteau
lost
a
thousand
francs
and
lucien
could
not
refuse
to
lend
him
the
money
when
he
asked
for
it
michel
fulgence
and
joseph
appeared
about
ten
o
clock
and
lucien
chatting
with
them
in
a
corner
saw
that
they
looked
sober
and
serious
enough
not
to
say
ill
at
ease
d
arthez
could
not
come
he
was
finishing
his
book
leon
giraud
was
busy
with
the
first
number
of
his
review
so
the
brotherhood
had
sent
three
artists
among
their
number
thinking
that
they
would
feel
less
out
of
their
element
in
an
uproarious
supper
party
than
the
rest
well
my
dear
fellows
said
lucien
assuming
a
slightly
patronizing
tone
the
comical
fellow
may
become
a
great
public
character
yet
you
i
wish
i
may
be
mistaken
i
don
t
ask
better
said
michel
are
you
living
with
coralie
until
you
can
do
better
asked
fulgence
yes
said
lucien
trying
to
look
unconscious
coralie
had
an
elderly
adorer
a
merchant
and
she
showed
him
the
door
poor
fellow
i
am
better
off
than
your
brother
philippe
he
added
addressing
joseph
bridau
he
does
not
know
how
to
manage
you
are
a
man
like
another
now
in
short
you
will
make
your
way
said
fulgence
a
man
that
will
always
be
the
same
for
you
under
all
circumstances
returned
lucien
michel
and
fulgence
exchanged
incredulous
scornful
smiles
at
this
lucien
saw
the
absurdity
of
his
remark
coralie
is
wonderfully
beautiful
exclaimed
joseph
bridau
what
a
magnificent
portrait
she
would
make
beautiful
and
good
said
lucien
she
is
an
angel
upon
my
word
and
you
shall
paint
her
portrait
she
shall
sit
to
you
if
you
like
for
your
venetian
lady
brought
by
the
old
woman
to
the
all
women
who
love
are
angelic
said
michel
chrestien
just
at
that
moment
raoul
nathan
flew
upon
lucien
and
grasped
both
his
hands
and
shook
them
in
a
sudden
access
of
violent
friendship
oh
my
good
friend
you
are
something
more
than
a
great
man
you
have
a
heart
cried
he
a
much
rarer
thing
than
genius
in
these
days
you
are
a
devoted
friend
i
am
yours
in
short
through
thick
and
thin
i
shall
never
forget
all
that
you
have
done
for
me
this
lucien
s
joy
had
reached
the
highest
point
to
be
thus
caressed
by
a
man
of
whom
everyone
was
talking
he
looked
at
his
three
friends
of
the
brotherhood
with
something
like
a
superior
air
nathan
s
appearance
upon
the
scene
was
the
result
of
an
overture
from
merlin
who
sent
him
a
proof
of
the
favorable
review
to
appear
in
s
issue
i
only
consented
to
write
the
attack
on
condition
that
i
should
be
allowed
to
reply
to
it
myself
lucien
said
in
nathan
s
ear
i
am
one
of
this
incident
was
opportune
it
justified
the
remark
which
amused
fulgence
lucien
was
radiant
when
d
arthez
s
book
comes
out
he
said
turning
to
the
three
i
am
in
a
position
to
be
useful
to
him
that
thought
in
itself
would
induce
me
to
remain
a
can
you
do
as
you
like
michel
asked
quickly
so
far
as
one
can
when
one
is
indispensable
said
lucien
modestly
it
was
almost
midnight
when
they
sat
down
to
supper
and
the
fun
grew
fast
and
furious
talk
was
less
restrained
in
lucien
s
house
than
at
matifat
s
for
no
one
suspected
that
the
representatives
of
the
brotherhood
and
the
newspaper
writers
held
divergent
opinions
young
intellects
depraved
by
arguing
for
either
side
now
came
into
conflict
with
each
other
and
fearful
axioms
of
the
journalistic
jurisprudence
then
in
its
infancy
hurtled
to
and
fro
claude
vignon
upholding
the
dignity
of
criticism
inveighed
against
the
tendency
of
the
smaller
newspapers
saying
that
the
writers
of
personalities
lowered
themselves
in
the
end
lousteau
merlin
and
finot
took
up
the
cudgels
for
the
system
known
by
the
name
of
puffery
gossip
and
humbug
said
they
was
the
test
of
talent
and
set
the
as
it
were
upon
it
any
man
who
can
stand
that
test
has
real
power
said
lousteau
besides
cried
merlin
when
a
great
man
receives
ovations
there
ought
to
be
a
chorus
in
insults
to
balance
as
in
a
roman
oho
put
in
lucien
then
every
one
held
up
to
ridicule
in
print
will
fancy
that
he
has
made
a
any
one
would
think
that
the
question
interested
you
exclaimed
finot
and
how
about
our
sonnets
said
michel
chrestien
is
that
the
way
they
will
win
us
the
fame
of
a
second
petrarch
laura
already
counts
for
something
in
his
fame
said
dauriat
a
pun
laure
l
or
received
with
acclamations
experimentum
in
anima
retorted
lucien
with
a
smile
and
woe
unto
him
whom
reviewers
shall
spare
flinging
him
crowns
at
his
first
appearance
for
he
shall
be
shelved
like
the
saints
in
their
shrines
and
no
man
shall
pay
him
the
slightest
attention
said
vernou
people
will
say
look
elsewhere
simpleton
you
have
had
your
due
already
as
champcenetz
said
to
the
marquis
de
genlis
who
was
looking
too
fondly
at
his
wife
added
blondet
success
is
the
ruin
of
a
man
in
france
said
finot
we
are
so
jealous
of
one
another
that
we
try
to
forget
and
to
make
others
forget
the
triumphs
of
contradiction
is
the
life
of
literature
in
fact
said
claude
vignon
in
art
as
in
nature
there
are
two
principles
everywhere
at
strife
exclaimed
fulgence
and
victory
for
either
means
so
it
is
with
politics
added
michel
chrestien
we
have
a
case
in
point
said
lousteau
dauriat
will
sell
a
couple
of
thousand
copies
of
nathan
s
book
in
the
coming
week
and
why
because
the
book
that
was
cleverly
attacked
will
be
ably
merlin
took
up
the
proof
of
s
paper
how
can
such
an
article
fail
to
sell
an
edition
he
asked
read
the
article
said
dauriat
i
am
a
publisher
wherever
i
am
even
at
merlin
read
lucien
s
triumphant
refutation
aloud
and
the
whole
party
applauded
how
could
that
article
have
been
written
unless
the
attack
had
preceded
it
asked
lousteau
dauriat
drew
the
proof
of
the
third
article
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
over
finot
listening
closely
for
it
was
to
appear
in
the
second
number
of
his
own
review
and
as
editor
he
exaggerated
his
enthusiasm
gentlemen
said
he
so
and
not
otherwise
would
bossuet
have
written
if
he
had
lived
in
our
i
am
sure
of
it
said
merlin
bossuet
would
have
been
a
journalist
to
bossuet
the
second
cried
claude
vignon
raising
his
glass
with
an
ironical
bow
to
my
christopher
columbus
returned
lucien
drinking
a
health
to
dauriat
bravo
cried
nathan
is
it
a
nickname
merlin
inquired
looking
maliciously
from
finot
to
lucien
if
you
go
on
at
this
pace
you
will
be
quite
beyond
us
said
dauriat
these
gentlemen
indicating
camusot
and
matifat
can
not
follow
you
as
it
is
a
joke
is
like
a
bit
of
thread
if
it
is
spun
too
fine
it
breaks
as
bonaparte
gentlemen
said
lousteau
we
have
been
of
a
strange
portentous
and
truly
surprising
phenomenon
admire
the
rapidity
with
which
our
friend
here
has
been
transformed
from
a
provincial
into
a
journalist
he
is
a
born
journalist
said
dauriat
children
called
finot
rising
to
his
feet
all
of
us
here
present
have
encouraged
and
protected
our
amphitryon
in
his
entrance
upon
a
career
in
which
he
has
already
surpassed
our
hopes
in
two
months
he
has
shown
us
what
he
can
do
in
a
series
of
excellent
articles
known
to
us
all
i
propose
to
baptize
him
in
form
as
a
a
crown
of
roses
to
signalize
a
double
conquest
cried
bixiou
glancing
at
coralie
coralie
made
a
sign
to
berenice
that
portly
handmaid
went
to
coralie
s
and
brought
back
a
box
of
tumbled
artificial
flowers
the
more
incapable
members
of
the
party
were
grotesquely
tricked
out
in
these
blossoms
and
a
crown
of
roses
was
soon
woven
finot
as
high
priest
sprinkled
a
few
drops
of
champagne
on
lucien
s
golden
curls
pronouncing
with
delicious
gravity
the
words
in
the
name
of
the
government
stamp
the
and
the
fine
i
baptize
thee
journalist
may
thy
articles
sit
lightly
on
thee
and
may
they
be
paid
for
including
white
lines
cried
merlin
just
at
that
moment
lucien
caught
sight
of
three
melancholy
faces
michel
chrestien
joseph
bridau
and
fulgence
ridal
took
up
their
hats
and
went
out
amid
a
storm
of
invective
queer
customers
said
merlin
fulgence
used
to
be
a
good
fellow
added
lousteau
before
they
perverted
his
who
are
they
asked
claude
vignon
some
very
serious
young
men
said
blondet
who
meet
at
a
symposium
in
the
rue
des
and
worry
themselves
about
the
meaning
of
human
life
oh
oh
they
are
trying
to
find
out
whether
it
goes
round
in
a
circle
or
makes
some
progress
continued
blondet
they
were
very
hard
put
to
it
between
the
straight
line
and
the
curve
the
triangle
warranted
by
scripture
seemed
to
them
to
be
nonsense
when
lo
there
arose
among
them
some
prophet
or
other
who
declared
for
the
men
might
meet
to
invent
more
dangerous
nonsense
than
that
exclaimed
lucien
making
a
faint
attempt
to
champion
the
brotherhood
you
take
theories
of
that
sort
for
idle
words
said
felicien
vernou
but
a
time
comes
when
the
arguments
take
the
form
of
gunshot
and
the
they
have
not
come
to
that
yet
said
bixiou
they
have
only
come
as
far
as
the
designs
of
providence
in
the
invention
of
champagne
the
humanitarian
significance
of
breeches
and
the
blind
deity
who
keeps
the
world
going
they
pick
up
fallen
great
men
like
vico
and
fourier
i
am
much
afraid
that
they
will
turn
poor
joseph
bridau
s
head
among
bianchon
my
old
schoolfellow
gives
me
the
cold
shoulder
now
said
lousteau
it
is
all
their
doing
do
they
give
lectures
on
orthopedy
and
intellectual
gymnastics
asked
merlin
very
likely
answered
finot
if
bianchon
has
any
hand
in
their
pshaw
said
lousteau
he
will
be
a
great
physician
isn
t
d
arthez
their
visible
head
asked
nathan
a
little
youngster
that
is
going
to
swallow
all
of
us
he
is
a
genius
cried
lucien
genius
is
he
well
give
me
a
glass
of
sherry
said
claude
vignon
smiling
every
one
thereupon
began
to
explain
his
character
for
the
benefit
of
his
neighbor
and
when
a
clever
man
feels
a
pressing
need
of
explaining
himself
and
of
unlocking
his
heart
it
is
pretty
clear
that
wine
has
got
the
upper
hand
an
hour
later
all
the
men
in
the
company
were
the
best
friends
in
the
world
addressing
each
other
as
great
men
and
bold
spirits
who
held
the
future
in
their
hands
lucien
in
his
quality
of
host
was
sufficiently
clearheaded
to
apprehend
the
meaning
of
the
sophistries
which
impressed
him
and
completed
his
demoralization
the
liberal
party
announced
finot
is
compelled
to
stir
up
discussion
somehow
there
is
no
fault
to
find
with
the
action
of
the
government
and
you
may
imagine
what
a
fix
the
opposition
is
in
which
of
you
now
cares
to
write
a
pamphlet
in
favor
of
the
system
of
primogeniture
and
raise
a
cry
against
the
secret
designs
of
the
court
the
pamphlet
will
be
paid
for
i
will
write
it
said
hector
merlin
it
is
my
own
point
of
your
party
will
complain
that
you
are
compromising
them
said
finot
felicien
you
must
undertake
it
dauriat
will
bring
it
out
and
we
will
keep
the
how
much
shall
i
get
six
hundred
francs
sign
it
le
comte
c
three
it
s
a
bargain
said
felicien
vernou
so
you
are
introducing
the
to
the
political
world
remarked
lousteau
it
is
simply
the
chabot
affair
carried
into
the
region
of
abstract
ideas
said
finot
fasten
intentions
on
the
government
and
then
let
loose
public
how
a
government
can
leave
the
control
of
ideas
to
such
a
pack
of
scamps
as
we
are
is
matter
for
perpetual
and
profound
astonishment
to
me
said
claude
vignon
if
the
ministry
blunders
so
far
as
to
come
down
into
the
arena
we
can
give
them
a
drubbing
if
they
are
nettled
by
it
the
thing
will
rankle
in
people
s
minds
and
the
government
will
lose
its
hold
on
the
masses
the
newspaper
risks
nothing
and
the
authorities
have
everything
to
france
will
be
a
cipher
until
newspapers
are
abolished
by
law
said
claude
vignon
you
are
making
progress
hourly
he
added
addressing
finot
you
are
a
modern
order
of
jesuits
lacking
the
creed
the
fixed
idea
the
discipline
and
the
they
went
back
to
the
and
before
long
the
light
of
the
candles
grew
feeble
in
the
dawn
lucien
your
friends
from
the
rue
des
looked
as
dismal
as
criminals
going
to
be
hanged
said
coralie
they
were
the
judges
not
the
criminals
replied
the
poet
judges
are
more
amusing
than
said
coralie
for
a
month
lucien
s
whole
time
was
taken
up
with
supper
parties
dinner
engagements
breakfasts
and
evening
parties
he
was
swept
away
by
an
irresistible
current
into
a
vortex
of
dissipation
and
easy
work
he
no
longer
thought
of
the
future
the
power
of
calculation
amid
the
complications
of
life
is
the
sign
of
a
strong
will
which
poets
weaklings
and
men
who
live
a
purely
intellectual
life
can
never
counterfeit
lucien
was
living
from
hand
to
mouth
spending
his
money
as
fast
as
he
made
it
like
many
another
journalist
nor
did
he
give
so
much
as
a
thought
to
those
periodically
recurrent
days
of
reckoning
which
chequer
the
life
of
the
bohemian
in
paris
so
sadly
in
dress
and
figure
he
was
a
rival
for
the
great
dandies
of
the
day
coralie
like
all
zealots
loved
to
adorn
her
idol
she
ruined
herself
to
give
her
beloved
poet
the
accoutrements
which
had
so
stirred
his
envy
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
lucien
had
wonderful
canes
and
a
charming
eyeglass
he
had
diamond
studs
and
and
besides
an
assortment
of
waistcoats
marvelous
to
behold
and
in
sufficient
number
to
match
every
color
in
a
variety
of
costumes
his
transition
to
the
estate
of
dandy
swiftly
followed
when
he
went
to
the
german
minister
s
dinner
all
the
young
men
regarded
him
with
suppressed
envy
yet
de
marsay
vandenesse
maxime
de
trailles
rastignac
beaudenord
manerville
and
the
duc
de
maufrigneuse
gave
place
to
none
in
the
kingdom
of
fashion
men
of
fashion
are
as
jealous
among
themselves
as
women
and
in
the
same
way
lucien
was
placed
between
mme
de
montcornet
and
mme
d
espard
in
whose
honor
the
dinner
was
given
both
ladies
overwhelmed
him
with
flatteries
why
did
you
turn
your
back
on
society
when
you
would
have
been
so
well
received
asked
the
marquise
every
one
was
prepared
to
make
much
of
you
and
i
have
a
quarrel
with
you
too
you
owed
me
a
call
i
am
still
waiting
to
receive
it
i
saw
you
at
the
opera
the
other
day
and
you
would
not
deign
to
come
to
see
me
nor
to
take
any
notice
of
your
cousin
madame
so
unmistakably
dismissed
me
oh
you
do
not
know
women
the
marquise
d
espard
broke
in
upon
him
you
have
wounded
the
most
angelic
heart
the
noblest
nature
that
i
know
you
do
not
know
all
that
louise
was
trying
to
do
for
you
nor
how
tactfully
she
laid
her
plans
for
oh
and
she
would
have
succeeded
the
marquise
continued
replying
to
lucien
s
mute
incredulity
her
husband
is
dead
now
died
as
he
was
bound
to
die
of
an
indigestion
could
you
doubt
that
she
would
be
free
sooner
or
later
and
can
you
suppose
that
she
would
like
to
be
madame
chardon
it
was
worth
while
to
take
some
trouble
to
gain
the
title
of
comtesse
de
rubempre
love
you
see
is
a
great
vanity
which
requires
the
lesser
vanities
to
be
in
harmony
with
itself
especially
in
marriage
i
might
love
you
to
madness
which
is
to
say
sufficiently
to
marry
you
and
yet
i
should
find
it
very
unpleasant
to
be
called
madame
chardon
you
can
see
that
and
now
that
you
understand
the
difficulties
of
paris
life
you
will
know
how
many
roundabout
ways
you
must
take
to
reach
your
end
very
well
then
you
must
admit
that
louise
was
aspiring
to
an
all
but
impossible
piece
of
court
favor
she
was
quite
unknown
she
is
not
rich
and
therefore
she
could
not
afford
to
neglect
any
means
of
success
you
are
clever
the
marquise
d
espard
continued
but
we
women
when
we
love
are
cleverer
than
the
cleverest
man
my
cousin
tried
to
make
that
absurd
chatelet
useful
oh
she
broke
off
i
owe
not
a
little
amusement
to
you
your
articles
on
chatelet
made
me
laugh
lucien
knew
not
what
to
think
of
all
this
of
the
treachery
and
bad
faith
of
journalism
he
had
had
some
experience
but
in
spite
of
his
perspicacity
he
scarcely
expected
to
find
bad
faith
or
treachery
in
society
there
were
some
sharp
lessons
in
store
for
him
but
madame
he
objected
for
her
words
aroused
a
lively
curiosity
is
not
the
heron
under
your
protection
one
is
obliged
to
be
civil
to
one
s
worst
enemies
in
society
protested
she
one
may
be
bored
but
one
must
look
as
if
the
talk
was
amusing
and
not
seldom
one
seems
to
sacrifice
friends
the
better
to
serve
them
are
you
still
a
novice
you
mean
to
write
and
yet
you
know
nothing
of
current
deceit
my
cousin
apparently
sacrificed
you
to
the
heron
but
how
could
she
dispense
with
his
influence
for
you
our
friend
stands
well
with
the
present
ministry
and
we
have
made
him
see
that
your
attacks
will
do
him
service
up
to
a
certain
point
for
we
want
you
to
make
it
up
again
some
of
these
days
chatelet
has
received
compensations
for
his
troubles
for
as
des
lupeaulx
said
while
the
newspapers
are
making
chatelet
ridiculous
they
will
leave
the
ministry
in
there
was
a
pause
the
marquise
left
lucien
to
his
own
reflections
m
blondet
led
me
to
hope
that
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
in
my
house
said
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
you
will
meet
a
few
artists
and
men
of
letters
and
some
one
else
who
has
the
keenest
desire
to
become
acquainted
with
you
mlle
des
touches
the
owner
of
talents
rare
among
our
sex
you
will
go
to
her
house
no
doubt
mlle
de
touches
or
camille
maupin
if
you
prefer
it
is
prodigiously
rich
and
presides
over
one
of
the
most
remarkable
salons
in
paris
she
has
heard
that
you
are
as
handsome
as
you
are
clever
and
is
dying
to
meet
lucien
could
only
pour
out
incoherent
thanks
and
glance
enviously
at
emile
blondet
there
was
as
great
a
difference
between
a
great
lady
like
mme
de
montcornet
and
coralie
as
between
coralie
and
a
girl
out
of
the
streets
the
countess
was
young
and
witty
and
beautiful
with
the
very
white
fairness
of
women
of
the
north
her
mother
was
the
princess
scherbellof
and
the
minister
before
dinner
had
paid
her
the
most
respectful
attention
by
this
time
the
marquise
had
made
an
end
of
trifling
disdainfully
with
the
wing
of
a
chicken
my
poor
louise
felt
so
much
affection
for
you
she
said
she
took
me
into
her
confidence
i
knew
her
dreams
of
a
great
career
for
you
she
would
have
borne
a
great
deal
but
what
scorn
you
showed
her
when
you
sent
back
her
letters
cruelty
we
can
forgive
those
who
hurt
us
must
have
still
some
faith
in
us
but
indifference
indifference
is
like
polar
snows
it
extinguishes
all
life
so
you
must
see
that
you
have
lost
a
precious
affection
through
your
own
fault
why
break
with
her
even
if
she
had
scorned
you
you
had
your
way
to
make
had
you
not
your
name
to
win
back
louise
thought
of
all
then
why
was
she
silent
mon
dieu
cried
the
marquise
it
was
i
myself
who
advised
her
not
to
take
you
into
her
confidence
between
ourselves
you
know
you
seemed
so
little
used
to
the
ways
of
the
world
that
i
took
alarm
i
was
afraid
that
your
inexperience
and
rash
ardor
might
wreck
our
schemes
can
you
recollect
yourself
as
you
were
then
you
must
admit
that
if
you
could
see
your
double
you
would
say
the
same
yourself
you
are
not
like
the
same
man
that
was
our
mistake
but
would
one
man
in
a
thousand
combine
such
intellectual
gifts
with
such
wonderful
aptitude
for
taking
the
tone
of
society
i
did
not
think
that
you
would
be
such
an
astonishing
exception
you
were
transformed
so
quickly
you
acquired
the
manner
of
paris
so
easily
that
i
did
not
recognize
you
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
a
month
lucien
heard
the
great
lady
with
inexpressible
pleasure
the
flatteries
were
spoken
with
such
a
petulant
childlike
confiding
air
and
she
seemed
to
take
such
a
deep
interest
in
him
that
he
thought
of
his
first
evening
at
the
and
began
to
fancy
that
some
such
miracle
was
about
to
take
place
a
second
time
everything
had
smiled
upon
him
since
that
happy
evening
his
youth
he
thought
was
the
talisman
that
worked
this
change
he
would
prove
this
great
lady
she
should
not
take
him
unawares
then
what
were
these
schemes
which
have
turned
to
chimeras
madame
asked
he
louise
meant
to
obtain
a
royal
patent
permitting
you
to
bear
the
name
and
title
of
rubempre
she
wished
to
put
chardon
out
of
sight
your
opinions
have
put
that
out
of
the
question
now
but
it
would
not
have
been
so
hard
to
manage
and
a
title
would
mean
a
fortune
for
you
you
will
look
on
these
things
as
trifles
and
visionary
ideas
she
continued
but
we
know
something
of
life
and
we
know
too
all
the
solid
advantages
of
a
count
s
title
when
it
is
borne
by
a
fashionable
and
extremely
charming
young
man
announce
m
chardon
and
m
le
comte
de
rubempre
before
heiresses
or
english
girls
with
a
million
to
their
fortune
and
note
the
difference
of
the
effect
the
count
might
be
in
debt
but
he
would
find
open
hearts
his
good
looks
brought
into
relief
by
his
title
would
be
like
a
diamond
in
a
rich
setting
chardon
would
not
be
so
much
as
noticed
we
have
not
invented
these
notions
they
are
everywhere
in
the
world
even
among
the
burgeois
you
are
turning
your
back
on
fortune
at
this
minute
do
you
see
that
young
man
he
is
the
vicomte
felix
de
vandenesse
one
of
the
king
s
private
secretaries
the
king
is
fond
enough
of
young
men
of
talent
and
vandenesse
came
from
the
provinces
with
baggage
nearly
as
light
as
yours
you
are
a
thousand
times
cleverer
than
he
but
do
you
belong
to
a
great
family
have
you
a
name
you
know
des
lupeaulx
his
name
is
very
much
like
yours
for
he
was
born
a
chardin
well
he
would
not
sell
his
little
farm
of
lupeaulx
for
a
million
he
will
be
comte
des
lupeaulx
some
day
and
perhaps
his
grandson
may
be
a
you
have
made
a
false
start
and
if
you
continue
in
that
way
it
will
be
all
over
with
you
see
how
much
wiser
emile
blondet
has
been
he
is
engaged
on
a
government
newspaper
he
is
well
looked
on
by
those
in
authority
he
can
afford
to
mix
with
liberals
for
he
holds
sound
opinions
and
soon
or
later
he
will
succeed
but
then
he
understood
how
to
choose
his
opinions
and
his
protectors
your
charming
neighbor
mme
d
espard
glanced
at
mme
de
montcornet
was
a
troisville
there
are
two
peers
of
france
in
the
family
and
two
deputies
she
made
a
wealthy
marriage
with
her
name
she
sees
a
great
deal
of
society
at
her
house
she
has
influence
she
will
move
the
political
world
for
young
blondet
where
will
a
coralie
take
you
in
a
few
years
time
you
will
be
hopelessly
in
debt
and
weary
of
pleasure
you
have
chosen
badly
in
love
and
you
are
arranging
your
life
ill
the
woman
whom
you
delight
to
wound
was
at
the
opera
the
other
night
and
this
was
how
she
spoke
of
you
she
deplored
the
way
in
which
you
were
throwing
away
your
talent
and
the
prime
of
youth
she
was
thinking
of
you
and
not
of
herself
all
the
ah
if
you
were
only
telling
me
the
truth
madame
cried
lucien
what
object
should
i
have
in
telling
lies
returned
the
marquise
with
a
glance
of
cold
disdain
which
annihilated
him
he
was
so
dashed
by
it
that
the
conversation
dropped
for
the
marquise
was
offended
and
said
no
more
lucien
was
nettled
by
her
silence
but
he
felt
that
it
was
due
to
his
own
clumsiness
and
promised
himself
that
he
would
repair
his
error
he
turned
to
mme
de
montcornet
and
talked
to
her
of
blondet
extolling
that
young
writer
for
her
benefit
the
countess
was
gracious
to
him
and
asked
him
at
a
sign
from
mme
d
espard
to
spend
an
evening
at
her
house
it
was
to
be
a
small
and
quiet
gathering
to
which
only
friends
were
invited
mme
de
bargeton
would
be
there
in
spite
of
her
mourning
lucien
would
be
pleased
she
was
sure
to
meet
mme
de
bargeton
mme
la
marquise
says
that
all
the
wrong
is
on
my
side
said
lucien
so
surely
it
rests
with
her
cousin
does
it
not
to
decide
whether
she
will
meet
me
put
an
end
to
those
ridiculous
attacks
which
only
couple
her
name
with
the
name
of
a
man
for
whom
she
does
not
care
at
all
and
you
will
soon
sign
a
treaty
of
peace
you
thought
that
she
had
used
you
ill
i
am
told
but
i
myself
have
seen
her
in
sadness
because
you
had
forsaken
her
is
it
true
that
she
left
the
provinces
on
your
account
lucien
smiled
he
did
not
venture
to
make
any
other
reply
oh
how
could
you
doubt
the
woman
who
made
such
sacrifices
for
you
beautiful
and
intellectual
as
she
is
she
deserves
besides
to
be
loved
for
her
own
sake
and
mme
de
bargeton
cared
less
for
you
than
for
your
talents
believe
me
women
value
intellect
more
than
good
looks
added
the
countess
stealing
a
glance
at
emile
blondet
in
the
minister
s
hotel
lucien
could
see
the
differences
between
the
great
world
and
that
other
world
beyond
the
pale
in
which
he
had
lately
been
living
there
was
no
sort
of
resemblance
between
the
two
kinds
of
splendor
no
single
point
in
common
the
loftiness
and
disposition
of
the
rooms
in
one
of
the
handsomest
houses
in
the
faubourg
the
ancient
gilding
the
breadth
of
decorative
style
the
subdued
richness
of
the
accessories
all
this
was
strange
and
new
to
him
but
lucien
had
learned
very
quickly
to
take
luxury
for
granted
and
he
showed
no
surprise
his
behavior
was
as
far
removed
from
assurance
or
fatuity
on
the
one
hand
as
from
complacency
and
servility
upon
the
other
his
manner
was
good
he
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
all
who
were
not
prepared
to
be
hostile
like
the
younger
men
who
resented
his
sudden
intrusion
into
the
great
world
and
felt
jealous
of
his
good
looks
and
his
success
when
they
rose
from
table
he
offered
his
arm
to
mme
d
espard
and
was
not
refused
rastignac
watching
him
saw
that
the
marquise
was
gracious
to
lucien
and
came
in
the
character
of
a
to
remind
the
poet
that
they
had
met
once
before
at
mme
du
s
the
young
patrician
seemed
anxious
to
find
an
ally
in
the
great
man
from
his
own
province
asked
lucien
to
breakfast
with
him
some
morning
and
offered
to
introduce
him
to
some
young
men
of
fashion
lucien
was
nothing
loath
the
dear
blondet
is
coming
said
rastignac
the
two
were
standing
near
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
the
duc
de
rhetore
de
marsay
and
general
montriveau
the
minister
came
across
to
join
the
group
well
said
he
addressing
lucien
with
a
bluff
german
heartiness
that
concealed
his
dangerous
subtlety
well
so
you
have
made
your
peace
with
mme
d
espard
she
is
delighted
with
you
and
we
all
know
he
added
looking
round
the
group
how
difficult
it
is
to
please
yes
but
she
adores
intellect
said
rastignac
and
my
illustrious
has
wit
enough
to
he
will
soon
find
out
that
he
is
not
doing
well
for
himself
blondet
put
in
briskly
he
will
come
over
he
will
soon
be
one
of
those
who
stood
about
lucien
rang
the
changes
on
this
theme
the
older
and
responsible
men
laid
down
the
law
with
one
or
two
profound
remarks
the
younger
ones
made
merry
at
the
expense
of
the
liberals
he
simply
tossed
up
head
or
tails
for
right
or
left
i
am
sure
remarked
blondet
but
now
he
will
choose
for
lucien
burst
out
laughing
he
thought
of
his
talk
with
lousteau
that
evening
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
he
has
taken
on
a
continued
blondet
one
etienne
lousteau
a
newspaper
hack
who
sees
a
piece
in
a
column
lousteau
s
politics
consist
in
a
belief
that
napoleon
will
return
and
and
this
seems
to
me
to
be
still
more
simple
in
a
confidence
in
the
gratitude
and
patriotism
of
their
worships
the
gentlemen
of
the
left
as
a
rubempre
lucien
s
sympathies
should
lean
towards
the
aristocracy
as
a
journalist
he
ought
to
be
for
authority
or
he
will
never
be
either
rubempre
or
a
the
minister
now
asked
lucien
to
take
a
hand
at
whist
but
to
the
great
astonishment
of
those
present
he
declared
that
he
did
not
know
the
game
come
early
to
me
on
the
day
of
that
breakfast
affair
rastignac
whispered
and
i
will
teach
you
to
play
you
are
a
discredit
to
the
royal
city
of
angouleme
and
to
repeat
de
talleyrand
s
saying
you
are
laying
up
an
unhappy
old
age
for
des
lupeaulx
was
announced
he
remembered
lucien
whom
he
had
met
at
mme
du
s
and
bowed
with
a
semblance
of
friendliness
which
the
poet
could
not
doubt
des
lupeaulx
was
in
favor
he
was
a
master
of
requests
and
did
the
ministry
secret
services
he
was
moreover
cunning
and
ambitious
slipping
himself
in
everywhere
he
was
everybody
s
friend
for
he
never
knew
whom
he
might
need
he
saw
plainly
that
this
was
a
young
journalist
whose
social
success
would
probably
equal
his
success
in
literature
saw
too
that
the
poet
was
ambitious
and
overwhelmed
him
with
protestations
and
expressions
of
friendship
and
interest
till
lucien
felt
as
if
they
were
old
friends
already
and
took
his
promises
and
speeches
for
more
than
their
worth
des
lupeaulx
made
a
point
of
knowing
a
man
thoroughly
well
if
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
or
feared
him
as
a
rival
so
to
all
appearance
lucien
was
well
received
he
knew
that
much
of
his
success
was
owing
to
the
duc
de
rhetore
the
minister
mme
d
espard
and
mme
de
montcornet
and
went
to
spend
a
few
moments
with
the
two
ladies
before
taking
leave
and
talked
his
very
best
for
them
what
a
coxcomb
said
des
lupeaulx
turning
to
the
marquise
when
he
had
gone
he
will
be
rotten
before
he
is
ripe
de
marsay
added
smiling
you
must
have
private
reasons
of
your
own
madame
for
turning
his
head
in
this
when
lucien
stepped
into
the
carriage
in
the
courtyard
he
found
coralie
waiting
for
him
she
had
come
to
fetch
him
the
little
attention
touched
him
he
told
her
the
history
of
his
evening
and
to
his
no
small
astonishment
the
new
notions
which
even
now
were
running
in
his
head
met
with
coralie
s
approval
she
strongly
advised
him
to
enlist
under
the
ministerial
banner
you
have
nothing
to
expect
from
the
liberals
but
hard
knocks
she
said
they
plot
and
conspire
they
murdered
the
duc
de
berri
will
they
upset
the
government
never
you
will
never
come
to
anything
through
them
while
you
will
be
comte
de
rubempre
if
you
throw
in
your
lot
with
the
other
side
you
might
render
services
to
the
state
and
be
a
peer
of
france
and
marry
an
heiress
be
an
ultra
it
is
the
proper
thing
besides
she
added
this
being
the
last
word
with
her
on
all
subjects
i
dined
with
the
she
told
me
that
theodore
gaillard
is
really
going
to
start
his
little
royalist
so
as
to
reply
to
your
witticisms
and
the
jokes
in

hear
them

villele

will
be
in

before
the
year
is
out
try
to
turn
the
change
to
account
before
they
come
to
power
and
say
nothing
to
etienne
and
your
friends
for
they
are
quite
equal
to
playing
you
some
ill
a
week
later
lucien
went
to
mme
de
montcornet
s
house
and
saw
the
woman
whom
he
had
so
loved
whom
later
he
had
stabbed
to
the
heart
with
a
jest
he
felt
the
most
violent
agitation
at
the
sight
of
her
for
louise
also
had
undergone
a
transformation
she
was
the
louise
that
she
would
always
have
been
but
for
her
detention
in
the
provinces
she
was
a
great
lady
there
was
a
grace
and
refinement
in
her
mourning
dress
which
told
that
she
was
a
happy
widow
lucien
fancied
that
this
coquetry
was
aimed
in
some
degree
at
him
and
he
was
right
but
like
an
ogre
he
had
tasted
flesh
and
all
that
evening
he
vacillated
between
coralie
s
warm
voluptuous
beauty
and
the
haughty
cruel
louise
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
sacrifice
the
actress
to
the
great
lady
and
mme
de
bargeton
all
the
old
feeling
reviving
in
her
at
the
sight
of
lucien
lucien
s
beauty
lucien
s
cleverness
was
waiting
and
expecting
that
sacrifice
all
evening
and
after
all
her
insinuating
speeches
and
her
fascinations
she
had
her
trouble
for
her
pains
she
left
the
room
with
a
fixed
determination
to
be
revenged
well
dear
lucien
she
had
said
and
in
her
kindness
there
was
both
generosity
and
parisian
grace
well
dear
lucien
so
you
that
were
to
have
been
my
pride
took
me
for
your
first
victim
and
i
forgave
you
my
dear
for
i
felt
that
in
such
a
revenge
there
was
a
trace
of
love
still
with
that
speech
and
the
queenly
way
in
which
it
was
uttered
mme
de
bargeton
recovered
her
position
lucien
convinced
that
he
was
a
thousand
times
in
the
right
felt
that
he
had
been
put
in
the
wrong
not
one
word
of
the
causes
of
the
rupture
not
one
syllable
of
the
terrible
farewell
letter
a
woman
of
the
world
has
a
wonderful
genius
for
diminishing
her
faults
by
laughing
at
them
she
can
obliterate
them
all
with
a
smile
or
a
question
of
feigned
surprise
and
she
knows
this
she
remembers
nothing
she
can
explain
everything
she
is
amazed
asks
questions
comments
amplifies
and
quarrels
with
you
till
in
the
end
her
sins
disappear
like
stains
on
the
application
of
a
little
soap
and
water
black
as
ink
you
knew
them
to
be
and
lo
in
a
moment
you
behold
immaculate
white
innocence
and
lucky
are
you
if
you
do
not
find
that
you
yourself
have
sinned
in
some
way
beyond
redemption
in
a
moment
old
illusions
regained
their
power
over
lucien
and
louise
they
talked
like
friends
as
before
but
when
the
lady
with
a
hesitating
sigh
put
the
question
are
you
happy
lucien
was
not
ready
with
a
prompt
decided
answer
he
was
intoxicated
with
gratified
vanity
coralie
who
let
us
admit
it
had
made
life
easy
for
him
had
turned
his
head
a
melancholy
no
would
have
made
his
fortune
but
he
must
needs
begin
to
explain
his
position
with
regard
to
coralie
he
said
that
he
was
loved
for
his
own
sake
he
said
a
good
many
foolish
things
that
a
man
will
say
when
he
is
smitten
with
a
tender
passion
and
thought
the
while
that
he
was
doing
a
clever
thing
mme
de

there
was
no
more
to
be
said
mme

brought
mme
de

to
her
cousin
and
lucien
became
the
hero
of
the
evening
so
to
speak
he
was
flattered
petted
and
made
much
of
by
the
three
women
he
was
entangled
with
art
which
no
words
can
describe
his
social
success
in
this
fine
and
brilliant
circle

at

as
great
as
his
triumphs
in

asked
him
to
one
of
her
wednesday
dinners
his
beauty
now
so
justly
famous
seemed
to
have
made
an
impression
upon
her
lucien
exerted
himself
to
show
that
his
wit
equaled
his
good
looks
and
mlle
des

expressed
her
admiration
with
a
playful
outspokenness
and
a
pretty
fervor
of
friendship
which
deceives
those
who
do
not
know
life
in
paris
to
its
depths
nor
suspect
how
continual
enjoyment
whets
the
appetite
for
novelty
if
she
should
like

as
much
as
i
like

we
might
abridge

lucien
addressing

romances
too
well

them
returned

the
charming
young

thirty
years

coralie
is
a
silly
little
fool
my
dear
boy
well
enough
for
a
start
for
a
young
spark
must
have
a
mistress
but
unless
you
make
some
great
conquest
in

an

will
do
you
harm

run

fled
conti

too
well
he
told
des

he
went

who
carried
him
off
to
mme

in

will
you

mme

half
kindly
half
insolent
let
chardon
first
put
himself
in
such
a
position
that
he
will
not
compromise
those
who
take
an
interest
in

she
said
if
he
wishes
to
drop
his
patronymic
and
to
bear
his

he
should
at
any
rate
be
on

they
are
in
waiting
they
will
speak
to
the
chancellor
for
the
diplomatist
and
the
two
women
had
very
soon
discovered
lucien
s
weak
side
the
poet
s
head
was
turned
by
the
glory
of
the
aristocracy
every
man
who
entered
the
rooms
bore
a
sounding
name
mounted
in
a
glittering
title
and
he
himself
was
plain
chardon
unspeakable
mortification
filled
him
at
the
sound
of
it
wherever
he
had
been
during
the
last
few
days
that
pang
had
been
constantly
present
with
him
he
felt
moreover
a
sensation
quite
as
unpleasant
when
he
went
back
to
his
desk
after
an
evening
spent
in
the
great
world
in
which
he
made
a
tolerable
figure
thanks
to
coralie
s
carriage
and
coralie
s
servants
he
learned
to
ride
in
order
to
escort
mme
d
espard
mlle
des
touches
and
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
when
they
drove
in
the
bois
a
privilege
which
he
had
envied
other
young
men
so
greatly
when
he
first
came
to
paris
finot
was
delighted
to
give
his
man
an
order
for
the
opera
so
lucien
wasted
many
an
evening
there
and
thenceforward
he
was
among
the
exquisites
of
the
day
the
poet
asked
rastignac
and
his
new
associates
to
a
breakfast
and
made
the
blunder
of
giving
it
in
coralie
s
rooms
in
the
rue
de
vendome
he
was
too
young
too
much
of
a
poet
too
to
discern
certain
shades
and
distinctions
in
conduct
and
how
should
an
actress
a
but
uneducated
girl
teach
him
life
his
guests
were
anything
but
charitably
disposed
towards
him
it
was
clearly
proven
to
their
minds
that
lucien
the
critic
and
the
actress
were
in
collusion
for
their
mutual
interests
and
all
of
the
young
men
were
jealous
of
an
arrangement
which
all
of
them
stigmatized
the
most
pitiless
of
those
who
laughed
that
evening
at
lucien
s
expense
was
rastignac
himself
rastignac
had
made
and
held
his
position
by
very
similar
means
but
so
careful
had
he
been
of
appearances
that
he
could
afford
to
treat
scandal
as
slander
lucien
proved
an
apt
pupil
at
whist
play
became
a
passion
with
him
and
so
far
from
disapproving
coralie
encouraged
his
extravagance
with
the
peculiar
of
an
love
which
sees
nothing
beyond
the
moment
and
is
ready
to
sacrifice
anything
even
the
future
to
the
present
enjoyment
coralie
looked
on
cards
as
a
against
rivals
a
great
love
has
much
in
common
with
childhood
a
child
s
heedless
careless
spendthrift
ways
a
child
s
laughter
and
tears
in
those
days
there
lived
and
flourished
a
set
of
young
men
some
of
them
rich
some
poor
and
all
of
them
idle
called
and
indeed
they
lived
with
incredible
insolence
unabashed
and
unproductive
consumers
and
yet
more
intrepid
drinkers
these
spendthrifts
mingled
the
roughest
practical
jokes
with
a
life
not
so
much
reckless
as
suicidal
they
drew
back
from
no
impossibility
and
gloried
in
pranks
which
nevertheless
were
confined
within
certain
limits
and
as
they
showed
the
most
original
wit
in
their
escapades
it
was
impossible
not
to
pardon
them
no
sign
of
the
times
more
plainly
discovered
the
helotism
to
which
the
restoration
had
condemned
the
young
manhood
of
the
epoch
the
younger
men
being
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
were
compelled
to
find
other
outlets
for
their
superabundant
energy
besides
journalism
or
conspiracy
or
art
or
letters
they
squandered
their
strength
in
the
wildest
excesses
such
sap
and
luxuriant
power
was
there
in
young
france
the
hard
workers
among
these
gilded
youths
wanted
power
and
pleasure
the
artists
wished
for
money
the
idle
sought
to
stimulate
their
appetites
or
wished
for
excitement
one
and
all
of
them
wanted
a
place
and
one
and
all
were
shut
out
from
politics
and
public
life
nearly
all
the
were
men
of
unusual
mental
powers
some
held
out
against
the
enervating
life
others
were
ruined
by
it
the
most
celebrated
and
the
cleverest
among
them
was
eugene
rastignac
who
entered
with
de
marsay
s
help
upon
a
political
career
in
which
he
has
since
distinguished
himself
the
practical
jokes
in
which
the
set
indulged
became
so
famous
that
not
a
few
vaudevilles
have
been
founded
upon
them
blondet
introduced
lucien
to
this
society
of
prodigals
of
which
he
became
a
brilliant
ornament
ranking
next
to
bixiou
one
of
the
most
mischievous
and
untiring
scoffing
wits
of
his
time
all
through
that
winter
lucien
s
life
was
one
long
fit
of
intoxication
with
intervals
of
easy
work
he
continued
his
series
of
sketches
of
contemporary
life
and
very
occasionally
made
great
efforts
to
write
a
few
pages
of
serious
criticism
on
which
he
brought
his
utmost
power
of
thought
to
bear
but
study
was
the
exception
not
the
rule
and
only
undertaken
at
the
bidding
of
necessity
dinners
and
breakfasts
parties
of
pleasure
and
play
took
up
most
of
his
time
and
coralie
absorbed
all
that
was
left
he
would
not
think
of
the
morrow
he
saw
besides
that
his
friends
were
leading
the
same
life
earning
money
easily
by
writing
publishers
prospectuses
and
articles
paid
for
by
speculators
all
of
them
lived
beyond
their
incomes
none
of
them
thought
seriously
of
the
future
lucien
had
been
admitted
into
the
ranks
of
journalism
and
of
literature
on
terms
of
equality
he
foresaw
immense
difficulties
in
the
way
if
he
should
try
to
rise
above
the
rest
every
one
was
willing
to
look
upon
him
as
an
equal
no
one
would
have
him
for
a
superior
unconsciously
he
gave
up
the
idea
of
winning
fame
in
literature
for
it
seemed
easier
to
gain
success
in
politics
intrigue
raises
less
opposition
than
talent
du
chatelet
had
said
one
day
for
lucien
and
the
baron
had
made
up
their
quarrel
a
plot
below
the
surface
rouses
no
one
s
attention
intrigue
moreover
is
superior
to
talent
for
it
makes
something
out
of
nothing
while
for
the
most
part
the
immense
resources
of
talent
only
injure
a
so
lucien
never
lost
sight
of
his
principal
idea
and
though
following
close
upon
the
heels
of
in
the
midst
of
an
orgy
never
found
the
promised
work
accomplished
lucien
was
assiduous
in
society
he
paid
court
to
mme
de
bargeton
the
marquise
d
espard
and
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
he
never
missed
a
single
party
given
by
mlle
des
touches
appearing
in
society
after
a
dinner
given
by
authors
or
publishers
and
leaving
the
salons
for
a
supper
given
in
consequence
of
a
bet
the
demands
of
conversation
and
the
excitement
of
play
absorbed
all
the
ideas
and
energy
left
by
excess
the
poet
had
lost
the
lucidity
of
judgment
and
coolness
of
head
which
must
be
preserved
if
a
man
is
to
see
all
that
is
going
on
around
him
and
never
to
lose
the
exquisite
tact
which
the
needs
at
every
moment
how
should
he
know
how
many
a
time
mme
de
bargeton
left
him
with
wounded
susceptibilities
how
often
she
forgave
him
or
added
one
more
condemnation
to
the
rest
chatelet
saw
that
his
rival
had
still
a
chance
left
so
he
became
lucien
s
friend
he
encouraged
the
poet
in
dissipation
that
wasted
his
energies
rastignac
jealous
of
his
and
thinking
besides
that
chatelet
would
be
a
surer
and
more
useful
ally
than
lucien
had
taken
up
the
baron
s
cause
so
some
few
days
after
the
meeting
of
the
petrarch
and
laura
of
angouleme
rastignac
brought
about
the
reconciliation
between
the
poet
and
the
elderly
beau
at
a
sumptuous
supper
given
at
the
de
lucien
never
returned
home
till
morning
and
rose
in
the
middle
of
the
day
coralie
was
always
at
his
side
he
could
not
forego
a
single
pleasure
sometimes
he
saw
his
real
position
and
made
good
resolutions
but
they
came
to
nothing
in
his
idle
easy
life
and
the
mainspring
of
will
grew
slack
and
only
responded
to
the
heaviest
pressure
of
necessity
coralie
had
been
glad
that
lucien
should
amuse
himself
she
had
encouraged
him
in
this
reckless
expenditure
because
she
thought
that
the
cravings
which
she
fostered
would
bind
her
lover
to
her
but
and
loving
as
she
was
she
found
courage
to
advise
lucien
not
to
forget
his
work
and
once
or
twice
was
obliged
to
remind
him
that
he
had
earned
very
little
during
the
month
their
debts
were
growing
frightfully
fast
the
fifteen
hundred
francs
which
remained
from
the
of
the
had
been
swallowed
up
at
once
together
with
lucien
s
first
five
hundred
livres
in
three
months
he
had
only
made
a
thousand
francs
yet
he
felt
as
though
he
had
been
working
tremendously
hard
but
by
this
time
lucien
had
adopted
the
pleasant
theory
of
debts
debts
are
becoming
to
a
young
man
but
after
the
age
of
they
are
inexcusable
it
should
be
observed
that
there
are
certain
natures
in
which
a
really
poetic
temper
is
united
with
a
weakened
will
and
these
while
absorbed
in
feeling
that
they
may
transmute
personal
experience
sensation
or
impression
into
some
permanent
form
are
essentially
deficient
in
the
moral
sense
which
should
accompany
all
observation
poets
prefer
rather
to
receive
their
own
impressions
than
to
enter
into
the
souls
of
others
to
study
the
mechanism
of
their
feelings
and
thoughts
so
lucien
neither
asked
his
associates
what
became
of
those
who
disappeared
from
among
them
nor
looked
into
the
futures
of
his
friends
some
of
them
were
heirs
to
property
others
had
definite
expectations
yet
others
either
possessed
names
that
were
known
in
the
world
or
a
most
robust
belief
in
their
destiny
and
a
fixed
resolution
to
circumvent
the
law
lucien
too
believed
in
his
future
on
the
strength
of
various
profound
axiomatic
sayings
of
blondet
s
everything
comes
out
all
right
at
last
if
a
man
has
nothing
his
affairs
can
not
be
embarrassed
we
have
nothing
to
lose
but
the
fortune
that
we
seek
swim
with
the
stream
it
will
take
you
somewhere
a
clever
man
with
a
footing
in
society
can
make
a
fortune
whenever
he
that
winter
filled
as
it
was
with
so
many
pleasures
and
dissipations
was
a
necessary
interval
employed
in
finding
capital
for
the
new
royalist
paper
theodore
gaillard
and
hector
merlin
only
brought
out
the
first
number
of
the
in
march
the
affair
had
been
settled
at
mme
du
s
house
mme
du
exercised
a
certain
influence
over
the
great
personages
royalist
writers
and
bankers
who
met
in
her
splendid
rooms
fit
for
a
tale
out
of
the
as
the
elegant
and
clever
courtesan
herself
used
to
say
to
transact
business
which
could
not
be
arranged
elsewhere
the
editorship
had
been
promised
to
hector
merlin
lucien
merlin
s
intimate
was
pretty
certain
to
be
his
man
and
a
in
a
ministerial
paper
had
been
promised
to
him
besides
all
through
the
dissipations
of
that
winter
lucien
had
been
secretly
making
ready
for
this
change
of
front
child
as
he
was
he
fancied
that
he
was
a
deep
politician
because
he
concealed
the
preparation
for
the
approaching
while
he
was
counting
upon
ministerial
largesses
to
extricate
himself
from
embarrassment
and
to
lighten
coralie
s
secret
cares
coralie
said
nothing
of
her
distress
she
smiled
now
as
always
but
berenice
was
bolder
she
kept
lucien
informed
of
their
difficulties
and
the
budding
great
man
moved
after
the
fashion
of
poets
by
the
tale
of
disasters
would
vow
that
he
would
begin
to
work
in
earnest
and
then
forget
his
resolution
and
drown
his
fleeting
cares
in
excess
one
day
coralie
saw
the
poetic
brow
overcast
and
scolded
berenice
and
told
her
lover
that
everything
would
be
settled
mme
d
espard
and
mme
de
bargeton
were
waiting
for
lucien
s
profession
of
his
new
creed
so
they
said
before
applying
through
chatelet
for
the
patent
which
should
permit
lucien
to
bear
the
desired
name
lucien
had
proposed
to
dedicate
the
to
mme
d
espard
and
the
marquise
seemed
to
be
not
a
little
flattered
by
a
compliment
which
authors
have
been
somewhat
chary
of
paying
since
they
became
a
power
in
the
land
but
when
lucien
went
to
dauriat
and
asked
after
his
book
that
worthy
publisher
met
him
with
excellent
reasons
for
the
delay
in
its
appearance
dauriat
had
this
and
that
in
hand
which
took
up
all
his
time
a
new
volume
by
canalis
was
coming
out
and
he
did
not
want
the
two
books
to
clash
de
lamartine
s
second
series
of
was
in
the
press
and
two
important
collections
of
poetry
ought
not
to
appear
together
by
this
time
however
lucien
s
needs
were
so
pressing
that
he
had
recourse
to
finot
and
received
an
advance
on
his
work
when
at
a
that
evening
the
poet
journalist
explained
his
position
to
his
friends
in
the
fast
set
they
drowned
his
scruples
in
champagne
iced
with
pleasantries
debts
there
was
never
yet
a
man
of
any
power
without
debts
debts
represented
satisfied
cravings
clamorous
vices
a
man
only
succeeds
under
the
pressure
of
the
iron
hand
of
necessity
debts
forsooth
why
the
one
pledge
of
which
a
great
man
can
be
sure
is
given
him
by
his
friend
the
pawnbroker
cried
blondet
if
you
want
everything
you
must
owe
for
everything
called
bixiou
no
corrected
des
lupeaulx
if
you
owe
for
everything
you
have
had
the
party
contrived
to
convince
the
novice
that
his
debts
were
a
golden
spur
to
urge
on
the
horses
of
the
chariot
of
his
fortunes
there
is
always
the
stock
example
of
julius
caesar
with
his
debt
of
forty
millions
and
friedrich
ii
on
an
allowance
of
one
ducat
a
month
and
a
host
of
other
great
men
whose
failings
are
held
up
for
the
corruption
of
youth
while
not
a
word
is
said
of
their
ideas
their
courage
equal
to
all
odds
creditors
seized
coralie
s
horses
carriage
and
furniture
at
last
for
an
amount
of
four
thousand
francs
lucien
went
to
lousteau
and
asked
his
friend
to
meet
his
bill
for
the
thousand
francs
lent
to
pay
gaming
debts
but
lousteau
showed
him
certain
pieces
of
stamped
paper
which
proved
that
florine
was
in
much
the
same
case
lousteau
was
grateful
however
and
offered
to
take
the
necessary
steps
for
the
sale
of
lucien
s
of
charles
how
came
florine
to
be
in
this
plight
asked
lucien
the
matifat
took
alarm
said
lousteau
we
have
lost
him
but
if
florine
chooses
she
can
make
him
pay
dear
for
his
treachery
i
will
tell
you
all
about
three
days
after
this
bootless
errand
lucien
and
coralie
were
breakfasting
in
melancholy
spirits
beside
the
fire
in
their
pretty
bedroom
berenice
had
cooked
a
dish
of
eggs
for
them
over
the
grate
for
the
cook
had
gone
and
the
coachman
and
servants
had
taken
leave
they
could
not
sell
the
furniture
for
it
had
been
attached
there
was
not
a
single
object
of
any
value
in
the
house
a
goodly
collection
of
pawntickets
forming
a
very
instructive
octavo
volume
represented
all
the
gold
silver
and
jewelry
berenice
had
kept
back
a
couple
of
spoons
and
forks
that
was
all
lousteau
s
newspaper
was
of
service
now
to
coralie
and
lucien
little
as
they
suspected
it
for
the
tailor
dressmaker
and
milliner
were
afraid
to
meddle
with
a
journalist
who
was
quite
capable
of
writing
down
their
establishments
etienne
lousteau
broke
in
upon
their
breakfast
with
a
shout
of
hurrah
long
live
archer
of
charles
and
i
have
converted
a
hundred
francs
worth
of
books
into
cash
children
we
will
go
he
handed
fifty
francs
to
coralie
and
sent
berenice
out
in
quest
of
a
more
substantial
breakfast
hector
merlin
and
i
went
to
a
booksellers
trade
dinner
yesterday
and
prepared
the
way
for
your
romance
with
cunning
insinuations
dauriat
is
in
treaty
but
dauriat
is
haggling
over
it
he
won
t
give
more
than
four
thousand
francs
for
two
thousand
copies
and
you
want
six
thousand
francs
we
made
you
out
twice
as
great
as
sir
walter
scott
oh
you
have
such
novels
as
never
were
in
the
inwards
of
you
it
is
not
a
mere
book
for
sale
it
is
a
big
business
you
are
not
simply
the
writer
of
one
more
or
less
ingenious
novel
you
are
going
to
write
a
whole
series
the
word
series
did
it
so
mind
you
don
t
forget
that
you
have
a
great
historical
series
on
hand
grande
or
france
of
louis
or
early
days
of
louis
queen
and
the
or
and
the
son
of
the
or
s
these
novels
will
be
announced
on
the
wrapper
of
the
book
we
call
this
manoeuvre
giving
a
success
a
toss
in
the
coverlet
for
the
titles
are
all
to
appear
on
the
cover
till
you
will
be
better
known
for
the
books
that
you
have
not
written
than
for
the
work
you
have
done
and
in
the
press
is
a
way
of
gaining
credit
in
advance
for
work
that
you
will
do
come
now
let
us
have
a
little
fun
here
comes
the
champagne
you
can
understand
lucien
that
our
men
opened
eyes
as
big
as
saucers
by
the
by
i
see
that
you
have
saucers
still
they
are
attached
explained
coralie
i
understand
and
i
resume
show
a
publisher
one
manuscript
volume
and
he
will
believe
in
all
the
rest
a
publisher
asks
to
see
your
manuscript
and
gives
you
to
understand
that
he
is
going
to
read
it
why
disturb
his
harmless
vanity
they
never
read
a
manuscript
they
would
not
publish
so
many
if
they
did
well
hector
and
i
allowed
it
to
leak
out
that
you
might
consider
an
offer
of
five
thousand
francs
for
three
thousand
copies
in
two
editions
let
me
have
your
the
day
after
we
are
to
breakfast
with
the
publishers
and
we
will
get
the
upper
hand
of
who
are
they
asked
lucien
two
partners
named
fendant
and
cavalier
they
are
two
good
fellows
pretty
straightforward
in
business
one
of
them
used
to
be
with
vidal
and
porchon
the
other
is
the
cleverest
hand
on
the
quai
des
augustins
they
only
started
in
business
last
year
and
have
lost
a
little
on
translations
of
english
novels
so
now
my
gentlemen
have
a
mind
to
exploit
the
native
product
there
is
a
rumor
current
that
those
dealers
in
spoiled
white
paper
are
trading
on
other
people
s
capital
but
i
don
t
think
it
matters
very
much
to
you
who
finds
the
money
so
long
as
you
are
two
days
later
the
pair
went
to
a
breakfast
in
the
rue
serpente
in
lucien
s
old
quarter
of
paris
lousteau
still
kept
his
room
in
the
rue
de
la
harpe
and
it
was
in
the
same
state
as
before
but
this
time
lucien
felt
no
surprise
he
had
been
initiated
into
the
life
of
journalism
he
knew
all
its
ups
and
downs
since
that
evening
of
his
introduction
to
the
wooden
galleries
he
had
been
paid
for
many
an
article
and
gambled
away
the
money
along
with
the
desire
to
write
he
had
filled
columns
not
once
but
many
times
in
the
ingenious
ways
described
by
lousteau
on
that
memorable
evening
as
they
went
to
the
palais
royal
he
was
dependent
upon
barbet
and
braulard
he
trafficked
in
books
and
he
shrank
no
longer
from
any
attack
from
writing
any
panegyric
and
at
this
moment
he
was
in
some
sort
rejoicing
to
make
all
he
could
out
of
lousteau
before
turning
his
back
on
the
liberals
his
intimate
knowledge
of
the
party
would
stand
him
in
good
stead
in
future
and
lousteau
on
his
side
was
privately
receiving
five
hundred
francs
of
under
the
name
of
commission
from
fendant
and
cavalier
for
introducing
the
future
sir
walter
scott
to
two
enterprising
tradesmen
in
search
of
a
french
author
of
the
firm
of
fendant
and
cavalier
had
started
in
business
without
any
capital
whatsoever
a
great
many
publishing
houses
were
established
at
that
time
in
the
same
way
and
are
likely
to
be
established
so
long
as
papermakers
and
printers
will
give
credit
for
the
time
required
to
play
some
seven
or
eight
of
the
games
of
chance
called
new
at
that
time
as
at
present
the
author
s
copyright
was
paid
for
in
bills
at
six
nine
and
twelve
months
a
method
of
payment
determined
by
the
custom
of
the
trade
for
booksellers
settle
accounts
between
themselves
by
bills
at
even
longer
dates
papermakers
and
printers
are
paid
in
the
same
way
so
that
in
practice
the
has
a
dozen
or
a
score
of
works
on
sale
for
a
twelvemonth
before
he
pays
for
them
even
if
only
two
or
three
of
these
hit
the
public
taste
the
profitable
speculations
pay
for
the
bad
and
the
publisher
pays
his
way
by
grafting
as
it
were
one
book
upon
another
but
if
all
of
them
turn
out
badly
or
if
for
his
misfortune
the
happens
to
bring
out
some
really
good
literature
which
stays
on
hand
until
the
right
public
discovers
and
appreciates
it
or
if
it
costs
too
much
to
discount
the
paper
that
he
receives
then
resignedly
he
files
his
schedule
and
becomes
a
bankrupt
with
an
untroubled
mind
he
was
prepared
all
along
for
something
of
the
kind
so
all
the
chances
being
in
favor
of
the
publishers
they
staked
other
people
s
money
not
their
own
upon
the
of
business
speculation
this
was
the
case
with
fendant
and
cavalier
cavalier
brought
his
experience
fendant
his
industry
the
capital
was
a
affair
and
very
accurately
described
by
that
word
for
it
consisted
in
a
few
thousand
francs
scraped
together
with
difficulty
by
the
mistresses
of
the
pair
out
of
this
fund
they
allowed
each
other
a
fairly
handsome
salary
and
scrupulously
spent
it
all
in
dinners
to
journalists
and
authors
or
at
the
theatre
where
their
business
was
transacted
as
they
said
this
questionably
honest
couple
were
both
supposed
to
be
clever
men
of
business
but
fendant
was
more
slippery
than
cavalier
cavalier
true
to
his
name
traveled
about
fendant
looked
after
business
in
paris
a
partnership
between
two
publishers
is
always
more
or
less
of
a
duel
and
so
it
was
with
fendant
and
cavalier
they
had
brought
out
plenty
of
romances
already
such
as
the
du
marchand
de
fontaine
du
and
translations
of
the
works
of
galt
an
english
novelist
who
never
attained
much
popularity
in
france
the
success
of
translations
of
scott
had
called
the
attention
of
the
trade
to
english
novels
the
race
of
publishers
all
agog
for
a
second
norman
conquest
were
seeking
industriously
for
a
second
scott
just
as
at
a
rather
later
day
every
one
must
needs
look
for
asphalt
in
stony
soil
or
bitumen
in
marshes
and
speculate
in
projected
railways
the
stupidity
of
the
paris
commercial
world
is
conspicuous
in
these
attempts
to
do
the
same
thing
twice
for
success
lies
in
contraries
and
in
paris
of
all
places
in
the
world
success
spoils
success
so
beneath
the
title
of
or
russia
a
hundred
years
fendant
and
cavalier
rashly
added
in
big
letters
the
words
in
the
style
of
fendant
and
cavalier
were
in
great
need
of
a
success
a
single
good
book
might
float
their
sunken
bales
they
thought
and
there
was
the
alluring
prospect
besides
of
articles
in
the
newspapers
the
great
way
of
promoting
sales
in
those
days
a
book
is
very
seldom
bought
and
sold
for
its
just
value
and
purchases
are
determined
by
considerations
quite
other
than
the
merits
of
the
work
so
fendant
and
cavalier
thought
of
lucien
as
a
journalist
and
of
his
book
as
a
salable
article
which
would
help
them
to
tide
over
their
monthly
settlement
the
partners
occupied
the
ground
floor
of
one
of
the
great
houses
in
the
rue
serpente
their
private
office
had
been
contrived
at
the
further
end
of
a
suite
of
large
now
converted
into
warehouses
for
books
lucien
and
etienne
found
the
publishers
in
their
office
the
agreement
drawn
up
and
the
bills
ready
lucien
wondered
at
such
prompt
action
fendant
was
short
and
thin
and
by
no
means
reassuring
of
aspect
with
his
low
narrow
forehead
sunken
nose
and
hard
mouth
he
looked
like
a
kalmuck
tartar
a
pair
of
small
black
eyes
the
crabbed
irregular
outline
of
his
countenance
a
voice
like
a
cracked
bell
the
man
s
whole
appearance
in
fact
combined
to
give
the
impression
that
this
was
a
consummate
rascal
a
honeyed
tongue
compensated
for
these
disadvantages
and
he
gained
his
ends
by
talk
cavalier
a
stout
young
fellow
looked
more
like
the
driver
of

coach

a
publisher
he
had
hair
of
a
sandy
color
a
fiery
red
countenance
and
the
heavy
build
and
untiring
tongue
of
a
commercial
traveler
there
is
no
need
to
discuss
this
affair
said
fendant
addressing
lucien
and
lousteau
i
have
read
the
work
it
is
very
literary
and
so
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
we
want
that
i
have
sent
it
off
as
it
is
to
the
printer
the
agreement
is
drawn
on
the
lines
laid
down
and
besides
we
always
make
the
same
stipulations
in
all
cases
the
bills
fall
due
in
six
nine
and
twelve
months
respectively
you
will
meet
with
no
difficulty
in
discounting
them
and
we
will
refund
you
the
discount
we
have
reserved
the
right
of
giving
a
new
title
to
the
book
we
don
t
care
for
archer
of
charles
it
doesn
t
tickle
the
reader
s
curiosity
sufficiently
there
were
several
kings
of
that
name
you
see
and
there
were
so
many
archers
in
the
middle
ages
if
you
had
only
called
it
the
of
now
but
archer
of
charles
why
cavalier
would
have
to
give
a
course
of
history
lessons
before
he
could
place
a
copy
anywhere
in
the
if
you
but
knew
the
class
of
people
that
we
have
to
do
with
exclaimed
cavalier
would
suit
better
continued
fendant
de
medici
or
france
under
charles
would
sound
more
like
one
of
scott
s
novels
added
cavalier
we
will
settle
it
when
the
work
is
printed
said
fendant
do
as
you
please
so
long
as
i
approve
your
title
said
lucien
the
agreement
was
read
over
signed
in
duplicate
and
each
of
the
contracting
parties
took
their
copy
lucien
put
the
bills
in
his
pocket
with
unequaled
satisfaction
and
the
four
repaired
to
fendant
s
abode
where
they
breakfasted
on
beefsteaks
and
oysters
kidneys
in
champagne
and
brie
cheese
but
if
the
fare
was
something
of
the
homeliest
the
wines
were
exquisite
cavalier
had
an
acquaintance
a
traveler
in
the
wine
trade
just
as
they
sat
down
to
table
the
printer
appeared
to
lucien
s
surprise
with
the
first
two
we
want
to
get
on
with
it
fendant
said
we
are
counting
on
your
book
we
want
a
success
confoundedly
the
breakfast
begun
at
noon
lasted
till
five
o
clock
where
shall
we
get
cash
for
these
things
asked
lucien
as
they
came
away
somewhat
heated
and
flushed
with
the
wine
we
might
try
barbet
suggested
etienne
and
they
turned
down
to
the
quai
des
augustins
coralie
is
astonished
to
the
highest
degree
over
florine
s
loss
florine
only
told
her
about
it
yesterday
she
seemed
to
lay
the
blame
of
it
on
you
and
was
so
vexed
that
she
was
ready
to
throw
you
that
s
true
said
lousteau
wine
had
got
the
better
of
prudence
and
he
unbosomed
himself
to
lucien
ending
up
with
my
friend
for
you
are
my
friend
lucien
you
lent
me
a
thousand
francs
and
you
have
only
once
asked
me
for
the
money
shun
play
if
i
had
never
touched
a
card
i
should
be
a
happy
man
i
owe
money
all
round
at
this
moment
i
have
the
bailiffs
at
my
heels
indeed
when
i
go
to
the
palais
royal
i
have
dangerous
capes
to
in
the
language
of
the
fast
set
doubling
a
cape
meant
dodging
a
creditor
or
keeping
out
of
his
way
lucien
had
not
heard
the
expression
before
but
he
was
familiar
with
the
practice
by
this
time
are
your
debts
so
heavy
a
mere
trifle
said
lousteau
a
thousand
crowns
would
pull
me
through
i
have
resolved
to
turn
steady
and
give
up
play
and
i
have
done
a
little
chantage
to
pay
my
what
is
chantage
asked
lucien
it
is
an
english
invention
recently
imported
a
chanteur
is
a
man
who
can
manage
to
put
a
paragraph
in
the
papers
never
an
editor
nor
a
responsible
man
for
they
are
not
supposed
to
know
anything
about
it
and
there
is
always
a
giroudeau
or
a
philippe
bridau
to
be
found
a
bravo
of
this
stamp
finds
up
somebody
who
has
his
own
reasons
for
not
wanting
to
be
talked
about
plenty
of
people
have
a
few
peccadilloes
or
some
more
or
less
original
sin
upon
their
consciences
there
are
plenty
of
fortunes
made
in
ways
that
would
not
bear
looking
into
sometimes
a
man
has
kept
the
letter
of
the
law
and
sometimes
he
has
not
and
in
either
case
there
is
a
tidbit
of
tattle
for
the
inquirer
as
for
instance
that
tale
of
fouche
s
police
surrounding
the
spies
of
the
prefect
of
police
who
not
being
in
the
secret
of
the
fabrication
of
forged
english
banknotes
were
just
about
to
pounce
on
the
clandestine
printers
employed
by
the
minister
or
there
is
the
story
of
prince
galathionne
s
diamonds
the
maubreuile
affair
or
the
pombreton
will
case
the
chanteur
gets
possession
of
some
compromising
letter
asks
for
an
interview
and
if
the
man
that
made
the
money
does
not
buy
silence
the
chanteur
draws
a
picture
of
the
press
ready
to
take
the
matter
up
and
unravel
his
private
affairs
the
rich
man
is
frightened
he
comes
down
with
the
money
and
the
trick
succeeds
you
are
committed
to
some
risky
venture
which
might
easily
be
written
down
in
a
series
of
articles
a
chanteur
waits
upon
you
and
offers
to
withdraw
the
articles
for
a
consideration
chanteurs
are
sent
to
men
in
office
who
will
bargain
that
their
acts
and
not
their
private
characters
are
to
be
attacked
or
they
are
heedless
of
their
characters
and
anxious
only
to
shield
the
woman
they
love
one
of
your
acquaintance
that
charming
master
of
requests
des
lupeaulx
is
a
kind
of
agent
for
affairs
of
this
sort
the
rascal
has
made
a
position
for
himself
in
the
most
marvelous
way
in
the
very
centre
of
power
he
is
the
of
the
press
and
the
ambassador
of
the
ministers
he
works
upon
a
man
s
he
bribes
newspapers
to
pass
over
a
loan
in
silence
or
to
make
no
comment
on
a
contract
which
was
never
put
up
for
public
tender
and
the
jackals
of
liberal
bankers
get
a
share
out
of
it
that
was
a
bit
of
chantage
that
you
did
with
dauriat
he
gave
you
a
thousand
crowns
to
let
nathan
alone
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
journalism
was
still
in
its
infancy
this
kind
of
blackmail
was
levied
by
pamphleteers
in
the
pay
of
favorites
and
great
lords
the
original
inventor
was
pietro
aretino
a
great
italian
kings
went
in
fear
of
him
as
go
in
fear
of
a
newspaper
what
did
you
do
to
the
matifat
to
make
the
thousand
crowns
i
attacked
florine
in
half
a
dozen
papers
florine
complained
to
matifat
matifat
went
to
braulard
to
find
out
what
the
attacks
meant
i
did
my
chantage
for
finot
s
benefit
and
finot
put
braulard
on
the
wrong
scent
braulard
told
the
man
of
drugs
that
were
demolishing
florine
in
coralie
s
interest
then
giroudeau
went
round
to
matifat
and
told
him
in
confidence
that
the
whole
business
could
be
accommodated
if
he
matifat
would
consent
to
sell
his
sixth
share
in
finot
s
review
for
ten
thousand
francs
finot
was
to
give
me
a
thousand
crowns
if
the
dodge
succeeded
well
matifat
was
only
too
glad
to
get
back
ten
thousand
francs
out
of
the
thirty
thousand
invested
in
a
risky
speculation
as
he
thought
for
florine
had
been
telling
him
for
several
days
past
that
finot
s
review
was
doing
badly
and
instead
of
paying
a
dividend
something
was
said
of
calling
up
more
capital
so
matifat
was
just
about
to
close
with
the
offer
when
the
manager
of
the
comes
to
him
with
some
accommodation
bills
that
he
wanted
to
negotiate
before
filing
his
schedule
to
induce
matifat
to
take
them
of
him
he
let
out
a
word
of
finot
s
trick
matifat
being
a
shrewd
man
of
business
took
the
hint
held
tight
to
his
sixth
and
is
laughing
in
his
sleeve
at
us
finot
and
i
are
howling
with
despair
we
have
been
so
misguided
as
to
attack
a
man
who
has
no
affection
for
his
mistress
a
heartless
soulless
wretch
unluckily
too
for
us
matifat
s
business
is
not
amenable
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
press
and
he
can
not
be
made
to
smart
for
it
through
his
interests
a
druggist
is
not
like
a
hatter
or
a
milliner
or
a
theatre
or
a
work
of
art
he
is
above
criticism
you
can
t
run
down
his
opium
and
dyewoods
nor
cocoa
beans
paint
and
pepper
florine
is
at
her
wits
end
the
panorama
closes
and
what
will
become
of
her
she
does
not
coralie
s
engagement
at
the
gymnase
begins
in
a
few
days
said
lucien
she
might
do
something
for
not
she
said
lousteau
coralie
is
not
clever
but
she
is
not
quite
simple
enough
to
help
herself
to
a
rival
we
are
in
a
mess
with
a
vengeance
and
finot
is
in
such
a
hurry
to
buy
back
his
sixth
why
it
is
a
capital
bit
of
business
my
dear
fellow
there
is
a
chance
of
selling
the
paper
for
three
hundred
thousand
francs
finot
would
have
and
his
partners
besides
are
going
to
pay
him
a
commission
which
he
will
share
with
des
lupeaulx
so
i
propose
to
do
another
turn
of
chantage
seems
to
mean
your
money
or
your
life
it
is
better
than
that
said
lousteau
it
is
your
money
or
your
character
a
short
time
ago
the
proprietor
of
a
minor
newspaper
was
refused
credit
the
day
before
yesterday
it
was
announced
in
his
columns
that
a
gold
repeater
set
with
diamonds
belonging
to
a
certain
notability
had
found
its
way
in
a
curious
fashion
into
the
hands
of
a
private
soldier
in
the
guards
the
story
promised
to
the
readers
might
have
come
from
the
the
notability
lost
no
time
in
asking
that
editor
to
dine
with
him
the
editor
was
distinctly
a
gainer
by
the
transaction
and
contemporary
history
has
lost
an
anecdote
whenever
the
press
makes
vehement
onslaughts
upon
some
one
in
power
you
may
be
sure
that
there
is
some
refusal
to
do
a
service
behind
it
blackmailing
with
regard
to
private
life
is
the
terror
of
the
richest
englishman
and
a
great
source
of
wealth
to
the
press
in
england
which
is
infinitely
more
corrupt
than
ours
we
are
children
in
comparison
in
england
they
will
pay
five
or
six
thousand
francs
for
a
compromising
letter
to
sell
then
how
can
you
lay
hold
of
matifat
asked
lucien
my
dear
boy
that
low
tradesman
wrote
the
queerest
letters
to
florine
the
spelling
style
and
matter
of
them
is
ludicrous
to
the
last
degree
we
can
strike
him
in
the
very
midst
of
his
lares
and
penates
where
he
feels
himself
safest
without
so
much
as
mentioning
his
name
and
he
can
not
complain
for
he
lives
in
fear
and
terror
of
his
wife
imagine
his
wrath
when
he
sees
the
first
number
of
a
little
serial
entitled
the
of
a
and
is
given
fair
warning
that
his
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
certain
journalists
he
talks
about
the
little
god
cupid
he
tells
florine
that
she
enables
him
to
cross
the
desert
of
life
which
looks
as
if
he
took
her
for
a
camel
and
spells
never
with
two
v
s
there
is
enough
in
that
immensely
funny
correspondence
to
bring
an
influx
of
subscribers
for
a
fortnight
he
will
shake
in
his
shoes
lest
an
anonymous
letter
should
supply
his
wife
with
the
key
to
the
riddle
the
question
is
whether
florine
will
consent
to
appear
to
persecute
matifat
she
has
some
principles
which
is
to
say
some
hopes
still
left
perhaps
she
means
to
keep
the
letters
and
make
something
for
herself
out
of
them
she
is
cunning
as
befits
my
pupil
but
as
soon
as
she
finds
out
that
a
bailiff
is
no
laughing
matter
or
finot
gives
her
a
suitable
present
or
hopes
of
an
engagement
she
will
give
me
the
letters
and
i
will
sell
them
to
finot
finot
will
put
the
correspondence
in
his
uncle
s
hands
and
giroudeau
will
bring
matifat
to
these
confidences
sobered
lucien
his
first
thought
was
that
he
had
some
extremely
dangerous
friends
his
second
that
it
would
be
impolitic
to
break
with
them
for
if
mme
d
espard
mme
de
bargeton
and
chatelet
should
fail
to
keep
their
word
with
him
he
might
need
their
terrible
power
yet
by
this
time
etienne
and
lucien
had
reached
barbet
s
miserable
bookshop
on
the
quai
etienne
addressed
barbet
we
have
five
thousand
francs
worth
of
bills
at
six
nine
and
twelve
months
given
by
fendant
and
cavalier
are
you
willing
to
discount
them
for
us
i
will
give
you
three
thousand
francs
for
them
said
barbet
with
imperturbable
coolness
three
thousand
francs
echoed
lucien
nobody
else
will
give
you
as
much
rejoined
the
bookseller
the
firm
will
go
bankrupt
before
three
months
are
out
but
i
happen
to
know
that
they
have
some
good
books
that
are
hanging
on
hand
they
can
not
afford
to
wait
so
i
shall
buy
their
stock
for
cash
and
pay
them
with
their
own
bills
and
get
the
books
at
a
reduction
of
two
thousand
francs
that
s
how
it
do
you
mind
losing
a
couple
of
thousand
francs
lucien
asked
lousteau
yes
lucien
answered
vehemently
he
was
dismayed
by
this
first
rebuff
you
are
making
a
mistake
said
etienne
you
won
t
find
any
one
that
will
take
their
paper
said
barbet
your
book
is
their
last
stake
sir
the
printer
will
not
trust
them
they
are
obliged
to
leave
the
copies
in
pawn
with
him
if
they
make
a
hit
now
it
will
only
stave
off
bankruptcy
for
another
six
months
sooner
or
later
they
will
have
to
go
they
are
cleverer
at
tippling
than
at
bookselling
in
my
own
case
their
bills
mean
business
and
that
being
so
i
can
afford
to
give
more
than
a
professional
discounter
who
simply
looks
at
the
signatures
it
is
a
s
business
to
know
whether
the
three
names
on
a
bill
are
each
good
for
thirty
per
cent
in
case
of
bankruptcy
and
here
at
the
outset
you
only
offer
two
signatures
and
neither
of
them
worth
ten
per
the
two
journalists
exchanged
glances
in
surprise
here
was
a
little
scrub
of
a
bookseller
putting
the
essence
of
the
art
and
mystery
of
in
these
few
words
that
will
do
barbet
said
lousteau
can
you
tell
us
of
a
that
will
look
at
us
there
is
daddy
chaboisseau
on
the
quai
you
know
he
tided
fendant
over
his
last
monthly
settlement
if
you
won
t
listen
to
my
offer
you
might
go
and
see
what
he
says
to
you
but
you
would
only
come
back
to
me
and
then
i
shall
offer
you
two
thousand
francs
instead
of
etienne
and
lucien
betook
themselves
to
the
quai
and
found
chaboisseau
in
a
little
house
with
a
passage
entry
chaboisseau
a
whose
dealings
were
principally
with
the
book
trade
lived
in
a
lodging
furnished
in
the
most
eccentric
manner
a
banker
and
millionaire
to
boot
he
had
a
taste
for
the
classical
style
the
cornice
was
in
the
classical
style
the
bedstead
in
the
purest
classical
taste
dated
from
the
time
of
the
empire
when
such
things
were
in
fashion
the
purple
hangings
fell
over
the
wall
like
the
classic
draperies
in
the
background
of
one
of
david
s
pictures
chairs
and
tables
lamps
and
sconces
and
every
least
detail
had
evidently
been
sought
with
patient
care
in
furniture
warehouses
there
was
the
elegance
of
antiquity
about
the
classic
revival
as
well
as
its
fragile
and
somewhat
arid
grace
the
man
himself
like
his
manner
of
life
was
in
grotesque
contrast
with
the
airy
mythological
look
of
his
rooms
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
the
most
eccentric
characters
are
found
among
men
who
give
their
whole
energies
to
men
of
this
stamp
are
in
a
certain
sense
intellectual
libertines
everything
is
within
their
reach
consequently
their
fancy
is
jaded
and
they
will
make
immense
efforts
to
shake
off
their
indifference
the
student
of
human
nature
can
always
discover
some
hobby
some
accessible
weakness
and
sensitive
spot
in
their
heart
chaboisseau
might
have
entrenched
himself
in
antiquity
as
in
an
impregnable
camp
the
man
will
be
an
antique
to
match
no
doubt
said
etienne
smiling
chaboisseau
a
little
old
person
with
powdered
hair
wore
a
greenish
coat
and
waistcoat
he
was
tricked
out
besides
in
black
ribbed
stockings
and
shoes
that
creaked
as
he
came
forward
to
take
the
bills
after
a
short
scrutiny
he
returned
them
to
lucien
with
a
serious
countenance
mm
fendant
and
cavalier
are
delightful
young
fellows
they
have
plenty
of
intelligence
but
i
have
no
money
he
said
blandly
my
friend
here
would
be
willing
to
meet
you
in
the
matter
of
discount
etienne
began
i
would
not
take
the
bills
on
any
consideration
returned
the
little
broker
the
words
slid
down
upon
lousteau
s
suggestion
like
the
blade
of
the
guillotine
on
a
man
s
neck
the
two
friends
withdrew
but
as
chaboisseau
went
prudently
out
with
them
across
the
lucien
noticed
a
pile
of
books
chaboisseau
had
been
in
the
trade
and
this
was
a
recent
purchase
shining
conspicuous
among
them
he
noticed
a
copy
of
a
work
by
the
architect
ducereau
which
gives
exceedingly
accurate
plans
of
various
royal
palaces
and
chateaux
in
france
could
you
let
me
have
that
book
he
asked
yes
said
chaboisseau
transformed
into
a
bookseller
how
much
fifty
it
is
dear
but
i
want
it
and
i
can
only
pay
you
with
one
of
the
bills
which
you
refuse
to
you
have
a
bill
there
for
five
hundred
francs
at
six
months
i
will
take
that
one
of
you
said
chaboisseau
apparently
at
the
last
statement
of
accounts
there
had
been
a
balance
of
five
hundred
francs
in
favor
of
fendant
and
cavalier
they
went
back
to
the
classical
department
chaboisseau
made
out
a
little
memorandum
interest
so
much
and
commission
so
much
total
deduction
thirty
francs
then
he
subtracted
fifty
francs
for
ducerceau
s
book
finally
from
a
full
of
coin
he
took
four
hundred
and
twenty
francs
look
here
though
chaboisseau
the
bills
are
either
all
of
them
good
or
all
bad
alike
why
don
t
you
take
the
rest
this
is
not
discounting
i
am
paying
myself
for
a
sale
said
the
old
man
etienne
and
lucien
were
still
laughing
at
chaboisseau
without
understanding
him
when
they
reached
dauriat
s
shop
and
etienne
asked
gabusson
to
give
them
the
name
of
a
gabusson
thus
appealed
to
gave
them
a
letter
of
introduction
to
a
broker
in
the
boulevard
poissonniere
telling
them
at
the
same
time
that
this
was
the
oddest
and
queerest
party
to
use
his
own
expression
that
he
gabusson
had
come
across
the
friends
took
a
cab
by
the
hour
and
went
to
the
address
if
samanon
won
t
take
your
bills
gabusson
had
said
nobody
else
will
look
at
a
bookseller
on
the
ground
floor
a
on
the
first
story
and
a
seller
of
indecent
prints
on
the
second
samanon
carried
on
a
fourth
business
he
was
a
into
the
bargain
no
character
in
hoffmann
s
romances
no
miser
of
scott
s
can
compare
with
this
freak
of
human
and
parisian
nature
always
admitting
that
samanon
was
human
in
spite
of
himself
lucien
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
the
little
old
creature
whose
bones
seemed
to
be
cutting
a
leather
skin
spotted
with
all
sorts
of
little
green
and
yellow
patches
like
a
portrait
by
titian
or
veronese
when
you
look
at
it
closely
one
of
samanon
s
eyes
was
fixed
and
glassy
the
other
lively
and
bright
he
seemed
to
keep
that
dead
eye
for
the
part
of
his
profession
and
the
other
for
the
trade
in
the
pornographic
curiosities
upstairs
a
few
stray
white
hairs
escaping
from
under
a
small
sleek
rusty
black
wig
stood
erect
above
a
sallow
forehead
with
a
suggestion
of
menace
about
it
a
hollow
trench
in
either
cheek
defined
the
outline
of
the
jaws
while
a
set
of
projecting
teeth
still
white
seemed
to
stretch
the
skin
of
the
lips
with
the
effect
of
an
equine
yawn
the
contrast
between
the
eyes
and
grinning
mouth
gave
samanon
a
passably
ferocious
air
and
the
very
bristles
on
the
man
s
chin
looked
stiff
and
sharp
as
pins
nor
was
there
the
slightest
sign
about
him
of
any
desire
to
redeem
a
sinister
appearance
by
attention
to
the
toilet
his
threadbare
jacket
was
all
but
dropping
to
pieces
a
cravat
which
had
once
been
black
was
frayed
by
contact
with
a
stubble
chin
and
left
on
exhibition
a
throat
as
wrinkled
as
a
s
this
was
the
individual
whom
etienne
and
lucien
discovered
in
his
filthy
busily
affixing
tickets
to
the
backs
of
a
parcel
of
books
from
a
recent
sale
in
a
glance
the
friends
exchanged
the
innumerable
questions
raised
by
the
existence
of
such
a
creature
then
they
presented
gabusson
s
introduction
and
fendant
and
cavalier
s
bills
samanon
was
still
reading
the
note
when
a
third
comer
entered
the
wearer
of
a
short
jacket
which
seemed
in
the
shop
to
be
cut
out
of
a
piece
of
zinc
roofing
so
solid
was
it
by
reason
of
alloy
with
all
kinds
of
foreign
matter
oddly
attired
as
he
was
the
man
was
an
artist
of
no
small
intellectual
power
and
ten
years
later
he
was
destined
to
assist
in
the
inauguration
of
the
great
but
system
i
want
my
coat
my
black
trousers
and
satin
waistcoat
said
this
person
pressing
a
numbered
ticket
on
samanon
s
attention
samanon
touched
the
brass
button
of
a
and
a
woman
came
down
from
some
upper
region
a
normande
apparently
to
judge
by
her
rich
fresh
complexion
let
the
gentleman
have
his
clothes
said
samanon
holding
out
a
hand
to
the
newcomer
it
s
a
pleasure
to
do
business
with
you
sir
but
that
youngster
whom
one
of
your
friends
introduced
to
me
took
me
in
most
took
in
chuckled
the
newcomer
pointing
out
samanon
to
the
two
journalists
with
an
extremely
comical
gesture
the
great
man
dropped
thirty
sous
into
the
s
yellow
wrinkled
hand
like
the
neapolitan
he
was
taking
his
best
clothes
out
of
pawn
for
a
state
occasion
the
coins
dropped
jingling
into
the
till
what
queer
business
are
you
up
to
asked
lousteau
of
the
artist
an
who
dwelt
among
visions
of
enchanted
palaces
till
he
either
could
not
or
would
not
create
lends
you
a
good
deal
more
than
an
ordinary
pawnbroker
on
anything
you
pledge
and
besides
he
is
so
awfully
charitable
he
allows
you
to
take
your
clothes
out
when
you
must
have
something
to
wear
i
am
going
to
dine
with
the
kellers
and
my
mistress
he
continued
and
to
me
it
is
easier
to
find
thirty
sous
than
two
hundred
francs
so
i
keep
my
wardrobe
here
it
has
brought
the
charitable
usurer
a
hundred
francs
in
the
last
six
months
samanon
has
devoured
my
library
already
volume
by
volume
a
and
sou
by
sou
lousteau
said
with
a
laugh
i
will
let
you
have
fifteen
hundred
francs
said
samanon
looking
up
lucien
started
as
if
the
had
thrust
a
skewer
through
his
heart
samanon
was
subjecting
the
bills
and
their
dates
to
a
close
scrutiny
and
even
then
he
added
i
must
see
fendant
first
he
ought
to
deposit
some
books
with
me
you
aren
t
worth
much
turning
to
lucien
you
are
living
with
coralie
and
your
furniture
has
been
lousteau
watching
lucien
saw
him
take
up
his
bills
and
dash
out
into
the
street
he
is
the
devil
himself
exclaimed
the
poet
for
several
seconds
he
stood
outside
gazing
at
the
shop
front
the
whole
place
was
so
pitiful
that
a
could
not
see
it
without
smiling
at
the
sight
and
wondering
what
kind
of
business
a
man
could
do
among
those
mean
dirty
shelves
of
ticketed
books
a
very
few
moments
later
the
great
man
in
incognito
came
out
very
well
dressed
smiled
at
his
friends
and
turned
to
go
with
them
in
the
direction
of
the
passage
des
panoramas
where
he
meant
to
complete
his
toilet
by
the
polishing
of
his
boots
if
you
see
samanon
in
a
bookseller
s
shop
or
calling
on
a
or
a
printer
you
may
know
that
it
is
all
over
with
that
man
said
the
artist
samanon
is
the
undertaker
come
to
take
the
measurements
for
a
you
won
t
discount
your
bills
now
lucien
said
etienne
if
samanon
will
not
take
them
nobody
else
will
he
is
the
said
the
stranger
he
is
one
of
gigonnet
s
lambs
a
spy
for
palma
werbrust
gobseck
and
the
rest
of
those
crocodiles
who
swim
in
the
paris
every
man
with
a
fortune
to
make
or
unmake
is
sure
to
come
across
one
of
them
sooner
or
if
you
can
not
discount
your
bills
at
fifty
per
cent
remarked
lousteau
you
must
exchange
them
for
hard
how
give
them
to
coralie
camusot
will
cash
them
for
you
are
disgusted
added
lousteau
as
lucien
cut
him
short
with
a
start
what
nonsense
how
can
you
allow
such
a
silly
scruple
to
turn
the
scale
when
your
future
is
in
the
balance
i
shall
take
this
money
to
coralie
in
any
case
began
lucien
here
is
more
folly
cried
lousteau
you
will
not
keep
your
creditors
quiet
with
four
hundred
francs
when
you
must
have
four
thousand
let
us
keep
a
little
and
get
drunk
on
it
if
we
lose
the
rest
at
et
that
is
sound
advice
said
the
great
man
those
words
spoken
not
four
paces
from
frascati
s
were
magnetic
in
their
effect
the
friends
dismissed
their
cab
and
went
up
to
the
at
the
outset
they
won
three
thousand
francs
then
they
lost
and
fell
to
five
hundred
again
they
won
three
thousand
seven
hundred
francs
and
again
they
lost
all
but
a
piece
after
another
turn
of
luck
they
staked
two
thousand
francs
on
an
even
number
to
double
the
stake
at
a
stroke
an
even
number
had
not
turned
up
for
five
times
in
succession
and
this
was
the
sixth
time
they
punted
the
whole
sum
and
an
odd
number
turned
up
once
more
after
two
hours
of
frenzied
excitement
the
two
dashed
down
the
staircase
with
the
hundred
francs
kept
back
for
the
dinner
upon
the
steps
between
two
pillars
which
support
the
little
veranda
to
which
so
many
eyes
have
been
upturned
in
longing
or
despair
lousteau
stopped
and
looked
into
lucien
s
flushed
excited
face
let
us
just
try
fifty
francs
he
said
and
up
the
stairs
again
they
went
an
hour
later
they
owned
a
thousand
crowns
black
had
turned
up
for
the
fifth
consecutive
time
they
trusted
that
their
previous
luck
would
not
repeat
itself
and
put
the
whole
sum
on
the
red
black
turned
up
for
the
sixth
time
they
had
lost
it
was
now
six
o
clock
let
us
just
try
francs
said
lucien
the
new
venture
was
soon
made
and
lost
the
francs
went
in
five
stakes
then
lucien
in
a
frenzy
flung
down
his
last
francs
on
the
number
of
his
age
and
won
no
words
can
describe
how
his
hands
trembled
as
he
raked
in
the
coins
which
the
bank
paid
him
one
by
one
he
handed
ten
louis
to
lousteau
fly
he
cried
take
it
to
very
lousteau
took
the
hint
and
went
to
order
dinner
lucien
left
alone
laid
his
thirty
louis
on
the
red
and
won
emboldened
by
the
inner
voice
which
a
gambler
always
hears
he
staked
the
whole
again
on
the
red
and
again
he
won
he
felt
as
if
there
were
a
furnace
within
him
without
heeding
the
voice
he
laid
a
hundred
and
twenty
louis
on
the
black
and
lost
then
to
the
torturing
excitement
of
suspense
succeeded
the
delicious
feeling
of
relief
known
to
the
gambler
who
has
nothing
left
to
lose
and
must
perforce
leave
the
palace
of
fire
in
which
his
dreams
melt
and
vanish
he
found
lousteau
at
very
s
and
flung
himself
upon
the
cookery
to
make
use
of
lafontaine
s
expression
and
drowned
his
cares
in
wine
by
nine
o
clock
his
ideas
were
so
confused
that
he
could
not
imagine
why
the
portress
in
the
rue
de
vendome
persisted
in
sending
him
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
mlle
coralie
has
gone
said
the
woman
she
has
taken
lodgings
elsewhere
she
left
her
address
with
me
on
this
scrap
of
lucien
was
too
far
gone
to
be
surprised
at
anything
he
went
back
to
the
cab
which
had
brought
him
and
was
driven
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
making
puns
to
himself
on
the
name
of
the
street
as
he
went
the
news
of
the
failure
of
the
had
come
like
a
coralie
taking
alarm
made
haste
to
sell
her
furniture
with
the
consent
of
her
creditors
to
little
old
cardot
who
installed
florentine
in
the
rooms
at
once
the
tradition
of
the
house
remained
unbroken
coralie
paid
her
creditors
and
satisfied
the
landlord
proceeding
with
her
as
she
called
it
while
berenice
bought
the
absolutely
indispensable
necessaries
to
furnish
a
lodging
in
the
rue
de
la
lune
a
few
doors
from
the
gymnase
here
coralie
was
waiting
for
lucien
s
return
she
had
brought
her
love
unsullied
out
of
the
shipwreck
and
twelve
hundred
francs
lucien
more
than
half
intoxicated
poured
out
his
woes
to
coralie
and
berenice
you
did
quite
right
my
angel
said
coralie
with
her
arms
about
his
neck
berenice
can
easily
negotiate
your
bills
with
the
next
morning
lucien
awoke
to
an
enchanted
world
of
happiness
made
about
him
by
coralie
she
was
more
loving
and
tender
in
those
days
than
she
had
ever
been
perhaps
she
thought
that
the
wealth
of
love
in
her
heart
should
make
him
amends
for
the
poverty
of
their
lodging
she
looked
bewitchingly
charming
with
the
loose
hair
straying
from
under
the
crushed
white
silk
handkerchief
about
her
head
there
was
soft
laughter
in
her
eyes
her
words
were
as
bright
as
the
first
rays
of
sunrise
that
shone
in
through
the
windows
pouring
a
flood
of
gold
upon
such
charming
poverty
not
that
the
room
was
squalid
the
walls
were
covered
with
a
paper
bordered
with
red
there
was
one
mirror
over
the
and
a
second
above
the
chest
of
drawers
the
bare
boards
were
covered
with
a
cheap
carpet
which
berenice
had
bought
in
spite
of
coralie
s
orders
and
paid
for
out
of
her
own
little
store
a
wardrobe
with
a
glass
door
and
a
chest
held
the
lovers
clothing
the
mahogany
chairs
were
covered
with
blue
cotton
stuff
and
berenice
had
managed
to
save
a
clock
and
a
couple
of
china
vases
from
the
catastrophe
as
well
as
four
spoons
and
forks
and
little
spoons
the
bedroom
was
entered
from
the
which
might
have
belonged
to
a
clerk
with
an
income
of
twelve
hundred
francs
the
kitchen
was
next
the
landing
and
berenice
slept
above
in
an
attic
the
rent
was
not
more
than
a
hundred
crowns
the
dismal
house
boasted
a
sham
carriage
entrance
the
porter
s
box
being
contrived
behind
one
of
the
useless
leaves
of
the
gate
and
lighted
by
a
peephole
through
which
that
personage
watched
the
comings
and
goings
of
seventeen
families
for
this
hive
was
a
property
in
auctioneer
s
phrase
lucien
looking
round
the
room
discovered
a
desk
an
paper
pens
and
ink
the
sight
of
berenice
in
high
spirits
she
was
building
hopes
on
coralie

at
the
gymnase
and
of
coralie
herself
conning
her
part
with
a
knot
of
blue
ribbon
tied
about
it
drove
all
cares
and
anxieties
from
the
sobered
poet
s
mind
so
long
as
nobody
in
society
hears
of
this
sudden
comedown
we
shall
pull
through
he
said
after
all
we
have
four
thousand
five
hundred
francs
before
us
i
will
turn
my
new
position
in
royalist
journalism
to
account
we
shall
start
the
i
am
an
old
hand
now
and
i
will
make
something
and
coralie
seeing
nothing
but
love
in
the
words
kissed
the
lips
that
uttered
them
by
this
time
berenice
had
set
the
table
near
the
fire
and
served
a
modest
breakfast
of
scrambled
eggs
a
couple
of
cutlets
coffee
and
cream
just
then
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
lucien
to
his
astonishment
beheld
three
of
his
loyal
friends
of
old
days
d
arthez
leon
giraud
and
michel
chrestien
he
was
deeply
touched
and
asked
them
to
share
the
breakfast
no
we
have
come
on
more
serious
business
than
condolence
said
d
arthez
we
know
the
whole
story
we
have
just
come
from
the
rue
de
vendome
you
know
my
opinions
lucien
under
any
other
circumstances
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
that
you
had
adopted
my
political
convictions
but
situated
as
you
are
with
regard
to
the
liberal
press
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
go
over
to
the
ultras
your
life
will
be
sullied
your
character
blighted
for
ever
we
have
come
to
entreat
you
in
the
name
of
our
friendship
weakened
though
it
may
be
not
to
soil
yourself
in
this
way
you
have
been
prominent
in
attacking
the
romantics
the
right
and
the
government
you
can
not
now
declare
for
the
government
the
right
and
the
my
reasons
for
the
change
are
based
on
lofty
grounds
the
end
will
justify
the
means
said
lucien
perhaps
you
do
not
fully
comprehend
our
position
on
the
side
of
the
government
said
leon
giraud
the
government
the
court
the
bourbons
the
absolutist
party
or
to
sum
up
in
the
general
expression
the
whole
system
opposed
to
the
constitutional
system
may
be
divided
upon
the
question
of
the
best
means
of
extinguishing
the
revolution
but
is
unanimous
as
to
the
advisability
of
extinguishing
the
newspapers
the
the
and
the
have
all
been
founded
for
the
express
purpose
of
replying
to
the
slander
gibes
and
railing
of
the
liberal
press
i
can
not
approve
them
for
it
is
precisely
this
failure
to
recognize
the
grandeur
of
our
priesthood
that
has
led
us
to
bring
out
a
serious
and
paper
which
perhaps
he
added
parenthetically
may
exercise
a
worthy
influence
before
very
long
and
win
respect
and
carry
weight
but
this
royalist
artillery
is
destined
for
a
first
attempt
at
reprisals
the
liberals
are
to
be
paid
back
in
their
own
coin
shaft
for
shaft
wound
for
wound
what
can
come
of
it
lucien
the
majority
of
newspaper
readers
incline
for
the
left
and
in
the
press
as
in
warfare
the
victory
is
with
the
big
battalions
you
will
be
blackguards
liars
enemies
of
the
people
the
other
side
will
be
defenders
of
their
country
martyrs
men
to
be
held
in
honor
though
they
may
be
even
more
hypocritical
and
slippery
than
their
opponents
in
these
ways
the
pernicious
influence
of
the
press
will
be
increased
while
the
most
odious
form
of
journalism
will
receive
sanction
insult
and
personalities
will
become
a
recognized
privilege
of
the
press
newspapers
have
taken
this
tone
in
the
subscribers
interests
and
when
both
sides
have
recourse
to
the
same
weapons
the
standard
is
set
and
the
general
tone
of
journalism
taken
for
granted
when
the
evil
is
developed
to
its
fullest
extent
restrictive
laws
will
be
followed
by
prohibitions
there
will
be
a
return
of
the
censorship
of
the
press
imposed
after
the
assassination
of
the
duc
de
berri
and
repealed
since
the
opening
of
the
chambers
and
do
you
know
what
the
nation
will
conclude
from
the
debate
the
people
will
believe
the
insinuations
of
the
liberal
press
they
will
think
that
the
bourbons
mean
to
attack
the
rights
of
property
acquired
by
the
revolution
and
some
fine
day
they
will
rise
and
shake
off
the
bourbons
you
are
not
only
soiling
your
life
lucien
you
are
going
over
to
the
losing
side
you
are
too
young
too
lately
a
journalist
too
little
initiated
into
the
secret
springs
of
motive
and
the
tricks
of
the
craft
you
have
aroused
too
much
jealousy
not
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
general
hue
and
cry
that
will
be
raised
against
you
in
the
liberal
newspapers
you
will
be
drawn
into
the
fray
by
party
spirit
now
still
at
though
the
fever
which
spent
itself
in
violence
in
and
now
appears
in
debates
in
the
chamber
and
polemics
in

lucien
though
you
may
choose
to
see
a
poet
in

whatever
may
happen
i
shall
gain
one
solid
advantage

no

by

said
michel

with
a
laugh
i
shall
have
my
children
by
that
time
said
lucien
and
if
you
cut
off
my
head
it
will
not
the
three
could
make
nothing
of
lucien
intercourse
with
the
great
world
had
developed
in
him
the
pride
of
caste
the
vanities
of
the
aristocrat
the
poet
thought
and
not
without
reason
that
there
was
a
fortune
in
his
good
looks
and
intellect
accompanied
by
the
name
and
title
of
rubempre
mme
d
espard
and
mme
de
bargeton
held
him
fast
by
this
clue
as
a

by
a
string
lucien
s
flight
was
circumscribed
the
words
he
is
one
of
us
he
is
sound
accidentally
overheard
but
three
days
ago
in
mlle

had
turned
his
head
the

the

the

blondet
the
lovely

the
comte
d

and
des
lupeaulx
all
the
most
influential
people
at
court
in
fact
had
congratulated
him
on
his
conversion
and
completed
his
intoxication
then
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
d
arthez
rejoined
you
of
all
men
will
find
it
hard
to
keep
clean
hands
and
i
know
you
lucien
you
will
feel
it
acutely
when
you
are
despised
by
the
very
men
to
whom
you
offer
the
three
took
leave
and
not
one
of
them
gave
him
a
friendly
handshake
lucien
was
thoughtful
and
sad
for
a
few
minutes
oh
never
mind
those
ninnies
cried
coralie
springing
upon
his
knee
and
putting
her
beautiful
arms
about
his
neck
they
take
life
seriously
and
life
is
a
joke
besides
you
are
going
to
be
count
lucien
de
rubempre
i
will
wheedle
the
if
there
is
no
other
way
i
know
how
to
come
round
that
rake
of
a
des
lupeaulx
who
will
sign
your
patent
did
i
not
tell
you
lucien
that
at
the
last
you
should
have
coralie
s
dead
body
for
a
stepping
stone
next
day
lucien
allowed
his
name
to
appear
in
the
list
of
contributors
to
the
his
name
was
announced
in
the
prospectus
with
a
flourish
of
trumpets
and
the
ministry
took
care
that
a
hundred
thousand
copies
should
be
scattered
abroad
far
and
wide
there
was
a
dinner
at
robert
s
two
doors
away
from
frascati
s
to
celebrate
the
inauguration
and
the
whole
band
of
royalist
writers
for
the
press
were
present
martainville
was
there
and
auger
and
destains
and
a
host
of
others
still
living
who
did
monarchy
and
religion
to
use
the
familiar
expression
coined
for
them
nathan
had
also
enlisted
under
the
banner
for
he
was
thinking
of
starting
a
theatre
and
not
unreasonably
held
that
it
was
better
to
have
the
licensing
authorities
for
him
than
against
him
we
will
pay
the
liberals
out
cried
merlin
gentlemen
said
nathan
if
we
are
for
war
let
us
have
war
in
earnest
we
must
not
carry
it
on
with
let
us
fall
upon
all
classicals
and
liberals
without
distinction
of
age
or
sex
and
put
them
all
to
the
sword
with
ridicule
there
must
be
no
we
must
act
honorably
there
must
be
no
bribing
with
copies
of
books
or
presents
no
taking
money
of
publishers
we
must
inaugurate
a
restoration
of
good
said
martainville
et

let
us
be
implacable
and
virulent
i
will
give
out

the

that
he
is

and
the
illustrious

of

a
war
of

was
unanimously
resolved
upon
and
by
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
all
shades
of
opinion
were
merged
and
drowned
together
with
every
glimmer
of
sense
in
a
flaming
bowl
of
punch
we
have
had
a
fine
monarchical
and
religious
jollification
remarked
an
illustrious
reveler
in
the
doorway
as
he
went
that
comment
appeared
in
the
next
day
s
issue
of
the
through
the
good
offices
of
a
publisher
among
the
guests
and
became
historic
lucien
was
supposed
to
be
the
traitor
who
blabbed
his
defection
gave
the
signal
for
a
terrific
hubbub
in
the
liberal
camp
lucien
was
the
butt
of
the
opposition
newspapers
and
ridiculed
unmercifully
the
whole
history
of
his
sonnets
was
given
to
the
public
dauriat
was
said
to
prefer
a
first
loss
of
a
thousand
crowns
to
the
risk
of
publishing
the
verses
lucien
was
called
the
poet
sans
sonnets
and
one
morning
in
that
very
paper
in
which
he
had
so
brilliant
a
beginning
he
read
the
following
lines
significant
enough
for
him
but
barely
intelligible
to
other
readers
if
dauriat
persistently
withholds
the
sonnets
of
the
future
petrarch
from
publication
we
will
act
like
generous
foes
we
will
open
our
own
columns
to
his
poems
which
must
be
piquant
indeed
to
judge
by
the
following
specimen
obligingly
communicated
by
a
friend
of
the
and
close
upon
that
ominous
preface
followed
a
sonnet
entitled
the
thistle
chardon
a
seedling
springing
up
one
day
among
the
flowers
in
a
garden
fair
made
boast
that
splendid
colors
bright
and
rare
its
claims
to
lofty
lineage
should
display
so
for
a
while
they
suffered
it
to
stay
but
with
such
insolence
it
flourished
there
that
out
of
patience
with
its
braggart
s
air
they
bade
it
prove
its
claims
without
delay
it
bloomed
forthwith
but
ne
er
was
blundering
clown
upon
the
boards
more
promptly
hooted
down
the
sister
flowers
began
to
jeer
and
laugh
the
owner
flung
it
out
at
close
of
day
a
solitary
jackass
came
to
bray
a
common
thistle
s
fitting
epitaph
lucien
read
the
words
through
scalding
tears
vernou
touched
elsewhere
on
lucien
s
gambling
propensities
and
spoke
of
the
forthcoming
of
charles
as
in
its
tendency
the
writer
siding
with
catholic
against
their
calvinist
victims
another
week
found
the
quarrel
embittered
lucien
had
counted
upon
his
friend
etienne
etienne
owed
him
a
thousand
francs
and
there
had
been
besides
a
private
understanding
between
them
but
etienne
lousteau
during
the
interval
became
his
sworn
foe
and
this
was
the
manner
of
it
for
the
past
three
months
nathan
had
been
smitten
with
florine
s
charms
and
much
at
a
loss
how
to
rid
himself
of
lousteau
his
rival
who
was
in
fact
dependent
upon
the
actress
and
now
came
nathan
s
opportunity
when
florine
was
frantic
with
distress
over
the
failure
of
the
which
left
her
without
an
engagement
he
went
as
lucien
s
colleague
to
beg
coralie
to
ask
for
a
part
for
florine
in
a
play
of
his
which
was
about
to
be
produced
at
the
gymnase
then
nathan
went
to
florine
and
made
capital
with
her
out
of
the
service
done
by
the
promise
of
a
conditional
engagement
ambition
turned
florine
s
head
she
did
not
hesitate
she
had
had
time
to
gauge
lousteau
pretty
thoroughly
lousteau
s
courses
were
weakening
his
will
and
here
was
nathan
with
his
ambitions
in
politics
and
literature
and
energies
strong
as
his
cravings
florine
proposed
to
reappear
on
the
stage
with
renewed
eclat
so
she
handed
over
matifat
s
correspondence
to
nathan
nathan
drove
a
bargain
for
them
with
matifat
and
took
the
sixth
share
of
finot
s
review
in
exchange
for
the
compromising
billets
after
this
florine
was
installed
in
sumptuously
furnished
apartments
in
the
rue
hauteville
where
she
took
nathan
for
her
protector
in
the
face
of
the
theatrical
and
journalistic
world
lousteau
was
terribly
overcome
he
wept
towards
the
close
of
a
dinner
given
by
his
friends
to
console
him
in
his
affliction
in
the
course
of
that
banquet
it
was
decided
that
nathan
had
not
acted
unfairly
several
writers
present
finot
and
vernou
for
instance
knew
of
florine
s
fervid
admiration
for
dramatic
literature
but
they
all
agreed
that
lucien
had
behaved
very
ill
when
he
arranged
that
business
at
the
gymnase
he
had
indeed
broken
the
most
sacred
laws
of
friendship
and
zeal
to
serve
his
new
friends
had
led
the
royalist
poet
on
to
sin
beyond
forgiveness
nathan
was
carried
away
by
passion
pronounced
bixiou
while
this
distinguished
provincial
as
blondet
calls
him
is
simply
scheming
for
his
own
selfish
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
deep
plots
were
laid
by
all
parties
alike
to
rid
themselves
of
this
little
upstart
intruder
of
a
poet
who
wanted
to
eat
everybody
up
vernou
bore
lucien
a
personal
grudge
and
undertook
to
keep
a
tight
hand
on
him
and
finot
declared
that
lucien
had
betrayed
the
secret
of
the
combination
against
matifat
and
thereby
swindled
him
finot
out
of
fifty
thousand
francs
nathan
acting
on
florine
s
advice
gained
finot
s
support
by
selling
him
the
sixth
share
for
fifteen
thousand
francs
and
lousteau
consequently
lost
his
commission
his
thousand
crowns
had
vanished
away
he
could
not
forgive
lucien
for
this
treacherous
blow
as
he
supposed
it
dealt
to
his
interests
the
wounds
of
vanity
refuse
to
heal
if
oxide
of
silver
gets
into
them
no
words
no
amount
of
description
can
depict
the
wrath
of
an
author
in
a
paroxysm
of
mortified
vanity
nor
the
energy
which
he
discovers
when
stung
by
the
poisoned
darts
of
sarcasm
but
on
the
other
hand
the
man
that
is
roused
to
by
a
personal
attack
usually
subsides
very
promptly
the
more
phlegmatic
race
who
take
these
things
quietly
lay
their
account
with
the
oblivion
which
speedily
overtakes
the
spiteful
article
these
are
the
truly
courageous
men
of
letters
and
if
the
weaklings
seem
at
first
to
be
the
strong
men
they
can
not
hold
out
for
any
length
of
time
during
that
first
fortnight
while
the
fury
was
upon
him
lucien
poured
a
perfect
hailstorm
of
articles
into
the
royalist
papers
in
which
he
shared
the
responsibilities
of
criticism
with
hector
merlin
he
was
always
in
the
breach
pounding
away
with
all
his
might
in
the
backed
up
by
martainville
the
only
one
among
his
associates
who
stood
by
him
without
an
afterthought
martainville
was
not
in
the
secret
of
certain
understandings
made
and
ratified
amid
jokes
or
at
dauriat
s
in
the
wooden
galleries
or
behind
the
scenes
at
the
vaudeville
when
journalists
of
either
side
met
on
neutral
ground
when
lucien
went
to
the
greenroom
of
the
vaudeville
he
met
with
no
welcome
the
men
of
his
own
party
held
out
a
hand
to
shake
the
others
cut
him
and
all
the
while
hector
merlin
and
theodore
gaillard
fraternized
unblushingly
with
finot
lousteau
and
vernou
and
the
rest
of
the
journalists
who
were
known
for
good
the
greenroom
of
the
vaudeville
in
those
days
was
a
hotbed
of
gossip
as
well
as
a
neutral
ground
where
men
of
every
shade
of
opinion
could
meet
so
much
so
that
the
president
of
a
court
of
law
after
reproving
a
learned
brother
in
a
certain
council
chamber
for
sweeping
the
greenroom
with
his
gown
met
the
subject
of
his
strictures
gown
to
gown
in
the
greenroom
of
the
vaudeville
lousteau
in
time
shook
hands
again
with
nathan
finot
came
thither
almost
every
evening
and
lucien
whenever
he
could
spare
the
time
went
to
the
vaudeville
to
watch
the
enemies
who
showed
no
sign
of
relenting
towards
the
unfortunate
boy
in
the
time
of
the
restoration
party
hatred
was
far
more
bitter
than
in
our
day
intensity
of
feeling
is
diminished
in
our
age
the
critic
cuts
a
book
to
pieces
and
shakes
hands
with
the
author
afterwards
and
the
victim
must
keep
on
good
terms
with
his
slaughterer
or
run
the
gantlet
of
innumerable
jokes
at
his
expense
if
he
refuses
he
is
unsociable
eaten
up
with
he
is
sulky
and
rancorous
he
bears
malice
he
is
a
bad
let
an
author
receive
a
treacherous
stab
in
the
back
let
him
avoid
the
snares
set
for
him
with
base
hypocrisy
and
endure
the
most
unhandsome
treatment
he
must
still
exchange
greetings
with
his
assassin
who
for
that
matter
claims
the
esteem
and
friendship
of
his
victim
everything
can
be
excused
and
justified
in
an
age
which
has
transformed
vice
into
virtue
and
virtue
into
vice
has
come
to
be
the
most
sacred
of
our
liberties
the
representatives
of
the
most
opposite
opinions
courteously
blunt
the
edge
of
their
words
and
fence
with
buttoned
foils
but
in
those
almost
forgotten
days
the
same
theatre
could
scarcely
hold
certain
royalist
and
liberal
journalists
the
most
malignant
provocation
was
offered
glances
were
like
the
least
spark
produced
an
explosion
of
quarrel
who
has
not
heard
his
neighbor
s
oath
on
the
entrance
of
some
man
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
on
the
opposing
side
there
were
but
two
parties
royalists
and
liberals
classics
and
romantics
you
found
the
same
hatred
masquerading
in
either
form
and
no
longer
wondered
at
the
scaffolds
of
the
convention
lucien
had
been
a
liberal
and
a
hot
voltairean
now
he
was
a
rabid
royalist
and
a
romantic
martainville
the
only
one
among
his
colleagues
who
really
liked
him
and
stood
by
him
loyally
was
more
hated
by
the
liberals
than
any
man
on
the
royalist
side
and
this
fact
drew
down
all
the
hate
of
the
liberals
on
lucien
s
head
martainville
s
staunch
friendship
injured
lucien
political
parties
show
scanty
gratitude
to
outpost
sentinels
and
leave
leaders
of
forlorn
hopes
to
their
fate
tis
a
rule
of
warfare
which
holds
equally
good
in
matters
political
to
keep
with
the
main
body
of
the
army
if
you
mean
to
succeed
the
spite
of
the
small
liberal
papers
fastened
at
once
on
the
opportunity
of
coupling
the
two
names
and
flung
them
into
each
other
s
arms
their
friendship
real
or
imaginary
brought
down
upon
them
both
a
series
of
articles
written
by
pens
dipped
in
gall
felicien
vernou
was
furious
with
jealousy
of
lucien
s
social
success
and
believed
like
all
his
old
associates
in
the
poet
s
approaching
elevation
the
fiction
of
lucien
s
treason
was
embellished
with
every
kind
of
aggravating
circumstance
he
was
called
judas
the
less
martainville
being
judas
the
great
for
martainville
was
supposed
rightly
or
wrongly
to
have
given
up
the
bridge
of
pecq
to
the
foreign
invaders
lucien
said
jestingly
to
des
lupeaulx
that
he
himself
surely
had
given
up
the
asses
bridge
lucien
s
luxurious
life
hollow
though
it
was
and
founded
on
expectations
had
estranged
his
friends
they
could
not
forgive
him
for
the
carriage
which
he
had
put
down
for
them
he
was
still
rolling
about
in
it
nor
yet
for
the
splendors
of
the
rue
de
vendome
which
he
had
left
all
of
them
felt
instinctively
that
nothing
was
beyond
the
reach
of
this
young
and
handsome
poet
with
intellect
enough
and
to
spare
they
themselves
had
trained
him
in
corruption
and
therefore
they
left
no
stone
unturned
to
ruin
him
some
few
days
before
coralie
s
first
appearance
at
the
gymnase
lucien
and
hector
merlin
went
to
the
vaudeville
merlin
was
scolding
his
friend
for
giving
a
helping
hand
to
nathan
in
florine
s
affair
you
then
and
there
made
two
mortal
enemies
of
lousteau
and
nathan
he
said
i
gave
you
good
advice
and
you
took
no
notice
of
it
you
gave
praise
you
did
them
a
good
turn
you
will
be
well
punished
for
your
kindness
florine
and
coralie
will
never
live
in
peace
on
the
same
stage
both
will
wish
to
be
first
you
can
only
defend
coralie
in
our
papers
and
nathan
not
only
has
a
pull
as
a
dramatic
author
he
can
control
the
dramatic
criticism
in
the
liberal
newspapers
he
has
been
a
journalist
a
little
longer
than
you
the
words
responded
to
lucien
s
inward
misgivings
neither
nathan
nor
gaillard
was
treating
him
with
the
frankness
which
he
had
a
right
to
expect
but
so
new
a
convert
could
hardly
complain
gaillard
utterly
confounded
lucien
by
saying
roundly
that
newcomers
must
give
proofs
of
their
sincerity
for
some
time
before
their
party
could
trust
them
there
was
more
jealousy
than
he
had
imagined
in
the
inner
circles
of
royalist
and
ministerial
journalism
the
jealousy
of
curs
fighting
for
a
bone
is
apt
to
appear
in
the
human
species
when
there
is
a
loaf
to
divide
there
is
the
same
growling
and
showing
of
teeth
the
same
characteristics
come
out
in
every
possible
way
these
writers
of
articles
tried
to
injure
each
other
with
those
in
power
they
brought
reciprocal
accusations
of
lukewarm
zeal
they
invented
the
most
treacherous
ways
of
getting
rid
of
a
rival
there
had
been
none
of
this
internecine
warfare
among
the
liberals
they
were
too
far
from
power
too
hopelessly
out
of
favor
and
lucien
amid
the
inextricable
tangle
of
ambitions
had
neither
the
courage
to
draw
sword
and
cut
the
knot
or
the
patience
to
unravel
it
he
could
not
be
the
beaumarchais
the
aretino
the
freron
of
his
epoch
he
was
not
made
of
such
stuff
he
thought
of
nothing
but
his
one
desire
the
patent
of
nobility
for
he
saw
clearly
that
for
him
such
a
restoration
meant
a
wealthy
marriage
and
the
title
once
secured
chance
and
his
good
looks
would
do
the
rest
this
was
all
his
plan
and
etienne
lousteau
who
had
confided
so
much
to
him
knew
his
secret
knew
how
to
deal
a
deathblow
to
the
poet
of
angouleme
that
very
night
as
lucien
and
merlin
went
to
the
vaudeville
etienne
had
laid
a
terrible
trap
into
which
an
inexperienced
boy
could
not
but
fall
here
is
our
handsome
lucien
said
finot
drawing
des
lupeaulx
in
the
direction
of
the
poet
and
shaking
hands
with
feline
amiability
i
can
not
think
of
another
example
of
such
rapid
success
continued
finot
looking
from
des
lupeaulx
to
lucien
there
are
two
sorts
of
success
in
paris
there
is
a
fortune
in
solid
cash
which
any
one
can
amass
and
there
is
the
intangible
fortune
of
connections
position
or
a
footing
in
certain
circles
inaccessible
for
certain
persons
however
rich
they
may
be
now
my
friend
here
our
friend
interposed
des
lupeaulx
smiling
blandly
our
friend
repeated
finot
patting
lucien
s
hand
has
made
a
brilliant
success
from
this
point
of
view
truth
to
tell
lucien
has
more
in
him
more
gift
more
wit
than
the
rest
of
us
that
envy
him
and
he
is
enchantingly
handsome
besides
his
old
friends
can
not
forgive
him
for
his
success
they
call
it
luck
of
that
sort
never
comes
to
fools
or
incapables
said
des
lupeaulx
can
you
call
bonaparte
s
fortune
luck
eh
there
were
a
score
of
applicants
for
the
command
of
the
army
in
italy
just
as
there
are
a
hundred
young
men
at
this
moment
who
would
like
to
have
an
entrance
to
mlle
des
touches
house
people
are
coupling
her
name
with
yours
already
in
society
my
dear
boy
said
des
lupeaulx
clapping
lucien
on
the
shoulder
ah
you
are
in
high
favor
mme
d
espard
mme
de
bargeton
and
mme
de
montcornet
are
wild
about
you
you
are
going
to
mme
firmiani
s
party
are
you
not
and
to
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
s
rout
yes
said
lucien
allow
me
to
introduce
a
young
banker
to
you
a
du
tillet
you
ought
to
be
acquainted
he
has
contrived
to
make
a
great
fortune
in
a
short
lucien
and
du
tillet
bowed
and
entered
into
conversation
and
the
banker
asked
lucien
to
dinner
finot
and
des
lupeaulx
a
pair
knew
each
other
well
enough
to
keep
upon
good
terms
they
turned
away
to
continue
their
chat
on
one
of
the
sofas
in
the
greenroom
and
left
lucien
with
du
tillet
merlin
and
nathan
by
the
way
my
friend
said
finot
tell
me
how
things
stand
is
there
really
somebody
behind
lucien
for
he
is
the
of
my
staff
and
before
allowing
them
to
plot
against
him
i
thought
i
should
like
to
know
whether
in
your
opinion
it
would
be
better
to
baffle
them
and
keep
well
with
the
master
of
requests
and
finot
looked
at
each
other
very
closely
for
a
moment
or
two
my
dear
fellow
said
des
lupeaulx
how
can
you
imagine
that
the
marquise
d
espard
or
chatelet
or
mme
de
bargeton
who
has
procured
the
baron
s
nomination
to
the
prefecture
and
the
title
of
count
so
as
to
return
in
triumph
to
angouleme
how
can
you
suppose
that
any
of
them
will
forgive
lucien
for
his
attacks
on
them
they
dropped
him
down
in
the
royalist
ranks
to
crush
him
out
of
existence
at
this
moment
they
are
looking
round
for
any
excuse
for
not
fulfilling
the
promises
they
made
to
that
boy
help
them
to
some
you
will
do
the
greatest
possible
service
to
the
two
women
and
some
day
or
other
they
will
remember
it
i
am
in
their
secrets
i
was
surprised
to
find
how
much
they
hated
the
little
fellow
this
lucien
might
have
rid
himself
of
his
bitterest
enemy
mme
de
bargeton
by
desisting
from
his
attacks
on
terms
which
a
woman
loves
to
grant
do
you
take
me
he
is
young
and
handsome
he
should
have
drowned
her
hate
in
torrents
of
love
he
would
be
comte
de
rubempre
by
this
time
the
would
have
obtained
some
sinecure
for
him
some
post
in
the
royal
household
lucien
would
have
made
a
very
pretty
reader
to
louis
xviii
he
might
have
been
librarian
somewhere
or
other
master
of
requests
for
a
joke
master
of
revels
what
you
please
the
young
fool
has
missed
his
chance
perhaps
that
is
his
unpardonable
sin
instead
of
imposing
his
conditions
he
has
accepted
them
when
lucien
was
caught
with
the
bait
of
the
patent
of
nobility
the
baron
chatelet
made
a
great
step
coralie
has
been
the
ruin
of
that
boy
if
he
had
not
had
the
actress
for
his
mistress
he
would
have
turned
again
to
the
and
he
would
have
had
her
then
we
can
knock
him
over
how
des
lupeaulx
asked
carelessly
he
saw
a
way
of
gaining
credit
with
the
marquise
d
espard
for
this
service
he
is
under
contract
to
write
for
lousteau
s
paper
and
we
can
the
better
hold
him
to
his
agreement
because
he
has
not
a
sou
if
we
tickle
up
the
keeper
of
the
seals
with
a
facetious
article
and
prove
that
lucien
wrote
it
he
will
consider
that
lucien
is
unworthy
of
the
king
s
favor
we
have
a
plot
on
hand
besides
coralie
will
be
ruined
and
our
distinguished
provincial
will
lose
his
head
when
his
mistress
is
hissed
off
the
stage
and
left
without
an
engagement
when
once
the
patent
is
suspended
we
will
laugh
at
the
victim
s
aristocratic
pretensions
and
allude
to
his
mother
the
nurse
and
his
father
the
apothecary
lucien
s
courage
is
only
skindeep
he
will
collapse
we
will
send
him
back
to
his
provinces
nathan
made
florine
sell
me
matifat
s
sixth
share
of
the
review
i
was
able
to
buy
dauriat
and
i
are
the
only
proprietors
now
we
might
come
to
an
understanding
you
and
i
and
the
review
might
be
taken
over
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
i
stipulated
for
the
restitution
of
my
sixth
before
i
undertook
to
protect
nathan
and
florine
they
let
me
have
it
and
i
must
help
them
but
i
wished
to
know
first
how
lucien
stood
you
deserve
your
name
said
des
lupeaulx
i
like
a
man
of
your
sort
very
well
then
can
you
arrange
a
definite
engagement
for
florine
asked
finot
yes
but
rid
us
of
lucien
for
rastignac
and
de
marsay
never
wish
to
hear
of
him
sleep
in
peace
returned
finot
nathan
and
merlin
will
always
have
articles
ready
for
gaillard
who
will
promise
to
take
them
lucien
will
never
get
a
line
into
the
paper
we
will
cut
off
his
supplies
there
is
only
martainville
s
paper
left
him
in
which
to
defend
himself
and
coralie
what
can
a
single
paper
do
against
so
many
i
will
let
you
know
the
weak
points
of
the
ministry
but
get
lucien
to
write
that
article
and
hand
over
the
manuscript
said
des
lupeaulx
who
refrained
carefully
from
informing
finot
that
lucien
s
promised
patent
was
nothing
but
a
joke
when
des
lupeaulx
had
gone
finot
went
to
lucien
and
taking
the
tone
which
deceives
so
many
victims
he
explained
that
he
could
not
possibly
afford
to
lose
his
contributor
and
at
the
same
time
he
shrank
from
taking
proceedings
which
might
ruin
him
with
his
friends
of
the
other
side
finot
himself
liked
a
man
who
was
strong
enough
to
change
his
opinions
they
were
pretty
sure
to
come
across
one
another
he
and
lucien
and
might
be
mutually
helpful
in
a
thousand
little
ways
lucien
besides
needed
a
sure
man
in
the
liberal
party
to
attack
the
ultras
and
men
in
office
who
might
refuse
to
help
him
suppose
that
they
play
you
false
what
will
you
do
finot
ended
suppose
that
some
minister
fancies
that
he
has
you
fast
by
the
halter
of
your
apostasy
and
turns
the
cold
shoulder
on
you
you
will
be
glad
to
set
on
a
few
dogs
to
snap
at
his
legs
will
you
not
very
well
but
you
have
made
a
deadly
enemy
of
lousteau
he
is
thirsting
for
your
blood
you
and
felicien
are
not
on
speaking
terms
i
only
remain
to
you
it
is
a
rule
of
the
craft
to
keep
a
good
understanding
with
every
man
of
real
ability
in
the
world
which
you
are
about
to
enter
you
can
do
me
services
in
return
for
mine
with
the
press
but
business
first
let
me
have
purely
literary
articles
they
will
not
compromise
you
and
we
shall
have
executed
our
lucien
saw
nothing
but
and
a
shrewd
eye
to
business
in
finot
s
offer
finot
and
des
lupeaulx
had
flattered
him
and
he
was
in
a
good
humor
he
actually
thanked
finot
ambitious
men
like
all
those
who
can
only
make
their
way
by
the
help
of
others
and
of
circumstances
are
bound
to
lay
their
plans
very
carefully
and
to
adhere
very
closely
to
the
course
of
conduct
on
which
they
determine
it
is
a
cruel
moment
in
the
lives
of
such
aspirants
when
some
unknown
power
brings
the
fabric
of
their
fortunes
to
some
severe
test
and
everything
gives
way
at
once
threads
are
snapped
or
entangled
and
misfortune
appears
on
every
side
let
a
man
lose
his
head
in
the
confusion
it
is
all
over
with
him
but
if
he
can
resist
this
first
revolt
of
circumstances
if
he
can
stand
erect
until
the
tempest
passes
over
or
make
a
supreme
effort
and
reach
the
serene
sphere
about
the
storm
then
he
is
really
strong
to
every
man
unless
he
is
born
rich
there
comes
sooner
or
later
his
fatal
week
as
it
must
be
called
for
napoleon
for
instance
that
week
was
the
retreat
from
moscow
it
had
begun
now
for
lucien
social
and
literary
success
had
come
to
him
too
easily
he
had
had
such
luck
that
he
was
bound
to
know
reverses
and
to
see
men
and
circumstances
turn
against
him
the
first
blow
was
the
heaviest
and
the
most
keenly
felt
for
it
touched
lucien
where
he
thought
himself
invulnerable
in
his
heart
and
his
love
coralie
might
not
be
clever
but
hers
was
a
noble
nature
and
she
possessed
the
great
actress
faculty
of
suddenly
standing
aloof
from
self
this
strange
phenomenon
is
subject
until
it
degenerates
into
a
habit
with
long
practice
to
the
caprices
of
character
and
not
seldom
to
an
admirable
delicacy
of
feeling
in
actresses
who
are
still
young
coralie
to
all
appearance
bold
and
wanton
as
the
part
required
was
in
reality
girlish
and
timid
and
love
had
wrought
in
her
a
revulsion
of
her
woman
s
heart
against
the
comedian
s
mask
art
the
supreme
art
of
feigning
passion
and
feeling
had
not
yet
triumphed
over
nature
in
her
she
shrank
before
a
great
audience
from
the
utterance
that
belongs
to
love
alone
and
coralie
suffered
besides
from
another
true
woman
s
weakness
she
needed
success
born
stage
queen
though
she
was
she
could
not
confront
an
audience
with
which
she
was
out
of
sympathy
she
was
nervous
when
she
appeared
on
the
stage
a
cold
reception
paralyzed
her
each
new
part
gave
her
the
terrible
sensations
of
a
first
appearance
applause
produced
a
sort
of
intoxication
which
gave
her
encouragement
without
flattering
her
vanity
at
a
murmur
of
dissatisfaction
or
before
a
silent
house
she
flagged
but
a
great
audience
following
attentively
admiringly
willing
to
be
pleased
electrified
coralie
she
felt
at
once
in
communication
with
the
nobler
qualities
of
all
those
listeners
she
felt
that
she
possessed
the
power
of
stirring
their
souls
and
carrying
them
with
her
but
if
this
action
and
reaction
of
the
audience
upon
the
actress
reveals
the
nervous
organization
of
genius
it
shows
no
less
clearly
the
poor
child
s
sensitiveness
and
delicacy
lucien
had
discovered
the
treasures
of
her
nature
had
learned
in
the
past
months
that
this
woman
who
loved
him
was
still
so
much
of
a
girl
and
coralie
was
unskilled
in
the
wiles
of
an
actress
she
could
not
fight
her
own
battles
nor
protect
herself
against
the
machinations
of
jealousy
behind
the
scenes
florine
was
jealous
of
her
and
florine
was
as
dangerous
and
depraved
as
coralie
was
simple
and
generous
roles
must
come
to
find
coralie
she
was
too
proud
to
implore
authors
or
to
submit
to
dishonoring
conditions
she
would
not
give
herself
to
the
first
journalist
who
persecuted
her
with
his
advances
and
threatened
her
with
his
pen
genius
is
rare
enough
in
the
extraordinary
art
of
the
stage
but
genius
is
only
one
condition
of
success
among
many
and
is
positively
hurtful
unless
it
is
accompanied
by
a
genius
for
intrigue
in
which
coralie
was
utterly
lacking
lucien
knew
how
much
his
friend
would
suffer
on
her
first
appearance
at
the
gymnase
and
was
anxious
at
all
costs
to
obtain
a
success
for
her
but
all
the
money
remaining
from
the
sale
of
the
furniture
and
all
lucien
s
earnings
had
been
sunk
in
costumes
in
the
furniture
of
a
and
the
expenses
of
a
first
appearance
a
few
days
later
lucien
made
up
his
mind
to
a
humiliating
step
for
love
s
sake
he
took
fendant
and
cavalier
s
bills
and
went
to
the
in
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
he
would
ask
camusot
to
discount
them
the
poet
had
not
fallen
so
low
that
he
could
make
this
attempt
quite
coolly
there
had
been
many
a
sharp
struggle
first
and
the
way
to
that
decision
had
been
paved
with
many
dreadful
thoughts
nevertheless
he
arrived
at
last
in
the
dark
cheerless
little
private
office
that
looked
out
upon
a
yard
and
found
camusot
seated
gravely
there
this
was
not
coralie
s
infatuated
adorer
not
the
indolent
incredulous
libertine
whom
he
had
known
hitherto
as
camusot
but
a
heavy
father
of
a
family
a
merchant
grown
old
in
shrewd
expedients
of
business
and
respectable
virtues
wearing
a
magistrate
s
mask
of
judicial
prudery
this
camusot
was
the
cool
head
of
the
firm
surrounded
by
clerks
green
cardboard
boxes
pigeonholes
invoices
and
samples
and
fortified
by
the
presence
of
a
wife
and
a
daughter
lucien
trembled
from
head
to
foot
as
he
approached
for
the
worthy
merchant
like
the
turned
cool
indifferent
eyes
upon
him
here
are
two
or
three
bills
monsieur
he
said
standing
beside
the
merchant
who
did
not
rise
from
his
desk
if
you
will
take
them
of
me
you
will
oblige
me
you
have
taken
something
of
monsieur
said
camusot
i
do
not
forget
on
this
lucien
explained
coralie
s
predicament
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
bending
to
murmur
his
explanation
so
that
camusot
could
hear
the
heavy
throbbing
of
the
humiliated
poet
s
heart
it
was
no
part
of
camusot
s
plans
that
coralie
should
suffer
a
check
he
listened
smiling
to
himself
over
the
signatures
on
the
bills
for
as
a
judge
at
the
tribunal
of
commerce
he
knew
how
the
booksellers
stood
but
in
the
end
he
gave
lucien
four
thousand
five
hundred
francs
for
them
stipulating
that
he
should
add
the
formula
for
value
received
in
lucien
went
straight
to
braulard
and
made
arrangements
for
a
good
reception
braulard
promised
to
come
to
the
to
determine
on
the
points
where
his
romans
should
work
their
fleshy
clappers
to
bring
down
the
house
in
applause
lucien
gave
the
rest
of
the
money
to
coralie
he
did
not
tell
her
how
he
had
come
by
it
and
allayed
her
anxieties
and
the
fears
of
berenice
who
was
sorely
troubled
over
their
daily
expenses
martainville
came
several
times
to
hear
coralie
rehearse
and
he
knew
more
of
the
stage
than
most
men
of
his
time
several
royalist
writers
had
promised
favorable
articles
lucien
had
not
a
suspicion
of
the
impending
disaster
a
fatal
event
occurred
on
the
evening
before
coralie
s
d
arthez
s
book
had
appeared
and
the
editor
of
merlin
s
paper
considering
lucien
to
be
the
best
qualified
man
on
the
staff
gave
him
the
book
to
review
he
owed
his
unlucky
reputation
to
those
articles
on
nathan
s
work
there
were
several
men
in
the
office
at
the
time
for
all
the
staff
had
been
summoned
martainville
was
explaining
that
the
party
warfare
with
the
liberals
must
be
waged
on
certain
lines
nathan
merlin
all
the
contributors
in
fact
were
talking
of
leon
giraud
s
paper
and
remarking
that
its
influence
was
the
more
pernicious
because
the
language
was
guarded
cool
moderate
people
were
beginning
to
speak
of
the
circle
in
the
rue
des
as
a
second
convention
it
had
been
decided
that
the
royalist
papers
were
to
wage
a
systematic
war
of
extermination
against
these
dangerous
opponents
who
indeed
at
a
later
day
were
destined
to
sow
the
doctrines
that
drove
the
bourbons
into
exile
but
that
was
only
after
the
most
brilliant
of
royalist
writers
had
joined
them
for
the
sake
of
a
mean
revenge
d
arthez
s
absolutist
opinions
were
not
known
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
he
shared
the
views
of
his
clique
he
fell
under
the
same
anathema
and
he
was
to
be
the
first
victim
his
book
was
to
be
honored
with
a
slashing
article
to
use
the
consecrated
formula
lucien
refused
to
write
the
article
great
was
the
commotion
among
the
leading
royalist
writers
thus
met
in
conclave
lucien
was
told
plainly
that
a
renegade
could
not
do
as
he
pleased
if
it
did
not
suit
his
views
to
take
the
side
of
the
monarchy
and
religion
he
could
go
back
to
the
other
camp
merlin
and
martainville
took
him
aside
and
begged
him
as
his
friends
to
remember
that
he
would
simply
hand
coralie
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
liberal
papers
for
she
would
find
no
champions
on
the
royalist
and
ministerial
side
her
acting
was
certain
to
provoke
a
hot
battle
and
the
kind
of
discussion
which
every
actress
longs
to
arouse
you
don
t
understand
it
in
the
least
said
martainville
if
she
plays
for
three
months
amid
a
of
criticism
she
will
make
thirty
thousand
francs
when
she
goes
on
tour
in
the
provinces
at
the
end
of
the
season
and
here
are
you
about
to
sacrifice
coralie
and
your
own
future
and
to
quarrel
with
your
own
bread
and
butter
all
for
a
scruple
that
will
always
stand
in
your
way
and
ought
to
be
got
rid
of
at
lucien
was
forced
to
choose
between
d
arthez
and
coralie
his
mistress
would
be
ruined
unless
he
dealt
his
friend
a
in
the
and
the
great
newspaper
poor
poet
he
went
home
with
death
in
his
soul
and
by
the
fireside
he
sat
and
read
that
finest
production
of
modern
literature
tears
fell
fast
over
it
as
the
pages
turned
for
a
long
while
he
hesitated
but
at
last
he
took
up
the
pen
and
wrote
a
sarcastic
article
of
the
kind
that
he
understood
so
well
taking
the
book
as
children
might
take
some
bright
bird
to
strip
it
of
its
plumage
and
torture
it
his
sardonic
jests
were
sure
to
tell
again
he
turned
to
the
book
and
as
he
read
it
over
a
second
time
his
better
self
awoke
in
the
dead
of
night
he
hurried
across
paris
and
stood
outside
d
arthez
s
house
he
looked
up
at
the
windows
and
saw
the
faint
pure
gleam
of
light
in
the
panes
as
he
had
so
often
seen
it
with
a
feeling
of
admiration
for
the
noble
steadfastness
of
that
truly
great
nature
for
some
moments
he
stood
irresolute
on
the
curbstone
he
had
not
courage
to
go
further
but
his
good
angel
urged
him
on
he
tapped
at
the
door
and
opened
and
found
d
arthez
sitting
reading
in
a
fireless
room
what
has
happened
asked
d
arthez
for
news
of
some
dreadful
kind
was
visible
in
lucien
s
ghastly
face
your
book
is
sublime
d
arthez
said
lucien
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
they
have
ordered
me
to
write
an
attack
upon
poor
boy
the
bread
that
they
give
you
is
hard
indeed
said
d
arthez
i
only
ask
for
one
favor
keep
my
visit
a
secret
and
leave
me
to
my
hell
to
the
occupations
of
the
damned
perhaps
it
is
impossible
to
attain
to
success
until
the
heart
is
seared
and
callous
in
every
most
sensitive
the
same
as
ever
cried
d
arthez
do
you
think
me
a
base
poltroon
no
d
arthez
no
i
am
a
boy
half
crazed
with
love
and
he
told
his
story
let
us
look
at
the
article
said
d
arthez
touched
by
all
that
lucien
said
of
coralie
lucien
held
out
the
manuscript
d
arthez
read
and
could
not
help
smiling
oh
what
a
fatal
waste
of
intellect
he
began
but
at
the
sight
of
lucien
overcome
with
grief
in
the
opposite
armchair
he
checked
himself
will
you
leave
it
with
me
to
correct
i
will
let
you
have
it
again
he
went
on
flippancy
depreciates
a
work
serious
and
conscientious
criticism
is
sometimes
praise
in
itself
i
know
a
way
to
make
your
article
more
honorable
both
for
yourself
and
for
me
besides
i
know
my
faults
well
when
you
climb
a
hot
shadowless
hillside
you
sometimes
find
fruit
to
quench
your
torturing
thirst
and
i
have
found
it
here
and
now
said
lucien
as
he
sprang
sobbing
to
d
arthez
s
arms
and
kissed
his
friend
on
the
forehead
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
leaving
my
conscience
in
your
keeping
some
day
i
will
come
to
you
and
ask
for
it
i
look
upon
a
periodical
repentance
as
great
hypocrisy
d
arthez
said
solemnly
repentance
becomes
a
sort
of
indemnity
for
wrongdoing
repentance
is
virginity
of
the
soul
which
we
must
keep
for
god
a
man
who
repents
twice
is
a
horrible
sycophant
i
am
afraid
that
you
regard
repentance
as
lucien
went
slowly
back
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
stricken
dumb
by
those
words
next
morning
d
arthez
sent
back
his
article
recast
throughout
and
lucien
sent
it
in
to
the
review
but
from
that
day
melancholy
preyed
upon
him
and
he
could
not
always
disguise
his
mood
that
evening
when
the
theatre
was
full
he
experienced
for
the
first
time
the
paroxysm
of
nervous
terror
caused
by
a
terror
aggravated
in
his
case
by
all
the
strength
of
his
love
vanity
of
every
kind
was
involved
he
looked
over
the
rows
of
faces
as
a
criminal
eyes
the
judges
and
the
jury
on
whom
his
life
depends
a
murmur
would
have
set
him
quivering
any
slight
incident
upon
the
stage
coralie
s
exits
and
entrances
the
slightest
modulation
of
the
tones
of
her
voice
would
perturb
him
beyond
all
reason
the
play
in
which
coralie
made
her
first
appearance
at
the
gymnase
was
a
piece
of
the
kind
which
sometimes
falls
flat
at
first
and
afterwards
has
immense
success
it
fell
flat
that
night
coralie
was
not
applauded
when
she
came
on
and
the
chilly
reception
reacted
upon
her
the
only
applause
came
from
camusot
s
box
and
various
persons
posted
in
the
balcony
and
galleries
silenced
camusot
with
repeated
cries
of
hush
the
galleries
even
silenced
the
when
they
led
off
with
exaggerated
salvos
martainville
applauded
bravely
nathan
merlin
and
the
treacherous
florine
followed
his
example
but
it
was
clear
that
the
piece
was
a
failure
a
crowd
gathered
in
coralie
s
and
consoled
her
till
she
had
no
courage
left
she
went
home
in
despair
less
for
her
own
sake
than
for
lucien
s
braulard
has
betrayed
us
lucien
said
coralie
was
heartstricken
the
next
day
found
her
in
a
high
fever
utterly
unfit
to
play
face
to
face
with
the
thought
that
she
had
been
cut
short
in
her
career
lucien
hid
the
papers
from
her
and
looked
them
over
in
the
the
reviewers
one
and
all
attributed
the
failure
of
the
piece
to
coralie
she
had
overestimated
her
strength
she
might
be
the
delight
of
a
boulevard
audience
but
she
was
out
of
her
element
at
the
gymnase
she
had
been
inspired
by
a
laudable
ambition
but
she
had
not
taken
her
powers
into
account
she
had
chosen
a
part
to
which
she
was
quite
unequal
lucien
read
on
through
a
pile
of
put
together
on
the
same
system
as
his
attack
upon
nathan
milo
of
crotona
when
he
found
his
hands
fast
in
the
oak
which
he
himself
had
cleft
was
not
more
furious
than
lucien
he
grew
haggard
with
rage
his
friends
gave
coralie
the
most
treacherous
advice
in
the
language
of
kindly
counsel
and
friendly
interest
she
should
play
according
to
these
authorities
all
kind
of
roles
which
the
treacherous
writers
of
these
unblushing
knew
to
be
utterly
unsuited
to
her
genius
and
these
were
the
royalist
papers
led
off
by
nathan
as
for
the
liberal
press
all
the
weapons
which
lucien
had
used
were
now
turned
against
him
coralie
heard
a
sob
followed
by
another
and
another
she
sprang
out
of
bed
to
find
lucien
and
saw
the
papers
nothing
would
satisfy
her
but
she
must
read
them
all
and
when
she
had
read
them
she
went
back
to
bed
and
lay
there
in
silence
florine
was
in
the
plot
she
had
foreseen
the
outcome
she
had
studied
coralie
s
part
and
was
ready
to

the
management
unwilling
to
give
up
the
piece
was
ready
to
take
florine
in
coralie
s
stead
when
the
manager
came
he
found
poor
coralie
sobbing
and
exhausted
on
her
bed
but
when
he
began
to
say
in
lucien
s
presence
that
florine
knew
the
part
and
that
the
play
must
be
given
that
evening
coralie
sprang
up
at
once
i
will
play
she
cried
and
sank
fainting
on
the
floor
so
florine
took
the
part
and
made
her
reputation
in
it
for
the
piece
succeeded
the
newspapers
all
sang
her
praises
and
from
that
time
forth
florine
was
the
great
actress
whom
we
all
know
florine
s
success
exasperated
lucien
to
the
highest
degree
a
wretched
girl
whom
you
helped
to
earn
her
bread

to

nonsense

looking
at
him
with
wan
eyes
nonsense
repeated

very
well
wait
a
few
days
and
you
shall
live
in
a
fine
house

shall
have

and
i
will

a
part
for
you
he
took
two
thousand
francs
and
hurried
to
frascati
s
for
seven
hours
the
unhappy
victim
of
the
furies
watched
his
varying
luck
and
outwardly
seemed
cool
and
he
experienced
both
extremes
of
fortune
during
that
day
and
part
of
the
night
that
followed
at
one
time
he
possessed
as
much
as
thirty
thousand
francs
and
he
came
out
at
last
without
a
sou
in
the
rue
de

he
found
finot
waiting
for
him
with
a
request
for
one
of
his
short
articles
lucien
so
far
forgot
himself
that
he
complained
oh
it
is
not
all
rosy
returned
finot
you
made
your
in
such
a
way
that
you
were
bound
to
lose
the
support
of
the
liberal
press
and
the
liberals
are
far
stronger
in
print
than
all
the
ministerialist
and
royalist
papers
put
together
a
man
should
never
leave
one
camp
for
another
until
he
has
made
a
comfortable
berth
for
himself
by
way
of
consolation
for
the
losses
that
he
must
expect
and
in
any
case
a
prudent
politician
will
see
his
friends
first
and
give
them
his
reasons
for
going
over
and
take
their
opinions
you
can
still
act
together
they
sympathize
with
you
and
you
agree
to
give
mutual
help

before
they
went
over

out

you
were
as
innocent
as

you
will
be
forced
to
show
your
teeth
to
your
new
party
to
make
anything
out
of

you
have
been
necessarily
sacrificed
to
nathan
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
that
your
article
on

has
roused
a
terrific
hubbub
marat
is
a
saint
compared
with
you
you
will
be
attacked
and
your
book
will
be
a
failure
how
far
have
things
gone
with

romance
these
are
the
last
proof
all
the
anonymous
articles
against
that
young

in
the
ministerialist
and

papers
are
set
down
to
you
the
is
poking
fun
at
the
set
in
the
rue

the
hits
are
the
more
telling
because
they
are
funny
there
is
a
whole
serious
political
coterie
at
the
back
of
leon

s
paper
they
will
come
into
power
too
sooner
or
i
have
not
written
a
line
in
the
this
week
very
well
keep
my
short
articles
in
mind
write
fifty
of
them
straight
off
and
i
will
pay
you
for
them
in
a
lump
but
they
must
be
of
the
same
color
as
the
and
finot
with
seeming
carelessness
gave
lucien
an
edifying
anecdote
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
a
piece
of
current
gossip
he
said
for
the
subject
of
one
of
the
papers
eager
to
retrieve
his
losses
at
play
lucien
shook
off
his
dejection
summoned
up
his
energy
and
youthful
force
and
wrote
thirty
articles
of
two
columns
each
these
finished
he
went
to
dauriat
s
partly
because
he
felt
sure
of
meeting
finot
there
and
he
wished
to
give
the
articles
to
finot
in
person
partly
because
he
wished
for
an
explanation
of
the
of
the
he
found
the
bookseller
s
shop
full
of
his
enemies
all
the
talk
immediately
ceased
as
he
entered
put
under
the
ban
of
journalism
his
courage
rose
and
once
more
he
said
to
himself
as
he
had
said
in
the
alley
at
the
luxembourg
i
will
dauriat
was
neither
amiable
or
inclined
to
patronize
he
was
sarcastic
in
tone
and
determined
not
to
bate
an
inch
of
his
rights
the
should
appear
when
it
suited
his
purpose
he
should
wait
until
lucien
was
in
a
position
to
secure
the
success
of
the
book
it
was
his
he
had
bought
it
outright
when
lucien
asserted
that
dauriat
was
bound
to
publish
the
by
the
very
nature
of
the
contract
and
the
relative
positions
of
the
parties
to
the
agreement
dauriat
flatly
contradicted
him
said
that
no
publisher
could
be
compelled
by
law
to
publish
at
a
loss
and
that
he
himself
was
the
best
judge
of
the
expediency
of
producing
the
book
there
was
besides
a
remedy
open
to
lucien
as
any
court
of
law
would
admit
the
poet
was
quite
welcome
to
take
his
verses
to
a
royalist
publisher
upon
the
repayment
of
the
thousand
crowns
lucien
went
away
dauriat
s
moderate
tone
had
exasperated
him
even
more
than
his
previous
arrogance
at
their
first
interview
so
the
would
not
appear
until
lucien
had
found
a
host
of
formidable
supporters
or
grown
formidable
himself
he
walked
home
slowly
so
oppressed
and
out
of
heart
that
he
felt
ready
for
suicide
coralie
lay
in
bed
looking
white
and
she
must
have
a
part
or
she
will
die
said
berenice
as
lucien
dressed
for
a
great
evening
party
at
mlle
des
touches
house
in
the
rue
du
mont
blanc
des
lupeaulx
and
vignon
and
blondet
were
to
be
there
as
well
as
mme
d
espard
and
mme
de
bargeton
the
party
was
given
in
honor
of
conti
the
great
composer
owner
likewise
of
one
of
the
most
famous
voices
off
the
stage
cinti
pasta
garcia
levasseur
and
two
or
three
celebrated
amateurs
in
society
not
excepted
lucien
saw
the
marquise
her
cousin
and
mme
de
montcornet
sitting
together
and
made
one
of
the
party
the
unhappy
young
fellow
to
all
appearances
was
happy
and
content
he
jested
he
was
the
lucien
de
rubempre
of
his
days
of
splendor
he
would
not
seem
to
need
help
from
any
one
he
dwelt
on
his
services
to
the
royalist
party
and
cited
the
hue
and
cry
raised
after
him
by
the
liberal
press
as
a
proof
of
his
zeal
and
you
will
be
well
rewarded
my
friend
said
mme
de
bargeton
with
a
gracious
smile
go
to
the
the
day
after
with
the
heron
and
des
lupeaulx
and
you
will
find
your
patent
signed
by
his
majesty
the
keeper
of
the
seals
will
take
it
to
the
tuileries
but
there
is
to
be
a
meeting
of
the
council
and
he
will
not
come
back
till
late
still
if
i
hear
the
result
evening
i
will
let
you
know
where
are
you
living
i
will
come
to
you
said
lucien
ashamed
to
confess
that
he
was
living
in
the
rue
de
la
lune
the
duc
de
lenoncourt
and
the
duc
de
navarreins
have
made
mention
of
you
to
the
king
added
the
marquise
they
praised
your
absolute
and
entire
devotion
and
said
that
some
distinction
ought
to
avenge
your
treatment
in
the
liberal
press
the
name
and
title
of
rubempre
to
which
you
have
a
claim
through
your
mother
would
become
illustrious
through
you
they
said
the
king
gave
his
lordship
instructions
that
evening
to
prepare
a
patent
authorizing
the
sieur
lucien
chardon
to
bear
the
arms
and
title
of
the
comtes
de
rubempre
as
grandson
of
the
last
count
by
the
mother
s
side
let
us
favor
the
songsters
of
pindus
said
his
majesty
after
reading
your
sonnet
on
the
lily
which
my
cousin
luckily
remembered
to
give
the
especially
when
the
king
can
work
miracles
and
change
the
into
an
eagle
de
navarreins
lucien
s
expansion
of
feeling
would
have
softened
the
heart
of
any
woman
less
deeply
wounded
than
louise
d
espard
de
negrepelisse
but
her
thirst
for
vengeance
was
only
increased
by
lucien
s
graciousness
des
lupeaulx
was
right
lucien
was
wanting
in
tact
it
never
crossed
his
mind
that
this
history
of
the
patent
was
one
of
the
mystifications
at
which
mme
d
espard
was
an
adept
emboldened
with
success
and
the
flattering
distinction
shown
to
him
by
mlle
des
touches
he
stayed
till
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
for
a
word
in
private
with
his
hostess
lucien
had
learned
in
royalist
newspaper
offices
that
mlle
des
touches
was
the
author
of
a
play
in
which
petite
the
marvel
of
the
moment
was
about
to
appear
as
the
rooms
emptied
he
drew
mlle
des
touches
to
a
sofa
in
the
boudoir
and
told
the
story
of
coralie
s
misfortune
and
his
own
so
touchingly
that
mlle
des
touches
promised
to
give
the
heroine
s
part
to
his
friend
that
promise
put
new
life
into
coralie
but
the
next
day
as
they
breakfasted
together
lucien
opened
lousteau
s
newspaper
and
found
that
unlucky
anecdote
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
and
his
wife
the
story
was
full
of
the
blackest
malice
lurking
in
the
most
caustic
wit
louis
xviii
was
brought
into
the
story
in
a
masterly
fashion
and
held
up
to
ridicule
in
such
a
way
that
prosecution
was
impossible
here
is
the
substance
of
a
fiction
for
which
the
liberal
party
attempted
to
win
credence
though
they
only
succeeded
in
adding
one
more
to
the
tale
of
their
ingenious
calumnies
the
king
s
passion
for
notes
and
a
correspondence
full
of
madrigals
and
sparkling
wit
was
declared
to
be
the
last
phase
of
the
tender
passion
love
had
reached
the
doctrinaire
stage
or
had
passed
in
other
words
from
the
concrete
to
the
abstract
the
illustrious
lady
so
cruelly
ridiculed
under
the
name
of
octavie
by
beranger
had
conceived
so
it
was
said
the
gravest
fears
the
correspondence
was
languishing
the
more
octavie
displayed
her
wit
the
cooler
grew
the
royal
lover
at
last
octavie
discovered
the
cause
of
her
decline
her
power
was
threatened
by
the
novelty
and
piquancy
of
a
correspondence
between
the
august
scribe
and
the
wife
of
his
keeper
of
the
seals
that
excellent
woman
was
believed
to
be
incapable
of
writing
a
note
she
was
simply
and
solely
godmother
to
the
efforts
of
audacious
ambition
who
could
be
hidden
behind
her
petticoats
octavie
decided
after
making
observations
of
her
own
that
the
king
was
corresponding
with
his
minister
she
laid
her
plans
with
the
help
of
a
faithful
friend
she
arranged
that
a
stormy
debate
should
detain
the
minister
at
the
chamber
then
she
contrived
to
secure
a
and
to
convince
outraged
majesty
of
the
fraud
louis
xviii
flew
into
a
royal
and
truly
bourbon
passion
but
the
tempest
broke
on
octavie
s
head
he
would
not
believe
her
octavie
offered
immediate
proof
begging
the
king
to
write
a
note
which
must
be
answered
at
once
the
unlucky
wife
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
sent
to
the
chamber
for
her
husband
but
precautions
had
been
taken
and
at
that
moment
the
minister
was
on
his
legs
addressing
the
chamber
the
lady
racked
her
brains
and
replied
to
the
note
with
such
intellect
as
she
could
improvise
your
chancellor
will
supply
the
rest
cried
octavie
laughing
at
the
king
s
chagrin
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
the
story
but
it
struck
home
to
three
persons
the
keeper
of
the
seals
his
wife
and
the
king
it
was
said
that
des
lupeaulx
had
invented
the
tale
but
finot
always
kept
his
counsel
the
article
was
caustic
and
clever
the
liberal
papers
and
the
orleanists
were
delighted
with
it
and
lucien
himself
laughed
and
thought
of
it
merely
as
a
very
amusing
he
called
next
day
for
des
lupeaulx
and
the
baron
du
chatelet
the
baron
had
just
been
to
thank
his
lordship
the
sieur
chatelet
newly
appointed
councillor
extraordinary
was
now
comte
du
chatelet
with
a
promise
of
the
prefecture
of
the
charente
so
soon
as
the
present
prefect
should
have
completed
the
term
of
office
necessary
to
receive
the
maximum
retiring
pension
the
comte
chatelet
for
the
had
been
inserted
in
the
patent
drove
with
lucien
to
the
and
treated
his
companion
as
an
equal
but
for
lucien
s
articles
he
said
his
patent
would
not
have
been
granted
so
soon
liberal
persecution
had
been
a
to
advancement
des
lupeaulx
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
s
office
that
functionary
started
with
surprise
when
lucien
appeared
and
looked
at
des
lupeaulx
what
he
exclaimed
to
lucien
s
utter
bewilderment
do
you
dare
to
come
here
sir
your
patent
was
made
out
but
his
lordship
has
torn
it
up
here
it
is
the
caught
up
the
first
torn
sheet
that
came
to
hand
the
minister
wished
to
discover
the
author
of
yesterday
s
atrocious
article
and
here
is
the
manuscript
added
the
speaker
holding
out
the
sheets
of
lucien
s
article
you
call
yourself
a
royalist
sir
and
you
are
on
the
staff
of
that
detestable
paper
which
turns
the
minister
s
hair
gray
harasses
the
centre
and
is
dragging
the
country
headlong
to
ruin
you
breakfast
on
the
the
the
and
the
you
dine
on
the
and
the
and
then
sup
with
martainville
the
worst
enemy
of
the
government
martainville
urges
the
government
on
to
absolutist
measures
he
is
more
likely
to
bring
on
another
revolution
than
if
he
had
gone
over
to
the
extreme
left
you
are
a
very
clever
journalist
but
you
will
never
make
a
politician
the
minister
denounced
you
to
the
king
and
the
king
was
so
angry
that
he
scolded
le
duc
de
navarreins
his
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
your
enemies
will
be
all
the
more
formidable
because
they
have
hitherto
been
your
friends
conduct
that
one
expects
from
an
enemy
is
atrocious
in
a
why
really
my
dear
fellow
are
you
a
child
said
des
lupeaulx
you
have
compromised
me
mme
d
espard
mme
de
bargeton
and
mme
de
montcornet
who
were
responsible
for
you
must
be
furious
the
duke
is
sure
to
have
handed
on
his
annoyance
to
the
marquise
and
the
marquise
will
have
scolded
her
cousin
keep
away
from
them
and
here
comes
his
lordship
go
said
the
lucien
went
out
into
the
place
vendome
he
was
stunned
by
this
bludgeon
blow
he
walked
home
along
the
boulevards
trying
to
think
over
his
position
he
saw
himself
a
plaything
in
the
hands
of
envy
treachery
and
greed
what
was
he
in
this
world
of
contending
ambitions
a
child
sacrificing
everything
to
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
the
gratification
of
vanity
a
poet
whose
thoughts
never
went
beyond
the
moment
a
moth
flitting
from
one
bright
gleaming
object
to
another
he
had
no
definite
aim
he
was
the
slave
of
circumstance
meaning
well
doing
conscience
tortured
him
remorselessly
and
to
crown
it
all
he
was
penniless
and
exhausted
with
work
and
emotion
his
articles
could
not
compare
with
merlin
s
or
nathan
s
work
he
walked
at
random
absorbed
in
these
thoughts
as
he
passed
some
of
the
which
were
already
lending
books
as
well
as
newspapers
a
placard
caught
his
eyes
it
was
an
advertisement
of
a
book
with
a
grotesque
title
but
beneath
the
announcement
he
saw
his
name
in
brilliant
letters
by
lucien
chardon
de
so
his
book
had
come
out
and
he
had
heard
nothing
of
it
all
the
newspapers
were
silent
he
stood
motionless
before
the
placard
his
arms
hanging
at
his
sides
he
did
not
notice
a
little
knot
of
acquaintances
rastignac
and
de
marsay
and
some
other
fashionable
young
men
nor
did
he
see
that
michel
chrestien
and
leon
giraud
were
coming
towards
him
are
you
chardon
it
was
michel
who
spoke
and
there
was
that
in
the
sound
of
his
voice
that
set
lucien
s
heartstrings
vibrating
do
you
not
know
me
he
asked
turning
very
pale
michel
spat
in
his
face
take
that
as
your
wages
for
your
article
against
d
arthez
if
everybody
would
do
as
i
do
on
his
own
or
his
friend
s
behalf
the
press
would
be
as
it
ought
to
be
a
and
respected
lucien
staggered
back
and
caught
hold
of
rastignac
gentlemen
he
said
addressing
rastignac
and
de
marsay
you
will
not
refuse
to
act
as
my
seconds
but
first
i
wish
to
make
matters
even
and
apology
he
struck
michel
a
sudden
unexpected
blow
in
the
face
the
rest
rushed
in
between
the
republican
and
royalist
to
prevent
a
street
brawl
rastignac
dragged
lucien
off
to
the
rue
taitbout
only
a
few
steps
away
from
the
boulevard
de
gand
where
this
scene
took
place
it
was
the
hour
of
dinner
or
a
crowd
would
have
assembled
at
once
de
marsay
came
to
find
lucien
and
the
pair
insisted
that
he
should
dine
with
them
at
the
cafe
anglais
where
they
drank
and
made
merry
are
you
a
good
swordsman
inquired
de
marsay
i
have
never
had
a
foil
in
my
a
good
shot
never
fired
a
pistol
in
my
then
you
have
luck
on
your
side
you
are
a
formidable
antagonist
to
stand
up
to
you
may
kill
your
man
said
de
marsay
fortunately
lucien
found
coralie
in
bed
and
asleep
she
had
played
without
rehearsal
in
a
play
and
taken
her
revenge
she
had
met
with
genuine
applause
her
enemies
had
not
been
prepared
for
this
step
on
her
part
and
her
success
had
determined
the
manager
to
give
her
the
heroine
s
part
in
camille
maupin
s
play
he
had
discovered
the
cause
of
her
apparent
failure
and
was
indignant
with
florine
and
nathan
coralie
should
have
the
protection
of
the
management
at
five
o
clock
that
morning
rastignac
came
for
lucien
the
name
of
your
street
my
dear
fellow
is
particularly
appropriate
for
your
lodgings
you
are
up
in
the
sky
he
said
by
way
of
greeting
let
us
be
first
upon
the
ground
on
the
road
to
clignancourt
it
is
good
form
and
we
ought
to
set
them
an
here
is
the
programme
said
de
marsay
as
the
cab
rattled
through
the
faubourg
you
stand
up
at
paces
coming
nearer
till
you
are
only
fifteen
apart
you
have
each
of
you
five
paces
to
take
and
three
shots
to
fire
no
more
whatever
happens
that
must
be
the
end
of
it
we
load
for
your
antagonist
and
his
seconds
load
for
you
the
weapons
were
chosen
by
the
four
seconds
at
a
gunmaker
s
we
helped
you
to
a
chance
i
will
promise
you
horse
pistols
are
to
be
the
for
lucien
life
had
become
a
bad
dream
he
did
not
care
whether
he
lived
or
died
the
courage
of
suicide
helped
him
in
some
sort
to
carry
things
off
with
a
dash
of
bravado
before
the
spectators
he
stood
in
his
place
he
would
not
take
a
step
a
piece
of
recklessness
which
the
others
took
for
deliberate
calculation
they
thought
the
poet
an
uncommonly
cool
hand
michel
chrestien
came
as
far
as
his
limit
both
fired
twice
and
at
the
same
time
for
either
party
was
considered
to
be
equally
insulted
michel
s
first
bullet
grazed
lucien
s
chin
lucien
s
passed
ten
feet
above
chrestien
s
head
the
second
shot
hit
lucien
s
coat
collar
but
the
buckram
lining
fortunately
saved
its
wearer
the
third
bullet
struck
him
in
the
chest
and
he
dropped
is
he
dead
asked
michel
chrestien
no
said
the
surgeon
he
will
pull
so
much
the
worse
answered
michel
yes
so
much
the
worse
said
lucien
as
his
tears
fell
fast
by
noon
the
unhappy
boy
lay
in
bed
in
his
own
room
with
untold
pains
they
had
managed
to
remove
him
but
it
had
taken
five
hours
to
bring
him
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
his
condition
was
not
dangerous
but
precautions
were
necessary
lest
fever
should
set
in
and
bring
about
troublesome
complications
coralie
choked
down
her
grief
and
anguish
she
sat
up
with
him
at
night
through
the
anxious
weeks
of
his
illness
studying
her
parts
by
his
bedside
lucien
was
in
danger
for
two
long
months
and
often
at
the
theatre
coralie
acted
her
frivolous
role
with
one
thought
in
her
heart
perhaps
he
is
dying
at
this
lucien
owed
his
life
to
the
skill
and
devotion
of
a
friend
whom
he
had
grievously
hurt
bianchon
had
come
to
tend
him
after
hearing
the
story
of
the
attack
from
d
arthez
who
told
it
in
confidence
and
excused
the
unhappy
poet
bianchon
suspected
that
d
arthez
was
generously
trying
to
screen
the
renegade
but
on
questioning
lucien
during
a
lucid
interval
in
the
dangerous
nervous
fever
he
learned
that
his
patient
was
only
responsible
for
the
one
serious
article
in
hector
merlin
s
paper
before
the
first
month
was
out
the
firm
of
fendant
and
cavalier
filed
their
schedule
bianchon
told
coralie
that
lucien
must
on
no
account
hear
the
news
the
famous
of
charles
brought
out
with
an
absurd
title
had
been
a
complete
failure
fendant
being
anxious
to
realize
a
little
ready
money
before
going
into
bankruptcy
had
sold
the
whole
edition
without
cavalier
s
knowledge
to
dealers
in
printed
paper
these
in
their
turn
had
disposed
of
it
at
a
cheap
rate
to
hawkers
and
lucien
s
book
at
that
moment
was
adorning
the
bookstalls
along
the
quays
the
booksellers
on
the
quai
des
augustins
who
had
previously
taken
a
quantity
of
copies
now
discovered
that
after
this
sudden
reduction
of
the
price
they
were
like
to
lose
heavily
on
their
purchases
the
four
duodecimo
volumes
for
which
they
had
paid
four
francs
fifty
centimes
were
being
given
away
for
fifty
sous
great
was
the
outcry
in
the
trade
but
the
newspapers
preserved
a
profound
silence
barbet
had
not
foreseen
this
clearance
he
had
a
belief
in
lucien
s
abilities
for
once
he
had
broken
his
rule
and
taken
two
hundred
copies
the
prospect
of
a
loss
drove
him
frantic
the
things
he
said
of
lucien
were
fearful
to
hear
then
barbet
took
a
heroic
resolution
he
stocked
his
copies
in
a
corner
of
his
shop
with
the
obstinacy
of
greed
and
left
his
competitors
to
sell
their
wares
at
a
loss
two
years
afterwards
when
d
arthez
s
fine
preface
the
merits
of
the
book
and
one
or
two
articles
by
leon
giraud
had
raised
the
value
of
the
book
barbet
sold
his
copies
one
by
one
at
ten
francs
each
lucien
knew
nothing
of
all
this
but
berenice
and
coralie
could
not
refuse
to
allow
hector
merlin
to
see
his
dying
comrade
and
hector
merlin
made
him
drink
drop
by
drop
the
whole
of
the
bitter
draught
brewed
by
the
failure
of
fendant
and
cavalier
made
bankrupts
by
his
first
book
martainville
the
one
friend
who
stood
by
lucien
through
thick
and
thin
had
written
a
magnificent
article
on
his
work
but
so
great
was
the
general
exasperation
against
the
editor
of
and
drapeau
that
his
championship
only
injured
lucien
in
vain
did
the
athlete
return
the
liberal
insults
tenfold
not
a
newspaper
took
up
the
challenge
in
spite
of
all
his
attacks
coralie
berenice
and
bianchon
might
shut
the
door
on
lucien
s
friends
who
raised
a
great
outcry
but
it
was
impossible
to
keep
out
creditors
and
writs
after
the
failure
of
fendant
and
cavalier
their
bills
were
taken
into
bankruptcy
according
to
that
provision
of
the
code
of
commerce
most
inimical
to
the
claims
of
third
parties
who
in
this
way
lose
the
benefit
of
delay
lucien
discovered
that
camusot
was
proceeding
against
him
with
great
energy
when
coralie
heard
the
name
and
for
the
first
time
learned
the
dreadful
and
humiliating
step
which
her
poet
had
taken
for
her
sake
the
angelic
creature
loved
him
ten
times
more
than
before
and
would
not
approach
camusot
the
bailiff
bringing
the
warrant
of
arrest
shrank
back
from
the
idea
of
dragging
his
prisoner
out
of
bed
and
went
back
to
camusot
before
applying
to
the
president
of
the
tribunal
of
commerce
for
an
order
to
remove
the
debtor
to
a
private
hospital
camusot
hurried
at
once
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
and
coralie
went
down
to
him
when
she
came
up
again
she
held
the
warrants
in
which
lucien
was
described
as
a
tradesman
in
her
hand
how
had
she
obtained
those
papers
from
camusot
what
promise
had
she
given
coralie
kept
a
sad
gloomy
silence
but
when
she
returned
she
looked
as
if
all
the
life
had
gone
out
of
her
she
played
in
camille
maupin
s
play
and
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
success
of
that
illustrious
literary
hermaphrodite
but
the
creation
of
this
character
was
the
last
flicker
of
a
bright
dying
lamp
on
the
twentieth
night
when
lucien
had
so
far
recovered
that
he
had
regained
his
appetite
and
could
walk
abroad
and
talked
of
getting
to
work
again
coralie
broke
down
a
secret
trouble
was
weighing
upon
her
berenice
always
believed
that
she
had
promised
to
go
back
to
camusot
to
save
lucien
another
mortification
followed
coralie
was
obliged
to
see
her
part
given
to
florine
nathan
had
threatened
the
gymnase
with
war
if
the
management
refused
to
give
the
vacant
place
to
coralie
s
rival
coralie
had
persisted
till
she
could
play
no
longer
knowing
that
florine
was
waiting
to
step
into
her
place
she
had
overtasked
her
strength
the
gymnase
had
advanced
sums
during
lucien
s
illness
she
had
no
money
to
draw
lucien
eager
to
work
though
he
was
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
write
and
he
helped
besides
to
nurse
coralie
and
to
relieve
berenice
from
poverty
they
had
come
to
utter
distress
but
in
bianchon
they
found
a
skilful
and
devoted
doctor
who
obtained
credit
for
them
of
the
druggist
the
landlord
of
the
house
and
the
tradespeople
knew
by
this
time
how
matters
stood
the
furniture
was
attached
the
tailor
and
dressmaker
no
longer
stood
in
awe
of
the
journalist
and
proceeded
to
extremes
and
at
last
no
one
with
the
exception
of
the
and
the
druggist
gave
the
two
unlucky
children
credit
for
a
week
or
more
all
three
of
them
lucien
berenice
and
the
invalid
were
obliged
to
live
on
the
various
ingenious
preparations
sold
by
the
the
inflammatory
diet
was
little
suited
to
the
sick
girl
and
coralie
grew
worse
sheer
want
compelled
lucien
to
ask
lousteau
for
a
return
of
the
loan
of
a
thousand
francs
lost
at
play
by
the
friend
who
had
deserted
him
in
his
hour
of
need
perhaps
amid
all
his
troubles
this
step
cost
him
most
cruel
suffering
lousteau
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
rue
de
la
harpe
hunted
down
like
a
hare
he
was
lodging
now
with
this
friend
now
with
that
lucien
found
him
at
last
at
flicoteaux
s
he
was
sitting
at
the
very
table
at
which
lucien
had
found
him
that
evening
when
for
his
misfortune
he
forsook
d
arthez
for
journalism
lousteau
offered
him
dinner
and
lucien
accepted
the
offer
as
they
came
out
of
flicoteaux
s
with
claude
vignon
who
happened
to
be
dining
there
that
day
and
the
great
man
in
obscurity
who
kept
his
wardrobe
at
samanon
s
the
four
among
them
could
not
produce
enough
specie
to
pay
for
a
cup
of
coffee
at
the
cafe
voltaire
they
lounged
about
the
luxembourg
in
the
hope
of
meeting
with
a
publisher
and
as
it
fell
out
they
met
with
one
of
the
most
famous
printers
of
the
day
lousteau
borrowed
forty
francs
of
him
and
divided
the
money
into
four
equal
parts
misery
had
brought
down
lucien
s
pride
and
extinguished
sentiment
he
shed
tears
as
he
told
the
story
of
his
troubles
but
each
one
of
his
comrades
had
a
tale
as
cruel
as
his
own
and
when
the
three
versions
had
been
given
it
seemed
to
the
poet
that
he
was
the
least
unfortunate
among
the
four
all
of
them
craved
a
respite
from
remembrance
and
thoughts
which
made
trouble
doubly
hard
to
bear
lousteau
hurried
to
the
palais
royal
to
gamble
with
his
remaining
nine
francs
the
great
man
unknown
to
fame
though
he
had
a
divine
mistress
must
needs
hie
him
to
a
low
haunt
of
vice
to
wallow
in
perilous
pleasure
vignon
betook
himself
to
the
de
to
drown
memory
and
thought
in
a
couple
of
bottles
of
bordeaux
lucien
parted
company
with
him
on
the
threshold
declining
to
share
that
supper
when
he
shook
hands
with
the
one
journalist
who
had
not
been
hostile
to
him
it
was
with
a
cruel
pang
in
his
heart
what
shall
i
do
he
asked
aloud
one
must
do
as
one
can
the
great
critic
said
your
book
is
good
but
it
excited
jealousy
and
your
struggle
will
be
hard
and
long
genius
is
a
cruel
disease
every
writer
carries
a
canker
in
his
heart
a
devouring
monster
like
the
tapeworm
in
the
stomach
which
destroys
all
feeling
as
it
arises
in
him
which
is
the
stronger
the
man
or
the
disease
one
has
need
be
a
great
man
truly
to
keep
the
balance
between
genius
and
character
the
talent
grows
the
heart
withers
unless
a
man
is
a
giant
unless
he
has
the
thews
of
a
hercules
he
must
be
content
either
to
lose
his
gift
or
to
live
without
a
heart
you
are
slender
and
fragile
you
will
give
way
he
added
as
he
turned
into
the
restaurant
lucien
returned
home
thinking
over
that
terrible
verdict
he
beheld
the
life
of
literature
by
the
light
of
the
profound
truths
uttered
by
vignon
money
money
a
voice
cried
in
his
ears
then
he
drew
three
bills
of
a
thousand
francs
each
due
respectively
in
one
two
and
three
months
imitating
the
handwriting
of
his
david
sechard
with
admirable
skill
he
endorsed
the
bills
and
took
them
next
morning
to
metivier
the
in
the
rue
serpente
who
made
no
difficulty
about
taking
them
lucien
wrote
a
few
lines
to
give
his
notice
of
this
assault
upon
his
promising
as
usual
in
such
cases
to
be
ready
to
meet
the
bills
as
they
fell
due
when
all
debts
his
own
and
coralie
s
were
paid
he
put
the
three
hundred
francs
which
remained
into
berenice
s
hands
bidding
her
to
refuse
him
money
if
he
asked
her
for
it
he
was
afraid
of
a
return
of
the
gambler
s
frenzy
lucien
worked
away
gloomily
in
a
sort
of
cold
speechless
fury
putting
forth
all
his
powers
into
witty
articles
written
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
at
coralie
s
bedside
whenever
he
looked
up
in
search
of
ideas
his
eyes
fell
on
that
beloved
face
white
as
porcelain
fair
with
the
beauty
that
belongs
to
the
dying
and
he
saw
a
smile
on
her
pale
lips
and
her
eyes
grown
bright
with
a
more
consuming
pain
than
physical
suffering
always
turned
on
his
face
lucien
sent
in
his
work
but
he
could
not
leave
the
house
to
worry
editors
and
his
articles
did
not
appear
when
he
at
last
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
the
office
he
met
with
a
cool
reception
from
theodore
gaillard
who
had
advanced
him
money
and
turned
his
literary
diamonds
to
good
account
afterwards
take
care
my
dear
fellow
you
are
falling
off
he
said
you
must
not
let
yourself
down
your
work
wants
inspiration
that
little
lucien
has
written
himself
out
with
his
romance
and
his
first
articles
cried
felicien
vernou
merlin
and
the
whole
chorus
of
his
enemies
whenever
his
name
came
up
at
dauriat
s
or
the
vaudeville
the
work
he
is
sending
us
is
to
have
written
oneself
out
in
the
slang
of
journalism
is
a
verdict
very
hard
to
live
down
it
passed
everywhere
from
mouth
to
mouth
ruining
lucien
all
unsuspicious
as
he
was
and
indeed
his
burdens
were
too
heavy
for
his
strength
in
the
midst
of
a
heavy
strain
of
work
he
was
sued
for
the
bills
which
he
had
drawn
in
david
sechard
s
name
he
had
recourse
to
camusot
s
experience
and
coralie
s
sometime
adorer
was
generous
enough
to
assist
the
man
she
loved
the
intolerable
situation
lasted
for
two
whole
months
the
days
being
diversified
by
stamped
papers
handed
over
to
desroches
a
friend
of
bixiou
blondet
and
des
lupeaulx
early
in
august
bianchon
told
them
that
coralie
s
condition
was
hopeless
she
had
only
a
few
days
to
live
those
days
were
spent
in
tears
by
berenice
and
lucien
they
could
not
hide
their
grief
from
the
dying
girl
and
she
was
for
lucien
s
sake
some
strange
change
was
working
in
coralie
she
would
have
lucien
bring
a
priest
she
must
be
reconciled
to
the
church
and
die
in
peace
coralie
died
as
a
christian
her
repentance
was
sincere
her
agony
and
death
took
all
energy
and
heart
out
of
lucien
he
sank
into
a
low
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
till
death
brought
the
end
of
her
suffering
it
was
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
some
lighting
upon
a
on
the
twittered
a
few
notes
berenice
kneeling
by
the
bedside
was
covering
a
hand
fast
growing
cold
with
kisses
and
tears
on
the
there
lay
eleven
sous
lucien
went
out
despair
made
him
beg
for
money
to
lay
coralie
in
her
grave
he
had
wild
thoughts
of
flinging
himself
at
the
marquise
d
espard
s
feet
of
entreating
the
comte
du
chatelet
mme
de
bargeton
mlle
des
touches
nay
that
terrible
dandy
of
a
de
marsay
all
his
pride
had
gone
with
his
strength
he
would
have
enlisted
as
a
common
soldier
at
that
moment
for
money
he
walked
on
with
a
slouching
feverish
gait
known
to
all
the
unhappy
reached
camille
maupin
s
house
entered
careless
of
his
disordered
dress
and
sent
in
a
message
he
entreated
mlle
des
touches
to
see
him
for
a
moment
mademoiselle
only
went
to
bed
at
three
o
clock
this
morning
said
the
servant
and
no
one
would
dare
to
disturb
her
until
she
when
does
she
ring
never
before
ten
o
then
lucien
wrote
one
of
those
harrowing
appeals
in
which
the
beggar
flings
all
pride
and
to
the
winds
one
evening
not
so
very
long
ago
when
lousteau
had
told
him
of
the
abject
begging
letters
which
finot
received
lucien
had
thought
it
impossible
that
any
creature
would
sink
so
low
and
now
carried
away
by
his
pen
he
had
gone
further
it
may
be
than
other
unlucky
wretches
upon
the
same
road
he
did
not
suspect
in
his
fever
and
imbecility
that
he
had
just
written
a
masterpiece
of
pathos
on
his
way
home
along
the
boulevards
he
met
barbet
barbet
he
begged
holding
out
his
hand
five
hundred
francs
no
two
hundred
returned
the
other
ah
then
you
have
a
yes
but
i
am
a
man
of
business
as
well
i
have
lost
a
lot
of
money
through
you
he
concluded
after
giving
the
history
of
the
failure
of
fendant
and
cavalier
will
you
put
me
in
the
way
of
making
some
lucien
quivered
you
are
a
poet
you
ought
to
understand
all
kinds
of
poetry
continued
the
little
publisher
i
want
a
few
rollicking
songs
at
this
moment
to
put
along
with
some
more
by
different
authors
or
they
will
be
down
upon
me
over
the
copyright
i
want
to
have
a
good
collection
to
sell
on
the
streets
at
ten
sous
if
you
care
to
let
me
have
ten
good
by
morning
or
something
spicy
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
eh
i
will
pay
you
two
hundred
when
lucien
returned
home
he
found
coralie
stretched
out
straight
and
stiff
on
a
berenice
with
many
tears
had
wrapped
her
in
a
coarse
linen
sheet
and
put
lighted
candles
at
the
four
corners
of
the
bed
coralie
s
face
had
taken
that
strange
delicate
beauty
of
death
which
so
vividly
impresses
the
living
with
the
idea
of
absolute
calm
she
looked
like
some
white
girl
in
a
decline
it
seemed
as
if
those
pale
crimson
lips
must
open
and
murmur
the
name
which
had
blended
with
the
name
of
god
in
the
last
words
that
she
uttered
before
she
died
lucien
told
berenice
to
order
a
funeral
which
should
not
cost
more
than
two
hundred
francs
including
the
service
at
the
shabby
little
church
of
the
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
out
he
sat
down
to
a
table
and
beside
the
dead
body
of
his
love
he
composed
ten
rollicking
songs
to
fit
popular
airs
the
effort
cost
him
untold
anguish
but
at
last
the
brain
began
to
work
at
the
bidding
of
necessity
as
if
suffering
were
not
and
already
lucien
had
learned
to
put
claude
vignon
s
terrible
maxims
in
practice
and
to
raise
a
barrier
between
heart
and
brain
what
a
night
the
poor
boy
spent
over
those
drinking
songs
writing
by
the
light
of
the
tall
wax
candles
while
the
priest
recited
the
prayers
for
the
dead
morning
broke
before
the
last
song
was
finished
lucien
tried
it
over
to
a
of
the
day
to
the
consternation
of
berenice
and
the
priest
who
thought
that
he
was
mad
lads
tis
tedious
waste
of
time
to
mingle
song
and
reason
folly
calls
for
laughing
rhyme
sense
is
out
of
season
let
apollo
be
forgot
when
bacchus
fills
the
any
catch
is
good
i
wot
if
good
fellows
take
it
up
let
philosophers
protest
let
us
laugh
and
quaff
and
a
fig
for
the
rest
as
hippocrates
has
said
every
jolly
fellow
when
a
century
has
sped
still
is
fit
and
mellow
no
more
following
of
a
lass
with
the
palsy
in
your
legs
while
your
hand
can
hold
a
glass
you
can
drain
it
to
the
dregs
with
an
undiminished
zest
let
us
laugh
and
quaff
and
a
fig
for
the
rest
whence
we
come
we
know
full
well
whiter
are
we

take
the

that

let

and

he
was
shouting
the
reckless
refrain
when
d
arthez
and
bianchon
arrived
to
find
him
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
and
exhaustion
utterly
unable
to
make
a
fair
copy
of
his
verses
a
torrent
of
tears
followed
and
when
amid
his
sobs
he
had
told
his
story
he
saw
the
tears
standing
in
his
friends
eyes
this
wipes
out
many
sins
said
d
arthez
happy
are
they
who
suffer
for
their
sins
in
this
world
the
priest
said
solemnly
at
the
sight
of
the
fair
dead
face
smiling
at
eternity
while
coralie
s
lover
wrote
to
buy
a
grave
for
her
and
barbet
paid
for
the
coffin
of
the
four
candles
lighted
about
the
dead
body
of
her
who
had
thrilled
a
great
audience
as
she
stood
behind
the
footlights
in
her
spanish
basquina
and
scarlet
stockings
while
beyond
in
the
doorway
stood
the
priest
who
had
reconciled
the
dying
actress
with
god
now
about
to
return
to
the
church
to
say
a
mass
for
the
soul
of
her
who
had
loved
much
all
the
grandeur
and
the
sordid
aspects
of
the
scene
all
that
sorrow
crushed
under
by
necessity
froze
the
blood
of
the
great
writer
and
the
great
doctor
they
sat
down
neither
of
them
could
utter
a
word
just
at
that
moment
a
servant
in
livery
announced
mlle
des
touches
that
beautiful
and
noble
woman
understood
everything
at
once
she
stepped
quickly
across
the
room
to
lucien
and
slipped
two
notes
into
his
hand
as
she
grasped
it
it
is
too
late
he
said
looking
up
at
her
with
dull
hopeless
eyes
the
three
stayed
with
lucien
trying
to
soothe
his
despair
with
comforting
words
but
every
spring
seemed
to
be
broken
at
noon
all
the
brotherhood
with
the
exception
of
michel
chrestien
who
however
had
learned
the
truth
as
to
lucien
s
treachery
was
assembled
in
the
poor
little
church
of
the
mlle
de
touches
was
present
and
berenice
and
coralie
s
dresser
from
the
theatre
with
a
couple
of
supernumeraries
and
the
disconsolate
camusot
all
the
men
accompanied
the
actress
to
her
last
in
pere
lachaise
camusot
shedding
hot
tears
had
solemnly
promised
lucien
to
buy
the
grave
in
perpetuity
and
to
put
a
headstone
above
it
with
the
words
coralie
aged
nineteen
years
august
lucien
stayed
there
on
the
sloping
ground
that
looks
out
over
paris
until
the
sun
had
set
who
will
love
me
now
he
thought
my
truest
friends
despise
me
whatever
i
might
have
done
she
who
lies
here
would
have
thought
me
wholly
noble
and
good
i
have
no
one
left
to
me
now
but
my
sister
and
mother
and
david
and
what
do
they
think
of
me
at
home
poor
distinguished
provincial
he
went
back
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
but
the
sight
of
the
rooms
was
so
acutely
painful
that
he
could
not
stay
in
them
and
he
took
a
cheap
lodging
elsewhere
in
the
same
street
mlle
des
touches
two
thousand
francs
and
the
sale
of
the
furniture
paid
the
debts
berenice
had
two
hundred
francs
left
on
which
they
lived
for
two
months
lucien
was
prostrate
he
could
neither
write
nor
think
he
gave
way
to
morbid
grief
berenice
took
pity
upon
him
suppose
that
you
were
to
go
back
to
your
own
country
how
are
you
to
get
there
she
asked
one
day
by
way
of
reply
to
an
exclamation
of
lucien
s
on
but
even
so
you
must
live
and
sleep
on
the
way
even
if
you
walk
twelve
leagues
a
day
you
will
want
twenty
francs
at
i
will
get
them
together
he
said
he
took
his
clothes
and
his
best
linen
keeping
nothing
but
strict
necessaries
and
went
to
samanon
who
offered
fifty
francs
for
his
entire
wardrobe
in
vain
he
begged
the
to
let
him
have
enough
to
pay
his
fare
by
the
coach
samanon
was
inexorable
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
lucien
rushed
to
frascati
s
staked
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
and
lost
every
farthing
back
once
more
in
the
wretched
room
in
the
rue
de
la
lune
he
asked
berenice
for
coralie
s
shawl
the
good
girl
looked
at
him
and
knew
in
a
moment
what
he
meant
to
do
he
had
confessed
to
his
loss
at
the
and
now
he
was
going
to
hang
himself
are
you
mad
sir
go
out
for
a
walk
and
come
back
again
at
midnight
i
will
get
the
money
for
you
but
keep
to
the
boulevards
do
not
go
towards
the
lucien
paced
up
and
down
the
boulevards
he
was
stupid
with
grief
he
watched
the
and
the
stream
of
traffic
and
felt
that
he
was
alone
and
a
very
small
atom
in
this
seething
whirlpool
of
paris
churned
by
the
strife
of
innumerable
interests
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
banks
of
his
charente
a
craving
for
happiness
and
home
awoke
in
him
and
with
the
craving
came
one
of
the
sudden
febrile
bursts
of
energy
which
natures
like
his
mistake
for
strength
he
would
not
give
up
until
he
had
poured
out
his
heart
to
david
sechard
and
taken
counsel
of
the
three
good
angels
still
left
to
him
on
earth
as
he
lounged
along
he
caught
sight
of
berenice
berenice
in
her
sunday
clothes
speaking
to
a
stranger
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
lune
and
the
filthy
boulevard
where
she
had
taken
her
stand
what
are
you
doing
asked
lucien
dismayed
by
a
sudden
suspicion
here
are
your
twenty
francs
said
the
girl
slipping
four
pieces
into
the
poet
s
hand
they
may
cost
dear
yet
but
you
can
go
and
she
had
fled
before
lucien
could
see
the
way
she
went
for
in
justice
to
him
it
must
be
said
that
the
money
burned
his
hand
he
wanted
to
return
it
but
he
was
forced
to
keep
it
as
the
final
brand
set
upon
him

life
