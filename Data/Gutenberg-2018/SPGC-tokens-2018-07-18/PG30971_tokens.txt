industrial

ever
think
how
deadly
a
thing
it
is
if
a
machine
has
amnesia

how
easily
it
can

well
yes
amspaugh
admitted
it
was
a
unique
war
in
many
ways
including
its
origin
however
there
are
so
many
analogies
to
other
colonial
revolutions
his
words
trailed
off
as
usual
i
know
earth
mercantile
policies
and
so
forth
said
lindgren
he
fancies
himself
a
student
of
interplanetary
history
this
has
led
to
quite
a
few
arguments
since
amspaugh
who
teaches
in
that
field
joined
the
club
mostly
they
good
i
went
to
the
bar
and
got
myself
another
drink
listening
as
the
mine
owner
big
voice
went
on
but
what
began
it
when
did
the
asterites
first
start
realizing
they
were
pseudopods
of
a
dozen
terrestrial
nations
but
a
single
nation
in
their
own
right
there
the
root
of
the
revolution
and
it
can
be
pinned
down
too
metaphor
cried
someone
at
my
elbow
i
turned
and
saw
missy
blades
she
come
quietly
into
the
lounge
and
started
mixing
a
gin
and
bitters
the
view
window
framed
her
white
head
in
orion
as
she
moved
toward
the
little
cluster
of
seated
men
she
took
a
fat
cigar
from
her
pocket
struck
it
on
her
shoe
sole
and
added
her
special
contribution
to
the
blue
cloud
in
the
room
after
she
sat
down
excuse
me
she
said
i
could
help
that
please
go
on
which
i
hope
relieves
you
of
any
fear
that
she
an
unforgettable
character
oh
yes
she
old
as
satan
now
her
toil
and
guts
and
conniving
make
up
half
the
biography
of
the
sword
she
manned
a
gun
turret
at
ceres
and
was
mate
of
the
on
some
of
the
earliest
saturn
runs
when
men
took
their
lives
between
their
teeth
because
they
needed
both
hands
free
her
sons
and
grandsons
fill
the
belt
with
their
brawling
ventures
she
can
drink
any
ordinary
man
to
the
deck
she
one
of
the
three
women
ever
admitted
to
the
club
but
she
also
one
of
the
few
genuine
ladies
i
known
in
my
life
uh
well
lindgren
grinned
at
her
i
was
saying
missy
the
germ
of
the
revolution
was
when
the
stations
armed
themselves
you
see
that
meant
more
than
police
powers
it
implied
a
degree
of
sovereignty
over
the
years
the
implication
grew
correct
orloff
nodded
his
bald
head
i
remember
how
the
governing
commission
squalled
when
the
station
managers
first
demanded
the
right
they
foresaw
trouble
but
if
the
stations
belonging
to
one
country
put
in
space
weapons
what
else
could
the
others
do
they
should
have
stuck
together
and
all
been
firm
about
refusing
to
allow
it
amspaugh
said
from
the
standpoint
of
their
own
best
interests
i
mean
they
tried
to
orloff
replied
i
hate
to
think
how
many
communications
we
sent
home
from
our
own
office
and
the
others
must
have
done
the
same
but
earth
was
a
long
way
off
the
station
bosses
were
close
inverse
square
law
of
political
pressure
i
grant
you
arming
each
new
little
settlement
proved
important
amspaugh
said
but
really
it
expressed
nothing
more
than
the
first
inchoate
stirrings
of
asteroid
nationalism
and
the
origins
of
that
are
much
more
subtle
and
complex
for
instance
er
you
got
to
have
a
key
event
somewhere
lindgren
insisted
i
say
that
this
was
it
a
silence
fell
as
will
happen
in
conversation
i
came
back
from
the
bar
and
settled
myself
beside
missy
she
looked
for
a
while
into
her
drink
and
then
out
to
the
stars
the
slow
spin
of
our
rock
had
now
brought
the
dippers
into
view
her
faded
eyes
sought
the
pole
star
but
it
earth
not
our
own
any
more
and
i
wondered
what
memories
they
were
sharing
she
shook
herself
the
least
bit
and
said
i
do
know
about
the
sociological
ins
and
outs
all
i
know
is
a
lot
of
things
happened
and
there
was
any
pattern
to
them
at
the
time
we
just
slogged
through
as
best
we
were
able
which
really
very
good
but
i
can
identify
one
of
those
wriggling
roots
for
you
sigurd
i
was
there
when
the
question
of
arming
the
stations
first
came
up
or
rather
when
the
incident
occurred
that
led
directly
to
the
question
being
raised
our
whole
attention
went
to
her
she
did
dwell
on
the
past
as
often
as
we
would
have
liked
a
slow
private
smile
crossed
her
lips
she
looked
beyond
us
again
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
murmured
i
got
my
husband
out
of
it
then
quickly
as
if
to
keep
from
remembering
too
much
do
you
care
to
hear
the
story
it
was
when
the
sword
was
just
getting
started
they
established
themselves
on
ssc
oh
never
mind
the
catalogue
number
sword
enterprises
because
mike
blades
name
suggested
it
what
kind
of
name
could
you
get
out
of
jimmy
chung
even
if
he
was
the
senior
partner
it
sound
too
much
like
a
collision
with
a
meteorite
so
naturally
the
asteroid
also
came
to
be
called
the
sword
they
began
on
the
borrowed
shoestring
that
was
usual
in
those
days
of
course
in
the
belt
a
shoestring
has
to
be
mighty
long
and
finances
got
stretched
to
the
limit
the
older
men
here
will
know
how
much
had
to
be
done
by
hand
in
mortal
danger
because
machines
were
too
expensive
but
in
spite
of
everything
they
succeeded
the
station
was
functional
and
they
were
ready
to
start
business
when
it
was
no
coincidence
that
the
jupiter
craft
were
arriving
steadily
when
the
battleship
came
construction
had
been
scheduled
with
this
in
mind
that
the
sword
should
be
approaching
conjunction
with
the
king
planet
making
direct
shuttle
service
feasible
just
as
the
chemical
plant
went
into
service
we
need
not
consider
how
much
struggle
and
heartbreak
had
gone
into
meeting
that
schedule
as
for
the
battleship
she
appeared
because
the
fact
that
a
station
in
just
this
orbit
was
about
to
commence
operations
was
news
important
enough
to
cross
the
solar
system
and
push
through
many
strata
of
bureaucracy
the
heads
of
the
recently
elected
north
american
government
became
suddenly
fully
aware
of
what
had
been
going
on
michael
blades
was
outside
overseeing
the
installation
of
a
receptor
when
his
earplug
buzzed
he
thrust
his
chin
against
the
tuning
plate
switching
from
gang
to
interoffice
band
mike
said
avis
voice
you
wanted
up
front
now
he
objected
whatever
for
courtesy
visit
from
the
nass
you
lost
track
of
time
my
boy
what
the
the
jumping
blue
blazes
are
you
talking
about
we
had
our
courtesy
visit
jimmy
and
i
both
went
over
to
pay
our
respects
and
we
had
rear
admiral
hulse
here
to
dinner
what
more
do
they
expect
for
harry
sake
do
you
remember
since
there
was
room
to
entertain
his
officers
you
promised
to
take
them
on
a
personal
guided
tour
later
i
made
the
appointment
the
very
next
watch
now
the
hour
oh
yes
it
comes
back
to
me
yeah
hulse
brought
a
magnum
of
champagne
with
him
and
after
so
long
a
time
drinking
recycled
water
my
capacity
was
shot
to
pieces
i
got
a
warm
glow
of
good
fellowship
on
and
offered
let
jimmy
handle
it
i
busy
the
party
too
large
he
says
you
have
to
take
half
of
them
their
gig
will
dock
in
thirty
minutes
well
depute
somebody
else
that
be
rude
mike
have
you
forgotten
how
sensitive
they
are
about
rank
at
home
avis
hesitated
if
what
i
believe
about
the
mood
back
there
is
true
we
can
use
the
good
will
of
navy
personnel
and
any
other
influential
people
in
sight
blades
drew
a
deep
breath
you
too
blinking
sensible
remind
me
to
fire
you
after
i
made
my
first
ten
million
bucks
what
you
do
for
your
next
ten
million
then
snipped
his
cetera
nothing
i
just
squander
the
first
goody
can
i
help
uh
i
be
right
along
blades
switched
off
his
ears
felt
hot
as
often
of
late
when
he
tangled
with
avis
and
he
unlimbered
only
a
few
choice
oaths
troubles
asked
carlos
odonaju
blades
stood
a
moment
looking
around
before
he
answered
he
was
on
the
wide
end
of
the
sword
which
was
shaped
roughly
like
a
truncated
pyramid
beyond
him
and
his
half
dozen
men
stretched
a
vista
of
pitted
rock
jutting
crags
shadows
under
the
glare
of
floodlamps
a
few
kilometers
away
the
farthest
horizon
ended
chopped
off
like
a
cliff
beyond
lay
the
stars
crowding
that
night
which
never
ends
it
grew
very
still
while
the
gang
waited
for
his
word
he
could
listen
to
his
own
lungs
and
pulse
loud
in
the
spacesuit
he
could
even
notice
its
interior
smell
blend
of
plastic
and
oxygen
cycle
chemicals
flesh
and
sweat
he
was
used
to
the
sensation
of
hanging
upside
down
on
the
surface
boots
holding
him
against
that
fractional
gee
by
which
the
asteroid
rotation
overcame
its
feeble
gravity
but
it
came
to
him
that
this
was
an
eerie
way
for
an
oregon
farm
boy
to
stand
oregon
was
long
behind
him
though
not
only
the
food
factory
where
he
grew
up
but
the
coasts
where
he
had
fished
and
the
woods
where
he
had
tramped
no
loss
there
always
been
too
many
tourists
you
escape
from
people
on
earth
cold
and
vacuum
and
raw
rock
and
everything
the
belt
was
better
it
annoyed
him
to
be
interrupted
here
could
carlos
take
over
as
foreman
blades
decided
not
yet
a
gas
receptor
was
an
intricate
piece
of
equipment
carlos
was
a
good
man
of
his
hands
every
one
of
the
in
the
station
necessarily
was
but
he
had
done
this
kind
of
work
often
enough
i
have
to
quit
blades
said
secure
the
stuff
and
report
back
to
buck
meyers
over
at
the
dock
the
lot
of
you
his
crew
putting
in
another
recoil
pier
as
i
suppose
you
know
they
find
jobs
for
you
i
see
you
here
again
on
your
next
watch
he
waved
being
half
the
nominal
ownership
of
this
place
justify
snobbery
when
everyone
must
work
together
or
die
and
stepped
off
toward
the
nearest
entry
lock
with
that
flowing
spaceman
pace
which
always
keeps
one
foot
on
the
ground
even
so
he
unshackle
his
lifeline
till
he
was
inside
the
chamber
on
the
way
he
topped
a
gaunt
ridge
and
had
a
clear
view
of
the
balloons
that
were
attached
to
the
completed
receptors
those
that
were
still
full
bulked
enormous
like
ghostly
moons
the
jovian
gases
that
strained
their
tough
elastomer
did
not
much
blur
the
stars
seen
through
them
but
they
swelled
high
enough
to
catch
the
light
of
the
hidden
sun
and
shimmer
with
it
the
nearly
discharged
balloons
hung
thin
straining
outward
two
full
ones
passed
in
slow
orbit
against
the
constellations
they
were
waiting
to
be
hauled
in
and
coupled
fast
to
release
their
loads
into
the
station
hungry
chemical
plant
but
there
were
not
yet
enough
facilities
to
handle
them
at
once
and
the
would
soon
be
arriving
with
another
blades
found
that
he
needed
a
few
extra
curses
having
cycled
through
the
air
lock
he
removed
his
suit
and
stowed
it
also
the
heavy
gloves
which
kept
him
from
frostbite
as
he
touched
its
exterior
tastefully
clad
in
a
navy
surplus
long
john
he
started
down
the
corridors
now
that
the
first
stage
of
burrowing
within
the
asteroid
had
been
completed
most
passages
went
through
its
body
rather
than
being
plastic
tubes
snaking
across
the
surface
nothing
had
been
done
thus
far
about
facing
them
they
were
merely
shafts
two
meters
square
lined
with
doorways
ventilator
grilles
and
fluoropanels
they
had
no
thermocoils
once
the
mass
had
been
sufficiently
warmed
up
the
waste
heat
of
man
and
his
industry
kept
it
that
way
the
dark
tunnels
throbbed
with
machine
noises
here
and
there
a
girlie
picture
or
a
sentimental
landscape
from
earth
was
posted
men
moved
busily
along
them
bearing
tools
instruments
supplies
they
were
from
numerous
countries
those
men
though
mostly
north
americans
but
they
had
acquired
a
likeness
a
rangy
leathery
look
and
a
stride
that
went
beyond
their
colorful
coveralls
hi
mike
how
she
spinning
hey
mike
you
heard
the
latest
story
about
the
martian
and
the
bishop
can
you
spare
me
a
minute
we
got
troubles
in
the
separator
manifolds
what
the
hurry
mike
your
batteries
overcharged
blades
waved
the
hails
aside
there
was
need
for
haste
you
could
move
fast
indoors
under
the
low
weight
which
became
lower
as
you
approached
the
axis
of
rotation
with
no
fear
of
tumbling
off
but
it
was
several
kilometers
from
the
gas
receptor
end
to
the
people
end
of
the
asteroid
he
rattled
down
a
ladder
and
entered
his
cramped
office
out
of
breath
avis
page
looked
up
from
her
desk
and
wrinkled
her
freckled
snub
nose
at
him
you
ought
to
take
a
shower
but
there
is
time
she
said
here
use
my
antistinker
she
threw
him
a
spray
cartridge
with
a
deft
motion
i
got
your
suit
and
beardex
out
of
your
cabin
have
i
no
privacy
he
grumbled
but
grinned
in
her
direction
she
was
much
to
look
at
not
ugly
just
small
brunette
and
unspectacular
but
she
was
a
supernova
of
an
assistant
make
somebody
a
good
wife
some
day
he
wondered
why
she
had
taken
advantage
of
the
situation
here
to
snaffle
a
husband
a
dozen
women
all
but
two
of
them
married
and
a
hundred
men
was
a
ratio
even
more
lopsided
than
the
norm
in
the
belt
of
course
with
so
much
work
to
do
and
with
everybody
conscious
of
the
need
to
maintain
cordial
relations
sex
did
get
much
chance
to
rear
its
lovely
head
still
she
smiled
back
with
the
gentleness
that
he
found
disturbing
when
he
noticed
it
shoo
she
said
your
guests
will
be
here
any
minute
you
to
meet
them
in
jimmy
office
blades
ducked
into
the
tiny
washroom
he
was
any
star
himself
he
decided
as
he
smeared
cream
over
his
face
big
homely
not
something
you
be
scared
to
meet
in
a
dark
alley
either
he
added
smugly
in
fact
there
had
been
an
alley
in
aresopolis
things
were
expected
to
be
going
so
smoothly
by
the
time
they
approached
conjunction
with
mars
that
he
could
run
over
to
that
sinful
ginful
city
for
a
vacation
long
overdue
whooee
he
wiped
off
his
whiskers
shucked
the
zipskin
and
climbed
into
the
white
pants
and
blue
tunic
that
must
serve
as
formal
garb
emerging
he
stopped
again
at
avis
desk
any
message
from
the
he
asked
no
the
girl
said
but
she
ought
to
be
here
in
another
two
watches
right
on
sked
you
worry
too
much
mike
somebody
has
to
and
i
have
got
jimmy
buddhist
attitude
you
should
cultivate
it
she
grew
curious
the
brown
eyes
lingered
on
him
worry
contagious
you
make
me
fret
about
you
nothing
going
to
give
me
an
ulcer
but
the
shortage
of
booze
on
this
rock
uh
if
bill
mbolo
should
call
about
those
catalysts
while
gone
tell
him
he
ran
off
a
string
of
instructions
and
headed
for
the
door
chung
hangout
was
halfway
around
the
asteroid
so
that
one
chief
or
the
other
could
be
a
little
nearer
the
scene
of
any
emergency
not
that
they
spent
much
time
at
their
desks
shorthanded
and
undermechanized
they
were
forever
having
to
help
out
in
the
actual
construction
once
in
a
while
blades
found
himself
harking
wistfully
back
to
his
days
as
an
engineer
with
solar
metals
good
pay
interesting
if
hazardous
work
on
flying
mountains
where
men
had
never
trod
before
and
no
further
responsibilities
but
most
asterites
had
the
dream
of
becoming
their
own
bosses
when
he
arrived
the
officers
were
already
there
a
score
of
correct
young
men
in
white
dress
uniforms
short
squat
and
placid
looking
jimmy
chung
stood
making
polite
conversation
ah
there
he
said
lieutenant
ziska
and
gentlemen
my
partner
michael
blades
mike
may
i
present
blades
attention
stopped
at
lieutenant
ziska
he
heard
vaguely
that
she
was
the
head
quartermaster
officer
but
mainly
she
was
tall
and
blond
and
with
a
bewitching
dimple
when
she
smiled
and
filled
her
gown
the
way
a
cellini
venus
doubtless
filled
its
casting
mold
very
pleased
to
meet
you
blades
she
said
as
if
she
meant
it
maybe
she
did
he
gulped
for
air
and
commander
leibknecht
chung
said
across
several
commander
leibknecht
oh
sure
blades
dropped
lieutenant
ziska
hand
in
reluctant
haste
hardjado
leibfraumilch
somehow
the
introductions
were
gotten
through
i
sorry
we
have
to
be
so
inhospitable
chung
said
but
you
see
how
crowded
we
are
about
all
we
can
do
is
show
you
around
if
you
interested
of
course
you
interested
said
blades
to
lieutenant
ziska
show
you
some
gimmicks
i
thought
up
myself
chung
scowled
at
him
we
best
divide
the
party
and
proceed
along
alternate
routes
he
said
we
meet
again
in
the
mess
for
coffee
lieutenant
ziska
would
you
like
to
come
with
me
certainly
blades
said
chung
glance
became
downright
murderous
i
thought
he
began
sure
blades
nodded
vigorously
you
being
the
senior
partner
you
take
the
highest
ranking
of
these
gentlemen
and
i
be
in
scotland
before
you
let
get
started
may
i
he
offered
the
quartermistress
his
arm
she
smiled
and
took
it
he
supposed
that
eight
or
ten
of
her
fellows
trailed
them
the
first
disturbing
note
was
sounded
on
the
verandah
illustration
they
had
glanced
at
the
cavelike
dormitories
where
most
of
the
personnel
lived
at
the
recreation
dome
topside
which
made
the
life
tolerable
at
kitchen
sick
bay
and
the
other
service
facilities
at
the
hydroponic
tanks
and
yeast
vats
which
supplied
much
of
the
station
food
at
the
tiny
cabins
scooped
out
for
the
top
engineers
and
the
married
couples
before
leaving
this
end
of
the
asteroid
blades
took
his
group
to
the
verandah
it
was
a
clear
dome
jutting
from
the
surface
softly
lighted
furnished
as
a
primitive
lounge
open
to
a
view
of
half
the
sky
murmured
ellen
ziska
unconsciously
she
moved
closer
to
blades
young
lieutenant
commander
gilbertson
gave
her
a
somewhat
jaundiced
look
you
seen
deep
space
often
enough
before
he
said
through
a
port
or
a
helmet
her
eyes
glimmered
enormous
in
the
dusk
never
like
this
the
stars
crowded
close
in
their
wintry
myriads
the
galactic
belt
glistened
diamond
against
infinite
darkness
vision
toppled
endlessly
outward
toward
the
far
mysterious
shimmer
of
the
andromeda
nebula
silence
was
not
a
mere
absence
of
noise
but
a
majestic
presence
the
seething
of
suns
what
about
the
observation
terrace
at
leyburg
gilbertson
challenged
that
was
different
ellen
ziska
said
everything
was
safe
and
civilized
this
is
like
being
on
the
edge
of
creation
blades
could
see
why
goddard
house
had
so
long
resisted
the
inclusion
of
female
officers
on
ships
of
the
line
despite
political
pressure
at
home
and
the
russian
example
abroad
he
was
glad
they
finally
given
in
now
if
only
he
could
build
himself
up
as
a
dashing
romantic
type
but
how
long
would
the
stay
her
stopover
seemed
quite
extended
already
for
a
casual
visit
in
the
course
of
a
routine
patrol
cruise
he
have
to
work
fast
yes
we
are
pretty
isolated
he
said
the
jupiter
ships
just
unload
their
balloons
pick
up
the
empties
and
head
right
back
for
another
cargo
i
do
understand
how
you
can
found
an
industry
here
when
your
raw
materials
only
arrive
at
conjunction
ellen
said
things
will
be
different
once
we
in
full
operation
blades
assured
her
then
we
be
doing
enough
business
to
pay
for
a
steady
input
transshipped
from
whatever
depot
is
nearest
jupiter
at
any
given
time
you
actually
built
this
simply
to
process
gas
gilbertson
interposed
blades
did
know
whether
he
was
being
sarcastic
or
asking
a
genuine
question
it
was
astonishing
how
ignorant
earthsiders
even
earthsiders
often
were
about
such
matters
jovian
gas
is
rich
stuff
he
explained
chiefly
hydrogen
and
helium
of
course
but
the
scoopships
separate
out
most
of
that
during
a
pickup
the
rest
is
ammonia
water
methane
a
dozen
important
organics
including
some
of
the
damn
doggonedest
metallic
complexes
you
ever
heard
of
we
need
them
as
the
basis
of
a
chemosynthetic
industry
which
we
need
for
survival
which
we
need
if
we
to
get
the
minerals
that
were
the
reason
for
colonizing
the
belt
in
the
first
place
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
sky
when
we
really
get
going
we
attract
settlement
this
asteroid
has
companions
waiting
for
people
to
come
and
mine
them
homeships
and
orbital
stations
will
be
built
in
ten
years
there
be
quite
a
little
city
clustered
around
the
sword
it
happened
before
nodded
commander
warburton
of
gunnery
control
it
going
to
happen
a
lot
oftener
blades
said
enthusiastically
the
belt
going
to
grow
he
aimed
his
words
at
ellen
this
is
the
real
frontier
the
planets
will
never
amount
to
much
it
actually
harder
to
maintain
conditions
on
so
big
a
mass
with
a
useless
atmosphere
around
you
than
on
a
lump
in
space
like
this
and
the
gravity
wells
are
so
deep
even
given
nuclear
power
the
energy
cost
of
really
exploiting
a
planet
is
prohibitive
besides
which
the
choice
minerals
are
buried
under
kilometers
of
rock
on
a
metallic
asteroid
you
can
find
almost
everything
you
want
directly
under
your
feet
no
limit
to
what
you
can
do
but
your
own
energy
expenditure
gilbertson
objected
that
no
problem
as
if
on
cue
the
worldlet
spin
brought
the
sun
into
sight
tiny
but
intolerably
brilliant
it
flooded
the
dome
with
harsh
radiance
blades
lowered
the
blinds
on
that
side
he
pointed
in
the
opposite
direction
toward
several
sparks
of
equal
brightness
that
had
manifested
themselves
parabolic
mirrors
he
said
easy
to
make
you
spray
a
thin
metallic
coat
on
a
plastic
backing
they
in
orbit
around
us
each
with
a
small
geegee
unit
to
control
drift
and
keep
it
aimed
directly
at
the
sun
the
focused
radiation
charges
accumulators
which
we
then
collect
and
use
for
our
power
source
in
all
our
mobile
work
do
you
mean
you
have
any
nuclear
generator
asked
warburton
he
seemed
curiously
intent
about
it
blades
wondered
why
but
nodded
that
correct
we
do
want
one
too
dangerous
for
us
nor
is
it
necessary
even
at
this
distance
from
the
sun
and
allowing
for
assorted
inefficiencies
a
mirror
supplies
better
than
five
hundred
kilowatts
hours
a
day
year
after
year
absolutely
free
yes
warburton
lean
head
turned
slowly
about
to
rake
blades
with
a
look
of
calculation
i
understand
that
the
normal
power
system
in
stations
of
this
type
but
we
did
know
if
it
was
used
in
your
case
too
should
you
care
blades
thought
he
shoved
aside
his
faint
unease
and
urged
ellen
toward
the
dome
railing
maybe
we
can
spot
your
ship
lieutenant
uh
miss
ziska
here
a
telescope
let
me
see
her
orbit
ought
to
run
about
so
he
hunted
until
the
swam
into
the
viewfield
at
this
distance
the
spheroid
looked
like
a
tiny
crescent
moon
dully
painted
but
he
could
make
out
the
sinister
shapes
of
a
rifle
turret
and
a
couple
of
missile
launchers
have
a
look
he
invited
her
hair
tickled
his
nose
brushing
past
him
it
had
a
delightful
sunny
odor
how
small
she
seems
the
girl
said
with
the
same
note
of
wonder
as
before
and
how
huge
when
you
aboard
big
all
right
blades
knew
and
loaded
to
the
hatches
with
nuclear
hellfire
but
not
massive
a
civilian
spaceship
carried
meteor
plating
but
since
that
was
about
as
useful
as
wet
cardboard
against
modern
weapons
warcraft
sacrificed
it
for
the
sake
of
mobility
the
hull
was
thin
magnesium
the
outer
shell
periodically
renewed
as
cosmic
sand
eroded
it
i
not
surprised
we
orbited
instead
of
docking
ellen
remarked
we
have
butted
against
your
radar
and
bellied
into
your
control
tower
well
actually
no
said
blades
even
half
finished
our
dock
big
enough
to
accommodate
you
as
you
see
today
do
forget
we
anticipate
a
lot
of
traffic
in
the
future
i
puzzled
why
you
accept
our
invitation
to
use
it
doctrine
warburton
clipped
the
sun
came
past
the
blind
and
touched
the
officers
faces
with
incandescence
did
some
look
startled
one
or
two
open
their
mouths
as
if
to
protest
and
then
snap
them
shut
again
at
a
warning
look
spine
tingled
never
heard
of
any
such
doctrine
he
thought
of
all
when
a
north
american
ship
drops
in
on
a
north
american
is
er
is
there
some
international
crisis
brewing
he
inquired
why
no
ellen
straightened
from
the
telescope
i
say
relations
have
seldom
been
as
good
as
they
are
now
what
makes
you
ask
well
the
reason
your
captain
did
never
mind
warburton
said
we
better
continue
the
tour
if
you
please
blades
filed
his
misgivings
for
later
reference
he
might
have
fretted
immediately
but
ellen
ziska
presence
forbade
that
a
sort
of
pauli
exclusion
principle
one
ca
have
two
spins
simultaneously
can
one
he
gave
her
his
arm
again
let
go
on
to
central
control
he
proposed
that
right
behind
the
people
section
you
know
i
ca
get
over
it
she
told
him
softly
this
miracle
you
wrought
i
never
been
more
proud
of
being
human
is
this
your
first
long
space
trip
yes
i
was
stationed
at
port
colorado
before
the
new
administration
reshuffled
armed
service
assignments
they
did
how
come
i
do
know
well
that
is
during
the
election
campaign
the
social
justice
party
did
talk
a
lot
about
officers
who
were
too
hidebound
to
carry
out
modern
policies
effectively
but
it
sounded
rather
silly
to
me
warburton
compressed
his
lips
i
do
not
believe
it
is
proper
for
service
officers
to
discuss
political
issues
publicly
he
said
like
a
machine
gun
ellen
flushed
commander
blades
felt
a
helpless
anger
on
her
account
he
was
sure
why
what
was
she
to
him
he
probably
never
see
her
again
a
hell
of
an
attractive
target
to
be
sure
and
after
so
much
celibacy
he
was
highly
vulnerable
but
did
she
really
matter
he
turned
his
back
on
warburton
and
his
eyes
on
her
a
five
thousand
per
cent
improvement
and
diverted
her
from
her
embarrassment
by
asking
are
you
from
colorado
then
miss
ziska
oh
no
toronto
how
you
happen
to
join
the
navy
if
i
may
make
so
bold
gosh
that
hard
to
say
but
i
guess
mostly
i
felt
so
crowded
at
home
so
pigeonholed
the
world
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
neat
little
pigeonholes
same
here
i
was
also
a
square
pigeon
in
a
round
hole
she
laughed
luckily
he
added
space
is
too
big
for
compartments
her
agreement
lacked
vigor
the
navy
must
have
been
a
disappointment
to
her
but
she
could
very
well
say
so
in
front
of
her
shipmates
if
she
could
be
gotten
away
from
them
how
long
will
you
be
here
he
inquired
his
pulse
thuttered
we
have
been
told
she
said
some
work
must
be
done
on
the
missile
launchers
warburton
said
that
best
carried
out
here
where
extra
facilities
are
available
if
we
need
them
not
that
i
expect
we
will
he
paused
i
hope
we
interfere
with
your
own
operations
far
from
it
blades
beamed
at
ellen
or
more
accurately
this
kind
of
interference
i
do
mind
in
the
least
she
blushed
and
her
eyelids
fluttered
not
that
she
was
a
fluffhead
he
realized
but
to
avoid
incidents
navy
regulations
enforced
an
inhuman
correctness
between
personnel
of
opposite
sexes
after
weeks
in
the
black
meeting
a
man
who
could
pay
a
compliment
without
risking
must
be
like
a
shot
of
adrenalin
better
and
better
are
you
sure
warburton
persisted
for
instance
wo
we
be
in
the
way
when
the
next
ship
comes
from
jupiter
she
approach
the
opposite
end
of
the
asteroid
blades
said
wo
stay
long
either
how
long
one
watch
so
the
crew
can
relax
a
bit
among
those
of
us
who
off
duty
it
be
a
trifle
longer
if
we
did
happen
to
have
an
empty
bag
at
the
moment
but
never
very
long
even
running
under
thrust
the
whole
distance
jupe
a
good
ways
off
they
no
time
to
waste
when
is
the
next
ship
due
the
is
expected
in
the
second
watch
from
now
second
watch
i
see
warburton
stalked
on
with
a
brooding
expression
on
his
puritan
face
blades
might
have
speculated
about
that
but
someone
asked
him
why
the
station
depended
on
spin
for
weight
why
not
put
in
an
internal
field
generator
like
a
ship
blades
explained
patiently
that
an
emett
large
enough
to
produce
uniform
pull
through
a
volume
as
big
as
the
sword
was
rather
expensive
eventually
when
we
a
few
megabucks
ahead
of
the
game
do
you
really
expect
to
become
rich
ellen
asked
her
tone
was
awed
no
earthsider
had
that
chance
any
more
except
for
the
great
corporations
rich
we
ca
fail
to
i
tell
you
this
is
a
frontier
like
nothing
since
the
conquistadores
we
could
very
easily
have
been
wiped
out
in
the
first
couple
of
years
financially
or
physically
by
any
of
a
thousand
accidents
but
now
we
too
far
along
for
that
we
got
it
made
jimmy
and
i
what
will
you
do
with
your
wealth
live
like
an
sultan
blades
grinned
then
because
it
was
true
as
well
as
because
he
wanted
to
shine
in
her
eyes
mostly
though
we
go
on
to
new
things
there
so
much
that
needs
to
be
done
not
simply
more
asteroid
mines
we
need
farms
timber
parks
passenger
and
cargo
liners
every
sort
of
machine
i
like
to
try
getting
at
some
of
that
water
frozen
in
the
saturnian
system
altogether
i
see
no
end
to
the
jobs
it
no
good
our
depending
on
earth
for
anything
too
expensive
too
chancy
the
belt
has
to
be
made
completely
with
a
nice
rakeoff
for
sword
enterprises
gilbertson
scoffed
why
sure
are
we
entitled
to
some
return
yes
but
not
so
out
of
proportion
as
the
belt
companies
seem
to
expect
they
only
using
natural
resources
that
rightly
belong
to
the
people
and
the
accumulated
skills
and
wealth
of
an
entire
society
huh
the
people
did
do
anything
with
the
sword
jimmy
and
i
and
our
boys
did
no
society
was
around
here
grubbing
and
riding
out
gravel
storms
we
were
let
leave
politics
alone
warburton
snapped
but
it
was
mostly
ellen
look
of
distress
which
shut
blades
up
to
everybody
relief
they
reached
central
control
about
then
it
was
a
complex
of
domes
and
rooms
crammed
with
more
equipment
than
blades
could
put
a
name
to
computers
were
in
chung
line
not
his
he
was
able
to
answer
all
of
warburton
disconcertingly
sharp
questions
but
in
a
general
way
he
could
whirling
through
vacuum
with
a
load
of
frail
humans
and
intricate
artifacts
the
sword
must
be
at
once
machine
ecology
and
unified
organism
everything
had
to
mesh
a
failure
in
the
thermodynamic
balance
a
miscalculation
in
supply
inventory
a
few
mirrors
perturbed
out
of
proper
orbit
might
spell
ragnarok
the
chemical
plant
purifications
and
syntheses
were
already
a
network
too
large
for
the
human
mind
to
grasp
as
a
whole
and
it
was
still
growing
even
where
men
could
have
taken
charge
automation
was
cheaper
more
reliable
less
risky
of
lives
the
computer
system
housed
in
central
control
was
not
only
the
brain
but
the
nerves
and
heart
of
the
sword
entirely
cryotronic
eh
warburton
commented
that
seems
to
be
the
usual
practice
at
the
stations
why
the
least
expensive
type
for
us
blades
answered
there
no
problem
in
maintaining
liquid
helium
here
warburton
gaze
was
peculiarly
intense
cryotronic
systems
are
vulnerable
to
magnetic
and
radiation
disturbances
that
one
reason
we
do
have
a
nuclear
power
plant
this
far
from
the
sun
we
do
get
enough
emission
to
worry
about
the
asteroid
mass
screens
out
what
little
may
arrive
i
know
the
timm
system
is
used
on
ships
but
if
nothing
else
the
initial
cost
is
more
than
we
want
to
pay
what
timm
inquired
the
chaplain
thermally
integrated
ellen
said
crisply
essentially
ultraminiaturized
vacuum
tubes
running
off
thermionic
generators
they
immune
to
gamma
ray
and
magnetic
pulses
easily
shielded
against
particule
radiation
and
economical
of
power
she
grinned
do
tell
me
there
nothing
about
them
in
leviticus
padre
very
fine
for
a
ship
autopilot
blades
agreed
but
as
i
said
we
need
worry
about
rad
or
mag
units
here
we
do
mind
sprawling
a
bit
and
as
for
thermal
efficiency
we
want
to
waste
some
heat
it
goes
to
maintain
internal
temperature
in
other
words
efficiency
depends
on
what
you
need
to
effish
ellen
bantered
she
grew
grave
once
more
and
studied
him
for
a
while
before
she
mused
the
same
person
who
swung
a
pick
a
couple
of
years
ago
now
deals
with
something
as
marvelous
as
this
he
forgot
about
worrying
but
he
remembered
later
when
the
gig
had
left
and
chung
called
him
to
his
office
avis
came
too
by
request
as
she
entered
she
asked
why
you
were
visiting
your
folks
earthside
last
year
chung
said
nobody
else
in
the
station
has
been
back
as
recently
as
that
what
can
i
tell
you
i
not
sure
background
perhaps
the
feel
of
the
place
we
really
know
out
in
the
belt
what
going
on
there
the
beamcast
news
is
hardly
a
trickle
besides
you
have
more
common
sense
in
your
left
little
toe
than
that
big
mick
yonder
has
on
his
entire
copperplated
head
they
seated
themselves
in
the
cobwebby
chairs
around
desk
blades
took
out
his
pipe
and
filled
the
bowl
with
his
tobacco
ration
for
today
would
it
be
great
he
thought
dreamily
if
this
old
briar
turned
out
to
be
an
aladdin
lamp
and
the
smoke
condensed
into
a
blonde
wake
up
will
you
chung
barked
huh
blades
started
oh
sure
what
the
matter
you
look
like
a
fish
on
friday
maybe
with
reason
did
you
notice
anything
unusual
with
that
party
you
were
escorting
yes
indeed
what
about
one
hundred
centimeters
tall
yellow
hair
blue
eyes
and
some
of
the
smoothest
curves
i
ever
mike
stop
that
avis
sounded
appalled
this
is
serious
i
agree
she
be
leaving
in
a
few
more
watches
the
girl
bit
her
lip
you
too
old
for
that
mooncalf
rot
and
you
know
it
agreed
again
i
feel
more
like
a
bull
blades
made
pawing
motions
on
the
desktop
there
a
lady
present
chung
said
blades
saw
that
avis
had
gone
quite
pale
i
sorry
he
blurted
i
never
thought
i
mean
you
always
seemed
like
one
of
the
boys
she
finished
for
him
in
a
brittle
tone
sure
forget
it
what
the
problem
jimmy
chung
folded
his
hands
and
stared
at
them
i
ca
quite
define
that
he
answered
word
by
careful
word
perhaps
i
simply
gone
spacedizzy
but
when
we
called
on
admiral
hulse
and
later
when
he
called
on
us
did
you
get
the
impression
of
well
wariness
he
seem
to
be
watching
and
probing
every
minute
we
were
together
i
would
call
him
a
cheerful
sort
blades
nodded
stiff
as
molasses
on
pluto
but
i
suppose
supposed
he
just
naturally
that
way
chung
shook
his
head
it
was
a
normal
standoffishness
heard
me
reminisce
about
the
time
i
was
on
vesta
with
the
north
american
technical
representative
when
the
convention
was
negotiated
yes
i
heard
that
story
a
few
times
said
avis
dryly
remember
that
was
right
after
the
europa
incident
we
come
close
to
a
space
war
undeclared
but
it
would
have
been
nasty
we
were
still
close
every
delegate
went
to
that
conference
cocked
and
primed
hulse
had
the
same
manner
a
silence
fell
blades
said
at
length
well
come
to
think
of
it
he
did
ask
some
rather
odd
questions
he
seemed
to
twist
the
conversation
now
and
then
so
he
could
find
things
out
like
our
exact
layout
emergency
doctrine
and
so
forth
it
did
strike
me
as
significant
though
nor
me
chung
admitted
taken
in
isolation
it
meant
nothing
but
these
visitors
today
sure
most
of
them
obviously
did
suspect
anything
untoward
but
that
liebknecht
now
why
was
he
so
interested
in
central
control
nothing
new
or
secret
there
yet
he
kept
asking
for
details
like
the
shielding
factor
of
the
walls
so
did
commander
warburton
blades
remembered
also
he
wanted
to
know
exactly
when
the
is
due
how
long
she
stay
yes
whether
we
have
any
radio
linkage
with
the
outside
like
to
ceres
or
even
the
nearest
commission
base
did
you
tell
him
that
we
do
avis
asked
sharply
yes
should
i
have
it
scarcely
makes
any
difference
chung
said
in
a
resigned
voice
as
thoroughly
as
they
went
over
the
ground
they
have
seen
what
we
do
and
do
not
have
installed
so
far
he
leaned
forward
why
are
they
hanging
around
he
asked
i
was
handed
some
story
about
overhauling
the
missile
system
me
too
blades
said
but
you
do
consider
a
job
complete
till
it
been
tested
and
you
do
fire
a
test
shot
even
a
dummy
this
close
to
a
station
besides
what
could
have
gone
wrong
i
ca
see
a
ship
departing
earth
orbit
for
a
long
cruise
without
everything
being
in
order
and
they
did
mention
any
meteorites
any
kind
of
trouble
en
route
furthermore
why
do
the
work
here
the
navy
yard
at
ceres
we
spare
them
any
decent
amount
of
materials
or
tools
or
help
blades
frowned
his
own
doubts
shouldered
to
the
fore
which
was
doubly
unpleasant
after
he
been
considering
ellen
ziska
they
tell
me
the
international
situation
at
home
is
he
offered
avis
nodded
what
newsfaxes
we
get
in
the
mail
indicate
as
much
she
said
so
why
this
after
a
moment
in
a
changed
voice
jimmy
you
begin
to
scare
me
a
little
i
scare
myself
chung
said
every
morning
when
you
debeard
blades
said
but
his
heart
in
it
he
shook
himself
and
protested
damnation
they
our
own
countrymen
we
engaged
in
a
lawful
business
why
should
they
do
anything
to
us
maybe
avis
can
throw
some
light
on
that
chung
suggested
the
girl
twisted
her
fingers
together
not
me
she
said
i
no
politician
but
you
were
home
not
so
long
ago
you
talked
with
people
read
the
news
watched
the
ca
you
at
least
give
an
impression
well
of
course
the
preliminary
guns
of
the
election
campaign
were
already
being
fired
the
social
justice
party
was
talking
a
lot
about
oh
it
seemed
so
ridiculous
that
i
did
pay
much
attention
they
talked
about
how
the
government
had
been
pouring
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
into
space
while
overpopulation
produced
crying
needs
in
america
back
yard
chung
said
we
know
that
much
even
in
the
belt
we
know
the
appropriations
are
due
to
be
cut
now
the
essjays
are
in
so
what
we
do
need
a
subsidy
any
longer
blades
remarked
it
help
a
lot
but
we
can
get
along
without
if
we
have
to
and
personally
i
prefer
that
less
government
money
means
less
government
control
sure
avis
said
there
was
more
than
that
involved
however
the
essjays
were
complaining
about
the
small
return
on
the
investment
not
enough
minerals
coming
back
to
earth
well
for
jupiter
sake
blades
exclaimed
what
do
they
expect
we
have
to
build
up
our
capabilities
first
they
even
said
some
of
them
that
enough
reward
never
would
be
gotten
that
under
existing
financial
policies
the
belt
would
go
in
for
its
own
expansion
use
nearly
everything
it
produced
for
itself
and
export
only
a
trickle
to
america
i
had
to
explain
to
several
of
my
parents
friends
that
i
was
really
a
socially
irresponsible
capitalist
is
that
all
the
information
you
have
chung
asked
when
she
fell
silent
i
i
suppose
so
everything
was
so
vague
no
dramatic
events
more
of
an
atmosphere
than
a
concrete
thing
still
you
confirm
my
own
impression
chung
said
blades
jerked
his
undisciplined
imagination
back
from
the
idea
of
a
thing
with
bug
eyes
and
tentacles
cast
in
reinforced
concrete
and
listened
as
his
partner
summed
up
the
popular
feeling
at
home
has
turned
against
private
enterprise
you
can
hardly
call
a
corporate
monster
like
systemic
developments
a
private
enterprise
the
new
president
and
congress
share
that
mood
we
can
expect
to
see
it
manifested
in
changed
laws
and
regulations
but
what
has
this
got
to
do
with
a
battleship
parked
a
couple
of
hundred
kilometers
from
us
if
the
government
does
want
the
asterites
to
develop
much
further
blades
bit
hard
on
his
pipestem
they
must
know
we
have
a
caviar
mine
here
we
be
the
only
city
in
this
entire
sector
but
we
still
a
baby
avis
said
we
wo
be
important
for
years
to
come
who
have
it
in
for
a
baby
besides
we
americans
too
chung
said
if
that
were
a
foreign
ship
the
story
might
be
different
wait
a
minute
could
they
be
thinking
of
establishing
a
new
base
here
the
convention
would
allow
said
blades
treaties
can
always
be
renegotiated
or
even
denounced
but
first
you
have
to
investigate
quietly
find
out
if
it
worth
your
while
hoo
hah
what
lovely
money
that
mean
and
lovely
bureaucrats
crawling
out
of
every
file
cabinet
chung
said
grimly
no
thank
you
we
fight
any
such
attempt
to
the
last
lawyer
we
got
a
good
basis
too
in
our
charter
if
the
suit
is
tried
on
ceres
as
i
believe
it
has
to
be
we
get
a
sympathetic
court
as
well
unless
they
ring
in
an
earthside
judge
avis
warned
yeah
that
possible
also
they
could
spring
proceedings
on
us
without
notice
we
got
to
find
out
in
advance
so
we
can
prepare
any
chance
of
pumping
some
of
those
officers
not
avis
said
the
few
who
be
in
the
know
are
safely
back
on
shipboard
we
could
invite
here
individually
said
blades
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
already
have
a
date
with
lieutenant
ziska
what
avis
mouth
fell
open
yep
blades
said
complacently
end
of
the
next
watch
so
she
can
observe
the
arriving
i
to
fetch
her
on
a
scooter
he
blew
a
fat
smoke
ring
look
jimmy
can
you
keep
everybody
off
the
porch
for
a
while
then
starlight
privacy
soft
music
on
the
piccolo
who
knows
what
i
might
find
out
you
wo
get
anything
from
avis
spat
no
secrets
or
or
anything
still
i
look
forward
to
making
the
attempt
pal
pass
the
word
i
do
as
much
for
you
sometime
times
like
that
never
seem
to
come
for
me
chung
groaned
oh
let
him
play
around
with
his
suicide
blonde
avis
said
furiously
we
others
have
work
to
do
i
i
tell
you
what
jimmy
let
not
eat
in
the
mess
tonight
i
draw
our
rations
and
fix
us
something
special
in
your
cabin
illustration
a
scooter
was
not
exactly
the
ideal
steed
for
a
knight
to
convey
his
lady
it
amounted
to
little
more
than
three
saddles
and
a
locker
set
atop
an
gyrogravitic
engine
sufficient
to
lift
you
off
an
asteroid
and
run
at
low
acceleration
there
were
no
navigating
instruments
you
locked
the
autopilot
sensors
onto
your
target
object
and
it
took
you
there
avoiding
any
bits
of
debris
which
might
pass
near
but
you
must
watch
the
distance
indicator
and
press
the
deceleration
switch
in
time
if
the
was
turned
off
free
maneuver
became
possible
but
that
was
a
dangerous
thing
to
try
before
you
were
almost
on
top
of
your
destination
stereoscopic
vision
fails
beyond
six
or
seven
meters
and
the
human
organism
is
equipped
to
gauge
cosmic
momenta
nevertheless
ellen
was
enchanted
this
is
like
a
dream
her
voice
murmured
in
blades
earplug
the
whole
universe
on
every
side
of
us
i
could
almost
reach
out
and
pluck
those
stars
you
must
have
trained
in
powered
spacesuits
at
the
academy
he
said
for
lack
of
a
more
poetic
rejoinder
yes
but
that
not
the
same
we
had
to
stay
near
luna
night
side
to
be
safe
from
solar
particles
and
it
bit
a
great
chunk
out
of
the
sky
and
then
everything
was
so
regulated
disciplined
we
did
what
we
were
ordered
to
do
and
that
was
that
here
i
feel
free
you
imagine
how
free
hastily
do
you
use
this
machine
often
well
yes
we
have
about
twenty
scooters
at
the
station
they
the
most
convenient
way
of
flitting
with
a
load
out
to
the
mirrors
to
change
accumulators
for
instance
or
across
to
one
of
the
companion
rocks
where
we
digging
some
ores
that
the
sword
does
have
that
kind
of
work
blades
would
frankly
rather
have
had
her
behind
him
on
a
motorskimmer
hanging
on
as
they
careened
through
a
springtime
countryside
he
was
glad
when
they
reached
the
main
forward
air
lock
and
debarked
he
was
still
gladder
when
the
suits
were
off
lieutenant
ziska
in
dress
uniform
was
stunning
but
ellen
in
civvies
a
fluffy
blouse
and
slacks
was
a
hydrogen
blast
he
wanted
to
roll
over
and
pant
but
settled
for
saying
welcome
back
and
holding
her
hand
rather
longer
than
necessary
with
a
shy
smile
she
gave
him
a
package
i
drew
this
before
leaving
she
said
i
thought
well
your
life
is
so
austere
a
demi
of
sandeman
he
said
reverently
i
wo
tell
you
you
should
have
but
i
will
tell
you
you
a
sweet
girl
no
really
she
flushed
after
we
put
you
to
so
much
trouble
let
go
crack
this
he
said
the
has
called
in
but
she
wo
be
visible
for
a
while
yet
they
made
their
way
to
the
verandah
picking
up
a
couple
of
glasses
enroute
bless
his
envious
heart
jimmy
had
warned
the
other
boys
off
as
requested
hope
avis
cooks
him
a
cordon
bleu
blades
thought
kid
avis
if
she
quit
trying
to
what
mother
me
he
forgot
about
her
with
ellen
to
seat
by
the
rail
the
milky
way
turned
her
hair
frosty
and
glowed
in
her
eyes
blades
poured
the
port
with
much
ceremony
and
raised
his
glass
here
to
your
frequent
return
he
said
her
pleasure
dwindled
a
bit
i
do
know
if
i
should
drink
to
that
we
are
likely
to
be
back
ever
drink
anyway
gling
glang
gloria
the
rims
tinkled
together
after
all
said
blades
this
is
the
whole
universe
we
both
be
getting
around
see
you
on
luna
maybe
he
wondered
if
he
was
pushing
matters
too
hard
she
did
look
at
ease
oh
well
he
said
if
nothing
else
this
has
been
a
grand
break
in
the
monotony
for
us
i
do
wish
the
navy
ill
but
if
trouble
had
to
develop
i
thankful
it
developed
here
yes
how
the
repair
work
progressing
slowly
i
hope
i
do
know
you
should
have
some
idea
being
in
qm
no
supplies
have
been
drawn
blades
stiffened
what
the
matter
ellen
sounded
alarmed
huh
fine
conspirator
i
make
if
she
can
see
my
emotions
on
me
in
neon
capitals
nothing
nothing
it
just
seemed
a
little
strange
you
know
not
taking
any
replacement
units
i
understand
the
work
is
only
a
matter
of
making
certain
adjustments
then
they
should
finished
a
lot
quicker
should
they
please
she
said
unhappily
let
not
talk
about
it
i
mean
there
are
such
things
as
security
regulations
blades
gave
up
on
that
tack
but
chung
idea
might
be
worth
probing
a
little
sure
he
said
i
sorry
i
did
mean
to
pry
he
took
another
sip
as
he
hunted
for
suitable
words
a
beautiful
girl
a
golden
wine
and
vice
versa
why
could
he
simply
relax
and
enjoy
himself
did
he
have
to
go
fretting
about
what
was
probably
a
perfectly
harmless
conundrum
yes
however
recreation
might
still
combine
with
business
permit
me
to
daydream
he
said
leaning
close
to
her
the
going
to
establish
a
new
base
here
and
the
will
be
assigned
to
it
daydream
indeed
she
laughed
relieved
to
get
back
to
a
mere
flirtation
ever
hear
about
the
convention
of
vesta
treaties
can
be
renegotiated
blades
plagiarized
what
do
we
need
an
extra
base
for
especially
since
the
government
plans
to
spend
such
large
sums
on
social
welfare
they
certainly
want
to
start
an
arms
race
besides
blades
nodded
notion
did
seem
pretty
he
thought
with
a
slight
chill
now
i
guess
it
completely
mostly
to
keep
the
conversation
going
he
shrugged
and
said
my
partner
and
me
too
aside
from
the
privilege
of
your
company
would
have
wanted
it
anyhow
not
that
we
unpatriotic
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
potential
bases
and
we
rather
keep
government
agencies
out
of
here
can
you
these
days
pretty
much
we
under
a
new
type
of
charter
as
a
private
partnership
the
first
such
charter
in
the
belt
as
far
as
i
know
though
there
be
more
in
the
future
the
bank
of
ceres
financed
us
we
have
taken
a
nickel
of
federal
money
is
that
possible
just
barely
i
no
economist
but
i
can
see
how
it
works
money
represents
goods
and
labor
hitherto
those
have
been
in
mighty
short
supply
out
here
government
subsidies
made
up
the
difference
enabling
us
to
buy
from
earth
but
now
the
asterites
have
built
up
enough
population
and
industry
that
they
have
some
capital
surplus
of
their
own
to
invest
in
projects
like
this
even
so
frankly
i
surprised
that
two
men
by
themselves
could
get
such
a
loan
it
must
be
huge
would
the
bank
rather
have
lent
the
money
to
some
corporation
to
tell
the
truth
we
have
friends
who
pulled
wires
for
us
also
it
was
done
partly
on
ideological
grounds
a
lot
of
asterites
would
like
to
see
more
strictly
enterprises
not
committed
to
anyone
on
earth
that
the
only
way
we
can
grow
otherwise
our
profits
our
net
production
that
is
will
continue
to
be
siphoned
off
for
the
mother
country
benefit
well
ellen
said
with
some
indignation
that
was
the
whole
reason
for
planting
asteroid
colonies
you
ca
expect
us
to
set
you
up
in
business
at
enormous
cost
to
ourselves
things
we
might
have
done
at
home
and
get
nothing
but
in
return
never
fear
we
repay
you
with
interest
blades
said
but
whatever
we
make
from
our
own
work
over
and
above
that
ought
to
stay
here
with
us
she
grew
angrier
your
kind
of
attitude
is
what
provoked
the
voters
to
elect
social
justice
candidates
nice
name
that
mused
blades
who
can
be
against
social
justice
but
you
know
i
think
i
go
into
politics
myself
i
organize
the
north
american
motherhood
party
you
would
be
so
flippant
if
you
go
see
how
people
have
to
live
back
there
as
bad
as
here
nonsense
you
know
that
is
true
but
bad
enough
and
you
going
to
stick
in
these
conditions
only
a
few
hours
ago
you
were
bragging
about
the
millions
you
intend
to
make
millions
millions
if
my
strength
holds
out
leered
blades
thinking
of
the
alley
in
aresopolis
but
he
decided
that
that
was
then
and
ellen
was
now
and
what
had
started
as
a
promising
little
party
was
turning
into
a
dismal
argument
about
politics
let
not
fight
he
said
we
got
different
orientations
and
only
make
each
other
mad
let
discuss
our
next
bottle
instead
at
the
coq
in
paris
shall
we
say
or
morraine
in
new
york
she
calmed
down
but
her
look
remained
troubled
you
right
we
are
different
she
said
low
isolated
living
and
working
under
conditions
we
can
hardly
imagine
on
earth
and
you
ca
really
imagine
our
problems
yes
you
becoming
another
people
i
hope
it
will
never
go
so
far
that
no
i
do
want
to
think
about
it
she
drained
her
glass
and
held
it
out
for
a
refill
smiling
very
well
sir
when
do
you
next
plan
to
be
in
paris
an
exceedingly
enjoyable
while
later
the
time
came
to
go
watch
the
maneuver
in
in
fact
it
had
somehow
gotten
past
that
time
and
they
were
late
but
they
did
hurry
their
walk
aft
blades
took
ellen
hand
and
she
raised
no
objection
schoolboyish
no
doubt
however
he
had
reached
the
reluctant
conclusion
that
for
all
his
dishonorable
intentions
this
affair
was
likely
to
go
beyond
the
schoolboy
stage
not
that
he
would
keep
trying
as
they
glided
through
the
refining
and
synthesizing
section
which
filled
the
broad
half
of
the
asteroid
the
noise
of
pumps
and
regulators
rose
until
it
throbbed
in
their
bones
ellen
gestured
at
one
of
the
pipes
which
crossed
the
corridor
overhead
do
you
really
handle
that
big
a
volume
at
a
time
she
asked
above
the
racket
no
he
said
did
i
explain
before
the
pipe
thick
because
so
heavily
armored
i
glad
you
do
use
that
dreadful
word
but
why
the
armor
high
pressure
partly
also
there
an
inertrans
lining
jupiter
gas
is
hellishly
reactive
at
room
temperature
the
metallic
complexes
especially
but
think
what
a
witch
brew
the
stuff
is
in
every
respect
once
been
refined
of
course
we
have
less
trouble
that
particular
pipe
is
carrying
it
raw
they
left
the
noise
behind
and
passed
on
to
the
approach
control
dome
at
the
receptor
end
the
two
men
on
duty
glanced
up
and
immediately
went
back
to
their
instruments
radio
voices
were
staccato
in
the
air
blades
led
ellen
to
an
observation
port
she
drew
a
sharp
breath
outside
the
broken
ground
fell
away
to
space
and
the
stars
the
ovoid
that
was
the
ship
hung
against
them
lit
by
the
hidden
sun
a
giant
even
at
her
distance
but
dwarfed
by
the
balloon
she
towed
as
that
bubble
tried
ponderously
to
rotate
rainbow
gleams
ran
across
it
hiding
and
then
revealing
the
constellations
here
on
the
asteroid
axis
there
was
no
weight
and
one
moved
with
underwater
smoothness
as
if
disembodied
oh
a
fairy
tale
ellen
sighed
four
sparks
flashed
out
of
the
boat
blisters
along
the
ship
hull
scoopships
blades
told
her
they
haul
the
cargo
in
being
so
much
more
maneuverable
actually
though
the
mother
vessel
is
going
to
park
her
load
in
orbit
while
those
boys
bring
in
another
one
see
there
it
comes
into
sight
we
still
have
got
the
capacity
to
keep
up
with
our
deliveries
how
many
are
there
scoopships
that
is
twenty
but
you
do
need
more
than
four
for
this
job
they
got
terrific
power
have
to
if
they
to
dive
from
orbit
down
into
the
jovian
atmosphere
ram
themselves
full
of
gas
and
come
back
there
they
go
the
was

the
great
sphere
she
had
hauled
from
jupiter
into
a
stable
path
computed
by
central

meanwhile
the
scoopships
small
only
by
comparison
with
her
locked
onto
the
other

as
it
drifted
close
energy
poured
into
their
drive

spiraling
downward
transparent

and
four
laboring
spacecraft
vanished
behind
the
horizon
the
completed
her
own
task
disengaged
her
towbars
and
dropped
from
view
headed
for
the
dock
the
second
balloon
rose
again
like
a
huge
glass
moon
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
sword
still
it
grew
in
ellen
eyes
kilometer
by
kilometer
of
approach
so
much
mass
was
easily
handled
but
the
braking
curve
looked
disdainfully
smooth
presently
she
could
make
out
the
scoopships
in
detail
elongated
teardrops
with
the
intake
gates
yawning
in
the
blunt
forward
end
cockpit
canopies
raised
very
slightly
above
instructions
rattled
from
the
men
in
the

the
balloon
veered
clumsily
toward
the
one
free
receptor
a
derricklike
structure
released
one
end
of
a
cable
which
streamed
skyward
things
that
ellen
could
quite
follow
in
this
tricky
light
were
done
by
the
four
tugs
mechanisms
of
their
own
extended
to
make
their
tow
fast
to
the
cable
they
did
not
cast
loose
at
once
but
continued
to
drag
a
little
easing
the
impact
of
centrifugal
force
nonetheless
a
slight
shudder
went
through
the
dome
as
slack
was
taken
up
then
the
job
was
over
the
scoopships
let
go
and
flitted
off
to
join
their
mother
vessel
the
balloon
was
winched
inward
spacesuited
men
moved
close
preparing
to
couple
valves
together
and
eventually
blades
said
into
the
abrupt
quietness
that
cargo
will
become
food
fabric
vitryl
plastiboard
reagents
fuels
a
hundred
different
things
that
what
we
here
for
i
never
seen
anything
so
wonderful
ellen
said
raptly
he
laid
an
arm
around
her
waist
the
intercom
chose
that
precise
moment
to
blare

the

begun
to
howl
rear

barclay
hulse
had
come
in

he
stood
as
if
on
parade
towering
over

the
asterite
was
red
with
fury
avis
page
crouched
in
a
corner
her
eyes
terrified
blades
barreled
through
the
doorway
and
stopped
hardly
short
of
a
collision
what
the
matter
he
puffed
plenty
chung
snarled
these
incredible
oafs
his
voice
broke
he
gets
mad
it
means
something
hulse
nailed
blades
with
a
glance
good
day
sir
he
clipped
i
have
had
to
report
a
regrettable
accident
which
will
require
you
to
evacuate
the
station
temporarily
i
hope
huh
as
i
told
chung
and
miss
page
a
nuclear
missile
has
escaped
us
if
it
explodes
the
radiation
will
be
lethal
even
in
the
heart
of
the
asteroid
what
what
blades
could
only
gobble
at
him
fortunately
the
is
here
she
can
take
your
whole
complement
aboard
and
move
to
a
safe
distance
while
we
search
for
the
object
how
the
hulse
allowed
himself
a
look
of
exasperation
evidently
i
have
to
repeat
myself
to
you
very
well
you
know
we
have
had
to
make
some
adjustments
on
our
launchers
what
you
did
not
know
was
the
reason
under
the
circumstances
i
think
it
permissible
to
tell
you
that
several
of
them
have
a
new
and
secret
experimental
control
system
one
of
our
missions
on
this
cruise
was
to
carry
out
field
tests
well
it
turned
out
that
the
system
is
still
full
of
ah
bugs
gunnery
command
has
had
endless
trouble
with
it
has
had
to
keep
tinkering
the
whole
way
from
earth
half
an
hour
ago
while
commander
warburton
was
completing
a
reassembly
lower
ranks
are
allowed
in
the
test
turrets
something
happened
i
ca
tell
you
my
guess
as
to
what
but
if
you
want
to
imagine
that
a
relay
got
stuck
that
will
do
for
practical
purposes
a
missile
was
released
under
power
not
a
dummy
the
real
thing
and
release
automatically
arms
the
war
head
the
news
was
like
a
hammerblow
blades
spoke
an
obscenity
sweat
sprang
forth
under
his
arms
and
trickled
down
his
ribs
no
such
thing
was
expected
hulse
went
on
it
an
utter
disaster
and
the
designers
of
the
system
are
likely
to
get
any
more
contracts
but
as
matters
were
no
radar
fix
was
gotten
on
it
and
it
was
soon
too
far
away
for
gyrogravitic
pulse
detection
the
thrust
vector
is
unknown
it
could
be
almost
anywhere
now
well
naval
missiles
are
programmed
to
reverse
acceleration
if
they
have
made
a
target
within
a
given
time
this
one
should
be
back
in
less
than
six
hours
if
it
first
detects
our
ship
everything
is
all
right
it
has
optical
recognition
circuits
that
identify
any
north
american
warcraft
by
type
disarm
the
war
head
and
steer
it
home
but
if
it
first
comes
within
fifty
kilometers
of
some
other
mass
like
this
asteroid
or
one
of
the
companion
rocks
it
will
detonate
we
make
every
effort
to
intercept
but
space
is
big
you
have
to
take
your
people
to
a
safe
distance
they
can
come
back
even
after
a
blast
of
course
there
no
concussion
in
vacuum
and
the
fireball
wo
reach
here
it
principally
an
weapon
but
you
must
not
be
within
the
lethal
radius
of
radiation
the
hell
we
can
come
back

your
pardon

we

many

of

every

the

most
sincere

i

the

indemnify
you

though
you
can
do
nothing
but
evacuate
and
hope
we
will
be
able
to
intercept
the

blades
knotted
his
fists
a
sudden
comprehension
rushed
up
in
him
and
he
bellowed
there
is
going
to
be
an
interception
this
was
an
accident
hulse
backed
a
step
and
drew
himself
even
straighter
do
get
overwrought
he
advised
you
bloated
how
stupid
do
you
think
we
are
as
stupid
as
your
essjay
bosses
by
heaven
staying
then
see
if
you
have
the
nerve
to
murder
a
hundred
people
mike
mike
avis
caught
his
arm
hulse
turned
to

i
overlook
that
unseemly
outburst
he
said
but
in
light
of
my
responsibilities
and
under
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
i
am
hereby
putting
this
asteroid
under
martial
law
you
will
have
all
personnel
aboard
the
and
at
a
minimum
distance
of
a
thousand
kilometers
within
four
hours
of
this

or
be
subject
to
arrest
and
trial
now
i
have
to
get
back
and
commence
operations
the
will
maintain
radio
contact
with

good
day
he
bowed
curtly
spun
on
his
heel
and
clacked
from
the
room
blades
started
to
charge
after
him
chung
caught
his
free
arm
together
he
and
avis
dragged
him
to
a
stop
he
stood
cursing
the
air
ultraviolet
until
ellen
entered
i
could
keep
up
with
you
she
panted
what
happened
mike
the
strength
drained
from

he
slumped
into
a
chair
and
covered
his
face
chung
explained
in
a
few
harsh
words
ellen
gasped
she
went
to
blades
and
laid
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
my
poor
mike
after
a
moment
she
looked
at
the
others
i
should
report
back
of
course
she
said
but
i
wo
be
able
to
before
the
ship
accelerates
so
i
have
to
stay
with
you
till
afterward
miss
page
we
left
about
half
a
bottle
of
wine
on
the
verandah
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
you
went
and
got
it
avis
bridled
and
why
not
you
this
is
no
time
for
personalities
chung
said
go
on
avis
you
can
be
thinking
what
records
and
other
paper
we
should
take
while
on
your

i
got
to
organize
the
evacuation
as
for
miss
ziska
well
mike
needs
somebody
to
pull
him
out

her
avis
wailed

flipped
his

captain

he
ordered
hello
adam
about

you
better
clear
out
along
with
the
women
and
any
men
who
do
want
to
stay
he
said
but
i
think
most
of
them
will
take
the
chance
they
on
a
scheme
they
stand
to
lose
too
much

the

what
do
you
mean
it
a
gamble
but
i
do
believe
hulse
sealed
orders
extend
to
murder
if
enough
of
us
stay
put
he
have
to
catch
that
thing
he
jolly
well
knows
its
exact
trajectory
you
forget
we
under
martial
law
chung
said
aside
to
him
if
we
do
go
freely
he
land
some
pp
and
march
us
off
at
gunpoint
there
is
any
choice
we
had
the
course
i
do
understand
ellen
said
shakily
chung
went
back
to
his
intercom
blades
fumbled
out
his
pipe
and
rolled
it
empty
between
his
hands
that
missile
was
shot
off
on
purpose
he
said
what
no
you
must
be
sick
that
impossible
i
realize
you
did
know
about
it
only
three
or
four
officers
have
been
told
the
job
had
to
be
done
very
very
secretly
or
there
be
a
scandal
maybe
an
impeachment
but
it
still
sabotage
she
shrank
from
him
you
not
making
sense
their
own
story
does
make
sense
it
ridiculous
a
new
missile
system
would
be
sent
on
a
field
trial
clear
to
the
belt
before
had
enough
tests
closer
to
home
to
get
the
worst
bugs
out
a
missile
would
be
stashed
anywhere
near
something
so
unreliable
let
alone
be
put
under
its
control
the
testing
ship
would
hang
around
a
civilian
station
while
her
gunnery
chief
tinkered
and
hulse
warburton
liebknecht
they
were
asking
in
detail
about
how
we
are
i
ca
believe
it
nobody
will
not
back
home
communication
with
earth
is
so
sparse
and
garbled
the
public
will
only
know
there
was
an
accident
who
give
a
hoot
about
the
details
we
could
even
prove
anything
in
an
asteroid
court
the
navy
would
say
information
and
that
stop
the
proceedings
cold
sure
there
be
a
board
of
inquiry
composed
of
naval
officers
probably
honorable
men
too
but
what
are
they
going
to
believe
the
sworn
word
of
their
goddard
house
colleague
or
the
rantings
of
an
asterite
bum
mike
i
know
this
is
terrible
for
you
but
you
let
it
go
to
your
head
ellen
laid
a
hand
over
his
suppose
the
worst
happens
be
compensated
for
your
loss
yeah
to
the
extent
of
our
personal
investment
the
bank
of
ceres
still
has
nearly
all
the
money
that
was
put
in
we
did
figure
to
have
them
paid
off
for
another
ten
years
they
or
their
insurance
carrier
will
get
the
indemnity
and
after
our
fiasco
they
wo
make
us
a
new
loan
they
were
just
barely
talked
into
it
the
first
time
around
i
daresay
systemic
developments
will
make
them
a
nice
juicy
offer
to
take
this
job
over
ellen
colored
she
stamped
her
foot
you
talking
like
a
paranoiac
do
you
really
believe
the
government
of
north
america
would
send
a
battleship
clear
out
here
to
do
you
dirt
not
the
whole
government
a
few
men
in
the
right
positions
is
all
that
necessary
i
do
know
if
hulse
was
bribed
or
talked
into
this
but
probably
he
agreed
as
a
duty
he
the
prim
type
a
duty
to
destroy
a
north
american
business
chung
finished
at
the
intercom
in
time
to
answer
not
permanent
physical
destruction
miss
ziska
as
mike
suggested
some
corporation
will
doubtless
inherit
the
sword
and
repair
the
damage
but
a
private
purely
asterite
business
yes
i
afraid
mike
right
we
are
the
target
in
mercy
name
why
from
the
highest
motives
of
course
chung
sneered
bitterly
you
know
what
the
social
justice
party
thinks
of
private
capitalism
what
more
important
though
is
that
the
sword
is
the
first
belt
undertaking
not
tied
to
mother
earth
apron
strings
we
have
no
commitments
to
anybody
back
there
we
can
sell
our
output
wherever
we
like
it
notorious
that
the
asterites
are
itching
to
build
up
their
own
industries
quite
apart
from
sentiment
we
can
make
bigger
profits
in
the
belt
than
back
home
especially
when
you
figure
the
cost
of
sending
stuff
in
and
out
of
earth
gravitational
well
so
certainly
we
be
doing
most
of
our
business
out
here
our
charter
ca
simply
be
revoked
first
a
good
many
laws
would
have
to
be
revised
and
that
politically
impossible
there
is
still
a
lot
of
individualist
sentiment
in
north
america
as
witness
the
fact
that
businesses
do
get
launched
and
that
the
essjays
did
have
a
hard
campaign
to
get
elected
what
the
new
government
wants
is
something
like
the
eighteenth
century
english
policy
toward
america
keep
the
colonies
as
a
source
of
raw
materials
and
as
a
market
for
manufactured
goods
but
do
let
them
develop
a
domestic
industry
you
ca
come
right
out
and
say
that
but
you
can
let
the
situation
develop
naturally
only
here
the
sword
is
obviously
bound
to
grow
rich
and
expand
in
every
direction
if
we
allowed
to
develop
to
reinvest
our
profits
we
become
the
nucleus
of
independent
asterite
enterprise
if
on
the
other
hand
we
wiped
out
by
an
unfortunate
accident
there
no
nucleus
and
a
small
change
in
the
banking
laws
is
all
that
needed
to
prevent
others
from
getting
started
i
daresay
hulse
does
think
he
doing
his
patriotic
duty
said
blades
he
wants
to
guarantee
north
america
our
natural
resources
in
the
long
run
maybe
our
allegiance
if
he
has
to
commit
sabotage
too
bad
but
it
wo
cost
him
any
sleep
no
ellen
almost
screamed
chung
sagged
in
his
chair
we
very
neatly
trapped
he
said
like
an
old
man
i
do
see
any
way
out
think
you
can
get
to
work
now
mike
you
can
assign
group
leaders
for
the
evacuation
blades
jumped
erect
i
can
fight
he
growled
with
what
can
openers
you
mean
you
going
to
lie
down
and
let
them
break
us
avis
came
back
she
thrust
the
bottle
into
blades
hands
as
he
paced
the
room
here
you
are
she
said
in
a
distant
voice
he
held
it
out
toward
ellen
have
some
he
invited
not
with
you
you
subversive
avis
brightened
noticeably
took
the
bottle
and
raised
it
then
here
to
victory
she
said
drank
and
passed
it
to
blades
he
started
to
gulp
but
the
wine
was
too
noble
and
he
found
himself
savoring
its
course
down
his
throat
he
thought
vaguely
people
always
speak
with
scorn
about
dutch
courage
the
dutch
have
real
guts
they
fought
themselves
free
of
spain
and
free
of
the
ocean
itself
when
the
french
or
germans
came
they
made
the
enemy
sea
their
the
bottle
fell
from
his
grasp
in
the
weak
acceleration
it
hit
the
floor
when
avis
rescued
it
gim
me
that
you
big
butterfingers
she
exclaimed
her
free
hand
clasped
his
arm
whatever
happens
mike
she
said
to
him
we
not
quitting
still
blades
stared
beyond
her
his
fists
clenched
and
unclenched
the
noise
of
his
breathing
filled
the
room
chung
looked
around
in
bewilderment
ellen
watched
with
waxing
horror
avis
eyes
kindled
holy
smoking
seegars
blades
whispered
at
last
i
really
think
we
can
swing
it
captain
janichevski
recoiled
you
out
of
your
skull
probably
said
blades
fun
huh
you
ca
do
this
we
can
try
do
you
know
what
you
talking
about
insurrection
that
what
quite
likely
piracy
even
if
your
scheme
worked
you
spend
the
next
ten
years
in
rehab
at
least
maybe
provided
the
matter
ever
came
to
trial
but
it
wo
that
what
you
think
you
asking
me
to
compound
the
felony
and
misappropriate
the
property
of
my
owners
to
boot
janichevski
shook
his
head
sorry
mike
i
sorry
as
hell
about
this
mess
but
i
be
party
to
making
it
worse
in
other
words
blades
replied
you
rather
be
party
to
sabotage
i
proposing
an
act
of
legitimate
there
actually
is
a
conspiracy
to
destroy
the
station
adam
you
a
spaceman
you
know
how
the
navy
operates
can
you
swallow
that
story
about
a
missile
getting
loose
by
accident
janichevski
bit
his
lip
the
sounds
from
outside
filled
the
cabin
voices
footfalls
whirr
of
machines
and
clash
of
doors
as
the
readied
for
departure
blades
waited
you
may
be
right
said
janichevski
at
length
wretchedly
though
why
hulse
should
jeopardize
his
career
he
not
there
a
scapegoat
groomed
back
home
you
can
be
sure
like
some
company
that
be
debarred
from
military
contracts
for
a
while
and
get
nice
fat
orders
in
other
fields
i
kicked
around
the
system
enough
to
know
how
that
works
if
you
wrong
though
if
this
is
an
honest
blunder
then
you
risk
committing
treason
yeah
i
take
the
chance
not
i
no
i
got
a
family
to
support
janichevski
said
blades
regarded
him
bleakly
if
the
essjays
get
away
with
this
stunt
what
kind
of
life
will
your
family
be
leading
ten
years
from
now
it
not
simply
that
we
be
peons
in
the
belt
but
tied
hand
and
foot
to
a
shortsighted
government
how
much
progress
will
we
be
able
to
make
other
countries
have
colonies
out
here
too
remember
and
some
of
them
are
already
giving
their
people
a
freer
hand
than
we
got
do
you
want
the
asians
or
the
russians
or
even
the
europeans
to
take
over
the
asteroids
i
ca
make
policy
in
other
words
mama
knows
best
believe
obey
anything
put
out
by
some
bureaucrat
who
never
set
foot
beyond
luna
is
that
your
idea
of
citizenship
you
putting
a
mighty
fine
gloss
on
bailing
yourself
out
janichevski
flared
sure
i
no
idealist
but
neither
am
i
a
slave
blades
hesitated
we
been
friends
too
long
adam
for
me
to
try
bribing
you
but
if
worst
comes
to
worst
we
cover
for
you
somehow
and
if
contrariwise
we
win
then
we
soon
be
hiring
captains
for
our
own
ships
and
you
get
the
best
offer
any
spaceman
ever
got
no
scram
i
work
to
do
blades
braced
himself
i
did
want
to
say
this
but
i
already
informed
a
number
of
my
men
they
as
mad
as
i
am
they
waiting
in
the
terminal
a
monkey
wrench
or
a
laser
torch
makes
a
pretty
fair
weapon
we
can
take
over
by
force
that
leave
you
legally
in
the
clear
but
with
so
many
witnesses
around
you
have
to
prefer
charges
against
us
later
on
janichevski
began
to
sweat
we
be
sent
up
said
blades
but
it
will
still
have
been
worth
it
is
it
really
that
important
to
you
yes
i
admit
i
no
crusader
but
this
is
a
matter
of
principle
janichevski
stared
at
the
big
man
for
a
long
while
suddenly
he
stiffened
on
that
account
and
no
other
i
go
along
with
you
blades
wobbled
on
his
feet
near
collapse
with
relief
good
man
he
croaked
but
i
will
not
have
any
of
my
officers
or
crew
involved
blades
rallied
and
answered
briskly
you
need
just
issue
orders
that
my
boys
are
to
have
access
to
the
scoopships
they
can
install
the
equipment
jockey
the
boats
over
to
the
full
balloons
and
even
couple
them
on
janichevski
fears
had
vanished
once
he
made
his
decision
but
now
a
certain
doubt
registered
that
a
pretty
skilled
job
these
are
pretty
skilled
men
it
is
much
of
a
maneuver
not
like
making
a
jovian
sky
dive
well
i
take
your
word
for
their
ability
but
suppose
the
spots
those
boats
moving
around
she
already
several
hundred
kilometers
off
and
getting
farther
away
running
a
search
curve
which
i
betting
my
liberty
and
my
honor
i
certainly
do
want
to
hurt
my
own
country
navy
betting
that
search
curve
is
guaranteed
not
to
find
the
missile
in
time
they
spot
the
as
you
depart
oh
yes
our
people
will
be
aboard
as
per
orders
but
no
finer
detail
will
show
in
so
casual
an
observation
again
i
take
your
word
what
else
can
i
do
to
help
nothing
you
were
doing
before
leave
the
piratics
to
us
better
get
back
blades
extended
his
hand
i
have
got
the
words
to
thank
you
adam
janichevski
accepted
the
shake
no
reason
for
thanks
you
dragooned
me
a
grin
crossed
his
face
i
must
confess
though
i
not
sorry
you
did
blades
left
he
found
his
gang
in
the
terminal
two
dozen
engineers
and
rockjacks
clumped
tautly
together
what
the
word
carlos
odonaju
shouted
clear
track
blades
said
go
right
aboard
good
fine
i
always
wanted
to
do
something
vicious
and
destructive
odonaju
laughed
the
idea
is
to
prevent
destruction
blades
reminded
him
and
proceeded
toward
the
office
avis
met
him
in
corridor
four
her
freckled
countenance
was
distorted
by
a
scowl
hey
mike
wait
a
minute
she
said
low
and
hurriedly
have
you
seen
la
ziska
the
leftenant
why
no
i
left
her
with
you
remember
hoping
you
could
calm
her
down
she
was
incandescent
mad
called
us
a
pack
of
bandits
and
but
then
she
started
crying
seemed
to
break
down
completely
i
took
her
to
your
cabin
and
went
back
to
help
jimmy
only
when
i
checked
there
a
minute
ago
she
was
gone
what
where
how
should
i
know
but
that
capable
of
anything
to
wreck
our
chances
you
not
being
fair
to
her
she
got
an
oath
to
keep
all
right
said
avis
sweetly
far
be
it
from
me
to
prevent
her
fulfilling
her
obligations
afterward
she
may
even
write
you
an
occasional
letter
i
sure
that
brighten
your
rehab
cell
no
end
what
can
she
do
blades
argued
with
an
uneasy
sense
of
whistling
in
the
dark
she
ca
get
off
the
asteroid
without
a
scooter
and
already
got
sam
gang
working
on
all
the
scooters
is
there
no
other
possibility
the
radio
shack
with
a
man
on
duty
there
that
out
blades
patted
the
girl
arm
i
get
back
to
work
but
i
be
so
glad
when
this
is
over
mike
looking
into
the
desperate
brown
eyes
blades
felt
a
sudden
impulse
to
kiss
their
owner
but
no
there
was
too
much
else
to
do
later
perhaps
he
cocked
a
thumb
upward
carry
on
bad
about
he
thought
as
he
continued
toward
his
office
an
awful
waste
to
make
a
permanent
enemy
of
someone
with
her
kind
of
looks
and
personality
come
off
that
stick
you
clabberhead
she
probably
the
marryin
type
her
shoes
though
what
would
i
do
not
much
they
pinch
my
feet
but
damnation
avis
is
right
she
not
safe
to
have
running
around
loose
the
radio
shack
sparks
is
not
one
of
the
few
been
told
the
whole
story
and
into
the
plan
she
blades
cursed
whirled
and
ran
his
way
was
clear
most
of
the
men
were
still
in
their
dorms
preparing
to
leave
he
traveled
in
huge
leaps
the
radio
shack
rose
out
of
the
surface
near
the
verandah
blades
tried
the
door
it
did
budge
a
chill
went
through
him
he
backed
across
the
corridor
and
charged
the
door
was
only
plastiboard
he
hit
with
a
thud
and
a
grunt
and
rebounded
with
a
numbed
shoulder
but
it
looked
so
easy
for
the
cops
on
no
time
to
figure
out
the
delicate
art
of
forcible
entry
he
hurled
himself
against
the
panel
again
and
again
heedless
of
the
pain
that
struck
in
flesh
and
bone
when
the
door
finally
splinteringly
gave
way
he
stumbled
clear
across
the
room
beyond
fetched
up
against
an
instrument
console
recovered
his
balance
and
gaped
the
operator
lay
on
the
floor
swearing
in
a
steady
monotone
he
had
been
efficiently
bound
with
his
own
blouse
and
trousers
which
revealed
his
predilection
for
maroon
shorts
with
zebra
stripes
there
was
a
lump
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
a
hammer
lay
close
by
ellen
must
have
stolen
the
tool
and
come
in
here
with
the
thing
behind
her
back
the
operator
would
have
had
no
reason
to
suspect
her
she
had
not
left
the
sender
chair
not
even
while
the
door
was
under
attack
only
a
carrier
beam
connected
the
sword
with
the
she
continued
doggedly
to
fumble
with
dials
and
switches
trying
to
modulate
it
and
raise
the
ship
praises
be
you
have
had
advanced
training
in
radio
blades
choked
that
a
set
pretty
special
system
he
weaved
toward
her
come
along
now
she
spat
an
unladylike
refusal
theoretically
blades
should
have
enjoyed
the
tussle
that
followed
but
he
was
in
poor
shape
at
the
outset
and
he
was
a
good
deal
worse
off
by
the
time
he
got
her
pinioned
he
wheezed
will
you
come
quietly
she
did
deign
to
answer
unless
you
counted
her

him
in
the
nose
he
had
to
yell
for
help
to
her

calling
nass
come
in
the
great
ovoid
swung
clear
in
space
among
a
million
cold
stars
the
asteroid
had
dwindled
out
of
sight
a
radio
beam
flickered
across
emptiness
within
the
hull
the
crew
and
a
hundred
refugees
sat
jammed
together
the
air
was
thick
with
their
breath
and
sweat
and
waiting
blades
and
chung
seated
by
the
transmitter
felt
another
kind
of
thickness
the
pull
of
the
internal
field
weight
dragged
down
every
movement
the
enclosed
cabin
began
to
feel
suffocatingly
small
get
used
to
it
again
pretty
quickly
blades
thought
bodies
would
that
is
but
our
own
selves
tied
down
to
earth
forever
the

his

a
quizzical

we

first
at

obvious
exhaustion
then
at
the
black

and
assorted
bruises

i
put
the
message
through
channel
red
at
once
sir
the
screen
blanked
well
here
we
go

said
i
wonder
how
the
food
in
rehab
is
these
days
want
me
to
do
the
talking
blades
asked
chung
was
built
for
times
as
hectic
as
the
last
few
hours
and
was
worn
to
a
nubbin
he
himself
felt
immensely
keyed
up
he
always
liked
a
good
fight
sure
chung
pulled
a
crumpled
cigarette
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
fill
the
cabin
with
smoke
you
have
a
larger
stock
of
rudeness
than
i
illustration
presently
the
screen
showed
hulse
rigid
at
his
post
on
the
bridge
good
day
gentlemen
he
said
what
the
trouble
plenty
blades
answered
clear
everybody
else
out
of
there
let
your
ship
orbit
free
a
while
and
seal
your
circuit
hulse
reddened
who
do
you
think
you
are
well
my
birth
certificate
says
michael
joseph
blades
i
got
some
news
for
you
concerning
that
gadget
you
told
us
about
you
would
want
unauthorized
personnel
listening
in
hulse
leaned
forward
till
he
seemed
about
to
fall
through
the
screen
what
this
about
a
hazard
fact
the
is
in
distinct
danger
of
getting
blown
to
bits
have
you
gone
crazy
get
me
the
captain
of
the
very
small
bits
hulse
compressed
his
lips
all
right
i
listen
to
you
for
a
short
time
you
had
better
make
it
worth
my
while
he
spoke
orders
blades
scratched
his
back
while
he
waited
for
the
bridge
to
be
emptied
and
wondered
if
there
was
any
chance
of
a
hot
shower
in
the
near
future
done
said
hulse
give
me
your
report
blades
glanced
at
the
telltale
you
have
sealed
your
circuit
admiral
hulse
said
angry
words
but
complied
now
will
you
talk
sure
this
secrecy
is
for
your
own
protection
you
risk
otherwise
hulse
suppressed
a
retort
here
the
word
blades
met
the
transmitted
glare
with
an
almost
palpable
crash
of
eyeballs
we
decided
chung
and
i
that
any
missile
rig
as
haywire
as
yours
represents
a
menace
to
navigation
and
public
safety
if
you
ca
control
your
own
nuclear
weapons
you
should
be
at
large
our
charter
gives
us
local
authority
as
peace
officers
by
virtue
thereof
and
so
on
and
so
forth
we
ordered
certain
precautionary
steps
taken
as
a
result
if
that
war
head
goes
off
sorry
to
say
that
nass
will
be
destroyed
are
you
have
you
hulse
congealed
in
spite
of
everything
he
was
a
competent
officer
blades
decided
please
explain
yourself
he
said
without
tone
sure
blades
obliged
the
station
has
got
any
armament
but
trust
the
human
race
to
juryrig
that
we
commandeered
the
scoopships
belonging
to
this
vessel
and
loaded
them
with
jovian
gas
at
maximum
pressure
if
your
missile
detonates
they
dive
on
you
something
like
amusement
tinged
hulse
shocked
expression
do
you
seriously
consider
that
a
weapon
i
seriously
do
let
me
explain
the
ships
are
orbiting
free
right
now
scattered
through
quite
a
large
volume
of
space
nobody
aboard
them
what
is
aboard
each
one
though
is
an
autopilot
taken
from
a
scooter
hooked
into
the
drive
controls
each
has
its
sensors
locked
onto
your
ship
you
ca
maneuver
fast
enough
to
shake
off
radar
beams
and
mass
detectors
you
the
target
object
and
nothing
to
tell
those
idiot
computers
to
decelerate
as
they
approach
you
of
course
no
approach
is
being
made
yet
a
switch
has
been
put
in
every
scooter
circuit
and
left
open
only
the
meteorite
evasion
units
are
operative
right
now
that
is
if
anyone
tried
to
lay
alongside
one
of
those
scoopships
he
be
detected
and
the
ship
would
skitter
away
remember
a
scoopship
has
much
mass
and
she
does
have
engines
designed
for
diving
in
and
out
of
jupe
gravitational
well
she
can
either
of
our
vessels
or
any
boat
of
yours
and
any
of
your
missiles
you
ca
catch
her
hulse
snorted
what
the
significance
of
this
farce
i
said
the
autopilots
were
switched
off
at
the
moment
as
far
as
heading
for
the
target
is
concerned
but
each
of
those
switches
is
coupled
to
two
other
units
one
is
simply
the
sensor
box
if
you
withdraw
beyond
a
certain
distance
the
switches
will
close
that
is
the
will
be
turned
on
if
you
try
to
go
beyond
range
of
the
beams
now
locked
onto
you
the
other
unit
we
installed
in
every
boat
is
an
ordinary
radiation
meter
if
a
nuclear
weapon
goes
off
anywhere
within
a
couple
of
thousand
kilometers
the
switches
will
also
close
in
either
of
those
cases
the
scoopships
will
dive
on
you
you
might
knock
out
a
few
with
missiles
before
they
strike
undoubtedly
you
can
punch
holes
in
them
with
laser
guns
but
that
wo
do
any
good
except
when
you
lucky
enough
to
hit
a
vital
part
nobody
aboard
to
be
killed
not
even
much
gas
will
be
lost
in
so
short
a
time
so
to
summarize
chum
if
that
rogue
missile
explodes
your
ship
will
be
struck
by
ten
to
twenty
scoopships
each
crammed
full
of
concentrated
jovian
air
they
pierce
that
thin
hull
of
yours
but
since
they
already
pumped
full
beyond
the
margin
of
safety
the
impact
will
split
them
open
and
the
gas
will
whoosh
out
do
you
know
what
jovian
air
does
to
substances
like
magnesium
you
can
probably
save
your
crew
take
to
the
boats
and
reach
a
commission
base
but
your
nice
battleship
will
be
is
your
game
worth
that
candle
you
totally
insane
releasing
such
a
thing
oh
not
permanently
there
one
more
switch
on
each
boat
connected
to
the
meteorite
evasion
unit
and
controlled
by
a
small
battery
when
those
batteries
run
down
in
about
twenty
hours
the
will
be
turned
off
completely
then
we
can
spot
the
scoopships
by
radar
and
pick
up
and
you
be
free
to
leave
do
you
think
for
one
instant
that
your
fantastic
claim
of
acting
legally
will
stand
up
in
court
no
probably
not
but
it
wo
have
to
obviously
you
ca
make
anybody
swallow
your
yarn
if
a
missile
gets
loose
and
as
for
the
first
one
since
it
failed
in
its
purpose
your
bosses
going
to
want
the
matter
publicized
it
embarrass
them
to
no
end
and
serve
no
purpose
except
revenge
on
jimmy
and
me
which
there
no
point
in
taking
since
the
sword
would
still
be
privately
owned
you
check
with
earth
admiral
before
shooting
off
your
mouth
tell
you
that
both
parties
to
this
quarrel
had
better
forget
about
legal
action
both
would
lose
so
i
afraid
your
only
choice
is
to
find
that
missile
before
it
goes
off
and
yours
what
are
your
alternatives
hulse
had
gone
gray
in
the
face
but
he
still
spoke
stoutly
blades
grinned
at
him
none
whatsoever
we
burned
our
bridges
we
ca
do
anything
about
those
scoopships
now
so
it
no
use
trying
to
scare
us
or
arrest
us
or
whatever
else
may
occur
to
you
what
done
is
establish
an
automatic
deterrent
against
an
an
attempt
at
sabotage
that
only
exists
in
your
imagination
blades
shrugged
that
argument
is
relevant
any
longer
i
do
believe
the
missile
was
released
deliberately
we
would
have
done
what
we
did
otherwise
but
there
no
longer
any
point
in
making
charges
and
denials
you
just
better
retrieve
the
thing
hulse
squared
his
shoulders
how
do
i
know
you
telling
the
truth
well
you
can
send
a
man
to
the
station
he
find
the
scooters
lying
gutted
send
another
man
over
here
to
the
he
find
the
scoopships
gone
i
also
took
a
few
photographs
of
the
autopilots
being
installed
and
the
ships
being
cast
adrift
go
right
ahead
however
may
i
remind
you
that
the
fewer
people
who
have
an
inkling
of
this
little
intrigue
the
better
for
all
concerned
hulse
opened
his
mouth
shut
it
again
stared
from
side
to
side
and
finally
slumped
the
barest
bit
very
well
he
said
biting
off
the
words
syllable
by
syllable
i
ca
risk
a
ship
of
the
line
of
course
since
the
rogue
is
still
farther
away
than
your
deterrent
allows
the
to
go
we
shall
have
to
wait
in
space
a
while
i
do
mind
i
shall
report
the
full
story
to
my
superiors
at
home
but
unofficially
good
i
like
them
to
know
that
we
asterites
have
teeth
signing
off
then
chung
stirred
wait
a
bit
he
said
we
have
one
of
your
people
aboard
lieutenant
ziska
can
you
send
a
gig
for
her
she
did
collaborate
with
us
blades
added
you
can
see
the
evidence
of
her
loyalty
all
over
my
mug
good
girl
hulse
exclaimed
savagely
yes
i
send
a
boat
signing
off
the
screen
blanked
chung
and
blades
let
out
a
long
ragged
breath
they
sat
a
while
trembling
before
chung
muttered
that
skunk
as
good
as
admitted
everything
sure
said
blades
but
we
wo
have
any
more
trouble
from
him
chung
stubbed
out
his
cigarette
poise
was
returning
to
both
men
there
could
be
other
attempts
though
in
the
next
few
years
he
scowled
i
think
we
should
arm
the
station
a
couple
of
laser
guns
if
nothing
else
we
can
say
it
for
protection
in
case
of
war
but
it
make
our
own
government
handle
us
more
carefully
too
well
you
can
approach
the
commission
about
it
blades
yawned
and
stretched
trying
to
loosen
his
muscles
better
get
a
lot
of
other
owners
and
supervisors
to
sign
your
petition
though
the
next
order
of
business
came
to
his
mind
he
rose
why
do
you
go
tell
adam
the
good
news
where
are
you
bound
to
let
ellen
know
the
fight
is
over
is
it
as
far
as
she
concerned
that
what
i
about
to
find
out
hope
i
wo
need
an
armored
escort
blades
went
from
the
cubicle
past
the
watchful
radioman
and
down
the
deserted
passageway
beyond
the
cabin
given
her
lay
at
the
end
locked
from
outside
the
key
hung
magnetically
on
the
bulkhead
blades
unlocked
the
door
and
tapped
it
with
his
knuckles
who
there
she
called
me
he
said
may
i
come
in
if
you
must
she
said
freezingly
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
through
the
overhead
light
shimmered
off
her
hair
and
limned
her
figure
with
shadows
his
heart
bumped
you
uh
you
can
come
out
now
he
faltered
everything
she
said
nothing
only
regarded
him
from
eyes
no
harm
been
done
except
to
me
and
sparks
and
we
not
mad
he
groped
shall
we
forget
the
whole
episode
if
you
wish
ellen
he
pleaded
i
had
to
do
what
seemed
right
to
me
so
did
i
he
could
find
any
more
words
i
assume
that
i
be
returned
to
my
own
ship
she
said
he
nodded
then
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
had
best
make
myself
as
presentable
as
i
can
good
day
mr
blades
what
good
about
it
he
snarled
and
slammed
the
door
on
his
way
out
avis
stood
outside
the
jampacked
saloon
she
saw
him
coming
and
ran
to
meet
him
he
made
with
his
fingers
and
joy
blazed
from
her
mike
she
cried
i
so
happy
the
only
gentlemanly
thing
to
do
was
hug
her
his
spirits
lifted
a
bit
as
he
did
she
made
a
nice
armful
not
bad
looking
either
well
said
amspaugh
so
that
the
inside
story
how
very
interesting
i
never
heard
it
before
no
obviously
it
never
got
into
any
official
record
missy
said
the
only
announcement
made
was
that
there
been
a
near
accident
that
the
station
tried
to
make
out
of
scoopships
but
that
the
quick
action
of
nass
was
what
saved
the
situation
her
captain
was
commended
i
do
believe
he
ever
got
a
further
promotion
though
why
did
you
publicize
the
facts
afterwards
lindgren
wondered
when
the
revolution
began
that
is
it
would
made
good
propaganda
nonsense
missy
said
too
much
else
had
happened
since
then
besides
neither
mike
nor
jimmy
nor
i
wanted
to
do
any
cheap
we
knew
the
asterites
were
any
little
angels
nor
the
people
back
sunward
a
crew
of
devils
there
were
rights
and
wrongs
on
both
sides
we
did
what
we
could
in
the
war
and
hated
every
minute
of
it
and
when
it
was
over
we
broke
out
two
cases
of
champagne
and
invited
as
many
earthsiders
as
we
could
get
to
the
party
they
had
a
lot
of
love
to
carry
home
for
us
a
stillness
fell
she
took
a
long
swallow
from
her
glass
and
sat
looking
out
at
the
stars
yes
lindgren
said
finally
i
guess
that
was
the
worst
fighting
against
our
own
kin
well
i
was
better
off
in
that
respect
than
some
missy
conceded
i
made
my
commitment
so
long
before
the
trouble
that
my
ties
were
nearly
all
out
here
twenty
years
is
time
enough
to
grow
new
roots
really
orloff
was
surprised
i
have
met
you
often
before
blades
so
evidently
i
had
a
false
impression
i
thought
you
were
a
more
recent
immigrant
than
that
shucks
no
she
laughed
i
only
needed
six
months
after
the
incident
to
think
things
out
resign
my
commission
and
catch
the
next
ship
you
do
think
i
have
let
a
man
like
mike
get
away
do
you
