the

why
what
the
matter
child
tell
me
nothing
dad
really
nothing
but
you
are
breathing
hard
your
hand
trembles
your
pulse
beats
quickly
there
something
amiss
i
sure
there
is
now
what
is
it
come
no
secrets
the
girl
quickly
snatching
away
her
hand
answered
with
a
forced
laugh
how
absurd
you
really
are
dear
old
dad
you
always
fancying
something
or
other
because
my
senses
of
hearing
and
feeling
are
sharper
and
more
developed
than
those
of
other
folk
perhaps
replied
the
old
gentleman
as
he
turned
his
grey
but
expressionless
countenance
to
the
tall
girl
standing
beside
his
chair
no
second
glance
was
needed
to
realise
the
pitiful
truth
the
man
seated
there
in
his
fine
library
with
the
summer
sunset
slanting
across
the
red
carpet
from
the
open
french
windows
was
blind
since
his
daughter
gabrielle
had
been
a
pretty
prattling
child
of
nine
nursing
her
dolly
he
had
never
looked
upon
her
fair
face
but
he
was
ever
as
devoted
to
her
as
she
to
him
surely
his
was
a
sad
and
lonely
life
within
the
last
fifteen
years
or
so
great
wealth
had
come
to
him
but
alas
he
was
unable
to
enjoy
it
until
eleven
years
ago
he
had
been
a
prominent
figure
in
politics
and
in
society
in
london
he
had
sat
in
the
house
for
one
of
the
divisions
of
hampshire
was
a
member
of
the
carlton
and
one
year
he
found
his
name
among
the
birthday
honours
with
a
for
him
everybody
predicted
a
brilliant
future
the
press
gave
prominence
to
his
speeches
and
to
his
house
in
park
street
came
cabinet
ministers
and
most
of
the
men
of
his
party
indeed
it
was
an
open
secret
in
a
certain
circle
that
he
had
been
promised
a
seat
in
the
cabinet
in
the
near
future
then
at
the
very
moment
of
his
popularity
a
terrible
tragedy
had
occurred
he
was
on
the
platform
of
the
albert
hall
addressing
a
great
meeting
at
which
the
prime
minister
was
the
principal
speaker
his
speech
was
a
brilliant
one
and
the
applause
had
been
vociferous
full
of
satisfaction
he
drove
home
that
night
to
park
street
but
next
morning
the
report
spread
that
his
brilliant
political
career
had
ended
he
had
suddenly
been
stricken
by
blindness
in
political
circles
and
in
the
clubs
the
greatest
consternation
was
caused
and
some
strange
gossip
became
rife
it
was
whispered
in
certain
quarters
that
the
affliction
was
not
produced
by
natural
causes
in
fact
it
was
a
mystery
and
one
that
had
never
been
solved
the
first
oculists
of
europe
had
peered
into
and
tested
his
eyes
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
sight
had
gone
for
ever
therefore
full
of
bitter
regrets
at
being
thus
compelled
to
renounce
the
stress
and
storm
of
political
life
which
he
loved
so
well
sir
henry
heyburn
had
gone
into
strict
retirement
at
glencardine
his
beautiful
old
perthshire
home
visiting
london
but
very
seldom
he
was
essentially
a
man
of
mystery
even
in
the
days
of
his
universal
popularity
the
source
of
his
vast
wealth
was
unknown
his
father
the
tenth
baronet
had
been
sadly
impoverished
by
the
depreciation
of
agricultural
property
in
lincolnshire
and
had
ended
his
days
in
the
genteel
quietude
of
the
albany
but
sir
henry
without
betraying
to
the
world
his
methods
had
in
fifteen
years
amassed
a
fortune
which
people
guessed
must
be
considerably
over
a
million
sterling
from
a
life
of
strenuous
activity
he
had
in
one
single
hour
been
doomed
to
one
of
loneliness
and
inactivity
his
friends
sympathised
as
indeed
the
whole
british
public
had
done
but
in
a
month
the
tragic
affair
and
its
attendant
mysterious
gossip
had
been
forgotten
as
in
truth
had
the
very
name
of
sir
henry
heyburn
whom
the
prime
minister
though
his
political
opponent
had
one
night
designated
in
the
house
as
one
of
the
most
brilliant
and
talented
young
men
who
has
ever
sat
upon
the
opposition
benches
in
his
declining
years
the
life
of
this
man
was
a
pitiful
tragedy
his
filmy
eyes
sightless
his
thin
white
fingers
ever
eager
and
nervous
his
hours
full
of
deep
thought
and
silent
immobility
to
him
what
was
the
benefit
of
that
beautiful
perthshire
castle
which
he
had
purchased
from
lord
strathavon
a
year
before
his
compulsory
retirement
what
was
the
use
of
the
old
ancestral
manor
near
caistor
in
lincolnshire
or
the
in
park
street
the
snug
at
melton
or
the
beautiful
villa
overlooking
the
blue
southern
sea
at
san
remo
he
remembered
them
all
he
had
misty
visions
of
their
splendour
and
their
luxury
but
since
his
blindness
he
had
seldom
if
ever
entered
them
that
big
library
up
in
scotland
in
which
he
now
sat
was
the
room
he
preferred
and
with
his
daughter
gabrielle
to
bear
him
company
to
smooth
his
brow
with
her
soft
hand
to
chatter
and
to
gossip
he
wished
for
no
other
companion
his
life
was
of
the
past
a
meteor
that
had
flashed
and
had
vanished
for
ever
tell
me
child
what
is
troubling
you
he
was
asking
in
a
calm
kind
voice
as
he
still
held
the
girl
hand
in
his
the
sweet
scent
of
the
roses
from
the
garden
beyond
filled
the
room
a
smart
footman
in
livery
opened
the
door
at
that
moment
asking
stokes
has
just
returned
with
the
car
from
perth
sir
henry
and
asks
if
you
want
him
further
at
present
no
replied
his
blind
master
has
he
brought
back
her
ladyship
yes
sir
henry
replied
the
man
i
believe
he
is
taking
her
to
the
ball
over
at
connachan
oh
yes
of
course
how
foolish
i
am
i
quite
forgot
said
the
baronet
with
a
slight
sigh
very
well
hill
and
the
young
man
with
his
bright
buttons
bearing
the
chevron
betwixt
three
boars
heads
erased
of
the
heyburns
bowed
and
withdrew
i
had
quite
forgotten
the
ball
at
connachan
dear
exclaimed
her
father
stretching
out
his
thin
white
hand
in
search
of
hers
again
of
course
you
are
going
no
dad
i
staying
at
home
with
you
staying
at
home
echoed
sir
henry
why
my
dear
gabrielle
the
first
year
you
out
and
missing
the
best
ball
in
the
county
certainly
not
i
all
right
i
sha
be
lonely
a
little
box
came
this
morning
from
the
professor
did
it
yes
dad
then
i
shall
be
able
to
spend
the
evening
very
well
alone
the
professor
has
sent
me
what
he
promised
the
other
day
i
decided
not
to
go
was
the
girl
firm
reply
i
fear
dear
your
mother
will
be
very
annoyed
if
you
refuse
he
remarked
i
shall
risk
that
dear
old
dad
and
stay
with
you
please
allow
me
she
added
persuasively
taking
his
hand
in
hers
and
bending
till
her
red
lips
touched
his
white
brow
you
have
quite
a
lot
to
do
remember
a
big
packet
of
papers
came
from
paris
this
morning
i
must
read
them
over
to
you
but
your
mother
my
dear
your
absence
will
be
commented
upon
people
will
gossip
you
know
there
is
but
one
person
i
care
for
dad
yourself
laughed
the
girl
lightly
perhaps
you
disappointed
over
a
new
frock
or
something
eh
not
at
all
my
frock
came
from
town
the
day
before
yesterday
elise
declares
it
suits
me
admirably
and
she
very
hard
to
please
you
know
it
white
trimmed
with
tiny
roses
a
perfect
dream
i
expect
remarked
the
blind
man
smiling
i
wish
i
could
see
you
in
it
dear
i
often
wonder
what
you
are
like
now
that
you
grown
to
be
a
woman
i
like
what
i
always
have
been
dad
i
suppose
she
laughed
yes
yes
he
sighed
in
pretence
of
being
troubled
wilful
as
always
and
and
he
faltered
a
moment
later
i
often
hear
your
dear
dead
mother
voice
in
yours
then
he
was
silent
and
by
the
deep
lines
in
his
brow
she
knew
that
he
was
thinking
outside
in
the
high
elms
beyond
the
level
lawn
with
its
grey
old
sundial
the
homecoming
rooks
were
cawing
prior
to
settling
down
for
the
night
no
other
sound
broke
the
stillness
of
that
quiet
sunset
hour
save
the
solemn
ticking
of
the
long
clock
at
the
farther
end
of
the
big
room
with
its
wide
fireplace
great
overmantel
of
carved
stone
with
emblazoned
arms
and
its
three
long
windows
of
old
stained
glass
which
gave
it
a
somewhat
ecclesiastical
aspect
tell
me
child
repeated
sir
henry
at
length
what
was
it
that
upset
you
just
now
nothing
dad
unless
well
perhaps
it
the
heat
i
felt
rather
unwell
when
i
went
out
for
my
ride
this
morning
she
answered
with
a
frantic
attempt
at
excuse
the
blind
man
was
well
aware
that
her
reply
was
but
a
subterfuge
little
however
did
he
dream
the
cause
little
did
he
know
that
a
dark
shadow
had
fallen
upon
the
young
girl
life
a
shadow
of
evil
gabrielle
he
said
in
a
low
intense
voice
why
are
you
open
and
frank
with
me
as
you
once
used
to
be
remember
that
you
my
daughter
are
my
only
friend
slim
dainty
and
with
a
sweet
dimpled
face
and
blue
eyes
large
and
clear
like
a
child
a
white
throat
a
head
and
hair
dressed
low
with
a
large
black
bow
she
presented
the
picture
of
happy
careless
youth
her
features
soft
and
refined
her
arms
well
moulded
and
hands
delicate
and
white
she
wore
only
one
ornament
upon
her
left
hand
was
a
small
with
her
monogram
engraved
a
gift
from
one
of
her
governesses
when
a
child
and
now
worn
upon
the
little
finger
that
face
was
strikingly
beautiful
it
had
been
remarked
more
than
once
in
london
but
any
admiration
only
called
forth
the
covert
sneers
of
lady
heyburn
why
do
you
tell
me
urged
the
blind
man
why
do
you
tell
me
the
truth
he
protested
her
countenance
changed
when
she
heard
his
words
in
her
blue
eyes
was
a
look
of
abject
fear
her
left
hand
was
tightly
clenched
and
her
mouth
set
hard
as
though
in
resolution
i
really
do
know
what
you
mean
dad
she
responded
with
a
hollow
laugh
you
have
such
strange
fancies
nowadays
strange
fancies
child
echoed
the
afflicted
man
lifting
his
grey
expressionless
face
to
hers
a
blind
man
has
always
vague
suspicious
and
black
forebodings
engendered
by
the
darkness
and
loneliness
of
his
life
i
am
no
exception
he
sighed
i
think
ever
of
the
no
dear
exclaimed
the
girl
bending
until
her
lips
touched
his
white
brow
softly
forget
it
all
dear
old
dad
surely
your
days
here
with
me
quiet
and
healthful
in
this
beautiful
perthshire
are
better
better
by
far
than
if
you
had
been
a
politician
up
in
london
ever
struggling
ever
speaking
and
ever
bearing
the
long
hours
at
the
house
and
the
eternal
stress
of
parliamentary
life
yes
yes
he
said
just
a
trifle
impatiently
it
is
not
that
i
regret
that
i
had
to
retire
except
well
except
for
your
sake
perhaps
dear
for
my
sake
how
because
had
i
been
a
member
of
this
cabinet
which
some
of
my
friends
predicted
you
would
have
had
the
chance
of
a
good
marriage
but
buried
as
you
are
down
here
instead
what
chances
have
you
i
want
no
chance
dad
replied
the
girl
i
shall
never
marry
a
painful
thought
crossed
the
old
man
mind
being
mirrored
upon
his
brow
by
the
deep
lines
which
puckered
there
for
a
few
brief
moments
well
he
exclaimed
smiling
that
surely
no
reason
why
you
should
not
go
to
the
ball
at
connachan
i
have
my
duty
to
perform
dad
my
duty
is
to
remain
with
you
she
said
decisively
you
know
you
have
quite
a
lot
to
do
and
when
your
mother
has
gone
we
spend
an
hour
or
two
here
at
work
i
hear
that
walter
murie
is
at
home
again
at
connachan
hill
told
me
this
morning
remarked
her
father
so
i
heard
also
answered
the
girl
and
yet
you
are
not
going
to
the
ball
gabrielle
eh
laughed
the
old
man
mischievously
now
come
dad
the
girl
exclaimed
colouring
slightly
you
really
too
bad
i
thought
you
had
promised
me
not
to
mention
him
again
so
i
did
dear
i
i
quite
forgot
replied
sir
henry
apologetically
forgive
me
you
are
now
your
own
mistress
if
you
prefer
to
stay
away
from
connachan
then
do
so
by
all
means
only
make
a
proper
excuse
to
your
mother
otherwise
she
will
be
annoyed
i
think
not
dear
his
daughter
replied
in
a
meaning
tone
if
i
remain
at
home
she
be
rather
glad
than
otherwise
why
inquired
the
old
man
quickly
the
girl
hesitated
she
saw
instantly
that
her
remark
was
an
unfortunate
one
well
she
said
rather
lamely
because
my
absence
will
relieve
her
of
the
responsibility
of
acting
as
chaperon
what
else
could
she
say
how
could
she
tell
her
father
the
kindly
but
afflicted
man
to
whom
she
was
devoted
the
bitter
truth
his
lonely
dismal
life
was
surely
sufficiently
hard
to
bear
without
the
extra
burden
of
suspicion
of
enforced
inactivity
of
fierce
hatred
and
of
bitter
regret
so
she
slowly
disengaged
her
hand
kissed
him
again
and
with
an
excuse
that
she
had
the
menus
to
write
for
the
went
out
leaving
him
alone
when
the
door
had
closed
a
great
sigh
sounded
through
the
long
room
a
sigh
that
ended
in
a
sob
the
old
man
had
leaned
his
chin
upon
his
hands
and
his
sightless
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
is
it
the
truth
he
murmured
to
himself
is
it
really
the
truth
chapter
ii
from
out
the
night
there
are
few
of
the
perthshire
castles
that
more
plainly
declare
their
feudal
origin
and
exhibit
traces
of
obsolete
power
than
does
the
great
gaunt
pile
of
ruins
known
as
glencardine
its
situation
is
both
picturesque
and
imposing
and
the
stern
aspect
of
the
two
square
baronial
towers
which
face
the
south
perched
on
a
sheer
precipice
that
descends
to
the
ruthven
water
deep
below
shows
that
the
castle
was
once
the
residence
of
a
predatory
chief
in
the
days
before
its
association
with
the
great
montrose
two
miles
from
the
long
straggling
village
of
auchterarder
in
the
centre
of
a
fine
estate
the
great
ruined
castle
stands
a
silent
monument
of
warlike
days
long
since
forgotten
there
within
those
walls
now
overgrown
with
ivy
and
weeds
and
where
big
trees
grow
in
the
centre
of
what
was
once
the
great
paved
courtyard
montrose
schemed
and
plotted
and
according
to
tradition
kept
certain
of
his
enemies
in
the
dungeons
below
in
the
twelfth
century
the
aspect
of
the
deep
glen
was
very
different
from
what
it
is
in
those
days
the
ruthven
was
a
broad
river
flowing
swiftly
down
to
the
earn
and
forming
by
reason
of
a
moat
an
effective
barrier
against
attack
however
the
river
has
diminished
into
a
mere
burn
meandering
through
a
beautiful
wooded
glen
three
hundred
feet
below
a
glen
the
charms
of
which
are
well
known
throughout
the
whole
of
scotland
and
where
in
summer
tourists
from
england
endeavour
to
explore
but
are
warned
back
by
stewart
sir
henry
highland
keeper
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
great
historic
ruin
is
the
modern
castle
built
mainly
of
stone
from
the
ancient
structure
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
with
rooms
many
quaint
gables
stained
glass
and
long
echoing
corridors
a
residence
well
adapted
for
entertaining
on
a
lavish
scale
the
front
overlooking
the
beautiful
glen
and
the
back
with
level
lawns
and
stretch
of
undulating
park
well
wooded
and
full
of
picturesque
beauty
the
family
traditions
and
history
of
the
old
place
and
its
owners
had
induced
sir
henry
heyburn
himself
a
fellow
of
the
society
of
antiquaries
to
purchase
it
from
lord
strathavon
into
whose
possession
it
had
passed
some
forty
years
previously
history
showed
that
william
de
graeme
or
graham
who
settled
in
scotland
in
the
twelfth
century
became
lord
of
glencardine
and
the
great
castle
was
built
by
his
son
they
were
indeed
a
noble
race
as
their
biographer
has
explained
ever
fearless
in
their
country
cause
they
sneered
at
the
mandates
from
impregnable
stirling
and
were
loyal
in
every
generation
glencardine
was
a
stronghold
feared
by
all
the
surrounding
nobles
and
its
men
were
full
of
valour
and
bravery
one
story
of
them
is
perhaps
worth
the
telling
in
the
year
the
abbot
of
inchaffray
issued
an
order
for
the
collection
of
the
teinds
of
the
killearns
lands
possessed
by
the
grahams
of
glencardine
in
the
parish
of
monzievaird
of
which
he
was
titular
the
order
was
rigorously
executed
the
teinds
being
exacted
by
force
lord
killearn
of
dunning
castle
was
from
home
at
the
time
but
in
his
absence
his
eldest
son
william
master
of
dunning
called
out
a
number
of
his
clansmen
and
marched
towards
glencardine
for
the
purpose
of
putting
a
stop
to
the
abbot
proceedings
the
grahams
of
glencardine
having
been
apprised
of
their
neighbour
intention
mustered
in
strong
force
and
marched
to
meet
him
the
opposing
forces
encountered
each
other
at
the
north
side
of
knock
mary
about
two
miles
to
the
of
crieff
while
a
number
of
the
clan
who
lived
beside
the
loch
of
balloch
marched
up
the
south
side
of
the
hill
halting
at
the
top
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
combat
the
fight
began
with
great
fury
on
both
sides
the
glencardine
men
however
began
to
get
the
upper
hand
and
drive
their
opponents
back
when
the
rushed
down
the
hill
to
the
succour
of
the
killearns
the
tables
were
now
turned
the
grahams
were
unable
to
maintain
their
ground
against
the
combined
forces
which
they
had
now
to
face
and
fled
towards
glencardine
taking
refuge
in
the
kirk
of
monzievaird
the
killearns
had
no
desire
to
follow
up
their
success
any
farther
but
at
this
stage
they
were
joined
by
duncan
campbell
of
dunstaffnage
who
had
come
across
from
argyllshire
to
avenge
the
death
of
his
robert
of
monzie
who
along
with
his
two
sons
had
a
short
time
before
been
killed
by
the
lord
of
glencardine
an
arrow
shot
from
the
church
fatally
wounded
one
of
campbell
men
and
so
enraged
were
the
besiegers
at
this
that
they
set
fire
to
the
building
of
the
one
hundred
and
sixty
human
beings
who
are
supposed
to
have
been
in
the
church
only
one
young
lad
escaped
and
this
was
effected
by
the
help
of
one
of
the
killearns
who
caught
the
boy
in
his
arms
as
he
leaped
out
of
the
flames
the
killearns
did
not
go
unpunished
for
their
barbarous
deed
their
leader
with
several
of
his
chief
retainers
was
afterwards
beheaded
at
stirling
and
an
assessment
was
imposed
on
the
killearns
for
behoof
of
the
wives
and
children
of
the
grahams
who
had
perished
by
their
hands
the
killearn
by
whose
aid
the
young
graham
had
been
saved
was
forced
to
flee
to
ireland
but
he
afterwards
returned
to
scotland
where
he
and
his
attendants
were
known
by
the
name
of
killearn
eirinich
or
ernoch
meaning
killearn
of
ireland
the
estate
which
he
held
and
which
is
situated
near
comrie
still
bears
that
name
the
site
of
the
kirk
of
monzievaird
is
now
occupied
by
the
mausoleum
of
the
family
of
murray
of
ochtertyre
which
was
erected
in
when
the
foundations
were
being
excavated
a
large
quantity
of
charred
bones
and
wood
was
found
the
history
of
scotland
is
full
of
references
to
the
doings
at
glencardine
the
fine
home
of
the
great
lord
glencardine
and
of
events
both
in
the
original
stronghold
and
in
the
present
mansion
which
have
had
important
bearings
upon
the
welfare
of
the
country
in
the
autumn
of
the
celebrated
poetess
baroness
nairne
who
had
been
born
at
gask
a
few
miles
away
visited
glencardine
and
spent
several
weeks
in
the
pleasantest
manner
within
those
gaunt
ruins
of
the
old
castle
she
first
became
inspired
to
write
her
celebrated
castell
gloom
near
dollar
oh
castell

strength
is
gone

mirk
was
the
misty
cloud
that
hung
thy

thou
wert
like
beauty
in
a
shroud
and
all
was
solitude
a
volume
indeed
could
be
written
upon
the
history
traditions
and
superstitions
of
glencardine
castle
a
subject
in
which
its
blind
owner
took
the
keenest
possible
interest
but
tragedy
of
it
all
he
had
never
seen
the
lovely
old
domain
he
had
acquired
only
by
descriptions
of
it
as
she
led
him
so
often
across
the
woods
down
by
the
babbling
burn
or
over
the
great
ruins
did
he
know
and
love
it
every
shepherd
of
the
ochils
knows
of
the
lady
of
glencardine
who
on
rare
occasions
had
been
seen
dressed
in
green
flitting
before
the
modern
mansion
and
who
was
said
to
be
the
spectre
of
the
young
lady
jane
glencardine
who
in
was
foully
drowned
in
the
earn
by
her
jealous
lover
the
lord
of
glamis
and
whose
body
was
never
recovered
her
appearance
always
boded
to
the
family
in
residence
glencardine
was
scarcely
ever
without
guests
lady
heyburn
a
shallow
and
vain
woman
many
years
younger
than
her
husband
was
always
surrounded
by
her
own
friends
she
hated
the
country
and
more
especially
what
she
declared
to
be
the
deadly
dullness
of
her
perthshire
home
that
moment
was
no
exception
there
were
guests
staying
in
the
house
but
neither
gabrielle
nor
her
father
took
the
slightest
interest
in
any
of
them
they
had
been
of
course
invited
to
the
ball
at
connachan
and
at
dinner
had
expressed
surprise
when
their
host
pretty
daughter
the
belle
of
the
county
had
declared
that
she
was
not
going
oh
gabrielle
is
really
such
a
wayward
child
declared
her
ladyship
to
old
colonel
burton
at
her
side
if
she
has
decided
not
to
go
no
power
on
earth
will
persuade
her
i
not
feeling
at
all
well
mother
the
girl
responded
from
the
farther
end
of
the
table
you
make
nice
excuses
for
me
wo
you
i
think
it
simply
ridiculous
declared
the
baronet
wife
your
first
season
too
gabrielle
glanced
round
the
table
coloured
slightly
but
said
nothing
the
guests
knew
too
well
that
in
the
glencardine
household
there
had
always
been
and
always
would
be
slightly
strained
relations
between
her
ladyship
and
her
stepdaughter
for
an
hour
after
dinner
all
was
bustle
and
excitement
then
in
the
covered
wagonette
the
gay
party
drove
away
while
gabrielle
standing
at
the
door
shouted
after
them
a
merry
adieu
it
was
a
bright
clear
moonlit
night
so
beautiful
indeed
that
twisting
a
shawl
about
her
shoulders
she
went
to
her
father
den
where
he
usually
smoked
alone
and
taking
his
arm
led
him
out
for
a
walk
into
the
park
over
that
gravelled
drive
where
upon
such
nights
as
that
was
said
that
the
unfortunate
lady
jane
could
be
seen
when
alone
the
sightless
man
could
find
his
way
quite
well
with
the
aid
of
his
stick
he
knew
every
inch
of
his
domain
indeed
he
could
descend
from
the
castle
by
the
winding
path
that
led
deep
into
the
glen
and
across
the
narrow
of
the
rushing
ruthven
water
or
he
could
traverse
the
most
intricate
paths
through
the
woods
by
means
of
certain
landmarks
which
only
he
himself
knew
he
was
ever
fond
of
wandering
about
the
estate
alone
and
often
took
solitary
walks
on
bright
nights
with
his
stout
stick
tapping
before
him
on
rare
occasions
however
when
in
the
absence
of
her
ladyship
he
enjoyed
the
company
of
pretty
gabrielle
they
would
wander
in
the
park
chatting
and
exchanging
confidences
the
departure
of
their
had
lifted
a
heavy
weight
from
both
their
hearts
it
would
be
dawn
before
they
returned
she
loved
her
father
and
was
never
happier
than
when
describing
to
him
things
the
smallest
objects
sometimes
which
he
himself
could
not
see
as
they
strolled
on
beneath
the
shadows
of
the
tall
elms
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
broken
only
by
the
quick
scurry
of
a
rabbit
into
the
tall
bracken
or
the
harsh
cry
of
some
startled
by
their
approach
before
them
standing
black
against
the
rose
the
quaint
ponderous
but
broken
walls
of
the
ancient
stronghold
where
an
owl
hooted
weirdly
in
the
ivy
and
where
the
whispering
of
the
waters
rose
from
the
deep
below
it
a
pity
dear
that
you
did
go
to
the
dance
the
old
man
was
saying
her
arm
held
within
his
own
you
annoyed
your
mother
i
fear
mother
is
quite
happy
with
her
guests
dad
while
i
am
quite
happy
with
you
she
replied
softly
therefore
why
discuss
it
but
surely
it
is
not
very
entertaining
for
you
to
remain
here
with
a
man
who
is
blind
remember
you
are
young
and
these
golden
days
of
youth
will
very
soon
pass
why
you
always
entertain
and
instruct
me
dad
she
declared
from
you
i
learnt
so
much
archaeology
and
so
much
about
mediaeval
seals
that
i
believe
i
am
qualified
to
become
a
fellow
of
the
society
of
antiquaries
if
women
were
admitted
to
fellowship
they
will
be
one
day
my
dear
if
the
suffragettes
are
allowed
their
own
way
he
laughed
and
then
during
the
full
hour
they
strolled
together
their
conversation
mostly
consisted
of
questions
asked
by
her
father
concerning
some
improvements
being
made
in
one
of
the
farms
which
she
had
visited
on
the
previous
day
and
her
description
of
what
had
been
done
the
had
struck
ten
on
its
musical
chimes
before
they
the
big
hall
and
being
relieved
by
hill
of
the
wraps
passed
together
into
the
library
where
from
a
locked
cabinet
in
a
corner
gabrielle
took
a
number
of
business
papers
and
placed
them
upon
the
before
her
father
no
he
said
running
his
thin
white
hands
over
them
not
business
dear
but
pleasure
where
is
that
box
from
the
professor
it
here
dad
shall
i
open
it
yes
he
replied
that
dear
old
fellow
never
forgets
his
old
friend
never
a
seal
finds
its
way
into
the
collection
at
cambridge
but
he
first
sends
it
to
me
for
examination
before
it
is
catalogued
he
knows
what
pleasure
it
is
to
me
to
decipher
them
and
make
out
their
history
almost
alas
the
only
pleasure
left
to
me
except
you
my
darling
professor
moyes
adopts
your
opinion
always
dad
he
knows
as
every
other
antiquary
knows
that
you
are
the
greatest
living
authority
on
the
subject
which
you
have
made
a
lifetime
study
that
of
the
bronze
seals
of
the
middle
ages
ah
sighed
the
old
man
if
i
could
only
write
my
great
book
it
is
the
pleasure
debarred
me
years
ago
i
started
to
collect
material
but
my
affliction
came
and
now
i
can
only
feel
the
matrices
and
picture
them
in
my
mind
i
see
through
your
eyes
dear
gabrielle
to
me
the
world
i
loved
so
much
is
only
a
blank
darkness
with
your
dear
voice
sounding
out
of
it
the
only
voice
my
child
that
is
music
to
my
ears
the
girl
said
nothing
she
only
glanced
at
the
sad
expressionless
face
and
cutting
the
string
of
the
small
packet
displayed
three
bronze
seals
two
oval
about
two
inches
long
and
the
third
round
about
one
inch
in
diameter
and
each
with
a
small
kind
of
handle
on
the
reverse
with
them
were
or
impressions
taken
from
them
ready
to
be
placed
in
the
museum
at
cambridge
the
old
man
nervous
fingers
travelled
over
the
surfaces
quickly
an
expression
of
complete
satisfaction
in
his
face
have
you
the
dear
tell
me
what
you
make
of
the
inscriptions
he
said
at
the
same
time
carefully
feeling
the
curious
mediaeval
lettering
of
one
of
the
casts
at
the
same
instant
she
started
rose
quickly
from
her
chair
and
held
her
breath
a
man
tall
and
wearing
a
thin
black
overcoat
had
entered
noiselessly
from
the
lawn
by
the
open
window
and
stood
there
with
his
finger
upon
his
lips
indicating
silence
then
he
pointed
outside
with
a
commanding
gesture
that
she
should
follow
her
eyes
met
his
in
a
glance
of
fierce
resentment
and
instinctively
she
placed
her
hand
upon
her
breast
as
though
to
stay
the
beating
of
her
heart
again
he
pointed
in
silent
authority
and
she
as
though
held
in
some
mysterious
thraldom
made
excuse
to
the
blind
man
and
rising
followed
in
his
noiseless
footsteps
chapter
iii
seals
of
destiny
ten
minutes
later
she
returned
panting
her
face
pale
and
haggard
her
mouth
for
a
moment
she
stood
in
silence
upon
the
threshold
of
the
open
doors
leading
to
the
grounds
her
hand
pressed
to
her
breast
in
a
strenuous
endeavour
to
calm
herself
she
feared
that
her
father
might
detect
her
agitation
for
he
was
so
quick
in
discovering
in
her
the
slightest
unusual
emotion
she
glanced
behind
her
with
an
expression
full
of
fear
as
though
dreading
the
reappearance
of
that
man
who
had
compelled
her
to
follow
him
out
into
the
night
then
she
looked
at
her
father
who
still
seated
motionless
with
his
back
to
her
was
busy
with
his
fingers
upon
something
on
the
before
him
in
that
brief
absence
her
countenance
had
entirely
changed
she
was
pale
to
the
lips
with
drawn
brows
while
about
her
mouth
played
a
hard
bitter
expression
as
though
her
mind
were
bent
upon
some
desperate
resolve
that
the
man
who
had
come
there
by
stealth
was
no
stranger
was
evident
yet
that
between
them
was
some
enmity
was
equally
apparent
nevertheless
he
held
her
irresistibly
within
his
toils
his
face
was
a
distinctly
evil
one
his
eyes
were
set
too
close
together
and
in
his
physiognomy
was
something
unscrupulous
and
relentless
he
was
not
the
man
for
a
woman
to
trust
she
stepped
back
from
the
threshold
and
for
a
few
seconds
halted
outside
her
ears
strained
to
catch
any
sound
then
as
though
reassured
she
pushed
the
chestnut
hair
from
her
hot
fevered
brow
held
her
breath
with
strenuous
effort
and
the
library
advanced
to
her
father
side
i
wondered
where
you
had
gone
dear
he
said
in
his
low
calm
voice
as
he
detected
her
presence
i
hoped
you
would
not
leave
me
for
long
for
it
is
not
very
often
we
enjoy
an
evening
so
entirely
alone
as
leave
you
dear
old
dad
why
of
course
not
she
laughed
gaily
as
though
nothing
had
occurred
to
disturb
her
peace
of
mind
we
were
just
about
to
look
at
those
seals
professor
moyes
sent
you
we
here
they
are
and
she
placed
them
before
the
helpless
and
afflicted
man
endeavouring
to
remain
undisturbed
and
taking
a
chair
at
his
side
as
was
her
habit
when
they
sat
together
yes
he
said
cheerfully
let
us
see
what
they
are
the
first
of
the
yellow
which
he
examined
bore
the
figure
of
an
abbot
with
mitre
and
crosier
in
the
act
of
giving
his
blessing
behind
him
were
three
circular
towers
with
pointed
roofs
surmounted
by
crosses
while
around
in
bold
early
gothic
letters
ran
the
inscription
benediti
abbatis
santi
ambrosii
slowly
and
with
great
care
his
fingers
travelled
over
the
raised
letters
and
design
of
the
oval
cast
then
having
also
examined
the
battered
old
bronze
matrix
he
said
a
most
excellent
specimen
and
in
preservation
too
i
wonder
where
it
has
been
found
in
italy
without
doubt
what
do
you
make
it
out
to
be
dad
asked
the
girl
seated
in
the
chair
at
his
side
and
as
interested
in
the
little
antiquity
as
he
was
himself
thirteenth
century
my
dear
early
thirteenth
century
he
declared
without
hesitation
genuine
quite
genuine
no
doubt
the
matrix
shows
signs
of
considerable
wear
is
there
much
patina
upon
it
he
asked
she
turned
it
over
displaying
that
thick
green
corrosion
which
bronze
acquires
only
by
great
age
yes
quite
a
lot
dad
the
raised
portion
at
the
back
is
pierced
by
a
hole
very
much
worn
worn
by
the
thong
by
which
it
was
attached
to
the
girdle
of
successive
abbots
through
centuries
he
declared
from
its
inscription
it
is
the
seal
of
the
abbot
benedict
of
the
monastery
of
ambrose
of
rancia
in
lombardy
let
me
think
now
we
should
find
the
history
of
that
house
probably
in
sassolini
will
you
get
it
down
dear
top
shelf
of
the
fifth
case
on
the
left
though
blind
he
knew
just
where
he
could
put
his
hand
upon
all
his
most
cherished
volumes
and
woe
betide
any
one
who
put
a
volume
back
in
its
wrong
place
gabrielle
rose
and
obtaining
the
steps
reached
down
the
great
quarto
book
which
she
carried
to
a
and
at
once
searched
the
index
the
work
was
in
italian
a
language
which
she
knew
fairly
well
and
after
ten
minutes
or
so
during
which
time
the
blind
man
continued
slowly
to
trace
the
inscription
with
his
she
said
here
it
is
dad
near
cremona
the
religious
brotherhood
was
founded
there
in
and
the
abbot
benedict
was
third
abbot
from
to
the
church
still
exists
the
magnificent
pulpit
in
marble
embellished
with
mosaics
presented
in
rests
on
six
columns
supported
by
lions
with
an
inscription
de
montava
marmorarius
hoc
opus
opposite
it
is
the
ambo
in
a
simple
style
with
a
representation
of
jonah
being
swallowed
by
a
whale
in
the
choir
is
the
throne
adorned
by
mosaics
and
the
cappella
di
san
pantaleone
contains
the
blood
of
the
saint
together
with
some
relics
of
the
abbot
benedict
the
cloisters
still
exist
though
of
course
the
monastery
is
now
suppressed
and
this
remarked
sir
henry
turning
over
the
old
bronze
seal
in
his
hand
belonged
to
the
abbot
ambrose
six
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
yes
dad
declared
the
girl
returning
to
his
side
and
taking
the
matrix
herself
to
examine
it
under
the
the
study
of
seals
is
most
interesting
it
carries
one
back
into
the
dim
ages
i
hope
the
professor
will
allow
you
to
keep
these
casts
for
your
collection
yes
i
know
he
will
responded
the
old
baronet
he
is
well
aware
what
a
deep
interest
i
take
in
my
hobby
and
also
that
you
are
one
of
the
first
authorities
in
the
world
upon
the
subject
added
his
daughter
the
old
man
sighed
would
that
he
could
see
with
his
eyes
once
again
for
after
all
the
sense
of
touch
was
but
a
poor
substitute
for
that
of
sight
he
drew
towards
him
the
impression
of
the
second
of
the
oval
seals
the
centre
was
divided
into
two
portions
above
was
the
figure
of
a
saint
holding
a
closed
book
in
his
hand
and
below
was
a
youth
with
long
hands
in
the
act
of
adoration
between
them
was
a
scroll
upon
which
was
written
sc
martine
while
around
the
seal
were
the
words
in
gothic
characters
sigil
heinrichi
plebani
d
this
is
fourteenth
century
pronounced
the
baronet
and
is
from
dulcigno
on
the
adriatic
the
seal
of
henry
the
vicar
of
the
church
of
that
place
from
the
engraving
and
style
he
said
still
fingering
it
with
great
care
now
and
then
turning
to
the
matrix
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
i
should
place
it
as
having
been
executed
about
but
it
is
really
a
very
beautiful
specimen
done
at
a
time
when
the
art
of
was
at
its
height
no
engraver
could
turn
out
a
more
ornate
and
at
the
same
time
bold
design
moyes
is
really
very
fortunate
in
securing
this
you
must
write
my
dear
and
ask
him
how
these
latest
treasures
came
into
his
hands
at
his
request
she
got
down
another
of
the
ponderous
volumes
of
sassolini
from
the
high
shelf
and
read
to
him
translating
from
the
italian
the
brief
notice
of
the
ancient
church
of
dulcigno
which
it
appeared
had
been
built
in
the
style
of
the
eleventh
century
while
the
campanile
with
columns
from
paestum
dated
from
the
third
seal
the
circular
one
was
larger
than
the
rest
being
quite
two
inches
across
in
the
centre
of
the
top
half
was
the
madonna
with
child
seated
a
male
and
female
figure
on
either
side
below
were
three
female
figures
on
either
side
the
two
scenes
being
divided
by
a
festoon
of
flowers
while
around
the
edge
ran
in
somewhat
more
modern
characters
those
of
the
early
sixteenth
century
the
following
sigillvm
vicaris
generalis
ordinis
beata
maria
d
mon
carmel
this
declared
sir
henry
after
a
long
and
most
minute
examination
is
a
treasure
probably
unequalled
in
the
collection
at
cambridge
being
the
actual
seal
of
the
of
the
carmelite
order
its
date
i
should
place
at
about
look
well
dear
at
those
flower
garlands
how
beautifully
they
are
engraved
is
alas
a
lost
art
we
have
only
crude
and
heavy
attempts
the
company
seal
seems
the
only
thing
the
engraver
can
turn
out
those
machines
which
emboss
upon
a
big
red
wafer
and
his
busy
fingers
were
continuously
feeling
the
great
circular
bronze
matrix
and
a
moment
afterwards
its
he
was
an
enthusiastic
antiquary
and
long
ago
in
the
days
when
the
world
was
light
had
read
papers
before
the
society
of
antiquaries
at
burlington
house
upon
mediaeval
seals
and
upon
the
early
latin
codices
nowadays
however
gabrielle
acted
as
his
eyes
and
so
devoted
was
she
to
her
father
that
she
took
a
keen
interest
in
his
hobbies
so
that
after
his
long
tuition
she
could
decipher
and
read
a
latin
manuscript
on
its
scrap
of
yellow
crinkled
parchment
and
with
all
its
puzzling
abbreviations
almost
as
well
as
any
professor
of
palaeography
at
the
universities
while
inscriptions
upon
gothic
seals
were
to
her
as
plain
as
a
paragraph
in
a
newspaper
more
than
once
spectacled
professors
who
came
to
glencardine
as
her
father
guests
were
amazed
at
her
intelligent
conversation
upon
points
which
were
quite
abstruse
indeed
she
had
no
idea
of
the
remarkable
extent
of
her
own
antiquarian
knowledge
all
of
it
gathered
from
the
talented
man
whose
affliction
had
kept
her
so
close
at
his
side
for
quite
an
hour
her
father
fingered
the
three
discussing
them
with
her
in
the
language
of
a
savant
she
herself
examined
them
minutely
and
expressed
opinions
now
and
then
she
glanced
apprehensively
to
that
open
window
he
pointed
out
to
her
where
she
was
wrong
in
her
estimate
of
the
design
of
the
circular
one
explaining
a
technical
and
detail
concerning
the
seals
of
the
carmelite
order
from
the
window
a
cool
breath
of
the
came
in
fanning
the
curtains
and
carrying
with
it
the
sweet
scent
of
the
flowers
without
how
refreshing
exclaimed
the
old
man
drawing
in
a
deep
breath
the
night
is
very
close
gabrielle
dear
i
fear
we
shall
have
thunder
there
was
lightning
only
a
moment
ago
explained
the
girl
shall
i
put
the
casts
into
your
collection
dad
yes
dear
moyes
no
doubt
intends
that
i
should
keep
them
gabrielle
rose
and
passing
across
to
a
large
cabinet
with
many
shallow
drawers
she
opened
one
displaying
a
tray
full
of
casts
of
seals
each
neatly
arranged
with
its
inscription
and
translation
placed
beneath
all
in
her
own
clear
handwriting
some
of
the
drawers
contained
the
matrices
as
well
as
the
casts
but
as
matrices
of
mediaeval
seals
are
rarities
and
seldom
found
anywhere
save
in
the
chief
public
museums
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
bulk
of
private
collections
consist
of
impressions
presently
at
the
baronet
suggestion
she
closed
and
locked
the
cabinet
and
then
took
up
a
bundle
of
business
documents
which
she
commenced
to
sort
out
and
arrange
she
acted
as
her
father
private
secretary
and
therefore
knew
much
of
his
affairs
but
many
things
were
to
her
a
complete
mystery
be
it
said
though
devoted
to
her
father
she
nevertheless
sometimes
became
filled
with
a
vague
suspicion
that
the
source
of
his
great
income
was
not
altogether
an
open
and
honest
one
the
papers
and
letters
she
read
to
him
often
contained
veiled
information
which
sorely
puzzled
her
and
which
caused
her
many
hours
of
wonder
and
reflection
her
father
lived
alone
with
only
her
as
companion
her
stepmother
a
young
and
giddy
woman
never
dreamed
the
truth
what
would
she
do
how
would
she
act
gabrielle
wondered
if
ever
she
gained
sight
of
some
of
those
private
papers
kept
locked
in
the
cavity
beyond
the
black
steel
door
concealed
by
the
false
bookcase
at
the
farther
end
of
the
fine
old
restful
room
the
papers
she
handled
had
been
taken
from
the
safe
by
sir
henry
himself
and
they
contained
a
man
secret
chapter
iv
something
concerning
james
flockart
in
the
spreading
dawn
the
house
party
had
returned
from
connachan
and
had
ascended
to
their
rooms
weary
with
the
night
revelry
the
men
with
crumpled
and
ties
awry
the
women
with
hair
disordered
and
in
some
cases
with
flimsy
skirts
torn
in
the
mazes
of
the
dance
yet
all
were
merry
and
full
of
satisfaction
at
what
one
young
man
from
town
had
declared
to
be
an
awfully
ripping
evening
all
retired
at
once
all
save
the
hostess
and
one
of
her
male
guests
the
man
who
had
entered
the
library
by
stealth
earlier
in
the
evening
and
had
called
gabrielle
outside
lady
heyburn
and
her
visitor
james
flockart
had
managed
to
slip
away
from
the
others
and
now
stood
together
in
the
library
into
which
the
grey
light
of
dawn
was
at
that
moment
slowly
creeping
he
drew
up
one
of
the
blinds
to
admit
the
light
and
there
away
over
the
hills
beyond
the
glen
showed
the
red
flush
that
heralded
the
coming
then
returning
to
where
stood
the
young
and
attractive
woman
in
pale
pink
chiffon
with
diamonds
on
her
neck
and
a
star
in
her
fair
hair
he
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
and
asked
well
and
what
have
you
decided
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
but
made
no
reply
she
was
hesitating
the
gems
upon
her
were
heirlooms
of
the
heyburn
family
and
in
that
grey
light
looked
cold
and
glassy
the
powder
and
the
slight
touch
of
carmine
upon
her
cheeks
which
at
night
had
served
to
heighten
her
beauty
now
gave
her
an
appearance
of
painted
artificiality
she
was
undeniably
a
pretty
woman
and
surely
required
no
artificial
aids
to
beauty
about
yet
she
looked
five
years
younger
while
her
husband
was
twenty
years
senior
to
herself
she
still
retained
a
figure
so
girlish
that
most
people
took
her
for
gabrielle
elder
sister
while
in
the
matter
of
dress
she
was
admitted
in
society
to
be
one
of
the
leaders
of
fashion
her
hair
was
of
that
rare
tint
her
features
regular
with
a
slightly
protruding
chin
soft
eyes
and
cheeks
perfect
in
their
contour
society
knew
her
as
a
gay
reckless
giddy
woman
who
regardless
of
the
terrible
affliction
which
had
fallen
upon
the
brilliant
man
who
was
her
husband
surrounded
herself
with
a
circle
of
friends
of
the
same
type
as
herself
and
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
her
life
regardless
of
any
gossip
or
of
the
malignant
statements
by
women
who
envied
her
men
were
fond
of
winnie
heyburn
as
they
called
her
and
always
voted
her
good
fun
they
pitied
poor
sir
henry
but
after
all
he
was
blind
and
preferred
his
hobbies
of
collecting
old
seals
and
dusty
parchment
manuscripts
to
dances
theatres
aero
shows
at
ranelagh
and
suppers
at
the
carlton
or
savoy
like
most
wealthy
women
of
her
type
she
had
a
wide
circle
of
male
friends
younger
men
declared
her
to
be
a
real
pal
and
with
some
of
the
older
beaux
she
would
flirt
and
be
amused
by
their
flattering
speeches
gabrielle
mother
the
second
daughter
of
lord
buckhurst
had
been
dead
several
years
when
the
brilliant
politician
met
his
second
wife
at
a
at
dollis
hill
she
was
daughter
of
a
man
named
lambert
a
paper
manufacturer
who
acted
as
political
agent
in
the
town
of
bedford
and
she
was
therefore
essentially
a
country
cousin
her
beauty
was
however
remarked
everywhere
the
baronet
was
struck
by
her
and
within
three
months
they
were
married
at
george
hanover
square
the
world
congratulating
her
upon
a
very
excellent
match
from
the
very
first
however
the
difference
in
the
ages
of
husband
and
wife
proved
a
barrier
ere
the
honeymoon
was
over
she
found
that
her
husband
tied
by
his
political
engagements
and
by
his
eternal
duties
at
the
house
was
unable
to
accompany
her
out
of
an
evening
hence
from
the
very
first
they
had
drifted
apart
until
eight
months
later
the
terrible
affliction
of
blindness
fell
upon
him
for
a
time
this
drew
her
back
to
him
she
was
his
constant
and
dutiful
companion
everywhere
leading
him
hither
and
thither
and
attending
to
his
wants
but
very
soon
the
tie
bored
her
and
the
attractions
of
society
once
again
proved
too
great
hence
for
the
past
nine
years
gabrielle
being
at
school
first
at
eastbourne
and
afterwards
at
amiens
she
had
amused
herself
and
left
her
husband
to
his
hobbies
and
the
loneliness
of
his
black
and
sunless
world
the
man
who
had
just
put
that
curious
question
to
her
was
perhaps
her
closest
friend
to
her
he
owed
everything
though
the
world
was
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
they
were
friends
everybody
knew
indeed
they
had
been
friends
years
ago
in
bedford
before
her
marriage
for
james
was
the
only
son
of
the
reverend
henry
flockart
vicar
of
one
of
the
parishes
in
the
town
people
living
in
bedford
recollected
that
the
parson
son
had
turned
out
rather
badly
and
had
gone
to
america
but
a
year
or
two
after
that
the
old
clergyman
had
died
the
living
had
been
given
to
a
successor
and
bedford
knew
the
name
of
flockart
no
more
after
winifred
marriage
however
london
society
or
rather
a
gay
section
of
it
became
acquainted
with
james
flockart
who
lived
at
ease
in
his
pretty
in
street
and
who
soon
gathered
about
him
a
large
circle
of
male
acquaintances
sir
henry
knew
him
and
raised
no
objection
to
his
wife
friendship
towards
him
they
had
been
boy
and
girl
together
therefore
what
more
natural
than
that
they
should
be
friends
in
later
life
in
her
schooldays
gabrielle
knew
practically
nothing
of
this
man
but
now
she
had
returned
to
be
her
father
companion
she
had
met
him
and
had
bitter
cause
to
hate
both
him
and
lady
heyburn
it
was
her
own
secret
she
kept
it
to
herself
she
hid
the
truth
from
her
father
from
every
one
she
watched
closely
and
in
patience
one
day
she
would
speak
and
tell
the
truth
until
then
she
resolved
to
keep
to
herself
all
that
she
knew
well
asked
the
man
with
the
and
white
waistcoat
smeared
with
what
have
you
decided
he
asked
again
i
decided
nothing
was
her
blank
answer
but
you
must
do
be
a
silly
fool
he
urged
you
surely
had
time
to
think
over
it
no
i
have
the
girl
knows
nothing
so
what
have
you
to
fear
he
endeavoured
to
assure
her
lady
heyburn
shrugged
her
shoulders
how
can
you
prove
that
she
knows
nothing
oh
she
has
eyes
for
nobody
but
the
old
man
he
laughed
is
an
example
why
she
would
come
to
connachan
even
though
she
knew
that
walter
was
there
she
preferred
to
spend
the
evening
here
with
her
father
she
a
little
fool
of
course
jimmy
replied
the
woman
in
pink
but
perhaps
it
was
as
well
that
she
did
come
i
hate
to
have
to
chaperon
the
chit
it
makes
me
look
so
horribly
old
i
wish
to
goodness
the
girl
was
out
of
the
way
he
declared
sharper
than
we
think
and
by
jove
if
ever
she
did
know
what
was
in
progress
it
would
be
all
up
for
both
of
us
would
it
phew
think
of
it
if
i
thought
she
had
the
slightest
suspicion
declared
her
ladyship
with
a
sudden
hardness
of
her
lips
i
i
close
her
mouth
very
quickly
and
for
ever
eh
he
asked
meaningly
yes
for
ever
bah
he
laughed
you
be
afraid
to
do
that
my
dear
winnie
added
the
man
lowering
his
voice
your
husband
is
blind
it
true
but
there
are
other
people
in
the
world
who
are
not
recollect
gabrielle
is
now
nineteen
and
she
has
her
eyes
open
she
the
eyes
and
ears
of
sir
henry
not
the
slightest
thing
occurs
in
this
household
but
it
is
told
to
him
at
once
his
indifference
to
all
is
only
a
clever
pretence
what
she
gasped
quickly
do
you
think
he
suspects
pray
what
can
he
suspect
asked
the
man
very
calmly
both
hands
in
his
as
he
leaned
back
against
the
table
in
front
of
her
he
can
only
suspect
things
which
his
daughter
knows
she
said
but
what
does
she
know
what
can
she
know
he
asked
how
can
we
tell
i
have
watched
but
can
detect
nothing
i
am
however
suspicious
because
she
did
not
come
to
connachan
with
us
why
walter
murie
may
know
something
and
may
have
told
her
if
so
then
to
close
her
lips
would
be
useless
it
would
only
bring
a
heavier
responsibility
upon
us
and
but
he
hesitated
without
finishing
his
sentence
his
meaning
was
apparent
from
the
wry
face
she
pulled
at
his
remark
he
did
not
tell
her
how
he
had
while
she
had
been
dancing
and
flirting
that
night
made
his
way
back
to
the
castle
or
how
he
had
compelled
gabrielle
to
go
forth
and
speak
with
him
his
action
had
been
a
bold
one
yet
its
result
had
confirmed
certain
vague
suspicions
he
had
held
well
he
knew
that
the
girl
hated
him
heartily
and
that
she
was
in
possession
of
a
certain
secret
of
his
one
which
might
easily
result
in
his
downfall
he
feared
to
tell
the
truth
to
this
woman
before
him
for
if
he
did
so
she
would
certainly
withdraw
from
all
association
with
him
in
order
to
save
herself
the
key
to
the
whole
situation
was
held
by
that
slim
girl
so
devoted
to
her
afflicted
father
he
was
not
quite
certain
as
to
the
actual
extent
of
her
knowledge
and
was
as
yet
undecided
as
to
what
attitude
he
should
adopt
towards
her
he
stood
between
the
wife
and
his
daughter
and
hesitated
in
which
direction
to
follow
what
did
she
really
know
he
wondered
had
she
overheard
any
of
that
serious
conversation
between
lady
heyburn
and
himself
while
they
walked
together
in
the
glen
on
the
previous
evening
such
a
was
surely
impossible
for
he
remembered
they
had
taken
every
precaution
lest
even
stewart
the
head
gamekeeper
might
be
about
in
order
to
stop
trespassers
who
attracted
by
the
beauties
of
glencardine
tried
to
penetrate
and
explore
them
and
by
so
doing
disturbed
the
game
and
if
the
girl
really
knows
he
asked
of
the
woman
who
stood
there
motionless
gazing
out
across
the
lawn
fixedly
towards
the
dawn
if
she
knows
james
she
said
in
a
hard
decisive
tone
then
we
must
act
together
quickly
and
fearlessly
we
must
carry
out
that
that
plan
you
proposed
a
year
ago
you
are
quite
fearless
then
he
asked
looking
straight
into
her
fine
eyes
fearless
of
course
i
am
she
answered
unflinchingly
we
must
get
rid
of
her
providing
we
can
do
so
without
any
suspicion
falling
upon
us
you
seem
to
have
become
quite
she
exclaimed
to
him
with
a
harsh
derisive
laugh
you
were
not
so
a
year
ago
in
the
other
affair
his
brows
contracted
as
he
reflected
upon
all
it
meant
to
him
the
girl
knew
something
therefore
to
seal
her
lips
was
imperative
for
their
own
safety
she
was
their
enemy
you
are
mistaken
he
answered
in
a
low
calm
voice
i
am
just
as
determined
just
as
fearless
as
i
was
then
and
you
will
do
it
she
asked
if
it
is
your
wish
he
replied
simply
good
give
me
your
hand
we
are
agreed
it
shall
be
done
and
the
man
took
the
slim
white
hand
the
woman
held
out
to
him
and
a
moment
later
they
ascended
the
great
oak
staircase
to
their
respective
rooms
the
pair
were
in
accord
the
future
contained
for
gabrielle
heyburn
asleep
and
all
unconscious
of
the
dastardly
conspiracy
only
that
which
must
be
hideous
tragic
fatal
chapter
v
the
muries
of
connachan
elise
lady
heyburn
french
maid
discovered
next
morning
that
an
antique
was
missing
a
loss
which
occasioned
great
consternation
in
the
household
breakfast
was
late
and
at
table
when
the
loss
was
mentioned
gabrielle
offered
to
drive
over
to
connachan
in
the
car
and
make
inquiry
and
search
the
general
opinion
was
that
it
had
been
dropped
in
one
of
the
rooms
and
was
probably
still
lying
there
undiscovered
the
girl
offer
was
accepted
and
half
an
hour
later
the
smaller
of
the
two
glencardine
cars
the
sixteen
fiat
was
brought
round
to
the
door
by
stokes
the
smart
chauffeur
young
gellatly
fresh
down
from
oxford
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
with
her
and
his
escort
was
accepted
then
in
and
gabrielle
mounted
at
the
wheel
with
the
young
fellow
at
her
side
and
stokes
in
the
back
and
drove
away
down
the
long
avenue
to
the
the
car
was
her
delight
never
so
happy
was
she
as
when
wrapped
in
her
she
drove
the
sixteen
the
sixty
was
too
powerful
for
her
but
with
the
sixteen
she
ran
scotland
and
was
quite
a
common
object
on
the
perth
to
stirling
road
possessed
of
nerve
and
full
of
she
could
negotiate
traffic
in
edinburgh
or
glasgow
and
on
one
occasion
had
driven
her
father
the
whole
way
from
glencardine
up
to
london
a
distance
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
miles
her
fingers
pressed
the
button
of
the
electric
horn
as
they
descended
the
sharp
incline
to
the
and
turning
into
the
open
road
she
was
soon
speeding
along
through
auchterarder
village
skirted
tullibardine
wood
down
through
braco
and
along
by
the
knaik
water
and
patrick
well
into
glen
artney
passing
under
the
dark
shadow
of
dundurn
until
there
came
into
view
the
broad
waters
of
loch
earn
the
morning
was
bright
and
cloudless
and
at
such
a
pace
they
went
that
a
perfect
wall
of
dust
stood
behind
them
from
the
margin
of
the
loch
the
ground
rose
for
a
couple
of
miles
until
it
reached
a
plateau
upon
which
stood
the
fine
imposing
priory
the
ancestral
seat
of
the
muries
of
connachan
the
aspect
as
they
drove
up
was
very
imposing
the
winding
road
was
closely
planted
with
trees
for
a
large
portion
of
its
course
and
the
stately
front
of
the
western
entrance
with
its
massive
stone
portico
and
crenulated
cornice
burst
unexpectedly
upon
them
from
that
point
of
view
one
seemed
to
have
reached
the
of
a
princely
edifice
crowned
with
gothic
belfries
yet
on
looking
round
it
was
seen
that
the
approach
by
which
the
doorway
had
been
reached
was
lined
on
one
side
with
buildings
hidden
behind
the
clustering
foliage
and
through
the
archway
on
the
left
one
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
and
spacious
and
garage
extending
northwards
for
a
considerable
distance
gabrielle
ran
the
car
round
to
the
south
side
of
the
house
where
in
the
foreground
were
the
parks
of
connachan
the
lawn
fringed
with
symmetrically
planted
trees
and
the
fertile
fields
extending
away
to
the
very
brink
of
the
loch
the
original
fortalice
of
the
muries
half
a
mile
distant
was
like
glencardine
a
ruin
the
present
priory
notwithstanding
its
towers
and
lancet
windows
was
a
comparatively
modern
structure
and
the
ivy
which
partially
covered
some
of
the
windows
could
claim
no
great
antiquity
yet
the
general
effect
of
the
architectural
grouping
was
most
pleasing
and
might
well
deceive
the
visitor
or
tourist
into
the
supposition
that
it
belonged
to
a
very
remote
period
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
work
of
atkinson
who
in
the
first
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
built
scone
abbotsford
and
taymouth
castle
with
loud
warning
blasts
upon
the
horn
gabrielle
heyburn
pulled
up
but
ere
she
could
descend
walter
murie
a
young
man
in
grey
flannels
and
hatless
was
outside
hailing
her
with
delight
hallo
gabrielle
he
cried
cheerily
taking
her
hand
what
brings
you
over
this
morning
especially
when
we
were
told
last
night
that
you
were
so
very
ill
the
illness
has
passed
exclaimed
young
gellatly
shaking
his
hand
and
we
now
in
search
of
a
lost
bracelet
one
of
lady
heyburn
why
my
mother
was
just
going
to
wire
one
of
the
maids
found
it
in
the
boudoir
this
morning
but
we
did
know
to
whom
it
belonged
come
inside
there
are
a
lot
of
people
staying
over
from
last
night
then
turning
to
gabrielle
he
added
by
jove
what
dust
there
must
be
on
the
road
you
absolutely
covered
well
she
laughed
lightly
it
wo
hurt
me
i
suppose
i
not
afraid
of
it
stokes
took
charge
of
the
car
and
shut
off
the
petrol
while
the
three
went
inside
passing
into
a
long
cool
cloister
down
which
was
arranged
the
splendid
collection
of
antiques
discovered
or
acquired
by
malcolm
murie
the
antiquary
who
had
spent
many
years
in
italy
and
died
in
in
cases
ranged
down
each
side
of
the
long
cloister
with
its
antique
carved
chairs
armour
and
statuary
were
rare
etruscan
and
roman
one
containing
relics
from
the
tomb
of
a
warrior
which
included
a
adorned
with
gold
and
a
portion
of
a
golden
crown
formed
of
lilies
of
pure
gold
laid
upon
a
mould
of
bronze
another
case
was
full
of
bronze
ornaments
unearthed
near
albano
and
still
another
contained
rare
abyssinian
curios
the
collection
was
renowned
among
antiquaries
and
was
often
visited
by
sir
henry
who
would
be
brought
there
in
the
car
by
gabrielle
and
spend
hours
alone
fingering
the
objects
in
the
various
cases
sir
george
murie
and
sir
henry
heyburn
were
close
friends
therefore
it
was
but
natural
that
walter
the
heir
to
the
connachan
estate
and
gabrielle
should
often
be
thrown
into
each
other
company
or
perhaps
that
the
young
man
who
for
the
past
twelve
months
had
been
absent
on
a
tour
round
the
world
should
have
loved
her
ever
since
the
days
when
she
wore
short
skirts
and
her
hair
down
her
back
he
had
been
sorely
puzzled
why
she
had
not
at
the
last
moment
come
to
the
ball
she
had
promised
that
she
would
be
with
them
and
yet
she
had
made
the
rather
lame
excuse
of
a
headache
truth
to
tell
walter
murie
had
during
the
past
week
been
greatly
puzzled
at
her
demeanour
of
indifference
seven
days
ago
he
had
arrived
in
london
from
new
york
but
found
no
letter
from
her
awaiting
him
at
the
club
as
he
had
expected
the
last
he
had
received
in
detroit
a
month
before
and
it
was
strangely
cold
and
quite
unusual
two
days
ago
he
had
arrived
home
and
in
secret
she
had
met
him
down
at
the
end
of
the
glen
at
glencardine
at
her
wish
their
first
meeting
had
been
clandestine
why
both
their
families
knew
of
their
mutual
affection
therefore
why
should
she
now
make
a
secret
of
their
meeting
after
twelve
separation
he
was
puzzled
at
her
note
and
he
was
further
puzzled
at
her
attitude
towards
him
she
was
cold
and
unresponsive
when
he
held
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
soft
lips
she
only
once
returned
his
passionate
caress
and
then
as
though
it
were
a
duty
forced
upon
her
she
had
however
promised
to
come
to
the
ball
that
promise
she
had
deliberately
broken
though
he
could
not
understand
her
he
made
pretence
of
unconcern
he
regretted
that
she
had
not
felt
well
last
night
that
was
all
at
the
end
of
the
cloister
young
gellatly
found
one
of
lady
guests
a
girl
named
violet
priest
with
whom
he
had
danced
a
good
deal
on
the
previous
night
and
at
once
attached
himself
to
her
leaving
walter
with
the
object
of
his
affections
the
moment
they
were
alone
in
the
long
cloister
he
asked
her
quickly
tell
me
gabrielle
the
real
reason
why
you
did
not
come
last
night
i
had
looked
forward
very
much
to
seeing
you
but
i
was
disappointed
sadly
disappointed
i
am
very
sorry
she
laughed
with
assumed
nonchalance
but
i
had
to
assist
my
father
with
some
business
papers
your
mother
told
everyone
that
you
do
not
care
for
dancing
he
said
that
is
untrue
walter
i
love
dancing
i
knew
it
was
untrue
dearest
he
said
standing
before
her
but
why
does
lady
heyburn
go
out
of
her
way
to
throw
cold
water
upon
you
and
all
your
works
how
should
i
know
asked
the
girl
with
a
slight
shrug
perhaps
it
is
because
my
father
places
more
confidence
in
me
than
in
her
and
his
confidence
is
surely
not
misplaced
he
said
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
do
like
lady
heyburn
she
pretends
to
like
you
pretends
he
echoed
yes
it
all
pretence
but
he
added
do
tell
me
the
real
reason
of
your
absence
last
night
gabrielle
it
has
worried
me
why
worry
my
dear
walter
is
it
really
worth
troubling
over
i
only
a
girl
and
as
such
am
allowed
vagaries
of
nerves
and
all
that
i
simply
did
want
to
come
that
all
why
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
hate
the
crowd
we
have
staying
in
our
house
they
are
all
mother
friends
and
mother
friends
are
never
mine
you
know
he
looked
at
her
slim
figure
so
charming
in
its
daintiness
what
a
dear
little
philosopher
you
grown
to
be
in
a
single
year
he
declared
we
shall
have
you
quoting
friedrich
nietzsche
next
well
she
laughed
if
you
would
like
me
to
quote
him
i
can
do
so
i
read
secretly
at
school
one
of
the
girls
got
a
copy
from
germany
do
you
remember
what
zarathustra
says
ye
could
wear
no
better
masks
ye
men
than
your
own
faces
who
could
recognise
you
i
hope
that
not
meant
to
be
personal
he
laughed
gazing
at
the
girl
beautiful
countenance
and
great
luminous
eyes
you
may
take
it
as
you
like
she
declared
with
a
delightfully
mischievous
smile
i
only
quoted
it
to
show
you
that
i
have
read
nietzsche
and
recollect
his
many
truths
you
certainly
do
seem
to
have

gay
at
glencardine
he
remarked
changing

subject
i
noticed

flockart
there
as
usual
yes
he
one
of
mother
greatest
friends
she
makes
good
use
of
him
in
every
way
up
in
town
they
are
inseparable
it
seems
they
knew
each
other
i
believe
when
they
were
boy
and
girl
so
i
heard
replied
the
young
man
thoughtfully
leaning
against
a
big
glass
case
containing
a
collection
of
and
images
of
jupiter
hercules
mercury
used
as
household
gods
i
expected
that
he
would
be
dancing
attendance
upon
her
during
the
whole
of
the
evening
but
curiously
enough
soon
after
his
arrival
he
suddenly
disappeared
and
was
not
seen
again
until
nearly
two
then
looking
straight
in
the
girl
fathomless
eye
he
added
do
you
know
gabrielle
i
do
like
that
fellow
beware
of
him
neither
do
i
but
your
warning
is
quite
unnecessary
i
assure
you
he
does
interest
me
in
the
least
walter
murie
was
silent
for
a
moment
silent
as
though
in
doubt
a
shadow
crossed
his
features
but
only
for
a
single
second
then
he
smiled
again
upon
the
girl
whom
he
loved
so
honestly
and
so
well
the
woman
who
was
all
in
all
to
him
how
could
he
doubt
her
she
who
only
a
year
ago
had
out
yonder
in
the
park
given
him
her
pledge
of
affection
and
sealed
it
with
her
hot
passionate
kisses
remembrance
of
those
sweet
caresses
still
lingered
with
him
but
he
doubted
her
yes
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
certain
very
ugly
facts
facts
within
his
own
knowledge
yet
was
not
his
own
poignant
jealousy
misleading
him
was
not
her
refusal
to
attend
the
ball
perhaps
due
to
some
sudden
pique
or
unpleasantness
with
her
giddy
stepmother
was
it
he
only
longed
to
be
able
to
believe
that
it
might
be
so
alas
however
he
had
discovered
the
shadow
of
a
strange
and
disagreeable
truth
chapter

secret
along
the
cloister
they
went
to
the
great
hall
where
walter
mother
advanced
to
greet
her
full
of
regrets
at
the
girl
inability
to
attend
the
dance
she
handed
her
the
missing
bracelet
saying
it
is
such
a
curious
and
unusual
one
dear
that
we
wondered
to
whom
it
belonged
brown
found
it
when
she
was
sweeping
my
boudoir
this
morning
take
it
home
to
your
mother
and
suggest
that
she
has
a
stronger
clasp
put
on
it
the
girl
held
the
golden
snake
in
her
open
hand
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
seen
it
a
fine
example
of
old
italian
workmanship
it
was
made
flexible
with
its
flat
head
covered
with
diamonds
and
two
bright
emeralds
for
the
eyes
the
mouth
could
be
opened
and
within
was
a
small
cavity
where
a
photo
or
any
tiny
object
could
be
concealed
where
her
mother
had
picked
it
up
she
could
not
tell
but
lady
heyburn
was
always
purchasing
quaint
odds
and
ends
and
like
most
giddy
women
of
her
class
was
extraordinarily
fond
of
fantastic
jewellery
and
ornaments
such
as
other
women
did
not
possess
several
members
of
the
at

entered
and
chatted
all
being
full
of
the
success
of
the
previous
night
entertainment
lady
murie
husband
had
it
appeared
left
that
morning
for
edinburgh
to
attend
a
political
committee
a
little
later
walter
succeeded
in
getting
gabrielle
alone
again
in
a
small
room
leading
off
the
library
a
room
in
which
she
had
passed
many
happy
hours
with
him
before
he
had
gone
abroad
he
had
been
in
london
reading
for
the
bar
but
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
his
time
up
in
perthshire
or
at
least
all
he
possibly
could
at
such
times
they
were
inseparable
but
after
he
had
been
called
there
being
no
necessity
for
him
to
practise
he
being
heir
to
the
estates
he
had
gone
to
india
and
japan
to
broaden
his
mind
as
his
father
had
explained
i
wonder
gabrielle
he
said
hesitatingly
holding
her
hand
as
they
stood
at
the
open
window
i
wonder
if
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
put
a
question
to
you
i
i
know
i
ought
not
to
ask
it
he
stammered
but
it
is
only
because
i
love
you
so
well
dearest
that
i
ask
you
to
tell
me
the
truth
the
truth
echoed
the
girl
looking
at
him
with
some
surprise
though
turning
just
a
trifle
paler
he
thought
the
truth
about
what
about
that
man
james
flockart
was
his
low
distinct
reply
about
him
why
my
dear
walter
she
laughed
whatever
do
you
want
to
know
about
him
you
know
all
that
i
know
we
were
agreed
long
ago
that
he
is
not
a
gentleman
were
we
yes
he
said
do
you
recollect
our
talk
at
your
house
in
london
two
years
ago
soon
after
you
came
back
from
school
do
you
remember
what
you
then
told
me
she
flushed
slightly
at
the
recollection
i
i
ought
not
to
have
said
that
she
exclaimed
hurriedly
i
was
only
a
girl
then
and
i
well
i
did
know
what
you
said
has
never
passed
my
lips
dearest
only
i
ask
you
again
to
tell
me
honestly
and
frankly
whether
your
opinion
of
him
has
in
any
way
changed
i
mean
whether
you
still
believe
what
you
then
said
she
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
her
lips
twitched
nervously
and
her
eyes
stared
blankly
out
of
the
window
no
i
repeat
what
i
said
then
she
answered
in
a
strange
hoarse
voice
and
only
you
yourself
suspect
the
truth
you
are
the
only
person
to
whom
i
have
mentioned
it
and
i
have
been
filled
with
regret
ever
since
i
had
no
right
to
make
the
allegation
walter
i
should
have
kept
my
secret
to
myself
there
was
surely
no
harm
in
telling
me
dearest
he
exclaimed
still
holding
her
hand
and
looking
fixedly
into
those
fathomless
eyes
so
very
dear
to
him
you
know
too
well
that
i
would
never
betray
you
but
if
he
knew
if
that
man
ever
knew
she
cried
he
would
avenge
himself
upon
me
i
know
he
would
but
what
have
you
to
fear
little
one
he
asked
surprised
at
the
sudden
change
in
her
you
know
how
my
mother
hates
me
how
they
all
detest
me
all
except
dear
old
dad
who
is
so
terribly
helpless
misled
defrauded
and
tricked
as
he
daily
is
by
those
about
him
i
know
darling
said
the
young
man
i
know
it
all
only
too
well
trust
in
me
and
bending
he
kissed
her
softly
upon
the
lips
what
was
the
real
the
actual
truth
he
wondered
was
she
still
his
as
she
had
ever
been
or
was
she
playing
him
false
little
did
the
girl
dream
of
the
extent
of
her
lover
knowledge
of
certain
facts
which
she
was
hiding
from
the
world
vainly
believing
them
to
be
her
own
secret
little
did
she
dream
how
very
near
she
was
to
disaster
walter
murie
had
after
a
frivolous
youth
developed
at
the
age
of
into
as
sound
honest
and
upright
a
young
man
as
could
be
found
beyond
the
border
as
full
of
high
spirits
as
of
high
principles
he
was
in
every
way
worthy
the
name
of
the
gallant
family
whose
name
he
bore
a
murie
of
connachan
both
for
physical
strength
and
scrupulous
honesty
while
his
affection
for
gabrielle
heyburn
was
that
deep
devotion
which
makes
men
sacrifice
themselves
for
the
women
they
love
he
was
not
very
demonstrative
he
never
wore
his
heart
upon
his
sleeve
but
deep
within
him
was
that
true
affection
which
caused
him
to
worship
her
as
his
idol
to
him
she
was
peerless
among
women
and
her
beauty
was
unequalled
her
piquant
mischievousness
amused
him
as
a
girl
she
had
always
been
fond
of
tantalising
him
and
did
so
now
yet
he
knew
her
fine
character
how
deeply
devoted
she
was
to
her
afflicted
father
and
how
full
of
discomfort
was
her
dull
life
now
that
she
had
exchanged
her
school
for
the
same
roof
which
covered
sir
second
wife
indeed
this
latter
event
was
the
common
talk
of
all
who
knew
the
family
they
sighed
and
pitied
poor
sir
henry
it
was
all
very
sad
they
said
but
there
their
sympathy
ended
during
walter
absence
abroad
something
had
occurred
what
that
something
was
he
had
not
yet
determined
gabrielle
was
not
exactly
the
same
towards
him
as
she
used
to
be
his
keen
sensitiveness
told
him
this
instinctively
and
indeed
he
had
made
a
discovery
that
though
he
did
not
admit
it
now
had
staggered
him
he
stood
there
at
the
open
window
chatting
with
her
but
what
he
said
he
had
no
idea
his
one
thought
the
one
question
which
now
possessed
him
was
whether
she
still
loved
him
or
whether
the
discovery
he
had
made
was
the
actual
and
painful
truth
tall
and
and
essentially
he
stood
before
her
with
his
dark
eyes
fixed
upon
her
eyes
full
of
devotion
for
was
she
not
his
idol
she
was
telling
him
of
a
which
her
mother
had
arranged
for
the
following
thursday
and
pressing
him
to
attend
it
i
afraid
i
may
have
to
be
in
london
that
day
dearest
he
responded
but
if
i
may
i
come
over
and
play
tennis
will
you
be
at
home
in
the
afternoon
no
she
declared
promptly
with
a
mischievous
laugh
i
sha
i
shall
be
in
the
glen
by
the
first
bridge
at
four
and
shall
wait
for
you
there
very
well
i
be
there
he
laughed
but
why
should
we
meet
in
secret
like
this
when
everybody
knows
of
our
engagement
well
because
i
have
a
reason
she
replied
in
a
strained
voice
a
strong
reason
you
grown
suddenly
shy
afraid
of
chaff
it
seems
my
mother
is
i
fear
not
altogether
well
disposed
towards
you
walter
was
her
quick
response
dad
is
very
fond
of
you
as
you
well
know
but
lady
heyburn
has
other
views
for
me
i
think
and
is
that
the
only
reason
you
wish
to
meet
me
in
secret
he
asked
she
hesitated
became
slightly
confused
and
quickly
turned
the
conversation
into
a
different
channel
a
fact
which
caused
him
increased
doubt
and
reflection
yes
something
certainly
had
occurred
that
was
vividly
apparent
a
gulf
lay
between
them
again
he
looked
straight
into
her
beautiful
face
and
fell
to
wondering
what
could
it
all
mean
so
true
had
she
been
to
him
so
sweet
her
temperament
so
high
all
her
ideals
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
ill
of
her
he
tried
to
fight
down
those
increasing
doubts
he
tried
to
put
aside
the
naked
truth
which
had
arisen
before
him
since
his
return
to
england
he
loved
her
yes
he
loved
her
and
would
think
no
ill
of
her
until
he
had
proof
actual
and
indisputable
as
far
as
the
eligibility
of
walter
murie
was
concerned
there
was
no
question
even
lady
heyburn
could
not
deny
it
when
she
discussed
the
matter
over
the
with
her
intimate
friends
the
family
of
the
muries
of
connachan
claimed
a
respectable
antiquity
the
original
surname
of
the
family
was
de
balinhard
assumed
from
an
estate
of
that
name
in
the
county
of
forfar
sir
jocelynus
de
baldendard
or
balinhard
who
witnessed
several
charters
between
and
is
the
first
recorded
of
the
name
but
there
is
no
documentary
proof
of
descent
before
that
time
and
indeed
most
of
the
family
papers
having
been
burned
in
little
remains
of
the
early
history
beyond
the
names
and
succession
of
the
possessors
of
balinhard
from
about
till
which
are
stated
in
a
charter
of
david
ii
now
preserved
in
the
british
museum
this
charter
records
the
grant
made
by
william
de
maule
to
john
de
balinhard
et
heredi
quondam
joannis
filii
christini
filii
joannis
de
of
the
lands
of
murie
in
the
county
of
perthshire
and
from
that
period
about
the
family
has
borne
the
name
of
de
murie
instead
of
de
balinhard
in
duthac
de
murie
obtained
a
charter
of
the
castle
of
connachan
possession
of
which
has
been
held
by
the
family
uninterruptedly
ever
since
except
for
about
thirty
years
when
the
lands
were
under
forfeiture
on
account
of
the
rebellion
of
near
crieff
junction
station
the
lands
of
glencardine
and
connachan
march
together
therefore
both
sir
henry
heyburn
and
his
friend
sir
george
murie
had
looked
upon
an
alliance
between
the
two
houses
as
quite
within
the
bounds
of
probability
if
the
truth
were
told
gabrielle
had
never
looked
upon
any
other
man
save
walter
with
the
slightest
thought
of
affection
she
loved
him
with
the
whole
strength
of
her
being
during
that
twelve
long
months
of
absence
he
had
been
daily
in
her
thoughts
and
his
constant
letters
she
had
read
and
dozens
of
times
she
had
since
she
left
school
met
many
eligible
young
men
at
houses
to
which
her
mother
had
grudgingly
taken
her
young
men
who
had
been
nice
to
her
flattered
her
and
flirted
with
her
but
she
had
treated
them
all
with
coquettish
disdain
for
in
the
world
there
was
but
one
man
who
was
her
lover
and
her
hero
her
old
friend
walter
murie
at
this
moment
as
they
were
together
in
that
cosy
room
she
became
seized
by
a
twinge
of
conscience
she
knew
quite
well
that
she
was
not
treating
him
as
she
ought
she
had
not
been
at
all
enthusiastic
at
his
return
and
she
had
inquired
but
little
about
his
wanderings
indeed
she
had
treated
him
with
a
studied
indifference
as
though
his
life
concerned
her
but
little
and
yet
if
he
only
knew
the
truth
she
thought
if
he
could
only
see
that
that
cool
unresponsive
attitude
was
forced
upon
her
by
circumstances
if
he
could
only
know
how
quickly
her
heart
throbbed
when
he
was
present
and
how
dull
and
lonely
all
became
when
he
was
absent
she
loved
him
ah
yes
as
truly
and
devotedly
as
he
loved
her
but
between
them
there
had
fallen
a
dark
grim
shadow
one
which
at
all
hazards
and
by
every
subterfuge
she
must
endeavour
to
hide
she
loved
him
and
could
therefore
never
bear
to
hear
his
bitter
reproaches
or
to
witness
his
grief
he
worshipped
her
would
that
he
did
not
she
thought
she
must
hide
her
secret
from
him
as
she
was
hiding
it
from
all
the
world
he
was
speaking
she
answered
him
calmly
yet
mechanically
he
wondered
what
strange
thoughts
were
concealed
beneath
those
clear
eyes
which
he
was
trying
in
vain
to
fathom
what
would
he
have
thought
had
he
known
the
terrible
truth
that
she
had
calmly
and
after
long
reflection
resolved
to
court
death
death
by
her
own
hand
rather
than
face
the
exposure
with
which
she
had
that
previous
night
been
threatened
chapter
vii
contains
curious
confidences
a
week
had
gone
by
stewart
the
lean
who
spoke
with
such
a
strong
accent
that
guests
from
the
south
often
failed
to
understand
him
and
who
never
seemed
to
sleep
so
vigilant
was
he
over
the
glencardine
shootings
had
reported
the
purchase
of
a
couple
of
new
pointers
therefore
one
morning
lady
heyburn
and
her
constant
cavalier
flockart
had
walked
across
to
the
kennels
close
to
the
castle
to
inspect
them
at
the
end
of
the
big
with
grey
stone
outbuildings
ranged
down
either
side
and
the
ancient
a
conspicuous
object
were
ranged
the
modern
iron
kennels
full
of
pointers
and
spaniels
in
that
big
old
paved
quadrangle
the
cobbles
of
which
were
nowadays
stained
by
the
oil
of
noisy
many
a
graham
of
glencardine
had
mounted
to
ride
into
stirling
or
edinburgh
or
to
drive
in
his
coach
to
london
the
stables
were
now
empty
but
the
garage
adjoining
whence
came
the
odour
of
petrol
contained
the
two
glencardine
cars
besides
three
others
belonging
to
members
of
that
merry
irresponsible
the
inspection
of
the
pointers
was
a
mere
excuse
on
her
ladyship
part
to
be
alone
with
flockart
she
wished
to
speak
with
him
and
with
that
object
suggested
that
they
should
take
the
which
crossing
one
of
the
main
roads
through
the
estate
led
through
a
leafy
wood
away
to
a
railway
half
a
mile
off
the
road
was
unfrequented
and
they
were
not
likely
to
meet
any
of
the
guests
for
some
were
away
fishing
others
had
motored
into
stirling
and
at
least
three
had
walked
down
into
auchterarder
to
take
a
telegram
for
their
blind
host
well
my
dear
jimmy
asked
the
woman
in
short
brown
skirt
and
fresh
white
cotton
blouse
and
what
have
you
discovered
very
little
replied
the
man
who
wore
a
suit
of
rough
and
a
round
cloth
my
information
is
unfortunately
very
meagre
you
have
watched
carefully
well
what
have
you
found
out
that
she
just
as
much
in
love
with
him
as
before
the
little
fool
and
i
suppose
he
just
as
devoted
to
her
as
ever
eh
of
course
since
you
been
away
these
last
few
days
he
been
over
here
from
connachan
on
one
pretext
or
another
every
day
of
course
i
been
compelled
to
ask
him
to
lunch
for
i
ca
afford
to
quarrel
with
his
people
although
i
hate
the
whole
lot
of
them
his
mother
gives
herself
such
airs
and
his
father
is
the
most
terrible
old
bore
in
the
whole
country
but
the
match
would
be
an
advantageous
one
would
it
suggested
the
man
strolling
at
her
side
and
he
stopped
to
light
a
cigarette
which
he
took
from
a
golden
case
advantageous
of
course
it
would
but
we
ca
afford
to
allow
it
my
dear
jimmy
think
what
such
an
alliance
would
mean
to
us
to
you
you
mean
to
you
also
an
ugly
revelation
might
result
remember
therefore
it
must
not
be
allowed
while
walter
was
abroad
all
was
pretty
plain
sailing
lots
of
the
letters
she
wrote
him
i
secured
from
the
read
them
and
afterwards
burned
them
but
now
he
back
there
is
a
distinct
peril
he
a
cute
young
fellow
remember
flockart
smiled
we
must
discover
a
means
by
which
to
part
them
he
said
slowly
but
decisively
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
to
allow
the
matter
to
go
any
further
would
be
to
court
disaster
we
have
a
good
many
enemies
you
and
i
winnie
many
who
would
only
be
too
pleased
and
eager
to
rake
up
that
unfortunate
episode
and
i
for
one
have
no
desire
to
figure
in
a
criminal
dock
nor
have
i
she
declared
quickly
but
if
i
went
there
you
would
certainly
accompany
me
he
said
looking
straight
at
her
what
she
gasped
in
quick
dismay
you
would
tell
the
truth
and
and
denounce
me
i
would
not
but
no
doubt
there
are
others
who
would
was
his
answer
for
a
few
moments
her
arched
brows
were
knit
and
she
remained
silent
her
reflections
were
uneasy
ones
she
and
the
man
at
her
side
who
for
years
had
been
her
confidant
and
friend
were
both
in
imminent
peril
of
exposure
their
relations
had
always
been
purely
platonic
therefore
she
was
not
afraid
of
any
allegation
against
her
honour
what
her
enemies
had
said
were
lies
all
of
them
her
fear
lay
in
quite
a
different
direction
her
poor
blind
helpless
husband
was
in
ignorance
of
that
terrible
chapter
of
her
own
life
a
chapter
which
she
had
believed
to
be
closed
for
ever
and
yet
which
was
by
means
of
a
chain
of
unexpected
circumstances
in
imminent
danger
of
being
reopened
well
she
inquired
at
last
in
a
blank
voice
and
who
are
those
others
who
you
believe
would
be
prepared
to
denounce
me
certain
persons
who
envy
you
your
position
and
who
perhaps
think
that
you
do
not
treat
poor
old
sir
henry
quite
properly
but
i
do
treat
him
properly
she
declared
vehemently
if
he
prefers
the
society
of
that
chit
of
a
girl
of
his
to
mine
how
can
i
possibly
help
it
besides
people
surely
must
know
that
to
me
the
society
of
a
blind
old
man
is
not
exactly
conducive
to
gaiety
i
would
only
like
to
put
those
women
who
malign
me
into
my
place
for
a
single
year
perhaps
they
would
become
even
more
reckless
of
the
than
i
am
my
dear
winnie
he
said
what
the
use
of
discussing
such
an
old
and
threadbare
theme
things
are
not
always
what
they
seem
as
the
man
with
a
squint
said
when
he
thought
he
saw
two
sovereigns
where
there
was
but
one
the
point
before
us
is
the
girl
future
it
lies
in
your
hands
was
her
sharp
reply
no
in
yours
i
have
promised
to
look
after
walter
murie
but
how
can
i
act
she
asked
the
little
hussy
cares
nothing
for
me
only
sees
me
at
table
and
spends
the
whole
of
her
day
with
her
father
act
as
i
suggested
last
week
was
his
rejoinder
if
you
did
that
the
old
man
would
turn
her
out
of
the
place
and
the
rest
would
be
easy
enough
but
ah
he
laughed
derisively
i
see
you
some
sympathy
with
the
girl
after
all
very
well
take
the
consequences
it
is
she
who
will
be
your
deadliest
enemy
remember
she
who
if
the
disaster
falls
will
give
evidence
against
you
therefore
you
best
act
now
ere
it
too
late
unless
of
course
you
are
in
fear
of
her
i
do
fear
her
cried
the
woman
her
eyes
flashing
defiance
why
do
you
taunt
me
like
this
you
have
told
me
yet
what
took
place
on
the
night
of
the
ball
nothing
the
mystery
is
just
as
complete
as
ever
she
defied
you
eh
her
companion
nodded
then
how
do
you
now
intend
to
act
that
just
the
question
i
was
about
to
put
to
you
he
said
there
is
a
distinct
peril
one
which
becomes
graver
every
moment
that
the
girl
and
young
murie
are
together
how
are
we
to
avert
it
by
parting
them
then
act
as
i
suggested
the
other
day
it
the
only
way
winnie
depend
upon
it
the
only
way
to
secure
our
own
safety
and
what
would
the
world
say
of
me
her
stepmother
if
it
were
known
that
i
had
done
such
a
thing
you
never
yet
cared
for
what
the
world
said
why
should
you
care
now
besides
it
never
will
be
known
i
should
be
the
only
person
in
the
secret
and
for
my
own
sake
it
is
likely
that
i
give
you
away
is
it
you
trusted
me
before
he
added
why
not
again
it
would
break
my
husband
heart
she
declared
in
a
low
intense
voice
remember
he
is
devoted
to
her
he
would
never
recover
from
the
shock
and
yet
the
other
night
after
the
ball
you
said
you
were
prepared
to
carry
out
the
suggestion
in
order
to
save
yourself
he
remarked
with
a
covert
sneer
perhaps
i
was
piqued
that
she
should
defy
my
suggestion
that
she
should
go
to
the
ball
no
you
were
not
you
never
intended
her
to
go
that
you
know
when
he
spoke
to
her
this
man
never
minced
matters
the
woman
was
held
by
him
in
a
strange
thraldom
which
surprised
many
people
yet
to
all
it
was
a
mystery
the
world
knew
nothing
of
the
fact
that
james
flockart
was
without
a
penny
and
that
he
lived
and
lived
well
too
upon
the
charity
of
lady
heyburn
two
thousand
pounds
were
placed
in
secret
every
year
to
his
credit
from
her
ladyship
private
account
at
coutts
besides
which
he
received
odd
cheques
from
her
whenever
his
needs
required
to
his
friends
he
posed
as
an
in
possession
of
an
income
not
large
but
sufficient
to
supply
him
with
both
comforts
and
luxuries
he
usually
spent
the
london
season
in
his
cosy
chambers
in
street
the
winter
at
monte
carlo
or
at
cairo
the
summer
at
aix
vichy
or
marienbad
and
the
autumn
in
a
series
of
visits
to
houses
in
scotland
he
was
not
exactly
a
ladies
man
courtly
refined
and
a
splendid
linguist
as
he
was
the
girls
always
voted
him
great
fun
but
from
the
elder
ones
and
from
married
women
especially
he
somehow
held
himself
aloof
his
one
as
everybody
knew
was
the
flighty
lady
heyburn
of
the
party
he
was
usually
the
life
and
soul
no
man
could
invent
so
many
practical
jokes
or
carry
them
on
with
such
refinement
of
humour
as
he
therefore
if
the
hostess
wished
to
impart
merriment
among
her
guests
she
sought
out
and
sent
a
pressing
invitation
to
jimmy
flockart
a
shot
an
excellent
a
good
golfer
and
quite
a
good
hand
at
putting
a
stone
in
curling
he
was
an
sportsman
who
was
sure
to
be
highly
popular
with
his
hence
up
in
the
north
his
advent
was
always
welcomed
with
loud
approbation
to
those
who
knew
him
and
knew
him
well
this
confidential
conversation
with
the
woman
whose
platonic
friendship
he
had
enjoyed
through
so
many
years
would
certainly
have
caused
greatest
surprise
that
he
was
a
schemer
was
entirely
undreamed
of
that
he
was
attracted
by
winnie
heyburn
was
declared
to
be
only
natural
in
view
of
the
age
and
affliction
of
her
own
husband
cases
such
as
hers
are
often
regarded
with
a
very
lenient
eye
they
had
reached
the
where
beside
the
line
of
the
caledonian
railway
stands
the
by
which
the
for
euston
picks
up
the
local
bag
without
stopping
while
the
drops
its
letters
and
parcels
into
the
big
strong
net
for
a
few
moments
they
halted
to
watch
the
express
for
euston
pass
with
a
roar
and
a
crash
as
she
dashed
down
the
incline
towards
crieff
junction
then
as
they
turned
again
towards
the
house
he
suddenly
exclaimed
look
here
winnie
we
got
to
face
the
music
now
every
day
increases
our
peril
if
you
are
actually
afraid
to
act
as
i
suggest
then
tell
me
frankly
and
i
know
what
to
do
i
tell
you
quite
openly
that
i
have
neither
desire
nor
intention
to
be
put
into
a
hole
by
this
confounded
girl
she
has
defied
me
therefore
she
must
take
the
consequences
how
do
you
know
that
your
action
the
other
night
has
not
aroused
her
suspicions
ah
there
you
are
quite
right
it
may
have
done
so
if
it
has
then
our
peril
has
very
considerably
increased
that
just
my
argument
but
we
have
walter
to
reckon
with
in
any
case
he
loves
her
bah
leave
the
boy
to
me
i
soon
show
him
that
the
girl
not
worth
a
second
thought
replied
flockart
with
nonchalant
air
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
act
as
i
suggested
the
other
night
then
leave
the
rest
to
me
and
suppose
it
were
discovered
asked
the
woman
whose
face
had
grown
considerably
paler
well
suppose
the
worst
happened
and
it
were
discovered
he
asked
raising
his
brows
slightly
should
we
be
any
worse
off
than
would
be
the
case
if
this
girl
took
it
into
her
head
to
expose
us
if
the
facts
which
she
could
prove
placed
us
side
by
side
in
an
the
woman
clever
scheming
ambitious
was
silent
the
question
admitted
of
no
reply
she
recognised
her
own
peril
the
picture
of
herself
arraigned
before
a
judge
with
that
man
beside
her
rose
before
her
imagination
and
she
became
terrified
that
slim
girl
her
husband
child
stood
between
her
and
her
own
honour
her
own
safety
once
the
girl
was
removed
she
would
have
no
further
fear
no
apprehension
no
hideous
forebodings
concerning
the
imminent
future
she
saw
it
all
as
she
walked
along
that
her
eyes
fixed
straight
before
her
the
tempter
at
her
side
had
urged
her
to
commit
a
dastardly
an
unpardonable
crime
in
that
man
hands
she
was
alas
as
wax
he
poured
into
her
ear
a
vivid
picture
of
what
must
inevitably
result
should
gabrielle
reveal
the
ugly
truth
at
the
same
time
calmly
watching
the
effect
of
his
words
upon
her
upon
her
decision
depended
his
whole
future
as
well
as
hers
what
was
gabrielle
life
to
hers
asked
the
man
that
was
the
question
which
decided
her
decided
her
after
long
and
futile
resistance
to
promise
to
commit
the
act
which
he
had
suggested
she
gave
the
man
her
hand
in
pledge
then
a
slight
smile
of
triumph
played
about
his
cruel
nether
lip
and
the
pair
retraced
their
steps
towards
the
castle
in
silence
chapter
viii
casting
the
bait
loving
and
perishing
these
have
tallied
from
eternity
love
and
death
walk
the
will
to
love
means
also
to
be
ready
for
death
gabrielle
heyburn
recognised
this
truth
she
had
the
will
to
love
and
she
had
the
resolve
to
perish
perish
by
her
own
hand
rather
than
allow
her
secret
to
be
exposed
those
who
knew
her
a
young
athletic
girl
on
the
verge
of
budding
womanhood
so
frank
and
free
little
dreamed
of
the
terrible
nature
of
that
secret
within
her
young
heart
she
held
aloof
from
her
lover
as
much
as
she
dared
true
walter
came
to
glencardine
nearly
every
day
but
she
managed
to
avoid
him
whenever
possible
why
because
she
knew
her
own
weakness
she
feared
being
compelled
by
his
stronger
nature
and
by
the
true
affection
in
which
she
held
him
to
confess
they
walked
together
in
the
cool
shady
glen
beside
the
rippling
burn
climbed
the
neighbouring
hills
played
tennis
or
else
she
lay
in
the
hammock
at
the
edge
of
the
lawn
while
he
lounged
at
her
side
smoking
cigarettes
she
did
all
this
because
she
was
compelled
her
most
enjoyable
hours
were
the
quiet
ones
spent
at
her
father
side
alone
in
the
library
she
read
to
him
in
french
those
curious
business
documents
which
came
so
often
by
registered
post
they
were
so
strangely
worded
that
not
knowing
their
true
import
she
failed
to
understand
them
all
were
neatly
typed
without
any
heading
to
the
paper
sometimes
a
printed
address
in
the
boulevard
des
capucines
paris
would
appear
on
letters
accompanying
the
enclosures
but
all
were
very
formal
and
to
gabrielle
extremely
puzzling
sir
henry
always
took
the
greatest
precaution
that
no
one
should
obtain
sight
of
these
confidential
reports
or
overhear
them
read
by
his
daughter
before
she
sat
down
to
read
she
always
shot
the
small
brass
bolt
on
the
door
to
prevent
hill
or
any
other
intruder
from
entering
more
than
once
the
baronet
wife
had
wanted
to
come
in
while
the
reading
was
in
progress
whereupon
sir
henry
always
excused
himself
saying
that
he
locked
his
door
against
his
guests
when
he
wished
to
be
alone
an
explanation
which
her
ladyship
accepted
these
strangely
worded
reports
in
french
always
puzzled
the
daughter
sometimes
she
became
seized
by
a
vague
suspicion
that
her
father
was
carrying
on
some
business
which
was
not
altogether
honourable
why
should
he
enjoin
such
secrecy
why
should
he
cause
her
to
write
and
despatch
with
her
own
hand
such
curiously
worded
telegrams
addressed
always
to
the
registered
address
meteforos
paris
those
neatly
typed
pages
which
she
read
could
be
always
construed
in
two
or
three
senses
but
only
her
father
knew
the
actual
meaning
which
the
writer
intended
to
convey
for
hours
she
would
often
be
engaged
in
reading
them
sometimes
too
telegrams
in
cipher
arrived
and
she
would
then
obtain
the
little
covered
book
from
the
safe
and
by
its
aid
decipher
the
messages
from
the
french
capital
questions
curious
questions
were
frequently
asked
by
the
anonymous
sender
of
the
reports
and
to
these
her
father
replied
by
means
of
his
private
code
she
had
become
during
the
past
year
quite
an
expert
typist
and
therefore
to
her
the
baronet
entrusted
the
replies
always
impressing
upon
her
the
need
of
absolute
secrecy
even
from
her
mother
my
affairs
he
often
declared
concern
nobody
but
myself
i
trust
in
you
gabrielle
dear
to
guard
my
secrets
from
prying
eyes
i
know
that
you
yourself
must
often
be
puzzled
but
that
is
only
natural
unfamiliar
as
the
girl
was
with
business
in
any
form
she
had
during
the
past
year
arrived
at
the
conclusion
after
much
debate
within
herself
that
this
source
of
her
father
income
was
a
distinctly
mysterious
one
the
estates
were
of
course
large
and
he
employed
agents
to
manage
them
but
they
could
not
produce
that
huge
income
which
she
knew
he
possessed
for
had
she
not
more
than
once
seen
the
amount
of
his
balance
at
his
banker
as
well
as
the
large
sum
he
had
on
deposit
the
source
of
his
colossal
wealth
was
a
mystery
but
was
no
doubt
connected
with
his
curious
and
constant
communications
with
paris
at
rare
intervals
a
and
rather
stout
frenchman
a
certain
monsieur
goslin
called
and
on
such
occasions
was
closeted
for
a
long
time
alone
with
sir
henry
evidently
discussing
some
important
affair
in
secret
to
her
ladyship
as
well
as
to
gabrielle
the
frenchman
was
most
courteous
but
refused
the
pressing
invitations
to
remain
the
night
he
always
arrived
by
the
morning
train
from
perth
and
left
for
the
south
the
same
night
the
express
being
stopped
for
him
by
signal
at
auchterarder
station
the
mysterious
visitor
puzzled
gabrielle
considerably
her
father
entrusted
him
with
secrets
which
he
withheld
from
her
and
this
often
caused
her
both
surprise
and
annoyance
like
every
other
girl
she
was
of
course
full
of
curiosity
towards
her
flockart
became
daily
more
friendly
on
two
occasions
after
breakfast
he
had
invited
her
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
fishing
for
trout
in
the
burn
which
was
unexpectedly
in
spate
and
they
had
thus
been
some
time
in
each
other
company
she
however
regarded
him
with
distinct
distrust
he
was
undeniably
nonchalant
and
a
man
of
the
world
but
his
intimate
friendship
with
lady
heyburn
prevented
her
from
regarding
him
as
a
true
friend
towards
her
he
was
ever
most
courteous
and
paid
her
many
little
compliments
he
tied
her
flies
he
fitted
her
rod
and
if
her
line
became
entangled
in
the
trees
he
always
put
matters
right
not
however
that
she
could
not
do
it
all
herself
in
her
strong
high
her
short
skirts
hemmed
with
leather
her
burberry
and
her
set
jauntily
on
her
chestnut
hair
she
very
often
fished
alone
and
made
quite
respectable
baskets
to
wade
into
the
burn
and
disentangle
her
line
from
beneath
a
stone
was
to
her
quite
a
small
occurrence
for
she
would
never
let
either
stewart
or
any
of
the
accompany
her
why
flockart
had
so
suddenly
sought
her
society
she
failed
to
discern
hitherto
though
always
extremely
polite
he
had
treated
her
as
a
child
which
she
naturally
resented
at
length
however
he
seemed
to
have
realised
that
she
now
possessed
the
average
intelligence
of
a
young
woman
he
had
never
repeated
those
strange
words
he
had
uttered
when
on
the
night
of
the
ball
at
connachan
he
returned
in
secret
to
the
castle
and
beckoned
her
out
upon
the
lawn
he
had
indeed
never
referred
to
his
curious
action
sometimes
she
wondered
so
changed
was
his
manner
whether
he
had
actually
forgotten
the
incident
altogether
he
had
showed
himself
in
his
true
colours
that
night
whatever
suspicions
she
had
previously
held
were
corroborated
in
that
stroll
across
the
lawn
in
the
dark
shadow
his
tactics
had
altered
it
seemed
and
their
objective
puzzled
her
it
must
be
very
dull
for
you
here
miss
heyburn
he
remarked
to
her
one
bright
morning
as
they
were
casting
near
one
another
they
were
standing
not
far
from
a
rustic
bridge
in
a
deep
leafy
glen
where
the
sunshine
penetrated
here
and
there
through
the
canopy
of
leaves
beneath
which
the
burn
pursued
its
sinuous
course
towards
the
earn
the
music
of
the
rippling
waters
over
the
brown
boulders
mingled
with
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
above
as
now
and
then
the
soft
wind
swept
up
the
narrow
valley
they
were
treading
a
carpet
of
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
delicious
perfume
of
the
summer
day
you
must
be
very
dull
living
here
so
much
and
going
up
to
town
so
very
seldom
he
said
oh
dear
no
she
laughed
you
are
quite
mistaken
i
really
enjoy
a
country
life
it
so
jolly
after
the
confinement
and
rigorous
rules
of
school
one
is
free
up
here
i
can
wear
my
old
clothes
and
go
cycling
fishing
shooting
curling
in
fact
i
my
own
mistress
that
i
should
be
if
i
lived
in
london
and
had
to
make
calls
walk
in
the
park
go
shopping
sit
out
concerts
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
though
you
out
you
never
go
anywhere
surely
that
unusual
for
one
so
active
and
well
he
hesitated
i
wonder
whether
i
might
be
permitted
to
say
so
so
as
you
are
gabrielle
ah
replied
the
girl
protesting
but
blushing
at
the
same
time
you
poking
fun
at
me
flockart
all
i
can
reply
is
first
that
i
not
and
secondly
i
not
in
the
least
dull
perhaps
i
should
be
if
i
had
my
father
affairs
to
attend
to
they
seem
to
take
up
a
lot
of
your
time
he
said
with
pretended
indifference
but
to
his
annoyance
landed
a
salmon
parr
at
the
same
moment
we
work
together
most
evenings
was
her
reply
the
question
which
he
then
put
as
he
threw
the
parr
back
into
the
burn
struck
her
as
curious
it
was
evident
that
he
was
endeavouring
to
learn
from
her
the
nature
of
her
father
correspondence
but
she
was
shrewd
enough
to
parry
all
his
ingenious
her
secrets
were
her
own
some
people
gossip
about
sir
henry
he
remarked
presently
as
he
made
another
long
cast
and
allowed
the
flies
to
be
carried
down
to
within
a
few
yards
from
where
he
stood
they
say
that
his
source
of
income
is
mysterious
and
that
it
is
not
altogether
open
and
what
she
exclaimed
looking
at
him
quickly
and
who
pray
flockart
makes
this
allegation
against
my
father
oh
i
really
do
know
who
started
the
gossip
the
source
of
such
tales
is
always
difficult
to
discover
some
enemy
no
doubt
every
man
in
this
world
of
ours
has
enemies
what
do
you
mean
by
the
source
of
dad
income
not
being
an
honourable
one
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
really
do
know
he
declared
i
only
repeat
what
i
heard
once
or
twice
up
in
london
tell
me
exactly
what
they
say
demanded
the
girl
with
quick
interest
her
companion
hesitated
for
a
few
seconds
well
whatever
has
been
said
i
always
denied
for
as
you
know
i
am
a
friend
of
both
lady
heyburn
and
of
your
father
the
girl
nostrils
dilated
slightly
friend
why
was
not
this
man
her
father
false
friend
was
he
not
behind
every
sinister
action
of
lady
heyburn
and
had
not
she
herself
with
her
own
ears
one
day
at
park
street
four
years
ago
overheard
her
ladyship
express
a
dastardly
desire
in
the
words
oh
henry
is
such
a
dreadful
old
bore
and
so
utterly
useless
that
it
a
shame
a
woman
like
myself
should
be
tied
up
to
him
fortunately
for
me
he
already
has
one
foot
in
the
grave
otherwise
i
could
tolerate
this
life
at
all
those
cruel
words
of
her
stepmother
spoken
to
this
man
who
was
at
that
moment
her
companion
recurred
to
her
she
recollected
too
flockart
reply
this
hollow
pretence
of
friendship
angered
her
she
knew
that
the
man
was
her
father
enemy
and
that
he
had
united
with
the
clever
scheming
woman
in
some
ingenious
conspiracy
against
the
poor
helpless
man
therefore
she
turned
and
facing
him
boldly
said
i
wish
flockart
that
you
would
please
understand
that
i
have
no
intention
to
discuss
my
father
or
his
affairs
the
latter
concern
himself
alone
he
does
not
even
speak
of
them
to
his
wife
therefore
why
should
strangers
evince
any
interest
in
them
because
there
are
rumours
rumours
of
a
mystery
and
mysteries
are
always
interesting
and
attractive
was
his
answer
true
she
said
meaningly
just
as
rumours
concerning
certain
of
my
father
guests
possess
an
unusual
interest
for
him
flockart
though
my
father
may
be
blind
his
hearing
is
still
excellent
and
he
is
aware
of
much
more
than
you
think
the
man
glanced
at
her
for
an
instant
and
his
face
darkened
the
ominous
words
filled
him
with
vague
apprehension
was
it
possible
that
the
blind
man
had
any
suspicion
of
what
was
intended
he
held
his
breath
and
made
another
vicious
cast
far
up
the
rippling
stream
chapter
ix
reveals
a
mysterious
business
in
the
few
days
which
followed
lady
heyburn
attitude
towards
gabrielle
became
one
of
marked
affection
she
even
kissed
her
in
the
each
morning
called
her
dear
and
consulted
her
upon
the
day
arrangements
poor
sir
henry
was
but
a
cipher
in
the
household
he
usually
took
all
his
meals
alone
except
dinner
and
was
very
seldom
seen
save
perhaps
when
he
would
come
out
for
an
hour
or
so
to
walk
in
the
park
led
by
his
daughter
or
else
alone
tapping
before
him
with
his
stout
stick
on
such
occasions
he
would
wear
a
pair
of
big
blue
spectacles
to
hide
the
unsightliness
of
his
gray
filmy
eyes
sometimes
he
would
sit
on
one
of
the
garden
seats
on
the
south
side
of
the
house
enjoying
the
sunshine
and
listening
to
the
songs
of
the
birds
the
hum
of
the
insects
and
the
soft
ripples
of
the
burn
far
below
and
on
such
occasions
one
of
his
wife
guests
would
join
him
to
chat
and
cheer
him
for
everyone
felt
pity
for
the
lonely
man
living
his
life
of
darkness
no
one
was
more
full
of
words
of
sympathy
than
james
flockart
gabrielle
longed
to
warn
her
father
of
that
man
but
dared
not
do
so
there
was
a
reason
a
strong
reason
for
her
silence
sir
henry
had
declared
that
he
was
interested
in
the
man
intellectual
conversation
and
that
he
rather
liked
him
though
he
had
never
looked
upon
his
face
in
some
things
the
old
gentleman
was
ever
ready
to
adopt
his
daughter
advice
and
rely
upon
her
judgment
but
in
others
he
was
quite
obstinate
and
treated
her
pointed
remarks
with
calm
indifference
one
day
at
lady
heyburn
suggestion
gabrielle
accompanied
by
flockart
and
another
of
the
guests
a
retired
colonel
had
driven
over
in
the
big
car
to
perth
to
make
a
call
and
on
their
return
she
spent
some
hours
in
the
library
with
her
father
attending
to
his
correspondence
that
morning
a
big
packet
of
those
typed
reports
in
french
had
arrived
in
the
usual
registered
envelope
and
after
she
had
read
them
over
to
the
baronet
he
had
given
her
the
key
and
she
had
got
out
the
then
at
his
instructions
she
had
written
upon
a
yellow
a
cipher
message
addressed
to
the
mysterious
meteforos

then

expect
report
of
bedford
it
was
not
signed
by
the
baronet
name
but
by
the
signature
he
always
used
on
such
telegraphic
replies
senrab
from
such
a
despatch
she
could
gather
nothing
at
his
request
she
took
away
the
little
book
and
relocked
it
in
the
safe
then
she
rang
for
hill
and
told
him
to
send
the
despatch
by
messenger
down
to
auchterarder
village
very
well
miss
replied
the
man
bowing
the
car
is
going
down
to
take
seymour
to
the
station
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
so
stokes
will
take
it
and
look
here
exclaimed
the
blind
man
who
was
standing
before
the
window
with
his
back
to
the
crimson
sunset
you
can
tell
her
ladyship
hill
that
i
very
busy
and
i
sha
come
in
to
dinner
just
serve
a
snack
here
for
me
will
you
very
well
sir
henry
responded
the
smart
footman
and
bowing
again
he
closed
the
door
may
i
dine
with
you
dad
asked
the
girl
there
are
two
or
three
people
invited
and
they
do
interest
me
in
the
least
my
dear
child
what
do
you
mean
why
are
walter
murie
and
his
mother
dining
here
i
know
your
mother
invited
them
ten
days
ago
oh
why
yes
replied
the
girl
rather
lamely
i
did
not
recollect
then
i
suppose
i
must
put
in
an
appearance
she
sighed
suppose
he
echoed
what
would
walter
think
if
you
elected
to
dine
with
me
instead
of
meeting
him
at
table
now
dad
it
is
really
unkind
of
you
she
said
reprovingly
walter
and
i
thoroughly
understand
each
other
he
not
surprised
at
anything
i
do
ah
laughed
the
sightless
man
he
already
beginning
to
understand
the
feminine
perverseness
eh
well
my
child
dine
here
with
me
if
you
wish
by
all
means
tell
hill
to
lay
the
table
for
two
we
have
lots
of
work
to
do
afterwards
so
the
bell
was
rung
again
and
hill
was
informed
that
miss
gabrielle
would
dine
with
her
father
in
the
library
then
they
turned
again
to
the
baronet
mysterious
private
affairs
and
when
she
had
seated
herself
at
the
typewriter
and
the
reports
confidential
reports
they
were
but
framed
in
a
manner
which
only
the
old
man
himself
could
understand
he
dictated
to
her
cryptic
replies
the
true
nature
of
which
were
to
her
a
mystery
the
last
of
the
reports
brief
and
unsigned
read
as
follows
mon
petit
gar√ßon
est
tr√®s
gravement
malade
et
je
supplie
dieu
√†
genoux
de
ne
pas
me
punir
si
severement
de
ne
pas
me
prendre
mon

le

et

je
ne
quitte
plus
son
chevet
et
sans
cesse
je
me
dis
une
punition
du
ciel
gabrielle
saw
that
to
the
outside
world
it
was
a
statement
by
a
frantic
mother
that
her
child
had
caught
what
could
it
really
mean
she
wondered
slowly
she
read
it
and
as
she
did
so
noticed
the
curious
effect
it
had
upon
her
father
seated
as
he
was
in
the
deep
chair
his
face
grew
very
grave
his
thin
white
hands
clenched
themselves
and
there
was
an
unusually
bitter
expression
about
his
mouth
eh
he
asked
as
though
not
quite
certain
of
the
words
read
it
again
child
slower
i
i
have
to
think
she
obeyed
wondering
if
the
key
to
the
cryptic
message
were
contained
in
some
conjunction
of
letters
or
words
it
seemed
as
though
in
imagination
he
was
setting
it
down
before
him
as
she
pronounced
the
words
this
was
often
so
at
times
he
would
have
reports
repeated
to
him
over
and
over
again
ah
he
gasped
at
last
drawing
a
long
breath
his
hands
still
tightly
clenched
his
countenance
haggard
and
drawn
i
i
expected
that
and
so
it
has
come
at
last
what
dad
asked
the
girl
in
surprise
staring
at
the
crisp
typewritten
sheet
before
her
oh
well
nothing
child
nothing
he
answered
bestirring
himself
but
the
lady
whoever
she
is
seems
terribly
concerned
about
her
little
boy
the
judgment
of
heaven
she
calls
it
and
well
she
may
gabrielle
he
answered
in
a
hoarse
strained
voice
well
she
may
my
dear
it
is
a
punishment
sent
upon
the
wicked
is
the
mother
wicked
then
asked
the
girl
in
curiosity
no
dear
he
urged
do
try
to
understand
for
you
can
never
do
that
these
reports
convey
to
me
alone
the
truth
they
are
intended
to
mislead
you
as
they
mislead
other
people
then
there
is
no
little
boy
suffering
from
yes
because
it
is
written
there
was
his
smiling
reply
but
it
only
refers
to
an
imaginary
child
and
by
so
doing
places
a
surprising
and
alarming
truth
before
me
is
the
matter
so
very
serious
dad
she
asked
noticing
the
curious
effect
the
words
had
had
upon
him
serious
he
echoed
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
yes
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
it
is
very
serious
child
both
to
me
and
to
you
i
do
understand
you
dad
she
exclaimed
walking
to
his
chair
throwing
herself
upon
her
knees
and
placing
her
arms
around
his
neck
wo
you
be
more
explicit
wo
you
tell
me
the
truth
surely
you
can
rely
upon
my
secrecy
yes
child
he
said
groping
until
his
hand
fell
upon
her
hair
and
then
stroking
it
tenderly
i
trust
you
you
keep
my
affairs
from
those
people
who
seek
to
obtain
knowledge
of
them
without
you
i
would
be
compelled
to
employ
a
secretary
but
he
could
be
bought
without
a
doubt
most
secretaries
can
ford
was
very
trustworthy
was
he
not
yes
poor
ford
he
sighed
when
he
died
i
lost
my
right
hand
but
fortunately
you
were
old
enough
to
take
his
place
but
in
a
case
like
this
when
you
are
worried
and
excited
as
you
are
at
this
moment
why
not
confide
in
me
and
allow
me
to
help
you
she
suggested
you
see
that
although
i
act
as
your
secretary
dad
i
know
nothing
of
the
nature
of
your
business
and
forgive
me
for
speaking
very
plainly
child
i
do
not
intend
that
you
should
the
old
man
said
because
you
can
not
trust
me
she
pouted
you
think
that
because
i
a
woman
i
can
not
keep
a
secret
not
at
all
he
said
i
place
every
confidence
in
you
dear
you
are
the
only
real
friend
left
to
me
in
the
whole
world
i
know
that
you
would
never
willingly
betray
me
to
my
enemies
but
well
but
what
but
you
might
do
so
unknowingly
you
might
by
one
single
place
me
within
the
power
of
those
who
seek
my
downfall
who
seeks
your
downfall
dad
she
asked
very
seriously
that
a
matter
which
i
desire
to
keep
to
myself
unfortunately
i
do
not
know
the
identity
of
my
enemies
hence
i
am
compelled
to
keep
from
you
certain
matters
which
in
other
circumstances
you
might
know
but
he
added
this
is
not
the
first
time
we
discussed
this
question
gabrielle
dear
you
are
my
daughter
and
i
trust
you
do
not
child
misjudge
me
by
suspecting
that
i
doubt
your
loyalty
i
do
dad
only
sometimes
i
sometimes
you
think
he
said
still
stroking
her
hair
you
think
that
i
ought
to
tell
you
the
reason
i
receive
all
these
reports
from
paris
and
their
real
significance
well
to
tell
the
truth
dear
it
is
best
that
you
should
not
know
if
you
reflect
for
a
moment
went
on
the
old
man
tears
welling
slowly
in
his
filmy
sightless
eyes
you
will
realise
my
unhappy
situation
how
i
am
compelled
to
hide
my
affairs
even
from
lady
heyburn
herself
does
she
ever
question
you
regarding
them
she
used
to
at
one
time
but
she
refrains
nowadays
for
i
would
tell
her
nothing
has
anyone
else
ever
tried
to
glean
information
from
you
he
inquired
after
a
long
breath
flockart
has
done
so
on
several
occasions
of
late
but
i
pleaded
absolute
ignorance
oh
flockart
has
been
asking
you
has
he
remarked
her
father
with
surprise
well
i
suppose
it
is
only
natural
a
blind
man
doings
are
always
more
or
less
a
mystery
to
the
world
i
do
like
flockart
dad
she
said
so
you
remarked
before
my
dear
her
father
replied
of
course
you
are
right
in
withholding
any
information
upon
a
subject
which
is
my
own
affair
yet
on
the
other
hand
you
should
always
remember
that
he
is
your
mother
very
good
friend
and
yours
also
mine
gasped
the
girl
starting
up
would
that
she
were
free
to
tell
the
poor
blind
helpless
man
the
ghastly
truth
my
friend
dad
what
makes
you
think
that
because
he
is
always
singing
your
praises
both
to
me
and
your
mother
then
i
tell
you
that
his
expressions
of
opinion
are
false
dear
dad
how
she
was
silent
she
dared
not
tell
her
father
the
reason
therefore
in
order
to
turn
the
subject
she
replied
with
a
forced
laugh
oh
well
of
course
i
may
be
mistaken
but
that
my
opinion
a
mere
prejudice
child
i
sure
it
is
as
far
as
i
know
flockart
is
quite
an
excellent
fellow
and
is
most
kind
both
to
your
mother
and
to
myself
gabrielle
brow
contracted
disengaging
herself
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
after
a
pause
asked
what
reply
shall
i
send
to
the
report
dad
ah
that
report
gasped
the
man
huddled
up
in
his
chair
in
serious
reflection
that
report
he
repeated
rising
to
straighten
himself
reply
in
these
words
effort
is
to
be
made
to
save
the
life
on
the
contrary
it
is
to
be
so
neglected
as
to
produce
a
fatal
termination
the
girl
had
seated
herself
at
the
typewriter
and
rapidly
clicked
out
the
words
in
french
words
that
seemed
ominous
enough
and
yet
the
true
meaning
of
which
she
never
dreamed
she
was
thinking
only
of
her
father
misplaced
friendship
in
james
flockart
if
she
dared
to
tell
him
the
naked
truth
oh
if
her
poor
blind
afflicted
father
could
only
see
chapter
x
declares
a
woman
love
at
nine
that
night
gabrielle
left
her
father
and
ascended
to
her
own
pretty
room
with
its
light
furniture
its
bamboo
bookcases
its
little
and
its
narrow
bed
in
the
alcove
it
was
a
nest
of
rest
and
cosy
comfort
exchanging
her
tweed
dress
she
put
on
an
easy
of
pale
blue
cashmere
drew
up
an
armchair
and
arranging
her
electric
sat
down
to
a
new
novel
she
intended
to
finish
presently
elise
came
to
her
but
looking
up
she
said
she
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
and
again
coiled
herself
up
in
the
chair
endeavouring
to
concentrate
her
thoughts
upon
her
book
but
all
to
no
purpose
ever
and
anon
she
would
lift
her
big
eyes
from
the
printed
page
sigh
and
stare
fixedly
at
the
trellis
pattern
of
the
opposite
upon
her
there
had
fallen
a
feeling
of
vague
apprehension
such
as
she
had
never
before
experienced
a
feeling
that
something
was
about
to
happen
lady
heyburn
was
she
knew
greatly
annoyed
that
she
had
not
made
her
appearance
at
dinner
or
in
the
afterwards
generally
when
there
were
guests
from
the
neighbourhood
she
was
compelled
to
sing
one
or
other
of
her
italian
songs
her
refusal
to
come
to
dinner
would
she
knew
cause
her
ladyship
much
chagrin
for
it
showed
plainly
to
the
guests
that
her
authority
over
her
was
entirely
at
an
end
just
as
the
chimed
ten
there
came
a
light
tap
at
the
door
it
was
hill
who
on
receiving
permission
to
enter
said
if
you
please
miss
murie
has
just
asked
me
to
give
you
this
and
he
handed
her
an
envelope
tearing
it
open
eagerly
she
found
a
upon
which
some
words
were
scribbled
in
pencil
for
a
moment
after
reading
them
she
paused
then
she
said
tell
murie
it
will
be
all
right
very
well
miss
the
man
replied
and
bowing
closed
the
door
for
a
few
moments
she
stood
motionless
in
the
centre
of
the
room
her
lover
card
still
in
her
hand
then
she
walked
to
the
open
window
and
looked
out
into
the
hot
oppressive
night
the
moon
was
hidden
behind
dark
clouds
and
the
stillness
was
precursory
of
the
thunderstorm
which
for
the
past
hour
or
so
had
threatened
across
the
room
she
paced
slowly
several
times
a
deep
anxious
expression
upon
her
pale
countenance
then
slowly
she
slipped
off
her
gown
and
put
on
a
dark
stuff
dress
until
the
clock
had
struck
eleven
she
waited
then
assuming
her
and
twisting
a
silk
scarf
about
her
neck
she
crept
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
wide
oak
stairs
lights
were
still
burning
but
without
detection
she
slipped
out
by
the
main
door
and
crossing
the
broad
drive
took
the
winding
path
into
the
woods
the
guests
had
all
left
and
the
servants
were
closing
the
house
for
the
night
scarce
had
she
gone
a
hundred
yards
when
a
dark
figure
in
overcoat
and
a
loomed
up
before
her
and
she
found
walter
at
her
side
why
dearest
he
exclaimed
taking
her
hand
and
bending
till
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
i
began
to
fear
you
would
come
why
i
seen
you
because
well
because
i
had
a
bad
headache
was
her
lame
reply
i
knew
that
if
i
went
in
to
dinner
mother
would
want
me
to
sing
and
i
really
did
feel
up
to
it
i
hope
however
you
have
been
bored
too
much
you
know
i
have
he
said
quickly
in
a
low
earnest
voice
i
came
here
purposely
to
see
you
and
you
were
invisible
i
run
the
car
down
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
park
and
left
it
there
the
mater
went
home
in
the
carriage
nearly
an
hour
ago
she
afraid
to
go
in
the
car
when
i
drive
slowly
they
strolled
together
along
the
dark
path
he
with
her
arm
held
tenderly
under
his
own
think
darling
he
said
i
have
seen
you
for
four
whole
days
why
is
it
yesterday
i
went
to
the
usual
spot
at
the
end
of
the
glen
and
waited
nearly
two
hours
but
you
did
not
come
although
you
promised
me
you
know
why
are
you
so
indifferent
dearest
he
asked
in
a
plaintive
tone
i
ca
really
make
you
out
of
late
i
not
indifferent
at
all
walter
she
declared
my
father
has
very
much
to
attend
to
just
now
and
i
compelled
to
assist
him
as
you
are
well
aware
he
so
utterly
helpless
oh
but
you
might
spare
me
just
sometimes
he
said
in
a
slight
tone
of
reproach
i
do
why
we
surely
see
each
other
very
often
not
often
enough
for
me
gabrielle
he
declared
halting
in
the
darkness
and
raising
her
soft
little
hand
to
his
eager
lips
you
know
well
enough
how
fondly
i
love
you
how
i
know
she
said
in
a
sad
blank
tone
her
own
heart
beat
fast
at
his
passionate
words
then
why
do
you
treat
me
like
this
he
asked
is
it
because
i
have
annoyed
you
that
you
perhaps
think
i
am
not
keeping
faith
with
you
i
know
i
was
absent
a
long
time
but
it
was
really
not
my
own
fault
my
people
made
me
go
round
the
world
i
did
want
to
i
assure
you
far
rather
have
been
up
here
at
connachan
all
the
time
and
near
you
my
own
i
believe
you
would
walter
she
answered
turning
towards
him
with
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
but
i
do
wish
you
would
reproach
me
for
my
undemonstrativeness
each
time
we
meet
it
saddens
me
i
know
i
ought
not
to
reproach
you
he
hastened
to
assure
her
i
have
no
right
to
do
so
but
somehow
you
have
of
late
grown
so
that
you
are
not
the
gabrielle
i
used
to
know
why
not
and
she
laughed
a
strange
hollow
laugh
explain
yourself
in
the
days
gone
by
before
i
went
abroad
you
were
not
so
particular
about
our
meetings
being
clandestine
you
did
not
care
who
saw
us
or
what
people
might
say
i
was
a
girl
then
i
have
now
learnt
wisdom
and
the
truth
of
the
modern
religion
which
holds
that
the
only
sin
is
that
of
being
found
out
but
why
are
you
so
secret
in
all
your
actions
he
demanded
whom
do
you
fear
fear
she
echoed
starting
and
staring
in
his
direction
why
i
fear
nobody
what
what
makes
you
think
that
because
it
has
lately
struck
me
that
you
meet
me
in
secret
because
well
because
you
are
afraid
of
someone
or
do
not
wish
us
to
be
seen
why
how
very
foolish
she
laughed
do
my
father
and
mother
both
know
that
we
love
each
other
besides
i
am
surely
my
own
mistress
i
would
never
marry
a
man
i
do
love
she
added
in
a
tone
of
quiet
defiance
and
am
i
to
take
it
that
you
really
do
love
me
after
all
he
inquired
very
earnestly
why
of
course
she
replied
without
hesitation
again
placing
her
arm
about
his
neck
and
kissing
him
how
foolish
of
you
to
ask
such
a
question
walter
when
will
you
be
convinced
that
the
answer
i
gave
you
long
ago
was
the
actual
truth
men
who
love
as
fervently
as
i
do
are
apt
to
be
somewhat
foolish
he
declared
then
do
be
foolish
any
longer
she
urged
in
a
voice
lifting
her
lips
to
his
and
kissing
him
you
know
i
love
you
walter
therefore
you
should
also
know
that
it
i
avoid
you
in
public
i
have
some
good
reason
for
doing
so
a
reason
he
cried
what
reason
tell
me
she
shook
her
head
that
is
my
own
affair
she
responded
i
repeat
again
that
my
affection
for
you
is
undiminished
if
such
repetition
really
pleases
you
as
it
seems
to
do
of
course
it
pleases
me
dearest
he
declared
no
words
are
sweeter
to
my
ears
than
the
declaration
of
your
love
my
only
regret
is
that
now
i
am
at
home
again
i
do
not
see
so
much
of
you
sweetheart
as
i
had
anticipated
walter
she
exclaimed
in
a
slow
changed
voice
after
a
brief
silence
there
is
a
reason
please
do
not
ask
me
to
tell
you
because
well
because
i
ca
and
drawing
a
long
breath
she
added
all
i
beg
of
you
is
to
remain
patient
and
trust
in
me
i
love
you
and
i
love
no
other
man
surely
that
should
be
for
you
i
am
yours
and
yours
only
in
an
instant
he
had
folded
her
slight
dainty
form
in
his
arms
the
young
man
was
satisfied
perfectly
satisfied
they
strolled
on
together
through
the
wood
and
out
across
the
open
the
moon
had
come
forth
again
the
had
passed
and
the
night
was
perfect
though
she
was
trying
against
her
will
to
hold
aloof
from
walter
murie
yet
she
loved
him
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
many
letters
she
had
addressed
to
him
in
his
travels
had
remained
unanswered
this
had
in
a
measure
piqued
her
but
she
was
in
ignorance
that
much
of
his
correspondence
and
hers
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
her
ladyship
and
been
destroyed
as
they
walked
on
talking
as
lovers
will
she
was
thinking
deeply
and
full
of
regret
that
she
dared
not
tell
the
truth
to
this
man
who
loving
her
so
fondly
would
she
knew
be
prepared
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
her
sake
suppose
he
knew
the
truth
whatever
sacrifice
he
made
would
alas
not
alter
facts
if
she
confessed
he
would
only
hate
her
ah
the
tragedy
of
it
all
therefore
she
held
her
silence
she
dared
not
speak
lest
she
might
lose
his
love
she
had
no
friend
in
whom
she
could
confide
from
her
own
father
even
she
was
compelled
to
hide
the
actual
facts
they
were
too
terrible
what
would
he
think
if
the
bitter
truth
were
exposed
the
man
at
her
side
tall
brave
strong
a
lover
whom
she
knew
many
girls
coveted
believed
that
he
was
to
marry
her
but
she
told
herself
within
her
heart
such
a
thing
could
never
be
a
barrier
stood
between
them
invisible
yet
nevertheless
one
that
might
for
ever
debar
their
mutual
happiness
an
involuntary
sigh
escaped
her
and
he
inquired
the
reason
she
excused
herself
by
saying
that
it
was
owing
to
the
exertion
of
walking
over
the
rough
path
therefore
they
halted
and
with
the
bright
summer
moonbeams
falling
upon
her
beautiful
countenance
he
kissed
her
passionately
upon
the
lips
again
and
yet
again
they
remained
together
for
over
an
hour
moving
along
slowly
heedless
of
where
their
footsteps
led
them
heedless
too
of
being
seen
by
any
of
the
keepers
who
at
night
usually
patrolled
the
estate
their
walk
however
lay
at
the
farther
end
of
the
glen
in
the
coverts
remote
from
the
house
and
nearer
the
therefore
there
was
but
little
danger
of
being
observed
many
were
the
pledges
of
affection
they
exchanged
before
parting
on
walter
part
they
were
fervent
and
passionate
but
on
the
part
of
his
idol
they
were
alas
only
the
pretence
of
a
happiness
which
she
feared
could
never
be
permanent
presently
they
retraced
their
steps
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
beyond
which
lay
the
house
they
found
the
path
and
there
at
her
request
he
left
her
it
was
not
wise
that
he
should
approach
the
house
at
that
hour
she
urged
so
after
a
long
and
fervent
he
held
her
in
a
last
embrace
and
then
raising
his
cap
and
saying
my
darling
my
own
he
turned
away
and
went
at
a
swinging
pace
down
the
where
he
had
left
his
car
with
lights
extinguished
she
watched
him
disappear
then
sighing
she
turned
into
the
dark
winding
path
beneath
the
trees
the
end
of
which
came
out
upon
the
drive
close
to
the
house
down
however
with
sudden
resolve
she
took
a
narrower
path
to
the
left
and
was
soon
on
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
and
out
again
in
the
bright
moonlight
the
night
was
so
glorious
that
she
had
resolved
to
stroll
alone
to
think
and
devise
some
plan
for
the
future
before
her
silhouetted
high
against
the
steely
sky
rose
the
two
great
black
towers
of
the
ancient
castle
the
grim
crumbling
walls
stood
dark
and
frowning
amid
the
scene
while
from
far
below
came
up
the
faint
rippling
of
the
ruthven
water
a
great
owl
flapped
lazily
from
the
ivy
as
she
approached
those
historic
old
walls
which
in
bygone
days
had
held
within
them
some
of
scotland
greatest
men
she
had
explored
and
knew
every
nook
and
cranny
in
those
extensive
ruins
with
assistance
she
had
once
made
a
perilous
ascent
to
the
top
of
the
highest
of
the
two
square
towers
and
had
often
clambered
along
the
broken
walls
of
the
keep
or
descended
into
those
strange
little
subterranean
chambers
now
with
earth
and
rubbish
which
tradition
declared
were
the
dungeons
in
which
prisoners
in
the
old
days
had
been
put
to
the
rack
seared
with
irons
or
submitted
to
other
horrible
tortures
her
feet
falling
noiselessly
she
entered
the
courtyard
where
stood
the
ancient
spreading
yew
the
under
which
the
glencardine
charters
had
been
signed
and
justice
administered
other
big
trees
had
sprung
from
seedlings
since
the
place
had
fallen
into
ruin
and
having
entered
she
paused
amidst
its
weird
impressive
silence
those
high
ponderous
walls
about
her
spoke
mutely
of
strength
and
impregnability
those
mounds
hid
ruined
walls
and
broken
foundations
what
tales
of
wild
lawlessness
and
reckless
bloodshed
they
all
could
tell
many
of
the
strange
stories
she
had
heard
concerning
the
old
place
stories
told
by
the
people
in
the
neighbourhood
were
recalled
as
she
stood
there
gazing
wonderingly
about
her
many
romantic
legends
had
indeed
been
handed
down
in
perthshire
from
generation
to
generation
concerning
old
glencardine
and
its
lawless
masters
and
for
her
they
had
always
possessed
a
strange
fascination
for
had
she
not
inherited
the
antiquarian
tastes
of
her
father
and
had
she
not
read
many
works
upon
folklore
and
subjects
suddenly
while
standing
in
the
deep
shadow
gazing
thoughtfully
up
at
those
high
towers
which
though
ruined
still
guarded
the
end
of
the
glen
a
strange
thing
occurred
something
which
startled
her
causing
her
to
halt
breathless
petrified
rooted
to
the
spot
she
stared
straight
before
her
something
uncanny
was
happening
there
something
that
was
indeed
beyond
human
credence
and
quite
inexplicable
chapter
xi
concerns
the
whispers
what
had
startled
gabrielle
was
certainly
extraordinary
and
decidedly
uncanny
she
was
standing
near
the
southern
wall
when
of
a
sudden
she
heard
low
but
distinct
whispers
again
she
listened
yes
the
sounds
were
not
due
to
her
excited
imagination
at
the
recollection
of
those
romantic
traditions
of
love
and
hatred
or
of
those
gruesome
stories
of
how
the
wolf
of
badenoch
had
been
kept
prisoner
there
for
five
years
and
put
to
frightful
tortures
or
how
the
laird
of
weem
was
deliberately
poisoned
in
that
old
the
huge
open
fireplace
of
which
still
existed
near
where
she
stood
there
was
the
distinct
sound
of
low
whispered
words
she
held
her
breath
to
listen
she
tried
to
distinguish
what
the
words
were
but
in
vain
then
she
endeavoured
to
determine
whence
they
emanated
but
was
unable
to
do
so
again
they
sounded
again
and
yet
again
then
there
was
another
voice
still
low
still
whispering
but
not
quite
so
deep
as
the
first
it
sounded
like
a
woman
local
tradition
had
it
that
the
place
held
the
ghosts
of
those
who
had
died
in
agony
within
its
noisome
dungeons
but
she
had
always
been
far
too
to
accept
stories
of
the
supernatural
yet
at
that
moment
her
ears
did
not
deceive
her
that
pile
of
grim
gaunt
ruins
was
a
house
of
whispers
again
she
listened
never
moving
a
muscle
an
owl
hooted
weirdly
in
the
ivy
far
above
her
while
near
at
her
feet
a
rabbit
scuttled
away
through
the
grass
such
noises
she
was
used
to
she
knew
every
of
the
for
when
she
had
finished
her
work
in
the
library
she
often
went
unknown
to
the
household
with
stewart
upon
his
nocturnal
rounds
and
walked
miles
through
the
woods
in
the
night
the
was
her
particular
favourite
he
knew
so
much
of
natural
history
and
he
taught
her
all
he
knew
she
could
distinguish
the
cries
of
birds
in
the
night
and
could
tell
by
certain
sounds
made
by
them
as
they
were
disturbed
that
no
other
intruders
were
in
the
vicinity
but
that
weird
whispering
coming
as
it
did
from
an
undiscovered
source
was
inhuman
and
utterly
uncanny
was
it
possible
that
her
ears
had
deceived
her
was
it
one
of
the
omens
believed
in
by
the
superstitious
the
wall
whence
the
voices
appeared
to
emanate
was
she
knew
about
seven
feet
thick
an
outer
wall
of
the
old
keep
she
was
aware
of
this
because
in
one
of
the
folio
tomes
in
the
library
was
a
picture
of
the
castle
as
it
appeared
in
taken
from
some
manuscript
of
that
period
preserved
in
the
british
museum
she
who
had
explored
the
ruins
dozens
of
times
knew
well
that
at
the
point
where
she
was
standing
there
could
be
no
place
of
concealment
beyond
that
wall
the
hill
covered
with
bushes
and
brushwood
descended
sheer
for
three
hundred
feet
or
so
to
the
bottom
of
the
glen
had
the
voices
sounded
from
one
or
other
of
the
chambers
which
remained
more
or
less
intact
she
would
not
have
been
so
puzzled
but
as
it
was
the
weird
whisperings
seemed
to
come
forth
from
space
sometimes
they
sounded
so
low
that
she
could
scarcely
hear
them
at
others
they
were
so
loud
that
she
could
almost
distinguish
the
words
uttered
by
the
unseen
was
it
merely
a
phenomenon
caused
by
the
wind
blowing
through
some
crack
in
the
ponderous
wall
she
looked
beyond
at
the
great
dark
yew
the
of
the
grahams
the
night
was
perfectly
calm
not
a
leaf
stirred
either
upon
that
or
upon
the
other
trees
the
ivy
high
above
and
exposed
to
the
slightest
breath
of
a
breeze
was
motionless
only
the
going
and
coming
of
the
moved
it
no
she
decided
once
and
for
all
that
the
noise
was
that
of
voices
spectral
voices
though
they
might
be
again
she
strained
her
eyes
when
still
again
those
soft
sibilant
whisperings
sounded
weird
and
quite
inexplicable
slowly
and
with
greatest
caution
she
moved
along
beneath
the
wall
but
as
she
did
so
she
seemed
to
recede
from
the
sound
so
back
she
went
to
the
spot
where
she
had
previously
stood
and
there
again
remained
listening
there
were
two
distinct
voices
at
least
that
was
the
conclusion
at
which
she
arrived
after
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
most
minute
investigation
once
she
fancied
in
her
excitement
that
away
in
the
farther
corner
of
the
ruined
courtyard
she
saw
a
slowly
moving
form
like
a
thin
column
of
mist
was
it
the
lady
of
glencardine
the
apparition
of
the
hapless
lady
jane
glencardine
but
on
closer
inspection
she
decided
that
it
was
merely
due
to
her
own
distorted
imagination
and
dismissed
it
from
her
mind
those
low
curious
whisperings
alone
puzzled
her
they
were
certainly
not
sounds
that
could
be
made
by
any
rodents
within
the
walls
because
they
were
voices
distinctly
and
indisputably
which
at
some
moments
were
raised
in
argument
and
then
fell
away
into
sounds
of
indistinct
murmuring
whence
did
they
come
she
again
moved
noiselessly
from
place
to
place
at
length
deciding
that
only
at
one
point
the
point
where
she
had
first
stood
could
the
sounds
be
heard
distinctly
so
to
that
spot
once
more
the
girl
returned
standing
there
like
a
statue
her
ears
strained
for
every
sound
waiting
and
wondering
but
the
whispers
had
now
ceased
in
the
distance
the
chimed
two
yet
she
remained
at
her
post
determined
to
solve
the
mystery
and
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
those
weird
stories
which
the
in
the
highlands
so
entirely
believed
no
ghost
of
whatever
form
could
frighten
her
she
told
herself
she
had
never
believed
in
omens
or
superstitions
and
she
steeled
herself
not
to
believe
in
them
now
so
she
remained
there
in
patience
seeking
some
natural
solution
of
the
extraordinary
enigma
but
though
she
waited
until
the
chimes
rang
out
three
and
the
moon
was
going
down
she
heard
no
other
sound
the
whispers
had
suddenly
ended
and
the
silence
of
those
gaunt
frowning
old
walls
was
undisturbed
a
slight
wind
had
now
sprung
up
sweeping
across
the
hills
and
causing
her
to
feel
chill
therefore
at
last
she
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
quit
her
post
of
observation
and
retrace
her
steps
by
the
rough
byroad
to
the
house
entering
by
one
of
the
windows
of
the
of
which
the
was
broken
and
which
on
many
occasions
she
had
unfastened
after
her
nocturnal
rambles
with
stewart
indeed
concealed
under
the
walls
she
kept
an
old
rusted
and
by
its
aid
it
was
her
habit
to
push
back
the
catch
and
so
gain
entrance
after
reconcealing
the
knife
for
use
on
a
future
occasion
on
reaching
her
own
room
she
stood
for
a
few
moments
reflecting
deeply
upon
her
remarkable
and
inexplicable
discovery
had
the
story
of
those
whisperings
been
told
to
her
she
would
certainly
have
scouted
them
but
she
had
heard
them
with
her
own
ears
and
was
certain
that
she
had
not
been
deceived
it
was
a
mystery
absolute
and
complete
and
regarding
it
as
such
she
retired
to
bed
but
her
thoughts
were
very
naturally
full
of
the
weird
story
told
of
the
dead
and
gone
owners
of
glencardine
she
recollected
that
horrible
story
of
the
ghaist
of
manse
and
of
the
spectre
of
bridgend
in
the
library
she
had
a
year
ago
discovered
a
strange
old
book
one
which
sixty
years
before
had
been
in
universal
circulation
entitled
invisible
world
and
she
had
read
it
from
beginning
to
end
this
book
had
perhaps
more
influence
upon
the
country
people
in
scotland
than
any
other
work
it
consisted
entirely
of
relations
of
ghosts
of
murdered
persons
witches
warlocks
and
fairies
and
as
it
was
read
as
an
indoor
amusement
in
the
presence
of
children
and
followed
up
by
unfounded
tales
of
the
same
description
the
youngsters
were
afraid
to
turn
round
in
case
they
might
be
grasped
by
the
old
one
so
strong
indeed
became
this
impression
that
even
people
would
not
venture
through
fear
into
another
room
or
down
a
stair
after
nightfall
her
experience
in
the
old
castle
had
to
say
the
least
been
remarkable
those
weird
whisperings
were
extraordinary
for
hours
she
lay
reflecting
upon
the
many
traditions
of
the
old
place
some
recorded
in
the
historic
notices
of
the
house
of
the
montrose
and
others
which
had
gathered
from
local
sources
the
farmers
of
the
neighbourhood
the
keepers
and
servants
those
noises
in
the
night
were
mysterious
and
puzzling
next
morning
she
went
alone
to
the
kennels
to
find
stewart
and
to
question
him
he
had
told
her
many
weird
stories
and
traditions
of
the
old
place
and
it
struck
her
that
he
might
be
able
to
furnish
her
with
some
information
regarding
her
strange
discovery
had
anyone
else
heard
those
whispers
besides
herself
she
wondered
she
met
several
of
the
guests
but
assiduously
avoided
them
until
at
last
she
saw
the
thin
keeper
going
towards
his
cottage
with
dash
the
faithful
old
spaniel
at
his
heels
when
she
hailed
him
he
touched
his
cap
respectfully
changed
his
gun
to
the
other
arm
and
wished
her
miss
gabrielle
in
his
strong
scotch
accent
she
bade
him
put
down
his
gun
and
walk
with
her
up
the
hill
towards
the
ruins
look
here
stewart
she
commanded
in
a
confidential
tone

what
he
said
he
was
not
endeavouring
to
alarm
her
unduly
but
thoroughly
believed
in
supernatural
agencies
i
suppose
you
already
examined
the
ruins
thoroughly
eh
she
asked
at
last
examined
them
echoed
the
man
i
should
think
sae
aifter
years
here
why
as
a
laddie
i
used
to
play
there
ilka
day
an
been
in
ilka
neuk
an
cranny
nevertheless
come
up
now
with
me
she
said
i
want
to
explain
to
you
exactly
where
and
how
i
heard
the
voices
the
whispers
are
an
uncanny
thing
said
the
keeper
with
his
broad
accent
i
dinna
like
them
miss
i
dinna
like
tae
hear
what
ye
tell
me
ava
oh
do
worry
about
me
stewart
she
laughed
i
not
afraid
of
any
omen
i
only
mean
to
fathom
the
mystery
and
i
want
your
assistance
in
doing
so
but
of
course
you
say
no
word
to
a
soul
remember
that
if
it
be
yer
wush
miss
gabrielle
i
say
naething
he
promised
and
together
they
descended
the
steep
and
overgrown
foundations
of
the
castle
until
they
stood
in
the
old
courtyard
close
to
the
ancient
the
exact
spot
where
the
girl
had
stood
on
the
previous
night
i
could
hear
plainly
as
i
stood
just
here
she
said
the
sound
of
voices
seemed
to
come
from
that
wall
there
and
she
pointed
to
the
gray
flint
wall
with
ivy
about
six
yards
away
stewart
made
no
remark
it
was
not
the
first
occasion
on
which
he
had
examined
that
place
in
an
attempt
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
nocturnal
whisperings
he
walked
across
to
the
wall
tapping
it
with
his
hand
while
the
faithful
spaniel
began
sniffing
in
expectancy
of
something
to
bolt
there
naething
here
miss
absolutely
naething
he
declared
as
they
both
examined
the
wall
minutely
its
depth
did
not
admit
of
any
chamber
for
it
was
an
inner
wall
and
according
to
the
statement
he
had
already
tested
it
years
ago
and
found
it
solid
masonry
if
i
went
forward
or
backward
then
the
sounds
were
lost
to
me
gabrielle
explained
much
puzzled
ay
that
juist
what
they
a
said
remarked
the
keeper
with
an
apprehensive
look
upon
his
face
the
whispers
are
only
at
ae
spot
whaur
ye
juist
stood
i
seen
the
lady
a
in
green
masel
miss
aince
when
i
was
a
laddie
an
again
aboot
ten
year
syne
you
mean
stewart
that
you
imagined
that
you
saw
an
apparition
you
were
alone
i
suppose
yes
miss
i
was
alane
well
you
thought
you
saw
the
lady
of
glencardine
where
was
she
on
the
drive
in
front
o
the
hoose
perhaps
somebody
played
a
practical
joke
on
you
the
green
lady
is
glencardine
favourite
spectre
is
she
perfectly
harmless
i
mean
ay
miss
lots
o
folk
saw
her
ten
year
syne
but
nooadays
she
seems
to
been
laid
somebody
said
they
saw
her
last
glesca
holidays
but
i
dinna
believe
neither
do
i
stewart
but
do
let
trouble
about
the
unfortunate
lady
who
ought
to
have
been
at
rest
long
ago
it
those
weird
whisperings
i
mean
to
investigate
and
she
looked
blankly
around
her
at
the
great
cyclopean
walls
and
high
towers
gaunt
yet
picturesque
in
the
morning
sunshine
the
keeper
shook
his
shaggy
head
i
afear
miss
gabrielle
that
ye
solve
the
mystery
there
somethin
sae
fatal
aboot
the
whisperin
he
said
speaking
in
his
pleasant
highland
tongue
that
naebody
cares
tae
attempt
the
investigation
they
div
say
that
the
whispers
are
the
voice
o
the
himsel
the
girl
in
her
short
blue
serge
skirt
white
cotton
blouse
and
blue
laughed
at
the
man
dread
there
must
be
a
distinct
cause
for
this
noise
she
had
heard
she
argued
yet
though
they
both
spent
wandering
among
the
ruins
standing
in
the
roofless
banqueting
hall
and
traversing
stone
corridors
and
ruined
chambers
choked
with
weeds
their
efforts
to
obtain
any
clue
were
all
in
vain
to
gabrielle
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
old
keeper
regarded
the
incident
of
the
previous
night
as
a
fatal
omen
for
he
was
most
solicitous
of
her
welfare
he
went
so
far
as
to
crave
permission
to
go
to
sir
henry
and
put
the
whole
of
the
mysterious
facts
before
him
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
she
meant
to
solve
the
mystery
herself
if
her
father
learnt
of
the
affair
and
of
the
connected
with
it
the
matter
would
surely
cause
him
great
uneasiness
why
should
he
be
worried
on
her
account
no
she
would
never
allow
it
and
told
stewart
plainly
of
her
disapproval
of
such
a
course
but
tell
me
she
asked
at
last
as
returning
to
the
courtyard
they
stood
together
at
the
spot
where
she
had
stood
in
that
moonlit
hour
and
heard
with
her
own
ears
those
weird
mysterious
voices
coming
from
nowhere
tell
me
stewart
is
there
any
legend
connected
with
the
whispers
have
you
ever
heard
any
story
concerning
their
origin
of
coorse
miss
through
all
perthshire
it
weel
kent
replied
the
man
slowly
not
it
seemed
without
considerable
reluctance
what
is
by
those
doomed
tae
daith
is
the
conspiracy
o
charles
lord
glencardine
an
the
earl
o
kintyre
for
the
murder
o
the
infamous
cardinal
setoun
o
andrews
wha
as
i
dare
say

fra
history

was
assassinated
here
on
this
very
spot

a
year
later
tried
by
a
commission
issued
under
the
name
o
mary
queen
o
scots
but
sae
popular
was
the
murder
o
the
cardinal
that
the
accused
were
acquitted
yes
exclaimed
the
girl
i
remember
reading
something
about
it
in
scottish
history
and
the
whispers
are
i
suppose
said
to
be
the
ghostly
conspirators
in
conclave
that
what
folk
say
miss
they
div
say
as
weel
that
auld
nick
was
present
an
gied
the
decision
that
the
cardinal
wha
was
to
be
askit
ower
frae
stirlin

dee
it
is
his
evil
counsel
that
is
by
those
whom
death
will
quickly
overtake
really
stewart
she
laughed
you
make
me
feel
quite
uncomfortable
but
miss
sir
henry
already
kens
a
aboot
the
whispers
said
the
man
i
him
tellin
a
young
gentleman
wha
cam

last
season
a
guid
dale
aboot
it
they
veesited
the
auld
castle
thegither
an
i
happened
tae
be
hereaboots
this
caused
the
girl
to
resolve
to
learn
from
her
father
what
she
could
he
was
an
antiquary
and
had
the
history
of
glencardine
at
his
so
presently
she
strolled
back
to
stewart
cottage
and
after
receiving
from
the
faithful
servant
urgent
injunctions
to
have
a
care
of
herself
she
walked
on
to
the
where
shaded
by
the
high
trees
lady
heyburn
in
white
serge
and
three
of
her
male
guests
were
playing
father
she
said
that
same
evening
when
they
had
settled
down
to
commence
work
upon
those
documents
from
paris
what
was
the
cause
of
glencardine
becoming
a
ruin
well
the
reason
of
its
downfall
was
lord
glencardine
change
of
front
he
answered
in
he
became
a
stalwart
supporter
of
episcopacy
and
divine
right
a
course
which
proved
equally
fatal
to
himself
and
to
his
ancient
castle
of
glencardine
reid
in
his
of
relates
how
after
the
civil
war
lord
dundrennan
in
company
with
his
cousin
george
lochan
of
ochiltree
and
burgess
of
auchterarder
and
the
laird
of
descended
into
strathearn
and
occupied
the
castle
with
about
fifty
men
he
hurriedly
put
it
into
a
state
of
defence
general
overton
besieged
the
place
in
person
with
his
army
consisting
of
eighteen
hundred
foot
and
eleven
hundred
horse
and
battered
the
walls
with
cannon
having
brought
a
number
of
great
ordnance
from
stirling
castle
for
ten
days
the
castle
was
held
by
the
small
but
resolute
garrison
and
might
have
held
out
longer
had
not
the
well
failed
with
the
prospect
of
death
before
them
in
the
event
of
the
place
being
taken
dundrennan
and
lochan
contrived
to
break
through
the
enemy
who
surrounded
the
castle
on
all
sides
a
page
of
the
name
of
john
hamilton
in
attendance
upon
lord
dundrennan
well
acquainted
with
the
localities
of
glencardine
undertook
to
be
their
guide
when
the
moon
was
down
dundrennan
and
lochan
issued
from
the
castle
by
a
small
postern
where
they
found
hamilton
waiting
for
them
with
three
horses
they
mounted
and
passing
quietly
through
the
enemy
force
they
escaped
and
reached
lord
glencardine
in
safety
to
the
north
on
the
morning
after
their
escape
the
castle
was
surrendered
and
of
the
garrison
were
sent
to
the
tolbooth
of
edinburgh
general
overton
ordered
the
remaining
twelve
of
those
who
had
surrendered
to
be
shot
at
a
post
and
the
castle
to
be
burned
which
was
accordingly
done
the
in
the
neighbourhood
are
full
of
strange
stories
about
ghostly
whisperings
being
heard
in
the
castle
ruins
she
remarked
her
father
started
and
raising
his
expressionless
face
to
hers
asked
in
almost
a
snappish
tone
well
and
who
has
heard
them
now
pray
several
people
i
believe
and
they
gossiping
as
usual
eh
he
remarked
in
a
hard
dry
tone
up
here
in
the
highlands
they
are
ridiculously
superstitious
been
telling
you
about
the
whispers
child
oh
i
learnt
of
them
from
several
people
she
replied
evasively
mysterious
voices
were
heard
they
say
last
night
and
for
several
nights
previously
it
also
a
local
tradition
that
all
those
who
hear
the
whispered
warning
die
within
forty
days
bosh
my
dear
utter
rubbish
the
old
man
laughed
who
been
trying
to
frighten
you
nobody
dad
i
merely
tell
you
what
the
country
people
say
yes
he
remarked
i
know
the
story
is
a
gruesome
one
and
in
the
highlands
a
story
is
not
attractive
unless
it
has
some
fatality
in
it
up
here
the
belief
in
demonology
and
witchcraft
has
died
very
hard
get
down
penny
of
first
shelf
to
the
left
beyond
the
second
window
corner
it
will
explain
to
you
how
very
superstitious
the
people
have
ever
been
i
know
all
that
dad
persisted
the
girl
but
i
interested
in
this
extraordinary
story
of
the
whispers
you
as
an
antiquary
have
no
doubt
investigated
all
the
legendary
lore
connected
with
glencardine
the
people
declare
that
the
whispers
are
heard
and
i
am
told
believe
some
extraordinary
theory
regarding
them
a
theory
he
exclaimed
quickly
what
theory
what
has
been
discovered
nothing
as
far
as
i
know
no
and
nothing
ever
will
be
discovered
he
said
why
not
dad
she
asked
do
you
deny
that
strange
noises
are
heard
there
when
there
is
so
much
evidence
in
the
affirmative
i
really
do
know
my
dear
i
never
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
them
myself
though
i
been
told
of
them
ever
since
i
bought
the
place
but
there
is
a
legend
which
is
supposed
to
account
for
them
is
there
not
dad
do
tell
me
what
you
know
she
urged
i
so
very
much
interested
in
the
old
place
and
its
bygone
history
the
less
you
know
concerning
the
whispers
the
better
my
dear
he
replied
abruptly
her
father
ominous
words
surprised
her
did
he
too
believe
in
the
fatal
omen
though
he
was
trying
to
mislead
her
and
poke
fun
at
the
local
superstition
but
why
should
i
know
she
protested
this
is
the
first
time
dad
that
you
tried
to
withhold
from
me
any
antiquarian
knowledge
that
you
possess
besides
the
story
of
glencardine
and
its
lords
is
intensely
fascinating
to
me
so
might
be
the
whispers
if
ever
you
had
the
misfortune
to
hear
them
misfortune
she
gasped
turning
pale
why
do
you
say
misfortune
but
he
laughed
a
strange
hollow
laugh
and
endeavouring
to
turn
his
seriousness
into
humour
said
well
they
might
give
you
a
turn
perhaps
they
would
make
me
start
i
feel
sure
from
what
i
been
told
they
seem
to
come
from
nowhere
it
is
practically
an
unseen
spectre
who
has
the
rather
unusual
gift
of
speech
it
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
explain
how
on
the
previous
night
she
had
actually
listened
to
the
whispers
but
she
refrained
she
recognised
that
though
he
would
not
admit
it
he
was
nevertheless
superstitious
of
ill
results
following
the
hearing
of
those
weird
whisperings
so
she
made
eager
pretence
of
wishing
to
know
the
historical
facts
of
the
incident
referred
to
by
the
gamekeeper
no
exclaimed
the
blind
man
softly
but
firmly
taking
her
hand
and
stroking
her
arm
tenderly
as
was
his
habit
when
he
wished
to
persuade
her
no
gabrielle
dear
he
said
we
will
change
the
subject
now
do
not
bother
your
head
about
absurd
country
legends
of
that
sort
there
are
so
many
concerning
glencardine
and
its
lords
that
a
whole
volume
might
be
filled
with
them
but
i
want
to
know
all
about
this
particular
one
dad
she
said
from
me
you
will
never
know
my
dear
was
his
answer
as
his
gray
serious
face
was
upturned
to
hers
you
have
never
heard
the
whispers
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
you
never
will
chapter

what
flockart
foresaw
the
following
afternoon
was
glaring
and
breathless
gabrielle
had
taken
stokes
with
may
spencer
a
girl
friend
visiting
her
mother
and
driven
the
sixteen
over
to
connachan
with
a
message
from
her
mother
an
invitation
to
lady
murie
and
her
party
to
luncheon
and
tennis
on
the
following
day
it
was
three
the
hour
when
silence
is
upon
a
summer
in
the
country
beneath
the
blazing
sun
glencardine
lay
amid
its
its
cut
and
its
bowers
of
greenery
the
palpitating
heat
was
terrible
the
hottest
day
that
summer
at
the
end
of
the
long
handsome
with
its
pale
blue
carpet
and
furniture
lady
heyburn
was
lolling
lazily
in
her
chair
near
the
wide
bright
steel
grate
with
her
inseparable
friend
james
flockart
standing
before
her
the
striped
blinds
outside
the
three
long
open
windows
subdued
the
yet
the
very
odour
of
the
cut
flowers
in
the
room
seemed
oppressive
while
without
could
be
heard
the
busy
hum
of
insect
life
the
baronet
handsome
wife
looked
cool
and
comfortable
in
her
gown
of
white
embroidered
muslin
her
head
thrown
back
upon
the
silken
cushion
and
her
eyes
raised
to
those
of
the
man
who
was
idly
smoking
a
cigarette
at
her
side
the
thing
grows
more
and
more
inexplicable
he
was
saying
to
her
in
a
low
strained
voice
all
the
inquiries
i
caused
to
be
made
in
london
and
in
paris
have
led
to
a
negative
result
we
shall
only
know
the
truth
when
we
get
a
peep
of
those
papers
in
henry
safe
my
dear
friend
was
the
woman
reply
and
that
a
pretty
difficult
job
you
do
know
where
the
old
fellow
keeps
the
key
i
only
wish
i
did
gabrielle
knows
no
doubt
then
you
ought
to
compel
her
to
divulge
he
urged
once
we
get
hold
of
that
key
for
we
could
learn
a
lot
a
lot
that
would
be
useful
to
you
eh
remarked
the
woman
with
a
meaning
smile
and
to
you
also
he
said
could
we
somehow
watch
and
see
where
he
hides
the
he
never
has
it
upon
him
you
say
it
is
on
his
bunch
then
he
must
have
a
for
it
or
it
may
be
on
his
remarked
the
man
decisively
get
rid
of
all
the
guests
as
quickly
as
you
can
winnie
while
they
about
there
always
a
danger
of
eavesdroppers
and
of
watchers
i
already
announced
that
i
going
up
to
inverness
next
week
so
within
the
next
day
or
two
our
friends
will
all
leave
good
then
the
ground
will
be
cleared
for
action
he
remarked
blowing
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
his
lips
what
your
decision
regarding
the
girl
the
same
as
yours
but
she
hates
me
you
know
laughed
the
man
in
gray
flannel
yes
but
she
fears
you
at
the
same
time
and
with
her
you
can
do
more
by
fear
than
by
love
true
but
she
got
a
spirit
of
her
own
recollect
that
must
be
broken
and
what
about
walter
oh
as
soon
as
he
finds
out
the
truth
he
drop
her
never
fear
already
rather
fond
of
that
tall
dark
girl
of
dundas
you
saw
her
at
the
ball
you
recollect
her
flockart
grunted
he
was
assisting
this
woman
at
his
side
to
play
a
desperate
game
this
was
not
however
the
first
occasion
on
which
they
had
acted
in
conjunction
in
matters
that
were
not
altogether
honourable
there
had
never
been
any
question
of
affection
between
them
the
pair
regarded
each
other
from
a
purely
business
standpoint
people
might
gossip
as
much
as
ever
they
liked
but
the
two
always
congratulated
themselves
that
they
had
never
committed
the
supreme
folly
of
falling
in
love
with
each
other
the
woman
had
married
sir
henry
merely
in
order
to
obtain
money
and
position
and
this
man
flockart
who
for
years
had
been
her
most
intimate
associate
had
ever
remained
behind
her
to
advise
and
to
help
her
perhaps
had
the
baronet
not
been
afflicted
he
would
have
disapproved
of
this
constant
companionship
for
he
would
no
doubt
have
overheard
in
society
certain
which
though
utterly
unfounded
would
not
have
been
exactly
pleasant
but
as
he
was
blind
and
never
went
into
society
he
remained
in
blissful
ignorance
wrapped
up
in
his
mysterious
business
and
his
hobbies
gabrielle
on
her
return
from
school
had
at
first
accepted
flockart
as
her
friend
it
was
he
who
took
her
for
walks
who
taught
her
to
cast
a
fly
to
shoot
rooks
and
to
play
the
national
winter
game
of
scotland
curling
he
had
in
the
first
few
months
of
her
return
home
done
everything
in
his
power
to
attract
the
young
girl
friendship
while
at
the
same
time
her
ladyship
showed
herself
extraordinarily
well
disposed
towards
her
within
a
year
however
by
reason
of
various
remarks
made
by
people
in
her
presence
and
on
account
of
the
cold
disdain
with
which
lady
heyburn
treated
her
afflicted
father
vague
suspicions
were
aroused
within
her
suspicions
which
gradually
grew
to
hatred
until
she
clung
to
her
father
and
as
his
eyes
and
ears
took
up
a
position
of
open
defiance
towards
her
mother
and
her
adventurous
friend
the
situation
each
day
grew
more
and
more
strained
lady
heyburn
was
even
though
of
humble
origin
a
woman
of
unusual
intelligence
in
various
quarters
she
had
been
snubbed
and
ridiculed
but
she
gradually
managed
in
every
case
to
get
the
better
of
her
enemies
many
a
man
and
many
a
woman
had
had
bitter
cause
to
repent
their
enmity
towards
her
they
marvelled
how
their
secrets
became
known
to
her
they
did
not
know
the
power
behind
her
the
sinister
power
of
that
ingenious
and
unscrupulous
man
james
flockart
the
man
who
made
it
his
business
to
know
other
people
secrets
though
for
years
he
had
been
seized
with
a
desire
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
sir
henry
private
affairs
he
had
never
succeeded
the
old
baronet
was
essentially
a
recluse
he
kept
himself
so
much
to
himself
and
was
so
careful
that
no
eyes
save
those
of
his
daughter
should
see
the
mysterious
documents
which
came
to
him
so
regularly
by
registered
post
that
all
efforts
and
those
of
lady
heyburn
had
been
futile
i
had
another
good
look
at
the
safe
this
morning
the
man
went
on
presently
it
is
one
of
the
best
makes
and
would
resist
anything
except
of
course
the
electric
current
to
force
it
would
be
to
put
henry
on
his
guard
lady
heyburn
remarked
if
we
are
to
know
what
secrets
are
there
and
use
our
knowledge
for
our
own
benefit
we
must
open
it
with
a
key
and
relock
it
well
winnie
we
must
do
something
we
must
both
have
money
quite
evident
he
said
that
last
five
hundred
you
gave
me
will
stave
off
ruin
for
a
week
or
so
but
after
that
we
must
certainly
be
well
supplied
or
else
there
may
be
revelations
well
which
will
be
as
ugly
for
yourself
as
for
me
i
know
she
exclaimed
i
fully
realise
the
necessity
of
getting
funds
the
other
affair
though
we
worked
it
so
well
proved
a
miserable
fiasco
and
very
nearly
gave
us
away
into
the
bargain
he
declared
i
tell
you
frankly
winnie
that
if
we
ca
pay
a
level
five
thousand
in
three
weeks
time
the
truth
will
be
out
and
you
know
what
that
will
mean
he
was
watching
her
handsome
face
as
he
spoke
and
he
noticed
how
pale
and
drawn
were
her
features
as
he
referred
to
certain
ugly
truths
that
might
leak
out
yes
she
gasped
i
know
james
we
both
find
ourselves
under
arrest
such
a
is
really
too
terrible
to
think
of
but
my
dear
girl
it
must
be
faced
he
said
if
we
do
get
the
money
ca
you
work
sir
henry
for
a
bit
more
say
another
thousand
make
an
excuse
that
you
have
bills
to
pay
in
london
dressmakers
jewellers
milliners
any
good
story
will
surely
do
he
gives
you
anything
you
ask
for
she
shook
her
head
and
sighed
i
fear
i
imposed
upon
his
far
too
much
already
she
answered
i
know
i
extravagant
i
sorry
but
ca
help
it
born
in
me
i
suppose
a
few
months
ago
he
found
out
that
i
been
paying
mellish
a
hundred
pounds
each
time
to
decorate
park
street
with
flowers
for
my
wednesday
evenings
and
he
created
an
awful
scene
he
getting
horribly
stingy
of
late
yes
but
the
flowers
were
a
bit
expensive
were
they
he
remarked
not
at
all
lady
fortrose
the
wife
of
the
pays
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
for
flowers
for
her
house
every
thursday
in
the
season
and
mine
looked
quite
as
good
as
hers
i
think
mellish
is
much
cheaper
than
anybody
else
and
just
because
i
went
to
a
cheap
man
henry
was
horrible
he
said
all
sorts
of
weird
things
about
my
reckless
extravagance
and
the
suffering
poor
as
though
i
had
anything
to
do
with
them
the
genuine
poor
are
really
people
like
you
and
me
i
know
he
said
philosophically
lighting
another
cigarette
but
all
this
is
beside
the
point
we
want
money
and
money
we
must
have
in
order
to
avoid
exposure
you
i
was
a
fool
to
have
had
anything
to
do
with
that
other
little
affair
she
interrupted
it
was
not
only
myself
who
arranged
it
remember
it
was
you
who
suggested
it
because
it
seemed
so
easy
and
because
you
had
an
old
score
to
pay
off
the
woman
was
sacrificed
and
at
the
same
time
an
enemy
learnt
our
secret
i
could
help
it
he
protested
you
let
your
woman
vindictiveness
overstep
your
natural
caution
my
dear
girl
if
you
taken
my
advice
there
would
have
been
no
suspicion
lady
heyburn
was
silent
she
sat
regarding
the
toe
of
her
shoe
fixedly
in
deep
reflection
she
was
powerless
to
protest
she
was
so
entirely
in
this
man
hands
well
she
asked
at
last
stirring
uneasily
in
her
chair
and
suppose
we
are
not
able
to
raise
the
money
what
do
you
anticipate
will
be
the
result
a
rapid
reprisal
was
his
answer
people
like
them
hesitate
they
act
yes
i
see
she
remarked
in
a
blank
voice
they
have
nothing
to
lose
so
they
will
bring
pressure
upon
us
just
as
we
once
tried
to
bring
pressure
upon
them
it
all
a
matter
of
money
we
pay
the
price
arranged
a
mere
matter
of
business
but
how
are
we
to
get
money
by
getting
a
glance
at
what
in
that
safe
he
replied
once
we
get
to
know
this
mysterious
secret
of
sir
henry
i
and
my
friends
can
get
money
easily
enough
leave
it
all
to
me
but
how
this
matter
you
will
please
leave
entirely
to
me
winnie
he
repeated
with
determination
we
are
both
in
danger
great
danger
and
that
being
so
it
is
incumbent
upon
me
to
act
boldly
and
fearlessly
i
mean
to
get
the
key
and
see
what
is
within
that
safe
but
the
girl
asked
her
ladyship
within
one
week
from
the
girl
will
no
longer
trouble
us
he
said
with
an
evil
glance
i
do
not
intend
that
she
shall
remain
a
barrier
against
our
good
fortune
any
longer
understand
that
and
remain
perfectly
calm
whatever
may
happen
but
you
surely
do
intend
you
surely
will
not
i
shall
act
as
i
think
proper
and
without
any
sentimental
advice
from
you
he
declared
with
a
mock
bow
but
straightening
himself
instantly
when
at
the
door
was
heard
a
fumbling
and
the
man
in
blue
spectacles
his
thin
white
hand
groping
before
him
slowly
entered
the
room
chapter
xiv
concerns
the
curse
of
the
cardinal
gabrielle
and
walter
were
seated
together
under
one
of
the
big
oaks
at
the
edge
of
the
at
connachan
with
may
spencer
and
lady
murie
they
had
been
playing
but
his
mother
and
the
young
girl
had
gone
into
the
house
for
tea
leaving
the
lovers
alone
what
the
matter
with
you
darling
he
had
asked
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing
you
do
seem
yourself
somehow
she
started
quickly
and
pulling
herself
up
tried
to
smile
assuring
him
that
there
was
really
nothing
amiss
i
do
wish
you
tell
me
what
it
is
that
troubling
you
so
he
said
ever
since
i
returned
from
abroad
you
not
been
yourself
it
no
use
denying
it
you
know
i
have
felt
well
perhaps
i
think
it
must
be
the
weather
she
assured
him
but
he
viewing
the
facts
in
the
light
of
what
he
had
noticed
at
their
almost
daily
clandestine
meetings
knew
that
she
was
concealing
something
from
him
before
his
departure
on
that
journey
to
japan
she
had
always
been
so
very
frank
and
open
nowadays
however
she
seemed
to
have
entirely
changed
her
love
for
him
was
just
the
same
that
he
knew
it
was
her
unusual
manner
so
full
of
fear
and
vague
apprehension
which
caused
him
so
many
hours
of
grave
reflection
with
her
woman
cleverness
she
succeeded
in
changing
the
topic
of
conversation
and
presently
they
rose
to
join
his
mother
at
the
in
the
later
while
they
were
idling
in
the
hall
together
she
suddenly
exclaimed
walter
you
great
on
scottish
history
so
i
want
some
information
from
you
i
studying
the
legends
and
traditions
of
our
place
glencardine
what
do
you
happen
to
know
about
them
well
he
laughed
there
are
dozens
of
weird
tales
about
the
old
castle
i
remember
reading
quite
a
lot
of
extraordinary
stories
in
some
book
or
other
about
three
years
ago
i
found
it
in
the
library
here
oh
do
tell
me
all
about
it
she
urged
instantly
weird
legends
always
fascinate
me
of
course
i
know
just
the
outlines
of
its
history
it
the
tales
told
by
the
in
which
i
so
deeply
interested
you
mean
the
apparition
of
the
lady
in
green
and
all
that
yes
and
the
whispers
he
started
quickly
at
her
words
and
asked
what
do
you
know
about
them
dear
i
hope
you
have
heard
them
she
smiled
with
a
frantic
effort
at
unconcern
saying
and
what
harm
pray
would
they
have
done
me
even
if
i
had
well
he
said
they
are
only
heard
by
those
whose
days
are
numbered
at
least
so
say
the
folk
about
here
of
course
it
only
a
fable
she
laughed
the
people
of
the
ochils
are
so
very
superstitious
i
believe
the
fatal
result
of
listening
to
those
mysterious
whispers
has
been
proved
in
more
than
one
instance
remarked
the
young
man
quite
seriously
for
myself
i
do
not
believe
in
any
supernatural
agency
i
merely
tell
you
what
the
people
hereabouts
believe
nobody
from
this
neighbourhood
could
ever
be
induced
to
visit
your
ruins
on
a
moonlit
night
that
just
why
i
want
to
know
the
origin
of
the
unexplained
phenomenon
how
can
i
tell
you
but
you
know
i
mean
you
heard
the
legend
have
you
yes
was
his
reply
the
story
of
the
whispers
of
glencardine
is
well
known
all
through
perthshire
has
your
father
ever
told
you
he
refuses
because
no
doubt
he
fears
that
you
might
perhaps
take
it
into
your
head
to
go
there
one
night
and
try
to
listen
for
them
her
lover
said
do
not
court
misfortune
dearest
take
my
advice
and
give
the
place
a
very
wide
berth
there
is
without
a
doubt
some
uncanny
agency
there
the
girl
laughed
outright
i
do
declare
walter
that
you
believe
in
these
foolish
traditions
she
said
well
i
a
scot
you
see
darling
and
a
little
superstition
is
perhaps
permissible
especially
in
connection
with
such
a
mystery
as
the
strange
disappearance
of
cardinal
setoun
then
tell
me
the
real
story
as
you
know
it
she
urged
i
much
interested
i
only
heard
about
the
whispers
quite
recently
the
historical
facts
so
far
as
i
can
recollect
reading
them
in
the
book
in
question
he
said
are
to
the
effect
that
the
most
reverend
james
cardinal
setoun
archbishop
of
andrews
chancellor
of
the
kingdom
was
in
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
directing
all
his
energies
towards
consolidating
the
romish
power
in
scotland
and
not
hesitating
to
resort
to
any
crime
which
seemed
likely
to
accomplish
his
purpose
many
were
the
foul
assassinations
and
terrible
tortures
upon
innocent
persons
performed
at
his
orders
one
person
who
fell
into
the
hands
of
this
infamous
cleric
was
margaret
the
second
daughter
of
charles
lord
glencardine
a
beautiful
girl
of
nineteen
because
she
would
not
betray
her
lover
she
was
so
cruelly
tortured
in
the
cardinal
palace
that
she
expired
after
suffering
fearful
agony
and
her
body
was
sent
back
to
glencardine
with
an
insulting
message
to
her
father
who
at
once
swore
to
be
avenged
the
king
had
so
far
resigned
the
conduct
of
the
kingdom
into
the
hands
of
his
eminence
that
nothing
save
armed
force
could
oppose
him
setoun
knew
that
a
union
between
henry
viii
and
james
would
be
followed
by
the
downfall
of
the
papal
power
in
scotland
and
therefore
he
laid
a
skilful
plot
whilst
advising
james
to
resist
the
dictation
of
his
uncle
he
privately
accused
those
of
the
scottish
nobles
who
had
joined
the
reformers
of
meditated
treason
against
his
majesty
this
placed
the
king
in
a
serious
dilemma
for
he
could
not
proceed
against
henry
without
the
assistance
of
those
very
nobles
accused
as
traitors
the
wily
cardinal
had
hoped
that
james
would
in
seek
an
alliance
with
france
and
spain
but
he
was
mistaken
you
know
of
course
how
the
forces
of
the
kingdom
were
assembled
and
sent
against
the
duke
of
norfolk
the
invader
was
thus
repelled
and
the
cardinal
then
endeavoured
to
organise
a
new
expedition
under
romish
leaders
this
also
failing
his
eminence
endeavoured
to
dictate
to
the
country
through
the
earl
of
arran
the
governor
of
scotland
by
a
clever
ruse
he
pretended
friendship
with
erskine
of
dun
and
endeavoured
to
use
him
for
his
own
ends
curiously
enough
over
yonder
and
he
pointed
to
a
yellow
parchment
in
a
black
ebony
frame
hanging
upon
the
panelled
wall
of
the
hall
over
there
is
one
of
the
cardinal
letters
to
erskine
which
shows
the
infamous
cleric
smooth
insinuating
style
when
it
suited
his
purpose
i
go
and
get
it
for
you
to
read
the
young
man
rose
and
taking
it
down
brought
it
to
her
she
saw
that
the
parchment
about
eight
inches
long
by
four
wide
was
covered
with
writing
in
brown
ink
while
attached
was
a
formidable
oval
red
seal
which
bore
a
coat
of
arms
surmounting
the
cardinal
hat
with
difficulty
they
made
out
this
interesting
letter
to
read
as
follows
rycht
honourable

traist

cousing
the
lard
of
dvn
most
interesting
declared
the
young
girl
holding
the
frame
in
her
hands
it
doubly
interesting
because
it
is
believed
that
erskine
brother
henry
finding
himself
befooled
by
the
crafty
cardinal
united
with
lord
glencardine
to
kill
him
and
dispose
of
his
body
secretly
thus
ridding
scotland
of
one
of
her
worst
enemies
walter
went
on
for
the
past
five
years
stories
had
been
continually
leaking
out
of
setoun
inhuman
cruelty
his
unscrupulous
fiendish
tortures
inflicted
upon
all
those
who
displeased
him
and
how
certain
persons
who
stood
in
his
way
had
died
mysteriously
or
disappeared
no
one
knew
whither
hence
it
was
that
at
erskine
suggestion
wemyss
of
strathblane
went
over
to
glencardine
and
with
charles
lord
glencardine
conspired
to
invite
the
cardinal
there
on
pretence
of
taking
counsel
against
the
protestants
but
instead
to
take
his
life
the
conspirators
were
it
is
said
joined
by
the
earl
of
kintyre
and
by
mary
the
daughter
of
lord
charles
and
sister
of
the
poor
girl
so
brutally
done
to
death
by
his
eminence
on
several
successive
nights
the
best
means
of
getting
rid
of
setoun
were
considered
and
discussed
and
it
is
declared
that
the
whispers
now
heard
sometimes
at
glencardine
are
the
secret
deliberations
of
those
sworn
to
kill
the
infamous
cardinal
mary
the
daughter
of
the
house
was
allowed
to
decide
in
what
manner
her
sister
death
should
be
avenged
and
at
her
suggestion
it
was
resolved
that
the
inhuman
head
of
the
roman
church
should
before
his
life
was
taken
be
put
to
the
same
fiendish
tortures
as
those
to
which
her
sister
had
been
subjected
in
his
palace
it
is
curious
that
after
his
crime
the
cardinal
should
dare
to
visit
glencardine
gabrielle
remarked
not
exactly
his
lordship
pretending
that
he
wished
to
be
appointed
governor
of
scotland
in
the
place
of
the
earl
of
arran
had
purposely
made
his
peace
with
setoun
who
on
his
part
was
only
too
anxious
to
again
resume
friendly
relations
with
so
powerful
a
noble
therefore
early
in
may
he
went
on
a
private
visit
and
almost
unattended
to
glencardine
within
the
walls
of
which
fortress
he
disappeared
for
ever
what
exactly
occurred
will
never
be
known
all
that
the
commission
who
subsequently
sat
to
try
the
conspirators
were
able
to
discover
was
that
the
cardinal
had
been
taken
to
the
dungeon
beneath
the
north
tower
and
there
tortured
horribly
for
several
days
and
afterwards
burned
at
the
stake
in
the
courtyard
the
fire
being
ignited
by
lord
glencardine
himself
and
the
dead
cardinal
ashes
afterwards
scattered
to
the
winds
a
terrible
revenge
exclaimed
the
girl
with
a
shudder
they
were
veritable
fiends
in
those
days
they
were
he
laughed
rehanging
the
frame
upon
the
wall
some
historians
have
of
course
declared
that
setoun
was
murdered
at
mains
castle
and
others
declare
cortachy
to
have
been
the
scene
of
the
assassination
but
the
truth
that
it
occurred
at
glencardine
is
proved
by
a
quantity
of
the
family
papers
which
when
your
father
purchased
glencardine
came
into
his
possession
you
ought
to
search
through
them
i
will
i
had
no
idea
dad
possessed
any
of
the
glencardine
papers
she
declared
much
interested
in
that
story
of
the
past
perhaps
from
them
i
may
be
able
to
glean
something
further
regarding
the
strange
whispers
of
glencardine
make
whatever
searches
you
like
dearest
he
said
in
all
earnestness
but
never
attempt
to
investigate
the
whispers
themselves
and
as
they
were
alone
he
took
her
little
hand
in
his
and
looking
into
her
face
with
eyes
of
love
pressed
her
to
promise
him
never
to
disregard
his
warning
she
told
him
nothing
of
her
own
weird
experience
he
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
she
had
actually
heard
the
mysterious
whispers
and
that
as
a
consequence
a
great
evil
already
lay
upon
her
chapter
xv
follows
flockart
fortunes
one
evening
a
few
days
later
gabrielle
seated
beside
her
father
at
his
big
had
concluded
reading
some
reports
and
had
received
those
brief
laconic
replies
which
the
blind
man
was
in
the
habit
of
giving
when
she
suddenly
asked
i
believe
dad
that
you
have
a
quantity
of
the
glencardine
papers
have
you
if
i
remember
aright
when
you
bought
the
castle
you
made
possession
of
these
papers
a
stipulation
yes
dear
i
did
was
his
answer
i
thought
it
a
shame
that
the
papers
of
such
a
historic
family
should
be
dispersed
at
sotheby
as
they
no
doubt
would
have
been
so
i
purchased
them
you
never
let
me
see
them
she
said
as
you
know
you
taught
me
so
much
antiquarian
knowledge
that
i
becoming
an
enthusiast
like
yourself
you
can
see
them
dear
of
course
was
his
reply
they
are
in
that
big
ebony
cabinet
at
the
end
of
the
room
yonder
about
two
hundred
charters
letters
and
documents
dating
from
down
to
i
go
through
them
she
said
i
suppose
they
throw
a
good
deal
of
light
upon
the
history
of
the
grahams
and
the
actions
of
the
great
lord
glencardine
yes
but
i
fear
you
find
them
very
difficult
to
read
he
remarked
not
being
able
to
see
them
for
myself
alas
i
had
to
send
them
to
london
to
be
deciphered
and
you
still
have
the
translations
unfortunately
no
dear
professor
petre
at
oxford
who
is
preparing
his
great
work
on
glencardine
begged
me
to
let
him
see
them
and
he
still
has
them
well
she
laughed
i
must
therefore
content
myself
with
the
originals
eh
do
they
throw
any
further
light
upon
the
secret
agreement
in
between
the
great
marquess
of
glencardine
whose
home
was
here
and
king
charles
really
gabrielle
laughed
the
old
antiquary
for
a
girl
your
recollection
of
abstruse
historical
points
is
wonderful
not
at
all
there
was
a
mystery
i
remember
and
mysteries
always
attract
me
well
he
replied
after
a
few
moments
hesitation
i
fear
you
will
not
find
the
solution
of
that
point
or
of
any
other
really
important
point
contained
in
any
of
the
papers
the
most
interesting
records
they
contain
are
some
relating
to
alexander
senescallus
stewart
the
fourth
son
of
robert
who
was
granted
in
a
castle
of
garth
he
was
a
reprobate
and
known
as
the
wolf
of
badenoch
on
his
father
accession
in
he
was
granted
the
charters
of
badenoch
with
the
castle
of
lochindorb
and
of
strathavon
and
at
a
slightly
later
date
he
was
granted
the
lands
of
tempar
lassintulach
tulachcroske
and
gort
garth
as
you
know
many
traditions
regarding
him
still
survive
but
one
fact
contained
in
yonder
papers
is
always
interesting
for
it
shows
that
he
was
confined
in
the
dungeon
of
the
old
keep
of
glencardine
until
robert
iii
released
him
there
are
also
a
quantity
of
interesting
facts
regarding
neil
or
neil
stewart
of
fothergill
who
was
laird
of
garth
which
will
some
day
be
of
value
to
future
historians
of
scotland
is
there
anything
concerning
the
mysterious
fate
of
cardinal
setoun
within
glencardine
asked
the
girl
unable
to
curb
her
curiosity
no
he
replied
in
a
manner
which
was
almost
snappish
that
a
mere
tradition
my
dear
simply
a
tale
invented
by
the
it
seems
to
have
been
imagined
in
order
to
associate
it
with
the
mysterious
whispers
which
some
superstitious
people
claim
to
have
heard
no
old
castle
is
complete
nowadays
without
its
ghost
so
we
have
for
our
share
the
lady
of
glencardine
and
the
whispers
he
laughed
but
i
thought
it
was
a
matter
of
authenticated
history
that
the
cardinal
was
actually
enticed
here
and
disappeared
exclaimed
the
girl
i
should
have
thought
that
the
glencardine
papers
would
have
referred
to
it
she
added
recollecting
what
walter
had
told
her
well
they
do
so
why
worry
your
head
dear
over
a
mere
fable
i
have
already
gone
very
carefully
into
all
the
facts
that
are
proved
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
story
of
the
torture
of
his
eminence
is
a
and
that
the
supernatural
whispers
have
only
been
heard
in
imagination
she
was
silent
she
recollected
that
sound
of
murmuring
voices
it
was
certainly
not
imagination
but
you
let
me
have
the
key
of
the
cabinet
wo
you
dad
she
asked
glancing
across
to
where
stood
a
beautiful
old
florentine
cabinet
of
ebony
inlaid
with
ivory
and
reaching
almost
to
the
ceiling
certainly
gabrielle
dear
was
the
reply
of
the
expressionless
man
it
is
upstairs
in
my
room
you
shall
have
it
and
then
he
lapsed
again
into
silence
reflecting
whether
it
were
not
best
to
secure
certain
parchment
records
from
those
drawers
before
his
daughter
investigated
them
there
was
a
small
roll
of
yellow
parchment
tied
with
modern
tape
which
he
was
to
conceal
from
her
curious
gaze
truth
to
tell
they
constituted
a
record
of
the
torture
and
death
of
cardinal
setoun
much
in
the
same
manner
as
walter
murie
had
described
to
her
if
she
read
that
strange
chronicle
she
might
he
feared
be
impelled
to
watch
and
endeavour
to
hear
the
fatal
whispers
strange
though
it
was
yet
those
sounds
were
a
subject
which
caused
him
daily
apprehension
though
he
never
referred
to
them
save
to
ridicule
every
suggestion
of
their
existence
or
to
attribute
the
weird
noises
to
the
wind
yet
never
a
day
passed
but
he
sat
calmly
reflecting
that
one
matter
which
his
daughter
knew
above
all
others
caused
him
the
most
serious
thought
and
apprehension
a
fear
which
had
become
doubly
increased
since
she
had
referred
to
the
curious
and
apparently
inexplicable
phenomenon
he
a
refined
educated
man
of
brilliant
attainments
scouted
the
idea
of
any
supernatural
agency
to
those
who
had
made
mention
of
the
whispers
among
them
his
friend
murie
the
laird
of
connachan
lord
strathavon
from
whom
he
had
purchased
the
estate
and
several
of
the
neighbouring
landowners
he
had
always
expressed
a
hope
that
one
day
he
might
be
fortunate
enough
to
hear
the
whispered
counsel
of
the
evil
one
and
so
decide
for
himself
its
true
cause
he
pretended
always
to
treat
the
affair
with
humorous
incredulity
yet
at
heart
he
was
sorely
troubled
if
his
young
wife
remarkable
friendship
with
the
man
flockart
often
caused
him
bitter
thoughts
then
the
mysterious
whispers
and
the
fatality
so
strangely
connected
with
them
were
equally
a
source
of
constant
inquietude
a
few
days
later
flockart
with
clever
cunning
seemed
to
alter
his
ingenious
tactics
completely
for
suddenly
he
had
commenced
to
bestir
himself
in
sir
henry
interests
one
morning
after
breakfast
taking
the
baronet
by
the
arm
he
led
him
for
a
stroll
along
the
drive
down
to
the
and
back
for
the
purpose
as
he
explained
of
speaking
with
him
in
confidence
at
first
the
blind
man
was
full
of
curiosity
as
to
the
reason
of
this
unusual
action
as
those
deprived
of
sight
usually
are
i
know
sir
henry
flockart
said
presently
and
not
without
hesitation
that
certain
people
have
endeavoured
to
place
an
entirely
wrong
construction
upon
your
wife
friendship
towards
me
for
that
reason
i
have
decided
to
leave
glencardine
both
for
her
sake
and
for
yours
but
my
dear
fellow
exclaimed
the
blind
man
why
do
you
suggest
such
a
thing
because
your
wife
enemies
have
their
mouths
full
of
scandalous
lies
he
replied
i
tell
you
frankly
sir
henry
that
my
friendship
with
her
ladyship
is
a
purely
platonic
one
we
were
children
together
at
home
in
bedford
and
ever
since
our
schooldays
i
have
remained
her
friend
i
know
that
remarked
the
old
man
quietly
my
wife
told
me
that
when
you
dined
with
us
on
several
occasions
at
park
street
i
have
never
objected
to
the
friendship
existing
between
you
flockart
for
though
i
have
never
seen
you
i
have
always
believed
you
to
be
a
man
of
honour
i
feel
very
much
gratified
at
those
words
sir
henry
he
said
in
a
deep
earnest
voice
glancing
at
the
grey
face
of
the
fragile
man
whose
arm
he
was
holding
indeed
i
always
hoped
that
you
would
repose
sufficient
confidence
in
me
to
know
that
i
am
not
such
a
blackguard
as
to
take
any
advantage
of
your
cruel
affliction
the
blind
baronet
sighed
ah
my
dear
flockart
all
men
are
not
honourable
like
yourself
there
are
many
ready
to
take
advantage
of
my
lack
of
eyesight
i
have
experienced
it
alas
in
business
as
well
as
in
my
private
life
the
man
was
silent
he
was
playing
an
ingenious
if
dangerous
game
the
baronet
had
referred
to
business
his
mysterious
business
the
secret
of
which
he
was
now
trying
his
best
to
solve
yes
he
said
at
length
i
suppose
the
standard
of
honesty
in
business
is
nowadays
just
about
as
low
as
it
can
possibly
be
eh
well
never
been
in
business
myself
so
i
do
know
in
the
one
or
two
small
financial
deals
in
which
i
had
a
share
i
usually
been
out
in
the
end
ah
flockart
sighed
the
laird
of
glencardine
you
are
unfortunately
quite
correct
the
smart
business
man
is
the
one
who
robs
his
neighbour
without
committing
the
sin
of
being
found
out
this
remark
caused
the
other
a
twinge
of
conscience
did
he
intend
to
convey
any
hidden
meaning
he
was
full
of
cunning
and
cleverness
well
flockart
exclaimed
i
truly
gratified
to
think
that
i
retain
your
confidence
sir
henry
if
i
have
in
the
past
been
able
to
be
of
any
little
service
to
lady
heyburn
i
assure
you
i
am
only
too
delighted
yet
i
think
that
in
the
face
of
gossip
which
some
of
your
neighbours
here
are
trying
to
spread
gossip
started
i
very
much
fear
by
miss
gabrielle
my
absence
from
glencardine
will
be
of
distinct
advantage
to
all
concerned
i
do
not
my
dear
sir
henry
desire
for
one
single
moment
to
embarrass
you
or
to
place
her
ladyship
in
any
false
position
i
but
my
dear
fellow
you
become
quite
an
institution
with
us
exclaimed
sir
henry
in
dismay
we
should
all
be
lost
without
you
why
as
you
know
you
done
me
so
many
kindnesses
that
i
can
never
sufficiently
repay
you
i
do
forget
how
through
your
advice
been
able
to
effect
quite
a
number
of
economies
at
caistor
and
how
often
you
assist
my
wife
in
various
ways
in
her
social
duties
my
dear
sir
henry
he
laughed
you
know
i
always
ready
to
serve
either
of
you
whenever
it
lies
in
my
power
only
well
i
feel
that
in
your
wife
company
far
too
much
both
here
and
in
lincolnshire
people
are
talking
therefore
i
have
decided
to
leave
her
and
my
decision
is
irrevocable
let
them
talk
if
i
do
not
object
you
surely
need
not
but
for
your
wife
sake
i
know
i
know
how
cruel
are
people
tongues
flockart
remarked
the
old
man
yes
and
the
gossip
was
unfortunately
started
by
gabrielle
it
was
surely
very
unwise
of
her
ah
sighed
the
other
it
is
the
old
story
every
girl
becomes
jealous
of
her
and
she
only
a
child
after
all
he
added
apologetically
well
much
as
i
esteem
her
and
much
as
i
admire
her
i
feel
sir
henry
that
she
had
no
right
to
bring
discord
into
your
house
i
hope
you
will
permit
me
to
say
this
with
all
due
deference
to
the
fact
that
she
your
daughter
but
i
consider
her
conduct
in
this
matter
has
been
very
unfriendly
again
the
baronet
was
silent
and
his
companion
saw
that
he
was
reflecting
deeply
how
do
you
know
that
the
scandal
was
started
by
her
he
asked
presently
in
a
low
rather
strained
voice
young
paterson
told
me
so
it
appears
that
when
she
was
staying
with
them
over
at
tullyallan
she
told
his
mother
all
sorts
of
absurd
stories
and
paterson
who
as
you
know
is
a
terrible
gossip
told
the
reads
of
logie
and
the
redcastles
and
in
a
few
days
these
fictions
with
all
sorts
of
embroidery
were
spread
half
over
scotland
why
my
friend
lindsay
the
member
for
berwick
heard
some
whispers
the
other
day
in
the
carlton
club
so
in
consequence
of
that
sir
henry
i
resolved
much
against
my
will
and
inclination
i
assure
you
to
end
my
friendship
with
your
wife
all
this
pains
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
declared
the
old
man
the
more
so
too
that
gabrielle
should
have
allowed
her
jealousy
to
lead
her
to
make
such
false
charges
yes
in
order
not
to
pain
you
i
have
hesitated
to
tell
you
this
for
several
weeks
but
i
really
thought
that
you
ought
at
least
to
know
the
truth
and
who
originated
the
scandal
and
so
i
have
ventured
to
speak
openly
and
to
announce
my
departure
said
the
wily
flockart
he
was
putting
to
the
test
the
strength
of
his
position
in
that
household
he
had
an
ulterior
motive
one
that
was
ingenious
and
subtle
but
you
are
not
really
going
exclaimed
the
other
you
told
me
the
other
day
something
about
my
factor
macdonald
and
your
suspicions
of
certain
irregularities
my
dear
sir
henry
it
will
be
far
better
for
us
both
if
i
leave
to
remain
will
only
be
to
lend
further
colour
to
these
scandalous
rumours
i
have
decided
to
leave
your
house
you
believe
that
macdonald
is
dishonest
eh
inquired
the
afflicted
man
quickly
yes
i
certain
of
it
remember
sir
henry
that
when
one
is
dealing
with
a
man
who
is
blind
it
is
sometimes
a
great
temptation
to
be
dishonest
i
know
i
know
sighed
the
other
deeply
they
were
at
a
bend
in
the
drive
where
the
big
trees
met
overhead
forming
a
leafy
tunnel
the
ascent
was
a
trifle
steep
and
the
baronet
had
paused
for
a
few
seconds
leaning
heavily
upon
the
arm
of
his
friend
oh
pardon
me
exclaimed
flockart
suddenly
releasing
his
arm
your
is
hanging
down
let
me
put
it
right
for
you
and
for
a
few
seconds
he
fumbled
at
the
chain
at
the
same
time
holding
something
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
there
that
right
he
said
a
few
minutes
later
you
caught
it
somewhere
i
expect
on
one
of
the
knobs
of
my
perhaps
said
the
other
thanks
i
sometimes
inadvertently
pull
it
out
of
my
pocket
a
faint
smile
of
triumph
passed
across
the
dark
handsome
face
of
the
man
who
again
took
his
arm
as
at
the
same
time
he
replaced
something
in
his
own
he
had
in
that
instant
secured
what
he
wanted
you
were
saying
with
much
truth
my
dear
flockart
that
in
dealing
with
a
man
who
can
not
see
there
is
occasionally
a
temptation
towards
dishonesty
well
this
very
day
i
intend
to
have
a
long
chat
with
my
wife
but
before
i
do
so
will
you
promise
me
one
thing
and
what
is
that
asked
the
man
not
without
some
apprehension
that
you
will
remain
here
disregard
the
gossip
that
you
may
have
heard
and
continue
to
assist
me
in
my
helplessness
in
making
full
and
searching
inquiry
into
macdonald
alleged
defalcations
the
man
reflected
for
a
few
seconds
with
knit
brows
his
quick
wits
were
instantly
at
work
for
he
saw
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
that
he
had
been
entirely
successful
in
disarming
all
suspicion
therefore
his
next
move
must
be
the
defeat
of
that
man
devoted
defender
gabrielle
the
one
person
who
stood
between
his
own
penniless
self
and
fortune
i
really
can
not
at
this
moment
make
any
promise
sir
henry
he
remarked
at
last
i
have
decided
to
go
but
defer
your
decision
for
the
present
there
is
surely
no
immediate
hurry
for
your
departure
first
let
me
consult
my
wife
urged
the
baronet
putting
out
his
hand
and
groping
for
that
of
flockart
which
he
pressed
warmly
as
proof
of
his
continued
esteem
let
me
talk
to
winifred
she
shall
decide
whether
you
go
or
whether
you
shall
stay
chapter

shows
a
girl
bondage
walter
murie
had
chosen
politics
as
a
profession
long
ago
even
when
he
was
an
undergraduate
he
had
already
eaten
his
dinners
in
london
and
had
been
called
to
the
bar
as
the
first
step
towards
a
political
career
he
had
a
relative
in
the
foreign
office
while
his
uncle
had
held
an
in
the
late
government
therefore
he
had
influence
and
hoped
by
its
aid
to
secure
some
safe
seat
already
he
had
studied
both
home
and
foreign
affairs
very
closely
and
had
on
two
occasions
written
articles
in
the
upon
that
most
vexed
and
difficult
question
the
pacification
of
macedonia
he
was
a
very
fair
speaker
too
and
on
several
occasions
he
had
seconded
resolutions
and
made
quite
clever
speeches
at
political
gatherings
in
his
own
county
perthshire
indeed
politics
was
his
hobby
and
with
money
at
his
command
and
influence
in
high
quarters
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
within
the
next
few
years
gain
a
seat
in
the
house
with
sir
henry
heyburn
he
often
had
long
and
serious
chats
the
brilliant
politician
whose
career
had
so
suddenly
and
tragically
been
cut
short
gave
him
much
good
advice
pointing
out
the
special
questions
he
should
study
in
order
to
become
an
authority
this
is
the
age
of
specialising
and
in
politics
it
is
just
as
essential
to
be
a
specialist
as
it
is
in
the
medical
legal
or
any
other
profession
in
a
few
days
the
young
man
was
returning
to
his
dingy
chambers
in
the
temple
to
pore
again
over
those
mouldy
tomes
of
law
therefore
almost
daily
he
ran
over
to
glencardine
to
chat
with
the
blind
baronet
and
to
have
quiet
walks
with
the
sweet
girl
who
looked
so
dainty
in
her
fresh
white
frocks
and
whose
warm
kisses
were
so
soft
and
caressing
surely
no
pair
even
in
the
bygone
days
of
knight
and
dame
the
days
of
real
romance
were
more
devoted
to
each
other
with
satisfaction
he
saw
that
gabrielle
apparent
indifference
had
now
worn
off
it
had
been
but
the
mask
of
a
woman
whim
and
as
such
he
treated
it
one
afternoon
after
tea
out
on
the
lawn
they
were
walking
together
by
the
bypath
to
the
lodge
in
order
to
meet
lady
heyburn
who
had
gone
into
the
village
to
visit
a
bedridden
old
lady
they
were
strolling
for
on
the
morrow
he
was
going
south
and
would
probably
be
absent
for
some
months
the
girl
had
allowed
herself
to
remain
in
her
lover
arms
in
one
long
kiss
of
perfect
ecstasy
then
with
a
sigh
of
regret
she
had
held
his
hand
and
gone
forward
again
without
a
word
when
walter
had
left
the
sun
of
her
young
life
would
have
set
for
after
all
it
was
not
exactly
exciting
to
be
the
eyes
and
ears
of
a
man
who
was
blind
and
there
was
always
at
her
side
that
man
whom
she
hated
and
who
she
knew
was
her
bitterest
foe
james
flockart
of
late
her
father
seemed
to
have
taken
him
strangely
into
his
confidence
why
she
could
not
tell
a
sudden
change
of
front
on
the
baronet
part
was
unusual
but
as
she
watched
with
sinking
heart
she
could
not
conceal
from
herself
the
fact
that
flockart
now
exercised
considerable
influence
over
her
father
an
influence
which
in
some
matters
had
already
proved
to
be
greater
than
her
own
it
was
of
this
man
walter
spoke
i
have
a
regret
dearest
nay
more
than
a
regret
a
fear
in
leaving
you
here
alone
he
exclaimed
in
a
low
distinct
voice
gazing
into
the
blue
fathomless
depths
of
those
eyes
so
very
dear
to
him
a
fear
why
she
asked
in
some
surprise
returning
his
look
because
of
that
man
your
mother
friend
he
said
recently
i
have
heard
some
curious
tales
concerning
him
i
really
wonder
why
sir
henry
still
retains
him
as
his
guest
why
need
we
speak
of
him
she
exclaimed
quickly
for
the
subject
was
distasteful
because
i
wish
you
to
be
forewarned
he
said
in
a
serious
voice
that
man
is
no
fitting
companion
for
you
his
past
is
too
well
known
to
a
certain
circle
his
past
she
echoed
what
have
you
discovered
concerning
him
her
companion
did
not
answer
for
a
few
moments
how
could
he
tell
her
all
that
he
had
heard
his
desire
was
to
warn
her
yet
he
could
not
relate
to
her
the
allegations
made
by
certain
persons
against
flockart
gabrielle
he
said
all
that
i
have
heard
tends
to
show
that
his
friendship
for
you
and
for
your
father
is
false
therefore
avoid
him
beware
of
him
i
i
know
she
faltered
lowering
her
eyes
i
felt
that
was
the
case
all
along
yet
i
yet
what
he
asked
i
mean
i
want
you
to
promise
me
one
thing
walter
she
said
quickly
you
love
me
do
you
not
love
you
my
own
darling
how
can
you
ask
such
a
question
you
surely
know
that
i
do
then
if
you
really
love
me
you
will
make
me
a
promise
of
what
only
one
thing
one
little
thing
she
said
in
a
low
earnest
voice
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
if
if
that
man
ever
makes
an
allegation
against
me
you
wo
believe
him
an
allegation
why
darling
what
allegation
could
such
a
man
ever
make
against
you
he
is
my
enemy
she
remarked
simply
i
know
that
but
what
charge
could
he
bring
against
you
why
if
even
he
dared
to
utter
a
single
word
against
you
i
i
wring
the
neck
but
if
he
did
walter
you
would
believe
him
would
you
of
course
i
would
not
not
if
the
charge
he
made
against
me
was
a
terrible
one
a
a
disgraceful
one
she
asked
in
a
strained
voice
after
a
brief
and
painful
pause
why
dearest
he
cried
what
is
the
matter
you
are
really
not
yourself
you
seem
to
be
filled
with
a
graver
apprehension
even
than
i
am
what
does
it
mean
tell
me
it
means
walter
that
that
man
is
lady
heyburn
friend
hence
he
is
my
enemy
and
what
need
you
fear
when
you
have
me
as
your
friend
i
do
not
fear
if
you
will
still
remain
my
friend
always
in
face
of
any
allegation
he
makes
i
love
you
darling
surely
that
sufficient
guarantee
of
my
friendship
yes
she
responded
raising
her
white
troubled
face
to
his
while
he
bent
and
kissed
her
again
on
the
lips
i
know
that
i
am
yours
my
own
and
as
yours
i
will
not
fear
that
right
he
exclaimed
endeavouring
to
smile
cheer
up
i
like
to
see
you
on
this
last
day
and
apprehensive
like
this
i
am
not
so
without
cause
then
what
is
the
cause
he
demanded
surely
you
can
repose
confidence
in
me
again
she
was
silent
above
them
the
wind
stirred
the
leaves
and
through
the
high
bracken
a
rabbit
scuttled
at
their
feet
they
were
alone
and
she
stood
again
locked
in
her
lover
fond
embrace
you
have
told
me
yourself
that
man
flockart
is
my
enemy
she
said
in
a
low
voice
but
what
action
of
his
can
you
fear
surely
you
should
be
forearmed
against
any
evil
he
may
be
plotting
tell
me
the
truth
and
i
will
go
myself
to
your
father
and
denounce
the
fellow
before
his
face
ah
no
she
cried
full
of
quick
apprehension
never
think
of
doing
that
walter
why
am
i
not
your
friend
such
a
course
would
only
bring
his
wrath
down
upon
my
head
he
would
retaliate
quickly
and
i
alone
would
suffer
but
my
dear
gabrielle
he
exclaimed
you
really
speak
in
enigmas
whatever
can
you
fear
from
a
man
who
is
known
to
be
a
blackguard
whom
i
could
now
at
this
very
moment
expose
in
such
a
manner
that
he
would
never
dare
to
set
foot
in
perthshire
again
such
a
course
would
be
most
injudicious
i
assure
you
his
ruin
would
mean
it
would
mean
my
own
i
do
follow
you
ah
because
you
do
not
know
my
secret
you
your
secret
the
young
man
gasped
staring
at
her
yet
still
holding
her
trembling
form
in
his
strong
arms
why
what
do
you
mean
what
secret
i
i
can
not
tell
you
she
exclaimed
in
a
hard
mechanical
voice
looking
straight
before
her
but
you
must
he
protested
i
i
asked
you
walter
to
make
me
a
promise
she
said
her
voice
broken
by
emotion
a
promise
that
for
the
sake
of
the
love
you
bear
for
me
you
will
not
believe
that
man
that
you
will
disregard
any
allegation
against
me
and
i
promise
on
one
condition
darling
that
you
tell
me
in
confidence
what
i
as
your
future
husband
have
a
just
right
to
know
the
nature
of
this
secret
of
yours
ah
no
she
cried
unable
longer
to
restrain
her
tears
and
burying
her
pale
beautiful
face
upon
his
arm
i
i
was
foolish
to
have
spoken
of
it
she
sobbed
brokenly
i
ought
to
have
kept
it
to
myself
it
is
it
the
one
thing
that
i
can
never
reveal
to
you
to
you
of
all
men
chapter
xvii
describes
a
frenchman
visit
monsieur
goslin
sir
henry
hill
announced
entering
his
master
room
one
morning
a
fortnight
later
just
as
the
blind
man
was
about
to
descend
to
breakfast
he
in
the
library
sir
goslin
exclaimed
the
baronet
in
great
surprise
i
go
to
him
at
once
and
hill
serve
breakfast
for
two
in
the
library
and
tell
miss
gabrielle
that
i
do
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
this
morning
very
well
sir
henry
and
the
man
bowed
and
went
down
the
broad
oak
staircase
goslin
here
without
any
announcement
exclaimed
the
baronet
speaking
to
himself
something
must
have
happened
i
wonder
what
it
can
be
he
tugged
at
his
collar
to
render
it
more
comfortable
and
then
with
a
groping
hand
on
the
broad
balustrade
he
felt
his
way
down
the
stairs
and
along
the
corridor
to
the
big
library
where
a
stout
frenchman
came
forward
to
greet
him
warmly
after
carefully
closing
the
door
ah
cher
he
began
and
speaking
in
french
he
inquired
eagerly
after
the
baronet
health
he
was
rather
with
beard
worn
short
and
pointed
and
his
dark
eyes
and
his
countenance
showed
a
fund
of
good
humour
this
visit
is
quite
unexpected
exclaimed
sir
henry
you
were
not
due
till
the
no
but
circumstances
have
arisen
which
made
my
journey
imperative
so
i
left
the
gare
du
nord
at
four
yesterday
afternoon
was
at
charing
cross
at
eleven
had
to
catch
the
scotch
express
at
cross
and
here
i
am
oh
my
dear
goslin
you
always
move
so
quickly
you
simply
a
marvel
of
alertness
the
other
smiled
and
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
said
i
really
do
know
why
i
should
have
earned
a
reputation
as
a
rapid
traveller
except
perhaps
by
that
trip
i
made
last
year
from
paris
to
constantinople
when
i
remained
exactly
minutes
in
the
sultan
capital
but
i
did
my
business
there
nevertheless
even
though
i
got
through
quicker
than
les
of
the
most
estimable
agence
cook
you
want
a
wash
eh
ah
no
my
friend
i
washed
at
the
hotel
in
perth
where
i
took
my
morning
coffee
when
i
come
to
scotland
i
carry
no
baggage
save
my
in
my
pocket
and
a
clean
collar
across
my
chest
its
ends
held
by
my
braces
the
baronet
laughed
heartily
his
friend
was
always
most
resourceful
and
ingenious
he
was
a
mystery
to
all
at
glencardine
and
to
lady
heyburn
most
of
all
his
visits
were
always
unexpected
while
as
to
who
he
really
was
or
whence
he
came
nobody
not
even
gabrielle
herself
knew
at
times
the
frenchman
would
take
his
meals
alone
with
sir
henry
in
the
library
while
at
others
he
would
lunch
with
her
ladyship
and
her
guests
on
these
latter
occasions
he
proved
himself
a
most
amusing
cosmopolitan
and
at
the
same
time
exhibited
an
extreme
courtliness
towards
every
one
his
manner
was
quite
charming
yet
his
presence
there
was
always
puzzling
and
had
given
rise
to
considerable
speculation
hill
came
in
and
after
helping
the
frenchman
to
take
off
his
heavy
laid
a
small
table
for
two
and
prepared
breakfast
then
when
he
had
served
it
and
left
goslin
rose
and
crossing
to
the
door
pushed
the
little
brass
bolt
into
its
socket
returning
to
his
chair
opposite
the
blind
man
whose
food
hill
had
already
cut
up
for
him
he
exclaimed
in
a
very
calm
serious
voice
speaking
in
french
i
want
you
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
sir
henry
without
exciting
yourself
unduly
something
has
occurred
something
very
strange
and
remarkable
the
other
dropped
his
knife
and
sat
statuesque
and
expressionless
go
on
he
said
hoarsely
tell
me
the
worst
at
once
the
worst
has
not
yet
happened
it
is
that
which
i
dreading
well
what
has
happened
is
is
the
secret
out
the
secret
is
safe
for
the
present
the
blind
man
drew
a
long
breath
well
that
one
thing
to
be
thankful
for
he
gasped
i
was
afraid
you
were
going
to
tell
me
that
the
facts
were
exposed
they
may
yet
be
exposed
the
mysterious
visitor
exclaimed
where
lies
the
danger
we
have
been
betrayed
eh
you
may
as
well
admit
the
ugly
truth
at
once
goslin
i
do
not
conceal
it
sir
henry
we
have
by
whom
by
somebody
here
in
this
house
here
what
do
you
mean
somebody
in
my
own
house
yes
the
greek
affair
is
known
they
have
been
put
upon
their
guard
in
athens
by
whom
cried
the
baronet
starting
from
his
chair
by
somebody
whom
we
can
not
trace
somebody
who
must
have
had
access
to
your
papers
no
one
has
had
access
to
my
papers
i
always
take
good
care
of
that
goslin
very
good
care
of
that
the
affair
has
leaked
out
at
your
end
not
at
mine
at
our
end
we
are
always
circumspect
the
frenchman
said
calmly
rest
assured
that
nobody
but
we
ourselves
are
aware
of
our
operations
or
intentions
we
know
only
too
well
that
any
revelation
would
assuredly
bring
upon
us
disaster
but
a
revelation
has
actually
been
made
exclaimed
sir
henry
bending
forward
therefore
the
worst
is
to
be
feared
exactly
that
is
what
i
am
endeavouring
to
convey
the
betrayal
must
have
come
from
your
end
i
expect
not
from
here
i
regret
to
assert
that
it
came
from
here
from
this
very
room
how
do
you
know
that
because
in
athens
they
have
a
complete
copy
of
one
of
the
documents
which
you
showed
me
on
the
last
occasion
i
was
here
and
which
we
have
never
had
in
our
possession
the
blind
man
was
silent
the
allegation
admitted
of
no
argument
my
daughter
gabrielle
is
the
only
person
who
has
seen
it
and
she
understands
nothing
of
our
affairs
as
you
know
quite
well
she
may
have
copied
it
my
daughter
would
never
betray
me
goslin
said
sir
henry
in
a
hard
distinct
voice
rising
from
the
table
and
slowly
walking
down
the
long
room
has
no
one
else
been
able
to
open
your
safe
and
examine
its
contents
asked
the
frenchman
glancing
over
to
the
small
steel
door
let
into
the
wall
close
to
where
he
was
sitting
no
one
though
i
blind
do
you
consider
me
a
fool
surely
i
recognise
only
too
well
how
essential
is
secrecy
have
i
not
always
taken
the
most
extraordinary
precautions
you
have
sir
henry
i
quite
admit
that
indeed
the
precautions
taken
would
if
known
to
the
world
be
regarded
well
as
simply
amazing
i
hope
the
world
will
never
know
the
truth
it
will
know
the
truth
they
have
the
copies
in
athens
if
there
is
a
traitor
as
we
have
now
proved
the
existence
of
one
then
we
can
never
in
future
rest
secure
at
any
moment
another
exposure
may
result
with
its
attendant
disaster
the
baronet
halted
before
one
of
the
long
windows
the
morning
sunshine
falling
full
upon
his
sad
grey
face
he
drew
a
long
sigh
and
said
goslin
do
not
let
us
discuss
the
future
tell
me
exactly
what
is
the
present
situation
the
present
situation
the
frenchman
said
in
a
dry
voice
is
one
full
of
peril
for
us
you
have
over
there
in
your
safe
a
certain
paper
a
confidential
report
which
you
received
direct
from
vienna
it
was
brought
to
you
by
special
messenger
because
its
nature
was
not
such
as
should
be
sent
through
the
post
a
trusted
official
of
the
austrian
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
brought
it
here
to
whom
did
he
deliver
it
to
gabrielle
she
signed
a
receipt
and
she
broke
the
seals
no
i
was
present
and
she
handed
it
to
me
i
broke
the
seals
myself
she
read
it
over
to
me
ah
ejaculated
the
frenchman
suspiciously
it
is
unfortunate
that
you
are
compelled
to
entrust
our
secrets
to
a
woman
my
daughter
is
my
best
friend
indeed
perhaps
my
only
friend
then
you
have
enemies
who
has
not
true
we
all
of
us
have
enemies
replied
the
mysterious
visitor
but
in
this
case
how
do
you
account
for
that
report
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
people
in
athens
who
keeps
the
key
of
the
safe
i
do
it
is
never
out
of
my
possession
at
night
what
do
you
do
with
it
i
hide
it
in
a
secret
place
in
my
room
and
i
sleep
with
the
door
locked
then
as
far
as
you
are
aware
nobody
has
ever
had
possession
of
your
key
not
even
mademoiselle
your
daughter
not
even
gabrielle
i
always
lock
and
unlock
the
safe
myself
but
she
has
access
to
its
contents
when
it
is
open
the
visitor
remarked
acting
as
your
secretary
she
is
of
course
aware
of
a
good
deal
of
your
business
no
you
are
mistaken
have
we
not
arranged
a
code
in
order
to
prevent
her
from
satisfying
her
woman
natural
inquisitiveness
that
admitted
but
the
document
in
question
though
somewhat
guarded
is
sufficiently
plain
to
any
one
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
our
negotiations
the
blind
man
crossed
to
the
safe
and
with
the
key
upon
his
chain
opened
it
and
after
fumbling
in
one
of
the
long
iron
drawers
revealed
within
took
out
a
big
oblong
envelope
and
secured
with
five
black
seals
now
however
broken
this
he
handed
to
his
friend
saying
read
it
again
to
refresh
your
memory
i
know
myself
what
it
says
pretty
well
by
heart
monsieur
goslin
drew
forth
the
paper
within
and
read
the
lines
of
close
even
writing
it
was
in
german
he
stood
near
the
window
as
he
read
while
sir
henry
remained
near
the
open
safe
hill
tapped
at
the
bolted
door
but
his
master
replied
that
he
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
yes
the
frenchman
said
at
last
the
copy
they
have
in
athens
is
exact
word
for
word
they
may
have
obtained
it
from
vienna
no
it
came
from
here
there
are
some
pencilled
comments
in
your
daughter
handwriting
they
were
dictated
by
me
exactly
and
they
appear
in
the
copy
now
in
the
hands
of
the
people
in
athens
thus
it
is
doubly
proved
that
it
was
this
actual
document
which
was
copied
but
by
whom
ah
sighed
the
helpless
man
his
face
drawn
and
paler
than
usual
gabrielle
is
the
only
person
who
has
had
sight
of
it
mademoiselle
surely
could
not
have
copied
it
remarked
the
frenchman
has
she
a
lover
yes
the
son
of
a
neighbour
of
mine
a
very
worthy
young
fellow
goslin
grunted
dubiously
it
was
apparent
that
he
suspected
her
of
trickery
information
such
as
had
been
supplied
to
the
greek
government
would
he
knew
be
paid
for
and
at
a
high
price
had
lover
had
a
hand
in
that
revelation
i
would
not
suggest
for
a
single
moment
sir
henry
that
mademoiselle
your
daughter
would
act
in
any
way
against
your
personal
interests
but
but
what
demanded
the
blind
man
fiercely
turning
towards
his
visitor
well
it
is
peculiar
very
peculiar
to
say
the
least
sir
henry
was
silent
within
himself
he
was
compelled
to
admit
that
certain
suspicion
attached
to
gabrielle
and
yet
was
she
not
his
most
devoted
nay
his
only
friend
some
one
has
copied
the
report
evident
he
said
in
a
low
hard
voice
reflecting
deeply
and
by
so
doing
has
placed
us
in
a
position
of
grave
peril
sir
henry
imminent
peril
remarked
the
visitor
i
see
in
this
an
attempt
to
obtain
further
knowledge
of
our
affairs
we
have
a
secret
enemy
who
it
seems
has
found
a
vulnerable
point
in
our
armour
surely
my
own
daughter
can
not
be
my
enemy
cried
the
blind
man
in
dismay
you
say
she
has
a
lover
remarked
the
frenchman
speaking
slowly
and
with
deliberation
may
not
he
be
the
instigator
walter
murie
is
upright
and
honourable
replied
the
blind
man
and
yet
a
sigh
prevented
the
conclusion
of
that
sentence
ah
i
know
exclaimed
the
mysterious
visitor
in
a
tone
of
sympathy
you
are
uncertain
in
your
conclusions
because
of
your
terrible
affliction
sometimes
alas
my
dear
friend
you
are
imposed
upon
because
you
are
blind
yes
responded
the
other
bitterly
that
is
the
truth
goslin
because
i
can
not
see
like
other
men
i
have
been
deceived
foully
and
grossly
deceived
and
betrayed
but
but
he
cried
they
thought
to
ruin
me
and
i
tricked
them
goslin
yes
tricked
them
have
no
fear
for
the
present
our
secrets
are
our
own
chapter
xviii
reveals
the
spy
the
twelfth
the
glorious
twelfth
had
come
and
gone
the
rush
to
the
north
had
commenced
from
london
from
euston
pancras
and
cross
the
night
trains
for
scotland
had
run
in
triplicate
crowded
by
men
and
and
while
gloomy
old
perth
station
was
a
scene
of
unwonted
activity
each
morning
at
glencardine
there
were
little
or
no
grouse
therefore
it
was
not
until
later
that
sir
henry
invited
his
usual
party
gabrielle
had
been
south
to
visit
one
of
her
girlfriends
near
durham
and
the
week
of
her
absence
her
afflicted
father
had
spent
in
dark
loneliness
for
flockart
had
gone
to
london
and
her
ladyship
was
away
on
a
fortnight
visit
to
the
pelhams
down
at
new
galloway
on
the
last
day
of
august
however
gabrielle
returned
being
followed
a
few
hours
later
by
lady
heyburn
who
had
travelled
up
by
way
of
stirling
and
crieff
junction
while
that
same
night
eight
men
forming
the
arrived
by
the
day
express
from
the
south
the
gathering
was
a
merry
one
the
guests
were
the
same
who
came
up
there
every
year
some
of
them
friends
of
sir
henry
in
the
days
of
his
brilliant
career
others
friends
of
his
wife
the
shooting
at
glencardine
was
always
excellent
and
stewart
wise
and
serious
had
prophesied
sport
walter
murie
was
in
london
while
gabrielle
had
been
at
durham
he
had
travelled
up
there
spent
the
night
at
the
three
tuns
and
met
her
next
morning
in
that
pretty
wooded
walk
they
call
the
banks
devoted
to
her
as
he
was
he
could
not
bear
any
long
separation
while
she
on
her
part
was
gratified
by
this
attention
not
without
some
difficulty
did
she
succeed
in
getting
away
from
her
friends
to
meet
him
for
a
provincial
town
is
not
like
london
and
any
stranger
is
always
in
the
public
eye
but
they
spent
a
delightful
couple
of
hours
together
strolling
along
the
footpath
through
the
meadows
in
the
direction
of
finchale
priory
there
were
no
eavesdroppers
and
he
with
his
arm
linked
in
hers
repeated
the
story
of
his
love
she
listened
in
silence
then
raising
her
fine
clear
eyes
to
his
said
i
know
walter
i
know
that
you
love
me
and
i
love
you
also
ah
he
sighed
if
you
would
only
be
frank
with
me
dearest
if
you
would
only
be
as
frank
with
me
as
i
am
with
you
sadly
she
shook
her
head
but
made
no
reply
he
saw
that
a
shadow
had
clouded
her
brow
that
she
still
clung
to
her
strange
secret
and
at
length
when
they
retraced
their
steps
back
to
the
city
he
reluctantly
took
leave
of
her
and
later
was
speeding
south
again
towards
york
and
king
cross
the
opening
day
of
the
partridge
season
proved
bright
and
pleasant
the
men
were
out
early
and
the
ladies
a
gay
party
including
gabrielle
joined
them
at
luncheon
spread
on
a
mossy
bank
about
three
miles
from
the
castle
several
of
the
male
guests
were
particularly
attentive
to
the
dainty
girl
whose
charming
manner
and
fresh
beauty
attracted
them
but
gabrielle
heart
was
with
walter
always
she
loved
him
yes
she
told
herself
so
a
dozen
times
each
day
and
yet
was
not
the
barrier
between
them
insurmountable
ah
if
he
only
knew
if
he
only
knew
the
blind
man
was
left
alone
nearly
the
whole
of
that
day
his
daughter
had
wanted
to
remain
with
him
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it
my
dear
child
he
had
said
you
must
go
out
and
lunch
you
really
must
assist
your
mother
in
entertaining
the
people
but
dear
dad
i
much
prefer
to
remain
with
you
and
help
you
she
protested
yesterday
the
professor
sent
you
five
more
bronze
matrices
of
ecclesiastical
seals
we
have
yet
examined
them
we
do
so
dear
he
said
you
go
out
i
amuse
myself
all
right
perhaps
i
go
for
a
little
walk
therefore
the
girl
had
against
her
inclination
joined
the
where
foremost
of
all
to
have
her
little
attentions
was
a
rather
foppish
young
stockbroker
named
girdlestone
who
had
been
up
there
shooting
the
previous
year
and
had
on
that
occasion
flirted
with
her
furiously
during
her
absence
her
father
tried
to
resume
his
knitting
an
occupation
which
he
had
long
ago
been
compelled
to
resort
to
in
order
to
employ
his
time
but
he
soon
put
it
down
with
a
sigh
rose
and
taking
his
soft
brown
and
stout
stick
tapped
his
way
along
through
the
great
hall
and
out
into
the
park
he
felt
the
warmth
upon
his
cheek
as
he
passed
slowly
along
down
the
broad
drive
ah
he
murmured
to
himself
if
only
i
could
once
again
see
god
sunlight
if
i
could
only
see
the
greenery
of
nature
and
the
face
of
my
darling
child
and
he
sighed
brokenly
and
went
on
his
chin
sunk
upon
his
breast
a
despairing
hopeless
man
surely
no
figure
more
pathetic
than
his
could
be
found
in
the
whole
of
scotland
upon
him
had
been
showered
honour
great
wealth
all
indeed
that
makes
life
worth
living
and
yet
deprived
of
sight
he
existed
in
that
world
of
darkness
deceived
and
plotted
against
by
all
about
him
his
grey
countenance
was
hard
and
thoughtful
as
he
passed
slowly
along
tapping
the
ground
before
him
for
he
was
thinking
ever
thinking
of
the
declaration
of
his
french
visitor
he
had
been
betrayed
but
by
whom
his
thoughts
were
wandering
back
to
those
days
when
he
could
see
those
days
when
he
had
held
the
house
in
silence
by
his
brilliant
oratory
and
when
the
papers
next
day
had
leading
articles
concerning
his
speeches
he
recollected
his
old
club
in
james
street
boodle
of
which
he
had
been
so
fond
then
came
his
affliction
the
thought
of
it
all
struck
him
suddenly
and
clenching
his
hands
he
murmured
some
inarticulate
words
through
his
teeth
they
sounded
strangely
like
a
threat
next
instant
however
he
laughed
bitterly
to
himself
the
dry
harsh
laugh
of
a
man
into
whose
very
soul
the
iron
had
entered
in
the
distance
he
could
hear
the
shots
of
his
guests
those
men
who
accepted
his
hospitality
and
who
among
themselves
agreed
that
he
was
a
terrible
bore
poor
old
fellow
they
came
up
there
with
perhaps
two
exceptions
to
eat
his
dinners
drink
his
choice
wines
and
shoot
his
birds
but
begrudged
him
more
than
ten
minutes
or
so
of
their
company
each
day
in
the
of
an
evening
as
he
sat
upon
one
of
the
long
lounges
they
would
perhaps
deign
to
chat
with
him
but
alas
he
knew
that
he
was
only
as
a
wet
blanket
to
his
wife
guests
hence
he
kept
himself
so
much
to
the
library
his
own
domain
that
night
he
spent
in
the
in
order
to
hear
what
sport
they
had
had
but
very
soon
escaped
and
with
gabrielle
returned
again
to
the
library
to
fulfil
his
promise
and
examine
the
which
the
professor
had
sent
to
where
they
sat
came
bursts
of
boisterous
laughter
and
of
the
of
the
pianola
in
the
hall
for
in
the
shooting
season
the
echoes
of
the
fine
mansion
were
awakened
by
the
merriment
of
as
gay
a
crowd
as
any
who
assembled
in
the
highlands
sir
henry
heard
it
the
sounds
jarred
upon
his
nerves
mirth
such
as
theirs
was
debarred
him
for
ever
and
he
had
now
become
gloomy
and
misanthropic
he
sat
fingering
those
big
oval
matrices
of
bronze
listening
to
gabrielle
voice
deciphering
the
inscriptions
and
explaining
what
was
meant
and
what
was
possibly
their
history
one
which
sir
henry
declared
to
be
the
gem
of
them
all
bore
the
for
device
and
was
the
seal
of
archbishop
richard
several
documents
bearing
impressions
of
this
seal
were
he
said
preserved
at
canterbury
and
in
the
british
museum
but
here
the
actual
seal
itself
had
come
to
light
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
an
expert
he
lingered
over
the
matrice
feeling
it
carefully
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
tracing
the
device
with
the
nail
of
his
forefinger
splendid
he
declared
the
lettering
is
a
most
excellent
specimen
of
early
lombardic
and
then
he
gave
the
girl
the
titles
of
several
works
which
she
got
down
from
the
shelves
and
from
which
she
read
extracts
after
some
careful
search
the
sent
with
the
matrices
she
placed
carefully
with
her
father
collection
and
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
they
were
occupied
in
replying
to
several
letters
regarding
estate
matters
at
eleven
she
kissed
her
father
and
passed
out
to
the
hall
where
the
pianola
was
still
going
and
where
the
merriment
was
still
in
full
swing
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
was
compelled
to
remain
with
the
insipid
young
ass
bertie
girdlestone
a
man
who
patronised
musical
comedy
nightly
and
afterwards
supped
regularly
at
the
savoy
then
she
escaped
at
last
to
her
room
exchanging
her
pretty
gown
of
turquoise
chiffon
for
an
easy
wrap
she
took
up
a
novel
and
switching
on
her
sat
down
to
enjoy
a
quiet
hour
before
retiring
quickly
she
became
engrossed
in
the
story
and
though
the
sounded
each
she
remained
undisturbed
by
them
it
was
two
before
she
had
reached
the
happy
of
the
book
and
closing
it
she
rose
to
take
off
her
trinkets
having
divested
herself
of
bracelets
rings
and
necklet
she
placed
her
hands
to
her
ears
there
was
only
one
the
other
was
missing
they
were
sapphires
a
present
from
walter
on
her
last
birthday
he
had
sent
them
to
her
from
yokohama
and
she
greatly
prized
them
therefore
at
risk
of
being
seen
in
her
by
any
of
the
male
guests
who
might
still
be
astir
for
she
knew
they
always
played
billiards
until
very
late
she
took
off
her
little
blue
satin
slippers
and
stole
out
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
broad
staircase
the
place
was
in
darkness
but
she
turned
on
the
light
and
again
when
she
reached
the
hall
she
must
have
dropped
her
in
the
library
of
that
she
felt
sure
servants
were
so
careless
that
if
she
left
it
it
might
easily
be
swept
up
in
the
morning
and
lost
for
ever
that
thought
had
caused
her
to
search
for
it
at
once
as
she
approached
the
library
door
she
thought
she
heard
the
sound
as
of
some
one
within
on
her
opening
the
door
however
all
was
in
darkness
she
laughed
at
her
apprehension
in
an
instant
she
touched
the
switch
and
the
place
became
flooded
by
a
soft
mellow
light
from
lamps
cunningly
concealed
behind
the
bookcases
against
the
wall
at
the
same
moment
however
she
detected
a
movement
behind
one
of
the
bookcases
against
which
she
stood
with
sudden
resolution
and
fearlessness
she
stepped
forward
to
ascertain
its
cause
her
eyes
at
that
instant
fell
upon
a
sight
which
caused
her
to
start
and
stand
dumb
with
amazement
straight
before
her
the
door
of
her
safe
stood
open
beside
it
startled
at
the
sudden
interruption
stood
a
man
in
with
a
small
electric
lamp
in
his
clenched
hand
a
pair
of
dark
evil
eyes
met
hers
in
defiance
the
eyes
of
james
flockart
you
she
gasped
yes
he
laughed
dryly
do
be
afraid
it
only
i
but
by
jove
how
very
charming
you
look
in
that
gown
i
love
to
get
a
snapshot
of
you
just
as
you
stand
now
what
are
you
doing
there
examining
my
father
papers
she
demanded
quickly
her
small
hands
clenched
my
dear
girl
he
replied
with
affected
unconcern
that
my
own
business
you
really
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
long
ago
it
discreet
you
know
to
be
down
here
with
me
at
this
hour
i
demand
to
know
what
you
are
doing
here
she
cried
firmly
and
my
dear
little
girl
i
refuse
to
tell
you
was
his
decisive
answer
very
well
then
i
shall
alarm
the
house
and
explain
to
my
father
what
i
have
discovered
chapter
xix
shows
gabrielle
defiant
gabrielle
crossed
quickly
to
one
of
the
long
windows
which
she
unbolted
and
flung
open
expecting
to
hear
the
shrill
whir
of
the
which
every
night
hill
switched
on
before
retiring
my
dear
little
girl
exclaimed
the
man
smiling
as
he
strolled
leisurely
across
to
her
with
a
cool
perfect
unconcern
which
showed
how
completely
he
was
master
why
create
such
a
beastly
draught
nothing
will
happen
for
i
already
seen
to
those
wires
you
a
thief
she
cried
drawing
herself
up
angrily
i
shall
go
straight
to
my
father
and
tell
him
at
once
you
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
act
exactly
as
you
choose
was
flockart
answer
as
he
bowed
before
her
with
irritating
mock
politeness
but
before
you
go
pray
allow
me
to
finish
these
most
interesting
documents
some
of
which
i
believe
are
in
your
very
neat
handwriting
my
father
business
is
his
own
alone
and
you
have
no
right
whatever
to
pry
into
it
i
thought
you
were
posing
as
his
friend
she
cried
in
bitter
protest
as
she
stood
with
both
her
hands
clenched
i
am
his
friend
he
declared
some
day
gabrielle
you
will
know
the
truth
of
how
near
he
is
to
disaster
and
how
i
am
risking
much
in
an
endeavour
to
save
him
i
do
believe
you
she
exclaimed
in
undisguised
disgust
in
your
heart
there
is
not
one
single
spark
of
sympathy
with
him
in
his
affliction
or
with
me
in
my
ghastly
position
your
position
is
only
your
own
seeking
my
dear
child
was
his
cold
response
i
gave
you
full
warning
long
ago
you
ca
deny
that
you
conspired
with
lady
heyburn
against
me
she
cried
i
have
discovered
more
about
it
than
you
think
and
i
now
openly
defy
you
flockart
please
understand
that
good
he
replied
still
unruffled
i
quite
understand
you
will
pardon
my
resuming
wo
you
and
walking
back
to
the
open
safe
he
drew
forth
a
small
bundle
of
papers
from
a
drawer
then
he
threw
himself
into
a
leather
and
proceeded
to
untie
the
tape
and
examine
the
documents
one
by
one
as
though
in
eager
search
of
something
though
lady
heyburn
may
be
your
friend
i
am
quite
sure
even
she
would
never
for
a
moment
countenance
such
a
dastardly
action
as
this
cried
the
girl
crimsoning
in
anger
you
come
here
accept
my
hospitality
and
make
pretence
of
being
his
friend
and
adviser
yet
you
are
conspiring
against
him
as
you
have
done
against
myself
so
far
as
you
yourself
are
concerned
my
dear
gabrielle
he
laughed
without
deigning
to
look
up
from
the
papers
he
was
scanning
i
offered
you
my
friendship
but
you
refused
it
friendship
she
cried
in
sarcasm
your
friendship
flockart
what
pray
is
it
worth
you
surely
know
what
people
are
saying
the
construction
they
are
placing
upon
your
friendship
for
lady
heyburn
the
misconstruction
you
mean
he
exclaimed
airily
correcting
her
well
to
me
it
matters
not
a
single
jot
the
world
is
always
and
a
woman
can
surely
have
a
male
friend
without
being
subject
to
hostile
and
venomous
criticism
when
the
male
friend
is
an
honest
man
said
the
girl
meaningly
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
continued
reading
as
though
utterly
disregarding
her
presence
what
should
she
do
how
should
she
act
she
knew
quite
well
that
from
those
papers
he
could
gather
no
knowledge
of
her
father
affairs
unless
he
held
some
secret
knowledge
of
the
true
meaning
of
those
cryptic
terms
and
allusions
to
her
they
were
all
as
hebrew
only
that
very
day
monsieur
goslin
had
again
made
one
of
those
unexpected
visits
remaining
from
eleven
in
the
morning
until
three
afterwards
taking
his
leave
and
driving
back
in
the
car
to
auchterarder
station
she
had
not
seen
him
but
he
had
brought
from
paris
for
her
a
big
box
of
chocolates
tied
with
violet
ribbons
as
had
been
his
habit
for
quite
a
couple
of
years
past
she
was
a
particular
favourite
with
the
polite
frenchman
her
father
demeanour
was
always
more
thoughtful
and
serious
after
the
stranger
visits
business
matters
put
before
him
by
his
visitor
always
it
seemed
required
much
deep
thought
and
ample
consideration
some
papers
brought
to
her
father
by
goslin
she
had
placed
in
the
safe
earlier
that
evening
and
these
she
recognised
were
now
in
hands
she
had
not
read
them
herself
and
had
no
idea
of
their
contents
they
were
to
her
never
interesting
flockart
she
exclaimed
very
firmly
at
last
i
ask
you
to
kindly
replace
those
papers
in
my
father
safe
relock
it
and
hand
me
the
key
that
i
certainly
refuse
to
do
was
the
man
defiant
reply
bowing
as
he
spoke
you
would
prefer
then
that
i
should
go
up
to
my
father
and
explain
all
i
have
seen
i
repeat
what
i
have
already
said
you
are
perfectly
at
liberty
to
tell
whom
you
like
it
makes
no
difference
whatever
to
me
and
well
i
want
to
be
disturbed
just
now
rising
he
walked
across
to
the
and
taking
a
piece
of
bearing
the
heyburn
crest
rapidly
pencilled
some
memoranda
upon
it
he
was
it
seemed
taking
a
copy
of
one
of
the
documents
suddenly
she
sprang
towards
him
crying
give
me
that
paper
give
it
to
me
at
once
i
say
it
is
my
father
he
straightened
himself
from
the
table
pulled
down
his
white
with
its
amethyst
buttons
and
looking
straight
into
her
face
ordered
her
to
leave
the
room
i
shall
not
go
she
answered
boldly
i
have
discovered
a
thief
in
my
father
house
therefore
my
duty
is
to
remain
here
no
surely
your
duty
is
to
go
upstairs
and
tell
him
and
he
bent
again
resuming
his
rapid
memoranda
well
he
asked
defiantly
a
few
moments
later
seeing
that
she
had
not
moved
are
you
going
i
shall
not
leave
you
here
alone
do
i
might
run
away
with
some
of
the
ornaments
oh
yes
exclaimed
the
girl
bitterly
you
taunt
me
because
you
are
well
aware
of
my
helplessness
of
what
occurred
on
that
afternoon
of
how
completely
you
have
me
in
your
power
i
see
it
all
you
defy
me
well
knowing
that
you
could
in
a
moment
bring
upon
me
a
vengeance
terrible
and
complete
it
is
all
horrible
she
cried
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
i
know
that
i
am
in
your
power
and
you
have
no
pity
no
remorse
i
gave
you
full
warning
he
declared
placing
the
papers
upon
the
table
and
looking
at
her
i
gave
you
your
choice
you
can
not
blame
me
you
had
ample
time
and
opportunity
but
i
still
have
one
man
who
loves
me
a
man
who
will
yet
stand
my
friend
and
defend
me
even
against
you
walter
murie
he
laughed
with
a
quick
gesture
of
disregard
you
believe
him
to
be
your
friend
recollect
my
dear
gabrielle
that
men
are
deceivers
ever
so
it
seems
in
your
case
she
exclaimed
with
poignant
bitterness
you
have
brought
scandalous
comment
upon
my
father
name
and
yet
you
are
utterly
unconcerned
because
as
i
have
already
told
you
your
father
is
my
friend
and
it
is
his
money
which
you
spend
so
freely
she
said
in
a
low
hard
voice
of
reproach
it
comes
from
him
his
money
he
exclaimed
quickly
what
do
you
mean
what
do
you
imply
simply
that
among
my
father
accounts
a
short
time
back
i
found
two
cheques
drawn
by
lady
heyburn
in
your
favour
and
you
told
your
father
of
them
of
course
he
exclaimed
with
sarcasm
a
remarkable
discovery
eh
i
told
him
nothing
was
her
bold
reply
not
because
i
wished
to
shield
you
but
because
i
did
not
wish
to
pain
him
unduly
he
has
worries
sufficient
in
all
conscience
your
devotion
is
really
most
charming
the
man
declared
calmly
leaning
against
the
table
and
examining
her
critically
from
head
to
foot
sir
henry
believes
in
you
you
are
his
dutiful
daughter
pure
good
and
all
that
he
sneered
i
wonder
what
he
would
say
if
he
well
if
he
knew
just
a
little
of
the
truth
of
what
happened
that
day
at
chantilly
the
truth
ah
and
you
would
tell
him
you
she
gasped
in
a
broken
voice
her
sweet
innocent
face
blanched
to
the
lips
in
an
instant
you
would
drag
my
good
name
into
the
mire
and
blast
my
life
for
ever
with
just
as
little
compunction
as
you
would
shoot
a
rabbit
i
know
i
know
you
only
too
well
flockart
i
stand
in
your
way
i
am
in
your
way
as
well
as
in
lady
heyburn
you
are
only
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
wreck
my
life
and
crush
me
once
i
am
away
from
here
my
poor
father
will
be
helpless
in
your
hands
dear
me
he
sneered
how
very
tragic
you
are
becoming
that
really
makes
you
appear
quite
like
a
heroine
of
provincial
melodrama
i
ought
now
to
have
a
revolver
and
threaten
you
and
then
this
scene
would
be
complete
for
the
stage
would
it
but
for
goodness
sake
do
remain
here
in
the
cold
any
longer
my
dear
little
girl
run
off
to
bed
and
forget
that
you
been
walking
in
your
sleep
not
until
i
see
that
safe
relocked
and
you
give
me
the
false
key
of
yours
if
you
will
not
then
you
shall
this
very
night
have
an
opportunity
of
telling
the
truth
to
my
father
i
am
prepared
to
bear
my
shame
and
all
its
consequences
the
words
froze
upon
her
pale
lips
on
the
lawn
outside
the
glass
door
there
was
at
that
moment
a
light
movement
the
tapping
of
a
hush
cried
flockart
remember
what
i
can
tell
him
if
i
choose
in
an
instant
she
saw
the
fragile
figure
of
her
father
in
soft
and
black
coat
creeping
almost
noiselessly
past
the
window
he
had
been
out
for
one
of
his
nocturnal
walks
for
he
sometimes
went
out
alone
when
suffering
from
insomnia
he
had
just
returned
the
blind
man
went
forward
only
a
few
paces
farther
but
finding
that
he
had
proceeded
too
far
he
returned
and
discovered
the
open
door
near
it
stood
the
pair
not
daring
now
to
move
lest
the
blind
man
quick
ears
should
detect
their
footsteps
gabrielle
gabrielle
my
dear
exclaimed
the
baronet
but
though
her
heart
beat
quickly
the
girl
did
not
reply
she
knew
however
that
the
old
man
could
almost
read
her
innermost
thoughts
the
ominous
words
of
flockart
rang
in
her
ears
yes
he
could
tell
a
terrible
and
awful
truth
which
must
be
concealed
at
all
hazards
i
felt
sure
i
heard
gabrielle
voice
how
curious
murmured
the
old
man
as
his
feet
fell
noiselessly
upon
the
thick
turkey
carpet
gabrielle
dear
he
called
but
his
daughter
stood
there
breathless
and
silent
not
daring
to
move
a
muscle
plain
it
was
that
while
passing
across
the
lawn
outside
he
heard
her
voice
he
had
overheard
her
declaration
that
she
was
prepared
to
bear
the
consequences
of
her
disgrace
across
the
room
the
blind
man
groped
his
hand
held
before
him
as
was
his
habit
strange
remarkably
strange
he
remarked
to
himself
quite
aloud
i
never
mistaken
in
gabrielle
voice
gabrielle
dear
where
are
you
why
do
you
speak
it
too
late
to
play
practical
jokes
flockart
knew
that
he
had
left
the
open
yet
he
dared
not
move
across
the
room
to
close
it
the
sightless
man
would
detect
the
slightest
movement
in
that
dead
silence
of
the
night
with
great
care
he
left
the
girl
side
and
a
single
stride
brought
him
to
the
large
where
he
secured
the
document
together
with
the
pencilled
memoranda
of
its
purport
both
of
which
he
slipped
into
his
pocket
unobserved
gabrielle
dared
not
breathe
her
discovery
there
meant
her
ruin
the
man
who
held
her
in
his
toils
cast
her
an
evil
threatening
glance
raising
his
clenched
fist
in
menace
as
though
daring
her
to
make
the
slightest
movement
in
his
dark
eyes
showed
a
sinister
expression
and
his
nether
lip
was
hard
she
was
alas
utterly
and
completely
in
his
power
the
safe
was
some
distance
away
and
in
order
to
reach
and
close
it
he
would
be
compelled
to
pass
the
man
in
blue
spectacles
now
standing
puzzled
and
surprised
in
the
centre
of
the
great
apartment
both
of
them
could
escape
by
the
open
window
but
to
do
so
would
be
to
court
discovery
should
the
baronet
find
his
safe
standing
open
in
that
case
the
alarm
would
be
raised
and
they
would
both
be
found
outside
the
house
instead
of
within
slowly
the
old
man
drew
his
thin
hand
across
his
furrowed
brow
and
then
as
a
sudden
recollection
dawned
upon
him
he
cried
ah
the
window
why
that
strange
when
i
went
out
i
closed
it
but
it
was
open
open
as
i
came
in
some
one
some
one
has
entered
here
in
my
absence
with
both
his
thin
wasted
hands
outstretched
he
walked
quickly
to
his
safe
cleverly
avoiding
the
furniture
in
his
course
and
next
second
discovered
that
the
iron
door
stood
wide
open
thieves
he
gasped
aloud
hoarsely
as
the
truth
dawned
upon
him
my
papers
gabrielle
voice
what
can
all
this
mean
and
next
moment
he
opened
the
door
crying
help
and
endeavouring
to
alarm
the
household
in
an
instant
flockart
dashed
forward
towards
the
safe
and
without
being
observed
by
gabrielle
had
slipped
the
key
into
his
own
pocket
gabrielle
cried
the
blind
man
you
are
here
in
the
room
i
know
you
are
you
can
not
deceive
me
i
smell
that
new
scent
which
your
aunt
annie
sent
you
upon
your
handkerchief
why
do
you
speak
to
me
yes
dad
she
answered
at
last
in
a
low
strained
voice
i
i
am
here
then
what
is
meant
by
my
safe
being
open
he
asked
sternly
as
all
that
goslin
had
told
him
a
little
while
before
flashed
across
his
memory
why
have
you
obtained
a
key
to
it
i
have
no
key
was
her
quick
answer
come
here
he
said
let
me
take
your
hand
with
great
reluctance
her
eyes
fixed
upon
flockart
face
she
did
as
she
was
bid
and
as
her
father
took
her
soft
hand
in
his
he
said
in
a
stern
harsh
tone
full
of
suspicion
and
quite
unusual
to
him
you
are
trembling
gabrielle
trembling
because
because
of
my
unexpected
appearance
eh
the
fair
girl
with
the
sweet
face
and
dainty
figure
was
silent
what
could
she
reply
chapter
xx
tells
of
flockart
triumph
what
are
you
doing
here
at
this
hour
gabrielle
father
demanded
slowly
releasing
her
hand
why
are
you
prying
into
my
affairs
he
had
not
detected
flockart
presence
and
believed
himself
alone
with
his
daughter
the
man
glance
again
met
gabrielle
and
she
saw
in
his
eyes
a
desperate
look
to
tell
the
truth
would
she
knew
alas
cause
the
exposure
of
her
secret
and
her
disgrace
on
both
sides
had
she
suddenly
become
hemmed
in
by
a
deadly
peril
dad
she
cried
suddenly
do
i
not
know
all
about
your
affairs
already
do
i
not
act
as
your
secretary
with
what
motive
should
i
open
your
safe
without
response
the
blind
man
moved
back
to
the
open
door
and
placing
his
hand
within
fingered
one
of
the
long
iron
drawers
it
was
unlocked
and
he
drew
it
forth
some
papers
were
within
blue
papers
which
his
daughter
had
never
seen
yes
he
exclaimed
aloud
just
as
i
thought
this
drawer
has
been
opened
and
my
private
affairs
pried
into
tell
me
gabrielle
where
is
young
murie
just
at
present
in
paris
i
believe
he
left
london
unexpectedly
three
days
ago
paris
echoed
the
old
man
ah
he
added
goslin
was
right
quite
right
and
so
you
my
daughter
in
whom
i
placed
all
my
trust
my
my
only
friend
have
betrayed
me
he
added
brokenly
i
have
not
betrayed
you
dear
father
was
her
quick
protest
to
whom
do
you
allege
i
have
exposed
your
affairs
to
your
lover
walter
to
flockart
whose
wits
were
already
at
work
upon
some
scheme
to
extricate
himself
there
came
at
that
instant
a
sudden
suggestion
he
spoke
causing
the
old
man
to
start
suddenly
and
turn
in
the
direction
of
the
speaker
as
the
words
left
his
lips
he
raised
a
threatening
finger
towards
gabrielle
a
sign
of
silence
to
her
of
which
the
old
man
was
unfortunately
in
ignorance
i
think
sir
henry
that
i
ought
to
speak
to
tell
you
the
truth
painful
though
it
may
be
five
minutes
ago
i
came
down
here
in
order
to
get
a
as
i
wanted
to
send
a
wire
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
when
to
my
surprise
i
saw
a
light
beneath
the
door
i
oh
no
no
gasped
the
girl
in
horrified
protest
it
a
lie
i
crept
in
quietly
and
was
very
surprised
to
find
gabrielle
with
the
safe
open
and
alone
i
had
expected
that
she
was
sitting
up
late
working
with
you
but
she
seemed
to
be
examining
and
reading
some
papers
she
took
from
a
drawer
forgive
me
for
telling
you
this
but
the
truth
must
now
be
made
plain
i
startled
her
by
my
sudden
presence
and
pointing
out
the
dishonour
of
copying
her
father
papers
no
matter
for
what
purpose
i
compelled
her
to
return
the
documents
to
their
place
i
fold
her
frankly
that
it
was
my
duty
as
your
friend
to
inform
you
of
the
incident
but
she
implored
me
for
the
sake
of
her
lover
to
remain
silent
mr
flockart
cried
the
girl
how
dare
you
say
such
a
thing
when
you
know
it
to
be
an
untruth
when
enough
exclaimed
her
father
bitterly
i
ashamed
of
you
gabrielle
i
i
would
beg
of
you
sir
henry
not
further
to
distress
yourself
flockart
interrupted
love
as
you
know
often
prompts
both
men
and
women
to
commit
acts
of
supreme
folly
folly
echoed
the
blind
man
this
is
more
than
folly
gabrielle
and
her
lover
have
conspired
to
bring
about
my
ruin
i
have
had
suspicions
for
several
weeks
now
alas
they
are
confirmed
walter
murie
is
in
paris
at
this
moment
in
order
to
make
money
out
of
the
secret
knowledge
which
gabrielle
obtains
for
him
my
own
daughter
is
responsible
for
my
betrayal
he
added
in
a
voice
broken
by
emotion
no
no
sir
henry
urged
flockart
surely
the
outlook
is
not
so
black
as
you
foresee
gabrielle
has
acted
injudiciously
but
surely
she
is
still
devoted
to
you
and
your
interests
yes
cried
the
girl
in
desperation
you
know
i
am
dad
you
know
that
i
it
is
useless
flockart
for
you
to
endeavour
to
seek
forgiveness
for
gabrielle
declared
her
father
in
a
firm
harsh
voice
quite
useless
she
has
even
endeavoured
to
deny
the
statement
you
have
made
tried
to
deny
it
when
i
actually
heard
with
my
own
ears
her
defiant
declaration
that
she
was
prepared
to
bear
her
shame
and
all
its
consequences
let
her
do
so
i
say
she
shall
leave
glencardine
and
have
no
further
opportunity
to
conspire
against
me
oh
father
what
are
you
saying
she
cried
in
despair
bursting
into
tears
i
have
not
conspired
i
am
saying
the
truth
went
on
the
blind
man
you
and
your
lover
have
formed
another
clever
plot
eh
because
i
have
not
sight
to
watch
you
you
will
copy
my
business
reports
and
send
them
to
walter
murie
who
hopes
to
place
them
in
a
certain
channel
where
he
can
receive
payment
this
is
not
the
first
time
my
business
has
leaked
out
from
this
room
only
a
short
time
ago
certain
confidential
documents
were
offered
to
the
greek
government
but
fortunately
they
were
false
ones
prepared
on
purpose
to
trick
any
one
who
had
designs
upon
my
business
secrets
i
swear
i
am
in
ignorance
of
it
all
well
i
have
now
told
you
plainly
the
old
man
said
i
loved
you
gabrielle
and
until
this
moment
foolishly
believed
that
you
were
devoted
to
me
and
to
my
interests
i
trusted
you
implicitly
but
you
have
betrayed
me
into
the
hands
of
my
enemies
betrayed
me
he
wailed
in
such
a
manner
that
only
ruin
may
face
me
i
tell
you
the
hard
and
bitter
truth
i
am
blind
and
ever
since
your
return
from
school
you
have
acted
as
my
secretary
and
i
have
looked
at
the
world
only
through
your
eyes
ah
he
sighed
but
i
ought
to
have
known
i
should
never
have
trusted
a
woman
even
though
she
be
my
own
daughter
the
girl
stood
with
her
blanched
face
covered
by
her
hands
to
protest
to
declare
that
flockart
story
was
a
lie
was
she
saw
all
to
no
purpose
her
father
had
overheard
her
bold
defiance
and
had
alas
most
unfortunately
taken
it
as
an
admission
of
her
guilt
flockart
stood
motionless
but
watchful
yet
by
the
few
words
he
uttered
he
succeeded
in
impressing
the
blind
man
with
the
genuineness
of
his
friendship
both
for
father
and
for
daughter
he
urged
forgiveness
but
sir
henry
disregarded
all
his
appeals
no
he
declared
it
is
fortunate
indeed
flockart
that
you
made
this
discovery
and
thus
placed
me
upon
my
guard
the
poor
deluded
man
little
dreamt
that
on
the
occasion
when
flockart
had
taken
him
down
the
drive
to
announce
his
departure
from
glencardine
on
account
of
the
gossip
and
had
drawn
sir
henry
attention
to
his
hanging
he
had
succeeded
in
cleverly
obtaining
two
impressions
of
the
attached
in
his
excitement
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
ask
his
daughter
by
what
means
she
had
been
able
to
open
that
steel
door
dad
she
faltered
advancing
towards
him
and
placing
her
soft
tender
hand
upon
his
shoulder
wo
you
listen
to
reason
i
assure
you
i
am
quite
innocent
of
any
attempt
or
intention
to
betray
you
i
know
you
have
many
enemies
and
she
glanced
quickly
in
flockart
direction
have
we
not
often
discussed
them
have
i
not
kept
eyes
and
ears
open
and
told
you
of
all
i
have
seen
and
learnt
have
you
have
seen
and
learnt
what
is
to
my
detriment
he
answered
all
argument
is
useless
a
fortnight
or
so
ago
by
your
aid
my
enemies
secured
a
copy
of
a
certain
document
which
has
never
left
yonder
safe
flockart
has
discovered
you
again
tampering
with
my
safe
and
with
my
own
ears
i
heard
you
utter
defiance
you
are
more
devoted
to
your
lover
than
to
me
and
you
are
supplying
him
with
copies
of
my
papers
that
is
untrue
dad
protested
the
girl
reproachfully
but
her
father
shook
her
hand
roughly
from
his
shoulder
saying
i
have
already
told
you
my
decision
which
is
irrevocable
you
shall
leave
glencardine
and
go
to
your
aunt
emily
at
woodnewton
you
have
much
opportunity
for
mischief
in
that
dull
little
northampton
village
i
wo
allow
you
to
remain
under
my
roof
any
longer
you
are
too
ungrateful
and
deceitful
knowing
as
you
do
the
misery
of
my
affliction
but
father
go
to
your
room
he
ordered
sternly
tomorrow
i
will
speak
with
your
mother
and
we
shall
then
decide
what
shall
be
done
only
understand
one
thing
in
the
future
you
are
not
my
dear
daughter
that
you
have
been
in
the
past
i
i
have
no
daughter
he
added
in
a
voice
harsh
yet
broken
by
emotion
for
you
have
now
proved
yourself
an
enemy
worse
even
than
those
who
for
so
many
years
have
taken
advantage
of
my
helplessness
ah
dad
dad
you
are
cruel
she
cried
bursting
again
into
a
torrent
of
tears
you
are
too
cruel
i
have
done
nothing
do
you
call
placing
me
in
peril
nothing
he
retorted
bitterly
go
to
your
room
at
once
remain
with
me
flockart
i
want
to
speak
to
you
the
girl
saw
herself
convicted
by
those
unfortunate
words
she
had
used
words
meant
in
defiance
of
her
flockart
but
which
had
placed
her
in
ignominy
and
disgrace
ah
if
she
could
only
stand
firm
and
speak
the
ghastly
truth
but
alas
she
dared
not
flockart
the
man
who
held
her
in
his
power
the
man
whom
she
knew
to
be
her
bitterest
opponent
a
cheat
and
a
fraud
stood
there
triumphant
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
while
she
pure
honest
and
devoted
to
that
afflicted
man
was
denounced
and
outcast
she
raised
her
voice
in
one
last
word
of
faint
protest
but
her
father
angered
and
grieved
turned
fiercely
upon
her
and
ordered
her
from
his
presence
go
he
said
and
do
not
come
near
me
again
until
your
boxes
are
packed
and
you
are
ready
to
leave
glencardine
you
speak
as
though
i
were
a
servant
whom
you
discharged
she
said
bitterly
i
am
speaking
to
my
enemy
not
to
my
daughter
was
his
hard
response
she
raised
her
eyes
to
flockart
and
saw
upon
his
dark
face
a
hard
look
what
hope
of
salvation
could
she
ever
expect
from
that
man
the
man
who
long
ago
had
sought
to
estrange
her
from
her
father
so
that
he
might
work
his
own
ends
it
was
upon
her
tongue
to
turn
upon
him
and
relate
the
whole
infamous
truth
yet
so
friendly
had
the
two
men
become
of
late
that
she
feared
even
if
she
did
so
that
her
father
would
only
see
in
the
revelation
an
attempt
at
reprisal
besides
what
if
flockart
spoke
what
if
he
told
the
awful
truth
her
own
dear
father
whom
she
loved
so
well
even
though
he
had
misjudged
her
would
be
dragged
into
the
mire
no
she
was
the
victim
of
that
man
who
was
a
of
the
art
of
subterfuge
the
man
who
for
years
had
lived
by
his
wits
and
preyed
upon
society
leave
us
and
go
to
your
room
again
commanded
her
father
she
looked
sadly
at
the
white
bespectacled
countenance
which
she
loved
so
well
her
soft
hand
once
more
sought
his
but
he
cast
it
from
him
saying
enough
of
your
caresses
you
are
no
longer
my
daughter
leave
us
and
then
seeing
all
protest
in
vain
she
sighed
turned
very
slowly
and
with
a
last
lingering
look
upon
the
helpless
man
to
whom
she
had
been
so
devoted
and
who
now
so
grossly
misjudged
her
she
tottered
out
closing
the
door
behind
her
has
she
gone
asked
sir
henry
a
moment
later
flockart
responded
in
the
affirmative
laying
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
his
agitated
host
and
urging
him
to
remain
calm
that
all
very
well
my
dear
flockart
he
cried
but
you
do
know
what
she
has
done
she
exposed
a
week
or
so
ago
a
most
confidential
arrangement
with
the
greek
government
a
revelation
which
might
have
involved
me
in
the
loss
of
over
a
hundred
thousand
then
it
fortunate
perhaps
that
i
discovered
her
replied
his
guest
all
this
must
be
very
painful
to
you
sir
henry
very
i
shall
not
give
her
another
opportunity
to
betray
me
flockart
depend
upon
that
the
elder
man
said
my
wife
warned
me
against
gabrielle
long
ago
i
now
see
that
i
was
a
fool
for
not
taking
her
advice
certainly
it
a
curious
fact
that
walter
murie
is
in
paris
remarked
the
other
was
the
revelation
of
your
financial
dealings
made
in
paris
do
you
know
yes
it
was
snapped
the
blind
man
i
believed
walter
to
be
quite
a
good
young
fellow
ah
i
knew
different
sir
henry
his
life
up
in
london
was
not
well
not
exactly
all
that
it
should
be
he
in
with
a
rather
shady
crowd
you
never
told
me
so
because
you
did
not
believe
me
to
be
your
friend
until
quite
recently
i
hope
i
have
now
proved
what
i
have
asserted
if
i
can
do
anything
to
assist
you
i
am
only
too
ready
i
assure
you
that
you
have
only
to
command
me
sir
henry
reflected
deeply
for
a
few
moments
the
discovery
that
his
daughter
was
playing
him
false
caused
within
him
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
unfortunately
he
could
not
see
the
expression
upon
the
countenance
of
his
false
friend
he
was
wondering
at
that
moment
whether
he
might
entrust
to
him
a
somewhat
delicate
mission
gabrielle
shall
not
return
here
her
father
said
as
though
speaking
to
himself
that
is
a
course
which
i
would
most
strongly
advise
send
the
girl
away
urged
the
other
evidently
she
has
grossly
betrayed
you
that
i
certainly
intend
doing
was
the
answer
but
i
wonder
flockart
if
i
might
take
you
at
your
word
and
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favour
i
am
so
helpless
or
i
would
not
think
of
troubling
you
only
tell
me
what
you
wish
and
i
will
do
it
with
pleasure
very
well
then
replied
the
blind
man
perhaps
i
shall
want
you
to
go
to
paris
at
once
watch
the
actions
of
young
murie
and
report
to
me
from
time
to
time
would
you
a
look
of
bright
intelligence
overspread
the
man
features
as
a
new
vista
opened
before
him
sir
henry
was
about
to
take
him
into
his
confidence
why
with
pleasure
he
said
cheerily
i
start
and
rest
assured
that
i
keep
a
very
good
eye
upon
the
young
gentleman
you
now
know
the
painful
truth
concerning
your
daughter
the
truth
which
lady
heyburn
has
told
you
so
often
and
which
you
have
never
yet
heeded
yes
flockart
answered
the
afflicted
man
taking
his
guest
hand
in
warm
friendship
i
once
disliked
you
that
i
admit
but
you
were
quite
frank
the
other
day
and
now
you
have
succeeded
in
making
a
discovery
that
though
it
has
upset
me
terribly
may
mean
my
salvation
chapter
xxi
through
the
mists
sir
henry
refused
to
speak
with
his
daughter
when
on
the
following
morning
she
stole
in
and
laid
her
hand
softly
upon
his
arm
he
ordered
her
in
a
tone
quite
unusual
to
leave
the
library
through
the
morning
hours
she
had
lain
awake
trying
to
make
a
resolve
but
alas
she
dared
not
tell
the
truth
she
was
in
deadly
fear
of
flockart
reprisals
that
morning
at
nine
lady
heyburn
and
flockart
had
held
hurried
consultation
in
secret
at
which
he
had
explained
to
her
what
had
occurred
excellent
she
had
remarked
briefly
but
we
must
now
have
a
care
my
dear
friend
mind
the
girl
does
not
throw
all
prudence
to
the
winds
and
turn
upon
us
bah
he
laughed
i
do
fear
that
for
a
single
second
and
he
left
the
room
again
to
salute
her
in
the
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
as
though
they
had
not
met
before
that
day
gabrielle
on
leaving
her
father
went
out
for
a
long
walk
alone
away
over
the
hills
for
hours
she
went
on
jock
her
aberdeen
terrier
toddling
at
her
side
in
her
hand
a
stout
regardless
of
the
muddy
roads
or
the
wet
weather
it
was
grey
damp
and
dismal
one
of
those
days
which
in
the
highlands
are
often
so
very
cheerless
and
dispiriting
yet
on
and
still
on
she
went
her
mind
full
of
the
events
of
the
previous
night
full
also
of
the
dread
secret
which
prevented
her
from
exposing
her
father
false
friend
in
order
to
save
her
father
should
she
sacrifice
herself
sacrifice
her
own
life
that
was
the
one
problem
before
her
she
saw
nothing
she
heeded
nothing
hunger
or
fatigue
troubled
her
not
indeed
she
took
no
notice
of
where
her
footsteps
led
her
beyond
crieff
she
wandered
along
the
a
short
distance
ascending
a
hill
where
a
wild
and
wonderful
view
spread
before
her
there
she
sat
down
upon
a
big
boulder
to
rest
her
hair
blown
by
the
chill
wind
she
sat
staring
straight
before
her
thinking
ever
thinking
she
had
not
seen
lady
heyburn
that
day
she
had
seen
no
one
at
six
that
morning
she
had
written
a
long
letter
to
walter
murie
she
had
not
mentioned
the
midnight
incident
but
she
had
with
many
expressions
of
regret
pointed
out
the
futility
of
any
further
affection
between
them
she
had
not
attempted
to
excuse
herself
she
merely
told
him
that
she
considered
herself
unworthy
of
his
love
and
because
of
that
and
that
alone
she
had
decided
to
break
off
their
engagement
a
dozen
times
she
had
reread
the
letter
after
she
had
completed
it
surely
it
was
the
letter
of
a
and
desperate
woman
would
he
take
it
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
meant
she
wondered
she
loved
him
ah
loved
him
better
than
any
one
else
in
all
the
world
but
she
now
saw
that
it
was
useless
to
masquerade
any
longer
the
blow
had
fallen
and
it
had
crushed
her
she
was
powerless
to
resist
powerless
to
deny
the
false
charge
against
her
powerless
to
tell
the
truth
that
letter
which
she
knew
must
come
as
a
cruel
blow
to
walter
she
had
given
to
the
postman
with
her
own
hands
and
it
was
now
on
its
way
south
as
she
sat
on
the
summit
of
that
hill
she
was
wondering
what
effect
her
written
words
would
have
upon
him
he
had
loved
her
so
devotedly
ever
since
they
had
been
children
together
well
she
knew
how
strong
was
his
passion
for
her
how
his
life
was
at
her
disposal
she
knew
that
on
reading
those
despairing
lines
of
hers
he
would
be
staggered
she
recalled
the
dear
face
of
her
his
hot
kisses
his
soft
terms
of
endearment
and
alone
there
with
none
to
witness
her
bitter
grief
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
the
sad
greyness
of
the
landscape
was
in
keeping
with
her
own
great
sorrow
she
had
lost
all
that
was
dear
to
her
and
young
as
she
was
with
hardly
any
experience
of
the
world
and
its
ways
she
was
already
the
victim
of
grim
circumstance
broken
by
the
grief
of
a
love
gnawing
at
her
true
heart
the
knowledge
that
lady
heyburn
and
flockart
would
exult
over
her
downfall
and
exile
to
that
tiny
house
in
a
sleepy
little
northamptonshire
village
did
not
trouble
her
her
enemies
had
triumphed
she
had
played
the
game
and
lost
just
as
she
might
have
lost
at
billiards
or
at
bridge
for
she
was
a
thorough
sportswoman
she
only
grieved
because
she
saw
the
grave
peril
of
her
dear
father
and
because
she
now
foresaw
the
utter
hopelessness
of
her
own
happiness
it
was
better
she
reflected
far
better
that
she
should
go
into
the
dull
and
dreary
exile
of
an
english
village
with
the
unexciting
companionship
of
aunt
emily
an
ascetic
spinster
of
the
era
and
make
pretence
of
pique
with
walter
than
to
reveal
to
him
the
shameful
truth
he
would
at
least
in
those
circumstances
retain
of
her
a
recollection
fond
and
tender
he
would
not
despise
nor
hate
her
as
he
most
certainly
would
do
if
he
knew
the
real
astounding
facts
how
long
she
remained
there
high
up
with
the
chill
winds
of
autumn
tossing
her
silky
hair
she
knew
not
rainclouds
were
gathering
and
the
rugged
hill
before
her
was
now
hidden
behind
a
bank
of
mist
time
had
crept
on
without
her
heeding
it
for
what
did
time
now
matter
to
her
what
indeed
did
anything
matter
her
young
life
though
she
was
still
in
her
teens
had
ended
or
at
least
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
it
had
was
she
not
calmly
and
coolly
contemplating
telling
the
truth
and
putting
an
end
to
her
existence
after
saving
her
honour
her
sad
tearful
eyes
gazed
slowly
about
her
as
she
suddenly
awakened
to
the
fact
that
she
was
far
very
far
from
home
she
had
been
dazed
unconscious
of
everything
because
of
the
heavy
burden
of
grief
within
her
heart
but
now
she
looked
forth
upon
the
small
grey
loch
with
its
dark
fringe
of
trees
the
grey
and
purple
hills
beyond
the
grey
sky
and
the
grey
filmy
mists
that
hung
everywhere
the
world
was
indeed
sad
and
gloomy
and
even
jock
sat
looking
up
at
his
young
mistress
as
though
regarding
her
grief
in
wonder
now
and
then
distant
shots
came
from
across
the
hills
they
were
shooting
over
the
drummond
estate
she
knew
for
she
had
had
an
invitation
to
join
their
that
day
lady
heyburn
and
flockart
had
no
doubt
gone
that
she
told
herself
was
her
last
day
in
the
highlands
that
picturesque
breezy
country
she
loved
so
well
it
was
her
last
day
amid
those
familiar
places
where
she
and
walter
had
so
often
wandered
together
and
where
he
had
told
her
of
his
passionate
devotion
well
perhaps
it
was
best
after
all
down
south
she
would
not
be
reminded
of
him
every
moment
and
at
every
turn
no
she
sighed
within
herself
as
she
rose
to
descend
the
hill
she
must
steel
herself
against
her
own
sad
reflections
she
must
learn
how
to
forget
what
will
he
say
she
murmured
aloud
as
she
went
down
with
jock
frisking
and
barking
before
her
what
will
he
think
of
me
when
he
gets
my
letter
he
will
believe
me
fickle
he
will
believe
that
i
have
another
lover
that
is
certain
well
i
must
allow
him
to
believe
it
we
have
parted
and
we
must
now
alas
remain
apart
for
ever
probably
he
will
seek
from
my
father
the
truth
concerning
my
disappearance
from
glencardine
dad
will
tell
him
no
doubt
and
then
then
what
will
he
believe
he
he
will
know
that
i
am
unworthy
to
be
his
wife
yet
yet
is
it
not
cruel
that
i
dare
not
speak
the
truth
and
clear
myself
of
this
foul
charge
of
betraying
my
own
dear
father
was
ever
a
girl
placed
in
such
a
position
as
myself
i
wonder
has
any
girl
ever
loved
a
man
better
than
i
love
walter
her
white
lips
were
set
hard
and
her
fine
eyes
became
again
bedimmed
by
tears
it
commenced
to
rain
that
fine
drizzle
so
often
experienced
north
of
the
tweed
but
she
heeded
not
she
was
used
to
it
to
get
wet
through
was
to
her
quite
a
frequent
occurrence
when
out
fishing
though
there
was
no
path
she
knew
her
way
and
walking
through
the
wet
heather
she
came
after
out
upon
a
muddy
byroad
which
led
her
into
the
town
of
crieff
whence
her
return
was
easy
though
it
was
already
dusk
and
the
had
gone
before
she
the
house
by
the
servants
door
and
slipped
unobserved
up
to
her
own
room
elise
found
her
seated
in
her
blue
gown
before
the
welcome
her
chin
upon
her
breast
her
excuse
was
that
she
felt
unwell
therefore
one
of
the
maids
brought
her
some
dinner
on
a
tray
upon
the
mantelshelf
were
many
photographs
some
of
them
of
her
schoolfellows
and
souvenirs
of
holidays
the
odds
and
ends
of
portraits
and
scenes
which
every
girl
unconsciously
collects
among
them
in
a
plain
silver
frame
was
the
picture
of
walter
murie
taken
in
new
york
only
a
few
weeks
before
upon
the
frame
was
engraved
gabrielle
from
walter
she
took
it
in
her
hand
and
stood
for
a
long
time
motionless
never
again
alas
would
she
look
upon
that
face
so
dear
to
her
her
young
heart
was
already
broken
because
she
was
held
fettered
and
powerless
at
last
she
put
down
the
portrait
and
sinking
into
her
chair
sat
crying
bitterly
now
that
she
was
outcast
by
her
father
to
whom
she
had
been
always
such
a
close
devoted
friend
her
life
was
an
absolute
blank
at
one
blow
she
had
lost
both
lover
and
father
already
elise
had
told
her
that
she
had
received
instructions
to
pack
her
trunks
the
frenchwoman
was
apparently
much
puzzled
at
the
order
which
lady
heyburn
had
given
her
and
had
asked
the
girl
whom
she
intended
to
visit
the
maid
had
asked
what
dresses
she
would
require
but
gabrielle
replied
that
she
might
pack
what
she
liked
for
a
long
visit
the
girl
could
hear
elise
moving
about
shaking
out
skirts
in
the
adjoining
room
and
making
preparations
for
her
departure
on
the
morrow
despondent
hopeless
she
sat
before
the
fire
for
a
long
time
she
had
locked
the
door
and
switched
off
the
light
for
it
irritated
her
she
loved
the
uncertain
light
of
dancing
flames
and
sat
huddled
there
in
her
big
chair
for
the
last
time
she
was
reflecting
upon
her
own
brief
life
scarcely
out
of
the
schoolroom
she
had
lived
most
of
her
days
up
in
that
dear
old
place
where
every
inch
of
the
big
estate
was
so
familiar
to
her
she
remembered
all
those
happy
days
at
school
first
in
england
and
then
in
france
with
the
sisters
in
their
spotless
and
the
quiet
happy
life
of
the
convent
the
calm
grave
face
of
sister
marguerite
looked
down
upon
her
from
the
mantelshelf
as
if
sympathising
with
her
pretty
pupil
in
those
troubles
that
had
so
early
come
to
her
she
raised
her
eyes
and
saw
the
portrait
its
sight
aroused
within
her
a
new
thought
and
fresh
recollection
had
not
sister
marguerite
always
taught
her
to
beseech
the
almighty
aid
when
in
doubt
or
when
in
trouble
those
grave
solemn
words
of
the
mother
superior
rang
in
her
ears
and
she
fell
upon
her
knees
beside
her
narrow
bed
in
the
alcove
and
with
murmuring
lips
prayed
for
divine
support
and
assistance
she
raised
her
sweet
troubled
face
to
heaven
and
made
confession
to
her
maker
then
after
a
long
silence
she
struggled
again
to
her

took
up
walter
portrait
and
kissing
it
put
it
away
carefully
in
a
drawer
some
of
her
little
treasures
she
gathered
together
and
placed
with
it
preparatory
to
departure
for
she
would
on
the
morrow
leave
glencardine
perhaps
for
ever
the
had
struck
ten
to
where
she
stood
came
the
strident
sounds
of
the
mechanical
for
some
of
the
gay
party
were
waltzing
in
the
hall
their
merry
shouts
and
laughter
were
discordant
to
her
ears
what
cared
any
of
those
friends
of
her
if
she
were
in
disgrace
and
an
outcast
drawing
aside
the
curtain
she
saw
that
the
night
was
bright
and
starlit
she
preferred
the
air
out
in
the
park
to
the
sounds
of
gaiety
within
that
house
which
was
no
longer
to
be
her
home
therefore
she
slipped
on
a
skirt
and
blouse
and
throwing
her
across
her
shoulders
and
a
shawl
over
her
head
she
crept
past
the
room
wherein
elise
was
packing
her
belongings
and
down
the
to
the
lawn
the
sound
of
the
laughter
of
the
men
and
women
of
the
aroused
a
poignant
bitterness
within
her
as
she
passed
across
the
drive
she
saw
a
light
in
the
library
where
no
doubt
her
father
was
sitting
in
his
loneliness
feeling
and
examining
his
collection
of
she
turned
and
walking
straight
on
struck
the
gravelled
path
which
took
her
to
the
castle
ruins
not
until
the
black
ponderous
walls
rose
before
her
did
she
awaken
to
a
consciousness
of
her
whereabouts
then
entering
the
ruined
courtyard
she
halted
and
listened
all
was
dark
above
the
stars
twinkled
brightly
and
in
the
ivy
the
stirred
the
leaves
holding
her
breath
she
strained
her
ears
yes
she
was
not
deceived
there
were
sounds
distinct
and
undeniable
she
was
fascinated
listening
again
to
those
that
were
always
precursory
of
death
the
fatal
whispers

the

and
gone
back
to
their
villas
and
hotels
dull

found
no

in

circle
most
of
the
people
were
those
she
knew
in
london
or
in

including
a
sprinkling
of
cosmopolitans
a
russian

notorious
for

did
lady
heyburn
looked
upon

winter
visit
to
that
beautiful
villa
overlooking
the
calm
sapphire
sea
as
her
annual
emancipation
henry
was
a
dear
old
fellow
she
openly
confided
to
her
friends
but
his
affliction
made
him
terribly
trying
but
jimmy
flockart
the
amusing
idler
was
living
down
at
the
savoy
and
was
daily
in
her
company
driving
motoring
picnicking
making
excursions
in
the
mountains
or
taking
trips
over
to
monte
by
the
he
had
left
the
villa
early
in
the
afternoon
returned
to
his
hotel
changed
his
smart
flannels
for
a
tweed
suit
and
taking
a
stout
stick
had
set
off
alone
for
his
daily
constitutional
along
the
in
the
direction
of
that
pretty
but
little
ospedaletti
straight
before
him
into
the
unruffled
tideless
sea
the
sun
was
sinking
in
all
its
glory
as
he
went
at
swinging
pace
along
the
white
dusty
road
past
the
barrier
and
out
into
the
country
where
on
the
left
the
waves
lazily
lapped
the
grey
rocks
while
upon
the
right
the
fertile
slopes
were
covered
with
carnations
and
violets
growing
for
the
markets
of
paris
and
london
in
the
air
was
a
delightful
perfume
the
freshness
of
the
sea
in
combination
with
the
sweetness
of
the
flowers
a
big
red
dashed
suddenly
round
a
corner
raising
a
cloud
of
dust
an
american
party
were
on
their
way
from
genoa
to
the
frontier
along
the
corniche
one
of
the
most
picturesque
routes
in
all
the
world
james
flockart
had
no
eyes
for
beauty
he
was
too
occupied
by
certain
grave
apprehensions
that
morning
he
had
walked
in
the
garden
with
lady
heyburn
and
had
a
long
chat
with
her
her
attitude
had
been
peculiar
he
could
not
make
her
out
she
had
begged
him
to
promise
to
leave
san
remo
and
when
asked
to
tell
the
reason
of
this
sudden
demand
she
had
firmly
refused
you
must
leave
here
jimmy
she
had
said
quite
calmly
go
down
to
rome
to
palermo
to
ragusa
or
somewhere
where
you
can
put
in
a
month
or
so
in
comfort
the
villa
igiea
at
palermo
would
suit
you
quite
well
lots
of
smart
people
and
very
decent
cooking
well
he
laughed
as
far
as
hotels
go
nothing
could
be
worse
than
this
place
i
never
put
my
nose
into
this
hole
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
you
come
here
there
is
a
hotel
worth
the
name
when
one
goes
to
monte
or
cannes
or
even
decaying
nice
one
can
get
decent
cooking
but
here
ugh
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
price
higher
than
the
in
paris
food
rooms
cheaply
decorated
and
a
dullness
unequalled
my
dear
jimmy
laughed
her
ladyship
you
such
a
cosmopolitan
that
you
incorrigible
i
know
you
do
like
this
place
you
been
here
six
weeks
so
go
you
had
a
letter
from
the
old
man
eh
yes
i
have
she
replied
and
he
saw
that
her
countenance
changed
but
she
would
say
nothing
more
she
had
decided
that
he
must
leave
san
remo
and
would
hear
no
argument
to
the
contrary
the
southern
sun
sank
slowly
into
the
sea
now
grey
but
waveless
on
the
horizon
lay
the
long
of
a
passing
steamer
eastward
bound
he
had
rounded
the
steep
rocky
headland
and
in
the
hollow
before
him
nestled
the
little
village
of
ospedaletti
with
its
closed
casino
its
rows
of
small
villas
and
its
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
he
saw
the
figure
of
a
rather
shabby
man
in
a
faded
grey
overcoat
and
grey
soft
of
the
mode
usual
on
the
riviera
but
discoloured
by
long
wear
leaning
upon
the
low
and
smoking
a
cigarette
no
other
person
was
in
the
vicinity
and
it
was
quickly
evident
from
the
manner
in
which
the
wayfarer
recognised
him
and
came
forward
to
meet
him
with
outstretched
hand
that
they
had
met
by
appointment
short
of
stature
as
he
was
with
fair
hair
colourless
eyes
and
a
fair
moustache
his
slouching
appearance
was
that
of
one
who
had
seen
better
days
even
though
there
still
remained
about
him
a
vestige
of
dandyism
the
close
observer
would
however
detect
that
his
clothes
shabby
though
they
were
were
of
foreign
cut
and
that
his
greeting
was
of
that
demonstrative
character
that
betrayed
his
foreign
birth
well
my
dear
krail
exclaimed
flockart
after
they
had
shaken
hands
and
stood
together
leaning
upon
the
you
got
my
wire
in
huntingdon
i
was
uncertain
whether
you
were
at
the
or
at
the
so
i
sent
a
message
to
both
i
was
at
the
and
left
an
hour
after
receipt
of
your
wire
well
tell
me
what
has
happened
how
are
things
up
at
glencardine
goslin
is
with
the
old
fellow
he
has
taken
the
girl
place
as
his
confidential
secretary
was
the
shabby
man
reply
speaking
with
a
foreign
accent
walter
murie
was
at
home
for
christmas
but
went
to
cairo
and
how
are
matters
in
paris
they
are
working
hard
but
it
an
uphill
pull
the
old
man
is
a
crafty
old
bird
those
papers
you
got
from
the
safe
had
been
cunningly
prepared
for
anybody
who
sought
to
obtain
information
the
consequence
is
that
we
shown
our
hand
and
heavily
handicapped
ourselves
thereby
you
told
me
all
that
when
you
were
down
here
a
month
ago
flockart
said
impatiently
you
did
believe
me
then
you
do
now
i
suppose
i
never
denied
it
flockart
declared
offering
the
stranger
a
russian
cigarette
from
his
gold
case
i
was
completely
misled
and
by
the
girl
also
the
girl
influence
with
her
father
is
happily
quite
at
an
end
remarked
the
shabby
man
i
saw
her
last
week
in
woodnewton
the
change
from
glencardine
to
an
cottage
in
a
village
street
must
be
rather
severe
only
what
she
deserves
snapped
flockart
she
defied
us
granted
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
we
have
played
a
very
fair
game
said
the
man
remember
she
only
a
girl
but
dangerous
to
us
and
to
our
plans
my
dear
krail
she
knows
a
lot
because
well
forgive
me
for
saying
so
my
dear
flockart
because
you
been
a
fool
and
have
allowed
her
to
know
it
was
i
it
was
the
woman
lady
heyburn
why
i
always
believed
her
to
be
the
soul
of
discretion
she
been
too
defiant
of
consequences
a
dozen
times
i
warned
her
but
she
will
not
heed
then
she
land
herself
in
a
deep
hole
if
she
is
careful
replied
the
foreigner
speaking
very
fair
english
does
she
know
i
here
of
course
not
if
we
to
play
the
game
she
must
know
nothing
already
inclined
to
throw
prudence
to
the
winds
and
to
confess
all
to
her
husband
confess
gasped
the
stranger
paling
beneath
his
rather
sallow
skin
bacco
she
not
going
to
be
such
an
idiot
surely
we
were
run
so
close
and
so
narrowly
escaped
discovery
after
i
got
at
those
papers
at
glencardine
that
she
seems
to
have
lost
heart
flockart
remarked
but
if
she
acted
the
fool
and
told
sir
henry
it
would
mean
ruin
for
us
and
that
would
also
mean
it
would
mean
exposure
for
gabrielle
interrupted
flockart
the
old
man
dare
not
lift
his
voice
for
his
daughter
sake
ah
exclaimed
krail
that
just
where
you
acted
injudiciously
you
set
him
against
her
therefore
he
would
spare
her
it
was
imperative
i
could
afford
to
be
found
prying
into
the
old
man
papers
could
i
i
got
impressions
of
his
key
while
walking
in
the
park
one
day
he
never
suspected
it
of
course
not
he
believes
in
you
laughed
his
friend
as
one
of
the
few
upright
men
who
are
his
friends
but
he
added
you
done
wrong
my
dear
fellow
to
trust
a
woman
with
a
secret
depend
upon
it
her
ladyship
will
let
you
down
well
if
she
does
remarked
flockart
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
she
have
to
suffer
with
me
you
know
where
we
should
all
find
ourselves
the
man
pulled
a
wry
face
and
puffed
at
his
cigarette
in
silence
what
does
the
girl
do
asked
flockart
a
few
moments
later
well
she
seems
to
have
a
pretty
dull
time
with
the
old
lady
i
stayed
at
the
arms
at
woodnewton
for
two
days
a
miserable
little
place
and
watched
her
pretty
closely
she
out
a
good
deal
rambling
alone
across
the
country
with
a
collie
belonging
to
a
neighbouring
farmer
she
the
very
picture
of
sadness
poor
little
girl
you
seem
to
sympathise
with
her
krail
why
does
she
not
stand
between
us
and
fortune
she
stand
between
us
and
a
court
of
assize
if
that
woman
acts
the
fool
declared
the
shabby
stranger
who
moved
so
rapidly
and
whose
vigilance
seemed
unequalled
if
we
go
she
shall
go
also
flockart
declared
in
a
threatening
voice
but
you
must
prevent
such
a
krail
urged
ah
it
all
very
well
to
talk
like
that
but
you
know
enough
of
her
ladyship
to
be
aware
that
she
acts
on
her
own
initiative
that
shows
that
she
no
fool
remarked
the
foreigner
quickly
you
who
hold
her
in
the
hollow
of
your
hand
must
prevent
her
from
opening
up
to
her
husband
the
whole
future
lies
with
you
and
what
is
the
future
without
money
we
want
a
few
thousands
for
immediate
necessities
both
of
us
the
woman
allowance
from
her
husband
is
nowadays
a
mere
bagatelle
because
he
probably
knows
that
some
of
her
money
has
gone
into
your
pockets
my
dear
boy
no
he
completely
in
ignorance
of
that
how
indeed
could
he
know
she
takes
very
good
care
there
no
possibility
of
his
finding
out
well
remarked
the
stranger
that
what
i
fear
has
happened
or
may
one
day
happen
the
fact
is
we
are
in
a
quandary
at
the
present
moment
you
were
a
bit
too
confident
in
dealing
with
those
documents
you
found
at
glencardine
you
should
have
taken
her
ladyship
into
your
confidence
and
got
her
to
pump
her
husband
concerning
them
if
you
had
we
should
have
made
the
mess
of
it
that
we
have
done
i
must
admit
krail
that
what
you
say
is
true
declared
the
man
you
are
such
a
philosopher
always
i
asked
you
to
come
here
in
secret
to
explain
the
exact
position
it
is
one
of
peril
we
are
checkmated
goslin
holds
the
whole
position
in
his
hands
and
will
keep
it
very
fortunately
for
you
he
does
though
we
were
very
near
exposure
when
i
went
out
to
athens
and
made
a
fool
of
myself
upon
the
report
furnished
by
you
i
believed
it
to
be
a
genuine
one
i
had
no
idea
that
the
old
man
was
so
crafty
exactly
and
if
he
displayed
such
clever
ingenuity
and
forethought
in
laying
a
trap
for
the
inquisitive
is
it
not
more
than
likely
that
there
may
be
other
traps
baited
with
equal
craft
and
cunning
then
how
are
we
to
make
the
flockart
asked
looking
into
the
colourless
eyes
of
his
friend
we
shall
i
fear
never
make
it
unless
unless
what
he
asked
unless
the
old
man
meets
with
an
accident
replied
the
other
in
a
low
distinct
voice
men
sometimes
do
you
know
chapter
xxiii
which
shows
a
shabby
foreigner
felix
krail
his
cigarette
held
to
his
lips
stood
watching
the
effect
of
his
insinuation
he
saw
a
faint
smile
playing
about
lips
and
knew
that
it
appealed
to
him
old
sir
henry
heyburn
had
laid
a
clever
trap
for
him
a
trap
into
which
he
himself
believed
that
his
daughter
had
fallen
why
should
not
flockart
retaliate
the
shabby
stranger
whose
own
ingenuity
and
were
little
short
of
marvellous
and
under
whose
watchful
vigilance
the
heyburn
household
had
been
ever
since
her
ladyship
and
her
friend
flockart
had
gone
south
stood
silent
but
in
complete
satisfaction
the
the
man
so
well
known
at
all
the
various
gay
resorts
from
ventimiglia
along
to
cannes
and
who
was
a
member
of
the
f√™tes
committee
at
san
remo
and
at
nice
merely
exchanged
glances
with
his
friend
and
smiled
quickly
however
he
changed
the
topic
of
conversation
and
what
occurring
in
paris
ah
there
we
have
the
puzzle
replied
the
man
krail
his
accent
being
an
unfamiliar
one
so
unfamiliar
indeed
that
those
unacquainted
with
the
truth
were
always
placed
in
doubt
regarding
his
true
nationality
but
you
made
inquiry
asked
his
friend
quickly
of
course
but
the
business
is
kept
far
too
close
every
precaution
is
taken
to
prevent
anything
leaking
out
krail
responded
the
clerks
will
speak
wo
they
the
other
said
cher
they
know
no
more
of
the
business
of
the
mysterious
firm
of
which
the
blind
baronet
is
the
head
than
we
do
ourselves
said
krail
they
make
enormous
financial
deals
that
very
certain
not
deals
but
for
themselves
he
laughed
correcting
flockart
recollect
what
i
discovered
in
athens
and
the
extraordinary
connection
you
found
in
brussels
ah
yes
you
mean
that
clever
crowd
four
men
and
two
women
who
were
working
the
gambling
concession
from
the
dutch
government
exclaimed
flockart
yes
that
was
a
complete
mystery
they
sent
wires
in
cipher
to
sir
henry
at
glencardine
i
managed
to
get
a
glance
at
one
of
them
and
it
was
signed
that
their
paris
cable
address
said
his
companion
surely
you
with
your
network
of
sources
of
information
and
your
own
genius
for
discovering
secrets
ought
to
be
able
to
reveal
the
true
nature
of
sir
henry
business
is
it
an
honest
one
asked
flockart
i
think
not
think
why
my
dear
felix
this
is
like
you
only
to
think
you
always
you
so
certain
of
your
facts
that
i
always
banked
upon
them
the
other
gave
his
shoulders
a
shrug
of
indecision
it
was
not
a
judicious
move
on
your
part
to
get
rid
of
the
girl
from
glencardine
he
said
slowly
while
she
was
there
we
had
a
chance
of
getting
at
some
clue
but
now
old
goslin
has
taken
her
place
we
may
just
as
well
abandon
investigation
at
that
end
you
failed
krail
and
attribute
your
failure
to
me
protested
his
companion
how
could
i
risk
being
ignominiously
kicked
out
of
glencardine
as
a
spy
whatever
attitude
you
might
have
taken
would
have
had
the
same
result
we
used
the
information
and
found
ourselves
fooled
tricked
by
a
very
crafty
old
man
who
actually
prepared
those
documents
in
case
he
was
betrayed
admitted
said
flockart
but
even
though
we
made
fools
of
ourselves
in
athens
and
caused
the
greek
government
to
look
upon
us
as
rogues
and
liars
the
girl
is
suspected
and
i
for
one
do
mean
to
give
in
before
we
secured
a
nice
snug
little
sum
how
are
we
to
do
it
by
obtaining
knowledge
of
the
game
being
played
in
paris
and
working
in
an
opposite
direction
flockart
replied
we
are
agreed
upon
one
point
that
for
the
past
few
years
ever
since
goslin
came
on
the
scene
sir
henry
business
a
big
one
there
is
no
doubt
has
been
of
a
mysterious
and
therefore
shady
character
by
his
confidence
in
gabrielle
his
care
that
nobody
ever
got
a
chance
inside
that
safe
his
regular
consultations
with
goslin
who
travelled
from
paris
specially
to
see
him
his
constant
telegrams
in
cipher
and
his
refusal
to
allow
even
his
wife
to
obtain
the
slightest
inkling
into
his
private
affairs
it
is
shown
that
he
fears
exposure
do
you
agree
most
certainly
i
do
well
any
man
who
is
in
dread
of
the
truth
becoming
known
must
be
carrying
on
some
negotiations
the
reverse
of
creditable
he
is
the
moving
spirit
of
that
shady
house
without
a
doubt
declared
flockart
who
had
so
often
grasped
the
blind
man
hand
in
friendship
in
such
fear
that
his
transactions
should
become
known
and
that
exposure
might
result
he
actually
had
prepared
documents
on
purpose
to
mislead
those
who
pried
into
his
affairs
therefore
the
instant
we
discover
the
truth
fortune
will
be
at
our
hand
we
all
want
money
you
i
and
lady
heyburn
and
money
we
have
with
these
sentiments
my
dear
friend
i
entirely
and
absolutely
agree
remarked
the
shabby
man
lighting
a
fresh
cigarette
but
one
fact
you
seem
to
have
entirely
overlooked
what
the
girl
she
stands
between
you
and
she
might
come
back
into
the
old
man
favour
you
know
and
even
though
she
did
that
makes
no
difference
flockart
answered
defiantly
why
because
she
dare
not
say
a
single
word
against
me
krail
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
with
considerable
surprise
but
made
no
comment
she
knows
better
flockart
added
never
believe
too
much
in
your
own
power
with
a
woman
cher
remarked
the
other
dubiously
she
young
therefore
of
a
romantic
turn
of
mind
she
in
love
remember
which
makes
matters
much
worse
for
us
why
because
being
in
love
she
may
become
seized
with
a
sentimental
fit
this
ends
generally
in
a
determination
of
and
in
such
case
she
would
tell
the
truth
in
defiance
of
you
and
would
be
heedless
of
her
own
danger
flockart
drew
a
long
breath
what
this
man
said
was
he
knew
within
his
own
heart
only
too
true
of
the
girl
towards
whom
they
had
been
so
cruel
and
so
unscrupulous
his
had
been
a
lifelong
scheme
and
as
part
of
his
scheme
in
conjunction
with
the
woman
who
was
sir
henry
wife
it
had
been
unfortunately
compulsory
to
sacrifice
the
girl
who
was
the
blind
man
right
hand
yes
gabrielle
was
deeply
in
love
with
walter
murie
the
man
upon
whom
sir
henry
now
looked
as
his
enemy
and
who
would
have
exposed
him
to
the
greek
government
if
the
blind
man
had
not
been
too
clever
the
baronet
after
his
daughter
confession
naturally
attributed
her
curiosity
to
walter
initiative
the
more
especially
that
walter
had
been
in
paris
and
it
was
believed
in
athens
also
the
pair
were
however
now
separated
krail
in
pursuit
of
his
diligent
inquiries
had
actually
been
in
woodnewton
and
seen
the
lonely
little
figure
sad
and
dejected
taking
long
rambles
accompanied
only
by
a
farmer
young
murie
had
not
been
there
nor
did
the
pair
now
correspond
this
much
krail
had
himself
discovered
the
problem
placed
before
flockart
by
his
shabby
friend
was
a
somewhat
disconcerting
one
on
the
one
hand
lady
heyburn
had
urged
him
to
leave
the
riviera
without
giving
him
any
reason
and
on
the
other
he
had
the
danger
of
gabrielle
in
a
sudden
fit
of
sentimental
giving
him
away
if
she
did
what
then
the
mere
suggestion
caused
him
to
bite
his
nether
lip
krail
knew
a
good
deal
but
he
did
not
know
all
perhaps
it
was
as
well
that
he
did
not
there
is
a
code
of
honour
among
adventurers
all
the
world
over
but
few
of
them
can
resist
the
practice
of
blackmail
when
they
chance
to
fall
upon
evil
days
yes
flockart
said
reflectively
as
at
krail
suggestion
they
turned
and
began
to
descend
the
steep
hill
towards
ospedaletti
perhaps
it
a
pity
after
all
that
the
girl
left
glencardine
yet
surely
she
safer
with
her
aunt
she
was
driven
from
glencardine
by
her
father
you
sacrificed
her
in
order
to
save
yourself
that
was
but
natural
it
a
pity
however
you
did
take
my
advice
i
suggested
it
to
lady
heyburn
but
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
declared
that
such
a
course
was
far
too
dangerous
dangerous
echoed
the
shabby
man
surely
it
could
not
have
placed
either
of
you
in
any
greater
danger
than
you
are
in
already
she
did
like
it
few
people
do
laughed
the
other
but
depend
upon
it
it
the
only
way
she
would
at
any
rate
have
had
an
opportunity
of
telling
the
truth
flockart
pulled
a
wry
face
and
after
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
said
do
let
us
discuss
that
we
fully
considered
all
the
pros
and
cons
at
the
time
her
ladyship
is
growing
scrupulously
honest
of
late
sneered
his
companion
she
try
to
get
rid
of
you
very
soon
i
expect
the
latter
sentence
was
more
full
of
meaning
than
the
speaker
dreamed
the
words
falling
upon
flockart
ears
caused
him
to
wince
was
her
ladyship
really
trying
to
rid
herself
of
his
influence
he
laughed
within
himself
at
the
thought
of
her
endeavouring
to
release
herself
from
the
bond
for
her
he
had
never
at
any
moment
entertained
either
admiration
or
affection
their
association
had
always
been
purely
one
of
business
business
be
it
said
in
which
he
made
the
profits
and
she
the
losses
it
would
hardly
be
an
easy
matter
for
her
replied
the
audacious
adventurer
she
seems
to
be
very
popular
up
at
glencardine
remarked
the
foreigner
because
she
extravagant
and
spends
money
in
the
neighbourhood
i
suppose
but
the
people
in
auchterarder
village
criticise
her
treatment
of
gabrielle
they
hear
gossip
from
the
servants
i
expect
they
should
know
of
the
girl
treatment
of
her
stepmother
exclaimed
flockart
but
there
villagers
are
always
prone
to
listen
to
and
embroider
any
stories
concerning
the
private
life
of
the
gentry
just
the
same
in
scotland
as
in
any
other
country
in
the
world
ah
continued
flockart
in
scotland
the
old
families
are
gradually
decaying
and
their
estates
are
falling
into
the
hands
of
blatant
parvenus
stalk
deer
nowadays
and
city
clerks
on
their
holidays
shoot
over
peers
preserves
the
humble
scot
sees
it
all
with
regret
because
he
has
no
real
liking
for
this
invasion
by
the
english
from
lancashire
buy
and
from
limehouse
purchase
castles
with
family
portraits
and
ghosts
complete
ah
speaking
of
the
supernatural
exclaimed
krail
suddenly
do
you
know
i
had
a
most
extraordinary
and
weird
experience
when
at
glencardine
about
three
weeks
ago
i
actually
heard
the
whispers
flockart
stared
hard
at
the
man
at
his
side
and
laughing
outright
said
well
that
the
best
joke
i
heard
you
of
all
men
to
be
taken
in
by
a
mere
superstition
but
my
dear
friend
i
heard
them
said
krail
i
swear
i
actually
heard
them
and
i
well
i
admit
to
you
even
though
you
may
laugh
at
me
for
being
a
superstitious
fool
i
somehow
anticipate
that
something
uncanny
is
about
to
happen
to
me
you
going
to
die
like
all
the
rest
of
them
i
suppose
laughed
his
friend
as
they
descended
the
dusty
winding
road
that
led
to
the
promenade
of
the
quiet
little
mediterranean
chapter
xxiv
when
greek
meets
greek
on
their
left
were
several
white
villas
before
which
pink
and
scarlet
geraniums
ran
riot
with
spreading
mimosas
golden
with
their
feathery
blossom
for
ospedaletti
makes
a
frantic
if
vain
bid
for
popularity
as
a
its
deadly
dullness
however
is
too
well
known
to
the
habitu√©
of
the
riviera
and
its
casino
which
never
obtained
a
licence
imparts
to
it
the
air
of
painful
effort
at
gaiety
well
remarked
the
shabby
man
as
they
passed
along
and
out
upon
the
in
the
direction
of
bordighera
i
always
looked
upon
what
the
people
at
auchterarder
said
regarding
the
whispers
as
a
mere
myth
but
now
having
heard
them
with
my
own
ears
how
can
i
have
further
doubt
i
listened
in
the
castle
ruins
a
good
many
times
my
dear
krail
replied
the
other
but
i
never
heard
anything
more
exciting
than
an
owl
indeed
lady
heyburn
and
i
when
there
was
so
much
gossip
about
the
strange
noises
some
two
years
ago
set
to
work
to
investigate
we
went
there
at
least
a
dozen
times
but
without
result
only
both
of
us
caught
bad
colds
well
exclaimed
krail
i
used
to
ridicule
the
weird
stories
i
heard
in
the
village
about
the
devil
whisper
and
all
that
but
by
mere
chance
i
happened
to
be
at
the
spot
one
bright
night
and
i
heard
distinct
whisperings
just
as
had
been
described
to
me
they
gave
me
a
very
creepy
feeling
i
can
assure
you
bosh
now
do
you
believe
in
ghosts
you
that
you
are
my
dear
felix
no
most
decidedly
i
do
then
what
you
heard
is
only
in
imagination
depend
upon
it
the
supernatural
does
exist
in
glencardine
that
quite
certain
declared
flockart
the
fact
is
that
there
so
much
tradition
and
legendary
lore
connected
with
the
old
place
and
its
early
owners
were
such
a
set
of
bold
and
defiant
robbers
that
for
generations
the
peasantry
have
held
it
in
awe
hence
all
sorts
of
weird
and
terrible
stories
have
been
invented
and
handed
down
until
the
present
age
believes
them
to
be
based
upon
fact
but
my
dear
friend
i
actually
heard
the
whispers
heard
them
with
my
own
ears
krail
asserted
i
happened
to
be
about
the
place
that
night
trying
to
get
a
peep
into
the
library
where
goslin
and
the
old
man
were
i
believe
busy
at
work
but
the
blinds
fitted
too
closely
so
that
i
could
see
inside
the
keeper
and
his
men
were
i
knew
down
in
the
village
therefore
i
took
a
stroll
towards
the
ruins
and
as
it
was
a
beautiful
night
i
sat
down
in
the
courtyard
to
have
a
smoke
then
of
a
sudden
i
heard
low
voices
quite
distinctly
they
startled
me
for
not
until
they
fell
upon
my
ears
did
i
recall
the
stories
told
to
me
weeks
before
if
stewart
or
any
of
the
had
found
you
prowling
about
the
castle
grounds
at
that
hour
they
might
have
asked
you
awkward
questions
remarked
flockart
oh
laughed
the
other
they
all
know
me
as
a
visitor
to
the
village
fond
of
walking
exercise
i
took
very
good
care
that
they
should
all
know
me
so
that
as
few
explanations
as
possible
would
be
necessary
as
you
well
know
the
secret
of
all
my
successes
is
that
i
never
leave
anything
to
chance
to
go
peeping
about
outside
the
house
and
trying
to
took
in
at
lighted
windows
sounds
a
rather
injudicious
proceeding
his
companion
declared
not
if
proper
precautions
are
taken
as
i
took
them
i
was
weeks
in
that
terribly
dull
scotch
village
but
nobody
suspected
my
real
mission
i
made
quite
a
large
circle
of
friends
at
the
who
all
believed
me
to
be
a
foreign
ornithologist
writing
a
book
upon
the
birds
of
scotland
trust
me
to
tell
people
a
good
story
well
exclaimed
flockart
after
a
long
silence
those
whispers
are
certainly
a
mystery
more
especially
if
you
actually
heard
them
on
two
or
three
occasions
i
spoken
to
sir
henry
about
them
he
ridicules
the
idea
yet
he
admitted
to
me
one
evening
that
the
voices
had
really
been
heard
i
declared
that
the
most
remarkable
fact
was
the
sudden
death
of
each
person
who
had
listened
and
heard
them
it
is
a
curious
phenomenon
which
certainly
should
be
investigated
the
inference
is
that
i
having
listened
to
the
ghostly
voices
am
doomed
to
a
sudden
and
violent
end
remarked
the
shabby
stranger
quite
gloomily
flockart
laughed
really
felix
this
is
too
funny
he
said
fancy
your
taking
notice
of
such
old
wives
fables
why
my
dear
fellow
you
got
many
years
of
constant
activity
before
you
yet
you
must
return
to
paris
in
the
morning
and
watch
in
patience
i
have
watched
but
discovered
nothing
perhaps
i
come
and
assist
you
most
probably
i
shall
no
do
as
soon
as
you
leave
san
remo
sir
henry
will
know
and
he
might
suspect
suspect
what
that
you
are
in
search
of
the
truth
and
of
fortune
in
consequence
he
believes
in
me
only
the
other
day
i
had
a
letter
from
him
written
in
goslin
hand
repeating
the
confidence
he
reposes
in
me
exactly
you
must
remain
down
here
for
the
present
flockart
recollected
the
puzzling
decision
of
lady
heyburn
and
remained
silent
our
chief
peril
is
still
the
one
which
has
faced
us
all
along
went
on
the
man
in
the
grey
hat
the
peril
that
the
girl
may
tell
about
that
awkward
affair
at
chantilly
she
dare
not
flockart
assured
him
quickly
krail
shook
his
head
dubiously
she
leading
a
lonely
life
her
heart
is
broken
and
she
believes
herself
as
every
other
young
girl
does
to
be
without
a
future
therefore
she
brooding
over
it
one
never
knows
in
such
cases
when
a
girl
may
fling
all
prudence
to
the
winds
he
said
if
she
did
then
nothing
could
save
us
that
just
what
her
ladyship
said
the
other
day
answered
flockart
tossing
away
his
cigarette
but
you
do
know
that
i
hold
her
irrevocably
she
dare
not
say
a
single
word
if
she
dare
why
did
she
not
tell
the
truth
about
the
safe
probably
because
it
was
all
too
sudden
she
now
finds
life
in
that
dismal
little
village
intolerable
she
a
girl
of
spirit
you
know
and
has
always
been
used
to
luxury
and
freedom
to
live
with
an
old
woman
in
a
country
cottage
away
from
all
her
friends
must
be
maddening
no
my
dear
james
in
this
you
acted
most
injudiciously
you
were
devoid
of
your
usual
foresight
depend
upon
it
a
very
serious
danger
threatens
she
will
speak
i
tell
you
she
dare
not
rest
your
mind
assured
she
will
shall
not
how
pray
can
you
close
her
mouth
asked
the
foreigner
flockart
eyes
met
his
in
them
was
a
curious
expression
almost
a
glitter
krail
understood
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
uttered
no
word
his
gesture
was
however
that
of
one
unconvinced
adventurer
as
he
was
ingenious
and
unscrupulous
he
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
sometimes
he
made
a
big
and
placed
himself
in
funds
but
following
such
an
event
he
was
and
generous
to
his
friends
extravagant
in
his
expenditure
and
very
soon
found
himself
under
the
necessity
to
exercise
his
wits
in
order
to
obtain
the
next
louis
he
had
known
flockart
for
years
as
one
of
his
own
class
they
had
first
met
long
ago
on
board
a
castle
liner
homeward
bound
from
capetown
where
both
found
themselves
playing
a
crooked
game
a
friendship
begotten
of
dishonesty
had
sprung
up
between
them
and
in
consequence
they
had
thrown
in
their
lot
together
more
than
once
with
considerable
financial
advantage
the
present
affair
was
however
not
much
to
krail
liking
and
this
he
had
more
than
once
told
his
friend
it
was
quite
possible
that
if
they
could
discover
the
mysterious
source
of
this
blind
man
wealth
they
might
by
judiciously
levying
blackmail
through
a
third
party
secure
a
very
handsome
income
which
he
was
to
share
with
flockart
and
her
ladyship
the
krail
had
always
admitted
to
be
one
of
the
cleverest
women
he
had
ever
met
his
only
surprise
had
been
that
she
as
sir
henry
wife
was
unable
to
get
at
the
facts
which
were
so
cleverly
withheld
it
only
showed
however
that
the
baronet
though
deprived
of
eyesight
was
even
more
clever
than
the
unscrupulous
woman
he
had
so
foolishly
married
krail
held
lady
heyburn
in
distinct
distrust
he
had
once
had
dealings
with
her
which
had
turned
out
the
reverse
of
satisfactory
instinctively
he
knew
that
in
order
to
save
herself
if
exposure
ever
came
she
would
give
him
away
without
the
least
compunction
what
had
puzzled
him
for
several
years
and
what
indeed
had
puzzled
other
people
was
the
reason
of
the
close
friendship
between
flockart
and
the
baronet
wife
it
was
certainly
not
affection
he
knew
flockart
intimately
and
had
knowledge
of
his
private
affairs
therefore
he
was
well
aware
of
the
existence
of
an
unknown
and
rather
insignificant
woman
to
whom
he
was
in
secret
devoted
no
the
bond
between
the
pair
was
an
entirely
mysterious
one
he
knew
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
flockart
demands
for
money
had
been
a
little
too
frequent
she
had
resisted
and
attempted
to
withdraw
from
further
association
with
him
yet
by
a
single
word
or
even
a
look
he
could
compel
her
to
disgorge
the
funds
he
needed
for
she
had
even
handed
him
some
of
her
trinkets
to
pawn
until
she
could
obtain
further
funds
from
sir
henry
to
redeem
them
as
they
walked
together
along
the
white
corniche
road
their
faces
set
towards
the
gorgeous
southern
afterglow
while
the
waves
lapped
lazily
on
the
grey
rocks
all
these
puzzling
thoughts
recurred
to
krail
lady
heyburn
seems
still
to
remain
your
very
devoted
friend
he
remarked
at
last
with
a
meaning
smile
i
see
from
the
york
what
pleasant
parties
she
gives
and
how
she
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
social
merriment
in
san
remo
by
jove
james
you
a
lucky
man
to
possess
such
a
popular
hostess
as
friend
yes
laughed
flockart
winnie
is
a
regular
pal
without
her
i
should
have
been
broken
long
ago
but
she
always
ready
to
help
me
along
people
have
already
remarked
upon
your
remarkable
friendship
said
his
friend
and
many
allegations
have
been
made
oh
yes
i
quite
well
aware
of
that
my
dear
fellow
it
has
pained
me
more
than
enough
you
yourself
know
that
as
far
as
affection
goes
never
in
my
life
entertained
a
spark
of
it
for
winnie
we
were
children
together
and
have
been
friends
always
quite
so
exclaimed
krail
smiling
that
a
pretty
good
story
to
tell
the
world
but
there
a
point
where
mere
friendship
must
break
you
know
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
other
glancing
at
him
in
surprise
well
the
story
you
tell
other
people
may
be
picturesque
and
romantic
but
with
me
it
just
a
trifle
weak
lady
heyburn
does
give
her
pearls
to
be
pawned
out
of
mere
friendship
you
know
flockart
was
silent
he
knew
too
well
that
the
man
walking
at
his
side
was
as
clever
an
intriguer
and
as
bold
an
adventurer
as
had
ever
moved
up
and
down
europe
working
the
game
in
search
of
pigeons
to
pluck
his
shabbiness
was
assumed
he
had
alighted
at
bordighera
station
from
the
from
paris
spent
the
night
at
a
hotel
in
order
not
to
be
recognised
at
the
angst
or
any
of
the
smarter
houses
and
had
met
him
by
appointment
to
explain
the
present
situation
his
remarks
however
were
the
reverse
of
reassuring
what
did
he
suspect
i
do
quite
follow
you
krail
flockart
said
i
meant
to
imply
that
if
friendship
only
links
you
with
lady
heyburn
the
chain
may
quite
easily
snap
he
remarked
he
looked
at
his
friend
much
puzzled
he
could
see
no
point
in
that
observation
krail
read
what
was
passing
in
the
other
mind
and
added
i
know
cher
that
affection
from
her
ladyship
is
entirely
out
of
the
question
the
gossips
are
liars
and
sir
henry
himself
is
quite
aware
of
that
i
have
already
spoken
quite
plainly
and
openly
to
him
and
suggested
my
departure
from
glencardine
on
account
of
remarks
by
her
ladyship
enemies
but
he
would
not
hear
of
my
leaving
and
pressed
me
to
remain
krail
looked
at
him
in
blank
surprise
well
he
said
if
you
been
bold
enough
to
do
this
in
face
of
the
gossip
then
you
a
much
cleverer
man
than
ever
i
took
you
to
be
for
answer
flockart
took
some
letters
from
his
selected
one
written
in
a
foreign
hand
and
gave
it
to
krail
to
read
it
was
from
the
hermit
of
glencardine
written
at
his
dictation
by
monsieur
goslin
and
was
couched
in
the
warmest
and
most
confidential
terms
look
here
james
exclaimed
the
shabby
man
handing
back
the
letter
i
going
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
tell
me
if
i
speak
the
truth
or
if
i
lie
it
is
neither
affection
nor
friendship
which
links
your
life
with
that
woman
am
i
right
flockart
did
not
answer
for
some
moments
his
eyes
were
cast
upon
the
ground
yes
krail
he
admitted
at
last
when
the
question
had
been
put
to
him
a
second
time
yes
krail
you
speak
the
truth
it
is
neither
affection
nor
friendship

gabrielle
in
exile
midway
between
historic
fotheringhay
and
ancient
apethorpe
the
ancestral
seat
of
the
earls
of
westmorland
lay
the
long
straggling
and
rather
village
of
woodnewton
like
many
other
northamptonshire
villages
it
consisted
of
one
long
street
of
cottages
many
of
them
with
dormer
windows
peeping
from
beneath
the
brown
thatch
the
better
houses
of
stone
with
old
mullioned
windows
but
all
of
them
more
or
less
in
stages
of
decay
with
the
depreciation
in
agriculture
woodnewton
once
quite
a
prosperous
little
place
was
now
terribly
shabby
and
depressing
as
he
entered
the
village
the
first
object
that
met
the
eye
of
the
stranger
was
a
barn
with
the
roof
half
fallen
away
and
next
it
a
ruined
house
with
its
thatch
full
of
holes
the
paving
was
and
even
the
several
inns
bore
an
appearance
of
struggles
with
poverty
up
the
long
straight
dispiriting
street
stood
a
cottage
larger
and
than
the
rest
its
ugly
exterior
was
by
ivy
which
had
been
cut
away
from
the
windows
while
unlike
its
neighbours
its
roof
was
tiled
and
its
brown
door
newly
painted
and
highly
varnished
old
miss
heyburn
lived
there
and
had
lived
there
for
the
past
the
prim
and
somewhat
eccentric
old
lady
was
a
figure
to
all
on
that
twice
each
sunday
with
her
in
her
hand
and
her
spectacles
on
her
thin
nose
she
walked
to
church
while
she
was
one
of
the
principal
supporters
of
the
village
and
institutions
inaugurated
by
the
worthy
rector
essentially
an
ascetic
person
she
was
looked
upon
with
fear
by
all
the
villagers
her
manner
was
brusque
her
speech
sharp
and
her
criticism
of
neglectful
mothers
caustic
and
much
to
the
point
prim
always
in
black
bonnet
and
cape
of
years
gone
by
both
in
summer
and
winter
she
took
no
heed
of
the
vagaries
of
fashion
even
when
they
reached
woodnewton
so
tardily
the
common
report
was
that
when
a
girl
she
had
been
crossed
in
love
for
her
single
maidservant
she
always
trained
to
a
sober
and
loveless
life
like
her
own
and
as
soon
as
a
girl
cast
an
eye
upon
a
likely
swain
she
was
ignominiously
dismissed
that
the
spinster
possessed
means
was
undoubted
it
was
known
that
she
was
sister
of
sir
henry
heyburn
of
caistor
in
lincolnshire
and
on
account
of
her
social
standing
she
on
rare
occasions
was
bidden
to
the
omnium
gatherings
at
some
of
the
mansions
in
the
neighbourhood
she
seldom
accepted
but
when
she
did
it
was
only
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
and
to
criticise
the
household
of
two
the
old
lady
and
her
exemplary
maid
was
assuredly
a
dull
one
meals
were
taken
with
punctual
regularity
amid
a
cleanliness
that
was
almost
painful
the
tiny
with
its
row
of
including
a
pot
of
musk
was
hardly
ever
entered
not
a
speck
of
dust
was
allowed
anywhere
for
miss
emily
eye
was
sharp
and
woe
betide
the
maid
if
a
mere
suspicion
of
dirt
were
discovered
everything
was
kept
locked
up
one
maid
who
resigned
hurriedly
refusing
to
be
criticised
afterwards
declared
that
her
mistress
kept
the
paraffin
under
lock
and
key
and
into
this
uncomfortably
prim
and
proper
household
little
gabrielle
had
suddenly
been
introduced
her
heart
overburdened
by
grief
and
full
of
regret
at
being
compelled
to
part
from
the
father
she
so
fondly
loved
she
had
accepted
the
inevitable
fully
realising
the
dull
greyness
of
the
life
that
lay
before
her
surely
her
exile
there
was
a
cruel
and
crushing
one
the
house
seemed
so
tiny
and
so
suffocating
after
the
splendid
halls
and
huge
rooms
at
glencardine
while
her
constant
sarcasm
about
her
father
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
eight
years
was
particularly
galling
the
woman
treated
the
girl
as
a
wayward
child
sent
there
for
punishment
and
correction
she
showed
her
neither
kindness
nor
consideration
for
truth
to
tell
it
annoyed
her
to
think
that
her
brother
should
have
imposed
the
girl
upon
her
she
hated
to
be
bothered
with
the
girl
but
existing
upon
sir
henry
charity
as
she
really
did
though
none
knew
it
she
could
do
no
otherwise
than
accept
his
daughter
as
her
guest
days
weeks
months
had
passed
each
day
dragging
on
as
its
predecessor
a
wretched
hopeless
despairing
existence
to
a
girl
so
full
of
life
and
vitality
as
gabrielle
though
she
had
written
several
times
to
her
father
he
had
sent
her
no
reply
to
her
mother
at
san
remo
she
had
also
written
and
from
her
had
received
one
letter
cold
and
unresponsive
from
walter
murie
nothing
not
a
single
word
the
books
in
the
village
library
she
had
read
as
well
as
those
in
the
possession
of
her
aunt
she
had
tried
needlework
problems
of
patience
and
the
translation
of
a
few
chapters
of
an
italian
novel
into
english
in
order
to
occupy
her
time
but
those
hours
when
she
was
alone
in
her
little
upstairs
room
with
the
sloping
roof
passed
alas
so
very
slowly
upon
her
ever
oppressive
were
thoughts
of
that
bitter
past
at
one
staggering
blow
she
had
lost
all
that
had
made
her
young
life
worth
living
her
father
esteem
and
her
lover
love
she
was
innocent
entirely
innocent
of
the
terrible
allegations
against
her
and
yet
she
was
so
utterly
defenceless
often
she
sat
at
her
little
window
for
hours
watching
the
lethargy
of
village
life
in
the
street
below
that
rural
life
in
which
the
rector
and
the
schoolmaster
were
the
principal
figures
the
dullness
of
it
all
was
maddening
her
aunt
primness
her
snappishness
towards
the
trembling
maid
and
the
thousand
and
one
rules
of
her
daily
life
irritated
her
and
jarred
upon
her
nerves
so
in
order
to
kill
time
and
at
the
same
time
to
study
the
antiquities
of
the
neighbourhood
her
father
having
taught
her
so
much
deep
antiquarian
knowledge
it
had
been
her
habit
for
three
months
past
to
take
long
walks
for
many
miles
across
the
country
accompanied
by
the
black
collie
rover
belonging
to
a
young
farmer
who
lived
at
the
end
of
the
village
the
animal
had
one
day
attached
itself
to
her
while
she
was
taking
a
walk
on
the
apethorpe
road
and
now
by
her
feeding
him
daily
and
making
a
pet
of
him
the
girl
and
the
dog
had
become
inseparable
by
long
walks
and
short
she
had
in
three
months
been
able
to
inspect
most
of
the
antiquities
of
northamptonshire
much
of
the
history
of
the
county
was
intensely
interesting
the
connection
of
old
fotheringhay
with
the
mary
queen
of
scots
the
beauties
of
peterborough
cathedral
the
splendid
old
tudor
house
of
deene
the
home
of
the
earls
of
cardigan
the
legends
of
king
john
concerning
cliffe
the
gaunt
splendour
of
ruined
kirby
and
the
charm
of
apethorpe
all
these
and
many
others
had
great
attraction
for
her
she
read
them
up
in
books
she
ordered
from
london
and
then
visited
the
old
places
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
a
spectacled
antiquary
every
day
no
matter
what
the
weather
she
might
be
seen
in
her
thick
boots
burberry
and
tam
trudging
along
the
roads
or
across
the
fields
accompanied
by
the
faithful
collie
the
winter
had
been
a
comparatively
mild
one
with
excessive
rain
but
no
downpour
troubled
her
she
liked
the
rain
to
beat
into
her
face
for
the
dismal
monotonous
cheerlessness
of
the
brown
fields
bare
trees
and
muddy
roads
was
in
keeping
with
the
tragedy
of
her
own
young
life
she
knew
that
her
aunt
emily
disliked
her
the
covert
sneers
the
caustic
criticisms
and
the
attitude
of
the
old
lady
irritated
the
girl
beyond
measure
she
was
not
wanted
in
that
painfully
prim
cottage
and
had
been
made
to
understand
it
from
the
first
day
hence
it
was
that
she
spent
all
the
time
she
possibly
could
out
of
doors
alone
she
had
traversed
the
whole
county
seeking
permission
to
glance
at
the
interior
of
any
old
house
or
building
that
promised
archaeological
interest
and
by
that
means
making
some
curious
friendships
many
people
regarded
the
pretty
young
girl
who
made
a
study
of
old
churches
and
old
houses
as
somewhat
eccentric
local
antiquaries
however
stared
at
her
in
wonder
when
they
found
that
she
was
possessed
of
knowledge
far
more
profound
than
theirs
and
that
she
could
decipher
old
documents
and
read
latin
inscriptions
with
ease
she
made
few
friends
preferring
solitude
and
reflection
to
visiting
and
gossiping
hers
was
indeed
a
pathetic
little
figure
and
the
countryfolk
used
to
stare
at
her
in
surprise
and
sigh
as
she
passed
through
the
various
little
hamlets
and
villages
so
regularly
the
black
collie
bounding
before
her
quickly
she
had
become
known
as
miss
heyburn
niece
and
the
report
having
spread
that
she
was
a
bit
eccentric
poor
thing
people
soon
ceased
to
wonder
and
began
to
regard
that
pale
sad
face
with
sympathy
the
whole
was
wondering
why
such
a
pretty
young
lady
had
gone
to
live
in
the
deadly
dullness
of
woodnewton
and
what
was
the
cause
of
that
great
sorrow
written
upon
her
countenance
her
daily
burden
of
bitter
reflection
was
indeed
hard
to
bear
her
one
thought
as
she
walked
those
miles
of
lonely
rural
byways
so
bare
and
cheerless
was
of
walter
her
walter
the
man
who
she
knew
would
have
willingly
given
his
very
life
for
hers
she
had
met
her
just
punishment
and
was
now
endeavouring
to
bear
it
bravely
she
had
renounced
his
love
for
ever
one
afternoon
dark
and
rainy
in
the
gloom
of
early
march
she
was
sitting
at
the
and
rather
tuneless
piano
in
the
damp
unused
best
room
which
was
devoid
of
fire
for
economic
reasons
her
aunt
was
seated
in
the
window
busily
crocheting
while
she
with
her
white
fingers
running
across
the
keys
raised
her
sweet
contralto
voice
in
that
florentine
song
that
for
centuries
has
been
sung
by
the
populace
in
the
streets
of
the
city
by
the
arno
in
questa
notte
in
sogno
veduto
era
vestito
tutto
di
braccato
le
piume
sul
berretto
di
velluto
ed
una
spada
aveva
allato
e
poi
detto
con
un
bel
sorriso
io
no
non
posso
star
da
te
diviso
da
te
diviso
non
ci
posso
stare
e
torno
per
mai
pin
non
ti
lasciare
miss
heyburn
sighed
and
looked
up
from
her
work
ca
you
sing
something
in
english
gabrielle
it
would
be
much
better
she
remarked
in
a
snappy
tone
the
girl
mouth
hardened
slightly
at
the
corners
and
she
closed
the
piano
without
replying
i
do
mean
you
to
stop
exclaimed
the
ascetic
old
lady
i
only
think
that
girls
instead
of
learning
foreign
songs
should
be
able
to
sing
english
ones
properly
wo
you
sing
another
no
replied
the
girl
rising
the
rain
has
ceased
so
i
shall
go
for
my
walk
and
she
left
the
room
to
put
on
her
hat
and
mackintosh
passing
along
before
the
window
a
few
minutes
later
in
the
direction
of
king
cliffe
it
was
always
the
same
if
she
indulged
herself
in
singing
one
or
other
of
those
ancient
of
the
tuscan
peasants
her
aunt
always
scolded
nothing
she
did
was
right
for
the
simple
reason
that
she
was
an
unwelcome
visitor
she
was
alone
rover
was
conducting
sheep
to
stamford
market
as
was
his
duty
every
week
therefore
in
the
fading
daylight
she
went
along
immersed
in
her
own
sad
thoughts
her
walk
at
that
hour
was
entirely
aimless
she
had
only
gone
forth
because
of
the
irritation
she
felt
at
her
aunt
constant
complaints
so
entirely
engrossed
was
she
by
her
own
despair
that
she
had
not
noticed
the
figure
of
a
man
who
catching
sight
of
her
at
the
end
of
woodnewton
village
had
held
back
until
she
had
gone
a
considerable
distance
and
had
then
sauntered
leisurely
in
the
direction
she
had
taken
the
man
kept
her
in
view
but
did
not
approach
her
the
high
red
passed
and
the
driver
touched
his
hat
respectfully
to
her
the
man
who
collected
the
evening
mail
from
all
the
villages
between
deene
and
peterborough
met
her
almost
every
evening
and
had
long
ago
inquired
and
learnt
who
she
was
for
nearly
two
miles
she
walked
onward
until
close
by
the
junction
of
the
road
which
comes
down
the
hill
from
nassington
the
man
who
had
been
following
hastened
up
and
overtook
her
she
heard
herself
addressed
by
name
and
turning
quickly
found
herself
face
to
face
with
james
flockart
chapter
xxvi
the
velvet
paw
the
stood
before
gabrielle
hat
in
hand
smiling
pleasantly
and
uttering
a
greeting
of
surprise
her
response
was
cold
for
was
not
all
her
present
unhappiness
due
to
him
i
come
here
to
speak
to
you
gabrielle
to
speak
to
you
in
confidence
whatever
you
have
to
say
may
surely
be
said
in
the
hearing
of
a
third
person
was
her
dignified
answer
his
sudden
appearance
had
startled
her
but
only
for
a
moment
she
was
cool
again
next
instant
and
on
her
guard
against
her
enemy
i
hardly
think
he
said
with
a
meaning
smile
that
you
would
really
like
me
to
speak
before
a
third
party
i
really
care
nothing
was
her
answer
and
i
can
not
see
why
you
seek
me
here
when
one
is
hopeless
as
i
am
one
becomes
callous
of
what
the
future
may
bring
hopeless
yes
he
said
in
a
changed
voice
i
know
that
living
in
this
dismal
hole
gabrielle
you
must
be
hopeless
i
know
that
your
exile
here
away
from
all
your
friends
and
those
you
love
must
be
do
think
that
i
have
not
reflected
upon
it
a
hundred
times
ah
then
you
have
at
last
experienced
remorse
she
cried
bitterly
looking
straight
into
the
man
face
you
have
estranged
me
from
my
father
and
tried
to
ruin
him
you
lied
to
him
lied
in
order
to
save
yourself
the
man
laughed
my
dear
child
he
exclaimed
you
really
misjudge
me
entirely
i
am
here
for
two
reasons
to
ask
your
forgiveness
for
making
that
allegation
which
was
imperative
and
secondly
to
assure
you
that
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
yet
be
your
friend
friend
she
echoed
in
a
hollow
voice
you
my
friend
yes
i
know
that
you
mistrust
me
he
replied
but
i
want
to
prove
that
my
intentions
towards
you
are
those
of
real
friendship
and
you
who
ever
since
my
girlhood
days
have
been
my
worst
enemy
ask
me
now
to
trust
you
she
exclaimed
with
indignation
no
go
back
to
lady
heyburn
and
tell
her
that
i
refuse
to
accept
the
which
you
and
she
hold
out
to
me
my
dear
girl
you
do
follow
me
he
exclaimed
impatiently
this
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
lady
heyburn
i
have
come
to
you
from
purely
personal
motives
my
sole
desire
is
to
effect
your
return
to
glencardine
for
your
own
ends
flockart
without
a
doubt
she
said
bitterly
ah
there
you
are
quite
mistaken
though
you
assert
that
i
am
your
father
enemy
i
am
i
tell
you
his
friend
he
is
ever
thinking
of
you
with
regret
you
were
his
right
hand
would
it
not
be
far
better
if
he
invited
you
to
return
she
sighed
at
the
thought
of
the
blind
man
whom
she
regarded
with
such
entire
devotion
but
answered
no
i
shall
never
return
to
glencardine
why
he
asked
was
it
anything
more
than
natural
that
believing
you
had
been
prying
into
his
affairs
your
father
in
a
moment
of
anger
condemned
you
to
this
life
of
appalling
monotony
no
not
more
natural
than
that
you
the
culprit
should
have
made
me
the
scapegoat
for
the
second
time
was
her
defiant
reply
have
i
not
already
told
you
that
the
reason
i
here
is
to
crave
your
forgiveness
i
admit
that
my
actions
have
been
the
reverse
of
honourable
but
well
there
were
circumstances
which
compelled
me
to
act
as
i
did
you
got
an
impression
of
my
father
had
a
duplicate
made
in
glasgow
as
i
have
found
out
and
one
night
opened
the
safe
and
copied
certain
private
documents
having
regard
to
a
proposed
loan
to
the
greek
government
the
night
i
discovered
you
was
the
second
occasion
when
you
went
to
the
library
and
opened
the
safe
do
you
deny
that
what
you
allege
gabrielle
is
perfectly
correct
he
replied
i
know
that
i
was
a
blackguard
to
shield
myself
behind
you
to
tell
the
lie
i
did
that
night
but
how
could
i
avoid
it
suppose
i
had
in
retaliation
spoken
the
truth
she
asked
looking
the
man
straight
in
the
face
ah
i
knew
that
you
would
not
do
that
you
believe
that
i
dare
not
dare
not
for
my
own
sake
eh
he
nodded
in
the
affirmative
then
you
are
much
mistaken
flockart
she
said
in
a
hard
voice
you
do
understand
that
a
woman
may
become
desperate
i
can
understand
how
desperate
you
have
become
living
in
this
hollow
a
week
of
it
would
i
admit
drive
me
to
distraction
then
if
you
understand
my
present
position
you
will
know
that
i
am
fearless
of
you
or
of
anybody
else
my
life
has
ended
i
have
neither
happiness
comfort
peace
of
mind
nor
love
all
is
of
the
past
to
you
you
james
flockart
i
am
indebted
for
all
this
you
have
held
me
powerless
i
was
a
happy
girl
once
but
you
and
your
dastardly
friends
crossed
my
path
like
an
evil
shadow
and
i
have
existed
in
an
inferno
of
remorse
ever
since
i
remorse
how
absurdly
you
talk
it
will
not
be
absurd
when
i
speak
the
truth
and
tell
the
world
what
i
know
it
will
be
rather
a
serious
matter
for
you
mr
flockart
you
threaten
me
then
he
asked
his
eyes
flashing
for
a
second
i
think
it
is
as
well
for
us
to
understand
one
another
at
once
she
said
frankly
they
had
halted
upon
a
small
bridge
close
to
the
entrance
to
apethorpe
village
then
i
to
understand
that
you
refuse
my
proffered
assistance
he
asked
i
require
no
assistance
from
my
enemies
was
her
defiant
and
dignified
reply
i
suppose
lady
heyburn
is
at
the
villa
at
san
remo
as
usual
and
that
it
was
she
who
sent
you
to
me
because
she
recognises
that
both
gone
a
little
too
far
you
have
when
the
opportunity
arises
then
i
shall
speak
regardless
of
the
consequences
therefore
flockart
i
wish
you
and
she
turned
away
no
gabrielle
he
cried
resolutely
barring
her
path
you
must
hear
me
you
do
grasp
the
point
of
my
argument
with
me
none
of
your
arguments
are
of
any
avail
was
her
response
in
a
bitter
tone
i
alas
have
reason
to
know
you
too
well
for
you
by
your
clever
intrigue
i
committed
a
crime
but
god
knows
i
am
innocent
of
what
was
intended
now
that
you
have
estranged
me
from
my
father
and
my
lover
i
shall
confess
confess
all
before
i
make
an
end
of
my
life
he
saw
from
her
pale
drawn
face
that
she
was
desperate
he
grew
afraid
but
my
dear
girl
think
of
what
you
are
saying
you
do
mean
it
you
ca
mean
it
your
father
has
relented
and
will
welcome
you
back
if
only
you
will
consent
to
return
i
have
no
wish
to
be
regarded
as
the
prodigal
daughter
was
her
proud
response
not
for
walter
murie
sake
asked
the
crafty
man
i
have
seen
him
i
was
at
the
club
with
him
last
night
and
we
had
a
chat
about
you
he
loves
you
very
dearly
ah
you
do
not
know
how
he
is
suffering
she
was
silent
and
he
recognised
in
an
instant
that
his
words
had
touched
the
sympathetic
chord
in
her
heart
he
is
not
suffering
any
greater
grief
than
i
am
she
said
in
a
low
mechanical
voice
her
brow
heavily
clouded
of
course
i
can
quite
understand
that
he
remarked
sympathetically
walter
is
a
good
fellow
and
well
it
is
indeed
sad
that
matters
should
be
as
they
are
he
is
entirely
devoted
to
you
gabrielle
not
more
so
than
i
am
to
him
declared
the
girl
quite
frankly
then
why
did
you
write
breaking
off
your
engagement
he
told
you
that
she
exclaimed
in
surprise
the
truth
was
that
murie
had
told
flockart
nothing
he
had
not
even
seen
him
it
was
only
a
wild
guess
on
flockart
part
tell
me
she
urged
anxiously
what
did
he
say
concerning
myself
flockart
hesitated
his
mind
was
instantly
active
in
the
concoction
of
a
story
oh
well
he
expressed
the
most
profound
regret
for
all
that
had
occurred
at
glencardine
and
is
of
course
utterly
puzzled
it
appears
that
just
before
christmas
he
went
home
to
connachan
and
visited
your
father
several
times
from
him
i
suppose
he
heard
how
you
had
been
discovered
you
told
him
nothing
i
told
him
nothing
declared
flockart
which
was
a
fact
did
he
express
a
wish
to
see
me
she
inquired
of
course
he
did
is
he
not
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
you
he
believes
you
have
treated
him
cruelly
i
i
know
i
have
flockart
she
admitted
but
i
acted
as
any
girl
of
honour
would
have
done
i
was
compelled
to
take
upon
myself
a
great
disgrace
and
on
doing
so
i
released
him
from
his
promise
to
me
most
honourable
the
man
declared
with
a
pretence
of
admiration
yet
underlying
it
all
was
a
craftiness
that
surely
was
unsurpassed
that
visit
of
his
to
northamptonshire
was
made
with
some
ulterior
motive
yet
what
it
was
the
girl
was
unable
to
discover
she
would
surely
have
been
cleverer
than
most
people
had
she
been
able
to
discern
the
hidden
sinister
motives
of
james
flockart
the
truth
was
that
he
had
not
seen
murie
and
the
story
of
his
anxiety
he
had
only
concocted
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
walter
asked
me
to
give
you
a
message
he
went
on
he
asked
me
to
urge
you
to
return
to
glencardine
and
to
withdraw
that
letter
you
wrote
him
before
your
departure
to
return
to
glencardine
she
repeated
staring
into
his
face
walter
wishes
me
to
do
that
why
because
he
loves
you
because
he
will
intercede
with
your
father
on
your
behalf
my
father
will
hear
nothing
in
my
favour
until
and
she
paused
until
what
until
i
tell
him
the
whole
truth
that
you
will
never
do
remarked
flockart
quickly
ah
there
you
mistaken
she
responded
in
all
probability
i
shall
then
before
you
do
so
pray
weigh
carefully
the
dire
results
he
urged
in
a
changed
tone
oh
i
already
done
that
long
ago
she
said
i
know
that
i
am
in
your
hands
utterly
and
irretrievably
flockart
and
the
only
way
i
can
regain
my
freedom
is
by
boldly
telling
the
truth
you
must
never
do
that
by
heaven
you
shall
not
he
cried
looking
fiercely
into
her
clear
eyes
i
know
i
quite
well
aware
of
your
attitude
towards
me
the
claws
can
not
be
entirely
concealed
in
the
cat
paw
you
know
and
she
laughed
bitterly
into
his
face
the
corners
of
the
man
mouth
hardened
he
was
about
to
speak
and
show
himself
in
his
true
colours
but
by
dint
of
great
he
managed
to
smile
and
exclaim
then
you
will
take
no
heed
of
these
wishes
of
the
man
who
loves
you
so
dearly
of
the
man
who
is
still
your
best
and
most
devoted
friend
you
prefer
to
remain
here
and
wear
out
your
young
life
with
vain
regrets
and
shattered
affections
come
gabrielle
do
be
sensible
the
girl
did
not
speak
for
several
moments
does
walter
really
wish
me
to
return
she
asked
looking
straight
at
him
as
though
trying
to
discern
whether
he
was
really
speaking
the
truth
yes
he
expressed
to
me
a
strong
wish
that
you
should
either
return
to
glencardine
or
go
and
live
at
park
street
he
wishes
to
see
me
of
course
it
would
perhaps
be
better
if
you
met
him
first
either
down
here
or
in
london
why
should
you
two
not
be
happy
he
went
on
i
know
it
is
my
fault
you
are
consigned
to
this
dismal
life
and
that
you
and
walter
are
parted
but
believe
me
gabrielle
i
am
at
this
moment
endeavouring
to
bring
you
together
again
and
to
reinstate
you
in
sir
henry
good
graces
he
is
longing
for
you
to
return
when
i
saw
him
last
at
glencardine
he
told
me
that
monsieur
goslin
was
not
so
clever
at
typing
or
in
grasping
his
meaning
as
you
are
and
he
is
only
awaiting
your
return
that
may
be
so
answered
the
girl
in
a
slow
distinct
voice
but
perhaps
you
tell
me
flockart
the
reason
you
evinced
such
an
unwonted
curiosity
in
my
father
affairs
my
dear
girl
laughed
the
man
surely
that
is
a
fair
question
i
had
certain
reasons
of
my
own
yes
assisted
by
lady
heyburn
you
thought
that
you
could
make
money
by
obtaining
knowledge
of
my
father
secrets
oh
yes
i
know
i
know
more
than
you
have
ever
imagined
declared
the
girl
boldly
you
hope
to
get
rid
of
monsieur
goslin
from
glencardine
and
reinstate
me
for
your
own
ends
i
see
it
all
the
man
bit
his
lip
with
chagrin
he
recognised
that
he
had
blundered
and
that
she
shrewd
and
clever
had
taken
advantage
of
his
error
he
was
however
too
clever
to
exhibit
his
annoyance
you
are
quite
wrong
in
your
surmise
gabrielle
he
said
quickly
walter
murie
loves
you
and
loves
you
well
therefore
with
regret
at
my
compulsory
denunciation
of
yourself
i
am
now
endeavouring
to
assist
you
thank
you
she
responded
coldly
again
turning
away
abruptly
i
require
no
assistance
from
a
man
such
as
yourself
a
man
who
entrapped
me
and
who
denounced
me
in
order
to
save
himself
you
will
regret
these
words
he
declared
as
she
walked
away
in
the
direction
of
woodnewton
she
turned
upon
him
in
fierce
anger
retorting
and
perhaps
you
on
your
part
will
regret
your
endeavour
to
entrap
me
a
second
time
i
have
promised
to
speak
the
truth
and
i
shall
keep
my
promise
i
am
not
afraid
to
sacrifice
my
own
life
to
save
my
father
honour
the
man
stood
staring
after
her
these
words
of
hers
held
him
motionless
what
if
she
flung
her
good
name
to
the
winds
and
actually
carried
out
her
threat
what
if
she
really
spoke
the
truth
ay
what
then
chapter
xxvii
betrays
the
bond
the
girl
hurried
on
her
heart
filled
with
wonder
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
of
indignation
the
one
thought
occupying
her
whole
mind
was
whether
walter
really
wished
to
see
her
again
had
flockart
spoken
the
truth
the
serious
face
of
the
man
she
loved
so
well
rose
before
her
blurred
vision
she
had
been
his
his
very
own
until
she
had
sent
off
that
fateful
letter
in
five
minutes
flockart
had
again
overtaken
her
his
attitude
was
appealing
he
urged
her
to
at
least
see
her
lover
again
even
if
she
refused
to
write
or
return
to
her
father
why
do
you
come
here
to
taunt
me
like
this
she
cried
turning
upon
him
angrily
once
because
you
were
my
mother
friend
i
believed
in
you
but
you
deceived
me
and
in
consequence
you
hold
me
in
your
power
were
it
not
for
that
i
could
have
spoken
to
my
father
have
told
him
the
truth
and
cleared
myself
he
now
believes
that
i
have
betrayed
his
business
secrets
while
at
the
same
time
he
considers
you
to
be
his
friend
i
am
his
friend
gabrielle
the
man
declared
why
tell
me
such
a
lie
she
asked
reproachfully
do
you
think
i
too
am
blind
certainly
not
i
give
you
credit
for
being
quite
as
clever
and
as
intelligent
as
you
are
dainty
and
charming
i
thank
you
she
cried
in
indignation
i
require
no
compliments
from
you
lady
heyburn
has
expressed
a
wish
to
see
you
he
said
she
is
still
in
san
remo
and
asked
me
to
invite
you
to
go
down
there
for
a
few
weeks
your
aunt
has
written
her
i
think
complaining
that
you
are
not
very
comfortable
at
woodnewton
i
have
not
complained
why
should
aunt
emily
complain
of
me
you
seem
to
be
the
bearer
of
messages
from
the
whole
of
my
family
mr
flockart
i
am
here
entirely
in
your
own
interests
my
dear
child
he
declared
with
that
patronising
air
which
so
irritated
her
not
entirely
i
think
she
said
smiling
bitterly
i
tell
you
i
much
regret
all
that
has
happened
and
you
regret
she
cried
fiercely
do
you
regret
the
end
of
that
woman
you
know
whom
i
mean
beneath
her
straight
glance
he
quivered
she
had
referred
to
a
subject
which
he
fain
would
have
buried
for
ever
this
dainty
girl
knew
a
terrible
secret
was
it
not
only
too
true
as
lady
heyburn
had
vaguely
suggested
a
dozen
times
that
her
mouth
ought
to
be
effectually
sealed
he
had
sealed
it
once
as
he
thought
her
fear
to
explain
to
her
father
the
incident
of
the
opening
of
the
safe
had
given
him
confidence
that
no
word
of
the
truth
regarding
the
past
would
ever
pass
her
lips
yet
he
saw
that
his
own
machinations
were
now
likely
to
prove
his
undoing
the
web
which
with
her
ladyship
assistance
he
had
woven
about
her
was
now
stretched
to
if
it
did
yield
then
the
result
must
be
ruin
and
worse
therefore
he
was
straining
every
effort
to
again
reinstate
her
in
her
father
good
graces
and
restore
in
her
mind
something
akin
to
confidence
but
all
his
arguments
as
he
walked
on
at
her
side
in
the
gathering
gloom
proved
useless
she
was
in
no
mood
to
listen
to
the
man
who
had
been
her
evil
genius
ever
since
her
as
he
was
speaking
she
was
wondering
if
she
dared
go
to
walter
murie
and
tell
him
everything
what
would
her
lover
think
of
her
what
indeed
he
would
only
cast
her
aside
as
worthless
no
far
better
that
he
should
remain
in
ignorance
and
retain
only
sad
memories
of
their
brief
happiness
i
am
going
to
glencardine
flockart
went
on
i
shall
join
the
mail
at
peterborough
what
shall
i
tell
your
father
tell
him
the
truth
was
her
reply
that
i
know
you
will
not
do
so
why
need
we
waste
further
words
do
you
actually
refuse
then
to
leave
this
dismal
hole
he
demanded
impatiently
yes
until
i
speak
and
tell
my
father
the
plain
and
ghastly
story
rubbish
he
ejaculated
you
never
do
that
unless
you
wish
to
stand
beside
me
in
a
criminal
dock
well
rather
that
than
be
your
longer
mr
flockart
she
cried
her
face
flushing
with
indignation
oh
oh
he
laughed
still
quite
imperturbed
come
come
this
is
scarcely
a
wise
reply
my
dear
little
girl
i
wish
you
to
leave
me
you
have
insulted
my
intelligence
enough
this
evening
surely
you
who
only
a
moment
ago
declared
yourself
my
friend
slowly
he
selected
a
cigarette
from
his
gold
case
and
halting
lit
it
well
if
you
meet
my
efforts
on
your
behalf
with
open
antagonism
like
this
i
ca
make
any
further
suggestion
no
please
do
go
up
to
glencardine
and
do
your
worst
for
me
i
am
now
fully
able
to
take
care
of
myself
she
exclaimed
in
defiance
you
can
also
write
to
lady
heyburn
and
tell
her
that
i
am
still
and
that
i
always
will
remain
my
blind
father
friend
but
why
do
you
listen
to
reason
gabrielle
he
implored
her
i
do
now
seek
to
lessen
or
deny
the
wrongs
i
have
done
you
in
the
past
nor
do
i
attempt
to
conceal
from
you
my
own
position
my
only
object
is
to
bring
you
and
walter
together
again
her
ladyship
knows
the
whole
circumstances
and
deeply
regrets
them
her
regret
will
be
the
more
poignant
some
day
i
assure
you
then
you
really
intend
to
act
vindictively
i
shall
act
just
as
i
think
proper
she
exclaimed
halting
a
moment
and
facing
him
please
understand
that
though
i
have
been
forced
in
the
past
to
act
as
you
have
indicated
because
i
feared
you
because
i
had
my
reputation
and
my
father
honour
at
stake
i
hold
you
in
terror
no
longer
mr
flockart
well
i
glad
you
told
me
that
he
said
laughing
as
though
he
treated
her
declaration
with
humour
it
just
as
well
perhaps
that
we
should
now
thoroughly
understand
each
other
yet
if
i
were
you
i
would
do
anything
rash
by
telling
the
truth
you
be
the
only
sufferer
you
know
the
only
sufferer
why
well
you
do
imagine
i
should
be
such
a
fool
as
to
admit
that
what
you
said
was
true
do
you
she
looked
at
him
in
surprise
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
he
with
his
innate
unscrupulousness
and
cunning
might
deny
her
allegations
and
might
even
be
able
to
prove
them
false
the
truth
could
not
be
denied
she
said
simply
recollect
the
cutting
from
the
edinburgh
paper
truth
is
denied
every
day
in
courts
of
law
he
retorted
no
before
you
act
foolishly
remember
that
put
to
the
test
your
word
would
stand
alone
against
mine
and
those
of
other
people
why
the
very
story
you
would
tell
would
be
so
utterly
amazing
and
startling
that
the
world
would
declare
you
had
invented
it
reflect
upon
it
for
a
moment
and
you
find
my
dear
girl
that
silence
is
golden
in
this
as
in
any
other
circumstance
in
life
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
and
met
his
gaze
firmly
so
you
defy
me
to
speak
she
cried
you
think
that
i
will
still
remain
in
this
accursed
bondage
of
yours
i
utter
no
threats
my
dear
child
replied
flockart
i
have
never
in
my
life
threatened
you
i
merely
venture
to
point
out
certain
difficulties
which
you
might
have
in
substantiating
any
allegation
which
you
might
make
against
me
for
that
reason
if
for
none
other
is
it
not
better
for
us
to
be
friends
i
am
not
the
friend
of
my
father
enemy
she
declared
you
are
quite
heroic
he
declared
with
a
covert
sneer
if
you
really
are
bent
upon
providing
the
halfpenny
newspapers
with
a
fresh
sensation
pray
let
me
know
in
plenty
of
time
wo
you
i
had
sufficient
of
your
taunts
cried
the
girl
bursting
into
a
flood
of
hot
tears
leave
me
i
i
say
no
further
word
to
you
except
to
forgive
me
he
added
why
should
i
she
asked
through
her
tears
because
for
your
own
sake
for
the
sake
of
your
future
it
will
surely
be
best
he
pointed
out
you
no
doubt
in
ignorance
of
legal
procedure
believed
that
what
you
alleged
would
be
accepted
in
a
court
of
justice
but
reflect
fully
before
you
again
threaten
me
dry
your
eyes
or
your
aunt
may
suspect
something
wrong
she
did
not
reply
what
he
said
impressed
her
and
he
did
not
fail
to
recognise
that
fact
he
smiled
within
himself
when
he
saw
that
he
had
triumphed
yet
he
had
not
gained
his
point
she
had
dashed
away
her
tears
with
the
little
wisp
of
lace
annoyed
with
herself
at
betraying
her
indignation
in
that
womanly
way
she
knew
him
alas
too
well
she
mistrusted
him
for
she
was
well
aware
of
how
cleverly
he
had
once
conspired
with
lady
heyburn
and
with
what
ingenuity
she
herself
had
been
drawn
into
the
disgraceful
and
amazing
affair
true
it
was
that
her
story
if
told
in
a
criminal
court
would
prove
so
extraordinary
that
it
would
not
be
believed
true
also
that
he
would
of
course
deny
it
and
that
his
denial
would
be
borne
out
by
the
woman
who
though
her
father
wife
was
his
worst
enemy
the
man
placed
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
saying
may
we
not
be
friends
gabrielle
she
shook
him
off
roughly
responding
in
the
negative
but
we
are
not
enemies
i
mean
we
will
not
be
enemies
as
we
have
been
shall
we
he
urged
to
this
she
made
no
reply
she
only
quickened
her
pace
for
the
twilight
was
fast
deepening
and
she
wished
to
be
back
again
at
her
aunt
house
why
had
that
man
followed
her
why
indeed
had
he
troubled
to
come
there
she
could
not
discern
his
motive
they
walked
together
in
silence
he
was
watching
her
face
reading
it
like
a
book
then
when
they
neared
the
first
thatched
cottage
at
the
entrance
to
the
village
he
halted
asking
may
we
not
now
become
friends
gabrielle
will
you
not
listen
and
take
my
advice
or
will
you
still
remain
buried
here
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
flockart
than
what
i
have
already
said
was
her
defiant
response
i
shall
act
as
i
think
best
and
you
will
dare
to
speak
and
place
yourself
in
a
ridiculous
position
you
mean
i
shall
use
my
own
judgment
in
defending
my
father
from
his
enemies
was
her
cold
response
as
with
a
slight
shrug
of
her
shoulders
she
turned
and
left
him
hurrying
forward
in
the
darkening
twilight
along
the
village
street
to
her
aunt
home
he
on
his
part
turned
upon
his
heel
with
a
muttered
remark
and
set
out
again
to
walk
towards
nassington
station
whence
after
nearly
an
wait
in
the
village
inn
he
took
train
to
peterborough
the
girl
had
once
again
defied
him
chapter
xxviii
the
whispers
again
was
it
really
true
what
flockart
had
told
her
did
walter
actually
wish
to
see
her
again
at
one
moment
she
believed
in
her
lover
strong
passionate
devotion
to
her
for
had
she
not
seen
it
displayed
in
a
hundred
different
ways
but
the
next
she
recollected
how
that
man
flockart
had
taken
advantage
of
her
youth
and
inexperience
in
the
past
how
he
had
often
lied
so
circumstantially
that
she
had
believed
his
words
to
be
the
truth
once
indeed
he
had
openly
declared
to
her
that
one
of
his
maxims
was
never
to
tell
the
truth
unless
obliged
after
dinner
a
simple
meal
served
in
the
poky
little
she
made
an
excuse
to
go
to
her
room
and
there
sat
for
a
long
time
deeply
reflecting
should
she
write
to
walter
would
it
be
judicious
to
explain
flockart
visit
and
how
he
had
urged
their
reconciliation
if
she
wrote
would
it
lower
her
dignity
in
her
lover
eyes
that
was
the
great
problem
which
now
troubled
her
she
sat
staring
before
her
undecided
she
recalled
all
that
flockart
had
told
her
he
was
the
emissary
of
lady
heyburn
without
a
doubt
the
girl
had
told
him
openly
of
her
decision
to
speak
the
truth
and
expose
him
but
he
had
only
laughed
at
her
alas
she
knew
his
true
character
unscrupulous
and
pitiless
but
she
placed
him
aside
recollection
of
walter
the
man
who
had
held
her
so
often
in
his
arms
and
pressed
his
hot
lips
to
hers
the
man
who
was
her
father
firm
friend
and
whose
uprightness
and
honesty
of
purpose
she
had
ever
admired
crowded
upon
her
should
she
write
to
him
rigid
and
staring
she
sat
in
her
chair
her
little
white
hands
clenched
as
she
tried
to
summon
courage
it
had
been
she
who
had
written
declaring
that
their
secret
engagement
must
be
broken
she
who
had
condemned
herself
therefore
had
she
not
a
right
to
satisfy
that
longing
she
had
had
through
months
the
longing
to
write
to
him
once
again
the
thought
decided
her
and
going
to
the
table
whereon
the
lamp
was
burning
she
sat
down
and
after
some
reflection
penned
a
letter
as
follows
my
sweetheart
my
darling
my
own
my
soul
mine
only
mine
i
am
wondering
how
and
where
you
are
true
i
wrote
you
a
cruel
letter
but
it
was
imperative
and
under
the
force
of
circumstance
i
am
full
of
regrets
and
i
only
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
i
might
kiss
you
once
again
and
press
you
in
my
arms
as
i
used
to
do
but
how
are
you
i
have
had
you
before
my
eyes
and
i
feel
quite
sure
that
at
this
very
moment
you
are
thinking
of
me
you
must
know
that
i
love
you
dearly
you
gave
me
your
heart
and
it
shall
not
belong
to
any
other
i
have
tried
to
be
brave
and
courageous
but
alas
i
have
failed
i
love
you
my
darling
and
i
must
see
you
soon
very
soon
flockart
came
to
see
me
and
says
that
you
expressed
to
him
a
desire
to
meet
me
again
gratify
that
desire
when
you
will
and
you
will
find
your
gabrielle
just
the
same
longing
ever
to
see
you
living
with
only
the
memories
of
your
dear
face
can
you
doubt
of
my
great
great
love
for
you
you
never
wrote
in
reply
to
my
letter
though
i
have
waited
for
months
i
know
my
letter
was
a
cruel
one
and
to
you
quite
unwarranted
but
i
had
a
reason
for
writing
it
and
the
reason
was
because
i
felt
that
i
ought
not
to
deceive
you
any
longer
you
see
darling
i
am
frank
and
open
yes
i
have
deceived
you
i
am
terribly
ashamed
and
downhearted
i
have
tried
to
conceal
my
grief
even
from
you
but
it
is
impossible
i
love
you
as
much
as
i
ever
loved
you
and
i
swear
to
you
that
i
have
never
once
wavered
grim
circumstance
forced
me
to
write
to
you
as
i
did
forgive
me
i
beg
of
you
if
it
is
true
what
flockart
says
then
send
me
a
telegram
and
come
here
to
see
me
if
it
be
false
then
i
shall
know
by
your
silence
i
love
you
my
own
my
my
dearest
heart
i
look
at
your
photograph
which
smiles
at
me
yes
you
love
me
with
many
fond
and
sweet
kisses
like
those
i
gave
you
in
the
days
of
our
happiness
my
love
my
king
she
read
the
letter
carefully
through
placed
it
in
an
envelope
and
marking
it
private
addressed
it
to
walter
chambers
in
the
temple
whence
she
knew
it
must
be
forwarded
if
he
were
away
then
putting
on
her
tam
o
shanter
she
went
out
to
the
village
grocer
where
she
posted
it
so
that
it
left
by
the
early
morning
mail
when
would
his
welcome
telegram
arrive
she
calculated
that
he
would
get
the
letter
by
and
by
one
she
could
receive
his
reply
his
reassurance
of
love
so
she
went
to
her
bed
with
its
white
dimity
hangings
more
calm
and
composed
than
for
months
before
for
a
long
time
she
lay
awake
thinking
of
him
listening
hour
by
hour
to
the
chiming
bells
of
the
old
norman
church
they
marked
the
passing
of
the
night
then
she
dropped
off
to
sleep
to
be
awakened
by
the
sun
streaming
into
the
room
that
same
morning
away
up
in
the
highlands
at
glencardine
sir
henry
had
groped
his
way
across
the
library
to
his
accustomed
chair
and
hill
had
placed
before
him
one
of
the
shallow
drawers
of
the
cabinet
of
there
were
fully
half
a
dozen
which
had
been
sent
to
him
by
the
curator
of
the
museum
at
norwich
of
seals
recently
acquired
by
that
institution
the
blind
man
had
put
aside
that
morning
to
examine
them
and
settled
himself
to
his
task
with
the
keen
and
pleasurable
anticipation
of
the
expert
they
were
very
fine
specimens
the
blind
man
sitting
alone
selected
one
and
fingering
it
very
carefully
for
a
long
time
at
last
made
out
its
design
and
the
inscription
upon
it
the
seal
of
abbot
simon
de
luton
of
the
early
thirteenth
century
he
said
slowly
to
himself
the
wolf
guards
the
head
of
edmund
as
it
does
in
the
seal
of
the
benedictine
abbey
of
bury
edmunds
while
the
virgin
with
the
child
is
over
the
canopy
and
the
verse
is
indeed
curious
for
its
quaintness
virgo
deum
fert
dux
capud
aufert
quod
lupus
hic
fert
then
he
again
retraced
the
letters
with
his
sensitive
fingers
to
reassure
himself
that
he
had
made
no
mistake
the
next
he
drew
towards
him
proved
to
be
the
seal
of
the
of
the
grey
friars
of
cambridge
a
pointed
one
used
about
the
year
which
to
himself
he
declared
in
heraldic
language
to
bear
the
device
of
a
cross
raguly
debruised
by
a
spear
and
a
crown
of
thorns
in
bend
dexter
and
a
sponge
on
a
staff
in
bend
sinister
between
two
threefold
in
base
surely
a
formidable
array
of
the
instruments
used
in
the
passion
deeply
interested
and
speaking
to
himself
aloud
as
was
his
habit
when
alone
he
examined
them
one
after
the
other
among
the
collection
were
the
seals
of
berengar
de
brolis
plebanus
of
pacina
in
syracuse
and
those
of
the
commune
of
beauvais
mathilde
or
mahaut
daughter
of
henri
duke
of
brabant
the
town
of
oudenbourg
in
west
flanders
and
of
the
of
the
carmelite
order
at
palermo
jacobus
de
gnapet
bishop
of
rennes
and
of
bondi
marquis
of
sasolini
of
bologna
he
had
almost
concluded
when
goslin
the
frenchman
having
breakfasted
alone
in
the
entered
ah
sir
henry
he
exclaimed
at
work
so
early
the
study
of
seals
must
be
very
fascinating
to
you
though
i
confess
that
for
myself
i
could
never
see
in
them
very
much
to
interest
one
no
to
the
ordinary
person
my
dear
goslin
it
appears
no
doubt
a
most
dryasdust
study
but
to
a
man
afflicted
like
myself
it
is
the
only
study
that
he
can
pursue
for
with
his
finger
tips
he
can
learn
the
devices
and
decipher
the
inscriptions
the
blind
baronet
declared
take
for
instance
only
this
little
collection
of
a
dozen
or
so
impressions
which
they
have
so
kindly
sent
to
me
from
norwich
each
one
of
them
tells
me
something
its
device
its
general
character
its
heraldry
its
inscription
are
all
highly
instructive
for
the
collector
there
are
opportunities
for
the
study
of
the
historical
allusions
the
emblematology
and
imagery
the
hagiology
the
biographical
and
topographical
episodes
and
the
other
peculiarities
and
idiosyncrasies
in
all
the
seals
he
possesses
goslin
like
most
other
people
had
been
many
times
bored
by
the
old
man
technical
discourses
upon
his
hobby
but
he
never
showed
it
he
just
the
same
as
other
people
made
pretence
of
being
interested
yes
he
remarked
they
must
be
most
instructive
to
the
student
i
recollect
seeing
a
great
quantity
in
the
bargello
at
florence
ah
a
very
fine
collection
part
of
the
medici
collection
and
contains
some
of
the
finest
italian
and
spanish
specimens
remarked
the
blind
connoisseur
birch
of
the
british
museum
is
quite
right
in
declaring
that
the
seal
portable
and
abounding
in
detail
not
difficult
of
acquisition
nor
hard
to
read
if
we
set
about
deciphering
the
story
it
has
to
tell
takes
us
back
as
we
look
upon
it
to
the
very
time
of
its
making
and
sets
us
as
it
were
face
to
face
with
the
actual
owners
of
the
relic
the
frenchman
sighed
he
saw
he
was
in
for
a
long
dissertation
and
moving
uneasily
towards
the
window
changed
the
topic
of
conversation
by
saying
i
had
a
long
letter
from
paris
this
morning
krail
is
back
again
it
appears
ah
that
man
cried
the
other
impatiently
when
will
his
extraordinary
energies
be
suppressed
they
are
watching
him
carefully
i
suppose
of
course
replied
the
frenchman
he
left
paris
about
a
month
ago
but
unfortunately
the
men
watching
him
did
not
follow
he
took
train
for
berlin
and
has
been
absent
until
now
we
ought
to
know
where
he
been
goslin
declared
the
elder
man
what
fool
was
it
who
keeping
him
under
surveillance
allowed
him
to
slip
from
paris
the
russian
tchernine
i
thought
him
a
clever
fellow
but
it
seems
that
he
a
bungler
after
all
but
while
we
keep
krail
at
arm
length
as
we
are
doing
what
have
we
to
fear
asked
goslin
yes
but
how
long
can
we
keep
him
at
arm
length
queried
sir
henry
you
know
the
kind
of
man
one
of
the
most
extraordinarily
inventive
in
europe
no
secret
is
safe
from
him
do
you
know
goslin
he
added
in
a
changed
voice
i
live
nowadays
somehow
in
constant
apprehension
you
never
possessed
the
same
since
you
found
mademoiselle
gabrielle
with
the
safe
open
he
remarked
no
murie
or
some
other
man
she
knows
must
have
induced
her
to
do
that
and
take
copies
of
those
documents
fortunately
i
suspected
an
attempt
and
baited
the
trap
accordingly
what
caused
you
to
suspect
because
more
than
once
both
murie
and
the
girl
seemed
to
be
seized
by
an
unusual
desire
to
pry
into
my
business
you
do
think
that
our
friend
flockart
had
anything
to
do
with
the
affair
the
frenchman
suggested
no
no
not
in
the
least
i
know
flockart
too
well
declared
the
old
man
once
i
looked
upon
him
as
my
enemy
but
i
have
now
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
is
a
friend
a
very
good
friend
the
frenchman
pulled
a
rather
wry
face
and
remained
silent
i
know
sir
henry
went
on
i
know
quite
well
that
his
constant
association
with
my
wife
has
caused
a
good
deal
of
gossip
but
i
have
dismissed
it
all
with
the
contempt
that
such
attempted
scandal
deserves
it
has
been
put
about
by
a
pack
of
women
who
are
jealous
of
my
good
looks
and
her
in
dress
are
not
flockart
and
mademoiselle
also
good
friends
inquired
goslin
no
i
happen
to
know
that
they
are
not
and
that
very
fact
in
itself
shows
me
that
gabrielle
in
trying
to
get
at
the
secret
of
my
business
was
not
aided
by
flockart
for
it
was
he
who
exposed
her
yes
remarked
the
frenchman
so
you
told
me
before
have
you
heard
from
mademoiselle
lately
only
twice
since
she
has
left
here
was
the
old
man
bitter
reply
and
that
was
twice
too
frequently
i
done
with
her
goslin
done
with
her
entirely
never
in
all
my
life
did
i
receive
such
a
crushing
blow
as
when
i
found
that
she
in
whom
i
reposed
the
utmost
confidence
had
played
her
own
father
false
and
might
have
ruined
him
yes
remarked
the
other
sympathetically
it
was
a
great
blow
to
you
i
know
but
will
you
not
forgive
mademoiselle
forgive
her
he
cried
fiercely
forgive
her
never
the
frenchman
who
had
always
been
a
great
favourite
with
gabrielle
sighed
slightly
and
gave
his
shoulders
a
shrug
of
regret
why
do
you
ask
that
inquired
sir
henry
when
she
herself
admitted
that
she
had
been
at
the
safe
because
and
the
other
hesitated
well
for
several
reasons
the
story
of
your
quarrel
with
mademoiselle
has
leaked
out
the
whispers
eh
goslin
laughed
the
old
man
in
defiance
let
the
people
believe
what
they
will
my
daughter
shall
never
return
to
glencardine
never
as
he
had
been
speaking
the
door
had
opened
and
james
flockart
stood
upon
the
threshold
he
had
overheard
the
blind
man
words
and
as
he
came
forward
he
smiled
more
in
satisfaction
than
in
greeting
chapter
xxix
contains
a
further
mystery
my
dear
edgar
when
i
met
you
in
the
devonshire
club
last
night
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
own
eyes
fancy
you
turning
up
again
yes
strange
is
it
how
two
men
may
drift
apart
for
years
and
then
suddenly
meet
in
a
club
as
we
have
done
murie
being
with
those
fellows
who
were
anxious
to
go
along
and
see
the
show
at
the
empire
last
night
i
had
no
opportunity
of
having
a
chat
with
you
my
dear
old
chap
that
why
i
asked
you
to
look
in
the
two
men
were
seated
in
walter
dingy
chambers
on
the
second
floor
in
court
temple
the
room
was
an
old
and
rather
frowsy
one
with
shabby
leather
furniture
from
which
the
stuffing
protruded
panelled
walls
a
carpet
almost
threadbare
and
a
formidable
array
of
volumes
in
the
cases
lining
one
wall
the
place
was
heavy
with
as
the
pair
reclining
in
were
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
very
excellent
cigars
walter
visitor
was
a
tall
dark
man
some
six
or
seven
years
his
senior
a
rather
spare
young
fellow
whose
clothes
were
of
unmistakable
foreign
cut
and
whose
moustache
was
carefully
trained
to
an
upward
trend
no
second
glance
was
required
to
decide
that
edgar
hamilton
was
a
person
who
having
lived
a
long
time
on
the
continent
had
acquired
the
cosmopolitan
manner
both
in
gesture
and
in
dress
well
exclaimed
murie
at
last
blowing
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
his
lips
since
we
parted
at
oxford
i
been
called
to
the
bar
as
you
see
as
for
practice
well
i
have
any
the
wants
me
to
go
in
for
politics
so
i
trying
to
please
him
by
getting
my
hand
in
i
make
an
odd
speech
or
two
sometimes
in
villages
and
i
hope
one
day
to
find
myself
the
adopted
candidate
for
some
borough
or
other
last
year
i
was
sent
round
the
world
by
my
fond
parents
in
order
to
obtain
a
broader
view
of
life
is
it
not
tacitus
who
says
cuique
vita
obscura
yes
my
dear
fellow
replied
hamilton
stretching
himself
lazily
in
his
chair
and
surely
we
can
say
with
martial
est
vivere
sed
valere
i
am
well
therefore
i
am
alive
mine
has
been
a
rather
curious
career
up
to
the
present
i
only
once
heard
of
you
after
oxford
through
arthur
price
who
was
you
remember
at
balliol
he
wrote
that
he
spoken
one
night
to
you
when
at
supper
at
the
savoy
you
had
a
bevy
of
beauties
with
you
he
said
both
men
laughed
in
the
old
days
edgar
hamilton
had
been
essentially
a
ladies
man
but
since
they
had
parted
one
evening
on
the
at
oxford
hamilton
had
gone
up
to
town
and
completely
out
of
the
life
of
walter
murie
they
had
not
met
until
the
previous
evening
when
walter
having
dined
at
the
devonshire
that
comfortable
club
in
james
street
which
was
the
famous
in
the
days
of
the
dandies
he
had
met
his
old
friend
in
the
strangers
the
guest
of
a
city
stockbroker
who
was
entertaining
a
party
a
hurried
greeting
of
surprise
and
an
invitation
to
call
in
at
the
temple
resulted
in
that
meeting
on
that
grey
afternoon
six
years
had
gone
since
they
had
parted
and
judging
from
exterior
he
had
been
pretty
prosperous
walter
was
laughing
and
commenting
upon
it
when
his
friend
removing
his
cigar
from
his
lips
said
my
dear
fellow
my
success
has
been
entirely
due
to
one
incident
which
is
quite
romantic
in
fact
if
anybody
wrote
it
in
a
book
people
would
declare
it
to
be
fiction
that
interesting
tell
me
all
about
it
my
own
life
has
been
humdrum
enough
in
all
conscience
as
a
budding
politician
i
have
to
browse
upon
and
chew
statistics
and
mine
has
been
one
of
travel
adventure
and
considerable
excitement
declared
hamilton
six
months
after
i
left
oxford
i
found
myself
out
in
transcaucasia
as
a
newspaper
correspondent
as
you
know
i
often
wrote
articles
for
some
of
the
more
precious
papers
when
at
college
well
one
of
them
sent
me
out
to
travel
through
the
disturbed
kurdish
districts
i
had
a
tough
time
from
the
start
i
was
out
with
a
cossack
party
in
thai
aras
valley
east
of
erivan
for
six
months
and
wrote
lots
of
articles
which
created
a
good
deal
of
sensation
here
in
england
you
may
have
seen
them
but
they
were
anonymous
the
life
of
excitement
sometimes
fighting
and
at
others
in
ambush
in
the
mountains
suited
me
admirably
for
i
a
born
adventurer
i
believe
one
day
however
a
strange
thing
happened
i
was
riding
along
alone
through
one
of
the
mountain
passes
towards
the
caspian
when
i
discovered
three
wild
kurds
maltreating
a
girl
believing
her
to
be
a
russian
i
called
upon
them
to
release
her
for
she
was
little
more
than
a
child
and
as
they
did
not
i
shot
two
of
the
men
the
third
shot
and
plugged
me
rather
badly
in
the
leg
but
i
had
the
satisfaction
that
my
shots
attracted
my
cossack
companions
who
coming
quickly
on
the
spot
killed
all
three
of
the
girl
assailants
and
released
her
by
jove
laughed
murie
was
she
pretty
not
extraordinarily
a
girl
of
about
fifteen
dressed
in
european
clothes
i
fainted
from
loss
of
blood
and
do
remember
anything
else
until
i
found
myself
in
a
tent
with
two
cossacks
patching
up
my
wound
when
i
came
to
she
rushed
forward
and
thanked
me
profusely
for
saving
her
to
my
surprise
she
spoke
in
french
and
on
inquiry
i
found
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
certain
baron
conrad
de
hetzendorf
an
austrian
who
possessed
a
house
in
budapest
and
a
ch√¢teau
at
semlin
in
south
hungary
she
told
us
a
curious
story
her
father
had
some
business
in
transcaucasia
and
she
had
induced
him
to
take
her
with
him
on
his
journey
only
certain
districts
of
the
country
were
disturbed
and
apparently
with
their
guide
and
escort
they
had
unwittingly
entered
the
aras
region
one
of
the
most
lawless
of
them
all
in
ignorance
of
what
was
in
progress
she
and
her
father
accompanied
by
a
guide
and
four
cossacks
had
been
riding
along
when
they
met
a
party
of
kurds
who
had
attacked
them
both
father
and
daughter
had
been
seized
whereupon
she
had
lost
consciousness
from
fright
and
when
she
came
to
again
found
that
the
four
cossacks
had
been
killed
her
father
had
been
taken
off
and
she
was
alone
in
the
brutal
hands
of
those
three
tribesmen
as
soon
as
she
had
told
us
this
the
officer
of
the
cossacks
to
which
i
had
attached
myself
called
the
men
together
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
whole
body
went
forth
to
chase
the
kurds
and
rescue
the
baron
one
big
cossack
in
his
long
coat
and
astrakhan
cap
was
left
to
look
after
me
while
nicosia
that
was
the
girl
name
was
also
left
to
assist
him
after
three
days
they
returned
bringing
with
them
the
baron
whose
delight
at
finding
his
daughter
safe
and
unharmed
was
unbounded
they
had
fought
the
kurds
and
defeated
them
killing
nearly
twenty
ah
my
dear
murie
you
have
any
notion
of
the
lawless
state
of
that
country
just
then
and
i
fear
it
is
pretty
much
the
same
now
well
go
on
urged
his
friend
what
about
the
girl
i
suppose
you
fell
in
love
with
her
and
all
that
eh
no
you
mistaken
there
old
chap
was
his
reply
when
she
explained
to
her
father
what
had
happened
the
baron
thanked
me
very
warmly
and
invited
me
to
visit
him
in
budapest
when
my
leg
grew
strong
again
he
was
a
man
of
about
fifty
who
i
found
spoke
english
very
well
nicosia
also
spoke
english
for
she
had
explained
to
me
that
her
mother
now
dead
had
been
a
londoner
the
baron
business
in
transcaucasia
was
he
told
me
vaguely
in
connection
with
the
survey
of
a
new
railway
which
the
russian
government
was
projecting
eastward
from
erivan
for
two
days
he
remained
with
us
but
during
those
days
my
wound
was
extremely
painful
owing
to
lack
of
surgical
appliances
so
we
spoke
of
very
little
else
besides
the
horrible
atrocities
committed
by
the
kurds
he
pressed
me
to
visit
him
and
then
with
an
escort
of
our
cossacks
he
and
his
daughter
left
for
tiflis
whence
he
took
train
back
to
hungary
for
six
months
i
remained
still
leading
that
roving
adventurous
life
my
leg
was
well
again
but
my
journalistic
commission
was
at
an
end
and
one
day
i
found
myself
in
odessa
very
short
of
funds
i
recollected
the
baron
invitation
to
budapest
therefore
i
took
train
there
and
found
his
residence
to
be
one
of
those
great
white
houses
on
the
franz
josef
quay
he
received
me
with
marked
enthusiasm
and
compelled
me
to
be
his
guest
during
the
first
week
i
was
there
i
told
him
in
confidence
my
position
whereupon
he
offered
me
a
very
lucrative
post
as
his
secretary
a
post
which
i
have
retained
until
this
moment
and
the
girl
walter
asked
much
interested
oh
she
finished
her
education
in
dresden
and
in
paris
and
now
lives
mostly
with
her
aunt
in
vienna
was
hamilton
response
quite
recently
she
become
engaged
to
young
count
de
solwegen
the
son
of
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
austria
i
thought
you
probably
become
the
happy
lover
lover
cried
his
friend
how
could
a
poor
devil
like
myself
ever
aspire
to
the
hand
of
the
daughter
of
the
baron
de
hetzendorf
the
name
does
convey
much
to
you
i
suppose
no
i
do
take
much
interest
in
unknown
foreigners
i
confess
replied
walter
with
a
smile
ah
you
not
a
cosmopolitan
nor
a
financier
or
you
would
know
the
strings
which
are
pulled
by
conrad
de
hetzendorf
or
the
curious
stories
afloat
concerning
him
curious
stories
echoed
murie
tell
me
some
i
always
interested
in
anything
mysterious
hamilton
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
well
old
chap
to
tell
you
the
truth
even
though
i
got
such
a
comfortable
and
lucrative
post
i
even
after
these
years
considerably
mystified
how
by
the
real
nature
of
the
baron
business
oh
he
a
mysterious
person
is
he
very
though
i
his
confidential
secretary
and
deal
with
his
affairs
in
his
absence
yet
in
some
matters
he
is
remarkably
close
as
though
he
fears
me
you
live
always
in
budapest
i
suppose
no
in
summer
we
are
at
the
country
house
a
big
place
overlooking
the
danube
outside
semlin
and
commanding
a
wide
view
of
the
great
hungarian
plain
the
baron
transacts
his
business
there
eh
from
there
or
from
budapest
his
business
is
solely
with
an
office
in
the
boulevard
des
capucines
in
paris
and
a
registered
telegraphic
address
also
in
paris
well
there
nothing
very
mysterious
in
that
surely
some
business
matters
must
of
necessity
be
conducted
with
secrecy
i
know
all
that
my
dear
fellow
but
and
he
hesitated
as
though
fearing
to
take
his
friend
into
his
confidence
but
what
well
but
there
no
you
laugh
at
me
if
i
told
you
the
real
reason
of
my
uneasiness
i
certainly
wo
my
dear
hamilton
murie
assured
him
we
are
friends
dear
old
chap
just
as
we
were
at
college
surely
it
is
not
the
place
of
a
man
to
poke
fun
at
his
friend
the
argument
was
apparently
convincing
the
baron
secretary
smoked
on
in
thoughtful
silence
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
wall
in
front
of
him
well
he
said
at
last
if
you
promise
to
view
the
matter
in
all
seriousness
i
tell
you
briefly
it
this
of
course
you
never
been
to
semlin
or
zimony
as
they
call
it
in
the
magyar
tongue
to
understand
aright
i
must
describe
the
place
in
the
extreme
south
of
hungary
where
the
river
save
joins
the
danube
the
town
of
semlin
guards
the
frontier
upon
a
steep
hill
five
kilometres
from
the
town
stands
the
baron
residence
a
long
rather
inartistic
white
building
which
however
is
very
luxuriously
furnished
comparatively
modern
it
stands
near
the
ruins
of
a
great
old
castle
of
hetzendorf
which
commands
a
wide
sweep
of
the
danube
now
amid
those
ruins
strange
noises
are
sometimes
heard
and
it
is
said
that
upon
all
who
hear
them
falls
some
terrible
calamity
i
not
superstitious
but
i
heard
them
on
three
occasions
and
somehow
well
somehow
i
can
not
get
rid
of
an
uncanny
feeling
that
some
catastrophe
is
to
befall
me
i
ca
go
back
to
semlin
i
unnerved
and
dare
not
return
there
noises
cried
walter
murie
what
are
they
like
he
asked
quickly
starting
from
his
chair
and
staring
at
his
friend
they
seem
to
emanate
from
nowhere
and
are
like
deep
but
distant
whispers
so
plain
they
were
that
i
could
have
sworn
that
some
one
was
speaking
and
in
english
too
does
the
baron
know
yes
i
told
him
and
he
appeared
greatly
alarmed
indeed
he
gave
me
leave
of
absence
to
come
home
to
england
well
exclaimed
murie
what
you
tell
me
old
chap
is
most
extraordinary
why
there
is
almost
an
exactly
similar
legend
connected
with
glencardine
glencardine
cried
his
friend
glencardine
castle
in
scotland
heard
of
that
do
you
know
the
place
the
estate
marches
with
my
father
therefore
i
know
it
well
how
extraordinary
that
there
should
be
almost
exactly
the
same
legend
concerning
a
hungarian
castle
who
is
the
owner
of
glencardine
sir
henry
heyburn
a
friend
of
mine
heyburn
echoed
hamilton
heyburn
the
blind
man
he
gasped
grasping
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
staring
back
at
his
companion
and
he
is
your
friend
you
know
his
daughter
then
yes
i
know
gabrielle
was
walter
reply
as
there
flashed
across
him
the
recollection
of
that
passionate
letter
to
which
he
had
not
replied
why
is
she
also
your
friend
she
certainly
is
hamilton
was
silent
he
saw
that
he
was
treading
dangerous
ground
the
legend
of
glencardine
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
old
magyar
stronghold
of
hetzendorf
gabrielle
heyburn
was
murie
friend
therefore
he
resolved
to
say
no
more
gabrielle
heyburn
chapter
xxx
reveals
something
to
hamilton
edgar
hamilton
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
dingy
inartistic
windows
of
the
chambers
opposite
the
man
before
him
was
acquainted
with
gabrielle
heyburn
for
over
a
year
he
had
not
been
in
london
he
recollected
the
last
occasion
recollected
it
alas
only
too
well
his
thin
countenance
wore
a
puzzled
anxious
expression
the
expression
of
a
man
face
to
face
with
a
great
difficulty
tell
me
walter
he
said
at
last
what
kind
of
place
is
glencardine
castle
what
kind
of
man
is
sir
henry
heyburn
glencardine
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
estates
in
scotland
it
lies
between
perth
and
stirling
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
castle
where
the
great
marquis
of
glencardine
who
was
such
a
figure
in
scottish
history
was
born
stands
perched
up
above
a
deep
delightful
glen
and
some
little
distance
off
stands
the
modern
house
built
in
great
part
from
the
ruins
of
the
stronghold
and
there
are
noises
heard
there
the
same
as
at
hetzendorf
you
say
well
the
countryfolk
believe
that
on
certain
nights
there
can
be
heard
in
the
castle
courtyard
distinct
whispering
the
counsel
of
the
devil
himself
to
certain
conspirators
who
took
the
life
of
the
notorious
cardinal
setoun
has
any
one
actually
heard
them
they
say
so
or
at
any
rate
several
persons
after
declaring
that
they
had
heard
them
have
died
quite
suddenly
hamilton
pursed
his
lips
well
he
exclaimed
that
really
most
remarkable
practically
the
same
legend
is
current
in
south
hungary
regarding
hetzendorf
strange
very
strange
very
remarked
the
heir
to
the
great
estate
of
connachan
but
after
all
can
not
one
very
often
trace
the
same
legend
through
the
folklore
of
various
countries
i
remember
i
once
attended
a
lecture
upon
that
very
interesting
subject
oh
of
course
many
ancient
legends
have
sprung
from
the
same
germ
so
that
often
we
have
practically
the
same
all
over
europe
but
this
it
seems
to
me
is
no
fairy
story
well
laughed
murie
the
history
of
glencardine
castle
and
the
historic
family
is
so
full
of
stirring
episodes
that
i
really
wonder
that
the
ruins
are
believed
to
be
the
abode
of
something
supernatural
my
father
possesses
some
of
the
family
papers
while
sir
henry
when
he
bought
glencardine
also
acquired
a
quantity
only
a
year
ago
he
told
me
that
he
had
had
an
application
from
a
historical
writer
for
access
to
them
as
he
was
about
to
write
a
book
upon
the
family
then
you
know
sir
henry
well
very
well
indeed
i
often
his
guest
and
frequently
shoot
over
the
place
i
heard
that
lady
heyburn
is
a
very
pretty
woman
remarked
the
other
glancing
at
his
friend
with
a
peculiar
look
some
declare
her
to
be
beautiful
but
to
myself
i
confess
she
not
very
attractive
there
are
stories
about
her
eh
hamilton
said
as
there
are
about
every
woman
beauty
can
not
escape
unjust
criticism
or
the
scars
of
lying
tongues
people
pity
sir
henry
i
heard
they
of
course
sympathise
with
him
poor
old
gentleman
because
blind
his
is
indeed
a
terrible
affliction
only
fancy
the
change
from
a
brilliant
parliamentary
career
to
idleness
darkness
and
knitting
i
suppose
he
very
wealthy
he
must
be
the
price
he
paid
for
glencardine
was
a
very
heavy
one
and
besides
that
he
has
two
other
places
as
well
as
a
house
in
park
street
and
a
villa
at
san
remo
cotton
or
steel
or
soap
or
some
other
domestic
necessity
i
suppose
murie
shrugged
his
shoulders
nobody
knows
he
answered
the
source
of
sir
henry
vast
wealth
is
a
profound
mystery
his
friend
smiled
but
said
nothing
walter
murie
had
risen
to
obtain
matches
therefore
he
did
not
notice
the
curious
expression
upon
his
friend
face
a
look
which
betrayed
that
he
knew
more
than
he
intended
to
tell
those
noises
heard
in
the
castle
puzzle
me
he
remarked
after
a
few
moments
at
glencardine
they
are
known
as
the
whispers
murie
remarked
by
jove
i
like
to
hear
them
i
do
think
there
be
much
chance
of
that
old
chap
laughed
the
other
they
only
heard
by
those
doomed
to
an
early
death
i
may
be
who
knows
he
asked
gloomily
well
if
i
were
you
i
would
anticipate
catastrophe
no
said
his
friend
in
a
more
serious
tone
i
already
heard
those
at
hetzendorf
and
well
i
confess
they
aroused
in
my
mind
some
very
uncanny
apprehensions
but
did
you
really
hear
them
are
you
sure
they
were
not
imagination
in
the
night
sounds
always
become
both
magnified
and
distorted
yes
i
certain
of
what
i
heard
i
was
careful
to
convince
myself
that
it
was
not
imagination
but
actual
reality
walter
murie
smiled
dubiously
sir
henry
scouts
the
idea
of
the
whispers
being
heard
at
glencardine
he
said
and
strangely
enough
so
does
the
baron
he
a
most
man
how
curious
that
the
cases
are
almost
parallel
and
yet
so
far
apart
the
baron
has
a
daughter
and
so
has
sir
henry
gabrielle
is
at
glencardine
i
suppose
asked
hamilton
no
she
living
with
a
maiden
aunt
at
an
village
in
northamptonshire
called
woodnewton
oh
i
thought
she
always
lived
at
glencardine
and
acted
as
her
father
right
hand
she
did
until
a
few
months
ago
when
and
he
paused
well
he
went
on
i
do
know
exactly
what
occurred
except
that
she
left
suddenly
and
has
not
since
returned
her
mother
perhaps
no
girl
of
spirit
gets
on
well
with
her
stepmother
possibly
that
walter
said
he
knew
the
truth
but
had
no
desire
to
tell
even
his
old
friend
of
the
allegation
against
the
girl
whom
he
loved
hamilton
noted
the
name
of
the
village
and
sat
wondering
at
what
the
young
barrister
had
just
told
him
it
had
aroused
suspicions
within
him
strange
suspicions
they
sat
together
for
another
and
before
they
parted
arranged
to
lunch
together
at
the
savoy
in
two
days
time
turning
out
of
the
temple
edgar
hamilton
walked
along
the
strand
to
the
metropole
in
northumberland
avenue
where
he
was
staying
his
mind
was
full
of
what
his
friend
had
said
full
of
that
curious
legend
of
glencardine
which
coincided
so
strangely
with
that
of
hetzendorf
the
jostling
crowd
in
the
busy
london
thoroughfare
he
did
not
see
he
was
away
again
on
the
hill
outside
the
hungarian
town
with
the
broad
danube
shining
in
the
white
moonbeams
he
saw
the
grim
walls
that
had
for
centuries
withstood
the
brunt
of
battle
with
the
turks
and
from
them
came
the
whispering
voice
the
voice
said
to
be
that
of
the
evil
one
the
tziganes
that
race
of
gipsy
wanderers
the
women
with
their
skirts
and
and
the
men
with
the
wonderful
old
silver
filigree
buttons
upon
their
coats
related
to
him
many
weird
stories
regarding
hetzendorf
and
the
meaning
of
those
whispers
yet
none
of
their
stories
was
so
curious
as
that
which
murie
had
just
told
him
similar
sounds
were
actually
heard
in
the
old
castle
up
in
the
highlands
his
thoughts
were
wholly
absorbed
in
that
one
extraordinary
fact
he
went
to
the
of
the
hotel
and
obtaining
a
searched
it
in
vain
then
ordering
from
a
waiter
a
map
of
england
he
eagerly
searched
northamptonshire
and
discovered
the
whereabouts
of
woodnewton
therefore
that
night
he
left
london
for
oundle
and
put
up
at
the
talbot
at
ten
on
the
following
morning
after
making
a
detour
he
alighted
from
a
dogcart
before
the
little
inn
called
the
westmorland
arms
at
apethorpe
just
outside
the
of
apethorpe
hall
and
making
excuse
to
the
groom
that
he
was
going
for
a
walk
he
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
over
the
little
bridge
and
up
the
hill
to
woodnewton
the
morning
was
dark
and
gloomy
with
threatening
rain
and
the
distance
was
somewhat
greater
than
he
had
calculated
from
the
map
at
last
however
he
came
to
the
entrance
to
the
long
village
street
with
its
church
and
its
rows
of
low
thatched
cottages
a
tiny
inn
called
the
white
lion
stood
before
him
therefore
he
entered
and
calling
for
some
ale
commenced
to
chat
with
the
old
lady
who
kept
the
place
after
the
usual
conventionalities
about
the
weather
he
said
i
suppose
you
do
have
very
many
strangers
in
woodnewton
eh
not
many
sir
was
her
reply
we
see
a
few
people
from
oundle
and
northampton
in
the
summer
holiday
folk
but
that
all
then
by
dint
of
skilful
questioning
he
elucidated
the
fact
that
old
miss
heyburn
lived
in
the
tiled
house
further
up
the
village
and
that
her
niece
who
lived
with
her
had
passed
along
with
her
dog
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
and
taken
the
footpath
towards
southwick
ascertaining
this
he
was
all
anxiety
to
follow
her
but
knowing
how
sharp
are
village
eyes
upon
a
stranger
he
was
compelled
to
conceal
his
eagerness
light
another
cigarette
and
continue
his
chat
at
last
however
he
wished
the
woman
and
strolling
up
the
village
turned
into
a
narrow
lane
which
led
across
a
farmyard
to
a
footpath
which
ran
across
the
fields
following
a
brook
eager
to
overtake
the
girl
he
sped
along
as
quickly
as
possible
gabrielle
heyburn
he
ejaculated
speaking
to
himself
her
name
was
all
that
escaped
his
lips
a
dozen
times
that
morning
he
had
repeated
it
uttering
it
in
a
tone
almost
of
wonder
almost
of
awe
across
several
ploughed
fields
he
went
leaving
the
brook
and
skirting
a
high
hedge
to
the
side
of
a
small
wood
he
followed
the
path
for
nearly
when
of
a
sudden
he
emerged
from
a
narrow
lane
between
two
hedgerows
into
a
large
pasture
before
him
he
saw
standing
together
on
the
brink
of
the
river
nene
two
figures
a
man
and
a
woman
the
girl
was
dressed
in
blue
serge
and
wore
a
white
woollen
while
the
man
had
on
a
dark
grey
overcoat
with
a
brown
felt
hat
and
nearby
with
his
eye
upon
some
sheep
grazing
some
distance
away
stood
a
big
collie
hamilton
started
and
drew
back
the
pair
were
standing
together
in
earnest
conversation
the
man
facing
him
the
girl
with
her
back
turned
what
does
this
mean
gasped
hamilton
aloud
what
can
this
secret
meeting
mean
why
yes
i
certainly
not
mistaken
it
krail
felix
krail
by
all
that
amazing
chapter
xxxi
describes
a
curious
circumstance
to
hamilton
it
was
evident
that
the
man
krail
now
smartly
dressed
in
country
tweeds
was
telling
the
girl
something
which
surprised
her
he
was
speaking
quickly
making
involuntary
gestures
which
betrayed
his
foreign
birth
while
she
stood
pale
surprised
and
yet
defiant
the
baron
secretary
was
not
near
enough
to
overhear
their
words
indeed
he
remained
there
in
concealment
in
order
to
watch
why
had
gabrielle
met
felix
krail
of
all
men
she
was
beautiful
yes
there
could
be
no
two
opinions
upon
that
point
edgar
decided
and
yet
how
strange
it
all
was
how
very
remarkable
how
romantic
the
man
was
evidently
endeavouring
to
impress
upon
the
girl
some
plain
truths
to
which
at
first
she
refused
to
listen
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
impatiently
and
swung
her
before
her
in
an
attempt
to
remain
unconcerned
but
from
where
hamilton
was
standing
he
could
plainly
detect
her
agitation
whatever
krail
had
told
her
had
caused
her
much
nervous
anxiety
what
could
it
be
across
the
meadows
beyond
the
river
could
be
seen
the
of
old
fotheringhay
church
with
the
mound
behind
where
once
stood
the
castle
where
mary
met
her
doom
and
as
the
baron
secretary
watched
he
saw
that
the
attitude
was
gradually
changing
from
persuasive
to
threatening
he
was
speaking
quickly
probably
in
french
making
wild
gestures
with
his
hands
while
she
had
drawn
back
with
an
expression
of
alarm
she
was
now
it
seemed
frightened
at
the
man
and
to
edgar
hamilton
this
increased
the
interest
tenfold
through
his
mind
there
flashed
the
recollection
of
a
previous
occasion
when
he
had
seen
the
man
now
before
him
he
was
in
different
garb
and
acting
a
very
different
part
but
his
face
was
still
the
same
a
countenance
which
it
was
impossible
to
forget
he
was
watching
the
changing
expression
upon
the
girl
face
would
that
he
could
read
the
secret
hidden
behind
those
wonderful
eyes
he
had
quite
unexpectedly
discovered
a
mysterious
circumstance
why
should
krail
meet
her
by
accident
at
that
lonely
spot
the
pair
moved
very
slowly
together
along
the
path
which
having
left
the
way
to
southwick
ran
along
the
very
edge
of
the
broad
winding
river
towards
fotheringhay
until
they
had
crossed
the
wide
and
followed
the
bend
of
the
stream
hamilton
dare
not
emerge
from
his
place
of
concealment
they
might
glance
back
and
discover
him
if
so
then
to
watch
krail
movements
further
would
be
futile
he
saw
that
by
the
exercise
of
caution
he
might
perhaps
learn
something
of
deeper
interest
than
he
imagined
so
he
watched
until
they
disappeared
and
then
sped
along
the
path
they
had
taken
until
he
came
to
a
clump
of
bushes
which
afforded
further
cover
from
where
he
stood
however
he
could
see
nothing
he
could
hear
voices
a
man
voice
raised
in
distinct
threats
and
a
woman
quick
defiant
response
he
walked
round
the
bushes
quickly
trying
to
get
sight
of
the
pair
but
the
river
bent
sharply
at
that
point
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
not
get
a
glimpse
of
them
again
he
heard
krail
speaking
rapidly
in
french
and
still
again
the
girl
response
then
next
instant
there
was
a
shrill
scream
and
a
loud
splash
next
moment
he
had
darted
from
his
to
find
the
girl
struggling
in
the
water
while
at
the
same
time
he
caught
sight
of
krail
disappearing
quickly
around
the
path
had
he
glanced
back
he
could
not
have
seen
the
girl
in
the
stream
at
that
point
the
bank
was
steep
and
the
stillness
of
the
river
and
absence
of
rushes
told
that
it
was
deep
the
girl
was
throwing
up
her
hand
shrieking
for
help
therefore
without
a
second
hesitation
hamilton
who
was
a
good
swimmer
threw
off
his
coat
and
diving
in
was
soon
at
her
side
by
this
time
krail
had
hurried
on
and
could
obtain
no
glimpse
of
what
was
in
progress
owing
to
the
sharp
bend
of
the
river
after
considerable
splashing
hamilton
urging
her
to
remain
calm
he
succeeded
in
bringing
her
to
land
where
they
both
struggled
up
the
bank
dripping
wet
and
more
or
less
exhausted
some
moments
elapsed
before
either
spoke
until
indeed
hamilton
looking
straight
into
the
face
and
bursting
out
laughing
exclaimed
well
i
think
i
have
the
pleasure
of
being
acquainted
with
you
but
i
must
say
that
we
both
look
like
drowned
rats
i
look
horrid
she
declared
staring
at
him
putting
her
hands
to
her
dripping
hair
i
know
i
must
but
i
have
to
thank
you
for
pulling
me
out
only
fancy
mr
hamilton
you
oh
no
thanks
are
required
what
we
must
do
is
to
get
to
some
place
and
get
our
clothes
dried
he
said
do
you
know
this
neighbourhood
oh
yes
straight
over
there
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
is
wyatt
farm
wyatt
will
look
after
us
i
sure
and
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
regarding
her
companion
shyly
her
skirts
clung
around
her
and
the
water
squelched
from
her
shoes
very
well
he
answered
cheerily
let
go
and
see
what
can
be
done
towards
getting
some
dry
kit
i
glad
you
not
too
frightened
a
good
many
girls
would
have
fainted
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
i
certainly
should
have
gone
under
if
you
had
so
fortunately
come
along
she
exclaimed
i
really
do
know
how
to
thank
you
sufficiently
you
actually
saved
my
life
you
know
if
it
were
not
for
you
i
have
been
dead
by
this
time
for
i
ca
swim
a
stroke
by
jove
he
laughed
treating
the
whole
affair
as
a
huge
joke
how
romantic
it
sounds
fancy
meeting
you
again
after
all
this
time
and
saving
your
life
i
suppose
the
papers
will
be
full
of
it
if
they
get
to
know
gallant
rescue
and
all
that
kind
of
twaddle
well
personally
i
hope
the
papers
wo
get
hold
of
this
piece
of
intelligence
she
said
seriously
as
they
walked
together
rather
pitiable
objects
across
the
wide
he
glanced
at
her
pale
face
her
hair
hanging
dank
and
wet
about
it
and
saw
that
even
under
these
disadvantageous
conditions
she
had
grown
more
beautiful
than
before
of
late
he
had
heard
of
her
heard
a
good
deal
of
her
but
had
never
dreamed
that
they
would
meet
again
in
that
manner
how
did
it
happen
he
asked
in
pretence
of
ignorance
of
her
companion
presence
she
raised
her
fine
eyes
to
his
for
a
moment
and
wavered
beneath
his
inquiring
gaze
i
i
well
i
really
do
know
was
her
rather
lame
answer
the
bank
was
very
slippery
and
well
i
suppose
i
walked
too
near
her
reply
struck
him
as
curious
why
did
she
attempt
to
shield
the
man
who
by
his
sudden
flight
was
of
an
attempt
upon
her
life
felix
krail
was
not
a
complete
stranger
to
her
why
had
their
meeting
been
a
clandestine
one
this
and
a
thousand
similar
queries
ran
through
his
mind
as
they
walked
across
the
field
in
the
direction
of
a
long
low
thatched
farmhouse
which
stood
in
the
distance
i
a
complete
stranger
in
these
parts
hamilton
informed
her
i
live
nowadays
mostly
abroad
away
above
the
danube
and
am
only
home
for
a
holiday
and
i
afraid
you
completely
spoilt
your
clothes
she
laughed
looking
at
his
wet
muddy
trousers
and
boots
well
if
i
have
yours
also
are
no
further
good
oh
my
blouse
will
wash
and
i
shall
send
my
skirt
to
the
cleaners
and
it
will
come
back
like
new
she
answered
women
outdoor
clothing
never
suffers
by
a
wetting
we
get
wyatt
to
dry
them
and
then
i
get
home
again
to
my
aunt
in
woodnewton
do
you
know
the
place
i
fancy
i
passed
through
it
this
morning
one
of
those
long
lean
villages
with
a
church
at
the
end
that
it
the
dullest
little
place
in
all
england
i
believe
he
was
struck
by
her
charm
of
manner
though
bedraggled
and
dishevelled
she
was
nevertheless
delightful
and
treated
her
sudden
immersion
with
careless
unconcern
why
had
krail
attempted
to
get
rid
of
her
in
that
manner
what
motive
had
he
they
reached
the
farmhouse
where
wyatt
a
stout
woman
detecting
their
approach
met
them
upon
the
threshold
lawks
miss
heyburn
why
what
happened
she
asked
in
alarm
i
fell
into
the
river
and
this
gentleman
fished
me
out
that
all
laughed
the
girl
we
want
to
dry
our
things
if
we
may
in
a
few
minutes
in
bedrooms
upstairs
they
had
exchanged
their
wet
clothes
for
dry
ones
then
edgar
in
the
farmer
sunday
suit
of
black
and
gabrielle
in
one
of
wyatt
stuff
dresses
in
the
big
folds
of
which
her
slim
little
figure
was
lost
met
again
in
the
spacious
below
they
laughed
heartily
at
the
ridiculous
figure
which
each
presented
and
drank
the
glasses
of
hot
milk
which
the
farmer
wife
pressed
upon
them
old
miss
heyburn
had
been
wyatt
mistress
years
ago
when
she
was
in
service
therefore
she
was
most
solicitous
after
the
girl
welfare
and
truth
to
tell
looked
askance
at
the
stranger
who
had
accompanied
her
gabrielle
too
was
puzzled
to
know
why
hamilton
should
be
there
that
he
now
lived
abroad
beside
the
danube
was
all
the
information
he
had
vouchsafed
regarding
himself
yet
from
certain
remarks
he
had
dropped
she
was
suspicious
she
recollected
only
too
vividly
the
occasion
when
they
had
met
last
and
what
had
occurred
they
sat
together
on
the
bench
outside
the
house
enjoying
the
full
sunshine
while
the
farmer
wife
chattered
on
a
big
fire
had
been
made
in
the
kitchen
and
their
clothes
were
rapidly
drying
hamilton
by
careful
questions
endeavoured
to
obtain
from
the
girl
some
information
concerning
her
dealings
with
the
man
krail
but
she
was
too
wary
it
was
evident
that
she
had
some
distinct
object
in
concealing
the
fact
that
he
had
deliberately
flung
her
into
the
water
after
that
heated
altercation
felix
krail
the
very
name
caused
him
to
clench
his
hands
fortunately
he
knew
the
truth
therefore
that
dastardly
attempt
upon
the
girl
life
should
not
go
unpunished
as
he
sat
there
chatting
with
her
admiring
her
refinement
and
innate
daintiness
he
made
a
vow
within
himself
to
seek
out
that
cowardly
fugitive
and
meet
him
face
to
face
felix
krail
what
could
be
his
object
in
ridding
the
world
of
the
daughter
of
sir
henry
heyburn
what
would
the
man
gain
thereby
he
knew
krail
too
well
to
imagine
that
he
ever
did
anything
without
a
motive
of
gain
so
well
did
he
play
his
cards
always
that
the
police
could
never
lay
hands
upon
him
yet
his
friends
as
he
termed
them
were
among
the
most
dangerous
men
in
all
europe
men
who
were
unscrupulous
and
would
hesitate
at
nothing
in
order
to
accomplish
the
which
they
had
devised
what
was
the
in
this
particular
instance
ay
that
was
the
question
chapter
xxxii
outside
the
window
late
on
the
following
afternoon
gabrielle
was
seated
at
the
piano
in
her
aunt
tiny
her
fingers
running
idly
over
the
keys
her
thoughts
wandering
back
to
the
exciting
adventure
of
the
previous
morning
her
aunt
was
out
visiting
some
old
people
in
connection
with
the
village
clothing
club
therefore
she
sat
gloomily
amusing
herself
at
the
piano
and
thinking
ever
thinking
she
had
been
playing
almost
mechanically
berger
amoureuse
valse
and
some
dreamy
music
from
merry
when
she
suddenly
stopped
and
sat
back
with
her
eyes
fixed
out
of
the
window
upon
the
cottages
opposite
why
was
hamilton
in
that
neighbourhood
he
had
given
her
no
further
information
concerning
himself
he
seemed
to
be
disinclined
to
talk
about
his
recent
movements
he
had
sprung
from
nowhere
just
at
the
critical
moment
when
she
was
in
such
deadly
peril
then
after
their
clothes
had
been
dried
they
had
walked
together
as
far
as
the
little
bridge
at
the
entrance
to
fotheringhay
there
he
had
stopped
bent
gallantly
over
her
hand
congratulated
her
upon
her
escape
and
as
their
ways
lay
in
opposite
directions
she
back
to
woodnewton
and
he
on
to
oundle
they
had
parted
i
hope
miss
heyburn
that
we
may
meet
again
one
day
he
had
laughed
cheerily
as
he
raised
his
hat
then
he
had
turned
away
and
had
been
lost
to
view
round
the
bend
of
the
road
she
was
safe
that
man
whom
she
had
known
long
ago
under
such
strange
circumstances
whom
she
would
probably
never
see
again
had
been
her
rescuer
of
this
curious
and
romantic
fact
she
was
now
thinking
but
where
was
walter
why
had
he
not
replied
to
her
letter
ah
that
was
the
one
thought
which
oppressed
her
always
sleeping
and
waking
day
and
night
why
had
he
not
written
would
he
never
write
again
she
had
at
first
consoled
herself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
probably
on
the
continent
and
that
her
letter
had
not
been
forwarded
but
as
the
days
went
on
and
no
reply
came
the
truth
became
more
and
more
apparent
that
her
lover
the
man
whom
she
adored
and
worshipped
had
put
her
aside
had
accepted
her
at
her
own
estimate
as
worthless
a
thousand
times
she
had
regretted
the
step
she
had
taken
in
writing
that
cruel
letter
before
she
left
glencardine
but
it
was
all
too
late
she
had
tried
to
retract
but
alas
it
was
now
impossible
tears
welled
in
her
splendid
eyes
at
thought
of
the
man
whom
she
had
loved
so
well
the
world
had
indeed
been
cruel
to
her
her
enemies
had
profited
by
her
inexperience
and
she
had
fallen
an
unhappy
victim
of
an
unscrupulous
blackguard
yes
it
was
only
too
true
she
did
not
try
to
conceal
the
ugly
truth
from
herself
yet
she
had
been
compelled
to
keep
walter
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
for
he
loved
her
a
hardness
showed
at
the
corners
of
her
sweet
lips
and
the
tears
rolled
slowly
down
her
cheeks
then
bestirring
herself
with
an
effort
her
white
fingers
ran
over
the
keys
again
and
in
her
sweet
musical
voice
she
sang
that
pretty
so
popular
in
paris
voici
des
tendresses
les
mots
tr√®s
doux
qui
vont
me
griser
ah
dans
tes
bras
des
caresses
je
veux
mourir
pour
revivre
sous
ton
baiser
dans
un
r√™ve
amoureux
bien
loin
sur
la
terre
inconnue
pour
que
longtemps
m√™me
en
rouvrant
les

ce
r√™ve

un
jour
si
bon
mais
si
court
bonheur
de
vivre
diminue
dans
un
moment
the
hour
of
love
how
full
of
burning
love
and
sentiment
she
stopped
reflecting
on
the
meaning
of
those
words
she
was
not
like
the
average
miss
who
knows
only
a
few
french
or
italian
songs
italian
she
loved
even
better
than
french
and
could
read
dante
and
petrarch
in
the
original
while
she
possessed
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
poetry
of
italy
from
the
mediaeval
writers
down
to
carducci
and
with
a
sigh
she
glanced
around
the
small
room
with
its
furniture
its
antimacassars
of
the
early
victorian
era
its
wax
flowers
under
their
glass
dome
and
its
covered
with
a
cloth
it
was
all
so
very
dispiriting
the
primness
of
the
whatnot
decorated
with
pieces
of
treasured
china
the
big
overmantel
and
the
old
filled
with
all
spoke
mutely
of
the
old
spinster
to
whom
the
veriest
speck
of
dust
was
an
abomination
sighing
still
again
the
girl
turned
once
more
to
the
instrument
with
its
faded
crimson
silk
behind
the
walnut
fretwork
and
playing
the
plaintive
melody
sang
an
ancient
serenade
di
questo
cor
tu
ferito
il
core
a
cento
colpi
piu
non
val
mentire
pensa
che
non
sopporto
piu
il
dolore
e
se
segu
cosi
vado
a
morire
ti
tengo
nella
mente
a
tutte
se
lavoro
se
velio
o
sto
a
dormre
e
mentre
dormo
ancora
un
sonno
grato
mi
trovo
tutto
lacrime
bagnato
while
she
sang
there
was
a
rap
at
the
and
just
as
she
concluded
the
prim
maid
entered
with
a
letter
upon
a
salver
in
an
instant
her
heart
gave
a
bound
she
recognised
the
handwriting
it
was
walter
the
moment
the
girl
had
left
the
room
she
tore
open
the
envelope
and
holding
her
breath
read
what
was
written
within
the
words
were
dearest
heart
your
letter
came
to
me
after
several
wanderings
it
has
caused
me
to
think
and
to
wonder
if
after
all
i
may
be
mistaken
if
after
all
i
have
misjudged
you
darling
i
gave
you
my
heart
it
is
true
but
you
spurned
it
under
compulsion
you
say
why
under
compulsion
who
is
it
who
compels
you
to
act
against
your
will
and
against
your
better
nature
i
know
that
you
love
me
as
well
and
as
truly
as
i
love
you
yourself
i
long
to
see
you
with
just
as
great
a
longing
you
are
mine
mine
my
own
and
being
mine
you
must
tell
me
the
truth
i
forgive
you
forgive
you
everything
but
i
can
not
understand
what
flockart
means
by
saying
that
i
have
spoken
of
you
i
have
not
seen
the
man
nor
do
i
wish
to
see
him
gabrielle
do
not
trust
him
he
is
your
enemy
as
he
is
mine
he
has
lied
to
you
as
grim
circumstance
has
forced
you
to
treat
me
cruelly
let
us
hope
that
smiling
fortune
will
be
ours
at
last
the
world
is
very
small
i
have
just
met
my
old
friend
edgar
hamilton
who
was
at
college
with
me
and
who
i
find
is
secretary
to
some
wealthy
foreigner
a
certain
baron
de
hetzendorf
i
have
not
seen
him
for
years
and
yet
he
turns
up
here
merry
and
prosperous
after
struggling
for
a
long
time
with
adverse
circumstances
but
gabrielle
your
letter
has
puzzled
and
alarmed
me
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
mystifying
it
all
becomes
i
must
see
you
and
you
must
tell
me
the
truth
the
whole
truth
we
love
each
other
dear
heart
and
no
one
shall
force
you
to
lie
again
to
me
as
you
did
in
that
letter
you
wrote
from
glencardine
you
wish
to
see
me
darling
you
shall
and
you
shall
tell
me
the
truth
my
dear
love
until
we
meet
which
i
hope
may
be
almost
as
soon
as
you
receive
this
my
love
my
sweetheart
i
am
your
own
walter
she
sat
staring
at
the
letter
he
demanded
an
explanation
he
intended
to
come
there
and
demand
it
and
the
explanation
was
one
which
she
dared
not
give
rather
that
she
took
her
own
life
than
tell
him
the
ghastly
circumstances
he
had
met
an
old
chum
named
hamilton
was
this
the
hamilton
who
had
snatched
her
from
that
deadly
peril
the
name
of
hetzendorf
sounded
to
be
austrian
or
german
how
strange
if
hamilton
her
rescuer
were
the
same
man
who
had
been
years
ago
her
lover
college
friend
she
passed
her
white
hand
across
her
brow
trying
to
collect
her
senses
she
had
longed
ah
with
such
an
intense
longing
for
a
response
to
that
letter
of
hers
and
here
at
last
it
had
come
but
what
a
response
he
intended
her
to
make
confession
he
demanded
to
know
the
actual
truth
what
could
she
do
how
should
she
act
holding
the
letter
in
her
hand
she
glanced
around
the
little
room
in
utter
despair
he
loved
her
his
words
of
reassurance
brought
her
great
comfort
but
he
wished
to
know
the
truth
he
suspected
something
by
her
own
action
in
writing
those
letters
she
had
aroused
suspicion
against
herself
she
regretted
yet
what
was
the
use
of
regret
her
own
passionate
words
had
revealed
to
him
something
which
he
had
not
suspected
and
he
was
coming
down
there
to
woodnewton
to
demand
the
truth
he
might
even
then
be
on
his
way
if
he
asked
her
what
could
she
reply
she
dare
not
tell
him
the
truth
there
were
now
but
two
roads
open
either
death
by
her
own
hand
or
to
lie
to
him
could
she
tell
him
an
untruth
no
she
loved
him
therefore
she
could
not
resort
to
false
declarations
and
deceit
better
far
better
would
it
be
that
she
took
her
own
life
better
she
thought
if
hamilton
had
not
plunged
into
the
river
after
her
if
her
life
had
ended
walter
murie
would
at
least
have
been
spared
the
bitter
knowledge
of
a
disgraceful
truth
her
face
grew
pale
and
her
mouth
hardened
at
the
thought
she
loved
him
with
all
the
fierce
passion
of
her
young
heart
he
was
her
hero
her
idol
before
her
eyes
his
dear
serious
face
rose
a
sweet
memory
of
what
had
been
tender
remembrances
of
his
fond
kisses
still
lingered
with
her
she
recollected
how
around
her
waist
his
strong
arm
would
steal
and
how
slowly
and
yet
irresistibly
he
would
draw
her
in
his
arms
in
silent
ecstasy
alas
that
was
all
past
and
over
they
loved
each
other
but
she
was
now
face
to
face
with
what
she
had
so
long
dreaded
face
to
face
with
the
inevitable
she
must
either
confess
the
truth
and
by
so
doing
turn
his
love
to
hatred
or
else
remain
silent
and
face
the
end
she
reread
the
letter
still
seated
at
the
piano
her
elbows
resting
inertly
upon
the
keys
then
she
lifted
her
pale
face
again
to
the
window
gazing
out
blankly
upon
the
village
street
so
dull
so
silent
so
uninteresting
the
thought
of
hamilton
the
man
who
held
a
secret
of
hers
and
who
only
a
few
hours
before
had
rescued
her
from
the
peril
in
which
felix
krail
had
placed
her
again
recurred
to
her
was
it
not
remarkable
that
he
walter
old
friend
should
come
down
into
that
neighbourhood
there
was
some
motive
in
his
visit
what
could
it
be
he
had
spoken
of
hungary
a
country
which
had
always
possessed
for
her
a
strange
fascination
was
it
not
quite
likely
that
being
friend
hamilton
on
his
return
to
london
would
relate
the
exciting
incident
of
the
river
had
he
seen
krail
and
if
so
did
he
know
him
those
two
points
caused
her
the
greatest
apprehension
suppose
he
had
recognised
krail
suppose
he
had
overheard
that
man
demands
and
her
defiant
refusal
he
would
surely
tell
walter
she
bit
her
lip
and
her
white
fingers
clenched
themselves
in
desperation
why
should
all
this
misfortune
fall
upon
her
to
wreck
her
young
life
other
girls
were
gay
careless
and
happy
they
visited
and
motored
and
flirted
and
danced
and
went
to
theatres
in
town
and
to
suppers
afterwards
at
the
carlton
or
savoy
and
had
what
they
termed
a
ripping
good
time
but
to
her
poor
little
self
all
pleasure
was
debarred
only
the
grim
shadows
of
life
were
hers
her
mind
had
become
filled
with
despair
why
had
this
great
calamity
befallen
her
why
had
she
by
her
own
action
in
writing
to
her
lover
placed
herself
in
that
terrible
position
from
which
there
was
no
escape
save
by
death
the
recollection
of
the
whispers
those
fatal
whispers
of
glencardine
flashed
through
her
distressed
mind
was
it
actually
true
as
the
countryfolk
declared
that
death
overtook
all
those
who
overheard
the
counsels
of
the
evil
one
it
really
seemed
as
though
there
actually
was
more
in
the
weird
belief
than
she
had
acknowledged
her
father
had
scouted
the
idea
yet
old
stewart
who
had
personally
known
instances
had
declared
that
evil
and
disaster
fell
inevitably
upon
any
one
who
chanced
to
hear
those
voices
of
the
night
the
recollection
of
that
moonlight
hour
among
the
ruins
and
the
distinct
voices
whispering
caused
a
shudder
to
run
through
her
she
had
heard
them
with
her
own
ears
and
ever
since
that
moment
nothing
but
catastrophe
upon
catastrophe
had
fallen
upon
her
yes
she
had
heard
the
whispers
and
she
could
not
escape
their
evil
influence
any
more
than
those
other
unfortunate
persons
to
whom
death
had
come
so
unexpectedly
and
swiftly
a
shadow
passed
the
window
causing
her
to
start
the
figure
was
that
of
a
man
she
rose
from
the
piano
with
a
cry
and
stood
erect
motionless

chapter
xxxiii
is
about
the
maison
l√©nard
the
big
rather
severely
but
room
overlooked
the
busy
boulevard
des
capucines
in
paris
in
front
lay
the
great
white
fa√ßade
of
the
grand
hotel
below
was
all
the
bustle
life
and
movement
of
paris
on
a
bright
sunny
afternoon
within
the
room
at
a
large
mahogany
table
sat
four
men
while
a
fifth
stood
at
one
of
the
long
windows
his
back
turned
to
his
companions
the
short
man
looking
forth
into
the
street
in
expectancy
was
monsieur
goslin
he
had
been
speaking
and
his
words
had
evidently
caused
some
surprise
even
alarm
among
his
companions
for
they
now
exchanged
glances
in
silence
three
of
the
men
were
and
while
the
fourth
a
shrivelled
old
fellow
in
faded
clothes
which
seemed
several
sizes
too
large
for
him
looked
needy
and
as
he
nervously
chafed
his
thin
bony
hands
next
moment
they
all
began
chatting
in
french
though
from
their
countenances
it
was
plain
that
they
were
of
various
nationalities
one
being
german
the
other
italian
and
the
third
a
man
had
the
appearance
of
a
levantine
goslin
alone
remained
silent
and
watchful
from
where
he
stood
he
could
see
the
people
entering
and
leaving
the
grand
hotel
he
glanced
impatiently
at
his
watch
and
then
paced
the
room
his
hand
thoughtfully
stroking
his
grey
beard
only
half
an
hour
before
he
had
alighted
at
the
gare
du
nord
coming
direct
from
glencardine
and
had
driven
there
in
an
to
keep
an
appointment
made
by
telegram
as
he
paced
the
big
room
with
its
walls
its
turkey
carpet
and
sombre
furniture
his
companions
regarded
him
in
wonder
they
instinctively
knew
that
he
had
some
news
of
importance
to
impart
there
was
one
absentee
until
his
arrival
goslin
refused
to
say
anything
the
youngest
of
the
four
assembled
at
the
table
was
the
italian
a
rather
thin
man
of
refined
appearance
mia
he
cried
raising
his
face
to
the
frenchman
why
what
has
happened
this
is
unusual
besides
why
should
we
wait
i
only
just
arrived
from
turin
and
have
had
time
to
go
to
the
hotel
let
us
get
on
not
until
he
is
present
answered
goslin
speaking
earnestly
in
french
i
have
a
statement
to
make
from
sir
henry
but
i
am
not
permitted
to
make
it
until
all
are
here
then
glancing
at
his
watch
he
added
his
train
was
due
at
est
station
at
he
ought
to
be
here
at
any
moment
the
shabby
old
man
by
birth
a
pole
still
sat
chafing
his
chilly
fingers
none
who
saw
antoine
volkonski
as
he
shuffled
along
the
street
ever
dreamed
that
he
was
head
of
the
great
financial
house
of
volkonski
fr√®res
of
petersburg
whose
huge
loans
to
the
russian
government
during
the
war
with
japan
created
a
sensation
throughout
europe
and
surely
no
casual
observer
looking
at
that
little
assembly
would
ever
entertain
suspicion
that
between
them
they
could
practically
dictate
to
the
of
europe
the
italian
seated
next
to
him
was
the
commendatore
rudolphe
cusani
head
of
the
wealthy
banking
firm
of
montemartini
of
rome
which
ranked
next
to
the
bank
of
italy
of
the
remaining
two
one
was
a
greek
from
smyrna
and
the
other
a
rather
man
with
longish
grey
hair
josef
frohnmeyer
of
hamburg
a
name
also
to
conjure
with
in
the
financial
world
the
impatient
italian
was
urging
goslin
to
explain
why
the
meeting
had
been
so
hastily
summoned
when
without
warning
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
distinguished
man
with
carefully
trained
grey
moustache
and
wearing
a
heavy
travelling
ulster
entered
ah
my
dear
baron
cried
the
italian
jumping
from
his
chair
and
taking
the
hand
we
were
waiting
for
you
and
he
drew
a
chair
next
to
his
the
man
addressed
tossed
his
soft
felt
travelling
hat
aside
saying
the
reached
me
at
a
country
house
outside
vienna
where
i
was
visiting
but
i
came
instantly
and
he
seated
himself
while
the
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
was
taken
by
the
stout
frenchman
messieurs
goslin
commenced
and
speaking
in
french
began
apologising
at
being
compelled
to
call
them
together
so
soon
after
their
last
meeting
the
matter
however
is
of
such
urgency
he
went
on
that
this
conference
is
absolutely
necessary
i
am
here
in
sir
place
with
a
statement
from
him
an
alarming
statement
our
enemies
have
unfortunately
triumphed
what
do
you
mean
cried
the
italian
starting
to
his
feet
simply
this
poor
sir
henry
has
been
the
victim
of
those
papers
which
you
my
dear
volkonski
brought
to
me
in
secret
at
glencardine
a
month
ago
have
been
stolen
stolen
gasped
the
shabby
old
man
his
grey
eyes
starting
from
his
head
stolen
think
what
that
means
to
us
to
me
to
my
house
they
will
be
sold
to
the
ministry
of
finance
in
petersburg
and
i
shall
be
ruined
ruined
not
only
you
will
be
ruined
remarked
the
man
from
hamburg
but
our
control
of
the
market
will
be
at
an
end
and
together
we
lose
over
three
million
roubles
said
goslin
in
as
quiet
a
voice
as
he
could
assume
the
six
men
those
men
who
dealt
in
millions
men
whose
names
every
one
of
them
were
as
household
words
on
the
various
bourses
of
europe
and
in
banking
circles
men
who
lent
money
to
reigning
sovereigns
and
to
states
whose
interests
were
and
whose
influences
were
greater
than
those
of
kings
and
ministers
looked
at
each
other
in
blank
despair
we
have
to
face
this
fact
as
sir
henry
points
out
to
you
that
at
petersburg
the
department
of
finance
has
no
love
for
us
we
put
on
the
screw
a
little
too
heavily
when
we
sold
them
secretly
those
three
argentine
cruisers
we
made
a
mistake
in
not
being
content
with
smaller
profit
yes
if
it
had
been
a
genuinely
honest
deal
on
their
side
remarked
the
italian
but
it
was
not
in
russia
the
crowd
made
quite
as
great
a
profit
as
we
did
and
all
three
ships
were
sent
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
four
months
afterwards
added
frohnmeyer
with
a
grim
laugh
that
is
the
question
goslin
said
what
we
have
now
to
face
is
the
peril
of
exposure
no
one
can
of
course
allege
that
we
have
ever
resorted
to
any
sharper
practices
than
those
of
other
financial
groups
but
the
fact
of
our
alliance
and
our
impregnable
strength
will
when
it
is
known
arouse
the
fiercest
antagonism
in
certain
circles
no
one
suspects
the
secret
of
our
alliance
the
italian
ejaculated
it
must
be
kept
kept
at
all
hazards
each
man
seated
there
knew
that
exposure
of
the
tactics
by
which
they
were
ruling
the
bourse
would
mean
the
sudden
end
of
their
great
prosperity
but
this
is
not
the
first
occasion
that
documents
have
been
stolen
from
sir
henry
at
glencardine
remarked
the
baron
conrad
de
hetzendorf
i
remember
the
last
time
i
went
there
to
see
him
he
explained
how
he
had
discovered
his
daughter
with
the
safe
open
and
some
of
the
papers
actually
in
her
hands
unfortunately
that
is
so
goslin
answered
there
is
every
evidence
that
we
owe
our
present
peril
to
her
initiative
she
and
her
father
are
on
bad
terms
and
it
seems
more
than
probable
that
though
she
is
no
longer
at
glencardine
she
has
somehow
contrived
to
get
hold
of
the
documents
in
question
at
the
instigation
of
her
lover
we
believe
how
do
you
know
that
the
documents
are
stolen
the
baron
asked
because
three
days
ago
sir
henry
received
an
anonymous
letter
bearing
the
postmark
of
enclosing
correct
copies
of
the
papers
which
our
friend
volkonski
brought
from
petersburg
and
asking
what
sum
he
was
prepared
to
pay
to
obtain
repossession
of
the
originals
on
receipt
of
the
letter
continued
goslin
i
rushed
to
the
safe
to
find
the
papers
gone
the
door
had
been
unlocked
and
relocked
by
an
unknown
hand
and
how
does
suspicion
attach
to
the
girl
lover
asked
the
man
from
hamburg
well
he
was
alone
in
the
library
for
half
an
hour
about
five
days
before
he
called
to
see
sir
henry
while
he
and
i
were
out
walking
together
in
the
park
it
is
believed
that
the
girl
has
a
key
to
the
safe
which
she
handed
to
her
lover
in
order
that
he
might
secure
the
papers
and
sell
them
in
russia
but
young
murie
is
the
son
of
a
wealthy
man
i
heard
observed
the
baron
certainly
but
at
present
his
allowance
is
small
was
goslin
reply
well
what
to
be
done
inquired
the
italian
done
echoed
goslin
nothing
can
be
done
why
they
all
asked
almost
in
one
breath
because
sir
henry
has
replied
refusing
to
treat
for
the
return
of
the
papers
was
that
not
injudicious
why
did
he
not
allow
us
to
discuss
the
affair
first
argued
the
levantine
because
an
immediate
answer
by
telegraph
to
a
in
hampshire
was
demanded
goslin
replied
remember
that
to
sir
henry
remarkable
foresight
all
our
prosperity
has
been
due
surely
we
may
trust
in
his
judicious
treatment
of
the
thief
that
all
very
well
protested
volkonski
but
my
fortune
is
at
stake
if
the
ministry
obtains
those
letters
they
will
crush
and
ruin
me
sir
henry
is
no
novice
remarked
the
baron
he
fights
an
enemy
with
his
own
weapons
remember
that
greek
deal
of
which
the
girl
gained
knowledge
he
actually
prepared
bogus
contracts
and
correspondence
for
the
thief
to
steal
they
were
stolen
and
passing
through
a
dozen
hands
were
at
last
offered
in
athens
the
ministry
there
laughed
at
the
thieves
for
their
pains
let
us
hope
the
same
result
will
be
now
obtained
i
fear
not
goslin
said
quietly
the
documents
stolen
on
the
former
occasion
were
worthless
the
ones
now
in
the
hands
of
our
enemies
are
genuine
but
said
the
baron
you
goslin
went
to
live
at
glencardine
on
purpose
to
protect
our
poor
blind
friend
from
his
enemies
i
know
said
the
man
addressed
i
did
my
best
and
failed
the
footman
hill
knowing
young
murie
as
a
frequent
guest
at
glencardine
the
other
day
showed
him
into
the
library
and
left
him
there
alone
it
was
then
no
doubt
that
he
opened
the
safe
with
a
false
key
and
secured
the
documents
then
why
not
apply
for
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
suggested
the
commendatore
cusani
surely
your
english
laws
do
not
allow
thieves
to
go
unpunished
in
italy
we
should
quickly
lay
hands
on
them
but
we
have
no
evidence
you
have
no
suspicion
that
any
other
man
may
have
committed
the
theft
that
fellow
flockart
for
instance
i
do
like
him
added
the
baron
he
is
altogether
too
friendly
with
everybody
at
glencardine
i
have
already
made
full
inquiries
flockart
was
in
rome
he
only
returned
to
london
the
day
before
yesterday
no
everything
points
to
the
girl
taking
revenge
upon
her
father
who
i
am
compelled
to
admit
has
treated
her
with
rather
undue
harshness
personally
i
consider
mademoiselle
very
charming
and
intelligent
they
all
admitted
that
her
correspondence
and
replies
to
reports
were
marvels
of
clear
concise
instruction
every
man
among
them
knew
well
her
neat
round
handwriting
yet
only
goslin
had
ever
seen
her
the
frenchman
was
asked
to
describe
both
the
girl
and
her
lover
this
he
did
declaring
that
gabrielle
and
walter
were
a
very
handsome
pair
whatever
may
be
said
remarked
old
volkonski
the
girl
was
a
most
excellent
assistant
to
sir
henry
but
it
is
of
course
the
old
story
a
young
girl
head
turned
by
a
handsome
lover
yet
surely
the
youth
is
not
so
poor
that
he
became
a
thief
of
necessity
to
me
it
seems
rather
as
though
he
stole
the
documents
at
her
instigation
that
is
exactly
sir
henry
belief
goslin
remarked
with
a
sigh
the
poor
old
fellow
is
beside
himself
with
grief
and
fear
no
wonder
remarked
the
italian
none
of
us
would
care
to
be
betrayed
by
our
own
daughters
but
can
not
a
trap
be
laid
to
secure
the
thief
before
he
approaches
the
people
in
russia
suggested
the
crafty
levantine
yes
yes
cried
volkonski
his
hands
still
clenched
the
ministry
would
give
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
for
them
because
by
their
aid
they
could
crush
me
crush
you
all
remember
there
are
names
there
names
of
some
of
the
most
prominent
officials
in
the
empire
think
of
the
power
of
the
ministry
if
they
held
that
list
in
their
hands
no
said
the
baron
in
a
clear
distinct
voice
his
grey
eyes
fixed
thoughtfully
upon
the
wall
opposite
rather
think
of
our
positions
of
the
exultation
of
our
enemies
if
this
great
combine
of
ours
were
exposed
and
broken
myself
i
consider
it
folly
that
we
have
met
here
openly
this
is
the
first
time
we
have
all
met
save
in
secret
and
how
do
we
know
but
some
spy
may
be
on
the
outside
noting
who
has
entered
here
diavoli
gasped
cusani
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
and
sinking
back
into
his
chair
i
recollect
i
passed
outside
here
a
man
i
know
a
man
who
knows
me
he
was
standing
on
the
kerb
he
saw
me
his
name
is
krail
felix
krail
is
he
still
there
cried
the
men
as
with
one
accord
they
left
their
chairs
and
dashed
eagerly
across
to
the
window
krail
cried
the
russian
in
alarm
where
is
he
see
the
italian
pointed
out
see
the
man
in
black
yonder
standing
there
near
the
smoking
a
cigarette
he
is
still
watching
he
has
seen
us
meet
here
ah
said
the
baron
in
a
hoarse
voice
i
said
so
to
meet
openly
like
this
was
far
too
great
a
risk
nobody
knew
anything
of
l√©nard
et
morellet
of
the
boulevard
des
capucines
except
that
they
were
unimportant
financiers
the
world
will
know
who
they
really
are
messieurs
we
are
the
victims
of
a
very
clever
ruse
we
have
been
so
tricked
that
we
have
been
actually
summoned
here
and
our
identity
disclosed
the
five
monarchs
of
finance
stood
staring
at
each
other
in
absolute
silence
chapter
xxxiv
surprises
flockart
well
you
and
your
friend
felix
have
placed
me
in
a
very
pleasant
position
have
you
asked
lady
heyburn
of
flockart
who
had
just
entered
the
at
park
street
i
hope
now
that
you
satisfied
with
your
blunder
the
man
addressed
in
a
suit
of
grey
a
fancy
vest
and
boots
still
carrying
his
hat
and
stick
in
his
hand
turned
to
her
in
surprise
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
i
arrived
from
paris
at
five
this
morning
and
i
brought
you
good
news
nonsense
cried
the
woman
starting
from
her
chair
in
anger
you
ca
deceive
me
any
longer
krail
has
discovered
the
whole
game
the
syndicate
held
a
meeting
at
the
office
in
paris
he
and
i
watched
the
arrivals
we
now
know
who
they
are
and
exactly
what
they
are
doing
by
jove
we
never
dreamed
that
your
husband
blind
though
he
is
is
head
of
such
a
smart
and
influential
group
why
they
the
first
in
europe
what
does
that
matter
krail
wants
money
so
do
we
but
even
with
all
your
wonderful
schemes
we
get
none
wait
my
dear
winnie
remain
patient
and
we
shall
obtain
plenty
it
was
indeed
strange
for
a
woman
within
that
smart
and
with
her
electric
brougham
at
the
door
to
complain
of
poverty
the
house
had
been
a
centre
of
political
activity
in
the
days
before
sir
henry
met
with
that
terrible
affliction
the
room
in
which
the
pair
stood
had
been
the
scene
of
many
a
private
and
momentous
conference
and
in
the
big
upstairs
many
a
cabinet
minister
had
bent
over
the
hand
of
the
fair
lady
heyburn
into
the
newly
decorated
room
with
its
original
adams
ceiling
its
panelling
and
antique
overmantel
shone
the
morning
sun
weak
and
yellow
as
it
always
is
in
london
in
the
lady
heyburn
dressed
in
a
smart
of
grey
pushed
her
fluffy
fair
hair
from
her
brow
while
upon
her
face
was
an
expression
which
told
of
combined
fear
and
anger
her
visitor
was
surprised
after
that
watchful
afternoon
in
the
boulevard
des
capucines
he
had
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
caf√©
terminus
listening
to
krail
who
rubbed
his
hands
with
delight
and
declared
that
he
now
held
the
most
powerful
group
in
europe
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
for
the
past
six
years
or
so
gigantic
had
been
secured
by
that
unassuming
and
apparently
financial
house
of
l√©nard
et
morellet
from
a
struggling
firm
they
had
within
a
year
grown
into
one
whose
wealth
seemed
inexhaustible
and
whose
balances
at
the
credit
lyonnais
the
soci√©t√©
g√©n√©rale
and
the
comptoir
were
possibly
the
largest
of
any
of
the
customers
of
those
great
corporations
the
financial
world
of
europe
had
wondered
it
was
a
mystery
who
was
behind
l√©nard
et
morellet
the
pair
of
highly
respectable
business
men
who
lived
in
unostentatious
comfort
the
former
at
enghien
just
outside
paris
and
the
latter
out
in
the
country
at
melum
the
mystery
was
so
well
and
so
carefully
preserved
that
not
even
the
bankers
themselves
could
obtain
knowledge
of
the
truth
krail
had
however
after
nearly
two
years
of
clever
watching
and
ingenious
subterfuge
succeeded
by
placing
the
group
in
a
hole
in
calling
them
together
that
they
met
and
often
was
undoubted
but
where
they
met
and
how
was
still
a
complete
mystery
as
flockart
had
sat
that
previous
afternoon
listening
to
unscrupulous
and
proposals
he
had
remained
in
silent
wonder
at
the
man
audacious
attitude
nothing
deterred
him
nothing
daunted
him
flockart
had
returned
that
night
from
paris
gone
to
his
chambers
in
street
breakfasted
dressed
and
had
now
called
upon
her
ladyship
in
order
to
impart
to
her
the
good
news
yet
instead
of
welcoming
him
she
only
treated
him
with
resentment
and
scorn
he
knew
the
quick
flash
of
those
eyes
he
had
seen
it
before
on
other
occasions
this
was
not
the
first
time
they
had
quarrelled
yet
he
and
cunning
had
always
held
her
powerless
to
elude
him
had
always
compelled
her
to
give
him
the
sums
he
so
constantly
demanded
that
morning
however
she
was
distinctly
resentful
distinctly
defiant
for
an
instant
he
turned
from
her
biting
his
lip
in
annoyance
when
facing
her
again
he
smiled
asking
tell
me
winnie
what
does
all
this
mean
mean
echoed
the
baronet
wife
mean
how
can
you
ask
me
that
question
look
at
me
a
ruined
woman
and
you
speak
out
he
cried
what
has
happened
you
surely
know
what
has
happened
you
have
treated
me
like
the
cur
you
are
and
that
is
speaking
plainly
you
sacrificed
me
in
order
to
save
yourself
from
what
from
exposure
to
me
ruin
is
not
a
matter
of
days
but
of
hours
you
speaking
in
enigmas
i
do
understand
you
he
cried
impatiently
krail
and
i
have
at
last
been
successful
we
know
now
the
true
source
of
your
husband
huge
income
and
in
order
to
prevent
exposure
he
must
pay
and
pay
us
well
too
yes
she
laughed
hysterically
you
tell
me
all
this
after
blundered
blundered
how
he
asked
surprised
at
her
demeanour
what
the
use
of
beating
about
the
bush
asked
her
ladyship
the
girl
is
back
at
glencardine
she
knows
everything
thanks
to
your
foolish
back
at
glencardine
gasped
flockart
but
she
dare
not
speak
by
heaven
if
she
does
then
then
and
what
pray
can
you
do
inquired
the
woman
harshly
it
is
i
who
have
to
suffer
i
who
am
crushed
humiliated
ruined
while
you
and
your
precious
friend
shield
yourselves
behind
your
cloaks
of
honesty
you
are
sir
henry
friend
he
believes
you
as
such
you
and
she
laughed
the
hollow
laugh
of
a
woman
who
was
staring
death
in
the
face
she
was
haggard
and
drawn
and
her
hands
trembled
with
nervousness
which
she
strove
in
vain
to
repress
lady
heyburn
was
desperate
he
still
believes
in
me
eh
asked
the
man
thinking
deeply
for
his
clever
brain
was
already
active
to
devise
some
means
of
escape
from
what
appeared
to
be
a
distinctly
awkward
dilemma
he
had
never
calculated
the
chances
of
gabrielle
return
to
her
father
side
he
had
believed
that
impossible
i
understand
that
my
husband
will
hear
no
word
against
you
replied
the
tall
woman
but
when
i
speak
he
will
listen
depend
upon
it
you
dare
he
cried
turning
upon
her
in
threatening
attitude
you
dare
utter
a
single
word
against
me
and
by
heaven
i
tell
what
i
know
the
country
shall
ring
with
a
scandal
the
shame
of
your
attitude
towards
the
girl
and
a
crime
for
which
you
will
be
arraigned
with
me
before
an
remember
the
woman
shrank
from
him
her
face
had
blanched
she
saw
that
he
was
equally
as
determined
as
she
was
desperate
james
flockart
always
kept
his
threats
he
was
by
no
means
a
man
to
trifle
with
for
a
moment
she
was
thoughtful
then
she
laughed
defiantly
in
his
face
speak
say
what
you
will
but
if
you
do
you
suffer
with
me
you
say
that
exposure
is
imminent
he
remarked
how
did
the
girl
manage
to
return
to
glencardine
with
walter
aid
he
went
down
to
woodnewton
what
passed
between
them
i
have
no
idea
i
only
returned
the
day
before
yesterday
from
the
south
all
i
know
is
that
the
girl
is
back
with
her
father
and
that
he
knows
much
more
than
he
ought
to
know
murie
could
not
have
assisted
her
flockart
declared
decisively
the
old
man
suspects
him
of
taking
those
russian
papers
from
the
safe
how
do
you
know
he
has
cleared
himself
of
the
suspicion
he
may
have
done
the
old
man
dotes
upon
the
girl
i
know
all
that
and
she
may
have
turned
upon
you
and
told
the
truth
about
the
safe
incident
that
more
than
likely
she
dare
not
utter
a
word
you
far
too
it
is
your
failing
and
when
pray
has
it
failed
tell
me
never
until
the
present
moment
your
bluff
is
perfect
yet
there
are
moments
when
it
can
not
aid
you
depend
upon
it
she
told
me
one
night
long
ago
in
my
own
room
when
she
had
disobeyed
defied
and
annoyed
me
that
she
would
never
rest
until
sir
henry
knew
the
truth
and
that
she
would
place
before
him
proofs
of
the
other
affair
she
has
long
intended
to
do
this
and
now
thanks
to
your
attitude
of
passive
inertness
she
has
accomplished
her
intentions
what
he
gasped
in
distinct
alarm
has
she
told
her
father
the
truth
a
telegram
i
received
from
sir
henry
late
last
night
makes
it
only
too
plain
that
he
knows
something
responded
the
unhappy
woman
staring
straight
before
her
it
is
your
fault
your
fault
she
went
on
turning
suddenly
upon
her
companion
again
i
warned
you
of
the
danger
long
ago
flockart
stood
motionless
the
announcement
which
the
woman
had
made
staggered
him
felix
krail
had
come
to
him
in
paris
and
after
some
hesitation
and
with
some
reluctance
had
described
how
he
had
followed
the
girl
along
the
nene
bank
and
thrown
her
into
the
deepest
part
of
the
river
knowing
that
she
would
be
hampered
by
her
skirts
and
that
she
could
not
swim
she
will
not
trouble
us
further
never
fear
he
had
said
it
will
be
thought
a
case
of
suicide
through
love
her
mental
depression
is
the
common
talk
of
the
neighbourhood
and
yet
the
girl
was
safe
and
now
home
again
at
glencardine
he
reflected
upon
the
ugly
facts
of
the
other
affair
to
which
her
ladyship
sometimes
referred
and
his
face
went
ashen
pale
just
at
the
moment
when
success
had
come
to
them
after
all
their
ingenuity
and
all
their
endeavours
just
at
a
moment
when
they
could
demand
and
obtain
what
terms
they
liked
from
sir
henry
to
preserve
the
secret
of
the
financial
combine
came
this
catastrophe
felix
was
a
fool
to
have
left
his
work
only
he
remarked
aloud
as
though
speaking
to
himself
what
work
asked
the
woman
eagerly
but
he
did
not
satisfy
her
to
explain
would
only
increase
her
alarm
and
render
her
even
more
desperate
than
she
was
did
i
not
tell
you
often
that
from
her
we
had
all
to
fear
cried
the
woman
frantically
but
you
would
not
listen
and
now
i
am
i
face
to
face
with
the
inevitable
disaster
is
before
me
no
power
can
avert
it
the
girl
will
have
a
bitter
and
terrible
revenge
no
he
cried
quickly
with
fierce
determination
no
i
save
you
winnie
the
girl
shall
not
speak
i
go
up
to
glencardine
and
face
it
out
you
will
come
with
me
i
gasped
the
shrinking
woman
ah
no
i
i
could
i
dare
not
face
him
you
know
too
well
i
dare
not
chapter
xxxv
discloses
a
secret
the
grey
mists
were
still
hanging
upon
the
hills
of
glencardine
although
it
was
already
midday
for
it
had
rained
all
night
and
everywhere
was
damp
and
chilly
gabrielle
in
her
short
tweed
skirt
and
had
strolled
with
walter
murie
at
her
side
from
the
house
along
the
winding
path
to
the
old
castle
from
the
contented
expression
upon
her
pale
refined
countenance
it
was
plain
that
happiness
to
a
great
extent
had
been
restored
to
her
when
he
had
gone
to
woodnewton
it
was
to
fetch
her
back
to
glencardine
he
had
asked
for
an
explanation
it
was
true
but
when
she
had
refused
one
he
had
not
pressed
it
that
he
was
puzzled
sorely
puzzled
was
apparent
at
first
sir
henry
had
refused
to
receive
his
daughter
but
on
hearing
her
appealing
voice
he
had
to
some
extent
relented
and
though
strained
relations
still
existed
between
them
yet
happiness
had
come
to
her
in
the
knowledge
that
walter
affection
was
still
as
strong
as
ever
young
murie
had
of
course
heard
from
his
mother
the
story
told
by
lady
heyburn
concerning
the
offence
of
her
stepdaughter
but
he
would
not
believe
a
single
word
against
her
they
had
been
strolling
slowly
and
she
had
been
speaking
expressing
her
heartfelt
thanks
for
his
action
in
taking
her
from
that
life
of
awful
monotony
at
woodnewton
then
he
on
his
part
had
pressed
her
soft
hand
and
repeated
his
promise
of
lifelong
love
they
had
entered
the
old
courtyard
of
the
castle
when
suddenly
she
exclaimed
how
i
wish
walter
that
we
might
elucidate
the
secret
of
the
whispers
it
certainly
would
be
intensely
interesting
if
we
could
he
said
the
most
curious
thing
is
that
my
old
friend
edgar
hamilton
who
is
secretary
to
the
baron
conrad
de
hetzendorf
tells
me
that
a
similar
legend
is
current
in
connection
with
the
old
ch√¢teau
in
hungary
he
had
heard
the
whispers
himself
most
remarkable
she
exclaimed
gazing
blankly
around
at
the
ponderous
walls
about
her
my
idea
always
has
been
that
beneath
where
we
are
standing
there
must
be
a
chamber
for
most
mediaeval
castles
had
a
subterranean
dungeon
beneath
the
courtyard
ah
if
we
could
only
find
entrance
to
it
cried
the
girl
enthusiastically
shall
we
try
have
you
not
often
tried
and
failed
he
asked
laughingly
yes
but
let
search
again
she
urged
my
strong
belief
is
that
entrance
is
not
to
be
obtained
from
this
side
but
from
the
glen
down
below
yes
no
doubt
in
the
ages
long
ago
the
hill
was
much
steeper
than
it
now
is
and
there
were
no
trees
or
undergrowth
on
that
side
it
was
impregnable
the
river
however
in
receding
silted
up
much
earth
and
boulders
at
the
bend
and
has
made
the
ascent
possible
together
they
went
to
a
breach
in
the
ponderous
walls
and
peered
down
into
the
ancient
now
but
a
rippling
burn
very
well
replied
murie
let
us
descend
and
explore
so
they
retraced
their
steps
until
when
about
to
the
house
they
left
the
path
and
went
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
beautiful
glen
until
they
were
immediately
beneath
the
old
castle
the
spot
was
remote
and
seldom
visited
few
ever
came
there
for
it
was
approached
by
no
path
on
that
side
of
the
burn
so
that
the
keepers
always
passed
along
the
opposite
bank
they
had
no
necessity
to
penetrate
there
besides
it
was
too
near
the
house
through
the
bracken
and
undergrowth
passing
by
big
trees
that
in
the
ages
had
sprung
up
from
seedlings
dropped
by
the
birds
or
sown
by
the
winds
they
slowly
ascended
to
the
frowning
walls
far
above
the
walls
that
had
withstood
so
many
sieges
and
the
ravages
of
so
many
centuries
half
a
dozen
times
the
girl
skirt
became
entangled
in
the
briars
and
once
she
tore
her
cape
upon
some
thorns
but
enjoying
the
adventure
she
went
on
walter
going
first
and
clearing
a
way
for
her
as
best
he
could
nobody
has
ever
been
up
here
before
i
quite
certain
gabrielle
cried
halting
breathless
for
a
moment
old
stewart
who
says
he
knows
every
inch
of
the
estate
has
never
climbed
here
i
sure
i
do
expect
he
has
declared
her
lover
at
last
they
found
themselves
beneath
the
foundations
of
one
of
the
of
the
castle
walls
whereupon
he
suggested
that
if
they
followed
the
wall
right
along
and
examined
it
closely
they
might
discover
some
entrance
i
somehow
fear
there
will
not
be
any
door
on
the
exposed
side
he
added
the
base
of
the
walls
was
all
along
hidden
by
thick
undergrowth
therefore
the
examination
proved
extremely
difficult
nevertheless
keenly
interested
in
their
exploration
the
pair
kept
on
struggling
and
climbing
until
the
perspiration
rolled
off
both
their
faces
suddenly
walter
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
why
look
here
this
seems
like
a
track
people
been
up
here
after
all
and
his
companion
saw
that
from
the
burn
below
up
through
the
bushes
ran
a
narrow
winding
path
which
showed
little
sign
of
frequent
use
walter
went
on
before
her
quickly
following
the
path
until
it
turned
at
and
ended
before
a
low
door
of
rough
wood
which
filled
a
small
breach
in
the
wall
a
breach
made
in
all
probability
at
the
last
siege
in
the
early
seventeenth
century
this
must
lead
somewhere
cried
walter
excitedly
and
lifting
the
roughly
constructed
wooden
latch
he
pushed
the
door
open
disclosing
a
cavernous
darkness
a
dank
earthy
smell
greeted
their
nostrils
it
was
certainly
an
uncanny
place
by
jove
cried
walter
i
wonder
where
this
leads
to
and
taking
out
his
vestas
he
struck
one
and
holding
it
before
him
went
forward
passing
through
the
breach
in
the
broken
wall
into
a
stone
passage
which
led
to
the
left
for
a
few
yards
and
gave
entrance
to
exactly
what
gabrielle
had
expected
a
small
windowless
stone
chamber
probably
used
in
olden
days
as
a
dungeon
here
they
found
to
their
surprise
several
old
chairs
a
rough
table
formed
of
two
deal
planks
upon
trestles
and
a
couple
of
candles
in
candlesticks
which
gabrielle
recognised
as
belonging
to
the
house
these
were
lit
and
by
their
aid
the
place
was
thoroughly
examined
upon
the
floor
was
a
heap
of
black
tinder
where
some
papers
had
been
burnt
weeks
or
perhaps
months
ago
there
were
lying
about
showing
that
whoever
had
been
there
had
taken
his
ease
in
a
niche
was
a
small
tin
box
containing
matches
and
fresh
candles
while
in
a
corner
lay
an
old
newspaper
limp
and
damp
bearing
a
date
six
months
before
on
the
floor
too
were
a
number
of
pieces
of
paper
a
letter
torn
to
fragments
they
tried
to
piece
it
together
laying
it
upon
the
table
carefully
but
were
unsuccessful
in
discovering
its
import
save
that
it
was
in
russian
from
somebody
in
odessa
and
addressed
to
sir
henry
carrying
the
candles
in
their
hands
they
went
into
the
narrow
passage
to
explore
the
subterranean
regions
of
the
old
place
but
neither
way
could
they
proceed
far
for
the
passage
had
fallen
in
at
both
ends
and
was
blocked
by
rubbish
the
only
exit
or
entrance
was
by
that
narrow
breach
in
the
walls
so
cunningly
concealed
by
the
undergrowth
and
closed
by
the
rudely
made
door
of
planks
nailed
together
above
in
the
stone
roof
of
the
chamber
there
was
a
wide
crack
running
obliquely
and
through
which
any
sound
could
be
heard
in
the
courtyard
above
they
remained
in
the
narrow
little
cell
for
a
full
making
careful
examination
of
everything
and
discussing
the
probability
of
the
whispers
heard
in
the
courtyard
above
emanating
from
that
hidden
chamber
for
what
purpose
was
the
place
used
and
by
whom
in
all
probability
it
was
the
very
chamber
in
which
cardinal
setoun
had
been
treacherously
done
to
death
though
they
made
a
most
minute
investigation
they
discovered
nothing
further
up
to
a
certain
point
their
explorations
had
been
crowned
by
success
yet
the
discovery
rather
tended
to
increase
the
mystery
than
diminish
it
that
the
whispers
were
supernatural
gabrielle
had
all
along
refused
to
believe
the
question
was
to
what
use
that
secret
chamber
was
put
at
last
more
puzzled
than
ever
the
pair
having
extinguished
the
candles
emerged
again
into
the
light
of
day
closing
and
latching
the
little
door
after
them
then
following
the
narrow
secret
path
they
found
that
it
wound
through
the
bushes
and
emerged
by
a
circuitous
way
some
distance
along
the
glen
its
entrance
being
carefully
concealed
by
a
big
boulder
which
hid
it
from
any
one
straying
there
by
accident
so
near
was
it
to
the
house
and
so
well
concealed
that
no
keeper
had
ever
discovered
it
well
declared
gabrielle
we
certainly
made
a
most
interesting
discovery
this
morning
but
i
wonder
if
it
really
does
solve
the
mystery
of
the
whispers
scarcely
walter
admitted
we
have
yet
to
discover
to
whom
the
secret
of
the
existence
of
that
chamber
is
known
no
doubt
the
whispers
are
heard
above
through
the
crack
in
the
roof
therefore
at
present
we
had
better
keep
our
knowledge
strictly
to
ourselves
and
to
this
the
girl
of
course
agreed
they
found
sir
henry
seated
alone
in
the
sunshine
in
one
of
the
big
of
the
a
pathetic
figure
with
his
blank
bespectacled
countenance
turned
towards
the
light
and
his
fingers
busily
knitting
to
employ
the
time
which
alas
hung
so
heavily
upon
his
hands
truth
to
tell
with
flockart
influence
upon
him
he
was
not
quite
convinced
of
the
sincerity
of
either
gabrielle
or
walter
murie
therefore
when
they
entered
and
his
daughter
spoke
to
him
his
greeting
was
not
altogether
cordial
why
dear
dad
how
is
it
you
sitting
here
all
alone
i
would
have
gone
for
a
walk
with
you
had
i
known
i
expecting
goslin
was
the
old
man
snappy
reply
he
left
paris
yesterday
and
should
certainly
have
been
here
by
this
time
i
make
out
why
he
has
sent
me
a
explaining
the
delay
he
may
have
lost
his
connection
in
london
murie
suggested
perhaps
so
remarked
the
baronet
with
a
sigh
his
fingers
moving
mechanically
murie
could
see
that
he
was
unnerved
and
unlike
himself
he
of
course
was
unaware
of
the
great
interests
depending
upon
the
theft
of
those
papers
from
his
safe
but
the
old
man
was
anxious
to
hear
from
goslin
what
had
occurred
at
the
urgent
meeting
of
the
secret
syndicate
in
paris
gabrielle
was
chatting
gaily
with
her
father
in
an
endeavour
to
cheer
him
up
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
flockart
still
in
his
travelling
ulster
entered
exclaiming
sir
henry
why
my
dear
flockart
this
is
really
quite
unexpected
i
i
thought
you
were
abroad
cried
the
baronet
his
face
brightening
as
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
his
visitor
to
grasp
so
i
have
been
i
only
got
back
to
town
yesterday
morning
and
left
euston
last
night
well
said
sir
henry
i
very
glad
you
are
here
again
i
missed
you
very
much
very
much
indeed
i
hope
you
make
another
long
stay
with
us
at
glencardine
the
man
addressed
raised
his
eyes
to
gabrielle
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
defiant
and
unflinching
the
day
of
her
to
protect
her
helpless
father
honour
and
welfare
had
come
she
had
suffered
much
in
silence
suffered
as
no
other
girl
would
suffer
but
she
had
tried
to
conceal
the
bitter
truth
her
spirit
had
been
broken
she
was
obsessed
by
one
fear
one
idea
for
a
moment
the
girl
held
her
breath
walter
saw
the
sudden
change
in
her
countenance
and
wondered
then
with
a
calmness
that
was
surprising
she
turned
to
her
father
and
in
a
clear
distinct
voice
said
dad
now
that
flockart
has
returned
i
wish
to
tell
you
the
truth
concerning
him
to
warn
you
that
he
is
not
your
friend
but
your
very
worst
enemy
what
is
that
you
say
cried
the
man
accused
glaring
at
her
repeat
those
words
and
i
will
tell
the
whole
truth
about
yourself
here
before
your
lover
the
blind
man
frowned
he
hated
scenes
come
come
he
urged
please
do
not
quarrel
gabrielle
i
think
dear
your
words
are
scarcely
fair
to
our
friend
father
she
said
firmly
her
face
pale
as
death
i
repeat
them
that
man
standing
there
is
as
much
your
enemy
as
he
is
mine
flockart
laughed
satirically
then
i
will
tell
my
story
and
let
your
father
judge
whether
you
are
a
worthy
daughter
he
said
chapter
xxxvi
in
which
gabrielle
tells
a
strange
story
gabrielle
fell
back
in
fear
her
handsome
countenance
was
blanched
to
the
lips
this
man
intended
to
speak
to
tell
the
terrible
truth
and
before
her
lover
too
she
clenched
her
hands
and
summoned
all
her
courage
flockart
laughed
at
her
laughed
in
triumph
i
think
gabrielle
he
said
that
you
should
put
an
end
to
this
deceit
towards
your
poor
blind
father
what
do
you
mean
cried
walter
in
a
fury
advancing
towards
flockart
what
has
this
question
whatever
it
is
to
do
with
you
is
it
your
place
to
stand
between
father
and
daughter
yes
answered
the
other
in
cool
defiance
it
is
i
am
sir
friend
his
friend
his
enemy
you
are
not
my
father
friend
flockart
declared
the
girl
noticing
the
look
of
pain
upon
the
afflicted
old
gentleman
face
you
have
all
along
conspired
against
him
for
years
and
you
are
actually
conspiring
with
lady
heyburn
at
this
moment
you
lie
he
cried
you
say
this
in
order
to
shield
yourself
you
know
that
your
mother
and
i
are
aware
of
your
crime
and
have
always
shielded
you
crime
gasped
walter
murie
utterly
amazed
what
is
this
man
saying
dearest
but
the
girl
stood
blanched
and
rigid
her
jaw
set
unable
to
utter
a
word
let
me
tell
you
briefly
flockart
went
on
lady
heyburn
and
myself
have
been
this
girl
best
friends
but
now
i
must
speak
openly
in
defence
of
the
allegation
she
is
making
against
me
yes
speak
urged
sir
henry
speak
and
tell
me
the
truth
it
is
a
painful
truth
sir
henry
would
that
i
were
not
compelled
to
make
such
a
charge
your
daughter
deliberately
killed
a
young
girl
named
edna
bryant
she
poisoned
her
on
account
of
jealousy
impossible
cried
sir
henry
starting
up
i
i
ca
believe
it
flockart
what
are
you
saying
my
daughter
a
murderess
yes
i
repeat
my
words
and
not
only
that
but
lady
heyburn
and
myself
have
kept
her
secret
until
until
now
it
is
imperative
that
the
truth
should
be
told
to
you
let
me
speak
dad
let
me
tell
you
no
cried
the
old
man
i
will
hear
flockart
and
turning
to
his
wife
friend
he
said
hoarsely
go
on
tell
me
the
truth
the
tragedy
took
place
at
a
picnic
just
before
gabrielle
left
her
school
at
amiens
she
placed
poison
in
the
girl
wine
ah
it
was
a
terrible
revenge
i
am
innocent
cried
the
girl
in
despair
remember
the
letter
which
you
wrote
to
your
mother
concerning
her
you
told
lady
heyburn
that
you
hated
her
do
you
deny
writing
that
letter
because
if
you
do
it
is
still
in
existence
i
deny
nothing
which
i
have
done
she
answered
you
have
told
my
father
this
in
order
to
shield
yourself
you
have
endeavoured
as
the
coward
you
are
to
prejudice
me
in
his
eyes
just
as
you
compelled
me
to
lie
to
him
when
you
opened
his
safe
and
copied
certain
of
his
papers
you
opened
the
safe
he
protested
why
i
found
you
there
myself
enough
she
exclaimed
quite
coolly
i
know
the
dread
charge
against
me
i
know
too
well
the
impossibility
of
clearing
myself
especially
in
the
face
of
that
letter
i
wrote
to
lady
heyburn
but
it
was
you
and
she
who
entrapped
me
and
who
held
me
in
fear
because
of
my
inexperience
tell
us
the
truth
the
whole
truth
darling
urged
murie
standing
at
her
side
and
taking
her
hand
confidently
in
his
the
truth
she
said
in
a
strange
voice
as
though
speaking
to
herself
yes
let
me
tell
you
i
know
that
it
will
sound
extraordinary
yet
i
swear
to
you
by
the
love
you
bear
for
me
walter
that
the
words
i
am
about
to
utter
are
the
actual
truth
i
believe
you
declared
her
lover
reassuringly
which
is
more
than
anyone
else
will
interposed
flockart
with
a
sneer
but
perfectly
confident
it
was
the
hour
of
his
triumph
she
had
defied
him
and
he
therefore
intended
to
ruin
her
once
and
for
all
the
girl
was
standing
pale
and
erect
one
hand
grasping
the
back
of
a
chair
the
other
held
in
her
lover
clasp
while
her
father
had
risen
his
expressionless
face
turned
towards
them
his
hand
groping
until
it
touched
a
small
table
upon
which
stood
an
old
full
of
listen
dad
she
said
heedless
of
flockart
remark
hear
me
before
you
condemn
me
i
know
that
the
charge
made
against
me
by
this
man
is
a
terrible
one
god
alone
knows
what
i
have
suffered
these
last
two
years
how
i
have
prayed
for
deliverance
from
the
hands
of
this
man
and
his
friends
it
happened
a
few
months
before
i
left
amiens
lady
heyburn
you
recollect
rented
a
pretty
flat
in
the
rue
in
paris
she
obtained
permission
for
me
to
leave
school
and
visit
her
for
a
few
weeks
i
recollect
perfectly
remarked
her
father
in
a
low
voice
well
there
came
many
times
to
visit
us
an
american
girl
named
bryant
who
was
studying
art
and
who
lived
somewhere
off
the
boulevard
michel
as
well
as
a
frenchman
named
felix
krail
and
an
englishman
called
hamilton
hamilton
echoed
murie
was
his
name
edgar
hamilton
my
friend
yes
the
same
was
her
quiet
reply
then
she
turned
to
murie
and
said
we
all
went
about
a
great
deal
together
for
it
was
and
we
made
many
pleasant
excursions
in
the
district
edna
bryant
was
a
merry
cheerful
girl
and
i
soon
grew
to
be
very
friendly
with
her
until
one
day
lady
heyburn
when
alone
with
me
repeated
in
strict
confidence
that
the
girl
was
secretly
devoted
to
you
walter
to
me
he
cried
true
i
knew
a
miss
bryant
long
ago
but
for
the
past
three
years
or
so
have
entirely
lost
sight
of
her
lady
heyburn
told
me
that
you
were
very
fond
of
the
girl
and
this
i
confess
aroused
my
intense
jealousy
i
believed
that
the
girl
i
had
trusted
so
implicitly
was
unprincipled
and
fickle
and
that
she
was
trying
to
secure
the
man
whom
i
had
loved
ever
since
a
child
i
had
to
return
to
school
and
from
there
i
wrote
to
lady
heyburn
who
had
gone
to
dieppe
a
letter
saying
hard
things
of
the
girl
and
declaring
that
i
would
take
secret
revenge
that
i
would
kill
her
rather
than
allow
walter
to
be
taken
from
me
a
month
afterwards
i
again
returned
to
paris
that
man
standing
there
she
indicated
flockart
was
living
at
the
h√¥tel
continental
and
was
a
frequent
visitor
he
told
me
that
it
was
well
known
in
london
that
walter
admired
miss
bryant
a
declaration
that
i
admit
drove
me
with
jealousy
it
was
a
lie
declared
walter
i
never
made
love
to
the
girl
i
admired
her
that
all
well
laughed
flockart
go
on
tell
us
your
version
of
the
affair
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
she
cried
boldly
facing
him
one
day
lady
heyburn
having
arranged
a
cycling
picnic
invited
hamilton
kratil
flockart
miss
bryant
and
myself
and
we
had
a
beautiful
run
to
chantilly
a
distance
of
about
forty
kilometres
where
we
first
made
a
tour
of
the
old
ch√¢teau
and
afterwards
entered
the
cool
shady
f√¥ret
de
pontarm√©
while
the
others
went
away
to
explore
the
paths
in
the
splendid
wood
i
was
left
to
spread
the
luncheon
upon
the
ground
setting
before
each
place
a
of
red
wine
which
i
found
in
the
baskets
then
when
all
was
ready
i
called
to
them
but
there
was
no
response
they
were
all
out
of
hearing
i
left
the
spot
and
searched
for
a
full
twenty
minutes
or
so
before
i
discovered
them
first
i
found
krail
and
flockart
strolling
together
smoking
while
the
others
were
on
ahead
they
had
lost
their
way
among
the
trees
i
led
them
back
to
the
spot
where
luncheon
was
prepared
and
all
of
us
being
hungry
we
quickly
sat
down
chatting
and
laughing
merrily
of
a
sudden
miss
bryant
stared
straight
before
her
dropped
her
glass
and
threw
up
her
arms
why
ah
my
throat
she
shrieked
i
poisoned
in
an
instant
all
was
confusion
the
poor
girl
could
not
breathe
she
tore
at
her
throat
while
her
face
became
convulsed
we
obtained
water
for
her
but
it
was
useless
for
within
five
minutes
she
was
stretched
rigid
upon
the
grass
unconscious
and
a
few
moments
later
she
was
still
quite
dead
ah
shall
i
ever
forget
the
scene
the
effect
produced
upon
us
was
appalling
all
was
so
sudden
so
tragic
so
horrible
lady
heyburn
was
the
first
to
speak
she
said
have
you
done
you
have
carried
out
the
secret
revenge
which
in
your
letter
you
threatened
i
saw
myself
trapped
those
people
had
some
motive
in
killing
the
girl
and
placing
this
crime
upon
myself
i
could
not
speak
for
i
was
too
utterly
dumfounded
the
fiends
ejaculated
walter
fiercely
then
followed
a
hurried
consultation
in
which
krail
showed
himself
most
solicitous
on
my
behalf
the
girl
went
on
aided
by
flockart
i
think
he
scraped
away
a
hole
in
a
pit
full
of
dead
leaves
and
there
the
body
must
have
been
concealed
just
as
it
was
to
me
they
all
took
a
solemn
vow
to
keep
what
they
declared
to
be
my
secret
the
bottle
containing
the
wine
from
which
the
poor
american
girl
had
drunk
was
broken
and
hidden
the
plates
and
food
swiftly
packed
up
and
we
at
once
fled
from
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
with
krail
wheeling
the
empty
cycle
we
reached
the
high
road
where
we
all
mounted
and
rode
back
in
silence
to
paris
ah
shall
i
ever
rid
myself
of
the
memory
of
that
fatal
afternoon
she
cried
as
she
paused
for
breath
fearing
that
he
might
be
noticed
taking
along
the
empty
cycle
krail
threw
it
into
the
river
near
valmondois
she
went
on
arrived
back
at
the
rue
i
protested
that
nothing
had
been
introduced
into
the
wine
but
they
declared
that
owing
to
my
youth
and
the
terrible
scandal
it
would
cause
if
i
were
arrested
they
would
never
allow
the
matter
to
pass
their
lips
hamilton
indeed
making
the
extraordinary
declaration
that
such
a
crime
had
extenuating
circumstances
when
love
was
at
stake
i
then
saw
that
i
had
fallen
the
victim
of
some
clever
conspiracy
but
so
utterly
overcome
was
i
by
the
awful
scene
that
i
could
make
but
faint
protest
ah
think
of
my
horrible
position
accused
of
a
crime
of
which
i
was
entirely
innocent
the
days
slipped
on
and
i
was
sent
back
to
amiens
and
in
due
course
came
home
here
to
dear
old
glencardine
from
that
day
i
have
lived
in
constant
fear
until
on
the
night
of
the
ball
at
connachan
you
remember
the
evening
dad
on
that
night
flockart
returned
in
secret
beckoned
me
out
upon
the
lawn
and
showed
me
something
which
held
me
petrified
in
fear
it
was
a
cutting
from
an
edinburgh
paper
that
evening
reporting
that
two
of
the
at
pontarm√©
had
discovered
the
body
of
the
missing
miss
bryant
and
that
the
french
police
were
making
active
inquiries
he
threatened
you
asked
walter
he
told
me
to
remain
quiet
and
that
he
and
lady
heyburn
would
do
their
best
to
shield
me
for
that
reason
dad
she
went
on
turning
to
the
blind
man
for
that
reason
i
feared
to
denounce
him
when
i
discovered
him
with
your
safe
open
for
that
reason
i
was
compelled
to
take
all
the
blame
and
all
your
anger
upon
myself
the
old
man
brow
knit
where
is
my
wife
he
asked
i
must
speak
to
her
before
we
go
further
this
is
a
very
serious
matter
lady
heyburn
is
still
at
park
street
flockart
replied
i
will
hear
no
more
declared
the
blind
baronet
holding
up
his
hand
not
another
word
until
my
wife
is
present
chapter
xxxvii
increases
the
interest
but
dad
cried
gabrielle
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
can
not
you
believe
me
your
daughter
before
this
man
who
is
your
enemy
because
of
my
affliction
i
am
it
seems
deceived
by
every
one
was
his
hard
response
to
where
they
stood
had
come
the
sound
of
wheels
upon
the
gravelled
drive
outside
and
a
moment
later
hill
entered
announcing
a
gentleman
to
see
you
very
urgently
sir
henry
he
is
from
baron
de
hetzendorf
from
the
baron
gasped
the
blind
man
i
see
him
later
why
it
may
be
hamilton
cried
murie
who
looking
through
the
door
saw
his
old
friend
in
the
corridor
and
quickly
called
him
in
as
he
faced
flockart
he
drew
himself
up
the
attitude
of
them
all
made
it
apparent
to
him
that
something
unusual
was
in
progress
you
arrived
at
a
very
opportune
moment
hamilton
murie
said
you
have
met
miss
heyburn
before
and
also
flockart
i
believe
at
lady
heyburn
in
paris
yes
but
sir
henry
walter
said
in
a
quiet
tone
this
gentleman
sent
by
the
baron
is
his
secretary
the
same
edgar
hamilton
of
whom
gabrielle
has
just
been
speaking
ah
then
perhaps
he
can
furnish
us
with
further
facts
regarding
this
most
extraordinary
statement
of
my
daughter
the
blind
man
exclaimed
gabrielle
has
just
told
her
father
the
truth
regarding
a
certain
tragic
occurrence
in
the
forest
of
pontarm√©
explain
to
us
all
you
know
edgar
what
i
know
said
hamilton
is
very
quickly
told
has
miss
heyburn
mentioned
the
man
krail
yes
i
have
told
them
about
him
the
girl
answered
you
have
however
perhaps
omitted
to
mention
one
or
two
small
facts
in
connection
with
the
affair
he
said
do
you
not
remember
how
on
that
eventful
afternoon
in
the
forest
when
searching
for
us
you
first
encountered
krail
walking
with
this
man
flockart
at
some
distance
from
the
others
yes
i
recollect
and
do
you
remember
that
when
we
returned
to
sit
down
to
luncheon
flockart
insisted
that
i
should
take
the
seat
which
was
afterwards
occupied
by
the
unfortunate
miss
bryant
do
you
recollect
how
i
spread
a
rug
for
her
at
that
spot
and
preferred
myself
to
stand
the
reason
of
their
invitation
to
me
to
sit
there
i
did
not
discover
until
afterwards
that
wine
had
been
prepared
for
not
for
her
for
you
the
girl
gasped
amazed
yes
the
plot
was
undoubtedly
this
there
was
no
plot
protested
flockart
interrupting
this
girl
killed
edna
bryant
through
intense
jealousy
i
repeat
that
there
was
a
foul
and
ingenious
plot
to
kill
me
and
to
entrap
miss
heyburn
hamilton
said
it
was
of
course
clear
that
miss
heyburn
was
jealous
of
the
girl
for
she
had
written
to
her
mother
making
threats
against
miss
bryant
life
therefore
the
plot
was
that
i
should
drink
the
fatal
wine
and
that
miss
gabrielle
should
be
declared
to
be
the
murderess
she
having
intended
the
wine
to
be
partaken
of
by
the
girl
she
hated
with
such
deadly
hatred
the
marked
cordiality
of
krail
and
flockart
that
i
should
take
that
seat
aroused
within
me
some
misgivings
although
i
had
never
dreamed
of
this
dastardly
and
cowardly
plot
against
me
not
until
i
saw
the
result
of
their
foul
handiwork
it
a
lie
you
are
trying
to
implicate
krail
and
myself
the
girl
is
the
only
guilty
person
she
placed
the
wine
there
she
did
not
declared
hamilton
boldly
she
was
not
there
when
the
bottle
was
changed
by
krail
but
i
was
if
what
you
say
is
true
then
you
deliberately
stood
by
and
allowed
the
girl
to
drink
i
watched
krail
go
to
the
spot
where
luncheon
was
laid
out
but
could
not
see
what
he
did
if
i
had
done
so
i
should
have
saved
the
life
you
were
a
few
yards
off
awaiting
him
therefore
you
knew
his
intentions
and
you
are
as
guilty
of
that
girl
tragic
death
as
he
what
cried
flockart
his
eyes
glaring
angrily
do
you
declare
then
that
i
am
a
murderer
you
yourself
are
the
best
judge
of
your
own
guilt
answered
hamilton
meaningly
i
deny
that
krail
or
myself
had
any
hand
in
the
affair
you
will
have
an
opportunity
of
making
that
denial
in
a
criminal
court
ere
long
remarked
the
baron
secretary
with
a
grim
smile
what
gasped
lady
heyburn
friend
his
cheeks
paling
in
an
instant
have
you
been
so
indiscreet
as
to
inform
the
police
i
have
a
week
ago
i
made
a
statement
to
hamard
of
the
s√ªret√©
in
paris
and
they
have
already
made
a
discovery
which
you
will
find
of
interest
and
somewhat
difficult
to
disprove
and
pray
what
is
that
hamilton
smiled
again
saying
no
my
dear
sir
the
police
will
tell
you
themselves
all
in
due
course
remember
you
and
your
precious
friend
plotted
to
kill
me
but
why
mr
hamilton
inquired
the
blind
man
what
was
their
motive
a
very
strong
one
was
the
reply
i
had
recognised
in
krail
a
man
who
had
defrauded
the
baron
de
hetzendorf
of
fifty
thousand
kroners
and
for
whom
the
police
were
in
active
search
both
for
that
and
for
several
other
serious
charges
of
a
similar
character
krail
knew
this
and
he
and
his
friend
this
gentleman
here
had
very
ingeniously
resolved
to
get
rid
of
me
by
making
it
appear
that
miss
gabrielle
had
poisoned
me
by
accident
a
lie
declared
flockart
fiercely
though
his
efforts
to
remain
imperturbed
were
now
palpable
you
will
be
given
due
opportunity
of
disproving
my
allegations
hamilton
said
you
coward
that
you
are
placed
the
guilt
upon
an
innocent
inexperienced
girl
why
because
with
lady
connivance
you
with
your
cunning
accomplice
krail
were
endeavouring
to
discover
sir
henry
business
secrets
in
order
first
to
operate
upon
the
valuable
financial
knowledge
you
would
thus
gain
and
so
make
a
big
and
secondly
when
you
had
done
this
it
was
your
intention
to
expose
the
methods
of
sir
henry
and
his
friends
ah
do
imagine
that
you
and
krail
have
not
been
very
well
watched
of
late
laughed
hamilton
do
you
allege
then
that
lady
heyburn
is
privy
to
all
this
asked
the
blind
man
in
distress
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
sir
was
hamilton
reply
i
know
i
know
how
i
have
been
befooled
cried
the
poor
helpless
man
befooled
because
i
am
blind
not
by
me
sir
henry
protested
flockart
by
you
and
by
every
one
else
he
cried
angrily
but
i
know
the
truth
at
last
the
truth
how
my
poor
little
daughter
has
been
used
as
an
instrument
by
you
in
your
nefarious
operations
but
hear
me
i
say
went
on
the
old
man
i
ask
my
daughter
to
forgive
me
for
misjudging
her
i
now
know
the
truth
you
obtained
by
some
means
a
false
key
to
my
safe
and
you
copied
certain
documents
which
i
had
placed
there
in
order
to
entrap
any
who
might
seek
to
learn
my
secrets
you
fell
into
that
trap
and
though
i
confess
i
thought
that
gabrielle
was
the
culprit
on
murie
behalf
i
only
lately
found
out
that
you
and
your
accomplice
krail
were
in
greece
endeavouring
to
profit
by
knowledge
obtained
from
here
my
private
house
krail
has
been
living
in
auchterarder
of
late
it
appears
hamilton
remarked
and
it
is
evidently
he
who
gaining
access
to
the
house
one
night
recently
used
his
friend
false
key
and
obtained
those
confidential
russian
documents
from
your
safe
no
doubt
declared
sir
henry
then
again
addressing
flockart
he
asked
where
are
those
documents
which
you
and
your
scoundrelly
accomplice
have
stolen
and
for
the
return
of
which
you
are
trying
to
make
me
pay
i
do
know
anything
about
them
answered
flockart
sullenly
his
face
livid
he
know
more
about
them
when
he
is
taken
off
by
the
two
detectives
from
edinburgh
who
hold
the
extradition
warrant
hamilton
remarked
with
a
grim
smile
the
fellow
started
at
those
words
his
demeanour
was
that
of
a
guilty
man
what
do
you
mean
he
gasped
white
as
death
you
you
intend
to
give
me
into
custody
if
you
do
i
warn
you
that
lady
heyburn
will
suffer
also
she
like
miss
gabrielle
has
only
been
your
tool
hamilton
declared
it
was
she
who
under
compulsion
has
furnished
you
with
means
for
years
and
whose
association
with
you
has
caused
something
little
short
of
a
scandal
times
without
number
she
has
tried
to
get
rid
of
you
and
your
evil
influence
in
this
household
but
you
have
always
defied
her
now
he
said
firmly
looking
the
other
straight
in
the
face
you
have
upon
you
those
stolen
documents
which
you
have
by
using
an
assumed
name
and
a
false
address
offered
to
sell
back
to
their
owner
sir
henry
you
have
threatened
that
if
they
are
not
purchased
at
the
exorbitant
price
you
demand
you
will
sell
them
to
the
russian
ministry
of
finance
that
is
the
way
you
treat
your
friend
and
benefactor
the
man
who
is
blind
and
helpless
come
give
them
back
to
sir
henry
and
at
once
you
must
ask
krail
stammered
the
man
now
so
cornered
that
all
further
excuse
or
denial
had
become
impossible
that
unnecessary
i
happen
to
know
that
those
papers
are
in
your
pocket
at
this
moment
a
fact
which
shows
how
watchful
an
eye
we
been
keeping
upon
you
of
late
you
have
brought
them
here
so
that
your
friend
krail
may
come
to
terms
with
sir
henry
for
their
repossession
he
arrived
from
london
with
you
and
is
at
the
arms
in
the
village
where
he
stayed
before
and
is
well
known
flockart
demanded
the
blind
man
very
seriously
you
have
papers
in
your
possession
which
are
mine
return
them
to
me
a
dead
silence
fell
all
eyes
save
those
of
sir
henry
were
turned
upon
the
man
who
until
that
moment
had
stood
so
defiant
and
so
full
of
sarcasm
but
in
an
instant
at
mention
of
krail
presence
in
auchterarder
his
demeanour
had
suddenly
changed
he
was
full
of
alarm
give
them
to
me
and
leave
my
house
sir
henry
said
holding
up
his
thin
white
hand
i
i
will
on
one
condition
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
go
we
shall
not
prevent
you
leaving
was
the
baronet
calm
reply
the
man
fumbled
nervously
in
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
and
at
last
brought
out
a
sealed
and
rather
bulgy
foolscap
envelope
open
it
gabrielle
and
see
what
is
within
her
father
said
she
obeyed
and
in
a
few
moments
explained
the
various
documents
it
contained
then
let
the
man
go
her
father
said
but
sir
henry
cried
hamilton
i
object
to
this
krail
is
down
in
the
village
forming
a
plot
to
make
you
pay
for
the
return
of
those
papers
he
arrived
from
london
by
the
same
train
as
this
man
if
we
allow
him
to
leave
he
will
inform
his
accomplice
and
both
will
escape
murie
had
his
back
to
the
door
the
long
window
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
being
closed
it
was
a
promise
of
sir
henry
declared
the
unhappy
adventurer
which
will
be
observed
when
krail
has
been
brought
face
to
face
with
sir
henry
answered
murie
at
the
same
time
calling
hill
and
one
of
the
gardeners
who
chanced
to
be
working
on
the
lawn
outside
then
with
a
firmness
which
showed
that
they
were
determined
hamilton
and
murie
conducted
flockart
to
a
small
upstairs
room
where
hill
and
the
gardener
with
the
assistance
of
stewart
who
happened
to
have
come
into
the
kitchen
mounted
guard
over
him
his
position
once
the
honoured
guest
at
glencardine
was
the
most
ignominious
conceivable
but
sir
henry
sat
in
gratification
that
at
least
he
had
got
back
those
documents
and
saved
the
reputation
of
his
friend
volkonski
as
well
as
that
of
his
chapter
xxxviii
that
man
voice
stokes
the
chauffeur
had
driven
murie
and
hamilton
in
the
car
down
to
the
village
where
the
after
a
conversation
with
the
police
inspector
went
to
the
strathavon
arms
together
with
two
constables
who
happened
to
be
off
duty
in
plain
clothes
they
found
krail
sitting
in
the
bar
calmly
smoking
awaiting
a
message
from
his
accomplice
upon
hamilton
recognition
he
was
after
a
brief
argument
arrested
on
the
charge
of
theft
from
glencardine
placed
in
the
car
between
the
two
stalwart
scotch
policemen
and
conveyed
in
triumph
to
the
castle
much
of
course
against
his
will
he
demanded
to
be
taken
straight
to
the
police
station
but
as
sir
henry
had
ordered
him
to
be
brought
to
glencardine
and
as
sir
henry
was
a
magistrate
the
inspector
was
bound
to
obey
his
orders
the
man
cruel
colourless
eyes
seemed
to
contract
closer
as
he
sat
in
the
car
with
his
enemy
hamilton
facing
him
he
had
never
dreamed
that
they
would
ever
meet
again
but
now
they
had
he
saw
that
the
game
was
up
there
was
no
hope
of
escape
he
was
being
taken
to
meet
sir
henry
heyburn
the
very
last
man
in
all
the
world
he
wished
to
face
his
sallow
countenance
was
drawn
his
lips
were
thin
and
bloodless
and
upon
his
cheeks
were
two
red
spots
which
showed
that
he
was
now
in
a
deadly
terror
gabrielle
who
had
been
weeping
at
the
knees
of
her
father
heard
the
whirr
of
the
car
coming
up
the
drive
and
springing
to
the
window
witnessed
the
arrival
of
the
party
a
moment
later
krail
between
the
two
constables
and
with
the
local
inspector
standing
respectfully
at
the
rear
stood
in
the
big
long
library
into
which
the
blind
man
was
led
by
his
daughter
when
all
had
assembled
sir
henry
in
a
clear
distinct
voice
said
i
have
had
you
arrested
and
brought
here
in
order
to
charge
you
with
stealing
certain
documents
from
my
safe
yonder
which
you
opened
by
means
of
a
duplicate
key
your
accomplice
flockart
has
given
evidence
against
you
therefore
to
deny
it
is
quite
needless
whatever
he
has
said
to
you
is
lies
the
foreigner
replied
his
accent
being
the
more
pronounced
in
his
excitement
i
know
nothing
about
it
if
you
deny
that
exclaimed
hamilton
quickly
you
will
perhaps
also
deny
that
it
was
you
who
secretly
poisoned
miss
bryant
in
the
pontarm√©
forest
even
though
i
myself
saw
you
at
the
spot
and
further
that
a
witness
has
been
found
who
actually
saw
you
substitute
the
you
intended
to
kill
me
what
ridiculous
nonsense
you
are
talking
cried
the
accused
who
was
dressed
with
his
habitual
shabby
gentility
the
girl
yonder
mademoiselle
killed
miss
bryant
then
why
did
you
make
that
deliberate
attempt
upon
my
life
at
fotheringhay
demanded
the
girl
boldly
had
it
not
been
for
hamilton
who
must
have
seen
us
together
and
guessed
that
you
intended
foul
play
i
should
certainly
have
been
drowned
he
believed
that
you
knew
his
secret
and
he
intended
both
on
his
own
behalf
and
on
flockart
also
to
close
your
lips
murie
said
with
you
out
of
the
way
their
attitude
towards
your
father
would
have
been
easier
but
with
you
still
a
living
witness
there
was
always
danger
to
them
he
thought
your
death
would
be
believed
to
be
suicide
for
he
knew
your
despondent
state
of
mind
sir
henry
stood
near
the
window
his
face
as
though
turned
to
stone
she
fell
in
was
his
lame
excuse
no
you
threw
me
in
declared
the
girl
but
i
have
feared
you
until
now
and
i
therefore
dared
not
to
give
information
against
you
ah
god
alone
knows
how
i
have
suffered
you
dare
now
eh
he
snarled
turning
quickly
upon
her
it
really
does
not
matter
what
you
deny
or
what
you
admit
hamilton
remarked
the
french
authorities
have
applied
for
your
extradition
to
france
and
this
evening
you
will
be
on
your
way
to
the
extradition
court
at
bow
street
charged
with
a
graver
offence
than
the
burglary
at
this
house
the
s√ªret√©
of
paris
make
several
interesting
allegations
against
you
or
against
felix
gerlach
which
is
your
real
name
gerlach
cried
the
blind
man
in
a
loud
voice
groping
forward
ah
he
shrieked
then
i
was
not
mistaken
when
when
i
thought
i
recognised
the
voice
that
man
voice
it
is
his
his
in
an
instant
krail
had
sprung
forward
towards
the
blind
and
defenceless
man
but
his
captors
were
fortunately
too
quick
and
prevented
him
then
at
the
inspector
orders
a
pair
of
steel
bracelets
were
quickly
placed
upon
his
wrists
gerlach
felix
gerlach
repeated
the
blind
baronet
as
though
to
himself
as
he
heard
the
snap
of
the
lock
upon
the
prisoner
wrists
the
fellow
burst
out
into
a
peal
of
harsh
discordant
laughter
he
was
endeavouring
to
retain
a
defiant
attitude
even
then
you
apparently
know
this
man
dad
gabrielle
exclaimed
in
surprise
know
him
echoed
her
father
hoarsely
know
felix
gerlach
yes
i
have
bitter
cause
to
remember
the
man
who
stands
there
before
you
accused
of
the
crime
of
murder
then
he
paused
and
drew
a
long
breath
i
unmasked
him
once
as
a
thief
and
a
swindler
and
he
swore
to
be
avenged
said
the
baronet
in
a
bitter
voice
it
was
long
ago
he
came
to
me
in
london
and
offered
me
a
concession
which
he
said
he
had
obtained
from
the
ottoman
government
for
the
construction
of
a
railroad
from
smyrna
to
the
bosphorus
the
documents
appeared
to
be
all
right
and
in
order
and
after
some
negotiations
he
sold
the
concession
to
me
and
received
ten
thousand
pounds
in
cash
of
the
in
advance
a
week
afterwards
i
discovered
that
though
the
concession
had
been
granted
by
the
minister
of
public
works
at
the
sublime
porte
it
had
been
sold
to
the
eckmann
group
in
vienna
and
that
the
papers
i
held
were
merely
copies
with
forged
signatures
and
stamps
i
applied
to
the
police
this
man
was
arrested
in
hamburg
and
brought
back
to
london
where
he
was
tried
and
a
previous
conviction
having
been
proved
against
him
sent
to
penal
servitude
for
seven
years
in
the
dock
at
the
old
bailey
he
swore
to
be
avenged
upon
me
and
upon
my
family
and
he
seems
to
have
kept
his
word
walter
remarked
when
he
came
out
of
prison
he
found
me
in
the
zenith
of
my
political
career
sir
henry
went
on
on
that
night
of
my
speech
at
the
albert
hall
i
can
only
surmise
that
he
went
there
heard
me
and
probably
became
fiercely
resentful
that
he
had
found
a
man
cleverer
than
himself
the
fact
remains
that
he
must
have
gone
in
a
cab
in
front
of
my
carriage
to
park
street
alighted
before
me
and
secreted
himself
within
the
portico
it
was
midnight
and
the
street
was
deserted
my
carriage
stopped
i
got
out
and
it
then
drove
on
to
the
mews
i
was
in
the
act
of
opening
the
door
with
my
when
by
an
unknown
hand
there
was
flung
full
into
my
eyes
some
corrosive
fluid
which
burned
terribly
and
caused
me
excruciating
pain
i
heard
a
man
exultant
voice
cry
i
promised
you
that
and
you
have
it
the
voice
i
recognised
as
that
of
the
blackguard
standing
before
you
since
that
moment
he
added
in
a
blank
hoarse
voice
i
have
been
totally
blind
you
got
me
seven
years
cried
the
foreigner
with
a
harsh
laugh
so
think
yourself
very
lucky
that
i
did
kill
you
you
placed
upon
me
an
affliction
a
perpetual
darkness
that
to
a
man
like
myself
is
almost
akin
to
death
replied
his
accuser
very
gravely
secure
from
recognition
you
wormed
yourself
into
the
confidence
of
my
wife
for
you
were
bent
upon
ruining
her
also
and
you
took
as
partner
in
your
schemes
that
needy
adventurer
flockart
i
now
see
it
all
quite
plainly
hamilton
had
recognised
you
as
gerlach
and
you
therefore
formed
a
plot
to
get
rid
of
him
and
throw
the
crime
upon
my
poor
unfortunate
daughter
even
though
she
was
scarcely
more
than
a
child
in
all
probability
lady
heyburn
in
telling
the
girl
the
story
regarding
murie
and
miss
bryant
believed
it
and
if
so
she
would
also
suspect
my
daughter
to
be
the
actual
criminal
this
is
all
utterly
astounding
dad
cried
gabrielle
if
you
knew
who
it
was
who
deliberately
blinded
you
why
did
you
prosecute
him
because
there
was
no
witness
of
his
dastardly
act
my
child
and
i
myself
never
saw
him
therefore
i
was
compelled
to
remain
in
silence
and
allow
the
world
to
believe
my
affliction
due
to
natural
causes
was
his
blank
response
the
foreigner
laughed
again
laughed
in
the
face
of
the
man
whose
eyesight
he
had
so
deliberately
taken
he
could
not
speak
what
had
he
to
say
well
remarked
hamilton
we
have
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
both
this
man
and
his
accomplice
will
stand
their
trial
for
their
heartless
crime
in
france
and
that
they
will
meet
their
just
punishment
according
to
the
laws
of
god
and
of
man
and
i
added
walter
in
a
voice
broken
by
emotion
as
he
again
took
gabrielle
hand
tenderly
have
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
my
darling
is
cleared
of
a
foul
dastardly
and
terrible
charge
chapter
xxxix
contains
the
conclusion
after
long
consultation
krail
having
been
removed
in
custody
back
to
the
village
it
was
agreed
that
the
only
charges
that
could
be
substantiated
against
flockart
were
those
of
complicity
in
the
ingenious
attempt
upon
hamilton
life
by
which
poor
miss
bryant
had
been
sacrificed
and
also
in
the
theft
of
sir
henry
papers
but
was
it
worth
while
at
the
baronet
suggestion
he
was
allowed
freedom
to
leave
the
upstairs
room
where
he
had
been
detained
by
the
three
stalwart
servants
and
without
waiting
to
speak
to
any
one
he
had
made
his
way
down
the
drive
he
had
as
was
afterwards
found
left
auchterarder
station
for
london
an
hour
later
the
painful
impression
produced
upon
everybody
by
sir
henry
statement
of
what
had
actually
occurred
on
the
night
of
the
great
meeting
at
the
albert
hall
having
somewhat
subsided
murie
mentioned
to
the
blind
man
the
legend
of
the
whispers
and
also
the
curious
discovery
which
gabrielle
and
he
had
made
earlier
in
the
morning
ah
laughed
the
old
gentleman
a
trifle
uneasily
and
so
discovered
the
truth
at
last
eh
the
truth
no
murie
said
that
is
just
what
we
are
so
very
anxious
to
hear
from
you
sir
henry
well
he
said
you
may
rest
your
minds
perfectly
content
that
nothing
supernatural
about
them
it
was
to
my
own
advantage
to
cause
weird
reports
and
uncanny
legends
to
be
spread
in
order
to
preserve
my
secret
the
secret
of
the
whispers
but
what
is
the
secret
sir
henry
asked
hamilton
eagerly
we
curiously
enough
have
similar
whispers
at
hetzendorf
i
heard
them
myself
at
the
old
ch√¢teau
and
of
course
you
have
believed
in
the
story
which
my
good
friend
the
baron
has
caused
to
be
spread
like
myself
the
legend
that
those
who
hear
them
die
quickly
and
suddenly
said
the
old
man
with
a
smile
upon
his
grey
face
like
myself
he
wished
to
keep
away
all
inquisitive
persons
from
the
spot
but
why
asked
murie
well
truth
to
tell
the
reason
is
very
simple
he
answered
as
we
are
speaking
here
in
the
strictest
privacy
i
will
tell
you
something
which
i
beg
that
neither
of
you
will
repeat
if
you
do
it
might
result
in
my
ruin
murie
hamilton
and
gabrielle
all
gave
their
promise
then
it
is
this
he
said
i
am
head
of
a
group
of
the
leading
financial
houses
in
europe
who
remaining
secret
are
carrying
on
business
in
the
guise
of
an
unimportant
house
in
paris
the
members
of
the
syndicate
are
all
of
them
men
of
enormous
financial
strength
including
baron
de
hetzendorf
to
whom
our
friend
hamilton
here
acts
as
confidential
secretary
the
strictest
secrecy
is
necessary
for
the
success
of
our
great
undertakings
which
i
may
add
are
perfectly
honest
and
legitimate
yet
never
unless
absolutely
imperative
do
we
entrust
documents
or
letters
to
the
post
like
the
house
of
rothschild
we
have
our
confidential
messengers
and
hold
frequent
meetings
no
being
undertaken
without
we
are
all
of
us
in
full
accord
monsieur
goslin
acts
as
confidential
messenger
and
brings
me
the
views
of
my
partners
in
paris
petersburg
and
vienna
to
this
careful
concealment
of
our
plans
or
of
the
fact
that
we
are
ever
in
touch
with
one
another
is
due
the
huge
successes
we
have
made
from
time
to
time
successes
which
have
staggered
the
bourses
of
the
continent
and
caused
amazement
in
wall
street
but
being
unfortunately
afflicted
as
i
am
i
naturally
can
not
travel
to
meet
the
others
and
besides
we
are
compelled
always
to
take
fresh
and
most
elaborate
precautions
in
order
to
conceal
the
fact
that
we
are
in
connection
with
each
other
if
that
one
fact
ever
leaked
out
it
would
at
once
stultify
our
endeavours
and
weaken
our
position
hence
at
intervals
two
or
even
three
of
my
partners
travel
here
and
i
meet
them
at
night
in
the
little
chamber
which
you
walter
discovered
and
which
until
the
present
has
never
been
found
owing
to
the
weird
fables
i
have
invented
regarding
the
whispers
to
hetzendorf
too
once
or
twice
a
year
perhaps
the
members
pay
a
secret
visit
in
order
to
consult
the
baron
who
as
you
perhaps
may
know
unfortunately
enjoys
very
precarious
health
then
meetings
of
frohnmeyer
volkonski
and
the
rest
were
held
here
in
secret
sometimes
echoed
hamilton
in
surprise
on
certain
occasions
when
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
meet
them
answered
sir
henry
they
stay
at
the
station
hotel
in
perth
coming
over
to
auchterarder
by
the
last
train
at
night
and
leaving
by
the
first
train
in
the
morning
from
crieff
junction
they
never
approach
the
house
for
fear
that
servants
or
one
or
other
of
the
guests
may
recognise
them
but
go
separately
along
the
glen
and
up
the
path
to
the
ruins
when
we
thus
meet
our
voices
can
be
heard
through
the
crack
in
the
roof
of
the
chamber
in
the
courtyard
above
on
such
occasions
i
take
good
care
that
stewart
and
his
men
are
sent
on
a
false
alarm
of
poachers
to
another
part
of
the
estate
while
i
can
find
my
way
there
myself
with
my
stick
he
laughed
the
baron
i
believe
acts
on
the
same
principle
at
his
ch√¢teau
in
hungary
well
declared
hamilton
so
well
has
the
baron
kept
the
secret
that
i
have
never
had
any
suspicion
until
this
moment
by
jove
the
invention
of
the
whispers
was
certainly
a
clever
mode
of
preserving
the
secret
for
nobody
cares
deliberately
to
court
disaster
and
death
especially
among
a
superstitious
populace
like
the
villagers
here
and
the
hungarian
peasantry
both
gabrielle
and
her
lover
expressed
their
astonishment
the
latter
remarking
how
cleverly
the
weird
legend
of
the
whispers
invented
by
sir
henry
had
been
made
to
fit
historical
fact
when
the
eight
train
from
stirling
stopped
at
auchterarder
station
that
evening
a
tall
man
alighted
and
inquired
his
way
to
the
the
porter
knew
by
his
accent
that
he
was
a
londoner
but
did
not
dream
that
he
was
a
gentleman
from
scotland
yard
half
an
hour
later
after
a
chat
with
the
rural
inspector
the
pair
went
along
to
the
cell
behind
the
small
village
in
order
that
the
stranger
should
read
over
to
the
prisoner
the
warrant
he
had
brought
with
him
from
london
the
application
of
the
french
police
for
the
arrest
and
extradition
of
felix
gerlach
krail
benoist
for
the
wilful
murder
of
edna
mary
bryant
in
the
forest
of
pontarm√©
near
chantilly
the
inspector
had
related
to
the
london
detective
the
dramatic
scene
up
at
glencardine
that
day
and
the
officer
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
walked
along
to
the
cell
much
interested
to
see
what
manner
of
man
was
this
who
was
even
more
bold
and
ingenious
in
his
criminal
methods
than
many
with
whom
his
profession
brought
him
daily
into
contact
he
had
hoped
that
he
himself
would
have
the
credit
of
making
the
arrest
but
found
that
the
man
wanted
had
already
been
apprehended
on
the
charge
of
burglary
at
glencardine
the
inspector
unlocked
the
door
and
threw
it
open
but
next
instant
the
startling
truth
became
plain
felix
krail
lay
dead
upon
the
flagstones
he
had
taken
his
life
by
poison
probably
the
same
poison
he
had
placed
in
the
wine
at
the
fatal
picnic
rather
than
face
his
accuser
and
bear
his
just
punishment
many
months
have
now
passed
a
good
deal
has
occurred
since
that
day
but
it
is
all
quickly
related
james
flockart
unmasked
as
he
has
been
never
dared
to
return
the
last
heard
of
him
was
six
months
ago
in
honduras
where
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
been
compelled
to
work
for
his
living
and
had
three
weeks
after
landing
succumbed
to
fever
at
sir
henry
urgent
request
his
wife
came
back
to
glencardine
a
week
after
the
tragic
end
of
gerlach
and
was
compelled
to
make
full
confession
how
under
the
man
sinister
influence
both
she
and
flockart
had
been
forced
to
act
to
her
husband
she
proved
beyond
all
doubt
that
she
had
been
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
truth
concerning
the
affair
in
the
pontarm√©
forest
until
long
afterwards
she
had
at
first
believed
gabrielle
guilty
of
the
deed
but
when
she
learned
the
truth
and
saw
how
deeply
she
had
been
implicated
it
was
impossible
for
her
then
to
withdraw
with
a
generosity
seldom
found
in
men
sir
henry
after
long
reflection
and
a
desperate
struggle
with
himself
forgave
her
and
now
has
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
prefers
quiet
healthful
glencardine
to
the
social
gaieties
of
park
street
paris
or
san
remo
while
she
and
gabrielle
have
lately
become
devoted
to
each
other
the
secret
syndicate
with
sir
henry
heyburn
at
its
head
still
operates
for
no
word
of
its
existence
has
leaked
out
to
either
financial
circles
or
to
the
public
while
the
whispers
of
glencardine
are
still
believed
in
and
dreaded
by
the
whole
countryside
across
the
ochils
edgar
hamilton
though
compelled
to
return
to
the
baron
whose
right
hand
he
is
often
travels
to
glencardine
with
confidential
messages
and
documents
for
signature
and
is
of
course
an
guest
the
unpretentious
house
of
l√©nard
et
morellet
of
paris
now
and
then
effects
deals
so
enormous
that
financial
circles
are
staggered
and
the
world
stands
amazed
the
true
facts
of
who
is
actually
behind
that
apparently
unimportant
firm
are
however
still
rigorously
and
ingeniously
concealed
who
would
ever
dream
that
that
quiet
man
with
the
sightless
eyes
living
far
away
up
in
scotland
passing
his
hours
of
darkness
with
his
old
bronze
seals
or
his
knitting
was
the
brain
which
directed
their
marvellously
successful
operations
the
laird
of
connachan
died
quite
suddenly
about
seven
months
ago
and
walter
murie
succeeded
to
the
noble
estate
gabrielle
sweet
almost
in
her
simple
tastes
and
delightful
charm
and
more
devoted
to
walter
than
ever
is
now
little
lady
murie
having
been
married
in
edinburgh
a
month
ago
at
the
moment
that
i
pen
these
final
lines
the
pair
are
spending
a
blissful
honeymoon
at
the
great
old
ch√¢teau
of
hetzendorf
high
up
above
the
danube
the
baron
having
kindly
vacated
the
place
and
put
it
at
their
disposal
for
the
summer
happy
in
each
other
love
and
mutual
trust
they
spend
the
long
blissful
days
in
company
wandering
often
hand
in
hand
for
when
walter
looks
into
those
wonderful
eyes
of
hers
he
sees
mirrored
there
a
perfect
and
abiding
affection
such
as
is
indeed
given
few
men
to
possess
together
they
have
in
secret
explored
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
stronghold
and
by
directions
given
them
by
the
baron
have
found
there
a
stone
chamber
by
no
means
dissimilar
to
that
at
glencardine
meanwhile
sir
henry
heyburn
impatient
for
his
beloved
daughter
to
be
again
near
him
and
to
assist
him
passes
his
weary
hours
with
his
favourite
hobby
his
wife
full
of
sympathy
bearing
him
company
from
her
however
he
still
withholds
one
secret
and
one
only
the
secret
of
the
house
of
whispers
