chapter
i
i
plan
a
voyage
by
the
bequest
of
an
elder
brother
i
was
left
enough
money
to
see
me
through
a
small
college
in
ohio
and
to
secure
me
four
years
in
a
medical
school
in
the
east
why
i
chose
medicine
i
hardly
know
possibly
the
career
of
a
surgeon
attracted
the
adventurous
element
in
me
perhaps
coming
of
a
family
of
doctors
i
merely
followed
the
line
of
least
resistance
it
may
be
indirectly
but
inevitably
that
i
might
be
on
the
yacht
ella
on
that
terrible
night
of
august
more
than
a
year
ago
i
got
through
somehow
i
played
quarterback
on
the
football
team
and
made
some
money
coaching
in
summer
i
did
whatever
came
to
hand
from
chartering
a
at
a
summer
resort
and
taking
passengers
at
so
much
a
head
to
checking
up
cucumbers
in
indiana
for
a
western
pickle
house
i
was
practically
alone
commencement
left
me
with
a
diploma
a
new
an
medical
library
a
box
of
surgical
instruments
of
the
same
date
as
the
books
and
an
incipient
case
of
typhoid
fever
i
was
six
feet
tall
and
forty
inches
around
the
chest
also
i
had
lived
clean
and
worked
and
played
hard
i
got
over
the
fever
finally
pretty
much
all
bone
and
appetite
but
alive
thanks
to
the
college
my
hospital
care
had
cost
nothing
it
was
a
good
thing
i
had
just
seven
dollars
in
the
world
the
yacht
ella
lay
in
the
river
not
far
from
my
hospital
windows
she
was
not
a
yacht
when
i
first
saw
her
nor
at
any
time
technically
unless
i
use
the
word
in
the
broad
sense
of
a
she
was
a
and
when
i
saw
her
first
as
dirty
and
disreputable
as
are
most
her
rejuvenation
was
the
history
of
my
convalescence
on
the
day
she
stood
forth
in
her
first
coat
of
white
paint
i
exchanged
my
for
clothing
that
however
loosely
it
hung
was
still
clothing
her
new
sails
marked
my
promotion
to
beefsteak
her
brass
rails
and
awnings
my
first
independent
excursion
up
and
down
the
corridor
outside
my
door
and
incidentally
my
return
to
a
collar
and
tie
the
river
shipping
appealed
to
me
to
my
imagination
clean
washed
by
my
illness
and
ready
as
a
child
for
new
impressions
liners
gliding
down
to
the
bay
and
the
open
sea
shrewish
scolding
tugs
dirty
but
picturesque
tramps
my
enthusiasm
amused
the
nurses
whose
ideas
of
adventure
consisted
of
little
jaunts
of
exploration
into
the
abdominal
cavity
and
whose
aseptic
minds
revolted
at
the
sight
of
dirty
sails
one
day
i
pointed
out
to
one
of
them
an
old
schooner
red
and
brown
with
patched
canvas
spread
moving
swiftly
down
the
river
before
a
stiff
breeze
look
at
her
i
exclaimed
there
goes
adventure
mystery
romance
i
should
like
to
be
sailing
on
her
you
would
have
to
boil
the
she
replied
dryly
and
the
ship
is
probably
swarming
with
rats
rats
i
affirmed
add
to
the
local
color
ships
are
their
native
habitat
only
sinking
ships
do
have
them
but
her
answer
was
to
retort
that
rats
carried
bubonic
plague
and
to
exit
carrying
the
i
was
ravenous
as
are
all
convalescent
typhoids
and
one
of
the
ways
in
which
i
eked
out
my
still
slender
diet
was
by
robbing
the
at
meals
that
day
i
think
it
was
the
deck
furniture
was
put
out
on
the
ella
numbers
of
white
wicker
chairs
and
tables
with
bright
cushions
to
match
the
awnings
i
had
a
pair
of
ancient
as
obsolete
as
my
amputating
knives
and
like
them
a
part
of
my
heritage
by
that
time
i
felt
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
ella
and
through
my
glasses
carefully
focused
with
a
pair
of
scissors
watched
the
arrangement
of
the
deck
furnishings
a
girl
was
directing
the
men
i
judged
from
the
poise
with
which
she
carried
herself
that
she
was
attractive
and
knew
it
how
beautiful
she
was
and
how
well
she
knew
it
i
was
to
find
out
before
long
mcwhirter
to
the
contrary
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
decision
to
sign
as
a
sailor
on
the
ella
one
of
the
bright
spots
of
that
long
hot
summer
was
mcwhirter
we
had
graduated
together
in
june
and
in
october
he
was
to
enter
a
hospital
in
buffalo
as
a
resident
but
he
was
as
indigent
as
i
and
from
june
to
october
is
four
months
four
months
he
said
to
me
even
at
two
meals
a
day
boy
something
over
two
hundred
and
forty
and
i
can
eat
four
times
a
day
without
a
struggle
would
you
think
one
of
these
dubs
would
take
a
vacation
and
give
me
a
chance
to
hold
down
his
practice
nothing
of
the
sort
developing
mcwhirter
went
into
a
and
managed
to
pull
through
the
summer
with
unimpaired
cheerfulness
confiding
to
me
that
he
secured
his
luncheons
free
at
the
soda
counter
he
came
frequently
to
see
me
bringing
always
a
pocketful
of
chewing
gum
which
he
assured
me
was
excellent
to
allay
the
gnawings
of
hunger
and
later
as
my
condition
warranted
it
small
bags
of
and
other
pharmacy
confections
mcwhirter
it
was
who
got
me
my
berth
on
the
ella
it
must
have
been
about
the
of
july
for
the
ella
sailed
on
the
i
was
strong
enough
to
leave
the
hospital
but
not
yet
physically
able
for
any
prolonged
exertion
mcwhirter
who
was
short
and
stout
had
been
alternately
flirting
with
the
nurse
as
she
moved
in
and
out
preparing
my
room
for
the
night
and
sizing
me
up
through
narrowed
eyes
no
he
said
evidently
following
a
private
line
of
thought
you
do
belong
behind
a
counter
leslie
i
darned
if
i
think
you
belong
in
the
medical
profession
either
the
british
army
suit
you
the
what
you
know
kipling
idea
riding
horseback
head
of
a
column
undress
uniform
colonel
wife
making
eyes
at
you
leading
last
hopes
and
all
that
the
british
army
with
kipling
trimmings
being
out
of
the
question
the
original
issue
is
still
before
us
i
have
to
work
mac
and
work
like
the
devil
if
i
to
feed
myself
there
being
no
answer
to
this
mcwhirter
contented
himself
with
eyeing
me
i
thinking
i
said
of
going
to
europe
the
sea
is
calling
me
mac
so
was
the
grave
a
month
ago
but
it
did
get
you
do
be
an
ass
boy
how
are
you
going
to
sea
before
the
mast
this
apparently
conveying
no
meaning
to
mcwhirter
i
supplemented
as
a
common
sailor
he
was
indignant
at
first
offering
me
his
room
and
a
part
of
his
small
salary
until
i
got
my
strength
then
he
became
dubious
and
finally
so
well
did
i
paint
my
picture
of
long
idle
days
on
the
ocean
of
sweet
cool
nights
under
the
stars
with
breezes
that
purred
through
the
sails
rocking
the
ship
to
slumber
finally
he
waxed
enthusiastic
and
was
even
for
giving
up
the
pharmacy
at
once
and
sailing
with
me
he
had
been
fitting
out
the
storeroom
of
a
with
drugs
he
informed
me
and
doing
it
under
the
personal
direction
of
the
wife
i
made
a
hit
with
her
he
confided
since
she
learned
i
a
graduate
she
letting
me
do
the
whole
thing
i
made
up
some
lotions
to
prevent
sunburn
and
that
seasick
prescription
of
old
larimer
and
she
thinks
i
the
whole
cheese
i
suggest
you
as
ship
doctor
how
many
men
in
the
crew
eight
i
think
or
ten
it
a
small
boat
and
carries
a
small
crew
then
they
do
want
a
ship
doctor
if
i
go
i
go
as
a
sailor
i
said
firmly
and
i
want
your
word
mac
not
a
word
about
me
except
that
i
am
honest
you
have
to
wash
decks
probably
i
am
filled
with
a
wild
longing
to
wash
decks
i
asserted
smiling
at
his
disturbed
face
i
should
probably
also
have
to
polish
brass
there
a
great
deal
of
brass
on
the
boat
how
do
you
know
that
when
i
told
him
he
was
much
excited
and
although
it
was
dark
and
the
ella
consisted
of
three
lights
he
insisted
on
the
and
was
persuaded
he
saw
her
finally
he
put
down
the
glasses
and
came
over
to
me
perhaps
you
are
right
leslie
he
said
soberly
you
do
want
charity
any
more
than
they
want
a
ship
doctor
wherever
you
go
and
whatever
you
do
whether
you
swabbing
decks
in
your
bare
feet
or
polishing
brass
railings
with
an
old
sock
you
a
man
he
was
more
moved
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
and
ate
a
to
cover
his
embarrassment
soon
after
that
he
took
his
departure
and
the
following
day
he
telephoned
to
say
that
if
the
sea
was
still
calling
me
he
could
get
a
note
to
the
captain
recommending
me
i
asked
him
to
get
the
note
good
old
mac
the
sea
was
calling
me
true
enough
but
only
dire
necessity
was
driving
me
to
ship
before
the
mast
necessity
and
perhaps
what
for
want
of
a
better
name
we
call
destiny
for
what
is
fate
but
inevitable
law
inevitable
consequence
the
stirring
of
my
blood
generations
removed
from
a
seafaring
ancestor
my
illness
not
a
cause
but
a
result
mcwhirter

of

and

wife

the
mulatto
tom
singleton
and

all
thrown
together
a
of
characters
motives
passions
and
hereditary
tendencies
through
an
inevitable
law
working
together
toward
that
terrible
night
of
august
when
hell
seemed
loose
on
a
painted
sea
chapter
ii
the
painted
ship
the
ella
had
been
a
carrying
dressed
lumber
to
south
america
and
on
her
return
trip
bringing
a
miscellaneous
cargo
hides
and
wool
sugar
from
pernambuco
whatever
offered
the
firm
of
turner
and
sons
owned
the
line
of
which
the
ella
was
one
of
the
smallest
vessels
the
gradual
elimination
of
sailing
ships
and
the
substitution
of
steamers
in
the
coasting
trade
left
the
ella
with
others
out
of
commission
she
was
still
seaworthy
rather
fast
as
such
vessels
go
and
steady
marshall
turner
the
oldest
son
of
old
elias
turner
the
founder
of
the
business
bought
it
in
at
a
nominal
sum
with
the
intention
of
using
it
as
a
private
yacht
and
since
it
was
a
superstition
of
the
house
never
to
change
the
name
of
one
of
its
vessels
the
schooner
ella
odorous
of
fresh
lumber
or
raw
rubber
as
the
case
might
be
dingy
gray
in
color
with
slovenly
decks
on
which
lines
of
seamen
clothing
were
generally
hanging
to
dry
remained
in
her
metamorphosis
still
the
ella
marshall
turner
was
a
wealthy
man
but
he
equipped
his
new
very
modestly
as
few
changes
as
were
possible
were
made
he
increased
the
size
of
the
forward
house
adding
quarters
for
the
captain
and
the
two
mates
and
thus
kept
the
after
house
for
himself
and
his
friends
he
fumigated
the
hold
and
the
forecastle
a
precaution
that
kept
all
the
crew
coughing
for
two
days
and
drove
them
out
of
the
odor
of
formaldehyde
to
the
deck
to
sleep
he
installed
an
electric
lighting
and
refrigerating
plant
put
a
bath
in
the
forecastle
to
the
bewilderment
of
the
men
who
were
inclined
to
think
it
a
reflection
on
their
habits
and
almost
entirely
rebuilt
inside
the
old
officers
quarters
in
the
after
house
the
wheel
replaced
by
a
new
one
white
and
gilt
remained
in
its
old
position
behind
the
after
house
the
steersman
standing
on
a
raised
iron
grating
above
the
wash
of
the
deck
thus
from
the
which
had
become
a
sort
of
lounge
and
through
a
small
barred
window
it
was
possible
to
see
the
man
at
the
wheel
who
in
his
turn
commanded
a
view
of
part
of
the
chartroom
but
not
of
the
floor
the
craft
was
carried
three
lifeboats
and
a
collapsible
raft
and
was
navigated
by
a
captain
first
and
second
mates
and
a
crew
of
six
sailors
and
one
gaunt
youth
whose
sole
knowledge
of
navigation
had
been
gained
on
an
atlantic
city
catboat
her
destination
was
vague
panama
perhaps
possibly
a
south
american
port
depending
on
the
weather
and
the
whim
of
the
owner
i
do
not
recall
that
i
performed
the
nautical
rite
of
signing
articles
armed
with
the
note
mcwhirter
had
secured
for
me
and
with
what
i
fondly
hoped
was
the
rolling
gait
of
the
seafaring
man
i
approached
the
captain
a
bearded
and
florid
individual
i
had
dressed
the
part
old
trousers
a
cap
and
a
sweater
from
which
i
had
removed
my
college
letter
mcwhirter
who
had
supervised
my
preparations
and
who
had
accompanied
me
to
the
wharf
had
suggested
that
i
omit
my
morning
shave
the
result
was
as
i
look
back
a
lean
and
cadaverous
youth
with
the
hospital
pallor
still
on
him
his
chin
covered
with
a
day
beard
his
hair
cropped
short
and
a
cannibalistic
gleam
in
his
eyes
i
remember
that
my
wrists
thin
and
bony
annoyed
me
and
that
the
girl
i
had
seen
through
the
came
on
board
and
stood
off
detached
and
indifferent
but
with
her
eyes
on
me
while
the
captain
read
my
letter
when
he
finished
he
held
it
out
to
me
i
got
my
crew
he
said
curtly
there
is
i
suppose
there
no
chance
of
your
needing
another
hand
no
he
turned
away
then
glanced
back
at
the
letter
i
was
still
holding
rather
dazed
you
can
leave
your
name
and
address
with
the
mate
over
there
if
anything
turns
up
he
let
you
know
my
address
the
hospital
i
folded
the
useless
letter
and
thrust
it
into
my
pocket
the
captain
had
gone
forward
and
the
girl
with
the
cool
eyes
was
leaning
against
the
rail
watching
me
you
are
the
man
mcwhirter
has
been
looking
after
are
you
yes
i
pulled
off
my
cap
and
recollecting
myself
yes
miss
you
are
not
a
sailor
i
have
had
some
experience
and
i
am
willing
you
have
been
ill
have
you
yes
miss
could
you
polish
brass
and
things
like
that
i
could
try
my
arms
are
strong
enough
it
is
only
when
i
walk
but
she
did
not
let
me
finish
she
left
the
rail
abruptly
and
disappeared
down
the
companionway
into
the
after
house
i
waited
uncertainly
the
captain
saw
me
still
loitering
and
scowled
a
procession
of
men
with
trunks
jostled
me
a
colored
man
evidently
a
butler
ordered
me
out
of
his
way
while
he
carried
down
into
the
cabin
with
almost
reverent
care
a
basket
of
wine
when
the
girl
returned
she
came
to
me
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
me
over
with
cool
appraising
eyes
i
had
been
right
about
her
appearance
she
was
charming
or
no
hardly
charming
she
was
too
aloof
for
that
but
she
was
beautiful
an
irish
type
with
eyes
and
almost
black
hair
the
tilt
of
her
head
was
haughty
later
i
came
to
know
that
her
hauteur
was
indifference
but
at
first
i
was
frankly
afraid
of
her
afraid
of
her
cool
mocking
eyes
and
the
upward
thrust
of
her
chin
my
is
not
here
she
said
after
a
moment
but
my
sister
is
below
in
the
cabin
she
will
speak
to
the
captain
about
you
where
are
your
things
i
glanced
toward
the
hospital
where
my
few
worldly
possessions
including
my
dress
clothes
my
amputating
set
and
such
of
my
books
as
i
had
not
been
able
to
sell
were
awaiting
disposition
very
near
miss
i
said
better
bring
them
at
once
we
are
sailing
in
the
morning
she
turned
away
as
if
to
avoid
my
thanks
but
stopped
and
came
back
we
are
taking
you
as
a
sort
of
extra
man
she
explained
you
will
work
with
the
crew
but
it
is
possible
that
we
will
need
you
do
you
know
anything
about
butler
work
i
hesitated
if
i
said
yes
and
then
failed
i
could
try
i
thought
from
your
appearance
perhaps
you
had
done
something
of
the
sort
oh
shades
of
my
medical
forebears
who
had
bequeathed
me
along
with
the
library
what
i
had
hoped
was
a
professional
manner
the
butler
is
a
poor
sailor
if
he
fails
us
you
will
take
his
place
she
gave
a
curt
little
nod
of
dismissal
and
i
went
down
the
gangplank
and
along
the
wharf
i
had
secured
what
i
went
for
my
summer
was
provided
for
and
i
was
still
seven
dollars
to
the
good
i
was
exultant
but
with
my
exultation
was
mixed
a
curious
anger
at
mcwhirter
that
he
had
advised
me
not
to
shave
that
morning
my
preparation
took
little
time
such
of
my
wardrobe
as
was
worth
saving
mcwhirter
took
charge
of
i
sold
the
remainder
of
my
books
and
in
a
sailor
i
purchased
boots
and
slickers
the
sailors
oil
skins
with
my
last
money
i
bought
a
good
revolver
and
cartridges
i
was
glad
later
that
i
had
bought
the
revolver
and
that
i
had
taken
with
me
the
surgical
instruments
antiquated
as
they
were
which
in
their
mahogany
case
had
accompanied
my
grandfather
through
the
civil
war
and
had
done
as
he
was
wont
to
chuckle
as
much
damage
as
a
mcwhirter
came
to
the
wharf
with
me
and
looked
the
ella
over
with
eyes
of
proprietorship
pretty
boat
he
said
if
the
nigger
gets
sick
give
him
some
of
my
seasick
remedy
and
take
care
of
yourself
boy
he
shook
hands
his
open
face
flushed
with
emotion
darned
shame
to
see
you
going
like
this
do
eat
too
much
and
do
fall
in
love
with
any
of
the
women
he
started
away
and
i
turned
toward
the
ship
but
a
moment
later
i
heard
him
calling
me
he
came
back
rather
breathless
up
in
my
neighborhood
he
panted
they
say
turner
is
a
devil
whatever
happens
it
not
your
better
better
tuck
your
gun
under
your
mattress
and
forget
you
got
it
you
got
some
disposition
yourself
the
ella
sailed
the
following
day
at
ten
she
carried
nineteen
people
of
whom
five
were
the
turners
and
their
guests
the
cabin
was
full
of
flowers
and
days
later
she
came
into
port
again
a
lifeboat
covered
with
canvas
trailing
at
her
stern
chapter
iii
i
unclench
my
hands
from
the
first
the
captain
disclaimed
responsibility
for
me
i
was
housed
in
the
forecastle
and
ate
with
the
men
there
however
my
connection
with
the
crew
and
the
navigation
of
the
ship
ended
perhaps
it
was
as
well
although
i
resented
it
at
first
i
was
weaker
than
i
had
thought
and
dizzy
at
the
mere
thought
of
going
aloft
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
found
myself
a
sort
of
given
the
responsibility
of
looking
after
the
and
other
deck
games
the
the
cards
for
they
played
bridge
steadily
and
answerable
to
george
williams
the
colored
butler
for
the
various
liquors
served
on
deck
the
work
was
easy
and
the
situation
rather
amused
me
after
an
effort
or
two
to
bully
me
one
of
which
resulted
in
my
holding
him
over
the
rail
until
he
turned
gray
with
fright
williams
treated
me
as
an
equal
which
was
gratifying
the
weather
was
good
the
food
fair
i
had
no
reason
to
repent
my
bargain
of
the
sailing
qualities
of
the
ella
there
could
be
no
question
the
crew
selected
by
captain
richardson
from
the
best
men
of
the
turner
line
knew
their
business
and
especially
after
the
williams
incident
made
me
one
of
themselves
barring
the
odor
of
formaldehyde
in
the
forecastle
which
drove
me
to
sleeping
on
deck
for
a
night
or
two
everything
was
going
smoothly
at
least
on
the
surface
smoothly
as
far
as
the
crew
was
concerned
i
was
not
so
sure
about
the
after
house
as
i
have
said
owing
to
the
small
size
of
the
vessel
and
the
fact
that
considerable
of
the
space
had
been
used
for
baths
there
were
besides
the
family
only
two
guests
a
johns
a
divorcee
and
a
vail
turner
and
miss
lee
shared
the
services
of
a
maid
karen
hansen
who
with
a
stewardess
henrietta
sloane
occupied
a
double
cabin
vail
had
a
small
room
as
had
turner
with
a
bath
between
which
they
used
in
common
turner
room
was
a
large
one
with
its
own
bath
into
which
elsa
lee
room
also
opened
johns
had
a
room
and
bath
roughly
and
not
drawn
to
scale
the
living
quarters
of
the
family
were
arranged
like
the
diagram
in
chapter
xix
i
have
said
that
things
were
not
going
smoothly
in
the
after
house
i
felt
it
rather
than
saw
it
the
women
rose
late
except
miss
lee
who
was
frequently
about
when
i
washed
the
deck
they
chatted
and
laughed
together
read
played
bridge
when
the
men
were
so
inclined
and
now
and
then
when
their
attention
was
drawn
to
it
looked
at
the
sea
they
were
always
exquisitely
and
carefully
dressed
and
i
looked
at
them
as
i
would
at
any
other
masterpieces
of
creative
art
with
nothing
of
covetousness
in
my
admiration
the
men
were
violently
opposed
types
turner
tall
morose
by
habit
with
a
prominent
nose
and
rapidly
thinning
hair
and
with
strong
pale
blue
eyes
congested
from
hard
drinking
vail
shorter
by
three
inches
dark
with
that
dusky
flush
under
the
skin
which
shows
good
red
blood
and
as
temperate
as
turner
was
dissipated
vail
was
strong
too
after
i
had
held
williams
over
the
rail
i
turned
to
find
him
looking
on
amused
and
when
the
frightened
darky
had
taken
himself
muttering
threats
to
the
galley
vail
came
over
to
me
and
ran
his
hand
down
my
arm
where
did
you
get
it
he
asked
oh
i
always
had
some
muscle
i
said
i
in
bad
shape
now
just
getting
over
fever
fever
eh
i
thought
it
was
jail
look
here
he
threw
out
his
biceps
for
me
to
feel
it
was
a
ball
of
iron
under
my
fingers
the
man
was
as
strong
as
an
ox
he
smiled
at
my
surprise
and
after
looking
to
see
that
no
one
was
in
sight
offered
to
mix
me
a
highball
from
a
decanter
and
siphon
on
a
table
i
refused
it
was
his
turn
to
be
surprised
i
gave
it
up
when
i
was
in
train
in
the
hospital
i
corrected
myself
i
find
i
do
miss
it
he
eyed
me
with
some
curiosity
over
his
glass
and
sauntering
away
left
me
to
my
work
of
folding
rugs
but
when
i
had
finished
and
was
chalking
the
deck
for
he
joined
me
again
dropping
his
voice
for
the
women
had
come
up
by
that
time
and
were
breakfasting
on
the
lee
side
of
the
after
house
have
you
any
idea
leslie
how
much
whiskey
there
is
on
board
williams
has
considerable
i
believe
i
do
think
there
is
any
in
the
forward
house
the
captain
is
a
teetotaler
i
see
when
these
decanters
go
back
williams
takes
charge
of
them
yes
he
locks
them
away
he
dropped
his
voice
still
lower
empty
them
leslie
he
said
do
you
understand
throw
what
is
left
overboard
and
if
you
get
a
chance
at
williams
key
pitch
a
dozen
or
two
quarts
overboard
and
be
put
in
irons
not
necessarily
i
think
you
understand
me
i
do
trust
williams
in
a
week
we
could
have
this
boat
fairly
dry
there
is
a
great
deal
of
wine
he
scowled
damn
williams
anyhow
his
instructions
were
but
never
mind
about
that
get
rid
of
the
whiskey
turner
coming
up
the
companionway
at
that
moment
vail
left
me
i
had
understood
him
perfectly
it
was
common
talk
in
the
forecastle
that
turner
was
drinking
hard
and
that
in
fact
the
cruise
had
been
arranged
by
his
family
in
the
hope
that
away
from
his
clubs
he
would
alter
his
habits
a
fallacy
of
course
taken
away
from
his
customary
daily
round
given
idle
days
on
a
summer
sea
and
aided
by
williams
the
butler
he
was
drinking
his
head
off
early
as
it
was
he
was
somewhat
the
worse
for
it
that
morning
he
made
directly
for
me
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
noticed
me
although
it
was
the
third
day
out
he
stood
in
front
of
me
his
red
eyes
flaming
and
although
i
am
a
tall
man
he
had
an
inch
perhaps
the
advantage
of
me
what
this
about
williams
he
demanded
furiously
what
do
you
mean
by
a
thing
like
that
he
was
bullying
me
i
did
intend
to
drop
him
the
ship
was
rolling
gently
he
made
a
pass
at
me
with
a
magazine
he
carried
and
almost
lost
his
balance
the
women
had
risen
and
were
watching
from
the
corner
of
the
after
house
i
caught
him
and
steadied
him
until
he
could
clutch
a
chair
you
try
any
tricks
like
that
again
and
you
go
overboard
he
stormed
who
are
you
anyhow
not
one
of
our
men
i
saw
the
quick
look
between
vail
and
turner
and
saw
her
come
forward
johns
followed
her
smiling
marsh
turner
protested
i
told
you
about
him
the
man
who
had
been
oh
another
of
your
friends
he
sneered
and
looked
from
me
to
vail
with
his
ugly
smile
vail
went
rather
pale
and
threw
up
his
head
quickly
the
next
moment
johns
had
saved
the
situation
with
an
irrelevant
remark
and
the
incident
was
over
they
were
playing
bridge
not
without
dispute
but
at
least
without
insult
but
i
had
hard
a
glimpse
beneath
the
surface
of
that
luxurious
cruise
one
of
many
such
in
the
next
few
days
that
was
on
monday
the
third
day
out
up
to
that
time
miss
lee
had
not
noticed
me
except
once
when
she
found
me
scrubbing
the
deck
to
comment
on
a
corner
that
she
thought
might
be
cleaner
and
another
time
in
the
evening
when
she
and
vail
sat
in
chairs
until
late
when
she
had
sent
me
below
for
a
wrap
she
looked
past
me
rather
than
at
me
gave
me
her
orders
quietly
but
briefly
and
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
ignore
me
and
yet
once
or
twice
i
had
found
her
eyes
fixed
on
me
with
a
cool
expression
as
if
she
found
something
in
my
struggles
to
carry
trays
as
if
i
had
been
accustomed
to
them
or
to
handle
a
mop
as
a
mop
should
be
handled
and
not
like
a
hockey
stick
something
infinitely
entertaining
and
not
a
little
absurd
but
that
morning
after
they
had
settled
to
bridge
she
followed
me
to
the
rail
out
of
earshot
i
straightened
and
took
off
my
cap
and
she
stood
looking
at
me
unsmiling
unclench
your
hands
she
said
i
beg
your
pardon
i
straightened
out
my
fingers
conscious
for
the
first
time
of
my
clenched
fists
and
even
opened
and
closed
them
once
or
twice
to
prove
their
relaxation
that
better
now
wo
you
try
to
remember
that
i
am
responsible
for
your
being
here
and
be
careful
then
take
me
away
from
here
and
put
me
with
the
crew
i
am
stronger
now
ask
the
captain
to
give
me
a
man
work
this
this
is
a
housemaid
occupation
we
prefer
to
have
you
here
she
said
coldly
and
then
evidently
repenting
her
manner
we
need
a
man
here
leslie
better
stay
are
you
comfortable
in
the
forecastle
yes
miss
lee
and
the
food
is
all
right
the
cook
says
i
am
eating
two
men
rations
she
turned
to
leave
smiling
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
thrown
even
a
fleeting
smile
my
way
and
it
went
to
my
head
and
williams
i
am
to
submit
to
his
insolence
she
stopped
and
turned
and
the
smile
faded
the
next
time
she
said
you
are
to
drop
him
but
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
she
neither
spoke
to
me
nor
looked
as
far
as
i
could
tell
in
my
direction
she
flirted
openly
with
vail
rather
i
thought
to
the
discomfort
of
johns
who
had
appropriated
him
to
herself
sang
to
him
in
the
cabin
and
in
the
long
hour
before
dinner
when
the
others
were
dressing
walked
the
deck
with
him
talking
earnestly
they
looked
well
together
and
i
believe
he
was
in
love
with
her
poor
vail
turner
had
gone
below
grimly
to
dress
for
dinner
and
i
went
aft
to
chat
as
i
often
did
with
the
steersman
on
this
occasion
it
happened
to
be
charlie
jones
jones
was
not
his
name
so
far
as
i
know
it
was
some
inordinately
long
and
different
german
inheritance
and
so
with
the
facility
of
the
average
crew
he
had
been
called
jones
he
was
a
benevolent
little
man
highly
religious
and
something
of
a
philosopher
and
because
i
could
understand
german
and
even
essay
it
in
a
limited
way
he
was
fond
of
me
seta
du
dick
he
said
and
moved
over
so
that
i
could
sit
on
the
grating
on
which
he
stood
the
sky
is
fine
wunderschon
it
always
looks
good
to
me
i
observed
filling
my
pipe
and
passing
my
to
him
i
may
have
my
doubts
now
and
then
on
land
charlie
but
here
between
the
sky
and
the
sea
i
a
believer
right
enough
the
beginning
he
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
said
charlie
reverently
we
were
silent
for
a
time
the
ship
rolled
easily
now
and
then
she
dipped
her
bowsprit
with
a
soft
swish
of
spray
a
school
of
dolphins
played
astern
and
the
last
of
the
land
birds
that
had
followed
us
out
flew
in
circles
around
the
masts
sometimes
said
charlie
jones
i
think
the
good
man
should
have
left
it
the
way
it
was
after
the
flood
just
sky
and
water
what
the
land
anyhow
noise
and
confusion
wickedness
and
crime
robbing
the
widow
and
the
orphan
eat
or
be
et
well
i
argued
the
sea
that
way
what
are
those
fish
out
there
flying
for
but
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
bigger
fish
charlie
jones
surveyed
me
over
his
pipe
true
enough
youngster
he
said
but
the
lord
given
wings
to
fly
with
he
ai
been
so
careful
with
the
widow
and
the
orphan
this
statement
being
incontrovertible
i
let
the
argument
lapse
and
sat
quiet
luxuriating
in
the
warmth
in
the
fresh
breeze
in
the
feeling
of
bodily
that
came
with
my
returning
strength
i
got
up
and
stretched
and
my
eyes
fell
on
the
small
window
of
the
the
door
into
the
main
cabin
beyond
was
open
it
was
dark
with
the
summer
twilight
except
for
the
four
candles
on
the
table
now
laid
for
dinner
a
curious
effect
it
had
the
white
cloth
and
gleaming
pink
an
island
of
cheer
in
a
twilight
sea
and
to
and
from
this
rosy
island
making
short
excursions
advancing
retreating
disappearing
at
times
the
oval
white
ship
that
was
williams
shirt
bosom
charlie
jones
bending
to
the
right
and
raised
to
my
own
height
by
the
grating
on
which
he
stood
looked
over
my
shoulder
dinner
was
about
to
be
served
the
women
had
come
out
the
threw
their
rosy
glow
over
white
necks
and
uncovered
arms
and
revealed
higher
in
the
shadows
the
faces
of
the
men
smug
assured
rather
heavy
i
had
been
the
guest
of
honor
on
a
a
year
or
two
before
after
a
game
there
had
been
pink
lights
on
the
table
i
remembered
and
the
at
dinner
the
first
night
out
had
been
caricatures
of
me
in
fighting
trim
there
had
been
a
girl
too
for
the
three
days
of
that
cruise
i
had
been
mad
about
her
before
that
first
dinner
when
i
had
known
her
two
hours
i
had
kissed
her
hand
and
told
her
i
loved
her
vail
and
miss
lee
had
left
the
others
and
come
into
the
as
charlie
jones
and
i
looked
he
bent
over
and
kissed
her
hand
the
sun
had
gone
down
my
pipe
was
empty
and
from
the
galley
forward
came
the
odor
of
the
forecastle
supper
charlie
was
coughing
a
racking
paroxysm
that
shook
his
wiry
body
he
leaned
over
and
caught
my
shoulder
as
i
was
moving
away
new
paint
and
new
canvas
do
make
a
new
ship
he
said
choking
back
the
cough
she
still
the
old
ella
the
of
the
turner
line
pink
lights
below
and
not
a
rat
in
the
hold
they
left
her
before
we
sailed
boy
every
rope
was
crawling
with
the
very
rats
instinctively
had
left
it
i
quoted
but
charlie
clutching
the
wheel
was
coughing
again
and
cursing
breathlessly
as
he
coughed
chapter
iv
i
receive
a
warning
the
odor
of
formaldehyde
in
the
forecastle
having
abated
permission
for
the
crew
to
sleep
on
deck
had
been
withdrawn
but
the
weather
as
we
turned
south
had
grown
insufferably
hot
the
reek
of
the
forecastle
sickened
me
the
odor
of
fresh
paint
hardly
dry
of
musty
clothing
and
sweaty
bodies
i
asked
singleton
the
first
mate
for
permission
to
sleep
on
deck
and
was
refused
i
went
down
obediently
enough
to
be
driven
back
with
nausea
and
so
watching
my
chance
i
waited
until
the
first
mate
on
watch
disappeared
into
the
forward
cabin
to
eat
the
night
lunch
always
prepared
by
the
cook
and
left
there
then
with
a
blanket
and
pillow
i
crawled
into
the
starboard
lifeboat
and
settled
myself
for
the
night
the
lookout
saw
me
but
gave
no
sign
it
was
not
a
bad
berth
as
the
ship
listed
the
stars
seemed
to
sway
above
me
and
my
last
recollection
was
of
the
great
dipper
performing
dignified
gyrations
in
the
sky
i
was
aroused
by
one
of
the
two
lookouts
a
young
fellow
named
burns
he
was
standing
below
rapping
on
the
side
of
the
boat
with
his
knuckles
i
sat
up
and
peered
over
at
him
and
was
conscious
for
the
first
time
that
the
weather
had
changed
a
fine
rain
was
falling
my
hair
and
shirt
were
wet
something
doing
in
the
he
said
cautiously
thought
you
might
not
want
to
miss
it
he
was
in
his
bare
feet
as
was
i
together
we
hurried
to
the
after
house
the
steersman
in
oilskins
was
at
his
post
but
was
peering
through
the
barred
window
into
the
which
was
brilliantly
lighted
he
stepped
aside
somewhat
to
let
us
look
in
the
loud
and
furious
voices
which
had
guided
us
had
quieted
but
the
situation
had
not
relaxed
singleton
the
first
mate
and
turner
were
sitting
at
a
table
littered
with
bottles
and
glasses
and
standing
over
them
white
with
fury
was
captain
richardson
in
the
doorway
to
the
main
cabin
dressed
in
pajamas
and
a
bathrobe
vail
was
watching
the
scene
i
told
you
last
night
turner
the
captain
said
banging
the
table
with
his
fist
i
wo
have
you
interfering
with
my
officers
or
with
my
ship
that
man
on
duty
and
he
drunk
your
ship
turner
sneered
thickly
it
my
ship
and
i
i
discharge
you
he
got
to
his
feet
holding
to
the
table
singleton
hic
from
now
on
you
captain
captain
singleton
how
how
d
like
it
vail
came
forward
the
only
cool
one
of
the
four
do
be
a
fool
marsh
he
protested
come
to
bed
the
right
turner
turned
his
eyes
on
vail
and
they
were
as
full
of
danger
as
a
snake
you
go
to
hell
he
said
singleton
the
captain
d
hear
if
rich
if
richardson
gets
funny
put
him
in
irons
singleton
stood
up
with
a
sort
of
swagger
he
wes
less
intoxicated
than
turner
but
ugly
enough
he
faced
the
captain
with
a
leer
sorry
old
fellow
he
said
but
you
heard
what
turner
said
the
captain
drew
a
deep
breath
then
without
any
warning
he
leaned
across
the
table
and
shot
out
his
clenched
fist
it
took
the
mate
on
the
point
of
the
chin
and
he
folded
up
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
good
old
boy
muttered
burns
beside
me
good
old
boy
turner
picked
up
a
bottle
from
the
table
and
made
the
same
incoordinate
pass
with
it
at
the
captain
as
he
had
at
me
the
morning
before
with
his
magazine
the
captain
did
not
move
he
was
a
big
man
and
he
folded
his
arms
with
their
hairy
wrists
across
his
chest
turner
he
said
while
we
are
on
the
sea
i
am
in
command
here
you
know
that
well
enough
you
are
drunk
in
the
morning
you
will
be
sober
and
i
want
you
to
remember
what
i
am
going
to
say
if
you
interfere
again
with
me
or
my
officers
i
shall
put
you
in
irons
he
started
for
the
after
companionway
and
burns
and
i
hurried
forward
out
of
his
way
burns
to
the
lookout
i
to
make
the
round
of
the
after
house
and
bring
up
safe
from
detection
by
the
wheel
again
the
mate
was
in
a
chair
looking
sick
and
dazed
and
turner
and
vail
were
confronting
each
other
you
know
that
is
a
lie
vail
was
saying
she
is
faithful
to
you
as
far
as
i
know
although
i
damned
if
i
know
why
he
turned
to
the
mate
roughly
better
get
out
in
the
air
once
again
i
left
my
window
to
avoid
discovery
the
mate
walking
slowly
made
his
way
up
the
companionway
to
the
rail
the
man
at
the
wheel
reported
in
the
forecastle
when
he
came
down
at
the
end
of
his
watch
that
singleton
had
seemed
dazed
and
had
stood
leaning
against
the
rail
for
some
time
occasionally
cursing
to
himself
that
the
second
mate
had
come
on
deck
and
had
sent
him
to
bed
and
that
the
captain
was
shut
in
his
cabin
with
the
light
going
there
was
much
discussion
of
the
incident
among
the
crew
sympathy
was
with
the
captain
and
there
was
a
general
feeling
that
the
end
had
not
come
charlie
jones
reading
his
bible
on
the
edge
of
his
bunk
voiced
the
general
belief
knowin
the
turners
hull
and
mast
he
said
and
having
sailed
with
captain
richardson
off
and
on
for
ten
years
the
chances
is
good
of
our
having
a
hell
of
a
time
it
ai
natural
anyhow
this
voyage
with
no
rats
in
the
hold
and
all
the
insects
killed
with
this
here
formaldehyde
and
sent
to
the
on
sundays
but
at
first
the
thing
seemed
smoothed
over
it
is
true
that
the
captain
did
not
speak
to
the
first
mate
except
when
compelled
to
and
that
turner
and
the
captain
ignored
each
other
elaborately
the
cruise
went
on
without
event
there
was
no
attempt
on
turner
part
to
carry
out
his
threat
of
the
night
before
nor
did
he
as
the
crew
had
prophesied
order
the
ella
into
the
nearest
port
he
kept
much
to
himself
spending
whole
days
below
with
williams
carrying
him
highballs
always
appearing
at
dinner
however
sodden
of
face
but
immaculately
dressed
and
eating
little
or
nothing
a
week
went
by
in
this
fashion
luring
us
all
to
security
i
was
still
lean
but
fairly
strong
again
vail
left
to
himself
or
to
the
women
of
the
party
took
to
talking
with
me
now
and
then
i
thought
he
was
uneasy
more
than
once
he
expressed
a
regret
that
he
had
taken
the
cruise
laying
his
discontent
to
the
long
inaction
but
the
real
reason
was
turner
jealousy
of
him
the
obsession
of
the
dipsomaniac
i
knew
it
and
vail
knew
that
i
knew
on
the
we
encountered
bad
weather
the
first
wind
of
the
cruise
all
hands
were
required
for
tacking
and
i
was
stationed
on
the
with
one
other
man
williams
the
butler
succumbed
to
the
weather
and
at
five
miss
lee
made
her
way
forward
through
the
driving
rain
and
asked
me
if
i
could
take
his
place
if
the
captain
needs
you
we
can
manage
she
said
we
have
henrietta
and
karen
the
two
maids
but
turner
prefers
a
man
to
serve
i
said
that
i
was
probably
not
so
useful
that
i
could
not
be
spared
and
that
i
would
try
vail
suggestion
had
come
back
to
me
and
this
was
my
chance
to
get
williams
keys
miss
lee
having
spoken
to
the
captain
i
was
relieved
from
duty
and
went
aft
with
her
what
with
the
plunging
of
the
vessel
and
the
slippery
decks
she
almost
fell
twice
and
each
time
i
caught
her
the
second
time
she
wrenched
her
ankle
and
stood
for
a
moment
holding
to
the
rail
while
i
waited
beside
her
she
wore
a
heavy
ulster
of
some
rough
material
and
a
small
soft
hat
of
the
same
material
pulled
over
her
ears
her
soft
hair
lay
wet
across
her
forehead
how
are
you
liking
the
sea
leslie
she
said
after
she
had
tested
her
ankle
and
found
the
damage
inconsiderable
very
much
miss
lee
do
you
intend
to
remain
a
a
sailor
i
am
not
a
sailor
i
am
a
deck
steward
and
i
am
about
to
become
a
butler
that
was
our
agreement
she
flashed
at
me
certainly
and
to
know
that
i
intend
to
fulfill
it
to
the
letter
i
have
only
to
show
this
it
had
been
one
of
mcwhirter
inspirations
on
learning
how
i
had
been
engaged
the
small
book
called
the
perfect
butler
i
took
it
from
the
pocket
of
my
flannel
shirt
under
my
oilskins
and
held
it
out
to
her
i
have
not
got
very
far
i
said
humbly
it
not
inspiring
reading
i
got
the
wine
glasses
straightened
out
but
it
seems
a
lot
of
fuss
about
nothing
wine
is
wine
is
it
what
difference
after
all
does
a
hollow
stem
or
green
glass
make
the
rain
was
beating
down
on
us
the
perfect
butler
was
weeping
tears
as
its
chart
of
choice
vintages
was
mixed
with
water
miss
lee
looked
up
smiling
from
the
book
you
prefer
jug
of
wine
she
said
old
omar
had
the
right
idea
only
i
imagine
literally
it
was
a
skin
of
wine
they
did
have
jugs
did
they
you
know
the
she
asked
slowly
i
know
the
jug
of
wine
and
loaf
of
bread
part
i
admitted
irritated
at
the
slip
in
my
home
city
they
using
it
to
advertise
a
particular
sort
of
bread
you
know
book
of
verses
underneath
the
bough
a
loaf
of
wiggin
bread
and
thou
in
spite
of
myself
in
spite
of
the
absurd
verse
of
the
pouring
rain
of
the
fact
that
i
was
shortly
to
place
her
dinner
before
her
in
the
capacity
of
upper
servant
i
thrilled
to
the
last
two
words
thou
i
repeated
she
looked
up
at
me
startled
and
for
a
second
our
glances
held
the
next
moment
she
was
gone
and
i
was
alone
on
a
rain
swept
deck
cursing
my
folly
that
night
in
a
white
linen
coat
i
served
dinner
in
the
after
house
the
meal
was
unusually
gay
rendered
so
by
the
pitching
of
the
boat
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
dishes
in
the
general
hilarity
my
awkwardness
went
unnoticed
miss
lee
sitting
beside
vail
devoted
herself
to
him
johns
young
and
blonde
tried
to
interest
turner
and
failing
in
that
took
to
watching
me
to
my
discomfiture
turner
with
apprehensive
eyes
on
her
husband
ate
little
and
drank
nothing
dinner
over
in
the
main
cabin
they
lounged
into
the
except
johns
who
following
them
to
the
door
closed
it
behind
them
and
came
back
she
held
a
lighted
cigarette
and
she
stood
just
outside
the
zone
of
candlelight
watching
me
through
narrowed
eyes
you
got
along
very
well
she
observed
are
you
quite
strong
again
quite
strong
mrs
johns
you
have
never
done
this
sort
of
thing
before
have
you
butler
work
no
but
it
is
rather
simple
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
she
said
i
seem
to
recall
you
vaguely
that
is
i
seem
to
remember
a
crowd
of
people
and
a
noise
i
dare
say
i
did
see
you
in
a
crowd
somewhere
you
know
you
are
rather
an
unforgettable
type
i
was
nonplused
as
to
how
a
butler
would
reply
to
such
a
statement
and
took
refuge
in
no
reply
at
all
as
it
happened
none
was
needed
the
ship
gave
a
terrific
roll
at
that
moment
and
i
just
saved
the
chartreuse
as
it
was
leaving
the
table
johns
was
holding
to
a
chair
well
caught
she
smiled
and
taking
a
fresh
cigarette
she
bent
over
a
and
lighted
it
herself
all
the
time
her
eyes
were
on
me
i
felt
that
she
was
studying
one
over
her
cigarette
with
something
in
view
is
it
still
raining
yes
mrs
johns
will
you
get
a
wrap
from
karen
and
bring
it
to
me
on
deck
i
i
want
air
the
forward
companionway
led
down
into
the
main
cabin
she
moved
toward
it
her
pale
green
gown
fading
into
the
shadow
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
she
turned
and
looked
back
at
me
i
had
been
stupid
enough
but
i
knew
then
that
she
had
something
to
say
to
me
something
that
she
would
not
trust
to
the
cabin
walls
i
got
the
wrap
she
was
sitting
in
a
when
i
found
her
on
the
lee
side
of
the
after
house
a
position
carefully
chosen
with
only
the
storeroom
windows
behind
i
gave
her
the
wrap
and
she
flung
it
over
her
without
rising
sit
down
leslie
she
said
pointing
to
the
chair
beside
her
and
as
i
hesitated
do
be
silly
boy
else
lee
and
her
sister
may
be
as
blind
as
they
like
you
are
not
a
sailor
or
a
butler
either
i
do
care
what
you
are
i
not
going
to
ask
any
questions
sit
down
i
have
to
talk
to
some
one
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
somewhat
uneasy
to
tell
the
truth
the
crew
were
about
on
a
night
like
that
and
at
any
moment
elsa
lee
might
avail
herself
of
the
dummy
hand
as
she
sometimes
did
and
run
up
for
a
breath
of
air
or
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
just
now
johns
i
said
i
am
one
of
the
crew
of
the
ella
and
if
i
am
seen
here
oh
fudge
she
retorted
impatiently
my
reputation
is
going
to
be
hurt
and
the
man
never
is
leslie
i
am
frightened
you
know
what
i
mean
turner
yes
you
mean
with
the
captain
with
any
one
who
happens
to
be
near
he
is
dangerous
it
is
vail
now
he
thinks
vail
is
in
love
with
his
wife
the
fact
is
that
vail
well
never
mind
about
that
the
point
is
this
this
afternoon
he
had
a
dispute
with
williams
and
knocked
him
down
the
other
women
do
know
it
vail
told
me
we
have
given
out
that
williams
is
seasick
it
will
be
vail
next
and
if
he
puts
a
hand
on
him
vail
will
kill
him
i
know
him
we
could
stop
this
drinking
and
have
him
shoot
up
the
ship
i
have
been
thinking
all
evening
and
only
one
thing
occurs
to
me
we
are
five
women
and
two
men
and
vail
refuses
to
be
alarmed
i
want
you
to
sleep
in
the
after
house
there
a
storeroom
where
you
could
put
a
cot
yes
i
agreed
and
i
do
it
of
course
if
you
are
uneasy
but
i
really
think
never
mind
what
you
really
think
i
have
slept
for
three
nights
and
i
showing
it
she
made
a
motion
to
rise
and
i
helped
her
up
she
was
a
tall
woman
and
before
i
knew
it
she
had
put
both
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
you
are
a
poor
butler
and
an
indifferent
sailor
i
believe
she
said
but
you
are
rather
a
dear
thank
you
she
left
me
alternately
uplifted
and
sheepish
but
that
night
i
took
a
blanket
and
a
pillow
into
the
storeroom
and
spread
my
six
feet
of
length
along
the
greatest
diameter
of
a
pantry
and
that
night
also
between
six
and
seven
bells
with
the
storm
subsided
and
only
a
moderate
sea
schwartz
the
second
mate
went
overboard
went
without
a
cry
without
a
sound
singleton
relieving
him
at
four
found
his
cap
lying
near
starboard
just
forward
of
the
after
house
the
helmsman
and
the
two
men
in
the
lookout
reported
no
sound
of
a
struggle
the
lookout
had
seen
the
light
of
his
cigar
on
the
at
six
bells
three
at
seven
bells
he
had
walked
back
to
the
helmsman
and
commented
cheerfully
on
the
break
in
the
weather
that
was
the
last
seen
of
him
the
alarm
was
raised
when
singleton
went
on
watch
at
four
the
ella
was
heaved
to
and
the
lee
boat
lowered
at
the
same
time
were
thrown
out
and
patent
lights
but
the
early
summer
dawn
revealed
a
calm
ocean
and
no
sign
of
the
missing
mate
at
ten
the
order
was
reluctantly
given
to
go
on
chapter
v
a
terrible
night
with
the
disappearance
of
schwartz
the
ella
was
i
believe
captain
richardson
made
an
attempt
to
secure
me
to
take
the
place
of
burns
now
moved
up
into
schwartz
position
but
the
attempt
met
with
a
surly
refusal
from
turner
the
crew
was
plainly
nervous
and
irritable
sailors
are
men
as
a
rule
their
mental
processes
are
elemental
they
began
to
mutter
that
the
of
the
turner
line
was
at
her
tricks
again
that
afternoon
going
into
the
forecastle
for
some
of
my
clothing
i
found
a
curious
group
gathered
about
the
table
were
tom
the
mulatto
cook
a
swede
named
oleson
adams
and
burns
of
the
crew
at
the
head
of
the
table
charlie
jones
was
reading
the
service
for
the
burial
of
the
dead
at
sea
the
men
were
standing
bareheaded
i
took
off
my
cap
and
stood
just
inside
the
door
until
the
simple
service
was
over
i
was
strongly
moved
schwartz
disappeared
in
the
early
morning
of
august
and
now
i
come
not
without
misgiving
to
the
night
of
august
i
am
wondering
if
after
all
i
have
made
clear
the
picture
that
is
before
my
eyes
the
languid
cruise
the
slight
relaxation
of
discipline
due
to
the
leisure
of
a
pleasure
voyage
the
ella
again
rolling
gently
with
hardly
a
dash
of
spray
to
show
that
she
was
moving
the
sun
beating
down
on
her
white
decks
and
white
canvas
on
the
three
women
in
summer
attire
on
with
its
accompaniment
of
tall
glasses
filled
with
ice
on
turner
morose
face
and
vail
watchful
one
in
the
forecastle
much
gossip
and
not
a
little
fear
and
in
the
forward
house
where
captain
richardson
and
singleton
had
their
quarters
veiled
hostility
and
sullen
silence
august
was
tuesday
a
hot
august
day
with
only
enough
air
going
to
keep
our
sails
filled
at
five
i
served
afternoon
tea
and
shortly
after
i
went
to
williams
cabin
in
the
forward
house
to
dress
the
wound
in
his
head
a
long
cut
which
was
now
healing
i
passed
the
captain
cabin
and
heard
him
quarreling
with
the
first
mate
who
was
replying
now
and
then
sullenly
only
the
tones
of
their
voices
reached
me
when
i
had
finished
with
williams
and
was
returning
the
quarrel
was
still
going
on
their
voices
ceased
as
i
passed
the
door
and
there
was
a
crash
as
of
a
chair
violently
overturned
the
next
bit
i
heard
put
that
down
the
captain
roared
i
listened
uncertain
whether
to
break
in
or
not
the
next
moment
singleton
opened
the
door
and
saw
me
i
went
on
as
if
i
had
heard
nothing
beyond
that
the
day
was
much
as
other
days
turner
ate
no
dinner
that
night
he
was
pale
and
twitching
even
with
my
small
experience
i
knew
he
was
on
the
verge
of
delirium
tremens
he
did
not
play
cards
and
spent
much
of
the
evening
wandering
restlessly
about
on
deck
turner
retired
early
johns
played
accompaniments
for
vail
to
sing
to
in
the
until
something
after
eleven
when
they
too
went
to
their
rooms
it
being
impracticable
for
me
to
go
to
my
quarters
in
the
storeroom
until
the
after
house
was
settled
i
went
up
on
deck
miss
lee
had
her
arm
through
turner
and
was
talking
to
him
he
seemed
to
be
listening
to
her
but
at
last
he
stopped
and
freed
his
arm
not
ungently
that
all
sounds
very
well
elsa
he
said
but
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
know
this
i
not
a
fool
or
blind
he
lurched
down
the
companionway
and
into
the
cabin
i
heard
her
draw
a
long
breath
then
she
turned
and
saw
me
is
that
you
leslie
yes
miss
lee
she
came
toward
me
the
train
of
her
soft
white
gown
over
her
arm
and
the
light
from
a
lantern
setting
some
jewels
on
her
neck
to
glittering
johns
has
told
me
where
you
are
sleeping
you
are
very
good
to
do
it
although
i
think
she
is
rather
absurd
i
am
glad
to
do
anything
i
can
i
am
sure
of
that
you
are
certain
you
are
comfortable
there
perfectly
then
and
thank
you
unexpectedly
she
put
out
her
hand
and
i
took
it
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
touched
her
and
it
went
to
my
head
i
bent
over
her
slim
cold
fingers
and
kissed
them
she
drew
her
breath
in
sharply
in
surprise
but
as
i
dropped
her
hand
our
eyes
met
you
should
not
have
done
that
she
said
coolly
i
am
sorry
she
left
me
utterly
wretched
what
a
boor
she
must
have
thought
me
to
misconstrue
her
simple
act
of
kindness
i
loathed
myself
with
a
hatred
that
sent
me
groveling
to
my
blanket
in
the
pantry
and
that
kept
me
once
there
awake
through
all
the
early
part
of
the
summer
night
i
wakened
with
a
sense
of
oppression
of
smothering
heat
i
had
struggled
slowly
back
to
consciousness
to
realize
that
the
door
of
the
pantry
was
closed
and
that
i
was
stewing
in
the
moist
heat
of
the
august
night
i
got
up
clad
in
my
shirt
and
trousers
and
felt
my
way
to
the
door
the
storeroom
and
pantry
of
the
after
house
had
been
built
in
during
the
rehabilitation
of
the
boat
and
consisted
of
a
short
passageway
with
drawers
for
linens
on
either
side
and
beyond
lighted
by
a
porthole
the
small
supply
room
in
which
i
had
been
sleeping
along
this
passageway
then
i
groped
my
way
to
the
door
at
the
end
opening
into
the
main
cabin
near
the
door
and
across
from
turner
room
this
door
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
leaving
open
for
two
purposes
ventilation
and
in
case
i
might
be
as
johns
had
feared
required
in
the
night
the
door
was
locked
on
the
outside
i
was
a
moment
or
two
in
grasping
the
fact
i
shook
it
carefully
to
see
if
it
had
merely
caught
and
then
incredulous
i
put
my
weight
to
it
it
refused
to
yield
the
silence
outside
was
absolute
i
felt
my
way
back
to
the
window
it
was
open
but
was
barred
with
iron
and
even
without
that
too
small
for
my
shoulders
i
listened
for
the
mate
it
was
still
dark
and
so
not
yet
time
for
the
watch
to
change
singleton
would
be
on
duty
and
he
rarely
came
aft
there
was
no
sound
of
footsteps
i
lit
a
match
and
examined
the
lock
it
was
a
simple
one
and
as
my
idea
now
was
to
free
myself
without
raising
an
alarm
i
decided
to
unscrew
it
with
my
i
was
still
confused
but
inclined
to
consider
my
imprisonment
a
jest
perhaps
on
the
part
of
charlie
jones
who
tempered
his
religious
fervor
with
a
fondness
for
practical
joking
i
accordingly
knelt
in
front
of
the
lock
and
opened
my
knife
i
was
in
darkness
and
working
by
touch
i
had
extracted
one
screw
and
with
a
growing
sense
of
satisfaction
was
putting
it
in
my
pocket
before
loosening
a
second
when
a
board
on
which
i
knelt
moved
under
my
knee
lifted
as
if
the
other
end
beyond
the
door
had
been
stepped
on
there
was
no
sound
no
creak
merely
that
ominous
lifting
under
my
knee
there
was
some
one
just
beyond
the
door
a
moment
later
the
pressure
was
released
with
a
growing
horror
of
i
know
not
what
i
set
to
work
at
the
second
screw
trying
to
be
noiseless
but
with
hands
shaking
with
excitement
the
screw
fell
out
into
my
palm
in
my
haste
i
dropped
my
knife
and
had
to
grope
for
it
on
the
floor
it
was
then
that
a
woman
screamed
a
low
sobbing
cry
broken
off
almost
before
it
began
i
had
got
my
knife
by
that
time
and
in
desperation
i
threw
myself
against
the
door
it
gave
way
and
i
fell
full
length
on
the
main
cabin
floor
i
was
still
in
darkness
the
silence
in
the
cabin
was
absolute
i
could
hear
the
steersman
beyond
the
scratching
a
match
as
i
got
up
six
bells
struck
it
was
three
vail
room
was
next
to
the
pantry
and
forward
i
felt
my
way
to
it
and
rapped
vail
i
called
vail
his
door
was
open
an
inch
or
so
i
went
in
and
felt
my
way
to
his
bunk
i
could
hear
him
breathing
a
stertorous
respiration
like
that
of
sleep
and
yet
unlike
the
moment
i
touched
him
the
sound
ceased
and
did
not
commence
again
i
struck
a
match
and
bent
over
him
he
had
been
almost
cut
to
pieces
with
an
axe
chapter
vi
in
the
after
house
the
match
burnt
out
and
i
dropped
it
i
remember
mechanically
extinguishing
the
glowing
end
with
my
heel
and
then
straightening
to
such
a
sense
of
horror
as
i
have
never
felt
before
or
since
i
groped
for
the
door
i
wanted
air
space
the
freedom
from
lurking
death
of
the
open
deck
i
had
been
sleeping
with
my
revolver
beside
me
on
the
pantry
floor
somehow
or
other
i
got
back
there
and
found
it
i
made
an
attempt
to
find
the
switch
for
the
cabin
lights
and
failing
revolver
in
hand
i
ran
into
the
and
up
the
after
companionway
charlie
jones
was
at
the
wheel
and
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
i
saw
that
he
was
bending
to
the
right
peering
in
at
the
chartroom
window
he
turned
when
he
heard
me
what
wrong
he
asked
i
heard
a
yell
a
minute
ago
turner
on
the
rampage
he
saw
my
revolver
then
and
letting
go
the
wheel
threw
up
both
his
hands
turn
that
gun
away
you
fool
i
could
hardly
speak
i
lowered
the
revolver
and
gasped
call
the
captain
vail
been
murdered
good
god
he
said
who
did
it
he
had
taken
the
wheel
again
and
was
bringing
the
ship
back
to
her
course
i
was
turning
sick
and
dizzy
and
i
clutched
at
the
railing
of
the
companionway
i
do
know
where
the
captain
the
mate
around
he
raised
his
voice
mr
singleton
he
called
there
was
no
time
to
lose
i
felt
my
nausea
had
left
me
i
ran
forward
to
where
i
could
dimly
see
singleton
looking
in
my
direction
singleton
quick
i
called
bring
your
revolver
he
stopped
and
peered
in
my
direction
who
is
it
leslie
come
below
for
god
sake
he
came
slowly
toward
me
and
in
a
dozen
words
i
told
him
what
had
happened
i
saw
then
that
he
had
been
drinking
he
reeled
against
me
and
seemed
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
get
your
revolver
i
said
and
wake
the
captain
he
disappeared
into
the
forward
house
to
come
back
a
moment
later
with
a
revolver
i
had
got
a
lantern
in
the
mean
time
and
ran
to
the
forward
companionway
which
led
into
the
main
cabin
singleton
followed
me
where
the
captain
i
asked
i
did
call
him
singleton
replied
and
muttered
something
unintelligible
under
his
breath
swinging
the
lantern
ahead
of
me
i
led
the
way
down
the
companionway
something
lay
huddled
at
the
foot
i
had
to
step
over
it
to
get
down
singleton
stood
above
on
the
steps
i
stooped
and
held
the
lantern
close
and
we
both
saw
that
it
was
the
captain
killed
as
vail
had
been
he
was
fully
dressed
except
for
his
coat
and
as
he
lay
on
his
back
his
cap
had
been
placed
over
his
mutilated
face
i
thought
i
heard
something
moving
behind
me
in
the
cabin
and
wheeled
sharply
holding
my
revolver
leveled
the
idea
had
come
to
me
that
the
crew
had
mutinied
and
that
every
one
in
the
after
house
had
been
killed
the
idea
made
me
frantic
i
thought
of
the
women
of
elsa
lee
and
i
was
ready
to
kill
where
is
the
light
switch
i
demanded
of
singleton
who
was
still
on
the
companion
steps
swaying
i
do
know
he
said
and
collapsed
sitting
huddled
just
above
the
captain
body
with
his
face
in
his
hands
i
saw
i
need
not
look
to
him
for
help
and
i
succeeded
in
turning
on
the
light
in
the
swinging
lamp
in
the
center
of
the
cabin
there
was
no
sign
of
any
struggle
and
the
cabin
was
empty
i
went
back
to
the
captain
body
and
threw
a
rug
over
it
then
i
reached
over
and
shook
singleton
by
the
arm
do
something
i
raved
call
the
crew
get
somebody
here
you
drunken
fool
he
rose
and
staggered
up
the
companionway
and
i
ran
to
miss
door
it
was
closed
and
locked
as
were
all
the
others
except
and
the
one
i
had
broken
open
i
reached
turner
door
last
it
was
locked
and
i
got
no
response
to
my
knock
i
remembered
that
his
room
and
vail
connected
through
a
bath
and
still
holding
my
revolver
leveled
i
ran
into
vail
room
again
this
time
turning
on
the
light
a
night
light
was
burning
in
the
and
the
door
beyond
was
unlocked
i
flung
it
open
and
stepped
in
turner
was
lying
on
his
bed
fully
dressed
and
at
first
i
thought
he
too
had
been
murdered
but
he
was
in
a
drunken
stupor
he
sat
up
dazed
when
i
shook
him
by
the
arm
mr
turner
i
cried
try
to
rouse
yourself
man
the
captain
has
been
murdered
and
mr
vail
he
made
an
effort
to
sit
up
swayed
and
fell
back
again
his
face
was
swollen
and
purplish
his
eyes
congested
he
made
an
effort
to
speak
but
failed
to
be
intelligible
i
had
no
time
to
waste
somewhere
on
the
ella
the
murderer
was
loose
he
must
be
found
i
flung
out
of
turner
cabin
as
the
crew
gathered
from
the
forecastle
and
from
the
decks
crowded
down
the
forward
companionway
i
ran
my
eye
over
them
every
man
was
there
singleton
below
by
the
captain
body
the
crew
silent
and
grouped
on
the
steps
clarke
mcnamara
burns
oleson
and
adams
behind
the
crew
charlie
jones
had
left
the
wheel
and
stood
peering
down
until
sharply
ordered
back
williams
with
a
bandage
on
his
head
and
tom
the
mulatto
cook
were
in
the
group
i
stood
revolver
in
hand
staring
at
the
men
among
them
i
felt
sure
was
the
murderer
but
which
one
all
were
equally
pale
equally
terrified
boys
i
said
vail
and
your
captain
have
been
murdered
the
murderer
must
be
on
the
ship
one
of
ourselves
there
was
a
murmur
at
that
singleton
i
suggest
that
these
men
stay
together
in
a
body
and
that
no
one
be
allowed
to
go
below
until
all
have
been
searched
and
all
weapons
taken
from
them
singleton
had
dropped
into
a
chair
and
sat
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
his
back
to
the
captain
body
he
looked
up
without
moving
and
his
face
was
gray
all
right
he
said
do
as
you
like
i
sick
he
looked
sick
burns
who
had
taken
schwartz
place
as
second
mate
left
the
group
and
came
toward
me
we
better
waken
the
women
he
said
if
you
tell
them
leslie
i
take
the
crew
on
deck
and
keep
them
there
singleton
seemed
dazed
and
when
burns
spoke
of
taking
the
men
on
deck
he
got
up
dizzily
i
going
too
he
muttered
i
go
crazy
if
i
stay
down
here
with
that
the
rug
had
been
drawn
back
to
show
the
crew
what
had
happened
i
drew
it
reverently
over
the
body
again
after
the
men
had
gone
i
knocked
at
turner
door
it
was
some
time
before
she
roused
when
she
answered
her
voice
was
startled
what
is
it
it
leslie
turner
will
you
come
to
the
door
in
a
moment
she
threw
on
a
and
opened
the
door
what
is
wrong
i
told
her
as
gently
as
i
could
i
thought
she
would
faint
but
she
pulled
herself
together
and
looked
past
me
into
the
cabin
that
is
the
captain
mrs
turner
and
mr
vail
in
his
cabin
where
is
mr
turner
in
his
cabin
asleep
she
looked
at
me
strangely
and
leaving
the
door
went
into
her
sister
room
next
i
heard
miss
lee
low
cry
of
horror
and
almost
immediately
the
two
women
came
to
the
doorway
have
you
seen
mr
turner
miss
lee
demanded
just
now
has
johns
been
told
not
yet
she
went
herself
to
johns
cabin
and
knocked
she
got
an
immediate
answer
and
johns
partly
dressed
opened
the
door
what
the
matter
she
demanded
the
whole
crew
is
tramping
outside
my
windows
i
hope
we
have
struck
an
iceberg
adele
do
faint
please
something
awful
has
happened
turner
he
has
killed
some
one
finally
hush
for
heaven
sake
wilmer
has
been
murdered
adele
and
the
captain
johns
had
less
control
than
the
other
women
she
stood
for
an
instant
with
a
sort
of
horrible
grin
on
her
face
then
she
went
down
on
the
floor
full
length
with
a
crash
elsa
lee
knelt
beside
her
and
slid
a
pillow
under
her
head
call
the
maids
leslie
she
said
quietly
karen
has
something
for
this
sort
of
thing
tell
her
to
bring
it
quickly
i
went
the
length
of
the
cabin
and
into
the
chartroom
the
maids
room
was
here
on
the
and
thus
aft
of
turner
and
miss
lee
rooms
it
had
one
door
only
and
two
small
barred
windows
one
above
each
of
the
two
bunks
i
turned
on
the
lights
at
the
top
of
the
after
companionway
the
crew
had
been
assembled
and
burns
was
haranguing
them
i
knocked
at
the
maids
door
and
finding
it
unlocked
opened
it
an
inch
or
so
karen
i
called
and
receiving
no
answer
mrs
sloane
the
stewardess
i
opened
the
door
wide
and
glanced
in
karen
hansen
the
maid
was
on
the
floor
dead
the
stewardess
in
collapse
from
terror
was
in
her
bunk
uninjured
chapter
vii
we
find
the
axe
i
went
to
the
after
companionway
and
called
up
to
the
men
to
send
the
first
mate
down
but
burns
came
instead
singleton
sick
he
explained
he
up
there
in
a
corner
with
oleson
and
mcnamara
holding
him
burns
i
said
cautiously
i
found
another
god
not
one
of
the
women
one
of
the
maids
karen
burns
was
a
young
fellow
about
my
own
age
and
to
this
point
he
had
stood
up
well
but
he
had
been
having
a
sort
of
flirtation
with
the
girl
and
i
saw
him
go
sick
with
horror
he
wanted
to
see
her
when
he
had
got
command
of
himself
but
i
would
not
let
him
enter
the
room
he
stood
outside
while
i
went
in
and
carried
out
the
stewardess
who
was
coming
to
and
moaning
i
took
her
forward
and
told
the
three
women
there
what
i
had
found
johns
was
better
and
i
found
them
all
huddled
in
her
room
i
put
the
stewardess
on
the
bed
and
locked
the
door
into
the
next
room
then
after
examining
the
window
i
gave
elsa
lee
my
revolver
do
let
any
one
in
i
said
i
put
a
guard
at
the
two
companionways
and
we
let
no
one
down
but
keep
the
door
locked
also
she
took
the
revolver
from
me
and
examined
it
with
the
air
of
one
familiar
with
firearms
then
she
looked
up
at
me
her
lips
as
white
as
her
face
we
are
relying
on
you
leslie
she
said
and
at
her
words
the
storm
of
and
bitterness
that
i
had
been
holding
in
abeyance
for
the
last
half
hour
swept
over
me
like
a
flood
i
could
have
wept
for
fury
why
should
you
trust
me
i
demanded
i
slept
through
the
time
when
i
was
needed
and
when
i
wakened
and
found
myself
locked
in
the
storeroom
i
waited
to
take
the
lock
off
instead
of
breaking
down
the
door
i
ought
to
jump
overboard
we
are
relying
on
you
she
said
again
simply
and
i
heard
her
fasten
the
door
behind
me
as
i
went
out
dawn
was
coming
as
i
joined
the
crew
huddled
around
the
wheel
there
were
nine
men
counting
singleton
but
singleton
hardly
counted
he
was
in
a
state
of
profound
mental
and
physical
collapse
the
ella
was
without
an
accredited
officer
and
for
lack
of
orders
to
the
contrary
the
helmsman
mcnamara
now
was
holding
her
to
her
course
burns
had
taken
schwartz
place
as
second
mate
but
the
situation
was
clearly
beyond
him
turner
condition
was
known
and
frankly
discussed
it
was
clear
that
for
a
time
at
least
we
would
have
to
get
along
without
him
charlie
jones
always
an
influence
among
the
men
voiced
the
situation
as
we
all
stood
together
in
the
chill
morning
air
what
we
want
to
do
boys
he
said
is
to
make
for
the
nearest
port
this
here
is
a
police
matter
and
a
hanging
matter
someone
else
put
in
we
got
to
remember
boys
that
this
ai
like
a
crime
on
land
we
got
the
fellow
that
did
it
he
on
the
boat
all
right
there
was
a
stirring
among
the
men
and
some
of
them
looked
aft
to
where
guarded
by
the
swede
oleson
singleton
was
sitting
his
head
in
his
hands
and
what
more
charlie
jones
went
on
i
for
putting
leslie
here
in
charge
for
now
anyhow
that
agreeable
to
you
is
it
burns
but
i
do
know
anything
about
a
ship
i
objected
i
willing
enough
but
i
not
competent
i
believe
the
thing
had
been
discussed
before
i
went
up
for
mcnamara
spoke
up
from
the
wheel
we
manage
that
somehow
or
other
leslie
he
said
we
want
somebody
to
take
charge
somebody
with
a
head
that
all
and
since
you
ai
in
a
manner
of
speaking
been
one
of
us
nobody
feelings
ca
be
hurt
ai
that
it
boys
that
and
a
matter
of
brains
said
burns
but
singleton
i
glanced
aft
singleton
is
going
in
irons
was
the
reply
i
got
the
light
was
stronger
now
and
i
could
see
their
faces
it
was
clear
that
the
crew
or
a
majority
of
the
crew
believed
him
guilty
and
that
as
far
as
singleton
was
concerned
my
authority
did
not
exist
all
right
i
said
i
do
the
best
i
can
first
of
all
i
want
every
man
to
give
up
his
weapons
burns
aye
aye
go
over
each
man
leave
them
their
take
everything
else
the
men
lined
up
the
situation
was
tense
horrible
so
that
the
miscellaneous
articles
from
their
pockets
knives
keys
plugs
of
chewing
tobacco
and
here
and
there
among
the
foreign
ones
small
combs
for
beard
and
mustache
unexpectedly
brought
to
light
caused
a
smile
of
pure
reaction
two
revolvers
from
oleson
and
mcnamara
and
one
nicked
razor
from
adams
completed
the
list
of
weapons
we
found
the
crew
submitted
willingly
they
seemed
relieved
to
have
some
one
to
direct
them
and
the
alacrity
with
which
they
obeyed
my
orders
showed
how
they
were
suffering
under
the
strain
of
inaction
i
went
over
to
singleton
and
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
sorry
singleton
i
said
but
i
have
to
ask
you
for
your
revolver
without
looking
at
me
he
drew
it
from
his
hip
pocket
and
held
it
out
i
took
it
it
was
loaded
it
out
of
order
he
said
briefly
if
it
had
been
working
right
i
would
be
here
i
reached
down
and
touched
his
wrist
his
pulse
was
slow
and
rather
faint
his
hands
cold
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
yes
he
snarled
you
can
get
me
a
and
let
me
at
those
fools
over
there
turner
did
this
and
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
i
slid
his
revolver
into
my
pocket
and
went
back
to
the
men
counting
williams
and
the
cook
and
myself
there
were
nine
of
us
the
cook
i
counted
out
ordering
him
to
go
to
the
galley
and
prepare
breakfast
the
eight
that
were
left
i
divided
into
two
watches
burns
taking
one
and
i
the
other
on
burns
watch
were
clarke
mcnamara
and
williams
on
mine
oleson
adams
and
charlie
jones
it
was
two
bells
or
five
burns
struck
the
gong
sharply
as
an
indication
that
order
of
a
sort
had
been
restored
the
rising
sun
was
gleaming
on
the
sails
the
gray
surface
of
the
sea
was
ruffling
under
the
morning
breeze
from
the
galley
a
thin
stream
of
smoke
was
rising
some
of
the
horror
of
the
night
went
with
the
darkness
but
the
thought
of
what
waited
in
the
cabin
below
was
on
us
all
i
suggested
another
attempt
to
rouse
turner
and
burns
and
clarke
went
below
they
came
back
in
ten
minutes
reporting
no
change
in
turner
condition
there
was
open
grumbling
among
the
men
at
the
situation
but
we
were
helpless
burns
and
i
decided
to
go
on
as
if
turner
were
not
on
board
until
he
was
in
condition
to
take
hold
we
thought
it
best
to
bring
up
the
bodies
while
all
the
crew
was
on
duty
and
then
to
take
up
the
watches
i
arranged
to
have
one
man
constantly
on
guard
in
the
after
house
a
difficult
matter
where
all
were
under
suspicion
burns
suggested
charlie
jones
as
probably
the
most
reliable
and
i
gave
him
the
revolver
i
had
taken
from
singleton
it
was
useless
but
it
made
at
least
a
show
of
authority
the
rest
of
the
crew
except
oleson
on
guard
over
the
mate
was
detailed
to
assist
in
carrying
up
the
three
bodies
williams
was
taken
along
to
get
sheets
from
the
linen
room
we
brought
the
captain
up
first
laying
him
on
a
sheet
on
the
deck
and
folding
the
edges
over
him
it
was
terrible
work
even
i
fresh
from
a
medical
college
grew
nauseated
over
it
he
was
heavy
it
was
slow
work
getting
him
up
vail
we
brought
up
in
the
sheets
from
his
bunk
of
the
three
he
was
the
most
mutilated
the
maid
karen
showed
only
one
injury
a
smashing
blow
on
the
head
probably
from
the
head
of
the
axe
for
axe
it
had
been
beyond
a
doubt
i
put
williams
to
work
below
to
clear
away
every
evidence
of
what
had
happened
he
went
down
only
to
rush
up
again
refusing
to
stay
alone
i
sent
clarke
with
him
and
instructed
charlie
jones
to
keep
them
there
until
the
cabin
was
in
order
at
three
bells
the
cook
brought
coffee
and
some
of
the
men
took
it
i
tried
to
swallow
but
it
choked
me
burns
had
served
as
second
mate
on
a
sailing
vessel
and
thought
he
could
take
us
back
at
least
into
more
traveled
waters
we
decided
to
head
back
to
new
york
i
got
the
code
book
from
the
captain
cabin
and
we
agreed
to
run
up
the
flag
union
down
if
any
other
vessel
came
in
sight
i
got
the
code
word
for
mutiny
need
assistance
and
i
asked
the
mate
if
he
would
signal
if
a
vessel
came
near
enough
but
he
turned
sullen
and
refused
to
answer
i
find
it
hard
to
recap
calmly
the
events
of
that
morning
the
three
still
and
shrouded
figures
prone
on
deck
the
crew
bareheaded
standing
around
eyeing
each
other
stealthily
with
panic
ready
to
leap
free
and
grip
each
of
them
by
the
throat
the
grim
determination
the
reason
for
which
i
did
not
yet
know
to
put
the
first
mate
in
irons
and
over
all
the
clear
sunrise
of
an
august
morning
on
the
ocean
rails
and
decks
gleaming
an
odor
of
coffee
in
the
air
the
joyous
lift
and
splash
of
the
bowsprit
as
the
ella
headed
back
on
her
course
seemed
to
make
for
home
like
a
nag
for
the
stable
surely
none
of
these
men
some
weeping
all
grieving
could
be
the
fiend
who
had
committed
the
crimes
one
by
one
i
looked
in
their
faces
at
burns
youngest
member
of
the
crew
a
scot
at
clarke
and
adams
and
charlie
jones
old
in
the
service
of
the
turner
line
at
mcnamara
a
shrewd
little
irishman
at
oleson
the
swede
and
in
spite
of
myself
i
could
not
help
comparing
them
with
the
man
below
in
his
cabin
the
owner
of
the
ship
one
explanation
came
to
me
and
i
leaped
at
it
the
possibility
of
a
stowaway
hidden
in
the
hold
some
maniacal
fugitive
who
had
found
in
the
little
cargo
boat
empty
hull
ample
room
to
hide
the
men
too
seized
at
the
idea
one
and
all
volunteered
for
what
might
prove
to
be
a
dangerous
service
i
chose
charlie
jones
and
clarke
as
being
most
familiar
with
the
ship
and
we
went
down
into
the
hold
clarke
carried
a
lantern
charlie
jones
held
singleton
broken
revolver
i
carried
a
belaying
pin
but
although
we
searched
every
foot
of
space
we
found
nothing
the
formaldehyde
with
which
turner
had
fumigated
the
ship
clung
here
tenaciously
and
mixed
with
the
odors
of
bilge
water
and
the
indescribable
heavy
smells
left
by
tropical
cargoes
made
me
dizzy
and
we
were
stumbling
along
clarke
with
the
lantern
i
next
and
charlie
jones
behind
on
our
way
to
the
ladder
again
when
i
received
a
stunning
blow
on
the
back
of
the
head
i
turned
dizzy
expecting
nothing
less
than
sudden
death
when
it
developed
that
jones
having
stumbled
over
a
loose
plank
had
fallen
forward
the
revolver
in
his
outstretched
hand
striking
my
head
he
picked
himself
up
sheepishly
and
we
went
on
but
so
unnerved
was
i
by
this
fresh
shock
that
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
i
could
essay
the
ladder
burns
was
waiting
at
the
hatchway
peering
down
beside
him
on
the
deck
lay
a
bloodstained
axe
elsa
lee
on
hearing
the
story
of
henrietta
sloane
had
gone
to
the
maids
cabin
and
had
found
it
where
it
had
been
flung
into
the
berth
of
the
stewardess
chapter
viii
the
stewardess
story
but
after
all
the
story
of
henrietta
sloane
only
added
to
the
mystery
she
told
it
to
me
sitting
propped
in
a
chair
in
room
her
face
white
her
lips
dry
and
twitching
the
crew
were
making
such
breakfast
as
they
could
on
deck
and
turner
was
still
in
a
stupor
in
his
room
across
the
main
cabin
the
four
women
drawn
together
in
their
distress
were
huddled
in
the
center
of
the
room
touching
hands
now
and
then
as
if
finding
comfort
in
contact
and
reassurance
i
went
to
bed
early
said
the
stewardess
about
ten
i
think
karen
had
not
come
down
i
wakened
when
the
watch
changed
it
was
hot
and
the
window
from
our
room
to
the
deck
was
open
there
is
a
curtain
over
it
to
keep
the
helmsman
from
looking
in
it
is
close
to
the
wheel
the
bell
striking
every
does
not
waken
me
any
more
although
it
did
at
first
it
is
just
outside
the
window
but
i
heard
the
watch
change
i
heard
eight
bells
struck
and
the
lookout
man
on
the
forecastle
head
call
well
i
sat
up
and
turned
on
the
lights
karen
had
not
come
down
and
i
was
alarmed
she
had
been
had
been
flirting
a
little
with
one
of
the
sailors
and
i
had
warned
her
that
it
would
not
do
she
be
found
out
and
get
into
trouble
the
only
way
to
reach
our
cabin
was
through
the
and
when
i
opened
the
door
an
inch
or
two
i
saw
why
karen
had
not
come
down
turner
and
singleton
were
sitting
there
they
were
she
hesitated
please
go
on
said
turner
they
were
drinking
yes
turner
and
vail
was
there
too
he
was
saying
that
the
captain
would
come
down
and
there
would
be
more
trouble
i
shut
the
door
and
stood
just
inside
listening
singleton
said
he
hoped
the
captain
would
come
that
he
and
turner
only
wanted
a
chance
to
get
at
him
miss
lee
leaned
forward
and
searched
the
stewardess
face
with
strained
eyes
you
are
sure
that
he
mentioned
turner
in
that
that
was
exactly
what
he
said
miss
lee
the
captain
came
down
just
then
and
ordered
singleton
on
deck
i
think
he
went
for
i
did
not
hear
his
voice
again
i
thought
from
the
sounds
that
vail
and
the
captain
were
trying
to
get
turner
to
his
room
johns
had
been
sitting
back
her
eyes
shut
holding
a
bottle
of
salts
to
her
nose
now
she
looked
up
my
dear
woman
she
said
are
you
trying
to
tell
us
that
we
slept
through
all
that
if
you
did
not
hear
it
you
must
have
slept
the
stewardess
persisted
obstinately
the
door
into
the
main
cabin
was
closed
karen
came
down
just
after
she
was
frightened
she
said
the
first
mate
was
on
deck
in
a
terrible
humor
and
that
charlie
jones
who
was
at
the
wheel
had
appealed
to
burns
not
to
leave
him
there
that
trouble
was
coming
that
must
have
been
at
twelve
the
bell
struck
as
she
put
out
the
light
we
both
went
to
sleep
then
until
turner
ringing
for
karen
roused
us
but
i
did
not
ring
for
karen
the
woman
stared
at
turner
but
the
bell
rang
turner
karen
got
up
at
once
and
turning
on
the
light
looked
at
the
clock
do
you
think
of
that
she
said
minutes
to
three
and
i
just
got
to
sleep
i
growled
about
the
light
and
she
put
it
out
after
she
had
thrown
on
a
wrapper
the
room
was
dark
when
she
opened
the
door
there
was
a
little
light
in
the
from
the
binnacle
lantern
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
companionway
was
always
closed
at
night
the
light
came
through
the
window
near
the
wheel
she
had
kept
up
very
well
to
this
point
telling
her
story
calmly
and
keeping
her
voice
down
but
when
she
reached
the
actual
killing
of
the
danish
maid
she
went
to
pieces
she
took
to
shivering
violently
and
her
pulse
under
my
fingers
was
small
and
rapid
i
mixed
some
aromatic
spirits
with
water
and
gave
it
to
her
and
we
waited
until
she
could
go
on
for
the
first
time
then
i
realized
that
i
was
clad
only
in
shirt
and
trousers
with
a
handkerchief
around
my
head
where
the
accident
in
the
hold
had
left
me
with
a
nasty
cut
my
bare
feet
were
thrust
into
slippers
i
saw
miss
lee
eyes
on
me
and
colored
i
had
forgotten
i
said
uncomfortably
i
have
time
to
find
my
coat
while
she
is
recovering
i
have
been
so
occupied
do
be
a
fool
johns
said
brusquely
no
one
cares
how
you
look
we
only
thank
heaven
you
are
alive
to
look
after
us
do
you
know
what
we
have
been
doing
locked
in
down
here
we
have
been
please
adele
said
elsa
lee
and
johns
shrugging
her
shoulders
went
back
to
her
salts
the
rest
of
the
story
we
got
slowly
briefly
it
was
this
karen
having
made
her
protest
at
being
called
at
such
an
hour
had
put
on
a
wrapper
and
pinned
up
her
hair
the
light
was
on
the
stewardess
said
she
heard
a
curious
chopping
sound
in
the
main
cabin
followed
by
a
fall
and
called
karen
attention
to
it
the
maid
impatient
and
drowsy
had
said
it
was
probably
turner
falling
over
something
and
that
she
hoped
she
would
not
meet
him
once
or
twice
when
he
had
been
drinking
he
had
made
overtures
to
her
and
she
detested
him
the
sound
outside
ceased
it
was
about
five
minutes
since
the
bell
had
rung
and
karen
yawned
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
i
let
her
ring
again
she
said
if
she
gets
in
the
habit
of
this
sort
of
thing
going
to
leave
the
stewardess
asked
her
to
put
out
the
light
and
let
her
sleep
and
karen
did
so
the
two
women
were
in
darkness
and
the
stewardess
dozed
for
a
minute
only
she
was
awakened
by
karen
touching
her
on
the
shoulder
and
whispering
close
to
her
ear
that
beast
is
out
there
she
said
i
peered
out
and
i
think
he
is
sitting
on
the
companion
steps
you
listen
and
if
he
tries
to
stop
me
i
call
you
the
stewardess
was
wide
awake
by
that
time
she
thought
perhaps
the
bell
instead
of
coming
from
turner
room
had
come
from
the
room
adjoining
turner
where
vail
slept
and
which
had
been
originally
designed
for
turner
she
suggested
turning
on
the
light
again
and
looking
at
the
bell
register
but
karen
objected
the
stewardess
sat
up
in
her
bed
which
was
the
one
under
the
small
window
opening
on
the
deck
aft
she
could
not
see
through
the
door
directly
but
a
faint
light
came
through
the
doorway
as
karen
opened
the
door
the
girl
stood
there
looking
out
then
suddenly
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
screamed
and
the
next
moment
there
was
a
blow
struck
she
staggered
back
a
step
or
two
and
fell
into
the
room
the
stewardess
saw
a
white
figure
in
the
doorway
as
the
girl
fell
almost
instantly
something
whizzed
by
her
striking
the
end
of
a
pillow
and
bruising
her
arm
she
must
have
fainted
when
she
recovered
faint
daylight
was
coming
into
the
room
and
the
body
of
the
danish
girl
was
lying
as
it
had
fallen
she
tried
to
get
up
and
fainted
again
that
was
her
story
and
it
did
not
tell
us
much
that
we
needed
to
know
she
showed
me
her
right
arm
which
was
badly
bruised
and
discolored
at
the
shoulder
what
do
you
mean
by
a
white
figure
it
looked
white
it
seemed
to
shine
when
i
went
to
call
you
sloane
the
door
to
your
room
was
closed
i
saw
it
closed
she
said
positively
i
had
forgotten
that
but
now
i
remember
the
axe
fell
beside
me
and
i
tried
to
scream
but
i
could
not
i
saw
the
door
closed
very
slowly
and
without
a
sound
then
i
fainted
the
thing
was
quite
possible
owing
to
the
small
size
of
the
cabin
and
to
the
fact
that
it
must
accommodate
two
bunks
the
door
opened
out
into
the
probably
the
woman
had
fainted
before
i
broke
the
lock
of
my
door
and
fell
into
the
main
cabin
but
a
white
figure
karen
exclaimed
miss
lee
said
slowly
that
some
one
was
sitting
on
the
companion
steps
yes
miss
and
she
thought
that
it
was
mr
turner
yes
the
stewardess
looked
quickly
at
turner
and
averted
her
eyes
it
may
have
been
all
talk
miss
about
his
about
his
bothering
her
she
was
a
great
one
to
fancy
that
men
were
following
her
about
miss
lee
got
up
and
came
to
the
door
where
i
was
standing
surely
we
need
not
be
prisoners
any
longer
she
said
in
an
undertone
it
is
daylight
if
i
stay
here
i
shall
go
crazy
the
murderer
is
still
on
the
ship
i
protested
and
just
now
the
deck
is
hardly
a
place
for
women
wait
until
this
afternoon
miss
lee
by
that
time
i
shall
have
arranged
for
a
guard
for
you
although
god
knows
with
every
man
under
suspicion
where
we
will
find
any
to
trust
you
will
arrange
a
guard
the
men
have
asked
me
to
take
charge
but
i
do
understand
the
first
mate
is
a
prisoner
of
the
crew
they
accuse
him
they
have
to
accuse
some
one
there
a
sort
of
hysteria
among
the
men
and
they
fixed
on
singleton
they
wo
hurt
him
i
see
to
that
and
it
makes
for
order
she
considered
for
a
moment
i
had
time
then
to
see
the
havoc
the
night
had
wrought
in
her
she
was
pale
with
deep
hollows
around
her
eyes
her
hands
shook
and
her
mouth
drooped
wearily
but
although
her
face
was
lined
with
grief
it
was
not
the
passionate
sorrow
of
a
loving
girl
she
had
not
loved
vail
i
said
to
myself
she
had
not
loved
vail
my
heart
beat
faster
will
you
allow
me
to
leave
this
room
for
five
minutes
if
i
may
go
with
you
and
if
you
will
come
back
without
protest
you
are
arbitrary
she
said
resentfully
i
only
wish
to
speak
to
mr
turner
then
if
i
may
wait
at
the
door
i
shall
not
go
under
those
conditions
miss
lee
i
said
desperately
surely
you
must
realize
the
state
of
affairs
we
must
trust
no
one
no
one
every
shadowy
corner
every
closed
door
may
hold
death
in
its
most
terrible
form
you
are
right
of
course
will
you
wait
outside
i
can
dress
and
be
ready
in
five
minutes
i
went
into
the
main
cabin
now
bright
with
the
morning
sun
which
streamed
down
the
forward
companionway
the
door
to
vail
room
across
was
open
and
williams
working
in
nervous
haste
was
putting
it
in
order
walking
up
and
down
his
shrewd
eyes
keenly
alert
charlie
jones
was
on
guard
revolver
in
hand
he
came
over
to
me
at
once
turner
is
moving
in
there
he
said
jerking
his
thumb
toward
the
forward
cabin
what
are
you
going
to
do
let
a
drunken
sot
like
that
give
us
orders
and
bang
us
with
a
belaying
pin
when
we
do
please
him
he
is
the
owner
but
one
thing
we
can
do
jones
we
can
keep
him
from
more
liquor
williams
he
came
out
more
dead
than
alive
williams
i
said
sternly
i
give
you
an
hour
to
get
rid
of
every
ounce
of
liquor
on
the
ella
remember
not
a
bottle
is
to
be
saved
but
mistah
turner
i
answer
to
turner
get
it
overboard
before
he
gets
around
and
williams
well
sullenly
i
going
around
after
you
and
if
i
find
so
much
as
a
pint
i
put
you
in
that
room
you
have
just
left
and
lock
you
in
he
turned
even
grayer
and
went
into
the
storeroom
a
day
later
and
the
crew
would
probably
have
resented
what
they
saw
that
morning
but
that
day
they
only
looked
up
apathetically
from
their
gruesome
work
of
sewing
into
bags
of
canvas
the
sheeted
bodies
on
the
deck
while
a
negro
in
a
white
coat
flung
over
the
rail
cases
of
fine
wines
baskets
and
boxes
full
of
bottles
dozen
after
dozen
of
brandies
and
liquors
all
sinking
beyond
salvage
in
the
blue
atlantic
chapter
ix
prisoners
my
first
thought
had
been
for
the
women
and
unluckily
to
save
them
a
shock
i
had
all
evidences
of
the
crime
cleared
away
as
quickly
as
possible
stains
that
might
have
been
of
invaluable
service
in
determining
the
murderer
were
washed
away
almost
before
they
were
dry
i
realized
this
now
too
late
but
the
axe
remained
and
i
felt
that
its
handle
probably
contained
a
record
for
more
skillful
eyes
than
mine
to
read
prints
that
under
the
microscope
would
reveal
the
identity
as
clearly
as
a
photograph
i
sent
for
burns
who
reported
that
he
had
locked
the
axe
in
the
captain
cabin
he
gave
me
the
key
which
i
fastened
to
a
string
and
hung
around
my
neck
under
my
shirt
he
also
reported
that
as
i
had
suggested
the
crew
had
gone
two
at
a
time
into
the
forecastle
and
had
brought
up
what
they
needed
to
stay
on
deck
the
forecastle
had
been
closed
and
locked
in
the
presence
of
the
crew
and
the
key
given
to
burns
who
fastened
it
to
his
the
two
hatchways
leading
to
the
hold
had
been
fastened
down
also
and
oleson
who
was
carpenter
had
nailed
them
fast
the
crew
had
been
instructed
to
stay
aft
of
the
wheel
except
when
on
watch
thus
the
helmsman
need
not
be
alone
as
i
have
said
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
companion
steps
near
the
wheel
was
closed
and
locked
and
entrance
to
the
after
house
was
to
be
gained
only
by
the
forward
companion
it
was
the
intention
of
burns
and
myself
to
keep
watch
here
amidships
burns
had
probably
suffered
more
than
any
of
us
whatever
his
relation
to
the
hansen
woman
had
been
he
had
been
with
her
only
three
hours
before
her
death
and
she
was
wearing
a
ring
of
his
a
silver
rope
tied
in
a
sailor
knot
when
she
died
and
burns
had
been
fond
of
captain
richardson
in
a
crew
where
respect
rather
than
affection
toward
the
chief
officer
was
the
rule
when
burns
gave
me
the
key
to
the
captain
room
charlie
jones
had
reached
the
other
end
of
the
long
cabin
and
was
staring
through
into
the
chartroom
it
was
a
time
to
trust
no
one
and
i
assured
myself
that
jones
was
not
looking
before
i
thrust
it
into
my
shirt
they
all
ready
leslie
burns
said
his
face
working
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
them
we
have
to
take
them
back
but
we
ca
do
that
it
a
two
weeks
matter
and
in
this
weather
we
will
take
them
back
burns
i
said
shortly
and
he
assented
mechanically
aye
aye
sir
just
how
it
was
to
be
done
was
a
difficult
thing
to
decide
miss
lee
had
not
appeared
yet
and
the
three
of
us
jones
burns
and
i
talked
it
over
jones
suggested
that
we
put
them
in
one
of
the
life
boats
and
nail
over
it
a
canvas
and
tarpaulin
cover
it
ai
my
own
idea
he
said
modestly
i
seen
it
done
once
on
the
argentina
it
worked
all
right
for
a
while
and
after
a
week
or
so
we
lowered
the
and
towed
it
astern
i
shuddered
but
the
idea
was
a
good
one
and
i
asked
burns
to
go
up
and
get
the
boat
ready
we
must
let
the
women
up
this
afternoon
i
said
and
if
it
is
possible
try
to
keep
them
from
learning
where
the
bodies
are
we
can
rope
off
a
part
of
the
deck
for
them
and
ask
them
not
to
leave
it
miss
lee
came
out
then
and
burns
went
on
deck
the
girl
was
looking
better
the
exertion
of
dressing
had
brought
back
her
color
and
her
lips
although
firmly
set
were
not
drawn
she
stood
just
outside
the
door
and
drew
a
deep
breath
you
must
not
keep
us
prisoners
any
longer
leslie
she
said
put
a
guard
over
us
if
you
must
but
let
us
up
in
the
air
this
afternoon
miss
lee
i
said
this
morning
you
are
better
below
she
understood
me
but
she
had
no
conception
of
the
brutality
of
the
crime
even
then
i
am
not
a
child
i
wish
to
see
them
i
shall
have
to
testify
you
will
not
see
them
miss
lee
she
stood
twisting
her
handkerchief
in
her
hands
she
saw
charlie
jones
pacing
the
length
of
the
cabin
revolver
in
hand
from
the
chartroom
came
the
sound
of
hammering
where
the
after
companion
door
already
locked
was
being
additionally
secured
with
strips
of
wood
nailed
across
i
understand
she
said
finally
will
you
take
me
to
karen
room
i
could
see
no
reason
for
objecting
but
so
thorough
was
the
panic
that
had
infected
us
all
that
i
would
not
allow
her
in
until
i
had
preceded
her
and
had
searched
in
the
clothes
closet
and
under
the
two
bunks
williams
had
not
reached
this
room
yet
and
there
was
a
pool
of
blood
on
the
floor
she
had
a
great
deal
of
courage
she
glanced
at
the
stain
and
looked
away
again
quickly
i
think
i
shall
not
come
in
will
you
look
at
the
bell
register
for
me
what
bell
is
registered
three
three
she
said
are
you
sure
i
looked
again
it
is
three
then
it
was
not
my
sister
bell
that
rang
it
was
mr
vail
it
must
be
a
mistake
perhaps
the
wires
turner
room
is
number
one
please
go
back
and
ask
her
to
ring
her
bell
while
i
see
how
it
registers
but
i
would
not
leave
her
there
alone
i
went
with
her
to
her
door
and
together
we
returned
to
the
maids
cabin
turner
had
rung
as
we
requested
and
her
bell
had
registered
one
he
rang
for
help
she
cried
and
broke
down
utterly
she
dropped
into
a
chair
in
the
and
cried
softly
helplessly
while
i
stood
by
unable
to
think
of
anything
to
do
or
say
i
think
now
that
it
was
the
best
thing
she
could
have
done
though
at
the
time
i
was
alarmed
i
ventured
finally
to
put
my
hand
on
her
shoulder
please
i
said
charlie
jones
came
to
the
door
of
the
chartroom
and
retreated
with
instinctive
good
taste
she
stopped
crying
after
a
time
and
i
knew
the
exact
instant
when
she
realized
my
touch
i
felt
her
stiffen
without
looking
up
she
drew
away
from
my
hand
and
i
stepped
back
hurt
and
angry
the
hurt
for
her
the
anger
that
i
could
not
remember
that
i
was
her
hired
servant
when
she
got
up
she
did
not
look
at
me
nor
i
at
her
at
least
not
consciously
but
when
in
those
days
was
i
not
looking
at
her
seeing
her
even
when
my
eyes
were
averted
feeling
her
presence
before
any
ordinary
sense
told
me
she
was
near
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
the
early
mornings
when
i
was
washing
down
the
deck
had
been
enough
to
set
my
blood
pounding
in
my
ears
the
last
thing
i
saw
at
night
when
i
took
myself
to
the
storeroom
to
sleep
was
her
door
across
the
main
cabin
and
in
the
morning
stumbling
out
with
my
pillow
and
blanket
i
gave
it
a
foolish
little
sign
of
greeting
what
she
would
not
see
the
men
had
seen
and
in
their
need
they
had
made
me
their
leader
to
her
i
was
leslie
the
common
sailor
i
registered
a
vow
that
morning
that
i
would
be
the
common
sailor
until
the
end
of
the
voyage
turner
is
awake
i
believe
i
said
stiffly
very
well
she
turned
back
into
the
main
cabin
but
she
paused
at
the
storeroom
door
it
is
curious
that
you
heard
nothing
she
said
slowly
you
slept
with
this
door
open
did
you
i
was
locked
in
she
stooped
quickly
and
looked
at
the
lock
you
broke
it
open
partly
at
the
last
i
heard
i
stopped
i
did
not
want
to
tell
her
what
i
had
heard
but
she
knew
you
heard
karen
when
she
screamed
yes
i
was
aroused
before
that
i
do
not
know
how
and
found
i
was
locked
in
i
thought
it
might
be
a
joke
forecastle
hands
are
fond
of
joking
and
they
resented
my
being
brought
here
to
sleep
i
took
out
some
of
the
screws
with
my
knife
and
then
i
broke
the
door
you
saw
no
one
it
was
dark
i
saw
and
heard
no
one
but
surely
the
man
at
the
wheel
hush
i
warned
her
he
is
there
he
heard
something
but
the
helmsman
can
not
leave
the
wheel
she
was
stooping
to
the
lock
again
you
are
sure
it
was
locked
the
bolt
is
still
shot
i
showed
her
then
where
is
the
key
the
key
certainly
find
the
key
and
you
will
find
the
man
who
locked
you
in
unless
i
reminded
her
it
flew
out
when
i
broke
the
lock
in
that
case
it
will
be
on
the
floor
but
an
exhaustive
search
of
the
cabin
floor
discovered
no
key
jones
seeing
us
searching
helped
his
revolver
in
one
hand
and
a
lighted
match
in
the
other
handling
both
with
an
abandon
of
ease
that
threatened
us
alternately
with
fire
and
a
bullet
but
there
was
no
key
it
stands
to
reason
miss
he
said
when
we
had
given
up
that
since
the
key
is
here
it
is
on
the
ship
that
there
key
is
a
sort
of
no
one
is
going
to
carry
a
thing
like
that
around
either
it
here
in
this
cabin
which
it
is
or
overboard
very
likely
jones
but
i
shall
ask
turner
to
search
the
men
she
went
toward
turner
door
and
jones
leaned
over
me
putting
a
hand
on
my
arm
she
right
boy
he
said
quickly
do
let
know
what
after
but
go
through
their
pockets
and
their
shoes
he
called
after
me
a
key
slips
into
a
shoe
mighty
easy
but
after
all
it
was
not
necessary
the
key
was
to
be
found
and
very
soon
chapter
x
that
mutiny
exactly
what
occurred
during
elsa
lee
visit
to
her
cabin
i
have
never
learned
he
was
sober
i
know
and
somewhat
dazed
with
no
recollection
whatever
of
the
previous
night
except
a
hazy
idea
that
he
had
quarreled
with
richardson
jones
and
i
waited
outside
he
suggested
that
we
have
prayers
over
the
bodies
when
we
placed
them
in
the
boat
and
i
agreed
to
read
the
burial
service
from
the
episcopal
prayer
book
the
voices
from
turner
cabin
came
steadily
miss
lee
low
tones
turner
heavy
bass
only
now
and
then
once
i
heard
her
give
a
startled
exclamation
and
both
jones
and
i
leaped
to
the
door
but
the
next
moment
she
was
talking
again
quietly
ten
minutes
fifteen
passed
i
grew
restless
and
took
to
wandering
about
the
cabin
johns
came
to
the
door
opposite
and
asked
to
have
tea
sent
down
to
the
stewardess
i
called
the
request
up
the
companionway
unwilling
to
leave
the
cabin
for
a
moment
when
i
came
back
jones
was
standing
at
the
door
of
vail
cabin
looking
in
his
face
was
pale
look
there
he
said
hoarsely
look
at
the
bell
he
must
have
tried
to
push
the
button
i
stared
in
williams
had
put
the
cabin
to
rights
as
nearly
as
he
could
the
soaked
mattress
was
gone
and
a
clean
linen
sheet
was
spread
over
the
bunk
poor
vail
clothing
as
he
had
taken
it
off
the
night
before
hung
on
a
mahogany
stand
beside
the
bed
and
above
almost
concealed
by
his
coat
was
the
bell
jones
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
darkish
smear
over
and
around
the
bell
on
the
white
paint
i
measured
the
height
of
the
bell
from
the
bed
it
was
well
above
and
to
one
side
a
smear
rather
than
a
print
too
indeterminate
to
be
of
any
value
sinister
cruel
he
did
do
that
charlie
i
said
he
could
have
got
up
to
it
after
that
is
the
murderer
mark
he
leaned
there
one
hand
against
the
wall
to
look
down
at
his
work
and
without
knowing
it
he
pressed
the
button
that
roused
the
two
women
he
had
not
heard
the
story
of
henrietta
sloane
and
as
we
waited
i
told
him
some
of
the
tension
was
relaxing
he
tried
in
his
argumentative
german
way
to
drag
me
into
a
discussion
as
to
the
foreordination
of
a
death
that
resulted
from
an
accidental
ringing
of
a
bell
but
my
ears
were
alert
for
the
voices
near
by
and
soon
miss
lee
opened
the
door
turner
was
sitting
on
his
bunk
he
had
made
an
attempt
to
shave
and
had
cut
his
chin
severely
he
was
in
a
and
was
holding
a
handkerchief
to
his
face
he
peered
at
me
over
it
with
eyes
this
this
is
horrible
leslie
he
said
i
can
hardly
believe
it
it
is
true
mr
turner
he
took
the
handkerchief
away
and
looked
to
see
if
the
bleeding
had
stopped
i
believe
he
intended
to
impress
us
both
with
his
coolness
but
it
was
an
unfortunate
attempt
his
lips
relieved
of
the
pressure
were
twitching
his
nerveless
fingers
could
hardly
refold
the
handkerchief
was
i
not
called
at
once
he
demanded
i
notified
you
you
were
you
must
have
gone
to
sleep
again
i
do
believe
you
called
me
you
lying
are
you
he
got
up
steadying
himself
by
the
wall
and
swaying
dizzily
to
the
motion
of
the
ship
you
shut
me
off
down
here
and
then
run
things
your
own
damned
way
he
turned
on
miss
lee
where
helen
in
her
room
marsh
she
has
one
of
her
headaches
please
disturb
her
where
williams
he
turned
to
me
i
can
get
him
for
you
tell
him
to
bring
me
a
highball
my
mouth
sticky
he
ran
his
tongue
over
his
dry
lips
and
take
a
message
from
me
to
richardson
he
stopped
startled
indeed
miss
lee
and
i
had
both
started
to
who
running
the
boat
anyhow
singleton
singleton
is
a
prisoner
in
the
forward
house
i
said
gravely
the
effect
of
this
was
astonishing
he
stared
at
us
both
and
finding
corroboration
in
miss
lee
face
his
own
took
on
an
instant
expression
of
relief
he
dropped
to
the
side
of
the
bed
and
his
color
came
slowly
back
he
even
smiled
a
crafty
grin
that
was
inexpressibly
horrible
singleton
he
said
why
do
they
how
do
they
know
it
was
he
he
had
quarreled
with
the
captain
last
night
and
he
was
on
duty
at
the
time
of
the
when
the
thing
happened
the
man
at
the
wheel
claims
to
have
seen
him
in
the
chartroom
just
before
and
there
was
other
evidence
i
believe
the
lookout
saw
him
forward
with
something
possibly
the
axe
not
decisive
of
course
but
enough
to
justify
putting
him
in
irons
somebody
did
it
and
the
murderer
is
on
board
mr
turner
his
grin
had
faded
but
the
crafty
look
in
his
eyes
remained
the
was
dark
how
could
the
steersman
he
checked
himself
abruptly
and
looked
at
us
both
quickly
where
are
they
he
asked
in
a
different
tone
on
deck
we
ca
keep
them
in
this
weather
we
must
i
said
we
will
have
to
get
to
the
nearest
port
as
quickly
as
we
can
and
surrender
ourselves
and
the
bodies
this
thing
will
have
to
be
sifted
to
the
bottom
turner
the
innocent
must
not
suffer
for
the
guilty
and
every
one
on
the
ship
is
under
suspicion
he
fell
into
a
passion
at
that
insisting
that
the
bodies
be
buried
at
once
asserting
his
ownership
of
the
vessel
as
his
authority
demanding
to
know
what
i
a
forecastle
hand
had
to
say
about
it
flinging
up
and
down
the
small
room
showering
me
with
invective
and
threats
and
shoving
miss
lee
aside
when
she
laid
a
calming
hand
on
his
arm
the
cut
on
his
chin
was
bleeding
again
adding
to
his
wild
and
sinister
expression
he
ended
by
demanding
williams
i
opened
the
door
and
called
to
charlie
jones
to
send
the
butler
and
stood
by
waiting
for
the
fresh
explosion
that
was
coming
williams
shakily
confessed
that
there
was
no
whiskey
on
board
where
is
it
turner
thundered
williams
looked
at
me
he
was
in
a
state
of
inarticulate
fright
i
ordered
it
overboard
i
said
turner
whirled
on
me
incredulity
and
rage
in
his
face
you
i
put
the
best
face
i
could
on
the
matter
and
eyed
him
steadily
there
has
been
too
much
drinking
on
this
ship
i
said
if
you
doubt
it
go
up
and
look
at
the
three
bodies
on
the
deck
what
have
you
to
do
about
it
his
eyes
were
narrowed
there
was
menace
in
every
line
of
his
face
with
schwartz
gone
captain
richardson
dead
and
singleton
in
irons
the
crew
had
no
officers
they
asked
me
to
take
charge
so
and
you
used
your
authority
to
meddle
with
what
does
not
concern
you
the
ship
has
an
officer
while
i
am
on
it
and
there
will
be
no
mutiny
he
flung
into
the
main
cabin
and
made
for
the
forward
companionway
i
stepped
back
to
allow
miss
lee
to
precede
me
she
was
standing
her
back
to
the
facing
the
door
she
looked
at
me
and
made
a
helpless
gesture
with
her
hands
as
if
the
situation
were
beyond
her
then
i
saw
her
look
down
she
took
a
quick
step
or
two
toward
the
door
and
stooping
picked
up
some
small
object
from
almost
under
my
foot
the
incident
would
have
passed
without
notice
had
she
not
in
attempting
to
wrap
it
in
her
handkerchief
dropped
it
i
saw
then
that
it
was
a
key
let
me
get
it
for
you
i
said
to
my
amazement
she
put
her
foot
over
it
please
see
what
turner
is
doing
she
said
it
is
the
key
to
my
will
you
let
me
see
it
no
it
is
not
the
key
to
a
it
does
not
concern
you
what
it
is
it
is
the
key
to
the
storeroom
door
you
are
stronger
than
i
am
you
look
the
brute
you
can
knock
me
away
and
get
it
i
knew
then
of
course
that
it
was
the
storeroom
key
but
i
could
not
take
it
by
force
and
so
defiantly
she
faced
me
so
valiant
was
every
line
of
her
slight
figure
that
i
was
ashamed
of
my
impulse
to
push
her
aside
and
take
it
i
loved
her
with
every
inch
of
my
overgrown
body
and
i
did
the
thing
she
knew
i
would
do
i
bowed
and
left
the
cabin
but
i
had
no
intention
of
losing
the
key
i
could
not
take
it
by
force
but
she
knew
as
well
as
i
did
what
finding
it
there
in
room
meant
turner
had
locked
me
in
but
i
must
be
able
to
prove
it
my
wits
against
hers
and
the
advantage
mine
i
had
the
women
under
guard
i
went
up
on
deck
a
curious
spectacle
revealed
itself
turner
purple
with
anger
was
haranguing
the
men
who
stood
amidships
huddled
together
but
grim
and
determined
withal
burns
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
was
standing
sullen
his
arms
folded
as
turner
ceased
he
took
a
step
forward
you
are
right
turner
he
said
it
your
ship
and
it
up
to
you
to
say
where
she
goes
and
how
she
goes
sir
but
some
one
will
hang
for
this
turner
some
one
that
on
this
deck
now
and
the
bodies
are
going
back
with
us
likewise
the
axe
there
ai
going
to
be
a
mistake
the
right
man
is
going
to
swing
that
mutiny
yes
sir
burns
acknowledged
his
face
paling
a
little
i
guess
you
could
call
it
that
turner
swung
on
his
heel
and
went
below
where
jones
relieved
of
guard
duty
by
burns
reported
him
locked
in
his
room
refusing
admission
to
his
wife
and
miss
lee
both
of
whom
had
knocked
on
the
door
the
trouble
with
turner
added
to
the
general
misery
of
the
situation
burns
got
our
position
at
noon
with
more
or
less
exactness
and
the
general
working
of
the
ella
went
on
well
enough
but
the
situation
was
indescribable
men
started
if
a
penknife
dropped
and
swore
if
a
sail
flapped
the
call
of
the
boatswain
pipe
rasped
their
ears
and
the
preparation
for
stowing
the
bodies
in
the
left
them
unnerved
and
sick
some
sort
of
a
meal
was
cooked
but
no
one
could
eat
williams
brought
up
untasted
the
luncheon
he
had
carried
down
to
the
after
house
at
two
all
hands
gathered
amidships
and
the
bodies
were
carried
forward
to
where
the
boat
lowered
in
its
davits
and
braced
lay
on
the
deck
it
had
been
lined
with
canvas
and
tarpaulin
and
a
cover
of
similar
material
lay
ready
to
be
nailed
in
place
all
the
men
were
bareheaded
many
were
in
tears
miss
lee
came
forward
with
us
and
it
was
from
her
that
i
too
moved
for

read
huskily
the
figures
at
my
feet
in
their
canvas
shrouds

gently
with
the
rocking
of
the
ship
the
sun
beat
down
on

chapter
xi
the
dead
line
johns
and
the
stewardess
came
up
late
in
the
afternoon
we
had
railed
off
a
part
of
the
deck
around
the
forward
companionway
for
them
and
none
of
the
crew
except
the
man
on
guard
was
allowed
inside
the
ropes
after
a
consultation
finding
the
ship
very
and
unwilling
with
the
night
coming
on
to
trust
any
of
the
men
burns
and
i
decided
to
take
over
this
duty
ourselves
and
by
stationing
ourselves
at
the
top
of
the
companionway
to
combine
the
duties
of
officer
on
watch
and
guard
of
the
after
house
to
make
the
women
doubly
secure
we
had
oleson
nail
all
the
windows
closed
although
they
were
merely
portholes
jones
was
no
longer
on
guard
below
and
i
had
exchanged
singleton
worthless
revolver
for
my
own
serviceable
one
johns
carefully
dressed
surveyed
the
deck
with
raised
eyebrows
for
us
she
asked
looking
at
me
the
men
were
gathered
about
the
wheel
aft
and
were
out
of
sloane
had
dropped
into
a
and
was
lying
back
with
closed
eyes
yes
mrs
johns
where
have
you
put
them
i
pointed
to
where
the
on
the
port
side
of
the
ship
swung
on
its
davits
and
the
mate
mr
singleton
he
is
in
the
forward
house
what
did
you
do
with
the
the
weapon
why
do
you
ask
that
morbid
curiosity
she
said
with
a
lightness
of
tone
that
rang
false
to
my
ears
and
then
naturally
i
should
like
to
be
sure
that
it
is
safely
overboard
so
it
will
not
be
she
shivered
used
again
it
is
not
overboard
johns
i
said
gravely
it
is
locked
in
a
safe
place
where
it
will
remain
until
the
police
come
to
take
it
you
are
rather
theatrical
are
you
she
scoffed
and
turned
away
but
a
second
later
she
came
back
to
me
and
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
tell
me
where
it
is
she
begged
you
are
making
a
mystery
of
it
and
i
detest
mysteries
i
saw
under
her
mask
of
lightness
then
she
wanted
desperately
to
know
where
the
axe
was
her
eyes
fell
under
my
gaze
i
am
sorry
there
is
no
mystery
it
is
simply
locked
away
for
she
bit
her
lip
do
you
know
what
i
think
she
said
slowly
i
think
you
have
hypnotized
the
crew
as
you
did
me
at
first
why
has
no
one
remembered
that
you
were
in
the
after
house
last
night
that
you
found
poor
wilmer
vail
that
you
raised
the
alarm
that
you
discovered
the
captain
and
karen
why
should
i
not
call
the
men
here
and
remind
them
of
all
that
i
do
not
believe
you
will
they
know
i
was
locked
in
the
storeroom
the
door
the
lock
you
could
have
locked
yourself
in
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
but
i
had
angered
her
and
she
went
on
cruelly
who
are
you
anyhow
you
are
not
a
sailor
you
came
here
and
were
taken
on
because
you
told
a
story
how
do
we
know
that
you
came
from
a
hospital
men
just
out
of
prison
look
as
you
did
do
you
know
what
we
called
you
the
first
two
days
out
we
called
you
and
now
because
you
have
dominated
the
crew
we
are
in
your
hands
do
turner
and
miss
lee
think
that
they
feel
as
i
do
this
is
a
picked
crew
men
the
turner
line
has
employed
for
years
you
are
very
brave
johns
i
said
if
i
were
what
you
think
i
am
i
would
be
a
dangerous
enemy
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
i
thought
fast
she
was
right
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
but
it
swept
over
me
overwhelmingly
you
are
leaving
me
only
one
thing
to
do
i
said
i
shall
surrender
myself
to
the
men
at
once
i
took
out
my
revolver
and
held
it
out
to
her
this
rope
is
a
the
crew
know
and
you
will
have
no
trouble
but
you
must
stand
guard
here
until
some
one
else
is
sent
she
took
the
revolver
without
a
word
and
somewhat
dazed
by
this
new
turn
of
events
i
went
aft
the
men
were
gathered
there
and
i
surrendered
myself
they
listened
in
silence
while
i
told
them
the
situation
burns
who
had
been
trying
to
sleep
sat
up
and
stared
at
me
incredulously
it
will
leave
you
pretty
boys
i
finished
but
better
fasten
me
up
somewhere
but
i
want
to
be
sure
of
one
thing
first
whatever
happens
keep
the
guard
for
the
women
we
like
to
talk
it
over
leslie
burns
said
after
a
word
with
the
others
i
went
forward
a
few
feet
taking
care
to
remain
where
they
could
see
me
and
very
soon
they
called
me
there
had
been
a
dispute
i
believe
adams
and
mcnamara
stood
off
from
the
others
their
faces
not
unfriendly
but
clearly
differing
from
the
decision
charlie
jones
who
by
reason
of
long
service
and
a
sort
of
pious
control
he
had
in
the
forecastle
was
generally
spokesman
for
the
crew
took
a
step
or
two
toward
me
we
not
do
it
boy
he
said
we
think
we
know
a
man
when
we
see
one
as
well
as
having
occasion
to
know
that
you
white
all
through
and
we
not
inclined
to
set
the
talk
of
women
against
what
we
think
best
to
do
so
you
stick
to
your
job
and
we
back
of
you
in
spite
of
myself
i
choked
up
i
tried
to
tell
them
what
their
loyalty
meant
to
me
but
i
could
only
hold
out
my
hand
and
one
by
one
they
came
up
and
shook
it
solemnly
we
think
mcnamara
said
when
last
of
all
he
and
adams
came
up
that
it
would
be
best
lad
if
we
put
down
in
the
all
that
has
happened
last
night
and
and
this
just
now
too
it
fresh
in
our
minds
now
and
it
will
be
something
to
go
by
so
burns
and
i
got
the
from
the
captain
cabin
the
axe
was
there
where
we
had
placed
it
earlier
in
the
day
lying
on
the
white
cover
of
the
bed
the
room
was
untouched
as
the
dead
man
had
left
it
a
collar
on
the
stand
brushes
put
down
hastily
a
cigar
which
had
burned
a
long
scar
on
the
wood
before
it
had
gone
out
we
went
out
silently
burns
carrying
the
book
i
locking
the
door
behind
us
johns
sitting
near
the
companionway
with
the
revolver
on
her
knee
looked
up
and
eyed
me
coolly
so
they
would
not
do
it
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
they
would
not
she
held
up
my
revolver
to
me
and
smiled
cynically
remember
she
said
i
only
said
you
were
a
possibility
thank
you
i
shall
remember
by
unanimous
consent
the
task
of
putting
down
what
had
happened
was
given
to
me
i
have
a
copy
of
the
before
me
now
the
one
that
was
used
at
the
trial
the
men
read
it
through
before
they
signed
it
august
thirteenth
this
morning
between
and
three
three
murders
were
committed
on
the
yacht
ella
at
the
request
of
johns
one
of
the
party
on
board
i
had
moved
to
the
after
house
to
sleep
putting
my
blanket
and
pillow
in
the
storeroom
and
sleeping
on
the
floor
there
johns
gave
as
her
reason
a
fear
of
something
going
wrong
as
there
was
trouble
between
turner
and
the
captain
i
slept
with
a
revolver
beside
me
and
with
the
door
of
the
storeroom
open
at
some
time
shortly
before
three
i
wakened
with
a
feeling
of
suffocation
and
found
that
the
door
was
closed
and
locked
on
the
outside
i
suspected
a
joke
among
the
crew
and
set
to
work
with
my
to
unscrew
the
lock
when
i
had
two
screws
out
a
woman
screamed
and
i
broke
down
the
door
as
the
main
cabin
was
dark
i
saw
no
one
and
could
not
tell
where
the
cry
came
from
i
ran
into
vail
cabin
next
the
storeroom
and
called
him
his
door
was
standing
open
i
heard
him
breathing
heavily
then
the
breathing
stopped
i
struck
a
match
and
found
him
dead
his
head
had
been
crushed
in
with
an
axe
the
left
hand
cut
off
and
there
were
gashes
on
the
right
shoulder
and
the
abdomen
i
knew
the
helmsman
would
be
at
the
wheel
and
ran
up
the
after
companionway
to
him
and
told
him
then
i
ran
forward
and
called
the
first
mate
singleton
who
was
on
duty
he
had
been
drinking
i
asked
him
to
call
the
captain
but
he
did
not
he
got
his
revolver
and
we
hurried
down
the
forward
companion
the
body
of
the
captain
was
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
his
head
on
the
lowest
stair
he
had
been
killed
like
vail
his
cap
had
been
placed
over
his
face
the
mate
collapsed
on
the
steps
i
found
the
light
switch
and
turned
it
on
there
was
no
one
in
the
cabin
or
in
the
i
ran
to
turner
room
going
through
vail
and
through
the
bathroom
turner
was
in
bed
fully
dressed
i
could
not
rouse
him
like
the
mate
he
had
been
drinking
the
mate
had
roused
the
crew
and
they
gathered
in
the
i
told
them
what
had
happened
and
that
the
murderer
must
be
among
us
i
suggested
that
they
stay
together
and
that
they
submit
to
being
searched
for
weapons
they
went
on
deck
in
a
body
and
i
roused
the
women
and
told
them
turner
asked
me
to
tell
the
two
maids
who
slept
in
a
cabin
off
the
chartroom
i
found
their
door
unlocked
and
receiving
no
answer
opened
it
karen
hansen
the
was
on
the
floor
dead
with
her
skull
crushed
in
the
stewardess
henrietta
sloane
was
fainting
in
her
bunk
an
axe
had
been
hurled
through
the
doorway
as
the
hansen
woman
fell
and
was
found
in
the
stewardess
bunk
dawn
coming
by
that
time
i
suggested
a
guard
at
the
two
companionways
and
this
was
done
the
men
were
searched
and
all
weapons
taken
from
them
singleton
was
under
suspicion
it
being
known
that
he
had
threatened
the
captain
life
and
oleson
a
lookout
claiming
to
have
seen
him
forward
where
the
axe
was
kept
the
crew
insisted
that
singleton
be
put
in
irons
he
made
no
objection
and
we
locked
him
in
his
own
room
in
the
forward
house
owing
to
the
loss
of
schwartz
the
second
mate
already
recorded
in
this
see
entry
for
august
ninth
the
death
of
the
captain
and
the
imprisonment
of
the
first
mate
the
ship
was
left
without
officers
until
turner
could
make
an
arrangement
the
crew
nominated
burns
one
of
themselves
as
mate
and
asked
me
to
assume
command
i
protested
that
i
knew
nothing
of
navigation
but
agreed
on
its
being
represented
that
as
i
was
not
one
of
them
there
could
be
ill
feeling
the
ship
was
searched
on
the
possibility
of
finding
a
stowaway
in
the
hold
but
nothing
was
found
i
divided
the
men
into
two
watches
burns
taking
one
and
i
the
other
we
nailed
up
the
after
companionway
and
forbade
any
member
of
the
crew
to
enter
the
after
house
the
forecastle
was
also
locked
the
men
bringing
their
belongings
on
deck
the
stewardess
recovered
and
told
her
story
which
in
her
own
writing
will
be
added
to
this
record
the
bodies
of
the
dead
were
brought
on
deck
and
sewed
into
canvas
and
later
with
appropriate
services
placed
in
the
it
being
the
intention
later
on
to
tow
the
boat
behind
us
turner
insisted
that
the
bodies
be
buried
at
sea
and
on
the
crew
opposing
this
retired
to
his
cabin
announcing
that
he
considered
the
position
of
the
men
a
mutiny
some
feeling
having
arisen
among
the
women
of
the
party
that
i
might
know
more
of
the
crimes
than
was
generally
supposed
having
been
in
the
after
house
at
the
time
they
were
committed
and
having
no
references
i
this
afternoon
voluntarily
surrendered
myself
to
burns
acting
first
mate
the
men
however
refused
to
accept
this
surrender
only
two
adams
and
mcnamara
favoring
it
i
expect
to
give
myself
up
to
the
police
at
the
nearest
port
until
the
matter
is
thoroughly
probed
the
axe
is
locked

chapter

the

mate
talks
williams
came
up
on
deck
late
that
afternoon
with
a
scared
face
and
announced
that
turner
had
locked
himself
in
his
cabin
and
was
raving
in
delirium
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
i
sent
burns
down
having
decided
in
view
of
johns
accusation
to
keep
away
from
the
living
quarters
of
the
family
burns
report
corroborated
what
williams
had
said
turner
was
in
the
grip
of
delirium
tremens
and
the
ella
was
without
owner
or
officers
turner
refused
to
open
either
door
for
us
as
well
as
we
could
make
out
he
was
moving
rapidly
but
almost
noiselessly
up
and
down
the
room
muttering
to
himself
now
and
then
throwing
himself
on
the
bed
only
to
get
up
at
once
he
rang
his
bell
a
dozen
times
and
summoned
williams
only
in
reply
to
the
butler
palpitating
knock
to
stand
beyond
the
door
and
refuse
to
open
it
or
to
voice
any
request
the
situation
became
so
urgent
that
finally
i
was
forced
to
go
down
with
no
better
success
turner
dragged
herself
across
on
the
state
of
affairs
being
reported
to
her
and
after
two
or
three
abortive
attempts
succeeded
in
getting
a
reply
from
him
marsh
she
called
i
want
to
talk
to
you
let
me
in
they
get
us
he
said
craftily
us
who
is
with
you
vail
he
replied
promptly
he
here
talking
he
wo
let
me
sleep
tell
him
to
give
you
the
key
and
you
will
keep
it
for
him
so
no
one
can
get
him
i
prompted
i
had
had
some
experience
with
such
cases
in
the
hospital
she
tried
it
without
any
particular
hope
but
it
succeeded
immediately
he
pushed
the
key
out
under
the
door
and
almost
at
once
we
heard
him
throw
himself
on
the
bed
as
if
satisfied
that
the
problem
of
his
security
was
solved
turner
held
the
key
out
to
me
but
i
would
not
take
it
give
it
to
williams
i
said
you
must
understand
turner
that
i
can
not
take
it
she
was
a
woman
of
few
words
and
after
a
glance
at
my
determined
face
she
turned
to
the
butler
you
will
have
to
look
after
turner
williams
see
that
he
is
comfortable
and
try
to
keep
him
in
bed
williams
put
out
a
trembling
hand
but
before
he
took
the
key
turner
voice
rose
petulantly
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
for
god
sake
wilmer
he
cried
plaintively
get
out
and
let
me
sleep
i
have
slept
for
a
month
williams
gave
a
whoop
of
fear
and
ran
out
of
the
cabin
crying
that
the
ship
was
haunted
and
that
vail
had
come
back
from
that
moment
i
believe
the
after
house
was
the
safest
spot
on
the
ship
to
my
knowledge
no
member
of
the
crew
so
much
as
passed
it
on
the
starboard
side
where
vail
and
turner
cabins
were
situated
it
was
the
one
good
turn
the
owner
of
the
ella
did
us
on
that
hideous
return
journey
for
during
most
of
the
sixteen
days
that
it
took
us
to
get
back
he
lay
in
his
cabin
alternating
the
wild
frenzy
of
delirium
tremens
with
quieter
moments
when
he
glared
at
us
with
crafty
murderous
eyes
and
picked
incessantly
at
the
bandages
that
tied
him
down
not
an
instant
did
he
sleep
that
we
could
discover
and
always
day
or
night
vail
was
with
him
and
they
were
quarreling
the
four
women
took
care
of
him
as
best
they
could
for
a
time
they
gave
him
the
bromides
i
prepared
taking
my
medical
knowledge
without
question
in
the
horror
of
the
situation
curiosity
had
no
place
and
class
distinctions
were
forgotten
that
great
leveler
a
common
trouble
put
henrietta
sloane
the
stewardess
and
the
women
of
the
party
at
the
same
table
in
the
after
house
where
none
ate
and
placed
the
responsibility
for
the
ship
although
i
was
nominally
in
command
on
the
shoulders
of
all
the
men
and
there
sprang
up
among
them
a
sort
of
esprit
de
corps
curious
under
the
circumstances
and
partly
explained
perhaps
by
the
belief
that
in
imprisoning
singleton
they
had
the
murderer
safely
in
hand
what
they
thought
of
turner
possible
connection
with
the
crime
i
do
not
know
personally
i
was
convinced
that
turner
was
guilty
perhaps
lulled
into
a
false
security
by
the
incarceration
of
the
two
men
we
unconsciously
relaxed
our
vigilance
but
by
the
first
night
the
crew
were
somewhat
calmer
here
and
there
a
pipe
was
lighted
and
a
plug
of
tobacco
went
the
rounds
the
forecastle
supper
served
on
deck
was
eaten
and
charlie
jones
securing
a
permission
that
i
thought
it
best
to
grant
went
forward
and
painted
a
large
black
cross
on
the
side
of
the
and
below
it
the
date
august
the
crew
watched
in
respectful
silence
the
weather
was
in
our
favor
the
wind
on
our
quarter
a
blue
sky
heaped
with
white
cloud
masses
with
the
sunset
fringed
with
the
deepest
rose
the
ella
made
no
great
way
but
sailed
easily
burns
and
i
alternated
at
the
forward
companionway
and
although
the
men
were
divided
into
watches
the
entire
crew
was
on
duty
virtually
all
the
time
i
find
on
consulting
the
book
in
which
i
recorded
beginning
with
that
day
the
incidents
of
the
return
voyage
that
two
things
happened
that
evening
one
was
my
interview
with
singleton
the
other
was
my
curious
and
depressing
clash
with
elsa
lee
on
the
deck
that
night
turner
being
quiet
and
burns
on
watch
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
dog
watch
six
i
went
forward
to
the
room
where
singleton
was
imprisoned
burns
gave
me
the
key
and
advised
me
to
take
a
weapon
i
did
not
however
nor
was
it
needed
the
first
mate
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
bunk
in
his
attitude
of
the
morning
his
head
in
his
hands
as
i
entered
he
looked
up
and
nodded
his
color
was
still
bad
he
looked
ill
and
nervous
as
might
have
been
expected
after
his
condition
the
night
before
for
god
sake
leslie
he
said
tell
them
to
open
the
window
choking
he
was
right
the
room
was
stifling
i
opened
the
door
behind
me
and
stood
in
the
doorway
against
a
rush
for
freedom
but
he
did
not
move
he
sank
back
into
his
dejected
attitude
will
you
eat
some
soup
if
i
send
it
he
shook
his
head
is
there
anything
you
care
for
better
let
me
starve
i
gone
anyhow
singleton
i
said
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
about
last
night
if
you
did
it
we
got
you
if
you
did
you
better
let
me
take
your
own
account
of
what
happened
while
it
fresh
in
your
mind
or
better
still
write
it
yourself
he
held
out
his
right
hand
i
saw
that
it
was
shaking
violently
could
hold
a
pen
he
said
tersely
would
be
believed
anyhow
the
air
being
somewhat
better
i
closed
and
locked
the
door
again
and
coming
in
took
out
my
notebook
and
pencil
he
watched
me
craftily
you
can
write
it
he
said
if
you
give
it
to
me
to
keep
i
not
going
to
put
the
rope
around
my
own
neck
if
it
all
right
my
lawyers
will
use
it
if
it
is
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
had
never
liked
the
man
and
his
tacit
acknowledgment
that
he
might
incriminate
himself
made
me
eye
him
with
shuddering
distaste
but
i
took
down
his
story
and
reproduce
it
here
minus
the
technicalities
and
profanity
with
which
it
was
interlarded
briefly
singleton
watch
began
at
midnight
the
captain
who
had
been
complaining
of
lumbago
had
had
the
cook
prepare
him
a
mustard
poultice
and
had
retired
early
burns
was
on
watch
from
eight
to
twelve
and
on
coming
into
the
forward
house
at
a
quarter
after
eleven
to
eat
his
night
lunch
reported
to
singleton
that
the
captain
was
in
bed
and
that
turner
had
been
asking
for
him
singleton
therefore
took
his
cap
and
went
on
deck
this
was
about
twenty
minutes
after
eleven
he
had
had
a
drink
or
two
earlier
in
the
evening
and
he
took
another
in
his
cabin
when
he
got
his
cap
he
found
turner
in
the
playing
solitaire
and
drinking
he
was
alone
and
he
asked
singleton
to
join
him
the
first
mate
looked
at
his
watch
and
accepted
the
invitation
but
decided
to
look
around
the
forward
house
to
be
sure
the
captain
was
asleep
he
went
on
deck
he
could
hear
burns
and
the
lookout
talking
the
forward
house
was
dark
he
listened
outside
the
captain
door
and
heard
him
breathing
heavily
as
if
asleep
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
some
one
was
watching
him
he
thought
of
schwartz
and
was
uncomfortable
he
did
not
feel
the
whiskey
at
all
he
struck
a
light
and
looked
around
there
was
no
one
in
sight
he
could
hear
charlie
jones
in
the
forecastle
drumming
on
his
banjo
and
burns
whistling
the
same
tune
as
he
went
aft
to
strike
the
bell
it
was
the
duty
of
the
officer
on
watch
to
strike
the
hour
it
was
then
half
after
eleven
as
he
passed
the
captain
door
again
his
foot
struck
something
and
it
fell
to
the
floor
he
was
afraid
the
captain
had
been
roused
and
stood
still
until
he
heard
him
breathing
regularly
again
then
he
stooped
down
his
foot
had
struck
an
axe
upright
against
the
captain
door
and
had
knocked
it
down
the
axe
belonged
on
the
outer
wall
of
the
forward
house
it
was
a
rule
that
it
must
not
be
removed
from
its
place
except
in
emergency
and
the
first
mate
carried
it
out
and
leaned
it
against
the
forward
port
corner
of
the
after
house
when
he
went
below
later
on
his
watch
he
carried
it
forward
and
put
it
where
it
belonged
he
found
turner
waiting
on
deck
and
together
they
descended
to
the
he
was
none
too
clear
as
to
what
followed
they
drank
together
vail
tried
to
get
turner
to
bed
and
failed
he
believed
that
burns
had
called
the
captain
the
captain
had
ordered
him
to
the
deck
and
there
had
been
a
furious
quarrel
he
felt
ill
by
that
time
and
when
he
went
on
watch
at
midnight
burns
was
uncertain
about
leaving
him
he
was
not
intoxicated
he
maintained
until
after
one
he
was
able
to
strike
the
bell
without
difficulty
and
spoke
each
time
he
went
aft
to
charlie
jones
who
was
at
the
wheel
after
that
however
he
suddenly
felt
strange
he
thought
he
had
been
doped
and
told
the
helmsman
so
he
asked
jones
to
strike
the
bell
for
him
and
going
up
on
the
forecastle
head
lay
down
on
the
boards
and
fell
asleep
he
did
not
waken
until
he
heard
six
bells
struck
three
and
before
he
had
fully
roused
i
had
called
him
then
i
said
when
the
lookout
saw
you
with
the
axe
you
were
replacing
it
yes
the
lookout
says
you
were
not
on
deck
between
two
and
three
how
does
he
know
i
was
asleep
you
had
threatened
to
get
the
captain
i
had
a
revolver
i
did
need
to
use
an
axe
much
as
i
disliked
the
man
i
was
inclined
to
believe
his
story
although
i
thought
he
was
keeping
something
back
i
leaned
forward
singleton
i
said
if
you
did
do
it
and
i
want
to
think
you
did
not
who
did
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
have
women
aboard
we
ought
to
know
what
precautions
to
take
i
was
the
only
man
on
deck
that
night
burns
was
about
and
he
had
a
quarrel
with
the
hansen
woman
jones
was
at
the
wheel
too
why
do
you
lock
up
jones
we
are
all
under
suspicion
i
admitted
but
you
had
threatened
the
captain
i
never
threatened
the
girl
or
mr
vail
i
had
no
answer
to
this
and
we
both
fell
silent
singleton
was
the
first
to
speak
how
are
you
going
to
get
back
the
men
can
sail
a
course
but
who
is
to
lay
it
out
turner
no
turner
ever
knew
anything
about
a
ship
but
what
it
made
for
him
turner
is
sick
look
here
singleton
you
want
to
get
back
as
much
as
we
do
or
more
would
you
be
willing
to
lay
a
course
if
you
were
taken
out
once
a
day
burns
is
doing
it
but
he
does
pretend
to
know
much
about
it
and
we
have
the
bodies
but
he
turned
ugly
again
and
refused
to
help
unless
he
was
given
his
freedom
and
that
i
knew
the
crew
would
not
agree
to
you
be
sick
enough
before
you
get
back
he
snarled
chapter
xiii
the
white
light
with
the
approach
of
night
our
vigilance
was
doubled
there
was
no
thought
of
sleep
among
the
crew
and
with
the
twilight
there
was
a
distinct
return
of
the
terror
of
the
morning
gathered
around
the
wheel
the
crew
listened
while
jones
read
evening
prayer
between
the
two
houses
where
the
deck
was
roped
off
miss
lee
was
alone
pacing
back
her
head
bent
her
arms
dropped
listlessly
the
wind
had
gone
and
the
sails
hung
loose
over
our
heads
i
stood
by
the
port
rail
although
my
back
was
toward
miss
lee
i
was
conscious
of
her
every
movement
and
so
i
knew
when
she
stooped
under
the
rope
and
moved
lightly
toward
the
starboard
rail
quick
as
she
was
i
was
quicker
there
was
still
light
enough
to
see
her
face
as
she
turned
when
i
called
to
her
miss
lee
you
must
not
leave
the
rope
must
not
i
am
sorry
to
seem
arbitrary
it
is
for
your
own
safety
i
was
crossing
the
deck
toward
her
as
i
spoke
i
knew
what
she
was
going
to
do
i
believe
when
she
saw
my
face
that
she
read
my
knowledge
in
it
she
turned
back
from
the
rail
and
faced
me
surely
i
may
go
to
the
rail
it
would
be
unwise
if
for
no
other
reason
than
discipline
discipline
are
you
trying
to
discipline
me
miss
lee
you
do
not
seem
to
understand
i
said
as
patiently
as
i
could
just
now
i
am
in
charge
of
the
ella
it
does
not
matter
how
unfit
i
am
the
fact
remains
nor
does
it
concern
me
that
your
owns
the
ship
i
am
in
charge
of
it
and
god
willing
there
will
be
no
more
crimes
on
it
you
will
go
back
to
the
part
of
the
deck
that
is
reserved
for
you
or
you
will
go
below
and
stay
there
she
flushed
with
anger
and
stood
there
with
her
head
thrown
back
eyeing
me
with
a
contempt
that
cut
me
to
the
quick
the
next
moment
she
wheeled
and
raising
her
hand
flung
toward
the
rail
the
key
to
the
storeroom
door
i
caught
her
hand
too
late
but
fate
was
on
my
side
after
all
as
i
stood
still
gripping
her
wrist
the
key
fell
ringing
almost
at
my
feet
it
had
struck
one
of
the
lower
yard
braces
i
stooped
and
picking
it
up
pocketed
it
she
was
dazed
i
think
she
made
no
effort
to
free
her
arm
but
she
put
her
other
hand
to
her
heart
unexpectedly
and
i
saw
that
she
was
profoundly
shocked
i
led
her
unprotesting
to
a
and
put
her
down
in
it
and
still
she
had
not
spoken
she
lay
back
and
closed
her
eyes
she
was
too
strong
to
faint
she
was
superbly
healthy
but
she
knew
as
well
as
i
did
what
that
key
meant
and
she
had
delivered
it
into
my
hands
as
for
me
i
was
driven
hard
that
night
for
as
i
stood
there
looking
down
at
her
she
held
out
her
hand
to
me
palm
up
please
she
said
pleadingly
what
does
it
mean
to
you
leslie
we
were
kind
to
you
were
we
when
you
were
ill
we
took
you
on
my
sister
and
i
and
now
you
hate
us
hate
you
he
did
know
what
he
was
doing
he
was
sane
no
sane
man
kills
that
way
he
had
a
revolver
if
he
had
wanted
please
give
me
that
key
some
one
will
suffer
would
you
have
the
innocent
suffer
with
the
guilty
if
they
can
not
prove
it
against
any
one
they
may
prove
it
against
me
you
i
was
in
the
after
house
i
said
doggedly
i
was
the
one
to
raise
an
alarm
and
to
find
the
bodies
you
do
not
know
anything
about
me
i
am
who
told
you
that
it
does
not
matter
i
know
it
i
told
you
the
truth
miss
elsa
i
came
here
from
the
hospital
but
i
may
have
to
fight
for
my
life
against
the
turner
money
and
influence
i
have
only
this
key
shall
i
give
it
to
you
i
held
it
out
to
her
on
the
palm
of
my
hand
it
was
melodramatic
probably
but
i
was
very
young
and
by
that
time
wildly
in
love
with
her
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
she
would
take
it
but
she
only
drew
a
deep
breath
and
pushed
my
hand
away
keep
it
she
said
i
am
ashamed
we
were
silent
after
that
she
staring
out
over
the
rail
at
the
deepening
sky
and
looking
at
her
as
one
looks
at
a
star
i
thought
she
had
forgotten
my
presence
so
long
she
sat
silent
the
voices
of
the
men
aft
died
away
gradually
as
one
by
one
they
rolled
themselves
in
blankets
on
the
deck
not
to
sleep
but
to
rest
and
watch
the
lookout
in
his
lonely
perch
high
above
the
deck
called
down
guardedly
to
ask
for
company
and
one
of
the
crew
went
up
when
she
turned
to
me
again
it
was
to
find
my
eyes
fixed
on
her
you
say
you
have
neither
money
nor
influence
and
yet
you
are
a
gentleman
i
hope
so
you
know
what
i
mean
impatiently
you
are
not
a
common
sailor
i
did
not
claim
to
be
one
you
are
quite
determined
we
shall
not
know
anything
about
you
there
is
nothing
to
know
i
have
given
you
my
name
which
is
practically
all
i
own
in
the
world
i
needed
a
chance
to
recover
from
an
illness
and
i
was
obliged
to
work
this
offered
the
best
opportunity
to
combine
both
you
are
not
getting
much
chance
to
rest
she
said
with
a
sigh
and
got
up
i
went
with
her
to
the
companionway
and
opened
the
door
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
miss
lee
i
i
feel
very
safe
with
you
on
guard
she
said
and
held
out
her
hand
i
took
it
in
mine
with
my
heart
leaping
it
was
as
cold
as
ice
that
night
at
four
bells
i
mustered
the
crew
as
silently
as
possible
around
the
jollyboat
and
we
lowered
it
into
the
water
the
possibility
of
a
dead
calm
had
convinced
me
that
the
sooner
it
was
done
the
better
we
arranged
to
tow
the
boat
astern
and
charlie
jones
suggested
a
white
light
in
its
bow
so
we
could
be
sure
at
night
that
it
had
not
broken
loose
accordingly
we
attached
to
the
bow
of
the
a
tailed
block
with
an
endless
fall
riven
through
it
so
as
to
be
able
to
haul
in
and
refill
the
lantern
five
bells
struck
by
the
time
we
had
arranged
the
we
dropped
the
astern
and
made
fast
the
rope
it
gave
me
a
curious
feeling
that
small
boat
rising
and
falling
behind
us
with
its
dead
crew
and
its
rocking
light
and
on
its
side
above
the
the
black
cross
a
curious
feeling
of
pursuit
as
if
across
the
water
they
in
the
boat
were
following
us
and
perhaps
because
the
light
varied
sometimes
it
seemed
to
drop
behind
as
if
wearying
of
the
chase
and
again
in
great
leaps
to
be
overtaking
us
to
be
almost
upon
us
an
open
boat
with
a
small
white
light
and
a
black
cross
on
the
side
chapter
xiv
from
the
crow
nest
the
night
passed
without
incident
except
for
one
thing
that
we
were
unable
to
verify
at
six
bells
during
the
darkest
hour
of
the
night
that
precedes
the
early
dawn
of
summer
adams
from
the
called
down
in
a
panic
that
there
was
something
crawling
on
all
fours
on
the
deck
below
him
burns
on
watch
at
the
companionway
ran
forward
with
his
revolver
and
narrowly
escaped
being
brained
adams
at
that
moment
flinging
down
a
marlinespike
that
he
had
carried
aloft
with
him
i
heard
the
crash
and
joined
burns
and
together
we
went
over
the
deck
and
both
houses
everything
was
quiet
the
crew
in
various
attitudes
of
exhausted
sleep
their
chests
and
dittybags
around
them
oleson
at
the
wheel
and
singleton
in
his
breathing
heavily
adams
nerve
was
completely
gone
and
being
now
thoroughly
awake
i
joined
him
in
the
nothing
could
convince
him
that
he
had
been
the
victim
of
a
nervous
hallucination
he
stuck
to
his
story
firmly
it
was
on
the
first
he
maintained
i
saw
it
gleaming
gleaming
sort
of
shining
he
explained
it
came
up
over
the
rail
and
at
first
it
stood
up
tall
like
a
white
post
you
did
say
before
that
it
was
white
it
was
shining
he
said
slowly
trying
to
put
his
idea
into
words
maybe
not
exactly
white
but
it
stood
still
for
so
long
i
thought
i
must
be
mistaken
that
it
was
a
light
on
the
rigging
then
i
got
to
thinking
that
there
was
no
place
for
a
light
to
come
from
just
there
that
was
true
enough
first
it
was
as
tall
as
a
man
or
taller
maybe
he
went
on
then
it
seemed
about
half
that
high
and
still
in
the
same
place
then
it
got
lower
still
and
it
took
to
crawling
along
on
its
belly
it
was
then
i
yelled
i
looked
down
the
green
starboard
light
threw
a
light
over
only
a
small
part
of
the
deck
the
red
light
did
no
better
the
masthead
was
possibly
thirty
feet
above
the
hull
and
served
no
illuminating
purpose
whatever
from
the
bridge
forward
the
deck
was
practically
dark
you
yelled
and
then
what
happened
his
reply
was
vague
troubled
i
not
sure
he
said
slowly
it
seemed
to
fade
away
the
white
got
smaller
went
to
nothing
like
a
cloud
blown
away
in
a
gale
i
flung
the
spike
i
accepted
the
story
with
outward
belief
and
a
mental
reservation
but
i
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
the
spike
adams
had
thrown
lying
below
on
deck
no
more
formidable
weapon
short
of
an
axe
could
be
devised
i
said
as
much
i
going
down
for
it
i
said
if
you
nervous
you
better
keep
it
by
you
but
do
drop
it
on
everything
that
moves
below
you
almost
got
burns
i
went
down
cautiously
and
struck
a
match
where
adams
had
indicated
the
spike
it
was
not
there
nor
had
burns
picked
it
up
a
splintered
board
showed
where
it
had
struck
and
a
smaller
indentation
where
it
had
rebounded
but
the
marlinespike
was
gone
and
burns
had
not
seen
it
we
got
a
lantern
and
searched
systematically
without
result
burns
turned
to
me
a
face
ghastly
in
the
oil
light
somebody
has
it
he
said
and
there
will
be
more
murder
oh
my
god
leslie
when
you
went
back
after
the
alarm
did
you
count
the
men
no
oleson
said
no
one
had
come
forward
they
could
not
have
passed
without
his
seeing
them
he
has
the
binnacle
lantern
and
two
other
lights
and
no
one
came
from
the
after
house
no
one
eight
bells
rang
out
sharply
the
watch
changed
i
took
the
revolver
and
burns
position
at
the
companionway
while
burns
went
aft
he
lined
up
the
men
by
the
binnacle
light
and
went
over
them
carefully
the
marlinespike
was
not
found
but
he
took
from
the
cook
a
long
and
brought
both
negro
and
knife
forward
to
me
the
man
was
almost
collapsing
with
terror
he
maintained
that
he
had
taken
the
knife
for
and
we
let
him
go
with
a
warning
dawn
brought
me
an
hour
sleep
the
first
since
my
awakening
in
the
storeroom
when
i
roused
jones
at
the
wheel
had
thrown
an
extra
blanket
over
me
for
the
morning
was
cool
and
a
fine
rain
was
falling
the
men
were
scattered
around
in
attitudes
of
dejection
one
or
two
of
them
leaning
over
the
rail
watching
the
riding
easily
behind
us
jones
heard
me
moving
and
turned
your
friend
below
must
be
pretty
bad
sir
he
said
your
has
been
asking
for
you
i
would
let
them
wake
you
my
what
he
waxed
apologetic
at
once
that
just
my
foolishness
leslie
he
said
no
disrespect
to
the
lady
i
sure
if
it
ai
so
it
ai
and
no
harm
done
if
it
is
so
why
you
need
be
ashamed
boy
way
of
a
man
with
a
maid
says
the
book
you
should
have
called
me
jones
i
said
sharply
and
no
nonsense
of
that
sort
with
the
men
he
looked
hurt
but
made
no
reply
beyond
touching
his
cap
and
while
i
am
mentioning
that
i
may
speak
of
the
changed
attitude
of
the
men
toward
me
from
the
time
they
put
me
in
charge
whether
the
deference
was
to
the
office
rather
than
the
man
or
whether
in
placing
me
in
authority
they
had
merely
expressed
a
general
feeling
that
i
was
with
them
rather
than
of
them
i
do
not
know
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
former
the
result
in
any
case
was
the
same
they
deferred
to
me
whenever
possible
brought
large
and
small
issues
alike
to
me
served
me
my
food
alone
against
my
protestations
and
while
navigating
the
ship
on
their
own
responsibility
took
care
to
come
to
me
for
authority
for
everything
before
i
went
below
that
morning
i
suggested
that
some
of
the
spare
canvas
be
used
to
erect
a
shelter
on
the
after
deck
and
this
was
done
the
rain
by
that
time
was
driving
steadily
a
summer
rain
without
wind
the
men
seemed
glad
to
have
occupation
and
from
that
time
on
the
tent
which
they
erected
over
the
hatchway
aft
of
the
wheel
was
their
living
and
eating
quarters
it
added
something
to
their
comfort
i
was
not
so
certain
that
it
added
to
their
security
turner
was
violent
that
day
i
found
all
four
women
awake
and
dressed
and
turner
whose
hour
it
was
on
duty
in
a
chair
outside
the
door
the
stewardess
her
arm
in
a
sling
was
making
tea
over
a
and
elsa
was
helping
her
johns
was
stretched
on
a
divan
and
on
the
table
lay
a
small
revolver
clearly
elsa
had
told
the
incident
of
the
key
i
felt
at
once
the
atmosphere
of
antagonism
johns
watched
me
coolly
from
under
lowered
eyelids
the
stewardess
openly
scowled
and
turner
rose
hastily
and
glanced
at
johns
as
if
in
doubt
elsa
had
her
back
to
me
and
was
busy
with
the
cups
i
afraid
you
had
a
bad
night
i
said
a
very
bad
night
turner
replied
stiffly
delirium
very
marked
he
has
talked
of
a
white
figure
we
can
not
quite
make
it
out
it
seems
to
be
wilmer
mr
vail
she
had
not
opened
the
door
but
stood
nervously
twisting
her
fingers
before
it
the
bromides
had
no
effect
she
glanced
helplessly
at
the
others
none
she
said
after
a
moment
elsa
lee
wheeled
suddenly
and
glanced
scornfully
at
her
sister
why
do
you
tell
him
she
demanded
why
do
you
say
you
give
the
bromides
why
not
johns
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
looked
at
me
why
should
we
she
asked
how
do
we
know
what
you
are
giving
him
you
are
not
friendly
to
him
or
to
us
we
know
what
you
are
trying
to
do
you
are
trying
to
save
yourself
at
any
cost
you
put
a
guard
at
the
companionway
you
rail
off
the
deck
for
our
safety
you
drop
the
storeroom
key
in
turner
cabin
where
elsa
will
find
it
and
will
be
obliged
to
acknowledge
she
found
it
and
then
take
it
from
her
by
force
so
you
can
show
it
later
on
and
save
yourself
elsa
turned
on
her
quickly
i
told
you
how
he
got
it
adele
i
tried
to
throw
it
oh
if
you
intend
to
protect
him
i
am
rather
bewildered
i
said
slowly
but
under
the
circumstances
i
suppose
you
do
not
wish
me
to
look
after
mr
turner
we
think
not
from
turner
how
will
you
manage
alone
johns
got
up
and
lounged
to
the
table
she
wore
a
long
satin
negligee
of
some
sort
draped
with
lace
it
lay
around
her
on
the
floor
in
gleaming
lines
of
soft
beauty
her
reddish
hair
was
low
on
her
neck
and
she
held
a
cigarette
negligently
in
her
teeth
all
the
women
smoked
johns
incessantly
she
laid
one
hand
lightly
on
the
revolver
and
flicked
the
ash
from
her
cigarette
with
the
other
we
have
decided
she
said
insolently
that
if
the
crew
may
establish
a
so
may
we
our
is
the
foot
of
the
companionway
one
of
us
will
be
on
watch
always
i
am
an
excellent
shot
i
do
not
doubt
it
i
faced
her
i
am
afraid
you
will
suffer
for
air
otherwise
the
arrangement
is
good
you
relieve
me
of
part
of
the
responsibility
for
your
safety
tom
will
bring
your
food
to
the
steps
and
leave
it
there
thank
you
with
good
luck
two
weeks
will
see
us
in
port
and
then
in
port
you
are
taking
us
back
why
not
she
picked
up
the
revolver
and
examined
it
absently
then
she
glanced
at
me
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
how
can
we
know
perhaps
this
is
a
mutiny
and
you
are
on
your
way
to
some
god
forsaken
island
the
usual
thing
among
pirates
is
it
i
have
no
answer
to
that
johns
i
said
quietly
and
turned
to
where
elsa
sat
i
shall
not
come
back
unless
you
send
for
me
i
said
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
my
one
object
in
life
from
now
on
is
to
get
you
back
safely
to
land
that
your
safety
comes
first
and
that
the
vigilance
on
deck
in
your
interest
will
not
be
relaxed
fine
words
the
stewardess
muttered
the
low
mumbling
from
turner
room
had
persisted
steadily
now
it
rose
again
in
the
sharp
frenzy
that
had
characterized
it
through
the
long
night
do
look
at
me
like
that
man
he
cried
and
then
he
lost
a
hand
a
hand
turner
went
quickly
into
the
cabin
and
the
sounds
ceased
i
looked
at
elsa
but
she
avoided
my
eyes
i
turned
heavily
and
went
up
the
companionway
chapter
xv
a
knocking
in
the
hold
it
rained
heavily
all
that
day
late
in
the
afternoon
we
got
some
wind
and
all
hands
turned
out
to
trim
sail
action
was
a
relief
and
the
weather
suited
our
disheartened
state
better
than
had
the
pitiless
august
sun
the
glaring
white
of
deck
and
canvas
and
the
heat
the
heavy
drops
splashed
and
broke
on
top
of
the
and
as
the
wind
came
up
it
rode
behind
us
like
a
live
thing
our
distress
signal
hung
sodden
too
wet
to
give
more
than
a
dejected
response
to
the
wind
that
tugged
at
it
late
in
the
afternoon
we
sighted
a
large
steamer
and
when
as
darkness
came
on
she
showed
no
indication
of
changing
her
course
burns
and
i
sent
up
a
rocket
and
blew
the
fog
horn
steadily
she
altered
her
course
then
and
came
towards
us
and
we
ran
up
our
code
flags
for
immediate
assistance
but
she
veered
off
shortly
after
and
went
on
her
way
we
made
no
further
effort
to
attract
her
attention
burns
thought
her
a
passenger
steamer
for
the
bermudas
and
as
her
way
was
not
ours
she
could
not
have
been
of
much
assistance
one
or
two
of
the
men
were
already
showing
signs
of
strain
oleson
the
swede
developed
a
chill
followed
by
fever
and
a
mild
delirium
and
adams
complained
of
sore
throat
and
nausea
oleson
illness
was
genuine
enough
adams
i
suspected
of
malingering
he
had
told
the
men
he
would
not
go
up
to
the
again
without
a
revolver
and
this
i
would
not
permit
our
original
crew
had
numbered
nine
with
the
cook
and
williams
eleven
but
the
two
negroes
were
not
seamen
and
were
frightened
into
a
state
bordering
on
collapse
of
the
men
actually
useful
there
were
left
only
five
clarke
mcnamara
charlie
jones
burns
and
myself
and
i
was
a
negligible
quantity
as
regarded
the
working
of
the
ship
with
burns
and
myself
on
guard
duty
the
burden
fell
on
clarke
mcnamara
and
jones
a
suggestion
of
mine
that
we
release
singleton
was
instantly
vetoed
by
the
men
it
was
arranged
finally
that
clarke
and
mcnamara
take
alternate
watches
at
the
wheel
and
jones
be
given
the
lookout
for
the
night
to
be
relieved
by
either
burns
or
myself
i
watched
the
weather
anxiously
we
were
too
to
manage
any
sort
of
a
gale
and
yet
the
urgency
of
our
return
made
it
unwise
to
shorten
canvas
too
much
it
was
as
well
perhaps
that
i
had
so
much
to
distract
my
mind
from
the
situation
in
the
after
house
the
second
of
the
series
of
curious
incidents
that
complicated
our
return
voyage
occurred
that
night
i
was
on
watch
from
eight
bells
midnight
until
four
in
the
morning
jones
was
in
the
mcnamara
at
the
wheel
i
was
at
the
starboard
forward
corner
of
the
after
house
looking
over
the
rail
i
thought
that
i
had
seen
the
lights
of
a
steamer
the
rain
had
ceased
but
the
night
was
still
very
dark
i
heard
a
sort
of
rapping
from
the
forward
house
and
took
a
step
toward
it
listening
jones
heard
it
too
and
called
down
to
me
nervously
to
see
what
was
wrong
i
called
up
to
him
cautiously
to
come
down
and
take
my
place
while
i
investigated
i
thought
it
was
singleton
when
jones
had
taken
up
his
position
at
the
companionway
i
went
forward
the
knocking
continued
and
i
traced
it
to
singleton
cabin
his
window
was
open
being
too
small
for
danger
but
barred
across
with
strips
of
wood
outside
like
those
in
the
after
house
but
he
was
at
the
door
hammering
frantically
i
called
to
him
through
the
open
window
but
the
only
answer
was
renewed
and
louder
pounding
i
ran
around
to
his
door
and
felt
for
the
key
which
i
carried
what
is
the
matter
i
called
who
is
it
leslie
for
god
sake
open
the
door
i
unlocked
it
and
threw
it
open
he
retreated
before
me
with
his
hands
out
and
huddled
against
the
wall
beside
the
window
i
struck
a
match
his
face
was
drawn
and
distorted
and
he
held
his
arm
up
as
if
to
ward
off
a
blow
i
lighted
the
lamp
for
there
were
no
electric
lights
in
the
forward
house
and
stared
at
him
amazed
satisfied
that
i
was
really
leslie
he
had
stooped
and
was
fumbling
under
the
window
when
he
straightened
he
held
something
out
to
me
in
the
palm
of
his
shaking
hand
i
saw
with
surprise
that
it
was
a
well
i
demanded
it
was
on
the
ledge
he
said
hoarsely
i
put
it
there
myself
all
the
time
i
was
pounding
i
kept
saying
that
if
it
was
still
there
it
was
not
true
i
just
fancied
it
if
the
pouch
was
on
the
floor
know
know
what
it
was
there
he
said
looking
over
his
shoulder
it
been
there
three
times
looking
in
all
in
white
and
grinning
at
me
a
man
it
it
has
got
any
face
how
could
it
grin
at
you
if
it
has
any
face
i
demanded
impatiently
pull
yourself
together
and
tell
me
what
you
saw
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
tell
a
connected
story
and
when
he
did
i
was
inclined
to
suspect
that
he
had
heard
us
talking
the
night
before
had
heard
adams
description
of
the
intruder
on
the
and
that
what
with
drink
and
terror
he
had
fancied
the
rest
and
yet
i
was
not
so
sure
i
was
asleep
the
first
time
he
said
i
do
know
how
long
ago
it
was
i
woke
up
cold
with
the
feeling
that
something
was
looking
at
me
i
raised
up
in
bed
and
there
was
a
thing
at
the
window
it
was
looking
in
what
sort
of
a
thing
what
i
told
you
white
a
white
head
it
was
a
head
for
god
sake
leslie
i
ca
tell
you
any
more
than
that
i
saw
it
that
enough
i
saw
it
three
times
it
is
enough
for
me
i
said
doggedly
it
had
any
head
or
face
but
it
looked
in
it
dark
out
there
how
could
you
see
for
reply
he
leaned
over
and
turning
down
the
lamp
blew
it
out
we
sat
in
the
smoking
darkness
and
slowly
out
of
the
thick
night
the
window
outlined
itself
i
could
see
it
distinctly
but
how
white
and
faceless
had
it
stared
in
at
the
window
or
reached
through
the
bars
as
singleton
declared
it
had
done
and
waved
a
fingerless
hand
at
us
he
was
in
a
state
of
mental
and
physical
collapse
and
begged
so
pitifully
not
to
be
left
that
at
last
i
told
him
i
would
take
him
with
me
on
his
promise
to
remain
in
a
chair
until
dawn
and
to
go
back
without
demur
he
sat
near
me
amidships
huddled
down
among
the
cushions
of
one
of
the
wicker
chairs
not
sleeping
but
staring
straight
out
motionless
with
the
first
light
of
dawn
burns
relieved
me
and
i
went
forward
with
singleton
he
dropped
into
his
bunk
and
was
asleep
almost
immediately
then
inch
by
inch
i
went
over
the
deck
for
footprints
for
any
clue
to
what
under
happier
circumstances
i
should
have
considered
a
ghastly
hoax
but
the
deck
was
slippery
and
sodden
the
rail
dripping
and
between
the
davits
where
the
had
swung
was
stretched
a
line
with
a
shirt
of
burns
hung
on
it
absurdly
enough
to
dry
poor
burns
promoted
to
the
dignity
of
first
mate
and
trying
to
dress
the
part
oleson
and
adams
made
no
attempt
to
work
that
day
indeed
oleson
was
not
able
as
i
had
promised
the
breakfast
for
the
after
house
was
placed
on
the
companion
steps
by
tom
the
cook
whence
it
was
removed
by
sloane
i
saw
nothing
of
either
elsa
lee
or
johns
burns
was
inclined
to
resent
the
deadline
the
women
had
drawn
below
and
suggested
that
since
they
were
so
anxious
to
take
care
of
themselves
we
give
up
guarding
the
after
house
and
let
them
do
it
we
were
enough
he
urged
and
if
they
were
going
to
take
that
attitude
let
them
manage
i
did
not
argue
but
my
eyes
traveled
over
the
rail
to
where
the
rose
to
meet
the
fresh
sea
of
the
morning
and
he
colored
after
that
he
made
no
comment
singleton
awakened
before
noon
and
ate
his
first
meal
since
the
murders
he
looked
better
and
we
had
a
long
talk
i
outside
the
window
and
he
within
he
held
to
his
story
of
the
night
before
but
was
still
vague
as
to
just
how
the
thing
looked
of
what
it
was
he
seemed
to
have
no
doubt
it
was
the
specter
of
either
the
captain
or
vail
he
excluded
the
woman
because
she
was
shorter
as
i
stood
outside
he
measured
on
me
the
approximate
height
of
the
apparition
somewhere
about
five
feet
eight
he
could
see
shirt
he
admitted
but
the
thing
had
been
close
to
the
window
i
found
myself
convinced
against
my
will
and
that
afternoon
alone
i
made
a
second
and
more
thorough
examination
of
the
forecastle
and
the
hold
in
the
former
i
found
nothing
having
been
closed
for
over
hours
it
was
stifling
and
full
of
odors
the
crew
abandoning
it
in
haste
had
left
it
in
disorder
i
made
a
systematic
search
beginning
forward
and
working
back
i
prodded
in
and
under
bunks
and
moved
the
clothing
that
hung
on
every
hook
and
swung
to
the
undoing
of
my
nerves
with
every
swell
much
curious
salvage
i
found
under
mattresses
and
beneath
bunks
a
rosary
and
a
dozen
filthy
pictures
under
the
same
pillow
more
than
one
bottle
of
whiskey
and
even
where
it
had
been
dropped
in
the
haste
of
flight
a
bottle
of
cocaine
the
bottle
set
me
to
thinking
had
we
a
coke
fiend
on
board
and
if
we
had
who
was
it
the
examination
of
the
hold
led
to
one
curious
and
not
easily
explained
discovery
the
ella
was
in
gravel
ballast
and
my
search
there
was
difficult
and
the
creaking
of
the
girders
and
the
groaning
overhead
of
the
and
once
an
unexpected
list
that
sent
me
careening
head
first
against
a
made
my
position
distinctly
disagreeable
and
above
all
the
incidental
noises
of
a
ship
hold
was
one
that
i
could
not
place
a
regular
knocking
which
kept
time
with
the
list
of
the
boat
i
located
it
at
last
approximately
at
one
of
the
ballast
ports
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
the
port
had
been
carefully
barred
and
calked
over
the
sound
was
not
loud
down
there
among
the
other
noises
i
seemed
to
feel
as
well
as
hear
it
i
sent
burns
down
and
he
came
up
puzzled
it
outside
he
said
something
cracking
against
her
ribs
you
did
notice
it
yesterday
did
you
no
but
yesterday
we
were
not
listening
for
noises
the
knocking
was
on
the
port
side
we
went
forward
together
and
leaning
well
out
looked
over
the
rail
the
missing
marlinespike
was
swinging
there
banging
against
the
hull
with
every
roll
of
the
ship
it
was
fastened
by
a
rope
lanyard
to
a
large
bolt
below
the
rail
and
fastened
with
what
burns
called
a
blackwall
hitch
a
sailor
knot
chapter
xvi
jones
stumbles
over
something
i
find
from
my
journal
that
the
next
seven
days
passed
without
marked
incident
several
times
during
that
period
we
sighted
vessels
all
outward
bound
and
once
we
were
within
communicating
distance
of
a
steam
cargo
boat
on
her
way
to
venezuela
she
lay
to
and
sent
her
first
mate
over
to
see
what
could
be
done
he
was
a
slim
little
man
with
dark
eyes
and
a
small
mustache
above
a
cheerful
mouth
he
listened
in
silence
to
my
story
and
shuddered
when
i
showed
him
the
but
we
were
only
a
few
days
out
by
that
time
and
after
all
what
could
they
do
he
offered
to
spare
us
a
hand
if
it
could
be
arranged
but
adams
having
recovered
by
that
time
we
decided
to
get
along
as
we
were
a
strange
sight
we
must
have
presented
to
the
tidy
little
officer
in
his
uniform
and
black
tie
a
haggard
unshaven
lot
of
men
none
too
clean
all
suffering
from
strain
and
lack
of
sleep
with
nerves
ready
to
snap
a
white
yacht
motionless
her
sails
drooping
for
not
a
breath
of
air
moved
with
unpolished
brasses
and
dirty
decks
in
charge
of
all
a
tall
youth
unshaven
like
the
rest
and
gaunt
from
sickness
who
hardly
knew
a
nautical
phrase
who
shook
the
little
officer
hand
with
a
ferocity
of
welcome
that
made
him
change
color
and
whose
uniform
consisted
of
a
pair
of
dirty
khaki
trousers
and
a
khaki
shirt
open
at
the
neck
and
behind
us
wallowing
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
as
the
ella
lay
to
the
so
miscalled
with
its
sinister
cargo
the
buenos
aires
went
on
leaving
us
a
bit
cheered
perhaps
but
none
the
better
off
except
that
she
verified
our
bearings
the
after
house
had
taken
no
notice
of
the
incident
none
of
the
women
had
appeared
nor
did
they
make
any
inquiry
of
the
cook
when
he
carried
down
their
dinner
that
night
as
entirely
as
possible
during
the
week
that
had
passed
they
had
kept
to
themselves
turner
was
better
i
imagined
but
the
few
times
when
elsa
lee
appeared
at
the
companion
for
a
breath
of
air
i
was
off
duty
and
missed
her
i
thought
it
was
by
design
and
i
was
desperate
for
a
sight
of
her
johns
came
on
deck
once
or
twice
while
i
was
there
but
she
chose
to
ignore
me
the
stewardess
however
was
not
so
partisan
and
the
day
before
we
met
the
buenos
aires
she
spent
a
little
time
on
deck
leaning
against
the
rail
and
watching
me
with
alert
black
eyes
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
get
to
land
captain
leslie
she
asked
are
you
going
to
put
us
all
in
prison
that
as
may
be
i
evaded
she
was
a
pretty
little
woman
plump
and
dark
and
she
slid
her
hand
along
the
rail
until
it
touched
mine
whereon
i
did
the
thing
she
was
expecting
and
put
my
fingers
over
hers
she
flushed
a
little
and
dimpled
you
are
human
are
you
she
asked
archly
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
no
one
is
i
am
sure
silly
why
they
are
all
afraid
of
you
down
there
she
jerked
her
head
toward
the
after
house
they
want
to
offer
you
something
but
none
of
them
will
do
it
offer
me
something
she
came
a
little
closer
so
that
her
round
shoulder
touched
mine
why
not
you
need
money
i
take
it
and
that
the
one
thing
they
have
money
i
began
to
understand
her
i
see
i
said
slowly
they
want
to
bribe
me
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
that
is
a
nasty
word
they
might
wish
to
buy
a
key
or
two
that
you
carry
the
storeroom
key
of
course
but
what
other
she
looked
around
we
were
alone
a
light
breeze
filled
the
sails
and
flicked
the
end
of
a
scarf
she
wore
against
my
face
the
key
to
the
captain
cabin
she
said
very
low
that
was
what
they
wished
to
buy
the
incriminating
key
to
the
storeroom
found
on
turner
floor
and
access
to
the
axe
with
its
telltale
prints
on
the
handle
the
stewardess
saw
my
face
harden
and
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
now
i
am
afraid
of
you
she
cried
when
you
look
like
that
sloane
i
said
i
do
not
know
that
you
were
asked
to
do
this
i
think
not
but
if
you
were
say
for
me
what
i
am
willing
to
say
for
myself
i
shall
tell
what
i
know
and
there
is
not
money
enough
in
the
world
to
prevent
my
telling
it
straight
the
right
man
is
going
to
be
punished
and
the
key
to
the
storeroom
will
be
given
to
the
police
and
to
no
one
else
but
the
other
key
that
is
not
in
my
keeping
i
do
not
believe
you
i
am
sorry
i
said
shortly
as
a
matter
of
fact
burns
has
that
by
the
look
of
triumph
in
her
eyes
i
knew
i
had
told
her
what
she
wanted
to
know
she
went
below
soon
after
and
i
warned
burns
that
he
would
probably
be
approached
in
the
same
way
not
that
i
am
afraid
i
added
but
keep
the
little
sloane
woman
at
a
distance
she
quite
capable
of
mesmerizing
you
with
her
eyes
and
robbing
you
with
her
hands
at
the
same
time
i
rather
you
carry
it
he
said
although
i
not
afraid
of
the
lady
it
not
likely
after
he
did
not
finish
but
he
glanced
aft
toward
the
jollyboat
poor
burns
i
believe
he
had
really
cared
for
the
danish
girl
perhaps
i
was
foolish
but
i
refused
to
take
the
key
from
him
i
felt
sure
he
could
be
trusted
the
murders
had
been
committed
on
the
early
morning
of
wednesday
the
it
was
on
the
following
tuesday
that
sloane
and
i
had
our
little
conversation
on
deck
and
on
wednesday
we
came
up
with
the
buenos
aires
it
was
on
friday
therefore
two
days
after
the
cargo
steamer
had
slid
over
the
edge
of
the
ocean
and
left
us
motionless
a
painted
ship
upon
a
painted
sea
that
the
incident
happened
that
completed
the
demoralization
of
the
crew
for
almost
a
week
the
lookouts
had
reported
all
well
in
response
to
the
striking
of
the
ship
bell
the
hysteria
as
burns
and
i
dubbed
it
of
the
white
figure
had
died
away
as
the
men
nerves
grew
less
irritated
although
we
had
found
no
absolute
explanation
of
the
marlinespike
an
obvious
one
suggested
itself
the
men
although
giving
up
their
weapons
without
protest
had
grumbled
somewhat
over
being
left
without
means
of
defense
it
was
entirely
possible
we
agreed
that
the
marlinespike
had
been
so
disposed
as
some
resort
in
time
of
need
the
cook
taking
down
the
dinner
on
friday
evening
reported
turner
up
and
about
and
partly
dressed
the
heat
was
frightful
all
day
we
had
had
a
following
breeze
and
it
had
been
necessary
to
lengthen
the
dropping
the
well
behind
us
the
men
saying
little
or
nothing
dozed
under
their
canvas
the
helmsman
drooped
at
the
wheel
under
our
feet
the
boards
sent
up
simmering
heat
waves
and
the
brasses
were
too
hot
to
touch
at
four
elsa
lee
came
on
deck
and
spoke
to
me
for
the
first
time
in
several
days
she
started
when
she
saw
me
and
no
wonder
in
the
frenzied
caution
of
the
day
after
the
crimes
i
had
flung
every
razor
overboard
and
the
result
was
as
villainous
a
set
of
men
as
i
have
ever
seen
have
you
been
ill
again
she
asked
i
put
my
hand
to
my
chin
not
ill
i
said
merely
unshaven
but
you
are
pale
and
your
eyes
are
sunk
in
your
head
we
are
very
and
no
one
has
slept
much
or
eaten
at
all
i
imagine
she
said
when
do
we
get
in
i
can
hardly
say
with
this
wind
perhaps
tuesday
where
philadelphia
you
intend
to
turn
the
yacht
over
to
the
police
yes
miss
lee
every
one
on
it
that
is
up
to
the
police
they
will
probably
not
hold
the
women
you
will
be
released
i
imagine
on
your
own
recognizance
and
mr
turner
he
will
have
to
take
his
luck
with
the
rest
of
us
she
asked
me
no
further
questions
but
switched
at
once
to
what
had
brought
her
on
deck
the
cabin
is
unbearable
she
said
we
are
willing
to
take
the
risk
of
opening
the
after
companion
door
but
i
could
not
allow
this
and
i
tried
to
explain
my
reasons
the
crew
were
quartered
there
for
one
for
the
other
whether
they
were
willing
to
take
the
risk
or
not
i
would
not
open
it
without
placing
a
guard
there
and
we
had
no
one
to
spare
for
the
duty
i
suggested
that
they
use
the
part
of
the
deck
reserved
for
them
where
it
was
fairly
cool
under
the
awning
and
after
a
dispute
below
they
agreed
to
this
turner
very
weak
came
up
the
few
steps
slowly
but
refused
my
proffered
help
a
little
later
he
called
me
from
the
rail
and
offered
me
a
cigar
the
change
in
him
was
startling
we
took
advantage
of
their
being
on
deck
to
open
the
windows
and
air
the
after
house
but
all
were
securely
locked
and
barred
before
they
went
below
again
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
all
been
on
deck
together
since
the
night
of
the
it
was
a
different
crowd
of
people
that
sat
there
looking
over
the
rail
and
speaking
in
monosyllables
no
bridge
no
glasses
clinking
with
ice
no
elaborate
toilets
and
carefully
dressed
hair
no
flash
of
jewels
no
light
laughter
following
one
of
poor
vail
sallies
at
ten
they
went
below
but
not
until
i
had
quietly
located
every
member
of
the
crew
i
had
the
watch
from
eight
to
twelve
that
night
and
at
half
after
ten
johns
came
on
deck
again
she
did
not
speak
to
me
but
dropped
into
a
and
yawned
stretching
out
her
arms
by
the
light
of
the
companion
lantern
i
saw
that
she
had
put
on
one
of
the
loose
negligees
she
affected
for
undress
and
her
arms
were
bare
except
for
a
fall
of
lace
at
eight
bells
midnight
burns
took
my
place
charlie
jones
was
at
the
wheel
and
mcnamara
in
the
johns
was
dozing
in
her
chair
the
yacht
was
making
perhaps
four
knots
and
far
behind
the
small
white
light
of
the
showed
where
she
rode
i
slept
heavily
and
at
eight
bells
i
rolled
off
my
blanket
and
prepared
to
relieve
burns
i
was
stiff
weary
unrefreshed
the
air
was
very
still
and
we
were
hardly
moving
i
took
a
pail
of
water
that
stood
near
the
rail
and
leaning
far
out
poured
it
over
my
head
and
shoulders
as
i
turned
dripping
jones
relieved
of
the
wheel
touched
me
on
the
arm
go
back
to
sleep
boy
he
said
kindly
we
need
you
and
we
to
need
you
more
when
we
get
ashore
you
been
talkin
in
your
sleep
till
you
plumb
scared
me
but
i
was
wide
awake
by
that
time
and
he
had
had
as
little
sleep
as
i
had
i
refused
and
we
went
forward
together
jones
to
get
coffee
which
stood
all
night
on
the
galley
stove
it
was
still
dark
the
dawn
even
in
the
less
than
four
weeks
we
had
been
out
came
perceptibly
later
at
the
port
forward
corner
of
the
after
house
jones
stumbled
over
something
and
gave
a
sharp
exclamation
the
next
moment
he
was
on
his
knees
lighting
a
match
burns
lay
there
on
his
face
unconscious
and
bleeding
profusely
from
a
cut
on
the
back
of
his
head
but
not
dead
chapter
xvii
the
axe
is
gone
my
first
thought
was
of
the
after
house
jones
who
had
been
fond
of
burns
was
working
over
him
muttering
to
himself
i
felt
his
heart
which
was
beating
slowly
but
regularly
and
convinced
that
he
was
not
dying
ran
down
into
the
after
house
the
cabin
was
empty
evidently
the
guard
around
the
pearl
handled
revolver
had
been
given
up
on
the
false
promise
of
peace
all
the
lights
were
going
however
and
the
heat
was
suffocating
i
ran
to
miss
lee
door
and
tried
it
it
was
locked
but
almost
instantly
she
spoke
from
inside
what
is
it
nothing
much
can
you
come
out
she
came
a
moment
later
and
i
asked
her
to
call
into
each
cabin
to
see
if
every
one
was
safe
the
result
was
reassuring
no
one
had
been
disturbed
and
i
was
put
to
it
to
account
to
miss
lee
for
my
anxiety
without
telling
her
what
had
happened
i
made
some
sort
of
excuse
which
i
have
forgotten
except
that
she
evidently
did
not
believe
it
on
deck
the
men
were
gathered
around
burns
there
were
ominous
faces
among
them
and
mutterings
of
hatred
and
revenge
for
burns
had
been
popular
the
man
among
them
all
jones
wrought
to
the
highest
pitch
had
even
shed
a
few
shamefaced
tears
and
was
obliterating
the
humiliating
memory
by
an
extra
brusqueness
of
manner
we
carried
the
injured
man
aft
and
with
such
implements
as
i
had
i
cleaned
and
dressed
the
wound
it
needed
sewing
and
it
seemed
best
to
do
it
before
he
regained
consciousness
jones
and
adams
went
below
to
the
forecastle
therefore
and
brought
up
my
amputating
set
which
contained
besides
its
knives
some
curved
needles
and
surgical
silk
still
in
good
condition
i
opened
the
case
and
before
the
knives
the
long
surgeon
knives
which
were
in
use
before
the
scalpel
superseded
them
they
fell
back
muttering
and
amazed
i
did
not
know
that
elsa
lee
also
was
watching
until
having
requested
jones
who
had
been
a
sailmaker
to
thread
the
needles
his
trembling
hands
refused
their
duty
i
looked
up
searching
the
group
for
a
competent
assistant
and
saw
the
girl
she
had
dressed
and
the
light
from
the
lantern
beside
me
on
the
deck
threw
into
relief
her
white
figure
among
the
dark
ones
she
came
forward
as
my
eyes
fell
on
her
let
me
try
she
said
and
kneeling
by
the
lantern
in
a
moment
she
held
out
the
threaded
needle
her
hand
was
quite
steady
she
made
an
able
assistant
wiping
clean
the
oozing
edges
of
the
wound
so
that
i
could
see
to
clip
the
bleeding
vessels
and
working
deftly
with
the
silk
and
needles
to
keep
me
supplied
my
old
case
yielded
also
a
roll
or
so
of
bandage
by
the
time
burns
was
attempting
an
incoordinate
movement
or
two
the
operation
was
over
and
the
instruments
put
out
of
sight
his
condition
was
good
the
men
carried
him
to
the
tent
where
jones
sat
beside
him
and
the
other
men
stood
outside
uneasy
and
watchful
looking
in
the
with
its
knives
came
in
for
its
share
of
scrutiny
and
i
felt
that
an
explanation
was
due
the
men
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
forgotten
all
about
the
case
perhaps
i
swaggered
just
a
bit
as
i
went
over
to
wash
my
hands
it
was
my
first
opportunity
and
i
was
young
and
the
girl
was
there
i
see
you
looking
at
my
case
boys
i
said
perhaps
i
a
little
late
explaining
but
i
guess
after
what
you
seen
you
understand
the
case
belonged
to
my
grandfather
who
was
a
surgeon
he
was
in
the
war
that
case
was
at
gettysburg
and
because
of
your
grandfather
you
brought
it
on
shipboard
clarke
said
nastily
no
i
a
cub
doctor
myself
i
been
sick
and
i
needed
the
sea
and
a
rest
they
were
not
so
impressed
as
i
had
expected
or
perhaps
they
had
known
all
along
sailors
are
a
secretive
lot
i
thinking
we
all
be
getting
a
rest
soon
a
voice
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
knives
i
had
an
inspiration
i
going
to
leave
that
to
you
men
i
said
you
may
throw
them
overboard
if
you
wish
but
if
you
do
take
out
the
needles
and
the
silk
we
may
need
them
there
followed
a
savage
but
restrained
argument
among
the
men
jones
from
the
tent
called
out
irritably
do
be
fools
you
fellows
this
happened
while
leslie
was
asleep
i
swear
he
never
moved
after
he
lay
down
the
crew
reached
a
decision
shortly
after
that
and
came
to
me
in
a
body
we
think
oleson
said
that
we
lock
them
in
the
captain
cabin
with
the
axe
very
well
i
said
burns
has
the
key
around
his
neck
clarke
i
think
it
was
went
into
the
tent
and
came
out
again
directly
there
no
key
around
his
neck
he
said
gruffly
it
may
have
slipped
around
under
his
back
it
is
there
at
all
i
ran
into
the
tent
where
jones
having
exhausted
the
resources
of
the
injured
man
clothing
was
searching
among
the
blankets
on
which
he
lay
there
was
no
key
i
went
out
to
the
men
again
bewildered
the
dawn
had
come
a
pink
and
rosy
dawn
that
promised
another
stifling
day
it
revealed
the
disarray
of
the
deck
the
basins
the
old
mahogany
with
its
lock
plate
of
bone
the
stained
and
reddened
towels
and
it
showed
the
brooding
and
overcast
faces
of
the
men
is
it
there
i
asked
our
agreement
was
for
me
to
carry
the
key
to
singleton
cabin
and
burns
the
captain
miss
lee
by
the
rail
came
forward
slowly
and
looked
up
at
me
is
it
possible
she
said
that
knowing
where
the
key
was
some
one
wished
to
get
it
and
so
she
indicated
the
tent
and
burns
i
knew
then
how
dull
i
had
been
and
stupid
the
men
caught
her
meaning
too
and
we
tramped
heavily
forward
the
girl
and
i
leading
the
door
into
the
captain
room
was
open
and
the
axe
was
gone
from
the
bunk
the
key
with
the
cord
that
burns
had
worn
around
his
neck
was
in
the
door
the
string
torn
and
pulled
as
if
it
had
been
jerked
away
from
the
unconscious
man
later
on
we
verified
this
by
finding
on
the
back
of
burns
neck
an
abraded
line
two
inches
or
so
in
length
it
was
a
strong
cord
the
kind
a
sailor
pins
his
faith
to
and
uses
indiscriminately
to
hold
his
trousers
or
his
knife
i
ordered
a
rigid
search
of
the
deck
but
the
axe
was
gone
nor
was
it
ever
found
it
had
taken
its
bloody
story
many
fathoms
deep
into
the
old
atlantic
and
hidden
it
where
many
crimes
have
been
hidden
in
the
ooze
and
slime
of
the
that
day
was
memorable
for
more
than
the
attack
on
burns
it
marked
a
complete
revolution
in
my
idea
of
the
earlier
crimes
and
of
the
criminal
two
things
influenced
my
change
of
mental
attitude
the
attack
on
burns
was
one
i
did
not
believe
that
turner
had
strength
enough
to
fell
so
vigorous
a
man
even
with
the
capstan
bar
which
we
found
lying
near
by
nor
could
he
have
jerked
and
broken
the
amberline
johns
i
eliminated
for
the
same
reason
of
course
i
could
imagine
her
getting
the
key
by
subtlety
wheedling
the
impressionable
young
sailor
into
compliance
but
force
the
second
reason
was
the
stronger
singleton
the
mate
had
become
a
tractable
and
almost
amiable
prisoner
like
turner
he
was
ugly
only
when
he
was
drinking
and
there
was
not
even
enough
liquor
on
the
ella
to
revive
poor
burns
he
spent
his
days
devising
with
bits
of
wire
a
ring
puzzle
that
he
intended
should
make
his
fortune
and
i
believe
he
contrived
finally
a
clever
enough
bit
of
foolery
he
was
anxious
to
talk
and
complained
bitterly
of
loneliness
using
every
excuse
to
hold
tom
the
cook
when
he
carried
him
his
meals
he
had
asked
for
a
bible
too
and
read
it
now
and
then
the
morning
of
burns
injury
i
visited
singleton
the
new
outrage
coming
at
a
time
when
they
were
slowly
recovering
confidence
had
turned
the
men
surly
the
loss
of
the
axe
the
handle
of
which
i
had
told
them
would
under
skillful
eyes
reveal
the
murderer
as
accurately
as
a
photograph
was
a
serious
blow
again
arose
the
specter
of
the
innocent
suffering
for
the
guilty
they
went
doggedly
about
their
work
and
wherever
they
gathered
there
was
muttered
talk
of
the
white
figure
there
was
grumbling
too
over
their
lack
of
weapons
for
defense
the
cook
was
a
ringleader
of
the
malcontents
certain
utensils
were
allowed
him
but
he
was
compelled
at
night
to
lock
them
in
the
galley
after
either
burns
inspection
or
mine
and
to
turn
over
the
key
to
one
of
us
on
the
morning
after
the
attack
therefore
tom
carrying
breakfast
to
him
told
him
at
length
what
had
occurred
in
the
night
and
dilated
on
his
lack
of
should
an
attack
be
directed
toward
him
singleton
promptly
offered
to
make
him
out
of
wire
a
key
to
the
galley
door
so
that
he
could
get
what
he
wanted
from
it
the
cook
was
to
take
an
impression
of
the
lock
in
exchange
tom
was
to
fetch
him
from
a
hiding
place
which
singleton
designated
in
the
forward
house
a
bottle
of
whiskey
the
cook
was
a
shrewd
mulatto
and
he
let
singleton
make
the
key
it
was
after
ten
that
morning
when
he
brought
it
to
me
i
was
trying
to
get
the
details
of
his
injury
from
burns
at
the
time
in
the
tent
i
did
see
or
hear
anything
leslie
burns
said
feebly
i
even
remember
being
hit
i
felt
there
was
some
one
behind
me
that
was
all
there
had
been
nothing
suspicious
earlier
in
the
night
he
lay
thinking
he
was
still
somewhat
confused
no
i
think
not
or
yes
i
thought
once
i
saw
some
one
standing
by
the
mainmast
behind
it
it
was
how
long
was
johns
on
deck
not
long
did
she
ask
you
to
do
something
for
her
pale
as
he
was
he
colored
but
he
eyed
me
honestly
yes
do
ask
me
any
more
leslie
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
what
did
she
ask
you
to
do
i
persisted
remorselessly
i
do
want
to
talk
my
head
aches
very
well
then
i
tell
you
what
happened
after
i
went
off
watch
no
i
was
spying
i
know
the
woman
that
all
she
said
you
looked
tired
and
would
it
be
all
right
if
you
sat
down
for
a
moment
and
talked
to
her
no
she
said
she
was
nervous
the
same
thing
only
better
then
she
persisted
in
talking
of
the
crime
and
finally
she
said
she
would
like
to
see
the
axe
it
do
any
harm
she
would
touch
it
he
watched
me
uneasily
she
did
either
he
said
i
swear
to
that
leslie
she
go
near
the
bunk
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
leaned
against
the
door
i
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
against
the
door
of
course
and
got
an
impression
of
the
key
the
door
opens
in
she
could
take
out
the
key
press
it
against
a
cake
of
wax
or
even
a
cake
of
soap
in
her
hand
and
slip
it
back
into
the
lock
again
while
you
what
were
you
doing
while
she
was
doing
all
that
she
dropped
her
salts
i
picked
them
up
exactly
well
the
axe
is
gone
he
started
up
on
his
elbow
gone
thrown
overboard
probably
it
is
not
in
the
cabin
it
was
brutal
perhaps
but
the
situation
was
all
of
that
as
burns
fell
back
colorless
tom
the
cook
brought
into
the
tent
the
wire
key
that
singleton
had
made
that
morning
i
took
from
inside
of
singleton
mattress
a
bunch
of
keys
a
long
steel
file
and
the
leg
of
one
of
his
chairs

unscrewed
and
wrapped
at
the
end
with
wire

was

chapter

a
bad
combination
we
picked
up
a
pilot
outside
the
lewes
breakwater
a
man
of
few
words
i
told
him
only
the
outlines
of
our
story
and
i
believe
he
half
discredited
me
at
first
god
knows
i
was
not
a
creditable
object
when
i
took
him
aft
and
showed
him
the
he
realized
at
last
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
a
great
tragedy
and
paid
it
the
tribute
of
throwing
away
his
cigar
he
suggested
our
raising
the
yellow
plague

and
this
we
did
with
a
ready
response

turner
line
met
him
at
the
rail
and
conducted
him
with
a
sort
of
chastened
affability
to
the
cabin
exhausted
from
lack
of
sleep
terrified
with
what
had
gone
by
and
what
was
yet
to
come
unshaven
and
unkempt
the
men
gathered
on
the
and
waited
the
conference
below
lasted
perhaps
an
hour
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
quarantine
officer
came
up
and
shouted
a
direction
from
below
as
a
result
of
which
the
was
cut
loose
and
towed
by
the
tug
taken
to
the
quarantine
station
there
was
an
argument
i
believe
between
turner
and
the
officer
as
to
allowing
us
to
proceed
up
the
river
without
waiting
for
the
police
turner
prevailed
however
and
from
the
time
we
hoisted
the
yellow
flag
we
were
on
our
way
to
the
city
a
tug
panting
beside
us
urging
the
broad
and
comfortable
lines
of
the
old
cargo
boat
to
a
semblance
of
speed
the
quarantine
officer
a
dapper
little
man
remained
on
the
boat
and
busied
himself
officiously
getting
the
names
of
the
men
peering
at
singleton
through
his
barred
window
and
expressing
disappointment
at
my
lack
of
foresight
in
having
the
bloodstains
cleared
away
every
stain
is
a
clue
my
man
to
the
trained
eye
he
chirruped
with
an
axe
too
what
a
brutal
method
brutal
where
is
the
axe
gone
i
said
patiently
it
was
stolen
out
of
the
captain
cabin
he
eyed
me
over
his
glasses
that
very
strange
he
commented
no
stains
no
axe
you
fellows
have
been
mighty
careful
to
destroy
the
evidence
have
you
all
that
long
day
we
made
our
deliberate
progress
up
the
river
the
luggage
from
the
after
house
was
carried
up
on
deck
by
adams
and
clarke
and
stood
waiting
for
the
customhouse
turner
his
hands
behind
him
paced
the
deck
hour
by
hour
his
heavy
face
colorless
his
wife
dark
repressed
with
a
look
of
being
always
on
guard
watched
him
furtively
johns
dressed
in
black
talked
to
the
doctor
and
from
the
notes
he
made
i
knew
she
was
telling
the
story
of
the
tragedy
and
here
there
and
everywhere
efficient
normal
and
so
lovely
that
it
hurt
me
to
look
at
her
was
elsa
williams
the
butler
had
emerged
from
his
chrysalis
of
fright
and
was
ostentatiously
looking
after
the
family
comfort
no
clearer
indication
could
have
been
given
of
the
new
status
of
affairs
than
his
changed
attitude
toward
me
he
came
up
to
me
early
in
the
afternoon
and
demanded
that
i
wash
down
the
deck
before
the
women
came
up
i
smiled
down
at
him
cheerfully
williams
i
said
you
are
a
coward
a
mean
coward
you
have
skulked
in
the
after
house
behind
women
when
there
was
work
to
do
if
i
wash
that
deck
it
will
be
with
you
as
a
mop
he
blustered
something
about
speaking
to
turner
and
seeing
that
i
did
the
work
i
was
brought
on
board
to
do
and
seeing
turner
eye
on
us
finished
his
speech
with
an
ugly
epithet
my
nerves
were
strained
to
the
utmost
lack
of
sleep
and
food
had
done
their
work
i
was
no
longer
in
command
of
the
ella
i
was
a
common
sailor
ready
to
vent
my
spleen
through
my
fists
i
knocked
him
down
with
my
open
hand
it
was
a
barbarous
and
a
reckless
thing
to
do
he
picked
himself
up
and
limped
away
muttering
turner
had
watched
the
scene
with
his
cold
blue
eyes
and
the
little
doctor
with
his
ones
a
dangerous
man
that
said
the
doctor
dangerous
and
intelligent
replied
turner
a
bad
combination
it
was
late
that
night
when
the
ella
anchored
in
the
river
at
philadelphia
we
were
not
allowed
to
land
the
police
took
charge
of
ship
crew
and
passengers
the
men
slept
heavily
on
deck
except
burns
who
developed
a
slight
fever
from
his
injury
and
moved
about
restlessly
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
vigilance
of
the
officers
was
exerted
largely
to
prevent
an
escape
from
the
vessel
and
not
sufficiently
for
the
safety
of
those
on
board
i
spoke
of
this
and
a
guard
was
placed
at
the
companionway
again
thus
i
saw
elsa
lee
for
the
last
time
until
the
trial
she
was
dressed
as
she
had
been
in
the
afternoon
in
a
dark
cloth
suit
of
some
sort
and
i
did
not
see
her
until
i
had
spoken
to
the
officer
in
charge
she
turned
at
my
voice
and
called
me
to
join
her
where
she
stood
we
are
back
again
leslie
yes
miss
lee
back
to
what
to
live
the
whole
thing
over
again
in
a
courtroom
if
only
we
could
go
away
anywhere
and
try
to
forget
she
had
not
expected
any
answer
and
i
had
none
ready
i
was
thinking
heaven
help
me
that
there
were
things
i
would
not
forget
if
i
could
the
lift
of
her
lashes
as
she
looked
up
at
me
the
few
words
we
had
had
together
the
day
she
had
told
me
the
deck
was
not
clean
the
night
i
had
touched
her
hand
with
my
lips
we
are
to
be
released
i
believe
she
said
on
our
own
some
legal
term
i
forget
it
recognizance
probably
yes
you
do
not
know
law
as
well
as
medicine
i
am
sorry
no
and
i
know
very
little
medicine
but
you
sewed
up
a
wound
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
admitted
that
was
my
initial
performance
and
it
is
badly
done
it
it
puckers
she
turned
on
me
a
trifle
impatiently
why
do
you
make
such
a
secret
of
your
identity
she
demanded
is
it
a
pose
or
have
you
a
reason
for
concealing
it
it
is
not
a
pose
and
i
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
unless
poverty
of
course
not
what
do
you
mean
by
poverty
the
common
garden
variety
sort
i
have
hardly
a
dollar
in
the
world
as
to
my
identity
if
it
interests
you
at
all
i
graduated
in
medicine
last
june
i
spent
the
last
of
the
money
that
was
to
educate
me
in
purchasing
a
dress
suit
to
graduate
in
and
a
supper
by
way
of
celebration
the
dress
suit
helped
me
to
my
diploma
the
supper
gave
me
typhoid
so
that
was
it
not
jail
you
see
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
i
glanced
around
to
where
a
police
officer
stood
behind
us
watchfully
now
why
now
i
go
to
jail
in
earnest
you
have
been
very
good
to
us
she
said
wistfully
we
have
all
been
strained
and
nervous
maybe
you
have
not
thought
i
noticed
or
or
appreciated
what
you
were
doing
but
i
have
always
you
have
given
all
of
yourself
for
us
you
have
not
slept
or
eaten
and
now
you
are
going
to
be
imprisoned
it
is
just
i
tried
to
speak
lightly
to
reassure
her
do
be
unhappy
about
that
i
said
a
nice
safe
jail
where
one
may
sleep
and
eat
and
eat
and
sleep
oh
i
shall
be
very
comfortable
and
if
you
wish
to
make
me
exceedingly
happy
you
will
see
that
they
let
me
have
a
razor
but
to
my
surprise
she
buried
her
face
in
her
arms
i
could
not
believe
at
first
that
she
was
crying
the
policeman
had
wandered
across
to
the
other
rail
and
stood
looking
out
at
the
city
lights
his
back
to
us
i
put
my
hand
out
to
touch
her
soft
hair
then
drew
it
back
i
could
not
take
advantage
of
her
sympathy
of
the
hysterical
excitement
of
that
last
night
on
the
ella
i
put
my
hands
in
my
pockets
and
held
them
there
clenched
lest
in
spite
of
my
will
i
reach
out
to
take
her
in
my
arms
chapter
xix
i
take
the
stand
and
now
i
come
with
some
hesitation
to
the
trial
hesitation
because
i
relied
on
mcwhirter
to
keep
a
record
and
mcwhirter
from
his
notes
appears
to
have
been
carried
away
at
times
by
excitement
and
either
jotted
down
rows
of
unintelligible
words
or
waited
until
evening
and
made
up
his
notes
like
a
woman
expense
account
from
a
memory
never
noticeable
for
accuracy
at
dawn
the
morning
after
we
anchored
charlie
jones
roused
me
grinning
friend
of
yours
over
the
rail
leslie
he
said
wants
to
take
you
ashore
i
knew
no
one
in
philadelphia
except
the
chap
who
had
taken
me
yachting
once
and
i
felt
pretty
certain
that
he
would
not
associate
leslie
the
football
player
with
leslie
the
sailor
on
the
ella
i
went
reluctantly
to
the
rail
and
looked
down
below
me
just
visible
in
the
river
mist
of
the
early
morning
was
a
small
boat
from
which
two
men
were
looking
up
one
was
mcwhirter
hello
old
top
he
cried
or
is
it
you
behind
that
beard
it
i
all
right
mac
i
said
somewhat
huskily
what
with
seeing
him
again
his
kindly
face
behind
its
glasses
the
cheerful
faith
in
me
which
was
his
contribution
to
our
friendship
even
the
way
he
shook
his
own
hand
in
default
of
mine
my
throat
tightened
here
after
all
was
home
and
a
friend
he
looked
up
at
the
rail
and
motioned
to
a
rope
that
hung
there
get
your
stuff
and
come
with
us
for
breakfast
he
said
you
look
as
if
you
had
eaten
since
you
left
i
afraid
i
ca
mac
they
not
going
to
hold
you
are
they
for
a
day
or
so
yes
mac
reply
to
this
was
a
violent
resume
of
the
ancestry
and
present
lost
condition
of
the
philadelphia
police
ending
with
a
request
that
i
jump
over
and
let
them
go
to
the
place
he
had
just
designated
as
their
in
eternity
on
an
officer
lounging
to
the
rail
and
looking
down
however
he
subsided
into
a
low
muttering
the
story
of
how
mcwhirter
happened
to
be
floating
on
the
bosom
of
the
delaware
river
before
five
in
the
morning
was
a
long
one
it
was
months
before
i
got
it
in
full
briefly
going
home
from
the
theater
in
new
york
the
night
before
he
had
bought
an
extra
which
had
contained
a
brief
account
of
the
ella
return
he
seems
to
have
gone
into
a
frenzy
of
excitement
at
once
he
borrowed
a
small
car
one
scornfully
designated
as
a
road
louse
and
assembled
in
it
in
wild
confusion
one
suit
of
clothes
for
me
his
own
and
much
too
small
one
hypodermic
case
an
armful
of
newspapers
with
red
a
bottle
of
brandy
a
bottle
of
digitalis
one
police
card
and
one
excited
young
lawyer
of
the
same
vintage
in
law
that
mac
and
i
were
in
medicine
at
the
last
moment
fearful
that
the
police
might
not
know
who
i
was
he
had
flung
in
a
scrapbook
in
which
he
had
pasted
with
a
glue
that
was
to
make
his
fortune
records
of
my
exploits
on
the
football
field
a
dozen
miles
from
philadelphia
the
little
machine
had
turned
over
on
a
curve
knocking
all
the
law
and
most
of
the
enthusiasm
out
of
walters
the
legal
gentleman
and
smashing
the
mcwhirter
had
picked
himself
up
kicked
viciously
at
the
car
and
gathering
up
his
impedimenta
had
made
the
rest
of
the
journey
by
foot
and
his
wrath
at
finding
me
a
prisoner
was
unbounded
his
scorn
at
walters
the
attorney
for
not
confounding
the
police
with
law
enough
to
free
me
was
furious
and
contemptuous
he
picked
up
the
oars
in
sullen
silence
and
leaning
on
them
called
a
loud
and
defiant
farewell
for
the
benefit
of
the
officer
all
right
he
said
an
hour
or
so
wo
make
much
difference
but
you
be
free
today
all
right
all
right
and
do
let
them
bluff
you
boy
if
the
police
get
funny
tackle
them
and
throw
overboard
one
by
one
you
can
do
it
he
made
an
insulting
gesture
at
the
police
picked
up
his
oars
and
rowed
away
into
the
mist
but
i
was
not
free
that
day
nor
for
many
days
as
i
had
expected
turner
his
family
johns
and
the
stewardess
were
released
after
examination
the
rest
of
us
were
taken
to
jail
singleton
as
a
suspect
the
others
to
make
sure
of
their
presence
at
the
trial
the

and
early
morning
of
august
i
slept
in
the
storeroom
in
the
after
house
as
it
was
very
hot
i
always
left
the
door
open
the
storeroom
itself
was
a
small
room
lined
with
shelves
and
reached
by
a
passageway
the
door
was
at
the
end
of
the
passage
i
wakened
because
of
the
heat
and
found
the
door
locked
on
the
outside
i
lit
a
match
and
found
i
could
unscrew
the
lock
with
my
knife
i
thought
i
had
been
locked
in
as
a
joke
by
the
crew
while
i
was
kneeling
some
one
passed
outside
the
door
how
did
you
know
that
i
felt
a
board
rise
under
my
knee
as
if
the
other
end
had
been
trod
on
shortly
after
a
woman
screamed
and
i
burst
open
the
door
how
long
after
you
felt
the
board
rise
perhaps
a
minute
possibly
two
go
on
just
after
the
ship
bell
struck
six
three
the
main
cabin
was
dark
there
was
a
light
in
the
from
the
binnacle
light
i
felt
my
way
to
vail
room
i
heard
him
breathing
his
door
was
open
i
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
him
he
had
stopped
breathing
what
was
the
state
of
his
bunk
disordered
horrible
he
was
almost
hacked
to
pieces
go
on
i
ran
back
and
got
my
revolver
i
thought
there
had
been
a
confine
yourself
to
what
you
saw
and
did
the
court
is
not
interested
in
what
you
thought
i
am
only
trying
to
explain
what
i
did
i
ran
back
to
the
storeroom
and
got
my
revolver
and
ran
back
through
the
to
the
after
companion
which
had
a
hood
i
thought
that
if
any
one
was
lying
in
ambush
the
hood
would
protect
me
until
i
could
get
to
the
deck
i
told
the
helmsman
what
had
happened
and
ran
forward
singleton
was
on
the
we
went
below
together
and
found
the
captain
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
forward
companion
also
dead
at
this
time
had
you
called
the
owner
of
the
ship
no
i
called
him
then
but
i
could
not
rouse
him
explain
what
you
mean
by
that
he
had
been
drinking
there
followed
a
furious
wrangle
over
this
point
but
the
prosecuting
attorney
succeeded
in
having
question
and
answer
stand
what
did
you
do
next
the
mate
had
called
the
crew
i
wakened
turner
miss
lee
and
johns
and
then
went
to
the
to
call
the
women
there
the
door
was
open
an
inch
or
so
i
received
no
answer
to
my
knock
and
pulled
it
open
karen
hansen
the
maid
was
dead
on
the
floor
and
the
stewardess
was
in
her
bunk
in
a
state
of
collapse
state
where
you
found
the
axe
with
which
the
crimes
were
committed
it
was
found
in
the
stewardess
bunk
where
is
this
axe
now
it
was
stolen
from
the
captain
cabin
where
it
was
locked
for
safe
keeping
and
presumably
thrown
overboard
at
least
we
did
find
it
i
see
you
are
consulting
a
book
to
refresh
your
memory
what
is
this
book
the
ship
log
how
does
it
happen
to
be
in
your
possession
the
crew
appointed
me
captain
as
such
i
kept
the
it
contains
a
full
account
of
the
discovery
of
the
bodies
witnessed
by
all
the
men
is
it
in
your
writing
yes
it
is
in
my
writing
you
read
it
to
the
men
and
they
signed
it
no
they
read
it
themselves
before
they
signed
it
after
a
wrangle
as
to
my
having
authority
to
make
a
record
in
the
the
prosecuting
attorney
succeeded
in
having
the
book
admitted
as
evidence
and
read
to
the
jury
the
entry
of
august
having
thus
proved
the
crimes
i
was
excused
to
be
recalled
later
the
defense
reserving
its
the
doctor
from
the
quarantine
station
was
called
next
and
testified
to
the
manner
of
death
his
testimony
was
revolting
and
bears
in
no
way
on
the
story
save
in
one
particular
a
curious
uniformity
in
the
mutilation
of
the
bodies
of
vail
and
captain
richardson
a
sinister
similarity
that
was
infinitely
shocking
in
each
case
the
forehead
the
two
arms
and
the
abdomen
had
received
a
frightful
blow
in
the
case
of
the
danish
girl
there
was

your
position
on
the
yacht

before
that
on
the
baltic
between
liverpool
and
new
york
that
was
how
i
met
mrs
turner
where
was
your
room
on
the
yacht
ella
off
the
chartroom
will
you
indicate
it
on
this
diagram
it
was
there
pointing
the
diagram
was
shown
to
the
jury
there
are
two
bunks
in
this
room
which
was
yours
the
one
at
the
side
the
one
opposite
the
door
was
karen
tell
what
happened
on
the
night
of
august
and
morning
of
the
i
went
to
bed
early
karen
hansen
had
not
come
down
by
midnight
when
i
opened
the
door
i
saw
why
turner
and
singleton
were
there
drinking
the
defense
objected
to
this
but
was
overruled
by
the
court
vail
was
trying
to
persuade
the
mate
to
go
on
deck
before
the
captain
came
down
did
they
go
no
what
comment
did
singleton
make
he
said
he
hoped
the
captain
would
come
he
wanted
a
chance
to
get
at
him
what
happened
after
that
the
captain
came
down
and
ordered
the
mate
on
deck
vail
and
the
captain
got
turner
to
his
room
how
do
you
know
that
i
opened
my
door
what
then
karen
came
down
at
we
went
to
bed
at
ten
minutes
to
three
the
bell
rang
for
karen
she
got
up
and
put
on
a
wrapper
and
slippers
she
was
grumbling
and
i
told
her
to
put
out
the
light
and
let
me
sleep
as
she
opened
the
door
she
screamed
and
fell
back
on
the
floor
something
struck
me
on
the
shoulder
and
i
fainted
i
learned
later
it
was
the
axe
did
you
hear
any
sound
outside
before
you
opened
the
door
a
curious
chopping
sound
i
spoke
of
it
to
her
it
came
from
the
when
the
girl
fell
back
into
the
room
did
you
see
any
one
beyond
her
i
saw
something
i
could
say
just
what
was
what
you
saw
a
figure
i
i
am
not
certain
it
was
light
almost
white
can
you
not
describe
it
i
am
afraid
not
except
that
it
seemed
white
how
tall
was
it
i
could
say
as
tall
as
the
girl
just
about
perhaps
think
of
something
that
it
resembled
this
is
important
sloane
you
must
make
an
effort
i
think
it
looked
most
like
a
fountain
even
the
jury
laughed
at
this
and
yet
after
all
sloane
was
right
or
nearly
so
that
is
curious
how
did
it
resemble
a
fountain
perhaps
i
should
have
said
a
fountain
in
moonlight
white
and
misty
and
and
flowing
and
yet
this
object
threw
the
axe
at
you
did
it
there
was
an
objection
to
the
form
of
this
question
but
the
court
overruled
it
i
did
not
say
it
threw
the
axe
i
did
not
see
it
thrown
i
felt
it
did
you
know
the
first
mate
singleton
before
you
met
on
the
ella
yes
sir
where
we
were
on
the
same
vessel
two
years
ago
the
american
for
bermuda
were
you
friends
yes
very
low
were
you
engaged
to
marry
him
at
one
time
yes
why
did
you
break
it
off
we
differed
about
a
good
many
things
after
a
long
battle
the
prosecuting
attorney
was
allowed
to
show
that
following
the
breaking
off
of
her
relations
with
singleton
she
had
been
a
witness
against
him
in
an
case
and
had
testified
to
his
violence
of
temper
the
dispute
took
so
long
that
there
was
only
time
for
her
the
effect
of
the
evidence
so
far
was
distinctly
bad
for
singleton
his
attorney
a
young
and
intelligent
jew
sloane
attorney
for
the
defense
did
you
ever
write
a
letter
to
the
defendant
sloane
threatening
him
if
he
did
not
marry
you
i
do
not
recall
such
a
letter
is
this
letter
in
your
writing
i
think
so
yes
sloane
you
testify
that
you
opened
your
door
and
saw
vail
and
the
captain
taking
turner
to
his
room
is
this
correct
yes
why
did
they
take
him
i
mean
was
he
not
able
apparently
to
walk
alone
he
was
able
to
walk
they
walked
beside
him
in
your
testimony
taken
at
the
time
and
entered
in
the
ship
log
you
say
you
by
the
sounds
here
you
say
you
the
door
and
saw
them
which
is
correct
i
saw
them
you
say
that
singleton
said
he
wished
to
at
the
captain
are
those
his
exact
words
i
do
not
recall
his
exact
words
perhaps
i
can
refresh
your
mind
with
the
permission
of
the
court
i
shall
read
from
the
ship
log
this
woman
statement
recorded
by
the
man
who
was
in
charge
of
the
vessel
and
therefore
competent
to
make
such
record
and
signed
by
the
witness
as
having
been
read
and
approved
by
her
singleton
said
that
he
hoped
the
captain
would
come
as
he
and
turner
only
wanted
a
chance
to
get
at
him
there
was
a
sound
outside
and
karen
thought
it
was
turner
falling
over
something
and
said
that
she
hoped
she
would
not
meet
him
once
or
twice
when
he
had
been
drinking
he
had
made
overtures
to
her
and
she
detested
him
she
opened
the
door
and
came
back
into
the
room
touching
me
on
the
arm
that
beast
is
out
there
she
said
sitting
on
the
companion
steps
if
he
tries
to
stop
me
i
call
you
the
reading
made
a
profound
impression
the
prosecution
having
succeeded
in
having
the
log
admitted
as
evidence
had
put
a
trump
card
in
the
hands
of
the
defense
what
were
the
relations
between
turner
and
the
captain
i
do
know
what
you
mean
were
they
friendly
no
not
very
did
you
overhear
on
the
night
of
august
a
conversation
between
turner
and
mr
vail
yes
what
was
its
nature
they
were
quarreling
what
did
williams
the
butler
give
you
to
hide
that
night
turner
revolver
what
did
he
say
when
he
gave
it
to
you
he
said
to
throw
it
overboard
or
there
would
be
trouble
sloane
do
you
recognize
these
two
garments
he
held
up
a
man
dinner
shirt
and
a
white
waistcoat
the
stewardess
who
had
been
calm
enough
started
and
paled
i
can
not
tell
without
examining
them
they
were
given
to
her
and
she
looked
at
them
yes
i
have
seen
them
what
are
they
a
shirt
and
waistcoat
of
mr
turner
when
did
you
see
them
last
i
packed
them
in
my
trunk
when
we
left
the
boat
they
had
been
forgotten
when
the
other
trunks
were
packed
had
you
washed
them
no
were
they
washed
on
shipboard
they
look
like
it
they
have
not
been
ironed
who
gave
them
to
you
to
pack
in
your
trunk
mrs
johns
what
did
you
do
with
them
on
reaching
new
york
i
left
them
in
my
trunk
why
did
you
not
return
them
to
mr
turner
i
was
ill
and
forgot
i
like
to
know
what
right
you
have
going
through
a
person
things
and
taking
what
you
want
the
stewardess
was
excused
the
defense
having
scored
perceptibly
it
was
clear
what
line
the
young
jew
intended
to
follow
oleson
the
swede
was
called
next
and
after
the
usual
formalities
where
were
you
between
midnight
and
on
the
morning
of
august
in
the
of
the
ella
state
what
you
saw
between
midnight
and
one
i
saw
mate
singleton
walking
on
the
every
now
and
then
he
went
to
the
rail
he
seemed
to
be
vomiting
it
was
too
dark
to
see
much
then
he
went
aft
along
the
port
side
of
the
house
and
came
forward
again
on
the
starboard
side
he
went
to
where
the
axe
was
kept
where
was
that
near
the
starboard
corner
of
the
forward
house
all
the
turner
boats
have
an
emergency
box
with
an
axe
and
other
tools
in
easy
reach
the
officer
on
watch
carried
the
key
could
you
see
what
he
was
doing
no
but
he
was
fumbling
at
the
box
i
heard
him
where
did
he
go
after
that
he
went
aft
you
could
not
see
him
i
did
look
i
thought
i
saw
something
white
moving
below
me
and
i
was
watching
it
this
white
thing
what
did
it
look
like
like
a
dog
i
should
say
it
moved
about
and
then
disappeared
how
i
do
understand
over
the
rail
oh
no
sir
it
faded
away
had
you
ever
heard
talk
among
the
men
of
the
ella
being
a
haunted
ship
yes
but
not
until
after
i
signed
on
her
was
there
some
talk
of
this
thing
yes
before
the
murders
no
sir
not
till
after
i
guess
i
saw
it
first
what
did
the
men
say
about
it
they
thought
it
scared
schwartz
overboard
the
ella
been
unlucky
as
to
crews
they
call
her
a
ship
did
you
see
singleton
on
deck
between
two
and
three
no
sir
the
was
very
short
what
sort
of
night
was
it
very
dark
would
the
first
mate
as
officer
on
watch
be
supposed
to
see
that
the
emergency
case
you
speak
of
was
in
order
yes
sir
did
the
officer
on
watch
remain
on
the
schwartz
did
not
singleton
did
mostly
except
when
he
went
back
to
strike
the
bells
could
singleton
have
been
on
deck
without
you
seeing
him
yes
if
he
did
not
move
around
or
smoke
i
could
see
his
pipe
lighted
did
you
see
his
pipe
that
night
no
sir
if
you
were
sick
would
you
be
likely
to
smoke
this
question
i
believe
was
ruled
out
in
case
the
wheel
of
the
vessel
were
lashed
for
a
short
time
what
would
happen
depends
on
the
weather
she
be
likely
to
come
to
or
fall
off
considerable
would
the
lookout
know
it
yes
sir
how
the
sails
would
show
it
sir
that
closed
the
proceedings
for
the
day
the
crowd
seemed
reluctant
to
disperse
turner
lawyers
were
in
troubled
consultation
with
him
singleton
was
markedly
more
cheerful
and
i
thought
the
prosecution
looked
perturbed
and
uneasy
i
went
back
to
jail
that
night
and
dreamed
of
elsa
not
as
i
had
seen
her
that
day
bending
forward
watching
every
point
of
the
evidence
but
as
i
had
seen
her
so
often
on
the
yacht
facing
into
the
salt
breeze
as
if
she
loved
it
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
her
short
white
jacket
her
hair
blowing
back
from
her
forehead
in
damp
rings
chapter
xxi
a
bad
woman
charlie
jones
was
called
first
on
the
second
day
of
the
trial
he
gave
his
place
of
birth
as
pennsylvania
and
his
present
shore
address
as
a
sailors
christian
home
in
new
york
he
offered
without
solicitation
the
information
that
he
had
been
years
in
the
turner
service
and
could
have
been
up
at
the
top
but
preferred
the
forecastle
so
that
he
could
be
an
influence
to
the
men
his
rolling
gait
twinkling
blue
eyes
and
huge
mustache
as
well
as
the
plug
of
tobacco
which
he
sliced
with
a
huge
knife
put
the
crowd
in
good
humor
and
relieved
somewhat
the
somberness
of
the
proceedings
where
were
you
between
midnight
and
on
the
morning
of
august
at
the
wheel
you
did
not
leave
the
wheel
during
that
time
yes
sir
when
was
that
after
they
found
the
captain
body
i
went
to
the
forward
companion
and
looked
down
is
a
helmsman
permitted
to
leave
his
post
with
the
captain
lying
dead
down
in
a
pool
of
blood
i
should
never
mind
thinking
is
he
no
what
did
you
do
with
the
wheel
when
you
left
it
lashed
it
there
are
two
with
loops
to
lash
it
with
when
i
was
on
the
sarah
winters
stick
to
the
question
did
you
see
the
mate
singleton
during
your
watch
every
from
to
he
struck
the
bells
after
that
he
said
he
was
sick
he
thought
he
been
poisoned
he
said
he
was
going
forward
to
lie
down
and
for
me
to
strike
them
who
struck
the
bell
at
three
i
did
sir
when
did
you
hear
a
woman
scream
just
before
that
what
did
you
do
nothing
it
was
the
hansen
woman
i
did
like
her
she
was
a
bad
woman
when
i
told
her
what
she
was
she
laughed
were
you
ever
below
in
the
after
house
no
sir
not
since
the
boat
was
fixed
up
what
could
you
see
through
the
window
beside
the
wheel
it
looked
into
the
if
the
light
was
on
i
could
see
all
but
the
floor
between
the
hours
of
and
did
any
one
leave
or
enter
the
after
house
by
the
after
companion
yes
sir
singleton
went
down
into
the
and
came
back
again
in
five
or
ten
minutes
at
what
time
at
four
bells
two
no
one
else
no
sir
but
i
saw
turner
confine
yourself
to
the
question
what
was
singleton
manner
at
the
time
you
mention
he
was
excited
he
brought
up
a
bottle
of
whiskey
from
the
table
and
drank
what
was
left
in
it
then
he
muttered
something
and
threw
the
empty
bottle
over
the
rail
he
said
he
was
still
sick
the
confined
itself
to
one
detail
of
charlie
testimony
did
you
between
midnight
and
see
any
one
in
the
besides
the
mate
yes
mr
turner
you
say
you
can
not
see
into
the
from
the
wheel
at
night
how
did
you
see
him
he
turned
on
the
light
he
seemed
to
be
looking
for
something
was
he
dressed
yes
sir
can
you
describe
what
he
wore
yes
sir
his
coat
was
off
he
had
a
white
shirt
and
a
white
vest
were
the
shirt
and
vest
similar
to
these
i
show
you
most
of
them
things
look
alike
to
me
yes
sir
the
defense
had
scored
again
but
it
suffered
at
the
hands
of
burns
the
next
witness
i
believe
the
prosecution
had
intended
to
call
turner
at
this
time
but
after
a
whispered
conference
with
attorneys
they
made
a
change
turner
indeed
was
in
no
condition
to
go
on
the
stand
he
was
pallid
and
twitching
and
his
face
was
covered
with
sweat
burns
corroborated
the
testimony
against
singleton
his
surly
temper
his
outbursts
of
rage
his
threats
against
the
captain
and
he
brought
out
a
new
point
that
jones
the
helmsman
had
been
afraid
of
singleton
that
night
and
had
asked
not
to
be
left
alone
at
the
wheel
during
this
examination
the
prosecution
for
the
first
time
made
clear
their
position
that
the
captain
was
murdered
first
that
vail
interfered
and
pursued
by
singleton
took
refuge
in
his
bunk
where
he
was
slaughtered
that
the
murderer
bending
to
inspect
his
horrid
work
had
unwittingly
touched
the
bell
that
roused
karen
hansen
and
crouching
in
the
chartroom
with
the
axe
had
struck
her
as
she
opened
the
door
the
prosecution
questioned
burns
about
the
axe
and
its
disappearance
who
suggested
that
the
axe
be
kept
in
the
captain
cabin
leslie
acting
as
captain
who
had
the
key
i
carried
it
on
a
strong
line
around
my
neck
whose
arrangement
was
that
leslie
he
had
the
key
to
singleton
cabin
and
i
carried
this
one
we
divided
the
responsibility
did
you
ever
give
the
key
to
any
one
no
sir
did
it
ever
leave
you
not
until
it
was
taken
away
when
was
that
on
saturday
morning
august
shortly
before
dawn
tell
what
happened
i
was
knocked
down
from
behind
while
i
was
standing
at
the
port
forward
corner
of
the
after
house
the
key
was
taken
from
me
while
i
was
unconscious
did
you
ever
see
the
white
object
that
has
been
spoken
of
by
the
crew
no
sir
i
searched
the
deck
one
night
when
adams
the
lookout
raised
an
alarm
we
found
nothing
except
go
on
he
threw
down
a
marlinespike
at
something
moving
in
the
bow
the
spike
disappeared
we
could
find
it
although
we
could
see
where
it
had
struck
the
deck
afterwards
we
found
a
marlinespike
hanging
over
the
ship
side
by
a
lanyard
it
might
have
been
the
one
we
looked
for
explain
a
cord
a
sort
of
rope
it
could
not
have
fallen
over
the
side
and
hung
there
it
was
fastened
with
a
blackwell
hitch
show
us
what
you
mean
on
by
singleton
attorney
burns
was
forced
to
relate
the
incident
of
the
night
before
his
injury
that
johns
had
asked
to
see
the
axe
and
he
had
shown
it
to
her
he
maintained
stoutly
that
she
had
not
been
near
the
bunk
and
that
the
axe
was
there
when
he
locked
the
door
adams
called
testified
to
seeing
a
curious
object
on
the
it
had
seemed
to
come
over
the
bow
the
marlinespike
he
threw
had
had
no
lanyard
turner
and
miss
lee
escaped
with
a
light
examination
their
evidence
amounted
to
little
and
was
practically
the
same
they
had
retired
early
and
did
not
rouse
until
i
called
them
they
remained
in
their
rooms
most
of
the
time
after
that
and
were
busy
caring
for
turner
who
had
been
turner
was
good
enough
to
say
that
i
had
made
them
as
safe
and
as
comfortable
as
possible
the
number
of
witnesses
to
be
examined
and
the
searching
grilling
to
which
most
of
them
were
subjected
would
have
dragged
the
case
to
interminable
length
had
it
not
been
for
the
attitude
of
the
judges
who
discouraged
quibbling
and
showed
a
desire
to
reach
the
truth
with
the
least
possible
delay
one
of
the
judges
showed
the
wide
and
unbiased
attitude
of
the
court
by
a
little
speech
after
an
especially
venomous
contest
gentlemen
he
said
we
are
attempting
to
get
to
a
solution
of
this
thing
we
are
trying
one
man
it
is
true
but
in
a
certain
sense
we
are
trying
every
member
of
the
crew
every
person
who
was
on
board
the
ship
the
night
of
the
crime
we
have
a
curious
situation
the
murderer
is
before
us
either
in
the
prisoner
dock
or
among
the
witnesses
let
us
get
at
the
truth
without
bickering
johns
was
called
following
miss
lee
i
watched
her
carefully
on
the
stand
i
had
never
fathomed
johns
or
her
attitude
toward
the
rest
of
the
party
i
had
thought
at
the
beginning
of
the
cruise
that
vail
and
she
were
incipient
lovers
but
she
had
taken
his
death
with
a
calmness
that
was
close
to
indifference
there
was
something
strange
and
inexplicable
in
her
tigerish
championship
of
turner
and
it
remains
inexplicable
even
now
i
have
wondered
since
was
she
in
love
with
turner
or
was
she
only
a
fiery
partisan
i
wonder
she
testified
with
an
insolent
coolness
that
clearly
irritated
the
prosecution
thinking
over
her
replies
refusing
to
recall
certain
things
and
eyeing
the
jury
with
long
slanting
glances
that
set
them
according
to
their
type
either
wriggling
or
ogling
the
first
questions
were
the
usual
ones
then
do
you
recall
the
night
of
the
of
july
can
you
be
more
specific
i
refer
to
the
night
when
captain
richardson
found
the
prisoner
in
the
and
ordered
him
on
deck
i
recall
that
yes
where
were
you
during
the
quarrel
i
was
behind
mr
vail
tell
us
about
it
please
it
was
an
ordinary
brawl
the
captain
knocked
the
mate
down
did
you
hear
the
mate
threaten
the
captain
no
he
went
on
deck
muttering
i
did
not
hear
what
was
said
after
the
crimes
what
did
you
do
we
established
a
at
the
foot
of
the
forward
companion
the
other
was
locked
was
there
a
guard
at
the
top
of
the
companion
yes
but
we
trusted
no
one
where
was
mr
turner
ill
in
his
cabin
how
ill
very
he
was
delirious
did
you
allow
any
one
down
at
first
leslie
a
sort
of
and
deck
steward
who
seemed
to
know
something
of
medicine
afterward
we
would
not
allow
him
either
why
we
did
not
trust
him
this
leslie
why
had
you
asked
him
to
sleep
in
the
storeroom
i
was
afraid
will
you
explain
why
you
were
afraid
fear
is
difficult
to
explain
is
it
if
one
knows
why
one
is
afraid
one
er
generally
is
that
a
bit
subtle
i
afraid
you
were
afraid
then
without
knowing
why
yes
had
you
a
revolver
on
board
yes
whose
revolver
was
kept
on
the
cabin
table
mine
i
always
carry
one
always
yes
then
have
you
one
with
you
now
yes
when
you
asked
the
sailor
burns
to
let
you
see
the
axe
what
did
you
give
as
a
reason
the
truth
curiosity
then
having
seen
the
axe
where
did
you
go
below
please
explain
the
incident
of
the
two
articles
goldstein
showed
to
the
jury
yesterday
the
shirt
and
waistcoat
that
was
very
simple
turner
had
been
very
we
took
turns
in
caring
for
him
i
spilled
a
bowl
of
broth
over
the
garments
that
were
shown
and
rubbed
them
out
in
the
bathroom
they
were
hung
in
the
cabin
used
by
vail
to
dry
and
i
forgot
them
when
we
were
packing
the
attorney
for
the
defense
her
what
color
were
the
stains
you
speak
of
darkish
what
sort
of
broth
did
you
spill
that
childish
is
it
i
do
recall
you
recall
its
color
it
was
beef
broth
johns
on
the
night
you
visited
the
forward
house
and
viewed
the
axe
did
you
visit
it
again
the
axe
or
the
forward
house
the
house
she
made
one
of
her
long
pauses
finally
yes
when
between
three
and
four
who
went
with
you
i
went
alone
why
did
you
go
beyond
the
line
that
was
railed
off
for
your
safety
sharply
because
i
wished
to
i
was
able
to
take
care
of
myself
why
did
you
visit
the
forward
house
i
was
nervous
and
could
not
sleep
i
thought
no
one
safe
while
the
axe
was
on
the
ship
did
you
see
the
body
of
burns
the
sailor
lying
on
the
deck
at
that
time
he
might
have
been
there
i
did
not
see
him
are
you
saying
that
you
went
to
the
forward
house
to
throw
the
axe
overboard
yes
if
i
could
get
in
did
you
know
why
the
axe
was
being
kept
because
the
murders
had
been
committed
with
it
had
you
heard
of
any
on
the
handle
no
did
it
occur
to
you
that
you
were
interfering
with
justice
in
disposing
of
the
axe
do
you
mean
justice
or
law
they
are
not
the
same
tell
us
about
your
visit
to
the
forward
house
it
was
between
two
and
three
i
met
no
one
i
had
a
bunch
of
keys
from
the
trunks
and
from
four
doors
in
the
after
house
miss
lee
knew
i
intended
to
try
to
get
rid
of
the
axe
i
did
not
need
my
keys
the
door
was
open
open
i
i
went
in
and
here
for
the
first
time
johns
composure
forsook
her
she
turned
white
and
her
maid
passed
up
to
her
a
silver
bottle
what
happened
when
you
went
in
it
was
dark
i
stood
just
inside
then
something
rushed
past
me
and
out
of
the
door
a
something
i
do
know
what
a
woman
i
thought
at
first
in
white
if
the
room
was
dark
how
could
you
tell
it
was
white
there
was
a
faint
light
enough
to
see
that
there
was
no
noise
just
a
sort
of
swishing
sound
what
did
you
do
then
i
waited
a
moment
and
hurried
back
to
the
after
house
was
the
axe
gone
then
i
do
not
know
did
you
see
the
axe
at
that
time
no
did
you
touch
it
i
have
never
touched
it
at
that
time
or
before
she
could
not
be
shaken
in
her
testimony
and
was
excused
she
had
borne
her
grilling
exceedingly
well
and
in
spite
of
her
flippancy
there
was
a
ring
of
sincerity
about
the
testimony
that
gave
it
weight
following
her
evidence
the
testimony
of
tom
the
cook
made
things
look
bad
for
singleton
by
connecting
him
with
johns
intruder
in
the
captain
room
he
told
of
singleton
offer
to
make
him
a
key
to
the
galley
with
wire
it
was
clear
that
singleton
had
been
a
prisoner
in
name
only
and
this
damaging
statement
was
given
weight
when
on
my
recall
later
i
identified
the
bunch
of
keys
the
file
and
the
club
that
i
had
taken
from
singleton
mattress
it
was
plain
enough
that
with
singleton
able
to
free
himself
as
he
wished
the
attack
on
burns
and
the
disappearance
of
the
axe
were
easily
enough
accounted
for
it
would
have
been
possible
also
to
account
for
the
white
figure
that
had
so
alarmed
the
men
on
the
same
hypothesis
of
tom
by
goldstein
singleton
attorney
brought
out
one
curious
fact
he
had
made
no
dark
soup
or
broth
for
the
after
house
turner
had
taken
nothing
during
his
illness
but
clam
bouillon
made
with
milk
and
the
meals
served
to
the
four
women
had
been
very
light
they
lived
on
toast
and
tea
mostly
he
said
that
completed
the
taking
of
evidence
for
the
day
in
spite
of
the
struggles
of
the
clever
young
jew
the
weight
of
testimony
was
against
singleton
but
there
were
curious
discrepancies
turner
went
on

stand

next
morning

violent
opposition
developing
to
this
question
it
was
changed
in
form
and
broken
up
eventually
turner
answered
that
the
partitions
were
heavy
and
he
thought
it
possible
were
the
connecting

between
your

you
hear

in
a
sort
of
stupor

you
employed
him
on
the

had
been
in
our

times

such
threat

you
recall
what
you
said
i
was
indignant
think
again
turner
if
you
can
not
recall
some
one
else
will
i
threatened
to
dismiss
him
and
put
the
first
mate
in
his
place
i
was
angry
naturally
and
what
did
the
captain
reply
he
made
an
absurd
threat
to
put
me
in
irons
what
were
your
relations
after
that
they
were
strained
we
simply
avoided
each
other
just
a
few
more
questions
turner
and
i
shall
not
detain
you
do
you
carry
a
key
to
the
emergency
case
in
the
forward
house
the
case
that
contained
the
axe
like
many
of
the
questions
this
was
disputed
hotly
it
was
finally
allowed
and
turner
admitted
the
key
similar
cases
were
carried
on
all
the
turner
boats
and
he
had
such
a
key
on
his
ring
did
you
ever
see
the
white
object
that
terrified
the
crew
never
sailors
are
particularly
liable
to
such
hysteria
during
your
delirium
did
you
ever
see
such
a
figure
i
do
not
recall
any
details
of
that
part
of
my
illness
were
you
in
favor
of
bringing
the
bodies
back
to
port
i
yes
certainly
do
you
recall
going
on
deck
the
morning
after
the
murders
were
discovered
vaguely
what
were
the
men
doing
at
that
time
i
believe
really
i
do
not
like
to
repeat
so
often
that
i
was
ill
that
day
have
you
any
recollection
of
what
you
said
to
the
men
at
that
time
none
let
me
refresh
your
memory
from
the
ship
log
reading
turner
insisted
that
the
bodies
be
buried
at
sea
and
on
the
crew
opposing
this
retired
to
his
cabin
announcing
that
he
considered
the
attitude
of
the
men
a
mutiny
i
recall
being
angry
at
the
men
not
much
else
my
position
was
rational
enough
however
it
was
midsummer
and
we
had
a
long
voyage
before
us
i
wish
to
read
something
else
to
you
the
witness
leslie
testified
to
sleeping
in
the
storeroom
at
the
request
of
johns
reading
as
her
reason
a
fear
of
something
going
wrong
as
there
was
trouble
between
turner
and
the
captain
whatever
question
goldstein
had
been
framing
he
was
not
permitted
to
use
this
part
of
the
record
the
log
was
admissible
only
as
a
record
on
the
spot
made
by
a
competent
person
and
witnessed
by
all
concerned
of
the
actual
occurrences
on
the
ella
my
record
of
johns
remark
was
ruled
out
turner
was
not
on
trial
turner
pale
and
shaking
left
the
stand
at
two
that
day
and
i
was
recalled
my
earlier
testimony
had
merely
established
the
finding
of
the
bodies
i
was
now
to
have
a
bad
two
hours
i
was
an
important
witness
probably
the
most
important
i
had
heard
the
scream
that
had
revealed
the
tragedy
and
had
been
in
the
main
cabin
of
the
after
house
only
a
moment
or
so
after
the
murderer
i
had
found
the
bodies
vail
still
living
and
had
been
with
the
accused
mate
when
he
saw
the
captain
prostrate
at
the
foot
of
the
forward
companion
all
of
this
aided
by
skillful
questions
i
told
as
exactly
as
possible
i
told
of
the
mate
strange
manner
on
finding
the
bodies
i
related
to
a
breathless
quiet
the
placing
of
the
bodies
in
the
and
the
reading
of
the
burial
service
over
them
i
told
of
the
little
boat
that
followed
us
like
some
avenging
spirit
carrying
by
day
a
small
american
flag
union
down
and
at
night
a
white
light
i
told
of
having
to
increase
the
length
of
the
as
the
heat
grew
greater
and
of
a
fear
i
had
that
the
rope
would
separate
or
that
the
mysterious
hand
that
was
the
author
of
the
misfortunes
would
cut
the
line
i
told
of
the
long
nights
without
sleep
while
with
our
few
available
men
we
tried
to
work
the
ella
back
to
land
of
guarding
the
after
house
of
a
hundred
false
alarms
that
set
our
nerves
quivering
and
our
hearts
leaping
and
i
made
them
feel
i
think
the
horror
of
a
situation
where
each
man
suspected
his
neighbor
feared
and
loathed
him
and
yet
stayed
close
by
him
because
a
known
danger
is
better
than
an
unknown
horror
the
record
of
my
examination
is
particularly
faulty
mcwhirter
having
allowed
personal
feeling
to
interfere
with
accuracy
here
and
there
in
the
margins
of
his
notebook
i
find
unflattering
allusions
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
after
one
question
an
impeachment
of
my
motives
to
which
mac
took
violent
exception
no
answer
at
all
is
recorded
and
in
a
furious
scrawl
is
written
the
little
whippersnapper
leslie
could
smash
him
between
his
thumb
and
finger
i
found
another
curious
record
a
leaf
torn
out
of
the
book
and
evidently
designed
to
be
sent
to
me
but
failing
its
destination
was
as
follows
for
heaven
sake
do
look
at
the
girl
so
much
the
newspaper
men
are
on
but
to
resume
my
examination
the
first
questions
were
not
of
particular
interest
then
did
the
prisoner
know
you
had
moved
to
the
after
house
i
do
not
know
the
forecastle
hands
knew
tell
what
you
know
of
the
quarrel
on
july
between
captain
richardson
and
the
prisoner
i
saw
it
from
a
deck
window
i
described
it
in
detail
why
did
you
move
to
the
after
house
at
the
request
of
johns
she
said
she
was
nervous
what
reason
did
she
give
that
turner
was
in
a
dangerous
mood
he
had
quarreled
with
the
captain
and
was
quarreling
with
mr
vail
did
you
know
the
arrangement
of
rooms
in
the
after
house
how
the
people
slept
in
a
general
way
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
knew
vail
room
and
miss
lee
did
you
know
where
the
maids
slept
yes
you
have
testified
that
you
were
locked
in
was
the
key
kept
in
the
lock
yes
would
whoever
locked
you
in
have
had
only
to
move
the
key
from
one
side
of
the
door
to
the
other
yes
was
the
key
left
in
the
lock
when
you
were
fastened
in
no
now
leslie
we
want
you
to
tell
us
what
the
prisoner
did
that
night
when
you
told
him
what
had
happened
i
called
to
him
to
come
below
for
god
sake
he
seemed
dazed
and
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
i
told
him
to
get
his
revolver
and
call
the
captain
he
went
into
the
forward
house
and
got
his
revolver
but
he
did
not
call
the
captain
we
went
below
and
stumbled
over
the
captain
body
what
was
the
mate
condition
when
we
found
the
body
his
general
condition
he
was
intoxicated
he
collapsed
on
the
steps
when
we
found
the
captain
we
both
almost
collapsed
what
was
his
mental
condition
if
you
mean
was
he
frightened
we
both
were
was
he
pale
i
did
not
notice
then
he
was
pale
and
looked
ill
later
when
the
crew
had
gathered
about
this
key
was
it
ever
found
the
key
to
the
storeroom
yes
when
that
same
morning
where
and
by
whom
miss
lee
found
it
on
the
floor
in
turner
room
the
prosecution
was
totally
unprepared
for
this
reply
and
proceedings
were
delayed
for
a
moment
while
the
attorneys
consulted
on
the
resumption
of
my
examination
they
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
impeach
my
character
as
a
witness
trying
to
show
that
i
had
sailed
under
false
pretenses
that
i
was
so
feared
in
the
after
house
that
the
women
refused
to
allow
me
below
or
to
administer
to
turner
the
remedies
i
prepared
and
finally
that
i
had
surrendered
myself
to
the
crew
as
a
suspect
of
my
own
accord
against
this
the
threw
all
its
weight
the
prosecuting
attorneys
having
dropped
the
question
of
the
key
the
shrewd
young
lawyer
for
the
defense
followed
it
up
this
key
leslie
do
you
know
where
it
is
now
yes
i
have
it
will
you
tell
how
it
came
into
your
possession
certainly
i
picked
it
up
on
the
deck
a
night
or
so
after
the
murders
miss
lee
had
dropped
it
i
caught
elsa
lee
eye
and
she
gave
me
a
warm
glance
of
gratitude
have
you
the
key
with
you
yes
i
produced
it
are
you
a
football
player
doctor
i
was
i
thought
i
recalled
you
i
have
seen
you
play
several
times
in
spite
of
our
friend
the
attorney
for
the
commonwealth
i
do
not
believe
we
will
need
to
call
character
witnesses
for
you
did
you
see
miss
lee
pick
up
the
key
to
the
storeroom
in
turner
room
yes
did
it
occur
to
you
at
the
time
that
the
key
had
any
significance
i
wondered
how
it
got
there
you
say
you
listened
inside
the
locked
door
and
heard
no
sound
but
felt
a
board
rise
up
under
your
knee
a
moment
or
two
later
when
you
called
the
prisoner
he
was
intoxicated
and
reeled
do
you
mean
to
tell
us
that
a
drunken
man
could
have
made
his
way
in
the
darkness
through
a
cabin
filled
with
chairs
tables
and
a
piano
in
absolute
silence
the
prosecuting
attorney
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
and
the
objection
was
sustained
i
was
next
shown
the
keys
club
and
file
taken
from
singleton
mattress
you
have
identified
these
objects
as
having
been
found
concealed
in
the
prisoner
mattress
do
any
of
these
keys
fit
the
captain
cabin
no
who
saw
the
prisoner
during
the
days
he
was
locked
in
his
cabin
i
saw
him
occasionally
the
cook
saw
him
when
he
carried
him
his
meals
did
you
ever
tell
the
prisoner
where
the
axe
was
kept
no
did
the
members
of
the
crew
know
i
believe
so
yes
was
the
fact
that
burns
carried
the
key
to
the
captain
cabin
a
matter
of
general
knowledge
no
the
crew
knew
that
burns
and
i
carried
the
keys
they
did
not
know
which
one
each
carried
unless
go
on
please
if
any
one
had
seen
burns
take
johns
forward
and
show
her
the
axe
he
would
have
known
who
were
on
deck
at
that
time
all
the
crew
were
on
deck
the
forecastle
being
closed
in
the
was
mcnamara
jones
was
at
the
wheel
from
the
could
the
lookout
have
seen
burns
and
johns
going
forward
no
the
two
houses
were
connected
by
an
awning
what
could
the
helmsman
see
nothing
forward
of
the
after
house
the
prosecution
closed
its
case
with
me
the
defense
having
virtually
conducted
its
case
by
of
the
witnesses
already
called
contented
itself
with
producing
a
few
character
witnesses
and
rested
goldstein
made
an
eloquent
plea
of
no
case
and
asked
the
judge
so
to
instruct
the
jury
this
was
refused
and
the
case
went
to
the
jury
on
the
seventh
day
a
surprisingly
short
trial
considering
the
magnitude
of
the
crimes
the
jury
disagreed
but
while
they
wrangled
mcwhirter
and
i
were
already
on
the
right
track
at
the
very
hour
that
the
jurymen
were
being
discharged
and
steps
taken
for
a
retrial
we
had
the
murderer
locked
in
my
room
in
a
cheap
off
chestnut
street
chapter
xxiii
free
again
with
the
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury
the
witnesses
were
given
their
freedom
mcwhirter
had
taken
a
room
for
me
for
a
day
or
two
to
give
me
time
to
look
about
and
his
own
leave
of
absence
from
his
hospital
being
for
ten
days
we
had
some
time
together
my
situation
was
better
than
it
had
been
in
the
summer
i
had
my
strength
again
although
the
long
confinement
had
told
on
me
but
my
position
was
precarious
enough
i
had
my
pay
from
the
ella
and
nothing
else
and
mcwhirter
with
a
monthly
stipend
from
his
hospital
of
dollars
was
not
much
better
off
my
first
evening
of
freedom
we
spent
at
the
theater
we
bought
the
best
seats
in
the
house
and
we
dressed
for
the
occasion
being
in
the
position
of
having
nothing
to
wear
between
shabby
everyday
wear
and
evening
clothes
it
is
by
way
of
celebration
mac
said
as
he
put
a
dab
of
over
a
hole
in
his
sock
you
having
been
restored
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
that
the
game
leslie
the
pursuit
of
happiness
i
was
busy
with
a
dress
tie
that
i
had
washed
and
dried
by
pasting
it
on
a
mirror
an
old
trick
of
mine
when
funds
ran
low
i
was
trying
to
enter
into
mac
festive
humor
but
i
had
not
reacted
yet
from
the
horrors
of
the
past
few
months
happiness
i
said
scornfully
do
you
call
this
happiness
he
put
up
the
blacking
and
coming
to
me
stood
eyeing
me
in
the
mirror
as
i
arranged
my
necktie
do
be
bitter
he
said
happiness
was
my
word
the
good
man
was
good
to
you
when
he
made
you
that
ought
to
be
a
source
of
satisfaction
and
as
for
the
girl
what
girl
if
she
could
only
see
you
now
why
in
thunder
did
you
take
those
clothes
on
board
i
wanted
you
to
could
a
captain
wear
a
dress
suit
on
special
occasions
mac
i
said
gravely
if
you
will
think
a
moment
you
will
remember
that
the
only
special
occasions
on
the
ella
after
i
took
charge
were
funerals
have
you
sat
through
seven
days
of
horrors
without
realizing
that
mac
had
once
gone
to
europe
on
a
liner
and
having
exhausted
his
funds
returned
on
a
all
the
captains
i
ever
knew
he
said
largely
were
a
fussy
lot
dressed
to
kill
and
navigating
the
boat
from
the
head
of
a
but
i
suppose
you
know
i
was
only
regretting
that
she
had
seen
you
the
way
you
looking
now
that
all
i
suppose
i
may
regret
without
hurting
your
feelings
he
dropped
all
mention
of
elsa
after
that
for
a
long
time
but
i
saw
him
looking
at
me
at
intervals
during
the
evening
and
sighing
he
was
still
regretting
we
enjoyed
the
theater
after
all
with
the
enthusiasm
of
long
months
of
work
and
strain
we
laughed
at
the
puerile
fun
encored
the
prettiest
of
the
girls
and
swaggered
in
the
lobby
between
acts
with
cigarettes
there
we
ran
across
the
one
man
i
knew
in
philadelphia
and
had
supper
after
the
play
with
three
or
four
fellows
who
on
hearing
my
story
persisted
in
believing
that
i
had
sailed
on
the
ella
as
a
lark
or
to
follow
a
girl
my
simple
statement
that
i
had
done
it
out
of
necessity
met
with
roars
of
laughter
and
finally
i
let
it
go
at
that
it
was
after
one
when
we
got
back
to
the
being
escorted
there
in
a
racing
car
by
a
riotous
crowd
that
stood
outside
the
door
as
i
fumbled
for
my
key
and
screeched
in
unison
leslie
leslie
leslie
sic
before
they
drove
away
the
light
in
the
dingy
parlor
was
burning
full
but
the
hall
was
dark
i
stopped
inside
and
lighted
a
cigarette
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
mac
i
said
i
got
the
first
two
and
the
other
can
be
had
for
the
pursuit
mac
did
not
reply
he
was
staring
into
the
parlor
elsa
lee
was
standing
by
a
table
looking
at
me
she
was
very
nervous
and
tried
to
explain
her
presence
in
a
breath
with
the
result
that
she
broke
down
utterly
and
had
to
stop
mac
his
jovial
face
rather
startled
was
making
for
the
stairs
but
i
sternly
brought
him
back
and
presented
him
whereon
being
utterly
confounded
he
made
the
tactful
remark
that
he
would
have
to
go
and
put
out
the
it
was
almost
morning
she
had
been
waiting
since
ten
she
said
a
taxicab
with
her
maid
was
at
the
door
they
were
going
back
to
new
york
in
the
morning
and
things
were
terribly
wrong
wrong
you
need
not
mind
mcwhirter
he
is
as
anxious
as
i
am
to
be
helpful
there
are
detectives
watching
marshall
we
saw
one
at
the
hotel
if
the
jury
disagrees
and
the
lawyers
think
they
will
they
will
arrest
him
i
thought
it
probable
there
was
nothing
i
could
say
mcwhirter
made
an
effort
to
reassure
her
it
would
be
a
hanging
matter
anyhow
he
said
there
a
lot
against
him
but
hardly
a
jury
in
the
country
would
hang
a
man
for
something
he
did
if
he
could
prove
he
was
delirious
the
next
day
she
paled
at
this
dubious
comfort
but
it
struck
her
sense
of
humor
too
for
she
threw
me
a
fleeting
smile
i
was
to
ask
you
to
do
something
she
said
none
of
us
can
for
we
are
being
watched
i
was
probably
followed
here
the
ella
is
still
in
the
river
with
only
a
watchman
on
board
we
want
you
to
go
there
if
you
can
to
the
ella
she
was
feeling
in
her
pocketbook
and
now
she
held
out
to
me
an
envelope
addressed
in
a
sprawling
hand
to
turner
at
his
hotel
am
i
to
open
it
please
i
unfolded
a
sheet
of
ruled
of
the
most
ordinary
variety
it
had
been
opened
and
laid
flat
and
on
it
in
black
ink
was
a
crude
drawing
of
the
deck
of
the
ella
as
one
would
look
down
on
it
from
aloft
here
and
there
were
small
crosses
in
red
ink
and
overlying
it
all
from
bow
to
stern
a
red
axe
around
the
border
not
written
but
printed
in
childish
letters
were
the
words
not
yet
ha
ha
in
a
corner
was
a
drawing
of
a
gallows
or
what
passes
in
the
everyday
mind
for
a
gallows
and
in
the
opposite
corner
an
open
book
you
see
she
said
it
was
mailed
downtown
late
this
afternoon
the
hotel
got
it
at
seven
marshall
wanted
to
get
a
detective
but
i
thought
of
you
i
knew
you
knew
the
boat
and
then
you
had
said
anything
in
all
the
world
that
i
can
do
to
help
you
i
will
do
i
said
looking
at
her
and
the
thing
that
i
could
not
keep
out
of
my
eyes
made
her
drop
hers
sweet
little
document
said
mcwhirter
looking
over
my
shoulder
sent
by
some
one
with
a
nice
disposition
what
do
the
crosses
mark
the
location
of
the
bodies
when
found
i
explained
these
three
this
looks
like
the
place
where
burns
lay
unconscious
that
one
near
the
rail
i
do
know
about
nor
this
by
the
mainmast
we
thought
they
might
mark
places
clues
perhaps
that
had
been
overlooked
the
whole
the
whole
document
is
a
taunt
is
it
the
scaffold
and
the
axe
and
yet
a
piece
of
bravado
right
you
are
said
mcwhirter
admiringly
a
little
escape
of
glee
from
somebody
who
laughing
too
soon
it
will
soon
be
the
proper
hour
for
something
to
happen
on
the
ella
wo
it
if
that
was
sent
by
some
member
of
the
crew
and
it
looks
like
it
they
are
loose
the
quicker
we
follow
it
up
the
better
if
there
anything
to
follow
we
thought
if
you
would
go
early
in
the
morning
before
any
of
them
make
an
excuse
to
go
back
on
board
we
will
go
right
away
but
please
do
build
too
much
on
this
a
good
possibility
that
all
will
the
watchman
let
us
on
board
we
thought
of
that
here
is
a
note
to
him
from
marshall
and
will
you
do
us
one
more
kindness
i
will
then
if
you
should
find
anything
bring
it
to
us
to
the
police
later
if
you
must
but
to
us
first
when
in
the
morning
we
will
not
leave
until
we
hear
from
you
she
held
out
her
hand
first
to
mcwhirter
then
to
me
i
kept
it
a
little
longer
than
i
should
have
perhaps
and
she
did
not
take
it
away
it
is
such
a
comfort
she
said
to
have
you
with
us
and
not
against
us
for
marshall
did
do
it
leslie
i
mean
it
is
hard
for
me
to
think
of
you
as
leslie
he
did
do
it
at
first
we
thought
he
might
have
and
he
was
delirious
and
could
not
reassure
us
he
swears
he
did
not
i
think
just
at
first
he
was
afraid
he
had
done
it
but
he
did
not
i
believe
that
and
you
must
i
believed
her
i
believed
anything
she
said
i
think
that
if
she
had
chosen
to
say
that
i
had
wielded
the
murderer
axe
on
the
ella
i
should
have
gone
to
the
gallows
rather
than
gainsay
her
from
that
night
i
was
the
devil
advocate
if
you
like
i
was
determined
to
save
marshall
turner
she
wished
us
to
take
her
taxicab
dropping
her
at
her
hotel
and
reckless
now
of
everything
but
being
with
her
i
would
have
done
so
but
mcwhirter
discreet
cough
reminded
me
of
the
level
of
our
finances
and
i
made
the
excuse
of
putting
on
more
suitable
clothing
i
stood
in
the
street
bareheaded
watching
her
taxicab
as
it
rattled
down
the
street
mcwhirter
touched
me
on
the
arm
wake
up
he
said
we
have
work
to
do
my
friend
we
went
upstairs
together
cautiously
not
to
rouse
the
house
at
the
top
mac
turned
and
patted
me
on
the
elbow
my
shoulder
being
a
foot
or
so
above
him
good
boy
he
said
and
if
that
shirtfront
and
tie
did
knock
into
eternal
oblivion
the
on
the
ella
i
eat
them
chapter
xxiv
the
thing
i
deserve
no
credit
for
the
solution
of
the
ella
mystery
i
have
a
certain
quality
of
force
perhaps
and
i
am
not
lacking
in
physical
courage
but
i
have
no
finesse
of
intellect
mcwhirter
a
foot
shorter
than
i
round
of
face
jovial
and
stocky
has
as
much
subtlety
in
his
little
finger
as
i
have
in
my
six
feet
and
a
fraction
of
body
all
the
way
to
the
river
therefore
he
was
poring
over
the
drawing
he
named
the
paper
at
once
ought
to
know
it
he
said
in
reply
to
my
surprise
sold
enough
paper
at
the
drugstore
to
qualify
as
a
stationery
engineer
he
writhed
as
was
his
habit
over
his
jokes
and
then
fell
to
work
at
the
drawing
again
a
book
he
said
and
an
axe
and
a
gibbet
or
gallows
that
makes
does
go
far
does
it
humorous
duck
is
he
any
one
who
can
write
ha
under
a
gallows
has
real
humor
the
ella
still
lay
in
the
delaware
half
a
mile
or
so
from
her
original
moorings
she
carried
the
usual
a
white
one
in
the
bow
another
at
the
stern
and
the
two
vertical
red
lights
which
showed
her
not
under
command
in
reply
to
repeated
signals
we
were
unable
to
rouse
the
watchman
i
had
brought
an
electric
flash
with
me
and
by
its
aid
we
found
a
rope
ladder
over
the
side
with
a
small
boat
at
its
foot
although
the
boat
indicated
the
presence
of
the
watchman
on
board
we
made
our
way
to
the
deck
without
challenge
here
mcwhirter
suggested
that
the
situation
might
be
disagreeable
were
the
man
to
waken
and
get
at
us
with
a
gun
we
stood
by
the
top
of
the
ladder
therefore
and
made
another
effort
to
rouse
him
hey
watchman
i
called
and
mcwhirter
in
a
deep
bass
sang
lustily
watchman
what
of
the
night
neither
of
us
made
any
perceptible
impression
on
the
silence
and
gloom
of
the
ella
mcwhirter
grew
less
gay
the
deserted
decks
of
the
ship
her
tragic
history
her
isolation
the
darkness
which
my
small
flash
seemed
only
to
intensify
all
had
their
effect
on
him
it
got
my
goat
he
admitted
it
smells
like
a
tomb
do
be
an
ass
turn
the
light
over
the
side
and
see
if
we
fastened
that
boat
we
do
want
to
be
left
here
indefinitely
that
folly
mac
i
said
but
i
obeyed
him
the
watchman
boat
is
there
so
we
but
he
caught
me
suddenly
by
the
arm
and
shook
me
my
god
he
said
what
is
that
over
there
it
was
a
moment
before
my
eyes
after
the
flashlight
could
discern
anything
in
the
darkness
mac
was
pointing
forward
when
i
could
see
mac
was
ready
to
laugh
at
himself
i
told
you
the
place
had
my
goat
he
said
sheepishly
i
thought
i
saw
something
duck
around
the
corner
of
that
building
but
i
think
it
was
a
ray
from
a
searchlight
on
one
of
those
boats
the
watchman
probably
i
said
quietly
but
my
heart
beat
a
little
faster
the
watchman
taking
a
look
at
us
and
gone
for
his
gun
i
thought
rapidly
if
mac
had
seen
anything
i
did
not
believe
it
was
the
watchman
but
there
should
be
a
watchman
on
board
in
the
forward
house
probably
i
gave
mac
my
revolver
and
put
the
light
in
my
pocket
i
might
want
both
hands
that
night
i
saw
better
without
the
flash
and
guided
partly
by
the
bow
light
partly
by
my
knowledge
of
the
yacht
i
led
the
way
across
the
deck
the
forward
house
was
closed
and
locked
and
no
knocking
produced
any
indication
of
life
the
after
house
we
found
not
only
locked
but
barred
across
with
strips
of
wood
nailed
into
place
the
forecastle
was
likewise
closed
it
was
a
dead
ship
no
figure
reappearing
to
alarm
him
mac
took
the
drawing
out
of
his
pocket
and
focused
the
flashlight
on
it
this
cross
by
the
mainmast
he
said
that
would
be
where
right
behind
you
there
he
walked
to
the
mast
and
examined
carefully
around
its
base
there
was
nothing
there
and
even
now
i
do
not
know
to
what
that
cross
alluded
unless
poor
schwartz
then
this
other
one
forward
you
call
it
do
you
suppose
we
locate
that
all
expectation
of
the
watchman
having
now
died
we
went
forward
on
the
port
side
to
the
approximate
location
of
the
cross
this
being
in
the
neighborhood
where
mac
had
thought
he
saw
something
move
we
approached
with
extreme
caution
but
nothing
more
ominous
was
discovered
than
the
port
lifeboat
nothing
more
ghostly
heard
than
the
occasional
creak
with
which
it
rocked
in
its
davits
the
lifeboat
seemed
to
be
indicated
by
the
cross
it
swung
almost
on
mcwhirter
we
looked
under
and
around
it
with
a
growing
feeling
that
we
had
misread
the
significance
of
the
crosses
or
that
the
sinister
record
extended
to
a
time
before
the
she
devil
of
the
turner
line
was
dressed
in
white
and
turned
into
a
lady
i
was
feeling
underneath
the
boat
with
a
sense
of
absurdity
that
mcwhirter
put
into
words
i
only
hope
he
said
that
the
watchman
does
not
wake
up
now
and
see
us
he
be
justified
in
filling
us
with
lead
or
putting
us
in
straitjackets
but
i
had
discovered
something
mac
i
said
some
one
has
been
at
this
boat
within
the
last
few
minutes
why
take
your
revolver
and
watch
the
deck
one
of
the
barecas
what
that
one
of
the
has
been
upset
and
the
plug
is
out
it
is
leaking
into
the
boat
it
is
leaking
fast
and
there
only
a
gallon
or
so
in
the
bottom
give
me
the
light
the
contents
of
the
boat
revealed
the
truth
of
what
i
had
said
the
boat
was
in
confusion
its
cover
had
been
thrown
back
and
tins
of
biscuit
bailers
boathooks
and
extra
rowlocks
were
jumbled
together
in
confusion
the
barecas
lay
on
its
side
and
its
plug
had
been
either
knocked
or
drawn
out
mcwhirter
was
for
turning
to
inspect
the
boat
but
i
ordered
him
sternly
to
watch
the
deck
he
was
inclined
to
laugh
at
my
caution
which
he
claimed
was
a
quality
in
me
he
had
not
suspected
he
lounged
against
the
rail
near
me
and
in
spite
of
his
chaff
kept
a
keen
enough
lookout
the
barecas
of
water
were
lashed
amidships
in
the
bow
and
stern
were
small
compartments
and
in
the
stern
was
also
a
small
locker
from
which
the
biscuit
tins
had
been
taken
i
was
about
to
abandon
my
search
when
i
saw
something
gleaming
in
the
locker
and
reached
in
and
drew
it
out
it
appeared
to
be
an
ordinary
white
sheet
but
its
presence
there
was
curious
i
turned
the
light
on
it
it
was
covered
with
stains
even
now
the
memory
of
that
sheet
turns
me
ill
i
shook
it
out
and
mac
at
my
exclamation
came
to
me
it
was
not
a
sheet
at
all
that
is
not
a
whole
one
it
was
a
circular
piece
of
white
cloth
on
which
in
black
were
curious
marks
a
star
predominating
there
were
others
a
crescent
a
crude
attempt
to
draw
what
might
be
either
a
dog
or
a
lamb
and
a
cross
from
edge
to
edge
it
was
smeared
with
blood
of
what
followed
just
after
both
mcwhirter
and
i
are
vague
there
seemed
to
be
simultaneously
a
yell
of
fury
from
the
rigging
overhead
and
the
crash
of
a
falling
body
on
the
deck
near
us
then
we
were
closing
with
a
kicking
biting
screaming
thing
that
bore
me
to
the
ground
extinguishing
the
little
electric
flash
and
that
rising
suddenly
from
under
me
had
mcwhirter
in
the
air
and
almost
overboard
before
i
caught
him
so
dazed
were
we
by
the
onslaught
that
the
thing
whatever
it
was
could
have
escaped
and
left
us
none
the
wiser
but
although
it
eluded
us
in
the
darkness
it
did
not
leave
it
was
there
whimpering
to
itself
searching
for
something
the
sheet
as
i
steadied
mac
it
passed
me
i
caught
at
it
immediately
the
struggle
began
all
over
again
but
this
time
we
had
the
advantage
and
kept
it
after
a
battle
that
seemed
to
last
all
night
and
that
was
actually
fought
all
over
that
part
of
the
deck
we
held
the
creature
subdued
and
mac
getting
a
hand
free
struck
a
match
it
was
charlie
jones
that
after
all
is
the
story
jones
was
a
madman
a
homicidal
maniac
of
the
worst
type
always
a
madman
the
homicidal
element
of
his
disease
was
recurrent
and
of
a
curious
nature
he
thought
himself
a
priest
of
heaven
appointed
to
make
ghastly
sacrifices
at
certain
signals
from
on
high
the
signals
i
am
not
sure
of
he
turned
taciturn
after
his
capture
and
would
not
talk
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
a
shooting
star
perhaps
in
a
particular
quarter
of
the
heavens
was
his
signal
this
is
distinctly
possible
and
is
made
probable
by
the
stars
which
he
had
painted
with
tar
on
his
sacrificial
robe
the
story
of
the
early
morning
of
august
will
never
be
fully
known
but
much
of
it
in
view
of
our
knowledge
we
were
able
to
reconstruct
thus
jones
ate
his
supper
that
night
a
mild
and
individual
during
the
afternoon
before
he
had
read
prayers
for
the
soul
of
schwartz
in
whose
departure
he
may
or
may
not
have
had
a
part
i
am
inclined
to
think
not
jones
construing
his
mission
as
being
one
to
remove
the
wicked
and
the
oppressor
and
schwartz
hardly
coming
under
either
classification
he
was
at
the
wheel
from
midnight
until
four
in
the
morning
on
the
night
of
the
murders
at
certain
hours
we
believe
that
he
went
forward
to
the
and
performed
clad
in
his
priestly
robe
such
devotions
as
his
disordered
mind
dictated
it
is
my
idea
that
he
looked
at
these
times
for
a
heavenly
signal
either
a
meteor
or
some
strange
appearance
of
the
heavens
it
was
known
that
he
was
a
poor
sleeper
and
spent
much
time
at
night
wandering
around
on
the
night
of
the
crimes
it
is
probable
that
he
performed
his
devotions
early
and
then
got
the
signal
this
is
evidenced
by
singleton
finding
the
axe
against
the
captain
door
before
midnight
he
had
evidently
been
disturbed
we
believe
that
he
intended
to
kill
the
captain
and
turner
but
made
a
mistake
in
the
rooms
he
clearly
intended
to
kill
the
danish
girl
several
passages
in
his
bible
marked
with
a
red
cross
showed
his
inflamed
hatred
of
loose
women
and
he
believed
karen
hansen
to
be
of
that
type
he
locked
me
in
slipping
down
from
the
wheel
to
do
so
and
pocketing
the
key
the
night
was
fairly
quiet
he
could
lash
the
wheel
safely
and
he
had
in
his
favor
the
fact
that
oleson
the
lookout
was
a
swede
who
notoriously
slept
on
his
watch
he
found
the
axe
not
where
he
had
left
it
but
back
in
the
case
but
the
case
was
only
closed
not
locked
singleton
error
armed
with
the
axe
jones
slipped
back
to
the
wheel
and
waited
he
had
plenty
of
time
he
had
taken
his
robe
from
its
in
the
boat
and
had
it
concealed
near
him
with
the
axe
he
was
ready
but
he
was
waiting
for
another
signal
he
got
it
at
two
he
admitted
the
signal
and
the
time
but
concealed
its
nature
i
think
it
was
a
shooting
star
he
killed
vail
first
believing
it
to
be
turner
and
making
with
his
axe
the
four
signs
of
the
cross
then
he
went
to
the
hansen
girl
door
he
did
not
know
about
the
bell
and
probably
rang
it
by
accident
as
he
leaned
over
to
listen
if
vail
still
breathed
the
captain
in
the
mean
time
had
been
watching
singleton
he
had
forbidden
his
entering
the
after
house
if
he
caught
him
disobeying
he
meant
to
put
him
in
irons
he
was
without
shoes
or
coat
and
he
sat
waiting
on
the
after
companion
steps
for
developments
it
was
the
captain
probably
whom
karen
hansen
mistook
for
turner
later
he
went
back
to
the
forward
companionway
either
on
his
way
back
to
his
cabin
or
still
with
an
eye
to
singleton
movements
to
the
captain
there
must
have
appeared
this
grisly
figure
in
flowing
white
smeared
with
blood
and
armed
with
an
axe
the
sheet
was
worn
over
jones
head
a
long
narrow
slit
serving
him
to
see
through
and
two
other
slits
freeing
his
arms
the
captain
was
a
brave
man
but
the
apparition
gleaming
in
the
almost
complete
darkness
had
been
on
him
before
he
could
do
more
than
throw
up
his
hands
jones
had
not
finished
he
went
back
to
the
and
possibly
even
went
on
deck
and
took
a
look
at
the
wheel
then
he
went
down
again
and
killed
the
hansen
woman
he
was
exceedingly
cunning
he
flung
the
axe
into
the
room
and
was
up
and
at
the
wheel
again
all
within
a
few
seconds
to
tear
off
and
fold
up
the
sheet
to
hide
it
under
cordage
to
strike
the
bell
and
light
his
pipe
all
this
was
a
matter
of
two
or
three
minutes
i
had
only
time
to
look
at
vail
when
i
got
up
to
the
wheel
jones
was
smoking
quietly
i
believe
he
tried
to
get
singleton
later
and
failed
but
he
continued
his
devotions
on
the
forward
deck
visible
when
clad
in
his
robe
invisible
when
he
took
it
off
it
was
jones
of
course
who
attacked
burns
and
secured
the
key
to
the
captain
cabin
jones
who
threw
the
axe
overboard
after
hearing
the
crew
tell
that
on
its
handle
were
to
identify
the
murderer
jones
who
while
on
guard
in
the
after
house
below
had
pushed
the
key
to
the
storeroom
under
turner
door
jones
who
hung
the
marlinespike
over
the
side
waiting
perhaps
for
another
chance
at
singleton
jones
in
his
devotional
attire
who
had
frightened
the
crew
into
hysteria
and
who
discovered
by
johns
in
the
captain
cabin
had
rushed
by
her
and
out
with
the
axe
it
is
noticeable
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
attack
her
he
killed
only
in
obedience
to
his
signal
and
he
had
had
no
signal
perhaps
the
most
curious
thing
after
the
murderer
was
known
was
the
story
of
the
people
in
the
after
house
it
was
months
before
i
got
that
in
full
the
belief
among
the
women
was
that
turner
maddened
by
drink
and
unreasoning
jealousy
had
killed
vail
and
then
running
amuck
or
discovered
by
the
other
victims
had
killed
them
this
was
borne
out
by
turner
condition
his
hands
and
parts
of
his
clothing
were
their
condition
was
pitiable
unable
to
speak
for
himself
he
lay
raving
in
his
room
talking
to
vail
and
complaining
of
a
white
figure
that
bothered
him
the
key
that
elsa
lee
picked
up
was
another
clue
and
in
their
attempt
to
get
rid
of
it
i
had
foiled
them
johns
an
old
friend
and
as
i
have
said
an
ardent
partisan
undertook
to
get
rid
of
the
axe
with
the
result
that
we
know
even
turner
recovery
brought
little
courage
he
could
only
recall
that
he
had
gone
into
vail
room
and
tried
to
wake
him
without
result
that
he
did
not
know
of
the
blood
until
the
next
day
or
that
vail
was
dead
and
that
he
had
a
vague
recollection
of
something
white
and
ghostly
that
night
he
was
not
sure
where
he
had
seen
it
the
failure
of
their
attempt
to
get
rid
of
the
storeroom
key
was
matched
by
their
failure
to
smuggle
turner
linen
off
the
ship
singleton
suspected
turner
and
with
the
skillful
and
not
over
scrupulous
aid
of
his
lawyer
had
succeeded
in
finding
in
trunk
the
incriminating
pieces
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
keys
file
and
club
in
singleton
mattress
i
believe
the
explanation
is
simple
enough
he
saw
against
him
a
strong
case
he
had
little
money
and
no
influence
while
turner
had
both
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
hoped
to
make
his
escape
before
the
ship
anchored
and
was
frustrated
by
my
discovery
of
the
keys
and
by
an
extra
bolt
i
put
on
his
door
and
window
the
murders
on
the
ella
were
solved
mcwhirter
went
back
to
his
hospital
the
day
after
our
struggle
wearing
a
strip
of
plaster
over
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
a
new
air
of
importance
the
turners
went
to
new
york
soon
after
and
i
was
alone
i
tried
to
put
elsa
lee
out
of
my
thoughts
as
she
had
gone
out
of
my
life
and
receiving
the
hospital
appointment
at
that
time
i
tried
to
make
up
by
hard
work
for
a
happiness
that
i
had
not
lost
because
it
had
never
been
mine
a
curious
thing
has
happened
to
me
i
had
thought
this
record
finished
but
perhaps
turner
health
is
bad
he
and
his
wife
and
miss
lee
are
going
to
europe
he
has
asked
me
to
go
with
him
in
my
professional
capacity
it
is
more
than
a
year
since
i
have
seen
her
the
year
has
brought
some
changes
singleton
is
again
a
member
of
the
turner
forces
having
signed
a
contract
and
a
temperance
pledge
at
the
same
sitting
jones
is
in
a
hospital
for
the
insane
where
in
the
daytime
he
is
a
cheery
old
tar
with
twinkling
eyes
and
a
huge
mustache
and
where
now
and
then
on
christmas
and
holidays
i
send
him
a
supply
of
tobacco
at
night
he
sleeps
in
a
room
with
opaque
glass
windows
through
which
no
heavenly
signals
can
penetrate
he
will
not
talk
of
his
crimes
not
that
he
so
regards
them
but
now
and
then
in
the
night
he
wraps
the
drapery
of
his
couch
about
him
and
performs
strange
orisons
in
the
little
room
that
is
his
and
at
such
times
an
attendant
watches
outside
his
door

a

in

from

as
if
she
loved
it
her
crisp
skirts
flying
her
hair
blown
back
from
her
forehead
in
damp
curls
and
i
am
not
washing
down
the
deck
with
all
the
poise
of
white
flannels
and
a
good
cigar
i
am
lounging
in
a
watching
her
then
come
here
i
say
i
am
busy
you
are
not
busy
you
are
disgracefully
idle
why
do
you
want
me
she
comes
closer
and
looks
down
at
me
she
likes
me
to
sit
so
she
may
look
superior
and
scornful
this
being
impossible
when
one
looks
up
when
she
has
approached
just
to
show
that
i
can
order
you
about
i
shall
go
back
with
raised
chin
how
i
remember
that
raised
chin
and
how
whisper
it
i
used
to
fear
it
you
can
not
i
am
holding
the
edge
of
your
skirt
ralph
and
all
the
other
passengers
looking
then
sit
down
and
before
you
do
tuck
that
rug
under
my
feet
will
you
certainly
not
under
my
feet
she
does
it
under
protest
whereon
i
release
her
skirts
she
is
sulky
quite
distinctly
sulky
i
slide
my
hand
under
the
rug
into
her
lap
she
ignores
it
now
i
say
calmly
we
are
even
and
you
might
as
well
hold
my
hand
every
one
thinks
you
are
she
brings
her
hands
hastily
from
under
her
rug
and
puts
them
over
her
head
i
do
know
what
has
got
into
you
she
says
coldly
and
why
are
we
even
for
the
day
you
told
me
the
deck
was
not
clean
it
was
clean
i
think
i
am
going
to
kiss
you
ralph
it
is
coming
on
about
the
time
that
the
bishop
gets
here
i
shall
lean
over
and
she
eyes
me
and
sees
determination
in
my
face
she
changes
color
you
would
would
i
she
rises
hastily
and
stands
looking
down
at
me
i
am
quite
sure
at
that
moment
that
she
detests
me
and
i
rather
like
it
there
are
always
times
when
we
detest
the
people
we
love
if
you
are
going
to
be
arbitrary
just
because
you
can
yes
marsh
and
the
rest
are
in
the
smoking
room
their
is
empty
quite
calmly
as
if
we
are
going
below
for
a
clean
handkerchief
or
a
veil
or
a
cigarette
we
stroll
down
the
great
staircase
of
the
liner
to
the
turners
and
close
the
door
and
i
kiss
her
