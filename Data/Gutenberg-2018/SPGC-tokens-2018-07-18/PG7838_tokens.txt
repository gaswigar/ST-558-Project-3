fame
singing
in
the
highways
and
trifling
as
she
sang
with
sordid
adventurers
passed
the
poet
by
and
still
the
poet
made
for
her
little
chaplets
of
song
to
deck
her
forehead
in
the
courts
of
time
and
still
she
wore
instead
the
worthless
garlands
that
boisterous
citizens
flung
to
her
in
the
ways
made
out
of
perishable
things
and
after
a
while
whenever
these
garlands
died
the
poet
came
to
her
with
his
chaplets
of
song
and
still
she
laughed
at
him
and
wore
the
worthless
wreaths
though
they
always
died
at
evening
and
one
day
in
his
bitterness
the
poet
rebuked
her
and
said
to
her
lovely
fame
even
in
the
highways
and
the
byways
you
have
not
foreborne
to
laugh
and
shout
and
jest
with
worthless
men
and
i
have
toiled
for
you
and
dreamed
of
you
and
you
mock
me
and
pass
me
by
and
fame
turned
her
back
on
him
and
walked
away
but
in
departing
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
smiled
at
him
as
she
had
not
smiled
before
and
almost
speaking
in
a
whisper
said
i
will
meet
you
in
the
graveyard
at
the
back
of
the
workhouse
in
a
hundred
years
charon
charon
leaned
forward
and
rowed
all
things
were
one
with
his
weariness
it
was
not
with
him
a
matter
of
years
or
of
centuries
but
of
wide
floods
of
time
and
an
old
heaviness
and
a
pain
in
the
arms
that
had
become
for
him
part
of
the
scheme
that
the
gods
had
made
and
was
of
a
piece
with
eternity
if
the
gods
had
even
sent
him
a
contrary
wind
it
would
have
divided
all
time
in
his
memory
into
two
equal
slabs
so
grey
were
all
things
always
where
he
was
that
if
any
radiance
lingered
a
moment
among
the
dead
on
the
face
of
such
a
queen
perhaps
as
cleopatra
his
eyes
could
not
have
perceived
it
it
was
strange
that
the
dead
nowadays
were
coming
in
such
numbers
they
were
coming
in
thousands
where
they
used
to
come
in
fifties
it
was
neither
charon
duty
nor
his
wont
to
ponder
in
his
grey
soul
why
these
things
might
be
charon
leaned
forward
and
rowed
then
no
one
came
for
a
while
it
was
not
usual
for
the
gods
to
send
no
one
down
from
earth
for
such
a
space
but
the
gods
knew
best
then
one
man
came
alone
and
the
little
shade
sat
shivering
on
a
lonely
bench
and
the
great
boat
pushed
off
only
one
passenger
the
gods
knew
best
and
great
and
weary
charon
rowed
on
and
on
beside
the
little
silent
shivering
ghost
and
the
sound
of
the
river
was
like
a
mighty
sigh
that
grief
in
the
beginning
had
sighed
among
her
sisters
and
that
could
not
die
like
the
echoes
of
human
sorrow
failing
on
earthly
hills
but
was
as
old
as
time
and
the
pain
in
charon
arms
then
the
boat
from
the
slow
grey
river
loomed
up
to
the
coast
of
dis
and
the
little
silent
shade
still
shivering
stepped
ashore
and
charon
turned
the
boat
to
go
wearily
back
to
the
world
then
the
little
shadow
spoke
that
had
been
a
man
i
am
the
last
he
said
no
one
had
ever
made
charon
smile
before
no
one
before
had
ever
made
him
weep
the
death
of
pan
when
the
travellers
from
london
entered
arcady
they
lamented
one
to
another
the
death
of
pan
and
anon
they
saw
him
lying
stiff
and
still
horned
pan
was
still
and
the
dew
was
on
his
fur
he
had
not
the
look
of
a
live
animal
and
then
they
said
it
is
true
that
pan
is
dead
and
standing
melancholy
by
that
huge
prone
body
they
looked
for
long
at
memorable
pan
and
evening
came
and
a
small
star
appeared
and
presently
from
a
hamlet
of
some
arcadian
valley
with
a
sound
of
idle
song
arcadian
maidens
came
and
when
they
saw
there
suddenly
in
the
twilight
that
old
recumbent
god
they
stopped
in
their
running
and
whispered
among
themselves
how
silly
he
looks
they
said
and
thereat
they
laughed
a
little
and
at
the
sound
of
their
laughter
pan
leaped
up
and
the
gravel
flew
from
his
hooves
and
for
as
long
as
the
travellers
stood
and
listened
the
crags
and
the
of
arcady
rang
with
the
sounds
of
pursuit
the
sphinx
at
gizeh
i
saw
the
other
day
the
sphinx
painted
face
she
had
painted
her
face
in
order
to
ogle
time
and
he
has
spared
no
other
painted
face
in
all
the
world
but
hers
delilah
was
younger
than
she
and
delilah
is
dust
time
hath
loved
nothing
but
this
worthless
painted
face
i
do
not
care
that
she
is
ugly
nor
that
she
has
painted
her
face
so
that
she
only
lure
his
secret
from
time
time
dallies
like
a
fool
at
her
feet
when
he
should
be
smiting
cities
time
never
wearies
of
her
silly
smile
there
are
temples
all
about
her
that
he
has
forgotten
to
spoil
i
saw
an
old
man
go
by
and
time
never
touched
him
time
that
has
carried
away
the
seven
gates
of
thebes
she
has
tried
to
bind
him
with
ropes
of
eternal
sand
she
had
hoped
to
oppress
him
with
the
pyramids
he
lies
there
in
the
sand
with
his
foolish
hair
all
spread
about
her
paws
if
she
ever
finds
his
secret
we
will
put
out
his
eyes
so
that
he
shall
find
no
more
our
beautiful
things
there
are
lovely
gates
in
florence
that
i
fear
he
will
carry
away
we
have
tried
to
bind
him
with
song
and
with
old
customs
but
they
only
held
him
for
a
little
while
and
he
has
always
smitten
us
and
mocked
us
when
he
is
blind
he
shall
dance
to
us
and
make
sport
great
clumsy
time
shall
stumble
and
dance
who
liked
to
kill
little
children
and
can
hurt
even
the
daisies
no
longer
then
shall
our
children
laugh
at
him
who
slew
babylon
winged
bulls
and
smote
great
numbers
of
the
gods
and
fairies
when
he
is
shorn
of
his
hours
and
his
years
we
will
shut
him
up
in
the
pyramid
of
cheops
in
the
great
chamber
where
the
sarcophagus
is
thence
we
will
lead
him
out
when
we
give
our
feasts
he
shall
ripen
our
corn
for
us
and
do
menial
work
we
will
kiss
they
painted
face
o
sphinx
if
thou
wilt
betray
to
us
time
and
yet
i
fear
that
in
his
ultimate
anguish
he
may
take
hold
blindly
of
the
world
and
the
moon
and
slowly
pull
down
upon
him
the
house
of
man
the
hen
all
along
the
farmyard
gables
the
swallows
sat
twittering
uneasily
to
one
another
telling
of
many
things
but
thinking
only
of
summer
and
the
south
for
autumn
was
afoot
and
the
north
wind
waiting
and
suddenly
one
day
they
were
all
quite
gone
and
everyone
spoke
of
the
swallows
and
the
south
i
think
i
shall
go
south
myself
next
year
said
a
hen
and
the
year
wore
on
and
the
swallows
came
again
and
the
year
wore
on
and
they
sat
again
on
the
gables
and
all
the
poultry
discussed
the
departure
of
the
hen
and
very
early
one
morning
the
wind
being
from
the
north
the
swallows
all
soared
suddenly
and
felt
the
wind
in
their
wings
and
a
strength
came
upon
them
and
a
strange
old
knowledge
and
a
more
than
human
faith
and
flying
high
they
left
the
smoke
of
our
cities
and
small
remembered
eaves
and
saw
at
last
the
huge
and
homeless
sea
and
steering
by
grey
went
southward
with
the
wind
and
going
south
they
went
by
glittering
and
saw
old
islands
lifting
their
heads
above
them
they
saw
the
slow
quests
of
the
wandering
ships
and
divers
seeking
pearls
and
lands
at
war
till
there
came
in
view
the
mountains
that
they
sought
and
the
sight
of
the
peaks
they
knew
and
they
descended
into
an
austral
valley
and
saw
summer
sometimes
sleeping
and
sometimes
singing
song
i
think
the
wind
is
about
right
said
the
hen
and
she
spread
her
wings
and
ran
out
of
the
and
she
ran
fluttering
out
on
to
the
road
and
some
way
down
it
until
she
came
to
a
garden
at
evening
she
came
back
panting
and
in
the
she
told
the
poultry
how
she
had
gone
south
as
far
as
the
high
road
and
saw
the
great
world
traffic
going
by
and
came
to
lands
where
the
potato
grew
and
saw
the
stubble
upon
which
men
live
and
at
the
end
of
the
road
had
found
a
garden
and
there
were
roses
in
it
beautiful
roses
and
the
gardener
himself
was
there
with
his
braces
on
how
extremely
interesting
the
poultry
said
and
what
a
really
beautiful
description
and
the
winter
wore
away
and
the
bitter
months
went
by
and
the
spring
of
the
year
appeared
and
the
swallows
came
again
we
have
been
to
the
south
they
said
and
the
valleys
beyond
the
sea
but
the
poultry
would
not
agree
that
there
was
a
sea
in
the
south
you
should
hear
our
hen
they
said
wind
and
fog
way
for
us
said
the
north
wind
as
he
came
down
the
sea
on
an
errand
of
old
winter
and
he
saw
before
him
the
grey
silent
fog
that
lay
along
the
tides
way
for
us
said
the
north
wind
o
ineffectual
fog
for
i
am
winter
leader
in
his
war
with
the
ships
i
overwhelm
them
suddenly
in
my
strength
or
drive
upon
them
the
huge
seafaring
bergs
i
cross
an
ocean
while
you
move
a
mile
there
is
mourning
in
inland
places
when
i
have
met
the
ships
i
drive
them
upon
the
rocks
and
feed
the
sea
wherever
i
appear
they
bow
to
our
lord
the
winter
and
to
his
arrogant
boasting
nothing
said
the
fog
only
he
rose
up
slowly
and
trailed
away
from
the
sea
and
crawling
up
long
valleys
took
refuge
among
the
hills
and
night
came
down
and
everything
was
still
and
the
fog
began
to
mumble
in
the
stillness
and
i
heard
him
telling
infamously
to
himself
the
tale
of
his
horrible
spoils
a
hundred
and
fifteen
galleons
of
old
spain
a
certain
argosy
that
went
from
tyre
eight
and
ninety
ships
of
the
line
twelve
warships
under
sail
with
their
carronades
three
hundred
and
merchantmen
that
carried
spice
four
quinquiremes
ten
triremes
thirty
yachts
battleships
of
the
modern
time
nine
thousand
admirals
he
mumbled
and
chuckled
on
till
i
suddenly
arose
and
fled
from
his
fearful
contamination
the
all
we
who
write
put
me
in
mind
of
sailors
hastily
making
rafts
upon
doomed
ships
when
we
break
up
under
the
heavy
years
and
go
down
into
eternity
with
all
that
is
ours
our
thoughts
like
small
lost
rafts
float
on
awhile
upon
oblivion
sea
they
will
not
carry
much
over
those
tides
our
names
and
a
phrase
or
two
and
little
else
they
that
write
as
a
trade
to
please
the
whim
of
the
day
they
are
like
sailors
that
work
at
the
rafts
only
to
warm
their
hands
and
to
distract
their
thoughts
from
their
certain
doom
their
rafts
go
all
to
pieces
before
the
ship
breaks
up
see
now
oblivion
shimmering
all
around
us
its
very
tranquility
deadlier
than
tempest
how
little
all
our
keels
have
troubled
it
time
in
its
deeps
swims
like
a
monstrous
whale
and
like
a
whale
feeds
on
the
littlest
things
small
tunes
and
little
unskilled
songs
of
the
olden
golden
evenings
and
anon
turneth
to
overthrow
whole
ships
see
now
the
wreckage
of
babylon
floating
idly
and
something
there
that
once
was
nineveh
already
their
kings
and
queens
are
in
the
deeps
among
the
weedy
masses
of
old
centuries
that
hide
the
sodden
bulk
of
sunken
tyre
and
make
a
darkness
round
persepolis
for
the
rest
i
dimly
see
the
forms
of
foundered
ships
on
the
strewn
with
crowns
our
ships
were
all
unseaworthy
from
the
first
there
goes
the
raft
that
homer
made
for
helen
the
workman
i
saw
a
workman
fall
with
his
scaffolding
right
from
the
summit
of
some
vast
hotel
and
as
he
came
down
i
saw
him
holding
a
knife
and
trying
to
cut
his
name
on
the
scaffolding
he
had
time
to
try
and
do
this
for
he
must
have
had
nearly
three
hundred
feet
to
fall
and
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
his
folly
in
doing
this
futile
thing
for
not
only
would
the
man
be
unrecognizably
dead
in
three
seconds
but
the
very
pole
on
which
he
tried
to
scratch
whatever
of
his
name
he
had
time
for
was
certain
to
be
burnt
in
a
few
weeks
for
firewood
then
i
went
home
for
i
had
work
to
do
and
all
that
evening
i
thought
of
the
man
folly
till
the
thought
hindered
me
from
serious
work
and
late
that
night
while
i
was
still
at
work
the
ghost
of
the
workman
floated
through
my
wall
and
stood
before
me
laughing
i
heard
no
sound
until
after
i
spoke
to
it
but
i
could
see
the
grey
diaphanous
form
standing
before
me
shuddering
with
laughter
i
spoke
at
last
and
asked
what
it
was
laughing
at
and
then
the
ghost
spoke
it
said
i
a
laughin
at
you
sittin
and
workin
there
and
why
i
asked
do
you
laugh
at
serious
work
why
yer
bloomin
life
go
by
like
a
wind
he
said
and
yer
silly
civilization
be
tidied
up
in
a
few
centuries
then
he
fell
to
laughing
again
and
this
time
audibly
and
laughing
still
faded
back
through
the
wall
again
and
into
the
eternity
from
which
he
had
come
the
guest
a
young
man
came
into
an
ornate
restaurant
at
eight
in
london
he
was
alone
but
two
places
had
been
laid
at
the
table
which
was
reserved
for
him
he
had
chosen
the
dinner
very
carefully
by
letter
a
week
before
a
waiter
asked
him
about
the
other
guest
you
probably
wo
see
him
till
the
coffee
comes
the
young
man
told
him
so
he
was
served
alone
those
at
adjacent
tables
might
have
noticed
the
young
man
continually
addressing
the
empty
chair
and
carrying
on
a
monologue
with
it
throughout
his
elaborate
dinner
i
think
you
knew
my
father
he
said
to
it
over
the
soup
i
sent
for
you
this
evening
he
continued
because
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
good
turn
in
fact
i
must
insist
on
it
there
was
nothing
eccentric
about
the
man
except
for
this
habit
of
addressing
an
empty
chair
certainly
he
was
eating
as
good
a
dinner
as
any
sane
man
could
wish
for
after
the
burgundy
had
been
served
he
became
more
voluble
in
his
monologue
not
that
he
spoiled
his
wine
by
drinking
excessively
we
have
several
acquaintances
in
common
he
said
i
met
king
seti
a
year
ago
in
thebes
i
think
he
has
altered
very
little
since
you
knew
him
i
thought
his
forehead
a
little
low
for
a
king
cheops
has
left
the
house
that
he
built
for
your
reception
he
must
have
prepared
for
you
for
years
and
years
i
suppose
you
have
seldom
been
entertained
like
that
i
ordered
this
dinner
over
a
week
ago
i
thought
then
that
a
lady
might
have
come
with
me
but
as
she
would
i
asked
you
she
may
not
after
all
be
as
lovely
as
helen
of
troy
was
helen
very
lovely
not
when
you
knew
her
perhaps
you
were
lucky
in
cleopatra
you
must
have
known
her
when
she
was
in
her
prime
you
never
knew
the
mermaids
nor
the
fairies
nor
the
lovely
goddesses
of
long
ago
that
where
we
have
the
best
of
you
he
was
silent
when
the
waiters
came
to
his
table
but
rambled
merrily
on
as
soon
as
they
left
still
turned
to
the
empty
chair
you
know
i
saw
you
here
in
london
only
the
other
day
you
were
on
a
motor
bus
going
down
ludgate
hill
it
was
going
much
too
fast
london
is
a
good
place
but
i
shall
be
glad
enough
to
leave
it
it
was
in
london
that
i
met
the
lady
i
that
was
speaking
about
if
it
been
for
london
i
probably
should
have
met
her
and
if
it
been
for
london
she
probably
would
have
had
so
much
besides
me
to
amuse
her
it
cuts
both
ways
he
paused
once
to
order
coffee
gazing
earnestly
at
the
waiter
and
putting
a
sovereign
in
his
hand
do
let
it
be
chicory
said
he
the
waiter
brought
the
coffee
and
the
young
man
dropped
a
tabloid
of
some
sort
into
his
cup
i
do
suppose
you
come
here
very
often
he
went
on
well
you
probably
want
to
be
going
i
have
taken
you
much
out
of
your
way
there
is
plenty
for
you
to
do
in
london
then
having
drunk
his
coffee
he
fell
on
to
the
floor
by
a
foot
of
the
empty
chair
and
a
doctor
who
was
dining
in
the
room
bent
over
him
and
announced
to
the
anxious
manager
the
visible
presence
of
the
young
man
guest
death
and
odysseus
in
the
olympian
courts
love
laughed
at
death
because
he
was
unsightly
and
because
she
could
help
it
and
because
he
never
did
anything
worth
doing
and
because
she
would
and
death
hated
being
laughed
at
and
used
to
brood
apart
thinking
only
of
his
wrongs
and
of
what
he
could
do
to
end
this
intolerable
treatment
but
one
day
death
appeared
in
the
courts
with
an
air
and
they
all
noticed
it
what
are
you
up
to
now
said
love
and
death
with
some
solemnity
said
to
her
i
am
going
to
frighten
odysseus
and
drawing
about
him
his
grey
traveller
cloak
went
out
through
the
windy
door
with
his
jowl
turned
earthwards
and
he
came
soon
to
ithaca
and
the
hall
that
athene
knew
and
opened
the
door
and
saw
there
famous
odysseus
with
his
white
locks
bending
close
over
the
fire
trying
to
warm
his
hands
and
the
wind
through
the
open
door
blew
bitterly
on
odysseus
and
death
came
up
behind
him
and
suddenly
shouted
and
odysseus
went
on
warming
his
pale
hands
then
death
came
close
and
began
to
mouth
at
him
and
after
a
while
odysseus
turned
and
spoke
and
well
old
servant
he
said
have
your
masters
been
kind
to
you
since
i
made
you
work
for
me
round
ilion
and
death
for
some
while
stood
mute
for
he
thought
of
the
laughter
of
love
then
come
now
said
odysseus
lend
me
your
shoulder
and
he
leaning
heavily
on
that
bony
joint
they
went
together
through
the
open
door
death
and
the
orange
two
dark
young
men
in
a
foreign
southern
land
sat
at
a
restaurant
table
with
one
woman
and
on
the
woman
plate
was
a
small
orange
which
had
an
evil
laughter
in
its
heart
and
both
of
the
men
would
be
looking
at
the
woman
all
the
time
and
they
ate
little
and
they
drank
much
and
the
woman
was
smiling
equally
at
each
then
the
small
orange
that
had
the
laughter
in
its
heart
rolled
slowly
off
the
plate
on
to
the
floor
and
the
dark
young
men
both
sought
for
it
at
once
and
they
met
suddenly
beneath
the
table
and
soon
they
were
speaking
swift
words
to
one
another
and
a
horror
and
an
impotence
came
over
the
reason
of
each
as
she
sat
helpless
at
the
back
of
the
mind
and
the
heart
of
the
orange
laughed
and
the
woman
went
on
smiling
and
death
who
was
sitting
at
another
table
with
an
old
man
rose
and
came
over
to
listen
to
the
quarrel
the
prayer
of
the
flowers
it
was
the
voice
of
the
flowers
on
the
west
wind
the
lovable
the
old
the
lazy
west
wind
blowing
ceaselessly
blowing
sleepily
going
greecewards
the
woods
have
gone
away
they
have
fallen
and
left
us
men
love
us
no
longer
we
are
lonely
by
moonlight
great
engines
rush
over
the
beautiful
fields
their
ways
lie
hard
and
terrible
up
and
down
the
land
the
cancrous
cities
spread
over
the
grass
they
clatter
in
their
lairs
continually
they
glitter
about
us
blemishing
the
night
the
woods
are
gone
o
pan
the
woods
the
woods
and
thou
art
far
o
pan
and
far
away
i
was
standing
by
night
between
two
railway
embankments
on
the
edge
of
a
midland
city
on
one
of
them
i
saw
the
trains
go
by
once
in
every
two
minutes
and
on
the
other
the
trains
went
by
twice
in
every
five
quite
close
were
the
glaring
factories
and
the
sky
above
them
wore
the
fearful
look
that
it
wears
in
dreams
of
fever
the
flowers
were
right
in
the
stride
of
that
advancing
city
and
thence
i
heard
them
sending
up
their
cry
and
then
i
heard
beating
musically
up
wind
the
voice
of
pan
reproving
them
from
arcady
be
patient
a
little
these
things
are
not
for
long
time
and
the
tradesman
once
time
as
he
prowled
the
world
his
hair
grey
not
with
weakness
but
with
dust
of
the
ruin
of
cities
came
to
a
furniture
shop
and
entered
the
antique
department
and
there
he
saw
a
man
darkening
the
wood
of
a
chair
with
dye
and
beating
it
with
chains
and
making
imitation
wormholes
in
it
and
when
time
saw
another
doing
his
work
he
stood
by
him
awhile
and
looked
on
critically
and
at
last
he
said
that
is
not
how
i
work
and
he
turned
the
hair
white
and
bent
his
back
and
put
some
furrows
in
his
little
cunning
face
then
turned
and
strode
away
for
a
mighty
city
that
was
weary
and
sick
and
too
long
had
troubled
the
fields
was
sore
in
need
of
him
the
little
city
i
was
in
the
from
goraghwood
to
drogheda
when
i
suddenly
saw
the
city
it
was
a
little
city
in
a
valley
and
only
seemed
to
have
a
little
smoke
and
the
sun
caught
the
smoke
and
turned
it
golden
so
that
it
looked
like
an
old
italian
picture
where
angels
walk
in
the
foreground
and
the
rest
is
a
blaze
of
gold
and
beyond
as
one
could
tell
by
the
lie
of
land
although
one
could
not
see
through
the
golden
smoke
i
knew
that
there
lay
the
paths
of
the
roving
ships
all
round
there
lay
a
patchwork
of
small
fields
all
over
the
slopes
of
the
hills
and
the
snow
had
come
upon
them
tentatively
but
already
the
birds
of
the
waste
had
moved
to
the
sheltered
places
for
every
omen
boded
more
to
fall
far
away
some
little
hills
blazed
like
an
aureate
bulwark
broken
off
by
age
and
fallen
from
the
earthward
rampart
of
paradise
and
aloof
and
dark
the
mountains
stared
unconcernedly
seawards
and
when
i
saw
those
grey
and
watchful
mountains
sitting
where
they
sat
while
the
cities
of
the
civilization
of
araby
and
asia
arose
like
crocuses
and
like
crocuses
fell
i
wondered
for
how
long
there
would
be
smoke
in
the
valley
and
little
fields
on
the
hills
the
unpasturable
fields
thus
spake
the
mountains
behold
us
even
us
the
old
ones
the
grey
ones
that
wear
the
feet
of
time
time
on
our
rocks
shall
break
his
staff
and
stumble
and
still
we
shall
sit
majestic
even
as
now
hearing
the
sound
of
the
sea
our
old
coeval
sister
who
nurses
the
bones
of
her
children
and
weeps
for
the
things
she
has
done
far
far
we
stand
above
all
things
befriending
the
little
cities
until
they
grow
old
and
leave
us
to
go
among
the
myths
we
are
the
most
imperishable
mountains
and
softly
the
clouds
foregathered
from
far
places
and
crag
on
crag
and
mountain
upon
mountain
in
the
likeness
of
caucasus
upon
himalaya
came
riding
past
the
sunlight
upon
the
backs
of
storms
and
looked
down
idly
from
their
golden
heights
upon
the
crests
of
the
mountains
ye
pass
away
said
the
mountains
and
the
clouds
answered
as
i
dreamed
or
fancied
we
pass
away
indeed
we
pass
away
but
upon
our
unpasturable
fields
pegasus
prances
here
pegasus
gallops
and
browses
upon
song
which
the
larks
bring
to
him
every
morning
from
far
terrestrial
fields
his
ring
upon
our
slopes
at
sunrise
as
though
our
fields
were
of
silver
and
breathing
the
in
dilated
nostrils
with
head
tossed
upwards
and
with
quivering
wings
he
stands
and
stares
from
our
tremendous
heights
and
snorts
and
sees
wonderful
wars
rage
in
the
creases
and
the
folds
of
the
togas
that
cover
the
knees
of
the
gods
the
worm
and
the
angel
as
he
crawled
from
the
tombs
of
the
fallen
a
worm
met
with
an
angel
and
together
they
looked
upon
the
kings
and
kingdoms
and
youths
and
maidens
and
the
cities
of
men
they
saw
the
old
men
heavy
in
their
chairs
and
heard
the
children
singing
in
the
fields
they
saw
far
wars
and
warriors
and
walled
towns
wisdom
and
wickedness
and
the
pomp
of
kings
and
the
people
of
all
the
lands
that
the
sunlight
knew
and
the
worm
spake
to
the
angel
saying
behold
my
food
be
dakeon
para
thina
poluphloisboio
thalassaes
murmured
the
angel
for
they
walked
by
the
sea
and
can
you
destroy
that
too
and
the
worm
paled
in
his
anger
to
a
greyness
ill
to
behold
for
for
three
thousand
years
he
had
tried
to
destroy
that
line
and
still
its
melody
was
ringing
in
his
head
the
songless
country
the
poet
came
unto
a
great
country
in
which
there
were
no
songs
and
he
lamented
gently
for
the
nation
that
had
not
any
little
foolish
songs
to
sing
to
itself
at
evening
and
at
last
he
said
i
will
make
for
them
myself
some
little
foolish
songs
so
that
they
may
be
merry
in
the
lanes
and
happy
by
the
fireside
and
for
some
days
he
made
for
them
aimless
songs
such
as
maidens
sing
on
the
hills
in
the
older
happier
countries
then
he
went
to
some
of
that
nation
as
they
sat
weary
with
the
work
of
the
day
and
said
to
them
i
have
made
you
some
aimless
songs
out
of
the
small
unreasonable
legends
that
are
somewhat
akin
to
the
wind
in
the
vales
of
my
childhood
and
you
may
care
to
sing
them
in
your
disconsolate
evenings
and
they
said
to
him
if
you
think
we
have
time
for
that
sort
of
nonsense
nowadays
you
can
not
know
much
of
the
progress
of
modern
commerce
and
then
the
poet
wept
for
he
said
alas
they
are
damned
the
latest
thing
i
saw
an
by
the
banks
of
the
river
of
time
he
crouched
by
orchards
numerous
with
apples
in
a
happy
land
of
flowers
colossal
barns
stood
near
which
the
ancients
had
stored
with
grain
and
the
sun
was
golden
on
serene
far
hills
behind
the
level
lands
but
his
back
was
to
all
these
things
he
crouched
and
watched
the
river
and
whatever
the
river
chanced
to
send
him
down
the
clutched
at
greedily
with
his
arms
wading
out
into
the
water
now
there
were
in
those
days
and
indeed
still
are
certain
uncleanly
cities
upon
the
river
of
time
and
from
them
fearfully
nameless
things
came
floating
shapelessly
by
and
whenever
the
odor
of
these
came
down
the
river
before
them
the
plunged
into
the
dirty
water
and
stood
far
out
expectant
and
if
he
opened
his
mouth
one
saw
these
things
on
his
lips
indeed
from
the
upper
reaches
there
came
down
sometimes
the
fallen
rhododendron
petal
sometimes
a
rose
but
they
were
useless
to
the
and
when
he
saw
them
he
growled
a
poet
walked
beside
the
river
bank
his
head
was
lifted
and
his
look
was
afar
i
think
he
saw
the
sea
and
the
hills
of
fate
from
which
the
river
ran
i
saw
the
standing
voracious
up
to
his
waist
in
that
river
look
i
said
to
the
poet
the
current
will
sweep
him
away
the
poet
said
but
those
cities
that
poison
the
river
i
said
to
him
he
answered
whenever
the
centuries
melt
on
the
hills
of
fate
the
river
terribly
floods
the
demagogue
and
the
a
demagogue
and
a
chanced
to
arrive
together
at
the
gate
of
paradise
and
the
saint
looked
sorrowfully
at
them
both
why
were
you
a
demagogue
he
said
to
the
first
because
said
the
demagogue
i
stood
for
those
principles
that
have
made
us
what
we
are
and
have
endeared
our
party
to
the
great
heart
of
the
people
in
a
word
i
stood
unflinchingly
on
the
plank
of
popular
representation
and
you
said
the
saint
to
her
of
the
i
wanted
money
said
the
and
after
some
moments
thought
the
saint
said
well
come
in
though
you
do
deserve
to
but
to
the
demagogue
he
said
we
genuinely
regret
that
the
limited
space
at
our
disposal
and
our
unfortunate
lack
of
interest
in
those
questions
that
you
have
gone
so
far
to
inculate
and
have
so
ably
upheld
in
the
past
prevent
us
from
giving
you
the
support
for
which
you
seek
and
he
shut
the
golden
door
the
giant
poppy
i
dreamt
that
i
went
back
to
the
hills
i
knew
whence
on
a
clear
day
you
can
see
the
walls
of
ilion
and
the
plains
of
roncesvalles
there
used
to
be
woods
along
the
tops
of
those
hills
with
clearings
in
them
where
the
moonlight
fell
and
there
when
no
one
watched
the
fairies
danced
but
there
were
no
woods
when
i
went
back
no
fairies
nor
distant
glimpse
of
ilion
or
plains
of
roncesvalles
only
one
giant
poppy
waved
in
the
wind
and
as
it
waved
it
hummed
remember
not
and
by
its
stem
a
poet
sat
dressed
like
a
shepherd
and
playing
an
ancient
tune
softly
upon
a
pipe
i
asked
him
if
the
fairies
had
passed
that
way
or
anything
olden
he
said
the
poppy
has
grown
apace
and
is
killing
gods
and
fairies
its
fumes
are
suffocating
the
world
and
its
roots
drain
it
of
its
beautiful
strength
and
i
asked
him
why
he
sat
on
the
hills
i
knew
playing
an
olden
tune
and
he
answered
because
the
tune
is
bad
for
the
poppy
which
would
otherwise
grow
more
swiftly
and
because
if
the
brotherhood
of
which
i
am
one
were
to
cease
to
pipe
on
the
hills
men
would
stray
over
the
world
and
be
lost
or
come
to
terrible
ends
we
think
we
have
saved
agamemnon
then
he
fell
to
piping
again
that
olden
tune
while
the
wind
among
the
poppy
sleepy
petals
murmured
remember
not
remember
not
roses
i
know
a
roadside
where
the
wild
rose
blooms
with
a
strange
abundance
there
is
a
beauty
in
the
blossoms
too
of
an
almost
exotic
kind
a
taint
of
deeper
pink
that
shocks
the
puritan
flowers
two
hundred
generations
ago
generations
i
mean
of
roses
this
was
a
village
street
there
was
a
floral
decadence
when
they
left
their
simple
life
and
the
roses
came
from
the
wilderness
to
clamber
round
houses
of
men
of
all
the
memories
of
that
little
village
of
all
the
cottages
that
stood
there
of
all
the
men
and
women
whose
homes
they
were
nothing
remains
but
a
more
beautiful
blush
on
the
faces
of
the
roses
i
hope
that
when
london
is
clean
passed
away
and
the
defeated
fields
come
back
again
like
an
exiled
people
returning
after
a
war
they
may
find
some
beautiful
thing
to
remind
them
of
it
all
because
we
have
loved
a
little
that
swart
old
city
the
man
with
the
golden
it
may
be
that
i
dreamed
this
so
much
at
least
is
certain
that
i
turned
one
day
from
the
traffic
of
a
city
and
came
to
its
docks
and
saw
its
slimy
wharves
going
down
green
and
steep
into
the
water
and
saw
the
huge
grey
river
slipping
by
and
the
lost
things
that
went
with
it
turning
over
and
over
and
i
thought
of
the
nations
and
unpitying
time
and
saw
and
marvelled
at
the
queenly
ships
come
newly
from
the
sea
it
was
then
if
i
mistake
not
that
i
saw
leaning
against
a
wall
with
his
face
to
the
ships
a
man
with
golden
his
skin
had
the
dark
tint
of
the
southern
men
the
deep
black
hairs
of
his
moustache
were
whitened
a
little
with
salt
he
wore
a
dark
blue
jacket
such
as
sailors
wear
and
the
long
boots
of
seafarers
but
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
further
afield
than
the
ships
he
seemed
to
be
beholding
the
farthest
things
even
when
i
spoke
to
him
he
did
not
call
home
that
look
but
answered
me
dreamily
with
that
same
fixed
stare
as
though
his
thoughts
were
heaving
on
far
and
lonely
seas
i
asked
him
what
ship
he
had
come
by
for
there
were
many
there
the
sailing
ships
were
there
with
their
sails
all
furled
and
their
masts
straight
and
still
like
a
wintry
forest
the
steamers
were
there
and
great
liners
puffing
up
idle
smoke
into
the
twilight
he
answered
he
had
come
by
none
of
them
i
asked
him
what
line
he
worked
on
for
he
was
clearly
a
sailor
i
mentioned
lines
but
he
did
not
know
them
then
i
asked
him
where
he
worked
and
what
he
was
and
he
said
i
work
in
the
sargasso
sea
and
i
am
the
last
of
the
pirates
the
last
left
alive
and
i
shook
him
by
the
hand
i
do
not
know
how
many
times
i
said
we
feared
you
were
dead
we
feared
you
were
dead
and
he
answered
sadly
no
no
i
have
sinned
too
deeply
on
the
spanish
seas
i
am
not
allowed
to
die
the
dream
of
king
king
sitting
on
his
throne
commanding
all
things
said
i
very
clearly
saw
last
night
the
queenly
though
partly
she
was
hidden
by
great
clouds
that
swept
continually
by
her
rolling
over
and
over
yet
her
face
was
unhidden
and
shone
being
full
of
moonlight
i
said
to
her
with
me
by
the
great
pools
in
beautiful
istrakhan
where
the
lilies
float
that
give
delectable
dreams
or
drawing
aside
the
curtain
of
hanging
orchids
pass
with
me
thence
from
the
pools
by
a
secret
path
through
the
else
impassable
jungle
that
fills
the
only
way
between
the
mountains
that
shut
in
istrakhan
they
shut
it
in
and
look
on
it
with
joy
at
morning
and
at
evening
when
the
pools
are
strange
with
light
till
in
their
gladness
sometimes
there
melts
the
deadly
snow
that
kills
upon
lonely
heights
the
mountaineer
they
have
valleys
among
them
older
than
the
wrinkles
in
the
moon
with
me
thence
or
linger
with
me
there
and
either
we
shall
come
to
romantic
lands
which
the
men
of
the
caravans
only
speak
of
in
song
or
else
we
shall
listlessly
walk
in
a
land
so
lovely
that
even
the
butterflies
that
float
about
it
when
they
see
their
images
flash
in
the
sacred
pools
are
terrified
by
their
beauty
and
each
night
we
shall
hear
the
myriad
nightingales
all
in
one
chorus
sing
the
stars
to
death
do
this
and
i
will
send
heralds
far
from
here
with
tidings
of
thy
beauty
and
they
shall
run
and
come
to
séndara
and
men
shall
know
it
there
who
herd
brown
sheep
and
from
séndara
the
rumour
shall
spread
on
down
either
bank
of
the
holy
river
of
zoth
till
the
people
that
make
wattles
in
the
plains
shall
hear
of
it
and
sing
but
the
heralds
shall
go
northward
along
the
hills
until
they
come
to
sooma
and
in
that
golden
city
they
shall
tell
the
kings
that
sit
in
their
lofty
alabaster
house
of
thy
strange
and
sudden
smiles
and
often
in
distant
markets
shall
thy
story
be
told
by
merchants
out
from
sooma
as
they
sit
telling
careless
tales
to
lure
men
to
their
wares
the
heralds
passing
thence
shall
come
even
to
ingra
to
ingra
where
they
dance
and
there
they
shall
tell
of
thee
so
that
thy
name
long
hence
shall
be
sung
in
that
joyous
city
and
there
they
shall
borrow
camels
and
pass
over
the
sands
and
go
by
desert
ways
to
distant
nirid
to
tell
of
thee
to
the
lonely
men
in
the
mountain
monasteries
with
me
even
now
for
it
is
spring
and
as
i
said
this
she
faintly
yet
perceptibly
shook
her
head
and
it
was
only
then
i
remembered
my
youth
was
gone
and
she
dead
forty
years
the
storm
they
saw
a
little
ship
that
was
far
at
sea
and
that
went
by
the
name
of
the
and
because
of
its
uncouth
rig
and
its
lonely
air
and
the
look
that
it
had
of
coming
from
strangers
lands
they
said
it
is
neither
a
ship
to
greet
nor
desire
nor
yet
to
succor
when
in
the
hands
of
the
sea
and
the
sea
rose
up
as
is
the
wont
of
the
sea
and
the
little
ship
from
afar
was
in
his
hands
and
frailer
than
ever
seemed
its
feeble
masts
with
their
sails
of
fantastic
cut
and
their
alien
flags
and
the
sea
made
a
great
and
very
triumphing
voice
as
the
sea
doth
and
then
there
arose
a
wave
that
was
very
strong
even
the
son
of
the
hurricane
and
the
tide
and
hid
the
little
ship
and
hid
the
whole
of
the
far
parts
of
the
sea
thereat
said
those
who
stood
on
the
good
dry
land
was
but
a
little
worthless
alien
ship
and
it
is
sunk
at
sea
and
it
is
good
and
right
that
the
storm
have
spoil
and
they
turned
and
watched
the
course
of
the
laden
with
silver
and
appeasing
spice
year
after
year
they
cheered
them
into
port
and
praised
their
goods
and
their
familiar
sails
and
many
years
went
by
and
at
last
with
decks
and
bulwarks
covered
with
cloth
of
gold
with
parrots
that
had
known
the
troubadours
singing
illustrious
songs
and
preening
their
feathers
of
gold
with
a
hold
full
of
emeralds
and
rubies
all
silken
with
indian
loot
furling
as
it
came
in
its
alien
sails
a
galleon
glided
into
port
shutting
the
sunlight
from
the
merchantmen
and
lo
it
loomed
the
equal
of
the
cliffs
who
are
you
they
asked
wonderful
ship
and
they
said
the
o
said
the
people
on
shore
we
thought
you
were
sunk
at
sea
sunk
at
sea
sang
the
sailors
we
could
not
be
sunk
at
sea
we
had
the
gods
on
board
a
mistaken
identity
fame
as
she
walked
at
evening
in
a
city
saw
the
painted
face
of
notoriety
flaunting
beneath
a
and
many
kneeled
unto
her
in
the
dirt
of
the
road
who
are
you
fame
said
to
her
i
am
fame
said
notoriety
then
fame
stole
softly
away
so
that
no
one
knew
she
had
gone
and
notoriety
presently
went
forth
and
all
her
worshippers
rose
and
followed
after
and
she
led
them
as
was
most
meet
to
her
native
pit
the
true
history
of
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
for
a
long
time
there
was
doubt
with
acrimony
among
the
beasts
as
to
whether
the
hare
or
the
tortoise
could
run
the
swifter
some
said
the
hare
was
the
swifter
of
the
two
because
he
had
such
long
ears
and
others
said
the
tortoise
was
the
swifter
because
anyone
whose
shell
was
so
hard
as
that
should
be
able
to
run
hard
too
and
lo
the
forces
of
estrangement
and
disorder
perpetually
postponed
a
decisive
contest
but
when
there
was
nearly
war
among
the
beasts
at
last
an
arrangement
was
come
to
and
it
was
decided
that
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
should
run
a
race
of
five
hundred
yards
so
that
all
should
see
who
was
right
ridiculous
nonsense
said
the
hare
and
it
was
all
his
backers
could
do
to
get
him
to
run
the
contest
is
most
welcome
to
me
said
the
tortoise
i
shall
not
shirk
it
o
how
his
backers
cheered
feeling
ran
high
on
the
day
of
the
race
the
goose
rushed
at
the
fox
and
nearly
pecked
him
both
sides
spoke
loudly
of
the
approaching
victory
up
to
the
very
moment
of
the
race
i
am
absolutely
confident
of
success
said
the
tortoise
but
the
hare
said
nothing
he
looked
bored
and
cross
some
of
his
supporters
deserted
him
then
and
went
to
the
other
side
who
were
loudly
cheering
the
tortoise
inspiriting
words
but
many
remained
with
the
hare
we
shall
not
be
disappointed
in
him
they
said
a
beast
with
such
long
ears
is
bound
to
win
run
hard
said
the
supporters
of
the
tortoise
and
run
hard
became
a
kind
of
which
everybody
repeated
to
one
another
hard
shell
and
hard
living
that
what
the
country
wants
run
hard
they
said
and
these
words
were
never
uttered
but
multitudes
cheered
from
their
hearts
then
they
were
off
and
suddenly
there
was
a
hush
the
hare
dashed
off
for
about
a
hundred
yards
then
he
looked
round
to
see
where
his
rival
was
it
is
rather
absurd
he
said
to
race
with
a
tortoise
and
he
sat
down
and
scratched
himself
run
hard
run
hard
shouted
some
let
him
rest
shouted
others
and
let
him
rest
became
a
too
and
after
a
while
his
rival
drew
near
to
him
there
comes
that
damned
tortoise
said
the
hare
and
he
got
up
and
ran
as
hard
as
could
be
so
that
he
should
not
let
the
tortoise
beat
him
those
ears
will
win
said
his
friends
those
ears
will
win
and
establish
upon
an
incontestable
footing
the
truth
of
what
we
have
said
and
some
of
them
turned
to
the
backers
of
the
tortoise
and
said
what
about
your
beast
now
run
hard
they
replied
run
hard
the
hare
ran
on
for
nearly
three
hundred
yards
nearly
in
fact
as
far
as
the
when
it
suddenly
struck
him
what
a
fool
he
looked
running
races
with
a
tortoise
who
was
nowhere
in
sight
and
he
sat
down
again
and
scratched
run
hard
run
hard
said
the
crowd
and
let
him
rest
whatever
is
the
use
of
it
said
the
hare
and
this
time
he
stopped
for
good
some
say
he
slept
there
was
desperate
excitement
for
an
hour
or
two
and
then
the
tortoise
won
run
hard
run
hard
shouted
his
backers
hard
shell
and
hard
living
that
what
has
done
it
and
then
they
asked
the
tortoise
what
his
achievement
signified
and
he
went
and
asked
the
turtle
and
the
turtle
said
it
is
a
glorious
victory
for
the
forces
of
swiftness
and
then
the
tortoise
repeated
it
to
his
friends
and
all
the
beasts
said
nothing
else
for
years
and
even
to
this
day
a
glorious
victory
for
the
forces
of
swiftness
is
a
in
the
house
of
the
snail
and
the
reason
that
this
version
of
the
race
is
not
widely
known
is
that
very
few
of
those
that
witnessed
it
survived
the
great
that
happened
shortly
after
it
came
up
over
the
weald
by
night
with
a
great
wind
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
and
a
very
few
of
the
beasts
saw
it
far
off
from
a
high
bare
hill
that
was
at
the
edge
of
the
trees
and
they
hurriedly
called
a
meeting
to
decide
what
messenger
they
should
send
to
warn
the
beasts
in
the
forest
they
sent
the
tortoise
alone
the
immortals
i
heard
it
said
that
far
away
from
here
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
deserts
of
cathay
and
in
a
country
dedicate
to
winter
are
all
the
years
that
are
dead
and
there
a
certain
valley
shuts
them
in
and
hides
them
as
rumor
has
it
from
the
world
but
not
from
the
sight
of
the
moon
nor
from
those
that
dream
in
his
rays
and
i
said
i
will
go
from
here
by
ways
of
dream
and
i
will
come
to
that
valley
and
enter
in
and
mourn
there
for
the
good
years
that
are
dead
and
i
said
i
will
take
a
wreath
a
wreath
of
mourning
and
lay
it
at
their
feet
in
token
of
my
sorrow
for
their
dooms
and
when
i
sought
about
among
the
flowers
among
the
flowers
for
my
wreath
of
mourning
the
lily
looked
too
large
and
the
laurel
looked
too
solemn
and
i
found
nothing
frail
enough
nor
slender
to
serve
as
an
offering
to
the
years
that
were
dead
and
at
last
i
made
a
slender
wreath
of
daisies
in
the
manner
that
i
had
seen
them
made
in
one
of
the
years
that
is
dead
this
said
i
is
scarce
less
fragile
or
less
frail
than
one
of
those
delicate
forgotten
years
then
i
took
my
wreath
in
my
hand
and
went
from
here
and
when
i
had
come
by
paths
of
mystery
to
that
romantic
land
where
the
valley
that
rumour
told
of
lies
close
to
the
mountainous
moon
i
searched
among
the
grass
for
those
poor
slight
years
for
whom
i
bought
my
sorrow
and
my
wreath
and
when
i
found
there
nothing
in
the
grass
i
said
time
has
shattered
them
and
swept
them
away
and
left
not
even
any
faint
remains
but
looking
upwards
in
the
blaze
of
the
moon
i
suddenly
saw
colossi
sitting
near
and
towering
up
and
blotting
out
the
stars
and
filling
the
night
with
blackness
and
at
those
idols
feet
i
saw
praying
and
making
obeisance
kings
and
the
days
that
are
and
all
times
and
all
cities
and
all
nations
and
all
their
gods
neither
the
smoke
of
incense
nor
of
the
sacrifice
burning
reached
those
colossal
heads
they
sat
there
not
to
be
measured
not
to
be
not
to
be
worn
away
i
said
who
are
those
one
answered
alone
the
immortals
and
i
said
sadly
i
came
not
to
see
dread
gods
but
i
came
to
shed
my
tears
and
to
offer
flowers
at
the
feet
of
certain
little
years
that
are
dead
and
may
not
come
again
he
answered
me
these
the
years
that
are
dead
alone
the
immortals
all
years
to
be
are
their
children
they
fashioned
their
smiles
and
their
laughter
all
earthly
kings
they
have
crowned
all
gods
they
have
created
all
the
events
to
be
flow
down
from
their
feet
like
a
river
the
worlds
are
flying
pebbles
that
they
have
already
thrown
and
time
and
all
his
centuries
behind
him
kneel
there
with
bended
crests
in
token
of
vassalage
at
their
potent
feet
and
when
i
heard
this
i
turned
away
with
my
wreath
and
went
back
to
my
own
land
comforted
a
moral
little
tale
there
was
once
an
earnest
puritan
who
held
it
wrong
to
dance
and
for
his
principles
he
labored
hard
his
was
a
zealous
life
and
there
loved
him
all
of
those
who
hated
the
dance
and
those
that
loved
the
dance
respected
him
too
they
said
he
is
a
pure
good
man
and
acts
according
to
his
lights
he
did
much
to
discourage
dancing
and
helped
to
close
several
sunday
entertainments
some
kinds
of
poetry
he
said
he
liked
but
not
the
fanciful
kind
as
that
might
corrupt
the
thoughts
of
the
very
young
he
always
dressed
in
black
he
was
quite
interested
in
morality
and
was
quite
sincere
and
there
grew
to
be
much
respect
on
earth
for
his
honest
face
and
his
flowing
beard
one
night
the
devil
appeared
unto
him
in
a
dream
and
said
well
done
avaunt
said
that
earnest
man
no
no
friend
said
the
devil
dare
not
to
call
me
he
answered
bravely
come
come
friend
said
the
devil
have
you
not
done
my
work
have
you
not
put
apart
the
couples
that
would
dance
have
you
not
checked
their
laughter
and
their
accursed
mirth
have
you
not
worn
my
livery
of
black
o
friend
friend
you
do
not
know
what
a
detestable
thing
it
is
to
sit
in
hell
and
hear
people
being
happy
and
singing
in
theatres
and
singing
in
the
fields
and
whispering
after
dances
under
the
moon
and
he
fell
to
cursing
fearfully
it
is
you
said
the
puritan
that
put
into
their
hearts
the
evil
desire
to
dance
and
black
is
god
own
livery
not
yours
and
the
devil
laughed
contemptuously
and
spoke
he
only
made
the
silly
colors
he
said
and
useless
dawns
on
facing
south
and
butterflies
flapping
along
them
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
high
and
foolish
maidens
coming
out
to
dance
and
the
warm
mad
west
wind
and
worst
of
all
that
pernicious
influence
love
and
when
the
devil
said
that
god
made
love
that
earnest
man
sat
up
in
bed
and
shouted
blasphemy
blasphemy
it
true
said
the
devil
it
is
i
that
send
the
village
fools
muttering
and
whispering
two
by
two
in
the
woods
when
the
harvest
moon
is
high
it
as
much
as
i
can
bear
even
to
see
them
dancing
then
said
the
man
i
have
mistaken
right
for
wrong
but
as
soon
as
i
wake
i
will
fight
you
yet
o
no
you
do
said
the
devil
you
do
wake
up
out
of
this
sleep
and
somewhere
far
away
hell
black
steel
doors
were
opened
and
arm
in
arm
those
two
were
drawn
within
and
the
doors
shut
behind
them
and
still
they
went
arm
in
arm
trudging
further
and
further
into
the
deeps
of
hell
and
it
was
that
puritan
punishment
to
know
that
those
that
he
cared
for
on
earth
would
do
evil
as
he
had
done
the
return
of
song
the
swans
are
singing
again
said
to
one
another
the
gods
and
looking
downwards
for
my
dreams
had
taken
me
to
some
fair
and
far
valhalla
i
saw
below
me
an
iridescent
bubble
not
greatly
larger
than
a
star
shine
beautifully
but
faintly
and
up
and
up
from
it
looking
larger
and
larger
came
a
flock
of
white
innumerable
swans
singing
and
singing
and
singing
till
it
seemed
as
though
even
the
gods
were
wild
ships
swimming
in
music
what
is
it
i
said
to
one
that
was
humble
among
the
gods
only
a
world
has
ended
he
said
to
me
and
the
swans
are
coming
back
to
the
gods
returning
the
gift
of
song
a
whole
world
dead
i
said
dead
said
he
that
was
humble
among
the
gods
the
worlds
are
not
for
ever
only
song
is
immortal
look
look
he
said
there
will
be
a
new
one
soon
and
i
looked
and
saw
the
larks
going
down
from
the
gods
spring
in
town
at
a
street
corner
sat
and
played
with
a
wind
winter
disconsolate
still
tingled
the
fingers
of
the
and
still
their
breath
was
visible
and
still
they
huddled
their
chins
into
their
coats
when
turning
a
corner
they
met
with
a
new
wind
still
windows
lighted
early
sent
out
into
the
street
the
thought
of
romantic
comfort
by
evening
fires
these
things
still
were
yet
the
throne
of
winter
tottered
and
every
breeze
brought
tidings
of
further
fortresses
lost
on
lakes
or
boreal
and
not
any
longer
as
a
king
did
winter
appear
in
those
streets
as
when
the
city
was
decked
with
gleaming
white
to
greet
him
as
a
conqueror
and
he
rode
in
with
his
glittering
icicles
and
haughty
retinue
of
prancing
winds
but
he
sat
there
with
a
little
wind
at
the
corner
of
the
street
like
some
old
blind
beggar
with
his
hungry
dog
and
as
to
some
old
blind
beggar
death
approaches
and
the
alert
ears
of
the
sightless
man
prophetically
hear
his
footfall
so
there
came
suddenly
to
winter
ears
the
sound
from
some
neighbouring
garden
of
spring
approaching
as
she
walked
on
daisies
and
spring
approaching
looked
at
huddled
inglorious
winter
begone
said
spring
there
is
nothing
for
you
to
do
here
said
winter
to
her
nevertheless
he
drew
about
him
his
grey
and
battered
cloak
and
rose
and
called
to
his
little
bitter
wind
and
up
a
side
street
that
led
northward
strode
away
pieces
of
paper
and
tall
clouds
of
dust
went
with
him
as
far
as
the
outer
gate
he
turned
then
and
called
to
spring
you
can
do
nothing
in
this
city
he
said
then
he
marched
homeward
over
plains
and
sea
and
heard
his
old
winds
howling
as
he
marched
the
ice
broke
up
behind
him
and
foundered
like
navies
to
left
and
to
right
of
him
flew
the
flocks
of
the
and
far
before
him
the
geese
triumphant
cry
went
like
a
clarion
greater
and
greater
grew
his
stature
as
he
went
northwards
and
ever
more
kingly
his
mien
now
he
took
baronies
at
a
stride
and
now
counties
and
came
again
to
the
frozen
lands
where
the
wolves
came
out
to
meet
him
and
draping
himself
anew
with
old
grey
clouds
strode
through
the
gates
of
his
invincible
home
two
old
ice
barriers
swinging
on
pillars
of
ice
that
had
never
known
the
sun
so
the
town
was
left
to
spring
and
she
peered
about
to
see
what
she
could
do
with
it
presently
she
saw
a
dejected
dog
coming
prowling
down
the
road
so
she
sang
to
him
and
he
gambolled
i
saw
him
next
day
strutting
by
with
something
of
an
air
where
there
were
trees
she
went
to
them
and
whispered
and
they
sang
the
arboreal
song
that
only
trees
can
hear
and
the
green
buds
came
peeping
out
as
stars
while
yet
it
is
twilight
secretly
one
by
one
she
went
to
gardens
and
awaked
from
dreaming
the
warm
maternal
earth
in
little
patches
bare
and
desolate
she
called
up
like
a
flame
the
golden
crocus
or
its
purple
brother
like
an
emperor
ghost
she
gladdened
the
graceless
backs
of
untidy
houses
here
with
a
weed
there
with
a
little
grass
she
said
to
the
air
be
joyous
children
began
to
know
that
daisies
blew
in
unfrequented
corners
buttonholes
began
to
appear
in
the
coats
of
the
young
men
the
work
of
spring
was
accomplished
how
the
enemy
came
to
thlunrana
it
had
been
prophesied
of
old
and
foreseen
from
the
ancient
days
that
its
enemy
would
come
upon
thlunrana
and
the
date
of
its
doom
was
known
and
the
gate
by
which
it
would
enter
yet
none
had
prophesied
of
the
enemy
who
he
was
save
that
he
was
of
the
gods
though
he
dwelt
with
men
meanwhile
thlunrana
that
secret
lamaserai
that
chief
cathedral
of
wizardry
was
the
terror
of
the
valley
in
which
it
stood
and
of
all
lands
round
about
it
so
narrow
and
high
were
the
windows
and
so
strange
when
lighted
at
night
that
they
seemed
to
regard
men
with
the
demoniac
leer
of
something
that
had
a
secret
in
the
dark
who
were
the
magicians
and
the
and
the
great
of
that
furtive
place
nobody
knew
for
they
went
veiled
and
hooded
and
cloaked
completely
in
black
though
her
doom
was
close
upon
her
and
the
enemy
of
prophecy
should
come
that
very
night
through
the
open
southward
door
that
was
named
the
gate
of
the
doom
yet
that
rocky
edifice
thlunrana
remained
mysterious
still
venerable
terrible
dark
and
dreadfully
crowned
with
her
doom
it
was
not
often
that
anyone
dared
wander
near
to
thlunrana
by
night
when
the
moan
of
the
magicians
invoking
we
know
not
whom
rose
faintly
from
inner
chambers
scaring
the
drifting
bats
but
on
the
last
night
of
all
the
man
from
the
cottage
by
the
five
came
because
he
would
see
thlunrana
once
again
before
the
enemy
that
was
divine
but
that
dwelt
with
men
should
come
against
it
and
it
should
be
no
more
up
the
dark
valley
he
went
like
a
bold
man
but
his
fears
were
thick
upon
him
his
bravery
bore
their
weight
but
stooped
a
little
beneath
them
he
went
in
at
the
southward
gate
that
is
named
the
gate
of
the
doom
he
came
into
a
dark
hall
and
up
a
marble
stairway
passed
to
see
the
last
of
thlunrana
at
the
top
a
curtain
of
black
velvet
hung
and
he
passed
into
a
chamber
heavily
hung
with
curtains
with
a
gloom
in
it
that
was
blacker
than
anything
they
could
account
for
in
a
sombre
chamber
beyond
seen
through
a
vacant
archway
magicians
with
lighted
tapers
plied
their
wizardry
and
whispered
incantations
all
the
rats
in
the
place
were
passing
away
going
whimpering
down
the
stairway
the
man
from
the
cottage
passed
through
that
second
chamber
the
magicians
did
not
look
at
him
and
did
not
cease
to
whisper
he
passed
from
them
through
heavy
curtains
still
of
black
velvet
and
came
into
a
chamber
of
black
marble
where
nothing
stirred
only
one
taper
burned
in
the
third
chamber
there
were
no
windows
on
the
smooth
floor
and
under
the
smooth
wall
a
silk
pavilion
stood
with
its
curtains
drawn
close
together
this
was
the
holy
of
holies
of
that
ominous
place
its
inner
mystery
one
on
each
side
of
it
dark
figures
crouched
either
of
men
or
women
or
cloaked
stone
or
of
beasts
trained
to
be
silent
when
the
awful
stillness
of
the
mystery
was
more
than
he
could
bear
the
man
from
the
cottage
by
the
five
went
up
to
the
silk
pavilion
and
with
a
bold
and
nervous
clutch
of
the
hand
drew
one
of
the
curtains
aside
and
saw
the
inner
mystery
and
laughed
and
the
prophecy
was
fulfilled
and
thlunrana
was
never
more
a
terror
to
the
valley
but
the
magicians
passed
away
from
their
terrific
halls
and
fled
through
the
open
fields
wailing
and
beating
their
breasts
for
laughter
was
the
enemy
that
was
doomed
to
come
against
thlunrana
through
her
southward
gate
that
was
named
the
gate
of
the
doom
and
it
is
of
the
gods
but
dwells
with
man
a
losing
game
once
in
a
tavern
man
met
face
to
skull
with
death
man
entered
gaily
but
death
gave
no
greeting
he
sat
with
his
jowl
morosely
over
an
ominous
wine
come
come
said
man
we
have
been
antagonists
long
and
if
i
were
losing
yet
i
should
not
be
surly
but
death
remained
unfriendly
watching
his
bowl
of
wine
and
gave
no
word
in
answer
then
man
solicitously
moved
nearer
to
him
and
speaking
cheerily
still
come
come
he
said
again
you
must
not
resent
defeat
and
still
death
was
gloomy
and
cross
and
sipped
at
his
infamous
wine
and
would
not
look
up
at
man
and
would
not
be
companionable
but
man
hated
gloom
either
in
beast
or
god
and
it
made
him
unhappy
to
see
his
adversary
discomfort
all
the
more
because
he
was
the
cause
and
still
he
tried
to
cheer
him
have
you
not
slain
the
dinatherium
he
said
have
you
not
put
out
the
moon
why
you
will
beat
me
yet
and
with
a
dry
and
barking
sound
death
wept
and
nothing
said
and
presently
man
arose
and
went
wondering
away
for
he
knew
not
if
death
wept
out
of
pity
for
his
opponent
or
because
he
knew
that
he
should
not
have
such
sport
again
when
the
old
game
was
over
and
man
was
gone
or
whether
because
perhaps
for
some
hidden
reason
he
could
never
repeat
on
earth
his
triumph
over
the
moon
taking
up
picadilly
going
down
picadilly
one
day
and
nearing
grosvenor
place
i
saw
if
my
memory
is
not
at
fault
some
workmen
with
their
coats
off
or
so
they
seemed
they
had
pickaxes
in
their
hands
and
wore
corduroy
trousers
and
that
little
leather
band
below
the
knee
that
goes
by
the
astonishing
name
of
they
seemed
to
be
working
with
peculiar
vehemence
so
that
i
stopped
and
asked
one
what
they
were
doing
we
are
taking
up
picadilly
he
said
to
me
but
at
this
time
of
year
i
said
is
it
usual
in
june
we
are
not
what
we
seem
said
he
oh
i
see
i
said
you
are
doing
it
for
a
joke
well
not
exactly
that
he
answered
me
for
a
bet
i
said
not
precisely
said
he
and
then
i
looked
at
the
bit
that
they
had
already
picked
and
though
it
was
broad
daylight
over
my
head
it
was
darkness
down
there
all
full
of
the
southern
stars
it
was
noisy
and
bad
and
we
grew
aweary
of
it
said
he
that
wore
corduroy
trousers
we
are
not
what
we
appear
they
were
taking
up
picadilly
altogether
after
the
fire
when
that
happened
which
had
been
so
long
in
happening
and
the
world
hit
a
black
uncharted
star
certain
tremendous
creatures
out
of
some
other
world
came
peering
among
the
cinders
to
see
if
there
were
anything
there
that
it
were
worth
while
to
remember
they
spoke
of
the
great
things
that
the
world
was
known
to
have
had
they
mentioned
the
mammoth
and
presently
they
saw
man
temples
silent
and
windowless
staring
like
empty
skulls
some
great
thing
has
been
here
one
said
in
these
huge
places
it
was
the
mammoth
said
one
something
greater
than
he
said
another
and
then
they
found
that
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
had
been
the
dreams
of
man
the
city
in
time
as
well
as
space
my
fancy
roams
far
from
here
it
led
me
once
to
the
edge
of
certain
cliffs
that
were
low
and
red
and
rose
up
out
of
a
desert
a
little
way
off
in
the
desert
there
was
a
city
it
was
evening
and
i
sat
and
watched
the
city
presently
i
saw
men
by
threes
and
fours
come
softly
stealing
out
of
that
city
gate
to
the
number
of
about
twenty
i
heard
the
hum
of
men
voices
speaking
at
evening
it
is
well
they
are
gone
they
said
it
is
well
they
are
gone
we
can
do
business
now
it
is
well
they
are
gone
and
the
men
that
had
left
the
city
sped
away
over
the
sand
and
so
passed
into
the
twilight
who
are
these
men
i
said
to
my
glittering
leader
the
poets
my
fancy
answered
the
poets
and
artists
why
do
they
steal
away
i
said
to
him
and
why
are
the
people
glad
that
they
have
gone
he
said
it
must
be
some
doom
that
is
going
to
fall
on
the
city
something
has
warned
them
and
they
have
stolen
away
nothing
may
warn
the
people
i
heard
the
wrangling
voices
glad
with
commerce
rise
up
from
the
city
and
then
i
also
departed
for
there
was
an
ominous
look
on
the
face
of
the
sky
and
only
a
thousand
years
later
i
passed
that
way
and
there
was
nothing
even
among
the
weeds
of
what
had
been
that
city
the
food
of
death
death
was
sick
but
they
brought
him
bread
that
the
modern
bakers
make
whitened
with
alum
and
the
tinned
meats
of
chicago
with
a
pinch
of
our
modern
substitute
for
salt
they
carried
him
into
the
of
a
great
hotel
in
that
close
atmosphere
death
breathed
more
freely
and
there
they
gave
him
their
cheap
indian
tea
they
brought
him
a
bottle
of
wine
that
they
called
champagne
death
drank
it
up
they
brought
a
newspaper
and
looked
up
the
patent
medicines
they
gave
him
the
foods
that
it
recommended
for
invalids
and
a
little
medicine
as
prescribed
in
the
paper
they
gave
him
some
milk
and
borax
such
as
children
drink
in
england
death
arose
ravening
strong
and
strode
again
through
the
cities
the
lonely
idol
i
had
from
a
friend
an
old
outlandish
stone
a
little
idol
to
whom
no
one
prayed
and
when
i
saw
his
melancholy
case
as
he
sat
at
receipt
of
prayer
holding
a
little
scourge
that
the
years
had
broken
and
no
one
heeded
the
scourge
and
no
one
prayed
and
no
one
came
with
squealing
sacrifice
and
he
had
been
a
god
then
i
took
pity
on
the
little
forgotten
thing
and
prayed
to
it
as
perhaps
they
prayed
long
since
before
the
coming
of
the
strange
dark
ships
and
humbled
myself
and
said
o
idol
idol
of
the
hard
pale
stone
invincible
to
the
years
o
give
ear
for
behold
i
pray
o
little
image
whose
wanderings
are
from
far
know
thou
that
here
in
europe
and
in
other
lands
near
by
too
soon
there
pass
from
us
the
sweets
and
song
and
the
lion
strength
of
youth
too
soon
do
their
cheeks
fade
their
hair
grow
grey
and
our
beloved
die
too
brittle
is
beauty
too
far
off
is
fame
and
the
years
are
gathered
too
soon
there
are
leaves
leaves
falling
everywhere
falling
there
is
autumn
among
men
autumn
and
reaping
failure
there
is
struggle
dying
and
weeping
and
all
that
is
beautiful
hath
not
remained
but
is
even
as
the
glory
of
morning
upon
the
water
even
our
memories
are
gathered
too
with
the
sound
of
the
ancient
voices
the
pleasant
ancient
voices
that
come
to
our
ears
no
more
the
very
gardens
of
our
childhood
fade
and
there
dims
with
the
speed
of
the
years
even
the
mind
own
eye
o
be
not
any
more
the
friend
of
time
for
the
silent
hurry
of
his
malevolent
feet
have
trodden
down
what
fairest
i
almost
hear
the
whimper
of
the
years
running
behind
him
and
it
takes
few
to
tear
us
all
that
is
beautiful
he
crushes
down
as
a
big
man
tramples
daises
all
that
is
fairest
how
very
fair
are
the
little
children
of
men
it
is
autumn
with
all
the
world
and
the
stars
weep
to
see
it
therefore
no
longer
be
the
friend
of
time
who
will
not
let
us
be
and
be
not
good
to
him
but
pity
us
and
let
lovely
things
live
on
for
the
sake
of
our
tears
thus
prayed
i
out
of
compassion
one
windy
day
to
the
idol
to
whom
no
one
kneeled
the
sphinx
in
thebes
massachusetts
there
was
a
woman
in
a
city
who
had
all
that
money
could
buy
she
had
gold
and
dividends
and
trains
and
houses
and
she
had
pets
to
play
with
but
she
had
no
sphinx
so
she
besought
them
to
bring
her
a
live
sphinx
and
therefore
they
went
to
the
menageries
and
then
to
the
forests
and
the
desert
places
and
yet
could
find
no
sphinx
and
she
would
have
been
content
with
a
little
lion
but
that
one
was
already
owned
by
a
woman
she
knew
so
they
had
to
search
the
world
again
for
a
sphinx
and
still
there
was
none
but
they
were
not
men
that
it
is
easy
to
baffle
and
at
last
they
found
a
sphinx
in
a
desert
at
evening
watching
a
ruined
temple
whose
gods
she
had
eaten
hundreds
of
years
ago
when
her
hunger
was
on
her
and
they
cast
chains
on
her
who
was
still
with
an
ominous
stillness
and
took
her
westwards
with
them
and
brought
her
home
and
so
the
sphinx
came
to
the
city
and
the
woman
was
very
glad
that
she
owned
a
sphinx
but
the
sphinx
stared
long
into
her
eyes
one
day
and
softly
asked
a
riddle
of
the
woman
and
the
woman
could
not
answer
and
she
died
and
the
sphinx
is
silent
again
and
none
knows
what
she
will
do
the
reward
one
spirit
goes
further
in
dreams
than
it
does
by
day
wandering
once
by
night
from
a
factory
city
i
came
to
the
edge
of
hell
the
place
was
foul
with
cinders
and
things
and
jagged
things
with
shapeless
edges
and
there
was
a
huge
angel
with
a
hammer
building
in
plaster
and
steel
i
wondered
what
he
did
in
that
dreadful
place
i
hesitated
then
asked
him
what
he
was
building
we
are
adding
to
hell
he
said
to
keep
pace
with
the
times
do
be
too
hard
on
them
i
said
for
i
had
just
come
out
of
a
compromising
age
and
a
weakening
country
the
angel
did
not
answer
it
wo
be
as
bad
as
the
old
hell
will
it
i
said
worse
said
the
angel
how
can
you
reconcile
it
with
your
conscience
as
a
minister
of
grace
i
said
to
inflict
such
a
punishment
they
talked
like
this
in
the
city
whence
i
had
come
and
i
could
not
avoid
the
habit
of
it
they
have
invented
a
new
cheap
yeast
said
the
angel
i
looked
at
the
legend
on
the
walls
of
the
hell
that
the
angel
was
building
the
words
were
written
in
flame
every
fifteen
seconds
they
changed
their
color
yeasto
the
great
new
yeast
it
builds
up
body
and
brain
and
something
more
they
shall
look
at
it
for
ever
the
angel
said
but
they
drove
a
perfectly
legitimate
trade
i
said
the
law
allowed
it
the
angel
went
on
hammering
into
place
the
huge
steel
uprights
you
are
very
revengeful
i
said
do
you
never
rest
from
doing
this
terrible
work
i
rested
one
christmas
day
the
angel
said
and
looked
and
saw
little
children
dying
of
cancer
i
shall
go
on
now
until
the
fires
are
lit
it
is
very
hard
to
prove
i
said
that
the
yeast
is
as
bad
as
you
think
after
all
i
said
they
must
live
and
the
angel
made
no
answer
but
went
on
building
his
hell
the
trouble
in
leafy
green
street
she
went
to
the
in
moleshill
street
where
the
old
man
mumbles
and
said
i
want
a
god
to
worship
when
it
is
wet
the
old
man
reminded
her
of
the
heavy
penalties
that
rightly
attach
to
idolatry
and
when
he
had
enumerated
all
she
answered
him
as
was
meet
give
me
a
god
to
worship
when
it
is
wet
and
he
went
to
the
back
places
of
his
shop
and
sought
out
and
brought
her
a
god
the
same
was
carved
of
grey
stone
and
wore
a
propitious
look
and
was
named
as
the
old
man
mumbled
the
god
of
rainy
cheerfulness
now
it
may
be
that
long
confinement
to
the
house
affects
adversely
the
liver
or
these
things
may
be
of
the
soul
but
certain
it
is
that
on
a
rainy
day
her
spirits
so
far
descended
that
those
cheerful
creatures
came
within
sight
of
the
pit
and
having
tried
cigarettes
to
no
good
end
she
bethought
her
of
moleshill
street
and
the
mumbling
man
he
brought
the
grey
idol
forth
and
mumbled
of
guarantees
although
he
put
nothing
on
paper
and
she
paid
him
there
and
then
his
preposterous
price
and
took
the
idol
away
and
on
the
next
wet
day
that
there
ever
was
she
prayed
to
the
idol
that
she
had
bought
the
god
of
rainy
cheerfulness
who
knows
with
what
ceremony
or
what
lack
of
it
and
so
brought
down
on
her
in
leafy
green
street
in
the
preposterous
house
at
the
corner
that
doom
of
which
all
men
speak
the
mist
the
mist
said
unto
the
mist
let
us
go
up
into
the
downs
and
the
mist
came
up
weeping
and
the
mist
went
into
the
high
places
and
the
hollows
and
clumps
of
trees
in
the
distance
stood
ghostly
in
the
haze
but
i
went
to
a
prophet
one
who
loved
the
downs
and
i
said
to
him
why
does
the
mist
come
up
weeping
into
the
downs
when
it
goes
into
the
high
places
and
the
hollows
and
he
answered
the
mist
is
the
company
of
a
multitude
of
souls
who
never
saw
the
downs
and
now
are
dead
therefore
they
come
up
weeping
into
the
downs
who
are
dead
and
never
saw
them
he
was
all
in
black
but
his
friend
was
dressed
in
brown
members
of
two
old
families
is
there
any
change
in
the
way
you
build
your
houses
said
he
in
black
no
change
said
the
other
and
you
we
change
not
he
said
a
man
went
by
in
the
distance
riding
a
bicycle
he
is
always
changing
said
the
one
in
black
of
late
almost
every
century
he
is
uneasy
always
changing
he
changes
the
way
he
builds
his
house
does
he
not
said
the
brown
one
so
my
family
say
said
the
other
they
say
he
has
changed
of
late
they
say
he
takes
much
to
cities
the
brown
one
said
my
cousin
who
lives
in
belfries
tells
me
so
said
the
black
one
he
says
he
is
much
in
cities
and
there
he
grows
lean
said
the
brown
one
yes
he
grows
lean
is
it
true
what
they
say
said
the
brown
one
caw
said
the
black
one
is
it
true
that
he
can
not
live
many
centuries
no
no
said
the
black
one
will
not
die
we
must
not
lose
he
has
been
foolish
of
late
he
has
played
with
smoke
and
is
sick
his
engines
have
wearied
him
and
his
cities
are
evil
yes
he
is
very
sick
but
in
a
few
centuries
he
will
forget
his
folly
and
we
shall
not
lose
time
out
of
mind
he
has
delved
and
my
family
have
got
their
food
from
the
raw
earth
behind
him
he
will
not
die
but
they
say
do
they
not
said
the
brown
one
his
cities
are
noisome
and
that
he
grows
sick
in
them
and
can
run
no
longer
and
that
it
is
with
him
as
it
is
with
us
when
we
grow
too
many
and
the
grass
has
the
bitter
taste
in
the
rainy
season
and
our
young
grow
bloated
and
die
who
says
it
replied
the
black
one
pigeon
the
brown
one
answered
he
came
back
all
dirty
and
hare
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
cities
once
he
says
it
too
man
was
too
sick
to
chase
him
he
thinks
that
man
will
die
and
his
wicked
friend
dog
with
him
dog
he
will
die
that
nasty
fellow
dog
he
will
die
too
the
dirty
fellow
pigeon
and
hare
said
the
black
one
we
shall
not
lose
who
told
you
he
will
not
die
his
brown
friend
said
who
told
me
the
black
one
said
my
family
and
his
have
understood
each
other
times
out
of
mind
we
know
what
follies
will
kill
each
other
and
what
each
may
survive
and
i
say
that
will
not
die
he
will
die
said
the
brown
one
caw
said
the
other
and
man
said
in
his
heart
just
one
invention
more
there
is
something
i
want
to
do
with
petrol
yet
and
then
i
will
give
it
all
up
and
go
back
to
the
woods
lobster
salad
i
was
climbing
round
the
perilous
outside
of
the
palace
of
colquonhombros
so
far
below
me
that
in
the
tranquil
twilight
and
clear
air
of
those
lands
i
could
only
barely
see
them
lay
the
craggy
tops
of
the
mountains
it
was
along
no
battlements
or
terrace
edge
i
was
climbing
but
on
the
sheer
face
of
the
wall
itself
getting
what
foothold
i
could
where
the
boulders
joined
had
my
feet
been
bare
i
was
done
but
though
i
was
in
my
i
had
on
stout
leather
boots
and
their
edges
somehow
held
in
those
narrow
cracks
my
fingers
and
wrists
were
aching
had
it
been
possible
to
stop
for
a
moment
i
might
have
been
lured
to
give
a
second
look
at
the
fearful
peaks
of
the
mountains
down
there
in
the
twilight
and
this
must
have
been
fatal
that
the
thing
was
all
a
dream
is
beside
the
point
we
have
fallen
in
dreams
before
but
it
is
well
known
that
if
in
one
of
those
falls
you
ever
hit
the
ground
you
die
i
had
looked
at
those
menacing
mountaintops
and
knew
well
that
such
a
fall
as
the
one
i
feared
must
have
such
a
termination
then
i
went
on
it
is
strange
what
different
sensations
there
can
be
in
different
boulders
every
one
gleaming
with
the
same
white
light
and
every
one
chosen
to
match
the
rest
by
minions
of
ancient
kings
when
your
life
depends
on
the
edges
of
every
one
you
come
to
those
edges
seemed
strangely
different
it
was
of
no
avail
to
overcome
the
terror
of
one
for
the
next
would
give
you
a
hold
in
quite
a
different
way
or
hand
you
over
to
death
in
a
different
manner
some
were
too
sharp
to
hold
and
some
too
flush
with
the
wall
those
whose
hold
was
the
best
crumbled
the
soonest
each
rock
had
its
different
terror
and
then
there
were
those
things
that
followed
behind
me
and
at
last
i
came
to
a
breach
made
long
ago
by
earthquake
lightning
or
war
i
should
have
had
to
go
down
a
thousand
feet
to
get
round
it
and
they
would
come
up
with
me
while
i
was
doing
that
for
certain
sable
apes
that
i
have
not
mentioned
as
yet
things
that
had
tigerish
teeth
and
were
born
and
bred
on
that
wall
had
pursued
me
all
the
evening
in
any
case
i
could
have
gone
no
farther
nor
did
i
know
what
the
king
would
do
along
whose
wall
i
was
climbing
it
was
time
to
drop
and
be
done
with
it
or
stop
and
await
those
apes
and
then
it
was
that
i
remembered
a
pin
thrown
carelessly
down
out
of
an
in
another
world
to
the
one
where
grew
that
glittering
wall
and
lying
now
if
no
evil
chance
had
removed
it
on
a
chest
of
drawers
by
my
bed
the
apes
were
very
close
and
hurrying
for
they
knew
my
fingers
were
slipping
and
the
cruel
peaks
of
those
infernal
mountains
seemed
surer
of
me
than
the
apes
i
reached
out
with
a
desperate
effort
of
will
towards
where
the
pin
lay
on
the
chest
of
drawers
i
groped
about
i
found
it
i
ran
it
into
my
arm
saved
the
return
of
the
exiles
the
old
man
with
a
hammer
and
the
man
with
a
spear
were
seated
by
the
roadside
talking
as
i
came
up
the
hill
it
is
as
though
they
had
asked
us
the
one
with
the
hammer
said
there
ai
no
more
than
twenty
as
knows
about
it
said
the
other
twenty
twenty
said
the
first
after
all
these
years
said
the
man
with
the
spear
after
all
these
years
we
might
go
back
just
once
o
course
we
might
said
the
other
their
clothes
were
old
even
for
laborers
the
one
with
the
hammer
had
a
leather
apron
full
of
holes
and
blackened
and
their
hands
looked
like
leather
but
whatever
they
were
they
were
english
and
this
was
pleasant
to
see
after
all
the
motors
that
had
passed
me
that
day
with
their
burden
of
mixed
and
doubtful
nationalities
when
they
saw
me
the
one
with
the
hammer
touched
his
greasy
cap
might
we
make
so
bold
sir
he
said
as
the
ask
the
way
to
stonehenge
we
never
ought
to
go
mumbled
the
other
plaintively
not
more
than
twenty
as
knows
but
i
was
bicycling
there
myself
to
see
the
place
so
i
pointed
out
the
way
and
rode
on
at
once
for
there
was
something
so
utterly
servile
about
them
both
that
i
did
not
care
for
their
company
they
seemed
by
their
wretched
mien
to
have
been
persecuted
or
utterly
neglected
for
many
years
i
thought
that
very
likely
they
had
done
long
terms
of
penal
servitude
when
i
came
to
stonehenge
i
saw
a
group
of
about
a
score
of
men
standing
among
the
stones
they
asked
me
with
some
solemnity
if
i
was
expecting
anyone
and
when
i
said
no
they
spoke
to
me
no
more
it
was
three
miles
back
where
i
left
those
strange
old
men
but
i
had
not
been
in
the
stone
circle
long
when
they
appeared
coming
with
great
strides
along
the
road
when
they
saw
them
all
the
people
took
off
their
hats
and
acted
very
strangely
and
i
saw
that
they
had
a
goat
which
they
led
up
then
to
the
old
altar
stone
and
the
two
old
men
came
up
with
their
hammer
and
spear
and
began
apologizing
plaintively
for
the
liberty
they
had
taken
in
coming
back
to
that
place
and
all
the
people
knelt
on
the
grass
before
them
and
then
still
kneeling
they
killed
the
goat
by
the
altar
and
when
the
two
old
men
saw
this
they
came
up
with
many
excuses
and
eagerly
sniffed
the
blood
and
at
first
this
made
them
happy
but
soon
the
one
with
the
spear
began
to
whimper
it
used
to
be
men
he
lamented
it
used
to
be
men
and
the
twenty
men
began
looking
uneasily
at
each
other
and
the
plaint
of
the
man
went
on
in
that
tearful
voice
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
all
looked
at
me
i
do
not
know
who
the
two
old
men
were
or
what
any
of
them
were
doing
but
there
are
moments
when
it
is
clearly
time
to
go
and
i
left
them
there
and
then
and
just
as
i
got
up
on
to
my
bicycle
i
heard
the
plaintive
voice
of
the
one
with
the
hammer
apologizing
for
the
liberty
he
had
taken
in
coming
back
to
stonehenge
but
after
all
these
years
i
heard
him
crying
after
all
these
years
and
the
one
with
the
spear
said
yes
after
three
thousand
years
nature
and
time
through
the
streets
of
coventry
one
winter
night
strode
a
triumphant
spirit
behind
him
stooping
unkempt
utterly
ragged
wearing
the
clothes
and
look
that
outcasts
have
whining
weeping
reproaching
an
spirit
tried
to
keep
pace
with
him
continually
she
plucked
him
by
the
sleeve
and
cried
out
to
him
as
she
panted
after
and
he
strode
resolute
on
it
was
a
bitter
night
yet
it
did
not
seem
to
be
the
cold
that
she
feared
though
she
was
but
the
trams
and
the
ugly
shops
and
the
glare
of
the
factories
from
which
she
continually
winced
as
she
hobbled
on
and
the
pavement
hurt
her
feet
he
that
strode
on
in
front
seemed
to
care
for
nothing
it
might
be
hot
or
cold
silent
or
noisy
pavement
or
open
fields
he
merely
had
the
air
of
striding
on
and
she
caught
up
and
clutched
him
by
the
elbow
i
heard
her
speak
in
her
unhappy
voice
you
scarcely
heard
it
for
the
noise
of
the
traffic
you
have
forgotten
me
she
complained
to
him
you
have
forsaken
me
here
she
pointed
to
coventry
with
a
wide
wave
of
her
arm
and
seemed
to
indicate
other
cities
beyond
and
he
gruffly
told
her
to
keep
pace
with
him
and
that
he
did
not
forsake
her
and
she
went
on
with
her
pitiful
lamentation
my
anemones
are
dead
for
miles
she
said
all
my
woods
are
fallen
and
still
the
cities
grow
my
child
man
is
unhappy
and
my
other
children
are
dying
and
still
the
cities
grow
and
you
have
forgotten
me
and
then
he
turned
angrily
on
her
almost
stopping
in
that
stride
of
his
that
began
when
the
stars
were
made
when
have
i
ever
forgotten
you
he
said
or
when
forsaken
you
ever
did
i
not
throw
down
babylon
for
you
and
is
not
nineveh
gone
where
is
persepolis
that
troubled
you
where
tarshish
and
tyre
and
you
have
said
i
forget
you
and
at
this
she
seemed
to
take
a
little
comfort
i
heard
her
speak
once
more
looking
wistfully
at
her
companion
when
will
the
fields
come
back
and
the
grass
for
my
children
soon
soon
he
said
then
they
were
silent
and
he
strode
away
she
limping
along
behind
him
and
all
the
clocks
in
the
towers
chimed
as
he
passed
the
song
of
the
blackbird
as
the
poet
passed
the
the
blackbird
sang
how
ever
do
you
do
it
the
poet
said
for
he
knew
bird
language
it
was
like
this
said
the
blackbird
it
really
was
the
most
extraordinary
thing
i
made
that
song
last
spring
it
came
to
me
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
the
most
beautiful
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
her
eyes
were
blacker
than
lakes
are
at
night
her
feathers
were
blacker
than
the
night
itself
and
nothing
was
as
yellow
as
her
beak
she
could
fly
much
faster
than
the
lightning
she
was
not
an
ordinary
there
has
never
been
any
other
like
her
at
all
i
did
not
dare
go
near
her
because
she
was
so
wonderful
one
day
last
spring
when
it
got
warm
again
it
had
been
cold
we
ate
berries
things
were
quite
different
then
but
spring
came
and
it
got
warm
one
day
i
was
thinking
how
wonderful
she
was
and
it
seemed
so
extraordinary
to
think
that
i
should
ever
have
seen
her
the
only
really
wonderful
in
the
world
that
i
opened
my
beak
to
give
a
shout
and
then
this
song
came
and
there
had
never
been
anything
like
it
before
and
luckily
i
remembered
it
the
very
song
that
i
sang
just
now
but
what
is
so
extraordinary
the
most
amazing
occurence
of
that
marvellous
day
was
that
no
sooner
had
i
sung
the
song
than
that
very
bird
the
most
wonderful
in
the
world
flew
right
up
to
me
and
sat
quite
close
to
me
on
the
same
tree
i
never
remember
such
wonderful
times
as
those
yes
the
song
came
in
a
moment
and
as
i
was
saying
and
an
old
wanderer
walking
with
a
stick
came
by
and
the
blackbird
flew
away
and
the
poet
told
the
old
man
the
blackbird
wonderful
story
that
song
new
said
the
wanderer
not
a
bit
of
it
god
made
it
years
ago
all
the
blackbirds
used
to
sing
it
when
i
was
young
it
was
new
then
the
messengers
one
wandering
nigh
parnassus
chasing
hares
heard
the
high
muses
take
us
a
message
to
the
golden
town
thus
sang
the
muses
but
the
man
said
they
do
not
call
to
me
not
to
such
as
me
speak
the
muses
and
the
muses
called
him
by
name
take
us
a
message
they
said
to
the
golden
town
and
the
man
was
downcast
for
he
would
have
chased
hares
and
the
muses
called
again
and
when
whether
in
valleys
or
on
high
crags
of
the
hills
he
still
heard
the
muses
he
went
at
last
to
them
and
heard
their
message
though
he
would
fain
have
left
it
to
other
men
and
chased
the
fleet
hares
still
in
happy
valleys
and
they
gave
him
a
wreath
of
laurels
carved
out
of
emeralds
as
only
the
muses
can
carve
by
this
they
said
they
shall
know
that
you
come
from
the
muses
and
the
man
went
from
that
place
and
dressed
in
scarlet
silks
as
befitted
one
that
came
from
the
high
muses
and
through
the
gateway
of
the
golden
town
he
ran
and
cried
his
message
and
his
cloak
floated
behind
him
all
silent
sat
the
wise
men
and
the
aged
they
of
the
golden
town
they
sat
before
their
houses
reading
from
parchments
a
message
of
the
muses
that
they
sent
long
before
and
the
young
man
cried
his
message
from
the
muses
and
they
rose
up
and
said
thou
art
not
from
the
muses
otherwise
spake
they
and
they
stoned
him
and
he
died
and
afterwards
they
carved
his
message
upon
gold
and
read
it
in
their
temples
on
holy
days
when
will
the
muses
rest
when
are
they
weary
they
sent
another
messenger
to
the
golden
town
and
they
gave
him
a
wand
of
ivory
to
carry
in
his
hand
with
all
the
beautiful
stories
of
the
world
wondrously
carved
thereon
and
only
the
muses
could
have
carved
it
by
this
they
said
they
shall
know
that
you
come
from
the
muses
and
he
came
through
the
gateway
of
the
golden
town
with
the
message
he
had
for
its
people
and
they
rose
up
at
once
in
the
golden
street
they
rose
from
reading
the
message
that
they
had
carved
upon
gold
the
last
who
came
they
said
came
with
a
wreath
of
laurels
carved
out
of
emeralds
as
only
the
muses
can
carve
you
are
not
from
the
muses
and
even
as
they
had
stoned
the
last
so
also
they
stoned
him
and
afterwards
they
carved
his
message
on
gold
and
laid
it
up
in
their
temples
when
will
the
muses
rest
when
are
they
weary
even
yet
once
again
they
sent
a
messenger
under
the
gateway
into
the
golden
town
and
for
all
that
he
wore
a
garland
of
gold
that
the
high
muses
gave
him
a
garland
of
kingcups
soft
and
yellow
on
his
head
yet
fashioned
of
pure
gold
and
by
whom
but
the
muses
yet
did
they
stone
him
in
the
golden
town
but
they
had
the
message
and
what
care
the
muses
and
yet
they
will
not
rest
for
some
while
since
i
heard
them
call
to
me
go
take
our
message
they
said
unto
the
golden
town
but
i
would
not
go
and
they
spake
a
second
time
go
take
our
message
they
said
and
still
i
would
not
go
and
they
cried
out
a
third
time
go
take
our
message
and
though
they
cried
a
third
time
i
would
not
go
but
morning
and
night
they
cried
and
through
long
evenings
when
will
the
muses
rest
when
are
they
weary
and
when
they
would
not
cease
to
call
to
me
i
went
to
them
and
i
said
the
golden
town
is
the
golden
town
no
longer
they
have
sold
their
pillars
for
brass
and
their
temples
for
money
they
have
made
coins
out
of
their
golden
doors
it
is
become
a
dark
town
full
of
trouble
there
is
no
ease
in
its
streets
beauty
has
left
it
and
the
old
songs
are
gone
go
take
our
message
they
cried
and
i
said
to
the
high
muses
you
do
not
understand
you
have
no
message
for
the
golden
town
the
holy
city
no
longer
go
take
our
message
they
cried
what
is
your
message
i
said
to
the
high
muses
and
when
i
heard
their
message
i
made
excuses
dreading
to
speak
such
things
in
the
golden
town
and
again
they
bade
me
go
and
i
said
i
will
not
go
none
will
believe
me
and
still
the
muses
cry
to
me
all
night
long
they
do
not
understand
how
should
they
know
the
three
tall
sons
and
at
last
man
raised
on
high
the
final
glory
of
his
civilization
the
towering
edifice
of
the
ultimate
city
softly
beneath
him
in
the
deeps
of
the
earth
purred
his
machinery
fulfilling
all
his
needs
there
was
no
more
toil
for
man
there
he
sat
at
ease
discussing
the
sex
problem
and
sometimes
painfully
out
of
forgotten
fields
there
came
to
his
outer
door
came
to
the
furthest
rampart
of
the
final
glory
of
man
a
poor
old
woman
begging
and
always
they
turned
her
away
this
glory
of
man
achievement
this
city
was
not
for
her
it
was
nature
that
came
thus
begging
in
from
the
fields
whom
they
always
turned
away
and
away
she
went
again
alone
to
her
fields
and
one
day
she
came
again
and
again
they
sent
her
hence
but
her
three
tall
sons
came
too
these
shall
go
in
she
said
even
these
my
sons
to
your
city
and
the
three
tall
sons
went
in
and
these
are
nature
sons
the
forlorn
one
terrible
children
war
famine
and
plague
yea
and
they
went
in
there
and
found
man
unawares
in
his
city
still
poring
over
his
problems
obsessed
with
his
civilization
and
never
hearing
their
tread
as
those
three
came
up
behind
compromise
they
built
their
gorgeous
home
their
city
of
glory
above
the
lair
of
the
earthquake
they
built
it
of
marble
and
gold
in
the
shining
youth
of
the
world
there
they
feasted
and
fought
and
called
their
city
immortal
and
danced
and
sang
songs
to
the
gods
none
heeded
the
earthquake
in
all
those
joyous
streets
and
down
in
the
deeps
of
the
earth
on
the
black
feet
of
the
abyss
they
that
would
conquer
man
mumbled
long
in
the
darkness
mumbled
and
goaded
the
earthquake
to
try
his
strength
with
that
city
to
go
forth
blithely
at
night
and
to
gnaw
its
pillars
like
bones
and
down
in
those
grimy
deeps
the
earthquake
answered
them
and
would
not
do
their
pleasure
and
would
not
stir
from
thence
for
who
knew
who
they
were
who
danced
all
day
where
he
rumbled
and
what
if
the
lords
of
that
city
that
had
no
fear
of
his
anger
were
haply
even
the
gods
and
the
centuries
plodded
by
on
and
on
round
the
world
and
one
day
they
that
had
danced
they
that
had
sung
in
that
city
remembered
the
lair
of
the
earthquake
in
the
deeps
down
under
their
feet
and
made
plans
one
with
another
and
sought
to
avert
the
danger
sought
to
appease
the
earthquake
and
turn
his
anger
away
they
sent
down
singing
girls
and
priests
with
oats
and
wine
they
sent
down
garlands
and
propitious
berries
down
by
dark
steps
to
the
black
depths
of
the
earth
they
sent
peacocks
newly
slain
and
boys
with
burning
spices
and
their
thin
white
sacred
cats
with
collars
of
pearls
all
newly
drawn
from
sea
they
sent
huge
diamonds
down
in
coffers
of
teak
and
ointment
and
strange
oriental
dyes
arrows
and
armor
and
the
rings
of
their
queen
oho
said
the
earthquake
in
the
coolth
of
the
earth
so
they
are
not
the
gods
what
we
have
come
to
when
the
advertiser
saw
the
cathedral
spires
over
the
downs
in
the
distance
he
looked
at
them
and
wept
if
only
he
said
this
were
an
advertisement
of
beefo
so
nice
so
nutritious
try
it
in
your
soup
ladies
like
it
the
tomb
of
pan
seeing
they
said
that
pan
is
dead
let
us
now
make
a
tomb
for
him
and
a
monument
that
the
dreadful
worship
of
long
ago
may
be
remembered
and
avoided
by
all
so
said
the
people
of
the
enlightened
lands
and
they
built
a
white
and
mighty
tomb
of
marble
slowly
it
rose
under
the
hands
of
the
builders
and
longer
every
evening
after
sunset
it
gleamed
with
rays
of
the
departed
sun
and
many
mourned
for
pan
while
the
builders
built
many
reviled
him
some
called
the
builders
to
cease
and
to
weep
for
pan
and
others
called
them
to
leave
no
memorial
at
all
of
so
infamous
a
god
but
the
builders
built
on
steadily
and
one
day
all
was
finished
and
the
tomb
stood
there
like
a
steep
and
pan
was
carved
thereon
with
humbled
head
and
the
feet
of
angels
pressed
upon
his
neck
and
when
the
tomb
was
finished
the
sun
had
already
set
but
the
afterglow
was
rosy
on
the
huge
bulk
of
pan
and
presently
all
the
enlightened
people
came
and
saw
the
tomb
and
remembered
pan
who
was
dead
and
all
deplored
him
and
his
wicked
age
but
a
few
wept
apart
because
of
the
death
of
pan
but
at
evening
as
he
stole
out
of
the
forest
and
slipped
like
a
shadow
softly
along
the
hills
pan
saw
the
tomb
and
laughed
