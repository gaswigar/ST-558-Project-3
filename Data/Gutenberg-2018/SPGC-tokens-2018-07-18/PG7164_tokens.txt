introduction
a
few
days
ago
i
said
to
a
distinguished
bengali
doctor
of
medicine
know
no
german
yet
if
a
translation
of
a
german
poet
had
moved
me
i
would
go
to
the
british
museum
and
find
books
in
english
that
would
tell
me
something
of
his
life
and
of
the
history
of
his
thought
but
though
these
prose
translations
from
rabindranath
tagore
have
stirred
my
blood
as
nothing
has
for
years
i
shall
not
know
anything
of
his
life
and
of
the
movements
of
thought
that
have
made
them
possible
if
some
indian
traveller
will
not
tell
me
it
seemed
to
him
natural
that
i
should
be
moved
for
he
said
read
rabindranath
every
day
to
read
one
line
of
his
is
to
forget
all
the
troubles
of
the
world
i
said
englishman
living
in
london
in
the
reign
of
richard
the
second
had
he
been
shown
translations
from
petrarch
or
from
dante
would
have
found
no
books
to
answer
his
questions
but
would
have
questioned
some
florentine
banker
or
lombard
merchant
as
i
question
you
for
all
i
know
so
abundant
and
simple
is
this
poetry
the
new
renaissance
has
been
born
in
your
country
and
i
shall
never
know
of
it
except
by
hearsay
he
answered
have
other
poets
but
none
that
are
his
equal
we
call
this
the
epoch
of
rabindranath
no
poet
seems
to
me
as
famous
in
europe
as
he
is
among
us
he
is
as
great
in
music
as
in
poetry
and
his
songs
are
sung
from
the
west
of
india
into
burma
wherever
bengali
is
spoken
he
was
already
famous
at
nineteen
when
he
wrote
his
first
novel
and
plays
when
he
was
but
little
older
are
still
played
in
calcutta
i
so
much
admire
the
completeness
of
his
life
when
he
was
very
young
he
wrote
much
of
natural
objects
he
would
sit
all
day
in
his
garden
from
his
year
or
so
to
his
perhaps
when
he
had
a
great
sorrow
he
wrote
the
most
beautiful
love
poetry
in
our
language
and
then
he
said
with
deep
emotion
can
never
express
what
i
owed
at
seventeen
to
his
love
poetry
after
that
his
art
grew
deeper
it
became
religious
and
philosophical
all
the
inspiration
of
mankind
are
in
his
hymns
he
is
the
first
among
our
saints
who
has
not
refused
to
live
but
has
spoken
out
of
life
itself
and
that
is
why
we
give
him
our
love
i
may
have
changed
his
words
in
my
memory
but
not
his
thought
little
while
ago
he
was
to
read
divine
service
in
one
of
our
churches
we
of
the
brahma
samaj
use
your
word
in
english
it
was
the
largest
in
calcutta
and
not
only
was
it
crowded
but
the
streets
were
all
but
impassable
because
of
the
people
other
indians
came
to
see
me
and
their
reverence
for
this
man
sounded
strange
in
our
world
where
we
hide
great
and
little
things
under
the
same
veil
of
obvious
comedy
and
depreciation
when
we
were
making
the
cathedrals
had
we
a
like
reverence
for
our
great
men
morning
at
three
i
know
for
i
have
seen
it
one
said
to
me
sits
immovable
in
contemplation
and
for
two
hours
does
not
awake
from
his
reverie
upon
the
nature
of
god
his
father
the
maha
rishi
would
sometimes
sit
there
all
through
the
next
day
once
upon
a
river
he
fell
into
contemplation
because
of
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
and
the
rowers
waited
for
eight
hours
before
they
could
continue
their
journey
he
then
told
me
of
family
and
how
for
generations
great
men
have
come
out
of
its
cradles
he
said
are
gogonendranath
and
abanindranath
tagore
who
are
artists
and
dwijendranath
rabindranath
brother
who
is
a
great
philosopher
the
squirrels
come
from
the
boughs
and
climb
on
to
his
knees
and
the
birds
alight
upon
his
hands
i
notice
in
these
men
thought
a
sense
of
visible
beauty
and
meaning
as
though
they
held
that
doctrine
of
nietzsche
that
we
must
not
believe
in
the
moral
or
intellectual
beauty
which
does
not
sooner
or
later
impress
itself
upon
physical
things
i
said
the
east
you
know
how
to
keep
a
family
illustrious
the
other
day
the
curator
of
a
museum
pointed
out
to
me
a
little
man
who
was
arranging
their
chinese
prints
and
said
is
the
hereditary
connoisseur
of
the
mikado
he
is
the
fourteenth
of
his
family
to
hold
the
post
answered
rabindranath
was
a
boy
he
had
all
round
him
in
his
home
literature
and
music
i
thought
of
the
abundance
of
the
simplicity
of
the
poems
and
said
your
country
is
there
much
propagandist
writing
much
criticism
we
have
to
do
so
much
especially
in
my
own
country
that
our
minds
gradually
cease
to
be
creative
and
yet
we
can
not
help
it
if
our
life
was
not
a
continual
warfare
we
would
not
have
taste
we
would
not
know
what
is
good
we
would
not
find
hearers
and
readers
of
our
energy
is
spent
in
the
quarrel
with
bad
taste
whether
in
our
own
minds
or
in
the
minds
of
others
understand
he
replied
too
have
our
propagandist
writing
in
the
villages
they
recite
long
mythological
poems
adapted
from
the
sanskrit
in
the
middle
ages
and
they
often
insert
passages
telling
the
people
that
they
must
do
their
duties
i
have
carried
the
manuscript
of
these
translations
about
with
me
for
days
reading
it
in
railway
trains
or
on
the
top
of
omnibuses
and
in
restaurants
and
i
have
often
had
to
close
it
lest
some
stranger
would
see
how
much
it
moved
me
these
lyrics
which
are
in
the
original
my
indians
tell
me
full
of
subtlety
of
rhythm
of
untranslatable
delicacies
of
colour
of
metrical
invention
display
in
their
thought
a
world
i
have
dreamed
of
all
my
live
long
the
work
of
a
supreme
culture
they
yet
appear
as
much
the
growth
of
the
common
soil
as
the
grass
and
the
rushes
a
tradition
where
poetry
and
religion
are
the
same
thing
has
passed
through
the
centuries
gathering
from
learned
and
unlearned
metaphor
and
emotion
and
carried
back
again
to
the
multitude
the
thought
of
the
scholar
and
of
the
noble
if
the
civilization
of
bengal
remains
unbroken
if
that
common
mind
which
as
one
divines
runs
through
all
is
not
as
with
us
broken
into
a
dozen
minds
that
know
nothing
of
each
other
something
even
of
what
is
most
subtle
in
these
verses
will
have
come
in
a
few
generations
to
the
beggar
on
the
roads
when
there
was
but
one
mind
in
england
chaucer
wrote
his
and
and
thought
he
had
written
to
be
read
or
to
be
read
out
for
our
time
was
coming
on
apace
he
was
sung
by
minstrels
for
a
while
rabindranath
tagore
like
forerunners
writes
music
for
his
words
and
one
understands
at
every
moment
that
he
is
so
abundant
so
spontaneous
so
daring
in
his
passion
so
full
of
surprise
because
he
is
doing
something
which
has
never
seemed
strange
unnatural
or
in
need
of
defence
these
verses
will
not
lie
in
little
books
upon
ladies
tables
who
turn
the
pages
with
indolent
hands
that
they
may
sigh
over
a
life
without
meaning
which
is
yet
all
they
can
know
of
life
or
be
carried
by
students
at
the
university
to
be
laid
aside
when
the
work
of
life
begins
but
as
the
generations
pass
travellers
will
hum
them
on
the
highway
and
men
rowing
upon
the
rivers
lovers
while
they
await
one
another
shall
find
in
murmuring
them
this
love
of
god
a
magic
gulf
wherein
their
own
more
bitter
passion
may
bathe
and
renew
its
youth
at
every
moment
the
heart
of
this
poet
flows
outward
to
these
without
derogation
or
condescension
for
it
has
known
that
they
will
understand
and
it
has
filled
itself
with
the
circumstance
of
their
lives
the
traveller
in
the
clothes
that
he
wears
that
dust
may
not
show
upon
him
the
girl
searching
in
her
bed
for
the
petals
fallen
from
the
wreath
of
her
royal
lover
the
servant
or
the
bride
awaiting
the
master
in
the
empty
house
are
images
of
the
heart
turning
to
god
flowers
and
rivers
the
blowing
of
conch
shells
the
heavy
rain
of
the
indian
july
or
the
moods
of
that
heart
in
union
or
in
separation
and
a
man
sitting
in
a
boat
upon
a
river
playing
lute
like
one
of
those
figures
full
of
mysterious
meaning
in
a
chinese
picture
is
god
himself
a
whole
people
a
whole
civilization
immeasurably
strange
to
us
seems
to
have
been
taken
up
into
this
imagination
and
yet
we
are
not
moved
because
of
its
strangeness
but
because
we
have
met
our
own
image
as
though
we
had
walked
in
willow
wood
or
heard
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
literature
our
voice
as
in
a
dream
since
the
renaissance
the
writing
of
european
saints
however
familiar
their
metaphor
and
the
general
structure
of
their
thought
has
ceased
to
hold
our
attention
we
know
that
we
must
at
last
forsake
the
world
and
we
are
accustomed
in
moments
of
weariness
or
exaltation
to
consider
a
voluntary
forsaking
but
how
can
we
who
have
read
so
much
poetry
seen
so
many
paintings
listened
to
so
much
music
where
the
cry
of
the
flesh
and
the
cry
of
the
soul
seems
one
forsake
it
harshly
and
rudely
what
have
we
in
common
with
bernard
covering
his
eyes
that
they
may
not
dwell
upon
the
beauty
of
the
lakes
of
switzerland
or
with
the
violent
rhetoric
of
the
book
of
revelations
we
would
if
we
might
find
as
in
this
book
words
full
of
courtesy
have
got
my
leave
bid
me
farewell
my
brothers
i
bow
to
you
all
and
take
my
departure
here
i
give
back
the
keys
of
my
door
and
i
give
up
all
claims
to
my
house
i
only
ask
for
last
kind
words
from
you
we
were
neighbours
for
long
but
i
received
more
than
i
could
give
now
the
day
has
dawned
and
the
lamp
that
lit
my
dark
corner
is
out
a
summons
has
come
and
i
am
ready
for
my
journey
and
it
is
our
own
mood
when
it
is
furthest
from
kempis
or
john
of
the
cross
that
cries
because
i
love
this
life
i
know
i
shall
love
death
as
well
yet
it
is
not
only
in
our
thoughts
of
the
parting
that
this
book
fathoms
all
we
had
not
known
that
we
loved
god
hardly
it
may
be
that
we
believed
in
him
yet
looking
backward
upon
our
life
we
discover
in
our
exploration
of
the
pathways
of
woods
in
our
delight
in
the
lonely
places
of
hills
in
that
mysterious
claim
that
we
have
made
unavailingly
on
the
woman
that
we
have
loved
the
emotion
that
created
this
insidious
sweetness
my
heart
unbidden
even
as
one
of
the
common
crowd
unknown
to
me
my
king
thou
didst
press
the
signet
of
eternity
upon
many
a
fleeting
moment
this
is
no
longer
the
sanctity
of
the
cell
and
of
the
scourge
being
but
a
lifting
up
as
it
were
into
a
greater
intensity
of
the
mood
of
the
painter
painting
the
dust
and
the
sunlight
and
we
go
for
a
like
voice
to
francis
and
to
william
blake
who
have
seemed
so
alien
in
our
violent
history
we
write
long
books
where
no
page
perhaps
has
any
quality
to
make
writing
a
pleasure
being
confident
in
some
general
design
just
as
we
fight
and
make
money
and
fill
our
heads
with
politics
all
dull
things
in
the
doing
while
tagore
like
the
indian
civilization
itself
has
been
content
to
discover
the
soul
and
surrender
himself
to
its
spontaneity
he
often
seems
to
contrast
life
with
that
of
those
who
have
loved
more
after
our
fashion
and
have
more
seeming
weight
in
the
world
and
always
humbly
as
though
he
were
only
sure
his
way
is
best
for
him
going
home
glance
at
me
and
smile
and
fill
me
with
shame
i
sit
like
a
beggar
maid
drawing
my
skirt
over
my
face
and
when
they
ask
me
what
it
is
i
want
i
drop
my
eyes
and
answer
them
not
at
another
time
remembering
how
his
life
had
once
a
different
shape
he
will
say
an
hour
i
have
spent
in
the
strife
of
the
good
and
the
evil
but
now
it
is
the
pleasure
of
my
playmate
of
the
empty
days
to
draw
my
heart
on
to
him
and
i
know
not
why
this
sudden
call
to
what
useless
inconsequence
an
innocence
a
simplicity
that
one
does
not
find
elsewhere
in
literature
makes
the
birds
and
the
leaves
seem
as
near
to
him
as
they
are
near
to
children
and
the
changes
of
the
seasons
great
events
as
before
our
thoughts
had
arisen
between
them
and
us
at
times
i
wonder
if
he
has
it
from
the
literature
of
bengal
or
from
religion
and
at
other
times
remembering
the
birds
alighting
on
his
hands
i
find
pleasure
in
thinking
it
hereditary
a
mystery
that
was
growing
through
the
centuries
like
the
courtesy
of
a
tristan
or
a
pelanore
indeed
when
he
is
speaking
of
children
so
much
a
part
of
himself
this
quality
seems
one
is
not
certain
that
he
is
not
also
speaking
of
the
saints
build
their
houses
with
sand
and
they
play
with
empty
shells
with
withered
leaves
they
weave
their
boats
and
smilingly
float
them
on
the
vast
deep
children
have
their
play
on
the
seashore
of
worlds
they
know
not
how
to
swim
they
know
not
how
to
cast
nets
pearl
fishers
dive
for
pearls
merchants
sail
in
their
ships
while
children
gather
pebbles
and
scatter
them
again
they
seek
not
for
hidden
treasures
they
know
not
how
to
cast
nets
yeats
gitanjali
thou
hast
made
me
endless
such
is
thy
pleasure
this
frail
vessel
thou
emptiest
again
and
again
and
fillest
it
ever
with
fresh
life
this
little
flute
of
a
reed
thou
hast
carried
over
hills
and
dales
and
hast
breathed
through
it
melodies
eternally
new
at
the
immortal
touch
of
thy
hands
my
little
heart
loses
its
limits
in
joy
and
gives
birth
to
utterance
ineffable
thy
infinite
gifts
come
to
me
only
on
these
very
small
hands
of
mine
ages
pass
and
still
thou
pourest
and
still
there
is
room
to
fill
when
thou
commandest
me
to
sing
it
seems
that
my
heart
would
break
with
pride
and
i
look
to
thy
face
and
tears
come
to
my
eyes
all
that
is
harsh
and
dissonant
in
my
life
melts
into
one
sweet
harmony
and
my
adoration
spreads
wings
like
a
glad
bird
on
its
flight
across
the
sea
i
know
thou
takest
pleasure
in
my
singing
i
know
that
only
as
a
singer
i
come
before
thy
presence
i
touch
by
the
edge
of
the
wing
of
my
song
thy
feet
which
i
could
never
aspire
to
reach
drunk
with
the
joy
of
singing
i
forget
myself
and
call
thee
friend
who
art
my
lord
i
know
not
how
thou
singest
my
master
i
ever
listen
in
silent
amazement
the
light
of
thy
music
illumines
the
world
the
life
breath
of
thy
music
runs
from
sky
to
sky
the
holy
stream
of
thy
music
breaks
through
all
stony
obstacles
and
rushes
on
my
heart
longs
to
join
in
thy
song
but
vainly
struggles
for
a
voice
i
would
speak
but
speech
breaks
not
into
song
and
i
cry
out
baffled
ah
thou
hast
made
my
heart
captive
in
the
endless
meshes
of
thy
music
my
master
life
of
my
life
i
shall
ever
try
to
keep
my
body
pure
knowing
that
thy
living
touch
is
upon
all
my
limbs
i
shall
ever
try
to
keep
all
untruths
out
from
my
thoughts
knowing
that
thou
art
that
truth
which
has
kindled
the
light
of
reason
in
my
mind
i
shall
ever
try
to
drive
all
evils
away
from
my
heart
and
keep
my
love
in
flower
knowing
that
thou
hast
thy
seat
in
the
inmost
shrine
of
my
heart
and
it
shall
be
my
endeavour
to
reveal
thee
in
my
actions
knowing
it
is
thy
power
gives
me
strength
to
act
i
ask
for
a
moment
indulgence
to
sit
by
thy
side
the
works
that
i
have
in
hand
i
will
finish
afterwards
away
from
the
sight
of
thy
face
my
heart
knows
no
rest
nor
respite
and
my
work
becomes
an
endless
toil
in
a
shoreless
sea
of
toil
today
the
summer
has
come
at
my
window
with
its
sighs
and
murmurs
and
the
bees
are
plying
their
minstrelsy
at
the
court
of
the
flowering
grove
now
it
is
time
to
sit
quite
face
to
face
with
thee
and
to
sing
dedication
of
life
in
this
silent
and
overflowing
leisure
pluck
this
little
flower
and
take
it
delay
not
i
fear
lest
it
droop
and
drop
into
the
dust
i
may
not
find
a
place
in
thy
garland
but
honour
it
with
a
touch
of
pain
from
thy
hand
and
pluck
it
i
fear
lest
the
day
end
before
i
am
aware
and
the
time
of
offering
go
by
though
its
colour
be
not
deep
and
its
smell
be
faint
use
this
flower
in
thy
service
and
pluck
it
while
there
is
time
my
song
has
put
off
her
adornments
she
has
no
pride
of
dress
and
decoration
ornaments
would
mar
our
union
they
would
come
between
thee
and
me
their
jingling
would
drown
thy
whispers
my
poet
vanity
dies
in
shame
before
thy
sight
o
master
poet
i
have
sat
down
at
thy
feet
only
let
me
make
my
life
simple
and
straight
like
a
flute
of
reed
for
thee
to
fill
with
music
the
child
who
is
decked
with
prince
robes
and
who
has
jewelled
chains
round
his
neck
loses
all
pleasure
in
his
play
his
dress
hampers
him
at
every
step
in
fear
that
it
may
be
frayed
or
stained
with
dust
he
keeps
himself
from
the
world
and
is
afraid
even
to
move
mother
it
is
no
gain
thy
bondage
of
finery
if
it
keep
one
shut
off
from
the
healthful
dust
of
the
earth
if
it
rob
one
of
the
right
of
entrance
to
the
great
fair
of
common
human
life
o
fool
try
to
carry
thyself
upon
thy
own
shoulders
o
beggar
to
come
beg
at
thy
own
door
leave
all
thy
burdens
on
his
hands
who
can
bear
all
and
never
look
behind
in
regret
thy
desire
at
once
puts
out
the
light
from
the
lamp
it
touches
with
its
breath
it
is
unholy
take
not
thy
gifts
through
its
unclean
hands
accept
only
what
is
offered
by
sacred
love
here
is
thy
footstool
and
there
rest
thy
feet
where
live
the
poorest
and
lowliest
and
lost
when
i
try
to
bow
to
thee
my
obeisance
can
not
reach
down
to
the
depth
where
thy
feet
rest
among
the
poorest
and
lowliest
and
lost
pride
can
never
approach
to
where
thou
walkest
in
the
clothes
of
the
humble
among
the
poorest
and
lowliest
and
lost
my
heart
can
never
find
its
way
to
where
thou
keepest
company
with
the
companionless
among
the
poorest
the
lowliest
and
the
lost
leave
this
chanting
and
singing
and
telling
of
beads
whom
dost
thou
worship
in
this
lonely
dark
corner
of
a
temple
with
doors
all
shut
open
thine
eyes
and
see
thy
god
is
not
before
thee
he
is
there
where
the
tiller
is
tilling
the
hard
ground
and
where
the
pathmaker
is
breaking
stones
he
is
with
them
in
sun
and
in
shower
and
his
garment
is
covered
with
dust
put
of
thy
holy
mantle
and
even
like
him
come
down
on
the
dusty
soil
deliverance
where
is
this
deliverance
to
be
found
our
master
himself
has
joyfully
taken
upon
him
the
bonds
of
creation
he
is
bound
with
us
all
for
ever
come
out
of
thy
meditations
and
leave
aside
thy
flowers
and
incense
what
harm
is
there
if
thy
clothes
become
tattered
and
stained
meet
him
and
stand
by
him
in
toil
and
in
sweat
of
thy
brow
the
time
that
my
journey
takes
is
long
and
the
way
of
it
long
i
came
out
on
the
chariot
of
the
first
gleam
of
light
and
pursued
my
voyage
through
the
wildernesses
of
worlds
leaving
my
track
on
many
a
star
and
planet
it
is
the
most
distant
course
that
comes
nearest
to
thyself
and
that
training
is
the
most
intricate
which
leads
to
the
utter
simplicity
of
a
tune
the
traveller
has
to
knock
at
every
alien
door
to
come
to
his
own
and
one
has
to
wander
through
all
the
outer
worlds
to
reach
the
innermost
shrine
at
the
end
my
eyes
strayed
far
and
wide
before
i
shut
them
and
said
art
thou
the
question
and
the
cry
where
melt
into
tears
of
a
thousand
streams
and
deluge
the
world
with
the
flood
of
the
assurance
am
the
song
that
i
came
to
sing
remains
unsung
to
this
day
i
have
spent
my
days
in
stringing
and
in
unstringing
my
instrument
the
time
has
not
come
true
the
words
have
not
been
rightly
set
only
there
is
the
agony
of
wishing
in
my
heart
the
blossom
has
not
opened
only
the
wind
is
sighing
by
i
have
not
seen
his
face
nor
have
i
listened
to
his
voice
only
i
have
heard
his
gentle
footsteps
from
the
road
before
my
house
the
livelong
day
has
passed
in
spreading
his
seat
on
the
floor
but
the
lamp
has
not
been
lit
and
i
can
not
ask
him
into
my
house
i
live
in
the
hope
of
meeting
with
him
but
this
meeting
is
not
yet
my
desires
are
many
and
my
cry
is
pitiful
but
ever
didst
thou
save
me
by
hard
refusals
and
this
strong
mercy
has
been
wrought
into
my
life
through
and
through
day
by
day
thou
art
making
me
worthy
of
the
simple
great
gifts
that
thou
gavest
to
me
unasked
this
sky
and
the
light
this
body
and
the
life
and
the
mind
saving
me
from
perils
of
overmuch
desire
there
are
times
when
i
languidly
linger
and
times
when
i
awaken
and
hurry
in
search
of
my
goal
but
cruelly
thou
hidest
thyself
from
before
me
day
by
day
thou
art
making
me
worthy
of
thy
full
acceptance
by
refusing
me
ever
and
anon
saving
me
from
perils
of
weak
uncertain
desire
i
am
here
to
sing
thee
songs
in
this
hall
of
thine
i
have
a
corner
seat
in
thy
world
i
have
no
work
to
do
my
useless
life
can
only
break
out
in
tunes
without
a
purpose
when
the
hour
strikes
for
thy
silent
worship
at
the
dark
temple
of
midnight
command
me
my
master
to
stand
before
thee
to
sing
when
in
the
morning
air
the
golden
harp
is
tuned
honour
me
commanding
my
presence
i
have
had
my
invitation
to
this
world
festival
and
thus
my
life
has
been
blessed
my
eyes
have
seen
and
my
ears
have
heard
it
was
my
part
at
this
feast
to
play
upon
my
instrument
and
i
have
done
all
i
could
now
i
ask
has
the
time
come
at
last
when
i
may
go
in
and
see
thy
face
and
offer
thee
my
silent
salutation
i
am
only
waiting
for
love
to
give
myself
up
at
last
into
his
hands
that
is
why
it
is
so
late
and
why
i
have
been
guilty
of
such
omissions
they
come
with
their
laws
and
their
codes
to
bind
me
fast
but
i
evade
them
ever
for
i
am
only
waiting
for
love
to
give
myself
up
at
last
into
his
hands
people
blame
me
and
call
me
heedless
i
doubt
not
they
are
right
in
their
blame
the
market
day
is
over
and
work
is
all
done
for
the
busy
those
who
came
to
call
me
in
vain
have
gone
back
in
anger
i
am
only
waiting
for
love
to
give
myself
up
at
last
into
his
hands
clouds
heap
upon
clouds
and
it
darkens
ah
love
why
dost
thou
let
me
wait
outside
at
the
door
all
alone
in
the
busy
moments
of
the
noontide
work
i
am
with
the
crowd
but
on
this
dark
lonely
day
it
is
only
for
thee
that
i
hope
if
thou
showest
me
not
thy
face
if
thou
leavest
me
wholly
aside
i
know
not
how
i
am
to
pass
these
long
rainy
hours
i
keep
gazing
on
the
gloom
of
the
sky
and
my
heart
wanders
wailing
with
the
restless
wind
if
thou
speakest
not
i
will
fill
my
heart
with
thy
silence
and
endure
it
i
will
keep
still
and
wait
like
the
night
with
starry
vigil
and
its
head
bent
low
with
patience
the
morning
will
surely
come
the
darkness
will
vanish
and
thy
voice
pour
down
in
golden
streams
breaking
through
the
sky
then
thy
words
will
take
wing
in
songs
from
every
one
of
my
birds
nests
and
thy
melodies
will
break
forth
in
flowers
in
all
my
forest
groves
on
the
day
when
the
lotus
bloomed
alas
my
mind
was
straying
and
i
knew
it
not
my
basket
was
empty
and
the
flower
remained
unheeded
only
now
and
again
a
sadness
fell
upon
me
and
i
started
up
from
my
dream
and
felt
a
sweet
trace
of
a
strange
fragrance
in
the
south
wind
that
vague
sweetness
made
my
heart
ache
with
longing
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
is
was
the
eager
breath
of
the
summer
seeking
for
its
completion
i
knew
not
then
that
it
was
so
near
that
it
was
mine
and
that
this
perfect
sweetness
had
blossomed
in
the
depth
of
my
own
heart
i
must
launch
out
my
boat
the
languid
hours
pass
by
on
the
shore
alas
for
me
the
spring
has
done
its
flowering
and
taken
leave
and
now
with
the
burden
of
faded
futile
flowers
i
wait
and
linger
the
waves
have
become
clamorous
and
upon
the
bank
in
the
shady
lane
the
yellow
leaves
flutter
and
fall
what
emptiness
do
you
gaze
upon
do
you
not
feel
a
thrill
passing
through
the
air
with
the
notes
of
the
song
floating
from
the
other
shore
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
rainy
july
with
secret
steps
thou
walkest
silent
as
night
eluding
all
watchers
today
the
morning
has
closed
its
eyes
heedless
of
the
insistent
calls
of
the
loud
east
wind
and
a
thick
veil
has
been
drawn
over
the
blue
sky
the
woodlands
have
hushed
their
songs
and
doors
are
all
shut
at
every
house
thou
art
the
solitary
wayfarer
in
this
deserted
street
oh
my
only
friend
my
best
beloved
the
gates
are
open
in
my
house
do
not
pass
by
like
a
dream
art
thou
abroad
on
this
stormy
night
on
thy
journey
of
love
my
friend
the
sky
groans
like
one
in
despair
i
have
no
sleep
tonight
ever
and
again
i
open
my
door
and
look
out
on
the
darkness
my
friend
i
can
see
nothing
before
me
i
wonder
where
lies
thy
path
by
what
dim
shore
of
the
river
by
what
far
edge
of
the
frowning
forest
through
what
mazy
depth
of
gloom
art
thou
threading
thy
course
to
come
to
me
my
friend
if
the
day
is
done
if
birds
sing
no
more
if
the
wind
has
flagged
tired
then
draw
the
veil
of
darkness
thick
upon
me
even
as
thou
hast
wrapt
the
earth
with
the
coverlet
of
sleep
and
tenderly
closed
the
petals
of
the
drooping
lotus
at
dusk
from
the
traveller
whose
sack
of
provisions
is
empty
before
the
voyage
is
ended
whose
garment
is
torn
and
dustladen
whose
strength
is
exhausted
remove
shame
and
poverty
and
renew
his
life
like
a
flower
under
the
cover
of
thy
kindly
night
in
the
night
of
weariness
let
me
give
myself
up
to
sleep
without
struggle
resting
my
trust
upon
thee
let
me
not
force
my
flagging
spirit
into
a
poor
preparation
for
thy
worship
it
is
thou
who
drawest
the
veil
of
night
upon
the
tired
eyes
of
the
day
to
renew
its
sight
in
a
fresher
gladness
of
awakening
he
came
and
sat
by
my
side
but
i
woke
not
what
a
cursed
sleep
it
was
o
miserable
me
he
came
when
the
night
was
still
he
had
his
harp
in
his
hands
and
my
dreams
became
resonant
with
its
melodies
alas
why
are
my
nights
all
thus
lost
ah
why
do
i
ever
miss
his
sight
whose
breath
touches
my
sleep
light
oh
where
is
the
light
kindle
it
with
the
burning
fire
of
desire
there
is
the
lamp
but
never
a
flicker
of
a
flame
is
such
thy
fate
my
heart
ah
death
were
better
by
far
for
thee
misery
knocks
at
thy
door
and
her
message
is
that
thy
lord
is
wakeful
and
he
calls
thee
to
the
through
the
darkness
of
night
the
sky
is
overcast
with
clouds
and
the
rain
is
ceaseless
i
know
not
what
this
is
that
stirs
in
me
i
know
not
its
meaning
a
moment
flash
of
lightning
drags
down
a
deeper
gloom
on
my
sight
and
my
heart
gropes
for
the
path
to
where
the
music
of
the
night
calls
me
light
oh
where
is
the
light
kindle
it
with
the
burning
fire
of
desire
it
thunders
and
the
wind
rushes
screaming
through
the
void
the
night
is
black
as
a
black
stone
let
not
the
hours
pass
by
in
the
dark
kindle
the
lamp
of
love
with
thy
life
obstinate
are
the
trammels
but
my
heart
aches
when
i
try
to
break
them
freedom
is
all
i
want
but
to
hope
for
it
i
feel
ashamed
i
am
certain
that
priceless
wealth
is
in
thee
and
that
thou
art
my
best
friend
but
i
have
not
the
heart
to
sweep
away
the
tinsel
that
fills
my
room
the
shroud
that
covers
me
is
a
shroud
of
dust
and
death
i
hate
it
yet
hug
it
in
love
my
debts
are
large
my
failures
great
my
shame
secret
and
heavy
yet
when
i
come
to
ask
for
my
good
i
quake
in
fear
lest
my
prayer
be
granted
he
whom
i
enclose
with
my
name
is
weeping
in
this
dungeon
i
am
ever
busy
building
this
wall
all
around
and
as
this
wall
goes
up
into
the
sky
day
by
day
i
lose
sight
of
my
true
being
in
its
dark
shadow
i
take
pride
in
this
great
wall
and
i
plaster
it
with
dust
and
sand
lest
a
least
hole
should
be
left
in
this
name
and
for
all
the
care
i
take
i
lose
sight
of
my
true
being
i
came
out
alone
on
my
way
to
my
tryst
but
who
is
this
that
follows
me
in
the
silent
dark
i
move
aside
to
avoid
his
presence
but
i
escape
him
not
he
makes
the
dust
rise
from
the
earth
with
his
swagger
he
adds
his
loud
voice
to
every
word
that
i
utter
he
is
my
own
little
self
my
lord
he
knows
no
shame
but
i
am
ashamed
to
come
to
thy
door
in
his
company
tell
me
who
was
it
that
bound
you
was
my
master
said
the
prisoner
thought
i
could
outdo
everybody
in
the
world
in
wealth
and
power
and
i
amassed
in
my
own
the
money
due
to
my
king
when
sleep
overcame
me
i
lay
upon
the
bed
that
was
for
my
lord
and
on
waking
up
i
found
i
was
a
prisoner
in
my
own
tell
me
who
was
it
that
wrought
this
unbreakable
chain
was
i
said
the
prisoner
forged
this
chain
very
carefully
i
thought
my
invincible
power
would
hold
the
world
captive
leaving
me
in
a
freedom
undisturbed
thus
night
and
day
i
worked
at
the
chain
with
huge
fires
and
cruel
hard
strokes
when
at
last
the
work
was
done
and
the
links
were
complete
and
unbreakable
i
found
that
it
held
me
in
its
grip
by
all
means
they
try
to
hold
me
secure
who
love
me
in
this
world
but
it
is
otherwise
with
thy
love
which
is
greater
than
theirs
and
thou
keepest
me
free
lest
i
forget
them
they
never
venture
to
leave
me
alone
but
day
passes
by
after
day
and
thou
art
not
seen
if
i
call
not
thee
in
my
prayers
if
i
keep
not
thee
in
my
heart
thy
love
for
me
still
waits
for
my
love
when
it
was
day
they
came
into
my
house
and
said
shall
only
take
the
smallest
room
here
they
said
shall
help
you
in
the
worship
of
your
god
and
humbly
accept
only
our
own
share
in
his
grace
and
then
they
took
their
seat
in
a
corner
and
they
sat
quiet
and
meek
but
in
the
darkness
of
night
i
find
they
break
into
my
sacred
shrine
strong
and
turbulent
and
snatch
with
unholy
greed
the
offerings
from
god
altar
let
only
that
little
be
left
of
me
whereby
i
may
name
thee
my
all
let
only
that
little
be
left
of
my
will
whereby
i
may
feel
thee
on
every
side
and
come
to
thee
in
everything
and
offer
to
thee
my
love
every
moment
let
only
that
little
be
left
of
me
whereby
i
may
never
hide
thee
let
only
that
little
of
my
fetters
be
left
whereby
i
am
bound
with
thy
will
and
thy
purpose
is
carried
out
in
my
life
and
that
is
the
fetter
of
thy
love
where
the
mind
is
without
fear
and
the
head
is
held
high
where
knowledge
is
free
where
the
world
has
not
been
broken
up
into
fragments
by
narrow
domestic
walls
where
words
come
out
from
the
depth
of
truth
where
tireless
striving
stretches
its
arms
towards
perfection
where
the
clear
stream
of
reason
has
not
lost
its
way
into
the
dreary
desert
sand
of
dead
habit
where
the
mind
is
led
forward
by
thee
into
thought
and
action
into
that
heaven
of
freedom
my
father
let
my
country
awake
this
is
my
prayer
to
thee
my
lord
strike
strike
at
the
root
of
penury
in
my
heart
give
me
the
strength
lightly
to
bear
my
joys
and
sorrows
give
me
the
strength
to
make
my
love
fruitful
in
service
give
me
the
strength
never
to
disown
the
poor
or
bend
my
knees
before
insolent
might
give
me
the
strength
to
raise
my
mind
high
above
daily
trifles
and
give
me
the
strength
to
surrender
my
strength
to
thy
will
with
love
i
thought
that
my
voyage
had
come
to
its
end
at
the
last
limit
of
my
power
that
the
path
before
me
was
closed
that
provisions
were
exhausted
and
the
time
come
to
take
shelter
in
a
silent
obscurity
but
i
find
that
thy
will
knows
no
end
in
me
and
when
old
words
die
out
on
the
tongue
new
melodies
break
forth
from
the
heart
and
where
the
old
tracks
are
lost
new
country
is
revealed
with
its
wonders
that
i
want
thee
only
thee
let
my
heart
repeat
without
end
all
desires
that
distract
me
day
and
night
are
false
and
empty
to
the
core
as
the
night
keeps
hidden
in
its
gloom
the
petition
for
light
even
thus
in
the
depth
of
my
unconsciousness
rings
the
cry
want
thee
only
thee
as
the
storm
still
seeks
its
end
in
peace
when
it
strikes
against
peace
with
all
its
might
even
thus
my
rebellion
strikes
against
thy
love
and
still
its
cry
is
want
thee
only
thee
when
the
heart
is
hard
and
parched
up
come
upon
me
with
a
shower
of
mercy
when
grace
is
lost
from
life
come
with
a
burst
of
song
when
tumultuous
work
raises
its
din
on
all
sides
shutting
me
out
from
beyond
come
to
me
my
lord
of
silence
with
thy
peace
and
rest
when
my
beggarly
heart
sits
crouched
shut
up
in
a
corner
break
open
the
door
my
king
and
come
with
the
ceremony
of
a
king
when
desire
blinds
the
mind
with
delusion
and
dust
o
thou
holy
one
thou
wakeful
come
with
thy
light
and
thy
thunder
the
rain
has
held
back
for
days
and
days
my
god
in
my
arid
heart
the
horizon
is
fiercely
naked
not
the
thinnest
cover
of
a
soft
cloud
not
the
vaguest
hint
of
a
distant
cool
shower
send
thy
angry
storm
dark
with
death
if
it
is
thy
wish
and
with
lashes
of
lightning
startle
the
sky
from
end
to
end
but
call
back
my
lord
call
back
this
pervading
silent
heat
still
and
keen
and
cruel
burning
the
heart
with
dire
despair
let
the
cloud
of
grace
bend
low
from
above
like
the
tearful
look
of
the
mother
on
the
day
of
the
father
wrath
where
dost
thou
stand
behind
them
all
my
lover
hiding
thyself
in
the
shadows
they
push
thee
and
pass
thee
by
on
the
dusty
road
taking
thee
for
naught
i
wait
here
weary
hours
spreading
my
offerings
for
thee
while
come
and
take
my
flowers
one
by
one
and
my
basket
is
nearly
empty
the
morning
time
is
past
and
the
noon
in
the
shade
of
evening
my
eyes
are
drowsy
with
sleep
men
going
home
glance
at
me
and
smile
and
fill
me
with
shame
i
sit
like
a
beggar
maid
drawing
my
skirt
over
my
face
and
when
they
ask
me
what
it
is
i
want
i
drop
my
eyes
and
answer
them
not
oh
how
indeed
could
i
tell
them
that
for
thee
i
wait
and
that
thou
hast
promised
to
come
how
could
i
utter
for
shame
that
i
keep
for
my
dowry
this
poverty
ah
i
hug
this
pride
in
the
secret
of
my
heart
i
sit
on
the
grass
and
gaze
upon
the
sky
and
dream
of
the
sudden
splendour
of
thy
coming
all
the
lights
ablaze
golden
pennons
flying
over
thy
car
and
they
at
the
roadside
standing
agape
when
they
see
thee
come
down
from
thy
seat
to
raise
me
from
the
dust
and
set
at
thy
side
this
ragged
beggar
girl
with
shame
and
pride
like
a
creeper
in
a
summer
breeze
but
time
glides
on
and
still
no
sound
of
the
wheels
of
thy
chariot
many
a
procession
passes
by
with
noise
and
shouts
and
glamour
of
glory
is
it
only
thou
who
wouldst
stand
in
the
shadow
silent
and
behind
them
all
and
only
i
who
would
wait
and
weep
and
wear
out
my
heart
in
vain
longing
early
in
the
day
it
was
whispered
that
we
should
sail
in
a
boat
only
thou
and
i
and
never
a
soul
in
the
world
would
know
of
this
our
pilgrimage
to
no
country
and
to
no
end
in
that
shoreless
ocean
at
thy
silently
listening
smile
my
songs
would
swell
in
melodies
free
as
waves
free
from
all
bondage
of
words
is
the
time
not
come
yet
are
there
works
still
to
do
lo
the
evening
has
come
down
upon
the
shore
and
in
the
fading
light
the
seabirds
come
flying
to
their
nests
who
knows
when
the
chains
will
be
off
and
the
boat
like
the
last
glimmer
of
sunset
vanish
into
the
night
the
day
was
when
i
did
not
keep
myself
in
readiness
for
thee
and
entering
my
heart
unbidden
even
as
one
of
the
common
crowd
unknown
to
me
my
king
thou
didst
press
the
signet
of
eternity
upon
many
a
fleeting
moment
of
my
life
and
today
when
by
chance
i
light
upon
them
and
see
thy
signature
i
find
they
have
lain
scattered
in
the
dust
mixed
with
the
memory
of
joys
and
sorrows
of
my
trivial
days
forgotten
thou
didst
not
turn
in
contempt
from
my
childish
play
among
dust
and
the
steps
that
i
heard
in
my
playroom
are
the
same
that
are
echoing
from
star
to
star
this
is
my
delight
thus
to
wait
and
watch
at
the
wayside
where
shadow
chases
light
and
the
rain
comes
in
the
wake
of
the
summer
messengers
with
tidings
from
unknown
skies
greet
me
and
speed
along
the
road
my
heart
is
glad
within
and
the
breath
of
the
passing
breeze
is
sweet
from
dawn
till
dusk
i
sit
here
before
my
door
and
i
know
that
of
a
sudden
the
happy
moment
will
arrive
when
i
shall
see
in
the
meanwhile
i
smile
and
i
sing
all
alone
in
the
meanwhile
the
air
is
filling
with
the
perfume
of
promise
have
you
not
heard
his
silent
steps
he
comes
comes
ever
comes
every
moment
and
every
age
every
day
and
every
night
he
comes
comes
ever
comes
many
a
song
have
i
sung
in
many
a
mood
of
mind
but
all
their
notes
have
always
proclaimed
comes
comes
ever
comes
in
the
fragrant
days
of
sunny
april
through
the
forest
path
he
comes
comes
ever
comes
in
the
rainy
gloom
of
july
nights
on
the
thundering
chariot
of
clouds
he
comes
comes
ever
comes
in
sorrow
after
sorrow
it
is
his
steps
that
press
upon
my
heart
and
it
is
the
golden
touch
of
his
feet
that
makes
my
joy
to
shine
i
know
not
from
what
distant
time
thou
art
ever
coming
nearer
to
meet
me
thy
sun
and
stars
can
never
keep
thee
hidden
from
me
for
aye
in
many
a
morning
and
eve
thy
footsteps
have
been
heard
and
thy
messenger
has
come
within
my
heart
and
called
me
in
secret
i
know
not
only
why
today
my
life
is
all
astir
and
a
feeling
of
tremulous
joy
is
passing
through
my
heart
it
is
as
if
the
time
were
come
to
wind
up
my
work
and
i
feel
in
the
air
a
faint
smell
of
thy
sweet
presence
the
night
is
nearly
spent
waiting
for
him
in
vain
i
fear
lest
in
the
morning
he
suddenly
come
to
my
door
when
i
have
fallen
asleep
wearied
out
oh
friends
leave
the
way
open
to
him
forbid
him
not
if
the
sounds
of
his
steps
does
not
wake
me
do
not
try
to
rouse
me
i
pray
i
wish
not
to
be
called
from
my
sleep
by
the
clamorous
choir
of
birds
by
the
riot
of
wind
at
the
festival
of
morning
light
let
me
sleep
undisturbed
even
if
my
lord
comes
of
a
sudden
to
my
door
ah
my
sleep
precious
sleep
which
only
waits
for
his
touch
to
vanish
ah
my
closed
eyes
that
would
open
their
lids
only
to
the
light
of
his
smile
when
he
stands
before
me
like
a
dream
emerging
from
darkness
of
sleep
let
him
appear
before
my
sight
as
the
first
of
all
lights
and
all
forms
the
first
thrill
of
joy
to
my
awakened
soul
let
it
come
from
his
glance
and
let
my
return
to
myself
be
immediate
return
to
him
the
morning
sea
of
silence
broke
into
ripples
of
bird
songs
and
the
flowers
were
all
merry
by
the
roadside
and
the
wealth
of
gold
was
scattered
through
the
rift
of
the
clouds
while
we
busily
went
on
our
way
and
paid
no
heed
we
sang
no
glad
songs
nor
played
we
went
not
to
the
village
for
barter
we
spoke
not
a
word
nor
smiled
we
lingered
not
on
the
way
we
quickened
our
pace
more
and
more
as
the
time
sped
by
the
sun
rose
to
the
mid
sky
and
doves
cooed
in
the
shade
withered
leaves
danced
and
whirled
in
the
hot
air
of
noon
the
shepherd
boy
drowsed
and
dreamed
in
the
shadow
of
the
banyan
tree
and
i
laid
myself
down
by
the
water
and
stretched
my
tired
limbs
on
the
grass
my
companions
laughed
at
me
in
scorn
they
held
their
heads
high
and
hurried
on
they
never
looked
back
nor
rested
they
vanished
in
the
distant
blue
haze
they
crossed
many
meadows
and
hills
and
passed
through
strange
countries
all
honour
to
you
heroic
host
of
the
interminable
path
mockery
and
reproach
pricked
me
to
rise
but
found
no
response
in
me
i
gave
myself
up
for
lost
in
the
depth
of
a
glad
humiliation
in
the
shadow
of
a
dim
delight
the
repose
of
the
green
gloom
slowly
spread
over
my
heart
i
forgot
for
what
i
had
travelled
and
i
surrendered
my
mind
without
struggle
to
the
maze
of
shadows
and
songs
at
last
when
i
woke
from
my
slumber
and
opened
my
eyes
i
saw
thee
standing
by
me
flooding
my
sleep
with
thy
smile
how
i
had
feared
that
the
path
was
long
and
wearisome
and
the
struggle
to
reach
thee
was
hard
you
came
down
from
your
throne
and
stood
at
my
cottage
door
i
was
singing
all
alone
in
a
corner
and
the
melody
caught
your
ear
you
came
down
and
stood
at
my
cottage
door
masters
are
many
in
your
hall
and
songs
are
sung
there
at
all
hours
but
the
simple
carol
of
this
novice
struck
at
your
love
one
plaintive
little
strain
mingled
with
the
great
music
of
the
world
and
with
a
flower
for
a
prize
you
came
down
and
stopped
at
my
cottage
door
i
had
gone
from
door
to
door
in
the
village
path
when
thy
golden
chariot
appeared
in
the
distance
like
a
gorgeous
dream
and
i
wondered
who
was
this
king
of
all
kings
my
hopes
rose
high
and
methought
my
evil
days
were
at
an
end
and
i
stood
waiting
for
alms
to
be
given
unasked
and
for
wealth
scattered
on
all
sides
in
the
dust
the
chariot
stopped
where
i
stood
thy
glance
fell
on
me
and
thou
camest
down
with
a
smile
i
felt
that
the
luck
of
my
life
had
come
at
last
then
of
a
sudden
thou
didst
hold
out
thy
right
hand
and
say
hast
thou
to
give
to
me
ah
what
a
kingly
jest
was
it
to
open
thy
palm
to
a
beggar
to
beg
i
was
confused
and
stood
undecided
and
then
from
my
wallet
i
slowly
took
out
the
least
little
grain
of
corn
and
gave
it
to
thee
but
how
great
my
surprise
when
at
the
day
end
i
emptied
my
bag
on
the
floor
to
find
a
least
little
gram
of
gold
among
the
poor
heap
i
bitterly
wept
and
wished
that
i
had
had
the
heart
to
give
thee
my
all
the
night
darkened
our
day
works
had
been
done
we
thought
that
the
last
guest
had
arrived
for
the
night
and
the
doors
in
the
village
were
all
shut
only
some
said
the
king
was
to
come
we
laughed
and
said
it
can
not
be
it
seemed
there
were
knocks
at
the
door
and
we
said
it
was
nothing
but
the
wind
we
put
out
the
lamps
and
lay
down
to
sleep
only
some
said
is
the
messenger
we
laughed
and
said
it
must
be
the
wind
there
came
a
sound
in
the
dead
of
the
night
we
sleepily
thought
it
was
the
distant
thunder
the
earth
shook
the
walls
rocked
and
it
troubled
us
in
our
sleep
only
some
said
it
was
the
sound
of
wheels
we
said
in
a
drowsy
murmur
it
must
be
the
rumbling
of
clouds
the
night
was
still
dark
when
the
drum
sounded
the
voice
came
up
delay
not
we
pressed
our
hands
on
our
hearts
and
shuddered
with
fear
some
said
there
is
the
king
flag
we
stood
up
on
our
feet
and
cried
is
no
time
for
delay
the
king
has
come
but
where
are
lights
where
are
wreaths
where
is
the
throne
to
seat
him
oh
shame
oh
utter
shame
where
is
the
hall
the
decorations
someone
has
said
is
this
cry
greet
him
with
empty
hands
lead
him
into
thy
rooms
all
bare
open
the
doors
let
the
be
sounded
in
the
depth
of
the
night
has
come
the
king
of
our
dark
dreary
house
the
thunder
roars
in
the
sky
the
darkness
shudders
with
lightning
bring
out
thy
tattered
piece
of
mat
and
spread
it
in
the
courtyard
with
the
storm
has
come
of
a
sudden
our
king
of
the
fearful
night
i
thought
i
should
ask
of
thee
but
i
dared
not
the
rose
wreath
thou
hadst
on
thy
neck
thus
i
waited
for
the
morning
when
thou
didst
depart
to
find
a
few
fragments
on
the
bed
and
like
a
beggar
i
searched
in
the
dawn
only
for
a
stray
petal
or
two
ah
me
what
is
it
i
find
what
token
left
of
thy
love
it
is
no
flower
no
spices
no
vase
of
perfumed
water
it
is
thy
mighty
sword
flashing
as
a
flame
heavy
as
a
bolt
of
thunder
the
young
light
of
morning
comes
through
the
window
and
spreads
itself
upon
thy
bed
the
morning
bird
twitters
and
asks
what
hast
thou
got
no
it
is
no
flower
nor
spices
nor
vase
of
perfumed
water
it
is
thy
dreadful
sword
i
sit
and
muse
in
wonder
what
gift
is
this
of
thine
i
can
find
no
place
to
hide
it
i
am
ashamed
to
wear
it
frail
as
i
am
and
it
hurts
me
when
i
press
it
to
my
bosom
yet
shall
i
bear
in
my
heart
this
honour
of
the
burden
of
pain
this
gift
of
thine
from
now
there
shall
be
no
fear
left
for
me
in
this
world
and
thou
shalt
be
victorious
in
all
my
strife
thou
hast
left
death
for
my
companion
and
i
shall
crown
him
with
my
life
thy
sword
is
with
me
to
cut
asunder
my
bonds
and
there
shall
be
no
fear
left
for
me
in
the
world
from
now
i
leave
off
all
petty
decorations
lord
of
my
heart
no
more
shall
there
be
for
me
waiting
and
weeping
in
corners
no
more
coyness
and
sweetness
of
demeanour
thou
hast
given
me
thy
sword
for
adornment
no
more
doll
decorations
for
me
beautiful
is
thy
wristlet
decked
with
stars
and
cunningly
wrought
in
jewels
but
more
beautiful
to
me
thy
sword
with
its
curve
of
lightning
like
the
outspread
wings
of
the
divine
bird
of
vishnu
perfectly
poised
in
the
angry
red
light
of
the
sunset
it
quivers
like
the
one
last
response
of
life
in
ecstasy
of
pain
at
the
final
stroke
of
death
it
shines
like
the
pure
flame
of
being
burning
up
earthly
sense
with
one
fierce
flash
beautiful
is
thy
wristlet
decked
with
starry
gems
but
thy
sword
o
lord
of
thunder
is
wrought
with
uttermost
beauty
terrible
to
behold
or
think
of
i
asked
nothing
from
thee
i
uttered
not
my
name
to
thine
ear
when
thou
thy
leave
i
stood
silent
i
was
alone
by
the
well
where
the
shadow
of
the
tree
fell
aslant
and
the
women
had
gone
home
with
their
brown
earthen
pitchers
full
to
the
brim
they
called
me
and
shouted
with
us
the
morning
is
wearing
on
to
noon
but
i
languidly
lingered
awhile
lost
in
the
midst
of
vague
musings
i
heard
not
thy
steps
as
thou
camest
thine
eyes
were
sad
when
they
fell
on
me
thy
voice
was
tired
as
thou
spokest
low
i
am
a
thirsty
traveller
i
started
up
from
my
and
poured
water
from
my
jar
on
thy
joined
palms
the
leaves
rustled
overhead
the
cuckoo
sang
from
the
unseen
dark
and
perfume
of
flowers
came
from
the
bend
of
the
road
i
stood
speechless
with
shame
when
my
name
thou
didst
ask
indeed
what
had
i
done
for
thee
to
keep
me
in
remembrance
but
the
memory
that
i
could
give
water
to
thee
to
allay
thy
thirst
will
cling
to
my
heart
and
enfold
it
in
sweetness
the
morning
hour
is
late
the
bird
sings
in
weary
notes
leaves
rustle
overhead
and
i
sit
and
think
and
think
languor
is
upon
your
heart
and
the
slumber
is
still
on
your
eyes
has
not
the
word
come
to
you
that
the
flower
is
reigning
in
splendour
among
thorns
wake
oh
awaken
let
not
the
time
pass
in
vain
at
the
end
of
the
stony
path
in
the
country
of
virgin
solitude
my
friend
is
sitting
all
alone
deceive
him
not
wake
oh
awaken
what
if
the
sky
pants
and
trembles
with
the
heat
of
the
midday
sun
what
if
the
burning
sand
spreads
its
mantle
of
thirst
is
there
no
joy
in
the
deep
of
your
heart
at
every
footfall
of
yours
will
not
the
harp
of
the
road
break
out
in
sweet
music
of
pain
thus
it
is
that
thy
joy
in
me
is
so
full
thus
it
is
that
thou
hast
come
down
to
me
o
thou
lord
of
all
heavens
where
would
be
thy
love
if
i
were
not
thou
hast
taken
me
as
thy
partner
of
all
this
wealth
in
my
heart
is
the
endless
play
of
thy
delight
in
my
life
thy
will
is
ever
taking
shape
and
for
this
thou
who
art
the
king
of
kings
hast
decked
thyself
in
beauty
to
captivate
my
heart
and
for
this
thy
love
loses
itself
in
the
love
of
thy
lover
and
there
art
thou
seen
in
the
perfect
union
of
two
light
my
light
the
light
the
light
light
ah
the
light
dances
my
darling
at
the
centre
of
my
life
the
light
strikes
my
darling
the
chords
of
my
love
the
sky
opens
the
wind
runs
wild
laughter
passes
over
the
earth
the
butterflies
spread
their
sails
on
the
sea
of
light
lilies
and
jasmines
surge
up
on
the
crest
of
the
waves
of
light
the
light
is
shattered
into
gold
on
every
cloud
my
darling
and
it
scatters
gems
in
profusion
mirth
spreads
from
leaf
to
leaf
my
darling
and
gladness
without
measure
the
heaven
river
has
drowned
its
banks
and
the
flood
of
joy
is
abroad
let
all
the
strains
of
joy
mingle
in
my
last
song
the
joy
that
makes
the
earth
flow
over
in
the
riotous
excess
of
the
grass
the
joy
that
sets
the
twin
brothers
life
and
death
dancing
over
the
wide
world
the
joy
that
sweeps
in
with
the
tempest
shaking
and
waking
all
life
with
laughter
the
joy
that
sits
still
with
its
tears
on
the
open
red
lotus
of
pain
and
the
joy
that
throws
everything
it
has
upon
the
dust
and
knows
not
a
word
yes
i
know
this
is
nothing
but
thy
love
o
beloved
of
my
heart
this
golden
light
that
dances
upon
the
leaves
these
idle
clouds
sailing
across
the
sky
this
passing
breeze
leaving
its
coolness
upon
my
forehead
the
morning
light
has
flooded
my
eyes
this
is
thy
message
to
my
heart
thy
face
is
bent
from
above
thy
eyes
look
down
on
my
eyes
and
my
heart
has
touched
thy
feet
on
the
seashore
of
endless
worlds
children
meet
the
infinite
sky
is
motionless
overhead
and
the
restless
water
is
boisterous
on
the
seashore
of
endless
worlds
the
children
meet
with
shouts
and
dances
they
build
their
houses
with
sand
and
they
play
with
empty
shells
with
withered
leaves
they
weave
their
boats
and
smilingly
float
them
on
the
vast
deep
children
have
their
play
on
the
seashore
of
worlds
they
know
not
how
to
swim
they
know
not
how
to
cast
nets
pearl
fishers
dive
for
pearls
merchants
sail
in
their
ships
while
children
gather
pebbles
and
scatter
them
again
they
seek
not
for
hidden
treasures
they
know
not
how
to
cast
nets
the
sea
surges
up
with
laughter
and
pale
gleams
the
smile
of
the
sea
beach
waves
sing
meaningless
ballads
to
the
children
even
like
a
mother
while
rocking
her
baby
cradle
the
sea
plays
with
children
and
pale
gleams
the
smile
of
the
sea
beach
on
the
seashore
of
endless
worlds
children
meet
tempest
roams
in
the
pathless
sky
ships
get
wrecked
in
the
trackless
water
death
is
abroad
and
children
play
on
the
seashore
of
endless
worlds
is
the
great
meeting
of
children
the
sleep
that
flits
on
baby
eyes
does
anybody
know
from
where
it
comes
yes
there
is
a
rumour
that
it
has
its
dwelling
there
in
the
fairy
village
among
shadows
of
the
forest
dimly
lit
with
there
hang
two
timid
buds
of
enchantment
from
there
it
comes
to
kiss
baby
eyes
the
smile
that
flickers
on
baby
lips
when
he
sleeps
does
anybody
know
where
it
was
born
yes
there
is
a
rumour
that
a
young
pale
beam
of
a
crescent
moon
touched
the
edge
of
a
vanishing
autumn
cloud
and
there
the
smile
was
first
born
in
the
dream
of
a
morning
the
smile
that
flickers
on
lips
when
he
sleeps
the
sweet
soft
freshness
that
blooms
on
baby
limbs
does
anybody
know
where
it
was
hidden
so
long
yes
when
the
mother
was
a
young
girl
it
lay
pervading
her
heart
in
tender
and
silent
mystery
of
love
the
sweet
soft
freshness
that
has
bloomed
on
baby
limbs
when
i
bring
to
you
coloured
toys
my
child
i
understand
why
there
is
such
a
play
of
colours
on
clouds
on
water
and
why
flowers
are
painted
in
tints
when
i
give
coloured
toys
to
you
my
child
when
i
sing
to
make
you
dance
i
truly
now
why
there
is
music
in
leaves
and
why
waves
send
their
chorus
of
voices
to
the
heart
of
the
listening
earth
when
i
sing
to
make
you
dance
when
i
bring
sweet
things
to
your
greedy
hands
i
know
why
there
is
honey
in
the
cup
of
the
flowers
and
why
fruits
are
secretly
filled
with
sweet
juice
when
i
bring
sweet
things
to
your
greedy
hands
when
i
kiss
your
face
to
make
you
smile
my
darling
i
surely
understand
what
pleasure
streams
from
the
sky
in
morning
light
and
what
delight
that
is
that
is
which
the
summer
breeze
brings
to
my
body
when
i
kiss
you
to
make
you
smile
thou
hast
made
me
known
to
friends
whom
i
knew
not
thou
hast
given
me
seats
in
homes
not
my
own
thou
hast
brought
the
distant
near
and
made
a
brother
of
the
stranger
i
am
uneasy
at
heart
when
i
have
to
leave
my
accustomed
shelter
i
forget
that
there
abides
the
old
in
the
new
and
that
there
also
thou
abidest
through
birth
and
death
in
this
world
or
in
others
wherever
thou
leadest
me
it
is
thou
the
same
the
one
companion
of
my
endless
life
who
ever
linkest
my
heart
with
bonds
of
joy
to
the
unfamiliar
when
one
knows
thee
then
alien
there
is
none
then
no
door
is
shut
oh
grant
me
my
prayer
that
i
may
never
lose
the
bliss
of
the
touch
of
the
one
in
the
play
of
many
on
the
slope
of
the
desolate
river
among
tall
grasses
i
asked
her
where
do
you
go
shading
your
lamp
with
your
mantle
my
house
is
all
dark
and
lonesome
lend
me
your
light
she
raised
her
dark
eyes
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
my
face
through
the
dusk
have
come
to
the
river
she
said
float
my
lamp
on
the
stream
when
the
daylight
wanes
in
the
west
i
stood
alone
among
tall
grasses
and
watched
the
timid
flame
of
her
lamp
uselessly
drifting
in
the
tide
in
the
silence
of
gathering
night
i
asked
her
your
lights
are
all
lit
then
where
do
you
go
with
your
lamp
my
house
is
all
dark
and
lonesome
lend
me
your
light
she
raised
her
dark
eyes
on
my
face
and
stood
for
a
moment
doubtful
have
come
she
said
at
last
dedicate
my
lamp
to
the
sky
i
stood
and
watched
her
light
uselessly
burning
in
the
void
in
the
moonless
gloom
of
midnight
i
ask
her
what
is
your
quest
holding
the
lamp
near
your
heart
my
house
is
all
dark
and
lonesome
lend
me
your
light
she
stopped
for
a
minute
and
thought
and
gazed
at
my
face
in
the
dark
have
brought
my
light
she
said
join
the
carnival
of
lamps
i
stood
and
watched
her
little
lamp
uselessly
lost
among
lights
what
divine
drink
wouldst
thou
have
my
god
from
this
overflowing
cup
of
my
life
my
poet
is
it
thy
delight
to
see
thy
creation
through
my
eyes
and
to
stand
at
the
portals
of
my
ears
silently
to
listen
to
thine
own
eternal
harmony
thy
world
is
weaving
words
in
my
mind
and
thy
joy
is
adding
music
to
them
thou
givest
thyself
to
me
in
love
and
then
feelest
thine
own
entire
sweetness
in
me
she
who
ever
had
remained
in
the
depth
of
my
being
in
the
twilight
of
gleams
and
of
glimpses
she
who
never
opened
her
veils
in
the
morning
light
will
be
my
last
gift
to
thee
my
god
folded
in
my
final
song
words
have
wooed
yet
failed
to
win
her
persuasion
has
stretched
to
her
its
eager
arms
in
vain
i
have
roamed
from
country
to
country
keeping
her
in
the
core
of
my
heart
and
around
her
have
risen
and
fallen
the
growth
and
decay
of
my
life
over
my
thoughts
and
actions
my
slumbers
and
dreams
she
reigned
yet
dwelled
alone
and
apart
many
a
man
knocked
at
my
door
and
asked
for
her
and
turned
away
in
despair
there
was
none
in
the
world
who
ever
saw
her
face
to
face
and
she
remained
in
her
loneliness
waiting
for
thy
recognition
thou
art
the
sky
and
thou
art
the
nest
as
well
o
thou
beautiful
there
in
the
nest
is
thy
love
that
encloses
the
soul
with
colours
and
sounds
and
odours
there
comes
the
morning
with
the
golden
basket
in
her
right
hand
bearing
the
wreath
of
beauty
silently
to
crown
the
earth
and
there
comes
the
evening
over
the
lonely
meadows
deserted
by
herds
through
trackless
paths
carrying
cool
draughts
of
peace
in
her
golden
pitcher
from
the
western
ocean
of
rest
but
there
where
spreads
the
infinite
sky
for
the
soul
to
take
her
flight
in
reigns
the
stainless
white
radiance
there
is
no
day
nor
night
nor
form
nor
colour
and
never
never
a
word
thy
sunbeam
comes
upon
this
earth
of
mine
with
arms
outstretched
and
stands
at
my
door
the
livelong
day
to
carry
back
to
thy
feet
clouds
made
of
my
tears
and
sighs
and
songs
with
fond
delight
thou
wrappest
about
thy
starry
breast
that
mantle
of
misty
cloud
turning
it
into
numberless
shapes
and
folds
and
colouring
it
with
hues
everchanging
it
is
so
light
and
so
fleeting
tender
and
tearful
and
dark
that
is
why
thou
lovest
it
o
thou
spotless
and
serene
and
that
is
why
it
may
cover
thy
awful
white
light
with
its
pathetic
shadows
the
same
stream
of
life
that
runs
through
my
veins
night
and
day
runs
through
the
world
and
dances
in
rhythmic
measures
it
is
the
same
life
that
shoots
in
joy
through
the
dust
of
the
earth
in
numberless
blades
of
grass
and
breaks
into
tumultuous
waves
of
leaves
and
flowers
it
is
the
same
life
that
is
rocked
in
the
of
birth
and
of
death
in
ebb
and
in
flow
i
feel
my
limbs
are
made
glorious
by
the
touch
of
this
world
of
life
and
my
pride
is
from
the
of
ages
dancing
in
my
blood
this
moment
is
it
beyond
thee
to
be
glad
with
the
gladness
of
this
rhythm
to
be
tossed
and
lost
and
broken
in
the
whirl
of
this
fearful
joy
all
things
rush
on
they
stop
not
they
look
not
behind
no
power
can
hold
them
back
they
rush
on
keeping
steps
with
that
restless
rapid
music
seasons
come
dancing
and
pass
away
colours
tunes
and
perfumes
pour
in
endless
cascades
in
the
abounding
joy
that
scatters
and
gives
up
and
dies
every
moment
that
i
should
make
much
of
myself
and
turn
it
on
all
sides
thus
casting
coloured
shadows
on
thy
radiance
such
is
thy
thou
settest
a
barrier
in
thine
own
being
and
then
callest
thy
severed
self
in
myriad
notes
this
thy
has
taken
body
in
me
the
poignant
song
is
echoed
through
all
the
sky
in
tears
and
smiles
alarms
and
hopes
waves
rise
up
and
sink
again
dreams
break
and
form
in
me
is
thy
own
defeat
of
self
this
screen
that
thou
hast
raised
is
painted
with
innumerable
figures
with
the
brush
of
the
night
and
the
day
behind
it
thy
seat
is
woven
in
wondrous
mysteries
of
curves
casting
away
all
barren
lines
of
straightness
the
great
pageant
of
thee
and
me
has
overspread
the
sky
with
the
tune
of
thee
and
me
all
the
air
is
vibrant
and
all
ages
pass
with
the
hiding
and
seeking
of
thee
and
me
he
it
is
the
innermost
one
who
awakens
my
being
with
his
deep
hidden
touches
he
it
is
who
puts
his
enchantment
upon
these
eyes
and
joyfully
plays
on
the
chords
of
my
heart
in
varied
cadence
of
pleasure
and
pain
he
it
is
who
weaves
the
web
of
this
in
evanescent
hues
of
gold
and
silver
blue
and
green
and
lets
peep
out
through
the
folds
his
feet
at
whose
touch
i
forget
myself
days
come
and
ages
pass
and
it
is
ever
he
who
moves
my
heart
in
many
a
name
in
many
a
guise
in
many
a
rapture
of
joy
and
of
sorrow
deliverance
is
not
for
me
in
renunciation
i
feel
the
embrace
of
freedom
in
a
thousand
bonds
of
delight
thou
ever
pourest
for
me
the
fresh
draught
of
thy
wine
of
various
colours
and
fragrance
filling
this
earthen
vessel
to
the
brim
my
world
will
light
its
hundred
different
lamps
with
thy
flame
and
place
them
before
the
altar
of
thy
temple
no
i
will
never
shut
the
doors
of
my
senses
the
delights
of
sight
and
hearing
and
touch
will
bear
thy
delight
yes
all
my
illusions
will
burn
into
illumination
of
joy
and
all
my
desires
ripen
into
fruits
of
love
the
day
is
no
more
the
shadow
is
upon
the
earth
it
is
time
that
i
go
to
the
stream
to
fill
my
pitcher
the
evening
air
is
eager
with
the
sad
music
of
the
water
ah
it
calls
me
out
into
the
dusk
in
the
lonely
lane
there
is
no
the
wind
is
up
the
ripples
are
rampant
in
the
river
i
know
not
if
i
shall
come
back
home
i
know
not
whom
i
shall
chance
to
meet
there
at
the
fording
in
the
little
boat
the
unknown
man
plays
upon
his
lute
thy
gifts
to
us
mortals
fulfil
all
our
needs
and
yet
run
back
to
thee
undiminished
the
river
has
its
everyday
work
to
do
and
hastens
through
fields
and
hamlets
yet
its
incessant
stream
winds
towards
the
washing
of
thy
feet
the
flower
sweetens
the
air
with
its
perfume
yet
its
last
service
is
to
offer
itself
to
thee
thy
worship
does
not
impoverish
the
world
from
the
words
of
the
poet
men
take
what
meanings
please
them
yet
their
last
meaning
points
to
thee
day
after
day
o
lord
of
my
life
shall
i
stand
before
thee
face
to
face
with
folded
hands
o
lord
of
all
worlds
shall
i
stand
before
thee
face
to
face
under
thy
great
sky
in
solitude
and
silence
with
humble
heart
shall
i
stand
before
thee
face
to
face
in
this
laborious
world
of
thine
tumultuous
with
toil
and
with
struggle
among
hurrying
crowds
shall
i
stand
before
thee
face
to
face
and
when
my
work
shall
be
done
in
this
world
o
king
of
kings
alone
and
speechless
shall
i
stand
before
thee
face
to
face
i
know
thee
as
my
god
and
stand
apart
i
do
not
know
thee
as
my
own
and
come
closer
i
know
thee
as
my
father
and
bow
before
thy
feet
i
do
not
grasp
thy
hand
as
my
friend
i
stand
not
where
thou
comest
down
and
ownest
thyself
as
mine
there
to
clasp
thee
to
my
heart
and
take
thee
as
my
comrade
thou
art
the
brother
amongst
my
brothers
but
i
heed
them
not
i
divide
not
my
earnings
with
them
thus
sharing
my
all
with
thee
in
pleasure
and
in
pain
i
stand
not
by
the
side
of
men
and
thus
stand
by
thee
i
shrink
to
give
up
my
life
and
thus
do
not
plunge
into
the
great
waters
of
life
when
the
creation
was
new
and
all
the
stars
shone
in
their
first
splendour
the
gods
held
their
assembly
in
the
sky
and
sang
the
picture
of
perfection
the
joy
unalloyed
but
one
cried
of
a
sudden
seems
that
somewhere
there
is
a
break
in
the
chain
of
light
and
one
of
the
stars
has
been
lost
the
golden
string
of
their
harp
snapped
their
song
stopped
and
they
cried
in
dismay
that
lost
star
was
the
best
she
was
the
glory
of
all
heavens
from
that
day
the
search
is
unceasing
for
her
and
the
cry
goes
on
from
one
to
the
other
that
in
her
the
world
has
lost
its
one
joy
only
in
the
deepest
silence
of
night
the
stars
smile
and
whisper
among
themselves
is
this
seeking
unbroken
perfection
is
over
all
if
it
is
not
my
portion
to
meet
thee
in
this
life
then
let
me
ever
feel
that
i
have
missed
thy
sight
let
me
not
forget
for
a
moment
let
me
carry
the
pangs
of
this
sorrow
in
my
dreams
and
in
my
wakeful
hours
as
my
days
pass
in
the
crowded
market
of
this
world
and
my
hands
grow
full
with
the
daily
profits
let
me
ever
feel
that
i
have
gained
nothing
let
me
not
forget
for
a
moment
let
me
carry
the
pangs
of
this
sorrow
in
my
dreams
and
in
my
wakeful
hours
when
i
sit
by
the
roadside
tired
and
panting
when
i
spread
my
bed
low
in
the
dust
let
me
ever
feel
that
the
long
journey
is
still
before
me
let
me
not
forget
a
moment
let
me
carry
the
pangs
of
this
sorrow
in
my
dreams
and
in
my
wakeful
hours
when
my
rooms
have
been
decked
out
and
the
flutes
sound
and
the
laughter
there
is
loud
let
me
ever
feel
that
i
have
not
invited
thee
to
my
house
let
me
not
forget
for
a
moment
let
me
carry
the
pangs
of
this
sorrow
in
my
dreams
and
in
my
wakeful
hours
i
am
like
a
remnant
of
a
cloud
of
autumn
uselessly
roaming
in
the
sky
o
my
sun
thy
touch
has
not
yet
melted
my
vapour
making
me
one
with
thy
light
and
thus
i
count
months
and
years
separated
from
thee
if
this
be
thy
wish
and
if
this
be
thy
play
then
take
this
fleeting
emptiness
of
mine
paint
it
with
colours
gild
it
with
gold
float
it
on
the
wanton
wind
and
spread
it
in
varied
wonders
and
again
when
it
shall
be
thy
wish
to
end
this
play
at
night
i
shall
melt
and
vanish
away
in
the
dark
or
it
may
be
in
a
smile
of
the
white
morning
in
a
coolness
of
purity
transparent
on
many
an
idle
day
have
i
grieved
over
lost
time
but
it
is
never
lost
my
lord
thou
hast
taken
every
moment
of
my
life
in
thine
own
hands
hidden
in
the
heart
of
things
thou
art
nourishing
seeds
into
sprouts
buds
into
blossoms
and
ripening
flowers
into
fruitfulness
i
was
tired
and
sleeping
on
my
idle
bed
and
imagined
all
work
had
ceased
in
the
morning
i
woke
up
and
found
my
garden
full
with
wonders
of
flowers
time
is
endless
in
thy
hands
my
lord
there
is
none
to
count
thy
minutes
days
and
nights
pass
and
ages
bloom
and
fade
like
flowers
thou
knowest
how
to
wait
thy
centuries
follow
each
other
perfecting
a
small
wild
flower
we
have
no
time
to
lose
and
having
no
time
we
must
scramble
for
a
chances
we
are
too
poor
to
be
late
and
thus
it
is
that
time
goes
by
while
i
give
it
to
every
querulous
man
who
claims
it
and
thine
altar
is
empty
of
all
offerings
to
the
last
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
hasten
in
fear
lest
thy
gate
to
be
shut
but
i
find
that
yet
there
is
time
mother
i
shall
weave
a
chain
of
pearls
for
thy
neck
with
my
tears
of
sorrow
the
stars
have
wrought
their
anklets
of
light
to
deck
thy
feet
but
mine
will
hang
upon
thy
breast
wealth
and
fame
come
from
thee
and
it
is
for
thee
to
give
or
to
withhold
them
but
this
my
sorrow
is
absolutely
mine
own
and
when
i
bring
it
to
thee
as
my
offering
thou
rewardest
me
with
thy
grace
it
is
the
pang
of
separation
that
spreads
throughout
the
world
and
gives
birth
to
shapes
innumerable
in
the
infinite
sky
it
is
this
sorrow
of
separation
that
gazes
in
silence
all
nights
from
star
to
star
and
becomes
lyric
among
rustling
leaves
in
rainy
darkness
of
july
it
is
this
overspreading
pain
that
deepens
into
loves
and
desires
into
sufferings
and
joy
in
human
homes
and
this
it
is
that
ever
melts
and
flows
in
songs
through
my
poet
heart
when
the
warriors
came
out
first
from
their
master
hall
where
had
they
hid
their
power
where
were
their
armour
and
their
arms
they
looked
poor
and
helpless
and
the
arrows
were
showered
upon
them
on
the
day
they
came
out
from
their
master
hall
when
the
warriors
marched
back
again
to
their
master
hall
where
did
they
hide
their
power
they
had
dropped
the
sword
and
dropped
the
bow
and
the
arrow
peace
was
on
their
foreheads
and
they
had
left
the
fruits
of
their
life
behind
them
on
the
day
they
marched
back
again
to
their
master
hall
death
thy
servant
is
at
my
door
he
has
crossed
the
unknown
sea
and
brought
thy
call
to
my
home
the
night
is
dark
and
my
heart
is
fearful
yet
i
will
take
up
the
lamp
open
my
gates
and
bow
to
him
my
welcome
it
is
thy
messenger
who
stands
at
my
door
i
will
worship
him
placing
at
his
feet
the
treasure
of
my
heart
he
will
go
back
with
his
errand
done
leaving
a
dark
shadow
on
my
morning
and
in
my
desolate
home
only
my
forlorn
self
will
remain
as
my
last
offering
to
thee
in
desperate
hope
i
go
and
search
for
her
in
all
the
corners
of
my
room
i
find
her
not
my
house
is
small
and
what
once
has
gone
from
it
can
never
be
regained
but
infinite
is
thy
mansion
my
lord
and
seeking
her
i
have
to
come
to
thy
door
i
stand
under
the
golden
canopy
of
thine
evening
sky
and
i
lift
my
eager
eyes
to
thy
face
i
have
come
to
the
brink
of
eternity
from
which
nothing
can
vanish
no
hope
no
happiness
no
vision
of
a
face
seen
through
tears
oh
dip
my
emptied
life
into
that
ocean
plunge
it
into
the
deepest
fullness
let
me
for
once
feel
that
lost
sweet
touch
in
the
allness
of
the
universe
deity
of
the
ruined
temple
the
broken
strings
of
sing
no
more
your
praise
the
bells
in
the
evening
proclaim
not
your
time
of
worship
the
air
is
still
and
silent
about
you
in
your
desolate
dwelling
comes
the
vagrant
spring
breeze
it
brings
the
tidings
of
flowers
the
flowers
that
for
your
worship
are
offered
no
more
your
worshipper
of
old
wanders
ever
longing
for
favour
still
refused
in
the
eventide
when
fires
and
shadows
mingle
with
the
gloom
of
dust
he
wearily
comes
back
to
the
ruined
temple
with
hunger
in
his
heart
many
a
festival
day
comes
to
you
in
silence
deity
of
the
ruined
temple
many
a
night
of
worship
goes
away
with
lamp
unlit
many
new
images
are
built
by
masters
of
cunning
art
and
carried
to
the
holy
stream
of
oblivion
when
their
time
is
come
only
the
deity
of
the
ruined
temple
remains
unworshipped
in
deathless
neglect
no
more
noisy
loud
words
from
me
such
is
my
master
will
henceforth
i
deal
in
whispers
the
speech
of
my
heart
will
be
carried
on
in
murmurings
of
a
song
men
hasten
to
the
king
market
all
the
buyers
and
sellers
are
there
but
i
have
my
untimely
leave
in
the
middle
of
the
day
in
the
thick
of
work
let
then
the
flowers
come
out
in
my
garden
though
it
is
not
their
time
and
let
the
midday
bees
strike
up
their
lazy
hum
full
many
an
hour
have
i
spent
in
the
strife
of
the
good
and
the
evil
but
now
it
is
the
pleasure
of
my
playmate
of
the
empty
days
to
draw
my
heart
on
to
him
and
i
know
not
why
is
this
sudden
call
to
what
useless
inconsequence
on
the
day
when
death
will
knock
at
thy
door
what
wilt
thou
offer
to
him
oh
i
will
set
before
my
guest
the
full
vessel
of
my
life
i
will
never
let
him
go
with
empty
hands
all
the
sweet
vintage
of
all
my
autumn
days
and
summer
nights
all
the
earnings
and
gleanings
of
my
busy
life
will
i
place
before
him
at
the
close
of
my
days
when
death
will
knock
at
my
door
o
thou
the
last
fulfilment
of
life
death
my
death
come
and
whisper
to
me
day
after
day
i
have
kept
watch
for
thee
for
thee
have
i
borne
the
joys
and
pangs
of
life
all
that
i
am
that
i
have
that
i
hope
and
all
my
love
have
ever
flowed
towards
thee
in
depth
of
secrecy
one
final
glance
from
thine
eyes
and
my
life
will
be
ever
thine
own
the
flowers
have
been
woven
and
the
garland
is
ready
for
the
bridegroom
after
the
wedding
the
bride
shall
leave
her
home
and
meet
her
lord
alone
in
the
solitude
of
night
i
know
that
the
day
will
come
when
my
sight
of
this
earth
shall
be
lost
and
life
will
take
its
leave
in
silence
drawing
the
last
curtain
over
my
eyes
yet
stars
will
watch
at
night
and
morning
rise
as
before
and
hours
heave
like
sea
waves
casting
up
pleasures
and
pains
when
i
think
of
this
end
of
my
moments
the
barrier
of
the
moments
breaks
and
i
see
by
the
light
of
death
thy
world
with
its
careless
treasures
rare
is
its
lowliest
seat
rare
is
its
meanest
of
lives
things
that
i
longed
for
in
vain
and
things
that
i
got
let
them
pass
let
me
but
truly
possess
the
things
that
i
ever
spurned
and
overlooked
i
have
got
my
leave
bid
me
farewell
my
brothers
i
bow
to
you
all
and
take
my
departure
here
i
give
back
the
keys
of
my
door
and
i
give
up
all
claims
to
my
house
i
only
ask
for
last
kind
words
from
you
we
were
neighbours
for
long
but
i
received
more
than
i
could
give
now
the
day
has
dawned
and
the
lamp
that
lit
my
dark
corner
is
out
a
summons
has
come
and
i
am
ready
for
my
journey
at
this
time
of
my
parting
wish
me
good
luck
my
friends
the
sky
is
flushed
with
the
dawn
and
my
path
lies
beautiful
ask
not
what
i
have
with
me
to
take
there
i
start
on
my
journey
with
empty
hands
and
expectant
heart
i
shall
put
on
my
wedding
garland
mine
is
not
the
dress
of
the
traveller
and
though
there
are
dangers
on
the
way
i
have
no
fear
in
mind
the
evening
star
will
come
out
when
my
voyage
is
done
and
the
plaintive
notes
of
the
twilight
melodies
be
struck
up
from
the
king
gateway
i
was
not
aware
of
the
moment
when
i
first
crossed
the
threshold
of
this
life
what
was
the
power
that
made
me
open
out
into
this
vast
mystery
like
a
bud
in
the
forest
at
midnight
when
in
the
morning
i
looked
upon
the
light
i
felt
in
a
moment
that
i
was
no
stranger
in
this
world
that
the
inscrutable
without
name
and
form
had
taken
me
in
its
arms
in
the
form
of
my
own
mother
even
so
in
death
the
same
unknown
will
appear
as
ever
known
to
me
and
because
i
love
this
life
i
know
i
shall
love
death
as
well
the
child
cries
out
when
from
the
right
breast
the
mother
takes
it
away
in
the
very
next
moment
to
find
in
the
left
one
its
consolation
when
i
go
from
hence
let
this
be
my
parting
word
that
what
i
have
seen
is
unsurpassable
i
have
tasted
of
the
hidden
honey
of
this
lotus
that
expands
on
the
ocean
of
light
and
thus
am
i
blessed
let
this
be
my
parting
word
in
this
playhouse
of
infinite
forms
i
have
had
my
play
and
here
have
i
caught
sight
of
him
that
is
formless
my
whole
body
and
my
limbs
have
thrilled
with
his
touch
who
is
beyond
touch
and
if
the
end
comes
here
let
it
come
let
this
be
my
parting
word
when
my
play
was
with
thee
i
never
questioned
who
thou
wert
i
knew
nor
shyness
nor
fear
my
life
was
boisterous
in
the
early
morning
thou
wouldst
call
me
from
my
sleep
like
my
own
comrade
and
lead
me
running
from
glade
to
glade
on
those
days
i
never
cared
to
know
the
meaning
of
songs
thou
sangest
to
me
only
my
voice
took
up
the
tunes
and
my
heart
danced
in
their
cadence
now
when
the
playtime
is
over
what
is
this
sudden
sight
that
is
come
upon
me
the
world
with
eyes
bent
upon
thy
feet
stands
in
awe
with
all
its
silent
stars
i
will
deck
thee
with
trophies
garlands
of
my
defeat
it
is
never
in
my
power
to
escape
unconquered
i
surely
know
my
pride
will
go
to
the
wall
my
life
will
burst
its
bonds
in
exceeding
pain
and
my
empty
heart
will
sob
out
in
music
like
a
hollow
reed
and
the
stone
will
melt
in
tears
i
surely
know
the
hundred
petals
of
a
lotus
will
not
remain
closed
for
ever
and
the
secret
recess
of
its
honey
will
be
bared
from
the
blue
sky
an
eye
shall
gaze
upon
me
and
summon
me
in
silence
nothing
will
be
left
for
me
nothing
whatever
and
utter
death
shall
i
receive
at
thy
feet
when
i
give
up
the
helm
i
know
that
the
time
has
come
for
thee
to
take
it
what
there
is
to
do
will
be
instantly
done
vain
is
this
struggle
then
take
away
your
hands
and
silently
put
up
with
your
defeat
my
heart
and
think
it
your
good
fortune
to
sit
perfectly
still
where
you
are
placed
these
my
lamps
are
blown
out
at
every
little
puff
of
wind
and
trying
to
light
them
i
forget
all
else
again
and
again
but
i
shall
be
wise
this
time
and
wait
in
the
dark
spreading
my
mat
on
the
floor
and
whenever
it
is
thy
pleasure
my
lord
come
silently
and
take
thy
seat
here
i
dive
down
into
the
depth
of
the
ocean
of
forms
hoping
to
gain
the
perfect
pearl
of
the
formless
no
more
sailing
from
harbour
to
harbour
with
this
my
boat
the
days
are
long
passed
when
my
sport
was
to
be
tossed
on
waves
and
now
i
am
eager
to
die
into
the
deathless
into
the
audience
hall
by
the
fathomless
abyss
where
swells
up
the
music
of
toneless
strings
i
shall
take
this
harp
of
my
life
i
shall
tune
it
to
the
notes
of
forever
and
when
it
has
sobbed
out
its
last
utterance
lay
down
my
silent
harp
at
the
feet
of
the
silent
ever
in
my
life
have
i
sought
thee
with
my
songs
it
was
they
who
led
me
from
door
to
door
and
with
them
have
i
felt
about
me
searching
and
touching
my
world
it
was
my
songs
that
taught
me
all
the
lessons
i
ever
learnt
they
showed
me
secret
paths
they
brought
before
my
sight
many
a
star
on
the
horizon
of
my
heart
they
guided
me
all
the
day
long
to
the
mysteries
of
the
country
of
pleasure
and
pain
and
at
last
to
what
palace
gate
have
the
brought
me
in
the
evening
at
the
end
of
my
journey
i
boasted
among
men
that
i
had
known
you
they
see
your
pictures
in
all
works
of
mine
they
come
and
ask
me
is
he
i
know
not
how
to
answer
them
i
say
i
can
not
tell
they
blame
me
and
they
go
away
in
scorn
and
you
sit
there
smiling
i
put
my
tales
of
you
into
lasting
songs
the
secret
gushes
out
from
my
heart
they
come
and
ask
me
me
all
your
meanings
i
know
not
how
to
answer
them
i
say
who
knows
what
they
mean
they
smile
and
go
away
in
utter
scorn
and
you
sit
there
smiling
in
one
salutation
to
thee
my
god
let
all
my
senses
spread
out
and
touch
this
world
at
thy
feet
like
a
of
july
hung
low
with
its
burden
of
unshed
showers
let
all
my
mind
bend
down
at
thy
door
in
one
salutation
to
thee
let
all
my
songs
gather
together
their
diverse
strains
into
a
single
current
and
flow
to
a
sea
of
silence
in
one
salutation
to
thee
like
a
flock
of
homesick
cranes
flying
night
and
day
back
to
their
mountain
nests
let
all
my
life
take
its
voyage
to
its
eternal
home
in
one
salutation
to
thee
