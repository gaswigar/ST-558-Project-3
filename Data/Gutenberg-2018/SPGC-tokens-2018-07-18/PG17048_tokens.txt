his
solitary

is
often
in
some
scrape
something
must
have
culminated
the
man
and
the
moment
chapter
i
michael
arranstoun
folded
a
letter
which
he
had
been
reading
for
the
seventh
time
with
a
vicious
intentness
and
then
jumping
up
from
the
big
leather
chair
in
which
he
had
been
buried
he
said
aloud
damn
when
a
young
rich
and
man
says
that
particular
word
aloud
with
a
fearful
grind
of
the
teeth
one
may
know
that
he
is
in
the
very
devil
of
a
temper
michael
arranstoun
was
and
to
be
sure
he
had
ample
reason
as
you
my
friend
who
may
happen
to
have
begun
this
tale
will
presently
see
it
is
really
most
irritating
to
be
suddenly
confronted
with
the
consequences
of
one
follies
at
any
age
but
at
when
otherwise
the
whole
life
is
smiling
for
one
it
seems
quite
too
hard
the
frightful
language
this
young
gentleman
now
indulged
in
half
aloud
and
half
in
thought
would
be
quite
impossible
to
put
on
paper
it
contained
what
almost
amounted
to
curses
for
a
certain
lady
whose
appearance
could
she
have
been
seen
at
this
moment
suggested
that
of
a
pious
little
saint
how
the
h
can
i
keep
from
marrying
her
arranstoun
said
more
than
aloud
this
time
and
then
kicking
an
innocent
footstool
across
the
room
he
called
his
bulldog
put
on
his
cap
and
stamped
out
on
to
the
old
stone
balcony
which
opened
from
this
apartment
and
was
soon
stalking
down
the
staircase
and
across
the
lawn
to
a
little
door
in
the
great
fortified
wall
which
led
into
the
park
he
had
hardly
left
the
room
when
from
the
wide
arched
doorway
of
his
beyond
there
entered
johnson
his
superior
valet
carrying
some
and
a
silk
shirt
over
his
arm
you
could
see
through
the
open
door
that
it
was
a
very
big
and
comfortable
bedroom
which
had
evidently
been
adapted
to
its
present
use
from
some
much
more
stately
beginning
a
large
vaulted
chamber
it
was
with
three
narrow
windows
looking
on
to
the
grim
courtyard
beneath
michael
arranstoun
had
selected
this
particular
suite
for
himself
when
his
father
died
ten
years
before
and
his
mother
was
left
to
spoil
him
until
she
too
departed
from
this
world
when
he
was
sixteen
what
a
splendid
inheritance
he
had
come
into
this
old
border
castle
up
in
the
north
and
not
a
mortgage
on
the
entire
property
while
from
his
mother
a
number
of
solid
golden
sovereigns
flowed
into
his
coffers
every
year
obtained
by
trade
that
was
a
little
disgusting
for
the
arranstouns
but
extremely
useful
it
might
have
been
from
this
same
strain
that
the
fortunate
young
man
had
also
inherited
that
common
sense
which
made
him
fairly
and
not
given
as
a
rule
to
any
taste
the
arranstouns
had
been
at
arranstoun
since
the
time
of
those
tiresome
picts
and
scots
and
for
generations
they
had
raided
their
castles
and
lands
and
carried
off
their
cattle
and
wives
and
daughters
and
what
not
they
had
seized
anything
they
fancied
and
were
a
strong
ruthless
brutal
race
not
much
vitiated
by
civilization
these
instincts
of
seizing
what
they
wanted
had
gone
on
in
them
throughout
eleven
hundred
years
and
more
and
were
there
until
this
day
when
michael
the
sole
representative
of
this
branch
of
the
family
said
damn
and
kicked
a
footstool
across
the
room
into
the
grate
johnson
was
quite
aware
of
the
peculiarity
of
the
family
indeed
he
was
not
surprised
when
alexander
armstrong
remarked
upon
it
presently
alexander
armstrong
was
the
old
retainer
who
now
enjoyed
the
position
of
guide
to
the
castle
upon
the
two
days
a
week
when
tourists
were
allowed
to
walk
through
the
state
rooms
and
look
at
the
splendid
carvings
and
armor
and
pictures
and
the
collection
of
plate
johnson
had
had
time
to
glance
over
his
master
correspondence
that
morning
which
with
characteristic
recklessness
that
gentleman
had
left
upon
his
bed
while
he
went
to
his
bath
so
his
servant
knew
the
cause
of
his
bad
temper
and
had
been
prudent
and
kept
a
good
deal
out
of
the
way
but
the
news
was
so
interesting
he
felt
alexander
armstrong
really
ought
to
share
the
thrill
hatfield
husband
is
dying
he
announced
as
armstrong
very
diffidently
peeped
through
the
window
from
the
balcony
and
then
seeing
no
one
but
his
friend
the
valet
entered
the
room
alexander
armstrong
spoke
in
broad
scotch
but
i
shall
not
attempt
to
transcribe
this
barbaric
language
sufficient
to
tell
you
that
he
made
the
excuse
for
his
intrusion
by
saying
that
he
had
wanted
to
get
some
order
from
the
master
about
the
tourists
we
sha
have
any
tourists
when
she
installed
here
as
mistress
johnson
remarked
sepulchrally
armstrong
was
heard
to
murmur
that
he
did
not
know
what
johnson
meant
this
was
too
stupid
why
i
told
you
straight
off
hatfield
husband
is
dying
johnson
exclaimed
contemptuously
she
wrote
one
of
her
mauve
billy
doos
this
morning
telling
the
master
so
and
suggesting
they
soon
be
able
to
be
married
and
happy
pretty
i
call
it
considering
the
poor
man
is
not
yet
in
his
grave
armstrong
was
almost
knocked
over
by
this
statement
then
he
laughed
and
what
he
said
meant
in
plain
english
that
johnson
need
not
worry
himself
for
no
arranstoun
had
ever
been
known
to
be
coerced
into
any
course
of
conduct
which
he
did
not
desire
himself
not
being
hampered
by
consideration
for
women
or
by
any
consideration
but
his
own
will
for
the
matter
of
that
a
headstrong
ruthless
race
all
of
them
and
as
johnson
must
be
very
well
aware
their
own
particular
master
was
a
true
chip
of
the
old
block
see
his
bonny
blue
eye
i
think
he
pronounced
it
ee
see
his
mouth
shut
like
a
game
spring
see
his
strong
arms
and
his
height
see
him
smash
the
boughs
off
trees
when
they
get
in
his
way
and
then
tell
me
a
woman
going
to
get
dominion
over
him
go
along
mr
johnson
but
johnson
remained
unconvinced
and
troubled
he
had
had
several
unpleasant
proofs
of
woman
infernal
cunning
in
his
own
sphere
of
life
and
hatfield
he
knew
was
as
well
endowed
with
eve
wit
as
any
french
maid
we
ha
a
bet
about
it
if
you
like
armstrong
remarked
as
he
got
up
to
go
the
clock
striking
three
he
knew
the
first
batch
of
afternoon
tourists
would
be
clamoring
at
the
gate
johnson
looked
at
the
in
his
hand
he
went
straight
off
for
his
ride
without
tasting
a
bite
of
breakfast
or
seeing
fordyce
and
he
did
return
to
lunch
and
just
now
i
find
every
article
of
clothing
strewn
upon
the
floor
when
he
came
in
and
took
another
bath
he
did
not
even
ring
for
me
he
must
have
galloped
all
the
time
his
temper
would
frighten
a
fighting
cock
meanwhile
michael
arranstoun
was
tramping
his
park
with
giant
strides
and
suddenly
came
upon
his
friend
and
guest
henry
fordyce
whose
very
presence
in
his
house
he
had
forgotten
so
turbulent
had
his
thoughts
been
ever
since
the
early
post
came
in
henry
fordyce
was
a
leisurely
creature
and
had
come
out
for
a
stroll
on
the
exquisite
june
day
upon
his
own
account
they
exchanged
a
few
remarks
and
gradually
got
back
to
again
and
rang
for
drinks
fordyce
had
by
this
time
become
quite
aware
that
an
active
volcano
was
going
on
in
his
friend
but
had
waited
for
the
first
indication
of
the
cause
it
came
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
after
the
footman
had
left
the
room
and
both
men
were
reclining
in
big
chairs
with
their
iced
whiskey
and
soda
it
is
a
shame
to
stay
indoors
on
such
a
day
henry
said
lazily
looking
out
upon
the
balcony
and
the
glittering
sunshine
i
never
saw
anyone
enjoy
a
holiday
like
you
do
henry
michael
retorted
petulantly
i
ca
enjoy
anything
lately
my
soul
it
is
worth
going
into
parliament
to
get
such
an
amount
of
pleasure
out
of
a
week
freedom
but
henry
did
not
agree
that
it
was
freedom
when
even
here
at
arranstoun
he
had
been
pestered
to
patronize
the
local
bazaar
the
penalty
of
greatness
i
wonder
when
you
will
be
prime
minister
lord
what
a
grind
fordyce
stretched
himself
in
his
chair
and
lit
a
cigar
it
may
be
a
grind
he
said
meditatively
but
it
is
for
some
definite
idea
of
good
even
if
i
am
a
slave
whereas
you
you
are
tied
and
bound
to
a
woman
and
such
a
woman
you
have
not
been
able
to
call
your
soul
your
own
since
last
october
as
it
is
and
before
you
know
where
you
are
you
will
be
attending
the
husband
funeral
and
your
own
wedding
in
the
same
week
michael
bounded
from
his
chair
with
an
oath
i
be
shot
if
i
do
he
said
and
sat
down
again
then
his
voice
grew
a
little
uncertain
and
he
went
on
it
is
worrying
me
awfully
though
henry
if
poor
old
maurice
does
puff
out
i
suppose
i
ought
to
marry
her
i
fordyce
stiffened
and
the
sleepy
look
in
his
gray
eyes
altered
to
a
flash
of
steel
let
us
have
a
little
plain
speaking
michael
old
boy
it
is
not
as
though
i
do
not
know
the
whole
circumstance
of
your
affair
with
violet
hatfield
i
warned
you
about
her
in
the
beginning
when
you
met
her
at
my
sister
rose
but
as
usual
you
would
take
your
own
course
michael
began
to
speak
but
checked
himself
and
henry
fordyce
went
on
i
have
had
a
letter
from
rose
this
morning
as
you
of
course
know
violet
is
staying
for
this
whitsuntide
with
them
having
dragged
her
wretched
husband
dying
of
consumption
as
he
is
to
this
merry
party
well
rose
says
poor
maurice
is
in
a
terrible
state
caught
a
fresh
cold
on
saturday
and
she
adds
i
suppose
we
shall
soon
see
violet
installed
at
arranstoun
as
mistress
i
know
i
heard
from
violet
herself
this
morning
and
michael
put
his
head
down
dejectedly
ebbsworth
is
only
miles
from
here
fordyce
announced
with
meaning
violet
can
pop
in
on
you
at
any
moment
and
she
clinch
the
matter
and
bind
you
with
her
cobwebs
before
you
can
escape
oh
lord
you
know
you
are
dead
sick
of
her
michael
and
you
know
that
i
am
not
the
sort
of
man
who
would
ever
speak
of
a
woman
thus
without
grave
reason
but
she
does
not
care
for
you
any
more
than
the
half
a
dozen
others
who
occupied
your
proud
position
before
your
day
it
is
only
for
money
and
the
glory
of
having
you
tied
to
her
apron
strings
it
was
not
any
good
hammering
on
while
the
passion
was
upon
you
but
i
have
watched
you
and
have
seen
that
it
is
waning
so
now
my
time
with
this
danger
in
front
of
you
you
have
got
to
pull
yourself
together
old
boy
and
cut
and
run
that
would
be
no
use
then
michael
stammered
a
little
i
say
henry
i
wo
hear
a
word
against
her
you
can
thunder
at
me
but
leave
her
out
fordyce
smiled
did
she
express
deep
grief
at
poor
maurice
condition
in
her
letter
he
asked
er
no
not
exactly
i
thought
not
she
probably
suggested
all
sorts
of
joys
with
you
when
she
is
free
there
was
an
ominous
silence
fordyce
voice
now
took
on
that
crisp
tone
which
his
adversaries
in
the
house
of
commons
so
well
knew
meant
that
they
must
look
to
their
guns
delightful
woman
a
spider
i
tell
you
a
roaring
hypocrite
too
bamboozling
poor
rose
into
thinking
her
a
virtuous
persecuted
little
darling
with
a
noble
passion
for
you
and
my
sister
is
a
downright
person
not
easily
fooled
at
this
moment
violet
is
probably
shedding
tears
on
her
shoulder
over
poor
maurice
while
she
is
plotting
how
soon
she
can
become
mistress
of
arranstoun
good
god
when
i
think
of
it
i
would
rather
get
in
a
girl
from
the
village
and
go
through
the
ceremony
with
her
and
make
myself
safe
than
have
the
prospect
of
violet
hatfield
as
a
wife
michael
i
tell
you
seriously
dear
boy
you
have
the
ghost
of
a
chance
if
you
are
still
unmarried
when
poor
maurice
dies
michael
bounded
from
his
chair
once
more
he
was
perfectly
furious
furious
with
the
situation
furious
with
the
woman
furious
with
himself
confound
it
henry
i
know
it
but
it
does
not
mend
matters
your
ranting
there
and
i
am
so
sorry
for
the
poor
chap
maurice
i
mean
a
very
decent
fellow
poor
maurice
ca
you
suggest
any
way
out
fordyce
mused
a
moment
while
he
deliberately
puffed
smoke
michael
impatience
increasing
so
that
he
ran
his
hands
through
his
dark
smooth
hair
whose
shiny
immaculate
brushing
was
usually
his
pride
ca
you
suggest
a
way
out
he
reiterated
fordyce
did
not
reply
then
after
a
moment
you
were
always
too
much
occupied
with
women
michael
from
your
first
scrape
when
you
left
eton
and
over
this
affair
you
have
been
a
complete
fool
michael
was
heard
to
swear
again
you
have
been
inconsistent
too
because
you
did
not
even
employ
your
usual
ruthless
methods
of
doing
what
you
pleased
with
them
you
have
simply
drifted
into
allowing
this
vile
creature
cobwebs
to
cling
on
to
your
whole
existence
until
you
are
almost
paralyzed
and
it
seems
to
me
that
an
immediate
marriage
with
someone
else
is
your
only
way
of
escape
such
a
waste
of
your
life
just
analyze
the
position
you
have
everything
in
the
world
this
glorious
place
an
old
name
money
prestige
and
if
your
inclinations
do
run
to
the
material
side
of
things
instead
of
the
intellectual
they
are
still
successful
in
their
demonstration
no
one
has
a
better
eye
for
a
horse
or
is
a
finer
shot
the
best
at
driven
grouse
for
your
age
my
boy
i
have
ever
seen
you
are
full
of
force
michael
and
ought
to
do
some
decent
thing
instead
of
which
you
spoil
the
whole
outlook
by
fooling
after
this
infernal
woman
and
you
have
not
now
the
pluck
to
cut
the
gordian
knot
she
will
drag
you
to
the
lowest
depths
then
he
laughed
and
only
think
of
that
voice
in
one
ears
all
day
long
i
would
rather
marry
old
bessie
at
the
south
lodge
she
is
she
tells
me
and
would
soon
leave
you
a
widower
the
first
ray
of
hope
shot
into
michael
bright
blue
eyes
and
he
exclaimed
with
a
kind
of
joy
as
he
seized
binko
his
bulldog
by
his
fat
engaging
throat
bessie
old
bessie
by
jove
what
an
idea
the
very
thing
she
do
it
for
me
like
a
shot
dear
old
body
binko
gurgled
and
slobbered
in
sympathy
she
would
be
kind
to
you
too
binko
she
would
not
say
she
found
your
hairs
on
every
chair
and
that
you
dribbled
on
her
dress
she
would
not
tell
your
master
that
he
left
his
about
and
she
hated
the
smell
of
smoke
she
would
not
want
this
room
for
her
boudoir
she
then
he
stopped
his
flow
of
words
suddenly
catching
sight
of
the
whimsical
sardonic
smile
upon
his
friend
face
oh
lord
he
mumbled
contritely
i
had
forgotten
you
were
here
henry
i
am
so
jolly
upset
this
heartlessness
about
poor
maurice
has
finished
you
eh
fordyce
suggested
he
felt
he
might
be
gaining
his
end
michael
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
it
seems
so
ghastly
to
think
of
marriage
with
the
poor
chap
not
yet
dead
i
am
fairly
knocked
over
it
really
is
the
last
straw
but
she
will
cry
and
make
a
scene
and
she
has
certainly
arguments
and
it
will
make
one
feel
such
a
cad
to
leave
her
she
wrote
that
did
she
wrote
of
marriage
and
her
husband
last
attack
of
hemorrhage
in
the
same
paragraph
i
suppose
michael
it
is
revolting
my
dear
boy
you
must
break
away
from
her
and
then
do
try
to
occupy
yourself
with
more
important
things
than
women
believe
me
they
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
and
in
their
proper
place
to
be
treated
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
respect
as
wives
and
mothers
even
loved
if
you
will
for
a
recreation
but
as
vital
factors
in
a
man
real
life
my
dear
fellow
the
idea
is
ridiculous
that
life
should
be
for
his
country
and
the
development
of
his
own
soul
michael
arranstoun
laughed
jolly
old
mohammedan
you
think
women
have
none
i
suppose
henry
fordyce
frowned
because
it
was
rather
true
but
he
denied
the
charge
nothing
of
the
sort
merely
i
see
things
at
their
proper
balance
and
you
can
not
michael
leaned
back
in
his
chair
he
was
quieter
for
a
moment
i
only
see
what
i
want
to
see
henry
and
i
am
a
savage
i
can
not
help
it
we
have
always
been
so
when
i
fancy
a
woman
i
must
obtain
her
when
i
want
a
horse
i
must
have
it
it
is
always
and
we
have
not
done
so
badly
we
still
possess
our
shoulders
and
chins
and
strength
after
eleven
hundred
years
of
it
and
he
stretched
out
a
splendid
arm
with
a
force
which
could
have
felled
an
ox
an
undoubtedly
fine
specimen
of
british
manhood
he
looked
sitting
there
in
the
june
sunlight
which
came
in
a
shaft
from
the
south
mullioned
window
in
the
corner
beyond
the
great
fireplace
the
space
between
occupied
by
a
large
picture
of
uncertain
date
depicting
the
landing
of
mary
queen
of
scots
in
her
northern
kingdom
his
eyes
roamed
to
this
one
of
my
ancestors
was
among
that
party
he
said
pointing
to
a
figure
he
had
just
killed
a
moreton
and
stolen
his
wife
that
is
why
he
looks
so
perky
the
fellow
in
the
blue
doublet
fordyce
rose
from
his
chair
and
fired
his
last
shot
and
now
a
female
spider
is
going
to
paralyze
the
last
arranstoun
and
rule
him
for
the
rest
of
his
days
sapping
his
vitality
but
michael
protested
by
heaven
no
well
i
leave
you
to
think
about
it
i
am
going
for
another
stroll
on
this
lovely
day
he
had
got
to
the
window
by
this
time
which
looked
into
the
courtyard
on
the
opposite
side
to
the
balcony
goodness
what
a
party
of
tourists
it
is
a
bore
for
you
to
have
them
all
over
the
place
like
this
to
own
a
castle
with
state
rooms
to
be
shown
to
the
public
has
its
disadvantages
michael
looked
at
them
too
a
large
party
of
americans
mostly
of
that
class
which
compose
the
tourists
of
all
countries
and
which
no
nation
feels
proud
to
own
he
had
seen
hundreds
of
such
and
turned
away
indifferently
they
only
come
here
twice
a
week
and
it
has
been
allowed
for
such
ages
they
are
generally
quiet
and
fortunately
their
perambulations
close
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
they
do
intrude
upon
my
own
suite
they
get
to
the
chapel
by
the
outside
door
henry
crossed
the
room
and
went
on
to
the
balcony
hatfield
will
alter
all
that
he
laughed
as
he
disappeared
from
view
michael
flashed
a
rageful
glance
at
his
back
and
then
flung
himself
into
his
great
armchair
again
and
pulled
the
wrinkled
mass
which
called
itself
a
prize
bulldog
on
to
his
lap
i
believe
he
right
and
we
are
caught
binko
if
we
fled
to
the
rocky
mountains
she
would
track
us
if
we
stay
and
face
it
she
make
an
almighty
scandal
and
force
us
to
marry
her
what
in
the
devil
name
are
we
to
do
binko
licked
his
master
hands
and
made
noises
so
full
of
gurgling
slobbering
sympathy
no
heart
could
have
remained
uncomforted
who
knows
his
canine
common
sense
may
have
telepathically
transmitted
a
thought
for
michael
suddenly
plopped
him
on
the
floor
and
stalked
toward
the
fireplace
to
ring
the
bell
while
he
exclaimed
as
though
answering
a
suggestion
yes
we
send
for
old
bessie
that
the
only
way
but
before
he
could
reach
his
goal
the
picture
of
mary
queen
of
scots
landing
fell
forward
with
a
crash
and
through
the
aperture
of
a
secret
door
which
it
concealed
there
tumbled
a
very
young
and
pretty
girl
right
into
the
room
chapter
ii
arranstoun
was
extremely
startled
and
annoyed
too
and
before
he
took
in
the
situation
he
had
exclaimed
while
binko
gave
an
ominous
growl
of
displeasure
confound
it
who
is
that
these
are
private
rooms
then
seeing
it
was
a
girl
on
the
floor
he
said
in
another
voice
quiet
binko
and
the
dog
retired
to
his
own
basket
under
a
distant
table
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
but
the
creature
on
the
floor
blinked
at
michael
with
large
round
violet
eyes
but
did
not
move
while
she
answered
aggrievedly
with
a
very
faint
accent
whether
a
little
french
or
a
little
american
or
a
little
of
both
he
was
not
sure
only
that
it
had
something
attractive
about
it
you
may
well
say
i
did
not
mean
to
intrude
upon
your
private
room
but
i
had
to
run
away
from
greenbank
he
was
so
horrid
here
she
gasped
a
little
for
breath
and
i
happened
to
see
something
like
a
door
ajar
in
the
gainsborough
room
so
i
fled
through
it
and
it
fastened
after
me
with
a
snap
i
could
not
open
it
again
and
it
was
pitch
dark
in
that
dreadful
passage
and
not
a
scrap
of
air
i
felt
suffocated
and
i
pushed
on
anywhere
and
something
gave
way
and
i
fell
in
here
that
all
she
rattled
this
out
without
a
stop
and
then
stared
at
michael
with
her
big
childish
eyes
but
did
not
attempt
to
rise
from
the
floor
he
walked
toward
her
and
held
out
his
hand
and
with
ceremonious
and
ironical
politeness
he
began
may
i
not
help
you
i
could
offer
you
a
chair
she
interrupted
him
while
she
struggled
up
refusing
his
proffered
hand
i
knocked
myself
against
your
nasty
table
why
do
you
have
it
in
that
place
michael
sat
down
upon
the
edge
of
it
and
went
on
in
his
ironical
tone
had
i
known
i
was
to
have
the
honor
of
this
visit
i
should
certainly
have
had
it
moved
there
is
no
use
being
sarcastic
the
girl
said
almost
crying
now
it
hurts
very
much
and
and
i
want
to
go
home
arranstoun
pushed
a
comfortable
monster
seat
toward
her
and
said
more
sympathetically
i
am
very
sorry
but
where
is
home
the
girl
sank
into
the
chair
and
smoothed
out
her
pink
cotton
frock
the
skimpy
skirt
not
as
narrow
as
in
these
days
but
still
short
and
spare
showed
a
perfect
pair
of
feet
and
ankles
she
american
of
course
then
michael
said
to
himself
observing
these
and
quite
pretty
if
that
smudge
of
grime
was
off
her
face
she
was
looking
at
him
now
with
her
large
innocent
eyes
which
contained
no
shadow
of
over
the
unusual
situation
and
then
she
answered
quite
simply
i
have
a
home
you
know
i
just
staying
at
the
inn
with
uncle
mortimer
and
aunt
jemima
and
and
greenbank
and
we
are
tourists
i
suppose
and
were
looking
at
the
pictures
when
when
i
had
to
run
away
michael
felt
a
little
piqued
with
curiosity
she
was
a
diversion
after
his
perplexing
irritating
meditations
it
would
be
so
interesting
to
hear
why
you
ran
away
the
whole
story
he
suggested
the
girl
turned
her
head
and
looked
out
of
the
window
showing
a
dear
little
baby
profile
and
masses
of
light
brown
hair
rolled
up
anyhow
at
the
back
she
did
not
look
older
than
seventeen
at
the
outside
and
was
peculiarly
childish
and
slender
for
that
but
i
should
have
to
tell
you
from
the
beginning
and
it
is
so
long
and
you
are
a
stranger
michael
drew
another
chair
nearer
to
her
and
sat
down
while
his
manner
took
on
a
note
of
grave
elderly
concern
which
rather
belied
the
twinkle
of
mischief
in
his
eyes
never
mind
that
i
am
sympathetic
and
i
am
your
host
and
by
jove
wo
you
have
some
tea
you
look
awfully
tired
and
dusty
and
he
rang
the
bell
and
then
reseated
himself
see
to
be
quite
orthodox
we
will
make
our
own
introduction
i
am
michael
arranstoun
and
you
are
the
girl
rose
and
made
him
a
polite
bow
i
am
sabine
delburg
she
announced
he
bowed
also
and
then
she
went
into
a
peal
of
silvery
laughter
that
seemed
to
contain
all
the
glad
notes
of
spring
and
youth
oh
this
is
fun
and
i
i
should
like
some
tea
she
caught
sight
of
herself
in
an
old
mirror
which
stood
upon
a
commode
goodness
what
a
guy
i
look
why
did
you
tell
me
that
my
hat
was
crooked
she
settled
it
straight
and
began
searching
for
a
handkerchief
up
her
sleeve
and
in
her
belt
but
none
was
to
be
found
so
arranstoun
handed
her
a
clean
one
he
chanced
to
have
in
his
pocket
i
expect
you
want
to
wipe
the
smudge
of
dirt
off
your
face
he
hazarded
she
took
it
laughing
and
showing
an
even
row
of
beautiful
teeth
between
red
full
baby
lips
you
are
the
owner
of
this
castle
she
went
on
as
she
gave
firm
rubs
at
the
velvet
pink
cheeks
that
must
be
nice
you
can
do
what
you
like
i
suppose
and
here
a
sigh
of
regret
escaped
and
made
her
voice
lower
i
wish
i
arranstoun
answered
feelingly
well
if
i
were
i
would
what
would
you
do
she
turned
and
faced
him
while
she
said
with
extreme
solemnity
i
should
never
marry
mr
greenbank
michael
laughed
i
do
suppose
you
would
if
you
were
a
man
at
this
moment
a
footman
answered
the
bell
bring
tea
please
his
master
ordered
inwardly
amused
at
the
servant
astonished
face
and
then
when
they
were
alone
again
he
continued
his
sympathetic
questioning
who
is
greenbank
you
had
to
flee
from
him
you
said
he
was
horrid
i
believe
miss
delburg
had
removed
her
hat
and
was
trying
to
tidy
her
hair
before
readjusting
it
she
had
the
in
her
mouth
but
took
it
out
to
answer
vehemently
so
he
is
a
pig
and
i
went
and
got
engaged
to
him
this
morning
you
see
turning
to
the
glass
again
quite
unembarrassed
i
ca
get
my
money
until
i
am
married
and
uncle
is
so
disagreeable
and
aunt
jemima
nags
all
day
long
and
it
was
left
in
papa
will
that
i
was
to
live
with
them
and
i
do
come
of
age
until
i
am
but
i
can
get
the
money
directly
if
i
marry
i
was
seventeen
in
may
and
of
course
no
one
could
stand
it
till
greenbank
is
the
only
person
who
has
asked
me
and
aunt
jemima
says
no
one
else
ever
will
i
have
been
out
of
the
convent
for
a
whole
month
and
i
ca
bear
it
michael
was
beginning
really
to
enjoy
himself
she
was
something
so
fresh
so
entirely
different
to
anything
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
before
there
was
nothing
of
shyness
or
awkwardness
in
her
manner
as
any
english
girl
would
have
shown
she
was
absolutely
at
ease
with
a
childish
confiding
innocence
which
he
saw
plainly
was
real
and
not
put
on
for
his
benefit
it
was
almost
incredible
in
these
days
a
most
engaging
morsel
of
seventeen
summers
he
decided
as
he
answered
with
concern
what
a
hard
fate
but
you
have
not
told
me
yet
why
you
ran
away
the
girl
had
finished
her
toilet
by
now
and
reseated
herself
with
a
air
in
the
big
armchair
oh
well
he
was
just
horrid
that
was
all
and
then
abruptly
turning
the
conversation
it
is
a
nice
place
you
have
here
and
it
does
feel
lovely
doing
something
wrong
like
this
having
tea
with
you
i
mean
you
know
i
have
never
spoken
to
a
young
man
before
the
nuns
always
told
us
they
were
dreadful
creatures
but
you
do
look
so
bad
and
she
examined
her
host
critically
michael
accepted
the
implied
appreciation
what
is
greenbank
then
the
silver
laugh
rang
out
again
while
she
jumped
up
and
peeped
from
the
window
into
the
courtyard
samuel
he
only
a
thing
oh
uncle
and
aunt
would
be
so
angry
if
they
could
see
me
here
and
i
expect
they
are
all
in
a
fine
fuss
now
to
know
what
has
happened
to
me
they
never
saw
me
go
through
the
door
and
i
hope
they
think
that
i
committed
suicide
out
of
one
of
the
windows
look
and
she
danced
excitedly
there
is
uncle
talking
to
the
commissionaire
oh
what
fun
arranstoun
peeped
too
and
saw
a
spare
elderly
american
of
grim
appearance
in
anxious
confab
with
alexander
armstrong
the
whole
situation
struck
him
as
delightful
and
he
laughed
gaily
while
he
suggested
you
are
perhaps
rather
a
difficult
charge
miss
delburg
resented
this
at
once
what
an
idea
how
would
you
like
to
marry
greenbank
or
stay
with
aunt
jemima
for
four
years
well
you
see
i
ca
contemplate
it
as
i
am
not
a
girl
again
those
white
teeth
showed
and
the
violet
eyes
were
suffused
with
laughter
no
of
course
not
how
silly
i
am
but
i
mean
how
would
you
care
to
be
forced
to
do
something
you
did
not
like
michael
thought
of
his
own
fate
by
jove
i
should
hate
it
well
you
can
understand
me
then
the
door
opened
and
the
butler
and
footman
brought
in
the
tea
eyeing
their
master
guest
furtively
while
they
maintained
that
superbly
aloof
manner
of
english
servants
the
pause
their
entrance
caused
gave
arranstoun
time
to
think
and
an
idea
gradually
began
to
unfold
itself
in
his
brain
and
unconsciously
he
took
out
and
then
replaced
in
his
breast
pocket
a
mauve
letter
while
a
frown
of
deep
cogitation
crept
over
his
face
miss
delburg
for
her
part
was
only
thrilled
with
the
sight
of
the
very
agreeable
tea
and
after
waiting
a
moment
to
see
what
her
preoccupied
host
would
do
when
the
servants
left
the
room
hunger
forced
her
to
fall
to
the
temptation
of
a
particularly
appetizing
chocolate
cake
which
she
surreptitiously
seized
and
began
munching
with
the
frank
joy
of
a
child
i
do
love
them
she
sighed
and
we
never
were
allowed
them
only
once
a
month
after
moravia
cloudwater
got
that
awful
toothache
and
had
to
have
a
big
grinder
pulled
out
michael
was
paying
no
attention
to
her
he
had
walked
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
once
or
twice
much
to
her
astonishment
at
last
he
spoke
i
have
an
idea
but
first
let
me
give
you
some
tea
no
do
help
yourself
then
he
paused
awkwardly
and
she
at
once
proceeded
to
fill
her
cup
binko
had
condescended
to
emerge
from
his
basket
under
the
table
was
an
hour
when
he
allowed
himself
to
take
an
interest
in
human
beings
oh
you
darling
the
girl
cried
putting
down
her
cup
you
fat
lovely
wrinkly
darling
he
is
a
nice
dog
his
master
admitted
his
voice
was
actually
nervous
and
he
pulled
binko
to
him
by
his
solid
fleshy
paws
while
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
again
miss
delburg
had
got
back
into
her
seat
where
she
munched
a
cake
and
continued
her
tea
the
chair
was
so
deep
and
long
that
her
little
bits
of
feet
did
not
nearly
reach
the
ground
but
dangled
there
may
i
pour
you
out
some
too
she
asked
getting
forward
again
i
do
love
to
pour
out
and
do
you
take
sugar
i
like
lumps
and
lumps
of
it
oh
er
yes
michael
agreed
absently
and
then
he
went
on
with
the
determined
air
of
a
person
getting
something
off
his
chest
i
hardly
know
how
to
say
what
i
am
thinking
of
it
sounds
so
strange
listen
i
also
must
marry
someone
anyone
to
avert
a
fate
i
do
want
what
do
you
say
to
marrying
the
teapot
came
down
into
the
tray
with
a
bump
while
the
round
childish
eyes
grew
like
saucers
with
astonishment
oh
i
dare
say
it
does
surprise
you
michael
then
hastened
to
add
i
mean
we
should
only
go
through
the
ceremony
of
course
and
you
could
get
your
money
and
i
my
freedom
the
girl
clasped
her
hands
round
her
knees
and
i
should
never
have
to
see
you
again
in
a
glad
voice
of
comprehension
michael
leaned
forward
nearer
to
her
well
no
never
unless
you
wished
miss
delburg
actually
kicked
her
feet
with
delight
it
is
a
perfectly
splendid
suggestion
she
announced
we
could
just
oblige
one
another
in
this
way
and
need
never
see
or
speak
to
each
other
again
what
made
it
come
into
your
head
do
you
really
think
we
could
do
that
oh
how
rude
of
me
i
forgotten
to
pour
out
your
tea
never
mind
talking
about
our
marriage
is
more
interesting
and
arranstoun
blue
eyes
filled
with
mischievous
appreciation
of
the
situation
even
beyond
the
seriousness
of
the
discussion
he
meant
to
carry
to
an
end
but
this
aspect
did
not
so
much
concern
miss
delburg
as
that
she
had
let
slip
a
particular
pleasure
for
the
moment
that
of
being
allowed
a
teapot
in
her
own
hand
instead
of
being
given
a
huge
bowl
of
milk
with
a
drop
of
weak
coffee
mixed
in
it
and
watching
a
like
fate
fall
upon
her
companions
when
this
delightful
business
was
accomplished
to
her
satisfaction
her
sweet
little
round
face
a
model
of
serious
responsibility
the
while
she
handed
michael
the
cup
and
drew
herself
back
once
more
into
the
depth
of
the
giant
chair
i
ca
behave
nicely
in
this
great
creature
she
said
patting
the
fat
cushioned
arms
and
the
mother
superior
would
be
horribly
shocked
but
do
let
mind
now
do
tell
me
something
about
this
plan
you
see
gravely
i
really
do
know
the
world
very
well
yet
i
have
always
been
at
the
convent
near
tours
until
a
month
ago
even
in
the
holidays
since
i
was
seven
and
the
sisters
never
told
me
anything
about
outside
except
that
it
was
a
place
of
pitfalls
and
that
men
were
dreadful
creatures
i
was
very
happy
there
except
i
wanted
to
get
out
all
the
time
and
when
i
did
and
found
uncle
and
aunt
more
tiresome
than
the
sisters
there
seemed
no
help
for
it
only
greenbank
so
i
accepted
him
this
morning
but
and
this
awful
thought
caused
her
whole
countenance
to
change
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
the
usual
getting
married
means
you
would
have
to
stay
with
the
man
would
you
and
he
wants
he
wants
to
kiss
i
mean
hurriedly
you
would
be
lovely
to
marry
because
i
would
never
have
to
see
you
again
michael
arranstoun
put
his
head
back
and
laughed
she
was
perfectly
delicious
he
began
to
dislike
greenbank
his
tea
was
quite
forgotten
er
of
course
not
he
agreed
well
i
could
get
a
special
license
if
you
could
tell
me
exactly
how
you
stand
and
your
whole
name
and
your
parents
names
and
everything
and
we
could
get
their
consent
but
i
conclude
your
father
at
least
is
no
longer
alive
miss
delburg
had
a
very
air
now
no
my
parents
are
both
dead
she
told
him
papa
three
years
ago
and
mamma
for
ages
and
i
never
saw
them
much
anyhow
they
were
always
travelling
about
and
mamma
was
a
frenchwoman
and
a
catholic
her
family
did
not
speak
to
her
because
she
married
a
protestant
and
an
american
and
the
worry
it
was
for
me
being
brought
up
in
a
convent
because
papa
would
have
me
a
protestant
so
i
do
believe
i
have
got
a
little
religion
of
my
own
that
is
not
like
either
yes
she
continued
her
narrative
in
the
intervals
of
the
joy
of
munching
another
cake
papa
was
very
rich
and
it
all
mine
only
it
appears
he
did
not
approve
of
the
freedom
of
american
women
and
so
tied
it
up
so
that
i
ca
get
it
until
i
am
an
old
maid
of
or
get
married
is
it
not
disgusting
michael
thoughts
were
now
concentrating
upon
the
vital
points
but
have
you
not
got
a
guardian
or
something
not
exactly
only
an
old
lawyer
person
who
is
now
in
london
i
have
seen
papa
will
and
i
know
i
can
marry
when
and
whom
i
like
if
i
get
his
consent
and
he
would
give
it
in
a
minute
he
is
sick
of
me
how
fortunate
then
restlessness
seized
him
again
and
he
got
up
gulped
down
his
tea
and
began
his
pacing
i
do
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
and
we
must
do
it
if
we
can
get
this
person
leave
yes
and
do
it
quickly
before
we
change
our
minds
or
something
interferes
everyone
would
think
we
were
perfectly
mad
but
as
it
suits
us
both
that
is
no
one
business
only
you
are
rather
young
and
er
i
do
know
greenbank
you
are
sure
he
is
horrid
the
girl
clasped
her
hands
together
with
force
sure
i
should
think
so
he
wears
glasses
and
has
nasty
scrabbly
bits
of
fur
on
his
face
which
he
thinks
is
a
beard
and
he
is
pompous
and
he
talks
like
this
and
she
imitated
a
precise
boston
voice
dear
sabine
have
you
considered
and
he
is
lanky
and
oh
i
detest
him
and
i
ca
imagine
why
i
ever
said
i
would
marry
him
but
if
i
do
what
i
to
do
with
aunt
jemima
for
four
years
i
should
die
of
it
michael
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
looked
at
her
long
and
deeply
he
took
in
the
childish
picture
she
made
in
the
big
chair
he
had
no
definite
appreciation
then
of
her
charm
his
mind
was
too
fixed
upon
what
seemed
a
prospect
of
certain
escape
from
violet
hatfield
and
her
cunning
thirty
years
of
experience
this
young
thing
could
not
interfere
with
him
and
divorces
in
scotland
were
not
impossible
things
they
would
both
gain
what
they
wanted
for
the
time
and
it
was
a
fair
bargain
so
he
said
after
a
moment
i
will
go
up
to
london
and
if
it
is
as
you
say
that
you
are
free
to
marry
whom
and
when
you
will
i
will
try
to
get
this
old
lawyer
consent
and
a
special
license
but
how
about
your
uncle
has
he
not
any
legal
right
over
you
miss
delburg
laughed
contentedly
not
in
the
least
only
that
i
have
to
live
with
him
until
i
am
married
parsons
that
the
lawyer
name
hates
him
and
he
hates
parsons
so
i
know
parsons
will
be
delighted
to
spite
him
by
giving
his
consent
if
you
just
say
uncle
mortimer
is
trying
to
force
me
into
a
marriage
against
my
will
with
his
nephew
samuel
greenbank
is
his
nephew
you
know
no
relation
to
me
it
is
aunt
jemima
who
is
sister
all
this
seemed
quite
convincing
michael
felt
relieved
i
see
he
said
well
it
appears
simple
enough
i
believe
i
could
be
back
by
thursday
and
i
could
have
my
chaplain
and
a
friend
of
mine
and
we
could
get
the
affair
over
in
the
chapel
and
then
you
can
go
back
to
the
inn
with
your
certificate
and
i
can
go
to
paris
free
and
his
thoughts
added
and
even
if
poor
maurice
does
die
soon
i
need
fear
nothing
now
that
their
two
fates
seemed
settled
miss
delburg
got
out
of
the
chair
and
stood
up
in
a
dignified
way
her
soft
cheeks
were
the
color
of
a
glowing
pink
rose
and
her
violet
eyes
shone
with
fun
and
excitement
her
little
irregular
features
and
perfect
teeth
seemed
to
add
to
the
infantine
aspect
of
the
picture
she
made
in
her
unfashionable
pink
cotton
frock
dress
had
been
strongly
discouraged
at
the
convent
and
was
looked
upon
by
aunt
jemima
a
strict
new
englander
as
a
snare
of
the
devil
but
even
the
garment
in
the
selecting
of
which
she
had
had
no
hand
seemed
to
hang
with
grace
upon
the
child
slim
figure
not
a
doubt
as
to
the
future
clouded
her
thoughts
it
was
all
a
glorious
piece
of
fun
and
of
all
the
daring
tricks
she
had
perpetrated
at
the
convent
to
get
chocolates
or
climb
a
tree
or
have
a
midnight
orgy
of
cake
and
sirop
none
had
been
so
exciting
as
this
to
go
through
the
ceremony
of
marriage
and
be
free
for
life
her
education
had
been
of
the
most
elementary
and
the
whole
aim
of
those
placed
over
her
had
been
to
keep
her
as
innocent
and
ignorant
as
a
child
of
ten
not
a
single
problem
of
life
had
ever
presented
itself
to
her
naturally
intelligent
mind
she
had
read
no
books
conversed
with
no
people
played
with
no
one
but
her
companions
three
american
girls
and
a
few
french
ones
and
the
simple
nuns
and
since
her
emancipation
she
had
but
wandered
in
the
english
lakes
with
her
uncle
and
aunt
and
samuel
greenbank
and
so
had
come
to
arranstoun
like
any
other
tourist
to
see
this
famous
castle
still
inhabited
after
eleven
hundred
years
in
these
days
of
women
giving
daily
proof
of
their
capability
for
irritating
mischief
if
not
of
their
ability
to
rule
nations
sabine
delburg
was
a
very
unique
being
and
could
not
have
existed
but
for
a
combination
of
rare
circumstances
as
she
was
half
american
and
half
french
and
had
inherited
the
quick
understanding
of
both
nations
but
from
the
age
of
seven
she
had
never
seen
the
outside
world
it
is
not
my
place
in
any
case
to
explain
what
she
was
or
was
not
the
creature
with
all
her
faults
and
charms
is
there
to
speak
for
herself
and
if
you
my
friend
who
are
reading
this
tale
on
a
summer
day
do
not
feel
you
want
to
hear
any
more
of
what
happened
to
these
two
young
things
by
all
means
put
down
the
book
and
go
your
way
so
let
us
get
back
to
arranstoun
and
the
june
afternoon
and
we
shall
hear
miss
delburg
saying
in
her
childish
voice
of
joy
nothing
could
be
better
i
always
did
like
doing
mad
things
it
will
be
the
greatest
fun
think
of
their
faces
when
i
prance
in
and
say
i
am
married
then
i
will
snap
my
fingers
at
them
and
go
off
and
see
the
world
michael
knelt
upon
a
low
old
which
was
near
and
looked
into
her
face
while
he
asked
whimsically
i
do
wonder
where
you
will
begin
miss
delburg
now
sat
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
this
was
a
grave
question
and
must
be
answered
at
leisure
though
without
indecision
oh
i
know
she
announced
there
was
my
great
friend
moravia
cloudwater
at
the
convent
she
was
older
than
me
and
went
to
paris
with
her
father
and
married
an
italian
prince
last
year
i
have
heard
from
her
since
and
she
has
often
wanted
me
to
go
and
stay
with
her
in
rome
and
i
shall
now
morri
and
i
are
the
dearest
friends
and
her
things
did
look
lovely
the
day
she
came
to
see
us
at
tours
with
the
prince
coronet
on
them
and
then
the
first
shadow
came
to
her
contentment
that
is
the
only
pity
about
you
even
with
a
castle
you
have
a
coronet
i
suppose
regretfully
i
should
have
liked
one
on
my
handkerchiefs
and
michael
felt
his
shortcomings
the
title
was
taken
away
when
we
followed
prince
charlie
and
we
only
got
back
the
land
by
the
skin
of
our
teeth
after
an
awful
business
so
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
do
that
for
you
but
perhaps
consolingly
you
will
have
better
luck
next
time
this
brought
some
comfort
why
of
course
we
can
get
a
divorce
as
soon
as
we
want
moravia
had
an
aunt
who
simply
went
to
sioux
falls
and
got
one
at
once
and
married
someone
else
so
it
not
the
least
trouble
oh
i
am
glad
you
have
thought
of
this
plan
it
is
clever
of
you
arranstoun
felt
that
he
was
becoming
rather
too
interested
in
his
and
time
was
passing
her
family
might
discover
where
she
was
or
henry
might
return
he
must
clinch
matters
finally
i
think
we
must
come
to
business
details
now
he
said
had
you
not
better
write
a
letter
to
parsons
that
i
could
take
stating
your
wishes
and
will
you
also
write
down
upon
another
piece
of
paper
all
the
details
of
your
name
age
and
so
forth
he
now
showed
her
his
and
gave
her
paper
and
pens
to
choose
from
she
sat
down
gravely
and
put
her
hands
to
her
head
as
one
thinking
hard
then
she
began
rapidly
to
write
while
arranstoun
watched
her
from
the
to
where
he
had
retired
she
evidently
wrote
out
the
statistics
required
first
and
then
began
her
letter
and
at
last
she
turned
a
rogue
face
with
a
perplexed
frown
on
it
while
she
bit
her
pen
how
do
you
spell
indigenous
please
he
started
forward
what
a
grand
word
one
has
to
be
grand
when
writing
business
letters
she
told
him
condescendingly
and
then
finished
her
missive
there
that
will
do
now
listen
she
got
up
and
stood
with
the
sheet
in
her
hand
and
read
off
the
remarkable
document
without
worrying
much
about
stops
or
commas
dear
parsons
papa
said
i
could
marry
who
i
wanted
to
provided
that
he
was
decent
so
please
give
your
written
consent
to
the
who
brings
this
his
name
is
arranstoun
and
he
is
indigenous
to
this
castle
and
really
an
aristocrat
who
papa
and
mamma
would
have
approved
of
although
he
unfortunately
has
no
title
i
had
to
put
in
that
you
see
and
she
looked
up
explainingly
because
it
sounds
so
ordinary
if
he
never
heard
of
arranstoun
we
would
have
only
uncle
mortimer
was
looking
out
for
old
ruins
to
visit
well
and
she
continued
her
recital
while
michael
lowered
his
head
to
hide
the
smile
in
his
eyes
we
wish
to
get
married
on
thursday
so
please
be
quick
about
the
consent
as
uncle
mortimer
wants
me
to
marry
his
nephew
samuel
greenbank
who
i
hate
agree
sir
the
expression
of
my
sentiments
the
most
distinguished
sabine
delburg
i
will
want
all
my
money
dollars
a
year
i
believe
it
is
on
friday
morning
then
she
looked
up
with
pride
do
you
think
that
will
do
michael
was
overcome
his
voice
shook
with
enchanted
mirth
admirably
he
assured
her
with
what
solemnity
he
could
sabine
seemed
thoroughly
satisfied
with
herself
that
all
right
then
now
i
must
be
off
or
they
will
be
coming
to
look
for
me
and
that
would
be
a
bore
but
we
have
not
made
all
the
arrangements
for
our
wedding
the
prospective
bridegroom
thought
it
prudent
to
remind
her
when
can
you
come
on
thursday
my
train
gets
in
about
six
thursday
and
she
contracted
her
dark
eyebrows
let
me
see
yes
we
are
staying
until
saturday
to
see
the
remains
of
elbank
monastery
but
i
do
know
how
i
can
slip
away
unless
only
it
would
be
so
late
i
could
say
i
had
a
headache
and
go
to
bed
early
without
dinner
and
get
here
about
eight
while
they
were
having
theirs
it
is
still
quite
light
i
often
had
to
pretend
things
at
the
convent
to
get
a
peace
michael
reflected
better
not
chance
eight
as
you
say
it
is
quite
light
then
and
they
might
see
you
slip
out
of
the
hotel
at
nine
the
park
gate
is
as
you
know
right
across
the
road
i
will
wait
for
you
inside
and
we
can
walk
here
in
a
few
minutes
and
come
up
these
balcony
steps
and
the
chapel
is
down
that
passage
through
this
door
see
he
went
and
opened
the
door
and
she
followed
him
talking
as
she
walked
nine
oh
that
is
late
i
have
never
been
out
so
late
before
but
it
ca
matter
just
this
once
can
it
and
here
in
the
north
it
is
so
funny
it
is
light
at
nine
too
perhaps
it
would
be
safest
then
peering
down
the
vaulted
passage
and
drawing
back
it
is
a
gloomy
hole
to
get
married
in
you
wo
say
so
when
you
see
the
chapel
itself
he
reassured
her
it
is
rather
a
beautiful
place
whenever
any
of
my
ancestors
committed
a
particularly
atrocious
raid
and
wanted
to
be
absolved
for
their
sins
they
put
in
a
window
or
a
painting
or
carving
the
family
was
catholic
until
my
grandfather
time
and
then
high
church
so
the
glories
have
remained
untouched
sabine
kept
close
to
him
as
they
walked
as
a
child
afraid
of
the
dark
would
have
done
it
seemed
to
her
too
like
her
recent
experience
of
the
secret
passage
and
then
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
frank
awe
and
admiration
when
he
opened
the
door
at
the
end
oh
how
divine
and
it
was
indeed
a
gem
of
the
finest
period
of
early
gothic
architecture
adorned
with
all
trophies
which
love
fear
and
contrition
could
compel
from
the
art
of
the
ages
glorious
colored
lights
swept
down
in
shafts
from
matchless
stained
glass
and
the
high
altar
was
a
blaze
of
richness
while
beautiful
paintings
and
tapestries
covered
the
walls
it
was
gorgeous
and
sumptuous
and
unlike
anything
else
in
england
or
scotland
it
might
have
been
the
private
chapel
of
a
proud
voluptuous
cardinal
in
rome
great
days
why
is
that
one
little
window
plain
sabine
asked
then
michael
answered
with
a
cynical
note
in
his
voice
it
is
left
for
me
i
who
am
the
last
of
them
to
put
up
some
expiatory
offering
i
expect
rapine
and
violence
are
in
the
blood
and
then
he
laughed
lightly
and
led
her
back
through
the
gloom
to
his
there
was
a
strange
fierce
light
in
his
bright
blue
eyes
which
the
did
not
see
and
which
if
she
had
perceived
she
would
not
have
understood
any
more
than
he
understood
it
himself
for
no
concrete
thought
had
yet
come
to
him
about
the
future
only
there
underneath
was
that
mighty
force
relentless
inexorable
of
heredity
causing
the
instinct
which
had
dominated
the
arranstouns
for
eleven
hundred
years
he
did
not
seek
to
detain
his
guest
and
promised
bride
but
with
great
courtesy
he
showed
her
the
way
down
the
stairs
of
the
lawn
and
so
through
the
postern
into
the
park
and
he
watched
her
slender
form
trip
off
towards
the
gate
which
was
opposite
the
inn
her
last
words
ringing
in
his
ears
in
answer
to
his
final
question
no
i
shall
not
fail
i
will
leave
the
crown
at
nine
exactly
on
thursday
then
turning
he
retraced
his
steps
to
his
and
there
found
henry
fordyce
returned
chapter
iii
well
old
boy
fordyce
greeted
him
with
you
should
have
been
with
me
and
had
a
good
round
of
golf
but
perhaps
though
you
have
made
up
your
mind
michael
flung
himself
into
his
great
chair
yes
i
have
and
i
have
got
a
fiancée
fordyce
was
not
disturbed
he
did
not
even
answer
this
absurd
remark
he
just
puffed
his
cigar
cigarettes
were
beneath
his
notice
you
do
seem
very
interested
his
host
ejaculated
rather
aggrievedly
tommyrot
i
tell
you
it
is
true
i
have
got
a
fiancée
my
dear
fellow
you
are
mad
no
i
assure
you
i
am
quite
sane
i
have
found
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
an
angel
has
dropped
from
the
clouds
to
save
me
from
violet
hatfield
henry
fordyce
was
actually
startled
michael
looked
as
though
he
were
talking
seriously
but
where
did
she
come
from
what
the
oh
i
have
no
patience
with
you
you
old
fool
you
are
playing
some
comedy
upon
me
henry
i
give
you
my
word
i
not
i
am
going
to
marry
a
most
presentable
young
person
at
nine
on
thursday
night
in
the
chapel
here
and
you
are
going
to
stay
and
be
best
man
then
his
excitement
began
to
rise
again
and
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
paced
up
and
down
restlessly
it
is
the
very
thing
she
wants
her
money
and
i
want
my
freedom
she
gets
hers
by
marriage
and
i
get
mine
i
do
care
a
rush
for
domestic
bliss
it
has
never
appealed
to
me
and
the
fellow
in
australia
who
come
after
me
has
got
a
boy
who
will
do
all
right
no
doubt
for
the
old
place
by
and
by
i
shall
have
a
perfectly
free
time
and
no
responsibilities
and
thank
the
lord
no
more
women
for
me
for
the
future
i
have
done
with
the
snakes
i
shall
be
happy
and
free
for
the
first
time
for
a
whole
year
fordyce
actually
let
his
cigar
go
out
this
incredible
story
was
beginning
to
have
an
effect
upon
him
but
where
did
she
come
from
he
asked
blandly
as
one
speaks
to
a
harmless
imbecile
i
leave
you
here
in
an
abject
state
of
despair
ready
almost
to
decide
upon
marrying
old
bessie
and
i
return
in
an
hour
and
you
inform
me
everything
is
settled
and
you
are
the
fiancé
of
another
lady
you
know
you
surprise
me
michael
my
word
you
do
michael
laughed
it
was
really
a
huge
joke
yes
it
is
quite
true
well
just
as
i
was
going
to
ring
and
send
james
for
bessie
to
talk
it
over
with
her
there
was
no
end
of
a
smash
as
you
see
and
a
girl
a
tourist
fell
through
the
secret
door
i
have
opened
it
for
five
years
she
was
running
away
from
a
horrid
fellow
she
was
engaged
to
it
seems
and
fled
into
the
passage
and
the
door
shut
after
her
and
she
could
not
get
out
so
she
pushed
on
in
here
it
adds
dramatic
color
to
the
story
the
girl
being
engaged
to
someone
else
pray
go
on
fordyce
had
now
picked
up
his
cigar
again
this
preposterous
tale
no
longer
interested
him
he
thought
it
even
rather
bad
taste
on
the
part
of
his
friend
all
right
michael
explained
you
need
not
believe
me
if
you
like
i
do
care
since
i
have
done
what
i
wanted
to
bar
chaff
henry
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
the
girl
appears
to
be
a
young
woman
of
decision
she
explained
at
once
her
circumstances
and
it
struck
us
both
that
to
go
through
the
ceremony
of
marriage
would
smooth
all
our
difficulties
we
can
easily
get
the
bond
annulled
later
on
henry
fordyce
put
down
his
cigar
again
i
am
off
to
town
you
wo
mind
will
you
michael
went
on
just
to
see
if
everything
is
all
right
and
to
get
her
consent
and
a
special
license
and
i
shall
be
back
by
the
six
train
on
thursday
in
time
to
get
the
ceremony
over
that
night
and
then
by
the
early
morning
express
if
you
wait
till
then
we
go
south
together
and
so
for
paris
and
freedom
henry
actually
rose
from
his
chair
and
the
bride
he
asked
michael
laughed
oh
she
may
go
to
the
moon
for
all
i
care
she
leaves
directly
after
the
ceremony
with
her
certificate
of
marriage
which
she
means
to
brandish
in
the
face
of
her
relations
who
are
staying
at
the
inn
and
so
exit
out
of
my
life
it
is
only
an
affair
of
expediency
it
is
the
affair
of
a
madman
michael
frowned
and
his
firm
chin
looked
aggressive
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
you
told
me
yourself
that
you
would
rather
marry
old
bessie
a
woman
of
than
violet
hatfield
and
now
when
i
have
found
a
much
more
suitable
person
a
pretty
little
lady
you
begin
to
talk
my
mind
is
made
up
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
fordyce
interrupted
bessie
would
have
been
much
more
suitable
a
plain
pretext
but
you
have
no
idea
what
complications
you
may
be
storing
up
for
yourself
by
marrying
a
young
girl
what
is
the
sense
in
it
he
continued
a
little
excited
now
the
younger
and
prettier
she
is
makes
her
all
the
more
unsuitable
to
be
used
merely
as
a
tool
in
your
game
confound
it
michael
and
her
game
too
his
host
reminded
him
his
eyes
were
flashing
now
and
that
expression
which
all
his
underlings
knew
meant
he
intended
to
have
his
own
will
at
any
cost
grew
upon
his
face
you
forget
that
in
scotland
divorce
is
not
an
impossibility
and
am
going
to
do
it
now
i
had
better
write
to
old
fergusson
my
chaplain
and
tell
him
to
be
in
readiness
and
i
suppose
i
ought
to
see
my
lawyers
in
edinburgh
although
as
there
are
no
settlements
and
it
is
just
between
ourselves
perhaps
it
does
not
matter
about
them
how
old
is
the
girl
fordyce
felt
it
prudent
to
ask
it
is
a
pretty
serious
thing
you
contemplate
you
know
oh
rot
she
is
seventeen
i
believe
and
for
that
sort
of
a
marriage
and
mere
business
arrangement
her
age
is
no
consequence
henry
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
for
a
moment
then
he
said
gravely
is
it
quite
fair
to
her
michael
had
gone
to
his
and
was
busily
scribbling
to
his
chaplain
but
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
startled
and
then
a
gleam
of
blue
fire
came
into
his
eyes
and
his
handsome
mouth
shut
like
a
vise
of
course
it
is
quite
fair
she
wishes
to
be
free
as
much
as
i
do
she
gets
what
she
wants
and
i
get
what
i
want
a
mere
ceremony
can
be
annulled
at
any
time
she
jumped
at
the
idea
i
tell
you
henry
i
have
not
got
time
to
go
into
the
pros
and
cons
of
that
side
of
the
question
and
i
do
want
to
hear
your
views
or
any
one
else
on
the
matter
i
mean
to
marry
the
girl
on
thursday
night
and
you
can
quite
well
put
off
going
south
until
friday
morning
and
see
me
through
it
fordyce
prepared
to
go
towards
the
door
and
when
there
said
in
a
voice
of
ice
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
i
can
not
prevent
your
doing
this
i
suppose
taking
advantage
of
a
young
girl
for
your
own
ends
it
seems
to
me
so
i
shall
go
now
michael
temper
began
to
blaze
with
this
his
oldest
friend
as
you
please
he
flashed
but
it
is
perfect
rot
all
this
high
palaver
the
girl
gains
by
it
as
well
as
i
am
not
taking
the
least
advantage
of
her
i
shall
have
to
get
her
guardian
consent
and
i
suppose
he
know
what
he
is
up
to
i
have
never
taken
any
advice
and
i
am
not
going
to
begin
now
old
boy
so
we
had
better
say
if
you
wo
stop
he
came
over
to
the
door
and
then
he
smiled
his
radiant
irresistible
smile
so
like
a
mischievous
jolly
boy
give
me
joy
henry
old
friend
he
said
and
held
out
his
hand
but
henry
fordyce
looked
grave
as
a
judge
as
he
took
it
i
ca
do
that
michael
i
am
very
angry
with
you
i
have
known
you
ever
since
you
were
born
and
we
have
been
real
pals
although
i
am
so
much
older
than
you
but
i
damned
if
i
stay
and
see
you
through
this
folly
and
without
a
word
further
he
went
out
of
the
room
closing
the
door
softly
behind
him
michael
gave
a
sort
of
whoop
to
binko
who
sprang
at
him
in
love
and
excitement
while
he
cried
very
well
get
along
old
saint
then
he
rang
the
bell
and
to
the
footman
when
he
came
he
handed
the
note
he
had
written
to
be
taken
to
fergusson
and
sent
orders
for
johnson
to
pack
for
two
nights
and
for
his
motor
to
be
ready
to
catch
the
express
at
the
junction
for
london
town
then
he
seized
his
cap
and
calling
binko
he
went
off
into
the
garden
and
so
on
to
the
park
and
to
the
golf
house
where
securing
his
professional
he
played
a
vigorous
round
and
when
he
got
back
to
the
castle
again
just
before
dinner
he
was
informed
that
fordyce
had
left
in
his
own
motor
for
edinburgh
chapter
iv
an
opalescence
of
soft
light
and
peace
and
beauty
was
over
the
park
of
arranstoun
on
this
june
night
of
its
master
wedding
and
he
walked
among
the
giant
trees
to
the
south
lodge
gate
only
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
postern
which
he
reached
from
his
all
had
gone
well
in
london
parsons
had
raised
no
objection
being
indeed
greatly
flattered
at
the
proposed
alliance
for
who
had
not
heard
of
the
famous
border
castle
of
arranstoun
and
envied
its
possessor
they
had
talked
a
long
time
and
settled
everything
tie
up
the
whole
of
miss
delburg
money
entirely
upon
herself
arranstoun
had
said
if
it
is
not
already
done
then
we
need
not
bother
about
settlements
i
understand
that
she
is
well
provided
for
and
how
about
your
future
children
parsons
asked
michael
stiffened
suddenly
as
he
looked
out
of
the
office
window
oh
er
they
will
naturally
have
all
i
possess
he
returned
quickly
and
now
as
he
neared
the
lodge
gate
and
nine
struck
a
suppressed
excitement
was
in
his
veins
for
no
matter
how
eventful
your
life
may
be
or
how
accustomed
you
are
to
chances
and
vivid
amusements
to
be
facing
a
marriage
ceremony
with
a
practically
unknown
young
woman
has
aspects
of
originality
in
it
calculated
to
set
the
pulses
in
motion
he
had
almost
forgotten
that
side
of
the
affair
which
meant
freedom
and
safety
for
him
from
the
claws
of
the
spider
although
he
had
learned
upon
his
return
home
from
london
that
she
had
as
henry
fordyce
had
predicted
that
she
might
popped
in
upon
him
having
motored
over
from
ebbsworth
and
had
left
him
a
letter
of
surprised
intense
displeasure
at
his
unannounced
absence
when
five
minutes
had
passed
and
there
was
as
yet
no
sign
of
his
promised
bride
crossing
the
road
from
the
inn
arranstoun
began
to
experience
an
unpleasant
impatience
the
quarter
chimed
his
temper
rose
had
she
been
playing
a
trick
upon
him
and
never
intended
at
any
time
to
come
he
grew
furious
and
paced
the
fine
turf
behind
the
lodge
swearing
hotly
as
was
his
wont
when
enraged
then
he
saw
a
little
figure
wrapped
in
a
gray
dust
cloak
much
too
big
for
it
advancing
cautiously
to
the
gate
in
the
twilight
and
he
bounded
forward
to
meet
her
and
to
open
the
narrow
before
the
old
bessie
could
have
time
to
see
who
was
there
at
last
he
cried
when
they
were
safely
inside
and
had
gone
a
few
paces
along
the
avenue
i
was
beginning
to
think
you
did
not
mean
to
keep
your
word
i
am
glad
you
have
come
why
of
course
i
meant
to
keep
my
word
i
never
break
it
sabine
said
astonished
i
am
longing
to
be
free
just
like
you
are
but
i
had
an
awful
business
to
get
away
i
have
never
been
so
excited
in
my
life
their
train
was
late
some
breakdown
on
the
branch
line
they
did
not
get
in
until
eight
and
i
dare
not
be
all
dressed
but
had
to
pretend
to
be
in
bed
covered
up
still
with
the
awful
headache
when
aunt
jemima
bounced
in
then
she
laughed
joyously
at
the
recollection
of
her
escape
the
moment
she
had
gone
off
to
her
supper
tucking
me
up
for
the
night
i
jumped
up
and
got
on
my
dress
and
hat
and
her
dust
cloak
and
then
i
had
to
watch
my
moment
creep
down
those
funny
little
stairs
and
out
of
the
side
door
and
so
across
here
you
know
it
was
far
harder
to
manage
than
the
last
feast
moravia
cloudwater
and
i
gave
to
the
girls
the
night
before
she
went
to
paris
is
it
fun
i
do
like
having
these
adventures
do
you
yes
said
michael
and
looked
down
into
her
face
she
was
extremely
pretty
he
thought
in
the
soft
dusk
of
this
northern
evening
her
leghorn
hat
with
its
wreath
of
blue
was
most
becoming
and
her
brown
hair
was
ruffled
a
little
by
the
hat
hasty
donning
illustration
he
bounded
forward
to
meet
her
i
need
keep
this
old
cloak
on
need
i
she
asked
nobody
can
see
us
here
and
it
is
so
hot
he
helped
her
off
with
it
and
carried
it
for
her
she
looked
prettier
still
now
the
slender
lines
of
her
childish
figure
were
so
exquisite
in
their
promise
of
beautiful
womanhood
later
on
and
the
sunday
frock
of
white
foulard
was
most
sweet
michael
was
very
silent
it
almost
made
her
nervous
but
she
prattled
on
this
is
my
best
frock
she
laughed
because
even
though
it
is
only
a
business
arrangement
one
could
get
married
in
an
old
blouse
could
one
of
course
not
and
he
strode
nearer
to
her
i
am
in
evening
dress
you
see
just
like
a
french
bridegroom
for
those
wedding
parties
in
the
bois
so
we
are
both
festive
but
here
we
are
at
the
postern
door
he
opened
it
with
his
key
and
they
stole
across
the
short
lawn
and
up
the
balcony
steps
like
two
stealthy
marauders
then
he
turned
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her
in
the
blaze
of
electric
light
welcome
oh
it
is
good
of
you
to
have
come
she
shook
hands
frankly
it
seemed
the
right
thing
to
do
she
felt
since
they
were
going
to
oblige
one
another
and
both
gain
their
desires
then
it
struck
her
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
a
very
handsome
young
man
quite
the
prince
charming
of
the
girls
dreams
a
thousand
times
finer
than
moravia
italian
prince
with
whom
for
her
part
she
had
been
horribly
disappointed
when
she
had
seen
his
photograph
only
it
was
too
silly
to
consider
this
one
in
that
light
since
he
was
really
going
to
be
hers
only
a
means
to
an
end
oh
the
pleasure
to
be
free
and
rich
and
to
do
exactly
what
she
pleased
she
had
been
planning
all
these
days
what
she
would
do
she
would
get
back
to
the
inn
not
later
than
ten
and
creep
quietly
up
to
her
room
through
that
side
door
which
was
always
open
into
the
yard
the
weather
was
so
beautiful
it
would
be
nothing
even
if
the
inn
people
did
see
her
entering
she
might
have
been
out
for
a
stroll
in
the
twilight
then
at
six
in
the
morning
she
would
creep
out
again
and
go
to
the
station
there
was
a
train
which
left
for
edinburgh
at
and
there
she
would
get
a
fast
express
to
london
later
on
after
a
good
breakfast
and
once
in
london
a
cab
would
take
her
to
parsons
and
after
that
money
and
freedom
she
had
planned
it
all
she
would
leave
a
letter
for
her
uncle
and
aunt
saying
she
was
married
and
had
gone
and
they
need
not
trouble
themselves
any
more
about
her
parsons
would
tell
her
where
to
stay
and
help
her
to
get
a
good
maid
like
moravia
had
and
then
she
would
go
to
paris
just
as
moravia
had
done
and
buy
all
sorts
of
lovely
clothes
it
would
take
her
perhaps
a
whole
month
and
then
when
she
was
a
very
grand
lady
she
would
write
to
her
dear
friend
and
say
now
she
was
ready
to
accept
her
invitation
to
go
and
stay
with
her
and
what
absolute
joy
to
give
moravia
such
a
surprise
to
say
she
was
married
and
free
and
had
quite
as
nice
things
as
even
that
princess
it
was
all
a
simply
glorious
picture
and
but
for
this
kind
young
man
it
could
never
have
been
hers
but
her
fate
would
have
been
samuel
greenbank
or
aunt
jemima
for
four
years
it
was
no
wonder
she
felt
grateful
to
him
and
that
her
handshake
was
full
of
cordiality
michael
pulled
himself
together
rather
sharply
the
blood
was
now
running
very
fast
in
his
veins
wait
here
he
said
to
her
while
i
go
into
the
chapel
to
see
if
fergusson
and
the
two
witnesses
are
ready
they
were
johnson
and
alexander
armstrong
and
the
old
chaplain
who
had
been
michael
father
tutor
and
was
now
an
almost
doddering
old
nonentity
also
stood
waiting
in
his
white
surplice
at
the
altar
rails
the
candles
were
all
lit
and
great
bunches
of
white
lilies
gave
forth
a
heavy
scent
a
strange
sense
of
intoxication
rose
to
michael
brain
when
he
returned
to
his
he
found
his
arranging
her
hat
at
the
old
mirror
which
had
reflected
her
before
wo
you
take
it
off
he
suggested
and
see
i
have
got
you
some
flowers
and
he
brought
her
a
great
bunch
of
stephanotis
which
lay
waiting
upon
a
table
near
there
is
no
because
that
is
for
real
weddings
but
wo
you
just
put
this
bit
of
stephanotis
in
your
hair
and
he
broke
off
a
few
blooms
she
was
delighted
she
loved
dressing
up
and
she
fixed
it
most
becomingly
with
dexterous
fingers
above
her
left
ear
you
do
look
sweet
he
told
her
now
we
must
come
and
he
gave
her
his
arm
she
took
it
with
that
grave
look
of
a
child
acting
in
a
very
serious
play
she
was
perfectly
delicious
with
her
blooming
youth
and
freshness
and
dimples
her
violet
eyes
shining
like
stars
and
her
red
full
lips
pouting
like
appetizing
ripe
cherries
michael
trembled
a
little
as
he
felt
her
small
hand
upon
his
arm
they
walked
to
the
altar
rails
and
the
ceremony
began
but
with
the
first
words
of
the
old
clergyman
voice
a
new
and
unknown
excitement
came
over
sabine
the
night
and
the
gorgeous
chapel
and
the
candles
and
the
flowers
all
affected
her
deeply
just
as
the
grand
feast
days
used
to
do
at
the
convent
a
sudden
realization
of
the
mystery
of
things
overcame
her
and
frightened
her
so
that
her
voice
was
hardly
audible
as
she
repeated
the
clergyman
words
what
were
these
vows
she
was
making
before
god
she
dared
not
think
the
whole
thing
was
a
maze
a
dream
it
was
too
late
to
run
away
but
it
was
terrible
she
wanted
to
scream
at
last
she
felt
her
bridegroom
place
the
ring
upon
her
finger
now
ice
cold
and
then
she
was
conscious
that
she
was
listening
to
these
words
those
whom
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
after
that
she
must
have
reeled
a
little
for
she
felt
a
strong
arm
encircle
her
waist
for
a
moment
then
she
knew
she
was
kneeling
and
that
words
of
no
meaning
whatever
were
being
buzzed
over
her
head
and
lastly
she
was
vividly
awakened
to
burning
consciousness
by
the
first
man
kiss
which
had
ever
touched
her
innocent
lips
so
she
was
married
and
this
was
her
husband
this
splendid
beautiful
young
man
there
beside
her
in
his
evening
clothes
and
it
was
over
and
she
was
going
away
and
would
never
see
him
again
and
what
had
she
done
and
would
god
be
very
angry
since
it
was
all
really
in
a
church
her
hand
trembled
as
she
wrote
her
name
sabine
delburg
for
the
last
time
and
she
was
shivering
all
over
as
she
walked
back
with
her
husband
to
his
through
the
gloomy
corridor
there
it
was
all
brilliant
light
again
the
light
of
soft
lamps
and
the
center
table
was
cleared
and
supper
for
two
and
opened
champagne
awaited
them
they
were
both
very
pale
and
sabine
sat
down
in
a
chair
fergusson
will
bring
a
copy
of
the
certificate
in
a
minute
michael
said
to
her
and
then
we
can
have
some
supper
but
now
come
we
must
drink
each
other
healths
he
poured
out
the
wine
into
two
glasses
and
handed
her
one
she
had
never
tasted
champagne
before
but
sipped
it
as
she
was
bid
it
did
not
seem
to
her
a
very
nice
drink
not
to
be
compared
to
aux
but
she
knew
at
weddings
people
always
had
champagne
michael
gulped
down
a
bumper
and
it
steadied
his
nerves
and
the
fresh
vigorously
healthy
color
came
back
to
his
face
the
whole
situation
had
excited
his
every
sense
let
me
wish
you
all
joy
arranstoun
he
said
the
little
bride
laughed
her
rippling
laugh
this
brought
her
back
to
earth
and
the
material
jolly
side
of
things
it
was
so
funny
to
hear
herself
thus
called
oh
that
does
sound
odd
she
cried
i
shall
never
call
myself
that
why
people
might
know
i
must
be
something
connected
with
this
castle
and
they
would
be
questioning
and
i
could
have
a
scrap
of
fun
you
have
got
another
name
you
said
it
just
now
howard
arranstoun
that
will
do
i
shall
be
howard
it
is
quite
ordinary
and
shall
i
be
a
widow
i
never
thought
of
all
this
yet
oh
it
will
be
fun
every
second
of
the
time
her
charm
was
further
affecting
michael
he
was
not
conscious
of
any
definite
intention
only
to
talk
to
her
to
detain
her
as
long
as
possible
she
was
like
a
breath
of
exquisite
spring
air
after
violet
hatfield
fergusson
here
came
in
from
the
chapel
with
the
certificate
and
his
presence
seemed
a
great
bore
and
after
thanking
him
for
his
services
michael
poured
him
out
some
wine
to
drink
their
healths
and
then
the
butler
announced
that
the
brougham
was
waiting
at
the
door
to
take
the
old
gentleman
home
sabine
had
stood
up
on
his
entrance
and
came
forward
to
wish
him
now
that
the
certificate
was
there
she
intended
to
go
herself
by
the
balcony
steps
as
soon
as
he
should
be
safely
off
by
the
door
my
dear
young
lady
i
have
known
your
husband
since
he
was
born
and
with
all
his
faults
he
is
a
splendid
fellow
let
me
wish
you
every
happiness
and
prosperity
together
and
may
you
be
blessed
with
many
children
and
peace
sabine
stiffened
she
felt
she
ought
to
enlighten
the
benevolent
old
man
who
evidently
did
not
understand
at
all
that
she
was
going
to
trip
off
not
as
he
just
to
her
own
home
but
out
of
arranstoun
life
forever
but
no
suitable
words
would
come
and
michael
afraid
of
what
she
might
say
hurried
his
chaplain
off
without
more
ado
and
then
returned
to
her
and
shut
the
door
now
they
were
absolutely
alone
and
the
clock
struck
ten
in
the
courtyard
with
measured
strokes
let
us
begin
supper
he
said
with
what
calmness
he
could
but
i
ought
to
go
back
at
once
his
bride
protested
the
inn
may
be
shut
and
then
what
in
the
world
should
i
do
there
is
plenty
of
time
it
certainly
wo
close
its
doors
until
eleven
have
some
soup
or
a
cold
quail
and
some
salad
and
see
i
have
not
forgotten
the
you
must
cut
that
sabine
was
very
hungry
she
had
had
to
pretend
her
head
was
aching
too
much
to
go
with
her
elders
to
the
ruins
of
elbank
and
had
retired
to
her
room
before
they
left
and
had
had
no
tea
and
such
dainties
were
not
to
be
resisted
especially
the
cake
after
all
it
could
not
be
any
harm
staying
just
this
little
while
longer
since
no
one
would
ever
know
and
people
who
got
married
always
did
cut
their
own
cakes
so
she
sat
down
and
began
he
taking
every
care
of
her
they
had
the
merriest
supper
and
even
the
champagne
more
of
which
he
gave
her
did
not
taste
so
nasty
after
the
first
sip
she
had
quail
and
salad
and
a
wonderful
ice
better
than
any
even
on
the
day
of
the
holiday
for
moravia
wedding
far
away
in
rome
and
there
were
marrons
glacés
too
and
other
divine
and
strawberries
and
cream
she
had
never
enjoyed
herself
so
much
in
her
whole
life
her
perfectly
innocent
prattle
enchanted
michael
more
and
more
with
its
touches
of
shrewd
common
sense
he
drank
a
good
deal
of
champagne
too
and
finally
when
it
came
to
cutting
the
cake
time
a
wild
thought
began
to
enter
his
head
the
icing
was
rather
hard
and
he
had
to
help
her
and
stood
beside
her
very
near
she
looked
up
smilingly
and
saw
something
in
his
face
it
caused
her
a
sudden
wild
emotion
of
she
knew
not
what
and
then
she
felt
very
nervous
and
full
of
fear
she
moved
abruptly
away
from
him
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
leaving
the
cake
and
stood
looking
at
him
with
great
troubled
violet
eyes
he
followed
her
you
little
sweet
darling
he
whispered
his
voice
very
deep
why
should
you
ever
go
away
from
me
i
want
to
teach
you
to
love
me
sabine
you
belong
to
me
you
know
you
are
mine
i
shall
not
let
you
leave
me
i
shall
keep
you
and
hold
you
close
and
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
for
he
was
a
man
you
see
and
the
moment
had
come
chapter
v
five
years
afterwards
elias
cloudwater
came
up
the
steps
of
the
savoy
hotel
at
carlsbad
and
called
to
the
arab
who
was
waiting
about
has
the
princess
come
in
from
her
drive
yet
he
was
informed
that
she
had
not
and
he
sat
down
in
the
verandah
to
wait
he
was
both
an
american
gentleman
and
an
american
father
therefore
he
was
accustomed
to
waiting
for
his
women
folk
and
did
not
fidget
he
read
the
york
and
when
he
had
devoured
the
share
list
he
glanced
at
the
society
news
and
read
that
among
others
who
were
expected
at
the
bohemian
health
resort
that
day
was
lord
fordyce
motoring
for
a
stay
of
three
weeks
for
the
cure
he
did
not
know
this
gentleman
personally
and
the
fact
would
not
have
arrested
his
attention
at
all
only
that
he
chanced
to
be
interested
in
english
politics
he
wondered
vaguely
if
he
would
be
an
agreeable
acquisition
to
the
place
and
then
turned
to
more
thrilling
things
presently
a
slender
young
woman
came
down
the
path
through
the
woods
and
leisurely
entered
the
gate
cloudwater
watched
her
and
a
kindly
smile
lit
his
face
he
thought
how
pretty
she
was
and
how
glad
he
was
that
she
had
joined
moravia
and
himself
again
this
summer
the
months
when
she
went
off
by
herself
to
her
house
in
brittany
always
seemed
very
long
he
saw
her
coming
from
far
enough
to
be
able
to
take
in
every
detail
about
her
extreme
slenderness
and
extreme
grace
were
her
distinctive
marks
the
face
was
childish
and
rounded
in
outline
but
when
you
looked
into
the
violet
eyes
there
was
some
shadow
of
a
story
hidden
there
she
was
about
years
old
and
was
certainly
not
at
carlsbad
for
any
reasons
of
cure
for
her
glowing
complexion
told
a
tale
of
radiant
health
her
white
clothes
were
absolutely
perfect
in
their
simplicity
and
so
was
her
air
of
unconcern
and
indifference
the
enigma
her
friends
often
called
her
she
seemed
so
frank
and
simple
and
no
one
ever
got
beyond
the
wall
of
what
she
was
really
thinking
what
did
she
do
with
her
life
it
seemed
ridiculous
that
any
one
so
rich
and
attractive
and
young
should
care
to
pass
long
periods
of
time
at
a
wild
spot
near
finisterre
in
an
old
château
perched
upon
the
rocks
completely
alone
but
for
an
elderly
female
companion
there
was
of
course
some
hidden
tragedy
about
her
husband
who
was
a
raging
lunatic
or
an
inebriate
shut
up
somewhere
perhaps
there
they
had
had
to
part
at
once
he
had
gone
mad
on
the
wedding
journey
some
believed
but
others
said
this
was
not
at
all
the
case
and
that
she
had
married
an
indian
chief
and
then
parted
from
him
immediately
in
america
finding
out
the
horror
of
being
wedded
to
a
savage
no
one
knew
anything
for
a
fact
only
that
when
she
did
come
into
the
civilized
world
it
was
always
with
the
princess
torniloni
and
her
father
who
if
they
knew
the
truth
of
howard
story
never
gave
it
away
men
swarmed
around
her
but
she
appeared
completely
unconcerned
and
friendly
with
them
all
and
not
even
the
most
envious
of
the
other
americans
who
were
trying
to
climb
into
princess
torniloni
exclusive
society
had
ever
been
able
to
make
up
any
scandals
about
her
i
have
had
such
an
enchanting
walk
clowdy
dear
the
slim
young
woman
said
as
she
sat
down
in
a
near
cloudwater
i
am
so
glad
we
came
here
are
you
and
i
am
sure
it
will
do
moravia
no
end
of
good
she
passed
me
as
i
was
coming
from
the
aberg
on
her
way
to
hans
heiling
so
she
will
not
be
in
yet
let
us
have
tea
the
arab
called
the
waiter
who
brought
it
to
them
one
or
two
other
little
groups
were
having
some
too
but
cloudwater
party
were
singularly
ungregarious
and
avoided
making
acquaintances
in
hotels
he
and
howard
chatted
alone
together
over
theirs
for
about
half
an
hour
presently
there
was
the
noise
of
a
motor
arriving
it
whirled
into
the
gate
and
stopped
where
they
usually
do
a
little
at
one
side
it
was
very
dusty
and
and
beside
the
chauffeur
there
got
out
a
tall
fair
englishman
the
personnel
of
the
hotel
came
forward
to
meet
him
with
empressement
and
as
he
passed
where
cloudwater
and
howard
were
sitting
they
heard
him
say
my
servant
brought
the
luggage
by
train
this
morning
so
i
suppose
the
rooms
are
ready
they
are
a
wonderful
race
cloudwater
remarked
are
they
sabine
i
never
can
understand
why
you
should
so
persistently
avoid
them
they
really
have
much
more
in
common
with
ourselves
than
latins
that
is
why
perhaps
one
likes
contrasts
and
french
and
russians
or
germans
are
far
more
intelligent
every
one
to
his
taste
and
howard
smiled
the
englishman
came
out
again
in
a
few
minutes
and
sitting
down
lazily
as
though
he
were
alone
upon
the
balcony
terrace
he
ordered
some
tea
not
the
remotest
scrap
of
interest
in
his
surroundings
or
companions
lit
up
his
face
he
might
have
been
forty
or
perhaps
but
being
so
fair
he
looked
a
good
deal
younger
and
had
a
peculiar
distinction
of
his
own
that
is
what
i
object
to
about
them
howard
remarked
presently
their
abominable
arrogance
look
at
that
man
it
is
just
as
though
there
was
no
one
else
on
this
balcony
but
himself
no
one
else
exists
for
him
why
sabine
you
are
severe
he
looks
to
me
to
be
a
pretty
considerably
nice
man
and
he
is
only
reading
the
paper
as
i
have
been
doing
myself
cloudwater
rejoined
perhaps
he
is
the
english
nobleman
who
i
read
was
expected
lord
fordyce
the
paper
said
and
was
that
the
name
of
rather
a
prominent
english
politician
who
had
to
go
into
the
upper
house
last
year
when
his
father
died
and
it
was
considered
he
would
be
a
loss
to
the
commons
i
really
do
know
i
do
take
the
slightest
interest
in
them
or
their
politics
ah
here
is
moravia
and
both
rose
to
meet
a
very
charming
lady
who
drove
up
in
a
victoria
and
got
out
she
had
all
the
perfection
of
detail
which
characterizes
the
very
american
woman
and
she
had
every
attraction
except
perhaps
a
voice
but
even
that
she
knew
how
to
modulate
and
disguise
so
that
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
princess
torniloni
passed
for
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
in
rome
or
paris
or
cairo
or
new
york
whenever
she
graced
any
of
the
cities
with
her
presence
she
was
a
widow
too
and
very
rich
the
prince
her
husband
had
been
dead
for
nearly
two
years
and
she
was
wearing
grays
and
whites
and
mauves
he
had
been
a
brute
too
but
unlike
her
friend
howard
husband
he
had
had
the
good
taste
to
be
killed
riding
in
a
steeplechase
and
so
all
went
well
and
the
pretty
princess
was
free
to
wander
the
world
over
with
her
indulgent
father
it
is
just
too
lovely
for
words
up
in
those
woods
papa
she
said
and
i
have
had
my
tea
in
a
dear
little
châlet
restaurant
you
did
not
wait
for
me
i
hope
they
assured
her
they
had
not
done
so
and
she
sat
down
in
a
comfortable
chair
her
arrival
caused
a
flutter
among
the
other
occupants
of
the
terrace
and
even
the
englishman
glanced
up
this
group
had
at
last
made
some
impression
it
would
seem
upon
the
retina
of
his
eye
for
he
looked
deliberately
at
them
and
realized
that
the
two
women
were
quite
worthy
of
his
scrutiny
but
i
hate
americans
he
said
to
himself
they
are
such
actresses
you
never
know
where
you
are
with
them
these
two
though
appear
some
of
the
best
presently
they
went
into
the
hotel
passing
him
very
closely
and
for
a
second
his
eyes
met
the
violet
ones
of
sabine
howard
and
he
was
conscious
that
he
felt
distinctly
interested
much
to
his
disgust
but
after
all
he
was
here
for
a
cure
and
a
rest
and
he
had
always
believed
in
women
as
recreations
his
solitary
table
was
near
theirs
in
the
restaurant
and
later
he
wrote
to
his
friend
michael
arranstoun
loitering
at
ostende
the
hotel
is
quite
decent
and
after
your
long
sojourn
in
the
wilds
you
will
have
an
overdose
of
polo
and
expensive
ladies
and
baccarat
you
had
much
better
join
me
here
at
the
end
of
the
week
there
are
two
pretty
women
who
would
be
quite
your
affair
they
have
the
next
table
and
neither
of
them
can
be
taking
the
cure
but
arranstoun
when
he
received
this
missive
had
other
things
to
do
he
had
been
out
of
england
and
indeed
europe
for
nearly
five
years
having
in
the
summer
of
joined
a
friend
to
explore
the
innermost
borders
of
china
and
tibet
and
there
the
passion
for
this
kind
of
thing
had
overtaken
him
and
his
own
home
knew
him
no
more
now
however
he
had
announced
that
he
had
returned
for
good
and
intended
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
at
arranstoun
as
a
model
landlord
he
started
this
by
playing
polo
at
ostende
where
he
had
run
across
henry
fordyce
they
had
cordially
grasped
each
other
hands
their
estrangement
forgotten
when
face
to
face
and
the
only
mention
there
had
been
of
the
circumstances
which
had
caused
their
parting
were
in
a
few
sentences
by
jove
henry
it
is
five
whole
years
since
you
thundered
morals
at
me
and
shook
the
dust
of
arranstoun
from
your
feet
you
did
behave
abominably
michael
but
i
am
awfully
glad
to
see
you
and
the
scene
at
ebbsworth
when
violet
hatfield
read
the
notice
in
the
scotsman
of
your
marriage
made
me
feel
you
had
been
almost
justified
in
taking
any
course
you
could
to
make
yourself
safe
but
how
about
your
wife
have
you
ever
seen
her
again
no
my
lawyer
tells
me
i
can
divorce
her
now
for
desertion
i
should
have
to
make
some
pretence
of
asking
her
to
return
to
me
he
says
which
of
course
she
would
refuse
to
do
and
then
both
can
be
free
but
for
my
part
i
am
not
hankering
after
freedom
much
i
do
very
well
as
i
am
and
i
always
cherish
a
rather
tender
recollection
of
her
illustration
his
solitary
table
was
near
theirs
in
the
restaurant
henry
laughed
i
have
often
pictured
that
wedding
he
said
and
the
little
bride
going
off
with
her
certificate
and
your
name
all
alone
no
family
turned
up
awkwardly
at
the
last
moment
to
mar
things
she
left
safely
after
the
ceremony
eh
michael
looked
away
suddenly
and
then
answered
with
overdone
unconcern
yes
soon
after
the
ceremony
i
do
wonder
you
had
no
curiosity
to
investigate
her
character
further
i
had
but
she
did
not
appreciate
my
interest
and
after
she
had
gone
i
was
rather
in
a
bad
temper
and
i
reasoned
myself
into
believing
she
was
probably
right
also
just
then
i
wanted
to
join
latimer
berkeley
expedition
to
china
i
remember
his
letter
about
it
came
by
the
next
morning
post
so
i
went
but
do
you
know
henry
i
believe
that
little
girl
made
some
lasting
impression
upon
me
i
believe
if
she
had
stayed
i
should
have
been
frantically
in
love
with
her
but
she
went
so
there
it
is
why
do
you
try
to
find
her
henry
asked
perhaps
i
mean
to
some
day
i
have
thought
of
doing
so
often
but
first
china
and
then
one
thing
and
another
have
stopped
me
besides
she
may
have
fancied
some
other
fellow
by
this
time
the
whole
thing
was
one
of
those
colossal
mistakes
if
we
could
only
have
met
ordinarily
and
not
married
in
a
hurry
and
then
parted
like
that
has
it
never
struck
you
she
was
rather
young
to
be
left
to
drift
by
herself
yes
often
then
michael
grew
a
little
constrained
i
believe
i
behaved
like
the
most
impossible
brute
henry
in
marrying
her
at
all
as
you
said
but
i
would
like
to
make
it
up
to
her
some
day
and
i
suppose
if
by
chance
she
has
taken
a
fancy
to
someone
else
by
this
time
and
wants
to
be
free
of
me
i
ought
to
divorce
her
but
by
heaven
i
believe
i
should
hate
that
you
dog
in
the
manger
yes
i
am
and
so
the
subject
had
ended
and
now
henry
third
lord
fordyce
was
taking
a
mild
cure
at
carlsbad
and
had
decided
that
in
his
leisure
moments
he
would
begin
to
write
a
book
a
project
which
had
long
simmered
in
his
brain
but
after
two
days
of
sitting
by
the
american
party
at
each
meal
a
very
strong
desire
to
converse
with
them
especially
the
one
with
the
strange
violet
eyes
overcame
him
and
with
deliberate
intention
he
scraped
acquaintance
with
cloudwater
in
the
exercise
room
of
the
kaiserbad
who
with
polite
ceremony
presented
him
that
evening
to
his
daughter
and
her
friend
sabine
had
been
particularly
silent
and
irritating
moravia
thought
and
as
they
went
up
to
bed
she
scolded
her
about
it
he
is
a
perfect
darling
sabine
she
declared
and
will
do
splendidly
to
take
walks
with
us
and
make
the
fourth
he
is
so
lazy
and
english
and
phlegmatic
i
like
to
make
him
crazy
with
love
but
he
looked
at
you
you
little
witch
not
at
me
at
all
you
are
welcome
to
him
morri
i
do
care
for
englishmen
pet
and
howard
kissed
her
friend
and
going
in
to
her
room
she
shut
the
door
chapter
vi
more
than
a
week
went
by
and
it
seemed
quite
natural
now
to
lord
fordyce
to
shape
his
days
according
to
the
plans
of
the
american
party
and
when
they
met
at
the
schlossbrunn
in
the
morning
at
seven
and
he
and
cloudwater
and
the
princess
had
drunk
their
tumblers
of
water
together
their
custom
was
to
go
on
down
to
the
town
and
there
find
sabine
who
had
bought
their
slices
of
ham
and
their
rolls
and
awaited
them
at
the
end
of
the
alte
weise
with
the
pink
paper
bags
and
then
the
four
proceeded
to
walk
to
the
kaiser
park
to
breakfast
this
meal
was
so
merry
howard
tantalizing
the
others
by
having
cream
in
her
coffee
and
sugar
upon
her
wild
strawberries
while
they
were
only
permitted
to
take
theirs
plain
during
the
stroll
there
it
was
sabine
custom
persistently
to
adhere
to
the
side
of
cloudwater
leaving
the
other
two
and
delightful
as
lord
fordyce
found
the
princess
this
irritated
him
he
discovered
himself
as
the
days
advanced
to
be
experiencing
a
distinct
longing
to
know
what
was
passing
in
that
little
head
whose
violet
eyes
looked
out
with
so
much
mystery
and
shadow
in
their
depths
he
could
not
tell
himself
that
she
avoided
him
she
was
always
friendly
and
casual
and
perfectly
at
her
ease
but
no
extra
look
of
pleasure
or
welcome
for
him
personally
ever
came
into
her
face
and
never
once
had
he
been
able
to
speak
to
her
really
alone
cloudwater
and
the
two
ladies
drove
back
from
breakfast
each
day
and
he
was
left
to
take
his
exercises
and
his
bath
now
and
then
he
had
encountered
the
princess
in
the
near
woods
just
before
luncheon
returning
from
the
kaiserbad
but
howard
never
and
when
he
inquired
how
she
spent
her
time
she
replied
however
she
happened
to
fancy
which
gave
him
no
clue
as
to
where
he
might
find
her
and
with
all
her
frank
charm
she
was
not
a
person
to
whom
it
was
easy
to
put
a
direct
question
lord
fordyce
began
to
grow
too
interested
for
his
peace
of
mind
when
he
realized
this
he
got
very
angry
with
himself
he
had
never
permitted
a
woman
to
be
anything
but
a
mild
recreation
in
his
life
and
at
forty
it
was
a
little
late
to
begin
to
experience
something
serious
about
one
they
often
motored
in
the
afternoon
to
various
resorts
not
too
far
distant
and
there
took
tea
and
for
two
whole
days
it
had
been
wet
and
except
at
meals
the
ladies
had
lain
however
fate
was
kind
on
a
saturday
morning
and
allowed
lord
fordyce
to
chance
upon
howard
right
up
at
the
belvedere
in
the
far
woods
looking
over
the
valley
she
was
quite
alone
and
her
slender
figure
was
outlined
against
the
bright
sunlight
as
she
leaned
on
the
balustrade
gazing
down
at
the
exquisite
scene
henry
could
have
cried
aloud
in
joy
at
last
but
he
restrained
himself
and
instead
only
said
a
casual
hullo
howard
turned
and
looked
at
him
and
answered
his
greeting
with
frank
cordiality
have
you
never
been
here
before
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
most
lovely
spots
in
the
whole
woods
and
at
this
time
there
is
never
any
one
what
made
you
penetrate
so
far
good
fortune
the
jade
has
been
unkind
until
now
they
leant
on
the
balustrade
together
i
always
like
being
up
on
a
high
mountain
and
looking
down
at
things
do
you
she
said
no
not
always
one
feels
lonely
but
it
is
nice
if
one
is
with
a
suitable
companion
how
have
you
at
your
age
managed
to
become
circumstance
i
expect
has
taught
me
the
beauty
of
solitude
i
spend
months
alone
in
brittany
and
what
do
you
do
read
most
of
the
time
he
was
so
enchanted
that
she
was
not
turning
the
conversation
into
banal
things
he
determined
not
to
say
anything
which
would
cause
her
again
to
draw
down
the
blind
of
bland
politeness
yes
i
read
a
great
deal
you
see
moravia
and
i
were
at
a
convent
together
and
there
beyond
teaching
us
to
spell
and
to
write
and
do
a
few
sums
and
learn
a
garbled
version
of
french
history
a
little
music
and
a
great
deal
of
embroidery
they
left
us
totally
ignorant
one
must
try
to
supply
the
deficiencies
oneself
it
is
appalling
to
remain
ignorant
once
one
realizes
that
one
is
knowledge
on
any
subject
is
interesting
did
you
begin
generally
or
did
you
specialize
i
always
wanted
to
be
just
and
to
understand
things
the
whole
of
life
and
existence
seemed
too
difficult
i
think
i
began
trying
to
find
some
key
to
that
and
this
opened
the
door
to
general
information
and
so
eventually
perhaps
one
specializes
he
was
wise
enough
not
to
press
the
question
into
what
her
specializing
ran
he
adored
subtleties
and
he
noted
with
delight
that
she
was
not
so
completely
indifferent
as
usual
if
he
could
keep
her
attention
for
a
little
while
they
might
have
a
really
interesting
investigation
of
each
other
thoughts
i
like
thinking
of
things
too
and
trying
to
discover
their
meanings
and
what
caused
them
we
are
all
of
course
the
victims
of
heredity
that
may
be
she
agreed
but
the
will
can
control
any
heredity
it
can
only
manifest
itself
when
we
let
ourselves
drift
the
tragedy
of
it
is
that
we
have
drifted
too
far
sometimes
before
we
learn
that
we
could
have
directed
the
course
if
we
had
willed
ignorance
is
seemingly
the
most
cruel
foe
we
have
to
encounter
because
we
are
so
defenseless
not
knowing
he
is
there
she
sighed
unconsciously
and
looked
out
over
the
beautiful
down
to
where
the
kaiser
park
appeared
like
a
little
doll
châlet
set
among
streams
and
pastures
green
lord
fordyce
was
much
moved
she
was
prettier
and
sweeter
than
he
had
even
fancied
she
would
be
could
he
ever
contrive
to
find
her
all
alone
he
watched
her
covertly
the
exquisite
peachy
skin
with
its
pure
color
and
her
soft
brown
hair
dressed
with
a
simplicity
which
he
thought
perfection
all
appealed
to
him
and
those
strange
violet
eyes
rather
round
and
heavily
lashed
with
lashes
darker
at
the
tips
the
type
was
not
intense
or
of
a
studious
mould
circumstance
must
indeed
have
formed
an
exotic
character
to
have
grafted
such
deep
meaning
in
their
innocent
depths
she
went
on
presently
not
remarking
his
silence
it
is
heredity
which
makes
my
country
women
so
nervous
and
unstable
as
a
rule
you
do
like
them
as
i
know
and
she
smiled
and
i
think
from
your
point
of
view
you
are
right
you
see
we
are
nearly
all
mushroom
growths
sprung
up
in
a
night
and
we
have
not
had
time
for
poise
or
the
acceptance
with
calmness
of
our
good
fortune
we
are
as
yet
unbalanced
by
it
and
do
know
what
we
want
you
are
very
charming
and
he
looked
truthful
and
at
that
moment
felt
so
yes
i
know
we
can
be
more
charming
than
any
other
women
because
we
have
learnt
from
all
the
other
nations
and
play
which
ever
part
we
wish
to
select
yes
he
admitted
rather
too
quickly
and
her
rippling
laugh
rang
out
he
had
hardly
ever
heard
her
laugh
and
it
enchanted
him
even
though
he
was
nettled
at
her
understanding
of
his
thought
it
remains
for
men
to
make
us
desire
to
play
the
same
part
always
if
they
find
it
agreeable
again
he
said
yes
but
this
time
slowly
now
you
englishmen
have
the
heredity
of
absolute
phlegm
to
fight
while
we
ought
to
be
trying
to
counteract
jumping
from
one
rôle
to
another
you
ought
to
try
to
teach
yourselves
that
versatility
is
a
good
thing
too
in
its
way
i
am
sure
it
is
i
wish
you
would
teach
me
to
understand
it
but
you
yourself
seem
to
be
restful
and
stable
how
have
you
achieved
this
by
studying
the
meaning
of
things
i
suppose
and
checking
myself
every
time
i
began
to
want
to
do
the
restless
things
i
saw
my
countrywomen
doing
we
have
wonderful
wills
you
know
and
if
we
want
a
thing
sufficiently
we
can
get
anything
that
is
why
moravia
says
we
make
such
successful
great
ladies
in
the
different
countries
we
marry
into
your
great
ladies
if
they
are
nice
are
great
naturally
and
if
they
are
not
they
often
fail
even
if
they
are
born
aristocrats
we
do
not
often
fail
because
we
know
very
well
we
are
taking
on
a
part
and
must
play
it
to
the
very
best
of
our
ability
all
the
time
and
gradually
we
play
it
better
than
if
it
were
natural
what
a
little
cynic
of
the
mouths
of
babes
and
he
laughed
i
am
not
at
all
a
cynic
it
is
the
truth
i
am
telling
you
i
admire
and
respect
our
methods
far
more
than
yours
which
just
like
topsy
but
cynicism
and
truth
are
unfortunately
synonymous
only
you
are
too
young
and
ought
not
to
know
anything
about
either
i
like
to
know
and
do
things
i
ought
not
to
her
eyes
were
merry
tell
me
some
more
about
your
countrywomen
i
awfully
interested
and
have
always
been
too
frightened
of
their
brilliancy
to
investigate
myself
we
are
not
nearly
so
bothered
with
hearts
as
europeans
heredity
again
our
mothers
and
fathers
generally
sprang
from
people
working
too
hard
to
have
great
emotions
then
we
arrive
and
have
every
luxury
poured
upon
us
from
birth
and
if
we
have
hardy
characters
we
weather
the
deluge
and
remain
very
decent
citizens
and
if
you
have
not
why
naturally
the
instincts
for
hard
work
which
made
our
parents
succeed
if
they
remain
idle
must
make
some
explosion
so
we
grow
restless
in
our
palaces
and
get
fads
and
nerves
and
quaint
diseases
and
have
to
come
to
carlsbad
and
talk
to
sober
englishmen
the
look
of
mischief
which
she
vouchsafed
him
was
perfectly
adorable
he
was
duly
affected
you
take
us
as
a
sort
of
cure
yes
how
do
you
know
so
much
about
us
and
our
faults
i
gathered
from
what
you
said
last
night
at
dinner
that
you
have
never
been
in
england
but
once
for
a
month
when
you
were
almost
a
child
the
rarest
specimens
come
abroad
and
a
dimple
showed
in
her
left
cheek
and
i
read
about
you
in
your
best
novels
even
your
authors
unconsciously
give
you
away
and
show
your
selfishness
and
arrogance
and
shocking
brutes
are
we
perfectly
then
they
both
laughed
and
sabine
suggested
it
was
time
they
returned
to
luncheon
it
is
quite
two
miles
from
here
and
cloudwater
although
the
kindest
dear
old
gentleman
begins
to
get
hungry
at
one
so
they
turned
and
sauntered
downwards
through
the
lovely
green
woods
with
the
warm
hum
of
insects
and
the
soft
summer
glancing
sunshine
and
all
of
you
who
know
the
beauties
of
carlsbad
or
indeed
any
other
of
those
bohemian
spas
can
just
picture
how
agreeable
was
their
walk
and
how
conducive
to
amiable
discussion
and
the
acceleration
of
friendship
henry
tried
to
get
her
to
tell
him
some
more
of
the
secrets
of
her
countrywomen
but
she
would
not
be
serious
she
was
in
a
merry
mood
and
turned
the
fire
into
the
enemy
camp
making
him
disclose
the
ways
of
englishmen
i
believe
you
like
us
as
a
rule
because
we
are
such
casual
creatures
he
said
at
last
rather
indifferent
about
and
apt
to
seize
what
we
desire
or
take
it
for
granted
a
sudden
shadow
came
into
her
face
which
puzzled
him
and
she
did
not
answer
but
went
on
to
talk
of
brittany
and
the
place
which
she
had
bought
héronac
just
a
weird
castle
perched
right
upon
a
rock
above
a
fishing
village
with
the
sea
dashing
at
its
base
and
the
spray
rising
right
to
her
windows
i
have
to
go
across
a
causeway
to
my
garden
upon
the
main
land
and
when
it
is
very
rough
i
get
soaking
wet
it
is
the
wildest
place
you
ever
saw
what
on
earth
made
you
select
it
lord
fordyce
asked
you
who
look
like
a
fresh
rose
to
choose
a
grim
brigand
stronghold
as
a
residence
it
suited
my
mood
on
the
day
i
first
saw
it
and
i
bought
it
the
following
week
i
make
up
my
mind
in
a
minute
as
to
what
i
want
you
must
let
me
motor
past
and
look
at
it
he
pleaded
and
when
my
days
of
drinking
this
uninteresting
water
is
up
i
intend
going
back
in
my
car
to
paris
and
from
there
down
to
see
mont
st
michel
you
shall
not
only
look
at
it
you
may
even
come
in
if
you
are
nice
and
do
not
bore
me
between
now
and
then
and
she
glanced
up
at
him
slyly
i
have
an
old
companion
madame
imogen
aubert
who
lives
with
me
there
and
she
always
hopes
i
shall
one
day
have
visitors
lord
fordyce
promised
he
would
be
a
pure
sage
and
if
she
would
put
him
on
probation
and
really
take
pains
to
sample
his
capabilities
of
not
boring
in
a
few
more
walks
he
would
come
up
for
judgment
at
héronac
when
it
was
her
good
pleasure
to
name
a
date
i
shall
be
there
toward
the
middle
of
august
after
we
leave
here
the
princess
and
dear
cloudie
go
to
italy
with
her
little
son
the
baby
torniloni
he
is
such
a
darling
nearly
three
years
old
he
is
at
héronac
now
with
his
nurses
and
you
go
back
to
brittany
alone
yes
then
i
shall
come
too
if
at
the
end
of
your
cure
you
have
not
bored
me
by
this
time
they
had
got
down
to
the
savoy
gate
and
there
found
moravia
and
cloudwater
waiting
for
them
on
the
balcony
clamoring
for
lunch
princess
torniloni
gave
a
swift
keen
glance
at
the
two
who
had
entered
but
she
did
not
express
the
thought
which
came
to
her
it
is
rather
hard
that
sabine
who
does
not
want
him
and
is
not
free
to
have
him
should
have
drawn
him
instead
of
me
that
night
in
the
restaurant
there
came
in
and
joined
their
party
one
of
those
american
men
who
are
always
to
be
met
with
in
paris
or
aix
or
carlsbad
or
monte
carlo
at
whatever
in
any
of
these
places
represents
the
ritz
hotel
one
who
knew
everybody
and
everything
a
person
of
no
particular
sex
but
who
always
would
make
a
party
go
with
his
stories
and
his
gaiety
and
help
along
any
hostess
cranley
beaton
was
this
one
name
the
cloudwater
party
were
all
quite
glad
to
welcome
him
and
hear
news
of
their
friends
one
or
two
decent
people
had
arrived
that
afternoon
also
and
moravia
felt
she
could
be
quite
amused
and
wear
her
pretty
clothes
sabine
hated
the
avalanches
of
dinners
and
lunches
and
what
not
this
would
mean
her
sense
of
humor
was
very
highly
developed
and
she
often
laughed
in
a
fond
way
over
her
friend
who
was
in
her
search
for
pleasure
still
as
keen
as
she
had
been
in
convent
days
you
do
remain
so
young
morri
she
told
her
as
they
linked
arms
going
up
to
bed
their
rooms
were
on
the
first
floor
and
they
disdained
the
lift
do
you
remember
you
used
to
be
the
mother
to
all
of
us
at
anne
and
now
i
am
the
mother
of
us
two
you
are
an
old
sibyl
that
is
what
you
are
darling
the
princess
returned
i
wish
i
could
ever
know
what
has
so
utterly
changed
you
from
our
convent
days
and
she
sighed
impatiently
then
you
were
the
merriest
madcap
ready
to
tease
any
one
and
to
have
any
lark
and
for
nearly
these
four
years
since
we
have
been
together
again
you
have
been
another
person
grave
and
what
are
you
always
thinking
of
sabine
they
had
reached
their
and
howard
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
wide
i
grew
up
in
one
year
moravia
i
grew
a
hundred
years
old
and
all
the
studies
which
i
indulge
in
at
héronac
teach
me
that
peace
and
poise
are
the
things
to
aim
at
i
can
not
tell
you
any
more
i
did
not
mean
to
probe
into
your
secrets
darling
the
princess
exclaimed
hastily
i
promised
you
i
never
would
when
you
came
to
me
that
november
in
rome
we
were
both
miserable
enough
goodness
knows
we
made
the
bargain
that
there
should
be
no
retrospects
and
your
angelic
goodness
to
me
all
that
time
when
my
little
girolamo
was
born
have
made
me
your
eternal
debtor
why
but
for
you
darling
he
might
have
been
snatched
from
me
by
the
hateful
torniloni
family
the
sweet
cherub
then
their
conversation
turned
to
this
absorbing
topic
the
perfections
of
girolamo
and
as
it
is
hardly
one
which
could
interest
you
or
me
my
friend
let
us
go
back
to
the
and
listen
to
a
conversation
going
on
between
cranley
beaton
and
lord
fordyce
the
latter
with
great
skill
had
begun
to
elicit
certain
information
he
desired
from
this
society
register
yes
indeed
beaton
was
saying
she
is
a
peach
the
husband
and
he
looked
extremely
wise
oh
she
made
some
frightful
mésalliance
out
west
and
they
say
he
shut
in
a
madhouse
or
home
for
inebriates
her
entrance
among
us
dates
from
when
she
first
appeared
in
paris
about
three
years
ago
with
princess
torniloni
she
is
awfully
rich
and
awfully
good
and
it
is
a
real
pity
she
does
not
divorce
the
ruffian
and
begin
again
she
is
not
free
then
and
lord
fordyce
felt
his
heart
sink
i
thought
probably
she
had
got
rid
of
any
encumbrance
as
it
is
fairly
easy
over
with
you
why
she
could
in
a
moment
if
she
wanted
to
i
expect
beaton
assured
his
listener
she
has
fancied
anyone
else
yet
when
she
does
she
will
no
doubt
her
husband
is
an
american
then
why
of
course
did
i
tell
you
she
came
from
the
west
why
i
remember
crossing
with
her
she
was
in
deep
mourning
in
the
summer
of
she
never
spoke
to
anyone
on
board
and
it
was
about
eighteen
months
after
that
i
was
presented
to
her
in
paris
she
gets
prettier
every
day
lord
fordyce
felt
this
was
true
so
she
could
be
free
if
she
fancied
anyone
you
think
he
hazarded
casually
as
though
his
interest
in
the
subject
had
waned
and
when
beaton
had
answered
yes
rather
lord
fordyce
got
up
and
sauntered
off
toward
bed
one
has
to
be
up
so
early
in
the
morning
here
he
remarked
agreeably
see
you
at
the
schlossbrunn
chapter
vii
after
this
for
several
days
howard
made
it
rather
difficult
for
lord
fordyce
to
speak
to
her
alone
although
he
saw
her
every
day
and
at
every
meal
and
each
hour
grew
more
enamored
she
for
her
part
was
certainly
growing
to
like
him
he
soothed
her
his
intelligence
was
highly
trained
and
he
was
courteous
and
gentle
and
sympathetic
but
for
some
reason
which
she
could
not
explain
she
had
no
wish
to
precipitate
matters
her
mind
was
quite
without
any
definite
desire
or
determination
but
being
a
woman
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
henry
was
falling
in
love
with
her
a
number
of
other
men
had
done
so
before
and
had
then
at
once
begun
to
be
uninteresting
in
her
eyes
it
was
as
if
she
were
numb
to
the
attraction
of
men
but
this
one
had
qualities
which
appealed
to
her
her
own
countrymen
were
never
cultivated
enough
in
literature
and
were
too
absorbed
in
stocks
and
shares
to
be
able
to
take
flights
of
sentiment
and
imagination
with
her
lord
fordyce
understood
in
a
second
and
they
could
discuss
any
subject
with
a
refined
subtlety
which
enchanted
her
henry
had
not
spent
his
life
maneuvring
love
affairs
with
women
and
was
not
very
clever
at
manipulating
circumstance
he
fretted
and
fumed
at
not
getting
his
desired
but
with
all
the
will
was
too
hedged
in
by
conventionality
and
a
sense
of
politeness
to
force
matters
as
his
friend
michael
arranstoun
would
have
done
with
unconcern
thus
his
cure
at
carlsbad
was
drawing
to
a
close
before
he
again
spent
an
afternoon
quite
alone
with
sabine
howard
they
had
gone
to
the
aberg
to
tea
and
the
princess
had
expressed
herself
too
tired
to
walk
back
and
had
got
into
the
waiting
carriage
making
cranley
beaton
accompany
her
she
was
not
in
a
perfectly
amiable
temper
lord
fordyce
attracted
her
strongly
and
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
he
had
only
eyes
for
sabine
who
cared
for
him
not
at
all
the
princess
found
cranley
beaton
absolutely
tiresome
no
better
than
the
york
she
thought
pettishly
or
the
daily
to
be
with
the
waters
were
getting
on
her
nerves
too
she
would
be
glad
to
leave
and
go
to
sorrento
with
that
cupid
among
infants
girolamo
sabine
had
better
divorce
her
horror
of
a
husband
and
marry
the
man
and
have
done
with
it
now
the
walk
from
the
aberg
down
through
the
woods
is
a
peculiarly
delightful
one
and
even
in
the
season
at
carlsbad
not
by
people
henry
fordyce
felt
duly
elated
at
the
prospect
and
howard
had
an
air
of
pensive
mischief
in
her
violet
eyes
lord
fordyce
who
had
been
accustomed
for
years
to
making
speeches
for
his
party
and
was
known
as
a
ready
orator
found
himself
rather
silent
and
even
a
little
nervous
for
the
first
hundred
yards
or
so
she
looked
so
bewitching
he
thought
in
her
fresh
white
linen
showing
up
the
round
peachiness
of
her
young
cheeks
and
those
curling
childish
brown
lashes
making
their
shadow
he
was
overcome
with
a
desire
to
kiss
her
she
was
so
supremely
healthy
and
delectable
he
felt
he
had
been
altogether
a
fool
in
his
estimate
of
the
serious
necessities
of
life
hitherto
woman
was
now
one
of
them
and
this
woman
supremely
so
why
if
she
could
be
freed
from
bonds
should
she
not
become
his
wife
but
he
felt
it
might
be
wiser
not
to
be
too
precipitate
about
suggesting
the
thing
to
her
she
had
certainly
given
him
no
indication
that
she
would
receive
the
idea
favorably
and
appeared
to
be
of
the
type
of
character
which
could
not
be
coerced
he
felt
very
glad
michael
arranstoun
had
not
responded
to
his
pressing
request
to
join
him
it
would
be
far
better
that
that
irritatingly
attractive
specimen
of
manhood
should
not
step
upon
the
scene
until
he
himself
had
some
definite
hope
of
affairs
being
satisfactorily
settled
they
began
their
talk
upon
the
lightest
subjects
and
gradually
drifted
into
one
of
the
discussions
of
emotions
in
the
abstract
which
are
so
fascinating
and
so
dangerous
and
which
require
skill
to
direct
and
continue
howard
held
that
pleasure
could
alone
come
from
harmony
of
body
and
spirit
while
lord
fordyce
maintained
that
wild
discords
could
also
produce
it
and
that
it
could
not
be
defined
as
governed
by
any
law
one
is
sometimes
full
of
pleasure
even
against
one
will
he
said
every
spiritual
principle
and
conviction
may
be
outraged
and
yet
for
some
unaccountable
reason
pleasure
remains
howard
opened
her
eyes
wide
as
if
at
a
sudden
thought
yes
she
said
i
wish
it
were
not
true
what
you
say
but
it
is
and
it
is
a
great
injustice
what
makes
you
say
that
henry
asked
quickly
you
were
thinking
of
some
particular
thing
do
tell
me
i
was
thinking
how
some
people
can
sin
and
err
in
every
way
and
yet
there
is
something
about
them
which
causes
them
to
be
forgiven
and
which
even
causes
pleasure
while
they
are
sinning
and
there
are
others
who
might
do
the
same
things
and
would
be
anathematised
at
once
and
no
joy
felt
with
them
at
any
time
moravia
and
i
call
it
having
some
people
have
it
and
some
people
have
not
got
it
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
it
is
a
strange
thing
but
i
know
what
you
mean
i
know
one
particular
case
of
it
in
a
friend
of
mine
no
matter
what
he
does
one
always
forgives
him
it
does
not
depend
upon
looks
either
although
this
actual
person
is
abominably
it
does
not
depend
upon
intelligence
or
character
or
anything
as
you
say
it
is
just
now
you
have
it
and
the
princess
perfectly
charming
though
she
is
has
not
sabine
did
not
contradict
him
she
never
was
conventional
denying
truths
for
the
sake
of
diffidence
or
politeness
moravia
was
beautiful
and
charming
but
it
was
true
she
had
not
i
think
it
applies
more
to
men
than
to
women
was
all
she
said
you
were
thinking
of
a
man
then
when
you
spoke
yes
i
was
thinking
of
a
man
but
it
is
not
an
interesting
subject
lord
fordyce
decided
that
it
was
but
he
did
not
continue
it
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
héronac
he
requested
and
what
charmed
you
in
it
enough
to
make
you
buy
it
suddenly
like
that
how
did
you
come
upon
it
i
had
just
arrived
from
america
at
the
end
of
july
of
four
years
ago
and
i
found
when
i
got
to
cherbourg
that
i
could
not
join
my
friend
the
princess
as
i
had
intended
because
her
husband
had
taken
her
off
to
his
country
place
near
naples
so
i
hired
a
motor
and
wandered
down
into
brittany
alone
i
wanted
to
be
alone
i
was
motoring
along
when
a
violent
storm
came
on
furious
rain
and
wind
and
just
at
the
worst
and
weirdest
moment
i
passed
héronac
which
is
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
edge
of
the
present
village
it
stands
out
in
the
sea
on
a
great
spur
of
rock
entirely
separated
from
the
main
land
by
a
deep
chasm
about
thirty
feet
wide
over
which
there
was
then
a
broken
bridge
which
had
once
been
a
drawbridge
it
was
a
huge
grim
ruin
with
only
a
few
roofed
rooms
built
in
about
the
thirteenth
century
originally
and
of
course
added
to
and
modernized
the
house
actually
standing
within
the
great
towers
is
of
the
date
of
louis
xiv
it
stood
there
a
dark
mass
defying
the
storm
although
the
huge
waves
splashed
right
up
to
the
windows
it
sounds
repellent
it
was
fierce
and
grim
and
repellent
and
it
suited
my
mood
so
i
stopped
at
the
inn
my
old
maid
simone
and
i
and
i
got
permission
to
go
and
see
it
the
landlord
of
the
inn
had
the
keys
the
last
of
the
héronacs
drank
himself
to
death
with
absinthe
in
paris
so
the
place
was
closed
and
was
no
doubt
for
sale
oui
he
told
us
simone
was
terrified
to
cross
the
wretched
bridge
with
the
water
swirling
beneath
and
we
left
her
to
go
back
to
the
inn
while
the
landlord
son
came
with
me
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
and
was
a
most
extraordinary
day
for
now
it
began
to
thunder
and
lighten
i
wonder
you
were
not
afraid
i
am
never
afraid
i
tell
you
it
suited
me
there
was
still
some
furniture
in
the
roofed
part
of
the
inner
court
and
in
the
two
great
towers
which
flank
the
main
building
but
in
that
the
roof
was
off
but
the
view
from
the
windows
when
we
crept
along
to
them
across
the
broken
floor
was
too
superb
straight
out
to
the
ocean
the
waves
thundering
at
the
base
i
made
up
my
mind
that
night
i
would
buy
it
if
i
could
and
as
i
told
you
before
i
did
so
in
the
following
week
how
quaint
of
you
it
has
been
the
greatest
delight
to
me
and
as
you
will
see
i
have
done
something
with
it
i
restored
the
center
and
have
made
its
arrangements
modern
and
comfortable
but
have
left
that
one
huge
room
on
the
first
floor
as
it
was
only
with
the
roof
mended
i
spend
hours
and
hours
in
the
deep
window
embrasures
looking
right
over
the
sea
it
has
taught
me
more
of
the
meaning
of
things
than
all
my
books
you
speak
as
though
you
were
an
old
woman
lord
fordyce
exclaimed
and
you
look
only
a
mere
child
now
then
when
you
bought
this
brigand
stronghold
you
must
have
been
in
the
nursery
i
was
over
eighteen
a
colossal
age
it
was
simply
ridiculous
for
you
to
be
wanting
dark
castles
and
solitude
what
and
then
he
paused
he
did
not
continue
his
question
i
was
really
very
old
i
had
been
old
for
almost
a
year
and
do
you
mean
to
remain
old
always
or
will
you
ever
let
anyone
teach
you
to
be
young
sabine
looked
away
into
the
somber
fir
trees
they
had
got
to
a
part
of
the
path
where
the
woods
on
either
side
are
black
as
night
in
their
depths
i
do
know
she
said
very
low
lord
fordyce
moved
nearer
to
her
i
wish
you
would
let
me
try
to
take
away
all
those
somber
thoughts
i
see
sometimes
in
those
sweet
eyes
how
would
you
begin
by
loving
you
very
much
and
then
by
trying
to
make
you
love
me
does
love
take
away
dark
thoughts
then
or
does
it
bring
them
that
depends
upon
the
love
he
told
her
eagerly
when
it
is
great
enough
to
be
unselfish
it
must
bring
peace
and
happiness
surely
they
are
good
things
they
are
harmony
but
yes
what
are
the
buts
his
voice
trembled
a
little
love
seems
to
me
to
be
a
wild
thing
a
raging
tearing
passion
can
it
ever
be
just
tender
and
kind
i
wish
you
would
let
me
prove
to
you
that
it
can
she
looked
into
his
face
gravely
and
there
was
nothing
but
honest
question
in
her
violet
eyes
to
what
end
she
asked
i
would
like
you
to
marry
me
he
had
said
it
now
when
he
had
not
intended
to
yet
and
he
was
pale
as
death
she
shrank
from
him
a
little
but
surely
you
know
that
i
am
not
free
i
hoped
i
believed
that
you
can
make
yourself
so
if
you
knew
how
i
love
you
i
have
never
really
loved
any
woman
before
in
my
life
i
always
thought
they
should
be
only
recreations
but
the
moment
i
saw
you
my
whole
opinions
changed
she
grew
troubled
i
wish
you
had
not
said
this
to
me
she
faltered
i
do
not
know
that
i
wish
to
change
my
life
i
could
of
course
be
free
i
suppose
if
i
wanted
to
be
but
i
am
not
sure
what
would
it
mean
if
i
listened
to
you
tell
me
i
am
sometimes
very
lonely
and
i
like
you
so
much
i
want
to
make
you
feel
more
than
that
but
i
will
be
content
with
whatever
you
will
give
me
i
do
not
care
one
atom
what
dark
page
is
in
your
past
i
know
it
can
have
been
nothing
of
your
own
fault
and
if
it
were
i
should
not
care
i
only
care
for
you
sabine
will
you
not
tell
me
that
you
will
try
to
let
me
make
you
happy
it
would
mean
that
that
i
should
devote
my
whole
life
to
making
you
happy
a
woman
should
be
contented
with
that
surely
she
said
and
if
henry
fordyce
had
had
his
usual
critical
wits
about
him
unclouded
by
love
he
would
have
smiled
his
cynical
smile
and
have
said
to
himself
the
spark
is
not
lit
my
friend
her
voice
lacks
enthusiasm
and
her
brows
are
calm
but
he
was
like
all
lovers
blind
and
only
saw
and
heard
what
could
comfort
his
heart
and
so
caught
at
the
straw
with
delight
whatever
you
asked
i
would
give
you
only
say
that
you
will
let
me
set
about
helping
you
to
be
free
at
once
howard
however
had
not
gone
this
far
in
her
imaginings
the
idea
had
started
in
her
brain
no
doubt
but
it
had
not
matured
yet
and
all
was
hesitancy
i
can
not
promise
anything
you
must
give
me
time
to
think
lord
fordyce
dearest
of
course
i
will
but
you
will
take
steps
to
make
yourself
free
will
you
not
i
have
not
asked
and
i
will
not
ask
you
a
single
question
only
that
you
will
tell
me
when
i
really
may
hope
his
voice
was
deep
with
feeling
and
his
distinguished
clever
face
was
eager
and
full
of
devotion
as
they
turned
an
abrupt
corner
and
there
came
face
to
face
with
two
of
their
american
acquaintances
in
the
hotel
is
this
a
charming
walk
howard
and
yes
is
it
and
bows
and
passings
on
but
it
broke
the
current
destroyed
the
spell
and
released
some
spirit
of
mischief
in
sabine
heart
for
she
would
not
be
grave
for
another
second
she
made
henry
promise
he
would
just
amuse
her
and
not
refer
again
to
those
serious
topics
unless
she
gave
him
leave
and
he
accustomed
to
go
his
own
way
unhampered
by
the
caprices
of
the
gentle
sex
agreed
so
under
the
dominion
of
love
had
he
become
for
a
woman
too
who
in
herself
combined
three
things
he
had
always
disliked
she
was
an
american
she
was
very
young
and
she
had
an
equivocal
position
but
the
little
god
does
not
consult
the
individual
before
he
shoots
his
darts
and
punishes
the
most
severely
those
who
have
denied
his
power
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
savoy
sabine
with
that
aptitude
though
it
was
perfectly
unconscious
in
her
which
is
the
characteristic
of
all
her
countrywomen
had
reduced
lord
fordyce
to
complete
subjection
so
that
he
was
ready
to
do
any
mortal
thing
in
the
world
for
her
and
willing
to
grasp
suggestions
of
hope
upon
any
terms
she
gave
him
a
friendly
smile
and
disappeared
up
the
stairs
to
their
there
to
find
moravia
indulging
in
nerves
i
just
want
to
scream
darling
that
lady
said
and
sabine
patted
her
hands
then
do
morri
dearest
she
implored
her
you
only
want
to
because
your
mother
if
she
had
been
idle
would
have
wanted
to
scrub
the
floors
just
as
my
father
business
capacity
came
out
in
me
just
now
and
i
fenced
with
and
sampled
a
very
noble
gentleman
instead
of
being
simple
with
him
let
us
get
above
our
instincts
and
be
the
real
aristocrats
we
appear
to
the
world
but
the
princess
had
to
have
some
sal
volatile
that
night
after
dinner
waywardness
was
upon
sabine
she
would
read
the
york
which
she
had
absolutely
not
glanced
at
since
their
arrival
at
carlsbad
so
absorbed
and
entranced
had
she
been
in
her
walks
in
the
green
woods
and
so
little
interested
was
she
ever
in
the
doings
of
the
world
she
glanced
at
the
trouville
news
and
the
homburg
news
with
wandering
mind
and
then
her
eye
fell
upon
the
polo
at
ostende
and
there
she
read
that
the
english
team
had
been
giving
a
delightful
dance
at
the
casino
where
michael
arranstoun
had
sumptuously
entertained
a
party
of
his
friends
amongst
them
miss
daisy
van
der
horn
the
paragraph
was
worded
with
that
masterly
simplicity
which
distinguishes
intelligent
modern
journalism
and
left
the
reader
mind
confused
as
to
words
but
clear
as
to
suggestion
sabine
howard
knew
miss
daisy
van
der
horn
as
she
read
the
bright
soft
color
left
her
cheeks
and
then
returned
with
a
brilliant
flush
it
was
the
first
time
for
five
years
she
had
ever
read
the
name
of
arranstoun
in
any
paper
she
held
the
sheet
firmly
and
perused
all
the
other
information
of
the
day
but
when
she
put
it
down
and
joined
in
the
general
conversation
it
could
have
been
remarked
that
her
eyes
were
glittering
like
fixed
stars
and
when
for
a
moment
they
all
went
out
on
the
balcony
to
breathe
in
the
warm
soft
night
she
whispered
to
henry
fordyce
i
have
been
thinking
i
will
at
all
events
begin
to
take
steps
to
be
free
but
to
his
rapturous
my
darling
she
replied
with
lowered
lids
it
will
take
some
time
and
you
may
not
like
waiting
and
when
i
am
free
i
do
not
know
only
i
am
tired
and
i
want
someone
to
help
me
to
forget
and
begin
again
then
after
she
got
to
her
room
she
opened
the
window
wide
and
looked
out
upon
the
quiet
firs
but
nothing
stilled
the
unrest
in
her
heart
chapter
viii
héronac
was
basking
in
the
sun
of
an
august
morning
like
some
huge
sea
monster
which
had
clambered
upon
the
wet
rocks
the
sea
was
intensely
blue
without
a
ripple
upon
it
and
only
the
smallest
white
line
marked
where
its
waters
caressed
the
shore
nature
slumbered
in
the
heat
and
was
silent
and
sabine
howard
the
châtelaine
of
this
quaint
château
stood
looking
out
of
the
deep
windows
in
her
great
it
was
a
wonderful
room
she
had
collected
dark
panelling
and
tapestry
to
hide
the
grim
stone
walls
and
had
managed
to
buy
a
splendidly
carved
and
painted
roof
while
her
sense
of
color
had
run
riot
in
beautiful
silks
for
curtains
it
was
a
remarkable
achievement
for
one
so
young
and
who
had
begun
so
ignorantly
her
mother
family
had
been
decently
enough
bred
and
her
maternal
grandfather
had
been
a
fair
artist
and
that
remarkable
american
adaptability
which
she
had
inherited
from
her
father
had
helped
her
in
many
ways
her
at
héronac
was
of
course
not
perfect
and
to
the
trained
eye
of
henry
fordyce
would
present
many
anomalies
but
no
one
could
deny
that
it
was
a
charming
apartment
or
that
it
was
a
glowing
frame
of
rich
tints
for
her
youthful
freshness
she
had
really
studied
in
these
years
of
her
residence
there
and
each
month
put
something
worth
having
into
the
storehouse
of
her
intelligent
mind
she
was
as
immeasurably
removed
from
the
sabine
delburg
of
convent
days
as
light
from
darkness
and
her
companion
had
often
been
monsieur
le
curé
an
enchanting
jesuit
priest
who
had
the
care
of
the
souls
of
héronac
village
a
great
cynic
a
pure
christian
and
a
man
of
parts
a
distant
connection
of
the
original
family
gaston
had
known
the
world
in
his
day
and
after
much
sorrow
had
found
a
hermitage
in
his
own
village
a
consolation
in
the
company
of
this
heiress
who
had
incorporated
herself
with
the
soil
he
was
now
seventy
years
of
age
and
always
a
gentleman
with
few
of
the
tiresome
habits
of
the
old
what
joy
he
had
found
in
opening
the
mind
of
his
young
dame
it
was
frankly
admitted
that
there
were
to
be
no
discussions
upon
religion
i
am
a
pagan
sabine
had
said
almost
immediately
leave
me
and
let
me
enjoy
your
sweet
church
and
your
fisherfolks
faith
i
will
come
there
every
sunday
and
say
my
prayers
prières
à
and
then
we
can
discuss
philosophy
afterwards
or
what
you
will
and
the
priest
had
replied
religion
is
not
of
dogma
the
paganism
of
dame
sabine
is
as
good
in
the
sight
of
le
bon
dieu
as
the
belief
of
jean
rivée
who
knows
that
his
boat
was
guided
into
the
harbor
on
the
night
of
the
great
storm
by
the
holy
virgin
who
posed
herself
by
the
helm
heavens
yes
it
is
god
who
judges
not
priests
it
can
be
easily
understood
that
with
two
minds
of
this
breadth
père
anselme
and
sabine
howard
became
real
friends
the
curé
when
he
read
with
her
the
masters
of
the
and
the
had
a
quaintly
humorous
expression
in
his
old
black
eye
not
for
girls
or
for
priests
but
for
gens
du
he
said
to
her
one
day
on
putting
down
a
volume
of
voltaire
of
what
matter
sabine
had
answered
since
i
am
not
a
girl
and
you
were
once
not
a
priest
and
we
are
both
du
monde
his
breeding
had
been
of
enormous
advantage
to
him
enabling
him
to
refrain
from
asking
sabine
a
single
question
but
he
knew
from
her
ejaculations
as
time
went
on
that
she
had
passed
through
some
furnace
during
her
eighteenth
year
and
it
had
seared
her
deeply
he
even
knew
more
than
this
he
knew
almost
as
much
as
simone
eventually
but
it
was
all
locked
in
his
breast
and
never
even
alluded
to
between
them
sabine
was
waiting
for
him
at
this
moment
upon
this
glorious
day
in
august
père
anselme
was
going
to
breakfast
with
her
he
was
announced
presently
courtly
and
spare
and
distinguished
in
his
soutane
and
they
went
in
to
the
a
round
chamber
in
the
adjoining
tower
which
had
kitchens
beneath
the
walls
were
here
so
thick
that
only
the
sky
could
be
seen
from
any
window
except
the
southeastern
one
from
which
you
reviewed
the
gray
slate
roofs
of
the
later
building
within
the
courtyard
the
part
which
had
been
always
habitable
and
which
contained
the
salons
and
the
guest
chambers
with
only
an
oblique
view
of
the
sea
here
in
mistress
own
apartments
the
waves
eternally
encircled
the
base
and
on
rough
days
rose
in
great
clouds
of
spray
almost
to
the
deep
mullions
i
am
having
visitors
père
anselme
sabine
remarked
when
nicholas
her
fat
butler
was
handing
the
omelette
madame
imogen
is
enchanted
and
she
smiled
at
that
lady
who
had
been
waiting
for
déjeuner
in
the
room
before
they
had
entered
mieux
responded
the
priest
with
his
mouth
full
of
egg
and
mushroom
in
his
youth
the
héronacs
had
not
imported
english
nurses
and
he
ate
as
his
fathers
had
done
before
him
so
much
the
better
our
lady
is
too
given
to
solitude
and
but
for
the
descents
of
the
princess
torniloni
and
her
tamed
father
he
used
the
word
père
we
should
here
see
very
little
of
the
outside
world
and
of
what
sex
madame
are
these
new
acquaintances
if
one
may
ask
they
are
men
bold
bad
englishmen
think
of
it
but
i
can
only
tell
you
the
name
of
one
of
them
the
other
is
problematical
he
has
merely
been
spoken
of
as
friend
but
he
is
young
i
gather
so
just
the
affaire
of
mère
imogen
why
that
likely
chirped
madame
imogen
with
a
strong
american
accent
in
her
french
english
but
i
do
pine
for
some
gay
things
down
here
do
you
father
père
anselme
was
heard
to
murmur
that
he
found
youth
enough
in
his
hostess
if
you
asked
him
at
the
same
time
we
must
welcome
these
englishmen
he
added
should
they
be
people
of
cultivation
he
had
heard
that
in
their
upper
classes
the
englishmen
of
were
still
the
greatest
gentlemen
left
and
he
would
be
pleased
to
meet
examples
of
them
they
will
arrive
at
about
five
i
suppose
sabine
announced
have
you
seen
about
their
rooms
mère
imogen
lord
fordyce
is
to
have
the
louis
xiv
suite
and
the
friend
the
one
beyond
and
we
will
only
let
them
come
into
our
house
if
they
do
not
bore
us
we
shall
dine
in
the
and
sit
in
the
big
salon
these
rooms
were
seldom
opened
except
when
princess
torniloni
came
to
stay
and
brought
her
son
sabine
godchild
who
had
elaborate
nurseries
prepared
for
him
no
other
visitor
had
ever
crossed
the
causeway
and
madame
imogen
cute
mind
was
asking
itself
why
clemency
had
been
accorded
to
these
two
britons
the
english
as
she
knew
were
not
a
favored
race
with
her
employer
they
had
been
together
for
about
two
years
now
she
and
sabine
and
were
excellent
friends
madame
imogen
aubert
had
been
in
great
straits
in
paris
when
sabine
had
heard
of
her
through
one
of
her
many
american
acquaintances
stupid
speculation
by
an
silly
french
husband
just
before
his
death
in
nevada
had
been
the
reason
madame
imogen
had
the
kindest
heart
and
the
hardest
common
sense
and
did
credit
to
a
distant
scotch
descent
she
adored
sabine
as
indeed
she
had
reason
to
do
and
looked
after
her
house
and
her
servants
with
a
hawk
eye
after
déjeuner
was
over
the
dame
and
the
curé
crossed
the
causeway
bridge
and
beyond
the
great
towered
gate
entered
another
at
the
side
which
conducted
them
into
the
garden
which
sheltered
itself
behind
immensely
big
walls
from
the
road
which
curled
beyond
it
and
the
sea
which
bounded
it
on
the
northwest
here
whatever
horticultural
talent
and
money
could
procure
had
been
lavished
for
four
years
and
the
results
were
beginning
to
show
it
was
a
glorious
mass
of
summer
flowers
and
was
the
supreme
pleasure
of
père
anselme
he
gardened
with
the
fervor
of
an
enthusiast
and
was
the
joy
and
terror
of
the
gardeners
they
spent
two
hours
in
delightful
work
and
then
the
curé
went
his
way
but
just
before
he
left
for
the
hundred
yards
down
the
road
where
his
cottage
stood
sabine
said
to
him
regard
well
lord
fordyce
it
is
possible
i
may
decide
to
know
him
very
intimately
some
day
when
i
am
free
the
old
priest
looked
at
her
questioningly
you
intend
to
remove
your
shackles
yourself
then
my
child
you
will
not
leave
the
affair
to
the
good
god
no
i
think
that
it
will
be
wiser
that
i
should
be
free
soon
bon
helps
those
who
help
themselves
au
revoir
and
do
not
be
late
for
the
englishmen
the
priest
shrugged
his
high
shoulders
as
he
walked
off
the
dear
child
he
said
to
himself
she
does
not
know
it
but
the
image
of
the
fierce
one
has
not
faded
entirely
even
yet
it
is
natural
though
that
she
should
think
of
a
mate
i
must
well
examine
this
englishman
sabine
went
back
into
the
walled
garden
again
and
sat
down
under
the
shelter
of
an
arbour
of
green
she
wanted
to
a
letter
of
henry
fordyce
which
she
had
received
that
day
by
the
early
and
only
post
it
was
rather
a
perfect
letter
for
any
young
woman
to
have
got
and
she
knew
that
and
valued
all
its
literary
and
artistic
merits
they
had
had
long
and
frequent
conversations
in
their
last
three
days
at
carlsbad
during
which
they
had
grown
nearer
and
still
better
friends
his
gentleness
his
courtesy
and
diffidence
were
such
incense
to
her
considering
the
position
of
importance
he
held
in
his
own
country
and
the
great
place
he
seemed
to
occupy
in
the
princess
regard
and
he
was
her
servant
her
slave
and
would
certainly
make
the
most
tender
lover
some
day
on
their
last
afternoon
he
had
taken
her
hands
and
kissed
them
sabine
he
had
said
with
his
voice
trembling
with
emotion
i
have
shown
you
that
i
can
control
myself
and
have
not
made
any
love
to
you
as
i
have
longed
to
do
wo
you
be
generous
dearest
and
give
me
some
definite
hope
some
definite
promise
that
when
you
are
free
you
will
give
yourself
to
me
and
will
be
my
wife
and
she
had
answered
with
more
fervor
than
she
really
felt
because
she
would
hide
some
unaccountable
reluctance
yes
i
have
written
to
my
lawyer
parsons
to
advise
me
how
to
begin
to
take
the
necessary
steps
and
when
it
all
goes
through
then
yes
i
will
marry
you
but
she
would
not
let
him
kiss
her
which
he
showed
signs
of
desiring
to
do
you
must
wait
until
i
am
free
though
my
marriage
is
no
tie
it
has
never
been
one
after
the
first
year
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
if
you
want
to
hear
it
but
i
wish
to
forget
it
all
only
it
is
fair
for
you
to
know
there
is
no
disgrace
connected
with
it
in
any
way
i
should
not
care
one
atom
if
there
were
henry
said
ecstatically
you
yourself
could
never
have
touched
any
disgrace
your
eyes
are
as
pure
as
the
stars
i
was
extremely
ignorant
and
foolish
as
one
is
at
seventeen
and
now
i
want
to
make
something
of
life
some
great
thing
and
your
goodness
and
your
high
and
fine
ideals
will
help
me
my
dearest
he
had
cried
fervently
sabine
had
said
to
the
princess
that
night
as
they
talked
in
their
do
you
know
morri
i
have
almost
decided
to
marry
this
englishman
some
day
you
have
often
told
me
i
was
foolish
not
to
free
myself
from
any
bonds
however
lightly
they
held
me
and
i
have
never
wanted
to
but
now
i
do
at
once
as
soon
as
possible
before
my
husband
can
suggest
being
free
of
me
i
have
written
to
parsons
already
and
i
suppose
it
will
not
take
very
long
the
laws
there
i
believe
are
not
so
binding
as
in
england
and
then
she
stopped
short
the
laws
where
moravia
could
not
refrain
from
asking
her
curiosity
had
at
last
won
the
day
in
scotland
morri
he
was
a
scotchman
not
an
american
at
all
as
every
one
supposes
the
princess
eyes
opened
wide
and
she
had
to
bite
her
lips
to
keep
from
asking
more
i
have
never
seen
him
since
the
day
after
we
were
married
there
can
not
be
any
difficulty
about
getting
a
divorce
can
there
none
i
should
think
the
princess
said
shortly
and
they
kissed
one
another
and
each
went
to
her
room
but
moravia
sat
a
long
time
after
her
maid
had
left
her
staring
into
space
fate
was
very
cruel
and
contrary
it
gave
her
everything
that
most
people
could
want
and
refused
her
the
one
thing
she
desired
herself
he
adores
sabine
who
will
trample
on
him
she
always
rules
everything
and
i
would
have
been
his
sympathetic
companion
and
would
have
let
him
rule
me
then
something
she
could
not
reconcile
in
her
mind
struck
her
if
sabine
had
never
seen
her
husband
since
the
day
after
she
was
married
what
had
caused
her
to
be
so
pale
and
sad
and
utterly
changed
when
she
came
to
her
moravia
in
rome
a
year
or
more
afterwards
and
to
have
made
her
break
entirely
with
her
uncle
and
aunt
the
secret
of
her
friend
life
lay
in
that
year
that
year
after
she
herself
married
and
went
off
with
her
husband
girolamo
to
italy
the
year
which
sabine
had
spent
in
america
alone
but
she
knew
very
well
that
fond
as
they
were
of
one
another
sabine
would
probably
never
tell
her
about
it
so
presently
she
got
into
bed
and
sighing
at
the
incongruity
and
inconsiderateness
of
circumstance
she
turned
out
the
light
sabine
that
same
night
read
of
further
entertainments
at
ostende
in
the
york
and
shut
her
full
firm
lips
with
an
ominous
force
and
so
she
and
henry
had
parted
at
the
carlsbad
station
next
day
with
the
understanding
between
them
that
when
sabine
could
tell
him
that
she
was
free
he
would
be
at
liberty
to
press
his
suit
and
she
would
give
a
favorable
answer
she
thought
of
these
past
things
now
for
a
moment
while
she
lord
fordyce
letter
it
told
her
there
in
her
héronac
garden
in
a
hurried
that
a
friend
had
joined
him
that
moment
at
havre
and
clamored
to
be
taken
on
the
trip
too
claiming
an
old
promise
he
was
quite
a
nice
young
man
but
if
she
did
not
want
any
extra
person
she
was
to
wire
to
where
they
would
arrive
about
eleven
and
there
this
interloper
should
be
ruthlessly
marooned
the
post
had
evidently
been
going
and
the
must
have
been
written
in
frightful
haste
after
the
advent
of
the
friend
for
his
name
was
not
even
given
sabine
had
not
wired
she
felt
a
certain
sense
of
relief
it
would
make
someone
to
talk
to
madame
imogen
and
the
curé
and
cause
there
to
be
no
then
her
thoughts
turned
to
henry
himself
with
tender
friendship
so
dear
a
companion
and
how
glad
she
would
be
to
see
him
again
the
ten
days
since
they
had
parted
at
carlsbad
seemed
actually
long
surely
it
was
a
wise
thing
to
do
to
start
her
real
life
with
one
whom
she
could
so
truly
respect
there
could
be
no
pitfalls
and
disappointments
and
his
great
position
in
england
would
give
scope
for
her
ambition
which
never
could
be
satisfied
like
moravia
with
just
social
things
she
would
begin
to
study
english
politics
and
the
other
great
matters
which
henry
was
interested
in
he
would
find
that
what
she
had
told
him
at
carlsbad
was
true
and
that
although
he
was
naturally
prejudiced
against
americans
he
would
have
to
admit
that
she
as
his
wife
played
the
part
as
well
if
not
better
than
one
of
his
own
countrywomen
could
have
done
she
thrilled
a
little
as
the
picture
came
up
before
her
of
the
large
outlook
she
would
have
to
survey
and
the
great
situation
she
would
have
to
adorn
but
sure
of
henry
devoted
kindness
and
gentleness
all
the
time
yes
she
would
certainly
marry
him
perhaps
by
next
year
parsons
had
written
only
yesterday
saying
he
had
begun
to
take
steps
as
her
freedom
must
come
from
the
side
of
her
husband
who
could
divorce
her
for
desertion
she
could
not
urge
this
plea
against
him
since
she
had
left
him
of
her
own
free
will
he
will
jump
at
the
chance
naturally
she
said
to
herself
and
then
perhaps
he
will
marry
daisy
van
der
horn
she
was
still
a
very
young
woman
you
see
for
all
her
four
years
of
deep
education
in
the
world
of
books
she
put
the
letter
back
in
her
basket
below
the
flowers
she
had
picked
and
prepared
to
return
to
the
château
to
arrange
various
combinations
of
color
in
vases
was
her
peculiar
joy
and
her
flower
decorations
were
her
special
care
she
was
just
entering
the
great
towered
gate
of
héronac
where
resided
the
concierge
when
she
heard
the
whir
of
a
motor
approaching
in
the
distance
and
she
hurriedly
slipped
inside
old
berthe
parlor
she
disliked
dust
and
strangers
who
fortunately
very
seldom
came
upon
this
unbeaten
track
she
was
watching
from
the
window
until
they
should
have
passed
it
could
not
be
her
guests
it
was
quite
an
hour
too
soon
when
the
motor
whizzed
round
the
bend
and
stopped
short
at
the
gate
it
was
a
big
open
one
and
the
occupants
wore
goggles
over
their
eyes
but
she
recognized
lord
fordyce
figure
as
he
got
out
followed
by
a
very
tall
young
man
who
called
out
cheerily
yes
this
must
be
the
brigand
stronghold
henry
let
thunder
at
the
bell
then
for
a
moment
her
knees
gave
way
beneath
her
and
she
sank
into
berthe
carved
oaken
chair
for
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
michael
arranstoun
and
when
he
pulled
the
goggles
off
she
could
see
as
she
peered
through
the
window
his
sunburnt
face
and
bold
blue
eyes
chapter
ix
ostende
had
begun
to
bore
michael
arranstoun
intolerably
he
had
lamed
his
best
pony
and
miss
daisy
van
der
horn
was
getting
on
his
nerves
at
ostende
she
to
use
one
of
her
own
expressions
was
not
the
only
pebble
on
the
beach
his
nerves
had
had
a
good
deal
of
exercise
among
that
exceedingly
frolicsome
crew
five
years
in
the
wilds
had
not
changed
him
much
except
to
add
to
his
annoying
charm
he
was
more
absolutely
and
sure
of
himself
and
careless
of
all
else
than
ever
miss
daisy
van
der
horn
and
a
number
of
clarices
and
germaines
and
lolos
were
just
crazy
about
him
and
they
mattered
to
him
not
a
single
straw
he
laughed
and
kissed
them
when
he
felt
inclined
and
then
when
all
had
begun
to
weary
him
he
rode
away
or
rather
sent
his
polo
ponies
back
to
england
and
got
into
the
express
for
paris
expecting
there
to
find
henry
fordyce
returned
from
carlsbad
only
to
hear
that
he
had
just
started
in
his
motor
for
brittany
and
by
that
evening
would
have
arrived
at
havre
michael
had
nothing
special
to
do
and
so
followed
him
there
at
once
by
train
coming
upon
him
just
as
he
was
closing
his
letter
to
howard
then
in
his
usual
whirlwind
way
which
must
be
obeyed
he
had
persuaded
henry
to
take
him
on
with
him
inwardly
against
that
astute
politician
but
diffident
lover
will
look
here
michael
he
had
said
i
am
going
to
see
the
lady
of
my
heart
you
know
and
you
will
probably
be
in
the
way
not
a
bit
old
boy
i
play
the
helpful
friend
and
spin
things
along
what
she
like
here
lord
fordyce
gave
a
guarded
description
but
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
man
who
is
no
longer
quite
young
but
madly
in
love
good
lord
whistled
michael
she
must
be
a
daisy
and
when
are
you
going
to
be
married
old
man
i
lend
you
arranstoun
for
the
honeymoon
damned
good
place
for
a
honeymoon
and
then
he
stopped
short
suddenly
and
laughed
with
a
strange
regretful
sound
in
his
mirth
alas
henry
sighed
i
can
not
say
she
is
an
american
you
know
and
has
been
married
to
a
brute
of
her
own
nation
out
west
whom
she
has
to
get
perfectly
free
of
before
i
can
have
the
honor
to
call
her
mine
whew
yes
it
is
a
dreadful
bore
having
to
wait
they
arrange
divorces
wonderfully
well
over
there
though
it
is
only
a
question
of
a
few
months
i
suppose
but
she
would
be
worth
waiting
for
for
ten
years
it
is
simply
glorious
to
hear
you
raving
so
old
bird
michael
laughed
when
i
think
of
the
lectures
you
used
to
give
me
about
women
mere
recreations
for
a
man
leisure
moments
i
think
you
called
them
and
not
to
be
taken
seriously
in
a
man
real
life
i
have
completely
changed
my
opinions
lord
fordyce
announced
rather
nettled
so
would
any
man
if
he
knew
mrs
howard
howard
asked
michael
but
anyone
can
be
a
talbot
or
a
howard
or
a
cavendish
out
there
so
she
is
a
howard
is
she
i
wonder
who
the
husband
was
i
had
a
rascally
cousin
of
that
name
who
went
to
arizona
perhaps
she
married
him
her
husband
was
an
american
henry
rejoined
and
is
in
a
madhouse
or
an
institution
for
inebriates
i
believe
well
i
wish
you
all
joy
henry
i
do
indeed
and
i
promise
you
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
help
you
through
with
it
i
wo
retaliate
for
your
thundering
niggardness
five
years
ago
when
you
would
not
even
be
my
best
man
do
you
remember
this
is
quite
different
my
dear
boy
lord
fordyce
assured
him
with
dignity
you
were
going
to
do
what
i
thought
a
most
casual
thing
just
for
your
own
ends
but
i
michael
and
his
cultivated
voice
vibrated
with
feeling
i
love
this
woman
as
i
never
thought
i
should
love
anything
on
god
earth
then
here
to
you
said
arranstoun
and
ringing
the
bell
for
the
waiter
ordered
a
pint
of
champagne
to
drink
his
friend
health
so
they
had
started
in
the
motor
after
breakfast
next
day
and
that
night
slept
at
malo
getting
to
héronac
without
adventure
the
following
afternoon
when
no
telegram
was
awaiting
lord
fordyce
at
where
they
breakfasted
he
remarked
to
michael
she
does
not
mind
your
coming
or
she
would
have
wired
i
wish
i
were
as
indifferent
about
it
michael
and
henry
stammered
a
little
you
promise
me
as
a
friend
you
will
not
look
into
her
eyes
with
your
confounded
blue
ones
and
try
to
cut
me
out
for
some
reason
this
appeal
touched
something
in
michael
heart
his
voice
was
full
of
cordiality
and
his
blue
bold
eyes
swam
with
kindly
affection
as
he
answered
i
not
a
beast
henry
and
i
do
want
every
woman
i
see
and
anyone
you
fancied
would
in
any
case
be
sacred
to
me
and
he
held
out
his
hand
give
you
my
word
as
i
told
you
before
i
not
only
promise
you
on
my
honor
that
i
not
cut
in
myself
but
i
do
everything
i
can
to
help
you
old
man
then
he
laughed
to
hide
the
seriousness
of
his
feeling
even
to
lending
arranstoun
for
the
honeymoon
so
they
grasped
hands
and
sealed
the
bargain
and
got
into
the
motor
and
went
on
their
way
the
first
view
of
héronac
had
enchanted
them
both
it
was
indeed
a
unique
place
what
taste
henry
had
said
fancy
a
young
woman
knowing
and
seeing
at
once
the
possibilities
of
such
a
place
it
is
as
grim
as
arranstoun
and
nearly
as
old
michael
exclaimed
i
am
glad
we
came
sabine
shrank
back
into
berthe
little
kitchen
and
signalled
to
her
not
to
make
known
the
hostess
presence
but
to
let
the
gentlemen
drive
over
the
causeway
bridge
to
the
courtyard
where
they
would
be
told
by
nicholas
that
she
was
in
the
garden
and
would
probably
be
brought
there
to
her
by
madame
imogen
who
would
have
welcomed
them
her
firm
will
forced
her
to
pull
herself
together
and
decide
what
to
do
when
they
should
come
face
to
face
to
be
totally
unconcerned
was
the
best
thing
to
look
and
act
as
though
michael
arranstoun
were
indeed
a
perfect
stranger
introduced
to
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
it
would
take
him
some
moments
to
be
certain
that
she
was
sabine
his
wife
and
he
would
then
not
be
likely
to
make
a
scene
before
henry
and
when
the
moment
for
plain
speaking
came
she
would
sternly
demand
to
be
set
free
she
had
kept
silence
to
henry
as
to
who
her
husband
really
was
for
no
reason
except
that
the
whole
subject
disturbed
her
greatly
the
very
mention
of
michael
name
or
the
thought
of
him
always
filling
her
with
wild
and
mixed
emotions
she
had
schooled
herself
in
the
years
that
had
gone
by
since
their
parting
into
absolutely
banishing
his
memory
every
time
it
recurred
she
had
a
vague
feeling
that
she
must
be
free
of
him
and
safe
before
she
could
even
pronounce
his
name
to
lord
fordyce
who
naturally
must
know
eventually
there
was
an
unaccountable
and
not
understood
fear
in
her
fear
that
in
the
discussion
which
must
arise
if
she
spoke
of
who
her
husband
was
to
henry
that
something
might
transpire
or
that
she
might
hear
something
which
would
reawaken
certain
emotions
and
weaken
her
determination
to
break
the
even
empty
bond
with
michael
and
now
she
had
seen
him
again
with
her
mortal
eyes
and
she
knew
that
she
was
trembling
and
tingling
with
a
mad
sensation
of
she
knew
not
what
hatred
and
revulsion
she
hoped
but
was
only
sure
of
one
aspect
of
it
that
of
wild
excitement
no
one
not
a
single
soul
neither
simone
madame
imogen
nor
père
anselme
himself
must
be
allowed
to
see
that
she
recognized
michael
her
belief
that
her
countrywomen
were
fine
actresses
should
stand
her
in
good
stead
and
enable
her
to
play
this
part
of
unconsciousness
to
perfection
conquer
herself
and
she
stamped
her
little
foot
there
in
the
high
turret
bower
in
the
garden
where
she
had
retired
its
windows
opened
straight
out
to
the
sea
and
she
often
had
tea
there
there
would
be
no
use
in
all
her
prayers
for
calm
and
poise
if
they
should
desert
her
now
in
this
great
crisis
of
her
life
she
was
bound
to
henry
by
her
promised
word
given
of
her
own
free
will
and
she
meant
to
keep
it
and
do
everything
in
her
power
to
make
herself
free
she
was
an
extremely
honest
person
honest
even
with
herself
and
she
realized
that
either
her
own
weakness
or
indecision
or
some
other
motive
had
forced
her
to
give
a
definite
answer
to
lord
fordyce
and
that
he
was
too
fine
a
character
to
be
played
with
and
tossed
about
because
of
her
moods
she
had
mastered
every
sign
of
emotion
by
the
time
madame
comfortable
figure
accompanied
by
the
two
men
could
be
seen
advancing
in
the
distance
she
rose
with
the
gracious
smile
of
a
hostess
and
held
out
her
hand
pleased
surprise
upon
her
face
so
you
have
come
but
earlier
than
i
thought
and
she
shook
hands
with
henry
and
then
turned
to
his
friend
without
the
slightest
embarrassment
as
lord
fordyce
spoke
his
name
how
do
you
do
she
said
politely
you
are
both
very
welcome
to
héronac
michael
had
merely
seen
a
pretty
outline
of
a
young
woman
until
they
had
got
quite
close
and
she
had
raised
her
head
and
lifted
the
shadow
of
her
big
garden
and
then
he
stiffened
suddenly
and
grew
very
pale
he
was
a
little
behind
the
other
two
and
they
observed
nothing
but
sabine
saw
the
change
of
color
in
his
healthy
handsome
face
and
the
look
of
surprise
and
incredulity
and
puzzle
which
grew
in
his
blue
eyes
how
do
you
do
he
murmured
and
then
pulled
himself
together
and
looked
at
her
hard
but
she
stood
his
scrutiny
with
perfect
unconcern
even
meeting
his
eye
with
a
blank
agreeable
want
of
recognition
while
she
made
some
ordinary
remark
about
their
journey
then
pointing
to
her
basket
see
i
was
picking
flowers
for
my
and
i
did
not
expect
you
for
another
hour
what
a
silent
motor
you
must
have
that
its
noise
did
not
penetrate
here
henry
was
so
overcome
with
joy
to
see
her
and
that
she
should
be
so
gracious
and
sweet
he
said
all
sorts
of
nice
things
and
walked
by
her
side
as
they
came
down
from
the
turret
she
looked
the
picture
of
a
fresh
june
rose
as
she
carried
her
basket
full
of
august
flowers
phloxes
and
penstemons
and
a
great
bunch
of
late
sweet
peas
and
michael
felt
almost
that
he
was
staggering
a
little
as
he
followed
with
madame
imogen
the
shock
had
been
so
great
was
it
really
sabine
his
wife
or
could
she
have
a
double
in
the
world
maddening
uncertainty
was
his
portion
he
must
know
he
must
be
certain
and
if
she
were
his
wife
what
then
what
did
it
mean
he
could
not
claim
her
she
was
engaged
to
henry
his
friend
to
whom
he
had
given
his
word
of
honor
that
he
would
help
as
much
as
he
could
it
was
no
wonder
that
he
answered
madame
imogen
prattle
crisp
and
american
and
amusing
though
it
was
quite
at
random
his
whole
attention
being
upon
the
pair
in
front
sabine
also
found
that
she
was
not
hearing
a
word
henry
said
but
that
the
wildest
excitement
which
she
had
ever
known
was
coursing
through
her
blood
at
last
she
did
catch
that
he
was
telling
her
that
never
had
she
been
more
beautiful
or
had
brighter
eyes
this
place
must
suit
you
even
better
than
carlsbad
he
said
she
answered
laughingly
and
led
the
way
toward
the
gate
and
so
across
the
causeway
and
on
into
her
own
where
they
would
find
tea
she
supposed
afterwards
that
she
had
talked
sensibly
but
never
had
any
recollection
of
what
she
had
said
the
room
was
looking
singularly
beautiful
with
the
wonderful
coloring
of
the
splendid
curtains
and
the
tapestry
and
dark
wood
and
it
was
a
homely
place
too
with
quantities
of
and
comfortable
chairs
for
all
its
vast
size
michael
thought
there
was
a
faint
look
of
his
own
room
at
arranstoun
and
he
joined
the
two
who
had
advanced
to
one
of
the
huge
embrasures
of
the
windows
where
the
tea
table
was
laid
here
there
were
window
seats
where
one
could
lounge
and
gaze
out
at
the
sea
what
an
exquisite
place
he
exclaimed
it
reminds
me
of
arranstoun
does
it
not
you
henry
although
that
is
not
near
the
sea
the
color
deepened
in
sabine
cheeks
had
she
unconsciously
made
it
resemble
that
place
she
did
not
know
and
the
suggestion
struck
her
with
surprise
michael
had
recognized
her
of
course
she
saw
that
but
he
was
a
gentleman
and
intended
to
play
the
game
that
was
an
immense
relief
she
could
allow
herself
to
look
at
him
critically
now
not
with
just
the
cursory
glance
she
had
bestowed
upon
henry
friend
at
first
for
he
had
turned
and
was
talking
to
madame
imogen
whom
sabine
had
signed
to
pour
out
the
tea
she
was
not
sure
if
her
own
hand
might
not
have
shaken
a
little
and
it
were
wiser
to
take
no
risks
he
was
horribly
that
jumped
to
the
eye
and
with
a
careless
indifferent
grace
five
years
had
only
matured
and
increased
his
attractions
he
had
it
manifesting
in
every
part
of
him
and
his
atmosphere
a
magnetism
a
hateful
odious
power
which
she
felt
and
fiercely
resented
he
had
recovered
completely
from
whatever
shock
he
had
felt
upon
seeing
her
it
would
seem
for
his
face
looked
absolutely
unconcerned
now
and
perfectly
at
ease
she
called
all
her
forces
together
and
played
the
part
of
the
radiant
hostess
being
even
extra
sweet
and
charming
to
henry
who
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
in
consequence
the
dreaded
introduction
of
his
friend
at
héronac
had
passed
off
well
and
his
adored
lady
did
not
seem
to
be
taking
any
notice
of
him
michael
did
not
seek
by
word
or
look
to
engage
her
in
personal
conversation
if
he
had
really
been
a
stranger
who
did
not
even
find
his
hostess
fair
he
could
not
have
been
more
casual
or
less
impressed
and
all
the
while
his
pulses
were
bounding
and
he
was
growing
more
and
more
filled
with
astonishment
and
emotion
at
last
a
thought
came
why
of
course
henry
had
told
her
he
was
coming
so
she
had
expected
the
meeting
and
had
had
time
to
school
herself
to
act
but
this
straw
was
not
long
vouchsafed
him
and
then
stupefaction
set
in
for
henry
chanced
to
say
you
must
forgive
me
for
not
having
time
to
write
you
my
friend
name
in
my
postscript
the
post
was
off
that
minute
you
had
to
take
him
on
trust
i
do
not
know
that
i
even
caught
it
just
now
sabine
returned
archly
mr
and
henry
engaged
for
a
moment
taking
a
second
cup
of
tea
from
madame
imogen
fat
hand
michael
answered
for
him
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
michael
howard
arranstoun
of
arranstoun
over
the
border
in
scotland
like
gretna
green
how
romantic
that
sounds
madame
imogen
chimed
in
why
it
a
name
fit
for
a
stage
play
i
do
think
a
party
of
my
friends
visited
that
very
castle
only
last
fall
howard
dear
it
as
well
known
as
the
trossachs
to
investigators
of
the
antique
wonderfully
interesting
sabine
remarked
blandly
putting
more
sugar
in
her
tea
at
which
michael
eyebrows
raised
themselves
in
a
whimsical
way
back
had
rushed
to
him
the
recollection
that
on
the
only
occasion
they
had
ever
drunk
tea
together
before
she
had
said
that
she
liked
lumps
and
lumps
of
it
you
probably
know
england
he
hazarded
politely
very
little
i
was
once
there
for
a
month
when
i
was
a
child
we
went
to
see
windermere
and
the
lakes
you
got
no
further
north
that
was
a
pity
our
country
is
most
beautiful
but
it
is
not
too
late
you
may
go
there
yet
some
day
who
knows
and
she
laughed
gaily
she
had
to
allow
herself
some
outlet
she
felt
she
would
otherwise
have
screamed
michael
looked
away
out
to
sea
and
he
told
himself
he
must
not
tease
her
any
more
she
was
astonishingly
game
so
astonishingly
game
that
but
for
the
name
howard
he
could
have
almost
believed
that
this
young
woman
was
his
sabine
double
but
he
remembered
now
that
she
had
said
she
was
going
to
call
herself
howard
because
otherwise
she
would
not
be
able
to
have
any
fun
he
had
never
recollected
it
since
not
even
when
henry
had
told
him
the
lady
of
his
heart
was
called
howard
obscured
by
his
friend
assertion
that
her
husband
was
an
american
he
had
not
for
an
instant
suspected
the
least
connection
with
himself
until
he
could
find
out
the
meaning
of
all
this
comedy
he
must
not
let
henry
have
an
idea
that
there
was
anything
underneath
and
then
with
a
pang
of
mortification
and
pain
he
remembered
his
promise
to
henry
and
he
clenched
his
hands
in
his
coat
pockets
he
was
indeed
tied
and
bound
sabine
for
her
part
felt
she
could
bear
the
situation
no
longer
she
must
be
alone
so
on
the
plea
of
letters
to
write
she
dismissed
them
with
madame
imogen
to
show
them
to
their
rooms
in
the
other
part
of
the
house
which
was
connected
to
this
her
two
great
turrets
and
middle
immense
room
by
a
passage
which
went
along
from
the
turret
which
contained
her
bedroom
you
wo
mind
perhaps
dining
at
half
past
seven
she
said
as
she
paused
at
her
door
because
our
good
curé
père
anselme
is
coming
and
he
hates
to
sit
up
late
and
with
the
corner
of
his
eye
michael
saw
that
before
he
hurried
after
him
henry
had
bent
and
surreptitiously
kissed
his
hostess
hand
and
a
sudden
blinding
unreasoning
rage
shook
him
as
he
stalked
on
to
his
allotted
apartment
chapter
x
sabine
decided
to
be
a
little
late
for
dinner
three
minutes
just
to
give
the
rest
of
the
party
time
to
be
assembled
in
the
big
salon
she
was
coming
from
the
communicating
passage
to
her
part
of
the
house
when
arranstoun
came
out
of
his
room
and
they
were
obliged
to
go
down
the
great
staircase
together
to
see
him
suddenly
in
evening
dress
like
this
brought
her
wedding
night
back
so
vividly
to
her
she
with
difficulty
kept
a
gasp
from
her
breath
he
was
certainly
the
most
splendidly
creature
with
his
blue
eyes
and
dark
hair
and
much
fairer
little
moustache
i
am
late
she
cried
laughing
before
he
could
speak
a
word
père
anselme
will
scold
me
come
along
and
she
tripped
forward
with
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
michael
eyes
blazed
she
was
a
truly
bewitching
morsel
in
her
fresh
white
frock
with
its
bunch
of
crimson
sweet
peas
stuck
in
the
belt
your
flowers
should
be
stephanotis
he
said
and
that
was
all
as
he
followed
her
down
the
stairs
i
can
not
bear
them
she
retorted
and
shuddered
a
little
i
only
care
for
simple
things
like
my
sweet
peas
he
did
not
speak
as
they
went
along
the
gallery
this
disconcerted
her
what
did
it
mean
she
had
been
prepared
to
fence
with
him
and
keep
him
in
his
place
she
was
ready
to
defend
herself
on
all
sides
and
no
defence
seemed
necessary
a
sudden
cold
feeling
came
over
her
as
though
excitement
had
died
down
and
she
opened
the
salon
door
quickly
and
advanced
into
the
room
michael
had
come
to
a
determination
while
dressing
henry
had
walked
in
and
smoked
a
cigarette
with
him
before
he
began
and
had
then
showed
plainly
his
joy
and
satisfaction
she
his
worshiped
lady
had
never
before
been
so
tender
and
gracious
and
he
was
awfully
happy
because
things
were
going
well
and
what
did
his
friend
michael
think
of
his
choice
was
she
not
the
sweetest
woman
in
the
world
michael
said
he
had
seen
ones
but
admitted
she
had
charm
he
was
really
suffering
the
situation
was
so
impossible
and
he
had
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
what
he
ought
to
do
tell
henry
straight
out
that
sabine
was
his
wife
or
what
if
he
did
that
he
might
be
going
contrary
to
some
plan
of
hers
for
she
evidently
had
no
intention
yet
of
informing
lord
fordyce
or
of
giving
the
least
indication
that
she
recognized
him
michael
it
was
the
most
grotesque
puzzle
and
contained
an
element
of
the
tragic
too
for
one
of
them
henry
happiness
and
contentment
touched
him
his
dear
old
friend
he
felt
extraordinarily
upset
but
when
lord
fordyce
had
gone
he
rapidly
reviewed
matters
and
made
up
his
mind
at
all
events
for
the
present
he
would
be
guided
by
what
sabine
attitude
should
be
herself
he
would
certainly
see
her
alone
on
the
following
day
and
then
she
would
most
likely
broach
the
subject
and
they
could
agree
what
to
do
for
that
henry
must
know
some
day
was
an
incontestable
fact
he
michael
would
make
some
excuse
and
leave
héronac
by
the
next
evening
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
playing
such
a
part
and
not
fair
to
any
one
least
of
all
to
his
friend
i
will
give
her
to
declare
her
hand
he
thought
as
his
valet
no
longer
the
dignified
johnson
handed
him
his
coat
and
then
if
she
will
not
put
the
cards
down
i
must
but
when
he
opened
his
door
and
saw
her
exquisite
slender
figure
tripping
forward
from
the
dark
passage
a
fierce
pain
gripped
his
heart
and
he
said
between
his
teeth
my
god
if
it
had
not
been
too
late
the
dame
was
in
wild
spirits
at
dinner
and
her
cheeks
burned
like
glowing
roses
monsieur
le
curé
watched
her
with
his
wise
black
eye
the
child
is
not
herself
he
thought
it
is
possible
that
this
englishman
may
mean
a
great
deal
to
her
but
he
is
of
the
gentle
type
not
of
the
sort
one
would
believe
to
make
strong
passions
no
now
if
it
had
been
the
other
one
the
friend
that
one
could
have
seen
some
light
through
a
young
man
well
able
to
fill
the
heart
of
any
woman
a
fine
young
man
a
splendid
young
man
but
yes
madame
imogen
made
no
reflections
she
was
too
delighted
with
their
gay
repast
and
helped
with
her
jolly
wit
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
henry
felt
slightly
intoxicated
with
happiness
while
in
michael
passions
of
various
sorts
were
rising
against
his
will
a
devil
was
in
sabine
never
had
she
been
so
alluring
so
feminine
so
completely
removed
from
her
usual
grave
indifferent
self
she
did
not
look
at
michael
once
or
vouchsafe
him
any
conversation
beyond
what
cordial
politeness
compelled
it
was
to
père
anselme
that
she
almost
made
love
with
shy
sallies
at
henry
and
merry
replies
to
madame
imogen
but
her
whole
atmosphere
was
radiating
with
provoking
fascination
and
as
they
all
rose
from
table
she
took
lord
arm
in
england
i
hear
you
men
remain
in
the
dining
room
to
drink
all
sorts
of
ports
but
here
in
my
france
we
expect
you
to
be
sociable
and
come
with
us
at
once
you
may
smoke
where
you
choose
henry
could
not
refrain
from
caressing
with
his
other
hand
the
little
cold
one
lying
on
his
arm
as
they
walked
along
while
he
whispered
with
passionate
devotion
my
darling
darling
girl
hush
she
answered
nervously
your
friend
will
hear
and
if
he
does
what
matter
dearest
he
knows
that
i
love
you
and
that
as
soon
as
you
are
free
you
are
going
to
be
my
wife
there
must
have
been
a
slight
roughness
in
the
carpet
which
slid
upon
the
slippery
floor
for
the
dame
stumbled
a
little
and
then
gasped
he
knows
that
and
by
the
time
they
all
reached
the
salon
her
rosy
cheeks
were
pale
while
the
pupils
of
her
violet
eyes
were
so
large
as
to
make
them
appear
to
be
black
as
night
the
gay
sprite
of
the
seemed
to
have
taken
her
departure
and
a
dignified
and
serious
hostess
filled
her
place
a
hostess
who
discoursed
of
gardens
and
architecture
and
such
subjects
and
at
ten
when
the
père
anselme
gave
his
blessing
and
wished
the
company
also
gave
a
white
hand
to
her
guests
saying
that
madame
imogen
would
show
them
the
small
salon
where
they
could
smoke
and
have
their
drinks
before
retiring
to
their
rooms
then
she
bowed
to
them
and
walked
off
slowly
to
her
part
of
the
house
when
she
had
gone
michael
said
a
little
hoarsely
to
henry
i
have
got
the
fiend
of
a
headache
old
man
i
think
i
wo
smoke
but
turn
in
at
once
an
hour
or
two
later
when
the
whole
château
was
wrapped
in
darkness
the
mistress
of
it
crept
from
her
to
the
great
and
turning
on
the
light
she
unlocked
a
blue
which
stood
beside
her
from
this
she
took
a
letter
marked
a
little
with
former
perusals
and
she
read
it
over
once
more
from
beginning
to
end
it
had
arranstoun
castle
scotland
stamped
upon
it
in
red
and
it
bore
a
date
in
june
it
had
no
beginning
and
thus
it
ran
since
after
everything
i
wake
to
find
you
have
chosen
to
leave
me
you
can
abide
by
your
decision
i
will
not
follow
you
or
ever
seek
to
bring
you
back
it
is
useless
to
ask
you
if
you
meant
that
you
forgave
me
because
your
going
proves
that
you
really
have
not
so
make
what
you
please
of
your
life
as
i
shall
make
what
i
please
of
mine
michael
arranstoun
when
she
put
the
paper
back
again
glittering
tears
gathered
and
rolled
in
shining
drops
down
her
cheeks
he
had
meant
that
last
paragraph
then
and
he
meant
it
now
evidently
since
he
knew
that
she
was
pledged
to
marry
henry
when
she
should
be
free
and
had
made
no
protest
perhaps
he
was
glad
and
intended
to
marry
miss
daisy
van
der
horn
her
tears
dried
suddenly
and
her
cheeks
burned
she
must
think
this
situation
out
and
not
just
drift
it
was
plain
that
michael
had
been
astonished
to
the
point
of
stupefaction
on
seeing
her
he
could
not
have
known
then
that
his
friend
wished
to
marry
her
sabine
only
that
his
friend
wished
to
marry
the
lady
they
were
going
to
see
but
he
knew
it
afterwards
he
knew
it
at
dinner
and
yet
he
said
never
a
word
what
could
it
mean
what
could
be
best
to
do
perhaps
to
see
him
alone
in
the
morning
and
ask
him
to
grant
her
freedom
and
get
the
divorce
as
quickly
as
possible
she
could
count
upon
herself
not
to
betray
the
slightest
feeling
in
the
interview
if
only
that
strange
turn
of
fate
had
not
brought
lord
fordyce
into
her
life
what
glorious
pleasure
she
would
now
take
in
trying
her
uttermost
to
fascinate
and
attract
michael
not
that
she
desired
him
for
herself
only
to
punish
him
for
all
the
past
but
she
was
not
free
she
had
given
her
word
to
henry
the
humiliation
of
feeling
that
michael
was
making
no
protest
and
would
apparently
from
this
fact
agree
willingly
to
divorce
her
stung
her
pride
and
made
her
want
to
make
him
suffer
and
regret
in
some
way
if
she
could
believe
that
it
was
paining
him
she
would
be
glad
and
if
it
appeared
possible
to
keep
up
the
pretence
of
unrecognition
for
longer
than
she
would
certainly
do
so
it
was
a
frantic
excitement
in
any
case
and
she
adored
difficult
games
then
as
she
put
the
letter
back
in
her
her
hand
touched
a
large
blue
enamel
locket
and
with
a
shiver
she
hastily
shut
down
the
lid
and
as
one
fleeing
from
a
ghost
she
ran
back
to
bed
michael
meanwhile
was
pacing
his
room
in
deep
and
agitated
thought
how
supremely
attractive
she
was
and
to
have
to
give
her
up
to
henry
it
was
too
frightfully
cruel
but
he
had
absolutely
no
right
to
stand
in
either
of
their
lights
he
had
not
even
the
right
to
undermine
his
friend
influence
by
deed
or
look
since
he
had
given
him
his
word
of
honor
that
he
would
not
do
so
what
a
blind
fool
he
had
been
all
those
years
ago
to
let
passionate
rage
at
sabine
daring
to
leave
him
make
him
write
her
that
letter
he
would
not
have
done
it
if
he
had
not
felt
such
an
intolerable
brute
and
glad
to
cut
the
whole
thing
by
accepting
latimer
berkeley
suggestion
to
join
him
for
the
china
expedition
at
once
the
berkeley
letter
coming
that
next
morning
was
a
stroke
of
fate
if
he
had
had
a
day
to
think
about
things
he
would
have
followed
his
impulse
after
the
anger
died
down
and
gone
after
her
to
london
address
but
he
had
already
wired
to
latimer
and
his
resentful
blood
was
up
he
remembered
how
he
had
not
allowed
himself
to
think
of
her
but
had
concentrated
his
whole
mind
upon
his
sport
for
it
had
been
tremendous
sport
and
had
interested
him
deeply
that
journey
to
tibet
and
however
strong
feelings
may
be
at
moments
absence
and
fresh
interests
dull
them
to
banish
her
memory
became
a
good
deal
easier
as
time
went
on
and
even
the
idea
to
divorce
her
if
she
wished
did
not
seem
too
hard
but
now
he
had
seen
her
again
and
every
spell
she
had
cast
over
him
on
that
june
night
was
renewed
she
was
everything
he
could
desire
she
was
beautiful
and
sweet
and
witty
with
a
charm
which
only
complete
independence
and
indifference
can
ever
give
a
woman
in
the
eyes
of
such
a
man
as
he
this
he
did
not
reason
out
thinking
himself
a
very
ordinary
person
in
fact
never
thinking
of
himself
at
all
or
what
his
temperament
was
affected
by
he
did
not
realize
either
that
the
very
fact
of
sabine
being
now
out
of
his
reach
made
her
appear
the
one
and
only
thing
he
cared
to
possess
he
knew
nothing
except
that
he
felt
perfectly
mad
with
fate
mad
with
himself
for
making
an
unconditional
promise
to
henry
perfectly
furious
that
he
had
been
too
stupid
to
connect
the
name
of
howard
at
once
with
his
wife
and
here
he
was
sleeping
in
her
castle
not
she
sleeping
in
his
and
he
was
conforming
to
her
lead
not
she
following
his
and
the
only
thing
for
a
gentleman
to
do
under
the
complicated
circumstances
was
to
speedily
divorce
her
according
to
the
scottish
law
and
let
her
marry
his
friend
henry
fordyce
give
them
his
blessing
and
lend
them
arranstoun
for
the
honeymoon
when
he
got
thus
far
in
his
meditations
he
simply
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
cursed
aloud
never
in
his
whole
life
had
bolts
or
bars
or
circumstances
been
allowed
to
keep
him
from
his
will
and
then
it
did
come
to
his
shrewd
mind
that
these
things
were
not
circumstances
but
were
barriers
forged
if
i
had
not
been
such
an
awful
brute
and
the
moment
had
not
been
as
it
was
i
might
have
gradually
made
her
love
me
and
kept
her
always
for
my
own
his
thoughts
ran
well
we
were
both
too
young
then
and
now
i
must
take
the
consequences
and
at
least
not
be
a
swine
to
poor
old
henry
with
superb
irony
among
his
letters
next
morning
which
he
had
wired
to
be
forwarded
to
héronac
there
came
one
from
his
lawyer
informing
him
that
he
had
received
a
guarded
communication
from
his
representative
parsons
with
what
practically
amounted
to
a
request
that
he
arranstoun
should
begin
to
set
the
law
in
motion
to
break
the
bond
between
them
and
his
lawyer
inquired
what
his
wishes
were
upon
the
subject
and
what
should
be
the
nature
of
their
reply
to
get
this
at
héronac
sabine
house
he
shook
with
fierce
laughter
in
his
bed
then
his
temper
got
up
and
he
came
to
a
fresh
determination
he
would
break
her
pride
she
should
kneel
if
she
wanted
her
freedom
she
should
have
it
only
if
she
asked
him
for
it
herself
he
would
not
leave
that
day
after
all
he
would
stay
and
play
the
comedy
to
its
end
while
she
would
not
recognize
him
he
would
not
recognize
her
it
was
she
who
had
set
the
pace
and
the
responsibility
of
not
informing
henry
lay
at
her
door
it
was
a
damnably
exciting
game
far
beyond
polo
or
even
slaying
tigers
in
manchuria
and
he
would
play
it
and
bluff
without
a
card
in
his
hand
he
was
not
a
noble
hero
you
see
but
just
a
strong
and
passionate
young
man
with
it
the
day
was
so
gorgeous
sabine
woke
with
some
kind
of
joyousness
she
was
only
years
old
and
supremely
healthy
and
however
complicated
fate
seemed
to
be
when
nerves
and
appetite
are
perfect
and
the
sun
is
shining
it
is
really
impossible
to
feel
too
gloomy
her
periwinkle
cambric
was
a
reflection
of
her
eyes
and
her
brown
hair
seemed
filled
with
rays
of
gold
as
she
stepped
across
the
courtyard
at
about
ten
on
her
way
to
the
garden
her
guests
would
sleep
late
and
at
breakfast
at
twelve
would
be
time
enough
to
see
them
but
michael
caught
sight
of
the
top
of
a
wide
straw
hat
and
the
flutter
of
a
bluish
gown
from
his
window
and
did
not
hesitate
for
a
second
henry
he
knew
was
only
in
his
bath
while
he
himself
was
fully
dressed
in
immaculate
white
flannels
it
did
not
take
him
five
minutes
to
gain
the
courtyard
or
to
saunter
over
the
causeway
bridge
and
into
the
garden
he
had
brought
the
english
papers
with
him
which
had
been
among
his
post
he
would
pretend
he
had
sought
solitude
and
would
be
duly
surprised
and
pleased
to
encounter
his
hostess
that
he
had
no
business
in
her
private
garden
at
all
without
her
invitation
did
not
trouble
him
things
like
that
never
blocked
his
way
he
had
always
been
too
welcome
anywhere
for
such
an
aspect
even
to
have
presented
itself
to
him
he
played
his
part
to
perfection
reconnoitering
as
stealthily
as
when
he
was
stalking
big
game
until
he
perceived
his
quarry
at
the
far
end
among
the
lavender
giving
orders
to
a
gardener
he
then
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
with
great
unconsciousness
to
read
the
paper
in
peace
apparently
being
his
only
care
here
he
paced
the
walk
which
cut
off
her
retreat
from
the
gate
never
glancing
up
sabine
saw
him
of
course
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
was
it
possible
for
a
man
to
be
so
or
so
utterly
casual
and
if
she
walked
toward
the
arbor
turret
he
would
be
obliged
to
see
her
when
she
came
to
the
end
and
then
must
come
up
and
say
she
picked
up
her
and
went
that
way
and
with
due
surprise
and
pleasure
michael
looked
up
from
his
paper
at
exactly
the
right
moment
and
caught
sight
of
her
he
came
toward
her
with
just
the
proper
amount
of
haste
and
raised
his
straw
hat
in
a
gay
is
it
a
divine
day
he
said
i
had
to
come
out
and
read
the
papers
and
the
courtyard
looked
so
dull
and
i
did
not
know
where
else
to
go
it
is
luck
finding
you
here
i
always
come
into
the
garden
in
the
morning
when
it
is
fine
i
know
every
plant
and
they
are
all
my
friends
then
to
hide
the
pleasurable
excitement
she
was
feeling
she
bent
down
and
picked
a
bit
of
lavender
i
love
that
smell
wo
you
give
me
some
too
he
pleaded
and
she
handed
him
a
sprig
which
he
fixed
in
his
white
coat
you
have
made
the
most
enchanting
place
of
this
he
next
told
her
ca
we
go
up
and
sit
in
that
while
you
tell
me
how
you
began
henry
said
all
this
was
a
ruin
when
you
bought
it
some
years
ago
it
is
extraordinarily
clever
of
you
not
the
slightest
embarrassment
was
in
his
manner
not
the
smallest
look
of
extra
meaning
in
his
eyes
he
was
simply
a
guest
and
she
a
hostess
out
together
in
the
sunlight
a
sense
of
unreality
stole
over
sabine
it
could
not
be
all
true
it
was
just
some
dream
a
little
more
vivid
that
was
all
than
those
which
used
to
come
to
her
of
him
sometimes
during
that
year
she
almost
felt
that
she
would
like
to
put
out
her
hand
and
touch
him
to
see
if
he
were
tangible
or
a
thing
of
illusion
as
she
led
the
way
to
the
turret
the
wall
which
protected
the
garden
from
the
sea
was
very
high
and
this
little
tower
had
been
in
the
original
fortifications
and
had
been
cleverly
adapted
to
its
present
use
it
was
open
with
glass
which
slid
back
on
the
southern
side
and
its
great
windows
looked
out
over
the
blue
waters
and
granite
rocks
on
the
other
the
little
bay
curved
round
so
that
from
there
you
got
a
view
of
the
château
sabine
put
her
basket
down
and
climbing
up
the
wooden
step
she
seated
herself
upon
the
high
her
feet
dangling
while
she
opened
the
casement
wide
michael
stood
beside
her
leaning
upon
the
sill
so
that
she
was
slightly
above
him
what
a
glorious
view
he
exclaimed
it
is
certainly
a
perfect
spot
why
it
has
everything
the
sea
and
its
waves
to
dash
up
at
it
and
then
this
lovely
garden
for
shelter
and
peace
what
a
fortunate
young
woman
you
are
yes
am
i
not
i
have
an
old
castle
too
perhaps
henry
has
told
you
about
it
we
have
owned
it
ever
since
adam
i
suppose
and
he
laughed
the
grim
part
of
this
is
rather
like
it
in
a
way
i
mean
the
stone
passages
and
huge
rooms
but
of
course
the
architecture
is
different
it
has
been
the
scene
of
every
sort
of
fight
i
should
like
to
show
it
to
you
some
day
stupefaction
rose
in
sabine
mind
after
all
had
she
been
mistaken
and
had
he
really
not
recognized
her
or
had
her
acting
of
the
night
before
convinced
him
that
his
first
ideas
must
be
wrong
and
that
she
was
really
not
his
wife
excitement
thrilled
her
but
if
he
was
playing
a
part
she
then
must
certainly
play
too
and
not
speak
to
him
about
the
divorce
until
he
spoke
to
her
thus
they
were
unconsciously
the
one
set
against
the
other
and
both
determined
that
the
other
should
show
first
hand
it
looked
as
though
the
interests
of
lord
fordyce
might
be
somehow
forgotten
they
talked
thus
for
half
an
hour
michael
asking
questions
about
héronac
with
polite
interest
and
without
ever
saying
a
sentence
with
a
double
meaning
and
she
replying
with
frank
information
and
both
burning
with
excitement
and
zest
then
her
great
charm
began
to
affect
him
so
profoundly
that
unconsciously
something
of
eagerness
and
emotion
crept
into
his
voice
it
was
one
of
those
voices
full
of
extraordinarily
attractive
cadences
at
any
time
and
made
for
the
seducing
of
a
ear
sabine
knew
that
she
was
enjoying
herself
with
a
wild
kind
of
forbidden
joy
but
she
did
not
analyze
its
cause
it
could
not
be
mean
to
henry
just
to
talk
about
héronac
when
she
was
not
by
word
or
look
deliberately
trying
to
fascinate
his
friend
she
was
only
being
naturally
polite
and
casual
arranstoun
only
wants
the
sea
michael
said
at
last
and
then
it
would
be
as
perfect
as
this
i
have
a
big
old
too
that
was
once
part
of
a
great
hall
and
my
bedroom
is
the
other
half
a
suite
all
to
myself
but
i
have
not
been
there
for
five
years
i
am
going
back
from
here
how
strange
to
be
away
from
your
home
for
so
long
sabine
remarked
innocently
where
have
you
been
then
he
told
her
all
about
china
and
tibet
i
had
taken
some
kind
of
distaste
for
arranstoun
and
shirked
going
there
i
shall
have
to
face
it
now
i
suppose
because
it
is
such
hard
luck
on
the
people
when
an
owner
is
away
and
so
one
must
come
up
to
the
scratch
yes
she
agreed
one
must
always
do
that
i
used
to
think
out
a
lot
of
things
when
i
was
in
the
wilds
and
i
grew
to
know
that
one
is
a
great
fool
when
young
and
a
great
brute
she
began
to
pull
her
lavender
to
pieces
this
conversation
was
growing
too
dangerously
fascinating
and
must
be
stopped
at
once
it
is
getting
nearly
she
said
gaily
and
i
just
want
to
pick
a
big
bunch
of
sweet
peas
before
the
sun
gets
on
them
wo
you
help
me
and
then
we
will
go
in
she
slid
to
the
floor
before
he
could
put
out
a
hand
to
assist
her
and
with
her
swift
graceful
movements
led
the
way
to
the
tall
sticks
where
the
last
of
the
summer
sweet
peas
grew
here
she
handed
him
the
basket
and
told
him
to
work
hard
and
all
the
while
she
chattered
of
the
ways
of
these
flowers
and
the
trouble
she
had
had
to
make
them
grow
there
and
would
not
once
let
the
conversation
upon
this
subject
flag
some
day
when
i
live
in
england
i
suppose
i
can
have
a
lovely
garden
there
it
is
famous
for
gardens
is
it
i
take
in
and
try
to
learn
from
it
yes
he
answered
and
grew
stiff
the
sudden
picture
of
her
living
in
england
with
henry
came
to
him
as
an
ugly
shock
before
you
settle
down
in
england
i
would
like
you
to
see
arranstoun
please
promise
me
to
come
and
stay
there
before
you
do
i
will
have
a
party
whenever
you
like
i
would
love
to
show
it
to
you
every
part
of
it
especially
the
chapel
it
is
full
of
wonderful
things
if
she
chose
to
give
him
reminders
of
aspects
which
hurt
he
would
do
the
same
it
sounds
most
interesting
she
agreed
but
had
not
the
courage
to
make
any
remarks
about
the
chapel
or
ask
what
it
contained
the
clock
over
the
gateway
struck
twelve
and
she
laughingly
started
to
walk
very
fast
toward
the
house
madame
imogen
and
lord
fordyce
will
be
ravenous
come
let
us
go
quickly
i
can
even
run
so
they
strode
on
together
with
the
radiant
faces
of
those
exalted
by
an
exciting
game
on
the
way
passing
père
anselme
and
in
the
cool
tapestried
antechamber
of
the
they
found
henry
looking
from
the
window
a
little
wistfully
and
a
pang
of
struck
both
their
hearts
chapter
xi
all
through
breakfast
sabine
devoted
herself
sedulously
to
lord
fordyce
and
this
produced
two
results
it
sent
henry
into
a
seventh
heaven
and
caused
michael
to
burn
with
jealous
rage
primitive
instincts
were
a
good
deal
taking
possession
of
him
and
he
found
it
extremely
difficult
to
keep
up
his
rôle
of
disinterested
friend
it
must
be
admitted
he
was
in
really
a
very
difficult
position
for
any
man
and
it
is
not
very
easy
to
decide
what
he
ought
to
have
done
short
of
telling
henry
the
truth
at
once
but
this
he
found
grew
every
moment
more
hard
to
do
it
would
mean
that
he
would
have
to
leave
héronac
immediately
in
any
case
he
must
do
this
directly
sabine
admitted
even
to
him
that
she
was
his
wife
they
could
not
together
agree
to
leave
henry
in
ignorance
that
would
be
deliberately
deceiving
and
would
make
them
both
feel
too
mean
but
while
nothing
was
even
tacitly
confessed
there
seemed
some
straw
for
his
honor
to
grasp
he
clutched
at
it
knowing
its
flimsy
nature
he
had
given
himself
until
the
next
day
and
now
refused
to
look
beyond
that
every
moment
sabine
was
attracting
him
more
deeply
and
bringing
certain
memories
more
vividly
before
him
with
maddening
tantalization
but
did
she
love
henry
of
that
he
could
not
be
sure
if
she
did
he
certainly
must
divorce
her
at
once
if
she
did
not
why
was
she
wishing
to
marry
him
henry
was
an
awfully
good
fellow
far
better
than
he
but
after
all
she
was
his
wife
even
though
he
had
forfeited
all
right
to
call
her
so
and
if
she
did
not
love
henry
no
friendship
toward
him
ought
to
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
their
reunion
it
is
astonishing
how
civilization
controls
nature
if
we
put
as
much
force
into
the
controlling
of
our
own
thoughts
as
we
put
into
acting
up
to
a
standard
of
public
behavior
what
wonderful
creatures
we
should
become
here
were
these
two
human
beings
young
and
strong
and
full
of
passion
playing
each
a
part
with
an
art
as
great
as
any
displayed
at
the
comédie
française
and
all
for
reasons
suggested
by
civilization
when
nature
would
have
solved
the
difficulty
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
michael
spent
a
breakfast
hour
in
purgatory
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
henry
expected
him
to
show
some
desire
to
go
fishing
or
to
want
some
other
sport
which
required
solitude
or
only
the
company
of
madame
imogen
and
his
afternoon
looked
as
if
it
were
not
going
to
be
a
thing
of
joy
the
result
of
civilization
then
made
him
say
may
i
take
out
that
boat
i
saw
in
the
little
harbor
after
breakfast
howard
i
must
have
some
real
exercise
two
days
in
a
motor
is
too
much
and
his
hostess
graciously
accorded
him
a
permission
while
her
heart
sank
at
least
she
experienced
that
unpleasant
physical
sensation
of
heaviness
somewhere
in
the
diaphragm
which
poets
have
christened
she
knew
it
was
quite
the
right
thing
for
him
to
have
done
and
yet
she
wished
fervently
that
they
could
have
spent
another
hour
like
the
one
in
the
turret
henry
was
radiant
and
as
michael
went
off
through
the
postern
and
down
to
the
little
harbor
where
the
boats
lay
he
asked
in
fine
language
what
were
his
beloved
wishes
for
the
afternoon
sabine
felt
pettish
she
wanted
to
snap
out
that
she
did
not
care
a
single
sou
what
they
did
but
she
controlled
herself
and
answered
sweetly
that
she
would
take
him
all
over
the
château
and
ask
his
opinion
and
advice
about
some
further
improvements
she
meant
to
make
they
strolled
first
to
the
crenellated
wall
of
the
courtyard
along
which
there
was
a
high
walk
from
which
you
looked
down
upon
the
and
the
little
jetty
this
wall
made
the
fourth
side
of
the
courtyard
and
with
the
gate
tower
and
the
concierge
tower
across
the
causeway
and
part
of
the
garden
elevation
was
the
very
oldest
of
the
whole
château
and
dated
from
early
feudal
times
they
leaned
upon
the
stone
and
looked
down
at
the
sea
there
are
only
a
very
few
days
in
the
year
that
ever
comes
out
of
her
shed
sabine
told
him
pointing
to
the
you
can
not
imagine
what
the
wind
is
here
even
now
it
may
get
up
in
a
few
moments
on
this
glassy
sea
or
thunder
may
come
and
in
the
autumn
the
storms
are
too
glorious
i
sit
at
one
of
the
big
windows
in
my
and
watch
the
waves
for
hours
they
break
on
the
rocks
which
stretch
out
from
the
tower
which
is
my
bedroom
on
the
finisterre
side
and
they
rise
it
is
a
most
splendid
sight
we
are
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
a
cauldron
of
boiling
foam
it
exalts
and
vitalizes
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
i
wish
it
had
been
the
autumn
now
i
do
he
said
i
much
prefer
the
summer
and
peace
i
want
to
take
away
all
that
desire
for
fierce
things
dearest
they
were
the
echoes
of
those
dark
thoughts
and
shadows
which
used
to
be
in
your
eyes
at
carlsbad
ah
if
you
could
she
sighed
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
seen
her
moved
and
it
distressed
him
do
you
not
think
that
i
can
then
he
asked
tenderly
it
is
the
only
thing
i
really
want
in
life
to
make
you
happy
how
good
you
are
henry
she
cried
so
noble
and
unselfish
and
true
you
frighten
me
i
am
just
a
creature
of
earth
full
of
things
you
may
not
like
when
you
know
me
better
i
am
sure
i
think
of
myself
more
than
any
one
else
you
make
me
ashamed
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
while
his
fine
gray
eyes
melted
in
worship
i
will
not
even
listen
when
you
say
such
things
for
me
you
are
perfect
a
pearl
of
great
price
i
must
try
to
be
but
i
am
not
and
her
voice
trembled
a
little
i
believe
i
am
as
full
of
faults
and
life
as
your
friend
there
arranstoun
who
i
am
sure
is
just
a
selfish
reckless
man
michael
at
this
moment
reached
the
with
old
berthe
son
who
began
to
help
him
to
untie
the
one
he
wanted
he
looked
the
most
splendid
creature
there
in
his
white
flannels
and
he
turned
and
waved
to
them
and
then
got
in
and
pulled
out
a
few
yards
with
long
easy
strokes
michael
is
a
character
his
friend
said
he
has
been
spoilt
all
his
life
by
women
and
fortune
he
has
a
most
strange
story
he
married
a
girl
about
five
years
ago
just
to
make
himself
safe
from
another
woman
whom
he
had
been
making
love
to
i
was
awfully
angry
with
him
at
the
time
i
was
staying
in
the
house
and
i
refused
to
wait
for
the
wedding
i
thought
it
such
a
shame
to
the
girl
although
it
was
merely
an
empty
ceremony
but
she
was
awfully
young
i
believe
how
interesting
and
sabine
voice
was
strained
you
saw
the
girl
what
was
she
like
no
i
never
saw
her
it
was
all
settled
one
afternoon
when
i
was
out
and
i
thought
it
such
a
thundering
shame
that
i
left
that
same
night
and
if
you
had
stayed
you
would
have
met
her
how
curious
fate
is
sometimes
is
it
perhaps
you
could
have
prevented
your
friend
being
so
foolish
if
you
had
stayed
no
nothing
in
the
world
would
ever
prevent
michael
from
doing
what
he
wanted
to
it
is
in
the
blood
of
all
those
old
border
families
heredity
again
they
flourished
by
imposing
their
wills
recklessly
and
snatching
and
fighting
and
who
ever
survived
was
a
strong
man
it
has
come
down
to
them
in
force
and
vigor
and
daring
unto
this
day
but
what
happened
about
the
marriage
sabine
asked
it
interests
me
so
much
it
sounds
so
romantic
at
this
time
nothing
happened
except
that
they
went
through
the
ceremony
and
the
girl
left
at
once
that
same
night
i
believe
and
michael
has
never
seen
or
heard
of
her
since
he
tells
me
the
time
is
up
now
when
he
can
divorce
her
for
desertion
according
to
scotch
law
and
i
fancy
he
will
it
is
a
ridiculous
position
for
them
both
he
does
not
even
know
if
she
has
not
preferred
some
one
else
by
now
surely
she
would
have
given
some
sign
if
she
had
but
perhaps
he
does
not
care
not
much
i
fancy
he
amused
himself
a
good
deal
at
ostende
and
henry
smiled
he
has
been
away
in
the
wilds
for
five
years
and
naturally
has
come
back
full
of
zest
for
civilization
sabine
full
lips
curled
and
she
looked
at
the
sea
again
and
the
figure
in
the
boat
rapidly
pulling
away
from
the
shore
if
he
chose
to
leave
her
alone
all
these
years
he
could
not
expect
anything
else
could
he
than
that
she
would
have
grown
to
care
for
another
man
no
that
is
what
i
told
him
and
he
said
he
was
a
dog
in
the
manger
he
did
not
want
her
himself
and
yet
did
not
wish
to
give
her
to
any
one
else
how
disgustingly
selfish
men
are
proverbially
selfish
and
henry
smiled
again
it
is
the
nature
of
the
creatures
the
violet
eyes
were
glowing
as
stars
might
glow
could
they
be
angry
and
their
owner
turned
away
from
the
sea
with
a
fine
shrug
of
her
shoulders
her
thoughts
were
raging
so
that
is
how
michael
looked
upon
the
he
was
just
the
dog
in
the
manger
and
she
was
the
hay
but
never
never
would
she
submit
to
that
she
would
speak
to
him
when
he
came
in
and
ask
him
to
divorce
her
at
once
why
should
henry
ever
know
even
if
scotch
divorces
were
reported
she
would
appear
not
as
howard
but
as
arranstoun
then
a
discouraging
thought
came
only
sabine
was
such
an
uncommon
name
if
it
were
not
for
that
he
might
never
guess
but
whether
henry
ever
knew
or
did
not
know
the
sooner
she
were
free
the
better
and
then
she
would
marry
him
and
adorn
his
great
position
in
the
world
and
michael
would
see
her
there
and
how
well
she
fulfilled
her
duties
so
even
yet
she
would
be
able
to
punish
him
as
he
deserved
hay
indeed
never
never
never
then
she
knew
she
must
have
been
answering
at
random
some
of
lord
fordyce
remarks
for
a
rather
puzzled
look
was
on
his
face
a
strong
revulsion
of
feeling
came
to
her
henry
suddenly
appeared
in
his
best
guise
and
a
wave
of
tenderness
for
him
swept
over
her
how
kind
and
courteous
and
devoted
he
was
treating
her
always
as
his
queen
she
could
be
sure
of
homage
here
and
that
far
from
being
hay
she
would
be
the
most
valued
jewel
in
his
crown
of
success
she
would
rise
into
spheres
where
she
would
be
above
the
paltry
emotions
caused
by
a
hateful
man
just
because
he
had
it
so
she
gave
her
hand
to
henry
in
a
burst
of
exuberance
and
let
him
place
it
in
his
arm
and
then
lead
her
back
into
the
château
and
through
all
the
rooms
where
they
discussed
blues
and
greens
and
stuffs
and
furniture
and
the
lowering
of
this
doorway
and
the
heightening
of
that
and
at
last
they
drifted
to
the
garden
and
to
the
lavender
hedge
but
she
would
not
take
him
into
the
or
again
look
out
on
the
sea
all
through
her
sweetness
there
was
a
note
of
unrest
and
henry
fine
senses
told
him
so
and
this
left
the
one
drop
of
bitterness
in
his
otherwise
blissful
cup
michael
meanwhile
was
expending
his
energy
and
his
passion
in
swift
movement
in
the
boat
but
after
a
while
he
rested
on
his
oars
and
then
he
began
to
think
there
was
no
use
in
going
on
with
the
game
after
all
he
ought
to
go
away
at
once
if
he
stayed
and
saw
her
any
more
he
would
not
be
able
to
leave
her
at
all
he
knew
he
would
only
break
his
promise
to
henry
tell
sabine
that
he
had
fallen
madly
in
love
with
her
implore
her
again
to
forgive
him
for
everything
in
the
past
and
let
them
begin
afresh
but
he
was
faced
with
the
horrible
thought
of
the
anguish
to
henry
henry
his
old
friend
who
trusted
him
and
who
was
ten
times
more
worthy
of
this
dear
woman
than
he
was
himself
he
had
never
been
so
full
of
impotency
and
misery
in
his
life
not
even
on
that
morning
in
june
when
he
woke
and
found
sabine
had
left
him
defied
him
and
gone
after
everything
pure
rage
had
come
to
his
aid
then
but
now
he
had
only
remorse
and
longing
and
anger
with
fate
it
must
all
depend
upon
whether
or
no
she
loves
henry
he
said
to
himself
at
last
and
this
i
will
make
her
tell
me
this
very
afternoon
but
when
he
got
back
and
went
into
the
garden
he
happened
to
witness
a
scene
sabine
overcome
by
lord
fordyce
goodness
had
let
him
hold
her
arm
while
her
head
was
perilously
near
to
his
shoulder
it
all
looked
very
intimate
and
when
seen
from
afar
the
greatest
pain
michael
arranstoun
had
ever
experienced
came
into
his
heart
and
without
waiting
a
second
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
back
to
the
house
here
he
had
a
bath
and
changed
his
clothes
while
his
servant
packed
and
then
with
the
help
of
madame
imogen
he
looked
up
a
train
yes
there
was
a
fast
one
which
went
to
paris
from
their
nearest
little
town
he
could
just
catch
it
by
ordering
henry
motor
this
he
promptly
did
and
leaving
the
best
excuses
he
could
invent
with
madame
imogen
he
got
in
and
departed
a
few
minutes
before
his
hostess
and
lord
fordyce
came
back
to
tea
at
five
he
had
written
a
short
note
to
sabine
which
nicholas
handed
to
her
she
opened
it
with
trembling
fingers
this
was
all
it
was
i
understand
and
i
will
get
the
divorce
as
soon
as
the
law
will
allow
and
i
will
try
to
arrange
that
henry
need
never
know
i
would
like
you
just
to
have
come
to
arranstoun
once
more
perhaps
i
can
persuade
henry
to
bring
you
there
in
the
autumn
michael
arranstoun
it
was
as
well
that
lord
fordyce
had
gone
up
to
his
room
for
the
lady
of
héronac
grew
white
as
death
for
a
moment
and
then
crumpling
the
note
in
her
hand
she
staggered
up
the
old
stone
stairs
to
her
great
so
he
had
gone
then
and
they
could
have
no
explanation
but
he
had
come
out
of
the
manger
and
was
going
to
let
the
other
animal
eat
the
hay
this
however
was
very
poor
comfort
and
brought
no
consolation
on
its
wings
civilization
again
won
the
game
for
she
had
to
listen
unconcernedly
to
madame
imogen
voluble
description
of
michael
leaving
pressing
business
which
he
had
mistaken
the
date
about
finally
she
had
to
pour
out
tea
and
smile
happily
at
henry
and
père
anselme
but
when
she
was
at
last
alone
she
flung
herself
down
by
the
window
seat
and
shook
all
over
with
sobs
michael
note
to
henry
was
characteristic
i
bored
my
dear
henry
the
picture
of
your
bliss
is
not
inspiriting
so
i
am
off
to
paris
and
thence
home
i
hope
think
i
behaved
all
right
and
played
the
game
took
your
motor
to
catch
train
chapter
xii
the
père
anselme
was
uneasy
very
little
escaped
his
observation
and
he
saw
at
tea
that
his
much
loved
dame
was
not
herself
she
had
not
been
herself
the
night
before
at
dinner
either
there
was
more
in
the
coming
of
these
two
englishmen
than
met
the
eye
he
had
seen
her
with
michael
in
the
morning
in
the
from
a
corner
of
the
garden
too
where
he
was
having
a
heated
argument
with
the
gardener
in
chief
as
well
as
when
he
met
them
on
the
causeway
bridge
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
do
something
to
smooth
matters
but
what
he
could
not
decide
perhaps
she
would
tell
him
about
it
on
the
morrow
when
he
met
her
as
was
his
custom
on
days
that
were
not
saints
days
interfered
with
by
mass
i
shall
be
at
the
gate
at
nine
he
said
when
he
wished
her
with
your
permission
we
must
decide
about
the
clematis
trellis
for
the
north
wall
without
delay
henry
accompanied
the
old
man
on
his
walk
back
to
the
village
and
they
conversed
in
cultivated
and
stilted
french
of
philosophy
and
of
breton
and
of
the
strange
melancholy
type
they
seemed
to
have
they
look
ever
out
to
sea
the
priest
said
they
are
watching
the
deep
waters
and
are
conscious
forever
of
their
own
and
loved
dangers
they
are
braves
it
seems
so
wonderful
that
anything
so
young
and
full
of
life
as
howard
should
have
been
drawn
to
live
in
such
an
isolated
place
does
it
not
henry
asked
it
seems
incongruous
when
she
came
first
she
was
very
sad
she
had
cause
for
much
sorrow
the
dear
child
and
the
sea
was
her
mate
together
she
and
i
with
the
sea
have
studied
many
things
she
deserves
happiness
monsieur
her
soul
is
as
pure
and
as
generous
as
an
angel
if
monsieur
knew
what
she
does
for
my
poor
people
and
for
all
who
come
under
her
care
it
will
be
the
endeavor
of
my
life
to
make
her
happy
father
and
lord
fordyce
voice
was
full
of
feeling
happiness
can
only
be
secured
in
two
ways
my
son
either
it
comes
in
the
guise
of
peace
after
the
flames
have
burnt
themselves
out
or
it
comes
through
fusion
of
love
at
fever
heat
yes
henry
faltered
rather
anxiously
when
there
are
still
some
cinders
alight
the
peaceful
happiness
is
not
quite
certain
of
fulfilment
it
becomes
an
experiment
then
with
some
risks
what
makes
you
say
this
to
me
the
old
priest
did
not
look
at
him
but
continued
to
gaze
ahead
i
have
the
welfare
of
our
dame
very
strongly
at
heart
monsieur
as
you
can
guess
and
i
am
not
altogether
sure
that
the
cinders
are
not
still
red
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
ascertain
whether
this
be
so
or
not
before
you
ask
her
to
make
fresh
bonds
you
think
she
still
cares
for
her
husband
then
henry
was
very
pale
i
do
not
know
that
she
ever
cared
but
i
do
know
that
even
his
memory
has
power
to
disturb
her
he
must
have
been
just
such
another
as
your
friend
the
seigneur
of
arranstoun
it
is
his
presence
which
has
reminded
her
of
something
of
the
past
since
it
can
not
be
he
himself
no
of
course
it
can
not
be
michael
and
henry
laughed
shortly
he
is
an
englishman
she
had
never
seen
him
before
yesterday
you
think
she
seems
disturbed
yes
what
would
you
have
me
do
then
father
i
love
this
woman
more
than
my
life
and
only
desire
her
happiness
the
curé
of
héronac
shrugged
his
high
shoulders
slightly
it
is
not
for
me
to
give
advice
to
a
man
of
the
world
but
had
it
been
in
the
days
when
i
was
gaston
of
the
imperial
guard
i
should
have
told
you
use
your
intelligence
search
investigate
for
yourself
make
her
love
you
leave
nothing
vague
or
to
chance
as
a
priest
i
must
say
that
i
find
all
divorces
wrong
and
that
for
me
she
should
remain
the
wife
of
the
other
man
even
when
the
man
is
a
drunkard
or
a
lunatic
and
there
have
been
no
children
henry
demanded
a
strange
look
came
in
the
old
curé
eye
as
he
glanced
at
his
companion
covertly
and
for
a
second
it
seemed
as
though
he
meant
to
speak
his
thought
but
the
only
words
which
came
were
in
latin
those
whom
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
and
then
he
held
out
his
thin
brown
hand
they
had
reached
his
door
in
all
cases
you
have
my
good
wishes
my
son
for
you
seem
worthy
of
her
my
good
wishes
and
my
prayers
lord
fordyce
mounted
the
stairs
to
his
lady
with
lagging
steps
the
père
anselme
advice
had
caused
him
to
think
deeply
and
it
was
necessary
that
he
had
speech
with
sabine
if
she
would
let
him
come
back
into
her
he
knocked
at
the
door
softly
as
was
his
way
and
when
her
voice
said
rather
impatiently
he
did
enter
and
advance
with
diffidence
she
was
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
light
in
one
of
the
great
window
embrasures
so
that
he
could
not
see
the
expression
upon
her
face
and
her
tone
became
gentle
as
she
welcomed
him
the
evening
is
so
glorious
come
and
watch
the
sunset
but
there
is
a
little
look
of
thunder
there
in
the
far
west
we
may
have
a
storm
henry
sat
down
beside
her
on
the
orange
velvet
seat
and
his
eyes
full
of
love
and
tenderness
sought
her
face
beseechingly
i
shall
simply
hate
going
the
day
after
dearest
he
said
if
it
were
not
for
the
sternest
duty
to
my
mother
i
would
ask
you
to
keep
me
until
friday
it
will
be
such
pain
to
tear
myself
away
you
have
been
dear
she
answered
very
low
you
have
shown
me
what
real
love
in
a
man
means
what
tenderness
and
courtesy
can
make
of
life
henry
however
wayward
i
may
be
you
will
bear
with
me
will
you
not
i
want
to
be
good
and
happy
her
sweet
voice
with
its
faintly
french
accent
was
full
of
pathos
as
a
child
might
be
who
is
asking
for
comfort
and
sympathy
for
some
threatened
hurt
oh
i
want
to
be
in
the
sure
shelter
of
your
love
always
so
that
storms
like
that
one
coming
up
over
there
can
not
touch
me
i
want
you
to
make
me
forget
everything
he
was
so
deeply
moved
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
as
he
bent
and
kissed
her
hands
with
reverence
my
darling
you
shall
indeed
be
worshipped
and
protected
and
kept
from
all
clouds
only
first
tell
me
sabine
straight
from
your
heart
do
you
really
and
truly
desire
to
marry
me
i
do
not
ask
you
to
tell
me
that
you
love
me
yet
because
i
know
that
you
do
not
but
i
want
to
know
the
truth
if
you
have
a
single
doubt
whether
it
is
for
your
happiness
tell
it
to
me
let
there
be
no
uncertainties
between
us
my
dear
love
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
while
his
tenderness
seemed
to
be
pouring
balm
upon
her
troubled
spirit
my
god
he
cried
fearing
her
silence
sabine
speak
to
me
i
will
not
hold
you
for
a
second
if
you
would
rather
be
free
if
you
think
i
can
not
chase
all
sad
memories
away
she
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
his
arm
if
you
will
be
content
to
take
me
knowing
that
i
have
things
to
forget
and
if
you
will
help
me
to
forget
them
then
i
know
that
i
want
to
marry
you
henry
just
as
perhaps
that
little
sail
we
see
out
there
will
long
to
get
in
to
a
safe
port
he
gave
her
his
promise
with
passionately
loving
words
that
he
would
protect
and
adore
her
always
and
soothe
and
cherish
her
until
all
haunting
memories
were
gone
and
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
known
one
another
sabine
let
him
fold
her
in
his
arms
but
the
lips
which
he
pressed
so
fondly
were
cold
like
death
and
afterwards
she
went
quickly
to
her
room
the
die
was
irrevocably
cast
she
could
never
go
back
now
she
was
as
firmly
bound
to
henry
as
if
she
had
been
already
his
wife
for
her
nature
was
tender
and
honest
and
true
and
lord
fordyce
had
touched
the
highest
chord
in
it
the
chord
of
her
soul
but
as
she
stood
looking
from
the
narrow
deep
casement
up
at
the
evening
sky
suddenly
with
terrible
vividness
there
came
back
to
her
mental
vision
the
chapel
at
arranstoun
upon
her
wedding
night
with
its
gorgeous
splendors
and
the
candles
and
the
lilies
and
their
strong
scent
and
it
was
as
if
she
could
feel
michael
kiss
when
the
old
clergyman
words
were
done
she
started
forward
with
a
little
moan
and
put
her
hands
over
her
eyes
then
her
will
reasserted
itself
and
her
firm
lips
closed
tight
nothing
should
make
her
waver
or
alter
her
mind
now
and
these
phantasies
should
be
ruthlessly
stamped
out
she
sat
down
in
an
armchair
and
forced
herself
to
picture
her
life
with
henry
it
would
be
full
of
such
great
and
interesting
things
and
he
would
be
there
to
guide
and
protect
her
always
and
keep
her
from
all
regrets
so
presently
she
grew
calm
and
comforted
and
by
the
time
she
was
dressed
for
dinner
she
was
even
bright
and
gay
and
made
a
most
sweet
and
gracious
mistress
of
héronac
and
of
the
heart
of
henry
fordyce
just
as
they
were
leaving
the
nicholas
brought
her
a
message
from
père
anselme
to
the
effect
that
a
very
bad
storm
was
coming
up
and
she
must
be
sure
to
have
the
great
iron
shutters
inside
the
lower
dungeon
windows
securely
closed
he
had
already
told
son
to
take
in
the
little
boat
and
as
they
crossed
the
connecting
passage
madame
imogen
gave
a
scream
for
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
came
in
through
the
open
windows
followed
by
a
terrific
crash
of
thunder
and
when
they
reached
the
the
storm
had
indeed
come
it
was
past
midnight
when
michael
reached
paris
and
going
in
to
the
ritz
met
miss
daisy
van
der
horn
and
a
number
of
other
friends
just
leaving
after
a
merry
dinner
in
a
private
room
they
greeted
him
with
fervor
where
had
he
been
and
would
not
he
dress
quickly
and
come
on
to
supper
with
them
why
you
look
as
glum
as
an
owl
michael
arranstoun
miss
van
der
horn
herself
informed
him
just
you
hustle
and
put
on
your
evening
things
and
we
make
you
feel
a
new
man
and
with
the
most
supreme
insolence
before
them
all
he
bent
down
and
kissed
both
her
hands
while
his
blue
eyes
blazed
with
devilment
as
he
answered
i
will
join
you
in
half
an
hour
but
if
you
pull
me
out
of
bed
like
this
you
will
have
to
make
a
night
of
it
with
me
you
sha
go
home
at
all
chapter
xiii
a
whole
month
went
by
and
after
the
storm
peace
seemed
to
cover
héronac
sabine
gardened
with
père
anselme
and
listened
to
his
kindly
shrewd
common
sense
and
then
they
read
poetry
in
the
afternoons
when
tea
was
over
they
read
béranger
françois
villon
victor
hugo
and
every
now
and
then
they
even
dashed
into
de
musset
the
good
father
felt
more
easy
in
his
mind
after
all
his
impressions
of
lord
fordyce
character
had
been
very
high
and
he
was
not
apt
to
make
mistakes
in
people
perhaps
le
bon
dieu
meant
to
make
an
exception
in
favor
of
the
beloved
dame
and
to
find
divorce
a
good
thing
sabine
had
heard
from
parsons
that
the
negotiations
had
commenced
it
would
be
some
time
though
before
she
could
be
free
she
must
formally
refuse
to
return
when
the
demand
asking
her
to
do
so
should
come
this
she
was
prepared
to
carry
out
she
firmly
and
determinedly
banished
all
thought
of
michael
from
her
mind
and
hardly
ever
went
into
the
garden
because
when
she
did
she
saw
him
too
plainly
standing
there
in
his
white
flannels
with
the
sprig
of
her
lavender
in
his
coat
and
his
bold
blue
eyes
looking
up
at
her
with
their
horribly
powerful
charm
the
force
of
will
can
do
such
wonders
that
as
the
days
went
on
the
pain
and
unrest
of
her
hours
lessened
in
a
great
degree
every
morning
there
came
an
adoring
letter
from
henry
in
which
he
never
said
too
much
or
too
little
but
everything
that
could
excite
her
cultivated
intelligence
and
refresh
her
soul
in
all
the
after
years
of
her
life
whatever
might
befall
her
these
letters
of
henry
would
have
a
lasting
influence
upon
her
they
polished
and
moulded
her
taste
and
put
her
on
her
mettle
to
answer
them
and
gradually
they
grew
to
be
an
absorbing
interest
he
selected
the
books
she
was
to
read
and
sent
her
boxes
of
them
it
had
been
agreed
before
he
left
that
he
would
not
return
to
héronac
for
some
time
but
that
in
late
october
when
the
princess
and
cloudwater
got
back
to
paris
that
if
they
could
be
persuaded
to
come
to
london
sabine
would
accompany
them
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
henry
mother
and
some
of
his
family
who
would
be
in
ignorance
of
there
being
any
tie
between
them
and
the
whole
thing
could
be
done
casually
and
with
good
sense
i
want
my
mother
and
my
sisters
to
love
you
darling
henry
wrote
without
a
prejudiced
eye
my
mother
would
find
you
perfect
whatever
you
were
like
if
she
knew
that
you
were
my
choice
and
for
the
same
reason
my
sisters
would
perhaps
find
fault
with
you
so
i
want
you
to
make
their
conquest
without
any
handicap
sabine
writing
one
of
her
long
letters
to
moravia
in
italy
said
i
am
very
happy
morri
this
calm
englishman
is
teaching
me
such
a
number
of
new
aspects
of
life
and
making
me
more
determined
than
ever
to
be
a
very
great
lady
in
the
future
we
are
so
clever
in
our
nation
and
all
the
young
vitality
in
us
is
so
splendid
when
it
is
directed
and
does
not
turn
to
nerves
and
fads
i
am
growing
so
much
my
dear
under
his
guidance
you
will
know
me
when
we
meet
because
each
day
i
grow
more
to
understand
the
père
anselme
had
only
one
moment
of
doubt
again
just
the
last
morning
before
his
dame
left
for
paris
when
october
had
come
it
was
raining
hard
and
he
found
her
in
the
great
with
a
document
in
her
hand
her
face
was
very
pale
and
lying
on
the
beside
her
was
an
envelope
directed
and
stamped
it
contained
her
refusal
to
return
to
her
husband
signed
and
sealed
the
old
priest
did
not
ask
her
any
questions
he
guessed
and
sympathized
but
his
lady
was
too
restless
to
begin
their
reading
and
stole
from
window
to
window
looking
out
on
the
gray
sea
i
shall
come
here
for
six
months
in
the
year
just
as
always
father
she
said
at
last
i
can
never
sever
myself
from
héronac
god
forbid
exclaimed
the
priest
aghast
if
you
left
us
the
sun
no
more
would
seem
to
shine
and
sometimes
i
will
come
alone
because
there
will
be
times
my
father
when
i
shall
want
to
fight
things
out
alone
the
père
anselme
took
some
steps
nearer
her
and
after
a
moment
said
in
a
grave
voice
remember
always
my
daughter
that
le
bon
dieu
settles
things
for
us
mortals
if
we
leave
it
all
to
him
but
if
we
take
the
helm
in
the
direction
of
our
own
affairs
it
may
be
he
will
let
circumstance
draw
us
into
rough
waters
in
that
case
the
only
thing
for
us
is
to
be
true
to
our
word
and
to
our
own
souls
and
to
use
common
sense
sabine
looked
at
him
with
somber
startled
eyes
you
mean
that
i
decided
to
help
myself
father
about
the
divorce
and
that
now
i
must
look
only
to
myself
it
is
a
terrible
thought
you
are
strong
my
child
it
may
be
that
you
were
directed
from
above
i
can
not
say
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
gently
only
that
the
good
god
is
always
merciful
what
you
must
be
is
true
to
yourself
and
he
placed
his
hand
upon
her
head
but
for
once
sabine
lost
control
of
her
emotions
and
bursting
into
a
passion
of
tears
she
rushed
from
the
room
alas
all
is
well
said
the
priest
half
aloud
and
then
he
knelt
by
the
window
and
prayed
fervently
without
telling
his
beads
but
at
breakfast
sabine
eyes
were
dry
again
and
she
seemed
quite
calm
she
too
had
held
communion
with
herself
and
her
will
had
once
more
resumed
the
mastery
this
should
be
the
last
exhibition
of
weakness
and
the
last
feeling
of
weakness
and
as
she
would
suppress
the
outward
signs
so
she
would
crush
the
inner
emotion
all
life
looked
smiling
she
was
young
healthy
and
rich
she
had
inspired
the
devoted
love
of
a
good
and
great
man
whose
position
would
give
scope
for
her
ambitions
whose
intellect
was
a
source
of
pleasure
and
joy
to
her
and
whose
tenderness
would
smooth
all
her
path
what
right
had
she
to
have
even
a
crumpled
rose
leaf
none
in
the
world
she
must
get
accustomed
even
to
hearing
of
michael
and
perhaps
to
meeting
him
again
face
to
face
since
henry
was
never
to
know
or
at
least
not
for
years
perhaps
when
she
had
been
so
long
happily
married
that
the
knowledge
would
create
no
jar
and
at
all
events
he
need
not
know
of
the
afterwards
that
should
remain
forever
locked
in
her
heart
then
she
resolutely
turned
to
lighter
thoughts
her
clothes
in
paris
the
pleasure
to
see
moravia
again
the
excitement
of
her
trip
to
london
where
she
had
never
been
except
to
pass
through
that
once
long
ago
the
père
anselme
came
to
the
station
with
her
and
as
he
closed
the
door
of
the
reserved
carriage
she
was
in
he
said
blessings
be
upon
your
head
my
child
and
whatever
comes
may
the
good
god
direct
you
into
peace
then
he
turned
upon
his
heel
his
black
eyes
dim
for
the
autumn
months
would
be
long
with
only
madame
imogen
for
companion
beside
his
flock
and
the
sea
michael
had
got
back
from
paris
utterly
disgusted
with
life
sick
with
himself
bitterly
resentful
against
fate
for
creating
such
a
tangled
skein
and
dangling
happiness
in
front
of
him
only
to
snatch
it
away
again
he
went
up
to
arranstoun
and
tried
to
play
his
part
in
the
rejoicings
at
his
return
he
opened
the
house
engaged
a
full
staff
of
servants
and
filled
it
with
guests
he
shot
with
frantic
eagerness
for
one
week
and
then
with
indifference
the
next
whatever
he
may
have
done
wrong
in
his
life
his
punishment
had
come
he
had
naturally
an
iron
will
and
when
he
began
to
use
it
to
calm
his
emotions
a
better
state
of
things
might
set
in
but
for
the
time
being
he
was
just
drifting
and
sorrow
was
his
friend
his
suite
at
arranstoun
which
he
had
never
seen
since
the
day
after
his
wedding
having
gone
up
to
london
that
very
next
night
and
from
there
made
all
his
arrangements
for
the
china
trip
gave
him
a
shock
he
who
had
nerves
of
steel
and
into
the
chapel
he
loathed
to
go
his
one
consolation
was
that
binko
now
seven
years
old
had
not
transferred
his
affection
to
alexander
armstrong
with
whom
he
had
spent
the
time
but
after
an
hour
or
two
had
rapturously
appeared
to
remember
his
master
and
now
never
if
he
could
help
it
left
his
side
michael
took
to
reading
books
no
habit
of
his
youth
although
his
shrewd
mind
had
not
left
him
in
the
usual
plight
of
blank
ignorance
which
is
often
the
portion
of
a
splendid
young
athlete
leaving
eton
but
now
he
studied
subjects
seriously
and
the
whys
and
wherefores
of
things
and
he
grew
rather
to
enjoy
the
evenings
alone
between
the
goings
and
comings
of
his
parties
when
buried
in
a
huge
chair
before
his
log
fire
with
only
binko
snorts
for
company
he
could
pore
over
some
volume
of
interest
he
studied
his
family
records
too
getting
all
sorts
of
interesting
documents
out
of
his
muniment
room
what
a
fierce
brutal
lot
they
had
always
been
no
wonder
the
chapel
had
to
be
so
gloriously
filled
and
then
there
came
to
his
memory
the
one
little
window
which
was
still
plain
and
how
he
had
told
sabine
that
he
supposed
it
had
been
left
for
him
to
garnish
as
an
expiatory
offering
the
race
being
so
full
of
rapine
and
sin
should
he
put
the
gorgeous
glass
in
now
it
was
time
but
a
glass
window
could
not
prevent
the
punishment
since
it
had
already
fallen
upon
him
nor
even
alleviate
the
suffering
he
was
staring
straight
in
front
of
him
at
the
picture
of
mary
queen
of
scots
landing
it
had
been
painted
at
about
when
romantic
subjects
of
that
sort
were
in
vogue
and
the
fellow
in
the
blue
doublet
was
said
by
the
artist
to
represent
the
celebrated
arranstoun
of
that
time
the
one
who
had
killed
a
moreton
and
stolen
his
wife
no
doubt
that
is
why
his
grandfather
had
bought
it
he
thought
it
looked
very
well
over
the
secret
door
and
then
he
deliberately
let
himself
picture
how
it
had
once
fallen
forward
and
all
the
circumstances
which
had
followed
in
consequence
he
reconstructed
every
word
he
could
remember
of
his
and
sabine
conversation
that
afternoon
he
repictured
her
innocent
baby
face
and
from
there
on
to
the
night
of
the
wedding
he
reviewed
all
his
emotions
in
the
chapel
and
the
strange
exaltation
which
was
upon
him
then
and
the
mad
fire
which
awoke
in
his
blood
with
his
first
kiss
or
of
her
fresh
young
lips
when
the
vows
were
said
every
minute
incident
was
burned
into
his
memory
until
the
cutting
of
the
cake
after
that
it
seemed
to
be
a
chaos
of
wild
passion
and
moments
of
extraordinary
bliss
he
suddenly
could
almost
see
her
little
head
there
unresisting
on
his
breast
all
tears
and
terror
at
last
hushed
to
rest
by
his
fond
caresses
and
then
he
started
from
his
seat
the
memory
was
too
terribly
sweet
he
had
of
course
been
the
most
frightful
brute
nothing
could
alter
or
redeem
that
fact
but
when
sleep
came
to
them
at
length
he
had
believed
that
he
had
made
her
forgive
him
and
that
he
could
teach
her
to
love
him
and
have
no
regrets
then
the
agony
to
wake
and
find
her
gone
what
made
her
go
after
all
how
had
she
slipped
from
his
arms
without
awakening
him
if
he
had
only
heard
her
when
she
was
stealing
from
the
room
he
could
have
reasoned
with
her
and
even
have
again
caught
her
and
kissed
her
into
obedience
but
he
had
slept
on
he
remembered
all
his
emotions
rage
at
her
daring
to
cross
his
will
to
begin
with
and
then
the
deep
wound
to
his
that
is
what
had
made
him
write
the
hard
letter
which
forever
put
an
end
to
their
reunion
what
a
paltry
miserable
arrogant
wretch
i
was
then
he
thought
and
how
pitifully
uncontrolled
but
all
was
now
too
late
the
next
morning
post
brought
him
a
letter
from
henry
fordyce
in
which
he
told
him
he
had
been
meaning
to
write
to
him
ever
since
he
had
returned
from
france
more
than
a
month
ago
but
had
been
too
occupied
the
whole
epistle
breathed
ecstatic
happiness
he
was
utterly
absorbed
in
his
lady
love
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
and
since
his
mind
seemed
so
peaceful
and
joyous
it
was
evident
she
must
reciprocate
well
henry
was
worthy
of
her
but
this
in
no
way
healed
the
hurt
michael
violently
tore
up
the
letter
and
bounded
from
his
bed
passion
boiling
in
him
again
he
wanted
to
slay
something
he
almost
wished
his
friend
had
been
an
enemy
that
he
could
have
gone
out
and
fought
with
him
and
reseized
his
bride
what
matter
that
she
should
be
unwilling
the
arranstoun
brides
had
often
been
unwilling
she
had
been
unwilling
before
and
he
had
crushed
her
resistance
and
even
made
her
eventually
show
him
some
acquiescence
and
content
he
could
certainly
do
it
again
and
with
more
chance
of
success
since
she
was
a
woman
now
and
not
a
child
and
would
better
understand
emotions
of
love
he
stood
there
shaking
with
passion
what
should
he
do
what
step
should
he
take
then
binko
who
had
emerged
from
his
basket
gave
a
tiny
he
wanted
to
express
his
sympathy
and
excitement
if
his
beloved
master
was
transported
with
rage
it
was
evidently
the
moment
for
him
to
show
some
feeling
also
and
to
go
and
seize
by
the
throat
man
or
beast
who
had
caused
this
tumult
his
round
faithful
adoring
eyes
were
upturned
and
every
fat
wrinkle
quivered
with
love
and
readiness
to
obey
the
smallest
command
while
he
snorted
and
slobbered
with
emotion
something
about
him
touched
michael
and
made
him
stoop
and
seize
him
in
his
arms
and
roll
the
solid
mass
on
the
bed
in
rough
loving
appreciation
you
understand
old
man
he
cried
fondly
you
go
for
henry
or
anyone
or
hold
her
for
me
and
then
the
passion
died
out
of
him
as
the
dog
licked
his
hand
but
we
have
been
brutes
once
too
often
binko
and
now
we
have
to
pay
the
price
she
belongs
to
henry
who
behaved
like
a
gentleman
not
to
us
any
more
so
he
rang
for
his
valet
and
went
to
his
bath
quietly
and
thus
ended
the
storm
of
that
day
and
henry
fordyce
in
london
was
awaiting
the
arrival
of
his
who
with
the
princess
and
cloudwater
was
due
to
be
at
the
ritz
hotel
that
evening
when
they
would
dine
all
together
and
spend
a
time
of
delight
and
far
away
in
brittany
the
père
anselme
read
in
his
book
of
meditations
it
is
when
the
sky
is
clearest
that
the
heaviest
bolt
falls
it
would
be
well
for
all
good
christians
to
be
on
the
alert
and
chancing
to
look
from
his
cottage
window
he
perceived
that
a
heavy
rain
cloud
had
gathered
over
the
château
of
héronac
chapter
xiv
in
the
morning
before
they
left
héronac
sabine
elderly
maid
simone
came
to
her
with
the
face
she
always
wore
when
her
speech
might
contain
any
reference
to
the
past
she
had
been
with
sabine
ever
since
the
week
after
her
marriage
and
was
a
widow
and
a
parisian
with
a
kind
and
motherly
heart
will
madame
take
the
blue
with
her
as
usual
she
asked
sabine
hesitated
for
a
second
she
had
never
gone
anywhere
without
it
in
all
those
five
years
but
now
everything
was
changed
it
might
be
wiser
to
leave
it
safely
at
héronac
then
her
eyes
fell
upon
it
and
a
slight
shudder
came
over
her
of
the
kind
which
people
describe
as
a
goose
walking
over
your
grave
no
she
could
not
leave
it
behind
i
will
take
it
simone
as
madame
wishes
and
the
maid
went
on
her
way
when
sabine
had
reached
london
late
on
that
evening
in
the
june
of
on
her
leaving
scotland
she
found
in
response
to
the
wire
she
had
sent
him
from
edinburgh
parsons
waiting
for
her
at
the
station
his
astonishment
as
great
as
his
perturbation
her
words
had
been
few
her
young
mind
had
been
firmly
made
up
in
the
train
coming
south
no
one
should
ever
know
that
there
had
been
any
deviation
from
the
original
plan
she
had
laid
out
for
herself
with
a
force
of
will
marvellous
in
one
of
her
tender
years
she
had
controlled
her
extreme
emotion
and
except
that
she
looked
very
pale
and
seemed
very
determined
and
quiet
there
were
no
traces
of
the
furnace
through
which
she
had
passed
in
which
had
perished
all
her
old
conceptions
of
existence
although
as
yet
she
realized
nothing
but
that
she
wanted
to
go
away
and
to
be
free
and
forget
her
tremors
and
presently
join
moravia
the
marriage
had
been
perfectly
legal
as
the
certificate
showed
and
parsons
whatever
his
personal
feelings
about
the
matter
were
knew
that
he
had
not
the
smallest
control
over
her
and
was
bound
to
hand
over
to
her
her
money
to
do
with
as
she
pleased
she
merely
told
him
the
facts
that
the
marriage
had
been
only
an
arrangement
to
this
end
arranstoun
having
agreed
before
the
ceremony
that
this
should
be
so
and
that
she
wanted
to
engage
a
good
maid
and
go
over
to
paris
as
soon
as
possible
to
see
her
friend
the
princess
torniloni
she
had
decided
in
the
train
that
her
methods
with
all
who
opposed
her
must
be
as
they
used
to
be
with
sister
jeanne
a
statement
of
her
intentions
and
then
silence
and
no
explanations
sister
jeanne
had
given
up
all
argument
with
her
in
her
last
year
at
the
convent
parsons
soon
found
that
his
words
were
falling
upon
deaf
ears
and
were
perfectly
useless
she
had
cut
herself
adrift
from
her
aunt
and
uncle
whom
she
cordially
disliked
leaving
them
a
letter
to
tell
them
that
as
she
was
now
her
own
mistress
she
never
meant
to
trouble
them
or
greenbank
again
and
she
bid
them
adieu
it
is
not
as
if
they
had
ever
been
the
least
kind
to
me
she
did
condescend
to
inform
the
lawyer
they
could
bear
me
really
samuel
although
he
was
such
a
poor
creature
was
far
the
best
of
them
uncle
was
only
wanting
my
money
for
him
and
aunt
jemima
detested
me
and
only
had
me
with
her
because
papa
left
in
his
will
that
she
had
to
or
lose
his
legacy
you
ca
think
what
i
learned
of
their
meannesses
in
the
month
i
know
them
thus
parsons
had
no
further
arguments
to
use
and
felt
that
after
seeing
her
safe
to
his
own
hotel
that
night
and
helping
to
engage
a
suitable
and
responsible
maid
next
day
to
travel
with
her
he
could
do
no
more
the
question
of
the
name
troubled
him
most
and
he
almost
refused
to
agree
that
she
should
be
known
as
howard
but
i
have
told
arranstoun
that
i
mean
to
be
only
that
sabine
exclaimed
and
he
did
mind
and
here
her
violet
eyes
flashed
i
be
anything
else
so
there
parsons
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
was
impossible
to
deal
with
and
as
he
himself
was
obliged
to
return
to
america
in
the
following
week
he
felt
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
let
her
have
her
way
and
so
well
did
he
guard
his
client
secret
then
and
afterwards
that
even
simone
though
a
shrewd
frenchwoman
had
never
known
that
her
mistress
name
was
not
really
howard
at
the
time
of
her
being
engaged
she
was
just
leaving
an
american
lady
from
the
far
west
whom
parsons
knew
of
and
she
was
delighted
to
come
as
maid
and
almost
chaperon
to
this
sweet
but
wilful
young
lady
so
they
had
gone
to
paris
together
to
order
clothes
such
a
joyous
task
and
to
make
herself
forget
those
hours
so
terribly
full
of
strange
emotion
was
all
which
occupied
sabine
mind
at
this
period
other
preoccupations
came
later
and
it
was
then
that
she
listened
to
suggestion
of
going
to
san
francisco
the
maid
knew
it
well
and
there
they
spent
several
months
in
a
quiet
hotel
but
they
neither
of
them
cared
much
to
remember
those
days
and
nothing
would
have
ever
induced
sabine
to
return
thither
she
thought
of
these
things
now
as
simone
left
the
room
with
the
blue
case
but
she
put
from
her
all
disturbing
remembrances
on
her
journey
to
paris
and
rushed
into
moravia
arms
who
was
waiting
for
her
in
her
palatial
apartment
in
the
avenue
du
bois
they
really
loved
one
another
these
two
women
as
few
sisters
do
sabine
you
darling
the
princess
cried
while
girolamo
kept
up
an
hour
later
to
welcome
his
screamed
with
joy
now
tell
me
everything
everything
pet
moravia
demanded
as
she
poured
out
the
tea
has
the
divorce
been
settled
how
soon
will
you
be
free
when
can
you
get
married
to
this
nice
englishman
i
do
exactly
know
morri
the
law
is
such
a
strange
thing
however
my
husband
has
agreed
and
begun
to
take
the
necessary
steps
by
requesting
me
to
go
back
to
him
which
i
have
refused
to
do
you
are
looking
perfectly
splendid
dear
having
all
that
brain
stimulation
evidently
suits
you
was
the
visit
of
lord
fordyce
delightful
in
that
romantic
old
castle
what
did
you
do
all
the
time
and
what
was
the
friend
like
you
did
not
tell
me
sabine
stirred
her
tea
he
only
stayed
one
night
he
was
quite
a
nice
creature
mr
arranstoun
of
the
castle
the
princess
was
thrilled
why
darling
he
must
be
the
one
that
they
say
is
going
to
marry
daisy
van
der
horn
he
has
got
some
matrimonial
tangle
like
you
have
and
when
he
is
through
with
it
daisy
is
such
dead
nuts
on
him
they
say
she
is
certain
to
get
him
to
marry
her
do
tell
me
exactly
what
he
is
like
i
am
not
over
fond
of
daisy
you
know
but
she
is
a
splendid
specimen
of
dash
and
vim
he
is
morri
and
he
has
got
i
gathered
that
from
all
that
i
have
heard
of
him
here
old
miss
buskin
daisy
aunt
you
remember
the
old
horror
says
he
is
too
sweet
and
sassy
you
know
her
frightfully
vulgar
way
of
speaking
that
even
she
is
to
be
alone
in
the
room
with
him
i
dare
say
he
looked
like
that
he
ought
to
suit
daisy
and
then
sabine
felt
she
had
been
spiteful
and
tried
to
divert
matters
by
asking
where
cloudwater
was
papa
will
be
in
in
a
moment
he
has
been
dying
for
you
to
come
back
but
the
princess
had
not
done
with
arranstoun
yet
the
van
der
horn
coterie
had
rung
with
his
exploits
on
her
return
from
italy
and
the
lurid
picture
had
interested
her
deeply
i
do
wish
i
had
been
at
héronac
sabine
i
would
love
to
have
seen
that
young
man
daisy
aunt
told
me
he
was
wild
about
her
niece
and
at
one
moment
she
thought
everything
was
settled
it
must
have
been
after
he
came
back
from
brittany
and
then
he
went
off
to
england
probably
he
does
not
like
to
speak
out
until
he
is
free
sabine
felt
that
strange
sensation
she
had
experienced
once
before
of
heart
sinking
and
then
furious
with
herself
she
mastered
it
and
became
more
determined
than
ever
to
carry
out
her
intention
of
growing
accustomed
to
hearing
of
and
talking
about
michael
calmly
you
are
sure
to
meet
him
in
england
she
said
he
is
a
great
friend
of
henry
but
afterwards
when
she
was
alone
resting
in
her
cosy
room
before
dinner
she
deliberately
pulled
the
blue
toward
her
and
looked
at
some
of
its
contents
while
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
which
even
the
cynical
thoughts
which
she
was
calling
to
her
aid
could
not
quite
suppress
would
things
have
been
different
if
she
had
been
able
to
send
michael
the
letter
which
she
had
written
to
him
in
the
september
of
the
letter
she
had
asked
parsons
who
was
again
in
london
to
have
delivered
to
him
into
his
hand
and
which
came
back
to
her
in
paris
with
the
information
from
the
old
lawyer
that
arranstoun
had
left
england
for
the
wilds
of
china
and
tibet
and
might
not
get
any
letters
for
more
than
a
year
she
remembered
how
that
night
she
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
with
misery
and
with
a
growing
regret
at
having
left
michael
and
a
pitiful
longing
just
to
be
clasped
once
more
in
his
strong
arms
and
comforted
oh
the
hateful
wretched
memories
to
have
gone
off
at
once
to
china
like
that
proved
his
callousness
and
indifference
then
in
spite
of
herself
her
thoughts
would
review
all
he
had
said
to
her
on
that
morning
in
the
garden
no
there
had
not
been
one
word
of
meaning
not
even
any
suggestion
of
regret
that
she
was
practically
engaged
to
henry
there
had
been
some
faint
allusion
to
people
being
fools
and
brutes
when
young
but
not
that
they
would
wish
to
repair
the
faults
which
they
had
committed
then
the
whole
thing
was
plain
he
had
never
really
cared
an
atom
for
her
he
had
been
only
affected
by
passion
even
on
her
wedding
night
when
he
was
pouring
love
vows
into
her
startled
ears
he
was
probably
horribly
surprised
to
come
upon
me
at
héronac
her
thoughts
now
ran
and
then
just
sampled
me
and
went
off
as
soon
as
he
could
back
to
daisy
in
paris
here
chagrin
began
to
rise
and
soon
dried
all
her
tears
yes
she
hoped
he
would
ask
them
to
arranstoun
she
would
certainly
go
and
try
to
punish
him
as
much
as
she
could
by
showing
her
absorption
in
henry
and
her
complete
indifference
to
himself
his
vanity
would
be
wounded
since
he
had
owned
to
being
a
dog
in
the
manger
that
would
be
her
only
revenge
and
what
a
paltry
one
she
felt
that
and
was
ashamed
of
herself
but
all
human
beings
are
paltry
when
their
is
wounded
and
the
passion
of
jealousy
has
them
in
its
thrall
and
sabine
was
no
better
nor
worse
than
any
other
woman
probably
once
more
she
made
resolutions
firm
resolutions
to
think
no
more
of
michael
either
good
or
bad
it
was
perfectly
sickening
the
humiliation
and
degradation
of
his
so
frequently
coming
into
her
mind
she
pulled
the
nearer
to
her
again
and
in
anger
and
contempt
took
from
an
envelope
a
brown
and
withered
spray
of
flowers
which
had
once
been
stephanotis
and
with
forceful
rage
flung
them
into
the
fire
there
that
is
done
with
ridiculous
hateful
sentiment
go
and
when
she
had
shut
the
lid
down
with
a
snap
she
rang
for
simone
and
began
to
dress
for
dinner
an
extra
flush
burning
in
her
cheeks
they
crossed
to
england
a
week
or
so
later
lord
fordyce
meeting
them
at
charing
cross
and
going
with
them
to
the
hotel
how
dear
he
seemed
and
how
distinguished
he
looked
he
was
as
ever
a
soothing
and
uplifting
influence
and
before
the
evening
was
over
sabine
felt
calmed
and
happy
and
sure
she
had
done
the
right
thing
in
deciding
to
link
her
life
with
his
but
it
was
not
so
with
moravia
lord
fordyce
had
attracted
her
from
the
moment
she
had
first
seen
him
and
as
things
do
during
periods
of
time
unconsciously
this
feeling
had
simmered
and
upon
seeing
him
again
had
boiled
up
and
alas
moravia
beautiful
young
widow
and
princess
found
herself
extremely
perturbed
and
excited
and
undoubtedly
becoming
deeply
interested
in
the
declared
lover
of
her
friend
henry
for
her
had
every
charm
he
was
gentle
and
courteous
he
was
witty
and
calm
with
that
consciousness
which
she
adored
in
englishmen
and
which
sabine
had
always
said
irritated
her
so
it
was
all
too
exasperating
because
with
her
unerring
feminine
instinct
she
divined
that
sabine
really
did
not
love
him
at
all
if
she
had
felt
that
she
did
moravia
could
have
borne
it
better
but
as
it
was
fate
was
too
hard
and
when
a
week
went
by
the
princess
began
actually
to
feel
unhappy
they
were
continually
surrounded
with
friends
and
at
every
meal
had
the
kind
of
parties
that
once
she
had
taken
such
delight
in
people
were
just
beginning
to
come
back
to
london
and
they
had
amusing
play
dinners
and
what
not
and
all
henry
family
an
intelligent
and
aristocratic
band
had
showered
attention
upon
them
the
princess
had
very
seldom
been
in
london
before
and
quite
understood
that
but
for
the
one
particular
cherry
being
out
of
reach
which
spoilt
all
her
joy
she
could
have
been
to
use
one
of
miss
van
der
horn
pet
expressions
terribly
amused
sabine
as
the
days
wore
on
and
she
was
under
henry
influence
again
lost
her
feeling
of
unrest
and
grew
happy
and
heard
michael
name
without
a
tremor
for
moravia
dragged
him
into
the
conversation
by
saying
how
much
she
would
like
to
meet
him
after
all
she
had
heard
of
him
in
paris
i
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
lord
fordyce
said
he
is
shooting
in
norfolk
at
this
moment
but
comes
up
to
town
on
friday
night
i
will
ask
him
to
dine
then
princess
and
you
shall
see
what
you
think
of
him
he
really
is
a
very
charming
fellow
for
all
his
recklessness
and
i
expect
half
those
enchanting
tales
they
told
you
of
him
are
overdrawn
oh
i
hope
not
moravia
laughed
do
not
disillusion
me
next
day
henry
told
them
that
he
had
wired
to
arranstoun
who
had
wired
back
that
he
was
very
sorry
he
could
not
dine
with
them
on
friday
and
go
to
a
play
so
lord
fordyce
promised
the
princess
he
would
find
another
occasion
to
present
his
friend
to
him
henry
this
week
in
late
october
had
been
one
of
almost
unalloyed
happiness
although
he
could
have
dispensed
with
the
continuous
parties
still
he
felt
the
princess
had
to
be
amused
and
perhaps
in
a
larger
company
he
got
more
chance
of
speaking
to
his
beloved
alone
the
position
of
a
man
nearly
always
affects
women
and
the
great
and
unmistakable
prestige
which
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
henry
possessed
had
added
to
his
charm
in
both
moravia
and
sabine
eyes
it
gratified
sabine
vanity
she
knew
this
she
was
quite
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
it
pleased
her
she
felt
glad
and
proud
that
she
should
occupy
so
exalted
a
place
in
the
world
eyes
as
she
would
do
as
his
wife
surely
all
the
great
duties
and
interests
of
that
position
would
make
life
very
fair
it
would
be
such
peace
and
relief
when
the
divorce
proceedings
would
come
on
and
be
finished
with
a
much
less
tiresome
affair
in
scotland
she
had
heard
than
in
an
english
court
when
michael
arranstoun
got
henry
wire
asking
him
to
dine
he
laughed
bitterly
there
was
something
so
cynically
entertaining
in
the
idea
of
the
whole
situation
he
was
being
asked
out
to
meet
the
wife
whom
he
was
madly
in
love
with
and
was
preparing
to
divorce
for
desertion
so
that
she
might
marry
the
giver
of
the
invitation
he
was
tempted
to
accept
for
a
second
or
two
the
desire
to
see
her
again
was
growing
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
but
at
this
period
he
had
still
strength
to
refuse
and
then
as
the
days
went
on
it
seemed
that
nothing
gave
him
any
pleasure
and
that
constantly
and
incessantly
his
thoughts
turned
to
one
subject
if
there
had
been
no
friendship
or
honor
mixed
up
in
the
thing
nothing
would
have
been
simpler
than
to
sit
down
and
write
to
henry
telling
him
plainly
that
sabine
was
his
wife
and
that
she
must
choose
between
them
but
then
he
remembered
that
apart
from
all
friendship
sabine
had
already
plainly
expressed
her
choice
and
that
he
had
absolutely
no
right
to
hold
her
in
any
way
since
he
had
given
her
permission
all
those
years
ago
to
make
what
she
chose
of
her
life
he
had
not
yet
instructed
his
lawyers
to
begin
actual
proceedings
he
was
in
a
furnace
of
indecision
and
unrest
he
would
like
just
somehow
to
get
sabine
to
arranstoun
first
then
if
after
that
she
still
plainly
showed
that
she
loved
henry
he
would
make
himself
go
ahead
with
the
freedom
scheme
but
if
he
commenced
actual
proceedings
now
by
no
possibility
could
she
come
to
arranstoun
and
this
idea
to
get
her
to
arranstoun
began
to
be
an
obsession
just
in
proportion
as
his
nature
was
wild
and
rebellious
so
the
mad
longing
grew
and
grew
in
him
to
induce
her
to
come
once
more
into
his
house
and
it
would
seem
that
fate
at
first
intended
to
assist
him
in
this
for
on
the
second
of
november
the
party
went
up
north
to
stay
with
rose
forster
henry
sister
at
ebbsworth
for
a
great
ball
she
was
giving
for
a
newly
married
niece
chapter
xv
for
a
day
or
two
michael
arranstoun
could
not
make
up
his
mind
when
he
heard
of
the
ebbsworth
ball
as
to
whether
or
no
he
ought
to
go
to
it
he
had
several
conversations
with
binko
upon
the
subject
and
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
go
he
had
grown
so
desperately
unhappy
by
this
time
that
he
cared
no
more
whether
it
were
right
or
wrong
he
must
see
sabine
he
had
not
believed
that
it
could
be
possible
for
him
to
suffer
to
such
a
degree
about
a
woman
he
satisfy
himself
absolutely
as
to
the
fact
of
her
loving
henry
rose
forster
had
written
of
course
to
ask
him
to
stay
in
the
house
for
it
holding
out
the
bait
that
she
had
two
absolutely
charming
americans
coming
so
michael
fell
and
accepted
not
without
excusing
himself
to
binko
as
he
finished
writing
out
his
wire
thousand
thanks
i
will
come
i
am
a
coward
binko
i
ought
to
have
the
pluck
to
go
off
to
timbuctoo
and
let
henry
have
a
fair
field
but
i
have
and
must
be
certain
first
they
were
all
at
tea
in
the
library
at
ebbsworth
when
he
arrived
having
motored
over
from
arranstoun
after
lunch
everyone
was
enchanted
to
see
him
and
greeted
him
with
delight
he
knew
almost
the
whole
twenty
of
them
most
of
whom
were
old
friends
the
hostess
took
him
over
to
the
tea
table
and
sitting
near
it
in
a
ravishing
was
moravia
rose
forster
introduced
him
casually
while
she
poured
him
out
some
tea
the
library
was
a
big
room
with
one
or
two
tall
screens
and
from
behind
the
furthest
one
there
came
a
low
rippling
laugh
the
sound
of
it
maddened
michael
and
his
bold
blue
eyes
blazed
as
he
began
to
talk
to
the
princess
his
naturally
easy
manners
made
him
able
to
carry
on
some
kind
of
a
conversation
but
his
whole
attention
was
fixed
upon
the
whereabouts
of
sabine
she
was
with
henry
of
course
behind
that
spanish
leather
screen
he
hardly
even
noticed
that
moravia
was
a
very
pretty
woman
most
wonderfully
dressed
but
he
felt
she
was
a
powerful
unit
in
his
game
of
getting
sabine
to
arranstoun
and
so
he
endeavored
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
her
presently
in
the
general
move
lord
fordyce
and
his
lady
love
emerged
with
two
other
people
they
had
been
talking
to
and
henry
came
up
to
michael
with
outstretched
hand
he
was
awfully
glad
to
see
him
he
said
then
this
estranged
husband
and
wife
were
face
to
face
it
was
a
wonderful
moment
for
both
of
them
and
with
all
the
schooling
that
each
one
had
been
through
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
behave
naturally
michael
did
not
fight
with
himself
except
to
keep
from
all
outward
expression
he
knew
he
was
simply
overcome
with
emotion
but
sabine
continued
to
throw
dust
in
her
own
eyes
the
sudden
wild
beating
of
her
heart
she
put
down
to
every
other
reason
but
the
true
one
it
was
most
wrong
of
michael
to
have
come
to
this
party
but
it
was
of
course
done
out
of
bravado
to
show
her
that
she
did
not
matter
to
him
at
all
so
with
supreme
sangfroid
she
greeted
him
casually
and
then
turned
eyes
of
tenderness
to
henry
you
were
going
to
show
me
the
miniatures
in
the
next
room
lord
fordyce
were
you
not
she
said
sweetly
and
took
a
step
on
toward
the
door
leaving
michael
with
pain
and
rage
for
company
she
had
never
allowed
henry
to
kiss
her
since
that
one
occasion
at
héronac
it
was
not
as
it
should
be
she
affirmed
until
she
were
free
and
really
engaged
to
him
she
prayed
him
to
behave
always
only
as
a
friend
lord
fordyce
acquiesced
as
he
would
have
done
to
any
penance
she
chose
to
impose
upon
him
and
in
his
secret
thoughts
rather
respected
her
for
her
decision
he
was
then
more
than
delighted
when
she
put
her
slender
hand
upon
his
arm
with
possessive
familiarity
as
soon
as
they
had
reached
the
anteroom
where
the
collection
of
miniatures
were
kept
but
he
did
not
know
that
she
was
aware
that
michael
stood
where
he
could
see
them
through
the
archway
my
darling
and
he
lifted
the
white
fingers
to
his
lips
sabine
had
particularly
beautiful
hands
and
they
were
his
delight
she
never
wore
any
rings
only
her
and
the
one
great
pearl
henry
had
persuaded
her
to
let
him
give
her
but
this
was
on
her
right
hand
it
would
mean
nothing
for
me
to
have
it
on
the
left
one
while
that
bar
of
gold
is
there
she
had
told
him
i
will
only
take
it
if
you
let
me
have
it
as
a
gage
of
friendship
and
as
ever
he
agreed
he
was
so
passionately
in
love
with
her
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
he
would
not
have
done
or
left
undone
to
please
her
his
eye
followed
her
always
with
rapture
and
her
slightest
wish
was
instantly
obeyed
sabine
was
naturally
an
autocrat
and
but
for
the
great
generosity
of
her
spirit
might
have
made
him
suffer
considerably
but
she
did
not
being
consistently
gentle
and
sweet
my
darling
henry
repeated
in
the
little
anteroom
while
his
fond
eyes
devoured
her
face
sometimes
i
love
you
so
it
frightens
me
my
god
if
anything
were
to
take
you
from
me
now
i
do
not
think
i
could
bear
it
sabine
shivered
as
she
bent
down
to
look
at
a
case
of
cosways
in
a
show
table
nothing
can
take
you
from
me
henry
unless
something
goes
wrong
about
the
divorce
my
lawyer
arrives
in
england
from
america
on
purpose
to
consult
me
and
see
what
can
be
done
to
hasten
matters
my
husband
has
not
as
yet
started
the
proceedings
it
seems
lord
fordyce
face
paled
does
that
mean
anything
sinister
dearest
he
demanded
with
a
quiver
in
his
cultivated
voice
sabine
you
would
tell
me
would
you
not
if
there
were
anything
to
fear
i
do
not
myself
know
what
it
means
i
may
have
some
news
let
us
forget
about
it
oh
i
want
to
be
happy
just
for
henry
and
she
held
out
her
hand
again
pleadingly
indeed
you
shall
be
darling
and
splendid
and
unselfish
gentleman
that
he
was
he
crushed
down
his
anguish
and
used
all
his
clever
brain
to
divert
and
entertain
her
and
presently
all
the
women
went
up
to
dress
for
dinner
and
the
ball
and
lord
fordyce
found
michael
in
the
he
had
really
a
deep
affection
for
him
he
had
known
him
ever
since
he
was
an
absolutely
fearless
little
boy
the
joy
and
pride
of
his
father
henry
old
friend
and
in
spite
of
the
full
ten
years
difference
in
their
ages
they
had
ever
been
closest
allies
until
their
break
at
arranstoun
and
then
michael
five
years
abroad
had
made
a
gap
bridged
over
now
since
his
return
lord
fordyce
felt
that
michael
intense
vitality
and
radiating
magnetism
would
be
refreshing
in
the
depressed
state
into
which
his
lady
love
words
had
thrown
him
and
he
drew
him
over
with
him
and
they
sat
down
in
two
big
chairs
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
festive
groups
some
playing
bridge
or
billiards
michael
was
in
no
gentle
temper
and
henry
was
the
last
person
he
wished
to
talk
to
he
knew
he
ought
not
to
have
come
he
knew
that
he
ought
to
tell
henry
straight
out
and
then
go
off
before
the
ball
he
felt
he
was
behaving
like
the
most
despicable
coward
and
yet
if
it
were
possible
for
henry
never
to
know
that
he
michael
was
sabine
husband
it
would
save
his
friend
much
pain
he
was
smarting
under
sabine
insolent
dismissal
of
him
and
burning
with
jealousy
over
that
witnessed
caress
the
violent
passions
of
his
race
were
surging
up
and
causing
a
devil
of
recklessness
to
show
in
his
very
handsome
face
lord
fordyce
saw
that
something
had
disturbed
him
what
up
michael
old
boy
he
asked
i
have
seen
you
look
so
like
black
james
since
you
got
violet
hatfield
letter
and
did
not
see
how
you
could
get
out
of
marrying
her
black
james
was
a
famous
arranstoun
of
the
court
of
james
iv
of
scotland
whose
exploits
had
been
the
terror
and
admiration
of
the
whole
country
and
who
was
even
yet
a
byword
for
recklessness
and
savagery
michael
laughed
poor
old
violet
he
said
she
will
soon
be
bringing
out
her
daughter
i
saw
her
the
other
day
in
london
she
cut
me
dead
that
was
an
escape
and
henry
lit
a
cigar
however
as
you
know
a
year
after
weeping
crocodile
tears
for
poor
maurice
she
married
young
layard
of
balmayn
so
all
well
that
ends
well
she
and
rose
have
never
spoken
since
the
scene
when
violet
read
in
the
that
you
had
got
married
do
let
talk
of
it
returned
arranstoun
the
whole
thought
of
marriage
and
matrimony
makes
me
sick
are
you
in
some
fresh
scrape
henry
exclaimed
michael
put
his
head
down
doggedly
while
his
eyes
flashed
and
he
bit
off
the
end
of
his
cigar
yes
the
very
devil
of
a
hole
but
this
time
no
one
can
help
me
with
advice
or
even
sympathy
i
must
get
out
of
the
tangle
myself
i
am
awfully
sorry
old
man
it
is
my
own
fault
that
is
what
hurts
the
most
i
do
not
feel
particularly
brilliant
either
henry
announced
the
divorce
proceedings
have
not
apparently
been
commenced
in
america
and
nothing
definite
can
be
settled
i
do
not
understand
it
quite
i
always
thought
that
out
there
the
woman
could
always
get
matters
manipulated
for
her
and
get
rid
of
the
man
when
she
wanted
they
are
so
very
chivalrous
to
women
american
men
whatever
may
be
their
other
sins
this
one
must
be
an
absolute
swine
yes
does
howard
feel
it
very
much
and
michael
deep
voice
vibrated
strangely
she
spoke
of
it
just
now
her
lawyer
arrives
from
new
york
to
consult
with
her
what
is
best
next
to
be
done
and
she
never
told
you
a
thing
about
the
fellow
henry
how
very
strange
of
her
is
it
lord
fordyce
fine
gray
eyes
gleamed
ah
michael
if
you
had
ever
loved
a
woman
you
would
know
that
when
you
really
do
you
desire
to
trust
her
to
the
uttermost
sabine
would
tell
me
and
offered
to
at
once
if
i
wished
but
it
all
upsets
her
so
i
agree
with
her
it
is
much
happier
for
both
of
us
not
to
talk
about
it
only
if
there
seems
to
be
some
hitch
i
will
get
her
to
tell
me
so
that
i
may
be
able
to
help
her
i
have
a
fairly
clear
judgment
generally
and
may
see
some
points
she
and
parsons
have
neglected
michael
gazed
into
the
fire
at
this
moment
his
worst
enemy
might
have
pitied
him
supposing
anything
were
to
go
really
wrong
henry
it
would
cut
you
up
awfully
eh
and
if
lord
fordyce
had
not
been
so
preoccupied
with
his
own
emotions
he
would
have
seen
an
on
the
face
of
his
friend
i
believe
it
would
just
end
my
life
michael
he
answered
very
low
i
am
not
a
boy
you
know
to
get
over
it
and
begin
again
arranstoun
bounded
from
his
chair
nothing
must
be
allowed
to
go
wrong
then
old
man
he
exclaimed
almost
fiercely
do
you
fret
but
by
jove
we
will
be
late
for
dinner
and
afraid
to
trust
himself
to
say
another
word
he
turned
to
one
of
the
groups
near
and
at
last
got
from
the
room
he
did
not
go
up
to
his
own
but
on
into
the
front
hall
and
so
out
into
the
night
a
brisk
wind
was
blowing
and
the
moon
a
young
frosty
moon
was
bright
he
knew
the
place
well
and
paced
a
stone
terrace
undisturbed
it
was
on
the
other
side
all
was
noise
and
bustle
where
the
large
built
out
stood
an
absolute
decision
must
be
come
to
no
more
he
had
thrown
the
dice
and
lost
and
must
pay
the
stakes
he
would
ask
her
to
dance
this
night
and
then
get
speech
with
her
alone
discuss
what
would
be
best
to
do
to
save
henry
and
then
on
the
morrow
go
and
begin
proceedings
immediately
meanwhile
up
in
moravia
room
sabine
was
seated
upon
the
white
rug
before
the
fire
she
was
wildly
excited
and
extremely
unhappy
the
sight
of
michael
again
had
upset
all
her
fancied
indifference
and
shaken
her
poise
and
apart
from
this
the
situation
was
grotesque
and
unseemly
she
could
no
longer
suffer
it
she
would
tell
henry
the
whole
truth
and
ask
him
what
she
must
do
his
love
almost
terrified
her
what
awful
responsibility
lay
in
her
hand
but
civilization
commanded
her
to
dress
in
her
best
and
go
down
and
dance
gaily
and
play
her
part
in
the
world
oh
what
slaves
we
are
morri
she
exclaimed
as
though
speaking
her
thoughts
aloud
for
the
remark
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
the
princess
had
said
moravia
who
was
lying
on
the
sofa
not
in
the
best
of
moods
either
answered
gloomily
yes
slaves
or
savages
the
truth
is
we
are
nearly
all
animals
more
or
less
some
are
caught
by
wiles
and
some
are
trapped
and
some
revel
in
being
captured
and
a
few
a
few
are
like
me
they
get
away
as
a
bird
with
a
shot
in
its
wing
sabine
was
startled
what
was
agitating
her
friend
but
your
troubles
are
over
morri
darling
your
wings
are
strong
and
free
i
said
there
was
a
shot
in
one
of
them
sabine
came
and
sat
upon
a
stool
beside
her
and
took
and
caressed
her
hand
something
has
hurt
you
dearest
she
cooed
rubbing
moravia
arm
with
her
velvet
cheek
what
is
it
no
i
am
not
hurt
i
am
only
cynical
i
despise
our
sex
most
of
us
are
just
primitive
savages
underneath
at
one
time
of
our
lives
or
another
we
adore
the
strong
man
who
captures
us
in
spite
of
all
our
struggles
morri
it
is
perfectly
true
we
all
pass
through
it
in
the
beginning
when
girolamo
devoured
me
with
kisses
and
raged
with
jealousy
and
one
day
almost
beat
me
i
absolutely
worshipped
him
it
was
when
he
became
polite
and
then
yawned
that
my
misery
began
you
will
go
through
it
sabine
if
you
have
not
already
done
so
it
seems
we
suffer
all
the
time
because
when
that
is
over
then
we
learn
to
appreciate
gentleness
and
chivalry
and
probably
by
then
it
is
out
of
our
reach
i
do
believe
anything
is
out
of
our
reach
if
we
want
it
enough
and
sabine
closed
her
firm
mouth
then
i
wonder
what
you
want
sabine
because
i
know
you
do
not
really
want
lord
fordyce
he
represents
chivalry
and
i
do
believe
you
are
at
that
stage
yet
dearest
what
stage
am
i
at
then
morri
the
one
when
you
want
a
master
you
have
mastered
everything
yourself
up
to
now
but
the
moment
will
come
to
you
and
then
you
will
be
fortunate
perhaps
if
fate
keeps
the
man
away
sabine
violet
eyes
grew
black
as
night
and
her
little
nostrils
quivered
i
know
nothing
of
passions
moravia
she
cried
and
threw
out
her
arms
i
have
only
dreamed
of
them
imagined
them
i
am
afraid
of
them
afraid
to
feel
too
much
henry
will
be
a
haven
of
rest
the
moment
can
never
come
to
me
the
princess
laughed
a
little
bitterly
then
let
us
dress
darling
and
go
down
and
outshine
all
these
dear
dowdy
englishwomen
and
while
you
are
sipping
courtesy
and
gentleness
with
lord
fordyce
i
shall
try
to
quaff
gloriously
attractive
aboriginal
force
with
arranstoun
but
it
would
have
been
more
suitable
to
our
characters
could
we
have
changed
partners
now
run
along
chapter
xvi
rose
forster
had
felt
she
must
not
lure
arranstoun
over
to
ebbsworth
on
false
pretences
he
was
a
very
much
sought
after
young
man
and
since
his
return
from
the
wilds
had
been
very
difficult
to
secure
and
therefore
it
was
her
duty
to
give
him
one
of
her
beautiful
americans
at
dinner
the
princess
was
obviously
the
destiny
of
her
husband
with
her
brother
henry
upon
the
other
side
so
michael
must
take
in
howard
arranstoun
was
one
of
the
last
two
guests
to
assemble
in
the
great
where
the
party
were
collected
and
did
not
hear
of
his
good
fortune
until
one
minute
before
dinner
was
announced
sabine
had
perhaps
never
looked
so
well
in
her
life
she
had
not
her
father
nation
love
of
splendid
jewels
and
wore
none
of
any
kind
her
french
mother
may
have
transmitted
to
her
some
wonderful
strain
of
tastes
which
from
earliest
youth
had
seemed
to
guide
her
into
selecting
the
most
beautiful
and
becoming
things
without
great
knowledge
her
ugly
frocks
at
the
convent
had
been
a
penance
and
ever
since
she
had
been
free
and
rich
her
clothes
and
all
her
belongings
had
been
marvels
of
distinction
and
simplicity
moravia
was
strictly
speaking
far
more
beautiful
but
sabine
as
henry
had
once
said
had
it
her
manner
was
just
what
it
ought
to
have
been
as
she
placed
her
hand
upon
her
husband
arm
perfectly
indifferent
and
gracious
and
so
they
went
in
to
dinner
michael
had
hardly
hoped
to
have
this
chance
and
meant
to
make
the
most
of
it
at
dinner
before
a
ball
was
not
the
place
to
have
a
serious
discussion
about
divorce
but
was
for
lighter
and
more
frivolous
conversation
and
he
felt
his
partner
would
be
no
unskilled
adversary
with
the
foils
so
you
have
got
this
far
north
howard
he
began
by
saying
making
a
slight
pause
over
the
name
i
wish
i
could
persuade
you
to
come
over
the
border
to
arranstoun
it
is
only
miles
from
here
and
really
merits
your
attention
i
have
heard
it
is
a
most
interesting
place
sabine
returned
suddenly
experiencing
the
same
wild
delight
in
the
game
as
she
had
done
in
the
garden
at
héronac
have
you
ghosts
there
we
do
not
have
such
things
in
france
yes
there
are
a
number
of
ghosts
but
the
most
persistent
and
disconcerting
one
is
a
very
young
girl
who
nightly
falls
through
a
secret
door
into
my
room
how
romantic
what
is
she
like
two
violet
eyes
looked
up
at
him
full
of
that
mischief
which
lies
in
the
orbs
of
a
kitten
when
it
contemplates
some
fearsome
crime
and
has
to
appear
especially
innocent
michael
thrilled
if
she
had
that
expression
he
was
quite
ready
to
follow
the
lead
she
is
perfectly
enchanting
shall
i
tell
you
exactly
what
she
wears
and
her
every
feature
and
the
color
of
her
eyes
the
wraith
so
materializes
that
i
can
describe
it
as
accurately
as
i
could
describe
you
sitting
next
me
please
do
she
is
about
five
foot
seven
tall
i
mean
she
has
grown
as
tall
as
that
when
she
first
appeared
she
could
not
have
been
taller
than
five
foot
five
how
strange
yes
is
it
well
she
has
the
most
divine
figure
quite
slight
and
yet
not
scraggy
you
know
the
kind
i
loathe
them
scraggy
i
hate
fat
people
but
she
is
fat
i
tell
you
she
is
too
sweet
she
has
a
round
baby
face
with
the
loveliest
violet
eyes
in
the
world
and
such
a
skin
like
a
velvet
rose
petal
his
unabashed
regard
penetrated
sabine
who
smiled
slyly
you
do
mean
to
say
you
can
see
all
these
material
things
in
a
ghost
she
cried
with
an
enchanting
air
of
incredulity
perfectly
i
have
not
half
finished
yet
i
have
not
told
you
about
her
mouth
it
is
very
curved
and
full
and
awfully
red
and
there
is
the
most
adorable
dimple
up
at
one
side
of
it
i
am
sure
the
people
in
the
ghost
world
that
she
meets
must
awfully
want
to
kiss
it
sabine
frowned
this
was
rather
too
intimate
a
description
but
bashfulness
or
diffidence
she
knew
were
not
among
qualities
or
defects
i
think
i
am
tired
of
hearing
what
this
ghost
looks
like
i
want
to
know
what
does
she
do
are
you
petrified
with
fright
not
in
the
least
michael
told
her
but
you
will
just
have
to
hear
about
her
hair
when
it
comes
down
it
is
like
lovely
bronze
waves
and
her
little
feet
too
they
are
exquisite
enough
in
shoes
and
stockings
but
without
here
he
had
the
grace
to
look
at
his
fish
which
was
just
being
handed
a
flush
as
pink
as
the
pinkest
rose
came
into
sabine
cheeks
he
was
perfectly
disgraceful
and
this
was
of
course
in
shocking
taste
but
when
he
glanced
up
again
his
attractive
blue
eyes
had
her
late
look
of
an
innocent
kitten
in
them
and
he
said
in
an
angelic
tone
she
has
not
a
fault
you
may
believe
me
and
she
jumps
up
after
the
fall
into
the
room
and
sits
in
one
of
my
big
chairs
does
she
scold
you
for
your
sins
as
denizens
of
another
sphere
ought
to
do
howard
was
constrained
to
ask
no
she
is
a
little
angel
and
always
tells
me
that
sins
are
forgiven
does
she
come
often
every
single
evening
when
i
am
alone
and
sometimes
she
melts
into
my
arms
and
stays
with
me
all
night
binko
ah
you
remember
binko
for
sabine
face
had
suddenly
lit
up
and
at
this
passionate
joy
and
emotion
flooded
michael
and
they
both
stopped
dead
short
in
their
talk
and
sabine
took
a
quick
breath
that
was
almost
a
gasp
i
remember
nothing
she
said
very
fast
how
should
i
the
girl
whose
ghost
you
are
speaking
of
ceased
to
exist
five
years
ago
but
i
recognize
the
portrait
i
knew
her
in
life
and
she
told
me
about
the
dog
he
had
fat
paws
and
quantities
of
wrinkles
i
think
she
said
yes
that
is
binko
and
his
master
beamed
rapturously
he
is
the
most
beautifully
ugly
bulldog
in
the
world
but
the
poor
old
boy
is
getting
on
he
is
seven
years
old
now
would
not
you
like
to
see
him
again
i
mean
from
what
you
have
heard
i
love
animals
especially
dogs
but
tell
me
is
he
not
afraid
of
the
ghost
michael
drank
some
champagne
even
under
all
his
unhappiness
he
was
greatly
enjoying
himself
not
at
all
he
loves
her
to
come
as
much
as
i
do
she
haunts
both
my
rooms
and
the
chapel
too
she
wears
a
white
dress
and
has
some
stephanotis
in
her
hair
and
i
am
somehow
compelled
to
enact
a
whole
scene
with
her
there
before
the
altar
with
all
the
candles
blazing
and
it
seems
as
if
i
put
a
ring
upon
her
hand
like
the
one
you
are
wearing
there
she
has
lovely
hands
the
color
began
to
die
out
of
sabine
cheeks
and
a
strange
look
grew
in
her
eyes
the
footmen
were
removing
the
fish
plates
but
she
was
oblivious
of
that
then
the
tones
of
michael
voice
changed
and
grew
deeper
soon
all
the
vision
fades
into
gloom
and
the
only
thing
i
can
see
is
that
she
is
tearing
my
ring
off
and
throwing
it
away
into
the
darkness
and
do
you
try
to
prevent
her
from
doing
this
sabine
hardly
spoke
above
a
whisper
while
she
absently
refused
an
entrée
which
was
being
handed
to
talk
of
ghosts
and
such
like
things
had
been
easy
enough
but
she
had
not
bargained
for
him
turning
the
conversation
into
one
of
serious
meaning
she
could
not
however
prevent
herself
from
continuing
it
she
had
never
been
so
interested
in
her
life
no
i
can
not
do
that
there
is
an
archangel
standing
between
at
this
moment
howard
other
neighbor
claimed
her
attention
he
was
a
man
to
whom
she
had
been
talking
at
tea
and
who
was
already
filled
with
admiration
for
her
michael
had
time
for
breathing
space
and
to
consider
whether
the
course
he
was
pursuing
was
wisdom
or
not
that
it
was
madly
exciting
he
knew
but
where
was
it
leading
to
what
did
she
mean
did
she
feel
at
all
or
was
she
one
of
the
clever
coquettes
of
her
nation
a
more
refined
daisy
van
der
horn
just
going
to
lead
him
on
into
showing
his
emotion
for
her
and
then
going
to
punish
and
humiliate
him
he
must
put
a
firmer
guard
over
himself
for
propinquity
and
the
night
were
exciting
influence
and
the
cruel
fact
remained
that
it
was
too
late
in
any
case
henry
words
this
afternoon
had
cast
the
die
forever
he
michael
could
not
for
any
personal
happiness
be
so
hideously
cruel
to
his
old
friend
better
put
a
bullet
through
his
own
brain
than
that
whatever
should
develop
on
this
night
and
he
meant
to
continue
the
conversation
as
it
should
seem
best
to
him
and
if
she
fenced
too
daringly
with
him
to
take
the
button
off
the
foils
but
whatever
should
come
of
it
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
alter
his
intention
of
instructing
his
lawyers
in
edinburgh
to
begin
divorce
proceedings
at
once
he
was
like
a
gambler
who
has
lost
his
last
stake
and
who
still
means
to
take
what
joy
of
life
he
can
before
the
black
dawns
so
in
the
ten
minutes
or
so
while
sabine
had
turned
from
him
he
laid
his
plans
he
would
see
how
much
he
could
make
her
feel
he
would
dance
with
her
later
and
then
say
a
final
farewell
if
she
were
hurt
too
he
must
not
care
she
had
made
the
barrier
of
her
own
free
will
the
person
who
was
blameless
and
should
not
suffer
was
henry
then
he
began
to
look
at
sabine
furtively
and
caught
the
outline
of
her
sweet
averted
head
how
irresistibly
attractive
she
was
the
exact
type
he
admired
not
too
just
soft
and
round
and
babyish
there
was
one
little
curl
on
her
snowy
that
he
longed
to
kiss
there
and
then
what
a
time
she
was
talking
to
the
other
man
he
would
not
bear
it
and
sabine
while
she
apparently
listened
to
her
neighbor
had
not
the
remotest
idea
of
what
he
said
the
whole
of
her
being
was
thrilling
with
some
strange
and
powerful
emotion
which
almost
made
her
feel
faint
she
could
not
have
swallowed
a
morsel
of
food
and
simply
played
with
her
fork
at
the
first
possible
pause
michael
addressed
her
again
since
you
knew
the
lady
in
life
who
is
now
my
ghost
and
she
told
you
of
binko
did
she
not
say
anything
else
about
her
visit
to
arranstoun
or
its
master
nothing
it
was
all
apparently
a
blank
horror
and
she
probably
wanted
to
forget
it
and
him
he
made
some
kind
of
an
impression
upon
her
then
good
or
bad
since
she
wanted
to
forget
him
eagerly
sabine
admitted
to
herself
that
the
umpires
might
have
called
for
this
it
would
seem
so
she
allowed
with
what
she
thought
was
generosity
that
is
better
than
only
creating
indifference
yes
the
indifference
came
later
one
expected
that
but
there
was
a
time
you
have
inferred
when
she
felt
something
what
was
it
ca
you
tell
me
excitement
was
rising
high
now
in
both
of
them
and
the
grouse
on
their
plates
remained
almost
untasted
at
first
she
did
not
know
herself
i
think
but
afterwards
when
she
came
to
understand
things
she
felt
resentment
and
hate
and
it
taught
her
to
appreciate
chivalry
and
gentleness
michael
almost
cried
aloud
he
was
an
awful
brute
the
owner
of
arranstoun
i
suppose
yes
apparently
and
one
who
broke
a
contract
and
rather
glorified
in
the
fact
michael
laughed
a
little
bitterly
as
he
answered
all
men
are
brutes
when
the
moment
favors
them
and
when
a
woman
is
sufficiently
attractive
we
will
admit
that
the
owner
of
arranstoun
was
a
brute
he
was
a
man
who
i
understand
lived
only
for
himself
and
for
his
personal
gratification
howard
told
him
poor
devil
he
perhaps
had
not
had
much
chance
you
should
be
charitable
sabine
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
that
engaging
way
she
had
she
had
hardly
looked
up
again
at
michael
since
the
beginning
the
exigencies
of
the
being
excuse
enough
for
not
turning
her
head
but
his
eyes
often
devoured
her
fascinating
irregular
profile
to
try
and
discover
her
real
meaning
but
without
success
he
was
probably
one
of
those
people
who
are
more
or
less
like
animals
and
just
live
because
they
are
alive
sabine
went
on
who
are
educated
because
they
happen
to
have
been
born
in
the
upper
classes
who
drink
and
eat
and
sport
and
game
because
it
gives
their
senses
pleasure
so
to
do
but
who
see
no
further
good
in
things
a
low
wretch
yes
more
or
less
michael
eyes
were
flashing
now
and
she
did
peep
at
him
when
he
said
but
if
the
original
of
the
ghost
had
stayed
with
him
she
might
have
been
able
to
change
this
base
view
of
life
she
could
have
elevated
him
sabine
shook
her
head
no
she
was
too
young
and
too
inexperienced
and
he
had
broken
all
her
ideals
absolutely
stunned
and
annihilated
her
whole
vista
of
the
future
there
was
no
other
way
but
flight
she
had
to
reconstruct
her
soul
alone
you
do
not
ask
me
what
became
of
the
owner
of
arranstoun
or
what
he
did
with
his
life
i
know
he
went
to
china
but
the
matter
does
not
interest
me
there
he
probably
continued
to
live
and
to
kill
other
things
to
seize
what
he
wanted
and
get
some
physical
joy
out
of
existence
as
usual
a
look
of
pain
now
quenched
the
fire
you
are
very
cruel
he
said
the
owner
of
arranstoun
was
very
cruel
he
knows
it
and
is
deeply
repentant
but
he
was
and
is
only
a
very
ordinary
man
no
a
savage
a
savage
then
if
you
will
and
one
dangerous
to
provoke
too
far
the
fire
blazed
again
and
what
do
you
suppose
your
friend
learned
in
those
five
years
of
men
after
she
had
ceased
to
exist
as
the
owner
of
arranstoun
knew
her
sabine
laughed
but
there
was
no
mirth
in
the
sound
of
men
that
they
are
like
children
desiring
only
the
toys
that
are
out
of
reach
wasting
their
souls
upon
what
they
can
not
obtain
and
valuing
not
at
all
the
gifts
of
the
gods
which
are
in
their
own
possession
what
a
cynical
view
is
it
not
a
true
one
perhaps
in
some
cases
in
mine
certainly
only
i
have
generally
managed
to
obtain
what
i
wanted
then
it
may
be
a
new
experience
for
you
to
find
there
was
one
thing
which
was
out
of
your
reach
he
bent
forward
eagerly
and
asked
with
a
catch
in
his
breath
and
that
was
the
soul
of
a
woman
shall
we
say
that
something
which
no
brute
force
can
touch
the
fencing
bout
was
over
the
foils
were
laid
aside
and
grim
earnest
was
in
michael
voice
now
modulated
by
civilization
into
that
tone
which
does
not
carry
beyond
one
neighbor
at
a
dinner
party
your
soul
sabine
that
is
the
only
thing
which
interests
me
and
i
was
never
able
to
touch
your
soul
that
is
not
true
as
you
know
how
dare
you
say
it
to
me
there
was
one
moment
hush
she
whispered
growing
very
white
you
must
not
you
shall
not
speak
to
me
so
you
had
no
right
to
come
here
no
right
to
talk
to
me
at
all
it
is
traitorous
we
are
both
traitors
to
lord
fordyce
who
is
a
noble
gentleman
above
suspecting
us
of
such
wiles
and
at
that
moment
through
a
gap
in
the
flowers
of
the
long
table
they
both
saw
henry
gray
eyes
fixed
upon
them
with
a
rather
questioning
surprise
and
then
forster
gave
the
signal
to
the
ladies
and
sabine
with
the
others
swept
from
the
room
leaving
michael
quivering
with
pain
and
emotion
as
for
sabine
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
during
dinner
moravia
had
had
an
interesting
conversation
with
henry
they
had
spoken
of
all
sorts
of
things
and
eventually
toward
the
end
of
it
of
sabine
she
is
the
strangest
character
lord
fordyce
moravia
said
she
is
more
like
a
boy
than
a
girl
in
some
ways
she
absolutely
rules
everyone
when
we
were
children
she
and
all
the
others
used
to
call
me
the
mother
in
our
games
but
it
was
really
sabine
who
settled
everything
she
was
always
the
brigand
captain
she
got
us
into
all
the
mischief
of
clandestine
feasts
and
other
rule
breaking
and
all
the
sisters
simply
adored
her
and
the
mother
superior
too
and
they
used
to
let
her
off
no
matter
what
she
did
with
not
half
our
punishments
she
was
the
wildest
madcap
you
ever
saw
henry
was
of
course
deeply
interested
she
is
sufficiently
grave
and
dignified
now
he
responded
in
admiration
his
worshiping
eyes
turned
in
sabine
direction
but
it
was
only
when
she
moved
in
a
certain
way
that
he
could
see
her
through
the
flowers
michael
he
saw
plainly
all
the
time
and
perceived
that
he
was
not
boring
himself
her
character
then
would
seem
to
have
been
rather
like
my
friend
michael
arranstoun
he
remarked
they
have
both
such
an
astonishing
penetrating
vitality
one
would
almost
know
when
either
of
them
was
in
the
room
even
if
one
could
not
see
them
he
is
awfully
and
attractive
your
friend
moravia
returned
i
have
never
seen
such
bold
blue
eyes
i
suppose
women
adore
him
i
personally
have
got
over
my
interest
in
that
sort
of
man
i
much
prefer
courteous
and
more
diffident
creatures
lord
fordyce
smiled
yes
i
believe
women
spoil
michael
terribly
and
he
is
perfectly
ruthless
with
them
too
but
i
understand
that
they
like
that
sort
of
thing
yes
most
of
them
do
it
is
the
simple
demonstration
of
strength
which
allures
them
you
see
man
was
meant
to
be
strong
and
moravia
laughed
softly
was
he
he
was
not
designed
in
the
scheme
of
things
to
be
a
soft
creature
like
cranley
beaton
for
instance
talking
gossip
and
handing
he
was
just
intended
to
be
a
fierce
great
hunter
rushing
round
killing
his
food
and
capturing
his
mate
and
women
have
remained
such
primitive
unspoiled
darlings
they
can
still
be
dominated
by
these
lovely
qualities
when
they
have
a
chance
to
see
them
but
alas
half
the
men
have
become
so
awfully
civilized
they
have
a
scrap
of
this
delightful
aboriginal
force
left
i
thought
you
said
you
personally
preferred
more
diffident
creatures
and
lord
fordyce
smiled
whimsically
so
i
do
now
i
said
i
had
got
over
my
interest
in
these
savages
but
of
course
i
liked
them
once
as
we
all
do
it
is
one
of
our
fatal
stages
that
we
have
to
pass
through
like
snakes
changing
their
skins
and
it
makes
many
of
us
during
the
time
lay
up
for
ourselves
all
sorts
of
regrets
henry
sought
eagerly
through
the
flowers
his
beloved
face
had
she
too
passed
through
this
stage
or
was
it
to
come
he
asked
himself
this
question
a
little
anxiously
and
then
he
remembered
the
words
of
père
anselme
and
an
unrest
grew
in
his
heart
the
princess
saw
that
some
shadow
had
gathered
upon
his
brow
and
guessed
since
she
knew
that
his
thoughts
in
general
turned
that
way
that
it
must
be
something
to
do
with
sabine
so
she
said
sabine
and
i
have
come
through
our
happinesses
i
trust
since
convent
days
and
what
we
must
hope
for
now
is
an
indian
summer
henry
turned
rather
wistful
eyes
to
her
an
indian
summer
he
exclaimed
a
peaceful
beautiful
warmth
after
the
riotous
joy
of
the
real
blazing
june
tell
me
about
it
moravia
sighed
softly
it
is
the
land
where
the
souls
who
have
gone
through
the
fire
of
pain
live
in
peace
and
quiet
happiness
content
to
glow
a
little
before
the
frosts
of
age
come
to
quench
all
passion
and
pleasure
henry
looked
down
at
the
grapes
on
his
plate
there
is
autumn
afterwards
he
reasoned
which
is
full
of
richness
and
glorious
fruit
may
we
not
look
forward
to
that
but
yet
i
know
that
we
all
deceive
ourselves
and
live
in
what
may
be
only
a
paradise
and
then
it
was
that
he
caught
sight
of
his
adored
as
she
bent
forward
after
her
rebuke
to
michael
and
with
a
burst
of
feeling
in
his
controlled
voice
he
cried
but
who
would
forego
his
paradise
and
then
he
took
in
the
fact
that
some
unusual
current
of
emotion
must
have
been
passing
between
the
two
and
his
heart
gave
a
great
bound
of
foreboding
for
the
keenness
of
his
perceptions
and
his
honesty
of
judgment
made
him
see
that
they
were
strangely
suited
to
one
another
his
darling
and
his
friend
so
strong
and
vital
and
young
chapter
xvii
the
ball
was
going
splendidly
and
everyone
seemed
to
be
in
wild
form
sabine
had
danced
with
an
excitement
in
her
veins
which
she
could
not
control
had
there
been
no
music
or
lights
she
might
just
have
felt
frightfully
disturbed
and
unhappy
but
as
it
was
she
was
only
conscious
of
excitement
lord
fordyce
was
above
showing
jealousy
and
was
content
that
she
seemed
to
be
enjoying
herself
and
did
not
appear
unwilling
to
return
to
him
quite
frequently
and
walk
about
the
room
or
sit
down
you
are
looking
so
supremely
bewitching
my
darling
he
told
her
i
feel
it
is
selfish
of
me
to
keep
you
away
from
the
gay
dances
you
are
so
young
and
sweet
i
want
you
to
enjoy
yourself
have
you
not
danced
with
michael
arranstoun
yet
i
saw
you
were
getting
on
with
him
splendidly
at
dinner
he
used
to
be
a
great
dancer
before
he
went
off
to
foreign
parts
no
i
have
not
spoken
to
him
even
she
answered
with
what
indifference
she
could
what
was
he
saying
just
before
you
left
the
which
made
you
look
so
haughty
dearest
he
was
not
impertinent
to
you
i
hope
and
henry
frowned
a
little
at
the
thought
sabine
played
with
her
fan
she
was
feeling
inexpressibly
mean
no
not
in
the
least
we
were
discussing
someone
we
had
both
known
long
ago
she
is
dead
now
i
may
have
been
a
little
annoyed
at
what
he
said
oh
is
that
a
scotch
reel
they
are
going
to
begin
how
glad
she
was
of
this
diversion
she
knew
she
had
been
capricious
with
lord
fordyce
once
or
twice
during
the
evening
she
was
greatly
perturbed
oh
why
had
she
not
had
the
courage
to
be
her
usual
honest
self
and
have
told
him
immediately
at
héronac
who
her
husband
really
was
she
was
in
a
false
position
ashamed
of
her
deceit
and
surrounded
by
a
of
acted
lies
and
all
through
everything
there
was
a
passionate
longing
to
speak
to
michael
again
and
to
be
near
him
once
more
as
at
dinner
she
had
been
conscious
of
everything
that
he
did
of
whom
he
had
danced
with
moravia
for
several
times
and
now
she
knew
that
he
was
not
in
the
nothing
could
exceed
henry
gentleness
and
goodness
to
her
he
watched
her
moods
and
put
up
with
her
caprices
that
something
unusual
had
disturbed
her
he
felt
but
what
it
could
be
he
was
unable
to
guess
sabine
was
aware
that
other
women
were
envying
her
for
the
attention
showered
upon
her
by
this
much
sought
after
man
she
tried
to
assure
herself
how
fortunate
she
was
and
now
got
henry
to
tell
her
once
more
of
things
about
his
home
it
was
in
the
fairest
part
of
kent
and
they
had
often
talked
of
the
wonderful
garden
they
would
have
in
that
fertile
country
sheltered
from
all
wind
and
she
knew
that
as
soon
as
the
divorce
was
over
she
and
moravia
would
go
and
stay
there
and
look
over
it
all
and
meet
his
mother
which
meeting
had
not
yet
been
arranged
for
some
unknown
reason
nothing
would
induce
her
to
go
now
i
would
rather
see
it
for
the
first
time
henry
when
i
am
engaged
to
you
now
i
should
be
an
ordinary
visitor
ca
you
understand
and
he
had
said
that
he
could
it
always
thrilled
him
when
she
appeared
to
take
an
interest
in
his
home
they
talked
now
about
it
and
how
he
would
so
love
her
to
choose
her
own
rooms
and
have
them
arranged
as
she
liked
then
he
made
pictures
of
their
life
together
there
and
as
he
spoke
her
heart
seemed
to
sink
and
become
heavier
every
moment
until
at
last
she
could
bear
no
more
it
was
about
two
dances
before
supper
into
which
she
had
promised
to
go
with
him
she
would
get
away
to
her
room
now
and
be
alone
until
then
she
must
pull
herself
together
and
act
with
common
sense
she
told
him
that
she
had
to
settle
her
hair
which
had
become
disarranged
and
saying
he
would
wait
for
her
he
left
her
at
the
foot
of
the
smaller
staircase
which
led
in
a
roundabout
way
to
her
and
moravia
rooms
she
had
not
wanted
to
pass
through
the
great
hall
where
quantities
of
people
were
sitting
out
she
was
just
crossing
the
corridor
where
the
bachelors
were
lodged
when
she
almost
ran
into
the
arms
of
michael
arranstoun
he
stopped
short
and
apologized
and
then
he
said
i
was
coming
to
find
you
there
is
something
i
must
say
to
you
forster
is
close
here
will
you
come
with
me
in
there
for
a
moment
we
can
be
alone
sabine
hesitated
she
looked
up
at
him
so
tall
and
masterful
and
astonishingly
handsome
and
then
she
obeyed
him
meekly
and
he
led
the
way
into
a
cosy
little
room
unlit
except
for
a
glowing
mass
of
coals
michael
turned
on
one
electric
lamp
and
they
both
went
over
to
the
chimney
piece
intense
excitement
and
emotion
filled
them
but
while
he
tried
to
search
her
face
with
his
passionate
eyes
she
looked
into
the
fire
with
lowered
head
then
he
spoke
almost
fiercely
i
can
not
try
to
guess
what
caused
you
to
pretend
you
did
not
recognize
me
when
we
met
at
héronac
that
first
false
step
has
created
all
this
hopeless
tangle
i
will
not
judge
you
but
only
blame
my
own
weakness
in
falling
in
with
your
plan
he
clasped
his
hands
together
rather
wildly
i
was
so
stunned
with
surprise
to
see
you
and
overcome
with
the
knowledge
that
i
had
just
given
henry
my
word
of
honor
that
i
would
not
interfere
with
him
or
make
love
to
the
lady
we
were
going
to
see
a
howard
who
was
married
to
a
ruffian
of
an
american
husband
shut
up
in
a
madhouse
or
home
for
inebriates
my
god
lies
from
the
very
beginning
and
he
gave
a
little
laugh
i
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
that
you
had
said
you
would
call
yourself
by
that
name
but
i
remembered
it
afterwards
you
had
not
decided
if
you
would
be
a
widow
do
you
recollect
and
you
wanted
a
coronet
for
your
handkerchiefs
and
sabine
quivered
under
the
lash
of
his
scorn
you
maddened
me
that
afternoon
and
at
dinner
too
he
went
on
and
i
made
resolutions
and
then
broke
them
but
each
time
i
did
i
was
filled
with
remorse
and
contrition
about
henry
and
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
it
i
was
madly
jealous
too
at
last
i
saw
you
in
the
garden
together
and
knew
i
ought
to
go
at
once
here
his
voice
broke
a
little
and
he
unclasped
his
hands
she
raised
her
head
defiantly
now
and
flashed
back
at
him
i
understand
you
had
admitted
to
being
a
dog
in
the
manger
you
were
always
an
animal
of
sorts
this
told
he
grew
paler
and
into
his
blue
eyes
there
came
a
look
of
pain
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
say
that
to
me
if
you
choose
it
is
probably
true
i
am
a
very
strong
man
with
tremendous
passions
which
have
always
been
in
my
race
but
i
am
not
altogether
a
brute
because
although
i
want
you
myself
with
more
intensity
than
i
have
ever
wanted
anything
in
my
life
i
am
going
to
give
you
up
to
henry
i
have
been
through
hell
ever
since
i
came
from
france
i
have
been
weak
too
and
could
not
face
the
final
wrench
but
i
am
determined
at
last
to
do
what
is
straight
and
i
will
instruct
my
lawyers
to
begin
proceedings
and
i
suppose
in
two
months
or
less
you
will
be
free
sabine
grew
white
and
cold
her
voice
was
hardly
audible
as
she
asked
looking
up
at
him
what
made
you
come
here
he
took
a
step
nearer
to
her
while
he
reclasped
his
hands
as
though
he
feared
that
he
might
be
tempted
to
touch
her
i
came
because
i
wanted
to
see
you
so
that
i
could
not
stay
away
i
came
because
i
wished
to
convince
myself
again
that
you
loved
henry
so
that
there
could
be
no
shadow
of
uncertainty
in
what
i
intended
to
do
well
i
saw
that
whether
you
love
him
or
not
you
desire
that
i
shall
think
that
you
do
and
so
at
dinner
i
played
for
my
own
pleasure
the
die
being
cast
for
something
else
had
occurred
before
dinner
which
makes
it
of
no
consequence
to
my
decision
whether
you
do
or
do
not
love
him
now
it
is
henry
great
love
for
you
which
is
the
factor
because
to
part
from
you
he
says
would
end
his
life
i
could
not
commit
the
frightful
cruelty
and
dishonor
of
upsetting
his
plans
since
you
are
originally
to
blame
for
concealing
the
truth
from
him
and
i
am
to
blame
for
abetting
you
he
trusts
us
both
as
you
said
sabine
was
trembling
her
whole
fabric
of
peace
and
happiness
in
the
future
seemed
to
be
falling
to
pieces
like
a
pack
of
cards
she
could
only
look
at
michael
with
piteous
violet
eyes
out
of
which
all
the
defiance
had
gone
her
slender
figure
swayed
a
little
and
she
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
my
god
he
said
with
a
fresh
clenching
of
his
strong
hands
i
would
not
have
believed
i
could
have
suffered
so
as
it
is
the
last
time
we
shall
ever
talk
to
one
another
perhaps
i
want
you
to
know
about
things
to
hear
it
all
i
would
like
to
ask
you
again
to
forgive
me
for
long
ago
but
i
suppose
you
feel
that
is
past
forgiveness
his
face
had
a
look
of
pleading
then
he
went
on
as
she
did
not
respond
if
you
had
not
left
me
i
would
soon
have
made
you
forget
that
you
had
been
angry
as
i
thought
indeed
i
had
already
done
when
you
seemed
to
be
contented
at
least
in
my
arms
but
i
would
have
caressed
you
into
complete
forgetfulness
in
time
here
his
voice
vibrated
with
a
deep
note
of
tenderness
which
thrilled
her
but
yet
she
could
not
speak
and
what
had
begun
just
in
mad
passion
would
have
grown
into
real
love
between
us
for
we
were
made
for
one
another
sabine
did
you
never
think
of
that
just
the
same
sort
of
natures
vigorous
and
all
alive
and
passionate
with
the
same
joy
of
life
in
our
blood
we
would
have
been
supremely
happy
but
i
was
so
frightfully
arrogant
in
those
days
and
when
i
spoke
i
was
deadly
ashamed
of
myself
and
then
furious
with
you
for
daring
to
defy
me
and
going
after
all
no
one
had
ever
disobeyed
me
but
it
was
shame
really
which
made
me
agree
to
join
latimer
berkeley
expedition
at
once
the
letter
came
by
the
early
post
i
wanted
to
get
right
away
and
try
to
forget
what
i
had
done
and
since
you
had
expressed
your
will
i
just
left
you
to
stand
by
it
he
leaned
upon
the
mantelpiece
now
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
oh
how
wrong
i
was
because
you
were
so
young
i
should
have
known
that
you
could
not
judge
and
perhaps
acted
hastily
in
that
sort
of
reaction
which
always
comes
to
one
after
passion
and
i
should
have
followed
you
and
brought
you
back
his
tones
shook
with
anguish
now
well
i
am
punished
and
so
all
that
is
left
for
us
to
do
is
to
say
my
dear
and
let
us
each
go
our
ways
you
at
least
are
not
suffering
as
i
am
because
you
do
not
care
a
little
sob
came
in
sabine
throat
and
she
could
not
reply
she
could
only
take
in
the
splendor
of
his
figure
and
his
grace
as
he
leaned
there
with
dark
bent
head
and
so
in
a
silence
that
seemed
to
throb
and
thrill
they
stood
near
together
for
a
few
moments
with
hearts
at
breaking
point
then
he
controlled
himself
he
must
go
at
once
or
he
could
no
longer
answer
for
what
he
might
do
she
looked
so
sweet
and
sorrowful
standing
close
to
his
side
her
violet
eyes
lowered
so
that
their
long
lashes
made
a
shadow
upon
her
dimpled
cheek
intense
magnetic
attraction
drew
them
nearer
and
nearer
sabine
he
cried
at
last
hoarsely
as
though
the
words
were
torn
from
his
tortured
heart
there
is
something
about
you
which
tells
me
that
you
do
not
love
henry
that
he
has
never
made
you
feel
as
i
once
made
you
feel
and
could
make
you
feel
again
he
stretched
out
his
arms
in
pain
the
temptation
is
frightful
terrible
just
to
kiss
you
once
more
darling
oh
i
can
not
bear
it
i
must
go
and
he
took
a
step
away
from
her
but
for
sabine
had
come
she
could
resist
its
force
no
more
every
nerve
in
her
whole
body
was
quivering
every
unknown
though
emotion
was
stirring
her
soul
her
whole
being
seemed
to
be
convulsed
in
one
concentrated
desire
the
reality
had
materialized
the
echoes
she
had
often
dimly
felt
from
that
night
of
long
ago
the
wild
passion
which
she
had
feared
and
only
that
very
evening
had
repudiated
as
being
an
impossible
experience
for
her
had
now
overtaken
her
and
she
could
struggle
no
more
michael
she
whispered
breathlessly
and
held
out
her
arms
with
a
cry
of
joy
he
clasped
her
to
him
in
a
fierce
ecstasy
all
the
feelings
in
both
their
souls
let
loose
at
last
it
was
a
moment
which
caused
time
and
place
and
all
other
things
to
be
forgotten
in
a
glory
as
great
as
though
eternity
had
come
my
darling
my
darling
he
murmured
kissing
her
hair
and
brow
and
eyelids
oh
the
hideous
cruelty
that
it
is
all
too
late
and
this
must
be
but
sabine
clung
to
him
half
sobbing
telling
him
she
could
not
bear
it
he
must
not
leave
her
now
and
so
they
stood
clasped
together
trembling
with
love
and
misery
darling
at
last
he
besought
her
while
he
unclasped
her
tender
hands
from
round
his
neck
darling
do
not
tempt
me
it
is
frightful
pain
but
i
must
keep
my
word
you
had
reason
once
to
think
that
i
was
an
uncontrollable
brute
but
you
shall
not
be
able
to
do
so
any
more
i
would
never
respect
myself
or
you
again
if
i
let
you
make
me
faithless
to
henry
now
it
is
cruel
sorrow
but
we
can
not
think
of
ourselves
you
know
we
used
too
lightly
for
our
own
ends
what
should
have
been
an
awfully
sacred
tie
do
you
remember
sabine
we
swore
to
god
to
love
and
be
faithful
forever
not
meaning
a
word
we
said
and
now
we
are
punished
a
great
sob
shook
his
deep
voice
darling
child
i
love
you
madly
madly
sabine
dear
little
one
but
you
and
i
are
just
driftwood
floating
down
the
tide
not
like
henry
who
is
a
splendid
fellow
of
great
use
to
england
it
is
impossible
that
his
whole
life
should
be
ruined
and
sacrificed
for
our
selfishness
darling
and
he
paused
and
drew
her
to
him
again
fondly
it
is
our
own
fault
we
have
let
the
situation
develop
through
indecision
and
i
expect
wounded
vanity
and
weakness
and
now
we
must
have
strength
to
abide
by
our
words
henry
is
young
like
we
are
you
see
i
honestly
believe
it
would
knock
him
right
out
if
anything
went
wrong
but
sabine
clung
to
him
still
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
that
she
loved
him
and
that
he
was
her
mate
and
her
husband
and
why
must
she
be
torn
from
his
side
for
the
happiness
of
any
other
man
she
was
in
an
agony
of
grief
and
then
suddenly
back
to
her
came
the
words
of
père
anselme
heavy
as
the
stroke
of
doom
yes
she
had
taken
matters
into
her
own
hands
and
presumed
to
direct
fate
and
now
all
that
she
could
do
was
to
be
true
to
herself
and
to
her
word
michael
was
right
they
must
say
henry
must
not
be
sacrificed
she
raised
her
pitiful
face
from
his
breast
where
it
was
buried
and
he
framed
it
in
both
his
hands
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
recognize
his
bold
eyes
so
filled
were
they
with
tenderness
and
love
sabine
he
commanded
fondly
tell
me
that
after
all
you
have
forgiven
me
for
making
you
stay
that
night
you
know
that
we
were
perfectly
happy
at
the
end
of
it
and
it
will
be
such
pain
for
me
to
have
to
remember
all
the
rest
of
my
life
that
you
hold
resentment
darling
if
only
you
had
stayed
oh
i
would
have
cherished
you
and
petted
you
here
he
smoothed
her
hair
and
murmured
love
words
in
her
ear
with
his
wonderful
charm
until
sabine
felt
that
neither
heaven
nor
earth
nor
anything
else
mattered
but
only
he
sweetheart
he
went
on
we
have
got
to
part
in
a
moment
but
i
just
must
know
if
you
love
me
a
little
in
spite
of
everything
i
my
darling
little
girl
then
he
held
her
to
him
again
with
immense
tenderness
even
in
this
moment
of
agonized
parting
exulting
in
the
intoxication
of
love
he
saw
that
he
had
created
in
her
eyes
there
was
no
wile
for
the
enslaving
of
a
woman
heart
that
he
was
not
master
of
the
question
as
to
whether
he
ought
to
have
employed
them
on
this
occasion
is
quite
another
matter
and
not
for
our
consideration
he
was
doing
what
he
thought
was
the
only
honorable
thing
possible
giving
up
this
glorious
happiness
and
he
was
merely
a
strong
passionate
human
being
after
all
they
were
going
to
part
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
he
must
make
her
tell
him
that
she
loved
him
he
wanted
to
hear
her
say
the
words
sabine
little
darling
answer
me
he
pleaded
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
her
whole
body
vibrating
with
emotion
i
love
you
absolutely
michael
she
cried
and
i
have
always
forgiven
you
i
was
mad
to
leave
you
and
i
have
longed
often
to
go
back
oh
i
would
sooner
be
dead
than
not
to
be
your
wife
they
both
were
white
now
the
misery
was
so
great
he
knew
he
must
go
at
once
or
he
could
never
go
at
all
they
were
too
racked
with
present
suffering
to
think
what
the
future
could
contain
or
of
the
growing
agony
of
the
long
weary
days
and
how
they
could
ever
bear
them
my
god
this
is
past
endurance
michael
exclaimed
frantically
and
after
a
wild
embrace
he
almost
flung
her
from
him
then
as
she
staggered
to
a
sofa
she
heard
the
door
close
and
knew
that
chapter
of
her
life
was
done
she
sat
there
for
a
while
gazing
into
the
fire
too
stunned
with
misery
even
to
think
but
presently
everything
came
to
her
with
merciless
clearness
how
small
she
had
been
all
along
instead
of
waiting
until
she
heard
the
truth
she
had
let
a
wretched
paragraph
in
a
newspaper
inflame
her
wounded
vanity
so
that
she
gave
her
promise
to
henry
there
and
then
putting
the
rope
round
her
neck
with
her
own
hands
and
afterwards
instead
of
being
brave
and
true
wounded
vanity
again
had
caused
her
to
tighten
the
knot
she
remembered
henry
words
when
he
had
implored
her
to
tell
him
what
were
the
actual
wishes
of
her
heart
and
how
she
had
cut
off
all
retreat
by
her
answer
she
remembered
all
his
goodness
to
her
and
how
she
had
accepted
it
as
her
due
making
him
care
for
her
more
and
more
as
each
day
came
i
have
been
a
hopeless
coward
she
moaned
a
paltry
vain
hopeless
coward
i
should
have
owned
michael
was
my
husband
immediately
henry
could
have
got
over
it
then
and
now
we
might
be
happy
but
it
is
too
late
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
then
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sobbed
brokenly
oh
my
love
my
love
and
i
did
not
even
now
tell
you
all
the
clock
struck
one
supper
would
be
beginning
and
she
must
go
down
if
michael
could
bear
this
agony
and
behave
like
a
gentleman
she
also
must
play
her
part
with
dignity
henry
would
be
waiting
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
she
went
rapidly
to
her
room
and
removed
all
traces
of
emotion
and
then
she
returned
to
the
hall
by
the
way
she
had
come
i
was
growing
quite
anxious
dearest
lord
fordyce
told
her
as
he
advanced
to
meet
her
when
she
came
down
the
stairs
i
feared
you
were
ill
and
was
just
coming
to
find
you
let
us
go
straight
in
to
supper
now
you
look
rather
pale
i
must
take
care
of
you
and
give
you
some
champagne
and
he
placed
her
hand
in
his
arm
fondly
and
led
her
along
illustration
is
often
in
some
scrape
something
must
have
culminated
they
found
chairs
which
had
been
kept
for
them
at
a
centre
table
near
their
hostess
and
moravia
and
here
they
sat
down
michael
was
nowhere
in
sight
but
presently
he
came
in
with
one
of
the
and
forster
beckoned
them
to
her
and
thus
it
happened
that
he
was
again
at
sabine
side
his
eyes
had
a
reckless
stony
stare
in
them
and
he
confined
his
conversation
to
the
lady
he
had
taken
in
and
henry
who
was
watching
him
whispered
to
sabine
he
is
often
in
some
scrape
michael
something
must
have
culminated
i
have
never
seen
him
looking
so
haggard
and
pale
sabine
drank
down
her
glass
of
champagne
she
thought
she
could
no
longer
support
the
situation
she
almost
felt
she
hated
henry
and
his
devotion
it
was
paralyzing
her
suffocating
her
crushing
her
life
michael
never
spoke
to
her
beyond
a
casual
word
and
at
length
they
all
went
back
to
the
where
an
extra
was
being
played
michael
for
a
moment
standing
by
her
side
then
a
sudden
madness
came
to
them
as
their
eyes
met
and
he
held
out
his
arm
this
is
my
dance
i
think
howard
he
said
with
careless
sangfroid
and
he
whirled
her
away
into
the
middle
of
the
room
they
both
were
perfect
dancers
and
never
stopped
in
their
wild
career
until
the
music
ended
it
was
a
and
all
the
young
people
clapped
for
the
band
to
go
on
so
once
more
they
started
with
the
throng
they
had
not
spoken
a
single
word
it
was
a
strange
comfort
to
them
just
to
be
together
half
anguish
half
bliss
but
as
the
last
bars
died
away
michael
whispered
in
her
ear
i
am
going
to
say
to
rose
she
is
accustomed
to
my
ways
i
have
ordered
my
motor
and
i
am
going
home
i
can
not
bear
it
another
single
minute
if
i
stayed
until
i
should
break
my
word
i
love
you
to
absolute
distraction
and
without
waiting
for
her
to
answer
he
left
her
close
to
henry
and
turning
was
lost
in
the
crowd
suddenly
the
whole
room
reeled
to
sabine
the
lights
danced
in
her
eyes
and
a
rushing
sound
came
in
her
ears
she
would
have
fallen
forward
only
lord
fordyce
caught
her
arm
while
he
cried
in
solicitous
consternation
my
dearest
you
have
danced
too
much
you
feel
faint
let
me
take
you
out
of
all
this
into
the
cool
but
sabine
pulled
herself
together
and
assured
him
she
was
all
right
she
had
been
giddy
for
a
moment
he
need
not
distress
himself
and
as
they
walked
into
the
conservatory
she
protested
vehemently
that
she
had
never
been
at
so
delightful
a
ball
chapter
xviii
a
sobbing
wind
and
a
weeping
rain
beat
round
the
walls
of
arranstoun
and
the
great
gray
turrets
and
towers
made
a
grim
picture
against
the
november
sky
darkening
toward
late
afternoon
as
its
master
came
through
the
postern
gate
and
across
the
lawn
to
his
private
rooms
he
had
been
tramping
the
moorland
beyond
the
park
without
binko
or
a
gun
his
thoughts
too
tempestuous
to
bear
with
even
them
for
the
letter
to
mcdonald
and
malden
had
gone
and
the
first
act
of
the
tragedy
of
his
freedom
had
been
begun
it
was
a
colossal
price
to
pay
for
honor
and
friendship
but
while
they
had
been
brigands
and
robbers
for
hundreds
of
years
the
arranstouns
had
not
been
dishonorable
men
and
had
once
or
twice
in
their
history
done
a
great
and
generous
thing
michael
was
not
of
the
character
which
lauded
itself
indeed
he
was
never
introspective
nor
thought
of
himself
at
all
he
was
just
strong
and
living
and
breathing
his
actions
governed
by
an
inherited
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
for
a
gentleman
code
which
unless
it
was
swamped
as
on
one
occasion
it
had
been
by
violent
passion
very
seldom
led
him
wrong
now
he
determined
never
to
look
ahead
or
picture
the
blankness
of
his
days
as
they
must
become
with
no
hope
of
ever
seeing
sabine
he
supposed
vaguely
that
the
pain
would
grow
less
in
time
he
should
have
to
play
a
lot
of
games
and
take
tremendous
interest
in
his
tenants
and
his
property
and
perhaps
presently
go
into
parliament
and
if
all
that
failed
he
could
make
some
expedition
into
the
wilds
again
he
was
too
healthy
and
to
have
even
in
this
moment
of
deep
suffering
any
morbid
ideas
when
he
had
changed
his
soaking
garments
he
came
back
into
his
and
pulled
binko
upon
his
knees
the
dog
and
his
fat
wrinkles
seemed
some
kind
of
comfort
to
him
she
remembered
you
binko
old
man
he
said
caressing
the
ears
she
is
the
sweetest
little
darling
in
all
the
world
you
would
have
loved
her
soft
brown
hair
and
her
round
dimpled
cheek
and
she
loves
your
master
binko
just
as
he
loves
her
she
has
forgiven
him
for
everything
of
long
ago
and
if
she
could
she
would
come
back
here
and
live
with
us
and
make
us
divinely
happy
as
we
believed
she
was
going
to
do
once
when
we
were
young
and
then
he
thought
suddenly
of
henry
home
the
stately
elizabethan
house
amidst
luxuriant
peaceful
scenery
not
grim
and
strong
like
arranstoun
though
she
preferred
gaunt
castles
evidently
since
she
had
bought
héronac
for
her
own
but
the
thought
of
henry
home
and
her
adorning
it
brought
too
intimate
pictures
to
his
imagination
they
galled
him
so
that
at
last
he
could
not
bear
it
and
started
to
his
feet
it
was
possible
to
part
from
her
and
go
away
but
it
was
not
possible
to
contemplate
calmly
the
fact
of
her
being
the
wife
of
another
man
material
things
came
always
more
vividly
to
michael
than
spiritual
ones
and
the
vision
he
had
conjured
up
was
one
of
sabine
encircled
by
arms
this
was
unbearable
and
before
he
was
aware
of
it
he
found
he
was
clenching
his
fists
in
rage
and
that
binko
was
sitting
on
his
haunches
blinking
at
him
with
his
head
on
one
side
in
his
endeavors
to
understand
michael
pulled
himself
together
and
laughed
bitterly
aloud
i
must
just
never
think
of
it
old
man
he
told
the
dog
or
i
shall
go
mad
then
he
sat
down
again
with
what
poignant
regret
he
looked
back
upon
his
original
going
to
china
if
only
he
had
stayed
and
gone
after
her
that
next
day
and
seized
her
again
and
brought
her
back
here
to
this
room
they
would
have
had
five
years
of
happiness
she
was
sweeter
now
far
than
she
had
been
then
and
he
could
have
watched
her
developing
instead
of
her
coming
to
perfection
all
alone
that
under
these
circumstances
she
might
never
have
acquired
that
polish
of
mind
and
strange
dignity
and
reserve
of
manner
which
was
one
of
her
greatest
attractions
did
not
strike
him
as
it
has
been
plainly
said
he
was
not
given
to
analysis
in
his
judgment
of
things
i
wish
she
had
had
a
baby
binko
he
remarked
when
once
more
seated
in
his
chair
then
she
would
have
been
obliged
to
return
at
once
of
her
own
accord
binko
grunted
and
slobbered
his
acquiescence
and
sympathy
with
his
wise
old
fat
head
poked
into
his
master
arm
you
are
trying
to
tell
me
that
as
i
had
gone
off
to
china
she
have
done
that
in
any
case
you
old
scoundrel
and
of
course
you
are
right
but
she
did
not
try
to
you
know
there
was
no
letter
from
her
among
the
hundreds
which
were
waiting
for
me
at
hong
kong
or
here
when
i
got
back
she
could
have
sent
me
a
cable
and
i
would
have
returned
like
a
shot
from
anywhere
but
she
did
not
want
me
then
she
wanted
to
be
free
and
now
when
she
does
her
hands
are
already
tied
the
whole
cursed
thing
is
her
own
fault
and
that
is
what
is
the
biggest
pain
old
dog
then
his
thoughts
wandered
back
to
their
scene
in
rose
that
was
pleasure
indeed
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
big
chair
and
let
himself
dream
he
could
hear
her
words
telling
him
that
she
loved
him
and
could
feel
her
soft
lips
pressed
in
passion
to
his
own
my
god
i
ca
bear
it
he
cried
at
last
once
more
clenching
his
hands
and
so
it
went
on
through
days
and
nights
of
anguish
the
aspects
of
the
case
repeating
themselves
in
endless
persistence
until
with
all
his
will
and
his
strong
health
and
love
of
sport
and
vigorous
work
the
agony
of
desire
for
sabine
grew
into
an
obsession
whatever
sins
he
had
committed
in
his
life
indeed
his
punishment
had
come
sabine
for
her
part
found
the
days
not
worth
living
nothing
in
life
or
nature
stays
at
a
standstill
if
stagnation
sets
in
then
death
comes
and
so
it
was
that
her
emotions
for
michael
did
not
remain
the
same
but
grew
and
augmented
more
and
more
as
the
certainty
that
they
were
parted
for
ever
forced
itself
upon
her
brain
they
had
not
been
back
in
london
a
day
when
parsons
announced
to
her
that
at
last
all
was
going
well
arranstoun
had
put
the
matter
in
train
and
soon
she
would
be
free
and
shrewd
american
that
he
was
he
wondered
why
she
should
get
so
pale
the
news
did
not
appear
to
be
such
a
very
great
pleasure
to
her
after
all
her
greatest
concern
seemed
to
be
that
he
should
arrange
that
there
should
be
no
notice
of
anything
in
the
papers
i
particularly
do
not
wish
lord
fordyce
ever
to
know
that
my
name
was
arranstoun
she
said
i
will
pay
anything
if
it
is
necessary
to
stop
reports
and
if
such
things
are
possible
to
do
in
this
country
but
parsons
could
hold
out
no
really
encouraging
hopes
of
this
no
details
would
probably
be
known
but
that
michael
arranstoun
had
married
a
sabine
delburg
and
now
divorced
her
would
certainly
be
announced
in
the
scotch
journals
where
the
arranstouns
and
their
castle
were
of
such
interest
to
the
public
if
only
i
had
been
called
mary
smith
sabine
almost
moaned
if
lord
fordyce
sees
this
he
must
realize
that
although
he
knows
me
as
sabine
howard
i
was
probably
sabine
delburg
i
should
think
you
had
better
inform
his
lordship
yourself
at
once
there
is
no
disgrace
in
the
matter
arranstoun
is
a
very
splendid
name
parsons
ventured
to
remind
her
but
sabine
shut
her
firm
mouth
not
until
it
became
absolutely
necessary
would
she
do
this
thing
henry
company
now
had
no
longer
power
to
soothe
her
she
found
herself
crushing
down
sudden
inclinations
to
be
capricious
to
him
or
even
unkind
and
then
she
would
feel
full
of
remorse
and
regret
when
she
saw
the
pain
in
his
fond
eyes
she
was
thankful
that
they
were
returning
to
paris
and
then
she
meant
to
go
straight
to
héronac
telling
him
he
must
see
her
no
more
until
she
was
free
it
was
the
month
of
the
greatest
storms
there
it
would
suit
her
exactly
and
it
was
her
very
own
she
need
not
act
for
only
madame
imogen
and
père
anselme
but
when
she
thought
of
this
latter
a
sensation
of
discomfort
came
how
could
she
read
in
peace
with
the
dear
old
man
who
was
so
keen
and
so
subtle
he
would
certainly
divine
that
all
was
not
well
and
ever
his
sentence
recurred
to
her
remember
always
my
daughter
that
bon
settles
things
for
us
mortals
if
we
leave
it
all
to
him
but
if
we
take
the
helm
in
the
direction
of
our
own
affairs
it
may
be
that
he
will
let
circumstance
draw
us
into
rough
waters
and
then
that
as
she
had
taken
the
helm
she
must
abide
by
her
word
bitterness
and
regret
were
her
portion
in
a
far
greater
degree
than
after
that
other
crisis
of
her
life
when
its
realities
had
come
to
her
and
she
knew
she
must
bear
them
alone
she
had
been
too
young
then
to
understand
half
the
possibilities
of
mental
pain
and
also
there
was
no
finality
about
anything
all
might
develop
into
sunshine
again
now
she
had
the
most
cruel
torture
of
all
the
knowledge
that
she
herself
by
her
wilfulness
and
pride
had
pulled
down
the
blinds
and
brought
herself
into
darkness
and
that
there
was
not
anything
to
be
done
nothing
could
have
been
more
unhappy
than
was
the
state
of
these
two
young
people
in
their
separate
homes
in
the
old
days
when
she
used
to
try
and
banish
the
too
lenient
thoughts
of
michael
she
had
always
the
picture
of
his
selfishness
and
violent
passion
to
call
up
to
her
aid
but
that
was
blotted
out
now
and
in
its
place
there
was
the
memory
that
it
was
he
not
she
who
had
behaved
nobly
and
decided
to
sacrifice
all
happiness
to
be
true
to
his
friend
sometimes
when
she
first
got
back
to
héronac
she
too
allowed
herself
to
dream
of
their
and
the
cruel
sweetness
of
that
brief
moment
of
bliss
and
she
would
go
through
strange
thrills
and
quivers
and
stretch
out
her
arms
in
the
firelight
and
whisper
his
name
aloud
michael
my
dear
love
she
could
not
even
bear
the
watching
affectionate
eyes
of
madame
imogen
and
sent
her
to
paris
on
a
month
holiday
the
père
anselme
had
been
away
when
she
arrived
at
the
deathbed
of
an
old
sister
at
versailles
so
she
was
utterly
alone
in
her
grim
castle
with
only
the
waves
the
once
letters
from
henry
were
a
dreaded
tie
now
she
would
have
to
answer
them
and
as
his
grew
more
tender
and
loving
so
hers
unconsciously
became
more
cold
with
a
note
of
bitterness
in
them
sometimes
of
which
she
was
unaware
and
henry
in
paris
with
moravia
wondered
and
grieved
and
grew
sick
at
heart
as
the
days
went
on
he
had
let
his
political
ambitions
slide
and
lingered
there
as
being
nearer
his
adored
one
instead
of
going
home
now
love
was
playing
his
sad
pranks
with
all
of
them
and
the
princess
torniloni
was
receiving
her
share
the
constant
companionship
of
henry
had
not
made
her
feelings
more
calm
she
was
really
in
love
with
him
with
all
that
was
best
and
greatest
in
her
sweet
nature
and
it
was
changing
her
every
idea
she
was
even
getting
a
little
vicarious
happiness
out
of
being
a
sympathetic
friend
and
as
he
grew
sad
and
restless
so
she
became
more
gentle
and
tender
and
watched
over
him
like
a
fond
mother
with
a
child
she
would
not
look
ahead
or
face
the
fact
that
he
had
grown
too
dear
she
was
living
her
indian
summer
she
told
herself
and
would
not
see
its
end
how
awfully
good
you
are
to
me
princess
he
told
her
one
afternoon
as
they
walked
together
in
the
bright
frosty
air
about
a
week
after
sabine
had
left
them
i
never
have
known
so
kind
a
woman
you
seem
to
think
of
gentle
and
sympathetic
things
to
say
before
one
even
asks
for
your
sympathy
how
greatly
i
misjudged
your
nation
before
i
knew
you
and
sabine
no
i
do
think
you
did
misjudge
us
in
general
she
replied
lots
of
us
are
horrid
when
we
are
on
the
make
and
those
are
the
sorts
you
generally
meet
in
england
we
would
not
go
there
you
see
if
it
was
not
to
get
something
we
can
have
everything
material
as
good
if
not
better
in
our
own
country
only
we
ca
get
your
repose
or
your
atmosphere
and
we
are
growing
so
much
cleverer
and
richer
every
year
that
we
hate
to
think
there
is
something
we
ca
buy
and
so
we
come
over
to
england
and
set
to
work
to
grab
it
from
you
how
delightful
you
are
i
am
only
echoing
sabine
who
has
all
the
quaint
ideas
in
that
pretty
young
baby
head
she
thinks
out
evolution
and
cause
and
effect
and
heredity
and
every
sort
of
deep
tiresome
thing
have
you
heard
from
her
princess
henry
voice
was
a
little
anxious
she
had
not
written
to
him
yes
she
seems
to
be
in
rather
a
queer
mood
what
has
caused
it
do
you
know
dear
friend
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea
it
has
puzzled
me
too
and
voice
was
perplexed
ever
since
the
ball
at
your
sister
she
has
been
changed
in
some
way
had
you
any
quarrel
or
jar
or
difference
of
opinion
do
think
i
am
asking
from
curiosity
i
am
really
concerned
henry
distinguished
face
grew
it
cut
like
a
knife
to
have
his
vague
unadmitted
fears
put
into
words
we
had
no
discussions
of
any
kind
she
was
particularly
sweet
and
spent
nearly
the
whole
evening
with
me
as
you
know
is
it
something
about
her
husband
do
you
think
which
is
troubling
her
but
it
can
not
be
that
because
in
her
letter
of
two
days
ago
she
said
the
proceedings
had
been
started
and
she
would
be
free
perhaps
by
christmastime
as
all
was
being
hurried
through
moravia
gave
an
exclamation
of
surprise
sabine
is
certainly
very
strange
can
you
believe
it
she
has
never
mentioned
the
matter
to
me
since
we
returned
and
once
when
i
spoke
of
it
she
put
the
subject
aside
she
did
not
to
remember
it
she
said
it
is
evidently
that
then
and
we
must
have
patience
with
the
dear
little
girl
the
husband
must
have
been
an
unmitigated
wretch
to
have
left
such
a
deep
scar
upon
her
life
but
she
never
saw
him
from
the
day
after
she
was
married
moravia
exclaimed
and
then
pulled
herself
up
short
glancing
at
henry
furtively
what
had
sabine
told
him
probably
no
more
than
she
had
told
her
she
felt
the
subject
was
dangerous
ground
and
it
would
be
wiser
to
avoid
further
discussion
upon
the
matter
so
she
remarked
casually
no
after
all
i
do
not
believe
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
husband
it
is
just
a
mood
she
has
always
had
moods
for
years
i
know
she
is
looking
forward
awfully
to
our
all
going
to
her
for
christmas
then
you
will
be
able
to
clear
away
all
your
clouds
but
this
conversation
left
henry
very
troubled
and
père
anselme
words
about
the
cinders
still
being
red
kept
recurring
to
him
with
increasing
pain
sabine
had
been
at
héronac
for
ten
days
when
the
old
priest
got
back
to
his
flock
it
was
toward
the
end
of
november
and
the
weather
was
one
raging
storm
of
rain
and
wind
the
surf
boiled
round
the
base
of
the
castle
and
the
waves
rose
as
giant
foes
ready
to
attack
it
comforted
the
mistress
of
it
to
stand
upon
the
causeway
bridge
and
get
soaking
wet
or
to
sit
in
one
of
the
mullioned
windows
of
her
great
and
watch
the
angry
water
thundering
beneath
and
here
the
père
anselme
found
her
on
the
morning
after
his
return
she
rose
quickly
in
gladness
to
meet
him
and
they
sat
down
together
again
she
spoke
her
sympathy
for
this
bereavement
which
had
caused
his
absence
but
he
said
with
grave
peace
she
is
well
my
sister
a
martyr
in
life
she
has
paid
her
debt
i
have
no
grief
so
they
talked
about
the
garden
and
of
the
and
their
winter
needs
there
had
been
a
wreck
of
a
fishing
boat
and
a
wife
and
children
would
be
hungry
but
for
the
kindness
of
their
dame
then
there
was
a
pause
not
one
of
those
calm
happy
pauses
of
other
days
when
each
one
dreamed
but
a
pause
wrought
with
unease
the
old
black
eyes
had
a
questioning
expression
and
then
he
asked
and
what
is
it
my
daughter
your
heart
is
not
at
rest
but
sabine
could
not
answer
him
her
anguish
won
the
day
and
as
once
before
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
the
père
anselme
did
not
seek
to
comfort
her
he
knew
women
well
she
would
be
calmer
presently
and
would
tell
him
what
her
sorrow
was
he
only
murmured
some
words
in
latin
and
looked
out
on
the
sea
presently
the
sobs
ceased
and
the
dame
rose
quickly
and
left
the
room
and
when
she
had
mastered
her
emotion
she
came
back
again
my
father
she
said
sitting
on
a
low
stool
at
his
knees
i
have
been
very
foolish
and
very
wicked
but
i
can
not
talk
about
it
let
us
begin
to
read
chapter
xix
meanwhile
the
divorce
affair
went
on
apace
there
was
no
defence
of
course
and
michael
lawyers
were
clever
and
his
own
influence
was
great
so
freedom
would
come
before
the
end
of
term
probably
if
not
early
in
the
new
year
and
henry
felt
he
might
begin
to
ask
his
beloved
one
to
name
a
date
when
he
could
call
her
his
own
and
endeavor
to
take
every
shadow
from
her
life
his
letters
all
this
month
had
been
more
than
extra
tender
and
devoted
each
one
showing
that
his
whole
desire
was
only
for
sabine
welfare
and
each
one
as
she
read
it
put
a
fresh
stab
into
her
heart
and
seemed
like
an
extra
fetter
in
the
chain
binding
her
to
him
she
knew
she
was
really
the
mainspring
of
his
life
and
she
could
not
did
not
dare
to
face
what
might
be
the
consequence
of
her
parting
from
him
besides
the
die
was
cast
and
she
must
have
the
courage
to
go
through
with
it
parsons
had
let
her
know
definitely
that
the
bare
fact
of
her
name
would
appear
in
the
papers
and
nothing
more
and
at
first
the
thought
came
to
her
that
if
it
had
made
no
impression
upon
henry
memory
when
he
must
have
read
it
originally
in
the
notice
of
the
marriage
why
should
it
strike
him
now
but
this
was
too
slender
a
thread
to
hang
hope
upon
and
it
would
be
wiser
and
better
for
them
all
if
when
lord
fordyce
came
with
moravia
and
girolamo
and
cloudwater
at
christmas
she
told
him
the
whole
truth
the
dread
of
this
augmented
day
by
day
until
it
became
a
nightmare
and
she
had
to
use
the
whole
force
of
her
will
to
keep
even
an
outward
semblance
of
calm
thoughts
of
michael
she
dismissed
as
well
as
she
could
but
she
had
passionate
longings
to
go
and
take
out
the
blue
enamel
locket
from
her
and
look
at
it
once
more
she
would
not
permit
herself
to
indulge
in
this
weakness
though
her
whole
days
were
ruled
with
sternest
discipline
until
she
became
quite
thin
and
the
père
anselme
grew
worried
about
her
a
fortnight
went
by
it
was
growing
near
to
christmastime
but
the
atmosphere
of
héronac
contained
no
peace
and
one
bleak
afternoon
the
old
priest
paced
the
long
walk
in
the
garden
with
knitted
brows
he
did
not
feel
altogether
sure
as
to
what
was
his
duty
he
was
always
on
the
side
of
leaving
things
in
the
hand
of
the
good
god
but
it
might
be
that
he
would
be
selected
to
be
an
instrument
of
fate
since
he
seemed
the
only
detached
person
with
any
authority
in
the
affair
his
dame
had
tried
hard
to
be
natural
and
her
old
self
he
could
see
that
but
her
taste
in
their
reading
had
been
over
much
directed
to
heine
she
having
brought
french
translations
of
this
works
back
with
her
from
paris
twice
also
had
she
asked
him
to
recite
to
her
de
musset
nuit
de
he
did
not
consider
these
as
satisfactory
symptoms
there
was
no
question
in
his
astute
mind
as
to
what
was
the
general
cause
of
his
beloved
lady
unrest
the
change
in
her
had
begun
to
take
place
ever
since
the
fatal
visit
of
the
two
englishmen
herein
lay
matter
for
thought
for
the
very
morning
before
their
arrival
she
had
been
particularly
bright
and
gay
telling
him
of
her
intended
action
in
making
arrangements
to
free
herself
from
her
empty
marriage
bonds
and
apparently
contemplating
a
new
life
with
lord
fordyce
with
satisfaction
père
anselme
was
a
great
student
of
voltaire
and
looked
upon
his
tale
of
zadig
as
one
from
which
much
benefit
could
be
derived
and
now
he
began
to
put
the
method
of
this
citizen
of
babylon
into
practice
never
having
heard
of
the
immortal
sherlock
holmes
the
end
of
his
cogitations
directed
upon
this
principle
brought
him
two
concrete
facts
number
one
that
sabine
had
been
deeply
affected
by
the
presence
of
the
second
englishman
the
handsome
and
vital
young
man
and
number
two
that
she
was
now
certainly
regretting
that
she
was
going
to
obtain
her
divorce
further
use
of
zadig
deductive
method
produced
the
conviction
that
as
an
abstract
young
man
would
be
equally
out
of
reach
were
she
still
bound
to
her
husband
or
married
to
lord
fordyce
and
could
only
be
obtained
were
she
divorced
some
other
reason
for
her
distaste
and
evident
depression
about
this
latter
state
coming
to
her
must
be
looked
for
and
could
only
be
found
in
the
supposition
that
the
seigneur
of
arranstoun
might
be
himself
her
husband
why
then
this
mystery
why
had
not
he
and
she
told
the
truth
zadig
counsel
could
not
help
him
to
unravel
this
point
and
he
continued
to
pace
the
walk
with
impatient
sighs
he
was
even
more
of
a
gentleman
than
of
a
priest
and
therefore
forbore
to
question
sabine
directly
but
that
afternoon
with
the
intention
of
directing
her
mind
into
facing
eventualities
he
had
talked
of
lord
fordyce
and
what
would
be
the
duties
of
her
future
position
as
his
wife
sabine
replied
without
enthusiasm
in
her
tones
while
her
words
gave
a
picture
of
all
that
any
woman
heart
could
desire
he
is
a
very
fine
character
it
would
seem
the
père
anselme
said
and
he
loves
you
with
a
deep
devotion
sabine
clasped
her
hands
suddenly
as
though
the
thought
gave
her
physical
pain
he
loves
me
too
much
father
no
woman
should
be
loved
like
that
it
fills
her
with
fear
fear
of
what
fear
of
failing
to
come
up
to
the
standard
of
his
ideal
of
her
fear
of
breaking
his
heart
i
told
him
in
the
beginning
it
were
wiser
to
be
certain
all
cinders
were
cold
before
embarking
upon
fresh
ties
père
anselme
remarked
meditatively
and
he
assured
me
that
he
would
ascertain
facts
and
whether
or
no
you
felt
he
could
make
you
happy
and
he
did
sabine
voice
was
strained
and
i
told
him
that
he
could
if
he
would
help
me
to
forget
and
i
gave
him
my
word
and
let
him
kiss
me
father
so
i
am
bound
to
him
irrevocably
as
you
can
see
it
would
seem
so
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
priest
got
up
and
held
his
thin
brown
hands
to
the
blaze
his
eyes
averted
from
her
while
he
spoke
you
must
look
to
the
end
my
daughter
and
ask
yourself
whether
or
no
you
will
be
strong
enough
to
play
your
part
in
the
years
which
are
coming
since
from
what
i
can
judge
the
embers
are
not
yet
cold
temptation
will
arm
for
you
with
increasing
strength
what
then
i
do
not
know
sabine
whispered
hardly
aloud
it
will
be
necessary
to
be
quite
sure
my
daughter
before
you
again
make
vows
and
then
he
turned
the
conversation
abruptly
which
was
his
way
when
he
intended
what
he
had
said
to
sink
deeply
into
the
heart
of
his
listener
but
just
as
he
was
leaving
after
tea
he
drew
the
heavy
curtains
back
from
one
of
the
great
windows
all
was
inky
darkness
and
the
roaring
of
the
sea
with
its
breakers
foaming
beneath
them
came
up
like
the
menacing
voices
of
an
angry
crowd
the
good
god
can
calm
even
this
rough
water
he
said
it
would
be
well
that
you
ask
for
guidance
my
child
and
when
it
has
come
to
you
hesitate
no
more
then
making
his
sign
of
blessing
he
rapidly
strode
to
the
door
leaving
the
dame
crouched
upon
the
velvet
peering
out
upon
the
waves
and
michael
numb
with
misery
and
regret
was
deciding
to
go
to
paris
for
christmas
the
memories
at
arranstoun
he
could
not
endure
the
great
suffering
that
he
was
going
through
was
having
some
effect
upon
his
mind
refining
him
in
all
ways
forcing
him
to
think
and
to
reason
out
all
problems
of
life
the
great
dreams
which
used
to
come
to
him
sometimes
when
in
kashmire
during
solitary
hours
of
watching
for
sport
returned
he
would
surely
do
something
vast
with
his
life
when
this
awful
pain
should
be
past
what
he
could
not
decide
but
something
which
would
take
him
out
of
himself
he
did
not
think
he
could
stay
in
england
just
at
first
after
sabine
should
have
married
henry
the
chances
of
running
across
her
would
be
too
great
since
they
both
knew
the
same
people
henry
would
read
about
the
divorce
and
the
name
sabine
delburg
in
the
paper
too
and
would
then
know
everything
even
if
sabine
had
not
already
informed
him
but
he
almost
thought
she
must
have
done
so
because
he
had
had
no
word
lately
from
his
old
friend
thus
the
time
went
on
for
all
of
them
and
none
but
the
priest
felt
any
premonition
that
christmas
would
certainly
bring
a
climax
in
all
of
their
fates
lord
fordyce
had
hardly
ever
spent
this
season
away
from
his
mother
who
was
a
very
old
lady
now
and
deeply
devoted
to
him
but
the
imperative
desire
to
be
near
his
adored
overcame
any
other
feeling
and
he
with
the
princess
and
her
son
and
father
was
due
to
arrive
at
héronac
on
the
day
before
christmas
eve
he
ran
across
michael
at
the
ritz
the
night
before
he
left
paris
they
were
both
dining
with
parties
and
nodded
across
the
room
and
then
afterwards
in
the
hall
had
a
few
words
i
am
going
down
to
héronac
michael
henry
said
where
do
you
intend
to
spend
the
festive
season
here
i
suppose
yes
it
is
as
good
as
anywhere
michael
returned
i
felt
i
could
not
stand
the
whole
thing
at
arranstoun
i
have
been
away
from
england
so
long
i
must
get
used
to
these
old
anniversaries
again
gradually
here
one
is
free
they
looked
into
each
other
faces
and
henry
noticed
that
michael
had
not
quite
got
his
old
exuberant
expression
of
the
vivid
joy
of
life
he
was
paler
and
even
a
little
haggard
if
so
splendid
a
creature
could
look
that
i
suppose
he
has
been
going
the
pace
over
here
henry
thought
and
wondered
why
michael
manner
should
be
a
little
constrained
then
they
shook
hands
with
their
usual
cordiality
and
said
and
michael
prepared
to
go
on
to
a
supper
party
with
a
feeling
of
wild
rebellion
in
his
heart
the
sight
of
his
old
friend
and
the
knowledge
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
join
sabine
drove
him
almost
mad
again
i
suppose
they
will
be
formally
engaged
in
the
new
year
i
wonder
how
my
little
girl
is
bearing
it
if
she
is
half
as
miserable
as
i
am
god
comfort
her
he
cried
to
himself
and
then
he
felt
he
could
not
stand
miss
daisy
van
der
horn
and
getting
into
his
motor
he
told
the
chauffeur
to
drive
into
the
bois
instead
of
to
the
supper
here
among
the
dark
trees
he
could
think
it
was
all
perfectly
impossible
and
no
happiness
could
possibly
come
to
henry
either
unless
he
succeeded
in
consoling
sabine
when
she
should
be
his
wife
and
this
was
perhaps
the
bitterest
thought
of
all
that
she
should
ever
be
consoled
as
henry
wife
then
the
extreme
strangeness
of
henry
still
being
in
ignorance
of
his
and
sabine
relations
struck
him
she
had
evidently
not
yet
had
the
courage
to
tell
the
truth
and
so
the
thing
would
come
as
a
shock
and
what
would
happen
then
who
could
say
in
any
case
henry
could
not
feel
he
had
not
come
up
to
the
scratch
would
sabine
ever
tell
henry
the
whole
story
he
felt
sure
she
would
not
but
how
could
things
be
expected
to
go
on
with
the
years
it
was
all
unthinkable
now
that
it
had
come
so
close
it
was
about
five
on
the
next
afternoon
that
the
princess
and
her
party
arrived
at
héronac
sabine
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
great
hall
and
greeted
them
with
feverish
delight
but
henry
worshipping
eyes
took
in
at
once
the
fact
that
she
was
greatly
changed
she
made
a
tremendous
fuss
over
girolamo
for
whom
a
most
sumptuous
tea
had
been
prepared
in
his
own
nurseries
and
henry
thought
how
sweet
she
was
with
children
and
how
divinely
happy
they
would
be
in
the
future
when
they
had
some
of
their
own
but
what
had
altered
his
beloved
her
face
had
lost
its
baby
outline
it
seemed
and
her
violet
eyes
were
full
of
deeper
shadows
than
even
they
had
been
in
the
first
few
days
of
their
acquaintance
at
carlsbad
he
must
find
all
this
out
for
himself
directly
they
could
be
alone
this
chance
however
did
not
seem
likely
to
be
vouchsafed
to
him
for
on
the
plea
of
having
such
heaps
to
talk
over
with
moravia
sabine
accompanied
that
lady
to
her
room
and
did
not
appear
again
until
they
were
all
assembled
in
the
big
for
dinner
where
madame
imogen
who
had
returned
the
day
before
was
doing
her
best
to
add
to
the
gaiety
of
the
party
by
her
jolly
remarks
the
lady
of
héronac
had
hardly
been
able
to
control
herself
as
she
waited
for
her
guests
arrival
and
felt
that
to
rush
at
girolamo
would
be
her
only
hope
for
that
morning
the
post
had
brought
the
news
that
the
divorce
would
be
granted
by
the
end
of
january
and
she
would
be
free
she
had
felt
very
faint
as
she
had
read
parsons
letter
no
matter
how
one
might
be
expecting
an
axe
to
fall
when
it
does
the
shock
must
seem
immense
sabine
lay
there
and
moaned
in
her
bed
then
over
her
crept
a
fierce
resentment
against
henry
why
should
she
be
sacrificed
to
him
he
was
forty
years
old
and
had
lived
his
life
and
she
was
young
and
had
not
yet
really
begun
to
enjoy
her
how
would
she
be
able
to
bear
it
or
to
act
even
complaisance
when
every
fiber
of
her
being
was
turning
in
mad
passion
and
desire
to
michael
her
love
then
her
sense
of
justice
resumed
its
sway
henry
at
least
was
not
to
blame
no
one
was
to
blame
but
her
own
self
and
as
she
had
proudly
agreed
with
michael
that
every
one
must
come
up
to
the
scratch
she
must
fulfil
her
part
there
was
no
use
in
being
dramatic
and
deciding
upon
a
certain
course
as
being
a
noble
and
disinterested
one
and
then
in
not
having
the
pluck
to
carry
it
through
she
had
prayed
for
guidance
indeed
and
no
light
had
come
beyond
the
feeling
that
she
must
stick
to
her
word
the
report
of
the
case
would
be
in
the
scotch
papers
and
michael
arranstoun
being
such
a
person
of
consequence
it
would
probably
be
just
announced
in
the
english
journals
too
and
henry
would
see
it
she
could
delay
no
longer
he
must
be
told
the
truth
in
the
next
few
days
the
sight
of
his
kind
distinguished
face
shining
with
love
had
unnerved
her
she
must
tell
him
with
all
seeming
indifference
and
then
close
the
scene
as
quickly
as
she
could
while
sabine
and
moravia
talked
in
the
latter
room
moravia
was
full
of
discomfort
and
anxiety
her
much
loved
friend
appeared
so
strange
she
seemed
to
speak
feverishly
as
it
were
to
be
trying
to
keep
the
conversation
upon
the
lightest
subjects
and
when
moravia
asked
her
how
the
divorce
was
going
she
put
the
question
aside
and
said
that
they
would
speak
of
tiresome
things
like
that
when
christmas
was
over
but
explained
the
princess
i
do
call
it
at
all
tiresome
it
means
your
freedom
sabine
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
marry
henry
he
absolutely
worships
the
ground
you
tread
on
and
if
anything
had
gone
wrong
i
think
it
would
have
simply
killed
him
quite
yes
i
know
returned
sabine
that
thought
is
with
me
day
and
night
what
do
you
mean
darling
i
mean
that
henry
love
frightens
me
morri
how
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
live
up
to
being
the
ideal
creature
he
thinks
that
i
am
and
sabine
gave
a
forced
laugh
you
are
not
a
bad
sort
you
know
the
princess
told
her
a
man
would
be
very
hard
to
please
if
he
was
not
quite
satisfied
with
you
moravia
own
pain
about
the
whole
thing
never
clouded
her
sense
of
justice
henry
love
for
her
friend
had
been
manifest
from
the
very
beginning
so
she
had
never
had
any
illusions
or
doubt
about
it
and
if
she
had
been
so
weak
and
foolish
as
to
allow
herself
to
fall
in
love
with
him
she
must
bear
it
and
not
be
mean
sabine
certainly
was
not
to
blame
i
hope
i
shall
satisfy
him
sabine
sighed
but
i
do
not
know
what
does
satisfy
a
man
tell
me
moravia
you
who
understand
them
it
depends
upon
the
man
and
the
princess
looked
thoughtful
i
know
now
that
if
i
had
been
clever
i
could
have
satisfied
girolamo
for
ages
by
appearing
to
be
always
just
a
little
out
of
his
reach
so
as
to
keep
his
hunting
instinct
alive
when
a
man
is
a
very
strong
passionate
creature
like
that
it
is
the
only
way
make
him
scheme
to
get
you
to
be
lovely
to
him
make
him
wait
and
never
be
sure
if
you
are
going
to
let
him
kiss
you
or
no
and
if
you
adore
him
really
yourself
and
let
him
feel
always
that
he
has
to
use
his
wits
and
all
his
charms
to
keep
you
oh
i
could
have
been
so
happy
if
i
had
known
these
things
in
time
yes
morri
but
henry
is
not
like
that
how
must
i
satisfy
him
moravia
lay
back
in
her
chair
and
discoursed
meditatively
it
is
only
the
very
noblest
natures
in
men
that
women
can
be
perfectly
frank
with
and
as
good
and
kind
and
tender
as
they
feel
they
would
like
to
be
lord
fordyce
is
one
of
these
you
could
load
him
with
devotion
and
love
and
he
would
never
take
advantage
of
you
but
just
to
satisfy
him
sabine
you
need
only
be
you
i
expect
and
she
looked
fondly
at
her
friend
though
darling
i
tell
you
if
you
were
too
nice
to
him
even
he
might
turn
upon
you
some
day
probably
no
woman
can
afford
to
be
really
devoted
to
a
man
they
ca
help
being
mean
and
immediately
thinking
the
poor
thing
is
of
less
consequence
to
please
than
some
capricious
cat
they
can
not
obtain
sabine
nodded
and
moravia
went
on
but
you
need
not
fear
henry
will
adore
you
always
because
you
really
do
care
and
she
sighed
a
little
bitterly
at
the
contrariness
of
things
it
is
good
not
to
care
then
yes
i
think
so
for
happiness
in
a
home
the
woman
ought
always
to
love
a
little
the
less
well
we
shall
be
very
happy
then
and
sabine
echoed
moravia
sigh
but
much
more
bitterly
you
will
be
good
to
him
dearest
moravia
asked
rather
anxiously
he
is
the
grandest
character
i
have
ever
met
in
my
life
yes
i
will
be
good
to
him
just
think
moravia
who
had
domestic
instincts
now
went
on
in
spite
of
the
personal
anguish
she
was
feeling
about
her
own
love
for
henry
you
may
have
the
happiness
soon
of
being
the
mother
of
a
lovely
little
son
like
girolamo
and
she
gave
a
great
sigh
as
she
looked
into
the
fire
sabine
stiffened
all
over
and
an
expression
of
horrified
repugnance
and
dismay
grew
in
her
face
and
she
drew
her
breath
in
with
a
little
gasp
she
had
not
faced
this
thought
before
and
she
could
not
bear
it
now
and
got
up
quickly
saying
she
must
go
off
and
dress
or
she
would
be
late
for
dinner
moravia
looked
after
her
full
of
wonder
and
foreboding
for
henry
what
happiness
could
he
expect
if
the
woman
he
adored
felt
like
that
chapter
xx
christmas
eve
was
particularly
frosty
and
bright
the
sun
poured
through
sabine
windows
high
up
when
she
woke
but
her
heart
was
heavy
as
lead
she
had
not
had
a
single
word
alone
with
henry
the
night
before
and
knew
the
dreaded
must
come
she
did
not
set
herself
to
tell
him
who
her
husband
was
on
this
particular
morning
about
that
she
must
be
guided
by
events
but
she
could
not
make
barriers
between
them
and
must
allow
him
to
come
to
her
he
did
about
ten
his
face
full
of
radiance
and
love
she
had
always
steadfastly
refused
to
take
any
presents
from
him
but
he
had
had
the
most
beautiful
flowers
sent
from
paris
for
her
and
they
had
just
arrived
she
was
taking
them
out
of
their
box
herself
this
made
a
pretext
for
her
to
express
delighted
thanks
and
for
a
little
she
played
her
part
so
well
that
all
henry
doubts
were
set
at
rest
and
he
told
himself
that
he
had
been
imaginative
and
foolish
to
think
that
anything
was
changed
in
her
he
helped
her
to
put
all
the
lovely
blooms
into
vases
so
happy
to
think
they
should
give
her
pleasure
and
all
the
while
he
talked
to
her
lovingly
and
soothingly
until
sabine
could
have
screamed
aloud
so
full
of
remorse
and
constraint
she
felt
if
he
would
only
be
disagreeable
or
unkind
at
last
among
the
giant
violets
they
came
upon
one
bunch
of
white
ones
these
she
took
and
separated
and
making
them
into
two
she
stuck
one
into
her
belt
and
gave
henry
the
other
to
put
into
his
coat
wo
you
fasten
them
in
for
me
dearest
he
said
his
whole
countenance
full
of
passionate
love
she
came
nearer
and
with
hasty
fingers
put
the
flowers
into
his
buttonhole
the
temptation
was
too
great
for
henry
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
drew
her
to
his
side
while
he
bent
and
kissed
her
sweet
red
mouth
she
did
not
resist
him
or
start
away
but
she
grew
white
as
death
and
he
was
conscious
that
as
he
clasped
her
close
a
repressed
shudder
ran
through
her
whole
frame
with
a
little
cry
of
anguish
he
put
her
from
him
and
searched
with
miserable
eyes
for
some
message
in
her
face
but
her
lids
were
lowered
and
her
lips
were
quivering
with
some
pain
my
darling
what
is
it
sabine
you
shrank
from
me
what
does
it
mean
it
means
nothing
henry
and
the
poor
child
tried
to
smile
only
that
i
am
very
foolish
and
silly
and
i
do
not
believe
i
like
caresses
much
and
then
to
make
things
sound
more
light
she
went
on
you
see
i
have
had
so
few
of
them
in
my
life
you
must
be
patient
with
me
until
i
learn
to
understand
of
course
he
would
be
patient
he
assured
her
and
asked
her
to
forgive
him
if
he
had
been
brusque
his
refined
voice
full
of
adoring
contrition
he
caught
at
any
gossamer
thread
to
stifle
the
obvious
thought
that
if
she
loved
him
even
ever
so
little
he
would
not
have
to
accustom
her
to
caresses
she
would
long
ago
have
been
willing
to
learn
all
of
their
meanings
in
his
arms
and
this
was
only
the
second
time
during
their
acquaintance
that
she
had
even
let
him
kiss
her
but
of
her
own
free
will
she
now
came
and
leaned
her
head
against
his
shoulder
henry
she
pleaded
i
am
not
really
as
i
know
you
think
i
am
a
gentle
and
loving
woman
there
are
all
sorts
of
fierce
sides
in
my
character
which
you
have
not
an
idea
of
and
i
am
only
beginning
to
guess
at
them
myself
i
do
not
know
that
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
make
you
happy
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
unless
you
will
be
contented
with
very
little
the
smallest
tip
of
your
finger
is
more
precious
to
me
than
all
the
world
darling
he
protested
with
heat
i
will
be
patient
i
will
be
anything
you
wish
i
will
not
even
touch
you
again
until
you
give
me
leave
oh
i
adore
you
so
sabine
i
will
bear
anything
if
only
you
do
not
mean
that
you
want
to
send
me
away
the
anguish
and
fond
worship
in
his
face
wrung
her
heart
she
started
from
him
and
then
returning
held
out
her
arms
while
she
cried
with
a
pitiful
gasp
almost
as
of
a
sob
in
her
throat
yes
take
me
and
kiss
me
kiss
me
until
i
do
feel
i
mean
until
i
feel
henry
you
said
you
would
make
me
forget
he
encircled
her
with
his
arm
and
led
her
to
a
sofa
murmuring
every
vow
of
passionate
love
and
here
he
sat
by
her
and
kissed
her
and
caressed
her
to
his
heart
content
while
she
remained
apparently
passive
but
still
as
white
as
the
violets
in
her
dress
and
inwardly
she
could
hardly
keep
from
screaming
the
torture
of
it
was
so
great
at
last
she
could
bear
no
more
but
disengaging
herself
from
his
arms
she
slipped
on
to
the
floor
and
there
sat
upon
a
low
footstool
with
her
back
to
the
fire
shivering
as
though
with
icy
cold
lord
fordyce
instincts
were
too
fine
not
to
realize
something
of
the
meaning
of
this
scene
although
not
greatly
learned
in
the
ways
of
women
he
had
kissed
them
often
before
in
his
life
and
none
had
received
his
caresses
like
that
but
since
she
did
not
repulse
him
he
must
not
despair
she
perhaps
was
as
she
said
unused
to
fond
dalliance
and
he
must
be
more
controlled
and
wait
so
with
an
inward
sense
of
pain
and
chill
in
his
heart
he
set
himself
to
divert
her
otherwise
talking
of
the
books
which
they
both
loved
and
so
at
last
when
nicholas
announced
that
déjeuner
was
ready
some
color
and
animation
had
come
back
to
her
face
but
when
she
was
alone
in
her
room
she
looked
out
of
the
high
window
and
passionately
threw
up
her
arms
i
can
not
bear
it
again
she
wailed
fiercely
i
feel
an
utterly
degraded
wretch
at
breakfast
the
père
anselme
watched
her
intently
while
he
kept
his
aloof
air
he
felt
that
something
extra
had
disturbed
her
he
was
to
stay
in
the
house
with
them
on
christmas
night
because
it
was
so
cold
for
him
to
return
to
his
home
after
dinner
and
sabine
could
not
possibly
spare
him
she
assured
him
he
must
be
with
them
at
every
meal
his
wit
was
so
apt
and
with
madame
imogen
aid
he
kept
the
ball
rolling
as
merrily
as
he
could
but
he
no
less
than
henry
was
conscious
that
all
was
not
well
and
afterwards
as
he
went
towards
the
village
he
communed
with
himself
his
kind
heart
torn
with
the
look
of
resignation
in
the
eyes
of
his
dame
she
is
too
young
to
be
made
to
suffer
it
he
said
half
aloud
the
good
god
can
not
ask
so
much
as
a
price
for
wilfulness
and
if
this
man
has
grown
as
distasteful
to
her
as
her
face
seems
to
suggest
nothing
but
misery
could
come
from
their
dual
life
it
was
all
very
cruel
to
the
englishman
no
doubt
but
where
was
the
wisdom
of
letting
two
people
suffer
surely
it
was
better
to
let
only
one
pay
the
stakes
and
if
this
thing
went
on
both
would
have
equal
unhappiness
and
be
tied
together
as
two
animals
in
a
menagerie
cage
no
gentleman
should
accept
such
a
sacrifice
if
the
lord
fordyce
did
not
realize
for
himself
that
something
had
changed
things
it
must
be
that
he
gaston
the
père
anselme
must
intervene
it
might
be
very
fine
and
noble
to
stick
to
one
word
but
it
became
quixotic
if
to
do
so
could
only
bring
misery
to
oneself
and
one
mate
the
good
priest
stalked
on
to
his
and
then
to
his
church
to
see
that
all
should
be
ready
for
that
night
and
he
was
returning
to
the
château
to
tea
when
he
met
henry
taking
a
walk
after
lunch
sabine
had
gone
off
with
moravia
to
girolamo
nurseries
and
lord
fordyce
had
felt
he
must
go
out
and
get
some
air
cloudwater
had
started
with
madame
imogen
in
the
motor
on
a
commission
to
their
little
town
directly
they
had
all
left
the
thus
henry
was
alone
he
greeted
the
père
anselme
gladly
the
old
priest
cultivated
mind
was
to
him
always
a
source
of
delight
so
he
turned
back
and
walked
with
him
into
the
garden
and
along
by
the
sea
wall
instead
of
across
the
causeway
and
to
the
house
this
was
the
doing
of
the
père
anselme
for
he
felt
now
might
be
his
time
henry
had
been
growing
more
and
more
troubled
while
he
had
been
out
by
himself
he
could
not
disguise
the
fact
that
there
was
some
great
change
in
sabine
and
now
his
anxious
mood
craved
sympathy
and
counsel
from
this
her
great
friend
madame
howard
does
not
look
quite
well
father
he
remarked
after
they
had
pulled
some
modern
philosophies
to
pieces
and
there
had
been
a
pause
she
is
so
nervous
what
is
the
cause
of
it
do
you
know
perhaps
this
place
does
not
suit
her
in
the
winter
it
is
so
very
cold
yes
it
is
cold
but
that
is
not
the
reason
and
the
père
anselme
drew
closer
his
old
black
cloak
there
are
other
and
stronger
causes
for
the
state
in
which
we
find
the
dame
sabine
henry
peered
into
his
face
anxiously
in
the
gray
light
it
was
four
the
day
would
soon
be
gone
he
knew
that
these
words
contained
ominous
meaning
and
his
voice
was
rather
unsteady
as
he
asked
what
are
the
reasons
father
please
tell
me
if
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
so
to
me
the
welfare
of
this
dear
lady
is
all
that
matters
in
life
the
curé
of
héronac
cleared
his
throat
and
then
he
said
gently
i
spoke
once
before
to
you
about
the
cinders
and
as
to
whether
or
no
they
were
still
red
that
is
what
causes
her
to
be
restless
she
has
found
that
they
are
yet
alight
lord
fordyce
was
a
brave
man
but
he
grew
very
pale
it
seemed
that
suddenly
all
the
fears
which
his
heart
had
sheltered
though
would
not
own
as
facts
were
rising
before
him
like
giant
skeletons
concrete
and
distinct
but
the
divorce
is
going
well
he
exclaimed
a
little
passionately
his
hurt
was
so
great
she
told
me
so
last
night
she
will
be
free
some
time
in
january
and
will
then
be
my
wife
his
happiness
should
not
be
torn
from
him
without
a
desperate
fight
the
priest
voice
was
very
sad
as
he
answered
that
is
so
she
will
no
doubt
be
ready
to
marry
you
whenever
you
ask
it
is
for
you
to
demand
of
yourself
whether
you
will
accept
her
sacrifice
sacrifice
i
would
never
dream
of
any
sacrifice
it
is
unthinkable
father
anguish
now
distraught
henry
soul
he
stopped
in
his
walk
and
looked
full
at
the
priest
his
fine
distinguished
face
working
with
suffering
the
père
anselme
thought
to
himself
that
he
would
have
done
very
well
for
the
model
of
a
martyr
of
old
it
distressed
him
deeply
to
see
his
pain
and
to
know
that
there
would
be
more
to
come
her
happiness
is
all
that
i
care
for
surely
you
know
this
but
what
has
caused
this
change
has
she
seen
her
husband
again
i
here
henry
stopped
a
sense
of
stupefaction
set
in
what
could
it
all
mean
we
have
never
spoken
upon
the
matter
the
priest
answered
him
i
can
not
say
but
i
think
yes
she
has
certainly
come
under
his
influence
again
have
you
never
searched
in
your
mind
monsieur
to
ask
yourself
who
this
husband
could
be
no
how
should
i
have
done
so
i
have
never
been
in
america
in
my
life
and
then
henry
haggard
eyes
caught
a
look
in
the
old
face
my
god
he
cried
agony
in
his
voice
you
would
suggest
that
it
is
some
one
i
may
know
i
suggest
nothing
monsieur
i
make
my
own
deductions
from
events
will
you
not
do
the
same
henry
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
it
seemed
as
though
reason
were
slipping
from
him
and
then
like
a
flash
of
lightning
which
cleared
his
brain
the
reality
struck
him
it
is
michael
arranstoun
he
said
with
a
moan
we
know
nothing
for
certain
proclaimed
the
père
anselme
but
the
alteration
began
from
this
young
man
visit
that
is
why
i
warned
you
to
well
ascertain
the
truth
of
her
feelings
before
going
further
i
would
have
saved
you
pain
henry
staggered
to
the
wall
of
the
and
leant
there
his
face
was
in
the
afternoon
dying
light
oh
how
hopelessly
blind
i
have
been
the
priest
unclasped
his
hands
his
old
eyes
were
full
of
pity
as
he
answered
we
may
both
have
made
mistakes
you
are
more
aware
of
the
circumstances
than
i
am
the
seigneur
of
arranstoun
is
the
only
man
she
has
seen
here
besides
yourself
you
perhaps
know
whom
she
met
in
england
or
paris
it
is
michael
arranstoun
henry
said
in
a
voice
strangled
and
altered
with
suffering
i
see
every
link
in
the
chain
but
o
god
why
have
they
deceived
me
what
can
it
mean
what
hideous
fiendish
cruelty
and
michael
was
my
old
friend
a
wild
rage
and
resentment
convulsed
him
he
only
felt
that
he
wished
to
kill
both
these
traitors
who
had
tricked
him
and
destroyed
his
beliefs
and
his
happiness
ghastly
thoughts
that
there
might
be
further
disclosures
of
more
shameful
deceptions
to
come
shook
him
he
was
trembling
with
passion
and
then
the
priest
said
something
in
his
grave
quiet
voice
which
almost
stunned
him
has
it
been
done
in
cruelty
my
son
you
must
examine
well
the
facts
before
you
assert
that
you
must
not
forget
that
whoever
the
husband
may
be
he
has
consented
to
divorce
her
and
she
is
now
going
to
give
herself
to
you
is
that
cruelty
my
son
or
is
it
a
fine
keeping
to
a
given
word
it
looks
to
me
more
like
a
noble
sacrifice
unless
the
seigneur
of
arranstoun
was
aware
before
he
ever
came
here
that
madame
howard
was
his
wife
lord
fordyce
controlled
himself
this
thing
must
be
thought
out
no
michael
could
not
have
known
it
after
a
moment
or
two
he
averred
he
even
laughed
over
the
name
when
i
told
it
to
him
and
said
he
had
a
scapegrace
cousin
out
in
arizona
and
wondered
if
the
husband
could
be
the
same
then
further
recollections
came
with
a
frightful
stab
of
anguish
crushing
all
passion
and
anger
and
leaving
only
a
sensation
of
pain
for
he
remembered
that
his
friend
had
given
him
his
word
of
honor
that
he
would
not
interfere
with
him
in
his
and
indeed
would
help
him
in
every
way
he
could
even
to
lending
him
arranstoun
for
the
honeymoon
that
letter
of
his
too
when
he
had
gone
from
héronac
saying
in
it
casually
he
hoped
that
he
henry
thought
that
he
had
played
the
game
yes
it
was
all
perfectly
plain
michael
had
come
there
in
all
innocence
and
could
not
be
blamed
he
remembered
numbers
of
things
unnoticed
at
the
time
his
own
talk
with
sabine
when
he
had
discussed
michael
marriage
and
this
brought
him
up
suddenly
to
her
side
of
the
question
why
in
heaven
name
had
she
not
told
him
the
truth
at
once
why
had
she
pretended
not
to
recognize
michael
for
however
michael
might
have
started
since
he
henry
was
not
looking
at
him
sabine
whose
face
he
had
been
gazing
into
all
the
while
had
shown
no
faintest
recognition
of
him
what
a
superb
actress
she
must
be
or
perhaps
having
only
seen
him
those
two
times
in
her
life
for
those
short
moments
she
really
did
not
recognize
him
then
the
whole
thing
was
so
staggering
in
its
hideous
tragedy
his
brain
almost
refused
to
think
but
he
said
this
last
thought
aloud
and
the
priest
strange
sudden
silence
struck
even
his
numbed
sense
she
had
only
seen
him
for
such
a
little
while
they
parted
immediately
after
the
wedding
it
was
merely
an
empty
ceremony
you
know
why
then
should
she
have
had
any
haunting
memories
of
him
the
père
anselme
avoided
answering
this
question
by
asking
another
you
knew
that
the
seigneur
of
arranstoun
was
wedded
it
would
seem
how
was
that
then
henry
told
him
the
outline
of
michael
story
and
the
cruel
irony
of
fate
in
having
made
him
himself
leave
the
house
before
seeing
sabine
struck
them
both
what
can
her
reasons
have
been
for
not
telling
me
all
this
time
father
the
unhappy
man
asked
at
last
in
a
hopeless
voice
can
you
in
any
way
guess
the
père
anselme
mused
for
a
moment
i
have
my
own
thoughts
upon
the
matter
my
son
we
who
live
lonely
lives
very
close
to
nature
get
into
the
way
of
studying
things
i
have
as
i
told
you
made
some
deductions
but
if
you
will
permit
me
to
give
you
some
counsel
i
would
tell
you
to
go
back
to
the
château
now
with
no
and
seek
her
immediately
and
get
her
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
yourself
of
what
good
for
you
and
me
to
speculate
since
we
neither
of
us
know
all
the
facts
or
even
if
our
suppositions
are
correct
then
as
lord
fordyce
hesitated
he
continued
the
time
has
passed
for
reticence
there
should
be
no
more
avoiding
of
feared
subjects
go
go
my
son
and
discover
the
entire
truth
and
what
then
the
cry
came
from
henry
agonized
heart
but
the
priest
answered
gravely
that
is
in
the
hand
of
god
my
duty
is
done
and
so
they
returned
in
silence
the
père
anselme
praying
fervently
to
himself
and
when
they
reached
the
house
lord
fordyce
stumbled
up
the
stone
stairs
heavily
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
sabine
he
had
seen
moravia
at
her
window
in
the
inner
building
and
knew
that
this
woman
who
held
his
life
in
her
hand
would
be
alone
then
in
response
to
a
gentle
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
sabine
had
been
sitting
at
her
an
open
blue
at
her
side
she
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
great
apartment
so
that
henry
had
some
way
to
go
toward
her
in
the
gloom
as
but
for
the
large
lamp
near
her
and
the
blazing
wood
fire
at
each
end
there
was
no
light
in
the
vast
room
she
rose
to
meet
him
a
gentle
smile
upon
her
face
and
then
when
he
came
close
to
her
she
realized
that
something
had
happened
and
suddenly
put
her
hand
out
to
steady
herself
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
henry
what
is
it
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
come
let
us
go
over
there
and
sit
down
and
she
drew
him
to
the
same
sofa
where
that
very
morning
they
had
sat
when
she
had
let
him
kiss
her
this
thought
was
extra
pain
he
was
so
very
quiet
he
frightened
her
and
his
gray
eyes
looked
into
hers
with
such
a
world
of
despair
but
no
reproach
sabine
he
commanded
in
a
voice
out
of
which
had
vanished
all
life
and
hope
tell
me
the
whole
story
my
dear
love
she
clasped
her
hands
convulsively
so
the
dreaded
moment
had
come
there
would
be
no
use
in
making
any
excuses
or
protestations
her
duty
now
was
to
master
herself
and
collect
her
words
to
tell
him
the
truth
the
utter
misery
in
his
noble
face
wrung
her
heart
so
that
her
voice
trembled
too
much
to
speak
at
first
then
she
controlled
it
and
began
so
all
was
told
at
last
then
henry
took
her
two
cold
hands
again
and
drew
her
up
with
him
as
he
rose
sabine
he
said
with
deep
emotion
his
heart
at
breaking
point
but
all
thought
of
himself
put
aside
in
the
supreme
unselfishness
of
his
worship
sabine
i
will
prove
to
you
what
true
love
means
but
now
my
dearest
i
will
say
i
think
i
must
go
to
my
room
for
a
little
this
has
been
a
tremendous
shock
he
bent
and
kissed
her
forehead
with
reverence
and
blessing
as
her
father
might
have
done
and
hiding
all
further
emotion
he
walked
steadily
from
the
room
chapter
xxi
when
lord
fordyce
found
himself
alone
it
felt
as
if
life
itself
must
leave
him
the
agony
of
pain
was
so
great
the
fiendish
irony
of
circumstances
it
almost
seemed
that
each
time
he
had
intended
to
do
a
good
thing
he
had
been
punished
he
had
left
arranstoun
for
the
best
motive
and
so
had
not
seen
sabine
and
thus
saved
himself
from
future
pain
he
had
taken
michael
to
héronac
out
of
kindly
friendship
and
this
had
robbed
him
of
his
happiness
but
awful
as
the
discovery
was
now
it
was
not
half
so
terrible
as
it
would
have
been
if
the
truth
had
only
come
to
him
later
when
sabine
had
become
his
wife
he
must
be
thankful
for
that
things
had
always
been
inevitable
it
was
plain
to
be
understood
that
she
had
loved
michael
all
along
and
nothing
he
personally
could
have
done
with
all
his
devotion
could
have
changed
this
fact
he
ought
to
have
known
that
it
was
hopeless
and
that
he
was
only
living
in
a
fool
paradise
never
once
had
he
seen
the
light
in
her
eyes
for
himself
which
sprang
there
even
at
the
mention
of
name
what
was
this
tremendous
power
this
man
possessed
to
so
deeply
affect
women
to
so
greatly
charm
every
one
was
it
just
it
as
the
princess
had
said
anguish
now
fell
upon
henry
there
was
no
consolation
anywhere
to
be
found
he
went
over
again
all
the
details
of
the
story
he
had
heard
and
himself
filled
up
the
links
in
the
chain
how
brutal
it
was
of
michael
to
have
induced
her
to
stay
even
if
she
remained
of
her
own
accord
and
then
the
frightful
thoughtless
recklessness
of
letting
her
go
off
afterwards
just
because
he
was
angry
wild
fury
blazed
up
against
his
old
friend
the
poor
darling
little
girl
to
be
left
to
suffer
all
alone
oh
how
tender
and
passionately
devoted
he
would
have
been
under
the
same
circumstances
would
michael
ever
make
her
happy
or
take
proper
care
of
her
he
paced
his
room
his
mind
racked
with
pain
every
single
turn
of
events
came
back
to
him
and
his
own
incredible
blindness
how
had
he
been
so
unseeing
how
to
begin
with
had
he
not
recalled
the
name
of
sabine
as
being
the
one
he
had
read
long
ago
in
the
paper
as
that
of
the
girl
whom
michael
had
gone
through
the
ceremony
of
marriage
with
it
had
faded
completely
from
his
memory
everything
seemed
to
have
combined
to
lead
him
on
to
predestined
disaster
and
misery
even
in
sabine
and
michael
combining
to
keep
the
matter
secret
from
him
not
to
cause
him
pain
all
had
augmented
the
suffering
now
if
but
there
was
no
good
in
contemplating
ifs
what
he
had
to
do
was
to
think
clearly
as
to
what
would
be
the
wisest
course
to
secure
his
happiness
that
must
be
his
first
consideration
after
that
he
must
face
his
own
cruel
fate
with
what
courage
he
could
command
her
happiness
could
only
come
through
the
divorce
proceedings
being
stopped
at
once
and
in
her
being
free
to
go
back
to
the
man
whom
she
loved
then
the
aspect
that
michael
had
been
willing
to
do
a
really
fine
thing
for
the
sake
of
friendship
struck
him
perhaps
he
was
worthy
of
sabine
after
all
and
they
were
young
and
absolutely
suited
to
one
another
no
the
wickedness
would
have
been
if
he
whose
youth
had
passed
had
claimed
her
and
come
between
he
was
only
now
going
through
the
same
agony
his
friend
must
have
done
and
he
had
a
stronger
motive
to
help
him
in
the
wish
to
secure
the
joy
of
this
adored
woman
whereas
michael
knew
he
was
condemning
her
to
sorrow
as
well
as
himself
and
had
been
strong
enough
to
do
it
simply
from
honor
and
friendship
no
he
had
no
right
to
think
of
him
as
brutal
or
not
fine
and
now
it
was
for
him
henry
to
bring
back
happiness
to
his
darling
and
to
his
old
friend
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
beside
the
fire
and
set
himself
to
think
to
have
to
take
some
decided
course
came
as
a
relief
he
would
go
out
into
the
village
and
telegraph
to
michael
to
come
to
héronac
at
once
he
was
in
paris
staying
at
the
ritz
he
knew
he
could
be
there
on
christmas
day
surely
that
was
well
when
peace
and
towards
men
should
be
over
all
the
earth
and
he
henry
would
meet
him
at
the
house
of
the
père
anselme
and
explain
all
to
him
and
then
take
him
back
to
sabine
he
would
not
see
her
again
until
then
he
found
telegraph
forms
on
his
and
rapidly
wrote
out
his
message
come
immediately
by
first
train
meet
me
at
house
of
père
anselme
a
matter
of
gravest
importance
to
you
and
sabine
and
he
signed
it
fordyce
then
he
firmly
controlled
himself
and
went
off
with
it
into
the
night
the
cold
air
struck
his
face
and
confronted
him
with
its
fierceness
the
wind
was
getting
up
the
waves
would
again
be
rough
the
village
was
not
far
away
and
he
soon
had
reached
his
goal
and
sent
the
telegram
then
he
stopped
at
the
he
must
speak
once
more
to
the
priest
the
père
anselme
led
him
in
to
his
bare
little
parlor
and
drew
him
to
the
warm
china
stove
it
was
only
two
hours
since
they
had
parted
but
lord
fordyce
looked
like
an
old
man
i
have
come
to
tell
you
my
father
he
said
that
i
know
all
of
the
story
now
and
it
is
terrible
enough
but
i
want
you
to
help
me
to
secure
her
happiness
michael
arranstoun
is
her
husband
as
you
supposed
and
she
loves
him
the
old
priest
nodded
his
head
comprehendingly
and
henry
went
on
they
only
parted
to
save
me
pain
it
was
a
tremendous
sacrifice
which
of
course
i
can
not
accept
so
now
i
have
sent
for
him
and
i
want
you
to
let
me
meet
him
here
at
your
house
and
explain
everything
to
him
before
he
sees
her
i
hope
if
he
gets
my
telegram
in
time
he
will
catch
the
train
from
paris
at
midnight
it
gets
in
about
nine
in
the
morning
then
they
can
be
happy
on
christmas
day
you
have
done
nobly
my
son
and
the
père
anselme
lifted
his
hand
in
blessing
it
is
very
merciful
that
this
has
been
in
time
you
will
not
be
permitted
to
suffer
beyond
your
strength
since
you
have
done
well
the
good
god
is
beyond
all
things
just
my
home
is
at
your
service
and
how
is
she
our
dear
dame
does
she
know
that
her
husband
will
come
she
knows
nothing
i
told
her
we
should
settle
all
questions
she
offered
to
keep
her
word
to
me
the
dear
child
and
she
told
you
the
whole
story
she
had
the
courage
yes
that
was
fine
of
her
because
she
has
never
spoken
of
all
her
sorrows
directly
even
to
me
she
told
me
everything
father
there
are
no
secrets
any
more
and
her
story
is
a
pitiful
one
because
she
was
so
young
it
is
possible
it
has
been
well
for
them
the
priest
said
meditatively
looking
into
the
glowing
fire
in
the
stove
whose
door
he
had
opened
they
were
too
young
and
undisciplined
at
first
for
happiness
they
have
come
through
so
much
suffering
now
they
will
cling
to
each
other
and
joy
and
not
let
it
slip
from
their
hands
she
is
more
suited
to
such
a
one
as
the
seigneur
of
arranstoun
than
any
other
there
is
a
vigor
of
youth
in
her
which
must
find
expression
and
it
is
something
to
be
of
noble
blood
after
all
here
he
turned
and
looked
contemplatively
at
henry
it
makes
one
able
to
surmount
anguish
and
remain
a
gentleman
with
manners
even
at
such
a
cruel
crisis
as
this
you
have
all
my
deep
understanding
and
sympathy
my
son
i
too
have
passed
that
way
and
know
your
pain
but
consolation
will
come
i
find
it
here
in
the
cure
of
souls
you
will
find
it
in
your
england
leading
your
fellow
countrymen
to
finer
ends
it
is
not
for
all
of
us
the
glory
of
the
dawn
or
the
meridian
but
we
can
all
secure
a
sunset
of
blessed
peace
if
we
will
and
then
as
henry
wrung
his
thin
old
hand
he
muttered
with
tenderness
and
while
a
moisture
glistened
in
his
keen
black
eyes
and
when
the
door
was
closed
upon
his
guest
he
turned
back
into
his
little
room
this
thought
going
on
with
him
a
great
gentleman
though
my
dame
will
be
happier
with
the
fierce
one
youth
must
have
its
day
and
all
is
well
but
henry
striding
in
the
dark
with
the
sound
of
the
rushing
sea
for
company
found
no
consolation
when
he
got
back
to
the
château
and
was
going
up
the
chief
staircase
to
his
room
he
met
moravia
coming
down
she
had
just
left
sabine
and
knew
the
outlines
of
what
had
happened
her
astonishment
and
distress
had
been
great
but
underneath
as
she
was
only
human
there
was
some
sense
of
personal
upliftment
she
could
try
to
comfort
the
disconsolate
lover
at
least
sabine
had
given
her
to
understand
that
nothing
was
finally
settled
between
herself
and
henry
but
moravia
felt
there
could
be
only
one
end
she
knew
he
was
too
unselfish
to
hold
sabine
for
an
instant
once
he
understood
that
she
would
rather
be
free
so
it
was
in
the
character
of
fond
friend
that
she
put
out
her
hand
and
grasped
his
in
silent
sympathy
henry
she
whispered
with
tears
in
her
usually
merry
eyes
my
heart
is
breaking
for
you
can
i
do
anything
he
would
rather
that
she
had
not
spoken
of
his
sorrow
at
all
being
a
singularly
reticent
person
but
he
was
touched
by
the
love
and
solicitude
in
her
face
and
took
and
held
her
white
fingers
you
are
always
so
good
to
me
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
she
slid
her
other
hand
into
his
arm
and
drew
him
on
into
the
little
which
was
always
set
apart
for
her
close
to
her
room
i
am
going
to
take
care
of
you
for
the
next
hour
anyway
you
look
frozen
she
told
him
i
shall
make
you
sit
in
the
big
chair
by
the
fire
while
i
give
you
something
to
drink
it
is
only
six
then
with
fond
severity
she
pushed
him
into
a
comfortable
and
leaving
him
gave
an
order
to
her
maid
in
the
next
room
to
bring
some
brandy
but
before
it
came
moravia
went
back
again
and
drawing
a
low
stool
sat
down
almost
at
henry
feet
the
fire
and
her
gentleness
were
soothing
to
him
as
he
lay
there
huddled
in
the
chair
the
physical
reaction
was
upon
him
from
the
shock
and
he
felt
almost
as
though
he
were
going
to
faint
moravia
watched
him
anxiously
for
some
time
without
speaking
he
was
so
very
pale
then
she
got
up
quickly
when
the
maid
brought
in
the
tray
and
pouring
him
out
some
brandy
she
brought
it
over
and
knelt
down
by
his
side
drink
this
she
commanded
kindly
i
shall
not
stir
until
you
do
henry
took
the
glass
with
nerveless
fingers
and
gulped
down
the
liquid
as
he
was
bid
but
although
she
took
the
glass
from
him
she
did
not
get
off
her
knees
indeed
when
she
had
pushed
it
on
to
the
tray
near
her
she
came
closer
still
and
laid
her
cheek
against
his
coat
taking
his
right
hand
and
chafing
it
between
her
own
to
bring
back
some
life
into
him
while
she
kept
up
a
murmured
flow
of
sweet
sympathy
as
one
would
talk
to
an
unhappy
child
henry
was
not
actually
listening
to
her
but
the
warmth
and
the
great
vibrations
of
love
coming
from
her
began
to
affect
him
unconsciously
so
that
he
slipped
his
arm
round
her
and
drew
her
to
his
side
henry
she
whispered
with
a
little
gasp
in
her
breath
i
would
take
all
pain
away
from
you
dear
if
i
could
but
i
ca
do
anything
only
just
pet
and
love
you
into
feeling
better
after
all
everything
passes
in
time
i
thought
i
should
never
get
over
the
death
of
my
husband
girolamo
and
now
i
do
care
a
bit
in
fact
i
only
care
about
you
and
want
to
make
you
less
unhappy
the
princess
thoroughly
believed
in
la
rochefoucauld
maxim
with
the
advice
that
people
were
more
likely
to
take
to
a
new
passion
when
still
agitated
by
the
rests
of
the
old
one
than
if
they
were
completely
cured
she
intended
now
that
she
was
released
from
all
honor
to
her
friend
to
do
her
very
uttermost
to
draw
henry
to
herself
and
thought
it
much
wiser
to
begin
to
strike
when
the
iron
was
hot
henry
did
not
answer
her
he
merely
pressed
her
hand
while
he
thought
how
her
action
was
and
how
very
kind
she
was
certainly
the
dearest
woman
he
had
ever
met
beyond
sabine
moravia
was
not
at
all
discouraged
but
continued
to
rub
his
hands
first
one
and
then
the
other
while
he
remained
passive
under
her
touch
sabine
is
perfectly
crushed
with
all
this
she
went
on
i
have
just
left
her
she
does
not
know
what
you
mean
to
do
but
i
am
sure
i
can
guess
you
mean
to
give
her
back
to
arranstoun
and
it
will
be
much
better
she
has
always
been
in
love
with
him
i
believe
and
would
never
have
agreed
to
try
to
arrange
for
a
divorce
if
she
had
not
been
awfully
jealous
about
daisy
van
der
horn
i
remember
now
telling
her
quite
innocently
of
the
reports
about
them
in
paris
before
we
went
to
england
and
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
noticed
she
was
rather
spiteful
over
it
at
the
time
henry
did
not
answer
so
she
continued
in
a
frank
way
you
can
imagine
what
a
strange
character
sabine
has
when
i
tell
you
in
all
these
years
of
our
intimate
friendship
she
never
has
told
me
a
word
of
her
story
until
just
now
she
was
keeping
it
all
in
to
herself
i
ca
think
why
henry
did
speak
at
last
but
his
words
came
slowly
she
wanted
to
forget
poor
little
girl
and
that
was
the
best
way
to
bury
it
all
out
of
sight
there
you
are
quite
wrong
returned
moravia
now
seated
upon
her
footstool
again
very
close
with
her
elbows
propped
on
henry
knees
while
she
still
held
his
hands
and
intermittently
caressed
them
with
her
cheek
that
is
the
way
to
keep
hurts
burning
and
paining
forever
fostering
them
all
in
the
dark
it
is
much
better
to
speak
about
them
and
let
the
sun
get
in
on
them
and
take
all
their
sorrow
away
that
is
why
i
would
not
let
you
be
by
yourself
now
dear
friend
as
i
suppose
one
of
your
reserved
countrymen
would
have
done
i
just
determined
to
make
you
talk
about
it
and
to
realize
that
there
are
lots
of
lovely
other
things
to
comfort
you
and
that
you
are
not
all
alone
henry
was
strangely
touched
at
her
kind
common
sense
he
already
felt
better
and
not
so
utterly
crushed
out
with
despair
he
told
her
how
sweet
and
good
she
was
and
what
a
true
unselfish
woman
but
moravia
shook
her
head
i
am
not
a
bit
it
is
purely
interested
because
i
am
so
awfully
fond
of
you
myself
i
to
pet
you
there
and
she
laughed
softly
so
happy
to
see
that
she
had
been
able
even
to
make
this
slight
effect
for
she
saw
the
color
had
come
back
in
a
measure
to
his
face
and
her
keen
brain
told
her
that
this
was
the
right
tack
to
go
upon
not
to
be
too
serious
or
show
any
sentiment
but
just
to
use
a
sharp
knife
and
cut
round
all
the
wound
and
then
pour
honey
and
balm
into
it
herself
you
and
sabine
would
never
really
have
been
happy
together
she
now
told
him
you
were
much
too
subservient
to
her
and
let
her
order
you
about
she
would
have
grown
into
a
bully
now
arranstoun
stand
a
scrap
of
nonsense
i
am
sure
he
would
make
any
woman
obey
him
if
necessary
by
using
brute
force
they
are
perfectly
suited
to
one
another
and
very
soon
you
will
realize
it
and
wo
care
do
you
remember
how
we
talked
at
dinner
that
night
at
ebbsworth
about
women
having
to
go
through
a
stage
in
their
lives
sooner
or
later
when
they
adored
just
strength
in
a
man
and
wanted
a
master
well
i
wondered
then
if
sabine
had
passed
hers
but
i
was
afraid
of
hurting
you
so
i
would
not
say
that
i
rather
thought
she
had
not
oh
i
wish
you
had
henry
spoke
at
last
and
yet
no
the
whole
thing
has
been
inevitable
from
the
first
i
see
it
plainly
the
only
thing
is
if
i
had
found
it
out
sooner
it
might
have
saved
sabine
pain
but
it
is
not
too
late
thank
god
the
divorce
proceedings
can
be
quashed
it
would
have
been
a
little
ironical
if
she
had
had
to
marry
him
again
yes
moravia
agreed
now
if
we
could
only
get
him
to
come
here
immediately
we
could
explain
it
all
to
him
and
make
him
wire
to
his
lawyers
at
once
i
have
already
sent
for
him
i
think
he
will
arrive
at
nine
how
glorious
it
was
just
the
dear
splendid
thing
you
would
do
henry
moravia
cried
getting
up
from
her
knees
but
we
wo
tell
sabine
we
will
just
let
her
mope
there
up
in
her
room
feeling
as
miserable
as
she
deserves
to
be
for
not
knowing
her
own
mind
we
will
all
have
a
nice
dinner
no
that
wo
be
it
you
and
i
will
dine
alone
here
up
in
this
room
and
papa
can
talk
to
madame
imogen
in
this
house
thank
goodness
we
can
all
do
what
we
like
and
i
am
not
going
to
leave
you
henry
until
we
have
got
to
say
i
do
care
whether
you
want
me
or
not
i
have
just
taken
charge
of
you
and
i
mean
you
to
do
what
i
wish
there
and
she
crept
closer
to
him
again
and
laid
her
face
upon
his
breast
so
that
his
cheek
was
resting
upon
her
soft
dark
hair
great
waves
of
comfort
flowed
to
henry
this
sweet
woman
loved
him
at
all
events
so
he
put
his
arm
round
her
again
while
he
assured
her
he
did
want
her
and
that
she
was
an
angel
and
other
such
terms
and
by
the
time
she
allowed
him
to
go
to
his
room
to
dress
for
dinner
a
great
measure
of
his
usual
nerve
and
balance
was
restored
she
had
not
given
him
a
moment
to
think
even
shaking
her
finger
at
him
and
saying
that
if
he
was
more
than
twenty
minutes
dressing
she
would
herself
come
and
fetch
him
and
bring
him
back
to
her
room
then
when
he
had
left
her
this
true
daughter
of
eve
after
ordering
dinner
to
be
served
to
them
proceeded
to
make
herself
as
beautiful
as
possible
for
the
next
scene
she
felt
radiant
it
was
enormous
what
she
had
done
why
he
was
on
the
verge
of
suicide
she
said
to
herself
and
now
he
is
almost
ready
to
smile
before
the
evening
is
over
i
shall
have
made
him
kiss
me
and
before
a
month
is
past
we
shall
be
engaged
what
perfect
nonsense
to
have
silly
mawkish
sentiment
over
anything
the
thing
to
do
is
to
win
one
game
chapter
xxii
lord
fordyce
found
himself
dressing
in
the
usual
way
and
with
the
usual
care
such
creatures
of
habit
are
we
and
yet
two
hours
earlier
he
had
felt
that
life
was
over
for
him
although
he
did
not
know
it
moravia
had
been
like
a
strong
restorative
applied
at
the
right
moment
and
the
crisis
of
his
agony
had
gone
by
it
was
not
that
he
was
not
still
overcome
by
sorrow
or
that
moments
of
complete
anguish
would
not
recur
but
the
current
had
been
diverted
from
taking
a
fatal
turn
and
gradually
things
would
mend
the
perfect
practical
common
sense
of
moravia
was
so
good
for
him
she
was
not
intellectual
like
sabine
she
was
just
a
dear
beautiful
kind
ordinary
woman
extremely
in
love
with
him
but
too
truly
american
ever
to
lose
her
head
and
now
in
real
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
playing
so
delightful
a
game
she
was
thoroughly
versed
in
the
ways
of
male
creatures
and
although
she
possessed
none
of
sabine
indescribable
charm
she
had
had
numbers
of
admirers
and
lovers
and
was
in
every
way
fitted
to
cope
with
any
man
this
evening
she
had
determined
so
to
soothe
flatter
and
pet
henry
that
he
should
go
to
bed
not
realizing
that
there
was
any
change
in
himself
but
should
be
in
reality
completely
changed
her
preparations
had
been
swift
but
elaborate
she
had
rushed
to
madame
imogen
room
and
got
her
to
take
special
messages
to
the
chef
and
dinner
would
be
waited
on
by
her
own
maid
with
nicholas
just
to
run
in
and
open
the
champagne
then
she
selected
a
ravishing
chiffon
all
lacy
and
fresh
and
lastly
she
had
a
big
fire
made
up
and
all
the
curtains
drawn
and
so
she
awaited
henry
coming
with
anticipations
of
delight
she
had
even
got
cloudwater
that
aprivoisé
to
mix
her
two
dry
martini
cocktails
which
were
ready
for
her
guest
henry
knocked
at
the
door
exactly
at
eight
and
she
went
to
meet
him
with
all
the
air
of
authority
of
a
mother
and
led
him
into
the
room
pushing
him
gently
into
the
chair
she
had
prepared
for
him
a
man
may
have
a
broken
heart
but
the
hurt
can
not
feel
so
great
when
he
is
surrounded
with
every
comfort
and
ministered
to
by
a
beautiful
young
woman
who
is
not
only
in
love
with
him
but
has
the
nerve
to
keep
her
head
and
not
neglect
a
single
point
which
can
be
of
use
in
her
game
if
she
had
shown
him
too
much
sympathy
or
just
been
and
silent
and
adoring
henry
by
this
time
would
have
been
quite
as
unhappy
as
he
had
been
at
first
but
he
was
too
courteous
by
nature
not
to
try
to
be
polite
and
appreciative
of
kindness
when
she
tendered
it
so
frankly
no
matter
what
his
inward
feelings
might
be
and
this
she
knew
she
could
count
upon
and
meant
to
exploit
she
argued
very
truly
that
if
he
were
obliged
to
act
it
would
brace
him
up
and
be
beneficial
to
him
even
though
at
the
moment
he
would
much
prefer
to
be
alone
so
now
she
made
him
drink
the
cocktail
and
then
she
deliberately
spoke
of
sabine
wondering
if
she
would
be
awfully
surprised
to
see
michael
and
if
he
would
take
her
back
with
him
to
arranstoun
henry
winced
at
every
word
but
he
had
to
answer
and
presently
he
found
he
did
not
feel
so
sad
then
with
dexterity
she
turned
the
conversation
to
english
politics
and
got
him
to
explain
points
to
her
and
at
every
moment
she
poured
in
insidious
flattery
and
frank
kind
affection
so
that
by
the
time
the
ice
had
come
henry
had
begun
to
feel
unaccountably
soothed
she
was
really
a
beautiful
woman
and
arranged
with
a
wonderful
and
he
realized
that
she
had
never
looked
more
charming
or
been
so
sweet
she
had
all
the
sense
of
power
being
on
her
side
now
that
she
had
a
free
hand
unhampered
by
honor
to
her
friend
and
when
the
dessert
and
the
cigarettes
had
come
she
felt
that
she
might
indulge
in
a
little
sentiment
she
remembered
that
he
only
smoked
cigars
and
got
up
and
helped
him
to
light
one
of
his
own
and
when
she
was
quite
close
to
him
she
put
her
hand
out
and
stroked
his
hair
even
if
he
does
not
like
it
at
first
she
told
herself
he
is
too
polite
to
say
so
and
presently
just
because
he
is
a
man
it
will
give
him
a
thrill
i
do
love
your
light
hair
henry
she
said
aloud
and
it
is
so
well
brushed
you
englishmen
are
certainly
creatures
and
i
like
your
lazy
easy
grace
as
though
you
would
never
put
yourself
out
for
any
one
i
ca
bear
a
fuss
she
puffed
her
cigarette
and
did
not
wait
for
him
to
answer
her
but
prattled
on
perfectly
at
ease
even
his
courtesy
would
not
have
prevented
him
from
snubbing
her
if
she
had
been
the
least
tentative
in
her
caressings
or
the
least
diffident
but
she
just
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
she
could
stroke
his
hair
if
she
wanted
to
and
presently
it
began
to
give
him
a
sensation
of
pleasure
and
rest
if
she
had
by
word
or
look
suggested
that
she
expected
some
return
henry
would
have
frozen
at
once
but
all
she
did
was
apparently
only
to
please
herself
and
so
he
had
no
defense
to
make
still
in
the
character
of
domestic
tyrant
she
presently
led
him
to
the
comfortable
armchair
and
once
more
seated
herself
upon
the
stool
close
to
the
fire
by
his
side
here
she
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
letting
the
comfort
of
the
whole
scene
sink
in
to
his
brain
and
then
when
the
maid
came
in
to
clear
away
the
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
piano
where
she
played
some
soft
but
not
sentimental
tunes
music
of
a
certain
sort
would
be
the
worst
thing
for
him
but
a
light
air
while
marie
was
in
the
room
could
do
no
harm
though
when
she
went
over
close
to
him
again
she
saw
that
even
this
pause
had
allowed
him
time
to
think
and
that
his
face
was
once
more
overcome
by
melancholy
although
he
greeted
her
with
a
smile
something
further
must
be
done
henry
she
said
cooingly
kneeling
down
beside
him
and
taking
his
hand
will
you
promise
me
something
please
i
am
not
clever
like
you
but
i
do
know
one
splendid
recipe
for
taking
away
pain
every
time
the
thought
of
sabine
comes
up
to
you
and
the
old
pictures
you
used
to
hold
look
them
squarely
in
the
face
and
then
deliberately
replace
them
with
others
that
you
can
obtain
the
strange
law
of
periodicity
will
be
in
motion
and
if
you
have
only
will
enough
gradually
the
pictures
that
can
be
yours
will
unconsciously
have
taken
the
place
of
the
old
ones
which
have
caused
you
pain
is
it
not
much
better
to
do
that
than
just
to
let
yourself
grieve
surely
it
is
more
like
a
man
henry
looked
at
her
a
little
startled
this
idea
had
never
presented
itself
to
him
yes
it
was
certainly
more
like
a
man
to
try
any
measure
than
just
to
grieve
and
what
if
there
should
be
some
truth
in
this
suggestion
what
did
the
law
of
periodicity
mean
what
an
american
phrase
how
apt
they
were
at
coining
expressive
sentences
he
looked
into
the
glowing
ashes
there
he
seemed
to
see
in
ruins
the
whole
fabric
of
his
dreams
but
if
there
was
a
law
which
brought
thoughts
back
and
back
again
at
the
same
hour
each
day
then
moravia
was
right
he
must
blot
out
the
old
pictures
and
conjure
up
new
ones
but
what
could
they
be
you
are
musing
henry
moravia
voice
went
on
are
you
thinking
over
what
i
said
i
hope
so
and
you
will
find
it
is
true
see
i
will
tell
you
what
to
visualize
there
in
the
fire
you
are
looking
at
a
splendid
english
home
all
peace
and
warmth
and
you
see
yourself
in
it
happy
and
surrounded
by
friends
and
you
see
yourself
a
great
man
the
center
of
political
interest
and
everything
coming
toward
you
that
heart
can
desire
it
is
awfully
wanting
in
common
sense
to
think
because
you
can
not
obtain
one
woman
there
are
none
others
in
the
world
awfully
agreed
henry
suddenly
taking
in
the
attractive
picture
she
made
seated
there
at
his
knees
her
white
hand
holding
his
hand
his
thoughts
wandered
for
a
moment
as
thought
will
do
when
the
mind
is
overstrained
they
wandered
to
the
speculation
of
why
american
women
should
have
such
small
and
white
hands
and
then
he
brought
himself
back
to
the
actual
conversation
you
mean
to
tell
me
he
said
that
if
every
time
i
remember
when
i
am
dwelling
upon
the
subject
which
pains
me
that
i
must
make
my
thoughts
turn
to
other
things
which
give
me
pleasure
that
gradually
the
new
thoughts
will
banish
the
old
of
course
i
mean
that
moravia
told
him
everything
comes
in
cycles
that
is
why
people
get
into
habits
you
just
try
henry
you
can
cure
the
habit
of
pain
as
easily
as
you
can
cure
any
habit
it
is
all
a
question
of
will
she
saw
that
she
had
created
interest
in
his
eyes
and
rejoiced
that
crisis
had
passed
and
it
would
be
safe
to
go
on
i
shall
not
get
him
to
kiss
me
after
all
she
decided
to
herself
if
i
did
he
would
probably
feel
annoyed
with
some
ridiculous
sense
of
a
too
sudden
disloyalty
to
sabine
memory
and
he
might
be
huffed
with
himself
too
thinking
he
had
given
way
it
might
wound
his
vanity
i
shall
just
draw
him
right
out
and
make
him
want
to
kiss
me
but
not
consciously
and
then
it
will
be
safe
when
he
is
at
that
pitch
to
let
him
go
off
to
bed
this
plan
she
proceeded
to
put
into
practice
she
exploited
the
subject
they
had
been
talking
of
to
its
length
and
aroused
a
sharp
discussion
and
argument
while
she
took
care
to
place
herself
in
the
most
alluring
attitudes
as
close
to
henry
as
she
possibly
could
be
while
maintaining
a
basis
of
frank
friendship
and
then
she
changed
the
current
by
getting
him
to
explain
to
her
exactly
what
he
had
done
about
michael
and
how
they
should
arrange
the
meeting
between
the
two
putting
into
her
eagerness
all
the
sparkle
that
she
would
have
used
in
collaborating
with
him
over
the
placing
of
the
presents
upon
a
christmas
tree
until
at
last
henry
began
to
take
some
sort
of
pride
in
the
thing
itself
i
want
you
to
let
sabine
think
you
are
just
going
to
forgive
her
for
her
deception
but
intend
her
to
keep
her
word
to
you
and
then
you
can
take
arranstoun
up
to
her
when
you
have
brought
him
from
the
père
anselme
and
just
push
him
in
and
let
them
explain
matters
themselves
wo
it
be
a
moment
for
them
both
henry
writhed
yes
he
gasped
a
great
moment
and
you
are
not
going
to
care
one
bit
henry
moravia
went
on
with
authority
i
tell
you
you
are
not
then
having
made
all
clear
as
to
their
joint
action
upon
the
morrow
she
spent
the
last
half
hour
before
they
parted
in
instilling
into
his
spirit
every
sort
of
comfort
and
subtle
flattery
until
when
the
clock
struck
eleven
henry
felt
a
sense
of
regret
that
he
must
say
by
this
time
her
head
was
within
a
few
inches
of
his
shoulder
and
her
pretty
eyes
were
gazing
into
his
with
the
adoring
affection
of
a
child
you
are
an
absolute
darling
moravia
he
murmured
with
some
emotion
the
kindest
woman
in
this
world
and
he
bent
and
kissed
her
hair
she
showed
no
surprise
to
take
the
caress
naturally
would
she
felt
leave
him
with
the
pleasure
of
it
and
arouse
no
disturbing
analyzations
in
his
mind
as
to
its
meaning
now
you
have
got
to
go
right
off
to
your
little
bed
she
said
in
a
matter
of
fact
tone
and
i
should
just
like
to
come
and
tuck
you
up
and
turn
your
light
out
but
as
i
ca
you
promise
me
you
will
do
it
yourself
at
once
and
close
those
eyes
and
go
to
sleep
here
she
permitted
herself
softly
to
shut
his
lids
with
her
smooth
fingers
henry
felt
a
delicious
sense
of
comfort
and
peace
creeping
over
him
he
knew
he
did
not
wish
to
leave
her
but
he
got
up
and
took
both
her
hands
you
sweet
lady
he
said
you
will
never
know
how
your
kind
heart
has
helped
me
nor
can
i
express
my
gratitude
for
your
spontaneous
sympathy
with
which
he
kissed
the
fair
hands
and
went
regretfully
toward
the
door
moravia
thought
this
the
right
moment
to
show
a
little
further
sentiment
henry
she
faltered
it
has
been
rather
heaven
for
me
but
i
do
think
i
let
you
dine
up
here
alone
with
me
again
it
it
might
make
my
heart
ache
too
and
then
she
dexterously
glided
to
the
door
of
her
and
slipped
in
shutting
it
softly
and
henry
found
himself
alone
with
some
new
fire
running
in
his
veins
when
moravia
listening
heard
his
footsteps
going
down
the
passage
she
clasped
her
hands
in
glee
i
never
know
spontaneous
sympathy
oh
the
darling
innocent
babe
but
i
won
the
game
he
will
belong
to
me
now
and
i
shall
make
him
happy
ouida
was
most
certainly
right
when
she
said
are
not
vicious
they
are
but
children
chapter
xxiii
very
early
on
christmas
morning
lord
fordyce
went
down
to
the
and
walked
with
the
père
anselme
on
his
way
to
mass
he
had
come
to
a
conclusion
during
the
night
the
worthy
priest
would
be
the
more
fitting
person
to
see
michael
than
he
himself
he
felt
he
could
well
leave
all
explanations
in
those
able
hands
and
then
when
his
old
friend
knew
everything
he
henry
would
meet
him
and
bring
him
to
the
château
of
héronac
and
so
to
sabine
the
père
anselme
was
quite
willing
to
undertake
this
mission
he
would
have
returned
to
his
breakfast
by
then
and
would
await
arrival
he
told
henry
michael
would
come
from
the
station
twenty
kilometers
away
in
henry
motor
the
wind
had
got
up
and
a
gloriously
rough
sea
beat
itself
against
the
rocks
the
thundering
surf
seemed
some
comfort
to
henry
he
was
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
he
felt
very
much
better
than
he
had
ever
imagined
that
he
could
feel
after
such
a
blow
moravia
maneuvrings
and
sweet
sympathy
had
been
most
effective
and
henry
had
fallen
asleep
while
her
spell
was
still
upon
him
and
only
awakened
after
several
hours
of
refreshing
slumber
then
it
was
he
decided
upon
the
plan
which
he
put
into
execution
as
soon
as
daylight
came
now
he
left
the
old
priest
at
the
church
door
and
strode
away
along
the
rough
coast
road
battling
with
the
wind
and
trying
to
conquer
his
thoughts
he
was
following
moravia
advice
and
replacing
each
one
of
pain
as
it
came
with
one
of
pleasure
and
the
cold
air
exhilarated
his
blood
michael
meanwhile
in
the
slow
unpleasant
train
was
a
prey
to
anxiety
and
speculation
what
had
happened
there
was
no
clue
in
henry
dry
words
in
the
telegram
had
there
been
some
disaster
was
henry
violently
angry
with
him
what
would
their
meeting
bring
he
had
come
in
to
the
ritz
from
a
dinner
party
and
had
got
the
telegram
just
in
time
to
rush
straight
to
the
station
with
a
bag
and
get
into
an
train
and
all
night
long
he
had
wondered
and
wondered
as
he
sat
in
the
corner
of
his
carriage
but
whatever
had
happened
was
a
relief
it
produced
action
he
had
no
longer
just
to
try
to
kill
time
and
stifle
thought
he
could
do
something
for
good
or
ill
it
seemed
as
though
he
would
never
arrive
as
the
hours
wore
on
and
dawn
faded
into
daylight
then
at
last
the
crawling
engine
drew
up
at
his
destination
and
he
got
out
and
recognized
henry
chauffeur
waiting
for
him
on
the
platform
the
swift
rush
through
the
cold
air
refreshed
him
and
took
away
the
fatigue
of
the
long
night
and
soon
they
had
drawn
up
at
the
door
of
the
and
he
found
himself
being
shown
by
the
priest
ancient
housekeeper
into
the
spotlessly
clean
parlor
the
père
anselme
joined
him
in
a
moment
and
they
silently
shook
hands
you
are
not
aware
sir
why
you
have
been
sent
for
i
suppose
the
priest
asked
with
his
mild
courtesy
pray
be
seated
there
by
the
stove
and
i
will
endeavor
to
enlighten
you
michael
sat
down
please
tell
me
everything
he
said
the
père
anselme
spread
out
his
thin
hands
toward
the
warmth
of
the
china
while
he
remained
standing
opposite
his
visitor
the
good
god
at
last
put
it
into
the
mind
of
the
lord
fordyce
that
our
dame
has
not
been
altogether
happy
of
late
and
upon
my
suggestion
he
questioned
her
as
to
the
cause
of
this
and
learned
what
i
believe
to
be
the
truth
which
you
sir
can
corroborate
namely
that
you
are
her
husband
and
are
obtaining
the
divorce
not
from
desire
but
from
a
motive
of
loyalty
to
your
friend
that
is
the
case
assented
michael
quietly
a
sudden
great
joy
in
his
heart
the
priest
was
silent
so
he
went
on
and
what
does
lord
fordyce
mean
to
do
release
her
and
give
her
back
to
me
or
what
is
it
necessary
to
ask
and
père
anselme
lifted
questioning
and
almost
whimsical
eyebrows
surely
you
must
know
that
your
friend
is
a
gentleman
yes
i
know
that
but
it
must
mean
the
most
awful
suffering
to
him
poor
dear
old
henry
is
he
quite
knocked
out
the
good
god
tries
no
one
beyond
his
strength
he
will
find
consolation
but
meanwhile
it
will
be
well
that
you
let
me
offer
you
the
hospitality
of
my
poor
house
for
rest
and
refreshment
here
the
old
man
made
a
courtly
bow
and
when
you
have
eaten
and
perhaps
bathed
you
can
take
the
road
to
the
château
of
héronac
where
you
will
find
lord
fordyce
by
the
garden
wall
and
he
will
perhaps
take
you
to
madame
sabine
that
is
as
he
may
think
wisest
i
believe
she
is
quite
unprepared
of
the
reception
you
are
likely
to
receive
from
her
you
are
the
best
judge
yourself
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
cried
michael
suddenly
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
we
have
all
been
through
an
awful
time
so
it
would
seem
it
is
not
the
moment
for
me
to
tell
you
that
you
drew
it
all
upon
yourselves
since
the
good
god
has
seen
fit
to
restore
you
to
happiness
i
drew
it
upon
us
protested
michael
you
know
the
whole
story
father
the
old
priest
coughed
slightly
i
know
most
of
it
my
son
in
it
you
do
not
altogether
shine
michael
got
up
from
his
chair
while
he
clasped
his
hands
forcibly
no
indeed
i
do
not
i
know
i
have
been
an
unspeakable
brute
i
have
not
the
grain
of
an
excuse
to
offer
and
yet
she
has
forgiven
me
women
are
certainly
angels
are
they
not
the
curé
of
héronac
sighed
gently
angels
when
they
love
and
demons
when
they
hate
of
an
unbalance
but
a
great
charm
it
lies
with
us
men
to
decide
the
which
will
make
the
scale
go
either
way
with
them
to
heaven
or
hell
here
the
ancient
housekeeper
announced
that
coffee
and
rolls
were
ready
for
them
in
the
other
room
and
the
père
anselme
led
the
way
without
further
words
less
than
an
hour
later
the
two
men
who
loved
this
one
woman
met
just
over
the
causeway
where
henry
awaited
michael
coming
it
was
a
difficult
moment
for
them
both
but
they
clasped
hands
with
a
few
ordinary
words
henry
walk
in
the
wind
had
strengthened
his
nerves
for
some
reason
he
was
now
conscious
that
he
was
feeling
no
acute
pain
as
he
had
expected
that
he
would
do
and
that
there
was
even
some
kind
of
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
on
this
christmas
morning
he
was
able
to
bring
great
happiness
to
sabine
he
could
not
help
remarking
as
they
crossed
the
drawbridge
that
michael
looked
a
most
suitable
mate
for
her
he
was
such
a
picture
of
superb
health
and
youth
as
they
entered
the
courtyard
moravia
and
her
little
son
came
out
of
the
main
door
the
princess
greeted
them
gaily
she
was
going
to
show
girolamo
the
big
waves
from
the
causeway
bridge
before
going
on
to
church
they
had
a
good
she
experienced
no
surprise
at
seeing
michael
only
asking
about
his
night
journey
uncomfortableness
and
then
she
turned
to
henry
come
and
join
us
there
by
the
high
parapet
henry
as
soon
as
you
have
taken
arranstoun
up
to
sabine
she
has
not
come
out
of
her
wing
yet
but
i
know
that
she
is
dressed
and
in
her
and
smiling
merrily
she
took
girolamo
little
hand
and
went
her
way
there
was
no
sound
when
the
two
men
reached
sabine
door
henry
knocked
gently
but
no
answer
came
so
he
opened
it
and
looked
in
great
fires
burned
in
the
wide
chimneys
and
his
flowers
gave
forth
sweet
scent
but
the
lady
of
héronac
was
absent
or
so
it
seemed
come
in
michael
and
wait
henry
said
and
then
from
the
embrasure
of
the
far
window
they
heard
a
stifled
exclamation
and
saw
that
sabine
was
indeed
there
after
all
and
had
risen
from
the
floor
where
she
had
been
kneeling
by
the
looking
out
upon
the
waves
her
face
was
deadly
pale
and
showed
signs
of
a
night
vigil
but
when
she
caught
sight
of
michael
it
was
as
though
the
sun
had
emerged
from
a
cloud
so
radiant
grew
her
eyes
she
stood
quite
still
waiting
until
they
advanced
near
to
her
down
the
long
room
and
then
she
steadied
herself
against
the
back
of
a
tall
chair
sabine
henry
said
i
want
you
to
be
very
happy
on
this
christmas
day
and
so
i
have
brought
your
husband
back
to
you
all
these
foolish
divorce
proceedings
are
going
to
be
stopped
and
you
and
he
can
settle
all
your
differences
together
dear
then
as
a
glad
cry
forced
itself
from
sabine
lips
his
voice
broke
with
emotion
she
stretched
out
her
hands
to
him
and
he
took
one
and
drew
her
to
michael
who
stood
behind
him
then
he
took
also
his
old
friend
hand
and
clasped
it
upon
sabine
i
am
not
much
of
a
churchman
he
said
hoarsely
but
this
part
of
the
marriage
service
is
true
i
expect
whom
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
then
he
dropped
their
hands
and
turned
toward
the
door
oh
henry
you
are
so
good
to
us
sabine
cried
no
words
can
say
what
i
feel
but
lord
fordyce
could
bear
no
more
and
murmuring
some
kind
of
blessing
he
got
from
the
room
leaving
the
two
there
in
the
embrasure
of
the
great
window
gazing
into
each
other
eyes
as
the
door
shut
michael
spoke
at
last
sabine
my
own
he
whispered
and
held
out
his
arms
when
henry
left
sabine
he
staggered
down
the
stairs
like
one
blind
the
poignant
anguish
had
returned
and
the
mantle
of
comfort
fell
from
his
shoulders
he
was
human
after
all
and
the
picture
of
the
rapture
on
the
faces
of
the
two
showing
him
what
he
had
never
obtained
stabbed
him
like
a
knife
he
felt
that
he
would
willingly
drop
over
the
causeway
bridge
into
the
boiling
sea
and
finish
all
the
pain
he
saw
moravia
blue
velvet
dress
in
the
distance
down
the
road
when
he
left
the
lodge
gates
and
he
fled
into
the
garden
he
must
be
alone
but
she
had
seen
him
go
and
knew
that
another
crisis
had
come
and
that
she
must
conquer
this
time
also
so
apparently
only
for
the
gratification
of
girolamo
she
turned
and
entered
the
garden
the
garden
which
seemed
to
be
a
predestined
spot
for
the
stratagems
of
lovers
then
she
strolled
toward
the
not
turning
her
head
in
the
direction
where
she
plainly
perceived
henry
had
gone
but
taking
care
that
girolamo
should
see
him
as
she
knew
he
would
run
to
him
this
he
immediately
did
and
dragged
his
victim
back
to
his
mother
in
the
pavilion
which
looked
out
over
the
sea
girolamo
was
now
three
years
old
and
a
considerable
imp
he
displayed
henry
proudly
and
boasted
of
his
catch
while
moravia
scolded
him
sweetly
and
asked
henry
to
forgive
them
for
intruding
upon
his
solitude
you
know
i
understand
you
must
want
to
be
alone
dear
friend
and
i
would
not
have
come
if
i
had
seen
you
she
said
tenderly
while
she
turned
and
leaning
out
beckoned
to
the
nurse
whom
she
could
just
see
across
the
causeway
on
the
courtyard
wall
where
the
raised
parapet
was
then
allowing
her
feelings
to
overcome
her
judgment
she
flung
out
her
arms
and
seizing
henry
hands
she
drew
them
into
her
warm
huge
muff
henry
i
ca
help
it
she
gasped
it
breaks
my
heart
to
see
you
so
cold
and
white
and
numb
i
want
to
warm
and
comfort
and
love
you
back
to
life
again
at
this
minute
the
sun
burst
through
the
scudding
clouds
and
blazed
in
upon
them
from
the
archway
and
it
seemed
to
henry
as
if
a
new
vitality
rushed
into
his
frozen
veins
she
was
so
human
and
pretty
and
young
and
real
love
for
him
spoke
from
her
sparkling
brown
eyes
the
ascendancy
she
had
obtained
over
him
on
the
previous
evening
returned
in
a
measure
he
no
longer
wanted
to
get
away
from
her
and
be
alone
he
made
some
murmuring
reply
and
did
not
seek
to
draw
away
his
hands
but
a
sudden
change
of
feeling
seemed
to
come
over
moravia
for
she
lowered
her
head
and
a
deep
pink
flush
grew
in
her
cheeks
what
will
you
think
of
me
henry
she
whispered
pulling
at
his
grasp
which
grew
firmer
as
she
tried
to
loosen
it
i
and
then
she
raised
her
eyes
which
were
suffused
with
tears
oh
it
seems
such
horrid
waste
for
you
to
be
sick
with
grief
for
sabine
who
is
happy
now
and
that
only
i
must
grieve
girolamo
had
seen
his
nurse
entering
the
far
gate
and
was
racing
off
to
meet
her
so
that
they
were
quite
alone
in
the
pavilion
now
and
moravia
words
and
the
tears
in
her
fond
eyes
had
a
tremendous
effect
upon
henry
it
moved
some
unknown
cloud
in
his
emotions
she
too
wanted
comfort
not
he
alone
and
he
could
bring
it
to
her
and
be
soothed
in
return
so
he
drew
her
closer
and
closer
to
him
and
framed
her
face
in
his
hands
moravia
he
said
tenderly
you
shall
not
grieve
dear
child
if
you
want
me
take
me
and
i
will
give
you
all
the
devotion
of
true
friendship
and
who
knows
perhaps
we
shall
find
the
indian
summer
after
all
now
that
the
gates
of
my
fool
paradise
are
shut
in
the
abstract
it
was
not
highly
gratifying
to
a
woman
vanity
this
declaration
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
beyond
moravia
wildest
hopes
she
had
not
a
single
doubt
in
her
astute
american
mind
that
once
she
should
have
the
right
to
the
society
of
henry
with
her
knowledge
of
the
ways
of
man
that
she
would
soon
be
able
to
obliterate
all
regrets
for
sabine
and
draw
his
affections
completely
to
herself
at
this
juncture
she
showed
a
stroke
of
genius
henry
she
said
her
voice
vibrating
with
profound
feeling
i
do
want
you
more
than
anything
i
have
ever
wanted
in
my
life
and
i
will
make
you
forget
all
your
hurts
in
my
arms
there
was
certainly
nothing
left
for
lord
fordyce
being
a
gallant
gentleman
to
do
but
to
stoop
his
tall
head
and
kiss
her
and
to
his
surprise
he
found
this
duty
turn
into
a
pleasure
so
that
in
a
few
moments
when
they
were
close
together
looking
out
upon
the
waves
through
the
pavilion
wide
windows
he
encircled
her
with
his
arm
and
then
he
burst
into
a
laugh
but
though
it
was
cynical
it
contained
no
bitterness
moravia
you
are
a
witch
he
told
her
here
is
a
situation
that
described
would
read
like
pathos
and
yet
it
has
made
us
both
happy
half
an
hour
ago
i
was
wishing
i
might
step
over
into
that
foam
and
now
and
now
demanded
the
princess
standing
from
him
and
now
i
realize
that
with
the
new
year
there
may
dawn
new
joys
for
me
oh
my
dear
if
you
will
be
content
with
what
i
can
give
you
let
us
be
married
soon
and
go
to
india
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
the
père
anselme
noticed
that
his
only
congregation
from
the
château
consisted
of
cloudwater
and
madame
imogen
and
he
thanked
the
good
god
as
he
sent
up
a
fervent
prayer
for
the
absentees
happiness
it
means
that
they
two
are
near
heaven
and
that
consolation
will
come
to
the
disconsolate
one
since
all
four
remain
at
home
he
told
himself
this
was
a
dénouement
worthy
of
christmas
day
and
of
far
more
value
in
his
eyes
than
the
two
pairs
mere
presence
in
his
church
the
ways
of
the
good
god
are
marvellous
he
mused
as
he
went
to
his
vestry
and
it
is
fitting
that
youth
should
find
its
mate
we
grieve
and
wring
our
hearts
and
nothing
is
final
and
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
that
love
may
bloom
again
peace
be
with
them
chapter
xxiv
when
the
first
moment
of
ecstasy
in
the
knowledge
that
they
were
indeed
given
back
to
each
other
was
over
michael
drew
sabine
to
the
window
seat
where
she
had
been
crouching
only
that
short
while
before
in
silent
misery
sweetheart
he
entreated
now
you
have
got
to
tell
me
everything
do
you
understand
sabine
every
single
thing
from
the
first
moment
in
the
chapel
when
we
made
those
vows
until
now
when
we
are
going
to
keep
them
i
want
to
know
everything
darling
child
all
your
thoughts
and
what
you
did
with
your
life
and
when
you
hated
me
and
when
you
loved
me
they
sat
down
on
the
velvet
cushions
and
sabine
nestled
into
his
arms
it
is
so
difficult
michael
she
cooed
how
can
i
begin
i
was
sillier
and
more
ignorant
than
any
other
girl
of
seventeen
could
possibly
be
i
think
do
you
oh
do
let
us
speak
of
that
part
i
only
remember
that
when
you
kissed
me
first
in
the
chapel
some
kind
of
strange
emotion
came
to
me
then
i
was
frightened
but
not
after
a
while
he
interpolated
something
of
rapturous
triumph
in
his
fond
glance
while
he
caressed
and
smoothed
her
hair
as
her
little
head
lay
against
his
shoulder
i
thought
you
had
forgiven
me
before
i
went
to
sleep
perhaps
i
had
i
did
not
know
myself
only
that
there
in
the
gray
dawn
everything
seemed
perfectly
awful
and
horror
and
terror
came
upon
me
again
and
i
had
only
one
wild
impulse
to
rush
away
surely
you
can
understand
she
paused
go
on
sweetheart
he
commanded
i
shall
not
let
you
off
one
detail
i
love
to
make
you
tell
me
every
single
thing
and
he
took
her
hand
and
played
with
her
wedding
ring
but
not
taking
it
off
while
sabine
thrilled
with
happiness
well
you
did
not
wake
and
so
presently
i
got
into
the
and
at
last
found
the
certificate
and
just
as
i
was
going
out
of
the
door
on
to
the
balcony
i
heard
you
call
my
name
sleepily
and
for
one
second
i
nearly
went
back
but
i
did
not
and
got
safely
away
and
to
the
hotel
think
of
my
not
waking
michael
exclaimed
if
only
i
had
you
would
never
have
been
allowed
to
go
it
is
maddening
to
remember
what
that
sleep
cost
but
how
did
you
manage
at
the
hotel
it
was
after
five
and
the
side
door
was
open
into
the
yard
not
a
soul
saw
me
and
i
carried
out
my
original
plan
i
think
when
i
was
in
the
train
i
had
already
begun
to
regret
bitterly
but
it
was
too
late
to
go
back
and
then
next
day
your
letter
came
to
me
at
parsons
and
all
my
pride
was
up
in
arms
here
michael
held
her
very
tight
oh
what
a
brute
i
was
to
write
that
letter
he
cried
all
i
wanted
then
was
to
go
away
and
forget
all
about
you
and
everything
and
have
lots
of
nice
clothes
and
join
my
friend
moravia
in
paris
you
see
i
was
still
just
a
silly
ignorant
child
parsons
got
me
a
good
maid
who
is
with
me
still
and
he
agreed
at
last
to
my
taking
the
name
of
howard
i
thought
if
i
kept
the
arranstoun
everyone
would
know
but
what
did
you
intend
to
do
darling
with
your
life
we
were
both
crazy
of
course
you
to
go
and
i
to
let
you
i
had
no
concrete
idea
just
to
see
the
world
and
buy
what
i
wanted
and
sit
up
late
and
not
have
to
obey
any
rules
i
think
and
underneath
there
was
a
great
excitement
all
the
time
in
the
thought
of
looking
perfectly
splendid
in
being
a
grand
lady
when
you
came
back
for
of
course
i
believed
then
that
we
must
meet
again
well
what
changed
all
that
and
made
you
become
engaged
to
henry
you
wicked
little
thing
and
michael
kissed
her
fondly
was
it
because
i
did
not
come
back
but
you
could
have
cabled
to
me
at
any
time
an
enchanting
confusion
crept
over
sabine
she
hesitated
she
began
to
speak
then
stopped
and
finally
buried
her
face
in
his
coat
what
is
it
darling
he
asked
with
almost
a
tone
of
anxiety
in
his
voice
did
you
have
some
violent
flirtation
with
someone
at
this
stage
and
you
think
i
shall
be
annoyed
but
indeed
i
shall
not
because
i
do
fully
realize
that
whatever
you
did
was
my
fault
for
leaving
you
alone
tell
me
sabine
you
sweet
child
no
it
was
that
well
then
well
then
i
was
terrified
it
was
my
old
maid
simone
who
told
me
what
had
happened
i
was
still
too
ignorant
to
understand
things
told
you
what
what
wretched
story
did
the
old
woman
invent
about
me
michael
eyes
were
haughty
that
she
could
listen
to
stories
from
a
maid
sabine
clasped
her
hands
together
she
was
deeply
moved
oh
michael
you
are
stupid
how
can
i
possibly
tell
you
if
you
understand
then
she
jumped
up
suddenly
and
swiftly
brought
her
box
from
beside
her
and
unlocked
it
with
her
bracelet
key
while
michael
with
an
anxious
puzzled
face
watched
her
intently
she
sat
down
again
beside
him
when
she
had
found
what
she
sought
the
closed
blue
leather
case
which
she
had
looked
at
so
many
times
if
you
are
going
to
show
me
some
brute
photograph
i
simply
refuse
to
look
michael
said
all
that
part
of
your
life
is
over
and
we
are
going
to
begin
afresh
darling
one
no
matter
what
you
did
but
she
crept
nearer
to
him
as
she
opened
the
case
and
her
voice
was
full
and
sweet
shy
tenderness
as
she
blurted
out
it
is
not
a
brute
photograph
michael
it
is
the
picture
of
your
own
little
son
my
god
cried
michael
the
sudden
violent
emotion
making
him
very
pale
sabine
how
dared
you
keep
this
from
me
all
these
years
i
then
he
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
for
a
few
seconds
they
could
neither
of
them
speak
his
caresses
were
so
fierce
at
last
he
exclaimed
brokenly
sabine
with
the
knowledge
of
this
between
us
how
could
you
ever
have
even
contemplated
belonging
to
another
man
oh
if
i
had
only
known
where
is
my
son
you
must
listen
michael
to
everything
sabine
whispered
then
you
will
understand
i
was
simply
terrified
when
i
realized
at
last
and
only
wanted
to
go
back
to
you
and
be
comforted
so
i
wrote
a
letter
at
once
to
tell
you
and
as
parsons
was
in
england
again
i
sent
it
to
him
to
have
it
put
safely
into
your
hands
but
by
then
you
had
gone
right
off
to
china
and
parsons
sent
the
letter
back
to
me
it
was
useless
to
forward
it
to
you
he
said
you
might
not
get
it
for
a
year
michael
strained
her
to
his
heart
once
more
while
his
eyes
grew
wet
oh
my
poor
little
girl
all
alone
how
frightfully
cruel
it
was
no
wonder
you
hated
me
then
and
could
not
forgive
me
even
afterward
i
did
not
hate
you
i
was
only
terrified
and
longing
to
rush
off
somewhere
and
hide
so
simone
suggested
san
francisco
the
furthest
off
she
knew
and
we
hurried
over
there
and
then
i
was
awfully
ill
and
when
my
baby
was
born
i
very
nearly
died
michael
was
wordless
he
could
only
kiss
her
that
is
what
made
him
so
delicate
my
wretchedness
and
rushing
about
she
went
on
and
so
i
was
punished
because
after
three
months
god
took
him
back
again
my
dear
little
one
just
when
i
was
beginning
to
grow
comforted
and
to
love
him
he
was
exactly
like
you
michael
with
the
same
blue
eyes
and
i
thought
i
thought
we
should
go
back
to
arranstoun
and
finish
our
estrangements
and
be
happy
again
the
three
of
us
when
you
did
come
home
i
grew
radiant
and
quite
well
here
two
big
tears
gathered
in
her
violet
eyes
and
fell
upon
michael
hand
and
he
shivered
with
the
intensity
of
his
feelings
as
he
held
her
close
we
had
made
our
plans
to
go
east
but
my
little
sweetheart
caught
cold
somehow
and
then
he
died
oh
i
ca
tell
you
the
grief
of
it
michael
i
was
quite
reckless
after
that
it
was
in
june
and
i
did
not
care
what
happened
to
me
for
a
long
while
i
just
wanted
to
get
back
to
moravia
not
knowing
she
had
left
paris
for
rome
and
then
i
crossed
in
july
and
came
here
to
brittany
and
saw
and
bought
héronac
as
i
told
you
before
i
heard
then
that
you
had
not
returned
from
china
or
made
any
sign
and
it
seemed
all
so
cruel
and
ruthless
and
as
there
were
no
longer
any
ties
between
us
i
thought
that
i
would
crush
you
from
my
life
and
forget
you
and
that
i
would
educate
myself
and
make
something
of
my
mind
oh
my
dear
my
dear
little
girl
michael
sighed
if
you
knew
how
all
this
is
cutting
me
to
the
heart
to
think
of
the
awful
brute
i
have
been
to
think
of
you
bearing
things
all
alone
i
somehow
never
realized
the
possibility
of
this
happening
but
once
or
twice
when
it
did
cross
my
mind
i
thought
of
course
you
would
have
cabled
to
me
if
so
i
am
simply
appalled
now
at
the
casual
selfishness
of
my
behavior
can
you
ever
forgive
me
sabine
she
smoothed
back
his
dark
thick
hair
and
looked
into
his
bold
eyes
now
soft
and
glistening
with
tears
of
course
i
can
forgive
you
michael
i
belong
to
you
you
see
so
when
he
had
kissed
her
enough
in
gratitude
and
contrition
he
besought
her
to
go
on
the
years
passed
and
i
thought
i
had
really
forgotten
you
and
my
life
grew
so
peaceful
with
the
père
anselme
and
madame
imogen
here
at
héronac
and
all
sorts
of
wonderful
and
interesting
studies
kept
developing
for
me
i
seemed
to
grow
up
and
realize
things
and
the
memory
of
you
grew
less
and
less
but
society
never
held
out
any
attractions
for
me
only
to
be
with
moravia
i
had
taken
almost
a
loathing
for
men
their
actions
seemed
to
me
all
cruel
and
predatory
not
a
single
one
attracted
me
in
the
least
degree
until
this
summer
at
carlsbad
when
we
met
henry
and
he
appeared
so
good
and
true
and
kind
and
i
felt
he
could
lift
me
to
noble
things
and
give
me
a
guiding
hand
to
greatness
of
purpose
in
life
i
liked
him
but
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
michael
and
you
will
see
how
small
i
am
here
she
held
tightly
to
michael
hand
i
do
not
think
i
would
ever
have
promised
him
at
carlsbad
that
i
would
try
to
free
myself
only
that
i
read
in
the
paper
that
you
were
at
ostende
with
daisy
van
der
horn
that
exasperated
me
even
though
i
thought
i
was
absolutely
indifferent
to
you
after
five
years
i
had
never
seen
your
name
in
the
paper
before
it
was
the
first
indication
i
had
had
that
you
had
come
home
and
the
whole
thing
wounded
my
pride
i
felt
that
i
must
ask
for
my
freedom
from
you
before
you
possibly
could
ask
for
yours
from
me
so
i
told
henry
that
very
night
that
i
had
made
up
my
mind
oh
you
dear
little
goose
michael
interrupted
not
one
of
those
ladies
mattered
to
me
more
than
the
other
they
were
merely
to
pass
the
time
of
day
of
no
importance
whatever
i
dare
say
but
i
am
telling
you
my
story
michael
well
henry
was
so
wonderful
so
good
and
it
got
so
that
he
seemed
to
mean
everything
fine
he
drew
me
out
of
myself
and
your
shadow
grew
to
mean
less
and
less
to
me
and
i
believed
that
i
had
forgotten
you
quite
except
for
the
irritation
i
felt
about
daisy
and
then
by
that
extraordinary
turn
of
fate
henry
himself
brought
you
here
and
i
did
not
even
know
the
name
of
the
friend
who
was
coming
with
him
he
had
not
told
me
in
the
hurried
postscript
of
his
letter
saying
he
was
bringing
some
one
i
saw
you
both
arrive
from
the
lodge
and
when
i
heard
the
tones
of
your
voice
ah
well
you
can
imagine
what
it
meant
no
i
want
to
know
little
darling
what
did
it
mean
and
michael
looked
into
her
eyes
with
fond
command
it
made
my
heart
beat
and
my
knees
tremble
and
a
strange
thrill
came
over
me
i
ought
to
have
known
then
that
to
feel
like
that
did
not
mean
indifference
ought
i
i
expect
so
but
what
a
moment
it
was
when
we
did
meet
you
must
come
to
that
arrogant
darling
creature
you
are
michael
you
love
to
make
me
recount
all
these
things
and
sabine
looked
so
sweetly
mutinous
that
he
could
not
remain
tranquilly
listening
for
the
moment
but
had
to
make
passionate
love
to
her
whispering
every
sort
of
endearment
into
her
little
ear
though
presently
she
continued
the
recital
of
her
story
again
i
stood
there
in
the
lodge
after
the
shock
of
seeing
you
had
passed
and
i
began
to
burn
with
every
sort
of
resentment
against
you
i
had
had
all
the
suffering
and
you
had
gone
free
and
i
just
felt
i
wanted
to
punish
you
by
pretending
not
to
know
you
think
of
it
how
small
and
yet
there
underneath
i
felt
your
old
horribly
powerful
charm
oh
you
did
did
you
you
darling
michael
exclaimed
and
what
do
you
suppose
i
felt
if
we
had
only
rushed
there
and
then
into
each
arms
i
was
quite
prepared
for
you
in
the
garden
and
did
not
i
play
my
part
well
you
got
quite
white
you
know
with
surprise
and
i
felt
exquisitely
excited
i
could
see
you
had
come
in
all
innocence
having
probably
forgotten
our
joking
arrangement
that
i
should
call
myself
howard
i
could
not
think
why
you
did
not
speak
out
and
denounce
me
it
hurt
my
pride
i
thought
it
was
because
you
wanted
to
divorce
me
and
marry
daisy
that
you
were
indifferent
about
it
i
did
not
know
it
was
because
you
had
given
your
word
of
honor
to
henry
not
to
interfere
with
the
woman
he
loved
then
after
dinner
henry
told
me
you
knew
that
he
and
i
were
practically
engaged
that
stung
me
deeply
it
seemed
to
prove
your
indifference
so
things
developed
and
we
met
in
the
garden
michael
was
not
that
a
wonderful
hour
how
we
both
acted
if
you
had
indicated
by
word
or
look
that
you
remembered
me
i
could
not
have
kept
it
up
we
should
have
had
to
tell
henry
then
we
were
playing
at
and
my
pride
was
wounded
i
understand
sweetheart
go
on
well
i
was
miserable
at
luncheon
and
then
when
you
went
out
in
the
boat
being
with
you
was
like
some
intoxicating
drink
i
was
more
excited
than
i
had
ever
been
in
my
life
i
was
horrid
toward
henry
i
would
not
own
it
to
myself
but
i
felt
him
to
be
the
stumbling
block
in
the
way
so
i
was
extra
nice
to
him
to
convince
myself
and
i
let
him
hold
my
arm
which
i
had
never
done
before
and
you
saw
that
in
the
garden
i
suppose
and
thought
i
loved
him
and
so
went
that
was
nice
of
you
michael
but
stupid
was
it
ridiculously
stupid
everything
i
did
was
stupid
that
separated
you
from
me
the
natural
action
of
my
character
would
have
been
just
to
seize
you
again
and
carry
you
off
resisting
or
unresisting
to
arranstoun
but
some
idiotic
sentiment
of
honor
to
henry
held
me
i
cried
a
little
i
believe
when
i
got
your
note
i
went
up
into
this
room
and
opened
this
and
read
your
horrid
letter
again
and
i
believe
i
looked
into
the
blue
leather
case
too
here
she
opened
it
once
more
and
they
both
examined
it
tenderly
of
course
you
ca
see
anything
much
in
this
little
photograph
but
he
really
was
so
like
you
michael
and
when
i
looked
at
it
again
after
seeing
you
i
could
have
sobbed
aloud
i
wanted
you
so
my
dear
dear
little
girl
henry
had
told
me
casually
that
afternoon
your
story
and
how
he
had
not
stayed
at
arranstoun
for
the
wedding
because
he
thought
your
action
so
unfair
to
the
bride
and
how
that
now
you
felt
rather
a
dog
in
the
manger
about
her
that
infuriated
me
ca
you
understand
i
had
only
one
desire
to
show
you
that
i
did
not
care
since
you
had
gone
off
henry
was
simply
angelic
to
me
and
asked
me
so
seriously
if
he
could
really
make
me
happy
if
not
he
would
release
me
then
i
felt
if
he
would
take
me
all
bruised
and
restless
and
comfort
me
and
bring
me
peace
i
did
indeed
wish
to
be
his
wife
and
if
nothing
more
had
happened
we
might
have
grown
quite
happy
from
then
but
we
went
to
england
and
i
saw
you
again
and
oh
well
michael
need
i
tell
you
any
more
you
know
how
we
fenced
and
how
at
last
we
could
not
bear
it
up
in
forster
room
it
was
the
most
delirious
and
most
unhappy
moment
of
my
life
darling
and
now
it
is
all
over
is
henry
a
splendid
man
i
told
him
all
this
yesterday
the
père
anselme
had
suggested
to
him
to
come
and
ask
me
for
the
truth
he
behaved
too
nobly
but
i
did
not
know
what
he
intended
to
do
nor
if
it
were
too
late
to
stop
the
divorce
or
anything
so
i
was
miserable
you
shall
not
be
so
any
more
we
will
go
back
to
arranstoun
at
once
darling
and
begin
a
new
and
glorious
life
together
from
every
point
of
view
that
is
the
best
thing
to
be
done
we
could
not
possibly
go
on
all
staying
here
it
would
be
grotesque
and
i
am
quite
determined
that
i
will
never
leave
you
again
do
you
hear
sabine
and
he
turned
her
face
and
made
her
look
into
his
eyes
yes
i
hear
and
know
that
you
were
always
the
most
masterful
creature
do
you
want
to
change
me
but
sabine
let
herself
be
clasped
in
his
arms
while
she
abandoned
herself
to
the
deep
passionate
joy
she
felt
no
michael
i
would
not
alter
you
in
one
little
bit
we
are
neither
of
us
very
good
or
very
clever
but
i
just
love
you
and
you
love
me
and
we
are
mates
there
they
carried
out
their
plans
and
arrived
at
arranstoun
castle
a
few
days
later
michael
wired
to
have
everything
ready
for
their
reception
and
both
experienced
the
most
profound
emotion
when
first
they
entered
michael
again
there
is
the
picture
darling
that
you
fell
through
and
here
is
binko
waiting
to
receive
and
welcome
you
the
mass
of
fat
wrinkles
got
up
from
his
basket
and
condescended
after
showing
a
wild
but
suppressed
joy
at
the
sight
of
his
master
to
be
to
his
mistress
who
expressed
due
appreciation
of
his
beauty
that
old
dog
has
been
my
only
confidant
about
you
sabine
ever
since
i
came
back
he
could
tell
you
how
frantic
i
was
could
you
binko
binko
slobbered
his
acquiescence
and
then
the
tea
was
brought
in
sabine
sat
down
to
pour
it
out
in
the
very
chair
she
had
sat
in
long
ago
she
was
taller
now
but
still
her
little
feet
did
not
reach
the
ground
the
most
ecstatic
happiness
was
permeating
them
both
and
it
all
seemed
like
a
divine
dream
to
be
there
together
and
alone
they
reconstructed
every
incident
of
their
first
meeting
in
a
fond
duet
each
supplying
a
link
and
they
talked
of
all
their
new
existence
together
and
what
it
would
mean
and
presently
michael
drew
sabine
toward
the
chapel
where
the
lights
were
all
lit
darling
he
whispered
i
want
to
make
new
vows
of
love
and
tenderness
to
you
here
because
is
our
real
wedding
night
i
want
you
to
forget
that
other
one
and
blot
it
right
out
but
sabine
moved
very
close
to
him
as
she
clung
to
his
arm
and
her
whole
soul
was
in
her
eyes
as
she
answered
i
do
not
want
to
forget
it
i
know
very
well
that
i
had
begun
to
love
you
even
then
but
michael
do
you
remember
that
undecorated
window
which
you
told
me
had
been
left
so
probably
for
you
to
embellish
as
an
expiatory
offering
because
rapine
and
violence
were
in
the
blood
well
dear
love
i
think
we
must
put
up
the
most
beautiful
stained
glass
together
there
in
memory
of
our
little
son
for
we
are
equally
to
blame
for
his
brief
life
and
death
but
michael
was
too
moved
to
speak
and
could
only
clasp
her
hand
the
end
