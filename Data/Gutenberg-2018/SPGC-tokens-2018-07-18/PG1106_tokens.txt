aaron
for

be

perforce
accomplish

you
may
take
this

lucrece
was
not

bassianus
love
a

i

found
the

my

a
solemn
hunting
is
in

there
will
the
lovely
roman
ladies
troop
the

walks
are
wide

spacious
and
many
unfrequented
plots
there
are
fitted
by
kind
for
rape
and
villainy
single
you
thither
then
this
dainty
doe
and
strike
her
home
by
force
if
not
by

this

not

stand
you

come
come
our

to

and
vengeance
consecrate
will
we
acquaint

she
shall
file
our

with
advice
that
will
not
suffer
you
to
square
yourselves
but
to
your

height
advance

detested
vale
you

forlorn

overcome
with
moss
and
baleful
mistletoe
here
never
shines
the
sun
here
nothing
breeds
unless
the
nightly
owl
or
fatal
raven
and
when
they
show
me
this
abhorred
pit
they
told
me
here
at
dead
time
of
the
night
a
thousand
fiends
a
thousand
hissing
snakes
ten
thousand
swelling
toads
as
many

such
fearful
and
confused
cries
as
any
mortal
body
hearing
it
should
straight
fall
mad
or
else
die
suddenly
no
sooner
had
they
told
this
hellish
tale
but
straight
they
told
me
they
would
bind
me
here
unto
the
body
of
a
dismal
yew
and
leave
me
to
this
miserable
death
and
then
they
call
me
foul
adulteress
lascivious
goth
and
all
the
bitterest
terms
that
ever
ear
did
hear
to
such
effect
and
had
you
not
by
wondrous
fortune
come
this
vengeance
on
me
had
they
executed
revenge

as
you
love
your

doth

like
a
taper
in

monument
doth
shine
upon
the
dead
man

shows
the
ragged
entrails

pitiful
to
my

lucius
o
noble
father
you
lament
in

the
tribunes
hear
you
not
no

is
by
and
you
recount
your
sorrows
to
a
stone
titus
ah
lucius
for
thy

let
me
plead
grave
tribunes
once
more
i
entreat
of
you
lucius
my
gracious
lord
no
tribune
hears
you
speak
titus
why
is
no
matter
man
if
they
did
hear
they
would
not
mark
me
if
they
did
mark
they
would
not
pity
me
yet
plead
i
must
and
bootless
unto
them
therefore
i
tell
my
sorrows
to
the
stones
who
though
they
can
not
answer
my
distress
yet
in
some
sort
they
are
better
than
the
tribunes
for
that
they
will
not
intercept
my
tale
when
i
do
weep
they
humbly
at
my
feet
receive
my
tears
and
seem
to
weep
with
me
and
were
they
but
attired
in
grave
weeds
rome
could
afford
no
tribunes
like
to
these
a
stone
is
soft
as
wax
tribunes
more
hard
than
stones
a
stone
is
silent
and
offendeth
not
and
tribunes
with
their
tongues
doom
men
to
death
rises
but
wherefore
thou
with
thy
weapon
drawn
lucius
to
rescue
my
two
brothers
from
their
death
for
which
attempt
the
judges
have
my
everlasting
doom
of
banishment
titus
o
happy
man
they
have
befriended
thee
why
foolish
lucius
dost
thou
not
perceive
that
rome
is
but
a
wilderness
of
tigers
tigers
must
prey
and
rome
affords
no
prey
but
me
and
mine
how
happy
art
thou
then
from
these
devourers
to
be
banished
but
who
comes
with
our
brother
marcus
here
enter
marcus
with
lavinia
marcus
titus
prepare
thy
aged
eyes
to
weep
or
if
not
so
thy
noble
heart
to
break
i
bring
consuming
sorrow
to
thine
age
titus
will
it
consume
me
let
me
see
it
then
marcus
this
was
thy
daughter
titus
why
marcus
so
she
is
lucius
ay
me
this
object
kills
me
titus
boy
arise
and
look
upon
her
speak
lavinia
what
accursed
hand
hath
made
thee
handless
in
thy
father
sight
what
fool
hath
added
water
to
the
sea
or
brought
a
fagot
to
troy
my
grief
was
at
the
height
before
thou
and
now
like
nilus
it
disdaineth
bounds
give
me
a
sword
i
chop
off
my
hands
too
for
they
have
fought
for
rome
and
all
in
vain
and
they
have
nurs
this
woe
in
feeding
life
in
bootless
prayer
have
they
been
held
up
and
they
have
serv
me
to
effectless
use
now
all
the
service
i
require
of
them
is
that
the
one
will
help
to
cut
the
other
is
well
lavinia
that
thou
hast
no
hands
for
hands
to
do
rome
service
is
but
vain
lucius
speak
gentle
sister
who
hath
martyr
thee
marcus
o
that
delightful
engine
of
her
thoughts
that
blabb
them
with
such
pleasing
eloquence
is
torn
from
forth
that
pretty
hollow
cage
where
like
a
sweet
melodious
bird
it
sung
sweet
varied
notes
enchanting
every
ear
lucius
o
say
thou
for
her
who
hath
done
this
deed
marcus
o
thus
i
found
her
straying
in
the
park
seeking
to
hide
herself
as
doth
the
deer
that
hath
receiv
some
unrecuring
wound
titus
it
was
my
dear
and
he
that
wounded
her
hath
hurt
me
more
than
had
he
kill
me
dead
for
now
i
stand
as
one
upon
a
rock
environ
with
a
wilderness
of
sea
who
marks
the
waxing
tide
grow
wave
by
wave
expecting
ever
when
some
envious
surge
will
in
his
brinish
bowels
swallow
him
this
way
to
death
my
wretched
sons
are
gone
here
stands
my
other
son
a
banish
man
and
here
my
brother
weeping
at
my
woes
but
that
which
gives
my
soul
the
greatest
spurn
is
dear
lavinia
dearer
than
my
soul
had
i
but
seen
thy
picture
in
this
plight
it
would
have
madded
me
what
shall
i
do
now
i
behold
thy
lively
body
so
thou
hast
no
hands
to
wipe
away
thy
tears
nor
tongue
to
tell
me
who
hath
martyr
thee
thy
husband
he
is
dead
and
for
his
death
thy
brothers
are
condemn
and
dead
by
this
look
marcus
ah
son
lucius
look
on
her
when
i
did
name
her
brothers
then
fresh
tears
stood
on
her
cheeks
as
doth
the
honey
dew
upon
a
lily
almost
withered
marcus
perchance
she
weeps
because
they
kill
her
husband
perchance
because
she
knows
them
innocent
titus
if
they
did
kill
thy
husband
then
be
joyful
because
the
law
hath
revenge
on
them
no
no
they
would
not
do
so
foul
a
deed
witness
the
sorrow
that
their
sister
makes
gentle
lavinia
let
me
kiss
thy
lips
or
make
some
sign
how
i
may
do
thee
ease
shall
thy
good
uncle
and
thy
brother
lucius
and
thou
and
i
sit
round
about
some
fountain
looking
all
downwards
to
behold
our
cheeks
how
they
are
stain
like
meadows
yet
not
dry
with
miry
slime
left
on
them
by
a
flood
and
in
the
fountain
shall
we
gaze
so
long
till
the
fresh
taste
be
taken
from
that
clearness
and
made
a
with
our
bitter
tears
or
shall
we
cut
away
our
hands
like
thine
or
shall
we
bite
our
tongues
and
in
dumb
shows
pass
the
remainder
of
our
hateful
days
what
shall
we
do
let
us
that
have
our
tongues
plot
some
device
of
further
misery
to
make
us
wonder
at
in
time
to
come
lucius
sweet
father
cease
your
tears
for
at
your
grief

how
my
wretched
sister

i
said
to
thee
his
napkin
with
his
true
tears
all

do
no
service
on
her
sorrowful
cheeks
o

a
sympathy
of

from
bliss

thine

enemies

not
be
sent
my
hand

serve
the
turn
my
youth

therefore
mine
shall
save
my
brothers
lives

warded
him
from
thousand
dangers
bid

more
hath
it
that
let
it
have
as
for
my
sons
say
i
account
of
them
as
jewels
purchas
at
an
easy
price
and
yet
dear
too
because
i
bought
mine
own
aaron
i
go
andronicus
and
for
thy
hand
look
by
and
by
to
have
thy
sons
with
thee
aside
their
heads
i
mean
o
how
this
villainy
doth
fat
me
with
the
very
thoughts
of
it
let
fools
do
good
and
fair
men
call
for
grace
aaron
will
have
his
soul
black
like
his
face
exit
titus
o
here
i
lift
this
one
hand
up
to
heaven
and
bow
this
feeble
ruin
to
the
earth
if
any
power
pities
wretched
tears
to
that
i
call
to
lavinia
what
thou
kneel
with
me
do
then
dear
heart
for
heaven
shall
hear
our
prayers
or
with
our
sighs
we
breathe
the
welkin
dim
and
stain
the
sun
with
fog
as
sometime
clouds
when
they
do
hug
him
in
their
melting
bosoms
marcus
o
brother
speak
with
possibility
and
do
not
break
into
these
deep
extremes
titus
is
not
my
sorrow
deep
having
no
bottom
then
be
my
passions
bottomless
with
them
marcus
but
yet
let
reason
govern
thy
lament
titus
if
there
were
reason
for
these
miseries
then
into
limits
could
i
bind
my
woes
when
heaven
doth
weep
doth
not
the
earth
if
the
winds
rage
doth
not
the
sea
wax
mad
the
welkin
with
his
face
and
wilt
thou
have
a
reason
for
this
coil
i
am
the
sea
hark
how
her
sighs
do
blow
she
is
the
weeping
welkin
i
the
earth
then
must
my
sea
be
moved
with
her
sighs
then
must
my
earth
with
her
continual
tears
become
a
deluge
overflow
and
drown
for
why
my
bowels
can
not
hide
her
woes
but
like
a
drunkard
must
i
vomit
them
then
give
me
leave
for

have
leave
to

their
stomachs
with
their
bitter
tongues
enter
a

with
two

messenger
worthy

ill

thou
repaid
for
that
good
hand
thou
the

of
thy
two
noble

here
thy
hand
in
scorn
to
thee
sent
thy
grief
their

my

an
hell
these
miseries
are
more
than
may
be
borne
to
weep
with
them
that
weep
doth
ease
some
deal
but
sorrow
flouted
at
is
double
death
lucius
ah
that
this
sight
should
make
so
deep
a
wound
and
yet
detested
life
not
shrink
thereat
that
ever
death
should
let
life
bear
his
name
where
life
hath
no
more
interest
but
to
breathe
lavinia
kisses
titus
marcus
alas
poor
heart
that
kiss
is
comfortless
as
frozen
water
to
a
starved
snake
titus
when
will
this
fearful
slumber
have
an
end
marcus

griefs

thy
silver
hair

gnawing
with
thy
teeth

be
this
dismal

cheer
thy

will
enchant
the

with
words
more
sweet

rotted
with

with
twenty
popish

his
bauble
for
a
god
and
keeps
the
oath
which
by
that
god
he
swears

what

begot
him
on
the
empress
lucius
o
most
insatiate
and
luxurious
woman
aaron
tut
lucius
this
was
but
a
deed
of
charity
to
that
which
thou
shalt
hear
of
me
anon
was
her
two
sons
that
murdered
bassianus
they
cut
thy
sister
tongue
and
ravish
her
and
cut
her
hands
and
trimm
her
as
thou
sawest
lucius
o
detestable
villain
thou
that
trimming
aaron
why
she
was
wash
and
cut
and
trimm
and
was
trim
sport
for
them
which
had
the
doing
of
it
lucius
o
barbarous
beastly
villains
like
thyself
aaron
indeed
i
was
their
tutor
to
instruct
them
that
codding
spirit
had
they
from
their
mother
as
sure
a
card
as
ever
won
the
set
that
bloody
mind
i
think
they
learn
of
me
as
true
a
dog
as
ever
fought
at
head
well
let
my
deeds
be
witness
of
my
worth
i
train
thy
brethren
to
that
guileful
hole
where
the
dead
corpse
of
bassianus
lay
i
wrote
the
letter
that
thy
father
found
and
hid
the
gold
within
that
letter
mention
confederate
with
the
queen
and
her
two
sons
and
what
not
done
that
thou
hast
cause
to
rue
wherein
i
had
no
stroke
of
mischief
in
it
i
play
the
cheater
for
thy
father
hand
and
when
i
had
it
drew
myself
apart
and
almost
broke
my
heart
with
extreme
laughter
i
pried
me
through
the
crevice
of
a
wall
when
for
his
hand
he
had
his
two
sons
heads
beheld
his
tears
and
laugh
so
heartily
that
both
mine
eyes
were
rainy
like
to
his
and
when
i
told
the
empress
of
this
sport
she
swooned
almost
at
my
pleasing
tale
and
for
my
tidings
gave
me
twenty
kisses
goth
what
canst
thou
say
all
this
and
never
blush
aaron
ay
like
a
black
dog
as
the
saying
is
lucius
art
thou
not
sorry
for
these
heinous
deeds
aaron
ay
that
i
had
not
done
a
thousand
more
even
now
i
curse
the
and
yet
i
think
few
come
within
the
compass
of
my
wherein
i
did
not
some
notorious
ill
as
kill
a
man
or
else
devise
his
death
ravish
a
maid
or
plot
the
way
to
do

some
innocent
and
forswear

set
deadly
enmity
between
two
friends
make
poor
men
cattle
break
their
necks
set
fire
on
barns
and
in
the
night
and
bid
the
owners
quench
them
with
their
tears
oft
have
i
digg
up
dead
men
from
their
graves
and
set
them
upright
at
their
dear
friends
door
even
when
their
sorrows
almost
was
forgot
and
on
their
skins
as
on
the
bark
of
trees
have
with
my
knife
carved
in
roman
letters
not
your
sorrow
die
though
i
am
dead
tut
i
have
done
a
thousand
dreadful
things
as
willingly
as
one
would
kill
a
fly
and
nothing
grieves
me
heartily
indeed
but
that
i
can
not
do
ten
thousand
more

baleful
burning
night
when
subtle
greeks
surpris

hath
bewitch
our
ears
or
who
hath
brought
the
fatal
engine
in
that
gives
our
troy
our
rome
the
civil
wound
my
heart
is
not
compact
of
flint
nor
steel
nor
can
i
utter
all
our
bitter
grief
but
floods
of
tears
will
drown
my
oratory
and
break
my
even
in
the
time
when
it
should
move
ye
to
attend
me
most
and
force
you
to
commiseration
here

unto
the
grave
lastly
myself
unkindly
banished
the
gates
shut
on
me
and
turn
weeping
out
to
beg
relief
among
rome
enemies
who
drown
their
enmity
in
my

of
