introduction
castle
richmond
was
written
in
long
after
trollope
had
left
ireland
the
characterization
is
weak
and
the
plot
although
the
author
himself
thought
well
of
it
mechanical
the
value
of
the
story
is
rather
documentary
than
literary
it
contains
several
graphic
scenes
descriptive
of
the
great
irish
famine
trollope
observed
carefully
and
on
the
whole
impartially
though
his
powers
of
discrimination
were
not
quite
fine
enough
to
make
him
an
ideal
annalist
still
such
as
they
were
he
has
used
them
here
with
no
inconsiderable
effect
his
desire
to
be
fair
has
led
him
to
lay
stress
in
an
inverse
ratio
to
his
prepossessions
and
his
priest
is
a
better
man
than
his
parson
the
best
indeed
the
only
piece
of
real
characterization
in
the
book
is
the
delineation
of
abe
mollett
this
unscrupulous
blackmailer
is
put
before
us
with
real
art
with
something
of
the
loving
preoccupation
of
the
hunter
for
his
quarry
trollope
loved
a
rogue
and
in
his
long
portrait
gallery
there
are
several
really
charming
ones
he
did
not
indeed
perceive
the
aesthetic
value
of
sin
he
did
not
perceive
the
esthetic
value
of
anything
and
his
analysis
of
human
nature
was
not
profound
enough
to
reach
the
conception
of
sin
crime
being
to
him
the
nadir
of
downward
possibility
but
he
had
a
professional
a
sort
of
half
scotland
yard
half
master
of
hounds
interest
in
a
criminal
see
he
would
muse
how
cunningly
the
creature
works
now
back
to
his
earth
anon
stealing
an
unsuspected
run
across
country
the
clever
rascal
and
his
ethical
disapproval
ever
as
usual
with
english
critics
of
life
in
the
foreground
clearly
enhanced
a
primitive
predatory
instinct
not
obscurely
akin
a
cynic
might
say
to
those
dark
impulses
he
holds
up
to
our
reprobation
this
in
his
fiction
is
one
of
trollope
principal
charms
never
was
there
a
more
subjective
writer
unlike
flaubert
who
laid
down
the
canon
that
the
author
should
exist
in
his
work
as
god
in
creation
to
be
here
or
there
dimly
divined
but
never
recognized
though
everywhere
latent
trollope
was
never
weary
of
writing
himself
large
in
every
man
woman
or
child
he
described
the
illusion
of
objectivity
which
he
so
successfully
achieves
is
due
to
the
fact
that
his
mind
was
so
perfectly
contented
with
its
hereditary
and
circumstantial
conditions
was
itself
so
perfectly
the
mental
equivalent
of
those
conditions
thus
the
perfection
of
his
egotism
tight
as
a
drum
saved
him
had
it
been
a
little
less
complete
he
would
have
faltered
and
bungled
as
it
was
he
had
the
naive
certainty
of
a
child
to
whose
innocent
apprehension
the
world
and
self
are
one
and
who
therefore
can
not
err

chapter
i
the

of
desmond
i
wonder
whether
the
world
that
part
of
it
at
least
which
may
honour
my
pages
will
be
offended
if
i
lay
the
plot
of
this
story
in
ireland
that
there
is
a
strong
feeling
against
things
irish
it
is
impossible
to
deny
irish
servants
need
not
apply
irish
acquaintances
are
treated
with
limited
confidence
irish
cousins
are
regarded
as
being
decidedly
dangerous
and
irish
stories
are
not
popular
with
the
booksellers
for
myself
i
may
say
that
if
i
ought
to
know
anything
about
any
place
i
ought
to
know
something
about
ireland
and
i
do
strongly
protest
against
the
injustice
of
the
above
conclusions
irish
cousins
i
have
none
irish
acquaintances
i
have
by
dozens
and
irish
friends
also
by
twos
and
threes
whom
i
can
love
and
cherish
almost
as
well
perhaps
as
though
they
had
been
born
in
middlesex
irish
servants
i
have
had
some
in
my
house
for
years
and
never
had
one
that
was
faithless
dishonest
or
intemperate
i
have
travelled
all
over
ireland
closely
as
few
other
men
can
have
done
and
have
never
had
my
portmanteau
robbed
or
my
pocket
picked
at
hotels
i
have
seldom
locked
up
my
belongings
and
my
carelessness
has
never
been
punished
i
doubt
whether
as
much
can
be
said
for
english
inns
irish
novels
were
once
popular
enough
but
there
is
a
fashion
in
novels
as
there
is
in
colours
and
petticoats
and
now
i
fear
they
are
drugs
in
the
market
it
is
hard
to
say
why
a
good
story
should
not
have
a
fair
chance
of
success
whatever
may
be
its
bent
why
it
should
not
be
reckoned
to
be
good
by
its
own
intrinsic
merits
alone
but
such
is
by
no
means
the
case
i
was
waiting
once
when
i
was
young
at
the
work
in
the
back
parlour
of
an
eminent
publisher
hoping
to
see
his
eminence
on
a
small
matter
of
business
touching
a
manuscript
which
i
held
in
my
hand
the
eminent
publisher
having
probably
larger
fish
to
fry
could
not
see
me
but
sent
his
clerk
or
foreman
to
arrange
the
business
a
novel
is
it
sir
said
the
foreman
yes
i
answered
a
novel
it
depends
very
much
on
the
subject
said
the
foreman
with
a
thoughtful
and
judicious
frown
upon
the
name
sir
and
the
subject
daily
life
sir
that
what
suits
us
daily
english
life
now
your
historical
novel
sir
is
not
worth
the
paper
it
written
on
i
fear
that
irish
character
is
in
these
days
considered
almost
as
unattractive
as
historical
incident
but
nevertheless
i
will
make
the
attempt
i
am
now
leaving
the
green
isle
and
my
old
friends
and
would
fain
say
a
word
of
them
as
i
do
so
if
i
do
not
say
that
word
now
it
will
never
be
said
the
readability
of
a
story
should
depend
one
would
say
on
its
intrinsic
merit
rather
than
on
the
site
of
its
adventures
no
one
will
think
that
hampshire
is
better
for
such
a
purpose
than
cumberland
or
essex
than
leicestershire
what
abstract
objection
can
there
then
be
to
the
county
cork
perhaps
the
most
interesting
and
certainly
the
most
beautiful
part
of
ireland
is
that
which
lies
down
in
the
extreme
with
fingers
stretching
far
out
into
the
atlantic
ocean
this
consists
of
the
counties
cork
and
kerry
or
a
portion
rather
of
those
counties
it
contains
killarney
glengarriffe
bantry
and
inchigeela
and
is
watered
by
the
lee
the
blackwater
and
the
flesk
i
know
not
where
is
to
be
found
a
land
more
rich
in
all
that
constitutes
the
loveliness
of
scenery
within
this
district
but
hardly
within
that
portion
of
it
which
is
most
attractive
to
tourists
is
situated
the
house
and
domain
of
castle
richmond
the
river
blackwater
rises
in
the
county
kerry
and
running
from
west
to
east
through
the
northern
part
of
the
county
cork
enters
the
county
waterford
beyond
fermoy
in
its
course
it
passes
near
the
little
town
of
kanturk
and
through
the
town
of
mallow
castle
richmond
stands
close
upon
its
banks
within
the
barony
of
desmond
and
in
that
kanturk
region
through
which
the
mallow
and
killarney
railway
now
passes
but
which
some
thirteen
years
since
knew
nothing
of
the
navvy
spade
or
even
of
the
engineer
theodolite
castle
richmond
was
at
this
period
the
abode
of
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
who
resided
there
ever
and
always
with
his
wife
lady
fitzgerald
his
two
daughters
mary
and
emmeline
fitzgerald
and
as
often
as
purposes
of
education
and
pleasure
suited
with
his
son
herbert
fitzgerald
neither
sir
thomas
nor
sir
thomas
house
had
about
them
any
of
those
interesting
picturesque
faults
which
are
so
generally
attributed
to
irish
landlords
and
irish
castles
he
was
not
out
of
elbows
nor
was
he
an
absentee
castle
richmond
had
no
appearance
of
having
been
thrown
out
of
its
own
windows
it
was
a
good
substantial
modern
family
residence
built
not
more
than
thirty
years
since
by
the
late
baronet
with
a
lawn
sloping
down
to
the
river
with
kitchen
gardens
and
walls
for
fruit
with
ample
stables
and
a
clock
over
the
entrance
to
the
stable
yard
it
stood
in
a
park
duly
stocked
with
deer
and
with
foxes
also
which
are
agricultural
animals
much
more
valuable
in
an
irish
county
than
deer
so
that
as
regards
its
appearance
castle
richmond
might
have
been
in
hampshire
or
essex
and
as
regards
his
property
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
might
have
been
a
leicestershire
baronet
here
at
castle
richmond
lived
sir
thomas
with
his
wife
and
daughters
and
here
taking
the
period
of
our
story
as
being
exactly
thirteen
years
since
his
son
herbert
was
staying
also
in
those
hard
winter
months
his
oxford
degree
having
been
taken
and
his
english
pursuits
admitting
of
a
temporary
sojourn
in
ireland
but
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
was
not
the
great
man
of
that
part
of
the
country
at
least
not
the
greatest
man
nor
was
lady
fitzgerald
by
any
means
the
greatest
lady
as
this
greatest
lady
and
the
greatest
man
also
will
with
their
belongings
be
among
the
most
prominent
of
our
dramatis
person√¶
it
may
be
well
that
i
should
not
even
say
a
word
of
them
all
the
world
must
have
heard
of
desmond
court
it
is
the
largest
inhabited
residence
known
in
that
part
of
the
world
where
rumours
are
afloat
of
how
it
covers
ten
acres
of
ground
how
in
hewing
the
stones
for
it
a
whole
mountain
was
cut
away
how
it
should
have
cost
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
only
that
the
money
was
never
paid
by
the
rapacious
wicked
bloodthirsty
old
earl
who
caused
it
to
be
erected
and
how
the
cement
was
thickened
with
human
blood
so
goes
rumour
with
the
more
romantic
of
the
celtic
it
is
a
huge
place
huge
ungainly
and
uselessly
extensive
built
at
a
time
when
at
any
rate
in
ireland
men
considered
neither
beauty
aptitude
nor
economy
it
is
three
stories
high
and
stands
round
a
quadrangle
in
which
there
are
two
entrances
opposite
to
each
other
nothing
can
be
well
uglier
than
that
great
paved
court
in
which
there
is
not
a
spot
of
anything
green
except
where
the
damp
has
produced
an
unwholesome
growth
upon
the
stones
nothing
can
well
be
more
desolate
and
on
the
outside
of
the
building
matters
are
not
much
better
there
are
no
gardens
close
up
to
the
house
no
in
the
nooks
and
corners
no
sweet
shrubs
peeping
in
at
the
square
windows
gardens
there
are
but
they
are
away
half
a
mile
off
and
the
great
hall
door
opens
out
upon
a
flat
bleak
park
with
hardly
a
scrap
around
it
which
courtesy
can
call
a
lawn
here
at
this
period
of
ours
lived
clara
countess
of
desmond
widow
of
patrick
once
earl
of
desmond
and
father
of
patrick
now
earl
of
desmond
these
desmonds
had
once
been
mighty
men
in
their
country
ruling
the
people
around
them
as
serfs
and
ruling
them
with
hot
iron
rods
but
those
days
were
now
long
gone
and
tradition
told
little
of
them
that
was
true
how
it
had
truly
fared
either
with
the
earl
or
with
their
serfs
men
did
not
well
know
but
stories
were
ever
being
told
of
walls
built
with
human
blood
and
of
the
devil
bearing
off
upon
his
shoulder
a
certain
earl
who
was
in
any
other
way
quite
unbearable
and
depositing
some
small
unburnt
portion
of
his
remains
fathoms
deep
below
the
soil
in
an
old
near
kanturk
and
there
had
been
a
good
earl
as
is
always
the
case
with
such
families
but
even
his
virtues
according
to
tradition
had
been
of
a
useless
sort
he
had
walked
to
the
shrine
of
finbar
up
in
the
little
island
of
the
gougane
barra
with
unboiled
peas
in
his
shoes
had
forgiven
his
tenants
five
years
rent
all
round
and
never
drank
wine
or
washed
himself
after
the
death
of
his
lady
wife
at
the
present
moment
the
desmonds
were
not
so
potent
either
for
good
or
ill
the
late
earl
had
chosen
to
live
in
london
all
his
life
and
had
sunk
down
to
be
the
toadying
friend
or
perhaps
i
should
more
properly
say
the
bullied
flunky
of
a
sensual
gluttonous
king
late
in
life
when
he
was
broken
in
means
and
character
he
had
married
the
lady
of
his
choice
had
been
chosen
as
an
heiress
but
there
had
been
some
slip
between
that
cup
of
fortune
and
his
lip
and
she
proud
and
beautiful
for
such
she
had
been
had
neither
relieved
nor
softened
the
poverty
of
her
profligate
old
lord
she
was
left
at
his
death
with
two
children
of
whom
the
eldest
lady
clara
desmond
will
be
the
heroine
of
this
story
the
youngest
patrick
now
earl
of
desmond
was
two
years
younger
than
his
sister
and
will
make
our
acquaintance
as
a
lad
fresh
from
eton
in
these
days
money
was
not
plentiful
with
the
desmonds
not
but
that
their
estates
were
as
wide
almost
as
their
renown
and
that
the
desmonds
were
still
great
people
in
the
country
estimation
desmond
court
stood
in
a
bleak
unadorned
region
almost
among
the
mountains
half
way
between
kanturk
and
maccoom
and
the
family
had
some
claim
to
possession
of
the
land
for
miles
around
the
earl
of
the
day
was
still
the
head
landlord
of
a
huge
district
extending
over
the
whole
barony
of
desmond
and
half
the
adjacent
baronies
of
muskerry
and
duhallow
but
the
head
landlord
rent
in
many
cases
hardly
amounted
to
sixpence
an
acre
and
even
those
sixpences
did
not
always
find
their
way
into
the
earl
pocket
when
the
late
earl
had
attained
his
sceptre
he
might
probably
have
been
entitled
to
spend
some
ten
thousand
a
year
but
when
he
died
and
during
the
years
just
previous
to
that
he
had
hardly
been
entitled
to
spend
anything
but
nevertheless
the
desmonds
were
great
people
and
owned
a
great
name
they
had
been
kings
once
over
those
wild
mountains
and
would
be
still
some
said
if
every
one
had
his
own
their
grandeur
was
shown
by
the
prevalence
of
their
name
the
barony
in
which
they
lived
was
the
barony
of
desmond
the
river
which
gave
water
to
their
cattle
was
the
river
desmond
the
wretched
ragged
village
near
their
own
dismantled
gate
was
the
town
of
desmond
the
earl
was
earl
of
desmond
not
earl
desmond
mark
you
and
the
family
name
was
desmond
the
grandfather
of
the
present
earl
who
had
repaired
his
fortune
by
selling
himself
at
the
time
of
the
union
had
been
desmond
desmond
earl
of
desmond
the
late
earl
the
friend
of
the
most
illustrious
person
in
the
kingdom
had
not
been
utterly
able
to
rob
his
heir
of
everything
or
he
would
undoubtedly
have
done
so
at
the
age
of
the
young
earl
would
come
into
possession
of
the
property
damaged
certainly
as
far
as
an
actively
evil
father
could
damage
it
by
long
leases
bad
management
lack
of
outlay
and
but
still
into
the
possession
of
a
considerable
property
in
the
mean
time
it
did
not
fare
very
well
in
a
pecuniary
way
with
clara
the
widowed
countess
or
with
the
lady
clara
her
daughter
the
means
at
the
disposal
were
only
those
which
the
family
trustees
would
allow
her
as
the
earl
mother
on
his
coming
of
age
she
would
have
almost
no
means
of
her
own
and
for
her
daughter
no
provision
whatever
had
been
made
as
this
first
chapter
is
devoted
wholly
to
the
locale
of
my
story
i
will
not
stop
to
say
a
word
as
to
the
persons
or
characters
of
either
of
these
two
ladies
leaving
them
as
i
did
the
castle
richmond
family
to
come
forth
upon
the
canvas
as
opportunity
may
offer
but
there
is
another
homestead
in
this
same
barony
of
desmond
of
which
and
of
its
owner
as
being
its
owner
i
will
say
a
word
hap
house
was
also
the
property
of
a
fitzgerald
it
had
originally
been
built
by
an
old
sir
simon
fitzgerald
for
the
use
and
behoof
of
a
second
son
and
the
present
owner
of
it
was
the
grandson
of
that
man
for
whom
it
had
been
built
and
old
sir
simon
had
given
his
offspring
not
only
a
house
he
had
endowed
the
house
with
a
comfortable
little
slice
of
land
either
cut
from
the
large
patrimonial
loaf
or
else
as
was
more
probable
collected
together
and
separately
baked
for
this
younger
branch
of
the
family
be
that
as
it
may
hap
house
had
of
late
years
been
always
regarded
as
conferring
some
seven
or
eight
hundred
a
year
upon
its
possessor
and
when
young
owen
fitzgerald
succeeded
to
this
property
on
the
death
of
an
uncle
in
the
year
he
was
regarded
as
a
rich
man
to
that
extent
at
that
time
he
was
some
years
of
age
and
he
came
down
from
dublin
where
his
friends
had
intended
that
he
should
practise
as
a
barrister
to
set
up
for
himself
as
a
country
gentleman
hap
house
was
distant
from
castle
richmond
about
four
miles
standing
also
on
the
river
blackwater
but
nearer
to
mallow
it
was
a
pleasant
comfortable
residence
too
large
no
doubt
for
such
a
property
as
is
so
often
the
case
in
ireland
surrounded
by
pleasant
grounds
and
pleasant
gardens
with
a
gorse
fox
covert
belonging
to
the
place
within
a
mile
of
it
with
a
slated
lodge
and
a
pretty
drive
along
the
river
at
the
age
of
owen
fitzgerald
came
into
all
this
and
as
he
at
once
resided
upon
the
place
he
came
in
also
for
the
good
graces
of
all
the
mothers
with
unmarried
daughters
in
the
county
and
for
the
smiles
also
of
many
of
the
daughters
themselves
sir
thomas
and
lady
fitzgerald
were
not
his
uncle
and
aunt
but
nevertheless
they
took
kindly
to
him
very
kindly
at
first
though
that
kindness
after
a
while
became
less
warm
he
was
the
nearest
relation
of
the
name
and
should
anything
happen
as
the
fatal
phrase
goes
to
young
herbert
fitzgerald
he
would
become
the
heir
of
the
family
title
and
of
the
family
place
when
i
hear
of
a
young
man
sitting
down
by
himself
as
the
master
of
a
household
without
a
wife
or
even
without
a
mother
or
sister
to
guide
him
i
always
anticipate
danger
if
he
does
not
go
astray
in
any
other
way
he
will
probably
mismanage
his
money
matters
and
then
there
are
so
many
other
ways
a
house
if
it
be
not
made
pleasant
by
domestic
pleasant
things
must
be
made
pleasant
by
pleasure
and
a
bachelor
pleasures
in
his
own
house
are
always
dangerous
there
is
too
much
wine
drunk
at
his
dinner
parties
his
guests
sit
too
long
over
their
cards
the
servants
know
that
they
want
a
mistress
and
in
the
absence
of
that
mistress
the
language
of
the
household
becomes
loud
and
harsh
and
sometimes
improper
young
men
among
us
seldom
go
quite
straight
in
their
course
unless
they
are
at
any
rate
occasionally
brought
under
the
influence
of
tea
and
small
talk
there
was
no
tea
and
small
talk
at
hap
house
but
there
were
owen
fitzgerald
was
soon
known
for
his
horses
and
his
riding
he
lived
in
the
very
centre
of
the
duhallow
hunt
and
before
he
had
been
six
months
owner
of
his
property
had
built
additional
stables
with
half
a
dozen
loose
boxes
for
his
nags
he
had
an
eye
too
for
a
pretty
girl
not
always
in
the
way
that
is
approved
of
by
mothers
with
marriageable
daughters
but
in
the
way
of
which
they
so
decidedly
disapprove
and
thus
old
ladies
began
to
say
bad
things
those
pleasant
were
spoken
of
as
the
hap
house
orgies
it
was
declared
that
men
slept
there
half
the
day
having
played
cards
all
the
night
and
dreadful
tales
were
told
of
these
tales
was
doubtless
false
but
alas
alas
what
if
were
also
true
it
is
undoubtedly
a
very
dangerous
thing
for
a
young
man
of
to
keep
house
by
himself
either
in
town
or
country
chapter
ii
owen
fitzgerald
i
have
tied
myself
down
to
thirteen
years
ago
as
the
time
of
my
story
but
i
must
go
back
a
little
beyond
this
for
its
first
scenes
and
work
my
way
up
as
quickly
as
may
be
to
the
period
indicated
i
have
spoken
of
a
winter
in
which
herbert
fitzgerald
was
at
home
at
castle
richmond
having
then
completed
his
oxford
doings
but
i
must
say
something
of
two
years
previous
to
that
of
a
time
when
herbert
was
not
so
well
known
in
the
county
as
was
his
cousin
of
hap
house
it
was
a
thousand
pities
that
a
bad
word
should
ever
have
been
spoken
of
owen
fitzgerald
ten
thousand
pities
that
he
should
ever
have
given
occasion
for
such
bad
word
he
was
a
fine
handsome
fellow
with
a
loving
heart
within
his
breast
and
bright
thoughts
within
his
brain
it
was
utterly
wrong
that
a
man
constituted
as
he
was
should
commence
life
by
living
alone
in
a
large
but
those
who
spoke
ill
of
him
should
have
remembered
that
this
was
his
misfortune
rather
than
his
fault
some
greater
endeavour
might
perhaps
have
been
made
to
rescue
him
from
evil
ways
very
little
such
endeavour
was
made
at
all
sir
thomas
once
or
twice
spoke
to
him
but
sir
thomas
was
not
an
energetic
man
and
as
for
lady
fitzgerald
though
she
was
in
many
things
all
that
was
excellent
she
was
far
too
diffident
to
attempt
the
reformation
of
a
headstrong
young
man
who
after
all
was
only
distantly
connected
with
her
and
thus
there
was
no
such
attempt
and
poor
owen
became
the
subject
of
ill
report
without
any
substantial
effort
having
been
made
to
save
him
he
was
a
very
handsome
man
tall
being
somewhat
over
six
feet
in
height
athletic
almost
more
than
in
proportion
with
short
light
hair
blue
eyes
and
a
mouth
perfect
as
that
of
phoebus
he
was
clever
too
though
perhaps
not
educated
as
carefully
as
might
have
been
his
speech
was
usually
rapid
hearty
and
short
and
not
seldom
caustic
and
pointed
had
he
fallen
among
good
hands
he
might
have
done
very
well
in
the
world
fight
but
with
such
a
character
and
lacking
such
advantages
it
was
quite
as
open
to
him
to
do
alas
the
latter
chance
seemed
to
have
fallen
to
him
for
the
first
year
of
his
residence
at
hap
house
he
was
popular
enough
among
his
neighbours
the
hap
house
orgies
were
not
commenced
at
once
nor
when
commenced
did
they
immediately
become
a
subject
of
scandal
and
even
during
the
second
year
he
was
tolerated
tolerated
by
all
and
still
flattered
by
some
among
the
different
houses
in
the
country
at
which
he
had
become
intimate
was
that
of
the
countess
of
desmond
the
countess
of
desmond
did
not
receive
much
company
at
desmond
court
she
had
not
the
means
nor
perhaps
the
will
to
fill
the
huge
old
house
with
parties
of
her
irish
neighbours
for
she
herself
was
english
to
the
backbone
ladies
of
course
made
morning
calls
and
gentlemen
too
occasionally
but
society
at
desmond
court
was
for
some
years
pretty
much
confined
to
this
cold
formal
mode
of
visiting
owen
fitzgerald
however
did
obtain
admittance
into
the
precincts
of
the
desmond
barracks
he
went
there
first
with
the
young
earl
who
then
quite
a
boy
had
had
an
ugly
tumble
from
his
pony
in
the
the
countess
had
expressed
herself
as
very
grateful
for
young
fitzgerald
care
and
thus
an
intimacy
had
sprung
up
owen
had
gone
there
once
or
twice
to
see
the
lad
and
on
those
occasions
had
dined
there
and
on
one
occasion
at
the
young
earl
urgent
request
had
stayed
and
slept
and
then
the
people
of
muskerry
duhallow
and
desmond
began
of
course
to
say
that
the
widow
was
going
to
marry
the
young
man
and
why
not
she
was
still
a
beautiful
woman
not
yet
forty
by
a
good
deal
said
the
few
who
took
her
part
or
at
any
rate
not
much
over
as
was
admitted
by
the
many
who
condemned
her
we
who
have
been
admitted
to
her
secrets
know
that
she
was
then
in
truth
only
she
was
beautiful
proud
and
clever
and
if
it
would
suit
her
to
marry
a
handsome
young
fellow
with
a
good
house
and
an
unembarrassed
income
of
eight
hundred
a
year
why
should
she
not
do
so
as
for
him
would
it
not
be
a
great
thing
for
him
to
have
a
countess
for
his
wife
and
an
earl
for
his
stepson
what
ideas
the
countess
had
on
this
subject
we
will
not
just
now
trouble
ourselves
to
inquire
but
as
to
young
owen
fitzgerald
we
may
declare
at
once
that
no
thought
of
such
a
wretched
alliance
ever
entered
his
head
he
was
sinful
in
many
things
and
foolish
in
many
things
but
he
had
not
that
vile
sin
that
unmanly
folly
which
would
have
made
a
marriage
with
a
widowed
countess
eligible
in
his
eyes
merely
because
she
was
a
countess
and
not
more
than
fifteen
years
his
senior
in
a
matter
of
love
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
paying
his
devotions
to
his
cousin
old
miss
barbara
beamish
of
ballyclahassan
of
whom
it
was
said
that
she
had
set
her
cap
at
every
unmarried
man
that
had
come
into
the
west
riding
of
the
county
for
the
last
forty
years
no
it
may
at
any
rate
be
said
of
owen
fitzgerald
that
he
was
not
the
man
to
make
up
to
a
widowed
countess
for
the
sake
of
the
reflected
glitter
which
might
fall
on
him
from
her
coronet
but
the
countess
of
desmond
was
not
the
only
lady
at
desmond
court
i
have
before
said
that
she
had
a
daughter
the
lady
clara
the
heroine
of
this
coming
story
and
it
may
be
now
right
that
i
should
attempt
some
short
description
of
her
her
virtues
and
faults
her
merits
and
defects
it
shall
be
very
short
for
let
an
author
describe
as
he
will
he
can
not
by
such
course
paint
the
characters
of
his
personages
on
the
minds
of
his
readers
it
is
by
gradual
earnest
efforts
that
this
must
be
done
if
it
be
done
ten
nay
twenty
pages
of
the
finest
descriptive
writing
that
ever
fell
from
the
pen
of
a
novelist
will
not
do
it
clara
desmond
when
young
fitzgerald
first
saw
her
had
hardly
attained
that
incipient
stage
of
womanhood
which
justifies
a
mother
in
taking
her
out
into
the
gaieties
of
the
world
she
was
then
only
sixteen
and
had
not
in
her
manner
and
appearance
so
much
of
the
woman
as
is
the
case
with
many
girls
of
that
age
she
was
shy
and
diffident
in
manner
thin
and
tall
in
person
if
i
were
to
say
that
she
was
angular
and
bony
i
should
disgust
my
readers
who
disliking
the
term
would
not
stop
to
consider
how
many
sweetest
girls
are
at
that
age
truly
subject
to
those
epithets
their
undeveloped
but
active
limbs
are
long
and
fleshless
the
contour
of
their
face
is
the
same
their
elbows
and
shoulders
are
pointed
their
feet
and
hands
seem
to
possess
length
without
breadth
birth
and
breeding
have
given
them
the
frame
of
beauty
to
which
coming
years
will
add
the
soft
roundness
of
form
and
the
rich
glory
of
colour
the
plump
rosy
girl
of
fourteen
though
she
also
is
very
sweet
never
rises
to
such
celestial
power
of
feminine
grace
as
she
who
is
angular
and
bony
whose
limbs
are
long
and
whose
joints
are
sharp
such
was
clara
desmond
at
sixteen
but
still
even
then
to
those
who
were
gifted
with
the
power
of
seeing
she
gave
promise
of
great
loveliness
her
eyes
were
long
and
large
and
wonderfully
clear
there
was
a
liquid
depth
in
them
which
enabled
the
gazer
to
look
down
into
them
as
he
would
into
the
green
pellucid
transparency
of
still
ocean
water
and
then
they
said
so
much
those
young
eyes
of
hers
from
her
mouth
in
those
early
years
words
came
but
scantily
but
from
her
eyes
questions
rained
quicker
than
any
other
eyes
could
answer
them
questions
of
wonder
at
what
the
world
contained
of
wonder
as
to
what
men
thought
and
did
questions
as
to
the
inmost
heart
and
truth
and
purpose
of
the
person
questioned
and
all
this
was
asked
by
a
glance
now
and
again
by
a
glance
of
those
long
shy
liquid
eyes
which
were
ever
falling
on
the
face
of
him
she
questioned
and
then
ever
as
quickly
falling
from
it
her
face
as
i
have
said
was
long
and
thin
but
it
was
the
longness
and
thinness
of
growing
youth
the
natural
lines
of
it
were
full
of
beauty
of
pale
silent
beauty
too
proud
in
itself
to
boast
itself
much
before
the
world
to
make
itself
common
among
many
her
hair
was
already
long
and
rich
but
was
light
in
colour
much
lighter
than
it
grew
to
be
when
some
four
or
five
more
years
had
passed
over
her
head
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
she
wore
it
in
simple
braids
brushed
back
from
her
forehead
not
having
as
yet
learned
that
majestic
mode
of
sweeping
it
from
her
face
which
has
in
subsequent
years
so
generally
prevailed
and
what
then
of
her
virtues
and
her
faults
of
her
merits
and
defects
will
it
not
be
better
to
leave
them
all
to
time
and
the
coming
pages
that
she
was
proud
of
her
birth
proud
of
being
an
irish
desmond
proud
even
of
her
poverty
so
much
i
may
say
of
her
even
at
that
early
age
in
that
she
was
careless
of
the
esteem
fond
to
a
fault
of
romance
poetic
in
her
temperament
and
tender
in
her
heart
she
shared
the
ordinary
shall
i
say
foibles
or
virtues
of
so
many
of
her
sex
she
was
passionately
fond
of
her
brother
but
not
nearly
equally
so
of
her
mother
of
whom
the
brother
was
too
evidently
the
favoured
child
she
had
lived
much
alone
alone
that
is
with
her
governess
and
with
servants
at
desmond
court
not
that
she
had
been
neglected
by
her
mother
but
she
had
hardly
found
herself
to
be
her
companion
and
other
companions
there
she
had
had
none
when
she
was
sixteen
her
governess
was
still
with
her
but
a
year
later
than
that
she
was
left
quite
alone
except
inasmuch
as
she
was
with
her
mother
she
was
sixteen
when
she
first
began
to
ask
questions
of
owen
fitzgerald
face
with
those
large
eyes
of
hers
and
she
saw
much
of
him
and
he
of
her
for
the
twelve
months
immediately
after
that
much
of
him
that
is
as
much
goes
in
this
country
of
ours
where
four
or
five
interviews
in
as
many
months
between
friends
is
supposed
to
signify
that
they
are
often
together
but
this
occurred
chiefly
during
the
young
earl
holidays
now
and
again
he
did
ride
over
in
the
long
intervals
and
when
he
did
do
so
was
not
frowned
upon
by
the
countess
and
so
at
the
end
of
the
winter
holidays
subsequent
to
that
former
winter
in
which
the
earl
had
had
his
tumble
people
through
the
county
began
to
say
that
he
and
the
countess
were
about
to
become
man
and
wife
it
was
just
then
that
people
in
the
county
were
also
beginning
to
talk
of
the
hap
house
orgies
and
the
double
scandal
reached
ears
one
shortly
after
the
other
that
orgies
scandal
did
not
hurt
him
much
it
is
alas
too
true
that
consciousness
of
such
a
reputation
does
not
often
hurt
a
young
man
feelings
but
the
other
rumour
did
wound
him
what
he
sell
himself
to
a
widowed
countess
almost
old
enough
to
be
his
mother
or
bestow
himself
rather
for
what
was
there
in
return
that
could
be
reckoned
as
a
price
at
any
rate
he
had
given
no
one
cause
to
utter
such
falsehood
such
calumny
as
that
no
it
certainly
was
not
probable
that
he
should
marry
the
countess
but
this
set
him
to
ask
himself
whether
it
might
or
might
not
be
possible
that
he
should
marry
some
one
else
might
it
not
be
well
for
him
if
he
could
find
a
younger
bride
at
desmond
court
not
for
nothing
had
he
ridden
over
there
through
those
bleak
mountains
not
for
nothing
nor
yet
solely
with
the
view
of
tying
flies
for
the
young
earl
summer
fishing
or
preparing
the
new
nag
for
his
winter
hunting
those
large
bright
eyes
had
asked
him
many
questions
would
it
not
be
well
that
he
should
answer
them
for
many
months
of
that
year
clara
desmond
had
hardly
spoken
to
him
then
in
the
summer
evening
as
he
and
her
brother
would
lie
sprawling
together
on
the
banks
of
the
little
desmond
river
while
the
lad
was
talking
of
his
fish
and
his
school
and
his
cricket
club
she
would
stand
by
and
listen
and
so
gradually
she
learned
to
speak
and
the
mother
also
would
sometimes
be
there
or
else
she
would
welcome
fitzgerald
in
to
tea
and
let
him
stay
there
talking
as
though
they
were
all
at
home
till
he
would
have
to
make
a
midnight
ride
of
it
before
he
reached
hap
house
it
seemed
that
no
fear
as
to
her
daughter
had
ever
crossed
the
mother
mind
that
no
idea
had
ever
come
upon
her
that
her
favoured
visitor
might
learn
to
love
the
young
girl
with
whom
he
was
allowed
to
associate
on
so
intimate
a
footing
once
or
twice
he
had
caught
himself
calling
her
clara
and
had
done
so
even
before
her
mother
but
no
notice
had
been
taken
of
it
in
truth
lady
desmond
did
not
know
her
daughter
for
the
mother
took
her
absolutely
to
be
a
child
when
in
fact
she
was
a
child
no
longer
you
take
clara
round
by
the
bridge
said
the
earl
to
his
friend
one
august
evening
as
they
were
standing
together
on
the
banks
of
the
river
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
the
sombre
old
pile
in
which
the
family
lived
you
take
clara
round
by
the
bridge
and
i
will
get
over
the
and
so
the
lad
with
his
rod
in
his
hand
began
to
descend
the
steep
bank
i
can
get
over
the
too
patrick
said
she
can
you
though
my
gay
young
woman
you
be
over
your
ankles
if
you
do
that
rain
did
come
down
yesterday
for
nothing
clara
as
she
spoke
had
come
up
to
the
bank
and
now
looked
wistfully
down
at
the
she
had
crossed
them
scores
of
times
sometimes
with
her
brother
and
often
by
herself
why
was
it
that
she
was
so
anxious
to
cross
them
now
it
no
use
your
trying
said
her
brother
who
was
now
half
across
and
who
spoke
from
the
middle
of
the
river
do
you
let
her
owen
she
slip
in
and
then
there
will
be
no
end
of
a
row
up
at
the
house
you
had
better
come
round
by
the
bridge
said
fitzgerald
it
is
not
only
that
the
stones
are
nearly
under
water
but
they
are
wet
and
you
would
slip
so
cautioned
lady
clara
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
and
turned
upwards
along
the
river
by
a
little
path
that
led
to
a
foot
bridge
it
was
some
quarter
of
a
mile
thither
and
it
would
be
the
same
distance
down
the
river
again
before
she
regained
her
brother
i
need
bring
you
with
me
you
know
she
said
to
fitzgerald
you
can
get
over
the
stones
easily
and
i
can
go
very
well
by
myself
but
it
was
not
probable
that
he
would
let
her
do
so
why
should
i
not
go
with
you
he
said
when
i
get
there
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
see
him
fish
only
if
we
were
to
leave
him
by
himself
he
would
not
be
happy
oh
fitzgerald
how
very
kind
you
are
to
him
i
do
so
often
think
of
it
how
dull
his
holidays
would
be
in
this
place
if
it
were
not
for
you
and
what
a
godsend
his
holidays
are
to
me
said
owen
when
they
come
round
i
can
ride
over
here
and
see
him
and
you
and
your
mother
do
you
think
that
i
am
not
dull
also
living
alone
at
hap
house
and
that
this
is
not
an
infinite
blessing
to
me
he
had
named
them
all
son
daughter
and
mother
but
there
had
been
a
something
in
his
voice
an
almost
inappreciable
something
in
his
tone
which
had
seemed
to
mark
to
clara
hearing
that
she
herself
was
not
the
least
prized
of
the
three
attractions
she
had
felt
this
rather
than
realized
it
and
the
feeling
was
not
unpleasant
i
only
know
that
you
are
very
goodnatured
she
continued
and
that
patrick
is
very
fond
of
you
sometimes
i
think
he
almost
takes
you
for
a
brother
and
then
a
sudden
thought
flashed
across
her
mind
and
she
said
hardly
a
word
more
to
him
that
evening
this
had
been
at
the
close
of
the
summer
holidays
after
that
he
had
been
once
or
twice
at
desmond
court
before
the
return
of
the
boy
from
eton
but
on
these
occasions
he
had
been
more
with
the
countess
than
with
her
daughter
on
the
last
of
these
visits
just
before
the
holidays
commenced
he
had
gone
over
respecting
a
hunter
he
had
bought
for
lord
desmond
and
on
this
occasion
he
did
not
even
see
clara
the
countess
when
she
had
thanked
him
for
his
trouble
in
the
matter
of
the
purchase
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
went
on
to
speak
of
other
matters
i
understand
fitzgerald
said
she
that
you
have
been
very
gay
at
hap
house
since
the
hunting
commenced
oh
i
do
know
said
owen
half
laughing
and
half
blushing
a
convenient
place
for
some
of
the
men
and
one
must
be
sociable
sociable
yes
one
ought
to
be
sociable
certainly
but
i
am
always
afraid
of
the
sociability
of
young
men
without
ladies
do
not
be
angry
with
me
if
i
venture
as
a
friend
to
ask
you
not
to
be
too
sociable
i
know
what
you
mean
lady
desmond
people
have
been
accusing
us
of
of
being
rakes
is
that
it
yes
fitzgerald
that
is
it
but
then
i
know
that
i
have
no
right
to
speak
to
you
on
such
a
such
a
subject
yes
yes
you
have
every
right
said
he
warmly
more
right
than
any
one
else
oh
no
sir
thomas
you
know
well
yes
sir
thomas
sir
thomas
is
very
well
and
so
also
is
lady
fitzgerald
but
i
do
not
feel
the
same
interest
about
them
that
i
do
about
you
and
they
are
such
humdrum
people
as
for
herbert
i
afraid
he
turn
out
a
prig
well
fitzgerald
if
you
give
me
the
right
i
shall
use
it
and
getting
up
from
her
chair
and
coming
to
him
where
he
stood
she
looked
kindly
into
his
face
it
was
a
bonny
handsome
face
for
a
woman
to
gaze
on
and
there
was
much
kindness
in
hers
as
she
smiled
on
him
nay
there
was
almost
more
than
kindness
he
thought
as
he
caught
her
eye
it
was
like
almost
like
the
sweetness
of
motherly
love
and
i
shall
scold
you
she
continued
people
say
that
for
two
or
three
nights
running
men
have
been
playing
cards
at
hap
house
till
morning
yes
i
had
some
men
there
for
a
week
i
could
not
take
their
candles
away
and
put
them
to
bed
could
i
lady
desmond
and
there
were
late
suppers
and
drinking
of
toasts
and
headaches
in
the
morning
and
breakfast
at
three
and
gentlemen
with
very
pale
faces
when
they
appeared
rather
late
at
the
meet
eh
mr
fitzgerald
and
she
held
up
one
finger
at
him
as
she
upbraided
him
with
a
smile
the
smile
was
so
sweet
so
unlike
her
usual
look
that
to
tell
the
truth
was
often
too
sad
and
careworn
for
her
age
such
things
do
happen
lady
desmond
ah
yes
they
do
happen
and
with
such
a
one
as
you
heaven
knows
i
do
not
begrudge
the
pleasure
if
it
were
but
now
and
then
once
again
and
then
done
with
but
you
are
too
bright
and
too
good
for
such
things
to
continue
and
she
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
as
a
mother
or
a
mother
dearest
friend
might
have
done
it
would
so
grieve
me
to
think
that
you
should
be
even
in
danger
of
shipwreck
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
for
taking
this
liberty
she
continued
angry
how
could
any
man
be
angry
for
such
kindness
and
you
will
think
of
what
i
say
i
would
not
have
you
unsociable
or
morose
or
inhospitable
but
i
understand
lady
desmond
but
when
young
men
are
together
one
can
not
always
control
them
but
you
will
try
say
that
you
will
try
because
i
have
asked
you
he
promised
that
he
would
and
then
went
his
way
proud
in
his
heart
at
this
solicitude
and
how
could
he
not
be
proud
was
she
not
high
in
rank
proud
in
character
beautiful
withal
and
the
mother
of
clara
desmond
what
sweeter
friend
could
a
man
have
what
counsellor
more
potent
to
avert
those
dangers
which
now
hovered
round
his
head
and
as
he
rode
home
he
was
half
in
love
with
the
countess
where
is
the
young
man
who
has
not
in
his
early
years
been
half
in
love
with
some
woman
older
much
older
than
himself
who
has
half
conquered
his
heart
by
her
solicitude
for
his
welfare
with
some
woman
who
has
whispered
to
him
while
others
were
talking
who
has
told
him
in
such
gentle
loving
tones
of
his
boyish
follies
whose
tenderness
and
experience
together
have
educated
him
and
made
him
manly
young
men
are
so
proud
proud
in
their
inmost
hearts
of
such
tenderness
and
solicitude
as
long
as
it
remains
secret
and
wrapt
as
it
were
in
a
certain
mystery
such
liaisons
have
the
interests
of
intrigue
without
i
was
going
to
say
without
its
dangers
alas
it
may
be
that
it
is
not
always
so
owen
fitzgerald
as
he
rode
home
was
half
in
love
with
the
countess
not
that
his
love
was
of
a
kind
which
made
him
in
any
way
desirous
of
marrying
her
or
of
kneeling
at
her
feet
and
devoting
himself
to
her
for
ever
not
that
it
in
any
way
interfered
with
the
other
love
which
he
was
beginning
to
feel
for
her
daughter
but
he
thought
with
pleasure
of
the
tone
of
her
voice
of
the
pressure
of
her
hand
of
the
tenderness
which
he
had
found
in
her
eye
it
was
after
that
time
as
will
be
understood
that
some
goodnatured
friend
had
told
him
that
he
was
regarded
in
the
county
as
the
future
husband
of
lady
desmond
at
first
he
laughed
at
this
as
being
as
he
himself
said
to
himself
too
good
a
joke
when
the
report
first
reached
him
it
seemed
to
be
a
joke
which
he
could
share
so
pleasantly
with
the
countess
for
men
of
three
and
twenty
though
they
are
so
fond
of
the
society
of
women
older
than
themselves
understand
so
little
the
hearts
and
feelings
of
such
women
in
his
ideas
there
was
an
interval
as
of
another
generation
between
him
and
the
countess
in
her
thoughts
the
interval
was
probably
much
less
striking
but
the
accusation
was
made
to
him
again
and
again
till
it
wounded
him
and
he
gave
up
that
notion
of
a
mutual
joke
with
his
kind
friend
at
desmond
court
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
she
could
ever
think
of
loving
him
as
her
lord
and
master
but
it
was
brought
home
to
him
that
other
people
thought
so
a
year
had
now
passed
by
since
those
winter
holidays
in
which
clara
desmond
had
been
sixteen
and
during
which
she
was
described
by
epithets
which
will
not
i
fear
have
pleased
my
readers
those
epithets
were
now
somewhat
less
deserved
but
still
the
necessity
of
them
had
not
entirely
passed
away
her
limbs
were
still
thin
and
long
and
her
shoulders
pointed
but
the
growth
of
beauty
had
commenced
and
in
owen
eyes
she
was
already
very
lovely
at
during
that
winter
a
ball
was
given
at
castle
richmond
to
celebrate
the
coming
of
age
of
the
young
heir
it
was
not
a
very
gay
affair
for
the
castle
richmond
folk
even
in
those
days
were
not
very
gay
people
sir
thomas
though
only
fifty
was
an
old
man
for
his
age
and
lady
fitzgerald
though
known
intimately
by
the
poor
all
round
her
was
not
known
intimately
by
any
but
the
poor
mary
and
emmeline
fitzgerald
with
whom
we
shall
become
better
acquainted
as
we
advance
in
our
story
were
nice
good
girls
and
handsome
withal
but
they
had
not
that
special
gift
which
enables
some
girls
to
make
a
party
in
their
own
house
bright
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
we
should
have
but
little
to
do
with
this
ball
were
it
not
that
clara
desmond
was
here
first
brought
out
as
the
term
goes
it
was
the
first
large
party
to
which
she
had
been
taken
and
it
was
to
her
a
matter
of
much
wonder
and
inquiry
with
those
wondering
speaking
eyes
and
owen
fitzgerald
was
there
as
a
matter
of
course
the
reader
will
say
by
no
means
so
previous
to
that
ball
owen
sins
had
been
commented
upon
at
castle
richmond
and
sir
thomas
had
expostulated
with
him
these
expostulations
had
not
been
received
quite
so
graciously
as
those
of
the
handsome
countess
and
there
had
been
anger
at
castle
richmond
now
there
was
living
in
the
house
of
castle
richmond
one
miss
letty
fitzgerald
a
maiden
sister
of
the
baronet
older
than
her
brother
by
full
ten
years
in
her
character
there
was
more
of
energy
and
also
much
more
of
harsh
judgment
and
of
consequent
than
in
that
of
her
brother
when
the
letters
of
invitation
were
being
sent
out
by
the
two
girls
she
had
given
a
decided
opinion
that
the
reprobate
should
not
be
asked
but
the
reprobate
cousins
with
that
partiality
for
a
rake
which
is
so
common
to
young
ladies
would
not
abide
by
their
aunt
command
and
referred
the
matter
both
to
mamma
and
papa
mamma
thought
it
very
hard
that
their
own
cousin
should
be
refused
admittance
to
their
house
and
very
dreadful
that
his
sins
should
be
considered
to
be
of
so
deep
a
dye
as
to
require
so
severe
a
sentence
and
then
papa
much
balancing
the
matter
gave
final
orders
that
the
prodigal
cousin
should
be
admitted
he
was
admitted
and
dangerously
he
used
the
privilege
the
countess
who
was
there
stood
up
to
dance
twice
and
twice
only
she
opened
the
ball
with
young
herbert
fitzgerald
the
heir
and
in
about
an
hour
afterwards
she
danced
again
with
owen
he
did
not
ask
her
twice
but
he
asked
her
daughter
three
or
four
times
and
three
or
four
times
he
asked
her
successfully
clara
whispered
the
mother
to
her
child
after
the
last
of
these
occasions
giving
some
little
pull
or
twist
to
her
girl
frock
as
she
did
so
you
had
better
not
dance
with
owen
fitzgerald
again
people
will
remark
about
it
will
they
said
clara
and
immediately
sat
down
checked
in
her
young
happiness
not
many
minutes
afterwards
owen
came
up
to
her
again
may
we
have
another
waltz
together
i
wonder
he
said
not
i
think
i
am
rather
tired
already
and
so
she
did
not
waltz
again
all
the
evening
for
fear
she
should
offend
him
but
the
countess
though
she
had
thus
interdicted
her
dancing
with
the
master
of
hap
house
had
not
done
so
through
any
absolute
fear
to
her
her
girl
was
still
a
child
a
child
without
a
woman
thoughts
or
any
of
a
woman
charms
and
then
it
was
so
natural
that
clara
should
like
to
dance
with
almost
the
only
gentleman
who
was
not
absolutely
a
stranger
to
her
lady
desmond
had
been
actuated
rather
by
a
feeling
that
it
would
be
well
that
clara
should
begin
to
know
other
persons
by
that
feeling
and
perhaps
unconsciously
by
another
that
it
would
be
well
that
owen
fitzgerald
should
be
relieved
from
his
attendance
on
the
child
and
enabled
to
give
it
to
the
mother
whether
lady
desmond
had
at
that
time
realized
any
ideas
as
to
her
own
interest
in
this
young
man
it
was
at
any
rate
true
that
she
loved
to
have
him
near
her
she
had
refused
to
dance
a
second
time
with
herbert
fitzgerald
she
had
refused
to
stand
up
with
any
other
person
who
had
asked
her
but
with
owen
she
would
either
have
danced
again
or
have
kept
him
by
her
side
while
she
explained
to
him
with
flattering
frankness
that
she
could
not
do
so
lest
others
should
be
offended
and
owen
was
with
her
frequently
through
the
evening
she
was
taken
to
and
from
supper
by
sir
thomas
but
any
other
takings
that
were
incurred
were
done
by
him
he
led
her
from
one
to
another
he
took
her
empty
he
stood
behind
her
chair
and
talked
to
her
and
he
brought
her
the
scarf
which
she
had
left
elsewhere
and
finally
he
put
a
shawl
round
her
neck
while
old
sir
thomas
was
waiting
to
hand
her
to
her
carriage
reader
reader
remember
that
she
was
only
and
that
hitherto
she
had
known
nothing
of
the
delights
of
love
by
the
young
any
such
hallucination
on
her
part
at
her
years
will
be
regarded
as
lunacy
or
at
least
frenzy
owen
fitzgerald
drove
home
from
that
ball
in
a
state
of
mind
that
was
hardly
satisfactory
in
the
first
place
miss
letty
had
made
a
direct
attack
upon
his
morals
which
he
had
not
answered
in
the
most
courteous
manner
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
your
doings
master
owen
she
said
to
him
a
fine
house
you
keeping
why
do
you
come
and
join
us
aunt
letty
he
replied
it
would
be
just
the
thing
for
you
god
forbid
said
the
old
maid
turning
up
her
eyes
to
heaven
oh
you
might
do
worse
you
know
with
us
you
only
drink
and
play
cards
and
perhaps
hear
a
little
strong
language
now
and
again
but
what
that
to
slander
and
calumny
and
bearing
false
witness
against
one
neighbour
and
so
saying
he
ended
that
interview
not
in
a
manner
to
ingratiate
himself
with
his
relative
miss
letty
fitzgerald
after
that
in
the
more
than
one
wag
of
a
fellow
had
congratulated
him
on
his
success
with
the
widow
she
got
some
sort
of
a
jointure
i
suppose
said
one
she
very
certainly
to
be
the
mother
of
that
girl
declared
another
upon
my
word
she
a
handsome
woman
still
said
a
third
and
what
title
will
you
get
when
you
marry
her
fitz
asked
a
fourth
who
was
rather
ignorant
as
to
the
phases
under
which
the
british
peerage
develops
itself
fitzgerald
pshawed
and
pished
and
poohed
and
then
breaking
away
from
them
rode
home
he
felt
that
he
must
at
any
rate
put
an
end
to
this
annoyance
about
the
countess
and
that
he
must
put
an
end
also
to
his
state
of
doubt
about
the
countess
daughter
clara
had
been
kind
and
gracious
to
him
in
the
first
part
of
the
evening
nay
almost
more
than
gracious
why
had
she
been
so
cold
when
he
went
up
to
her
on
that
last
occasion
why
had
she
gathered
herself
like
a
snail
into
its
shell
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
the
young
earl
had
also
been
at
the
party
and
had
exacted
a
promise
from
owen
that
he
would
be
over
at
desmond
court
on
the
next
day
it
had
almost
been
on
owen
lips
to
tell
his
friend
not
only
that
he
would
be
there
but
what
would
be
his
intention
when
he
got
there
he
knew
that
the
lad
loved
him
well
and
almost
fancied
that
earl
as
he
was
he
would
favour
his
friend
suit
but
a
feeling
that
lord
desmond
was
only
a
boy
restrained
him
it
would
not
be
well
to
induce
one
so
young
to
agree
to
an
arrangement
of
which
in
after
and
more
mature
years
he
would
so
probably
disapprove
but
not
the
less
did
fitzgerald
as
he
drove
home
determine
that
on
the
next
day
he
would
know
something
of
his
fate
and
with
this
resolve
he
endeavoured
to
comfort
himself
as
he
drove
up
into
his
own
avenue
and
betook
himself
to
his
own
solitary
home
chapter
iii
clara
desmond
it
had
been
clara
desmond
first
ball
and
on
the
following
morning
she
had
much
to
occupy
her
thoughts
in
the
first
place
had
she
been
pleased
or
had
she
not
had
she
been
most
gratified
or
most
pained
girls
when
they
ask
themselves
such
questions
seldom
give
themselves
fair
answers
she
had
liked
dancing
with
owen
fitzgerald
oh
so
much
she
had
liked
dancing
with
others
too
though
she
had
not
known
them
and
had
hardly
spoken
to
them
the
mere
act
of
dancing
with
the
loud
music
in
the
room
and
the
gay
dresses
and
bright
lights
around
her
had
been
delightful
but
then
it
had
pained
her
she
knew
not
why
but
it
had
pained
her
when
her
mother
told
her
that
people
would
make
remarks
about
her
had
she
done
anything
improper
on
this
her
first
entry
into
the
world
was
her
conduct
to
be
scanned
and
judged
and
condemned
while
she
was
flattering
herself
that
no
one
had
noticed
her
but
him
who
was
speaking
to
her
their
breakfast
was
late
and
the
countess
sat
as
was
her
wont
with
her
book
beside
her
speaking
a
word
every
now
and
again
to
her
son
owen
will
be
over
here
said
he
we
are
going
to
have
a
schooling
match
down
on
the
callows
now
in
ireland
a
schooling
match
means
the
amusement
of
teaching
your
horses
to
jump
will
he
said
lady
desmond
looking
up
from
her
book
for
a
moment
mind
you
bring
him
in
to
lunch
i
want
to
speak
to
him
he
does
care
much
about
lunch
i
fancy
said
he
and
maybe
we
shall
be
half
way
to
millstreet
by
that
time
never
mind
but
do
as
i
tell
you
you
expect
everybody
to
be
as
wild
and
wayward
as
yourself
and
the
countess
smiled
on
her
son
in
a
manner
which
showed
that
she
was
proud
even
of
his
wildness
and
his
waywardness
clara
had
felt
that
she
blushed
when
she
heard
that
fitzgerald
was
to
be
there
that
morning
she
felt
that
her
own
manner
became
constrained
and
was
afraid
that
her
mother
should
look
at
her
owen
had
said
nothing
to
her
about
love
and
she
child
as
she
was
had
thought
nothing
about
love
but
she
was
conscious
of
something
she
knew
not
what
he
had
touched
her
hand
during
those
dances
as
it
had
never
been
touched
before
he
had
looked
into
her
eyes
and
her
eyes
had
fallen
before
his
glance
he
had
pressed
her
waist
and
she
had
felt
that
there
was
tenderness
in
the
pressure
so
she
blushed
and
almost
trembled
when
she
heard
that
he
was
coming
and
was
glad
in
her
heart
when
she
found
that
there
was
neither
anger
nor
sunshine
in
her
mother
face
not
long
after
breakfast
the
earl
went
out
on
his
horse
and
met
owen
at
some
gate
or
back
entrance
in
his
opinion
the
old
house
was
stupid
and
the
women
in
it
were
stupid
companions
in
the
morning
his
heart
for
the
moment
was
engaged
on
the
thought
of
making
his
animal
take
the
most
impracticable
leaps
which
he
could
find
and
it
did
not
occur
to
him
at
first
to
give
his
mother
message
to
his
companion
as
for
lunch
they
would
get
a
biscuit
and
glass
of
at
wat
of
drumban
and
as
for
his
mother
having
anything
to
say
that
of
course
went
for
nothing
owen
would
have
been
glad
to
have
gone
up
to
the
house
but
in
that
he
was
frustrated
by
the
earl
sharpness
in
catching
him
his
next
hope
was
to
get
through
the
promised
lesson
in
as
quickly
as
possible
so
that
he
might
return
to
desmond
court
and
take
his
chance
of
meeting
clara
but
in
this
he
found
the
earl
very
difficult
to
manage
oh
owen
we
wo
go
there
he
said
when
fitzgerald
proposed
a
canter
through
some
meadows
down
by
the
there
are
only
a
few
gripes
irish
for
small
ditches
and
i
have
ridden
fireball
over
them
a
score
of
times
i
want
you
to
come
away
towards
drumban
drumban
why
drumban
seven
miles
from
here
what
matter
besides
it
not
six
the
way
i
take
you
i
want
to
see
wat
especially
he
has
a
litter
of
puppies
there
out
of
that
black
bitch
of
his
and
i
mean
to
make
him
give
me
one
of
them
but
on
that
morning
owen
fitzgerald
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
taken
so
far
as
drumban
even
on
a
mission
so
important
as
this
the
young
lord
fought
the
matter
stoutly
but
it
ended
by
his
being
forced
to
content
himself
with
picking
out
all
the
most
dangerous
parts
of
the
fences
in
the
river
meadows
why
you
hardly
tried
your
own
mare
at
all
said
the
lad
reproachfully
i
going
to
hunt
her
on
saturday
said
owen
and
she
have
quite
enough
to
do
then
well
you
very
slow
you
done
up
with
the
dancing
i
think
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
now
i
go
home
with
you
i
think
and
pay
my
respects
to
the
countess
i
was
to
bring
you
in
to
lunch
she
said
she
wanted
to
see
you
by
jingo
i
forgot
all
about
it
but
you
all
become
very
stupid
among
you
i
know
that
and
so
they
rode
back
to
desmond
court
entering
the
demesne
by
one
of
the
straight
dull
level
roads
which
led
up
to
the
house
but
it
did
not
suit
the
earl
to
ride
on
the
road
while
the
grass
was
so
near
him
so
they
turned
off
with
a
curve
across
what
was
called
the
park
thus
prolonging
their
return
by
about
double
the
necessary
distance
as
they
were
cantering
on
owen
saw
her
of
whom
he
was
in
quest
walking
in
the
road
which
they
had
left
his
best
chance
of
seeing
her
alone
had
been
that
of
finding
her
outside
the
house
he
knew
that
the
countess
rarely
or
never
walked
with
her
daughter
and
that
as
the
governess
was
gone
clara
was
driven
to
walk
by
herself
desmond
he
said
pulling
up
his
horse
do
you
go
on
and
tell
your
mother
that
i
will
be
with
her
almost
immediately
why
where
are
you
off
to
now
there
is
your
sister
and
i
must
ask
her
how
she
is
after
the
ball
and
so
saying
he
trotted
back
in
the
direction
of
the
road
lady
clara
had
seen
them
and
though
she
had
hardly
turned
her
head
she
had
seen
also
how
suddenly
fitzgerald
had
stopped
his
horse
and
turned
his
course
when
he
perceived
her
at
the
first
moment
she
had
been
almost
angry
with
him
for
riding
away
from
her
and
now
she
felt
almost
angry
with
him
because
he
did
not
do
so
he
slackened
his
pace
as
he
came
near
her
and
approached
her
at
a
walk
there
was
very
little
of
the
faint
heart
about
owen
fitzgerald
at
any
time
or
in
anything
that
he
attempted
he
had
now
made
up
his
mind
fairly
to
tell
clara
desmond
that
he
loved
her
and
to
ask
for
her
love
in
return
he
had
resolved
to
do
so
and
there
was
very
little
doubt
but
that
he
would
carry
out
his
resolution
but
he
had
in
nowise
made
up
his
mind
how
he
should
do
it
or
what
his
words
should
be
and
now
that
he
saw
her
so
near
him
he
wanted
a
moment
to
collect
his
thoughts
he
took
off
his
hat
as
he
rode
up
and
asked
her
whether
she
was
tired
after
the
ball
and
then
dismounting
he
left
his
mare
to
follow
as
she
pleased
oh
fitzgerald
wo
she
run
away
said
clara
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
oh
no
she
has
been
taught
better
than
that
but
you
do
tell
me
how
you
are
i
thought
you
were
tired
last
night
when
i
saw
that
you
had
altogether
given
over
dancing
and
then
he
walked
on
beside
her
and
the
docile
mare
followed
them
like
a
dog
no
i
was
not
tired
at
least
not
exactly
said
clara
blushing
again
and
again
being
conscious
that
she
blushed
but
but
you
know
it
was
the
first
ball
i
was
ever
at
that
is
just
the
reason
why
you
should
have
enjoyed
it
the
more
instead
of
sitting
down
as
you
did
and
being
dull
and
unhappy
for
i
know
you
were
unhappy
i
could
see
it
was
i
said
clara
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
yes
and
i
tell
you
what
i
could
see
more
than
that
it
was
i
that
made
you
unhappy
you
mr
fitzgerald
yes
i
you
will
not
deny
it
because
you
are
so
true
i
asked
you
to
dance
with
me
too
often
and
because
you
refused
me
you
did
not
like
to
dance
with
any
one
else
i
saw
it
all
will
you
deny
that
it
was
so
oh
mr
fitzgerald
poor
girl
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
how
to
shape
her
speech
into
indifference
how
to
assure
him
that
he
made
himself
out
to
be
of
too
much
consequence
by
far
how
to
make
it
plain
that
she
had
not
danced
because
there
was
no
one
there
worth
dancing
with
had
she
been
out
for
a
year
or
two
instead
of
being
such
a
novice
she
would
have
accomplished
all
this
in
half
a
dozen
words
as
it
was
her
face
confessed
it
all
and
she
was
only
able
to
ejaculate
oh
mr
fitzgerald
when
i
went
there
last
night
he
continued
i
had
only
one
wish
one
hope
that
was
to
see
you
pleased
and
happy
i
knew
it
was
your
first
ball
and
i
did
so
long
to
see
you
enjoy
it
and
so
i
did
till
till
what
will
you
not
let
me
ask
mamma
said
something
to
me
and
that
stopped
me
from
dancing
she
told
you
not
to
dance
with
me
was
that
it
how
was
it
possible
that
she
should
have
had
a
chance
with
him
innocent
young
and
ignorant
as
she
was
she
did
not
tell
him
in
words
that
so
it
had
been
but
she
looked
into
his
face
with
a
glance
of
doubt
and
pain
that
answered
his
question
as
plainly
as
any
words
could
have
done
of
course
she
did
and
it
was
i
that
destroyed
it
all
i
that
should
have
been
satisfied
to
stand
still
and
see
you
happy
how
you
must
have
hated
me
oh
no
indeed
i
did
not
i
was
not
at
all
angry
with
you
indeed
why
should
i
have
been
it
was
so
kind
of
you
wishing
to
dance
with
me
no
it
was
selfish
selfish
in
the
extreme
nothing
but
one
thing
could
excuse
me
and
that
excuse
i
sure
you
do
want
any
excuse
mr
fitzgerald
and
that
excuse
clara
was
this
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
i
had
not
strength
to
see
you
there
and
not
long
to
have
you
near
me
not
begrudge
that
you
should
dance
with
another
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
there
lady
clara
now
you
know
it
all
the
manner
in
which
he
made
his
declaration
to
her
was
almost
fierce
in
its
energy
he
had
stopped
in
the
pathway
and
she
unconscious
of
what
she
was
doing
almost
unconscious
of
what
she
was
hearing
had
stopped
also
the
mare
taking
advantage
of
the
occasion
was
cropping
the
grass
close
to
them
and
so
for
a
few
seconds
they
stood
in
silence
am
i
so
bold
lady
clara
said
he
when
those
few
seconds
had
gone
by
am
i
so
bold
that
i
may
hope
for
no
answer
but
still
she
said
nothing
in
lieu
of
speaking
she
uttered
a
long
sigh
and
then
fitzgerald
could
hear
that
she
was
sobbing
oh
clara
i
love
you
so
fondly
so
dearly
so
truly
said
he
in
an
altered
voice
and
with
sweet
tenderness
i
know
my
own
presumption
in
thus
speaking
i
know
and
feel
bitterly
the
difference
in
our
rank
i
care
nothing
for
rank
said
the
poor
girl
sobbing
through
her
tears
he
was
generous
and
she
at
any
rate
would
not
be
less
so
no
at
that
moment
with
her
scanty
seventeen
years
of
experience
with
her
ignorance
of
all
that
the
world
had
in
it
of
grand
and
great
of
high
and
rich
she
did
care
nothing
for
rank
that
owen
fitzgerald
was
a
gentleman
of
good
lineage
fit
to
mate
with
a
lady
that
she
did
know
for
her
mother
who
was
a
proud
woman
delighted
to
have
him
in
her
presence
beyond
this
she
cared
for
none
of
the
conventionalities
of
life
rank
if
she
waited
for
rank
where
was
she
to
look
for
friends
who
would
love
her
earls
and
countesses
barons
and
their
baronesses
were
scarce
there
where
fate
had
placed
her
under
the
shadow
of
the
bleak
mountains
of
muskerry
her
want
her
undefined
want
was
that
some
one
should
love
her
of
all
men
and
women
whom
she
had
hitherto
known
this
owen
fitzgerald
was
the
brightest
the
kindest
the
gentlest
in
his
manner
the
most
pleasant
to
look
on
and
now
he
was
there
at
her
feet
swearing
that
he
loved
her
and
then
drawing
back
as
it
were
in
dread
of
her
rank
what
did
she
care
for
rank
clara
clara
my
clara
can
you
learn
to
love
me
she
had
made
her
one
little
effort
at
speaking
when
she
attempted
to
repudiate
the
pedestal
on
which
he
affected
to
place
her
but
after
that
she
could
for
a
while
say
no
more
but
she
still
sobbed
and
still
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
clara
say
one
word
to
me
say
that
you
do
not
hate
me
but
just
at
that
moment
she
had
not
one
word
to
say
if
you
will
bid
me
do
so
i
will
leave
this
country
altogether
i
will
go
away
and
i
shall
not
much
care
whither
i
can
only
stay
now
on
condition
of
your
loving
me
i
have
thought
of
this
day
for
the
last
year
past
and
now
it
has
come
every
word
that
he
now
spoke
was
gospel
to
her
is
it
not
always
so
should
it
not
be
so
always
when
love
first
speaks
to
loving
ears
what
he
had
loved
her
for
that
whole
twelvemonth
that
she
had
known
him
loved
her
in
those
days
when
she
had
been
wont
to
look
up
into
his
face
wondering
why
he
was
so
nice
so
much
nicer
than
any
one
else
that
came
near
her
a
year
was
a
great
deal
to
her
and
had
he
loved
her
through
all
those
days
and
after
that
should
she
banish
him
from
her
house
turn
him
away
from
his
home
and
drive
him
forth
unhappy
and
wretched
ah
no
she
could
not
be
so
unkind
to
him
she
could
not
be
so
unkind
to
her
own
heart
but
still
she
sobbed
and
still
she
said
nothing
in
the
mean
time
they
had
turned
and
were
now
walking
back
towards
the
house
the
mare
still
following
at
their
heels
they
were
walking
slowly
very
slowly
back
just
creeping
along
the
path
when
they
saw
lady
desmond
and
her
son
coming
to
meet
them
on
the
road
there
is
your
mother
clara
say
one
word
to
me
before
we
meet
them
oh
fitzgerald
i
am
so
frightened
what
will
mamma
say
say
about
what
as
yet
i
do
not
know
what
she
may
have
to
say
but
before
we
meet
her
may
i
not
hope
to
know
what
her
daughter
will
say
answer
me
this
clara
can
you
will
you
love
me
there
was
still
a
pause
a
moment
pause
and
then
some
sound
did
fall
from
her
lips
but
yet
it
was
so
soft
so
gentle
so
slight
that
it
could
hardly
be
said
to
reach
even
a
lover
ear
fitzgerald
however
made
the
most
of
it
whether
it
were
yes
or
whether
it
were
no
he
took
it
as
being
favourable
and
lady
clara
desmond
gave
him
no
sign
to
show
that
he
was
mistaken
my
own
own
only
loved
one
he
said
embracing
her
as
it
were
with
his
words
since
the
presence
of
her
approaching
mother
forbade
him
even
to
take
her
hand
in
his
i
am
happy
now
whatever
may
occur
whatever
others
may
say
for
i
know
that
you
will
be
true
to
me
and
remember
this
whatever
others
may
say
i
also
will
be
true
to
you
you
will
think
of
that
will
you
not
love
this
time
she
did
answer
him
almost
audibly
yes
she
said
and
then
she
devoted
herself
to
a
vain
endeavour
to
remove
the
traces
of
her
tears
before
her
mother
should
be
close
to
them
fitzgerald
at
once
saw
that
such
endeavour
must
be
vain
at
one
time
he
had
thought
of
turning
away
and
pretending
that
they
had
not
seen
the
countess
but
he
knew
that
clara
would
not
be
able
to
carry
out
any
such
pretence
and
he
reflected
also
that
it
might
be
just
as
well
that
lady
desmond
should
know
the
whole
at
once
that
she
would
know
it
and
know
it
soon
he
was
quite
sure
she
could
learn
it
not
only
from
clara
but
from
himself
he
could
not
now
be
there
at
the
house
without
showing
that
he
both
loved
and
knew
that
he
was
beloved
and
then
why
should
lady
desmond
not
know
it
why
should
he
think
that
she
would
set
herself
against
the
match
he
had
certainly
spoken
to
clara
of
the
difference
in
their
rank
but
after
all
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
an
earl
daughter
to
marry
a
commoner
and
in
this
case
the
earl
daughter
was
portionless
and
the
lover
desired
no
portion
owen
fitzgerald
at
any
rate
might
boast
that
he
was
true
and
generous
in
his
love
so
he
plucked
up
his
courage
and
walked
on
with
a
smiling
face
to
meet
lady
desmond
and
her
son
while
poor
clara
crept
beside
him
with
eyes
downcast
and
in
an
agony
of
terror
lady
desmond
had
not
left
the
house
with
any
apprehension
that
there
was
aught
amiss
her
son
had
told
her
that
owen
had
gone
off
to
do
the
civil
to
clara
and
as
he
did
not
come
to
the
house
within
some
twenty
minutes
after
this
she
had
proposed
that
they
would
go
and
meet
him
did
you
tell
him
that
i
wanted
him
said
the
countess
oh
yes
i
did
and
he
is
coming
only
he
would
go
away
to
clara
then
i
shall
scold
him
for
his
want
of
gallantry
said
lady
desmond
laughing
as
they
walked
out
together
from
beneath
the
huge
portal
but
as
soon
as
she
was
near
enough
to
see
the
manner
of
their
gait
as
they
slowly
came
on
towards
her
her
woman
tact
told
her
that
something
was
wrong
and
whispered
to
her
also
what
might
too
probably
be
the
nature
of
that
something
could
it
be
possible
she
asked
herself
that
such
a
man
as
owen
fitzgerald
should
fall
in
love
with
such
a
girl
as
her
daughter
clara
what
shall
i
say
to
mamma
whispered
clara
to
him
as
they
all
drew
near
together
tell
her
everything
but
patrick
i
will
take
him
off
with
me
if
i
can
and
then
they
were
all
together
standing
in
the
road
i
was
coming
to
obey
your
behests
lady
desmond
said
fitzgerald
trying
to
look
and
speak
as
though
he
were
at
his
ease
coming
rather
tardily
i
think
said
her
ladyship
not
altogether
playfully
i
told
him
you
wanted
him
as
we
were
crossing
to
the
house
said
the
earl
did
i
owen
is
anything
the
matter
with
clara
said
lady
desmond
looking
at
her
daughter
no
mamma
said
clara
and
she
instantly
began
to
sob
and
cry
what
is
it
sir
and
as
she
asked
she
turned
to
fitzgerald
and
her
manner
now
at
least
had
in
it
nothing
playful
lady
clara
is
nervous
and
hysterical
the
excitement
of
the
ball
has
perhaps
been
too
much
for
her
i
think
lady
desmond
if
you
were
to
take
her
in
with
you
it
would
be
well
lady
desmond
looked
up
at
him
and
he
then
saw
for
the
first
time
that
she
could
if
she
pleased
look
very
stern
hitherto
her
face
had
always
worn
smiles
had
at
any
rate
always
been
pleasing
when
he
had
seen
it
he
had
never
been
intimate
with
her
never
intimate
enough
to
care
what
her
face
was
like
till
that
day
when
he
had
carried
her
son
up
from
the
hall
door
to
his
room
then
her
countenance
had
been
all
anxiety
for
her
darling
and
afterwards
it
had
been
all
sweetness
for
her
darling
friend
from
that
day
to
this
present
one
lady
desmond
had
ever
given
him
her
sweetest
smiles
but
fitzgerald
was
not
a
man
to
be
cowed
by
any
woman
looks
he
met
hers
by
a
full
front
face
in
return
he
did
not
allow
his
eye
for
a
moment
to
fall
before
hers
and
yet
he
did
not
look
at
her
haughtily
or
with
defiance
but
with
an
aspect
which
showed
that
he
was
ashamed
of
nothing
that
he
had
done
whether
he
had
done
anything
that
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
or
no
clara
said
the
countess
in
a
voice
which
fell
with
awful
severity
on
the
poor
girl
ears
you
had
better
return
to
the
house
with
me
yes
mamma
and
shall
i
wait
on
you
lady
desmond
said
fitzgerald
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
the
countess
to
be
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
almost
impertinent
the
man
had
certainly
been
misbehaving
himself
and
yet
there
was
not
about
him
the
slightest
symptom
of
shame
yes
no
said
the
countess
that
is
i
will
write
a
note
to
you
if
it
be
necessary
good
morning
lady
desmond
said
owen
and
as
he
took
off
his
hat
with
his
left
hand
he
put
out
his
right
to
shake
hands
with
her
as
was
customary
with
him
lady
desmond
was
at
first
inclined
to
refuse
the
courtesy
but
she
either
thought
better
of
such
intention
or
else
she
had
not
courage
to
maintain
it
for
at
parting
she
did
give
him
her
hand
lady
clara
and
he
also
shook
hands
with
her
and
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
there
was
a
lover
pressure
in
the
grasp
said
clara
through
her
tears
in
the
saddest
soberest
tone
he
was
going
away
happy
light
hearted
with
nothing
to
trouble
him
but
she
had
to
encounter
that
fearful
task
of
telling
her
own
crime
she
had
to
depart
with
her
mother
her
mother
who
though
never
absolutely
unkind
had
so
rarely
been
tender
with
her
and
then
her
brother
desmond
said
fitzgerald
walk
as
far
as
the
lodge
with
me
like
a
good
fellow
i
have
something
that
i
want
to
say
to
you
the
mother
thought
for
a
moment
that
she
would
call
her
son
back
but
then
she
bethought
herself
that
she
also
might
as
well
be
without
him
so
the
young
earl
showing
plainly
by
his
eyes
that
he
knew
that
much
was
the
matter
went
back
with
fitzgerald
towards
the
lodge
what
is
it
you
have
done
now
said
the
earl
the
boy
had
some
sort
of
an
idea
that
the
offence
committed
was
with
reference
to
his
sister
and
his
tone
was
hardly
as
gracious
as
was
usual
with
him
this
want
of
kindliness
at
the
present
moment
grated
on
owen
ears
but
he
resolved
at
once
to
tell
the
whole
story
out
and
then
leave
it
to
the
earl
to
take
it
in
dudgeon
or
in
brotherly
friendship
as
he
might
please
desmond
said
he
can
you
not
guess
what
has
passed
between
me
and
your
sister
i
am
not
good
at
guessing
he
answered
brusquely
i
have
told
her
that
i
loved
her
and
would
have
her
for
my
wife
and
i
have
asked
her
to
love
me
in
return
there
was
an
open
manliness
about
this
which
almost
disarmed
the
earl
anger
he
had
felt
a
strong
attachment
to
fitzgerald
and
was
very
unwilling
to
give
up
his
friendship
but
nevertheless
he
had
an
idea
that
it
was
presumption
on
the
part
of
fitzgerald
of
hap
house
to
look
up
to
his
sister
between
himself
and
owen
the
coronet
never
weighed
a
feather
he
could
not
have
abandoned
his
boy
heart
to
the
man
fellowship
more
thoroughly
had
that
man
been
an
earl
as
well
as
himself
but
he
could
not
get
over
the
feeling
that
fitzgerald
worldly
position
was
beneath
that
of
his
sister
that
such
a
marriage
on
his
sister
part
would
be
a
mesalliance
doubting
therefore
and
in
some
sort
dismayed
and
in
some
sort
also
angry
he
did
not
at
once
give
any
reply
well
desmond
what
have
you
to
say
to
it
you
are
the
head
of
her
family
and
young
as
you
are
it
is
right
that
i
should
tell
you
tell
me
of
course
you
ought
to
tell
me
i
do
see
what
youngness
has
to
do
with
it
what
did
she
say
well
she
said
but
little
and
a
man
should
never
boast
that
a
lady
has
favoured
him
but
she
did
not
reject
me
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
after
all
honesty
and
truth
are
the
best
i
have
reason
to
think
that
she
loves
me
the
poor
young
lord
felt
that
he
had
a
double
duty
and
hardly
knew
how
to
perform
it
he
owed
a
duty
to
his
sister
which
was
paramount
to
all
others
but
then
he
owed
a
duty
also
to
the
friend
who
had
been
so
kind
to
him
he
did
not
know
how
to
turn
round
upon
him
and
tell
him
that
he
was
not
fit
to
marry
his
sister
and
what
do
you
say
to
it
desmond
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
it
would
be
a
very
bad
match
for
her
you
you
know
are
a
capital
fellow
the
best
fellow
going
there
is
nobody
about
anywhere
that
i
like
so
much
in
thinking
of
your
sister
you
should
put
that
out
of
the
question
yes
that
just
it
i
like
you
for
a
friend
better
than
any
one
else
but
clara
ought
ought
ought
ought
to
look
higher
you
would
say
yes
that
just
what
i
mean
i
do
want
to
offend
you
you
know
desmond
my
boy
i
like
you
the
better
for
it
you
are
a
fine
fellow
and
i
thoroughly
respect
you
but
let
us
talk
sensibly
about
this
though
your
sister
rank
is
high
oh
i
do
want
to
talk
about
rank
that
all
bosh
and
i
care
about
it
but
hap
house
is
a
small
place
and
clara
would
be
doing
well
and
what
more
i
am
quite
sure
the
countess
will
not
hear
of
it
you
wo
approve
then
no
i
ca
say
i
will
well
that
is
honest
of
you
i
am
very
glad
that
i
have
told
you
at
once
clara
will
tell
her
mother
and
at
any
rate
there
will
be
no
secrets
old
fellow
said
the
earl
then
they
shook
hands
and
fitzgerald
rode
off
towards
hap
house
lord
desmond
pondered
over
the
matter
some
time
standing
alone
near
the
lodge
and
then
walked
slowly
back
towards
the
mansion
he
had
said
that
rank
was
all
bosh
and
in
so
saying
had
at
the
moment
spoken
out
generously
the
feelings
of
his
heart
but
that
feeling
regarded
himself
rather
than
his
sister
and
if
properly
analyzed
would
merely
have
signified
that
though
proud
enough
of
his
own
rank
he
did
not
require
that
his
friends
should
be
of
the
same
standing
but
as
regarded
his
sister
he
certainly
would
not
be
well
pleased
to
see
her
marry
a
small
squire
with
a
small
income
chapter
iv
the
countess
the
countess
as
she
walked
back
with
her
daughter
towards
the
house
had
to
bethink
herself
for
a
minute
or
two
as
to
how
she
should
act
and
what
she
would
say
she
knew
she
felt
that
she
knew
what
had
occurred
if
her
daughter
manner
had
not
told
her
the
downcast
eyes
the
repressed
sobs
the
mingled
look
of
shame
and
fear
if
she
had
not
read
the
truth
from
these
she
would
have
learned
it
from
the
tone
of
fitzgerald
voice
and
the
look
of
triumph
which
sat
upon
his
countenance
and
then
she
wondered
that
this
should
be
so
seeing
that
she
had
still
regarded
clara
as
being
in
all
things
a
child
and
as
she
thought
further
she
wondered
at
her
own
fatuity
in
that
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
so
grossly
deceived
clara
said
she
what
is
all
this
oh
mamma
you
had
better
come
on
to
the
house
my
dear
and
speak
to
me
there
in
the
mean
time
collect
your
thoughts
and
remember
this
clara
that
you
have
the
honour
of
a
great
family
to
maintain
poor
clara
what
had
the
great
family
done
for
her
or
how
had
she
been
taught
to
maintain
its
honour
she
knew
that
she
was
an
daughter
and
that
people
called
her
lady
clara
whereas
other
young
ladies
were
only
called
miss
but
she
had
not
been
taught
to
separate
herself
from
the
ordinary
throng
of
young
ladies
by
any
other
distinction
her
great
family
had
done
nothing
special
for
her
nor
placed
before
her
for
example
any
grandly
noble
deeds
at
that
old
house
at
desmond
court
company
was
scarce
money
was
scarce
servants
were
scarce
she
had
been
confided
to
the
care
of
a
very
ordinary
governess
and
if
there
was
about
her
anything
that
was
great
or
good
it
was
intrinsically
her
own
and
by
no
means
due
to
intrinsic
advantages
derived
from
her
grand
family
why
should
she
not
give
what
was
so
entirely
her
own
to
one
whom
she
loved
to
one
by
whom
it
so
pleased
her
to
be
loved
and
then
they
entered
the
house
and
clara
followed
her
mother
to
the
countess
own
small
the
daughter
did
not
ordinarily
share
this
room
with
her
mother
and
when
she
entered
it
she
seldom
did
so
with
pleasurable
emotion
at
the
present
moment
she
had
hardly
strength
to
close
the
door
after
her
and
now
clara
what
is
all
this
said
the
countess
sitting
down
in
her
accustomed
chair
all
which
mamma
can
any
one
blame
her
in
that
she
so
far
equivocated
clara
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
what
has
there
been
between
you
and
mr
fitzgerald
the
wretch
sat
silent
for
a
while
sustaining
the
scrutiny
of
her
mother
gaze
and
then
falling
from
her
chair
on
to
her
knees
she
hid
her
face
in
her
mother
lap
exclaiming
oh
mamma
mamma
do
not
look
at
me
like
that
lady
desmond
heart
was
somewhat
softened
by
this
appeal
nor
would
i
have
it
thought
that
she
was
a
cruel
woman
or
an
unnatural
mother
it
had
not
been
her
lot
to
make
an
absolute
dearest
heartiest
friend
of
her
daughter
as
some
mothers
do
a
friend
between
whom
and
herself
there
should
be
nay
could
be
no
secrets
she
could
not
become
young
again
in
sharing
the
romance
of
her
daughter
love
in
enjoying
the
gaieties
of
her
daughter
balls
in
planning
dresses
amusements
and
triumphs
with
her
child
some
mothers
can
do
this
and
they
i
think
are
the
mothers
who
enjoy
most
fully
the
delights
of
maternity
this
was
not
the
case
with
lady
desmond
but
yet
she
loved
her
child
and
would
have
made
any
reasonable
sacrifice
for
what
she
regarded
as
that
child
welfare
but
my
dear
she
said
in
a
softened
tone
you
must
tell
me
what
has
occurred
do
you
not
know
that
it
is
my
duty
to
ask
and
yours
to
tell
me
it
can
not
be
right
that
there
should
be
any
secret
understanding
between
yourself
and
fitzgerald
you
know
that
clara
do
you
not
yes
mamma
said
clara
remembering
that
her
lover
had
bade
her
tell
her
mother
everything
well
my
love
clara
story
was
very
simple
and
did
not
in
fact
want
any
telling
it
was
merely
the
old
tale
so
common
through
all
the
world
he
had
laughed
on
the
lass
with
his
bonny
black
eye
and
she
she
was
ready
to
go
to
the
mountain
to
hear
a
one
may
say
that
an
occurrence
so
very
common
could
not
want
much
telling
mamma
he
says
well
my
dear
he
says
oh
mamma
i
could
not
help
it
no
clara
you
certainly
could
not
help
what
he
might
say
to
you
you
could
not
refuse
to
listen
to
him
a
lady
in
such
a
case
when
she
is
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
a
gentleman
as
you
were
with
fitzgerald
is
bound
to
listen
to
him
and
to
give
him
an
answer
you
could
not
help
what
he
might
say
clara
the
question
now
is
what
answer
did
you
give
to
what
he
said
clara
who
was
still
kneeling
looked
up
piteously
into
her
face
sighed
bitterly
but
said
nothing
he
told
you
that
he
loved
you
i
suppose
yes
mamma
and
i
suppose
you
gave
him
some
answer
eh
my
dear
the
answer
to
this
was
another
long
sigh
but
clara
you
must
tell
me
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
know
whether
you
have
given
him
any
hope
and
if
so
how
much
of
course
the
whole
thing
must
be
stopped
at
once
young
as
you
are
you
can
not
think
that
a
marriage
with
owen
fitzgerald
would
be
a
proper
match
for
you
to
make
of
course
the
whole
thing
must
cease
at
once
at
once
here
there
was
another
piteous
sigh
but
before
i
take
any
steps
i
must
know
what
you
have
said
to
him
surely
you
have
not
told
him
that
you
have
any
feeling
for
him
warmer
than
ordinary
regard
lady
desmond
knew
what
she
was
doing
very
well
she
was
perfectly
sure
that
her
daughter
had
pledged
her
troth
to
owen
fitzgerald
indeed
if
she
made
any
mistake
in
the
matter
it
was
in
thinking
that
clara
had
given
a
more
absolute
assurance
of
love
than
had
in
truth
been
extracted
from
her
but
she
calculated
and
calculated
wisely
that
the
surest
way
of
talking
her
daughter
out
of
all
hope
was
to
express
herself
as
unable
to
believe
that
a
child
of
hers
would
own
to
love
for
one
so
much
beneath
her
and
to
speak
of
such
a
marriage
as
a
thing
absolutely
impossible
her
method
of
acting
in
this
manner
had
the
effect
which
she
desired
the
poor
girl
was
utterly
frightened
and
began
to
fear
that
she
had
disgraced
herself
though
she
knew
that
she
dearly
loved
the
man
of
whom
her
mother
spoke
so
slightingly
have
you
given
him
any
promise
clara
not
a
promise
mamma
not
a
promise
what
then
have
you
professed
any
regard
for
him
but
upon
this
clara
was
again
silent
then
i
suppose
i
must
believe
that
you
have
professed
a
regard
for
him
that
you
have
promised
to
love
him
no
mamma
i
have
not
promised
anything
but
when
he
asked
me
i
i
did
i
did
refuse
him
it
will
be
observed
that
lady
desmond
never
once
asked
her
daughter
what
were
her
feelings
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
inquire
even
within
her
own
heart
as
to
what
might
be
most
conducive
to
her
child
happiness
she
meant
to
do
her
duty
by
clara
and
therefore
resolved
at
once
to
put
a
stop
to
the
whole
affair
she
now
desisted
from
her
interrogatories
and
sitting
silent
for
a
while
looked
out
into
the
extent
of
flat
ground
before
the
house
poor
clara
the
while
sat
silent
also
awaiting
her
doom
clara
said
the
mother
at
last
all
this
must
of
course
be
made
to
cease
you
are
very
young
very
young
indeed
and
therefore
i
do
not
blame
you
the
fault
is
with
him
with
him
entirely
no
mamma
but
i
say
it
is
he
has
behaved
very
badly
and
has
betrayed
the
trust
which
was
placed
in
him
when
he
was
admitted
here
so
intimately
as
patrick
friend
i
am
sure
he
has
not
intended
to
betray
any
trust
said
clara
through
her
sobs
the
conviction
was
beginning
to
come
upon
her
that
she
would
be
forced
to
give
up
her
lover
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
hear
so
much
evil
spoken
of
him
he
has
not
behaved
like
a
gentleman
continued
the
countess
looking
very
stern
and
his
visits
here
must
of
course
be
altogether
discontinued
i
am
sorry
on
your
brother
account
for
patrick
was
very
fond
of
him
not
half
so
fond
as
i
am
thought
clara
to
herself
but
she
did
not
dare
to
speak
her
thoughts
out
loud
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
your
brother
young
as
he
is
will
not
continue
to
associate
with
a
friend
who
has
thought
so
slightly
of
his
sister
honour
of
course
i
shall
let
fitzgerald
know
that
he
can
come
here
no
more
and
all
i
want
from
you
is
a
promise
that
you
will
on
no
account
see
him
again
or
hold
any
correspondence
with
him
that
was
all
she
wanted
but
clara
timid
as
she
was
hesitated
before
she
could
give
a
promise
so
totally
at
variance
with
the
pledge
which
she
felt
that
she
had
given
hardly
an
hour
since
to
fitzgerald
she
knew
and
acknowledged
to
herself
that
she
had
given
him
a
pledge
although
she
had
given
it
in
silence
how
then
was
she
to
give
this
other
pledge
to
her
mother
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
hesitate
said
lady
desmond
looking
as
though
she
were
thunderstruck
at
the
existence
of
such
hesitation
you
do
not
wish
me
to
suppose
that
you
intend
to
persevere
in
such
insanity
clara
i
must
have
from
you
a
distinct
promise
or
what
might
be
the
dreadful
alternative
the
countess
did
not
at
that
minute
say
she
perhaps
thought
that
her
countenance
might
be
more
effective
than
her
speech
and
in
thinking
so
she
was
probably
right
it
must
be
remembered
that
clara
desmond
was
as
yet
only
seventeen
and
that
she
was
young
even
for
that
age
it
must
be
remembered
also
that
she
knew
nothing
of
the
world
ways
of
her
own
privileges
as
a
creature
with
a
soul
and
heart
of
her
own
or
of
what
might
be
the
true
extent
of
her
mother
rights
over
her
she
had
not
in
her
enough
of
matured
thought
to
teach
her
to
say
that
she
would
make
no
promise
that
should
bind
her
for
ever
but
that
for
the
present
in
her
present
state
she
would
obey
her
mother
orders
and
thus
the
promise
was
exacted
and
given
if
i
find
you
deceiving
me
clara
said
the
countess
i
will
never
forgive
you
hitherto
lady
desmond
may
probably
have
played
her
part
well
well
considering
her
object
but
she
played
it
very
badly
in
showing
that
she
thought
it
possible
that
her
daughter
should
play
her
false
it
was
now
clara
turn
to
be
proud
and
indignant
mamma
she
said
holding
her
head
high
and
looking
at
her
mother
boldly
through
her
tears
i
have
never
deceived
you
yet
very
well
my
dear
i
will
take
steps
to
prevent
his
intruding
on
you
any
further
there
may
be
an
end
of
the
matter
now
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
has
endeavoured
to
use
his
influence
with
patrick
but
i
will
tell
your
brother
not
to
speak
of
the
matter
further
and
so
saying
she
dismissed
her
daughter
shortly
afterwards
the
earl
came
in
and
there
was
a
conference
between
him
and
his
mother
though
they
were
both
agreed
on
the
subject
though
both
were
decided
that
it
would
not
do
for
clara
to
throw
herself
away
on
a
county
cork
squire
with
eight
hundred
a
year
a
cadet
in
his
family
and
a
man
likely
to
rise
to
nothing
still
the
earl
would
not
hear
him
abused
but
patrick
he
must
not
come
here
any
more
said
the
countess
well
i
suppose
not
but
it
will
be
very
dull
i
know
that
i
wish
clara
had
made
herself
such
an
ass
and
then
the
boy
went
away
and
talked
kindly
over
the
matter
to
his
poor
sister
but
the
countess
had
another
task
still
before
her
she
must
make
known
the
family
resolution
to
owen
fitzgerald
when
her
children
had
left
her
one
after
the
other
she
sat
at
the
window
for
an
hour
looking
at
nothing
but
turning
over
her
own
thoughts
in
her
mind
hitherto
she
had
expressed
herself
as
being
very
angry
with
her
daughter
lover
so
angry
that
she
had
said
that
he
was
faithless
a
traitor
and
no
gentleman
she
had
called
him
a
dissipated
spendthrift
and
had
threatened
his
future
wife
if
ever
he
should
have
one
with
every
kind
of
misery
that
could
fall
to
a
woman
lot
but
now
she
began
to
think
of
him
perhaps
more
kindly
she
had
been
very
angry
with
him
and
the
more
so
because
she
had
such
cause
to
be
angry
with
herself
with
her
own
lack
of
judgment
her
own
ignorance
of
the
man
character
her
own
folly
with
reference
to
her
daughter
she
had
never
asked
herself
whether
she
loved
fitzgerald
had
never
done
so
till
now
but
now
she
knew
that
the
sharpest
blow
she
had
received
that
day
was
the
assurance
that
he
was
indifferent
to
herself
she
had
never
thought
herself
too
old
to
be
on
an
equality
with
him
on
such
an
equality
in
point
of
age
as
men
and
women
feel
when
they
learn
to
love
each
other
and
therefore
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
he
could
regard
her
daughter
as
other
than
a
child
to
lady
desmond
clara
was
a
child
how
then
could
she
be
more
to
him
and
yet
now
it
was
too
plain
that
he
had
looked
on
clara
as
a
woman
in
what
light
then
must
he
have
thought
of
that
woman
mother
and
so
with
saddened
heart
but
subdued
anger
she
continued
to
gaze
through
the
window
till
all
without
was
dusk
and
dark
there
can
be
to
a
woman
no
remembrance
of
age
so
strong
as
that
of
seeing
a
daughter
go
forth
to
the
world
a
married
woman
if
that
does
not
tell
the
mother
that
the
time
of
her
own
youth
has
passed
away
nothing
will
ever
bring
the
tale
home
it
had
not
quite
come
to
this
with
lady
desmond
clara
was
not
going
forth
to
the
world
as
a
married
woman
but
here
was
one
now
who
had
judged
her
as
fit
to
be
so
taken
and
this
one
was
the
very
man
of
all
others
in
whose
estimation
lady
desmond
would
have
wished
to
drop
a
few
of
the
years
that
encumbered
her
she
was
not
however
a
weak
woman
and
so
she
performed
her
task
she
had
candles
brought
to
her
and
sitting
down
she
wrote
a
note
to
owen
fitzgerald
saying
that
she
herself
would
call
at
hap
house
at
an
hour
named
on
the
following
day
she
had
written
three
or
four
letters
before
she
had
made
up
her
mind
exactly
as
to
the
one
she
would
send
at
first
she
had
desired
him
to
come
to
her
there
at
desmond
court
but
then
she
thought
of
the
danger
there
might
be
of
clara
seeing
him
of
the
danger
also
of
her
own
feelings
towards
him
when
he
should
be
there
with
her
in
her
own
house
in
the
accustomed
way
and
she
tried
to
say
by
letter
all
that
it
behoved
her
to
say
so
that
there
need
be
no
meeting
but
in
this
she
failed
one
letter
was
stern
and
arrogant
and
the
next
was
so
that
it
might
teach
him
to
think
that
his
love
for
clara
might
yet
be
successful
at
last
she
resolved
to
go
herself
to
hap
house
and
accordingly
she
wrote
her
letter
and
despatched
it
fitzgerald
was
of
course
aware
of
the
subject
of
the
threatened
visit
when
he
determined
to
make
his
proposal
to
clara
the
matter
did
not
seem
to
him
to
be
one
in
which
all
chances
of
success
were
desperate
if
he
thought
he
could
induce
the
girl
to
love
him
other
smaller
difficulties
might
be
made
to
vanish
from
his
path
he
had
now
induced
the
girl
to
own
that
she
did
love
him
but
not
the
less
did
he
begin
to
see
that
the
difficulties
were
far
from
vanishing
lady
desmond
would
never
have
taken
upon
herself
to
make
a
journey
to
hap
house
had
not
a
sentence
of
absolute
banishment
from
desmond
court
been
passed
against
him
fitzgerald
she
began
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
alone
with
him
you
will
understand
what
has
induced
me
to
seek
you
here
after
your
imprudence
with
lady
clara
desmond
i
could
not
of
course
ask
you
to
come
to
desmond
court
i
may
have
been
presumptuous
lady
desmond
but
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
been
imprudent
i
love
your
daughter
dearly
and
i
told
her
so
immediately
afterwards
i
told
the
same
to
her
brother
and
she
no
doubt
has
told
the
same
to
you
yes
she
has
fitzgerald
clara
as
you
are
well
aware
is
a
child
absolutely
a
child
much
more
so
than
is
usual
with
girls
of
her
age
the
knowledge
of
this
should
i
think
have
protected
her
from
your
advances
but
i
absolutely
deny
any
such
knowledge
and
more
than
that
i
think
that
you
are
greatly
mistaken
as
to
her
character
mistaken
sir
as
to
my
own
daughter
yes
lady
desmond
i
think
you
are
i
think
on
such
a
matter
fitzgerald
i
need
not
trouble
you
for
an
expression
of
your
thoughts
nor
need
we
argue
that
subject
any
further
you
must
of
course
be
aware
that
all
ideas
of
any
such
marriage
as
this
must
be
laid
aside
on
what
grounds
lady
desmond
now
this
appeared
to
the
countess
to
be
rather
impudent
on
the
part
of
the
young
squire
the
reasons
why
he
owen
fitzgerald
of
hap
house
should
not
marry
a
daughter
of
an
earl
of
desmond
seemed
to
her
to
be
so
conspicuous
and
conclusive
that
it
could
hardly
be
necessary
to
enumerate
them
and
such
as
they
were
it
might
not
be
pleasant
to
announce
them
in
his
hearing
but
though
owen
fitzgerald
was
so
evidently
an
unfit
suitor
for
an
earl
daughter
it
might
still
be
possible
that
he
should
be
acceptable
to
an
earl
widow
ah
if
it
might
be
possible
to
teach
him
the
two
lessons
at
the
same
time
on
what
grounds
mr
fitzgerald
she
said
repeating
his
question
surely
i
need
hardly
tell
you
did
not
my
son
say
the
same
thing
to
you
yesterday
as
he
walked
with
you
down
the
avenue
yes
he
told
me
candidly
that
he
looked
higher
for
his
sister
and
i
liked
him
for
his
candour
but
that
is
no
reason
that
i
should
agree
with
him
or
which
is
much
more
important
that
his
sister
should
do
so
if
she
thinks
that
she
can
be
happy
in
such
a
home
as
i
can
give
her
i
do
not
know
why
he
or
why
you
should
object
you
think
then
that
i
might
give
her
to
a
blacksmith
if
she
herself
were
mad
enough
to
wish
it
i
thank
you
for
the
compliment
lady
desmond
you
have
driven
me
to
it
sir
i
believe
it
is
considered
in
the
world
said
he
that
is
in
our
country
that
the
one
great
difference
is
between
gentlemen
and
ladies
and
those
who
are
not
gentlemen
or
ladies
a
lady
does
not
degrade
herself
if
she
marry
a
gentleman
even
though
that
gentleman
rank
be
less
high
than
her
own
it
is
not
a
question
of
degradation
but
of
prudence
of
the
ordinary
caution
which
i
as
a
mother
am
bound
to
use
as
regards
my
daughter
oh
mr
fitzgerald
and
she
now
altered
her
tone
as
she
spoke
to
him
we
have
all
been
so
pleased
to
know
you
so
happy
to
have
you
there
why
have
you
destroyed
all
this
by
one
folly
the
folly
as
you
call
it
lady
desmond
has
been
premeditated
for
the
last
twelve
months
for
twelve
months
said
she
taken
absolutely
by
surprise
and
in
her
surprise
believing
him
yes
for
twelve
months
ever
since
i
began
to
know
your
daughter
i
have
loved
her
you
say
that
your
daughter
is
a
child
i
also
thought
so
this
time
last
year
in
our
last
winter
holidays
i
thought
so
then
and
though
i
loved
her
as
a
child
i
kept
it
to
myself
now
she
is
a
woman
and
so
thinking
i
have
spoken
to
her
as
one
i
have
told
her
that
i
loved
her
as
i
now
tell
you
that
come
what
may
i
must
continue
to
do
so
had
she
made
me
believe
that
i
was
indifferent
to
her
absence
perhaps
and
distance
might
have
taught
me
to
forget
her
but
such
i
think
is
not
the
case
and
you
must
forget
her
now
never
lady
desmond
nonsense
sir
a
child
that
does
not
know
her
own
mind
that
thinks
of
a
lover
as
she
does
of
some
new
toy
whose
first
appearance
in
the
world
was
only
made
the
other
night
at
your
cousin
house
you
ought
to
feel
ashamed
of
such
a
passion
mr
fitzgerald
i
am
very
far
from
being
ashamed
of
it
lady
desmond
at
any
rate
let
me
tell
you
this
my
daughter
has
promised
me
most
solemnly
that
she
will
neither
see
you
again
nor
have
any
correspondence
with
you
and
this
i
know
of
her
that
her
word
is
sacred
i
can
excuse
her
on
account
of
her
youth
and
young
as
she
is
she
already
sees
her
own
folly
in
having
allowed
you
so
to
address
her
but
for
you
fitzgerald
under
all
the
circumstances
i
can
make
no
excuse
for
you
is
yours
do
you
think
the
sort
of
house
to
which
a
young
girl
should
be
brought
as
a
bride
is
your
life
are
your
companions
of
that
kind
which
could
most
profit
her
i
am
sorry
that
you
drive
me
to
remind
you
of
these
things
his
face
became
very
dark
and
his
brow
stern
as
his
sins
were
thus
cast
into
his
teeth
and
from
what
you
know
of
me
lady
desmond
he
said
and
as
he
spoke
he
assumed
a
dignity
of
demeanour
which
made
her
more
inclined
to
love
him
than
ever
she
had
been
before
do
you
think
that
i
should
be
the
man
to
introduce
a
young
wife
to
such
companions
as
those
to
whom
you
allude
do
you
not
know
are
you
not
sure
in
your
own
heart
that
my
marriage
with
your
daughter
would
instantly
put
an
end
to
all
that
whatever
may
be
my
own
thoughts
and
they
are
not
likely
to
be
unfavourable
to
you
for
patrick
sake
i
mean
but
whatever
may
be
my
own
thoughts
i
will
not
subject
my
daughter
to
such
a
risk
and
fitzgerald
you
must
allow
me
to
say
that
your
income
is
altogether
insufficient
for
her
wants
and
your
own
she
has
no
fortune
i
want
none
with
her
and
but
i
will
not
argue
the
matter
with
you
i
did
not
come
to
argue
it
but
to
tell
you
with
as
little
offence
as
may
be
possible
that
such
a
marriage
is
absolutely
impossible
my
daughter
herself
has
already
abandoned
all
thoughts
of
it
her
thoughts
then
must
be
wonderfully
under
her
own
control
much
more
so
than
mine
are
lord
desmond
you
may
be
sure
will
not
hear
of
it
lord
desmond
can
not
at
present
be
less
of
a
child
than
his
sister
i
do
know
that
mr
fitzgerald
at
any
rate
lady
desmond
i
will
not
put
my
happiness
nor
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
in
it
his
sister
happiness
at
his
disposal
when
i
told
her
that
i
loved
her
i
did
not
speak
as
you
seem
to
think
from
an
impulse
of
the
moment
i
spoke
because
i
loved
her
and
as
i
love
her
i
shall
of
course
try
to
win
her
nothing
can
absolve
me
from
my
engagement
to
her
but
her
marriage
with
another
person
the
countess
had
once
or
twice
made
small
efforts
to
come
to
terms
of
peace
with
him
or
rather
to
a
truce
under
which
there
might
still
be
some
friendship
between
them
accompanied
however
by
a
positive
condition
that
clara
should
be
omitted
from
any
participation
in
it
she
would
have
been
willing
to
say
let
all
this
be
forgotten
only
for
some
time
to
come
you
and
clara
can
not
meet
each
other
but
fitzgerald
would
by
no
means
agree
to
such
terms
and
the
countess
was
obliged
to
leave
his
house
having
in
effect
only
thrown
down
a
gauntlet
of
battle
having
in
vain
attempted
to
extend
over
it
an
of
peace
he
helped
her
however
into
her
little
pony
carriage
and
at
parting
she
gave
him
her
hand
he
just
touched
it
and
then
taking
off
his
hat
bowed
courteously
to
her
as
she
drove
from
his
door
chapter
the
fitzgeralds
of
castle
richmond
what
idea
of
carrying
out
his
plans
may
have
been
prevalent
in
fitzgerald
mind
when
he
was
so
defiant
of
the
countess
it
may
be
difficult
to
say
probably
he
had
no
idea
but
felt
at
the
spur
of
the
moment
that
it
would
be
weak
to
yield
the
consequence
was
that
when
lady
desmond
left
hap
house
he
was
obliged
to
consider
himself
as
being
at
feud
with
the
family
the
young
lord
he
did
see
once
again
during
the
holidays
and
even
entertained
him
at
hap
house
but
the
earl
pride
would
not
give
way
an
inch
much
as
i
like
you
owen
i
can
not
do
anything
but
oppose
it
it
would
be
a
bad
match
for
my
sister
and
so
you
feel
if
you
were
in
my
place
and
then
lord
desmond
went
back
to
eton
after
that
they
none
of
them
met
for
many
months
during
this
time
life
went
on
in
a
very
triste
manner
at
desmond
court
lady
desmond
felt
that
she
had
done
her
duty
by
her
daughter
but
her
tenderness
to
clara
was
not
increased
by
the
fact
that
her
foolish
attachment
had
driven
fitzgerald
from
the
place
as
for
clara
herself
she
not
only
kept
her
word
but
rigidly
resolved
to
keep
it
twice
she
returned
unopened
and
without
a
word
of
notice
letters
which
owen
had
caused
to
be
conveyed
to
her
hand
it
was
not
that
she
had
ceased
to
love
him
but
she
had
high
ideas
of
truth
and
honour
and
would
not
break
her
word
perhaps
she
was
sustained
in
her
misery
by
the
remembrance
that
heroines
are
always
miserable
and
then
the
orgies
at
hap
house
became
hotter
and
faster
hitherto
there
had
perhaps
been
more
smoke
than
fire
more
calumny
than
sin
and
fitzgerald
when
he
had
intimated
that
the
presence
of
a
young
wife
would
save
him
from
it
all
had
not
boasted
falsely
but
now
that
his
friends
had
turned
their
backs
upon
him
that
he
was
banished
from
desmond
court
and
twitted
with
his
iniquities
at
castle
richmond
he
threw
off
all
restraint
and
endeavoured
to
enjoy
himself
in
his
own
way
so
the
orgies
became
fast
and
furious
all
which
of
course
reached
the
ears
of
poor
clara
desmond
during
the
summer
holidays
lord
desmond
was
not
at
home
but
owen
fitzgerald
was
also
away
he
had
gone
abroad
perhaps
with
the
conviction
that
it
would
be
well
that
he
and
the
desmonds
should
not
meet
and
he
remained
abroad
till
the
hunting
season
again
commenced
then
the
winter
came
again
and
he
and
lord
desmond
used
to
meet
in
the
field
there
they
would
exchange
courtesies
and
to
a
certain
degree
show
that
they
were
intimate
but
all
the
world
knew
that
the
old
friendship
was
over
and
indeed
all
the
world
all
the
county
cork
world
soon
knew
the
reason
and
so
we
are
brought
down
to
the
period
at
which
our
story
was
to
begin
we
have
hitherto
said
little
or
nothing
of
castle
richmond
and
its
inhabitants
but
it
is
now
time
that
we
should
do
so
and
we
will
begin
with
the
heir
of
the
family
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
speaking
herbert
fitzgerald
had
just
returned
from
oxford
having
completed
his
affairs
there
in
a
manner
very
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
father
mother
and
sisters
and
to
the
unqualified
admiration
of
his
aunt
miss
letty
i
am
not
aware
that
the
heads
of
colleges
and
supreme
synod
of
dons
had
signified
by
any
general
expression
of
sentiment
that
herbert
fitzgerald
had
so
conducted
himself
as
to
be
a
standing
honour
and
perpetual
glory
to
the
university
but
at
castle
richmond
it
was
all
the
same
as
though
they
had
done
so
there
are
some
parents
in
whose
estimation
not
to
have
fallen
into
disgrace
shows
the
highest
merit
on
the
part
of
their
children
herbert
had
not
been
rusticated
had
not
got
into
debt
at
least
not
to
an
extent
that
had
been
offensive
to
his
father
pocket
he
had
not
been
plucked
indeed
he
had
taken
honours
in
some
low
unnoticed
degree
unnoticed
that
is
at
oxford
but
noticed
at
castle
richmond
by
an
ovation
almost
by
a
triumph
but
herbert
fitzgerald
was
a
son
to
gladden
a
father
heart
and
a
mother
eye
he
was
not
handsome
as
was
his
cousin
owen
not
tall
and
stalwart
and
godlike
in
his
proportions
as
was
the
reveller
of
hap
house
but
nevertheless
and
perhaps
not
the
less
was
he
pleasant
to
look
on
he
was
smaller
and
darker
than
his
cousin
but
his
eyes
were
bright
and
full
of
good
humour
he
was
clean
looking
and
clean
made
pleasant
and
courteous
in
all
his
habits
attached
to
books
in
a
moderate
easy
way
but
no
bookworm
he
had
a
gentle
affection
for
bindings
and
was
fond
of
pictures
of
which
it
might
be
probable
that
he
would
some
day
know
more
than
he
did
at
present
addicted
to
gothic
architecture
and
already
proprietor
of
the
germ
of
what
was
to
be
a
collection
of
coins
owen
fitzgerald
had
called
him
a
prig
but
herbert
was
no
prig
nor
yet
was
he
a
pedant
which
word
might
perhaps
more
nearly
have
expressed
his
cousin
meaning
he
liked
little
bits
of
learning
the
easy
outsides
and
tags
of
classical
acquirements
which
come
so
easily
within
the
scope
of
the
memory
when
a
man
has
passed
some
ten
years
between
a
public
school
and
a
university
but
though
he
did
love
to
chew
the
cud
of
these
morsels
of
attic
grass
which
he
had
cropped
certainly
without
any
great
or
sustained
effort
he
had
no
desire
to
be
ostentatious
in
doing
so
or
to
show
off
more
than
he
knew
indeed
now
that
he
was
away
from
his
college
friends
he
was
rather
ashamed
of
himself
than
otherwise
when
scraps
of
quotations
would
break
forth
from
him
in
his
own
despite
looking
at
his
true
character
it
was
certainly
unjust
to
call
him
either
a
prig
or
a
pedant
he
was
fond
of
the
society
of
ladies
and
was
a
great
favourite
with
his
sisters
who
thought
that
every
girl
who
saw
him
must
instantly
fall
in
love
with
him
he
was
goodnatured
and
as
the
only
son
of
a
rich
man
was
generally
well
provided
with
money
such
a
brother
is
usually
a
favourite
with
his
sisters
he
was
a
great
favourite
too
with
his
aunt
whose
heart
however
was
daily
sinking
into
her
shoes
through
the
effect
of
one
great
terror
which
harassed
her
respecting
him
she
feared
that
he
had
become
a
puseyite
now
that
means
much
with
some
ladies
in
england
but
with
most
ladies
of
the
protestant
religion
in
ireland
it
means
one
may
almost
say
the
very
father
of
mischief
himself
in
their
minds
the
pope
with
his
lady
of
babylon
his
college
of
cardinals
and
all
his
community
of
pinchbeck
saints
holds
a
sort
of
second
of
his
own
at
oxford
and
there
his
high
priest
is
supposed
to
be
one
wicked
infamous
pusey
and
his
worshippers
are
wicked
infamous
puseyites
now
miss
letty
fitzgerald
was
strong
on
this
subject
and
little
inklings
had
fallen
from
her
nephew
which
robbed
her
of
much
of
her
peace
of
mind
it
is
impossible
that
these
volumes
should
be
graced
by
any
hero
for
the
story
does
not
admit
of
one
but
if
there
were
to
be
a
hero
herbert
fitzgerald
would
be
the
man
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
at
this
period
was
an
old
man
in
appearance
though
by
no
means
an
old
man
in
years
being
hardly
more
than
fifty
why
he
should
have
withered
away
as
it
were
into
premature
grayness
and
loss
of
the
muscle
and
energy
of
life
none
knew
unless
indeed
his
wife
did
know
but
so
it
was
he
had
one
may
say
all
that
a
kind
fortune
could
give
him
he
had
a
wife
who
was
devoted
to
him
he
had
a
son
on
whom
he
doted
and
of
whom
all
men
said
all
good
things
he
had
two
sweet
happy
daughters
he
had
a
pleasant
house
a
fine
estate
position
and
rank
in
the
world
had
it
so
pleased
him
he
might
have
sat
in
parliament
without
any
of
the
trouble
and
with
very
little
of
the
expense
which
usually
attends
aspirants
for
that
honour
and
as
it
was
he
might
hope
to
see
his
son
in
parliament
within
a
year
or
two
for
among
other
possessions
of
the
fitzgerald
family
was
the
land
on
which
stands
the
borough
of
kilcommon
a
borough
to
which
the
old
reform
bill
was
merciful
as
it
was
to
so
many
others
in
the
south
of
ireland
why
then
should
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
be
a
silent
melancholy
man
confining
himself
for
the
last
year
or
two
almost
entirely
to
his
own
study
giving
up
to
his
steward
the
care
even
of
his
own
demesne
and
farm
never
going
to
the
houses
of
his
friends
and
rarely
welcoming
them
to
his
rarely
as
it
was
and
never
as
it
would
have
been
had
he
been
always
allowed
to
have
his
own
way
people
in
the
surrounding
neighbourhood
had
begun
to
say
that
sir
thomas
sorrow
had
sprung
from
shortness
of
cash
and
that
money
was
not
so
easily
to
be
had
at
castle
richmond
as
was
the
case
some
ten
years
since
if
this
were
so
the
dearth
of
that
very
useful
article
could
not
have
in
any
degree
arisen
from
extravagance
it
was
well
known
that
sir
thomas
estate
was
large
being
of
a
value
according
to
that
public
and
which
the
neighbours
of
a
rich
man
always
carry
in
their
heads
amounting
to
twelve
or
fourteen
thousand
a
year
now
sir
thomas
had
come
into
the
unencumbered
possession
of
this
at
an
early
age
and
had
never
been
extravagant
himself
or
in
his
family
his
estates
were
strictly
entailed
and
therefore
as
he
had
only
a
life
interest
in
them
it
of
course
was
necessary
that
he
should
save
money
and
insure
his
life
to
make
provision
for
his
daughters
but
by
a
man
of
his
habits
and
his
property
such
a
burden
as
this
could
hardly
have
been
accounted
any
burden
at
all
that
he
did
however
in
this
mental
privacy
of
his
carry
some
heavy
burden
was
made
plain
enough
to
all
who
knew
him
and
lady
fitzgerald
was
in
many
things
a
counterpart
of
her
husband
not
in
health
so
much
as
in
spirits
she
also
was
old
for
her
age
and
woebegone
not
only
in
appearance
but
also
in
the
inner
workings
of
her
heart
but
then
it
was
known
of
her
that
she
had
undergone
deep
sorrows
in
her
early
youth
which
had
left
their
mark
upon
her
brow
and
their
trace
upon
her
inmost
thoughts
sir
thomas
had
not
been
her
first
husband
when
very
young
she
had
been
married
or
rather
given
in
marriage
to
a
man
who
in
a
very
few
weeks
after
that
union
had
shown
himself
to
be
perfectly
unworthy
of
her
her
story
or
so
much
of
it
as
was
known
to
her
friends
was
this
her
father
had
been
a
clergyman
in
dorsetshire
burdened
with
a
small
income
and
blessed
with
a
large
family
she
who
afterwards
became
lady
fitzgerald
was
his
eldest
child
and
as
miss
wainwright
mary
wainwright
had
grown
up
to
be
the
possessor
of
almost
perfect
female
loveliness
while
she
was
yet
very
young
a
widower
with
an
only
boy
a
man
who
at
that
time
was
considerably
less
than
thirty
had
come
into
her
father
parish
having
rented
there
a
small
this
gentleman
we
will
so
call
him
in
lack
of
some
other
term
immediately
became
possessed
of
an
establishment
at
any
rate
eminently
respectable
he
had
three
hunters
two
grooms
and
a
gig
and
on
sundays
went
to
church
with
a
in
his
hand
and
a
black
coat
on
his
back
what
more
could
be
desired
to
prove
his
respectability
he
had
not
been
there
a
month
before
he
was
intimate
in
the
house
before
two
months
had
passed
he
was
engaged
to
the
daughter
before
the
full
quarter
had
flown
by
he
and
the
daughter
were
man
and
wife
and
in
five
months
from
the
time
of
his
first
appearance
in
the
dorsetshire
parish
he
had
flown
from
his
creditors
leaving
behind
him
his
three
horses
his
two
grooms
his
gig
his
wife
and
his
little
boy
the
dorsetshire
neighbours
and
especially
the
dorsetshire
ladies
had
at
first
been
loud
in
their
envious
exclamations
as
to
miss
wainwright
luck
the
parson
and
the
parson
wife
and
poor
mary
wainwright
herself
had
according
to
the
sayings
of
that
moment
prevalent
in
the
county
used
most
unjustifiable
wiles
in
trapping
this
poor
rich
stranger
miss
wainwright
as
they
all
declared
had
not
clothes
to
her
back
when
she
went
to
him
the
matter
had
been
got
up
and
managed
in
most
indecent
hurry
so
as
to
rob
the
poor
fellow
of
any
chance
of
escape
and
thus
all
manner
of
evil
things
were
said
in
which
envy
of
the
bride
and
pity
of
the
bridegroom
were
equally
commingled
but
when
the
sudden
news
came
that
talbot
had
bolted
and
when
after
a
week
inquiry
no
one
could
tell
whither
talbot
had
gone
the
objurgations
of
the
neighbours
were
expressed
in
a
different
tone
then
it
was
declared
that
wainwright
had
sacrificed
his
beautiful
child
without
making
any
inquiry
as
to
the
character
of
the
stranger
to
whom
he
had
so
recklessly
given
her
the
pity
of
the
county
fell
to
the
share
of
the
poor
beautiful
girl
whose
welfare
and
happiness
were
absolutely
ruined
and
the
parson
was
pulled
to
pieces
for
his
sordid
parsimony
in
having
endeavoured
to
rid
himself
in
so
disgraceful
a
manner
of
the
charge
of
one
of
his
children
it
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
my
story
to
tell
here
of
the
anxious
family
councils
which
were
held
in
that
parsonage
parlour
during
the
time
of
that
daughter
courtship
there
had
been
misgivings
as
to
the
stability
of
the
wooer
there
had
been
an
anxious
wish
not
to
lose
for
the
penniless
daughter
the
advantage
of
a
wealthy
match
the
poor
girl
herself
had
been
much
as
to
her
own
feelings
but
let
them
have
been
right
or
let
them
have
been
wrong
at
that
parsonage
the
matter
was
settled
very
speedily
as
we
have
seen
and
mary
wainwright
became
talbot
when
she
was
still
almost
a
child
and
then
talbot
bolted
and
it
became
known
to
the
dorsetshire
world
that
he
had
not
paid
a
shilling
for
rent
or
for
butcher
meat
for
his
human
family
or
for
oats
for
his
equine
family
during
the
whole
period
of
his
sojourn
at
lodge
grand
references
had
been
made
to
a
london
banker
which
had
been
answered
by
assurances
that
talbot
was
as
good
as
the
bank
of
england
but
it
turned
out
that
the
assurances
were
forged
and
that
the
letter
of
inquiry
addressed
to
the
london
banker
had
been
intercepted
in
short
it
was
all
ruin
roguery
and
wretchedness
and
very
wretched
they
all
were
the
old
father
the
young
bride
and
all
that
parsonage
household
after
much
inquiry
something
at
last
was
discovered
the
man
had
a
sister
whose
whereabouts
was
made
out
and
she
consented
to
receive
the
child
on
condition
that
the
bairn
should
not
come
to
her
in
order
to
get
rid
of
this
burden
wainwright
with
great
difficulty
made
up
thirty
pounds
and
then
it
was
discovered
that
the
man
name
was
not
talbot
what
it
was
did
not
become
known
in
dorsetshire
for
the
poor
wife
resumed
her
maiden
name
with
very
little
right
to
do
so
as
her
kind
neighbours
observed
till
fortune
so
kindly
gave
her
the
privilege
of
bearing
another
honourably
before
the
world
and
then
other
inquiries
and
almost
endless
search
was
made
with
reference
to
that
miscreant
not
quite
immediately
for
at
the
moment
of
the
blow
such
search
seemed
to
be
but
of
little
use
but
after
some
months
when
the
first
stupor
arising
from
their
grief
had
passed
away
and
when
they
once
more
began
to
find
that
the
fields
were
still
green
and
the
sun
warm
and
that
god
goodness
was
not
at
an
end
and
the
search
was
made
not
so
much
with
reference
to
him
as
to
his
fate
for
tidings
had
reached
the
parsonage
that
he
was
no
more
the
period
was
that
in
which
paris
was
occupied
by
the
allied
forces
when
our
general
the
duke
of
wellington
was
paramount
in
the
french
capital
and
the
tuileries
and
champs
elys√©es
were
swarming
with
englishmen
report
at
the
time
was
brought
home
that
the
talbot
fighting
his
battles
under
the
name
of
chichester
had
been
seen
and
noted
in
the
of
paris
that
he
had
been
forcibly
extruded
from
some
such
chamber
for
of
a
gambling
debt
that
he
had
made
one
in
a
violent
fracas
which
had
subsequently
taken
place
in
the
french
streets
and
that
his
body
had
afterwards
been
identified
in
the
morgue
such
was
the
story
which
bit
by
bit
reached
wainwright
ears
and
at
last
induced
him
to
go
over
to
paris
so
that
the
absolute
and
truth
of
the
matter
might
be
ascertained
and
made
known
to
all
men
the
poor
man
search
was
difficult
and
weary
the
ways
of
paris
were
not
then
so
easy
to
an
englishman
as
they
have
since
become
and
wainwright
could
not
himself
speak
a
word
of
french
but
nevertheless
he
did
learn
much
so
much
as
to
justify
him
as
he
thought
in
instructing
his
daughter
to
wear
a
cap
that
talbot
had
been
kicked
out
of
a
in
the
rue
richelieu
was
absolutely
proved
an
acquaintance
who
had
been
with
him
in
dorsetshire
on
his
first
arrival
there
had
seen
this
done
and
bore
testimony
of
the
fact
that
the
man
so
treated
was
the
man
who
had
taken
the
in
england
this
same
acquaintance
had
been
one
of
the
party
adverse
to
talbot
in
the
row
which
had
followed
and
he
could
not
therefore
be
got
to
say
that
he
had
seen
him
dead
but
other
evidence
had
gone
to
show
that
the
man
who
had
been
so
extruded
was
the
man
who
had
perished
and
the
french
lawyer
whom
wainwright
had
employed
at
last
assured
the
poor
clergyman
that
he
might
look
upon
it
as
proved
had
he
not
been
dead
said
the
lawyer
the
inquiry
which
has
been
made
would
have
traced
him
out
alive
and
thus
his
daughter
was
instructed
to
put
on
her
widow
cap
and
her
mother
again
called
her
talbot
indeed
at
that
time
they
hardly
knew
what
to
call
her
or
how
to
act
in
the
wisest
and
most
befitting
manner
among
those
who
had
truly
felt
for
them
in
their
misfortunes
who
had
really
pitied
them
and
encountered
them
with
loving
sympathy
the
kindest
and
most
valued
friend
had
been
the
vicar
of
a
neighbouring
parish
he
himself
was
a
widower
without
children
but
living
with
him
at
that
time
and
reading
with
him
was
a
young
gentleman
whose
father
was
just
dead
a
baronet
of
large
property
and
an
irishman
this
was
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
it
need
not
now
be
told
how
this
young
man
sympathies
were
also
excited
or
how
sympathy
had
grown
into
love
in
telling
our
tale
we
fain
would
not
dwell
much
on
the
cradledom
of
our
meleager
the
young
widow
in
her
widow
cap
grew
to
be
more
lovely
than
she
had
ever
been
before
her
miscreant
husband
had
seen
her
they
who
remembered
her
in
those
days
told
wondrous
tales
of
her
surprising
loveliness
how
men
from
london
would
come
down
to
see
her
in
the
parish
church
how
she
was
talked
of
as
the
dorsetshire
venus
only
that
unlike
venus
she
would
give
a
hearing
to
no
man
how
sad
she
was
as
well
as
lovely
and
how
impossible
it
was
found
to
win
a
smile
from
her
but
though
she
could
not
smile
she
could
love
and
at
last
she
accepted
the
love
of
the
young
baronet
and
then
the
father
who
had
so
grossly
neglected
his
duty
when
he
gave
her
in
marriage
to
an
unknown
rascally
adventurer
endeavoured
to
atone
for
such
neglect
by
the
severest
caution
with
reference
to
this
new
suitor
further
inquiries
were
made
sir
thomas
went
over
to
paris
himself
with
that
other
clergyman
lawyers
were
employed
in
england
to
sift
out
the
truth
and
at
last
by
the
united
agreement
of
some
dozen
men
all
of
whom
were
known
to
be
worthy
it
was
decided
that
talbot
was
dead
and
that
his
widow
was
free
to
choose
another
mate
another
mate
she
had
already
chosen
and
immediately
after
this
she
was
married
to
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
such
was
the
early
of
lady
fitzgerald
and
as
this
was
widely
known
to
those
who
lived
around
her
for
how
could
such
a
as
that
remain
untold
no
one
wondered
why
she
should
be
gentle
and
silent
in
her
life
course
that
she
had
been
an
excellent
wife
a
kind
and
careful
mother
a
loving
neighbour
to
the
poor
and
courteous
neighbour
to
the
rich
all
the
county
cork
admitted
she
had
lived
down
envy
by
her
gentleness
and
soft
humility
and
every
one
spoke
of
her
and
her
retiring
habits
with
sympathy
and
reverence
but
why
should
her
husband
also
be
so
sad
nay
so
much
sadder
for
lady
fitzgerald
though
she
was
gentle
and
silent
was
not
a
sorrowful
woman
otherwise
than
she
was
made
so
by
seeing
her
husband
sorrow
she
had
been
to
him
a
loving
partner
and
no
man
could
more
tenderly
have
returned
a
wife
love
than
he
had
done
one
would
say
that
all
had
run
smoothly
at
castle
richmond
since
the
house
had
been
made
happy
after
some
years
of
waiting
by
the
birth
of
an
eldest
child
and
heir
but
nevertheless
those
who
knew
most
of
sir
thomas
saw
that
there
was
a
peacock
on
the
wall
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
further
a
word
or
two
as
to
the
other
ladies
of
the
family
and
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
mary
and
emmeline
fitzgerald
were
both
cheerful
girls
i
do
not
mean
that
they
were
boisterous
laughers
that
in
waltzing
they
would
tear
round
a
room
like
human
that
they
rode
well
to
hounds
as
some
young
ladies
do
and
some
young
ladies
do
ride
very
well
to
hounds
nor
that
they
affected
slang
and
decked
their
persons
with
odds
and
ends
of
masculine
costume
in
saying
that
they
were
cheerful
i
by
no
means
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
they
were
loud
they
were
pretty
too
but
neither
of
them
lovely
as
their
mother
had
been
hardly
indeed
so
lovely
as
that
pale
mother
was
now
even
in
these
latter
days
ah
how
very
lovely
that
pale
mother
was
as
she
sat
still
and
silent
in
her
own
place
on
the
small
sofa
by
the
slight
small
table
which
she
used
her
hair
was
gray
and
her
eyes
sunken
and
her
lips
thin
and
bloodless
but
yet
never
shall
i
see
her
equal
for
pure
feminine
beauty
for
form
and
outline
for
passionless
grace
and
sweet
gentle
womanly
softness
all
her
sad
tale
was
written
upon
her
brow
all
its
sadness
and
all
its
poetry
one
could
read
there
the
fearful
all
but
fatal
danger
to
which
her
childhood
had
been
exposed
and
the
daily
thanks
with
which
she
praised
her
god
for
having
spared
and
saved
her
but
i
am
running
back
to
the
mother
in
attempting
to
say
a
word
about
her
children
of
the
two
emmeline
the
younger
was
the
more
like
her
but
no
one
who
was
a
judge
of
outline
could
imagine
that
emmeline
at
her
mother
age
would
ever
have
her
mother
beauty
nevertheless
they
were
fine
handsome
girls
more
popular
in
the
neighbourhood
than
any
of
their
neighbours
well
educated
sensible
feminine
and
useful
fitted
to
be
the
wives
of
good
men
and
what
shall
i
say
of
miss
letty
she
was
ten
years
older
than
her
brother
and
as
strong
as
a
horse
she
was
great
at
walking
and
recommended
that
exercise
strongly
to
all
young
ladies
as
an
antidote
to
every
ill
from
love
to
chilblains
she
was
short
and
dapper
in
person
not
ugly
excepting
that
her
nose
was
long
and
had
a
little
bump
or
excrescence
at
the
end
of
it
she
always
wore
a
bonnet
even
at
meal
times
and
was
supposed
by
those
who
were
not
intimately
acquainted
with
the
mysteries
of
her
toilet
to
sleep
in
it
often
indeed
she
did
sleep
in
it
and
gave
unmusical
evidence
of
her
doing
so
she
was
not
illnatured
but
so
strongly
prejudiced
on
many
points
as
to
be
equally
disagreeable
as
though
she
were
so
with
her
as
with
the
world
in
general
religion
was
the
point
on
which
those
prejudices
were
the
strongest
and
the
peculiar
bent
they
took
was
horror
and
hatred
of
popery
as
she
lived
in
a
country
in
which
the
roman
catholic
was
the
religion
of
all
the
poorer
classes
and
of
very
many
persons
who
were
not
poor
there
was
ample
scope
in
which
her
horror
and
hatred
could
work
she
was
charitable
to
a
fault
and
would
exercise
that
charity
for
the
good
of
papists
as
willingly
as
for
the
good
of
protestants
but
in
doing
so
she
always
remembered
the
good
cause
she
always
clogged
the
flannel
petticoat
with
some
protestant
teaching
or
burdened
the
little
coat
and
trousers
with
the
pains
and
penalties
of
idolatry
when
her
brother
had
married
the
widow
talbot
her
anger
with
him
and
her
hatred
towards
her
had
been
extreme
but
time
and
conviction
had
worked
in
her
so
thorough
a
change
that
she
now
almost
worshipped
the
very
spot
in
which
lady
fitzgerald
habitually
sat
she
had
the
faculty
to
know
and
recognize
goodness
when
she
saw
it
and
she
had
known
and
recognized
it
in
her
brother
wife
him
also
her
brother
himself
she
warmly
loved
and
greatly
reverenced
she
deeply
grieved
over
his
state
of
body
and
mind
and
would
have
given
all
she
ever
had
even
her
very
self
to
restore
him
to
health
and
happiness
the
three
children
of
course
she
loved
and
petted
and
scolded
and
as
children
bothered
them
out
of
all
their
peace
and
quietness
to
the
girls
she
was
still
almost
as
great
a
torment
as
in
their
childish
days
nevertheless
they
still
loved
and
sometimes
obeyed
her
of
herbert
she
stood
somewhat
more
in
awe
he
was
the
future
head
of
the
family
and
already
a
bachelor
of
arts
in
a
very
few
years
he
would
probably
assume
the
higher
title
of
a
married
man
of
arts
she
thought
and
perhaps
the
less
formidable
one
of
a
member
of
parliament
also
him
therefore
she
treated
with
deference
but
alas
what
if
he
should
become
a
puseyite
chapter
vi
the
kanturk
hotel
south
main
street
cork
all
the
world
no
doubt
knows
south
main
street
in
the
city
of
cork
in
the
ould
ancient
days
south
and
north
main
streets
formed
the
chief
thoroughfare
through
the
city
and
hence
of
course
they
derived
their
names
but
now
since
patrick
street
and
grand
parade
and
the
south
mall
have
grown
up
main
street
has
but
little
honour
it
is
crowded
with
tobacconists
and
grocers
the
houses
are
dirty
and
the
street
is
narrow
fashionable
ladies
never
visit
it
for
their
shopping
nor
would
any
respectable
commercial
gent
stop
at
an
inn
within
its
purlieus
but
here
in
south
main
street
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
there
was
an
inn
or
called
the
kanturk
hotel
in
dear
old
ireland
they
have
some
foibles
and
one
of
them
is
a
passion
for
high
nomenclature
those
who
are
accustomed
to
the
sort
of
establishments
which
are
met
with
in
england
and
much
more
in
germany
and
switzerland
under
the
name
of
hotels
might
be
surprised
to
see
the
place
in
south
main
street
which
had
been
dignified
with
the
same
appellation
it
was
a
small
dingy
house
of
three
stories
the
front
door
of
which
was
always
open
and
the
passage
strewed
with
damp
dirty
straw
on
the
side
as
you
entered
was
a
or
as
it
was
announced
to
be
by
an
appellation
painted
on
the
door
there
was
but
one
window
to
the
room
which
looked
into
the
street
and
was
always
clouded
by
a
curtain
the
floor
was
uncarpeted
nearly
black
with
dirt
and
usually
half
covered
with
fragments
of
damp
straw
brought
into
it
by
the
feet
of
customers
a
strong
smell
of
hot
whisky
and
water
always
prevailed
and
the
straggling
mahogany
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
whose
rickety
legs
gave
way
and
came
off
whenever
an
attempt
was
made
to
move
it
was
covered
by
small
greasy
circles
the
impressions
of
the
bottoms
of
tumblers
which
had
been
made
by
the
overflowing
tipple
over
the
chimney
there
was
a
round
mirror
the
framework
of
which
was
bedizened
with
all
manner
of
gilt
ornaments
which
had
been
cracked
and
twisted
and
mended
till
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
they
had
been
intended
to
represent
and
the
whole
affair
had
become
a
huge
receptacle
of
dust
which
fell
in
flakes
upon
the
when
it
was
invaded
there
was
a
second
table
opposite
the
window
more
rickety
than
that
in
the
centre
and
against
the
wall
opposite
to
the
fireplace
there
was
an
old
sideboard
in
the
drawers
of
which
tom
the
waiter
kept
knives
and
forks
and
and
bits
of
bread
and
dusters
there
was
a
sour
smell
as
of
old
rancid
butter
about
the
place
to
which
the
guests
sometimes
objected
little
inclined
as
they
generally
were
to
be
fastidious
but
this
was
a
tender
subject
and
not
often
alluded
to
by
those
who
wished
to
stand
well
in
the
good
graces
of
tom
many
things
much
annoyed
tom
but
nothing
annoyed
him
so
fearfully
as
any
assertion
that
the
air
of
the
kanturk
hotel
was
not
perfectly
sweet
and
wholesome
behind
the
was
the
bar
from
which
fanny
dispensed
dandies
of
punch
and
goes
of
brandy
to
her
customers
from
kanturk
for
at
this
as
at
other
similar
in
irish
towns
the
greater
part
of
the
custom
on
which
the
publican
depends
came
to
him
from
the
inhabitants
of
one
particular
country
district
a
large
vehicle
called
a
long
car
which
was
drawn
by
three
horses
and
travelled
over
a
mountain
road
at
the
rate
of
four
irish
miles
an
hour
came
daily
from
kanturk
to
cork
and
daily
returned
this
public
conveyance
stopped
in
cork
at
the
kanturk
hotel
and
was
owned
by
the
owner
of
that
house
in
partnership
with
a
brother
in
the
same
trade
located
in
kanturk
it
was
business
to
look
after
this
concern
to
see
to
the
passengers
and
the
booking
the
oats
and
hay
and
stabling
while
his
daughter
the
charming
fanny
took
care
of
the
house
and
dispensed
brandy
and
whisky
to
the
customers
from
kanturk
to
tell
the
truth
the
bar
was
a
much
more
alluring
place
than
the
and
fanny
a
more
alluring
personage
than
tom
the
waiter
this
elysium
however
was
not
open
to
all
comers
not
even
to
all
comers
from
kanturk
those
who
had
the
right
of
entry
well
knew
their
privilege
and
so
also
did
they
who
had
not
this
sanctum
was
screened
off
from
the
passage
by
a
window
which
opened
upwards
conveniently
as
is
customary
with
but
the
window
was
blinded
inside
by
a
red
curtain
so
that
stool
near
the
counter
her
father
wooden
and
the
old
horsehair
sofa
on
which
favoured
guests
were
wont
to
sit
were
not
visible
to
the
public
at
large
of
the
portion
of
this
establishment
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
much
it
professed
to
be
an
hotel
and
accommodation
for
sleeping
was
to
be
obtained
there
but
the
of
the
house
depended
but
little
on
custom
of
this
class
nor
need
i
say
much
of
the
kitchen
a
graphic
description
of
which
would
not
be
pleasing
here
lived
a
cook
who
together
with
tom
the
waiter
did
all
that
servants
had
to
do
at
the
kanturk
hotel
from
this
kitchen
lumps
of
beef
mutton
chops
and
potatoes
did
occasionally
emanate
all
perfumed
with
plenteous
onions
as
also
did
fried
eggs
with
bacon
an
inch
thick
and
other
culinary
messes
too
horrible
to
be
thought
of
but
drinking
rather
than
eating
was
the
staple
of
this
establishment
such
was
the
kanturk
hotel
in
south
main
street
cork
it
was
on
a
disagreeable
cold
sloppy
raw
winter
evening
an
evening
drizzling
sometimes
with
rain
and
sometimes
with
sleet
that
an
elderly
man
was
driven
up
to
the
door
of
the
hotel
on
a
car
or
jingle
as
such
conveniences
were
then
called
in
the
south
of
ireland
he
seemed
to
know
the
house
for
with
his
outside
coat
all
dripping
as
it
was
he
went
direct
to
the
and
as
fanny
opened
the
door
he
walked
into
that
warm
precinct
there
he
encountered
a
gentleman
dressed
one
would
say
rather
beyond
the
merits
of
the
establishment
who
was
taking
his
ease
at
full
length
on
fanny
sofa
and
drinking
some
hot
compound
which
was
to
be
seen
in
a
tumbler
on
the
just
above
his
head
it
was
now
six
in
the
evening
and
the
gentleman
no
doubt
had
dined
well
aby
here
i
am
as
large
as
life
but
as
cold
as
death
ugh
what
an
affair
that
coach
is
fanny
my
best
of
darlings
give
me
a
drop
of
something
that
best
for
warming
the
cockles
of
an
old
heart
a
young
wife
then
is
the
best
thing
in
life
to
do
that
mollett
said
fanny
sharply
preparing
however
at
the
same
time
some
mixture
which
might
be
taken
more
instantaneously
the
governor
had
enough
of
that
receipt
already
said
the
man
on
the
sofa
or
rather
the
man
now
off
the
sofa
for
he
had
slowly
arisen
to
shake
hands
with
the
new
comer
this
latter
person
proceeded
to
divest
himself
of
his
dripping
greatcoat
here
tom
said
he
bring
your
old
cyclops
eye
to
bear
this
way
will
you
go
and
hang
that
up
in
the
kitchen
not
too
near
the
fire
now
and
get
me
something
to
eat
none
of
your
mutton
chops
but
a
beefsteak
if
there
is
such
a
thing
in
this
benighted
place
well
aby
how
goes
on
the
war
it
was
clear
that
the
elderly
gentleman
was
quite
at
home
in
his
present
quarters
for
tom
far
from
resenting
such
impertinence
as
he
would
immediately
have
done
had
it
proceeded
from
an
ordinary
kanturk
customer
declared
that
he
would
do
his
honour
bidding
av
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
beefsteak
to
be
had
anywhere
in
the
city
of
cork
and
indeed
the
elderly
gentleman
was
a
person
of
whom
one
might
premise
judging
by
his
voice
and
appearance
that
he
would
probably
make
himself
at
home
anywhere
he
was
a
hale
hearty
man
of
perhaps
sixty
years
of
age
who
had
certainly
been
handsome
and
was
even
now
not
the
reverse
or
rather
one
may
say
that
he
would
have
been
so
were
it
not
that
there
was
a
low
restless
cunning
legible
in
his
mouth
and
eyes
which
robbed
his
countenance
of
all
manliness
he
was
a
hale
man
and
well
preserved
for
his
time
of
life
but
nevertheless
the
extra
rubicundity
of
his
face
and
certain
incipient
pimply
excrescences
about
his
nose
gave
tokens
that
he
lived
too
freely
he
had
lived
freely
and
were
it
not
that
his
constitution
had
been
more
than
ordinarily
strong
and
that
constant
exercise
and
exposure
to
air
had
much
befriended
him
those
pimply
excrescences
would
have
shown
themselves
in
a
more
advanced
stage
such
was
mollett
senior
matthew
mollett
with
whom
it
will
be
soon
our
fate
to
be
better
acquainted
the
gentleman
who
had
slowly
risen
from
the
sofa
was
his
son
mollett
junior
abraham
mollett
with
whom
also
we
shall
become
better
acquainted
the
father
has
been
represented
as
not
being
exactly
prepossessing
but
the
son
according
to
my
ideas
was
much
less
so
he
also
would
be
considered
handsome
by
some
persons
by
women
chiefly
of
the
fanny
class
whose
eyes
are
capable
of
recognizing
what
is
good
in
shape
and
form
but
can
not
recognize
what
is
good
in
tone
and
character
abraham
mollett
was
perhaps
some
thirty
years
of
age
or
rather
more
he
was
a
very
smart
man
with
a
profusion
of
dark
hair
with
dark
copious
mustachoes
and
mustachoes
being
then
not
common
as
they
are
now
added
to
his
otherwise
rakish
vulgar
appearance
with
various
rings
on
his
not
hands
with
a
frilled
front
to
his
not
lately
washed
shirt
with
a
velvet
collar
to
his
coat
and
boots
upon
his
feet
free
living
had
told
more
upon
him
young
as
he
was
than
upon
his
father
his
face
was
not
yet
pimply
but
it
was
red
and
bloated
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
protruding
his
hand
on
a
morning
was
unsteady
and
his
passion
for
brandy
was
stronger
than
that
for
beefsteaks
whereas
his
father
appetite
for
solid
food
had
never
flagged
those
who
were
intimate
with
the
family
and
were
observant
of
men
were
wont
to
remark
that
the
son
would
never
fill
the
father
shoes
these
family
friends
i
may
perhaps
add
were
generally
markers
at
head
grooms
at
or
other
men
of
that
sharp
discerning
class
seeing
that
i
introduce
these
gentlemen
to
my
readers
at
the
kanturk
hotel
in
south
main
street
cork
it
may
be
perhaps
as
well
to
add
that
they
were
both
englishmen
so
that
mistakes
on
that
matter
may
be
avoided
the
father
as
soon
as
he
had
rid
himself
of
his
upper
coat
his
dripping
hat
and
his
goloshes
stood
up
with
his
back
to
the
fire
with
his
hands
in
his
and
the
tails
of
his
coat
stuck
inside
his
arms
i
tell
you
aby
it
was
cold
enough
outside
that
infernal
coach
blessed
if
i
a
morsel
of
feeling
in
my
toes
yet
why
the
d
do
they
continue
the
railway
on
to
cork
it
as
much
as
a
life
is
worth
to
travel
in
that
sort
of
way
at
this
time
of
the
year
you
have
more
of
it
then
if
you
intend
going
out
of
town
said
the
son
well
i
do
know
that
i
shall
i
shall
take
a
day
to
consider
of
it
i
think
consideration
be
bothered
said
mollett
junior
strike
when
the
iron
hot
that
my
motto
the
father
here
turned
half
round
to
his
son
and
winked
at
him
nodding
his
head
slightly
towards
the
girl
thereby
giving
token
that
according
to
his
ideas
the
conversation
could
not
be
discreetly
carried
on
before
a
third
person
all
right
said
the
son
lifting
his
joram
of
brandy
and
water
to
his
mouth
an
action
in
which
he
was
immediately
imitated
by
his
father
who
had
now
received
the
means
of
doing
so
from
the
hands
of
the
fair
fanny
and
how
about
a
bed
my
dear
said
mollett
senior
that
a
matter
of
importance
too
or
will
be
when
we
are
getting
on
to
the
little
hours
oh
we
wo
turn
you
out
mollett
said
fanny
we
find
a
bed
for
you
never
fear
that
all
right
then
my
little
venus
and
now
if
i
had
some
dinner
i
sit
down
and
make
myself
comfortable
for
the
evening
as
he
said
this
fanny
slipped
out
of
the
room
and
ran
down
into
the
kitchen
to
see
what
tom
and
the
cook
were
doing
the
molletts
father
and
son
were
rather
more
than
ordinary
good
customers
at
the
kanturk
hotel
and
it
was
politic
therefore
to
treat
them
well
mollett
junior
moreover
was
almost
more
than
a
customer
and
for
the
sake
of
the
son
fanny
was
anxious
that
the
father
should
be
well
treated
well
governor
and
what
have
you
done
said
the
younger
man
in
a
low
voice
jumping
up
from
his
seat
as
soon
as
the
girl
had
left
them
alone
well
i
got
the
usual
remittance
from
the
man
in
bucklersbury
that
was
all
as
right
as
a
trivet
and
no
more
than
that
then
i
tell
you
what
it
is
we
must
be
down
on
him
at
once
but
you
forget
that
i
got
as
much
more
last
month
out
of
the
usual
course
come
aby
do
you
be
unreasonable
bother
i
tell
you
governor
if
he
do
and
then
miss
returned
to
her
sanctum
and
the
rest
of
the
conversation
was
necessarily
postponed
he
managed
to
get
you
a
lovely
steak
mollett
said
fanny
pronouncing
the
word
as
though
it
were
written
steek
and
beautiful
pickled
walnuts
have
we
aby
and
there
be
kidneys
biled
meaning
potatoes
by
the
time
the
ready
you
like
it
with
the
gravy
in
do
you
mr
mollett
and
as
she
spoke
she
drew
a
quartern
of
whisky
for
two
of
beamish
and
draymen
who
stood
outside
in
the
passage
and
drank
it
at
the
bar
the
lovely
steek
with
the
gravy
in
it
that
is
to
say
nearly
raw
was
now
ready
and
father
and
son
adjourned
to
the
next
room
well
tom
my
lad
of
wax
and
how
the
world
using
you
said
mollett
senior
there
ai
much
difference
then
said
tom
i
ai
no
younger
nor
yet
no
richer
than
when
yer
honour
left
us
and
what
to
be
sir
a
pint
of
stout
sir
as
soon
as
mollett
senior
had
finished
his
dinner
and
tom
had
brought
the
father
and
son
materials
for
making
they
both
got
their
knees
together
over
the
fire
and
commenced
the
confidential
conversation
which
miss
had
interrupted
on
her
return
to
the
they
spoke
now
almost
in
a
whisper
with
their
heads
together
over
the
fender
knowing
from
experience
that
what
tom
wanted
in
eyes
he
made
up
in
ears
and
what
did
prendergast
say
when
he
paid
you
the
rhino
asked
the
son
not
a
word
said
the
other
after
all
i
do
think
he
knows
any
more
than
a
ghost
what
he
pays
it
for
i
think
he
gets
fresh
instructions
every
time
but
any
ways
there
it
was
all
right
hall
right
indeed
i
do
believe
you
be
satisfied
to
go
on
getting
a
few
dribblets
now
and
then
like
that
and
then
if
anything
to
you
why
i
might
go
fish
how
aby
look
here
it
hall
very
well
governor
but
i
tell
you
what
since
you
started
off
i
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
it
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
this
wo
do
any
good
we
must
strike
a
blow
that
do
something
for
us
well
i
do
think
we
done
so
bad
already
taking
it
ah
that
because
you
have
the
pluck
to
strike
a
good
blow
now
i
just
let
you
know
what
i
propose
and
i
tell
you
fairly
governor
if
you
not
hear
reason
i
take
the
game
into
my
own
hands
the
father
looked
up
from
his
drink
and
scowled
at
his
son
but
said
nothing
in
answer
to
this
threat
by
g
i
will
continued
aby
it
no
use
and
i
mean
to
make
myself
understood
while
you
been
gone
i
been
down
to
that
place
you
seen
the
old
man
no
i
taken
that
step
yet
but
i
think
it
very
likely
i
may
before
long
if
you
wo
hear
reason
i
was
a
d
fool
aby
ever
to
let
you
into
the
affair
at
all
it
been
going
on
quiet
enough
for
the
last
ten
years
till
i
let
you
into
the
secret
well
never
mind
about
that
that
mischief
done
but
i
think
you
find
i
pull
you
through
a
deal
better
than
hever
you
have
pulled
through
yourself
you
already
making
twice
more
out
of
it
than
you
did
before
i
knew
it
as
i
was
saying
i
went
down
there
and
in
my
quiet
way
i
did
just
venture
on
a
few
hinquiries
i
be
bound
you
did
you
blow
it
all
in
about
another
month
and
then
it
be
up
with
the
lot
of
us
it
a
beautiful
place
a
lovely
spot
and
hall
in
prime
horder
they
say
it
fifteen
thousand
a
year
and
that
there
not
a
shilling
howing
on
the
whole
property
even
in
these
times
the
tenants
are
paying
the
rent
when
no
one
else
far
and
near
is
getting
a
penny
out
of
them
i
went
by
another
place
on
the
road
castle
desmond
they
call
it
and
i
wish
you
seen
the
difference
the
old
boy
must
be
rolling
in
money
i
do
believe
it
there
one
as
i
can
trust
has
told
me
he
hard
up
enough
sometimes
why
we
had
twelve
hundred
in
the
last
eight
months
twelve
hundred
and
what
that
but
dickens
governor
where
has
the
twelve
hundred
gone
i
only
seen
three
of
it
and
part
of
that
well
what
do
you
want
there
you
shark
you
these
last
words
were
addressed
to
tom
who
had
crept
into
the
room
certainly
without
much
preparatory
noise
i
was
only
wanting
the
thingumbob
yer
honour
said
tom
pretending
to
search
diligently
in
the
drawer
for
some
required
article
then
take
your
thingumbob
quickly
out
of
that
and
be
d
to
you
and
look
here
if
you
do
knock
at
the
door
when
next
you
come
in
by
heavens
i
throw
this
tumbler
at
your
yead
sure
and
i
will
yer
honour
said
tom
withdrawing
and
where
on
hearth
has
the
twelve
hundred
pounds
gone
asked
the
son
looking
severely
at
the
father
old
mollett
made
no
immediate
answer
in
words
but
putting
his
left
hand
to
his
right
elbow
began
to
shake
it
i
do
wonder
that
you
keep
hon
at
that
work
said
mollett
junior
reproachfully
you
never
by
any
chance
have
a
stroke
of
luck
well
i
have
been
unfortunate
lately
but
who
knows
what
coming
and
i
was
deucedly
sold
by
those
fellows
at
the
october
meeting
if
any
chap
ever
was
safe
i
ought
to
have
been
safe
then
but
hang
me
if
i
did
drop
four
hundred
of
sir
thomas
shiners
coolly
on
the
spot
that
was
the
only
big
haul
i
had
out
of
him
all
at
once
and
the
most
of
it
went
like
water
through
a
sieve
within
hours
after
i
touched
it
and
then
having
finished
this
pathetical
little
story
of
his
misfortune
mollett
senior
finished
his
glass
of
toddy
it
the
way
of
the
world
governor
and
it
no
use
sighing
after
spilt
milk
but
i
tell
you
what
i
propose
and
if
you
do
like
the
task
yourself
i
have
no
hobjection
in
life
to
take
it
into
my
own
hands
you
see
the
game
so
much
our
own
that
there
nothing
on
hearth
for
us
to
fear
i
do
know
that
if
we
were
all
blown
where
should
we
be
why
she
your
own
aby
there
that
confounded
fellow
at
the
keyhole
as
sure
as
my
name
matthew
and
if
he
hears
you
the
game
all
up
with
a
vengeance
lord
bless
you
what
could
he
hear
besides
talking
as
we
are
now
he
would
catch
a
word
even
if
he
were
in
the
room
itself
and
now
i
tell
you
what
it
is
do
you
go
down
yourself
and
make
your
way
into
the
hold
gentleman
room
just
send
your
own
name
in
boldly
nobody
will
know
what
that
means
except
himself
i
did
that
once
before
and
i
never
shall
forget
it
yes
you
did
it
once
before
and
you
have
had
a
steady
income
to
live
on
ever
since
not
such
an
income
as
you
might
have
had
not
such
an
income
as
will
do
for
you
and
me
now
that
we
both
know
so
well
what
a
fine
property
we
have
under
our
thumbs
but
nevertheless
that
little
visit
has
been
worth
something
to
you
upon
my
word
aby
i
never
suffered
so
much
as
i
did
that
day
i
did
know
till
then
that
i
had
a
soft
heart
soft
heart
oh
bother
such
stuff
as
that
always
makes
me
sick
if
i
anything
it
maudlin
your
former
visit
down
there
did
very
well
and
now
you
must
make
another
or
else
by
the
holy
poker
make
it
for
you
and
what
would
you
have
me
say
to
him
if
i
did
manage
to
see
him
perhaps
i
better
go
that
out
of
the
question
he
would
see
you
or
understand
who
you
were
and
then
you
make
a
row
and
it
would
all
come
out
and
the
fat
would
be
in
the
fire
well
i
guess
i
should
not
take
it
quite
quiet
if
they
did
treat
me
as
a
gentleman
should
be
treated
i
ai
always
if
put
upon
if
you
go
near
that
house
at
all
i
have
done
with
it
i
give
up
the
game
well
do
you
go
at
any
rate
first
perhaps
it
may
be
well
that
i
should
follow
after
with
a
reminder
do
you
go
down
and
just
tell
him
this
quite
coolly
remember
oh
i
shall
be
cool
enough
that
considering
hall
things
you
think
he
and
you
ought
to
well
just
divide
it
between
you
share
and
share
alike
say
it
fourteen
thousand
and
it
more
than
that
that
would
be
seven
for
him
and
seven
for
you
tell
him
you
agree
to
that
but
you
wo
take
one
farthing
less
aby
said
the
father
almost
overcome
by
the
grandeur
of
his
ideas
well
and
what
of
haby
what
the
matter
now
expect
him
to
shell
out
seven
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
why
not
he
do
a
deal
more
than
that
i
expect
if
he
were
quite
sure
that
it
would
make
all
things
serene
but
it
wo
and
therefore
you
must
make
him
another
hoffer
another
offer
yes
he
know
well
enough
that
you
be
thinking
of
his
death
and
for
all
they
do
say
he
might
pop
off
any
day
he
a
younger
man
than
me
aby
by
full
ten
years
what
of
that
you
may
pop
off
any
day
too
may
you
i
believe
you
old
fellows
do
think
of
dying
nigh
as
hoften
as
we
young
ones
you
young
ones
are
always
looking
for
us
old
ones
to
go
we
all
know
that
well
enough
that
when
you
got
anything
to
leave
behind
you
which
the
case
with
you
governor
just
at
present
but
what
i
was
saying
is
this
he
know
well
enough
that
you
can
split
upon
his
son
hafter
he
gone
every
bit
as
well
as
you
can
split
on
him
now
oh
i
always
looked
to
make
the
young
gentleman
pay
up
handsome
if
so
be
the
old
gentleman
went
off
the
hooks
and
if
so
be
he
and
i
should
go
off
together
like
why
you
carry
on
of
course
have
the
proofs
you
know
oh
i
should
should
i
well
we
look
to
them
but
i
tell
you
what
governor
the
best
way
is
to
make
all
that
safe
we
make
him
another
hoffer
for
a
regular
substantial
family
harrangement
a
family
arrangement
eh
yes
that
the
way
they
always
manage
things
when
great
family
hinterests
is
at
stake
let
him
give
us
a
cool
seven
thousand
a
year
between
us
while
he
alive
let
him
put
you
down
for
twenty
thousand
when
he
dead
that
come
out
of
the
young
gentleman
share
of
the
property
of
course
and
then
let
him
give
me
his
daughter
hemmeline
with
another
twenty
thousand
tacked
on
to
her
i
should
be
mum
then
for
hever
for
the
honour
of
the
family
the
father
for
a
moment
or
two
was
struck
dumb
by
the
magnitude
of
his
son
proposition
that
what
i
call
playing
the
game
firm
continued
the
son
do
you
lay
down
your
terms
before
him
substantial
and
then
stick
to
my
terms
sir
thomas
you
say
you
do
like
as
i
ca
halter
why
in
course
i
go
elsewhere
do
you
be
firm
to
that
and
you
see
how
the
game
go
and
you
think
he
give
you
his
daughter
in
marriage
why
not
i
honest
born
hai
i
and
she
a
bastard
but
aby
you
do
know
what
sort
of
people

are
you
know
what
her
breeding
has
been
d
her
breeding
i
know
this

get
a
deuced
pretty
fellow
for
her
husband
and
one
that
girls
as
good
as
her
has
hankered
hafter
long
enough
it
wo
do
governor
to
let
people
as
is
in
their
position
pick
and
choose
like
we
the
hupper
hand
and
we
must
do
the
picking
and
choosing
she
never
have
you
aby
not
if
her
father
went
down
on
his
knees
to
her
to
ask
her
oh
would
she
by
heaven
then
she
shall
and
that
without
any
kneeling
at
all
she
shall
have
me
and
be
deuced
glad
to
take

what
she
refuse
a
fellow
like
me
when
she
knows
that
she
and
all
belonging
to
her
be
turned
into
the
streets
if
she
do
have
me
i
clear
of
another
way
of
thinking
then
my
opinion
is
she
come
to
me
jumping
i
tell
you
what
governor
you
do
know
the
sex
mollett
senior
upon
this
merely
shook
his
head
perhaps
the
fact
was
that
he
knew
the
sex
somewhat
better
than
his
son
it
had
been
his
fate
during
a
portion
of
his
life
to
live
among
people
who
were
or
ought
to
have
been
gentlemen
he
might
have
been
such
himself
had
he
not
gone
wrong
in
life
from
the
very
but
his
son
had
had
no
such
opportunities
he
did
know
and
could
know
nothing
about
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
mistaken
aby
said
the
old
man
they
never
suffer
you
to
come
among
them
on
such
a
footing
as
that
they
sooner
go
forth
to
the
world
as
beggars
then
by
g
they
shall
go
forth
as
beggars
i
said
it
now
father
and
i
stick
to
it
you
know
the
stuff
i
made
of
as
he
finished
speaking
he
swallowed
down
the
last
half
of
a
third
glass
of
hot
spirits
and
water
and
then
glared
on
his
father
with
angry
eyes
and
a
red
almost
lurid
face
the
unfortunate
father
was
beginning
to
know
the
son
and
to
feel
that
his
son
would
become
his
master
shortly
after
this
they
were
interrupted
and
what
further
conversation
they
had
on
the
matter
that
night
took
place
in
their
joint
bedroom
to
which
uninviting
retreat
it
is
not
now
necessary
that
we
should
follow
them
chapter
vii
the
famine
year
they
who
were
in
the
south
of
ireland
during
the
winter
of
will
not
readily
forget
the
agony
of
that
period
for
many
many
years
preceding
and
up
to
that
time
the
increasing
swarms
of
the
country
had
been
fed
upon
the
potato
and
upon
the
potato
only
and
now
all
at
once
the
potato
failed
them
and
the
greater
part
of
eight
million
human
beings
were
left
without
food
the
destruction
of
the
potato
was
the
work
of
god
and
it
was
natural
to
attribute
the
sufferings
which
at
once
overwhelmed
the
unfortunate
country
to
god
anger
to
his
wrath
for
the
misdeeds
of
which
that
country
had
been
guilty
for
myself
i
do
not
believe
in
such
exhibitions
of
god
anger
when
wars
come
and
pestilence
and
famine
when
the
people
of
a
land
are
worse
than
decimated
and
the
living
hardly
able
to
bury
the
dead
i
can
not
coincide
with
those
who
would
deprecate
god
wrath
by
prayers
i
do
not
believe
that
our
god
stalks
darkly
along
the
clouds
laying
thousands
low
with
the
arrows
of
death
and
those
thousands
the
most
ignorant
because
men
who
are
not
ignorant
have
displeased
him
nor
if
in
his
wisdom
he
did
do
so
can
i
think
that
men
prayers
would
hinder
that
which
his
wisdom
had
seen
to
be
good
and
right
but
though
i
do
not
believe
in
exhibitions
of
god
anger
i
do
believe
in
exhibitions
of
his
mercy
when
men
by
their
folly
and
by
the
shortness
of
their
vision
have
brought
upon
themselves
penalties
which
seem
to
be
overwhelming
to
which
no
end
can
be
seen
which
would
be
overwhelming
were
no
aid
coming
to
us
but
our
own
then
god
raises
his
hand
not
in
anger
but
in
mercy
and
by
his
wisdom
does
for
us
that
for
which
our
own
wisdom
has
been
insufficient
but
on
no
christian
basis
can
i
understand
the
justice
or
acknowledge
the
propriety
of
asking
our
lord
to
abate
his
wrath
in
detail
or
to
alter
his
settled
purpose
if
he
be
wise
would
we
change
his
wisdom
if
he
be
merciful
would
we
limit
his
mercy
there
comes
upon
us
some
strange
disease
and
we
bid
him
to
stay
his
hand
but
the
disease
when
it
has
passed
by
has
taught
us
lessons
of
cleanliness
which
no
master
less
stern
would
have
made
acceptable
a
famine
strikes
us
and
we
again
beg
that
that
hand
may
be
stayed
beg
as
the
greeks
were
said
to
beg
when
they
thought
that
the
anger
of
phoebus
was
hot
against
them
because
his
priest
had
been
dishonoured
we
so
beg
thinking
that
god
anger
is
hot
also
against
us
but
lo
the
famine
passes
by
and
a
land
that
had
been
brought
to
the
dust
by
folly
is
once
more
prosperous
and
happy
if
this
was
ever
so
in
the
world
history
it
was
so
in
ireland
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
the
country
especially
in
the
south
and
west
had
been
brought
to
a
terrible
pass
not
as
so
many
said
and
do
say
by
the
idolatry
of
popery
or
by
the
sedition
of
demagogues
or
even
mainly
by
the
idleness
of
the
people
the
idolatry
of
popery
to
my
way
of
thinking
is
bad
though
not
so
bad
in
ireland
as
in
most
other
papist
countries
that
i
have
visited
sedition
also
is
bad
but
in
ireland
in
late
years
it
has
not
been
as
may
have
been
noted
at
ballingarry
and
other
places
where
endeavour
was
made
to
bring
sedition
to
its
proof
and
as
for
the
idleness
of
ireland
people
i
am
inclined
to
think
they
will
work
under
the
same
compulsion
and
same
persuasion
which
produce
work
in
other
countries
the
fault
had
been
the
lowness
of
education
and
consequent
want
of
principle
among
the
middle
classes
and
this
fault
had
been
found
as
strongly
marked
among
the
protestants
as
it
had
been
among
the
roman
catholics
young
men
were
brought
up
to
do
nothing
property
was
regarded
as
having
no
duties
attached
to
it
men
became
rapacious
and
determined
to
extract
the
uttermost
farthing
out
of
the
land
within
their
power
let
the
consequences
to
the
people
on
that
land
be
what
they
might
we
used
to
hear
much
of
absentees
it
was
not
the
absence
of
the
absentees
that
did
the
damage
but
the
presence
of
those
they
left
behind
them
on
the
soil
the
scourge
of
ireland
was
the
existence
of
a
class
who
looked
to
be
gentlemen
living
on
their
property
but
who
should
have
earned
their
bread
by
the
work
of
their
brain
or
failing
that
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
there
were
men
to
be
found
in
shoals
through
the
country
speaking
of
their
properties
and
boasting
of
their
places
but
who
owned
no
properties
and
had
no
places
when
the
matter
came
to
be
properly
sifted
most
englishmen
have
heard
of
in
ireland
the
term
is
so
common
that
no
man
can
not
have
heard
of
it
it
may
of
course
designate
a
very
becoming
sort
of
income
a
man
may
for
instance
take
a
plot
of
land
for
one
hundred
pounds
a
year
improve
and
build
on
it
till
it
be
fairly
worth
one
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
thus
enjoy
a
of
nine
hundred
pounds
nothing
can
be
better
or
fairer
but
in
ireland
the
management
was
very
different
men
there
held
tracts
of
ground
very
often
at
their
full
value
paying
for
them
such
proportion
of
rent
as
a
farmer
could
afford
to
pay
in
england
and
live
but
the
irish
tenant
would
by
no
means
consent
to
be
a
farmer
it
was
needful
to
him
that
he
should
be
a
gentleman
and
that
his
sons
should
be
taught
to
live
and
amuse
themselves
as
the
sons
of
gentlemen
barring
any
such
small
trifle
as
education
they
did
live
in
this
way
and
to
enable
them
to
do
so
they
underlet
their
land
in
small
patches
and
at
an
amount
of
rent
to
collect
which
took
the
whole
labour
of
their
tenants
and
the
whole
produce
of
the
small
patch
over
and
above
the
quantity
of
potatoes
absolutely
necessary
to
keep
that
tenant
body
and
soul
together
and
thus
a
state
of
things
was
engendered
in
ireland
which
discouraged
labour
which
discouraged
improvements
in
farming
which
discouraged
any
produce
from
the
land
except
the
potato
crop
which
maintained
one
class
of
men
in
what
they
considered
to
be
the
gentility
of
idleness
and
another
class
the
people
of
the
country
in
the
abjectness
of
poverty
it
is
with
thorough
rejoicing
almost
with
triumph
that
i
declare
that
the
idle
genteel
class
has
been
cut
up
root
and
branch
has
been
driven
forth
out
of
its
holding
into
the
wide
world
and
has
been
punished
with
the
penalty
of
extermination
the
poor
cotter
suffered
sorely
under
the
famine
and
under
the
pestilence
which
followed
the
famine
but
he
as
a
class
has
risen
from
his
bed
of
suffering
a
better
man
he
is
thriving
as
a
labourer
either
in
his
own
country
or
in
some
newer
for
him
better
land
to
which
he
has
emigrated
he
even
in
ireland
can
now
get
eight
and
nine
shillings
a
week
easier
and
with
more
constancy
than
he
could
get
four
some
fifteen
years
since
but
the
other
man
has
gone
and
his
place
is
left
happily
vacant
there
are
an
infinite
number
of
smaller
bearings
in
which
this
question
of
the
famine
and
of
agricultural
distress
in
ireland
may
be
regarded
and
should
be
regarded
by
those
who
wish
to
understand
it
the
manner
in
which
the
poor
law
was
first
rejected
and
then
accepted
and
then
if
one
may
say
so
swallowed
whole
by
the
people
the
way
in
which
emigration
has
affected
them
the
difference
in
the
system
of
labour
there
from
that
here
which
in
former
days
was
so
strong
that
an
agricultural
labourer
living
on
his
wages
and
buying
food
with
them
was
a
person
hardly
to
be
found
all
these
things
must
be
regarded
by
one
who
would
understand
the
matter
but
seeing
that
this
book
of
mine
is
a
novel
i
have
perhaps
already
written
more
on
a
dry
subject
than
many
will
read
such
having
been
the
state
of
the
country
such
its
wretchedness
a
merciful
god
sent
the
remedy
which
might
avail
to
arrest
it
and
we
we
deprecated
his
wrath
but
all
this
will
soon
be
known
and
acknowledged
acknowledged
as
it
is
acknowledged
that
new
cities
rise
up
in
splendour
from
the
ashes
into
which
old
cities
have
been
consumed
by
fire
if
this
beneficent
agency
did
not
from
time
to
time
disencumber
our
crowded
places
we
should
ever
be
living
in
narrow
alleys
with
stinking
gutters
and
supply
of
water
at
the
minimum
but
very
frightful
are
the
flames
as
they
rush
through
the
chambers
of
the
poor
and
very
frightful
was
the
course
of
that
violent
remedy
which
brought
ireland
out
of
its
misfortunes
those
who
saw
its
course
and
watched
its
victims
will
not
readily
forget
what
they
saw
slowly
gradually
and
with
a
voice
that
was
for
a
long
time
discredited
the
news
spread
itself
through
the
country
that
the
food
of
the
people
was
gone
that
his
own
crop
was
rotten
and
useless
each
cotter
quickly
knew
and
realized
the
idea
that
he
must
work
for
wages
if
he
could
get
them
or
else
go
to
the
poorhouse
that
the
crop
of
his
parish
or
district
was
gone
became
evident
to
the
priest
and
the
parson
and
the
squire
and
they
realized
the
idea
that
they
must
fall
on
other
parishes
or
other
districts
for
support
but
it
was
long
before
the
fact
made
itself
known
that
there
was
no
food
in
any
parish
in
any
district
when
this
was
understood
men
certainly
did
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
with
a
great
effort
much
abuse
at
the
time
was
thrown
upon
the
government
and
they
who
took
upon
themselves
the
management
of
the
relief
of
the
poor
in
the
were
taken
most
severely
to
task
i
was
in
the
country
travelling
always
through
it
during
the
whole
period
and
i
have
to
say
as
i
did
say
at
the
time
with
a
voice
that
was
not
very
audible
that
in
my
opinion
the
measures
of
the
government
were
prompt
wise
and
beneficent
and
i
have
to
say
also
that
the
efforts
of
those
who
managed
the
poor
were
as
a
rule
unremitting
honest
impartial
and
successful
the
feeding
of
four
million
starving
people
with
food
to
be
brought
from
foreign
lands
is
not
an
easy
job
no
government
could
bring
the
food
itself
but
by
striving
to
do
so
it
might
effectually
prevent
such
bringing
on
the
part
of
others
nor
when
the
food
was
there
on
the
quays
was
it
easy
to
put
it
in
due
proportions
into
the
four
million
mouths
some
mouths
and
they
alas
the
weaker
ones
would
remain
unfed
but
the
opportunity
was
a
good
one
for
slashing
philanthropical
censure
and
then
the
business
of
the
slashing
censorious
philanthropist
is
so
easy
so
exciting
and
so
pleasant
i
think
that
no
portion
of
ireland
suffered
more
severely
during
the
famine
than
the
counties
cork
and
kerry
the
poorest
parts
were
perhaps
the
parishes
lying
back
from
the
sea
and
near
to
the
mountains
and
in
the
midst
of
such
a
district
desmond
court
was
situated
the
region
immediately
round
castle
richmond
was
perhaps
better
the
tenants
there
had
more
means
at
their
disposal
and
did
not
depend
so
absolutely
on
the
potato
crop
but
even
round
castle
richmond
the
distress
was
very
severe
early
in
the
year
relief
committees
were
formed
on
one
of
which
young
herbert
fitzgerald
agreed
to
act
his
father
promised
and
was
prepared
to
give
his
best
assistance
both
by
money
and
countenance
but
he
pleaded
that
the
state
of
his
health
hindered
him
from
active
exertion
and
therefore
his
son
came
forward
in
his
stead
on
this
occasion
as
it
appeared
probable
that
he
would
do
on
all
others
having
reference
to
the
family
property
this
work
brought
people
together
who
would
hardly
have
met
but
for
such
necessity
the
priest
and
the
parson
of
a
parish
men
who
had
hitherto
never
been
in
a
room
together
and
between
whom
neither
had
known
anything
of
the
other
but
the
errors
of
his
doctrine
found
themselves
fighting
for
the
same
object
at
the
same
board
and
each
for
the
moment
laid
aside
his
religious
ferocity
gentlemen
whose
ancestors
had
come
over
with
strongbow
or
maybe
even
with
milesius
sat
cheek
by
jowl
with
retired
haberdashers
concerting
new
soup
kitchens
and
learning
on
what
smallest
modicum
of
pudding
made
from
indian
corn
a
family
of
seven
might
be
kept
alive
and
in
such
condition
that
the
father
at
least
might
be
able
to
stand
upright
the
town
of
kanturk
was
the
of
that
circle
to
which
herbert
fitzgerald
was
attached
in
which
also
would
have
been
included
the
owner
of
desmond
court
had
there
been
an
owner
of
an
age
to
undertake
such
work
but
the
young
earl
was
still
under
sixteen
and
the
property
was
represented
as
far
as
any
representation
was
made
by
the
countess
but
even
in
such
a
work
as
this
a
work
which
so
strongly
brought
out
what
there
was
of
good
among
the
upper
classes
there
was
food
for
jealousy
and
ill
will
the
name
of
owen
fitzgerald
at
this
time
did
not
stand
high
in
the
locality
of
which
we
are
speaking
men
had
presumed
to
talk
both
to
him
and
of
him
and
he
replied
to
their
censures
by
scorn
he
would
not
change
his
mode
of
living
for
them
or
allow
them
to
believe
that
their
interference
could
in
any
way
operate
upon
his
conduct
he
had
therefore
affected
a
worse
character
for
morals
than
he
had
perhaps
truly
deserved
and
had
thus
thrown
off
from
him
all
intimacy
with
many
of
the
families
among
whom
he
lived
when
therefore
he
had
come
forward
as
others
had
done
offering
to
join
his
and
the
clergyman
of
the
district
in
their
efforts
they
had
or
he
had
thought
that
they
had
looked
coldly
on
him
his
property
was
half
way
between
kanturk
and
mallow
and
when
this
occurred
he
turned
his
shoulder
upon
the
former
place
and
professed
to
act
with
those
whose
meetings
were
held
at
the
latter
town
thus
he
became
altogether
divided
from
that
castle
richmond
neighbourhood
to
which
he
was
naturally
attached
by
old
intimacies
and
family
ties
it
was
a
hard
time
this
for
the
poor
countess
i
have
endeavoured
to
explain
that
the
position
in
which
she
had
been
left
with
regard
to
money
was
not
at
any
time
a
very
easy
one
she
possessed
high
rank
and
the
name
of
a
countess
but
very
little
of
that
wealth
which
usually
constitutes
the
chief
advantage
of
such
rank
and
name
but
now
such
means
as
had
been
at
her
disposal
were
terribly
crippled
there
was
no
poorer
district
than
that
immediately
around
her
and
none
therefore
in
which
the
poor
rates
rose
to
a
more
fearful
proportion
of
the
rent
the
country
was
and
for
that
matter
still
is
divided
for
purposes
of
rating
into
electoral
districts
in
ordinary
times
a
man
or
at
any
rate
a
lady
may
live
and
die
in
his
or
her
own
house
without
much
noticing
the
limits
or
peculiarities
of
each
district
in
one
the
rate
may
be
one
and
a
penny
in
the
pound
in
another
only
a
shilling
but
the
difference
is
not
large
enough
to
create
inquiry
it
is
divided
between
the
landlord
and
the
tenant
and
neither
perhaps
thinks
much
about
it
but
when
the
demand
made
rises
to
seventeen
or
eighteen
shillings
in
the
pound
as
was
the
case
in
some
districts
in
those
days
when
out
of
every
pound
of
rent
that
he
paid
the
tenant
claimed
to
deduct
nine
shillings
for
poor
rates
that
is
half
the
amount
levied
then
a
landlord
becomes
anxious
enough
as
to
the
peculiarities
of
his
own
electoral
division
in
the
case
of
protestant
clergymen
the
whole
rate
had
to
be
paid
by
the
incumbent
a
gentleman
whose
amounted
to
perhaps
two
hundred
pounds
might
have
nine
tenths
of
that
sum
deducted
from
him
for
poor
rates
i
have
known
a
case
in
which
the
proportion
has
been
higher
than
this
and
then
the
tenants
in
such
districts
began
to
decline
to
pay
any
rent
at
all
in
very
many
cases
could
pay
no
rent
at
all
they
too
depended
on
the
potatoes
which
were
gone
they
too
had
been
subject
to
those
dreadful
demands
for
poor
rates
and
thus
a
landlord
whose
property
was
in
any
way
embarrassed
had
but
a
bad
time
of
it
the
property
from
which
lady
desmond
drew
her
income
had
been
very
much
embarrassed
and
for
her
the
times
were
very
bad
in
such
periods
of
misfortune
a
woman
has
always
some
friend
let
her
be
who
she
may
some
pair
of
broad
shoulders
is
forthcoming
on
which
may
be
laid
so
much
of
the
burden
as
is
by
herself
unbearable
it
is
the
great
privilege
of
womanhood
that
which
compensates
them
for
the
want
of
those
other
privileges
which
belong
exclusively
to
manhood
sitting
in
parliament
for
instance
preaching
sermons
and
going
on
at
this
time
lady
desmond
would
doubtless
have
chosen
the
shoulders
of
owen
fitzgerald
for
the
bearing
of
her
burden
had
he
not
turned
against
her
as
he
had
done
but
now
there
was
no
hope
of
that
those
broad
shoulders
had
burdens
of
their
own
to
bear
of
another
sort
and
it
was
at
any
rate
impossible
that
he
should
come
to
share
those
of
desmond
court
but
a
champion
was
forthcoming
one
indeed
whose
shoulders
were
less
broad
on
looking
at
whose
head
and
brow
lady
desmond
could
not
forget
her
years
as
she
had
done
while
owen
fitzgerald
had
been
near
her
but
a
champion
nevertheless
whom
she
greatly
prized
this
was
owen
cousin
herbert
fitzgerald
mamma
her
daughter
said
to
her
one
evening
as
they
were
sitting
together
in
the
only
room
which
they
now
inhabited
herbert
wants
us
to
go
to
that
place
near
kilcommon
and
says
he
will
send
the
car
at
two
i
suppose
i
can
go
there
were
two
things
that
lady
desmond
noticed
in
this
first
that
her
daughter
should
have
called
young
fitzgerald
by
his
christian
name
and
secondly
that
it
should
have
come
to
that
with
them
that
a
fitzgerald
should
send
a
vehicle
for
a
desmond
seeing
that
the
desmond
could
no
longer
provide
a
vehicle
for
herself
you
could
have
had
the
my
dear
oh
no
mamma
i
would
not
do
that
the
pony
was
now
the
only
quadruped
kept
for
the
countess
own
behoof
and
the
young
hunter
was
the
only
other
horse
in
the
desmond
court
stables
i
would
do
that
mamma
mary
and
emmeline
will
not
mind
coming
round
but
they
will
have
to
come
round
again
to
bring
you
back
yes
mamma
herbert
said
they
would
mind
it
we
want
to
see
how
they
are
managing
at
the
new
soup
kitchen
they
have
there
that
one
at
clady
is
very
bad
the
boiler
wo
boil
at
all
very
well
my
dear
only
mind
you
wrap
yourself
up
oh
yes
i
always
do
but
clara
and
lady
desmond
put
on
her
sweetest
smoothest
smile
as
she
spoke
to
her
daughter
yes
mamma
how
long
have
you
taken
to
call
young
fitzgerald
by
his
christian
name
oh
i
never
do
mamma
said
clara
with
a
blush
all
over
her
face
not
to
himself
i
mean
you
see
mary
and
emmeline
are
always
talking
about
him
and
therefore
you
mean
always
to
talk
about
him
also
no
mamma
but
one
ca
help
talking
about
him
he
is
doing
so
much
for
these
poor
people
i
do
think
he
ever
thinks
about
anything
else
from
morning
to
night
emmeline
says
he
always
goes
to
it
again
after
dinner
do
you
think
he
is
very
good
about
it
mamma
yes
my
dear
very
good
indeed
almost
good
enough
to
be
called
herbert
but
i
do
call
him
so
you
know
i
do
protested
clara
very
energetically
he
is
very
good
continued
the
countess
very
good
indeed
i
know
what
on
earth
we
should
do
without
him
if
he
were
my
own
son
he
could
hardly
be
more
attentive
to
me
then
i
may
go
with
the
girls
to
that
place
i
always
forget
the
name
gortnaclough
you
mean
yes
mamma
it
is
all
sir
thomas
property
there
and
they
have
got
a
regular
kitchen
beautifully
built
her
fitzgerald
says
with
a
regular
cook
i
do
wish
we
could
have
one
at
clady
fitzgerald
will
be
here
morning
and
i
will
talk
to
him
about
it
i
fear
we
have
not
sufficient
funds
there
no
that
just
it
i
do
wish
i
had
some
money
now
you
wo
mind
if
i
am
not
home
quite
early
we
all
mean
to
dine
there
at
the
kitchen
the
girls
will
bring
something
and
then
we
can
stay
out
the
whole
afternoon
it
wo
do
for
you
to
be
out
after
nightfall
clara
no
i
wo
mamma
they
did
want
me
to
go
home
with
them
to
castle
richmond
for
night
but
i
declined
that
and
clara
uttered
a
slight
sigh
as
though
she
had
declined
something
that
would
have
been
very
pleasant
to
her
and
why
did
you
decline
it
oh
i
do
know
i
did
know
whether
you
would
like
it
and
besides
besides
what
you
be
here
all
alone
mamma
the
countess
got
up
from
her
chair
and
coming
over
to
the
place
where
her
daughter
was
sitting
kissed
her
on
her
forehead
in
such
a
matter
as
that
i
do
want
you
to
think
of
me
my
dear
i
would
rather
you
went
out
i
must
remain
here
in
this
horrid
dull
wretched
place
but
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
be
buried
alive
i
would
much
rather
that
you
went
out
sometimes
no
mamma
i
will
remain
with
you
it
will
be
quite
right
that
you
should
go
to
castle
richmond
if
they
send
their
carriage
round
here
for
you
it
only
be
the
car
well
the
car
and
if
the
girls
come
all
that
way
out
of
their
road
in
the
morning
to
pick
you
up
it
will
be
only
civil
that
you
should
go
back
by
castle
richmond
and
you
would
enjoy
an
evening
there
with
the
girls
very
much
but
i
said
decidedly
that
i
would
not
go
tell
them
as
decidedly
that
you
have
changed
your
mind
and
will
be
delighted
to
accept
their
invitation
they
will
understand
that
it
is
because
you
have
spoken
to
me
but
mamma
you
will
like
going
will
you
not
yes
i
shall
like
it
and
so
that
matter
was
settled
on
the
whole
lady
desmond
was
inclined
to
admit
within
her
own
heart
that
her
daughter
had
behaved
very
well
in
that
matter
of
the
banishment
of
owen
fitzgerald
she
knew
that
clara
had
never
seen
him
and
had
refused
to
open
his
letters
very
little
had
been
said
upon
the
subject
between
the
mother
and
daughter
once
or
twice
owen
name
had
been
mentioned
and
once
when
it
had
been
mentioned
with
heavy
blame
on
account
of
his
alleged
sins
clara
had
ventured
to
take
his
part
people
delight
to
say
things
she
had
said
but
one
is
not
obliged
to
believe
them
all
from
that
time
lady
desmond
had
never
mentioned
his
name
rightly
judging
that
clara
would
be
more
likely
to
condemn
him
in
her
own
heart
if
she
did
not
hear
him
condemned
by
others
and
so
the
mother
and
daughter
had
gone
on
as
though
the
former
had
lost
no
friend
and
the
latter
had
lost
no
lover
for
some
time
after
the
love
adventure
clara
had
been
pale
and
drooping
and
the
countess
had
been
frightened
about
her
but
latterly
she
had
got
over
this
the
misfortune
which
had
fallen
so
heavily
upon
them
all
seemed
to
have
done
her
good
she
had
devoted
herself
from
the
first
to
do
her
little
quota
of
work
towards
lessening
the
suffering
around
her
and
the
effort
had
been
salutary
to
her
whether
or
no
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
did
still
think
of
owen
fitzgerald
her
mother
was
unable
to
surmise
from
the
fire
which
had
flashed
from
her
eyes
on
that
day
when
she
accused
the
world
of
saying
things
of
him
lady
desmond
had
been
sure
that
such
was
the
case
but
she
had
never
ventured
to
probe
her
heart
she
had
given
very
little
confidence
to
clara
and
could
not
therefore
and
did
not
expect
confidence
in
return
nor
was
clara
a
girl
likely
in
such
a
matter
to
bestow
confidence
on
any
one
she
was
one
who
could
hold
her
heart
full
and
yet
not
speak
of
her
heart
fulness
her
mother
had
called
her
a
child
and
in
some
respects
she
then
was
so
but
this
childishness
had
been
caused
not
by
lack
of
mental
power
but
want
of
that
conversation
with
others
which
is
customary
to
girls
of
her
age
this
want
had
in
some
respects
made
her
childish
for
it
hindered
her
from
expressing
herself
in
firm
tones
and
caused
her
to
blush
and
hesitate
when
she
spoke
but
in
some
respects
it
had
the
opposite
effect
and
made
her
older
than
her
age
for
she
was
thoughtful
silent
and
patient
of
endurance
latterly
since
this
dreary
had
come
upon
them
an
intimacy
had
sprung
up
between
clara
and
the
castle
richmond
girls
and
in
a
measure
too
between
clara
and
herbert
fitzgerald
lady
desmond
had
seen
this
with
great
pleasure
though
she
had
objected
to
owen
fitzgerald
for
her
daughter
she
had
no
objection
to
the
fitzgerald
name
herbert
was
his
father
only
son
and
heir
to
the
finest
property
in
the
county
at
any
rate
to
the
property
which
at
present
was
the
best
circumstanced
owen
fitzgerald
could
never
be
more
than
a
little
squire
but
herbert
would
be
a
baronet
utmost
ambition
would
be
to
live
at
hap
house
all
his
life
and
die
the
oracle
of
the
duhallow
hunt
but
herbert
would
be
a
member
of
parliament
with
a
house
in
london
a
daughter
of
the
house
of
desmond
might
marry
the
heir
of
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
and
be
thought
to
have
done
well
whereas
she
would
disgrace
herself
by
becoming
the
mistress
of
hap
house
lady
desmond
therefore
had
been
delighted
to
see
this
intimacy
it
had
been
in
no
spirit
of
that
she
had
remarked
to
her
daughter
as
to
her
use
of
that
christian
name
what
would
be
better
than
that
they
should
be
to
each
other
as
herbert
and
clara
but
the
cautious
mother
had
known
how
easy
it
would
be
to
frighten
her
timid
child
it
was
no
time
no
time
as
yet
to
question
her
heart
about
this
second
lover
if
lover
he
might
be
the
countess
was
much
too
subtle
in
her
way
to
frighten
her
child
heart
back
to
its
old
passion
that
passion
doubtless
would
die
from
want
of
food
let
it
be
starved
and
die
and
then
this
other
new
passion
might
spring
up
the
countess
of
desmond
had
no
idea
that
her
daughter
with
severe
had
taken
her
own
heart
to
task
about
this
former
lover
had
argued
with
herself
that
the
man
who
could
so
sin
could
live
such
a
life
and
so
live
in
these
fearful
times
was
unworthy
of
her
love
and
must
be
torn
out
of
her
heart
let
the
cost
be
what
it
might
of
such
high
resolves
on
her
daughter
part
nay
on
the
part
of
any
young
girl
lady
desmond
had
no
knowledge
clara
desmond
had
determined
slowly
determined
to
give
up
the
man
whom
she
had
owned
to
love
she
had
determined
that
duty
and
female
dignity
required
her
to
do
so
and
in
this
manner
it
had
been
done
not
by
the
childlike
forgetfulness
which
her
mother
attributed
to
her
and
so
it
was
arranged
that
she
should
stay
the
following
night
at
castle
richmond
chapter
viii
gortnaclough
and
berryhill
and
now
at
last
we
will
get
to
castle
richmond
at
which
place
seeing
that
it
gives
the
title
to
our
novel
we
ought
to
have
arrived
long
since
as
had
been
before
arranged
the
two
miss
fitzgeralds
did
call
at
desmond
court
early
on
the
following
day
and
were
delighted
at
being
informed
by
lady
desmond
that
clara
had
changed
her
mind
and
would
if
they
would
now
allow
her
stay
the
night
at
castle
richmond
the
truth
was
she
did
not
like
to
leave
me
said
the
countess
whispering
prettily
into
the
ear
of
the
eldest
of
the
two
girls
but
i
am
delighted
that
she
should
have
an
opportunity
of
getting
out
of
this
dull
place
for
a
few
hours
it
was
so
good
of
you
to
think
of
her
miss
fitzgerald
made
some
civil
answer
and
away
they
all
went
herbert
was
on
horseback
and
remained
some
minutes
after
them
to
discuss
her
own
difficulties
with
the
countess
and
to
say
a
few
words
about
that
clady
boiler
that
would
not
boil
clara
on
this
subject
had
opened
her
heart
to
him
and
he
had
resolved
that
the
boiler
should
be
made
to
boil
so
he
said
that
he
would
go
over
and
look
at
it
resolving
also
to
send
that
which
would
be
much
more
efficacious
than
himself
namely
the
necessary
means
and
workmen
for
bringing
about
so
desirable
a
result
and
then
he
rode
after
the
girls
and
caught
the
car
just
as
it
reached
gortnaclough
how
they
all
spent
their
day
at
the
soup
kitchen
which
however
though
so
called
partook
quite
as
much
of
the
character
of
a
how
they
studied
the
art
of
making
yellow
indian
meal
into
puddings
how
the
girls
wanted
to
add
milk
and
sugar
not
understanding
at
first
the
deep
principles
of
political
economy
which
soon
taught
them
not
to
waste
on
the
comforts
of
a
few
that
which
was
so
necessary
for
the
life
of
many
how
the
poor
women
brought
in
their
sick
ailing
children
accepting
the
proffered
food
but
bitterly
complaining
of
it
as
they
took
it
complaining
of
it
because
they
wanted
money
with
which
they
still
thought
that
they
could
buy
potatoes
all
this
need
not
here
or
now
be
described
our
present
business
is
to
get
them
all
back
to
castle
richmond
there
had
been
some
talk
of
their
dining
at
gortnaclough
because
it
was
known
that
the
ladies
at
desmond
court
dined
early
but
now
that
clara
was
to
return
to
castle
richmond
that
idea
was
given
up
and
they
all
got
back
to
the
house
in
time
for
the
family
dinner
mamma
said
emmeline
walking
first
into
the
lady
clara
has
come
back
with
us
after
all
and
is
going
to
stay
here
we
are
so
glad
lady
fitzgerald
got
up
from
her
sofa
and
welcomed
her
young
guest
with
a
kiss
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
come
she
said
very
good
indeed
you
wo
find
it
dull
i
hope
because
i
know
you
are
thinking
about
the
same
thing
as
these
children
lady
clara
muttered
some
sort
of
indistinct
little
protest
as
to
the
impossibility
of
being
dull
with
her
present
friends
oh
she
as
full
of
corn
meal
and
pints
of
soup
as
any
one
said
emmeline
and
knows
exactly
how
much
turf
it
takes
to
boil
fifteen
stone
of
pudding
do
you
clara
but
come
for
we
have
long
and
i
know
you
are
frozen
you
must
dress
with
us
dear
for
there
will
be
no
fire
in
your
own
room
as
we
did
expect
you
i
wish
we
could
get
them
to
like
it
said
clara
standing
with
one
foot
on
the
fender
in
the
middle
of
the
process
of
dressing
so
as
to
warm
her
toes
and
her
friend
emmeline
was
standing
by
her
with
her
arm
round
her
waist
i
do
think
we
shall
ever
do
that
said
mary
who
was
sitting
at
the
glass
brushing
her
hair
it
so
cold
and
heavy
and
uncomfortable
when
they
get
it
you
see
said
emmeline
though
they
did
only
have
potatoes
before
they
always
had
them
quite
warm
and
though
a
dinner
of
potatoes
seems
very
poor
they
did
have
it
altogether
in
their
own
houses
you
know
and
i
think
the
very
cooking
it
was
some
comfort
to
them
and
i
suppose
they
could
be
taught
to
cook
this
themselves
so
as
to
make
it
comfortable
in
their
own
cabins
said
clara
despondingly
herbert
says
it
impossible
said
mary
and
i
sure
he
knows
said
clara
they
would
waste
more
than
they
would
eat
said
emmeline
besides
it
is
so
hard
to
cook
it
as
it
should
be
cooked
sometimes
it
seems
impossible
to
make
it
soft
so
it
does
said
clara
sadly
but
if
we
could
only
have
it
hot
for
them
when
they
come
for
it
would
that
be
better
the
great
thing
is
to
have
it
for
them
at
all
said
mary
the
wise
for
she
had
been
studying
the
matter
more
deeply
than
her
friend
there
are
so
many
who
as
yet
get
none
herbert
says
that
the
millers
will
grind
up
the
husks
and
all
at
the
mills
so
as
to
make
the
most
of
it
that
what
makes
it
so
hard
to
cook
said
emmeline
how
very
wrong
of
them
protested
clara
but
is
herbert
going
to
have
a
mill
put
up
of
his
own
and
so
they
went
on
till
i
fear
they
kept
the
castle
richmond
dinner
waiting
for
full
fifteen
minutes
castle
richmond
too
would
have
been
a
dull
house
as
lady
fitzgerald
had
intimated
had
it
not
been
that
there
was
a
common
subject
of
such
vital
interest
to
the
whole
party
on
that
subject
they
were
all
intent
and
on
that
subject
they
talked
the
whole
evening
planning
preparing
and
laying
out
schemes
devising
how
their
money
might
be
made
to
go
furthest
discussing
deep
questions
of
political
economy
and
making
no
doubt
many
errors
in
their
discussions
lady
fitzgerald
took
a
part
in
all
this
and
so
occasionally
did
sir
thomas
indeed
on
this
evening
he
was
more
active
than
was
usual
with
him
he
got
up
from
his
and
came
to
the
table
in
order
that
he
might
pore
over
the
map
of
the
estate
with
them
for
they
were
dividing
the
property
into
districts
and
seeing
how
best
the
poor
might
be
visited
in
their
own
localities
and
then
as
he
did
so
he
became
liberal
liberal
indeed
he
always
was
but
now
he
made
offers
of
assistance
more
than
his
son
had
dared
to
ask
and
they
were
all
busy
contented
and
in
a
great
degree
joyous
joyous
though
their
work
arose
from
the
contiguity
of
such
infinite
misery
but
what
can
ever
be
more
joyous
than
efforts
made
for
lessening
misery
during
all
this
time
miss
letty
was
fast
asleep
in
her
own
but
let
no
one
on
that
account
accuse
her
of
a
hard
heart
for
she
had
nearly
walked
her
old
legs
off
that
day
in
going
about
from
cabin
to
cabin
round
the
demesne
but
we
must
consult
somers
about
that
mill
said
sir
thomas
oh
of
course
said
herbert
i
know
how
to
talk
somers
over
this
was
added
to
his
mother
and
the
girls
now
somers
was
the
agent
on
the
estate
this
mill
was
to
be
at
berryhill
a
spot
also
on
sir
property
but
in
a
different
direction
from
gortnaclough
there
was
there
what
the
americans
would
call
a
water
privilege
a
stream
to
which
some
fall
of
land
just
there
gave
power
enough
to
turn
a
mill
and
was
now
a
question
how
they
might
utilize
that
power
during
the
day
just
past
clara
had
been
with
them
but
they
were
now
talking
of
what
they
would
do
when
she
would
have
left
them
this
created
some
little
feeling
of
awkwardness
for
clara
had
put
her
whole
heart
into
the
work
at
gortnaclough
and
it
was
evident
that
she
would
have
been
so
delighted
to
continue
with
them
but
why
on
earth
need
you
go
home
lady
clara
said
herbert
oh
i
must
mamma
expects
me
you
know
of
course
we
should
send
word
indeed
i
must
send
to
clady
and
the
man
must
pass
by
desmond
court
gate
oh
yes
clara
and
you
can
write
a
line
it
would
be
such
a
pity
that
you
should
not
see
all
about
the
mill
now
that
we
have
talked
it
over
together
do
tell
her
to
stay
mamma
i
am
sure
i
wish
she
would
said
lady
fitzgerald
could
not
lady
desmond
manage
to
spare
you
for
one
day
she
is
all
alone
you
know
said
clara
whose
heart
however
was
bent
on
accepting
the
invitation
perhaps
she
would
come
over
and
join
us
said
lady
fitzgerald
feeling
however
that
the
subject
was
not
without
danger
sending
a
carriage
for
a
young
girl
like
lady
clara
did
very
well
but
it
might
not
answer
if
she
were
to
offer
to
send
for
the
countess
of
desmond
oh
mamma
never
goes
out
i
quite
sure
she
like
you
to
stay
said
herbert
after
you
were
all
gone
yesterday
she
said
how
delighted
she
was
to
have
you
go
away
for
a
little
time
and
she
did
say
she
thought
you
could
not
go
to
a
better
place
than
castle
richmond
i
am
sure
that
was
very
kind
of
her
said
lady
fitzgerald
did
she
said
clara
longingly
and
so
after
a
while
it
was
settled
that
she
should
send
a
line
to
her
mother
saying
that
she
had
been
persuaded
to
stay
over
one
other
night
and
that
she
should
accompany
them
to
inspect
the
site
of
this
embryo
mill
at
berryhill
and
i
will
write
a
line
to
the
countess
said
lady
fitzgerald
telling
her
how
impossible
it
was
for
you
to
hold
your
own
intention
when
we
were
all
attacking
you
on
the
other
side
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
on
the
following
day
they
were
to
leave
home
almost
immediately
after
breakfast
and
on
this
occasion
miss
letty
insisted
on
going
with
them
there
a
seat
on
the
car
i
know
herbert
she
said
for
you
mean
to
ride
and
i
just
as
much
interested
about
the
mill
as
any
of
you
i
afraid
the
day
would
be
too
long
for
you
aunt
letty
said
mary
we
shall
stay
there
you
know
till
after
four
not
a
bit
too
long
when
i
tired
i
shall
go
into
townsend
the
glebe
is
not
ten
minutes
drive
from
berryhill
the
rev
√¶neas
townsend
was
the
rector
of
the
parish
and
he
as
well
as
his
wife
were
fast
friends
of
aunt
letty
as
we
get
on
in
the
story
we
shall
i
trust
become
acquainted
with
the
rev
√¶neas
townsend
and
his
wife
it
was
ultimately
found
that
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
aunt
letty
and
so
the
party
was
made
up
they
were
all
standing
about
the
hall
after
breakfast
looking
up
their
shawls
and
cloaks
and
coats
and
herbert
was
in
the
act
of
taking
special
and
very
suspicious
care
of
lady
clara
throat
when
there
came
a
ring
at
the
door
the
visitor
whoever
he
might
be
was
not
kept
long
waiting
for
one
servant
was
in
the
hall
and
another
just
outside
the
front
door
with
the
car
and
a
third
holding
herbert
horse
i
wish
to
see
sir
thomas
said
a
man
voice
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
and
the
man
entered
the
hall
and
then
seeing
that
it
was
full
of
ladies
retreated
again
into
the
doorway
he
was
an
elderly
man
dressed
almost
more
than
well
for
there
was
about
him
a
slight
affectation
of
dandyism
and
though
he
had
for
the
moment
been
abashed
there
was
about
him
also
a
slight
swagger
good
morning
ladies
he
said
again
and
bowing
to
young
herbert
who
stood
looking
at
him
i
believe
sir
thomas
is
at
home
would
you
send
your
servant
in
to
say
that
a
gentleman
wants
to
see
him
for
a
minute
or
so
on
very
particular
business
i
am
a
little
in
a
hurry
like
the
door
of
the
was
ajar
so
that
lady
fitzgerald
who
was
sitting
there
tranquilly
in
her
own
seat
could
hear
the
voice
and
she
did
hear
it
and
knew
that
some
stranger
had
come
to
trouble
her
husband
but
she
did
not
come
forth
why
should
she
was
not
herbert
there
if
indeed
even
herbert
could
be
of
any
service
shall
i
take
your
card
in
to
sir
thomas
sir
said
one
of
the
servants
coming
forward
card
said
mollett
senior
out
loud
well
if
it
is
necessary
i
believe
i
have
a
card
and
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
greasy
and
extracted
from
it
a
piece
of
pasteboard
on
which
his
name
was
written
there
give
that
to
sir
thomas
i
do
think
there
much
doubt
but
that
he
see
me
and
then
uninvited
he
sat
himself
down
in
one
of
the
hall
chairs
sir
thomas
study
the
room
in
which
he
himself
sat
and
in
which
indeed
he
might
almost
be
said
to
live
at
present
for
on
many
days
he
only
came
out
to
dine
and
then
again
to
go
to
bed
was
at
some
little
distance
to
the
back
of
the
house
and
was
approached
by
a
passage
from
the
hall
while
the
servant
was
gone
the
ladies
finished
their
wrapping
and
got
up
on
the
car
oh
fitzgerald
said
clara
laughing
i
sha
be
able
to
breathe
with
all
that
on
me
look
at
mary
and
emmeline
said
he
they
have
got
twice
as
much
you
do
know
how
cold
it
is
you
had
better
have
the
fur
close
to
your
body
said
aunt
letty
look
here
and
she
showed
that
her
gloves
were
lined
with
fur
and
her
boots
and
that
she
had
gotten
some
nondescript
furry
article
of
attire
stuck
in
underneath
the
body
of
her
dress
but
you
must
let
me
have
them
a
little
looser
fitzgerald
said
clara
there
that
will
do
and
then
they
all
got
upon
the
car
and
started
herbert
was
perhaps
two
minutes
after
them
before
he
mounted
but
when
he
left
the
hall
the
man
was
still
sitting
there
for
the
servant
had
not
yet
come
back
from
his
father
room
but
the
clatter
of
his
horse
hoofs
was
still
distinct
enough
at
the
hall
door
when
the
servant
did
come
back
and
in
a
serious
tone
desired
the
stranger
to
follow
him
sir
thomas
will
see
you
said
the
servant
putting
some
stress
on
the
word
will
oh
i
did
not
doubt
that
the
least
in
the
world
said
mollett
as
he
followed
the
man
along
the
passage
the
morning
was
very
cold
there
had
been
rainy
weather
but
it
now
appeared
to
be
a
settled
frost
the
roads
were
rough
and
hard
and
the
man
who
was
driving
them
said
a
word
now
and
again
to
his
young
master
as
to
the
expediency
of
getting
frost
nails
put
into
the
horse
shoes
i
better
go
gently
herbert
it
may
be
he
might
come
down
at
some
of
these
pitches
so
they
did
go
gently
and
at
last
arrived
safely
at
berryhill
and
very
busy
they
were
there
all
day
the
inspection
of
the
site
for
the
mill
was
not
their
only
employment
here
also
was
an
establishment
for
distributing
food
and
a
crowd
of
poor
wretches
were
there
to
meet
them
not
that
at
that
time
things
were
so
bad
as
they
became
afterwards
men
were
not
dying
on
the
nor
as
yet
had
the
apathy
of
want
produced
its
terrible
cure
for
the
agony
of
hunger
the
time
had
not
yet
come
when
the
famished
living
skeletons
might
be
seen
to
reject
the
food
which
could
no
longer
serve
to
prolong
their
lives
though
this
had
not
come
as
yet
the
complaints
of
the
women
with
their
throngs
of
children
were
bitter
enough
and
it
was
too
to
hear
the
men
declare
that
they
had
worked
like
horses
and
that
it
was
hard
upon
them
now
to
see
their
children
starve
like
dogs
for
in
this
earlier
part
of
the
famine
the
people
did
not
seem
to
realize
the
fact
that
this
scarcity
and
want
had
come
from
god
though
they
saw
the
potatoes
rotting
in
their
own
gardens
under
their
own
eyes
they
still
seemed
to
think
that
the
rich
men
of
the
land
could
stay
the
famine
if
they
would
that
the
fault
was
with
them
that
the
famine
could
be
put
down
if
the
rich
would
but
stir
themselves
to
do
it
before
it
was
over
they
were
well
aware
that
no
human
power
could
suffice
to
put
it
down
nay
more
than
that
they
had
almost
begun
to
doubt
the
power
of
god
to
bring
back
better
days
they
strove
and
toiled
and
planned
and
hoped
at
berryhill
that
day
and
infinite
was
the
good
that
was
done
by
such
efforts
as
these
that
they
could
not
hinder
god
work
we
all
know
but
much
they
did
do
to
lessen
the
sufferings
around
and
many
were
the
lives
that
were
thus
saved
they
were
all
standing
behind
the
counter
of
a
small
store
that
had
been
hired
in
the
village
the
three
girls
at
least
for
aunt
letty
had
already
gone
to
the
glebe
and
herbert
was
still
down
at
the
water
privilege
talking
to
a
millwright
and
a
carpenter
this
was
a
place
at
which
indian
corn
flour
that
which
after
a
while
was
generally
termed
meal
in
those
famine
days
was
sold
to
the
poor
at
this
period
much
of
it
was
absolutely
given
away
this
plan
however
was
soon
found
to
be
injurious
for
hundreds
would
get
it
who
were
not
absolutely
in
want
and
would
then
sell
it
for
the
famine
by
no
means
improved
the
morals
of
the
people
and
therefore
it
was
found
better
to
sell
the
flour
to
sell
it
at
a
cheap
rate
considerably
less
sometimes
than
the
cost
price
and
to
put
the
means
of
buying
it
into
the
hands
of
the
people
by
giving
them
work
and
paying
them
wages
towards
the
end
of
these
times
when
the
full
weight
of
the
blow
was
understood
and
the
subject
had
been
in
some
sort
studied
the
general
rule
was
thus
to
sell
the
meal
at
its
true
price
hindering
the
exorbitant
profit
of
hucksters
by
the
use
of
large
stores
and
to
require
that
all
those
who
could
not
buy
it
should
seek
the
means
of
living
within
the
walls
of
workhouses
the
regular
established
workhouses
unions
as
they
were
called
were
not
as
yet
numerous
but
supernumerary
houses
were
provided
in
every
town
and
were
crowded
from
the
cellars
to
the
roofs
it
need
hardly
be
explained
that
no
general
rule
could
be
established
and
acted
upon
at
once
the
numbers
to
be
dealt
with
were
so
great
that
the
exceptions
to
all
rules
were
overwhelming
but
such
and
such
like
were
the
efforts
made
and
these
efforts
ultimately
were
successful
the
three
girls
were
standing
behind
the
counter
of
a
little
store
which
sir
thomas
had
hired
at
berryhill
when
a
woman
came
into
the
place
with
two
children
in
her
arms
and
followed
by
four
others
of
different
ages
she
was
a
gaunt
tall
creature
with
sunken
cheeks
and
hollow
eyes
and
her
clothes
hung
about
her
in
unintelligible
rags
there
was
a
crowd
before
the
counter
for
those
who
had
been
answered
or
served
stood
staring
at
the
three
ladies
and
could
hardly
be
got
to
go
away
but
this
woman
pressed
her
way
through
pushing
some
and
using
harsh
language
to
others
till
she
stood
immediately
opposite
to
clara
look
at
that
madam
she
cried
undoing
an
old
handkerchief
which
she
held
in
her
hand
and
displaying
the
contents
on
the
counter
is
that
what
the
likes
of
you
calls
food
for
poor
people
is
that
fit
to
give
to
children
would
any
av
ye
put
such
stuff
as
that
into
the
stomachs
of
your
own
bairns
and
she
pointed
to
the
mess
which
lay
revealed
upon
the
handkerchief
the
food
as
food
was
not
nice
to
look
at
and
could
not
have
been
nice
to
eat
or
probably
easy
of
digestion
when
eaten
feel
of
that
and
the
woman
rubbed
her
forefinger
among
it
to
show
that
it
was
rough
and
hard
and
that
the
particles
were
as
sharp
as
though
sand
had
been
mixed
with
it
the
stuff
was
indian
meal
which
had
been
improperly
subjected
at
first
to
the
full
heat
of
boiling
water
and
in
its
present
state
was
bad
food
either
for
children
or
grown
people
feel
of
that
said
the
woman
would
you
like
to
be
that
yourself
now
i
do
think
you
have
cooked
it
quite
enough
said
clara
looking
into
the
woman
face
half
with
fear
and
half
with
pity
and
putting
as
she
spoke
her
pretty
delicate
finger
down
into
the
nasty
daubed
mess
of
parboiled
yellow
flour
cooked
it
said
the
woman
scornfully
all
the
cooking
on
would
make
food
of
that
fit
for
a
christian
feel
of
the
roughness
of
it
and
she
turned
to
another
woman
who
stood
near
her
would
you
like
to
be
putting
sharp
points
like
that
into
your
bellies
it
was
quite
true
that
the
grains
of
it
were
hard
and
sharp
so
as
to
give
one
an
idea
that
it
would
make
good
eating
neither
for
women
nor
children
the
millers
and
dealers
who
of
course
made
their
profits
in
these
times
did
frequently
grind
up
the
whole
corn
without
separating
the
grain
from
the
husks
and
the
shell
of
a
grain
of
indian
corn
does
not
when
ground
become
soft
flour
this
woman
had
reason
for
her
complaints
as
had
many
thousands
reason
for
similar
complaints
do
be
throubling
the
ladies
kitty
said
an
old
man
standing
by
sure
and
were
you
glad
enough
to
be
getting
it
she
be
axing
the
ladies
to
go
home
wid
her
and
cook
it
for
her
after
giving
it
her
said
another
who
says
it
war
guv
me
said
the
angry
mother
did
i
buy
it
here
at
this
counter
with
mike
own
money
and
chaiting
us
they
are
give
me
back
my
money
and
she
looked
at
clara
as
though
she
meant
to
attack
her
across
the
counter
fitzgerald
is
going
to
put
up
a
mill
of
his
own
and
then
the
corn
will
be
better
ground
said
emmeline
fitzgerald
deprecating
the
woman
wrath
put
up
a
mill
said
the
woman
still
in
scorn
are
you
going
to
give
me
back
my
money
or
food
that
my
poor
bairns
can
ate
this
individual
little
difficulty
was
ended
by
a
donation
to
the
angry
woman
of
another
lot
of
meal
in
taking
away
which
she
was
careful
not
to
leave
behind
her
the
mess
which
she
had
brought
in
her
handkerchief
but
she
expressed
no
thanks
on
being
so
treated
the
hardest
burden
which
had
to
be
borne
by
those
who
exerted
themselves
at
this
period
was
the
ingratitude
of
the
poor
for
whom
they
worked
or
rather
i
should
say
thanklessness
to
call
them
ungrateful
would
imply
too
deep
a
reproach
for
their
convictions
were
that
they
were
being
ill
used
by
the
upper
classes
when
they
received
bad
meal
which
they
could
not
cook
and
even
in
their
extreme
hunger
could
hardly
eat
when
they
were
desired
to
leave
their
cabins
and
gardens
and
flock
into
the
wretched
barracks
which
were
prepared
for
them
when
they
saw
their
children
wasting
away
under
a
suddenly
altered
system
of
diet
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
to
expect
that
they
should
have
been
grateful
grateful
for
what
had
they
not
at
any
rate
a
right
to
claim
life
to
demand
food
that
should
keep
them
and
their
young
ones
alive
but
not
the
less
was
it
a
hard
task
for
delicate
women
to
work
hard
and
to
feel
that
all
their
work
was
unappreciated
by
those
whom
they
so
thoroughly
commiserated
whose
sufferings
they
were
so
anxious
to
relieve
it
was
almost
dark
before
they
left
berryhill
and
then
they
had
to
go
out
of
their
way
to
pick
up
aunt
letty
at
townsend
house
do
go
in
whatever
you
do
girls
said
herbert
we
should
never
get
away
indeed
we
wo
unpack
ourselves
again
before
we
get
home
will
we
clara
oh
i
hope
not
i
very
nice
now
and
so
warm
but
fitzgerald
is
not
townsend
very
queer
very
queer
indeed
but
you
must
say
a
word
about
her
before
aunt
letty
they
are
sworn
i
wo
of
course
but
fitzgerald
she
very
good
is
she
not
yes
in
her
way
only
it
a
pity
she
so
prejudiced
you
mean
about
religion
i
mean
about
everything
if
she
wears
a
bonnet
on
her
head
think
you
very
wicked
because
you
wear
a
hat
will
she
what
a
very
funny
woman
but
fitzgerald
i
give
up
my
hat
let
her
say
what
she
will
i
should
rather
think
not
and
townsend
we
know
him
a
little
he
very
good
too
he
do
you
mean
me
to
answer
you
truly
or
to
answer
you
according
to
the
idea
of
never
saying
any
ill
of
one
neighbour
oh
both
if
you
can
oh
both
must
i
well
then
i
think
him
good
as
a
man
but
bad
as
a
clergyman
but
i
thought
he
worked
so
very
hard
as
a
clergyman
so
he
does
but
if
he
works
evil
rather
than
good
you
ca
call
him
a
good
clergyman
mind
you
would
have
my
opinion
and
if
i
talk
treason
and
heterodoxy
and
infidelity
and
papistry
you
must
only
take
it
for
what
it
worth
i
sure
you
wo
talk
infidelity
nor
yet
treason
and
then
moreover
townsend
would
be
so
much
better
a
clergyman
to
my
way
of
thinking
if
he
would
sometimes
brush
his
hair
and
occasionally
put
on
a
clean
surplice
but
remember
not
a
word
of
all
this
to
aunt
letty
oh
dear
no
of
course
not
townsend
did
come
out
of
the
house
on
the
little
sweep
before
the
door
to
help
miss
letty
up
on
the
car
though
it
was
dark
and
piercingly
cold
well
young
ladies
and
wo
you
come
in
now
and
warm
yourselves
they
all
of
course
deprecated
any
such
idea
and
declared
that
they
were
already
much
too
late
richard
mind
you
take
care
going
down
ballydahan
hill
said
the
parson
giving
a
not
unnecessary
caution
to
the
servant
i
came
up
it
just
now
and
it
was
one
sheet
of
ice
now
richard
do
be
careful
said
miss
letty
never
fear
miss
said
richard
we
take
care
of
you
said
herbert
you
not
frightened
lady
clara
are
you
oh
no
said
clara
and
so
they
started
it
was
quite
dark
and
very
cold
and
there
was
a
sharp
hard
frost
but
the
lamps
of
the
car
were
lighted
and
the
horse
seemed
to
be
on
his
mettle
for
he
did
his
work
well
ballydahan
hill
was
not
above
a
mile
from
the
glebe
and
descending
that
richard
by
his
young
master
orders
got
down
from
his
seat
and
went
to
the
head
herbert
also
himself
got
off
and
led
his
horse
down
the
hill
at
first
the
girls
were
a
little
inclined
to
be
frightened
and
miss
letty
found
herself
obliged
to
remind
them
that
they
melt
the
frost
by
screaming
but
they
all
got
safely
down
and
were
soon
chattering
as
fast
as
though
they
were
already
safe
in
the
of
castle
richmond
they
went
on
without
any
accident
till
they
reached
a
turn
in
the
road
about
two
miles
from
home
and
there
all
in
a
moment
quite
suddenly
when
nobody
was
thinking
about
the
frost
or
the
danger
down
came
the
poor
horse
on
his
side
his
feet
having
gone
quite
from
under
him
and
a
dreadful
cracking
sound
of
broken
timber
gave
notice
that
a
shaft
was
smashed
a
shaft
at
least
was
smashed
if
only
no
other
harm
was
done
it
can
hardly
be
that
herbert
fitzgerald
cared
more
for
such
a
stranger
as
lady
clara
desmond
than
he
did
for
his
own
sisters
and
aunt
but
nevertheless
it
was
to
lady
clara
assistance
that
he
first
betook
himself
perhaps
he
had
seen
or
fancied
that
he
saw
that
she
had
fallen
with
the
greatest
violence
speak
speak
said
he
as
he
jumped
from
his
horse
close
to
her
side
are
you
hurt
do
speak
to
me
and
going
down
on
his
knees
on
the
hard
ground
he
essayed
to
lift
her
in
his
arms
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
she
no
i
am
not
hurt
at
least
i
think
not
only
just
my
arm
a
very
little
where
is
emmeline
is
emmeline
hurt
no
said
emmeline
picking
herself
up
but
oh
dear
dear
lost
my
muff
and
i
spoiled
my
hat
where
are
mary
and
aunt
letty
after
some
considerable
confusion
it
was
found
that
nothing
was
much
damaged
except
the
car
one
shaft
of
which
was
broken
altogether
in
two
lady
clara
arm
was
bruised
and
rather
sore
but
the
three
other
ladies
had
altogether
escaped
the
quantity
of
clothes
that
had
been
wrapped
round
them
had
no
doubt
enabled
them
to
fall
softly
and
what
about
the
horse
richard
asked
young
fitzgerald
he
did
come
upon
his
knees
at
all
at
all
master
herbert
said
richard
scrutinizing
the
animal
legs
with
the
car
lamp
in
his
hand
i
do
think
he
a
taste
the
worse
but
the
car
master
herbert
is
clane
smashed
such
being
found
to
be
undoubtedly
the
fact
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
that
the
ladies
should
walk
home
herbert
again
forgot
that
the
age
of
his
aunt
imperatively
demanded
all
the
assistance
that
he
could
lend
her
and
with
many
lamentations
that
fortune
and
the
frost
should
have
used
her
so
cruelly
he
gave
his
arm
to
clara
but
do
think
of
miss
fitzgerald
said
clara
speaking
gently
into
his
ear
who
oh
my
aunt
aunt
letty
never
cares
for
anybody
arm
she
always
prefers
walking
alone
fie
fitzgerald
fie
it
is
impossible
to
believe
such
an
assertion
as
that
and
yet
clara
did
seem
to
believe
it
for
she
took
his
proffered
arm
without
further
objection
it
was
seven
when
they
reached
the
hall
door
and
at
that
time
they
had
all
forgotten
the
misfortune
of
the
car
in
the
fun
of
the
dark
frosty
walk
home
herbert
had
found
a
boy
to
lead
his
horse
and
richard
was
of
course
left
with
the
ruins
in
the
road
and
how
your
arm
now
asked
herbert
tenderly
as
they
entered
in
under
the
porch
oh
it
does
not
hurt
me
hardly
at
all
i
do
mind
it
in
the
least
and
then
the
door
was
opened
for
them
they
all
flocked
into
the
hall
and
there
they
were
met
by
lady
fitzgerald
oh
mamma
said
mary
i
know
you
quite
frightened
out
of
your
life
but
there
nothing
the
matter
the
horse
tumbled
down
but
there
nobody
hurt
and
we
had
to
walk
home
from
the
turn
to
ballyclough
said
emmeline
but
oh
mamma
what
the
matter
they
all
now
looked
up
at
lady
fitzgerald
and
it
was
evident
enough
that
something
was
the
matter
something
to
be
thought
of
infinitely
more
than
that
accident
on
the
road
oh
mary
mary
what
is
it
said
aunt
letty
coming
forward
and
taking
hold
of
her
hand
is
my
brother
ill
sir
thomas
is
not
very
well
and
i
been
waiting
for
you
so
long
where
herbert
i
must
speak
to
herbert
and
then
the
mother
and
son
left
the
hall
together
there
was
then
a
silence
among
the
four
ladies
that
were
left
there
standing
at
first
they
followed
each
other
into
the
all
wrapped
up
as
they
were
and
sat
on
chairs
apart
saying
nothing
to
each
other
at
last
aunt
letty
got
up
you
had
better
go
with
lady
clara
said
she
i
will
go
to
your
mamma
oh
aunt
letty
do
send
us
word
pray
send
us
word
said
emmeline
mary
now
began
to
cry
i
know
he
very
ill
i
sure
he
very
oh
what
shall
we
do
you
had
better
go
up
stairs
with
lady
clara
said
aunt
letty
i
will
send
you
up
word
immediately
oh
do
mind
me
pray
do
mind
me
said
clara
pray
pray
do
take
notice
of
me
and
she
rushed
forward
and
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
before
emmeline
began
to
kiss
her
they
remained
here
heedless
of
aunt
letty
advice
for
some
ten
minutes
and
then
herbert
came
to
them
the
two
girls
flew
at
him
with
questions
while
lady
clara
stood
by
the
window
anxious
to
learn
but
unwilling
to
thrust
herself
into
their
family
matters
my
father
has
been
much
troubled
and
is
not
well
said
herbert
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
to
frighten
us
come
let
us
go
to
dinner
the
going
to
dinner
was
but
a
sorry
farce
with
any
of
them
but
nevertheless
they
went
through
the
ceremony
each
for
the
sake
of
the
others
may
we
see
him
said
the
girls
to
their
mother
who
did
come
down
into
the
for
one
moment
to
speak
to
clara
not
loves
he
should
not
be
disturbed
and
so
that
day
came
to
an
end
not
satisfactorily
chapter
ix
family
councils
when
the
girls
and
aunt
letty
went
to
their
chambers
that
night
herbert
returned
to
his
mother
own
and
there
seated
over
the
fire
with
her
discussed
the
matter
of
his
father
sudden
attack
he
had
been
again
with
his
father
and
sir
thomas
had
seemed
glad
to
have
him
there
but
now
he
had
left
him
for
the
night
he
will
sleep
now
mother
said
the
son
he
has
taken
laudanum
i
fear
he
takes
that
too
often
now
it
was
good
for
him
to
have
it
he
did
not
get
too
much
for
i
dropped
it
for
him
and
then
they
sat
silent
for
a
few
moments
together
mother
said
herbert
who
can
this
man
have
been
i
have
no
knowledge
no
idea
no
guess
even
said
lady
fitzgerald
it
is
that
man
visit
that
has
upset
him
oh
certainly
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
i
was
waiting
for
the
man
to
go
and
went
in
almost
before
he
was
out
of
the
house
well
and
i
found
your
father
quite
prostrated
not
on
the
floor
no
not
exactly
on
the
floor
he
was
still
seated
on
his
chair
but
his
head
was
on
the
table
over
his
arms
i
have
often
found
him
in
that
way
mother
but
you
never
saw
him
looking
as
he
looked
this
morning
herbert
when
i
went
in
he
was
speechless
and
he
remained
so
i
should
say
for
some
minutes
was
he
senseless
no
he
knew
me
well
enough
and
grasped
me
by
the
hand
and
when
i
would
have
gone
to
the
bell
to
ring
for
assistance
he
would
not
let
me
i
thought
he
would
have
gone
into
a
fit
when
i
attempted
it
and
what
did
you
do
i
sat
there
by
him
with
his
hand
in
mine
quite
quietly
and
then
he
uttered
a
long
deep
sigh
and
oh
herbert
well
mother
at
last
he
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
sobbed
and
cried
like
a
child
mother
he
did
so
that
it
was
piteous
to
see
him
but
it
did
him
good
for
he
was
better
after
it
and
all
the
time
he
never
let
go
my
hand
but
held
it
and
kissed
it
and
then
he
took
me
by
the
waist
and
kissed
me
oh
so
often
and
all
the
while
his
tears
were
running
like
the
tears
of
a
girl
and
lady
fitzgerald
as
she
told
the
story
could
not
herself
refrain
from
weeping
and
did
he
say
anything
afterwards
about
this
man
yes
not
at
first
that
is
of
course
i
asked
him
who
he
was
as
soon
as
i
thought
he
could
bear
the
question
but
he
turned
away
and
merely
said
that
he
was
a
stupid
man
about
some
old
london
business
and
that
he
should
have
gone
to
prendergast
but
when
after
a
while
i
pressed
him
he
said
that
the
man
name
was
mollett
and
that
he
had
or
pretended
to
have
some
claim
upon
the
city
property
a
claim
on
the
city
property
why
it
not
seven
hundred
a
year
altogether
if
any
mollett
could
run
away
with
it
all
that
loss
would
not
affect
him
like
that
so
i
said
herbert
not
exactly
in
those
words
but
trying
to
comfort
him
he
then
put
it
off
by
declaring
that
it
was
the
consciousness
of
his
inability
to
see
any
one
on
business
which
affected
him
so
grievously
it
was
that
he
said
to
me
and
there
may
be
something
in
that
herbert
yes
but
then
what
should
make
him
so
weak
to
begin
with
if
you
remember
mother
he
was
very
well
more
like
himself
than
usual
last
night
oh
i
observed
it
he
seemed
to
like
having
clara
desmond
there
did
he
mother
i
observed
that
too
but
then
clara
desmond
is
such
a
sweet
creature
the
mother
looked
at
her
son
as
he
said
this
but
the
son
did
not
notice
the
look
i
do
wonder
what
the
real
truth
can
be
he
continued
do
you
think
there
is
anything
wrong
about
the
property
in
general
about
this
estate
here
no
i
do
think
that
said
the
mother
sadly
what
can
it
be
then
but
lady
fitzgerald
sat
there
and
did
not
answer
the
question
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
mother
i
go
up
to
london
and
see
prendergast
and
consult
him
oh
no
you
must
do
that
i
am
wrong
to
tell
you
all
this
for
he
told
me
to
talk
to
no
one
but
it
would
kill
me
if
i
did
speak
of
it
to
you
all
the
same
mother
i
think
it
would
be
best
to
consult
prendergast
not
yet
herbert
i
dare
say
prendergast
may
be
a
very
good
sort
of
man
but
we
none
of
us
know
him
and
if
as
is
very
probable
this
is
only
an
affair
of
health
it
would
be
wrong
in
you
to
go
to
a
stranger
it
might
look
look
what
mother
people
might
think
he
i
mean
that
you
wanted
to
interfere
but
who
ought
to
interfere
on
his
behalf
if
i
do
quite
true
dearest
i
understand
what
you
mean
and
know
how
good
you
are
but
perhaps
prendergast
might
not
he
might
think
you
wanted
wanted
what
mother
i
do
understand
you
wanted
to
take
the
things
out
of
your
father
hands
oh
mother
he
does
know
you
and
what
is
more
i
do
think
he
knows
much
of
your
father
do
go
to
him
yet
and
herbert
promised
that
he
would
not
and
you
do
think
that
this
man
was
ever
here
before
he
asked
well
i
rather
think
he
was
here
once
before
many
years
ago
soon
after
you
went
to
school
so
long
ago
as
that
yes
not
that
i
remember
him
or
indeed
ever
knew
of
his
coming
then
if
he
did
come
but
jones
says
that
she
thinks
she
remembers
him
did
jones
see
him
now
yes
she
was
in
the
hall
as
he
passed
through
on
his
way
out
and
it
so
happened
that
she
let
him
in
and
out
too
when
he
came
before
that
is
if
it
is
the
same
man
that
very
odd
it
did
not
happen
here
we
were
at
tenby
for
a
few
weeks
in
the
summer
i
remember
you
went
there
with
the
girls
just
when
i
went
back
to
school
jones
was
with
us
and
richard
we
had
none
other
of
our
own
servants
and
jones
says
that
the
same
man
did
come
then
that
he
stayed
with
your
father
for
an
hour
or
two
and
that
when
he
left
your
father
was
depressed
almost
as
he
was
yesterday
i
well
remember
that
i
know
that
a
man
did
come
to
him
at
tenby
and
oh
herbert
what
is
it
mother
speak
out
at
any
rate
to
me
since
that
man
came
to
him
at
tenby
he
has
never
been
like
what
he
was
before
and
then
there
was
more
questioning
between
them
about
jones
and
her
remembrances
it
must
be
explained
that
jones
was
a
very
old
and
very
valued
servant
she
had
originally
been
brought
up
as
a
child
by
wainwright
in
that
dorsetshire
parsonage
and
had
since
remained
firm
to
the
fortunes
of
the
young
lady
whose
maid
she
had
become
on
her
first
marriage
as
her
mistress
had
been
promoted
so
had
jones
at
first
she
had
been
kitty
to
all
the
world
now
she
was
jones
to
the
world
at
large
jones
to
sir
thomas
and
her
mistress
and
of
late
years
to
herbert
and
known
by
all
manner
of
affectionate
sobriquets
to
the
young
ladies
sometimes
they
would
call
her
johnny
and
sometimes
the
duchess
but
doubtless
they
and
jones
thoroughly
understood
each
other
by
the
whole
establishment
jones
was
held
in
great
respect
and
by
the
younger
portion
in
extreme
awe
her
breakfast
and
tea
she
had
in
a
little
by
herself
but
the
solitude
of
this
was
too
tremendous
for
her
to
endure
at
at
that
meal
she
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
in
the
servants
hall
though
she
never
troubled
herself
to
carve
anything
except
puddings
and
pies
for
which
she
had
a
great
partiality
and
of
which
she
was
supposed
to
be
the
most
undoubted
and
severe
judge
known
of
anywhere
in
that
part
of
the
country
she
was
supposed
by
all
her
brother
and
sister
servants
to
be
a
very
croesus
for
wealth
and
wondrous
tales
were
told
of
the
money
she
had
put
by
but
as
she
was
certainly
honest
and
supposed
to
be
very
generous
to
certain
poor
relations
in
dorsetshire
some
of
these
stories
were
probably
mythic
it
was
known
however
as
a
fact
that
two
castle
richmond
butlers
one
steward
three
neighbouring
farmers
and
one
wickedly
ambitious
coachman
had
endeavoured
to
tempt
her
to
matrimony
in
vain
she
did
want
none
of
them
she
told
her
mistress
and
what
was
more
she
would
have
none
of
them
and
therefore
she
remained
jones
with
brevet
rank
it
seemed
from
what
lady
fitzgerald
said
that
jones
manner
had
been
somewhat
mysterious
about
this
man
mollett
she
had
endeavoured
to
reassure
and
comfort
her
mistress
saying
that
nothing
would
come
of
it
as
nothing
had
come
of
that
other
tenby
visit
and
giving
it
as
her
counsel
that
the
ladies
should
allow
the
whole
matter
to
pass
by
without
further
notice
but
at
the
same
time
lady
fitzgerald
had
remarked
that
her
manner
had
been
very
serious
when
she
first
said
that
she
had
seen
the
man
before
jones
lady
fitzgerald
had
said
to
her
very
earnestly
if
you
know
more
about
this
man
than
you
are
telling
me
you
are
bound
to
speak
out
and
let
me
know
everything
who
i
my
lady
what
could
i
know
only
he
do
look
to
me
like
the
same
man
and
so
i
thought
it
right
to
say
to
your
ladyship
lady
fitzgerald
had
seen
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
gained
by
and
so
she
had
allowed
the
matter
to
drop
but
she
was
by
no
means
satisfied
that
this
servant
whom
she
so
trusted
did
not
know
more
than
she
had
told
and
then
jones
had
been
with
her
in
those
dreadful
dorsetshire
days
and
an
undefined
fear
began
to
creep
over
her
very
soul
god
bless
you
my
child
said
lady
fitzgerald
as
her
son
got
up
to
leave
her
and
then
she
embraced
him
with
more
warmth
even
than
was
her
wont
all
that
we
can
do
at
present
is
to
be
gentle
with
him
and
not
to
encourage
people
around
him
to
talk
of
his
illness
on
the
next
morning
lady
fitzgerald
did
not
come
down
to
breakfast
but
sent
her
love
to
clara
and
begged
her
guest
to
excuse
her
on
account
of
headache
sir
thomas
rarely
came
in
to
breakfast
and
therefore
his
absence
was
not
remarkable
his
daughters
however
went
up
to
see
him
as
did
also
his
sister
and
they
all
declared
that
he
was
very
much
better
it
was
some
sudden
attack
i
suppose
said
clara
yes
very
sudden
he
has
had
the
same
before
said
herbert
but
they
do
not
at
all
affect
his
intellect
or
bodily
powers
depression
is
i
suppose
the
name
that
the
doctors
would
call
it
and
then
at
last
it
became
noticeable
by
them
that
lady
clara
did
not
use
her
left
arm
oh
clara
said
emmeline
i
see
now
that
you
are
hurt
how
selfish
we
have
been
oh
dear
oh
dear
and
both
emmeline
and
mary
immediately
surrounded
her
examining
her
arm
and
almost
carrying
her
to
the
sofa
i
do
think
it
will
be
much
said
clara
it
only
a
little
stiff
oh
herbert
what
shall
we
do
do
look
here
the
inside
of
her
arm
is
quite
black
herbert
gently
touching
her
hand
did
examine
the
arm
and
declared
his
opinion
that
she
had
received
a
dreadfully
violent
blow
emmeline
proposed
to
send
for
a
doctor
to
pronounce
whether
or
no
it
were
broken
mary
said
that
she
did
think
it
was
broken
but
that
she
was
sure
the
patient
ought
not
to
be
moved
that
day
or
probably
for
a
week
aunt
letty
in
the
mean
time
prescribed
a
bandage
with
great
authority
and
bounced
out
of
the
room
to
fetch
the
necessary
linen
and
basin
of
water
it
nothing
at
all
continued
clara
and
indeed
i
shall
go
home
indeed
i
shall
it
might
be
very
bad
for
your
arm
that
you
should
be
moved
said
herbert
and
your
staying
here
will
not
be
the
least
trouble
to
us
we
shall
all
be
so
happy
to
have
you
shall
we
not
mary
of
course
we
shall
and
so
will
mamma
i
am
so
sorry
to
be
here
now
said
clara
when
i
know
you
are
all
in
such
trouble
about
sir
thomas
but
as
for
going
i
shall
go
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
make
it
convenient
to
send
me
indeed
i
shall
and
so
the
matter
was
discussed
between
them
aunt
letty
in
the
mean
time
binding
up
the
bruised
arm
with
appliances
lady
clara
was
quite
firm
about
going
and
therefore
at
about
twelve
she
was
sent
i
should
say
taken
for
emmeline
insisted
on
going
with
her
in
the
carriage
herbert
would
have
gone
also
but
he
felt
that
he
ought
not
to
leave
castle
richmond
that
day
on
account
of
his
father
but
he
would
certainly
ride
over
he
said
and
learn
how
her
arm
was
the
next
morning
and
about
clady
you
know
said
clara
i
will
go
on
to
clady
also
i
did
send
a
man
there
yesterday
to
see
about
the
flue
it
the
flue
that
wrong
i
know
oh
thank
you
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
said
clara
and
then
the
carriage
drove
off
and
herbert
returned
into
the
morning
with
his
sister
mary
i
tell
you
what
it
is
master
herbert
said
mary
well
what
is
it
you
are
going
to
fall
in
love
with
her
young
ladyship
am
i
is
that
all
you
know
about
it
and
who
are
you
going
to
fall
in
love
with
pray
oh
his
young
lordship
perhaps
only
he
ought
to
be
about
ten
years
older
so
that
i
afraid
that
would
do
but
clara
is
just
the
age
for
you
it
really
seems
as
though
it
were
all
prepared
ready
to
your
hand
you
girls
always
do
think
that
those
things
are
ready
prepared
and
so
saying
herbert
walked
off
with
great
manly
dignity
to
some
retreat
among
his
own
books
and
papers
there
to
meditate
whether
this
thing
were
in
truth
prepared
for
him
it
certainly
was
the
fact
that
the
house
did
seem
very
blank
to
him
now
that
clara
was
gone
and
that
he
looked
forward
with
impatience
to
the
visit
which
it
was
so
necessary
that
he
should
make
on
the
following
day
to
clady
the
house
at
castle
richmond
was
very
silent
and
quiet
that
day
when
emmeline
came
back
she
and
her
sister
remained
together
nothing
had
been
said
to
them
about
mollett
visit
and
they
had
no
other
idea
than
that
this
lowness
of
spirits
on
their
father
part
to
which
they
had
gradually
become
accustomed
had
become
worse
and
more
dangerous
to
his
health
than
ever
aunt
letty
talked
much
about
it
to
herbert
to
lady
fitzgerald
to
jones
and
to
her
brother
and
was
quite
certain
that
she
had
penetrated
to
the
depth
of
the
whole
matter
that
nasty
city
property
she
said
which
had
come
with
her
grandmother
had
always
given
the
family
more
trouble
than
it
was
worth
indeed
her
grandmother
had
been
a
very
troublesome
woman
altogether
and
no
wonder
for
though
she
was
a
protestant
herself
she
had
had
papist
relations
in
lancashire
she
distinctly
remembered
to
have
heard
that
there
was
some
flaw
in
the
title
of
that
property
and
she
knew
that
it
was
very
hard
to
get
some
of
the
tenants
to
pay
any
rent
that
she
had
always
heard
she
was
quite
sure
that
this
man
was
some
person
laying
a
claim
to
it
and
threatening
to
prosecute
his
claim
at
law
it
was
a
thousand
pities
that
her
brother
should
allow
such
a
trifle
as
this
for
after
all
it
was
but
a
trifle
to
fret
his
spirits
and
worry
him
in
this
way
but
it
was
the
wretched
state
of
his
health
were
he
once
himself
again
all
such
annoyances
as
that
would
pass
him
by
like
the
wind
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
aunt
letty
memory
in
this
respect
was
not
exactly
correct
for
as
it
happened
sir
thomas
held
his
little
property
in
the
city
of
london
by
as
firm
a
tenure
as
the
laws
and
customs
of
his
country
could
give
him
and
seeing
that
his
income
thence
arising
came
from
ground
rents
near
the
river
on
which
property
stood
worth
some
hundreds
of
thousands
it
was
not
very
probable
that
his
tenants
should
be
in
arrear
but
what
she
said
had
some
effect
upon
herbert
he
was
not
quite
sure
whether
this
might
not
be
the
cause
of
his
father
grief
and
if
the
story
did
not
have
much
effect
upon
lady
fitzgerald
at
any
rate
it
did
as
well
as
any
other
to
exercise
the
ingenuity
and
affection
of
aunt
letty
sir
thomas
passed
the
whole
of
that
day
in
his
own
room
but
during
a
great
portion
of
the
day
either
his
wife
or
sister
or
son
was
with
him
they
endeavoured
not
to
leave
him
alone
with
his
own
thoughts
feeling
conscious
that
something
preyed
upon
his
mind
though
ignorant
as
to
what
that
something
might
be
he
was
quite
aware
of
the
nature
of
their
thoughts
perfectly
conscious
of
the
judgment
they
had
formed
respecting
him
he
knew
that
he
was
subjecting
himself
in
the
eyes
not
only
of
his
own
family
but
of
all
those
around
him
to
suspicions
which
must
be
injurious
to
him
and
yet
he
could
not
shake
off
the
feeling
that
depressed
him
but
at
last
he
did
resolve
to
make
an
attempt
at
doing
so
for
some
time
in
the
evening
he
was
altogether
alone
and
he
then
strove
to
force
his
mind
to
work
upon
the
matter
which
occupied
it
to
arrange
his
ideas
and
bring
himself
into
a
state
in
which
he
could
make
a
resolution
for
hours
he
had
sat
not
thinking
upon
this
subject
for
thought
is
an
exertion
which
requires
a
combination
of
ideas
and
results
in
the
deducing
of
conclusions
from
premises
and
no
such
effort
as
that
had
he
hitherto
made
but
endeavouring
to
think
while
he
allowed
the
matter
of
his
grief
to
lie
ever
before
his
mind
eye
he
had
said
to
himself
over
and
over
again
that
it
behoved
him
to
make
some
great
effort
to
shake
off
this
incubus
that
depressed
him
but
yet
no
such
effort
had
hitherto
been
even
attempted
now
at
last
he
arose
and
shook
himself
and
promised
to
himself
that
he
would
be
a
man
it
might
be
that
the
misfortune
under
which
he
groaned
was
heavy
but
let
one
sorrow
be
what
it
may
there
is
always
a
better
and
a
worse
way
of
meeting
it
let
what
trouble
may
fall
on
a
shoulders
a
man
may
always
bear
it
manfully
and
are
not
troubles
when
so
borne
half
cured
it
is
the
flinching
from
pain
which
makes
pain
so
painful
this
truth
came
home
to
him
as
he
sat
there
that
day
thinking
what
he
should
do
endeavouring
to
think
in
what
way
he
might
best
turn
himself
but
there
was
this
that
was
especially
grievous
to
him
that
he
had
no
friend
whom
he
might
consult
in
this
matter
it
was
a
sorrow
the
cause
of
which
he
could
not
explain
to
his
own
family
and
in
all
other
troubles
he
had
sought
assistance
and
looked
for
counsel
there
and
there
only
he
had
had
one
best
steadiest
dearest
truest
counsellor
and
now
it
had
come
to
pass
that
things
were
so
placed
that
in
this
great
trouble
he
could
not
go
to
her
and
now
a
friend
was
so
necessary
to
him
he
felt
that
he
was
not
fit
to
judge
how
he
himself
should
act
in
this
terrible
emergency
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
that
he
should
allow
himself
to
be
guided
by
some
one
else
but
to
whom
should
he
appeal
he
is
a
cold
man
said
he
to
himself
as
one
name
did
occur
to
him
very
cold
almost
unfeeling
but
he
is
honest
and
just
and
then
again
he
sat
and
thought
yes
he
is
honest
and
just
and
what
should
i
want
better
than
honesty
and
justice
and
then
shuddering
as
he
resolved
he
did
resolve
that
he
would
send
for
this
honest
and
just
man
he
would
send
for
him
or
perhaps
better
still
go
to
him
at
any
rate
he
would
tell
him
the
whole
truth
of
his
grief
and
then
act
as
the
cold
just
man
should
bid
him
but
he
need
not
do
this
yet
not
quite
yet
so
at
least
he
said
to
himself
falsely
if
a
man
decide
with
a
fixed
decision
that
his
tooth
should
come
out
or
his
leg
be
cut
off
let
the
tooth
come
out
or
the
leg
be
cut
off
on
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
it
is
the
flinching
from
such
pain
that
is
so
grievously
painful
but
it
was
something
to
have
brought
his
mind
to
bear
with
a
fixed
purpose
upon
these
things
and
to
have
resolved
upon
what
he
would
do
though
he
still
lacked
strength
to
put
his
resolution
immediately
to
the
proof
then
later
in
the
evening
his
son
came
and
sat
with
him
and
he
was
able
in
some
sort
to
declare
that
the
worst
of
that
evil
day
had
passed
from
him
i
shall
breakfast
with
you
all
he
said
and
as
he
spoke
a
faint
smile
passed
across
his
face
oh
i
hope
you
will
said
herbert
we
shall
be
so
delighted
but
father
do
not
exert
yourself
too
soon
it
will
do
me
good
i
think
i
am
sure
it
will
if
the
fatigue
be
not
too
much
the
truth
is
herbert
i
have
allowed
this
feeling
to
grow
upon
me
till
i
have
become
weak
under
it
i
know
that
i
ought
to
make
an
exertion
to
throw
it
off
and
it
is
possible
that
i
may
succeed
herbert
muttered
some
few
hopeful
words
but
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
know
what
he
ought
to
say
that
his
father
had
some
secret
he
was
quite
sure
and
it
is
hard
to
talk
to
a
man
about
his
secret
without
knowing
what
that
secret
is
i
have
allowed
myself
to
fall
into
a
weak
state
continued
sir
thomas
speaking
slowly
while
by
proper
exertion
i
might
have
avoided
it
you
have
been
very
ill
father
said
herbert
yes
i
have
been
ill
very
ill
certainly
but
i
do
not
know
that
any
doctor
could
have
helped
me
father
no
herbert
do
not
ask
me
questions
do
not
inquire
at
any
rate
not
at
present
i
will
endeavour
now
at
least
i
will
endeavour
to
do
my
duty
but
do
not
urge
me
by
questions
or
appear
to
notice
me
if
i
am
infirm
but
father
if
we
could
comfort
you
ah
if
you
could
but
never
mind
i
will
endeavour
to
shake
off
this
depression
and
herbert
comfort
your
mother
do
not
let
her
think
much
of
all
this
if
it
can
be
helped
but
how
can
it
be
helped
and
tell
her
this
there
is
a
matter
that
troubles
my
mind
is
it
about
the
property
father
no
yes
it
certainly
is
about
the
property
in
one
sense
then
do
not
heed
it
we
shall
none
of
us
heed
it
who
has
so
good
a
right
to
say
so
as
i
bless
you
my
darling
boy
but
herbert
such
things
must
be
heeded
more
or
less
you
know
but
you
may
tell
your
mother
this
and
perhaps
it
may
comfort
her
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
london
and
to
see
prendergast
i
will
explain
the
whole
of
this
thing
to
him
and
as
he
bids
me
so
will
i
act
this
was
thought
to
be
satisfactory
to
a
certain
extent
both
by
the
mother
and
son
they
would
have
been
better
pleased
had
he
opened
his
heart
to
them
and
told
them
everything
but
that
it
was
clear
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
this
prendergast
they
had
heard
was
a
good
man
and
in
his
present
state
it
was
better
that
he
should
seek
counsel
of
any
man
than
allow
his
sorrow
to
feed
upon
himself
alone
chapter
x
the
rector
of
drumbarrow
and
his
wife
herbert
fitzgerald
in
speaking
of
the
rev
√¶neas
townsend
to
lady
clara
desmond
had
said
that
in
his
opinion
the
reverend
gentleman
was
a
good
man
but
a
bad
clergyman
but
there
were
not
a
few
in
the
county
cork
who
would
have
said
just
the
reverse
and
declared
him
to
be
a
bad
man
but
a
good
clergyman
there
were
others
indeed
who
knew
him
well
who
would
have
declared
him
to
be
perfect
in
both
respects
and
others
again
who
thought
him
in
both
respects
to
be
very
bad
amidst
these
great
diversities
of
opinion
i
will
venture
on
none
of
my
own
but
will
attempt
to
describe
him
in
ireland
stanch
protestantism
consists
too
much
in
a
hatred
of
papistry
in
that
rather
than
in
a
hatred
of
those
errors
against
which
we
protestants
are
supposed
to
protest
hence
the
cross
which
should
i
presume
be
the
emblem
of
salvation
to
us
all
creates
a
feeling
of
dismay
and
often
of
disgust
instead
of
love
and
reverence
and
the
very
name
of
a
saint
savours
in
irish
protestant
ears
of
idolatry
although
irish
protestants
on
every
sunday
profess
to
believe
in
a
communion
of
such
these
are
the
feelings
rather
than
the
opinions
of
the
most
protestant
of
irish
protestants
and
it
is
intelligible
that
they
should
have
been
produced
by
the
close
vicinity
of
roman
catholic
worship
in
the
minds
of
men
who
are
energetic
and
excitable
but
not
always
discreet
or
argumentative
one
of
such
was
townsend
and
few
men
carried
their
protestant
fervour
further
than
he
did
a
cross
was
to
him
what
a
red
cloth
is
supposed
to
be
to
a
bull
and
so
averse
was
he
to
the
intercession
of
saints
that
he
always
regarded
as
a
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
a
certain
english
clergyman
who
had
written
to
him
a
letter
dated
from
the
feast
of
michael
and
all
angels
on
this
account
herbert
fitzgerald
took
upon
himself
to
say
that
he
regarded
him
as
a
bad
clergyman
whereas
most
of
his
protestant
neighbours
looked
upon
this
enthusiasm
as
his
chief
excellence
and
this
admiration
for
him
induced
his
friends
to
overlook
what
they
must
have
acknowledged
to
be
defects
in
his
character
though
he
had
a
good
living
at
least
what
the
laity
in
speaking
of
clerical
incomes
is
generally
inclined
to
call
a
good
living
we
will
say
amounting
in
value
to
four
hundred
pounds
a
year
he
was
always
in
debt
this
was
the
more
inexcusable
as
he
had
no
children
and
had
some
small
private
means
and
nobody
knew
why
he
was
in
debt
in
which
word
nobody
he
himself
must
certainly
be
included
he
had
no
personal
expenses
of
his
own
his
wife
though
she
was
a
very
queer
woman
as
lady
clara
had
said
could
hardly
be
called
an
extravagant
woman
there
was
nothing
large
or
splendid
about
the
way
of
living
at
the
glebe
anybody
who
came
there
both
he
and
she
were
willing
to
feed
as
long
as
they
chose
to
stay
and
a
good
many
in
this
way
they
did
feed
but
they
never
invited
guests
and
as
for
giving
regular
fixed
as
parish
rectors
do
in
england
no
such
idea
ever
crossed
the
brain
of
either
or
townsend
that
they
were
both
charitable
all
the
world
admitted
and
their
admirers
professed
that
hence
arose
all
their
difficulties
but
their
charities
were
of
a
most
indiscreet
kind
money
they
rarely
had
to
give
and
therefore
they
would
give
promises
to
pay
while
their
credit
with
the
butcher
and
baker
was
good
they
would
give
meat
and
bread
and
both
these
functionaries
had
by
this
time
learned
that
though
townsend
might
not
be
able
to
pay
such
bills
himself
his
friends
would
do
so
sooner
or
later
if
duly
pressed
and
therefore
the
larder
at
drumbarrow
glebe
that
was
the
name
of
the
parish
was
never
long
empty
and
then
again
it
was
never
long
full
but
neither
nor
townsend
were
content
to
bestow
their
charities
without
some
other
object
than
that
of
relieving
material
wants
by
their
alms
many
infidels
townsend
argued
had
been
made
believers
by
the
miracle
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
and
therefore
it
was
permissible
for
him
to
make
use
of
the
same
means
for
drawing
over
proselytes
to
the
true
church
if
he
could
find
hungry
papists
and
convert
them
into
protestants
by
one
and
the
same
process
he
must
be
doing
a
double
good
he
argued
could
by
no
possibility
be
doing
an
evil
such
being
the
character
of
townsend
it
will
not
be
thought
surprising
that
he
should
have
his
warm
admirers
and
his
hot
detractors
and
they
who
were
inclined
to
be
among
the
latter
were
not
slow
to
add
up
certain
little
disagreeable
eccentricities
among
the
list
of
his
faults
as
young
fitzgerald
had
done
in
the
matter
of
the
dirty
surplices
townsend
most
uncompromising
foe
for
many
years
had
been
the
rev
bernard
the
parish
priest
for
the
same
parish
of
drumbarrow
father
bernard
as
he
was
called
by
his
own
flock
or
father
barney
as
the
protestants
in
derision
were
delighted
to
name
him
was
much
more
a
man
of
the
world
than
his
protestant
colleague
he
did
not
do
half
so
many
absurd
things
as
did
townsend
and
professed
to
laugh
at
what
he
called
the
protestant
madness
of
the
rector
but
he
also
had
been
an
eager
i
may
also
say
a
malicious
antagonist
what
he
called
the
souping
system
of
the
protestant
clergyman
stank
in
his
nostrils
that
system
by
which
as
he
stated
the
most
ignorant
of
men
were
to
be
induced
to
leave
their
faith
by
the
hope
of
soup
or
other
food
he
was
as
firmly
convinced
of
the
inward
iniquity
of
the
parson
as
the
parson
was
of
that
of
the
priest
and
so
these
two
men
had
learned
to
hate
each
other
and
yet
neither
of
them
were
bad
men
i
do
not
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
this
sort
of
feeling
always
prevailed
in
irish
parishes
between
the
priest
and
the
parson
even
before
the
days
of
the
famine
i
myself
have
met
a
priest
at
a
parson
table
and
have
known
more
than
one
parish
in
which
the
protestant
and
roman
catholic
clergymen
lived
together
on
amicable
terms
but
such
a
feeling
as
that
above
represented
was
common
and
was
by
no
means
held
as
proof
that
the
parties
themselves
were
quarrelsome
or
malicious
it
was
a
part
of
their
religious
convictions
and
who
dares
to
interfere
with
the
religious
convictions
of
a
clergyman
on
the
day
but
one
after
that
on
which
the
castle
richmond
ladies
had
been
thrown
from
their
car
on
the
frosty
road
townsend
and
father
bernard
were
brought
together
in
an
amicable
way
or
in
a
way
that
was
intended
to
be
amicable
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
the
relief
committee
for
the
district
in
which
they
both
lived
was
one
and
the
same
and
it
was
of
course
well
that
both
should
act
on
it
when
the
matter
was
first
arranged
father
bernard
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
went
there
but
townsend
hearing
this
did
not
do
so
but
now
that
it
had
become
evident
that
much
work
and
for
a
long
time
would
have
to
be
performed
at
these
committees
it
was
clear
that
townsend
as
a
protestant
clergyman
could
not
remain
away
without
neglecting
his
duty
and
so
after
many
mental
struggles
and
questions
of
conscience
the
parson
agreed
to
meet
the
priest
the
point
had
been
very
deeply
discussed
between
the
rector
and
his
wife
she
had
given
it
as
her
opinion
that
priest
was
pitch
pitch
itself
in
its
blackest
turpitude
and
as
such
could
not
be
touched
without
defilement
had
not
all
the
protestant
clergymen
of
ireland
in
a
body
or
at
any
rate
all
those
who
were
worth
anything
who
could
with
truth
be
called
protestant
clergymen
had
they
not
all
refused
to
enter
the
doors
of
the
national
schools
because
they
could
not
do
so
without
sharing
their
ministration
there
with
papist
priests
with
priests
of
the
altar
of
baal
as
townsend
called
them
and
should
they
now
yield
when
after
all
the
assistance
needed
was
only
for
the
body
not
for
the
soul
it
may
be
seen
from
this
that
the
lady
mind
was
not
in
its
nature
logical
but
the
extreme
absurdity
of
her
arguments
though
they
did
not
ultimately
have
the
desired
effect
by
no
means
came
home
to
the
understanding
of
her
husband
he
thought
that
there
was
a
great
deal
in
what
she
said
and
almost
felt
that
he
was
yielding
to
instigations
from
the
evil
one
but
public
opinion
was
too
strong
for
him
public
opinion
and
the
innate
kindness
of
his
own
heart
he
felt
that
at
this
very
moment
he
ought
to
labour
specially
for
the
bodies
of
these
poor
people
as
at
other
times
he
would
labour
specially
for
their
souls
and
so
he
yielded
well
said
his
wife
to
him
as
he
got
off
his
car
at
his
own
door
after
the
meeting
what
have
you
done
one
might
have
imagined
from
her
tone
of
voice
and
her
manner
that
she
expected
or
at
least
hoped
to
hear
that
the
priest
had
been
absolutely
exterminated
and
made
away
with
in
the
good
fight
townsend
made
no
immediate
answer
but
proceeded
to
divest
himself
of
his
rusty
outside
coat
and
to
rub
up
his
stiff
grizzled
bristly
uncombed
hair
with
both
his
hands
as
was
his
wont
when
he
was
not
quite
satisfied
with
the
state
of
things
i
suppose
he
was
there
said
townsend
oh
yes
he
was
there
he
is
never
away
i
take
it
when
there
is
any
talking
to
be
done
now
townsend
dearly
loved
to
hear
himself
talk
but
no
man
was
louder
against
the
sins
of
other
orators
and
then
he
began
to
ask
how
many
minutes
it
wanted
to
townsend
knew
his
ways
she
would
not
have
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
getting
from
him
a
true
and
substantial
account
of
what
had
really
passed
if
she
persevered
in
direct
questions
to
the
effect
so
she
pretended
to
drop
the
matter
and
went
and
fetched
her
slippers
the
putting
on
of
which
constituted
his
evening
toilet
and
then
after
some
little
hurrying
inquiry
in
the
kitchen
promised
him
his
dinner
in
fifteen
minutes
was
herbert
fitzgerald
there
oh
yes
he
is
always
there
he
a
nice
young
fellow
a
very
fine
young
fellow
but
but
what
he
thinks
he
understands
the
irish
roman
catholics
but
he
understands
them
no
more
than
than
than
this
slipper
he
said
having
in
vain
cudgelled
his
brain
for
a
better
comparison
you
know
what
aunt
letty
says
about
him
she
doubts
he
is
quite
right
you
know
townsend
by
this
did
not
mean
to
insinuate
that
herbert
was
at
all
afflicted
in
that
way
which
we
attempt
to
designate
when
we
say
that
one
of
our
friends
is
not
all
right
and
at
the
same
time
touch
our
heads
with
our
forefinger
she
had
intended
to
convey
an
impression
that
the
young
man
religious
ideas
were
not
exactly
of
that
stanch
description
which
she
admired
well
he
has
just
come
from
oxford
you
know
said
townsend
and
at
the
present
moment
oxford
is
the
most
dangerous
place
to
which
a
young
man
can
be
sent
and
sir
thomas
would
send
him
there
though
i
remember
telling
his
aunt
over
and
over
again
how
it
would
be
and
townsend
as
she
spoke
shook
her
head
sorrowfully
i
do
mean
to
say
you
know
that
he
absolutely
bitten
oh
i
know
i
understand
when
they
come
to
crosses
and
candlesticks
the
next
step
to
the
glory
of
mary
is
a
very
easy
one
i
would
sooner
send
a
young
man
to
rome
than
to
oxford
at
the
one
he
might
be
shocked
and
disgusted
but
at
the
other
he
is
cajoled
and
cheated
and
ruined
and
then
townsend
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
threw
her
eyes
up
towards
the
ceiling
but
there
was
no
hypocrisy
or
pretence
in
this
expression
of
her
feelings
she
did
in
her
heart
of
hearts
believe
that
there
was
some
college
or
club
of
papists
at
oxford
emissaries
of
the
pope
or
of
the
jesuits
in
her
moments
of
sterner
thought
the
latter
were
the
enemies
she
most
feared
whereas
when
she
was
simply
pervaded
by
her
usual
chronic
hatred
of
the
irish
roman
catholic
hierarchy
she
was
wont
to
inveigh
most
against
the
pope
and
this
college
she
maintained
was
fearfully
successful
in
drawing
away
the
souls
of
young
english
students
indeed
at
oxford
a
man
had
no
chance
against
the
devil
things
were
better
at
cambridge
though
even
there
there
was
great
danger
look
at
a
and
z
and
she
would
name
two
perverts
to
the
church
of
rome
of
whom
she
had
learned
that
they
were
cambridge
men
but
thank
god
trinity
college
still
stood
firm
her
idea
was
that
if
there
were
left
any
real
protestant
truth
in
the
church
of
england
that
church
should
look
to
feed
her
lambs
by
the
hands
of
shepherds
chosen
from
that
seminary
and
from
that
seminary
only
but
is
dinner
nearly
ready
said
townsend
whose
ideas
were
not
so
exclusively
protestant
as
were
those
of
his
wife
i
had
a
morsel
since
breakfast
and
then
his
wife
who
was
peculiarly
anxious
to
keep
him
in
a
good
humour
that
all
might
come
out
about
father
barney
made
another
little
visit
to
the
kitchen
at
last
the
dinner
was
served
the
weather
was
very
cold
and
the
rector
and
his
wife
considered
it
more
cosy
to
use
only
the
parlour
and
not
to
migrate
into
the
cold
air
of
a
second
room
indeed
during
the
winter
months
the
of
drumbarrow
glebe
was
only
used
for
visitors
and
for
visitors
who
were
not
intimate
enough
in
the
house
to
be
placed
upon
the
worn
chairs
and
threadbare
carpet
of
the
and
very
cold
was
that
found
to
be
by
each
visitor
but
the
parlour
was
warm
enough
warm
and
cosy
though
perhaps
at
times
a
little
close
and
of
evenings
there
would
pervade
it
a
smell
of
whisky
punch
not
altogether
acceptable
to
unaccustomed
nostrils
not
that
the
rector
of
drumbarrow
was
by
any
means
an
intemperate
man
his
single
tumbler
of
whisky
toddy
repeated
only
on
sundays
and
some
other
rare
occasions
would
by
no
means
equal
in
point
of
drinking
the
ordinary
port
of
an
ordinary
english
clergyman
but
whisky
punch
does
leave
behind
a
savour
of
its
intrinsic
virtues
delightful
no
doubt
to
those
who
have
imbibed
its
grosser
elements
but
not
equally
acceptable
to
others
who
may
have
been
less
fortunate
during
dinner
there
was
no
conversation
about
herbert
fitzgerald
or
the
committee
or
father
barney
the
old
gardener
who
waited
at
table
with
all
his
garden
clothes
on
him
and
whom
the
neighbours
with
respectful
deference
called
townsend
butler
was
a
roman
catholic
as
indeed
were
all
the
servants
at
the
glebe
and
as
are
necessarily
all
the
native
servants
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
though
and
townsend
put
great
trust
in
their
servant
jerry
as
to
the
ordinary
duties
of
gardening
driving
and
butlering
they
would
not
knowingly
trust
him
with
a
word
of
their
habitual
conversation
about
the
things
around
them
their
idea
was
that
every
word
so
heard
was
carried
to
the
priest
and
that
the
priest
kept
a
book
in
which
every
word
so
uttered
was
written
down
if
this
were
so
through
the
parish
the
priest
must
in
truth
have
had
something
to
do
both
for
himself
and
his
private
secretary
for
in
spite
of
all
precautions
that
were
taken
jerry
and
jerry
brethren
no
doubt
did
hear
much
of
what
was
said
the
repetitions
to
the
priest
however
i
must
take
leave
to
doubt
but
after
dinner
when
the
hot
water
and
whisky
were
on
the
table
when
the
two
old
were
drawn
cozily
up
on
the
rug
each
with
an
old
footstool
before
it
when
the
faithful
wife
had
mixed
that
glass
of
punch
or
jug
rather
for
after
the
old
fashion
it
was
brewed
in
such
a
receptacle
and
when
to
inspire
increased
confidence
she
had
put
into
it
a
small
extra
modicum
of
the
eloquent
spirit
then
the
mouth
of
the
rector
was
opened
and
townsend
was
made
happy
and
so
father
barney
and
i
have
met
at
last
said
he
rather
cheerily
as
the
hot
fumes
of
the
toddy
regaled
his
nostrils
and
how
did
he
behave
now
well
he
was
decent
enough
that
is
as
far
as
absolute
behaviour
went
you
ca
have
a
silk
purse
from
off
a
sow
ear
you
know
no
indeed
and
goodness
knows
there
plenty
of
the
sow
ear
about
him
but
now
√¶neas
dear
do
tell
me
how
it
all
was
just
from
the
beginning
he
was
there
before
me
said
the
husband
catch
a
weasel
asleep
said
the
wife
i
did
catch
him
asleep
at
any
rate
continued
he
he
was
there
before
me
but
when
i
went
into
the
little
room
where
they
hold
the
meeting
it
at
berryhill
is
it
yes
at
the
widow
casey
to
see
that
woman
bowing
and
scraping
and
curtsying
to
father
barney
and
she
his
own
mother
daughter
was
the
best
thing
in
the
world
that
was
just
to
do
him
honour
before
the
quality
you
know
exactly
when
i
went
in
there
was
nobody
there
but
his
reverence
and
master
herbert
as
thick
as
possible
i
suppose
dear
dear
is
it
dreadful
did
i
put
sugar
enough
in
it
√¶neas
well
i
do
know
perhaps
you
may
give
me
another
small
lump
at
any
rate
you
did
forget
the
whisky
i
sure
it
is
a
taste
too
strong
and
after
such
work
as
had
and
so
young
fitzgerald
and
father
barney
yes
there
they
were
with
their
heads
together
it
was
something
about
a
mill
they
were
saying
oh
it
perfectly
dreadful
but
herbert
stopped
and
introduced
me
at
once
to
father
barney
what
a
regular
introduction
i
like
that
indeed
he
did
do
it
altogether
badly
he
said
something
about
being
glad
to
see
two
gentlemen
together
a
gentleman
indeed
who
were
both
so
anxious
to
do
the
best
they
could
in
the
parish
and
whose
influence
was
so
great
or
something
to
that
effect
and
then
we
shook
hands
you
did
shake
hands
oh
yes
if
i
went
there
at
all
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
do
that
i
am
very
glad
it
was
not
me
that
all
i
do
think
i
could
shake
hands
with
father
barney
there
no
knowing
what
you
can
do
my
dear
till
you
try
h
m
said
townsend
meaning
to
signify
thereby
that
she
was
still
strong
in
the
strength
of
her
own
impossibilities
and
then
there
was
a
little
general
conversation
about
the
potato
for
no
one
came
in
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
the
priest
said
that
they
were
as
badly
off
in
limerick
and
clare
as
we
are
here
now
i
do
believe
that
and
when
i
asked
him
how
he
knew
he
quoted
the
the
indeed
just
like
him
i
wonder
it
was
the
in
townsend
estimation
the
parish
priest
was
much
to
blame
because
he
did
not
draw
his
public
information
from
some
newspaper
specially
addicted
to
the
support
of
the
protestant
cause
and
then
somers
came
in
and
he
took
the
chair
i
was
very
much
afraid
at
one
time
that
father
barney
was
going
to
seat
himself
there
you
could
possibly
have
stood
that
i
had
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
i
should
have
walked
about
the
room
and
looked
on
the
whole
affair
as
altogether
irregular
as
though
there
was
no
chairman
but
somers
was
of
course
the
proper
man
and
who
else
came
there
was
from
boherbue
he
was
another
papist
oh
yes
there
was
a
majority
of
them
there
was
greilly
the
man
who
has
got
that
large
take
of
land
over
beyond
banteer
and
then
father
barney
coadjutor
came
in
what
that
man
from
gortnaclough
yes
he
the
curate
of
the
parish
you
know
and
did
you
shake
hands
with
him
too
indeed
i
did
and
you
never
saw
a
fellow
look
so
ashamed
of
himself
in
your
life
well
there
is
much
shame
about
them
generally
and
there
was
much
about
him
you
never
heard
a
man
talk
such
trash
in
your
life
till
somers
put
him
down
oh
he
was
put
down
i
glad
of
that
and
to
do
father
barney
justice
he
did
tell
him
to
hold
his
tongue
the
fool
began
to
make
a
regular
set
speech
father
barney
i
suppose
did
choose
that
anybody
should
do
that
but
himself
he
did
enough
for
the
two
certainly
i
never
heard
a
man
so
fond
of
his
own
voice
what
he
wants
is
to
rule
it
all
just
his
own
way
of
course
he
does
and
that
just
what
you
wo
let
him
do
what
other
reason
can
there
be
for
your
going
there
and
so
the
matter
was
discussed
what
absolute
steps
were
taken
by
the
committee
how
they
agreed
to
buy
so
much
meal
of
such
a
merchant
at
such
a
price
and
with
such
funds
how
it
was
to
be
resold
and
never
given
away
on
any
pretext
how
somers
had
explained
that
giving
away
their
means
was
killing
the
goose
that
laid
the
golden
eggs
when
the
young
priest
in
an
attitude
for
oratory
declared
that
the
poor
had
no
money
with
which
to
make
the
purchase
and
how
in
a
few
weeks
time
they
would
be
able
to
grind
their
own
flour
at
herbert
fitzgerald
mill
all
this
was
also
told
but
the
telling
did
not
give
so
much
gratification
to
townsend
as
the
sly
hits
against
the
two
priests
and
then
while
they
were
still
in
the
middle
of
all
this
when
the
had
given
way
to
the
teapot
and
the
rector
was
beginning
to
bethink
himself
that
a
nap
in
his
would
be
very
refreshing
jerry
came
into
the
room
to
announce
that
richard
had
come
over
from
castle
richmond
with
a
note
for
his
riverence
and
so
richard
was
shown
in
now
richard
might
very
well
have
sent
in
his
note
by
jerry
which
after
all
contained
only
some
information
with
reference
to
a
list
of
old
women
which
herbert
fitzgerald
had
promised
to
send
over
to
the
glebe
but
richard
knew
that
the
minister
would
wish
to
chat
with
him
and
richard
himself
had
no
indisposition
for
a
little
conversation
i
hope
yer
riverences
is
quite
well
then
said
richard
as
he
tendered
his
note
making
a
double
bow
so
as
to
include
them
both
pretty
well
thank
you
said
townsend
and
how
all
the
family
well
then
they
all
rightly
considhering
the
masther
no
just
what
he
war
you
know
i
afraid
not
i
afraid
not
said
the
rector
you
not
take
a
glass
of
spirits
richard
yer
riverence
knows
i
never
does
that
said
richard
with
somewhat
of
a
conscious
look
of
high
morality
for
he
was
a
rigid
teetotaller
and
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
stick
to
that
always
said
townsend
who
firmly
believed
that
no
good
could
come
out
of
nazareth
and
that
even
abstinence
from
whisky
must
be
bad
if
accompanied
by
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
roman
catholic
ceremony
i
do
mean
to
say
that
i
never
touched
a
dhrop
of
anything
sthronger
than
wather
barring
tay
since
the
time
i
got
the
pledge
from
the
blessed
apostle
and
richard
boldly
crossed
himself
in
the
presence
of
them
both
they
knew
well
whom
he
meant
by
the
blessed
apostle
it
was
father
mathew
temperance
is
a
very
good
thing
however
we
may
come
by
it
said
townsend
who
meant
to
imply
by
this
that
richard
temperance
had
been
come
by
in
the
worst
way
possible
that
thrue
for
you
sir
said
richard
but
i
never
knew
any
pledge
kept
only
the
blessed
apostle
by
which
he
meant
to
imply
that
no
sanctity
inherent
in
townsend
sacerdotal
proceedings
could
be
of
any
such
efficacy
and
then
townsend
read
the
note
ah
yes
said
he
tell
herbert
that
i
very
much
obliged
to
him
there
will
be
no
other
answer
necessary
very
well
yer
riverence
i
be
sure
to
give
herbert
the
message
and
richard
made
a
sign
as
though
he
were
going
but
tell
me
richard
said
townsend
is
sir
thomas
any
better
for
we
have
been
really
very
uneasy
about
him
indeed
and
he
is
a
dail
betther
this
morning
the
lord
be
praised
it
was
a
kind
of
a
fit
was
it
richard
asked
the
parson
a
sort
of
a
fit
of
illness
of
some
kind
i
thinking
said
richard
who
had
no
mind
to
speak
of
his
family
secrets
out
of
doors
whatever
he
might
be
called
upon
to
tell
the
priest
at
any
rate
he
was
not
called
on
to
tell
anything
to
the
parson
but
it
was
very
sudden
this
time
was
it
richard
asked
the
lady
immediately
after
that
strange
man
was
shown
into
his
room
eh
i
sure
i
ca
say
but
i
do
think
he
was
a
worse
than
ordinar
till
after
the
gentleman
went
away
i
did
hear
that
he
did
his
business
with
the
gentleman
just
as
usual
like
and
then
he
fell
into
a
fit
did
he
richard
not
that
i
heard
of
he
did
a
dail
of
talking
about
some
law
business
i
did
hear
our
jones
say
and
then
afther
he
just
the
betther
of
it
was
that
all
and
i
do
think
he
none
the
worse
for
it
neither
for
the
masther
do
seem
to
have
more
life
in
him
this
day
than
seen
this
many
a
month
why
he
been
out
and
about
with
her
ladyship
in
the
all
the
morning
has
he
now
well
i
delighted
to
hear
that
it
is
some
trouble
about
the
english
estates
i
believe
that
vexes
him
faix
then
i
do
just
know
what
it
is
that
ails
him
unless
it
be
just
that
he
has
too
much
money
for
to
know
what
to
do
wid
it
that
be
the
sore
vexation
to
me
i
know
well
ah
yes
i
suppose
i
shall
see
jones
or
at
latest
the
day
after
said
townsend
resolving
to
pique
the
man
by
making
him
understand
that
she
could
easily
learn
all
that
she
wished
to
learn
from
the
woman
a
great
comfort
jones
must
be
to
her
ladyship
oh
yes
an
she
is
said
richard
in
the
matter
of
puddins
and
pies
and
such
like
he
was
not
going
to
admit
jones
superiority
seeing
that
he
had
lived
in
the
family
long
before
his
present
mistress
marriage
and
in
a
great
many
other
things
too
richard
she
quite
a
confidential
servant
that
because
she
a
protestant
you
know
now
of
all
men
women
and
creatures
living
richard
the
coachman
of
castle
richmond
was
the
most
good
tempered
no
amount
of
anger
or
scolding
no
professional
misfortune
such
as
the
falling
down
of
his
horse
upon
the
ice
no
hardship
such
as
three
hours
perpetual
rain
when
he
was
upon
the
box
would
make
him
cross
to
him
it
was
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
if
he
were
sent
off
with
his
car
just
before
breakfast
or
called
away
to
some
stable
work
as
the
dinner
was
about
to
smoke
in
the
servants
hall
he
was
a
great
eater
but
what
he
did
eat
one
day
he
could
eat
the
next
such
things
never
ruffled
him
nor
was
he
ever
known
to
say
that
such
a
job
was
his
work
he
was
always
willing
to
nurse
a
baby
or
dig
potatoes
or
cook
a
dinner
to
the
best
of
his
ability
when
asked
to
do
so
but
he
could
not
endure
to
be
made
less
of
than
a
protestant
and
of
all
protestants
he
could
not
endure
to
be
made
less
of
than
jones
she
a
protestant
is
it
of
course
richard
you
ca
but
see
that
protestants
are
more
trusted
more
respected
more
thought
about
than
romanists
can
you
then
i
do
know
but
look
at
mrs
jones
oh
i
looks
at
her
often
enough
and
she
well
enough
too
for
a
woman
but
we
all
know
her
weakness
what
that
richard
asked
townsend
with
some
interest
expressed
in
her
tone
for
she
was
not
above
listening
to
a
little
scandal
even
about
the
servants
of
her
great
neighbours
why
she
do
often
talk
about
things
she
do
understand
but
a
great
hand
at
puddins
and
pies
and
that
what
one
mostly
looks
for
in
a
woman
this
was
enough
for
townsend
for
the
present
and
so
richard
was
allowed
to
take
his
departure
in
full
that
he
had
been
one
too
many
for
the
parson
wife
jerry
said
richard
as
they
walked
out
into
the
yard
together
to
get
the
castle
richmond
pony
does
they
often
thry
to
make
a
prothestant
of
you
now
prothestants
be
d
said
jerry
who
by
no
means
shared
in
richard
good
gifts
as
to
temper
well
i
would
say
that
at
laist
not
of
all
of
the
likes
of
them
used
to
it
said
jerry
and
then
richard
not
waiting
to
do
further
battle
on
behalf
of
his
protestant
friends
trotted
out
of
the
yard
chapter
xi
second
love
on
the
day
after
clara
departure
herbert
did
as
a
matter
of
course
make
his
promised
visit
at
desmond
court
it
was
on
that
day
that
sir
thomas
had
been
driving
about
in
the
with
lady
fitzgerald
as
richard
had
reported
herbert
had
been
with
his
father
in
the
morning
and
then
having
seen
him
and
his
mother
well
packed
up
in
their
shawls
and
cloaks
had
mounted
his
horse
and
ridden
off
i
may
be
kept
some
time
said
he
as
i
have
promised
to
go
on
to
clady
and
see
after
that
soup
kitchen
i
should
wonder
if
herbert
became
attached
to
clara
desmond
said
the
mother
to
sir
thomas
soon
after
they
had
begun
their
excursion
do
you
think
so
said
the
baronet
and
his
tone
was
certainly
not
exactly
that
of
approbation
well
yes
i
certainly
do
think
it
probable
i
am
sure
he
admires
her
and
i
think
it
very
likely
to
come
to
more
would
there
be
any
objection
they
are
both
very
young
said
sir
thomas
but
in
herbert
position
will
not
a
young
marriage
be
the
best
thing
for
him
and
she
has
no
fortune
not
a
shilling
if
he
does
marry
young
quite
young
you
know
it
might
be
prudent
that
his
wife
should
have
something
of
her
own
they
live
here
said
lady
fitzgerald
who
knew
that
of
all
men
her
husband
was
usually
most
free
from
mercenary
feelings
and
an
as
to
increased
wealth
either
for
himself
or
for
his
children
and
i
think
it
would
be
such
a
comfort
to
you
herbert
you
see
is
so
fond
of
county
business
and
so
little
anxious
for
what
young
men
generally
consider
pleasure
there
was
nothing
more
said
about
it
at
that
moment
for
the
question
in
some
measure
touched
upon
money
matters
and
considerations
as
to
property
from
all
of
which
lady
fitzgerald
at
present
wished
to
keep
her
husband
mind
free
but
towards
the
end
of
the
drive
he
himself
again
referred
to
it
she
is
a
nice
girl
is
she
very
nice
i
think
as
far
as
i
seen
her
she
is
pretty
certainly
very
pretty
more
than
pretty
much
more
she
will
be
beautiful
but
she
is
such
a
mere
child
you
do
not
think
that
anything
will
come
of
it
immediately
not
quite
immediately
oh
no
certainly
not
quite
immediately
i
think
herbert
is
not
calculated
to
be
very
sudden
in
any
such
feelings
or
in
the
expression
of
them
but
i
do
think
such
an
event
very
probable
before
the
winter
is
over
in
the
mean
time
herbert
spent
the
whole
day
over
at
desmond
court
or
at
clady
he
found
the
countess
delighted
to
see
him
and
both
she
and
lady
clara
went
on
with
him
to
clady
it
was
past
five
and
quite
dark
before
he
reached
castle
richmond
so
that
he
barely
got
home
in
time
to
dress
for
dinner
the
that
evening
was
more
pleasant
than
usual
sir
thomas
not
only
dined
with
them
but
came
into
the
after
dinner
and
to
a
certain
extent
joined
in
their
conversation
lady
fitzgerald
could
see
that
this
was
done
by
a
great
effort
but
it
was
not
remarked
by
aunt
letty
and
the
others
who
were
delighted
to
have
him
with
them
and
to
see
him
once
more
interested
about
their
interests
and
now
the
building
of
the
mill
had
been
settled
and
the
final
orders
were
to
be
given
by
herbert
at
the
spot
on
the
following
morning
we
can
go
with
you
to
berryhill
i
suppose
ca
we
said
mary
i
shall
be
in
a
great
hurry
said
herbert
who
clearly
did
not
wish
to
be
encumbered
by
his
sisters
on
this
special
expedition
and
why
are
you
to
be
in
such
a
hurry
asked
aunt
letty
well
i
shall
be
hurried
i
have
promised
to
go
to
clady
again
and
i
must
be
back
here
early
and
must
get
another
horse
why
herbert
you
are
becoming
a
hercules
of
energy
said
his
father
smiling
you
will
have
enough
to
do
if
you
look
to
all
the
soup
kitchens
on
the
desmond
property
as
well
as
our
own
i
made
a
sort
of
promise
about
this
particular
affair
at
clady
and
i
must
carry
it
out
said
herbert
and
you
pay
your
devoirs
to
the
fair
lady
clara
on
your
way
home
of
course
said
mary
more
than
probable
he
replied
and
stay
so
late
again
that
you
hardly
be
here
in
time
for
dinner
continued
mary
to
which
little
sally
her
brother
vouchsafed
no
answer
but
emmeline
said
nothing
lady
clara
was
specially
her
friend
and
she
was
too
anxious
to
secure
such
a
to
make
any
joke
upon
such
a
subject
on
that
occasion
nothing
more
was
said
about
it
but
sir
thomas
hoped
within
his
heart
that
his
wife
was
right
in
prophesying
that
his
son
would
do
nothing
sudden
in
this
matter
on
the
following
morning
young
fitzgerald
gave
the
necessary
orders
at
berryhill
very
quickly
and
then
coming
back
remounted
another
horse
without
going
into
the
house
then
he
trotted
off
to
clady
passing
the
gate
of
desmond
court
without
calling
did
what
he
had
promised
to
do
at
clady
or
rather
that
which
he
had
made
to
stand
as
an
excuse
for
again
visiting
that
part
of
the
world
so
quickly
and
after
that
with
a
conscience
let
us
hope
quite
clear
rode
up
the
avenue
at
desmond
court
it
was
still
early
in
the
day
when
he
got
there
probably
not
much
after
two
and
yet
mary
had
been
quite
correct
in
foretelling
that
he
would
only
be
home
just
in
time
for
dinner
but
nevertheless
he
had
not
seen
lady
desmond
why
or
how
it
had
occurred
that
she
had
been
absent
from
the
the
whole
of
the
two
hours
which
he
had
passed
in
the
house
it
may
be
unnecessary
to
explain
such
however
had
been
the
fact
the
first
five
minutes
had
been
passed
in
inquiries
after
the
bruise
and
it
must
be
owned
in
a
surgical
inspection
of
the
still
discoloured
arm
it
must
be
very
painful
he
had
said
looking
into
her
face
as
though
by
doing
so
he
could
swear
that
he
would
so
willingly
bear
all
the
pain
himself
if
it
were
only
possible
to
make
such
an
exchange
not
very
she
had
answered
smiling
it
is
only
a
little
stiff
i
ca
quite
move
it
easily
and
then
she
lifted
it
up
and
afterwards
dropped
it
with
a
little
look
of
pain
that
ran
through
his
heart
the
next
five
minutes
were
taken
up
in
discussing
the
case
of
the
recusant
boiler
and
then
clara
discovered
that
she
had
better
go
and
fetch
her
mother
but
against
the
immediate
taking
of
this
step
he
had
alleged
some
valid
reason
and
so
they
had
gone
on
till
the
dark
night
admonished
him
that
he
could
do
no
more
than
save
the
dinner
hour
at
castle
richmond
the
room
was
nearly
dark
when
he
left
her
and
she
got
up
and
stood
at
the
front
window
so
that
unseen
she
might
see
his
figure
as
he
rode
off
from
the
house
he
mounted
his
horse
within
the
quadrangle
and
coming
out
at
the
great
ugly
portal
galloped
off
across
the
green
park
with
a
loose
rein
and
a
happy
heart
what
is
it
the
song
says
oh
ladies
beware
of
a
gay
young
knight
who
loves
and
who
rides
away
there
was
at
clara
heart
as
she
stood
there
at
the
window
some
feeling
of
the
expediency
of
being
beware
some
shadow
of
doubt
as
to
the
wisdom
of
what
she
had
done
he
rode
away
gaily
with
a
happy
spirit
for
he
had
won
that
on
the
winning
of
which
he
had
been
intent
no
necessity
for
caution
presented
itself
to
him
he
had
seen
and
loved
had
then
asked
and
had
not
asked
in
vain
she
stood
gazing
after
him
as
long
as
her
straining
eye
could
catch
any
outline
of
his
figure
as
it
disappeared
through
the
gloom
of
the
evening
as
long
as
she
could
see
him
or
even
fancy
that
she
still
saw
him
she
thought
only
of
his
excellence
of
his
high
character
his
kind
heart
his
talents
which
in
her
estimation
were
ranked
perhaps
above
their
real
value
his
tastes
which
coincided
so
well
with
her
own
his
quiet
yet
manly
bearing
his
useful
pursuits
his
gait
appearance
and
demeanour
all
these
were
of
a
nature
to
win
the
heart
of
such
a
girl
as
clara
desmond
and
then
probably
in
some
indistinct
way
she
remembered
the
broad
acres
to
which
he
was
the
heir
and
comforted
herself
by
reflecting
that
this
at
least
was
a
match
which
none
would
think
disgraceful
for
a
daughter
even
of
an
earl
of
desmond
but
sadder
thoughts
did
come
when
that
figure
had
wholly
disappeared
her
eye
looking
out
into
the
darkness
could
not
but
see
another
figure
on
which
it
had
often
in
past
times
delighted
almost
unconsciously
to
dwell
there
walking
on
that
very
road
another
lover
another
fitzgerald
had
sworn
that
he
loved
her
and
had
truly
sworn
so
as
she
well
knew
she
had
never
doubted
his
truth
to
her
and
did
not
doubt
it
now
and
yet
she
had
given
herself
away
to
another
and
in
many
things
he
too
that
other
lover
had
been
noble
and
gracious
and
fit
for
a
woman
to
love
in
person
he
exceeded
all
that
she
had
ever
seen
or
dreamed
of
and
why
should
we
think
that
personal
excellence
is
to
count
for
nothing
in
female
judgment
when
in
that
of
men
it
ranks
so
immeasurably
above
all
other
excellences
his
bearing
too
was
chivalrous
and
bold
his
language
full
of
poetry
and
his
manner
of
loving
eager
impetuous
and
of
a
kin
to
worship
then
too
he
was
now
in
misfortune
and
when
has
that
failed
to
soften
even
the
softness
of
a
woman
heart
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
not
make
comparisons
comparisons
that
were
so
distasteful
to
her
impossible
also
that
she
should
not
accuse
herself
of
some
falseness
to
that
first
lover
the
time
to
us
my
friends
seems
short
enough
since
she
was
walking
there
and
listening
with
childish
delight
to
owen
protestations
of
love
it
was
but
little
more
than
one
year
since
but
to
her
those
months
had
been
very
long
and
reader
if
thou
hast
arrived
at
any
period
of
life
which
enables
thee
to
count
thy
past
years
by
lustrums
if
thou
art
at
a
time
of
life
past
thirty
we
will
say
hast
thou
not
found
that
thy
years
which
are
now
short
enough
were
long
in
those
bygone
days
those
fourteen
months
were
to
her
the
space
almost
of
a
second
life
as
she
now
looked
back
upon
them
when
those
earlier
vows
were
made
what
had
she
cared
for
prudence
for
the
world
esteem
or
an
alliance
that
might
be
becoming
to
her
that
owen
fitzgerald
was
a
gentleman
of
high
blood
and
ancient
family
so
much
she
had
cared
to
know
for
the
rest
she
had
only
cared
to
feel
this
that
her
heart
beat
high
with
pleasure
when
he
was
with
her
did
her
heart
beat
as
high
now
when
his
cousin
was
beside
her
no
she
felt
that
it
did
not
and
sometimes
she
felt
or
feared
to
feel
that
it
might
beat
high
again
when
she
should
again
see
the
lover
whom
her
judgment
had
rejected
her
judgment
had
rejected
him
altogether
long
before
an
idea
had
at
all
presented
itself
to
her
that
herbert
fitzgerald
could
become
her
suitor
nor
had
this
been
done
wholly
in
obedience
to
her
mandate
she
had
realized
in
her
own
mind
the
conviction
that
owen
fitzgerald
was
not
a
man
with
whom
any
girl
could
at
present
safely
link
her
fortune
she
knew
well
that
he
was
idle
dissipated
and
extravagant
and
she
could
not
believe
that
these
vices
had
arisen
only
from
his
banishment
from
her
and
that
they
would
cease
and
vanish
whenever
that
banishment
might
cease
messages
came
to
her
in
underhand
ways
ways
well
understood
in
ireland
and
not
always
ignored
in
england
to
the
effect
that
all
his
misdoings
arose
from
his
unhappiness
that
he
drank
and
gambled
only
because
the
gates
of
desmond
court
were
no
longer
open
to
him
there
was
that
in
clara
heart
which
did
for
a
while
predispose
her
to
believe
somewhat
of
this
to
hope
that
it
might
not
be
altogether
false
could
any
girl
loving
such
a
man
not
have
had
some
such
hope
but
then
the
stories
of
these
revelries
became
worse
and
worse
and
it
was
dinned
into
her
ears
that
these
doings
had
been
running
on
in
all
their
enormity
before
that
day
of
his
banishment
and
so
silently
and
sadly
with
no
outspoken
word
either
to
mother
or
brother
she
had
resolved
to
give
him
up
there
was
no
necessity
to
her
for
any
outspoken
word
she
had
promised
her
mother
to
hold
no
intercourse
with
the
man
and
she
had
kept
and
would
keep
her
promise
why
say
more
about
it
how
she
might
have
reconciled
her
promise
to
her
mother
with
an
enduring
engagement
had
owen
fitzgerald
conduct
allowed
her
to
regard
her
engagement
as
enduring
that
had
been
a
sore
trouble
to
her
while
hope
had
remained
but
now
no
hope
remained
and
that
trouble
was
over
and
then
herbert
fitzgerald
had
come
across
her
path
and
those
sweet
loving
kind
fitzgerald
girls
who
were
always
ready
to
cover
her
with
such
sweet
caresses
with
whom
she
had
known
more
of
the
happiness
of
friendliness
than
ever
she
had
felt
before
they
threw
themselves
upon
her
like
sisters
and
she
had
never
before
enjoyed
sisterly
treatment
he
had
come
across
her
path
and
from
the
first
moment
she
had
become
conscious
of
his
admiration
she
knew
herself
to
be
penniless
and
dreaded
that
she
should
be
looked
upon
as
wishing
to
catch
the
rich
heir
but
every
one
had
conspired
to
throw
them
together
lady
fitzgerald
had
welcomed
her
like
a
mother
with
more
caressing
soft
tenderness
than
her
own
mother
usually
vouchsafed
to
her
and
even
sir
thomas
had
gone
out
of
his
usual
way
to
be
kind
to
her
that
her
mother
would
approve
of
such
a
marriage
she
could
not
doubt
lady
desmond
in
these
latter
days
had
not
said
much
to
her
about
owen
but
she
had
said
very
much
of
the
horrors
of
poverty
and
she
had
been
too
subtle
to
praise
the
virtues
of
herbert
with
open
plain
words
but
she
had
praised
the
comforts
of
a
handsome
income
and
family
mansion
clara
at
these
times
had
understood
more
than
had
been
intended
and
had
therefore
put
herself
on
her
guard
against
her
mother
worldly
wisdom
but
nevertheless
the
dropping
of
the
water
had
in
some
little
measure
hollowed
the
stone
beneath
and
thus
thinking
of
these
things
she
stood
at
the
window
for
some
after
the
form
of
her
accepted
lover
had
become
invisible
in
the
gathering
gloom
of
the
evening
and
then
her
mother
entered
the
room
and
candles
were
brought
lady
desmond
was
all
smiles
and
benignity
as
she
had
been
for
this
last
week
past
while
herbert
fitzgerald
had
been
coming
and
going
almost
daily
at
desmond
court
but
clara
understood
this
benignity
and
disliked
it
it
was
however
now
necessary
that
everything
should
be
told
herbert
had
declared
that
he
should
at
once
inform
his
father
and
mother
and
obtain
their
permission
for
his
marriage
he
spoke
of
it
as
a
matter
on
which
there
was
no
occasion
for
any
doubt
or
misgiving
he
was
an
only
son
he
said
and
trusted
and
loved
in
everything
his
father
never
opposed
him
on
any
subject
whatever
and
would
he
was
sure
consent
to
any
match
he
might
propose
but
as
to
you
he
added
with
a
lover
flattering
fervour
they
are
all
so
fond
of
you
they
all
think
so
much
of
you
that
my
only
fear
is
that
i
shall
be
jealous
they
all
make
love
to
you
aunt
letty
included
it
was
therefore
essential
that
she
should
at
once
tell
her
mother
and
ask
her
mother
leave
she
had
once
before
confessed
a
tale
of
love
and
had
done
so
with
palpitation
of
the
heart
with
trembling
of
the
limbs
and
floods
of
tears
then
her
tale
had
been
received
with
harsh
sternness
now
she
could
tell
her
story
without
any
trembling
with
no
tears
but
it
was
almost
indifferent
to
her
whether
her
mother
was
harsh
or
tender
what
has
fitzgerald
gone
said
the
countess
on
entering
the
room
yes
mamma
this
said
clara
not
as
yet
coming
away
from
the
window
i
did
not
hear
his
horse
and
imagined
he
was
here
still
i
hope
he
has
not
thought
me
terribly
uncivil
but
i
could
not
well
leave
what
i
was
doing
to
this
little
speech
clara
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
return
any
answer
she
was
thinking
how
she
would
begin
to
say
that
for
saying
which
there
was
so
strong
a
necessity
and
she
could
not
take
a
part
in
small
false
badinage
on
a
subject
which
was
so
near
her
heart
and
what
about
that
stupid
mason
at
clady
asked
the
countess
still
making
believe
fitzgerald
was
there
again
mamma
and
i
think
it
will
be
all
right
now
but
he
did
not
say
much
about
it
why
not
you
were
all
so
full
of
it
yesterday
clara
who
had
half
turned
round
towards
the
light
now
again
turned
herself
towards
the
window
this
task
must
be
done
but
the
doing
of
it
was
so
disagreeable
how
was
she
to
tell
her
mother
that
she
loved
this
man
seeing
that
so
short
a
time
since
she
had
declared
that
she
loved
another
and
what
was
he
talking
about
love
said
the
countess
ever
so
graciously
or
perhaps
no
questioning
on
the
matter
can
be
allowed
may
i
ask
questions
or
may
i
not
eh
clara
and
then
the
mother
walking
up
towards
the
window
put
her
fair
white
hands
upon
her
daughter
two
shoulders
of
course
you
may
inquire
said
clara
then
i
do
inquire
immediately
what
has
this
been
saying
to
my
clara
that
makes
her
stand
thus
solemn
and
silent
gazing
out
into
the
dark
night
mamma
well
love
herbert
fitzgerald
has
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
he
has
proposed
to
me
the
mother
arm
now
encircled
the
daughter
lovingly
and
the
mother
lips
were
pressed
to
the
daughter
forehead
herbert
fitzgerald
has
asked
you
to
be
his
wife
has
he
and
what
answer
has
my
bonny
bird
deigned
to
make
to
so
audacious
a
request
lady
desmond
had
never
before
spoken
to
her
daughter
in
tones
so
gracious
in
a
manner
so
flattering
so
caressing
so
affectionate
but
clara
would
not
open
her
heart
to
her
mother
tenderness
she
could
not
look
into
her
mother
face
and
welcome
her
consent
with
unutterable
joy
as
she
would
have
done
had
that
consent
been
given
a
year
since
to
a
less
prudent
proposition
that
marriage
for
which
she
was
now
to
ask
her
mother
sanction
would
of
course
be
sanctioned
she
had
no
favour
to
beg
nothing
for
which
to
be
grateful
with
a
slight
motion
unconsciously
unwillingly
but
not
the
less
positively
she
repulsed
her
mother
caress
as
she
answered
her
question
i
have
accepted
him
mamma
that
is
of
course
if
you
do
not
object
my
own
own
child
said
the
countess
seizing
her
daughter
in
her
arms
and
pressing
her
to
her
bosom
and
in
truth
clara
was
now
probably
for
the
first
time
her
own
heart
daughter
her
son
though
he
was
but
a
poor
earl
was
earl
of
desmond
he
too
though
in
truth
but
a
poor
earl
was
not
absolutely
destitute
would
in
truth
be
blessed
with
a
fair
future
but
lady
clara
had
hitherto
been
felt
only
as
a
weight
she
had
been
born
poor
as
poverty
itself
and
hitherto
had
shown
so
little
disposition
to
find
for
herself
a
remedy
for
this
crushing
evil
but
now
now
matters
were
indeed
changed
she
had
obtained
for
herself
the
best
match
in
the
whole
country
round
and
in
doing
so
had
sacrificed
her
heart
young
love
was
she
not
entitled
to
all
a
mother
tenderness
who
knew
who
could
know
the
miseries
of
poverty
so
well
as
the
countess
of
desmond
who
then
could
feel
so
much
gratitude
to
a
child
for
prudently
escaping
from
them
lady
desmond
did
feel
grateful
to
her
daughter
my
own
own
child
my
happy
girl
she
repeated
he
is
a
man
to
whom
any
mother
in
all
the
land
would
be
proud
to
see
her
daughter
married
never
never
did
i
see
a
young
man
so
perfectly
worthy
of
a
girl
love
he
is
so
thoroughly
well
educated
so
thoroughly
well
conducted
so
so
so
advantageously
situated
in
all
his
circumstances
of
course
he
will
go
into
parliament
and
then
any
course
is
open
to
him
the
property
is
i
believe
wholly
unembarrassed
and
there
are
no
younger
brothers
you
may
say
that
the
place
is
his
own
already
for
old
sir
thomas
is
almost
nobody
i
do
wish
you
joy
my
own
dearest
dearest
clara
after
which
burst
of
maternal
eloquence
the
countess
pressed
her
lips
to
those
of
her
child
and
gave
her
a
mother
warmest
kiss
clara
was
conscious
that
she
was
thoroughly
dissatisfied
with
her
mother
but
she
could
not
exactly
say
why
it
was
so
she
did
return
her
mother
kiss
but
she
did
it
coldly
and
with
lips
that
were
not
eager
i
glad
you
think
that
i
have
done
right
mamma
right
my
love
of
course
i
think
that
you
have
done
right
only
i
give
you
no
credit
dearest
none
in
the
least
for
how
could
you
help
loving
one
so
lovable
in
every
way
as
dear
herbert
credit
no
there
is
no
credit
she
said
not
choosing
to
share
her
mother
pleasantry
but
there
is
this
credit
had
you
not
been
one
of
the
sweetest
girls
that
ever
was
born
he
would
not
have
loved
you
he
has
loved
me
because
there
was
no
one
else
here
said
clara
nonsense
no
one
else
here
indeed
has
he
not
the
power
if
he
pleases
to
go
and
choose
whomever
he
will
in
all
london
had
he
been
mercenary
and
wanted
money
said
the
countess
in
a
tone
which
showed
how
thoroughly
she
despised
any
such
vice
he
might
have
had
what
he
would
but
then
he
could
not
have
had
my
clara
but
he
has
looked
for
beauty
and
manners
and
tastes
and
an
affectionate
heart
and
in
my
opinion
he
could
not
have
been
more
successful
in
his
search
after
which
second
burst
of
eloquence
she
again
kissed
her
daughter
was
thus
at
that
moment
that
she
congratulated
the
wife
of
the
future
sir
herbert
fitzgerald
and
then
she
allowed
clara
to
go
up
to
her
own
room
there
to
meditate
quietly
on
what
she
had
done
and
on
that
which
she
was
about
to
do
but
late
in
the
evening
lady
desmond
whose
mind
was
thoroughly
full
of
the
subject
again
broke
out
into
triumph
you
must
write
to
patrick
clara
he
must
hear
the
good
news
from
no
one
but
yourself
had
we
not
better
wait
a
little
mamma
why
my
love
you
hardly
know
how
anxious
your
brother
is
for
your
welfare
i
knew
it
was
right
to
tell
you
mamma
right
to
tell
me
of
course
it
was
you
could
not
have
had
the
heart
to
keep
it
from
me
for
half
a
day
but
perhaps
it
may
be
better
not
to
mention
it
further
till
we
know
till
we
know
what
said
the
countess
with
a
look
of
fear
about
her
brow
whether
sir
thomas
and
lady
fitzgerald
will
wish
it
if
they
object
object
why
should
they
object
how
can
they
object
they
are
not
mercenary
people
and
you
are
an
earl
daughter
and
herbert
is
not
like
a
girl
the
property
is
his
own
entailed
on
him
and
he
may
do
as
he
pleases
in
such
a
matter
i
am
sure
he
would
not
wish
to
displease
either
his
father
or
his
mother
nonsense
my
dear
quite
nonsense
you
do
not
at
all
see
the
difference
between
a
young
man
and
a
girl
he
has
a
right
to
do
exactly
as
he
likes
in
such
a
matter
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
they
will
not
object
why
should
they
how
can
they
fitzgerald
says
that
they
will
not
clara
admitted
almost
grudgingly
of
course
they
will
not
i
do
suppose
they
could
bring
themselves
to
object
to
anything
he
might
suggest
i
never
knew
a
young
man
so
happily
situated
in
this
respect
he
is
quite
a
free
agent
i
think
they
would
say
much
to
him
if
he
insisted
on
marrying
the
indeed
it
seems
to
me
that
his
word
is
quite
paramount
at
castle
richmond
all
the
same
mamma
i
would
rather
not
write
to
patrick
till
something
more
has
been
settled
you
are
wrong
there
clara
if
anything
disagreeable
should
happen
which
is
quite
impossible
it
would
be
absolutely
necessary
that
your
brother
should
know
believe
me
my
love
i
only
advise
you
for
your
own
good
but
fitzgerald
will
probably
be
here
or
if
not
next
day
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
love
but
why
do
you
call
him
fitzgerald
you
were
calling
him
herbert
the
other
day
do
you
remember
how
i
scolded
you
i
should
not
scold
you
now
clara
made
no
answer
to
this
and
then
the
subject
was
allowed
to
rest
for
that
night
she
would
call
him
herbert
she
said
to
herself
but
not
to
her
mother
she
would
keep
the
use
of
that
name
till
she
could
talk
with
emmeline
as
a
sister
of
all
her
anticipated
pleasures
that
of
having
now
a
real
sister
was
perhaps
the
greatest
or
rather
that
of
being
able
to
talk
about
herbert
with
one
whom
she
could
love
and
treat
as
a
sister
but
herbert
himself
would
exact
the
use
of
his
own
christian
name
for
the
delight
of
his
own
ears
that
was
a
matter
of
course
that
doubtless
had
been
already
done
and
then
mother
and
daughter
went
to
bed
the
countess
as
she
did
so
was
certainly
happy
to
her
heart
core
could
it
be
that
she
had
some
hope
unrecognized
by
herself
that
owen
fitzgerald
might
now
once
more
be
welcomed
at
desmond
court
that
something
might
now
be
done
to
rescue
him
from
that
slough
of
despond
and
clara
too
was
happy
though
her
happiness
was
mixed
she
did
love
herbert
fitzgerald
she
was
sure
of
that
she
said
so
to
herself
over
and
over
again
love
him
of
course
she
loved
him
and
would
cherish
him
as
her
lord
and
husband
to
the
last
day
of
her
life
the
last
gasp
of
her
breath
but
still
as
sleep
came
upon
her
eyelids
she
saw
in
her
memory
the
bright
flash
of
that
other
lover
countenance
when
he
first
astonished
her
with
the
avowal
of
his
love
as
he
walked
beside
her
under
the
elms
with
his
horse
following
at
his
heels
chapter
xii
doubts
i
believe
there
is
no
period
of
life
so
happy
as
that
in
which
a
thriving
lover
leaves
his
mistress
after
his
first
success
his
joy
is
more
perfect
then
than
at
the
absolute
moment
of
his
own
eager
vow
and
her
blushes
then
he
is
thinking
mostly
of
her
and
is
to
a
certain
degree
embarrassed
by
the
effort
necessary
for
success
but
when
the
promise
has
once
been
given
to
him
and
he
is
able
to
escape
into
the
domain
of
his
own
heart
he
is
as
a
conqueror
who
has
mastered
half
a
continent
by
his
own
strategy
it
never
occurs
to
him
he
hardly
believes
that
his
success
is
no
more
than
that
which
is
the
ordinary
lot
of
mortal
man
he
never
reflects
that
all
the
old
married
fogies
whom
he
knows
and
despises
have
just
as
much
ground
for
pride
if
such
pride
were
enduring
that
every
fat
silent
dull
somnolent
old
lady
whom
he
sees
and
quizzes
has
at
some
period
been
deemed
as
worthy
a
prize
as
his
priceless
galleon
and
so
deemed
by
as
bold
a
captor
as
himself
some
one
has
said
that
every
young
mother
when
her
first
child
is
born
regards
the
babe
as
the
most
wonderful
production
of
that
description
which
the
world
has
yet
seen
and
this
too
is
true
but
i
doubt
even
whether
that
conviction
is
so
strong
as
the
conviction
of
the
young
successful
lover
that
he
has
achieved
a
triumph
which
should
ennoble
him
down
to
late
generations
as
he
goes
along
he
has
a
contempt
for
other
men
for
they
know
nothing
of
such
glory
as
his
as
he
pores
over
his
blackstone
he
remembers
that
he
does
so
not
so
much
that
he
may
acquire
law
as
that
he
may
acquire
fanny
and
then
all
other
porers
over
blackstone
are
low
and
mean
in
his
sight
are
mercenary
in
their
views
and
unfortunate
in
their
ideas
for
they
have
no
fanny
in
view
herbert
fitzgerald
had
this
proud
feeling
strong
within
his
heart
as
he
galloped
away
across
the
greensward
and
trotted
fast
along
the
road
home
to
castle
richmond
she
was
compounded
of
all
excellences
so
he
swore
to
himself
over
and
over
again
and
being
so
compounded
she
had
consented
to
bestow
all
these
excellences
upon
him
being
herself
she
had
promised
to
take
him
as
the
object
of
her
world
worship
so
he
trotted
on
fast
and
faster
as
though
conscious
of
the
which
he
had
won
by
his
skill
and
valour
she
had
told
him
about
his
cousin
owen
indeed
the
greater
number
of
the
soft
musical
words
which
she
had
spoken
in
that
long
three
colloquy
had
been
spoken
on
this
special
point
it
had
behoved
her
to
tell
him
all
and
she
thought
that
she
had
done
so
nay
she
had
done
so
with
absolute
truth
to
the
best
of
her
heart
power
you
were
so
young
then
he
had
argued
so
very
young
yes
very
young
i
am
not
very
old
now
you
know
and
she
smiled
sweetly
on
him
no
no
but
a
year
makes
so
much
difference
you
were
all
but
a
child
then
you
do
not
love
him
now
clara
no
i
do
not
love
him
now
she
had
answered
and
then
he
exacted
a
second
a
third
a
fourth
assurance
that
she
did
absolutely
actually
and
with
her
whole
heart
love
him
him
herbert
in
lieu
of
that
other
him
poor
owen
and
with
this
he
herbert
was
contented
content
nay
but
proud
elated
with
triumph
and
conscious
of
victory
in
this
spirit
he
rode
home
as
fast
as
his
horse
could
carry
him
he
too
had
to
tell
his
tale
to
those
to
whom
he
owed
obedience
and
to
beg
that
they
would
look
upon
his
intended
bride
with
eyes
of
love
and
with
parental
affection
but
in
this
respect
he
was
hardly
troubled
with
more
doubt
than
clara
had
felt
how
could
any
one
object
to
his
clara
there
are
young
men
who
from
their
positions
in
life
are
obliged
to
abstain
from
early
marriage
or
to
look
for
dowries
with
their
wives
but
he
luckily
was
not
fettered
in
this
way
he
could
marry
as
he
pleased
so
long
as
she
whom
he
might
choose
brought
with
her
gentle
blood
a
good
heart
a
sweet
temper
and
such
attraction
of
person
and
manners
as
might
make
the
establishment
at
castle
richmond
proud
of
his
young
bride
and
of
whom
could
that
establishment
be
more
proud
than
of
lady
clara
desmond
so
he
rode
home
without
any
doubt
to
clog
his
happiness
but
he
had
a
source
of
joy
which
clara
wanted
she
was
almost
indifferent
to
her
mother
satisfaction
but
herbert
looked
forward
with
the
liveliest
keenest
anticipation
to
his
mother
gratified
caresses
and
unqualified
approval
to
his
father
kind
smile
and
warm
assurance
of
consent
clara
had
made
herself
known
at
castle
richmond
and
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
all
this
would
be
added
to
his
cup
of
happiness
there
was
therefore
no
alloy
to
debase
his
virgin
gold
as
he
trotted
quickly
into
the
but
he
resolved
that
he
would
say
nothing
about
the
matter
that
night
he
could
not
well
tell
them
all
in
full
conclave
together
early
after
breakfast
he
would
go
to
his
father
room
and
after
that
he
would
find
his
mother
there
would
then
be
no
doubt
that
the
news
would
duly
leak
out
among
his
sisters
and
aunt
letty
again
only
just
barely
in
time
herbert
said
mary
as
they
clustered
round
the
fire
before
dinner
you
ca
say
i
ever
keep
you
waiting
and
i
really
think
some
praise
for
a
man
who
has
got
a
good
many
things
on
his
hand
so
it
is
herbert
said
emmeline
but
we
have
done
something
too
we
have
been
over
to
berryhill
and
the
people
have
already
begun
there
they
were
at
work
with
their
pickaxes
among
the
rocks
by
the
so
much
the
better
was
somers
there
we
did
not
see
him
but
he
had
been
there
said
aunt
letty
but
townsend
found
us
and
who
do
you
think
came
up
to
us
in
the
most
courteous
affable
condescending
way
who
i
do
know
brady
the
builder
i
suppose
no
indeed
brady
was
not
half
so
civil
for
he
kept
himself
to
his
own
work
it
was
the
rev
if
you
please
i
only
hope
you
were
civil
to
him
said
herbert
with
some
slight
suffusion
of
colour
over
his
face
for
he
rather
doubted
the
conduct
of
his
aunt
to
the
priest
especially
as
her
great
protestant
ally
townsend
was
of
the
party
civil
i
do
know
what
you
would
have
unless
you
wanted
me
to
embrace
him
he
shook
hands
with
us
all
round
i
really
thought
townsend
would
have
looked
him
into
the
river
when
he
came
to
her
she
always
was
the
quintessence
of
absurdity
and
prejudice
said
he
oh
herbert
exclaimed
aunt
letty
well
and
what
of
herbert
i
say
she
is
so
if
you
and
mary
and
emmeline
did
not
look
him
into
the
river
when
he
shook
hands
with
you
why
should
she
do
so
he
is
an
ordained
priest
even
according
to
her
own
tenets
only
she
knows
nothing
of
what
her
own
tenets
are
i
tell
you
what
they
are
they
are
the
substantial
true
and
holy
doctrines
of
the
protestant
religion
founded
on
the
gospel
townsend
is
a
thoroughly
protestant
woman
one
who
can
not
abide
the
sorceries
of
popery
hates
them
as
a
mad
dog
hates
water
and
with
the
same
amount
of
judgment
we
none
of
us
wish
to
be
drowned
but
nevertheless
there
are
some
good
qualities
in
water
but
there
are
no
good
qualities
in
popery
said
aunt
letty
with
her
most
extreme
energy
are
there
not
said
herbert
i
should
have
thought
that
belief
in
christ
belief
in
the
bible
belief
in
the
doctrine
of
a
atonement
were
good
qualities
even
the
mahommedan
religion
has
some
qualities
that
are
good
i
would
sooner
be
a
mahommedan
than
a
papist
said
aunt
letty
somewhat
thoughtlessly
but
very
stoutly
you
would
alter
your
opinion
after
the
first
week
in
a
harem
said
herbert
and
then
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
in
which
aunt
letty
herself
joined
i
would
sooner
go
there
than
go
to
confession
she
whispered
to
mary
as
they
all
walked
off
to
dinner
and
how
is
the
lady
clara
arm
asked
mary
as
soon
as
they
were
again
once
more
round
the
fire
the
lady
clara
arm
is
still
very
blue
said
herbert
and
i
suppose
it
took
you
half
an
hour
to
weep
over
it
continued
his
sister
exactly
by
shrewsbury
clock
and
while
you
were
weeping
over
the
arm
what
happened
to
the
hand
she
did
not
surrender
it
did
she
in
return
for
so
much
tenderness
on
your
part
emmeline
thought
that
mary
was
very
pertinacious
in
her
badinage
and
was
going
to
bid
her
hold
her
tongue
but
she
observed
that
herbert
blushed
and
walked
away
without
further
answer
he
went
to
the
further
end
of
the
long
room
and
there
threw
himself
on
to
a
sofa
could
it
be
that
it
was
all
settled
thought
emmeline
to
herself
she
followed
him
to
the
sofa
and
sitting
beside
him
took
hold
of
his
arm
oh
herbert
if
there
is
anything
to
tell
do
tell
me
anything
to
tell
said
he
what
do
you
mean
oh
you
know
i
do
love
her
so
dearly
i
shall
never
be
contented
to
love
any
one
else
as
your
wife
not
to
love
her
really
really
with
all
my
heart
what
geese
you
girls
are
you
are
always
thinking
of
love
and
weddings
and
it
is
only
for
you
i
think
about
them
said
emmeline
i
know
there
is
something
to
tell
dear
herbert
do
tell
me
there
is
a
young
bachelor
duke
coming
here
he
has
a
million
a
year
and
three
counties
all
his
own
he
has
blue
eyes
and
is
the
handsomest
man
that
ever
was
seen
is
that
news
enough
very
well
herbert
i
would
tell
you
anything
well
tell
me
anything
i
tell
you
this
i
know
you
in
love
with
clara
desmond
and
i
sure
she
in
love
with
you
and
i
believe
you
are
both
engaged
and
you
not
nice
at
all
to
have
a
secret
from
me
i
never
tease
you
as
mary
does
and
it
would
make
me
so
happy
to
know
it
upon
this
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
whispered
one
word
into
her
ear
she
gave
an
exclamation
of
delight
and
as
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
congratulated
him
with
a
kiss
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
am
so
happy
she
exclaimed
hush
sh
he
whispered
i
knew
how
it
would
be
if
i
told
you
but
they
will
all
know
will
they
not
leave
that
to
me
you
have
coaxed
me
out
of
my
secret
and
you
are
bound
to
keep
it
and
then
he
went
away
well
pleased
this
description
of
delight
on
his
sister
part
was
the
first
instalment
of
that
joy
which
he
had
promised
himself
from
the
satisfaction
of
his
family
lady
fitzgerald
had
watched
all
that
had
passed
and
had
already
learned
her
mistake
her
mistake
in
that
she
had
prophesied
that
no
immediate
proposal
was
likely
to
be
made
by
her
son
she
now
knew
well
enough
that
he
had
made
such
a
proposal
and
that
he
had
been
accepted
and
this
greatly
grieved
her
she
had
felt
certain
from
the
few
slight
words
which
sir
thomas
had
spoken
that
there
were
valid
reasons
why
her
son
should
not
marry
a
penniless
girl
that
conversation
joined
to
other
things
to
the
man
visit
and
her
husband
deep
dejection
had
convinced
her
that
all
was
not
right
some
misfortune
was
impending
over
them
and
there
had
been
that
in
her
own
early
history
which
filled
her
with
dismay
as
she
thought
of
this
she
had
ardently
desired
to
caution
her
son
in
this
respect
to
guard
him
if
possible
against
future
disappointment
and
future
sorrow
but
she
could
not
do
so
without
obtaining
in
some
sort
her
husband
assent
to
her
doing
so
she
resolved
that
she
would
talk
it
over
with
sir
thomas
but
the
subject
was
one
so
full
of
pain
and
he
was
so
ill
and
therefore
she
had
put
it
off
and
now
she
saw
that
the
injury
was
done
nevertheless
she
said
nothing
either
to
emmeline
or
to
herbert
if
the
injury
were
done
what
good
could
now
result
from
talking
she
doubtless
would
hear
it
all
soon
enough
so
she
sat
still
watching
them
on
the
following
morning
sir
thomas
did
not
come
out
to
breakfast
herbert
went
into
his
room
quite
early
as
was
always
his
custom
and
as
he
left
it
for
the
he
said
father
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
just
now
about
something
of
importance
something
of
importance
herbert
what
is
it
anything
wrong
for
sir
thomas
was
nervous
and
easily
frightened
oh
dear
no
nothing
is
wrong
it
is
nothing
that
will
annoy
you
at
least
i
think
not
but
it
will
keep
till
after
breakfast
i
will
come
in
again
the
moment
breakfast
is
over
and
so
saying
he
left
the
room
with
a
light
step
in
the
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
everybody
was
conscious
of
some
important
fact
his
mother
kiss
was
peculiarly
solemn
and
full
of
solicitude
aunt
letty
smirked
as
though
she
was
aware
of
something
something
over
and
above
the
great
protestant
tenets
which
usually
supported
her
and
mary
had
no
joke
to
fling
at
him
emmeline
he
whispered
you
have
told
no
indeed
she
replied
but
what
mattered
it
everybody
would
know
now
in
a
few
minutes
so
he
ate
his
breakfast
and
then
returned
to
sir
thomas
father
said
he
as
soon
as
he
had
got
into
the
in
which
it
was
his
custom
to
sit
when
talking
with
sir
thomas
i
hope
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
will
give
you
pleasure
i
have
proposed
to
a
young
lady
and
she
has
accepted
me
you
have
proposed
and
have
been
accepted
yes
father
and
the
young
lady
is
lady
clara
desmond
i
hope
you
will
say
that
you
approve
of
it
she
has
no
fortune
as
we
all
know
but
that
will
hardly
matter
to
me
and
i
think
you
will
allow
that
in
every
other
respect
she
is
perfect
herbert
would
have
said
had
he
dared
to
express
his
true
meaning
but
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
for
a
less
triumphant
word
and
then
paused
again
and
left
his
sentence
incomplete
when
he
saw
the
expression
of
his
father
face
oh
father
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
do
not
like
her
but
it
was
not
dislike
that
was
expressed
in
his
father
face
as
herbert
felt
the
moment
after
he
had
spoken
there
was
pain
there
and
solicitude
and
disappointment
a
look
of
sorrow
at
the
tidings
thus
conveyed
to
him
but
nothing
that
seemed
to
betoken
dislike
of
any
person
what
is
it
sir
why
do
you
not
speak
to
me
can
it
be
that
you
disapprove
of
my
marrying
sir
thomas
certainly
did
disapprove
of
his
son
marrying
but
he
lacked
the
courage
to
say
so
much
misery
that
had
hitherto
come
upon
him
and
that
was
about
to
come
on
all
those
whom
he
loved
so
well
arose
from
this
lack
of
courage
he
did
not
dare
to
tell
his
son
that
he
advised
him
for
the
present
to
put
aside
all
such
hopes
it
would
have
been
terrible
for
him
to
do
so
but
he
knew
that
in
not
doing
so
he
was
occasioning
sorrow
that
would
be
more
terrible
and
yet
he
did
not
do
it
herbert
saw
clearly
that
the
project
was
distasteful
to
his
father
that
project
which
he
had
hoped
to
have
seen
received
with
so
much
delight
but
nothing
was
said
to
him
which
tended
to
make
him
alter
his
purpose
do
you
not
like
her
he
asked
his
father
almost
piteously
yes
yes
i
do
like
her
we
all
like
her
very
much
indeed
herbert
then
why
you
are
so
young
my
boy
and
she
is
so
very
young
and
and
what
why
herbert
it
is
not
always
practicable
for
the
son
even
of
a
man
of
property
to
marry
so
early
in
life
as
this
she
has
nothing
you
know
no
said
the
young
man
proudly
i
never
thought
of
looking
for
money
but
in
your
position
it
is
so
essential
if
a
young
man
wishes
to
marry
herbert
had
always
regarded
his
father
as
the
most
liberal
man
breathing
as
and
almost
to
a
fault
to
him
his
only
son
he
had
ever
been
so
refusing
him
nothing
and
latterly
allowing
him
to
do
almost
as
he
would
with
the
management
of
the
estate
he
could
not
understand
that
this
liberality
should
be
turned
to
parsimony
on
such
an
occasion
as
that
of
his
marriage
you
think
then
sir
that
i
ought
not
to
marry
lady
clara
said
herbert
very
bitterly
i
like
her
excessively
said
sir
thomas
i
think
she
is
a
sweet
girl
a
very
sweet
girl
all
that
i
or
your
mother
could
desire
to
see
in
your
wife
but
but
she
is
not
rich
do
not
speak
to
me
in
that
tone
my
boy
said
sir
thomas
with
an
expression
that
would
have
moved
his
enemy
to
pity
let
alone
his
son
his
son
did
pity
him
and
ceased
to
wear
the
angry
expression
of
face
which
had
so
wounded
his
father
but
father
i
do
not
understand
you
he
said
is
there
any
real
objection
why
i
should
not
marry
i
am
more
than
and
you
i
think
married
earlier
than
that
in
answer
to
this
sir
thomas
only
sighed
meekly
and
piteously
if
you
mean
to
say
continued
the
son
that
it
will
be
inconvenient
to
you
to
make
me
any
allowance
no
no
no
you
are
of
course
entitled
to
what
you
want
and
as
long
as
i
can
give
it
you
shall
have
it
as
long
as
you
can
give
it
father
as
long
as
it
is
in
my
power
i
mean
what
can
i
want
of
anything
but
for
you
for
you
and
them
after
this
herbert
sat
silent
for
a
while
leaning
on
his
arm
he
knew
that
there
existed
some
mischief
but
he
could
not
fathom
it
had
he
been
prudent
he
would
have
felt
that
there
was
some
impediment
to
his
love
some
evil
which
it
behoved
him
to
fathom
before
he
allowed
his
love
to
share
it
but
when
was
a
lover
prudent
we
should
live
here
should
we
not
father
no
second
establishment
would
be
necessary
of
course
you
would
live
here
said
sir
thomas
glad
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
subject
on
any
side
that
was
not
painful
of
course
you
would
live
here
for
the
matter
of
that
herbert
the
house
should
be
considered
as
your
own
if
you
so
wished
it
against
this
the
son
put
in
his
most
violent
protest
nothing
on
earth
should
make
him
consider
himself
master
of
castle
richmond
as
long
as
his
father
lived
nor
would
clara
his
clara
wish
it
he
knew
her
well
he
boasted
it
would
amply
suffice
to
her
to
live
there
with
them
all
was
not
the
house
large
enough
and
indeed
where
else
could
he
live
seeing
that
all
his
interests
were
naturally
centred
upon
the
property
and
then
sir
thomas
did
give
his
consent
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
it
was
wrung
from
him
he
gave
it
willingly
enough
as
far
as
the
present
moment
was
concerned
when
it
was
once
settled
he
assured
his
son
that
he
would
love
clara
as
his
daughter
but
nevertheless
the
father
knew
that
he
had
done
wrong
and
herbert
knew
that
he
also
he
himself
had
done
wrongly
he
was
aware
that
there
was
something
which
he
did
not
understand
but
he
had
promised
to
see
clara
either
that
day
or
the
next
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
unsay
all
that
he
had
said
to
her
he
left
his
father
room
sorrowful
at
heart
and
discontented
he
had
expected
that
his
tidings
would
have
been
received
in
so
far
other
a
manner
that
he
would
have
been
able
to
go
from
his
father
study
up
stairs
to
his
mother
room
with
so
exulting
a
step
that
his
news
when
once
the
matter
was
ratified
by
his
father
approval
would
have
flown
about
the
house
with
so
loud
a
note
of
triumph
and
now
it
was
so
different
his
father
had
consented
but
it
was
too
plain
that
there
was
no
room
for
any
triumph
well
herbert
said
emmeline
jumping
up
to
meet
him
as
he
returned
to
a
small
back
through
which
he
had
gone
to
his
father
she
had
calculated
that
he
would
come
there
and
that
she
might
thus
get
the
first
word
from
him
after
the
interview
was
over
but
there
was
a
frown
upon
his
brow
and
displeasure
in
his
eyes
there
was
none
of
that
bright
smile
of
gratified
pride
with
which
she
had
expected
that
her
greeting
would
have
been
met
is
there
anything
wrong
she
said
he
does
not
disapprove
does
he
never
mind
and
do
leave
me
now
i
never
can
make
you
understand
that
one
is
not
always
in
a
humour
for
joking
and
so
saying
he
put
her
aside
and
passed
on
joking
that
was
indeed
hard
upon
poor
emmeline
seeing
that
her
thoughts
were
so
full
of
him
that
her
heart
beat
so
warmly
for
his
promised
bride
but
she
said
nothing
shrinking
back
abashed
and
vanishing
out
of
the
way
could
it
be
possible
that
her
father
should
have
refused
to
receive
lady
clara
desmond
as
his
he
then
betook
himself
to
a
private
territory
of
his
own
where
he
might
be
sure
that
he
would
remain
undisturbed
for
some
or
so
he
would
go
to
his
mother
of
course
but
not
quite
immediately
he
would
think
over
the
matter
endeavouring
to
ascertain
what
it
was
that
had
made
his
father
manner
and
words
so
painful
to
him
but
he
could
not
get
his
thoughts
to
work
rightly
which
getting
of
the
thoughts
to
work
rightly
is
as
i
take
it
the
hardest
work
which
a
man
is
called
upon
to
do
not
that
the
subject
to
be
thought
about
need
in
itself
be
difficult
were
one
to
say
that
thoughts
about
hydrostatics
and
pneumatics
are
difficult
to
the
multitude
or
that
mental
efforts
in
regions
of
political
economy
or
ethical
philosophy
are
beyond
ordinary
reach
one
would
only
pronounce
an
evident
truism
an
absurd
platitude
but
let
any
man
take
any
subject
fully
within
his
own
mind
scope
and
strive
to
think
about
it
steadily
with
some
attempt
at
calculation
as
to
results
the
chances
are
his
mind
will
fly
off
to
some
utterly
different
matter
when
he
wishes
to
debate
within
himself
that
question
of
his
wife
temper
he
will
find
himself
considering
whether
he
may
not
judiciously
give
away
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
those
old
boots
or
when
it
behoves
him
to
decide
whether
it
shall
be
manure
and
a
green
crop
or
a
fallow
season
and
then
grass
seeds
he
can
not
keep
himself
from
inward
inquiry
as
to
the
meaning
of
that
peculiar
smile
on
walker
face
when
he
shook
hands
with
her
last
night
lord
brougham
and
professor
faraday
can
no
doubt
command
their
thoughts
if
many
men
could
do
so
there
would
be
many
lord
broughams
and
many
professor
faradays
at
the
present
moment
herbert
fitzgerald
had
no
right
to
consider
himself
as
following
in
the
steps
of
either
one
or
other
of
these
great
men
he
wished
to
think
about
his
father
circumstances
but
his
mind
would
fly
off
to
clara
desmond
and
her
perfections
and
thus
though
he
remained
there
for
half
an
hour
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
deliberations
had
done
him
no
good
whatever
had
rather
done
him
harm
seeing
that
he
had
only
warmed
himself
into
a
firmer
determination
to
go
on
with
what
he
was
doing
and
then
he
went
to
his
mother
she
kissed
him
and
spoke
very
tenderly
nay
affectionately
about
clara
but
even
she
even
his
mother
did
not
speak
joyously
and
she
also
said
something
about
the
difficulty
of
providing
a
maintenance
for
a
married
son
then
to
her
he
burst
forth
and
spoke
somewhat
loudly
i
can
not
understand
all
this
mother
if
either
you
or
my
father
know
any
reason
why
i
should
be
treated
differently
from
other
sons
you
ought
to
tell
me
not
leave
me
to
grope
about
in
the
dark
but
my
boy
we
both
think
that
no
son
was
ever
entitled
to
more
consideration
or
to
kinder
or
more
liberal
treatment
why
do
i
hear
all
this
then
about
the
difficulty
of
my
marrying
or
if
i
hear
so
much
why
do
i
not
hear
more
i
know
pretty
well
i
believe
what
is
my
father
income
if
you
do
not
he
would
tell
you
for
the
asking
and
i
know
that
i
must
be
the
heir
to
it
whatever
it
is
not
that
that
feeling
would
make
any
difference
in
my
dealings
with
him
not
the
least
and
under
these
circumstances
i
can
not
conceive
why
he
and
you
should
look
coldly
upon
my
marriage
i
look
coldly
on
it
herbert
do
you
not
do
you
not
tell
me
that
there
will
be
no
income
for
me
if
that
is
to
be
so
if
that
really
is
the
case
if
the
property
has
so
dwindled
away
or
become
embarrassed
oh
herbert
there
never
was
a
man
less
likely
to
injure
his
property
than
your
father
i
do
not
mean
that
mother
let
him
do
what
he
likes
with
it
i
should
not
upbraid
him
even
in
my
thoughts
but
if
it
be
embarrassed
if
it
has
dwindled
away
if
there
be
any
reason
why
i
should
not
regard
myself
as
altogether
untrammelled
with
regard
to
money
he
ought
to
tell
me
i
can
not
accuse
myself
of
expensive
tastes
dearest
herbert
nobody
accuses
you
of
anything
but
i
do
desire
to
marry
and
now
i
have
engaged
myself
and
will
not
break
from
my
engagement
unless
it
be
shown
to
me
that
i
am
bound
in
honour
to
do
so
then
indeed
oh
herbert
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
i
mean
this
that
i
expect
that
clara
shall
be
received
as
my
wife
with
open
arms
and
so
she
shall
be
if
she
comes
or
else
that
some
reason
should
be
given
me
why
she
should
not
come
as
to
income
something
must
be
done
i
suppose
if
the
means
at
our
disposal
are
less
than
i
have
been
taught
to
believe
i
at
any
rate
will
not
complain
but
they
can
not
i
think
be
so
small
as
to
afford
any
just
reason
why
i
should
not
marry
your
father
you
see
is
ill
and
one
can
hardly
talk
to
him
fully
upon
such
matters
at
present
then
i
will
speak
to
somers
he
at
any
rate
must
know
how
the
property
is
circumstanced
and
i
suppose
he
will
not
hesitate
to
tell
me
i
do
think
somers
can
tell
you
anything
then
what
is
it
as
for
the
london
estate
mother
that
is
all
moonshine
what
if
it
were
gone
altogether
it
may
be
that
it
is
that
which
vexes
my
father
but
if
so
it
is
a
monomania
oh
my
boy
do
not
use
such
a
word
you
know
what
i
mean
if
any
doubt
as
to
that
is
creating
this
despondency
it
only
shows
that
though
we
are
bound
to
respect
and
relieve
my
father
state
of
mind
we
are
not
at
all
bound
to
share
it
what
would
it
really
matter
mother
if
that
place
in
london
were
washed
away
by
the
thames
there
is
more
than
enough
left
for
us
all
unless
ah
herbert
that
is
it
then
i
will
go
to
somers
and
he
shall
tell
me
my
father
interest
in
this
property
can
not
have
been
involved
without
his
knowledge
and
circumstanced
as
we
and
my
father
are
he
is
bound
to
tell
me
if
there
be
anything
within
his
knowledge
to
tell
he
will
tell
it
and
if
there
be
nothing
within
his
knowledge
then
i
can
only
look
upon
all
this
as
a
disease
on
my
poor
father
part
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
comfort
him
in
it
but
it
would
be
madness
to
destroy
my
whole
happiness
because
he
labours
under
delusions
lady
fitzgerald
did
not
know
what
further
to
say
she
half
believed
that
sir
thomas
did
labour
under
some
delusion
but
then
she
half
believed
also
that
he
had
upon
his
mind
a
sorrow
terribly
real
which
was
in
no
sort
delusive
under
such
circumstances
how
could
she
advise
her
son
instead
of
advising
him
she
caressed
him
but
i
may
claim
this
from
you
mother
that
if
somers
tells
me
nothing
which
ought
to
make
me
break
my
word
to
clara
you
will
receive
her
as
your
daughter
you
will
promise
me
that
will
you
not
lady
fitzgerald
did
promise
warmly
assuring
him
that
she
already
dearly
loved
clara
desmond
that
she
would
delight
in
having
such
a
and
that
she
would
go
to
her
to
welcome
her
as
such
as
soon
as
ever
he
should
bid
her
do
so
with
this
herbert
was
somewhat
comforted
and
immediately
started
on
his
search
after
somers
i
do
not
think
that
any
person
is
to
be
found
as
a
rule
attached
to
english
estates
whose
position
is
analogous
to
that
of
an
irish
agent
and
there
is
a
wide
misunderstanding
in
england
as
to
these
irish
functionaries
i
have
attempted
some
pages
back
to
describe
the
national
delinquencies
of
a
middleman
or
in
england
we
are
apt
to
think
that
the
agents
on
irish
properties
are
to
be
charged
with
similar
shortcomings
this
i
can
assert
to
be
a
great
mistake
and
i
believe
that
as
a
class
the
agents
on
irish
properties
do
their
duty
in
a
manner
beneficial
to
the
people
that
there
are
or
were
many
agents
who
were
also
middlemen
or
and
that
in
this
second
position
they
were
a
nuisance
to
the
country
is
no
doubt
true
but
they
were
no
nuisance
in
their
working
capacity
as
agents
that
there
are
some
bad
agents
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
there
are
also
some
bad
shoemakers
the
duties
towards
an
estate
which
an
agent
performs
in
ireland
are
i
believe
generally
shared
in
england
between
three
or
four
different
persons
the
family
lawyer
performs
part
the
estate
steward
performs
part
and
the
landlord
himself
performs
part
as
to
small
estates
by
far
the
greater
part
in
ireland
let
the
estate
be
ever
so
small
eight
hundred
a
year
we
will
say
all
the
working
of
the
property
is
managed
by
the
agent
it
is
he
who
knows
the
tenants
and
the
limits
of
their
holdings
it
is
he
who
arranges
leases
and
allows
or
much
more
generally
does
not
allow
for
improvements
he
takes
the
rent
and
gives
the
order
for
the
ejection
of
tenants
if
he
can
not
get
it
i
am
far
from
saying
that
it
would
not
be
well
that
much
of
this
should
be
done
by
the
landlord
himself
that
all
of
it
should
be
so
done
on
a
small
property
but
it
is
done
by
agents
and
as
a
rule
is
i
think
done
honestly
somers
was
agent
to
the
castle
richmond
property
and
as
he
took
to
himself
as
such
five
per
cent
on
all
rents
paid
and
as
he
was
agent
also
to
sundry
other
small
properties
in
the
neighbourhood
he
succeeded
in
making
a
very
snug
income
he
had
also
an
excellent
house
on
the
estate
and
was
altogether
very
much
thought
of
on
the
whole
perhaps
more
than
was
sir
thomas
but
in
this
respect
it
was
probable
that
herbert
might
soon
take
the
lead
he
was
a
large
heavy
consequential
man
always
very
busy
as
though
aware
of
being
one
of
the
most
important
wheels
that
kept
the
irish
clock
agoing
but
he
was
honest
in
the
main
true
as
steel
to
his
employers
and
as
long
as
he
was
allowed
to
have
his
own
way
in
these
latter
days
he
had
been
a
little
soured
by
herbert
interference
and
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
in
his
humble
judgment
fitzgerald
was
wrong
in
doing
so
and
so
but
he
generally
called
him
herbert
was
always
kind
to
him
and
in
his
heart
of
hearts
loved
him
dearly
but
that
was
a
matter
of
course
for
had
he
not
been
agent
to
the
estate
before
herbert
was
born
immediately
after
his
interview
with
his
mother
herbert
rode
over
to
somers
house
and
there
found
him
sitting
alone
in
his
office
he
dashed
immediately
into
the
subject
that
had
brought
him
there
i
have
come
somers
said
he
to
ask
you
a
question
about
the
property
about
the
castle
richmond
property
said
somers
rather
surprised
by
his
visitor
manner
yes
you
know
in
what
a
state
my
poor
father
now
is
i
know
that
sir
thomas
is
not
very
well
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
it
is
long
since
he
has
been
quite
himself
there
is
something
that
is
preying
upon
his
spirits
i
am
afraid
so
herbert
then
tell
me
fairly
somers
do
you
know
what
it
is
not
in
the
least
i
have
no
conception
whatever
and
never
have
had
any
i
know
no
cause
for
trouble
that
should
disquiet
him
there
is
nothing
wrong
about
the
property
not
to
my
knowledge
who
has
the
they
are
at
coutts
you
are
sure
of
that
well
as
sure
as
a
man
can
be
of
a
thing
that
he
does
not
see
i
have
never
seen
them
there
indeed
have
never
seen
them
at
all
but
i
feel
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind
as
to
their
being
at
the
bankers
is
there
much
due
on
the
estate
very
little
no
estate
in
county
cork
has
less
on
it
miss
letty
has
her
income
and
when
poulnasherry
was
bought
that
townland
lying
just
under
berryhill
where
the
gorse
cover
is
part
of
the
purchase
money
was
left
on
mortgage
that
is
still
due
but
the
interest
is
less
than
a
hundred
a
year
and
that
is
all
all
that
i
know
of
could
there
be
encumbrances
without
your
knowing
it
i
think
not
i
think
it
is
impossible
of
all
men
your
father
is
the
last
to
encumber
his
estates
in
a
manner
unknown
to
his
agent
and
to
pay
off
the
interest
in
secret
what
is
it
then
mr
somers
i
do
not
know
and
then
somers
paused
of
course
you
have
heard
of
a
visit
he
received
the
other
day
from
a
stranger
yes
i
heard
of
it
people
about
here
are
talking
of
it
and
he
that
man
with
a
younger
man
they
are
still
living
in
cork
at
a
little
in
south
main
street
the
younger
man
has
been
seen
down
here
twice
but
what
can
that
mean
i
do
not
know
i
tell
you
everything
that
i
do
know
herbert
exacted
a
promise
from
him
that
he
would
continue
to
tell
him
everything
which
he
might
learn
and
then
rode
back
to
castle
richmond
the
whole
thing
must
be
a
delusion
he
said
to
himself
and
resolved
that
there
was
no
valid
reason
why
he
should
make
clara
unhappy
by
any
reference
to
the
circumstance
chapter
xiii
mollett
returns
to
south
main
street
i
must
now
take
my
readers
back
to
that
very
unsavoury
in
south
main
street
cork
in
which
for
the
present
lived
matthew
mollett
and
his
son
abraham
i
need
hardly
explain
to
a
discerning
public
that
matthew
mollett
was
the
gentleman
who
made
that
momentous
call
at
castle
richmond
and
flurried
all
that
household
drat
it
said
jones
to
herself
on
that
day
as
soon
as
she
had
regained
the
solitude
of
her
own
private
apartment
after
having
taken
a
long
look
at
mollett
in
the
hall
on
that
occasion
she
sat
down
on
a
low
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
room
put
her
two
hands
down
substantially
on
her
two
knees
gave
a
long
sigh
and
then
made
the
above
exclamation
drat
it
jones
was
still
thoroughly
a
saxon
although
she
had
lived
for
so
many
years
among
the
celts
but
it
was
only
when
she
was
quite
alone
that
she
allowed
herself
the
indulgence
of
so
peculiarly
saxon
a
mode
of
expressing
either
her
surprise
or
indignation
it
the
same
man
she
said
to
herself
as
come
that
day
as
sure
as
eggs
and
then
for
five
minutes
she
maintained
her
position
cogitating
and
he
like
the
other
fellow
too
she
continued
only
somehow
he
not
like
him
and
then
another
pause
and
yet
he
is
only
it
ca
be
and
he
ai
just
so
tall
and
he
older
like
and
then
still
meditating
jones
kept
her
position
for
full
ten
minutes
longer
at
the
end
of
which
time
she
got
up
and
shook
herself
she
deserved
to
be
bracketed
with
lord
brougham
and
professor
faraday
for
she
had
kept
her
mind
intent
on
her
subject
and
had
come
to
a
resolution
i
wo
say
nothing
to
nobody
noways
was
the
expression
of
her
mind
purpose
only
i
tell
missus
as
how
he
was
the
man
as
come
to
wales
and
she
did
tell
so
much
to
her
mistress
as
we
have
before
learned
mollett
had
gone
down
from
cork
to
castle
richmond
in
one
of
those
delightful
irish
vehicles
called
a
covered
car
an
car
is
an
equipage
much
given
to
shaking
seeing
that
it
has
a
heavy
top
like
a
london
cab
and
that
it
runs
on
a
pair
of
wheels
it
is
entered
from
behind
and
slopes
backwards
the
sitter
sits
sideways
between
a
cracked
window
on
one
side
and
a
cracked
doorway
on
the
other
and
as
a
draught
is
always
going
in
at
the
ear
next
the
window
and
out
at
the
ear
next
the
door
it
is
about
as
cold
and
comfortless
a
vehicle
for
winter
as
may
be
well
imagined
now
the
journey
from
castle
richmond
to
cork
has
to
be
made
right
across
the
boggeragh
mountains
it
is
over
twenty
miles
irish
and
the
road
is
never
very
good
mollett
therefore
was
five
hours
in
the
covered
car
on
his
return
journey
and
as
he
had
stopped
for
lunch
at
kanturk
and
had
not
hurried
himself
at
that
meal
it
was
very
dark
and
very
cold
when
he
reached
the
house
in
south
main
street
i
think
i
have
explained
that
mollett
senior
was
not
absolutely
a
drunkard
but
nevertheless
he
was
not
averse
to
spirits
in
cold
weather
and
on
this
journey
had
warmed
himself
with
whisky
once
or
twice
on
the
road
he
had
found
a
shebeen
house
when
he
crossed
the
nad
river
and
another
on
the
and
a
third
at
the
point
where
the
road
passes
near
the
village
of
blarney
and
at
all
these
convenient
mollett
had
endeavoured
to
warm
himself
there
are
men
who
do
not
become
absolutely
drunk
but
who
do
become
absolutely
cross
when
they
drink
more
than
is
good
for
them
and
of
such
men
mollett
was
one
what
with
the
cold
air
and
what
with
the
whisky
and
what
with
the
jolting
mollett
was
very
cross
when
he
reached
the
kanturk
hotel
so
that
he
only
cursed
the
driver
instead
of
giving
him
the
expected
gratuity
i
come
to
yer
honour
in
the
morning
said
the
driver
you
may
go
to
the
devil
in
the
morning
answered
mollett
and
this
was
the
first
intimation
of
his
return
which
reached
the
ears
of
his
expectant
son
there
the
governor
said
aby
who
was
then
flirting
with
miss
in
the
bar
somebody
been
stroking
him
the
wrong
way
of
the
the
charms
of
miss
in
these
idle
days
had
been
too
much
for
the
prudence
of
abraham
mollett
by
far
too
much
considering
that
in
his
sterner
moments
his
ambition
led
him
to
contemplate
a
match
with
a
young
lady
of
much
higher
rank
in
life
but
wine
which
inspires
us
and
fires
us
with
courage
love
and
joy
had
inspired
him
with
courage
to
forget
his
prudence
and
with
love
for
the
lovely
fanny
now
nonsense
aby
she
had
said
to
him
a
few
minutes
before
the
wheels
of
the
covered
car
were
heard
in
south
main
street
you
know
you
main
nothing
of
the
sort
by
fanny
i
mean
every
word
of
it
may
this
drop
be
my
poison
if
i
do
this
piece
of
business
here
keeps
me
and
the
governor
hon
and
hoff
like
and
will
do
for
some
weeks
perhaps
but
when
that
done
honly
say
the
word
and
i
make
you
that
fair
now
but
aby
never
mind
the
mister
fan
between
friends
la
i
could
call
you
aby
without
it
could
i
try
my
darling
well
aby
there
now
it
does
sound
so
uppish
do
it
but
tell
me
this
now
what
is
the
business
that
you
and
the
old
gentleman
is
about
down
at
kanturk
abraham
mollett
hereupon
had
put
one
finger
to
his
nose
and
then
winked
his
eye
if
you
care
about
me
as
you
say
you
do
you
would
be
shy
of
just
telling
me
as
much
as
that
that
business
fan
and
business
and
love
do
hamalgamate
like
whisky
and
sugar
then
i
tell
you
what
it
is
aby
i
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
a
man
who
wo
show
his
rispect
by
telling
me
his
sacrets
that
it
is
it
fan
i
suppose
you
think
i
ca
keep
a
sacret
you
think
i
be
telling
father
i
suppose
well
it
about
some
money
that
due
to
him
down
there
who
from
he
expects
to
get
it
from
some
of
those
fitzgerald
people
in
saying
so
much
mollett
the
younger
had
not
utterly
abandoned
all
prudence
he
knew
very
well
that
the
and
others
would
be
aware
that
his
father
had
been
to
castle
richmond
and
that
it
was
more
than
probable
that
either
he
or
his
father
would
have
to
make
further
visits
there
indeed
he
had
almost
determined
that
he
would
go
down
to
the
baronet
himself
under
these
circumstances
it
might
be
well
that
some
pretext
for
these
visits
should
be
given
which
fitzgerald
aby
is
it
the
hap
house
young
man
hap
house
i
never
heard
of
such
a
place
these
people
live
at
castle
richmond
oh
h
h
if
mollett
have
money
due
there
sure
he
have
a
good
mark
to
go
upon
why
sir
thomas
is
about
the
richest
man
in
these
parts
and
who
is
this
other
man
at
what
is
it
you
call
his
place
hap
house
oh
it
he
is
the
young
gentleman
only
they
say
he
a
leetle
too
fast
to
my
mind
owen
is
the
man
to
be
seen
anywhere
in
the
county
cork
he
a
flame
of
yours
is
he
fan
i
do
know
what
you
main
by
a
flame
but
there
not
a
girl
in
cork
but
what
likes
the
glance
of
his
eye
they
do
say
that
he
have
lady
clara
desmond
only
there
ai
no
money
and
what
he
to
these
other
people
cousin
i
believe
or
hardly
so
much
as
that
i
thinking
but
all
the
same
if
anything
was
to
happen
to
young
herbert
it
would
all
go
to
him
it
would
would
it
so
people
say
is
the
son
of
the
old
cock
at
castle
richmond
he
just
so
he
the
young
cock
he
he
he
and
if
he
was
to
be
nowhere
like
not
his
father
son
at
all
for
instance
it
would
all
go
to
this
man
would
it
every
shilling
they
say
house
title
and
all
hum
said
abraham
mollett
and
he
began
again
to
calculate
his
family
chances
perhaps
after
all
this
handsome
young
man
who
was
at
present
too
poor
to
marry
his
noble
lady
love
might
be
the
more
liberal
man
to
deal
with
but
then
any
dealings
with
him
would
kill
the
golden
goose
at
once
all
would
depend
on
the
size
of
the
one
egg
which
might
be
extracted
he
certainly
felt
however
that
this
fitzgerald
family
arrangement
was
one
which
it
was
beneficial
that
he
should
know
but
he
felt
also
that
it
would
be
by
no
means
necessary
at
present
to
communicate
the
information
to
his
father
he
put
it
by
in
his
mind
regarding
it
as
a
fund
on
which
he
might
draw
if
occasion
should
require
it
might
perhaps
be
pleasant
for
him
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
this
young
fitzgerald
of
and
now
fan
my
darling
give
us
a
kiss
said
he
getting
up
from
his
seat
and
i
wo
said
fan
withdrawing
herself
among
the
bottles
and
glasses
and
you
shall
my
love
said
aby
pertinaciously
as
he
prepared
to
follow
her
through
the
brittle
ware
hu
sh
be
aisy
now
there
tom
he
ears
for
everything
and
eyes
like
a
cat
what
do
i
care
for
tom
and
father
be
coming
in
be
aisy
i
tell
you
i
wo
now
aby
and
that
enough
you
break
the
bottle
d
the
bottle
that
smashed
hany
way
come
fan
what
a
kiss
among
friends
cock
you
up
with
kisses
indeed
how
bad
you
are
for
dainties
there
do
you
hear
that
that
the
old
gentleman
and
then
as
the
voice
of
mollett
senior
was
heard
abusing
the
miss
smoothed
her
apron
put
her
hands
to
her
side
hair
and
removed
the
debris
of
the
broken
bottle
well
governor
said
aby
how
goes
it
how
goes
it
indeed
it
goes
pretty
well
i
dare
say
in
here
where
you
can
sit
drinking
toddy
all
the
evening
and
doing
nothing
why
what
on
hearth
would
you
have
me
be
doing
better
here
than
paddling
about
in
the
streets
is
it
if
you
could
do
a
stroke
of
work
now
and
then
to
earn
your
bread
it
might
be
better
now
aby
knew
from
experience
that
whenever
his
father
talked
to
him
about
earning
his
bread
he
was
half
drunk
and
whole
cross
so
he
made
no
immediate
reply
on
that
point
you
are
cold
i
suppose
governor
and
had
better
get
a
bit
of
something
to
eat
and
a
little
tea
and
put
my
feet
in
hot
water
and
tallow
my
nose
and
go
to
bed
had
i
miss
i
trouble
you
to
mix
me
a
glass
of
of
all
the
roads
i
ever
travelled
that
the
longest
and
hardest
to
get
over
dashed
if
i
did
begin
to
think
i
never
be
here
and
so
saying
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
and
put
up
his
feet
on
the
two
hobs
there
was
a
kettle
on
one
of
them
which
the
young
lady
pushed
a
little
nearer
to
the
hot
coals
in
order
to
show
that
the
water
should
be
boiling
and
as
she
did
so
aby
gave
her
a
wink
over
his
father
shoulder
by
way
of
conveying
to
her
an
intimation
that
the
governor
was
a
little
cut
or
in
other
language
tipsy
and
that
the
should
be
brewed
with
a
discreet
view
to
past
events
of
the
same
description
all
which
miss
perfectly
understood
it
may
easily
be
conceived
that
aby
was
especially
anxious
to
receive
tidings
of
what
had
been
done
this
day
down
in
the
kanturk
neighbourhood
he
had
given
his
views
to
his
father
as
will
be
remembered
and
though
mollett
senior
had
not
professed
himself
as
absolutely
agreeing
with
them
he
had
nevertheless
owned
that
he
was
imbued
with
the
necessity
of
taking
some
great
step
he
had
gone
down
to
take
this
great
step
and
aby
was
very
anxious
to
know
how
it
had
been
taken
when
the
father
and
son
were
both
sober
or
when
the
son
was
tipsy
or
when
the
father
was
absolutely
drunk
an
accident
which
would
occur
occasionally
the
spirit
and
pluck
of
the
son
was
in
the
ascendant
he
at
such
times
was
the
more
masterful
of
the
two
and
generally
contrived
either
by
persuasion
or
bullying
to
govern
his
governor
but
when
it
did
happen
that
mollett
p√®re
was
half
drunk
and
cross
with
drink
then
at
such
moments
mollett
fils
had
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
his
governor
was
not
to
be
governed
and
indeed
at
such
moments
his
governor
could
be
very
disagreeable
could
say
nasty
bitter
things
showing
very
little
parental
affection
and
make
himself
altogether
bad
society
not
only
to
his
son
but
to
his
son
companions
also
now
it
appeared
to
aby
that
his
father
was
at
present
in
this
condition
he
had
only
to
egg
him
on
to
further
drinking
and
the
respectable
gentleman
would
become
stupid
noisy
soft
and
affectionate
but
then
when
in
that
state
he
would
blab
terribly
it
was
much
with
the
view
of
keeping
him
from
that
state
that
under
the
present
circumstances
the
son
remained
with
the
father
to
do
the
father
justice
it
may
be
asserted
that
he
knew
his
own
weakness
and
that
knowing
it
he
had
abstained
from
heavy
drinking
since
he
had
taken
in
hand
this
great
piece
of
diplomacy
but
you
must
be
hungry
governor
wo
you
take
a
bit
of
something
shall
we
get
you
a
steek
mr
mollett
asked
miss
hospitably
or
just
a
bit
of
bacon
with
a
couple
of
eggs
or
so
it
would
be
a
minute
you
know
your
eggs
are
all
addled
and
bad
said
mollett
and
as
for
a
it
my
belief
there
is
such
a
thing
in
all
ireland
after
which
civil
speech
miss
winked
at
aby
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
what
a
state
he
in
have
a
bit
of
buttered
toast
and
a
cup
of
tea
governor
suggested
the
son
i
d
if
i
do
replied
the
father
you
become
uncommon
fond
of
tea
of
late
that
is
for
other
people
i
do
see
you
take
much
of
it
yourself
a
cup
of
tay
is
the
thing
to
warm
one
afther
such
a
journey
as
you
had
that
certain
mollett
said
fanny
them
your
ideas
about
warming
are
they
my
dear
said
the
elderly
gentleman
do
you
come
and
sit
down
on
my
knee
here
for
a
few
minutes
or
so
and
that
warm
me
better
than
all
the
in
the
world
aby
showed
by
his
face
that
he
was
immeasurably
disgusted
by
the
iniquitous
coarseness
of
this
overture
miss
however
looking
at
the
gentleman
age
and
his
state
as
regarded
liquor
passed
it
over
as
of
no
moment
whatsoever
so
that
when
in
the
later
part
of
the
evening
aby
expressed
to
that
young
lady
his
deep
disgust
she
merely
said
oh
bother
what
matters
an
old
man
like
that
and
then
when
they
were
at
this
pass
came
in
he
did
not
interfere
much
with
his
daughter
in
the
bar
room
but
he
would
occasionally
take
a
dandy
of
punch
there
and
ask
how
things
were
going
on
in
doors
he
was
a
fat
thickset
man
with
a
face
a
flattened
nose
and
a
great
aptitude
for
stable
occupations
he
was
part
owner
of
the
kanturk
car
as
has
been
before
said
and
was
the
proprietor
of
sundry
other
cars
open
cars
and
covered
cars
plying
for
hire
in
the
streets
of
cork
i
hope
the
mare
took
your
honour
well
down
to
kanturk
and
back
again
said
he
addressing
his
elder
customer
with
a
chuck
of
his
head
intended
for
a
bow
i
do
know
what
you
call
well
said
mollett
she
had
a
leg
to
stand
upon
for
the
last
three
hours
not
a
leg
to
stand
upon
faix
then
and
it
she
have
the
four
good
legs
if
she
travelled
every
inch
of
the
way
from
to
to
which
distance
specially
referred
as
being
supposed
to
be
the
longest
known
in
ireland
she
may
be
able
to
do
that
but
i
blessed
if
she
fit
to
go
to
kanturk
and
back
she
done
the
work
anyhow
said
who
evidently
thought
that
this
last
argument
was
conclusive
and
a
precious
time
she
been
about
it
why
my
goodness
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
to
have
walked
it
as
sir
thomas
said
to
me
what
did
you
see
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
hereupon
aby
gave
his
father
a
nudge
but
the
father
either
did
not
appreciate
the
nudge
or
did
not
choose
to
obey
it
yes
i
did
see
him
why
should
i
only
they
do
say
he
hard
to
get
to
speak
to
he
not
over
well
you
know
these
years
back
well
or
ill
he
see
me
i
take
it
when
i
go
that
distance
to
ask
him
there
no
doubt
about
that
is
there
aby
ca
say
i
sure
not
knowing
the
gentleman
said
aby
we
holds
land
from
sir
thomas
we
do
that
is
me
and
my
brother
mick
and
a
better
landlord
ai
nowhere
said
oh
you
one
of
the
tenants
are
you
the
rents
are
paid
pretty
well
ai
they
to
the
day
said
proudly
what
would
you
think
now
mollett
was
continuing
but
aby
interrupted
him
somewhat
violently
hold
your
confounded
stupid
tongue
will
you
you
old
jolterhead
and
on
this
occasion
he
put
his
hand
on
his
father
shoulder
and
shook
him
who
are
you
calling
jolterhead
who
do
you
dare
to
speak
to
in
that
way
you
impudent
young
cub
you
am
i
to
ask
your
leave
when
i
want
to
open
my
mouth
aby
had
well
known
that
his
father
in
his
present
mood
would
not
stand
the
manner
in
which
the
interruption
was
attempted
nor
did
he
wish
to
quarrel
before
the
publican
and
his
daughter
but
anything
was
better
than
allowing
his
father
to
continue
in
the
strain
in
which
he
was
talking
you
are
talking
of
things
which
you
do
hunderstand
and
about
people
you
do
know
said
aby
you
had
a
drop
too
much
on
the
road
too
and
you
better
go
to
bed
old
mollett
turned
round
to
strike
at
his
son
but
even
in
his
present
state
he
was
somewhat
quelled
by
aby
eye
aby
was
keenly
alive
to
the
necessity
for
prudence
on
his
father
part
though
he
was
by
no
means
able
to
be
prudent
himself
talking
of
things
which
i
do
understand
am
i
said
the
old
man
that
all
you
know
about
it
give
me
another
glass
of
that
brandy
toddy
my
dear
but
aby
look
had
quelled
or
at
any
rate
silenced
him
and
though
he
did
advance
another
stage
in
tipsiness
before
they
succeeded
in
getting
him
off
to
bed
he
said
no
more
about
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
or
his
castle
richmond
secrets
nevertheless
he
had
said
enough
to
cause
suspicion
one
would
not
have
imagined
on
looking
at
that
he
was
a
very
crafty
person
or
one
of
whose
finesse
in
affairs
of
the
world
it
would
be
necessary
to
stand
much
in
awe
he
seemed
to
be
thick
and
stolid
and
incapable
of
deep
inquiry
but
nevertheless
he
was
as
fond
of
his
neighbours
affairs
as
another
and
knew
as
much
about
the
affairs
of
his
neighbours
at
kanturk
as
any
man
in
the
county
cork
he
himself
was
a
kanturk
man
and
his
wife
had
been
a
kanturk
woman
no
less
a
person
indeed
than
the
sister
of
father
bernard
rest
her
soul
for
it
was
now
at
peace
let
us
all
hope
she
had
been
dead
these
ten
years
but
he
did
not
the
less
keep
up
his
connection
with
the
old
town
or
with
his
the
priest
or
with
the
affairs
of
the
persons
there
adjacent
especially
we
may
say
those
of
his
landlord
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
under
whom
he
still
held
a
small
farm
in
conjunction
with
his
brother
mick
the
publican
at
kanturk
what
all
that
about
sir
thomas
said
he
to
his
daughter
in
a
low
voice
as
soon
as
the
molletts
had
left
the
bar
well
i
do
just
know
said
fanny
she
was
a
good
daughter
and
loved
her
father
whose
indoor
affairs
she
kept
tight
enough
for
him
but
she
had
hardly
made
up
her
mind
as
yet
whether
or
no
it
would
suit
her
to
be
abraham
mollett
should
such
be
her
destiny
it
might
be
as
well
for
her
not
to
talk
about
her
husband
matters
is
it
true
that
the
old
man
did
see
sir
thomas
you
heard
what
passed
father
but
i
suppose
it
is
true
and
the
young
has
been
down
to
kanturk
two
or
three
times
what
can
the
like
of
them
have
to
do
with
sir
thomas
to
this
fanny
could
only
say
that
she
knew
nothing
about
it
which
in
the
main
was
true
aby
indeed
had
said
that
his
father
had
gone
down
to
collect
money
that
was
due
to
him
but
then
fanny
did
not
believe
all
that
aby
said
i
do
like
that
young
at
all
continued
he
a
nasty
sneaking
fellow
as
cares
for
no
one
but
his
own
belly
not
over
fond
of
the
old
neither
they
is
both
free
enough
with
their
money
father
said
the
prudent
daughter
oh
they
is
welcome
in
the
way
of
business
in
course
but
look
here
fan
do
you
have
nothing
to
say
to
that
aby
do
you
hear
me
who
i
ha
ha
ha
it
all
very
well
laughing
but
mind
what
i
says
for
i
wo
have
it
he
is
a
nasty
sneaking
fellow
besides
being
a
heretic
what
your
uncle
bernard
say
oh
for
the
matter
of
that
if
i
took
a
liking
to
a
fellow
i
should
ask
uncle
bernard
what
he
had
to
say
if
he
did
like
it
i
suppose
he
might
do
the
other
thing
well
i
wo
have
it
do
you
hear
that
laws
father
what
nonsense
you
do
talk
who
thinking
about
the
man
he
comes
here
for
what
he
wants
to
ate
and
dhrink
and
i
suppose
the
house
is
free
to
him
as
another
if
not
we
betther
just
shut
up
the
front
door
after
which
she
tossed
herself
up
and
began
to
wipe
her
glasses
in
a
rather
dignified
manner
sat
smoking
his
pipe
and
chewing
the
cud
of
his
reflections
they
ai
afther
no
good
i
sure
of
that
in
saying
which
however
he
referred
to
the
doings
of
the
molletts
down
at
kanturk
rather
than
to
any
amatory
proceedings
which
might
have
taken
place
between
the
young
man
and
his
daughter
on
the
following
morning
mollett
senior
awoke
with
a
racking
headache
my
belief
is
that
when
men
pay
this
penalty
for
drinking
they
are
partly
absolved
from
other
penalties
the
penalties
on
drink
are
various
i
mean
those
which
affect
the
body
exclusive
of
those
which
affect
the
mind
there
are
great
red
swollen
noses
very
disagreeable
both
to
the
wearer
and
his
acquaintances
there
are
morning
headaches
awful
to
be
thought
of
there
are
sick
stomachs
by
which
means
the
offender
escapes
through
a
speedy
purgatory
there
are
sallow
cheeks
sunken
eyes
and
shaking
shoulders
there
are
very
big
bellies
and
no
bellies
at
all
and
there
is
delirium
tremens
for
the
most
part
a
man
escapes
with
one
of
these
penalties
if
he
have
a
racking
headache
his
general
health
does
not
usually
suffer
so
much
as
though
he
had
endured
no
such
immediate
vengeance
from
violated
nature
young
aby
when
he
drank
had
no
headaches
but
his
eye
was
bloodshot
his
cheek
bloated
and
his
hand
shook
his
father
on
the
other
hand
could
not
raise
his
head
after
a
debauch
but
when
that
was
gone
all
ill
results
of
his
imprudence
seemed
to
have
vanished
at
about
noon
on
that
day
aby
was
sitting
by
his
father
bedside
up
to
that
time
it
had
been
quite
impossible
to
induce
him
to
speak
a
word
he
could
only
groan
swallow
with
hairs
of
the
dog
that
bit
him
in
it
and
lay
with
his
head
between
his
arms
but
soon
after
noon
aby
did
induce
him
to
say
a
word
or
two
the
door
of
the
room
was
closely
shut
the
little
table
was
strewed
with
bottles
and
last
drops
of
small
goes
of
brandy
aby
himself
had
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
on
the
floor
near
the
was
a
plate
with
a
cold
greasy
mutton
chop
aby
having
endeavoured
in
vain
to
induce
his
father
to
fortify
exhausted
nature
by
eating
the
appearance
of
the
room
and
the
air
within
it
would
not
have
been
pleasant
to
fastidious
people
but
then
the
molletts
were
not
fastidious
you
did
see
sir
thomas
then
yes
i
did
see
him
i
wish
aby
you
let
me
lie
just
for
another
hour
or
so
i
be
all
right
then
the
jolting
of
that
confounded
car
has
nearly
shaken
my
head
to
pieces
but
aby
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
be
so
merciful
the
probability
was
that
he
would
be
able
to
pump
his
father
more
thoroughly
in
his
present
weak
state
than
he
might
do
in
a
later
part
of
the
afternoon
so
he
persevered
but
governor
it
so
important
we
should
know
what
we
about
did
you
see
any
one
else
except
himself
i
saw
them
all
i
believe
except
her
i
was
told
she
never
showed
in
the
morning
but
i
blessed
if
i
do
think
i
saw
the
skirt
of
her
dress
through
an
open
door
i
tell
you
what
aby
i
could
not
stand
that
perhaps
father
after
hall
it
be
better
i
should
manage
the
business
down
there
i
believe
there
wo
be
much
more
to
manage
but
aby
do
leave
me
now
there
a
good
fellow
then
in
another
hour
or
so
i
get
up
and
we
have
it
all
out
when
you
out
in
the
open
air
and
comfortable
it
wo
be
fair
to
be
bothering
you
with
business
come
governor
ten
minutes
will
tell
the
whole
of
it
if
you
only
mind
your
eye
how
did
you
begin
with
sir
thomas
and
then
aby
went
to
the
door
opened
it
very
gently
and
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
nobody
listening
on
the
mollett
sighed
wearily
but
he
knew
that
his
only
hope
was
to
get
this
job
of
talking
over
what
was
it
you
were
saying
aby
how
did
you
begin
with
sir
thomas
how
did
i
begin
with
him
let
me
see
oh
i
just
told
him
who
i
was
and
then
he
turned
away
and
looked
down
under
the
fire
like
and
i
thought
he
was
going
to
make
a
faint
of
it
i
did
suppose
he
would
be
very
glad
to
see
you
governor
when
i
saw
how
badly
he
took
it
and
how
wretched
he
seemed
i
almost
made
up
my
mind
to
go
away
and
never
trouble
him
any
more
you
did
did
you
and
just
to
take
what
he
choose
to
give
me
oh
them
your
hideas
hare
they
then
i
tell
you
what
i
shall
just
take
the
matter
into
my
own
hands
hentirely
you
have
no
more
than
a
chicken
ah
that
very
well
aby
but
you
did
not
see
him
do
you
think
that
would
make
hany
difference
when
a
man
a
job
of
work
to
do
should
do
it
them
my
notions
do
you
think
a
man
like
that
is
to
go
and
hact
in
that
way
and
then
not
pay
for
it
whose
wife
is
she
i
like
to
know
there
was
a
tone
of
injured
justice
about
aby
which
almost
roused
the
father
to
participate
in
the
son
indignation
well
i
did
my
best
though
the
old
gentleman
was
in
such
a
taking
said
he
and
what
was
your
best
come
out
with
it
at
once
i
i
just
told
him
who
i
was
you
know
i
guess
he
understood
that
quite
well
and
then
i
said
things
were
going
exactly
well
with
me
you
should
have
said
that
at
all
what
matters
that
to
him
what
you
hask
for
you
hask
for
because
you
able
to
demand
it
the
ground
for
hus
to
take
and
by
i
take
it
too
there
shall
be
no
with
me
and
then
i
told
him
just
what
we
were
agreed
you
know
that
we
go
snacks
in
the
whole
concern
i
did
exactly
say
that
then
what
the
devil
did
you
say
why
i
told
him
that
looking
at
what
the
property
was
twelve
hundred
pounds
was
much
i
should
think
not
either
and
that
if
his
son
was
to
be
allowed
to
have
it
all
a
bastard
you
know
keeping
it
away
from
the
proper
heir
it
may
almost
be
doubted
whether
in
so
speaking
aby
did
not
almost
think
that
he
himself
had
a
legitimate
right
to
inherit
the
property
at
castle
richmond
he
must
look
to
pay
up
handsome
but
did
you
say
what
meant
well
i
did
not
then
he
fell
about
upon
the
table
like
and
i
was
quite
sure
he
would
make
a
die
of
it
and
then
heaven
knows
what
might
have
happened
to
me
psha
you
no
pluck
governor
i
tell
you
what
it
is
aby
i
ai
so
sure
you
have
such
an
uncommon
deal
of
pluck
yourself
well
i
try
at
any
rate
it
is
such
a
pleasant
thing
to
see
an
old
gentleman
in
that
state
and
what
would
happen
if
he
chose
to
ring
the
bell
and
order
the
police
to
take
me
have
you
ever
thought
of
that
gammon
but
it
is
gammon
a
word
from
him
would
put
me
into
quod
and
there
i
should
be
for
the
rest
of
my
days
but
what
would
you
care
for
that
and
poor
mollett
senior
shook
under
the
bedclothes
as
his
attention
became
turned
to
this
very
dreary
aspect
of
his
affairs
pluck
indeed
i
tell
you
what
it
is
aby
i
often
wonder
at
my
own
pluck
psha
would
a
word
from
you
split
upon
him
and
upon
her
and
upon
the
young
and
ruin
or
a
word
from
me
either
for
the
matter
of
that
mollett
senior
shook
again
he
repented
now
as
he
had
already
done
twenty
times
that
he
had
taken
that
son
of
his
into
his
confidence
and
what
on
hearth
did
you
say
to
him
continued
aby
well
not
much
more
then
at
least
not
very
much
more
there
was
a
good
deal
of
words
but
they
did
seem
to
lead
to
much
except
this
just
to
make
him
understand
that
he
must
come
down
handsome
and
there
was
nothing
done
about
hemmiline
no
said
the
father
rather
shortly
if
that
was
settled
that
would
be
the
clincher
there
would
be
no
further
trouble
to
nobody
then
it
would
be
all
smooth
sailing
for
your
life
governor
and
lots
of
tin
i
tell
you
what
it
is
aby
you
may
just
drop
that
for
i
wo
have
the
young
lady
bothered
about
it
nor
yet
the
young
lady
father
you
wo
wo
you
no
i
wo
so
there
an
end
of
it
i
suppose
i
may
pay
my
distresses
to
any
young
lady
if
i
think
fitting
and
have
yourself
kicked
into
the
ditch
i
know
too
much
for
kicking
governor
they
shall
know
as
much
as
you
do
and
more
too
if
you
go
on
with
that
there
a
measure
in
all
things
i
wo
have
it
done
so
i
tell
you
and
the
father
turned
his
face
round
to
the
wall
this
was
by
no
means
the
end
of
the
conversation
though
we
need
not
verbatim
go
through
any
more
of
it
it
appeared
that
old
mollett
had
told
sir
thomas
that
his
permanent
silence
could
be
purchased
by
nothing
short
of
a
settled
genteel
income
for
himself
and
his
son
no
absolute
sum
having
been
mentioned
and
that
sir
thomas
had
required
a
fortnight
for
his
answer
which
answer
was
to
be
conveyed
to
mollett
verbally
at
the
end
of
that
time
it
was
agreed
that
mollett
should
repeat
his
visit
to
castle
richmond
on
that
day
fortnight
in
the
mean
time
i
go
down
and
freshen
the
old
gentleman
up
a
bit
said
aby
as
he
left
his
father
bedroom
chapter
xiv
the
rejected
suitor
after
the
interview
between
herbert
and
his
mother
it
became
an
understood
thing
at
castle
richmond
that
he
was
engaged
to
lady
clara
sir
thomas
raised
no
further
objection
although
it
was
clear
to
all
the
immediate
family
that
he
was
by
no
means
gratified
at
his
son
engagement
very
little
more
passed
between
sir
thomas
and
lady
fitzgerald
on
the
subject
he
merely
said
that
he
would
consider
the
question
of
his
son
income
and
expressed
a
hope
or
perhaps
an
opinion
rather
than
a
hope
that
the
marriage
would
not
take
place
quite
immediately
under
these
circumstances
herbert
hardly
spoke
further
to
his
father
upon
the
matter
he
certainly
did
feel
sore
that
he
should
be
so
treated
that
he
should
be
made
to
understand
that
there
was
a
difficulty
but
that
the
difficulty
could
not
be
explained
to
him
no
absolute
opposition
was
however
made
and
he
would
not
therefore
complain
as
to
money
he
would
say
nothing
till
something
should
be
said
to
him
with
his
mother
however
the
matter
was
different
she
had
said
that
she
would
welcome
clara
and
she
did
so
immediately
after
speaking
to
sir
thomas
she
drove
over
to
desmond
court
and
said
soft
sweet
things
to
clara
in
her
most
winning
way
said
soft
things
also
to
the
countess
who
received
them
very
graciously
took
clara
home
to
castle
richmond
for
that
night
somewhat
to
the
surprise
and
much
to
the
gratification
of
herbert
who
found
her
sitting
slily
with
the
other
girls
when
he
came
in
before
dinner
and
arranged
for
her
to
make
a
longer
visit
after
the
interval
of
a
week
or
two
herbert
therefore
was
on
thoroughly
good
terms
with
his
mother
and
did
enjoy
some
of
the
delights
which
he
had
promised
himself
with
his
sisters
also
and
especially
with
emmeline
he
was
once
more
in
a
good
humour
to
her
he
made
ample
apology
for
his
former
crossness
and
received
ample
absolution
i
was
so
harassed
he
said
by
my
father
manner
that
i
hardly
knew
what
i
was
doing
and
even
now
when
i
think
of
his
evident
dislike
to
the
marriage
it
nearly
drives
me
wild
the
truth
of
all
which
emmeline
sadly
acknowledged
how
could
any
of
them
talk
of
their
father
except
in
a
strain
of
sadness
all
these
things
did
not
happen
in
the
at
castle
richmond
without
also
being
discussed
in
the
kitchen
it
was
soon
known
over
the
house
that
master
herbert
was
to
marry
lady
clara
and
indeed
there
was
no
great
pretence
of
keeping
it
secret
the
girls
told
the
duchess
as
they
called
jones
of
course
in
confidence
but
jones
knew
what
such
confidence
meant
especially
as
the
matter
was
more
than
once
distinctly
alluded
to
by
her
ladyship
and
thus
the
story
was
told
in
confidence
to
everybody
in
the
establishment
and
then
repeated
by
them
in
confidence
also
to
nearly
everybody
out
of
it
ill
news
they
say
flies
fast
and
this
news
which
going
in
that
direction
became
ill
soon
flew
to
hap
house
so
young
fitzgerald
and
the
divine
clara
are
to
hit
it
off
are
they
said
captain
donnellan
who
had
driven
over
from
buttevant
barracks
to
breakfast
at
hap
house
on
a
there
were
other
men
present
more
intimate
friends
of
owen
than
this
captain
who
had
known
of
owen
misfortune
in
that
quarter
and
a
sign
was
made
to
donnellan
to
bid
him
drop
the
subject
but
it
was
too
late
who
my
cousin
herbert
said
owen
sharply
have
you
heard
of
this
barry
well
said
barry
those
sort
of
things
are
always
being
said
you
know
i
did
hear
something
of
it
somewhere
but
i
ca
say
i
thought
much
about
it
and
then
the
subject
was
dropped
during
that
morning
breakfast
they
all
went
to
the
hunt
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
owen
contrived
to
learn
that
the
report
was
well
founded
that
evening
as
the
countess
and
her
daughter
were
sitting
together
over
the
fire
the
old
butler
brought
in
a
letter
upon
an
old
silver
salver
saying
for
lady
clara
if
you
please
my
lady
the
countess
not
unnaturally
thought
that
the
despatch
had
come
from
castle
richmond
and
smiled
graciously
as
clara
put
out
her
hand
for
the
missive
lady
desmond
again
let
her
eyes
drop
upon
the
book
which
she
was
reading
as
though
to
show
that
she
was
by
far
too
confiding
a
mamma
to
interfere
in
any
correspondence
between
her
daughter
and
her
daughter
lover
at
the
moment
lady
clara
had
been
doing
nothing
her
work
was
indeed
on
her
lap
and
her
workbox
was
at
her
elbow
but
her
thoughts
had
been
far
away
far
away
as
regards
idea
though
not
so
as
to
absolute
locality
for
in
her
mind
she
was
walking
beneath
those
and
a
man
was
near
her
with
a
horse
following
at
his
heels
the
messenger
is
to
wait
for
an
answer
my
lady
said
the
old
butler
with
a
second
nod
which
on
this
occasion
was
addressed
to
clara
and
then
the
man
withdrew
lady
clara
blushed
ruby
red
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
when
her
eyes
fell
on
the
address
of
the
letter
for
she
knew
it
to
be
in
the
handwriting
of
owen
fitzgerald
perhaps
the
countess
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
may
have
observed
some
portion
of
her
daughter
blushes
but
if
so
she
said
nothing
attributing
them
to
clara
natural
bashfulness
in
her
present
position
she
will
get
over
it
soon
the
countess
may
probably
have
said
to
herself
clara
was
indecisive
disturbed
in
her
mind
and
wretched
owen
had
sent
her
other
letters
but
they
had
been
brought
to
her
surreptitiously
had
been
tendered
to
her
in
secret
and
had
always
been
returned
by
her
unopened
she
had
not
told
her
mother
of
these
at
least
not
purposely
or
at
the
moment
but
she
had
been
at
no
trouble
to
conceal
the
facts
and
when
the
countess
had
once
asked
she
freely
told
her
what
had
happened
with
an
absence
of
any
confusion
which
had
quite
put
lady
desmond
at
her
ease
but
this
letter
was
brought
to
her
in
the
most
open
manner
and
an
answer
to
it
openly
demanded
she
turned
it
round
slowly
in
her
hand
and
then
looking
up
said
mamma
this
is
from
owen
fitzgerald
what
had
i
better
do
with
it
from
owen
fitzgerald
are
you
sure
yes
mamma
and
then
the
countess
had
also
to
consider
what
steps
under
such
circumstances
had
better
be
taken
in
the
mean
time
clara
held
out
her
hand
tendering
the
letter
to
her
mother
you
had
better
open
it
my
dear
and
read
it
no
doubt
it
must
be
answered
lady
desmond
felt
that
now
there
could
be
no
danger
from
owen
fitzgerald
indeed
she
thought
that
there
was
not
a
remembrance
of
him
left
in
her
daughter
bosom
that
the
old
love
such
as
there
had
been
had
vanished
quite
swept
out
of
that
little
heart
by
this
new
love
of
a
brighter
sort
but
then
lady
desmond
knew
nothing
of
her
daughter
so
instructed
clara
broke
the
seal
and
read
the
letter
which
ran
thus
hap
house
february
my
promised
love
for
let
what
will
happen
such
you
are
i
have
this
morning
heard
tidings
which
if
true
will
go
far
to
drive
me
to
despair
but
i
will
not
believe
them
from
any
lips
save
your
own
i
have
heard
that
you
are
engaged
to
marry
herbert
fitzgerald
at
once
however
i
declare
that
i
do
not
believe
the
statement
i
have
known
you
too
well
to
think
that
you
can
be
false
but
at
any
rate
i
beg
the
favour
of
an
interview
with
you
after
what
has
passed
i
think
that
under
any
circumstances
i
have
a
right
to
demand
it
i
have
pledged
myself
to
you
and
as
that
pledge
has
been
accepted
i
am
entitled
to
some
consideration
i
write
this
letter
to
you
openly
being
quite
willing
that
you
should
show
it
to
your
mother
if
you
think
fit
my
messenger
will
wait
and
i
do
implore
you
to
send
me
an
answer
and
remember
lady
clara
that
having
accepted
my
love
you
can
not
whistle
me
down
the
wind
as
though
i
were
of
no
account
after
what
has
passed
between
us
you
can
not
surely
refuse
to
see
me
once
more
ever
your
own
if
you
will
have
it
so
owen
fitzgerald
she
read
the
letter
very
slowly
ever
and
anon
looking
up
at
her
mother
face
and
seeing
that
her
mother
was
not
reading
her
book
but
pretending
to
read
it
when
she
had
finished
it
she
held
it
for
a
moment
and
then
said
mamma
will
you
not
look
at
it
certainly
my
dear
if
you
wish
me
to
do
so
and
she
took
the
letter
from
her
daughter
hand
and
read
it
just
what
one
would
expect
from
him
my
dear
eager
impetuous
and
thoughtless
one
should
not
blame
him
much
for
he
does
not
mean
to
do
harm
but
if
he
had
any
sense
he
would
know
that
he
was
taking
trouble
for
nothing
and
what
shall
i
do
mamma
well
i
really
think
that
i
should
answer
him
it
was
delightful
to
see
the
perfect
confidence
which
the
mother
had
in
her
daughter
and
i
think
i
should
see
him
if
he
will
insist
upon
it
it
is
foolish
in
him
to
persist
in
remembering
two
words
which
you
spoke
to
him
as
a
child
but
perhaps
it
will
be
well
that
you
should
tell
him
yourself
that
you
were
a
child
when
you
spoke
those
two
words
and
then
clara
sent
off
the
following
reply
written
under
her
mother
dictation
though
the
countess
strove
very
hard
to
convince
her
daughter
that
she
was
wording
it
out
of
her
own
head
lady
clara
desmond
presents
her
compliments
to
owen
fitzgerald
and
will
see
owen
fitzgerald
at
desmond
court
at
two
if
owen
fitzgerald
persists
in
demanding
such
an
interview
lady
clara
desmond
however
wishes
to
express
her
opinion
that
it
would
be
better
avoided
desmond
court
thursday
evening
the
countess
thought
that
this
note
was
very
cold
and
formal
and
would
be
altogether
conclusive
but
nevertheless
at
about
eleven
that
night
there
came
another
messenger
from
hap
house
with
another
letter
saying
that
owen
would
be
at
desmond
court
at
two
on
the
following
day
he
is
very
foolish
that
is
all
i
can
say
said
the
countess
all
that
night
and
all
the
next
morning
poor
clara
was
very
wretched
that
she
had
been
right
to
give
up
a
suitor
who
lived
such
a
life
as
owen
fitzgerald
lived
she
could
not
doubt
but
nevertheless
was
she
true
in
giving
him
up
had
she
made
any
stipulation
as
to
his
life
when
she
accepted
his
love
if
he
called
her
false
as
doubtless
he
would
call
her
how
would
she
defend
herself
had
she
any
defence
to
offer
it
was
not
only
that
she
had
rejected
him
a
poor
lover
but
she
had
accepted
a
rich
lover
what
could
she
say
to
him
when
he
upbraided
her
for
such
sordid
conduct
and
then
as
to
her
whistling
him
down
the
wind
did
she
wish
to
do
that
in
what
state
did
her
heart
stand
towards
him
might
it
not
be
that
let
her
be
ever
so
much
on
her
guard
she
would
show
him
some
tenderness
tenderness
which
would
be
treason
to
her
present
affianced
suitor
oh
why
had
her
mother
desired
her
to
go
through
such
an
interview
as
this
when
two
came
clara
was
in
the
she
had
said
nothing
to
her
mother
as
to
the
manner
in
which
this
meeting
should
take
place
but
then
at
first
she
had
had
an
idea
that
lady
desmond
would
be
present
but
as
the
time
came
near
clara
was
still
alone
when
her
watch
told
her
that
it
was
already
two
she
was
still
by
herself
and
when
the
old
servant
opening
the
door
announced
that
fitzgerald
was
there
she
was
still
unsupported
by
the
presence
of
any
companion
it
was
very
surprising
that
on
such
an
occasion
her
mother
should
have
kept
herself
away
she
had
not
seen
owen
fitzgerald
since
that
day
when
they
had
walked
together
under
the
and
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
she
saw
him
now
she
had
a
feeling
that
she
had
injured
him
had
deceived
and
in
a
manner
betrayed
him
and
that
feeling
became
so
powerful
with
her
that
she
hardly
dared
to
look
him
in
the
face
he
when
he
entered
the
room
walked
straight
up
to
her
and
offered
her
his
hand
he
too
looked
round
the
room
to
see
whether
lady
desmond
was
there
and
not
finding
her
was
surprised
he
had
hardly
hoped
that
such
an
opportunity
would
be
allowed
to
him
for
declaring
the
strength
of
his
passion
she
got
up
and
taking
his
hand
muttered
something
it
certainly
did
not
matter
what
for
it
was
inaudible
but
such
as
the
words
were
they
were
the
first
spoken
between
them
lady
clara
he
began
and
then
stopped
himself
and
considering
recommenced
clara
a
report
has
reached
my
ears
which
i
will
believe
from
no
lips
but
your
own
she
now
sat
down
on
a
sofa
and
pointed
to
a
chair
for
him
but
he
remained
standing
and
did
so
during
the
whole
interview
or
rather
walking
for
when
he
became
energetic
and
impetuous
he
moved
about
from
place
to
place
in
the
room
as
though
incapable
of
fixing
himself
in
one
position
clara
was
ignorant
whether
or
no
it
behoved
her
to
rebuke
him
for
calling
her
simply
by
her
christian
name
she
thought
that
she
ought
to
do
so
but
she
did
not
do
it
i
have
been
told
he
continued
that
you
have
engaged
yourself
to
marry
herbert
fitzgerald
and
i
have
now
come
to
hear
a
contradiction
of
this
from
yourself
but
fitzgerald
it
is
true
it
is
true
that
herbert
fitzgerald
is
your
accepted
lover
yes
she
said
looking
down
upon
the
ground
and
blushing
deeply
as
she
said
it
there
was
a
pause
of
a
few
moments
during
which
she
felt
that
the
full
fire
of
his
glance
was
fixed
upon
her
and
then
he
spoke
you
may
well
be
ashamed
to
confess
it
he
said
you
may
well
feel
that
you
dare
not
look
me
in
the
face
as
you
pronounce
the
words
i
would
have
believed
it
clara
from
no
other
mouth
than
your
own
it
appeared
to
clara
herself
now
as
though
she
were
greatly
a
culprit
she
had
not
a
word
to
say
in
her
own
defence
all
those
arguments
as
to
owen
ill
course
of
life
were
forgotten
and
she
could
only
remember
that
she
had
acknowledged
that
she
loved
him
and
that
she
was
now
acknowledging
that
she
loved
another
but
now
owen
had
made
his
accusation
and
as
it
was
not
answered
he
hardly
knew
how
to
proceed
he
walked
about
the
room
endeavouring
to
think
what
he
had
better
say
next
i
know
this
clara
it
is
your
mother
doing
and
not
your
own
you
could
not
bring
yourself
to
be
false
unless
by
her
instigation
no
said
she
you
are
wrong
there
it
is
not
my
mother
doing
what
i
have
done
i
have
done
myself
is
it
not
true
he
asked
that
your
word
was
pledged
to
me
had
you
not
promised
me
that
you
would
be
my
wife
i
was
very
young
she
said
falling
back
upon
the
only
excuse
which
occurred
to
her
at
the
moment
as
being
possible
to
be
used
without
incriminating
him
young
is
not
that
your
mother
teaching
why
those
were
her
very
words
when
she
came
to
me
at
my
house
i
did
not
know
that
youth
was
any
excuse
for
falsehood
but
it
may
be
an
excuse
for
folly
said
clara
folly
what
folly
the
folly
of
loving
a
poor
suitor
the
folly
of
being
willing
to
marry
a
man
who
has
not
a
large
estate
clara
i
did
not
think
that
you
could
have
learned
so
much
in
so
short
a
time
all
this
was
very
hard
upon
her
she
felt
that
it
was
hard
for
she
knew
that
he
had
done
that
which
entitled
her
to
regard
her
pledge
to
him
as
at
an
end
but
the
circumstances
were
such
that
she
could
not
excuse
herself
am
i
to
understand
said
owen
fitzgerald
that
all
that
has
passed
between
us
is
to
go
for
nothing
that
such
promises
as
we
have
made
to
each
other
are
to
be
of
no
account
to
me
they
are
sacred
pledges
from
which
i
would
not
escape
even
if
i
could
as
he
then
paused
for
a
reply
she
was
obliged
to
say
something
i
hope
you
have
not
come
here
to
upbraid
me
mr
fitzgerald
clara
he
continued
i
have
passed
the
last
year
with
perfect
reliance
upon
your
faith
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
it
has
not
been
passed
happily
for
it
has
been
passed
without
seeing
you
but
though
you
have
been
absent
from
me
i
have
never
doubted
you
i
have
known
that
it
was
necessary
that
we
should
wait
wait
perhaps
till
years
should
make
you
mistress
of
your
own
actions
but
nevertheless
i
was
not
unhappy
for
i
was
sure
of
your
love
now
it
was
undoubtedly
the
case
that
fitzgerald
was
treating
her
unfairly
and
though
she
had
not
her
wits
enough
about
her
to
ascertain
this
by
process
of
argument
nevertheless
the
idea
did
come
home
to
her
it
was
true
that
she
had
promised
her
love
to
this
man
as
far
as
such
promise
could
be
conveyed
by
one
word
of
assent
but
it
was
true
also
that
she
had
been
almost
a
child
when
she
pronounced
that
word
and
that
things
which
had
since
occurred
had
entitled
her
to
annul
any
amount
of
contract
to
which
she
might
have
been
supposed
to
bind
herself
by
that
one
word
she
bethought
herself
therefore
that
as
she
was
so
hard
pressed
she
was
forced
to
defend
herself
i
was
very
young
then
fitzgerald
and
hardly
knew
what
i
was
saying
afterwards
when
mamma
spoke
to
me
i
felt
that
i
was
bound
to
obey
her
what
to
obey
her
by
forgetting
me
no
i
have
never
forgotten
you
and
never
shall
i
remember
too
well
your
kindness
to
my
brother
your
kindness
to
us
all
psha
you
know
i
do
not
speak
of
that
are
you
bound
to
obey
your
mother
by
forgetting
that
you
have
loved
me
she
paused
a
moment
before
she
answered
him
looking
now
full
before
her
hardly
yet
bold
enough
to
look
him
in
the
face
no
she
said
i
have
not
forgotten
that
i
loved
you
i
shall
never
forget
it
child
as
i
was
it
shall
never
be
forgotten
but
i
can
not
love
you
now
not
in
the
manner
you
would
have
me
and
why
not
lady
clara
why
is
love
to
cease
on
your
part
to
be
thrown
aside
so
easily
by
you
while
with
me
it
remains
so
stern
a
fact
and
so
deep
a
necessity
is
that
just
when
the
bargain
has
once
been
made
should
it
not
be
equally
binding
on
us
both
i
do
not
think
you
are
fair
to
me
fitzgerald
she
said
and
some
spirit
was
now
rising
in
her
bosom
not
fair
to
you
do
you
say
that
i
am
unfair
to
you
speak
but
one
word
to
say
that
the
troth
which
you
pledged
me
a
year
since
shall
still
remain
unbroken
and
i
will
at
once
leave
you
till
you
yourself
shall
name
the
time
when
my
suit
may
be
renewed
you
know
that
i
can
not
do
that
and
why
not
i
know
that
you
ought
to
do
it
no
fitzgerald
i
ought
not
i
am
now
engaged
to
your
cousin
with
the
consent
of
mamma
and
of
his
friends
i
can
say
nothing
to
you
now
which
i
can
not
repeat
to
him
nor
can
i
say
anything
which
shall
oppose
his
wishes
he
is
then
so
much
more
to
you
now
than
i
am
he
is
everything
to
me
now
that
is
all
the
reply
i
am
to
get
then
you
acknowledge
your
falseness
and
throw
me
off
without
vouchsafing
me
any
answer
beyond
this
what
would
you
have
me
say
i
did
do
that
which
was
wrong
and
foolish
when
when
we
were
walking
there
on
the
avenue
i
did
give
a
promise
which
i
can
not
now
keep
it
was
all
so
hurried
that
i
hardly
remember
what
i
said
but
of
this
i
am
sure
that
if
i
have
caused
you
unhappiness
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
done
so
i
can
not
alter
it
all
now
i
can
not
unsay
what
i
said
then
nor
can
i
offer
you
that
which
i
have
now
absolutely
given
to
another
and
then
as
she
finished
speaking
she
did
pluck
up
courage
to
look
him
in
the
face
she
was
now
standing
as
well
as
he
but
she
was
so
standing
that
the
table
which
was
placed
near
the
sofa
was
still
between
him
and
her
as
she
finished
speaking
the
door
opened
and
the
countess
of
desmond
walked
slowly
into
the
room
owen
fitzgerald
when
he
saw
her
bowed
low
before
her
and
then
frankly
offered
her
his
hand
there
was
something
in
his
manner
to
ladies
devoid
of
all
bashfulness
and
yet
never
too
bold
he
seemed
to
be
aware
that
in
speaking
to
any
lady
be
she
who
she
might
he
was
only
exercising
his
undoubted
privilege
as
a
man
he
never
hummed
and
hawed
and
shook
in
his
shoes
as
though
the
majesty
of
womanhood
were
too
great
for
his
encounter
there
are
such
men
and
many
of
them
who
carry
this
dread
to
the
last
day
of
their
long
lives
i
have
often
wondered
what
women
think
of
men
who
regard
women
as
too
awful
for
the
free
exercise
of
open
speech
fitzgerald
she
said
accepting
the
hand
which
he
offered
to
her
but
resuming
her
own
very
quickly
and
then
standing
before
him
in
all
the
dignity
which
she
was
able
to
assume
i
quite
concurred
with
my
daughter
that
it
was
right
that
she
should
see
you
as
you
insisted
on
such
an
interview
but
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
interrupt
it
i
must
protect
her
from
the
embarrassment
which
your
your
vehemence
may
occasion
her
lady
desmond
he
replied
you
are
quite
at
liberty
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
to
hear
all
that
passes
between
us
your
daughter
is
betrothed
to
me
and
i
have
come
to
claim
from
her
the
fulfilment
of
her
promise
for
shame
fitzgerald
for
shame
when
she
was
a
child
you
extracted
from
her
one
word
of
folly
and
now
you
would
take
advantage
of
that
foolish
word
now
when
you
know
that
she
is
engaged
to
a
man
she
loves
with
the
full
consent
of
all
her
friends
i
thought
i
knew
you
well
enough
to
feel
sure
that
you
were
not
so
ungenerous
ungenerous
no
i
have
not
that
generosity
which
would
enable
me
to
give
up
my
very
heart
blood
the
only
joy
of
my
soul
to
such
a
one
as
my
cousin
herbert
you
have
nothing
to
give
up
fitzgerald
you
must
have
known
from
the
very
first
that
my
daughter
could
not
marry
you
not
marry
me
and
why
not
lady
desmond
is
not
my
blood
as
good
as
his
unless
indeed
you
are
prepared
to
sell
your
child
to
the
highest
bidder
clara
my
dear
i
think
you
had
better
leave
the
room
said
the
countess
no
doubt
you
have
assured
fitzgerald
that
you
are
engaged
to
his
cousin
herbert
yes
mamma
then
he
can
have
no
further
claim
on
your
attendance
and
his
vehemence
will
terrify
you
vehement
how
can
i
help
being
vehement
when
like
a
ruined
gambler
i
am
throwing
my
last
chance
for
such
a
stake
and
then
he
intercepted
clara
as
she
stepped
towards
the
door
she
stopped
in
her
course
and
stood
still
looking
down
upon
the
ground
fitzgerald
said
the
countess
i
will
thank
you
to
let
lady
clara
leave
the
room
she
has
given
you
the
answer
for
which
you
have
asked
and
it
would
not
be
right
in
me
to
permit
her
to
be
subjected
to
further
embarrassment
i
will
only
ask
her
to
listen
to
one
word
clara
fitzgerald
you
have
no
right
to
address
my
daughter
with
that
freedom
said
the
countess
but
owen
hardly
seemed
to
hear
her
i
here
in
your
hearing
protest
against
your
marriage
with
herbert
fitzgerald
i
claim
your
love
as
my
own
i
bid
you
think
of
the
promise
which
you
gave
me
and
i
tell
you
that
as
i
loved
you
then
with
all
my
heart
so
do
i
love
you
at
this
moment
so
shall
i
love
you
always
now
i
will
not
hinder
you
any
longer
and
then
he
opened
the
door
for
her
and
she
passed
on
bowing
to
him
and
muttering
some
word
of
farewell
that
was
inaudible
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
the
door
in
his
hand
meditating
whether
he
might
not
say
good
morning
to
the
countess
without
returning
into
the
room
but
as
he
so
stood
she
called
him
fitzgerald
she
said
and
so
he
therefore
came
back
and
once
more
closed
the
door
and
then
he
saw
that
the
countenance
of
lady
desmond
was
much
changed
hitherto
she
had
been
every
inch
the
countess
stern
and
cold
and
haughty
but
now
she
looked
at
him
as
she
used
to
look
in
those
old
winter
evenings
when
they
were
accustomed
to
talk
together
over
the
evening
fire
in
close
friendliness
while
she
lady
desmond
would
speak
to
him
in
the
intimacy
of
her
heart
of
her
children
patrick
and
clara
fitzgerald
she
said
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
also
was
changed
you
are
hardly
fair
to
us
are
you
not
fair
lady
desmond
no
not
fair
sit
down
now
and
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
if
you
had
a
child
a
penniless
girl
like
clara
would
you
be
glad
to
see
her
married
to
such
a
one
as
you
are
yourself
in
what
way
do
you
mean
speak
out
lady
desmond
no
i
will
not
speak
out
for
i
would
not
hurt
you
i
myself
am
too
fond
of
you
as
an
old
friend
to
wish
to
do
so
that
you
may
marry
and
live
happily
live
near
us
here
so
that
we
may
know
you
i
most
heartily
desire
but
you
can
not
marry
that
child
and
why
not
if
she
loves
me
nay
not
even
if
she
did
wealth
and
position
are
necessary
to
the
station
in
which
she
has
been
born
she
is
an
earl
daughter
penniless
as
she
is
i
will
have
no
secrets
from
you
as
a
mother
i
could
not
give
her
to
one
whose
career
is
such
as
yours
as
the
widow
of
an
earl
i
could
not
give
her
to
one
whose
means
of
maintaining
her
are
so
small
if
you
will
think
of
this
you
will
hardly
be
angry
with
me
love
is
nothing
then
is
all
to
be
sacrificed
to
your
love
think
of
it
fitzgerald
and
let
me
have
the
happiness
of
knowing
that
you
consent
to
this
match
never
said
he
never
and
so
he
left
the
room
without
wishing
her
further
farewell
chapter
xv
diplomacy
about
a
week
after
the
last
conversation
that
has
been
related
as
having
taken
place
at
the
kanturk
hotel
mollett
junior
was
on
his
way
to
castle
richmond
he
had
on
that
occasion
stated
his
intention
of
making
such
a
journey
with
the
view
of
freshening
the
old
gentleman
up
a
bit
and
although
his
father
did
all
in
his
power
to
prevent
the
journey
going
so
far
on
one
occasion
as
to
swear
that
if
it
was
made
he
would
throw
over
the
game
altogether
nevertheless
aby
persevered
you
may
leave
the
boards
whenever
you
like
governor
said
aby
i
know
quite
enough
of
the
part
to
carry
on
the
play
you
think
you
do
said
the
father
in
his
anger
but
you
find
yourself
in
the
dark
yet
before
you
done
and
then
again
he
expostulated
in
a
different
tone
you
ruin
it
all
aby
you
will
indeed
you
do
know
all
the
circumstances
indeed
you
do
do
i
said
aby
then
i
not
be
long
learning
them
the
father
did
what
he
could
but
he
had
no
means
of
keeping
his
son
at
home
and
so
aby
went
aby
doubtless
entertained
an
idea
that
his
father
was
deficient
in
pluck
for
the
management
of
so
difficult
a
matter
and
that
he
could
supply
what
his
father
wanted
so
he
dressed
himself
in
his
best
and
having
hired
a
gig
and
a
man
who
he
flattered
himself
would
look
like
a
private
servant
he
started
from
cork
and
drove
himself
to
castle
richmond
he
had
on
different
occasions
been
down
in
the
neighbourhood
prowling
about
like
a
thief
in
the
night
picking
up
information
as
he
called
it
and
seeing
how
the
land
lay
but
he
had
never
yet
presented
himself
to
any
one
within
the
precincts
of
the
castle
richmond
demesne
his
present
intention
was
to
drive
up
to
the
front
door
and
ask
at
once
for
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
sending
in
his
card
if
need
be
on
which
were
printed
the
words
abraham
mollett
junior
with
the
additional
words
piccadilly
london
written
in
the
lower
corner
i
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
said
he
to
himself
it
better
to
make
the
spoon
at
once
even
if
we
do
run
some
small
chance
of
spoiling
the
horn
and
that
he
might
be
well
enabled
to
carry
out
his
purpose
with
reference
to
this
bull
he
lifted
his
flask
to
his
mouth
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
through
the
great
demesne
gate
and
took
a
long
pull
at
it
there
nothing
like
a
little
jumping
powder
he
said
speaking
to
himself
again
and
then
he
drove
boldly
up
the
avenue
he
had
not
yet
come
in
sight
of
the
house
when
he
met
two
gentlemen
walking
on
the
road
they
as
he
approached
stood
a
little
on
one
side
not
only
so
as
to
allow
him
to
pass
but
to
watch
him
as
he
did
so
they
were
somers
and
herbert
fitzgerald
it
is
the
younger
of
those
two
men
i
nearly
certain
of
it
said
somers
as
the
gig
approached
i
saw
him
as
he
walked
by
me
in
kanturk
street
and
i
do
think
i
can
mistake
the
horrid
impudence
of
his
face
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
and
now
he
addressed
mollett
in
the
gig
but
are
you
going
up
to
the
house
yes
sir
that
my
notion
just
at
present
any
commands
that
way
this
is
fitzgerald
herbert
fitzgerald
and
i
am
somers
the
agent
can
we
do
anything
for
you
aby
mollett
raised
his
hat
and
the
two
gentlemen
touched
theirs
sir
said
aby
but
i
believe
my
business
must
be
with
the
worthy
himself
more
particularly
as
i
to
know
that
he
at
home
my
father
is
not
very
well
said
herbert
and
i
do
not
think
that
he
will
be
able
to
see
you
i
take
the
liberty
of
hasking
and
of
sending
in
my
card
said
aby
and
he
gave
his
horse
a
flick
as
intending
thus
to
cut
short
the
conversation
but
somers
had
put
his
hand
upon
the
bridle
and
the
beast
was
contented
to
stand
still
if
you
have
the
kindness
to
wait
a
moment
said
somers
and
he
put
on
a
look
of
severity
which
he
well
knew
how
to
assume
and
which
somewhat
cowed
poor
aby
you
have
been
down
here
before
i
think
continued
somers
what
at
castle
richmond
no
i
have
and
if
i
had
what
that
to
you
if
sir
thomas
chooses
to
see
me
i
hai
hintruding
i
suppose
you
been
down
at
kanturk
before
once
or
twice
for
i
have
seen
you
and
supposing
i
been
there
ten
or
twelve
times
what
is
there
in
that
said
aby
somers
still
held
the
horse
head
and
stood
a
moment
considering
i
thank
you
to
let
go
my
said
aby
raising
his
whip
and
shaking
the
reins
what
do
you
say
your
name
is
asked
somers
i
did
say
my
name
was
anything
yet
i
hai
ashamed
of
it
however
nor
has
hany
cause
to
be
that
my
name
and
if
send
my
card
in
to
sir
thomas
with
my
compliments
and
say
that
hi
three
words
to
say
to
him
very
particular
why
hi
be
obliged
to
you
and
then
mollett
handed
somers
his
card
mollett
said
somers
very
unceremoniously
mollett
mollett
do
you
know
the
name
herbert
herbert
said
that
he
did
not
it
about
business
i
suppose
asked
somers
yes
said
aby
private
business
very
particular
the
same
that
brought
your
father
here
and
somers
again
looked
into
his
face
with
a
close
scrutiny
aby
was
abashed
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
did
not
answer
well
then
it
is
the
same
business
he
said
at
last
and
i
thank
you
to
let
me
go
on
i
not
used
to
be
stopped
in
this
way
you
can
follow
us
up
to
the
house
said
somers
to
him
come
here
herbert
and
then
they
walked
along
the
road
in
such
a
way
that
aby
was
forced
to
allow
his
horse
to
walk
after
them
these
are
the
men
who
are
doing
it
said
somers
in
a
whisper
to
his
companion
whatever
is
in
the
wind
whatever
may
be
the
cause
of
your
father
trouble
they
are
concerned
in
it
they
are
probably
getting
money
from
him
in
some
way
do
you
think
so
i
do
we
must
not
force
ourselves
upon
your
father
confidence
but
we
must
endeavour
to
save
him
from
this
misery
do
you
go
in
to
him
with
this
card
do
not
show
it
to
him
too
suddenly
and
then
find
out
whether
he
really
wishes
to
see
the
man
i
will
stay
about
the
place
for
it
may
be
possible
that
a
magistrate
will
be
wanted
and
in
such
a
matter
you
had
better
not
act
they
were
now
at
the
and
somers
turning
to
mollett
told
him
that
herbert
fitzgerald
would
carry
the
card
to
his
father
and
then
he
added
seeing
that
mollett
was
going
to
come
down
you
had
better
stay
in
the
gig
till
fitzgerald
comes
back
just
sit
where
you
are
you
get
an
answer
all
in
good
time
sir
thomas
was
crouching
over
the
fire
in
his
study
when
his
son
entered
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
a
letter
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
which
when
he
saw
herbert
he
closed
up
and
put
away
father
said
herbert
in
a
cheerful
voice
as
though
he
had
nothing
special
to
communicate
there
is
a
man
in
a
gig
out
there
he
says
he
wants
to
see
you
a
man
in
a
gig
and
herbert
could
see
that
his
father
had
already
begun
to
tremble
but
every
sound
made
him
tremble
now
yes
a
man
in
a
gig
what
is
it
he
says
his
name
is
i
have
his
card
here
a
young
man
oh
a
young
man
said
sir
thomas
yes
here
it
is
abraham
mollett
i
ca
say
that
your
friend
seems
to
be
very
respectable
in
spite
of
his
gig
and
herbert
handed
the
card
to
his
father
the
son
purposely
looked
away
as
he
mentioned
the
name
as
his
great
anxiety
was
not
to
occasion
distress
but
he
felt
that
the
sound
of
the
word
had
been
terrible
in
his
father
ears
sir
thomas
had
risen
from
his
chair
but
he
now
sat
down
again
or
rather
fell
into
it
but
nevertheless
he
took
the
card
and
said
that
he
would
see
the
man
a
young
man
do
you
say
herbert
yes
father
a
young
man
and
father
if
you
are
not
well
tell
me
what
the
business
is
and
let
me
see
him
but
sir
thomas
persisted
shaking
his
head
and
saying
that
he
would
see
the
man
himself
somers
is
out
there
will
you
let
him
do
it
no
i
wonder
herbert
that
you
can
tease
me
so
let
the
man
be
sent
in
here
but
oh
herbert
herbert
the
young
man
rushed
round
and
kneeled
at
his
father
knee
what
is
it
father
why
will
you
not
tell
me
i
know
you
have
some
grief
and
can
not
you
trust
me
do
you
not
know
that
you
can
trust
me
my
poor
boy
my
poor
boy
what
is
it
father
if
this
man
here
is
concerned
in
it
let
me
see
him
no
no
no
or
at
any
rate
let
me
be
with
you
when
he
is
here
let
me
share
your
trouble
if
i
can
do
nothing
to
cure
it
herbert
my
darling
leave
me
and
send
him
in
if
it
be
necessary
that
you
should
bear
this
calamity
it
will
come
upon
you
soon
enough
but
i
am
afraid
of
this
man
for
your
sake
father
he
will
do
me
no
harm
let
him
come
to
me
but
herbert
say
nothing
to
somers
about
this
somers
has
not
seen
the
man
has
he
yes
we
both
spoke
to
him
together
as
he
drove
up
the
avenue
and
what
did
he
say
did
he
say
anything
nothing
but
that
he
wanted
to
see
you
and
then
he
gave
his
card
to
somers
somers
wished
to
save
you
from
the
annoyance
why
should
it
annoy
me
to
see
any
man
let
somers
mind
his
own
business
surely
i
can
have
business
of
my
own
without
his
interference
with
this
herbert
left
his
father
and
returned
to
the
to
usher
in
mollett
junior
well
said
somers
who
was
standing
by
the
hall
fire
and
who
joined
herbert
at
the
front
door
my
father
will
see
the
man
and
have
you
learned
who
he
is
i
have
learned
nothing
but
this
that
sir
thomas
does
not
wish
that
we
should
inquire
now
mollett
sir
thomas
will
see
you
so
you
can
come
down
make
haste
now
and
remember
that
you
are
not
to
stay
long
for
my
father
is
and
then
leading
aby
through
the
hall
and
along
a
passage
he
introduced
him
into
sir
thomas
room
and
herbert
said
the
father
whereupon
herbert
again
turned
round
his
father
was
endeavouring
to
stand
but
supporting
himself
by
the
back
of
his
chair
do
not
disturb
me
for
half
an
hour
but
come
to
me
then
and
knock
at
the
door
this
gentleman
will
have
done
by
that
time
if
we
do
not
put
a
stop
to
this
your
father
will
be
in
a
or
on
his
before
long
so
spoke
somers
in
a
low
solemn
whisper
when
herbert
again
joined
him
at
the
sit
down
sir
sit
down
said
sir
thomas
endeavouring
to
be
civil
and
to
seem
at
his
ease
at
the
same
time
aby
was
himself
so
much
bewildered
for
the
moment
that
he
hardly
perceived
the
embarrassment
under
which
the
baronet
was
labouring
aby
sat
down
in
the
way
usual
to
such
men
in
such
places
on
the
corner
of
his
chair
and
put
his
hat
on
the
ground
between
his
feet
then
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
and
after
that
he
expressed
an
opinion
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
and
you
are
abraham
mollett
said
sir
thomas
yes
sir
thomas
that
my
name
i
believe
sir
thomas
that
you
have
the
pleasure
of
some
slight
acquaintance
with
my
father
matthew
mollett
what
a
pleasure
under
such
circumstances
sir
thomas
however
nodded
his
head
and
aby
went
on
well
now
sir
thomas
business
is
business
and
my
father
a
good
man
of
business
a
like
you
sir
thomas
has
seen
that
with
an
eye
i
know
and
then
he
waited
a
moment
for
an
answer
but
as
he
got
none
he
proceeded
my
governor
one
of
the
best
of
fellows
going
but
ai
sharp
and
decisive
sharp
the
word
now
a
days
sir
thomas
ai
it
and
he
spoke
this
in
a
manner
so
suited
to
the
doctrine
which
he
intended
to
inculcate
that
the
poor
old
gentleman
almost
jumped
up
in
his
chair
and
aby
seeing
this
seated
himself
more
comfortably
in
his
own
the
awe
which
the
gilt
bindings
of
the
books
and
the
thorough
comfort
of
the
room
had
at
first
inspired
was
already
beginning
to
fade
away
he
had
come
there
to
bully
and
though
his
courage
had
failed
him
for
a
moment
under
the
stern
eye
of
somers
it
quickly
returned
to
him
now
that
he
was
able
to
see
how
weak
was
his
actual
victim
sharp
the
word
sir
thomas
and
my
governor
ai
sharp
not
sharp
as
he
ought
to
be
in
such
a
matter
as
this
this
is
what
i
calls
a
real
bit
of
cheese
now
it
no
good
going
on
piddling
and
peddling
in
such
a
case
as
this
is
it
now
sir
thomas
sir
thomas
muttered
something
but
it
was
no
more
than
a
groan
not
the
least
use
continued
aby
now
the
question
as
i
takes
it
is
this
there
your
son
there
as
fetched
me
in
a
fine
young
is
as
ever
i
saw
i
will
say
that
well
now
who
to
have
this
property
when
you
walk
the
plank
as
walk
it
you
must
some
day
in
course
is
it
to
be
this
son
of
yours
or
is
it
to
be
this
other
fitzgerald
of
now
if
you
ask
me
i
all
for
your
son
though
maybe
he
may
be
all
right
as
regards
the
dam
there
was
certainly
some
truth
in
what
aby
had
said
with
reference
to
his
father
mollett
senior
had
never
debated
the
matter
in
terms
sharp
and
decisive
as
these
were
think
who
they
were
of
whom
this
brute
was
talking
to
that
wretched
gentleman
the
wife
of
his
bosom
than
whom
no
wife
was
ever
more
dearly
prized
the
son
of
his
love
the
centre
of
all
his
hopes
the
heir
of
his
wealth
if
that
might
still
be
so
and
yet
he
listened
to
such
words
as
these
and
did
not
call
in
his
servants
to
turn
the
speaker
of
them
out
of
his
doors
i
no
wish
for
that
man
sir
thomas
not
the
least
and
as
for
your
good
lady
she
nothing
to
me
one
way
or
the
other
whatever
she
may
be
to
my
governor
and
here
there
fell
a
spasm
upon
the
poor
man
heart
which
nearly
brought
him
from
the
chair
to
the
ground
but
nevertheless
he
still
contained
himself
my
governor
former
lady
my
own
mother
continued
aby
whom
i
never
see
she
gone
to
kingdom
come
you
know
before
that
time
sir
thomas
there
hai
no
doubt
about
that
so
you
see
and
hereupon
he
dropped
his
voice
from
the
tone
which
he
had
hitherto
been
using
to
an
absolute
whisper
and
drawing
his
chair
close
to
that
of
the
baronet
and
putting
his
hands
upon
his
knees
brought
his
mouth
close
to
his
companion
ear
so
you
see
he
said
when
that
youngster
was
born
lady
was
was
she
and
for
the
matter
of
that
lady
is
to
this
very
hour
that
the
real
chat
ai
it
sir
thomas
my
stepmother
you
know
the
governor
could
take
her
away
with
him
if
he
chose
according
to
the
law
of
the
land
could
he
now
there
was
no
piddling
or
peddling
about
this
at
any
rate
old
mollett
in
discussing
the
matter
with
his
victim
had
done
so
by
hints
and
inuendos
through
long
windings
by
signs
and
the
dropping
of
a
few
dark
words
he
had
never
once
mentioned
in
full
terms
the
name
of
lady
fitzgerald
had
never
absolutely
stated
that
he
did
possess
or
ever
had
possessed
a
wife
it
had
been
sufficient
for
him
to
imbue
sir
thomas
with
the
knowledge
that
his
son
herbert
was
in
great
danger
as
to
his
heritage
doubtless
the
two
had
understood
each
other
but
the
absolute
naked
horror
of
the
surmised
facts
had
been
kept
delicately
out
of
sight
but
such
delicacy
was
not
to
taste
sharp
short
and
decisive
that
was
his
motto
no
long√¶
ambages
for
him
the
whip
was
in
his
hand
as
he
thought
and
he
could
best
master
the
team
by
using
it
and
yet
sir
thomas
lived
and
bore
it
as
he
sat
there
half
stupefied
numbed
as
it
were
by
the
intensity
of
his
grief
he
wondered
at
his
own
power
of
endurance
she
is
you
know
ai
she
now
he
could
sit
there
and
hear
that
and
yet
live
through
it
so
much
he
could
do
and
did
do
but
as
for
speaking
that
was
beyond
him
young
mollett
thought
that
this
freshening
up
of
the
old
gentleman
seemed
to
answer
so
he
continued
yes
sir
thomas
your
son
my
favourite
i
tell
you
fairly
but
then
you
know
if
i
backs
the
favourite
in
course
i
likes
to
win
upon
him
how
is
it
to
be
now
and
then
he
paused
for
an
answer
which
however
was
not
forthcoming
you
see
you
have
been
dealing
quite
on
the
square
with
the
governor
you
two
is
has
it
were
in
a
boat
together
we
call
that
boat
the
lady
or
the
which
ever
you
like
and
then
aby
laughed
for
the
conceit
pleased
him
but
the
hearnings
of
that
boat
should
be
divided
hequally
ai
that
about
the
ticket
heh
sir
thomas
come
do
be
down
on
your
luck
a
little
quiet
between
you
and
me
soon
put
this
small
matter
on
a
right
footing
what
is
it
you
want
tell
me
at
once
at
last
groaned
the
poor
man
well
now
that
something
like
and
i
tell
you
what
we
want
there
are
only
two
of
us
you
know
the
governor
and
i
and
very
lonely
we
are
for
it
a
sad
thing
for
a
man
to
have
the
wife
of
his
bosom
taken
from
him
then
there
was
a
groan
which
struck
even
aby
ear
but
sir
thomas
was
still
alive
and
listening
and
so
he
went
on
this
property
here
sir
thomas
is
a
good
twelve
thousand
a
year
i
know
hall
about
it
as
though
i
been
it
myself
for
the
last
ten
years
and
a
great
deal
of
cutting
there
is
in
twelve
thousand
a
year
you
your
whack
out
of
it
and
now
we
wants
to
have
hourn
that
henglish
hai
it
did
your
father
send
you
here
mr
mollett
never
you
mind
who
sent
me
sir
thomas
perhaps
he
did
and
perhaps
he
did
perhaps
i
came
without
hany
sending
perhaps
i
more
hup
to
this
sort
of
work
than
he
is
at
any
rate
i
got
the
part
pretty
well
by
you
see
that
do
you
well
hour
hultimatum
about
the
business
is
this
forty
thousand
pounds
paid
down
on
the
nail
half
to
the
governor
and
half
to
your
servant
before
the
end
of
this
year
a
couple
of
thousand
more
in
hand
for
the
year
hexpenses
and
and
a
couple
of
hundred
or
so
now
at
once
before
i
leave
you
for
to
tell
the
truth
we
run
huncommonly
dry
just
at
the
present
moment
and
then
aby
drew
his
breath
and
paused
for
an
answer
poor
sir
thomas
was
now
almost
broken
down
his
head
swam
round
and
round
and
he
felt
that
he
was
in
a
whirlpool
from
which
there
was
no
escape
he
had
heard
the
sum
named
and
knew
that
he
had
no
power
of
raising
it
his
interest
in
the
estate
was
but
for
his
life
and
that
life
was
now
all
but
run
out
he
had
already
begun
to
feel
that
his
son
must
be
sacrificed
but
he
had
struggled
and
endured
in
order
that
he
might
save
his
wife
but
what
could
he
do
now
what
further
struggle
could
he
make
his
present
most
eager
desire
was
that
that
horrid
man
should
be
removed
from
his
hearing
and
his
eyesight
but
aby
had
not
yet
done
he
had
hitherto
omitted
to
mention
one
not
inconsiderable
portion
of
the
amicable
arrangement
which
according
to
him
would
have
the
effect
of
once
more
placing
the
two
families
comfortably
on
their
feet
there
one
other
pint
sir
thomas
he
continued
and
hif
i
can
bring
you
and
your
good
lady
to
my
way
of
thinking
on
that
why
we
may
all
be
comfortable
for
all
that
is
come
and
gone
you
a
daughter
hemmeline
what
said
sir
thomas
turning
upon
him
for
there
was
still
so
much
of
life
left
in
him
that
he
could
turn
upon
his
foe
when
he
heard
his
daughter
name
thus
polluted
has
lovely
a
gal
to
my
way
of
thinking
as
my
heyes
ever
rested
on
and
i
not
haccounted
a
bad
judge
of
such
cattle
i
can
tell
you
sir
thomas
that
will
do
that
will
do
said
sir
thomas
attempting
to
rise
but
still
holding
on
by
the
back
of
his
chair
you
can
go
now
sir
i
can
not
hear
more
from
you
go
yes
sir
go
i
know
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
sir
thomas
if
you
like
to
give
me
your
daughter
hemmeline
for
my
wife
whatever
her
fortin
to
be
i
take
it
as
part
of
my
half
of
the
forty
thousand
pounds
there
now
and
then
aby
again
waited
for
a
reply
but
now
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
following
quick
upon
the
knock
herbert
entered
the
room
well
father
said
the
son
herbert
yes
father
and
he
went
round
and
supported
his
father
on
his
arm
herbert
will
you
tell
that
man
to
go
come
sir
you
have
disturbed
my
father
enough
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
leave
him
now
i
may
chance
to
disturb
him
more
and
you
too
sir
if
you
treat
me
in
that
way
let
go
my
arm
sir
am
i
to
have
any
answer
from
you
sir
thomas
but
sir
thomas
could
make
no
further
attempt
at
speaking
he
was
now
once
more
seated
in
his
chair
holding
his
son
hand
and
when
he
again
heard
mollett
voice
he
merely
made
a
sign
for
him
to
go
you
see
the
state
my
father
is
in
mollett
said
herbert
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
nature
of
your
business
but
whatever
it
may
be
you
must
leave
him
now
and
he
made
a
slight
attempt
to
push
the
visitor
towards
the
door
you
better
take
care
what
you
doing
fitzgerald
said
mollett
by
you
had
if
you
anger
me
i
might
say
a
word
that
i
could
unsay
again
which
would
put
you
into
queer
street
i
can
tell
you
do
quarrel
with
him
my
boy
pray
do
quarrel
with
him
but
let
him
leave
me
said
sir
thomas
mollett
you
see
my
father
state
you
must
be
aware
that
it
is
imperative
that
he
should
be
left
alone
i
do
know
nothing
about
that
young
business
is
business
and
i
hai
got
hany
answer
to
my
proposals
sir
thomas
do
you
say
to
them
proposals
but
sir
thomas
was
still
dumb
to
all
but
the
last
come
continued
aby
that
was
put
in
quite
as
much
for
your
good
as
it
was
for
mine
but
not
a
word
came
from
the
baronet
then
i
sha
stir
said
aby
again
seating
himself
then
i
shall
have
the
servants
in
said
herbert
and
a
magistrate
who
is
in
the
hall
and
he
put
his
hand
towards
the
handle
of
the
bell
well
as
the
old
hill
i
go
now
and
come
again
but
look
you
here
sir
thomas
you
have
got
my
proposals
and
if
i
get
an
answer
to
them
in
three
days
time
why
you
hear
from
me
in
another
way
that
all
and
so
will
her
ladyship
and
with
this
threat
abraham
mollett
allowed
himself
to
be
conducted
through
the
passage
into
the
hall
and
from
thence
to
his
gig
see
that
he
drives
away
see
that
he
goes
said
herbert
to
somers
who
was
still
staying
about
the
place
oh
i
drive
away
fast
enough
said
aby
as
he
stepped
into
the
gig
and
come
back
fast
enough
too
he
muttered
to
himself
in
the
mean
time
herbert
had
run
back
to
his
father
room
has
he
gone
murmured
sir
thomas
yes
he
has
gone
there
you
can
hear
the
wheels
of
his
gig
on
the
gravel
oh
my
boy
my
poor
boy
what
is
it
father
why
do
you
not
tell
me
why
do
you
allow
such
men
as
that
to
come
and
harass
you
when
a
word
would
keep
them
from
you
father
good
can
not
come
of
it
no
herbert
no
good
will
not
come
of
it
there
is
no
good
to
come
at
all
then
why
will
you
not
tell
us
you
will
know
it
all
soon
enough
but
herbert
do
not
say
a
word
to
your
mother
not
a
word
as
you
value
my
love
let
us
save
her
while
we
can
you
promise
me
that
herbert
gave
him
the
required
promise
look
here
and
he
took
up
the
letter
which
he
had
before
crumpled
in
his
hand
prendergast
will
be
here
next
week
i
shall
tell
everything
to
him
soon
afterwards
sir
thomas
went
to
his
bed
and
there
by
his
bedside
his
wife
sat
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
but
he
said
no
word
to
her
of
his
sorrow
prendergast
is
coming
here
said
herbert
to
somers
i
am
glad
of
it
though
i
do
not
know
him
said
somers
for
my
dear
boy
it
is
necessary
that
there
should
be
some
one
here
chapter
xvi
the
path
beneath
the
elms
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
the
last
chapter
but
one
owen
fitzgerald
left
lady
desmond
in
the
at
desmond
court
somewhat
abruptly
having
absolutely
refused
to
make
peace
with
the
desmond
faction
by
giving
his
consent
to
the
marriage
between
clara
and
his
cousin
herbert
and
it
will
perhaps
be
remembered
also
that
lady
desmond
had
asked
for
this
consent
in
a
manner
that
was
almost
humble
she
had
shown
herself
most
anxious
to
keep
on
friendly
terms
with
the
rake
of
hap
house
rake
and
rou√©
gambler
and
spendthrift
as
he
was
reputed
to
be
if
only
he
would
abandon
his
insane
claim
to
the
hand
of
clara
desmond
but
this
feeling
she
had
shown
when
they
two
were
alone
together
after
clara
had
left
them
as
long
as
her
daughter
had
been
present
lady
desmond
had
maintained
her
tone
of
indignation
and
defiance
but
when
the
door
was
closed
and
they
two
were
alone
she
had
become
kind
in
her
language
and
almost
tender
my
readers
will
probably
conceive
that
she
had
so
acted
overcome
by
her
affection
for
owen
fitzgerald
and
with
a
fixed
resolve
to
win
him
for
herself
men
and
women
when
they
are
written
about
are
always
supposed
to
have
fixed
resolves
though
in
life
they
are
so
seldom
found
to
be
thus
armed
to
speak
the
truth
the
countess
had
had
no
fixed
resolve
in
the
matter
either
when
she
had
thought
about
coming
or
when
subsequently
she
had
found
herself
alone
with
him
in
her
that
clara
should
not
marry
him
on
so
much
she
had
resolved
long
ago
but
all
danger
on
that
head
was
it
may
be
said
over
clara
like
a
good
child
had
behaved
in
the
best
possible
manner
had
abandoned
her
first
lover
a
lover
that
was
poor
and
unfitted
for
her
as
soon
as
told
to
do
so
and
had
found
for
herself
a
second
lover
who
was
rich
and
proper
and
in
every
way
desirable
as
regards
clara
the
countess
felt
herself
to
be
safe
and
to
give
her
her
due
she
had
been
satisfied
that
the
matter
should
so
rest
she
had
not
sought
any
further
interview
with
fitzgerald
he
had
come
there
against
her
advice
and
she
had
gone
to
meet
him
prompted
by
the
necessity
of
supporting
her
daughter
and
without
any
other
views
of
her
own
but
when
she
found
herself
alone
with
him
when
she
looked
into
his
face
and
saw
how
handsome
how
noble
how
good
it
was
good
in
its
inherent
manliness
and
bravery
she
could
not
but
long
that
this
feud
should
be
over
and
that
she
might
be
able
once
more
to
welcome
him
as
her
friend
if
only
he
would
give
up
this
frantic
passion
this
futile
wicked
senseless
attempt
to
make
them
all
wretched
by
an
insane
marriage
would
it
not
be
sweet
again
to
make
some
effort
to
rescue
him
from
the
evil
ways
into
which
he
had
fallen
but
owen
himself
would
make
no
response
to
this
feeling
clara
desmond
was
his
love
and
he
would
of
his
own
consent
yield
her
to
no
one
in
truth
he
was
in
a
certain
degree
mad
on
this
subject
he
did
think
that
because
the
young
girl
had
given
him
a
promise
had
said
to
him
a
word
or
two
which
he
called
a
promise
she
was
now
of
right
his
bride
that
there
belonged
to
him
an
indefeasible
property
in
her
heart
in
her
loveliness
in
the
inexpressible
tenderness
of
her
young
springing
beauty
of
which
no
subsequent
renouncing
on
her
part
could
fairly
and
honestly
deprive
him
that
others
should
oppose
the
match
was
intelligible
to
him
but
it
was
hardly
intelligible
that
she
should
betray
him
and
as
yet
he
did
not
believe
that
she
herself
was
the
mainspring
of
this
renouncing
others
the
countess
and
the
castle
richmond
people
had
frightened
her
into
falseness
and
therefore
it
became
him
to
maintain
his
right
by
any
means
almost
by
any
means
within
his
power
give
her
up
of
his
own
free
will
and
voice
say
that
herbert
fitzgerald
should
take
her
with
his
consent
that
she
should
go
as
a
bride
to
castle
richmond
while
he
stood
by
and
smiled
and
wished
them
joy
never
and
so
he
rode
away
with
a
stern
heart
leaving
her
standing
there
with
something
of
sternness
about
her
heart
also
in
the
meantime
clara
when
she
was
sure
that
her
rejected
suitor
was
well
away
from
the
place
put
on
her
bonnet
and
walked
out
it
was
her
wont
at
this
time
to
do
so
and
she
was
becoming
almost
a
creature
of
habit
shut
up
as
she
was
in
that
old
dreary
barrack
her
mother
very
rarely
went
with
her
and
she
habitually
performed
the
same
journey
over
the
same
ground
at
the
same
hour
day
after
day
so
it
had
been
and
so
it
was
still
unless
herbert
fitzgerald
were
with
her
on
the
present
occasion
she
saw
no
more
of
her
mother
before
she
left
the
house
she
passed
the
door
and
seeing
that
it
was
ajar
knew
that
the
countess
was
there
but
she
had
nothing
to
say
to
her
mother
as
to
the
late
interview
unless
her
mother
had
aught
to
say
to
her
so
she
passed
on
in
truth
her
mother
had
nothing
to
say
to
her
she
was
sitting
there
alone
with
her
head
resting
on
her
hand
with
that
sternness
at
her
heart
and
a
cloud
upon
her
brow
but
she
was
not
thinking
of
her
daughter
had
she
not
with
her
skill
and
motherly
care
provided
well
for
clara
had
she
not
saved
her
daughter
from
all
the
perils
which
beset
the
path
of
a
young
girl
had
she
not
so
brought
her
child
up
and
put
her
forth
into
the
world
that
portionless
as
that
child
was
all
the
best
things
of
the
world
had
been
showered
into
her
lap
why
should
the
countess
think
more
of
her
daughter
it
was
of
herself
she
was
thinking
and
of
what
her
life
would
be
all
alone
absolutely
alone
in
that
huge
frightful
home
of
hers
without
a
friend
almost
without
an
acquaintance
without
one
soul
near
her
whom
she
could
love
or
who
would
love
her
she
had
put
out
her
hand
to
owen
fitzgerald
and
he
had
rejected
it
her
he
had
regarded
merely
as
the
mother
of
the
woman
he
loved
and
then
the
countess
of
desmond
began
to
ask
herself
if
she
were
old
and
wrinkled
and
ugly
only
fit
to
be
a
dowager
in
mind
body
and
in
name
over
the
same
ground
yes
always
over
the
same
ground
lady
clara
never
varied
her
walk
it
went
from
the
front
entrance
of
the
court
with
one
great
curve
down
to
the
old
ruined
lodge
which
opened
on
to
the
road
running
from
kanturk
to
cork
it
was
here
that
the
row
of
elm
trees
stood
and
it
was
here
that
she
had
once
walked
with
a
hot
eager
lover
beside
her
while
a
docile
horse
followed
behind
their
feet
it
was
here
that
she
walked
daily
and
was
it
possible
that
she
should
walk
here
without
thinking
of
him
it
was
always
on
the
little
path
by
the
not
on
the
road
itself
that
she
took
her
measured
exercise
and
now
as
she
went
along
she
saw
on
the
moist
earth
the
fresh
prints
of
a
hoofs
he
also
had
ridden
down
the
same
way
choosing
to
pass
over
the
absolute
spot
in
which
those
words
had
been
uttered
thinking
of
that
moment
as
she
also
was
thinking
of
it
she
felt
sure
that
such
had
been
the
case
she
knew
that
it
was
this
that
had
brought
him
there
there
on
to
the
which
they
had
made
together
and
did
he
then
love
her
so
truly
with
a
love
so
hot
so
eager
so
deeply
planted
in
his
very
soul
was
it
really
true
that
a
passion
for
her
had
so
filled
his
heart
that
his
whole
life
must
by
that
be
made
or
marred
had
she
done
this
thing
to
him
had
she
so
impressed
her
image
on
his
mind
that
he
must
be
wretched
without
her
was
she
so
much
to
him
so
completely
all
in
all
as
regarded
his
future
worldly
happiness
those
words
of
his
asserting
that
love
her
love
was
to
him
a
stern
fact
a
deep
necessity
recurred
over
and
over
again
to
her
mind
could
it
really
be
that
in
doing
as
she
had
done
in
giving
herself
to
another
after
she
had
promised
herself
to
him
she
had
committed
an
injustice
which
would
constantly
be
brought
up
against
her
by
him
and
by
her
own
conscience
had
she
in
truth
deceived
and
betrayed
him
deserted
him
because
he
was
poor
and
given
herself
over
to
a
rich
lover
because
of
his
riches
as
she
thought
of
this
she
forgot
again
that
fact
which
indeed
she
had
never
more
than
half
realized
in
her
mind
that
he
had
justified
her
in
separating
herself
from
him
by
his
reckless
course
of
living
that
his
conduct
must
be
held
to
have
so
justified
her
let
the
pledge
between
them
have
been
of
what
nature
it
might
now
as
she
walked
up
and
down
that
path
she
thought
nothing
of
his
wickedness
and
his
sins
she
thought
only
of
the
vows
to
which
she
had
once
listened
and
the
renewal
of
those
vows
to
which
it
was
now
so
necessary
that
her
ear
should
be
deaf
but
was
her
heart
deaf
to
them
she
swore
to
herself
over
and
over
again
scores
and
scores
of
oaths
that
it
was
so
but
each
time
that
she
swore
some
lowest
corner
in
the
depth
of
her
conscience
seemed
to
charge
her
with
a
falsehood
why
was
it
that
in
all
her
hours
of
thinking
she
so
much
oftener
saw
his
face
owen
than
she
did
that
other
face
of
which
in
duty
she
was
bound
to
think
and
dream
it
was
in
vain
that
she
told
herself
that
she
was
afraid
of
owen
and
therefore
thought
of
him
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
rang
in
her
ears
the
oftenest
was
not
that
of
his
anger
and
sternness
but
the
tone
of
his
first
assurance
of
love
that
tone
which
had
been
so
inexpressibly
sweet
to
her
that
to
which
she
had
listened
on
this
very
spot
where
she
now
walked
slowly
thinking
of
him
the
look
of
his
which
was
ever
present
to
her
eyes
was
not
that
on
which
she
had
almost
feared
to
gaze
but
an
hour
ago
but
the
form
and
spirit
which
his
countenance
had
worn
when
they
were
together
on
that
day
and
then
she
would
think
or
try
to
think
of
herbert
and
of
all
his
virtues
and
of
all
his
goodness
he
too
loved
her
well
she
never
doubted
that
he
had
come
to
her
with
soft
words
and
pleasant
smiles
and
sweet
honeyed
compliments
compliments
which
had
been
sweet
to
her
as
they
are
to
all
girls
but
his
soft
words
and
pleasant
smiles
and
honeyed
had
never
given
her
so
strong
a
thrill
of
strange
delight
as
had
those
few
words
from
owen
her
very
heart
core
had
been
affected
by
the
vigour
of
his
affection
there
had
been
in
it
a
mysterious
grandeur
which
had
half
charmed
and
half
frightened
her
it
had
made
her
feel
that
he
were
it
fated
that
she
should
belong
to
him
would
indeed
be
her
lord
and
ruler
that
his
was
a
spirit
before
which
hers
would
bend
and
feel
itself
subdued
with
him
she
could
realize
all
that
she
had
dreamed
of
woman
love
and
that
dream
which
is
so
sweet
to
some
women
of
woman
subjugation
but
could
it
be
the
same
with
him
to
whom
she
was
now
positively
affianced
with
him
to
whom
she
knew
that
she
did
now
owe
all
her
duty
she
feared
that
it
was
not
the
same
and
then
again
she
swore
that
she
loved
him
she
thought
over
all
his
excellences
how
good
he
was
as
a
son
how
fondly
his
sisters
loved
him
how
inimitable
was
his
conduct
in
these
hard
trying
times
and
she
remembered
also
that
it
was
right
in
every
way
that
she
should
love
him
her
mother
and
brother
approved
of
it
those
who
were
to
be
her
new
relatives
approved
of
it
it
was
in
every
way
fitting
pecuniary
considerations
were
so
favourable
but
when
she
thought
of
that
her
heart
sank
low
within
her
breast
was
it
true
that
she
had
sold
herself
at
her
mother
bidding
should
not
the
remembrance
of
owen
poverty
have
made
her
true
to
him
had
nothing
else
done
so
but
be
all
that
as
it
might
one
thing
at
any
rate
was
clear
to
her
that
it
was
now
her
fate
her
duty
and
as
she
repeated
again
and
again
her
wish
to
marry
herbert
no
thought
of
rebellion
against
him
and
her
mother
ever
occurred
to
her
as
desirable
or
possible
she
would
be
to
him
a
true
and
loving
wife
a
wife
in
very
heart
and
soul
but
nevertheless
walking
thus
beneath
those
trees
she
could
not
but
think
of
owen
fitzgerald
in
this
mood
she
had
gone
twice
down
from
the
house
to
the
lodge
and
back
again
and
now
again
she
had
reached
the
lodge
the
third
time
making
thus
her
last
journey
for
in
these
solitary
walks
her
work
was
measured
the
exercise
was
needful
but
there
was
little
in
the
task
to
make
her
prolong
it
beyond
what
was
necessary
but
now
as
she
was
turning
for
the
last
time
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
hoof
coming
fast
along
the
road
and
looking
from
the
gate
she
saw
that
herbert
was
coming
to
her
she
had
not
expected
him
but
now
she
waited
at
the
gate
to
meet
him
it
had
been
arranged
that
she
was
to
go
over
in
a
few
days
to
castle
richmond
and
stay
there
for
a
fortnight
this
had
been
settled
shortly
before
the
visit
made
by
mollett
junior
at
that
place
and
had
not
as
yet
been
unsettled
but
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
sir
thomas
had
summoned
prendergast
from
london
it
was
felt
by
them
all
that
it
would
be
as
well
that
clara
visit
should
be
postponed
herbert
had
been
especially
cautioned
by
his
father
at
the
time
of
mollett
visit
not
to
tell
his
mother
anything
of
what
had
occurred
and
to
a
certain
extent
he
had
kept
his
promise
but
it
was
of
course
necessary
that
lady
fitzgerald
should
know
that
prendergast
was
coming
to
the
house
and
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
keep
from
her
the
fact
that
his
visit
was
connected
with
the
lamentable
state
of
her
husband
health
and
spirits
indeed
she
knew
as
much
as
that
without
any
telling
it
was
not
probable
that
prendergast
should
come
there
now
on
a
visit
of
pleasure
whatever
this
may
be
that
weighs
upon
his
mind
herbert
had
said
he
will
be
better
for
talking
it
over
with
a
man
whom
he
trusts
and
why
not
with
somers
said
lady
fitzgerald
somers
is
too
often
with
him
too
near
to
him
in
all
the
affairs
of
his
life
i
really
think
he
is
wise
to
send
for
prendergast
we
do
not
know
him
but
i
believe
him
to
be
a
good
man
then
lady
fitzgerald
had
expressed
herself
as
satisfied
as
satisfied
as
she
could
be
seeing
that
her
husband
would
not
take
her
into
his
confidence
and
after
this
it
was
settled
that
herbert
should
at
once
ride
over
to
desmond
court
and
explain
that
clara
visit
had
better
be
postponed
herbert
got
off
his
horse
at
the
gate
and
gave
it
to
one
of
the
children
at
the
lodge
to
lead
after
him
his
horse
would
not
follow
him
clara
said
to
herself
as
they
walked
back
together
towards
the
house
she
could
not
prevent
her
mind
running
off
in
that
direction
she
would
fain
not
have
thought
of
owen
as
she
thus
hung
upon
herbert
arm
but
as
yet
she
had
not
learned
to
control
her
thoughts
his
horse
had
followed
him
lovingly
the
dogs
about
the
place
had
always
loved
him
the
men
and
women
of
the
whole
country
round
old
and
young
all
spoke
of
him
with
a
sort
of
love
everybody
admired
him
as
all
this
passed
through
her
brain
she
was
hanging
on
her
accepted
lover
arm
and
listening
to
his
soft
sweet
words
oh
yes
it
will
be
much
better
she
said
answering
his
proposal
that
she
should
put
off
her
visit
to
castle
richmond
but
i
am
so
sorry
that
sir
thomas
should
be
prendergast
is
not
a
doctor
is
he
and
then
herbert
explained
that
prendergast
was
not
a
doctor
that
he
was
a
physician
for
the
mind
rather
than
for
the
body
regarding
clara
as
already
one
of
his
own
family
he
told
her
as
much
as
he
had
told
his
mother
he
explained
that
there
was
some
deep
sorrow
weighing
on
his
father
heart
of
which
they
none
of
them
knew
anything
save
its
existence
that
there
might
be
some
misfortune
coming
on
sir
thomas
of
which
he
herbert
could
not
even
guess
the
nature
but
that
everything
would
be
told
to
this
prendergast
it
is
very
sad
said
herbert
very
sad
very
sad
said
clara
with
tears
in
her
eyes
poor
gentleman
i
wish
that
we
could
comfort
him
and
i
do
hope
that
we
may
said
herbert
somers
seems
to
think
that
his
mind
is
partly
affected
and
that
this
misfortune
whatever
it
be
may
not
improbably
be
less
serious
than
we
anticipate
that
it
weighs
heavier
on
him
than
it
would
do
were
he
altogether
well
and
your
mother
herbert
oh
yes
she
also
is
to
be
pitied
sometimes
for
moments
she
seems
to
dread
some
terrible
misfortune
but
i
believe
that
in
her
calm
judgment
she
thinks
that
our
worst
calamity
is
the
state
of
my
father
health
neither
in
discussing
the
matter
with
his
mother
or
clara
nor
in
thinking
it
over
when
alone
did
it
ever
occur
to
herbert
that
he
himself
might
be
individually
subject
to
the
misfortune
over
which
his
father
brooded
sir
thomas
had
spoken
piteously
to
him
and
called
him
poor
and
had
seemed
to
grieve
over
what
might
happen
to
him
but
this
had
been
taken
by
the
son
as
a
part
of
his
malady
everything
around
him
was
now
melancholy
and
therefore
these
terms
had
not
seemed
to
have
any
special
force
of
their
own
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
warn
clara
that
bad
days
might
be
in
store
for
both
of
them
or
to
caution
her
that
their
path
of
love
might
yet
be
made
rough
and
whom
do
you
think
i
met
just
now
on
horseback
he
asked
as
soon
as
this
question
of
her
visit
had
been
decided
owen
fitzgerald
probably
said
clara
he
went
from
hence
about
an
hour
since
owen
fitzgerald
here
he
repeated
as
though
the
tidings
of
such
a
visit
having
been
made
were
not
exactly
pleasant
to
him
i
thought
that
lady
desmond
did
not
even
see
him
now
his
visit
was
to
me
herbert
and
i
will
explain
it
to
you
i
was
just
going
to
tell
you
when
you
first
came
in
only
you
began
about
castle
richmond
and
have
you
seen
him
oh
yes
i
saw
him
mamma
thought
it
best
yesterday
he
wrote
a
note
to
me
which
i
will
show
you
and
then
she
gave
him
such
an
account
of
the
interview
as
was
possible
to
her
making
it
at
any
rate
intelligible
to
him
that
owen
had
come
thither
to
claim
her
for
himself
having
heard
the
rumour
of
her
engagement
to
his
cousin
it
was
inexcusable
on
his
part
unpardonable
said
herbert
speaking
with
an
angry
spot
on
his
face
and
with
more
energy
than
was
usual
with
him
was
it
why
said
clara
innocently
she
felt
unconsciously
that
it
was
painful
to
her
to
hear
owen
ill
spoken
of
by
her
lover
and
that
she
would
fain
excuse
him
if
she
could
why
dearest
think
what
motives
he
could
have
had
what
other
object
than
to
place
you
in
a
painful
position
and
to
cause
trouble
and
vexation
to
us
all
did
he
not
know
that
we
were
engaged
oh
yes
he
knew
that
at
least
no
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
think
he
said
that
he
had
heard
it
but
did
not
did
not
what
love
i
think
he
said
he
did
not
quite
believe
it
and
then
she
was
forced
much
against
her
will
to
describe
to
her
betrothed
how
owen
had
boldly
claimed
her
as
his
own
his
conduct
has
been
unpardonable
said
herbert
again
nay
it
has
been
ungentlemanlike
he
has
intruded
himself
where
he
well
knew
that
he
was
not
wanted
and
he
has
done
so
taking
advantage
of
a
few
words
which
under
the
present
circumstances
he
should
force
himself
to
forget
but
herbert
it
is
i
that
have
been
to
blame
no
you
have
not
been
in
the
least
to
blame
i
tell
you
honestly
that
i
can
lay
no
blame
at
your
door
at
the
age
you
were
then
it
was
impossible
that
you
should
know
your
own
mind
and
even
had
your
promise
to
him
been
of
a
much
more
binding
nature
his
subsequent
conduct
and
your
mother
remonstrance
as
well
as
your
own
age
would
have
released
you
from
it
without
any
taint
of
falsehood
he
knew
all
this
as
well
as
i
do
and
i
am
surprised
that
he
should
have
forced
his
way
into
your
mother
house
with
the
mere
object
of
causing
you
embarrassment
it
was
marvellous
how
well
herbert
fitzgerald
could
lay
down
the
law
on
the
subject
of
clara
conduct
and
on
all
that
was
due
to
her
and
all
that
was
not
due
to
owen
he
was
the
victor
he
had
gained
the
prize
and
therefore
it
was
so
easy
for
him
to
acquit
his
promised
bride
and
heap
reproaches
on
the
head
of
his
rejected
rival
owen
had
been
told
that
he
was
not
wanted
and
of
course
should
have
been
satisfied
with
his
answer
why
should
he
intrude
himself
among
happy
people
with
his
absurd
aspirations
for
were
they
not
absurd
was
it
not
monstrous
on
his
part
to
suppose
that
he
could
marry
clara
desmond
it
was
in
this
way
that
herbert
regarded
the
matter
but
it
was
not
exactly
in
that
way
that
clara
looked
at
it
he
did
not
force
his
way
in
she
said
he
wrote
to
ask
if
we
would
see
him
and
mamma
said
that
she
thought
it
better
that
is
forcing
his
way
in
the
sense
that
i
meant
it
and
if
i
find
that
he
gives
further
annoyance
i
shall
tell
him
what
i
think
about
it
i
will
not
have
you
persecuted
herbert
if
you
quarrel
with
him
you
will
make
me
wretched
i
think
it
would
kill
me
i
shall
not
do
it
if
i
can
help
it
clara
but
it
is
my
duty
to
protect
you
and
if
it
becomes
necessary
i
must
do
so
you
have
no
father
and
no
brother
of
an
age
to
speak
to
him
and
that
consideration
alone
should
have
saved
you
from
such
an
attack
clara
said
nothing
more
for
she
knew
that
she
could
not
speak
out
to
him
the
feelings
of
her
heart
she
could
not
plead
to
him
that
she
had
injured
owen
that
she
had
loved
him
and
then
given
him
up
that
she
had
been
false
to
him
she
could
not
confess
that
after
all
the
tribute
of
such
a
man
love
could
not
be
regarded
by
her
as
an
offence
so
she
said
nothing
further
but
walked
on
in
silence
leaning
on
his
arm
they
were
now
close
to
the
house
and
as
they
drew
near
to
it
lady
desmond
met
them
on
the
i
dare
say
you
have
heard
that
we
had
a
visitor
here
this
morning
she
said
taking
herbert
hand
in
an
affectionate
motherly
way
and
smiling
on
him
with
all
her
sweetness
herbert
said
that
he
had
heard
it
and
expressed
an
opinion
that
owen
fitzgerald
would
have
been
acting
far
more
wisely
to
have
remained
at
home
at
hap
house
yes
perhaps
so
certainly
so
said
lady
desmond
putting
her
arm
within
that
of
her
future
son
and
walking
back
with
him
through
the
great
hall
he
would
have
been
wiser
he
would
have
saved
dear
clara
from
a
painful
and
he
would
have
saved
himself
from
perhaps
years
of
sorrow
he
has
been
very
foolish
to
remember
childhood
as
he
does
remember
it
but
my
dear
herbert
what
can
we
do
you
lords
of
creation
sometimes
will
be
foolish
even
about
such
trifling
things
as
women
hearts
and
then
when
herbert
still
persisted
that
owen
conduct
had
been
inexcusable
and
ungentlemanlike
she
softly
flattered
him
into
quiescence
you
must
not
forget
she
said
that
he
perhaps
has
loved
clara
almost
as
truly
as
you
do
and
then
what
harm
can
he
do
it
is
not
very
probable
that
he
should
succeed
in
winning
clara
away
from
you
oh
no
it
is
not
that
i
mean
it
is
for
clara
sake
and
she
probably
will
never
see
him
again
till
she
is
your
wife
that
event
will
i
suppose
take
place
at
no
very
remote
period
as
soon
as
ever
my
father
health
will
admit
that
is
if
i
can
persuade
clara
to
be
so
merciful
to
tell
the
truth
herbert
i
think
you
could
persuade
her
to
anything
of
course
we
must
not
hurry
her
too
much
as
for
me
my
losing
her
will
be
very
sad
you
can
understand
that
but
i
would
not
allow
any
feeling
of
my
own
to
stand
in
her
way
for
she
will
be
very
near
you
you
know
yes
she
will
and
therefore
as
i
was
saying
it
would
be
absurd
for
you
to
quarrel
with
owen
fitzgerald
for
myself
i
am
sorry
for
him
very
sorry
for
him
you
know
the
whole
story
of
what
occurred
between
him
and
clara
and
of
course
you
will
understand
that
my
duty
at
that
time
was
plain
clara
behaved
admirably
and
if
only
he
would
not
be
so
foolish
the
whole
matter
might
be
forgotten
as
far
as
you
and
i
are
concerned
i
think
it
may
be
forgotten
but
then
his
coming
here
that
will
not
be
repeated
i
thought
it
better
to
show
him
that
we
were
not
afraid
of
him
and
therefore
i
permitted
it
had
i
conceived
that
you
would
have
objected
oh
no
said
herbert
well
there
was
not
much
for
you
to
be
afraid
of
certainly
said
the
countess
and
so
he
was
appeased
and
left
the
house
promising
that
he
at
any
rate
would
do
nothing
that
might
lead
to
a
quarrel
with
his
cousin
owen
clara
who
had
still
kept
on
her
bonnet
again
walked
down
with
him
to
the
lodge
and
encountered
his
first
earnest
supplication
that
an
early
day
should
be
named
for
their
marriage
she
had
many
reasons
excellent
good
reasons
to
allege
why
this
should
not
be
the
case
when
was
a
girl
of
seventeen
without
such
reasons
and
it
is
so
reasonable
that
she
should
have
such
reasons
that
period
of
having
love
made
to
her
must
be
by
far
the
brightest
in
her
life
is
it
not
always
a
pity
that
it
should
be
abridged
but
your
father
illness
herbert
you
know
herbert
acknowledged
that
to
a
certain
extent
his
father
illness
was
a
reason
only
to
a
certain
extent
it
would
be
worse
than
useless
to
think
of
waiting
till
his
father
health
should
be
altogether
strong
just
for
the
present
till
prendergast
should
have
gone
and
perhaps
for
a
fortnight
longer
it
might
be
well
to
wait
but
after
that
and
then
he
pressed
very
closely
the
hand
which
rested
on
his
arm
and
so
the
matter
was
discussed
between
them
with
language
and
arguments
which
were
by
no
means
original
at
the
gate
just
as
herbert
was
about
to
remount
his
horse
they
were
encountered
by
a
sight
which
for
years
past
had
not
been
uncommon
in
the
south
of
ireland
but
which
had
become
frightfully
common
during
the
last
two
or
three
months
a
woman
was
standing
there
of
whom
you
could
hardly
say
that
she
was
clothed
though
she
was
involved
in
a
mass
of
rags
which
covered
her
nakedness
her
head
was
all
uncovered
and
her
wild
black
hair
was
streaming
round
her
face
behind
her
back
hung
two
children
enveloped
among
the
rags
in
some
mysterious
way
and
round
about
her
on
the
road
stood
three
others
of
whom
the
two
younger
were
almost
absolutely
naked
the
eldest
of
the
five
was
not
above
seven
they
all
had
the
same
wild
black
eyes
and
wild
elfish
straggling
locks
but
neither
the
mother
nor
the
children
were
comely
she
was
short
and
broad
in
the
shoulders
though
wretchedly
thin
her
bare
legs
seemed
to
be
of
nearly
the
same
thickness
up
to
the
knee
and
the
naked
limbs
of
the
children
were
like
yellow
sticks
it
is
strange
how
various
are
the
kinds
of
physical
development
among
the
celtic
peasantry
in
ireland
in
many
places
they
are
singularly
beautiful
especially
as
children
and
even
after
labour
and
sickness
shall
have
told
on
them
as
labour
and
sickness
will
tell
they
still
retain
a
certain
softness
and
grace
which
is
very
nearly
akin
to
beauty
but
then
again
in
a
neighbouring
district
they
will
be
found
to
be
squat
uncouth
and
in
no
way
attractive
to
the
eye
the
tint
of
the
complexion
the
nature
of
the
hair
the
colour
of
the
eyes
shall
be
the
same
but
in
one
place
it
will
seem
as
though
noble
blood
had
produced
delicate
limbs
and
elegant
stature
whereas
in
the
other
a
want
of
noble
blood
had
produced
the
reverse
the
peasants
of
clare
limerick
and
tipperary
are
in
this
way
much
more
comely
than
those
of
cork
and
kerry
when
herbert
and
clara
reached
the
gate
they
found
this
mother
with
her
five
children
crouching
at
the
although
it
was
still
they
had
seen
him
enter
the
demesne
and
were
now
waiting
with
the
patience
of
poverty
for
his
return
an
the
holy
virgin
guide
an
save
you
my
lady
said
the
woman
almost
frightening
clara
by
the
sudden
way
in
which
she
came
forward
an
you
too
misther
herbert
and
for
the
love
of
heaven
do
something
for
a
poor
crathur
whose
five
starving
childher
have
not
had
wholesome
food
within
their
lips
for
the
last
week
past
clara
looked
at
them
piteously
and
put
her
hand
towards
her
pocket
her
purse
was
never
well
furnished
and
now
in
these
bad
days
was
usually
empty
at
the
present
moment
it
was
wholly
so
i
have
nothing
to
give
her
not
a
penny
she
said
whispering
to
her
lover
but
herbert
had
learned
deep
lessons
of
political
economy
and
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
give
promiscuous
charity
on
the
what
is
your
name
said
he
and
from
where
do
you
come
shure
an
it
yer
honor
knows
me
well
enough
and
her
ladyship
too
may
the
heavens
be
her
bed
and
do
i
come
from
clady

is
two
long
miles
the
fur
side
of
it

about
the
biler
clara
looked
at
her
and
thought
that
she
did
remember
her
but
she
said
nothing
and
who
is
your
husband
said
herbert
murty
brien
plaze
yer
honor
and
the
woman
ducked
a
curtsey
with
the
heavy
load
of
two
children
on
her
back
it
must
be
understood
that
among
the
poorer
classes
in
the
south
and
west
of
ireland
it
is
almost
rare
for
a
married
woman
to
call
herself
or
to
be
called
by
her
husband
name
and
is
he
not
at
work
shure

up
among

people
hoping
that

faix
yer

i
thinking
that

and
what
do

bridget

i

a
sup
of
milk
for
thim
five
childher
as
is
starving
and
dying
for
the
want
of
it
and
she
pointed
to
the
wretched
naked
brood
around
her
with
a
gesture
which
in
spite
of
her
ugliness
had
in
it
something
of
tragic
grandeur
but
you
know
that
we
will
not
give
money
they
will
take
you
in
at
the
poorhouse
at
kanturk
is
it
the

they
will
give

at

that
why
do
you
not
go
to
father
connellan
is
it
the
mail
an
shure
an
have
i
had
it
the
last
month
past
nothin
else
not
a
taste
of
a
piaty
or
a
dhrop
of
milk
for
nigh
a
month
and
now
look
at
the
childher
look
at
them
my
lady
they
are
dyin
by
the
very
and
she
undid
the
bundle
at
her
back
and
laying
the
two
babes
down
on
the
road
showed
that
the
elder
of
them
was
in
truth
in
a
fearful
state
it
was
a
child
nearly
two
years
of
age
but
its
little
legs
seemed
to
have
withered
away
its
cheeks
were
wan
and
yellow
and
sunken
and
the
two
teeth
which
it
had
already
cut
were
seen
with
terrible
plainness
through
its
emaciated
lips
its
head
and
forehead
were
covered
with
sores
and
then
the
mother
moving
aside
the
rags
showed
that
its
back
and
legs
were
in
the
same
state
look
to
that
she
said
almost
with
scorn
what
the
mail
has
done
my
black
curses
be
upon
it
and
the
day
that
it
first
come
nigh
the
counthry
and
then
again
she
covered
the
child
and
began
to
resume
her
load
do
give
her
something
herbert
pray
do
said
clara
with
her
whole
face
suffused
with
tears
you
know
that
we
can
not
give
away
money
said
herbert
arguing
with
bridget
sheehy
and
not
answering
clara
at
the
moment
you
understand
enough
of
what
is
being
done
to
know
that
why
do
you
not
go
into
the
union
shure
thin
an
i
jist
tramp
on
as
fur
as
hap
house
i
and
my
childher
that
is
av
they
do
not
die
by
the
come
on
bairns
owen
wo
be
afther
sending
me
to
the
kanturk
union
when
i
tell
him
that
i
travelled
all
thim
miles
to
get
a
dhrink
of
milk
for
a
sick
babe
more
by
token
when
i
tells
him
also
that
one
of
the
desmond
tinantry
it
he
that
loves
the
desmonds
lady
clara
loves
them
as
his
own
heart

and
it
i
that
wish
him
good
luck
with
his
love
in
spite
of
all
that
come
and
gone
yet
come
on
bairns
come
along
we
have
seven
weary
miles
to
walk
and
then
having
rearranged
her
burden
on
her
back
she
prepared
again
to
start
herbert
fitzgerald
from
the
first
moment
of
his
interrogating
the
woman
had
of
course
known
that
he
would
give
her
somewhat
in
spite
of
all
his
political
economy
there
were
but
few
days
in
which
he
did
not
empty
his
pocket
of
his
loose
silver
with
these
culpable
deviations
from
his
theoretical
philosophy
but
yet
he
felt
that
it
was
his
duty
to
insist
on
his
rules
as
far
as
his
heart
would
allow
him
to
do
so
it
was
a
settled
thing
at
their
relief
committee
that
there
should
be
no
giving
away
of
money
to
chance
applicants
for
alms
what
money
each
had
to
bestow
would
go
twice
further
by
being
brought
to
the
general
fund
by
being
expended
with
forethought
and
discrimination
this
was
the
system
which
all
attempted
which
all
resolved
to
adopt
who
were
then
living
in
the
south
of
ireland
but
the
system
was
impracticable
for
it
required
frames
of
iron
and
hearts
of
adamant
it
was
impossible
not
to
waste
money
in
almsgiving
oh
herbert
said
clara
imploringly
as
the
woman
prepared
to
start
bridget
come
here
said
herbert
and
he
spoke
very
seriously
for
the
woman
allusion
to
owen
fitzgerald
had
driven
a
cloud
across
his
brow
your
child
is
very
ill
and
therefore
i
will
give
you
something
to
help
you
and
he
gave
her
a
shilling
and
two
sixpences
may
the
god
in
heaven
bless
you
thin
and
make
you
happy
whoever
wins
the
bright
darling
by
your
side
and
may
the
good
days
come
back
to
yer
house
and
all
that
belongs
to
it
may
yer
wife
clave
to
you
all
her
days
and
be
a
good
mother
to
your
childher
and
she
would
have
gone
on
further
with
her
blessing
had
not
he
interrupted
her
go
on
now
my
good
woman
said
he
and
take
your
children
where
they
may
be
warm
if
you
will
be
advised
by
me
you
will
go
to
the
union
at
kanturk
and
so
the
woman
passed
on
still
blessing
them
very
shortly
after
this
none
of
them
required
pressing
to
go
to
the
workhouse
every
building
that
could
be
arranged
for
the
purpose
was
filled
to
overflowing
as
soon
as
it
was
ready
but
the
worst
of
the
famine
had
not
come
upon
them
as
yet
and
then
herbert
rode
back
to
castle
richmond
chapter
xvii
father
barney
mick
at
kanturk
was
by
no
means
so
pretentious
an
establishment
as
that
kept
by
his
brother
in
south
main
street
cork
but
it
was
on
the
whole
much
less
nasty
it
was
a
and
a
public
car
office
and
such
places
in
ireland
are
seldom
very
nice
but
there
was
no
attempt
at
hotel
grandeur
and
the
little
room
in
which
the
family
lived
behind
the
bar
was
never
invaded
by
customers
on
one
evening
just
at
this
time
at
the
time
that
is
with
which
we
have
been
lately
concerned
three
persons
were
sitting
in
this
room
over
a
cup
of
tea
there
was
a
gentleman
but
none
the
worse
on
that
account
who
has
already
been
introduced
in
these
pages
as
father
bernard
he
was
the
parish
priest
of
drumbarrow
and
as
his
parish
comprised
a
portion
of
the
town
of
kanturk
he
lived
not
exactly
in
the
town
but
within
a
mile
of
it
his
sister
had
married
of
south
main
street
and
therefore
he
was
quite
at
home
in
the
little
back
parlour
of
mick
house
in
kanturk
indeed
father
bernard
was
a
man
who
made
himself
at
home
in
the
houses
of
most
of
his
parishioners
and
of
some
who
were
not
his
parishioners
his
companions
on
the
present
occasion
were
two
ladies
who
seemed
to
be
emulous
in
supplying
his
wants
the
younger
and
more
attractive
of
the
two
was
also
an
old
friend
of
ours
being
no
other
than
fanny
from
south
main
street
actuated
doubtless
by
some
important
motive
she
had
left
her
bar
at
home
for
one
night
having
come
down
to
kanturk
by
her
father
car
with
the
intention
of
returning
by
it
in
the
morning
she
was
seated
as
a
guest
here
on
the
corner
of
the
sofa
near
the
fire
but
nevertheless
she
was
neither
too
proud
nor
too
strange
in
her
position
to
administer
as
best
she
might
to
the
comfort
of
her
uncle
the
other
lady
was
mistress
the
lady
of
the
mansion
she
was
fat
very
by
no
means
fair
and
perhaps
something
over
forty
but
nevertheless
there
were
those
who
thought
that
she
had
her
charms
a
better
hand
at
curing
a
side
of
bacon
there
was
not
in
the
county
cork
nor
a
woman
who
was
more
knowing
in
keeping
a
house
straight
and
snug
over
her
husband
head
that
she
had
been
worth
more
than
a
fortune
to
mick
was
admitted
by
all
in
kanturk
for
it
was
known
to
all
that
mick
was
not
himself
a
good
hand
at
keeping
a
house
straight
and
snug
another
cup
of
tay
father
bernard
said
this
lady
it
be
more
to
your
liking
now
than
the
first
you
find
father
barney
perfectly
reliant
on
her
word
handed
in
his
cup
and
the
muffin
is
quite
hot
said
fanny
stooping
down
to
a
tray
which
stood
before
the
peat
fire
holding
the
muffin
dish
but
perhaps
you
like
a
morsel
of
buttered
toast
say
the
word
uncle
and
i
make
it
in
a
brace
of
seconds
in
course
she
will
said
and
happy
too
av
only
say
that
you
have
a
fancy
father
bernard
but
father
bernard
would
not
own
to
any
such
fancy
the
muffin
he
said
was
quite
to
his
liking
and
so
was
the
tea
and
from
the
manner
in
which
he
disposed
of
these
delicacies
even
townsend
might
have
admitted
that
this
assertion
was
true
though
she
was
wont
to
express
her
belief
that
nothing
but
lies
could
by
any
possibility
fall
from
his
mouth
and
they
have
been
staying
with
you
now
for
some
weeks
they
said
father
barney
off
and
on
said
fanny
but
there
one
of
them
mostly
there
is
he
added
the
priest
the
two
of
them
is
mostly
there
just
now
sometimes
one
goes
away
for
a
day
or
two
and
sometimes
the
other
and
they
have
no
business
which
keeps
them
in
cork
continued
the
priest
who
seemed
to
be
very
curious
on
the
matter
well
they
do
have
business
i
suppose
said
fanny
but
av
so
i
never
sees
it
fanny
had
a
great
respect
for
her
uncle
seeing
that
he
filled
an
exalted
position
and
was
a
connexion
of
whom
she
could
be
justly
proud
but
though
she
had
now
come
down
to
kanturk
with
the
view
of
having
a
good
talk
with
her
aunt
and
uncle
about
the
molletts
she
would
only
tell
as
much
as
she
liked
to
tell
even
to
the
parish
priest
of
drumbarrow
and
we
may
as
well
explain
here
that
fanny
had
now
permanently
made
up
her
mind
to
reject
the
suit
of
abraham
mollett
as
she
had
allowed
herself
to
see
more
and
more
of
the
little
domestic
ways
of
that
gentleman
and
to
become
intimate
with
him
as
a
girl
should
become
with
the
man
she
intends
to
marry
she
had
gradually
learned
to
think
that
he
hardly
came
up
to
her
beau
ideal
of
a
lover
that
he
was
crafty
and
false
did
not
perhaps
offend
her
as
it
should
have
done
dear
fanny
excellent
and
gracious
as
she
was
could
herself
be
crafty
on
occasions
he
drank
too
but
that
came
in
the
way
of
her
profession
it
is
hard
perhaps
for
a
barmaid
to
feel
much
severity
against
that
offence
but
in
addition
to
this
aby
was
selfish
and
cruel
and
insolent
and
seldom
altogether
good
tempered
he
was
bad
to
his
father
and
bad
to
those
below
him
whom
he
employed
old
mollett
would
give
away
his
sixpences
with
a
fairly
liberal
hand
unless
when
he
was
exasperated
by
drink
and
fatigue
but
aby
seldom
gave
away
a
penny
fanny
had
sharp
eyes
and
soon
felt
that
her
english
lover
was
not
a
man
to
be
loved
though
he
had
two
rings
a
gold
chain
and
half
a
dozen
fine
waistcoats
and
then
another
offence
had
come
to
light
in
which
the
molletts
were
both
concerned
since
their
arrival
in
south
main
street
they
had
been
excellent
customers
indeed
quite
a
godsend
in
this
light
to
fanny
who
had
her
own
peculiar
profit
out
of
such
as
they
were
they
had
paid
their
money
like
true
britons
not
regularly
indeed
for
regularity
had
not
been
desired
but
by
a
five
pound
now
and
another
in
a
day
or
two
just
as
they
were
wanted
nothing
indeed
could
be
better
than
this
for
bills
so
paid
are
seldom
rigidly
scrutinized
but
of
late
within
the
last
week
fanny
requests
for
funds
had
not
been
so
promptly
met
and
only
on
the
day
before
her
visit
to
kanturk
she
had
been
forced
to
get
her
father
to
take
a
bill
from
mollett
senior
for
at
two
date
this
was
a
great
as
both
fanny
and
her
father
felt
and
they
had
begun
to
think
that
it
might
be
well
to
bring
their
connexion
with
the
molletts
to
a
close
what
if
an
end
had
come
to
the
money
of
these
people
and
their
bills
should
be
dishonoured
when
due
it
was
all
very
well
for
a
man
to
have
claims
against
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
but
fanny
had
already
learnt
that
nothing
goes
so
far
in
this
world
as
ready
cash
they
do
have
business
i
suppose
said
fanny
it
wo
be
worth
much
i
thinking
said
when
they
ca
pay
their
weekly
bills
at
a
house
of
public
entertainment
without
flying
their
names
at
two
months
date
hated
any
such
payments
herself
and
looked
on
them
as
certain
signs
of
immorality
that
every
man
should
take
his
drop
of
drink
consume
it
noiselessly
and
pay
for
it
immediately
that
was
her
idea
of
propriety
in
its
highest
form
and
they
been
down
here
three
or
four
times
each
of
them
said
father
barney
thinking
deeply
on
the
subject
i
believe
they
have
said
fanny
but
of
course
i
do
know
much
of
where
they
been
to
father
barney
knew
very
well
that
his
dear
niece
had
been
on
much
more
intimate
terms
with
her
guest
than
she
pretended
the
rumours
had
reached
his
ears
some
time
since
that
the
younger
of
the
two
strangers
in
south
main
street
was
making
himself
agreeable
to
the
heiress
of
the
hotel
and
he
had
intended
to
come
down
upon
her
with
all
the
might
of
an
uncle
and
if
necessary
with
all
the
authority
of
the
church
but
now
that
fanny
had
discarded
her
lover
he
wisely
felt
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
know
nothing
about
it
both
uncles
and
priests
may
know
too
much
very
foolishly
i
have
seen
them
here
myself
said
he
and
they
have
both
been
up
at
castle
richmond
they
do
say
as
poor
sir
thomas
is
in
a
bad
way
said
shaking
her
head
piteously
and
yet
he
sees
these
men
said
father
barney
i
know
that
for
certain
he
has
seen
them
though
he
will
rarely
see
anybody
young
herbert
is
most
of
the
business
up
about
the
place
said
and
people
do
say
as
how
he
is
going
to
make
a
match
of
it
with
lady
clara
desmond
and
it
the
lucky
girl
she
be
for
he
a
nice
young
fellow
entirely
not
half
equal
to
her
other
joe
owen
that
is
said
fanny
well
i
do
know
that
my
dear
such
a
house
and
property
as
castle
richmond
is
not
likely
to
go
among
the
young
women
and
then
herbert
is
not
so
rampageous
like
as
him
of
hap
house
by
all
accounts
but
father
barney
still
kept
to
his
subject
and
they
are
both
at
your
place
at
the
present
moment
eh
fanny
they
was
to
dine
there
after
i
left
and
the
old
man
said
he
be
down
here
again
next
thursday
continued
the
priest
i
heard
that
for
certain
i
tell
you
what
it
is
they
not
after
any
good
here
they
are
protestants
they
oh
black
protestants
said
but
you
are
not
taking
your
tay
father
bernard
and
she
again
filled
his
cup
for
him
if
you
take
my
advice
fanny
you
give
them
nothing
more
without
seeing
their
money
they
come
to
no
good
here
i
sure
of
that
they
afther
some
mischief
with
that
poor
old
gentleman
at
castle
richmond
and
it
my
belief
the
police
will
have
them
before
they
done
like
enough
said
they
may
have
them
for
what
i
care
said
fanny
who
could
not
help
feeling
that
aby
mollett
had
at
one
time
been
not
altogether
left
without
hope
as
her
suitor
but
you
would
like
anything
like
that
to
happen
in
your
house
said
father
barney
bringing
throuble
and
disgrace
on
an
honest
name
said
there
be
no
disgrace
as
i
knows
of
said
fanny
stoutly
father
makes
his
money
by
the
public
and
in
course
he
takes
in
any
that
comes
the
way
with
money
in
their
pockets
to
pay
the
shot
but
these
molletts
ai
got
the
money
to
pay
the
shot
said
causticly
you
about
sucked
dhry
i
thinking
and
they
owes
you
more
now
than
you
like
to
get
from
i
suppose
father
have
to
take
that
bill
up
said
fanny
assenting
and
so
it
was
settled
down
there
among
them
that
the
molletts
were
to
have
the
cold
shoulder
and
that
they
should
in
fact
be
turned
out
of
the
kanturk
hotel
as
quickly
as
this
could
be
done
better
a
small
loss
at
first
than
a
big
one
at
last
said
with
much
wisdom
they
come
to
mischief
down
here
as
sure
as
my
name
said
the
priest
and
i
be
sorry
your
father
should
be
mixed
up
in
it
and
then
by
degrees
the
conversation
was
changed
but
not
till
the
had
been
taken
away
and
a
square
small
bottle
of
very
particular
whisky
put
on
the
table
in
its
place
and
the
sugar
also
was
brought
and
boiling
water
in
an
immense
jug
as
though
father
barney
were
going
to
make
a
deep
potation
indeed
and
a
lemon
in
a
wine
glass
and
then
the
priest
was
invited
with
much
hospitality
to
make
himself
comfortable
nor
did
the
luxuries
prepared
for
him
end
here
but
fanny
the
pretty
fan
herself
filled
a
pipe
for
him
and
pretended
that
she
would
light
it
for
such
priests
are
merry
enough
sometimes
and
can
joke
as
well
as
other
men
with
their
pretty
nieces
but
you
not
mixing
your
punch
father
bernard
said
with
a
plaintive
melancholy
voice
and
the
wather
getting
cowld
and
all
faix
then
father
bernard
i
mix
it
for
ye
so
i
will
and
so
she
did
and
well
she
knew
how
and
then
she
made
another
for
herself
and
her
niece
urging
that
a
thimbleful
would
do
fanny
all
the
good
in
life
afther
her
ride
acrass
them
cowld
mountains
and
the
priest
looked
on
assenting
blowing
the
comfortable
streams
of
smoke
from
his
nostrils
and
so
father
bernard
you
and
parson
townsend
is
to
meet
again
at
gortnaclough
whereupon
father
bernard
owned
that
such
was
the
case
with
a
nod
not
caring
to
disturb
the
pipe
which
lay
comfortably
on
his
lower
lip
well
well
only
to
think
on
it
continued
that
the
same
room
should
hould
the
two
of
ye
and
she
lifted
up
her
hands
and
shook
her
head
it
houlds
us
both
very
comfortable
i
can
assure
you
mrs
and
he
ai
rampageous
and
he
do
give
hisself
no
airs
well
no
nothing
in
particular
why
should
the
man
be
such
a
fool
as
that
why
in
course
but
they
are
such
fools
father
bernard
they
does
think
theyselves
such
grand
folks
now
do
they
i
give
a
dandy
of
punch
all
round
to
the
company
just
to
hear
you
put
him
down
once
i
would
but
he
is
upsetting
at
all
then
not
the
last
time
we
met
he
was
and
i
do
think
he
intends
it
things
have
come
to
that
now
that
the
parsons
know
where
they
are
and
what
they
have
to
look
to
they
getting
a
lesson
they
not
forget
in
a
hurry
where
are
their
rent
charges
to
come
from
can
you
tell
me
that
mrs
could
not
but
she
remarked
that
pride
would
always
have
a
fall
and
there
no
pride
like
protesthant
pride
said
fanny
it
is
so
upsetting
i
ca
abide
it
all
which
tended
to
show
that
she
had
quite
given
up
her
protestant
lover
and
is
it
getthing
worse
than
iver
with
the
poor
crathurs
said
referring
not
to
the
protestants
but
to
the
victims
of
the
famine
indeed
it
getting
no
betther
said
the
priest
and
i
fearing
it
will
be
worse
before
it
is
over
i
have
married
one
couple
in
drumbarrow
since
november
last
and
that
a
heavy
sign
father
bernard
the
surest
sign
in
the
world
that
they
have
no
money
among
them
at
all
at
all
and
it
is
bad
with
thim
very
bad
very
bad
indeed
glory
be
to
god
the
poor
cratures
said
the
lady
it
is
much
the
like
of
us
have
to
give
away
father
bernard
i
need
be
telling
you
that
but

help

and
so
will
father
uncle
bernard
if

so
bad
off
about
here
i
know
he
give
you
a
thrifle
for
the
asking
in
a
short
time
however
it
came
to
pass
that
those
in
the
cities
could
spare
no
aid
to
the
country
indeed
it
may
be
a
question
whether
the
city
poverty
was
not
the
harder
of
the
two
god
bless
you
both
you
soft
hearts
i
know
and
father
barney
put
his
punch
to
his
lips
whatever
you
can
do
for
me
shall
not
be
thrown
away
and
i
tell
you
what
it
does
behove
us
all
to
put
our
best
foot
out
now
we
will
not
let
them
say
that
the
papists
would
do
nothing
for
their
own
poor
then
an
they
say
anything
of
us
father
bernard
nothing
too
hot
or
too
heavy
for
them
at
any
rate
let
us
not
deserve
it
there
will
be
a
lot
of
them
at
gortnaclough
and
i
shall
tell
them
that
we
on
our
side
wo
be
wanting
to
give
them
their
due
i
must
say
that
they
are
working
well
that
young
herbert
fitzgerald
a
trump
whether
he
protestant
or
catholic
an
they
do
say
he
a
strong
bearing
towards
the
ould
religion
said
god
bless
his
sweet
young
face
av
he
come
back
to
us
that
what
i
say
god
bless
his
face
any
way
say
i
said
father
barney
with
a
wider
philanthropy
he
is
doing
his
best
for
the
people
and
the
time
has
come
now
when
we
must
hang
together
if
it
be
any
way
possible
and
with
this
the
priest
finished
his
pipe
and
wishing
the
ladies
good
night
walked
away
to
his
own
house
chapter
xviii
the
relief
committee
at
this
time
the
famine
was
beginning
to
be
systematised
the
sternest
among
landlords
and
masters
were
driven
to
acknowledge
that
the
people
had
not
got
food
or
the
means
of
earning
it
the
people
themselves
were
learning
that
a
great
national
calamity
had
happened
and
that
the
work
was
god
work
and
the
government
had
fully
recognized
the
necessity
of
taking
the
whole
matter
into
its
own
hands
they
were
responsible
for
the
preservation
of
the
people
and
they
acknowledged
their
responsibility
and
then
two
great
rules
seemed
to
get
themselves
laid
down
not
by
general
consent
for
there
were
many
who
greatly
contested
their
wisdom
but
by
some
force
strong
enough
to
make
itself
dominant
the
first
was
that
the
food
to
be
provided
should
be
earned
and
not
given
away
and
the
second
was
that
the
providing
of
that
food
should
be
left
to
private
competition
and
not
in
any
way
be
undertaken
by
the
government
i
make
bold
to
say
that
both
these
rules
were
wise
and
good
but
how
should
the
people
work
that
government
should
supply
the
wages
was
of
course
an
understood
necessity
and
it
was
also
necessary
that
on
all
such
work
the
amount
of
wages
should
be
regulated
by
the
price
at
which
provisions
might
fix
themselves
these
points
produced
questions
which
were
hotly
debated
by
the
relief
committees
of
the
different
districts
but
at
last
it
got
itself
decided
again
by
the
hands
of
government
that
all
hills
along
the
country
roads
should
be
cut
away
and
that
the
people
should
be
employed
on
this
work
they
were
so
employed
very
little
to
the
advantage
of
the
roads
for
that
or
some
following
years
so
you
have
begun
my
men
said
herbert
to
a
gang
of
labourers
whom
he
found
collected
at
a
certain
point
on
ballydahan
hill
which
lay
on
his
road
from
castle
richmond
to
gortnaclough
in
saying
this
he
had
certainly
paid
them
an
unmerited
compliment
for
they
had
hitherto
begun
nothing
some
thirty
or
forty
men
were
clustered
together
in
the
dirt
and
slop
and
mud
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
armed
with
such
various
tools
as
each
was
able
to
find
with
tools
for
the
most
part
which
would
go
but
a
little
way
in
making
ballydahan
hill
level
or
accessible
this
question
of
tools
also
came
to
a
sort
of
understood
settlement
before
long
and
within
three
months
of
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
legions
of
wheelbarrows
were
to
be
seen
lying
near
every
hill
wheelbarrows
in
hundreds
and
thousands
the
fate
of
those
myriads
of
wheelbarrows
has
always
been
a
mystery
to
me
so
you
have
begun
my
men
said
herbert
addressing
them
in
a
kindly
voice
there
was
a
couple
of
gangsmen
with
them
men
a
little
above
the
others
in
appearance
but
apparently
incapable
of
commencing
the
work
in
hand
for
they
also
were
standing
idle
leaning
against
a
bit
of
wooden
paling
it
had
however
been
decided
that
the
works
at
ballydahan
hill
should
begin
on
this
day
and
there
were
the
men
assembled
one
fact
admitted
of
no
doubt
namely
this
that
the
wages
would
begin
from
this
day
and
then
the
men
came
and
clustered
round
herbert
horse
they
were
creatures
discontented
with
hungry
eyes
each
having
at
his
heart
core
a
deep
sense
of
injustice
done
personally
upon
him
they
hated
this
work
of
cutting
hills
from
the
commencement
to
the
end
hated
it
though
it
was
to
bring
them
wages
and
save
them
and
theirs
from
actual
famine
and
death
they
had
not
been
accustomed
to
the
discomfort
of
being
taken
far
from
their
homes
to
their
daily
work
very
many
of
them
had
never
worked
regularly
for
wages
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
up
to
this
time
such
was
not
the
habit
of
irish
cottiers
they
held
their
own
land
and
laboured
there
for
a
spell
and
then
they
would
work
for
a
spell
as
men
do
in
england
taking
wages
and
then
they
would
be
idle
for
a
spell
it
was
not
exactly
a
profitable
mode
of
life
but
it
had
its
comforts
and
now
these
unfortunates
who
felt
themselves
to
be
driven
forth
like
cattle
in
droves
for
the
first
time
suffered
the
full
wretchedness
of
their
position
they
were
not
rough
and
unruly
or
inclined
to
be
troublesome
and
perhaps
violent
as
men
similarly
circumstanced
so
often
are
in
england
as
irishmen
are
when
collected
in
gangs
out
of
ireland
they
had
no
aptitudes
for
such
roughness
and
no
spirits
for
such
violence
but
they
were
melancholy
given
to
complaint
apathetic
and
utterly
without
interest
in
that
they
were
doing
yz
yer
honer
said
one
man
who
was
standing
shaking
himself
with
his
hands
enveloped
in
the
rags
of
his
pockets
he
had
on
no
coat
and
the
keen
north
wind
seemed
to
be
blowing
through
his
bones
cold
however
as
he
was
he
would
do
nothing
towards
warming
himself
unless
that
occasional
shake
can
be
considered
as
a
doing
of
something
yz
yer
honer
we
begun
thin
since
before
daylight
this
blessed
morning
it
was
now
eleven
and
a
had
not
been
put
into
the
ground
nor
the
work
marked
been
here
before
daylight
said
herbert
and
has
there
been
nobody
to
set
you
to
work
divil
a
sowl
yer
honer
said
another
who
was
sitting
on
a
leaning
with
both
his
hands
on
a
hoe
which
he
held
between
his
legs
barring
thady
molloy
and
shawn
brady
they
two
do
be
over
us
but
they
knows
nothin
o
such
jobs
as
this
thady
molloy
and
shawn
brady
had
with
the
others
moved
up
so
as
to
be
close
to
herbert
horse
but
they
said
not
a
word
towards
vindicating
their
own
fitness
for
command
and
it
mortial
cowld
standing
here
thin
said
another
without
a
bit
to
ate
or
a
sup
to
dhrink
since
last
night
and
then
only
a
lump
of
the
yally
mail
and
the
speaker
moved
about
on
his
toes
and
heels
desirous
of
keeping
his
blood
in
circulation
with
the
smallest
possible
amount
of
trouble
i
telling
the
boys
it
home
we
betther
be
going
said
a
fourth
and
lose
the
tizzy
they
promised
us
said
he
of
the
hoe
sorrow
a
tizzy
they
pay
any
of
yez
for
standing
here
all
day
said
an
little
wretch
of
a
fellow
with
a
black
muzzle
and
a
squinting
eye
ye
may
all
die
in
the
road
first
and
the
man
turned
away
among
the
crowd
as
an
irishman
does
who
has
made
his
speech
and
does
not
want
to
be
answered
you
need
have
no
fear
about
that
my
men
said
herbert
whether
you
be
put
to
work
or
no
you
receive
your
wages
you
may
take
my
word
for
that
i
been
telling
that
for
the
last
said
the
man
with
the
hoe
now
rising
to
his
feet
an
did
somers
be
telling
us
that
we
have
saxpence
each
day
as
long
we
war
here
afore
daylight
said
i
yer
honer
shure
an
was
it
black
night
when
we
war
here
this
blessed
morning
and
devil
a
fear
of
the
tizzy
said
i
but
it
mortial
cowld
an
it
be
asier
for
uz
to
be
doing
a
spell
of
work
than
crouching
about
on
our
hunkers
down
on
the
wet
ground
all
this
was
true
it
had
been
specially
enjoined
upon
them
to
be
early
at
their
work
an
irishman
as
a
rule
will
not
come
regularly
to
his
task
it
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
secure
his
services
every
morning
at
six
but
make
a
special
point
tell
him
that
you
want
him
very
early
and
he
will
come
to
you
in
the
middle
of
the
night
breakfast
every
morning
punctually
at
eight
is
almost
impossible
in
ireland
but
if
you
want
one
special
breakfast
so
that
you
may
start
by
a
train
at
you
are
sure
to
be
served
no
irregular
effort
is
distasteful
to
an
irishman
of
the
lower
classes
not
if
it
entails
on
him
the
loss
of
a
day
food
and
the
loss
of
a
night
rest
the
actual
pleasure
of
the
irregularity
repays
him
for
all
this
and
he
never
tells
you
that
this
or
that
is
not
his
work
he
prefers
work
that
is
not
his
own
your
coachman
will
have
no
objection
to
turn
the
mangle
but
heaven
and
earth
put
together
persuade
him
to
take
the
horses
out
to
exercise
every
morning
at
the
same
hour
these
men
had
been
told
to
come
early
and
they
had
been
there
on
the
since
five
it
was
not
surprising
that
they
were
cold
and
hungry
listless
and
unhappy
and
then
as
young
fitzgerald
was
questioning
the
gangmen
as
to
the
instructions
they
had
received
a
jaunting
car
came
up
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
we
war
to
wait
for
the
ongineer
shawn
brady
had
said
an
shure
an
we
have
waited
an
here
one
of
misther
carroll
cars
from
mallow
said
thady
molloy
and
that
the
ongineer
hisself
thady
molloy
was
right
this
was
the
engineer
himself
who
had
now
arrived
from
mallow
from
this
time
forth
and
for
the
next
twelve
months
the
country
was
full
of
engineers
or
of
men
who
were
so
called
i
do
not
say
this
in
disparagement
but
the
engineers
were
like
the
yellow
meal
when
there
is
an
immense
demand
and
that
a
suddenly
immense
demand
for
any
article
it
is
seldom
easy
to
get
it
very
good
in
those
days
men
became
engineers
with
a
short
amount
of
apprenticeship
but
as
a
rule
they
did
not
do
their
work
badly
in
such
days
as
those
men
if
they
be
men
at
all
will
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
the
engineer
was
driven
up
to
where
they
were
standing
and
he
jumped
off
the
car
among
the
men
who
were
to
work
under
him
with
rather
a
pretentious
air
he
had
not
observed
or
probably
had
not
known
herbert
fitzgerald
he
was
a
very
young
fellow
still
under
beardless
and
fresh
from
england
and
what
hill
is
this
said
he
to
the
driver
ballydahan
shure
yer
honer
that
last
war
and
that
other
the
big
un
intirely
where
the
crass
road
takes
away
to
buttevant
that
was
glounthauneroughtymore
faix
and
that
been
the
murthering
hill
for
cattle
since
first
i
knew
it
bedad
yer
honer
make
it
smooth
as
a
ballydahan
said
the
young
man
taking
a
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
looking
up
the
names
in
his
list
i
got
it
there
should
be
of
them
here
shure
an
here
we
are
these
siven
hours
said
our
friend
of
the
hoe
and
mighty
cowld
we
are
thady
molloy
and
shawn
brady
called
out
the
engineer
managing
thoroughly
to
anglicise
the
pronunciation
of
the
names
though
they
were
not
celtically
composite
to
any
great
degree
yez
we
here
said
thady
coming
forward
and
then
herbert
came
up
and
introduced
himself
and
the
young
engineer
took
off
his
hat
i
came
away
from
mallow
before
eight
said
he
apologetically
but
i
have
four
of
these
places
to
look
after
and
when
one
gets
to
one
of
them
it
is
impossible
to
get
away
again
there
was
one
place
where
i
was
kept
two
hours
before
i
could
get
one
of
the
men
to
understand
what
they
were
to
do
what
is
it
you
call
that
big
hill
glounthauneroughtymore
yer
honer
said
the
driver
to
whom
the
name
was
as
easy
and
familiar
as
his
own
and
you
are
going
to
set
these
men
to
work
now
said
herbert
well
i
do
suppose
they
do
much
fitzgerald
but
i
must
try
and
explain
to
the
head
men
how
they
are
to
begin
they
have
none
of
them
any
tools
you
see
and
then
he
called
out
again
thady
molloy
and
shawn
brady
we
here
said
thady
again
we
did
not
exactly
know
whether
yer
honer
be
afther
beginning
at
the
top
or
the
botthom
that
all
that
war
staying
us
never
fear
said
shawn
but
we
have
ould
ballydahan
level
in
less
than
no
time
we
the
boys
that
can
do
it
fair
and
aisy
it
appeared
to
herbert
that
the
young
engineer
seemed
to
be
rather
bewildered
by
the
job
of
work
before
him
and
therefore
he
rode
on
not
stopping
to
embarrass
him
by
any
inspection
of
his
work
in
process
of
time
no
doubt
so
much
of
the
top
of
ballydahan
hill
was
carried
to
the
bottom
as
made
the
whole
road
altogether
impassable
for
many
months
but
the
great
object
was
gained
the
men
were
fed
and
were
not
fed
by
charity
what
did
it
matter
that
the
springs
of
every
conveyance
in
the
county
cork
were
shattered
by
the
process
and
that
the
works
resulted
in
myriads
of
wheelbarrows
and
then
as
he
rode
on
towards
gortnaclough
herbert
was
overtaken
by
his
friend
the
parson
who
was
also
going
to
the
meeting
of
the
relief
committee
you
have
not
seen
the
men
at
ballydahan
hill
have
you
said
herbert
townsend
explained
that
he
had
not
seen
them
his
road
had
struck
on
to
that
on
which
they
now
were
not
far
from
the
top
of
the
hill
but
i
knew
they
were
to
be
there
this
morning
said
townsend
they
have
sent
quite
a
lad
of
a
fellow
to
show
them
how
to
work
said
herbert
i
fear
we
shall
all
come
to
grief
with
these
for
heaven
sake
do
say
that
at
the
meeting
said
townsend
or
you
be
playing
the
priests
game
out
and
out
father
barney
has
done
all
in
his
power
to
prevent
the
works
but
what
if
father
barney
be
right
said
herbert
but
he
not
right
said
the
parson
energetically
altogether
wrong
i
never
knew
one
of
them
right
in
my
life
yet
in
anything
how
can
they
be
right
but
i
think
you
are
mixing
up
and
church
doctrine
mr
townsend
i
hope
i
may
never
be
in
danger
of
mixing
up
god
and
the
devil
you
can
not
touch
pitch
and
not
be
defiled
remember
that
herbert
fitzgerald
i
will
remember
nothing
of
the
kind
said
herbert
am
i
to
set
myself
up
as
a
judge
and
say
that
this
is
pitch
and
that
is
pitch
do
you
remember
peter
on
the
housetop
was
not
he
afraid
of
what
was
unclean
the
meaning
of
that
was
that
he
was
to
convert
the
gentiles
and
not
give
way
to
their
errors
he
was
to
contend
with
them
and
not
give
way
an
inch
till
he
had
driven
them
from
their
idolatry
townsend
had
been
specially
primed
by
his
wife
that
morning
with
vigorous
hostility
against
father
barney
and
was
grieved
to
his
heart
at
finding
that
his
young
friend
was
prepared
to
take
the
priest
part
in
anything
in
this
matter
of
the
roads
townsend
was
doubtless
right
but
hardly
on
the
score
of
the
arguments
assigned
by
him
i
do
mean
to
say
that
there
should
be
no
said
herbert
after
a
pause
the
general
opinion
seems
to
be
that
we
ca
do
better
i
only
say
that
we
shall
come
to
grief
about
it
those
poor
fellows
there
have
as
much
idea
of
cutting
down
a
hill
as
i
have
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
young
lad
whom
i
left
with
them
has
not
much
more
they
learn
all
in
good
time
let
us
hope
it
will
be
in
good
time
if
we
once
let
them
have
the
idea
that
we
are
to
feed
them
in
idleness
said
townsend
they
will
want
to
go
on
for
ever
in
the
same
way
and
then
when
they
receive
such
immense
sums
in
money
wages
the
priests
will
be
sure
to
get
their
share
if
the
matter
had
been
left
to
me
i
would
have
paid
the
men
in
meal
i
would
never
have
given
them
money
they
should
have
worked
and
got
their
food
the
priest
will
get
a
penny
out
of
every
shilling
you
see
else
and
so
the
matter
was
discussed
between
them
as
they
went
along
to
gortnaclough
when
they
reached
the
room
in
which
the
committee
was
held
they
found
somers
already
in
the
chair
priest
mccarthy
was
there
also
with
his
coadjutor
the
rev
columb
creagh
father
columb
as
he
was
always
called
and
there
was
a
from
boherbuy
one
of
the
middlemen
as
they
were
formerly
named
though
by
the
way
i
never
knew
that
word
to
be
current
in
ireland
it
is
familiar
to
all
and
was
i
suppose
common
some
few
years
since
but
i
never
heard
the
peasants
calling
such
persons
by
that
title
he
was
one
of
those
with
whom
the
present
times
were
likely
to
go
very
hard
he
was
not
a
bad
man
unless
in
so
far
as
this
that
he
had
no
idea
of
owing
any
duty
to
others
beyond
himself
and
his
family
his
doctrine
at
present
amounted
to
this
that
if
you
left
the
people
alone
and
gave
them
no
false
hopes
they
would
contrive
to
live
somehow
he
believed
in
a
good
deal
but
he
had
no
belief
whatever
in
starvation
none
as
yet
it
was
probable
enough
that
some
belief
in
this
might
come
to
him
now
before
long
there
were
also
one
or
two
others
men
who
had
some
stake
in
the
country
but
men
who
had
a
tithe
of
the
interest
possessed
by
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
townsend
again
went
through
the
ceremony
of
shaking
hands
with
his
reverend
brethren
and
on
this
occasion
did
not
seem
to
be
much
the
worse
for
it
indeed
in
looking
at
the
two
men
cursorily
a
stranger
might
have
said
that
the
condescension
was
all
on
the
other
side
was
dressed
quite
smartly
his
black
clothes
were
spruce
and
glossy
his
gloves
of
which
he
still
kept
on
one
and
showed
the
other
were
quite
new
he
was
clean
shaven
and
altogether
he
had
a
shiny
bright
ebon
appearance
about
him
that
quite
did
a
credit
to
his
side
of
the
church
but
our
friend
the
parson
was
discreditably
shabby
his
clothes
were
all
brown
his
white
could
hardly
have
been
clean
during
the
last
hours
and
was
tied
in
a
knot
which
had
worked
itself
nearly
round
to
his
ear
as
he
had
sat
sideways
on
the
car
his
boots
were
ugly
and
badly
brushed
and
his
hat
was
very
little
better
than
some
of
those
worn
by
the
workmen
so
called
at
ballydahan
hill
but
nevertheless
on
looking
accurately
into
the
faces
of
both
one
might
see
which
man
was
the
better
nurtured
and
the
better
born
that
operation
with
the
sow
ear
is
one
may
say
seldom
successful
with
the
first
generation
a
beautiful
morning
this
said
the
coadjutor
addressing
herbert
fitzgerald
with
a
very
mild
voice
and
an
unutterable
look
of
friendship
as
though
he
might
have
said
here
we
are
in
a
boat
together
and
of
course
we
are
all
very
fond
of
each
other
to
tell
the
truth
father
columb
was
not
a
young
man
he
was
slightly
marked
with
the
and
had
a
low
forehead
and
cunning
eyes
yes
it
is
a
nice
morning
said
herbert
we
do
expect
anybody
else
here
do
we
somers
at
any
rate
we
wo
wait
said
somers
so
he
sat
down
in
the
and
they
all
went
to
work
i
am
afraid
somers
said
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
where
he
had
constituted
himself
a
sort
of
deputy
chairman
i
am
afraid
we
are
going
on
a
wrong
tack
the
priest
had
shuffled
away
his
chair
as
he
began
to
speak
and
was
now
standing
with
his
hands
upon
the
table
it
is
singular
how
strong
a
propensity
some
men
have
to
get
upon
their
legs
in
this
way
how
so
mr
said
somers
but
sha
we
be
all
more
comfortable
if
we
keep
our
chairs
there
be
less
ceremony
there
mr
townsend
oh
certainly
said
townsend
less
liable
to
interruption
perhaps
on
our
legs
said
father
columb
smiling
blandly
but
was
far
too
wise
to
fight
the
question
so
he
sat
down
just
as
you
like
said
he
i
can
talk
any
way
sitting
or
standing
walking
or
riding
it
all
one
to
me
but
i
tell
you
how
we
are
on
the
wrong
tack
we
shall
never
get
these
men
to
work
in
gangs
on
the
road
never
they
have
not
been
accustomed
to
be
driven
like
droves
of
sheep
but
droves
of
sheep
do
work
on
the
road
said
townsend
i
know
that
townsend
continued
i
am
quite
well
aware
of
that
but
droves
of
sheep
are
driven
and
these
men
bear
it
an
they
wo
said
father
columb
having
altogether
laid
aside
his
bland
smile
now
that
the
time
had
come
as
he
thought
to
speak
up
for
the
people
they
may
bear
it
in
england
but
they
here
and
the
sternness
of
his
eye
was
almost
invincible
if
they
are
so
foolish
they
must
be
taught
better
manners
said
townsend
but
you
find
they
work
just
as
other
men
do
look
at
the
navvies
and
look
at
the
navvies
wages
said
father
columb
besides
the
navvies
only
go
if
they
like
it
said
the
parish
priest
and
these
men
need
not
go
unless
they
like
it
said
somers
only
with
this
proviso
that
if
they
can
not
manage
for
themselves
they
must
fall
into
our
way
of
managing
for
them
what
i
say
is
this
said
let
manage
for
god
bless
my
sowl
why
we
shall
be
skinned
alive
if
we
have
to
pay
all
this
money
back
to
government
if
government
chooses
to
squander
thousands
in
this
way
government
should
bear
the
brunt
that
what
i
say
eventually
government
that
is
the
whole
nation
did
bear
the
brunt
but
it
would
not
have
been
very
wise
to
promise
this
at
the
time
but
we
need
hardly
debate
all
that
at
the
present
moment
said
somers
that
matter
of
the
roads
has
already
been
decided
for
us
and
we
ca
alter
it
if
we
would
then
we
may
as
well
shut
up
shop
said
it
all
very
aisy
to
talk
in
that
way
said
father
columb
but
the
government
as
you
call
it
ca
make
men
work
it
ca
force
eight
millions
of
the
finest
pisantry
on
god
earth
and
father
columb
was
by
degrees
pushing
away
the
seat
from
under
him
when
he
was
cruelly
and
ruthlessly
stopped
by
his
own
parish
priest
i
beg
your
pardon
for
a
moment
creagh
said
he
but
perhaps
we
are
getting
a
little
out
of
the
track
what
somers
says
is
very
true
if
these
men
wo
work
on
the
road
and
i
do
think
they
will
the
responsibility
is
not
on
us
that
matter
has
been
decided
for
us
men
will
sooner
work
anywhere
than
starve
said
townsend
some
men
will
said
father
columb
with
a
great
deal
of
meaning
in
his
tone
what
he
intended
to
convey
was
this
that
protestants
no
doubt
would
do
so
under
the
dominion
of
the
flesh
but
that
roman
catholics
being
under
the
dominion
of
the
spirit
would
perish
first
at
any
rate
we
must
try
said
father
exactly
said
somers
and
what
we
have
now
to
do
is
to
see
how
we
may
best
enable
these
workers
to
live
on
their
wages
and
how
those
others
are
to
live
who
when
all
is
done
will
get
no
wages
i
think
we
had
better
turn
shopkeepers
ourselves
and
open
stores
for
them
everywhere
said
herbert
that
is
what
we
are
doing
already
at
berryhill
and
import
our
own
corn
said
the
parson
and
where
are
we
to
get
the
money
said
the
priest
and
why
are
we
to
ruin
the
merchants
said
whose
brother
was
in
the
in
cork
and
shut
up
all
the
small
shopkeepers
said
father
columb
whose
mother
was
established
in
that
line
in
the
neighbourhood
of
castleisland
we
could
not
do
it
said
somers
the
demand
upon
us
would
be
so
great
that
we
should
certainly
break
down
and
then
where
would
we
be
but
for
a
time
somers
pleaded
herbert
for
a
time
we
may
do
something
in
that
way
till
other
means
present
themselves
but
we
must
refuse
all
relief
they
who
can
not
or
do
not
bring
money
must
go
into
the
workhouses
you
will
not
get
houses
in
county
cork
sufficient
to
hold
them
said
father
bernard
and
so
the
debate
went
on
not
altogether
without
some
sparks
of
wisdom
with
many
sparks
also
of
eager
benevolence
and
some
few
passing
clouds
of
fuliginous
and
then
lists
were
produced
with
the
names
on
them
of
all
who
were
supposed
to
be
in
want
which
were
about
to
become
before
long
lists
of
the
whole
population
of
the
country
and
at
last
it
was
decided
among
them
that
in
their
district
nothing
should
be
absolutely
given
away
except
to
old
women
and
widows
which
kindhearted
clause
was
speedily
neutralised
by
women
becoming
widows
while
their
husbands
were
still
living
and
it
was
decided
also
that
as
long
as
their
money
lasted
the
at
berryhill
should
be
kept
open
and
mill
kept
going
and
the
little
shop
maintained
so
that
to
some
extent
a
check
might
be
maintained
on
the
prices
of
the
hucksters
and
in
this
way
they
got
through
their
work
not
perhaps
with
the
sagacity
of
solomon
but
as
i
have
said
with
an
average
amount
of
wisdom
as
will
always
be
the
case
when
men
set
about
their
tasks
with
true
hearts
and
honest
minds
and
then
when
they
parted
the
two
clergymen
of
the
parish
shook
hands
with
each
other
again
having
perhaps
less
animosity
against
each
other
than
they
had
ever
felt
before
there
had
been
a
joke
or
two
over
the
table
at
which
both
had
laughed
the
priest
had
wisely
shown
some
deference
to
the
parson
and
the
parson
had
immediately
returned
it
by
referring
some
question
to
the
priest
how
often
does
it
not
happen
that
when
we
come
across
those
whom
we
have
hated
and
avoided
all
our
lives
we
find
that
they
are
not
quite
so
bad
as
we
had
thought
that
old
gentleman
of
whom
we
wot
is
never
so
black
as
he
has
been
painted
the
work
of
the
committee
took
them
nearly
the
whole
day
so
that
they
did
not
separate
till
it
was
nearly
dark
when
they
did
so
somers
and
herbert
fitzgerald
rode
home
together
i
always
live
in
mortal
fear
said
herbert
that
townsend
and
the
priests
will
break
out
into
warfare
as
they
have
done
it
yet
they
wo
do
it
now
said
somers
is
not
without
sense
and
townsend
queer
and
intolerant
as
he
is
has
good
feeling
if
he
and
father
columb
were
left
together
i
do
know
what
might
happen
prendergast
is
to
be
with
you
the
day
after
is
he
not
so
i
understood
my
father
to
say
will
you
let
me
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
herbert
certainly
then
do
be
in
the
house
much
on
the
day
after
he
comes
arrive
probably
to
dinner
i
suppose
he
will
if
so
leave
castle
richmond
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
and
do
not
return
till
near
it
may
be
that
your
father
will
not
wish
you
to
be
near
him
whatever
this
matter
may
be
you
may
be
sure
that
you
will
know
it
before
prendergast
leaves
the
country
i
am
very
glad
that
he
is
coming
herbert
promised
that
he
would
take
this
advice
and
he
thought
himself
that
among
other
things
he
might
go
over
to
inspect
that
clady
boiler
and
of
course
call
at
desmond
court
on
his
way
and
then
when
they
got
near
to
castle
richmond
they
parted
company
somers
stopping
at
his
own
place
and
herbert
riding
home
alone
chapter
xix
the
friend
of
the
family
on
the
day
named
by
herbert
and
only
an
hour
before
dinner
prendergast
did
arrive
at
castle
richmond
the
great
southern
and
western
railway
was
not
then
open
as
far
as
mallow
and
the
journey
from
dublin
was
long
and
tedious
i
see
him
of
course
said
sir
thomas
to
lady
fitzgerald
but
i
put
off
this
business
till
this
he
said
in
a
tone
of
distress
and
agony
which
showed
too
plainly
how
he
dreaded
the
work
which
he
had
before
him
but
you
come
in
to
dinner
lady
fitzgerald
had
said
no
he
answered
not
love
i
have
to
think
about
this
and
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
head
as
though
this
thinking
about
it
had
already
been
too
much
for
him
prendergast
was
a
man
over
sixty
years
of
age
being
in
fact
considerably
senior
to
sir
thomas
himself
but
no
one
would
have
dreamed
of
calling
prendergast
an
old
man
he
was
short
of
stature
well
made
and
in
good
proportion
he
was
wiry
strong
and
almost
robust
he
walked
as
though
in
putting
his
foot
to
the
earth
he
always
wished
to
proclaim
that
he
was
afraid
of
no
man
and
no
thing
his
hair
was
grizzled
and
his
whiskers
were
grey
and
round
about
his
mouth
his
face
was
wrinkled
but
with
him
even
these
things
hardly
seemed
to
be
signs
of
old
age
he
was
said
by
many
who
knew
him
to
be
a
stern
man
and
there
was
that
in
his
face
which
seemed
to
warrant
such
a
character
but
he
had
also
the
reputation
of
being
a
very
just
man
and
those
who
knew
him
best
could
tell
tales
of
him
which
proved
that
his
sternness
was
at
any
rate
compatible
with
a
wide
benevolence
he
was
a
man
who
himself
had
known
but
little
mental
suffering
and
who
owned
no
mental
weakness
and
it
might
be
therefore
that
he
was
impatient
of
such
weakness
in
others
to
chance
acquaintances
his
manners
were
not
soft
or
perhaps
palatable
but
to
his
old
friends
his
very
brusqueness
was
pleasing
he
was
a
bachelor
well
off
in
the
world
and
to
a
certain
extent
fond
of
society
he
was
a
solicitor
by
profession
having
his
office
somewhere
in
the
purlieus
of
lincoln
inn
and
living
in
an
house
not
far
distant
from
that
classic
spot
i
have
said
that
he
owned
no
mental
weakness
when
i
say
further
that
he
was
slightly
afflicted
with
personal
vanity
and
thought
a
good
deal
about
the
set
of
his
hair
the
shape
of
his
coat
the
fit
of
his
boots
the
whiteness
of
his
hands
and
the
external
trim
of
his
umbrella
perhaps
i
may
be
considered
to
have
contradicted
myself
but
such
was
the
case
he
was
a
handsome
man
too
with
clear
bright
gray
eyes
a
nose
and
expressive
mouth
of
which
the
lips
however
were
somewhat
too
thin
no
man
with
thin
lips
ever
seems
to
me
to
be
genially
human
at
all
points
such
was
prendergast
and
my
readers
will
i
trust
feel
for
sir
thomas
and
pity
him
in
that
he
was
about
to
place
his
wounds
in
the
hands
of
so
ruthless
a
surgeon
but
a
surgeon
to
be
of
use
should
be
ruthless
in
one
sense
he
should
have
the
power
of
cutting
and
cauterizing
of
phlebotomy
and
without
effect
on
his
own
nerves
this
power
prendergast
possessed
and
therefore
it
may
be
said
that
sir
thomas
had
chosen
his
surgeon
judiciously
none
of
the
castle
richmond
family
except
sir
thomas
himself
had
ever
seen
this
gentleman
nor
had
sir
thomas
often
come
across
him
of
late
years
but
he
was
what
we
in
england
call
an
old
family
friend
and
i
doubt
whether
we
in
england
have
any
more
valuable
english
characteristic
than
that
of
having
old
family
friends
old
family
feuds
are
not
common
with
us
not
so
common
as
with
some
other
people
sons
who
now
hated
their
father
enemies
would
have
but
a
bad
chance
before
a
commission
of
lunacy
but
an
old
family
friend
is
supposed
to
stick
to
one
from
generation
to
generation
on
his
arrival
at
castle
richmond
he
was
taken
in
to
sir
thomas
before
dinner
you
find
me
but
in
a
poor
state
said
sir
thomas
shaking
in
his
fear
of
what
was
before
him
as
the
poor
wretch
does
before
an
dentist
who
is
about
to
operate
you
will
be
better
soon
prendergast
had
said
as
a
man
always
does
say
under
such
circumstances
what
other
remark
was
possible
to
him
sir
thomas
thinks
that
he
had
better
not
trouble
you
with
business
said
lady
fitzgerald
to
this
also
prendergast
agreed
willingly
we
shall
both
of
us
be
fresher
after
breakfast
he
remarked
as
if
any
time
made
any
difference
to
him
as
though
he
were
not
always
fresh
and
ready
for
any
work
that
might
turn
up
that
evening
was
not
passed
very
pleasantly
by
the
family
at
castle
richmond
to
all
of
them
prendergast
was
absolutely
a
stranger
and
was
hardly
the
man
to
ingratiate
himself
with
strangers
at
the
first
interview
and
then
too
they
were
all
somewhat
afraid
of
him
he
had
come
down
thither
on
some
business
which
was
to
them
altogether
mysterious
and
as
far
as
they
knew
he
and
he
alone
was
to
be
intrusted
with
the
mystery
he
of
course
said
nothing
to
them
on
the
subject
but
he
looked
in
their
eyes
as
though
he
were
conscious
of
being
replete
with
secret
importance
and
on
this
very
account
they
were
afraid
of
him
and
then
poor
lady
fitzgerald
though
she
bore
up
against
the
weight
of
her
misery
better
than
did
her
husband
was
herself
very
wretched
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
that
all
this
would
end
in
nothing
that
prendergast
would
put
everything
right
and
that
after
his
departure
they
would
go
on
as
happily
as
ever
this
was
the
doctrine
of
the
younger
part
of
the
family
who
would
not
think
that
anything
was
radically
wrong
but
lady
fitzgerald
had
always
at
her
heart
the
memory
of
her
early
marriage
troubles
and
she
feared
greatly
though
she
feared
she
knew
not
what
herbert
fitzgerald
and
aunt
letty
did
endeavour
to
keep
up
some
conversation
with
prendergast
and
the
irish
famine
was
of
course
the
subject
but
this
did
not
go
on
pleasantly
prendergast
was
desirous
of
information
but
the
statements
which
were
made
to
him
one
moment
by
young
fitzgerald
were
contradicted
in
the
next
by
his
aunt
he
would
declare
that
the
better
educated
of
the
roman
catholics
were
prepared
to
do
their
duty
by
their
country
whereas
aunt
letty
would
consider
herself
bound
both
by
party
feeling
and
religious
duty
to
prove
that
the
roman
catholics
were
bad
in
everything
oh
herbert
to
hear
you
say
so
she
exclaimed
at
one
time
it
makes
me
tremble
in
my
shoes
it
is
dreadful
to
think
that
those
people
should
have
got
such
a
hold
over
you
i
really
think
that
the
roman
catholic
priests
are
liberal
in
their
ideas
and
moral
in
their
conduct
this
was
the
speech
which
had
made
aunt
letty
tremble
in
her
shoes
and
it
may
therefore
be
conceived
that
prendergast
did
not
find
himself
able
to
form
any
firm
opinion
from
the
statements
then
made
to
him
instead
of
doing
so
he
set
them
both
down
as
wild
irish
whom
it
would
be
insane
to
trust
and
of
whom
it
was
absurd
to
make
inquiries
it
may
however
be
possibly
the
case
that
prendergast
himself
had
his
own
prejudices
as
well
as
aunt
letty
and
herbert
fitzgerald
on
the
following
morning
they
were
still
more
mute
at
breakfast
the
time
was
coming
in
which
prendergast
was
to
go
to
work
and
even
he
gifted
though
he
was
with
iron
nerves
began
to
feel
somewhat
unpleasantly
the
nature
of
the
task
which
he
had
undertaken
lady
fitzgerald
did
not
appear
at
all
indeed
during
the
whole
of
and
up
to
the
moment
at
which
prendergast
was
summoned
she
was
sitting
with
her
husband
holding
his
hand
in
hers
and
looking
tenderly
but
painfully
into
his
face
she
so
sat
with
him
for
above
an
hour
but
he
spoke
to
her
no
word
of
this
revelation
he
was
about
to
make
herbert
and
the
girls
and
even
aunt
letty
sat
solemn
and
silent
as
though
it
was
known
by
them
all
that
something
dreadful
was
to
be
said
and
done
at
last
herbert
who
had
left
the
room
returned
to
it
my
father
will
see
you
now
prendergast
if
you
will
step
up
to
him
said
he
and
then
he
ran
to
his
mother
and
told
her
that
he
should
leave
the
house
till
but
if
he
sends
for
you
herbert
should
you
not
be
in
the
way
it
is
more
likely
that
he
should
send
for
you
and
were
i
to
remain
here
i
should
be
going
into
his
room
when
he
did
not
want
me
and
then
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
off
prendergast
with
serious
air
and
slow
steps
and
solemn
resolve
to
do
what
he
had
to
do
at
any
rate
with
justice
walked
away
from
the
to
the
baronet
study
the
task
of
an
old
friend
is
not
always
a
pleasant
one
and
prendergast
felt
that
it
was
not
so
at
the
present
moment
be
gentle
with
him
said
aunt
letty
catching
hold
of
his
arm
as
he
went
through
the
passage
he
merely
moved
his
head
twice
in
token
of
assent
and
then
passed
on
into
the
room
the
reader
will
have
learnt
by
this
time
with
tolerable
accuracy
what
was
the
nature
of
the
revelation
which
sir
thomas
was
called
upon
to
make
and
he
will
be
tolerably
certain
as
to
the
advice
which
prendergast
as
an
honest
man
would
give
in
that
respect
there
was
no
difficulty
the
laws
of
meum
and
tuum
are
sufficiently
clear
if
a
man
will
open
his
eyes
to
look
at
them
in
this
case
they
were
altogether
clear
these
broad
acres
of
castle
richmond
did
belong
to
sir
thomas
for
his
life
but
after
his
death
they
could
not
belong
to
his
son
herbert
it
was
a
matter
which
admitted
of
no
doubt
no
question
as
to
whether
the
molletts
would
or
would
not
hold
their
tongue
could
bear
upon
it
in
the
least
justice
in
this
case
must
be
done
even
though
the
heavens
should
fall
it
was
sad
and
piteous
stern
and
hard
as
was
the
man
who
pronounced
this
doom
nevertheless
the
salt
tear
collected
in
his
eyes
and
blinded
him
as
he
looked
upon
the
anguish
which
his
judgment
had
occasioned
yes
herbert
must
be
told
that
he
in
the
world
was
nobody
that
he
must
earn
his
bread
and
set
about
doing
so
right
soon
who
could
say
that
his
father
life
was
worth
a
twelvemonth
purchase
he
must
be
told
that
he
was
nobody
in
the
world
and
instructed
also
to
tell
her
whom
he
loved
an
earl
daughter
the
same
tidings
that
he
was
nobody
that
he
would
come
to
possess
no
property
and
that
in
the
law
eyes
did
not
possess
even
a
name
how
would
his
young
heart
suffice
for
the
endurance
of
so
terrible
a
calamity
and
those
pretty
girls
so
softly
brought
up
so
tenderly
nurtured
it
must
be
explained
to
them
too
that
they
must
no
longer
be
proud
of
their
father
lineage
and
their
mother
fame
and
that
other
fitzgerald
must
be
summoned
and
told
of
all
this
he
on
whom
they
had
looked
down
whom
the
young
heir
had
robbed
of
his
love
whom
they
had
cast
out
from
among
them
as
unworthy
notice
must
be
sent
to
him
that
he
was
the
heir
to
castle
richmond
that
he
would
reign
as
the
future
baronet
in
those
gracious
chambers
it
was
he
who
could
now
make
a
great
county
lady
of
the
daughter
of
the
countess
it
will
be
very
soon
very
soon
sobbed
forth
the
poor
victim
and
indeed
to
look
at
him
one
might
say
that
it
would
be
soon
there
were
moments
when
prendergast
hardly
thought
that
he
would
live
through
that
frightful
day
but
all
of
which
we
have
yet
spoken
hardly
operated
upon
the
baronet
mind
in
creating
that
stupor
of
sorrow
which
now
weighed
him
to
the
earth
it
was
none
of
these
things
that
utterly
broke
him
down
and
crushed
him
like
a
mangled
reed
he
had
hardly
mind
left
to
remember
his
children
it
was
for
the
wife
of
his
bosom
that
he
sorrowed
the
wife
of
his
bosom
he
persisted
in
so
calling
her
through
the
whole
interview
and
even
in
his
weakness
obliged
the
strong
man
before
him
so
to
name
her
also
she
was
his
wife
before
god
and
should
be
his
to
the
end
ah
for
how
short
a
time
was
that
is
she
to
leave
me
he
once
said
turning
to
his
friend
with
his
hands
clasped
together
praying
that
some
mercy
might
be
shown
to
his
wretchedness
is
she
to
leave
me
he
repeated
and
then
sank
on
his
knees
upon
the
floor
and
how
was
prendergast
to
answer
this
question
how
was
he
to
decide
whether
or
no
this
man
and
woman
might
still
live
together
as
husband
and
wife
oh
my
reader
think
of
it
if
you
can
and
put
yourself
for
a
moment
in
the
place
of
that
old
family
friend
tell
me
tell
me
is
she
to
leave
me
repeated
the
poor
victim
of
all
this
misery
the
sternness
and
justice
of
the
man
at
last
gave
way
no
said
he
that
can
not
i
should
think
be
necessary
they
can
not
demand
that
but
you
wo
desert
me
said
sir
thomas
when
this
crumb
of
comfort
was
handed
to
him
and
he
remembered
as
he
spoke
the
bloodshot
eyes
of
the
miscreant
who
had
dared
to
tell
him
that
the
wife
of
his
bosom
might
be
legally
torn
from
him
by
the
hands
of
another
man
you
wo
desert
me
said
sir
thomas
meaning
by
that
to
bind
his
friend
to
an
obligation
that
at
any
rate
his
wife
should
not
be
taken
from
him
no
said
prendergast
i
will
not
desert
you
certainly
not
that
certainly
not
that
just
then
it
was
in
his
heart
to
promise
almost
anything
that
he
was
asked
who
could
have
refused
such
solace
as
this
to
a
man
so
terribly
overburthened
but
there
was
another
point
of
view
at
which
prendergast
had
looked
from
the
commencement
but
at
which
he
could
not
get
sir
thomas
to
look
at
all
it
certainly
was
necessary
that
the
whole
truth
in
this
matter
should
be
made
known
and
declared
openly
this
fair
inheritance
must
go
to
the
right
owner
and
not
to
the
wrong
though
the
affliction
on
sir
thomas
was
very
heavy
and
would
be
equally
so
on
all
the
family
he
would
not
on
that
account
for
the
sake
of
saving
him
and
them
from
that
affliction
be
justified
in
robbing
another
person
of
what
was
legally
and
actually
that
other
person
property
it
was
a
matter
of
astonishment
to
prendergast
that
a
conscientious
man
as
sir
thomas
certainly
was
should
have
been
able
to
look
at
the
matter
in
any
other
light
that
he
should
ever
have
brought
himself
to
have
dealings
in
the
matter
with
mollett
justice
in
the
case
was
clear
and
the
truth
must
be
declared
but
then
they
must
take
good
care
to
find
out
absolutely
what
the
truth
was
having
heard
all
that
sir
thomas
had
to
say
and
having
sifted
all
that
he
did
hear
prendergast
thoroughly
believed
in
his
heart
of
hearts
that
that
wretched
miscreant
was
the
actual
and
true
husband
of
the
poor
lady
whom
he
would
have
to
see
but
it
was
necessary
that
this
should
be
proved
castle
richmond
for
the
family
and
all
earthly
peace
of
mind
for
that
unfortunate
lady
and
gentleman
were
not
to
be
given
up
on
the
bare
word
of
a
scheming
scoundrel
for
whom
no
crime
would
be
too
black
and
no
cruelty
too
monstrous
the
proofs
must
be
looked
into
before
anything
was
done
and
they
must
be
looked
into
before
anything
was
said
to
lady
fitzgerald
we
surely
may
give
her
that
name
as
yet
but
then
how
were
they
to
get
at
the
proofs
at
the
proofs
one
way
or
the
other
that
mollett
himself
had
his
marriage
certificate
sir
thomas
declared
that
evidence
had
been
brought
home
to
his
own
mind
of
the
identity
of
the
man
though
what
was
the
nature
of
that
evidence
he
could
not
now
describe
as
to
that
he
was
quite
explicit
indeed
as
i
have
said
above
he
almost
refused
to
consider
the
question
as
admitting
of
a
doubt
that
mollett
was
the
man
to
whom
his
wife
had
been
married
he
thoroughly
believed
and
to
tell
the
truth
prendergast
was
afraid
to
urge
him
to
look
for
much
comfort
in
this
direction
the
whole
manner
of
the
man
mollett
had
been
such
as
to
show
that
he
himself
was
sure
of
his
ground
prendergast
could
hardly
doubt
that
he
was
the
man
although
he
felt
himself
bound
to
remark
that
nothing
should
be
said
to
lady
fitzgerald
till
inquiry
had
been
made
mollett
himself
would
be
at
castle
richmond
on
the
next
day
but
one
in
accordance
with
the
appointment
made
by
himself
and
if
necessary
he
could
be
kept
in
custody
till
he
had
been
identified
as
being
the
man
or
as
not
being
the
man
who
had
married
miss
wainwright
there
is
nobody
living
with
you
now
who
knew
lady
fitzgerald
at
asked
prendergast
yes
said
sir
thomas
there
is
one
maid
servant
and
then
he
explained
how
jones
had
lived
with
his
wife
before
her
first
marriage
during
those
few
months
in
which
she
had
been
called
talbot
and
from
that
day
even
up
to
the
present
hour
then
she
must
have
known
this
man
said
prendergast
but
sir
thomas
was
not
in
a
frame
of
mind
at
all
suited
to
the
sifting
of
evidence
he
did
not
care
to
say
anything
about
jones
he
got
no
crumb
of
comfort
out
of
that
view
of
the
matter
things
had
come
out
unwittingly
for
the
most
part
in
his
conversations
with
mollett
which
made
him
quite
certain
as
to
the
truth
of
the
main
part
of
the
story
all
those
dorsetshire
localities
were
well
known
to
the
man
the
bearings
of
the
house
the
circumstances
of
wainwright
parsonage
the
whole
history
of
those
months
so
that
on
this
subject
sir
thomas
had
no
doubt
and
we
may
as
well
know
at
once
that
there
was
no
room
for
doubt
our
friend
of
the
kanturk
hotel
south
main
street
cork
was
the
man
who
thirty
years
before
had
married
the
of
the
dorsetshire
parson
prendergast
however
stood
awhile
before
the
fire
balancing
the
evidence
the
woman
must
have
known
him
he
said
to
himself
and
surely
she
could
tell
us
whether
he
be
like
the
man
and
lady
fitzgerald
herself
would
know
but
then
who
would
have
the
hardness
of
heart
to
ask
lady
fitzgerald
to
confront
that
man
he
remained
with
sir
thomas
that
day
for
hours
the
long
winter
evening
had
begun
to
make
itself
felt
by
its
increasing
gloom
before
he
left
him
wine
and
biscuits
were
sent
in
to
them
but
neither
of
them
even
noticed
the
man
who
brought
them
twice
in
the
day
however
prendergast
gave
the
baronet
a
glass
of
sherry
which
the
latter
swallowed
unconsciously
and
then
at
about
four
the
lawyer
prepared
to
take
his
leave
i
will
see
you
early
said
he
immediately
after
breakfast
you
are
going
then
said
sir
thomas
who
greatly
dreaded
being
left
alone
not
away
you
know
said
prendergast
i
am
not
going
to
leave
the
house
no
said
sir
thomas
no
of
course
not
but
and
then
he
paused
eh
said
prendergast
you
were
saying
something
they
will
be
coming
in
to
me
now
said
sir
thomas
wailing
like
a
child
now
when
you
are
gone
and
what
am
i
to
say
to
them
i
would
say
nothing
at
present
nothing
and
my
wife
he
asked
again
through
this
interview
he
studiously
called
her
his
wife
is
is
she
to
know
it
when
we
are
assured
that
this
man
story
is
true
sir
thomas
she
must
know
it
that
will
probably
be
very
soon
in
a
day
or
two
till
then
i
think
you
had
better
tell
her
nothing
and
what
shall
i
say
to
her
say
nothing
i
think
it
probable
that
she
will
not
ask
any
questions
if
she
does
tell
her
that
the
business
between
you
and
me
is
not
yet
over
i
will
tell
your
son
that
at
present
he
had
better
not
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
of
my
visit
here
and
then
he
again
took
the
hand
of
the
unfortunate
gentleman
and
having
pressed
it
with
more
tenderness
than
seemed
to
belong
to
him
he
left
the
room
he
left
the
room
and
hurried
into
the
hall
and
out
of
the
house
but
as
he
did
so
he
could
see
that
he
was
watched
by
lady
fitzgerald
she
was
on
the
alert
to
go
to
her
husband
as
soon
as
she
should
know
that
he
was
alone
of
what
then
took
place
between
those
two
we
need
say
nothing
but
will
wander
forth
for
a
while
with
prendergast
into
the
park
prendergast
had
been
used
to
hard
work
all
his
life
but
he
had
never
undergone
a
day
of
severer
toil
than
that
through
which
he
had
just
past
nor
was
it
yet
over
he
had
laid
it
down
in
a
broad
way
as
his
opinion
that
the
whole
truth
in
this
matter
should
be
declared
to
the
world
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
might
and
to
this
opinion
sir
thomas
had
acceded
without
a
word
of
expostulation
but
in
this
was
by
no
means
included
all
that
portion
of
the
burden
which
now
fell
upon
prendergast
shoulders
it
would
be
for
him
to
look
into
the
evidence
and
then
it
would
be
for
him
also
heavy
and
worst
task
of
all
to
break
the
matter
to
lady
fitzgerald
as
he
sauntered
out
into
the
park
to
wander
about
for
half
an
hour
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
his
head
was
throbbing
with
pain
the
family
friend
in
this
instance
had
certainly
been
severely
taxed
in
the
exercise
of
his
friendship
and
what
was
he
to
do
next
how
was
he
to
conduct
himself
that
evening
in
the
family
circle
knowing
as
he
so
well
did
that
his
coming
there
was
to
bring
destruction
upon
them
all
be
tender
to
him
aunt
letty
had
said
little
knowing
how
great
a
call
there
would
be
on
his
tenderness
of
heart
and
how
little
scope
for
any
tenderness
of
purpose
and
was
it
absolutely
necessary
that
that
blow
should
fall
in
all
its
severity
he
asked
himself
this
question
over
and
over
again
and
always
had
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
necessary
there
could
be
no
possible
mitigation
the
son
must
be
told
that
he
was
no
son
no
son
in
the
eye
of
the
law
the
wife
must
be
told
that
she
was
no
wife
and
the
distant
relative
must
be
made
acquainted
with
his
golden
prospects
the
position
of
herbert
and
clara
and
of
their
promised
marriage
had
been
explained
to
him
and
all
that
too
must
be
shivered
into
fragments
how
was
it
possible
that
the
penniless
daughter
of
an
earl
should
give
herself
in
marriage
to
a
youth
who
was
not
only
penniless
also
but
illegitimate
and
without
a
profession
look
at
it
in
which
way
he
would
it
was
all
misery
and
ruin
and
it
had
fallen
upon
him
to
pronounce
the
doom
he
could
not
himself
believe
that
there
was
any
doubt
as
to
the
general
truth
of
mollett
statement
he
would
of
course
inquire
he
would
hear
what
the
man
had
to
say
and
see
what
he
had
to
adduce
he
would
also
examine
that
old
servant
and
if
necessary
and
if
possible
also
he
would
induce
lady
fitzgerald
to
see
the
man
but
he
did
feel
convinced
that
on
this
point
there
was
no
doubt
and
then
he
lifted
up
his
hands
in
astonishment
at
the
folly
which
had
been
committed
by
a
marriage
under
such
circumstances
as
wise
men
will
do
in
the
decline
of
years
when
young
people
in
the
heyday
of
youth
have
not
been
wise
if
they
had
waited
for
a
term
of
years
he
said
and
if
he
then
had
not
presented
himself
a
term
of
years
such
as
jacob
served
for
rachel
seems
so
light
an
affair
to
old
bachelors
looking
back
at
the
loves
of
their
young
friends
and
so
he
walked
about
in
the
dusk
by
no
means
a
happy
man
nor
in
any
way
satisfied
with
the
work
which
was
still
before
him
how
was
he
to
face
lady
fitzgerald
or
tell
her
of
her
fate
in
what
words
must
he
describe
to
herbert
fitzgerald
the
position
which
in
future
he
must
fill
the
past
had
been
dreadful
to
him
and
the
future
would
be
no
less
so
in
spite
of
his
character
as
a
hard
stern
man
when
he
returned
to
the
house
he
met
young
fitzgerald
in
the
hall
have
you
been
to
your
father
he
asked
immediately
herbert
in
a
low
voice
and
with
a
saddened
face
said
that
he
had
just
come
from
his
father
room
but
prendergast
at
once
knew
that
nothing
of
the
truth
had
been
told
to
him
you
found
him
very
weak
said
prendergast
oh
very
weak
said
herbert
more
than
weak
utterly
prostrate
he
was
lying
on
the
sofa
almost
unable
to
speak
my
mother
was
with
him
and
is
still
there
and
she
he
was
painfully
anxious
to
know
whether
sir
thomas
had
been
weak
enough
or
strong
enough
to
tell
his
wife
any
of
the
story
which
that
morning
had
been
told
to
him
she
is
doing
what
she
can
to
comfort
him
said
herbert
but
it
is
very
hard
for
her
to
be
left
so
utterly
in
the
dark
prendergast
was
passing
on
to
his
room
but
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
herbert
stopped
him
again
going
up
the
stairs
with
him
and
almost
whispering
into
his
ear
i
trust
prendergast
said
he
that
things
are
not
to
go
on
in
this
way
no
no
said
prendergast
because
it
is
unbearable
unbearable
for
my
mother
and
for
me
and
for
us
all
my
mother
thinks
that
some
terrible
thing
has
happened
to
the
property
but
if
so
why
should
i
not
be
told
of
anything
that
really
has
happened
or
does
happen
you
will
be
told
i
do
know
whether
you
are
aware
of
it
prendergast
but
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
and
i
have
been
given
to
understand
that
is
i
thought
that
this
might
take
place
very
soon
my
mother
seems
to
think
that
your
coming
here
may
may
defer
it
if
so
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
expect
that
something
shall
be
told
to
me
certainly
you
have
a
right
my
dear
young
friend
but
fitzgerald
for
your
own
sake
for
all
our
sakes
wait
patiently
for
a
few
hours
i
have
waited
patiently
yes
i
know
it
you
have
behaved
admirably
but
i
can
not
speak
to
you
now
this
time
the
day
after
i
will
tell
you
everything
that
i
know
but
do
not
speak
of
this
to
your
mother
i
make
this
promise
only
to
you
and
then
he
passed
on
into
his
with
this
herbert
was
obliged
to
be
content
that
evening
he
again
saw
his
father
and
mother
but
he
told
them
nothing
of
what
had
passed
between
him
and
prendergast
lady
fitzgerald
remained
in
the
study
with
sir
thomas
the
whole
evening
nay
almost
the
whole
night
and
the
slow
hours
as
they
passed
there
were
very
dreadful
no
one
came
to
table
but
aunt
letty
prendergast
and
herbert
and
between
them
hardly
a
word
was
spoken
the
poor
girls
had
found
themselves
utterly
unable
to
appear
they
were
dissolved
in
tears
and
crouching
over
the
fire
in
their
own
room
and
the
moment
that
aunt
letty
left
the
table
prendergast
arose
also
he
was
suffering
he
said
cruelly
from
headache
and
would
ask
permission
to
go
to
his
chamber
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
sat
there
pretending
to
sip
his
wine
with
herbert
fitzgerald
after
this
herbert
again
went
to
his
father
and
then
in
the
gloom
of
the
evening
he
found
somers
in
the
office
a
little
magistrate
room
that
was
used
both
by
him
and
by
sir
thomas
but
nothing
passed
between
them
herbert
had
nothing
to
tell
and
then
at
about
nine
he
also
went
up
to
his
bedroom
a
more
melancholy
day
than
that
had
never
shed
its
gloom
upon
castle
richmond
chapter
xx
two
witnesses
prendergast
had
given
himself
two
days
to
do
all
that
was
to
be
done
before
he
told
herbert
fitzgerald
the
whole
of
the
family
history
he
had
promised
that
he
would
then
let
him
know
all
that
there
was
to
be
known
and
he
had
done
so
advisedly
considering
that
it
would
be
manifestly
unjust
to
leave
him
in
the
dark
an
hour
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
to
expect
that
sir
thomas
himself
should
with
his
own
breath
and
his
own
words
make
the
revelation
either
to
his
son
or
to
his
wife
was
to
expect
a
manifest
impossibility
he
would
altogether
have
sank
under
such
an
effort
as
he
had
already
sank
under
the
effort
of
telling
it
to
prendergast
nor
could
it
be
left
to
the
judgment
of
sir
thomas
to
say
when
the
story
should
be
told
he
had
now
absolutely
abandoned
all
judgment
in
the
matter
he
had
placed
himself
in
the
hands
of
a
friend
and
he
now
expected
that
that
friend
should
do
all
that
there
was
to
be
done
prendergast
had
therefore
felt
himself
justified
in
making
this
promise
but
how
was
he
to
set
about
the
necessary
intervening
work
and
how
pass
the
intervening
hours
it
had
already
been
decided
that
abraham
mollett
when
he
called
should
be
shown
as
usual
into
the
study
but
that
he
should
there
find
himself
confronted
not
with
sir
thomas
but
with
prendergast
but
there
was
some
doubt
whether
or
no
mollett
would
come
it
might
be
that
he
had
means
of
ascertaining
what
strangers
arrived
at
castle
richmond
and
it
might
be
that
he
would
under
the
present
circumstances
think
it
expedient
to
stay
away
this
visit
however
was
not
to
take
place
till
the
second
day
after
that
on
which
prendergast
had
heard
the
story
and
in
the
meantime
he
had
that
examination
of
jones
to
arrange
and
conduct
the
breakfast
was
again
very
sad
the
girls
suggested
to
their
brother
that
he
and
prendergast
should
sit
together
by
themselves
in
a
small
breakfast
parlour
but
to
this
he
would
not
assent
nothing
could
be
more
difficult
or
embarrassing
than
a
conversation
between
himself
and
that
gentleman
and
he
moreover
was
unwilling
to
let
it
be
thought
in
the
household
that
affairs
were
going
utterly
wrong
in
the
family
on
this
matter
he
need
hardly
have
disturbed
himself
for
the
household
was
fully
convinced
that
things
were
going
very
wrong
and
can
read
the
meaning
of
heavy
brows
and
sad
faces
of
long
meetings
and
whispered
consultations
as
well
as
their
betters
the
two
girls
therefore
and
aunt
letty
appeared
at
the
but
it
was
as
though
so
many
ghosts
had
assembled
round
the
urn
immediately
after
breakfast
prendergast
applied
to
aunt
letty
miss
fitzgerald
said
he
i
think
you
have
an
old
servant
of
the
name
of
jones
living
here
yes
sure
said
aunt
letty
she
was
living
with
my
before
her
marriage
exactly
and
ever
since
too
i
believe
said
prendergast
with
a
lawyer
instinctive
desire
to
divert
suspicion
from
the
true
point
oh
yes
always
jones
is
quite
one
of
ourselves
then
would
you
do
me
the
favour
to
beg
jones
to
oblige
me
with
her
company
for
half
an
hour
or
so
there
is
an
excellent
fire
in
my
room
and
perhaps
jones
would
not
object
to
step
there
aunt
letty
promised
that
jones
should
be
sent
merely
suggesting
the
instead
of
the
and
to
the
prendergast
at
once
betook
himself
what
can
she
know
about
the
london
property
or
about
the
irish
property
thought
aunt
letty
to
herself
and
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
perhaps
all
these
troubles
arose
from
some
source
altogether
distinct
from
the
property
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
knock
came
to
the
door
and
jones
having
been
duly
summoned
entered
the
room
with
a
very
clean
cap
and
apron
and
with
a
very
low
curtsey
good
morning
jones
said
prendergast
pray
take
a
seat
and
he
pointed
to
an
that
was
comfortably
placed
near
the
fire
on
the
further
side
of
the
jones
sat
herself
down
crossed
her
hands
on
her
lap
and
looked
the
very
personification
of
meek
obedience
and
yet
there
was
something
about
her
which
seemed
to
justify
the
soubriquet
of
duchess
which
the
girls
had
given
to
her
she
had
a
certain
grandeur
about
her
cap
and
a
majestical
set
about
the
skirt
of
her
dress
and
a
rigour
in
the
lines
of
her
mouth
which
indicated
a
habit
of
command
and
a
confidence
in
her
own
dignity
which
might
be
supposed
to
be
the
very
clearest
attribute
of
duchessdom
you
have
been
in
this
family
a
long
time
i
am
told
jones
said
prendergast
using
his
pleasantest
voice
a
very
long
time
indeed
said
jones
and
in
a
very
confidential
situation
too
i
am
told
by
sir
thomas
that
pretty
nearly
the
whole
management
of
the
house
is
left
in
your
hands
sir
thomas
is
very
kind
sir
sir
thomas
always
was
very
kind
poor
gentleman
poor
gentleman
indeed
you
may
well
say
that
jones
this
family
is
in
great
affliction
you
are
no
doubt
aware
of
that
and
prendergast
as
he
spoke
got
up
went
to
the
door
and
saw
that
it
was
firmly
closed
jones
acknowledged
that
she
was
aware
of
it
it
was
impossible
she
said
for
servants
to
shut
their
eyes
to
things
if
they
tried
ever
so
of
course
of
course
said
prendergast
and
particularly
for
a
person
so
attached
to
them
all
as
you
are
well
pendrergrass
i
am
attached
to
them
certainly
i
have
seed
all
born
sir
that
is
the
young
ladies
and
herbert
and
as
for
her
ladyship
i
did
see
her
born
in
course
for
both
of
an
age
but
it
comes
much
to
the
same
thing
like
exactly
exactly
you
are
quite
one
of
themselves
as
sir
sister
said
to
me
just
now
jones
is
quite
one
of
ourselves
those
were
her
very
words
i
sure
i
much
obliged
to
miss
letty
well
as
i
was
saying
a
great
sorrow
has
come
upon
them
all
jones
now
will
you
tell
me
this
do
you
know
what
it
is
can
you
guess
at
all
do
the
servants
know
down
stairs
i
rather
not
be
guessing
on
any
such
matters
pendrergrass
and
as
for
them
if
they
were
impudent
enough
for
the
like
never
dare
to
tell
me
them
irish
servants
is
very
impudent
betimes
only
they
good
at
the
heart
too
and
there
is
one
hurt
a
dog
belonging
to
the
family
i
am
sure
they
would
not
said
prendergast
but
you
yourself
you
do
know
what
this
trouble
is
not
a
know
said
jones
looking
down
and
smoothing
her
apron
well
now
of
course
you
understand
jones
and
i
must
explain
this
to
you
to
account
for
my
questions
of
course
you
understand
that
i
am
here
as
sir
thomas
friend
to
set
certain
matters
right
for
him
if
i
can
i
supposed
as
much
as
that
if
you
please
sir
and
any
questions
that
i
may
ask
you
i
ask
altogether
on
his
behalf
on
his
behalf
and
on
that
of
his
wife
lady
fitzgerald
i
tell
you
that
you
may
have
no
scruples
as
to
answering
me
oh
sir
i
have
no
scruples
as
to
that
but
of
course
sir
in
anything
i
say
i
must
be
guided
by
by
by
your
own
judgment
you
were
going
to
say
yes
sir
begging
pardon
for
mentioning
such
a
thing
to
the
likes
of
you
sir
quite
right
quite
right
everybody
should
use
their
own
judgment
in
everything
they
do
or
say
more
or
less
but
now
jones
i
want
to
know
this
you
remember
her
ladyship
first
marriage
i
dare
say
yes
sir
i
remember
it
said
jones
shaking
her
head
it
was
a
sad
affair
was
it
i
remember
it
well
though
i
was
very
young
then
so
were
you
too
mrs
jones
young
enough
surely
sir
and
foolish
enough
too
we
were
the
most
of
us
that
then
sir
true
true
so
we
were
but
you
remember
the
man
do
you
her
ladyship
husband
talbot
he
called
himself
and
prendergast
took
some
trouble
to
look
as
though
he
did
not
at
all
wish
to
frighten
her
yes
i
do
remember
him
this
she
said
after
a
considerable
pause
but
it
is
a
very
long
time
ago
you
know
mr
pendrergrass
a
very
long
time
but
i
am
sure
you
do
remember
you
lived
in
the
house
you
know
for
some
months
yes
i
did
he
was
my
master
for
three
months
or
thereabouts
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
got
my
wages
for
those
three
months
yet
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
do
you
believe
now
jones
that
that
talbot
is
still
alive
he
asked
the
question
in
a
very
soft
voice
and
endeavoured
not
to
startle
her
by
his
look
as
he
did
so
but
it
was
necessary
to
his
purpose
that
he
should
keep
his
eye
upon
her
half
the
answer
to
his
question
was
to
be
conveyed
by
the
effect
on
the
muscles
of
her
face
which
that
question
would
produce
she
might
perhaps
command
her
voice
to
tell
a
falsehood
but
be
unable
to
command
her
face
to
support
it
believe
what
sir
said
she
and
the
lawyer
could
immediately
perceive
that
she
did
believe
and
probably
knew
that
that
man
who
had
called
himself
talbot
was
still
alive
do
you
believe
jones
that
he
is
alive
her
ladyship
former
husband
you
know
the
question
was
so
terrible
in
its
nature
that
jones
absolutely
shook
under
it
did
she
think
that
that
man
was
still
alive
why
if
she
thought
that
what
was
she
to
think
of
her
ladyship
it
was
in
that
manner
that
she
would
have
answered
the
question
had
she
known
how
but
she
did
not
know
she
had
therefore
to
look
about
her
for
some
other
words
which
might
be
equally
evasive
those
which
she
selected
served
her
turn
just
as
well
lord
bless
you
sir
she
said
it
was
not
that
the
words
were
expressive
but
the
tone
was
decidedly
so
it
was
as
though
she
said
how
can
that
man
be
alive
who
has
been
dead
these
twenty
years
and
more
but
nevertheless
she
was
giving
evidence
all
the
time
against
the
cause
of
her
poor
mistress
you
think
then
that
he
is
dead
dead
sir
oh
laws
why
should
he
be
dead
and
then
there
was
a
pause
between
them
for
a
couple
of
minutes
jones
said
prendergast
when
he
had
well
considered
the
matter
my
belief
is
that
your
only
object
and
wish
is
to
do
good
to
your
master
and
mistress
surely
sir
surely
it
would
be
my
bounden
duty
to
do
them
good
if
i
knew
how
i
will
tell
you
how
speak
out
to
me
the
whole
truth
openly
and
freely
i
am
here
as
the
friend
of
sir
thomas
and
of
her
ladyship
he
has
sent
to
me
that
i
may
advise
him
what
to
do
in
a
great
trouble
that
has
befallen
him
and
i
can
not
give
him
good
advice
till
i
know
the
truth
what
good
could
it
do
him
poor
gentleman
to
know
that
that
man
is
alive
it
will
do
him
good
to
know
the
truth
to
know
whether
he
be
alive
or
no
until
he
knows
that
he
can
not
act
properly
poor
gentleman
poor
gentleman
said
jones
putting
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
eyes
if
you
have
any
information
in
this
matter
and
i
think
you
have
jones
or
even
any
suspicion
it
is
your
duty
to
tell
me
well
sir
i
sure
i
do
say
against
that
you
are
sir
friend
to
be
sure
and
no
doubt
you
know
best
and
i
a
poor
ignorant
woman
but
to
speak
candidly
sir
i
do
feel
myself
free
to
talk
on
this
matter
i
have
never
made
nor
marred
since
been
in
this
family
not
in
such
matters
as
them
what
i
seed
i
kep
to
myself
and
when
i
had
my
suspecs
as
a
woman
ca
but
have
i
kep
them
to
myself
also
and
saving
your
presence
sir
and
meaning
no
offence
to
a
gentleman
like
you
and
here
she
got
up
from
her
chair
and
made
another
curtsey
i
think
i
liefer
hold
my
tongue
than
say
anything
more
on
this
matter
and
then
she
remained
standing
as
though
she
expected
permission
to
retire
but
there
was
still
another
pause
and
prendergast
sat
looking
at
the
fire
do
you
know
at
last
he
said
with
almost
an
angry
voice
that
the
man
was
here
in
this
house
last
week
and
now
he
turned
round
at
her
and
looked
her
full
in
the
face
he
did
not
however
know
jones
it
might
be
difficult
to
coax
her
into
free
communication
but
it
was
altogether
out
of
his
power
to
frighten
her
into
it
what
i
knows
sir
i
knows
said
she
and
what
i
do
know
i
do
know
and
if
you
please
sir
lady
fitzgerald
she
my
missus
and
if
i
to
be
said
anything
more
to
about
this
here
matter
why
i
choose
that
her
ladyship
should
be
by
and
then
she
made
a
little
motion
as
though
to
walk
towards
the
door
but
prendergast
managed
to
stop
her
but
we
want
to
spare
lady
fitzgerald
if
we
can
at
any
rate
for
a
while
said
he
you
would
not
wish
to
bring
more
sorrow
upon
her
would
you
god
forbid
pendrergrass
and
if
i
could
take
the
sorrow
from
her
heart
i
would
willingly
and
bear
it
myself
to
the
grave
for
her
ladyship
has
been
a
good
lady
to
me
but
no
good
never
did
come
and
never
will
of
servants
talking
of
their
missusses
and
so
if
you
please
sir
i
make
bold
to
and
again
she
made
an
attempt
to
reach
the
door
but
prendergast
was
not
yet
persuaded
that
he
could
not
get
from
the
good
old
woman
the
information
that
he
wanted
and
he
was
persuaded
that
she
had
the
information
if
only
she
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
impart
it
so
he
again
stopped
her
though
on
this
occasion
she
made
some
slight
attempt
to
pass
him
by
as
she
did
so
i
think
said
she
that
there
will
be
much
use
in
my
staying
here
longer
wait
half
a
minute
jones
just
half
a
minute
if
i
could
only
make
you
understand
how
we
are
all
circumstanced
here
and
i
tell
you
what
though
you
will
trust
me
with
nothing
i
will
trust
you
with
everything
i
do
want
no
trust
sir
not
about
all
this
but
listen
to
me
sir
thomas
has
reason
to
believe
nay
he
feels
quite
sure
that
this
man
is
alive
poor
gentleman
poor
gentleman
and
has
been
here
in
this
house
two
or
three
times
within
the
last
month
sir
thomas
is
full
sure
of
this
now
can
you
tell
me
whether
the
man
who
did
come
was
this
talbot
or
was
not
if
you
can
answer
that
positively
either
one
way
or
the
other
you
will
do
a
service
to
the
whole
family
which
shall
not
go
unrewarded
i
do
want
no
reward
sir
ask
me
to
tattle
of
them
for
rewards
after
thirty
years
and
she
put
her
apron
up
to
her
eyes
well
then
for
the
good
of
the
family
can
you
say
positively
that
the
man
who
came
here
to
your
master
was
talbot
or
that
he
was
not
indeed
then
sir
i
ca
say
anything
positively
nor
for
that
matter
not
impositively
either
and
then
she
shut
herself
up
doggedly
and
sat
with
compressed
lips
determined
to
resist
all
the
lawyer
arts
prendergast
did
not
immediately
give
up
the
game
but
he
failed
in
learning
from
her
any
more
than
what
she
had
already
told
him
he
felt
confident
that
she
did
know
the
secret
of
this
man
existence
and
presence
in
the
south
of
ireland
but
he
was
forced
to
satisfy
himself
with
that
conviction
so
he
let
her
go
giving
her
his
hand
as
she
went
in
token
of
respect
and
receiving
her
demure
curtsey
with
his
kindest
smile
it
may
be
thought
he
to
himself
that
i
have
not
done
with
her
yet
and
then
he
passed
another
tedious
day
a
day
that
was
terribly
tedious
to
them
all
he
paid
a
visit
to
sir
thomas
but
as
that
arrangement
about
mollett
visit
had
been
made
between
them
it
was
not
necessary
that
anything
should
be
done
or
said
about
the
business
on
hand
it
was
understood
that
further
action
was
to
be
stayed
till
that
visit
was
over
and
therefore
for
the
present
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
sir
thomas
he
did
not
see
lady
fitzgerald
throughout
the
whole
day
and
it
appeared
to
him
not
unnaturally
that
she
purposely
kept
out
of
his
way
anticipating
evil
from
his
coming
he
took
a
walk
with
herbert
and
somers
and
was
driven
as
far
as
the
and
mill
at
berry
hill
inquiring
into
the
state
of
the
poor
or
rather
pretending
to
inquire
it
was
a
pretence
with
them
all
for
at
the
present
moment
their
minds
were
intent
on
other
things
and
then
there
was
that
terrible
dinner
that
mockery
of
a
meal
at
which
the
three
ladies
were
constrained
to
appear
but
at
which
they
found
it
impossible
to
eat
or
to
speak
somers
had
been
asked
to
join
the
party
so
that
the
scene
after
dinner
might
be
less
painful
but
even
he
felt
that
he
could
not
talk
as
was
his
ordinary
wont
horrible
suspicions
of
the
truth
had
gradually
come
upon
him
and
with
a
suspicion
of
such
a
truth
of
such
a
tragedy
in
the
very
household
how
could
he
or
how
could
any
one
hold
a
conversation
and
then
at
about
nine
prendergast
was
again
in
his
on
the
next
morning
he
was
early
with
sir
thomas
persuading
him
to
relinquish
altogether
the
use
of
his
study
for
that
day
on
that
evening
they
were
to
have
another
interview
there
in
which
prendergast
was
to
tell
his
friend
the
result
of
what
had
been
done
and
then
he
had
to
arrange
certain
manoeuvring
with
the
servants
in
which
he
was
forced
to
obtain
the
assistance
of
herbert
mollett
was
to
be
introduced
into
the
study
immediately
on
his
arrival
and
this
was
to
be
done
in
such
a
manner
that
jones
might
assuredly
be
ignorant
of
his
arrival
on
this
duty
our
old
friend
richard
was
employed
and
it
was
contrived
that
jones
should
be
kept
upstairs
with
her
mistress
all
this
was
difficult
enough
but
he
could
not
explain
even
to
herbert
the
reason
why
such
scheming
was
necessary
herbert
however
obeyed
in
silence
knowing
that
something
dreadful
was
about
to
fall
on
them
immediately
after
breakfast
prendergast
betook
himself
to
the
study
and
there
remained
with
his
london
newspaper
in
his
hand
a
dozen
times
he
began
a
leading
article
in
which
the
law
was
laid
down
with
great
perspicuity
and
certainty
as
to
the
present
state
of
ireland
but
had
the
writer
been
treating
of
the
sandwich
islands
he
could
not
have
attracted
less
of
his
attention
he
found
it
impossible
to
read
on
that
evening
he
would
have
to
reveal
to
herbert
fitzgerald
what
was
to
be
his
fate
matthew
mollett
at
his
last
interview
with
sir
thomas
had
promised
to
call
on
this
day
and
had
been
counting
the
days
till
that
one
should
arrive
on
which
he
might
keep
his
promise
he
was
terribly
in
want
of
cash
and
as
we
all
know
aby
had
entirely
failed
in
raising
the
wind
any
immediate
fund
of
wind
on
the
occasion
of
his
visit
to
the
baronet
and
now
when
this
morning
came
old
mollett
was
early
on
the
road
aby
had
talked
of
going
with
him
but
aby
had
failed
so
signally
on
the
occasion
of
the
visit
which
he
did
make
to
castle
richmond
that
he
had
been
without
the
moral
strength
to
persist
in
his
purpose
then
i
shall
write
to
the
baronet
and
go
alone
to
london
said
mollett
p√®re
bother
replied
mollett
fils
you
hai
got
the
cash
governor
i
got
what
take
me
there
my
boy
whether
you
know
it
or
not
and
sir
thomas
be
ready
enough
to
send
me
a
remittance
when
once
out
of
this
country
and
so
aby
had
given
way
partly
perhaps
in
terror
of
countenance
and
matthew
mollett
started
again
in
a
covered
car
on
that
cold
journey
over
the
boggeragh
mountains
it
was
still
being
now
about
the
end
of
february
and
the
country
was
colder
and
wetter
and
more
wretched
and
the
people
in
that
desolate
district
more
ragged
and
more
starved
than
when
he
had
last
crossed
it
but
what
were
their
rags
and
starvation
to
him
he
was
worse
off
than
they
were
they
were
merely
dying
as
all
men
must
do
but
he
was
inhabiting
a
hell
on
earth
which
no
man
need
do
they
came
out
to
him
in
shoals
begging
but
they
came
in
vain
getting
nothing
from
him
but
a
curse
through
his
chattering
teeth
what
right
had
they
to
torment
with
their
misery
one
so
much
more
wretched
than
themselves
at
a
little
before
twelve
the
covered
car
was
at
the
front
door
of
castle
richmond
house
and
there
was
richard
under
the
porch
on
former
occasions
mollett
had
experienced
some
little
delay
in
making
his
way
into
the
baronet
presence
the
servants
had
looked
cold
upon
him
and
he
had
felt
as
though
there
might
be
hot
ploughshares
under
his
feet
at
any
step
which
he
took
but
now
everything
seemed
to
be
made
easy
richard
took
him
in
tow
without
a
moment
delay
told
him
confidentially
that
sir
thomas
was
waiting
for
him
bade
the
covered
car
to
be
driven
round
into
the
yard
with
a
voice
that
was
uncommonly
civil
seeing
that
it
was
addressed
to
a
cork
carman
and
then
ushered
mollett
through
the
hall
and
down
the
passage
without
one
moment
delay
wretched
as
he
had
been
during
his
journey
wretched
as
an
infernal
spirit
his
hopes
were
now
again
elated
and
he
dreamed
of
a
golden
paradise
there
was
something
pleasant
in
feeling
his
mastery
over
that
poor
old
shattered
baronet
the
gentleman
to
wait
upon
sir
thomas
said
richard
opening
the
study
door
and
then
mollett
senior
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
prendergast
prendergast
was
sitting
in
a
easy
chair
facing
the
fire
when
the
announcement
was
made
and
therefore
mollett
still
fancied
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
sir
thomas
until
he
was
well
into
the
room
and
the
door
was
closed
upon
him
otherwise
he
might
probably
have
turned
on
his
heels
and
bolted
he
had
had
three
or
four
interviews
with
prendergast
having
received
different
sums
of
money
from
that
gentleman
hands
and
had
felt
on
all
such
occasions
that
he
was
being
looked
through
and
through
prendergast
had
asked
but
few
questions
never
going
into
the
matter
of
his
mollett
pecuniary
connexion
with
sir
thomas
but
there
had
always
been
that
in
the
lawyer
eye
which
had
frightened
the
miscreant
which
had
quelled
his
bluster
as
soon
as
it
was
assumed
and
had
told
him
that
he
was
known
for
a
blackguard
and
a
scoundrel
and
now
when
this
man
with
the
terrible
gray
eye
got
up
from
sir
thomas
chair
and
wheeling
round
confronted
him
looking
him
full
in
the
face
and
frowning
on
him
as
an
honest
man
does
frown
on
an
unconvicted
rascal
when
i
say
this
happened
to
mollett
senior
he
thoroughly
at
that
moment
wished
himself
back
in
london
he
turned
his
eye
round
to
the
door
but
that
was
closed
behind
him
he
looked
around
to
see
whether
sir
thomas
was
there
but
no
one
was
in
the
room
with
him
but
prendergast
then
he
stood
still
and
as
that
gentleman
did
not
address
him
he
was
obliged
to
speak
the
silence
was
too
awful
for
him
oh
mr
prendergast
said
he
is
that
you
yes
mollett
it
is
i
oh
ah
i
suppose
you
are
here
about
business
of
your
own
i
was
wishing
to
see
sir
thomas
about
a
little
business
of
my
own
maybe
he
not
in
the
way
no
he
is
not
not
exactly
but
perhaps
mollett
i
can
do
as
well
you
have
known
me
before
you
know
and
you
may
say
to
me
openly
anything
you
have
to
say
to
sir
thomas
well
i
do
know
about
that
sir
my
business
is
with
the
baronet
particular
mollett
as
he
spoke
strained
every
nerve
to
do
so
without
appearance
of
dismay
but
his
efforts
were
altogether
ineffectual
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
look
prendergast
in
the
face
for
a
moment
or
avoid
feeling
like
a
dog
that
dreads
being
kicked
all
manner
of
fears
came
upon
him
and
he
would
at
the
moment
have
given
up
all
his
hopes
of
money
from
the
castle
richmond
people
to
have
been
free
from
prendergast
and
his
influence
and
yet
mollett
was
not
a
coward
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
indeed
he
had
been
very
daring
in
the
whole
management
of
this
affair
but
then
a
course
of
crime
makes
such
violent
demands
on
a
man
courage
let
any
one
think
of
the
difference
of
attacking
a
thief
and
being
attacked
as
a
thief
we
are
apt
to
call
bad
men
cowards
without
much
consideration
mollett
was
not
without
pluck
but
his
pluck
was
now
quelled
the
circumstances
were
too
strong
against
him
listen
to
me
mollett
and
look
here
sir
never
mind
turning
to
the
door
you
ca
go
now
till
you
and
i
have
had
some
conversation
you
may
make
up
your
mind
to
this
you
will
never
see
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
again
unless
indeed
he
should
be
in
the
when
you
are
standing
in
the
dock
prendergast
sir
well
have
you
any
reason
to
give
why
you
should
not
be
put
in
the
dock
how
much
money
have
you
got
from
sir
thomas
during
the
last
two
years
by
means
of
those
threats
which
you
have
been
using
you
were
well
aware
when
you
set
about
this
business
that
you
were
committing
felony
and
have
probably
felt
tolerably
sure
at
times
that
you
would
some
day
be
brought
up
short
that
day
has
come
prendergast
had
made
up
his
mind
that
nothing
could
be
gained
by
soft
usage
with
mollett
indeed
nothing
could
be
gained
in
any
way
by
any
usage
unless
it
could
be
shown
that
mollett
and
talbot
were
not
the
same
person
he
could
afford
therefore
to
tell
the
scoundrel
that
he
was
a
scoundrel
and
to
declare
against
him
war
to
the
knife
the
more
that
mollett
trembled
the
more
abject
he
became
the
easier
would
be
the
task
prendergast
now
had
in
hand
well
sir
he
continued
are
you
going
to
tell
me
what
business
has
brought
you
here
but
mollett
though
he
did
shake
in
his
shoes
did
not
look
at
the
matter
exactly
in
the
same
light
he
could
not
believe
that
sir
thomas
would
himself
throw
up
the
game
on
any
consideration
or
that
prendergast
as
his
friend
would
throw
it
up
on
his
behalf
he
mollett
had
a
strong
feeling
that
he
could
have
continued
to
deal
easily
with
sir
thomas
and
that
it
might
be
very
hard
to
deal
at
all
with
prendergast
but
nevertheless
the
game
was
still
open
prendergast
would
probably
distrust
the
fact
of
his
being
the
husband
and
it
would
be
for
him
therefore
to
use
the
indubitable
proofs
of
the
facts
that
were
in
his
possession
sir
thomas
knows
very
well
what
i
come
about
he
began
slowly
and
if
he
told
you
why
you
know
too
and
in
that
case
but
what
might
or
might
not
happen
in
that
case
mollett
had
not
now
an
opportunity
of
explaining
for
the
door
opened
and
jones
entered
the
room
when
that
man
comes
this
morning
prendergast
had
said
to
herbert
i
must
get
you
to
induce
jones
to
come
to
us
in
the
study
as
soon
as
may
be
he
had
not
at
all
explained
to
herbert
why
this
was
necessary
nor
had
he
been
at
any
pains
to
prevent
the
young
heir
from
thinking
and
feeling
that
some
terrible
mystery
hung
over
the
house
there
was
a
terrible
mystery
which
indeed
would
be
more
terrible
still
when
it
ceased
to
be
mysterious
he
therefore
quietly
explained
to
herbert
what
he
desired
to
have
done
and
herbert
awaiting
the
promised
communication
of
that
evening
quietly
did
as
he
was
bid
you
must
go
down
to
him
jones
he
had
said
but
i
rather
not
sir
i
was
with
him
yesterday
for
two
mortal
hours
and
oh
herbert
it
ai
for
no
good
but
herbert
was
inexorable
and
jones
feeling
herself
overcome
by
the
weight
of
the
misfortune
that
was
oppressing
them
all
obeyed
and
descending
to
her
master
study
knocked
at
the
door
she
knew
that
prendergast
was
there
and
she
knew
that
sir
thomas
was
not
but
she
did
not
know
that
any
stranger
was
in
the
room
with
prendergast
mollett
had
not
heard
the
knock
nor
indeed
had
prendergast
but
jones
having
gone
through
this
ceremony
opened
the
door
and
entered
sir
thomas
knows
does
he
said
prendergast
when
mollett
ceased
to
speak
on
the
woman
entrance
oh
jones
good
morning
here
is
your
old
master
mr
talbot
mollett
of
course
turned
round
and
found
himself
confronted
with
the
woman
they
stared
at
each
other
for
some
moments
and
then
mollett
said
in
a
low
dull
voice
yes
she
knows
me
it
was
she
that
lived
with
her
at
tallyho
lodge
you
remember
him
now
jones
do
you
said
prendergast
for
another
moment
or
two
jones
stood
silent
and
then
she
acknowledged
herself
overcome
and
felt
that
the
world
around
her
had
become
too
much
for
her
yes
said
she
slowly
i
remembers
him
and
then
sinking
into
a
chair
near
the
door
she
put
her
apron
up
to
her
eyes
and
burst
into
tears
no
doubt
about
that
she
remembers
me
well
enough
said
mollett
thinking
that
this
was
so
much
gained
on
his
side
but
there
a
doubt
about
the
matter
at
all
prendergast
you
look
here
and
you
see
it
all
as
plain
as
black
and
white
and
mollett
dragged
a
large
from
his
coat
and
took
out
of
it
certain
documents
which
he
held
before
prendergast
eyes
still
keeping
them
in
his
own
hand
oh
i
all
right
i
am
said
mollett
oh
you
are
are
you
said
the
lawyer
just
glancing
at
the
paper
which
he
would
not
appear
to
heed
i
am
glad
you
think
so
if
there
were
any
doubt
about
it
she
know
said
he
pointing
away
up
towards
the
body
of
the
house
both
prendergast
and
jones
understood
well
who
was
that
she
to
whom
he
alluded
you
are
satisfied
at
any
rate
jones
said
the
lawyer
but
jones
had
hidden
her
face
in
her
apron
and
would
not
look
up
she
could
not
understand
why
this
friend
of
the
family
should
push
the
matter
so
dreadfully
against
them
if
he
would
rise
from
his
chair
and
destroy
that
wretch
who
stood
before
them
then
indeed
he
might
be
called
a
friend
prendergast
had
now
betaken
himself
to
the
door
and
was
standing
with
his
back
to
it
and
with
his
hands
in
his
close
to
the
chair
on
which
jones
was
sitting
he
had
resolved
that
he
would
get
that
woman
spoken
evidence
out
of
her
and
he
had
gotten
it
but
now
what
was
he
to
do
with
her
next
with
her
or
with
the
late
talbot
of
tallyho
lodge
and
having
satisfied
himself
of
that
fact
which
from
the
commencement
he
had
never
doubted
what
could
he
best
do
to
spare
the
poor
lady
who
was
so
terribly
implicated
in
this
man
presence
jones
said
he
standing
over
her
and
gently
touching
her
shoulder
i
am
sorry
to
have
pained
you
in
this
way
but
it
was
necessary
that
we
should
know
without
a
doubt
who
this
man
is
and
who
he
was
truth
is
always
the
best
you
know
so
good
a
woman
as
you
can
not
but
understand
that
i
suppose
it
is
sir
i
suppose
it
is
said
jones
through
her
tears
now
thoroughly
humbled
the
world
was
pretty
nearly
at
an
end
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
here
in
this
very
house
of
castle
richmond
in
sir
thomas
own
room
was
her
ladyship
former
husband
acknowledged
as
such
what
further
fall
of
the
planet
into
broken
fragments
could
terrify
or
drive
her
from
her
course
more
thoroughly
than
this
truth
yes
truth
in
the
abstract
might
be
very
good
but
such
a
truth
as
this
how
could
any
one
ever
say
that
that
was
good
such
was
the
working
of
her
mind
but
she
took
no
trouble
to
express
her
thoughts
yes
continued
prendergast
speaking
still
in
a
low
voice
with
a
tone
that
was
almost
tender
truth
is
always
best
look
at
this
wretched
man
here
he
would
have
killed
the
whole
family
destroyed
them
one
by
one
had
they
consented
to
assist
him
in
concealing
the
fact
of
his
existence
the
whole
truth
will
now
be
known
and
it
is
very
dreadful
but
it
will
not
be
so
dreadful
as
the
want
of
truth
my
poor
lady
my
poor
lady
almost
screamed
jones
from
under
her
apron
wagging
her
head
and
becoming
almost
convulsive
in
her
grief
yes
it
is
very
sad
but
you
will
live
to
acknowledge
that
even
this
is
better
than
living
in
that
man
power
i
do
know
that
said
mollett
i
am
not
so
bad
as
you
make
me
i
do
want
to
distress
the
lady
no
not
if
you
are
allowed
to
rob
the
gentleman
till
there
not
a
guinea
left
for
you
to
suck
at
i
know
pretty
well
the
extent
of
the
evil
that
in
you
if
we
were
to
kick
you
from
here
to
cork
forgive
all
that
so
that
we
still
allowed
you
to
go
on
with
your
trade
i
wonder
how
much
money
you
had
from
him
altogether
what
does
the
money
signify
what
does
the
money
signify
said
jones
still
wagging
her
head
beneath
her
apron
why
did
sir
thomas
go
on
paying
it
and
then
my
lady
need
know
nothing
about
it
it
was
clear
that
jones
would
not
look
at
the
matter
in
a
proper
light
as
far
as
she
could
see
there
was
no
reason
why
a
fair
bargain
should
not
have
been
made
between
mollett
and
sir
thomas
made
and
kept
on
both
sides
with
mutual
convenience
that
doing
of
justice
at
the
cost
of
falling
heavens
was
not
intelligible
to
her
limited
philosophy
nor
did
she
bethink
herself
that
a
leech
will
not
give
over
sucking
until
it
be
gorged
with
blood
prendergast
knew
that
such
leeches
as
mollett
never
leave
the
skin
as
long
as
there
is
a
drop
of
blood
left
within
the
veins
prendergast
was
still
standing
against
the
door
where
he
had
placed
himself
to
prevent
the
unauthorized
departure
of
either
jones
or
mollett
but
now
he
was
bethinking
himself
that
he
might
as
well
bring
this
interview
to
an
end
mollett
said
he
you
are
probably
beginning
to
understand
that
you
will
not
get
much
more
money
from
the
castle
richmond
family
i
do
want
to
do
any
harm
to
any
of
them
said
mollett
humbly
and
if
i
do
make
myself
troublesome
i
hope
sir
thomas
will
consider
me
it
is
out
of
your
power
sir
to
do
any
further
harm
to
any
of
them
you
do
pretend
to
think
that
after
what
has
passed
you
can
have
any
personal
authority
over
that
unfortunate
lady
my
poor
mistress
my
poor
mistress
sobbed
jones
you
can
not
do
more
injury
than
you
at
present
have
done
no
one
is
now
afraid
of
you
no
one
here
will
ever
give
you
another
shilling
when
and
in
what
form
you
will
be
prosecuted
for
inducing
sir
thomas
to
give
you
money
i
can
not
yet
tell
now
you
may
go
and
i
strongly
advise
you
never
to
show
your
face
here
again
if
the
people
about
here
knew
who
you
are
and
what
you
are
they
would
not
let
you
off
the
property
with
a
whole
bone
in
your
skin
now
go
sir
do
you
hear
me
upon
my
word
prendergast
i
have
not
intended
any
harm
go
sir
and
even
now
prendergast
it
can
all
be
made
straight
and
i
will
leave
the
country
altogether
if
you
wish
it
go
sir
shouted
prendergast
if
you
do
not
move
at
once
i
will
ring
the
bell
for
the
servants
then
if
misfortune
comes
upon
them
it
is
your
doing
and
not
mine
said
mollett
oh
pendrergrass
if
it
can
be
hushed
up
said
jones
rising
from
her
chair
and
coming
up
to
him
with
her
hands
clasped
together
do
send
him
away
in
your
anger
now
sir
think
of
her
ladyship
do
do
do
and
the
woman
took
hold
of
his
arm
and
looked
up
into
his
face
with
her
eyes
swimming
with
tears
then
going
to
the
door
she
closed
it
and
returning
again
touched
his
arm
and
again
appealed
to
him
think
of
herbert
sir
and
the
young
ladies
what
are
they
to
be
called
sir
if
this
man
is
to
be
my
lady
husband
oh
pendrergrass
let
him
go
away
out
of
the
kingdom
do
let
him
go
away
i
be
off
to
australia
by
the
next
boat
if
you
only
say
the
word
said
mollett
to
give
him
his
due
he
was
not
at
that
moment
thinking
altogether
of
himself
and
of
what
he
might
get
the
idea
of
the
misery
which
he
had
brought
on
these
people
did
to
a
certain
measure
come
home
to
him
and
it
certainly
did
come
home
to
him
also
that
his
own
position
was
very
perilous
jones
said
the
lawyer
seeming
to
pay
no
attention
whatever
to
mollett
words
you
know
nothing
of
such
men
as
that
if
i
were
to
take
him
at
his
word
now
he
would
turn
upon
sir
thomas
again
before
three
weeks
were
over
by
i
would
not
by
all
that
is
holy
i
would
not
prendergast
do
mollett
i
will
trouble
you
to
walk
out
of
this
house
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
to
you
oh
very
well
sir
and
then
slowly
mollett
took
his
departure
and
finding
his
covered
car
at
the
door
got
into
it
without
saying
another
word
to
any
of
the
castle
richmond
family
jones
said
prendergast
as
soon
as
mollett
was
gone
i
believe
i
need
not
trouble
you
any
further
your
conduct
has
done
you
great
honour
and
i
respect
you
greatly
as
an
honest
woman
and
an
affectionate
friend
jones
could
only
acknowledge
this
by
loud
sobs
for
the
present
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
say
nothing
of
this
to
your
mistress
no
sir
no
i
shall
say
nothing
oh
dear
oh
dear
the
whole
matter
will
be
known
soon
but
in
the
mean
time
we
may
as
well
remain
silent
good
day
to
you
and
then
jones
also
left
the
room
and
prendergast
was
alone
chapter
xxi
fair
arguments
as
mollett
left
the
house
he
saw
two
men
walking
down
the
road
away
from
the
sweep
before
the
hall
door
and
as
he
passed
them
he
recognised
one
as
the
young
gentleman
of
the
house
he
also
saw
that
a
horse
followed
behind
them
on
the
grass
by
the
roadside
not
led
by
the
hand
but
following
with
the
reins
laid
loose
upon
his
neck
they
took
no
notice
of
him
or
his
car
but
allowed
him
to
pass
as
though
he
had
no
concern
whatever
with
the
destinies
of
either
of
them
they
were
herbert
and
owen
fitzgerald
the
reader
will
perhaps
remember
the
way
in
which
owen
left
desmond
court
on
the
occasion
of
his
last
visit
there
it
can
not
be
said
that
what
he
had
heard
had
in
any
way
humbled
him
nor
indeed
had
it
taught
him
to
think
that
clara
desmond
looked
at
him
altogether
with
indifference
greatly
as
she
had
injured
him
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
look
upon
her
as
the
chief
sinner
it
was
lady
desmond
who
had
done
it
all
it
was
she
who
had
turned
against
him
because
of
his
poverty
who
had
sold
her
daughter
to
his
rich
cousin
and
robbed
him
of
the
love
which
he
had
won
for
himself
or
perhaps
not
of
the
love
it
might
be
that
this
was
yet
his
and
if
so
was
it
not
possible
that
he
might
beat
the
countess
at
her
own
weapons
thinking
over
this
he
felt
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
do
something
to
take
some
step
and
therefore
he
resolved
to
go
boldly
to
his
cousin
and
tell
him
that
he
regarded
lady
clara
desmond
as
still
his
own
on
this
morning
therefore
he
had
ridden
up
to
the
castle
richmond
door
it
was
now
many
months
since
he
had
been
there
and
he
was
no
longer
entitled
to
enter
the
house
on
the
acknowledged
intimate
footing
of
a
cousin
he
rode
up
and
asked
the
servant
with
grave
ceremony
whether
herbert
fitzgerald
were
at
home
he
would
not
go
in
he
said
but
if
herbert
were
there
he
would
wait
for
him
at
the
porch
herbert
at
the
time
was
standing
in
the
all
alone
gloomily
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
during
the
whole
of
that
day
but
wait
for
the
evening
when
the
promised
revelation
would
be
made
to
him
he
knew
that
mollett
and
jones
were
with
prendergast
in
the
study
but
what
was
the
matter
now
being
investigated
between
them
that
he
did
not
know
and
till
he
knew
that
closely
as
he
was
himself
concerned
he
could
meddle
with
nothing
but
it
was
already
past
noon
and
the
evening
would
soon
be
there
in
this
mood
he
was
interrupted
by
being
told
that
his
cousin
owen
was
at
the
door
he
wo
come
in
at
all
herbert
richard
had
said
for
richard
according
to
order
was
still
waiting
about
the
porch
but
he
says
that
you
are
to
go
to
him
there
and
then
herbert
after
considering
the
matter
for
a
moment
joined
his
cousin
at
the
front
entrance
i
want
to
speak
to
you
a
few
words
said
owen
but
as
i
hear
that
sir
thomas
is
not
well
i
will
not
go
into
the
house
perhaps
you
will
walk
with
me
as
far
as
the
lodge
never
mind
the
mare
she
will
not
go
astray
and
so
herbert
got
his
hat
and
accompanied
him
for
the
first
hundred
yards
neither
of
them
said
anything
owen
would
not
speak
of
clara
till
he
was
well
out
of
hearing
from
the
house
and
at
the
present
moment
herbert
had
not
much
inclination
to
commence
a
conversation
on
any
subject
owen
was
the
first
to
speak
herbert
said
he
i
have
been
told
that
you
are
engaged
to
marry
lady
clara
desmond
and
so
i
am
said
herbert
feeling
very
little
inclined
to
admit
of
any
question
as
to
his
privilege
in
that
respect
things
were
happening
around
him
which
might
have
heaven
only
knows
what
consequence
he
did
fear
fear
with
a
terrible
dread
that
something
might
occur
which
would
shatter
the
cup
of
his
happiness
and
rob
him
of
the
fruition
of
his
hopes
but
nothing
had
occurred
as
yet
and
so
i
am
he
said
it
is
no
wonder
that
you
should
have
heard
it
for
it
has
been
kept
no
secret
and
i
also
have
heard
of
your
visit
to
desmond
court
it
might
have
been
as
well
i
think
if
you
had
stayed
away
i
thought
differently
said
owen
frowning
blackly
i
thought
that
the
most
straightforward
thing
for
me
was
to
go
there
openly
having
announced
my
intention
and
tell
them
both
mother
and
daughter
that
i
hold
myself
as
engaged
to
lady
clara
and
that
i
hold
her
as
engaged
to
me
that
is
absurd
nonsense
she
can
not
be
engaged
to
two
persons
anything
that
interferes
with
you
you
will
of
course
think
absurd
i
think
otherwise
it
is
hardly
more
than
twelve
months
since
she
and
i
were
walking
there
together
and
then
she
promised
me
her
love
i
had
known
her
long
and
well
when
you
had
hardly
seen
her
i
knew
her
and
loved
her
and
what
is
more
she
loved
me
remember
it
is
not
i
only
that
say
so
she
said
it
herself
and
swore
that
nothing
should
change
her
i
do
not
believe
that
anything
has
changed
her
do
you
mean
to
say
that
at
present
she
cares
nothing
for
me
owen
you
must
be
mad
on
this
matter
mad
yes
of
course
if
i
think
that
any
girl
can
care
for
me
while
you
are
in
the
way
strange
as
it
may
appear
i
am
as
mad
even
as
that
there
are
people
who
will
not
sell
themselves
even
for
money
and
titles
i
say
again
that
i
do
not
believe
her
to
be
changed
she
has
been
weak
and
her
mother
has
persuaded
her
to
her
mother
rank
and
money
titles
and
property
are
everything
she
has
sold
her
daughter
and
i
have
come
to
ask
you
whether
under
such
circumstances
you
intend
to
accept
the
purchase
in
his
ordinary
mood
herbert
fitzgerald
was
by
no
means
a
quarrelsome
man
indeed
we
may
go
further
than
that
and
say
that
he
was
very
much
the
reverse
his
mind
was
argumentative
rather
than
impulsive
and
in
all
matters
he
was
readier
to
persuade
than
overcome
but
his
ordinary
nature
had
been
changed
it
was
quite
new
with
him
to
be
nervous
and
fretful
but
he
was
so
at
the
present
moment
he
was
deeply
concerned
in
the
circumstances
around
him
but
yet
had
been
allowed
no
voice
in
them
in
this
affair
that
was
so
peculiarly
his
own
this
of
his
promised
bride
he
was
determined
that
no
voice
should
be
heard
but
his
own
and
now
contrary
to
his
wont
he
was
ready
enough
to
quarrel
with
his
cousin
of
owen
we
may
say
that
he
was
a
man
prone
to
fighting
of
all
sorts
and
on
all
occasions
by
fighting
i
do
not
mean
the
resource
of
putting
an
end
to
fighting
by
the
aid
of
two
pistols
which
were
harmless
in
nineteen
cases
out
of
twenty
in
saying
that
owen
fitzgerald
was
prone
to
fight
i
do
not
allude
to
fighting
of
that
sort
i
mean
that
he
was
impulsive
and
ever
anxious
to
contend
and
conquer
to
yield
was
to
him
ignoble
even
though
he
might
know
that
he
was
yielding
to
the
right
to
strive
for
mastery
was
to
him
noble
even
though
he
strove
against
those
who
had
a
right
to
rule
and
strove
on
behalf
of
the
wrong
such
was
the
nature
of
his
mind
and
spirit
and
this
nature
had
impelled
him
to
his
present
enterprise
at
castle
richmond
but
he
had
gone
thither
with
an
unwonted
resolve
not
to
be
passionate
he
had
he
had
said
to
himself
right
on
his
side
and
he
had
purposed
to
argue
it
out
fairly
with
his
more
cousin
the
reader
may
probably
guess
the
result
of
these
fair
arguments
on
such
a
subject
and
i
have
come
to
ask
you
he
said
whether
under
such
circumstances
you
intend
to
accept
the
purchase
i
will
not
allow
you
to
speak
of
lady
desmond
in
such
language
nor
of
her
daughter
said
herbert
angrily
ah
but
herbert
you
must
allow
me
i
have
been
ill
used
in
this
matter
and
i
have
a
right
to
make
myself
heard
is
it
i
that
have
ill
used
you
i
did
not
know
before
that
gentlemen
made
loud
complaints
of
such
ill
usage
from
the
hands
of
ladies
if
the
ill
usage
as
you
please
to
call
it
it
is
your
own
word
very
well
if
this
ill
usage
came
from
clara
desmond
herself
i
should
be
the
last
person
to
complain
of
it
and
you
would
be
the
last
person
to
whom
i
should
make
complaint
but
i
feel
sure
that
it
is
not
so
she
is
acting
under
the
influence
of
her
mother
who
has
frightened
her
into
this
thing
which
she
is
doing
i
do
not
believe
that
she
is
false
herself
i
am
sure
that
she
is
not
false
we
are
quite
agreed
there
but
it
is
not
likely
that
we
should
agree
further
to
tell
you
the
truth
frankly
i
think
you
are
to
speak
to
me
on
such
a
topic
perhaps
in
that
respect
you
will
allow
me
to
think
for
myself
but
i
have
not
yet
said
that
which
i
came
to
say
my
belief
is
that
unfair
and
improper
restraint
is
put
upon
clara
desmond
that
she
has
been
induced
by
her
mother
to
accept
your
offer
in
opposition
to
her
own
wishes
and
that
therefore
it
is
my
duty
to
look
upon
her
as
still
betrothed
to
me
i
do
so
regard
her
and
shall
act
under
such
conviction
the
first
thing
that
i
do
therefore
is
to
call
upon
you
to
relinquish
your
claim
what
to
give
her
up
yes
to
give
her
up
to
acknowledge
that
you
can
not
honestly
call
upon
her
to
fulfil
her
pledge
to
you
the
man
must
be
raving
herbert
said
very
probably
but
remember
this
it
may
be
that
he
will
rave
to
some
purpose
when
such
insolence
will
be
but
of
little
avail
to
you
raving
yes
i
suppose
that
a
man
poor
as
i
am
must
be
mad
indeed
to
set
his
heart
upon
anything
that
you
may
choose
to
fancy
all
that
is
nonsense
owen
i
ask
for
nothing
but
my
own
i
won
her
love
fairly
and
i
mean
to
keep
it
firmly
you
may
possibly
have
won
her
hand
but
never
her
heart
you
are
rich
and
it
may
be
that
even
she
will
condescend
to
barter
her
hand
but
i
doubt
it
i
altogether
doubt
it
it
is
her
mother
doing
as
it
was
plain
enough
for
me
to
see
the
other
day
at
desmond
court
but
much
as
she
may
fear
her
mother
i
can
not
think
that
she
will
go
to
the
altar
with
a
lie
in
her
mouth
and
then
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
few
yards
herbert
was
anxious
to
get
back
to
the
house
and
was
by
no
means
desirous
of
continuing
this
conversation
with
his
cousin
he
at
any
rate
could
get
nothing
by
talking
about
lady
clara
desmond
to
owen
fitzgerald
he
stopped
therefore
on
the
path
and
said
that
if
owen
had
nothing
further
to
say
he
herbert
would
go
back
to
the
house
nothing
further
nothing
further
if
you
understand
me
but
you
do
not
you
are
not
honest
enough
in
this
matter
to
understand
any
purpose
but
your
own
i
tell
you
what
owen
i
did
not
come
out
here
to
hear
myself
abused
and
i
will
not
stand
it
according
to
my
idea
you
had
no
right
whatever
to
speak
to
me
about
lady
clara
desmond
but
you
are
my
cousin
and
therefore
i
have
borne
it
it
may
be
as
well
that
we
should
both
understand
that
it
is
once
for
all
i
will
not
listen
to
you
again
on
the
same
subject
oh
you
wo
upon
my
word
you
are
a
very
great
man
you
will
tell
me
next
i
suppose
that
this
is
your
demesne
and
will
warn
me
off
even
if
i
did
that
i
should
not
be
wrong
under
such
provocation
very
well
sir
then
i
will
go
off
but
remember
this
herbert
fitzgerald
you
shall
live
to
rue
the
day
when
you
treated
me
with
such
insolence
and
remember
this
also
clara
desmond
is
not
your
wife
as
yet
everything
now
seems
happy
with
you
and
fortunate
you
have
wealth
and
a
fine
house
and
a
family
round
you
while
i
am
there
all
alone
left
like
a
dog
as
far
as
my
own
relatives
are
concerned
but
yet
it
may
come
to
pass
that
the
earl
of
daughter
will
prefer
my
hand
to
yours
and
my
house
to
your
house
they
who
mount
high
may
chance
to
get
a
fall
and
then
having
uttered
this
caution
he
turned
to
his
mare
and
putting
his
hand
upon
the
saddle
jumped
into
his
seat
and
pressing
her
into
a
gallop
darted
off
across
the
grass
he
had
not
meant
anything
specially
by
his
threat
but
his
heart
was
sore
within
him
during
some
weeks
past
he
had
become
sick
of
the
life
that
he
was
leading
he
had
begun
to
hate
his
own
solitary
house
his
house
that
was
either
solitary
or
filled
with
riot
and
noise
he
sighed
for
the
quiet
hours
that
were
once
his
at
desmond
court
and
the
privilege
of
constant
entrance
there
which
was
now
denied
him
his
cousin
herbert
had
everything
at
his
command
wealth
station
family
ties
society
and
all
the
consideration
of
high
place
every
blessing
was
at
the
feet
of
the
young
heir
but
every
blessing
was
not
enough
unless
clara
desmond
was
also
added
all
this
seemed
so
cruel
to
him
as
he
sat
alone
in
his
parlour
at
hap
house
meditating
on
his
future
course
of
life
and
then
he
would
think
of
clara
promise
of
her
assurance
that
nothing
should
frighten
her
from
her
pledge
he
thought
of
this
as
though
the
words
had
been
spoken
to
him
only
yesterday
he
pondered
over
these
things
till
he
hated
his
cousin
herbert
and
hating
him
he
vowed
that
clara
desmond
should
not
be
his
wife
is
he
to
have
everything
he
would
say
to
himself
no
by
heavens
not
everything
he
has
enough
and
may
be
contented
but
he
shall
not
have
all
and
now
with
similar
thoughts
running
through
his
mind
he
rode
back
to
hap
house
and
herbert
turned
back
to
castle
richmond
as
he
approached
the
front
door
he
met
prendergast
who
was
leaving
the
house
but
they
had
no
conversation
with
each
other
herbert
was
in
hopes
that
he
might
now
at
once
be
put
out
of
suspense
mollett
was
gone
and
would
it
not
be
better
that
the
tale
should
be
told
but
it
was
clear
that
prendergast
had
no
intention
of
lessening
by
an
hour
the
interval
he
had
given
himself
he
merely
muttered
a
few
words
passing
on
and
herbert
went
into
the
house
and
then
there
was
another
long
tedious
dull
afternoon
herbert
sat
with
his
sisters
but
they
had
not
the
heart
to
talk
to
each
other
at
about
four
a
note
was
brought
to
him
it
was
from
prendergast
begging
herbert
to
meet
him
in
sir
thomas
study
at
eight
sir
thomas
had
not
been
there
during
the
day
and
now
did
not
intend
to
leave
his
own
room
they
dined
at
six
and
the
appointment
was
therefore
to
take
place
almost
immediately
after
dinner
tell
prendergast
that
i
will
be
there
he
said
to
the
servant
and
so
that
afternoon
passed
away
and
the
dinner
also
very
slowly
and
very
sadly
chapter
xxii
the
telling
of
the
tale
the
dinner
passed
away
as
the
former
dinners
had
done
and
as
soon
as
aunt
letty
got
up
prendergast
also
rose
and
touching
herbert
on
his
shoulder
whispered
into
his
ear
you
come
to
me
at
eight
then
herbert
nodded
his
head
and
when
he
was
alone
he
looked
at
his
watch
these
slow
dinners
were
not
actually
very
long
and
there
still
remained
to
him
some
of
an
hour
for
anticipation
what
was
to
be
the
nature
of
this
history
that
it
would
affect
himself
personally
in
the
closest
manner
he
could
not
but
know
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
on
the
minds
of
any
of
them
that
the
affair
was
one
of
money
and
his
father
money
questions
were
his
money
questions
prendergast
would
not
have
been
sent
for
with
reference
to
any
trifle
nor
would
any
pecuniary
difficulty
that
was
not
very
serious
have
thrown
his
father
into
such
a
state
of
misery
could
it
be
that
the
fair
inheritance
was
absolutely
in
danger
herbert
fitzgerald
was
by
no
means
a
selfish
man
as
regarded
himself
he
could
have
met
ruin
in
the
face
with
more
equanimity
than
most
young
men
so
circumstanced
the
gilt
of
the
world
had
not
eaten
into
his
soul
his
heart
was
not
as
yet
wedded
to
the
splendour
of
pinchbeck
this
is
saying
much
for
him
for
how
seldom
is
it
that
the
hearts
and
souls
of
the
young
are
able
to
withstand
pinchbeck
and
gilding
he
was
free
from
this
pusillanimity
free
as
yet
as
regarded
himself
but
he
was
hardly
free
as
regarded
his
betrothed
he
had
promised
her
not
in
spoken
words
but
in
his
thoughts
rank
wealth
and
all
the
luxuries
of
his
promised
high
position
and
now
on
her
behalf
it
nearly
broke
his
heart
to
think
that
they
might
be
endangered
of
his
mother
history
he
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
known
anything
that
there
had
been
something
tragic
in
her
early
life
that
something
had
occurred
before
his
father
marriage
and
that
his
mother
had
been
married
twice
he
had
learned
he
hardly
knew
when
or
from
whom
but
on
such
matters
there
had
never
been
conversation
between
him
and
any
of
his
own
family
and
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
all
this
sorrow
arose
in
any
way
from
this
subject
that
his
father
had
taken
some
fatal
step
with
regard
to
the
property
had
done
some
foolish
thing
for
which
he
could
not
forgive
himself
that
was
the
idea
with
which
his
mind
was
filled
he
waited
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
till
the
dial
showed
him
that
it
was
exactly
eight
and
then
with
a
sinking
heart
he
walked
slowly
out
of
the
along
the
passage
and
into
his
father
study
for
an
instant
he
stood
with
the
handle
in
his
hand
he
had
been
terribly
anxious
for
the
arrival
of
this
moment
but
now
that
it
had
come
he
would
almost
fain
have
had
it
again
postponed
his
heart
sank
very
low
as
he
turned
the
lock
and
entering
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
prendergast
prendergast
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
for
him
too
the
last
hour
had
been
full
of
bitterness
his
heart
also
had
sunk
low
within
him
his
blood
had
run
cold
within
his
veins
he
too
had
it
been
possible
would
have
put
off
this
wretched
hour
prendergast
it
may
be
was
not
much
given
to
poetry
but
the
feeling
if
not
the
words
were
there
within
him
the
work
which
a
friend
has
to
perform
for
a
friend
is
so
much
heavier
than
that
which
comes
in
the
way
of
any
profession
when
herbert
entered
the
room
prendergast
came
forward
from
where
he
was
standing
and
took
him
by
the
hand
this
is
a
very
sad
affair
he
said
very
sad
at
present
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
herbert
as
i
see
people
about
me
so
unhappy
i
suppose
it
is
sad
if
there
be
anything
that
i
hate
it
is
a
mystery
sit
down
fitzgerald
said
the
other
sit
down
and
prendergast
himself
sat
down
in
the
chair
that
was
ordinarily
occupied
by
sir
thomas
although
he
had
been
thinking
about
it
all
the
day
he
had
not
even
yet
made
up
his
mind
how
he
was
to
begin
his
story
even
now
he
could
not
help
thinking
whether
it
might
be
possible
for
him
to
leave
it
untold
but
it
was
not
possible
fitzgerald
said
he
you
must
prepare
yourself
for
tidings
which
are
very
grievous
indeed
very
grievous
whatever
it
is
i
must
bear
it
said
he
i
hope
you
have
that
moral
strength
which
enables
a
man
to
bear
misfortune
i
have
not
known
you
in
happy
days
and
therefore
perhaps
can
hardly
judge
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
do
possess
such
courage
did
i
not
think
so
i
could
hardly
go
through
the
task
that
is
before
me
here
he
paused
as
though
he
expected
some
reply
some
assurance
that
his
young
friend
did
possess
this
strength
of
which
he
spoke
but
herbert
said
nothing
nothing
out
loud
if
it
were
only
for
myself
if
it
were
only
for
myself
it
was
thus
that
he
spoke
to
his
own
heart
fitzgerald
continued
the
lawyer
i
do
not
know
how
far
you
may
be
acquainted
with
the
history
of
your
mother
first
marriage
herbert
said
that
he
was
hardly
acquainted
with
it
in
any
degree
and
explained
that
he
merely
knew
the
fact
that
his
mother
had
been
married
before
she
met
sir
thomas
i
do
not
know
that
i
need
recount
all
the
circumstances
to
you
now
though
doubtless
you
will
learn
them
your
mother
conduct
throughout
was
i
believe
admirable
i
am
quite
sure
of
that
no
amount
of
evidence
could
make
me
believe
the
contrary
and
there
is
no
tittle
of
evidence
to
make
any
one
think
so
but
in
her
early
youth
when
she
was
quite
a
child
she
was
given
in
marriage
to
a
man
to
a
man
of
whom
it
is
impossible
to
speak
in
terms
too
black
or
in
language
too
strong
and
now
this
day
but
here
he
paused
it
had
been
his
intention
to
say
that
that
very
man
the
first
husband
of
this
loved
mother
now
looked
upon
as
dead
for
so
many
years
this
miscreant
of
whom
he
had
spoken
that
this
man
had
been
in
that
room
that
very
day
but
he
hardly
knew
how
to
frame
the
words
well
said
herbert
well
and
he
spoke
in
a
hoarse
voice
that
was
scarcely
audible
prendergast
was
afraid
to
bring
out
the
very
pith
of
his
story
in
so
abrupt
a
manner
he
wished
to
have
the
work
over
to
feel
that
as
regarded
herbert
it
was
done
but
his
heart
failed
him
when
he
came
to
it
yes
he
said
going
back
as
it
were
to
his
former
thoughts
a
heartless
cruel
debauched
unscrupulous
man
one
in
whose
bosom
no
good
thing
seemed
to
have
been
implanted
your
father
when
he
first
knew
your
mother
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
this
man
was
dead
and
he
was
not
dead
prendergast
could
see
that
the
young
face
became
perfectly
pale
as
he
uttered
these
words
he
became
pale
and
clutched
hold
of
the
table
with
his
hand
and
there
sat
with
mouth
open
and
staring
eyes
i
am
afraid
not
said
prendergast
i
am
afraid
not
and
i
must
go
further
than
that
and
tell
you
that
he
is
still
living
prendergast
mr
prendergast
exclaimed
the
poor
fellow
rising
up
from
his
chair
and
shouting
out
as
though
for
mercy
prendergast
also
rose
from
his
seat
and
coming
up
to
him
took
him
by
the
arm
my
dear
boy
my
dear
boy
i
am
obliged
to
tell
you
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
know
it
the
fact
is
as
i
say
and
it
is
now
for
you
to
show
that
you
are
a
man
who
was
ever
called
upon
for
a
stronger
proof
of
manhood
than
this
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
it
is
not
for
oneself
that
one
has
to
be
brave
a
man
we
may
almost
say
is
no
man
whose
own
individual
sufferings
call
for
the
exercise
of
much
courage
but
we
are
all
so
mixed
up
and
conjoined
with
others
with
others
who
are
weaker
and
dearer
than
ourselves
that
great
sorrows
do
require
great
powers
of
endurance
by
degrees
as
he
stood
there
in
silence
the
whole
truth
made
its
way
into
his
mind
as
he
stood
there
with
his
arm
still
tenderly
pressed
by
that
old
man
no
one
now
would
have
called
the
lawyer
stern
in
looking
at
him
for
the
tears
were
coursing
down
his
cheeks
but
no
tears
came
to
the
relief
of
young
fitzgerald
as
the
truth
slowly
came
upon
him
fold
by
fold
black
cloud
upon
cloud
till
the
whole
horizon
of
his
life
prospect
was
dark
as
death
he
stood
there
silent
for
some
few
minutes
hardly
conscious
that
he
was
not
alone
as
he
saw
all
his
joys
disappearing
from
before
his
eye
one
by
one
his
family
pride
the
pleasant
duties
of
his
station
his
promised
seat
in
parliament
and
prosperous
ambition
the
full
respect
of
all
the
world
around
him
his
wealth
and
pride
of
place
for
let
no
man
be
credited
who
boasts
that
he
can
part
with
these
without
regret
all
these
were
gone
but
there
were
losses
more
bitter
than
these
how
could
he
think
of
his
affianced
bride
and
how
could
he
think
of
his
mother
no
tears
came
to
his
relief
while
the
truth
with
all
its
bearings
burnt
itself
into
his
very
soul
but
his
face
expressed
such
agony
that
it
was
terrible
to
be
seen
prendergast
could
stand
that
silence
no
longer
so
at
last
he
spoke
he
spoke
for
the
sake
of
words
for
all
his
tale
had
been
told
you
saw
the
man
that
was
here
yesterday
that
was
he
who
then
called
himself
talbot
what
the
man
that
went
away
in
the
car
mollett
yes
that
was
the
man
herbert
had
said
that
no
evidence
could
be
sufficient
to
make
him
believe
that
his
mother
had
been
in
any
way
culpable
and
such
probably
was
the
case
he
had
that
reliance
on
his
mother
that
assurance
in
his
mind
that
everything
coming
from
her
must
be
good
that
he
could
not
believe
her
capable
of
ill
but
nevertheless
he
could
not
prevent
himself
from
asking
within
his
own
breast
how
it
had
been
possible
that
his
mother
should
ever
have
been
concerned
with
such
a
wretch
as
that
it
was
a
question
which
could
not
fail
to
make
itself
audible
what
being
on
earth
was
sweeter
than
his
mother
more
excellent
more
noble
more
fitted
for
the
world
high
places
more
absolutely
entitled
to
that
universal
respect
which
seemed
to
be
given
to
her
as
her
own
by
right
and
what
being
could
be
more
loathsome
more
contemptible
than
he
who
was
as
he
was
now
told
his
mother
husband
there
was
in
it
a
want
of
verisimilitude
which
almost
gave
him
comfort
which
almost
taught
him
to
think
that
he
might
disbelieve
the
story
that
was
told
to
him
poor
fellow
he
had
yet
to
learn
the
difference
that
years
may
make
in
men
and
women
for
better
as
well
as
for
worse
circumstances
had
given
to
the
poor
village
girl
the
simple
dignity
of
high
station
as
circumstances
had
also
brought
to
the
lowest
dregs
of
human
existence
the
man
whose
personal
bearing
and
apparent
worldly
standing
had
been
held
sufficient
to
give
warrant
that
he
was
of
gentle
breeding
and
of
honest
standing
nay
her
good
fortune
in
such
a
marriage
had
once
been
almost
begrudged
her
by
all
her
maiden
neighbours
but
herbert
as
he
thought
of
this
was
almost
encouraged
to
disbelieve
the
story
to
him
with
his
knowledge
of
what
his
mother
was
and
such
knowledge
as
he
also
had
of
that
man
it
did
not
seem
possible
but
how
is
all
this
known
he
muttered
forth
at
last
i
fear
there
is
no
doubt
of
its
truth
said
prendergast
your
father
has
no
doubt
whatever
has
had
none
i
must
tell
you
this
plainly
for
some
months
for
some
months
and
why
have
i
not
been
told
do
not
be
hard
upon
your
father
hard
no
of
course
i
would
not
be
hard
upon
him
the
burden
he
has
had
to
bear
has
been
very
terrible
he
has
thought
that
by
payments
of
money
to
this
man
the
whole
thing
might
be
concealed
as
is
always
the
case
when
such
payments
are
made
the
insatiable
love
of
money
grew
by
what
it
fed
on
he
would
have
poured
out
every
shilling
into
that
man
hands
and
would
have
died
himself
a
beggar
have
died
speedily
too
under
such
torments
and
yet
no
good
would
have
been
done
the
harpy
would
have
come
upon
you
and
you
after
you
had
innocently
assumed
a
title
that
was
not
your
own
and
taken
a
property
to
which
you
have
no
right
you
then
would
have
had
to
own
that
which
your
father
must
own
now
if
it
be
so
said
herbert
slowly
it
must
be
acknowledged
just
so
fitzgerald
just
so
i
know
you
will
feel
that
in
such
matters
we
can
only
sail
safely
by
the
truth
there
is
no
other
compass
worth
a
man
while
to
look
at
of
course
not
said
herbert
with
hoarse
voice
one
does
not
wish
to
be
a
robber
and
a
thief
my
cousin
shall
have
what
is
his
own
and
then
he
involuntarily
thought
of
the
interview
they
had
had
on
that
very
day
but
why
did
he
not
tell
me
when
i
spoke
to
him
of
her
he
said
with
something
approaching
to
bitterness
in
his
voice
and
a
slight
struggle
in
his
throat
that
was
almost
premonitory
of
a
sob
ah
it
is
there
that
i
fear
for
you
i
know
what
your
feelings
are
but
think
of
his
sorrows
and
do
not
be
hard
on
him
ah
me
ah
me
exclaimed
herbert
i
fear
that
he
will
not
be
with
you
long
he
has
already
endured
till
he
is
now
almost
past
the
power
of
suffering
more
and
yet
there
is
so
much
more
that
he
must
suffer
my
poor
father
think
what
such
as
he
must
have
gone
through
in
bringing
himself
into
contact
with
that
man
and
all
this
has
been
done
that
he
might
spare
you
and
your
mother
think
of
the
wound
to
his
conscience
before
he
would
have
lowered
himself
to
an
unworthy
bargain
with
a
swindler
but
this
has
been
done
that
you
might
have
that
which
you
have
been
taught
to
look
on
as
your
own
he
has
been
wrong
no
other
verdict
can
be
given
but
you
at
any
rate
can
be
tender
to
such
a
fault
you
and
your
mother
i
will
i
will
said
herbert
but
if
it
had
happened
a
month
since
i
could
have
borne
it
and
then
he
thought
of
his
mother
and
hated
himself
for
what
he
had
said
how
could
he
have
borne
that
with
patience
and
there
is
no
doubt
you
say
i
think
none
the
man
carries
his
proofs
with
him
an
old
servant
here
in
the
house
too
knows
him
what
mrs
jones
yes
jones
and
the
burden
of
further
proof
must
now
of
course
be
thrown
on
us
not
on
him
directly
that
we
believe
the
statement
it
is
for
us
to
ascertain
its
truth
you
and
your
father
must
not
be
seen
to
hold
a
false
position
before
the
world
and
what
are
we
to
do
now
i
fear
that
your
mother
must
be
told
and
owen
fitzgerald
and
then
we
must
together
openly
prove
the
facts
either
in
one
way
or
in
the
other
it
will
be
better
that
we
should
do
this
together
that
is
you
and
your
cousin
owen
conjointly
do
it
openly
before
the
world
so
that
the
world
may
know
that
each
of
you
desires
only
what
is
honestly
his
own
for
myself
i
tell
you
fairly
that
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
truth
of
what
i
have
told
you
but
further
proof
is
certainly
needed
had
i
any
doubt
i
would
not
propose
to
tell
your
mother
as
it
is
i
think
it
will
be
wrong
to
keep
her
longer
in
the
dark
does
she
suspect
nothing
i
do
not
know
she
has
more
power
of
than
your
father
she
has
not
spoken
to
me
ten
words
since
i
have
been
in
the
house
and
in
not
doing
so
i
have
thought
that
she
was
right
my
own
mother
my
dear
mother
if
you
ask
me
my
opinion
i
think
that
she
does
suspect
the
truth
very
vaguely
with
an
indefinite
feeling
that
the
calamity
which
weighs
so
heavily
on
your
father
has
come
from
this
source
she
dear
lady
is
greatly
to
be
pitied
but
god
has
made
her
of
firmer
material
than
your
father
and
i
think
that
she
will
bear
her
sorrow
with
a
higher
courage
and
she
is
to
be
told
also
yes
i
think
so
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
avoid
it
if
we
do
not
tell
her
we
must
attempt
to
conceal
it
and
that
attempt
must
needs
be
futile
when
we
are
engaged
in
making
open
inquiry
on
the
subject
your
cousin
when
he
hears
of
this
will
of
course
be
anxious
to
know
what
his
real
prospects
are
yes
yes
he
will
be
anxious
and
determined
too
and
then
when
all
the
world
will
know
it
how
is
your
mother
to
be
kept
in
the
dark
and
that
which
she
fears
and
anticipates
is
as
bad
probably
as
the
actual
truth
if
my
advice
be
followed
nothing
will
be
kept
from
her
we
are
in
your
hands
i
suppose
mr
prendergast
i
can
only
act
as
my
judgment
directs
me
and
who
is
to
tell
her
this
he
asked
with
a
shudder
and
almost
in
a
whisper
the
very
idea
of
undertaking
such
a
duty
seemed
almost
too
much
for
him
and
yet
he
must
undertake
a
duty
almost
as
terrible
he
himself
no
one
but
him
must
endure
the
anguish
of
repeating
this
story
to
clara
desmond
and
to
the
countess
but
now
the
question
had
reference
to
his
own
mother
and
who
is
to
tell
her
he
asked
for
a
moment
or
two
prendergast
stood
silent
he
had
not
hitherto
in
so
many
words
undertaken
this
task
this
that
would
be
the
most
dreadful
of
all
but
if
he
did
not
undertake
it
who
would
i
suppose
that
i
must
do
it
at
last
he
said
very
gently
and
when
as
soon
as
i
have
told
your
cousin
i
will
go
down
to
him
after
breakfast
is
it
probable
that
i
shall
find
him
at
home
yes
if
you
are
there
before
ten
the
hounds
meet
at
cecilstown
within
three
miles
of
him
and
he
will
not
leave
home
till
near
eleven
but
it
is
possible
that
he
may
have
a
house
full
of
men
with
him
at
any
rate
i
will
try
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
he
may
surely
let
his
friends
go
to
the
hunt
without
him
and
then
between
nine
and
ten
this
interview
came
to
an
end
fitzgerald
said
prendergast
as
he
pressed
herbert
hand
you
have
borne
all
this
as
a
man
should
do
no
loss
of
fortune
can
ruin
one
who
is
so
well
able
to
endure
misfortune
but
in
this
prendergast
was
perhaps
mistaken
his
knowledge
of
human
nature
had
not
carried
him
sufficiently
far
a
man
courage
under
calamity
is
only
tested
when
he
is
left
in
solitude
the
meanest
among
us
can
bear
up
while
strange
eyes
are
looking
at
us
and
then
prendergast
went
away
and
he
was
alone
it
had
been
his
habit
during
the
whole
of
this
period
of
his
illness
to
go
to
sir
thomas
at
or
before
bedtime
these
visits
had
usually
been
made
to
the
study
the
room
in
which
he
was
now
standing
but
when
his
father
had
gone
to
his
bedroom
at
an
earlier
hour
herbert
had
always
seen
him
there
was
he
to
go
to
him
now
now
that
he
had
heard
all
this
and
if
so
how
was
he
to
bear
himself
there
in
his
father
presence
he
stood
still
thinking
of
this
till
the
hand
of
the
clock
showed
him
that
it
was
past
ten
and
then
it
struck
him
that
his
father
might
be
waiting
for
him
it
would
not
do
for
him
now
at
such
a
moment
to
appear
wanting
in
that
attention
which
he
had
always
shown
he
was
still
his
father
son
though
he
had
lost
the
right
to
bear
his
father
name
he
was
nameless
now
a
man
utterly
without
respect
or
in
the
world
a
being
whom
the
law
ignored
except
as
the
possessor
of
a
mere
life
such
was
he
now
instead
of
one
whose
rights
and
privileges
whose
property
and
rank
all
the
statutes
of
the
realm
and
customs
of
his
country
delighted
to
honour
and
protect
this
he
repeated
to
himself
over
and
over
again
it
was
to
such
a
pass
as
this
to
this
bitter
disappointment
that
his
father
had
brought
him
but
yet
it
should
not
be
said
of
him
that
he
had
begun
to
neglect
his
father
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
the
story
so
with
a
weary
step
he
walked
up
stairs
and
found
sir
thomas
in
bed
with
his
mother
sitting
by
the
bedside
his
mother
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
he
took
it
leaning
against
the
bedside
has
prendergast
left
you
she
asked
he
told
her
that
prendergast
had
left
him
and
gone
to
his
own
room
for
the
night
and
have
you
been
with
him
all
the
evening
she
asked
she
had
no
special
motive
in
so
asking
but
both
the
father
and
the
son
shuddered
at
the
question
yes
said
herbert
i
have
been
with
him
and
now
i
have
come
to
wish
my
father
good
night
and
you
too
mother
if
you
intend
to
remain
here
but
lady
fitzgerald
got
up
telling
herbert
that
she
would
leave
him
with
sir
thomas
and
before
either
of
them
could
hinder
her
from
departing
the
father
and
the
son
were
alone
together
sir
thomas
when
the
door
closed
looked
furtively
up
into
his
face
might
it
be
that
he
could
read
there
how
much
had
been
already
told
or
how
much
still
remained
to
be
disclosed
that
herbert
was
to
learn
it
all
that
evening
he
knew
but
it
might
be
that
prendergast
had
failed
to
perform
his
task
sir
thomas
in
his
heart
trusted
that
he
had
failed
he
looked
up
furtively
into
face
but
at
the
moment
there
was
nothing
there
that
he
could
read
there
was
nothing
there
but
black
misery
and
every
face
round
him
for
many
days
past
had
worn
that
aspect
for
a
minute
or
two
herbert
said
nothing
for
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
whether
or
no
he
would
that
night
disturb
his
father
rest
but
he
could
not
speak
in
his
ordinary
voice
or
bid
his
father
as
though
nothing
special
to
him
had
happened
father
said
he
after
a
short
pause
father
i
know
it
all
now
my
boy
my
poor
boy
my
unfortunate
boy
father
said
herbert
do
not
be
unhappy
about
me
i
can
bear
it
and
then
he
thought
again
of
his
bride
his
bride
as
she
was
to
have
been
but
nevertheless
he
repeated
his
last
words
i
can
bear
it
father
i
have
meant
it
for
the
best
herbert
said
the
poor
man
pleading
to
his
child
i
know
that
all
of
us
well
know
that
but
what
prendergast
says
is
true
it
is
better
that
it
should
be
known
that
man
would
have
killed
you
had
you
kept
it
longer
to
yourself
sir
thomas
hid
his
face
upon
the
pillow
as
the
remembrance
of
what
he
had
endured
in
those
meetings
came
upon
him
the
blow
that
had
told
heaviest
was
that
visit
from
the
son
and
the
threats
which
the
man
had
made
still
rung
in
his
ears
when
that
youngster
was
born
lady
was
was
she
my
governor
could
take
her
away
according
to
the
law
of
the
land
could
he
now
these
words
and
more
such
as
these
had
nearly
killed
him
at
the
time
and
now
as
they
recurred
to
him
he
burst
out
into
childish
tears
poor
man
the
days
of
his
manhood
had
gone
and
nothing
but
the
tears
of
a
second
bitter
childhood
remained
to
him
the
hot
iron
had
entered
into
his
soul
and
shrivelled
up
the
very
muscles
of
his
strength
herbert
without
much
thought
of
what
he
was
doing
knelt
down
by
the
bedside
and
put
his
hand
upon
that
of
his
father
which
lay
out
upon
the
sheet
there
he
knelt
for
one
or
two
minutes
watching
and
listening
to
his
father
sobs
you
will
be
better
now
father
he
said
for
the
great
weight
of
this
terrible
secret
will
be
off
your
mind
but
sir
thomas
did
not
answer
him
with
him
there
could
never
be
any
better
all
things
belonging
to
him
had
gone
to
ruin
all
those
around
him
whom
he
had
loved
and
he
had
loved
those
around
him
very
dearly
were
brought
to
poverty
and
sorrow
and
disgrace
the
power
of
feeling
this
was
left
to
him
but
the
power
of
enduring
this
with
manhood
was
gone
the
blow
had
come
upon
him
too
late
in
life
and
herbert
himself
as
he
knelt
there
could
hardly
forbear
from
tears
now
at
such
a
moment
as
this
he
could
think
of
no
one
but
his
father
the
author
of
his
being
who
lay
there
so
grievously
afflicted
by
sorrows
which
were
in
nowise
selfish
father
he
said
at
last
will
you
pray
with
me
and
then
when
the
poor
sufferer
had
turned
his
face
towards
him
he
poured
forth
his
prayer
to
his
saviour
that
they
all
in
that
family
might
be
enabled
to
bear
the
heavy
sorrows
which
god
in
his
mercy
and
wisdom
had
now
thought
fit
to
lay
upon
them
i
will
not
make
his
words
profane
by
repeating
them
here
but
one
may
say
confidently
that
they
were
not
uttered
in
vain
and
now
dearest
father
good
night
he
said
as
he
rose
from
his
knees
and
stretching
over
the
bed
he
kissed
his
father
forehead
chapter
xxiii
before
breakfast
at
hap
house
it
may
be
imagined
that
mollett
drive
back
to
cork
after
his
last
visit
to
castle
richmond
had
not
been
very
pleasant
and
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
his
present
circumstances
altogether
were
as
unpleasant
as
his
worst
enemies
could
desire
i
have
endeavoured
to
excite
the
sympathy
of
those
who
are
going
with
me
through
this
story
for
the
sufferings
of
that
family
of
the
fitzgeralds
but
how
shall
i
succeed
in
exciting
their
sympathy
for
this
other
family
of
the
molletts
and
yet
why
not
if
we
are
to
sympathise
only
with
the
good
or
worse
still
only
with
the
graceful
how
little
will
there
be
in
our
character
that
is
better
than
terrestrial
those
molletts
also
were
human
and
had
strings
to
their
hearts
at
which
the
world
would
now
probably
pull
with
sufficient
vigour
for
myself
i
can
truly
say
that
my
strongest
feeling
is
for
their
wretchedness
the
father
and
son
had
more
than
once
boasted
among
themselves
that
the
game
they
were
now
playing
was
a
high
one
that
they
were
in
fact
gambling
for
mighty
stakes
and
in
truth
as
long
as
the
money
came
in
to
them
flowing
in
as
the
result
of
their
own
craft
in
this
game
the
excitement
had
about
it
something
that
was
very
pleasurable
there
was
danger
which
makes
all
games
pleasant
there
was
money
in
handfuls
for
daily
expenses
those
daily
wants
of
the
appetite
which
are
to
such
men
more
important
by
far
than
the
distant
necessities
of
life
there
was
a
possibility
of
future
grandeur
an
opening
out
of
magnificent
ideas
of
fortune
which
charmed
them
greatly
as
they
thought
about
it
what
might
they
not
do
with
forty
thousand
pounds
divided
between
them
or
even
with
a
thousand
a
year
each
settled
on
them
for
life
and
surely
their
secret
was
worth
that
money
nay
was
it
not
palpable
to
the
meanest
calculation
that
it
was
worth
much
more
had
they
not
the
selling
of
twelve
thousand
a
year
for
ever
and
ever
to
this
family
of
fitzgerald
but
for
the
last
fortnight
things
had
begun
to
go
astray
with
them
money
easily
come
by
goes
easily
and
money
badly
come
by
goes
badly
theirs
had
come
easily
and
badly
and
had
so
gone
what
necessity
could
there
be
for
economy
with
such
a
as
that
close
to
their
elbows
so
both
of
them
had
thought
if
not
argued
and
there
had
been
no
economy
no
economy
in
the
use
of
that
very
costly
amusement
the
and
now
at
the
present
moment
ready
money
having
failed
to
be
the
result
of
either
of
the
two
last
visits
to
castle
richmond
the
family
funds
were
running
low
it
may
be
said
that
ready
money
for
the
moment
was
the
one
desire
nearest
to
the
heart
of
mollett
p√®re
when
he
took
that
last
journey
over
the
boggeragh
mountains
ready
money
wherewith
to
satisfy
the
pressing
claims
of
miss
and
bring
back
civility
or
rather
servility
to
the
face
and
manner
of
tom
the
waiter
at
the
kanturk
hotel
very
little
of
that
servility
can
be
enjoyed
by
persons
of
the
mollett
class
when
money
ceases
to
be
ready
in
their
hands
and
pockets
and
there
is
perhaps
nothing
that
they
enjoy
so
keenly
as
servility
mollett
p√®re
had
gone
down
determined
that
that
comfort
should
at
any
rate
be
forthcoming
to
him
whatever
answer
might
be
given
to
those
other
grander
demands
and
we
know
what
success
had
attended
his
mission
he
had
looked
to
find
his
tame
trembling
in
her
accustomed
stall
and
he
had
found
a
resolute
bull
there
in
her
place
a
bull
whom
he
could
by
no
means
take
by
the
horns
he
had
got
no
money
and
before
he
had
reached
cork
he
had
begun
to
comprehend
that
it
was
not
probable
that
he
should
get
more
from
that
source
during
a
part
of
the
interview
between
him
and
prendergast
some
spark
of
mercy
towards
his
victims
had
glimmered
into
his
heart
when
it
was
explained
to
him
that
the
game
was
to
be
given
up
that
the
family
at
castle
richmond
was
prepared
to
acknowledge
the
truth
and
that
the
effort
made
was
with
the
view
of
proving
that
the
poor
lady
up
stairs
was
not
entitled
to
the
name
she
bore
rather
than
that
she
was
so
entitled
then
some
slight
promptings
of
a
better
spirit
did
for
a
while
tempt
him
to
be
merciful
oh
what
are
you
about
to
do
he
would
have
said
had
prendergast
admitted
of
speech
from
him
why
make
this
terrible
sacrifice
matters
have
not
come
to
that
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
drag
to
the
light
this
terrible
fact
i
will
not
divulge
it
no
not
although
you
are
hard
upon
me
in
regard
to
these
terms
of
mine
i
will
still
keep
it
to
myself
and
trust
to
you
to
you
who
are
all
so
rich
and
able
to
pay
for
what
consideration
you
may
please
to
give
me
this
was
the
state
of
his
mind
when
jones
evidence
was
being
slowly
evoked
from
her
but
it
had
undergone
a
considerable
change
before
he
reached
cork
by
that
time
he
had
taught
himself
to
understand
that
there
was
no
longer
a
chance
to
him
of
any
consideration
whatever
slowly
he
had
brought
it
home
to
himself
that
these
people
had
resolutely
determined
to
blow
up
the
ground
on
which
they
themselves
stood
this
he
perceived
was
their
honesty
he
did
not
understand
the
nature
of
a
feeling
which
could
induce
so
fatal
a
suicide
but
he
did
understand
that
the
feeling
was
there
and
that
the
suicide
would
be
completed
and
now
what
was
he
to
do
next
in
the
way
of
earning
his
bread
various
thoughts
ran
through
his
brain
and
different
resolves
but
still
perhaps
capable
of
shape
presented
themselves
to
him
for
the
future
it
was
still
on
the
cards
on
the
cards
but
barely
so
that
he
might
make
money
out
of
these
people
but
he
must
wait
perhaps
for
weeks
before
he
again
commenced
such
an
attempt
he
might
perhaps
make
money
out
of
them
and
be
merciful
to
them
at
the
same
time
not
money
by
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
that
golden
dream
was
gone
for
ever
but
still
money
that
might
be
comfortably
luxurious
as
long
as
it
could
be
made
to
last
but
then
on
one
special
point
he
made
a
firm
and
final
resolution
whatever
new
scheme
he
might
hatch
he
alone
would
manage
never
again
would
he
call
into
his
councils
that
son
of
his
loins
whose
rapacious
greed
had
as
he
felt
sure
brought
upon
him
all
this
ruin
had
aby
not
gone
to
castle
richmond
with
his
cruelty
and
his
greed
frightening
to
the
very
death
the
soul
of
that
poor
baronet
by
the
enormity
of
his
demands
prendergast
would
not
have
been
there
of
what
further
chance
of
castle
richmond
pickings
there
might
be
aby
should
know
nothing
he
and
his
son
would
no
longer
hunt
in
couples
he
would
shake
him
off
in
that
escape
which
they
must
both
now
make
from
cork
and
he
would
not
care
how
long
it
might
be
before
he
again
saw
his
countenance
but
then
that
question
of
ready
money
and
that
other
question
perhaps
as
interesting
touching
a
criminal
prosecution
how
was
he
to
escape
if
he
could
not
raise
the
wind
and
how
could
he
raise
the
wind
now
that
his
had
run
so
dry
he
had
promised
the
money
that
evening
and
had
struggled
hard
to
make
that
promise
with
an
easy
face
he
now
had
none
to
give
them
his
orders
at
the
inn
were
treated
almost
with
contempt
for
the
last
three
days
they
had
given
him
what
he
wanted
to
eat
and
drink
but
would
hardly
give
him
all
that
he
wanted
when
he
called
for
brandy
they
brought
him
whisky
and
it
had
only
been
by
hard
begging
and
by
oaths
as
to
the
promised
money
that
he
had
induced
them
to
supply
him
with
the
car
which
had
taken
him
on
his
fruitless
journey
to
castle
richmond
as
he
was
driven
up
to
the
door
in
south
main
street
his
heart
was
very
sad
on
all
these
subjects
aby
was
again
sitting
within
the
bar
but
was
no
longer
basking
in
the
sunshine
of
fanny
smiles
he
was
sitting
there
because
fanny
had
not
yet
mustered
courage
to
turn
him
out
he
was
for
it
had
been
found
impossible
to
keep
spirits
from
him
and
there
had
been
hot
words
between
him
and
fanny
in
which
she
had
twitted
him
with
his
unpaid
bill
and
he
had
twitted
her
with
her
former
love
and
things
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse
and
she
had
all
but
called
in
tom
for
aid
in
getting
quit
of
him
she
had
however
refrained
thinking
of
the
money
that
might
be
coming
and
waiting
also
till
her
father
should
arrive
fanny
love
for
abraham
mollett
had
not
been
long
lived
i
will
not
describe
another
scene
such
as
those
which
had
of
late
been
frequent
in
the
kanturk
hotel
the
father
and
the
son
soon
found
themselves
together
in
the
small
room
in
which
they
now
both
slept
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
aby
tipsy
as
he
was
understood
the
whole
of
what
had
happened
at
castle
richmond
when
he
heard
that
prendergast
was
seen
in
that
room
in
lieu
of
sir
thomas
he
knew
at
once
that
the
game
had
been
abandoned
but
something
may
yet
be
done
at
aby
said
to
himself
only
one
must
be
deuced
quick
the
father
and
the
son
of
course
quarrelled
frightfully
like
dogs
over
the
memory
of
a
bone
which
had
been
arrested
from
the
jaws
of
both
of
them
aby
said
that
his
father
had
lost
everything
by
his
pusillanimity
and
old
mollett
declared
that
his
son
had
destroyed
all
by
his
rashness
but
we
need
not
repeat
their
quarrels
nor
repeat
all
that
passed
between
them
and
tom
before
food
was
forthcoming
to
satisfy
the
old
man
wants
as
he
ate
he
calculated
how
much
he
might
probably
raise
upon
his
watch
towards
taking
him
to
london
and
how
best
he
might
get
off
from
cork
without
leaving
any
scent
in
the
nostrils
of
his
son
his
clothes
he
must
leave
behind
him
at
the
inn
at
least
all
that
he
could
not
pack
upon
his
person
lately
he
had
made
himself
comfortable
in
this
respect
and
he
sorrowed
over
the
fine
linen
which
he
had
worn
but
once
or
twice
since
it
had
been
bought
with
the
last
instalment
from
sir
thomas
nevertheless
in
this
way
he
did
make
up
his
mind
for
the
campaign
and
aby
also
made
up
his
mind
something
at
any
rate
he
had
learned
from
fanny
in
return
for
his
honeyed
words
when
herbert
fitzgerald
should
cease
to
be
the
heir
to
castle
richmond
owen
fitzgerald
of
hap
house
would
be
the
happy
man
that
knowledge
was
his
own
in
absolute
independence
of
his
father
and
there
might
still
be
time
for
him
to
use
it
he
knew
well
the
locality
of
hap
house
and
he
would
be
there
early
on
the
following
morning
these
tidings
had
probably
not
as
yet
reached
the
owner
of
that
blessed
abode
and
if
he
could
be
the
first
to
tell
him
the
game
there
too
might
be
pretty
enough
if
it
were
played
well
by
such
a
as
his
own
yes
he
would
be
at
hap
house
early
in
the
morning
but
then
how
to
get
there
he
left
his
father
preparing
for
bed
and
going
down
into
the
bar
found
and
his
daughter
there
in
close
consultation
they
were
endeavouring
to
arrive
by
their
joint
wisdom
at
some
conclusion
as
to
what
they
should
do
with
their
two
guests
fanny
was
for
turning
them
out
at
once
the
first
loss
is
the
least
said
she
and
they
is
so
disrispectable
i
niver
know
what
afther
and
always
is
expecting
the
will
be
down
on
them
but
the
father
shook
his
head
he
had
done
nothing
wrong
the
police
could
not
hurt
him
and
thirty
pounds
as
he
told
his
daughter
with
much
emphasis
was
a
deuced
sight
of
money
the
first
loss
is
the
least
said
fanny
perseveringly
and
then
aby
entered
to
them
my
father
has
made
a
mull
of
this
matter
again
said
he
going
at
once
into
the
middle
of
the
subject
come
back
without
a
shiner
i
be
bound
he
has
said
sarcastically
and
that
when
only
got
to
go
two
or
three
miles
further
and
hall
his
troubles
would
have
been
over
troubles
over
would
they
said
fanny
i
wish
he
have
the
goodness
to
get
over
his
little
troubles
in
this
house
by
paying
us
our
bill
you
have
to
walk
if
it
not
done
and
that
mollett
and
so
i
tell
you
and
take
nothing
with
you
i
can
tell
you
father
have
the
police
to
see
to
that
do
you
be
so
cruel
now
miss
fanny
said
aby
with
a
leering
look
i
tell
you
what
it
is
i
must
go
down
again
to
them
diggings
very
early
starting
say
at
four
you
not
have
a
foot
out
of
my
stables
said
all
look
here
there
been
a
sight
of
money
due
to
us
from
those
fitzgerald
people
down
there
you
know
and
whether
hable
to
pay
or
not
i
wo
deny
but
what
father
the
best
of
it
the
best
of
it
and
sent
it
trolling
bad
luck
to
him
but
there
no
good
looking
hafter
spilt
milk
is
there
if
so
be
that
sir
thomas
owed
the
likes
of
you
money
he
would
have
paid
it
without
your
tramping
down
there
time
after
time
to
look
for
it
he
not
one
of
that
sort
no
indeed
said
fanny
and
i
do
believe
anything
about
your
seeing
sir
thomas
oh
we
seed
him
hoften
enough
there
no
mistake
about
that
but
now
and
then
with
a
mysterious
air
and
low
voice
he
explained
to
them
that
this
considerable
balance
of
money
still
due
to
them
was
to
be
paid
by
the
cousin
owen
of
appy
and
to
substantiate
all
his
story
he
exhibited
a
letter
from
prendergast
to
his
father
which
some
months
since
had
intimated
that
a
sum
of
money
would
be
paid
on
behalf
of
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
if
mollett
would
call
at
prendergast
office
at
a
certain
hour
the
ultimate
effect
of
all
this
was
that
the
car
was
granted
for
the
morning
with
certain
dire
threats
as
to
any
further
breach
of
engagement
very
early
on
the
following
morning
aby
was
astir
hoping
that
he
might
manage
to
complete
his
not
elaborate
toilet
without
disturbing
his
father
slumbers
for
it
must
be
known
he
had
been
very
urgent
with
the
as
to
the
necessity
of
keeping
this
journey
of
his
a
secret
from
his
governor
but
the
governor
was
wide
awake
looking
at
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
closed
eye
whenever
his
back
was
turned
and
not
caring
much
what
he
was
about
to
do
with
himself
mollett
p√®re
wished
to
be
left
alone
for
that
morning
that
he
also
might
play
his
little
game
in
his
own
solitary
fashion
and
was
not
at
all
disposed
to
question
the
movements
of
his
son
at
about
five
aby
started
for
hap
house
his
toilet
i
have
said
was
not
elaborate
but
in
this
i
have
perhaps
wronged
him
up
there
in
the
he
did
not
waste
much
time
over
his
soap
and
water
but
he
was
aware
that
first
impressions
are
everything
and
that
one
young
man
should
appear
smart
and
clever
before
another
if
he
wished
to
carry
any
effect
with
him
so
he
took
his
brush
and
comb
in
his
pocket
and
a
pot
of
grease
with
which
he
was
wont
to
polish
his
long
and
he
hurriedly
grasped
up
his
pins
and
his
rings
and
the
satin
stock
which
fanny
in
her
kinder
mood
had
folded
for
him
and
then
during
his
long
journey
to
hap
house
he
did
perform
a
toilet
which
may
perhaps
be
fairly
called
elaborate
there
was
a
long
tortuous
narrow
avenue
going
from
the
mallow
and
kanturk
road
down
to
hap
house
which
impressed
aby
with
the
idea
that
the
man
on
whom
he
was
now
about
to
call
was
also
a
big
gentleman
and
made
him
more
uneasy
than
he
would
have
been
had
he
entered
a
place
with
less
pretence
there
is
a
story
current
that
in
the
west
of
england
the
grandeur
of
maiden
ladies
is
measured
by
the
length
of
the
tail
of
their
cats
and
aby
had
a
perhaps
equally
correct
idea
that
the
length
of
the
private
drive
up
to
a
gentleman
house
was
a
fair
criterion
of
the
splendour
of
his
position
if
this
man
had
about
him
as
much
grandeur
as
sir
thomas
himself
would
he
be
so
anxious
as
aby
had
hoped
to
obtain
the
additional
grandeur
of
sir
thomas
it
was
in
that
direction
that
his
mind
was
operating
when
he
got
down
from
the
car
and
rang
at
the
owen
as
everybody
called
him
was
at
home
but
not
down
and
so
aby
was
shown
into
the
it
was
now
considerably
past
nine
and
the
servant
told
him
that
his
master
must
be
there
soon
as
he
had
to
eat
his
breakfast
and
be
at
the
hunt
by
eleven
the
servant
at
hap
house
was
more
unsophisticated
than
those
at
castle
richmond
and
aby
personal
adornments
had
had
their
effect
he
found
himself
sitting
in
the
room
with
the
cups
and
saucers
aye
and
with
the
silver
and
began
again
to
trust
that
his
mission
might
be
successful
and
then
the
door
opened
and
a
man
appeared
clad
from
top
to
toe
in
hunting
costume
this
was
not
owen
fitzgerald
but
his
friend
captain
donnellan
as
it
had
happened
captain
donnellan
was
the
only
guest
who
had
graced
the
festivities
of
hap
house
on
the
previous
evening
and
now
he
appeared
at
the
breakfast
table
before
his
host
aby
got
up
from
his
chair
when
the
gentleman
entered
and
was
proceeding
to
business
but
the
captain
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
master
of
the
house
was
not
yet
in
presence
and
so
aby
sat
down
again
what
was
he
to
do
when
the
master
did
arrive
his
story
was
not
one
which
would
well
bear
telling
before
a
third
person
and
then
while
captain
donnellan
was
scanning
this
visitor
to
his
friend
owen
and
bethinking
himself
whether
he
might
not
be
a
sheriff
officer
and
whether
if
so
some
notice
ought
not
to
be
conveyed
up
stairs
to
the
master
of
the
house
another
car
was
driven
up
to
the
front
door
in
this
case
the
arrival
was
from
castle
richmond
and
the
two
servants
knew
each
other
well
thady
said
richard
with
much
authority
in
his
voice
this
is
prendergast
from
our
place
and
he
must
see
the
masther
before
he
goes
to
the
hunt
faix
and
the
masther
have
something
to
do
this
blessed
morning
said
thady
as
he
showed
prendergast
also
into
the
and
went
up
stairs
to
inform
his
master
that
there
was
yet
another
gentleman
come
upon
business
the
captain
has
got
both
to
hisself
said
thady
as
he
closed
the
door
the
name
of
pendhrergrast
as
the
irish
servants
generally
called
him
was
quite
unknown
to
the
owner
of
hap
house
as
was
also
that
of
mollett
which
had
been
brought
up
to
him
the
first
of
the
two
but
owen
began
to
think
that
there
must
be
something
very
unusual
in
a
day
so
singularly
ushered
in
to
him
callers
at
hap
house
on
business
were
very
few
unless
when
tradesmen
in
want
of
money
occasionally
dropped
in
upon
him
but
now
that
he
was
so
summoned
owen
began
to
bestir
himself
with
his
boots
and
breeches
a
gentleman
costume
for
a
hunting
morning
is
always
a
slow
one
sometimes
so
slow
and
tedious
as
to
make
him
think
of
forswearing
such
articles
of
dress
for
all
future
ages
but
now
he
did
bestir
himself
in
a
moody
melancholy
sort
of
manner
for
his
manner
in
all
things
latterly
had
become
moody
and
melancholy
in
the
mean
time
captain
donnellan
and
the
two
strangers
sat
almost
in
silence
in
the
the
captain
though
he
did
not
perhaps
know
much
of
things
noticeable
in
this
world
did
know
something
of
a
gentleman
and
was
therefore
not
led
away
as
poor
thady
had
been
by
aby
hat
and
rings
he
had
stared
aby
full
in
the
face
when
he
entered
the
room
and
having
explained
that
he
was
not
the
master
of
the
house
had
not
vouchsafed
another
word
but
then
he
had
also
seen
that
prendergast
was
of
a
different
class
and
had
said
a
civil
word
or
two
asking
him
to
come
near
the
fire
and
suggesting
that
owen
would
be
down
in
less
than
five
minutes
but
the
old
cock
would
crow
as
he
afterwards
remarked
to
his
friend
and
so
they
all
three
sat
in
silence
the
captain
being
very
busy
about
his
knees
as
hunting
gentlemen
sometimes
are
when
they
come
down
to
bachelor
breakfasts
and
then
at
last
owen
fitzgerald
entered
the
room
he
has
been
described
as
a
handsome
man
but
in
no
dress
did
he
look
so
well
as
when
equipped
for
a
day
sport
and
what
dress
that
englishmen
ever
wear
is
so
handsome
as
this
or
we
may
perhaps
say
what
other
dress
does
english
custom
allow
them
that
is
in
any
respect
not
the
reverse
of
handsome
we
have
come
to
be
so
dingy
in
our
taste
i
was
going
to
say
but
it
is
rather
in
our
want
of
taste
so
careless
of
any
of
the
laws
of
beauty
in
the
folds
and
lines
and
hues
of
our
dress
so
opposed
to
grace
in
the
arrangement
of
our
persons
that
it
is
not
permitted
to
the
ordinary
english
gentleman
to
be
anything
else
but
ugly
hats
coats
and
pantaloons
that
fit
nothing
came
creeping
in
upon
us
one
after
the
other
while
the
georges
reigned
creeping
in
upon
us
with
such
pictures
as
we
painted
under
the
reign
of
west
and
such
houses
as
we
built
under
the
reign
of
nash
till
the
english
eye
required
to
rest
on
that
which
was
constrained
dull
and
graceless
for
the
last
two
score
of
years
it
has
come
to
this
that
if
a
man
go
in
handsome
attire
he
is
a
popinjay
and
a
vain
fool
and
as
it
is
better
to
be
ugly
than
to
be
accounted
vain
i
would
not
counsel
a
young
friend
to
leave
the
beaten
track
on
the
strength
of
his
own
judgment
but
not
the
less
is
the
beaten
track
to
be
condemned
and
abandoned
and
abolished
if
such
be
in
any
way
possible
beauty
is
good
in
all
things
and
i
can
not
but
think
that
those
old
venetian
senators
and
florentine
men
of
council
owed
somewhat
of
their
country
pride
and
power
to
the
manner
in
which
they
clipped
their
beards
and
wore
their
flowing
garments
but
an
englishman
may
still
make
himself
brave
when
he
goes
forth
into
the
hunting
field
custom
there
allows
him
colour
and
garments
that
fit
his
limbs
strength
is
the
outward
characteristic
of
manhood
and
at
the
he
may
appear
strong
look
at
men
as
they
walk
along
and
ask
yourself
whether
any
outward
sign
of
manhood
or
strength
can
be
seen
there
and
of
gentle
manhood
outward
dignity
should
be
the
trade
mark
i
will
not
say
that
such
outward
dignity
is
incompatible
with
a
black
hat
and
plaid
trousers
for
the
eye
instructed
by
habit
will
search
out
dignity
for
itself
wherever
it
may
truly
exist
let
it
be
hidden
by
what
vile
covering
it
may
but
any
man
who
can
look
well
at
his
club
will
look
better
as
he
clusters
round
the
hounds
while
many
a
one
who
is
comely
there
is
mean
enough
as
he
stands
on
the
before
his
club
fire
in
my
mind
men
like
churches
and
books
and
women
too
should
be
brave
not
mean
in
their
outward
garniture
and
owen
as
i
have
said
was
brave
as
he
walked
into
his
the
sorrow
which
weighed
on
his
heart
had
not
wrinkled
his
brow
but
had
given
him
a
set
dignity
of
purpose
his
tall
figure
which
his
present
dress
allowed
to
be
seen
was
perfect
in
its
symmetry
of
strength
his
bright
chestnut
hair
clustered
round
his
forehead
and
his
eye
shone
like
that
of
a
hawk
they
must
have
been
wrong
who
said
that
he
commonly
spent
his
nights
over
the
that
pleasure
always
leaves
its
disgusting
traces
round
the
lips
and
owen
fitzgerald
lips
were
as
full
and
lusty
as
apollo
mollett
as
he
saw
him
was
stricken
with
envy
if
i
could
only
get
enough
money
out
of
this
affair
to
look
like
that
was
his
first
thought
as
his
eye
fell
on
the
future
heir
not
understanding
poor
wretch
that
he
was
that
all
the
gold
of
california
could
not
bring
him
one
inch
nearer
to
the
goal
he
aimed
at
i
think
i
have
said
before
that
your
silk
purse
will
not
get
itself
made
out
of
that
coarse
material
with
which
there
are
so
many
attempts
to
manufacture
that
article
and
prendergast
rose
from
his
chair
when
he
saw
him
with
a
respect
that
was
almost
involuntary
he
had
not
heard
men
speak
well
of
owen
fitzgerald
not
that
things
had
been
said
by
the
family
at
castle
richmond
but
circumstances
had
prevented
the
possibility
of
their
praising
him
if
a
relative
or
friend
be
spoken
of
without
praise
he
is
in
fact
censured
from
what
he
had
heard
he
had
certainly
not
expected
a
man
who
would
look
so
noble
as
did
the
owner
of
hap
house
who
now
came
forward
to
ask
him
his
business
both
prendergast
and
aby
mollett
rose
at
the
same
time
since
the
arrival
of
the
latter
gentleman
aby
had
been
wondering
who
he
might
be
but
no
idea
that
he
was
that
lawyer
from
castle
richmond
had
entered
his
head
that
he
was
a
stranger
like
himself
aby
saw
but
he
did
not
connect
him
with
his
own
business
indeed
he
had
not
yet
realized
the
belief
though
his
father
had
done
so
that
the
truth
would
be
revealed
by
those
at
castle
richmond
to
him
at
hap
house
his
object
now
was
that
the
old
gentleman
should
say
his
say
and
begone
leaving
him
to
dispose
of
the
other
young
man
in
the
as
best
he
might
but
then
as
it
happened
that
was
also
prendergast
line
of
action
gentlemen
said
owen
i
beg
your
pardon
for
keeping
you
waiting
but
the
fact
is
that
i
am
so
seldom
honoured
in
this
way
in
a
morning
that
i
was
hardly
ready
donnellan
there
the
tea
mind
waiting
these
gentlemen
will
perhaps
join
us
and
then
he
looked
hard
at
aby
as
though
he
trusted
in
providence
that
no
such
profanation
would
be
done
to
his
thank
you
i
have
breakfasted
said
prendergast
and
so
i
said
aby
who
had
eaten
a
penny
loaf
in
the
car
and
would
have
been
delighted
to
sit
down
at
that
rich
table
but
he
was
a
little
beside
himself
and
not
able
to
pluck
up
courage
for
such
an
effort
i
do
know
whether
you
two
gentlemen
have
come
about
the
same
business
said
owen
looking
from
one
to
the
other
no
said
prendergast
very
confidently
but
not
very
correctly
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
fitzgerald
for
a
few
minutes
but
my
business
with
you
is
quite
private
so
is
mine
said
aby
very
private
very
private
indeed
well
gentlemen
i
have
just
half
an
hour
in
which
to
eat
my
breakfast
attend
to
business
get
on
my
horse
and
leave
the
house
out
of
that
minutes
are
very
much
at
your
service
donnellan
i
beg
your
pardon
do
pitch
into
the
broiled
bones
while
they
are
hot
never
mind
me
and
now
gentlemen
if
you
will
walk
with
me
into
the
other
room
first
come
first
served
that
i
suppose
should
be
the
order
and
he
opened
the
door
and
stood
with
it
ajar
in
his
hand
i
will
wait
fitzgerald
if
you
please
said
prendergast
and
as
he
spoke
he
motioned
mollett
with
his
hand
to
go
to
the
door
oh
i
can
wait
sir
i
rather
wait
sir
i
would
indeed
said
aby
my
business
is
a
little
particular
and
if
you
go
on
sir
i
take
up
with
the
as
soon
as
you
done
sir
but
prendergast
was
accustomed
to
have
his
own
way
i
should
prefer
that
you
should
go
first
sir
and
to
tell
the
truth
fitzgerald
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
will
take
some
time
it
is
of
much
importance
to
yourself
and
to
others
and
i
fear
that
you
will
probably
find
that
it
will
detain
you
from
your
amusement
owen
looked
black
as
he
heard
this
the
hounds
were
going
to
draw
a
covert
of
his
own
and
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
remaining
away
from
the
drawing
of
any
coverts
belonging
to
himself
or
others
on
any
provocation
whatever
that
will
be
rather
hard
said
he
considering
that
i
do
not
know
any
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
what
you
come
about
you
shall
be
the
sole
judge
yourself
sir
of
the
importance
of
my
business
with
you
said
prendergast
well
i
forget
your
name
said
owen
my
name
mollett
said
aby
whereupon
prendergast
looked
up
at
him
very
sharply
but
he
said
he
said
nothing
but
he
looked
very
sharply
indeed
he
now
knew
well
who
this
man
was
and
guessed
with
tolerable
accuracy
the
cause
of
his
visit
but
nevertheless
at
the
moment
he
said
nothing
come
along
then
mollett
i
hope
your
affair
is
not
likely
to
be
a
very
long
one
also
perhaps
you
excuse
my
having
a
cup
of
tea
sent
in
to
me
as
you
talk
to
me
there
is
nothing
like
saving
time
when
such
very
important
business
is
on
the
tapis
donnellan
send
thady
in
with
a
cup
of
tea
like
a
good
fellow
now
mr
mollett
mollett
rose
slowly
from
his
chair
and
followed
his
host
he
would
have
given
all
he
possessed
in
the
world
and
that
was
very
little
to
have
had
the
coast
clear
but
in
such
an
emergency
what
was
he
to
do
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
door
of
the
he
had
all
but
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
fitzgerald
that
seeing
there
was
so
much
other
business
on
hand
this
morning
at
hap
house
this
special
piece
of
business
of
his
must
stand
over
but
then
how
could
he
go
back
to
cork
so
he
followed
owen
into
the
room
and
there
opened
his
budget
with
what
courage
he
had
left
to
him
captain
donnellan
as
he
employed
himself
on
the
broiled
bones
twice
invited
prendergast
to
assist
him
but
in
vain
donnellan
remained
there
waiting
for
owen
till
eleven
and
then
got
on
his
horse
you
tell
fitzgerald
will
you
that
i
started
see
nothing
of
hunt
that
clear
i
do
think
he
will
said
prendergast
chapter
xxiv
after
breakfast
at
hap
house
i
do
think
he
will
said
prendergast
and
as
he
spoke
captain
donnellan
ear
could
detect
that
there
was
something
approaching
to
sarcasm
in
the
tone
of
the
old
man
voice
the
captain
was
quite
sure
that
his
friend
would
not
be
even
at
the
heel
of
the
hunt
that
day
and
without
further
compunction
proceeded
to
fasten
his
buckskin
gloves
round
his
wrists
the
meet
was
so
near
to
them
that
they
had
both
intended
to
ride
their
own
hunters
from
the
door
and
the
two
nags
were
now
being
led
up
and
down
upon
the
gravel
but
at
this
moment
a
terrible
noise
was
heard
to
take
place
in
the
hall
there
was
a
rush
and
crushing
there
which
made
even
prendergast
to
jump
from
his
chair
and
drove
captain
donnellan
to
forget
his
gloves
and
run
to
the
door
it
was
as
though
all
the
winds
of
heaven
were
being
driven
down
the
passage
and
as
though
each
separate
wind
was
shod
with
boots
captain
donnellan
ran
to
the
door
and
prendergast
with
slower
steps
followed
him
when
it
was
opened
owen
was
to
be
seen
in
the
hall
apparently
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
and
the
gentleman
whom
he
had
lately
asked
to
breakfast
he
was
to
be
seen
also
in
a
position
of
unmistakeable
discomfort
he
was
at
that
moment
proceeding
with
the
utmost
violence
into
a
large
round
bed
of
bushes
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
great
sweep
before
the
door
of
the
house
his
feet
just
touching
the
ground
as
he
went
and
then
having
reached
his
bourne
he
penetrated
face
foremost
into
the
thicket
and
in
an
instant
disappeared
he
had
been
kicked
out
of
the
house
owen
fitzgerald
had
taken
him
by
the
shoulders
with
a
run
along
the
passage
and
hall
and
having
reached
the
door
had
applied
the
flat
of
his
foot
violently
to
poor
aby
back
and
sent
him
flying
down
the
stone
steps
and
now
as
captain
donnellan
and
prendergast
stood
looking
on
mollett
junior
buried
himself
altogether
out
of
sight
among
the
shrubs
you
have
done
for
that
fellow
at
any
rate
owen
said
captain
donnellan
glancing
for
a
moment
at
prendergast
i
should
say
that
he
will
never
get
out
of
that
alive
not
if
he
wait
till
i
pick
him
out
said
owen
breathing
very
hard
after
his
exertion
an
infernal
scoundrel
and
now
prendergast
if
you
are
ready
sir
i
am
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
finish
these
few
words
with
that
sang
froid
which
he
desired
to
assume
so
violent
was
his
attempt
at
breathing
after
his
late
exercise
it
was
impossible
not
to
conceive
the
idea
that
as
one
disagreeable
visitor
had
been
disposed
of
in
a
somewhat
summary
fashion
so
might
be
the
other
also
prendergast
did
not
look
like
a
man
who
was
in
the
habit
of
leaving
gentlemen
houses
in
the
manner
just
now
adopted
by
mollett
but
nevertheless
as
they
had
come
together
both
unwished
for
and
unwelcome
captain
donnellan
did
for
a
moment
bethink
himself
whether
there
might
not
be
more
of
such
fun
if
he
remained
there
on
the
spot
at
any
rate
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
go
to
the
hunt
while
such
deeds
as
these
were
being
done
it
might
be
that
his
assistance
would
be
wanted
prendergast
smiled
with
a
saturnine
and
somewhat
bitter
smile
the
nearest
approach
to
a
laugh
in
which
he
was
known
to
indulge
for
the
same
notion
came
also
into
his
head
he
has
disposed
of
him
and
now
he
is
thinking
how
he
will
dispose
of
me
such
was
prendergast
thought
about
the
matter
and
that
made
him
smile
and
then
too
he
was
pleased
at
what
he
had
seen
that
this
mollett
was
the
son
of
that
other
mollett
with
whom
he
had
been
closeted
at
castle
richmond
was
plain
enough
it
was
plain
enough
also
to
him
used
as
he
was
to
trace
out
in
his
mind
the
courses
of
action
which
men
would
follow
that
mollett
junior
having
heard
of
his
father
calamitous
failure
at
castle
richmond
had
come
down
to
hap
house
to
see
what
he
could
make
out
of
the
hitherto
unconscious
heir
it
had
been
matter
of
great
doubt
with
prendergast
when
he
first
heard
young
mollett
name
mentioned
whether
or
no
he
would
allow
him
to
make
his
attempt
he
prendergast
could
by
a
word
have
spoilt
the
game
but
acting
as
he
was
forced
to
act
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
resolved
to
permit
mollett
junior
to
play
out
his
play
he
would
be
yet
in
time
to
prevent
any
ill
result
to
fitzgerald
should
that
gentleman
be
weak
enough
to
succumb
to
any
such
ill
results
as
things
had
now
turned
out
prendergast
rejoiced
that
mollett
junior
had
been
permitted
to
play
out
his
play
and
now
prendergast
if
you
are
ready
i
am
said
owen
perhaps
we
had
better
first
pick
up
the
gentleman
among
the
trees
said
prendergast
and
he
and
captain
donnellan
went
down
into
the
bushes
do
as
you
please
about
that
said
owen
i
have
touched
him
once
and
shall
not
touch
him
again
and
he
walked
back
into
the
one
of
the
grooms
who
were
leading
the
horses
had
now
gone
to
the
assistance
of
the
fallen
hero
and
as
captain
donnellan
also
had
already
penetrated
as
far
as
aby
shoulders
prendergast
thinking
that
he
was
not
needed
returned
also
to
the
house
i
hope
he
is
not
seriously
hurt
he
said
not
he
said
owen
those
sort
of
men
are
as
used
to
be
kicked
as
girls
are
to
be
kissed
and
it
comes
as
naturally
to
them
but
anything
short
of
having
his
bones
broken
will
be
less
than
he
deserves
may
i
ask
what
was
the
nature
of
his
offence
owen
remained
silent
for
a
moment
looking
his
guest
full
in
the
face
well
not
exactly
said
he
he
has
been
talking
of
people
of
whom
he
knows
nothing
but
it
would
not
be
well
for
me
to
repeat
what
he
has
said
to
a
perfect
stranger
quite
right
fitzgerald
it
would
not
be
well
but
there
can
be
no
harm
in
my
repeating
it
to
you
he
came
here
to
get
money
from
you
for
certain
tidings
which
he
brought
tidings
which
if
true
would
be
of
great
importance
to
you
as
i
take
it
however
he
has
altogether
failed
in
his
object
and
how
do
you
come
to
know
all
this
sir
merely
from
having
heard
that
man
mention
his
own
name
i
also
have
come
with
the
same
tidings
and
as
i
ask
for
no
money
for
communicating
them
you
may
believe
them
to
be
true
on
my
telling
what
tidings
asked
owen
with
a
frown
and
an
angry
jerk
in
his
voice
no
remotest
notion
had
yet
come
in
upon
his
mind
that
there
was
any
truth
in
the
story
that
had
been
told
him
he
had
looked
upon
it
all
as
a
lie
and
had
regarded
mollett
as
a
sorry
knave
who
had
come
to
him
with
a
poor
and
low
attempt
at
raising
a
few
pounds
and
even
now
he
did
not
believe
prendergast
words
had
been
too
sudden
to
produce
belief
of
so
great
a
fact
and
his
first
thought
was
that
an
endeavour
was
being
made
to
fool
him
those
tidings
which
that
man
has
told
you
said
prendergast
solemnly
that
you
should
not
have
believed
them
from
him
shows
only
your
discretion
but
from
me
you
may
believe
them
i
have
come
from
castle
richmond
and
am
here
as
a
messenger
from
sir
thomas
from
sir
thomas
and
from
his
son
when
the
matter
became
clear
to
them
both
then
it
was
felt
that
you
also
should
be
made
acquainted
with
it
owen
fitzgerald
now
sat
down
and
looked
up
into
the
lawyer
face
staring
at
him
i
may
say
that
the
power
of
saying
much
was
for
the
moment
taken
away
from
him
by
the
words
that
he
heard
what
was
it
really
possible
that
that
title
that
property
that
place
of
honour
in
the
country
was
to
be
his
when
one
frail
old
man
should
drop
away
and
then
again
was
it
really
true
that
all
this
immeasurable
misery
was
to
fall
had
fallen
upon
that
family
whom
he
had
once
known
so
well
it
was
but
yesterday
that
he
had
been
threatening
all
manner
of
evil
to
his
cousin
herbert
and
had
his
threats
been
proved
true
so
quickly
but
there
was
no
shadow
of
triumph
in
his
feelings
owen
fitzgerald
was
a
man
of
many
faults
he
was
reckless
passionate
prone
to
depreciate
the
opinion
of
others
extravagant
in
his
thoughts
and
habits
ever
ready
to
fight
both
morally
and
physically
those
who
did
not
at
a
moment
notice
agree
with
him
he
was
a
man
who
would
at
once
make
up
his
mind
that
the
world
was
wrong
when
the
world
condemned
him
and
who
would
not
in
compliance
with
any
argument
allow
himself
to
be
so
but
he
was
not
avaricious
nor
cruel
nor
nor
vindictive
in
his
anger
he
could
pronounce
all
manner
of
ill
things
against
his
enemy
as
he
had
pronounced
some
ill
things
against
herbert
but
it
was
not
in
him
to
keep
up
a
sustained
wish
that
those
ill
things
should
really
come
to
pass
this
news
which
he
now
heard
and
which
he
did
not
yet
fully
credit
struck
him
with
awe
but
created
no
triumph
in
his
bosom
he
realized
the
catastrophe
as
it
affected
his
cousins
of
castle
richmond
rather
than
as
it
affected
himself
do
you
mean
to
say
that
lady
fitzgerald
and
then
he
stopped
himself
he
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
the
question
which
was
in
his
mind
could
it
really
be
the
case
that
lady
fitzgerald
that
she
whom
all
the
world
had
so
long
honoured
under
that
name
was
in
truth
the
wife
of
that
man
father
of
the
father
of
that
wretch
whom
he
had
just
spurned
from
his
house
the
tragedy
was
so
deep
that
he
could
not
believe
in
it
we
fear
that
it
is
so
fitzgerald
said
prendergast
that
it
certainly
is
so
i
can
not
say
and
therefore
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
to
give
you
counsel
i
would
advise
you
not
to
make
too
certain
of
this
change
in
your
prospects
too
certain
said
he
with
a
bitter
laugh
do
you
suppose
then
that
i
would
wish
to
see
all
this
ruin
accomplished
heavens
and
earth
lady
fitzgerald
i
can
not
believe
it
and
then
captain
donnellan
also
returned
to
the
room
fitzgerald
said
he
what
the
mischief
are
we
to
do
with
this
fellow
he
says
that
he
ca
walk
and
he
bleeds
from
his
face
like
a
pig
what
fellow
oh
do
what
you
like
with
him
here
give
him
a
pound
note
and
let
him
go
to
the
d
and
donnellan
for
heaven
sake
go
to
cecilstown
at
once
do
not
wait
for
me
i
have
business
that
will
keep
me
here
all
day
but
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
this
fellow
that
bleeding
said
the
captain
piteously
as
he
took
the
proffered
note
if
he
puts
up
with
a
pound
note
for
what
you
done
to
him
he
softer
than
what
i
take
him
for
he
will
be
very
glad
to
be
allowed
to
escape
without
being
given
up
to
the
police
said
prendergast
but
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
him
said
captain
donnellan
he
says
that
he
ca
stand
then
lay
him
down
on
the
dunghill
said
owen
fitzgerald
but
for
heaven
sake
do
not
let
him
interrupt
me
and
donnellan
you
will
altogether
lose
the
day
if
you
stay
any
longer
whereupon
the
captain
seeing
that
in
very
truth
he
was
not
wanted
did
take
himself
off
casting
as
he
went
one
farewell
look
on
aby
as
he
lay
groaning
on
the
turf
on
the
far
side
of
the
tuft
of
bushes
he
kilt
intirely
i
thinking
yer
honor
said
thady
who
was
standing
over
him
on
the
other
side
he
come
to
life
again
before
said
the
captain
oh
in
course
he
do
that
yer
honor
said
thady
and
then
added
sotto
voce
to
himself
as
the
captain
rode
down
the
avenue
faix
an
i
do
know
about
that
shure
an
it
the
masther
has
a
heavy
hand
and
then
thady
stood
for
a
while
perplexed
endeavouring
to
reanimate
aby
by
a
sight
of
the
pound
note
which
he
held
out
visibly
between
his
thumb
and
fingers
and
now
prendergast
and
owen
were
again
alone
and
what
am
i
to
do
said
owen
after
a
pause
of
a
minute
or
two
and
he
asked
the
question
with
a
serious
solemn
voice
just
for
the
present
for
the
next
day
or
two
i
think
that
you
should
do
nothing
as
soon
as
the
first
agony
of
this
time
is
over
at
castle
richmond
i
think
that
herbert
should
see
you
it
would
be
very
desirable
that
he
and
you
should
take
in
concert
such
proceedings
as
will
certainly
become
necessary
the
absolute
proof
of
the
truth
of
this
story
must
be
obtained
you
understand
i
hope
fitzgerald
that
the
case
still
admits
of
doubt
owen
nodded
his
head
impatiently
as
though
it
were
needless
on
the
part
of
prendergast
to
insist
upon
this
he
did
not
wish
to
take
it
for
true
a
moment
sooner
than
was
necessary
it
is
my
duty
to
give
you
this
caution
many
lawyers
i
presume
you
know
that
i
am
a
lawyer
i
did
not
know
it
said
owen
but
it
makes
no
difference
thank
you
that
very
kind
said
prendergast
but
the
sarcasm
was
altogether
lost
upon
his
hearer
some
lawyers
as
i
was
saying
would
in
such
a
case
have
advised
their
clients
to
keep
all
their
suspicions
nay
all
their
knowledge
to
themselves
why
play
the
game
of
an
adversary
they
would
ask
but
i
have
thought
it
better
that
we
should
have
no
adversary
and
you
will
have
none
said
owen
none
in
me
at
least
i
am
much
gratified
in
so
perceiving
and
in
having
such
evidence
that
my
advice
has
not
been
indiscreet
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
you
received
the
first
intimation
of
these
circumstances
from
other
sources
you
would
be
bound
on
your
own
behalf
to
employ
an
agent
to
look
after
your
own
interests
i
should
have
done
nothing
of
the
kind
said
owen
ah
but
my
dear
young
friend
in
such
a
case
it
would
have
been
your
duty
to
do
so
then
i
should
have
neglected
my
duty
and
do
you
tell
herbert
this
from
me
that
let
the
truth
be
what
it
may
i
shall
never
interrupt
him
in
his
title
or
his
property
it
is
not
there
that
i
shall
look
either
for
justice
or
revenge
he
will
understand
what
i
mean
but
prendergast
did
not
by
any
means
nor
did
he
enter
into
the
tone
of
owen
fitzgerald
mind
they
were
both
just
men
but
just
in
an
essentially
different
manner
the
justice
of
prendergast
had
come
of
thought
and
education
as
a
young
man
when
entering
on
his
profession
he
was
probably
less
just
than
he
was
now
he
had
thought
about
matters
of
law
and
equity
till
thought
had
shown
to
him
the
beauty
of
equity
as
it
should
be
practised
often
by
the
aid
of
law
and
not
unfrequently
in
spite
of
law
such
was
the
justice
of
prendergast
that
of
owen
fitzgerald
had
come
of
impulse
and
nature
and
was
the
justice
of
a
very
young
man
rather
than
of
a
very
wise
one
that
title
and
property
did
not
as
he
felt
of
justice
belong
to
him
but
to
his
cousin
what
difference
could
it
make
in
the
true
justice
of
things
whether
or
no
that
wretched
man
was
still
alive
whom
all
the
world
had
regarded
as
dead
in
justice
he
ought
to
be
dead
now
that
this
calamity
of
the
man
life
had
fallen
upon
sir
thomas
and
lady
fitzgerald
and
his
cousin
herbert
it
would
not
be
for
him
to
aggravate
it
by
seizing
upon
a
heritage
which
might
possibly
accrue
to
him
under
the
letter
of
the
world
law
but
which
could
not
accrue
to
him
under
heaven
law
such
was
the
justice
of
owen
fitzgerald
and
we
may
say
this
of
it
in
its
dispraise
as
comparing
it
with
that
other
justice
that
whereas
that
of
prendergast
would
wear
for
ever
through
ages
and
ages
that
other
justice
of
owen
would
hardly
have
stood
the
pull
of
a
ten
struggle
when
children
came
to
him
would
he
not
have
thought
of
what
might
have
been
theirs
by
right
and
then
have
thought
of
what
ought
to
be
theirs
by
right
and
so
on
but
in
speaking
of
justice
he
had
also
spoken
of
revenge
and
prendergast
was
altogether
in
the
dark
what
revenge
he
did
not
know
that
poor
owen
had
lost
a
love
and
that
herbert
had
found
it
in
the
midst
of
all
the
confused
thoughts
which
this
astounding
intelligence
had
brought
upon
him
owen
still
thought
of
his
love
there
herbert
had
robbed
him
robbed
him
by
means
of
his
wealth
and
in
that
matter
he
desired
justice
justice
or
revenge
he
wanted
back
his
love
let
him
have
that
and
herbert
might
yet
be
welcome
to
his
title
and
estates
prendergast
remained
there
for
some
longer
explaining
what
ought
to
be
done
and
how
it
ought
to
be
done
of
course
he
combated
that
idea
of
owen
that
the
property
might
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
wrong
heir
had
that
been
consonant
with
his
ideas
of
justice
he
would
not
have
made
his
visit
to
hap
house
this
morning
right
must
have
its
way
and
if
it
should
be
that
lady
fitzgerald
marriage
with
sir
thomas
had
not
been
legal
owen
on
sir
thomas
death
must
become
sir
owen
and
herbert
could
not
become
sir
herbert
so
much
to
the
mind
of
prendergast
was
as
clear
as
crystal
let
justice
be
done
even
though
these
castle
richmond
heavens
should
fall
in
ruins
and
then
he
took
his
departure
leaving
owen
to
his
solitude
much
perplexed
and
where
is
that
man
prendergast
asked
as
he
got
on
to
his
car
bedad
thin
yer
honer
he
very
bad
intirely
he
jist
sitthing
over
the
kitchen
fire
moaning
and
croning
this
way
and
that
but
sorrow
a
word
he
spoke
since
the
masther
hoisted
him
out
o
the
big
hall
door
and
thin
for
blood
why
saving
yer
honer
presence
one
mash
of
gore
you
better
wash
his
face
for
him
and
give
him
a
little
tea
said
prendergast
and
then
he
drove
away
and
strange
ideas
floated
across
owen
fitzgerald
brain
as
he
sat
there
alone
in
his
hunting
gear
leaning
on
the
still
covered
they
floated
across
his
brain
backwards
and
forwards
and
at
last
remained
there
taking
almost
the
form
of
a
definite
purpose
he
would
make
a
bargain
with
herbert
let
each
of
them
keep
that
which
was
fairly
his
own
let
herbert
have
all
the
broad
lands
of
castle
richmond
let
him
have
the
title
the
seat
in
parliament
and
the
county
honour
but
for
him
owen
let
him
have
clara
desmond
he
desired
nothing
that
was
not
fairly
his
own
but
as
his
own
he
did
regard
her
and
without
her
he
did
not
know
how
to
face
the
future
of
his
life
and
in
suggesting
this
arrangement
to
himself
he
did
not
altogether
throw
over
her
feelings
he
did
take
into
account
her
heart
though
he
did
not
take
into
account
her
worldly
prospects
she
had
loved
him
him
owen
and
he
would
not
teach
himself
to
believe
that
she
did
not
love
him
still
her
mother
had
been
too
powerful
for
her
and
she
had
weakly
yielded
but
as
to
her
heart
owen
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
that
was
gone
from
him
they
two
would
make
a
bargain
he
and
his
cousin
honour
and
renown
and
the
money
and
the
title
would
be
everything
to
his
cousin
herbert
had
been
brought
up
to
expect
these
things
and
all
the
world
around
him
had
expected
them
for
him
it
would
be
terrible
to
him
to
find
himself
robbed
of
them
but
the
loss
of
clara
desmond
was
equally
terrible
to
owen
fitzgerald
he
allowed
his
heart
to
fill
itself
with
a
romantic
sense
of
honour
teaching
him
that
it
behoved
him
as
a
man
not
to
give
up
his
love
without
her
he
would
live
disgraced
in
his
own
estimation
but
who
would
not
think
the
better
of
him
for
refraining
from
the
possession
of
those
castle
richmond
acres
yes
he
would
make
a
bargain
with
herbert
who
was
there
in
the
world
to
deny
his
right
to
do
so
as
he
sat
revolving
these
things
in
his
mind
he
suddenly
heard
a
rushing
sound
as
of
many
horsemen
down
the
avenue
and
going
to
the
window
he
saw
two
or
three
leading
men
of
the
hunt
accompanied
by
the
old
huntsman
and
through
and
about
and
under
the
horsemen
were
the
dogs
running
in
and
out
of
the
laurels
which
skirted
the
road
with
their
noses
down
giving
every
now
and
then
short
yelps
as
they
caught
up
the
uncertain
scent
from
the
leaves
on
the
ground
and
hurried
on
upon
the
trail
of
their
game
yo
ho
to
him
messenger
hark
to
him
maybird
good
bitch
merrylass
he
down
here
and
he
never
get
away
alive
he
came
to
a
bad
place
when
he
looked
out
for
going
to
ground
anywhere
near
mr
owen
and
then
there
came
fast
trotting
down
through
the
other
horsemen
making
his
way
eagerly
to
the
front
a
stout
heavy
man
with
a
florid
handsome
face
and
eager
eye
he
might
be
some
fifty
years
of
age
but
no
lad
there
of
was
so
anxious
and
impetuous
as
he
he
was
riding
a
bay
horse
that
pressed
on
as
eagerly
as
his
rider
as
he
hurried
forward
all
made
way
for
him
till
he
was
close
to
the
shrubs
in
the
front
of
the
house
bless
my
soul
gentlemen
he
said
in
an
angry
voice
how
in
the
name
of
all
that
good
are
hounds
to
hunt
if
you
press
them
down
the
road
in
that
way
by
heavens
barry
you
are
enough
to
drive
a
man
wild
yoicks
merrylass
there
it
is
pat
pat
was
the
huntsman
outside
the
low
wall
there
down
towards
the
river
this
was
sam
the
master
of
the
duhallow
hounds
the
god
of
idolatry
no
better
fellow
ever
lived
and
no
master
of
hounds
so
good
such
at
least
was
the
opinion
common
among
duhallow
sportsmen
yes
yer
honer
he
did
skirt
round
there
i
knows
that
but
been
among
them
laurels
at
the
bottom
and
he
be
about
the
place
and
outhouses
somewhere
there
a
drain
here
that
i
knows
on
and
he
knows
on
but
owen
he
knows
on
it
too
and
there
aint
a
chance
for
him
so
argued
pat
the
duhallow
huntsman
the
experienced
craft
of
whose
aged
mind
enabled
him
to
run
counter
to
the
cutest
dodges
of
the
cutest
fox
in
that
and
any
of
the
three
neighbouring
baronies
and
now
the
sweep
before
the
door
was
crowded
with
red
coats
and
owen
looking
from
his
window
felt
that
he
must
take
some
step
as
an
ordinary
rule
had
the
hunt
thus
drifted
near
his
homestead
he
would
have
been
off
his
horse
and
down
among
his
bottles
sending
up
sherry
and
and
there
would
have
been
comfortable
drink
in
plenty
and
cold
meat
perhaps
not
in
plenty
and
every
one
would
have
been
welcome
in
and
out
of
the
house
but
now
there
was
that
at
his
heart
which
forbade
him
to
mix
with
the
men
who
knew
him
so
well
and
among
whom
he
was
customarily
so
loudly
joyous
dressed
as
he
was
he
could
not
go
among
them
without
explaining
why
he
had
remained
at
home
and
as
to
that
he
felt
that
he
was
not
able
to
give
any
explanation
at
the
present
moment
what
the
matter
with
owen
said
one
fellow
to
captain
donnellan
upon
my
word
i
hardly
know
two
chaps
came
to
him
this
morning
before
he
was
up
about
business
they
said
he
nearly
murdered
one
of
them
out
of
hand
and
i
believe
that
he
locked
up
somewhere
with
the
other
this
minute
but
in
the
meantime
a
servant
came
up
to
and
touching
his
hat
asked
the
master
of
the
hunt
to
go
into
the
house
for
a
moment
and
then
dismounting
entered
in
through
the
front
door
he
was
only
there
two
minutes
for
his
mind
was
still
outside
among
the
laurels
with
the
fox
but
as
he
put
his
foot
again
into
the
stirrup
he
said
to
those
around
him
that
they
must
hurry
away
and
not
disturb
owen
fitzgerald
that
day
it
may
therefore
easily
be
imagined
that
the
mystery
would
spread
quickly
through
that
portion
of
the
county
of
cork
they
must
hurry
away
but
not
before
they
could
give
an
account
of
their
fox
neither
for
gods
nor
men
must
he
be
left
as
long
as
his
skin
was
whole
above
ground
there
is
an
importance
attaching
to
the
pursuit
of
a
fox
which
gives
it
a
character
quite
distinct
from
that
of
any
other
amusement
which
men
follow
in
these
realms
it
justifies
almost
anything
that
men
can
do
and
that
at
any
place
and
in
any
season
there
is
about
it
a
sanctity
which
forbids
interruption
and
makes
its
votaries
safe
under
any
circumstances
of
trespass
or
intrusion
a
man
in
a
hunting
county
who
opposes
the
county
hunt
must
be
a
misanthrope
willing
to
live
in
seclusion
fond
of
being
in
coventry
and
in
love
with
the
enmity
of
his
there
are
such
men
but
they
are
regarded
as
lepers
by
those
around
them
all
this
adds
to
the
nobleness
of
the
noble
sport
and
makes
it
worthy
of
a
man
energies
and
then
the
crowd
of
huntsmen
hurried
round
from
the
front
of
the
house
to
a
paddock
at
the
back
and
then
again
through
the
stable
yard
to
the
front
the
hounds
were
about
here
there
and
everywhere
as
any
one
ignorant
of
the
craft
would
have
said
but
still
always
on
the
scent
of
that
doomed
beast
from
one
thicket
to
another
he
tried
to
hide
himself
but
the
moist
leaves
of
the
underwood
told
quickly
of
his
whereabouts
he
tried
every
hole
and
cranny
about
the
house
but
every
hole
and
corner
had
been
stopped
by
owen
jealous
care
he
would
have
lived
disgraced
for
ever
in
his
own
estimation
had
a
fox
gone
to
ground
anywhere
about
his
domicile
at
last
a
loud
whoop
was
heard
just
in
front
of
the
hall
door
the
poor
fox
with
his
last
gasp
of
strength
had
betaken
himself
to
the
thicket
before
the
door
and
there
the
dogs
had
killed
him
at
the
very
spot
on
which
aby
mollett
had
fallen
standing
well
back
from
the
window
still
thinking
of
clara
desmond
owen
fitzgerald
saw
the
fate
of
the
hunted
animal
he
saw
the
head
and
tail
severed
from
the
carcase
by
old
pat
and
the
body
thrown
to
the
hounds
a
ceremony
over
which
he
had
presided
so
many
scores
of
times
and
then
when
the
dogs
had
ceased
to
growl
over
the
bloody
fragments
he
saw
the
hunt
move
away
back
along
the
avenue
to
the
high
road
all
this
he
saw
but
still
he
was
thinking
of
clara
desmond
chapter
xxv
a
muddy
walk
on
a
wet
morning
all
that
day
of
the
hunt
was
passed
very
quietly
at
castle
richmond
herbert
did
not
once
leave
the
house
having
begged
somers
to
make
his
excuse
at
a
relief
committee
which
it
would
have
been
his
business
to
attend
a
great
portion
of
the
day
he
spent
with
his
father
who
lay
all
but
motionless
in
a
state
that
was
apparently
half
comatose
during
all
those
long
hours
very
little
was
said
between
them
about
this
tragedy
of
their
family
why
should
more
be
said
now
now
that
the
worst
had
befallen
them
all
that
worst
to
hide
which
sir
thomas
had
endured
such
superhuman
agony
and
then
four
or
five
times
during
the
day
he
went
to
his
mother
but
with
her
he
did
not
stay
long
to
her
he
could
hardly
speak
upon
any
subject
for
to
her
as
yet
the
story
had
not
been
told
and
she
when
he
thus
came
to
her
from
time
to
time
with
a
soft
word
or
two
or
a
softer
kiss
would
ask
him
no
question
she
knew
that
he
had
learned
the
whole
and
knew
also
from
the
solemn
cloud
on
his
brow
that
that
whole
must
be
very
dreadful
indeed
we
may
surmise
that
her
woman
heart
had
by
this
time
guessed
somewhat
of
the
truth
but
she
would
inquire
of
no
one
jones
she
was
sure
knew
it
all
but
she
did
not
ask
a
single
question
of
her
servant
it
would
be
told
to
her
when
it
was
fitting
why
should
she
move
in
the
matter
whenever
herbert
entered
her
room
she
tried
to
receive
him
with
something
of
a
smile
it
was
clear
enough
that
she
was
always
glad
of
his
coming
and
that
she
made
some
little
show
of
welcoming
him
a
book
was
always
put
away
very
softly
and
by
the
slightest
motion
but
herbert
well
knew
what
that
book
was
and
whence
his
mother
sought
that
strength
which
enabled
her
to
live
through
such
an
ordeal
as
this
and
his
sisters
were
to
be
seen
moving
slowly
about
the
house
like
the
very
ghosts
of
their
former
selves
their
voices
were
hardly
heard
no
ring
of
customary
laughter
ever
came
from
the
room
in
which
they
sat
when
they
passed
their
brother
in
the
house
they
hardly
dared
to
whisper
to
him
as
to
sitting
down
at
table
now
with
prendergast
that
effort
was
wholly
abandoned
they
kept
themselves
even
from
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
aunt
letty
perhaps
spoke
more
than
the
others
but
what
could
she
speak
to
the
purpose
herbert
she
once
said
as
she
caught
him
close
by
the
door
of
the
library
and
almost
pulled
him
into
the
room
herbert
i
charge
you
to
tell
me
what
all
this
is
i
can
tell
you
nothing
dear
aunt
nothing
nothing
as
yet
but
herbert
tell
me
this
is
it
about
my
sister
for
very
many
years
past
aunt
letty
had
always
called
lady
fitzgerald
her
sister
i
can
tell
you
nothing
nothing
then
i
do
not
know
we
must
let
prendergast
manage
this
matter
as
he
will
i
have
taken
nothing
on
myself
aunt
letty
nothing
then
i
tell
you
what
herbert
it
will
kill
me
it
will
kill
us
all
as
it
is
killing
your
father
and
your
darling
mother
i
tell
you
that
it
is
killing
her
fast
human
nature
can
not
bear
it
for
myself
i
could
endure
anything
if
i
were
trusted
and
sitting
down
in
one
of
the
library
chairs
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
a
sight
which
as
regarded
aunt
letty
herbert
had
never
seen
before
what
if
they
all
died
thought
herbert
to
himself
in
the
bitterness
of
the
moment
there
was
that
in
store
for
some
of
them
which
was
worse
than
death
what
business
had
aunt
letty
to
talk
of
her
misery
of
course
she
was
wretched
as
they
all
were
but
how
could
she
appreciate
the
burden
that
was
on
his
back
what
was
clara
desmond
to
her
shortly
after
noon
prendergast
was
back
at
the
house
but
he
slunk
up
to
his
room
and
no
one
saw
anything
of
him
at
six
he
came
down
and
herbert
constrained
himself
to
sit
at
the
table
while
dinner
was
served
and
so
the
day
passed
away
one
more
day
only
prendergast
was
to
stay
at
castle
richmond
and
then
if
as
he
expected
certain
letters
should
reach
him
on
that
morning
he
was
to
start
for
london
late
on
the
following
day
it
may
well
be
imagined
that
he
was
not
desirous
of
prolonging
his
visit
early
on
the
following
morning
herbert
started
for
a
long
solitary
walk
on
that
day
prendergast
was
to
tell
everything
to
his
mother
and
it
was
determined
between
them
that
her
son
should
not
be
in
the
house
during
the
telling
in
the
evening
when
he
came
home
he
was
to
see
her
so
he
started
on
his
walk
resolving
some
other
things
also
in
his
mind
before
he
went
he
would
reach
desmond
court
before
he
returned
home
that
day
and
let
the
two
ladies
there
know
the
fate
that
was
before
them
then
after
that
they
might
let
him
know
what
was
to
be
his
fate
but
on
this
head
he
would
not
hurry
them
so
he
started
on
his
walk
resolving
to
go
round
by
gortnaclough
on
his
way
to
desmond
court
and
then
to
return
home
from
that
place
the
road
would
be
more
than
twenty
long
irish
miles
but
he
felt
that
the
hard
work
would
be
of
service
it
was
instinct
rather
than
thought
which
taught
him
that
it
would
be
good
for
him
to
put
some
strain
on
the
muscles
of
his
body
and
thus
relieve
the
muscles
of
his
mind
if
his
limbs
could
become
thoroughly
tired
thoroughly
tired
so
that
he
might
wish
to
rest
then
he
might
hope
that
for
a
moment
he
might
cease
to
think
of
all
this
sorrow
which
encompassed
him
so
he
started
on
his
walk
taking
with
him
a
thick
cudgel
and
his
own
thoughts
he
went
away
across
the
demesne
and
down
into
the
road
that
led
away
by
gortnaclough
and
boherbue
towards
castleisland
and
the
wilds
of
county
kerry
as
he
went
the
men
about
the
place
refrained
from
speaking
to
him
for
they
all
knew
that
bad
news
had
come
to
the
big
house
they
looked
at
him
with
lowered
eyes
and
with
tenderness
in
their
hearts
for
they
loved
the
very
name
of
fitzgerald
the
love
which
a
poor
irishman
feels
for
the
gentleman
whom
he
regards
as
his
master
his
masther
though
he
has
probably
never
received
from
him
in
money
wages
for
a
day
work
and
in
all
his
intercourse
has
been
the
man
who
has
paid
money
and
not
the
man
who
received
it
the
love
which
he
nevertheless
feels
if
he
has
been
occasionally
looked
on
with
a
smiling
face
and
accosted
with
a
kindly
word
is
astonishing
to
an
englishman
i
will
not
say
that
the
feeling
is
altogether
good
love
should
come
of
love
where
personal
love
exists
on
one
side
and
not
even
personal
regard
on
the
other
there
must
be
some
mixture
of
servility
that
unbounded
respect
for
human
grandeur
can
not
be
altogether
good
for
human
greatness
if
the
greatness
be
properly
sifted
it
may
be
so
he
got
down
into
the
road
and
went
forth
upon
his
journey
at
a
rapid
pace
the
mud
was
deep
upon
the
way
but
he
went
through
the
thickest
without
a
thought
of
it
he
had
not
been
out
long
before
there
came
on
a
cold
light
drizzling
rain
such
a
rain
as
gradually
but
surely
makes
its
way
into
the
innermost
rag
of
a
man
clothing
running
up
the
inside
of
his
waterproof
coat
and
penetrating
by
its
perseverance
the
very
folds
of
his
necktie
such
cold
drizzling
rain
is
the
commonest
phase
of
hard
weather
during
irish
winters
and
those
who
are
out
and
about
get
used
to
it
and
treat
it
tenderly
they
are
euphemistical
as
to
the
weather
calling
it
hazy
and
soft
and
never
allowing
themselves
to
carry
bad
language
on
such
a
subject
beyond
the
word
dull
and
yet
at
such
a
time
one
breathes
the
rain
and
again
exhales
it
and
become
as
it
were
oneself
a
water
spirit
assuming
an
aqueous
fishlike
nature
into
one
inner
fibres
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
a
man
does
sometimes
get
wet
in
ireland
but
then
a
wetting
there
brings
no
cold
in
the
head
no
husky
voice
no
need
for
multitudinous
as
it
does
here
in
this
land
of
catarrhs
it
is
the
east
wind
and
not
the
rain
that
kills
and
of
east
wind
in
the
south
of
ireland
they
know
nothing
but
herbert
walked
on
quite
unmindful
of
the
mist
swinging
his
thick
stick
in
his
hand
and
ever
increasing
his
pace
as
he
went
he
was
usually
a
man
careful
of
such
things
but
it
was
nothing
to
him
now
whether
he
were
wet
or
dry
his
mind
was
so
full
of
the
immediate
circumstances
of
his
destiny
that
he
could
not
think
of
small
external
accidents
what
was
to
be
his
future
life
in
this
world
and
how
was
he
to
fight
the
battle
that
was
now
before
him
that
was
the
question
which
he
continually
asked
himself
and
yet
never
succeeded
in
answering
how
was
he
to
come
down
from
the
throne
on
which
early
circumstances
had
placed
him
and
hustle
and
struggle
among
the
crowd
for
such
approach
to
other
thrones
as
his
sinews
and
shoulders
might
procure
for
him
if
he
had
been
only
born
to
the
struggle
he
said
to
himself
how
easy
and
pleasant
it
would
have
been
to
him
but
to
find
himself
thus
cast
out
from
his
place
by
an
accident
cast
out
with
the
eyes
of
all
the
world
upon
him
to
be
talked
of
and
pointed
at
and
pitied
to
have
little
aids
offered
him
by
men
whom
he
regarded
as
beneath
him
all
this
was
terribly
sore
and
the
burden
was
almost
too
much
for
his
strength
i
do
not
care
for
the
money
he
said
to
himself
a
dozen
times
and
in
saying
so
he
spoke
in
one
sense
truly
but
he
did
care
for
things
which
money
buys
for
outward
respect
permission
to
speak
with
authority
among
his
for
power
and
place
and
the
feeling
that
he
was
prominent
in
his
walk
of
life
to
be
in
advance
of
other
men
that
is
the
desire
which
is
strongest
in
the
hearts
of
all
strong
men
and
in
that
desire
how
terrible
a
fall
had
he
not
received
from
this
catastrophe
and
what
were
they
all
to
do
he
and
his
mother
and
his
sisters
how
were
they
to
act
now
at
once
in
what
way
were
they
to
carry
themselves
when
this
man
of
law
and
judgment
should
have
gone
from
them
for
himself
his
course
of
action
must
depend
much
upon
the
word
which
might
be
spoken
to
him
at
desmond
court
there
would
still
be
a
drop
of
comfort
left
at
the
bottom
of
his
cup
if
he
might
be
allowed
to
hope
there
but
in
truth
he
feared
greatly
what
the
countess
would
say
to
him
he
thought
he
could
foretell
what
it
would
behove
him
to
say
himself
in
matter
though
not
in
words
that
he
knew
well
would
not
the
two
sayings
tally
well
together
and
could
it
be
right
for
him
even
to
hope
that
the
love
of
a
girl
of
seventeen
should
stand
firm
against
her
mother
will
when
her
lover
himself
could
not
dare
to
press
his
suit
and
then
another
reflection
pressed
on
his
mind
sorely
clara
had
already
given
up
one
poor
lover
at
her
mother
instance
might
she
not
resume
that
lover
also
at
her
mother
instance
now
that
he
was
no
longer
poor
what
if
owen
fitzgerald
should
take
from
him
everything
and
so
he
walked
on
through
the
mud
and
rain
always
swinging
his
big
stick
perhaps
after
all
the
worst
of
it
was
over
with
him
when
he
could
argue
with
himself
in
this
way
it
is
the
first
plunge
into
the
cold
water
that
gives
the
shock
we
may
almost
say
that
every
human
misery
will
cease
to
be
miserable
if
it
be
duly
faced
and
something
is
done
towards
conquering
our
miseries
when
we
face
them
in
any
degree
even
if
not
with
due
courage
herbert
had
taken
his
plunge
into
the
deep
dark
cold
comfortless
pool
of
misfortune
and
he
felt
that
the
waters
around
him
were
very
cold
but
the
plunge
had
been
taken
and
the
worst
perhaps
was
gone
by
as
he
approached
near
to
gortnaclough
he
came
upon
one
of
those
gangs
of
who
were
now
at
work
everywhere
earning
their
pittance
of
yellow
meal
with
a
pickaxe
and
a
wheelbarrow
in
some
sort
or
other
the
labourers
had
been
got
to
their
work
gangsmen
there
were
with
lists
who
did
see
more
or
less
accurately
that
the
men
before
they
received
their
sixpence
or
eightpence
for
their
day
work
did
at
any
rate
pass
their
day
with
some
sort
of
tool
in
their
hands
and
consequently
the
surface
of
the
hill
began
to
disappear
and
there
were
chasms
in
the
road
which
caused
those
who
travelled
on
wheels
to
sit
still
staring
across
with
angry
eyes
and
sometimes
to
apostrophize
the
doer
of
these
deeds
with
very
naughty
words
the
doer
was
the
board
of
works
or
the
board
as
it
was
familiarly
termed
and
were
it
not
that
those
ill
words
must
have
returned
to
the
bosoms
which
vented
them
and
have
flown
no
further
no
board
could
ever
have
been
so
terribly
to
find
oneself
at
last
utterly
stopped
after
proceeding
with
great
strain
to
one
horse
for
half
a
mile
through
an
artificial
quagmire
of
slush
up
to
the
wheelbox
is
harassing
to
the
customary
traveller
and
men
at
that
crisis
did
not
bethink
themselves
quite
so
frequently
as
they
should
have
done
that
a
people
perishing
from
famine
is
more
harassing
but
herbert
was
not
on
wheels
and
was
proceeding
through
the
slush
and
across
the
chasm
regardless
of
it
all
when
he
was
stopped
by
some
of
the
men
all
the
land
thereabouts
was
castle
richmond
property
and
it
was
not
probable
that
the
young
master
of
it
all
would
be
allowed
to
pass
through
some
two
score
of
his
own
tenantry
without
greetings
and
petitions
and
blessings
and
complaints
faix
yer
honer
thin
herbert
said
one
man
standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
with
the
wheelbarrow
still
hanging
in
his
hands
an
englishman
would
have
put
down
the
barrow
while
he
was
speaking
making
some
inner
calculation
about
the
waste
of
his
muscles
but
an
irishman
would
despise
himself
for
such
low
economy
faix
thin
yer
honer
herbert
an
it
yourself
is
a
sight
good
for
sore
eyes
may
the
heavens
be
your
bed
for
it
you
is
the
frind
to
a
poor
man
how
are
you
pat
said
herbert
without
intending
to
stop
how
are
you
mooney
i
hope
the
work
suits
you
all
and
then
he
would
at
once
have
passed
on
with
his
hat
pressed
down
low
over
his
brow
but
this
could
be
by
no
means
allowed
in
the
first
place
the
excitement
arising
from
the
young
master
presence
was
too
valuable
to
be
lost
so
suddenly
and
then
when
might
again
occur
so
excellent
a
time
for
some
mention
of
their
heavy
grievances
men
whose
whole
amount
of
worldly
good
consists
in
a
bare
allowance
of
nauseous
food
just
sufficient
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
must
be
excused
if
they
wish
to
utter
their
complaints
to
ears
that
can
hear
them
arrah
yer
honer
thin
we
none
on
us
very
well
and
how
could
we
with
the
male
at
a
penny
a
pound
said
pat
sorrow
to
it
for

said
mooney
it
the
worst
vittles
iver
a
man
tooked
into
the
inside
of
him
saving
yer
honer
presence
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
raise
the
bare
arm
of
me
since
the
day
i
first
began
with
the
yally
male
it
as
wake
as
cats
we
all
is
said
another
who
from
the
weary
way
in
which
he
dragged
his
limbs
about
certainly
did
not
himself
seem
to
be
gifted
with
much
animal
strength
and
the
childer
is
worse

said
a
fourth
the

is
bad
for

intirely
saving
yer

gone
away
most
to
nothing
and
there
six
of

in

six
mouths
to

and
what
eight
pennorth
of
yally
male
among
such
a
lot
as
that
let
alone
the
sundays
when
there
nothing
an
shure
herbert
said
another
a
small
man
with
a
squeaking
voice
whose
rags
of
clothes
hardly
hung
on
to
his
body
war
i
here
with
the
other
boys
the
last
friday
as
iver
was
ax
pat
condon
else
yer
honer
and
yet
when
they
comed
to
give
out
the
wages
they
sconced
me
of
and
so
on
there
were
as
many
complaints
to
be
made
as
there
were
men
if
only
he
could
bring
himself
to
listen
to
them
on
ordinary
occasions
herbert
would
listen
to
them
and
answer
them
and
give
them
at
any
rate
the
satisfaction
which
they
derived
from
discoursing
with
him
if
he
could
give
them
no
other
satisfaction
but
now
on
this
day
with
his
own
burden
so
heavy
at
his
heart
he
could
not
even
do
this
he
could
not
think
of
their
sorrows
his
own
sorrow
seemed
to
him
to
be
so
much
the
heavier
so
he
passed
on
running
the
gauntlet
through
them
as
best
he
might
and
shaking
them
off
from
him
as
they
attempted
to
cling
round
his
steps
nothing
is
so
powerful
in
making
a
man
selfish
as
misfortune
and
then
he
went
on
to
gortnaclough
he
had
not
chosen
his
walk
to
this
place
with
any
fixed
object
except
this
perhaps
that
it
enabled
him
to
return
home
round
by
desmond
court
it
was
one
of
the
places
at
which
a
relief
committee
sat
every
fortnight
and
there
was
a
here
which
however
had
not
been
so
successful
as
the
one
at
berryhill
and
it
was
the
place
of
residence
selected
by
father
barney
coadjutor
but
in
spite
of
all
this
when
herbert
found
himself
in
the
wretched
dirty
straggling
damp
street
of
the
village
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
or
where
to
betake
himself
that
every
eye
in
gortnaclough
would
be
upon
him
was
a
matter
of
course
he
could
hardly
turn
round
on
his
heel
and
retrace
his
steps
through
the
village
as
he
would
have
to
do
in
going
to
desmond
court
without
showing
some
pretext
for
his
coming
there
so
he
walked
into
the
little
shop
which
was
attached
to
the
and
there
he
found
the
rev
columb
creagh
giving
his
orders
to
the
little
girl
behind
the
counter
herbert
fitzgerald
was
customarily
very
civil
to
the
roman
catholic
priests
around
him
somewhat
more
so
indeed
than
seemed
good
to
those
very
excellent
ladies
townsend
and
aunt
letty
but
it
always
went
against
the
grain
with
him
to
be
civil
to
the
rev
columb
creagh
and
on
this
special
day
it
would
have
gone
against
the
grain
with
him
to
be
civil
to
anybody
but
the
coadjutor
knew
his
character
and
was
delighted
to
have
an
opportunity
of
talking
to
him
when
he
could
do
so
without
being
snubbed
either
by
somers
the
chairman
or
by
his
own
parish
priest
creagh
had
rejoiced
much
at
the
idea
of
forming
one
at
the
same
council
board
with
county
magistrates
and
protestant
parsons
but
the
fruition
of
his
promised
delights
had
never
quite
reached
his
lips
he
had
been
like
sancho
panza
in
his
government
he
had
sat
down
to
the
grand
table
day
after
day
but
had
never
yet
been
allowed
to
enjoy
the
rich
dish
of
his
own
oratory
whenever
he
had
proposed
to
help
himself
somers
or
father
barney
had
stopped
his
mouth
now
probably
he
might
be
able
to
say
a
word
or
two
and
though
the
glory
would
not
be
equal
to
that
of
making
a
speech
at
the
committee
still
it
would
be
something
to
be
seen
talking
on
equal
terms
and
on
affairs
of
state
to
the
young
heir
of
castle
richmond
fitzgerald
well
i
declare
and
how
are
you
sir
and
he
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
and
got
hold
of
herbert
hand
shaking
it
ruthlessly
and
altogether
he
made
him
very
disagreeable
herbert
though
his
mind
was
not
really
intent
on
the
subject
asked
some
question
of
the
girl
as
to
the
amount
of
meal
that
had
been
sold
and
desired
to
see
the
little
passbook
that
they
kept
at
the
shop
we
are
doing
pretty
well
fitzgerald
said
the
coadjutor
pretty
well
i
always
keep
my
eye
on
for
fear
things
should
go
wrong
you
know
i
do
think
they
do
that
said
herbert
no
i
hope
not
but
it
always
good
to
be
on
the
safe
side
you
know
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
think
we
altogether
on
the
right
tack
about
them
shops
it
very
hard
on
a
poor
woman
now
the
fact
was
though
the
relief
committee
at
gortnaclough
was
attended
by
magistrates
priests
and
parsons
the
shop
there
was
herbert
fitzgerald
own
affair
it
had
been
stocked
with
his
or
his
father
money
the
flour
was
sold
without
profit
at
his
risk
and
the
rent
of
the
house
and
wages
of
the
woman
who
kept
it
came
out
of
his
own
under
these
circumstances
he
did
not
see
cause
why
creagh
should
interfere
and
at
the
present
moment
was
not
well
inclined
to
put
up
with
such
interference
we
do
the
best
we
can
creagh
said
he
interrupting
the
priest
and
no
good
will
be
done
at
such
a
time
as
this
by
unnecessary
difficulties
no
no
certainly
not
but
still
i
do
think
and
creagh
was
girding
up
his
loins
for
eloquence
when
he
was
again
interrupted
i
am
rather
in
a
hurry
said
herbert
and
therefore
if
you
please
we
wo
make
any
change
now
never
mind
the
book
sally
good
day
mr
creagh
and
so
saying
he
left
the
shop
and
walked
rapidly
back
out
of
the
village
the
poor
coadjutor
was
left
alone
at
the
anathematizing
in
his
heart
the
pride
of
all
protestants
he
had
been
told
that
this
fitzgerald
was
different
from
others
that
he
was
a
man
fond
of
priests
and
addicted
to
the
ould
religion
and
so
hearing
he
had
resolved
to
make
the
most
of
such
an
excellent
disposition
but
he
was
forced
to
confess
to
himself
that
they
were
all
alike
somers
could
not
have
been
more
imperious
nor
townsend
more
insolent
and
then
through
the
still
drizzling
rain
herbert
walked
on
to
desmond
court
by
the
time
that
he
reached
the
lodge
at
the
demesne
gate
he
was
nearly
wet
through
and
was
besmeared
with
mud
up
to
his
knees
but
he
had
thought
nothing
of
this
as
he
walked
along
his
mind
had
been
intent
on
the
scene
that
was
before
him
in
what
words
was
he
to
break
the
news
to
clara
desmond
and
her
mother
and
with
what
words
would
they
receive
the
tidings
the
former
question
he
had
by
no
means
answered
to
his
own
satisfaction
when
all
muddy
and
wet
he
passed
up
to
the
house
through
that
desolate
gate
is
lady
desmond
at
home
he
asked
of
the
butler
her
ladyship
is
at
home
said
the
old
man
with
his
blandest
smile
and
so
is
lady
clara
he
had
already
learned
to
look
on
the
heir
of
castle
richmond
as
the
coming
saviour
of
the
impoverished
desmond
family
chapter
xxvi
comfortless
but
herbert
yer
honor
you
wet
through
and
through
surely
said
the
butler
as
soon
as
fitzgerald
was
well
inside
the
hall
herbert
muttered
something
about
his
being
only
damp
and
that
it
did
not
signify
but
it
did
signify
very
much
in
the
butler
estimation
whose
being
wet
through
could
signify
more
for
was
not
herbert
to
be
a
baronet
and
to
have
the
spending
of
twelve
thousand
a
year
and
would
he
not
be
the
future
husband
of
lady
clara
not
signify
indeed
an
shure
herbert
you
have
walked
to
desmond
court
this
blessed
morning
tare
an
ages
well
there
no
knowing
what
you
young
gentlemen
wo
do
but
i
see
and
get
a
pair
of
trousers
of
my
lord
ready
for
you
in
two
minutes
faix
and
he
nearly
as
big
as
yourself
now
mr
herbert
but
herbert
would
hardly
speak
to
him
and
gave
no
assent
whatever
as
to
his
proposition
for
borrowing
the
earl
clothes
i
go
in
as
i
am
said
he
and
the
old
man
looking
into
his
face
saw
that
there
was
something
wrong
shure
an
he
ai
going
to
sthrike
off
now
said
this
irish
caleb
balderstone
to
himself
he
also
as
well
as
some
others
about
desmond
court
had
feared
greatly
that
lady
clara
would
throw
herself
away
upon
a
poor
lover
it
was
now
past
noon
and
fitzgerald
pressed
forward
into
the
room
in
which
lady
clara
usually
sat
it
was
the
same
in
which
she
had
received
owen
visit
and
here
of
a
morning
she
was
usually
to
be
found
alone
but
on
this
occasion
when
he
opened
the
door
he
found
that
her
mother
was
with
her
since
the
day
on
which
clara
had
disposed
of
herself
so
excellently
the
mother
had
spent
more
of
her
time
with
her
daughter
looking
at
clara
now
through
herbert
fitzgerald
eyes
the
countess
had
began
to
confess
to
herself
that
her
child
did
possess
beauty
and
charm
she
got
up
to
greet
her
future
with
a
sweet
smile
and
that
charming
quiet
welcome
with
which
a
woman
so
well
knows
how
to
make
her
house
pleasant
to
a
man
that
is
welcome
to
it
and
clara
not
rising
but
turning
her
head
round
and
looking
at
him
greeted
him
also
he
came
forward
and
took
both
their
hands
and
it
was
not
till
he
had
held
clara
for
half
a
minute
in
his
own
that
they
both
saw
that
he
was
more
than
ordinarily
serious
i
hope
sir
thomas
is
not
worse
said
lady
desmond
with
that
voice
of
feigned
interest
which
is
so
common
after
all
if
anything
should
happen
to
the
poor
old
weak
gentleman
might
it
not
be
as
well
my
father
has
not
been
very
well
these
last
two
days
he
said
i
am
so
sorry
said
clara
and
your
mother
herbert
but
herbert
how
wet
you
are
you
must
have
walked
said
the
countess
herbert
in
a
few
dull
words
said
that
he
had
walked
he
had
thought
that
the
walk
would
be
good
for
him
and
he
had
not
expected
that
it
would
be
so
wet
and
then
lady
desmond
looking
carefully
into
his
face
saw
that
in
truth
he
was
very
serious
so
much
so
that
she
knew
that
he
had
come
there
on
account
of
his
seriousness
but
still
his
sorrow
did
not
in
any
degree
go
to
her
heart
he
was
grieving
doubtless
for
his
father
or
his
mother
the
house
at
castle
richmond
was
probably
sad
because
sickness
and
fear
of
death
were
there
nay
perhaps
death
itself
now
hanging
over
some
loved
head
but
what
was
this
to
her
she
had
had
her
own
sorrows
enough
of
them
perhaps
to
account
for
her
being
selfish
so
with
a
solemn
face
but
with
nothing
amiss
about
her
heart
she
again
asked
for
tidings
from
castle
richmond
do
tell
us
said
clara
getting
up
i
am
afraid
sir
thomas
is
very
the
old
baronet
had
been
kind
to
her
and
she
did
regard
him
to
her
it
was
a
sorrow
to
think
that
there
should
be
any
sorrow
at
castle
richmond
yes
he
is
ill
said
herbert
we
have
had
a
gentleman
from
london
with
us
for
the
last
few
days
a
friend
of
my
father
his
name
is
mr
prendergast
is
he
a
doctor
asked
the
countess
no
not
a
doctor
said
herbert
he
is
a
lawyer
it
was
very
hard
for
him
to
begin
his
story
and
perhaps
the
more
so
in
that
he
was
wet
through
and
covered
with
mud
he
now
felt
cold
and
clammy
and
began
to
have
an
idea
that
he
should
not
be
seated
there
in
that
room
in
such
a
guise
clara
too
had
instinctively
learned
from
his
face
and
tone
and
general
bearing
that
something
truly
was
the
matter
at
other
times
when
he
had
been
there
since
that
day
on
which
he
had
been
accepted
he
had
been
completely
master
of
himself
perhaps
it
had
almost
been
deemed
a
fault
in
him
that
he
had
had
none
of
the
timidity
or
hesitation
of
a
lover
he
had
seemed
to
feel
no
doubt
that
he
with
his
fortune
and
position
at
his
back
need
feel
no
scruple
in
accepting
as
his
own
the
fair
hand
for
which
he
had
asked
but
now
nothing
could
be
more
different
from
this
than
his
manner
was
now
lady
desmond
was
now
surprised
though
probably
not
as
yet
frightened
why
should
a
lawyer
have
come
from
london
to
visit
sir
thomas
at
a
period
of
such
illness
and
why
should
herbert
have
walked
over
to
desmond
court
to
tell
them
of
this
illness
there
must
be
something
in
this
lawyer
coming
which
was
intended
to
bear
in
some
way
on
her
daughter
marriage
but
herbert
she
said
you
are
quite
wet
will
you
not
put
on
some
of
patrick
things
no
thank
you
said
he
i
shall
not
stay
long
i
shall
soon
have
said
what
i
have
got
to
say
but
do
herbert
said
clara
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
so
uncomfortable
and
then
you
will
not
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
go
back
ill
as
my
father
is
said
he
i
can
not
stay
long
but
i
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
come
over
and
tell
you
tell
you
what
has
happened
at
castle
richmond
and
now
the
countess
was
frightened
there
was
that
in
herbert
tone
of
voice
and
the
form
of
his
countenance
which
was
enough
to
frighten
any
woman
what
had
happened
at
castle
richmond
what
could
have
happened
there
to
make
necessary
the
presence
of
a
lawyer
and
at
the
same
time
thus
to
sadden
her
future
and
clara
also
was
frightened
though
she
knew
not
why
his
manner
was
so
different
from
that
which
was
usual
he
was
so
cold
and
serious
and
that
she
could
not
but
be
unhappy
and
what
is
it
said
the
countess
herbert
then
sat
for
a
few
minutes
silent
thinking
how
best
he
should
tell
them
his
story
he
had
been
all
the
morning
resolving
to
tell
it
but
he
had
in
nowise
as
yet
fixed
upon
any
method
it
was
all
so
terribly
tragic
so
frightful
in
the
extent
of
its
reality
that
he
hardly
knew
how
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
get
through
his
task
i
hope
that
no
misfortune
has
come
upon
any
of
the
family
said
lady
desmond
now
beginning
to
think
that
there
might
be
misfortunes
which
would
affect
her
own
daughter
more
nearly
than
the
illness
either
of
the
baronet
or
of
his
wife
oh
i
hope
not
said
clara
getting
up
and
clasping
her
hands
what
is
it
herbert
why
do
you
speak
and
coming
round
to
him
she
took
hold
of
his
arm
dearest
clara
he
said
looking
at
her
with
more
tenderness
than
had
ever
been
usual
with
him
i
think
that
you
had
better
leave
us
i
could
tell
it
better
to
your
mother
alone
do
clara
love
go
dearest
and
we
will
call
you
clara
moved
away
very
slowly
towards
the
door
and
then
she
turned
round
if
it
is
anything
that
makes
you
unhappy
herbert
she
said
i
must
know
it
before
you
leave
me
yes
yes
either
i
or
your
mother
you
shall
be
told
certainly
yes
yes
you
shall
be
told
said
the
countess
and
now
go
my
darling
thus
dismissed
clara
did
go
and
betook
herself
to
her
own
chamber
had
owen
had
sorrows
to
tell
her
he
would
have
told
them
to
herself
of
that
she
was
quite
sure
and
now
herbert
for
sake
what
is
it
said
the
countess
pale
with
terror
she
was
fully
certain
now
that
something
was
to
be
spoken
which
would
be
calculated
to
interfere
with
her
daughter
prospects
we
all
know
the
story
which
herbert
had
to
tell
and
we
need
not
therefore
again
be
present
at
the
telling
of
it
sitting
there
wet
through
in
lady
desmond
he
did
contrive
to
utter
it
all
the
whole
of
it
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
making
it
clearly
to
be
understood
that
he
was
no
longer
fitzgerald
of
castle
richmond
but
a
nameless
pennyless
outcast
without
the
hope
of
portion
or
position
doomed
from
henceforth
to
earn
his
bread
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow
if
only
he
could
be
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
means
of
earning
it
nor
did
lady
desmond
once
interrupt
him
in
his
story
she
sat
perfectly
still
listening
to
him
almost
with
unmoved
face
she
was
too
wise
to
let
him
know
what
the
instant
working
of
her
mind
might
be
before
she
had
made
her
own
fixed
resolve
and
she
had
conceived
the
truth
much
before
he
had
completed
the
telling
of
it
we
generally
use
three
times
the
number
of
words
which
are
necessary
for
the
purpose
which
we
have
in
hand
but
had
he
used
six
times
the
number
she
would
not
have
interrupted
him
it
was
good
in
him
to
give
her
this
time
to
determine
in
what
tone
and
with
what
words
she
would
speak
when
speaking
on
her
part
should
become
absolutely
necessary
and
now
he
concluded
by
saying
and
at
this
time
he
was
standing
up
on
the
rug
you
know
it
all
lady
desmond
it
will
perhaps
be
best
that
clara
should
learn
it
from
you
he
had
said
not
a
word
of
giving
up
his
pretensions
to
lady
hand
but
then
neither
had
he
in
any
way
hinted
that
the
match
should
in
his
opinion
be
regarded
as
unbroken
he
had
not
spoken
of
his
sorrow
at
bringing
down
all
this
poverty
on
his
wife
and
surely
he
would
have
so
spoken
had
he
thought
their
engagement
was
still
valid
but
then
he
had
not
himself
pointed
out
that
the
engagement
must
necessarily
be
broken
as
in
lady
desmond
opinion
he
certainly
should
have
done
yes
said
she
in
a
cold
low
meaningless
voice
in
a
voice
that
told
nothing
by
its
tones
lady
clara
had
better
hear
it
from
me
but
in
the
title
which
she
gave
her
daughter
herbert
instantly
read
his
doom
he
however
remained
silent
it
was
for
the
countess
now
to
speak
but
it
is
possible
it
may
not
be
true
she
said
speaking
almost
in
a
whisper
looking
not
into
his
face
but
by
him
at
the
fire
it
is
possible
but
so
barely
possible
that
i
did
not
think
it
right
to
keep
the
matter
from
you
any
longer
it
would
have
been
very
wrong
very
wicked
i
may
say
said
the
countess
it
is
only
two
days
since
i
knew
anything
of
it
myself
said
he
vindicating
himself
you
were
of
course
bound
to
let
me
know
immediately
she
said
harshly
and
i
have
let
you
know
immediately
lady
desmond
and
then
they
were
both
again
silent
for
a
while
and
prendergast
thinks
there
is
no
doubt
she
asked
none
said
herbert
very
decidedly
and
he
has
told
your
cousin
owen
he
did
so
yesterday
and
by
this
time
my
poor
mother
knows
it
also
and
then
there
was
another
period
of
silence
during
the
whole
time
lady
desmond
had
uttered
no
one
word
of
condolence
not
a
syllable
of
commiseration
for
all
the
sufferings
that
had
come
upon
herbert
and
his
family
and
he
was
beginning
to
hate
her
for
her
harshness
the
tenor
of
her
countenance
had
become
hard
and
she
received
all
his
words
as
a
judge
might
have
taken
them
merely
wanting
evidence
before
he
pronounced
his
verdict
the
evidence
she
was
beginning
to
think
sufficient
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
her
verdict
after
what
she
had
heard
a
match
between
herbert
fitzgerald
and
her
daughter
would
be
out
of
the
question
it
is
very
dreadful
she
said
thinking
only
of
her
own
child
and
absolutely
shivering
at
the
danger
which
had
been
incurred
it
is
very
dreadful
said
herbert
shivering
also
it
was
almost
incredible
to
him
that
his
great
sorrow
should
be
received
in
such
a
way
by
one
who
had
professed
to
be
so
dear
a
friend
to
him
and
what
do
you
propose
to
do
mr
fitzgerald
said
the
countess
what
do
i
propose
he
said
repeating
her
words
hitherto
i
have
had
neither
time
nor
heart
to
propose
anything
such
a
misfortune
as
that
which
i
have
told
you
does
not
break
upon
a
man
without
disturbing
for
a
while
his
power
of
resolving
i
have
thought
so
much
of
my
mother
and
of
clara
since
prendergast
told
me
all
this
that
that
that
and
then
a
slight
gurgling
struggle
fell
upon
his
throat
and
hindered
him
from
speaking
he
did
not
quite
sob
out
and
he
determined
that
he
would
not
do
so
if
she
could
be
so
harsh
and
strong
he
would
be
harsh
and
strong
also
and
again
lady
desmond
sat
silent
still
thinking
how
she
had
better
speak
and
act
after
all
she
was
not
so
cruel
nor
so
bad
as
herbert
fitzgerald
thought
her
what
had
the
fitzgeralds
done
for
her
that
she
should
sorrow
for
their
sorrows
she
had
lived
there
in
that
old
ugly
barrack
long
desolate
full
of
dreary
wretchedness
and
poverty
and
lady
fitzgerald
in
her
prosperity
had
never
come
to
her
to
soften
the
hardness
of
her
life
she
had
come
over
to
ireland
a
countess
and
a
countess
she
had
been
proud
enough
at
first
in
her
little
glory
too
proud
no
doubt
and
proud
enough
afterwards
in
her
loneliness
and
poverty
and
there
she
had
lived
alone
whether
the
fault
had
been
her
own
or
no
she
owed
little
to
the
kindness
of
any
one
for
no
one
had
done
aught
to
relieve
her
bitterness
and
then
her
weak
puny
child
had
grown
up
in
the
same
shade
and
was
now
a
lovely
woman
gifted
with
high
birth
and
that
special
priceless
beauty
which
high
blood
so
often
gives
there
was
a
prize
now
within
the
walls
of
that
old
barrack
something
to
be
won
something
for
which
a
man
would
strive
and
a
mother
smile
that
her
son
might
win
it
and
now
lady
fitzgerald
had
come
to
her
she
had
never
complained
of
this
she
said
to
herself
the
bargain
between
clara
desmond
and
herbert
fitzgerald
had
been
good
for
both
of
them
and
let
it
be
made
and
settled
as
a
bargain
young
herbert
fitzgerald
had
money
and
position
her
daughter
had
beauty
and
high
blood
let
it
be
a
bargain
but
in
all
this
there
was
nothing
to
make
her
love
that
rich
prosperous
family
at
castle
richmond
there
are
those
whose
nature
it
is
to
love
friends
at
a
few
hours
warning
but
the
countess
of
desmond
was
not
one
of
them
the
bargain
had
been
made
and
her
daughter
would
have
been
able
to
perform
her
part
of
it
she
was
still
able
to
give
that
which
she
had
stipulated
to
give
but
herbert
fitzgerald
was
now
a
bankrupt
and
could
give
nothing
would
it
not
have
been
madness
to
suppose
that
the
bargain
should
still
hold
good
one
person
and
one
only
had
come
to
her
at
desmond
court
whose
coming
had
been
a
solace
to
her
weariness
of
all
those
among
whom
she
had
lived
in
cold
desolateness
for
so
many
years
one
only
had
got
near
her
heart
there
had
been
but
one
irish
voice
that
she
had
cared
to
hear
and
the
owner
of
that
voice
had
loved
her
child
instead
of
loving
her
and
she
had
borne
that
wretchedness
too
if
not
well
at
least
bravely
true
she
had
separated
that
lover
from
her
daughter
but
the
circumstances
of
both
had
made
it
right
for
her
as
a
mother
to
do
so
what
mother
circumstanced
as
she
had
been
would
have
given
her
girl
to
owen
fitzgerald
so
she
had
banished
from
the
house
the
only
voice
that
sounded
sweetly
in
her
ears
and
again
she
had
been
alone
and
then
perhaps
thoughts
had
come
to
her
when
herbert
fitzgerald
was
frequent
about
the
place
a
rich
and
thriving
wooer
that
owen
might
come
again
to
desmond
court
when
clara
had
gone
to
castle
richmond
years
were
stealing
over
her
ah
yes
she
knew
that
full
well
all
her
youth
and
the
pride
of
her
days
she
had
given
up
for
that
which
she
now
wore
so
gloomily
given
up
for
pieces
of
gold
which
had
turned
to
stone
and
slate
and
dirt
within
her
grasp
years
alas
were
fast
stealing
over
her
but
nevertheless
she
had
something
to
give
her
woman
beauty
was
not
all
faded
and
she
had
a
heart
which
was
as
yet
virgin
which
had
hitherto
loved
no
other
man
might
not
that
suffice
to
cover
a
few
years
seeing
that
in
return
she
wanted
nothing
but
love
and
so
she
had
thought
lingering
over
her
hopes
while
herbert
was
there
at
his
wooing
it
may
be
imagined
with
what
feelings
at
her
heart
she
had
seen
and
listened
to
the
frantic
attempt
made
by
owen
to
get
back
his
childish
love
but
that
too
she
had
borne
bravely
if
not
well
it
had
not
angered
her
that
her
child
was
loved
by
the
only
man
she
had
ever
loved
herself
she
had
stroked
her
daughter
hair
that
day
and
kissed
her
cheek
and
bade
her
be
happy
with
her
better
richer
lover
and
had
she
not
been
right
in
this
nor
had
she
been
angry
even
with
owen
she
could
forgive
him
all
because
she
loved
him
but
might
there
not
even
yet
be
a
chance
for
her
when
clara
should
in
very
truth
have
gone
to
castle
richmond
but
now
how
was
she
to
think
about
all
this
now
and
thinking
of
these
things
how
was
it
possible
that
she
should
have
heart
left
to
feel
for
the
miseries
of
lady
fitzgerald
with
all
her
miseries
would
not
lady
fitzgerald
still
be
more
fortunate
than
she
let
come
what
might
lady
fitzgerald
had
had
a
life
of
prosperity
and
love
no
she
could
not
think
of
lady
fitzgerald
nor
of
herbert
she
could
only
think
of
owen
fitzgerald
of
her
daughter
and
of
herself
he
owen
was
now
the
heir
to
castle
richmond
and
would
as
far
as
she
could
learn
soon
become
the
actual
possessor
he
who
had
been
cast
forth
from
desmond
court
as
too
poor
and
contemptible
in
the
world
eye
to
be
her
daughter
suitor
would
become
the
rich
inheritor
of
all
those
broad
acres
and
that
old
coveted
family
honour
and
this
owen
still
loved
her
daughter
loved
her
not
as
herbert
did
with
a
quiet
attachment
but
with
the
old
true
passionate
love
of
which
she
had
read
in
books
and
dreamed
herself
before
she
had
sold
herself
to
be
a
countess
that
owen
did
so
love
her
daughter
she
was
very
sure
and
then
as
to
her
daughter
that
she
did
not
still
love
this
new
heir
in
her
heart
of
hearts
of
that
the
mother
was
by
no
means
sure
that
her
child
had
chosen
the
better
part
in
choosing
money
and
a
title
she
had
not
doubted
and
that
having
so
chosen
clara
would
be
happy
of
that
also
she
did
not
doubt
clara
was
young
she
would
say
and
her
heart
in
a
few
months
would
follow
her
hand
but
now
how
was
she
to
decide
sitting
there
with
herbert
fitzgerald
before
her
gloomy
as
death
cold
shivering
and
muddy
telling
of
his
own
disasters
with
no
more
courage
than
a
whipped
dog
as
she
looked
at
him
she
declared
to
herself
twenty
times
in
half
a
second
that
he
had
not
about
him
a
tithe
of
the
manhood
of
his
cousin
owen
women
love
a
bold
front
and
a
voice
that
will
never
own
its
master
to
have
been
beaten
in
the
world
fight
had
owen
came
there
with
such
a
story
he
would
have
claimed
his
right
boldly
to
the
hand
in
spite
of
all
that
the
world
had
done
to
him
let
her
have
him
said
lady
desmond
to
herself
and
the
struggle
within
her
bosom
was
made
and
over
no
wonder
that
herbert
looking
into
her
face
for
pity
should
find
that
she
was
harsh
and
cruel
she
had
been
sacrificing
herself
and
had
completed
the
sacrifice
owen
fitzgerald
the
heir
to
castle
richmond
sir
owen
as
he
would
soon
be
should
have
her
daughter
they
two
at
any
rate
should
be
happy
and
she
she
would
live
there
at
desmond
court
lonely
as
she
had
ever
lived
while
all
this
was
passing
through
her
mind
she
hardly
thought
of
herbert
and
his
sorrows
that
he
must
be
given
up
and
abandoned
and
left
to
make
what
best
fight
he
could
by
himself
as
to
that
how
was
it
possible
that
she
as
a
mother
should
have
any
doubt
and
yet
it
was
a
pity
a
thousand
pities
herbert
fitzgerald
with
his
domestic
virtues
his
industry
and
thorough
respectability
would
so
exactly
have
suited
clara
taste
and
mode
of
life
had
he
only
continued
to
be
the
heir
of
castle
richmond
she
and
owen
would
not
enter
upon
the
world
together
with
nearly
the
same
fair
chance
of
happiness
who
could
prophecy
to
what
owen
might
be
led
with
his
passionate
impulses
his
strong
will
his
unbridled
temper
and
his
love
of
pleasure
that
he
was
affectionate
brave
and
tender
in
his
inmost
spirit
lady
desmond
was
very
sure
but
were
such
the
qualities
which
would
make
her
daughter
happy
when
clara
should
come
to
know
her
future
lord
as
clara
mother
knew
him
would
clara
love
him
and
worship
him
as
her
mother
did
the
mother
believed
that
clara
had
not
in
her
bosom
heart
enough
for
such
a
love
but
then
as
i
have
said
before
the
mother
did
not
know
the
daughter
you
say
that
you
will
break
all
this
to
clara
said
herbert
having
during
this
silence
turned
over
some
of
his
thoughts
also
in
his
mind
if
so
i
may
as
well
leave
you
now
you
can
imagine
that
i
am
anxious
to
get
back
to
my
mother
yes
it
will
be
better
that
i
should
tell
her
it
is
very
sad
very
sad
very
sad
indeed
yes
it
is
a
hard
load
for
a
man
to
bear
he
answered
speaking
very
very
slowly
but
for
myself
i
think
i
can
bear
it
if
if
what
asked
the
countess
if
clara
can
bear
it
and
now
it
was
necessary
that
lady
desmond
should
speak
out
she
did
not
mean
to
be
unnecessarily
harsh
but
she
did
mean
to
be
decided
and
as
she
spoke
her
face
became
stern
and
that
clara
will
be
terribly
distressed
she
said
terribly
terribly
distressed
repeating
her
words
with
great
emphasis
of
that
i
am
quite
sure
she
is
very
young
and
will
i
hope
in
time
get
over
it
and
then
too
i
think
she
is
one
whose
feelings
young
as
she
is
have
never
conquered
her
judgment
therefore
i
do
believe
that
with
mercy
she
will
be
able
to
bear
it
but
fitzgerald
well
of
course
you
feel
with
me
and
i
am
sure
that
with
your
excellent
judgment
it
is
a
thing
of
course
that
everything
must
be
over
between
you
and
lady
clara
and
then
she
came
to
a
full
stop
as
though
all
had
been
said
that
could
be
considered
necessary
herbert
did
not
answer
at
once
but
stood
there
shivering
and
shaking
in
his
misery
he
was
all
but
overcome
by
the
chill
of
his
wet
garments
and
though
he
struggled
to
throw
off
the
dead
feeling
of
utter
cold
which
struck
him
to
the
heart
he
was
quite
unable
to
master
it
he
could
hardly
forgive
himself
that
on
such
an
occasion
he
should
have
been
so
conquered
by
his
own
outer
feelings
but
now
he
could
not
help
himself
he
was
weak
with
hunger
too
though
he
did
not
know
it
for
he
had
hardly
eaten
food
that
day
and
was
nearly
exhausted
with
the
unaccustomed
amount
of
hard
exercise
which
he
had
taken
he
was
moreover
thoroughly
wet
through
and
heavy
laden
with
the
mud
of
the
road
it
was
no
wonder
that
lady
desmond
had
said
to
herself
that
he
looked
like
a
whipped
dog
that
must
be
as
lady
clara
shall
decide
he
said
at
last
barely
uttering
the
words
through
his
chattering
teeth
it
must
be
as
i
say
said
the
countess
firmly
whether
by
her
decision
or
by
yours
or
if
necessary
by
mine
but
if
your
feelings
are
as
i
take
them
to
be
those
of
a
man
of
honour
you
will
not
leave
it
to
me
or
to
her
what
now
that
you
have
the
world
to
struggle
with
would
you
seek
to
drag
her
down
into
the
struggle
our
union
was
to
be
for
better
or
worse
i
would
have
given
her
all
the
better
and
yes
and
had
there
been
a
union
she
would
have
bravely
borne
her
part
in
sharing
the
worst
but
who
ought
to
be
so
thankful
as
you
that
this
truth
has
broken
upon
you
before
you
had
clogged
yourself
with
a
wife
of
high
birth
but
without
fortune
alone
a
man
educated
as
you
are
with
your
talents
may
face
the
world
without
fearing
anything
but
how
could
you
make
your
way
now
if
my
daughter
were
your
wife
when
you
think
of
it
fitzgerald
you
will
cease
to
wish
for
it
never
i
have
given
my
heart
to
your
daughter
and
i
can
not
take
back
the
gift
she
has
accepted
it
and
she
can
not
return
it
and
what
would
you
have
her
do
lady
desmond
asked
with
anger
and
almost
passion
in
her
voice
wait
as
i
must
wait
said
herbert
that
will
be
her
duty
as
i
believe
it
will
also
be
her
wish
yes
and
wear
out
her
young
heart
here
in
solitude
for
the
next
ten
years
and
then
learn
when
her
beauty
and
her
youth
are
gone
but
no
fitzgerald
i
will
not
allow
myself
to
contemplate
such
a
prospect
either
for
her
or
for
you
under
the
lamentable
circumstances
which
you
have
now
told
me
it
is
imperative
that
this
match
should
be
broken
off
ask
your
own
mother
and
hear
what
she
will
say
and
if
you
are
a
man
you
will
not
throw
upon
my
poor
child
the
hard
task
of
declaring
that
it
must
be
so
you
by
your
calamity
are
unable
to
perform
your
contract
with
her
and
it
is
for
you
to
announce
that
that
contract
is
therefore
over
herbert
in
his
present
state
was
unable
to
argue
with
lady
desmond
he
had
in
his
brain
and
mind
and
heart
and
soul
at
least
so
he
said
to
himself
afterwards
having
perhaps
but
a
loose
idea
of
the
different
functions
of
these
four
different
properties
a
thorough
conviction
that
as
he
and
clara
had
sworn
to
each
other
that
for
life
they
would
live
together
and
love
each
other
no
misfortune
to
either
of
them
could
justify
the
other
in
breaking
that
oath
could
even
justify
him
in
breaking
it
though
he
was
the
one
on
whom
misfortune
had
fallen
he
no
doubt
had
first
loved
clara
for
her
beauty
but
would
he
have
ceased
to
love
her
or
have
cast
her
from
him
if
by
god
will
her
beauty
had
perished
and
gone
from
her
would
he
not
have
held
her
closer
to
his
heart
and
told
her
with
strong
comforting
vows
that
his
love
had
now
gone
deeper
than
that
that
they
were
already
of
the
same
bone
of
the
same
flesh
of
the
same
family
and
hearthstone
he
knew
himself
in
this
and
knew
that
he
would
have
been
proud
so
to
do
and
so
to
feel
that
he
would
have
cast
from
him
with
utter
indignation
any
who
would
have
counselled
him
to
do
or
to
feel
differently
and
why
should
clara
heart
be
different
from
his
all
this
i
say
was
his
strong
conviction
but
nevertheless
her
heart
might
be
different
she
might
look
on
that
engagement
of
theirs
with
altogether
other
thoughts
and
other
ideas
and
if
so
his
voice
should
never
reproach
her
not
his
voice
however
his
heart
might
do
so
such
might
be
the
case
with
her
but
he
did
not
think
it
and
therefore
he
would
not
pronounce
that
decision
which
clara
mother
expected
from
him
when
you
have
told
her
of
this
i
suppose
i
may
be
allowed
to
see
her
he
said
avoiding
the
direct
proposition
which
lady
desmond
had
made
to
him
allowed
to
see
her
said
lady
desmond
now
also
in
her
turn
speaking
very
slowly
i
can
not
answer
that
question
as
yet
not
quite
immediately
i
should
say
but
if
you
will
leave
the
matter
in
my
hands
i
will
write
to
you
if
not
then
the
next
day
i
would
sooner
that
she
should
write
i
can
not
promise
that
i
do
not
know
how
far
her
good
sense
and
strength
may
support
her
under
this
affliction
that
she
will
suffer
terribly
on
your
account
as
well
as
on
her
own
you
may
be
quite
sure
and
then
again
there
was
a
pause
of
some
moments
i
at
any
rate
shall
write
to
her
he
then
said
and
shall
tell
her
that
i
expect
her
to
see
me
her
will
in
this
matter
shall
be
my
will
if
she
thinks
that
her
misery
will
be
greater
in
being
engaged
to
a
poor
man
than
than
in
relinquishing
her
love
she
shall
hear
no
word
from
me
to
overpersuade
her
but
lady
desmond
i
will
say
nothing
that
shall
authorize
her
to
think
that
she
is
given
up
by
me
till
i
have
in
some
way
learned
from
herself
what
her
own
feelings
are
and
now
i
will
say
to
you
said
the
countess
thinking
that
it
might
be
as
well
that
the
interview
should
be
ended
but
fitzgerald
you
are
very
wet
and
i
fear
that
you
are
very
cold
you
had
better
take
something
before
you
go
countess
as
she
was
she
had
no
carriage
in
which
she
could
send
him
home
no
horse
even
on
which
he
could
ride
nothing
thank
you
lady
desmond
he
said
and
so
without
offering
her
the
courtesy
of
his
hand
he
walked
out
of
the
room
he
was
very
angry
with
her
as
he
tried
to
make
the
blood
run
quicker
in
his
veins
by
hurrying
down
the
avenue
into
the
road
at
his
quickest
pace
so
angry
with
her
that
for
a
while
in
his
indignation
he
almost
forgot
his
father
and
his
mother
and
his
own
family
tragedy
that
she
should
have
wished
to
save
her
daughter
from
such
a
marriage
might
have
been
natural
but
that
she
should
have
treated
him
so
coldly
so
harshly
without
one
spark
of
love
or
pity
him
who
to
her
had
been
so
loyal
during
his
courtship
of
her
daughter
it
was
almost
incredible
to
him
was
not
his
story
one
that
would
have
melted
the
heart
of
a
stranger
at
which
men
would
weep
he
himself
had
seen
tears
in
the
eyes
of
that
dry
london
lawyer
as
the
full
depth
of
the
calamity
had
forced
itself
upon
his
heart
yes
prendergast
had
not
been
able
to
repress
his
tears
when
he
told
the
tale
but
lady
desmond
had
shed
no
tears
when
the
tale
had
been
told
to
her
no
soft
woman
message
had
been
sent
to
the
afflicted
mother
on
whom
it
had
pleased
god
to
allow
so
heavy
a
hand
to
fall
no
word
of
tenderness
had
been
uttered
for
the
sinking
father
there
had
been
no
feeling
for
the
household
which
was
to
have
been
so
nearly
linked
with
her
own
no
looking
round
with
greedy
eyes
for
wealth
for
her
daughter
lady
desmond
had
found
a
match
that
suited
her
now
that
match
no
longer
suited
her
greed
and
she
could
throw
from
her
without
a
struggle
to
her
feelings
the
suitor
that
was
now
poor
and
the
family
of
the
suitor
that
was
now
neither
grand
nor
powerful
and
then
too
he
felt
angry
with
clara
though
he
knew
that
as
yet
at
any
rate
he
had
no
cause
in
spite
of
what
he
had
said
and
felt
he
would
imagine
to
himself
that
she
also
would
be
cold
and
untrue
let
her
go
he
said
to
himself
love
is
worth
nothing
nothing
if
it
does
not
believe
itself
to
be
of
more
worth
than
everything
beside
if
she
does
not
love
me
now
in
my
misery
if
she
would
not
choose
me
now
for
her
husband
her
love
has
never
been
worthy
the
name
love
that
has
no
faith
in
itself
that
does
not
value
itself
above
all
worldly
things
is
nothing
if
it
be
not
so
with
her
let
her
go
back
to
him
it
may
easily
be
understood
who
was
the
him
and
then
herbert
walked
on
so
rapidly
that
at
length
his
strength
almost
failed
him
and
in
his
exhaustion
he
had
more
than
once
to
lean
against
a
gate
on
the
with
difficulty
at
last
he
got
home
and
dragged
himself
up
the
long
avenue
to
the
front
door
even
yet
he
was
not
warm
through
to
his
heart
and
he
felt
as
he
entered
the
house
that
he
was
quite
unfitted
for
the
work
which
he
might
yet
have
to
do
before
he
could
go
to
his
bed
chapter
xxvii
comforted
when
herbert
fitzgerald
got
back
to
castle
richmond
it
was
nearly
dark
he
opened
the
hall
door
without
ringing
the
bell
and
walking
at
once
into
the
threw
himself
into
a
large
leathern
chair
which
always
stood
near
the
there
was
a
bright
fire
burning
on
the
hearth
and
he
drew
himself
close
to
it
putting
his
wet
feet
up
on
to
the
fender
thinking
that
he
would
at
any
rate
warm
himself
before
he
went
in
among
any
of
the
family
the
room
with
its
deep
red
curtains
and
paper
was
almost
dark
and
he
knew
that
he
might
remain
there
unseen
and
unnoticed
for
the
next
half
hour
if
he
could
only
get
a
glass
of
wine
he
tried
the
cellaret
which
was
as
often
open
as
locked
but
now
unfortunately
it
was
closed
in
such
a
case
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
the
butler
had
the
key
or
aunt
letty
so
he
sat
himself
down
without
that
luxury
by
this
time
as
he
well
knew
all
would
have
been
told
to
his
mother
and
his
first
duty
would
be
to
go
to
her
to
go
to
her
and
comfort
her
if
comfort
might
be
possible
by
telling
her
that
he
could
bear
it
all
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
title
and
wealth
and
a
proud
name
were
as
nothing
to
him
in
comparison
with
his
mother
love
in
whatever
guise
he
may
have
appeared
before
lady
desmond
he
would
not
go
to
his
mother
with
a
fainting
heart
she
should
not
hear
his
teeth
chatter
nor
see
his
limbs
shake
so
he
sat
himself
down
there
that
he
might
become
warm
and
in
five
minutes
he
was
fast
asleep
how
long
he
slept
he
did
not
know
not
very
long
probably
but
when
he
awoke
it
was
quite
dark
he
gazed
at
the
fire
for
a
moment
bethought
himself
of
where
he
was
and
why
shook
himself
to
get
rid
of
his
slumber
and
then
roused
himself
in
his
chair
as
he
did
so
a
soft
sweet
voice
close
to
his
shoulder
spoke
to
him
herbert
it
said
are
you
awake
and
he
found
that
his
mother
seated
by
his
side
on
a
low
stool
had
been
watching
him
in
his
sleep
mother
he
exclaimed
herbert
my
child
my
son
and
the
mother
and
son
were
fast
locked
in
each
other
arms
he
had
sat
down
there
thinking
how
he
would
go
to
his
mother
and
offer
her
solace
in
her
sorrow
how
he
would
bid
her
be
of
good
cheer
and
encourage
her
to
bear
the
world
as
the
world
had
now
fallen
to
her
lot
he
had
pictured
to
himself
that
he
would
find
her
sinking
in
despair
and
had
promised
himself
that
with
his
vows
his
kisses
and
his
prayers
he
would
bring
her
back
to
her
and
induce
her
to
acknowledge
that
god
mercy
was
yet
good
to
her
but
now
on
awakening
he
discovered
that
she
had
been
tending
him
in
his
misery
and
watching
him
while
he
slept
that
she
might
comfort
him
with
her
caresses
the
moment
that
he
awoke
to
the
remembrance
of
his
misfortunes
herbert
herbert
my
son
my
son
she
said
again
as
she
pressed
him
close
in
her
arms
mother
has
he
told
you
yes
she
had
learned
it
all
but
hardly
more
than
she
had
known
before
or
at
any
rate
not
more
than
she
had
expected
as
she
now
told
him
for
many
days
past
she
had
felt
that
this
trouble
which
had
fallen
upon
his
father
must
have
come
from
the
circumstances
of
their
marriage
and
she
would
have
spoken
out
she
said
when
the
idea
became
clear
to
her
had
she
not
then
been
told
that
prendergast
had
been
invited
to
come
thither
from
london
then
she
knew
that
she
had
better
remain
silent
at
any
rate
till
his
visit
had
been
made
and
herbert
again
sat
in
the
chair
and
his
mother
crouched
or
almost
kneeled
on
the
cushion
at
his
knee
dearest
dearest
dearest
mother
he
said
as
he
supported
her
head
against
his
shoulder
we
must
love
each
other
now
more
than
ever
we
have
loved
and
you
forgive
us
herbert
for
all
that
we
have
done
to
you
mother
if
you
speak
in
that
way
to
me
you
will
kill
me
my
darling
darling
mother
there
was
but
little
more
said
between
them
upon
the
matter
but
little
more
at
least
in
words
but
there
was
an
infinity
of
caresses
and
deep
deep
assurances
of
undying
love
and
confidence
and
then
she
asked
him
about
his
bride
and
he
told
her
where
he
had
been
and
what
had
happened
you
must
not
claim
her
herbert
she
said
to
him
god
is
good
and
will
teach
you
to
bear
even
that
also
must
i
not
he
asked
with
a
sadly
plaintive
voice
no
my
child
you
invited
her
to
share
your
prosperity
and
would
it
be
just
but
mother
if
she
wills
it
it
is
for
you
to
give
her
back
her
troth
then
leave
it
to
time
and
her
own
heart
but
if
she
love
me
mother
she
will
not
take
back
her
troth
would
i
take
back
hers
because
she
was
in
sorrow
men
and
women
herbert
are
different
the
oak
cares
not
whether
the
creeper
which
hangs
to
it
be
weak
or
strong
if
it
be
weak
the
oak
can
give
it
strength
but
the
staff
which
has
to
support
the
creeper
must
needs
have
strength
of
its
own
he
made
no
further
answer
to
her
but
understood
that
he
must
do
as
she
bade
him
he
understood
now
also
without
many
arguments
within
himself
that
he
had
no
right
to
expect
from
clara
desmond
that
adherence
to
him
and
his
misfortunes
which
he
would
have
owed
to
her
had
she
been
unfortunate
he
understood
this
now
but
still
he
hoped
two
hearts
that
have
once
become
as
one
can
not
be
separated
he
said
to
himself
that
night
as
he
resolved
that
it
was
his
duty
to
write
to
her
unconditionally
returning
to
her
her
pledges
but
herbert
what
a
state
you
are
in
said
lady
fitzgerald
as
the
flame
of
the
coal
glimmering
out
threw
a
faint
light
upon
his
clothes
yes
mother
i
have
been
walking
and
you
are
wet
i
am
nearly
dry
now
i
was
wet
but
mother
i
am
tired
and
fagged
it
would
do
me
good
if
i
could
get
a
glass
of
wine
she
rang
the
bell
and
gave
her
orders
calmly
though
every
servant
in
the
house
now
knew
the
whole
truth
and
then
lit
a
candle
herself
and
looked
at
him
my
child
what
have
you
done
to
yourself
oh
herbert
you
will
be
ill
and
then
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
she
took
him
up
to
her
own
room
and
sat
by
him
while
he
took
off
his
muddy
boots
and
clammy
socks
and
made
him
hot
drinks
and
tended
him
as
she
had
done
when
he
was
a
child
and
yet
she
had
that
day
heard
of
her
great
ruin
with
truth
indeed
had
prendergast
said
that
she
was
made
of
more
enduring
material
than
sir
thomas
and
she
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
go
to
his
bed
but
in
this
he
would
not
listen
to
her
he
must
he
said
see
his
father
that
night
you
have
been
with
him
mother
since
since
oh
yes
directly
after
prendergast
left
me
well
he
cried
like
a
child
herbert
we
both
sobbed
together
like
two
children
it
was
very
piteous
but
i
think
i
left
him
better
than
he
has
been
he
knows
now
that
those
men
can
not
come
again
to
harass
him
herbert
gnashed
his
teeth
and
clenched
his
fist
as
he
thought
of
them
but
he
could
not
speak
of
them
or
mention
their
name
before
his
mother
what
must
her
thoughts
be
as
she
remembered
that
elder
man
and
looked
back
to
her
early
childhood
he
is
very
weak
she
went
on
to
say
almost
helplessly
weak
now
and
does
not
seem
to
think
of
leaving
his
bed
i
have
begged
him
to
let
me
send
to
dublin
for
sir
henry
but
he
says
that
nothing
ails
him
and
who
is
with
him
now
mother
the
girls
are
both
there
and
mr
prendergast
lady
fitzgerald
then
explained
to
him
that
prendergast
had
returned
to
dublin
that
afternoon
starting
hours
earlier
than
he
intended
or
at
any
rate
than
he
had
said
that
he
intended
having
done
his
work
there
he
had
felt
that
he
would
now
only
be
in
the
way
and
moreover
though
his
work
was
done
at
castle
richmond
other
work
in
the
same
matter
had
still
to
be
done
in
england
prendergast
had
very
little
doubt
as
to
the
truth
of
mollett
story
indeed
we
may
say
he
had
no
doubt
otherwise
he
would
hardly
have
made
it
known
to
all
that
world
round
castle
richmond
but
nevertheless
it
behoved
him
thoroughly
to
sift
the
matter
he
felt
tolerably
sure
that
he
should
find
mollett
in
london
and
whether
he
did
or
no
he
should
be
able
to
identify
or
not
to
identify
that
scoundrel
with
the
talbot
who
had
hired
chevy
chase
lodge
in
dorsetshire
and
who
had
undoubtedly
married
poor
mary
wainwright
he
left
a
kind
message
for
you
said
lady
my
readers
must
excuse
me
if
i
still
call
her
lady
fitzgerald
for
i
can
not
bring
my
pen
to
the
use
of
any
other
name
and
it
was
so
also
with
the
dependents
and
neighbours
of
castle
richmond
when
the
time
came
that
the
poor
lady
felt
that
she
was
bound
publicly
to
drop
her
title
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
drop
it
no
effort
that
she
could
make
would
induce
those
around
her
to
call
her
by
another
name
he
bade
me
say
she
continued
that
if
your
future
course
of
life
should
take
you
to
london
you
are
to
go
to
him
and
look
to
him
as
another
father
he
has
no
child
of
his
own
he
said
and
you
shall
be
to
him
as
a
son
i
will
be
no
one
son
but
yours
yours
and
my
father
he
said
again
embracing
her
and
then
when
under
his
mother
eye
he
had
eaten
and
drank
and
made
himself
warm
he
did
go
to
his
father
and
found
both
his
sisters
sitting
there
they
came
and
clustered
round
him
taking
hold
of
his
hands
and
looking
up
into
his
face
loving
him
and
pitying
him
and
caressing
him
with
their
eyes
but
standing
there
by
their
father
bed
they
said
little
or
nothing
nor
did
sir
thomas
say
much
except
this
indeed
that
just
as
herbert
was
leaving
him
he
declared
with
a
faint
voice
that
henceforth
his
son
should
be
master
of
that
house
and
the
disposer
of
that
property
as
long
as
i
live
he
exclaimed
with
his
weak
voice
as
long
as
i
live
no
father
not
so
yes
yes
as
long
as
i
live
it
will
be
little
that
you
will
have
even
so
very
little
but
so
it
shall
be
as
long
as
i
live
very
little
indeed
poor
man
for
alas
his
days
were
numbered
and
then
when
herbert
left
the
room
emmeline
followed
him
she
had
ever
been
his
dearest
sister
and
now
she
longed
to
be
with
him
that
she
might
tell
him
how
she
loved
him
and
comfort
him
with
her
tears
and
clara
too
clara
whom
she
had
welcomed
as
a
sister
she
must
learn
now
how
clara
would
behave
for
she
had
already
made
herself
sure
that
her
brother
had
been
at
desmond
court
the
herald
of
his
own
ruin
may
i
come
with
you
herbert
she
asked
closing
in
round
him
and
getting
under
his
arm
how
could
he
refuse
her
so
they
went
together
and
sat
over
a
fire
in
a
small
room
that
was
sacred
to
her
and
her
sister
and
there
with
many
sobs
on
her
part
and
much
brave
contempt
of
poverty
on
his
they
talked
over
the
altered
world
as
it
now
showed
itself
before
them
and
you
did
not
see
her
she
asked
when
with
many
efforts
she
had
brought
the
subject
round
to
clara
desmond
and
her
brother
walk
to
desmond
court
no
she
left
the
room
at
my
own
bidding
i
could
not
have
told
it
myself
to
her
and
you
can
not
know
then
what
she
would
say
no
i
can
not
know
what
she
would
say
but
i
know
now
what
i
must
say
myself
all
that
is
over
emmeline
i
can
not
ask
her
to
marry
a
beggar
ask
her
no
there
will
be
no
need
of
asking
her
she
has
already
given
you
her
promise
you
do
not
think
that
she
will
desert
you
you
do
not
wish
it
herein
were
contained
two
distinct
questions
the
latter
of
which
herbert
did
not
care
to
answer
i
shall
not
call
it
desertion
he
said
indeed
the
proposal
will
come
from
me
i
shall
write
to
her
telling
her
that
she
need
think
about
me
no
longer
only
that
i
am
so
weary
i
would
do
it
now
and
how
will
she
answer
you
if
she
is
the
clara
that
i
take
her
for
she
will
throw
your
proposal
back
into
your
face
she
will
tell
you
that
it
is
not
in
your
power
to
reject
her
now
she
will
swear
to
you
that
let
your
words
be
what
they
may
she
will
think
of
you
more
now
than
she
has
ever
thought
in
better
days
she
will
tell
you
of
her
love
in
words
that
she
could
not
use
before
i
know
she
will
i
know
that
she
is
good
and
true
and
honest
and
generous
oh
i
should
die
if
i
thought
she
were
false
but
herbert
i
am
sure
that
she
is
true
you
can
write
your
letter
and
we
shall
see
herbert
with
wise
arguments
learned
from
his
mother
reasoned
with
his
sister
explaining
to
her
that
clara
was
now
by
no
means
bound
to
cling
to
him
but
as
he
spoke
them
his
arm
fastened
itself
closely
round
his
sister
waist
for
the
words
which
she
uttered
with
so
much
energy
were
comfortable
to
him
and
then
seated
there
before
he
moved
from
the
room
he
made
her
bring
him
pens
ink
and
paper
and
he
wrote
his
letter
to
clara
desmond
she
would
fain
have
stayed
with
him
while
he
did
so
sitting
at
his
feet
and
looking
into
his
face
and
trying
to
encourage
his
hope
as
to
what
clara
answer
might
be
but
this
he
would
not
allow
so
she
went
again
to
her
father
room
having
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
promise
that
clara
answer
should
be
shown
to
her
and
the
letter
when
it
was
written
copied
and
recopied
ran
as
follows
castle
richmond
night
my
dearest
clara
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
he
could
satisfy
himself
with
that
or
indeed
with
any
other
mode
of
commencement
in
the
short
little
which
had
hitherto
gone
from
him
sent
from
house
to
house
he
had
written
to
her
with
appellations
of
endearment
of
his
own
as
all
lovers
do
and
as
all
lovers
seem
to
think
that
no
lovers
have
done
before
themselves
with
appellations
which
are
so
sweet
to
those
who
write
and
so
musical
to
those
who
read
but
which
sound
so
ludicrous
when
barbarously
made
public
in
hideous
law
courts
by
lawyers
with
mercenary
tongues
in
this
way
only
had
he
written
and
each
of
these
sweet
silly
songs
of
love
had
been
as
full
of
honey
as
words
could
make
it
but
he
had
never
yet
written
to
her
on
a
full
sheet
of
paper
a
sensible
positive
letter
containing
thoughts
and
facts
as
men
do
write
to
women
and
women
also
to
men
when
the
lollypops
and
candied
of
early
love
have
passed
away
now
he
was
to
write
his
first
serious
letter
to
her
and
probably
his
last
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
could
get
himself
over
the
first
three
words
but
there
they
were
decided
on
at
last
my
dearest
clara
before
you
get
this
your
mother
will
have
told
you
all
that
which
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
speak
out
yesterday
as
long
as
you
were
in
the
room
i
am
sure
you
will
understand
now
why
i
begged
you
to
go
away
and
will
not
think
the
worse
of
me
for
doing
so
you
now
know
the
whole
truth
and
i
am
sure
that
you
will
feel
for
us
all
here
having
thought
a
good
deal
upon
the
matter
chiefly
during
my
walk
home
from
desmond
court
and
indeed
since
i
have
been
at
home
i
have
come
to
the
resolution
that
everything
between
us
must
be
over
it
would
be
unmanly
in
me
to
wish
to
ruin
you
because
i
myself
am
ruined
our
engagement
was
of
course
made
on
the
presumption
that
i
should
inherit
my
father
estate
as
it
is
i
shall
not
do
so
and
therefore
i
beg
that
you
will
regard
that
engagement
as
at
an
end
of
my
own
love
for
you
i
will
say
nothing
but
i
know
that
you
have
loved
me
truly
and
that
all
this
therefore
will
cause
you
great
grief
it
is
better
however
that
it
should
be
so
than
that
i
should
seek
to
hold
you
to
a
promise
which
was
made
under
such
different
circumstances
you
will
of
course
show
this
letter
to
your
mother
she
at
any
rate
will
approve
of
what
i
am
now
doing
and
so
will
you
when
you
allow
yourself
to
consider
it
calmly
we
have
not
known
each
other
so
long
that
there
is
much
for
us
to
give
back
to
each
other
if
you
do
not
think
it
wrong
i
should
like
still
to
keep
that
lock
of
your
hair
to
remind
me
of
my
first
love
and
as
i
think
my
only
one
and
you
i
hope
will
not
be
afraid
to
have
near
you
the
one
little
present
that
i
made
you
and
now
dearest
clara
let
us
always
think
each
of
the
other
as
of
a
very
dear
friend
may
god
bless
you
and
preserve
you
and
make
you
happy
yours
with
sincere
affection
herbert
fitzgerald
this
when
at
last
he
had
succeeded
in
writing
it
he
read
over
and
over
again
but
on
each
occasion
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
cold
and
passionless
stilted
and
unmeaning
it
by
no
means
pleased
him
and
seemed
as
though
it
could
bring
but
one
answer
a
cold
acquiescence
in
the
proposal
which
he
so
coldly
made
but
yet
he
knew
not
how
to
improve
it
and
after
all
it
was
a
true
exposition
of
that
which
he
had
determined
to
say
all
the
world
her
world
and
his
world
would
think
it
better
that
they
should
part
and
let
the
struggle
cost
him
what
it
would
he
would
teach
himself
to
wish
that
it
might
be
so
if
not
for
his
own
sake
then
for
hers
so
he
fastened
the
letter
and
taking
it
with
him
determined
to
send
it
over
so
that
it
should
reach
clara
quite
early
on
the
following
morning
and
then
having
once
more
visited
his
father
and
once
more
kissed
his
mother
he
betook
himself
to
bed
it
had
been
with
him
one
of
those
days
which
seem
to
pass
away
without
reference
to
usual
hours
and
periods
it
had
been
long
dark
and
he
seemed
to
have
been
hanging
about
the
house
doing
nothing
and
aiding
nobody
till
he
was
weary
of
himself
so
he
went
off
to
bed
almost
wondering
as
he
bethought
himself
of
what
had
happened
to
him
within
the
last
two
days
that
he
was
able
to
bear
the
burden
of
his
life
so
easily
as
he
did
he
betook
himself
to
bed
and
with
the
letter
close
at
his
hand
so
that
he
might
despatch
it
when
he
awoke
he
was
soon
asleep
after
all
that
walk
terrible
as
it
had
been
was
in
the
end
serviceable
to
him
he
slept
without
waking
till
the
light
of
the
february
morning
was
beginning
to
dawn
into
his
room
and
then
he
was
roused
by
a
servant
knocking
at
the
door
it
was
grievous
enough
that
awaking
to
his
sorrow
after
the
pleasant
dreams
of
the
night
here
is
a
letter
herbert
from
desmond
court
said
richard
the
boy
as
brought
it
says
as
how
a
letter
from
desmond
court
said
herbert
putting
out
his
hand
greedily
yes
herbert
the
boy
been
here
this
hour
and
better
i
just
up
and
about
myself
or
i
would
have
let
keep
it
from
you
not
half
a
minute
and
where
is
he
i
have
a
letter
to
send
to
desmond
court
but
never
mind
perhaps
it
no
good
minding
for
the
gossoon
gone
back
any
ways
and
then
richard
having
drawn
the
blind
and
placed
a
little
table
by
the
left
his
young
master
to
read
the
despatch
from
desmond
court
herbert
till
he
saw
the
writing
feared
that
it
was
from
the
countess
but
the
letter
was
from
clara
she
also
had
thought
good
to
write
before
she
betook
herself
to
bed
and
she
had
been
earlier
in
despatching
her
messenger
here
is
her
letter
dear
herbert
my
own
herbert
i
have
heard
it
all
but
remember
this
nothing
nothing
can
make
any
change
between
you
and
me
i
will
hear
of
no
arguments
that
are
to
separate
us
i
know
beforehand
what
you
will
say
but
i
will
not
regard
it
not
in
the
least
i
love
you
ten
times
the
more
for
all
your
unhappiness
and
as
i
would
have
shared
your
good
fortune
i
claim
my
right
to
share
your
bad
fortune
believe
that
nothing
shall
turn
me
from
this
for
i
will
be
given
give
my
kindest
love
to
your
dear
dear
dearest
mother
my
mother
as
she
is
and
must
be
and
to
my
darling
girls
i
do
so
wish
i
could
be
with
them
and
with
you
my
own
herbert
i
can
not
help
writing
in
confusion
but
i
will
explain
all
when
i
see
you
i
have
been
so
unhappy
your
own
faithful
clara
having
read
this
herbert
fitzgerald
in
spite
of
his
affliction
was
comforted
chapter
xxviii
for
a
that
and
a
that
herbert
as
he
started
from
his
bed
with
this
letter
in
his
hand
felt
that
he
could
yet
hold
up
his
head
against
all
that
the
world
could
do
to
him
how
could
he
be
really
unhappy
while
he
possessed
such
an
assurance
of
love
as
this
and
while
his
mother
was
able
to
give
him
so
glorious
an
example
of
endurance
he
was
not
really
unhappy
the
wretchedness
of
the
preceding
day
seemed
to
have
departed
from
him
as
he
hurried
on
his
clothes
and
went
off
to
his
sister
room
that
he
might
show
his
letter
to
emmeline
in
accordance
with
the
promise
he
had
made
her
may
i
come
in
he
said
knocking
at
the
door
i
must
come
in
for
i
have
something
to
show
you
but
the
two
girls
were
dressing
and
he
could
not
be
admitted
emmeline
however
promised
to
come
to
him
and
in
about
three
minutes
she
was
out
in
the
cold
little
which
adjoined
their
with
her
slippers
on
and
her
dressing
gown
wrapped
round
her
an
object
presentable
to
no
male
eyes
but
those
of
her
brother
emmeline
said
he
i
have
got
a
letter
this
morning
not
from
clara
yes
from
clara
there
you
may
read
it
and
he
handed
her
the
precious
epistle
but
she
could
not
have
got
your
letter
said
emmeline
before
she
looked
at
the
one
in
her
hand
certainly
not
for
i
have
it
here
i
must
write
another
now
but
in
truth
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
i
can
be
as
generous
as
she
is
and
then
his
sister
read
the
letter
my
own
clara
she
exclaimed
as
she
saw
what
was
the
tenor
of
it
did
i
not
tell
you
so
herbert
i
knew
well
what
she
would
do
and
say
love
you
ten
times
better
of
course
she
does
what
honest
girl
would
not
my
own
beautiful
clara
i
knew
i
could
depend
on
her
i
did
not
doubt
her
for
one
moment
but
in
this
particular
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
miss
emmeline
fitzgerald
hardly
confined
herself
to
the
strictest
veracity
for
she
had
lain
awake
half
the
night
perplexed
with
doubt
what
oh
what
if
clara
should
be
untrue
such
had
been
the
burden
of
her
doubting
midnight
thoughts
will
not
be
given
up
she
continued
quoting
the
letter
no
of
course
not
and
i
tell
you
what
herbert
you
must
not
dare
to
talk
of
giving
her
up
money
and
titles
may
be
tossed
to
and
fro
but
not
hearts
how
beautifully
she
speaks
of
dear
mamma
and
now
the
tears
began
to
run
down
the
young
lady
cheeks
oh
i
do
wish
she
could
be
with
us
my
darling
darling
darling
clara
unhappy
yes
i
am
sure
lady
desmond
will
give
her
no
peace
but
never
mind
she
will
be
true
through
it
all
and
i
said
so
from
the
first
and
then
she
fell
to
crying
and
embracing
her
brother
and
declaring
that
nothing
now
should
make
her
altogether
unhappy
but
emmeline
you
must
not
think
that
i
shall
take
her
at
her
word
it
is
very
generous
of
her
nonsense
herbert
and
then
there
was
another
torrent
of
eloquence
in
answering
which
herbert
found
that
his
arguments
were
of
very
little
efficacy
and
now
we
must
go
back
to
desmond
court
and
see
under
what
all
but
overwhelming
difficulties
poor
clara
wrote
her
affectionate
letter
and
in
the
first
place
it
should
be
pointed
out
how
very
wrong
herbert
had
been
in
going
to
desmond
court
on
foot
through
the
mud
and
rain
a
man
can
hardly
bear
himself
nobly
unless
his
outer
aspect
be
in
some
degree
noble
it
may
be
very
sad
this
having
to
admit
that
the
tailor
does
in
great
part
make
the
man
but
such
i
fear
is
undoubtedly
the
fact
could
the
chancellor
look
dignified
on
the
woolsack
if
he
had
had
an
accident
with
his
wig
or
allowed
his
robes
to
be
torn
or
soiled
does
not
half
the
piety
of
a
bishop
reside
in
his
lawn
sleeves
and
all
his
meekness
in
his
apron
had
herbert
understood
the
world
he
would
have
had
out
the
best
pair
of
horses
standing
in
the
castle
richmond
stables
when
going
to
desmond
court
on
such
an
errand
he
would
have
brushed
his
hair
and
anointed
himself
he
would
have
clothed
himself
in
his
rich
spanish
cloak
he
would
have
seen
that
his
hat
was
brushed
and
his
boots
spotless
and
then
with
all
due
solemnity
but
with
head
erect
he
would
have
told
his
tale
out
boldly
the
countess
would
still
have
wished
to
be
rid
of
him
hearing
that
he
was
a
pauper
but
she
would
have
lacked
the
courage
to
turn
him
from
the
house
as
she
had
done
but
seeing
how
wobegone
he
was
and
wretched
how
mean
to
look
at
and
low
in
his
outward
presence
she
had
been
able
to
assume
the
mastery
and
had
kept
it
throughout
the
interview
and
having
done
this
her
opinion
of
his
prowess
naturally
became
low
and
she
felt
that
he
would
have
been
unable
to
press
his
cause
against
her
for
some
time
after
he
had
departed
she
sat
alone
in
the
room
in
which
she
had
received
him
she
expected
every
minute
that
clara
would
come
down
to
her
still
wishing
however
that
she
might
be
left
for
a
while
alone
but
clara
did
not
come
and
she
was
able
to
pursue
her
thoughts
how
very
terrible
was
this
tragedy
that
had
fallen
out
in
her
close
neighbourhood
that
was
the
first
thought
that
came
to
her
now
that
herbert
had
left
her
how
terrible
overwhelming
and
fatal
what
calamity
could
fall
upon
a
woman
so
calamitous
as
this
which
had
now
overtaken
that
poor
lady
at
castle
richmond
could
she
live
and
support
such
a
burden
could
she
bear
the
eyes
of
people
when
she
knew
the
light
in
which
she
must
be
now
regarded
to
lose
at
one
blow
her
name
her
pride
of
place
her
woman
rank
and
high
respect
could
it
be
possible
that
she
would
still
live
on
it
was
thus
that
lady
desmond
thought
and
had
any
one
told
her
that
this
degraded
mother
would
that
very
day
come
down
from
her
room
and
sit
watchful
by
her
sleeping
son
in
order
that
she
might
comfort
and
encourage
him
when
he
awoke
she
would
not
have
found
it
in
her
heart
to
believe
such
a
marvel
but
then
lady
desmond
knew
but
one
solace
in
her
sorrows
had
but
one
comfort
in
her
sad
reflections
she
was
countess
of
desmond
and
that
was
all
to
lady
fitzgerald
had
been
vouchsafed
other
solace
and
other
comforts
and
then
on
one
point
the
countess
made
herself
fixed
as
fate
by
thinking
and
upon
it
till
no
doubt
remained
upon
her
mind
the
match
between
clara
and
herbert
must
be
broken
off
let
the
cost
be
what
it
might
and
a
point
on
which
there
was
more
room
for
doubt
and
more
pain
in
coming
to
a
conclusion
that
other
match
with
the
more
fortunate
cousin
must
be
encouraged
and
carried
out
for
herself
if
her
hope
was
small
while
owen
was
needy
and
of
poor
account
what
hope
could
there
be
now
that
he
would
be
rich
and
great
moreover
owen
loved
clara
and
not
herself
and
clara
hand
would
once
more
be
vacant
and
ready
for
the
winning
for
herself
her
only
chance
had
been
in
clara
coming
marriage
in
all
this
she
knew
that
there
would
be
difficulty
she
was
sure
enough
that
clara
would
at
first
feel
the
imprudent
generosity
of
youth
and
offer
to
join
her
poverty
to
herbert
poverty
that
was
a
matter
of
course
she
lady
desmond
herself
would
have
done
this
at
clara
age
so
at
least
to
herself
she
said
and
also
to
her
daughter
but
a
little
time
and
a
little
patience
and
a
little
care
would
set
all
this
in
a
proper
light
herbert
would
go
away
and
would
gradually
be
forgotten
owen
would
again
come
forth
from
beneath
the
clouds
with
renewed
splendour
and
then
was
it
not
probable
that
in
her
very
heart
of
hearts
owen
was
the
man
whom
clara
had
ever
loved
and
thus
having
realized
to
herself
the
facts
which
herbert
had
told
her
she
prepared
to
make
them
known
to
her
daughter
she
got
up
from
her
chair
intending
at
first
to
seek
her
and
then
changing
her
purpose
rang
the
bell
and
sent
for
her
she
was
astonished
to
find
how
violently
she
herself
was
affected
not
so
much
by
the
circumstances
as
by
this
duty
which
had
fallen
to
her
of
telling
them
to
her
child
she
put
one
hand
upon
the
other
and
felt
that
she
herself
was
in
a
tremor
and
was
conscious
that
the
blood
was
running
quick
round
her
heart
clara
came
down
and
going
to
her
customary
seat
waited
till
her
mother
should
speak
to
her
fitzgerald
has
brought
very
dreadful
news
lady
desmond
said
after
a
minute
pause
oh
mamma
said
clara
she
had
expected
bad
tidings
having
thought
of
all
manner
of
miseries
while
she
had
been
up
stairs
alone
but
there
was
that
in
her
mother
voice
which
seemed
to
be
worse
than
the
worst
of
her
anticipations
dreadful
indeed
my
child
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
them
to
you
but
i
must
caution
you
before
i
do
so
to
place
a
guard
upon
your
feelings
that
which
i
have
to
say
must
necessarily
alter
all
your
future
prospects
and
unfortunately
make
your
marrying
herbert
fitzgerald
quite
impossible
mamma
she
exclaimed
with
a
loud
voice
jumping
from
her
chair
not
marry
him
why
what
can
he
have
done
is
it
his
wish
to
break
it
off
lady
desmond
had
calculated
that
she
would
best
effect
her
object
by
at
once
impressing
her
daughter
with
the
idea
that
under
the
circumstances
which
were
about
to
be
narrated
this
marriage
would
not
only
be
imprudent
but
altogether
impracticable
and
out
of
the
question
clara
must
be
made
to
understand
at
once
that
the
circumstances
gave
her
no
option
that
the
affair
was
of
such
a
nature
as
to
make
it
a
thing
manifest
to
everybody
that
she
could
not
now
marry
herbert
fitzgerald
she
must
not
be
left
to
think
whether
she
could
or
whether
she
could
not
exercise
her
own
generosity
and
therefore
not
without
discretion
the
countess
announced
at
once
to
her
the
conclusion
at
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
arrive
but
clara
was
not
a
girl
to
adopt
such
a
conclusion
on
any
other
judgment
than
her
own
or
to
be
led
in
such
a
matter
by
the
feelings
of
any
other
person
sit
down
my
dear
and
i
will
explain
it
all
but
dearest
clara
grieved
as
i
must
be
to
grieve
you
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
again
that
it
must
be
as
i
say
for
both
your
sakes
it
must
be
so
but
especially
perhaps
for
his
but
when
i
have
told
you
my
story
you
will
understand
that
this
must
be
so
tell
me
then
mother
she
said
this
for
lady
desmond
had
again
paused
wo
you
sit
down
dearest
well
yes
it
does
not
matter
and
clara
at
her
mother
bidding
sat
down
and
then
the
story
was
told
to
her
it
was
a
difficult
tale
for
a
mother
to
tell
to
so
young
a
child
to
a
child
whom
she
had
regarded
as
being
so
very
young
there
were
various
little
points
of
law
which
she
thought
that
she
was
obliged
to
explain
how
it
was
necessary
that
the
castle
richmond
property
should
go
to
an
and
how
it
was
impossible
that
herbert
should
be
that
seeing
that
he
had
not
been
born
in
lawful
wedlock
all
these
things
lady
desmond
attempted
to
explain
or
was
about
to
attempt
such
explanation
but
desisted
on
finding
that
her
daughter
understood
them
as
well
as
she
herself
did
and
then
she
had
to
make
it
also
intelligible
to
clara
that
owen
would
be
called
on
when
sir
thomas
should
die
to
fill
the
position
and
enjoy
the
wealth
accruing
to
the
heir
of
castle
richmond
when
owen
fitzgerald
name
was
mentioned
a
slight
blush
came
upon
cheek
it
was
very
slight
but
nevertheless
her
mother
saw
it
and
took
advantage
of
it
to
say
a
word
in
owen
favour
poor
owen
she
said
he
will
not
be
the
first
to
triumph
in
this
change
of
fortune
i
am
sure
he
will
not
said
clara
he
is
much
too
generous
for
that
and
then
the
countess
began
to
hope
that
the
task
might
not
be
so
very
difficult
ignorant
woman
had
she
been
able
to
read
one
page
in
her
daughter
heart
she
would
have
known
that
the
task
was
impossible
after
that
the
story
was
told
out
to
the
end
without
further
interruption
and
then
clara
hiding
her
face
within
her
hands
on
the
head
of
the
sofa
uttered
one
long
piteous
moan
it
is
all
very
dreadful
said
the
countess
oh
lady
fitzgerald
dear
lady
fitzgerald
sobbed
forth
clara
yes
indeed
poor
lady
fitzgerald
her
fate
is
so
dreadful
that
i
know
not
how
to
think
of
it
but
mamma
and
as
she
spoke
clara
pushed
back
from
her
forehead
her
hair
with
both
her
hands
showing
as
she
did
so
the
form
of
her
forehead
and
the
firmness
of
purpose
that
was
written
there
legible
to
any
eyes
that
could
read
but
mamma
you
are
wrong
about
my
not
marrying
herbert
fitzgerald
why
should
i
not
marry
him
not
now
as
we
perhaps
might
have
done
but
for
this
but
at
some
future
time
when
he
may
think
himself
able
to
support
a
wife
mamma
i
shall
not
break
our
engagement
certainly
not
this
was
said
in
a
tone
of
voice
so
very
decided
that
lady
desmond
had
to
acknowledge
to
herself
that
there
would
be
difficulty
in
her
task
but
she
still
did
not
doubt
that
she
would
have
her
way
if
not
by
concession
on
the
part
of
her
daughter
then
by
concession
on
the
part
of
herbert
fitzgerald
i
can
understand
your
generosity
of
feeling
my
dear
she
said
and
at
your
age
i
should
probably
have
felt
the
same
and
therefore
i
do
not
ask
you
to
take
any
steps
towards
breaking
your
engagement
the
offer
must
come
from
fitzgerald
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
will
come
he
as
a
man
of
honour
will
know
that
he
can
not
now
offer
to
marry
you
and
he
will
also
know
as
a
man
of
sense
that
it
would
be
ruin
for
him
to
think
of
of
such
a
marriage
under
his
present
circumstances
why
mamma
why
should
it
be
ruin
to
him
why
my
dear
do
you
think
that
a
wife
with
a
titled
name
can
be
of
advantage
to
a
young
man
who
has
not
only
got
his
bread
to
earn
but
even
to
look
out
for
a
way
in
which
he
may
earn
it
if
there
be
nothing
to
hurt
him
but
the
titled
name
that
difficulty
shall
be
easily
conquered
dearest
clara
you
know
what
i
mean
you
must
be
aware
that
a
girl
of
your
rank
and
brought
up
as
you
have
been
can
not
be
a
fitting
wife
for
a
man
who
will
now
have
to
struggle
with
the
world
at
every
turn
clara
as
this
was
said
to
her
and
as
she
prepared
to
answer
blushed
deeply
for
she
felt
herself
obliged
to
speak
on
a
matter
which
had
never
yet
been
subject
of
speech
between
her
and
her
mother
mamma
she
said
i
can
not
agree
with
you
there
i
may
have
what
the
world
calls
rank
but
nevertheless
we
have
been
poor
and
i
have
not
been
brought
up
with
costly
habits
why
should
i
not
live
with
my
husband
as
as
as
poorly
as
i
have
lived
with
my
mother
you
are
not
rich
dear
mamma
and
why
should
i
be
lady
desmond
did
not
answer
her
daughter
at
once
but
she
was
not
silent
because
an
answer
failed
her
her
answer
would
have
been
ready
enough
had
she
dared
to
speak
it
out
yes
it
is
true
we
have
been
poor
i
your
mother
did
by
my
imprudence
bring
down
upon
my
head
and
on
yours
absolute
unrelenting
pitiless
poverty
and
because
i
did
so
i
have
never
known
one
happy
hour
i
have
spent
my
days
in
bitter
remorse
in
regretting
the
want
of
those
things
which
it
has
been
the
more
terrible
to
want
as
they
are
the
customary
attributes
of
people
of
my
rank
i
have
been
driven
to
hate
those
around
me
who
have
been
rich
because
i
have
been
poor
i
have
been
utterly
friendless
because
i
have
been
poor
i
have
been
able
to
do
none
of
those
sweet
soft
lovely
things
by
doing
which
other
women
win
the
smiles
of
the
world
because
i
have
been
poor
poverty
and
rank
together
have
made
me
wretched
have
left
me
without
employment
without
society
and
without
love
and
now
would
you
tell
me
that
because
i
have
been
poor
you
would
choose
to
be
poor
also
it
would
have
been
thus
that
she
would
have
answered
had
she
been
accustomed
to
speak
out
her
thoughts
but
she
had
ever
been
accustomed
to
conceal
them
i
was
thinking
quite
as
much
of
him
as
of
you
at
last
she
said
such
an
engagement
to
you
would
be
fraught
with
much
misery
but
to
him
it
would
be
ruinous
i
do
not
think
it
mamma
but
it
is
not
necessary
clara
that
you
should
do
anything
you
will
wait
of
course
and
see
what
herbert
may
say
himself
herbert
wait
half
a
moment
my
love
i
shall
be
very
much
surprised
if
we
do
not
find
that
fitzgerald
himself
will
tell
you
that
the
match
must
be
abandoned
but
that
will
make
no
difference
mamma
no
difference
my
dear
you
can
not
marry
him
against
his
will
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
would
wish
to
bind
him
to
his
engagement
if
he
himself
thought
it
would
be
to
his
disadvantage
yes
i
will
bind
him
to
it
clara
i
will
make
him
know
that
it
is
not
for
his
disadvantage
i
will
make
him
understand
that
a
friend
and
companion
who
loves
him
as
i
love
him
as
no
one
else
will
ever
love
him
now
for
i
love
him
because
he
was
so
when
he
came
to
me
and
because
he
is
now
so
that
such
a
wife
as
i
will
be
can
not
be
a
burden
to
him
i
will
cling
to
him
whether
he
throws
me
off
or
no
a
word
from
him
might
have
broken
our
engagement
before
but
a
thousand
words
can
not
do
it
now
lady
desmond
stared
at
her
daughter
for
clara
in
her
excitement
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
the
countess
had
certainly
not
expected
all
this
and
she
was
beginning
to
think
that
the
subject
for
the
present
might
as
well
be
left
alone
but
clara
had
not
done
as
yet
mamma
she
said
i
will
not
do
anything
without
telling
you
but
i
can
not
leave
herbert
in
all
his
misery
to
think
that
i
have
no
sympathy
with
him
i
shall
write
to
him
not
before
he
writes
to
you
clara
you
would
not
wish
to
be
indelicate
i
know
but
little
about
delicacy
what
people
call
delicacy
but
i
will
not
be
ungenerous
or
unkind
mamma
you
brought
us
two
together
was
it
not
so
did
you
not
do
so
fearing
that
i
might
might
still
care
for
herbert
cousin
you
did
it
and
half
wishing
to
obey
you
half
attracted
by
all
his
goodness
i
did
learn
to
love
herbert
fitzgerald
and
i
did
learn
to
forget
no
but
i
learned
to
cease
to
love
his
cousin
you
did
this
and
rejoiced
at
it
and
now
what
you
did
must
remain
done
but
dearest
clara
it
will
not
be
for
his
good
it
shall
be
for
his
good
mamma
i
would
not
desert
him
now
for
all
that
the
world
could
give
me
neither
for
mother
nor
brother
could
i
do
that
without
your
leave
i
would
not
have
given
him
the
right
to
regard
me
as
his
own
but
now
i
can
not
take
that
right
back
again
even
at
your
wish
i
must
write
to
him
at
once
mamma
and
tell
him
this
clara
at
any
rate
you
must
not
do
that
that
at
least
i
must
forbid
mother
you
can
not
forbid
it
now
the
daughter
said
after
walking
twice
the
length
of
the
room
in
silence
if
i
be
not
allowed
to
send
a
letter
i
shall
leave
the
house
and
go
to
him
this
was
all
very
dreadful
lady
desmond
was
astounded
at
the
manner
in
which
her
daughter
carried
herself
and
the
voice
with
which
she
spoke
the
form
of
her
face
was
altered
and
the
very
step
with
which
she
trod
was
unlike
her
usual
gait
what
would
lady
desmond
do
she
was
not
prepared
to
confine
her
daughter
as
a
prisoner
nor
could
she
publicly
forbid
the
people
about
the
place
to
go
upon
her
message
i
did
not
expect
that
you
would
have
been
so
undutiful
she
said
i
hope
i
am
not
so
clara
answered
but
now
my
first
duty
is
to
him
did
you
not
sanction
our
loving
each
other
people
can
not
call
back
their
hearts
and
their
pledges
you
will
at
any
rate
wait
till
clara
it
is
dark
now
said
clara
despondingly
looking
out
through
the
window
upon
the
falling
night
i
suppose
i
can
not
send
and
you
will
show
me
what
you
write
dearest
no
mamma
if
i
wrote
it
for
your
eyes
it
could
not
be
the
same
as
if
i
wrote
it
only
for
his
very
gloomy
sombre
and
silent
was
the
countess
of
desmond
all
that
night
nothing
further
was
said
about
the
fitzgeralds
between
her
and
her
daughter
before
they
went
to
bed
and
then
lady
desmond
did
speak
a
few
futile
words
clara
she
said
you
had
better
think
over
what
we
have
been
saying
in
bed
you
will
be
more
collected
morning
i
shall
think
of
it
of
course
said
clara
but
thinking
can
make
no
difference
and
then
just
touching
her
mother
forehead
with
her
lips
she
went
off
slowly
to
her
room
what
sort
of
a
letter
she
wrote
when
she
got
there
we
have
already
seen
and
have
seen
also
that
she
took
effective
steps
to
have
her
letter
carried
to
castle
richmond
at
an
hour
sufficiently
early
in
the
morning
there
was
no
danger
that
the
countess
would
stop
the
message
for
the
letter
had
been
read
twenty
times
by
emmeline
and
mary
and
had
been
carried
by
herbert
to
his
mother
room
before
lady
desmond
had
left
her
bed
do
not
set
your
heart
on
it
too
warmly
said
herbert
mother
to
him
but
is
she
not
excellent
said
herbert
it
is
because
she
speaks
of
you
in
such
a
way
you
would
not
wish
to
bring
her
into
misery
because
of
her
excellence
but
mother
i
am
still
a
man
said
herbert
this
was
too
much
for
the
suffering
woman
the
one
fault
of
whose
life
had
brought
her
son
to
such
a
pass
and
throwing
her
arm
round
his
neck
she
wept
upon
his
shoulders
there
were
other
messengers
went
and
came
that
day
between
desmond
court
and
castle
richmond
clara
and
her
mother
saw
nothing
of
each
other
early
in
the
morning
they
did
not
breakfast
together
nor
was
there
a
word
said
between
them
on
the
subject
of
the
fitzgeralds
but
lady
desmond
early
in
the
morning
early
for
her
that
is
sent
her
note
also
to
castle
richmond
it
was
addressed
to
aunt
letty
miss
letitia
fitzgerald
and
went
to
say
that
lady
desmond
was
very
anxious
to
see
miss
letty
under
the
present
circumstances
of
the
family
as
described
to
lady
desmond
by
herbert
fitzgerald
she
felt
that
she
could
not
ask
to
see
his
mother
it
was
thus
that
she
overcame
the
difficulty
which
presented
itself
to
her
as
to
the
proper
title
now
to
be
given
to
lady
fitzgerald
but
perhaps
miss
letty
would
be
good
enough
to
see
her
if
she
called
at
such
and
such
an
hour
aunt
letty
much
perplexed
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
say
that
she
would
see
her
the
countess
must
now
be
looked
on
as
closely
connected
with
the
family
at
any
rate
until
that
match
were
broken
off
and
therefore
aunt
letty
had
no
alternative
and
so
precisely
at
the
hour
named
the
countess
and
aunt
letty
were
seated
together
in
the
little
of
which
mention
has
before
been
made
no
two
women
were
ever
closeted
together
who
were
more
unlike
each
other
except
that
they
had
one
common
strong
love
for
family
rank
but
in
aunt
letty
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
this
passion
was
not
unwholesome
or
malevolent
in
its
course
of
action
she
delighted
in
being
a
fitzgerald
and
in
knowing
that
her
branch
of
the
fitzgeralds
had
been
considerable
people
ever
since
her
norman
ancestor
had
come
over
to
ireland
with
strongbow
but
then
she
had
a
useful
idea
that
considerable
people
should
do
a
considerable
deal
of
good
her
family
pride
operated
more
inwardly
than
outwardly
inwardly
as
regarded
her
own
family
and
not
outwardly
as
regarded
the
world
her
brother
and
her
nephew
and
her
and
nieces
were
she
thought
among
the
highest
commoners
in
ireland
they
were
gentlefolks
of
the
first
water
and
walked
openly
before
the
world
accordingly
proving
their
claim
to
gentle
blood
by
gentle
deeds
and
honest
conduct
perhaps
she
did
think
too
much
of
the
fitzgeralds
of
castle
richmond
but
the
sin
was
one
of
which
no
recording
angel
could
have
made
much
in
his
entry
that
she
was
a
stupid
old
woman
prejudiced
in
the
highest
degree
and
horribly
ignorant
of
all
the
world
beyond
her
own
very
narrow
circle
even
of
that
i
do
not
think
that
the
recording
angel
could
under
the
circumstances
have
made
a
great
deal
and
now
how
was
her
family
pride
affected
by
this
horrible
catastrophe
that
had
been
made
known
to
her
herbert
the
heir
whom
as
heir
she
had
almost
idolized
was
nobody
her
whom
she
had
learned
to
love
with
the
whole
of
her
big
heart
was
no
her
brother
was
one
who
in
lieu
of
adding
glory
to
the
family
would
always
be
regarded
as
the
most
unfortunate
of
the
fitzgerald
baronets
but
with
her
human
nature
was
stronger
than
family
pride
and
she
loved
them
all
not
better
but
more
tenderly
than
ever
the
two
ladies
were
closeted
together
for
about
two
hours
and
then
when
the
door
was
opened
aunt
letty
might
have
been
seen
with
her
bonnet
much
on
one
side
and
her
poor
old
eyes
and
cheeks
red
with
weeping
the
countess
too
held
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
as
she
got
back
into
her
pony
carriage
she
saw
no
one
else
there
but
aunt
letty
and
from
her
mood
when
she
returned
to
desmond
court
it
might
be
surmised
that
from
aunt
letty
she
had
learned
little
to
comfort
her
they
will
be
beggars
she
said
to
herself
beggars
when
the
door
of
her
own
room
had
closed
upon
her
and
there
are
few
people
in
the
world
who
held
such
beggary
in
less
esteem
than
did
the
countess
of
desmond
it
may
almost
be
said
that
she
hated
herself
on
account
of
her
own
poverty
chapter
xxix
ill
news
flies
fast
a
dull
cold
wretched
week
passed
over
their
heads
at
castle
richmond
during
which
they
did
nothing
but
realize
the
truth
of
their
position
and
then
came
a
letter
from
prendergast
addressed
to
herbert
in
which
he
stated
that
such
inquiries
as
he
had
hitherto
made
left
no
doubt
on
his
mind
that
the
man
named
mollett
who
had
lately
made
repeated
visits
at
castle
richmond
was
he
who
had
formerly
taken
the
house
in
dorsetshire
under
the
name
of
talbot
in
his
packet
prendergast
sent
copies
of
documents
and
of
verbal
evidence
which
he
had
managed
to
obtain
but
with
the
actual
details
of
these
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
trouble
those
who
are
following
me
in
this
story
in
this
letter
prendergast
also
recommended
that
some
intercourse
should
be
had
with
owen
fitzgerald
it
was
expedient
he
said
that
all
the
parties
concerned
should
recognise
owen
position
as
the
heir
presumptive
to
the
title
and
estate
and
as
he
he
said
had
found
fitzgerald
of
hap
house
to
be
forbearing
generous
and
he
thought
that
this
intercourse
might
be
conducted
without
enmity
or
ill
blood
and
then
he
suggested
that
somers
should
see
owen
fitzgerald
all
this
herbert
explained
to
his
father
gently
and
without
complaint
but
it
seemed
now
as
though
sir
thomas
had
ceased
to
interest
himself
in
the
matter
such
battle
as
it
had
been
in
his
power
to
make
he
had
made
to
save
his
son
heritage
and
his
name
and
happiness
even
at
the
expense
of
his
own
conscience
that
battle
had
gone
altogether
against
him
and
now
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
but
to
turn
his
face
to
the
wall
and
die
absolute
ruin
through
his
fault
had
come
upon
him
and
all
that
belonged
to
him
ruin
that
would
now
be
known
to
the
world
at
large
and
it
was
beyond
his
power
to
face
that
world
again
in
that
the
glory
was
gone
from
the
house
of
his
son
and
of
his
son
mother
the
glory
was
gone
from
his
own
house
he
made
no
attempt
to
leave
his
bed
though
strongly
recommended
so
to
do
by
his
own
family
doctor
and
then
a
physician
came
down
from
dublin
who
could
only
feel
whatever
he
might
say
how
impossible
it
is
to
administer
to
a
mind
diseased
the
mind
of
that
poor
man
was
diseased
past
all
curing
in
this
world
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
but
to
die
herbert
of
course
answered
clara
letter
but
he
did
not
go
over
to
see
her
during
that
week
nor
indeed
for
some
little
time
afterwards
he
answered
it
at
considerable
length
professing
his
ready
willingness
to
give
back
to
clara
her
troth
and
even
recommending
her
with
very
strong
logic
and
unanswerable
arguments
of
worldly
sense
to
regard
their
union
as
unwise
and
even
impossible
but
nevertheless
there
protruded
through
all
his
sense
and
all
his
rhetoric
evidences
of
love
and
of
a
desire
for
love
returned
which
were
much
more
unanswerable
than
his
arguments
and
much
stronger
than
his
logic
clara
read
his
letter
not
as
he
would
have
advised
her
to
read
it
but
certainly
in
the
manner
which
best
pleased
his
heart
and
answered
it
again
declaring
that
all
that
he
said
was
no
avail
he
might
be
false
to
her
if
he
would
if
through
fickleness
of
heart
and
purpose
he
chose
to
abandon
her
she
would
never
complain
never
at
least
aloud
but
she
would
not
be
false
to
him
nor
were
her
inclinations
such
as
to
make
it
likely
that
she
should
be
fickle
even
though
her
affection
might
be
tried
by
a
delay
of
years
love
with
her
had
been
too
serious
to
be
thrown
aside
all
which
was
rather
strong
language
on
the
part
of
a
young
lady
but
was
thought
by
those
other
young
ladies
at
castle
richmond
to
show
the
very
essence
of
becoming
they
pronounced
clara
to
be
perfect
in
feeling
and
in
judgment
and
herbert
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
contradict
them
and
of
all
these
doings
writings
and
resolves
clara
dutifully
told
her
mother
poor
lady
desmond
was
at
her
wits
end
in
the
matter
she
could
scold
her
daughter
but
she
had
no
other
power
of
doing
anything
clara
had
so
taken
the
bit
between
her
teeth
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
check
her
with
any
usual
rein
in
these
days
young
ladies
are
seldom
deprived
by
force
of
paper
pen
and
ink
and
the
absolute
incarceration
of
such
an
offender
would
be
still
more
unusual
another
countess
would
have
taken
her
daughter
away
either
to
london
and
a
series
of
balls
or
to
the
south
of
italy
or
to
the
family
castle
in
the
north
of
scotland
but
poor
lady
desmond
had
not
the
power
of
other
countesses
now
that
it
was
put
to
the
trial
she
found
that
she
had
no
power
even
over
her
own
daughter
mamma
it
was
your
own
doing
clara
would
say
and
the
countess
would
feel
that
this
alluded
not
only
to
her
daughter
engagement
with
herbert
the
disinherited
but
also
to
her
with
owen
the
heir
under
these
circumstances
lady
desmond
sent
for
her
son
the
earl
was
still
at
eton
but
was
now
grown
to
be
almost
a
man
such
a
man
as
forward
eton
boys
are
at
sixteen
tall
and
lathy
and
handsome
with
soft
incipient
whiskers
a
bold
brow
and
blushing
cheeks
with
all
a
boy
love
for
frolic
still
strong
within
him
but
some
touch
of
a
man
pride
to
check
it
in
her
difficulty
lady
desmond
sent
for
the
young
earl
who
had
now
not
been
home
since
the
previous
midsummer
hoping
that
his
young
manhood
might
have
some
effect
in
saving
his
sister
from
the
disgrace
of
a
marriage
which
would
make
her
so
totally
bankrupt
both
in
wealth
and
rank
somers
did
go
once
to
hap
house
at
herbert
instigation
but
very
little
came
of
his
visit
he
had
always
disliked
owen
regarding
him
as
an
unthrift
any
close
connexion
with
whom
could
only
bring
contamination
on
the
fitzgerald
property
and
owen
had
returned
the
feeling
tenfold
his
pride
had
been
wounded
by
what
he
had
considered
to
be
the
agent
insolence
and
he
had
stigmatised
somers
to
his
friends
as
a
mercenary
prig
very
little
therefore
came
of
the
visit
somers
to
give
him
his
due
had
attempted
to
do
his
best
being
anxious
for
herbert
sake
to
conciliate
owen
perhaps
having
and
why
not
some
eye
to
the
future
agency
but
owen
was
hard
and
cold
and
uncommunicative
very
unlike
what
he
had
before
been
to
prendergast
but
then
prendergast
had
never
offended
his
pride
you
may
tell
my
cousin
herbert
he
said
with
some
little
special
emphasis
on
the
word
cousin
that
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
as
soon
as
he
feels
himself
able
to
meet
me
it
will
be
for
the
good
of
us
both
that
we
should
have
some
conversation
together
will
you
tell
him
somers
that
i
shall
be
happy
to
go
to
him
or
to
see
him
here
perhaps
my
going
to
castle
richmond
during
the
present
illness
of
sir
thomas
may
be
inconvenient
and
this
was
all
that
somers
could
get
from
him
in
a
very
short
time
the
whole
story
became
known
to
everybody
round
the
neighbourhood
and
what
would
have
been
the
good
of
keeping
it
secret
there
are
some
secrets
kept
as
secrets
because
they
can
not
well
be
discussed
openly
which
may
be
allowed
to
leak
out
with
so
much
advantage
the
day
must
come
and
that
apparently
at
no
distant
time
when
all
the
world
would
know
the
fate
of
that
fitzgerald
family
when
sir
owen
must
walk
into
the
hall
of
castle
richmond
the
undoubted
owner
of
the
mansion
and
demesne
why
then
keep
it
secret
herbert
openly
declared
his
wish
to
somers
that
there
should
be
no
secret
in
the
matter
there
is
no
disgrace
he
said
thinking
of
his
mother
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
let
the
world
say
what
it
will
down
in
the
servants
hall
the
news
came
to
them
gradually
whispered
about
from
one
to
another
they
hardly
understood
what
it
meant
or
how
it
had
come
to
pass
but
they
did
know
that
their
marriage
had
been
no
marriage
and
that
their
master
son
was
no
heir
jones
said
not
a
word
in
the
matter
to
any
one
indeed
since
that
day
on
which
she
had
been
confronted
with
mollett
she
had
not
associated
with
the
servants
at
all
but
had
kept
herself
close
to
her
mistress
she
understood
what
it
all
meant
perfectly
and
the
depth
of
the
tragedy
had
so
cowed
her
spirit
that
she
hardly
dared
to
speak
of
it
who
told
the
servants
or
who
does
tell
servants
of
such
matters
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
before
prendergast
had
been
three
days
out
of
the
house
they
all
knew
that
the
owen
of
hap
house
was
to
be
the
future
master
of
castle
richmond
an
a
sore
day
it
be
a
sore
day
a
sore
day
said
richard
seated
in
an
by
the
fire
at
the
end
of
the
servants
hall
shaking
his
head
despondingly
faix
an
you
may
say
that
said
corney
the
footman
that
misther
owen
will
go
tatthering
away
to
the
divil
when
the
old

said
richard
who
had
seen
biddy
grow
up
from
a
slip
of
a
girl
and
therefore
was
competent
to
snub
her
at
every
word

of
this
not
a
step
she
wo
thin
said
corney
she
go
back
to
owen
he
was
her
fust
love
you
see
else
and
so
the
matter
was
discussed
in
the
servants
hall
at
the
great
house
but
perhaps
the
greatest
surprise
the
greatest
curiosity
and
the
greatest
consternation
were
felt
at
the
parsonage
the
rumour
reached
townsend
at
one
of
the
relief
committees
and
townsend
from
the
mouth
of
one
of
her
servants
during
his
absence
on
the
same
day
and
when
townsend
returned
to
the
parsonage
they
met
each
other
with
blank
faces
oh
√¶neas
said
she
before
she
could
get
his
greatcoat
from
off
his
shoulders
have
you
heard
the
news
what
news
about
castle
richmond
yes
about
castle
richmond
and
then
she
knew
that
he
had
heard
it
some
glimmering
of
lady
fitzgerald
early
history
had
been
known
to
both
of
them
as
it
had
been
known
almost
to
all
in
the
country
but
in
late
years
this
history
had
been
so
much
forgotten
that
men
had
ceased
to
talk
of
it
and
this
calamity
therefore
came
with
all
the
weight
of
a
new
misfortune
and
√¶neas
who
told
you
of
it
she
asked
as
they
sat
together
over
the
fire
in
their
dingy
dirty
parlour
well
strange
to
say
i
heard
it
first
from
father
barney
oh
mercy
and
is
it
all
about
the
country
in
that
way
herbert
you
know
has
not
been
at
any
one
of
the
committees
for
the
last
ten
days
and
somers
for
the
last
week
past
has
been
as
silent
as
death
so
much
so
that
that
horrid
creature
father
columb
would
have
made
a
regular
set
speech
the
other
day
at
gortnaclough
if
i
had
put
him
down
dear
dear
dear
said
townsend
and
i
was
talking
to
father
barney
about
this
about
somers
that
is
yes
yes
yes
and
then
he
said
suppose
you
know
what
has
happened
at
castle
richmond
how
on
earth
had
he
learned
asked
townsend
jealous
that
a
roman
catholic
priest
should
have
heard
such
completely
protestant
news
before
the
protestant
parson
and
his
wife
oh
they
learn
everything
from
the
servants
i
suppose
of
course
the
mean
creatures
said
townsend
forgetting
probably
her
own
little
conversation
with
her
own
man
of
all
work
that
morning
but
go
on
√¶neas
has
happened
said
i
castle
richmond
you
heard
said
he
and
i
was
obliged
to
own
that
i
had
not
though
i
saw
that
it
gave
him
a
kind
of
triumph
said
he
bad
news
has
reached
them
indeed
the
worst
of
news
and
then
he
told
me
about
lady
fitzgerald
to
give
him
his
due
i
must
say
that
he
was
very
sorry
very
sorry
poor
young
fellow
he
said
poor
young
fellow
and
i
saw
that
he
turned
away
his
face
to
hide
a
tear
crocodile
tears
said
townsend
no
they
were
not
said
her
reverend
lord
and
father
barney
is
not
so
bad
as
i
once
thought
him
i
hope
you
are
not
going
over
too
√¶neas
and
his
consort
almost
cried
as
such
a
horrid
thought
entered
her
head
in
her
ideas
any
feeling
short
of
absolute
enmity
to
a
servant
of
the
church
of
rome
was
an
abandonment
of
some
portion
of
the
protestant
basis
of
the
church
of
england
the
small
end
of
the
wedge
she
would
call
it
when
people
around
her
would
suggest
that
the
heart
of
a
roman
catholic
priest
might
possibly
not
be
altogether
black
and
devilish
well
i
hope
not
my
dear
said
townsend
with
a
slight
touch
of
sarcasm
in
his
voice
but
as
i
was
saying
father
barney
told
me
then
that
this
prendergast
oh
i
had
known
of
his
being
there
from
the
day
of
his
coming
this
prendergast
it
seems
knew
the
whole
affair
from
beginning
to
end
but
how
did
he
know
it
√¶neas
that
i
ca
tell
you
he
was
a
friend
of
sir
thomas
before
his
marriage
i
know
that
and
he
has
told
them
that
it
is
of
no
use
their
attempting
to
keep
it
secret
he
was
over
at
hap
house
with
owen
fitzgerald
before
he
went
and
has
owen
fitzgerald
been
told
yes
he
has
been
told
told
that
he
is
to
be
the
next
heir
so
father
barney
says
townsend
wished
in
her
heart
that
the
news
could
have
reached
her
through
a
purer
source
but
all
this
coming
though
it
did
from
father
barney
tallied
too
completely
with
what
she
herself
had
heard
to
leave
on
her
mind
any
doubt
of
its
truth
and
then
she
began
to
think
of
lady
fitzgerald
and
her
condition
of
herbert
and
of
his
and
of
the
condition
of
them
all
till
by
degrees
her
mind
passed
away
from
father
barney
and
all
his
iniquities
it
is
very
dreadful
she
said
in
a
low
voice
very
dreadful
very
dreadful
i
hardly
know
how
to
think
of
it
and
i
fear
that
sir
thomas
will
not
live
many
months
to
give
them
even
the
benefit
of
his
life
interest
and
when
he
dies
all
will
be
gone
everything
and
then
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
also
and
in
his
also
after
a
while
it
is
very
easy
for
a
clergyman
in
his
pulpit
to
preach
eloquently
upon
the
vileness
of
worldly
wealth
and
the
futility
of
worldly
station
but
where
will
you
ever
find
one
who
when
the
time
of
proof
shall
come
will
give
proof
that
he
himself
feels
what
he
preaches
townsend
was
customarily
loud
and
eager
upon
this
subject
and
yet
he
was
now
shedding
tears
because
his
young
friend
herbert
was
deprived
of
his
inheritance
chapter
xxx
pallida
mors
somers
returning
from
hap
house
gave
owen
message
to
herbert
fitzgerald
but
at
the
same
time
told
him
that
he
did
not
think
any
good
would
come
of
such
a
meeting
i
went
over
there
he
said
because
i
would
not
willingly
omit
anything
that
prendergast
had
suggested
but
i
did
not
expect
any
good
to
come
of
it
you
know
what
i
have
always
thought
of
owen
fitzgerald
but
prendergast
said
that
he
behaved
so
well
he
did
not
know
prendergast
and
was
cowed
for
the
moment
by
what
he
had
heard
that
was
natural
enough
you
do
as
you
like
however
only
do
not
have
him
over
to
castle
richmond
owen
however
did
not
trust
solely
to
somers
but
on
the
following
day
wrote
to
herbert
suggesting
that
they
had
better
meet
and
begging
that
the
place
and
time
of
meeting
might
be
named
he
himself
again
suggested
hap
house
and
declared
that
he
would
be
at
home
on
any
day
and
at
any
hour
that
his
cousin
might
name
only
as
he
added
the
sooner
the
better
herbert
wrote
back
by
the
same
messenger
saying
that
he
would
be
with
him
early
on
the
following
morning
and
on
the
following
morning
he
drove
up
to
the
door
of
hap
house
while
owen
was
still
sitting
with
his
and
knife
and
fork
before
him
captain
donnellan
whom
we
saw
there
on
the
occasion
of
our
first
morning
visit
was
now
gone
and
owen
fitzgerald
was
all
alone
in
his
home
the
captain
had
been
an
accustomed
guest
spending
perhaps
half
his
time
there
during
the
hunting
season
but
since
prendergast
had
been
at
hap
house
he
had
been
made
to
understand
that
the
master
would
fain
be
alone
and
since
that
day
owen
had
never
hunted
nor
been
noticed
in
his
old
haunts
nor
had
been
seen
talking
to
his
old
friends
he
had
remained
at
home
sitting
over
the
fire
thinking
wandering
up
and
down
his
own
avenue
or
standing
about
the
stable
idly
almost
unconscious
of
the
grooming
of
his
horses
once
and
once
only
he
had
been
mounted
and
then
as
the
dusk
of
evening
was
coming
on
he
had
trotted
over
quickly
to
desmond
court
as
though
he
had
in
hand
some
purport
of
great
moment
but
if
so
he
changed
his
mind
when
he
came
to
the
gate
for
he
walked
on
slowly
for
three
or
four
hundred
yards
beyond
it
and
then
turning
his
horse
head
slowly
made
his
way
back
past
the
gate
and
then
trotted
quickly
home
to
hap
house
in
these
moments
of
his
life
he
must
make
or
mar
himself
for
life
was
so
that
he
felt
it
and
how
should
he
make
himself
or
how
avoid
the
marring
that
was
the
question
which
he
now
strove
to
answer
when
herbert
entered
the
room
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
quickly
up
to
his
visitor
with
extended
hand
and
a
look
of
welcome
in
his
face
his
manner
was
very
different
from
that
with
which
he
had
turned
and
parted
from
his
cousin
not
many
days
since
in
the
demesne
at
castle
richmond
then
he
had
intended
absolutely
to
defy
herbert
fitzgerald
but
there
was
no
spirit
of
defiance
now
either
in
his
hand
or
face
or
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
i
am
very
glad
you
have
come
said
he
i
hope
you
understood
that
i
would
have
gone
to
you
only
that
i
thought
it
might
be
better
for
both
of
us
to
be
here
herbert
said
something
to
the
effect
that
he
had
been
quite
willing
to
come
over
to
hap
house
but
he
was
not
at
the
moment
so
as
the
other
and
hardly
knew
how
to
begin
the
subject
which
was
to
be
discussed
between
them
of
course
you
know
that
prendergast
was
here
said
owen
oh
yes
said
herbert
and
somers
also
i
tell
you
fairly
herbert
that
when
somers
came
i
was
not
willing
to
say
much
to
him
what
has
to
be
said
must
be
said
between
you
and
me
and
not
to
any
third
party
i
could
not
open
my
heart
nor
yet
speak
my
thoughts
to
mr
somers
in
answer
to
this
herbert
again
said
that
owen
need
have
no
scruple
in
speaking
to
him
it
is
all
plain
sailing
too
plain
i
fear
said
he
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
now
as
to
the
truth
of
what
prendergast
has
told
you
and
then
having
said
so
much
herbert
waited
for
owen
to
speak
he
herbert
himself
had
little
or
nothing
to
say
castle
richmond
with
its
title
and
acres
was
not
to
be
his
but
was
to
be
the
property
of
this
man
with
whom
he
was
now
sitting
when
that
was
actually
and
positively
understood
between
them
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
said
nothing
as
far
as
herbert
knew
that
other
sorrow
of
his
that
other
and
deeper
sorrow
which
affected
his
mother
name
and
station
as
to
that
he
did
not
find
himself
called
on
to
speak
to
owen
fitzgerald
nor
was
it
necessary
that
he
should
say
anything
as
to
his
great
consolation
the
consolation
which
had
reached
him
from
clara
desmond
and
is
it
true
herbert
asked
owen
at
last
that
my
uncle
is
so
very
ill
in
the
time
of
their
kindly
intercourse
owen
had
always
called
sir
thomas
his
uncle
though
latterly
he
had
ceased
to
do
so
he
is
very
ill
very
ill
indeed
said
herbert
this
was
a
subject
in
which
owen
had
certainly
a
right
to
feel
interested
seeing
that
his
own
investiture
would
follow
immediately
on
the
death
of
sir
thomas
but
herbert
almost
felt
that
the
question
might
as
well
have
been
spared
it
had
been
asked
however
almost
solely
with
the
view
of
gaining
some
few
moments
herbert
he
said
at
last
standing
up
from
his
chair
as
he
made
an
effort
to
begin
his
speech
i
do
know
how
far
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
all
this
news
has
caused
me
great
sorrow
i
grieve
for
your
father
and
your
mother
and
for
you
from
the
very
bottom
of
my
heart
it
is
very
kind
of
you
said
herbert
but
the
blow
has
fallen
and
as
for
myself
i
believe
that
i
can
bear
it
i
do
not
care
so
very
much
about
the
property
nor
do
i
and
now
owen
spoke
rather
louder
and
with
his
own
look
of
strong
impulse
about
his
mouth
and
forehead
nor
do
i
care
so
much
about
the
property
you
were
welcome
to
it
and
are
so
still
i
have
never
coveted
it
from
you
and
do
not
covet
it
it
will
be
yours
now
without
coveting
replied
herbert
and
then
there
was
another
pause
during
which
herbert
sat
still
while
owen
stood
leaning
with
his
back
against
the
mantelpiece
herbert
said
he
after
they
had
thus
remained
silent
for
two
or
three
minutes
i
have
made
up
my
mind
on
this
matter
and
i
will
tell
you
truly
what
i
do
desire
and
what
i
do
not
i
do
not
desire
your
inheritance
but
i
do
desire
that
clara
desmond
shall
be
my
wife
owen
said
the
other
also
getting
up
i
did
not
expect
when
i
came
here
that
you
would
have
spoken
to
me
about
this
it
was
that
we
might
speak
about
this
that
i
asked
you
to
come
here
but
listen
to
me
when
i
say
that
i
want
clara
desmond
to
be
my
wife
i
mean
to
say
that
i
want
that
and
that
only
it
may
be
true
that
i
am
or
shall
be
legally
the
heir
to
your
father
estate
herbert
i
will
relinquish
all
that
because
i
do
not
feel
it
to
be
my
own
i
will
relinquish
it
in
any
way
that
may
separate
myself
from
it
most
thoroughly
but
in
return
do
you
separate
yourself
from
her
who
was
my
own
before
you
had
ever
known
her
and
thus
he
did
make
the
proposition
as
to
which
he
had
been
making
up
his
mind
since
the
morning
on
which
prendergast
had
come
to
him
herbert
for
a
while
was
struck
dumb
with
amazement
not
so
much
at
the
quixotic
generosity
of
the
proposal
as
at
the
singular
mind
of
the
man
in
thinking
that
such
a
plan
could
be
carried
out
best
quality
was
no
doubt
his
sturdy
common
sense
and
that
was
shocked
by
a
suggestion
which
presumed
that
all
the
legalities
and
ordinary
bonds
of
life
could
be
upset
by
such
an
agreement
between
two
young
men
he
knew
that
owen
fitzgerald
could
not
give
away
his
title
to
an
estate
of
fourteen
thousand
a
year
in
this
way
and
that
no
one
could
accept
such
a
gift
were
it
possible
to
be
given
the
estate
and
title
must
belong
to
owen
and
could
not
possibly
belong
to
any
one
else
merely
at
his
word
and
fancy
and
then
again
how
could
the
love
of
a
girl
like
clara
desmond
be
bandied
to
and
fro
at
the
will
of
any
suitor
or
suitors
that
she
had
once
accepted
owen
love
herbert
knew
but
since
that
in
a
soberer
mood
and
with
maturer
judgment
she
had
accepted
his
how
could
he
give
it
up
to
another
or
how
could
that
other
take
possession
of
it
if
so
abandoned
the
bargain
was
one
quite
impossible
to
be
carried
out
and
yet
owen
in
proposing
it
had
fully
intended
to
be
as
good
as
his
word
that
is
impossible
said
herbert
in
a
low
voice
why
impossible
may
i
not
do
what
i
like
with
that
which
is
my
own
it
is
not
impossible
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
property
of
yours
in
fact
it
is
not
my
own
and
i
will
not
take
it
i
will
not
rob
you
of
that
which
you
have
been
born
to
expect
but
in
return
for
this
owen
do
not
talk
of
it
would
you
abandon
a
girl
whom
you
loved
for
any
wealth
or
any
property
you
can
not
love
her
as
i
love
her
i
will
talk
to
you
on
this
matter
openly
as
i
have
never
yet
talked
to
any
one
since
first
i
saw
clara
desmond
the
only
wish
of
my
life
has
been
that
i
might
have
her
for
my
wife
i
have
longed
for
her
as
a
child
longs
if
you
know
what
i
mean
by
that
when
i
saw
that
she
was
old
enough
to
understand
what
love
meant
i
told
her
what
was
in
my
heart
and
she
accepted
my
love
she
swore
to
me
that
she
would
be
mine
let
mother
or
brother
say
what
they
would
as
sure
as
you
are
standing
there
a
living
man
she
loved
me
with
all
truth
and
that
i
loved
her
herbert
i
have
never
loved
aught
but
her
nothing
else
neither
man
nor
woman
nor
wealth
nor
title
all
i
ask
is
that
i
may
have
that
which
was
my
own
but
owen
and
herbert
touched
his
cousin
arm
well
why
do
you
not
speak
i
have
spoken
plainly
enough
it
is
not
easy
to
speak
plainly
on
all
subjects
i
would
not
if
i
could
avoid
it
say
a
word
that
would
hurt
your
feelings
never
mind
my
feelings
speak
out
and
let
us
have
the
truth
in
god
name
my
feelings
have
never
been
much
considered
yet
either
in
this
matter
or
in
any
other
it
seems
to
me
said
herbert
that
the
giving
of
lady
clara
hand
can
not
depend
on
your
will
or
on
mine
you
mean
her
mother
no
by
no
means
her
mother
now
would
be
the
last
to
favour
me
i
mean
herself
if
she
loves
me
as
i
hope
and
believe
nay
am
sure
she
did
love
me
shouted
owen
but
even
if
so
i
do
not
now
say
anything
of
that
but
even
if
so
surely
you
would
not
have
her
marry
you
if
she
does
not
love
you
still
you
would
not
wish
her
to
be
your
wife
if
her
heart
belongs
to
me
it
has
been
given
you
at
her
mother
bidding
however
given
it
is
now
my
own
and
it
can
not
be
returned
look
here
owen
i
will
show
you
her
last
two
letters
if
you
will
allow
me
not
in
pride
i
hope
but
that
you
may
truly
know
what
are
her
wishes
and
he
took
from
his
breast
where
they
had
been
ever
since
he
received
them
the
two
letters
which
clara
had
written
to
him
owen
read
them
both
twice
over
before
he
spoke
first
one
and
then
the
other
and
an
indescribable
look
of
pain
fell
on
his
brow
as
he
did
so
they
were
so
tenderly
worded
so
sweet
so
generous
he
would
have
given
all
the
world
to
have
had
those
letters
addressed
by
her
to
himself
but
even
they
did
not
convince
him
his
heart
had
never
changed
and
he
could
not
believe
that
there
had
been
any
change
in
hers
i
might
have
known
he
said
as
he
gave
them
back
that
she
would
be
too
noble
to
abandon
you
in
your
distress
as
long
as
you
were
rich
i
might
have
had
some
chance
of
getting
her
back
despite
the
machinations
of
her
mother
but
now
that
she
thinks
you
are
poor
and
then
he
stopped
and
hid
his
face
between
his
hands
and
in
what
he
had
last
said
there
was
undoubtedly
something
of
truth
clara
love
for
herbert
had
never
been
passionate
till
passion
had
been
created
by
his
misfortune
and
in
her
thoughts
of
owen
there
had
been
much
of
regret
though
she
had
resolved
to
withdraw
her
love
she
had
not
wholly
ceased
to
love
him
judgment
had
bade
her
to
break
her
word
to
him
and
she
had
obeyed
her
judgment
she
had
admitted
to
herself
that
her
mother
was
right
in
telling
her
that
she
could
not
join
her
own
bankrupt
fortunes
to
the
fortunes
of
one
who
was
both
poor
and
a
spendthrift
and
thus
she
had
plucked
from
her
heart
the
picture
of
the
man
she
had
loved
or
endeavoured
so
to
pluck
it
some
love
for
him
however
had
unwittingly
lingered
there
and
then
herbert
had
come
with
his
suit
a
suitor
fitted
for
her
in
every
way
she
had
not
loved
him
as
she
had
loved
owen
she
had
never
felt
that
she
could
worship
him
and
tremble
at
the
tones
of
his
voice
and
watch
the
glance
of
his
eye
and
gaze
into
his
face
as
though
he
were
half
divine
but
she
acknowledged
his
worth
and
valued
him
she
knew
that
it
behoved
her
to
choose
some
suitor
as
her
husband
and
now
that
her
dream
was
gone
where
could
she
choose
better
than
here
and
thus
herbert
had
been
accepted
he
had
been
accepted
but
the
dream
was
not
wholly
gone
owen
was
in
adversity
ill
spoken
of
by
those
around
her
shunned
by
his
own
relatives
living
darkly
away
from
all
that
is
soft
in
life
and
for
these
reasons
clara
could
not
wholly
forget
her
dream
she
had
in
some
sort
unconsciously
clung
to
her
old
love
till
he
to
whom
she
had
plighted
her
new
troth
was
in
adversity
and
then
all
was
changed
then
her
love
for
herbert
did
become
a
passion
and
then
as
owen
had
become
rich
she
felt
that
she
could
think
of
him
without
remorse
he
was
quite
right
in
perceiving
that
his
chance
was
gone
now
that
herbert
had
ceased
to
be
rich
owen
said
herbert
and
his
voice
was
full
of
tenderness
for
at
this
moment
he
felt
that
he
did
love
and
pity
his
cousin
we
must
each
of
us
bear
the
weight
which
fortune
has
thrown
on
us
it
may
be
that
we
are
neither
of
us
to
be
envied
i
have
lost
all
that
men
generally
value
and
you
i
have
lost
all
on
earth
that
is
valuable
to
me
but
no
it
is
not
lost
not
lost
as
yet
as
long
as
her
name
is
clara
desmond
she
is
as
open
for
me
to
win
as
she
is
for
you
and
herbert
think
of
it
before
you
make
me
your
enemy
see
what
i
offer
you
not
as
a
bargain
mind
you
i
give
up
all
my
title
to
your
father
property
i
will
sign
any
paper
that
your
lawyers
may
bring
to
me
which
may
serve
to
give
you
back
your
inheritance
as
for
me
i
would
scorn
to
take
that
which
belongs
in
justice
to
another
i
will
not
have
your
property
come
what
may
i
will
not
have
it
i
will
give
it
up
to
you
either
as
to
my
enemy
or
as
to
my
friend
i
sincerely
hope
that
we
may
be
friends
but
what
you
say
is
impossible
it
is
not
impossible
i
hereby
pledge
myself
that
i
will
not
take
an
acre
of
your
father
lands
but
i
pledge
myself
also
that
i
will
always
be
your
enemy
if
clara
desmond
becomes
your
wife
and
i
mean
what
i
say
i
have
set
my
heart
on
one
thing
and
on
one
thing
only
and
if
i
am
ruined
in
that
i
am
ruined
indeed
herbert
remained
silent
for
he
had
nothing
further
that
he
knew
how
to
plead
he
felt
as
other
men
would
feel
that
each
of
them
must
keep
that
which
fate
had
given
him
fate
had
decreed
that
owen
should
be
the
heir
to
castle
richmond
and
the
decree
thus
gone
forth
must
stand
valid
and
fate
had
also
decreed
that
owen
should
be
rejected
by
clara
desmond
which
other
decree
as
herbert
thought
must
be
held
as
valid
also
but
he
had
no
further
inclination
to
argue
upon
the
subject
his
cousin
was
becoming
hot
and
angry
and
herbert
was
beginning
to
wish
that
he
was
on
his
way
home
that
he
might
be
once
more
at
his
father
bedside
or
in
his
mother
room
comforting
her
and
being
comforted
well
said
owen
after
a
while
in
his
voice
what
do
you
say
to
my
offer
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
we
must
each
take
our
own
course
as
for
me
i
have
lost
everything
but
one
thing
and
it
is
not
likely
that
i
shall
throw
that
away
from
me
nor
so
help
me
heaven
in
my
need
will
i
let
that
thing
be
filched
from
me
i
have
offered
you
kindness
and
brotherly
love
and
wealth
and
all
that
friendship
could
do
for
a
man
give
me
my
way
in
this
and
i
will
be
to
you
such
a
comrade
and
such
a
brother
should
i
be
a
man
owen
were
i
to
give
up
this
be
a
man
yes
it
is
pride
on
your
part
you
do
not
love
her
you
have
never
loved
her
as
i
have
loved
you
have
not
sat
apart
long
months
and
months
thinking
of
her
as
i
have
done
from
the
time
she
was
a
child
i
marked
her
as
my
own
as
god
will
help
me
when
i
die
she
is
all
that
i
have
coveted
in
this
world
all
but
her
i
have
coveted
with
such
longings
of
the
heart
that
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
live
without
her
nor
will
i
and
then
again
they
both
were
silent
it
may
be
as
well
that
we
should
part
now
said
herbert
at
last
i
do
not
know
that
we
can
gain
anything
by
further
talking
on
this
subject
well
you
know
that
best
but
i
have
one
further
question
to
ask
you
what
is
it
owen
you
still
think
of
marrying
clara
desmond
certainly
of
course
i
think
of
it
and
when
i
presume
you
are
not
so
as
to
be
afraid
of
speaking
out
openly
what
you
intend
to
do
i
can
not
say
when
i
had
hoped
that
it
would
have
been
very
soon
but
all
this
will
of
course
delay
it
it
may
be
years
first
these
last
were
the
only
pleasant
words
that
owen
had
heard
if
there
were
to
be
a
delay
of
years
might
not
his
chance
still
be
as
good
as
herbert
but
then
this
delay
was
to
be
the
consequence
of
his
cousin
ruined
prospects
and
the
accomplishment
of
that
ruin
owen
had
pledged
himself
to
prevent
was
he
by
his
own
deed
to
enable
his
enemy
to
take
that
very
step
which
he
was
so
firmly
resolved
to
prevent
you
will
give
me
your
promise
said
he
that
you
will
not
marry
her
for
the
next
three
years
make
me
that
promise
and
i
will
make
you
the
same
herbert
felt
that
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
his
now
marrying
within
the
time
named
but
nevertheless
he
would
not
bring
himself
to
make
such
a
promise
as
this
he
would
make
no
bargain
about
clara
desmond
about
his
clara
which
could
in
any
way
admit
a
doubt
as
to
his
own
right
had
owen
asked
him
to
promise
that
he
would
not
marry
her
during
the
next
week
he
would
have
given
no
such
pledge
no
said
he
i
can
not
promise
that
she
is
now
only
seventeen
it
does
not
matter
i
will
make
no
such
promise
because
on
such
a
subject
you
have
no
right
to
ask
for
any
when
she
will
consent
to
run
her
risk
of
happiness
in
coming
to
me
then
i
shall
marry
her
owen
was
now
walking
up
and
down
the
room
with
rapid
steps
you
have
not
the
courage
to
fight
me
fairly
said
he
i
do
not
wish
to
fight
you
at
all
ah
but
you
must
fight
me
shall
i
see
the
prey
taken
out
of
my
jaws
and
not
struggle
for
it
no
by
heavens
you
must
fight
me
and
i
tell
you
fairly
that
the
fight
shall
be
as
hard
as
i
can
make
it
i
have
offered
you
that
which
one
living
man
is
seldom
able
to
offer
to
another
money
and
land
and
wealth
and
station
all
these
things
i
throw
away
from
me
because
i
feel
that
they
should
be
yours
and
i
ask
only
in
return
the
love
of
a
young
girl
i
ask
that
because
i
feel
that
it
should
be
mine
if
it
has
gone
from
me
which
i
do
not
believe
it
has
been
filched
and
stolen
by
a
thief
in
the
night
she
did
love
me
if
a
girl
ever
loved
a
man
but
she
was
separated
from
me
and
i
bore
that
patiently
because
i
trusted
her
but
she
was
young
and
weak
and
her
mother
was
strong
and
crafty
she
has
accepted
you
at
her
mother
instance
and
were
i
base
enough
to
keep
from
you
your
father
inheritance
her
mother
would
no
more
give
her
to
you
now
than
she
would
to
me
then
this
is
true
and
if
you
know
it
to
be
true
as
you
do
know
you
will
be
mean
and
dastard
and
a
coward
you
will
be
no
fitzgerald
if
you
keep
from
me
that
which
i
have
a
right
to
claim
as
my
own
not
fight
ay
but
you
must
fight
we
can
not
both
live
here
in
this
country
if
clara
desmond
become
your
wife
mark
my
words
if
that
take
place
you
and
i
can
not
live
here
alongside
of
each
other
houses
he
paused
for
a
moment
after
this
and
then
added
you
can
go
now
if
you
will
for
i
have
said
out
my
say
and
herbert
did
go
almost
without
uttering
a
word
of
adieu
what
could
he
say
in
answer
to
such
threats
as
these
that
his
cousin
was
in
every
way
unreasonable
as
unreasonable
in
his
generosity
as
he
was
in
his
claims
he
felt
convinced
but
an
unreasonable
man
though
he
is
one
whom
one
would
fain
conquer
by
arguments
were
it
possible
is
the
very
man
on
whom
arguments
have
no
avail
a
madman
is
mad
because
he
is
mad
herbert
had
a
great
deal
that
was
very
sensible
to
allege
in
favour
of
his
views
but
what
use
of
alleging
anything
of
sense
to
such
a
mind
as
that
of
owen
fitzgerald
so
he
went
his
way
without
further
speech
when
he
was
gone
owen
for
a
time
went
on
walking
his
room
and
then
sank
again
into
his
chair
abominably
irrational
as
his
method
of
arranging
all
these
family
difficulties
will
no
doubt
seem
to
all
who
may
read
of
it
to
him
it
had
appeared
not
only
an
easy
but
a
happy
mode
of
bringing
back
contentment
to
everybody
he
was
quite
serious
in
his
intention
of
giving
up
his
position
as
heir
to
castle
richmond
prendergast
had
explained
to
him
that
the
property
was
entailed
as
far
as
him
but
no
farther
and
had
done
this
doubtless
with
the
view
not
then
expressed
to
some
friendly
arrangement
by
which
a
small
portion
of
the
property
might
be
saved
and
restored
to
the
children
of
sir
thomas
but
owen
had
looked
at
it
quite
in
another
light
he
had
in
justice
no
right
to
inquire
into
all
those
circumstances
of
his
old
cousin
marriage
such
a
union
was
a
marriage
in
the
eye
of
god
and
should
be
held
as
such
by
him
he
would
take
no
advantage
of
so
terrible
an
accident
he
would
take
no
advantage
so
he
said
to
himself
over
and
over
again
but
yet
as
he
said
it
he
resolved
that
he
would
take
advantage
he
would
not
touch
the
estate
but
surely
if
he
abstained
from
touching
it
herbert
would
be
generous
enough
to
leave
to
him
the
solace
of
his
love
and
he
had
no
scruple
in
allotting
to
clara
the
poorer
husband
instead
of
the
richer
he
was
no
poorer
now
than
when
she
had
accepted
him
looking
at
it
in
that
light
had
he
not
a
right
to
claim
that
she
should
abide
by
her
first
acceptance
could
any
one
be
found
to
justify
the
theory
that
a
girl
may
throw
over
a
poor
lover
because
a
rich
lover
comes
in
the
way
owen
had
his
own
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
ideas
which
were
not
without
a
basis
of
strong
rugged
justice
and
nothing
could
be
more
antagonistic
to
them
than
such
a
doctrine
as
this
and
then
he
still
believed
in
his
heart
that
he
was
dearer
to
clara
than
that
other
richer
suitor
he
heard
of
her
from
time
to
time
and
those
who
had
spoken
to
him
had
spoken
of
her
as
pining
for
love
of
him
in
this
there
had
been
much
of
the
flattery
of
servants
and
something
of
the
subservience
of
those
about
him
who
wished
to
stand
well
in
his
graces
but
he
had
believed
it
he
was
not
a
conceited
man
nor
even
a
vain
man
he
did
not
think
himself
more
clever
than
his
cousin
and
as
for
personal
appearance
it
was
a
matter
to
which
his
thoughts
never
descended
but
he
had
about
him
a
and
assurance
in
his
own
manhood
which
forbade
him
to
doubt
the
love
of
one
who
had
told
him
that
she
loved
him
and
he
did
not
believe
in
herbert
love
his
cousin
was
as
he
thought
of
a
calibre
too
cold
for
love
that
clara
was
valued
by
him
owen
did
not
doubt
valued
for
her
beauty
for
her
rank
for
her
grace
and
peerless
manner
but
what
had
such
value
as
that
to
do
with
love
would
herbert
sacrifice
everything
for
clara
desmond
would
he
bid
pelion
fall
on
ossa
would
he
drink
up
esil
all
this
would
owen
do
and
more
he
would
do
more
than
any
laertes
had
ever
dreamed
he
would
give
up
for
now
and
for
ever
all
title
to
those
rich
lands
which
made
the
fitzgeralds
of
castle
richmond
the
men
of
greatest
mark
in
all
their
county
and
thus
he
fanned
himself
into
a
fury
as
he
thought
of
his
want
of
generosity
herbert
would
be
the
heir
and
because
he
was
the
heir
he
would
be
the
favoured
lover
but
there
might
yet
be
time
and
opportunity
and
at
any
rate
clara
should
not
marry
without
knowing
what
was
the
whole
truth
herbert
was
ungenerous
but
clara
still
might
be
just
if
not
then
as
he
had
said
before
he
would
fight
out
the
battle
to
the
end
as
with
an
enemy
herbert
when
he
got
on
to
his
horse
to
ride
home
was
forced
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
no
good
whatever
had
come
from
his
visit
to
hap
house
words
had
been
spoken
which
might
have
been
much
better
left
unspoken
an
angry
man
will
often
cling
to
his
anger
because
his
anger
has
been
spoken
he
will
do
evil
because
he
has
threatened
evil
and
is
ashamed
to
be
better
than
his
words
and
there
was
no
comfort
to
be
derived
from
those
lavish
promises
made
by
owen
with
regard
to
the
property
to
herbert
mind
they
were
mere
moonshine
very
graceful
on
the
part
of
the
maker
but
meaning
nothing
no
one
could
have
castle
richmond
but
him
who
owned
it
legally
owen
fitzgerald
would
become
sir
owen
and
would
as
a
matter
of
course
be
sir
owen
of
castle
richmond
there
was
no
comfort
on
that
score
and
then
on
that
other
score
there
was
so
much
discomfort
of
giving
up
his
bride
herbert
never
for
a
moment
thought
but
he
did
think
with
increasing
annoyance
of
the
angry
threats
which
had
been
pronounced
against
him
when
he
rode
into
the
as
was
his
wont
he
found
richard
waiting
for
him
this
was
not
customary
as
in
these
latter
days
richard
though
he
always
drove
the
car
as
a
sort
of
subsidiary
coachman
to
the
young
ladies
to
whom
the
car
was
supposed
to
belong
in
fee
did
not
act
as
general
groom
he
had
been
promoted
beyond
this
and
was
a
sort
of
about
the
house
half
indoor
servant
and
half
out
doing
very
much
what
he
liked
and
giving
advice
to
everybody
from
the
cook
downwards
he
thanked
god
that
he
knew
his
place
he
would
often
say
but
nobody
else
knew
it
nevertheless
everybody
liked
him
even
the
poor
housemaid
whom
he
snubbed
is
anything
the
matter
asked
herbert
looking
at
the
face
an
there
is
herbert
sir
thomas
is
my
father
is
not
dead
exclaimed
herbert
oh
no
herbert
it
not
so
bad
as
that
but
he
is
very
failing
very
failing
my
lady
is
with
him
now
herbert
ran
into
the
house
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
chief
stairs
he
met
one
of
his
sisters
who
had
heard
the
steps
of
his
horse
oh
herbert
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
said
she
her
eyes
and
cheeks
were
red
with
tears
and
her
hand
as
her
brother
took
it
was
cold
and
numbed
what
is
it
mary
is
he
worse
oh
so
much
worse
mamma
and
emmeline
are
there
he
has
asked
for
you
three
or
four
times
and
always
says
that
he
is
dying
i
had
better
go
up
and
say
that
you
are
here
and
what
does
my
mother
think
of
it
she
has
never
left
him
and
therefore
i
can
not
tell
but
i
know
from
her
face
that
she
thinks
that
he
is
dying
shall
i
go
up
herbert
and
so
she
went
and
herbert
following
softly
on
his
toes
stood
in
the
corridor
outside
the
waiting
till
his
arrival
should
have
been
announced
it
was
but
a
minute
and
then
his
sister
returning
to
the
door
summoned
him
to
enter
the
room
had
been
nearly
darkened
but
as
there
were
no
curtains
to
the
bed
herbert
could
see
his
mother
face
as
she
knelt
on
a
stool
at
the
bedside
his
father
was
turned
away
from
him
and
lay
with
his
hand
inside
his
wife
and
emmeline
was
sitting
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
her
face
between
her
hands
striving
to
stifle
her
sobs
here
is
herbert
now
dearest
said
lady
fitzgerald
with
a
low
soft
voice
almost
a
whisper
yet
clear
enough
to
cause
no
effort
in
the
hearing
i
knew
that
he
would
not
be
long
and
herbert
obeying
the
signal
of
his
mother
eye
passed
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
father
said
he
are
you
not
so
well
my
poor
boy
my
poor
ruined
boy
said
the
dying
man
hardly
articulating
the
words
as
he
dropped
his
wife
hand
and
took
that
of
his
son
herbert
found
that
it
was
wet
and
clammy
and
cold
and
almost
powerless
in
its
feeble
grasp
dearest
father
you
are
wrong
if
you
let
that
trouble
you
all
that
will
never
trouble
me
is
it
not
well
that
a
man
should
earn
his
own
bread
is
it
not
the
lot
of
all
good
men
but
still
the
old
man
murmured
with
his
broken
voice
my
poor
boy
my
poor
boy
the
hopes
and
aspirations
of
his
eldest
son
are
as
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
to
an
englishman
who
has
been
born
to
land
and
fortune
what
had
not
this
poor
man
endured
in
order
that
his
son
might
be
sir
herbert
fitzgerald
of
castle
richmond
but
this
was
no
longer
possible
and
from
the
moment
that
this
had
been
brought
home
to
him
the
father
had
felt
that
for
him
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
die
my
poor
boy
he
muttered
tell
me
that
you
have
forgiven
me
and
then
they
all
knelt
round
the
bed
and
prayed
with
him
and
afterwards
they
tried
to
comfort
him
telling
him
how
good
he
had
been
to
them
and
his
wife
whispered
in
his
ear
that
if
there
had
been
fault
the
fault
was
hers
but
that
her
conscience
told
her
that
such
fault
had
been
forgiven
and
while
she
said
this
she
motioned
the
children
away
from
him
and
strove
to
make
him
understand
that
human
misery
could
never
kill
the
soul
and
should
never
utterly
depress
the
spirit
dearest
love
she
said
still
whispering
to
him
in
her
low
sweet
voice
so
dear
to
him
but
utterly
inaudible
beyond
if
you
would
cease
to
accuse
yourself
so
bitterly
you
might
yet
be
better
and
remain
with
us
to
comfort
us
but
the
slender
man
whose
arms
are
without
muscles
and
whose
back
is
without
pith
will
strive
in
vain
to
lift
the
weight
which
the
brawny
vigour
of
another
tosses
from
the
ground
almost
without
an
effort
it
is
with
the
mind
and
the
spirit
as
with
the
body
only
this
that
the
muscles
of
the
body
can
be
measured
but
not
so
those
of
the
spirit
lady
fitzgerald
was
made
of
other
stuff
than
sir
thomas
and
that
which
to
her
had
cost
an
effort
but
with
an
effort
had
been
done
surely
was
to
him
as
impossible
as
the
labour
of
hercules
my
poor
boy
my
poor
ruined
boy
he
still
muttered
as
she
strove
to
comfort
him
mamma
has
sent
for
townsend
emmeline
whispered
to
her
brother
as
they
stood
together
in
the
bow
of
the
window
and
do
you
really
think
he
is
so
bad
as
that
i
am
sure
that
mamma
does
i
believe
he
had
some
sort
of
a
fit
before
you
came
at
any
rate
he
did
not
speak
for
two
hours
and
was
not
finucane
here
finucane
was
the
mallow
doctor
yes
but
he
had
left
before
papa
became
so
much
worse
mamma
has
sent
for
him
also
but
i
do
not
know
that
it
boots
to
dally
longer
in
a
dying
chamber
it
is
an
axiom
of
old
that
the
stage
curtain
should
be
drawn
before
the
inexorable
one
enters
in
upon
his
final
work
doctor
finucane
did
come
but
his
coming
was
all
in
vain
sir
thomas
had
known
that
it
was
in
vain
and
so
also
had
his
patient
wife
there
was
that
mind
diseased
towards
the
cure
of
which
no
doctor
finucane
could
make
any
possible
approach
and
townsend
came
also
let
us
hope
not
in
vain
though
the
cure
which
he
fain
would
have
perfected
can
hardly
be
effected
in
such
moments
as
those
let
us
hope
that
it
had
been
already
effected
the
only
crying
sin
which
we
can
lay
to
the
charge
of
the
dying
man
is
that
of
which
we
have
spoken
he
had
endeavoured
by
pensioning
falsehood
and
fraud
to
preserve
for
his
wife
her
name
and
for
his
son
that
son
inheritance
even
over
this
deep
as
it
was
the
recording
angel
may
have
dropped
some
cleansing
tears
of
pity
that
night
the
poor
man
died
and
the
fitzgeralds
who
sat
in
the
chambers
of
castle
richmond
were
no
longer
the
owners
of
the
mansion
there
was
no
speech
of
sir
herbert
among
the
servants
as
there
would
have
been
had
these
tidings
not
have
reached
them
finucane
had
remained
in
the
house
and
even
he
in
speaking
of
the
son
had
shown
that
he
knew
the
story
they
were
strangers
there
now
as
they
all
knew
intruders
as
they
would
soon
be
considered
in
the
house
of
their
cousin
owen
or
rather
not
their
cousin
in
that
he
was
above
them
by
right
of
his
blood
they
had
no
right
to
claim
him
as
their
relation
it
may
be
said
that
at
such
a
moment
all
this
should
not
have
been
thought
of
but
those
who
say
so
know
little
as
i
imagine
of
the
true
effect
of
sorrow
no
wife
and
no
children
ever
grieved
more
heartily
for
a
father
but
their
grief
was
blacker
and
more
gloomy
in
that
they
knew
that
they
were
outcasts
in
the
world
and
during
that
long
night
as
herbert
and
his
sisters
sat
up
cowering
round
the
fire
he
told
them
of
all
that
had
been
said
at
hap
house
and
can
it
not
be
as
he
says
mary
had
asked
and
that
herbert
should
give
up
his
wife
said
emmeline
no
but
that
other
thing
do
not
dream
of
it
said
herbert
it
is
all
all
impossible
the
house
that
we
are
now
in
belongs
to
sir
owen
fitzgerald
chapter
xxxi
the
first
month
and
now
i
will
beg
my
readers
to
suppose
a
month
to
have
passed
by
since
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
died
it
was
a
busy
month
in
ireland
it
may
probably
be
said
that
so
large
a
sum
of
money
had
never
been
circulated
in
the
country
in
any
one
month
since
money
had
been
known
there
and
yet
it
may
also
be
said
that
so
frightful
a
mortality
had
never
occurred
there
from
the
want
of
that
which
money
brings
it
was
well
understood
by
all
men
now
that
the
customary
food
of
the
country
had
disappeared
there
was
no
longer
any
difference
of
opinion
between
rich
and
poor
between
protestant
and
roman
catholic
as
to
that
no
man
dared
now
to
say
that
the
poor
if
left
to
themselves
could
feed
themselves
or
to
allege
that
the
sufferings
of
the
country
arose
from
the
machinations
of
speculators
the
famine
was
an
established
fact
and
all
men
knew
that
it
was
doing
all
men
knew
this
though
few
could
recognize
as
yet
with
how
much
mercy
god
hand
was
stretched
out
over
the
country
or
may
it
not
perhaps
be
truer
to
say
that
in
such
matters
there
is
no
such
thing
as
mercy
no
special
mercies
no
other
mercy
than
that
fatherly
forbearing
perfect
goodness
by
which
the
creator
is
ever
adapting
this
world
to
the
wants
of
his
creatures
and
rectifying
the
evils
arising
from
their
faults
and
follies
quo
musa
tendis
such
discourses
of
the
gods
as
these
are
not
to
be
fitly
handled
in
such
small
measures
at
any
rate
there
was
the
famine
undoubted
now
by
any
one
and
death
who
in
visiting
castle
richmond
may
be
said
to
have
knocked
at
the
towers
of
a
king
was
busy
enough
also
among
the
cabins
of
the
poor
and
now
the
great
fault
of
those
who
were
the
most
affected
was
becoming
one
which
would
not
have
been
at
first
sight
expected
one
would
think
that
starving
men
would
become
violent
taking
food
by
open
theft
feeling
and
perhaps
not
without
some
truth
that
the
agony
of
their
want
robbed
such
robberies
of
its
sin
but
such
was
by
no
means
the
case
i
only
remember
one
instance
in
which
the
shops
were
attacked
and
in
that
instance
the
work
was
done
by
those
who
were
undergoing
no
real
suffering
at
clonmel
in
tipperary
the
bread
was
one
morning
stripped
away
from
the
bakers
shops
but
at
that
time
and
in
that
place
there
was
nothing
approaching
to
famine
the
fault
of
the
people
was
apathy
it
was
the
feeling
of
the
multitude
that
the
world
and
all
that
was
good
in
it
was
passing
away
from
them
that
exertion
was
useless
and
hope
hopeless
ah
me
your
honour
said
a
man
to
me
there
never
be
a
bit
and
a
sup
again
in
the
county
cork
the
life
of
the
world
is
fairly
gone
and
it
was
very
hard
to
repress
this
feeling
the
energy
of
a
man
depends
so
much
on
the
outward
circumstances
that
encumber
him
it
is
so
hard
to
work
when
work
seems
hopeless
so
hard
to
trust
where
the
basis
of
our
faith
is
so
far
removed
from
sight
when
large
tracts
of
land
went
out
of
cultivation
was
it
not
natural
to
think
that
agriculture
was
receding
from
the
country
leaving
the
green
hills
once
more
to
be
brown
and
barren
as
hills
once
green
have
become
in
other
countries
and
when
men
were
falling
in
the
highways
and
women
would
sit
with
their
babes
in
their
arms
listless
till
death
should
come
to
them
was
it
not
natural
to
think
that
death
was
making
a
huge
success
that
he
the
inexorable
one
was
now
the
inexorable
indeed
there
were
greatly
trusting
hearts
that
could
withstand
the
weight
of
this
terrible
pressure
and
thinking
minds
which
saw
that
good
would
come
out
of
this
great
evil
but
such
hearts
and
such
minds
were
not
to
be
looked
for
among
the
suffering
poor
and
were
not
perhaps
often
found
even
among
those
who
were
not
poor
or
suffering
it
was
very
hard
to
be
thus
trusting
and
thoughtful
while
everything
around
was
full
of
awe
and
agony
the
people
however
were
conscious
of
god
work
and
were
becoming
dull
and
apathetic
they
clustered
about
the
roads
working
lazily
while
their
strength
lasted
them
and
afterwards
when
strength
failed
them
for
this
they
clustered
more
largely
in
the
and
in
every
town
in
every
assemblage
of
houses
which
in
england
would
be
called
a
village
there
was
a
any
big
barrack
of
a
tenement
that
could
be
obtained
at
a
moment
notice
whatever
the
rent
became
a
in
the
course
of
twelve
hours
in
twelve
nay
in
two
hours
what
was
necessary
but
the
bare
walls
and
a
supply
of
yellow
meal
bad
provision
this
for
all
a
man
wants
as
was
said
often
enough
by
irrational
philanthropists
but
better
provision
than
no
shelter
and
no
yellow
meal
it
was
bad
that
men
should
be
locked
up
at
night
without
any
of
the
appliances
of
decency
bad
that
they
should
be
herded
together
for
day
after
day
with
no
resource
but
the
eating
twice
a
day
of
enough
unsavoury
food
to
keep
life
and
soul
together
very
bad
ye
philanthropical
irrationalists
but
is
not
a
choice
of
evils
all
that
is
left
to
us
in
many
a
contingency
was
not
even
this
better
than
that
life
and
soul
should
be
allowed
to
part
without
any
effort
at
preserving
their
union
and
thus
life
and
soul
were
kept
together
the
government
of
the
day
having
wisely
seen
what
at
so
short
a
notice
was
possible
for
them
to
do
and
what
was
absolutely
impossible
it
is
in
such
emergencies
as
these
that
the
watching
and
the
wisdom
of
a
government
are
necessary
and
i
shall
always
think
as
i
did
think
then
that
the
wisdom
of
its
action
and
the
wisdom
of
its
abstinence
from
action
were
very
good
and
now
again
the
fields
in
ireland
are
green
and
the
markets
are
busy
and
money
is
chucked
to
and
fro
like
a
weathercock
which
the
players
do
not
wish
to
have
abiding
with
them
and
the
tardy
speculator
going
over
to
look
for
a
bit
of
land
comes
back
muttering
angrily
that
fancy
prices
are
demanded
they
run
you
up
to
years
purchase
says
the
tardy
speculator
thinking
as
it
seems
that
he
is
specially
ill
used
agricultural
wages
have
been
nearly
doubled
in
ireland
during
the
last
fifteen
years
think
of
that
master
brook
work
for
which
at
six
shillings
a
week
there
would
be
a
hundred
hungry
claimants
in
in
the
good
old
days
before
the
famine
when
repeal
was
so
immediately
expected
will
now
fetch
ten
shillings
the
claimants
being
by
no
means
numerous
in
and
i
knew
men
to
work
for
fourpence
a
day
something
over
the
dole
on
which
we
are
told
being
mostly
incredulous
as
we
hear
it
that
a
coolie
labourer
can
feed
himself
with
rice
in
india
not
one
man
or
two
men
the
broken
down
incapables
of
the
parish
but
the
best
labour
of
the
country
one
and
twopence
is
now
about
the
cheapest
rate
at
which
a
man
can
be
hired
for
agricultural
purposes
while
this
is
so
and
while
the
prices
are
progressing
there
is
no
cause
for
fear
let
bishops
a
and
b
and
archbishops
c
and
d
fret
and
fume
with
never
so
great
vexation
touching
the
clipped
honours
of
their
father
the
pope
but
again
quo
musa
tendis
i
could
write
on
this
subject
for
a
week
were
it
not
that
rhadamanthus
awaits
me
rhadamanthus
the
critic
and
rhadamanthus
is
of
all
things
impatient
of
an
episode
life
and
soul
were
kept
together
in
those
terrible
days
that
is
the
irish
life
and
soul
generally
there
were
many
slips
in
which
the
union
was
violently
dissolved
many
cases
in
which
the
yellow
meal
allowed
was
not
sufficient
or
in
which
it
did
not
reach
the
sufferer
in
time
to
prevent
such
dissolution
cases
which
when
numbered
together
amounted
to
thousands
and
then
the
pestilence
came
taking
its
victims
by
tens
of
thousands
but
that
was
after
the
time
with
which
we
shall
have
concern
here
and
immigration
followed
taking
those
who
were
saved
by
hundreds
of
thousands
but
the
millions
are
still
there
a
thriving
people
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
during
this
month
the
month
ensuing
upon
the
death
of
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
herbert
could
of
course
pay
no
outward
attention
to
the
wants
or
relief
of
the
people
he
could
make
no
offer
of
assistance
for
nothing
belonged
to
him
nor
could
he
aid
in
the
councils
of
the
committees
for
no
one
could
have
defined
the
position
of
the
speaker
and
during
that
month
nothing
was
defined
about
castle
richmond
lady
fitzgerald
was
still
always
called
by
her
title
the
people
of
the
country
including
the
tradesmen
of
the
neighbouring
towns
addressed
the
owner
of
hap
house
as
sir
owen
and
gradually
the
name
was
working
itself
into
common
use
though
he
had
taken
no
steps
to
make
himself
legally
entitled
to
wear
it
but
no
one
spoke
of
sir
herbert
the
story
was
so
generally
known
that
none
were
so
ignorant
as
to
suppose
him
to
be
his
father
heir
the
servants
about
the
place
still
called
him
herbert
orders
to
that
effect
having
been
specially
given
and
the
peasants
of
the
country
with
that
tact
which
graces
them
and
with
that
anxiety
to
abstain
from
giving
pain
which
always
accompanies
them
unless
when
angered
carefully
called
him
by
no
name
they
knew
that
he
was
not
sir
herbert
but
they
would
not
believe
but
what
perchance
he
might
be
so
yet
on
some
future
day
so
they
took
off
their
old
hats
to
him
and
passed
him
silently
in
his
sorrow
or
if
they
spoke
to
him
addressed
his
honour
simply
omitting
all
mention
of
that
christian
name
which
the
poor
irishman
is
generally
so
fond
of
using
mister
blake
sounds
cold
and
unkindly
in
his
ears
it
is
the
masther
or
his
honour
or
if
possible
misther
thady
or
if
there
be
any
handle
that
is
used
with
avidity
pat
is
a
happy
man
when
he
can
address
his
landlord
as
sir
patrick
but
now
the
ould
masther
son
could
be
called
by
no
name
men
knew
not
what
he
was
to
be
though
they
knew
well
that
he
was
not
that
which
he
ought
to
be
and
there
were
some
who
attempted
to
worship
owen
as
the
rising
sun
but
for
such
of
them
as
had
never
worshipped
him
before
that
game
was
rather
hopeless
in
those
days
he
was
not
much
seen
neither
hunting
nor
entertaining
company
but
when
seen
he
was
rough
enough
with
those
who
made
any
deep
attempt
to
ingratiate
themselves
with
his
coming
mightiness
and
during
this
month
he
went
over
to
london
having
been
specially
invited
so
to
do
by
prendergast
but
very
little
came
of
his
visit
there
except
that
it
was
certified
to
him
that
he
was
beyond
all
doubt
the
baronet
and
there
shall
be
no
unnecessary
delay
sir
owen
said
prendergast
in
putting
you
into
full
possession
of
all
your
rights
in
answer
to
which
owen
had
replied
that
he
was
not
anxious
to
be
put
in
possession
of
any
rights
that
as
far
as
any
active
doing
of
his
own
was
concerned
the
title
might
lie
in
abeyance
and
that
regarding
the
property
he
would
make
known
his
wish
to
prendergast
very
quickly
after
his
return
to
ireland
but
he
intimated
at
the
same
time
that
there
could
be
no
ground
for
disturbing
lady
fitzgerald
as
he
had
no
intention
under
any
circumstances
of
living
at
castle
richmond
had
you
not
better
tell
lady
fitzgerald
that
yourself
said
prendergast
catching
at
the
idea
that
his
friend
widow
my
readers
will
allow
me
so
to
call
her
might
be
allowed
to
live
undisturbed
at
the
family
mansion
if
not
for
life
at
any
rate
for
a
few
years
if
this
young
man
were
so
generous
why
should
it
not
be
so
he
would
not
want
the
big
house
at
any
rate
till
he
were
married
it
would
be
better
that
you
should
say
so
said
owen
i
have
particular
reasons
for
not
wishing
to
go
there
but
allow
me
to
say
my
dear
young
friend
and
i
hope
i
may
call
you
so
for
i
greatly
admire
the
way
in
which
you
have
taken
all
these
tidings
that
i
would
venture
to
advise
you
to
drop
the
remembrance
of
any
unpleasantness
that
may
have
existed
you
should
now
feel
yourself
to
be
the
closest
friend
of
that
family
so
i
would
if
and
then
owen
stopped
short
though
prendergast
gave
him
plenty
of
time
to
finish
his
sentence
were
he
minded
to
do
so
in
your
present
position
continued
the
lawyer
your
influence
will
be
very
great
i
ca
explain
it
all
said
owen
but
i
do
think
my
influence
will
be
great
at
all
and
what
is
more
i
do
not
want
any
influence
of
that
sort
i
wish
lady
fitzgerald
to
understand
that
she
is
at
perfect
liberty
to
stay
where
she
is
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
not
as
a
favour
from
me
mind
for
i
do
not
think
that
she
would
take
a
favour
from
my
hands
but
my
dear
sir
therefore
you
had
better
write
to
her
about
remaining
there
prendergast
did
write
to
her
or
rather
to
herbert
but
in
doing
so
he
thought
it
right
to
say
that
the
permission
to
live
at
castle
richmond
should
be
regarded
as
a
kindness
granted
them
by
their
relative
it
is
a
kindness
which
under
the
circumstances
your
mother
may
i
think
accept
without
compunction
at
any
rate
for
some
time
to
come
till
she
shall
have
suited
herself
without
hurrying
her
choice
but
nevertheless
it
must
be
regarded
as
a
generous
offer
on
his
part
and
i
do
hope
my
dear
herbert
that
you
and
he
will
be
fast
friends
but
prendergast
did
not
in
the
least
comprehend
the
workings
of
owen
mind
and
herbert
who
knew
more
of
them
than
any
one
else
did
not
understand
them
altogether
owen
had
no
idea
of
granting
any
favour
to
his
relatives
who
as
he
thought
had
never
granted
any
to
him
what
owen
wanted
or
what
he
told
himself
that
he
wanted
was
justice
it
was
his
duty
as
a
just
man
to
abstain
from
taking
hold
of
those
acres
and
he
was
prepared
to
do
his
duty
but
it
was
equally
herbert
duty
as
a
just
man
to
abstain
from
taking
hold
of
clara
desmond
and
he
was
resolved
that
he
would
never
be
herbert
friend
if
herbert
did
not
perform
that
duty
and
then
though
he
felt
himself
bound
to
give
up
the
acres
though
he
did
regard
this
as
an
imperative
duty
he
nevertheless
felt
also
that
something
was
due
to
him
for
his
readiness
to
perform
such
a
duty
that
some
reward
should
be
conceded
to
him
what
this
reward
was
to
be
or
rather
what
he
wished
it
to
be
we
all
know
herbert
had
utterly
refused
to
engage
in
any
such
negotiation
but
owen
nevertheless
would
not
cease
to
think
that
something
might
yet
be
done
who
was
so
generous
as
clara
and
would
not
clara
herself
speak
out
if
she
knew
how
much
her
old
lover
was
prepared
to
do
for
this
newer
lover
half
a
dozen
times
owen
made
up
his
mind
to
explain
the
whole
thing
to
prendergast
but
when
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
lawyer
he
could
not
talk
about
love
young
men
are
so
apt
to
think
that
their
seniors
in
age
can
not
understand
romance
or
acknowledge
the
force
of
a
passion
but
here
they
are
wrong
for
there
would
be
as
much
romance
after
forty
as
before
i
take
it
were
it
not
checked
by
the
fear
of
ridicule
so
owen
stayed
a
week
in
london
seeing
prendergast
every
day
and
then
he
returned
to
hap
house
in
the
mean
time
life
went
on
at
a
very
sad
pace
at
desmond
court
there
was
no
concord
whatever
between
the
two
ladies
residing
there
the
mother
was
silent
gloomy
and
sometimes
bitter
seldom
saying
a
word
about
herbert
fitzgerald
or
his
prospects
but
saying
that
word
with
great
fixity
of
purpose
when
it
was
spoken
no
one
she
said
should
attribute
to
her
the
poverty
and
misery
of
her
child
that
marriage
should
not
take
place
from
her
house
or
with
her
consent
and
clara
for
the
most
part
was
silent
also
in
answer
to
such
words
as
the
above
she
would
say
nothing
but
when
as
did
happen
once
or
twice
she
was
forced
to
speak
she
declared
openly
enough
that
no
earthly
consideration
should
induce
her
to
give
up
her
engagement
and
then
the
young
earl
came
home
brought
away
from
his
school
in
order
that
his
authority
might
have
effect
on
his
sister
to
speak
the
truth
he
was
unwilling
enough
to
interfere
and
would
have
declined
to
come
at
all
could
he
have
dared
to
do
so
eton
was
now
more
pleasant
to
him
than
desmond
court
which
indeed
had
but
little
of
pleasantness
to
offer
to
a
lad
such
as
he
was
now
he
was
sixteen
and
manly
for
his
age
but
the
question
in
dispute
at
desmond
court
offered
little
attraction
even
to
a
manly
boy
of
sixteen
in
that
former
question
as
to
owen
he
had
said
a
word
or
two
knowing
that
owen
could
not
be
looked
upon
as
a
fitting
husband
for
his
sister
but
now
he
knew
not
how
to
counsel
her
again
as
to
herbert
seeing
that
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
he
had
written
a
long
letter
congratulating
her
on
that
connection
towards
the
end
of
the
month
however
he
did
arrive
making
glad
his
mother
heart
as
she
looked
at
his
strong
limbs
and
his
handsome
open
face
and
clara
too
threw
herself
so
warmly
into
his
arms
that
he
did
feel
glad
that
he
had
come
to
her
oh
patrick
it
is
so
sweet
to
have
you
here
she
said
before
his
mother
had
had
time
to
speak
to
him
dearest
clara
but
patrick
you
must
not
be
cruel
to
me
look
here
patrick
you
are
my
only
brother
and
i
so
love
you
that
i
would
not
offend
you
or
turn
you
against
me
for
worlds
you
are
the
head
of
our
family
too
and
nothing
should
be
done
that
you
do
not
like
but
if
so
much
depends
on
you
you
must
think
well
before
you
decide
on
anything
he
opened
his
young
eyes
and
looked
intently
into
her
face
for
there
was
an
earnestness
in
her
words
that
almost
frightened
him
you
must
think
well
of
it
all
before
you
speak
patrick
and
remember
this
you
and
i
must
be
honest
and
honourable
whether
we
be
poor
or
no
you
remember
about
owen
fitzgerald
how
i
gave
way
then
because
i
could
do
so
without
dishonour
but
now
but
clara
i
do
not
understand
it
all
as
yet
no
you
can
not
not
as
yet
and
i
will
let
mamma
tell
you
the
story
all
i
ask
is
this
that
you
will
think
of
my
honour
before
you
say
a
word
that
can
favour
either
her
or
me
and
then
he
promised
her
that
he
would
do
so
and
his
mother
when
on
the
following
morning
she
told
him
all
the
history
found
him
reserved
and
silent
look
at
his
position
said
the
mother
pleading
her
cause
before
her
son
he
is
illegitimate
and
yes
but
mother
i
know
all
that
my
dear
i
know
what
you
would
say
and
no
one
can
pity
fitzgerald
position
more
than
i
do
but
you
would
not
on
that
account
have
your
sister
ruined
it
is
romance
on
her
part
but
what
does
he
say
he
is
quite
willing
to
give
up
the
match
he
has
told
me
so
and
said
as
much
to
his
aunt
whom
i
have
seen
three
times
on
the
subject
do
you
mean
that
he
wishes
to
give
it
up
no
at
least
i
do
know
if
he
does
he
can
not
express
such
a
wish
because
clara
is
so
headstrong
patrick
in
my
heart
i
do
not
believe
that
she
cares
for
him
i
have
doubted
it
for
some
time
but
you
wanted
her
to
marry
him
so
i
did
it
was
an
excellent
match
and
in
a
certain
way
she
did
like
him
and
then
you
know
there
was
that
great
danger
about
poor
owen
it
was
a
great
danger
then
but
now
she
is
so
determined
about
this
because
she
thinks
it
would
be
ungenerous
to
go
back
from
her
word
and
in
this
way
she
will
ruin
the
very
man
she
wishes
to
serve
of
course
he
can
not
break
off
the
match
if
she
persists
in
it
what
i
want
you
to
perceive
is
this
that
he
utterly
penniless
as
he
is
will
have
to
begin
the
world
with
a
clog
round
his
neck
because
she
is
so
obstinate
what
could
possibly
be
worse
for
him
than
a
titled
wife
without
a
penny
and
in
this
way
the
countess
pleaded
her
side
of
the
question
before
her
son
it
was
quite
true
that
she
had
been
three
times
to
castle
richmond
and
had
thrice
driven
aunt
letty
into
a
state
bordering
on
distraction
if
she
could
only
get
the
castle
richmond
people
to
take
it
up
as
they
ought
to
do
it
was
thus
she
argued
with
herself
and
with
aunt
letty
also
endeavouring
to
persuade
her
that
these
two
young
people
would
undoubtedly
ruin
each
other
unless
those
who
were
really
wise
and
prudent
and
who
understood
the
world
such
as
aunt
letty
for
instance
would
interfere
to
prevent
it
aunt
letty
on
the
whole
did
agree
with
her
though
she
greatly
disliked
her
miss
fitzgerald
had
strongly
planted
within
her
bosom
the
prudent
notion
that
young
gentlefolks
should
not
love
each
other
unless
they
have
plenty
of
money
and
that
if
unfortunately
such
did
love
each
other
it
was
better
that
they
should
suffer
all
the
pangs
of
hopeless
love
than
marry
and
trust
to
god
and
their
wits
for
bread
and
cheese
to
which
opinion
of
aunt
letty
as
well
as
to
some
others
entertained
by
that
lady
with
much
pertinacity
i
can
not
subscribe
myself
as
an
adherent
lady
desmond
had
wit
enough
to
discover
that
aunt
letty
did
agree
with
her
in
the
main
and
on
this
account
she
was
eager
in
seeking
her
assistance
lady
fitzgerald
of
course
could
not
be
seen
and
there
was
no
one
else
at
castle
richmond
who
could
be
supposed
to
have
any
weight
with
herbert
and
therefore
lady
desmond
was
very
eloquent
with
aunt
letty
talking
much
of
the
future
miseries
of
the
two
young
people
till
the
old
lady
had
promised
to
use
her
best
efforts
in
enlisting
lady
fitzgerald
on
the
same
side
you
can
not
wonder
miss
fitzgerald
that
i
should
wish
to
put
an
end
to
the
cruel
position
in
which
my
poor
girl
is
placed
you
know
how
much
a
girl
suffers
from
that
kind
of
thing
aunt
letty
did
dislike
lady
desmond
very
much
but
nevertheless
she
could
not
deny
the
truth
of
all
this
and
therefore
it
may
be
said
that
the
visits
of
the
countess
to
castle
richmond
were
on
the
whole
successful
and
the
month
wore
itself
away
also
in
that
sad
household
and
the
fitzgeralds
were
gradually
becoming
used
to
their
position
family
discussions
were
held
among
them
as
to
what
they
should
do
and
where
they
should
live
in
future
prendergast
had
written
seeing
that
owen
had
persisted
in
refusing
to
make
the
offer
personally
himself
saying
that
there
was
no
hurry
for
any
removal
sir
owen
he
said
having
considered
deeply
whether
or
no
he
would
call
him
by
the
title
or
no
and
having
resolved
that
it
would
be
best
to
do
so
at
once
sir
owen
was
inclined
to
behave
very
generously
lady
fitzgerald
could
have
the
house
and
demesne
at
any
rate
for
twelve
months
and
by
that
time
the
personal
property
left
by
sir
thomas
would
be
realized
and
there
would
be
enough
prendergast
said
for
the
three
ladies
to
live
decent
quiet
comfort
prendergast
had
taken
care
before
he
left
castle
richmond
that
a
will
should
be
made
and
duly
executed
by
sir
thomas
leaving
what
money
he
had
to
his
three
children
by
name
in
trust
for
their
use
till
the
girls
should
be
of
age
that
trust
would
be
vested
in
herbert
decent
quiet
comfort
said
mary
to
her
brother
and
sister
as
they
conned
the
letter
over
how
comfortless
it
sounds
and
so
the
first
month
after
the
death
of
sir
thomas
passed
by
and
the
misfortunes
of
the
fitzgerald
family
ceased
to
be
the
only
subject
spoken
of
by
the
inhabitants
of
county
cork
chapter
xxxii
preparations
for
going
at
the
end
of
the
month
herbert
began
to
prepare
himself
for
facing
the
world
the
first
question
to
be
answered
was
that
one
which
is
so
frequently
asked
in
most
families
but
which
had
never
yet
been
necessary
in
this
what
profession
would
he
follow
all
manners
of
ways
by
which
an
educated
man
can
earn
his
bread
had
been
turned
over
in
his
mind
and
in
the
minds
of
those
who
loved
him
beginning
with
the
revenues
of
the
archbishop
of
armagh
which
was
aunt
idea
and
ending
with
a
seat
at
a
government
desk
which
was
his
own
prendergast
had
counselled
the
law
not
his
own
lower
branch
of
the
profession
but
a
barrister
wig
adding
in
his
letter
to
lady
fitzgerald
that
if
herbert
would
come
to
london
and
settle
in
chambers
he
prendergast
would
see
that
his
life
was
made
agreeable
to
him
but
somers
gave
other
advice
in
those
days
assistant
commissioners
were
being
appointed
in
ireland
almost
by
the
score
and
somers
declared
that
herbert
had
only
to
signify
his
wish
for
such
a
position
and
he
would
get
it
the
interest
which
he
had
taken
in
the
welfare
of
the
poor
around
him
was
well
known
and
as
his
own
story
was
well
known
also
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
government
would
be
willing
to
assist
one
so
circumstanced
and
who
when
assisted
would
make
himself
so
useful
such
was
the
advice
of
somers
and
he
might
have
been
right
but
for
this
that
both
herbert
and
lady
fitzgerald
felt
that
it
would
be
well
for
them
to
move
out
of
that
neighbourhood
out
of
ireland
altogether
if
such
could
be
possible
aunt
letty
was
strong
for
the
church
a
young
man
who
had
distinguished
himself
at
the
university
so
signally
as
her
nephew
had
done
taking
his
degree
at
the
very
first
attempt
and
that
in
so
high
a
class
of
honour
as
the
fourth
would
not
fail
to
succeed
in
the
church
he
might
not
perhaps
succeed
as
to
armagh
that
she
admitted
but
there
were
some
thirty
other
bishoprics
to
be
had
and
it
would
be
odd
if
with
his
talents
he
did
not
get
one
of
them
think
what
it
would
be
if
he
were
to
return
to
his
own
country
as
bishop
of
cork
cloyne
and
ross
as
to
which
amalgamation
of
sees
however
aunt
letty
had
her
own
ideas
he
was
slightly
tainted
with
the
venom
of
puseyism
aunt
letty
said
to
herself
but
nothing
would
dispel
this
with
so
much
certainty
as
the
theological
studies
necessary
for
ordination
and
then
aunt
letty
talked
it
over
by
the
hour
together
with
townsend
and
both
those
ladies
were
agreed
that
herbert
should
get
himself
ordained
as
quickly
as
possible
not
in
england
where
there
might
be
danger
even
in
ordination
but
in
good
wholesome
protestant
ireland
where
a
church
of
england
clergyman
was
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
and
not
a
priest
slipping
about
in
the
mud
half
way
between
england
and
rome
herbert
himself
was
anxious
to
get
some
employment
by
which
he
might
immediately
earn
his
bread
but
not
unnaturally
wished
that
london
should
be
the
scene
of
his
work
anywhere
in
ireland
he
would
be
known
as
the
fitzgerald
who
ought
to
have
been
fitzgerald
of
castle
richmond
and
then
too
he
as
other
young
men
had
an
undefined
idea
that
as
he
must
earn
his
bread
london
should
be
his
ground
he
had
at
first
been
not
ill
inclined
to
that
church
project
and
had
thus
given
a
sort
of
ground
on
which
aunt
letty
was
able
to
stand
had
as
it
were
given
her
some
authority
for
carrying
on
an
agitation
in
furtherance
of
her
own
views
but
herbert
himself
soon
gave
up
this
idea
a
man
he
thought
to
be
a
clergyman
should
have
a
very
strong
predilection
in
favour
of
that
profession
and
so
he
gradually
abandoned
that
idea
actuated
as
poor
aunt
letty
feared
by
the
agency
of
the
evil
one
working
through
the
means
of
puseyism
his
mother
and
sisters
were
in
favour
of
prendergast
views
and
as
it
was
gradually
found
by
them
all
that
there
would
not
be
any
immediate
pressure
as
regarded
pecuniary
means
that
seemed
at
last
to
be
their
decision
herbert
would
remain
yet
for
three
or
four
weeks
at
castle
richmond
till
matters
there
were
somewhat
more
thoroughly
settled
and
would
then
put
himself
into
the
hands
of
prendergast
in
london
prendergast
would
select
a
legal
tutor
for
him
and
proper
legal
chambers
and
then
not
long
afterwards
his
mother
and
sisters
should
follow
and
they
would
live
together
at
some
small
villa
residence
near
john
wood
road
or
perhaps
out
at
brompton
it
is
astonishing
how
quickly
in
this
world
of
ours
chaos
will
settle
itself
into
decent
and
graceful
order
when
it
is
properly
looked
in
the
face
and
handled
with
a
steady
hand
which
is
not
sparing
of
the
broom
some
three
months
since
everything
at
castle
richmond
was
ruin
such
ruin
indeed
that
the
very
power
of
living
under
it
seemed
to
be
doubtful
when
first
prendergast
arrived
there
a
feeling
came
upon
them
all
as
though
they
might
hardly
dare
to
live
in
a
world
which
would
look
at
them
as
so
thoroughly
degraded
as
regards
means
they
would
be
beggars
and
as
regards
position
so
much
worse
than
beggars
a
broken
world
was
in
truth
falling
about
their
ears
and
it
was
felt
to
be
impossible
that
they
should
endure
its
convulsions
and
yet
live
but
now
the
world
had
fallen
the
ruin
had
come
and
they
were
already
strong
in
future
hopes
they
had
dared
to
look
at
their
chaos
and
found
that
it
still
contained
the
elements
of
order
there
was
much
still
that
marred
their
happiness
and
forbade
the
joyousness
of
other
days
their
poor
father
had
gone
from
them
in
their
misery
and
the
house
was
still
a
house
of
mourning
and
their
mother
too
though
she
bore
up
so
wonderfully
against
her
fate
and
for
their
sakes
hoped
and
planned
and
listened
to
their
wishes
was
a
stricken
woman
that
she
would
never
smile
again
with
any
heartfelt
joy
they
were
all
sure
but
nevertheless
their
chaos
was
conquered
and
there
was
hope
that
the
fields
of
life
would
again
show
themselves
green
and
fruitful
on
one
subject
their
mother
never
spoke
to
them
nor
had
even
herbert
dared
to
speak
to
her
not
a
word
had
been
said
in
that
house
since
prendergast
left
it
as
to
the
future
whereabouts
or
future
doings
of
that
man
to
whom
she
had
once
given
her
hand
at
the
altar
but
she
had
ventured
to
ask
by
letter
a
question
of
prendergast
her
question
had
been
this
what
must
i
do
that
he
may
not
come
to
me
or
to
my
children
in
answer
to
this
prendergast
had
told
her
after
some
delay
that
he
believed
she
need
fear
nothing
he
had
seen
the
man
and
he
thought
that
he
might
assure
her
that
she
would
not
be
troubled
in
that
respect
it
is
possible
said
prendergast
that
he
may
apply
to
you
by
letter
for
money
if
so
give
him
no
answer
whatever
but
send
his
letters
to
me
and
are
you
all
going
asked
townsend
of
aunt
letty
with
a
lachrymose
voice
soon
after
the
fate
of
the
family
was
decided
they
were
sitting
together
with
their
knees
over
the
fire
in
townsend
in
which
the
perilous
state
of
the
country
had
been
discussed
by
them
for
many
a
pleasant
hour
together
well
i
think
we
shall
you
see
my
sister
would
never
be
happy
here
no
no
the
shock
and
the
change
would
be
too
great
for
her
poor
lady
fitzgerald
and
when
is
that
man
coming
into
the
house
what
owen
yes
sir
owen
i
suppose
he
is
now
well
i
do
know
he
does
not
seem
to
be
in
any
hurry
i
believe
that
he
has
said
that
my
sister
may
continue
to
live
there
if
she
pleases
but
of
course
she
can
not
do
that
they
do
say
about
the
country
whispered
townsend
that
he
refuses
to
be
the
heir
at
all
he
certainly
has
not
had
any
cards
printed
with
the
title
on
them
i
know
that
as
a
fact
he
is
a
very
singular
man
very
you
know
i
never
could
bear
him
said
aunt
letty
no
nor
i
either
he
has
not
been
to
our
church
once
these
six
months
but
it
very
odd
is
it
of
course
you
know
the
story
what
story
asked
aunt
letty
about
lady
clara
owen
fitzgerald
was
dreadfully
in
love
with
her
before
your
herbert
had
ever
seen
her
and
they
do
say
that
he
has
sworn
his
cousin
shall
never
live
if
he
marries
her
they
can
never
marry
now
you
know
only
think
of
it
there
would
be
three
hundred
a
year
between
not
at
present
that
is
added
aunt
letty
looking
forward
to
a
future
period
after
her
own
death
that
is
very
little
very
little
indeed
said
townsend
remembering
however
that
she
herself
had
married
on
less
but
miss
fitzgerald
if
herbert
does
not
marry
her
do
you
think
this
owen
will
i
do
think
she
have
him
i
am
quite
sure
she
would
not
not
when
he
has
all
the
property
and
the
title
too
no
nor
double
as
much
what
would
people
say
of
her
if
she
did
but
however
there
is
no
fear
for
she
declares
that
nothing
shall
induce
her
to
give
up
her
engagement
with
our
herbert
and
so
they
discussed
it
backward
and
forward
in
every
way
each
having
her
own
theory
as
to
that
singular
rumour
which
was
going
about
the
country
signifying
that
owen
had
declined
to
accept
the
title
aunt
letty
however
would
not
believe
that
any
good
could
come
from
so
polluted
a
source
and
declared
that
he
had
his
own
reasons
for
the
delay
it
not
for
any
love
of
us
she
said
if
he
refuses
to
take
either
that
or
the
estate
and
in
this
she
was
right
but
she
would
have
been
more
surprised
still
had
she
learned
that
owen
forbearance
arose
from
a
strong
anxiety
to
do
what
was
just
in
the
matter
and
so
herbert
wo
go
into
the
church
and
letty
shook
her
head
sorrowing
√¶neas
would
have
been
so
glad
to
have
taken
him
for
a
reading
said
townsend
he
could
have
come
here
you
know
when
you
went
away
and
been
ordained
at
cork
and
got
a
curacy
close
in
the
neighbourhood
where
he
was
known
it
would
have
been
so
nice
would
it
aunt
letty
would
not
exactly
have
advised
the
scheme
as
suggested
by
townsend
her
ideas
as
to
herbert
clerical
studies
would
have
been
higher
than
this
trinity
college
dublin
was
in
her
estimation
the
only
place
left
for
good
church
of
england
ecclesiastical
teaching
but
as
herbert
was
obstinately
bent
on
declining
sacerdotal
life
there
was
no
use
in
dispelling
townsend
bright
vision
it
all
of
no
use
she
said
he
is
determined
to
go
to
the
bar
the
bar
is
very
respectable
said
townsend
kindly
and
you
mean
to
go
with
them
too
said
townsend
after
another
pause
you
hardly
be
happy
i
thinking
so
far
away
from
your
old
home
it
is
sad
to
change
at
my
time
of
life
said
aunt
letty
plaintively
i
now
nonsense
said
townsend
who
however
knew
her
age
to
a
day
if
i
live
another
week
and
i
have
never
yet
had
any
home
but
castle
richmond
there
i
was
born
and
till
the
other
day
i
had
every
reason
to
trust
that
there
i
might
die
but
what
does
it
matter
no
that
true
of
course
what
does
it
matter
where
we
are
while
we
linger
in
this
vale
of
tears
but
could
you
get
a
little
place
for
yourself
somewhere
near
here
there
callaghan
cottage
with
the
piece
for
a
cow
and
as
nice
a
spot
of
a
garden
as
there
is
in
the
county
cork
i
would
separate
myself
from
her
now
said
aunt
letty
for
all
the
cottages
and
all
the
gardens
in
ireland
the
lord
has
been
pleased
to
throw
us
together
and
together
we
will
finish
our
pilgrimage
whither
she
goes
i
will
go
and
where
she
lodges
i
will
lodge
her
people
shall
be
my
people
and
her
god
my
god
and
then
townsend
said
nothing
further
of
callaghan
pretty
cottage
or
of
the
piece
but
one
reason
for
her
going
aunt
letty
did
not
give
even
to
her
friend
townsend
her
income
that
which
belonged
exclusively
to
herself
was
in
no
way
affected
by
these
sad
castle
richmond
revolutions
this
was
a
comfortable
we
may
say
a
generous
provision
for
an
old
maiden
lady
amounting
to
some
six
hundred
a
year
settled
upon
her
for
life
and
this
if
added
to
what
could
be
saved
and
scraped
together
would
enable
them
to
live
comfortably
as
far
as
means
were
concerned
in
that
suburban
villa
to
which
they
were
looking
forward
but
without
aunt
letty
income
that
suburban
villa
must
be
but
a
poor
home
prendergast
had
calculated
that
some
fourteen
thousand
pounds
would
represent
the
remaining
property
of
the
family
with
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
purchase
government
stock
such
being
the
case
aunt
letty
income
was
very
material
to
them
i
trust
you
will
be
able
to
find
some
one
there
who
will
preach
the
gospel
to
you
said
townsend
in
a
tone
that
showed
how
serious
were
her
misgivings
on
the
subject
i
will
search
for
such
a
one
at
any
rate
said
aunt
letty
you
need
not
be
afraid
that
i
shall
be
a
backslider
but
they
have
crosses
now
over
the
communion
tables
in
the
churches
in
england
said
townsend
i
know
it
is
very
bad
said
aunt
letty
but
there
will
always
be
a
remnant
left
the
lord
will
not
utterly
desert
us
and
then
she
took
her
departure
leaving
townsend
with
the
conviction
that
the
land
to
which
her
friend
was
going
was
one
in
which
the
light
of
the
gospel
no
longer
shone
in
its
purity
it
was
not
wonderful
that
they
should
all
be
anxious
to
get
away
from
castle
richmond
for
the
house
there
was
now
not
a
pleasant
one
in
which
to
live
let
all
those
who
have
houses
and
the
adjuncts
of
houses
think
how
considerable
a
part
of
their
life
pleasures
consists
in
their
interest
in
the
things
around
them
when
will
the
be
fit
to
cut
and
when
will
the
crocuses
come
up
will
the
violets
be
sweeter
than
ever
and
the
geranium
cuttings
are
they
thriving
we
have
dug
and
manured
and
sown
and
we
look
forward
to
the
reaping
and
to
see
our
garners
full
the
very
furniture
which
ministers
to
our
daily
uses
is
loved
and
petted
and
in
decorating
our
rooms
we
educate
ourselves
in
design
the
place
in
church
which
has
been
our
own
for
years
is
not
that
dear
to
us
and
the
voice
that
has
told
us
of
god
tidings
even
though
the
drone
become
more
evident
as
it
waxes
in
years
and
though
it
grows
feeble
and
indolent
and
the
faces
of
those
who
have
lived
around
us
do
we
not
love
them
too
the
servants
who
have
worked
for
us
and
the
children
who
have
first
toddled
beneath
our
eyes
and
prattled
in
our
ears
and
now
run
their
strong
races
screaming
loudly
splashing
us
as
they
pass
very
unpleasantly
do
we
not
love
them
all
do
they
not
all
contribute
to
the
great
sum
of
our
enjoyment
all
men
love
such
things
more
or
less
even
though
they
know
it
not
and
women
love
them
even
more
than
men
and
the
fitzgeralds
were
about
to
leave
them
all
the
early
buds
of
spring
were
now
showing
themselves
but
how
was
it
possible
that
they
should
look
to
them
one
loves
the
bud
because
one
expects
the
flower
the
now
was
beyond
their
notice
and
though
they
plucked
the
crocuses
they
did
so
with
tears
upon
their
cheeks
after
much
consideration
the
church
had
been
abandoned
by
all
except
aunt
letty
and
herbert
that
lady
fitzgerald
should
go
there
was
impossible
and
the
girls
were
only
too
glad
to
be
allowed
to
stay
with
their
mother
and
the
schools
in
which
they
had
taught
since
the
first
day
in
which
teaching
had
been
possible
for
them
had
to
be
abandoned
with
such
true
pangs
of
heartfelt
sorrow
from
the
time
when
their
misery
first
came
upon
them
from
the
days
when
it
first
began
to
be
understood
that
the
world
had
gone
wrong
at
castle
richmond
this
separation
from
the
schools
had
commenced
the
work
had
been
dropped
for
a
while
but
the
dropping
had
in
fact
been
final
and
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
done
than
the
saddest
of
all
leavetaking
the
girls
had
sent
word
to
the
children
perhaps
imprudently
that
they
would
go
down
and
say
a
word
of
adieu
to
their
pupils
the
children
had
of
course
told
their
mothers
and
when
the
girls
reached
the
two
neat
buildings
which
stood
at
the
corner
of
the
park
there
were
there
to
meet
them
not
unnaturally
a
concourse
of
women
and
children
in
former
prosperous
days
the
people
about
castle
richmond
had
as
a
rule
been
better
to
do
than
their
neighbours
money
wages
had
been
more
plentiful
and
there
had
been
little
or
no
subletting
of
land
the
children
had
been
somewhat
more
neatly
clothed
and
the
women
less
haggard
in
their
faces
but
this
difference
was
hardly
perceptible
any
longer
to
them
the
miss
fitzgeralds
looking
at
the
assemblage
it
almost
seemed
as
though
the
misfortune
of
their
house
had
brought
down
its
immediate
consequences
on
all
who
had
lived
within
their
circle
but
this
was
the
work
of
the
famine
in
those
days
one
could
rarely
see
any
member
of
a
peasant
family
bearing
in
his
face
a
look
of
health
the
yellow
meal
was
a
useful
food
the
most
useful
doubtless
which
could
at
that
time
be
found
but
it
was
not
one
that
was
gratifying
either
to
the
eye
or
palate
the
girls
had
almost
regretted
their
offer
before
they
had
left
the
house
it
would
have
been
better
they
said
to
themselves
to
have
had
the
children
up
in
the
hall
and
there
to
have
spoken
their
farewells
and
made
their
little
presents
the
very
entering
those
schoolrooms
again
would
almost
be
too
much
for
them
but
this
consideration
was
now
too
late
and
when
they
got
to
the
corner
of
the
gate
they
found
that
there
was
a
crowd
to
receive
them
mary
i
must
go
back
said
emmeline
when
she
first
saw
them
but
aunt
letty
who
was
with
them
stepped
forward
and
they
soon
found
themselves
in
the
schoolroom
we
have
come
to
say
to
you
all
said
aunt
letty
trying
to
begin
a
speech
may
the
heavens
be
yer
bed
then
the
lot
of
yez
for
ye
war
always
good
to
the
poor
may
the
blessed
virgin
guide
and
protect
ye
wherever
ye
be
a
blessing
against
which
aunt
letty
at
once
entered
a
little
inward
protest
perturbed
though
she
was
in
spirit
may
the
heavens
rain
glory
on
yer
heads
for
ye
war
always
the
finest
family
that
war
ever
in
the
county
cork
you
know
i
dare
say
that
we
are
going
to
leave
you
continued
aunt
letty
we
knows
it
we
knows
it
sorrow
come
to
them
as
did
it
all
faix
an
there
niver
be
any
good
in
the
counthry
at
all
at
all
when
you
gone
miss
emmeline
an
what
we
do
at
all
for
the
want
of
yez
and
when
shall
we
see
the
likes
of
yez
eh
miss
letty
but
there
be
sore
eyes
weeping
for
ye
and
for
her
leddyship
too
may
the
lord
almighty
bless
her
and
presarve
her
and
carry
her
sowl
to
glory
when
she
dies
for
av
there
war
iver
a
good
woman
on
that
woman
is
leddy
fitzgerald
and
then
aunt
letty
found
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
her
to
continue
her
speech
and
indeed
no
possibility
of
her
doing
so
even
if
she
were
so
minded
the
children
began
to
wail
and
cry
and
the
mothers
also
mixed
loud
sobbings
with
their
loud
prayers
and
emmeline
and
mary
dissolved
in
tears
sat
themselves
down
drawing
to
them
the
youngest
bairns
and
those
whom
they
had
loved
the
best
kissing
their
sallow
unwholesome
faces
and
weeping
over
them
with
a
love
of
which
hitherto
they
had
been
hardly
conscious
there
was
not
much
more
in
the
way
of
speech
possible
to
any
of
them
for
even
aunt
letty
was
far
gone
in
tender
wailing
and
it
was
wonderful
to
see
the
liberties
that
were
taken
even
with
that
venerable
bonnet
the
women
had
first
of
all
taken
hold
of
her
hands
to
kiss
them
and
had
kissed
her
feet
and
her
garments
and
her
shoulders
and
then
behind
her
back
they
had
made
crosses
on
her
although
they
knew
how
dreadfully
she
would
have
raged
had
she
caught
them
polluting
her
by
such
doings
and
they
grasped
her
arms
and
embraced
them
till
at
last
those
who
were
more
daring
reached
her
forehead
and
her
face
and
poor
old
aunt
letty
who
in
her
emotion
could
not
now
utter
a
syllable
was
almost
pulled
to
pieces
among
them
mary
and
emmeline
had
altogether
surrendered
themselves
and
were
the
centres
of
clusters
of
children
who
hung
upon
them
and
the
sobs
now
were
no
longer
low
and
tearful
but
they
had
grown
into
long
protracted
groanings
and
loud
wailings
and
clapping
of
hands
and
tearings
of
the
hair
o
my
reader
have
you
ever
seen
a
railway
train
taking
its
departure
from
an
irish
station
with
a
freight
of
irish
emigrants
if
so
you
know
how
the
hair
is
torn
and
how
the
hands
are
clapped
and
how
the
low
moanings
gradually
swell
into
notes
of
loud
lamentation
it
means
nothing
i
have
heard
men
say
men
and
women
too
but
such
men
and
women
are
wrong
it
means
much
it
means
this
that
those
who
are
separated
not
only
love
each
other
but
are
anxious
to
tell
each
other
that
they
so
love
we
have
all
heard
of
demonstrative
people
a
demonstrative
person
i
take
it
is
he
who
is
desirous
of
speaking
out
what
is
in
his
heart
for
myself
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
such
speaking
out
has
its
good
ends
the
faculty
of
silence
is
it
not
of
all
things
the
most
beautiful
that
is
the
doctrine
preached
by
a
great
philosopher
for
myself
i
think
that
the
faculty
of
speech
is
much
more
beautiful
of
speech
if
it
be
made
but
by
howlings
and
wailings
and
loud
clappings
of
the
hand
what
is
in
a
man
let
it
come
out
and
be
known
to
those
around
him
if
it
be
bad
it
will
find
correction
if
it
be
good
it
will
spread
and
be
beneficent
and
then
one
woman
made
herself
audible
over
the
sobs
of
the
crowding
children
she
was
a
gaunt
woman
but
she
would
have
been
comely
if
not
handsome
had
not
the
famine
come
upon
her
she
held
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
another
little
toddling
thing
had
been
hanging
on
her
dress
till
emmeline
had
seen
it
and
plucked
it
away
and
it
was
now
sitting
in
her
lap
quite
composed
and
sucking
a
piece
of
cake
that
had
been
given
to
it
an
it
a
bad
day
for
us
all
said
the
woman
beginning
in
a
low
voice
which
became
louder
and
louder
as
she
went
on
it
a
bad
day
for
us
all
that
takes
away
from
us
the
only
rale
friends
that
we
iver
had
and
the
back
of
my
hand
to
them
that
have
come
in
the
way
bringin
sorrow
an
desolation
misery
on
gentlefolks
that
have
been
good
to
the
poor
since
iver
the
poor
have
been
in
the
land
rale
gentlefolks
sich
as
there
ai
no
others
to
be
found
nowadays
in
any
of
these
parts
but
it
a
bad
day
for
us
and
for
the
childer
for
where
shall
we
find
the
dhrop
to
comfort
us
or
the
bit
to
ate
when
the
sickness
comes
on
us
as
it
likely
to
come
now
when
the
fitzgeralds
is
out
of
the
counthry
may
the
lord
bless
them
and
keep
them
and
presarve
them
and
the
holy
virgin
have
them
in
her
keepin
wh
i
s
h
h
said
aunt
letty
who
could
not
allow
such
idolatry
to
pass
by
unobserved
or
unrebuked
an
shure
the
blessin
of
a
poor
woman
can
not
haram
you
continued
the
mother
an
i
tell
you
what
neighbours
it
be
a
bad
day
for
him
that
folk
call
the
heir
when
he
puts
his
foot
in
that
house
an
that
thrue
for
you
bridget
magrath
said
another
voice
from
among
the
crowd
of
women
a
bad
day
intirely
continued
the
woman
with
the
baby
av
the
house
stans
over
his
head
when
he
does
the
like
o
that
there
be
no
justice
in
the
heavens
but
magrath
said
aunt
letty
trying
to
interrupt
her
you
must
not
speak
in
that
way
you
are
mistaken
in
supposing
that
owen
we
all
live
to
see
said
the
woman
for
the
time
comin
quick
upon
us
now
but
it
a
bad
law
that
kills
our
ould
masther
over
our
heads
an
takes
away
from
us
our
ould
misthress
an
as
for
him
they
calls
owen
but
the
ladies
found
it
impossible
to
listen
to
her
any
longer
so
with
some
difficulty
they
extricated
themselves
from
the
crowd
by
which
they
were
surrounded
and
once
more
shaking
hands
with
those
who
were
nearest
to
them
escaped
into
the
park
and
made
their
way
back
towards
the
house
they
had
not
expected
so
much
demonstration
and
were
not
a
little
disconcerted
at
the
scene
which
had
taken
place
aunt
letty
had
never
been
so
handled
in
her
life
and
hardly
knew
how
to
make
her
bonnet
sit
comfortably
on
her
head
and
the
two
girls
were
speechless
till
they
were
half
across
the
park
i
am
glad
we
have
been
said
emmeline
at
last
as
soon
as
the
remains
of
her
emotion
would
allow
her
to
articulate
her
words
it
would
have
been
dreadful
to
have
gone
away
without
seeing
them
said
mary
poor
creatures
poor
dear
creatures
we
shall
never
again
have
any
more
people
to
be
fond
of
us
like
that
there
is
no
knowing
said
aunt
letty
the
lord
giveth
and
the
lord
taketh
away
and
blessed
is
the
name
of
the
lord
you
are
both
young
and
may
come
back
again
but
for
me
dear
aunt
letty
if
we
come
back
you
shall
come
too
if
i
only
thought
that
my
bones
could
lie
here
near
my
brother
but
never
mind
what
signifies
it
where
our
bones
lie
and
then
they
were
silent
for
a
while
till
aunt
letty
spoke
again
i
mean
to
be
quite
happy
over
in
england
i
believe
i
shall
be
happiest
of
you
all
if
i
can
find
any
clergyman
who
is
not
half
perverted
to
idolatry
this
took
place
some
time
before
the
ladies
left
castle
richmond
perhaps
as
much
as
three
weeks
it
was
even
before
herbert
departure
who
started
for
london
the
day
but
one
after
the
scene
here
recorded
he
had
gone
to
various
places
to
take
his
last
farewell
to
see
the
townsends
at
the
parsonage
to
call
on
father
barney
at
kanturk
and
had
even
shaken
hands
with
the
rev
creagh
at
gortnaclough
but
one
farewell
visit
had
been
put
off
for
the
last
it
was
now
arranged
that
he
was
to
go
over
to
desmond
court
and
see
clara
before
he
went
there
had
been
some
difficulty
in
this
for
lady
desmond
had
at
first
declared
that
she
could
not
feel
justified
in
asking
him
into
her
house
but
the
earl
was
now
at
home
and
her
ladyship
had
at
last
given
her
consent
he
was
to
see
the
countess
first
and
was
afterwards
to
see
clara
alone
he
had
declared
that
he
would
not
go
there
unless
he
were
to
be
allowed
an
interview
with
her
in
private
the
countess
as
i
have
said
at
last
consented
trusting
that
her
previous
eloquence
might
be
efficacious
in
counteracting
the
ill
effects
of
her
daughter
imprudence
on
the
day
after
that
interview
he
was
to
start
for
london
never
to
return
as
he
said
to
emmeline
unless
he
came
to
seek
his
wife
but
you
will
come
to
seek
your
wife
said
emmeline
stoutly
i
shall
think
you
if
you
doubt
it
chapter
xxxiii
the
last
stage
on
the
day
before
his
departure
for
london
herbert
fitzgerald
once
more
got
on
his
horse
the
horse
that
was
to
be
no
longer
his
after
that
day
and
rode
off
towards
desmond
court
he
had
already
perceived
how
foolish
he
had
been
in
walking
thither
through
the
mud
and
rain
when
last
he
went
there
and
how
much
he
had
lost
by
his
sad
appearance
that
day
and
by
his
want
of
personal
comfort
so
he
dressed
himself
with
some
care
dressing
not
for
his
love
but
for
the
countess
and
taking
his
whip
in
his
gloved
hand
he
got
up
on
his
nag
with
more
spirit
than
he
had
hitherto
felt
nothing
could
be
better
than
the
manner
in
which
at
this
time
the
servants
about
castle
richmond
conducted
themselves
most
of
them
indeed
all
but
three
had
been
told
that
they
must
go
and
in
so
telling
them
the
truth
had
been
explained
it
had
been
found
aunt
letty
said
to
one
of
the
elder
among
them
that
herbert
was
not
the
heir
to
the
property
and
therefore
the
family
was
obliged
to
go
away
jones
of
course
accompanied
her
mistress
richard
had
been
told
both
by
herbert
and
by
aunt
letty
that
he
had
better
remain
and
live
on
a
small
patch
of
land
that
should
be
provided
for
him
but
in
answer
to
this
he
stated
his
intention
of
removing
himself
to
london
if
the
london
air
was
fit
for
my
leddy
and
miss
letty
it
would
be
fit
for
him
it
no
good
any
more
talking
herbert
said
richard
i
main
to
go
so
there
was
no
more
talking
and
he
did
go
but
all
the
other
servants
took
their
month
warning
with
tears
and
blessings
and
strove
one
beyond
another
how
they
might
best
serve
the
ladies
of
the
family
to
the
end
i
lose
the
little
fingers
off
me
to
go
with
you
miss
emmeline
so
i
would
said
one
poor
girl
all
in
vain
if
they
could
not
keep
a
retinue
of
servants
in
ireland
it
was
clear
enough
that
they
could
not
keep
them
in
london
the
groom
who
held
the
horse
for
herbert
to
mount
touched
his
hat
respectfully
as
his
young
master
rode
off
slowly
down
the
avenue
and
then
went
back
to
the
stables
to
meditate
with
awe
on
the
changes
which
had
happened
in
his
time
and
to
bethink
himself
whether
or
no
he
could
bring
himself
to
serve
in
the
stables
of
owen
the
usurper
herbert
did
not
take
the
direct
road
to
desmond
court
but
went
round
as
though
he
were
going
to
gortnaclough
and
then
turning
away
from
the
gortnaclough
road
made
his
way
by
a
cross
lane
towards
clady
and
the
mountains
he
hardly
knew
himself
whether
he
had
any
object
in
this
beyond
one
which
he
did
not
express
even
to
himself
that
namely
of
not
being
seen
on
the
way
leading
to
desmond
court
but
this
he
did
do
thereby
riding
out
of
the
district
with
which
he
was
most
thoroughly
acquainted
and
passing
by
cabins
and
patches
of
now
deserted
land
which
were
strange
to
him
it
was
a
poor
bleak
damp
undrained
country
lying
beyond
the
confines
of
his
property
which
in
good
days
had
never
been
pleasant
to
the
eye
but
which
now
in
these
days
days
that
were
so
decidedly
bad
was
anything
but
pleasant
it
was
one
of
those
tracts
of
land
which
had
been
divided
and
subdivided
among
the
cottiers
till
the
fields
had
dwindled
down
to
parts
of
acres
each
surrounded
by
rude
low
banks
which
of
themselves
seemed
to
occupy
a
quarter
of
the
surface
of
the
land
the
original
landmarks
the
big
earthen
banks
banks
so
large
that
a
horse
might
walk
on
the
top
of
them
were
still
visible
enough
showing
to
the
practised
eye
what
had
once
been
the
fields
into
which
the
land
had
been
divided
but
these
had
since
been
bisected
and
crossected
and
intersected
by
family
arrangements
in
which
brothers
had
been
jealous
of
brothers
and
fathers
of
their
children
till
each
little
lot
contained
but
a
rood
or
two
of
available
surface
this
had
been
miserable
enough
to
look
at
even
when
those
roods
had
been
cropped
with
potatoes
or
oats
but
now
they
were
not
cropped
at
all
nor
was
there
preparation
being
made
for
cropping
them
they
had
been
let
out
under
the
system
at
so
much
a
rood
for
the
potato
season
at
rents
amounting
sometimes
to
ten
or
twelve
pounds
the
acre
but
nobody
would
take
them
now
there
in
that
electoral
division
the
whole
proceeds
of
such
land
would
hardly
have
paid
the
poor
rates
and
therefore
the
land
was
left
uncultivated
the
winter
was
over
for
it
was
now
april
and
had
any
tillage
been
intended
it
would
have
been
commenced
even
in
ireland
it
was
the
beginning
of
april
but
the
weather
was
still
stormy
and
cold
and
the
east
wind
which
as
a
rule
strikes
ireland
with
but
a
light
hand
was
blowing
sharply
on
a
sudden
a
squall
of
rain
came
on
one
of
those
spring
squalls
which
are
so
piercingly
cold
but
which
are
sure
to
pass
by
rapidly
if
the
wayfarer
will
have
patience
to
wait
for
them
herbert
remembering
his
former
discomfiture
resolved
that
he
would
have
such
patience
and
dismounting
from
his
horse
at
a
cabin
on
the
entered
it
himself
and
led
his
horse
in
after
him
in
england
no
one
would
think
of
taking
his
steed
into
a
poor
man
cottage
and
would
hardly
put
his
beast
into
a
shed
without
leave
asked
and
granted
but
people
are
more
intimate
with
each
other
and
take
greater
liberties
in
ireland
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
on
a
wet
to
see
a
cabin
packed
with
horses
and
the
children
moving
about
among
them
almost
as
unconcernedly
as
though
the
animals
were
pigs
but
then
the
irish
horses
are
so
well
mannered
and
the
cabin
was
one
abutting
as
it
were
on
the
road
not
standing
back
upon
the
land
as
is
most
customary
and
it
was
built
in
an
angle
at
a
spot
where
the
road
made
a
turn
so
that
two
sides
of
it
stood
close
out
in
the
wayside
it
was
small
and
wretched
to
look
at
without
any
sort
of
outside
shed
or
even
a
scrap
of
attached
to
it
a
miserable
damp
ragged
tenement
as
wretched
as
any
that
might
be
seen
even
in
the
county
cork
but
the
nakedness
of
the
exterior
was
as
nothing
to
the
nakedness
of
the
interior
when
herbert
entered
followed
by
his
horse
his
eye
glanced
round
the
dark
place
and
it
seemed
to
be
empty
of
everything
there
was
no
fire
on
the
hearth
though
a
fire
on
the
hearth
is
the
easiest
of
all
luxuries
for
an
irishman
to
acquire
and
the
last
which
he
is
willing
to
lose
there
was
not
an
article
of
furniture
in
the
whole
place
neither
chairs
nor
table
nor
bed
nor
dresser
there
was
there
neither
dish
nor
cup
nor
plate
nor
even
the
iron
pot
in
which
all
the
cookery
of
the
irish
cottiers
menage
is
usually
carried
on
beneath
his
feet
was
the
damp
earthen
floor
and
around
him
were
damp
cracked
walls
and
over
his
head
was
the
old
lumpy
thatch
through
which
the
water
was
already
dropping
but
inside
was
to
be
seen
none
of
those
articles
of
daily
use
which
are
usually
to
be
found
in
the
houses
even
of
the
poorest
but
nevertheless
the
place
was
inhabited
squatting
in
the
middle
of
the
cabin
seated
on
her
legs
crossed
under
her
with
nothing
between
her
and
the
wet
earth
there
crouched
a
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
at
first
so
dark
was
the
place
herbert
hardly
thought
that
the
object
before
him
was
a
human
being
she
did
not
move
when
he
entered
or
speak
to
him
or
in
any
way
show
sign
of
surprise
that
he
should
have
come
there
there
was
room
for
him
and
his
horse
without
pushing
her
from
her
place
and
as
it
seemed
he
might
have
stayed
there
and
taken
his
departure
without
any
sign
having
been
made
by
her
but
as
his
eyes
became
used
to
the
light
he
saw
her
eyes
gleaming
brightly
through
the
gloom
they
were
very
large
and
bright
as
they
turned
round
upon
him
while
he
moved
large
and
bright
but
with
a
dull
unwholesome
brightness
a
brightness
that
had
in
it
none
of
the
light
of
life
and
then
he
looked
at
her
more
closely
she
had
on
her
some
rag
of
clothing
which
barely
sufficed
to
cover
her
nakedness
and
the
baby
which
she
held
in
her
arms
was
covered
in
some
sort
but
he
could
see
as
he
came
to
stand
close
over
her
that
these
garments
were
but
loose
rags
which
were
hardly
fastened
round
her
body
her
rough
short
hair
hung
down
upon
her
back
clotted
with
dirt
and
the
head
and
face
of
the
child
which
she
held
was
covered
with
dirt
and
sores
on
no
more
wretched
object
in
its
desolate
solitude
did
the
eye
of
man
ever
fall
in
those
days
there
was
a
form
of
face
which
came
upon
the
sufferers
when
their
state
of
misery
was
far
advanced
and
which
was
a
sure
sign
that
their
last
stage
of
misery
was
nearly
run
the
mouth
would
fall
and
seem
to
hang
the
lips
at
the
two
ends
of
the
mouth
would
be
dragged
down
and
the
lower
parts
of
the
cheeks
would
fall
as
though
they
had
been
dragged
and
pulled
there
were
no
signs
of
acute
agony
when
this
phasis
of
countenance
was
to
be
seen
none
of
the
horrid
symptoms
of
gnawing
hunger
by
which
one
generally
supposes
that
famine
is
accompanied
the
look
is
one
of
apathy
desolation
and
death
when
custom
had
made
these
signs
easily
legible
the
poor
doomed
wretch
was
known
with
certainty
it
no
use
in
life
meddling
with
him
he
gone
said
a
lady
to
me
in
the
far
west
of
the
south
of
ireland
while
the
poor
boy
whose
doom
was
thus
spoken
stood
by
listening
her
delicacy
did
not
equal
her
energy
in
doing
good
for
she
did
much
good
but
in
truth
it
was
difficult
to
be
delicate
when
the
hands
were
so
full
and
then
she
pointed
out
to
me
the
signs
on
the
lad
face
and
i
found
that
her
reading
was
correct
the
famine
was
not
old
enough
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
for
herbert
to
have
learned
all
this
or
he
would
have
known
that
there
was
no
hope
left
in
this
world
for
the
poor
creature
whom
he
saw
before
him
the
skin
of
her
cheek
had
fallen
and
her
mouth
was
dragged
and
the
mark
of
death
was
upon
her
but
the
agony
of
want
was
past
she
sat
there
listless
indifferent
hardly
capable
of
suffering
even
for
her
child
waiting
her
doom
unconsciously
as
he
had
entered
without
eliciting
a
word
from
her
so
might
he
have
departed
without
any
outward
sign
of
notice
but
this
would
have
been
impossible
on
his
part
i
have
come
in
out
of
the
rain
for
shelter
said
he
looking
down
on
her
out
o
the
rain
is
it
said
she
still
fixing
on
him
her
glassy
bright
eyes
yer
honour
welcome
thin
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
move
nor
show
any
of
those
symptoms
of
reverence
which
are
habitual
to
the
irish
when
those
of
a
higher
rank
enter
their
cabins
you
seem
to
be
very
poorly
off
here
said
herbert
looking
round
the
bare
walls
of
the
cabin
have
you
no
chair
and
no
bed
to
lie
on
no
said
she
and
no
fire
said
he
for
the
damp
and
chill
of
the
place
struck
through
to
his
bones
no
she
said
again
but
she
made
no
wail
as
to
her
wants
and
uttered
no
complaint
as
to
her
misery
and
are
you
living
here
by
yourself
without
furniture
or
utensils
of
any
kind
it
jist
as
yer
honour
sees
it
answered
she
for
a
while
herbert
stood
still
looking
round
him
for
the
woman
was
so
motionless
and
uncommunicative
that
he
hardly
knew
how
to
talk
to
her
that
she
was
in
the
lowest
depth
of
distress
was
evident
enough
and
it
behoved
him
to
administer
to
her
immediate
wants
before
he
left
her
but
what
could
he
do
for
one
who
seemed
to
be
so
indifferent
to
herself
he
stood
for
a
time
looking
round
him
till
he
could
see
through
the
gloom
that
there
was
a
bundle
of
straw
lying
in
the
dark
corner
beyond
the
hearth
and
that
the
straw
was
huddled
up
as
though
there
were
something
lying
under
it
seeing
this
he
left
the
bridle
of
his
horse
and
stepping
across
the
cabin
moved
the
straw
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
as
he
did
so
he
turned
his
back
from
the
wall
in
which
the
small
had
been
pierced
so
that
a
gleam
of
light
fell
upon
the
bundle
at
his
feet
and
he
could
see
that
the
body
of
a
child
was
lying
there
stripped
of
every
vestige
of
clothing
for
a
minute
or
two
he
said
nothing
hardly
indeed
knowing
how
to
speak
and
looking
from
the
corpselike
woman
back
to
the
lifelike
corpse
and
then
from
the
corpse
back
to
the
woman
as
though
he
expected
that
she
would
say
something
unasked
but
she
did
not
say
a
word
though
she
so
turned
her
head
that
her
eyes
rested
on
him
he
then
knelt
down
and
put
his
hand
upon
the
body
and
found
that
it
was
not
yet
stone
cold
the
child
apparently
had
been
about
four
years
old
while
that
still
living
in
her
arms
might
perhaps
be
half
that
age
was
she
your
own
asked
herbert
speaking
hardly
above
his
breath
yes
said
the
woman
she
was
my
own
own
little
kitty
but
there
was
no
tear
in
her
eye
or
gurgling
sob
audible
from
her
throat
and
when
did
she
die
he
asked
thin
and
i
do
jist
know
not
exactly
and
sinking
lower
down
upon
her
haunches
she
put
up
to
her
forehead
the
hand
with
which
she
had
supported
herself
on
the
floor
the
hand
which
was
not
occupied
with
the
baby
and
pushing
back
with
it
the
loose
hairs
from
her
face
tried
to
make
an
effort
at
thinking
she
was
alive
in
the
night
was
she
he
said
i
thin
she
was
yer
honour
was
broad
day
i
thinking
when
she
guv
over
moaning
she
war
that
way
when
he
went
away
and
who
he
jist
mike
thin
and
is
mike
your
husband
he
asked
she
was
not
very
willing
to
talk
but
it
appeared
at
last
that
mike
was
her
husband
and
that
having
become
a
cripple
through
rheumatism
he
had
not
been
able
to
work
on
the
roads
in
this
condition
he
and
his
should
of
course
have
gone
into
a
it
was
easy
enough
to
give
such
advice
in
such
cases
when
one
came
across
them
and
such
advice
when
given
at
that
time
was
usually
followed
but
there
were
so
many
who
had
no
advice
who
could
get
no
aid
who
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
themselves
this
wretched
man
had
succeeded
in
finding
some
one
who
would
give
him
his
food
food
enough
to
keep
himself
alive
for
such
work
as
he
could
do
in
spite
of
his
rheumatism
and
this
work
to
the
last
he
would
not
abandon
even
this
was
better
to
him
than
the
but
then
as
long
as
a
man
found
work
out
of
the
his
wife
and
children
would
not
be
admitted
into
it
they
would
not
be
admitted
if
the
fact
of
the
working
husband
was
known
the
rule
in
itself
was
salutary
as
without
it
a
man
could
work
earning
such
wages
as
were
adjudged
to
be
needful
for
a
family
and
at
the
same
time
send
his
wife
and
children
to
be
supported
on
the
rates
but
in
some
cases
such
as
this
it
pressed
very
cruelly
exceptions
were
of
course
made
in
such
cases
if
they
were
known
but
then
it
was
so
hard
to
know
them
this
man
mike
the
husband
of
that
woman
and
the
father
of
those
children
alive
and
dead
had
now
gone
to
his
work
leaving
his
home
without
one
morsel
of
food
within
it
and
the
wife
of
his
bosom
and
children
of
his
love
without
the
hope
of
getting
any
and
then
looking
closely
round
him
herbert
could
see
that
a
small
basin
or
bowl
lay
on
the
floor
near
her
capable
of
holding
perhaps
a
pint
and
on
lifting
it
he
saw
that
there
still
clung
to
it
a
few
grains
of
uncooked
indian
the
yellow
meal
as
it
was
called
her
husband
she
said
at
last
had
brought
home
with
him
in
his
cap
a
handful
of
this
flour
stolen
from
the
place
where
he
was
working
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
pound
then
worth
over
a
farthing
and
she
had
mixed
this
with
water
in
a
basin
and
this
was
the
food
which
had
sustained
her
or
rather
had
not
sustained
her
since
yesterday
morning
her
and
her
two
children
the
one
that
was
living
and
the
one
that
was
dead
such
was
her
story
told
by
her
in
the
fewest
of
words
and
then
he
asked
her
as
to
her
hopes
for
the
future
but
though
she
cared
as
it
seemed
but
little
for
the
past
for
the
future
she
cared
less
thin
an
i
do
jist
know
she
would
say
no
more
than
that
and
would
not
even
raise
her
voice
to
ask
for
alms
when
he
pitied
her
in
her
misery
but
with
her
the
agony
of
death
was
already
over
and
the
child
that
you
have
in
your
arms
he
said
is
it
not
cold
and
he
stood
close
over
her
and
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
the
baby
body
as
he
did
so
she
made
some
motion
as
though
to
arrange
the
clothing
closer
round
the
child
limbs
but
herbert
could
see
that
she
was
making
an
effort
to
hide
her
own
nakedness
it
was
the
only
effort
that
she
made
while
he
stood
there
beside
her
is
she
not
cold
he
said
again
when
he
had
turned
his
face
away
to
relieve
her
from
her
embarrassment
cowld
she
muttered
with
a
vacant
face
and
wondering
tone
of
voice
as
though
she
did
not
quite
understand
him
i
suppose
she
is
could
why
would
she
be
could
we
could
enough
if
that
all
but
still
she
did
not
stir
from
the
spot
on
which
she
sat
and
the
child
though
it
gave
from
time
to
time
a
low
moan
that
was
almost
inaudible
lay
still
in
her
arms
with
its
big
eyes
staring
into
vacancy
he
felt
that
he
was
stricken
with
horror
as
he
remained
there
in
the
cabin
with
the
dying
woman
and
the
naked
corpse
of
the
poor
dead
child
but
what
was
he
to
do
he
could
not
go
and
leave
them
without
succour
the
woman
had
made
no
plaint
of
her
suffering
and
had
asked
for
nothing
but
he
felt
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
abandon
her
without
offering
her
relief
nor
was
it
possible
that
he
should
leave
the
body
of
the
child
in
that
horribly
ghastly
state
so
he
took
from
his
pocket
his
silk
handkerchief
and
returning
to
the
corner
of
the
cabin
spread
it
as
a
covering
over
the
corpse
at
first
he
did
not
like
to
touch
the
small
naked
dwindled
remains
of
humanity
from
which
life
had
fled
but
gradually
he
overcame
his
disgust
and
kneeling
down
he
straightened
the
limbs
and
closed
the
eyes
and
folded
the
handkerchief
round
the
slender
body
the
mother
looked
on
him
the
while
shaking
her
head
slowly
as
though
asking
him
with
all
the
voice
that
was
left
to
her
whether
it
were
not
piteous
but
of
words
she
still
uttered
none
and
then
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
silver
coin
or
two
and
tendered
them
to
her
these
she
did
take
muttering
some
word
of
thanks
but
they
caused
in
her
no
emotion
of
joy
she
was
there
waiting
she
said
till
mike
should
return
and
there
she
would
still
wait
even
though
she
should
die
with
the
silver
in
her
hand
i
will
send
some
one
to
you
he
said
as
he
took
his
departure
some
one
that
shall
take
the
poor
child
and
bury
it
and
who
shall
move
you
and
the
other
one
into
the
workhouse
she
thanked
him
once
more
with
some
low
muttered
words
but
the
promise
brought
her
no
joy
and
when
the
succour
came
it
was
all
too
late
for
the
mother
and
the
two
children
never
left
the
cabin
till
they
left
it
together
wrapped
in
their
workhouse
shrouds
herbert
as
he
remounted
his
horse
and
rode
quietly
on
forgot
for
a
while
both
himself
and
clara
desmond
whatever
might
be
the
extent
of
his
own
calamity
how
could
he
think
himself
unhappy
after
what
he
had
seen
how
could
he
repine
at
aught
that
the
world
had
done
for
him
having
now
witnessed
to
how
low
a
state
of
misery
a
fellow
human
being
might
be
brought
could
he
after
that
dare
to
consider
himself
unfortunate
before
he
reached
desmond
court
he
did
make
some
arrangements
for
the
poor
woman
and
directed
that
a
cart
might
be
sent
for
her
so
that
she
might
be
carried
to
the
union
workhouse
at
kanturk
but
his
efforts
in
her
service
were
of
little
avail
people
then
did
not
think
much
of
a
dying
woman
and
were
in
no
special
hurry
to
obey
herbert
behest
a
woman
to
be
carried
to
the
union
is
it
for
fitzgerald
eh
what
fitzgerald
says
must
be
done
in
course
but
sure
av
done
before
dark
wo
that
be
time
enough
for
the
likes
of
her
but
had
they
flown
to
the
spot
on
the
wings
of
love
it
would
not
have
sufficed
to
prolong
her
life
one
day
her
doom
had
been
spoken
before
herbert
had
entered
the
cabin
chapter
xxxiv
farewell
he
was
two
hours
later
than
he
had
intended
as
he
rode
up
the
avenue
to
lady
desmond
gate
and
his
chief
thought
at
the
moment
was
how
he
should
describe
to
the
countess
the
scene
he
had
just
witnessed
why
describe
it
at
all
that
is
what
we
should
all
say
he
had
come
there
to
talk
about
other
things
about
other
things
which
must
be
discussed
and
which
would
require
all
his
wits
let
him
keep
that
poor
woman
on
his
mind
but
not
embarrass
himself
with
any
mention
of
her
for
the
present
this
no
doubt
would
have
been
wise
if
only
it
had
been
possible
but
out
of
the
full
heart
the
mouth
speaks
but
lady
desmond
had
not
witnessed
the
scene
which
i
have
attempted
to
describe
and
her
heart
therefore
was
not
full
of
it
and
was
not
inclined
to
be
so
filled
and
so
in
answer
to
exclamation
oh
lady
desmond
i
have
seen
such
a
sight
she
gave
him
but
little
encouragement
to
describe
it
and
by
her
coldness
reserve
and
dignity
soon
quelled
the
expression
of
his
feelings
the
earl
was
present
and
shook
hands
very
cordially
with
herbert
when
he
entered
the
room
and
he
being
more
susceptible
as
being
younger
and
not
having
yet
become
habituated
to
the
famine
as
his
mother
was
did
express
some
eager
sympathy
he
would
immediately
go
down
or
send
fahy
with
the
car
and
have
her
brought
up
and
saved
but
his
mother
had
other
work
to
do
and
soon
put
a
stop
to
all
this
fitzgerald
said
she
speaking
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
and
with
much
dignity
of
demeanour
as
you
and
lady
clara
both
wish
to
see
each
other
before
you
leave
the
country
and
as
you
have
known
each
other
so
intimately
and
considering
all
the
circumstances
i
have
not
thought
it
well
absolutely
to
forbid
an
interview
but
i
do
doubt
its
expediency
i
do
indeed
and
lord
desmond
who
feels
for
your
late
misfortune
as
we
all
do
perfectly
agrees
with
me
he
thinks
that
it
would
be
much
wiser
for
you
both
to
have
parted
without
the
pain
of
a
meeting
seeing
how
impossible
it
is
that
you
should
ever
be
more
to
each
other
than
you
are
now
and
then
she
appealed
to
her
son
who
stood
by
looking
not
quite
so
wise
nor
even
quite
so
decided
as
his
mother
words
would
seem
to
make
him
well
yes
upon
my
word
i
do
see
how
it
to
be
said
the
young
earl
i
am
deuced
sorry
for
it
for
one
and
i
wish
i
was
well
off
so
that
i
could
give
clara
a
pot
of
money
and
then
i
should
not
care
so
much
about
your
not
being
the
baronet
i
am
sure
you
must
see
fitzgerald
and
i
know
that
you
do
see
it
because
you
have
very
properly
said
so
that
a
marriage
between
you
and
lady
clara
is
now
impossible
for
her
such
an
engagement
would
be
very
bad
very
bad
indeed
but
for
you
it
would
be
utter
ruin
indeed
it
would
be
ruin
for
you
both
unencumbered
as
you
will
be
and
with
the
good
connection
which
you
will
have
and
with
your
excellent
talents
it
will
be
quite
within
your
reach
to
win
for
yourself
a
high
position
but
with
you
as
with
other
gentlemen
who
have
to
work
their
way
marriage
must
come
late
in
life
unless
you
marry
an
heiress
this
i
think
is
thoroughly
understood
by
all
people
in
our
position
and
i
am
sure
that
it
is
understood
by
your
excellent
mother
for
whom
i
always
had
and
still
have
the
most
unfeigned
respect
as
this
is
so
undoubtedly
the
case
and
as
i
can
not
of
course
consent
that
lady
clara
should
remain
hampered
by
an
engagement
which
would
in
all
human
probability
hang
over
the
ten
best
years
of
her
life
i
thought
it
wise
that
you
should
not
see
each
other
i
have
however
allowed
myself
to
be
overruled
and
now
i
must
only
trust
to
your
honour
forbearance
and
prudence
to
protect
my
child
from
what
might
possibly
be
the
ill
effects
of
her
own
affectionate
feelings
that
she
is
romantic
enthusiastic
to
a
fault
i
should
perhaps
rather
call
it
i
need
not
tell
you
she
thinks
that
your
misfortune
demands
from
her
a
sacrifice
of
herself
but
you
i
know
will
feel
that
even
were
such
a
sacrifice
available
to
you
it
would
not
become
you
to
accept
it
because
you
have
fallen
you
will
not
wish
to
drag
her
down
more
especially
as
you
can
rise
again
and
she
could
not
so
spoke
the
countess
with
much
worldly
wisdom
and
with
considerable
tact
in
adjusting
her
words
to
the
object
which
she
had
in
view
herbert
as
he
stood
before
her
silent
during
the
period
of
her
oration
did
feel
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
give
up
his
love
and
go
away
in
utter
solitude
of
heart
to
those
dingy
studies
which
prendergast
was
preparing
for
him
his
love
or
rather
the
assurance
of
clara
love
had
been
his
great
consolation
but
what
right
had
he
with
all
the
advantages
of
youth
and
health
and
friends
and
education
to
require
consolation
and
then
from
moment
to
moment
he
thought
of
the
woman
whom
he
had
left
in
the
cabin
and
confessed
that
he
did
not
dare
to
call
himself
unhappy
he
had
listened
attentively
although
he
did
thus
think
of
other
eloquence
besides
that
of
the
countess
of
the
eloquence
of
that
silent
solitary
dying
woman
but
when
she
had
done
he
hardly
knew
what
to
say
for
himself
she
did
make
him
feel
that
it
would
be
ungenerous
in
him
to
persist
in
his
engagement
but
then
again
clara
letters
and
his
sister
arguments
had
made
him
feel
that
it
was
impossible
to
abandon
it
they
pleaded
of
so
well
that
he
could
not
resist
them
and
the
countess
she
pleaded
so
well
as
to
world
prudence
that
he
could
not
resist
her
i
would
not
willingly
do
anything
to
injure
lady
clara
he
said
that
what
we
all
knew
said
the
young
earl
you
see
what
is
a
girl
to
do
like
her
love
in
a
cottage
is
all
very
well
and
all
that
and
as
for
riches
i
do
care
about
them
it
would
be
a
pity
if
i
did
for
i
shall
be
about
the
poorest
nobleman
in
the
three
kingdoms
i
suppose
but
a
chap
when
he
marries
should
have
something
should
he
now
to
tell
the
truth
the
earl
had
been
very
much
divided
in
his
opinions
since
he
had
come
home
veering
round
a
point
or
two
this
way
or
a
point
or
two
that
in
obedience
to
the
blast
of
eloquence
to
which
he
might
be
last
subjected
but
latterly
the
idea
had
grown
upon
him
that
clara
might
possibly
marry
owen
fitzgerald
there
was
about
owen
a
strange
fascination
which
all
felt
who
had
once
loved
him
to
the
world
he
was
rough
and
haughty
imperious
in
his
commands
and
exacting
even
in
his
fellowship
but
to
the
few
whom
he
absolutely
loved
whom
he
had
taken
into
his
heart
core
no
man
ever
was
more
tender
or
more
gracious
clara
though
she
had
resolved
to
banish
him
from
her
heart
had
found
it
impossible
to
do
so
till
misfortunes
had
given
him
a
charm
in
her
eyes
which
was
not
all
his
own
clara
mother
had
loved
him
had
loved
him
as
she
never
before
had
loved
and
now
she
loved
him
still
though
she
had
so
strongly
determined
that
her
love
should
be
that
of
a
mother
and
not
that
of
a
wife
and
the
young
earl
now
that
owen
name
was
again
rife
in
his
ears
remembered
all
the
pleasantness
of
former
days
he
had
never
again
found
such
a
companion
as
owen
had
been
he
had
met
no
other
friend
to
whom
he
could
talk
of
sport
and
a
man
outward
pleasures
when
his
mind
was
that
way
given
and
to
whom
he
could
also
talk
of
soft
inward
things
the
heart
feelings
and
aspirations
and
wants
owen
would
be
as
tender
with
him
as
a
woman
allowing
the
young
lad
arm
round
his
body
listening
to
words
which
the
outer
world
would
have
called
bosh
and
have
derided
as
girlish
so
at
least
thought
the
young
earl
to
himself
and
all
boys
long
to
be
allowed
utterance
occasionally
for
these
soft
tender
things
as
also
do
all
men
unless
the
devil
share
in
the
world
has
become
altogether
uppermost
with
them
and
the
young
lad
heart
hankered
after
his
old
friend
he
had
listened
to
his
sister
and
for
a
while
had
taken
her
part
but
his
mother
had
since
whispered
to
him
that
owen
would
now
be
the
better
suitor
the
preferable
and
that
in
fact
clara
loved
owen
the
best
though
she
felt
herself
bound
by
honour
to
his
kinsman
and
then
she
reminded
her
son
of
clara
former
love
for
owen
a
love
which
he
himself
had
witnessed
and
he
thought
of
the
day
when
with
so
much
regret
he
had
told
his
friend
that
he
was
unsuited
to
wed
with
an
earl
penniless
daughter
of
the
subsequent
pleasantness
which
had
come
with
herbert
arrival
he
had
seen
little
or
nothing
he
had
been
told
by
letter
that
herbert
fitzgerald
the
prosperous
heir
of
castle
richmond
was
to
be
his
future
and
he
had
been
satisfied
but
now
if
owen
could
return
how
pleasant
it
would
be
but
a
chap
when
he
marries
should
have
something
should
he
now
so
spoke
the
young
earl
his
mother
prudence
herbert
did
not
quite
like
this
interference
on
the
boy
part
was
he
to
explain
to
a
young
lad
from
eton
what
his
future
intentions
were
with
reference
to
his
mode
of
living
and
period
of
marriage
of
course
he
said
addressing
himself
to
the
countess
i
shall
not
insist
on
an
engagement
made
under
such
different
circumstances
nor
will
you
allow
her
to
do
so
through
a
romantic
feeling
of
generosity
said
the
countess
you
should
know
your
own
daughter
lady
desmond
better
than
i
do
he
answered
but
i
can
not
say
what
i
may
do
at
her
instance
till
i
shall
have
seen
her
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
allow
a
girl
of
her
age
to
talk
you
into
a
proceeding
which
you
know
to
be
wrong
i
will
allow
no
one
he
said
to
talk
me
into
a
proceeding
which
i
know
to
be
wrong
nor
will
i
allow
any
one
to
talk
me
out
of
a
proceeding
which
i
believe
to
be
right
and
then
having
uttered
these
somewhat
grandiloquent
words
he
shut
himself
up
as
though
there
were
no
longer
any
need
for
discussing
the
subject
my
poor
child
said
the
countess
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
as
though
she
did
not
intend
him
to
hear
them
my
poor
unfortunate
child
herbert
as
he
did
hear
them
thought
of
the
woman
in
the
cabin
and
of
her
misfortunes
and
of
her
children
come
patrick
continued
the
countess
it
is
perhaps
useless
for
us
to
say
anything
further
at
present
if
you
will
remain
here
fitzgerald
for
a
minute
or
two
i
will
send
lady
clara
to
wait
upon
you
and
then
curtsying
with
great
dignity
she
withdrew
and
the
young
earl
scuffled
out
after
her
mamma
he
said
as
he
went
he
is
determined
that
he
will
have
her
my
poor
child
answered
the
countess
and
if
i
were
in
his
place
i
should
be
determined
also
you
may
as
well
give
it
up
not
but
that
i
like
owen
a
thousand
times
the
best
herbert
did
wait
there
for
some
five
minutes
and
then
the
door
was
opened
very
gently
was
gently
closed
again
and
clara
desmond
was
in
the
room
he
came
towards
her
respectfully
holding
out
his
hand
that
he
might
take
hers
but
before
he
had
thought
of
how
she
would
act
she
was
in
his
arms
hitherto
of
all
betrothed
maidens
she
had
been
the
most
retiring
sometimes
he
had
thought
her
cold
when
she
had
left
the
seat
by
his
side
to
go
and
nestle
closely
by
his
sister
she
had
avoided
the
touch
of
his
hand
and
the
pressure
of
his
arm
and
had
gone
from
him
speechless
if
not
with
anger
then
with
dismay
when
he
had
carried
the
warmth
of
his
love
beyond
the
touch
of
his
hand
or
the
pressure
of
his
arm
but
now
she
rushed
into
his
embrace
and
hid
her
face
upon
his
shoulder
as
though
she
were
over
glad
to
return
to
the
heart
from
which
those
around
her
had
endeavoured
to
banish
her
was
he
or
was
he
not
to
speak
of
his
love
that
had
been
the
question
which
he
had
asked
himself
when
left
alone
there
for
those
five
minutes
with
the
eloquence
of
the
countess
ringing
in
his
ears
now
that
question
had
in
truth
been
answered
for
him
herbert
she
said
herbert
i
have
so
sorrowed
for
you
but
i
know
that
you
have
borne
it
like
a
man
she
was
thinking
of
what
he
had
now
half
forgotten
the
position
which
he
had
lost
those
hopes
which
had
all
been
shipwrecked
his
title
surrendered
to
another
and
his
lost
estates
she
was
thinking
of
them
as
the
loss
affected
him
but
he
he
had
reconciled
himself
to
all
that
unless
all
that
were
to
separate
him
from
his
promised
bride
dearest
clara
he
said
with
his
arm
close
round
her
waist
while
neither
anger
nor
dismay
appeared
to
disturb
the
sweetness
of
that
position
the
letter
which
you
wrote
me
has
been
my
chief
comfort
now
if
he
had
any
intention
of
liberating
clara
from
the
bond
of
her
engagement
if
he
really
had
any
feeling
that
it
behoved
him
not
to
involve
her
in
the
worldly
losses
which
had
come
upon
him
he
was
taking
a
very
bad
way
of
carrying
out
his
views
in
that
respect
instead
of
confessing
the
comfort
which
he
had
received
from
that
letter
and
holding
her
close
to
his
breast
while
he
did
confess
it
he
should
have
stood
away
from
her
quite
as
far
apart
as
he
had
done
from
the
countess
and
he
should
have
argued
with
her
showing
her
how
foolish
and
imprudent
her
letter
had
been
explaining
that
it
behoved
her
now
to
repress
her
feelings
and
teaching
her
that
daughters
as
well
as
housemaids
should
look
out
for
situations
which
would
suit
them
guided
by
prudence
and
a
view
to
the
wages
not
follow
the
dictates
of
impulse
and
of
the
heart
this
is
what
he
should
have
done
according
i
believe
to
the
views
of
most
men
and
women
instead
of
that
he
held
her
there
as
close
as
he
could
hold
her
and
left
her
to
do
the
most
of
the
speaking
i
think
he
was
right
according
to
my
ideas
woman
love
should
be
regarded
as
fair
prize
of
war
as
long
as
the
war
has
been
carried
on
with
due
adherence
to
the
recognized
law
of
nations
when
it
has
been
fairly
won
let
it
be
firmly
held
i
have
no
opinion
of
that
theory
of
giving
up
you
knew
that
i
would
not
abandon
you
did
you
not
know
it
say
that
you
knew
it
said
clara
and
then
she
insisted
on
having
an
answer
i
could
hardly
dare
to
think
that
there
was
so
much
happiness
left
for
me
said
herbert
then
you
were
a
traitor
to
your
love
sir
a
false
traitor
but
deep
as
was
the
offence
for
which
she
arraigned
him
it
was
clear
to
see
that
the
pardon
came
as
quick
as
the
conviction
and
was
emmeline
so
untrue
to
me
also
as
to
believe
that
emmeline
said
and
then
he
told
her
what
emmeline
had
said
dearest
dearest
emmeline
give
her
a
whole
of
love
from
me
now
mind
you
do
and
to
mary
too
and
remember
this
sir
that
i
love
emmeline
ten
times
better
than
i
do
you
twenty
times
because
she
knew
me
oh
if
she
had
mistrusted
me
and
do
you
think
that
i
mistrusted
you
yes
you
did
you
know
you
did
sir
you
wrote
and
told
me
so
and
now
this
very
day
you
come
here
to
act
as
though
you
mistrusted
me
still
you
know
you
have
only
you
have
not
the
courage
to
go
on
with
the
acting
and
then
he
began
to
defend
himself
showing
how
ill
it
would
have
become
him
to
have
kept
her
bound
to
her
engagements
had
she
feared
poverty
as
most
girls
in
her
position
would
have
feared
it
but
on
this
point
she
would
not
hear
much
from
him
lest
the
very
fact
of
her
hearing
it
should
make
it
seem
that
such
a
line
of
conduct
were
possible
to
her
you
know
nothing
about
most
girls
sir
or
about
any
i
am
afraid
not
even
about
one
and
if
most
girls
were
frightfully
heartless
which
they
are
not
what
right
had
you
to
liken
me
to
most
girls
emmeline
knew
better
and
why
could
not
you
take
her
as
a
type
of
most
girls
you
have
behaved
very
badly
master
herbert
and
you
know
it
and
nothing
on
earth
shall
make
me
forgive
you
nothing
but
your
promise
that
you
will
not
so
misjudge
me
any
more
and
then
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
and
her
face
was
again
hidden
on
his
shoulder
it
was
not
very
probable
that
after
such
a
commencement
the
interview
would
terminate
in
a
manner
favourable
to
the
wishes
of
the
countess
clara
swore
to
her
lover
that
she
had
given
him
all
that
she
had
to
give
her
heart
and
will
and
very
self
and
swore
also
that
she
could
not
and
would
not
take
back
the
gift
she
would
remain
as
she
was
now
as
long
as
he
thought
proper
and
would
come
to
him
whenever
he
should
tell
her
that
his
home
was
large
enough
for
them
both
and
so
that
matter
was
settled
between
them
then
she
had
much
to
say
about
his
mother
and
sisters
and
a
word
too
about
his
poor
father
and
now
that
it
was
settled
between
them
so
fixedly
that
come
what
might
they
were
to
float
together
in
the
same
boat
down
the
river
of
life
she
had
a
question
or
two
also
to
ask
and
her
approbation
to
give
or
to
withhold
as
to
his
future
prospects
he
was
not
to
think
she
told
him
of
deciding
on
anything
without
at
any
rate
telling
her
so
he
had
to
explain
to
her
all
the
family
plans
making
her
know
why
he
had
decided
on
the
law
as
his
own
path
to
fortune
and
asking
for
and
obtaining
her
consent
to
all
his
proposed
measures
in
this
way
her
view
of
the
matter
became
more
and
more
firmly
adopted
as
that
which
should
be
the
view
resolutely
to
be
taken
by
them
both
the
countess
had
felt
that
that
interview
would
be
fatal
to
her
and
she
had
been
right
but
how
could
she
have
prevented
it
twenty
times
she
had
resolved
that
she
would
prevent
it
but
twenty
times
she
had
been
forced
to
confess
that
she
was
powerless
to
do
so
in
these
days
a
mother
even
can
only
exercise
such
power
over
a
child
as
public
opinion
permits
her
to
use
mother
it
was
you
who
brought
us
together
and
you
can
not
separate
us
now
that
had
always
been
clara
argument
leaving
the
countess
helpless
except
as
far
as
she
could
work
on
herbert
generosity
that
she
had
tried
and
as
we
have
seen
been
foiled
there
also
if
only
she
could
have
taken
her
daughter
away
while
the
castle
richmond
family
were
still
mersed
in
the
bitter
depth
of
their
suffering
at
that
moment
when
the
blows
were
falling
on
them
then
indeed
she
might
have
done
something
but
she
was
not
like
other
titled
mothers
in
such
a
step
as
this
she
was
absolutely
without
the
means
thus
talking
together
they
remained
closeted
for
a
most
unconscionable
time
clara
had
had
her
purpose
to
carry
out
and
to
herbert
the
moments
had
been
too
precious
to
cause
him
any
regret
as
they
passed
but
now
at
last
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
lady
desmond
without
waiting
for
an
answer
to
it
entered
the
room
clara
immediately
started
from
her
seat
not
as
though
she
were
either
guilty
or
tremulous
but
with
a
brave
resolve
to
go
on
with
her
purposed
plan
mamma
she
said
it
is
fixed
now
it
can
not
be
altered
now
what
is
fixed
clara
herbert
and
i
have
renewed
our
engagement
and
nothing
must
now
break
it
unless
we
die
fitzgerald
if
this
be
true
your
conduct
to
my
daughter
has
been
unmanly
as
well
as
ungenerous
lady
desmond
it
is
true
and
i
think
that
my
conduct
is
neither
unmanly
nor
ungenerous
your
own
relations
are
against
you
sir
what
relations
asked
clara
sharply
i
am
not
speaking
to
you
clara
your
absurdity
and
romance
are
so
great
that
i
can
not
speak
to
you
what
relations
herbert
again
asked
clara
for
she
would
not
for
the
world
have
had
lady
fitzgerald
against
her
lady
desmond
has
i
believe
seen
my
aunt
letty
two
or
three
times
lately
i
suppose
she
must
mean
her
oh
said
clara
turning
away
as
though
she
were
now
satisfied
and
then
herbert
escaping
from
the
house
as
quickly
as
he
could
rode
home
with
a
renewal
of
that
feeling
of
triumph
which
he
had
once
enjoyed
before
when
returning
from
desmond
court
to
castle
richmond
on
the
next
day
herbert
started
for
london
the
parting
was
sad
enough
and
the
occasion
of
it
was
such
that
it
could
hardly
be
otherwise
i
am
quite
sure
of
one
thing
he
said
to
his
sister
emmeline
i
shall
never
see
castle
richmond
again
and
indeed
one
may
say
that
small
as
might
be
his
chance
of
doing
so
his
wish
to
do
so
must
be
still
less
there
could
be
no
possible
inducement
to
him
to
come
back
to
a
place
which
had
so
nearly
been
his
own
and
the
possession
of
which
he
had
lost
in
so
painful
a
manner
every
tree
about
the
place
every
path
across
the
wide
park
every
hedge
and
ditch
and
hidden
leafy
corner
had
had
for
him
a
special
interest
for
they
had
all
been
his
own
but
all
that
was
now
over
they
were
not
only
not
his
own
but
they
belonged
to
one
who
was
mounting
into
his
seat
of
power
over
his
head
he
had
spent
the
long
evening
before
his
last
dinner
in
going
round
the
whole
demesne
alone
so
that
no
eye
should
witness
what
he
felt
none
but
those
who
have
known
the
charms
of
a
early
in
life
can
conceive
the
intimacy
to
which
a
man
attains
with
all
the
various
trifling
objects
round
his
own
locality
how
he
knows
the
bark
of
every
tree
and
the
bend
of
every
bough
how
he
has
marked
where
the
rich
grass
grows
in
tufts
and
where
the
poorer
soil
is
always
dry
and
bare
how
he
watches
the
nests
of
the
rooks
and
the
holes
of
the
rabbits
and
has
learned
where
the
thrushes
build
and
can
show
the
branch
on
which
the
linnet
sits
all
these
things
had
been
dear
to
herbert
and
they
all
required
at
his
hand
some
last
farewell
every
dog
too
he
had
to
see
and
to
lay
his
hand
on
the
neck
of
every
horse
this
making
of
his
final
adieu
under
such
circumstances
was
melancholy
enough
and
then
too
later
in
the
evening
after
dinner
all
the
servants
were
called
into
the
parlour
that
he
might
shake
hands
with
them
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
had
not
hoped
as
lately
as
three
months
since
that
he
or
she
would
live
to
call
herbert
fitzgerald
master
indeed
he
had
already
been
their
master
their
young
master
all
irish
servants
especially
love
to
pay
respect
to
the
young
masther
but
herbert
now
was
to
be
their
master
no
longer
and
the
probability
was
that
he
would
never
see
one
of
them
again
he
schooled
himself
to
go
through
the
ordeal
with
a
manly
gait
and
with
dry
eyes
and
he
did
it
but
their
eyes
were
not
dry
not
even
those
of
the
men
jones
and
a
favourite
girl
whom
the
young
ladies
patronized
were
not
of
the
number
for
it
had
been
decided
that
they
should
follow
the
fortunes
of
their
mistress
but
richard
was
there
standing
a
little
apart
from
the
others
as
being
now
on
a
different
footing
he
was
to
go
also
but
before
the
scene
was
over
he
also
had
taken
to
sobbing
violently
i
wish
you
all
well
and
happy
said
herbert
making
his
little
speech
and
regret
deeply
that
the
intercourse
between
us
should
be
thus
suddenly
severed
you
have
served
me
and
mine
well
and
truly
and
it
is
hard
upon
you
now
that
you
should
be
bid
to
go
and
seek
another
home
elsewhere
it
is
that
we
mind
herbert
it
ai
that
as
frets
us
said
one
of
the
men
it
ai
that
at
all
at
all
said
richard
doing
chorus
but
that
yer
honour
should
be
robbed
of
what
is
yer
honour
own
but
you
all
know
that
we
can
not
help
it
continued
herbert
a
misfortune
has
come
upon
us
which
nobody
could
have
foreseen
and
therefore
we
are
obliged
to
part
with
our
old
friends
and
servants
at
the
word
friends
the
all
sobbed
and
we
is
your
frinds
and
true
frinds
too
wailed
the
cook
i
know
you
are
and
it
grieves
me
to
feel
that
i
shall
see
you
no
more
but
you
must
not
be
led
to
think
by
what
richard
says
that
anybody
is
depriving
me
of
that
which
ought
to
be
my
own
i
am
now
leaving
castle
richmond
because
it
is
not
my
own
but
justly
belongs
to
another
to
another
who
i
must
in
justice
tell
you
is
in
no
hurry
to
claim
his
inheritance
we
none
of
us
have
any
ground
for
displeasure
against
the
present
owner
of
this
place
my
cousin
sir
owen
fitzgerald
we
do
know
nothing
about
sir
owen
said
one
voice
and
do
want
said
another
convulsed
with
sobs
he
a
very
good
sort
of
young
gentleman
of
his
own
kind
no
doubt
said
richard
but
you
can
all
of
you
understand
continued
herbert
that
as
this
place
is
no
longer
our
own
we
are
obliged
to
leave
it
and
as
we
shall
live
in
a
very
different
way
in
the
home
to
which
we
are
going
we
are
obliged
to
part
with
you
though
we
have
no
reason
to
find
fault
with
any
one
among
you
i
am
going
morning
early
and
my
mother
and
sisters
will
follow
after
me
in
a
few
weeks
it
will
be
a
sad
thing
too
for
them
to
say
to
you
all
as
it
is
for
me
now
but
it
can
not
be
helped
god
bless
you
all
and
i
hope
that
you
will
find
good
masters
and
kind
mistresses
with
whom
you
may
live
comfortably
as
i
hope
you
have
done
here
we
ca
find
no
other
mistresses
like
her
leddyship
sobbed
out
the
senior
housemaid
there
ai
niver
such
a
one
in
the
county
cork
said
the
cook
in
a
week
of
sundays
you
would
hear
the
breath
out
of
her
above
her
own
swait
nathural
voice
i
driv
her
since
iver
began
richard
but
he
was
going
to
say
since
ever
she
was
married
but
he
remembered
that
this
allusion
would
be
unbecoming
so
he
turned
his
face
to
the
and
began
to
wail
bitterly
and
then
herbert
shook
hands
with
them
all
and
it
was
pretty
to
see
how
the
girls
wiped
their
hands
in
their
aprons
before
they
gave
them
to
him
and
how
they
afterwards
left
the
room
with
their
aprons
up
to
their
faces
the
women
walked
out
first
and
then
the
men
hanging
down
their
heads
and
muttering
as
they
went
each
some
little
prayer
that
fortune
and
prosperity
might
return
to
the
house
of
fitzgerald
the
property
might
go
but
according
to
their
views
herbert
was
always
and
always
would
be
the
head
of
the
house
and
then
last
of
all
richard
went
there
ai
one
of
herbert
as
guv
his
fist
to
go
wid
yer
and
think
nothing
about
the
wages
he
was
to
start
very
early
and
his
packing
was
all
completed
that
night
i
do
so
wish
we
were
going
with
you
said
emmeline
sitting
in
his
room
on
the
top
of
a
corded
box
which
was
to
follow
him
by
some
slower
conveyance
and
i
do
so
wish
i
was
staying
with
you
said
he
what
is
the
good
of
staying
here
now
said
she
what
pleasure
can
there
be
in
it
i
hardly
dare
to
go
outside
the
house
door
for
fear
i
should
be
seen
but
why
we
have
done
nothing
that
we
need
be
ashamed
of
no
i
know
that
but
herbert
do
you
not
find
that
the
pity
of
the
people
is
hard
to
bear
it
is
written
in
their
eyes
and
meets
one
at
every
turn
we
shall
get
rid
of
that
very
soon
in
a
few
months
we
shall
be
clean
forgotten
i
do
not
know
about
being
forgotten
you
will
be
as
clean
forgotten
as
though
you
had
never
existed
and
all
these
servants
who
are
now
so
fond
of
us
in
three
time
will
be
just
as
fond
of
owen
fitzgerald
if
he
will
let
them
stay
here
it
the
way
of
the
world
that
herbert
should
have
indulged
in
a
little
morbid
misanthropy
on
such
an
occasion
was
not
surprising
but
i
take
leave
to
think
that
he
was
wrong
in
his
philosophy
we
do
make
new
friends
when
we
lose
our
old
friends
and
the
heart
is
capable
of
cure
as
is
the
body
were
it
not
so
how
terrible
would
be
our
fate
in
this
world
but
we
are
so
apt
to
find
fault
with
god
goodness
to
us
in
this
respect
arguing
of
others
if
not
of
ourselves
that
the
heart
once
widowed
should
remain
a
widow
through
all
time
i
for
one
think
that
the
heart
should
receive
its
new
spouses
with
what
alacrity
it
may
and
always
with
thankfulness
i
suppose
lady
desmond
will
let
us
see
clara
said
emmeline
of
course
you
must
see
her
if
you
knew
how
much
she
talks
about
you
you
would
not
think
of
leaving
ireland
without
seeing
her
dear
clara
i
am
sure
she
does
not
love
me
better
than
i
do
her
but
suppose
that
lady
desmond
wo
let
us
see
her
and
i
know
that
it
will
be
so
that
grave
old
man
with
the
bald
head
will
come
out
and
say
that
lady
clara
is
not
at
home
and
then
we
shall
have
to
leave
without
seeing
her
but
it
does
not
matter
with
her
as
it
might
with
others
for
i
know
that
her
heart
will
be
with
us
if
you
write
beforehand
to
say
that
you
are
coming
and
explain
that
you
are
doing
so
to
say
then
i
think
they
will
admit
you
yes
and
the
countess
would
take
care
to
be
there
so
that
i
could
not
say
one
word
to
clara
about
you
oh
herbert
i
would
give
anything
if
i
could
have
her
here
for
one
day
only
for
one
day
but
when
they
talked
it
over
they
both
of
them
decided
that
this
would
not
be
practicable
clara
could
not
stay
away
from
her
own
house
without
her
mother
leave
and
it
was
not
probable
that
her
mother
would
give
her
permission
to
stay
at
castle
richmond
chapter
xxxv
herbert
fitzgerald
in
london
on
the
following
morning
the
whole
household
was
up
and
dressed
very
early
lady
fitzgerald
the
poor
lady
made
many
futile
attempts
to
drop
her
title
but
hitherto
without
any
shadow
of
success
lady
fitzgerald
was
down
in
the
breakfast
parlour
at
seven
as
also
were
aunt
letty
and
mary
and
emmeline
herbert
had
begged
his
mother
not
to
allow
herself
to
be
disturbed
alleging
that
there
was
no
cause
seeing
that
they
all
so
soon
would
meet
in
london
but
she
was
determined
that
she
would
superintend
his
last
meal
at
castle
richmond
the
servants
brought
in
the
trays
with
melancholy
silence
and
now
that
the
absolute
moment
of
parting
had
come
the
girls
could
not
speak
lest
the
tears
should
come
and
choke
them
it
was
not
that
they
were
about
to
part
with
him
that
parting
would
only
be
for
a
month
but
he
was
now
about
to
part
from
all
that
ought
to
have
been
his
own
he
sat
down
at
the
table
in
his
accustomed
place
with
a
forced
smile
on
his
face
but
without
a
word
and
his
sisters
put
before
him
his
cup
of
tea
and
the
slice
of
ham
that
had
been
cut
for
him
and
his
portion
of
bread
that
he
was
making
an
effort
they
all
saw
he
bowed
his
head
down
over
the
tea
to
sip
it
and
took
the
knife
in
his
hand
and
then
he
looked
up
at
them
for
he
knew
that
their
eyes
were
on
him
he
looked
up
at
them
to
show
that
he
could
still
endure
it
but
alas
he
could
not
endure
it
the
struggle
was
too
much
for
him
he
pushed
his
plate
violently
from
him
into
the
middle
of
the
table
and
dropping
his
head
upon
his
hands
he
burst
forth
into
audible
lamentations
oh
my
friends
be
not
hard
on
him
in
that
he
was
thus
weeping
like
a
woman
it
was
not
for
his
lost
wealth
that
he
was
wailing
nor
even
for
the
name
or
splendour
that
could
be
no
longer
his
nor
was
it
for
his
father
memory
though
he
had
truly
loved
his
father
nor
for
his
mother
sorrow
or
the
tragedy
of
her
life
history
for
none
of
these
things
were
his
tears
flowing
and
his
sobs
coming
so
violently
that
it
nearly
choked
him
to
repress
them
nor
could
he
himself
have
said
why
he
was
weeping
it
was
the
hundred
small
things
from
which
he
was
parting
for
ever
that
thus
disturbed
him
the
chair
on
which
he
sat
the
carpet
on
the
floor
the
table
on
which
he
leaned
the
dull
old
picture
of
his
over
the
fireplace
they
were
all
his
old
familiar
friends
they
were
all
part
of
castle
richmond
of
that
castle
richmond
which
he
might
never
be
allowed
to
see
again
his
mother
and
sisters
came
to
him
hanging
over
him
and
they
joined
their
tears
together
do
not
tell
her
that
i
was
like
this
said
he
at
last
she
will
love
you
the
better
for
it
if
she
has
a
true
woman
heart
within
her
breast
said
his
mother
as
true
a
heart
as
ever
breathed
said
emmeline
through
her
sobs
and
then
they
pressed
him
to
eat
but
it
was
in
vain
he
knew
that
the
food
would
choke
him
if
he
attempted
it
so
he
gulped
down
the
cup
of
tea
and
with
one
kiss
to
his
mother
he
rushed
from
them
refusing
aunt
letty
proffered
embrace
passing
through
the
line
of
servants
without
another
word
to
one
of
them
and
burying
himself
in
the
which
was
to
carry
him
the
first
stage
on
his
melancholy
journey
it
was
a
melancholy
journey
all
through
from
the
time
that
he
left
the
door
at
castle
richmond
that
was
no
longer
his
own
till
he
reached
the
euston
station
in
london
he
spoke
no
word
to
any
one
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
his
travelling
nothing
could
be
more
sad
than
the
prospect
of
his
residence
in
london
not
that
he
was
without
friends
there
for
he
belonged
to
a
fashionable
club
to
which
he
could
still
adhere
if
it
so
pleased
him
and
had
all
his
old
oxford
comrades
to
fall
back
upon
if
that
were
of
any
service
to
him
but
how
is
a
man
to
walk
into
his
club
who
yesterday
was
known
as
his
father
eldest
son
and
the
heir
to
a
baronetcy
and
twelve
thousand
a
year
and
who
is
known
as
nobody
son
and
the
heir
to
nothing
men
would
feel
so
much
for
him
and
pity
him
so
deeply
that
was
the
worst
feature
of
his
present
position
he
could
hardly
dare
to
show
himself
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
till
the
newness
of
his
tragedy
was
worn
off
prendergast
had
taken
lodgings
for
him
in
which
he
was
to
remain
till
he
could
settle
himself
in
the
same
house
with
his
mother
and
this
house
in
which
they
were
all
to
live
had
also
been
taken
up
in
that
cheerful
locality
near
called
wood
road
the
cab
fares
to
which
from
any
central
part
of
london
are
so
very
ruinous
but
that
house
was
not
yet
ready
and
so
he
went
into
lodgings
in
lincoln
inn
fields
prendergast
had
chosen
this
locality
because
it
was
near
the
chambers
of
that
great
chancery
barrister
mr
die
under
whose
beneficent
wing
herbert
fitzgerald
was
destined
to
learn
all
the
mysteries
of
the
chancery
bar
the
sanctuary
of
mr
die
wig
was
in
stone
buildings
immediately
close
to
that
milky
way
of
whose
separate
courts
cluster
about
the
old
chapel
of
lincoln
inn
and
here
was
herbert
to
sit
studious
for
the
next
three
years
to
sit
there
instead
of
at
the
various
relief
committees
in
the
vicinity
of
kanturk
and
why
could
he
not
be
as
happy
at
the
one
as
at
the
other
would
not
mr
die
be
as
amusing
as
townsend
and
the
arguments
of
stuart
court
quite
as
instructive
as
those
heard
in
the
committee
room
at
gortnaclough
on
the
morning
of
his
arrival
in
london
he
drove
to
his
lodgings
and
found
a
note
there
from
prendergast
asking
him
to
dinner
on
that
day
and
promising
to
take
him
to
mr
die
on
the
following
morning
prendergast
kept
a
bachelor
house
in
bloomsbury
square
not
very
far
from
lincoln
inn
just
across
holborn
as
all
londoners
know
and
there
he
would
expect
herbert
at
seven
i
will
not
ask
any
one
to
meet
you
he
said
because
you
will
be
tired
after
your
journey
and
perhaps
more
inclined
to
talk
to
me
than
to
strangers
prendergast
was
one
of
those
people
who
think
that
a
spacious
substantial
house
in
bloomsbury
square
at
a
rent
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
is
better
worth
having
than
a
narrow
lath
and
plaster
tenement
at
nearly
double
the
price
out
westward
of
the
parks
a
quite
new
man
is
necessarily
afraid
of
such
a
locality
as
bloomsbury
square
for
he
has
no
chance
of
getting
any
one
into
his
house
if
he
do
not
live
westward
who
would
dine
with
jones
in
woburn
terrace
unless
he
had
known
jones
all
his
days
or
unless
jones
were
known
as
a
top
sawyer
in
some
walk
of
life
but
prendergast
was
well
enough
known
to
his
old
friends
to
be
allowed
to
live
where
he
pleased
and
he
was
not
very
anxious
to
add
to
their
number
by
any
new
fashionable
allurements
herbert
sent
over
to
bloomsbury
square
to
say
that
he
would
be
there
at
seven
and
then
sat
himself
down
in
his
new
lodgings
it
was
but
a
dingy
abode
consisting
of
a
narrow
looking
out
into
the
big
square
from
over
a
covered
archway
and
a
narrower
bedroom
looking
backwards
into
a
dull
crooked
street
nothing
he
thought
could
be
more
melancholy
than
such
a
home
but
then
what
did
it
signify
his
days
would
be
passed
in
mr
chambers
and
his
evenings
would
be
spent
over
his
law
books
with
closed
windows
and
copious
burnings
of
the
midnight
oil
for
herbert
had
wisely
resolved
that
hard
work
and
hard
work
alone
could
mitigate
the
misery
of
his
present
position
but
he
had
no
work
for
the
present
day
he
could
not
at
once
unpack
his
portmanteau
and
begin
his
law
studies
on
the
moment
it
was
about
noon
when
he
had
completed
the
former
preparation
and
eaten
such
breakfast
as
his
new
london
landlady
had
gotten
for
him
and
the
breakfast
had
not
of
itself
been
bad
for
mrs
whereas
had
been
a
daughter
of
themis
all
her
life
waiting
upon
scions
of
the
law
since
first
she
had
been
able
to
run
for
a
of
milk
she
had
been
laundress
on
a
stairs
for
ten
years
having
married
a
law
apprentice
and
now
she
owned
the
dingy
house
over
the
covered
way
and
let
her
own
lodgings
with
her
own
furniture
nor
was
she
often
without
friends
who
would
recommend
her
zeal
and
honesty
and
make
excuse
for
the
imperiousness
of
her
ways
and
the
too
great
fluency
of
her
by
no
means
servile
tongue
oh
said
herbert
i
beg
your
pardon
but
might
i
ask
your
name
no
offence
sir
none
in
life
my
name
whereas
martha
whereas
and
been
now
for
year
there
many
of
the
about
the
courts
here
as
do
know
of
me
and
i
knew
of
them
too
before
they
carried
their
wigs
so
grandly
my
husband
that
whereas
you
find
him
at
the
little
stationer
shop
outside
the
gate
in
carey
street
you
know
him
some
of
these
days
i
go
bail
if
you
going
to
mr
die
anyways
you
know
his
handwrite
tea
to
your
liking
sir
i
gets
cream
for
gentlemen
sir
unless
they
tells
me
not
milk
a
sir
cream
tuppence
three
difference
hai
it
sir
so
now
you
can
do
as
you
pleases
and
if
you
like
bacon
and
heggs
to
your
breakfastesses
you
only
to
say
the
words
but
then
the
heggs
hai
heggs
that
the
truth
and
they
hai
chickens
but
betwixt
the
two
and
so
she
went
on
during
the
whole
time
that
he
was
eating
moving
about
from
place
to
place
and
putting
back
into
the
places
which
she
had
chosen
for
them
anything
which
he
had
chanced
to
move
now
dusting
a
bit
of
furniture
with
her
apron
and
then
leaning
on
the
back
of
a
chair
while
she
asked
him
some
question
as
to
his
habits
and
future
mode
of
living
she
also
wore
a
bonnet
apparently
as
a
customary
part
of
her
house
costume
and
herbert
could
not
help
thinking
that
she
looked
very
like
his
aunt
letty
but
when
she
had
gone
and
taken
the
breakfast
things
with
her
then
began
the
tedium
of
the
day
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
he
had
no
means
of
commencing
his
life
in
london
until
he
had
been
with
prendergast
or
mr
die
and
so
new
did
it
all
feel
to
him
so
strange
and
wonderful
that
he
hardly
dared
to
go
out
of
the
house
by
himself
and
wander
about
the
premises
of
the
inn
he
was
not
absolutely
a
stranger
in
london
for
he
had
been
elected
at
a
club
before
he
had
left
oxford
and
had
been
up
in
town
twice
staying
on
each
occasion
some
few
weeks
had
he
therefore
been
asked
about
the
metropolis
some
four
months
since
at
castle
richmond
he
would
have
professed
that
he
knew
it
well
starting
from
pall
mall
he
could
have
gone
to
any
of
the
central
theatres
or
to
the
parks
or
to
the
houses
of
parliament
or
to
the
picture
galleries
in
june
but
now
in
that
dingy
big
square
he
felt
himself
to
be
absolutely
a
stranger
and
when
he
did
venture
out
he
watched
the
corners
in
order
that
he
might
find
his
way
back
without
asking
questions
and
then
he
roamed
round
the
squares
and
about
the
little
courts
and
found
out
where
were
stone
buildings
so
called
because
they
are
so
dull
and
dead
and
and
as
his
courage
increased
he
made
his
way
into
one
of
the
courts
and
stood
up
for
a
while
on
an
uncomfortable
narrow
step
so
that
he
might
watch
the
proceedings
as
they
went
on
and
it
all
seemed
to
him
to
be
dull
and
deadly
there
was
no
life
and
amusement
such
as
he
had
seen
at
the
assize
court
in
county
cork
when
he
was
sworn
in
as
one
of
the
grand
jury
there
the
gentlemen
in
wigs
for
on
the
munster
circuit
they
do
wear
wigs
or
at
any
rate
did
then
laughed
and
winked
and
talked
together
joyously
and
when
a
roman
catholic
fisherman
from
berehaven
was
put
into
the
dock
for
destroying
the
boat
and
nets
of
a
protestant
fisherman
from
dingle
in
county
kerry
who
had
chanced
to
come
that
way
not
fishing
at
all
at
all
yer
honour
but
just
souping
as
the
papist
prisoner
averred
with
great
emphasis
the
gentlemen
of
the
robe
had
gone
to
the
fight
with
all
the
animation
and
courage
of
matadors
and
picadors
in
a
it
was
delightful
to
see
the
way
in
which
roman
catholic
skill
combated
protestant
fury
with
a
substratum
below
of
irish
fun
which
showed
to
everybody
that
it
was
not
all
quite
in
earnest
that
the
great
and
the
great
fitzberesford
could
sit
down
together
afterwards
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
over
their
modicum
of
claret
in
the
barristers
room
at
the
imperial
hotel
and
then
the
judge
had
added
to
the
life
of
the
meeting
helping
to
bamboozle
and
make
miserable
a
wretch
of
a
witness
who
had
been
caught
in
the
act
of
seeing
the
boat
smashed
with
a
fragment
of
rock
and
was
now
in
consequence
being
impaled
alive
by
his
lordship
assistance
what
do
you
say
your
name
is
demanded
his
lordship
angrily
rowland
houghton
said
the
miserable
stray
saxon
tourist
who
had
so
unfortunately
strayed
that
way
on
the
occasion
what
repeated
the
judge
whose
ears
were
sharper
to
such
sounds
as
macgillycuddy
and
rowland
houghton
said
the
offender
in
his
distress
quicker
louder
and
perhaps
not
more
distinctly
than
before
what
does
the
man
say
said
the
judge
turning
his
head
down
towards
a
satellite
who
sat
on
a
bench
beneath
his
cushion
the
gentleman
appealed
to
pronounced
the
name
for
the
judge
hearing
with
a
full
rolling
irish
brogue
that
gave
great
delight
through
all
the
court
me
whereupon
his
lordship
threw
up
his
hands
in
dismay
oulan
outan
said
he
oulan
outan
i
never
heard
such
a
name
in
my
life
and
then
having
thoroughly
impaled
the
wicked
witness
and
added
materially
to
the
amusement
of
the
day
the
judge
wrote
down
the
name
in
his
book
and
there
it
is
to
this
day
no
doubt
oulan
outan
and
when
one
thinks
of
it
it
was
monstrous
that
an
english
witness
should
go
into
an
irish
law
court
with
such
a
name
as
rowland
houghton
but
here
in
the
dark
dingy
court
to
which
herbert
had
penetrated
in
lincoln
inn
there
was
no
such
life
as
this
here
whatever
skill
there
might
be
was
of
a
dark
subterranean
nature
quite
unintelligible
to
any
minds
but
those
of
experts
and
as
for
fury
or
fun
there
was
no
spark
either
of
one
or
of
the
other
the
judge
sat
back
in
his
seat
a
tall
handsome
speechless
man
not
asleep
for
his
eye
from
time
to
time
moved
slowly
from
the
dingy
barrister
who
was
on
his
legs
to
another
dingy
barrister
who
was
sitting
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ceiling
the
gentleman
who
was
in
the
act
of
pleading
had
a
huge
open
paper
in
his
hand
from
which
he
droned
forth
certain
legal
quiddities
of
the
dullest
and
most
uninteresting
nature
he
was
in
earnest
for
there
was
a
perpetual
energy
in
his
drone
as
a
droning
bee
might
drone
who
was
known
to
drone
louder
than
other
drones
but
it
was
a
continuous
energy
supported
by
perseverance
and
not
by
impulse
and
seemed
to
come
of
a
fixed
determination
to
continue
the
reading
of
that
paper
till
all
the
world
should
be
asleep
a
great
part
of
the
world
around
was
asleep
but
the
judge
eye
was
still
open
and
one
might
say
that
the
barrister
was
resolved
to
go
on
till
that
eye
should
have
become
closed
in
token
of
his
success
herbert
remained
there
for
an
hour
thinking
that
he
might
learn
something
that
would
be
serviceable
to
him
in
his
coming
legal
career
but
at
the
end
of
the
hour
the
same
thing
was
going
on
the
judge
eye
was
still
open
and
the
lawyer
drone
was
still
sounding
and
so
he
came
away
having
found
himself
absolutely
dozing
in
the
uncomfortable
position
in
which
he
was
standing
at
last
the
day
wore
away
and
at
seven
he
found
himself
in
prendergast
hall
in
bloomsbury
square
and
his
hat
and
umbrella
were
taken
away
from
him
by
an
old
servant
looking
very
much
like
prendergast
himself
having
about
him
the
same
look
of
the
stiffness
of
years
and
the
same
look
also
of
excellent
preservation
and
care
prendergast
is
in
the
library
sir
if
you
please
said
the
old
servant
and
so
saying
he
ushered
herbert
into
the
back
room
it
was
a
spacious
lofty
apartment
well
fitted
up
for
a
library
and
furnished
for
that
purpose
with
exceeding
care
such
a
room
as
one
does
not
find
in
the
flashy
new
houses
in
the
west
where
the
and
occupy
all
of
the
house
that
is
visible
but
then
how
few
of
those
who
live
in
flashy
new
houses
in
the
west
require
to
have
libraries
in
london
as
he
entered
the
room
prendergast
came
forward
to
meet
him
and
seemed
heartily
glad
to
see
him
there
was
a
cordiality
about
him
which
herbert
had
never
recognized
at
castle
richmond
and
an
appearance
of
enjoyment
which
had
seemed
to
be
almost
foreign
to
the
lawyer
nature
herbert
perhaps
had
not
calculated
as
he
should
have
done
that
prendergast
mission
in
ireland
had
not
admitted
of
much
enjoyment
prendergast
had
gone
there
to
do
a
job
of
work
and
that
he
had
done
very
thoroughly
but
he
certainly
had
not
enjoyed
himself
there
was
time
for
only
few
words
before
the
old
man
again
entered
the
room
announcing
dinner
and
those
few
words
had
no
reference
whatever
to
the
castle
richmond
sorrow
he
had
spoken
of
lodging
and
of
his
journey
and
a
word
or
two
of
mr
die
and
then
they
went
in
to
dinner
and
at
dinner
too
the
conversation
wholly
turned
upon
indifferent
matters
upon
reform
at
oxford
the
state
of
parties
and
of
the
peculiar
idiosyncrasies
of
the
irish
low
church
clergymen
on
all
of
which
subjects
herbert
found
that
prendergast
had
a
tolerably
strong
opinion
of
his
own
the
dinner
was
very
good
though
by
no
means
showy
as
might
have
been
expected
in
a
house
in
bloomsbury
square
and
the
wine
excellent
as
might
have
been
expected
in
any
house
inhabited
by
prendergast
and
then
when
the
dinner
was
over
and
the
old
servant
had
slowly
removed
his
last
tray
when
they
had
each
got
into
an
and
were
seated
at
properly
comfortable
distances
from
the
fire
prendergast
began
to
talk
freely
not
that
he
at
once
plunged
into
the
middle
of
the
old
history
or
began
with
lugubrious
force
to
recapitulate
the
horrors
that
were
now
partly
over
but
gradually
he
veered
round
to
those
points
as
to
which
he
thought
it
good
that
he
should
speak
before
setting
herbert
at
work
on
his
new
london
life
you
drink
claret
i
suppose
said
prendergast
as
he
adjusted
a
portion
of
the
table
for
their
evening
symposium
oh
yes
said
herbert
not
caring
very
much
at
that
moment
what
the
wine
was
you
find
that
pretty
good
a
good
deal
better
than
what
get
in
most
houses
in
london
nowadays
but
you
know
a
man
always
likes
his
own
wine
and
especially
an
old
man
herbert
said
something
about
it
being
very
good
but
did
not
give
that
attention
to
the
matter
which
prendergast
thought
that
it
deserved
indeed
he
was
thinking
more
about
mr
die
and
stone
buildings
than
about
the
wine
and
how
do
you
find
my
old
friend
mrs
whereas
asked
the
lawyer
she
seems
to
be
a
very
attentive
sort
of
woman
yes
rather
too
much
so
sometimes
people
do
say
that
she
never
knows
how
to
hold
her
tongue
but
she
wo
rob
you
nor
yet
poison
you
and
in
these
days
that
is
saying
a
very
great
deal
for
a
woman
in
london
and
then
there
was
a
pause
as
prendergast
sipped
his
wine
with
slow
complacency
and
we
are
to
go
to
mr
die
i
suppose
he
said
beginning
again
to
which
herbert
replied
that
he
would
be
ready
at
any
time
in
the
morning
that
might
be
suitable
the
sooner
you
get
into
harness
the
better
it
is
not
only
that
you
have
much
to
learn
but
you
have
much
to
forget
also
yes
said
herbert
i
have
much
to
forget
indeed
more
than
i
can
forget
i
afraid
mr
prendergast
there
is
i
fancy
no
sorrow
which
a
man
can
not
forget
that
is
as
far
as
the
memory
of
it
is
likely
to
be
painful
to
him
you
will
not
absolutely
cease
to
remember
castle
richmond
and
all
its
circumstances
you
will
still
think
of
the
place
and
all
the
people
whom
you
knew
there
but
you
will
learn
to
do
so
without
the
pain
which
of
course
you
now
suffer
that
is
what
i
mean
by
forgetting
oh
i
do
complain
sir
no
i
know
you
do
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i
am
so
anxious
to
see
you
happy
you
have
borne
the
whole
matter
so
well
that
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
will
be
able
to
live
happily
in
this
new
life
that
is
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
you
will
forget
castle
richmond
herbert
bethought
himself
of
clara
desmond
and
of
the
woman
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
cabin
and
reflected
that
even
at
present
he
had
no
right
to
be
unhappy
i
suppose
you
have
no
thought
of
going
back
to
ireland
said
prendergast
oh
none
in
the
least
on
the
whole
i
think
you
are
right
no
doubt
a
family
connection
is
a
great
assistance
to
a
barrister
and
there
would
be
reasons
which
would
make
attorneys
in
ireland
throw
business
into
your
hands
at
an
early
period
of
your
life
your
history
would
give
you
an
there
if
you
know
what
i
mean
oh
yes
perfectly
but
i
do
want
that
no
it
is
a
kind
of
assistance
which
in
my
opinion
a
man
should
not
desire
in
the
first
place
it
does
not
last
a
man
so
bouyed
up
is
apt
to
trust
to
such
support
instead
of
his
own
steady
exertions
and
the
firmest
of
friends
wo
stick
to
a
lawyer
long
if
he
can
get
better
law
for
his
money
elsewhere
there
should
be
no
friendship
in
such
matters
i
think
well
i
wo
say
that
but
the
friendship
should
come
of
the
service
not
the
service
of
the
friendship
good
hard
steady
and
enduring
work
work
that
does
not
demand
immediate
acknowledgment
and
reward
but
that
can
afford
to
look
forward
for
its
results
it
is
that
and
that
only
which
in
my
opinion
will
insure
to
a
man
permanent
success
it
is
hard
though
for
a
poor
man
to
work
so
many
years
without
an
income
said
herbert
thinking
of
lady
clara
desmond
not
hard
if
you
get
the
price
of
your
work
at
last
but
you
can
have
your
choice
a
moderate
fixed
income
can
now
be
had
by
any
barrister
early
in
life
by
any
barrister
of
fair
parts
and
sound
acquirements
there
are
more
barristers
now
filling
salaried
places
than
practising
in
the
courts
but
those
places
are
given
by
favour
no
not
so
generally
or
if
by
favour
by
that
sort
of
favour
which
is
as
likely
to
come
to
you
as
to
another
such
places
are
not
given
to
incompetent
young
men
because
their
fathers
and
mothers
ask
for
them
but
wo
you
fill
your
glass
i
am
doing
very
well
thank
you
you
do
better
if
you
fill
your
glass
and
let
me
have
the
bottle
back
but
you
are
thinking
of
the
good
old
historical
days
when
you
talk
of
barristers
having
to
wait
for
their
incomes
there
has
been
a
great
change
in
that
respect
for
the
better
as
you
of
course
will
think
a
man
is
taken
away
from
his
and
his
to
be
made
a
judge
a
little
law
and
a
great
fund
of
physical
strength
that
is
the
extent
of
the
demand
and
prendergast
plainly
showed
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
he
did
not
admire
the
wisdom
of
this
new
policy
of
which
he
spoke
but
i
suppose
a
man
must
work
five
years
before
he
can
earn
anything
said
herbert
still
despondingly
for
five
years
is
a
long
time
to
an
expectant
lover
fifteen
years
of
unpaid
labour
used
not
to
be
thought
too
great
a
price
to
pay
for
ultimate
success
said
prendergast
almost
sighing
at
the
degeneracy
of
the
age
but
men
in
those
days
were
ambitious
and
patient
and
now
they
are
ambitious
and
impatient
suggested
herbert
covetous
and
impatient
might
perhaps
be
the
truer
epithets
said
prendergast
with
grim
sarcasm
it
is
sad
for
a
man
to
feel
when
he
knows
that
he
is
fast
going
down
the
hill
of
life
that
the
experience
of
old
age
is
to
be
no
longer
valued
nor
its
wisdom
appreciated
the
elderly
man
of
this
day
thinks
that
he
has
been
robbed
of
his
chance
in
life
when
he
was
in
his
full
physical
vigour
he
was
not
old
enough
for
mental
success
he
was
still
winning
his
spurs
at
forty
but
at
fifty
so
does
the
world
change
he
learns
that
he
is
past
his
work
by
some
unconscious
and
unlucky
leap
he
has
passed
from
the
unripeness
of
youth
to
the
decay
of
age
without
even
knowing
what
it
was
to
be
in
his
prime
a
man
should
always
seize
his
opportunity
but
the
changes
of
the
times
in
which
he
has
lived
have
never
allowed
him
to
have
one
there
has
been
no
period
of
flood
in
his
tide
which
might
lead
him
on
to
fortune
while
he
has
been
waiting
patiently
for
high
water
the
ebb
has
come
upon
him
prendergast
himself
had
been
a
successful
man
and
his
regrets
therefore
were
philosophical
rather
than
practical
as
for
herbert
he
did
not
look
upon
the
question
at
all
in
the
same
light
as
his
elderly
friend
and
on
the
whole
was
rather
exhilarated
by
the
tone
of
prendergast
sarcasm
perhaps
prendergast
had
intended
that
such
should
be
its
effect
the
long
evening
passed
away
cosily
enough
leaving
on
herbert
mind
an
impression
that
in
choosing
to
be
a
barrister
he
had
certainly
chosen
the
noblest
walk
of
life
in
which
a
man
could
earn
his
bread
prendergast
did
not
promise
him
either
fame
or
fortune
nor
did
he
speak
by
any
means
in
high
enthusiastic
language
he
said
much
of
the
necessity
of
long
hours
of
tedious
work
of
amaryllis
left
by
herself
in
the
shade
and
of
ne√¶ra
locks
unheeded
but
nevertheless
he
spoke
in
a
manner
to
arouse
the
ambition
and
satisfy
the
longings
of
the
young
man
who
listened
to
him
there
were
much
wisdom
in
what
he
did
and
much
benevolence
also
and
then
at
about
eleven
herbert
having
sat
out
the
second
bottle
of
claret
betook
himself
to
his
bed
at
the
lodgings
over
the
covered
way
chapter
xxxvi
how
the
earl
was
won
it
was
not
quite
at
first
that
the
countess
could
explain
to
her
son
how
she
now
wished
that
owen
fitzgerald
might
become
her
she
had
been
so
steadfast
in
her
opposition
to
owen
when
the
earl
had
last
spoken
of
the
matter
and
had
said
so
much
of
the
wickedly
dissipated
life
which
owen
was
leading
that
she
feared
to
shock
the
boy
but
by
degrees
she
brought
the
matter
round
speaking
of
great
good
fortune
pointing
out
how
much
better
he
was
suited
for
riches
than
for
poverty
insisting
warmly
on
all
his
good
qualities
and
high
feelings
and
then
saying
at
last
as
it
were
without
thought
poor
clara
she
has
been
unfortunate
for
at
one
time
she
loved
owen
fitzgerald
much
better
than
she
will
ever
love
his
cousin
herbert
do
you
think
so
mother
i
am
sure
of
it
the
truth
is
patrick
you
do
not
understand
your
sister
and
indeed
it
is
hard
to
do
so
i
have
also
always
had
an
inward
fear
that
she
had
now
engaged
herself
to
a
man
whom
she
did
not
love
of
course
as
things
were
then
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
marry
owen
and
i
was
glad
to
break
her
off
from
that
feeling
but
she
never
loved
herbert
fitzgerald
why
she
is
determined
to
have
him
even
now
ah
yes
that
is
where
you
do
not
understand
her
now
at
this
special
moment
her
heart
is
touched
by
his
misfortune
and
she
thinks
herself
bound
by
her
engagement
to
sacrifice
herself
with
him
but
that
is
not
love
she
has
never
loved
any
one
but
owen
and
who
can
wonder
at
it
for
he
is
a
man
made
for
a
woman
to
love
the
earl
said
nothing
for
a
while
but
sat
balancing
himself
on
the
back
legs
of
his
chair
and
then
as
though
a
new
idea
had
struck
him
he
exclaimed
if
i
thought
that
mother
i
would
find
out
what
owen
thinks
of
it
himself
poor
owen
said
the
countess
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
what
he
thinks
and
then
she
left
the
room
not
wishing
to
carry
the
conversation
any
further
two
days
after
this
and
without
any
further
hint
from
his
mother
he
betook
himself
along
the
banks
of
the
river
to
hap
house
in
his
course
thither
he
never
let
his
horse
put
a
foot
upon
the
road
but
kept
low
down
upon
the
water
meadows
leaping
over
all
the
fences
as
he
had
so
often
done
with
the
man
whom
he
was
now
going
to
see
it
was
here
among
these
banks
that
he
had
received
his
earliest
lessons
in
horsemanship
and
they
had
all
been
given
by
owen
fitzgerald
it
had
been
a
thousand
pities
he
had
thought
that
owen
had
been
so
poor
as
to
make
it
necessary
for
them
all
to
discourage
that
love
affair
with
clara
he
would
have
been
so
delighted
to
welcome
owen
as
his
and
as
he
strode
along
over
the
ground
and
landed
himself
knowingly
over
the
crabbed
fences
he
began
to
think
how
much
pleasanter
the
country
would
be
for
him
if
he
had
a
downright
good
fellow
and
crack
sportsman
as
his
fast
friend
at
castle
richmond
sir
owen
fitzgerald
of
castle
richmond
he
would
be
the
man
to
whom
he
would
be
delighted
to
give
his
sister
clara
and
then
he
hopped
in
from
one
of
owen
fields
into
a
small
paddock
at
the
back
of
owen
house
and
seeing
one
of
the
about
the
place
asked
him
if
his
master
was
at
home
shure
an
he
here
thin
yer
honour
and
lord
desmond
could
hear
the
boy
whispering
it
the
young
lord
hisself
in
a
moment
owen
fitzgerald
was
standing
by
his
horse
side
it
was
the
first
time
that
owen
had
seen
one
of
the
family
since
the
news
had
been
spread
abroad
concerning
his
right
to
the
inheritance
of
castle
richmond
desmond
said
he
taking
the
lad
hand
with
one
of
his
and
putting
the
other
on
the
animal
neck
this
is
very
good
of
you
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
i
had
heard
that
you
were
in
the
country
yes
i
have
been
home
for
this
week
past
but
things
are
all
so
at
sixes
and
sevens
among
us
all
that
a
fellow
ca
go
and
do
just
what
he
would
like
owen
well
understood
what
he
meant
indeed
they
are
at
sixes
and
sevens
you
may
well
say
that
but
get
off
your
horse
old
fellow
and
come
into
the
house
why
what
a
lather
of
heat
the
mare
in
is
she
it
quite
dreadful
that
chap
of
ours
has
no
more
idea
of
condition
than
i
have
of
of
of
of
an
archbishop
i
just
trotted
along
the
fields
and
put
her
over
a
ditch
or
two
and
you
see
the
state
she
in
it
a
beastly
shame
i
know
of
old
what
your
trottings
are
desmond
and
what
a
ditch
or
two
means
you
been
at
every
bank
between
this
and
banteer
as
though
you
were
going
for
a
steeplechase
plate
upon
my
honour
owen
look
here
patsey
walk
that
mare
up
and
down
here
between
this
gate
and
that
post
till
the
big
sweat
has
all
dried
on
her
and
then
stick
to
her
with
a
whisp
of
straw
till
she
as
soft
as
silk
do
you
hear
patsey
said
that
he
did
hear
and
then
owen
throwing
his
arm
over
the
earl
shoulder
walked
slowly
towards
the
house
i
ca
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
old
boy
said
owen
pressing
his
young
friend
with
something
almost
like
an
embrace
you
will
hardly
believe
how
long
it
is
since
i
have
seen
a
face
that
i
cared
to
look
at
have
you
said
the
young
lord
wondering
he
knew
that
fitzgerald
had
now
become
heir
to
a
very
large
fortune
or
rather
the
possessor
of
that
fortune
and
he
could
not
understand
why
a
man
who
had
been
so
popular
while
he
was
poor
should
be
deserted
now
that
he
was
rich
no
indeed
have
i
not
things
are
all
at
sixes
and
sevens
as
you
say
let
me
see
donnellan
was
here
when
you
last
saw
me
and
i
was
soon
tired
of
him
when
things
became
serious
i
do
wonder
you
were
tired
of
him
but
desmond
how
your
mother
oh
she
very
well
these
are
bad
times
for
poor
people
like
us
you
know
and
your
sister
she
pretty
well
too
thank
you
and
then
there
was
a
pause
you
had
a
great
change
in
your
fortune
since
i
saw
you
have
you
not
said
the
earl
after
a
minute
or
two
and
there
it
occurred
to
him
for
the
first
time
that
having
refused
his
sister
to
this
man
when
he
was
poor
he
had
now
come
to
offer
her
to
him
when
he
was
rich
not
that
that
was
the
reason
he
said
to
himself
but
it
was
impossible
then
and
now
it
would
be
so
pleasant
it
is
a
sad
history
is
it
not
said
owen
very
sad
said
the
earl
remembering
however
that
he
had
ridden
over
there
with
his
heart
full
of
joy
of
joy
occasioned
by
that
very
catastrophe
which
now
following
his
friend
words
like
a
parrot
he
declared
to
be
so
very
sad
and
now
they
were
in
the
in
which
owen
usually
lived
and
were
both
standing
on
the
rug
as
two
men
always
do
stand
when
they
first
get
into
a
room
together
and
it
was
clear
to
see
that
neither
of
them
knew
how
to
break
at
once
into
the
sort
of
loving
genial
talk
which
each
was
longing
to
have
with
the
other
it
is
so
easy
to
speak
when
one
has
little
or
nothing
to
say
but
often
so
difficult
when
there
is
much
that
must
be
said
and
the
same
paradox
is
equally
true
of
writing
then
owen
walked
away
to
the
window
looking
out
among
the
shrubs
into
which
aby
mollett
had
been
precipitated
as
though
he
could
collect
his
thoughts
there
and
in
a
moment
or
two
the
earl
followed
him
and
looked
out
also
among
the
shrubs
they
killed
a
fox
exactly
there
the
other
day
did
they
asked
the
earl
indicating
the
spot
by
a
nod
of
his
head
yes
they
did
and
then
there
was
another
pause
i
tell
you
what
it
is
desmond
owen
said
at
last
going
back
to
the
rug
and
speaking
with
an
effort
as
the
people
say
sight
of
you
is
good
for
sore
eyes
there
is
a
positive
joy
to
me
in
seeing
you
it
is
like
a
cup
of
cold
water
when
a
man
is
thirsty
but
i
can
not
put
the
drink
to
my
lips
till
i
know
on
what
terms
we
are
to
meet
when
last
we
saw
each
other
we
were
speaking
of
your
sister
and
now
that
we
meet
again
we
must
again
speak
of
her
desmond
all
my
thoughts
are
of
her
i
dream
of
her
at
night
and
find
myself
talking
to
her
spirit
when
i
wake
in
the
morning
i
have
much
else
that
i
ought
to
think
of
but
i
go
about
thinking
of
nothing
but
of
her
i
am
told
that
she
is
engaged
to
my
cousin
herbert
nay
she
has
told
me
so
herself
and
i
know
that
it
is
so
but
if
she
becomes
his
wife
any
man
wife
but
mine
i
can
not
live
in
this
country
he
had
not
said
one
word
of
that
state
of
things
in
his
history
of
which
the
country
side
was
so
full
he
had
spoken
of
herbert
but
he
had
not
alluded
to
herbert
fall
he
had
spoken
of
such
hope
as
he
still
might
have
with
reference
to
clara
desmond
but
he
did
not
make
the
slightest
reference
to
that
change
in
his
fortunes
in
his
fortunes
and
in
those
of
his
rival
which
might
have
so
strong
a
bias
on
those
hopes
and
which
ought
so
to
have
in
the
minds
of
all
worldly
prudent
people
it
was
to
speak
of
this
specially
that
lord
desmond
had
come
thither
and
then
if
opportunity
should
offer
to
lead
away
the
subject
to
that
other
one
but
now
owen
had
begun
at
the
wrong
end
if
called
upon
to
speak
about
his
sister
at
once
what
could
the
brother
say
except
that
she
was
engaged
to
herbert
fitzgerald
tell
me
this
desmond
whom
does
your
sister
love
said
owen
speaking
almost
fiercely
in
his
earnestness
i
know
so
much
of
you
at
any
rate
that
whatever
may
be
your
feelings
you
will
not
lie
to
me
thereby
communicating
to
the
young
lord
an
accusation
which
he
very
well
understood
against
the
truth
of
the
countess
his
mother
when
i
have
spoken
to
her
about
this
she
declares
that
she
is
engaged
to
herbert
fitzgerald
engaged
to
him
yes
i
know
that
i
do
not
doubt
that
it
has
been
dinned
into
my
ears
now
for
the
last
six
months
till
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
it
and
she
will
marry
him
too
if
no
one
interferes
to
prevent
it
i
do
not
doubt
that
either
but
desmond
that
is
not
the
question
that
i
have
asked
she
did
love
me
and
then
she
was
ordered
by
her
mother
to
abandon
that
love
and
to
give
her
heart
to
another
that
in
words
she
has
been
obedient
i
know
well
but
what
i
doubt
is
this
that
she
has
in
truth
been
able
so
to
chuck
her
heart
about
like
a
shuttlecock
i
can
only
say
that
i
am
not
able
to
do
it
how
was
the
earl
to
answer
him
the
very
line
of
argument
which
owen
mind
was
taking
was
exactly
that
which
the
young
lord
himself
desired
to
promote
he
too
was
desirous
that
clara
should
go
back
to
her
first
love
he
himself
thought
strongly
that
owen
was
a
man
more
fitted
than
herbert
for
the
worshipful
adoration
of
such
a
girl
as
his
sister
clara
but
then
he
desmond
had
opposed
the
match
while
owen
was
poor
and
how
was
he
to
frame
words
by
which
he
might
encourage
it
now
that
owen
was
rich
i
have
been
so
little
with
her
that
i
hardly
know
he
said
but
owen
well
it
is
so
difficult
for
me
to
talk
to
you
about
all
this
is
it
why
yes
you
know
that
i
have
always
liked
you
always
no
chap
was
ever
such
a
friend
to
me
as
you
have
been
and
he
squeezed
arm
with
strong
boyish
love
i
know
all
about
it
said
owen
well
then
all
that
happened
about
clara
i
was
young
then
you
know
he
was
now
sixteen
and
had
not
thought
anything
about
it
the
idea
of
you
and
clara
falling
in
love
had
never
occurred
to
me
boys
are
so
blind
you
know
but
when
it
did
happen
you
remember
that
day
old
fellow
when
you
and
i
met
down
at
the
gate
remember
it
said
owen
he
would
remember
it
as
he
thought
when
half
an
eternity
should
have
passed
over
his
head
and
i
told
you
then
what
i
thought
i
do
think
i
am
a
particular
fellow
myself
about
money
and
rank
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
am
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
and
so
i
shall
always
remain
and
for
myself
i
do
care
about
it
but
for
one
sister
owen
you
never
had
a
sister
had
you
never
said
owen
hardly
thinking
of
the
question
one
is
obliged
to
think
of
such
things
for
her
we
should
all
go
to
rack
and
ruin
the
whole
family
of
us
box
and
dice
as
indeed
we
have
pretty
well
already
if
some
of
us
did
not
begin
to
look
about
us
i
do
suppose
i
shall
ever
marry
and
have
a
family
i
afford
it
you
know
and
in
that
case
clara
son
would
be
earl
of
desmond
or
if
i
died
she
would
be
countess
of
desmond
in
her
own
right
and
the
young
lord
looked
the
personification
of
family
prudence
i
know
all
that
said
owen
but
you
do
not
suppose
that
i
was
thinking
of
it
what
as
regards
yourself
no
i
am
sure
you
never
did
but
looking
to
all
that
it
would
never
have
done
for
her
to
marry
a
man
as
poor
as
you
were
it
is
not
a
comfortable
thing
to
be
a
very
poor
nobleman
i
can
tell
you
owen
again
remained
silent
he
wanted
to
talk
the
earl
over
into
favouring
his
views
but
he
wanted
to
do
so
as
owen
of
hap
house
not
as
owen
of
castle
richmond
he
perceived
at
once
from
the
tone
of
the
boy
voice
and
even
from
his
words
that
there
was
no
longer
anything
to
be
feared
from
the
brother
opposition
and
perceiving
this
he
thought
that
the
mother
opposition
might
now
perhaps
also
be
removed
but
it
was
quite
manifest
that
this
had
come
from
what
was
supposed
to
be
his
altered
position
a
man
as
poor
as
you
were
lord
desmond
had
said
urging
that
though
now
the
marriage
might
be
well
enough
in
those
former
days
it
would
have
been
madness
the
line
of
argument
was
very
clear
but
as
owen
was
as
poor
as
ever
and
intended
to
remain
so
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
comfort
him
i
can
not
say
that
i
myself
have
so
much
worldly
wisdom
as
you
have
said
he
at
last
with
something
like
a
sneer
ah
that
is
just
what
i
knew
you
would
say
you
think
that
i
am
coming
to
you
now
and
offering
to
make
up
matters
between
you
and
clara
because
you
are
rich
but
can
you
make
up
matters
between
me
and
clara
said
owen
eagerly
well
i
do
not
know
the
countess
seems
to
think
it
might
be
so
and
then
again
owen
was
silent
walking
about
the
room
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
then
after
all
the
one
thing
of
this
world
which
his
eye
regarded
as
desirable
was
within
his
reach
he
had
then
been
right
in
supposing
that
that
face
which
had
once
looked
up
to
his
so
full
of
love
had
been
a
true
reflex
of
the
girl
heart
that
it
had
indicated
to
him
love
which
was
not
changeable
it
was
true
that
clara
having
accepted
a
suitor
at
her
mother
order
might
now
be
allowed
to
come
back
to
him
as
he
thought
of
this
he
wondered
at
the
endurance
and
obedience
of
a
woman
heart
which
could
thus
give
up
all
that
it
held
as
sacred
at
the
instance
of
another
but
even
this
though
it
was
but
little
flattering
to
clara
by
no
means
lessened
the
transport
which
he
felt
he
had
had
that
pride
in
himself
that
he
had
never
ceased
to
believe
that
she
loved
him
full
of
that
thought
of
which
he
had
not
dared
to
speak
he
had
gone
about
gloomily
miserable
since
the
news
of
her
engagement
with
herbert
had
reached
him
and
now
he
learned
as
he
thought
with
certainty
that
his
belief
had
been
well
grounded
through
all
that
had
passed
clara
desmond
did
love
him
still
but
as
to
this
overture
of
reconciliation
that
was
now
made
to
him
how
was
he
to
accept
it
or
reject
it
it
was
made
to
him
because
he
was
believed
to
be
sir
owen
fitzgerald
of
castle
richmond
a
baronet
of
twelve
thousand
a
year
instead
of
a
poor
squire
whose
wife
would
have
to
look
narrowly
to
the
kitchen
in
order
that
food
in
sufficiency
might
be
forthcoming
for
the
parlour
that
he
would
become
sir
owen
he
thought
probable
but
that
he
would
be
sir
owen
of
hap
house
and
not
of
castle
richmond
he
had
firmly
resolved
he
had
thought
of
this
for
long
hours
and
hours
together
and
felt
that
he
could
never
again
be
happy
were
he
to
put
his
foot
into
that
house
as
its
owner
every
tenant
would
scorn
him
every
servant
would
hate
him
every
neighbour
would
condemn
him
but
this
would
be
as
nothing
to
his
hatred
of
himself
to
his
own
scorn
and
his
own
condemnation
and
yet
how
great
was
the
temptation
to
him
now
if
he
would
consent
to
call
himself
master
of
castle
richmond
clara
hand
might
still
be
his
so
he
thought
but
those
who
know
clara
desmond
better
than
he
did
will
know
how
false
were
his
hopes
she
was
hardly
the
girl
to
have
gone
back
to
a
lover
when
he
was
rich
whom
she
had
rejected
when
he
was
poor
desmond
said
he
come
here
and
sit
down
and
both
sat
leaning
on
the
table
together
with
their
arms
touching
i
understand
it
all
now
i
think
and
remember
this
my
boy
that
whomever
i
may
blame
i
do
not
blame
you
that
you
are
true
and
honest
i
am
sure
and
indeed
there
is
only
one
person
whom
i
do
blame
he
did
not
say
that
this
one
person
was
the
countess
but
the
earl
knew
just
as
well
as
though
he
had
been
told
i
understand
all
this
now
he
repeated
and
before
we
go
any
further
i
must
tell
you
one
thing
i
shall
never
be
owner
of
castle
richmond
why
i
thought
it
was
all
settled
said
the
earl
looking
up
with
surprise
nothing
at
all
is
settled
to
every
bargain
there
must
be
two
parties
and
i
have
never
yet
become
a
party
to
the
bargain
which
shall
make
me
owner
of
castle
richmond
but
is
it
not
yours
of
right
i
do
not
know
what
you
call
right
right
of
inheritance
said
the
earl
who
having
succeeded
to
his
own
rank
by
the
strength
of
the
same
right
enduring
through
many
ages
looked
upon
it
as
the
one
substantial
palladium
of
the
country
look
here
old
fellow
and
i
tell
you
my
views
about
this
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
when
he
married
that
poor
lady
who
is
still
staying
at
castle
richmond
did
so
in
the
face
of
the
world
with
the
full
assurance
that
he
made
her
his
legal
wife
whether
such
a
case
as
this
ever
occurred
before
i
do
know
but
i
am
sure
of
this
that
in
the
eye
of
god
she
is
his
widow
herbert
fitzgerald
was
brought
up
as
the
heir
to
all
that
estate
and
i
can
not
see
that
he
can
fairly
be
robbed
of
that
right
because
another
man
has
been
a
villain
the
title
he
can
not
have
i
suppose
because
the
law
wo
give
it
him
but
the
property
can
be
made
over
to
him
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
shall
be
made
over
no
earthly
consideration
shall
induce
me
to
put
my
hand
upon
it
for
in
doing
so
i
should
look
upon
myself
as
a
thief
and
a
scoundrel
and
you
mean
then
that
herbert
will
have
it
all
just
the
same
as
it
was
before
just
the
same
as
regards
the
estate
then
why
has
he
gone
away
i
can
not
answer
for
him
i
can
only
tell
you
what
i
shall
do
i
dare
say
it
may
take
months
before
it
is
all
settled
but
now
desmond
you
know
how
i
stand
i
am
owen
fitzgerald
of
hap
house
now
as
i
have
ever
been
that
and
nothing
more
for
as
to
the
handle
to
my
name
it
is
not
worth
talking
about
they
were
still
sitting
at
the
table
and
now
they
both
sat
silent
not
looking
at
each
other
but
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
wood
owen
had
in
his
hand
a
pen
which
he
had
taken
from
the
mantelpiece
and
unconsciously
began
to
trace
signs
on
the
polished
surface
before
him
the
earl
sat
with
his
forehead
leaning
on
his
two
hands
thinking
what
he
was
to
say
next
he
felt
that
he
himself
loved
the
man
better
than
ever
but
when
his
mother
should
come
to
hear
all
this
what
would
she
say
you
know
it
all
now
my
boy
said
owen
looking
up
at
last
and
as
he
did
so
there
was
an
expression
about
his
face
to
which
the
young
earl
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
the
like
there
was
a
gleam
in
his
eye
which
though
not
of
joy
was
so
bright
and
a
smile
round
his
mouth
which
was
so
sweet
though
full
of
sadness
how
can
she
not
love
him
said
he
to
himself
thinking
of
his
sister
and
now
desmond
go
back
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
all
she
has
sent
you
here
no
she
did
not
send
me
said
the
boy
stoutly
almost
angrily
she
does
not
even
know
that
i
have
come
go
back
then
to
your
sister
nor
does
she
know
it
nevertheless
go
back
to
them
and
tell
them
both
what
i
have
told
you
and
tell
them
this
also
that
i
owen
fitzgerald
of
hap
house
still
love
her
better
than
all
that
the
world
else
can
give
me
indeed
there
is
nothing
else
that
i
do
love
except
you
desmond
but
tell
them
also
that
i
am
owen
of
hap
house
still
that
and
nothing
more
owen
said
the
lad
looking
up
at
him
and
fitzgerald
as
he
glanced
into
the
boy
face
could
see
that
there
was
that
arising
within
his
breast
which
almost
prevented
him
from
speaking
and
look
desmond
continued
fitzgerald
do
not
think
that
i
shall
blame
you
because
you
turn
from
me
or
call
you
mercenary
do
you
do
what
you
think
right
what
you
said
just
now
of
your
sister
well
of
the
possibility
of
our
marriage
you
said
under
the
idea
that
i
was
a
rich
man
you
now
find
that
i
am
a
poor
man
and
you
may
consider
that
the
words
were
never
spoken
owen
said
the
boy
again
and
now
that
which
was
before
rising
in
his
breast
had
risen
to
his
brow
and
cheeks
and
was
telling
its
tale
plainly
in
his
eyes
and
then
he
rose
from
his
chair
turning
away
his
face
and
walking
towards
the
window
but
before
he
had
gone
two
steps
he
turned
again
and
throwing
himself
on
fitzgerald
breast
he
burst
out
into
a
passion
of
tears
come
old
fellow
what
is
this
this
will
never
do
said
owen
but
his
own
eyes
were
full
of
tears
also
and
he
too
was
nearly
past
speaking
i
know
you
will
think
i
am
a
boy
and
a
fool
said
the
earl
through
his
sobs
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
but
i
ca
help
it
i
think
you
are
the
dearest
finest
best
fellow
that
ever
lived
said
fitzgerald
pressing
him
with
his
arm
and
i
tell
you
what
owen
you
should
have
her
if
it
were
in
my
power
for
by
heaven
there
is
not
another
man
so
worthy
of
a
girl
in
all
the
world
and
i
tell
her
so
and
i
do
care
what
the
countess
says
and
owen
come
what
come
may
you
shall
always
have
my
word
and
then
he
stood
apart
and
rubbing
his
eyes
with
his
arm
tried
to
look
like
a
man
who
was
giving
this
pledge
from
his
judgment
not
from
his
impulse
it
all
depends
on
this
desmond
whom
does
she
love
see
her
alone
desmond
and
talk
softly
to
her
and
find
out
that
this
he
said
thoughtfully
for
in
his
mind
love
should
still
be
lord
of
all
by
heavens
if
i
were
her
i
know
whom
i
should
love
said
the
brother
i
would
not
have
her
as
a
gift
if
she
did
not
love
me
said
owen
proudly
but
if
she
do
i
have
a
right
to
claim
her
as
my
own
and
then
they
parted
and
the
earl
rode
back
home
with
a
quieter
pace
than
that
which
had
brought
him
there
and
in
a
different
mood
he
had
pledged
himself
now
to
owen
not
to
owen
of
castle
richmond
but
to
owen
of
hap
house
and
he
intended
to
redeem
his
pledge
if
it
were
possible
he
had
been
so
conquered
by
the
nobleness
of
his
friend
that
he
had
forgotten
his
solicitude
for
his
family
and
his
sister
chapter
xxxvii
a
tale
of
a
turbot
it
would
have
been
owen
fitzgerald
desire
to
disclaim
the
inheritance
which
chance
had
put
in
his
way
in
absolute
silence
had
such
a
course
been
possible
to
him
and
indeed
not
being
very
well
conversant
with
matters
of
business
he
had
thought
for
a
while
that
this
might
be
done
or
at
any
rate
something
not
far
different
from
this
to
those
who
had
hitherto
spoken
to
him
upon
the
subject
to
prendergast
somers
and
his
cousin
he
had
disclaimed
the
inheritance
and
that
he
had
thought
would
have
sufficed
that
sir
thomas
should
die
so
quickly
after
the
discovery
had
not
of
course
been
expected
by
anybody
and
much
therefore
had
not
been
thought
at
the
moment
of
these
disclaimers
neither
at
the
moment
nor
indeed
afterwards
when
sir
thomas
did
die
even
somers
was
prepared
to
admit
that
as
the
game
had
been
given
up
as
his
branch
of
the
fitzgeralds
acting
under
the
advice
of
their
friend
and
lawyer
admitted
that
the
property
must
go
from
them
even
he
much
as
he
contested
within
his
own
breast
the
propriety
of
prendergast
decisions
was
fain
to
admit
now
that
it
was
owen
business
to
walk
in
upon
the
property
any
words
which
he
may
have
spoken
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
were
empty
words
when
a
man
becomes
heir
to
twelve
thousand
a
year
he
does
not
give
it
up
in
a
freak
of
benevolence
and
therefore
when
sir
thomas
had
been
dead
some
four
or
five
weeks
and
when
herbert
had
gone
away
from
the
scene
which
was
no
longer
one
of
interest
to
him
it
was
necessary
that
something
should
be
done
during
the
last
two
or
three
days
of
his
life
sir
thomas
had
executed
a
new
will
in
which
he
admitted
that
his
son
was
not
the
heir
to
his
estates
and
so
disposed
of
such
moneys
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
leave
as
he
would
have
done
had
herbert
been
a
younger
son
early
in
his
life
he
himself
had
added
something
to
the
property
some
two
or
three
hundred
a
year
and
this
also
he
left
of
course
to
his
own
family
such
having
been
done
there
would
have
been
no
opposition
made
to
owen
had
he
immediately
claimed
the
inheritance
but
as
he
made
no
claim
and
took
no
step
whatever
as
he
appeared
neither
by
himself
nor
by
letter
nor
by
lawyer
nor
by
agent
as
no
rumour
ever
got
about
as
to
what
he
intended
to
do
somers
found
it
necessary
to
write
to
him
this
he
did
on
the
day
of
departure
merely
asking
him
perhaps
with
scant
courtesy
who
was
his
man
of
business
in
order
that
he
somers
as
agent
to
the
late
proprietor
might
confer
with
him
with
but
scant
courtesy
for
somers
had
made
one
visit
to
hap
house
since
the
news
had
been
known
with
some
intention
of
ingratiating
himself
with
the
future
heir
but
his
tenders
had
not
been
graciously
received
somers
was
a
proud
man
and
though
his
position
in
life
depended
on
the
income
he
received
from
the
castle
richmond
estate
he
would
not
make
any
further
overture
so
his
letter
was
somewhat
of
the
shortest
and
merely
contained
the
request
above
named
owen
reply
was
sharp
immediate
and
equally
short
and
was
carried
back
by
the
messenger
from
castle
richmond
who
had
brought
the
letter
to
which
it
was
an
answer
it
was
as
follows
hap
house
thursday
morning
two
there
was
no
other
date
and
owen
probably
was
unaware
that
his
letter
being
written
at
two
was
not
written
on
thursday
morning
dear
sir
i
have
got
no
lawyer
and
no
man
of
business
nor
do
i
mean
to
employ
any
if
i
can
help
it
i
intend
to
make
no
claim
to
herbert
fitzgerald
property
of
castle
richmond
and
if
it
be
necessary
that
i
should
sign
any
legal
document
making
over
to
him
any
claim
that
i
may
have
i
am
prepared
to
do
so
at
any
moment
as
he
has
got
a
lawyer
he
can
get
this
arranged
and
i
suppose
prendergast
had
better
do
it
i
am
dear
sir
your
faithful
servant
owen
fitzgerald
of
hap
house
and
with
those
four
or
five
lines
he
thought
it
would
be
practicable
for
him
to
close
the
whole
affair
this
happened
on
the
day
of
herbert
departure
and
on
the
day
preceding
lord
desmond
visit
to
hap
house
so
that
on
the
occasion
of
that
visit
owen
looked
upon
the
deed
as
fully
done
he
had
put
it
quite
beyond
his
own
power
to
recede
now
even
had
he
so
wished
and
then
came
the
tidings
to
him
true
tidings
as
he
thought
that
clara
was
still
within
his
reach
if
only
he
were
master
of
castle
richmond
that
this
view
of
his
position
did
for
a
moment
shake
him
i
will
not
deny
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
and
then
it
was
that
he
had
looked
up
at
clara
brother
and
bade
him
go
back
to
his
mother
and
sister
and
tell
them
that
owen
of
hap
house
was
owen
of
hap
house
still
that
and
nothing
more
clara
desmond
might
be
bought
at
a
price
which
would
be
too
costly
even
for
such
a
prize
as
her
it
was
well
for
him
that
he
so
resolved
for
at
no
price
could
she
have
been
bought
somers
when
he
received
that
letter
was
much
inclined
to
doubt
whether
or
no
it
might
not
be
well
to
take
owen
at
his
word
after
all
what
just
right
had
he
to
the
estate
according
to
the
eternal
and
unalterable
laws
of
right
and
wrong
ought
it
not
to
belong
to
herbert
fitzgerald
somers
allowed
his
wish
on
this
occasion
to
be
father
to
many
thoughts
much
at
variance
from
that
line
of
thinking
which
was
customary
to
him
as
a
man
of
business
in
his
ordinary
moods
law
with
him
was
law
and
a
legal
claim
a
legal
claim
had
he
been
all
his
life
agent
to
the
hap
house
property
instead
of
to
that
of
castle
richmond
a
thought
so
romantic
would
never
have
entered
his
head
he
would
have
scouted
a
man
as
nearly
a
maniac
who
should
suggest
to
him
that
his
client
ought
to
surrender
an
undoubted
inheritance
of
twelve
thousand
a
year
on
a
point
of
feeling
he
would
have
rejected
it
as
a
proposed
crime
and
talked
much
of
the
indefeasible
rights
of
the
coming
heirs
of
the
new
heir
he
would
have
been
as
firm
as
a
rock
and
as
trenchant
as
a
sword
in
defence
of
his
patron
claims
but
now
having
in
his
hands
that
short
pithy
letter
from
owen
fitzgerald
he
could
not
but
look
at
the
matter
in
a
more
christian
light
after
all
was
not
justice
immutable
justice
better
than
law
and
would
not
the
property
be
enough
for
both
of
them
might
not
law
and
justice
make
a
compromise
let
owen
be
the
baronet
and
take
a
slice
of
four
or
five
thousand
and
add
that
to
hap
house
and
then
if
these
things
were
well
arranged
might
not
somers
still
be
agent
to
them
both
meditating
all
this
in
his
newly
tuned
romantic
frame
of
mind
somers
sat
down
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
prendergast
enclosing
the
short
letter
from
owen
and
saying
all
that
he
as
a
man
of
business
with
a
new
dash
of
romance
could
say
on
such
a
subject
this
letter
not
having
slept
on
the
road
as
herbert
did
in
dublin
and
having
been
conveyed
with
that
lightning
rapidity
for
which
the
british
has
ever
been
remarkable
and
especially
that
portion
of
it
which
has
reference
to
the
sister
island
was
in
prendergast
pocket
when
herbert
dined
with
him
that
letter
and
another
to
which
we
shall
have
to
refer
more
specially
but
so
much
at
variance
were
prendergast
ideas
from
those
entertained
by
somers
that
he
would
not
even
speak
to
herbert
on
the
subject
perhaps
also
that
other
more
important
letter
which
if
we
live
we
shall
read
at
length
might
also
have
had
some
effect
in
keeping
him
silent
but
in
truth
somers
mind
and
that
of
prendergast
did
not
work
in
harmony
on
this
subject
judging
of
the
two
men
together
by
their
usual
deeds
and
ascertained
character
we
may
say
that
there
was
much
more
romance
about
prendergast
than
there
was
about
somers
but
then
it
was
a
general
romance
and
not
one
with
an
individual
object
or
perhaps
we
may
say
without
injury
to
somers
that
it
was
a
true
feeling
and
not
a
false
one
prendergast
also
was
much
more
anxious
for
the
welfare
of
herbert
fitzgerald
than
that
of
his
cousin
but
then
he
could
feel
on
behalf
of
the
man
for
whom
he
was
interested
that
it
did
not
behove
him
to
take
a
present
of
an
estate
from
the
hands
of
the
true
owner
for
more
than
a
week
somers
waited
but
got
no
reply
to
his
letter
and
heard
nothing
from
prendergast
and
during
this
time
he
was
really
puzzled
as
to
what
he
should
do
as
regarded
himself
he
did
not
know
at
what
moment
his
income
might
end
or
how
long
he
and
his
family
might
be
allowed
to
inhabit
the
house
which
he
now
held
and
then
he
could
take
no
steps
as
to
the
tenants
could
neither
receive
money
nor
pay
it
away
and
was
altogether
at
his
wits
ends
lady
fitzgerald
looked
to
him
for
counsel
in
everything
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
counsel
her
arrangements
were
to
be
made
for
an
auction
in
the
house
as
soon
as
she
should
be
able
to
move
but
would
it
not
be
a
thousand
pities
to
sell
all
the
furniture
if
there
was
a
prospect
of
the
family
returning
and
so
he
waited
for
prendergast
letter
with
an
uneasy
heart
and
vexation
of
spirit
but
still
he
attended
the
relief
committees
and
worked
at
the
attached
to
the
estate
as
though
he
were
still
the
agent
to
castle
richmond
and
still
debated
warmly
with
father
barney
on
one
side
and
townsend
on
the
other
on
that
vexatious
question
of
relief
and
now
the
famine
was
in
full
swing
and
strange
to
say
men
had
ceased
to
be
uncomfortable
about
it
such
men
that
is
as
somers
and
townsend
the
cutting
off
of
maimed
limbs
and
wrenching
out
from
their
sockets
of
smashed
bones
is
by
no
means
shocking
to
the
skilled
practitioner
and
dying
paupers
with
the
drag
in
their
face
that
certain
sign
of
coming
death
of
which
i
have
spoken
no
longer
struck
men
to
the
heart
like
the
skilled
surgeon
they
worked
hard
enough
at
what
good
they
could
do
and
worked
the
better
in
that
they
could
treat
the
cases
without
express
compassion
for
the
individuals
that
met
their
eyes
in
administering
relief
one
may
rob
five
unseen
sufferers
of
what
would
keep
them
in
life
if
one
is
moved
to
bestow
all
that
is
comfortable
on
one
sufferer
that
is
seen
was
it
wise
to
spend
money
in
alleviating
the
last
hours
of
those
whose
doom
was
already
spoken
which
money
if
duly
used
might
save
the
lives
of
others
not
yet
so
far
gone
in
misery
and
so
in
one
sense
those
who
were
the
best
in
the
county
who
worked
the
hardest
for
the
poor
and
spent
their
time
most
completely
among
them
became
the
hardest
of
heart
and
most
obdurate
in
their
denials
it
was
strange
to
see
devoted
women
neglecting
the
wants
of
the
dying
so
that
they
might
husband
their
strength
and
time
and
means
for
the
wants
of
those
who
might
still
be
kept
among
the
living
at
this
time
there
came
over
to
the
parish
of
drumbarrow
a
young
english
clergyman
who
might
be
said
to
be
in
many
respects
the
very
opposite
to
townsend
two
men
could
hardly
be
found
in
the
same
profession
more
opposite
in
their
ideas
lives
purposes
and
pursuits
with
this
similarity
however
that
each
was
a
sincere
and
on
the
whole
an
honest
man
the
rev
carter
was
much
the
junior
being
at
that
time
under
thirty
he
had
now
visited
ireland
with
the
sole
object
of
working
among
the
poor
and
distributing
according
to
his
own
judgment
certain
funds
which
had
been
collected
for
this
purpose
in
england
and
indeed
there
did
often
exist
in
england
at
this
time
a
misapprehension
as
to
irish
wants
which
led
to
some
misuses
of
the
funds
which
england
so
liberally
sent
it
came
at
that
time
to
be
the
duty
of
a
certain
public
officer
to
inquire
into
a
charge
made
against
a
seemingly
respectable
man
in
the
far
west
of
ireland
purporting
that
he
had
appropriated
to
his
own
use
a
sum
of
twelve
pounds
sent
to
him
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
of
his
parish
it
had
been
sent
by
three
english
maiden
ladies
to
the
relieving
officer
of
the
parish
of
kilcoutymorrow
and
had
come
to
his
hands
he
then
filling
that
position
he
so
the
charge
said
and
unfortunately
said
so
with
only
too
much
truth
had
put
the
twelve
pounds
into
his
own
private
pocket
the
officer
duty
in
the
matter
took
him
to
the
chairman
of
the
relief
committee
a
stanch
old
roman
catholic
gentleman
nearly
eighty
years
of
age
with
a
hoary
head
and
white
beard
and
a
milesian
name
that
had
come
down
to
him
through
centuries
of
catholic
ancestors
a
man
urbane
in
his
manner
of
the
old
school
an
irishman
such
as
one
does
meet
still
here
and
there
through
the
country
but
now
not
often
one
who
above
all
things
was
true
to
the
old
religion
then
the
officer
of
the
government
told
his
story
to
the
old
irish
gentleman
with
many
words
for
there
were
all
manner
of
small
collateral
proofs
to
all
of
which
the
old
irish
gentleman
listened
with
a
courtesy
and
patience
which
were
admirable
and
when
the
officer
of
the
government
had
done
the
old
irish
gentleman
thus
replied
my
neighbour
hobbs
such
was
the
culprit
name
has
undoubtedly
done
this
thing
he
has
certainly
spent
upon
his
own
uses
the
generous
offering
made
to
our
poor
parish
by
those
ladies
the
three
miss
walkers
but
he
has
acted
with
perfect
honesty
in
the
matter
what
said
the
government
officer
robbing
the
poor
and
at
such
a
time
as
this
no
robbery
at
all
dear
sir
said
the
good
old
irish
gentleman
with
the
blandest
of
all
possible
smiles
the
excellent
miss
walkers
sent
their
money
for
the
protestant
poor
of
the
parish
of
kilcoutymorrow
and
hobbs
is
the
only
protestant
within
it
and
from
the
twinkle
in
the
old
man
eye
it
was
clear
to
see
that
his
triumph
consisted
in
this
that
not
only
he
had
but
one
protestant
in
the
parish
but
that
that
protestant
should
have
learned
so
little
from
his
religion
but
this
is
an
episode
and
nowadays
no
episodes
are
allowed
and
now
carter
had
come
over
to
see
that
if
possible
certain
english
funds
were
distributed
according
to
the
wishes
of
the
generous
english
hearts
by
whom
they
had
been
sent
for
as
some
english
such
as
the
three
miss
walkers
feared
on
the
one
hand
that
the
babylonish
woman
so
rampant
in
ireland
might
swallow
up
their
money
for
babylonish
purposes
so
on
the
other
hand
did
others
dread
that
the
too
stanch
protestantism
of
the
church
militant
in
that
country
might
expend
the
funds
collected
for
undoubted
bodily
wants
in
administering
to
the
supposed
wants
of
the
soul
no
such
faults
did
in
truth
at
that
time
prevail
the
indomitable
force
of
the
famine
had
absolutely
knocked
down
all
that
but
there
had
been
things
done
in
ireland
before
the
famine
came
upon
them
which
gave
reasonable
suspicion
for
such
fears
townsend
among
others
had
been
very
active
in
soliciting
aid
from
england
and
hence
had
arisen
a
correspondence
between
him
and
carter
and
now
carter
had
arrived
at
drumbarrow
with
a
respectable
sum
to
his
credit
at
the
provincial
bank
and
an
intense
desire
to
make
himself
useful
in
this
time
of
sore
need
carter
was
a
tall
thin
man
one
seemingly
who
had
macerated
himself
inwardly
and
outwardly
by
hard
living
he
had
a
high
narrow
forehead
a
sparse
amount
of
animal
development
thin
lips
and
a
piercing
sharp
gray
eye
he
was
a
man
too
of
few
words
and
would
have
been
altogether
harsh
in
his
appearance
had
there
not
been
that
in
the
twinkle
of
his
eye
which
seemed
to
say
that
in
spite
of
all
that
his
gait
said
to
the
contrary
the
cockles
of
his
heart
might
yet
be
reached
by
some
play
of
wit
if
only
the
wit
were
to
his
taste
carter
was
a
man
of
personal
means
so
that
he
not
only
was
not
dependent
on
his
profession
but
was
able
as
he
also
was
willing
to
aid
that
profession
by
his
liberality
in
one
thing
only
was
he
personally
expensive
as
to
his
eating
and
drinking
it
was
or
might
have
been
for
any
solicitude
of
his
own
little
more
than
bread
and
water
as
for
the
comforts
of
home
he
had
none
for
since
his
ordination
his
missions
had
ever
been
migrating
but
he
always
dressed
with
care
and
consequently
with
expense
for
careful
dressing
is
ever
expensive
he
always
wore
new
black
gloves
and
a
very
long
black
coat
which
never
degenerated
to
rust
black
cloth
trousers
a
high
black
silk
waistcoat
and
a
new
black
hat
everything
about
him
was
black
except
his
neck
and
that
was
always
scrupulously
white
carter
was
a
good
man
one
may
say
a
very
good
man
for
he
gave
up
himself
and
his
money
to
carry
out
high
views
of
charity
and
religion
in
which
he
was
sincere
with
the
sincerity
of
his
whole
heart
and
from
which
he
looked
for
no
reward
save
such
as
the
godly
ever
seek
but
yet
there
was
about
him
too
much
of
the
pharisee
he
was
greatly
inclined
to
condemn
other
men
and
to
think
none
righteous
who
differed
from
him
and
now
he
had
come
to
ireland
with
a
certain
conviction
that
the
clergy
of
his
own
church
there
were
men
not
to
be
trusted
that
they
were
mere
irish
and
little
better
in
their
habits
and
doctrines
than
dissenters
he
had
been
elsewhere
in
the
country
before
he
visited
drumbarrow
and
had
shown
this
too
plainly
but
then
carter
was
a
very
young
man
and
it
is
not
perhaps
fair
to
expect
zeal
and
discretion
also
from
those
who
are
very
young
townsend
had
heard
of
him
and
was
in
dismay
when
she
found
that
he
was
to
stay
with
them
at
drumbarrow
parsonage
for
three
days
if
carter
did
not
like
clerical
characters
of
her
stamp
neither
did
she
like
them
of
the
stamp
of
carter
she
had
heard
of
him
of
his
austerity
of
his
look
of
his
habits
and
in
her
heart
she
believed
him
to
be
a
jesuit
had
she
possessed
full
sway
herself
in
the
parish
of
drumbarrow
no
bodies
should
have
been
saved
at
such
terrible
peril
to
the
souls
of
the
whole
parish
but
this
carter
came
with
such
recommendation
with
such
assurances
of
money
given
and
to
be
given
of
service
done
and
to
be
done
that
there
was
no
refusing
him
and
so
the
husband
more
worldly
wise
than
his
wife
had
invited
the
jesuit
to
his
parsonage
you
find
√¶neas
he
have
mass
in
his
room
in
the
morning
instead
of
coming
to
family
prayers
said
the
wife
but
what
on
earth
shall
we
give
him
for
dinner
said
the
husband
whose
soul
at
the
present
moment
was
among
the
and
indeed
townsend
had
also
turned
over
that
question
in
her
prudent
mind
he
not
eat
meat
in
lent
you
may
be
sure
said
townsend
remembering
that
that
was
the
present
period
of
the
year
and
if
he
would
there
is
none
for
him
to
eat
said
townsend
calling
to
mind
the
way
in
which
the
larder
had
of
late
been
emptied
protestant
clergymen
in
ireland
in
those
days
had
very
frequently
other
reasons
for
fasting
than
those
prescribed
by
ecclesiastical
canons
a
lady
the
wife
of
a
parish
rector
in
the
county
cork
showed
me
her
larder
one
day
about
that
time
it
contained
two
large
loaves
of
bread
and
a
pan
full
of
stuff
which
i
should
have
called
paste
but
which
she
called
porridge
it
was
all
that
she
had
for
herself
her
husband
her
children
and
her
charity
her
servants
had
left
her
before
she
came
to
that
pass
and
she
was
a
handsome
educated
woman
born
to
such
comforts
as
you
and
i
enjoy
every
day
oh
my
reader
perhaps
without
much
giving
of
thanks
for
them
poor
lady
the
struggle
was
too
much
for
her
and
she
died
under
it
townsend
was
as
i
have
said
the
very
opposite
to
carter
but
he
also
was
a
man
who
could
do
without
the
comforts
of
life
if
the
comforts
of
life
did
not
come
readily
in
his
way
he
liked
his
glass
of
whisky
punch
dearly
and
had
an
idea
that
it
was
good
for
him
not
caring
much
about
personal
debts
he
would
go
in
debt
for
whisky
but
if
the
whisky
and
credit
were
at
an
end
the
loss
did
not
make
him
miserable
he
was
a
man
with
a
large
appetite
and
who
took
great
advantage
of
a
good
dinner
when
it
was
before
him
nay
he
would
go
a
long
distance
to
insure
a
good
dinner
but
nevertheless
he
would
leave
himself
without
the
means
of
getting
a
mutton
chop
and
then
not
be
unhappy
now
carter
would
have
been
very
unhappy
had
he
been
left
without
his
superfine
long
black
coat
in
tendering
his
invitation
to
carter
townsend
had
explained
that
with
him
the
angusta
which
was
always
a
prevailing
disease
had
been
heightened
by
the
circumstances
of
the
time
but
that
of
such
crust
and
cup
as
he
had
his
brother
english
clergyman
would
be
made
most
welcome
to
partake
in
answer
to
this
carter
had
explained
that
in
these
days
good
men
thought
but
little
of
crusts
and
cups
and
that
as
regarded
himself
nature
had
so
made
him
that
he
had
but
few
concupiscences
of
that
sort
and
then
all
this
having
been
so
far
explained
and
settled
carter
came
the
first
day
the
two
clergymen
spent
together
at
berryhill
and
found
plenty
to
employ
them
they
were
now
like
enough
to
be
in
want
of
funds
at
that
berryhill
seeing
that
the
great
fount
of
supplies
the
house
namely
of
castle
richmond
would
soon
have
stopped
running
altogether
and
carter
was
ready
to
provide
funds
to
some
moderate
extent
if
all
his
questions
were
answered
satisfactorily
there
was
to
be
no
making
of
protestants
he
said
by
giving
away
of
soup
purchased
with
his
money
townsend
thought
that
this
might
have
been
spared
him
i
regret
to
say
replied
he
with
some
touch
of
sarcasm
that
we
have
no
time
for
that
now
and
so
better
said
carter
with
a
sarcasm
of
a
blunter
sort
so
better
let
us
not
clog
our
alms
with
impossible
conditions
which
will
only
create
falsehood
any
conditions
are
out
of
the
question
when
one
has
to
feed
a
whole
parish
answered
townsend
and
then
carter
would
teach
them
how
to
boil
their
yellow
meal
on
which
subject
he
had
a
theory
totally
opposite
to
the
practice
of
the
woman
employed
at
the
av
we
war
to
hocus
it
that
yer
riverence
said
daly
turning
to
townsend
the
crathurs
could
ate
a
bit
of
it
it
would
bile
at
all
at
all
not
like
that
try
it
woman
said
carter
when
he
had
uttered
his
receipt
oracularly
for
the
third
time
an
i
wo
said
daly
whose
presence
there
was
pretty
nearly
a
labour
of
love
and
who
was
therefore
independent
it
be
a
sin
an
a
shame
to
spile
christian
vittels
in
them
times
an
i
wo
do
it
and
then
there
was
some
hard
work
that
day
and
though
townsend
kept
his
temper
with
his
visitor
seeing
that
he
had
much
to
get
and
nothing
to
give
he
did
not
on
this
occasion
learn
to
alter
his
general
opinion
of
his
brethren
of
the
english
high
church
and
then
when
they
got
home
very
hungry
after
their
toil
townsend
made
another
apology
for
the
poorness
of
his
table
i
am
almost
ashamed
said
he
to
ask
an
english
gentleman
to
sit
down
to
such
a
dinner
as
townsend
will
put
before
you
and
indeed
then
it
is
much
said
townsend
just
a
bit
of
fish
i
found
going
the
road
my
dear
madam
anything
will
suffice
said
carter
somewhat
pretentiously
and
anything
would
have
sufficed
had
they
put
before
him
a
mess
of
that
paste
of
which
i
have
spoken
he
would
have
ate
it
and
said
nothing
ate
enough
of
it
at
least
to
sustain
him
till
the
morrow
but
things
had
not
come
to
so
bad
a
pass
as
this
at
drumbarrow
parsonage
and
indeed
that
day
fortune
had
been
propitious
fortune
which
ever
favours
the
daring
townsend
knowing
that
she
had
really
nothing
in
the
house
had
sent
jerry
to
waylay
the
lent
fishmonger
who
twice
a
week
was
known
to
make
his
way
from
kanturk
to
mallow
with
a
donkey
and
panniers
and
jerry
had
returned
with
a
prize
and
now
they
sat
down
to
dinner
and
lo
and
behold
to
the
great
surprise
of
carter
and
perhaps
also
to
the
surprise
of
the
host
a
magnificent
turbot
smoked
upon
the
board
the
fins
no
doubt
had
been
cut
off
to
render
possible
the
insertion
of
the
animal
into
the
largest
of
the
drumbarrow
parsonage
an
injury
against
which
townsend
immediately
exclaimed
angrily
my
goodness
they
have
cut
off
the
fins
said
he
holding
up
both
hands
in
deep
dismay
according
to
his
philosophy
if
he
did
have
a
turbot
why
should
he
not
have
it
with
all
its
perfections
about
it
fins
and
all
my
dear
√¶neas
said
townsend
looking
at
him
with
that
agony
of
domestic
distress
which
all
wives
so
well
know
how
to
assume
carter
said
nothing
he
said
not
a
word
but
he
thought
much
this
then
was
their
pretended
poorness
of
living
with
all
their
mock
humility
these
false
irishmen
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
of
showing
off
before
the
english
stranger
and
of
putting
on
their
table
before
him
a
dish
which
an
english
dean
could
afford
only
on
gala
days
and
then
this
clergyman
who
was
so
loudly
anxious
for
the
poor
could
not
repress
the
sorrow
of
his
heart
because
the
rich
delicacy
was
somewhat
marred
in
the
cooking
it
was
too
bad
thought
carter
to
himself
too
bad
none
thank
you
said
he
drawing
himself
up
with
gloomy
reprobation
of
countenance
i
will
not
take
any
fish
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
then
the
face
of
townsend
was
one
on
which
neither
christian
nor
heathen
could
have
looked
without
horror
and
grief
what
the
man
whom
in
her
heart
she
believed
to
be
a
jesuit
and
for
whom
nevertheless
jesuit
though
he
was
she
had
condescended
to
cater
with
all
her
woman
wit
this
man
i
say
would
not
eat
fish
in
lent
and
it
was
horrible
to
her
warm
irish
heart
to
think
that
after
that
fish
now
upon
the
table
there
was
nothing
to
come
but
two
or
three
square
inches
of
cold
bacon
not
eat
turbot
in
lent
had
he
been
one
of
her
own
sort
she
might
have
given
him
credit
for
true
antagonism
to
popery
but
every
inch
of
his
coat
gave
the
lie
to
such
a
supposition
as
that
do
take
a
bit
said
townsend
hospitably
the
fins
should
not
have
been
cut
off
otherwise
i
never
saw
a
finer
fish
in
my
life
none
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
carter
with
sternest
reprobation
of
feature
it
was
too
much
for
townsend
oh
√¶neas
said
she
what
are
we
to
do
townsend
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
while
he
helped
himself
his
feelings
were
less
acute
perhaps
than
those
of
his
wife
and
he
no
doubt
was
much
more
hungry
carter
the
while
sat
by
saying
nothing
but
looking
daggers
he
also
was
hungry
but
under
such
circumstances
he
would
rather
starve
than
eat
do
you
ever
eat
fish
mr
carter
said
townsend
proceeding
to
help
himself
for
a
second
time
and
poking
about
round
the
edges
of
the
delicate
creature
before
him
for
some
relics
of
the
glutinous
morsels
which
he
loved
so
well
he
was
not
however
enjoying
it
as
he
should
have
done
for
seeing
that
his
guest
ate
none
and
that
his
wife
appetite
was
thoroughly
marred
he
was
alone
in
his
occupation
no
one
but
a
glutton
could
have
feasted
well
under
such
circumstances
and
townsend
was
not
a
glutton
thank
you
i
will
eat
none
said
carter
sitting
bolt
upright
and
fixing
his
keen
gray
eyes
on
the
wall
opposite
then
you
may
take
away
biddy
i
done
with
it
but
it
a
thousand
pities
such
a
fish
should
have
been
so
wasted
the
female
heart
of
townsend
could
stand
these
wrongs
no
longer
and
with
a
tear
in
one
corner
of
her
eye
and
a
gleam
of
anger
in
the
other
she
at
length
thus
spoke
out
i
am
sure
then
i
do
know
what
you
will
eat
carter
and
i
did
think
that
all
you
english
clergymen
always
ate
fish
in
lent
and
indeed
nothing
else
for
indeed
people
do
say
that
you
are
much
the
same
as
the
papists
in
that
respect
hush
my
dear
said
townsend
well
but
i
ca
hush
when
there
nothing
for
the
gentleman
to
eat
my
dear
madam
such
a
matter
does
not
signify
in
the
least
said
carter
not
unbending
an
inch
but
it
does
signify
it
signifies
a
great
deal
and
so
you
know
if
you
were
a
family
man
as
you
ought
to
be
townsend
would
have
been
delighted
to
add
and
i
sure
i
sent
jerry
five
miles
and
he
was
gone
four
hours
to
get
that
bit
of
fish
from
paddy
magrath
as
he
stops
always
at
ballygibblin
gate
and
indeed
i
thought
myself
so
lucky
for
i
only
gave
jerry
one
and
sixpence
but
they
had
an
uncommon
take
of
fish
yesterday
at
skibbereen
and
one
and
sixpence
said
carter
now
slightly
relaxing
his
brow
for
the
first
time
i
have
got
it
for
one
and
three
said
townsend
upon
whose
mind
an
inkling
of
the
truth
was
beginning
to
dawn
indeed
and
you
would
√¶neas
and
jerry
was
forced
to
promise
the
man
a
glass
of
whisky
the
first
time
he
comes
this
road
which
he
does
sometimes
that
fish
weighed
over
nine
pounds
every
ounce
of
it
nine
fiddlesticks
said
townsend
i
weighed
it
myself
√¶neas
with
my
own
hands
and
it
was
nine
pounds
four
ounces
before
we
were
obliged
to
cut
it
and
as
firm
as
a
rock
the
flesh
was
for
one
and
sixpence
said
carter
relaxing
still
a
little
further
and
condescending
to
look
his
hostess
in
the
face
yes
for
one
and
six
and
now
i
sure
i
have
bought
it
for
one
and
four
fins
and
all
said
the
parson
determined
to
interrupt
his
wife
in
her
pathos
i
sure
you
would
not
then
said
his
wife
taking
his
assertion
in
earnest
you
could
never
market
against
jerry
in
your
life
i
will
say
that
for
him
if
you
allow
me
to
change
my
mind
i
think
i
will
have
a
little
bit
of
it
said
carter
almost
humbly
by
all
means
said
townsend
biddy
bring
that
fish
back
now
i
think
of
it
i
have
not
half
dined
myself
yet
and
then
they
all
three
forgot
their
ill
humours
and
enjoyed
their
dinner
thoroughly
in
spite
of
the
acknowledged
fault
as
touching
the
lost
fins
of
the
animal
chapter
xxxviii
condemned
i
have
said
that
lord
desmond
rode
home
from
hap
house
that
day
in
a
quieter
mood
and
at
a
slower
pace
than
that
which
had
brought
him
thither
and
in
truth
it
was
so
he
had
things
to
think
of
now
much
more
serious
than
any
that
had
filled
his
mind
as
he
had
cantered
along
joyously
hoping
that
after
all
he
might
have
for
his
brother
the
man
that
he
loved
and
the
owner
of
castle
richmond
also
this
was
now
impossible
but
he
felt
that
he
loved
owen
better
than
ever
he
had
done
and
he
was
pledged
to
fight
owen
battle
let
owen
be
ever
so
poor
and
what
does
it
signify
after
all
he
said
to
himself
as
he
rode
along
we
shall
all
be
poor
together
and
then
we
mind
it
so
much
and
if
i
do
marry
hap
house
itself
will
be
something
to
add
to
the
property
and
then
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
be
happy
enough
living
at
desmond
court
all
his
life
so
long
as
he
could
have
owen
fitzgerald
near
him
to
make
life
palatable
that
night
he
spoke
to
no
one
on
the
subject
at
least
to
no
one
of
his
own
accord
when
they
were
alone
his
mother
asked
him
where
he
had
been
and
when
she
learned
that
he
had
been
at
hap
house
she
questioned
him
much
as
to
what
had
passed
between
him
and
owen
but
he
would
tell
her
nothing
merely
saying
that
owen
had
spoken
of
clara
with
his
usual
ecstasy
of
love
but
declining
to
go
into
the
subject
at
any
length
the
countess
however
gathered
from
him
that
he
and
owen
were
on
kindly
terms
together
and
so
far
she
felt
satisfied
on
the
following
morning
he
made
up
his
mind
to
have
it
out
as
he
called
it
with
clara
but
when
the
hour
came
his
courage
failed
him
it
was
a
difficult
task
that
which
he
was
now
to
undertake
of
explaining
to
her
his
wish
that
she
should
go
back
to
her
old
lover
not
because
he
was
no
longer
poor
but
as
it
were
in
spite
of
his
poverty
and
as
a
reward
to
him
for
consenting
to
remain
poor
as
he
had
thought
about
it
while
riding
home
it
had
seemed
feasible
enough
he
would
tell
her
how
nobly
owen
was
going
to
behave
to
herbert
and
would
put
it
to
her
whether
as
he
intended
willingly
to
abandon
the
estate
he
ought
not
to
be
put
into
possession
of
the
wife
there
was
a
romantic
justice
about
this
which
he
thought
would
touch
clara
heart
but
on
the
following
morning
when
he
came
to
think
what
words
he
would
use
for
making
his
little
proposition
the
picture
did
not
seem
to
him
to
be
so
beautiful
if
clara
really
loved
herbert
and
she
had
declared
that
she
did
twenty
times
over
it
would
be
absurd
to
expect
her
to
give
him
up
merely
because
he
was
not
a
ruined
man
but
then
which
did
she
love
his
mother
declared
that
she
loved
owen
that
the
real
question
said
the
earl
to
himself
as
on
the
second
morning
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
have
it
out
with
clara
without
any
further
delay
he
must
be
true
to
owen
that
was
his
first
great
duty
at
the
present
moment
clara
i
want
to
talk
to
you
he
said
breaking
suddenly
into
the
room
where
she
usually
sat
alone
o
mornings
i
was
at
hap
house
the
day
before
yesterday
with
owen
fitzgerald
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
at
once
we
were
talking
about
you
the
whole
time
we
were
there
and
now
what
i
want
is
that
something
should
be
settled
so
that
we
may
all
understand
one
another
these
words
he
spoke
to
her
quite
abruptly
when
he
first
said
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
her
she
had
got
up
from
her
chair
to
welcome
him
for
she
dearly
loved
to
have
him
there
there
was
nothing
she
liked
better
than
having
him
to
herself
when
he
was
in
a
soft
brotherly
humour
and
then
she
would
interest
herself
about
his
horse
and
his
dogs
and
his
gun
and
predict
his
life
for
him
sending
him
up
as
a
peer
to
parliament
and
giving
him
a
noble
wife
and
promising
him
that
he
should
be
such
a
desmond
as
would
redeem
all
the
family
from
their
distresses
but
now
as
he
rapidly
brought
out
his
words
she
found
that
on
this
day
her
prophecies
must
regard
herself
chiefly
surely
patrick
it
is
easy
enough
to
understand
me
she
said
well
i
do
know
i
do
in
the
least
mean
to
find
fault
with
you
i
am
glad
of
that
dearest
she
said
laying
her
hand
upon
his
arm
but
my
mother
says
one
thing
and
you
another
and
owen
another
and
i
myself
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
look
here
patrick
it
is
simply
this
i
became
engaged
to
herbert
with
my
mother
sanction
and
yours
and
now
stop
a
moment
said
the
impetuous
boy
and
do
not
pledge
yourself
to
anything
till
you
have
heard
me
i
know
that
you
are
cut
to
the
heart
about
herbert
fitzgerald
losing
his
property
no
indeed
not
at
all
cut
to
the
heart
that
is
as
regards
myself
i
do
mean
as
regards
yourself
i
mean
as
regards
him
i
have
heard
you
say
over
and
over
again
that
it
is
a
piteous
thing
that
he
should
be
so
treated
have
i
not
yes
i
have
said
that
and
i
think
so
and
i
think
that
most
of
your
great
great
great
love
for
him
if
you
will
comes
from
that
sort
of
feeling
but
patrick
it
came
long
before
dear
clara
do
listen
to
me
will
you
you
may
at
any
rate
do
as
much
as
that
for
me
and
then
clara
stood
perfectly
mute
looking
into
his
handsome
face
as
he
continued
to
rattle
out
his
words
at
her
now
if
you
please
clara
you
may
have
the
means
of
giving
back
to
him
all
his
property
every
shilling
that
he
ever
had
or
expected
to
have
owen
fitzgerald
who
certainly
is
the
finest
fellow
that
ever
i
came
across
in
all
my
life
or
ever
shall
if
i
live
to
five
hundred
says
that
he
will
make
over
every
acre
of
castle
richmond
back
to
his
cousin
herbert
if
oh
my
lord
my
lord
what
a
scheme
is
this
you
are
concocting
to
entrap
your
sister
owen
fitzgerald
inserted
no
if
as
you
are
well
aware
if
he
continued
with
some
little
qualm
of
conscience
if
you
will
consent
to
be
his
wife
patrick
listen
now
listen
he
thinks
and
clara
by
the
heavens
above
me
i
think
also
that
you
did
love
him
better
than
you
ever
loved
herbert
fitzgerald
clara
as
she
heard
these
words
blushed
ruby
red
up
to
her
very
hair
but
she
said
never
a
word
and
i
think
and
he
thinks
that
you
are
bound
now
to
herbert
by
his
misfortunes
that
you
feel
that
you
can
not
desert
him
because
he
has
fallen
so
low
by
george
clara
i
am
proud
of
you
for
sticking
to
him
through
thick
and
thin
now
that
he
is
down
but
the
matter
will
be
very
difficult
if
you
have
the
means
of
giving
back
to
him
all
that
he
has
lost
as
you
have
owen
will
be
poor
but
he
is
a
prince
among
men
by
heaven
clara
if
you
will
only
say
that
he
is
your
choice
herbert
shall
have
back
all
castle
richmond
and
i
i
shall
never
marry
and
you
may
give
to
the
man
that
i
love
as
my
brother
all
that
there
is
left
to
us
of
desmond
there
was
something
grand
about
the
lad
eager
tone
of
voice
as
he
made
his
wild
proposal
and
something
grand
also
about
his
heart
he
meant
what
he
said
foolish
as
he
was
either
to
mean
or
to
say
it
clara
burst
into
tears
and
threw
herself
into
his
arms
you
understand
she
said
through
her
sobs
my
own
own
brother
you
do
not
understand
but
by
jove
i
think
i
do
understand
as
sure
as
you
are
a
living
girl
he
will
give
back
castle
richmond
to
herbert
fitzgerald
she
recovered
herself
and
leaving
her
brother
arms
walked
away
to
the
window
and
from
thence
looked
down
to
that
path
beneath
the
elms
which
was
the
spot
in
the
world
which
she
thought
of
the
oftenest
but
as
she
gazed
there
was
no
lack
of
loyalty
in
her
heart
to
the
man
to
whom
she
was
betrothed
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
those
childish
days
had
been
in
another
life
as
though
owen
had
been
her
lover
in
another
world
a
sweet
childish
innocent
happy
world
which
she
remembered
well
but
which
was
now
dissevered
from
her
by
an
impassable
gulf
she
thought
of
his
few
words
of
love
so
few
that
she
remembered
every
word
that
he
had
then
spoken
and
thought
of
them
with
a
singular
mixture
of
pain
and
pleasure
and
now
she
heard
of
his
noble
with
a
thrill
which
was
in
no
degree
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
she
or
even
herbert
was
to
be
the
gainer
by
it
she
rejoiced
at
his
nobility
merely
because
it
was
a
joy
to
her
to
know
that
he
was
so
noble
and
yet
all
through
this
she
was
true
to
herbert
another
world
had
come
upon
her
in
her
womanhood
and
as
that
came
she
had
learned
to
love
a
man
of
another
stamp
with
a
love
that
was
quieter
more
subdued
and
perhaps
as
she
thought
more
enduring
whatever
might
be
herbert
lot
in
life
that
lot
she
would
share
her
love
for
owen
should
never
be
more
to
her
than
a
dream
did
he
send
you
to
me
she
said
at
last
without
turning
her
face
away
from
the
window
yes
then
he
did
he
did
send
me
to
you
and
he
told
me
to
say
that
as
owen
of
hap
house
he
loved
you
still
and
i
i
promised
to
do
his
bidding
and
i
promised
moreover
that
as
far
as
my
good
word
could
go
with
you
he
should
have
it
and
now
you
know
it
all
if
you
care
for
my
pleasure
in
the
matter
you
will
take
owen
and
let
herbert
have
his
property
by
jove
if
he
is
treated
in
that
way
he
can
not
complain
patrick
said
she
returning
to
him
and
again
laying
her
hand
on
him
you
must
now
take
my
message
also
you
must
go
to
him
and
bid
him
come
here
that
i
may
see
him
who
owen
yes
owen
fitzgerald
very
well
i
have
no
objection
in
life
and
the
earl
thought
that
the
difficulty
was
really
about
to
be
overcome
and
about
my
mother
i
will
tell
mamma
and
what
shall
i
say
to
owen
say
nothing
to
him
but
bid
him
come
here
but
wait
patrick
yes
he
must
not
misunderstand
me
i
can
never
never
never
marry
him
clara
never
never
it
is
impossible
dear
patrick
i
am
so
sorry
to
make
you
unhappy
and
i
love
you
so
very
dearly
better
than
ever
i
think
for
speaking
as
you
do
now
but
that
can
never
be
let
him
come
here
however
and
i
myself
will
tell
him
all
at
last
disgusted
and
unhappy
though
he
was
the
earl
did
accept
the
commission
and
again
on
that
afternoon
rode
across
the
fields
to
hap
house
i
will
tell
him
nothing
but
that
he
is
to
come
said
the
earl
to
himself
as
he
went
thither
and
he
did
tell
owen
nothing
else
fitzgerald
questioned
him
much
but
learned
but
little
from
him
by
heavens
owen
he
said
you
must
settle
the
matter
between
you
for
i
do
understand
it
she
has
bid
me
ask
you
to
come
to
her
and
now
you
must
fight
your
own
battle
fitzgerald
of
course
said
that
he
would
obey
and
so
lord
desmond
left
him
in
the
evening
clara
told
her
mother
owen
fitzgerald
is
to
be
here
she
said
owen
fitzgerald
is
he
said
the
countess
she
hardly
knew
how
to
bear
herself
or
how
to
interfere
so
as
to
assist
her
own
object
or
how
not
to
interfere
lest
she
should
mar
it
yes
mamma
patrick
saw
him
the
other
day
and
i
think
it
is
better
that
i
should
see
him
also
very
well
my
dear
but
you
must
be
aware
clara
that
you
have
been
so
very
i
do
wish
to
say
headstrong
exactly
so
very
about
your
own
affairs
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
speak
of
them
if
your
brother
is
in
your
confidence
i
shall
be
satisfied
he
is
in
my
confidence
and
so
may
you
be
also
mamma
if
you
please
but
the
countess
thought
it
better
not
to
have
any
conversation
forced
upon
her
at
that
moment
and
so
she
asked
her
daughter
for
no
further
show
of
confidence
then
it
would
probably
be
as
well
that
owen
should
come
and
plead
his
own
cause
and
owen
did
come
all
that
night
and
on
the
next
morning
the
poor
girl
remained
alone
in
a
state
of
terrible
doubt
she
had
sent
for
her
old
lover
thinking
at
the
moment
that
no
one
could
explain
to
him
in
language
so
clear
as
her
own
what
was
her
fixed
resolve
and
she
had
too
been
so
moved
by
the
splendour
of
his
offer
that
she
longed
to
tell
him
what
she
thought
of
it
the
grandeur
of
that
offer
was
enhanced
tenfold
in
her
mind
by
the
fact
that
it
had
been
so
framed
as
to
include
her
in
this
comparative
poverty
with
which
owen
himself
was
prepared
to
rest
contented
he
had
known
that
she
was
not
to
be
bought
by
wealth
and
had
given
her
credit
for
a
nobility
that
was
akin
to
his
own
but
yet
now
that
the
moment
was
coming
how
was
she
to
talk
to
him
how
was
she
to
speak
the
words
which
would
rob
him
of
his
hope
and
tell
him
that
he
did
not
could
not
never
could
possess
that
one
treasure
which
he
desired
more
than
houses
and
lands
or
station
and
rank
alas
alas
if
it
could
have
been
otherwise
if
it
could
have
been
otherwise
she
also
was
in
love
with
poverty
but
at
any
rate
no
one
could
accuse
her
now
of
sacrificing
a
poor
lover
for
a
rich
one
herbert
fitzgerald
would
be
poor
enough
and
then
he
came
they
had
hitherto
met
but
once
since
that
afternoon
now
so
long
ago
that
afternoon
to
which
she
looked
back
as
to
another
former
world
and
that
meeting
had
been
in
the
very
room
in
which
she
was
now
prepared
to
receive
him
but
her
feelings
towards
him
had
been
very
different
then
then
he
had
almost
forced
himself
upon
her
and
for
months
previously
she
had
heard
nothing
of
him
but
what
was
evil
he
had
come
complaining
loudly
and
her
heart
had
been
somewhat
hardened
against
him
now
he
was
there
at
her
bidding
and
her
heart
and
very
soul
were
full
of
tenderness
she
rose
rapidly
and
sat
down
again
and
then
again
rose
as
she
heard
his
footsteps
but
when
he
entered
the
room
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
it
clara
he
said
taking
the
hand
which
she
mechanically
held
out
i
have
come
here
now
at
your
brother
request
her
name
sounded
so
sweet
upon
his
lips
no
idea
occurred
to
her
that
she
ought
to
be
angry
with
him
for
using
it
angry
with
him
could
it
be
possible
that
she
should
ever
be
angry
with
him
that
she
ever
had
been
so
yes
she
said
patrick
said
something
to
me
which
made
me
think
that
it
would
be
better
that
we
should
meet
well
yes
it
is
better
if
people
are
honest
they
had
always
better
say
to
each
other
faces
that
which
they
have
to
say
i
mean
to
be
honest
mr
fitzgerald
yes
i
am
sure
you
do
and
so
do
i
also
and
if
this
is
so
why
can
not
we
say
each
to
the
other
that
which
we
have
to
say
my
tale
will
be
a
very
short
one
but
it
will
be
true
if
it
is
short
but
fitzgerald
well
clara
will
you
not
sit
down
and
she
herself
sat
upon
the
sofa
and
he
drew
a
chair
for
himself
near
to
her
but
he
was
too
impetuous
to
remain
seated
on
it
long
during
the
interview
between
them
he
was
sometimes
standing
and
sometimes
walking
quickly
about
the
room
and
then
for
a
moment
he
would
sit
down
or
lean
down
over
her
on
the
sofa
arm
but
fitzgerald
it
is
my
tale
that
i
wish
you
to
hear
well
i
will
listen
to
it
but
he
did
not
listen
for
before
she
had
spoken
a
dozen
words
he
had
interrupted
her
and
poured
out
upon
her
his
own
wild
plans
and
generous
schemes
she
poor
girl
had
thought
to
tell
him
that
she
loved
herbert
and
herbert
only
as
a
lover
but
that
if
she
could
love
him
him
owen
as
a
brother
and
a
friend
that
love
she
would
so
willingly
give
him
and
then
she
would
have
gone
on
to
say
how
impossible
it
would
have
been
for
herbert
under
any
circumstances
to
have
availed
himself
of
such
generosity
as
that
which
had
been
offered
but
her
eloquence
was
all
cut
short
in
the
bud
how
could
she
speak
with
such
a
storm
of
impulse
raging
before
her
as
that
which
was
now
strong
within
owen
bosom
he
interrupted
her
before
she
had
spoken
a
dozen
words
in
order
that
he
might
exhibit
before
her
eyes
the
project
with
which
his
bosom
was
filled
this
he
did
standing
for
the
most
part
before
her
looking
down
upon
her
as
she
sat
beneath
him
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
while
his
were
riveted
on
her
face
she
knew
it
all
before
all
this
that
he
had
to
say
to
her
or
she
would
hardly
have
understood
it
from
his
words
they
were
so
rapid
and
vehement
and
yet
they
were
tender
too
spoken
in
a
loving
tone
and
containing
ever
and
anon
assurances
of
respect
and
a
resolve
to
be
guided
now
and
for
ever
by
her
wishes
even
though
those
wishes
should
be
utterly
subversive
of
his
happiness
and
now
you
know
it
all
he
said
at
last
and
as
for
my
property
that
is
safe
enough
no
earthly
consideration
would
induce
me
to
put
a
hand
upon
that
seeing
that
by
all
justice
it
is
his
but
in
this
she
hardly
yet
quite
understood
him
let
him
have
what
luck
he
may
in
other
respects
he
shall
still
be
master
of
castle
richmond
if
it
were
that
that
you
wanted
as
i
know
it
is
not
that
i
can
not
give
you
i
can
not
tell
you
with
what
scorn
i
should
regard
myself
if
i
were
to
take
advantage
of
such
an
accident
as
this
to
rob
any
man
of
his
estate
her
brother
had
been
right
so
clara
felt
when
he
declared
that
owen
fitzgerald
was
the
finest
fellow
that
ever
he
had
come
across
she
made
another
such
declaration
within
her
own
heart
only
with
words
that
were
more
natural
to
her
he
was
the
noblest
gentleman
of
whom
she
had
ever
heard
or
read
or
thought
but
continued
owen
as
i
will
not
interfere
with
him
in
that
which
should
be
his
neither
should
he
interfere
with
me
in
that
which
should
be
mine
clara
the
only
estate
that
i
claim
is
your
heart
and
that
estate
she
could
not
give
him
on
that
at
any
rate
she
was
fixed
she
could
not
barter
herself
about
from
one
to
the
other
either
as
a
or
a
counterpoise
all
his
pleading
was
in
vain
all
his
generosity
would
fail
in
securing
to
him
this
one
reward
that
he
desired
and
now
she
had
to
tell
him
so
your
brother
seems
to
think
he
continued
that
you
still
but
now
it
was
her
turn
to
interrupt
him
patrick
is
mistaken
she
said
with
her
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
ground
what
you
will
tell
me
then
that
i
am
utterly
indifferent
to
you
no
no
no
i
did
not
say
so
and
now
she
got
up
and
took
hold
of
his
arm
and
looked
into
his
face
imploringly
i
did
not
say
so
but
oh
fitzgerald
be
kind
to
me
be
forbearing
with
me
be
good
to
me
and
she
almost
embraced
his
arm
as
she
appealed
to
him
with
her
eyes
all
swimming
with
tears
good
to
you
he
said
and
a
strong
passion
came
upon
him
urging
him
to
throw
his
arm
round
her
slender
body
and
press
her
to
his
bosom
good
to
her
would
he
not
protect
her
with
his
life
blood
against
all
the
world
if
she
would
only
come
to
him
good
to
you
clara
can
you
not
trust
me
that
i
will
be
good
to
you
if
you
will
let
me
but
not
so
owen
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
called
him
by
his
name
and
she
blushed
again
as
she
remembered
that
it
was
so
not
good
as
you
mean
for
now
i
must
trust
to
another
for
that
goodness
herbert
must
be
my
husband
owen
but
will
not
you
be
our
friend
herbert
must
be
your
husband
yes
yes
yes
it
is
so
do
not
look
at
me
in
that
way
pray
do
not
what
would
you
have
me
do
you
would
not
have
me
false
to
my
troth
and
false
to
my
own
heart
because
you
are
generous
be
generous
to
me
to
me
also
he
turned
away
from
her
and
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
long
room
away
and
back
before
he
answered
her
and
even
then
when
he
had
returned
to
her
he
stood
looking
at
her
before
he
spoke
and
she
now
looked
full
into
his
face
hoping
but
yet
fearing
hoping
that
he
might
yield
to
her
and
fearing
his
terrible
displeasure
should
he
not
yield
clara
he
said
and
he
spoke
solemnly
slowly
and
in
a
mood
unlike
his
own
i
can
not
as
yet
read
your
heart
clearly
nor
do
i
know
whether
you
can
quite
so
read
it
yourself
i
can
i
can
she
answered
quickly
and
you
shall
know
it
all
all
if
you
wish
i
want
to
know
but
one
thing
whom
is
it
that
you
love
and
clara
and
this
he
said
interrupting
her
as
she
was
about
to
speak
i
do
not
ask
you
to
whom
you
are
engaged
you
have
engaged
yourself
both
to
him
and
to
me
oh
mr
fitzgerald
i
do
not
blame
you
not
in
the
least
but
is
it
not
so
as
to
that
i
will
ask
no
question
and
say
nothing
only
this
that
so
far
we
are
equal
but
now
ask
of
your
own
heart
and
then
answer
me
whom
is
it
then
you
love
herbert
fitzgerald
she
said
the
words
hardly
formed
themselves
into
a
whisper
but
nevertheless
they
were
audible
enough
to
him
then
i
have
no
further
business
here
he
said
and
turned
about
as
though
to
leave
the
room
but
she
ran
forward
and
stopped
him
standing
between
him
and
the
door
oh
fitzgerald
do
not
leave
me
like
that
say
one
word
of
kindness
to
me
before
you
go
tell
me
that
you
forgive
me
for
the
injury
i
have
done
you
yes
i
forgive
you
and
is
that
all
oh
i
will
love
you
so
if
you
will
let
me
as
your
friend
as
your
sister
you
shall
be
our
dearest
best
and
nearest
friend
you
do
not
know
how
good
he
is
owen
will
you
not
tell
me
that
you
will
love
me
as
a
brother
loves
no
and
the
sternness
of
his
face
was
such
that
it
was
dreadful
to
look
on
it
i
will
tell
you
nothing
that
is
false
and
would
that
be
false
yes
false
as
hell
what
sit
by
at
his
and
see
you
leaning
on
his
bosom
sleep
under
his
roof
while
you
were
in
his
arms
no
lady
clara
that
would
not
be
possible
that
virtue
if
it
be
virtue
i
can
not
possess
and
you
must
go
from
me
in
anger
if
you
knew
what
i
am
suffering
you
would
not
speak
to
me
so
cruelly
cruel
i
would
not
wish
to
be
cruel
to
you
certainly
not
now
for
we
shall
not
meet
again
if
ever
not
for
many
years
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
been
cruel
to
you
then
say
one
word
of
kindness
before
you
go
a
word
of
kindness
well
what
shall
i
say
every
night
as
i
have
lain
in
my
bed
i
have
said
words
of
kindness
to
you
since
since
since
longer
than
you
will
remember
since
i
first
knew
you
as
a
child
do
you
ever
think
of
the
day
when
you
walked
with
me
round
by
the
bridge
it
is
bootless
thinking
of
that
now
bootless
yes
and
words
of
kindness
are
bootless
between
you
and
me
such
words
should
be
full
of
love
or
they
would
have
no
meaning
what
can
i
say
to
you
that
shall
be
both
kind
and
true
bid
god
bless
me
before
you
leave
me
well
i
will
say
that
may
god
bless
you
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
and
now
lady
clara
desmond
and
he
tendered
to
her
his
hand
she
took
it
and
pressed
it
between
both
of
hers
and
looked
up
into
his
face
and
stood
so
while
the
fast
tears
ran
down
her
face
he
must
have
been
more
or
less
than
man
had
he
not
relented
then
and
owen
she
said
dear
owen
may
god
in
his
mercy
bless
you
also
and
make
you
happy
and
give
you
some
one
that
you
can
love
and
and
teach
you
in
your
heart
to
forgive
the
injury
i
have
done
you
and
then
she
stooped
down
her
head
and
pressed
her
lips
upon
the
hand
which
she
held
within
her
own
forgive
you
well
i
do
forgive
you
perhaps
it
may
be
right
that
we
should
both
forgive
though
i
have
not
wittingly
brought
unhappiness
upon
you
but
what
there
is
to
be
forgiven
on
my
side
i
do
forgive
and
and
i
hope
that
you
may
be
happy
they
were
the
last
words
that
he
spoke
and
then
leading
her
back
to
her
seat
he
placed
her
there
and
without
turning
to
look
at
her
again
he
left
the
room
he
hurried
down
into
the
court
and
called
for
his
horse
as
he
stood
there
when
his
foot
was
in
the
stirrup
and
his
hand
on
the
neck
lord
desmond
came
up
to
him
desmond
he
said
it
is
all
over
god
knows
when
you
and
i
may
meet
again
and
without
waiting
for
a
word
of
reply
he
rode
out
under
the
porch
and
putting
spurs
to
his
horse
galloped
fast
across
the
park
the
earl
when
he
spoke
of
it
afterwards
to
his
mother
said
that
owen
face
had
been
as
it
were
a
thundercloud
chapter
xxxix
in
spinny
lane
i
think
it
will
be
acknowledged
that
prendergast
had
said
no
word
throughout
the
conversation
recorded
in
a
late
chapter
as
having
taken
place
between
him
and
herbert
fitzgerald
over
their
wine
which
could
lead
herbert
to
think
it
possible
that
he
might
yet
recover
his
lost
inheritance
but
nevertheless
during
the
whole
of
that
evening
he
held
in
his
pocket
a
letter
received
by
him
only
that
afternoon
which
did
encourage
him
to
think
that
such
an
event
might
at
any
rate
be
possible
and
indeed
he
held
in
his
pocket
two
letters
having
a
tendency
to
the
same
effect
but
we
shall
have
nothing
now
to
say
as
to
that
letter
from
somers
of
which
we
have
spoken
before
it
must
be
understood
that
up
to
this
time
certain
inquiries
had
been
going
on
with
reference
to
the
life
of
matthew
mollett
and
that
these
inquiries
were
being
made
by
agents
employed
by
prendergast
he
had
found
that
mollett
identity
with
talbot
had
been
so
fully
proved
as
to
make
it
in
his
opinion
absolutely
necessary
that
herbert
and
his
mother
should
openly
give
up
castle
richmond
but
nevertheless
without
a
hope
and
in
obedience
solely
to
what
he
felt
that
prudence
demanded
in
so
momentous
a
matter
he
did
prosecute
all
manner
of
inquiries
but
prosecuted
them
altogether
in
vain
and
now
o
thou
most
acute
of
lawyers
this
new
twinkling
spark
of
hope
has
come
to
thee
from
a
source
whence
thou
least
expectedst
it
minime
reris
grai√¢
pandetur
ab
and
then
as
soon
as
herbert
was
gone
from
him
crossing
one
leg
over
the
other
as
he
sat
in
his
easy
chair
he
took
it
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
for
the
third
time
the
signature
at
the
end
of
it
was
very
plain
and
legible
being
that
of
a
scholar
no
less
accomplished
than
abraham
mollett
this
letter
we
will
have
entire
though
it
was
not
perhaps
as
short
as
it
might
have
been
it
ran
as

you

a
bakkin
i
ham
respictit
sir
your
umbel
servant
to
command
abm
mollett
i
can
not
say
that
prendergast
believed
much
of
this
terribly
long
epistle
when
he
first
received
it
or
felt
himself
imbued
with
any
great
hope
that
his
old
friend
wife
might
be
restored
to
her
name
and
rank
and
his
old
friend
son
to
his
estate
and
fortune
but
nevertheless
he
knew
that
it
was
worth
inquiry
that
aby
mollett
had
been
kicked
out
of
hap
house
in
a
manner
that
must
have
been
mortifying
to
his
feelings
prendergast
had
himself
seen
and
that
he
would
therefore
do
anything
in
his
power
to
injure
owen
fitzgerald
prendergast
was
quite
sure
that
he
was
a
viler
wretch
even
than
his
father
prendergast
suspected
having
been
led
to
think
so
by
words
which
had
fallen
from
sir
thomas
and
being
further
confirmed
in
that
opinion
by
the
letter
now
in
his
hand
he
was
not
therefore
led
into
any
strong
opinion
that
these
new
tidings
were
of
value
and
indeed
he
was
prone
to
disbelieve
them
because
they
ran
counter
to
a
conviction
which
had
already
been
made
in
his
own
heart
and
had
been
extensively
acted
on
by
him
nevertheless
he
resolved
that
even
aby
letter
deserved
attention
and
that
it
should
receive
that
attention
early
on
the
following
morning
and
thus
he
had
sat
for
the
three
hours
after
dinner
chatting
comfortably
with
his
young
friend
and
holding
this
letter
in
his
pocket
had
he
shown
it
to
herbert
or
spoken
of
it
he
would
have
utterly
disturbed
the
equilibrium
of
the
embryo
law
student
and
rendered
his
entrance
in
mr
die
chambers
absolutely
futile
ten
will
not
be
too
early
for
you
he
had
said
mr
die
is
always
in
his
room
by
that
hour
herbert
had
of
course
declared
that
ten
would
not
be
at
all
too
early
for
him
and
prendergast
had
observed
that
after
leaving
mr
die
chambers
he
himself
would
go
on
to
the
city
he
might
have
said
beyond
the
city
for
his
intended
expedition
was
to
spinny
lane
at
botolph
in
the
east
when
herbert
was
gone
he
sat
musing
over
his
fire
with
aby
letter
still
in
his
hand
a
lawyer
has
always
a
sort
of
affection
for
a
scoundrel
such
affection
as
a
hunting
man
has
for
a
fox
he
loves
to
watch
the
skill
and
dodges
of
the
animal
to
study
the
wiles
by
which
he
lives
and
to
circumvent
them
by
wiles
of
his
own
still
more
wily
it
is
his
glory
to
run
the
beast
down
but
then
he
would
not
for
worlds
run
him
down
except
in
conformity
with
certain
laws
fixed
by
old
custom
for
the
guidance
of
men
in
such
sports
and
the
vermin
is
adapted
for
pursuit
as
is
the
fox
with
four
legs
he
is
an
unclean
animal
leaving
a
scent
upon
his
trail
which
the
nose
of
your
acute
law
hound
can
pick
up
over
almost
any
ground
and
the
more
wily
the
beast
is
the
longer
he
can
run
the
more
trouble
he
can
give
in
the
pursuit
the
longer
he
can
stand
up
before
a
pack
of
legal
hounds
the
better
does
the
forensic
sportsman
love
and
value
him
there
are
foxes
of
so
excellent
a
nature
so
keen
in
their
dodges
so
perfect
in
their
cunning
so
skilful
in
evasion
that
a
sportsman
can
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
push
them
to
their
destruction
unless
the
field
be
very
large
so
that
many
eyes
are
looking
on
and
the
feeling
is
i
think
the
same
with
lawyers
prendergast
had
always
felt
a
tenderness
towards
the
molletts
father
and
son
a
tenderness
which
would
by
no
means
have
prevented
him
from
sending
them
both
to
the
halter
had
that
been
necessary
and
had
they
put
themselves
so
far
in
his
power
much
as
the
sportsman
loves
the
fox
it
is
a
moment
to
him
of
keen
enjoyment
when
he
puts
his
heavy
boot
on
the
beast
body
the
expectant
dogs
standing
round
demanding
their
prey
and
there
both
beheads
and
betails
him
a
grand
old
dog
he
says
to
those
around
him
i
know
him
well
it
was
he
who
took
us
that
day
from
poulnarer
through
castlecor
and
right
away
to
drumcollogher
and
then
he
throws
the
heavy
carcass
to
the
hungry
hounds
and
so
could
prendergast
have
delivered
up
either
of
the
molletts
to
be
devoured
by
the
dogs
of
the
law
but
he
did
not
the
less
love
them
tenderly
while
they
were
yet
running
and
so
he
sat
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
smiling
to
think
that
the
father
and
son
had
come
to
grief
among
themselves
smiling
also
at
the
dodge
by
which
as
he
thought
most
probable
aby
mollett
was
striving
to
injure
the
man
who
had
kicked
him
and
raise
a
little
money
for
his
own
private
needs
there
was
too
much
earnestness
in
that
prayer
for
cash
to
leave
prendergast
in
any
doubt
as
to
aby
trust
that
money
would
be
forthcoming
there
must
be
something
in
the
dodge
or
aby
would
not
have
had
such
trust
and
the
lawyer
felt
that
he
might
perhaps
be
inclined
to
give
some
little
assistance
to
poor
aby
in
the
soreness
of
his
needs
foxes
will
not
do
well
in
any
country
which
is
not
provided
with
their
natural
food
rats
they
eat
and
if
rats
be
plentiful
it
is
so
far
good
but
one
should
not
begrudge
them
occasional
geese
and
turkeys
or
even
break
one
heart
if
they
like
a
lamb
in
season
a
fox
will
always
run
well
when
he
has
come
far
from
home
seeking
his
breakfast
poor
aby
when
he
had
been
so
cruelly
treated
by
the
gent
of
appy
ouse
whose
side
in
the
family
dispute
he
had
latterly
been
so
anxious
to
take
had
remained
crouching
for
some
hour
or
two
in
owen
kitchen
absolutely
mute
the
servants
there
for
a
while
felt
sure
that
he
was
dying
but
in
their
master
present
mood
they
did
not
dare
to
go
near
him
with
any
such
tidings
and
then
when
the
hounds
were
gone
and
the
place
was
again
quiet
aby
gradually
roused
himself
allowed
them
to
wash
the
blood
from
his
hands
and
face
to
restore
him
to
life
by
whisky
and
scraps
of
food
and
gradually
got
himself
into
his
car
and
so
back
to
the
kanturk
hotel
in
south
main
street
cork
but
alas
his
state
there
was
more
wretched
by
far
than
it
had
been
in
the
hap
house
kitchen
that
his
father
had
fled
was
no
more
than
he
expected
each
had
known
that
the
other
would
now
play
some
separate
secret
game
but
not
the
less
did
he
complain
loudly
when
he
heard
that
his
guvnor
had
not
paid
the
bill
and
had
left
neither
money
nor
message
for
him
how
fanny
had
scorned
and
upbraided
him
and
ordered
tom
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
neck
and
crop
how
he
had
squared
at
tom
and
ultimately
had
been
turned
out
of
the
house
neck
and
crop
whatever
that
may
mean
by
fanny
father
needs
not
here
to
be
particularly
narrated
with
much
suffering
and
many
privations
such
as
foxes
in
their
solitary
wanderings
so
often
know
he
did
find
his
way
to
london
and
did
moreover
by
means
of
such
wiles
as
foxes
have
find
out
something
as
to
his
guvnor
whereabouts
and
some
secrets
also
as
to
his
guvnor
which
his
guvnor
would
fain
have
kept
to
himself
had
it
been
possible
and
then
also
he
again
found
for
himself
a
sort
of
home
or
hole
rather
in
his
old
original
gorse
covert
of
london
somewhere
among
the
jews
we
may
surmise
from
the
name
of
the
row
from
which
he
dated
and
here
setting
to
work
once
more
with
his
usual
cunning
industry
for
your
fox
is
very
industrious
he
once
more
attempted
to
build
up
a
slender
fortune
by
means
of
the
fitsjerral
family
the
grand
days
in
which
he
could
look
for
the
hand
of
the
fair
emmeline
were
all
gone
by
but
still
the
property
had
been
too
good
not
to
leave
something
for
which
he
might
grasp
properly
worked
by
himself
alone
as
he
said
to
himself
it
might
still
yield
him
some
comfortable
returns
especially
as
he
should
be
able
to
throw
over
that
confouned
old
guvnor
of
his
he
remained
at
home
the
whole
of
the
day
after
his
letter
was
written
indeed
for
the
next
three
days
thinking
that
prendergast
would
come
to
him
or
send
for
him
but
prendergast
did
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
prendergast
took
his
advice
instead
and
putting
himself
into
a
hansom
cab
had
himself
driven
to
centbotollfs
intheheast
spinny
lane
botolph
in
the
east
when
at
last
it
was
found
was
not
exactly
the
sort
of
place
that
prendergast
had
expected
it
must
be
known
that
he
did
not
allow
the
cabman
to
drive
him
up
to
the
very
door
indicated
nor
even
to
the
lane
itself
but
contented
himself
with
leaving
the
cab
at
botolph
church
the
huntsman
in
looking
after
his
game
is
as
wily
as
the
fox
himself
men
do
not
talk
at
the
covert
side
or
at
any
rate
they
ought
not
and
they
should
stand
together
discreetly
at
the
side
all
manner
of
wiles
and
silences
and
discretions
are
necessary
though
too
often
broken
through
by
the
uninstructed
much
to
their
own
discomfort
and
so
in
hunting
his
fox
prendergast
did
not
dash
up
loudly
into
the
covert
but
discreetly
left
his
cab
at
the
church
of
botolph
spinny
lane
when
at
last
found
by
intelligence
given
to
him
at
the
baker
never
in
such
unknown
regions
ask
a
lad
in
the
street
for
he
invariably
will
accompany
you
talking
of
your
whereabouts
very
loudly
so
that
people
stare
at
you
and
ask
each
other
what
can
possibly
be
your
business
in
those
parts
spinny
lane
i
say
was
not
the
sort
of
locality
that
he
had
expected
he
knew
the
look
of
the
alsatias
of
the
rascals
and
spinny
lane
did
not
at
all
bear
their
character
it
was
a
street
of
small
new
tenements
built
as
yet
only
on
one
side
of
the
way
with
the
pavement
only
one
third
finished
and
the
stones
in
the
road
as
yet
unbroken
and
untrodden
of
such
streets
there
are
thousands
now
round
london
they
are
to
be
found
in
every
suburb
creating
wonder
in
all
thoughtful
minds
as
to
who
can
be
their
tens
of
thousands
of
occupants
the
houses
are
a
little
too
good
for
artisans
too
small
and
too
silent
to
be
the
abode
of
various
lodgers
and
too
mean
for
clerks
who
live
on
salaries
they
are
as
as
lethe
itself
dull
and
silent
dingy
and
repulsive
but
they
are
not
discreditable
in
appearance
and
never
have
that
mohawk
look
which
by
some
unknown
sympathy
in
bricks
and
mortar
attaches
itself
to
the
residences
of
professional
ruffians
number
seven
he
found
to
be
as
quiet
and
decent
a
house
as
any
in
the
row
and
having
inspected
it
from
a
little
distance
he
walked
up
briskly
to
the
door
and
rang
the
bell
he
walked
up
briskly
in
order
that
his
advance
might
not
be
seen
unless
indeed
as
he
began
to
think
not
impossible
aby
statement
was
altogether
a
hoax
does
a
woman
named
mary
swan
live
here
he
asked
of
a
young
woman
of
some
seven
or
eight
and
twenty
who
opened
the
door
for
him
she
was
decent
looking
but
poverty
stricken
and
wan
with
work
and
care
and
with
that
heaviness
about
her
which
perpetual
sorrow
always
gives
otherwise
she
would
not
have
been
ill
featured
and
even
as
it
was
she
was
feminine
and
soft
in
her
gait
and
manner
does
mary
swan
live
here
asked
prendergast
in
a
mild
voice
she
at
once
said
mary
swan
did
live
there
but
she
stood
with
the
door
in
her
hand
by
no
means
fully
opened
as
though
she
did
not
wish
to
ask
him
to
enter
and
yet
there
was
nothing
in
her
tone
to
repel
him
prendergast
at
once
felt
that
he
was
on
the
right
scent
and
that
it
behoved
him
at
any
rate
to
make
his
way
into
that
house
for
if
ever
a
daughter
was
like
an
father
that
young
woman
was
like
mollett
senior
then
i
will
see
her
if
you
please
said
prendergast
entering
the
passage
without
her
invitation
not
that
he
pushed
in
with
roughness
but
she
receded
before
the
authority
of
his
tone
and
obeyed
the
command
which
she
read
in
his
eye
the
poor
young
woman
hesitated
as
though
it
had
been
her
intention
to
declare
that
swan
was
not
within
but
if
so
she
had
not
strength
to
carry
out
her
purpose
for
in
the
next
moment
prendergast
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
woman
he
had
come
to
seek
mary
swan
said
prendergast
asking
a
question
as
to
her
identity
yes
sir
that
is
my
name
said
a
elderly
woman
rising
from
her
chair
the
room
in
which
the
two
had
been
sitting
was
very
poor
but
nevertheless
it
was
neat
and
arranged
with
some
attention
to
appearance
it
was
not
carpeted
but
there
was
a
piece
of
drugget
some
three
yards
long
spread
before
the
fireplace
the
wall
had
been
papered
from
time
to
time
with
scraps
of
different
coloured
paper
as
opportunity
offered
the
table
on
which
the
work
of
the
two
women
was
lying
was
very
old
and
somewhat
rickety
but
it
was
of
mahogany
and
mary
swan
herself
was
accommodated
with
a
which
gave
some
appearance
of
comfort
to
her
position
it
was
now
spring
but
they
had
a
small
very
small
fire
in
the
small
grate
on
which
a
pot
had
been
placed
in
hopes
that
it
might
be
induced
to
boil
all
these
things
did
the
eye
of
prendergast
take
in
but
the
fact
which
his
eye
took
in
with
its
keenest
glance
was
this
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
to
that
on
which
sat
mary
swan
there
was
a
second
standing
close
over
the
fender
an
ordinary
old
mahogany
chair
in
which
it
was
evident
that
the
younger
woman
had
not
been
sitting
her
place
had
been
close
to
the
where
her
needles
and
thread
were
still
lying
but
the
was
placed
idly
away
from
any
accommodation
for
work
and
had
as
prendergast
thought
been
recently
filled
by
some
idle
person
the
woman
who
rose
from
her
chair
as
she
declared
herself
to
be
mary
swan
was
old
and
sickly
looking
but
nevertheless
there
was
that
about
her
which
was
prepossessing
her
face
was
thin
and
delicate
and
pale
and
not
hard
and
coarse
her
voice
was
low
as
a
woman
should
be
and
her
hands
were
white
and
small
her
clothes
though
very
poor
were
neat
and
worn
as
a
poor
lady
might
have
worn
them
though
there
was
in
her
face
an
aspect
almost
of
terror
as
she
owned
to
her
name
in
the
stranger
presence
yet
there
was
also
about
her
a
certain
amount
of
female
dignity
which
made
prendergast
feel
that
it
behoved
him
to
treat
her
not
only
with
gentleness
but
also
with
respect
i
want
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
said
he
in
consequence
of
a
letter
i
have
received
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
sit
down
for
a
minute
or
two
certainly
sir
certainly
this
is
my
daughter
mary
swan
do
you
wish
that
she
should
leave
the
room
sir
and
mary
swan
as
her
mother
spoke
got
up
and
prepared
to
depart
quietly
by
no
means
by
no
means
said
prendergast
putting
his
hand
out
so
as
to
detain
her
i
would
much
rather
that
she
should
remain
as
it
may
be
very
likely
that
she
may
assist
me
in
my
inquiries
you
will
know
who
i
am
no
doubt
when
i
mention
my
name
mollett
will
have
mentioned
me
to
you
i
am
mr
prendergast
no
sir
he
never
did
said
swan
oh
said
prendergast
having
ascertained
that
mollett
was
at
any
rate
well
known
at
no
spinny
lane
i
thought
that
he
might
probably
have
done
so
he
is
at
home
at
present
i
believe
sir
said
mary
swan
senior
your
father
is
at
home
i
believe
said
prendergast
turning
to
the
younger
woman
sir
said
mary
swan
junior
it
was
clear
at
any
rate
that
the
women
were
not
practised
liars
for
they
could
not
bring
themselves
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
deny
that
he
was
in
the
house
prendergast
did
not
wish
to
be
confronted
at
present
with
matthew
mollett
such
a
step
might
or
might
not
be
desirable
before
the
termination
of
the
interview
but
at
the
present
moment
he
thought
that
he
might
probably
learn
more
from
the
two
women
as
they
were
than
he
would
do
if
mollett
were
with
them
it
had
been
acknowledged
to
him
that
mollett
was
living
in
that
house
that
he
was
now
at
home
and
also
that
the
younger
woman
present
before
him
was
the
child
of
mollett
and
of
mary
swan
the
elder
that
the
young
woman
was
older
than
herbert
fitzgerald
and
that
therefore
the
connection
between
mollett
and
her
mother
must
have
been
prior
to
that
marriage
down
in
dorsetshire
he
was
sure
but
then
it
might
still
be
possible
that
there
had
been
no
marriage
between
mollett
and
mary
swan
if
he
could
show
that
they
had
been
man
and
wife
when
that
child
was
born
then
would
his
old
friend
mr
die
lose
his
new
pupil
i
have
a
letter
in
my
pocket
swan
from
abraham
mollett
prendergast
commenced
pulling
out
the
letter
in
question
he
is
nothing
to
me
sir
said
the
woman
almost
in
a
tone
of
anger
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
him
so
i
should
have
supposed
from
the
respectability
of
your
appearance
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
nothing
at
all
sir
and
as
for
that
we
do
try
to
keep
ourselves
respectable
but
this
is
a
very
hard
world
for
some
people
to
live
in
it
has
been
very
hard
to
me
and
this
poor
girl
here
it
is
a
hard
world
to
some
people
and
to
some
honest
people
too
which
is
harder
still
we
always
tried
to
be
honest
said
mary
swan
the
elder
i
am
sure
you
have
and
permit
me
to
say
madam
that
you
will
find
it
at
the
last
to
be
the
best
policy
at
the
last
even
as
far
as
this
world
is
concerned
but
about
this
letter
i
can
assure
you
that
i
have
never
thought
of
identifying
you
with
abraham
mollett
his
mother
was
dead
sir
before
ever
i
set
eyes
on
him
or
his
father
and
though
i
tried
to
do
my
and
then
she
stopped
herself
suddenly
honesty
might
be
the
best
policy
but
nevertheless
was
it
necessary
that
she
should
tell
everything
to
this
stranger
ah
yes
abraham
mother
was
dead
before
you
were
married
said
prendergast
hunting
his
fox
ever
so
craftily
his
fox
whom
he
knew
to
be
lying
in
ambush
up
stairs
it
was
of
course
possible
that
old
mollett
should
slip
away
out
of
the
back
door
and
over
a
wall
if
foxes
did
not
do
those
sort
of
things
they
would
not
be
worth
half
the
attention
that
is
paid
to
them
but
prendergast
was
well
on
the
scent
all
that
a
sportsman
wants
is
good
scent
he
would
rather
not
have
a
view
till
the
run
comes
to
its
close
but
continued
prendergast
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
say
a
few
words
to
you
about
this
letter
abraham
mother
was
i
suppose
not
exactly
an
an
educated
woman
i
never
saw
her
sir
she
died
when
he
was
very
young
four
years
old
sir
and
her
son
hardly
seems
to
have
had
much
education
it
was
his
own
fault
sir
i
sent
him
to
school
when
he
came
to
me
though
goodness
knows
sir
i
was
short
enough
of
means
of
doing
so
he
had
better
opportunities
than
my
own
daughter
there
and
though
i
say
it
myself
who
ought
not
to
say
it
she
is
a
good
scholar
i
sure
she
is
and
a
very
good
young
woman
too
if
i
can
judge
by
her
appearance
but
about
this
letter
i
am
afraid
your
husband
has
not
been
so
particular
in
his
way
of
living
as
he
should
have
been
what
could
i
do
sir
a
poor
weak
woman
nothing
what
you
could
do
i
sure
you
did
do
i
always
kept
a
house
over
my
head
though
it
very
humble
as
you
see
sir
and
he
has
had
a
morsel
to
eat
and
a
cup
to
drink
of
when
he
has
come
here
it
is
not
often
that
he
has
troubled
me
this
many
years
past
mother
said
mary
swan
the
younger
the
gentleman
wo
care
to
know
about
about
all
that
between
you
and
father
ah
but
it
is
just
what
i
do
care
to
know
but
sir
father
perhaps
might
choose
it
the
obedience
of
women
to
men
to
those
men
to
whom
they
are
legally
bound
is
i
think
the
most
remarkable
trait
in
human
nature
nothing
equals
it
but
the
instinctive
loyalty
of
a
dog
of
course
we
hear
of
gray
mares
and
of
garments
worn
by
the
wrong
persons
xanthippe
doubtless
did
live
and
the
character
from
time
to
time
is
repeated
but
the
rule
i
think
is
as
i
have
said
swan
said
prendergast
i
should
think
myself
dishonest
were
i
to
worm
your
secrets
out
of
you
seeing
that
you
are
yourself
so
truthful
and
so
respectable
perhaps
it
may
be
thought
that
prendergast
was
a
little
late
in
looking
at
the
matter
in
this
light
but
it
behoves
me
to
learn
much
of
the
early
history
of
your
husband
who
is
now
living
with
you
here
and
whose
name
as
i
take
it
is
not
swan
but
mollett
your
maiden
name
probably
was
swan
but
i
was
honestly
married
sir
in
the
parish
church
at
putney
and
that
young
woman
was
honestly
born
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
i
have
never
doubted
it
but
as
i
was
saying
i
have
come
here
for
information
about
your
husband
and
i
do
not
like
to
ask
you
questions
off
your
guard
oh
mr
prendergast
and
therefore
i
think
it
right
to
tell
you
that
neither
i
nor
those
for
whom
i
am
concerned
have
any
wish
to
bear
more
heavily
than
we
can
help
upon
your
husband
if
he
will
only
come
forward
with
willingness
to
do
that
which
we
can
make
him
do
either
willingly
or
unwillingly
but
what
was
it
about
abraham
letter
sir
well
it
does
not
so
much
signify
now
it
was
he
sent
you
here
was
it
sir
how
has
he
learned
where
we
are
mary
and
the
poor
woman
turned
to
her
daughter
the
truth
is
sir
he
has
never
known
anything
of
us
for
these
twenty
years
nor
we
of
him
i
have
not
set
eyes
on
him
for
more
than
twenty
years
not
that
i
know
of
and
he
never
knew
me
by
any
other
name
than
swan
and
when
he
was
a
child
he
took
me
for
his
aunt
he
has
known
then
that
you
and
his
father
were
husband
and
wife
i
have
always
thought
he
did
sir
but
how
then
after
all
the
young
fox
had
not
been
so
full
of
craft
as
the
elder
one
thought
prendergast
to
himself
but
nevertheless
he
still
liked
the
old
fox
best
there
are
foxes
that
run
so
uncommonly
short
that
you
can
never
get
a
burst
after
them
i
suppose
swan
continued
prendergast
that
you
have
heard
the
name
of
fitzgerald
the
poor
woman
sat
silent
and
amazed
but
after
a
moment
the
daughter
answered
him
my
mother
sir
would
rather
that
you
should
ask
her
no
questions
but
my
good
girl
your
mother
i
suppose
would
wish
to
protect
your
father
and
she
would
not
wish
to
answer
these
questions
in
a
court
of
law
heaven
forbid
said
the
poor
woman
your
father
has
behaved
very
badly
to
an
unfortunate
lady
whose
friend
i
am
and
on
her
behalf
i
must
learn
the
truth
he
has
behaved
badly
sir
to
a
great
many
ladies
said
swan
or
mollett
as
we
may
now
call
her
you
are
aware
are
you
not
that
he
went
through
a
form
of
marriage
with
this
lady
many
years
ago
said
prendergast
almost
severely
let
him
answer
for
himself
said
the
true
wife
mary
go
up
stairs
and
ask
your
father
to
come
down
chapter
xl
the
fox
in
his
earth
mary
swan
the
younger
hesitated
a
moment
before
she
executed
her
mother
order
not
saying
anything
but
looking
doubtfully
up
into
her
mother
face
go
my
dear
said
the
old
woman
and
ask
your
father
to
come
down
it
is
no
use
denying
him
none
in
the
least
said
prendergast
and
then
the
daughter
went
for
ten
minutes
the
lawyer
and
the
old
woman
sat
alone
during
which
time
the
ear
of
the
former
was
keenly
alive
to
any
steps
that
might
be
heard
on
the
stairs
or
above
head
not
that
he
would
himself
have
taken
any
active
measures
to
prevent
mollett
escape
had
such
an
attempt
been
made
the
woman
could
be
a
better
witness
for
him
than
the
man
and
there
would
be
no
fear
of
her
running
nevertheless
he
was
anxious
that
mollett
should
of
his
own
accord
come
into
his
presence
i
am
sorry
to
keep
you
so
long
waiting
sir
said
swan
it
does
not
signify
i
can
easily
understand
that
your
husband
should
wish
to
reflect
a
little
before
he
speaks
to
me
i
can
forgive
that
and
sir
well
mrs
mollett
are
you
going
to
do
anything
to
punish
him
sir
if
a
poor
woman
may
venture
to
speak
a
word
i
would
beg
you
on
my
bended
knees
to
be
merciful
to
him
if
you
would
forgive
him
now
i
think
he
would
live
honest
and
be
sorry
for
what
he
has
done
he
has
worked
terrible
evil
said
prendergast
solemnly
do
you
know
that
he
has
harassed
a
poor
gentleman
into
his
grave
heaven
be
merciful
to
him
said
the
poor
woman
but
sir
was
not
that
his
son
was
it
not
abraham
mollett
who
did
that
oh
sir
if
you
will
let
a
poor
wife
speak
it
is
he
that
has
been
worse
than
his
father
before
prendergast
had
made
up
his
mind
how
he
would
answer
her
he
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
slowly
descending
upon
the
stairs
they
were
those
of
a
person
who
stepped
heavily
and
feebly
and
it
was
still
a
minute
before
the
door
was
opened
sir
said
the
woman
sir
and
as
she
spoke
she
looked
eagerly
into
his
face
forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
them
that
trespass
against
us
we
should
all
remember
that
sir
true
mollett
quite
true
and
prendergast
rose
from
his
chair
as
the
door
opened
it
will
be
remembered
that
prendergast
and
matthew
mollett
had
met
once
before
in
the
room
usually
occupied
by
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
on
that
occasion
mollett
had
at
any
rate
entered
the
chamber
with
some
of
the
prestige
of
power
about
him
he
had
come
to
castle
richmond
as
the
man
having
the
whip
hand
and
though
his
courage
had
certainly
fallen
somewhat
before
he
left
it
nevertheless
he
had
not
been
so
beaten
down
but
what
he
was
able
to
say
a
word
or
two
for
himself
he
had
been
well
in
health
and
decent
in
appearance
and
even
as
he
left
the
room
had
hardly
realized
the
absolute
ruin
which
had
fallen
upon
him
but
now
he
looked
as
though
he
had
realized
it
with
sufficient
clearness
he
was
lean
and
sick
and
pale
and
seemed
to
be
ten
years
older
than
when
prendergast
had
last
seen
him
he
was
wrapped
in
an
old
and
had
a
on
his
head
and
coughed
violently
before
he
got
himself
into
his
chair
it
is
hard
for
any
tame
domestic
animal
to
know
through
what
fire
and
water
a
poor
fox
is
driven
as
it
is
hunted
from
hole
to
hole
and
covert
to
covert
it
is
a
wonderful
fact
but
no
less
a
fact
that
no
men
work
so
hard
and
work
for
so
little
pay
as
scoundrels
who
strive
to
live
without
any
work
at
all
and
to
feed
on
the
sweat
of
other
men
brows
poor
matthew
mollett
had
suffered
dire
misfortune
had
encountered
very
hard
lines
betwixt
that
day
on
which
he
stole
away
from
the
kanturk
hotel
in
south
main
street
cork
and
that
other
day
on
which
he
presented
himself
cold
and
hungry
and
almost
sick
to
death
at
the
door
of
his
wife
house
in
spinny
lane
botolph
in
the
east
he
never
showed
himself
there
unless
when
hard
pressed
indeed
and
then
he
would
skulk
in
seeking
for
shelter
and
food
and
pleading
with
bated
voice
his
husband
right
to
assistance
and
comfort
nor
was
his
plea
ever
denied
him
on
this
occasion
he
had
arrived
in
very
bad
plight
indeed
he
had
brought
away
from
cork
nothing
but
what
he
could
carry
on
his
body
and
had
been
forced
to
pawn
what
he
could
pawn
in
order
that
he
might
subsist
and
then
he
had
been
taken
with
ague
and
with
the
fit
strong
on
him
had
crawled
away
to
spinny
lane
and
had
there
been
nursed
by
the
mother
and
daughter
whom
he
had
ill
used
deserted
and
betrayed
when
the
devil
was
sick
the
devil
a
monk
would
be
and
now
his
wife
credulous
as
all
women
are
in
such
matters
believed
the
devil
protestations
a
time
may
perhaps
come
when
even
but
stop
or
i
may
chance
to
tread
on
the
corns
of
orthodoxy
what
i
mean
to
insinuate
is
this
that
it
was
on
the
cards
that
mollett
would
now
at
last
turn
over
a
new
leaf
how
do
you
do
mr
mollett
said
prendergast
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
looking
so
poorly
yes
sir
i
am
poorly
enough
certainly
i
have
been
very
ill
since
i
last
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
sir
ah
yes
that
was
at
castle
richmond
was
it
not
well
you
have
done
the
best
thing
that
a
man
can
do
you
have
come
home
to
your
wife
and
family
now
that
you
are
ill
and
require
their
attendance
mollett
looked
up
at
him
with
a
countenance
full
of
unutterable
woe
and
weakness
what
was
he
to
say
on
such
a
subject
in
such
a
company
there
sat
his
wife
and
daughter
his
veritable
wife
and
daughter
on
whom
he
was
now
dependent
and
in
whose
hands
he
lay
as
a
sick
man
does
lie
in
the
hands
of
women
could
he
deny
them
and
there
sat
the
awful
prendergast
the
representative
of
all
that
fitzgerald
interest
which
he
had
so
wronged
and
who
up
to
this
morning
had
at
any
rate
believed
the
story
with
which
he
mollett
had
pushed
his
fortunes
in
county
cork
could
he
in
his
presence
acknowledge
that
lady
fitzgerald
had
never
been
his
wife
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
was
in
a
sore
plight
and
then
remember
his
ague
you
feel
yourself
tolerably
comfortable
i
suppose
now
that
you
are
with
your
wife
and
daughter
continued
prendergast
most
inhumanly
mollett
continued
to
look
at
him
so
piteously
from
beneath
his
nightcap
i
am
better
than
i
was
thank
you
sir
said
he
there
is
nothing
like
the
bosom
of
one
family
for
restoring
one
to
health
is
there
mollett
or
for
keeping
one
in
health
i
wish
you
gentlemen
would
think
so
said
she
drily
as
for
me
i
never
was
blessed
with
a
wife
when
i
am
sick
i
have
to
trust
to
hired
attendance
in
that
respect
i
am
not
so
fortunate
as
your
husband
i
am
only
an
old
bachelor
oh
ai
you
sir
said
mollett
and
perhaps
it
best
so
it
ai
all
married
people
that
are
the
happiest
the
daughter
during
this
time
was
sitting
intent
on
her
work
not
lifting
her
face
from
the
shirt
she
was
sewing
but
an
observer
might
have
seen
from
her
forehead
and
eye
that
she
was
not
only
listening
to
what
was
said
but
thinking
and
meditating
on
the
scene
before
her
well
mollett
said
prendergast
you
at
any
rate
are
not
an
old
bachelor
mollett
still
looked
piteously
at
him
but
said
nothing
it
may
be
thought
that
in
all
this
prendergast
was
more
cruel
than
necessary
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
was
incumbent
on
him
to
bring
the
poor
wretch
before
him
down
absolutely
on
his
mollett
must
be
made
to
confess
his
sin
and
own
that
this
woman
before
him
was
his
real
wife
and
the
time
for
mercy
had
not
commenced
till
that
had
been
done
and
then
his
daughter
spoke
seeing
how
things
were
going
with
him
father
said
she
this
gentleman
has
called
because
he
has
had
a
letter
from
abraham
mollett
and
he
was
speaking
about
what
abraham
has
been
doing
in
ireland
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
poor
mollett
the
unfortunate
young
man
that
wretched
unfortunate
young
man
he
will
bring
me
to
the
grave
at
last
to
the
grave
at
last
come
mollett
said
prendergast
now
getting
up
and
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
i
do
not
know
that
you
and
i
need
beat
about
the
bush
much
longer
i
suppose
i
may
speak
openly
before
these
ladies
as
to
what
has
been
taking
place
in
county
cork
sir
said
mollett
with
a
look
of
deprecation
about
his
mouth
that
ought
to
have
moved
the
lawyer
heart
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
mollett
very
stiffly
yes
mother
we
do
know
something
about
it
and
the
gentleman
may
speak
out
if
it
so
pleases
him
it
will
be
better
father
for
you
that
he
should
do
so
very
well
my
dear
said
mollett
in
the
lowest
possible
voice
whatever
the
gentleman
likes
only
i
do
hope
and
he
uttered
a
deep
sigh
and
gave
no
further
expression
to
his
hopes
or
wishes
i
presume
in
the
first
place
began
prendergast
that
this
lady
here
is
your
legal
wife
and
this
younger
lady
your
legitimate
daughter
there
is
no
doubt
i
take
it
as
to
that
not
any
doubt
in
the
world
sir
said
the
mollett
who
claimed
to
be
so
de
jure
i
have
got
my
marriage
lines
to
show
sir
abraham
mother
was
dead
just
six
months
before
we
came
together
and
then
we
were
married
just
six
months
after
that
well
mollett
i
suppose
you
do
not
wish
to
contradict
that
he
ca
sir
whether
he
wish
it
or
not
said
mollett
could
you
show
me
that
that
marriage
certificate
asked
prendergast
mollett
looked
rather
doubtful
as
to
this
it
may
be
that
much
as
she
trusted
in
her
husband
reform
she
did
not
wish
to
let
him
know
where
she
kept
this
important
palladium
of
her
rights
it
can
be
forthcoming
sir
whenever
it
may
be
wanted
said
mary
mollett
the
younger
and
then
prendergast
seeing
what
was
passing
through
the
minds
of
the
two
women
did
not
press
that
matter
any
further
but
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
from
your
own
lips
mollett
that
you
acknowledge
the
marriage
which
took
place
at
at
fulham
i
think
you
said
at
putney
sir
at
putney
parish
church
in
the
year
of
our
lord
eighteen
hundred
and
fourteen
ah
that
was
the
year
before
mollett
went
into
dorsetshire
yes
sir
he
did
stay
with
me
long
not
at
that
time
he
went
away
and
left
me
and
then
all
that
happened
that
you
know
of
down
in
dorsetshire
as
they
told
me
and
afterwards
when
he
went
away
on
his
keeping
leaving
aby
behind
i
took
the
child
and
said
that
i
was
his
aunt
there
were
reasons
then
and
i
feared
but
never
mind
about
that
sir
for
anything
that
i
was
wrong
enough
to
say
then
to
the
contrary
i
am
his
lawful
wedded
wife
and
before
my
face
he
wo
deny
it
and
then
when
he
was
sore
pressed
and
in
trouble
he
came
back
to
me
and
after
that
mary
here
was
born
and
one
other
a
boy
who
god
rest
him
has
gone
from
these
troubles
and
since
that
it
is
not
often
that
he
has
been
with
me
but
now
now
that
he
is
here
you
should
have
pity
on
us
and
give
him
another
chance
but
still
mollett
had
said
nothing
himself
he
sat
during
all
this
time
wearily
moving
his
head
to
and
fro
as
though
the
conversation
were
anything
but
comfortable
to
him
and
indeed
it
can
not
be
presumed
to
have
been
very
pleasant
he
moved
his
head
slowly
and
wearily
to
and
fro
every
now
and
then
lifting
up
one
hand
weakly
as
though
deprecating
any
recurrence
to
circumstances
so
decidedly
unpleasant
but
prendergast
was
determined
that
he
should
speak
mollett
said
he
i
must
beg
you
to
say
in
so
many
words
whether
the
statement
of
this
lady
is
correct
or
is
incorrect
do
you
acknowledge
her
for
your
lawful
wife
he
dare
deny
me
sir
said
the
woman
who
was
perhaps
a
little
too
eager
in
the
matter
father
why
do
you
behave
like
a
man
and
speak
said
his
daughter
now
turning
upon
him
you
have
done
ill
to
all
of
us
to
so
many
but
now
and
are
you
going
to
turn
against
me
mary
he
whined
out
almost
crying
turn
against
you
no
i
have
never
done
that
but
look
at
mother
would
you
let
that
gentleman
think
that
she
is
what
i
wo
name
before
him
will
you
say
that
i
am
not
your
child
you
have
done
very
wickedly
and
you
must
now
make
what
amends
is
in
your
power
if
you
do
not
answer
him
here
he
will
make
you
answer
in
some
worse
place
than
this
what
is
it
i
am
to
say
sir
he
whined
out
again
is
this
lady
here
your
legal
wife
yes
sir
said
the
poor
man
whimpering
and
that
marriage
ceremony
which
you
went
through
in
dorsetshire
with
miss
wainwright
was
not
a
legal
marriage
i
suppose
not
sir
you
were
well
aware
at
the
time
that
you
were
committing
bigamy
sir
you
knew
i
say
that
you
were
committing
bigamy
that
the
child
whom
you
were
professing
to
marry
would
not
become
your
wife
through
that
ceremony
i
say
that
you
knew
all
this
at
the
time
come
mollett
answer
me
if
you
do
not
wish
me
to
have
you
dragged
out
of
this
by
a
policeman
and
taken
at
once
before
a
magistrate
oh
sir
be
merciful
to
us
pray
be
merciful
to
us
said
mollett
holding
up
her
apron
to
her
eyes
father
why
do
you
speak
out
plainly
to
the
gentleman
he
will
forgive
you
if
you
do
that
am
i
to
criminate
myself
sir
said
mollett
still
in
the
humblest
voice
in
the
world
and
hardly
above
his
breath
after
all
this
fox
had
still
some
running
left
in
him
prendergast
thought
to
himself
he
was
not
even
yet
so
thoroughly
beaten
but
what
he
had
a
dodge
or
two
remaining
at
his
service
am
i
to
criminate
myself
sir
he
asked
as
innocently
as
a
child
might
ask
whether
or
no
she
were
to
stand
longer
in
the
corner
you
may
do
as
you
like
about
that
mollett
said
the
lawyer
i
am
neither
a
magistrate
nor
a
policeman
and
at
the
present
moment
i
am
not
acting
even
as
a
lawyer
i
am
the
friend
of
a
family
whom
you
have
misused
and
defrauded
most
outrageously
you
have
killed
the
father
of
that
family
oh
gracious
said
mollett
yes
madam
he
has
done
so
and
nearly
broken
the
heart
of
that
poor
lady
and
driven
her
son
from
the
house
which
is
his
own
you
have
done
all
this
in
order
that
you
might
swindle
them
out
of
money
for
your
vile
indulgences
while
you
left
your
own
wife
and
your
own
child
to
starve
at
home
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
i
never
came
across
so
mean
a
scoundrel
and
now
you
chaffer
with
me
as
to
whether
or
no
you
shall
criminate
yourself
scoundrel
and
villain
as
you
are
a
scoundrel
still
there
are
reasons
why
i
shall
not
wish
to
have
you
gibbeted
as
you
deserve
oh
sir
he
has
done
nothing
that
would
come
to
that
said
the
poor
wife
you
had
better
let
the
gentleman
finish
said
the
daughter
he
does
mean
that
father
will
be
hung
it
would
be
too
good
for
him
said
prendergast
who
was
now
absolutely
almost
out
of
temper
but
i
do
not
wish
to
be
his
executioner
for
the
peace
of
that
family
which
you
have
so
brutally
plundered
and
ill
used
i
shall
remain
quiet
if
i
can
attain
my
object
without
a
public
prosecution
but
remember
that
i
guarantee
nothing
to
you
for
aught
i
know
you
may
be
in
gaol
before
the
night
is
come
all
i
have
to
tell
you
is
this
that
if
by
obtaining
a
confession
from
you
i
am
able
to
restore
my
friends
to
their
property
without
a
prosecution
i
shall
do
so
now
you
may
answer
me
or
not
as
you
like
trust
him
father
said
the
daughter
it
will
be
best
for
you
but
i
have
told
him
everything
said
mollett
what
more
does
he
want
of
me
i
want
you
to
give
your
written
acknowledgment
that
when
you
went
through
that
ceremony
of
marriage
with
miss
wainwright
in
dorsetshire
you
committed
bigamy
and
that
you
knew
at
that
time
that
you
were
doing
so
mollett
as
a
matter
of
course
gave
him
the
written
document
and
then
prendergast
took
his
leave
bowing
graciously
to
the
two
women
and
not
deigning
to
cast
his
eyes
again
on
the
abject
wretch
who
crouched
by
the
fire
do
be
hard
on
a
poor
creature
who
has
fallen
so
low
said
mollett
as
he
left
the
room
but
mary
mollett
junior
followed
him
to
the
door
and
opened
it
for
him
sir
she
said
addressing
him
with
some
hesitation
as
he
was
preparing
to
depart
well
miss
mollett
if
i
could
do
anything
for
you
it
would
gratify
me
for
i
sincerely
feel
for
you
both
for
you
and
for
your
mother
thank
you
sir
i
do
know
that
there
is
anything
you
can
do
for
us
except
to
spare
him
the
thief
on
the
cross
was
forgiven
sir
but
the
thief
on
the
cross
repented
and
who
shall
say
that
he
does
not
repent
you
can
not
tell
of
his
heart
by
scripture
word
as
you
can
of
that
other
one
but
our
lord
has
taught
us
that
it
is
good
to
forgive
the
worst
of
sinners
tell
that
poor
lady
to
think
of
this
when
she
remembers
him
in
her
prayers
i
will
miss
mollett
indeed
indeed
i
will
and
then
as
he
left
her
he
gave
her
his
hand
in
token
of
respect
and
so
he
walked
away
out
of
spinny
lane
chapter
xli
the
lobby
of
the
house
of
commons
prendergast
as
he
walked
out
of
spinny
lane
and
back
to
botolph
church
and
as
he
returned
thence
again
to
bloomsbury
square
in
his
cab
had
a
good
deal
of
which
to
think
in
the
first
place
it
must
be
explained
that
he
was
not
altogether
with
the
manner
in
which
things
had
gone
that
he
would
have
made
almost
any
sacrifice
to
recover
the
property
for
herbert
fitzgerald
is
certainly
true
and
it
is
as
true
that
he
would
have
omitted
no
possible
effort
to
discover
all
that
which
he
had
now
discovered
almost
without
necessity
for
any
effort
but
nevertheless
he
was
not
altogether
pleased
he
had
made
up
his
mind
a
month
or
two
ago
that
lady
fitzgerald
was
not
the
lawful
wife
of
her
husband
and
had
come
to
this
conclusion
on
as
he
still
thought
sufficient
evidence
but
now
he
was
proved
to
have
been
wrong
his
character
for
shrewdness
and
discernment
would
be
damaged
and
his
great
ally
and
chum
mr
die
the
chancery
barrister
would
be
down
on
him
with
unmitigated
sarcasm
a
man
who
has
been
right
so
frequently
as
prendergast
does
not
like
to
find
that
he
is
ever
in
the
wrong
and
then
had
his
decision
not
have
been
sudden
might
not
the
life
of
that
old
baronet
have
been
saved
prendergast
could
not
help
feeling
this
in
some
degree
as
he
drove
away
to
bloomsbury
square
but
nevertheless
he
had
also
the
feeling
of
having
achieved
a
great
triumph
it
was
with
him
as
with
a
man
who
has
made
a
fortune
when
he
has
declared
to
his
friends
that
he
should
infallibly
be
ruined
it
piques
him
to
think
how
wrong
he
has
been
in
his
prophecy
but
still
it
is
very
pleasant
to
have
made
one
fortune
when
he
found
himself
at
the
top
of
chancery
lane
in
holborn
he
stopped
his
cab
and
got
out
of
it
he
had
by
that
time
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
would
do
so
he
walked
briskly
down
to
stone
buildings
and
nodding
to
the
old
clerk
with
whom
he
was
very
intimate
asked
if
he
could
see
mr
die
it
was
his
second
visit
to
those
chambers
that
morning
seeing
that
he
had
been
there
early
in
the
day
introducing
herbert
to
his
new
gamaliel
yes
mr
die
is
in
said
the
clerk
smiling
and
so
prendergast
passed
on
into
the
dingy
temple
of
the
chancery
god
himself
there
he
remained
for
full
an
hour
a
message
in
the
meanwhile
having
been
sent
out
to
herbert
fitzgerald
begging
him
not
to
leave
the
chambers
till
he
should
have
seen
mr
die
and
your
friend
prendergast
is
with
him
said
the
clerk
a
very
nice
gentleman
is
prendergast
uncommon
clever
too
but
it
seems
to
me
that
he
never
can
hold
his
own
when
he
comes
across
our
mr
die
at
the
end
of
the
hour
herbert
was
summoned
into
the
sanctum
and
there
he
found
mr
die
sitting
in
his
accustomed
chair
with
his
body
much
bent
nursing
the
calf
of
his
leg
which
was
always
enveloped
in
a
black
close
pantaloon
and
smiling
very
blandly
prendergast
had
in
his
countenance
not
quite
so
sweet
an
aspect
mr
die
had
repeated
to
him
perhaps
once
too
often
a
very
motto
of
his
one
by
the
aid
of
which
he
professed
to
have
steered
himself
safely
through
the
shoals
of
life
himself
and
perhaps
some
others
it
was
a
motto
which
he
would
have
loved
to
see
inscribed
over
the
great
gates
of
the
noble
inn
to
which
he
belonged
and
which
indeed
a
few
years
since
might
have
been
inscribed
there
with
much
justice
festin√¢
lent√®
mr
die
would
say
to
all
those
who
came
to
him
in
any
sort
of
hurry
and
then
when
men
accused
him
of
being
dilatory
by
premeditation
he
would
say
no
he
had
always
recommended
despatch
festin√¢
he
would
say
festin√¢
by
all
means
but
festin√¢
lent√®
the
doctrine
had
at
any
rate
thriven
with
the
teacher
for
mr
die
had
amassed
a
large
fortune
herbert
at
once
saw
that
prendergast
was
a
little
fluttered
judging
from
what
he
had
seen
of
the
lawyer
in
ireland
he
would
have
said
that
it
was
impossible
to
flutter
prendergast
but
in
truth
greatness
is
great
only
till
it
encounters
greater
greatness
mars
and
apollo
are
terrible
and
magnificent
gods
till
one
is
enabled
to
see
them
seated
at
the
foot
of
jove
great
throne
that
apollo
prendergast
though
greatly
in
favour
with
the
old
chancery
jupiter
had
now
been
reminded
that
he
had
also
on
this
occasion
driven
his
team
too
fast
and
been
nearly
as
indiscreet
in
his
own
rash
offering
we
are
very
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
here
fitzgerald
said
mr
die
giving
his
hand
to
the
young
man
without
however
rising
from
his
chair
especially
sorry
seeing
that
it
is
your
first
day
in
harness
but
your
friend
prendergast
thinks
it
as
well
that
we
should
talk
over
together
a
piece
of
business
which
does
not
seem
as
yet
to
be
quite
settled
herbert
of
course
declared
that
he
had
been
in
no
hurry
to
go
away
he
was
he
said
quite
ready
to
talk
over
anything
but
to
his
mind
at
that
moment
nothing
occurred
more
momentous
than
the
nature
of
the
agreement
between
himself
and
mr
die
there
was
an
honorarium
which
it
was
presumed
mr
die
would
expect
and
which
herbert
fitzgerald
had
ready
for
the
occasion
i
hardly
know
how
to
describe
what
has
taken
place
this
morning
since
i
saw
you
said
prendergast
whose
features
told
plainly
that
something
more
important
than
the
honorarium
was
now
on
the
tapis
what
has
taken
place
said
herbert
whose
mind
now
flew
off
to
castle
richmond
gently
gently
said
mr
die
in
the
whole
course
of
my
legal
experience
and
that
now
has
been
a
very
long
experience
i
have
never
come
across
so
so
singular
a
family
history
as
this
of
yours
fitzgerald
when
our
friend
prendergast
here
on
his
return
from
ireland
first
told
me
the
whole
of
it
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
he
had
formed
a
right
and
just
decision
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
that
said
herbert
stop
a
moment
my
dear
sir
wait
half
a
moment
a
just
decision
i
say
regarding
the
evidence
of
the
facts
as
conclusive
but
i
was
not
quite
so
certain
that
he
might
not
have
been
a
little
premature
perhaps
may
be
too
strong
a
word
a
little
too
assured
in
taking
those
facts
as
proved
but
they
were
proved
said
herbert
i
shall
always
maintain
that
there
was
ample
ground
to
induce
me
to
recommend
your
poor
father
so
to
regard
them
said
prendergast
stoutly
you
must
remember
that
those
men
would
instantly
have
been
at
work
on
the
other
side
indeed
one
of
them
did
attempt
it
without
any
signal
success
i
believe
said
mr
die
my
father
thought
you
were
quite
right
prendergast
said
herbert
with
a
tear
forming
in
his
eye
and
though
it
may
be
possible
that
the
affair
hurried
him
to
his
death
there
was
no
alternative
but
that
he
should
know
the
whole
at
this
prendergast
seemed
to
wince
as
he
sat
in
his
chair
and
i
am
sure
of
this
continued
herbert
that
had
he
been
left
to
the
villanies
of
those
two
men
his
last
days
would
have
been
much
less
comfortable
than
they
were
my
mother
feels
that
quite
as
strongly
as
i
do
and
then
prendergast
looked
as
though
he
were
somewhat
reassured
it
was
a
difficult
crisis
in
which
to
act
said
prendergast
and
i
can
only
say
that
i
did
so
to
the
best
of
my
poor
judgment
it
was
a
difficult
crisis
in
which
to
act
said
mr
die
assenting
but
why
is
all
this
brought
up
now
asked
herbert
festin√¢
lent√®
said
mr
die
lent√®
lent√®
lent√®
always
lent√®
the
more
haste
we
make
in
trying
to
understand
each
other
with
the
less
speed
shall
we
arrive
at
that
object
what
is
it
mr
prendergast
again
demanded
herbert
who
was
now
too
greatly
excited
to
care
much
for
the
chancery
wisdom
of
the
great
barrister
has
anything
new
turned
up
about
about
those
molletts
yes
herbert
something
has
turned
up
remember
prendergast
that
your
evidence
is
again
incomplete
upon
my
word
sir
i
do
not
think
it
is
it
would
be
sufficient
for
any
intellectual
jury
in
a
common
law
court
said
prendergast
who
sometimes
behind
his
back
gave
to
mr
die
the
surname
of
cunctator
but
juries
in
common
law
courts
are
not
always
intelligent
and
you
may
be
sure
prendergast
that
any
gentleman
taking
up
the
case
on
the
other
side
would
have
as
much
to
say
for
his
client
as
your
counsel
would
have
for
yours
remember
you
have
not
even
been
to
putney
yet
been
to
putney
said
herbert
who
was
becoming
uneasy
the
onus
probandi
would
lie
with
them
said
prendergast
we
take
possession
of
that
which
is
our
own
till
it
is
proved
to
belong
to
others
you
have
already
abandoned
the
possession
no
we
have
done
nothing
already
we
have
taken
no
legal
step
when
we
believed
having
by
your
own
act
put
yourself
in
your
present
position
i
think
you
ought
to
be
very
careful
before
you
take
up
another
certainly
we
ought
to
be
careful
but
i
do
maintain
that
we
may
be
too
punctilious
as
a
matter
of
course
i
shall
go
to
putney
to
putney
said
herbert
fitzgerald
yes
herbert
and
now
if
mr
die
will
permit
i
will
tell
you
what
has
happened
on
yesterday
afternoon
before
you
came
to
dine
with
me
i
received
that
letter
no
that
is
from
your
cousin
owen
fitzgerald
you
must
see
that
also
it
was
this
one
from
the
younger
mollett
the
man
whom
you
saw
that
day
in
your
poor
father
room
herbert
anxiously
put
out
his
hand
for
the
letter
but
he
was
again
interrupted
by
mr
die
i
beg
your
pardon
fitzgerald
for
a
moment
prendergast
let
me
see
that
letter
again
will
you
and
taking
hold
of
it
he
proceeded
to
read
it
very
carefully
still
nursing
his
leg
with
his
left
hand
while
he
held
the
letter
with
his
right
what
it
all
about
said
herbert
appealing
to
prendergast
almost
in
a
whisper
lent√®
lent√®
lent√®
my
dear
fitzgerald
said
mr
die
while
his
eyes
were
still
intent
upon
the
paper
if
you
will
take
advantage
of
the
experience
of
gray
hairs
and
bald
heads
his
own
was
as
bald
all
round
as
a
big
white
stone
you
must
put
up
with
some
of
the
disadvantages
of
a
momentary
delay
suppose
now
prendergast
that
he
is
acting
in
concert
with
those
people
in
what
do
you
call
the
street
in
spinny
lane
yes
with
his
father
and
the
two
women
there
what
could
they
gain
by
that
share
with
him
whatever
he
might
be
able
to
get
out
of
you
the
man
would
never
accuse
himself
of
bigamy
for
that
besides
you
should
have
seen
the
women
die
seen
the
women
tsh
tsh
tsh
i
have
seen
enough
of
them
young
and
old
to
know
that
a
clean
apron
and
a
humble
tone
and
a
eye
do
always
go
with
a
true
tongue
and
an
honest
heart
women
are
now
the
most
successful
swindlers
of
the
age
that
profession
at
any
rate
is
not
closed
against
them
you
will
not
find
these
women
to
be
swindlers
at
least
i
think
not
ah
but
we
want
to
be
sure
prendergast
and
then
mr
die
finished
the
letter
very
leisurely
as
herbert
thought
when
he
had
finished
it
he
folded
it
up
and
gave
it
back
to
prendergast
i
do
think
but
what
you
a
strong
prim√¢
facie
case
so
strong
that
perhaps
you
are
right
to
explain
the
whole
matter
to
our
young
friend
here
who
is
so
deeply
concerned
in
it
but
at
the
same
time
i
should
caution
him
that
the
matter
is
still
enveloped
in
doubt
herbert
eagerly
put
out
his
hand
for
the
letter
you
may
trust
me
with
it
said
he
i
am
not
of
a
sanguine
temperament
nor
easily
excited
and
you
may
be
sure
that
i
will
not
take
it
for
more
than
it
is
worth
so
saying
he
at
last
got
hold
of
the
letter
and
managed
to
read
it
through
much
more
quickly
than
mr
die
had
done
as
he
did
so
he
became
very
red
in
the
face
and
too
plainly
showed
that
he
had
made
a
false
boast
in
speaking
of
the
coolness
of
his
temperament
indeed
the
stakes
were
so
high
that
it
was
difficult
for
a
young
man
to
be
cool
while
he
was
playing
the
game
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
lose
and
to
that
he
had
been
reconciled
but
now
again
every
pulse
of
his
heart
and
every
nerve
of
his
body
was
disturbed
was
never
his
wife
he
said
out
loud
when
he
got
to
that
part
of
the
letter
his
real
wife
living
now
in
spinny
lane
do
you
believe
that
mr
prendergast
yes
i
do
said
the
attorney
lent√®
lent√®
lent√®
said
the
barrister
quite
oppressed
by
his
friend
unprofessional
abruptness
but
i
do
believe
it
said
prendergast
you
must
always
understand
herbert
that
this
new
story
may
possibly
not
be
true
quite
possible
said
mr
die
with
something
almost
approaching
to
a
slight
laugh
but
the
evidence
is
so
strong
continued
the
other
that
i
do
believe
it
heartily
i
have
been
to
that
house
and
seen
the
man
old
mollett
and
the
woman
whom
i
believe
to
be
his
wife
and
a
daughter
who
lives
with
them
as
far
as
my
poor
judgment
goes
and
he
made
a
bow
of
deference
towards
the
barrister
whose
face
however
seemed
to
say
that
in
his
opinion
the
judgment
of
his
friend
prendergast
did
not
always
go
very
far
as
far
as
my
poor
judgment
goes
the
women
are
honest
and
respectable
the
man
is
as
great
a
villain
as
there
is
unhung
unless
his
son
be
a
greater
one
but
he
is
now
so
driven
into
a
corner
that
the
truth
may
be
more
serviceable
to
him
than
a
lie
people
of
that
sort
are
never
driven
into
a
corner
said
mr
die
they
may
sometimes
be
crushed
to
death
well
i
believe
the
matter
is
as
i
tell
you
there
at
any
rate
is
mollett
assurance
that
it
is
so
the
woman
has
been
residing
in
the
same
place
for
years
and
will
come
forward
at
any
time
to
prove
that
she
was
married
to
this
man
before
he
ever
saw
before
he
went
to
dorsetshire
she
has
her
marriage
certificate
and
as
far
as
i
can
learn
there
is
no
one
able
or
willing
to
raise
the
question
against
you
your
cousin
owen
certainly
will
not
do
so
it
will
hardly
do
to
depend
upon
that
said
mr
die
with
another
sneer
twelve
thousand
a
year
is
a
great
provocative
to
litigation
if
he
does
we
must
fight
him
that
all
of
course
steps
will
be
taken
at
once
to
get
together
in
the
proper
legal
form
all
evidence
of
every
description
which
may
bear
on
the
subject
so
that
should
the
question
ever
be
raised
again
the
whole
matter
may
be
in
a
nutshell
you
find
it
a
nutshell
very
difficult
to
crack
in
years
time
said
mr
die
and
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
asked
herbert
that
after
all
was
now
the
main
question
and
it
was
discussed
between
them
for
a
long
time
till
the
shades
of
evening
came
upon
them
and
the
dull
dingy
chambers
became
almost
dark
as
they
sat
there
mr
die
at
first
conceived
that
it
would
be
well
that
herbert
should
still
stick
to
the
law
what
indeed
could
be
more
conducive
to
salutary
equanimity
in
the
mind
of
a
young
man
so
singularly
circumstanced
than
the
study
of
blackstone
of
coke
and
of
chitty
as
long
as
he
remained
there
at
work
in
those
chambers
amusing
himself
occasionally
with
the
eloquence
of
the
neighbouring
courts
there
might
be
reasonable
hope
that
he
would
be
able
to
keep
his
mind
equally
poised
so
that
neither
success
nor
failure
as
regarded
his
irish
inheritance
should
affect
him
injuriously
thus
at
least
argued
mr
die
but
at
this
point
herbert
seemed
to
have
views
of
his
own
he
said
that
in
the
first
place
he
must
be
with
his
mother
and
then
in
the
next
place
as
it
was
now
clear
that
he
was
not
to
throw
up
castle
richmond
as
it
would
not
now
behove
him
to
allow
any
one
else
to
call
himself
master
there
it
would
be
his
duty
to
reassume
the
place
of
master
the
onus
probandi
will
now
rest
with
them
he
said
repeating
prendergast
words
and
then
he
was
ultimately
successful
in
persuading
even
mr
die
to
agree
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
go
to
ireland
than
to
remain
in
london
sipping
the
delicious
honey
of
chancery
buttercups
and
you
will
assume
the
title
i
suppose
said
mr
die
not
at
any
rate
till
i
get
to
castle
richmond
he
said
blushing
he
had
so
completely
abandoned
all
thought
of
being
sir
herbert
fitzgerald
that
he
had
now
almost
felt
ashamed
of
saying
that
he
should
so
far
presume
as
to
call
himself
by
that
name
and
then
he
and
prendergast
went
away
and
dined
together
leaving
mr
die
to
complete
his
legal
work
for
the
day
at
this
he
would
often
sit
till
nine
or
ten
or
even
eleven
in
the
evening
without
any
apparent
ill
results
from
such
effects
and
then
go
home
to
his
dinner
and
port
wine
he
was
already
nearly
seventy
and
work
seemed
to
have
no
effect
on
him
in
what
medea
caldron
is
it
that
the
great
lawyers
so
cook
themselves
that
they
are
able
to
achieve
half
an
immortality
even
while
the
body
still
clings
to
the
soul
mr
die
though
he
would
talk
of
his
bald
head
had
no
idea
of
giving
way
to
time
superannuated
the
men
who
think
of
superannuation
at
sixty
are
those
whose
lives
have
been
idle
not
they
who
have
really
buckled
themselves
to
work
it
is
my
opinion
that
nothing
seasons
the
mind
for
endurance
like
hard
work
port
wine
should
perhaps
be
added
it
was
not
till
herbert
once
more
found
himself
alone
that
he
fully
realized
this
new
change
in
his
position
he
had
dined
with
prendergast
at
that
gentleman
club
and
had
been
specially
called
upon
to
enjoy
himself
drinking
as
it
were
to
his
own
restoration
in
large
glasses
of
some
special
claret
which
prendergast
assured
him
was
very
extraordinary
you
may
be
as
satisfied
as
that
you
are
sitting
there
that
said
he
and
i
hardly
know
anywhere
else
that
you
get
it
this
assertion
herbert
was
not
in
the
least
inclined
to
dispute
in
the
first
place
he
was
not
quite
clear
what
meant
and
then
any
other
number
or
would
have
suited
his
palate
as
well
but
he
drank
the
and
tried
to
look
as
though
he
appreciated
it
our
wines
here
are
wonderfully
cheap
said
prendergast
becoming
confidential
but
nevertheless
we
have
raised
the
price
of
that
to
twelve
shillings
we
have
another
bottle
during
all
this
herbert
could
hardly
think
of
his
own
fate
and
fortune
though
indeed
he
could
hardly
think
of
anything
else
he
was
eager
to
be
alone
that
he
might
think
and
was
nearly
when
the
second
bottle
of
made
its
appearance
something
however
was
arranged
in
those
intercalary
moments
between
the
raising
of
the
glasses
prendergast
said
that
he
would
write
both
to
owen
fitzgerald
and
to
somers
and
it
was
agreed
that
herbert
should
immediately
return
to
castle
richmond
merely
giving
his
mother
time
to
have
notice
of
his
coming
and
then
at
last
he
got
away
and
started
by
himself
for
a
night
walk
through
the
streets
of
london
it
seemed
to
him
now
to
be
a
month
since
he
had
arrived
there
but
in
truth
it
was
only
on
the
yesterday
that
he
had
got
out
of
the
train
at
the
euston
station
he
had
come
up
looking
forward
to
live
in
london
all
his
life
and
now
his
london
life
was
over
unless
indeed
those
other
hopes
should
come
back
to
him
unless
he
should
appear
again
not
as
a
student
in
mr
die
chamber
but
as
one
of
the
council
of
the
legislature
assembled
to
make
laws
for
the
governance
of
mr
die
and
of
others
it
was
singular
how
greatly
this
episode
in
his
life
had
humbled
him
in
his
own
esteem
six
months
ago
he
had
thought
himself
almost
too
good
for
castle
richmond
and
had
regarded
a
seat
in
parliament
as
the
only
place
which
he
could
fitly
fill
without
violation
to
his
nature
but
now
he
felt
as
though
he
should
hardly
dare
to
show
himself
within
the
walls
of
that
assembly
he
had
been
so
knocked
about
by
circumstances
so
rudely
toppled
from
his
high
place
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
put
himself
so
completely
into
the
hands
of
other
people
that
his
had
all
left
him
that
it
would
in
fact
return
might
be
held
as
certain
but
the
lesson
which
he
had
learned
would
not
altogether
be
thrown
away
upon
him
at
this
moment
as
i
was
saying
he
felt
himself
to
be
completely
humbled
a
lie
spoken
by
one
of
the
meanest
of
god
creatures
had
turned
him
away
from
all
his
pursuits
and
broken
all
his
hopes
and
now
another
word
from
this
man
was
to
restore
him
if
only
that
other
word
should
not
appear
to
be
the
greater
lie
and
then
that
there
should
be
such
question
as
to
his
mother
name
and
fame
as
to
the
very
name
by
which
she
should
now
be
called
that
it
should
depend
on
the
amount
of
infamy
of
which
that
wretch
had
been
guilty
whether
or
no
the
woman
whom
in
the
world
he
most
honoured
was
entitled
to
any
share
of
respect
from
the
world
around
her
that
she
was
entitled
to
the
respect
of
all
good
men
let
the
truth
in
these
matters
be
where
it
might
herbert
knew
and
all
who
heard
the
story
would
acknowledge
but
respect
is
of
two
sorts
and
the
outer
respect
of
the
world
can
not
be
parted
with
conveniently
he
did
acknowledge
himself
to
be
a
humbled
man
more
so
than
he
had
ever
yet
done
or
had
been
like
to
do
while
conscious
of
the
loss
which
had
fallen
on
him
it
was
at
this
moment
when
he
began
to
perceive
that
his
fortune
would
return
to
him
when
he
became
aware
that
he
was
knocked
about
like
a
shuttlecock
from
a
battledore
that
his
pride
came
by
its
first
fall
mollett
was
in
truth
the
great
man
the
warwick
who
was
to
make
and
unmake
the
kings
of
castle
richmond
a
month
ago
and
it
had
pleased
earl
mollett
to
say
that
owen
fitzgerald
should
reign
but
there
had
been
a
turn
upon
the
cards
and
now
he
king
herbert
was
to
be
again
installed
he
walked
down
all
alone
through
james
street
and
by
pall
mall
and
charing
cross
feeling
rather
than
thinking
of
all
this
those
doubts
of
mr
die
did
not
trouble
him
much
he
fully
believed
that
he
should
regain
his
title
and
property
or
rather
that
he
should
never
lose
them
but
he
thought
that
he
could
never
show
himself
about
the
country
again
as
he
had
done
before
all
this
was
known
in
spite
of
his
good
fortune
he
was
sad
at
heart
little
conscious
of
the
good
that
all
this
would
do
him
he
went
on
by
the
horse
guards
and
treasury
chambers
into
parliament
street
and
so
up
to
the
new
houses
of
parliament
and
sauntered
into
westminster
hall
and
there
at
the
privileged
door
between
the
lamps
on
his
left
hand
he
saw
busy
men
going
in
and
out
some
slow
and
dignified
others
hot
hasty
and
anxious
and
he
felt
as
though
the
regions
to
and
from
which
they
passed
must
be
far
out
of
his
reach
could
he
aspire
to
pass
those
august
he
whose
very
name
depended
on
what
in
truth
might
have
been
the
early
doings
of
a
low
scoundrel
who
was
now
skulking
from
the
law
and
then
he
went
on
and
mounting
by
the
public
stairs
and
anterooms
found
his
way
to
the
lobby
of
the
house
there
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
stall
moody
and
melancholy
looking
on
as
men
in
the
crowd
pushed
forward
to
speak
to
members
whom
they
knew
or
as
it
sometimes
appeared
to
members
whom
they
did
not
know
there
was
somewhat
of
interest
going
on
in
the
house
for
the
throng
was
thick
and
ordinary
men
sometimes
jostled
themselves
on
into
the
middle
of
the
hall
with
impious
steps
for
on
those
centre
stones
none
but
legislators
should
presume
to
stand
stand
back
gentlemen
stand
back
back
a
little
if
you
please
sir
said
a
very
courteous
but
peremptory
policeman
so
moving
the
throng
that
herbert
who
had
been
behind
in
no
way
anxious
for
a
forward
place
or
for
distinguishing
nods
from
passing
members
found
himself
suddenly
in
the
front
rank
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
a
cluster
of
young
senators
who
were
cooling
themselves
in
the
lobby
after
the
ardour
of
the
debate
it
was
as
pretty
a
thing
as
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
said
one
and
beautifully
ridden
surely
it
must
have
been
the
spring
meeting
and
not
the
debate
that
they
were
discussing
i
do
know
much
about
that
said
another
and
the
voice
sounded
on
herbert
ears
as
it
might
almost
be
the
voice
of
a
brother
i
know
i
lost
the
odds
but
i
have
a
bottle
of
hallo
fitzgerald
why
and
then
the
young
member
stopped
himself
for
herbert
fitzgerald
story
was
rife
about
london
at
this
time
how
do
you
do
moulsey
said
herbert
very
glumly
for
he
did
not
at
all
like
being
recognized
this
was
lord
moulsey
the
eldest
son
of
the
earl
of
hampton
court
who
was
now
member
for
the
river
regions
and
had
been
one
of
herbert
most
intimate
friends
at
oxford
i
did
not
exactly
expect
to
see
you
here
said
lord
moulsey
drawing
him
apart
and
upon
my
soul
i
was
never
so
cut
up
in
my
life
as
when
i
heard
all
that
is
it
true
true
why
no
it
was
true
but
i
do
think
it
is
that
is
to
say
upon
my
word
i
do
know
it
all
unsettled
good
evening
to
you
and
again
nodding
his
head
at
his
old
friend
in
a
very
sombre
manner
he
skulked
off
and
made
his
way
out
of
westminster
hall
do
you
know
who
that
was
said
lord
moulsey
going
back
to
his
ally
that
was
young
fitzgerald
the
poor
fellow
who
has
been
done
out
of
his
title
and
all
his
property
you
have
heard
about
his
mother
have
you
was
that
young
fitzgerald
said
the
other
senator
apparently
more
interested
in
this
subject
than
he
had
even
been
about
the
pretty
riding
i
wish
i
looked
at
him
poor
fellow
how
does
he
bear
it
upon
my
word
then
i
never
saw
a
fellow
so
changed
in
my
life
he
and
i
were
like
brothers
but
he
would
hardly
speak
to
me
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
written
to
him
but
he
says
it
not
settled
oh
that
all
gammon
it
settled
enough
why
they
given
up
the
place
i
heard
all
about
it
the
other
day
from
sullivan
they
are
not
even
making
any
fight
sullivan
says
they
are
the
greatest
fools
in
the
world
upon
my
word
i
think
young
fitzgerald
was
mad
just
now
his
manner
was
so
very
odd
i
should
wonder
i
know
i
should
go
mad
if
my
mother
turned
out
to
be
somebody
else
wife
and
then
they
both
sauntered
away
herbert
was
doubly
angry
with
himself
as
he
made
his
way
down
into
the
noble
old
hall
angry
that
he
had
gone
where
there
was
a
possibility
of
his
being
recognized
and
angry
also
that
he
had
behaved
himself
with
so
little
presence
of
mind
when
he
was
recognized
he
felt
that
he
had
been
taken
aback
that
he
had
been
beside
himself
and
unable
to
maintain
his
own
dignity
he
had
run
away
from
his
old
intimate
friend
because
he
had
been
unable
to
bear
being
looked
on
as
the
hero
of
a
family
tragedy
he
would
go
back
to
ireland
he
said
to
himself
and
he
would
never
leave
it
again
perhaps
he
might
teach
himself
there
to
endure
the
eyes
and
voices
of
men
around
him
nothing
at
any
rate
should
induce
him
to
come
again
to
london
and
so
he
went
home
to
bed
in
a
mood
by
no
means
so
happy
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
result
of
the
day
doings
and
yet
he
had
been
cheerful
enough
when
he
went
to
mr
die
chambers
in
the
morning
chapter
xlii
another
journey
on
the
following
day
he
did
go
back
to
ireland
stopping
a
night
in
dublin
on
the
road
so
that
his
mother
might
receive
his
letter
and
that
his
cousin
and
somers
might
receive
those
written
by
prendergast
he
spent
one
night
in
dublin
and
then
went
on
so
that
he
might
arrive
at
castle
richmond
after
dark
in
his
present
mood
he
dreaded
to
be
seen
returning
even
by
his
own
people
about
the
place
at
buttevant
he
was
met
by
his
own
car
and
by
richard
as
he
had
desired
but
he
found
that
he
was
utterly
frustrated
as
to
that
method
of
seating
himself
in
his
vehicle
which
he
had
promised
to
himself
he
was
still
glum
and
gloomy
enough
when
the
coach
stopped
for
he
had
been
all
alone
thinking
over
many
things
thinking
of
his
father
death
and
his
mother
early
life
of
all
that
he
had
suffered
and
might
yet
have
to
suffer
and
above
all
things
dreading
the
consciousness
that
men
were
talking
of
him
and
staring
at
him
in
this
mood
he
was
preparing
to
leave
the
coach
when
he
found
himself
approaching
near
to
that
buttevant
stage
but
he
had
more
to
go
through
at
present
than
he
expected
there
his
honour
hurrah
god
bless
his
sweet
face
that
come
among
us
agin
this
day
hurrah
for
sir
herbert
boys
hurrah
the
rail
ould
fitzgerald
be
back
agin
among
us
glory
be
to
god
and
the
blessed
virgin
hurrah
for
sir
herbert
and
then
there
was
a
shout
that
seemed
to
be
repeated
all
down
the
street
of
buttevant
but
that
was
nothing
to
what
was
coming
herbert
when
he
first
heard
this
retreated
for
a
moment
back
into
the
coach
but
there
was
little
use
in
that
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
descend
and
had
he
not
done
so
he
would
have
been
dragged
out
he
put
his
foot
on
the
steps
and
then
found
himself
seized
in
the
arms
of
a
man
outside
and
pressed
and
embraced
as
though
he
had
been
a
baby
ugh
ugh
ugh
exclaimed
a
voice
the
owner
of
which
intended
to
send
forth
notes
of
joy
but
so
overcome
was
he
by
the
intensity
of
his
own
feelings
that
he
was
in
nowise
able
to
moderate
his
voice
either
for
joy
or
sorrow
ugh
ugh
ugh
eh
sir
herbert
but
it
i
that
am
proud
to
see
yer
honour
this
day
wid
yer
ouwn

oh

oh

and
i
knew
the
niver

that
way
and
let
the
warld

intirely
wrong
like
that
for

as
you
are
the
lord

hould
a
foot

castle
richmond
and
that
god
ouwn
thruth
and
that
thrue
for
you
richard
said
another
whom
herbert
in
the
confusion
could
not
recognize
though
his
voice
was
familiar
to
him
and
the
boys
had
it
all
made
out
but
what
matthers
now
sir
herbert
back
and
god
bless
the
day
and
the
hour
that
he
came
to
us
and
then
leaving
his
master
arm
and
coat
to
which
he
had
still
stuck
he
began
to
busy
himself
loudly
about
the
travelling
gear
coachman
where
sir
herbert
portmantel
yes
that
sir
herbert
an
i
ought
to
know
it
well
and
the
black
bag
yes
be
sir
herbert
to
be
sure
and
so
on
nor
was
this
all
the
name
seemed
to
run
like
wildfire
through
all
the
buttevantians
there
assembled
and
no
sound
seemed
to
reach
our
hero
name
but
that
of
sir
herbert
sir
herbert
everybody
took
hold
of
him
and
kissed
his
hand
and
pulled
his
skirts
and
stroked
his
face
his
hat
was
knocked
off
and
put
on
again
amid
thousands
of
blessings
it
was
nearly
dark
and
his
eyes
were
dazed
by
the
coach
lanterns
which
were
carried
about
so
that
he
could
hardly
see
his
friends
but
the
one
sound
which
was
dinned
into
his
ears
was
that
of
sir
herbert
sir
herbert
had
he
thought
about
it
when
starting
from
dublin
early
that
morning
he
would
have
said
that
it
would
have
killed
him
to
have
heard
himself
so
greeted
in
the
public
street
but
as
it
was
he
found
that
he
got
over
it
very
easily
before
he
was
well
seated
on
his
car
it
may
be
questioned
whether
he
was
not
so
used
to
his
name
that
he
would
have
been
startled
to
hear
himself
designated
as
fitzgerald
for
half
a
minute
he
had
been
wretched
and
had
felt
a
disgust
at
poor
richard
which
he
thought
at
the
moment
would
be
insuperable
but
when
he
was
on
the
car
and
the
poor
fellow
came
round
to
tuck
the
apron
in
under
his
feet
he
could
not
help
giving
him
his
hand
and
fraternizing
with
him
and
how
is
my
mother
richard
then
sir
herbert
me
lady
is
surprising
very
but
her
leddyship
was
always
that
and
as
sweet
to
them
as
comes
nigh
her
as
flowers
in
may
but
sure
that
nathural
to
her
leddyship
and
richard
yes

herbert

owen
over
at
castle
richmond
since

herbert

richmond
and
that
only
yer

come
back
to
yer

and
why

herbert
that

footsteps
of

yer
born
fool
sir
herbert
says
ye
to
get
up
he
would
come
over
sir
herbert
just
to
say
he
been
the
first
to
see
yer
honour
god
bless
yer
honour
sir
herbert
exclaimed
the
poor
fellow
out
of
breath
as
he
took
his
seat
it
was
his
voice
that
sir
herbert
had
recognized
among
the
crowd
angry
enough
at
that
moment
but
in
future
days
it
was
remembered
in
larry
carson
favour
that
he
had
come
over
to
castle
richmond
to
see
his
master
contented
to
run
the
whole
road
back
to
castle
richmond
behind
the
car
a
better
fate
however
was
his
for
he
made
one
in
the
triumphal
entry
up
the
avenue
when
they
got
to
the
lodge
it
was
quite
dark
so
dark
that
even
richard
who
was
experienced
in
declared
that
a
cat
could
not
see
however
they
turned
in
at
the
great
gates
without
any
accident
the
accustomed
woman
coming
out
to
open
them
an
is
his
honour
there
thin
said
the
woman
and
may
god
bless
you
sir
herbert
and
ye
welcome
back
to
yer
own
so
ye
are
and
then
a
warm
large
hand
was
laid
upon
his
leg
and
a
warm
voice
sounded
greeting
in
his
ear
herbert
my
boy
how
are
you
this
is
well
is
it
not
it
was
somers
who
had
been
waiting
there
for
him
at
the
lodge
gate
upon
the
whole
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
to
himself
that
it
was
well
somers
got
up
beside
him
on
the
car
so
that
by
this
time
it
was
well
laden
and
how
does
my
mother
take
it
herbert
asked
very
quietly
your
aunt
letty
told
me
that
she
had
spent
most
of
her
time
in
prayer
since
she
heard
it
but
miss
letty
seems
to
think
that
on
your
account
she
is
very
full
of
joy
and
the
girls
oh
the
girls
what
girls
well
they
must
answer
for
themselves
i
left
them
about
half
an
hour
ago
and
now
you
hear
their
voices
in
the
porch
he
did
hear
the
voices
in
the
porch
plainly
though
he
could
not
distinguish
them
as
the
horse
feet
and
the
car
wheels
rattled
over
the
gravel
but
as
the
car
stopped
at
the
door
with
somewhat
of
a
crash
he
heard
emmeline
say
there
herbert
and
then
as
he
got
down
they
all
retreated
in
among
the
lights
in
the
hall
god
bless
your
honour
sir
herbert
an
it
you
that
are
welcome
back
this
blessed
night
to
castle
richmond
such
and
such
like
were
the
greetings
which
met
him
from
twenty
different
voices
as
he
essayed
to
enter
the
house
every
servant
and
groom
about
the
place
was
there
and
some
few
of
the
nearest
tenants
of
those
who
had
lived
near
enough
to
hear
the
glad
tidings
since
the
morning
a
dozen
at
any
rate
took
his
hands
as
he
strove
to
make
his
way
through
them
and
though
he
was
never
quite
sure
about
it
he
believed
that
one
or
two
had
kissed
him
in
the
dark
at
last
he
found
himself
in
the
hall
and
even
then
the
first
person
who
got
hold
of
him
was
jones
and
so
you
come
back
to
us
after
all
herbert
sir
herbert
i
should
say
begging
your
pardon
sir
and
it
all
right
about
my
lady
i
never
thought
to
be
so
happy
again
never
never
never
and
then
she
retreated
with
her
apron
up
to
her
eyes
leaving
him
in
the
arms
of
aunt
letty
the
lord
giveth
and
the
lord
taketh
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
oh
herbert
my
darling
boy
i
hope
this
may
be
a
lesson
and
a
warning
to
you
so
that
you
may
flee
from
the
wrath
to
come
aunt
letty
had
time
been
allowed
to
her
would
certainly
have
shown
that
the
evil
had
all
come
from
tampering
with
papistical
abominations
and
that
the
returning
prosperity
of
the
house
of
castle
richmond
was
due
to
protestant
energy
and
truth
but
much
time
was
not
allowed
to
aunt
letty
as
herbert
hurried
on
after
his
sisters
as
he
had
advanced
they
had
retreated
and
now
he
heard
them
in
the
he
began
to
be
conscious
that
they
were
not
alone
that
they
had
some
visitor
with
them
and
began
to
be
conscious
also
who
that
visitor
was
and
when
he
got
himself
at
last
into
the
room
sure
enough
there
were
three
girls
there
two
running
forward
to
meet
him
from
the
fireplace
to
which
they
had
retreated
and
the
other
lingering
a
little
in
their
rear
oh
herbert
and
oh
herbert
and
then
their
arms
were
thrown
about
his
neck
and
their
warm
kisses
were
on
his
cheeks
kisses
not
unmixed
with
tears
for
of
course
they
began
to
cry
immediately
that
he
was
with
them
though
their
eyes
had
been
dry
enough
for
the
two
or
three
hours
before
their
arms
were
about
his
neck
and
their
kisses
on
his
cheeks
i
have
said
meaning
thereby
the
arms
and
kisses
of
his
sisters
for
the
third
young
lady
still
lingered
a
little
in
the
rear
was
it
not
lucky
clara
was
here
when
the
news
came
to
us
this
morning
said
mary
such
difficulty
as
we
have
had
to
get
her
said
emmeline
it
was
to
have
been
her
farewell
visit
to
us
but
we
will
have
no
more
farewells
now
will
we
clara
and
now
at
last
he
had
his
arm
round
her
waist
or
as
near
to
that
position
as
he
was
destined
to
get
it
on
the
present
occasion
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
let
him
hold
that
fast
and
smiled
on
him
through
her
soft
tears
and
was
gracious
to
him
with
her
sweet
words
and
pleasant
looks
but
she
would
not
come
forward
and
kiss
him
boldly
as
she
had
done
when
last
they
had
met
at
desmond
court
he
attempted
it
now
but
he
could
get
his
lips
no
nearer
to
hers
than
her
forehead
and
when
he
tried
to
hold
her
she
slipped
away
from
him
and
he
continually
found
himself
in
the
embraces
of
his
sisters
which
was
not
the
same
thing
at
all
never
mind
he
said
to
himself
his
day
would
soon
come
round
you
did
not
expect
to
find
clara
here
did
you
asked
emmeline
i
hardly
know
what
i
have
expected
or
not
expected
for
the
last
two
days
no
certainly
i
had
no
hope
of
seeing
her
i
trust
i
am
not
in
the
way
said
clara
whereupon
he
made
another
attempt
with
his
arm
but
when
he
thought
he
had
caught
his
prize
emmeline
was
again
within
his
grasp
and
my
mother
he
then
said
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
had
only
yet
been
in
the
room
for
three
minutes
though
his
little
efforts
have
taken
longer
than
that
in
the
telling
she
is
up
stairs
and
you
are
to
go
to
her
but
i
told
her
that
we
should
keep
you
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
you
have
not
been
here
half
that
time
yet
and
how
has
she
borne
all
this
why
well
on
the
whole
when
first
she
heard
it
this
morning
which
she
did
before
any
of
us
you
know
oh
yes
i
wrote
to
her
but
your
letter
told
her
nothing
somers
came
down
almost
as
soon
as
your
letter
was
here
he
had
heard
also
from
prendergast
i
think
it
was
and
prendergast
said
a
great
deal
more
than
you
did
well
we
thought
she
was
going
to
be
ill
at
first
for
she
became
so
very
pale
flushing
up
sometimes
for
half
a
minute
or
so
but
after
an
hour
or
two
she
became
quite
calm
she
has
seen
nobody
since
but
us
and
aunt
letty
she
saw
me
said
clara
oh
yes
you
you
are
one
of
us
now
just
the
same
as
ourselves
is
she
herbert
not
exactly
the
same
herbert
thought
and
then
he
went
up
stairs
to
his
mother
this
interview
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
lady
fitzgerald
had
become
a
stricken
woman
from
the
first
moment
that
she
had
heard
that
that
man
had
returned
to
life
who
in
her
early
girlhood
had
come
to
her
as
a
suitor
nay
this
had
been
so
from
the
first
moment
that
she
had
expected
his
return
and
these
misfortunes
had
come
upon
her
so
quickly
that
though
they
had
not
shattered
her
in
body
and
mind
as
they
had
shattered
her
husband
nevertheless
they
had
told
terribly
on
her
heart
the
coming
of
those
men
the
agony
of
sir
thomas
the
telling
of
the
story
as
it
had
been
told
to
her
by
prendergast
the
resolve
to
abandon
everything
even
a
name
by
which
she
might
be
called
as
far
as
she
herself
was
concerned
the
death
of
her
husband
and
then
the
departure
of
her
ruined
son
had
one
may
say
been
enough
to
destroy
the
spirit
of
any
woman
her
spirit
they
had
not
utterly
destroyed
her
powers
of
endurance
were
great
and
she
had
endured
still
hoping
but
as
the
uttermost
malice
of
adversity
had
not
been
able
altogether
to
depress
her
so
neither
did
returning
prosperity
exalt
her
as
far
as
she
herself
was
concerned
she
rejoiced
for
her
children
greatly
thanking
god
that
she
had
not
entailed
on
them
an
existence
without
a
name
but
for
herself
as
she
now
told
herbert
outside
life
was
all
over
her
children
and
the
poor
she
might
still
have
with
her
but
beyond
nothing
in
this
world
to
them
would
be
confined
all
her
wishes
on
this
side
the
grave
but
nevertheless
she
could
be
warm
in
her
greetings
to
her
son
she
could
understand
that
though
she
were
dead
to
the
world
he
need
not
be
so
nor
indeed
ought
to
be
so
things
that
were
now
all
ending
with
her
were
but
beginning
with
him
she
had
no
feeling
that
taught
her
to
think
that
it
was
bad
for
him
to
be
a
man
of
rank
and
fortune
the
head
of
his
family
and
the
privileged
one
of
his
race
it
had
been
perhaps
her
greatest
misery
that
she
by
her
doing
had
placed
him
in
the
terrible
position
which
he
had
lately
been
called
upon
to
fill
dearest
mother
it
did
not
make
me
unhappy
he
said
caressing
her
you
bore
it
like
a
man
herbert
as
i
shall
ever
remember
but
it
did
make
me
unhappy
more
unhappy
than
it
should
have
done
when
we
remember
how
very
short
is
our
time
here
below
he
remained
with
his
mother
for
more
than
an
hour
and
then
returned
to
the
where
the
girls
were
waiting
for
him
with
the
arranged
before
them
i
was
very
nearly
coming
up
to
fetch
you
said
mary
only
that
we
knew
how
much
mamma
must
have
to
say
to
you
we
dined
early
because
we
are
all
so
upset
said
emmeline
and
clara
must
be
dying
for
her
tea
and
why
should
clara
die
for
tea
any
more
than
any
one
else
asked
lady
clara
herself
i
will
not
venture
to
say
what
hour
it
was
before
they
separated
for
bed
they
sat
there
with
their
feet
over
the
fender
talking
about
things
gone
and
things
coming
and
there
were
so
many
of
such
things
for
them
to
discuss
even
yet
as
one
of
the
girls
remarked
lady
desmond
had
not
heard
of
the
last
change
or
if
she
had
so
heard
had
had
no
time
to
communicate
with
her
daughter
upon
the
subject
and
then
owen
was
spoken
of
with
the
warmest
praise
by
them
all
and
clara
explained
openly
what
had
been
the
full
tenor
of
his
intended
conduct
that
would
have
been
impossible
said
herbert
but
it
was
not
the
less
noble
in
him
was
it
said
clara
eagerly
but
she
did
not
tell
how
owen
fitzgerald
had
prayed
that
her
love
might
be
given
back
to
him
as
his
reward
for
what
he
wished
to
do
on
behalf
of
his
cousin
now
at
least
at
this
moment
it
was
not
told
yet
the
day
did
come
when
all
that
was
described
a
day
when
owen
in
his
absence
was
regarded
by
them
both
among
the
dearest
of
their
friends
but
even
on
that
night
clara
resolved
that
he
should
have
some
meed
of
praise
has
he
not
been
noble
she
said
appealing
to
him
who
was
to
be
her
husband
has
he
not
been
very
noble
herbert
too
happy
to
be
jealous
acknowledged
that
it
was
so
chapter
xliii
playing
rounders
my
story
is
nearly
at
its
close
and
all
readers
will
now
know
how
it
is
to
end
those
difficulties
raised
by
mr
die
were
all
made
to
vanish
and
though
he
implored
prendergast
over
and
over
again
to
go
about
this
business
with
a
moderated
eagerness
that
gentleman
would
not
consent
to
let
any
grass
grow
under
his
heels
till
he
had
made
assurance
doubly
sure
and
had
seen
herbert
fitzgerald
firmly
seated
on
his
throne
all
that
the
women
in
spinny
lane
had
told
him
was
quite
true
the
register
was
found
in
the
archives
of
the
parish
of
putney
and
prendergast
was
able
to
prove
that
matthew
mollett
now
of
spinny
lane
and
the
matthew
mollett
then
designated
as
of
newmarket
in
cambridgeshire
were
one
and
the
same
person
therefore
mollett
marriage
with
miss
wainwright
was
no
marriage
and
therefore
also
the
marriage
between
sir
thomas
fitzgerald
and
that
lady
was
a
true
marriage
all
which
things
will
now
be
plain
to
any
capacity
mean
as
such
capacity
may
be
in
respect
to
legal
law
and
i
have
only
further
to
tell
in
respect
to
this
part
of
my
story
that
the
molletts
both
father
and
son
escaped
all
punishment
for
the
frauds
and
villanies
related
in
these
pages
except
such
punishment
as
these
frauds
and
villanies
acting
by
their
own
innate
destructive
forces
and
poisons
brought
down
upon
their
unfortunate
heads
for
so
allowing
them
to
escape
i
shall
be
held
by
many
to
have
been
deficient
in
sound
teaching
what
men
will
say
not
punish
your
evil
principle
allow
the
prevailing
evil
genius
of
your
book
to
escape
scot
free
without
administering
any
of
that
condign
punishment
which
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
you
to
allot
to
them
had
you
not
treadmills
to
your
hand
and
all
manner
of
new
prison
disciplines
should
not
matthew
have
repented
in
the
sackcloth
of
solitary
confinement
and
aby
have
munched
and
crunched
between
his
teeth
the
bitter
ashes
of
prison
bread
and
water
nay
for
such
offences
as
those
did
you
wot
of
no
penal
settlements
were
not
portland
and
spike
islands
gaping
for
them
had
you
no
memory
of
dartmoor
and
the
bermudas
gentle
readers
no
not
in
this
instance
shall
spike
island
or
the
bermudas
be
asked
to
give
us
their
assistance
there
is
a
sackcloth
harsher
to
the
skin
than
that
of
the
penal
settlement
and
ashes
more
bitter
in
the
crunching
than
convict
rations
it
would
be
sad
indeed
if
we
thought
that
those
rascals
who
escape
the
law
escape
also
the
just
reward
of
their
rascality
may
it
not
rather
be
believed
that
the
whole
life
of
the
professional
rascal
is
one
long
wretched
punishment
to
which
if
he
could
but
know
it
the
rations
and
comparative
innocence
of
bermuda
would
be
so
preferable
is
he
not
always
rolling
the
stone
of
sysiphus
gyrating
on
the
wheel
of
ixion
hankering
after
the
waters
of
tantalus
filling
the
sieves
of
the
daughters
of
dana√ºs
he
pours
into
his
sieve
stolen
corn
beyond
measure
but
no
grain
will
stay
there
he
lifts
to
his
lips
rich
cups
but
rhadamanthus
the
policeman
allows
him
no
moment
for
a
draught
the
wheel
of
justice
is
ever
going
while
his
poor
hanging
head
is
in
a
whirl
the
stone
which
he
rolls
never
perches
for
a
moment
at
the
top
of
the
hill
for
the
trade
which
he
follows
admits
of
no
rest
have
i
not
said
truly
that
he
is
hunted
like
a
fox
driven
from
covert
to
covert
with
his
poor
empty
craving
belly
prowling
about
through
the
wet
night
he
returns
with
his
prey
and
finds
that
he
is
shut
out
from
his
lair
his
bloodshot
eye
is
ever
over
his
shoulder
and
his
advanced
foot
is
ever
ready
for
a
start
he
stinks
in
the
nostrils
of
the
hounds
of
the
law
and
is
held
by
all
men
to
be
vermin
one
would
say
that
the
rascal
if
he
but
knew
the
truth
would
look
forward
to
spike
island
and
the
bermudas
with
impatience
and
raptures
the
cold
hungry
friendless
solitary
doom
of
unconvicted
rascaldom
has
ever
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
most
wretched
phase
of
human
existence
that
phase
of
living
in
which
the
liver
can
trust
no
one
and
be
trusted
by
none
in
which
the
heart
is
ever
quailing
at
the
policeman
hat
and
the
eye
ever
shrinking
from
the
policeman
gaze
the
convict
does
trust
his
gaoler
at
any
rate
his
master
gaoler
and
in
so
doing
is
not
all
wretched
it
is
bill
sikes
before
conviction
that
i
have
ever
pitied
any
man
can
endure
to
be
hanged
but
how
can
any
man
have
taken
that
bill
sikes
walk
and
have
lived
through
it
to
such
punishments
will
we
leave
the
molletts
hoping
of
the
elder
one
that
under
the
care
of
those
ministering
angels
in
spinny
lane
his
heart
may
yet
be
softened
hoping
also
for
the
younger
one
that
some
ministering
angel
may
be
appointed
also
for
his
aid
is
a
grievous
piece
of
work
though
that
of
a
ministering
angel
to
such
a
soul
as
his
and
now
having
seen
them
so
far
on
their
mortal
career
we
will
take
our
leave
of
both
of
them
prendergast
object
in
sparing
them
was
of
course
that
of
saving
lady
fitzgerald
from
the
terrible
pain
of
having
her
name
brought
forward
at
any
trial
she
never
spoke
of
this
even
to
herbert
allowing
those
in
whom
she
trusted
to
manage
those
things
for
her
without
an
expression
of
anxiety
on
her
own
part
but
she
was
not
the
less
thankful
when
she
found
that
no
public
notice
was
to
be
taken
of
the
matter
very
shortly
after
herbert
return
to
castle
richmond
it
was
notified
to
him
that
he
need
have
no
fear
as
to
his
inheritance
and
it
was
so
notified
with
the
great
additional
comfort
of
an
assuring
opinion
from
mr
die
he
then
openly
called
himself
sir
herbert
took
upon
himself
the
property
which
became
his
by
right
of
the
entail
and
issued
orders
for
the
preparation
of
his
marriage
settlement
during
this
period
he
saw
owen
fitzgerald
but
he
did
so
in
the
presence
of
somers
and
not
a
word
was
then
said
about
lady
clara
desmond
both
the
gentlemen
herbert
and
somers
cordially
thanked
the
master
of
hap
house
for
the
way
in
which
he
had
behaved
to
the
castle
richmond
family
and
in
reference
to
the
castle
richmond
property
during
the
terrible
events
of
the
last
two
months
but
owen
took
their
thanks
somewhat
haughtily
he
shook
hands
warmly
enough
with
his
cousin
wishing
him
joy
on
the
arrangement
of
his
affairs
and
was
at
first
less
distant
than
usual
with
somers
but
when
they
alluded
to
his
own
conduct
and
expressed
their
gratitude
he
declared
that
he
had
done
nothing
for
which
thanks
were
due
and
that
he
begged
it
to
be
understood
that
he
laid
claim
to
no
gratitude
had
he
acted
otherwise
he
said
he
would
have
deserved
to
be
kicked
out
of
the
presence
of
all
honest
men
and
to
be
thanked
for
the
ordinary
conduct
of
a
gentleman
was
almost
an
insult
this
he
said
looking
chiefly
at
somers
and
then
turning
to
his
cousin
he
asked
him
if
he
intended
to
remain
in
the
country
oh
certainly
said
herbert
i
shall
not
said
owen
and
if
you
know
any
one
who
will
take
a
lease
of
hap
house
for
ten
or
twelve
years
i
shall
be
glad
to
find
a
tenant
and
you
where
are
you
going
to
africa
in
the
first
instance
said
he
there
seems
to
be
some
good
hunting
there
and
i
think
that
i
shall
try
it
the
new
tidings
were
not
long
in
reaching
desmond
court
and
the
countess
was
all
alone
when
she
first
heard
them
with
very
great
difficulty
taking
as
it
were
the
bit
between
her
teeth
clara
had
managed
to
get
over
to
castle
richmond
that
she
might
pay
a
last
visit
to
the
fitzgerald
girls
at
this
time
lady
desmond
mind
was
in
a
terribly
distracted
state
the
rumour
was
rife
about
the
country
that
owen
had
refused
to
accept
the
property
and
the
countess
herself
had
of
course
been
made
aware
that
he
had
so
refused
but
she
was
too
keenly
awake
to
the
affairs
of
the
world
to
suppose
that
such
a
refusal
could
continue
long
in
force
neither
as
she
knew
well
could
herbert
accept
of
that
which
was
offered
to
him
it
might
be
that
for
some
years
to
come
the
property
might
be
unenjoyed
the
rich
fruit
might
fall
rotten
from
the
wall
but
what
would
that
avail
to
her
or
to
her
child
herbert
would
still
be
a
nameless
man
and
could
never
be
master
of
castle
richmond
nevertheless
clara
carried
her
point
and
went
over
to
her
friends
leaving
the
countess
all
alone
she
had
now
permitted
her
son
to
return
to
eton
finding
that
he
was
powerless
to
aid
her
the
young
earl
was
quite
willing
that
his
sister
should
marry
owen
fitzgerald
but
he
was
not
willing
to
use
any
power
of
persuasion
that
he
might
have
in
what
his
mother
considered
a
useful
or
legitimate
manner
he
talked
of
rewarding
owen
for
his
generosity
but
clara
would
have
nothing
to
do
either
with
the
generosity
or
with
the
reward
and
so
lady
desmond
was
left
alone
hearing
that
even
owen
owen
himself
had
now
given
up
the
quest
and
feeling
that
it
was
useless
to
have
any
further
hope
she
will
make
her
own
bed
the
countess
said
to
herself
and
she
must
lie
on
it
and
then
came
this
rumour
that
after
all
herbert
was
to
be
the
man
it
first
reached
her
ears
about
the
same
time
that
herbert
arrived
at
his
own
house
but
it
did
so
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
but
little
impression
at
the
moment
lady
desmond
had
but
few
gossips
and
in
a
general
way
heard
but
little
of
what
was
doing
in
the
country
on
this
occasion
the
caleb
balderston
of
her
house
came
in
making
stately
bows
to
his
mistress
and
with
low
voice
and
eyes
wide
open
told
her
what
a
gossoon
running
over
from
castle
richmond
had
reported
in
the
kitchen
of
desmond
court
at
any
rate
my
lady
herbert
is
expected
this
evening
at
the
house
and
then
caleb
balderston
bowing
stately
again
left
the
room
this
did
not
make
much
impression
but
it
made
some
and
then
on
the
following
day
clara
wrote
to
her
this
she
did
after
deep
consideration
and
much
consultation
with
her
friends
it
would
be
unkind
they
argued
to
leave
lady
desmond
in
ignorance
on
such
a
subject
and
therefore
a
note
was
written
very
guardedly
the
joint
production
of
the
three
in
which
with
the
expression
of
many
doubts
it
was
told
that
perhaps
after
all
herbert
might
yet
be
the
man
but
even
then
the
countess
did
not
believe
it
but
during
the
next
week
the
rumour
became
a
fact
through
the
country
and
everybody
knew
even
the
countess
of
desmond
that
all
that
family
history
was
again
changed
lady
fitzgerald
whom
they
had
all
known
was
lady
fitzgerald
still
and
herbert
was
once
more
on
his
throne
when
rumours
thus
became
a
fact
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
about
the
matter
the
countryside
did
not
say
that
perhaps
after
all
so
and
so
would
go
in
such
and
such
a
way
or
that
legal
doubts
having
been
entertained
the
gentlemen
of
the
long
robe
were
about
to
do
this
and
that
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
the
affair
was
as
surely
settled
in
county
cork
as
though
the
line
of
the
fitzgeralds
had
never
been
disturbed
and
sir
herbert
was
fully
seated
on
his
throne
it
was
well
then
for
poor
owen
that
he
had
never
assumed
the
regalia
of
royalty
had
he
done
so
his
fall
would
have
been
very
dreadful
as
it
was
not
only
were
all
those
pangs
spared
to
him
but
he
achieved
at
once
an
immense
popularity
through
the
whole
country
everybody
called
him
poor
owen
and
declared
how
well
he
had
behaved
some
expressed
almost
a
regret
that
his
generosity
should
go
unrewarded
and
others
went
so
far
as
to
give
him
his
reward
he
was
to
marry
emmeline
fitzgerald
they
said
at
the
clubs
in
cork
and
a
considerable
slice
of
the
property
was
destined
to
give
additional
charms
to
the
young
lady
hand
and
heart
for
a
month
or
so
owen
fitzgerald
was
the
most
popular
man
in
the
south
of
ireland
that
is
as
far
as
a
man
can
be
popular
who
never
shows
himself
and
the
countess
had
to
answer
her
daughter
letter
if
this
be
so
she
said
of
course
i
shall
be
well
pleased
my
anxiety
has
been
only
for
your
welfare
to
further
which
i
have
been
willing
to
make
any
possible
sacrifice
clara
when
she
read
this
did
not
know
what
sacrifice
had
been
made
nor
had
the
countess
thought
as
she
wrote
the
words
what
had
been
the
sacrifice
to
which
she
had
thus
alluded
though
her
heart
was
ever
conscious
of
it
unconsciously
and
the
countess
sent
her
love
to
them
all
at
castle
richmond
she
did
not
fear
she
said
that
they
would
misinterpret
her
lady
fitzgerald
she
was
sure
would
perfectly
understand
that
she
had
endeavoured
to
do
her
duty
by
her
child
it
was
by
no
means
a
bad
letter
and
which
was
better
was
in
the
main
a
true
letter
according
to
her
light
she
had
striven
to
do
her
duty
and
her
conduct
was
not
misjudged
at
any
rate
at
castle
richmond
you
must
not
think
harshly
of
mamma
said
clara
to
her
future
oh
no
said
lady
fitzgerald
i
certainly
do
not
think
harshly
of
her
in
her
position
i
should
probably
have
acted
as
she
has
done
the
difference
however
between
them
was
this
that
it
was
all
but
impossible
that
lady
fitzgerald
should
not
sympathize
with
her
children
while
it
was
almost
impossible
that
the
countess
of
desmond
should
do
so
and
so
lady
desmond
remained
all
alone
at
desmond
court
brooding
over
the
things
as
they
now
were
for
the
present
it
was
better
that
clara
should
remain
at
castle
richmond
and
nothing
therefore
was
said
of
her
return
on
either
side
she
could
not
add
to
her
comfort
at
home
and
why
should
she
not
remain
happy
where
she
was
she
was
already
a
fitzgerald
in
heart
rather
than
a
desmond
and
was
it
not
well
that
she
should
be
so
if
she
could
love
herbert
fitzgerald
that
was
well
also
since
the
day
on
which
he
had
appeared
at
desmond
court
wet
and
dirty
and
wretched
with
a
broken
spirit
and
fortunes
as
draggled
as
his
dress
he
had
lost
all
claim
to
be
a
hero
in
the
estimation
of
lady
desmond
to
her
those
only
were
heroes
whose
pride
and
spirit
were
never
draggled
and
such
a
hero
there
still
was
in
her
close
neighbourhood
lady
desmond
herself
was
a
woman
of
a
mercenary
spirit
so
at
least
it
will
be
said
and
thought
of
her
but
she
was
not
altogether
so
although
the
two
facts
were
strong
against
her
that
she
had
sold
herself
for
a
title
and
had
been
willing
to
sell
her
daughter
for
a
fortune
poverty
she
herself
had
endured
upon
the
whole
with
patience
and
though
she
hated
and
scorned
it
from
her
very
soul
she
would
now
have
given
herself
in
marriage
to
a
poor
man
without
rank
or
station
she
a
countess
and
the
mother
of
an
earl
and
that
she
would
have
done
with
all
the
romantic
love
of
a
girl
of
sixteen
though
she
was
now
a
woman
verging
upon
forty
men
and
women
only
know
so
much
of
themselves
and
others
as
circumstances
and
their
destiny
have
allowed
to
appear
had
it
perchance
fallen
to
thy
lot
o
my
forensic
friend
heavy
laden
with
the
wisdom
of
the
law
to
write
tales
such
as
this
of
mine
how
charmingly
might
not
thy
characters
have
come
forth
upon
the
canvas
how
much
more
charmingly
than
i
can
limn
them
while
on
the
other
hand
ignorant
as
thou
now
tellest
me
that
i
am
of
the
very
alphabet
of
the
courts
had
thy
wig
been
allotted
to
me
i
might
have
gathered
guineas
thick
as
daisies
in
summer
while
to
thee
perhaps
they
come
no
faster
than
in
the
early
spring
it
is
all
in
our
destiny
chance
had
thrown
that
terrible
earl
in
the
way
of
the
poor
girl
in
her
early
youth
and
she
had
married
him
she
had
married
him
and
all
idea
of
love
had
flown
from
her
heart
all
idea
of
love
but
not
all
the
capacity
as
now
within
this
last
year
or
two
she
had
learned
so
much
to
her
cost
long
months
had
passed
since
she
had
first
owned
this
to
herself
since
she
had
dared
to
tell
herself
that
it
was
possible
even
for
her
to
begin
the
world
again
and
to
play
the
game
which
women
love
to
play
once
at
least
before
they
die
she
could
have
worshipped
this
man
and
sat
at
his
feet
and
endowed
him
in
her
heart
with
heroism
and
given
him
her
soft
brown
hair
to
play
with
when
it
suited
her
hercules
to
rest
from
his
labours
she
could
have
forgotten
her
years
and
have
forgotten
too
the
children
who
had
now
grown
up
to
seize
the
world
from
beneath
her
feet
to
seize
it
before
she
herself
had
enjoyed
it
she
could
have
forgotten
all
that
was
past
and
have
been
every
whit
as
young
as
her
own
daughter
if
only
it
is
so
i
believe
with
most
of
us
who
have
begun
to
turn
the
hill
i
myself
could
go
on
to
that
common
that
is
at
this
moment
before
me
and
join
that
game
of
rounders
with
the
most
intense
delight
by
george
you
fellow
you
no
eyes
did
you
see
that
he
put
his
foot
in
the
hole
he
get
back
now
that
chap
and
your
side
is
done
for
the
next
but
then
they
would
all
be
awestruck
for
a
while
and
after
that
when
they
grew
to
be
familiar
with
me
they
would
laugh
at
me
because
i
loomed
large
in
my
running
and
returned
to
my
ground
scant
of
breath
alas
alas
i
know
that
it
would
not
do
so
i
pass
by
imperious
in
my
heavy
manhood
and
one
of
the
lads
respectfully
abstains
from
me
though
the
ball
is
under
my
very
feet
but
then
i
have
had
my
game
of
rounders
no
horrible
old
earl
with
gloating
eyes
carried
me
off
in
my
childhood
and
robbed
me
of
the
pleasure
of
my
youth
that
part
of
my
cake
has
been
eaten
and
in
spite
of
some
occasional
headache
has
been
digested
not
altogether
unsatisfactorily
lady
desmond
had
as
yet
been
allowed
no
slice
of
her
cake
she
had
never
yet
taken
her
side
in
any
game
of
rounders
but
she
too
had
looked
on
and
seen
how
jocund
was
the
play
she
also
had
acknowledged
that
that
running
in
the
ring
that
stout
hitting
of
the
ball
that
innocent
craft
that
bringing
back
by
her
own
skill
and
with
her
own
hand
of
some
fellow
would
be
pleasant
to
her
as
well
as
to
others
if
only
she
now
could
be
chosen
in
at
that
game
but
what
if
the
side
that
she
cared
for
would
not
have
her
but
edax
though
it
had
hardly
nibbled
at
her
heart
or
wishes
had
been
feeding
on
the
freshness
of
her
brow
and
the
bloom
of
her
lips
the
child
with
whom
she
would
have
loved
to
play
kept
aloof
from
her
too
and
would
not
pick
up
the
ball
when
it
rolled
to
his
feet
all
this
if
one
thinks
of
it
is
hard
to
bear
it
is
very
hard
to
have
had
no
period
for
rounders
not
to
be
able
even
to
look
back
to
one
games
and
to
talk
of
them
to
one
old
comrades
but
why
then
did
she
allow
herself
to
be
carried
off
by
the
wicked
wrinkled
earl
with
the
gloating
eyes
asks
of
me
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
world
just
turned
eighteen
oh
heavens
is
it
not
possible
that
one
should
have
one
more
game
of
rounders
quite
impossible
o
my
fat
friend
and
therefore
i
answer
the
young
lady
somewhat
grimly
take
care
that
thou
also
art
not
carried
off
by
a
wrinkled
earl
is
thy
heart
free
from
all
vanity
of
what
nature
is
the
heroism
that
thou
worshippest
a
nice
young
man
she
says
boldly
though
in
words
somewhat
different
if
so
it
will
be
well
for
thee
but
did
i
not
see
thine
eyes
hankering
the
other
day
after
the
precious
stones
of
ophir
and
thy
mouth
watering
for
the
of
egypt
was
i
not
watching
thee
as
thou
sattest
at
that
counter
so
frightfully
intent
beware
the
grumpy
old
fellow
with
the
bald
head
she
said
shortly
afterwards
to
her
bosom
friend
not
careful
that
her
words
should
be
duly
inaudible
some
idea
that
all
was
not
yet
over
with
her
had
come
upon
her
poor
heart
upon
lady
desmond
heart
soon
after
owen
fitzgerald
had
made
himself
familiar
in
her
old
mansion
we
have
read
how
that
idea
was
banished
and
how
she
had
ultimately
resolved
that
that
man
whom
she
could
have
loved
herself
should
be
given
up
to
her
own
child
when
she
thought
that
he
was
no
longer
poor
and
of
low
rank
she
could
not
sympathize
with
her
daughter
love
with
her
love
and
rejoice
with
her
joy
but
she
could
do
her
duty
by
her
and
according
to
her
lights
she
endeavoured
so
to
do
but
now
again
all
was
turned
and
changed
and
altered
owen
of
hap
house
was
once
more
owen
of
hap
house
only
but
still
in
her
eyes
heroic
as
it
behoved
a
man
to
be
he
would
not
creep
about
the
country
with
moaning
voice
and
melancholy
eyes
with
draggled
dress
and
outward
signs
of
wretchedness
he
might
be
wretched
but
he
would
still
be
manly
could
it
be
possible
that
to
her
should
yet
be
given
the
privilege
of
soothing
that
noble
unbending
wretchedness
by
no
means
possible
poor
countess
thy
years
are
all
against
thee
girls
whose
mouths
will
water
unduly
for
the
of
egypt
must
in
after
life
undergo
such
penalties
as
these
art
thou
not
a
countess
but
not
so
did
she
answer
herself
might
it
not
be
possible
ah
might
it
not
be
possible
and
as
the
question
was
even
then
being
asked
perhaps
for
the
ten
thousandth
time
owen
fitzgerald
stood
before
her
she
had
not
yet
seen
him
since
the
new
news
had
gone
abroad
and
had
hardly
yet
conceived
how
it
might
be
possible
that
she
should
do
so
but
now
as
she
thought
of
him
there
he
was
they
two
were
together
alone
together
and
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
had
closed
upon
him
before
she
was
aware
of
his
presence
owen
fitzgerald
she
said
starting
up
and
giving
him
both
her
hands
this
she
did
not
of
judgment
nor
yet
from
passion
but
of
impulse
she
had
been
thinking
of
him
with
such
kindly
thoughts
and
now
he
was
there
it
became
natural
that
her
greeting
should
be
kindly
it
was
more
so
than
it
had
ever
been
to
any
but
her
son
since
the
wrinkled
gloating
earl
had
come
and
fetched
her
yes
owen
fitzgerald
said
he
taking
the
two
hands
that
were
offered
to
him
and
holding
them
awhile
not
pressing
them
as
a
man
who
loved
her
who
could
have
loved
her
would
have
done
after
all
that
has
gone
and
passed
between
us
lady
desmond
i
can
not
leave
the
country
without
saying
one
word
of
farewell
to
you
leave
the
country
she
exclaimed
and
where
are
you
going
as
she
looked
into
his
face
with
her
hands
still
in
his
for
she
did
not
on
the
moment
withdraw
them
she
felt
that
he
had
never
before
looked
so
noble
so
handsome
so
grand
leave
the
country
ah
yes
and
why
should
not
she
leave
it
also
what
was
there
to
bind
her
to
those
odious
walls
in
which
she
had
been
immolated
during
the
best
half
of
her
life
where
are
you
going
she
asked
looking
almost
wildly
up
at
him
somewhere
very
far
lady
desmond
he
said
and
then
the
hands
dropped
from
him
you
will
understand
at
any
rate
that
hap
house
will
not
be
a
fitting
residence
for
me
i
hate
the
whole
country
said
she
the
whole
place
hereabouts
i
have
never
been
happy
here
happy
i
have
never
been
other
than
unhappy
i
have
been
wretched
what
would
i
not
give
to
leave
it
also
to
you
it
can
not
be
intolerable
as
it
will
be
to
me
you
have
known
so
thoroughly
where
all
my
hopes
were
garnered
that
i
need
not
tell
you
why
i
must
go
from
hap
house
i
think
that
i
have
been
wronged
but
i
do
not
desire
that
others
should
think
so
and
as
for
you
and
me
lady
desmond
though
we
have
been
enemies
we
have
been
friends
also
enemies
said
she
i
hope
not
and
she
spoke
so
softly
so
unlike
her
usual
self
in
the
tones
so
suited
to
a
loving
clinging
woman
that
though
he
did
not
understand
it
he
was
startled
at
her
tenderness
i
have
never
felt
that
you
were
my
enemy
fitzgerald
and
certainly
i
never
was
an
enemy
to
you
well
we
were
opposed
to
each
other
i
thought
that
you
were
robbing
me
of
all
i
valued
in
life
and
you
you
thought
i
thought
that
clara
happiness
demanded
rank
and
wealth
and
position
there
i
tell
you
my
sins
fairly
you
may
say
that
i
was
mercenary
if
you
will
mercenary
for
her
i
thought
that
i
knew
what
would
be
needful
for
her
can
you
be
angry
with
a
mother
for
that
she
had
given
me
a
promise
but
never
mind
it
is
all
over
now
i
did
not
come
to
upbraid
you
but
to
tell
you
that
i
now
know
how
it
must
be
and
that
i
am
going
had
you
won
her
owen
said
the
countess
looking
intently
into
his
face
had
you
won
her
she
would
not
have
made
you
happy
as
to
that
it
was
for
me
to
judge
for
me
and
her
i
thought
it
would
and
was
willing
to
peril
all
in
the
trial
and
so
was
she
willing
at
one
time
but
never
mind
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
that
quite
useless
now
i
did
think
when
it
was
as
they
said
in
my
power
to
give
him
back
his
own
i
did
think
but
no
it
would
have
been
mean
to
look
for
payment
it
is
all
over
and
i
will
say
nothing
further
not
a
word
i
am
not
a
girl
to
harp
on
such
a
thing
day
after
day
and
to
grow
sick
with
love
i
shall
be
better
away
and
therefore
i
am
going
and
i
have
now
come
to
say
because
we
were
friends
in
old
days
lady
desmond
friends
in
old
days
they
were
old
days
to
him
but
they
were
no
more
than
the
other
day
to
her
it
was
as
yet
hardly
more
than
two
years
since
she
had
first
known
him
and
yet
he
looked
on
the
acquaintance
as
one
that
had
run
out
its
time
and
required
to
be
ended
she
would
so
fain
have
been
able
to
think
that
the
beginning
only
had
as
yet
come
to
them
but
there
he
was
anxious
to
bid
her
adieu
and
what
was
she
to
say
to
him
yes
we
were
friends
you
have
been
my
only
friend
here
i
think
you
will
hardly
believe
with
how
much
true
friendship
i
have
thought
of
you
when
the
feud
between
us
if
it
was
a
feud
was
at
the
strongest
owen
fitzgerald
i
have
loved
you
through
it
all
loved
him
she
was
so
handsome
as
she
spoke
so
womanly
so
graceful
there
was
still
about
her
so
much
of
the
charm
of
beauty
that
he
could
hardly
take
the
word
when
coming
from
her
mouth
as
applicable
to
ordinary
friendship
and
yet
he
did
so
take
it
they
had
all
loved
each
other
as
friends
should
love
and
now
that
he
was
going
she
had
chosen
to
say
as
much
he
felt
the
blood
tingle
his
cheek
at
the
sound
of
her
words
but
he
was
not
vain
enough
to
take
it
in
its
usual
sense
then
we
will
part
as
friends
said
he
tamely
enough
yes
we
will
part
she
said
and
as
she
spoke
the
blood
mantled
deep
on
her
neck
and
cheek
and
forehead
and
a
spirit
came
out
of
her
eye
such
as
never
had
shone
there
before
in
his
presence
yes
we
will
part
and
she
took
up
his
right
hand
and
held
it
closely
pressed
between
both
her
own
and
as
we
must
part
i
will
tell
you
all
owen
fitzgerald
i
have
loved
you
with
all
my
heart
with
all
the
love
that
a
woman
has
to
give
i
have
loved
you
and
have
never
loved
any
other
stop
stop
for
he
was
going
to
interrupt
her
you
shall
hear
me
now
to
the
last
and
for
the
last
time
i
have
loved
you
with
such
love
such
love
as
you
perhaps
felt
for
her
but
as
she
will
never
feel
but
you
shall
not
say
nay
you
shall
not
think
that
i
have
been
selfish
i
would
have
kept
you
from
her
when
you
were
poor
as
you
are
now
not
because
i
loved
you
no
you
will
never
think
that
of
me
and
when
i
thought
that
you
were
rich
and
the
head
of
your
family
i
did
all
that
i
could
to
bring
her
back
for
you
did
i
not
owen
yes
i
think
you
did
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
hardly
knowing
how
to
speak
indeed
indeed
i
did
so
others
may
say
that
i
was
selfish
for
my
child
but
you
shall
not
think
that
i
was
selfish
for
myself
i
sent
for
patrick
and
bade
him
go
to
you
i
strove
as
mothers
do
strive
for
their
children
i
taught
myself
i
strove
to
teach
myself
to
forget
that
i
had
loved
you
i
swore
on
my
knees
that
i
would
love
you
only
as
my
son
as
my
dear
dear
son
nay
owen
i
did
on
my
knees
before
my
god
he
turned
away
from
her
to
rub
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
in
doing
so
he
dragged
his
hand
away
from
her
but
she
followed
him
and
again
took
it
you
will
hear
me
to
the
end
now
she
said
will
you
not
you
will
not
begrudge
me
that
and
then
came
these
other
tidings
and
all
that
scheme
was
dashed
to
the
ground
it
was
better
so
owen
you
would
not
have
been
happy
with
the
property
i
should
never
have
taken
it
and
she
she
would
have
clung
closer
to
him
as
a
poor
man
than
ever
she
had
done
when
he
was
rich
she
is
her
mother
daughter
there
and
then
then
but
i
need
not
tell
you
more
you
will
know
it
all
now
if
you
had
become
rich
i
would
have
ceased
to
love
you
but
i
shall
never
cease
now
that
you
are
again
poor
now
that
you
are
owen
of
hap
house
again
as
you
sent
us
word
yourself
that
day
and
then
she
ceased
and
bending
down
her
head
bathed
his
hand
with
her
tears
had
any
one
asked
him
that
morning
he
would
have
said
that
it
was
impossible
that
the
countess
of
desmond
should
weep
and
now
the
tears
were
streaming
from
her
eyes
as
though
she
were
a
girl
and
so
she
was
her
girlhood
had
been
postponed
and
marred
not
destroyed
and
made
away
with
by
the
wrinkled
earl
with
the
gloating
eyes
she
had
said
all
now
and
she
stood
there
still
holding
his
hand
in
hers
but
with
her
head
turned
from
him
it
was
his
turn
to
speak
now
and
how
was
he
to
answer
her
i
know
how
most
men
would
have
answered
by
the
pressure
of
an
arm
by
a
warm
kiss
by
a
promise
of
love
and
by
a
feeling
that
such
love
was
possible
and
then
most
men
would
have
gone
home
leaving
the
woman
triumphant
and
have
repented
bitterly
as
they
sat
moody
over
their
own
fires
with
their
before
them
but
it
was
not
so
with
owen
fitzgerald
his
heart
was
to
him
a
reality
he
had
loved
with
all
his
power
and
strength
with
all
the
vigour
of
his
soul
having
chosen
to
love
but
he
would
not
now
be
enticed
by
pity
into
a
bastard
feeling
which
would
die
away
when
the
tenderness
of
the
moment
was
no
longer
present
to
his
eye
and
touch
his
love
for
clara
had
been
such
that
he
could
not
even
say
that
he
loved
another
dear
lady
desmond
he
began
ah
owen
we
are
to
part
now
part
for
ever
she
said
speak
to
me
once
in
your
life
as
though
we
were
equal
friends
can
not
you
forget
for
one
minute
that
i
am
countess
of
desmond
mary
countess
of
desmond
such
was
her
name
and
title
but
so
little
familiar
had
he
been
with
the
name
by
which
he
had
never
heard
her
called
that
in
his
confusion
he
could
not
remember
it
and
had
he
done
so
he
could
not
have
brought
himself
to
use
it
yes
he
said
we
must
part
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
remain
here
doubly
impossible
now
she
replied
half
reproaching
him
yes
doubly
impossible
now
is
it
not
better
that
the
truth
should
be
spoken
oh
yes
i
have
spoken
it
too
plainly
and
so
will
i
speak
it
plainly
we
can
not
control
our
own
hearts
lady
desmond
it
is
as
you
say
doubly
impossible
now
all
the
love
i
have
had
to
give
she
has
had
and
has
such
being
so
why
should
i
stay
here
or
could
you
wish
that
i
should
do
so
i
do
not
wish
it
that
was
true
enough
the
wish
would
have
been
to
wander
away
with
him
i
must
go
and
shall
start
at
once
my
very
things
are
packed
for
my
going
i
will
not
be
here
to
have
the
sound
of
their
marriage
bells
jangling
in
my
ears
i
will
not
be
pointed
at
as
the
man
who
has
been
duped
on
every
side
ah
me
that
i
was
a
man
too
that
i
could
go
away
and
make
for
myself
a
life
you
have
desmond
with
you
no
no
he
will
go
too
of
course
he
will
go
he
will
go
and
i
shall
be
utterly
alone
what
a
fool
i
am
what
an
ass
that
by
this
time
i
have
not
learned
to
bear
it
they
will
always
be
near
you
at
castle
richmond
ah
owen
how
little
you
understand
have
we
been
friends
while
we
lived
under
the
same
roof
and
now
that
she
is
there
do
you
think
that
she
will
heed
me
i
tell
you
that
you
do
not
know
her
she
is
excellent
good
devoted
but
cold
as
ice
she
will
live
among
the
poor
and
grace
his
table
and
he
will
have
all
that
he
wants
in
twelve
months
owen
she
would
have
turned
your
heart
to
a
stone
it
is
that
already
i
think
said
he
at
any
rate
it
will
be
so
to
all
others
lady
desmond
owen
and
god
bless
you
my
secret
will
be
safe
with
you
safe
yes
it
will
be
safe
and
then
as
she
put
her
cheek
up
to
him
he
kissed
it
and
left
her
he
had
been
very
stern
she
had
laid
bare
to
him
her
whole
heart
and
he
had
answered
her
love
by
never
a
word
he
had
made
no
reply
in
any
shape
given
her
no
thanks
for
her
heart
treasure
he
had
responded
to
her
affection
by
no
tenderness
he
had
not
even
said
that
this
might
have
been
so
had
that
other
not
have
come
to
pass
by
no
word
had
he
alluded
to
her
confession
but
had
regarded
her
delusion
as
monstrous
a
thing
of
which
no
word
was
to
be
spoken
so
at
least
said
the
countess
to
herself
sitting
there
all
alone
where
he
had
left
her
he
regards
me
as
old
and
worn
in
his
eyes
i
am
wrinkled
and
ugly
was
thus
that
her
thoughts
expressed
themselves
and
then
she
walked
across
the
room
towards
the
mirror
but
when
there
she
could
not
look
in
it
she
turned
her
back
upon
it
without
a
glance
and
returned
to
her
seat
by
the
window
what
mattered
it
now
it
was
her
doom
to
live
there
alone
for
the
term
of
life
with
which
it
might
still
please
god
to
afflict
her
and
then
looking
out
from
the
window
her
eyes
fell
upon
owen
as
he
rode
slowly
down
across
the
park
his
horse
was
walking
very
slowly
and
it
seemed
as
though
he
himself
were
unconscious
of
the
pace
as
long
as
he
remained
in
sight
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
from
his
figure
gazing
at
him
painfully
as
he
grew
dimmer
and
more
dim
in
the
distance
then
at
last
he
turned
behind
the
bushes
near
the
lodge
and
she
felt
that
she
was
all
alone
it
was
the
last
that
she
ever
saw
of
owen
fitzgerald
unfortunate
girl
marred
in
thy
childhood
by
that
wrinkled
earl
with
the
gloating
eyes
or
marred
rather
by
thine
own
vanity
those
of
egypt
are
they
not
always
thus
bitter
in
the
eating
chapter
xliv
conclusion
and
now
my
story
is
told
and
were
it
not
for
the
fashion
of
the
thing
this
last
short
chapter
might
be
spared
it
shall
at
any
rate
be
very
short
were
it
not
that
i
eschew
the
fashion
of
double
names
for
a
book
thinking
that
no
amount
of
ingenuity
in
this
respect
will
make
a
bad
book
pass
muster
whereas
a
good
book
will
turn
out
as
such
though
no
such
ingenuity
be
displayed
i
might
have
called
this
a
tale
of
the
famine
year
in
ireland
at
the
period
of
the
year
to
which
the
story
has
brought
us
and
at
which
it
will
leave
us
the
famine
was
at
its
very
worst
people
were
beginning
to
believe
that
there
would
never
be
a
bit
more
to
eat
in
the
land
and
that
the
time
for
hope
and
energy
was
gone
land
was
becoming
of
no
value
and
the
only
thing
regarded
was
a
sufficiency
of
food
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
under
such
circumstances
it
was
difficult
to
hope
but
energy
without
hope
is
impossible
and
therefore
was
there
such
an
apathy
and
deadness
through
the
country
it
was
not
that
they
did
not
work
who
were
most
concerned
to
work
the
amount
of
conscientious
work
then
done
was
most
praiseworthy
but
it
was
done
almost
without
hope
of
success
and
done
chiefly
as
a
matter
of
conscience
there
was
a
feeling
which
was
not
often
expressed
but
which
seemed
to
prevail
everywhere
that
ginger
would
not
again
be
hot
in
the
mouth
and
that
in
very
truth
the
time
for
cakes
and
ale
in
this
world
was
all
over
it
was
this
feeling
that
made
a
residence
in
ireland
at
that
period
so
very
sad
ah
me
how
little
do
we
know
what
is
coming
to
us
irish
cakes
and
ale
were
done
and
over
for
this
world
we
all
thought
but
in
truth
the
irish
cakes
were
only
then
and
the
irish
ale
was
being
brewed
i
am
not
sure
that
these
good
things
are
yet
quite
fit
for
the
palates
of
the
guest
not
as
fit
as
a
little
more
time
will
make
them
the
cake
is
still
too
new
cakes
often
are
and
the
ale
is
not
sufficiently
mellowed
but
of
this
i
am
sure
that
the
cakes
and
ale
are
there
and
the
ginger
too
very
hot
in
the
mouth
let
a
committee
of
irish
landlords
say
how
the
rents
are
paid
now
and
what
amount
of
arrears
was
due
through
the
country
when
the
famine
came
among
them
rents
paid
to
the
day
that
is
the
ginger
hot
in
the
mouth
which
best
pleases
the
palate
of
a
country
gentleman
but
if
one
did
in
truth
write
a
tale
of
the
famine
after
that
it
would
behove
the
author
to
write
a
tale
of
the
pestilence
and
then
another
a
tale
of
the
exodus
these
three
wonderful
events
following
each
other
were
the
blessings
coming
from
omniscience
and
omnipotence
by
which
the
black
clouds
were
driven
from
the
irish
firmament
if
one
through
it
all
could
have
dared
to
hope
and
have
had
from
the
first
that
wisdom
which
has
learned
to
acknowledge
that
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
and
then
the
same
author
going
on
with
his
series
would
give
in
his
last
set
ireland
in
her
prosperity
of
all
those
who
did
true
good
conscientious
work
at
this
time
none
exceeded
in
energy
our
friend
herbert
fitzgerald
after
his
return
to
castle
richmond
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
some
were
due
from
him
for
all
the
good
things
that
providence
had
showered
upon
him
and
the
best
that
he
could
give
was
a
devoted
attention
to
the
interest
of
the
poor
around
him
somers
soon
resigned
to
him
the
chair
at
those
committee
meetings
at
berryhill
and
gortnaclough
and
it
was
acknowledged
that
the
castle
richmond
arrangements
for
relief
and
might
be
taken
as
a
model
for
the
south
of
ireland
few
other
men
were
able
to
go
to
the
work
with
means
so
ample
and
with
hands
so
perfectly
free
carter
even
who
by
this
time
had
become
cemented
in
a
warm
trilateral
friendship
with
father
barney
and
the
rev
√¶neas
townsend
was
obliged
to
own
that
many
a
young
english
country
gentleman
might
take
a
lesson
from
sir
herbert
fitzgerald
in
the
duties
peculiar
to
his
position
his
marriage
did
not
take
place
till
full
six
months
after
the
period
to
which
our
story
has
brought
us
baronets
with
twelve
thousand
a
year
can
not
be
married
off
the
hooks
as
may
be
done
with
ordinary
mortals
settlements
of
a
grandiose
nature
were
required
and
were
duly
concocted
perhaps
mr
die
had
something
to
say
to
them
so
that
the
great
maxim
of
the
law
was
brought
into
play
perhaps
also
though
of
this
herbert
heard
no
word
it
was
thought
inexpedient
to
hurry
matters
while
any
further
inquiry
was
possible
in
that
affair
of
the
mollett
connection
mr
die
and
prendergast
were
certainly
going
about
still
drawing
all
coverts
far
and
near
lest
their
fox
might
not
have
been
fairly
run
to
his
last
earth
but
as
i
have
said
no
tidings
as
to
this
reached
castle
richmond
there
in
ireland
no
man
troubled
himself
further
with
any
doubt
upon
the
subject
and
sir
herbert
took
his
title
and
received
his
rents
by
the
hands
of
somers
exactly
as
though
the
molletts
father
and
son
had
never
appeared
in
those
parts
it
was
six
months
before
the
marriage
was
celebrated
but
during
a
considerable
part
of
that
time
clara
remained
a
visitor
at
castle
richmond
to
lady
fitzgerald
she
was
now
the
same
as
a
daughter
and
to
aunt
letty
the
same
as
a
niece
by
the
girls
she
had
for
months
been
regarded
as
a
sister
so
she
remained
in
the
house
of
which
she
was
to
be
the
mistress
learning
to
know
their
ways
and
ingratiating
herself
with
those
who
were
to
be
dependent
on
her
but
i
had
rather
stay
with
you
mamma
if
you
will
allow
me
clara
had
said
to
her
mother
when
the
countess
was
making
some
arrangement
with
her
that
she
should
return
to
castle
richmond
i
shall
be
leaving
you
altogether
so
soon
now
and
she
got
up
close
to
her
mother
side
caressingly
and
would
fain
have
pressed
into
her
arms
and
kissed
her
and
have
talked
to
her
of
what
was
coming
as
a
daughter
loves
to
talk
to
a
loving
mother
but
lady
desmond
heart
was
sore
and
sad
and
harsh
and
she
preferred
to
be
alone
you
will
be
better
at
castle
richmond
my
dear
you
will
be
much
happier
there
of
course
there
can
be
no
reason
why
you
should
come
again
into
the
gloom
of
this
prison
but
i
should
be
with
you
dearest
mamma
it
is
better
that
you
should
be
with
the
fitzgeralds
now
and
as
for
me
i
must
learn
to
live
alone
indeed
i
have
learned
it
so
you
need
not
mind
for
me
clara
was
rebuffed
by
the
tone
rather
than
the
words
but
she
still
looked
up
into
her
mother
face
wistfully
go
my
dear
said
the
countess
i
would
sooner
be
alone
at
present
and
so
clara
went
it
was
hard
upon
her
that
even
now
her
mother
would
not
accept
her
love
but
lady
desmond
could
not
be
cordial
with
her
daughter
she
made
more
than
one
struggle
to
do
so
but
always
failed
she
could
she
thought
that
she
could
have
watched
her
child
happiness
with
contentment
had
clara
married
owen
fitzgerald
sir
owen
as
he
would
then
have
been
but
now
she
could
only
remember
that
owen
was
lost
to
them
both
lost
through
her
child
fault
she
did
not
hate
clara
nay
she
would
have
made
any
sacrifice
for
her
daughter
welfare
but
she
could
not
take
her
lovingly
to
her
bosom
so
she
shut
herself
up
alone
in
her
prison
as
she
called
it
and
then
looked
back
upon
the
errors
of
her
life
it
was
as
well
for
her
to
look
back
as
to
look
forward
for
what
joy
was
there
for
which
she
could
dare
to
hope
in
the
days
that
were
coming
however
she
did
relax
something
of
her
sternness
clara
was
of
course
married
from
desmond
court
and
the
very
necessity
of
making
some
preparations
for
this
festivity
was
in
itself
salutary
but
indeed
it
could
hardly
be
called
a
festivity
it
was
so
quiet
and
sombre
clara
had
but
two
bridesmaids
and
they
were
mary
and
emmeline
fitzgerald
the
young
earl
gave
away
his
sister
and
aunt
letty
was
there
and
prendergast
who
had
come
over
about
the
settlements
somers
also
attended
and
the
ceremony
was
performed
by
our
old
friend
townsend
beyond
these
there
were
no
guests
at
the
wedding
of
sir
herbert
fitzgerald
the
young
earl
was
there
and
at
the
last
the
wedding
had
been
postponed
a
week
for
his
coming
he
had
left
eton
at
midsummer
in
order
that
he
might
travel
for
a
couple
of
years
with
owen
fitzgerald
before
he
went
to
oxford
it
had
been
the
lad
own
request
and
had
been
for
a
while
refused
by
owen
but
fitzgerald
had
at
last
given
way
to
the
earl
love
and
they
had
started
together
for
norway
they
want
me
to
be
home
he
had
said
one
morning
to
his
friend
ah
yes
i
suppose
so
do
you
know
why
they
had
never
spoken
a
word
about
clara
since
they
had
left
england
together
and
the
earl
now
dreaded
to
mention
her
name
know
why
replied
owen
of
course
i
do
it
is
to
give
away
your
sister
go
home
desmond
my
boy
when
you
have
returned
we
will
talk
about
her
i
shall
bear
it
better
when
i
know
that
she
is
his
wife
and
so
it
was
with
them
for
two
years
lord
desmond
travelled
with
him
and
after
that
owen
fitzgerald
went
on
upon
his
wanderings
alone
many
a
long
year
has
run
by
since
that
and
yet
he
has
never
come
back
to
hap
house
men
of
the
county
cork
now
talk
of
him
as
one
whom
they
knew
long
since
he
who
took
his
house
as
a
stranger
is
a
stranger
no
longer
in
the
country
and
the
place
that
owen
left
vacant
has
been
filled
the
hounds
of
duhallow
would
not
recognize
his
voice
nor
would
the
steed
in
the
stable
follow
gently
at
his
heels
but
there
is
yet
one
left
who
thinks
of
him
hoping
that
she
may
yet
see
him
before
she
dies
