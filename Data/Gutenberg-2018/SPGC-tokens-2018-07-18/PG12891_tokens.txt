shows
thesiger
in
her
home
the
geneva
express
jerked
itself
out
of
the
gare
de
lyons
for
a
few
minutes
the
lights
of
outer
paris
twinkled
past
its
windows
and
then
with
a
spring
it
reached
the
open
night
the
jolts
and
lurches
merged
into
one
regular
purposeful
throb
the
shrieks
of
the
wheels
the
clatter
of
the
coaches
into
one
continuous
hum
and
already
in
the
upper
berth
of
her
compartment
thesiger
was
asleep
the
noise
of
a
train
had
no
unrest
for
her
indeed
a
sleeping
compartment
in
a
continental
express
was
the
most
permanent
home
which
thesiger
had
possessed
for
a
good
many
more
years
than
she
would
have
cared
to
acknowledge
she
spent
her
life
in
hotels
with
her
daughter
for
an
unconsidered
companion
from
a
winter
in
vienna
or
in
rome
she
passed
to
a
spring
at
venice
or
at
constantinople
thence
to
a
june
in
paris
a
july
and
august
at
the
bathing
places
a
september
at
aix
an
autumn
in
paris
again
but
always
she
came
back
to
the
it
was
the
one
familiar
room
which
was
always
ready
for
her
and
though
the
prospect
from
its
windows
changed
it
was
the
one
room
she
knew
which
had
always
the
same
look
the
same
cramped
space
the
same
furniture
the
one
room
where
the
moment
she
stepped
into
it
she
was
at
home
yet
on
this
particular
journey
she
woke
while
it
was
yet
dark
a
noise
slight
in
comparison
to
the
clatter
of
the
train
but
distinct
in
character
and
quite
near
told
her
at
once
what
had
disturbed
her
some
one
was
moving
stealthily
in
the
compartment
her
daughter
that
was
all
but
thesiger
lay
quite
still
and
as
would
happen
to
her
at
times
a
sudden
terror
gripped
her
by
the
heart
she
heard
the
girl
beneath
her
dressing
very
quietly
subduing
the
rustle
of
her
garments
even
the
sound
of
her
breathing
how
much
does
she
know
thesiger
asked
of
herself
and
her
heart
sank
and
she
dared
not
answer
the
rustling
ceased
a
sharp
click
was
heard
and
the
next
moment
through
a
broad
pane
of
glass
a
faint
twilight
crept
into
the
carriage
the
blind
had
been
raised
from
one
of
the
windows
it
was
two
on
a
morning
of
july
and
the
dawn
was
breaking
very
swiftly
the
daylight
broadened
and
against
the
window
there
came
into
view
the
profile
of
a
girl
head
and
face
seen
as
thesiger
saw
it
with
the
light
still
dim
behind
it
it
was
black
like
an
ancient
daguerreotype
it
was
also
as
motionless
and
as
grave
how
much
does
she
know
the
question
would
thrust
itself
into
the
mother
thoughts
she
watched
her
daughter
intently
from
the
dark
corner
where
her
head
lay
thinking
that
with
the
broadening
of
the
day
she
might
read
the
answer
in
that
still
face
but
she
read
nothing
even
when
every
feature
was
revealed
in
the
clear
dead
light
for
the
face
which
she
saw
was
the
face
of
one
who
lived
much
apart
within
itself
building
amongst
her
own
dreams
as
a
child
builds
upon
the
sand
and
pays
no
heed
to
those
who
pass
and
to
none
of
her
dreams
had
thesiger
the
key
deliberately
her
daughter
had
withdrawn
herself
amongst
them
and
they
had
given
her
this
return
for
her
company
they
had
kept
her
fresh
and
gentle
in
a
circle
where
freshness
was
soon
lost
and
gentleness
put
aside
sylvia
thesiger
was
at
this
time
seventeen
although
her
mother
dressed
her
to
look
younger
and
even
then
overdressed
her
like
a
toy
it
was
of
a
piece
with
the
nature
of
the
girl
that
in
this
matter
as
in
the
rest
she
made
no
protest
she
foresaw
the
scene
the
useless
scene
which
would
follow
upon
her
protest
exclamations
against
her
ingratitude
abuse
for
her
impertinence
and
very
likely
a
facile
shower
of
tears
at
the
end
and
her
dignity
forbade
her
to
enter
upon
it
she
just
let
her
mother
dress
her
as
she
chose
and
she
withdrew
just
a
little
more
into
the
secret
chamber
of
her
dreams
she
sat
now
looking
steadily
out
of
the
window
with
her
eyes
uplifted
and
aloof
in
a
fashion
which
had
become
natural
to
her
and
her
mother
was
seized
with
a
pang
of
envy
at
the
girl
beauty
for
beauty
sylvia
thesiger
had
uncommon
in
its
quality
rather
than
in
its
degree
from
the
temples
to
the
round
point
of
her
chin
the
contour
of
her
face
described
a
perfect
oval
her
forehead
was
broad
and
low
and
her
hair
which
in
color
was
a
dark
chestnut
parted
in
the
middle
whence
it
rippled
in
two
thick
daring
waves
to
the
ears
a
fashion
which
noticeably
became
her
and
it
was
gathered
behind
into
a
plait
which
lay
rather
low
upon
the
nape
of
her
neck
her
eyes
were
big
of
a
dark
gray
hue
and
very
quiet
in
their
scrutiny
her
mouth
small
and
provoking
it
provoked
when
still
with
the
promise
of
a
very
winning
smile
and
the
smile
itself
was
not
so
frequent
but
that
it
provoked
a
desire
to
summon
it
to
her
lips
again
it
had
a
way
of
hesitating
as
though
sylvia
were
not
sure
whether
she
would
smile
or
not
and
when
she
had
made
up
her
mind
it
dimpled
her
cheeks
and
transfigured
her
whole
face
and
revealed
in
her
tenderness
and
a
sense
of
humor
her
complexion
was
pale
but
clear
her
figure
was
slender
and
active
but
without
angularities
and
she
was
of
the
middle
height
yet
the
quality
which
the
eye
first
remarked
in
her
was
not
so
much
her
beauty
as
a
certain
purity
a
look
almost
of
the
madonna
a
certainty
one
might
say
that
even
in
the
circle
in
which
she
moved
she
had
kept
herself
unspotted
from
the
world
thus
she
looked
as
she
sat
by
the
carriage
window
but
as
the
train
drew
near
to
ambérieu
the
air
brightened
and
the
sunlight
ministered
to
her
beauty
like
a
careful
handmaid
touching
her
pale
cheeks
to
a
rosy
warmth
giving
a
luster
to
her
hair
and
humanizing
her
to
a
smile
sylvia
sat
forward
a
little
as
though
to
meet
the
sunlight
then
she
turned
toward
the
carriage
and
saw
her
mother
eyes
intently
watching
her
you
are
awake
she
said
in
surprise
yes
child
you
woke
me
i
am
very
sorry
i
was
as
quiet
as
i
could
be
i
could
not
sleep
why
thesiger
repeated
the
question
with
insistence
why
you
sleep
we
are
traveling
to
chamonix
replied
sylvia
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
all
night
and
though
she
smiled
in
all
sincerity
thesiger
doubted
she
lay
silent
for
a
little
while
then
she
said
with
a
detachment
perhaps
slightly
too
marked
we
left
trouville
in
a
hurry
yesterday
did
we
yes
replied
sylvia
i
suppose
we
did
and
she
spoke
as
though
this
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
given
the
matter
a
thought
trouville
was
altogether
too
hot
said
thesiger
and
again
silence
followed
but
thesiger
was
not
content
how
much
does
she
know
she
speculated
again
and
was
driven
on
to
find
an
answer
she
raised
herself
upon
her
elbow
and
while
rearranging
her
pillow
said
carelessly
sylvia
our
last
morning
at
trouville
you
were
reading
a
book
which
seemed
to
interest
you
very
much
yes
sylvia
volunteered
no
information
about
that
book
you
brought
it
down
to
the
sands
so
i
suppose
you
never
noticed
a
couple
who
passed
along
the
deal
boards
just
in
front
of
us
thesiger
laughed
and
her
head
fell
back
upon
her
pillow
but
during
that
movement
her
eyes
had
never
left
her
daughter
face
a
man
with
stiff
gray
hair
a
stiff
prim
face
and
a
figure
like
a
ramrod
oh
there
never
was
anything
so
stiff
a
noticeable
bitterness
began
to
sound
in
her
voice
and
increased
as
she
went
on
there
was
an
old
woman
with
him
as
precise
and
as
himself
but
you
did
see
them
i
never
saw
anything
so
ludicrous
as
that
couple
austere
and
provincial
as
their
clothes
walking
along
the
deal
boards
between
the
rows
of
smart
people
thesiger
laughed
as
she
recalled
the
picture
they
must
have
come
from
the
provinces
i
could
imagine
them
living
in
a
chateau
on
a
hill
overlooking
some
tiny
village
in
where
shall
we
say
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
with
an
air
of
audacity
she
shot
the
word
from
her
lips
in
provence
the
name
however
had
evidently
no
significance
for
sylvia
and
thesiger
was
relieved
of
her
fears
but
you
did
see
them
she
repeated
with
a
laugh
yes
i
did
said
sylvia
and
brought
her
mother
up
on
her
elbow
again
it
struck
me
that
the
old
lady
must
be
some
great
lady
of
a
past
day
the
man
bowed
to
you
and
she
stopped
abruptly
but
her
mother
completed
the
sentence
with
a
vindictiveness
she
made
little
effort
to
conceal
and
the
great
lady
did
not
but
stared
in
the
way
great
ladies
have
yes
i
had
met
the
man
once
in
paris
and
she
lay
back
again
upon
her
pillow
watching
her
daughter
but
sylvia
showed
no
curiosity
and
no
pain
it
was
not
the
first
time
when
people
passed
her
mother
that
she
had
seen
the
man
bow
and
the
woman
ignore
rather
she
had
come
to
expect
it
she
took
her
book
from
her
berth
and
opened
it
thesiger
was
satisfied
sylvia
clearly
did
not
suspect
that
it
was
just
the
appearance
of
that
stiff
couple
which
had
driven
her
out
of
trouville
a
good
month
before
her
time
her
thesiger
of
the
many
friends
she
fell
to
wondering
what
in
the
world
had
brought
de
camours
and
his
mother
to
that
watering
place
amongst
the
brilliant
and
the
painted
women
she
laughed
again
at
the
odd
picture
they
had
made
and
her
thoughts
went
back
over
twenty
years
to
the
time
when
she
had
been
the
wife
of
de
camours
in
the
château
overlooking
the
village
in
provence
and
de
camours
mother
had
watched
her
with
an
unceasing
jealousy
much
had
happened
since
those
days
madame
de
watchings
had
not
been
in
vain
a
decree
had
been
obtained
from
the
pope
annulling
the
marriage
much
had
happened
but
even
after
twenty
years
the
memory
of
that
formal
life
in
the
provencal
château
was
vivid
enough
and
thesiger
yawned
then
she
laughed
monsieur
de
camours
and
his
mother
had
always
been
able
to
make
people
yawn
so
you
are
glad
that
we
are
going
to
chamonix
sylvia
so
glad
that
you
could
sleep
yes
it
sounded
rather
unaccountable
to
thesiger
but
then
sylvia
was
to
her
a
rather
unaccountable
child
she
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
fell
asleep
sylvia
explanation
however
happened
to
be
true
chamonix
meant
the
great
range
of
mont
blanc
and
sylvia
thesiger
had
the
passion
for
mountains
in
her
blood
the
first
appearance
of
their
distant
snows
stirred
her
as
no
emotion
ever
had
so
that
she
came
to
date
her
life
by
these
appearances
rather
than
by
the
calendar
of
months
and
days
the
morning
when
from
the
hotel
windows
at
glion
she
had
first
seen
the
twin
peaks
of
the
dent
du
midi
towering
in
silver
high
above
a
blue
corner
of
the
lake
of
geneva
formed
one
memorable
date
once
too
in
the
as
the
rome
express
stopped
at
three
in
the
morning
at
the
frontier
on
the
italian
side
of
the
mont
cenis
tunnel
she
had
carefully
lifted
the
blind
on
the
side
of
the
sleeping
compartment
and
had
seen
a
great
wall
of
mountains
tower
up
in
a
clear
frosty
moonlight
from
great
buttresses
of
black
rock
to
delicate
pinnacles
of
ice
soaring
infinite
miles
away
into
a
cloudless
sky
of
blue
she
had
come
near
to
tears
that
night
as
she
looked
from
the
window
such
a
tumult
of
vague
longings
rushed
suddenly
in
upon
her
and
uplifted
her
she
was
made
aware
of
dim
uncomprehended
thoughts
stirring
in
the
depths
of
her
being
and
her
soul
was
drawn
upward
to
those
glittering
spires
as
to
enchanted
magnets
ever
afterward
sylvia
looked
forward
through
weeks
to
those
few
moments
in
her
mother
annual
itinerary
and
prayed
with
all
her
heart
that
the
night
might
be
clear
of
mist
and
rain
she
sat
now
at
the
window
with
no
thought
of
trouville
or
their
hurried
flight
with
each
throb
of
the
the
train
flashed
nearer
to
chamonix
she
opened
the
book
which
lay
upon
her
lap
the
book
in
which
she
had
been
so
interested
when
monsieur
de
camours
and
his
mother
passed
her
by
it
was
a
volume
of
the
alpine
journal
more
than
twenty
years
old
and
she
could
not
open
it
but
some
exploit
of
the
pioneers
took
her
eyes
some
history
of
a
first
ascent
of
an
unclimbed
peak
such
a
history
she
read
now
she
was
engrossed
in
it
and
yet
at
times
a
little
frown
of
annoyance
wrinkled
her
forehead
she
gave
an
explanation
of
her
annoyance
for
once
she
exclaimed
half
aloud
oh
if
only
he
would
be
so
the
author
was
indeed
being
very
funny
and
to
her
thinking
never
so
funny
as
when
the
narrative
should
have
been
most
engrossing
she
was
reading
the
account
of
the
first
ascent
of
an
aiguille
in
the
chamonix
district
held
by
guides
to
be
impossible
and
conquered
at
last
by
a
party
of
amateurs
in
spite
of
its
humor
sylvia
thesiger
was
thrilled
by
it
she
envied
the
three
men
who
had
taken
part
in
that
ascent
envied
them
their
courage
their
comradeship
their
bivouacs
in
the
open
air
beside
glowing
fires
on
some
high
shelf
of
rock
above
the
snows
but
most
of
all
her
imagination
was
touched
by
the
leader
of
that
expedition
the
man
who
sometimes
alone
sometimes
in
company
had
made
sixteen
separate
attacks
upon
that
peak
he
stared
from
the
pages
of
the
volume
gabriel
strood
something
of
his
great
reach
of
limb
of
his
activity
of
his
endurance
she
was
able
to
realize
moreover
he
had
a
particular
blemish
which
gave
to
him
a
particular
interest
in
her
eyes
for
it
would
have
deterred
most
men
altogether
from
his
pursuit
and
it
greatly
hampered
him
and
yet
in
spite
of
it
he
had
apparently
for
some
seasons
stood
prominent
in
the
alpine
fraternity
gabriel
strood
was
afflicted
with
a
weakness
in
the
muscles
of
one
thigh
sylvia
according
to
her
custom
began
to
picture
him
began
to
talk
with
him
she
wondered
whether
he
was
glad
to
have
reached
that
summit
or
whether
he
was
not
on
the
whole
rather
sorry
sorry
for
having
lost
out
of
his
life
a
great
and
interest
she
looked
through
the
subsequent
papers
in
the
volume
but
could
find
no
further
mention
of
his
name
she
perplexed
her
fancies
that
morning
she
speculated
whether
having
made
this
climb
he
had
stopped
and
climbed
no
more
or
whether
he
might
not
get
out
of
this
very
train
on
to
the
platform
at
chamonix
but
as
the
train
slowed
down
near
to
annemasse
she
remembered
that
the
exploit
of
which
she
had
read
had
taken
place
more
than
twenty
years
ago
chapter
ii
introduces
one
of
strood
successors
but
though
gabriel
strood
occupied
no
seat
in
that
train
one
of
his
successors
was
traveling
by
it
to
chamonix
after
an
absence
of
four
years
of
those
four
years
captain
chayne
had
passed
the
last
two
among
the
of
aden
with
the
yellow
land
of
arabia
at
his
back
longing
each
day
for
this
particular
morning
and
keeping
his
body
lithe
and
strong
against
its
coming
he
left
the
train
at
annemasse
and
crossing
the
rails
to
the
buffet
sat
down
at
the
table
next
to
that
which
thesiger
and
her
daughter
already
occupied
he
glanced
at
them
placed
them
in
their
category
and
looked
away
utterly
uninterested
they
belonged
to
the
great
class
of
the
continental
wanderers
people
of
whom
little
is
known
and
everything
suspected
people
with
no
kinsfolk
who
flit
from
hotel
to
hotel
and
gather
about
them
for
a
season
the
knowing
men
and
the
ignorant
young
ones
and
perhaps
here
and
there
an
unwary
woman
deceived
by
the
more
than
fashionable
cut
of
their
clothes
the
mother
he
put
down
as
nearer
forty
than
thirty
and
engaged
in
a
struggle
against
odds
to
look
nearer
twenty
than
thirty
the
daughter
face
chayne
could
not
see
for
it
was
bent
persistently
over
a
book
but
he
thought
of
a
big
doll
in
a
christmas
from
her
delicate
bronze
shoes
to
her
large
hat
of
mauve
tulle
everything
that
she
wore
was
unsuitable
the
frock
with
its
elaborations
of
lace
and
ribbons
might
have
passed
on
the
deal
boards
of
trouville
here
at
annemasse
her
superfineness
condemned
her
chayne
would
have
thought
no
more
of
her
but
as
he
passed
her
table
on
his
way
out
of
the
buffet
his
eyes
happened
to
fall
on
the
book
which
so
engrossed
her
there
was
a
diagram
upon
the
page
with
which
he
was
familiar
she
was
reading
an
old
volume
of
the
alpine
journal
chayne
was
puzzled
there
was
so
marked
a
contradiction
between
her
outward
appearance
and
her
intense
absorption
in
such
a
subject
as
alpine
adventure
he
turned
at
the
door
and
looked
back
sylvia
thesiger
had
raised
her
head
and
was
looking
straight
at
him
thus
their
eyes
met
and
did
more
than
meet
chayne
surprised
as
he
had
been
by
the
book
which
she
was
reading
was
almost
startled
by
the
gentle
and
rather
wistful
beauty
of
the
face
which
she
now
showed
to
him
he
had
been
prepared
at
the
best
for
a
fresh
edition
of
the
mother
worn
and
feverish
prettiness
what
he
saw
was
distinct
in
quality
it
seemed
to
him
that
an
actual
sympathy
and
friendliness
looked
out
from
her
dark
and
quiet
eyes
as
though
by
instinct
she
understood
with
what
an
eager
exultation
he
set
out
upon
his
holiday
sylvia
indeed
living
as
she
did
within
herself
was
inclined
to
naturally
and
chayne
was
of
the
type
to
which
to
some
extent
through
contrast
with
the
run
of
her
acquaintance
she
gave
a
high
place
in
her
thoughts
a
spare
tall
man
and
clean
of
feature
with
a
sufficient
depth
of
shoulder
and
wonderfully
light
of
foot
he
had
claimed
her
eyes
the
moment
that
he
entered
the
buffet
covertly
she
had
watched
him
and
covertly
she
had
sympathized
with
the
keen
enjoyment
which
his
brown
face
betrayed
she
had
no
doubts
in
her
mind
as
to
the
intention
of
his
holiday
and
as
their
eyes
met
now
involuntarily
a
smile
began
to
hesitate
upon
her
lips
then
she
became
aware
of
the
buffet
and
her
ignorance
of
the
man
at
whom
she
looked
and
with
a
sudden
mortification
of
her
own
appearance
her
face
flushed
and
she
lowered
it
again
somewhat
quickly
to
the
pages
of
her
book
but
it
was
as
though
for
a
second
they
had
spoken
chayne
however
forgot
sylvia
thesiger
as
the
train
moved
on
to
le
fayet
he
was
thinking
only
of
the
plans
which
he
had
made
of
the
new
expeditions
which
were
to
be
undertaken
of
his
friend
john
lattery
and
his
guide
michel
revailloud
who
would
be
waiting
for
him
upon
the
platform
of
chamonix
he
had
seen
neither
of
them
for
four
years
the
electric
train
carried
the
travelers
up
from
le
fayet
the
and
peaks
came
into
view
the
glacier
des
bossons
shot
out
a
tongue
of
blue
ice
almost
to
the
edge
of
the
railway
track
and
a
few
minutes
afterward
the
train
stopped
at
the
platform
of
chamonix
chayne
jumped
down
from
his
carriage
and
at
once
suffered
the
first
of
his
disappointments
michel
revailloud
was
on
the
platform
to
meet
him
but
it
was
a
michel
revailloud
whom
he
hardly
knew
a
michel
revailloud
grown
very
old
revailloud
was
only
years
of
age
but
during
chayne
absence
the
hardships
of
his
life
had
taken
their
toll
of
his
vigor
remorselessly
instead
of
the
upright
active
figure
which
chayne
so
well
remembered
he
saw
in
front
of
him
a
little
man
with
bowed
shoulders
eyes
and
a
withered
face
seamed
with
tiny
wrinkles
at
this
moment
however
michel
pleasure
at
once
more
seeing
his
old
patron
gave
to
him
at
all
events
some
look
of
his
former
alertness
and
as
the
two
men
shook
hands
he
cried
monsieur
but
i
am
glad
to
see
you
you
have
been
too
long
away
from
chamonix
but
you
have
not
changed
no
you
have
not
changed
in
his
voice
there
was
without
doubt
a
note
of
wistfulness
i
would
i
could
say
as
much
for
myself
that
regret
was
as
audible
to
chayne
as
though
it
had
been
uttered
but
he
closed
his
ears
to
it
he
began
to
talk
eagerly
of
his
plans
there
were
familiar
peaks
to
be
climbed
again
and
some
new
expeditions
to
be
attempted
i
thought
we
might
try
a
new
route
up
the
aiguille
sans
nom
he
suggested
and
michel
assented
but
slowly
without
the
old
heartiness
and
without
that
light
in
his
face
which
the
suggestion
of
something
new
used
always
to
kindle
but
again
chayne
shut
his
ears
i
was
very
lucky
to
find
you
here
he
went
on
cheerily
i
wrote
so
late
that
i
hardly
hoped
for
it
michel
replied
with
some
embarrassment
i
do
not
climb
with
every
one
monsieur
i
hoped
perhaps
that
one
of
my
old
patrons
would
want
me
so
i
waited
chayne
looked
round
the
platform
for
his
friend
and
monsieur
lattery
he
asked
the
guide
face
lit
up
monsieur
lattery
is
he
coming
too
it
will
be
the
old
days
once
more
coming
he
is
here
now
he
wrote
to
me
from
zermatt
that
he
would
be
here
revailloud
shook
his
head
he
is
not
in
chamonix
monsieur
chayne
experienced
his
second
disappointment
that
morning
and
it
quite
chilled
him
he
had
come
prepared
to
walk
the
heights
like
a
god
in
the
perfection
of
enjoyment
for
just
six
weeks
and
here
was
his
guide
grown
old
and
his
friend
the
comrade
of
so
many
climbs
so
many
bivouacs
above
the
had
failed
to
keep
his
tryst
perhaps
there
will
be
a
letter
from
him
at
couttet
said
chayne
and
the
two
men
walked
through
the
streets
to
the
hotel
there
was
no
letter
but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
a
telegram
chayne
tore
it
open
yes
it
from
lattery
he
said
as
he
glanced
first
at
the
signature
then
he
read
the
telegram
and
his
face
grew
very
grave
lattery
telegraphed
from
courmayeur
the
italian
village
just
across
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
starting
now
by
col
du
géant
and
col
des
nantillons
the
col
du
géant
is
the
most
frequented
pass
across
the
chain
and
no
doubt
the
easiest
once
past
its
great
the
glacier
leads
without
difficulty
to
the
montanvert
hotel
and
chamonix
but
the
col
des
nantillons
is
another
affair
having
passed
the
and
when
within
two
hours
of
the
montanvert
lattery
had
turned
to
the
left
and
had
made
for
the
great
wall
of
precipitous
rock
which
forms
the
western
side
of
the
valley
through
which
the
glacier
du
géant
flows
down
the
wall
from
which
spring
the
peaks
of
the
dent
du
requin
the
aiguille
du
plan
the
aiguille
de
blaitière
the
grépon
and
the
charmoz
here
and
there
the
ridge
sinks
between
the
peaks
and
one
such
depression
between
the
aiguille
de
blaitière
and
the
aiguille
du
grépon
is
called
the
col
des
nantillons
to
cross
that
pass
to
descend
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
into
that
bay
of
ice
facing
chamonix
which
is
the
glacier
des
nantillons
had
been
lattery
idea
chayne
turned
to
the
porter
when
did
this
come
three
days
ago
the
gravity
on
chayne
face
changed
into
a
deep
distress
party
would
have
slept
out
one
night
certainly
they
would
have
made
a
long
march
from
courmayeur
and
camped
on
the
rocks
at
the
foot
of
the
pass
it
was
likely
enough
that
they
should
have
been
caught
upon
that
by
night
upon
the
second
day
the
had
never
been
ascended
and
the
few
who
had
descended
it
bore
ample
testimony
to
its
difficulties
but
a
third
night
no
lattery
should
have
been
in
chamonix
yesterday
without
a
doubt
he
would
not
indeed
have
food
for
three
nights
and
days
chayne
translated
the
telegram
into
french
and
read
it
out
to
michel
revailloud
the
col
des
nantillons
said
michel
with
a
shake
of
the
head
and
chayne
saw
the
fear
which
he
felt
himself
looking
out
from
his
guide
eyes
it
is
possible
said
michel
that
monsieur
lattery
did
not
start
after
all
he
would
have
telegraphed
again
yes
michel
agreed
the
weather
has
been
fine
too
there
have
been
no
fogs
monsieur
lattery
could
not
have
lost
his
way
hardly
in
a
fog
on
the
glacier
du
géant
replied
chayne
michel
revailloud
caught
at
some
other
possibility
of
course
some
small
accident
a
sprained
ankle
may
have
detained
him
at
the
hut
on
the
col
du
géant
such
things
have
happened
it
will
be
as
well
to
telegraph
to
courmayeur
why
that
true
said
chayne
and
as
they
walked
to
the
he
argued
more
to
convince
himself
than
michel
revailloud
it
very
likely
some
quite
small
accident
a
sprained
ankle
but
the
moment
after
he
had
sent
the
telegram
and
when
he
and
michel
stood
again
outside
the
the
fear
which
was
in
him
claimed
utterance
the
col
des
nantillons
is
a
bad
place
michel
that
the
truth
had
lattery
been
detained
in
the
hut
he
would
have
found
means
to
send
us
word
in
weather
like
this
that
hut
would
be
crowded
every
night
every
day
there
would
be
some
one
coming
from
courmayeur
to
chamonix
no
i
am
afraid
of
the
steep
slabs
of
that
and
michael
revailloud
said
slowly
i
too
monsieur
it
is
a
bad
place
the
col
des
nantillons
it
is
not
a
quick
way
or
a
good
way
to
anywhere
and
it
is
very
dangerous
and
yet
i
am
not
sure
monsieur
lattery
was
very
safe
on
rocks
ice
that
is
another
thing
but
he
would
be
on
rock
it
was
evident
that
michel
was
in
doubt
but
it
seemed
that
chayne
could
not
force
himself
to
share
it
you
had
better
get
quietly
together
what
guides
you
can
michel
he
said
by
the
time
a
rescue
party
is
made
up
the
answer
will
have
come
from
courmayeur
chayne
walked
slowly
back
to
the
hotel
all
those
eager
anticipations
which
had
so
shortened
his
journey
this
morning
which
during
the
last
two
years
had
so
often
raised
before
his
eyes
through
the
shimmering
heat
of
the
red
sea
cool
visions
of
and
sharp
spires
of
rock
had
crumbled
and
left
him
desolate
anticipations
of
disaster
had
taken
their
place
he
waited
in
the
garden
of
the
hotel
at
a
spot
whence
he
could
command
the
door
and
the
little
street
leading
down
to
it
but
for
an
hour
no
messenger
came
from
the
then
remembering
that
a
long
sad
work
might
be
before
him
he
went
into
the
hotel
and
breakfasted
it
was
twelve
and
the
room
was
full
he
was
shown
a
place
amongst
the
other
newcomers
at
one
of
the
long
tables
and
he
did
not
notice
that
sylvia
thesiger
sat
beside
him
he
heard
her
timid
request
for
the
salt
and
passed
it
to
her
but
he
did
not
speak
he
did
not
turn
and
when
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
left
the
room
he
had
no
idea
who
had
sat
beside
him
nor
did
he
see
the
shadow
of
disappointment
on
her
face
it
was
not
until
later
in
the
afternoon
when
at
last
the
blue
envelope
was
brought
to
him
he
tore
it
open
and
read
the
answer
of
the
hotel
proprietor
at
courmayeur
lattery
left
four
days
ago
with
one
guide
for
col
du
géant
he
was
standing
by
the
door
of
the
hotel
and
looking
up
he
saw
michel
revailloud
and
a
small
band
of
guides
all
of
whom
carried
and
some
on
their
backs
and
ropes
come
tramping
down
the
street
toward
him
michel
revailloud
came
close
to
his
side
and
spoke
with
excitement
he
has
been
seen
monsieur
it
must
have
been
monsieur
lattery
with
his
one
guide
there
were
two
of
them
and
chayne
interrupted
him
quickly
yes
there
were
two
he
said
glancing
at
his
telegram
where
were
they
seen
high
up
monsieur
on
the
rocks
of
the
blaitiere
here
jules
and
in
obedience
to
michel
summons
a
young
guide
stepped
out
from
the
rest
he
lifted
his
hat
and
told
his
story
it
was
on
the
mer
de
glace
monsieur
the
day
before
yesterday
i
was
bringing
a
party
back
from
the
jardin
and
just
by
the
moulin
i
saw
two
men
very
high
up
on
the
cliffs
of
the
blaitiere
i
was
astonished
for
i
had
never
seen
any
one
upon
those
cliffs
before
but
i
was
quite
sure
none
of
my
party
could
see
them
it
is
true
but
i
saw
them
clearly
they
were
perhaps
two
hundred
feet
below
the
ridge
between
the
blaitiere
and
the
grépon
and
to
the
left
of
the
what
time
was
this
four
in
the
afternoon
yes
said
chayne
the
story
was
borne
out
by
the
telegram
leaving
courmayeur
early
lattery
and
his
guide
would
have
slept
the
night
on
the
rocks
at
the
foot
of
the
blaitiere
they
would
have
climbed
all
the
next
day
and
at
four
had
reached
within
two
hundred
feet
of
the
ridge
within
two
hundred
feet
of
safety
somewhere
within
those
last
two
hundred
feet
the
fatal
slip
had
been
made
or
perhaps
a
stone
had
fallen
for
how
long
did
you
watch
them
asked
chayne
for
a
few
minutes
only
my
party
was
anxious
to
get
back
to
chamonix
but
they
seemed
in
no
difficulty
monsieur
they
were
going
well
chayne
shook
his
head
at
the
hopeful
words
and
handed
his
telegram
to
michel
revailloud
the
day
before
yesterday
they
were
on
the
rocks
of
the
blaitière
he
said
i
think
we
had
better
go
up
to
the
mer
de
glace
and
look
for
them
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
monsieur
i
have
eight
guides
here
and
two
will
follow
in
the
evening
when
they
come
home
we
will
send
three
of
them
as
a
precaution
up
the
mer
de
glace
but
i
do
not
think
they
will
find
monsieur
lattery
there
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
believe
monsieur
lattery
has
made
the
first
passage
of
the
col
des
nantillons
from
the
east
he
said
with
a
peculiar
solemnity
i
think
we
must
look
for
them
on
the
western
side
of
the
pass
in
the
crevasses
of
the
glacier
des
nantillons
surely
not
cried
chayne
true
the
glacier
des
nantillons
in
places
was
steep
true
there
were
the
séracs
those
great
slabs
and
pinnacles
of
ice
set
up
on
end
and
tottering
high
above
where
the
glacier
curved
over
a
brow
of
rock
and
broke
one
of
them
might
have
fallen
but
lattery
and
he
had
so
often
ascended
and
descended
that
glacier
on
the
way
to
the
charmoz
and
the
grépon
and
the
plan
he
could
not
believe
his
friend
had
come
to
harm
that
way
michel
however
clung
to
his
opinion
the
worst
part
of
the
climb
was
over
he
argued
the
very
worst
pitch
monsieur
is
at
the
very
beginning
when
you
leave
the
glacier
and
then
it
is
very
bad
again
half
way
up
when
you
descend
into
a
gully
but
monsieur
lattery
was
very
safe
on
rock
and
having
got
so
high
i
think
he
would
have
climbed
the
last
rocks
with
his
guide
michel
spoke
with
so
much
certainty
that
even
in
the
face
of
his
telegram
in
the
face
of
the
story
which
jules
had
told
hope
sprang
up
within
chayne
heart
then
he
may
be
still
up
there
on
some
ledge
he
would
surely
not
have
slipped
on
the
glacier
des
nantillons
that
hope
however
was
not
shared
by
michel
revailloud
there
is
very
little
snow
this
year
he
said
the
glaciers
are
uncovered
as
i
have
never
seen
them
in
all
my
life
everywhere
it
is
ice
ice
ice
monsieur
lattery
had
only
one
guide
with
him
and
he
was
not
so
sure
on
ice
i
am
afraid
monsieur
that
he
slipped
out
of
his
steps
on
the
glacier
des
nantillons
and
dragged
his
guide
with
him
exclaimed
chayne
his
heart
rather
than
his
judgment
protested
against
the
argument
it
seemed
to
him
disloyal
to
believe
it
a
man
should
not
slip
from
his
steps
on
the
glacier
des
nantillons
he
turned
toward
the
door
very
well
he
said
send
three
guides
up
the
mer
de
glace
we
will
go
up
to
the
glacier
des
nantillons
he
went
up
to
his
room
fetched
his
and
a
new
with
the
twist
of
red
in
its
strands
and
came
down
again
the
rumor
of
an
accident
had
spread
a
throng
of
tourists
stood
about
the
door
and
surrounded
the
group
of
guides
plying
them
with
questions
one
or
two
asked
chayne
as
he
came
out
on
what
peak
the
accident
had
happened
he
did
not
reply
he
turned
to
michel
revailloud
and
forgetful
for
the
moment
that
he
was
in
chamonix
he
uttered
the
word
so
familiar
in
the
high
alps
so
welcome
in
its
sound
michel
he
said
and
the
word
was
the
open
sesame
to
a
chamber
which
he
would
gladly
have
kept
locked
there
was
work
to
do
now
there
would
be
time
afterward
to
remember
too
long
a
time
but
in
spite
of
himself
his
recollections
rushed
tumultuously
upon
him
up
to
these
last
four
years
on
some
day
in
each
july
his
friend
and
he
had
been
wont
to
foregather
at
some
village
in
the
alps
lattery
coming
from
a
government
office
in
whitehall
chayne
now
from
some
garrison
town
in
england
now
from
malta
or
from
alexandria
and
sometimes
from
a
still
farther
dependency
usually
they
had
climbed
together
for
six
weeks
although
there
were
years
when
the
six
weeks
were
extended
to
eight
six
weeks
during
which
they
lived
for
the
most
part
on
the
high
level
of
the
glaciers
sleeping
in
huts
or
mountain
inns
or
beneath
the
stars
and
coming
down
only
for
a
few
hours
now
and
then
into
the
valley
towns
the
months
of
their
comradeship
seemed
to
him
epitomized
in
the
word
the
joy
and
inspiration
of
many
a
hard
climb
came
back
made
bitter
with
regret
for
things
very
pleasant
and
now
done
with
forever
nights
on
some
high
ledge
sheltered
with
rocks
and
set
in
the
pale
glimmer
of
with
a
fire
of
brushwood
lighting
up
the
faces
of
comrades
half
hours
passed
in
rock
chimneys
wedged
overhead
by
a
boulder
or
in
beneath
a
bulge
of
ice
when
one
man
struggled
above
out
of
sight
and
the
rest
of
the
party
crouched
below
with
what
security
it
might
waiting
for
the
cheery
cry
geht
the
last
scramble
to
the
summit
of
a
virgin
peak
the
swift
glissade
down
the
final
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
with
the
lights
of
the
village
twinkling
below
his
memories
tramped
by
him
fast
and
always
in
the
heart
of
them
his
friend
face
shone
before
his
eyes
chayne
stood
for
a
moment
dazed
and
bewildered
there
rose
up
in
his
mind
that
first
helpless
question
of
distress
why
and
while
he
stood
his
face
puzzled
and
greatly
troubled
there
fell
upon
his
ears
from
close
at
hand
a
simple
message
of
sympathy
uttered
in
a
whisper
gentle
but
distinct
i
am
very
sorry
chayne
looked
up
it
was
the
overdressed
girl
of
the
annemasse
buffet
the
girl
who
had
seemed
to
understand
then
who
seemed
to
understand
now
he
raised
his
hat
to
her
with
a
sense
of
gratitude
then
he
followed
the
guides
and
went
up
among
the
trees
toward
the
glacier
des
nantillons
chapter
iii
the
finding
of
john
lattery
the
rescue
party
marched
upward
between
the
trees
with
the
measured
pace
of
experience
strength
which
would
be
needed
above
the
was
not
to
be
wasted
on
the
lower
slopes
but
on
the
other
hand
no
halts
were
made
steadily
the
file
of
men
turned
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
the
zigzags
of
the
forest
path
multiplied
behind
them
the
zigzags
increased
in
length
the
trees
became
sparse
the
rescue
party
came
out
upon
the
great
plateau
at
the
foot
of
the
peaks
called
the
plan
des
aiguilles
and
stopped
at
the
mountain
inn
built
upon
its
brow
just
over
chamonix
the
evening
had
come
below
them
the
mists
were
creeping
along
the
hillsides
and
blotting
the
valley
out
we
will
stop
here
said
michel
revailloud
as
he
stepped
on
to
the
little
platform
of
earth
in
front
of
the
door
if
we
start
again
at
midnight
we
shall
be
on
the
glacier
at
daybreak
we
can
not
search
the
glacier
des
nantillons
in
the
dark
chayne
agreed
reluctantly
he
would
have
liked
to
push
on
if
only
to
lull
thought
by
the
monotony
of
their
march
moreover
during
these
last
two
hours
some
faint
rushlight
of
hope
had
been
kindled
in
his
mind
which
made
all
delay
irksome
he
himself
would
not
believe
that
his
friend
john
lattery
with
all
his
skill
his
experience
had
slipped
from
his
like
any
tyro
michel
on
the
other
hand
would
not
believe
that
he
had
fallen
from
the
upper
rocks
of
the
blaitière
on
the
far
side
of
the
from
these
two
disbeliefs
his
hope
had
sprung
it
was
possible
that
either
lattery
or
his
guide
lay
disabled
but
alive
and
tended
as
well
as
might
be
by
his
companion
on
some
insecure
ledge
of
that
a
falling
stone
a
slip
checked
by
the
rope
might
have
left
either
hurt
but
still
living
it
was
true
that
for
two
nights
and
a
day
the
two
men
must
have
already
hung
upon
their
ledge
that
a
third
night
was
to
follow
still
such
endurance
had
been
known
in
the
annals
of
the
alps
and
lattery
was
a
hard
strong
man
a
girl
came
from
the
chalet
and
told
him
that
his
dinner
was
ready
chayne
forced
himself
to
eat
and
stepped
out
again
on
to
the
platform
a
door
opened
and
closed
behind
him
michel
revailloud
came
from
the
guides
quarters
at
the
end
of
the
chalet
and
stood
beside
him
in
the
darkness
saying
nothing
since
sympathy
taught
him
to
be
silent
and
when
he
moved
moving
with
great
gentleness
i
am
glad
michel
that
we
waited
here
since
we
had
to
wait
said
chayne
this
chalet
is
new
to
you
monsieur
it
has
been
built
while
you
were
away
yes
and
therefore
it
has
no
associations
and
no
memories
its
bare
whitewashed
walls
have
no
stories
to
tell
me
of
cheery
nights
on
the
eve
of
a
new
climb
when
he
and
i
sat
together
for
a
while
and
talked
eagerly
of
the
prospects
of
the
words
ceased
chayne
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
wooden
rail
the
mists
in
the
valley
below
had
been
swept
away
overhead
the
stars
shone
out
of
an
ebony
sky
very
bright
as
on
some
clear
winter
night
of
frost
and
of
all
that
gigantic
amphitheater
of
mountains
which
circled
behind
them
from
right
to
left
there
was
hardly
a
hint
perhaps
here
some
extra
cube
of
darkness
showed
where
a
pinnacle
soared
or
there
a
vague
whiteness
glimmered
where
a
high
glacier
hung
against
the
cliff
but
for
the
rest
the
darkness
hid
the
mountains
a
cold
wind
blew
out
of
the
east
and
chayne
shivered
you
are
cold
monsieur
said
michel
it
is
your
first
night
no
i
am
not
cold
chayne
replied
in
a
low
and
quiet
voice
but
i
am
thinking
it
will
be
deadly
cold
up
there
in
the
darkness
on
the
rocks
of
the
blaitiere
michel
answered
him
in
the
same
quiet
voice
on
that
broad
open
plateau
both
men
spoke
indeed
as
though
they
were
in
a
sick
chamber
while
you
were
away
monsieur
three
men
without
food
sat
through
a
night
on
a
steep
behind
us
high
up
on
the
aiguille
du
plan
as
high
up
as
the
rocks
of
the
blaitiere
and
not
one
of
them
came
to
any
harm
i
know
i
read
of
it
said
chayne
but
he
gathered
little
comfort
from
the
argument
michel
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
a
pipe
you
do
not
smoke
any
more
he
asked
it
is
a
good
thing
to
smoke
i
had
forgotten
said
chayne
he
filled
his
pipe
and
then
took
a
fuse
from
his
no
do
waste
it
cried
michel
quickly
before
he
could
strike
it
i
remember
your
fuses
monsieur
michel
struck
a
sulphur
match
and
held
it
as
it
spluttered
and
frizzled
in
the
hollow
of
his
great
hands
the
flame
burnt
up
he
held
it
first
to
chayne
and
then
to
his
own
and
for
a
moment
his
face
was
lit
with
the
red
glow
its
age
thus
revealed
and
framed
in
the
darkness
shocked
chayne
even
at
this
moment
more
than
it
had
done
on
the
platform
at
chamonix
not
merely
were
its
deep
lines
shown
up
but
all
the
old
humor
and
alertness
had
gone
the
face
had
grown
and
spiritless
then
the
match
went
out
chayne
leaned
upon
the
rail
and
looked
downward
a
long
way
below
him
in
the
clear
darkness
of
the
valley
the
lights
of
chamonix
shone
bright
and
very
small
chayne
had
never
seen
them
before
so
straight
beneath
him
as
he
looked
he
began
to
notice
them
as
he
noticed
them
more
and
more
they
took
a
definite
shape
he
rose
upright
and
pointing
downward
with
one
hand
he
said
in
a
whisper
a
whisper
of
awe
do
you
see
michel
do
you
see
the
great
main
thoroughfare
ran
in
a
straight
line
eastward
through
the
town
and
across
it
intersecting
it
at
the
little
square
where
the
guides
gather
of
an
evening
lay
the
other
broad
straight
road
from
the
church
across
the
river
along
those
two
roads
the
lights
burned
most
brightly
and
thus
there
had
emerged
before
chayne
eyes
a
great
golden
cross
it
grew
clearer
and
clearer
as
he
looked
he
looked
away
and
then
back
again
and
now
it
leapt
to
view
he
could
not
hide
it
from
his
sight
a
great
cross
of
light
lying
upon
the
dark
bosom
of
the
valley
do
you
see
michel
yes
the
answer
came
back
very
steadily
but
so
it
was
last
night
and
last
year
those
three
men
on
the
plan
had
it
before
their
eyes
all
night
it
is
no
sign
of
disaster
for
a
moment
he
was
silent
and
then
he
added
timidly
if
you
look
for
a
sign
monsieur
there
is
a
better
one
chayne
turned
toward
michel
in
the
darkness
rather
quickly
as
we
set
out
from
the
hotel
michel
continued
there
was
a
young
girl
upon
the
steps
with
a
very
sweet
and
gentle
face
she
spoke
to
you
monsieur
no
doubt
she
told
you
that
her
prayers
would
be
with
you
no
michel
chayne
replied
and
though
the
darkness
hid
his
face
michel
knew
that
he
smiled
she
did
not
promise
me
her
prayers
she
simply
said
am
sorry
michel
revailloud
was
silent
for
a
little
while
and
when
he
spoke
again
he
spoke
very
wistfully
one
might
almost
have
said
that
there
was
a
note
of
envy
in
his
voice
well
that
is
still
something
monsieur
you
are
very
lonely
is
it
not
so
you
came
back
here
after
many
years
eager
with
hopes
and
plans
and
not
thinking
at
all
of
disappointments
and
the
disappointments
have
come
and
the
hopes
are
all
fallen
is
not
that
so
too
well
it
is
something
monsieur
i
who
am
lonely
too
and
an
old
man
besides
so
that
i
can
not
mend
my
loneliness
i
tell
you
it
is
something
that
there
is
a
young
girl
down
there
with
a
sweet
and
gentle
face
who
is
sorry
for
you
who
perhaps
is
looking
up
from
among
those
lights
to
where
we
stand
in
the
darkness
at
this
moment
but
it
seemed
that
chayne
did
not
hear
or
if
he
heard
that
he
paid
no
heed
and
michel
knocking
the
tobacco
from
his
pipe
said
you
will
do
well
to
sleep
we
may
have
a
long
day
before
us
and
he
walked
away
to
the
guides
quarters
but
chayne
could
not
sleep
hope
and
doubt
fought
too
strongly
within
him
wrestling
for
the
life
of
his
friend
at
twelve
michel
knocked
upon
his
door
chayne
got
up
from
his
bed
at
once
drew
on
his
boots
and
breakfasted
at
half
past
the
rescue
party
set
out
following
a
rough
path
through
a
wilderness
of
boulders
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
it
was
still
dark
when
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
glacier
and
they
sat
down
and
waited
in
a
little
while
the
sky
broke
in
the
east
a
twilight
dimly
revealed
the
hills
michel
blew
out
the
lantern
the
blurred
figures
of
the
guides
took
shape
and
outline
and
silently
the
morning
dawned
upon
the
world
the
guides
moved
on
to
the
glacier
and
spread
over
it
ascending
as
they
searched
you
see
monsieur
there
is
very
little
snow
this
year
said
michel
chipping
steps
so
that
he
and
chayne
might
round
the
corner
of
a
wide
crevasse
yes
but
it
does
not
follow
that
he
slipped
said
chayne
hotly
for
he
was
beginning
to
resent
that
explanation
as
an
imputation
against
his
friend
slowly
the
party
moved
upward
over
the
great
slope
of
ice
into
the
recess
looking
for
steps
abruptly
ending
above
a
crevasse
or
for
signs
of
an
avalanche
they
came
level
with
the
lower
end
of
a
long
rib
of
rock
which
crops
out
from
the
ice
and
lengthwise
bisects
the
glacier
here
the
search
ended
for
a
while
the
rib
of
rocks
is
the
natural
path
and
the
guides
climbed
it
quickly
they
came
to
the
upper
glacier
and
spread
out
once
more
roped
in
couples
they
were
now
well
within
the
great
amphitheater
on
their
left
the
cliffs
of
the
charmoz
overlapped
them
on
the
right
the
rocks
of
the
blaitière
for
an
hour
they
advanced
cutting
steps
since
the
glacier
was
steep
and
then
from
the
center
of
the
glacier
a
cry
rang
out
chayne
at
the
end
of
the
line
upon
the
right
looked
across
a
little
way
in
front
of
the
two
men
who
had
shouted
something
dark
lay
upon
the
ice
chayne
who
was
with
michel
revailloud
called
to
him
and
began
hurriedly
to
scratch
steps
diagonally
toward
the
object
take
care
monsieur
cried
michel
chayne
paid
no
heed
coming
up
from
behind
on
the
side
he
passed
his
guide
and
took
the
lead
he
could
tell
now
what
the
dark
object
was
for
every
now
and
then
a
breath
of
wind
caught
it
and
whirled
it
about
the
ice
it
was
a
hat
he
raised
his
ax
to
slice
a
step
and
a
gust
of
wind
stronger
than
the
others
lifted
the
hat
sent
it
rolling
and
skipping
down
the
glacier
lifted
it
again
and
gently
dropped
it
at
his
feet
he
stooped
down
and
picked
it
up
it
was
a
soft
hat
of
dark
gray
felt
in
the
crown
there
was
the
name
of
an
english
maker
there
was
something
more
too
there
were
two
initials
chayne
turned
to
michel
revailloud
you
were
right
michel
he
said
solemnly
my
friend
has
made
the
first
passage
of
the
col
des
nantillons
from
the
east
the
party
moved
forward
again
watching
with
redoubled
vigilance
for
some
spot
in
the
glacier
some
spot
above
a
crevasse
to
which
descended
and
from
which
they
did
not
lead
down
and
three
hundred
yards
beyond
a
second
cry
rang
out
a
guide
was
standing
on
the
lower
edge
of
a
great
crevasse
with
a
hand
upheld
above
his
head
the
searchers
converged
quickly
upon
him
chayne
hurried
forward
plying
the
pick
of
his
ax
as
never
in
his
life
had
he
plied
it
had
the
guide
come
upon
the
actual
place
where
the
accident
took
place
he
asked
himself
but
before
he
reached
the
spot
his
pace
slackened
and
he
stood
still
he
had
no
longer
any
doubt
his
friend
and
his
friend
guide
were
not
lying
upon
any
ledge
of
the
rocks
of
the
aiguille
de
blaitière
they
were
not
waiting
for
any
succor
on
the
glacier
a
broad
track
littered
with
blocks
of
ice
stretched
upward
in
a
straight
line
from
the
upper
lip
of
the
crevasse
to
the
great
on
the
where
the
huge
slabs
and
pinnacles
of
ice
twisted
into
monstrous
shapes
like
a
sea
suddenly
frozen
when
a
tempest
was
at
its
height
stood
marshaled
in
serried
rows
they
stood
waiting
upon
the
sun
one
of
them
melted
at
the
base
had
crashed
down
the
slope
bursting
into
huge
fragments
as
it
fell
and
cleaving
a
groove
even
in
that
hard
glacier
chayne
went
forward
and
stopped
at
the
guide
side
on
the
lower
edge
of
the
crevasse
beyond
the
chasm
the
ice
rose
in
a
blue
straight
wall
for
some
three
feet
and
the
upper
edge
was
all
crushed
and
battered
and
then
the
track
of
the
falling
sérac
ended
it
had
poured
into
the
crevasse
the
guide
pointed
to
the
left
of
the
track
do
you
see
monsieur
those
steps
which
come
downward
across
the
glacier
and
stop
exactly
where
the
track
meets
them
they
do
not
go
on
on
the
other
side
of
the
track
monsieur
chayne
saw
clearly
enough
the
two
men
had
been
descending
the
glacier
in
the
afternoon
the
avalanche
had
fallen
and
swept
them
down
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
and
peered
into
the
crevasse
the
walls
of
the
chasm
descended
smooth
and
precipitous
changing
in
gradual
shades
and
color
from
pale
transparent
green
to
the
darkest
blue
until
all
color
was
lost
in
darkness
he
bent
his
head
and
shouted
into
the
depths
lattery
lattery
and
only
his
voice
came
back
to
him
cavernous
and
hollow
he
shouted
again
and
then
he
heard
michel
revailloud
saying
solemnly
behind
him
yes
they
are
here
suddenly
chayne
turned
round
moved
by
a
fierce
throb
of
anger
it
not
true
you
see
he
cried
he
did
slip
out
of
his
steps
and
drag
his
guide
down
with
him
you
were
wrong
michel
michel
was
standing
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
yes
monsieur
i
was
quite
wrong
he
said
gently
he
turned
to
a
big
and
strong
man
françois
will
you
put
on
the
rope
and
go
down
they
knotted
the
rope
securely
about
françois
waist
and
he
took
his
in
his
hand
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
crevasse
with
his
legs
dangling
turned
over
upon
his
face
and
said
when
i
pull
the
rope
haul
in
gently
they
lowered
him
carefully
down
for
sixty
feet
and
at
that
depth
the
rope
slackened
françois
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
crevasse
for
a
few
moments
they
watched
the
rope
move
this
way
and
that
and
then
there
came
a
definite
pull
he
has
found
them
said
michel
some
of
the
guides
lined
out
with
the
rope
in
their
hands
chayne
took
his
position
in
the
front
at
the
head
of
the
line
and
nearest
to
the
crevasse
the
pull
upon
the
rope
was
repeated
and
slowly
the
men
began
to
haul
it
in
it
did
not
occur
to
chayne
that
the
weight
upon
the
rope
was
heavy
one
question
filled
his
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
had
françois
found
his
friend
what
news
would
he
bring
of
them
when
he
came
again
up
to
the
light
françois
voice
was
heard
now
faintly
calling
from
the
depths
but
what
he
said
could
not
be
heard
the
line
of
men
hauled
in
the
rope
more
and
more
quickly
and
then
suddenly
stopped
and
drew
it
in
very
gently
for
they
could
now
hear
what
françois
said
it
was
but
one
word
persistently
repeated
gently
gently
and
so
gently
they
drew
him
up
toward
the
mouth
of
the
crevasse
chayne
was
standing
too
far
back
to
see
down
beyond
the
edge
but
he
could
hear
françois
ax
clattering
against
the
and
the
grating
of
his
boots
michel
who
was
kneeling
at
the
edge
of
the
chasm
held
up
his
hand
and
the
men
upon
the
rope
ceased
to
haul
in
a
minute
or
two
he
lowered
it
gently
he
said
gently
gazing
downward
with
a
queer
absorption
chayne
began
to
hear
françois
labored
breathing
and
then
suddenly
at
the
edge
of
the
crevasse
he
saw
appear
the
hair
of
a
man
head
up
with
him
cried
a
guide
there
was
a
quick
strong
pull
upon
the
rope
and
out
of
the
chasm
above
the
white
level
of
the
glacier
there
appeared
a
face
not
françois
face
but
the
face
of
a
dead
man
suddenly
it
rose
into
the
colorless
light
pallid
and
with
open
sightless
eyes
and
a
dropped
jaw
and
one
horrid
splash
of
color
on
the
left
forehead
where
blood
had
frozen
it
was
the
face
of
friend
john
lattery
and
in
a
way
most
grotesque
and
horrible
it
bobbed
and
nodded
at
him
as
though
the
neck
was
broken
and
the
man
yet
lived
when
françois
just
below
cried
gently
gently
it
seemed
that
the
dead
man
mouth
was
speaking
chayne
uttered
a
cry
then
a
deathly
sickness
overcame
him
he
dropped
the
rope
staggered
a
little
way
off
like
a
drunken
man
and
sat
down
upon
the
ice
with
his
head
between
his
hands
some
while
later
a
man
came
to
him
and
said
we
are
ready
monsieur
chayne
returned
to
the
crevasse
lattery
guide
had
been
raised
from
the
crevasse
both
bodies
had
been
wrapped
in
sacks
and
cords
had
been
fixed
about
their
legs
the
rescue
party
dragged
the
bodies
down
the
glacier
to
the
path
and
placing
them
upon
doors
taken
from
a
chalet
carried
them
down
to
chamonix
on
the
way
down
françois
talked
for
a
while
to
michel
revailloud
who
in
his
turn
fell
back
to
where
at
the
end
of
the
procession
chayne
walked
alone
monsieur
he
said
and
chayne
looked
at
him
with
dull
eyes
like
a
man
dazed
there
is
something
which
françois
noticed
which
he
wished
me
to
tell
you
françois
is
a
good
lad
he
wishes
you
to
know
that
your
friend
died
at
once
there
was
no
sign
of
a
movement
he
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
crevasse
in
some
snow
which
was
quite
smooth
the
guide
he
had
kicked
a
little
with
his
feet
in
the
snow
but
your
friend
had
died
at
once
thank
you
said
chayne
without
the
least
emotion
in
his
voice
but
he
walked
with
uneven
steps
at
times
he
staggered
like
one
overdone
and
very
tired
but
once
or
twice
he
said
as
though
he
were
dimly
aware
that
he
had
his
friend
reputation
to
defend
you
see
he
did
slip
on
the
ice
michel
you
were
quite
wrong
it
was
the
avalanche
it
was
no
fault
of
his
i
was
wrong
said
michel
and
he
took
chayne
by
the
arm
lest
he
should
fall
and
these
two
men
came
long
after
the
others
into
chamonix
chapter
iv
jarvice
the
news
of
lattery
death
was
telegraphed
to
england
on
the
same
evening
it
appeared
the
next
morning
under
a
conspicuous
in
the
daily
newspapers
and
sidney
jarvice
read
the
item
in
the
pullman
car
as
he
traveled
from
brighton
to
his
office
in
london
he
removed
his
big
cigar
from
his
fat
red
lips
and
became
absorbed
in
thought
the
train
rushed
past
hassocks
and
three
bridges
and
east
croydon
jarvice
never
once
looked
at
his
newspaper
again
the
big
cigar
of
which
the
costliness
was
proclaimed
by
the
gold
band
about
its
middle
had
long
since
gone
out
and
for
him
the
train
came
quite
unexpectedly
to
a
stop
at
the
ticket
platform
on
battersea
bridge
jarvice
was
a
florid
person
in
his
looks
and
in
his
dress
it
was
in
accordance
with
his
floridness
that
he
always
retained
the
gold
band
about
his
cigar
while
he
smoked
it
he
was
a
man
of
middle
age
with
thick
black
hair
a
red
broad
face
little
bright
black
eyes
a
black
mustache
and
rather
prominent
teeth
he
was
short
and
stout
and
drew
attention
to
his
figure
by
wearing
trousers
adorned
with
a
striking
check
from
victoria
station
he
drove
at
once
to
his
office
in
jermyn
street
a
young
and
clerk
was
already
at
work
in
the
outer
room
i
will
see
no
one
this
morning
maunders
said
jarvice
as
he
pressed
through
very
well
sir
there
are
a
good
number
of
letters
replied
the
clerk
they
must
wait
said
jarvice
and
entering
his
private
room
he
shut
the
door
he
did
not
touch
the
letters
upon
his
table
but
he
went
straight
to
his
bureau
and
unlocking
a
drawer
took
from
it
a
copy
of
the
code
napoleon
he
studied
the
document
carefully
locked
it
up
again
and
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
getting
on
toward
one
he
rang
the
bell
for
his
clerk
maunders
he
said
i
once
asked
you
to
make
some
inquiries
about
a
young
man
called
walter
hine
yes
sir
do
you
remember
what
his
habits
were
where
he
lunched
for
instance
maunders
reflected
for
a
moment
it
a
little
while
ago
sir
since
i
made
the
inquiries
as
far
as
i
remember
he
did
not
lunch
regularly
anywhere
but
he
went
to
the
american
bar
of
the
criterion
restaurant
most
days
for
a
morning
drink
about
one
oh
he
did
you
made
his
acquaintance
of
course
yes
sir
well
you
might
find
him
this
morning
give
him
some
lunch
and
bring
him
round
to
see
me
at
three
see
that
he
is
sober
at
three
accordingly
walter
hine
was
shown
into
the
inner
room
of
jarvice
jarvice
bent
his
bright
eyes
upon
his
visitor
he
saw
a
young
man
with
very
fair
hair
a
narrow
forehead
watery
blue
eyes
and
a
weak
dissipated
face
walter
hine
was
dressed
in
a
cheap
suit
of
tweed
much
the
worse
for
wear
and
he
entered
the
room
with
the
sullen
timidity
of
the
very
shy
moreover
he
was
a
little
unsteady
as
he
walked
as
though
he
had
not
yet
recovered
from
last
intoxication
jarvice
noted
these
points
with
his
quick
glance
but
whether
they
pleased
him
or
not
there
was
no
hint
upon
his
face
will
you
sit
down
he
said
suavely
pointing
to
a
chair
maunders
you
can
go
walter
hine
turned
quickly
as
though
he
would
have
preferred
maunders
to
stay
but
he
let
him
go
jarvice
shut
the
door
carefully
and
walking
across
the
room
stood
over
his
visitor
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
renewed
his
scrutiny
walter
hine
grew
uncomfortable
and
blurted
out
with
a
cockney
twang
maunders
told
me
that
if
i
came
to
see
you
it
might
be
to
my
advantage
i
think
it
will
replied
jarvice
have
you
seen
this
morning
paper
the
then
you
have
probably
not
noticed
that
your
cousin
john
lattery
has
been
killed
in
the
alps
he
handed
his
newspaper
to
hine
who
glanced
at
it
indifferently
well
how
does
that
affect
me
he
asked
it
leaves
you
the
only
heir
to
your
uncle
joseph
hine
at
macon
who
i
believe
is
a
millionaire
joseph
hine
is
domiciled
in
france
and
must
by
french
law
leave
a
certain
portion
of
his
property
to
his
relations
in
other
words
to
you
i
have
taken
some
trouble
to
go
into
the
matter
hine
and
i
find
that
your
share
must
at
the
very
least
amount
to
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
i
know
all
about
that
hine
interrupted
but
as
the
old
brute
acknowledge
me
and
may
live
another
twenty
years
it
not
much
use
to
me
now
well
said
jarvice
smiling
suavely
my
young
friend
that
is
where
i
come
in
walter
hine
looked
up
in
surprise
suspicion
followed
quickly
upon
the
surprise
oh
on
purely
business
terms
of
course
said
jarvice
he
took
a
seat
and
resumed
gaily
now
i
am
by
profession
what
would
you
guess
i
am
a
luckily
for
many
people
i
have
money
and
i
lend
it
i
lend
it
upon
very
easy
terms
i
make
no
secret
of
my
calling
hine
on
the
contrary
i
glory
in
it
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
of
doing
a
great
deal
of
good
in
a
quiet
way
if
i
were
to
show
you
my
books
you
would
realize
that
many
famous
estates
are
only
kept
going
through
my
assistance
and
thus
many
a
farm
laborer
owes
his
daily
bread
to
me
and
never
knows
his
debt
why
should
i
conceal
it
jarvice
turned
toward
his
visitor
with
his
hands
outspread
then
his
voice
dropped
there
is
only
one
thing
i
hide
and
that
hine
is
the
easiness
of
the
terms
on
which
i
advance
my
loans
i
must
hide
that
i
should
have
all
my
profession
against
me
were
it
known
but
you
shall
know
it
mr
hine
he
leaned
forward
and
patted
his
young
friend
upon
the
knee
with
an
air
of
great
benevolence
come
to
business
your
circumstances
are
not
i
think
in
a
very
flourishing
condition
i
should
think
not
said
walter
hine
sullenly
i
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
paid
weekly
three
quid
a
week
do
give
a
fellow
much
chance
of
a
flutter
three
pounds
a
week
ridiculous
cried
jarvice
lifting
up
his
hands
i
am
shocked
really
shocked
but
we
will
alter
all
that
oh
yes
we
will
soon
alter
that
he
sprang
up
briskly
and
unlocking
once
more
the
drawer
in
which
he
kept
his
copy
of
the
code
napoleon
he
took
out
this
time
a
slip
of
paper
he
seated
himself
again
drawing
up
his
chair
to
the
table
will
you
tell
me
hine
whether
these
particulars
are
correct
we
must
be
you
know
oh
yes
he
said
gaily
wagging
his
head
and
cocking
his
bright
little
eyes
at
his
visitor
and
he
began
to
read
aloud
or
rather
paraphrase
the
paper
which
he
held
your
father
inherited
the
same
fortune
as
your
uncle
joseph
hine
but
lost
almost
the
entire
amount
in
speculation
in
middle
life
he
married
your
mother
who
was
forgive
me
if
i
wound
the
delicacy
of
your
feelings
hine
not
quite
his
equal
in
social
position
the
happy
couple
then
took
up
their
residence
in
arcade
street
croydon
where
you
were
born
on
march
years
ago
yes
said
walter
hine
in
croydon
you
passed
your
boyhood
you
were
sent
to
the
public
school
there
but
the
rigorous
discipline
of
school
life
did
not
suit
your
independent
character
thus
did
jarvice
gracefully
paraphrase
the
single
word
expelled
which
was
written
on
his
slip
of
paper
ah
hine
he
cried
smiling
indulgently
at
the
sullen
bemused
weakling
who
sat
before
him
stale
with
his
last
night
drink
you
and
shelley
rebels
sir
rebels
both
well
well
after
you
left
school
at
the
age
of
sixteen
you
pursued
your
studies
in
a
desultory
fashion
at
home
your
father
died
the
following
year
your
mother
two
years
later
you
have
since
lived
in
russell
street
bloomsbury
on
the
income
which
remained
from
your
father
patrimony
three
pounds
a
week
to
be
sure
here
it
is
paid
weekly
by
trustees
appointed
by
your
mother
and
you
have
adopted
none
of
the
liberal
professions
there
we
have
it
i
think
you
seem
to
have
taken
a
lot
of
trouble
to
find
out
my
history
said
walter
hine
suspiciously
business
sir
business
said
jarvice
it
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
add
the
early
bird
you
know
but
he
was
discreet
enough
to
hold
the
words
back
now
let
me
look
to
the
future
which
opens
out
in
a
brighter
prospect
it
is
altogether
absurd
hine
that
a
young
gentleman
who
will
eventually
inherit
a
quarter
of
a
million
should
have
to
scrape
through
meanwhile
on
three
pounds
a
week
i
put
it
on
a
higher
ground
it
is
bad
for
the
state
hine
and
you
and
i
like
good
citizens
of
this
great
empire
must
consider
the
state
when
this
great
fortune
comes
into
your
hands
you
should
already
have
learned
how
to
dispose
of
it
oh
i
could
dispose
of
it
all
right
interrupted
hine
with
a
chuckle
do
you
worry
your
head
about
that
jarvice
laughed
heartily
at
the
joke
walter
hine
could
not
but
think
that
he
had
made
a
very
witty
remark
he
began
to
thaw
into
something
like
confidence
he
sat
more
easily
on
his
chair
you
will
have
your
little
joke
hine
you
could
dispose
of
it
very
good
indeed
i
must
really
tell
that
to
my
dear
wife
but
business
business
he
checked
his
laughter
with
a
determined
effort
and
lowered
his
voice
to
a
confidential
pitch
i
propose
to
allow
you
two
thousand
pounds
a
year
paid
quarterly
in
advance
five
hundred
pounds
each
quarter
forty
pounds
a
week
hine
which
with
your
three
will
make
a
nice
comfortable
living
wage
ha
ha
two
thousand
a
year
gasped
hine
leaning
back
in
his
chair
it
ai
possible
two
thou
here
what
am
i
to
do
for
it
nothing
except
to
spend
it
like
a
gentleman
said
jarvice
beaming
upon
his
visitor
it
did
not
seem
to
occur
to
either
man
that
jarvice
had
set
to
his
loan
the
one
condition
which
walter
hine
never
could
fulfil
walter
hine
was
troubled
with
doubts
of
quite
another
kind
but
you
come
in
somewhere
he
said
bluntly
i
hanged
if
i
see
where
of
course
i
come
in
my
young
friend
replied
jarvice
frankly
i
or
my
executors
for
we
may
have
to
wait
a
long
time
i
propose
that
you
execute
in
my
favor
a
on
your
uncle
life
giving
me
well
we
may
have
to
wait
a
long
time
twenty
years
you
suggested
your
uncle
is
but
a
hale
man
living
in
a
healthy
climate
we
will
say
four
thousand
pounds
for
every
two
thousand
which
i
lend
you
those
are
easy
terms
hine
i
do
make
you
take
cigars
and
sherry
no
i
think
such
practices
almost
reflect
discredit
on
my
calling
two
thousand
a
year
five
hundred
a
quarter
forty
pounds
a
week
with
your
little
income
well
what
do
you
say
hine
sat
dazzled
with
the
prospect
of
wealth
immediate
wealth
actually
within
his
reach
now
but
he
had
lived
amongst
people
who
never
did
anything
for
nothing
who
spoke
only
a
friendship
when
they
proposed
to
borrow
money
and
at
the
back
of
his
mind
suspicion
and
incredulity
were
still
at
work
somehow
jarvice
would
be
getting
the
better
of
him
in
his
dull
way
he
began
to
reason
matters
out
but
suppose
i
died
before
my
uncle
then
you
would
get
nothing
he
objected
ah
to
be
sure
i
had
not
forgotten
that
point
said
jarvice
it
is
a
contingency
of
course
not
very
probable
but
still
we
do
right
to
consider
it
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
once
again
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
his
visitor
in
a
long
and
silent
scrutiny
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
in
a
quieter
voice
than
he
had
used
one
might
almost
have
said
that
the
real
business
of
the
interview
was
only
just
beginning
there
is
a
way
which
will
save
me
from
loss
you
can
insure
your
life
as
against
your
uncle
for
a
round
sum
say
for
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
you
will
make
over
the
policy
to
me
i
shall
pay
the
premiums
and
so
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
you
i
should
be
recouped
he
never
once
removed
his
eyes
from
hine
face
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
his
hands
folded
beneath
his
chin
quite
still
but
with
a
queer
look
of
alertness
upon
his
whole
person
yes
i
see
said
hine
as
he
turned
the
proposal
over
in
his
mind
do
you
agree
asked
jarvice
yes
said
walter
hine
very
well
said
jarvice
all
his
old
briskness
returning
the
sooner
the
arrangement
is
pushed
through
the
better
for
you
eh
you
will
begin
to
touch
the
dibs
he
laughed
and
walter
hine
chuckled
as
to
the
insurance
you
will
have
to
get
the
company
doctor
certificate
and
i
should
think
it
would
be
wise
to
go
steady
for
a
day
or
two
what
you
have
been
going
the
pace
a
bit
have
you
you
had
better
see
your
solicitor
as
soon
as
the
and
the
insurance
policy
are
in
this
office
hine
your
first
quarter
income
is
paid
into
your
bank
i
will
have
an
agreement
drawn
binding
me
on
my
side
to
pay
you
two
thousand
a
year
until
your
uncle
death
jarvice
rose
as
if
the
interview
was
ended
he
moved
some
papers
on
his
table
and
added
carelessly
you
have
a
good
solicitor
i
suppose
i
have
a
solicitor
at
all
said
walter
hine
as
he
too
rose
oh
have
you
said
jarvice
with
all
the
appearance
of
surprise
well
shall
i
give
you
an
introduction
to
one
he
sat
down
wrote
a
note
placed
it
in
an
envelope
which
he
left
unfastened
and
addressed
it
then
he
handed
the
envelope
to
his
client
jones
and
stiles
lincoln
inn
fields
he
said
but
ask
for
driver
tell
him
the
whole
proposal
frankly
and
ask
his
advice
driver
said
hine
fingering
the
envelope
had
i
ought
to
see
one
of
the
partners
jarvice
smiled
you
have
a
business
head
hine
that
very
clear
i
let
you
into
a
secret
driver
is
rather
like
yourself
something
of
a
rebel
hine
he
came
into
disagreement
with
that
very
arbitrary
body
the
incorporated
law
society
so
well
his
name
does
not
figure
in
the
firm
but
he
jones
and
stiles
tell
him
everything
if
he
advises
you
against
my
proposal
i
shall
even
say
take
his
advice
jarvice
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
well
this
is
the
spider
web
you
know
he
said
with
the
laugh
of
one
who
could
afford
to
despise
the
slanders
of
the
not
such
a
very
uncomfortable
place
eh
and
he
bowed
mr
fly
out
of
his
office
he
stood
at
the
door
and
waited
until
the
outer
office
closed
then
he
went
to
his
telephone
and
rang
up
a
particular
number
are
you
jones
and
stiles
he
asked
thank
you
will
you
ask
driver
to
come
to
the
telephone
and
with
driver
he
talked
genially
for
the
space
of
five
minutes
then
and
not
till
then
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
jarvice
turned
to
the
unopened
letters
which
had
come
to
him
by
the
morning
post
chapter
v
michel
revailloud
expounds
his
philosophy
that
summer
was
long
remembered
in
chamonix
july
passed
with
a
procession
of
cloudless
days
valley
and
peak
basked
in
sunlight
august
came
and
on
a
hot
starlit
night
in
the
first
week
of
that
month
chayne
sat
opposite
to
michel
revailloud
in
the
balcony
of
a
café
which
overhangs
the
arve
below
him
the
river
tumbling
swiftly
amidst
the
boulders
flashed
in
the
darkness
like
white
fire
he
sat
facing
the
street
chamonix
was
crowded
and
gay
with
lights
in
the
little
square
just
out
of
sight
upon
the
right
some
traveling
musicians
were
singing
and
up
and
down
the
street
the
visitors
thronged
noisily
women
in
evening
frocks
with
lace
shawls
thrown
about
their
shoulders
and
their
hair
men
in
attendance
upon
them
clerks
from
paris
and
geneva
upon
their
holidays
and
every
now
and
then
a
climber
with
his
guide
come
late
from
the
mountains
would
cross
the
bridge
quickly
and
stride
toward
his
hotel
chayne
watched
the
procession
in
silence
quite
aloof
from
its
and
gaiety
michel
revailloud
drained
his
glass
of
beer
and
as
he
replaced
it
on
the
table
said
wistfully
so
this
is
the
last
night
monsieur
it
is
always
sad
the
last
night
it
is
not
exactly
as
we
planned
it
replied
chayne
and
his
eyes
moved
from
the
throng
before
him
in
the
direction
of
the
churchyard
where
a
few
days
before
his
friend
had
been
laid
amongst
the
other
englishmen
who
had
fallen
in
the
alps
i
do
not
think
that
i
shall
ever
come
back
to
chamonix
he
said
in
a
quiet
and
voice
michel
gravely
nodded
his
head
there
are
no
friendships
said
he
like
those
made
amongst
the
snows
but
this
monsieur
i
say
your
friend
is
not
greatly
to
be
pitied
he
was
young
had
known
no
suffering
no
and
he
died
at
once
he
did
not
even
kick
the
snow
for
a
little
while
no
doubt
that
true
said
chayne
submitting
to
the
commonplace
rather
than
drawing
from
it
any
comfort
he
called
to
the
waiter
since
it
is
the
last
night
michel
he
said
with
a
smile
we
will
drink
another
bottle
of
beer
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
once
more
grew
silent
watching
the
thronged
street
and
the
twinkling
lights
in
the
little
square
one
of
the
musicians
with
a
very
clear
sweet
voice
was
singing
a
plaintive
song
and
above
the
hum
of
the
crowd
the
melody
haunting
in
its
wistfulness
floated
to
chayne
ears
and
troubled
him
with
many
memories
michel
leaned
forward
upon
the
table
and
answered
not
merely
with
sympathy
but
with
the
air
of
one
speaking
out
of
full
knowledge
and
speaking
moreover
in
a
voice
of
warning
true
monsieur
the
happiest
memories
can
be
very
bitter
if
one
has
no
one
to
share
them
all
is
in
that
monsieur
if
and
he
repeated
his
phrase
if
one
has
no
one
to
share
them
then
the
technical
side
of
chayne
proposal
took
hold
of
him
the
col
dolent
you
will
have
to
start
early
from
the
chalet
de
lognan
monsieur
you
will
sleep
there
of
course
you
will
have
to
start
at
midnight
perhaps
even
before
there
is
very
little
snow
this
year
the
great
bergschrund
will
be
very
difficult
in
any
season
it
is
always
difficult
to
cross
that
bergschrund
on
to
the
steep
beyond
it
is
so
badly
bridged
with
snow
this
season
it
will
be
as
bad
as
can
be
the
up
to
the
col
will
also
take
a
long
time
so
start
very
early
as
michel
spoke
as
he
anticipated
the
difficulties
and
set
his
thoughts
to
overcome
them
his
eyes
lit
up
his
whole
face
grew
younger
chayne
smiled
i
wish
you
were
coming
with
me
michel
he
said
and
at
once
the
animation
died
out
of
michel
face
he
became
once
more
a
sad
dispirited
man
alas
monsieur
he
said
i
have
crossed
my
last
col
i
have
ascended
my
last
mountain
you
michel
cried
chayne
yes
monsieur
i
replied
michel
quietly
i
have
grown
old
my
eyes
hurt
me
on
the
mountains
and
my
feet
burn
i
am
no
longer
fit
for
anything
except
to
lead
mules
up
to
the
montanvert
and
conduct
parties
on
the
mer
de
glace
chayne
stared
at
michel
revailloud
he
thought
of
what
the
guide
life
had
been
of
its
interest
its
energy
its
achievement
more
than
one
of
those
aiguilles
towering
upon
his
left
hand
into
the
sky
had
been
first
conquered
by
michel
revailloud
and
how
he
had
enjoyed
it
all
what
resource
he
had
shown
what
cheerfulness
remorse
gradually
seized
upon
chayne
as
he
looked
across
the
little
iron
table
at
his
guide
yes
it
is
a
little
sad
continued
revailloud
but
i
think
that
toward
the
end
life
is
always
a
little
sad
if
and
the
note
of
warning
once
more
was
audible
if
one
has
no
companion
to
share
memories
the
very
resignation
of
michel
voice
brought
chayne
to
a
yet
deeper
compunction
the
wistful
melody
still
throbbed
high
and
sank
and
soared
again
above
the
murmurs
of
the
and
floated
away
upon
the
clear
hot
starlit
night
chayne
wondered
with
what
words
it
spoke
to
his
old
guide
he
looked
at
the
tired
sad
face
on
which
a
smile
of
friendliness
now
played
and
his
heart
ached
he
felt
some
shame
that
his
own
troubles
had
so
engrossed
him
after
all
lattery
was
not
greatly
to
be
pitied
that
was
true
he
himself
too
was
young
there
would
come
other
summers
other
friends
the
real
irreparable
trouble
sat
there
before
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
iron
table
the
trouble
of
an
old
age
to
be
lived
out
in
loneliness
you
never
married
michel
he
said
no
there
was
a
time
long
ago
when
i
would
have
liked
to
the
guide
answered
simply
but
i
think
now
it
was
as
well
that
i
did
not
get
my
way
she
was
very
extravagant
she
would
have
needed
much
money
and
guides
are
poor
people
monsieur
not
like
your
professional
cricketers
he
said
with
a
laugh
and
then
he
turned
toward
the
massive
wall
of
mountains
here
and
there
a
slim
rock
spire
the
dru
or
the
charmoz
pointed
a
finger
to
the
stars
here
and
there
an
glimmered
like
a
white
mist
held
in
a
fold
of
the
hills
but
to
michel
revailloud
the
whole
vast
range
was
spread
out
as
on
a
raised
map
buttress
and
peak
and
dome
of
snow
from
the
aiguille
in
the
east
to
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
in
the
west
in
his
thoughts
he
turned
from
mountain
to
mountain
and
found
each
one
majestic
and
beautiful
dear
as
a
living
friend
and
hallowed
with
recollections
he
remembered
days
when
they
had
called
and
not
in
vain
for
courage
and
endurance
days
of
blinding
and
bitter
winds
which
had
caught
him
up
some
precipice
of
rock
or
on
some
long
steep
crusted
dangerously
with
thin
snow
into
which
the
ax
must
cut
deep
hour
after
hour
however
frozen
the
fingers
or
tired
the
limbs
he
recalled
the
thrill
of
joy
with
which
after
many
vain
attempts
he
the
first
of
men
had
stepped
on
to
the
small
topmost
pinnacle
of
this
or
that
new
peak
he
recalled
the
days
of
travel
the
long
glacier
walks
on
the
high
level
from
chamonix
to
zermatt
and
from
zermatt
again
to
the
oberland
the
still
clear
mornings
and
the
pink
flush
upon
some
high
white
cone
which
told
that
somewhere
the
sun
had
risen
and
the
unknown
ridges
where
expected
difficulties
suddenly
vanished
at
the
climber
approach
and
others
where
an
easy
scramble
suddenly
turned
into
the
most
difficult
of
climbs
michel
raised
his
glass
in
the
air
here
is
to
you
the
long
he
said
and
his
voice
broke
and
abruptly
he
turned
to
chayne
with
his
eyes
full
of
tears
and
began
to
speak
in
a
quick
passionate
whisper
while
the
veins
stood
out
upon
his
forehead
and
his
face
quivered
monsieur
i
told
you
your
friend
was
not
greatly
to
be
pitied
i
tell
you
now
something
more
the
guide
we
brought
down
with
him
from
the
glacier
des
nantillons
a
fortnight
back
all
this
fortnight
i
have
been
envying
him
yes
yes
even
though
he
kicked
the
snow
with
his
feet
for
a
little
before
he
died
it
is
better
to
do
so
than
to
lead
mules
up
to
the
montanvert
i
am
sorry
said
chayne
the
words
sounded
as
he
spoke
them
lame
enough
and
trivial
in
the
face
of
michel
passionate
lament
but
they
had
an
astonishing
effect
upon
the
guide
the
flow
of
words
stopped
at
once
he
looked
at
his
young
patron
almost
whimsically
and
a
little
smile
played
about
his
mouth
am
sorry
he
repeated
those
were
the
words
the
young
lady
spoke
to
you
on
the
steps
of
the
hotel
you
have
spoken
with
her
monsieur
and
thanked
her
for
them
no
said
chayne
and
there
was
much
indifference
in
his
voice
women
had
as
yet
not
played
a
great
part
in
chayne
life
easy
to
please
but
difficult
to
stir
he
had
in
the
main
just
talked
with
them
by
the
way
and
gone
on
forgetfully
and
when
any
one
had
turned
and
walked
a
little
of
his
road
beside
him
she
had
brought
to
him
no
thought
that
here
might
be
a
companion
for
all
the
way
his
indifference
roused
michel
to
repeat
and
this
time
unmistakably
the
warning
he
had
twice
uttered
he
leaned
across
the
table
fixing
his
eyes
very
earnestly
on
his
patron
face
take
care
monsieur
he
said
you
are
lonely
very
lonely
then
take
good
care
that
your
old
age
is
not
one
lonely
night
like
this
repeated
and
repeated
through
many
years
take
good
care
that
when
you
in
your
turn
come
to
the
end
and
say
too
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
mountains
you
have
some
one
to
share
your
memories
see
monsieur
and
very
wistfully
he
began
to
plead
i
go
home
i
go
out
of
chamonix
i
cross
a
field
or
two
i
come
to
les
and
my
cottage
i
push
open
the
door
it
is
all
dark
within
i
light
my
own
lamp
and
i
sit
there
a
little
by
myself
take
an
old
man
wisdom
monsieur
when
it
is
all
over
and
you
go
home
take
care
that
there
is
a
lighted
lamp
in
the
room
and
the
room
not
empty
have
some
one
to
share
your
memories
when
life
is
nothing
but
memories
he
rose
as
he
ended
and
held
out
his
hand
as
chayne
took
it
the
guide
spoke
again
and
his
voice
shook
monsieur
you
have
been
a
good
patron
to
me
he
said
with
a
quiet
and
most
dignified
simplicity
and
i
make
you
what
return
i
can
i
have
spoken
to
you
out
of
my
heart
for
you
will
not
return
to
chamonix
and
after
we
shall
not
meet
again
thank
you
said
chayne
and
he
added
we
have
had
many
good
days
together
michel
we
have
monsieur
i
climbed
my
first
mountain
with
you
the
aiguille
du
midi
i
remember
it
well
both
were
silent
after
that
and
for
the
same
reason
neither
could
trust
his
voice
michel
revailloud
picked
up
his
hat
turned
abruptly
away
and
walked
out
of
the
café
into
the
throng
of
people
chayne
resumed
his
seat
and
sat
there
silent
and
thoughtful
until
the
street
began
to
empty
and
the
musicians
in
the
square
ceased
from
their
songs
meanwhile
michel
revailloud
walked
slowly
down
the
street
stopping
to
speak
with
any
one
he
knew
however
slightly
that
he
might
defer
his
entrance
into
the
dark
and
empty
cottage
at
les
he
drew
near
to
the
hotel
where
chayne
was
staying
and
saw
under
the
lamp
above
the
door
a
guide
whom
he
knew
talking
with
a
young
girl
the
young
girl
raised
her
head
it
was
she
who
had
said
i
am
sorry
as
michel
came
within
the
circle
of
light
she
recognized
him
she
spoke
quickly
to
the
guide
and
he
turned
at
once
and
called
michel
and
when
revailloud
approached
he
presented
him
to
sylvia
thesiger
he
has
made
many
first
ascents
in
the
range
of
mont
blanc
mademoiselle
sylvia
held
out
her
hand
with
a
smile
of
admiration
i
know
she
said
i
have
read
of
them
really
cried
michel
you
have
read
of
them
you
mademoiselle
there
was
as
much
pleasure
as
wonder
in
his
tone
after
all
flattery
from
the
lips
of
a
woman
young
and
beautiful
was
not
to
be
despised
he
thought
the
more
especially
when
the
flattery
was
so
very
well
deserved
life
had
perhaps
one
or
two
compensations
to
offer
him
in
his
old
age
yes
indeed
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
michel
i
have
known
your
name
a
long
while
and
envied
you
for
living
in
the
days
when
these
mountains
were
unknown
revailloud
forgot
the
mules
to
the
montanvert
and
the
tourists
on
the
mer
de
glace
he
warmed
into
cheerfulness
this
young
girl
looked
at
him
with
so
frank
an
envy
yes
those
were
great
days
mademoiselle
he
said
with
a
thrill
of
pride
in
his
voice
but
if
we
love
the
mountains
the
first
ascent
or
the
hundredth
there
is
just
the
same
joy
when
you
feel
the
rough
rock
beneath
your
fingers
or
the
snow
crisp
under
your
feet
perhaps
mademoiselle
herself
will
some
time
at
once
sylvia
interrupted
him
with
an
eager
happiness
yes
she
said
oho
it
is
your
first
mountain
mademoiselle
yes
and
jean
here
is
your
guide
jean
and
his
brother
i
suppose
michel
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
the
guide
shoulder
you
could
not
do
better
mademoiselle
he
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
for
a
little
while
she
was
fresh
fresh
as
the
smell
of
the
earth
in
spring
after
a
fall
of
rain
her
eyes
the
alertness
of
her
face
the
eager
tones
of
her
voice
were
irresistible
to
him
an
old
tired
man
how
much
more
irresistible
then
to
a
younger
man
her
buoyancy
would
lift
such
an
one
clear
above
his
melancholy
though
it
were
deep
as
the
sea
he
himself
michel
revailloud
felt
twice
the
fellow
he
had
been
when
he
sat
in
the
balcony
above
the
arve
and
what
mountain
is
it
to
be
mademoiselle
he
asked
the
girl
took
a
step
from
the
door
of
the
hotel
and
looked
upward
to
the
south
but
quite
close
the
long
thin
ridge
of
the
aiguille
des
charmoz
towered
jagged
and
black
against
the
starlit
sky
on
one
pinnacle
of
that
ridge
a
slab
of
stone
was
poised
like
the
top
of
a
round
table
on
the
slant
it
was
at
that
particular
pinnacle
that
sylvia
looked
des
charmoz
said
michel
doubtfully
and
sylvia
swung
round
to
him
and
argued
against
his
doubt
but
i
have
trained
myself
she
said
i
have
been
up
the
brévent
and
flégère
i
am
strong
stronger
than
i
look
michel
revailloud
smiled
mademoiselle
i
do
not
doubt
you
a
young
lady
who
has
enthusiasm
is
very
hard
to
tire
it
is
not
because
of
the
difficulty
of
that
that
i
thought
to
suggest
the
aiguille
sylvia
turned
with
some
hesitation
to
the
younger
guide
you
too
spoke
of
that
mountain
she
said
michel
pressed
his
advantage
and
wisely
mademoiselle
if
you
will
let
me
advise
you
you
will
sleep
night
at
the
pavillon
de
lognan
and
the
next
day
climb
the
aiguille
sylvia
looked
regretfully
up
to
the
ridge
of
the
charmoz
which
during
this
last
fortnight
had
greatly
attracted
her
she
turned
her
eyes
from
the
mountain
to
revailloud
and
let
them
rest
quietly
upon
his
face
and
why
do
you
advise
the
aiguille
she
asked
michel
saw
her
eyes
softly
shining
upon
him
in
the
darkness
and
all
the
more
persisted
was
not
his
dear
patron
who
must
needs
be
helped
to
open
his
eyes
since
he
would
not
open
them
himself
going
to
sleep
in
the
pavillon
de
lognan
the
roads
to
the
col
dolent
and
the
aiguille
both
start
from
that
small
mountain
inn
but
this
was
hardly
the
reason
which
michel
could
give
to
the
young
girl
who
questioned
him
he
bethought
him
of
another
argument
a
subtle
one
which
he
fancied
would
strongly
appeal
to
her
moreover
there
was
truth
in
it
i
will
tell
you
why
mademoiselle
it
is
to
be
your
first
mountain
it
will
be
a
day
in
your
life
which
you
will
never
forget
therefore
you
want
it
to
be
as
complete
as
possible
is
it
not
so
it
is
a
good
the
aiguille
des
charmoz
yes
but
the
argentière
is
more
complete
there
is
a
glacier
a
rock
traverse
a
couloir
up
a
and
at
the
top
of
that
a
steep
and
that
is
not
all
you
want
your
last
step
on
to
the
summit
to
reveal
a
new
world
to
you
on
the
charmoz
it
is
true
there
is
a
cleft
at
the
very
top
up
which
you
scramble
between
two
straight
walls
and
you
pop
your
head
out
above
the
mountain
yes
but
you
see
little
that
is
new
for
before
you
enter
the
cleft
you
see
both
sides
of
the
mountain
with
the
argentière
it
is
different
you
mount
at
the
last
for
quite
a
time
behind
the
mountain
with
your
face
to
the
and
then
suddenly
you
step
out
upon
the
top
and
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
will
strike
suddenly
upon
your
eyes
and
heart
see
mademoiselle
i
love
these
mountains
with
a
very
great
pride
and
i
would
dearly
like
you
to
have
that
wonderful
white
revelation
of
a
new
strange
world
upon
your
first
ascent
before
he
had
ended
he
knew
that
he
had
won
he
heard
the
girl
draw
sharply
in
her
breath
she
was
making
for
herself
a
picture
of
the
last
step
from
the
to
summit
ridge
very
well
she
said
it
shall
be
the
aiguille
michel
went
upon
his
way
out
of
chamonix
and
across
the
fields
they
would
be
sure
to
speak
those
two
at
the
pavillon
de
lognan
if
only
there
were
no
other
party
there
in
that
small
inn
michel
hopes
took
a
leap
and
reached
beyond
the
pavillon
de
lognan
to
ascend
first
mountain
yes
that
was
enviable
and
good
but
one
should
have
a
companion
with
whom
one
can
live
over
again
the
raptures
of
that
day
in
the
after
time
well
perhaps
perhaps
michel
pushed
open
the
door
of
his
cottage
and
lit
his
lamp
without
after
all
bethinking
him
that
the
room
was
dark
and
empty
his
stood
in
a
corner
the
polished
steel
of
their
gleaming
in
the
light
his
and
some
coils
of
rope
hung
upon
pegs
his
book
with
the
signatures
and
the
comments
of
his
patrons
lay
at
his
elbow
on
the
table
a
complete
record
of
his
life
but
he
was
not
thinking
that
they
had
served
him
for
the
last
time
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
and
so
remained
for
a
little
while
but
a
smile
was
upon
his
face
and
once
or
twice
he
chuckled
aloud
as
he
thought
of
his
high
diplomacy
he
did
not
remember
at
all
that
he
would
lead
mules
up
to
the
montanvert
and
conduct
parties
on
the
mer
de
glace
chapter
vi
the
pavillon
de
lognan
the
pavillon
de
lognan
is
built
high
upon
the
southern
slope
of
the
valley
of
chamonix
under
the
great
buttresses
of
the
aiguille
verte
it
faces
the
north
and
from
the
railed
parapet
before
its
door
the
path
winds
down
through
pastures
bright
with
alpine
flowers
to
the
pine
woods
and
the
village
of
les
tines
in
the
bed
of
the
valley
but
at
its
eastern
end
a
precipice
drops
to
the
great
of
the
glacier
and
night
and
day
from
far
below
the
roar
of
the
glacier
streams
enters
in
at
the
windows
and
fills
the
rooms
with
the
music
of
a
river
in
spate
at
five
on
the
next
afternoon
chayne
was
leaning
upon
the
rail
looking
straight
down
to
the
the
din
of
the
torrent
was
in
his
ears
and
it
was
not
until
a
foot
sounded
lightly
close
behind
him
that
he
knew
he
was
no
longer
alone
he
turned
round
and
saw
to
his
surprise
the
doll
of
the
annemasse
buffet
the
child
of
the
casinos
and
the
bathing
beaches
sylvia
thesiger
his
surprise
was
very
noticeable
and
sylvia
face
flushed
she
made
him
a
little
bow
and
went
into
the
chalet
chayne
noticed
a
couple
of
fresh
guides
by
the
door
of
the
quarters
he
remembered
the
book
which
he
had
seen
her
reading
with
so
deep
an
interest
in
the
buffet
and
in
a
minute
or
two
she
came
out
again
on
to
the
earth
platform
and
he
saw
that
she
was
not
overdressed
she
was
simply
and
warmly
dressed
in
a
way
which
suggested
business
on
the
other
hand
she
had
not
made
herself
ungainly
he
guessed
her
mountain
and
named
it
to
her
yes
she
replied
please
say
that
it
will
be
fine
i
have
never
seen
an
evening
of
better
promise
returned
chayne
with
a
smile
at
her
eagerness
the
brown
cliffs
of
the
aiguille
du
chardonnet
just
across
the
glacier
glowed
red
in
the
sunlight
and
only
a
wisp
of
white
cloud
trailed
like
a
lady
scarf
here
and
there
in
the
blue
of
the
sky
the
woman
of
the
chalet
came
out
and
spoke
to
him
she
wants
to
know
when
we
will
dine
he
explained
to
sylvia
there
are
only
you
and
i
we
should
dine
early
for
you
will
have
to
start
early
and
he
repeated
the
invariable
cry
of
that
year
there
is
so
very
little
snow
it
may
take
you
some
time
to
get
off
the
glacier
on
to
your
mountain
there
is
always
a
crevasse
to
cross
i
know
said
sylvia
with
a
smile
the
bergschrund
i
beg
your
pardon
said
chayne
and
in
his
turn
he
smiled
too
of
course
you
know
these
terms
i
saw
you
reading
a
copy
of
the
journal
they
dined
together
an
hour
later
with
the
light
of
the
sunset
reddening
the
whitewashed
walls
of
the
little
simple
room
and
bathing
in
glory
the
hills
without
sylvia
thesiger
could
hardly
eat
for
wonder
her
face
was
always
to
the
window
her
lips
were
always
parted
in
a
smile
her
gray
eyes
bright
with
happiness
i
have
never
known
anything
like
this
she
said
it
is
all
so
strange
so
very
beautiful
her
freshness
and
simplicity
laid
their
charm
on
him
even
as
they
had
done
on
michel
revailloud
the
night
before
she
was
as
eager
as
a
child
to
get
the
meal
done
with
and
to
go
out
again
into
the
open
air
before
the
had
faded
from
the
peaks
there
was
something
almost
pathetic
in
her
desire
to
make
the
very
most
of
such
rare
moments
her
eagerness
so
clearly
told
him
that
such
holidays
came
but
seldom
in
her
life
he
urged
her
however
to
eat
and
when
she
had
done
they
went
out
together
and
sat
upon
the
bench
watching
in
silence
the
light
upon
the
peaks
change
from
purple
to
rose
the
rocks
grow
cold
and
the
blue
of
the
sky
deepen
as
the
night
came
you
too
are
making
an
ascent
she
asked
no
he
answered
i
am
crossing
a
pass
into
italy
i
am
going
away
from
chamonix
altogether
sylvia
turned
to
him
her
eyes
were
gentle
with
sympathy
yes
i
understand
that
she
said
i
am
sorry
you
said
that
once
before
to
me
on
the
steps
of
the
hotel
said
chayne
it
was
kind
of
you
though
i
said
nothing
i
was
grateful
and
he
was
moved
to
open
his
heart
to
her
and
to
speak
of
his
dead
friend
the
darkness
gathered
about
them
he
spoke
in
the
curt
sentences
which
men
use
who
shrink
from
any
emotional
display
he
interrupted
himself
to
light
his
pipe
but
none
the
less
she
understood
the
reality
of
his
distress
he
told
her
with
a
freedom
of
which
he
was
not
himself
at
the
moment
quite
aware
of
a
clean
strong
friendship
which
owed
nothing
to
sentiment
which
was
never
fed
by
protestations
which
endured
through
long
intervals
and
was
established
by
the
memory
of
great
dangers
cheerily
encountered
and
overcome
it
had
begun
amongst
the
mountains
and
surely
she
thought
it
had
retained
to
the
end
something
of
their
inspiration
we
first
met
in
the
tyrol
eight
years
ago
i
had
crossed
a
mountain
with
a
guide
the
glockturm
and
came
down
in
the
evening
to
the
radurschal
thal
where
i
had
heard
there
was
an
inn
the
evening
had
turned
to
rain
but
from
a
shoulder
of
the
mountain
i
had
been
able
to
look
right
down
the
valley
and
had
seen
one
long
low
building
about
four
miles
from
the
foot
of
the
glacier
i
walked
through
the
pastures
toward
it
and
found
sitting
outside
the
door
in
the
rain
the
man
who
was
to
be
my
friend
the
door
was
locked
and
there
was
no
one
about
the
house
nor
was
there
any
other
house
within
miles
my
guide
however
went
on
lattery
and
i
sat
out
there
in
the
rain
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
then
an
old
woman
with
a
big
umbrella
held
above
her
head
came
down
from
the
upper
pastures
driving
some
cows
in
front
of
her
she
told
us
that
no
one
had
stayed
at
her
inn
for
fourteen
years
but
she
opened
her
door
lit
us
a
great
fire
and
cooked
us
eggs
and
made
us
coffee
i
remember
that
night
as
clearly
as
if
it
were
yesterday
we
sat
in
front
of
the
fire
with
the
bedding
and
the
mattresses
airing
behind
us
until
late
into
the
night
the
rain
got
worse
too
there
was
a
hole
in
the
thatch
overhead
and
through
it
i
saw
the
lightning
slash
the
sky
as
i
lay
in
bed
very
few
people
ever
came
up
or
down
that
valley
and
the
next
morning
after
the
storm
the
chamois
were
close
about
the
inn
on
the
grass
we
went
on
together
that
was
the
beginning
he
spoke
simply
with
a
deep
quietude
of
voice
the
tobacco
glowed
and
grew
dull
in
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
regularly
the
darkness
hid
his
face
but
the
tenderness
almost
the
amusement
with
which
he
dwelt
on
the
little
insignificant
details
of
that
first
meeting
showed
her
how
very
near
to
him
it
was
at
this
moment
we
went
from
the
tyrol
down
to
verona
and
baked
ourselves
in
the
sun
there
for
a
day
under
the
colonnades
and
then
came
back
through
the
gotthard
to
göschenen
do
you
know
the
göschenen
thal
there
is
a
semicircle
of
mountains
the
winterbergen
which
closes
it
in
at
the
head
we
climbed
there
together
for
a
week
just
he
and
i
and
no
guides
i
remember
a
there
it
was
barred
by
a
pinnacle
which
stood
up
from
it
gendarme
as
they
call
it
we
had
to
leave
the
arête
and
work
out
along
the
face
of
the
pinnacle
at
right
angles
to
the
mountain
there
was
a
little
ledge
you
could
look
down
between
your
feet
quite
straight
to
the
glacier
two
thousand
feet
below
we
came
to
a
place
where
the
wall
of
the
pinnacle
seemed
possible
almost
ten
feet
above
us
there
was
a
flaw
in
the
rock
which
elsewhere
was
quite
perpendicular
i
was
the
lightest
so
my
friend
planted
himself
as
firmly
as
he
could
on
the
ledge
with
his
hands
flat
against
the
rock
face
there
was
any
handhold
you
see
and
i
climbed
out
on
to
his
back
and
stood
upon
his
shoulders
i
saw
that
the
rock
sloped
back
from
the
flaw
or
cleft
in
quite
a
practicable
way
only
there
was
a
big
boulder
resting
on
the
slope
within
reach
and
which
we
could
hardly
avoid
touching
it
did
not
look
very
secure
so
i
put
out
my
hand
and
just
touched
it
quite
quite
gently
but
it
was
so
exactly
balanced
that
the
least
little
vibration
overset
it
and
i
saw
it
begin
to
move
very
slowly
as
if
it
meant
no
harm
whatever
but
it
was
moving
nevertheless
toward
me
my
chest
was
on
a
level
with
the
top
of
the
cleft
so
that
i
had
a
good
view
of
the
boulder
i
could
do
anything
at
all
it
was
much
too
heavy
and
big
for
my
arms
to
stop
and
i
move
of
course
since
i
was
standing
on
jack
lattery
shoulders
there
did
not
seem
very
much
chance
with
nothing
below
us
except
two
thousand
feet
of
vacancy
but
there
was
just
at
my
side
a
little
bit
of
a
crack
in
the
edge
of
the
cleft
and
there
was
just
a
chance
that
the
rock
might
shoot
out
down
that
cleft
past
me
i
remember
standing
and
watching
the
thing
sliding
down
not
in
a
rush
at
all
but
very
smoothly
almost
in
a
friendly
sort
of
way
and
i
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
it
reached
me
luckily
some
irregularity
in
the
slope
of
rock
just
twisted
it
into
the
crack
and
it
suddenly
shot
out
into
the
air
at
my
side
with
a
whizz
it
was
so
close
to
me
that
it
cut
the
cloth
of
my
sleeve
i
had
been
so
fascinated
by
the
gentle
movement
of
the
boulder
that
i
had
forgotten
altogether
to
tell
lattery
what
was
happening
and
when
it
whizzed
out
over
his
head
he
was
so
startled
that
he
nearly
lost
his
balance
on
the
little
shelf
and
we
were
within
an
ace
of
following
our
rock
down
to
the
glacier
those
were
our
early
days
and
he
laughed
with
a
low
deep
ring
of
amusement
in
his
voice
we
were
late
that
day
on
the
mountain
he
resumed
and
it
was
dark
when
we
got
down
to
a
long
at
its
foot
it
was
new
ground
to
us
we
were
very
tired
we
saw
it
glimmering
away
below
us
it
might
end
in
a
crevasse
and
a
glacier
for
all
we
knew
and
we
debated
whether
we
should
be
prudent
or
chance
it
we
chanced
the
crevasse
we
sat
down
and
glissaded
in
the
dark
with
only
the
vaguest
idea
where
we
should
end
altogether
we
had
very
good
times
he
and
i
well
they
have
come
to
an
end
on
the
glacier
des
nantillons
chayne
became
silent
sylvia
thesiger
sat
at
his
side
and
did
not
interrupt
in
front
of
them
the
pastures
slid
away
into
darkness
only
a
few
small
clear
lights
shining
in
the
chalets
told
them
there
were
other
people
awake
in
the
world
except
for
the
reverberation
of
the
torrent
deep
in
the
gorge
at
their
right
no
sound
at
all
broke
the
deep
silence
chayne
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
have
been
talking
to
you
about
one
whom
you
never
knew
you
were
so
quiet
that
i
seemed
to
be
merely
remembering
to
myself
i
was
so
quiet
sylvia
explained
because
i
wished
you
to
go
on
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
you
it
was
all
new
and
strange
and
very
pleasant
to
me
this
story
of
your
friendship
as
strange
and
pleasant
as
this
cool
quiet
night
here
a
long
way
from
the
hotels
and
the
noise
on
the
edge
of
the
snow
for
i
have
heard
little
of
such
friendships
and
i
have
seen
still
less
chayne
thoughts
were
suddenly
turned
from
his
dead
friend
to
this
the
living
companion
at
his
side
there
was
something
rather
sad
and
pitiful
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
no
less
than
in
the
words
she
used
she
spoke
with
so
much
humility
he
was
aware
with
a
kind
of
shock
that
here
was
a
woman
not
a
child
he
turned
his
eyes
to
her
as
he
had
turned
his
thoughts
he
could
see
dimly
the
profile
of
her
face
it
was
still
as
the
night
itself
she
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
into
the
darkness
he
pondered
upon
her
life
and
how
she
bore
with
it
and
how
she
had
kept
herself
unspoiled
by
its
associations
of
the
saving
grace
of
her
dreams
he
knew
nothing
but
the
picture
of
her
mother
was
vivid
to
his
eyes
the
outlawed
mother
shunned
instinctively
by
the
women
noisy
and
shrill
and
making
her
companions
of
the
fashionable
loiterers
and
the
officers
run
to
seed
that
she
bore
it
ill
her
last
words
had
shown
him
they
had
thrown
a
stray
ray
of
light
upon
a
dark
place
which
seemed
a
place
of
not
much
happiness
i
am
very
glad
that
you
are
here
he
said
it
has
been
kind
of
you
to
listen
i
rather
dreaded
this
evening
though
what
he
said
was
true
it
was
half
from
pity
that
he
said
it
he
wished
her
to
feel
her
value
and
in
reply
she
gave
him
yet
another
glimpse
into
the
dark
place
your
friend
she
said
must
have
been
much
loved
in
chamonix
why
so
many
guides
came
of
their
own
accord
to
search
for
him
again
chayne
face
was
turned
quickly
toward
her
here
indeed
was
a
sign
of
the
people
amongst
whom
she
lived
and
of
their
unillumined
thoughts
there
must
be
the
personal
reason
always
the
personal
reason
or
money
outside
of
these
there
were
no
motives
he
answered
her
gently
no
i
think
that
was
not
the
reason
how
shall
i
put
it
to
you
he
leaned
forward
with
his
elbows
upon
his
knees
and
spoke
slowly
choosing
his
words
i
think
these
guides
obeyed
a
law
a
law
not
of
any
making
and
the
one
law
last
broken
the
law
that
what
you
know
that
you
must
do
if
by
doing
it
you
can
save
a
life
i
should
think
nine
medals
out
of
ten
given
by
the
humane
society
are
given
because
of
the
compulsion
of
that
law
if
you
can
swim
sail
a
boat
or
climb
a
mountain
and
the
moment
comes
when
a
life
can
only
be
saved
if
you
use
your
knowledge
well
you
have
got
to
use
it
that
the
law
very
often
i
have
no
doubt
it
quite
reluctantly
obeyed
in
most
cases
i
think
it
obeyed
by
instinct
without
consideration
of
the
consequences
but
it
obeyed
and
the
guides
obeyed
it
when
so
many
of
them
came
with
me
on
to
the
glacier
des
nantillons
he
heard
the
girl
at
his
side
draw
in
a
sharp
breath
she
shivered
you
are
cold
no
she
answered
but
that
too
is
all
strange
to
me
i
should
have
known
of
that
law
without
the
need
to
be
told
of
it
but
i
shall
not
forget
it
again
humility
was
very
audible
in
the
quiet
tone
of
her
voice
she
understood
that
she
had
been
instructed
she
felt
she
should
not
have
needed
it
she
faced
her
ignorance
frankly
what
one
knows
that
one
must
do
she
repeated
fixing
the
words
in
her
mind
if
by
doing
it
one
can
save
a
life
no
i
shall
not
forget
that
she
rose
from
the
seat
i
must
go
in
yes
cried
chayne
starting
up
you
have
stayed
up
too
long
as
it
is
you
will
be
tired
not
till
evening
she
said
with
a
laugh
she
looked
upward
to
the
starlit
sky
it
will
be
fine
i
hope
oh
it
be
fine
is
my
one
day
i
do
so
want
it
to
be
perfect
she
exclaimed
i
do
think
you
need
fear
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
this
is
i
suppose
she
said
and
she
did
not
hide
the
regret
the
words
brought
to
her
chayne
took
her
hand
and
kept
it
for
a
second
or
two
he
ought
to
start
an
hour
and
a
half
before
her
that
he
knew
very
well
but
he
answered
no
we
go
the
same
road
for
a
little
while
when
do
you
start
at
half
past
one
i
too
it
will
be
daybreak
before
we
say
i
wonder
whether
you
will
sleep
at
all
i
never
do
the
first
night
he
spoke
lightly
and
she
answered
him
in
the
same
key
i
shall
hardly
know
whether
i
sleep
or
wake
with
the
noise
of
that
stream
rising
through
my
window
for
so
far
back
as
i
can
remember
i
always
dream
of
running
water
the
words
laid
hold
upon
chayne
imagination
and
fixed
her
in
his
memories
he
knew
nothing
of
her
really
except
just
this
one
curious
fact
she
dreamed
of
running
water
somehow
it
was
fitting
that
she
should
there
was
a
kind
of
resemblance
running
water
was
in
a
way
an
image
of
her
she
seemed
in
her
nature
to
be
as
clear
and
fresh
yet
she
was
as
elusive
and
when
she
laughed
her
laugh
had
a
music
as
light
and
free
she
went
into
the
chalet
through
the
window
chayne
saw
her
strike
a
match
and
hold
it
to
the
candle
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
out
at
him
gravely
with
the
light
shining
upward
upon
her
young
face
then
a
smile
hesitated
upon
her
lips
and
slowly
took
possession
of
her
cheeks
and
eyes
she
turned
and
went
into
her
room
chapter
vii
the
aiguille
chayne
smoked
another
pipe
alone
and
then
walking
to
the
end
of
the
little
terrace
looked
down
on
to
the
glistening
field
of
ice
below
along
that
side
of
the
chalet
no
light
was
burning
was
she
listening
was
she
asleep
the
pity
which
had
been
kindled
within
him
grew
as
he
thought
upon
her
she
would
be
going
back
to
a
life
she
clearly
hated
on
the
whole
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
world
might
have
been
better
organized
he
lit
his
candle
and
went
to
bed
and
it
seemed
that
not
five
minutes
had
passed
before
one
of
his
guides
knocked
upon
his
door
when
he
came
into
the
sylvia
thesiger
was
already
breakfasting
did
you
sleep
he
asked
i
was
too
excited
she
answered
but
i
am
not
tired
and
certainly
there
was
no
trace
of
fatigue
in
her
appearance
they
started
at
half
past
one
and
went
up
behind
the
hut
the
stars
shimmered
overhead
in
a
dark
and
cloudless
sky
the
night
was
still
as
yet
there
was
no
sign
of
dawn
the
great
rock
cliffs
of
the
chardonnet
across
the
glacier
and
the
towering
of
the
aiguille
verte
beneath
which
they
passed
were
all
hidden
in
darkness
they
might
have
been
walking
on
some
desolate
plain
of
stones
flat
from
horizon
to
horizon
they
walked
in
single
file
jean
leading
with
a
lighted
lantern
in
his
hand
so
that
sylvia
who
followed
next
might
pick
her
way
amongst
the
boulders
thus
they
marched
for
two
hours
along
the
left
bank
of
the
glacier
and
then
descended
on
to
ice
they
went
forward
partly
on
moraine
partly
on
ice
at
the
foot
of
the
crags
of
the
aiguille
verte
and
gradually
the
darkness
thinned
dim
masses
of
black
rock
began
to
loom
high
overhead
and
to
all
seeming
very
far
away
the
sky
paled
the
dim
masses
of
rock
drew
near
about
the
climbers
and
over
the
steep
walls
the
light
flowed
into
the
white
basin
of
the
glacier
as
though
from
every
quarter
of
the
sky
sylvia
stopped
and
chayne
came
up
with
her
well
he
asked
and
as
he
saw
her
face
his
thoughts
were
suddenly
swept
back
to
the
morning
when
the
beauty
of
the
was
for
the
first
time
vouchsafed
to
him
he
seemed
to
recapture
the
fine
emotion
of
that
moment
sylvia
stood
gazing
with
parted
lips
up
that
wide
and
level
glacier
to
its
head
the
majestic
silence
of
the
place
astounded
her
there
was
no
whisper
of
wind
no
rustling
of
trees
no
sound
of
any
bird
as
yet
too
there
was
no
crack
of
ice
no
roar
of
falling
stones
and
as
the
silence
surprised
her
ears
so
the
simplicity
of
color
smote
upon
her
eyes
there
were
no
gradations
white
ice
filled
the
basin
and
reached
high
into
the
recesses
of
the
mountains
hanging
in
rugged
glaciers
upon
their
flanks
and
streaking
the
gullies
with
smooth
narrow
ribands
and
about
the
ice
and
above
it
circling
it
in
black
walls
of
rock
towered
high
astonishingly
steep
and
broken
at
the
top
into
pinnacles
of
an
exquisite
beauty
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
seen
this
said
sylvia
as
she
stored
the
picture
in
her
mind
more
glad
than
i
am
even
now
it
will
be
a
good
memory
to
fall
back
upon
when
things
are
troublesome
must
things
be
troublesome
he
asked
do
let
me
spoil
my
one
day
she
said
with
a
smile
she
moved
on
and
chayne
falling
back
spoke
for
a
little
with
his
guides
a
little
further
on
jean
stopped
that
is
our
mountain
mademoiselle
he
said
pointing
eastward
across
the
glacier
sylvia
turned
in
that
direction
straight
in
front
of
her
a
bay
of
ice
ran
back
sloping
ever
upward
and
around
the
bay
there
rose
a
steep
wall
of
cliffs
which
in
the
center
sharpened
precipitously
to
an
apex
the
apex
was
not
a
point
but
a
rounded
level
ridge
of
snow
which
curved
over
on
the
top
of
the
cliffs
like
a
billow
of
foam
a
tiny
black
tower
of
rock
stood
alone
on
the
northern
end
of
the
that
mademoiselle
is
the
aiguille
we
cross
the
glacier
here
jean
put
the
rope
about
her
waist
fixing
it
with
the
fisherman
bend
and
tied
one
end
about
his
own
using
the
overhand
knot
while
his
brother
tied
on
behind
they
then
turned
at
right
angles
to
their
former
march
and
crossed
the
glacier
keeping
the
twenty
feet
of
rope
which
separated
each
person
extended
once
jean
looked
back
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
for
he
saw
chayne
and
his
guides
following
across
the
glacier
behind
and
chayne
road
to
the
col
dolent
at
the
head
of
the
glacier
lay
straight
ahead
upon
their
former
line
of
advance
however
he
said
nothing
they
crossed
the
bergschrund
with
less
difficulty
than
they
had
anticipated
and
ascending
a
ridge
of
debris
by
the
side
of
the
lateral
glacier
which
descended
from
the
cliffs
of
the
aiguille
they
advanced
into
the
bay
under
the
southern
wall
of
the
aiguille
du
chardonnet
on
the
top
of
this
moraine
jean
halted
and
the
party
breakfasted
and
while
they
breakfasted
chayne
told
sylvia
something
of
that
mountain
history
it
is
not
the
most
difficult
of
peaks
said
he
but
it
has
associations
which
some
of
the
new
have
not
the
pioneers
came
here
right
behind
them
there
was
a
gap
the
pass
between
their
mountain
and
the
aiguille
du
chardonnet
from
that
pass
moore
and
whymper
first
tried
to
reach
the
top
by
following
the
crest
of
the
cliffs
but
they
found
it
impracticable
whymper
tried
again
but
this
time
up
the
face
of
the
cliffs
further
on
to
the
south
and
just
to
the
left
of
the
summit
he
failed
came
back
again
and
conquered
we
follow
his
road
and
while
they
looked
up
the
dead
white
of
that
rounded
summit
ridge
changed
to
a
warm
rosy
color
and
all
about
that
basin
the
topmost
peaks
took
fire
it
is
the
sun
said
he
sylvia
looked
across
the
valley
the
great
of
the
aiguille
verte
flashed
and
sparkled
the
slopes
of
the
les
droites
and
mont
dolent
were
hung
with
jewels
even
the
black
precipices
of
the
tour
noir
grew
warm
and
friendly
but
at
the
head
of
the
glacier
a
sheer
unbroken
wall
of
rock
swept
round
in
the
segment
of
a
circle
and
this
remained
still
dead
black
and
the
glacier
at
its
foot
dead
white
at
one
point
in
the
edge
of
this
wall
there
was
a
depression
and
from
the
depression
a
riband
of
ice
ran
as
it
seemed
from
where
they
sat
perpendicularly
down
to
the
glacier
that
is
the
col
dolent
said
chayne
very
little
sunlight
ever
creeps
down
there
sylvia
shivered
as
she
looked
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
somber
so
sinister
as
that
precipitous
curtain
of
rock
and
its
riband
of
ice
it
looked
like
a
white
band
painted
on
a
black
wall
it
looks
very
dangerous
she
said
slowly
it
needs
care
said
chayne
especially
this
year
when
there
is
so
little
snow
added
sylvia
yes
twelve
hundred
feet
of
ice
at
an
angle
of
fifty
degrees
and
the
bergschrund
just
beneath
yes
you
must
not
slip
on
the
col
dolent
said
he
quietly
sylvia
was
silent
a
little
while
then
she
said
with
a
slight
hesitation
and
you
cross
that
pass
there
was
still
more
hesitation
in
chayne
voice
as
he
answered
well
no
you
see
this
is
your
first
mountain
and
you
have
only
two
guides
sylvia
looked
at
him
seriously
how
many
should
i
have
taken
for
the
aiguille
twelve
chayne
smiled
feebly
well
no
and
his
confusion
increased
two
as
a
rule
are
enough
unless
unless
the
amateur
is
very
clumsy
she
added
thank
you
captain
chayne
i
did
mean
that
he
cried
he
had
no
idea
whether
she
was
angry
or
not
she
was
just
looking
quietly
and
steadily
into
his
face
and
waiting
for
his
explanation
well
the
truth
is
he
blurted
out
i
wanted
to
go
up
the
aiguille
with
you
and
he
saw
a
smile
dimple
her
cheeks
i
am
honored
she
said
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
showed
besides
that
she
was
very
glad
oh
but
it
was
only
for
the
sake
of
your
company
he
said
and
stopped
i
do
seem
to
be
very
polite
do
i
he
said
lamentably
not
very
she
replied
what
i
mean
is
this
he
explained
ever
since
we
started
this
morning
i
have
been
recapturing
my
own
sensations
on
my
first
ascent
watching
you
your
enjoyment
your
eagerness
to
live
fully
every
moment
of
this
day
i
almost
feel
as
if
i
too
had
come
fresh
to
the
mountains
as
if
the
argentière
were
my
first
peak
he
saw
the
blood
mount
into
her
cheeks
was
that
the
reason
why
you
questioned
me
as
to
what
i
thought
and
felt
she
asked
yes
i
thought
you
were
testing
me
she
said
slowly
i
thought
you
were
trying
whether
i
was
worthy
and
once
again
humility
had
framed
her
words
and
modulated
their
utterance
she
recognized
without
rancor
but
in
distress
that
people
had
the
right
to
look
on
her
as
without
the
pale
the
guides
packed
up
the
and
they
started
once
more
up
the
moraine
in
a
little
while
they
descended
on
to
the
lateral
glacier
which
descending
from
the
recesses
of
the
aiguille
in
front
of
them
flowed
into
the
great
basin
behind
they
roped
together
now
in
one
party
and
ascended
the
glacier
diagonally
rounding
a
great
buttress
which
descends
from
the
rock
ledge
and
bisects
the
ice
and
drawing
close
to
the
steep
cliffs
in
a
little
while
they
crossed
the
bergschrund
from
the
glacier
on
to
the
wall
of
mountain
and
traversing
by
easy
rocks
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
came
at
last
to
a
big
steep
gully
filled
with
hard
ice
which
led
up
to
the
ridge
just
below
the
final
peak
this
is
our
way
said
jean
we
ascend
by
the
rocks
at
the
side
they
breakfasted
again
and
began
to
ascend
the
rocks
to
the
left
of
the
great
gully
sylvia
following
second
behind
her
leading
guide
the
rocks
were
not
difficult
but
they
were
very
steep
and
at
times
loose
moreover
jean
climbed
fast
and
sylvia
had
much
ado
to
keep
pace
with
him
but
she
would
not
call
on
him
to
slacken
his
pace
and
she
was
most
anxious
not
to
come
up
on
the
rope
but
to
climb
with
her
own
hands
and
feet
this
they
ascended
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
and
jean
halted
on
a
convenient
ledge
sylvia
had
time
to
look
down
she
had
climbed
with
her
face
to
the
wall
of
rock
her
eyes
searching
quickly
for
her
holds
fixing
her
feet
securely
gripping
firmly
with
her
hands
avoiding
the
loose
boulders
moreover
the
rope
had
worried
her
when
she
had
left
it
at
its
length
between
herself
and
the
guide
in
front
of
her
it
would
hang
about
her
feet
threatening
to
trip
her
or
catch
as
though
in
active
malice
in
any
crack
which
happened
to
be
handy
if
she
shortened
it
and
held
it
in
her
hands
there
would
come
a
sudden
tug
from
above
as
the
leader
raised
himself
from
one
ledge
to
another
which
almost
overset
her
now
however
flushed
with
her
exertion
and
glad
to
draw
her
breath
at
her
ease
she
looked
down
and
was
astonished
so
far
below
her
already
seemed
the
glacier
she
had
left
so
steep
the
rocks
up
which
she
had
climbed
you
are
not
tired
said
chayne
sylvia
laughed
tired
when
a
dream
was
growing
real
when
she
was
actually
on
the
mountain
face
she
turned
her
face
again
to
the
and
in
a
little
more
than
an
hour
after
leaving
the
foot
of
the
gully
she
stepped
out
on
to
a
patch
of
snow
on
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
she
stood
in
sunlight
and
all
the
country
to
the
east
was
suddenly
unrolled
before
her
eyes
a
moment
before
and
her
face
was
to
the
rock
now
at
her
feet
the
steep
dropped
to
the
glacier
of
saleinaz
the
crags
of
the
aiguille
dorées
and
some
green
uplands
gave
color
to
the
glittering
world
of
ice
and
far
away
towered
the
white
peaks
of
the
grand
combin
and
the
weisshorn
in
a
blue
cloudless
sky
and
to
the
left
over
the
summit
of
the
grande
fourche
she
saw
the
huge
embattlements
of
the
oberland
she
stood
absorbed
while
the
rest
of
the
party
ascended
to
her
side
she
hardly
knew
indeed
that
they
were
there
until
chayne
standing
by
her
asked
you
are
not
disappointed
she
made
no
reply
she
had
no
words
wherewith
to
express
the
emotion
which
troubled
her
to
the
depths
they
rested
for
a
while
on
this
level
patch
of
snow
to
their
right
the
ridge
ran
sharply
up
to
the
summit
but
not
by
that
ridge
was
the
summit
to
be
reached
they
turned
over
on
to
the
eastern
face
of
the
mountain
and
traversed
in
a
straight
line
across
the
great
which
sweeps
down
in
one
white
unbroken
curtain
toward
the
glacier
of
saleinaz
their
order
had
been
changed
first
jean
advanced
chayne
followed
and
after
him
came
sylvia
the
leading
guide
kicked
a
step
or
two
in
the
snow
then
he
used
the
adz
of
his
ax
a
few
steps
still
and
he
halted
ice
he
said
and
from
that
spot
to
the
mountain
top
he
used
the
pick
the
slope
was
at
a
steep
angle
the
ice
very
hard
and
each
step
had
to
be
cut
with
care
especially
on
the
traverse
where
the
whole
party
moved
across
the
mountain
upon
the
same
level
and
there
was
no
friendly
hand
above
to
give
a
pull
upon
the
rope
the
slope
ran
steeply
down
beneath
them
then
curved
over
a
brow
and
steepened
yet
more
are
the
steps
near
enough
together
chayne
asked
yes
she
replied
though
she
had
to
stretch
in
her
stride
and
upon
that
jean
dug
his
pick
in
the
slope
at
his
side
and
turned
round
lean
well
way
from
the
slope
mademoiselle
not
toward
it
there
is
less
chance
then
of
slipping
from
the
steps
he
said
anxiously
and
there
came
a
look
of
surprise
upon
his
face
for
he
saw
that
already
of
her
own
thought
she
was
standing
straight
in
her
steps
thrusting
herself
out
from
the
slope
by
pressing
the
pick
of
her
ax
against
it
at
the
level
of
her
waist
and
more
than
once
thereafter
jean
turned
about
and
watched
her
with
a
growing
perplexity
chayne
looked
to
see
whether
her
face
showed
any
sign
of
fear
on
the
contrary
she
was
looking
down
that
great
sweep
of
ice
with
an
actual
exultation
and
it
was
not
ignorance
which
allowed
her
to
exult
the
evident
anxiety
of
chayne
words
and
the
silence
which
since
had
fallen
upon
one
and
all
were
alone
enough
to
assure
her
that
here
was
serious
work
but
she
had
been
reading
deeply
of
the
alps
and
in
all
the
histories
of
mountain
exploits
which
she
had
read
of
climbs
up
vertical
cracks
in
sheer
walls
of
rocks
balancings
upon
ridges
sharp
as
a
knife
edge
crawlings
over
smooth
slabs
with
nowhere
to
rest
the
feet
or
hands
it
was
the
which
had
most
kindled
her
imagination
the
steep
smooth
long
white
upon
the
surface
or
even
black
where
the
ax
had
cut
the
step
the
place
where
no
slip
must
be
made
she
had
lain
awake
at
nights
listening
to
the
roar
of
the
streets
beneath
her
window
and
picturing
it
now
sleeping
in
the
sunlight
now
enwreathed
in
mists
which
opened
and
showed
still
higher
heights
and
still
lower
depths
now
whipped
angrily
with
winds
which
tore
off
the
surface
icicles
and
snow
and
sent
them
swirling
like
smoke
about
the
shoulders
of
the
peak
she
had
dreamed
herself
on
to
it
half
shrinking
half
eager
and
now
she
was
actually
upon
one
and
she
felt
no
fear
she
could
not
but
exult
the
sunlight
was
hot
upon
this
face
of
the
mountain
yet
her
feet
grew
cold
as
she
stood
patiently
in
her
steps
advancing
slowly
as
the
man
before
her
moved
once
as
she
stood
she
moved
her
foot
and
scratched
the
sole
of
her
boot
on
the
ice
to
level
a
roughness
in
the
step
and
at
once
she
saw
chayne
and
the
guide
in
front
drive
the
picks
of
their
axes
hard
into
the
slope
at
their
side
and
stand
tense
as
if
expecting
a
jerk
upon
the
rope
afterward
they
both
looked
round
at
her
and
seeing
she
was
safe
turned
back
again
to
their
work
the
guide
cutting
the
steps
chayne
polishing
them
behind
him
in
a
little
while
the
guide
turned
his
face
to
the
slope
and
cut
upward
instead
of
across
the
slope
was
so
steep
that
instead
of
cutting
zigzags
across
its
face
he
chopped
pigeon
holes
straight
up
they
moved
from
one
to
the
other
as
on
a
ladder
and
their
knees
touched
the
ice
as
they
stood
upright
in
the
steps
for
a
couple
of
hours
the
axes
never
ceased
and
then
the
leader
made
two
or
three
extra
steps
at
the
side
of
the
staircase
on
to
one
of
them
he
moved
out
chayne
went
up
and
joined
him
come
mademoiselle
he
said
and
he
drew
in
the
rope
as
sylvia
advanced
she
climbed
up
level
with
them
on
the
ladder
and
waited
not
knowing
why
they
stood
aside
go
on
mademoiselle
said
the
guide
she
took
another
step
or
two
upon
snow
and
uttered
a
cry
she
had
looked
suddenly
over
the
top
of
the
mountain
on
to
the
aiguille
verte
and
the
great
pile
of
mont
blanc
even
as
revailloud
had
told
her
that
she
would
the
guide
had
stood
aside
that
she
might
be
the
first
to
step
out
upon
the
summit
of
the
mountain
she
stood
upon
the
narrow
ridge
of
snow
at
her
feet
the
plastered
with
bulging
masses
of
ice
fell
sheer
to
the
glacier
her
first
glance
was
downward
to
the
col
dolent
even
at
this
hour
when
the
basin
of
the
valley
was
filled
with
sunshine
that
one
corner
at
the
head
of
the
glacier
was
still
dead
white
dead
black
she
shivered
once
more
as
she
looked
at
it
so
grim
and
so
menacing
the
seemed
so
hard
and
steep
the
riband
of
ice
then
chayne
joined
her
on
the
ridge
they
sat
down
and
ate
their
meal
and
lay
for
an
hour
sunning
themselves
in
the
clear
air
you
could
have
had
no
better
day
said
chayne
only
a
few
white
scarfs
of
cloud
flitted
here
and
there
across
the
sky
and
their
shadows
chased
each
other
across
the
glittering
slopes
of
ice
and
snow
the
triangle
of
the
aiguille
verte
was
over
against
her
the
beautiful
ridges
of
les
courtes
and
les
droites
to
her
right
and
beyond
them
the
massive
domes
and
buttresses
of
the
great
white
mountain
sylvia
lay
upon
the
eastern
slope
of
the
argentière
looking
over
the
brow
not
wanting
to
speak
and
certainly
not
listening
to
any
word
that
was
uttered
her
soul
was
at
peace
the
tension
of
mind
and
muscle
the
excitement
of
that
last
both
were
over
and
had
brought
their
reward
she
looked
out
upon
a
still
and
peaceful
world
wonderfully
bright
wonderfully
beautiful
and
wonderfully
colored
here
a
spire
would
pierce
the
sunlight
with
slabs
of
red
rock
interspersed
amongst
its
gray
there
sparkled
as
though
strewn
with
jewels
bulged
out
in
great
green
knobs
showed
now
a
grim
gray
now
a
transparent
blue
at
times
a
distant
rumble
like
thunder
far
away
told
that
the
were
hurling
their
avalanches
down
once
or
twice
she
heard
a
great
roar
near
at
hand
and
chayne
pointing
across
the
valleys
would
show
her
what
seemed
to
be
a
handful
of
small
stones
whizzing
down
the
rocks
and
of
the
aiguille
verte
but
on
the
whole
this
new
world
was
silent
communing
with
the
heavens
she
was
in
the
hushed
company
of
the
mountains
days
there
would
be
when
these
sunlit
ridges
would
be
mere
blurs
of
driving
storm
when
the
wind
would
shriek
about
the
gullies
and
dark
mists
swirl
around
the
peaks
but
on
this
morning
there
was
no
anger
on
the
heights
yes
you
could
have
had
no
better
day
for
your
first
mountain
mademoiselle
said
jean
as
he
stood
beside
her
but
this
is
not
your
first
mountain
she
turned
to
him
yes
it
is
her
guide
bowed
to
her
then
mademoiselle
you
have
great
gifts
for
you
stood
upon
that
and
moved
along
and
up
it
as
only
people
of
experience
stand
and
move
i
noticed
you
on
the
rocks
too
you
had
the
instinct
for
the
and
the
foothold
and
with
which
foot
to
take
the
step
and
that
instinct
mademoiselle
comes
as
a
rule
only
with
practice
he
paused
and
looked
at
her
perplexity
moreover
mademoiselle
you
remind
me
of
some
one
he
added
i
can
not
remember
who
it
is
or
why
you
remind
me
of
him
but
you
remind
me
of
some
one
very
much
he
picked
up
the
which
he
had
taken
from
his
shoulders
it
was
half
past
eleven
sylvia
took
a
last
look
over
the
wide
prospect
of
jagged
ridge
ice
pinnacles
and
rock
spires
she
looked
down
once
more
upon
the
slim
snow
peak
of
mont
dolent
and
the
grim
wall
of
rocks
at
the
i
shall
never
forget
this
she
said
with
shining
eyes
never
the
fascination
of
the
mountains
was
upon
her
something
new
had
come
into
her
life
that
morning
which
would
never
fail
her
to
the
very
end
which
would
color
all
her
days
however
dull
which
would
give
her
memories
in
which
to
find
solace
longings
wherewith
to
plan
the
future
this
she
felt
and
some
of
this
her
friend
understood
yes
he
said
you
understand
the
difference
it
makes
to
one
whole
life
each
year
passes
so
quickly
looking
back
and
looking
forward
yes
i
understand
she
said
you
will
come
back
but
this
time
she
did
not
answer
at
once
she
stood
looking
thoughtfully
out
over
the
bridge
of
the
argentière
it
seemed
to
chayne
that
she
was
coming
slowly
to
some
great
decision
which
would
somehow
affect
all
her
life
then
she
said
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
made
her
decision
i
do
not
know
perhaps
i
never
shall
come
back
they
turned
away
and
went
carefully
down
the
slope
again
her
leading
guide
who
on
the
return
journey
went
last
was
perplexed
by
that
instinct
for
the
mountain
side
which
had
surprised
him
the
technique
came
to
her
so
naturally
she
turned
her
back
to
the
slope
and
thus
descended
she
knew
just
the
right
level
at
which
to
drive
in
the
pick
of
her
ax
that
she
might
lower
herself
to
the
next
hole
in
their
finally
as
they
came
down
the
rocks
by
the
great
couloir
to
the
glacier
he
cried
out
ah
now
mademoiselle
i
know
who
it
is
you
remind
me
of
i
have
been
watching
you
i
know
now
she
looked
up
who
is
it
an
english
gentleman
i
once
climbed
with
for
a
whole
season
many
years
ago
a
great
climber
mademoiselle
captain
chayne
will
know
his
name
gabriel
strood
gabriel
strood
she
cried
and
then
she
laughed
i
too
know
his
name
you
are
flattering
me
jean
but
jean
would
not
admit
it
i
am
not
mademoiselle
he
insisted
i
do
not
say
you
have
his
skill
how
should
you
but
there
are
certain
movements
certain
neat
ways
of
putting
the
hands
and
feet
yes
mademoiselle
you
remind
me
of
him
sylvia
thought
no
more
of
his
words
at
the
moment
they
reached
the
lateral
glacier
descended
it
and
crossed
the
glacier
they
found
their
pathway
of
the
morning
and
at
three
stood
once
more
upon
the
platform
in
front
of
the
pavillon
de
lognan
then
she
rested
for
a
while
saying
very
little
you
are
tired
he
said
no
she
replied
but
this
day
has
made
a
great
difference
to
me
her
guides
approached
her
and
she
said
no
more
upon
the
point
but
chayne
had
no
doubt
that
she
was
referring
to
that
decision
which
she
had
taken
on
the
summit
of
the
peak
she
stood
up
to
go
you
stay
here
she
said
yes
you
cross
the
col
dolent
yes
she
looked
at
him
quickly
and
then
away
you
will
be
careful
in
the
shadow
there
yes
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
looking
up
the
glacier
toward
the
aiguille
i
thank
you
very
much
for
coming
with
me
and
again
the
humility
in
her
voice
as
of
one
outside
the
door
touched
and
hurt
him
i
am
very
grateful
and
here
a
smile
lightened
her
grave
face
and
i
am
rather
proud
you
came
up
to
lognan
at
a
good
time
for
me
he
answered
as
they
shook
hands
i
shall
cross
the
col
dolent
with
a
better
heart
they
shook
hands
and
he
asked
shall
i
see
no
more
of
you
that
is
as
you
will
she
replied
simply
i
should
like
to
in
paris
perhaps
or
wherever
you
are
likely
to
be
i
am
on
leave
now
for
some
months
she
thought
for
a
second
or
two
then
she
said
if
you
will
give
me
your
address
i
will
write
to
you
i
think
i
shall
be
in
england
i
live
in
sussex
on
the
south
downs
she
took
his
card
and
as
she
turned
away
she
pointed
to
the
aiguille
i
shall
dream
of
that
surely
not
he
replied
laughing
down
to
her
over
the
wooden
balustrade
you
will
dream
of
running
water
she
glanced
up
at
him
in
surprise
that
he
should
have
remembered
this
strange
quality
of
hers
then
she
turned
away
and
went
down
to
the
pine
woods
and
the
village
of
les
tines
chapter
viii
sylvia
parts
from
her
mother
meanwhile
thesiger
laughed
her
shrill
laugh
and
chatted
noisily
in
the
garden
of
the
hotel
she
picnicked
on
the
day
of
sylvia
ascent
amongst
the
sham
ruins
on
the
road
to
sallanches
with
a
few
detached
idlers
of
various
nationalities
quite
quite
charming
she
cried
and
she
rippled
with
enthusiasm
over
the
artificial
lake
and
the
artificial
rocks
amongst
which
she
seemed
so
appropriate
a
figure
and
she
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
over
the
eccentricities
of
her
daughter
who
was
undoubtedly
burning
her
complexion
to
the
color
of
among
those
stupid
mountains
she
came
back
a
trifle
flushed
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
slipped
discreetly
into
the
little
cercle
at
the
back
of
the
casino
where
she
played
baccarat
in
a
company
which
flattery
could
hardly
have
termed
doubtful
she
was
indeed
not
displeased
to
be
rid
of
her
unsatisfactory
daughter
for
a
night
and
a
couple
of
days
sylvia
wo
fit
in
thus
for
a
long
time
she
had
been
accustomed
piteously
to
complain
and
with
ever
more
reason
less
and
less
did
sylvia
fit
in
with
thesiger
scheme
of
life
it
was
not
that
the
girl
resisted
or
complained
thesiger
would
have
understood
objections
and
complaints
she
would
not
have
minded
them
she
could
have
coped
with
them
there
would
have
been
little
scenes
with
accusations
of
ingratitude
of
undutifulness
and
thesiger
was
not
averse
to
the
excitement
of
little
scenes
but
sylvia
never
complained
she
maintained
a
reserve
a
mystery
which
her
mother
found
very
uncomfortable
she
has
no
sympathy
said
thesiger
moreover
she
would
grow
up
and
she
would
grow
up
in
beauty
and
in
freshness
thesiger
did
her
best
she
kept
her
dressed
in
a
style
which
suited
a
younger
girl
or
rather
which
would
have
suited
a
younger
girl
had
it
been
less
decorative
and
extreme
again
sylvia
did
not
complain
she
followed
her
usual
practice
and
shut
her
mind
to
the
things
which
displeased
her
so
completely
that
they
ceased
to
trouble
her
but
thesiger
never
knew
that
secret
and
often
when
in
the
midst
of
her
chatter
she
threw
a
glance
at
the
elaborate
figure
of
her
daughter
sitting
apart
with
her
lace
skirts
too
short
her
heels
too
high
her
hat
too
big
and
too
fancifully
trimmed
she
would
see
her
face
turned
toward
her
and
her
dark
eyes
thoughtfully
dwelling
upon
her
at
such
times
there
would
come
an
uncomfortable
sensation
that
she
was
being
weighed
and
found
wanting
or
a
question
would
leap
in
her
mind
and
bring
with
it
fear
and
the
same
question
which
she
had
asked
herself
in
the
train
on
the
way
to
chamonix
you
ask
me
about
my
daughter
she
once
exclaimed
pettishly
to
monsieur
pettigrat
upon
my
word
i
really
know
nothing
of
her
except
one
ridiculous
thing
she
always
dreams
of
running
water
now
i
ask
you
what
can
you
do
with
a
daughter
so
absurd
that
she
dreams
of
running
water
monsieur
pettigrat
was
a
big
broad
uncommon
man
he
knew
that
he
was
uncommon
and
dressed
accordingly
in
a
cloak
and
a
brigand
hat
he
saw
what
others
did
not
and
spoke
in
a
manner
suitably
impressive
i
will
tell
you
madame
about
your
daughter
he
said
somberly
to
me
she
has
a
fated
look
thesiger
was
a
little
consoled
to
think
that
she
had
a
daughter
with
a
fated
look
i
wonder
if
others
have
noticed
it
she
said
cheerfully
no
replied
monsieur
pettigrat
no
others
only
i
there
that
just
like
sylvia
cried
thesiger
in
exasperation
she
has
a
fated
look
and
makes
nothing
of
it
but
the
secret
of
her
discontent
was
just
a
woman
jealousy
of
a
younger
rival
men
were
beginning
to
turn
from
her
toward
her
daughter
that
sylvia
never
competed
only
made
the
sting
the
sharper
the
grave
face
with
its
perfect
oval
which
smiled
so
rarely
but
in
so
winning
a
way
its
delicate
color
its
freshness
were
points
which
she
could
not
forgive
her
daughter
she
felt
faded
and
yellow
beside
her
she
rouged
more
heavily
on
account
of
her
she
looked
with
more
apprehension
at
the
which
were
beginning
to
show
about
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
the
lines
which
were
beginning
to
run
from
the
nostrils
to
the
corners
of
her
mouth
sylvia
reached
the
hotel
in
time
for
dinner
and
as
she
sat
with
her
mother
drinking
her
coffee
in
the
garden
afterward
monsieur
pettigrat
planted
himself
before
the
little
iron
table
he
shook
his
head
which
was
what
his
friends
called
leonine
mademoiselle
he
said
in
his
most
impressive
voice
i
envy
you
sylvia
looked
up
at
him
with
a
little
smile
of
mischief
upon
her
lips
and
why
monsieur
he
waved
his
arm
magnificently
i
watched
you
at
dinner
you
are
of
the
elect
mademoiselle
for
whom
the
snow
peaks
have
a
message
sylvia
smile
faded
from
her
face
perhaps
so
monsieur
she
said
gravely
and
her
mother
interposed
testily
a
message
ridiculous
there
are
only
two
words
in
the
message
my
dear
and
be
sure
you
put
it
on
your
face
before
you
go
to
bed
sylvia
apparently
did
not
hear
her
mother
comment
at
all
events
she
disregarded
it
and
monsieur
pettigrat
once
again
shook
his
head
at
sylvia
with
a
kindly
magnificence
they
have
no
message
for
me
mademoiselle
he
said
with
a
sigh
as
though
he
for
once
regretted
that
he
was
so
uncommon
i
once
went
up
there
to
see
he
waved
his
hand
generally
to
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
and
drifted
largely
away
thesiger
however
was
to
hear
more
definitely
of
that
message
two
days
later
it
was
after
dinner
she
was
sitting
in
the
garden
with
her
daughter
on
a
night
of
moonlight
behind
them
rose
the
wall
of
mountains
silent
and
shadowed
in
front
were
the
lights
of
the
little
town
and
the
clatter
of
its
crowded
streets
between
the
town
and
the
mountains
at
the
side
of
the
hotel
this
garden
lay
a
garden
of
grass
and
trees
where
the
moonlight
slept
in
white
brilliant
pools
of
light
or
dripped
between
the
leaves
of
the
branches
it
partook
alike
of
the
silence
of
the
hills
and
the
noise
of
the
town
for
a
murmur
of
voices
was
audible
from
this
and
that
point
and
under
the
shadows
of
the
trees
could
be
seen
the
glimmer
of
frocks
and
the
glow
of
cigars
waxing
and
waning
a
waiter
came
across
the
garden
with
some
letters
for
thesiger
there
were
none
for
sylvia
and
she
was
used
to
none
for
she
had
no
girl
friends
and
though
at
times
men
wrote
her
letters
she
did
not
answer
them
a
lamp
burned
near
at
hand
thesiger
opened
her
letters
and
read
them
she
threw
them
on
to
the
table
when
she
had
read
them
through
but
there
was
one
which
angered
her
and
replacing
it
in
its
envelope
she
tossed
it
so
petulantly
aside
that
it
slid
off
the
iron
table
and
fell
at
sylvia
feet
sylvia
stooped
and
picked
it
up
it
had
fallen
face
upward
this
is
from
my
father
thesiger
looked
up
startled
it
was
the
first
time
that
sylvia
had
ever
spoken
of
him
to
her
a
wariness
come
into
her
eyes
well
she
asked
i
want
to
go
to
him
sylvia
spoke
very
simply
and
gently
looking
straight
into
her
face
with
that
perplexing
steadiness
of
gaze
which
told
so
very
little
of
what
thoughts
were
busy
behind
it
her
mother
turned
her
face
aside
she
was
rather
frightened
for
a
while
she
made
no
reply
at
all
but
her
face
beneath
its
paint
looked
haggard
and
old
in
the
white
light
and
she
raised
her
hand
to
her
heart
when
she
did
speak
her
voice
shook
you
have
never
seen
your
father
he
has
never
seen
you
he
and
i
parted
before
you
were
born
but
he
writes
to
you
yes
he
writes
to
me
and
for
all
that
she
tried
she
could
not
altogether
keep
a
tone
of
contempt
out
of
her
voice
she
added
with
some
cruelty
but
he
never
mentions
you
he
has
never
once
inquired
after
you
never
once
sylvia
looked
very
wistfully
at
the
letter
but
her
purpose
was
not
shaken
mother
i
want
to
go
to
him
she
persisted
her
lips
trembled
a
little
and
with
a
choke
of
the
voice
a
sob
half
caught
back
she
added
i
am
most
unhappy
here
the
rarity
of
a
complaint
from
sylvia
moved
her
mother
strangely
there
was
a
forlornness
moreover
in
her
appealing
attitude
just
for
a
moment
thesiger
began
to
think
of
early
days
of
which
the
memory
was
at
once
a
pain
and
a
reproach
a
certain
little
village
underneath
the
great
white
horse
on
the
dorsetshire
downs
rose
with
a
disturbing
vividness
before
her
eyes
she
almost
heard
the
mill
stream
babble
by
in
that
village
of
sutton
poyntz
she
had
herself
been
born
and
to
it
she
had
returned
caught
back
again
for
a
little
while
by
her
own
country
and
her
youth
that
sylvia
might
be
born
there
too
these
months
had
made
a
kind
of
green
oasis
in
her
life
she
had
rested
there
in
a
after
a
time
of
much
turbulence
with
the
music
of
running
water
night
and
day
in
her
ears
a
garden
of
flowers
and
grass
about
her
and
the
downs
with
the
hollows
and
brown
treeless
slopes
rising
up
from
her
very
feet
she
could
not
but
think
of
that
short
time
of
peace
and
her
voice
softened
as
she
answered
her
daughter
we
do
keep
step
sylvia
she
said
with
an
uneasy
laugh
i
know
that
but
after
all
would
you
be
happier
with
your
father
even
if
he
wants
to
keep
you
you
have
all
you
want
here
frocks
amusement
companions
try
to
be
more
friendly
with
people
but
sylvia
merely
shook
her
head
i
ca
go
on
any
longer
like
this
she
said
slowly
i
ca
mother
if
my
father
wo
have
me
i
must
see
what
i
can
do
of
course
i
do
much
i
do
know
anything
but
i
am
too
unhappy
here
i
can
not
endure
the
life
we
are
living
without
a
home
or
respect
sylvia
had
not
meant
to
use
that
word
but
it
had
slipped
out
before
she
was
aware
she
broke
off
and
turned
her
eyes
again
to
her
mother
they
were
very
bright
for
the
moonlight
glistened
upon
tears
but
the
softness
had
gone
from
her
mother
face
she
had
grown
in
a
moment
hard
and
her
voice
rang
hard
as
she
asked
why
do
you
think
that
your
father
and
i
parted
come
let
me
hear
sylvia
turned
her
head
away
i
do
think
about
it
she
said
gently
i
do
want
to
think
about
it
i
just
think
that
he
left
you
because
you
did
not
keep
step
either
oh
he
left
me
not
i
him
then
why
does
he
write
to
me
the
voice
was
growing
harder
with
every
word
i
suppose
because
he
is
kind
and
at
that
simple
explanation
mother
laughed
with
a
bitter
amusement
sylvia
sat
scraping
the
gravel
with
her
slipper
do
do
that
cried
her
mother
irritably
then
she
asked
suddenly
a
question
which
startled
her
daughter
did
you
meet
any
one
last
night
on
the
mountain
at
the
inn
sylvia
face
colored
but
the
moonlight
hid
the
change
yes
she
said
a
man
yes
who
was
it
a
captain
chayne
he
was
at
the
hotel
all
last
week
it
was
his
friend
who
was
killed
on
the
glacier
des
nantillons
were
you
alone
at
the
inn
you
and
he
yes
did
he
know
your
father
sylvia
stared
at
her
mother
i
do
know
i
suppose
not
how
should
he
it
not
impossible
replied
thesiger
then
she
leaned
on
the
table
it
was
he
who
put
these
ideas
into
your
head
about
going
away
about
leaving
me
she
made
an
accusation
rather
than
put
a
question
and
made
it
angrily
no
mother
sylvia
replied
he
never
spoke
of
you
the
ideas
have
been
growing
in
my
mind
for
a
long
time
and
she
raised
her
head
and
turning
slightly
looked
up
to
where
just
behind
her
the
of
the
aiguilles
du
midi
and
de
blaitière
soared
into
the
moonlit
sky
the
end
came
i
became
certain
that
i
must
go
away
i
am
very
sorry
mother
the
message
of
the
mountains
said
her
mother
with
a
sneer
and
sylvia
answered
quietly
yes
very
well
said
thesiger
she
had
been
deeply
stung
by
her
daughter
words
by
her
wish
to
go
and
if
she
delayed
her
consent
it
was
chiefly
through
a
hankering
to
punish
sylvia
but
the
thought
came
to
her
that
she
would
punish
sylvia
more
completely
if
she
let
her
go
she
smiled
cruelly
as
she
looked
at
the
girl
pure
and
gentle
face
and
after
all
she
herself
would
be
free
free
from
sylvia
unconscious
rivalry
free
from
the
competition
of
her
freshness
and
her
youth
free
from
the
grave
criticism
of
her
eyes
very
well
you
shall
go
to
your
father
but
remember
you
have
made
your
choice
you
must
come
whining
back
to
me
because
i
wo
have
you
she
said
brutally
you
shall
go
she
took
the
letter
from
its
envelope
but
she
did
not
show
it
to
her
daughter
i
do
use
your
father
name
she
said
i
have
not
used
it
since
and
again
the
cruel
smile
appeared
upon
her
lips
since
he
left
me
as
you
say
he
is
called
garratt
skinner
and
he
lives
in
a
little
house
in
hobart
place
yes
you
shall
start
for
your
home
sylvia
stood
up
thank
you
she
said
she
looked
wistfully
at
her
mother
asking
her
pardon
with
the
look
but
she
did
not
approach
her
she
stood
sadly
in
front
of
her
thesiger
made
no
advance
well
she
asked
in
her
hard
cold
voice
thank
you
mother
sylvia
repeated
and
she
walked
slowly
to
the
door
of
the
hotel
she
looked
up
to
the
mountains
needle
spires
of
rock
glistening
pinnacles
of
ice
they
stood
dreaming
to
the
moonlight
and
the
stars
the
great
step
had
been
taken
she
prayed
for
something
of
their
calm
something
of
their
proud
indifference
to
storm
and
sunshine
solitude
and
company
she
went
up
to
her
room
and
began
to
pack
her
trunks
and
as
she
packed
the
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
fell
meanwhile
her
mother
sat
in
the
garden
so
sylvia
wanted
a
home
she
could
not
endure
the
life
she
lived
with
her
mother
afar
off
a
band
played
the
streets
beyond
were
noisy
as
a
river
beneath
the
trees
of
the
garden
here
people
talked
quietly
thesiger
sat
with
a
little
vindictive
smile
upon
her
face
her
rival
was
going
to
be
punished
thesiger
had
left
her
husband
not
he
her
she
read
through
the
letter
which
she
had
received
from
him
this
evening
it
was
a
pressing
request
for
money
she
was
not
going
to
send
him
money
she
wondered
how
he
would
appreciate
the
present
of
a
daughter
instead
chapter
ix
sylvia
makes
the
acquaintance
of
her
father
sylvia
left
chamonix
the
next
afternoon
it
was
a
saturday
and
she
stepped
out
of
her
on
to
the
platform
of
victoria
station
at
seven
on
the
sunday
evening
she
was
tired
by
her
long
journey
and
she
felt
rather
lonely
as
she
waited
for
her
trunks
to
be
passed
by
the
officers
of
the
it
was
her
very
first
visit
to
london
and
there
was
not
one
person
to
meet
her
other
travelers
were
being
welcomed
on
all
sides
by
their
friends
no
one
in
all
london
expected
her
she
doubted
if
she
had
one
single
acquaintance
in
the
whole
town
her
mother
foreseeing
this
very
moment
had
with
a
subtlety
of
malice
refrained
from
so
much
as
sending
a
telegram
to
the
girl
father
and
sylvia
herself
not
knowing
him
had
kept
silence
too
since
he
did
not
expect
her
she
thought
her
better
plan
was
to
see
him
or
rather
since
her
thoughts
were
frank
to
let
him
see
her
her
mirror
had
assured
her
that
her
looks
would
be
a
better
introduction
than
a
telegram
she
had
her
boxes
placed
upon
a
cab
and
drove
off
to
hobart
place
the
sense
of
loneliness
soon
left
her
she
was
buoyed
up
by
excitement
the
novelty
of
the
streets
amused
her
moreover
she
had
invented
her
father
clothed
him
with
many
qualities
as
with
shining
raiment
and
set
him
high
among
the
persons
of
her
dreams
would
he
be
satisfied
with
his
daughter
that
was
her
fear
and
with
the
help
of
the
at
the
side
of
her
hansom
she
tried
to
remove
the
traces
of
travel
from
her
young
face
the
cab
stopped
at
a
door
in
a
narrow
wall
between
two
houses
and
she
got
out
over
the
wall
she
saw
the
green
leaves
and
branches
of
a
few
lime
trees
which
rose
from
a
little
garden
and
at
the
end
of
the
garden
in
the
far
recess
between
the
two
side
walls
the
upper
windows
of
a
little
neat
white
house
sylvia
was
charmed
with
it
she
rang
the
bell
and
a
servant
came
to
the
door
is
skinner
in
asked
sylvia
yes
she
said
doubtfully
but
sylvia
however
had
made
her
plans
thank
you
she
said
she
made
a
sign
to
the
cabman
and
walked
on
through
the
doorway
into
a
little
garden
of
grass
with
a
few
flowers
on
each
side
against
the
walls
a
tiled
path
led
through
the
middle
of
the
grass
to
the
glass
door
of
the
house
sylvia
walked
straight
down
followed
by
the
cabman
who
brought
her
boxes
in
one
after
the
other
the
servant
giving
way
before
the
composure
of
this
strange
young
visitor
opened
the
door
of
a
upon
the
left
hand
and
sylvia
followed
by
her
trunks
entered
and
took
possession
what
name
shall
i
say
asked
the
servant
in
perplexity
she
had
had
no
orders
to
expect
a
visitor
sylvia
paid
the
cabman
and
waited
until
she
heard
the
garden
door
close
and
the
jingle
of
the
cab
as
it
was
driven
away
then
and
not
till
then
she
answered
the
question
no
name
just
please
tell
skinner
that
some
one
would
like
to
see
him
the
servant
stared
but
went
slowly
away
sylvia
seated
herself
firmly
upon
one
of
the
boxes
in
spite
of
her
composed
manner
her
heart
was
beating
wildly
she
heard
a
door
open
and
the
firm
tread
of
a
man
along
the
passage
sylvia
clung
to
her
box
after
all
she
was
in
the
house
she
and
her
baggage
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
man
who
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
tiny
room
came
in
and
stared
at
her
then
he
saw
her
boxes
and
he
frowned
in
perplexity
as
he
appeared
to
sylvia
he
was
a
man
of
about
with
a
handsome
aquiline
face
he
had
thick
dark
brown
hair
a
mustache
of
a
lighter
brown
and
eyes
of
the
color
of
hers
a
man
rather
lean
but
of
an
athletic
build
sylvia
watched
him
intently
but
the
only
look
upon
his
face
was
one
of
absolute
astonishment
he
saw
a
young
lady
quite
unknown
to
him
perched
upon
her
luggage
in
a
of
his
house
you
wanted
to
see
me
he
asked
yes
she
replied
getting
on
to
her
feet
she
looked
at
him
gravely
i
am
sylvia
she
said
a
smile
rather
like
her
own
smile
hesitated
about
his
mouth
and
who
is
sylvia
what
is
she
her
trunks
do
not
proclaim
her
he
said
beyond
that
sylvia
has
apparently
come
to
stay
i
am
rather
in
the
dark
you
are
garratt
skinner
yes
i
am
your
daughter
sylvia
my
daughter
sylvia
he
exclaimed
in
a
daze
then
he
sat
down
and
held
his
head
between
his
hands
yes
by
george
i
got
a
daughter
sylvia
he
said
obviously
recollecting
the
fact
with
surprise
but
you
are
at
chamonix
i
was
at
chamonix
yesterday
garratt
skinner
looked
sharply
at
sylvia
did
your
mother
send
you
to
me
no
she
answered
but
she
let
me
go
i
came
of
my
own
accord
a
letter
came
from
you
did
you
see
it
interrupted
her
father
did
she
show
it
you
no
but
she
gave
me
your
address
when
i
told
her
that
i
must
come
away
did
she
i
think
i
recognize
my
wife
in
that
kindly
act
he
said
with
a
sudden
bitterness
then
he
looked
curiously
at
his
daughter
why
did
you
want
to
come
away
i
was
unhappy
for
a
long
time
i
had
been
thinking
over
this
i
hated
it
all
the
people
we
met
the
hotels
we
stayed
at
the
life
altogether
then
at
chamonix
i
went
up
a
mountain
oho
said
her
father
sitting
up
alertly
so
you
went
up
a
mountain
which
one
the
aiguille
do
you
know
it
father
i
have
heard
of
it
said
garratt
skinner
well
somehow
that
made
a
difference
it
is
difficult
to
explain
but
i
felt
the
difference
i
felt
something
had
happened
to
me
which
i
had
to
recognize
a
new
thing
climbing
that
mountain
staying
for
an
hour
upon
its
summit
in
the
sunlight
with
all
those
great
still
pinnacles
and
about
me
it
was
just
like
hearing
very
beautiful
music
she
was
sitting
now
leaning
forward
with
her
hands
clasped
in
front
of
her
and
speaking
with
great
earnestness
all
the
vague
longings
which
had
ever
stirred
within
me
longings
for
something
beyond
and
beyond
came
back
upon
me
in
a
tumult
there
was
a
place
in
shadow
at
my
feet
far
below
the
only
place
in
shadow
a
wall
of
black
rock
called
the
col
dolent
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
living
in
that
cold
shadow
i
wanted
to
get
up
on
the
ridge
with
the
sunlight
so
i
came
to
you
it
seemed
to
sylvia
that
intently
as
she
spoke
her
words
were
and
must
be
elusive
to
another
unless
that
other
had
felt
what
she
felt
or
were
moved
by
sympathy
to
feel
it
her
father
listened
without
ridicule
without
a
smile
indeed
once
or
twice
he
nodded
his
head
to
her
words
was
it
comprehension
she
wondered
or
was
it
only
patience
when
i
came
down
from
that
summit
i
felt
that
what
i
had
hated
before
was
no
longer
endurable
at
all
so
i
came
to
you
her
father
got
up
from
his
chair
and
stood
for
a
little
while
looking
out
of
the
window
he
was
clearly
troubled
by
her
words
he
turned
away
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
but
but
what
can
i
do
for
you
here
he
cried
sylvia
i
am
a
very
poor
man
your
mother
on
the
other
hand
has
some
money
oh
father
i
sha
cost
you
much
she
replied
eagerly
i
might
perhaps
by
looking
after
things
save
you
money
i
wo
cost
you
much
garratt
skinner
looked
at
her
with
a
rueful
smile
you
look
to
me
rather
an
expensive
person
to
keep
up
he
said
mother
dressed
me
like
this
it
not
my
choice
she
said
i
let
her
do
as
she
wished
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
much
really
if
you
will
let
me
stay
you
will
find
me
useful
she
said
in
a
pathetic
appeal
useful
said
garratt
skinner
suddenly
he
again
took
stock
of
her
but
now
with
a
scrutiny
which
caused
her
a
vague
discomfort
he
seemed
to
be
appraising
her
from
the
color
of
her
hair
and
eyes
to
the
prettiness
of
her
feet
almost
as
though
she
was
for
sale
and
he
a
doubtful
purchaser
she
looked
down
on
the
carpet
and
slowly
her
blood
colored
her
neck
and
rose
into
her
face
useful
he
said
slowly
perhaps
so
yes
perhaps
so
and
upon
that
he
changed
his
tone
we
will
see
sylvia
you
must
stay
here
for
the
present
at
all
events
luckily
there
is
a
spare
room
i
have
some
friends
here
staying
to
supper
just
a
bachelor
friends
you
know
taking
without
any
ceremony
very
good
fellows
not
polished
perhaps
but
sound
of
heart
sylvia
my
girl
sound
of
heart
all
his
perplexity
had
vanished
he
had
taken
his
part
and
he
rattled
along
with
a
friendly
liveliness
which
cleared
the
shadows
from
thoughts
and
provoked
upon
her
face
her
rare
and
winning
smile
he
rang
the
bell
for
the
housemaid
my
daughter
will
stay
here
he
said
to
the
servant
astonishment
get
the
spare
room
ready
at
once
you
will
be
hostess
sylvia
and
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
i
become
a
family
man
well
well
he
took
sylvia
and
showed
her
a
little
bright
room
with
a
big
window
which
looked
out
across
the
garden
he
carried
her
boxes
up
himself
we
do
run
to
a
butler
he
said
got
everything
you
want
ring
if
you
have
we
have
supper
at
eight
and
we
sha
dress
only
well
you
could
look
dowdy
if
you
tried
sylvia
had
not
the
slightest
intention
to
try
she
put
on
a
little
frock
of
white
lace
high
at
the
throat
dressed
her
hair
and
then
having
a
little
time
to
spare
she
hurriedly
wrote
a
letter
this
letter
she
gave
to
the
servant
and
she
ran
you
will
be
careful
to
have
it
posted
please
she
said
and
at
that
moment
her
father
came
out
into
the
passage
so
quickly
that
he
might
have
been
listening
for
her
approach
she
stopped
upon
the
staircase
a
few
steps
above
him
the
evening
was
still
bright
and
the
daylight
fell
upon
her
from
a
window
above
the
hall
door
shall
i
do
she
asked
with
a
smile
the
staircase
was
paneled
with
a
dark
polished
wood
and
she
stood
out
from
that
somber
background
a
white
figure
delicate
and
dainty
and
wholesome
from
the
silver
buckle
on
her
satin
slipper
to
the
white
flower
she
had
placed
in
her
hair
her
face
with
its
remarkable
gentleness
its
suggestion
of
purity
as
of
one
unspotted
by
the
world
was
turned
to
him
with
a
confident
appeal
her
clear
gray
eyes
rested
quietly
on
his
yet
she
saw
his
face
change
it
seemed
that
a
spasm
of
pain
or
revolt
shook
him
upon
her
face
there
came
a
blank
look
why
was
he
displeased
but
the
spasm
passed
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
threw
off
his
doubt
you
are
very
pretty
he
said
sylvia
smile
just
showed
about
the
corners
of
her
lips
and
her
face
cleared
yes
she
said
with
satisfaction
garratt
skinner
laughed
oh
you
know
that
yes
she
replied
nodding
her
head
at
him
he
led
the
way
down
the
passage
toward
the
back
of
the
house
and
throwing
open
a
door
introduced
her
to
his
friends
captain
barstow
he
said
and
sylvia
found
herself
shaking
hands
with
a
little
man
with
a
shiny
bald
head
and
a
black
square
beard
he
had
an
screwed
into
his
right
eye
and
that
whole
side
of
his
face
was
distorted
by
the
contraction
of
the
muscles
and
drawn
upward
toward
the
eye
he
did
not
look
at
her
directly
but
with
an
oblique
and
furtive
glance
he
expressed
his
sense
of
the
honor
which
the
introduction
conferred
on
him
however
sylvia
was
determined
not
to
be
disappointed
she
turned
to
the
next
of
her
father
guests
archie
parminter
he
at
all
events
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
he
was
a
man
of
moderate
height
youthful
in
build
but
old
of
face
upon
which
there
sat
always
a
smirk
of
satisfaction
he
was
of
those
whom
no
beauty
in
others
no
grace
no
sweetness
could
greatly
impress
so
filled
was
he
with
he
had
no
time
to
admire
since
always
he
felt
that
he
was
being
admired
and
to
adjust
his
pose
and
to
speak
so
that
his
words
carried
to
the
right
distance
occupied
too
much
of
his
attention
he
seldom
spoke
to
the
person
he
talked
with
but
generally
to
some
other
a
woman
for
choice
whom
he
believed
to
be
listening
to
the
important
sentences
he
uttered
for
the
rest
he
had
grown
heavy
in
jaw
and
his
face
a
rather
flat
face
in
which
were
set
a
pair
of
sharp
dark
eyes
narrowed
in
toward
the
top
of
his
head
like
a
pear
he
bowed
suavely
to
sylvia
with
the
air
of
one
showing
to
the
room
how
a
gentleman
performed
that
ceremony
but
took
little
note
of
her
but
sylvia
was
determined
not
to
be
disappointed
her
father
took
her
by
the
elbow
and
turned
her
about
mr
hine
sylvia
was
confronted
with
a
youth
who
reddened
under
her
greeting
and
awkwardly
held
out
a
damp
coarse
hand
a
poor
creature
with
an
insipid
face
coarse
hair
and
manner
of
great
discomfort
he
was
as
tall
as
parminter
but
wore
his
good
clothes
with
sunday
air
and
having
been
introduced
to
sylvia
could
find
no
word
to
say
to
her
well
let
us
go
in
to
supper
said
her
father
and
he
held
open
the
door
for
her
to
pass
sylvia
went
into
the
across
the
narrow
hall
where
a
cold
supper
was
laid
upon
a
round
table
in
spite
of
her
resolve
to
see
all
things
in
a
rosy
light
she
grew
conscious
in
spite
of
herself
that
she
was
disappointed
in
her
father
friends
she
was
perplexed
too
he
was
so
clearly
head
and
shoulders
above
his
associates
that
she
wondered
at
their
presence
in
his
house
yet
he
seemed
quite
content
and
in
a
most
genial
mood
you
sit
here
sylvia
my
dear
he
said
pointing
to
a
chair
wallie
this
to
the
youth
hine
sit
beside
my
daughter
and
keep
her
amused
barstow
you
on
the
other
side
parminter
next
to
me
he
sat
opposite
sylvia
and
the
rest
took
their
places
hine
sidling
timidly
into
his
chair
and
tortured
by
the
thought
that
he
had
to
amuse
this
delicate
being
at
his
side
the
supper
is
on
the
table
said
garratt
skinner
parminter
will
you
cut
up
this
duck
hine
what
have
you
got
in
front
of
you
really
this
is
so
exceptional
an
occasion
that
i
think
he
started
up
suddenly
as
a
man
will
with
a
new
and
happy
idea
i
certainly
think
that
for
once
in
a
way
we
might
open
a
bottle
of
champagne
surprise
and
applause
greeted
this
brilliant
idea
and
hine
cried
out
i
think
champagne
fine
do
you
miss
skinner
he
collapsed
at
his
own
boldness
parminter
shrugged
his
shoulders
to
show
that
champagne
was
an
affair
with
him
it
drunk
a
good
deal
at
the
clubs
nowadays
he
said
meanwhile
garratt
skinner
had
not
moved
he
stood
looking
across
the
table
to
his
daughter
what
do
you
say
sylvia
it
an
extravagance
but
i
do
have
such
luck
every
day
it
in
your
honor
shall
we
yes
then
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
but
opened
the
door
of
a
cupboard
in
the
sideboard
and
there
quite
ready
stood
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
champagne
a
doubt
flashed
into
sylvia
mind
a
doubt
whether
her
father
brilliant
idea
was
really
the
inspiration
which
his
manner
had
suggested
those
bottles
looked
so
obviously
got
in
for
the
occasion
but
garratt
skinner
turned
to
her
apologetically
as
though
he
divined
her
thought
we
do
run
to
a
wine
cellar
sylvia
we
have
to
keep
what
little
stock
we
can
afford
in
here
her
doubt
vanished
but
in
an
instant
it
returned
again
for
as
her
father
came
round
the
table
with
the
bottle
in
his
hand
she
noticed
that
shallow
champagne
glasses
were
ready
laid
at
every
place
garratt
skinner
filled
the
glasses
and
returned
to
his
place
sylvia
he
said
and
smiling
he
drank
to
her
he
turned
to
his
companions
congratulate
me
then
he
sat
down
the
champagne
thawed
the
tongues
of
the
company
and
as
they
spoke
sylvia
heart
sank
more
and
more
for
in
word
and
thought
and
manner
her
father
guests
were
familiar
to
her
she
refused
to
acknowledge
it
but
the
knowledge
was
forced
upon
her
she
had
thought
to
step
out
of
a
world
which
she
hated
against
which
her
delicacy
and
her
purity
revolted
and
lo
she
had
stepped
out
merely
to
take
a
stride
and
step
down
into
it
again
at
another
place
the
obsequious
attentiveness
of
captain
barstow
the
vanity
of
parminter
and
his
affected
voice
suggesting
that
he
came
out
of
the
great
world
to
this
little
supper
party
really
without
any
sense
of
condescension
at
all
and
the
behavior
of
walter
hine
who
to
give
himself
courage
gulped
down
his
champagne
it
was
all
horribly
familiar
her
one
consolation
was
her
father
he
sat
opposite
to
her
his
strong
aquiline
face
a
fine
contrast
to
the
faces
of
the
others
he
had
an
ease
of
manner
which
they
did
not
possess
he
talked
with
a
quietude
of
his
own
and
he
had
a
watchful
eye
and
a
ready
smile
for
his
daughter
indeed
it
seemed
that
what
she
felt
his
guests
felt
too
for
they
spoke
to
him
with
a
certain
deference
almost
as
if
they
spoke
to
their
master
he
alone
apparently
noticed
no
unsuitability
in
his
guests
he
sat
at
his
ease
their
bosom
friend
meanwhile
plied
with
champagne
by
archie
parminter
who
sat
upon
the
other
side
of
him
wallie
hine
began
to
boast
sylvia
tried
to
check
him
but
he
was
not
now
to
be
stopped
his
very
timidity
pricked
him
on
to
extravagance
and
his
boasting
was
that
worst
form
of
boasting
the
vaunt
of
the
innocent
weakling
anxious
to
figure
as
a
conqueror
of
women
with
a
flushed
face
he
dropped
his
foolish
hints
of
mrs
this
and
lady
that
with
an
eye
upon
sylvia
to
watch
the
impression
which
he
made
and
a
wise
air
which
said
if
only
i
were
to
tell
you
all
garratt
skinner
opened
a
fresh
bottle
of
champagne
the
supply
by
now
was
getting
low
and
came
round
the
table
with
it
as
he
held
the
neck
of
the
bottle
to
the
brim
of
hine
glass
he
caught
an
appealing
look
from
his
daughter
at
once
he
lifted
the
bottle
and
left
the
glass
unfilled
as
he
passed
sylvia
she
said
in
a
low
voice
thank
you
and
he
whispered
back
you
are
quite
right
my
dear
interest
him
so
that
he
does
notice
that
i
have
left
his
glass
empty
sylvia
set
herself
then
to
talk
to
wallie
hine
but
he
was
intent
on
making
her
understand
what
great
successes
had
been
his
he
talk
and
it
troubled
her
that
all
listened
and
listened
with
an
air
of
admiration
even
her
father
from
his
side
of
the
table
smiled
indulgently
yet
the
stories
or
rather
the
hints
of
stories
were
certainly
untrue
for
this
her
wanderings
had
taught
her
the
man
of
many
successes
never
talks
it
seemed
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
flatter
the
wretched
youth
yes
yes
you
have
been
a
devil
of
a
fellow
among
the
women
wallie
said
captain
barstow
but
at
once
garratt
skinner
interfered
and
sharply
come
come
barstow
that
no
language
to
use
before
my
daughter
captain
barstow
presented
at
the
moment
a
remarkable
gradation
of
color
on
the
top
was
the
bald
head
very
shiny
and
white
below
that
a
face
now
everywhere
a
deep
red
except
where
the
swollen
veins
stood
out
upon
the
surface
of
his
cheeks
and
those
were
purple
and
this
in
its
turn
was
enclosed
by
the
black
square
beard
he
bowed
at
once
to
garratt
skinner
rebuke
i
apologize
i
do
indeed
miss
sylvia
but
when
i
was
in
the
service
we
still
clung
to
the
traditions
of
wellington
by
by
george
and
it
hard
to
break
oneself
of
the
habit
he
said
with
a
chuckle
that
what
they
called
me
in
the
regiment
barstow
i
bet
that
barstow
is
still
pretty
well
remembered
among
the
boys
at
cheltenham
swearing
bad
form
nowadays
said
archie
parminter
superciliously
they
have
given
it
up
at
the
clubs
sylvia
seized
the
moment
and
rose
from
the
table
her
father
sprang
forward
and
opened
the
door
we
will
join
you
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
sylvia
went
down
the
passage
to
the
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
in
which
she
had
been
presented
by
her
father
to
his
friends
she
rang
the
bell
at
once
and
when
the
servant
came
she
said
i
gave
you
a
letter
to
post
this
evening
i
should
like
to
have
it
back
i
am
sorry
miss
but
it
posted
i
am
sorry
too
said
sylvia
quietly
the
letter
had
been
written
to
chayne
and
gave
him
the
address
of
this
house
as
the
place
where
he
might
find
her
if
he
called
she
had
no
thought
of
going
away
she
had
made
her
choice
for
good
or
ill
and
must
abide
by
it
that
she
knew
but
she
was
no
longer
sure
that
she
wished
captain
chayne
to
come
and
find
her
there
chapter
x
a
little
round
game
of
cards
sylvia
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
waited
she
waited
impatiently
for
she
knew
that
she
had
almost
reached
the
limits
of
her
and
needed
the
presence
of
others
to
keep
her
from
breaking
down
but
her
native
courage
came
to
her
aid
and
in
half
an
hour
she
heard
the
steps
of
her
father
and
his
guests
in
the
passage
she
noticed
that
her
father
looked
anxiously
toward
her
as
he
came
in
do
you
mind
if
we
bring
in
our
cigars
he
asked
not
at
all
said
she
and
he
came
in
carrying
in
his
hand
a
box
of
cigars
which
he
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
table
wallie
hine
at
once
stumbled
across
the
room
to
sylvia
he
walked
unsteadily
his
features
were
more
flushed
than
before
she
shrank
a
little
from
him
but
he
had
not
the
time
to
sit
down
beside
her
for
captain
barstow
exclaimed
jovially
i
say
garratt
i
have
an
idea
there
are
five
of
us
here
let
us
have
a
little
round
game
of
cards
sylvia
started
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
just
some
such
proposal
as
this
she
had
been
dreading
all
the
evening
her
sinking
hopes
died
away
altogether
this
poor
witless
youth
plied
with
champagne
the
older
men
who
flattered
him
with
lies
the
suggestion
of
champagne
made
as
though
it
were
a
sudden
inspiration
and
the
six
bottles
standing
ready
in
the
cupboard
and
now
the
suggestion
of
a
little
round
game
of
cards
made
in
just
the
same
tone
sylvia
had
a
feeling
of
horror
she
had
kept
herself
unspotted
from
her
world
but
not
through
ignorance
she
knew
it
she
knew
those
little
round
games
of
cards
and
what
came
of
them
sometimes
merely
misery
and
ruin
sometimes
a
pistol
shot
in
the
early
morning
she
turned
very
pale
but
she
managed
to
say
thank
you
i
do
play
cards
and
then
she
heard
a
sudden
movement
by
her
father
who
at
the
moment
when
barstow
spoke
had
been
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
she
looked
up
garratt
skinner
was
staring
in
astonishment
at
captain
barstow
cards
he
cried
in
my
house
on
a
sunday
evening
with
each
question
his
amazement
grew
and
he
ended
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
come
barstow
you
know
me
too
well
to
propose
that
i
am
rather
hurt
a
friendly
talk
and
a
smoke
yes
perhaps
a
small
whisky
and
soda
i
say
no
but
cards
on
a
sunday
evening
no
indeed
oh
i
say
skinner
objected
wallie
hine
there
no
harm
in
a
little
game
garratt
skinner
shook
his
head
at
hine
in
a
grave
friendly
way
better
leave
cards
alone
wallie
always
you
are
young
you
know
hine
flushed
i
am
old
enough
to
hold
my
own
against
any
man
he
cried
hotly
he
felt
that
garratt
skinner
had
humiliated
him
and
before
this
wonderful
daughter
of
his
in
whose
good
favors
hine
had
been
making
such
inroads
during
supper
barstow
apologized
for
his
suggestion
at
once
but
hine
was
now
quite
unwilling
that
he
should
withdraw
it
there
no
harm
in
it
he
cried
i
really
think
you
are
too
puritanical
is
he
miss
miss
sylvia
hine
had
been
endeavoring
to
pluck
up
courage
to
use
her
christian
name
all
the
evening
his
pride
that
he
had
actually
spoken
it
was
so
great
that
he
did
not
remark
at
all
her
little
movement
of
disgust
garratt
skinner
seemed
to
weaken
in
his
resolution
well
of
course
wallie
he
said
i
want
you
to
enjoy
yourselves
and
if
you
especially
want
it
did
he
notice
that
sylvia
closed
her
eyes
and
really
shivered
she
could
not
tell
but
he
suddenly
spoke
in
a
tone
of
revolt
but
on
sunday
really
no
it
done
nowadays
at
the
clubs
said
archie
parminter
oh
is
it
said
garratt
skinner
again
grown
doubtful
is
it
indeed
well
if
they
do
it
in
the
clubs
and
then
with
an
exclamation
of
relief
i
have
got
a
pack
of
cards
in
the
house
that
settles
the
point
there
a
public
house
almost
next
door
replied
barstow
if
you
send
out
your
servant
i
am
sure
she
could
borrow
one
no
said
garratt
skinner
indignantly
really
barstow
your
bachelor
habits
have
had
a
bad
effect
on
you
i
would
not
think
of
sending
a
girl
out
to
a
public
house
on
any
consideration
it
might
be
the
very
first
step
downhill
for
her
and
i
should
be
responsible
oh
well
if
you
are
so
particular
i
go
myself
cried
barstow
petulantly
he
got
up
and
walked
to
the
door
i
do
mind
so
much
if
you
go
yourself
only
please
do
say
you
come
from
this
house
said
garratt
skinner
and
barstow
went
out
from
the
room
he
came
back
in
a
very
short
time
and
sylvia
noticed
at
once
that
he
held
two
quite
new
and
unopened
packs
of
cards
in
his
hand
a
stroke
of
luck
he
cried
the
landlord
had
a
couple
of
new
packs
for
he
was
expecting
to
give
a
little
party
but
a
relation
of
his
wife
died
rather
suddenly
yesterday
and
he
put
his
guests
off
a
fellow
i
think
what
yes
it
not
every
one
who
would
have
shown
so
much
good
feeling
said
garratt
skinner
seriously
one
likes
to
know
that
there
are
men
about
like
that
one
feels
kindlier
to
the
whole
world
and
he
drew
up
his
chair
to
the
table
sylvia
was
puzzled
was
this
story
of
the
landlord
a
glib
lie
of
captain
barstow
to
account
with
a
detail
which
should
carry
conviction
for
the
suspiciously
new
pack
of
cards
and
if
so
did
her
father
believe
in
its
truth
had
the
packs
been
waiting
in
captain
barstow
coat
pocket
in
the
hall
until
the
fitting
moment
for
their
appearance
if
so
did
her
father
play
a
part
in
the
conspiracy
his
face
gave
no
sign
she
was
terribly
troubled
penny
points
said
garratt
skinner
nothing
more
oh
come
i
say
cried
hine
as
he
pulled
out
a
handful
of
sovereigns
nothing
more
than
penny
points
in
my
house
put
that
money
away
wallie
we
will
use
counters
garratt
skinner
had
a
box
of
counters
if
he
had
no
pack
of
cards
penny
points
a
sixpenny
ante
and
a
shilling
limit
he
said
then
no
harm
will
be
done
to
any
one
the
black
counters
a
shilling
the
red
sixpence
and
the
white
ones
a
penny
you
have
each
a
pound
worth
he
said
as
he
dealt
them
out
sylvia
rose
from
her
chair
i
think
i
will
go
to
bed
wallie
hine
turned
round
in
his
chair
holding
his
counters
in
his
hand
oh
do
do
that
miss
sylvia
sit
beside
me
please
and
bring
me
luck
you
forget
wallie
that
my
daughter
has
just
come
from
a
long
journey
no
doubt
she
is
tired
said
garratt
skinner
with
a
friendly
reproach
in
his
voice
he
got
up
and
opened
the
door
for
his
daughter
after
she
had
passed
out
he
followed
her
i
shall
take
a
hand
for
a
little
while
sylvia
to
see
that
they
keep
to
the
stakes
i
think
young
hine
wants
looking
after
do
you
he
know
any
geography
my
dear
sleep
well
he
took
her
by
the
elbow
and
drew
her
toward
him
he
stooped
to
her
meaning
to
kiss
her
sylvia
did
not
resist
but
she
drooped
her
head
so
that
her
forehead
not
her
lips
was
presented
to
his
embrace
and
the
kiss
was
never
given
she
remained
standing
her
face
lowered
from
his
her
attitude
one
of
resignation
and
despondency
she
felt
her
hand
shake
upon
her
arm
and
looking
up
saw
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
in
pity
he
dropped
her
arm
quickly
and
said
in
a
sharp
voice
there
go
to
bed
child
he
watched
her
as
she
went
up
the
stairs
she
went
up
slowly
and
without
turning
round
and
she
walked
like
one
utterly
tired
out
garratt
skinner
waited
until
he
heard
her
door
close
she
should
never
have
come
he
said
she
should
never
have
come
then
he
went
slowly
back
to
his
friends
sylvia
went
to
bed
but
she
did
not
sleep
the
excitement
which
had
buoyed
her
up
had
passed
and
her
hopes
had
passed
with
it
she
recalled
the
high
anticipations
with
which
she
had
set
out
from
chamonix
only
yesterday
yes
only
yesterday
and
against
them
in
a
vivid
contrast
she
set
the
actual
reality
the
supper
party
barstow
archie
parminter
and
the
poor
witless
wallie
hine
with
his
twang
and
his
silly
boasts
she
began
to
wonder
whether
there
was
any
other
world
than
that
which
she
knew
any
other
people
than
those
with
whom
she
had
lived
her
father
was
different
yes
but
but
her
father
was
too
perplexing
a
problem
to
her
at
this
moment
why
had
he
so
clearly
pitied
her
just
now
in
the
passage
why
had
he
checked
himself
from
the
kiss
she
was
too
tired
to
reason
it
out
she
was
conscious
that
she
was
very
wretched
and
the
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
in
the
darkness
of
her
room
she
cried
silently
pressing
the
sheet
to
her
lips
lest
a
sob
should
be
heard
were
all
her
dreams
mere
empty
imaginings
she
asked
if
so
why
should
they
ever
have
come
to
her
she
inquired
piteously
why
should
she
have
found
solace
in
them
why
should
they
have
become
her
real
life
did
no
one
walk
the
earth
of
all
that
company
which
went
with
her
in
her
fancies
upon
that
her
thoughts
flew
to
the
alps
to
the
evening
in
the
pavillon
de
lognan
the
climb
upon
the
rocks
and
the
glittering
the
perfect
hour
upon
the
sunlit
top
of
the
aiguille
the
memory
of
the
mountains
brought
her
consolation
in
her
bad
hour
as
her
friend
had
prophesied
it
would
her
tears
ceased
to
flow
she
lived
that
day
her
one
day
over
again
jealous
of
every
minute
after
all
that
had
been
real
and
more
perfect
than
any
dream
moreover
there
had
been
with
her
through
the
day
a
man
honest
and
loyal
as
any
of
her
imagined
company
she
began
to
take
heart
a
little
she
thought
of
the
col
dolent
with
its
broad
ribbon
of
ice
set
in
the
sheer
black
rocks
and
always
in
shadow
she
thought
of
herself
as
going
up
some
such
hard
cold
road
in
the
shadow
and
remembered
that
on
the
top
of
the
col
one
came
out
into
sunlight
and
looked
southward
into
italy
so
comforted
a
little
she
fell
asleep
it
was
some
hours
before
she
woke
it
was
already
day
and
since
she
had
raised
her
blinds
before
she
had
got
into
bed
the
light
streamed
into
the
room
she
thought
for
a
moment
that
it
was
the
light
which
had
waked
her
but
as
she
lay
she
heard
a
murmur
of
voices
very
low
and
a
sound
of
people
moving
stealthily
she
looked
out
of
the
window
the
streets
were
quite
empty
and
silent
in
the
houses
on
the
opposite
side
the
blinds
were
drawn
a
gray
clear
light
was
spread
over
the
town
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
she
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
five
she
listened
again
gently
opening
her
door
for
an
inch
or
so
she
heard
the
low
voices
more
clearly
now
those
who
spoke
were
speaking
almost
in
whispers
she
thought
that
thieves
had
broken
in
she
hurried
on
a
few
clothes
cautiously
opened
her
door
wider
slipped
through
and
crept
with
a
beating
heart
down
the
stairs
half
way
down
the
stairs
she
looked
over
the
rail
of
the
banister
turning
her
head
toward
the
back
part
of
the
house
whence
the
murmurs
came
at
the
end
of
the
passage
was
the
little
room
in
which
the
round
game
of
cards
was
played
the
night
before
the
door
stood
open
now
and
she
looked
right
into
the
room
and
this
is
what
she
saw
wallie
hine
was
sitting
at
the
table
about
him
the
carpet
was
strewn
with
crumpled
pieces
of
paper
there
was
quite
a
number
of
them
littered
around
his
chair
he
was
writing
or
rather
trying
to
write
for
archie
parminter
leaning
over
the
back
of
the
chair
held
his
hand
and
guided
it
captain
barstow
stood
looking
intently
on
but
of
her
father
there
was
no
sign
she
could
not
see
the
whole
room
however
a
good
section
of
it
was
concealed
from
her
wallie
hine
was
leaning
forward
on
the
table
with
his
head
so
low
and
his
arms
so
spread
that
she
could
not
see
in
what
book
he
was
writing
but
apparently
he
did
not
write
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
companions
in
spite
of
parminter
care
his
pen
spluttered
sylvia
saw
archie
look
at
barstow
and
she
heard
barstow
answer
no
that
wo
do
archie
parminter
dropped
hine
hand
tore
a
slip
of
paper
out
of
the
book
crumpled
it
and
threw
it
down
with
a
gesture
of
anger
on
to
the
carpet
try
again
old
fellow
said
barstow
eagerly
bending
down
toward
hine
with
a
horrid
smile
upon
his
face
a
smile
which
tried
to
conceal
an
intense
exasperation
an
intense
desire
to
strike
again
parminter
leaned
over
the
chair
again
he
took
wallie
hine
hand
and
guided
the
pen
very
carefully
lifting
it
from
the
paper
at
the
end
of
an
initial
or
a
word
and
spacing
the
letters
this
time
he
seemed
content
that
will
do
i
think
he
said
in
a
whisper
captain
barstow
bent
down
and
examined
the
writing
carefully
with
his
eyes
yes
that
all
right
parminter
tore
the
leaf
out
but
this
time
he
did
not
crumple
it
he
blotted
it
carefully
folded
it
and
laid
it
on
the
let
us
get
him
up
he
said
and
with
barstow
help
they
lifted
hine
out
of
his
chair
sylvia
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
face
his
mouth
was
loose
his
eyes
half
shut
and
the
lids
red
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
stupor
his
head
rolled
upon
his
shoulders
he
swayed
as
his
companions
held
him
up
his
knees
gave
under
him
he
began
incoherently
to
talk
hush
said
parminter
you
wake
the
house
you
do
want
that
pretty
girl
to
see
you
in
this
state
do
you
wallie
after
the
impression
you
made
on
her
too
get
his
hat
and
coat
out
of
the
passage
barstow
he
propped
hine
against
the
table
and
holding
him
upright
turned
to
the
door
he
saw
the
pretty
girl
leaning
over
the
banister
and
gazing
with
eyes
into
the
room
sylvia
drew
back
on
the
instant
with
a
gesture
of
his
hand
archie
parminter
stopped
barstow
on
his
way
to
the
door
sylvia
leaned
back
against
the
wall
of
the
staircase
holding
her
breath
and
tightly
pressing
a
hand
upon
her
heart
had
they
seen
her
would
they
come
out
into
the
passage
what
would
happen
would
they
kill
her
the
questions
raced
through
her
mind
she
could
not
have
moved
she
thought
had
death
stood
over
her
but
nothing
happened
she
could
not
now
see
into
the
room
and
she
heard
no
whisper
no
footsteps
creeping
stealthily
along
the
passage
toward
her
no
sound
at
all
presently
she
recovered
her
breath
and
crept
once
in
her
room
with
great
care
she
locked
the
door
and
sank
upon
her
bed
shaking
and
trembling
there
she
lay
until
the
noise
of
the
hall
door
closing
very
gently
roused
her
she
crept
along
the
wall
till
she
was
by
the
side
of
the
window
then
she
raised
herself
against
the
wall
and
peered
out
she
saw
barstow
and
parminter
supporting
hine
along
the
street
each
with
an
arm
through
his
a
drove
up
they
lifted
hine
into
it
got
in
themselves
and
drove
off
as
the
cab
turned
archie
parminter
glanced
up
to
the
windows
of
the
house
but
sylvia
was
behind
the
curtains
at
the
side
he
could
not
have
seen
her
sylvia
leaned
her
head
against
the
panels
of
the
door
and
concentrated
all
her
powers
so
that
not
a
movement
in
the
house
might
escape
her
ears
she
listened
for
the
sound
of
some
one
else
moving
in
the
room
below
some
one
who
had
been
left
behind
she
listened
for
a
creak
of
the
stairs
the
brushing
of
a
coat
against
the
stair
rail
the
sound
of
some
one
going
stealthily
to
his
room
she
stood
at
the
door
with
her
face
strangely
set
for
a
long
while
her
mind
was
quite
made
up
if
she
heard
her
father
moving
from
that
room
she
would
just
wait
until
he
was
asleep
and
then
she
would
go
anywhere
she
could
not
go
back
to
her
mother
that
she
knew
she
had
no
one
to
go
to
nevertheless
she
would
go
but
no
sound
reached
her
her
father
was
not
in
the
room
below
he
must
have
gone
to
bed
and
left
the
others
to
themselves
the
pigeon
had
been
plucked
that
night
not
a
doubt
of
it
but
her
father
had
had
no
hand
in
the
plucking
she
laid
herself
down
upon
her
bed
exhausted
and
again
sleep
came
to
her
and
in
a
moment
the
sound
of
running
water
was
in
her
ears
chapter
xi
sylvia
father
makes
a
mistake
sylvia
did
not
wake
again
until
the
maid
brought
in
her
tea
and
told
her
that
it
was
eight
when
she
went
her
father
was
already
in
the
she
scanned
him
closely
but
his
face
bore
no
sign
whatever
of
a
late
and
tempestuous
night
and
a
great
relief
enheartened
her
he
met
her
with
an
open
smile
did
you
sleep
well
sylvia
not
very
well
father
she
answered
as
she
watched
his
face
i
woke
up
in
the
early
morning
but
nothing
could
have
been
more
easy
or
natural
than
his
comment
on
her
words
yet
you
look
like
a
good
sleeper
a
strange
house
i
suppose
sylvia
voices
in
the
strange
house
she
answered
voices
garratt
skinner
face
darkened
did
those
fellows
stay
so
late
he
asked
with
annoyance
what
time
was
it
when
they
woke
you
up
sylvia
a
little
before
five
garratt
skinner
annoyance
increased
that
too
bad
he
cried
i
left
them
and
went
to
bed
but
they
promised
me
faithfully
only
to
stay
another
i
am
very
sorry
sylvia
and
as
she
poured
out
the
tea
he
continued
i
will
speak
pretty
sharply
to
barstow
it
altogether
too
bad
garratt
skinner
breakfasted
with
an
eye
on
the
clock
and
as
soon
as
the
hands
pointed
to
five
minutes
to
nine
he
rose
from
the
table
i
must
be
off
business
my
dear
he
came
round
the
table
to
her
and
gently
laid
a
hand
upon
her
shoulder
it
makes
a
great
difference
sylvia
to
have
a
daughter
fresh
and
young
and
pretty
sitting
opposite
to
me
at
the
breakfast
table
a
very
great
difference
i
shall
cut
work
early
on
account
of
it
i
come
home
and
fetch
you
and
we
go
out
and
lunch
somewhere
together
he
spoke
with
every
sign
of
genuine
feeling
and
sylvia
looking
up
into
his
face
was
moved
by
what
he
said
he
smiled
down
at
her
with
her
own
winning
smile
he
looked
her
in
the
face
with
her
own
frankness
her
own
good
humor
i
have
been
a
lonely
man
for
a
good
many
years
sylvia
he
said
too
lonely
i
am
glad
the
years
have
come
to
an
end
and
this
time
he
did
what
yesterday
night
he
had
checked
himself
from
doing
he
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
then
he
went
from
the
room
took
his
hat
and
letting
himself
out
of
the
house
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
called
a
passing
cab
and
as
he
entered
it
he
said
to
the
driver
go
to
the
london
and
county
bank
in
victoria
street
and
gaily
waving
his
hand
to
his
daughter
who
stood
behind
the
window
he
drove
off
at
one
he
returned
in
the
same
high
spirits
sylvia
had
spent
the
morning
in
removing
the
superfluous
cherries
and
roses
from
her
best
hat
and
making
her
frock
at
once
more
simple
and
more
suitable
to
her
years
garratt
skinner
surveyed
her
with
pride
come
on
he
said
i
have
kept
the
cab
waiting
for
a
poor
man
he
seemed
to
sylvia
rather
reckless
they
drove
to
the
savoy
hotel
and
lunched
together
in
the
open
air
underneath
the
glass
roof
with
a
bank
of
flowers
upon
one
side
of
them
and
the
windows
of
the
on
the
other
the
day
was
very
hot
the
streets
baked
in
an
arid
glare
of
sunlight
a
dry
dust
from
the
wood
pavement
powdered
those
who
passed
by
in
the
strand
here
however
in
this
cool
and
shaded
place
the
pair
lunched
happily
together
garratt
skinner
had
the
tact
not
to
ask
any
questions
of
his
daughter
about
her
mother
or
how
they
had
fared
together
he
talked
easily
of
unimportant
things
and
pointed
out
from
time
to
time
some
person
of
note
or
some
fashionable
actress
who
happened
to
pass
in
or
out
of
the
hotel
he
could
be
good
company
when
he
chose
and
he
chose
on
this
morning
it
was
not
until
coffee
was
set
before
them
and
he
had
lighted
a
cigar
that
he
touched
upon
themselves
and
then
not
with
any
paternal
tone
but
rather
as
one
comrade
conferring
with
another
there
indeed
was
his
great
advantage
with
sylvia
her
mother
had
either
disregarded
her
or
treated
her
as
a
child
she
could
not
but
be
won
by
a
father
who
laid
bare
his
plans
to
her
and
asked
for
her
criticism
as
well
as
her
assent
her
suspicions
of
yesterday
died
away
or
at
all
events
slept
so
soundly
that
they
could
not
have
troubled
her
less
had
they
been
dead
sylvia
he
said
i
think
london
in
august
and
in
such
an
august
is
too
hot
i
do
want
to
see
you
grow
pale
and
for
myself
i
have
had
a
holiday
for
a
long
time
you
see
there
is
not
much
temptation
for
a
lonely
man
to
go
away
by
himself
for
the
second
time
that
day
he
appealed
to
her
on
the
ground
of
his
loneliness
and
not
in
vain
she
began
even
to
feel
remorseful
that
she
had
left
him
to
his
loneliness
so
long
there
rose
up
within
her
an
almost
maternal
feeling
of
pity
for
her
father
she
did
not
stop
to
think
that
he
had
never
sent
for
her
had
never
indeed
shown
a
particle
of
interest
in
her
until
they
had
met
face
to
face
but
since
you
are
here
he
continued
well
i
have
been
doing
fairly
well
in
my
business
lately
and
i
thought
we
might
take
a
little
holiday
together
at
some
quiet
village
by
the
sea
you
know
nothing
of
england
i
have
been
thinking
it
all
out
this
morning
there
is
no
country
more
beautiful
or
more
typical
than
dorsetshire
besides
you
were
born
there
what
do
you
say
to
three
weeks
or
so
in
dorsetshire
we
will
stay
at
an
hotel
in
weymouth
for
a
few
days
and
look
about
for
a
house
father
exclaimed
sylvia
leaning
forward
with
shining
eyes
it
will
be
splendid
just
you
and
i
well
not
quite
he
answered
slowly
and
as
he
saw
his
daughter
sink
back
with
a
pucker
of
disappointment
on
her
forehead
he
knocked
the
ash
off
his
cigar
and
in
his
turn
leaned
forward
over
the
table
sylvia
i
want
to
talk
to
you
seriously
he
said
and
glanced
around
to
make
sure
that
no
one
overheard
him
i
should
very
much
like
one
person
to
come
and
stay
with
us
sylvia
made
no
answer
her
face
was
grave
and
very
still
her
eyes
dwelt
quietly
upon
him
and
betrayed
nothing
of
what
she
thought
you
have
guessed
who
the
one
person
is
again
sylvia
did
not
answer
yes
it
is
wallie
hine
he
continued
her
suspicions
were
stirring
again
from
their
sleep
she
waited
in
fear
upon
his
words
she
looked
out
through
the
opening
at
the
mouth
of
the
court
into
the
glare
of
the
strand
the
bright
prospect
which
her
vivid
fancies
had
pictured
there
a
minute
since
transforming
the
dusky
street
into
fields
of
corn
and
purple
heather
the
omnibuses
into
wagons
drawn
by
teams
of
great
horses
musical
with
bells
had
all
grown
dark
a
real
horror
was
gripping
her
but
she
turned
her
eyes
quietly
back
upon
her
father
face
and
waited
his
presence
will
spoil
our
holiday
a
little
garratt
skinner
continued
with
an
easy
assurance
you
saw
no
doubt
what
wallie
hine
is
last
night
a
weak
foolish
youth
barely
awkward
with
graces
of
neither
mind
nor
body
and
in
the
hands
of
two
scoundrels
sylvia
started
and
she
leaned
forward
with
a
look
of
bewilderment
plain
to
see
in
her
dark
eyes
yes
that
the
truth
sylvia
he
has
come
into
a
little
money
and
he
is
in
the
hands
of
two
scoundrels
who
are
leading
him
by
the
nose
my
poor
girl
he
cried
suddenly
breaking
off
you
must
have
found
yourself
in
very
strange
and
disappointing
company
last
night
i
was
very
sorry
for
you
and
sorry
for
myself
too
all
the
evening
i
was
saying
to
myself
wonder
what
my
little
girl
is
thinking
of
me
but
i
help
it
i
had
not
the
time
to
explain
i
had
to
sit
quiet
knowing
that
you
must
be
unhappy
certain
that
you
must
be
despising
me
for
the
company
i
kept
sylvia
blushed
guiltily
despising
you
no
father
she
said
in
a
voice
of
apology
i
saw
how
much
above
the
rest
you
were
blaming
me
then
interrupted
garratt
skinner
with
an
easy
smile
he
was
not
at
all
offended
let
us
say
blaming
me
and
it
was
quite
natural
that
you
should
judging
by
the
surface
and
there
was
nothing
but
the
surface
for
you
to
judge
by
while
in
this
way
defending
sylvia
against
her
own
he
only
succeeded
in
making
her
feel
still
more
that
she
had
judged
hastily
where
she
should
have
held
all
judgment
in
abeyance
that
she
had
lacked
faith
where
by
right
she
should
have
shown
most
faith
but
he
wished
to
spare
her
from
confusion
i
was
so
proud
of
you
that
i
could
not
but
suffer
all
the
more
however
do
let
us
talk
of
it
my
dear
and
waving
with
a
gesture
of
the
hand
that
little
misunderstanding
away
forever
he
resumed
well
i
am
rather
fond
of
wallie
hine
i
do
know
why
perhaps
because
he
is
so
helpless
because
he
so
much
stands
in
need
of
a
steady
mentor
at
his
elbow
there
is
after
all
no
accounting
for
one
likings
logic
and
reason
have
little
to
do
with
them
as
a
woman
you
know
that
and
being
rather
fond
of
wallie
hine
i
have
tried
to
do
my
best
for
him
it
would
not
have
been
of
any
use
to
shut
my
door
on
barstow
and
archie
parminter
they
have
much
too
firm
a
hold
on
the
poor
youth
i
should
have
been
shutting
it
on
wallie
hine
too
no
the
only
plan
was
to
welcome
them
all
to
play
parminter
game
of
showing
the
youth
about
town
and
barstow
game
of
crude
flattery
and
gradually
if
possible
to
dissociate
him
from
his
companions
before
they
had
fleeced
him
altogether
so
you
were
let
in
my
dear
for
that
unfortunate
evening
of
course
i
was
quite
sure
that
you
would
not
attribute
to
me
designs
upon
wallie
hine
otherwise
i
should
have
turned
them
all
out
at
once
he
spoke
with
a
laugh
putting
aside
as
it
were
a
quite
incredible
suggestion
but
he
looked
at
her
sharply
as
he
laughed
sylvia
face
grew
crimson
her
eyes
for
once
wavered
from
his
face
and
she
lowered
her
head
garratt
skinner
however
seemed
not
to
notice
her
confusion
you
remember
he
continued
that
i
tried
to
stop
them
playing
cards
at
the
beginning
i
yielded
in
the
end
because
it
became
perfectly
clear
that
if
i
did
they
would
go
away
and
play
elsewhere
while
i
at
all
events
could
keep
the
points
down
in
my
own
house
i
ought
to
have
stayed
up
i
suppose
until
they
went
away
i
blame
myself
there
a
little
but
i
had
no
idea
they
would
stay
so
late
are
you
sure
it
was
their
voices
you
heard
and
not
the
servants
moving
he
asked
the
question
almost
carelessly
but
his
eyes
rather
belied
his
tone
for
they
watched
her
intently
quite
sure
she
answered
you
might
have
made
a
mistake
no
for
i
saw
them
garratt
skinner
covered
his
mouth
with
his
hand
it
seemed
to
sylvia
that
he
smiled
a
suspicion
flashed
across
her
mind
in
spite
of
herself
was
he
merely
testing
her
to
see
whether
she
would
speak
the
truth
or
not
did
he
know
that
she
had
come
down
the
stairs
in
the
early
morning
she
thrust
the
suspicion
aside
remembering
the
which
suspicion
had
already
caused
her
at
this
very
luncheon
table
if
it
were
true
that
her
father
knew
why
then
barstow
or
parminter
must
have
told
him
this
very
morning
and
if
he
had
seen
either
of
them
this
morning
all
his
talk
to
her
in
this
cool
and
quiet
place
was
a
carefully
prepared
hypocrisy
no
she
would
not
believe
that
you
saw
them
he
exclaimed
tell
me
how
she
told
him
the
whole
story
how
she
had
come
down
the
staircase
what
she
had
seen
as
she
leaned
over
the
balustrade
and
how
parminter
had
turned
do
you
think
he
saw
you
asked
her
father
sylvia
looked
at
him
closely
but
he
seemed
really
anxious
to
know
i
think
he
saw
something
she
answered
whether
he
knew
that
it
was
i
whom
he
saw
i
ca
tell
garratt
skinner
sat
for
a
little
while
smoking
his
cigar
in
short
angry
puffs
i
would
have
had
that
happen
for
worlds
he
said
with
a
frown
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
slips
of
paper
on
which
poor
hine
was
trying
to
write
were
heaven
knows
what
he
lost
last
night
i
know
returned
sylvia
he
lost
last
night
impossible
cried
garratt
skinner
with
so
much
violence
that
the
people
lunching
at
the
tables
looked
up
at
the
couple
with
surprise
oh
no
i
not
believe
it
sylvia
and
as
he
lowered
his
voice
he
seemed
to
be
making
an
appeal
to
her
to
go
back
upon
her
words
so
distressed
was
he
at
the
thought
that
wallie
hine
should
be
jockeyed
out
of
so
much
money
at
his
house
four
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
sylvia
repeated
garratt
skinner
caught
at
a
comforting
thought
well
it
only
in
that
one
thing
i
can
stop
the
redemption
of
them
you
see
he
has
been
robbed
that
the
plain
english
of
it
robbed
hine
was
not
writing
an
he
was
writing
a
check
and
parminter
was
guiding
his
hand
as
he
wrote
the
signature
garratt
skinner
fell
back
in
his
chair
he
looked
about
him
with
a
dazed
air
as
though
he
expected
the
world
falling
to
pieces
around
him
why
that
next
door
to
forgery
he
whispered
in
a
voice
of
horror
guiding
the
hand
of
a
man
too
drunk
to
write
i
knew
archie
parminter
was
pretty
bad
but
i
never
thought
that
he
would
sink
to
that
i
am
not
sure
that
he
could
not
be
laid
by
the
heels
for
forgery
and
then
he
recovered
a
little
from
the
shock
but
you
ca
be
sure
sylvia
this
is
guesswork
of
yours
yes
guesswork
it
not
she
answered
i
told
you
that
the
floor
was
littered
with
slips
of
the
paper
on
which
hine
had
been
trying
to
write
yes
there
came
an
indefinable
change
in
garratt
skinner
face
he
leaned
forward
with
his
mouth
sternly
set
and
his
eyes
very
still
one
might
almost
have
believed
that
for
the
first
time
during
that
luncheon
he
was
really
anxious
really
troubled
well
this
morning
the
carpet
had
been
swept
the
litter
had
gone
but
just
underneath
the
one
of
those
crumpled
slips
of
paper
lay
not
quite
hidden
i
picked
it
up
it
was
a
check
have
you
got
it
sylvia
have
you
got
it
and
garratt
skinner
voice
in
steady
quietude
matched
his
face
yes
sylvia
opened
the
little
bag
which
she
carried
at
her
wrist
and
took
out
the
slip
of
paper
she
unfolded
it
and
spread
it
on
the
table
before
her
the
inside
was
pink
a
check
for
on
the
london
and
county
bank
victoria
street
she
said
garrett
skinner
looked
over
the
table
at
the
paper
there
was
wallie
hine
wavering
unfinished
signature
at
the
bottom
corner
parminter
had
guided
his
hand
as
far
as
the
end
of
the
christian
name
before
he
tore
the
check
out
and
threw
it
away
the
amount
of
the
body
of
the
check
had
been
filled
in
in
barstow
hand
you
had
better
give
it
to
me
sylvia
he
said
his
fingers
moving
restlessly
on
the
that
check
would
be
a
very
dangerous
thing
if
parminter
ever
came
to
hear
of
it
better
give
it
to
me
he
leaned
over
and
took
it
gently
from
before
her
and
put
it
carefully
away
in
his
pocket
now
you
see
there
more
reason
ever
why
we
should
get
wallie
hine
away
from
those
two
men
he
is
living
a
bad
life
here
three
weeks
in
the
country
may
set
his
thoughts
in
a
different
grove
will
you
make
this
sacrifice
sylvia
will
you
let
me
ask
him
it
will
be
a
good
action
you
see
he
does
know
any
geography
very
well
ask
him
father
garrett
skinner
reached
over
the
table
and
patted
her
hand
thank
you
my
dear
then
that
settled
i
propose
that
you
and
i
go
down
this
afternoon
can
you
manage
it
we
might
catch
the
four
train
from
waterloo
if
you
go
home
now
pack
up
your
traps
and
tell
the
housemaid
to
pack
mine
i
will
just
wind
up
my
business
and
come
home
in
time
to
pick
you
and
the
luggage
up
he
rose
from
the
table
and
calling
a
hansom
put
sylvia
into
it
he
watched
the
cab
drive
out
into
the
strand
and
turn
the
corner
then
he
went
back
to
the
table
and
asked
for
his
bill
while
he
waited
for
it
he
lit
a
match
and
drawing
from
his
pocket
the
crumpled
check
he
set
fire
to
it
he
held
it
by
the
corner
until
the
flame
burnt
his
fingers
then
he
dropped
it
in
his
plate
and
pounded
it
into
ashes
with
a
fork
that
was
a
bad
break
he
said
to
himself
left
carelessly
under
the
edge
of
the
a
very
bad
break
he
paid
his
bill
and
taking
his
hat
sauntered
out
into
the
strand
the
carelessness
which
had
left
the
check
underneath
the
was
not
however
the
only
bad
break
made
in
connection
with
this
affair
at
a
certain
moment
during
luncheon
garratt
skinner
had
unwisely
smiled
and
had
not
quite
concealed
the
smile
with
his
hand
against
her
every
wish
that
smile
forced
itself
upon
sylvia
recollections
as
she
drove
home
she
tried
to
interpret
it
in
every
pleasant
sense
but
it
kept
its
true
character
in
her
thoughts
try
as
she
might
it
remained
vividly
a
very
hateful
thing
the
smile
of
the
man
who
had
gulled
her
chapter
xii
the
house
of
the
running
water
a
week
later
on
a
sunlit
afternoon
sylvia
and
her
father
drove
northward
out
of
weymouth
between
the
marshes
and
the
bay
sylvia
was
silent
and
looked
about
her
with
expectant
eyes
i
have
been
lucky
sylvia
her
father
had
said
to
her
i
have
secured
for
our
summer
holiday
the
very
house
in
which
you
were
born
it
cost
me
some
trouble
but
i
was
determined
to
get
it
if
i
could
for
i
had
an
idea
that
you
would
be
pleased
however
you
are
not
to
see
it
until
it
is
quite
ready
there
was
a
prettiness
and
a
delicacy
in
this
thought
which
greatly
appealed
to
sylvia
he
had
spoken
it
with
a
smile
of
tenderness
affection
surely
could
alone
have
prompted
it
and
she
thanked
him
very
gratefully
they
were
now
upon
their
way
to
take
possession
a
little
white
house
set
back
under
a
hill
and
looking
out
across
the
bay
from
a
thick
cluster
of
trees
caught
sylvia
eye
was
that
the
house
she
wondered
the
carriage
turned
inland
and
passed
the
white
house
and
half
a
mile
further
on
turned
again
eastward
along
the
road
to
wareham
following
the
valley
which
runs
parallel
to
the
sea
they
ascended
the
long
steep
hill
which
climbs
to
osmington
until
upon
their
left
hand
a
narrow
road
branched
off
between
hawthorn
hedges
to
the
downs
the
road
dipped
to
a
little
hollow
and
in
the
hollow
a
little
village
nestled
a
row
of
white
cottages
with
leaded
opened
on
to
a
causeway
of
stone
flags
which
was
bordered
with
purple
phlox
and
raised
above
the
level
of
the
road
farther
on
the
roof
of
a
mill
rose
high
among
trees
and
an
open
space
showed
to
sylvia
the
black
massive
wheel
against
the
yellow
wall
and
then
the
carriage
stopped
at
a
house
on
the
side
and
garratt
skinner
got
out
here
we
are
he
said
it
was
a
small
square
house
of
the
georgian
days
built
of
old
brick
duskily
red
you
entered
it
at
the
side
and
the
big
level
windows
of
the
living
rooms
looked
out
upon
a
wide
and
garden
whence
a
little
door
under
a
brick
archway
in
the
wall
gave
a
second
entrance
on
to
the
road
into
this
garden
sylvia
wandered
if
she
had
met
with
but
few
people
who
matched
the
delicate
company
of
her
dreams
here
at
all
events
was
a
mansion
where
that
company
might
have
fitly
gathered
great
elms
and
beeches
bent
under
their
load
of
leaves
to
the
lawn
about
the
lawn
flowers
made
a
wealth
of
color
and
away
to
the
right
of
the
house
twisted
stems
and
branches
where
the
green
of
the
apples
was
turning
to
red
stood
evenly
spaced
in
a
great
orchard
and
the
mill
stream
tunneling
under
the
road
and
the
wall
ran
swiftly
between
green
banks
through
the
garden
and
the
orchard
singing
as
it
ran
there
lingered
she
thought
an
ancient
grace
about
this
old
garden
some
flavor
of
forgotten
days
as
in
a
room
scented
with
potpourri
and
she
walked
the
lawn
in
a
great
contentment
the
house
within
charmed
her
no
less
it
was
a
place
of
many
corners
and
quaint
nooks
and
of
a
flooring
so
unlevel
that
she
could
hardly
pass
from
one
room
to
another
without
taking
a
step
up
or
a
step
down
sylvia
went
about
the
house
quietly
and
with
a
certain
thoughtfulness
here
she
had
been
born
and
a
mystery
of
her
life
was
becoming
clear
to
her
on
this
summer
evening
the
windows
were
set
wide
in
every
room
and
thus
in
every
room
as
she
passed
up
and
down
she
heard
the
liquid
music
of
running
water
here
faint
like
a
whispered
melody
there
pleasant
like
laughter
but
nowhere
very
loud
and
everywhere
quite
audible
in
one
of
these
rooms
she
had
been
born
in
one
of
these
rooms
her
mother
had
slept
at
nights
during
the
weeks
before
she
was
born
with
that
music
in
her
ears
at
the
moment
of
sleep
and
at
the
moment
of
her
waking
sylvia
understood
now
why
she
had
always
dreamed
of
running
water
she
wondered
in
which
room
she
had
been
born
she
tried
to
remember
some
corner
of
the
house
some
nook
in
its
garden
and
that
she
could
not
awoke
in
her
a
strange
and
almost
eery
feeling
she
had
come
back
to
a
house
in
which
she
had
lived
to
a
scene
on
which
her
eyes
had
looked
to
sounds
which
had
murmured
in
her
ears
and
everything
was
as
utterly
new
to
her
and
unimagined
as
though
now
for
the
first
time
she
had
crossed
the
threshold
yet
these
very
surroundings
to
which
her
memory
bore
no
testimony
had
assuredly
modified
her
life
had
given
to
her
a
particular
possession
this
dream
of
running
water
and
had
made
it
a
veritable
element
of
her
nature
she
could
not
but
reflect
upon
this
new
knowledge
and
as
she
walked
the
garden
in
the
darkness
of
the
evening
she
built
upon
it
as
will
be
seen
as
she
stepped
back
over
the
threshold
into
the
library
where
her
father
sat
she
saw
that
he
was
holding
a
telegram
in
his
hand
wallie
hine
comes
my
dear
he
said
sylvia
looked
at
her
father
wistfully
it
is
a
pity
she
said
a
great
pity
it
would
have
been
pleasant
if
we
could
have
been
alone
the
warmth
of
her
gladness
had
gone
from
her
she
walked
once
more
in
shadows
there
was
in
her
voice
a
piteous
appeal
for
affection
for
love
of
which
she
had
had
too
little
in
her
life
and
for
which
she
greatly
craved
she
stood
by
the
door
her
lips
trembling
and
her
dark
eyes
for
a
wonder
glistening
with
tears
she
had
always
even
to
those
who
knew
her
to
be
a
woman
something
of
the
child
in
her
appearance
which
made
a
plea
from
her
lips
most
difficult
to
refuse
now
she
seemed
a
child
on
whom
the
world
pressed
heavily
before
her
time
for
suffering
had
come
she
had
so
motherless
a
look
even
garratt
skinner
moved
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
even
that
iron
man
was
stirred
i
too
am
sorry
sylvia
he
said
gently
but
we
will
make
the
best
of
it
between
us
and
he
laughed
gaily
setting
aside
from
him
his
momentary
compassion
we
will
teach
poor
wallie
hine
a
little
geography
wo
we
sylvia
had
no
smile
ready
for
a
reply
but
she
bowed
her
head
and
into
her
face
and
her
very
attitude
there
came
an
expression
of
patience
she
turned
and
opened
the
door
and
as
she
opened
it
and
stood
with
her
back
toward
her
father
she
said
in
a
quiet
and
clear
voice
very
well
and
so
passed
up
the
stairs
to
her
room
it
might
after
all
merely
be
kindness
in
her
father
which
had
led
him
to
insist
on
wallie
hine
visit
so
she
argued
and
the
more
persistently
because
she
felt
that
the
argument
was
thin
he
could
be
kind
he
had
been
thoughtful
for
her
during
the
past
week
in
the
small
attentions
which
appeal
so
much
to
women
because
he
saw
that
she
loved
flowers
he
had
engaged
a
new
gardener
for
their
stay
and
he
had
shown
in
one
particular
instance
a
quite
surprising
thoughtfulness
for
a
class
of
unhappy
men
with
whom
he
could
have
had
no
concern
the
convicts
in
portland
prison
that
instance
remained
for
a
long
time
vividly
in
her
mind
and
at
a
later
time
she
spoke
of
it
with
consequences
of
a
kind
she
thought
then
as
she
thought
now
only
of
the
kindness
of
her
father
action
and
for
the
first
week
of
hine
visit
that
thought
remained
with
her
she
was
on
the
alert
but
nothing
occurred
to
arouse
in
her
a
suspicion
there
were
no
cards
little
wine
was
drunk
and
early
hours
were
kept
by
the
whole
household
indeed
garratt
skinner
left
entirely
to
his
daughter
the
task
of
entertaining
his
guest
and
although
once
he
led
them
both
over
the
great
down
to
dorchester
and
back
at
a
pace
which
tired
his
companions
out
he
preferred
for
the
most
part
to
smoke
his
pipe
in
a
hammock
in
the
garden
with
a
novel
at
his
side
the
morning
after
that
one
expedition
he
limped
out
into
the
garden
rubbing
the
muscles
of
his
thigh
you
must
look
after
wallie
my
dear
he
said
age
is
beginning
to
find
me
out
and
after
all
he
will
learn
more
of
the
tact
and
manners
which
he
wants
from
you
than
from
a
rough
man
like
me
and
it
did
not
occur
to
sylvia
who
was
of
a
natural
modesty
of
thought
that
he
had
any
other
intention
of
throwing
them
thus
together
than
to
rid
himself
of
a
guest
with
whom
he
had
little
in
common
but
a
week
later
she
changed
her
mind
she
was
driving
walter
hine
one
morning
into
weymouth
and
as
the
turned
into
the
road
beside
the
bay
and
she
saw
suddenly
before
her
the
sea
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
the
dark
at
their
firing
practice
and
over
against
her
through
a
shimmering
haze
of
heat
the
crouching
mass
of
portland
she
drew
in
a
breath
of
pleasure
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
companion
gave
the
same
sign
of
enjoyment
and
she
turned
to
him
with
some
surprise
but
walter
hine
was
looking
to
the
wide
beach
so
black
with
holiday
makers
that
it
seemed
at
that
distance
a
great
and
busy
that
what
i
like
he
said
with
a
chuckle
of
anticipation
lot
people
i
knocked
about
too
long
in
the
thick
o
things
you
see
miss
sylvia
kept
it
up
i
have
seen
it
right
through
every
night
till
three
in
the
morning
for
months
at
a
time
oh
that
the
real
thing
he
broke
off
it
makes
you
feel
good
sylvia
laughed
then
if
you
dislike
the
country
she
said
and
perhaps
rather
eagerly
why
did
you
come
to
stay
with
us
at
all
and
suddenly
hine
leered
at
her
oh
you
know
he
said
and
almost
he
nudged
her
with
his
elbow
i
would
have
come
of
course
if
old
garratt
had
particularly
told
me
that
you
were
agreeable
sylvia
grew
hot
with
shame
she
drew
away
flicked
the
horse
with
her
whip
and
drove
on
had
she
been
used
she
wondered
to
lure
this
poor
helpless
youth
to
the
sequestered
village
where
they
stayed
and
a
chill
struck
through
her
even
on
that
day
of
july
the
plot
had
been
carefully
laid
if
that
were
so
she
was
to
be
hoodwinked
no
less
than
wallie
hine
what
sinister
thing
was
then
intended
she
tried
to
shake
off
the
dread
which
encompassed
her
pleading
to
herself
that
she
saw
perils
in
shadows
like
the
merest
child
but
she
had
not
yet
shaken
it
off
when
walter
hine
cried
out
excitedly
to
her
to
stop
look
he
said
and
he
pointed
toward
an
hotel
upon
the
which
at
that
moment
they
were
passing
sylvia
looked
and
saw
obsequiously
smirking
upon
the
steps
of
the
hotel
with
his
hat
lifted
from
his
shiny
head
her
old
enemy
captain
barstow
fortunately
she
had
not
stopped
she
drove
quickly
on
just
acknowledging
his
salute
it
needed
but
this
meeting
to
confirm
her
fears
it
was
not
coincidence
which
had
brought
captain
barstow
on
their
heels
to
weymouth
he
had
come
with
knowledge
and
a
definite
purpose
oh
i
say
protested
wallie
hine
you
might
have
stopped
miss
sylvia
and
let
me
pass
the
time
of
day
with
old
barstow
sylvia
stopped
the
trap
at
once
i
am
sorry
she
said
you
will
find
your
own
way
home
we
lunch
at
half
past
one
hine
looked
doubtfully
at
her
and
then
back
toward
the
hotel
i
did
mean
that
i
wanted
to
leave
you
miss
sylvia
he
said
not
by
a
long
chalk
but
you
must
leave
me
hine
she
said
looking
at
him
with
serious
eyes
if
you
want
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
your
friend
there
was
no
hint
of
a
smile
about
her
lips
she
waited
for
his
answer
it
came
accompanied
with
a
smile
which
aimed
at
gallantry
and
was
merely
familiar
of
course
i
stay
where
i
am
what
do
think
sylvia
hurried
over
her
shopping
and
drove
homeward
she
went
at
once
to
her
father
who
lay
in
the
hammock
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
reading
a
book
she
came
up
from
behind
him
across
the
grass
and
he
was
not
aware
of
her
approach
until
she
spoke
father
she
said
and
he
started
up
oh
sylvia
he
said
and
just
for
a
second
there
was
a
palpable
uneasiness
in
his
manner
he
had
not
merely
started
he
seemed
also
to
her
to
have
been
startled
but
he
recovered
his
composure
you
see
my
dear
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
he
said
and
he
pointed
to
a
man
at
work
among
the
i
saw
how
you
loved
flowers
how
you
liked
to
have
the
rooms
bright
with
them
so
i
hired
a
new
gardener
as
a
help
it
is
a
great
extravagance
sylvia
but
you
are
to
blame
not
i
he
smiled
confident
of
her
gratitude
and
had
it
been
but
yesterday
he
would
have
had
it
offered
to
him
in
full
measure
however
all
her
thoughts
were
poisoned
by
suspicion
she
knew
it
and
was
distressed
she
knew
how
much
happiness
so
simple
a
forethought
would
naturally
have
brought
to
her
she
did
not
indeed
suspect
any
new
peril
in
her
action
she
barely
looked
toward
the
new
gardener
and
certainly
neglected
to
note
whether
he
worked
skilfully
or
no
but
the
fears
of
the
morning
modified
her
thanks
moreover
the
momentary
uneasiness
of
her
father
had
not
escaped
her
notice
and
she
was
wondering
upon
its
cause
father
she
resumed
i
saw
captain
barstow
in
weymouth
this
morning
though
her
eyes
were
on
his
face
and
perhaps
because
her
eyes
were
resting
there
with
so
quiet
a
watchfulness
she
could
detect
no
now
garratt
skinner
stared
at
her
in
pure
astonishment
then
the
astonishment
gave
place
to
annoyance
barstow
he
said
angrily
he
lay
back
in
the
hammock
looking
up
to
the
boughs
overhead
his
face
wrinkled
and
perplexed
he
has
found
us
out
and
followed
us
sylvia
i
would
not
have
had
it
happen
for
worlds
did
he
see
you
yes
and
i
thought
that
here
at
all
events
we
were
safe
from
him
i
wonder
how
he
found
us
out
bribed
the
caretaker
in
hobart
place
i
suppose
sylvia
did
not
accept
this
suggestion
she
sat
down
upon
a
chair
in
a
disconcerting
silence
and
waited
garratt
skinner
crossed
his
arms
behind
his
head
and
deliberated
barstow
a
deep
fellow
sylvia
he
said
i
am
afraid
of
him
he
was
looking
up
to
the
boughs
overhead
but
he
suddenly
glanced
toward
her
and
then
quietly
removed
one
of
his
hands
and
slipped
it
down
to
the
book
which
was
lying
on
his
lap
sylvia
took
quiet
note
of
the
movement
the
book
had
been
lying
shut
upon
his
lap
with
its
back
toward
her
garratt
skinner
did
not
alter
its
position
but
she
saw
that
his
hand
now
hid
from
her
the
title
on
the
back
it
was
a
big
and
had
the
appearance
of
an
expensive
book
she
noticed
the
binding
green
cloth
boards
and
gold
lettering
on
the
back
she
was
not
familiar
with
the
look
of
it
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
might
as
well
know
and
as
quickly
as
possible
what
the
book
was
and
the
subject
with
which
it
dealt
meanwhile
garratt
skinner
repeated
a
deep
fellow
captain
barstow
and
anxiously
garratt
skinner
debated
how
to
cope
with
that
deep
fellow
he
came
at
last
to
his
conclusion
we
ca
shut
our
doors
to
him
sylvia
even
though
she
had
half
expected
just
that
answer
sylvia
flinched
as
she
heard
it
uttered
i
understand
your
feelings
my
dear
he
continued
in
tones
of
commiseration
for
they
are
mine
but
we
must
fight
the
barstows
with
the
barstows
weapons
it
would
never
do
for
us
to
close
our
doors
he
has
far
too
tight
a
hold
of
wallie
hine
as
yet
he
has
only
to
drop
a
hint
to
wallie
that
we
are
trying
to
separate
him
from
his
true
friends
and
keep
him
to
ourselves
and
just
think
my
dear
what
a
horrible
set
of
motives
a
creature
like
barstow
could
impute
to
us
let
us
be
candid
you
and
i
cried
garratt
skinner
starting
up
as
though
carried
away
by
candor
here
am
i
a
poor
man
here
are
you
my
daughter
a
girl
with
the
charm
and
the
beauty
of
the
spring
and
wallie
hine
rich
weak
and
susceptible
oh
there
a
story
for
a
barstow
to
embroider
but
sylvia
he
shall
not
so
much
as
hint
at
the
story
for
your
sake
my
dear
for
your
sake
cried
garratt
skinner
with
all
the
emphasis
of
a
loving
father
he
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
i
was
carried
away
by
my
argument
he
went
on
in
a
calmer
voice
sylvia
for
her
part
had
not
been
carried
away
at
all
and
no
doubt
her
watchful
composure
helped
him
to
subdue
as
ineffective
the
ardor
of
his
tones
barstow
has
only
to
drop
this
hint
to
wallie
hine
and
wallie
will
be
off
like
a
rabbit
at
the
sound
of
a
gun
and
there
our
chance
gone
of
helping
him
to
a
better
life
no
we
must
welcome
barstow
if
he
comes
here
yes
actually
welcome
him
however
repugnant
it
may
be
to
our
feelings
that
what
we
must
do
sylvia
he
must
have
no
suspicion
that
we
are
working
against
him
we
must
lull
him
to
sleep
that
is
our
only
way
to
keep
wallie
hine
with
us
so
that
sylvia
must
be
our
plan
of
campaign
the
luncheon
bell
rang
as
he
ended
his
oration
he
got
out
of
the
hammock
quickly
as
if
to
prevent
discussion
of
his
plan
and
the
book
which
he
was
carrying
caught
in
the
netting
of
the
hammock
and
fell
to
the
ground
sylvia
could
read
the
title
now
she
did
read
it
hastily
as
garratt
skinner
stooped
to
pick
it
up
it
was
entitled
the
alps
in
she
knew
the
book
by
repute
and
was
surprised
to
find
it
in
her
hands
she
was
surprised
still
more
that
he
should
have
been
at
so
much
pains
to
conceal
the
title
from
her
notice
after
all
what
could
it
matter
she
wondered
sylvia
lay
deep
in
misery
that
night
her
father
had
failed
her
utterly
all
the
high
hopes
with
which
she
had
set
out
from
chamonix
had
fallen
all
the
rare
qualities
with
which
her
dreams
had
clothed
him
as
in
shining
raiment
must
now
be
stripped
from
him
she
was
not
deceived
parminter
barstow
garratt
skinner
there
was
one
deep
fellow
in
that
trio
but
it
was
neither
barstow
nor
parminter
it
was
her
father
she
had
but
to
set
the
three
faces
side
by
side
in
her
thoughts
to
remember
the
differences
of
manner
mind
and
character
garratt
skinner
was
the
master
in
the
conspiracy
the
other
two
his
mere
servants
it
was
he
who
to
some
dark
end
had
brought
barstow
down
from
london
he
loomed
up
in
her
thoughts
as
a
relentless
and
sinister
figure
unswayed
by
affection
yet
with
the
power
to
counterfeit
it
for
evil
sparing
no
one
not
even
his
daughter
she
recalled
their
first
meeting
in
the
little
house
in
hobart
place
she
remembered
the
thoughtful
voice
with
which
as
he
had
looked
her
over
he
had
agreed
that
she
might
be
useful
she
thought
of
his
caresses
his
smile
of
affection
his
comradeship
and
she
shuddered
walter
hine
words
had
informed
her
to
what
use
her
father
had
designed
her
she
was
his
decoy
she
lay
upon
her
bed
with
her
hands
clenched
repeating
the
word
in
horror
his
decoy
the
moonlight
poured
through
the
open
window
the
music
of
the
stream
filled
the
room
she
was
in
the
house
in
which
she
had
been
born
a
place
mystically
sacred
to
her
thoughts
and
she
had
come
to
it
to
learn
that
she
was
her
father
decoy
in
a
vulgar
conspiracy
to
strip
a
weakling
of
his
money
the
stream
sang
beneath
her
windows
the
very
stream
of
which
the
echo
had
ever
been
rippling
through
her
dreams
always
she
had
thought
that
it
must
have
some
particular
meaning
for
her
which
would
be
revealed
in
due
time
she
dwelt
bitterly
upon
her
folly
there
was
no
meaning
in
its
light
laughter
in
a
while
she
was
aware
of
a
change
there
came
a
grayness
in
the
room
the
moonlight
had
lost
its
white
brilliance
the
night
was
waning
sylvia
rose
from
her
bed
and
slowly
like
one
very
tired
she
began
to
gather
together
and
pack
into
a
bag
such
few
clothes
as
she
could
carry
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
go
and
to
go
silently
before
the
house
waked
whither
she
was
to
go
and
what
she
was
to
do
once
she
had
gone
she
could
not
think
she
asked
herself
the
questions
in
vain
feeling
very
lonely
and
very
helpless
as
she
moved
softly
about
the
room
by
the
light
of
her
candle
her
friend
might
write
to
her
and
she
would
not
receive
his
letter
still
she
must
go
once
or
twice
she
stopped
her
work
and
crouching
down
upon
the
bed
allowed
her
tears
to
have
their
way
when
she
had
finished
her
preparations
she
blew
out
her
candle
and
leaning
upon
the
sill
of
the
open
window
gave
her
face
to
the
cool
night
air
there
was
a
break
in
the
eastern
sky
already
here
and
there
a
blackbird
sang
in
the
garden
boughs
and
the
freshness
the
quietude
swept
her
thoughts
back
to
the
chalet
de
lognan
with
a
great
yearning
she
recalled
that
evening
and
the
story
of
the
great
friendship
so
quietly
related
to
her
in
the
darkness
beneath
the
stars
the
world
and
the
people
of
her
dreams
existed
only
there
was
no
door
of
entrance
into
that
world
for
her
below
her
the
stream
sang
even
as
the
glacier
stream
had
sung
though
without
its
deep
note
of
thunder
as
she
listened
to
it
certain
words
spoken
upon
that
evening
came
back
to
her
mind
and
gradually
began
to
take
on
a
particular
application
what
you
know
that
you
must
do
if
by
doing
it
you
can
save
a
life
or
save
a
soul
that
was
the
law
if
you
can
save
a
life
or
save
a
soul
and
she
know
sylvia
raised
herself
from
the
window
and
stood
in
thought
garratt
skinner
had
made
a
great
mistake
that
day
he
had
been
misled
by
the
gentleness
of
her
ways
the
sweet
aspect
of
her
face
and
by
a
look
of
aloofness
in
her
eyes
as
though
she
lived
in
dreams
he
had
seen
surely
that
she
was
innocent
and
since
he
believed
that
knowledge
must
needs
corrupt
he
thought
her
ignorant
as
well
but
she
was
not
ignorant
she
had
detected
his
trickeries
she
knew
of
the
conspiracy
she
knew
of
the
place
she
filled
in
it
herself
and
furthermore
she
knew
that
as
a
decoy
she
had
been
doing
her
work
only
yesterday
walter
hine
had
been
forced
to
choose
between
barstow
and
herself
and
he
had
let
barstow
go
it
was
a
small
matter
no
doubt
still
there
was
promise
in
it
what
if
she
stayed
strengthened
her
hold
on
walter
hine
and
grappled
with
the
three
who
were
ranged
against
him
walter
hine
was
of
course
and
could
be
nothing
to
her
he
was
the
mere
puppet
the
opportunity
of
obedience
to
the
law
it
was
of
the
law
that
she
was
thinking
and
of
the
voice
of
the
man
who
had
uttered
it
she
knew
by
using
her
knowledge
she
could
save
a
soul
she
did
not
think
at
this
time
that
she
might
be
saving
a
life
too
quietly
she
undressed
and
slipped
into
her
bed
she
was
comforted
a
smile
had
come
upon
her
lips
she
saw
the
face
of
her
friend
in
the
darkness
very
near
to
her
she
needed
sleep
to
equip
herself
for
the
fight
and
while
thinking
so
she
slept
the
moonlight
faded
altogether
and
left
the
room
dark
beneath
the
window
the
stream
went
singing
through
the
lawn
after
all
its
message
had
been
revealed
to
her
in
its
due
season
chapter
xiii
chayne
returns
hullo
cried
captain
barstow
as
he
wandered
round
the
library
after
luncheon
here
a
he
took
the
gun
from
a
corner
where
it
stood
against
the
wall
opened
the
breech
shut
it
again
and
turning
to
the
open
window
lifted
the
stock
to
his
shoulder
i
wonder
whether
i
could
hit
anything
nowadays
he
said
taking
careful
aim
at
a
tulip
in
the
garden
any
cartridges
skinner
i
do
know
i
am
sure
garratt
skinner
replied
testily
the
newspapers
had
only
this
moment
been
brought
into
the
room
and
he
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
sylvia
had
never
noticed
that
gun
before
and
she
wondered
whether
it
had
been
brought
into
the
room
that
morning
she
watched
captain
barstow
bustle
into
the
hall
and
back
again
finally
he
pounced
upon
an
oblong
which
lay
on
the
top
of
a
low
he
removed
the
lid
and
pulled
out
a
cartridge
hullo
said
he
no
the
very
thing
i
am
going
to
take
a
pot
at
the
starlings
skinner
there
are
too
many
of
them
about
for
your
very
well
said
garratt
skinner
lazily
lifting
his
eyes
from
his
newspaper
and
looking
out
across
the
lawn
only
take
care
you
do
wing
my
new
gardener
no
fear
of
that
said
barstow
and
filling
his
pockets
with
cartridges
he
took
the
gun
in
his
hand
and
skipped
out
into
the
garden
in
a
moment
a
shot
was
heard
and
walter
hine
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
to
the
window
a
second
shot
followed
old
barstow
ca
shoot
for
nuts
said
hine
with
a
chuckle
and
in
his
turn
he
stepped
out
into
the
garden
sylvia
made
no
attempt
to
hinder
him
but
she
took
his
place
at
the
window
ready
to
intervene
a
flight
of
starlings
passed
straight
and
swift
over
barstow
head
he
fired
both
barrels
and
not
one
of
the
birds
fell
hine
spoke
to
him
and
the
gun
at
once
changed
hands
at
the
next
flight
hine
fired
and
one
of
the
birds
dropped
barstow
voice
was
raised
in
jovial
applause
that
was
a
good
egg
wallie
a
very
good
egg
let
me
try
now
and
so
alternately
they
shot
as
the
birds
darted
overhead
across
the
lawn
sylvia
waited
for
the
moment
when
barstow
aim
would
suddenly
develop
a
deadly
precision
but
that
moment
did
not
come
if
there
was
any
betting
upon
this
match
hine
would
not
be
the
loser
she
went
quietly
back
to
a
and
wrote
her
letters
she
had
no
wish
to
rouse
in
her
father
mind
a
suspicion
that
she
had
guessed
his
design
and
was
setting
herself
to
thwart
it
she
must
work
secretly
more
secretly
than
he
did
himself
meanwhile
the
firing
continued
in
the
garden
and
unobserved
by
sylvia
garratt
skinner
began
to
take
in
it
a
stealthy
interest
his
chair
was
so
placed
that
without
stirring
he
could
look
into
the
garden
and
at
the
same
time
keep
an
eye
on
sylvia
if
she
moved
an
elbow
or
raised
her
head
garratt
skinner
was
at
once
reading
his
paper
with
every
appearance
of
concentration
on
the
other
hand
her
back
was
turned
toward
him
so
that
she
saw
neither
his
keen
gaze
into
the
garden
nor
the
smile
of
amusement
with
which
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
his
daughter
in
this
way
perhaps
an
hour
passed
certainly
no
more
sylvia
had
in
fact
almost
come
to
the
end
of
her
letters
when
garratt
skinner
suddenly
pushed
back
his
chair
and
stood
up
at
the
noise
abrupt
as
a
startled
cry
sylvia
turned
swiftly
round
she
saw
that
her
father
was
gazing
with
a
look
of
perplexity
into
the
garden
and
that
for
the
moment
he
had
forgotten
her
presence
she
crossed
the
room
quickly
and
noiselessly
and
standing
just
behind
his
elbow
saw
what
he
saw
the
blood
flushed
her
throat
and
mounted
into
her
cheeks
her
eyes
softened
and
a
smile
of
welcome
transfigured
her
grave
face
her
friend
hilary
chayne
was
standing
under
the
archway
of
the
garden
door
he
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
but
he
had
not
moved
thereafter
and
he
was
not
looking
toward
the
house
his
attention
was
riveted
upon
the
sylvia
gave
no
thought
to
his
attitude
at
the
moment
he
had
come
that
was
enough
and
garratt
skinner
turning
about
saw
the
light
in
his
daughter
face
you
know
him
he
cried
roughly
yes
he
has
come
to
see
you
yes
you
should
have
told
me
said
garratt
skinner
angrily
i
dislike
secrecies
sylvia
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
her
father
steadily
in
the
face
but
garratt
skinner
was
not
so
easily
abashed
he
returned
her
look
as
steadily
who
is
he
he
continued
in
a
voice
of
authority
captain
hilary
chayne
it
seemed
for
a
moment
that
the
name
was
vaguely
familiar
to
garratt
skinner
and
sylvia
added
i
met
him
this
summer
in
switzerland
oh
i
see
said
her
father
and
he
looked
with
a
new
interest
across
the
garden
to
the
door
he
is
a
great
friend
my
only
friend
returned
sylvia
softly
and
her
father
stepped
forward
and
called
aloud
holding
up
his
hand
barstow
barstow
sylvia
noticed
then
and
not
till
then
that
the
coming
of
her
friend
was
not
the
only
change
which
had
taken
place
since
she
had
last
looked
out
upon
the
garden
the
new
gardener
was
now
shooting
alternately
with
walter
hine
while
captain
barstow
standing
a
few
feet
behind
them
recorded
the
hits
in
a
little
book
he
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
garratt
skinner
voice
and
perceiving
chayne
at
once
put
a
stop
to
the
match
garratt
skinner
turned
again
to
his
daughter
and
spoke
now
without
any
anger
at
all
there
was
just
a
hint
of
reproach
in
his
voice
but
as
though
to
lessen
the
reproof
he
laid
his
hand
affectionately
upon
her
arm
any
friend
of
yours
is
welcome
of
course
my
dear
but
you
might
have
told
me
that
you
expected
him
let
us
have
no
secrets
from
each
other
in
the
future
now
bring
him
in
and
we
will
see
if
we
can
give
him
a
cup
of
tea
he
rang
the
bell
sylvia
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
argue
that
chayne
coming
was
a
surprise
to
her
as
much
as
to
her
father
she
crossed
the
garden
toward
her
friend
but
she
walked
slowly
and
still
more
slowly
her
memories
had
flown
back
to
the
evening
when
they
had
bidden
each
other
on
the
little
platform
in
front
of
the
chalet
de
lognan
not
in
this
way
had
she
then
planned
that
they
should
meet
again
nor
in
such
company
the
smile
had
faded
from
her
lips
the
light
of
gladness
had
gone
from
her
eyes
barstow
and
walter
hine
were
moving
toward
the
house
it
mortified
her
exceedingly
that
her
friend
should
find
her
amongst
such
companions
she
almost
wished
that
he
had
not
found
her
out
at
all
and
so
she
welcomed
him
with
a
great
restraint
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
she
said
how
did
you
know
i
was
here
i
called
at
your
house
in
london
the
caretaker
gave
me
the
address
he
replied
he
took
her
hand
and
holding
it
looked
with
the
careful
scrutiny
of
a
lover
into
her
face
you
have
needed
those
memories
of
your
one
day
to
fall
back
upon
he
said
regretfully
already
you
have
needed
them
i
am
very
sorry
sylvia
did
not
deny
the
implication
of
the
words
that
troubles
had
come
she
turned
to
him
grateful
that
he
should
so
clearly
have
remembered
what
she
had
said
upon
that
day
thank
you
she
answered
gently
my
father
would
like
to
know
you
i
wrote
to
you
that
i
had
come
to
live
with
him
yes
you
were
surprised
she
asked
no
he
answered
quietly
you
came
to
some
important
decision
on
the
very
top
of
the
aiguille
that
i
knew
at
the
time
for
i
watched
you
when
i
got
your
letter
i
understood
what
the
decision
was
to
leave
chamonix
to
break
completely
with
her
life
it
was
just
to
that
decision
she
would
naturally
have
come
just
on
that
spot
during
that
one
sunlit
hour
so
much
his
own
love
of
the
mountains
taught
him
but
sylvia
was
surprised
at
his
insight
and
what
with
that
and
the
proof
that
their
day
together
had
remained
vividly
in
his
thoughts
she
caught
back
something
of
his
comradeship
as
they
crossed
the
lawn
to
the
house
her
embarrassment
diminished
she
drew
comfort
besides
from
the
thought
that
whatever
her
friend
might
think
of
captain
barstow
and
walter
hine
her
father
at
all
events
would
impress
him
even
as
she
had
been
impressed
chayne
would
see
at
once
that
here
was
a
man
head
and
shoulders
above
his
companions
finer
in
quality
different
in
speech
but
that
afternoon
her
humiliation
was
to
be
complete
her
father
had
no
fancy
for
the
intrusion
of
captain
chayne
into
his
quiet
and
sequestered
house
the
flush
of
color
on
his
daughter
face
the
leap
of
light
into
her
eyes
had
warned
him
he
had
no
wish
to
lose
his
daughter
chayne
too
might
be
inconveniently
watchful
garratt
skinner
desired
no
spy
upon
his
little
plans
consequently
he
set
himself
to
play
the
host
with
an
offensive
geniality
which
was
calculated
to
disgust
a
man
with
any
taste
for
good
manners
he
spoke
in
a
voice
which
sylvia
did
not
know
so
coarse
it
was
in
quality
so
boisterous
and
effusive
and
he
paraded
walter
hine
and
captain
barstow
with
the
pride
of
a
man
exhibiting
his
dearest
friends
you
must
know
barstow
captain
chayne
he
cried
slapping
the
little
man
lustily
on
the
back
one
of
the
very
best
you
are
both
brethren
of
the
sword
barstow
sniggered
obsequiously
and
screwed
his
into
his
eye
delighted
i
am
sure
but
i
sheathed
the
sword
some
time
ago
captain
chayne
and
exchanged
it
for
the
betting
book
chayne
added
quietly
barstow
laughed
nervously
oh
you
refer
to
our
little
match
in
the
garden
he
said
we
dragged
the
gardener
into
it
so
i
saw
chayne
replied
the
gardener
seemed
to
be
a
remarkable
shot
i
think
he
would
be
a
match
for
more
than
one
professional
and
turning
away
he
saw
sylvia
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
on
her
face
an
expression
of
trouble
and
dismay
so
deep
that
he
could
have
bitten
off
his
tongue
for
speaking
she
had
been
behind
him
while
he
had
spoken
and
though
he
had
spoken
in
a
low
voice
she
had
heard
every
word
she
bent
her
head
over
the
and
busied
herself
with
the
cups
but
her
hands
shook
her
face
burned
she
was
tortured
with
shame
she
had
set
herself
to
do
battle
with
her
father
and
already
in
the
first
skirmish
she
had
been
defeated
chayne
indiscreet
words
had
laid
bare
to
her
the
elaborate
conspiracy
the
new
gardener
the
gun
in
the
corner
the
cartridges
which
had
to
be
looked
for
barstow
want
of
skill
superiority
which
had
led
barstow
so
naturally
to
offer
to
back
the
gardener
against
him
all
was
clear
to
her
it
was
the
little
round
game
of
cards
all
over
again
and
she
had
not
possessed
the
wit
to
detect
the
trick
and
that
was
not
all
her
friend
had
witnessed
it
and
understood
she
heard
her
father
presenting
walter
hine
and
with
almost
intolerable
pain
she
realized
that
had
he
wished
to
leave
chayne
no
single
opportunity
of
misapprehension
he
would
have
spoken
just
these
words
and
no
others
wallie
is
the
grandson
and
indeed
the
heir
of
old
joseph
hine
you
know
his
name
no
doubt
joseph
hine
château
marlay
what
a
warm
man
joseph
hine
i
do
know
a
man
more
rich
treats
his
grandson
handsomely
into
the
bargain
eh
wallie
sylvia
felt
that
her
heart
would
break
that
garrett
skinner
admission
was
boldly
and
cunningly
deliberate
did
not
occur
to
her
she
simply
understood
that
here
was
the
last
necessary
piece
of
evidence
given
to
captain
chayne
which
would
convince
him
that
he
had
been
this
afternoon
the
witness
of
a
robbery
and
swindle
she
became
aware
that
chayne
was
standing
beside
her
she
did
not
lift
her
face
for
she
feared
that
it
would
betray
her
she
wished
with
all
her
heart
that
he
would
just
replace
his
cup
upon
the
tray
and
go
away
without
a
word
he
could
not
want
to
stay
he
could
not
want
to
return
he
had
no
place
here
if
he
would
go
away
quietly
without
troubling
to
take
leave
of
her
she
would
be
very
grateful
and
do
justice
to
him
for
his
kindness
but
though
he
had
the
mind
to
go
it
was
not
without
a
word
i
want
you
to
walk
with
me
as
far
as
the
door
he
said
gently
sylvia
rose
at
once
since
after
all
there
must
be
words
the
sooner
they
were
spoken
the
better
she
followed
him
into
the
garden
making
her
little
prayer
that
they
might
be
very
few
and
that
he
would
leave
her
to
fight
her
battle
and
to
hide
her
shame
alone
they
crossed
the
lawn
without
a
word
he
held
open
the
garden
door
for
her
and
she
passed
into
the
lane
he
followed
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
in
the
lane
a
hired
landau
was
waiting
chayne
pointed
to
it
i
want
you
to
come
away
with
me
now
he
said
and
since
she
looked
at
him
with
the
air
of
one
who
does
not
understand
he
explained
standing
quietly
beside
her
with
his
eyes
upon
her
face
and
though
he
spoke
quietly
there
was
in
his
eyes
a
hunger
which
belied
his
tones
and
though
he
stood
quietly
there
was
a
tension
in
his
attitude
which
betrayed
extreme
suspense
i
want
you
to
come
away
with
me
i
want
you
never
to
return
i
want
you
to
marry
me
the
blood
rushed
into
her
cheeks
and
again
fled
from
them
leaving
her
very
white
her
face
grew
mutinous
like
an
angry
child
but
her
eyes
grew
hard
like
a
resentful
woman
you
ask
me
out
of
pity
she
said
in
a
low
voice
that
not
true
he
cried
and
with
so
earnest
a
passion
that
she
could
not
but
believe
him
sylvia
i
came
here
meaning
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
i
ask
you
something
more
now
that
is
all
i
ask
you
to
come
to
me
a
little
sooner
that
is
all
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
now
sylvia
leaned
against
the
wall
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
please
he
said
making
his
appeal
with
a
great
simplicity
for
i
love
you
sylvia
she
gave
him
no
answer
she
kept
her
face
still
hid
and
only
her
heaving
breast
bore
witness
to
her
stress
of
feeling
gently
he
removed
her
hands
and
holding
them
in
his
urged
his
plea
ever
since
that
day
in
switzerland
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
sylvia
remembering
your
looks
your
smile
and
the
words
you
spoke
i
crossed
the
col
dolent
the
next
day
and
all
the
time
i
felt
that
there
was
some
great
thing
wanting
i
said
to
myself
miss
my
friend
i
was
wrong
sylvia
i
missed
you
something
ached
in
me
has
ached
ever
since
it
was
my
heart
come
with
me
now
sylvia
had
not
looked
at
him
though
she
made
no
effort
to
draw
her
hands
away
and
still
not
looking
at
him
she
answered
in
a
whisper
i
ca
i
ca
why
he
asked
why
you
are
not
happy
here
you
are
no
happier
than
you
were
at
chamonix
and
i
would
try
so
very
hard
to
make
you
happy
i
ca
leave
you
here
lonely
for
you
are
lonely
i
am
lonely
too
all
the
more
lonely
because
i
carry
about
with
me
you
you
as
you
stood
in
the
chalet
at
night
looking
through
the
open
window
with
the
striking
upward
on
your
face
and
with
your
reluctant
smile
upon
your
lips
you
as
you
lay
on
the
top
of
the
aiguille
with
the
wonder
of
a
new
world
in
your
eyes
you
as
you
said
in
the
sunset
and
went
down
the
winding
path
to
the
forest
if
you
only
knew
sylvia
yes
but
i
do
know
she
answered
and
now
she
looked
at
him
i
suppose
that
if
i
loved
i
should
know
i
should
understand
her
hands
lay
in
his
listless
and
unresponsive
to
the
pressure
of
his
she
spoke
slowly
and
thoughtfully
meeting
his
gaze
with
troubled
eyes
yet
you
were
glad
to
see
me
when
i
came
he
urged
glad
yes
you
are
my
friend
my
one
friend
i
was
very
glad
but
the
gladness
passed
when
you
asked
me
to
come
with
you
across
the
garden
i
was
wanting
you
to
go
away
the
words
hurt
him
they
could
not
but
hurt
him
but
she
was
so
plainly
unconscious
of
offence
she
was
so
plainly
trying
to
straighten
out
her
own
tangled
position
that
he
could
feel
no
anger
why
he
asked
and
again
she
frankly
answered
him
i
was
humbled
she
replied
and
i
have
had
so
much
humiliation
in
my
life
the
very
quietude
of
her
voice
and
the
wistful
look
upon
the
young
tired
face
hurt
him
far
more
than
her
words
had
done
sylvia
he
cried
and
he
drew
her
toward
him
come
with
me
now
my
dear
there
will
be
an
end
of
all
humiliation
we
can
be
married
we
can
go
down
to
my
home
on
the
sussex
downs
that
old
house
needs
a
mistress
sylvia
it
is
very
lonely
he
drew
a
breath
and
smiled
suddenly
and
i
would
like
so
much
to
show
you
it
to
show
you
all
the
corners
the
across
the
downs
the
woods
and
the
wide
view
from
arundel
to
chichester
spires
sylvia
come
just
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
she
leaned
toward
him
he
put
his
arm
about
her
and
held
her
for
a
moment
closer
but
her
head
was
lowered
not
lifted
up
to
his
and
then
she
freed
herself
gently
from
his
clasp
she
faced
him
with
a
little
wrinkle
of
thought
between
her
brows
and
spoke
with
an
air
of
wisdom
which
went
very
prettily
with
the
childlike
beauty
of
her
face
you
are
my
friend
she
said
a
friend
i
am
very
grateful
for
but
you
are
not
more
than
that
to
me
i
am
frank
you
see
i
am
thinking
now
of
reasons
which
would
not
trouble
me
if
i
loved
you
marriage
with
me
would
do
you
no
good
would
hurt
you
in
your
career
no
he
protested
but
i
am
thinking
that
it
would
she
replied
steadily
and
i
do
not
believe
that
i
should
give
much
thought
to
it
if
i
really
loved
you
i
am
thinking
of
something
else
too
and
she
spoke
more
boldly
choosing
her
words
with
care
of
a
plan
which
before
you
came
i
had
formed
of
a
task
which
before
you
came
i
had
set
myself
to
do
i
am
still
thinking
of
it
still
feeling
that
i
ought
to
go
on
with
it
i
do
not
think
that
i
should
feel
that
if
i
loved
i
think
nothing
else
would
count
at
all
except
that
i
loved
so
you
are
still
my
friend
and
i
can
not
go
with
you
chayne
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
sadly
with
a
mist
before
his
eyes
i
leave
you
to
much
unhappiness
he
said
and
i
hate
the
thought
of
it
not
quite
so
much
now
as
before
you
came
she
answered
i
am
proud
you
know
that
you
asked
me
and
putting
her
troubles
aside
she
smiled
at
him
bravely
as
though
it
was
he
who
needed
comforting
let
me
hear
of
you
through
your
success
so
again
they
said
at
the
time
of
sunset
chayne
mounted
into
the
landau
and
drove
back
along
the
road
to
weymouth
so
that
the
end
said
sylvia
she
opened
the
door
and
passed
again
into
the
garden
through
the
window
of
the
library
she
saw
her
father
and
walter
hine
watching
it
seemed
for
her
appearance
it
was
borne
in
upon
her
suddenly
that
she
could
not
meet
them
or
speak
with
them
and
she
ran
very
quickly
round
the
house
to
the
front
door
and
escaped
unaccosted
to
her
room
in
the
library
hine
turned
to
garratt
skinner
with
one
of
his
rare
flashes
of
shrewdness
she
did
want
to
meet
us
he
said
jealously
do
you
think
she
cares
for
him
i
think
replied
garratt
skinner
with
a
smile
that
captain
chayne
will
not
trouble
us
with
his
company
again
chapter
xiv
an
old
passion
betrays
a
new
secret
garratt
skinner
however
was
wrong
he
was
not
aware
of
the
great
revolution
which
had
taken
place
in
chayne
and
he
misjudged
his
tenacity
chayne
like
many
another
man
had
mapped
out
his
life
only
to
find
that
events
would
happen
in
a
succession
different
to
that
which
he
had
ordained
he
had
arranged
to
devote
his
youth
and
the
earlier
part
of
his
manhood
entirely
to
his
career
if
the
career
were
not
brought
to
a
premature
end
in
the
alps
that
possibility
he
had
always
foreseen
he
took
his
risks
with
full
knowledge
setting
the
gain
against
them
and
counting
them
worth
while
if
then
he
lived
he
proposed
at
some
indefinite
time
in
the
late
thirties
to
fall
in
love
and
marry
he
had
no
parents
living
there
was
the
empty
house
upon
the
sussex
downs
and
the
small
estate
which
for
generations
had
descended
from
father
to
son
marriage
was
thus
a
recognized
event
only
it
was
thrust
away
into
an
indefinite
future
but
there
had
come
an
evening
which
he
had
not
foreseen
when
sorely
grieved
by
the
loss
of
his
great
friend
he
had
fallen
in
with
a
girl
who
gave
with
open
hands
the
sympathy
he
needed
and
claimed
by
her
very
reticence
and
humility
his
sympathy
in
return
a
day
had
followed
upon
that
evening
and
thenceforth
the
image
of
sylvia
standing
upon
the
of
the
aiguille
with
a
few
strips
of
white
cloud
sailing
in
a
blue
sky
overhead
the
massive
pile
of
mont
blanc
in
front
freed
to
the
sunlight
which
was
her
due
remained
fixed
and
riveted
in
his
thoughts
he
began
in
imagination
to
refer
matters
of
moment
to
her
judgment
he
began
to
save
up
little
events
of
interest
that
he
might
remember
to
tell
them
to
her
he
understood
that
he
had
a
companion
even
when
he
was
alone
a
condition
which
he
had
not
anticipated
even
for
his
late
thirties
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
not
that
complete
ordering
of
his
life
on
which
he
had
counted
he
was
not
however
disappointed
he
seized
upon
the
good
thing
which
had
come
to
him
with
a
great
deal
of
wonder
and
a
very
thankful
heart
and
he
was
not
disposed
to
let
it
lightly
go
thus
the
vulgarity
which
garratt
skinner
chose
to
assume
the
unattractive
figure
of
barstow
and
the
obvious
swindle
which
was
being
perpetrated
on
walter
hine
had
the
opposite
effect
to
that
which
skinner
expected
chayne
instead
of
turning
his
back
upon
so
distasteful
a
company
frequented
it
in
the
resolve
to
take
sylvia
out
of
its
grasp
it
did
not
need
a
lover
to
see
that
she
slept
little
of
nights
and
passed
distressful
days
she
had
fled
from
her
mother
friends
at
chamonix
only
to
find
herself
helpless
amongst
a
worse
gang
in
her
father
house
very
well
she
must
be
released
he
had
proposed
to
take
her
away
then
and
there
she
had
refused
well
he
had
been
blunt
he
would
go
about
the
business
in
the
future
in
a
more
delicate
way
and
so
he
came
again
and
again
to
the
little
house
under
the
hill
where
the
stream
babbled
through
the
garden
and
every
day
the
apples
grew
redder
upon
the
boughs
but
it
was
disheartening
work
his
position
indeed
became
difficult
and
it
needed
all
his
tenacity
to
enable
him
to
endure
it
the
difficulty
became
very
evident
one
afternoon
early
in
august
and
the
afternoon
was
moveover
remarkable
in
that
garratt
skinner
was
betrayed
into
a
revelation
of
himself
which
was
to
bear
consequences
of
gravity
in
a
future
which
he
could
not
foresee
chayne
rode
over
upon
that
afternoon
and
found
garratt
skinner
alone
and
according
to
his
habit
stretched
at
in
his
hammock
with
a
cigar
between
his
lips
he
received
captain
chayne
with
the
utmost
geniality
he
had
long
since
laid
aside
his
ineffectual
vulgarity
of
manner
you
must
put
up
with
me
captain
chayne
he
said
my
daughter
is
out
however
she
i
ought
more
properly
to
say
they
will
be
back
no
doubt
before
long
they
being
sylvia
and
walter
hine
chayne
nodded
his
head
he
had
known
very
well
who
they
must
be
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
refrain
from
the
question
jealousy
had
hold
of
him
he
knew
nothing
of
sylvia
determination
to
acquire
a
power
greater
than
her
father
over
the
vain
and
defenceless
youth
the
words
with
which
she
had
hinted
her
plan
to
him
had
been
too
obscure
to
convey
their
meaning
he
was
simply
aware
that
sylvia
more
and
more
avoided
him
more
and
more
sought
the
companionship
of
walter
hine
and
such
experience
as
he
had
taught
him
that
women
were
as
apt
to
be
blind
in
their
judgment
of
men
as
men
in
their
estimation
of
women
he
sought
now
to
enlist
garratt
skinner
on
his
side
and
drawing
a
chair
nearer
to
the
hammock
he
sat
down
skinner
he
said
speaking
upon
an
impulse
you
have
no
doubt
in
your
mind
i
suppose
as
to
why
i
come
here
so
often
garratt
skinner
smiled
i
make
a
guess
i
admit
i
should
be
very
glad
if
your
daughter
would
marry
me
chayne
continued
and
i
want
you
to
give
me
your
help
i
am
not
a
poor
man
skinner
and
i
should
certainly
be
willing
to
recognize
that
in
taking
her
away
from
you
i
laid
myself
under
considerable
obligations
chayne
spoke
with
some
natural
hesitation
but
garratt
skinner
was
not
in
the
least
offended
i
will
not
pretend
to
misunderstand
you
he
replied
indeed
i
like
your
frankness
please
take
what
i
say
in
the
same
spirit
i
can
not
give
you
any
help
captain
chayne
why
garratt
skinner
raised
himself
upon
his
elbow
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
his
companion
face
said
distinctly
and
significantly
because
sylvia
has
her
work
to
do
here
chayne
in
his
turn
made
no
pretence
to
misunderstand
he
was
being
told
clearly
that
sylvia
was
in
league
with
her
father
and
captain
barstow
to
pluck
walter
hine
but
he
was
anxious
to
discover
how
far
garratt
skinner
cynicism
would
carry
him
will
you
define
the
work
he
asked
if
you
wish
it
replied
garratt
skinner
falling
back
in
his
hammock
i
should
have
thought
it
unnecessary
myself
the
work
is
the
reclaiming
of
wallie
hine
from
the
very
undesirable
company
in
which
he
has
mixed
do
you
understand
quite
said
chayne
he
understood
very
well
he
had
been
told
first
the
real
design
to
pluck
walter
hine
and
then
the
excuse
which
was
to
cloak
it
he
understood
too
the
reason
why
this
information
had
been
given
to
him
with
so
cynical
a
frankness
he
chayne
was
in
the
way
declare
the
swindle
and
persuade
him
that
sylvia
was
a
party
to
it
what
more
likely
way
could
be
discovered
for
getting
rid
of
captain
chayne
he
looked
at
his
smiling
companion
took
note
of
his
strong
aquiline
face
his
clear
and
steady
eyes
he
recognized
a
redoubtable
antagonist
but
he
leaned
forward
and
said
with
a
quiet
emphasis
skinner
i
have
nevertheless
not
lost
heart
garratt
skinner
laughed
in
a
friendly
way
i
suppose
not
it
is
only
in
the
wisdom
of
middle
age
that
we
lose
heart
in
youth
we
lose
our
hearts
a
very
different
thing
i
propose
still
to
come
to
this
house
as
often
as
you
will
captain
chayne
said
garratt
skinner
gaily
my
doors
are
always
open
to
you
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
give
you
a
romantic
interest
by
barring
you
out
garratt
skinner
had
another
reason
for
his
hospitality
which
he
kept
to
himself
he
was
inclined
to
believe
that
a
few
more
visits
from
captain
chayne
would
settle
his
chances
without
the
necessity
of
any
interference
it
was
garratt
skinner
business
as
that
of
any
other
rogue
to
play
with
simple
artifices
upon
the
faults
and
vanities
of
men
he
had
therefore
cultivated
a
habit
of
observation
he
had
become
naturally
attentive
to
trifles
which
others
might
overlook
and
he
was
aware
that
he
needed
to
go
very
warily
in
the
delicate
business
on
which
he
was
now
engaged
he
was
fighting
sylvia
for
the
possession
of
walter
hine
that
he
had
recognized
and
chayne
for
the
possession
of
sylvia
it
was
a
contest
and
he
had
in
consequence
kept
his
eyes
alert
he
had
noticed
that
chayne
was
growing
importunate
and
that
his
persistence
was
becoming
troublesome
to
sylvia
she
gave
him
a
less
warm
welcome
each
time
that
he
came
to
the
house
she
made
plans
to
prevent
herself
being
left
alone
with
him
and
if
by
chance
the
plans
failed
she
listened
rather
than
talked
and
listened
almost
with
an
air
of
boredom
come
as
often
as
you
please
consequently
said
garratt
skinner
from
his
hammock
and
now
let
us
talk
of
something
else
he
talked
of
nothing
for
a
while
but
it
was
plain
that
he
had
a
subject
in
his
thoughts
for
twice
he
turned
to
chayne
and
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
each
time
he
thought
silence
the
better
part
and
lay
back
again
chayne
waited
and
at
last
the
subject
was
broached
but
in
a
queer
hesitating
diffident
way
as
though
garratt
skinner
spoke
rather
under
a
compulsion
of
which
he
disapproved
tell
me
he
said
i
am
rather
interested
a
craze
an
infatuation
which
so
masters
people
must
be
interesting
even
to
the
like
myself
but
i
am
wrong
to
call
it
a
craze
from
merely
reading
books
i
think
it
a
passion
which
is
easily
intelligible
you
are
wondering
what
i
am
talking
about
my
daughter
tells
me
that
you
are
a
famous
climber
the
aiguille
i
suppose
up
which
you
were
kind
enough
to
accompany
her
is
not
a
very
difficult
mountain
it
depends
upon
the
day
said
chayne
and
the
state
of
the
snow
yes
that
is
what
i
have
gathered
from
the
books
every
mountain
may
become
dangerous
yes
each
mountain
said
garratt
skinner
thoughtfully
may
reward
its
conquerors
with
death
and
for
a
little
while
he
lay
looking
up
to
the
green
branches
interlaced
above
his
head
thus
each
mountain
on
the
brightest
day
holds
in
its
recesses
mystery
and
also
death
there
had
come
a
change
already
in
the
manner
of
the
two
men
they
found
themselves
upon
neutral
ground
their
faces
relaxed
from
wariness
they
were
no
longer
upon
their
guard
it
seemed
that
an
actual
comradeship
had
sprung
up
between
them
there
is
a
mountain
called
the
grépon
said
skinner
i
have
seen
pictures
of
it
a
strange
and
rather
attractive
pinnacle
with
its
slabs
of
rock
set
on
end
one
above
the
other
black
rock
splashed
with
red
and
the
overhanging
boulder
on
the
top
have
you
climbed
it
yes
there
is
a
crack
i
believe
a
good
place
to
get
you
into
training
chayne
laughed
with
the
enjoyment
of
a
man
who
recollects
a
stiff
difficulty
overcome
yes
to
the
right
of
the
col
between
the
grépon
and
the
charmoz
there
is
a
step
half
way
up
otherwise
there
is
very
little
hold
and
the
crack
is
very
steep
they
talked
of
other
peaks
such
as
the
charmoz
where
the
first
lines
of
ascent
had
given
place
to
others
more
recently
discovered
of
new
variations
new
ascents
and
pinnacles
still
unclimbed
and
then
garratt
skinner
said
i
saw
that
a
man
actually
crossed
the
col
des
nantillons
early
this
summer
it
used
to
be
called
the
col
de
blaitière
he
was
killed
with
his
guide
but
after
the
real
dangers
were
passed
that
seems
to
happen
at
times
chayne
looked
at
garratt
skinner
in
surprise
it
is
strange
that
you
should
have
mentioned
john
lattery
death
he
said
slowly
why
asked
garratt
skinner
turning
quietly
toward
his
companion
i
read
of
it
in
times
oh
yes
no
doubt
it
was
described
what
i
meant
was
this
john
lattery
was
my
great
friend
and
he
was
a
distant
kind
of
cousin
to
your
friend
walter
hine
and
indeed
with
him
to
joseph
hine
great
fortune
his
death
i
suppose
has
doubled
your
friend
inheritance
garratt
skinner
raised
himself
up
on
his
elbow
the
announcement
was
really
news
to
him
is
that
so
he
asked
it
is
true
then
the
mountains
hold
death
too
in
their
recesses
even
on
the
clearest
day
yes
they
hold
death
too
and
letting
himself
fall
gently
back
upon
his
cushions
he
remained
for
a
while
with
a
very
thoughtful
look
upon
his
face
twice
chayne
spoke
to
him
and
twice
he
did
not
hear
he
lay
absorbed
it
seemed
that
a
new
and
engrossing
idea
had
taken
possession
of
his
mind
and
when
he
turned
his
eyes
again
to
chayne
and
spoke
he
appeared
to
be
speaking
with
reference
to
that
idea
rather
than
to
any
remarks
of
his
companion
did
you
ever
ascend
mont
blanc
by
the
brenva
route
he
asked
a
thin
ridge
of
ice
i
read
an
account
in
moore
you
have
to
straddle
across
the
ridge
with
a
leg
hanging
down
either
precipice
chayne
shook
his
head
lattery
and
i
meant
to
try
it
this
summer
the
dent
du
requin
as
well
ah
that
is
one
of
the
modern
rock
scrambles
is
it
the
last
two
or
three
hundred
feet
are
the
trouble
i
believe
and
so
the
talk
went
on
and
the
comradeship
grew
but
chayne
noticed
that
always
garratt
skinner
came
back
to
the
great
climbs
of
the
earlier
mountaineers
the
brenva
ascent
of
mont
blanc
the
col
dolent
the
two
points
of
the
aiguille
du
dru
and
the
aiguille
verte
but
you
too
have
climbed
chayne
cried
at
length
on
winter
nights
by
my
fireside
replied
garratt
skinner
with
a
smile
i
have
a
lame
leg
which
would
hinder
me
nevertheless
you
left
miss
sylvia
and
myself
behind
when
you
led
us
over
the
hills
to
dorchester
it
was
walter
hine
who
interrupted
he
had
come
across
the
grass
from
behind
and
neither
of
the
two
men
had
noticed
his
approach
but
the
moment
when
he
did
interrupt
marked
a
change
in
their
demeanor
the
comradeship
which
had
so
quickly
bloomed
as
quickly
faded
it
was
the
flower
of
an
idle
moment
antagonism
preceded
and
followed
it
thus
one
might
imagine
might
sentries
at
the
outposts
of
opposing
armies
pile
their
arms
for
half
an
hour
and
gossip
of
their
homes
or
their
children
or
of
something
dear
to
both
of
them
and
separate
at
the
bugle
sound
garratt
skinner
swung
himself
out
of
his
hammock
where
sylvia
wallie
she
went
up
to
her
room
chayne
waited
for
ten
minutes
and
for
another
ten
and
still
sylvia
did
not
appear
she
was
avoiding
him
she
could
spend
the
afternoon
with
walter
hine
but
she
must
run
to
her
room
when
he
came
upon
the
scene
jealousy
flamed
up
in
him
every
now
and
then
a
whimsical
smile
of
amusement
showed
upon
garratt
skinner
face
and
broadened
into
a
grin
chayne
was
looking
a
fool
and
was
quite
conscious
of
it
he
rose
abruptly
from
his
chair
i
must
be
going
he
said
over
loudly
and
garratt
skinner
smiled
i
afraid
she
wo
hear
that
he
said
softly
measuring
with
his
eyes
the
distance
between
the
group
and
the
house
but
come
again
captain
chayne
and
sit
it
out
chayne
flushed
with
anger
he
said
thank
you
and
tried
to
say
it
jauntily
and
failed
he
took
his
leave
and
walked
across
the
lawn
to
the
garden
trying
to
assume
a
carriage
of
indifference
and
dignity
but
every
moment
he
expected
to
hear
the
two
whom
he
had
left
laughing
at
his
discomfiture
neither
however
did
laugh
walter
hine
was
indeed
indignant
why
did
you
ask
him
to
come
again
he
asked
angrily
as
the
garden
door
closed
upon
chayne
garratt
skinner
laid
his
hand
on
walter
hine
arm
do
you
worry
wallie
he
said
confidentially
every
time
chayne
comes
here
he
loses
ten
marks
give
him
rope
he
does
not
after
all
know
a
great
deal
of
geography
chapter
xv
kenyon
john
lattery
chayne
returned
to
london
on
the
following
day
restless
and
troubled
jealousy
he
knew
was
the
natural
lot
of
the
lover
but
that
he
should
have
to
be
jealous
of
a
walter
hine
there
was
the
sting
he
asked
the
old
question
over
and
over
again
the
old
futile
question
which
the
unrewarded
suitor
puts
to
himself
with
amazement
and
a
despair
at
the
ridiculous
eccentricities
of
human
nature
what
in
the
world
can
she
see
in
the
fellow
however
he
did
not
lose
heart
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
let
go
once
he
had
clearly
set
his
desires
upon
a
particular
goal
sooner
or
later
people
and
things
would
adjust
themselves
to
their
proper
proportions
in
sylvia
eyes
meanwhile
there
was
something
to
be
done
a
doubt
to
be
set
at
rest
perhaps
a
discovery
to
be
made
his
conversation
with
garratt
skinner
the
subject
which
garratt
skinner
had
chosen
and
the
knowledge
with
which
he
had
spoken
had
seemed
to
chayne
rather
curious
a
man
might
sit
by
his
fireside
and
follow
with
interest
nay
almost
with
the
passion
of
the
mountaineer
the
history
of
alpine
exploration
and
adventure
that
had
happened
before
now
and
very
likely
chayne
would
have
troubled
himself
no
more
about
garratt
introduction
of
the
theme
but
for
one
or
two
circumstances
which
the
more
he
reflected
upon
them
became
the
more
significant
for
instance
garratt
skinner
had
spoken
and
had
asked
questions
about
the
new
ascents
made
the
new
passes
crossed
within
the
last
twenty
years
just
as
a
man
would
ask
who
had
obtained
his
knowledge
out
of
books
but
of
the
earlier
ascents
he
had
spoken
differently
though
the
difference
was
subtle
and
hard
to
define
he
seemed
to
be
upon
more
familiar
ground
he
left
in
chayne
mind
a
definite
suspicion
that
he
was
speaking
no
longer
out
of
books
but
from
an
intimate
personal
knowledge
the
knowledge
of
actual
experience
the
suspicion
had
grown
up
gradually
but
it
had
strengthened
almost
into
a
conviction
it
was
to
the
old
climbs
that
garratt
skinner
conversation
perpetually
recurred
the
aiguille
verte
the
grand
and
the
petit
dru
and
the
traverse
between
them
the
col
dolent
the
grandes
jorasses
and
the
brenva
route
yes
above
all
the
brenva
route
up
mont
blanc
moreover
how
in
the
world
should
he
know
that
those
slabs
of
black
granite
on
the
top
of
the
grépon
were
veined
with
red
splashed
with
red
as
he
described
them
unless
he
had
ascended
them
or
the
aiguille
des
charmoz
opposite
how
should
he
know
the
philosophy
of
his
guide
michel
revailloud
flashed
across
chayne
mind
one
needs
some
one
with
whom
to
exchange
one
memories
had
garratt
skinner
felt
that
need
and
felt
it
with
so
much
compulsion
that
he
must
satisfy
it
in
spite
of
himself
yet
why
should
he
practise
concealment
at
all
there
certainly
had
been
concealment
chayne
remembered
how
more
than
once
garratt
skinner
had
checked
himself
before
at
last
he
had
yielded
it
was
in
spite
of
himself
that
he
had
spoken
and
then
suddenly
as
the
train
drew
up
at
vauxhall
station
for
the
tickets
to
be
collected
chayne
started
up
in
his
seat
on
the
rocks
of
the
argentière
beside
the
great
gully
as
they
descended
to
the
glacier
sylvia
guide
had
spoken
words
which
came
flying
back
into
thoughts
she
had
climbed
that
day
though
it
was
her
first
mountain
as
if
knowledge
of
the
craft
had
been
born
in
her
how
to
stand
upon
an
how
to
hold
her
ax
she
had
known
on
the
rocks
too
which
foot
to
advance
with
which
hand
to
grasp
the
hold
she
had
known
suppose
that
knowledge
been
born
in
her
why
then
those
words
of
her
guide
began
to
acquire
significance
she
had
reminded
him
of
some
one
some
one
whose
name
he
could
not
remember
but
some
one
with
whom
years
ago
he
had
climbed
and
then
upon
the
rocks
some
chance
movement
of
sylvia
some
way
in
which
she
moved
from
ledge
to
ledge
had
revealed
to
him
the
name
gabriel
strood
was
it
possible
chayne
asked
if
so
what
dark
thing
was
there
in
the
record
of
strood
life
that
he
must
change
his
name
disappear
from
the
world
and
avoid
the
summer
nights
the
days
of
sunshine
and
storm
on
the
high
and
the
chayne
was
minded
to
find
an
answer
to
that
question
sylvia
was
in
trouble
that
house
under
the
downs
was
no
place
for
her
he
himself
was
afraid
of
what
was
being
planned
there
it
might
help
him
if
he
knew
something
more
of
garratt
skinner
than
he
knew
at
present
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
just
a
chance
of
acquiring
that
knowledge
he
dined
at
his
club
and
at
ten
walked
up
james
street
the
street
was
empty
it
was
a
hot
starlit
night
of
the
first
week
in
august
and
there
came
upon
him
a
swift
homesickness
for
the
world
above
the
how
many
of
his
friends
were
sleeping
that
night
in
mountain
huts
high
up
on
the
shoulders
of
the
mountains
or
in
bivouacs
open
to
the
stars
with
a
at
their
backs
and
a
fire
of
pine
wood
blazing
at
their
feet
most
likely
amongst
those
friends
was
the
one
he
sought
still
there
a
chance
that
i
may
find
him
he
pleaded
and
crossing
piccadilly
passed
into
dover
street
half
way
along
the
street
of
milliners
he
stopped
before
a
house
where
a
famous
scholar
had
his
lodging
is
kenyon
in
london
he
asked
and
the
replied
to
his
great
relief
yes
sir
but
he
is
not
yet
at
home
i
will
wait
for
him
said
chayne
he
was
shown
into
the
study
and
left
there
with
a
lighted
lamp
the
room
was
lined
with
books
from
floor
to
ceiling
chayne
mounted
a
ladder
and
took
down
from
a
high
corner
some
volumes
bound
simply
in
brown
cloth
they
were
volumes
of
the
alpine
journal
he
had
chosen
those
which
dated
back
from
twenty
years
to
a
quarter
of
a
century
he
drew
a
chair
up
beside
the
lamp
and
began
eagerly
to
turn
over
the
pages
often
he
stopped
for
the
name
of
which
he
was
in
search
often
leaped
to
his
eyes
from
the
pages
chayne
read
of
the
exploits
in
the
alps
of
gabriel
strood
more
than
one
new
expedition
was
described
many
variations
of
old
ascents
many
climbs
already
familiar
it
was
clear
that
the
man
was
of
the
true
brotherhood
a
new
climb
was
very
well
but
the
old
were
as
good
to
gabriel
strood
and
the
climb
which
he
had
once
made
he
had
the
longing
to
repeat
with
new
companions
none
of
the
descriptions
were
written
by
strood
himself
but
all
by
companions
whom
he
had
led
and
most
of
them
bore
testimony
to
an
unusual
endurance
an
unusual
courage
as
though
strood
triumphed
perpetually
over
a
difficulty
which
his
companions
did
not
share
and
of
which
only
vague
hints
were
given
at
last
chayne
came
to
that
very
narrative
which
sylvia
had
been
reading
on
her
way
to
chamonix
and
there
the
truth
was
bluntly
told
for
the
first
time
chayne
started
up
in
that
dim
and
quiet
room
thrilled
he
had
the
proof
now
under
his
finger
the
indisputable
proof
gabriel
strood
suffered
from
an
affection
of
the
muscles
in
his
right
thigh
and
yet
managed
to
all
his
rivals
hine
words
drummed
in
chayne
ears
nevertheless
he
left
us
all
behind
garratt
skinner
gabriel
strood
surely
surely
he
replaced
the
volumes
and
took
others
down
in
the
first
which
he
opened
it
was
the
autumn
number
of
nineteen
years
ago
there
was
again
mention
of
the
man
and
the
climb
described
was
the
ascent
of
mont
blanc
from
the
brenva
glacier
chayne
leaned
back
in
his
chair
fairly
startled
by
this
confirmation
it
was
to
the
brenva
route
that
garratt
skinner
had
continually
harked
back
the
aiguille
verte
the
grandes
jorasses
the
charmoz
the
blaitière
yes
he
had
talked
of
them
all
but
ever
he
had
come
back
with
an
eager
voice
and
a
fire
in
his
eyes
to
the
of
the
brenva
route
chayne
searched
on
through
the
pages
but
there
was
nowhere
in
any
volume
on
which
he
laid
his
hands
any
further
record
of
his
exploits
others
who
followed
in
his
steps
mentioned
his
name
but
of
the
man
himself
there
was
no
word
more
no
one
had
climbed
with
him
no
one
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
above
the
for
five
or
six
seasons
he
had
flashed
through
the
alps
arolla
zermatt
the
montanvert
the
concordia
hut
all
had
known
him
for
five
or
six
seasons
and
then
just
under
twenty
years
ago
he
had
come
no
more
chayne
put
back
the
volumes
in
their
places
on
the
shelf
and
sat
down
again
in
the
before
the
empty
grate
it
was
a
strange
and
a
haunting
story
which
he
was
gradually
piecing
together
in
his
thoughts
men
like
gabriel
strood
come
back
to
the
alps
they
sleep
too
restlessly
at
nights
they
needs
must
come
and
yet
this
man
had
stayed
away
there
must
have
been
some
great
impediment
he
fell
into
another
train
of
thought
sylvia
was
eighteen
nearly
nineteen
had
gabriel
strood
married
just
after
that
last
season
when
he
climbed
from
the
brenva
glacier
to
the
calotte
the
story
was
still
not
unraveled
and
while
he
perplexed
his
fancies
over
the
unraveling
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
pointed
beard
stood
upon
the
threshold
he
was
a
man
of
fifty
years
his
shoulders
were
just
learning
how
to
stoop
and
his
face
fine
and
delicate
yet
lacking
nothing
of
strength
wore
an
aspect
of
melancholy
as
though
he
lived
much
alone
until
he
smiled
and
in
the
smile
there
was
much
companionship
and
love
he
smiled
now
as
he
stretched
out
his
long
hand
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
chayne
he
said
in
a
voice
remarkable
for
its
gentleness
although
in
another
way
i
am
sorry
i
am
sorry
because
of
course
i
know
why
you
are
in
england
and
not
among
the
alps
chayne
had
risen
from
his
chair
but
kenyon
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
forced
him
down
again
with
a
friendly
pressure
i
read
of
death
i
am
grieved
about
it
for
you
as
much
as
for
lattery
i
know
just
what
that
kind
of
loss
means
it
means
very
much
said
he
letting
his
eyes
rest
with
sympathy
upon
the
face
of
the
younger
man
kenyon
put
a
whisky
and
soda
by
chayne
elbow
and
setting
the
tobacco
jar
on
a
little
table
between
them
sat
down
and
lighted
his
pipe
you
came
back
at
once
he
asked
i
crossed
the
col
dolent
and
went
down
into
italy
replied
chayne
yes
yes
said
kenyon
nodding
his
head
but
you
will
go
back
next
year
or
the
year
after
perhaps
said
chayne
and
for
a
little
while
they
smoked
their
pipes
in
silence
then
chayne
came
to
the
object
of
his
visit
kenyon
he
asked
have
you
any
photographs
of
the
people
who
went
climbing
twenty
to
years
ago
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
have
some
groups
taken
in
switzerland
in
those
days
if
you
have
i
should
like
to
see
them
yes
i
think
i
have
said
kenyon
he
went
to
his
and
opening
a
drawer
took
out
a
number
of
photographs
he
brought
them
back
and
moving
the
lamp
so
that
the
light
fell
clear
and
strong
upon
the
little
table
laid
them
down
chayne
bent
over
them
with
a
beating
heart
was
his
suspicion
to
be
confirmed
or
disproved
one
by
one
he
took
the
photographs
closely
examined
them
and
laid
them
aside
while
kenyon
stood
upright
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
he
had
turned
over
a
dozen
before
he
stopped
he
held
in
his
hand
the
picture
of
a
swiss
hotel
with
an
open
space
before
the
door
in
the
open
space
men
were
gathered
they
were
talking
in
groups
some
of
them
leaned
upon
some
carried
upon
their
backs
as
though
upon
the
point
of
starting
for
the
hills
as
he
held
the
photograph
a
little
nearer
to
the
lamp
and
bent
his
head
a
little
lower
kenyon
made
a
slight
uneasy
movement
but
chayne
did
not
notice
he
sat
very
still
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
photograph
on
the
outskirts
of
the
group
stood
sylvia
father
younger
slighter
of
build
with
a
face
unlined
and
a
boyish
grace
which
had
long
since
gone
but
undoubtedly
sylvia
father
the
contours
of
the
mountains
told
chayne
clearly
enough
in
what
valley
the
hotel
stood
this
is
zermatt
he
said
without
lifting
his
eyes
yes
replied
kenyon
quietly
a
zermatt
you
are
too
young
to
know
and
then
chayne
forefinger
dropped
upon
the
figure
of
sylvia
father
who
is
this
he
asked
kenyon
made
no
answer
it
is
gabriel
strood
chayne
continued
there
was
a
pause
and
then
kenyon
confirmed
the
guess
yes
he
said
and
some
hint
of
emotion
in
his
voice
made
chayne
lift
his
eyes
the
light
striking
upward
through
the
green
shade
gave
to
kenyon
face
an
extraordinary
pallor
but
it
seemed
to
chayne
that
not
all
the
pallor
was
due
to
the
lamp
for
six
seasons
chayne
said
gabriel
strood
came
to
the
alps
in
his
first
season
he
made
a
great
name
he
was
the
best
climber
i
have
ever
seen
replied
kenyon
he
had
a
passion
for
the
mountains
yet
after
six
years
he
came
back
no
more
he
disappeared
why
kenyon
stood
absolutely
silent
absolutely
still
perhaps
the
trouble
deepened
a
little
on
his
face
but
that
was
all
chayne
however
was
bent
upon
an
answer
for
sylvia
sake
alone
he
must
have
it
he
must
know
the
father
into
whose
clutches
she
had
come
you
knew
gabriel
strood
why
kenyon
leaned
forward
and
gently
took
the
photograph
out
of
hand
he
mixed
it
with
the
others
not
giving
to
it
a
single
glance
himself
and
then
replaced
them
all
in
the
drawer
from
which
he
had
taken
them
he
came
back
to
the
table
and
at
last
answered
chayne
john
lattery
was
your
friend
some
of
the
best
hours
of
your
life
were
passed
in
his
company
you
know
that
now
but
you
will
know
it
still
more
surely
when
you
come
to
my
age
whatever
happiness
may
come
to
you
between
now
and
then
the
the
for
your
floor
and
the
black
night
about
you
for
walls
the
hours
of
talk
the
ridge
and
the
the
bad
times
in
storm
and
mist
the
good
times
in
the
sunshine
the
cold
nights
of
hunger
when
you
were
caught
by
the
darkness
the
when
you
lounged
at
your
ease
you
wo
forget
john
lattery
kenyon
spoke
very
quietly
but
with
a
conviction
and
indeed
a
certain
solemnity
which
impressed
his
companion
no
said
chayne
gently
i
shall
not
forget
john
lattery
but
his
question
was
still
unanswered
and
by
nature
he
was
tenacious
his
eyes
were
still
upon
kenyon
face
and
he
added
what
then
only
this
said
kenyon
gabriel
strood
was
my
john
lattery
and
moving
round
the
table
he
dropped
his
hand
upon
chayne
shoulder
you
will
ask
me
no
more
questions
he
said
with
a
smile
i
beg
your
pardon
said
chayne
he
had
his
answer
he
knew
now
that
there
was
something
to
conceal
that
there
was
a
definite
reason
why
gabriel
strood
disappeared
he
said
and
as
he
left
the
room
he
saw
kenyon
sink
down
into
his
there
seemed
something
sad
and
very
lonely
in
the
attitude
of
the
older
man
once
more
michel
revailloud
warning
rose
up
within
his
mind
when
it
is
all
over
and
you
go
home
take
care
that
there
is
a
lighted
lamp
in
the
room
and
the
room
not
empty
have
some
one
to
share
your
memories
when
life
is
nothing
but
memories
at
every
turn
the
simple
philosophy
of
michel
revailloud
seemed
to
obtain
an
instance
and
a
confirmation
was
that
to
be
his
own
fate
too
just
for
a
moment
he
was
daunted
he
closed
the
door
noiselessly
and
going
down
the
stairs
let
himself
out
into
the
street
the
night
was
clear
above
his
head
how
was
it
above
the
downs
of
dorsetshire
he
wondered
he
walked
along
the
street
very
slowly
garratt
skinner
was
gabriel
strood
there
was
clearly
a
dark
reason
for
the
metamorphosis
it
remained
for
chayne
to
discover
that
reason
but
he
did
not
ponder
any
more
upon
that
problem
he
was
merely
thinking
as
he
walked
along
the
street
that
michel
revailloud
was
a
very
wise
man
chapter
xvi
as
between
gentlemen
between
gentlemen
said
wallie
hine
yes
between
gentlemen
he
was
quoting
from
a
letter
which
he
held
in
his
hand
as
he
sat
at
the
breakfast
table
and
in
his
agitation
he
had
quoted
aloud
garratt
skinner
looked
up
from
his
plate
and
said
can
i
help
you
wallie
hine
flushed
red
and
stammered
out
no
thank
you
i
must
run
up
to
town
this
morning
that
all
sylvia
will
drive
you
into
weymouth
in
the
after
breakfast
said
garratt
skinner
and
he
made
no
further
reference
to
the
journey
but
he
glared
at
the
handwriting
of
the
letter
and
then
with
some
perplexity
at
walter
hine
you
will
be
back
this
evening
i
suppose
rather
said
walter
hine
with
a
smile
across
the
table
at
sylvia
but
his
agitation
got
the
better
of
his
gallantry
and
as
she
drove
him
into
weymouth
he
spoke
as
piteously
as
a
child
appealing
for
protection
i
do
want
to
go
one
little
bit
miss
sylvia
but
between
gentlemen
yes
i
must
forget
that
between
gentlemen
he
clung
to
the
phrase
finding
some
comfort
in
its
reiteration
you
have
given
me
your
promise
said
sylvia
there
will
be
no
cards
no
bets
walter
hine
laughed
bitterly
i
sha
break
it
i
have
had
my
lesson
by
jove
i
have
walter
hine
traveled
to
waterloo
and
drove
straight
to
the
office
of
jarvice
i
owe
some
money
he
began
bleating
the
words
out
the
moment
he
was
ushered
into
the
inner
office
jarvice
grinned
this
interview
is
concluded
he
said
there
the
door
i
owe
it
to
a
friend

hine
continued
in
desperation
a
thousand
pounds
he
has
written
for
it
he
says
that
debts
of
honor
between
gentlemen
but
he
got
no
further
for
jarvice
broke
in
upon
his
faltering
explanations
with
a
snarl
of
contempt
barstow
you
poor
little
innocent
i
have
something
else
to
do
with
my
money
than
to
pour
it
into
barstow
pockets
i
know
the
man
send
him
to
me
and
i
talk
to
him
as
between
gentlemen
walter
hine
flushed
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
deference
and
flatteries
in
the
household
of
garratt
skinner
the
unceremonious
scorn
of
jarvice
stung
his
vanity
and
vanity
was
the
one
strong
element
of
his
character
he
was
in
the
mind
hotly
to
defend
captain
barstow
from
jarvice
insinuations
but
he
refrained
then
barstow
will
know
that
i
draw
my
allowance
from
you
and
not
from
my
grandfather
he
stammered
there
was
the
trouble
for
walter
hine
if
barstow
knew
garratt
skinner
would
come
to
know
there
would
be
an
end
to
the
deference
and
the
flatteries
he
would
no
longer
be
able
to
pose
as
the
favorite
of
the
great
millionaire
joseph
hine
he
would
sink
in
sylvia
eyes
at
the
cost
of
any
humiliation
that
downfall
must
be
avoided
his
words
however
had
an
immediate
effect
upon
jarvice
though
for
quite
other
reasons
why
that
true
said
jarvice
slowly
and
in
a
voice
suddenly
grown
smooth
yes
yes
we
do
want
to
mix
up
my
name
in
the
affair
at
all
sit
down
hine
and
take
a
cigar
the
box
is
at
your
elbow
young
men
of
spirit
must
have
some
extra
license
allowed
to
them
for
the
sake
of
the
promise
of
their
riper
years
i
was
forgetting
that
no
we
do
want
my
name
to
appear
at
all
do
we
publicity
had
no
charms
for
jarvice
indeed
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
had
found
it
quite
a
hindrance
to
the
development
of
his
little
plans
to
go
his
own
quiet
way
unheralded
by
the
press
and
unacclaimed
of
men
that
was
the
modest
ambition
of
jarvice
however
i
do
look
forward
to
handing
over
a
thousand
pounds
to
captain
barstow
he
continued
softly
no
indeed
did
you
lose
any
of
your
first
quarter
allowance
to
him
besides
the
thousand
walter
hine
lit
his
cigar
and
answered
reluctantly
yes
all
of
it
oh
no
no
not
all
of
it
jarvice
did
not
press
for
the
exact
amount
he
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
there
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
back
toward
his
visitor
walter
hine
watched
his
shoulders
in
suspense
and
apprehension
he
would
have
been
greatly
surprised
if
he
could
have
caught
a
glimpse
at
this
moment
of
jarvice
face
there
was
no
anger
no
contempt
expressed
in
it
at
all
on
the
contrary
a
quiet
smile
of
satisfaction
gave
to
it
almost
a
merry
look
jarvice
had
certain
plans
for
walter
hine
future
so
he
phrased
it
with
a
smile
for
the
grim
humor
of
the
phrase
and
fate
seemed
to
be
helping
toward
their
fulfilment
i
can
get
you
out
of
this
scrape
no
doubt
said
jarvice
turning
back
to
his
table
the
means
i
must
think
over
but
i
can
do
it
only
a
condition
you
need
not
be
alarmed
a
little
condition
which
a
loving
father
might
impose
upon
his
only
son
and
jarvice
beamed
paternally
as
he
resumed
his
seat
what
is
the
condition
asked
walter
hine
that
you
travel
for
a
year
broaden
your
mind
by
visiting
the
great
countries
and
capitals
of
europe
take
a
little
trip
perhaps
into
the
east
and
return
a
cultured
gentleman
well
equipped
to
occupy
the
high
position
which
will
be
yours
when
your
grandfather
is
in
due
time
translated
to
a
better
sphere
jarvice
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
with
a
confident
wave
of
his
desk
ruler
had
the
air
of
producing
the
startling
metamorphosis
like
some
heavy
but
benevolent
fairy
walter
hine
however
was
not
attracted
by
the
prospect
but
he
began
and
at
once
jarvice
interrupted
him
i
anticipate
you
he
said
with
a
smile
standing
at
the
window
there
i
foresaw
your
objection
but
it
would
be
lonely
quite
true
why
should
you
be
lonely
and
so
i
am
going
to
lay
my
hands
on
some
pleasant
and
companionable
young
fellow
who
will
go
with
you
for
his
expenses
an
oxford
man
eh
fresh
from
alma
mater
with
a
taste
for
pictures
and
statuettes
and
that
sort
of
thing
upon
my
word
i
envy
you
hine
if
i
were
young
bless
me
if
i
would
throw
my
bonnet
over
the
mill
as
after
a
few
weeks
in
la
ville
lumière
you
will
be
saying
and
go
with
you
you
will
taste
life
yes
life
and
as
he
repeated
the
word
all
the
jollity
died
suddenly
out
of
the
face
of
jarvice
he
bent
his
eyes
somberly
upon
his
visitor
and
a
queer
inscrutable
smile
played
about
his
lips
but
walter
hine
had
no
eyes
for
jarvice
he
was
nerving
himself
to
refuse
the
proposal
i
ca
go
he
blurted
out
with
the
ungracious
stubbornness
of
a
weak
mind
which
fears
to
be
afraid
lest
he
should
consent
he
refused
aggressively
and
rudely
jarvice
repressed
an
exclamation
of
anger
and
why
he
asked
leaning
forward
on
his
elbows
and
fixing
his
bright
sharp
eyes
on
walter
hine
face
walter
hine
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
but
did
not
answer
and
why
ca
you
go
he
repeated
i
ca
tell
you
oh
surely
said
jarvice
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
sneer
come
now
between
gentlemen
well
walter
hine
yielded
to
jarvice
insistence
there
a
girl
he
said
with
a
coy
and
odious
smile
jarvice
beat
upon
his
desk
with
his
fists
in
a
savage
anger
his
carefully
calculated
plan
was
to
be
thwarted
by
a
girl
she
a
dear
cried
walter
hine
having
made
the
admission
he
let
himself
go
his
vanity
pricked
him
to
lyrical
flights
she
a
dear
she
a
sob
she
would
never
let
me
go
she
my
little
girl
such
was
sylvia
reward
for
engaging
in
a
struggle
which
she
loathed
for
the
salvation
of
walter
hine
she
was
jubilantly
claimed
by
him
as
his
little
girl
in
a
office
jarvice
swore
aloud
who
is
she
he
asked
sternly
a
faint
sense
of
shame
came
over
walter
hine
he
dimly
imagined
what
sylvia
would
have
thought
and
said
and
what
contempt
her
looks
would
have
betrayed
had
she
heard
him
thus
boast
of
her
goodwill
you
are
asking
too
much
jarvice
he
said
jarvice
waved
the
objection
aside
of
course
i
ask
it
as
between
gentlemen
he
said
with
an
ironical
politeness
well
then
as
between
gentlemen
returned
walter
hine
seriously
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
great
friend
of
mine
garratt
skinner
the
matter
he
cried
and
there
was
reason
for
his
cry
it
had
been
an
afternoon
of
surprises
for
jarvice
but
this
simple
mention
of
the
name
of
garratt
skinner
was
more
than
a
surprise
jarvice
was
positively
startled
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
eyes
staring
at
walter
hine
the
high
color
paled
in
his
face
and
his
cheeks
grew
mottled
it
seemed
that
fear
as
well
as
surprise
came
to
him
in
the
knowledge
that
garratt
skinner
was
a
friend
of
walter
hine
what
is
the
matter
repeated
hine
it
nothing
replied
jarvice
hastily
the
heat
that
is
all
he
crossed
the
room
and
throwing
up
the
window
leaned
for
a
few
moments
upon
the
sill
yet
even
when
he
spoke
again
there
was
still
a
certain
unsteadiness
in
his
voice
how
did
you
come
across
garratt
skinner
he
asked
barstow
introduced
me
i
made
barstow
acquaintance
at
the
criterion
bar
and
he
took
me
to
garratt
skinner
house
in
hobart
place
i
see
said
jarvice
it
was
in
garratt
skinner
house
that
you
lost
your
money
i
suppose
yes
but
he
had
no
hand
in
it
exclaimed
walter
hine
he
does
not
know
how
much
i
lost
he
would
be
angry
if
he
did
a
faint
smile
flickered
across
jarvice
face
quite
so
he
agreed
and
under
his
deft
the
whole
story
was
unfolded
the
little
dinner
at
which
sylvia
made
her
appearance
and
at
which
walter
hine
was
carefully
primed
with
drink
the
little
round
game
of
cards
which
garratt
skinner
was
so
reluctant
to
allow
in
his
house
on
a
sunday
evening
and
from
which
being
an
early
riser
he
retired
to
bed
leaving
hine
in
the
hands
of
captain
barstow
and
archie
parminter
the
quiet
secluded
house
in
the
country
the
new
gardener
who
appeared
for
one
day
and
shot
with
so
surprising
an
accuracy
when
barstow
backed
him
against
walter
hine
that
hine
lost
a
thousand
pounds
the
incidents
were
related
to
jarvice
in
their
proper
succession
and
he
interpreted
them
by
his
own
experience
captain
barstow
who
was
always
to
the
fore
counted
for
nothing
in
the
story
as
jarvice
understood
it
he
was
the
mere
creature
the
servant
garratt
skinner
who
was
always
in
the
background
prepared
the
swindle
and
pocketed
the
profits
you
are
staying
at
the
quiet
house
in
dorsetshire
now
i
suppose
just
you
and
garratt
skinner
and
the
pretty
daughter
with
occasional
visits
from
barstow
yes
answered
hine
garratt
skinner
does
not
care
to
see
much
company
once
more
the
smile
of
amusement
played
upon
jarvice
face
no
i
suppose
not
he
said
quietly
there
were
certain
definite
reasons
of
which
he
was
aware
to
account
for
garratt
reluctance
to
appear
in
a
general
company
he
turned
back
from
the
window
and
returned
to
his
table
he
had
taken
his
part
there
was
no
longer
either
unsteadiness
or
anger
in
his
voice
i
quite
understand
your
reluctance
to
leave
your
new
friends
he
said
with
the
utmost
friendliness
i
recognize
that
the
tour
abroad
on
which
i
had
rather
set
my
heart
must
be
abandoned
but
i
have
no
regrets
for
i
think
it
possible
that
the
very
object
which
i
had
in
mind
when
proposing
that
tour
may
be
quite
as
easily
effected
in
the
charming
country
house
of
garratt
skinner
he
spoke
in
a
quiet
voice
looking
benevolently
at
his
visitor
if
the
words
were
capable
of
another
and
a
more
sinister
meaning
than
they
appeared
to
convey
walter
hine
did
not
suspect
it
he
took
them
in
their
obvious
sense
yes
i
shall
gain
as
much
culture
in
garratt
skinner
house
as
i
should
by
seeing
abroad
he
said
eagerly
and
then
jarvice
smiled
i
think
that
very
likely
he
said
meanwhile
as
to
barstow
and
his
thousand
pounds
i
must
think
the
matter
over
barstow
will
not
press
you
for
a
day
or
two
just
leave
me
your
address
the
address
in
dorsetshire
he
dipped
a
pen
in
the
ink
and
handed
it
to
hine
hine
took
it
and
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
toward
him
but
he
did
not
set
the
pen
to
the
paper
he
looked
suddenly
up
at
jarvice
who
stood
over
against
him
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
garratt
skinner
address
he
said
with
one
of
his
flashes
of
cunning
yes
since
you
are
staying
there
i
shall
want
to
write
to
you
walter
hine
still
hesitated
you
wo
peach
to
garratt
skinner
about
the
allowance
eh
my
dear
fellow
said
jarvice
he
was
more
hurt
than
offended
to
put
it
on
the
lowest
ground
what
could
i
gain
walter
hine
wrote
down
the
address
and
at
once
the
clerk
appeared
at
the
door
and
handed
jarvice
a
card
i
will
see
him
said
jarvice
and
turning
to
hine
our
business
is
over
i
think
jarvice
opened
a
second
door
which
led
from
the
inner
office
straight
down
a
little
staircase
into
the
street
you
shall
hear
from
me
he
said
and
walter
hine
went
out
jarvice
closed
the
door
and
turned
back
to
his
clerk
that
will
do
he
said
there
was
no
client
waiting
at
all
jarvice
had
an
ingenious
contrivance
for
getting
rid
of
his
clients
at
the
critical
moment
after
they
had
come
to
a
decision
and
before
they
had
time
to
change
their
minds
by
pressing
a
particular
button
in
the
leather
covering
of
the
right
arm
of
his
chair
he
moved
an
indicator
above
the
desk
of
his
clerk
in
the
outer
office
the
clerk
thereupon
announced
a
visitor
and
the
one
in
occupation
was
bowed
out
by
the
private
staircase
by
this
method
walter
hine
had
been
dismissed
jarvice
had
the
address
of
garratt
skinner
but
he
sat
with
it
in
front
of
him
upon
his
desk
for
a
long
time
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
use
it
all
the
amiability
had
gone
from
his
expression
now
that
he
was
alone
he
was
in
a
savage
mood
and
every
now
and
then
a
violent
gesture
betrayed
it
but
it
was
with
himself
that
he
was
angry
he
had
been
a
fool
not
to
keep
a
closer
watch
on
walter
hine
i
might
have
foreseen
he
cried
in
his
exasperation
garratt
skinner
if
i
had
not
been
an
ass
i
have
foreseen
for
jarvice
was
no
stranger
to
walter
hine
new
friend
more
than
one
young
buck
fresh
from
the
provinces
heir
to
the
great
factory
or
the
great
estate
had
been
steered
into
this
inner
office
by
the
careful
pilotage
of
garratt
skinner
in
all
the
army
of
the
men
who
live
by
their
wits
there
was
not
one
to
jarvice
knowledge
who
was
so
alert
as
garratt
skinner
to
lay
hands
upon
the
new
victim
or
so
successful
in
lulling
his
suspicions
he
might
have
foreseen
that
garratt
skinner
would
throw
his
net
over
walter
hine
but
he
had
not
and
the
harm
was
done
jarvice
took
the
insurance
policy
from
his
safe
and
shook
his
head
over
it
sadly
he
had
seen
his
way
to
making
in
his
quiet
fashion
and
at
comparatively
little
cost
a
tidy
little
sum
of
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
now
he
must
take
a
partner
so
that
he
might
not
have
an
enemy
garratt
skinner
with
barstow
for
his
jackal
and
the
pretty
daughter
for
his
decoy
was
too
powerful
a
factor
to
be
lightly
regarded
jarvice
must
share
with
garratt
skinner
unless
he
preferred
to
abandon
his
scheme
altogether
and
that
jarvice
would
not
do
there
was
no
other
way
jarvice
knew
well
that
he
could
weaken
garratt
skinner
influence
over
walter
hine
by
revealing
to
the
youth
certain
episodes
in
the
new
friend
life
he
might
even
break
the
acquaintanceship
altogether
but
garratt
skinner
would
surely
discover
who
had
been
at
work
and
then
why
then
jarvice
would
have
upon
his
heels
a
shrewd
and
watchful
enemy
and
in
this
particular
business
such
an
enemy
jarvice
could
not
afford
to
have
jarvice
was
not
an
impressionable
man
but
his
hands
grew
cold
while
he
imagined
garratt
skinner
watching
the
development
of
his
little
scheme
the
tour
abroad
with
the
pleasant
companion
the
things
which
were
to
happen
on
the
tour
watching
and
waiting
until
the
fitting
moment
had
come
when
all
was
over
for
him
to
step
in
and
demand
the
price
of
his
silence
and
hold
jarvice
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
for
all
his
life
no
that
would
never
do
garratt
skinner
must
be
a
partner
so
that
also
he
might
be
an
accessory
accordingly
jarvice
wrote
his
letter
to
garratt
skinner
a
few
lines
urging
him
to
come
to
london
on
most
important
business
never
was
there
a
letter
more
innocent
in
its
appearance
than
that
which
jarvice
wrote
in
his
inner
office
on
that
summer
afternoon
yet
even
at
the
last
he
hesitated
whether
he
should
seal
it
up
or
no
the
sun
went
down
shadows
touched
with
long
cool
fingers
the
burning
streets
shadows
entered
into
that
little
inner
office
of
jarvice
but
still
he
sat
undecided
at
his
desk
the
tour
upon
the
continent
must
be
abandoned
and
with
it
the
journey
under
canvas
to
the
near
east
a
scheme
so
simple
so
sure
so
safe
still
garratt
skinner
might
confidently
be
left
to
devise
another
and
he
had
always
kept
faith
to
that
comforting
thought
jarvice
clung
he
sealed
up
his
letter
in
the
end
and
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
with
the
darkness
deepening
about
him
then
he
rang
for
his
clerk
and
bade
him
post
it
but
the
voice
he
used
was
one
which
the
clerk
did
not
know
so
that
he
pushed
his
head
forward
and
peered
through
the
shadows
to
make
sure
that
it
was
his
master
who
spoke
two
days
afterward
garratt
skinner
paid
a
long
visit
to
jarvice
and
that
some
agreement
was
reached
between
the
two
men
shortly
became
evident
for
walter
hine
received
a
letter
from
captain
barstow
which
greatly
relieved
him
garratt
skinner
has
written
to
me
wrote
the
captain
that
he
has
discovered
that
the
gardener
whom
he
engaged
for
a
particular
job
is
notorious
as
a
poacher
and
a
shot
under
these
circumstances
my
dear
old
fellow
the
one
can
not
pouch
your
pennies
as
between
gentlemen
the
bet
must
be
considered
chapter
xvii
sylvia
tells
more
than
she
knows
hilary
chayne
stayed
away
from
dorsetshire
for
ten
complete
days
and
though
the
hours
crept
by
dilatory
as
idlers
at
a
street
corner
he
obtained
some
poor
compensation
by
reflecting
upon
his
fine
diplomacy
in
less
than
a
week
he
would
surely
be
missed
by
the
time
that
ten
days
had
passed
the
sensation
might
have
become
simply
poignant
so
for
ten
days
he
wandered
about
the
downs
of
sussex
with
an
aching
heart
saying
the
while
it
serves
her
right
on
the
morning
of
the
eleventh
he
received
a
letter
from
the
war
office
bidding
him
call
on
the
following
afternoon
that
will
just
do
he
said
i
will
go
down
to
weymouth
and
i
will
return
to
london
and
with
an
unusual
lightness
of
spirit
which
he
ascribed
purely
to
his
satisfaction
that
he
need
punish
sylvia
no
longer
he
started
off
upon
his
long
journey
he
reached
the
house
of
the
running
water
by
six
in
the
evening
and
at
the
outset
it
seemed
that
his
diplomacy
had
been
sagacious
he
was
shown
into
the
library
and
opposite
to
him
by
the
window
sylvia
stood
alone
she
turned
to
him
a
white
face
gazed
at
him
for
a
second
like
one
dazed
and
then
with
a
low
cry
of
welcome
came
quickly
toward
him
chayne
caught
her
outstretched
hands
and
all
his
joy
at
her
welcome
lay
dead
at
the
sight
of
her
distress
sylvia
he
exclaimed
in
distress
he
was
hurt
by
it
as
he
had
never
thought
to
be
hurt
i
am
afraid
she
said
in
a
trembling
whisper
he
drew
her
toward
him
and
she
yielded
she
stood
close
to
him
and
very
still
touching
him
leaning
to
him
like
a
frightened
child
oh
i
am
afraid
she
repeated
and
her
voice
appealed
piteously
for
sympathy
and
a
little
kindness
in
chayne
mind
there
was
suddenly
painted
a
picture
of
the
on
the
aiguille
a
girl
had
moved
from
step
to
step
across
that
slope
looking
down
its
steep
glittering
incline
without
a
tremor
it
was
the
same
girl
who
now
leaned
to
him
and
with
shaking
lips
and
eyes
tortured
with
fear
cried
i
am
afraid
by
his
recollection
of
that
day
upon
the
heights
chayne
measured
the
greatness
of
her
present
trouble
why
sylvia
why
are
you
afraid
for
answer
she
looked
toward
the
open
window
chayne
followed
her
glance
and
this
was
what
he
saw
the
level
stretch
of
emerald
lawn
the
stream
running
through
it
and
catching
in
its
brown
water
the
red
light
of
the
evening
sun
the
great
beech
trees
casting
their
broad
shadows
the
high
garden
walls
with
the
dusky
red
of
their
bricks
glowing
amongst
fruit
trees
and
within
that
enclosure
pacing
up
and
down
in
and
out
among
the
shadows
of
the
trees
garratt
skinner
and
walter
hine
yet
that
sight
she
must
needs
have
seen
before
why
should
it
terrify
her
beyond
reason
now
do
you
see
sylvia
said
in
a
low
troubled
voice
for
once
distress
had
mastered
her
and
she
spoke
without
her
usual
reticence
there
can
be
no
friendship
between
those
two
no
real
friendship
you
have
but
to
see
them
side
by
side
to
be
sure
of
it
it
is
pretence
yet
that
too
she
must
have
known
before
why
then
should
the
pretence
now
so
greatly
trouble
her
chayne
watched
the
two
men
pacing
in
the
garden
certainly
he
had
never
seen
them
in
so
intimate
a
comradeship
garratt
skinner
had
passed
his
arm
through
walter
hine
and
held
him
so
plying
him
with
stories
bending
down
his
keen
furrowed
aquiline
face
toward
him
as
though
he
had
no
thought
in
the
world
but
to
make
him
his
friend
and
bind
him
with
affection
and
walter
hine
looked
up
and
listened
and
laughed
a
vain
weak
wisp
of
a
creature
flattered
to
the
skies
and
defenceless
as
a
rabbit
why
the
pretence
said
sylvia
why
the
linked
arms
the
pretence
has
grown
during
these
last
days
what
new
thing
is
intended
her
eyes
were
on
the
garden
and
as
she
looked
it
seemed
that
her
terror
grew
my
father
went
away
a
week
ago
since
he
has
returned
the
pretence
has
increased
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
garratt
skinner
turned
in
his
walk
and
led
walter
hine
back
toward
the
house
sylvia
shrank
from
his
approach
as
from
something
devilish
when
he
turned
again
she
drew
her
breath
like
one
escaped
from
sudden
peril
sylvia
of
what
are
you
afraid
i
do
know
she
cried
that
just
the
trouble
i
do
know
she
clenched
her
hands
together
at
her
breast
chayne
caught
them
in
his
and
was
aware
that
in
one
shut
palm
she
held
something
which
she
concealed
her
clasp
tightened
upon
it
as
his
hands
touched
hers
sylvia
had
more
reason
for
her
fears
than
she
had
disclosed
barstow
came
no
more
there
were
no
more
cards
no
more
bets
and
this
change
taken
together
with
garratt
skinner
increased
friendship
added
to
her
apprehensions
she
dreaded
some
new
plot
more
sinister
more
terrible
than
that
one
of
which
she
was
aware
if
only
i
knew
she
cried
oh
if
only
i
knew
archie
parminter
had
paid
one
visit
to
the
house
had
stayed
for
one
night
and
he
and
garratt
skinner
and
walter
hine
had
sat
up
till
morning
talking
together
in
the
library
sylvia
waking
up
from
a
fitful
sleep
had
heard
their
voices
again
and
again
through
the
dark
hours
and
when
the
dawn
was
gray
she
had
heard
them
coming
up
to
bed
as
on
the
first
night
of
her
return
and
as
on
that
night
there
was
one
who
stumbled
heavily
it
was
since
that
night
that
terror
had
distracted
her
i
have
no
longer
any
power
she
said
something
has
happened
to
destroy
my
power
i
have
no
longer
any
influence
something
was
done
upon
that
night
and
she
shivered
as
though
she
guessed
and
she
looked
at
her
clenched
hand
as
though
the
clue
lay
hidden
in
its
palm
there
lay
her
great
trouble
she
had
lost
her
influence
over
walter
hine
she
had
knowledge
of
the
under
side
of
life
yes
but
her
father
had
a
greater
knowledge
still
he
had
used
his
greater
knowledge
craftily
and
with
a
most
ingenious
subtlety
he
had
destroyed
her
power
he
had
blunted
her
weapons
hine
was
attracted
by
sylvia
fascinated
by
her
charm
her
looks
and
the
gentle
simplicity
of
her
manner
very
well
on
the
other
side
garratt
skinner
had
held
out
a
lure
of
greater
attractions
greater
fascination
and
sylvia
was
powerless
he
has
changed
sylvia
went
on
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
walter
hine
oh
not
merely
toward
me
he
has
changed
physically
can
you
understand
he
has
grown
nervous
restless
excitable
a
thing
of
twitching
limbs
oh
and
that
not
all
i
will
tell
you
this
morning
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
color
of
his
eyes
had
changed
chayne
stared
at
her
sylvia
he
exclaimed
oh
i
have
not
lost
my
senses
she
answered
and
she
resumed
i
only
noticed
that
there
was
an
alteration
at
first
i
did
not
see
in
what
the
alteration
lay
then
i
saw
his
eyes
used
to
be
light
in
color
this
morning
they
were
dark
i
looked
carefully
to
make
sure
and
so
i
understood
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
were
so
dilated
that
they
covered
the
whole
eyeball
can
you
think
why
and
even
as
she
asked
she
looked
at
that
clenched
hand
of
hers
as
though
the
answer
to
that
question
as
well
lay
hidden
there
i
am
afraid
she
said
once
more
and
upon
that
chayne
committed
the
worst
of
the
many
indiscretions
which
had
signalized
his
courtship
you
are
afraid
sylvia
then
let
me
take
you
away
at
once
sylvia
drew
back
had
chayne
not
spoken
she
would
have
told
him
all
that
there
was
to
tell
she
was
in
the
mood
at
this
unguarded
moment
she
would
have
told
him
that
during
these
last
days
walter
hine
had
taken
to
drink
once
more
she
would
have
opened
that
clenched
fist
and
showed
the
thing
it
hid
even
though
the
thing
condemned
her
father
beyond
all
hope
of
exculpation
but
chayne
had
checked
her
as
surely
as
though
he
had
laid
the
palm
of
his
hand
upon
her
lips
he
would
talk
of
love
and
flight
and
of
neither
had
she
any
wish
to
hear
she
craved
with
a
great
yearning
for
sympathy
and
a
little
kindness
but
chayne
was
not
content
to
offer
what
she
needed
he
would
add
more
and
what
he
added
marred
the
whole
gift
for
sylvia
she
shook
her
head
and
looking
at
him
with
a
sad
and
gentle
smile
said
love
is
for
the
happy
people
that
is
a
hard
saying
sylvia
chayne
returned
and
not
a
true
one
true
to
me
said
sylvia
with
a
deep
conviction
and
as
he
advanced
to
her
she
raised
her
hand
to
keep
him
off
no
no
she
cried
and
had
he
listened
he
might
have
heard
a
hint
of
exasperation
in
her
voice
but
he
would
not
be
warned
you
ca
go
on
living
here
without
sympathy
without
love
without
even
kindness
already
it
is
evident
you
are
ill
and
tired
and
you
think
to
go
on
all
your
life
or
all
your
father
life
sylvia
let
me
take
you
away
and
each
unwise
word
set
him
further
and
further
from
his
aim
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
no
help
anywhere
chayne
in
front
of
her
seemed
to
her
almost
as
much
her
enemy
as
her
father
who
paced
the
lawn
behind
her
arm
in
arm
with
walter
hine
she
clasped
her
hands
together
with
a
quick
sharp
movement
i
will
not
let
you
take
me
away
she
cried
for
i
do
not
love
you
and
her
voice
had
lost
its
gentleness
and
grown
cold
and
hard
chayne
began
again
but
whether
it
was
with
a
renewal
of
his
plea
she
did
not
hear
for
she
broke
in
upon
him
quickly
please
let
me
finish
i
am
as
you
said
a
little
just
hear
me
out
and
leave
me
to
bear
my
troubles
by
myself
you
will
make
it
easier
for
me
she
saw
that
the
words
hurt
her
lover
but
she
did
not
modify
them
she
was
in
the
mood
to
hurt
she
had
been
betrayed
by
her
need
of
sympathy
into
speaking
words
which
she
would
gladly
have
recalled
she
had
been
caught
off
her
guard
and
almost
unawares
and
she
resented
it
chayne
had
told
her
that
she
looked
ill
and
tired
and
she
resented
that
too
no
wonder
she
looked
tired
when
she
had
her
father
with
his
secret
treacheries
on
one
side
and
an
importunate
lover
upon
the
other
she
thought
for
a
moment
or
two
how
best
to
put
what
she
had
still
to
stay
i
have
probably
said
to
you
she
resumed
more
than
was
right
or
fair
i
mean
fair
to
my
father
i
have
no
doubt
exaggerated
things
i
want
you
to
forget
what
i
have
said
for
it
led
you
into
a
mistake
chayne
looked
at
her
in
perplexity
a
mistake
yes
she
answered
she
was
standing
in
front
of
him
with
her
forehead
wrinkled
and
a
somber
angry
look
in
her
eyes
a
mistake
which
i
must
correct
you
said
that
i
was
living
here
without
kindness
it
is
not
true
my
father
is
kind
and
as
chayne
raised
his
eyes
in
a
mute
protest
she
insisted
on
the
word
yes
kind
and
thoughtful
thoughtful
for
others
besides
myself
a
kind
of
obstinacy
forced
her
on
to
enlarge
upon
the
topic
i
can
give
you
an
instance
which
will
surprise
you
there
is
no
need
chayne
said
gently
but
sylvia
was
implacable
but
there
is
need
she
returned
i
beg
you
to
hear
me
when
my
father
and
i
were
at
weymouth
we
drove
one
afternoon
across
the
neck
of
the
chesil
beach
to
portland
chayne
looked
at
sylvia
quickly
yes
he
said
and
there
was
an
indefinable
change
in
his
voice
he
had
consented
to
listen
because
she
wished
it
now
he
listened
with
a
keen
attention
for
a
strange
thought
had
crept
into
his
mind
we
drove
up
the
hill
toward
the
plateau
at
the
top
of
the
island
but
as
we
passed
through
the
village
fortune
well
i
think
they
call
it
my
father
stopped
the
carriage
at
a
tobacconist
and
went
into
the
shop
he
came
out
again
with
some
plugs
of
tobacco
a
good
many
and
got
into
the
carriage
you
wo
guess
why
he
bought
them
i
did
well
said
chayne
and
now
he
spoke
with
suspense
suspense
too
was
visible
in
his
quiet
attitude
there
was
a
mystery
which
for
sake
he
wished
to
unravel
why
did
gabriel
strood
now
call
himself
garratt
skinner
that
was
the
mystery
but
he
must
unravel
it
without
doing
any
hurt
to
sylvia
he
could
not
go
too
warily
of
that
he
had
been
sure
ever
since
kenyon
had
refused
to
speak
of
it
there
might
be
some
hidden
thing
which
for
sylvia
sake
must
not
be
brought
to
light
therefore
he
must
find
out
the
truth
without
help
from
any
one
he
wondered
whether
unconsciously
sylvia
herself
was
going
to
give
him
the
clue
was
she
to
tell
him
what
she
did
not
know
herself
why
gabriel
strood
was
now
garratt
skinner
well
he
repeated
as
we
continued
up
the
hill
she
resumed
my
father
cut
up
the
tobacco
into
small
pieces
with
his
pocket
knife
are
you
doing
that
i
asked
and
he
laughed
and
said
you
will
see
at
the
top
of
the
hill
we
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
walked
across
the
open
plateau
in
front
of
us
rising
high
above
a
little
village
stood
out
a
hideous
white
building
my
father
asked
if
i
knew
what
it
was
i
said
i
guessed
it
was
the
prison
chayne
interrupted
quickly
yes
you
went
to
it
upon
the
answer
to
the
question
depended
whether
or
no
chayne
was
to
unravel
his
mystery
no
replied
sylvia
and
chayne
drew
a
breath
had
she
answered
yes
the
suspicion
which
had
formed
within
his
mind
must
needs
be
set
aside
as
clearly
and
finally
disproved
since
she
answered
no
the
suspicion
gathered
strength
we
went
however
near
to
it
we
went
as
close
to
it
as
the
quarries
it
was
five
in
the
afternoon
and
as
we
came
to
the
corner
of
the
wall
which
surrounds
the
quarries
my
father
said
have
stopped
work
now
he
knew
that
asked
chayne
yes
we
turned
into
a
street
which
runs
down
toward
the
prison
on
one
side
are
small
houses
on
the
other
the
long
wall
of
the
government
quarries
the
street
was
empty
only
now
and
then
very
seldom
some
one
passed
along
it
on
the
top
of
the
wall
there
were
built
at
intervals
for
the
warders
to
overlook
the
convicts
but
these
were
empty
too
the
wall
is
not
high
i
suppose
in
fact
my
father
said
the
quarry
was
deep
on
the
other
side
yes
said
chayne
quietly
and
then
then
we
walked
slowly
along
the
street
and
whenever
there
was
no
one
near
my
father
threw
some
tobacco
over
the
wall
do
suppose
they
have
a
very
enjoyable
time
he
said
will
be
glad
to
find
the
tobacco
there
we
walked
up
the
street
and
turned
and
came
back
and
when
we
reached
the
corner
he
said
with
a
laugh
all
sylvia
my
pockets
are
empty
we
walked
back
to
the
carriage
and
drove
home
again
to
weymouth
sylvia
had
finished
her
story
and
the
mystery
was
clear
to
chayne
she
had
told
him
the
secret
which
she
did
not
know
herself
he
was
sure
now
why
gabriel
strood
had
changed
his
name
he
knew
now
why
gabriel
strood
no
longer
climbed
the
alps
and
why
kenyon
would
answer
no
question
as
to
the
disappearance
of
his
friend
i
have
told
you
this
said
sylvia
because
you
accused
my
father
of
unkindness
and
want
of
thought
would
you
have
thought
of
those
poor
prisoners
over
there
in
the
quarries
if
you
had
would
you
have
taken
so
much
trouble
just
to
give
them
a
small
luxury
i
think
they
must
have
blessed
the
unknown
man
who
thought
for
them
and
showed
them
what
so
many
want
a
little
sympathy
and
a
little
kindness
chayne
bowed
his
head
yes
he
said
gently
i
was
unjust
indeed
even
to
himself
he
acknowledged
that
garratt
skinner
had
shown
an
unexpected
kindness
although
he
was
sure
of
the
reason
for
the
act
he
had
no
doubt
that
garratt
skinner
had
labored
in
those
quarries
himself
and
perhaps
had
himself
picked
up
in
bygone
days
as
he
stooped
over
his
work
tobacco
thrown
over
the
walls
by
some
more
fortunate
man
i
am
glad
you
acknowledge
that
said
sylvia
but
her
voice
did
not
relent
from
its
hostility
she
stood
without
further
word
expecting
him
to
take
his
leave
chayne
recollected
with
how
hopeful
a
spirit
he
had
traveled
down
from
london
his
fine
diplomacy
had
after
all
availed
him
little
he
had
gained
certainly
some
unexpected
knowledge
which
convinced
him
still
more
thoroughly
that
the
sooner
he
took
sylvia
away
from
her
father
and
his
friends
the
better
it
would
be
but
he
was
no
nearer
to
his
desire
it
might
be
that
he
was
further
off
than
ever
you
are
returning
to
london
she
asked
yes
i
have
to
call
at
the
war
office
sylvia
had
no
curiosity
as
to
that
visit
she
took
no
interest
in
it
whatever
he
noticed
with
a
pang
and
then
she
asked
slowly
as
she
crossed
the
hall
with
him
to
the
door
you
will
go
home
chayne
smiled
rather
bitterly
yes
i
suppose
so
into
sussex
yes
she
opened
the
door
and
as
he
came
out
on
to
the
steps
she
looked
at
him
with
a
thoughtful
scrutiny
for
a
few
moments
but
whether
her
thoughts
portended
good
or
ill
for
him
he
could
not
tell
when
i
was
a
boy
he
said
abruptly
i
used
to
see
from
the
garden
of
my
house
far
away
in
a
dip
of
the
downs
a
dark
high
wall
standing
up
against
the
sky
i
never
troubled
myself
as
to
how
it
came
to
have
been
built
there
but
i
used
to
wonder
being
a
boy
whether
it
could
be
scaled
or
no
one
afternoon
i
rode
my
pony
over
to
find
out
and
i
discovered
what
do
you
think
that
my
wall
was
a
mere
hedge
just
three
feet
high
no
more
well
said
sylvia
well
i
have
not
forgotten
that
all
he
replied
she
said
and
he
learned
no
more
from
her
voice
than
he
had
done
from
her
looks
he
walked
away
down
the
lane
and
having
gone
a
few
yards
he
looked
back
sylvia
was
still
standing
in
the
doorway
watching
him
with
grave
and
thoughtful
eyes
but
there
was
no
invitation
to
him
to
return
and
turning
away
again
he
walked
on
sylvia
went
to
her
room
she
unclenched
her
hand
at
last
in
its
palm
there
lay
a
little
phial
containing
a
colorless
solution
but
there
was
a
label
upon
the
phial
and
on
the
label
was
written
cocaine
it
was
that
which
had
struck
at
her
influence
over
walter
hine
it
was
to
introduce
this
drug
that
archie
parminter
had
been
brought
down
from
london
and
the
west
end
clubs
it
drunk
a
good
deal
in
a
quiet
way
archie
had
said
as
he
made
a
pretence
himself
to
drink
it
you
leave
such
drugs
to
the
aristocracy
walter
garratt
skinner
had
chimed
in
just
a
taste
if
you
like
but
go
gently
sylvia
had
not
been
present
but
she
conjectured
the
scene
and
her
conjecture
was
not
far
from
the
truth
but
why
she
asked
and
again
fear
took
hold
of
her
what
was
to
be
gained
there
were
limits
to
knowledge
of
the
under
side
of
life
she
did
not
guess
she
turned
to
her
mirror
and
looked
at
herself
yes
she
looked
tired
she
looked
ill
but
she
was
not
grateful
for
having
the
fact
pointed
out
to
her
and
while
she
still
looked
she
heard
her
father
voice
calling
her
she
shivered
as
though
her
fear
once
more
laid
hold
on
her
then
she
locked
the
bottle
of
cocaine
away
in
a
drawer
and
ran
lightly
down
the
stairs
chapter

both
sides
of
the
question
chayne
house
stood
high
upon
a
slope
of
the
sussex
downs
built
of
stone
two
centuries
ago
it
seemed
gradually
to
have
taken
on
the
brown
color
of
the
hill
behind
it
subduing
itself
to
the
general
scheme
even
as
birds
and
animals
will
do
so
that
strangers
who
searched
for
it
in
the
valley
discovered
it
by
the
upward
swirl
of
smoke
from
its
wide
chimneys
on
its
western
side
and
just
beneath
the
house
there
was
a
cleft
in
the
downs
through
which
the
high
road
ran
and
in
the
cleft
the
houses
of
a
tiny
village
clustered
even
as
at
the
foot
of
some
old
castle
in
picardy
on
the
east
the
great
ridge
with
its
hollows
its
rounded
slopes
of
grass
rolled
away
for
ten
miles
and
then
dipped
suddenly
to
the
banks
of
the
river
arun
the
house
faced
the
south
and
from
its
garden
a
great
stretch
of
park
and
forest
land
was
visible
where
amidst
the
green
and
russet
of
elm
and
beach
a
cluster
of
yews
set
here
and
there
gave
the
illusion
of
a
black
and
empty
space
beyond
the
forest
land
a
lower
ridge
of
hills
rose
up
and
over
that
ridge
one
saw
the
spires
of
chichester
and
the
level
flats
of
selsea
reaching
to
the
sea
into
this
garden
chayne
came
on
the
next
afternoon
and
as
he
walked
along
its
paths
alone
he
could
almost
fancy
that
his
dead
father
paced
with
the
help
of
his
stick
at
his
side
talking
as
had
been
his
wont
of
this
or
that
improvement
needed
by
the
farms
pointing
out
to
him
a
meadow
in
the
hollow
beneath
which
might
soon
be
coming
into
the
market
and
always
ending
up
with
the
same
plea
is
it
time
hilary
that
you
married
and
came
home
to
look
after
it
all
yourself
chayne
had
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
that
plea
but
it
made
its
appeal
to
him
wherever
his
eyes
rested
he
recaptured
something
of
his
boyhood
the
was
alive
with
memories
he
looked
south
and
remembered
how
the
perished
cities
of
history
had
acquired
reality
for
him
by
taking
on
the
aspect
of
chichester
lying
low
there
on
the
flats
and
how
the
spires
of
the
fabled
towns
of
his
storybooks
had
caught
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
just
as
did
now
the
towers
of
the
cathedral
eastward
in
the
dip
between
the
shoulder
of
the
downs
and
the
trees
of
arundel
park
a
long
black
hedge
stood
out
with
a
remarkable
definition
against
the
sky
the
hedge
of
which
he
had
spoken
to
sylvia
the
great
dark
wall
of
brambles
guarding
the
precincts
of
the
sleeping
beauty
he
recalled
the
adventurous
day
when
he
had
first
ridden
alone
upon
his
pony
along
the
great
back
of
the
downs
and
had
come
down
to
it
through
a
sylvan
country
of
silence
and
ferns
and
open
spaces
and
had
discovered
it
to
be
no
more
than
a
hedge
the
dusk
came
upon
him
as
he
loitered
in
that
solitary
garden
the
lights
shone
out
in
cottage
and
and
more
closely
still
his
memories
crowded
about
him
weaving
spells
some
one
to
share
them
with
chayne
had
no
need
to
wait
for
old
age
before
he
learnt
the
wisdom
of
michel
revailloud
for
his
heart
leaped
now
as
he
dreamed
of
exploring
once
more
with
sylvia
at
his
side
the
enchanted
country
of
his
boyhood
gallops
in
the
quiet
summer
mornings
along
that
still
visible
track
across
the
downs
by
which
the
roman
legions
had
marched
in
the
old
days
from
london
straight
as
a
die
to
chichester
winter
days
with
the
hounds
a
rush
on
windy
afternoons
in
a
boat
down
the
arun
to
littlehampton
chayne
heart
leaped
with
a
passionate
longing
as
he
dreamed
and
sank
as
he
turned
again
to
the
blank
windows
of
the
empty
house
he
dined
alone
and
while
he
dined
evoked
sylvia
presence
at
the
table
setting
her
not
at
the
far
end
but
at
the
side
and
close
so
that
a
hand
might
now
and
then
touch
hers
calling
up
into
her
face
her
slow
hesitating
smile
seeing
her
still
gray
eyes
grow
tender
in
a
word
watching
the
madonna
change
into
the
woman
he
went
into
the
library
where
since
the
night
had
grown
chilly
a
fire
was
lit
it
was
a
place
of
comfort
with
high
bookshelves
chairs
and
dark
curtains
but
no
less
than
the
it
needed
another
presence
and
lacking
that
lacked
everything
it
needed
the
girl
with
the
tired
and
face
here
surely
the
fear
would
die
out
of
her
soul
the
eyes
would
lose
their
shadows
the
feet
regain
the
lightness
of
their
step
chayne
took
down
his
favorite
books
but
they
failed
him
between
the
pages
and
his
eyes
one
face
would
shape
itself
he
looked
into
the
fire
and
sought
as
of
old
to
picture
in
the
flames
some
mountain
on
which
his
hopes
were
set
and
to
discover
the
right
line
for
its
ascent
but
even
that
pastime
brought
no
solace
for
his
discontent
the
house
oppressed
him
it
was
empty
it
was
silent
he
drew
aside
the
curtains
and
looking
down
into
the
valley
through
the
clear
night
air
watched
the
lights
in
cottage
and
farm
with
the
envy
born
of
his
loneliness
in
spite
of
the
brave
words
he
had
used
he
wondered
whether
the
hedge
was
not
after
all
to
prove
the
unassailable
wall
and
it
was
important
that
he
should
know
for
if
it
were
so
why
then
he
had
not
called
at
the
war
office
in
vain
a
proposal
had
been
made
to
him
that
he
should
join
a
commission
for
the
delimitation
of
a
distant
frontier
a
year
work
and
an
immediate
departure
those
were
the
conditions
within
two
days
he
must
make
up
his
mind
within
ten
days
he
must
leave
england
chayne
pondered
over
the
decision
which
he
must
make
if
he
had
lost
sylvia
here
was
the
mission
to
accept
for
it
meant
complete
severance
a
separation
not
to
be
measured
by
miles
alone
but
by
the
nature
of
the
work
and
the
comrades
and
even
the
character
of
the
vegetation
he
went
to
bed
in
doubt
thinking
that
the
morning
might
bring
him
counsel
it
brought
him
a
letter
from
sylvia
instead
the
letter
was
long
it
was
written
in
haste
it
was
written
in
great
distress
so
that
words
which
were
rather
unkind
were
written
down
but
the
message
of
the
letter
was
clear
chayne
was
not
to
come
again
to
the
house
of
the
running
water
nor
to
the
little
house
in
london
when
she
returned
to
it
they
were
not
to
meet
again
she
did
not
wish
for
it
chayne
burnt
the
letter
as
soon
as
he
had
read
it
taking
no
offence
at
the
hasty
words
i
seem
to
have
worried
her
more
than
i
thought
he
said
to
himself
with
a
wistful
smile
i
am
sorry
and
again
as
the
sparks
died
out
from
the
black
ashes
of
the
letter
he
repeated
poor
little
girl
i
am
very
sorry
so
the
house
would
always
be
silent
and
empty
sylvia
had
written
the
letter
in
haste
on
the
very
evening
of
visit
and
had
hurried
out
to
post
it
in
fear
lest
she
might
change
her
mind
in
the
morning
but
in
the
morning
she
was
only
aware
of
a
great
lightness
of
spirit
she
could
now
devote
herself
to
the
work
of
her
life
and
for
two
long
tiring
days
she
kept
walter
hine
at
her
side
but
now
he
sought
to
avoid
her
the
little
energy
he
had
ever
had
was
gone
he
alternated
between
exhilaration
and
depression
he
preferred
it
seemed
to
be
alone
for
two
days
however
sylvia
persevered
and
on
the
third
her
lightness
of
spirit
unaccountably
deserted
her
she
drove
with
walter
hine
that
morning
and
something
of
his
own
irritability
seemed
to
have
passed
into
her
so
that
he
turned
to
her
and
asked
what
have
i
done
are
you
pleased
with
me
why
are
you
angry
i
am
not
angry
she
replied
turning
her
great
gray
eyes
upon
him
but
if
you
wish
to
know
i
miss
something
so
much
she
owned
she
missed
something
and
she
knew
very
well
what
it
was
that
she
missed
even
as
chayne
in
his
sussex
home
had
ached
to
know
that
the
house
lacked
a
particular
presence
so
it
began
to
be
with
sylvia
in
dorsetshire
yet
he
has
been
absent
for
a
longer
time
she
argued
with
herself
and
i
have
not
missed
him
indeed
i
have
been
glad
of
his
absence
and
the
answer
came
quickly
from
her
thoughts
at
any
time
you
could
have
called
him
to
your
side
and
you
knew
it
now
you
have
sent
him
away
for
always
during
the
week
the
sense
of
loss
the
feeling
that
everything
was
unbearably
incomplete
grew
stronger
and
stronger
within
her
she
had
no
heart
for
the
losing
battle
in
which
she
was
engaged
a
dangerous
question
began
to
force
itself
forward
in
her
mind
whenever
her
eyes
rested
upon
walter
hine
was
he
worth
while
she
asked
herself
though
as
yet
she
did
not
define
all
that
the
while
connoted
the
question
was
most
prominent
in
her
mind
on
the
seventh
day
after
the
letter
had
been
sent
she
had
persuaded
walter
hine
to
mount
with
her
on
to
the
down
behind
the
house
they
came
to
the
great
white
horse
and
hine
pleading
fatigue
a
plea
which
during
these
last
days
had
been
ever
on
his
lips
flung
himself
down
upon
the
grass
for
a
little
time
sylvia
sat
idly
watching
the
great
battle
ships
at
in
the
bay
it
was
an
afternoon
of
august
a
light
haze
hung
in
the
still
air
softening
the
distant
promontories
and
on
the
waveless
sparkling
sea
the
great
ships
to
the
eye
circled
about
the
targets
with
now
and
then
a
roar
of
thunder
and
a
puff
of
smoke
like
some
monstrous
engines
of
heat
heat
stifling
and
oppressive
by
sheer
contrast
sylvia
began
to
dream
of
the
cool
glaciers
and
the
chalet
de
lognan
suddenly
stood
visible
before
her
eyes
she
watched
the
sunlight
die
off
the
red
rocks
of
the
chardonnet
the
evening
come
with
silent
feet
across
the
snow
and
the
starlit
night
follow
close
upon
its
heels
night
fled
as
she
dreamed
she
saw
the
on
the
aiguille
she
could
almost
hear
the
of
the
axes
as
the
steps
were
cut
and
the
perpetual
hiss
as
the
streamed
down
the
slope
then
she
looked
toward
walter
hine
with
the
speculative
inquiry
which
had
come
so
often
into
her
eyes
of
late
and
as
she
looked
she
saw
him
furtively
take
from
a
pocket
a
tabloid
or
capsule
and
slip
it
secretly
into
his
mouth
how
long
have
you
been
taking
cocaine
she
asked
suddenly
walter
hine
flushed
scarlet
and
turned
to
her
with
a
shrinking
look
i
do
he
stammered
yet
you
left
a
bottle
of
the
drug
where
i
found
it
that
was
not
mine
said
he
still
more
confused
that
was
archie
parminter
he
left
it
behind
yes
said
sylvia
finding
here
a
suspicion
confirmed
but
he
left
it
for
you
and
if
i
did
take
it
said
hine
turning
irritably
to
her
what
can
it
matter
to
you
i
believe
that
what
your
father
says
is
true
what
does
he
say
that
you
care
for
captain
chayne
and
that
it
no
use
for
any
one
else
to
think
of
you
sylvia
started
oh
he
says
that
she
understood
now
one
of
the
methods
of
the
new
intrigue
sylvia
was
in
love
with
chayne
therefore
walter
hine
may
console
himself
with
cocaine
it
was
not
garratt
skinner
who
suggested
it
oh
no
but
archie
parminter
is
invited
for
the
night
takes
the
drug
himself
or
pretends
to
take
it
praises
it
describes
how
the
use
of
it
has
grown
in
the
west
end
and
amongst
the
clubs
and
then
conveniently
leaves
the
drug
behind
and
no
doubt
supplies
it
as
it
is
required
sylvia
began
to
dilate
upon
its
and
suddenly
broke
off
a
great
disgust
was
within
her
and
stopped
her
speech
she
got
to
her
feet
let
us
go
home
she
said
and
she
went
very
quickly
down
the
hill
when
she
came
to
the
house
she
ran
to
her
room
locked
the
door
and
flung
herself
upon
her
bed
walter
hine
her
father
their
plots
and
intrigues
were
swept
clean
from
her
mind
as
of
no
account
her
struggle
for
the
mastery
became
unimportant
in
her
thoughts
a
folly
a
waste
for
what
her
father
had
said
was
true
she
cared
for
chayne
and
what
she
herself
had
said
to
chayne
when
first
he
came
to
the
house
of
the
running
water
was
no
less
true
if
i
loved
i
think
nothing
else
would
count
at
all
except
that
i
loved
she
had
judged
herself
aright
she
knew
that
as
she
lay
prone
upon
her
bed
plunged
in
misery
while
the
birds
called
upon
the
boughs
in
the
garden
and
the
mill
stream
filled
the
room
with
its
leaping
music
in
a
few
minutes
a
servant
knocked
upon
the
door
and
told
her
that
tea
was
ready
in
the
library
but
she
returned
no
answer
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
or
so
it
seemed
but
meanwhile
the
dusk
had
come
there
came
another
knock
and
she
was
told
that
dinner
had
been
served
but
to
that
message
again
she
returned
no
answer
the
noises
of
the
busy
day
ceased
in
the
fields
the
birds
were
hushed
upon
the
branches
quiet
and
darkness
took
and
refreshed
the
world
only
the
throbbing
music
of
the
stream
beat
upon
the
ears
and
beat
with
a
louder
significance
since
all
else
was
still
sylvia
lay
staring
into
the
darkness
to
the
murmur
of
this
music
in
perhaps
this
very
room
she
had
been
born
why
she
asked
piteously
why
of
what
use
was
it
that
she
must
suffer
of
all
the
bad
hours
of
her
life
these
were
the
worst
for
the
yearning
for
happiness
and
love
throbbed
and
cried
at
her
heart
louder
and
louder
just
as
the
music
of
the
stream
swelled
to
importance
with
the
coming
of
the
night
and
she
learned
that
she
had
had
both
love
and
happiness
within
her
grasp
and
that
she
had
thrown
them
away
for
a
shadow
she
thought
of
the
letter
which
she
had
written
recalling
its
phrases
with
a
sinking
heart
no
man
could
forgive
them
i
must
have
been
mad
she
said
and
she
huddled
herself
upon
her
bed
and
wept
aloud
she
ran
over
in
her
mind
the
conversations
which
she
and
hilary
chayne
had
exchanged
and
each
recollection
accused
her
of
impatience
and
paid
a
tribute
to
his
gentleness
on
the
very
first
day
he
had
asked
her
to
go
with
him
and
her
heart
cried
out
now
why
did
i
go
he
had
been
faithful
and
loyal
ever
since
and
she
had
called
his
faithfulness
importunity
and
his
loyalty
a
humiliation
she
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
her
watch
and
by
habit
wound
it
up
and
she
drearily
wondered
on
how
many
many
nights
she
would
have
to
wind
it
up
and
speculate
in
ignorance
what
he
her
lover
was
doing
and
in
what
corner
of
the
world
before
the
end
of
her
days
was
reached
what
would
become
of
her
she
asked
and
she
raised
the
corner
of
a
curtain
and
glanced
at
the
bright
picture
of
what
might
have
been
and
glancing
at
it
the
demand
for
happiness
raised
her
in
revolt
she
lit
her
candle
and
wrote
another
letter
of
the
shortest
it
contained
but
these
few
words
oh
please
forgive
me
come
back
and
forgive
oh
you
must
sylvia
and
having
written
them
sylvia
stole
quietly
let
herself
out
at
the
door
and
posted
them
two
nights
afterward
she
leaned
out
of
her
window
at
midnight
wondering
whether
by
the
morrow
post
she
would
receive
an
answer
to
her
message
and
while
she
wondered
she
understood
that
the
answer
would
not
come
that
way
for
suddenly
in
the
moonlit
road
beneath
her
she
saw
standing
the
one
who
was
to
send
it
chayne
had
brought
his
answer
himself
for
a
moment
she
distrusted
her
own
eyes
believing
that
her
thoughts
had
raised
this
phantom
to
delude
her
but
the
figure
in
the
road
moved
beneath
her
window
and
she
heard
his
voice
call
to
her
sylvia
sylvia
chapter
xix
the
shadow
in
the
room
sylvia
raised
her
hand
suddenly
enjoining
silence
and
turned
back
into
the
room
she
had
heard
a
door
slam
violently
within
the
house
and
now
from
the
hall
voices
rose
her
father
and
walter
hine
were
coming
up
early
from
the
library
and
it
seemed
in
anger
at
all
events
walter
hine
was
angry
his
voice
rang
up
the
stairway
shrill
and
violent
why
do
you
keep
it
from
me
i
will
have
it
i
tell
you
i
am
not
a
child
and
an
oath
or
two
garnished
the
sentences
sylvia
heard
her
father
reply
with
the
patronage
which
never
failed
to
sting
the
vanity
of
his
companion
which
was
the
surest
means
to
provoke
a
quarrel
if
a
quarrel
he
desired
go
to
bed
wallie
leave
such
things
to
archie
parminter
you
are
too
young
his
voice
was
friendly
but
a
little
louder
than
he
generally
used
so
that
sylvia
clearly
distinguished
every
word
so
clearly
indeed
that
had
he
wished
her
to
hear
thus
he
would
have
spoken
she
heard
the
two
men
mount
the
stairs
hine
still
protesting
with
the
violence
which
had
grown
on
him
of
late
garratt
skinner
seeking
apparently
to
calm
him
and
apparently
oblivious
that
every
word
he
spoke
inflamed
walter
hine
the
more
she
had
a
fear
there
would
be
blows
blows
struck
of
course
by
hine
she
knew
the
reason
of
the
quarrel
her
father
was
depriving
hine
of
his
drug
they
passed
however
and
on
the
landing
above
she
heard
their
doors
close
then
coming
back
to
the
window
she
made
a
sign
to
chayne
slipped
a
cloak
about
her
shoulders
and
stole
quietly
down
the
dark
stairs
to
the
door
she
unlocked
the
door
gently
and
went
out
to
her
lover
upon
the
threshold
she
hesitated
chilled
by
a
fear
as
to
how
he
would
greet
her
but
he
turned
to
her
and
in
the
moonlight
she
saw
his
face
and
read
it
there
was
no
anger
there
she
ran
toward
him
oh
my
dear
she
cried
in
a
low
trembling
voice
and
his
arms
enclosed
her
as
she
felt
them
hold
her
to
him
and
knew
indeed
that
it
was
he
her
lover
whose
lips
bent
down
to
hers
there
broke
from
her
a
long
sigh
of
such
relief
and
such
great
uplifting
happiness
as
comes
but
seldom
perhaps
no
more
than
once
in
the
life
of
any
man
or
woman
her
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
and
yet
was
very
clear
and
to
the
man
who
heard
it
sweet
as
never
music
was
oh
my
dear
my
dear
you
have
come
then
and
she
stroked
his
face
and
her
hands
clung
about
his
neck
to
make
very
sure
were
you
afraid
that
i
would
come
sylvia
he
asked
with
a
low
quiet
laugh
she
lifted
her
face
into
the
moonlight
so
that
he
saw
at
once
the
tears
bright
in
her
eyes
and
the
smile
trembling
upon
her
lips
no
she
said
i
rather
thought
that
you
would
come
and
she
laughed
as
she
spoke
or
did
she
sob
he
could
hardly
tell
so
near
she
was
to
both
oh
but
i
could
not
be
sure
i
wrote
with
so
much
unkindness
and
her
eyes
dropped
from
his
in
shame
hush
he
said
and
he
held
her
close
have
you
forgiven
me
oh
please
forgive
me
long
since
said
he
but
sylvia
was
not
reassured
ah
but
you
wo
forget
she
said
ruefully
one
can
forgive
but
one
ca
forget
what
one
forgives
and
then
since
even
in
her
remorse
hope
was
uppermost
with
her
that
night
she
cried
oh
hilary
do
you
think
you
ever
will
forget
what
i
wrote
to
you
and
again
chayne
laughed
quietly
at
her
fears
what
does
it
matter
what
you
wrote
a
week
ago
since
we
are
here
you
and
i
together
in
the
moonlight
for
all
the
world
to
see
that
we
are
lovers
she
drew
him
quickly
aside
into
the
shadow
of
the
wall
are
you
afraid
we
should
be
seen
he
asked
no
but
afraid
we
may
be
interrupted
she
replied
with
a
clear
trill
of
laughter
which
showed
to
her
lover
that
her
fears
had
passed
the
whole
village
is
asleep
sylvia
he
said
in
a
whisper
and
as
he
spoke
a
blind
was
lifted
in
an
upper
story
of
the
house
a
window
was
flung
wide
and
the
light
streamed
out
from
it
into
the
moonlit
air
and
spread
over
their
heads
like
a
great
yellow
fan
walter
hine
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
sill
and
looked
out
sylvia
moved
deeper
into
the
shadow
he
can
not
see
us
said
chayne
with
a
smile
and
he
set
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
so
they
stood
very
quietly
the
house
was
built
a
few
yards
back
from
the
road
and
on
each
side
of
it
the
high
wall
of
the
garden
curved
in
toward
it
making
thus
an
open
graveled
space
in
front
of
its
windows
sylvia
and
her
lover
stood
at
one
of
the
corners
where
the
wall
curved
in
the
shadow
reached
out
beyond
their
feet
and
lay
upon
the
white
road
in
a
black
triangle
they
could
hardly
be
seen
from
any
window
of
the
house
and
certainly
they
could
not
be
recognized
but
on
the
other
hand
they
could
see
from
behind
walter
hine
the
light
streamed
out
clear
the
ceiling
of
the
room
was
visible
and
the
shadow
of
the
lamp
upon
it
and
even
the
top
part
of
the
door
in
the
far
corner
we
will
wait
until
he
turns
back
into
the
room
sylvia
whispered
and
for
a
little
while
they
stood
and
watched
then
she
felt
chayne
arm
tighten
about
her
and
hold
her
still
do
you
see
he
cried
in
a
low
quick
voice
sylvia
do
you
see
what
the
door
look
behind
him
the
door
and
sylvia
looking
as
he
bade
her
started
and
barely
stifled
the
cry
which
rose
to
her
lips
for
behind
walter
hine
the
door
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
was
opening
very
slowly
very
stealthily
as
though
the
hand
which
opened
it
feared
to
be
detected
so
noiselessly
had
the
latch
been
loosed
that
walter
hine
did
not
so
much
as
turn
his
head
nor
did
he
turn
it
now
he
heard
nothing
he
leaned
from
the
window
with
his
elbows
on
the
sill
and
behind
him
the
gap
between
the
door
and
the
wall
grew
wider
and
wider
the
door
opened
into
the
room
and
toward
the
window
so
that
the
two
people
in
the
shadow
below
could
see
nothing
of
the
intruder
but
the
secrecy
of
his
coming
had
something
sinister
and
most
alarming
sylvia
joined
her
hands
above
her
lover
arm
holding
her
breath
shout
to
him
she
whispered
cry
out
that
there
danger
not
yet
said
chayne
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
lighted
room
and
then
in
spite
of
herself
a
low
and
startled
cry
broke
from
lips
a
great
shadow
had
been
suddenly
flung
upon
the
ceiling
of
the
room
the
shadow
of
a
man
bloated
and
made
monstrous
by
the
light
the
intruder
had
entered
the
room
and
with
so
much
stealth
that
his
presence
was
only
noticed
by
the
two
who
watched
in
the
road
below
but
even
they
could
not
see
who
the
intruder
was
they
only
saw
the
shadow
on
the
ceiling
walter
hine
however
heard
sylvia
cry
faint
though
it
was
he
leaned
forward
from
the
window
and
peered
down
now
said
sylvia
now
but
chayne
did
not
answer
he
was
watching
with
an
extraordinary
suspense
he
seemed
not
to
hear
and
on
the
ceiling
the
shadow
moved
and
changed
its
shape
now
dwindling
now
growing
larger
again
now
disappearing
altogether
as
though
the
intruder
stooped
below
the
level
of
the
lamp
and
once
there
was
flung
on
the
white
plaster
the
huge
image
of
an
arm
which
had
something
in
its
hand
was
the
arm
poised
above
the
lamp
on
the
point
of
smashing
it
with
the
thing
it
held
chayne
waited
with
a
cry
upon
his
lips
expecting
each
moment
that
the
room
would
be
plunged
in
darkness
but
the
cry
was
not
uttered
the
arm
was
withdrawn
it
had
not
been
raised
to
smash
the
lamp
the
thing
which
the
hand
held
was
for
some
other
purpose
and
once
more
the
shadow
appeared
moving
and
changing
as
the
intruder
crept
nearer
to
the
window
sylvia
stood
motionless
she
had
thought
to
cry
out
now
she
was
fascinated
a
spell
of
terror
constrained
her
to
silence
and
then
suddenly
behind
walter
hine
there
stood
out
clearly
in
the
light
the
head
and
shoulders
of
garratt
skinner
my
father
said
sylvia
in
relief
her
clasp
upon
chayne
arm
relaxed
her
terror
passed
from
her
in
the
revulsion
of
her
feelings
she
laughed
quietly
at
her
past
fear
chayne
looked
quickly
and
curiously
at
her
then
as
quickly
he
looked
again
to
the
window
both
men
in
the
room
were
now
lit
up
by
the
yellow
light
their
attitudes
their
figures
were
very
clear
but
small
like
marionettes
upon
the
stage
of
some
tiny
theater
chayne
watched
them
with
no
less
suspense
now
that
he
knew
who
the
intruder
was
unlike
sylvia
he
had
betrayed
no
surprise
when
he
had
seen
garratt
skinner
head
and
shoulders
rise
into
view
behind
walter
hine
and
unlike
sylvia
he
did
not
relax
his
vigilance
suddenly
garratt
skinner
stepped
forward
very
quickly
very
silently
with
one
step
he
was
close
behind
his
friend
and
then
just
as
he
was
about
to
move
again
it
seemed
to
sylvia
that
he
was
raising
his
arm
perhaps
to
touch
his
friend
upon
the
shoulder
chayne
whistled
whistled
sharply
shrilly
and
with
a
kind
of
urgency
which
sylvia
did
not
understand
walter
hine
leaned
forward
out
of
the
window
that
was
quite
natural
but
on
the
other
hand
garratt
skinner
did
nothing
of
the
kind
to
surprise
he
stepped
back
and
almost
out
of
sight
very
likely
he
thought
that
he
was
out
of
sight
but
to
the
watchers
in
the
road
his
head
was
just
visible
he
was
peering
over
walter
hine
shoulder
again
chayne
whistled
and
not
content
with
whistling
he
cried
out
in
a
feigned
bucolic
accent
i
see
you
at
once
garratt
skinner
head
disappeared
altogether
walter
hine
peered
down
into
the
darkness
whence
the
whistle
came
curving
his
hands
above
his
forehead
to
shut
out
the
light
behind
him
and
behind
him
once
more
the
shadow
appeared
upon
the
ceiling
and
the
wall
a
third
time
chayne
whistled
and
walter
hine
cried
out
what
is
it
and
behind
him
the
shadow
vanished
from
the
ceiling
and
the
door
began
to
close
softly
and
stealthily
just
as
softly
and
stealthily
as
it
had
been
opened
again
hine
cried
out
who
there
what
is
it
and
chayne
laughed
aloud
derisively
as
though
he
were
some
yokel
practising
a
joke
hine
turned
back
into
the
room
the
room
was
empty
but
the
door
was
unlatched
he
disappeared
from
the
window
and
the
watchers
below
saw
the
door
slammed
to
heard
the
sound
of
the
slamming
and
then
another
sound
the
sound
of
a
key
turning
in
the
lock
it
seemed
almost
that
chayne
had
been
listening
for
that
sound
for
he
turned
at
once
to
sylvia
we
puzzled
them
fairly
did
we
he
said
with
a
smile
but
the
smile
somehow
seemed
hardly
real
and
his
face
was
very
white
it
the
moonlight
he
explained
come
they
walked
quietly
through
the
silent
village
where
the
thick
eaves
of
the
cottages
threw
their
black
shadows
on
the
white
moonlit
road
past
the
mill
and
the
running
water
to
a
gate
which
opened
on
the
down
they
unlatched
the
gate
noiselessly
and
climbed
the
bare
slope
of
grass
half
way
up
chayne
turned
and
looked
down
upon
the
house
there
was
no
longer
any
light
in
any
window
he
turned
to
sylvia
and
slipped
his
arm
through
hers
come
close
said
he
and
now
there
was
no
doubt
the
smile
was
real
shall
we
keep
step
do
you
think
if
we
go
always
like
this
we
might
said
sylvia
with
a
smile
at
times
there
will
be
a
step
to
be
cut
no
doubt
said
he
you
once
said
that
i
could
stand
firm
while
the
step
was
being
cut
she
answered
always
at
the
back
of
both
their
minds
evident
from
time
to
time
in
some
such
phrase
as
this
was
the
thought
of
the
mountain
upon
which
their
friendship
had
been
sealed
friendship
had
become
love
here
in
the
quiet
dorsetshire
village
but
in
both
their
thoughts
it
had
another
background
and
and
the
bright
sun
over
all
chapter
xx
on
the
down
sylvia
led
the
way
to
a
little
hollow
just
beneath
the
ridge
of
the
downs
a
sheltered
spot
open
to
the
sea
on
the
three
other
sides
bushes
grew
about
it
and
dry
branches
and
leaves
deeply
carpeted
the
floor
here
they
rested
and
were
silent
upon
sylvia
troubled
heart
there
had
fallen
a
mantle
of
deep
peace
the
strife
the
fears
the
torturing
questions
had
become
dim
like
the
small
griefs
of
childhood
even
the
incident
of
the
lighted
window
vexed
her
not
at
all
hilary
she
said
softly
lingering
on
the
name
since
to
frame
it
and
utter
it
and
hear
her
lips
speaking
it
greatly
pleased
her
hilary
and
her
hand
sought
his
and
finding
it
she
was
content
it
was
a
warm
night
of
august
overhead
the
moon
sailed
in
a
cloudless
summer
sky
drowning
the
stars
to
the
right
far
below
the
lamps
of
weymouth
curved
about
the
shore
and
in
front
the
great
bay
shimmered
like
a
jewel
seven
miles
across
it
the
massive
bluff
of
portland
pushed
into
the
sea
and
even
those
rugged
cliffs
were
subdued
to
the
beauty
of
the
night
beneath
them
the
shone
steady
upon
the
masts
of
the
battle
ships
sylvia
looked
out
upon
the
scene
with
an
overflowing
heart
often
she
had
gazed
on
it
before
and
she
marveled
now
how
quickly
she
had
turned
aside
her
eyes
were
now
susceptible
to
beauty
as
they
had
never
been
there
was
a
glory
upon
land
and
sea
a
throbbing
tenderness
in
the
warm
air
of
which
she
had
not
known
till
now
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
lived
until
this
night
in
a
prison
once
the
doors
had
been
set
ajar
for
a
little
while
just
for
a
night
and
a
day
in
the
quiet
of
the
high
alps
but
only
now
had
they
been
opened
wide
only
had
she
passed
through
and
looked
forth
with
an
unhindered
vision
upon
the
world
and
she
discovered
it
to
be
a
place
of
wonders
and
sweet
magic
they
were
true
then
she
said
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
of
what
do
you
speak
asked
chayne
my
dreams
sylvia
answered
knowing
that
she
was
justified
of
them
for
i
have
come
awake
into
the
land
of
my
dreams
and
i
know
it
at
last
to
be
a
real
land
even
to
the
sound
of
running
water
for
from
the
hollow
at
her
feet
the
music
of
the
mill
stream
rose
to
her
ears
through
the
still
night
very
clear
and
with
a
murmur
of
laughter
sylvia
looked
down
toward
it
she
saw
it
flashing
like
a
riband
of
silver
in
the
garden
of
the
dark
quiet
house
there
was
no
breath
of
wind
in
that
garden
and
all
the
great
trees
were
still
she
saw
the
intricate
pattern
of
their
boughs
traced
upon
the
lawn
in
black
and
silver
in
that
house
i
was
born
she
said
softly
to
the
noise
of
that
stream
i
am
very
glad
to
know
that
in
that
house
too
my
great
happiness
has
come
to
me
chayne
leaned
forward
and
sitting
side
by
side
with
sylvia
gazed
down
upon
it
with
rapture
oh
wonderful
house
where
sylvia
was
born
how
much
the
world
owed
to
it
it
was
there
he
said
with
awe
yes
replied
sylvia
she
was
not
without
a
proper
opinion
of
herself
and
it
seemed
rather
a
wonderful
house
to
her
too
perhaps
on
some
such
night
as
this
he
said
and
at
once
took
the
words
back
no
you
were
born
on
a
sunny
morning
of
july
and
the
blackbirds
on
the
branches
told
the
good
news
to
the
blackbirds
on
the
lawn
and
the
stream
took
up
the
message
and
rippled
it
out
to
the
ships
upon
the
sea
there
were
no
wrecks
that
day
sylvia
turned
to
him
her
face
made
tender
by
a
smile
her
dark
eyes
kind
and
bright
hilary
she
whispered
oh
hilary
sylvia
he
replied
mimicking
her
tone
and
sylvia
laughed
with
the
clear
melodious
note
of
happiness
all
her
old
life
was
whirled
away
upon
those
notes
of
laughter
she
leaned
to
her
lover
with
a
sigh
of
contentment
her
hair
softly
touching
his
cheek
her
eyes
once
more
dropped
to
the
still
garden
and
the
dark
square
house
at
the
down
foot
there
you
asked
me
to
marry
you
to
go
away
with
you
she
said
and
she
caught
his
hand
and
held
it
close
against
her
breast
yes
there
i
first
asked
you
he
said
and
some
distress
forgotten
in
these
first
perfect
moments
suddenly
found
voice
sylvia
why
you
come
with
me
then
oh
my
dear
if
you
only
had
but
sylvia
happiness
was
as
yet
too
fresh
too
loud
at
her
throbbing
heart
for
her
to
mark
the
jarring
note
i
did
not
want
to
then
she
replied
lightly
and
then
tightening
her
clasp
upon
his
hand
but
now
i
do
oh
hilary
i
do
if
only
you
had
wanted
then
though
he
spoke
low
the
anguish
of
his
voice
was
past
mistaking
sylvia
looked
at
him
quickly
and
most
anxiously
and
as
quickly
she
looked
away
oh
no
she
whispered
hurriedly
her
happiness
could
not
be
so
a
thing
her
heart
stood
still
at
the
thought
it
could
not
be
that
she
had
set
foot
actually
within
the
dreamland
to
be
forthwith
cast
out
again
she
thought
of
the
last
week
its
aching
lonely
hours
she
needed
her
lover
at
her
side
longed
for
him
with
a
great
yearning
and
would
not
let
him
go
i
not
listen
hilary
she
said
stubbornly
i
will
not
hear
no
and
chayne
drew
her
close
to
his
side
there
is
bad
news
sylvia
the
outcry
died
away
upon
her
lips
the
words
crushed
the
rebellion
in
her
heart
they
were
so
familiar
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
her
life
bad
news
had
been
brought
to
her
by
every
messenger
she
shivered
and
was
silent
looking
straight
out
across
the
moonlit
sea
then
in
a
small
trembling
voice
like
a
child
she
pleaded
still
holding
her
face
averted
do
go
away
from
me
hilary
oh
please
do
go
away
from
me
now
her
voice
her
words
went
to
chayne
heart
he
knew
that
pride
and
a
certain
reticence
were
her
natural
qualities
that
she
should
throw
aside
the
one
break
through
the
other
proved
to
him
indeed
how
very
much
she
cared
how
very
much
she
needed
him
sylvia
he
cried
it
will
only
be
for
a
little
while
and
again
silence
followed
upon
his
words
since
bad
news
was
to
be
imparted
strength
was
needed
to
bear
it
and
habit
had
long
since
taught
sylvia
that
silence
was
the
best
nurse
of
strength
she
did
not
turn
her
face
toward
her
lover
but
she
drooped
her
head
and
clenched
her
hands
tightly
together
upon
her
knees
nerving
herself
for
the
blow
the
movement
slight
though
it
was
stirred
chayne
to
pity
and
hurt
him
with
an
intolerable
pain
it
betrayed
so
unmistakably
the
long
habit
of
suffering
she
sat
silent
motionless
with
the
dumb
patience
of
a
wounded
animal
oh
sylvia
why
did
you
not
come
with
me
on
that
first
day
he
cried
tell
me
your
bad
news
dear
she
replied
gently
i
can
not
help
it
he
began
in
broken
tones
sylvia
you
will
see
that
there
is
no
escape
that
i
must
go
an
appointment
was
offered
to
me
by
the
war
office
it
was
offered
to
me
pressed
on
me
the
day
after
i
last
came
here
the
day
after
we
were
together
in
the
library
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
did
not
accept
it
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
each
time
i
came
to
see
you
we
became
more
and
more
estranged
i
was
given
two
days
to
make
up
my
mind
and
within
the
two
days
my
dear
your
letter
came
telling
me
you
did
not
wish
to
see
me
any
more
oh
hilary
she
whispered
i
accepted
the
appointment
at
once
there
were
reasons
why
i
welcomed
it
it
would
take
me
abroad
abroad
she
cried
yes
i
welcomed
that
to
be
near
you
and
not
to
see
you
to
be
near
you
and
know
that
others
were
talking
with
you
any
one
every
one
except
me
to
be
near
you
and
know
that
you
were
unhappy
and
in
trouble
and
that
i
could
not
even
tell
you
how
deeply
i
was
sorry
i
dreaded
that
sylvia
and
yet
i
dreaded
one
thing
more
here
in
england
at
each
turn
of
the
street
i
should
think
to
come
upon
you
suddenly
to
pass
you
as
a
stranger
or
almost
as
a
stranger
no
i
could
not
do
it
oh
hilary
she
whispered
and
lifting
his
hand
she
laid
it
against
her
cheek
so
for
a
week
i
was
glad
but
this
morning
i
received
your
second
letter
sylvia
it
came
too
late
my
dear
there
was
no
time
to
obtain
a
substitute
sylvia
turned
to
him
with
a
startled
face
when
do
you
go
very
soon
when
the
words
had
to
be
spoken
morning
i
catch
the
first
train
from
weymouth
to
southampton
we
sail
from
southampton
at
noon
habit
came
again
to
her
assistance
she
turned
away
from
him
so
that
he
might
not
see
her
face
and
he
went
on
had
there
been
more
time
i
could
have
made
arrangements
some
one
else
could
have
gone
as
it
is
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
bending
toward
her
cried
sylvia
say
that
i
must
go
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
that
she
was
minded
to
hold
with
both
hands
the
good
thing
which
had
come
to
her
this
night
she
shook
her
head
he
sought
to
turn
her
face
to
his
but
she
looked
stubbornly
away
and
when
will
you
return
she
asked
in
a
few
months
sylvia
when
in
june
and
she
counted
off
the
months
upon
her
fingers
so
after
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
shall
not
see
you
any
more
for
all
these
months
the
winter
must
pass
and
the
spring
too
oh
hilary
and
she
turned
to
him
with
a
quivering
face
and
whispered
piteously
do
go
my
dear
do
go
say
that
i
must
go
he
insisted
and
she
laughed
with
scorn
then
the
laughter
ceased
and
she
said
there
will
be
danger
none
he
cried
yes
from
sickness
and
her
voice
broke
in
a
sob
i
shall
not
be
near
i
will
take
great
care
sylvia
be
sure
of
that
he
answered
now
that
i
have
you
i
will
take
great
care
and
leaning
toward
her
as
she
sat
with
her
hands
clasped
upon
her
knees
he
touched
her
hair
with
his
lips
very
tenderly
oh
hilary
what
will
i
do
till
you
come
back
to
me
what
will
i
do
i
have
thought
of
it
sylvia
i
thought
this
it
might
be
better
if
for
these
months
they
will
not
pass
quickly
my
dear
either
for
you
or
me
they
will
be
long
slow
months
for
both
of
us
that
the
truth
my
dear
but
since
they
must
be
got
through
i
thought
it
might
be
better
if
you
went
back
to
your
mother
sylvia
shook
her
head
it
would
be
better
he
urged
with
a
look
toward
the
house
i
ca
do
that
afterward
in
a
year
time
when
we
are
together
i
should
like
very
much
for
us
both
to
go
to
her
but
my
mother
forbade
it
when
i
went
away
from
chamonix
i
was
not
to
come
whining
back
to
her
those
were
her
words
we
parted
altogether
that
night
she
spoke
with
an
extreme
simplicity
there
was
neither
an
appeal
for
pity
nor
a
hint
of
any
bitterness
in
her
voice
but
the
words
moved
chayne
all
the
more
on
that
account
he
would
be
leaving
a
very
lonely
friendless
girl
to
battle
through
the
months
of
his
absence
by
herself
and
to
battle
with
what
he
was
not
sure
but
he
had
not
taken
so
lightly
the
shadow
on
the
ceiling
and
the
opening
door
if
only
you
had
come
with
me
on
that
first
day
he
cried
i
will
have
to
look
back
upon
my
dear
she
said
that
will
be
something
oh
if
i
had
not
asked
you
to
come
back
if
you
had
gone
away
and
said
nothing
what
would
i
have
done
then
as
it
is
i
will
know
that
you
are
thinking
of
me
and
suddenly
she
turned
to
him
and
held
him
away
from
her
in
a
spasm
of
fear
while
her
eyes
searched
his
face
but
in
a
moment
they
melted
and
a
smile
made
her
lips
beautiful
oh
yes
i
can
trust
you
she
said
and
she
nestled
against
him
contentedly
like
a
child
for
a
little
while
they
sat
thus
and
then
her
eyes
sought
the
garden
and
the
house
at
her
feet
it
seemed
that
the
sinister
plot
was
not
after
all
to
develop
in
that
place
of
quiet
and
old
peace
without
her
for
its
witness
it
seemed
that
she
was
to
be
kept
by
some
fatality
to
the
task
the
hopeless
task
which
she
would
now
gladly
have
foregone
and
she
wondered
whether
after
all
she
was
in
some
way
meant
to
watch
the
plot
perhaps
after
all
to
hinder
it
hilary
she
said
you
remember
that
evening
at
the
chalet
de
lognan
do
i
remember
it
you
explained
to
me
a
law
that
those
who
know
must
use
their
knowledge
if
by
using
it
they
can
save
a
soul
or
save
a
life
yes
he
said
vaguely
remembering
that
he
had
spoken
in
this
strain
well
i
have
been
trying
to
obey
that
law
do
you
understand
i
want
you
to
understand
for
when
i
have
been
unkind
as
i
have
been
many
times
it
was
i
think
because
i
was
not
obeying
it
with
very
much
success
and
i
should
like
you
to
believe
and
know
that
for
when
you
are
away
you
will
remember
in
spite
of
yourself
the
times
when
i
was
bitter
her
words
made
clear
to
him
many
things
which
had
perplexed
him
during
these
last
weeks
her
friendship
for
walter
hine
became
intelligible
and
as
though
to
leave
him
no
shadow
of
doubt
she
went
on
you
see
i
knew
the
under
side
of
things
and
i
seemed
to
see
the
opportunity
to
use
the
knowledge
so
i
tried
to
save
and
whether
it
was
life
or
soul
or
both
she
did
not
say
she
did
not
add
that
so
far
she
had
tried
in
vain
she
did
not
mention
the
bottle
of
cocaine
or
the
dread
which
of
late
had
so
oppressed
her
she
was
careful
of
her
lover
since
he
had
to
go
since
he
needs
must
be
absent
she
would
spare
him
anxieties
and
dark
thoughts
which
he
could
do
nothing
to
dispel
but
even
so
he
obtained
a
clearer
insight
into
the
distress
which
she
had
suffered
in
that
house
and
the
bravery
with
which
she
had
borne
it
sylvia
he
said
i
had
no
thought
no
wish
that
what
i
said
should
stay
with
you
yet
it
did
she
answered
and
i
was
thankful
i
am
thankful
even
now
for
though
i
would
gladly
give
up
all
the
struggle
now
if
i
had
you
instead
since
i
have
not
you
i
am
thankful
for
the
law
it
was
your
voice
which
spoke
it
it
came
from
you
it
will
keep
you
near
to
me
all
through
the
black
months
until
you
come
back
oh
hilary
and
the
brave
argument
spoken
to
enhearten
herself
and
him
ended
suddenly
in
a
most
wistful
cry
chayne
caught
her
to
him
oh
sylvia
and
he
added
the
life
is
not
yet
saved
perhaps
i
am
given
to
the
summer
she
answered
and
then
with
a
whimsical
change
of
humor
she
laughed
tenderly
oh
but
i
wish
i
was
you
will
write
letters
will
come
from
you
as
often
as
possible
my
dear
but
they
wo
come
often
let
them
be
long
then
she
whispered
very
long
and
she
leaned
her
head
against
his
shoulder
lie
close
my
dear
said
he
lie
close
for
a
while
longer
they
talked
in
low
voices
to
one
another
the
words
which
lovers
know
and
keep
fragrant
in
their
memories
the
night
warm
and
clear
drew
on
toward
morning
and
the
passage
of
the
hours
was
unremarked
for
both
of
them
there
was
a
glory
upon
the
moonlit
land
and
sea
which
made
of
it
a
new
world
and
into
this
new
world
both
walked
for
the
first
time
walked
in
their
youth
and
hand
in
hand
each
for
the
first
time
knew
the
double
pride
of
loving
and
being
loved
in
spite
of
their
troubles
they
were
not
to
be
pitied
and
they
knew
it
the
gray
morning
light
flooded
the
sky
and
turned
the
moon
into
a
pale
white
disk
lie
close
my
dear
said
he
it
is
not
time
in
the
trees
in
the
garden
below
the
blackbirds
began
to
bustle
amongst
the
leaves
and
all
at
once
their
clear
sweet
music
thrilled
upward
to
the
lovers
in
the
hollow
of
the
down
lie
close
my
dear
he
repeated
they
watched
the
sun
leap
into
the
heavens
and
flash
down
the
channel
in
golden
light
the
night
has
gone
said
chayne
nothing
can
take
it
from
us
while
we
live
answered
sylvia
very
softly
she
raised
herself
from
her
couch
of
leaves
then
from
one
of
the
cottages
in
the
tiny
village
a
blue
coil
of
smoke
rose
into
the
air
it
is
time
said
chayne
and
they
rose
and
hand
in
hand
walked
down
the
slope
of
the
hill
to
the
house
sylvia
unlatched
the
door
noiselessly
and
went
in
chayne
stepped
in
after
her
and
in
the
silent
hall
they
took
farewell
of
one
another
my
dear
she
whispered
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
voice
and
she
clung
to
him
a
little
and
so
let
him
go
she
held
the
door
ajar
until
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
had
died
away
and
after
that
for
she
fancied
that
she
heard
them
still
since
she
so
deeply
wished
to
hear
them
then
with
a
breaking
heart
she
went
up
the
stairs
to
her
room
chapter
xxi
chayne
comes
to
conclusions
six
weeks
ago
i
said
to
the
french
commission
on
the
borders
of
a
great
lake
in
africa
a
month
ago
i
was
still
walking
to
the
rail
head
through
the
tangle
of
a
forest
undergrowth
said
chayne
and
he
looked
about
the
little
restaurant
in
king
street
james
as
though
to
make
sure
that
the
words
he
spoke
were
true
the
bright
lights
the
red
benches
against
the
walls
the
women
in
their
delicate
gowns
of
lace
and
the
jingle
of
harness
in
the
streets
without
made
their
appeal
to
one
who
for
the
best
part
of
a
year
had
lived
within
the
dark
walls
of
a
forest
june
had
come
round
again
and
sylvia
sat
at
his
side
you
shall
tell
me
how
these
months
have
gone
with
you
while
we
dine
said
he
your
letters
told
me
nothing
of
your
troubles
i
did
not
mean
them
to
replied
sylvia
i
guessed
that
my
dear
it
was
like
you
yet
i
would
rather
have
known
only
a
few
hours
before
he
had
stood
upon
the
deck
of
the
channel
packet
and
had
seen
the
bows
swing
westward
of
dover
castle
and
head
toward
the
pier
would
sylvia
be
there
he
had
wondered
as
he
watched
the
cluster
of
atoms
on
the
quay
and
in
a
little
while
he
had
seen
her
standing
quite
alone
at
the
very
end
of
the
breakwater
that
she
might
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
her
lover
others
had
traveled
with
them
in
the
carriage
to
london
and
there
had
been
no
opportunity
of
speech
all
that
he
knew
was
that
she
had
been
alone
now
for
some
weeks
in
the
little
house
in
hobart
place
one
thing
i
see
he
said
you
are
not
as
troubled
as
you
were
the
look
of
fear
that
has
gone
from
your
eyes
sylvia
i
am
glad
there
were
times
she
answered
and
as
she
thought
upon
them
terror
once
more
leapt
into
her
face
times
when
i
feared
more
than
ever
when
i
needed
you
very
much
but
they
are
past
now
hilary
and
her
hand
dropped
for
a
moment
upon
his
and
her
eyes
brightened
with
a
smile
as
they
dined
she
told
the
story
of
those
months
we
returned
to
london
very
suddenly
after
you
had
gone
away
she
began
we
were
to
have
stayed
through
september
but
my
father
said
that
business
called
him
back
and
i
noticed
that
he
was
deeply
troubled
when
did
you
notice
that
asked
chayne
quickly
when
did
you
first
notice
it
sylvia
reflected
for
a
moment
the
day
after
you
had
gone
are
you
sure
asked
chayne
with
a
certain
intensity
quite
chayne
nodded
his
head
i
did
not
understand
the
reason
of
the
hurry
and
i
was
perplexed
and
also
a
little
alarmed
everything
which
i
did
not
understand
frightened
me
in
those
days
she
spoke
as
if
those
days
and
all
their
dark
events
belonged
to
some
dim
period
of
which
no
consequence
could
reach
her
now
our
departure
had
almost
the
look
of
a
flight
yes
said
chayne
for
his
part
he
was
not
surprised
at
their
flight
he
had
passed
more
than
one
wakeful
night
during
the
last
few
months
arguing
and
arguing
again
whether
or
no
he
should
have
disclosed
to
sylvia
the
meaning
of
that
softly
opening
door
and
the
shadow
on
the
ceiling
as
he
read
it
he
might
have
been
wrong
if
so
he
would
have
added
to
burden
of
troubles
yet
another
and
one
more
terrible
than
all
the
rest
he
might
have
been
right
and
if
so
he
might
have
enabled
sylvia
to
avert
a
tragedy
thus
the
argument
had
revolved
in
a
circle
and
left
him
always
in
the
same
doubt
now
he
understood
that
his
explanation
of
the
incident
had
been
confirmed
the
loud
whistle
from
the
darkness
of
the
road
the
yokel
cry
which
had
driven
garratt
skinner
from
the
room
as
noiselessly
as
he
had
entered
it
had
done
more
than
that
they
had
driven
him
from
the
neighborhood
altogether
some
one
had
seen
him
had
seen
him
standing
just
behind
walter
hine
in
the
lighted
room
and
on
the
next
day
he
had
fled
i
was
right
he
said
absently
right
to
keep
silent
for
here
was
sylvia
at
his
side
and
the
dreaded
peril
unfulfilled
well
you
returned
to
london
he
added
hastily
yes
there
is
something
of
which
i
did
not
tell
you
that
night
when
we
were
together
on
the
downs
walter
hine
had
begun
to
take
cocaine
chayne
started
cocaine
he
cried
yes
my
father
taught
him
to
take
it
your
father
said
chayne
slowly
trying
to
fit
this
new
and
astounding
fact
in
with
the
rest
but
why
i
think
i
can
tell
you
said
sylvia
my
father
knew
quite
well
that
he
had
me
working
against
him
trying
to
rescue
walter
hine
out
of
his
hands
and
i
was
beginning
to
get
some
power
he
understood
that
and
destroyed
it
i
was
no
match
for
him
i
thought
that
i
knew
something
of
the
under
side
of
life
but
he
knew
more
ever
so
much
more
and
my
knowledge
was
of
no
avail
he
taught
walter
hine
the
craving
for
cocaine
and
he
satisfied
the
craving
there
was
his
power
he
provided
the
drug
i
do
not
know
i
might
perhaps
have
fought
against
my
father
and
won
but
against
my
father
and
a
drug
i
was
helpless
my
father
obtained
it
in
sufficient
quantity
withheld
it
at
times
gave
it
at
other
times
played
with
him
tantalized
him
gratified
him
you
can
understand
there
was
only
one
possible
result
walter
hine
became
my
father
slave
his
dog
i
no
longer
counted
in
his
thoughts
at
all
i
was
nothing
yes
said
chayne
the
device
was
subtle
diabolically
subtle
but
he
wondered
whether
it
was
only
to
counterbalance
and
destroy
sylvia
influence
that
garratt
skinner
had
introduced
cocaine
to
hine
notice
whether
he
had
not
had
in
view
some
other
end
even
still
more
sinister
i
saw
very
little
of
hine
after
our
return
to
london
she
continued
he
did
not
come
often
to
the
house
but
when
he
did
come
each
time
i
saw
that
he
had
changed
he
had
grown
nervous
and
violent
of
temper
even
before
we
left
dorsetshire
the
violence
had
become
noticeable
oh
said
chayne
looking
quickly
at
sylvia
before
you
left
dorsetshire
yes
and
my
father
seemed
to
me
to
provoke
it
though
i
could
not
guess
why
for
instance
yes
said
chayne
tell
me
he
spoke
quietly
enough
but
once
again
there
was
audible
a
certain
intensity
in
his
voice
there
had
been
an
occasion
when
sylvia
had
given
to
him
more
news
of
garratt
skinner
than
she
had
herself
was
she
to
do
so
once
more
he
leaned
forward
with
his
eyes
on
hers
the
night
when
you
came
back
to
me
do
you
remember
hilary
and
a
smile
lightened
his
face
i
shall
forget
no
moment
of
that
night
sweetheart
while
i
live
he
whispered
and
blushes
swept
prettily
over
her
face
and
in
a
sweet
confusion
she
smiled
back
at
him
oh
hilary
she
said
oh
sylvia
he
mimicked
and
as
they
laughed
together
it
seemed
there
was
a
danger
that
the
story
of
the
months
of
separation
would
never
be
completed
but
chayne
brought
her
back
to
it
well
on
that
night
when
i
came
back
i
saw
you
in
the
road
from
my
window
and
then
motioning
you
to
be
silent
i
disappeared
from
the
window
yes
i
remember
said
chayne
eagerly
he
began
to
think
that
the
cocaine
was
after
all
going
to
fit
in
with
the
incidents
of
that
night
walter
hine
and
my
father
were
going
up
to
bed
i
heard
them
on
the
stairs
they
were
going
earlier
than
usual
you
are
sure
interrupted
chayne
think
well
much
earlier
than
usual
and
they
were
quarreling
at
least
walter
hine
was
quarreling
and
my
father
was
speaking
to
him
as
if
he
were
a
child
that
hurt
his
vanity
and
made
him
worse
your
father
was
provoking
him
sylvia
forehead
puckered
i
could
not
say
that
and
be
sure
of
it
but
i
can
say
this
if
my
father
had
wished
to
provoke
him
to
a
greater
anger
it
in
that
way
that
he
would
have
done
it
yes
i
see
they
were
speaking
loudly
even
my
father
was
more
loudly
than
usual
especially
at
that
time
for
when
they
went
they
usually
went
very
quietly
and
again
chayne
interrupted
her
your
father
might
have
wanted
you
to
hear
the
quarrel
he
suggested
sylvia
turned
to
him
curiously
why
should
he
wish
that
she
asked
and
considered
the
point
he
might
have
only
on
the
other
hand
they
were
earlier
than
usual
they
would
not
be
so
careful
to
go
quietly
i
was
likely
to
be
still
awake
exactly
said
chayne
for
in
the
probability
that
sylvia
would
be
still
awake
would
hear
the
violent
words
of
hine
and
would
therefore
be
an
available
witness
afterward
chayne
found
the
reason
both
of
the
loudness
of
garratt
skinner
tones
and
his
early
retirement
for
the
night
did
you
hear
what
was
said
can
you
repeat
the
words
he
asked
yes
my
father
was
keeping
something
from
hine
which
he
wanted
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
the
cocaine
and
she
repeated
the
words
yes
said
chayne
yes
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
satisfied
the
incident
of
the
lighted
room
and
the
shadow
on
the
ceiling
were
clear
to
him
now
a
quarrel
of
which
there
was
a
witness
a
quarrel
all
to
the
credit
of
garratt
skinner
since
it
arose
from
his
determination
to
hinder
walter
hine
from
poisoning
himself
with
drugs
at
least
that
is
how
the
evidence
would
work
out
the
quarrel
continued
in
walter
hine
bedroom
whither
garratt
skinner
had
accompanied
his
visitor
a
struggle
begun
for
the
possession
of
the
drug
begun
by
a
man
half
crazy
for
want
of
it
a
blow
in
delivered
by
garratt
skinner
perhaps
a
fall
from
the
window
that
is
how
chayne
read
the
story
of
that
night
as
fashioned
by
the
ingenuity
of
garratt
skinner
but
on
one
point
he
was
still
perplexed
the
story
had
not
been
told
out
to
its
end
that
night
there
had
come
an
unexpected
shout
which
had
interrupted
it
and
indeed
forever
had
prevented
its
completion
on
that
spot
but
why
had
it
not
been
completed
afterward
during
the
next
few
months
somewhere
else
it
had
not
been
completed
for
here
was
sylvia
with
all
her
fears
allayed
continuing
the
story
of
those
months
but
violence
was
not
the
only
change
in
walter
hine
there
were
some
physical
alterations
which
frightened
me
hine
as
i
say
came
very
seldom
to
our
house
though
my
father
saw
a
great
deal
of
him
otherwise
i
should
have
noticed
them
before
but
early
this
year
he
came
and
you
remember
he
was
fair
well
his
skin
had
grown
dark
quite
dark
his
complexion
had
changed
altogether
and
there
was
something
else
which
shocked
me
his
tongue
was
black
really
black
i
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
he
grew
restless
and
angry
and
lied
to
me
and
then
he
broke
down
and
told
me
he
could
not
sleep
he
slept
for
a
few
minutes
only
at
a
time
he
really
was
ill
very
was
this
the
explanation
chayne
asked
himself
having
failed
at
the
quick
process
the
process
of
the
lighted
room
and
the
open
window
had
garratt
skinner
left
the
drug
to
do
its
work
slowly
and
surely
he
was
so
weak
so
broken
in
appearance
that
i
was
alarmed
my
father
was
not
in
the
house
i
sent
for
a
cab
and
i
took
hine
myself
to
a
doctor
the
doctor
knew
at
once
what
was
amiss
for
a
time
hine
said
but
he
gave
in
at
the
last
he
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
thirty
grains
of
cocaine
a
day
thirty
grains
exclaimed
chayne
yes
of
course
it
could
not
go
on
death
or
insanity
would
surely
follow
he
was
warned
of
it
and
for
a
while
he
went
into
a
home
then
he
got
better
and
he
determined
to
go
abroad
and
travel
who
suggested
that
asked
chayne
i
do
not
know
i
know
only
that
he
refused
to
go
without
my
father
and
that
my
father
consented
to
accompany
him
chayne
was
startled
they
are
away
together
now
he
cried
a
look
of
horror
in
his
eyes
betrayed
his
fear
he
stared
at
sylvia
had
she
no
suspicion
she
who
knew
something
of
the
under
side
of
life
but
she
quietly
returned
his
look
i
took
precautions
i
told
my
father
what
i
knew
not
merely
that
hine
had
acquired
the
habit
of
taking
cocaine
but
who
had
taught
him
the
habit
yes
i
did
that
she
said
simply
answering
his
look
of
astonishment
it
was
difficult
my
dear
and
i
would
very
much
have
liked
to
have
had
you
there
to
help
me
through
with
it
but
since
you
were
not
there
since
i
was
alone
i
did
it
alone
i
thought
of
you
hilary
while
i
was
saying
what
i
had
to
say
i
tried
to
hear
your
voice
speaking
again
outside
the
chalet
de
lognan
you
know
that
you
must
do
i
warned
my
father
that
if
any
harm
came
to
walter
hine
from
taking
the
drug
again
any
harm
at
all
which
i
traced
to
my
father
i
would
not
keep
silent
chayne
leaned
back
in
his
seat
you
said
that
to
garratt
skinner
sylvia
and
the
warmth
of
pride
and
admiration
in
his
voice
brought
the
color
to
her
cheeks
and
compensated
her
for
that
bad
hour
you
stood
up
alone
and
braved
him
out
my
dear
if
i
had
only
been
there
and
you
never
wrote
to
me
a
word
of
it
it
would
only
have
troubled
you
she
answered
it
would
not
have
helped
me
to
know
that
you
were
troubled
and
he
your
father
he
asked
how
did
he
receive
it
sylvia
face
grew
pale
and
she
stared
at
the
as
though
she
could
not
for
the
moment
trust
her
voice
then
she
shuddered
and
said
in
a
low
and
shaking
voice
so
vivid
was
still
the
memory
of
that
hour
i
thought
that
i
should
never
see
you
again
she
said
no
more
from
those
few
words
and
from
the
manner
in
which
she
uttered
them
chayne
had
to
build
up
the
terrible
scene
which
had
taken
place
between
sylvia
and
her
father
in
the
little
back
room
of
the
house
in
hobart
place
he
looked
round
the
lighted
room
listened
to
the
ripple
of
light
voices
and
watched
the
play
of
lively
faces
and
bright
eyes
there
was
an
incongruity
between
these
surroundings
and
the
words
which
he
had
heard
which
shocked
him
my
dear
i
make
it
up
to
you
he
said
trust
me
i
will
there
shall
be
good
hours
now
i
watch
you
till
i
know
surely
without
a
word
from
you
what
you
are
thinking
and
feeling
and
wanting
trust
me
dearest
with
all
my
heart
and
the
rest
of
my
life
she
answered
a
smile
responding
to
his
words
and
she
resumed
her
story
i
extracted
from
my
father
a
promise
that
every
week
he
should
write
to
me
and
tell
me
how
hine
was
and
where
they
both
were
and
to
that
at
last
he
consented
they
have
been
away
together
for
two
months
and
every
week
i
have
heard
so
i
think
there
is
no
danger
chayne
did
not
disagree
but
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
assent
i
suppose
hine
is
very
rich
he
said
doubtfully
no
replied
sylvia
that
another
reason
why
i
am
not
afraid
she
chose
the
words
rather
carefully
unwilling
to
express
a
deliberate
charge
against
her
father
i
used
to
think
that
he
was
in
the
beginning
when
captain
barstow
won
so
much
from
him
but
when
the
bets
ceased
and
no
more
cards
were
played
i
used
to
puzzle
over
why
they
ceased
last
year
but
i
think
i
have
hit
upon
the
explanation
my
father
discovered
then
what
i
only
found
out
a
few
weeks
ago
i
wrote
to
hine
grandfather
telling
him
that
his
grandson
was
ill
and
asking
him
whether
he
would
not
send
for
him
i
thought
that
would
be
the
best
plan
yes
well
well
the
grandfather
answered
me
very
shortly
that
he
did
not
know
his
grandson
that
he
did
not
wish
to
know
him
and
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
in
any
way
it
was
a
churlish
letter
he
seemed
to
think
that
i
wanted
to
marry
hine
and
she
laughed
as
she
spoke
and
that
i
was
trying
to
find
out
what
we
should
have
to
live
upon
i
suppose
that
it
was
natural
he
should
think
so
and
i
am
so
glad
that
i
wrote
for
he
told
me
that
although
hine
must
eventually
have
a
fortune
it
would
not
be
until
he
himself
died
and
that
he
was
a
very
healthy
man
so
you
see
there
could
be
no
advantage
to
any
one
and
she
did
not
finish
the
sentence
but
chayne
could
finish
it
for
himself
there
could
be
no
advantage
to
any
one
if
walter
hine
died
but
then
why
the
cocaine
why
the
incident
of
the
lighted
window
yes
he
said
in
perplexity
i
can
corroborate
that
it
happened
that
my
friend
john
lattery
who
was
killed
in
switzerland
was
also
connected
with
joseph
hine
he
also
would
have
inherited
and
i
knew
from
him
that
the
old
man
did
not
recognize
his
heirs
but
but
walter
hine
had
money
some
money
at
all
events
and
he
earned
none
from
whom
did
he
get
it
sylvia
shook
her
head
i
do
not
know
had
he
no
other
relations
no
friends
none
who
would
have
made
him
an
allowance
chayne
pondered
over
that
question
for
in
the
answer
to
it
he
was
convinced
he
would
find
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
if
money
was
given
to
walter
hine
who
had
apparently
no
rich
relations
but
his
grandfather
and
certainly
no
rich
friends
it
would
have
been
given
with
some
object
to
discover
the
giver
and
his
object
that
was
the
problem
think
did
he
never
speak
of
any
one
sylvia
searched
her
memories
no
she
said
he
never
spoke
of
his
private
affairs
he
always
led
us
to
understand
that
he
drew
an
allowance
from
his
grandfather
but
your
father
found
that
that
was
untrue
when
you
were
in
dorsetshire
ten
months
ago
for
the
and
the
bets
ceased
yes
sylvia
agreed
thoughtfully
then
her
face
brightened
i
remember
a
morning
when
hine
was
in
trouble
wait
a
moment
he
had
a
letter
we
were
at
breakfast
and
the
letter
came
from
captain
barstow
there
was
some
phrase
in
the
letter
which
hine
repeated
between
gentlemen
that
was
it
i
remember
thinking
at
the
time
what
in
the
world
captain
barstow
could
know
about
gentlemen
and
wondering
why
the
phrase
should
trouble
hine
and
that
morning
hine
went
to
london
oh
did
he
cried
chayne
between
gentlemen
had
hine
been
losing
money
lately
to
captain
barstow
yes
on
the
day
when
you
first
came
the
starlings
exclaimed
chayne
in
some
excitement
that
it
walter
hine
owes
money
to
captain
barstow
which
he
ca
pay
barstow
writes
for
it
a
debt
of
honor
between
gentlemen
one
can
imagine
the
letter
hine
goes
up
to
london
well
what
then
sylvia
started
my
father
went
to
london
two
days
afterward
are
you
sure
it
seemed
to
chayne
that
they
were
getting
hot
in
their
search
quite
sure
for
i
remember
that
after
his
return
his
manner
changed
what
i
thought
to
be
the
new
plot
was
begun
the
cards
disappeared
the
bets
ceased
parminter
was
brought
down
with
the
cocaine
i
remember
it
all
clearly
for
i
always
associated
the
change
with
my
journey
to
london
you
came
one
evening
do
you
remember
you
found
me
alone
and
afraid
my
father
and
walter
hine
were
walking
in
the
garden
that
was
afterward
yes
you
were
afraid
because
there
was
no
sincerity
in
that
friendship
now
let
me
get
this
right
he
remained
silent
for
a
little
while
placing
the
events
in
their
due
order
and
interpreting
them
one
by
the
other
this
is
what
i
make
of
it
he
said
at
length
the
man
in
london
who
supplies
walter
hine
with
money
finds
that
walter
hine
is
spending
too
much
he
therefore
puts
himself
into
communication
with
garratt
skinner
of
whom
he
has
doubtless
heard
from
walter
hine
garratt
skinner
travels
to
london
has
an
interview
and
a
concerted
plan
of
action
is
agreed
upon
which
garratt
skinner
proceeds
to
put
in
action
he
spoke
so
gravely
that
sylvia
turned
anxiously
toward
him
what
do
you
infer
then
she
asked
that
we
are
in
very
deep
and
troubled
waters
my
dear
he
replied
but
he
would
not
be
more
explicit
he
had
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
the
murder
of
walter
hine
had
been
deliberately
agreed
upon
by
garratt
skinner
and
the
unknown
man
in
london
but
just
as
sylvia
had
spared
him
during
his
months
of
absence
so
now
he
was
minded
to
spare
sylvia
only
in
order
that
he
might
spare
her
in
order
that
he
might
prevent
shame
and
distress
greater
than
she
had
known
he
must
needs
go
on
with
his
questioning
he
must
discover
if
by
any
means
he
could
the
identity
of
the
unknown
man
who
was
so
concerned
in
the
destiny
of
walter
hine
of
your
father
friends
was
there
one
who
was
rich
who
came
to
the
house
who
were
his
companions
very
few
people
came
to
the
house
there
was
no
one
amongst
them
who
fits
in
and
upon
that
she
started
i
wonder
she
said
thoughtfully
and
she
turned
to
her
lover
after
my
father
had
gone
away
i
found
a
telegram
in
a
drawer
in
one
of
the
rooms
there
was
no
envelope
there
was
just
the
telegram
so
i
opened
it
it
was
addressed
to
my
father
i
remember
the
words
for
i
did
not
know
whether
there
was
not
something
which
needed
attention
it
ran
like
this
are
you
waiting
for
hurry
up
was
it
signed
asked
chayne
yes
replied
sylvia
jarvice
chayne
repeated
and
he
spoke
it
yet
again
as
though
in
some
vague
way
it
was
familiar
to
him
what
was
the
date
of
the
telegram
it
had
been
sent
a
month
before
i
found
it
so
i
put
it
back
into
the
drawer
are
you
waiting
for
hurry
up
jarvice
said
chayne
slowly
and
then
he
remembered
how
and
when
he
had
come
across
the
name
of
jarvice
before
his
face
grew
very
grave
we
are
in
deep
waters
my
dear
he
said
there
had
been
trouble
in
his
regiment
some
years
before
in
which
the
chief
figures
had
been
a
subaltern
and
a
jarvice
was
the
name
of
the
an
unusual
name
just
such
a
man
would
be
likely
to
be
garratt
skinner
confederate
and
backer
chayne
ran
over
the
story
in
his
mind
again
by
this
new
light
it
certainly
strengthened
the
argument
that
the
jarvice
who
sent
the
telegram
was
jarvice
the
thus
did
chayne
work
it
out
in
his
thoughts
jarvice
for
some
reason
unknown
pays
walter
hine
an
allowance
walter
hine
gives
it
out
that
he
receives
it
from
his
grandfather
whose
heir
he
undoubtedly
is
and
being
a
vain
person
much
exaggerates
the
amount
he
falls
into
garratt
skinner
hands
who
with
the
help
of
barstow
and
others
proceeds
to
pluck
him
walter
hine
loses
more
than
he
has
and
applies
to
jarvice
for
more
jarvice
elicits
the
facts
and
instead
of
disclosing
who
garratt
skinner
is
and
the
obvious
swindle
of
which
hine
is
the
victim
takes
garratt
skinner
into
his
confidence
what
happened
at
the
interview
between
jarvice
and
garratt
skinner
in
london
the
subsequent
facts
make
plain
at
jarvice
instigation
the
plot
to
swindle
walter
hine
becomes
a
plan
to
murder
him
that
plan
has
been
twice
frustrated
once
by
me
in
dorsetshire
and
a
second
time
by
sylvia
so
far
the
story
worked
out
naturally
logically
but
there
remained
two
questions
for
what
reason
did
jarvice
make
walter
hine
an
allowance
and
how
would
walter
hine
death
profit
him
chayne
pondered
over
those
two
questions
and
then
the
truth
flashed
upon
him
he
remembered
how
the
subaltern
had
been
extracted
from
his
difficulties
money
had
been
raised
by
a
life
insurance
again
chayne
ranged
his
facts
in
order
walter
hine
is
the
heir
to
great
wealth
but
he
has
no
money
now
jarvice
makes
him
an
allowance
the
money
to
be
repaid
with
a
handsome
interest
on
the
grandfather
death
but
in
order
to
insure
jarvice
from
loss
if
walter
hine
should
die
first
walter
hine
life
is
insured
for
a
large
sum
thus
jarvice
makes
his
position
tenable
should
his
conduct
be
called
in
question
having
insured
walter
life
he
arranges
with
garratt
skinner
to
murder
him
the
attempt
failed
the
first
time
the
slower
method
is
then
adopted
by
garratt
skinner
and
as
a
result
comes
the
impatient
telegram
are
you
waiting
for
hurry
up
the
case
was
thus
so
far
clear
but
anxiety
remained
was
the
plan
abandoned
altogether
now
that
sylvia
had
stood
bravely
up
and
warned
her
father
that
she
would
not
keep
silent
so
certainly
sylvia
thought
but
then
she
did
not
know
all
that
chayne
knew
it
seemed
that
she
had
not
understood
the
incident
of
the
lighted
window
nor
was
chayne
surprised
for
she
was
unaware
of
what
was
in
chayne
eyes
the
keystone
of
the
whole
argument
she
did
not
know
that
her
father
had
worked
as
a
convict
in
the
portland
quarries
so
they
are
abroad
together
your
father
and
walter
hine
said
chayne
slowly
yes
replied
sylvia
with
a
smile
guess
where
they
are
now
and
she
turned
to
him
with
a
tender
look
upon
her
face
which
he
did
not
understand
i
ca
guess
at
chamonix
she
saw
her
lover
flinch
his
face
grow
white
his
eyes
stare
in
horror
and
she
wondered
for
her
the
little
town
overtopped
by
its
tumbled
glittering
fields
of
snow
and
tall
rock
spires
was
a
place
apart
she
cherished
it
in
her
memories
keeping
clear
and
distinct
the
windings
of
its
streets
where
they
narrowed
where
they
broadened
into
open
spaces
yet
all
the
while
her
thoughts
transformed
it
and
made
of
its
mere
stones
and
bricks
a
tiny
city
magical
with
light
and
grace
for
while
she
stayed
in
it
her
happiness
had
dawned
and
she
saw
it
always
roseate
with
that
dawn
it
seemed
to
her
that
plots
and
thoughts
of
harm
could
there
hardly
outlive
one
starlit
night
one
sunlit
day
had
she
mapped
out
her
father
itinerary
thither
and
nowhere
else
would
she
have
sent
him
you
are
afraid
she
asked
hilary
why
chayne
did
not
answer
her
question
he
was
minded
to
spare
her
even
as
she
had
spared
him
he
talked
of
other
things
until
the
restaurant
grew
empty
and
the
waiters
began
to
turn
out
the
lights
as
a
hint
to
these
two
determined
loiterers
then
in
the
darkness
for
now
there
was
but
one
light
left
and
that
at
a
little
distance
from
their
table
chayne
leaned
forward
and
turning
to
sylvia
as
they
sat
side
by
side
you
have
been
happy
very
she
answered
and
there
was
a
thrill
of
joyousness
in
her
clear
low
voice
as
though
her
heart
sang
within
her
her
eyes
rested
on
his
with
pride
no
man
could
quite
understand
she
said
well
then
why
should
we
wait
longer
sylvia
he
said
we
have
waited
long
enough
my
dear
we
have
after
all
no
one
but
ourselves
to
please
i
should
like
our
marriage
to
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
sylvia
answered
him
without
affectation
i
too
she
whispered
then
i
get
a
special
license
morning
and
make
the
arrangements
we
can
go
away
together
at
once
sylvia
smiled
and
the
smile
deepened
into
a
laugh
where
shall
we
go
hilary
she
cried
to
some
perfect
place
to
chamonix
he
answered
that
was
where
we
first
met
there
could
be
no
better
place
we
can
just
go
and
tell
your
father
what
we
have
done
and
then
go
up
into
the
hills
it
was
well
done
he
spoke
without
wakening
sylvia
suspicions
she
had
never
understood
the
episode
of
the
lighted
window
she
did
not
know
that
her
father
was
gabriel
strood
of
whose
exploits
in
the
alps
she
had
read
she
believed
that
all
danger
to
walter
hine
was
past
chayne
on
the
other
hand
knew
that
hardly
at
any
time
could
hine
have
stood
in
greater
peril
to
chamonix
he
must
go
and
to
chamonix
he
must
take
sylvia
too
for
by
the
time
when
he
could
reach
chamonix
he
might
already
be
too
late
there
might
be
publicity
inquiries
and
for
garratt
skinner
ruin
and
worse
than
ruin
would
sylvia
let
her
lover
share
the
dishonor
of
her
name
he
knew
very
surely
she
would
not
therefore
he
would
have
the
marriage
by
the
way
he
said
as
he
draped
her
cloak
about
her
shoulders
you
have
that
telegram
from
jarvice
yes
that
good
he
said
it
might
be
useful
chapter
xxii
revailloud
revisited
never
that
familiar
journey
across
france
seemed
to
chayne
so
slow
would
he
be
in
time
would
he
arrive
too
late
the
throb
of
the
wheels
beat
out
the
questions
in
a
perpetual
rhythm
and
gave
him
no
answer
the
words
of
jarvice
telegram
were
ever
present
in
his
mind
and
grew
more
sinister
the
more
he
thought
upon
them
what
are
you
waiting
for
hurry
up
once
when
the
train
stopped
over
long
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
muttered
the
words
aloud
and
then
glanced
in
alarm
at
his
wife
lest
perchance
she
had
overheard
them
but
she
had
not
she
was
remembering
her
former
journey
along
this
very
road
then
it
had
been
night
now
it
was
day
then
she
had
been
used
to
seek
respite
from
her
life
in
the
shelter
of
her
dreams
now
the
dreams
were
of
no
use
since
what
was
real
made
them
by
comparison
so
pale
and
thin
the
blood
ran
strong
and
joyous
in
her
veins
and
looking
at
her
chayne
sent
up
his
prayers
that
they
might
not
arrive
in
chamonix
too
late
to
him
as
to
her
walter
hine
was
a
mere
puppet
a
thing
without
importance
so
long
as
he
lived
but
he
must
live
dead
he
threatened
ruin
and
dishonor
and
since
from
the
beginning
sylvia
and
he
had
shared
for
so
she
would
have
it
had
shared
in
the
effort
to
save
this
life
it
would
be
well
for
them
he
thought
that
they
should
not
fail
the
long
hot
day
drew
to
an
end
and
at
last
from
the
platform
at
the
end
of
the
electric
train
they
saw
the
lift
toward
the
soaring
peaks
and
the
peaks
purple
with
the
after
glow
stand
solitary
and
beautiful
against
the
evening
sky
at
last
said
sylvia
with
a
catch
in
her
breath
and
the
clasp
of
her
hand
tightened
upon
her
husband
arm
but
chayne
was
remembering
certain
words
once
spoken
to
him
in
a
garden
of
dorsetshire
by
a
man
who
lay
idly
in
a
hammock
and
stared
up
between
the
leaves
on
the
most
sunny
day
the
mountains
hold
in
their
recesses
mystery
and
death
you
know
where
your
father
is
staying
chayne
asked
he
wrote
from
the
hôtel
de
sylvia
replied
we
will
stay
at
couttet
and
walk
over
to
see
him
this
evening
said
chayne
and
after
dinner
they
strolled
across
the
little
town
but
at
the
hôtel
de
they
found
neither
garratt
skinner
nor
his
friend
walter
hine
only
the
day
before
yesterday
said
the
proprietor
they
started
for
the
mountains
always
they
make
expeditions
chayne
drew
no
satisfaction
from
that
statement
garratt
skinner
and
his
friend
would
make
many
expeditions
from
which
both
men
would
return
in
safety
garratt
skinner
was
no
blunderer
and
when
at
the
last
he
returned
alone
with
some
flawless
story
of
an
accident
in
which
his
friend
had
lost
his
life
no
one
would
believe
but
that
here
was
another
mishap
and
another
name
to
be
added
to
the
alpine
to
what
mountain
have
they
gone
chayne
asked
to
no
mountain
they
cross
the
col
du
géant
monsieur
to
courmayeur
but
after
that
i
do
not
know
oh
into
italy
said
chayne
in
relief
so
far
there
was
no
danger
the
col
du
géant
that
great
pass
between
france
and
italy
across
the
range
of
mont
blanc
was
almost
a
highway
there
would
be
too
many
parties
abroad
amongst
its
ice
séracs
on
these
days
of
summer
for
any
deed
which
needed
solitude
and
secrecy
when
do
you
expect
them
back
in
five
days
monsieur
not
before
and
at
this
reply
chayne
fears
were
all
renewed
for
clearly
the
expedition
was
not
to
end
with
the
passage
of
the
col
du
géant
there
was
to
be
a
sequel
perhaps
some
hazardous
ascent
some
expedition
at
all
events
which
garratt
skinner
had
not
thought
fit
to
name
they
took
guides
i
suppose
he
said
one
guide
monsieur
and
a
porter
monsieur
need
not
fear
for
monsieur
skinner
is
of
an
excellence
prodigious
my
father
exclaimed
sylvia
in
surprise
i
never
knew
what
guide
asked
chayne
pierre
delouvain
and
so
once
again
chayne
fears
were
allayed
he
turned
to
sylvia
a
good
name
sweetheart
i
never
climbed
with
him
but
i
know
him
by
report
a
prudent
man
as
prudent
as
he
is
skilful
he
would
run
no
risks
the
name
gave
him
indeed
greater
comfort
than
even
his
words
expressed
delouvain
mere
presence
would
prevent
the
commission
of
any
crime
his
great
strength
would
not
be
needed
to
hinder
it
for
he
would
be
there
to
bear
witness
afterward
chayne
was
freed
from
the
dread
which
during
the
last
two
days
had
oppressed
him
perhaps
after
all
sylvia
was
right
and
the
plot
was
definitely
abandoned
chayne
knew
very
well
that
garratt
skinner
passion
for
the
alps
was
a
deep
and
real
one
perhaps
it
was
that
alone
which
had
brought
him
back
to
chamonix
perhaps
one
day
in
the
train
traveling
northward
from
italy
he
had
looked
from
the
window
and
seen
the
slopes
of
monte
rosa
white
in
the
sun
white
with
the
look
of
white
velvet
and
all
the
last
twenty
years
had
fallen
from
him
like
a
cloak
and
he
had
been
drawn
back
as
with
chains
to
the
high
playground
of
his
youth
chayne
could
very
well
understand
that
possibility
and
eased
of
his
fears
he
walked
away
with
sylvia
back
to
the
open
square
in
the
middle
of
the
town
darkness
had
come
and
both
stopped
with
one
accord
and
looked
upward
to
the
massive
barrier
of
hills
the
rock
peaks
stood
sharply
up
against
the
clear
dark
sky
the
glimmered
faintly
like
a
pale
mist
and
incredibly
far
incredibly
high
underneath
a
bright
and
dancing
star
shone
a
dim
and
rounded
whiteness
the
of
mont
blanc
a
year
ago
said
sylvia
drawing
a
breath
and
bethinking
her
of
the
black
shadows
which
during
those
twelve
months
had
lain
across
her
path
yes
a
year
ago
we
were
here
said
chayne
the
little
square
was
thronged
the
hotels
and
houses
were
bright
with
lights
and
from
here
and
from
there
music
floated
out
upon
the
air
the
light
and
lilting
melodies
of
the
day
sylvia
you
see
the
café
down
the
street
there
by
the
bridge
yes
a
year
ago
on
just
such
a
night
as
this
i
sat
with
my
guide
michel
revailloud
i
was
going
to
cross
the
col
dolent
on
the
morrow
he
had
made
his
last
ascent
we
were
not
very
cheerful
and
he
gave
me
as
a
parting
present
the
one
scrap
of
philosophy
his
life
had
taught
him
he
said
care
that
when
the
time
comes
for
you
to
get
old
that
you
have
some
one
to
share
your
memories
take
care
that
when
you
go
home
in
the
end
there
shall
be
some
one
waiting
in
the
room
and
the
lamp
lit
against
your
coming
sylvia
pressed
against
her
side
the
hand
which
he
had
slipped
through
her
arm
but
he
did
more
than
give
advice
chayne
continued
for
as
he
went
away
to
his
home
in
the
little
village
of
les
just
across
the
fields
he
passed
couttet
hotel
and
saw
you
under
the
lamp
talking
to
a
guide
he
knew
you
were
making
your
arrangements
to
ascend
the
charmoz
but
he
dissuaded
you
yes
he
convinced
you
that
your
first
mountain
should
be
the
aiguille
he
gave
you
no
doubt
many
reasons
but
not
the
real
one
which
he
had
in
his
thoughts
sylvia
looked
at
chayne
in
surprise
he
sent
you
to
the
aiguille
because
he
knew
that
so
you
and
i
would
meet
at
the
pavilion
de
lognan
but
he
had
never
spoken
to
me
until
that
night
exclaimed
sylvia
yet
he
had
noticed
you
when
i
went
up
to
fetch
down
my
friend
lattery
you
were
standing
on
the
hotel
step
you
said
to
me
am
sorry
michel
heard
you
speak
and
that
evening
talked
of
you
he
had
the
thought
that
you
and
i
were
matched
sylvia
looked
back
to
the
night
before
her
first
ascent
she
pictured
to
herself
the
old
guide
coming
down
the
narrow
street
and
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
light
of
the
lamp
above
the
doorway
she
recalled
how
he
had
stopped
at
the
sight
of
her
how
cunningly
he
had
spoken
he
had
desired
that
her
last
step
on
to
her
first
summit
should
bring
to
her
eyes
and
soul
a
revelation
which
no
length
of
after
years
could
dim
that
was
the
argument
and
it
was
just
the
argument
which
would
prevail
with
her
so
it
was
his
doing
she
cried
with
a
laugh
and
at
once
grew
serious
dwelling
as
lovers
will
upon
the
small
accident
which
had
brought
them
together
and
might
so
easily
never
have
occurred
an
unknown
guide
speaks
to
her
in
a
doorway
and
lo
for
her
the
world
is
changed
dark
years
come
to
an
end
the
pathway
broadens
to
a
road
she
walks
not
alone
whatever
the
future
may
hold
she
walks
not
alone
suppose
there
had
been
no
lamp
above
the
doorway
suppose
there
had
been
a
lamp
and
she
not
there
suppose
the
guide
had
passed
five
minutes
sooner
or
five
minutes
later
oh
hilary
she
cried
and
put
the
thought
from
her
i
was
thinking
he
said
that
if
you
were
not
tired
we
might
walk
across
the
fields
to
michel
house
he
would
i
think
be
very
happy
if
we
did
a
few
minutes
later
they
knocked
upon
michel
door
michel
revailloud
opened
it
himself
and
stood
for
a
moment
peering
at
the
dim
figures
in
the
darkness
of
the
road
it
is
i
michel
said
chayne
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
michel
revailloud
drew
him
with
a
cry
of
welcome
into
the
house
so
you
have
come
back
to
chamonix
monsieur
that
is
good
and
he
looked
his
monsieur
over
from
head
to
foot
and
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
ah
you
have
come
back
and
not
alone
michel
said
chayne
revailloud
turned
to
the
door
and
saw
sylvia
standing
there
she
was
on
the
threshold
and
the
light
reached
to
her
sylvia
moved
into
the
room
it
was
a
big
long
room
bare
and
with
a
raftered
ceiling
and
since
one
oil
lamp
lighted
it
it
was
full
of
shadows
to
chayne
it
had
a
lonely
and
a
dreary
look
he
thought
of
his
own
house
in
sussex
and
of
the
evening
he
had
passed
there
thinking
it
just
as
lonely
he
felt
perhaps
at
this
moment
more
than
at
any
the
value
of
the
great
prize
which
he
had
won
he
took
her
hand
in
his
and
turning
to
michel
said
simply
we
are
married
michel
we
reached
chamonix
only
this
evening
you
are
the
first
of
our
friends
to
know
of
our
marriage
michel
face
lighted
up
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
visitors
and
nodded
his
head
once
or
twice
then
he
blew
his
nose
vigorously
but
i
let
you
stand
he
cried
in
a
voice
that
shook
a
little
and
he
bustled
about
pushing
chairs
forward
and
of
a
sudden
stopped
he
came
forward
to
sylvia
very
gravely
and
held
out
his
hand
she
put
her
hand
into
his
great
palm
madame
i
will
not
pretend
to
you
that
i
am
not
greatly
moved
this
is
a
great
happiness
to
me
he
said
with
simplicity
he
made
no
effort
to
hide
either
the
tears
which
filled
his
eyes
or
the
unsteadiness
of
his
voice
i
am
very
glad
for
the
sake
of
monsieur
chayne
but
i
know
him
well
we
have
been
good
friends
for
many
a
year
madame
i
know
michel
she
said
and
i
can
say
therefore
with
confidence
i
am
very
glad
for
your
sake
too
i
am
also
very
glad
for
mine
a
minute
ago
i
was
sitting
here
alone
now
you
are
both
here
and
together
madame
it
was
a
kind
thought
which
brought
you
both
here
to
me
at
once
to
whom
else
should
we
come
said
sylvia
with
a
smile
since
it
was
you
michel
who
would
not
let
me
ascend
the
aiguille
des
charmoz
when
i
wanted
to
michel
was
taken
aback
for
a
moment
then
his
wrinkled
and
weatherbeaten
face
grew
yet
more
wrinkled
and
he
broke
into
a
low
and
very
pleasant
laugh
since
my
diplomacy
has
been
so
successful
madame
i
will
not
deny
it
from
the
first
moment
when
i
heard
you
with
your
small
and
pretty
voice
say
on
the
steps
of
the
hotel
am
sorry
to
my
patron
in
his
great
distress
and
when
i
saw
your
face
too
thoughtful
for
one
so
young
i
thought
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
if
you
and
he
could
come
together
in
youth
to
be
lonely
what
is
it
you
slip
on
your
hat
and
your
cloak
and
you
go
out
but
when
you
are
old
and
your
habits
are
settled
and
you
do
not
want
to
go
out
at
nights
to
search
for
company
then
it
is
as
well
to
have
a
companion
and
it
is
well
to
choose
your
companion
in
your
youth
madame
so
that
you
may
have
many
recollections
to
talk
over
together
when
the
good
of
life
is
chiefly
recollection
he
made
his
visitors
sit
down
fetched
out
a
bottle
of
wine
and
offered
them
the
hospitalities
of
his
house
easily
and
naturally
like
the
true
gentleman
he
was
it
seemed
to
chayne
that
he
looked
a
little
older
that
he
was
a
little
more
heavy
in
his
gait
a
little
more
troubled
with
his
eyes
than
he
had
been
last
year
but
at
all
events
he
had
the
spirit
the
of
his
youth
he
talked
of
old
exploits
upon
peaks
then
unclimbed
he
brought
out
his
guide
book
in
which
his
messieurs
had
written
down
their
names
and
the
dates
of
the
climbs
and
the
photographs
which
they
had
sent
to
him
there
are
many
photographs
of
men
grown
famous
madame
he
said
proudly
with
whom
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
climb
when
they
and
i
and
the
alps
were
all
young
together
but
it
is
not
only
the
famous
who
are
interesting
look
madame
here
is
your
husband
friend
monsieur
lattery
a
good
climber
but
not
always
very
sure
on
ice
you
always
will
say
that
michel
protested
chayne
i
never
knew
a
man
so
obstinate
michel
revailloud
smiled
and
said
to
sylvia
i
knew
he
would
spring
out
on
me
never
say
a
word
against
monsieur
lattery
if
you
would
keep
friends
with
monsieur
chayne
see
i
give
you
good
advice
in
return
for
your
kindness
in
visiting
an
old
man
nevertheless
and
he
dropped
his
voice
in
a
pretence
of
secrecy
and
nodded
emphatically
it
is
true
monsieur
lattery
was
not
always
sure
on
ice
and
here
madame
is
the
portrait
of
one
whose
name
is
no
doubt
known
to
you
in
london
professor
kenyon
sylvia
who
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
guide
little
book
looked
up
at
the
photograph
it
was
taken
many
years
ago
she
said
twenty
or
years
ago
said
michel
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
when
he
and
i
and
the
alps
were
young
chayne
began
quickly
to
look
through
the
photographs
outspread
upon
the
table
if
kenyon
portrait
was
amongst
revailloud
small
treasures
there
might
be
another
which
he
had
no
wish
for
his
wife
to
see
the
portrait
of
the
man
who
climbed
with
kenyon
who
was
kenyon
john
lattery
there
might
well
be
the
group
before
the
monte
rosa
hotel
in
zermatt
which
he
himself
had
seen
in
kenyon
rooms
fortunately
however
or
so
it
seemed
to
him
sylvia
was
engrossed
in
michel
little
book
chapter
xxiii
michel
revailloud
führbuch
the
book
indeed
was
of
far
more
interest
to
her
than
the
portrait
of
any
mountaineer
it
had
a
romance
a
glamour
of
its
own
it
was
just
a
little
with
pages
and
an
old
soiled
leather
cover
which
could
fit
into
the
breast
pocket
and
never
be
noticed
there
but
it
went
back
to
the
early
days
of
mountaineering
when
even
the
passes
were
not
all
discovered
and
many
of
them
were
still
uncrossed
when
mythical
peaks
were
still
gravely
allotted
their
positions
and
approximate
heights
in
the
maps
and
when
the
easy
expedition
of
the
young
lady
of
was
the
difficult
achievement
of
the
explorer
it
was
to
the
early
part
of
the
book
to
which
she
turned
here
she
found
first
ascents
of
which
she
had
read
with
her
heart
in
her
mouth
ascents
since
made
famous
simply
recorded
in
the
handwriting
of
the
men
who
had
accomplished
them
the
dates
the
hours
of
starting
and
returning
a
word
or
two
perhaps
about
the
condition
of
the
snow
a
warm
tribute
to
michel
revailloud
and
the
signatures
the
same
names
recurred
year
after
year
and
often
the
same
hand
recorded
year
after
year
attempts
on
one
particular
pinnacle
until
at
the
last
perhaps
after
fifteen
or
sixteen
failures
weather
and
snow
and
the
determination
of
the
climbers
conspired
together
and
the
top
was
reached
those
were
the
grand
days
cried
sylvia
michel
you
must
be
proud
of
this
book
i
value
it
very
much
madame
he
said
smiling
at
her
enthusiasm
michel
was
a
human
person
and
to
have
a
young
girl
with
a
lovely
face
looking
at
him
out
of
her
great
eyes
in
admiration
and
speaking
almost
in
a
voice
of
awe
was
flattery
of
a
soothing
kind
yes
many
have
offered
to
buy
it
from
me
at
a
great
price
americans
and
others
but
i
would
not
part
with
it
it
is
me
and
when
i
am
inclined
to
grumble
as
old
people
will
and
to
complain
that
my
bones
ache
too
sorely
i
have
only
to
turn
over
the
pages
of
that
book
to
understand
that
i
have
no
excuse
to
grumble
for
i
have
the
proof
there
that
my
life
has
been
very
good
to
live
no
i
would
not
part
with
that
little
book
sylvia
turned
over
the
pages
slowly
naming
now
this
mountain
now
that
and
putting
a
question
from
time
to
time
as
to
some
point
in
a
climb
which
she
remembered
to
have
read
and
concerning
which
the
narrative
had
not
been
clear
and
then
a
cry
of
surprise
burst
from
her
lips
chayne
had
just
assured
himself
that
there
was
no
portrait
of
gabriel
strood
amongst
those
spread
out
upon
the
table
what
is
it
madame
asked
michel
sylvia
did
not
answer
but
stared
in
bewilderment
at
the
open
page
chayne
saw
the
book
which
she
was
reading
and
knew
that
his
care
lest
she
should
come
across
her
father
portrait
was
of
no
avail
he
crossed
round
behind
her
chair
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
there
on
the
page
in
her
father
handwriting
was
the
signature
gabriel
strood
sylvia
raised
her
face
to
hilary
and
before
she
could
put
her
question
he
answered
it
quietly
with
a
nod
of
the
head
yes
that
is
so
he
said
you
knew
i
have
known
for
a
long
time
he
replied
sylvia
was
lost
in
wonder
yet
there
was
no
doubt
in
her
mind
gabriel
strood
of
whom
she
had
made
a
hero
whose
exploits
she
knew
almost
by
heart
had
suffered
from
a
physical
disability
which
might
well
have
kept
the
most
eager
mountaineer
to
the
level
it
was
because
of
his
mastery
over
his
disability
that
she
had
set
him
so
high
in
her
esteem
well
there
had
been
a
day
when
her
father
had
tramped
across
the
downs
to
dorchester
and
had
come
back
lame
and
in
spite
of
his
lameness
had
left
his
companions
behind
other
trifles
recurred
to
her
memory
she
had
found
him
reading
the
alps
in
and
yes
he
had
tried
to
hide
from
her
the
title
of
the
book
on
their
first
meeting
he
had
understood
at
once
when
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
the
emotion
which
her
first
mountain
peak
had
waked
in
her
and
before
that
yes
her
guide
had
cried
aloud
to
her
you
remind
me
of
gabriel
strood
she
owed
it
to
him
that
she
had
turned
to
the
alps
as
to
her
heritage
and
that
she
had
brought
to
them
an
instinctive
knowledge
her
first
feeling
was
one
of
sheer
pride
in
her
father
then
the
doubts
began
to
thicken
he
called
himself
garratt
skinner
why
but
why
she
cried
impulsively
and
chayne
still
leaning
on
her
chair
pressed
her
arm
with
his
hand
and
warned
her
to
be
silent
i
will
tell
you
afterward
he
said
quietly
and
then
he
suddenly
drew
himself
upright
the
movement
was
abrupt
like
the
movement
of
a
man
thoroughly
startled
more
startled
even
than
she
had
been
by
the
unexpected
sight
of
her
father
handwriting
she
looked
up
into
his
face
he
was
staring
at
the
open
page
of
michel
book
she
turned
back
to
it
herself
and
saw
nothing
which
should
so
trouble
him
over
gabriel
strood
signature
there
were
just
these
words
written
in
his
hand
and
nothing
more
mont
blanc
by
the
brenva
route
july
yet
it
was
just
that
sentence
which
had
so
startled
hilary
gabriel
strood
then
climbed
mont
blanc
from
the
italian
side
up
from
the
glacier
to
the
top
of
the
great
then
along
the
thin
as
a
knife
edge
and
to
right
and
left
precipitous
as
a
wall
and
on
the
far
side
above
the
up
the
hanging
glaciers
and
the
to
the
summit
of
the
corridor
from
the
italian
side
of
the
range
of
mont
blanc
and
the
day
before
yesterday
gabriel
strood
had
crossed
with
walter
hine
to
italy
bound
upon
some
expedition
which
would
take
five
days
five
days
at
the
least
it
was
to
the
brenva
ascent
of
mont
blanc
that
garratt
skinner
was
leading
walter
hine
the
thought
flashed
upon
chayne
swift
as
an
inspiration
and
as
convincing
chayne
was
sure
the
brenva
route
it
was
to
this
climb
garratt
skinner
thoughts
had
perpetually
recurred
during
that
one
summer
afternoon
in
the
garden
in
dorsetshire
when
he
had
forgotten
his
secrecy
and
spoken
even
with
his
enemy
of
the
one
passion
they
had
in
common
chayne
worked
out
the
dates
and
they
fitted
in
with
his
belief
two
days
ago
garratt
skinner
started
to
cross
the
col
du
géant
he
would
sleep
very
likely
in
the
hut
on
the
col
and
go
down
the
next
morning
to
courmayeur
and
make
his
arrangements
for
the
brenva
climb
on
the
third
day
he
would
set
out
with
walter
hine
and
sleep
at
the
gîte
on
the
rocks
in
the
bay
to
the
right
of
the
great
of
the
brenva
glacier
he
would
ascend
the
buttress
traverse
the
with
walter
hine
perhaps
yes
only
perhaps
and
at
that
thought
chayne
heart
stood
still
and
even
if
he
did
there
were
the
hanging
above
and
yet
another
day
would
pass
before
any
alarm
at
his
absence
would
be
felt
surely
it
would
be
the
brenva
route
garratt
skinner
himself
would
run
great
risk
upon
this
hazardous
expedition
that
was
true
but
chayne
knew
enough
of
the
man
to
be
assured
that
he
would
not
hesitate
on
that
account
the
very
audacity
of
the
exploit
marked
it
out
as
gabriel
strood
moreover
there
would
be
no
other
party
on
the
brenva
ridge
to
spy
upon
his
actions
there
was
just
one
fact
so
far
as
chayne
could
judge
to
discredit
his
inspiration
the
inconvenient
presence
of
a
guide
do
you
know
a
guide
delouvain
michel
indeed
yes
a
good
name
monsieur
and
borne
by
a
man
worthy
of
it
so
i
thought
said
chayne
pierre
delouvain
and
michel
laughed
scornfully
and
waved
the
name
away
pierre
no
indeed
he
cried
monsieur
never
engage
pierre
delouvain
for
your
guide
i
speak
solemnly
joseph
yes
and
whenever
you
can
secure
him
i
thought
you
spoke
of
him
but
pierre
he
is
a
cousin
who
lives
upon
joseph
name
a
worthless
fellow
a
drunkard
monsieur
never
trust
yourself
or
any
one
whom
you
hold
dear
with
pierre
delouvain
chayne
last
doubt
was
dispelled
garratt
skinner
had
laid
his
plans
for
the
brenva
route
somewhere
on
that
long
and
difficult
climb
the
accident
was
to
take
place
the
very
choice
of
a
guide
was
in
itself
a
confirmation
of
chayne
fears
it
was
a
piece
of
subtlety
altogether
in
keeping
with
garratt
skinner
he
had
taken
a
bad
and
untrustworthy
guide
on
one
of
the
most
difficult
expeditions
in
the
range
of
mont
blanc
why
he
would
be
asked
and
the
answer
was
ready
he
had
confused
pierre
delouvain
with
joseph
his
cousin
as
no
doubt
many
another
man
had
done
before
did
not
pierre
live
on
that
very
confusion
the
answer
was
not
capable
of
refutation
chayne
was
in
despair
garratt
skinner
had
started
two
days
before
from
chamonix
was
already
now
at
this
moment
asleep
with
his
unconscious
victim
at
his
side
high
up
on
the
rocks
of
the
upper
brenva
glacier
there
was
no
way
to
hinder
him
no
way
unless
god
helped
he
asked
abruptly
of
michel
have
you
climbed
this
season
michel
michel
laughed
grimly
indeed
yes
to
the
montanvert
monsieur
and
beyond
yes
beyond
to
the
jardin
chayne
broke
in
upon
his
bitter
humor
i
want
the
best
guide
in
chamonix
i
want
him
at
once
i
must
start
by
daylight
michel
glanced
up
in
surprise
but
what
he
saw
in
chayne
face
stopped
all
remonstrance
for
what
ascent
monsieur
he
asked
the
brenva
route
madame
will
not
go
no
i
go
alone
i
must
go
quickly
there
is
very
much
at
stake
i
beg
you
to
help
me
in
answer
michel
took
his
hat
down
from
a
peg
and
while
he
did
so
chayne
turned
quickly
to
his
wife
she
had
risen
from
her
chair
but
she
had
not
interrupted
him
she
had
asked
no
questions
she
had
uttered
no
prayer
she
stood
now
waiting
upon
him
with
a
quiet
and
beautiful
confidence
which
deeply
stirred
his
heart
thank
you
sweetheart
he
said
quietly
you
can
trust
i
thank
you
and
he
added
gravely
whatever
happens
you
and
i
there
is
no
altering
that
michel
opened
the
door
i
will
walk
with
you
into
chamonix
and
i
will
bring
the
best
guides
i
can
find
to
your
hotel
they
passed
out
and
crossed
the
fields
quickly
to
chamonix
do
you
go
to
your
hotel
monsieur
said
revailloud
and
leave
the
choice
to
me
i
must
go
about
it
quietly
if
you
were
to
come
with
me
we
should
have
to
choose
the
first
two
guides
upon
the
rota
and
that
would
not
do
for
the
brenva
climb
he
left
them
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
and
went
off
upon
his
errand
sylvia
turned
at
once
to
hilary
her
face
was
very
pale
her
voice
shook
you
will
tell
me
everything
now
something
terrible
has
happened
no
doubt
you
feared
it
you
came
to
chamonix
because
you
feared
it
and
now
you
know
that
it
has
happened
yes
said
chayne
i
hid
it
from
you
even
as
you
spared
me
your
bad
news
all
this
last
year
tell
me
now
please
if
it
is
to
be
and
i
as
you
said
just
now
you
will
tell
me
chayne
led
the
way
into
the
garden
and
drawing
a
couple
of
chairs
apart
from
the
other
visitors
told
her
all
that
he
knew
and
she
did
not
he
explained
the
episode
of
the
lighted
window
solved
for
her
the
riddle
of
her
father
friendship
for
walter
hine
and
showed
her
the
reason
for
this
expedition
to
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
she
uttered
one
low
cry
of
horror
murder
she
whispered
to
think
that
we
are
two
days
behind
that
even
now
they
are
sleeping
on
the
rocks
and
walter
hine
sleeping
quite
peacefully
and
quietly
oh
it
horrible
he
cried
beating
his
hands
upon
his
forehead
in
despair
and
then
he
broke
off
he
saw
that
sylvia
was
sitting
with
her
hands
covering
her
face
while
every
now
and
then
a
shudder
shook
her
and
set
her
trembling
i
am
so
sorry
sylvia
he
cried
oh
my
dear
i
had
so
hoped
we
should
be
in
time
i
would
have
spared
you
this
knowledge
if
i
could
who
knows
we
may
be
still
in
time
and
as
he
spoke
michel
entered
the
garden
with
one
other
man
and
came
toward
him
henri
simond
said
michel
presenting
his
companion
you
will
know
that
name
simond
has
just
come
down
from
the
grépon
monsieur
he
will
start
with
you
at
daylight
chayne
looked
at
simond
he
was
of
no
more
than
the
middle
height
but
broad
of
shoulder
deep
of
chest
and
long
of
arm
his
strength
was
well
known
in
chamonix
as
well
known
as
his
audacity
i
am
very
glad
that
you
can
come
simond
said
chayne
you
are
the
very
man
and
then
he
turned
to
michel
but
we
should
have
another
guide
i
need
two
men
yes
said
michel
three
men
are
needed
for
that
climb
and
chayne
left
him
to
believe
that
it
was
merely
for
the
climb
that
he
needed
another
guide
but
there
is
andré
droz
already
at
courmayeur
he
continued
his
patron
was
to
leave
him
there
a
telegram
can
be
sent
to
him
bidding
him
wait
if
he
has
started
we
shall
meet
him
on
the

michel
replied
chayne
gratefully
and
thereupon
sylvia
plucked
him
by
the
sleeve
i
must
go
with
you
hilary
she
pleaded
wistfully
oh
you
wo
leave
me
here
let
me
come
with
you
as
far
as
possible
let
me
cross
to
italy
i
will
go
quick
if
i
get
tired
you
shall
not
know
it
will
be
a
long
day
sylvia
it
can
not
be
so
long
as
the
day
i
should
pass
waiting
here
she
wrung
her
hands
as
she
spoke
the
light
from
a
lamp
fixed
in
the
hotel
wall
fell
upon
her
upturned
face
it
was
white
her
lips
trembled
and
in
her
eyes
chayne
saw
again
the
look
of
terror
which
he
had
hoped
was
gone
forever
oh
please
she
whispered
yes
he
replied
and
he
turned
again
to
simond
at
two
then
my
wife
will
go
so
bring
a
mule
we
can
leave
it
at
the
montanvert
the
guides
tramped
from
the
garden
chayne
led
his
wife
toward
the
hotel
slipping
his
arm
through
hers
you
must
get
some
sleep
sylvia
oh
hilary
she
cried
i
shall
bring
shame
on
you
we
should
never
have
married
and
her
voice
broke
in
a
sob
hush
he
replied
never
say
that
my
dear
never
think
it
sleep
you
will
want
your
strength
but
sylvia
slept
little
and
before
the
time
she
was
ready
with
her
in
her
hand
at
two
they
came
out
from
the
hotel
in
the
twilight
of
the
morning
there
were
two
men
there
ah
you
have
come
to
see
us
off
michel
said
chayne
no
monsieur
i
bring
my
mule
said
revailloud
with
a
smile
and
he
helped
sylvia
to
mount
it
to
lead
mules
to
the
montanvert
is
not
that
my
business
simond
has
a
rope
he
added
as
he
saw
chayne
sling
a
coil
across
his
shoulder
we
may
need
an
extra
one
said
chayne
and
the
party
moved
off
upon
its
long
march
at
the
montanvert
hotel
on
the
edge
of
the
mer
de
glace
sylvia
descended
from
her
mule
and
at
once
the
party
went
down
on
to
the
ice
au
revoir
shouted
michel
from
above
and
he
stood
and
watched
them
until
they
passed
out
of
his
sight
sylvia
turned
and
waved
her
hand
to
him
but
he
made
no
answering
sign
for
his
eyes
were
no
longer
good
he
is
very
kind
said
sylvia
he
understood
that
there
was
some
trouble
and
while
he
led
the
mule
he
sought
to
comfort
me
and
then
between
a
laugh
and
a
sob
she
added
you
will
never
guess
how
he
offered
to
give
me
his
little
book
with
all
the
signatures
the
little
book
which
means
so
much
to
him
it
was
the
one
thing
which
he
had
to
offer
her
as
sylvia
understood
and
always
thereafter
she
remembered
him
with
a
particular
tenderness
he
had
been
a
good
friend
to
her
asking
nothing
and
giving
what
he
had
she
saw
him
often
in
the
times
which
were
to
come
but
when
she
thought
of
him
she
pictured
him
as
on
that
early
morning
standing
on
the
bluff
of
cliff
by
the
montanvert
with
the
reins
of
his
mule
thrown
across
his
arm
and
straining
his
old
eyes
to
hold
his
friends
in
view
later
during
that
day
amongst
the
séracs
of
the
col
du
géant
simond
uttered
a
shout
and
a
party
of
guides
returning
to
chamonix
changed
their
course
toward
him
droz
was
amongst
the
number
and
consenting
at
once
to
the
expedition
which
was
proposed
to
him
he
tied
himself
on
to
the
rope
do
you
know
the
brenva
ascent
chayne
asked
of
him
yes
monsieur
i
have
crossed
mont
blanc
once
that
way
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
go
again
we
shall
be
the
first
to
cross
for
two
years
if
only
the
weather
holds
do
you
doubt
that
asked
chayne
anxiously
the
morning
had
broken
clear
the
day
was
sunny
and
cloudless
i
think
there
may
be
wind
he
replied
raising
his
face
and
judging
by
signs
unappreciable
to
other
than
the
trained
eyes
of
a
guide
but
we
will
try
eh
monsieur
he
cried
recovering
his
spirits
we
will
try
we
will
be
the
first
on
the
brenva
ridge
for
two
years
but
there
chayne
knew
him
to
be
wrong
there
was
another
party
somewhere
on
the
great
ridge
at
this
moment
had
happened
he
asked
himself
how
was
it
to
happen
what
kind
of
an
accident
was
it
to
be
which
could
take
place
with
a
guide
however
worthless
and
which
would
leave
no
suspicion
resting
on
garratt
skinner
there
would
be
no
cutting
of
the
rope
of
that
he
felt
sure
that
method
might
do
very
well
for
a
melodrama
but
actually
no
garratt
skinner
would
have
a
better
plan
than
that
and
indeed
he
had
a
better
plan
and
a
simpler
one
a
plan
which
not
merely
would
give
to
any
uttered
suspicion
the
complexion
of
malignancy
but
must
even
bring
garratt
skinner
honor
and
great
praise
but
no
idea
of
the
plan
occurred
either
to
sylvia
or
to
chayne
as
all
through
that
long
hot
day
they
toiled
up
the
of
the
col
du
géant
and
over
the
passes
it
was
evening
before
they
came
to
the
pastures
night
before
they
reached
courmayeur
there
chayne
found
full
confirmation
of
his
fears
in
spite
of
effort
to
dissuade
them
garratt
skinner
walter
hine
and
pierre
delouvain
had
started
yesterday
for
the
brenva
climb
they
had
taken
porters
with
them
as
far
as
the
upon
the
glacier
rocks
the
porters
had
returned
chayne
sent
for
them
yes
they
said
at
half
past
two
this
morning
the
climbing
party
descended
from
the
rocks
on
to
the
of
the
glacier
they
should
be
at
the
hut
at
the
grands
mulets
now
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
if
not
already
in
chamonix
perhaps
monsieur
would
wish
for
porters
no
said
chayne
we
mean
to
try
the
passage
in
one
day
and
he
turned
to
his
guides
i
wish
to
start
at
midnight
it
is
important
we
shall
reach
the
glacier
by
five
will
you
be
ready
and
at
midnight
accordingly
he
set
out
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
sylvia
stood
outside
the
hotel
and
watched
the
flame
diminish
to
a
star
dance
for
a
little
while
and
then
go
out
for
her
as
for
all
women
the
bad
hour
had
struck
when
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
sit
and
watch
and
wait
perhaps
her
husband
after
all
was
wrong
she
said
to
herself
and
repeated
the
phrase
hoping
that
repetition
would
carry
conviction
to
her
heart
but
early
on
that
morning
chayne
had
sure
evidence
that
he
was
right
for
as
he
simond
and
andré
droz
were
marching
in
single
file
through
the
thin
forest
behind
the
chalets
of
la
brenva
a
shepherd
lad
came
running
down
toward
them
he
was
so
excited
that
he
could
hardly
tell
the
story
with
which
he
was
hurrying
to
courmayeur
only
an
hour
before
he
had
seen
high
up
on
the
brenva
ridge
a
man
waving
a
signal
of
distress
both
simond
and
droz
discredited
the
story
the
distance
was
too
great
the
sharpest
eyes
could
not
have
seen
so
far
but
chayne
believed
and
his
heart
sank
within
him
the
puppet
and
garratt
skinner
what
did
they
matter
but
he
turned
his
eyes
down
toward
courmayeur
it
was
sylvia
upon
whom
the
blow
would
fall
the
story
can
not
be
true
cried
simond
but
chayne
bethought
him
of
another
day
long
ago
when
a
lad
had
burst
into
the
hotel
at
zermatt
and
told
with
no
more
acceptance
for
his
story
of
an
avalanche
which
he
had
seen
fall
from
the
very
summit
of
the
matterhorn
chayne
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
just
four
there
has
been
an
accident
he
said
we
must
hurry
chapter
xxiv
the
brenva
ridge
the
peasant
was
right
he
seen
a
man
waving
a
signal
of
distress
on
the
slopes
of
mont
blanc
above
the
great
buttress
and
this
is
how
the
signal
came
to
be
waved
an
hour
before
chayne
and
sylvia
set
out
from
chamonix
to
cross
the
col
du
géant
and
while
it
was
yet
quite
dark
a
spark
glowed
suddenly
on
an
island
of
rocks
set
in
the
great
white
waste
of
the
brenva
glacier
the
spark
was
a
fire
lit
by
pierre
delouvain
for
garratt
skinner
party
had
camped
upon
those
rocks
the
morning
was
cold
and
one
by
one
the
porters
garratt
skinner
and
walter
hine
gathered
about
the
blaze
overhead
the
stars
glittered
in
a
clear
dark
sky
it
was
very
still
no
sound
was
heard
at
all
but
the
movement
in
the
camp
even
on
the
glacier
a
thousand
feet
below
where
all
night
long
the
avalanches
had
thundered
in
the
frost
of
the
early
morning
there
was
silence
garratt
skinner
looked
upward
we
shall
have
a
good
day
he
said
and
then
he
looked
quickly
toward
walter
hine
how
did
you
sleep
wallie
very
little
the
avalanches
kept
me
awake
besides
i
slipped
and
fell
a
hundred
times
at
the
corner
of
the
path
he
said
with
a
shiver
a
hundred
times
i
felt
emptiness
beneath
my
feet
he
referred
to
a
mishap
of
the
day
before
on
the
way
to
the
gîte
after
the
chalets
and
the
wood
are
left
behind
a
little
path
leads
along
the
rocks
of
the
mont
de
la
brenva
high
above
the
glacier
there
are
one
or
two
awkward
corners
to
pass
where
rough
footsteps
have
been
hewn
in
the
rock
at
one
of
these
corners
walter
hine
had
slipped
his
side
struck
the
step
he
would
have
dropped
to
the
glacier
but
garratt
skinner
had
suddenly
reached
out
a
hand
and
saved
him
garratt
skinner
face
changed
you
are
not
afraid
he
said
you
think
we
can
do
it
asked
hine
nervously
and
garratt
skinner
laughed
ask
pierre
delouvain
he
said
and
himself
put
the
question
pierre
laughed
in
his
turn
bah
i
snap
my
fingers
at
the
brenva
climb
said
he
we
shall
be
in
chamonix
and
garratt
skinner
translated
the
words
to
walter
hine
breakfast
was
prepared
and
eaten
walter
hine
was
silent
through
the
meal
he
had
not
the
courage
to
say
that
he
was
afraid
and
garratt
skinner
played
upon
his
vanity
we
shall
be
in
chamonix
it
will
be
a
fine
feather
in
your
cap
wallie
one
of
the
historic
climbs
walter
hine
drew
a
deep
breath
if
only
the
day
were
over
and
the
party
safe
on
the
rough
path
through
the
woods
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
but
he
held
his
tongue
moreover
he
had
great
faith
in
his
idol
and
master
garratt
skinner
you
saved
my
life
yesterday
he
said
and
upon
garratt
skinner
face
there
came
a
curious
smile
he
looked
steadily
into
the
blaze
of
the
fire
and
spoke
almost
as
though
he
made
an
apology
to
himself
i
saw
a
man
falling
i
saw
that
i
could
save
him
i
did
not
think
my
hand
had
already
caught
him
he
looked
up
with
a
start
in
the
east
the
day
was
breaking
pale
and
desolate
the
lower
glacier
glimmered
into
view
beneath
them
the
gigantic
amphitheater
of
hills
which
girt
them
in
on
three
sides
loomed
out
of
the
mists
from
aerial
heights
and
took
solidity
and
shape
westward
the
black
and
rugged
peuteret
ridge
eastward
the
cliffs
of
mont
maudit
and
northward
sweeping
around
the
head
of
the
glacier
the
great
of
mont
blanc
with
its
ruined
terraces
and
inaccessible
cliffs
time
wallie
said
garratt
skinner
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
called
to
pierre
delouvain
there
are
only
three
of
us
we
shall
have
to
go
quickly
we
do
not
want
to
carry
more
food
than
we
shall
need
the
rest
we
can
send
back
with
our
blankets
by
the
porters
pierre
delouvain
justified
at
once
the
ill
words
which
had
been
spoken
of
him
by
michel
revailloud
he
thought
only
of
the
burden
which
through
this
long
day
he
would
have
to
carry
on
his
back
yes
that
is
right
he
said
we
will
take
what
we
need
for
the
day
we
shall
be
in
chamonix
and
thus
the
party
set
off
with
no
provision
against
that
most
probable
of
all
mishaps
the
chance
that
sunset
might
find
them
still
upon
the
mountain
side
pierre
delouvain
being
lazy
and
a
worthless
fellow
as
revailloud
had
said
agreed
but
the
suggestion
had
been
made
by
garratt
skinner
and
garratt
skinner
was
gabriel
strood
who
knew
none
better
the
folly
of
such
light
traveling
the
rope
was
put
on
pierre
delouvain
led
the
way
walter
hine
as
the
weakest
of
the
party
was
placed
in
the
middle
garratt
skinner
came
last
the
three
men
mounted
by
a
and
a
gully
to
the
top
of
the
rocks
which
supported
the
upper
brenva
glacier
that
our
road
wallie
said
garratt
skinner
he
pointed
to
a
great
buttress
of
rock
overlain
here
and
there
with
fields
of
snow
which
jutted
out
from
the
of
the
mountain
descended
steeply
bent
to
the
west
in
a
curve
and
then
pushed
far
out
into
the
glacier
as
some
great
promontory
pushes
out
into
the
sea
do
you
see
a
hump
above
the
buttress
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
a
little
to
the
right
and
to
the
right
of
the
hump
a
depression
in
the
ridge
that
what
they
call
the
corridor
once
we
are
there
our
troubles
are
over
but
between
the
party
and
the
buttress
stretched
the
great
of
the
upper
brenva
glacier
crevassed
broken
a
wilderness
of
towering
séracs
it
had
the
look
of
a
sea
in
a
gale
whose
breakers
had
been
frozen
in
the
very
act
of
over
toppling
come
said
pierre
keep
the
rope
stretched
tight
wallie
said
garratt
skinner
and
they
descended
into
the
furrows
of
that
wild
and
frozen
sea
the
day
work
had
begun
in
earnest
and
almost
at
once
they
began
to
lose
time
now
it
was
a
perilous
strip
of
ice
between
unfathomable
blue
depths
along
which
they
must
pass
as
along
their
girders
yet
without
the
knowledge
that
at
the
end
of
the
passage
there
was
a
further
way
now
it
was
some
crevasse
into
which
they
must
descend
cutting
their
steps
down
a
steep
rib
of
ice
now
it
was
a
wall
up
which
the
leader
must
be
hoisted
on
the
shoulders
of
his
companions
and
even
so
as
likely
as
not
his
fingers
could
not
reach
the
top
but
hand
holds
and
foot
holds
must
be
hewn
with
the
ax
till
a
ladder
was
formed
now
it
was
some
crevasse
gaping
across
their
path
they
must
search
this
way
and
that
for
a
firm
by
which
to
overpass
it
it
was
difficult
as
pierre
delouvain
discovered
to
find
a
path
through
that
tangled
labyrinth
without
some
knowledge
of
the
glacier
for
only
at
rare
times
when
he
stood
high
on
a
sérac
could
he
see
his
way
for
more
than
a
few
yards
ahead
pierre
aimed
straight
for
the
foot
of
the
buttress
working
thus
due
north
and
he
was
wrong
garratt
skinner
knew
it
but
said
not
a
word
he
stood
upon
insecure
ledges
and
supported
delouvain
upon
his
shoulders
and
pushed
him
up
with
his
into
positions
which
only
involved
the
party
in
further
difficulties
he
took
his
life
in
his
hands
and
risked
it
knowing
the
better
way
yet
all
the
while
the
light
broadened
the
great
violet
shadows
crept
down
the
slopes
and
huddled
at
the
bases
of
the
peaks
then
the
peaks
took
fire
and
suddenly
along
the
dull
white
slopes
of
ice
in
front
of
them
the
fingers
of
the
morning
flashed
in
gold
over
the
eastern
rocks
the
sun
had
leaped
into
the
sky
for
a
little
while
longer
they
advanced
deeper
into
the
entanglement
and
when
they
were
about
half
way
across
they
came
to
a
stop
they
were
on
a
tongue
of
ice
which
narrowed
to
a
point
the
point
abutted
against
a
perpendicular
thirty
feet
high
nowhere
was
there
any
break
in
that
wall
and
at
each
side
of
the
tongue
the
ice
gaped
in
chasms
we
must
go
back
said
pierre
i
have
forgotten
the
way
he
had
never
known
it
seduced
by
a
treble
fee
he
had
assumed
an
experience
which
he
did
not
possess
garratt
skinner
looked
at
his
watch
and
turning
about
led
the
party
back
for
a
little
while
then
he
turned
to
his
right
and
said
i
think
it
might
go
in
this
direction
and
lo
making
steadily
across
some
difficult
ground
no
longer
in
a
straight
line
northward
to
mont
blanc
but
westward
toward
the
cliffs
of
the
peuteret
ridge
under
garratt
skinner
lead
they
saw
a
broad
causeway
of
ice
open
before
them
the
causeway
led
them
to
steep
slopes
of
snow
up
which
it
was
just
possible
to
kick
steps
and
then
working
back
again
to
the
east
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
great
buttress
on
its
western
side
just
where
it
forms
a
right
angle
with
the
face
of
the
mountain
garratt
skinner
once
more
looked
at
his
watch
it
had
been
two
when
they
had
put
on
the
rope
it
was
now
close
upon
six
they
had
taken
four
hours
to
traverse
the
and
they
should
have
taken
only
two
and
a
half
garratt
skinner
however
expressed
no
anxiety
on
the
contrary
one
might
have
thought
that
he
wished
to
lose
time
there
one
of
the
difficulties
disposed
of
he
said
cheerily
you
did
very
well
wallie
very
well
it
was
not
altogether
nice
was
it
but
you
wo
have
to
go
back
walter
hine
had
indeed
crossed
the
glacier
without
complaint
there
had
been
times
when
he
had
shivered
times
when
his
heart
within
him
had
swelled
with
a
longing
to
cry
out
let
us
go
back
but
he
had
not
dared
he
had
been
steadied
across
the
narrow
bridge
with
the
rope
hauled
up
the
and
let
down
again
on
the
other
side
but
he
had
come
through
he
took
some
pride
in
the
exploit
as
he
gazed
back
from
the
top
of
the
across
the
tumult
of
ice
to
the
rocks
on
which
he
had
slipped
he
had
come
through
safely
and
he
was
encouraged
to
go
on
we
wo
stop
here
i
think
said
garratt
skinner
they
had
already
halted
upon
the
glacier
for
a
second
breakfast
the
sun
was
getting
hot
upon
the
slopes
above
and
small
showers
of
snow
and
crusts
of
ice
were
beginning
to
shoot
down
the
gullies
of
the
buttress
at
the
base
of
which
they
stood
we
will
have
a
third
breakfast
when
we
are
out
of
range
he
called
to
delouvain
who
was
examining
the
face
of
the
up
which
they
must
ascend
to
its
crest
and
said
it
looks
as
if
we
should
do
well
to
work
out
to
the
right
i
think
the
rocks
were
difficult
but
their
difficulty
was
not
fully
appreciated
by
walter
hine
nor
did
he
understand
the
danger
there
were
gullies
in
which
new
snow
lay
in
a
thin
crust
over
hard
ice
he
noticed
that
in
those
gullies
the
steps
were
cut
deep
into
the
ice
below
that
garratt
skinner
bade
him
not
loiter
and
that
pierre
delouvain
in
front
made
himself
fast
and
drew
in
the
rope
with
a
particular
care
when
it
came
to
his
turn
to
move
but
he
did
not
know
that
all
that
surface
snow
might
peel
off
in
a
moment
and
swish
down
the
cliffs
sweeping
the
party
from
their
feet
there
were
rounded
rocks
and
slabs
with
no
hold
for
hand
or
foot
but
roughness
roughness
in
the
surface
and
here
and
there
a
wrinkle
but
the
guide
went
first
as
often
as
not
pushed
up
by
garratt
skinner
and
walter
hine
like
many
another
inefficient
man
before
him
came
up
like
a
bundle
on
the
rope
afterward
thus
they
climbed
for
three
hours
more
walter
hine
nursed
by
gradually
lengthening
expeditions
was
not
as
yet
tired
moreover
the
exhilaration
of
the
air
and
excitement
helped
to
keep
fatigue
aloof
they
rested
just
below
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
took
another
meal
eat
often
and
little
that
the
golden
rule
said
garratt
skinner
no
brandy
wallie
keep
that
in
your
flask
pierre
delouvain
however
followed
a
practice
not
unknown
amongst
chamonix
guides
absinthe
is
good
on
the
mountains
said
he
when
they
rose
the
order
of
going
was
changed
pierre
delouvain
who
had
led
all
the
morning
now
went
last
and
garratt
skinner
led
he
led
quickly
and
with
great
judgment
or
knowledge
pierre
delouvain
at
the
end
of
the
rope
wondered
whether
it
was
judgment
or
knowledge
and
suddenly
walter
hine
found
himself
standing
on
the
crest
with
garratt
skinner
and
looking
down
the
other
side
upon
a
glacier
far
below
which
flows
from
the
mur
de
la
côte
on
the
summit
ridge
of
mont
blanc
into
the
brenva
glacier
that
famous
cried
garratt
skinner
looking
once
more
at
his
watch
he
did
not
say
that
they
had
lost
yet
another
hour
upon
the
face
of
the
buttress
it
was
now
half
past
nine
in
the
morning
we
are
twelve
thousand
feet
up
wallie
and
he
swung
to
his
left
and
led
the
party
up
the
ridge
of
the
buttress
as
they
went
along
this
ridge
wallie
hine
courage
rose
it
was
narrow
but
not
steep
nor
was
it
ice
it
was
either
rock
or
snow
in
which
steps
could
be
kicked
he
stepped
out
with
a
greater
confidence
if
this
were
all
the
brenva
climb
was
a
fraud
he
exclaimed
to
himself
in
the
vanity
of
his
heart
ahead
of
them
a
tall
black
tower
stood
up
hiding
what
lay
beyond
and
up
toward
this
tower
garratt
skinner
led
quickly
he
no
longer
spoke
to
his
companions
he
went
forward
assured
and
inspiring
assurance
he
reached
the
tower
passed
it
and
began
to
cut
steps
his
ax
rang
as
it
fell
it
was
ice
into
which
he
was
cutting
this
was
the
first
warning
which
walter
hine
received
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
it
he
was
intent
upon
setting
his
feet
in
the
steps
he
found
the
rope
awkward
to
handle
and
keep
tight
his
attention
was
absorbed
in
observing
his
proper
distance
moreover
in
front
of
him
the
stalwart
figure
of
garratt
skinner
blocked
his
vision
he
went
forward
the
snow
on
which
he
walked
became
hard
ice
and
instead
of
sloping
upward
ran
ahead
almost
in
a
horizontal
line
suddenly
however
it
narrowed
hine
became
conscious
of
appalling
depths
on
either
side
of
him
it
narrowed
with
extraordinary
rapidity
half
a
dozen
paces
behind
him
he
had
been
walking
on
a
broad
smooth
path
now
he
walked
on
the
width
of
the
top
of
a
garden
wall
his
knees
began
to
shake
he
halted
he
reached
out
vainly
into
emptiness
for
some
support
on
which
his
shaking
hands
might
clutch
and
then
in
front
of
him
he
saw
garratt
skinner
sit
down
and
bestride
the
wall
over
garratt
skinner
head
he
now
saw
the
path
by
which
he
needs
must
go
he
was
on
the
famous
and
nothing
so
formidable
so
terrifying
had
even
entered
into
his
dreams
during
his
sleep
upon
the
rocks
where
he
had
bivouacked
it
thinned
to
a
mere
sharp
edge
a
line
without
breadth
of
cold
blue
ice
and
it
stretched
away
through
the
air
for
a
great
distance
until
it
melted
suddenly
into
the
face
of
the
mountain
on
the
left
hand
an
almost
vertical
slope
of
ice
dropped
to
depths
which
hine
did
not
dare
to
fathom
with
his
eyes
on
the
right
there
was
no
slope
at
all
a
wall
of
crumbling
snow
descended
from
the
edge
straight
as
a
weighted
line
on
neither
side
could
the
point
of
the
ax
be
driven
in
to
preserve
the
balance
walter
hine
uttered
a
whimpering
cry
i
shall
fall
i
shall
fall
garratt
skinner
astride
of
the
ridge
looked
over
his
shoulder
sit
down
he
cried
sharply
but
walter
hine
dared
not
he
stood
all
his
courage
gone
tottering
on
the
narrow
top
of
the
wall
afraid
to
stoop
lest
his
knees
should
fail
him
altogether
and
his
feet
slip
from
beneath
him
to
bend
down
until
his
hands
could
rest
upon
the
ice
and
meanwhile
to
keep
his
feet
no
he
could
not
do
it
he
stood
trembling
his
face
distorted
with
fear
and
his
body
swaying
a
little
from
side
to
side
garratt
skinner
called
sharply
to
pierre
delouvain
quick
pierre
there
was
no
time
for
garratt
skinner
to
return
but
he
gathered
himself
together
on
the
ridge
ready
for
a
spring
had
walter
hine
toppled
over
and
swung
down
the
length
of
the
rope
as
at
any
moment
he
might
have
done
garratt
skinner
was
prepared
he
would
have
jumped
down
the
opposite
side
of
the
though
how
either
he
or
walter
hine
could
have
regained
the
ridge
he
could
not
tell
would
any
one
of
the
party
live
to
return
to
courmayeur
and
tell
the
tale
but
garratt
skinner
knew
the
risk
he
took
had
counted
it
up
long
before
ever
he
brought
walter
hine
to
chamonix
and
thought
it
worth
while
he
did
not
falter
now
all
through
the
morning
indeed
he
had
been
taking
risks
risks
of
which
walter
hine
did
not
dream
with
so
firm
and
yet
so
delicate
a
step
he
had
moved
from
crack
to
crack
from
up
to
with
so
obedient
a
response
of
his
muscles
he
had
drawn
himself
up
over
the
rounded
rocks
from
ledge
to
ledge
he
shouted
again
to
pierre
delouvain
and
at
the
same
moment
began
carefully
to
work
backward
along
the
pierre
however
hurried
walter
hine
heard
the
guide
voice
behind
him
felt
himself
steadied
by
his
hands
he
stooped
slowly
down
knelt
upon
the
wall
then
bestrode
it
now
forward
cried
skinner
and
he
pulled
in
the
rope
forward
we
can
not
go
back
hine
clung
to
the
ridge
behind
him
pierre
delouvain
sat
down
and
held
him
about
the
waist
slowly
they
worked
themselves
forward
while
garratt
skinner
gathered
in
the
rope
in
front
the
wall
narrowed
as
they
advanced
became
the
merest
edge
which
cut
their
hands
as
they
clasped
it
hine
closed
his
eyes
his
head
whirled
he
was
giddy
he
felt
sick
he
stopped
gripping
the
slope
on
both
sides
with
his
knees
clutching
the
sharp
edge
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
i
ca
go
on
i
ca
he
cried
and
he
reeled
like
a
novice
on
the
back
of
a
horse
garratt
skinner
worked
back
to
him
put
your
arms
about
my
waist
wallie
keep
your
eyes
shut
you
sha
fall
walter
hine
clung
to
him
convulsively
pierre
delouvain
steadied
hine
from
behind
and
thus
they
went
slowly
forward
for
a
long
while
garratt
skinner
gripped
the
edge
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
so
narrow
was
the
ridge
the
fingers
of
one
hand
pointed
down
one
slope
the
fingers
of
the
other
down
the
opposite
wall
their
legs
dangled
at
last
walter
hine
felt
garratt
skinner
loosening
his
clasped
fingers
from
about
his
waist
garratt
skinner
stood
up
uncoiled
the
rope
chipped
a
step
or
two
in
the
ice
and
went
boldly
forward
for
a
yard
or
two
further
walter
hine
straddled
on
and
then
garratt
skinner
cried
to
him
look
up
wallie
it
all
over
hine
looked
and
saw
garratt
skinner
standing
upon
a
level
space
of
snow
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
a
moment
later
he
himself
was
lying
in
the
sun
upon
the
level
space
the
famous
was
behind
them
walter
hine
looked
back
along
it
and
shuddered
the
thin
edge
of
ice
curving
slightly
downward
stretched
away
to
the
black
in
the
bright
sunlight
a
thing
most
beautiful
but
most
menacing
and
terrible
he
seemed
cut
off
by
it
from
the
world
they
had
a
meal
upon
that
level
space
and
while
hine
rested
pierre
delouvain
cast
off
the
rope
and
went
ahead
he
came
back
in
a
little
while
with
a
serious
face
will
it
go
asked
garratt
skinner
it
must
said
delouvain
for
we
can
never
go
back
and
suddenly
alarmed
lest
the
way
should
be
barred
in
front
as
well
as
behind
walter
hine
turned
and
looked
above
him
his
nerves
were
already
shaken
at
the
sight
of
what
lay
ahead
of
him
he
uttered
a
cry
of
despair
it
no
use
he
cried
we
can
never
get
up
and
he
flung
himself
upon
the
snow
and
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
garratt
skinner
stood
over
him
we
must
he
said
come
look
walter
hine
looked
up
and
saw
his
companion
dangling
the
face
of
his
watch
before
his
eyes
we
are
late
it
is
now
twelve
we
should
have
left
this
spot
two
hours
ago
and
more
he
said
very
gravely
and
pierre
delouvain
exclaimed
excitedly
certainly
monsieur
we
must
go
on
it
will
not
do
to
loiter
now
and
stooping
down
he
dragged
rather
than
helped
walter
hine
to
his
feet
the
quiet
gravity
of
garratt
skinner
and
the
excitement
of
delouvain
frightened
walter
hine
equally
some
sense
of
his
own
insufficiency
broke
in
at
last
upon
him
his
vanity
peeled
off
from
him
just
at
the
moment
when
it
would
most
have
been
of
use
he
had
a
glimpse
of
what
he
was
a
poor
weak
inefficient
thing
above
them
the
slopes
stretched
upward
to
a
great
line
of
towering
through
and
up
those
a
way
had
to
be
found
and
at
any
moment
loosened
by
the
sun
huge
blocks
and
pinnacles
might
break
from
them
and
come
thundering
down
as
it
was
upon
their
right
hand
where
the
fell
steeply
in
a
huge
ice
gully
between
a
line
of
rocks
and
the
cliffs
of
mont
maudit
the
avalanches
plunged
and
reverberated
down
to
the
brenva
glacier
pierre
delouvain
took
the
lead
again
and
keeping
by
the
line
of
rocks
the
party
ascended
the
steep
straight
toward
the
wall
of
cliffs
but
in
a
while
the
snow
thinned
and
the
ax
was
brought
into
play
again
through
the
thin
crust
of
snow
steps
had
to
be
cut
into
the
ice
beneath
and
since
there
were
still
many
hundreds
of
feet
to
be
ascended
the
steps
were
cut
wide
apart
with
the
sun
burning
upon
his
face
and
his
feet
freezing
in
the
walter
hine
stood
and
moved
and
stood
again
all
through
that
afternoon
fatigue
gained
upon
him
and
fear
did
not
let
him
go
if
only
i
get
off
this
mountain
he
said
to
himself
with
heartfelt
longing
never
again
when
near
to
the
cliffs
pierre
delouvain
stopped
in
front
of
him
the
wall
was
plainly
inaccessible
far
away
to
the
left
there
was
a
depression
up
which
possibly
a
way
might
be
forced
i
think
monsieur
that
must
be
the
way
said
pierre
but
you
should
said
garratt
skinner
it
is
some
time
since
i
was
here
i
have
forgotten
and
pierre
began
to
traverse
the
to
the
left
garratt
skinner
followed
without
a
word
but
he
knew
that
when
he
had
ascended
mont
blanc
by
the
brenva
route
years
before
he
had
kept
to
the
right
along
the
rocks
to
a
point
where
that
was
crevassed
and
through
that
crevasse
had
found
his
path
they
passed
quickly
beneath
an
overhanging
rib
of
ice
which
jutted
out
from
the
wall
and
reached
the
angle
then
formed
at
four
in
the
afternoon
our
last
difficulty
wallie
said
garratt
skinner
as
he
cut
a
large
step
in
which
hine
might
stand
once
up
that
wall
our
troubles
are
over
walter
hine
looked
at
the
wall
it
was
not
smooth
ice
it
was
true
blocks
had
broken
loose
from
it
and
had
left
it
bulging
out
here
there
and
in
places
fissured
but
it
stood
at
an
angle
of
degrees
it
seemed
impossible
that
any
one
should
ascend
it
he
looked
down
the
slope
up
which
they
had
climbed
it
seemed
equally
impossible
that
any
one
should
return
moreover
the
sun
was
already
in
the
west
and
the
ice
promontory
under
which
they
stood
shut
its
warmth
from
them
walter
hine
was
in
the
shadow
and
he
shivered
with
cold
as
much
as
with
fear
for
half
an
hour
pierre
delouvain
tried
desperately
to
work
his
way
up
that
ice
wall
and
failed
it
is
too
late
he
said
we
shall
not
get
up
garratt
skinner
nodded
his
head
no
nor
get
down
he
added
gravely
i
am
sorry
wallie
we
must
go
back
and
find
a
place
where
we
can
pass
the
night
walter
hine
was
in
despair
he
was
tired
he
was
desperately
cold
his
gloves
were
frozen
his
fingers
and
his
feet
benumbed
oh
let
stop
here
he
cried
we
ca
said
garratt
skinner
and
he
turned
as
he
spoke
and
led
the
way
down
quickly
there
was
need
for
hurry
every
now
and
then
he
stopped
to
cut
an
intervening
step
where
those
already
cut
were
too
far
apart
and
at
times
to
give
hine
a
hand
while
delouvain
let
him
down
with
the
help
of
the
rope
from
behind
slowly
they
descended
and
while
they
descended
the
sun
disappeared
the
mists
gathered
about
the
precipices
below
the
thunder
of
the
avalanches
was
heard
at
rare
intervals
the
above
them
glimmered
faintly
and
still
more
faintly
the
dusk
came
they
descended
in
a
ghostly
twilight
at
times
the
mists
would
part
and
below
them
infinite
miles
away
they
saw
the
of
the
brenva
glacier
the
light
was
failing
altogether
when
garratt
skinner
turned
to
his
left
and
began
to
traverse
the
slopes
to
a
small
patch
of
rocks
here
he
said
as
he
reached
them
we
must
sit
here
until
the
morning
comes
chapter
xxv
a
night
on
an
at
the
base
of
the
rocks
there
was
a
narrow
ledge
on
which
huddled
together
the
three
men
could
sit
side
by
side
garratt
skinner
began
to
clear
the
snow
from
the
ledge
with
his
but
walter
hine
sank
down
at
once
and
pierre
delouvain
who
might
have
shown
a
better
spirit
promptly
followed
his
example
what
is
the
use
he
whispered
we
shall
all
die
i
have
a
wife
and
family
let
us
eat
what
there
is
to
eat
and
then
die
and
drowsily
repeating
his
words
he
fell
asleep
garratt
skinner
however
roused
him
and
drowsily
he
helped
to
clear
the
ledge
then
walter
hine
was
placed
in
the
middle
that
he
might
get
what
warmth
and
shelter
was
to
be
had
the
rope
was
hitched
over
a
spike
of
rock
behind
so
that
if
any
one
fell
asleep
he
might
not
fall
off
and
delouvain
and
skinner
took
their
places
by
this
time
darkness
had
come
they
sat
upon
the
narrow
ledge
with
their
backs
to
the
rock
and
the
steep
falling
away
at
their
feet
far
down
a
light
or
two
glimmered
in
the
chalets
of
la
brenva
garratt
skinner
emptied
the
on
his
knees
let
us
see
what
food
we
have
he
said
we
made
a
mistake
in
not
bringing
more
but
pierre
was
so
certain
that
we
should
reach
chamonix
we
shall
die
said
pierre
nonsense
said
garratt
skinner
we
are
not
the
first
party
which
has
been
caught
by
the
night
their
stock
of
food
was
certainly
low
it
consisted
of
a
little
bread
a
tin
of
sardines
a
small
pot
of
jam
some
cold
bacon
a
bag
of
a
couple
of
cakes
of
chocolate
and
a
few
biscuits
we
must
keep
some
for
the
morning
he
said
do
fall
asleep
wallie
you
had
better
take
off
your
boots
and
muffle
your
feet
in
the
it
will
keep
them
warmer
and
save
you
from
you
might
as
well
squeeze
the
water
out
of
your
stockings
too
garratt
skinner
waked
hine
from
his
drowsiness
and
insisted
that
his
advice
should
be
followed
it
would
be
advisable
that
it
should
be
known
afterward
in
courmayeur
that
he
had
taken
every
precaution
to
preserve
his
companion
life
he
took
off
his
own
stockings
and
squeezed
the
water
out
replaced
them
and
laced
on
his
boots
for
to
him
too
the
night
would
bring
some
risk
then
the
three
men
ate
their
supper
a
very
little
wine
was
left
in
the
gourd
which
garratt
skinner
had
carried
on
his
back
and
he
filled
it
up
with
snow
and
thrust
it
inside
his
shirt
that
it
might
melt
the
sooner
you
have
your
brandy
flask
wallie
but
be
sparing
of
it
brandy
will
warm
you
for
the
moment
but
it
leaves
you
more
sensitive
to
the
cold
than
you
were
before
that
a
known
fact
and
do
drink
too
much
of
this
it
may
make
you
burn
inside
at
least
so
i
have
been
told
he
added
hine
drank
and
passed
the
bottle
to
pierre
who
took
it
with
his
reiterated
moan
what
the
use
we
shall
all
die
why
should
a
poor
guide
with
a
wife
and
family
be
tempted
to
ascend
mountains
i
will
tell
you
something
monsieur
he
cried
suddenly
across
walter
hine
i
am
not
fond
of
the
mountains
no
i
am
not
fond
of
them
and
he
leaned
back
and
fell
asleep
better
not
follow
his
example
wallie
keep
awake
slap
your
limbs
above
the
three
men
the
stars
came
out
very
clear
and
bright
the
tiny
lights
in
the
chalets
far
below
disappeared
one
by
one
the
cold
became
intense
at
times
garratt
skinner
roused
his
companions
and
holding
each
other
by
the
arm
they
rose
simultaneously
to
their
feet
and
stamped
upon
the
ledge
but
every
movement
hurt
them
and
after
a
while
walter
hine
would
not
leave
me
alone
he
said
to
move
tortures
me
garratt
skinner
had
his
pipe
and
some
tobacco
he
lit
shading
the
match
with
his
coat
and
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
what
time
is
it
is
it
near
morning
asked
hine
in
a
voice
which
was
very
feeble
a
little
longer
to
wait
said
garratt
skinner
cheerfully
the
hands
marked
a
quarter
to
ten
and
afterward
they
grew
very
silent
except
for
the
noise
which
they
made
in
shivering
their
teeth
chattered
with
the
chill
they
shook
in
fits
which
lasted
for
minutes
walter
hine
moaned
feebly
all
about
them
the
world
was
bound
in
frost
the
cold
stars
glittered
overhead
the
mountains
took
their
toll
of
pain
that
night
yet
there
was
one
among
those
three
perched
high
on
a
narrow
ledge
of
rock
amongst
the
desolate
heights
who
did
not
regret
just
for
a
night
like
this
garratt
skinner
had
hoped
walter
hine
weak
of
frame
and
with
little
stamina
was
exposed
to
the
rigors
of
a
long
alpine
night
thirteen
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
with
hardly
any
food
and
no
hope
of
rescue
for
yet
another
day
and
yet
another
night
there
could
be
but
one
end
to
it
not
until
would
any
alarm
at
their
disappearance
be
awakened
either
at
chamonix
or
at
courmayeur
it
would
need
a
second
night
before
help
reached
them
so
garratt
skinner
had
planned
it
out
there
could
be
but
one
end
to
it
walter
hine
would
die
there
was
a
risk
that
he
himself
might
suffer
the
same
fate
he
was
not
blind
to
it
he
had
taken
the
risk
knowingly
and
with
a
certain
indifference
it
was
the
best
plan
since
if
he
escaped
alive
suspicion
could
not
fall
on
him
thus
he
argued
as
he
smoked
his
pipe
with
his
back
to
the
rock
and
waited
for
the
morning
at
one
walter
hine
began
to
ramble
he
took
garratt
skinner
and
pierre
delouvain
for
captain
barstow
and
archie
parminter
and
complained
that
it
was
ridiculous
to
sit
up
playing
poker
on
so
cold
a
night
and
while
in
his
delirium
he
rambled
and
moaned
the
morning
began
to
break
but
with
the
morning
came
a
wind
from
the
north
whirling
the
snow
like
smoke
about
the
and
bitingly
cold
garratt
skinner
with
great
difficulty
stood
up
slowly
and
with
pain
stretched
himself
to
his
full
height
slapped
his
thighs
stamped
with
his
feet
and
then
looked
for
a
long
while
at
his
victim
without
remorse
and
without
satisfaction
he
stooped
and
sought
to
lift
him
but
hine
was
too
stiff
and
numbed
with
the
cold
to
be
able
to
move
in
a
little
while
pierre
delouvain
who
had
fallen
asleep
woke
up
the
day
was
upon
them
now
cold
and
lowering
we
must
wait
for
the
sun
said
garratt
skinner
until
that
has
risen
and
thawed
us
it
will
not
be
safe
to
move
pierre
delouvain
looked
about
him
worked
the
stiffened
muscles
of
his
limbs
and
groaned
there
will
be
little
sun
he
said
we
shall
all
die
here
garratt
skinner
sat
down
again
and
waited
the
sun
rose
over
the
rocks
of
mont
maudit
but
weak
and
yellow
as
a
guinea
garratt
skinner
then
tied
his
coat
to
his
and
standing
out
upon
a
rock
waved
it
this
way
and
that
no
one
will
see
it
whimpered
pierre
and
indeed
garratt
skinner
would
never
have
waved
that
signal
had
he
not
thought
the
same
perhaps
one
never
knows
he
said
we
must
take
all
precautions
for
the
day
looks
bad
the
sunlight
indeed
only
stayed
upon
the
long
enough
to
tantalize
them
with
vain
hopes
of
warmth
gray
clouds
swept
up
low
over
the
crest
of
mont
blanc
and
blotted
it
out
the
wind
moaned
wildly
along
the
slopes
the
day
frowned
upon
them
sullen
and
cold
with
a
sky
full
of
snow
we
will
wait
a
little
longer
said
garratt
skinner
then
we
must
move
he
looked
at
the
sky
it
seemed
to
him
now
very
probable
that
he
would
lose
the
desperate
game
which
he
had
been
playing
he
had
staked
his
life
upon
it
let
the
snow
come
and
the
mists
he
would
surely
lose
his
stake
nevertheless
he
set
himself
to
the
task
of
rousing
walter
hine
leave
me
alone
moaned
walter
hine
and
he
struck
feebly
at
his
companions
as
they
lifted
him
on
to
his
feet
stamp
your
feet
wallie
said
garratt
skinner
you
will
feel
better
in
a
few
moments
they
held
him
up
but
he
repeated
his
cry
leave
me
alone
and
the
moment
they
let
him
go
he
sank
down
again
upon
the
ledge
he
was
overcome
with
drowsiness
the
slightest
movement
tortured
him
garratt
skinner
looked
up
at
the
leaden
sky
we
must
wait
till
help
comes
he
said
delouvain
shook
his
head
it
will
not
come
we
shall
all
die
here
it
was
wrong
monsieur
to
try
the
brenva
ridge
yes
we
shall
die
here
and
he
fell
to
blubbering
like
a
child
could
you
go
down
alone
garratt
skinner
asked
there
is
the
glacier
to
cross
monsieur
i
know
that
is
the
risk
but
it
is
cold
and
there
is
no
sun
the
may
hold
pierre
delouvain
hesitated
here
it
seemed
to
him
was
certain
death
but
if
he
climbed
down
the
the
and
the
rocks
below
if
the
held
upon
the
glacier
there
would
be
life
for
one
of
the
three
pierre
delouvain
had
little
in
common
with
that
loyal
race
of
alpine
guides
who
hold
it
as
their
most
sacred
tradition
not
to
return
home
without
their
patrons
yes
it
is
our
one
hope
he
said
and
untying
himself
with
awkward
fumbling
fingers
from
the
kinked
rope
and
coiling
the
spare
rope
about
his
shoulders
he
went
down
the
slope
during
the
night
the
steps
had
frozen
and
in
many
places
it
was
necessary
to
recut
them
he
too
was
stiff
with
the
long
vigil
he
moved
slowly
with
numbed
and
frozen
limbs
but
as
his
ax
rose
and
fell
the
blood
began
to
burn
in
the
tips
of
his
fingers
to
flow
within
his
veins
he
went
more
and
more
firmly
for
a
long
way
garratt
skinner
held
him
in
sight
then
he
turned
back
to
walter
hine
upon
the
ledge
and
sat
beside
him
garratt
skinner
strength
had
stood
him
in
good
stead
he
filled
his
pipe
and
lit
it
and
watched
beside
his
victim
the
day
wore
on
slowly
at
times
garratt
skinner
rubbed
hine
limbs
and
stamped
about
the
ledge
to
keep
some
warmth
within
himself
walter
hine
grew
weaker
and
weaker
at
times
he
was
delirious
at
times
he
came
to
his
senses
you
leave
me
he
whispered
once
you
have
been
a
good
friend
to
me
you
can
do
no
more
just
leave
me
here
and
save
yourself
garratt
skinner
made
no
answer
he
just
looked
at
hine
curiously
that
was
all
that
was
all
it
was
a
curious
thing
to
him
that
hine
should
display
an
unexpected
manliness
almost
a
heroism
it
could
not
be
pleasant
even
to
contemplate
being
left
alone
upon
these
windy
and
sunless
heights
to
die
but
actually
to
wish
it
how
did
you
come
by
so
much
fortitude
he
asked
and
to
his
astonishment
walter
hine
replied
i
learnt
it
from
you
old
man
from
me
yes
garratt
skinner
gave
him
some
of
the
brandy
and
listened
to
a
portrait
of
himself
described
in
broken
words
which
he
was
at
some
pains
to
recognize
walter
hine
had
been
seeking
to
model
himself
upon
an
imaginary
garratt
skinner
and
thus
strangely
enough
had
arrived
at
an
actual
heroism
thus
would
garratt
skinner
have
bidden
his
friends
leave
him
only
in
tones
less
tremulous
and
very
likely
with
a
laugh
turning
back
as
it
were
to
snap
his
fingers
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
world
thus
therefore
walter
hine
sought
to
bear
himself
curious
said
garratt
skinner
with
interest
but
with
no
stronger
feeling
at
all
are
you
in
pain
wallie
dreadful
pain
we
must
wait
perhaps
help
will
come
the
day
wore
on
but
what
the
time
was
garratt
skinner
could
not
tell
his
watch
and
hine
had
both
stopped
with
the
cold
and
the
dull
clouded
sky
gave
him
no
clue
the
last
of
the
food
was
eaten
the
last
drop
of
the
brandy
drunk
it
was
bitterly
cold
if
only
the
snow
would
hold
off
till
morning
garratt
skinner
had
only
to
wait
the
night
would
come
and
during
the
night
walter
hine
would
die
and
even
while
the
thought
was
in
his
mind
he
heard
voices
to
his
amazement
to
his
alarm
he
heard
voices
then
he
laughed
he
was
growing
exhaustion
cold
and
hunger
were
telling
their
tale
upon
him
he
was
not
so
young
as
he
had
been
twenty
years
before
but
to
make
sure
he
rose
to
his
knees
and
peered
down
the
slope
he
had
been
mistaken
the
steep
stretched
downward
wild
and
empty
here
and
there
black
rocks
jutted
from
them
a
long
way
down
four
black
stones
were
spaced
there
was
no
living
thing
in
that
solitude
he
sank
back
relieved
no
living
thing
except
himself
and
perhaps
his
companion
he
looked
at
hine
closely
shook
him
and
hine
groaned
yes
he
still
lived
for
a
little
time
he
still
would
live
garratt
skinner
gathered
in
his
numbed
palm
the
last
pipeful
of
tobacco
in
his
pouch
and
spilling
the
half
of
it
his
hands
so
shook
with
cold
his
fingers
were
so
clumsy
he
pressed
it
into
his
pipe
and
lit
it
perhaps
before
it
was
all
smoked
out
he
thought
and
then
his
hallucination
returned
to
him
again
he
heard
voices
very
faint
and
distant
in
a
lull
of
the
wind
it
was
weakness
of
course
but
he
started
up
again
this
time
to
his
feet
and
as
he
stood
up
his
head
and
shoulders
showed
clear
against
the
white
snow
behind
him
he
heard
a
shout
yes
an
undoubted
shout
he
stared
down
the
slope
and
then
he
saw
the
four
black
stones
had
moved
were
nearer
to
him
they
were
four
men
ascending
garratt
skinner
turned
swiftly
toward
walter
hine
reached
for
his
grasped
it
and
raised
it
walter
hine
looked
at
him
with
staring
stupid
eyes
but
raised
no
hand
made
no
movement
he
too
was
conscious
of
an
hallucination
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
friend
stood
over
him
with
a
convulsed
and
murderous
face
in
which
rage
strove
with
bitter
disappointment
but
that
he
held
his
ax
by
the
end
with
the
swung
back
above
his
head
to
give
greater
force
to
the
blow
and
that
while
he
poised
it
there
came
a
cry
from
the
confines
of
the
world
and
that
upon
that
cry
his
friend
dropped
the
ax
and
stooping
down
to
him
murmured
there
help
quite
close
wallie
certainly
those
words
were
spoken
that
at
all
events
was
no
hallucination
walter
hine
understood
it
clearly
for
garratt
skinner
suddenly
stripped
off
his
coat
passed
it
round
hine
shoulders
and
then
baring
his
own
breast
clasped
hine
to
it
that
he
might
impart
to
him
some
warmth
from
his
own
body
thus
they
were
found
by
the
rescue
party
and
the
story
of
garratt
skinner
great
was
long
remembered
in
courmayeur
garratt
skinner
watched
the
men
mounting
and
wondered
who
they
were
he
recognized
his
own
guide
pierre
delouvain
but
who
were
the
others
how
did
they
come
there
on
a
morning
so
forbidding
who
was
the
tall
man
who
walked
last
but
one
and
as
the
party
drew
nearer
he
saw
and
understood
but
he
did
not
change
from
his
attitude
he
waited
until
they
were
close
then
he
and
hilary
chayne
exchanged
a
look
you
said
garratt
skinner
yes
chayne
paused
yes
strood
he
said
and
in
those
words
all
was
said
garratt
skinner
knew
that
his
plan
was
not
merely
foiled
but
also
understood
he
stood
up
and
looked
about
him
and
even
to
chayne
eyes
there
was
a
dignity
in
his
quiet
manner
his
patience
under
defeat
for
garratt
skinner
rogue
though
he
was
the
mountains
had
their
message
all
through
that
long
night
while
he
sat
by
the
side
of
his
victim
they
had
been
whispering
it
whether
bound
in
frost
beneath
the
stars
or
sparkling
to
the
sun
or
gray
under
a
sky
of
clouds
or
buried
deep
in
flakes
of
whirling
snow
they
spoke
to
him
always
of
the
grandeur
of
their
indifference
they
might
be
traversed
and
scaled
but
they
were
unconquered
always
because
they
were
indifferent
the
climber
might
lie
in
wait
through
the
bad
weather
at
the
base
of
the
peak
seize
upon
his
chance
and
stand
upon
the
summit
with
a
cry
of
triumph
and
derision
the
mountains
were
indifferent
as
they
endured
success
so
they
inflicted
defeat
with
a
sublime
indifference
lifting
their
foreheads
to
the
stars
as
though
wrapt
in
some
high
communion
something
of
their
patience
had
entered
into
garratt
skinner
he
did
not
deny
his
name
he
asked
no
question
he
accepted
failure
and
he
looked
anxiously
to
the
sky
it
will
snow
i
think
they
made
some
tea
mixed
it
with
wine
and
gave
it
first
of
all
to
walter
hine
then
they
all
breakfasted
and
set
off
on
their
homeward
journey
letting
hine
down
with
the
rope
from
step
to
step
gradually
hine
regained
a
little
strength
his
numbed
limbs
began
to
come
painfully
to
life
he
began
to
move
slowly
of
his
own
accord
supported
by
his
rescuers
they
reached
the
it
had
no
terrors
now
for
walter
hine
he
had
better
be
tied
close
between
pierre
and
myself
said
garratt
skinner
we
came
up
that
way
between
simond
and
droz
said
chayne
quietly
as
you
will
said
garratt
skinner
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
along
the
the
party
moved
slowly
and
safely
carrying
hine
between
them
as
they
passed
behind
the
great
rock
tower
at
the
lower
end
the
threatened
snow
began
to
fall
in
light
flakes
quickly
said
chayne
we
must
reach
the
chalets
they
raced
along
the
on
the
crest
of
the
buttress
and
turned
to
the
right
down
the
gullies
and
the
ledges
on
the
face
of
the
rock
in
desperate
haste
they
descended
lowering
walter
hine
from
man
to
man
they
crawled
down
the
slabs
dropped
from
shelf
to
shelf
wound
themselves
down
the
gullies
of
ice
somehow
without
injury
the
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
were
reached
the
snow
still
held
off
only
now
and
then
a
few
flakes
fell
but
over
the
mountain
the
wind
was
rising
it
swept
down
in
fierce
swift
eddies
and
drew
back
with
a
roar
like
the
sea
upon
shingle
we
must
get
off
the
glacier
before
night
comes
cried
chayne
and
led
by
simond
the
rescue
party
went
down
into
the
they
stopped
at
the
first
glacier
pool
and
made
hine
wash
his
hands
and
feet
in
the
water
to
save
himself
from
and
thereafter
for
a
little
time
they
rested
they
went
on
again
but
they
were
tired
men
and
before
the
rocks
were
reached
upon
which
two
nights
before
garratt
skinner
had
bivouacked
darkness
had
come
then
simond
justified
the
praise
of
michel
revailloud
with
the
help
of
a
folding
lantern
which
chayne
had
carried
in
his
pocket
he
led
the
way
through
that
bewildering
labyrinth
with
unerring
judgment
great
séracs
loomed
up
through
the
darkness
magnified
in
size
and
distorted
in
shape
simond
went
over
and
round
them
and
under
them
steadily
and
the
rescue
party
followed
now
he
disappeared
over
the
edge
of
a
cliff
into
space
and
in
a
few
seconds
his
voice
rang
upward
cheerily
follow
it
is
safe
and
his
rang
with
no
less
cheeriness
he
led
them
boldly
to
the
brink
of
abysses
which
were
merely
channels
in
the
ice
and
amid
towering
pinnacles
which
seen
close
at
hand
were
mere
blocks
shoulder
high
and
at
last
the
guide
at
the
tail
of
the
rope
heard
from
far
away
ahead
simond
voice
raised
in
a
triumphant
shout
the
rocks
the
rocks
with
one
accord
they
flung
themselves
tired
and
panting
on
the
sheltered
level
of
the
bivouac
some
sticks
were
found
a
fire
was
lighted
tea
was
once
more
made
walter
hine
began
to
take
heart
and
as
the
flames
blazed
up
the
six
men
gathered
about
it
crouching
kneeling
sitting
and
the
rocks
resounded
with
their
laughter
only
a
little
further
wallie
said
garratt
skinner
still
true
to
his
part
they
descended
from
the
rocks
crossed
a
level
field
of
ice
and
struck
the
rock
path
along
the
slope
of
the
mont
de
la
brenva
keep
on
the
rope
said
garratt
skinner
hine
slipped
at
a
corner
as
we
came
up
and
chayne
glanced
quickly
at
him
there
were
one
or
two
awkward
corners
above
the
lower
glacier
where
rough
footsteps
had
been
hewn
on
one
of
these
walter
hine
had
slipped
and
garratt
skinner
had
saved
him
had
undoubtedly
saved
him
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
climb
the
object
for
which
it
was
undertaken
was
almost
fulfilled
and
would
have
been
fulfilled
but
that
instinct
overpowered
garratt
skinner
and
since
the
accident
was
unexpected
before
he
had
had
time
to
think
he
had
reached
out
his
hand
and
saved
the
life
which
he
intended
to
destroy
along
that
path
hine
was
carefully
brought
to
the
chalets
of
la
brenva
the
peasants
made
him
as
comfortable
as
they
could
he
will
recover
said
simond
oh
yes
he
will
recover
two
of
us
will
stay
with
him
no
need
for
that
replied
garratt
skinner
thank
you
very
much
but
that
is
my
duty
since
hine
is
my
friend
i
think
not
said
chayne
standing
quietly
in
front
of
garratt
skinner
walter
hine
will
be
safe
enough
in
simond
hands
i
want
you
to
return
with
me
to
courmayeur
my
wife
is
there
and
anxious
your
wife
yes
sylvia
garratt
skinner
nodded
his
head
i
see
he
said
slowly
yes
he
looked
round
the
hut
simond
was
going
to
watch
by
hine
side
he
was
defeated
utterly
and
recognized
it
then
he
looked
at
chayne
and
smiled
grimly
on
the
whole
i
am
not
sorry
that
you
have
married
my
daughter
he
said
i
will
come
down
to
courmayeur
it
will
be
pleasant
to
sleep
in
a
bed
and
together
they
walked
down
to
courmayeur
which
they
reached
soon
after
midnight
chapter
xxvi
running
water
in
two
days
time
walter
hine
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
carried
down
to
courmayeur
he
had
been
very
near
to
death
upon
the
brenva
ridge
certainly
the
second
night
upon
which
garratt
skinner
had
counted
would
have
ended
his
life
he
was
frostbitten
and
for
a
long
while
the
shock
and
the
exposure
left
him
weak
but
he
gained
strength
with
each
day
and
chayne
had
opportunities
to
admire
the
audacity
and
the
subtle
skill
with
which
garratt
skinner
had
sought
his
end
for
walter
hine
was
loud
in
his
praises
of
his
friend
skinner
had
denied
himself
his
own
share
of
food
had
bared
his
breast
to
the
wind
that
he
might
give
the
warmth
of
his
own
body
to
keep
his
friend
alive
these
instances
lost
nothing
in
the
telling
and
they
were
true
chayne
could
not
deny
to
garratt
skinner
a
certain
criminal
grandeur
he
had
placed
hine
in
no
peril
which
he
had
not
shared
himself
he
had
taken
him
a
man
fitted
in
neither
experience
nor
health
on
an
expedition
where
inexperience
or
weakness
on
the
part
of
one
was
likely
to
prove
fatal
to
all
there
was
moreover
one
incident
not
contemplated
by
garratt
skinner
in
his
plan
which
made
his
position
absolutely
secure
he
had
actually
saved
walter
hine
life
on
the
rocky
path
of
the
mont
de
la
brenva
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
he
had
reached
out
his
hand
and
saved
him
chayne
made
much
of
this
incident
to
his
wife
i
was
wrong
you
see
sylvia
he
argued
for
your
father
could
have
let
him
fall
and
did
not
i
have
been
unjust
to
him
and
to
you
for
you
have
been
troubled
but
sylvia
shook
her
head
you
were
not
wrong
she
answered
it
is
only
because
you
are
very
kind
that
you
want
me
to
believe
it
but
i
see
the
truth
quite
clearly
and
she
smiled
at
him
if
you
wanted
me
to
believe
you
should
never
have
told
me
of
the
law
a
year
ago
in
the
chalet
de
lognan
my
father
obeyed
the
law
that
was
all
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
he
had
no
time
to
think
he
acted
upon
the
instinct
of
the
moment
he
could
not
do
otherwise
had
there
been
time
to
think
would
he
have
reached
out
his
hand
we
both
know
that
he
would
not
but
he
obeyed
the
law
what
he
knew
that
he
did
obeying
the
law
upon
the
moment
he
could
save
and
knowing
it
he
save
even
against
his
will
chayne
did
not
argue
the
point
sylvia
saw
the
truth
too
clearly
walter
hine
is
getting
well
he
said
your
father
is
still
at
another
hotel
in
courmayeur
there
the
future
to
be
considered
yes
she
said
and
she
waited
i
have
asked
your
father
to
come
over
after
dinner
said
chayne
and
into
their
private
garratt
skinner
entered
at
eight
that
evening
it
was
the
first
time
that
sylvia
had
seen
him
since
she
had
learned
the
whole
truth
and
she
found
the
occasion
one
of
trial
but
garratt
skinner
carried
it
off
there
was
nothing
of
the
penitent
in
his
manner
but
on
the
other
hand
he
no
longer
affected
the
manner
of
a
pained
and
loving
parent
he
greeted
her
from
the
door
and
congratulated
her
quietly
and
simply
upon
her
marriage
then
he
turned
to
chayne
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
i
am
at
your
service
yes
replied
chayne
we
and
i
speak
for
sylvia
we
wish
to
suggest
to
you
that
your
acquaintanceship
with
walter
hine
should
end
altogether
that
it
should
already
have
ended
really
said
garratt
skinner
with
an
air
of
surprise
captain
chayne
the
laws
of
england
revolutionary
as
they
have
no
doubt
become
to
people
like
myself
have
not
yet
placed
fathers
under
the
guardianship
of
their
i
can
not
accept
your
suggestion
we
insist
upon
its
acceptance
said
chayne
quietly
garratt
skinner
smiled
insist
perhaps
but
how
enforce
it
my
friend
that
another
matter
i
think
we
have
the
means
to
do
that
said
chayne
we
can
point
out
to
walter
hine
for
instance
that
your
ascent
from
the
brenva
glacier
was
an
attempt
to
murder
him
an
ugly
word
captain
chayne
you
would
find
it
difficult
of
proof
the
story
is
fairly
complete
returned
chayne
there
is
first
of
all
a
telegram
from
jarvice
couched
in
curious
language
garratt
skinner
face
lost
its
smile
of
amusement
indeed
he
said
he
was
plainly
disconcerted
yes
chayne
produced
the
telegram
from
his
letter
case
read
it
aloud
with
his
eyes
upon
garratt
skinner
and
replaced
it
are
you
waiting
for
hurry
up
jarvice
there
is
no
need
at
all
events
to
ask
jarvice
what
he
was
waiting
for
is
there
he
wanted
to
lay
his
hands
upon
the
money
for
which
hine
life
was
insured
garratt
skinner
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
eyes
never
left
face
his
face
grew
set
and
stern
he
had
a
dangerous
look
the
look
of
a
desperate
man
at
bay
then
there
is
a
certain
incident
to
be
considered
which
took
place
in
the
house
near
weymouth
you
must
at
times
have
been
puzzled
by
it
perhaps
a
little
alarmed
too
do
you
remember
one
evening
when
a
whistle
from
the
shadows
on
the
road
and
a
yokel
shout
drove
you
out
of
walter
hine
room
sent
you
creeping
out
of
it
as
stealthily
as
you
entered
nay
did
more
than
that
for
that
whistle
and
that
shout
drove
you
out
of
dorsetshire
ah
i
see
you
remember
garratt
skinner
indeed
had
often
enough
been
troubled
by
the
recollection
of
that
night
the
shout
the
whistle
ringing
out
so
suddenly
and
abruptly
from
the
darkness
and
the
silence
had
struck
upon
his
imagination
and
alarmed
him
by
their
mystery
who
was
the
man
who
had
seen
and
what
had
he
seen
garratt
skinner
had
never
felt
quite
safe
since
that
evening
there
was
some
one
a
stranger
going
about
the
world
with
the
key
to
his
secret
even
if
he
had
not
guessed
the
secret
it
was
i
who
whistled
i
who
shouted
you
cried
garratt
skinner
you
yes
sylvia
was
with
me
you
thought
to
do
that
night
what
you
thought
to
do
a
few
days
ago
above
the
brenva
ridge
both
times
together
we
were
able
to
hinder
you
but
once
sylvia
hindered
you
alone
there
is
the
affair
of
the
cocaine
chayne
looked
toward
his
wife
with
a
look
of
great
pride
for
the
bravery
which
she
had
shown
she
was
sitting
aloof
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
with
her
face
averted
and
a
hand
pressed
over
her
eyes
and
forehead
chayne
looked
back
to
garratt
skinner
and
there
was
more
anger
in
his
face
than
he
had
ever
shown
i
will
never
forgive
you
the
distress
you
have
caused
to
sylvia
he
said
but
garratt
skinner
eyes
were
upon
sylvia
and
in
his
face
too
there
was
a
humorous
look
of
pride
she
had
courage
he
remembered
how
she
had
confronted
him
when
walter
hine
lay
sick
he
said
no
word
to
her
however
and
again
he
turned
to
chayne
who
went
on
there
is
also
your
past
career
to
add
weight
to
the
argument

point
by
point
chayne
set
out
in
detail
the
case
for
the
prosecution
garratt
skinner
listened
without
interruption
but
he
knew
that
he
was
beaten
the
evidence
against
him
was
too
strong
it
might
not
be
enough
legally
to
secure
his
conviction
at
a
public
trial
though
even
upon
that
question
there
would
be
the
gravest
doubt
but
it
would
be
enough
to
carry
certitude
to
every
ear
which
listened
and
to
every
eye
which
read
the
game
is
played
out
chayne
continued
we
have
walter
hine
and
we
shall
not
let
him
slip
back
into
your
hands
how
much
of
the
story
we
shall
tell
him
we
are
not
yet
sure
but
all
if
it
be
necessary
and
if
it
be
necessary
to
others
beside
there
was
a
definite
threat
in
the
last
words
but
garratt
skinner
had
already
made
up
his
mind
since
the
game
was
played
out
since
defeat
had
come
he
took
it
without
anger
or
excuse
very
well
he
said
peace
in
the
family
circle
is
after
all
very
desirable
eh
sylvia
i
agree
with
the
deepest
regret
to
part
from
my
young
friend
walter
hine
i
leave
him
in
your
hands
he
was
speaking
with
a
humorous
magnanimity
but
his
eyes
wandered
back
to
sylvia
who
sat
some
distance
away
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
with
her
face
in
her
hands
and
his
voice
changed
sylvia
he
said
gently
come
here
sylvia
rose
and
walked
over
to
the
table
the
waiting
the
knowledge
which
had
come
to
her
during
the
last
few
days
had
told
their
tale
she
had
the
look
which
chayne
too
well
remembered
the
dark
shadows
beneath
her
eyes
the
languor
in
her
walk
the
pallor
in
her
cheeks
the
distress
and
shame
in
her
expression
sit
down
he
said
and
she
obeyed
him
reluctantly
seating
herself
over
against
him
she
gazed
at
the
with
that
mutinous
look
upon
her
face
which
took
away
from
her
her
womanhood
and
gave
to
her
the
aspect
of
a
pretty
but
resentful
child
garratt
skinner
for
the
life
of
him
could
not
but
smile
at
her
well
sylvia
you
have
beaten
me
you
fought
your
fight
well
and
i
bear
you
no
malice
he
said
lightly
but
and
his
voice
became
serious
again
you
sit
in
judgment
on
me
sylvia
raised
her
eyes
quickly
no
she
cried
i
think
so
he
persisted
i
do
blame
you
only
i
should
like
you
to
bear
this
in
mind
that
you
have
in
your
own
life
a
reason
to
go
gently
in
your
judgments
of
other
people
chayne
stepped
forward
as
though
he
would
interfere
but
sylvia
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
checked
him
i
do
think
you
understand
hilary
she
said
quickly
she
turned
to
her
father
and
looked
straight
at
him
with
an
eager
interest
i
wonder
whether
we
are
both
thinking
of
the
same
thing
she
said
curiously
perhaps
replied
her
father
all
your
life
you
have
dreamed
of
running
water
and
sylvia
nodded
her
head
yes
yes
she
said
with
a
peculiar
intentness
the
dream
is
part
of
you
part
of
your
life
for
all
you
know
it
may
have
modified
your
character
yes
said
sylvia
it
is
a
part
of
you
of
which
you
could
not
rid
yourself
if
you
tried
when
you
are
asleep
this
dream
comes
to
you
it
is
as
much
a
part
of
you
as
a
limb
and
again
sylvia
answered
yes
well
you
are
not
responsible
for
it
and
sylvia
leaned
forward
ah
she
said
she
had
been
wondering
whether
it
was
to
this
point
that
he
was
coming
you
know
now
why
you
hear
it
why
it
part
of
you
you
were
born
to
the
sound
of
running
water
in
that
old
house
in
dorsetshire
before
you
were
born
in
the
daytime
and
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
your
mother
heard
it
week
after
week
perhaps
even
when
she
was
asleep
the
sound
rippled
through
her
dreams
thus
you
came
by
it
it
was
born
in
you
yes
she
answered
following
his
argument
step
by
step
very
carefully
but
without
a
sign
of
the
perplexity
which
was
evident
in
hilary
chayne
chayne
stood
a
little
aloof
looking
from
sylvia
face
to
the
face
of
her
father
in
doubt
whither
the
talk
was
leading
sylvia
on
the
other
hand
recognized
each
sentence
which
her
father
spoke
as
the
embodiment
of
a
thought
with
which
she
was
herself
familiar
well
then
here
a
definite
thing
an
influence
most
likely
a
characteristic
most
certainly
and
not
of
your
making
one
out
of
how
many
influences
characteristics
which
are
part
of
you
but
not
of
your
making
but
we
can
lay
our
finger
on
it
well
it
is
a
pleasant
and
a
pretty
quality
this
dream
of
yours
sylvia
yes
a
very
pleasant
one
to
be
born
with
but
suppose
that
instead
of
that
dream
you
had
been
born
with
a
vice
an
instinct
of
crime
of
sin
would
you
have
been
any
the
more
responsible
for
it
if
you
are
not
responsible
for
the
good
thing
are
you
responsible
for
the
bad
an
awkward
question
sylvia
awkward
enough
to
teach
you
to
go
warily
in
your
judgments
yes
said
sylvia
i
was
amongst
the
fortunate
i
do
deny
it
but
that
not
all
and
as
chayne
moved
restively
garratt
skinner
waved
an
indulgent
hand
i
do
expect
you
captain
chayne
to
take
an
interest
in
these
problems
for
a
military
man
discipline
and
the
penal
code
are
the
obvious
unalterable
solutions
but
it
is
possible
that
i
may
never
see
my
daughter
again
and
i
am
speaking
to
her
and
he
went
back
to
the
old
vexed
question
it
not
only
that
you
are
born
with
qualities
definite
characteristics
definite
cravings
for
which
you
are
no
more
responsible
than
the
man
in
the
moon
and
which
are
part
of
you
but
something
else
how
much
of
your
character
how
much
of
all
your
life
to
come
is
decided
for
you
during
the
first
ten
or
fifteen
years
of
your
life
decided
for
you
mind
not
by
you
upon
my
soul
i
think
the
whole
of
it
you
do
agree
well
it
an
open
question
i
believe
that
at
the
age
of
fifteen
the
lines
along
which
you
will
move
are
already
drawn
your
character
formed
your
conduct
for
the
future
a
settled
thing
to
that
sylvia
gave
no
assent
but
she
did
not
disagree
she
only
looked
at
her
father
with
a
questioning
and
a
troubled
face
if
it
were
so
she
asked
why
had
she
hated
from
the
first
the
circle
in
which
her
mother
and
herself
had
moved
and
the
answer
or
at
all
events
answer
came
as
she
put
the
question
to
herself
she
had
lived
amongst
her
dreams
she
was
in
doubt
well
hear
something
of
my
boyhood
sylvia
cried
her
father
and
for
the
first
time
his
voice
became
embittered
i
was
brought
up
by
a
respectable
father
yes
respectable
he
said
with
a
sneer
everything
about
us
was
respectable
we
lived
in
a
respectable
house
in
a
respectable
neighborhood
and
twice
every
sunday
we
went
to
church
and
listened
to
a
respectable
clergyman
but
well
here
a
chapter
out
of
the
inside
i
would
go
to
bed
and
read
in
bed
by
a
candle
not
a
very
heinous
offence
but
contrary
to
the
rule
of
the
house
sooner
or
later
i
would
hear
a
faint
scuffling
sound
in
the
passage
that
was
my
father
stealing
secretly
along
to
listen
at
my
door
and
see
what
i
was
doing
i
covered
the
light
of
the
candle
with
my
hand
or
perhaps
blew
it
out
but
not
so
quickly
but
that
he
would
see
the
streak
of
light
beneath
the
door
then
the
play
would
begin
are
not
reading
in
bed
are
you
he
would
say
not
i
would
reply
are
sure
he
would
insist
course
father
i
would
answer
then
back
he
would
go
but
only
for
a
little
way
and
i
would
hear
him
come
stealthily
scuffling
back
again
perhaps
the
candle
would
be
lit
again
already
or
at
all
events
uncovered
would
he
say
anything
oh
no
he
had
found
out
i
was
lying
he
felt
that
he
had
scored
a
point
and
he
would
save
it
up
so
we
would
meet
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
he
knowing
that
i
was
a
liar
i
knowing
that
he
knew
that
i
was
a
liar
and
both
pretending
that
we
were
all
in
all
to
each
other
a
small
thing
sylvia
but
crowd
your
life
with
such
small
things
spying
and
deceit
and
a
game
of
played
by
the
father
and
son
my
letters
were
read
i
used
to
know
for
roundabout
questions
would
be
put
leading
up
to
the
elucidation
of
a
sentence
which
to
any
one
but
myself
would
be
obscure
do
you
think
any
child
could
grow
up
straight
if
his
boyhood
passed
in
that
atmosphere
of
trickery
i
do
know
only
i
think
that
before
i
was
fifteen
my
way
of
life
was
a
sure
and
settled
thing
it
was
certain
that
i
should
develop
upon
the
lines
on
which
i
was
trained
garratt
skinner
rose
from
his
seat
there
i
have
done
he
said
he
looked
at
his
daughter
for
a
little
while
his
eyes
dwelling
upon
her
beauty
with
a
certain
pleasure
and
even
a
certain
wistfulness
he
looked
at
her
now
much
as
she
had
been
wont
to
look
at
him
in
the
early
days
of
the
house
in
dorsetshire
it
was
very
plain
that
they
were
father
and
daughter
you
are
too
good
for
your
military
man
my
dear
he
said
with
a
smile
too
pretty
and
too
good
do
you
let
him
forget
it
and
suddenly
he
cried
out
with
a
burst
of
passion
i
wish
to
god
you
had
never
come
near
me
and
sylvia
hearing
the
cry
remembered
that
on
the
sunday
evening
when
she
had
first
come
to
the
house
in
hobart
place
her
father
had
shown
a
particular
hesitation
had
felt
some
of
that
remorse
of
which
she
heard
the
full
expression
now
in
welcoming
her
to
his
house
and
adapting
her
to
his
ends
she
raised
her
downcast
eyes
and
with
outstretched
hands
took
a
step
forward
father
she
said
but
her
father
was
already
gone
she
heard
his
step
upon
the
stairs
chayne
however
followed
her
father
from
the
room
and
caught
him
up
as
he
was
leaving
the
hotel
i
want
to
say
he
began
with
some
difficulty
that
if
you
are
pressed
at
all
for
money
garratt
skinner
stopped
him
he
pulled
some
sovereigns
out
of
one
pocket
and
some
banknotes
out
of
another
you
see
i
have
enough
to
go
on
with
in
fact
and
he
looked
northward
toward
the
mountains
dimly
they
could
be
seen
under
the
sickle
of
a
new
moon
in
fact
i
propose
to
take
your
friend
simond
and
cross
on
the
to
zermatt
but
afterward
asked
chayne
garratt
skinner
laughed
and
laughed
like
a
boy
there
was
a
rich
anticipation
of
enjoyment
in
the
sound
afterward
i
shall
have
a
great
time
i
shall
squeeze
jarvice
what
they
call
in
america
a
cinch
and
with
a
cheery
garratt
skinner
betook
himself
down
the
road
