chapter
i
fun
at
the
grange
yes
indeed
said
patty
pleasantly
and
then
a
hat
with
ribbons
from
the
edge
of
the
brim
tied
under
my
chin
or
perhaps
chiffon
ties
which
would
you
have
patty
yes
indeed
said
patty
in
a
voice
of
enthusiasm
but
not
looking
up
from
her
book
oh
patty
you
silly
now
listen
look
at
these
plates
and
pick
out
the
prettiest
hat
so
i
may
get
it
for
the
lady
kitty
spread
out
the
sheets
of
millinery
designs
and
still
absorbed
in
her
reading
patty
lifted
her
hand
and
without
looking
pointed
a
finger
at
random
till
it
rested
on
one
of
the
pictured
hats
that
one
why
patty
you
re
crazy
i
couldn
t
wear
that
pudgy
little
turban
i
want
a
big
would
you
have
a
straw
or
lace
yes
indeed
said
patty
turning
a
leaf
and
devouring
the
next
page
of
her
book
angel
child
you
think
you
re
teasing
me
don
t
you
but
not
so
i
love
to
see
you
so
bent
on
literary
pursuits
indeed
i
don
t
think
one
book
at
a
time
is
enough
for
a
great
brain
like
yours
you
should
have
two
at
once
you
go
on
with
yours
and
i
ll
read
another
to
picking
up
a
book
from
a
rustic
couch
near
by
lady
kitty
began
to
read
aloud
her
reading
was
more
dramatic
than
the
text
warranted
and
besides
much
elocutionary
effect
she
gesticulated
vigorously
and
finally
rose
and
standing
straight
in
front
of
patty
kept
on
reading
and
declaiming
in
ludicrous
style
the
two
were
under
a
large
marquee
on
the
lawn
of
markleham
grange
the
country
home
of
lady
hamilton
and
her
father
sir
otho
patty
was
comfortably
tucked
up
among
the
cushions
of
a
lengthy
wicker
chair
and
had
elected
to
spend
the
morning
reading
a
new
of
the
very
kind
she
liked
best
so
partly
because
she
didn
t
want
to
be
disturbed
but
more
for
the
sake
of
mischievously
teasing
her
friend
patty
pretended
to
be
oblivious
to
the
hat
subject
but
she
could
not
long
keep
a
straight
face
while
kitty
waved
her
arms
and
trilled
her
voice
in
ridiculous
fashion
as
she
continued
to
read
aloud
from
the
book
then
she
would
drop
into
a
monotonous
drawl
then
gallop
ahead
without
emphasis
or
inflection
and
sometimes
she
would
chant
the
words
in
dramatic
recitative
of
course
while
this
went
on
patty
couldn
t
read
her
own
book
so
finding
herself
beaten
at
her
own
game
of
teasing
she
closed
the
volume
and
said
quietly
i
wish
you
d
let
me
advise
you
about
that
new
hat
you
re
thinking
of
buying
you
always
selects
such
as
lady
hamilton
s
hats
were
renowned
for
their
beauty
and
variety
this
speech
was
taken
at
its
worth
and
in
a
moment
the
two
friends
were
earnestly
discussing
the
respective
merits
of
chiffon
lace
and
straw
as
protection
against
the
rays
of
a
sun
it
was
the
latter
part
of
a
lovely
morning
in
the
latter
part
of
a
lovely
august
patty
had
drifted
through
the
summer
making
and
unmaking
plans
continuously
in
her
efforts
to
secure
the
greatest
good
to
the
greatest
number
of
her
family
and
friends
she
had
not
joined
her
parents
in
switzerland
as
she
had
thought
to
do
for
invitations
to
various
english
had
seemed
more
attractive
and
after
a
round
of
such
parties
patty
had
come
to
markleham
grange
for
the
double
purpose
of
having
a
few
quiet
weeks
and
of
being
with
her
adored
friend
lady
kitty
the
grange
was
a
typical
country
home
with
all
the
appurtenances
of
terraces
gardens
woodlands
and
hunting
preserves
in
the
great
rambling
house
guests
came
and
went
and
patty
greatly
enjoyed
the
personal
freedom
that
prevailed
though
occupations
and
amusements
of
all
sorts
were
provided
no
social
obligations
were
exacted
until
afternoon
tea
time
at
five
however
everybody
assembled
on
the
lawn
or
if
rainy
in
sir
otho
s
and
the
host
himself
accepted
the
attention
and
companionship
of
his
guests
dinner
too
was
rather
formal
and
there
was
always
pleasant
entertainment
in
the
evening
but
it
seemed
to
patty
that
she
liked
the
mornings
best
she
strolled
often
all
by
herself
through
the
woods
and
parks
she
chatted
with
the
old
gardener
about
the
rare
and
beautiful
flowers
she
played
with
the
pet
fawns
or
idly
drifted
about
the
lake
in
a
small
rowboat
sometimes
she
met
sir
otho
on
her
morning
rambles
and
for
a
time
they
would
chat
together
the
old
gentleman
had
a
decided
liking
for
patty
and
though
he
was
an
opinionated
man
and
dictatorial
of
speech
the
girl
s
innate
tactfulness
kept
her
from
rousing
his
contradictory
spirit
and
they
were
most
amiable
friends
but
perhaps
best
of
all
patty
liked
the
mornings
when
boxes
of
new
books
arrived
from
london
selecting
an
interesting
story
she
would
make
a
for
her
favourite
this
was
a
large
affair
canopied
but
without
sides
and
furnished
with
wicker
chairs
tables
and
lounges
soft
rugs
covered
the
ground
and
the
view
was
across
a
small
lake
dotted
with
tiny
flowery
islands
to
glorious
green
woodlands
beyond
here
patty
would
read
and
dream
until
the
all
too
short
morning
had
flown
away
and
a
servant
or
lady
kitty
herself
would
come
to
summon
her
to
luncheon
and
it
was
here
that
lady
kitty
came
with
her
sheets
of
new
hat
designs
just
up
from
london
when
teasing
patty
declined
to
be
interested
but
having
at
last
thrown
herself
into
the
discussion
it
proved
to
be
an
animated
one
and
ended
by
lady
kitty
s
return
to
the
house
to
send
an
order
for
hats
for
both
of
them
patty
remained
in
her
lounging
chair
but
did
not
immediately
resume
her
book
her
thoughts
flew
back
to
kitty
s
ridiculous
antics
as
she
read
aloud
to
tease
patty
then
her
gaze
wandered
out
to
the
lake
and
she
watched
a
flock
of
ducklings
who
were
enthusiastically
paddling
along
by
the
side
of
their
more
sedate
mother
such
funny
blundering
little
balls
of
down
they
were
and
when
one
of
them
nearly
turned
a
somersault
in
its
efforts
to
swim
gracefully
patty
laughed
aloud
at
him
do
it
again
said
a
low
but
commanding
voice
at
her
side
and
patty
looked
round
to
see
a
young
man
seated
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
she
had
not
heard
him
approach
and
she
stared
at
him
with
a
pardonable
curiosity
he
was
garbed
in
white
flannels
with
a
soft
white
silk
shirt
and
windsor
tie
though
most
correct
in
manner
and
bearing
he
yet
had
an
informal
effect
and
his
large
dark
eyes
looked
almost
mournfully
at
patty
i
said
do
it
again
he
repeated
in
a
slightly
aggrieved
tone
do
what
again
said
patty
more
astonished
than
offended
make
that
funny
noise
something
like
a
laugh
it
a
laugh
why
yes
one
of
my
very
best
ones
didn
t
you
like
it
i
thought
it
was
a
chime
of
fairy
bells
was
the
reply
so
fervently
given
that
patty
laughed
again
the
young
man
solemnly
bowed
as
if
in
acknowledgment
of
her
kindness
don
t
take
it
so
hard
she
said
smiling
you
ll
get
over
it
you
ll
be
all
right
in
a
i
m
all
right
now
thank
you
i
get
used
to
things
very
quickly
and
by
the
way
you
don
t
mind
my
talking
to
you
without
having
been
properly
introduced
i
i
do
mind
very
much
i
think
you
re
forward
and
unconventional
and
i
hate
both
those
you
re
so
direct
now
a
softer
subtler
insinuation
would
have
pleased
me
but
i
m
not
trying
to
please
you
no
you
really
ought
to
study
to
the
young
man
arose
and
looked
at
patty
with
an
air
of
calm
impersonal
criticism
it
would
suit
your
personal
appearance
so
indeed
what
my
personal
appearance
ah
direct
and
curious
both
well
your
beauty
is
of
the
sort
described
in
most
novels
as
not
a
classic
face
or
even
but
with
that
indescribable
charm
indeed
i
ve
been
told
that
my
features
were
very
ridiculous
nonsense
why
your
eyes
are
too
large
for
your
face
your
hair
is
too
heavy
for
your
head
and
and
your
hands
are
too
little
for
anything
how
rude
you
are
said
patty
shaking
with
laughter
but
as
i
brought
it
on
myself
i
suppose
i
oughtn
t
to
complain
now
let
s
drop
personalities
and
talk
awfully
mean
of
you
before
i
had
my
innings
however
i
don
t
care
let
s
it
s
a
fine
morning
isn
t
it
are
you
always
so
funny
asked
patty
staring
at
the
young
man
like
a
child
pleased
with
a
new
toy
most
always
was
the
cheerful
retort
aren
t
you
now
you
re
rude
again
and
i
must
ask
you
to
go
away
but
tell
me
your
name
before
you
go
so
that
i
may
avoid
you
in
what
a
good
plan
my
name
on
the
grampian
hills
is
floyd
austin
and
truly
i
m
well
worth
knowing
this
performance
this
morning
is
just
an
escapade
into
each
life
some
escapades
must
fall
you
know
and
by
the
way
if
you
ll
disentangle
your
eyes
from
my
gaze
just
for
a
minute
and
look
the
other
way
you
ll
see
the
august
sir
otho
coming
with
bless
you
my
children
written
legibly
in
every
line
of
his
shining
morning
sir
otho
came
toward
them
with
hearty
greetings
well
well
patty
he
said
so
you
already
know
our
friend
austin
that
s
good
that
s
good
but
you
must
be
afraid
of
him
for
he
s
one
of
our
coming
poets
he
s
already
a
celebrity
you
are
you
a
celebrity
demanded
patty
turning
to
floyd
austin
i
am
he
said
gravely
why
why
are
you
one
to
pay
a
bet
austin
replied
so
promptly
that
his
two
hearers
laughed
he
s
crazy
said
patty
to
sir
otho
i
never
heard
such
talk
he
s
a
humorist
my
dear
child
you
don
t
know
his
a
humorist
said
patty
turning
to
austin
with
simple
inquiry
on
her
pretty
face
i
thought
you
were
a
austin
flashed
an
amused
look
at
sir
otho
and
then
looking
at
patty
he
said
in
a
smooth
even
voice
the
force
of
nature
could
no
further
go
to
make
myself
she
joined
the
other
i
do
understand
your
language
cried
patty
gaily
that
s
in
bartlett
and
it
says
under
milton
s
picture
oh
my
dear
patty
said
sir
otho
is
your
poetical
knowledge
bounded
by
bartlett
but
sir
otho
observed
floyd
austin
in
his
slow
quiet
way
bartlett
is
not
such
a
bad
boundary
his
book
is
like
a
bird
view
of
a
city
which
is
always
a
good
thing
for
one
can
then
pick
out
the
churches
and
monuments
so
yes
and
one
can
miss
the
most
interesting
bits
that
lurk
in
narrow
streets
and
obscure
true
enough
and
so
we
both
have
the
best
of
the
floyd
austin
was
a
popular
favourite
and
one
of
the
explanations
of
his
popularity
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
rarely
continued
to
disagree
with
any
one
the
discomfiture
of
another
which
is
so
pleasing
to
some
clever
people
was
positively
painful
to
his
sensitive
nature
and
so
easily
adaptable
were
his
own
opinions
that
he
could
adjust
them
to
suit
those
of
another
with
no
trouble
at
all
this
made
his
character
somewhat
indefinite
but
added
to
the
charm
of
his
personality
and
his
sunny
good
nature
was
a
quick
passport
to
the
good
will
of
a
new
acquaintance
one
of
austin
s
minor
interests
was
harmony
of
colour
he
looked
at
patty
as
she
stood
leaning
lightly
against
the
back
of
the
chair
from
which
she
had
risen
at
sir
otho
s
approach
she
wore
a
long
summer
cloak
of
a
light
silk
lined
with
another
silk
that
was
pink
like
a
seashell
simply
cut
the
long
full
folds
almost
hid
her
white
frock
and
she
gathered
the
yielding
material
about
her
with
a
graceful
gesture
how
well
you
wear
that
cape
miss
fairfield
said
floyd
and
then
turning
to
sir
otho
he
asked
doesn
t
she
why
yes
i
daresay
said
the
older
man
uncertainly
do
you
patty
i
don
t
know
said
the
girl
laughing
i
hope
so
i
m
sure
for
it
s
one
of
my
favourite
wraps
are
you
an
artist
austin
that
you
re
so
observant
i
m
an
artist
in
most
ways
yes
he
replied
and
i
love
colour
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
those
two
shades
in
your
cloak
now
are
like
like
coffee
and
strawberry
ice
cream
put
in
saucy
patty
and
young
austin
agreed
enthusiastically
just
that
he
cried
and
surely
there
s
no
better
i
like
lemon
myself
began
sir
otho
and
just
then
lady
hamilton
came
trailing
her
soft
frills
across
the
lawn
toward
the
group
floyd
austin
by
all
that
s
wonderful
she
exclaimed
as
she
held
out
both
hands
to
the
young
man
and
smiled
a
welcome
yes
lady
kitty
he
said
taking
her
hands
and
smiling
an
acceptance
of
her
welcome
and
so
glad
to
see
you
is
austin
a
brother
asked
patty
and
if
so
why
have
i
never
heard
of
him
before
yes
he
s
a
brother
of
all
the
world
said
kitty
the
very
dearest
boy
ever
i
believe
he
lives
next
door
to
us
but
he
s
never
there
for
when
he
s
there
he
s
always
here
oh
is
he
irish
said
patty
and
floyd
austin
s
eyes
twinkled
at
her
quick
repartee
he
s
cosmopolitan
said
sir
otho
lives
all
over
the
world
but
he
s
a
dear
vagabond
and
as
long
as
we
can
keep
him
here
we
re
going
to
do
not
long
said
austin
shaking
his
head
i
m
just
down
for
a
whiffling
trip
and
then
off
again
to
a
summer
oh
you
can
change
your
plans
said
lady
kitty
easily
i
ve
known
you
to
do
it
before
and
i
m
sure
i
can
persuade
you
now
for
i
ve
miss
fairfield
to
help
me
coax
oh
i
m
no
good
at
coaxing
said
saucy
patty
who
was
not
yet
quite
sure
that
she
liked
this
rather
audacious
young
man
but
i
ll
teach
you
how
to
coax
prettily
he
said
and
then
when
you
learn
you
can
coax
me
to
do
anything
and
i
ll
allow
myself
to
be
allow
yourself
indeed
said
patty
probably
you
won
t
be
able
to
help
yourself
probably
not
he
responded
with
his
unfailing
concurrence
chapter
ii
a
summons
home
afternoon
tea
was
in
progress
and
as
a
light
rain
had
set
in
it
was
being
served
in
the
this
large
apartment
was
very
attractive
for
aside
from
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended
it
was
admirably
adapted
for
a
cosy
a
sort
of
extension
with
roof
and
sides
of
stained
glass
was
an
ideal
place
for
the
and
its
many
appurtenances
and
except
for
the
footman
who
brought
in
fresh
supplies
lady
kitty
and
her
guests
waited
upon
themselves
though
never
a
large
group
a
few
neighbours
usually
dropped
in
at
and
as
there
were
always
some
people
staying
in
the
house
the
hour
was
a
social
one
patty
looking
very
dainty
in
a
pretty
little
of
dresden
silk
was
having
a
very
good
time
flo
carrington
a
young
english
girl
whom
she
had
met
only
the
day
before
came
bustling
in
with
exclamations
of
dismay
i
m
nearly
drowned
she
cried
the
pelting
rain
has
ruined
me
frock
and
i
m
starving
for
me
tea
do
give
me
some
dear
lady
you
shall
have
it
at
once
declared
patty
hovering
around
the
tea
things
cream
or
lemon
lemon
and
two
lumps
you
pretty
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
again
i
ve
only
known
you
hours
but
already
i
feel
if
you
re
not
by
me
sit
down
and
let
s
indulge
in
pleasant
so
with
their
teacups
the
girls
sat
down
and
being
largely
about
their
two
selves
the
conversation
was
very
pleasant
indeed
but
soon
they
were
interrupted
as
cadwalader
oram
a
typical
young
englishman
approached
them
you
two
young
women
have
monopolised
each
other
long
enough
he
declared
you
must
now
endeavour
to
entertain
that
s
easy
said
patty
and
turning
to
a
she
took
a
plate
of
hot
buttered
ones
and
offered
them
to
young
oram
have
a
muffin
indeed
i
will
they
re
very
entertaining
have
you
ever
noticed
how
wonderful
the
markleham
muffins
are
i
get
such
nowhere
else
why
is
that
i
wonder
lady
kitty
who
was
waiting
by
answered
this
herself
because
at
large
and
formal
teas
she
said
muffins
are
not
served
and
if
one
s
friends
drop
in
unexpectedly
muffins
are
rarely
ready
it
is
my
aim
in
life
to
have
just
so
many
people
to
tea
as
will
justify
muffins
without
prohibiting
at
last
i
understand
why
the
teas
at
this
house
are
always
perfection
said
oram
rising
for
a
moment
as
lady
kitty
moved
away
a
newcomer
had
arrived
and
patty
looking
up
saw
floyd
austin
s
grave
face
in
the
doorway
owing
to
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
the
starving
people
gathered
in
the
to
partake
of
that
nourishment
which
was
to
keep
them
alive
until
the
dinner
he
said
this
in
an
impersonal
sort
of
voice
which
seemed
to
patty
extremely
funny
he
s
always
doing
that
said
flo
carrington
sometimes
he
s
screamingly
after
greeting
his
hostess
austin
made
his
way
toward
the
small
group
clustered
round
patty
with
much
chat
and
banter
he
was
served
with
tea
and
muffins
and
so
much
attention
was
shown
him
that
patty
concluded
he
must
be
a
favourite
indeed
i
fear
we
have
rudely
run
into
a
cloudburst
or
something
remarked
cadwalader
oram
unsuccessfully
trying
to
look
through
a
window
whose
stained
glass
was
further
obscured
by
slipping
raindrops
sit
down
caddy
said
flo
you
mar
the
harmony
of
this
meeting
when
you
re
so
being
thus
admonished
young
oram
crumpled
himself
gracefully
into
a
chair
drawled
floyd
austin
as
oram
did
that
very
thing
and
patty
s
laughter
rang
out
at
the
apt
description
do
that
again
said
austin
looking
gravely
at
patty
but
she
only
smiled
saucily
at
him
and
looked
over
his
head
at
another
man
who
was
approaching
mayn
t
i
be
invited
to
join
this
group
if
the
speaker
s
voice
betokened
a
confidence
in
his
own
welcome
it
was
not
misplaced
for
smiles
of
greeting
were
bestowed
on
him
and
flo
carrington
moved
to
make
room
for
him
between
herself
and
patty
on
the
great
settle
striving
to
act
as
if
a
literary
lion
were
an
everyday
occurrence
the
ladies
beamed
graciously
upon
him
droned
austin
and
so
pat
was
his
allusion
that
they
all
laughed
this
is
peter
homer
miss
fairfield
said
flo
and
austin
added
beyond
all
doubt
the
most
outrageously
interesting
man
you
have
ever
just
queer
enough
to
be
delightful
put
in
cadwalader
oram
and
homer
smiled
benignly
at
the
chaff
flung
at
him
he
isn
t
queer
at
all
declared
flo
he
s
a
genius
and
a
thoroughly
sensible
both
impossible
exclaimed
floyd
austin
not
at
all
said
homer
himself
i
m
writing
a
book
in
twenty
volumes
miss
fairfield
that
proves
my
genius
and
i
ve
left
my
work
to
come
and
chum
with
my
friends
that
proves
my
what
is
your
book
about
asked
patty
a
little
uncertain
how
to
talk
to
this
wise
man
tell
me
about
your
how
can
i
talk
to
you
of
work
said
homer
when
you
don
t
even
know
what
the
word
means
have
you
ever
done
any
work
in
your
life
no
admitted
patty
i
m
too
busy
being
idle
to
have
any
time
for
work
my
life
is
nothing
but
but
folly
and
happiness
are
twins
said
he
looking
kindly
at
the
girl
and
when
kindness
shone
in
peter
homer
s
blue
eyes
he
was
indeed
attractive
they
are
agreed
patty
but
pray
how
do
you
know
what
the
word
folly
means
his
folly
is
being
wise
broke
in
cadwalader
oram
good
for
you
caddy
exclaimed
floyd
austin
if
that
didn
t
have
a
vaguely
familiar
ring
about
it
i
should
say
you
d
made
an
well
let
s
say
it
all
the
same
said
flo
carrington
he
may
never
come
any
nearer
to
i
don
t
want
to
returned
oram
stevenson
says
there
s
nothing
so
disenchanting
as
attainment
and
that
s
a
delightful
principle
to
work
on
i
hope
to
goodness
i
shall
always
fail
just
as
i
m
about
to
what
nonsense
cried
patty
then
if
you
ever
ask
a
lovely
girl
to
marry
you
you
ll
be
secretly
hoping
she
ll
say
no
my
word
but
americans
are
clever
said
oram
bowing
to
her
but
for
the
sake
of
my
argument
i
must
even
subscribe
to
oh
pshaw
caddy
said
homer
don
t
worry
over
it
you
know
you
re
a
younger
son
and
very
few
girls
would
marry
you
very
few
would
be
enough
observed
cadwalader
quickly
and
floyd
austin
immediately
chimed
in
having
neatly
vanquished
his
opponent
the
younger
son
chuckled
softly
to
then
as
lady
kitty
came
and
took
homer
away
the
little
group
broke
up
and
somehow
patty
found
herself
talking
to
floyd
austin
say
some
more
of
those
funny
things
she
demanded
i
never
heard
any
one
do
that
the
young
man
glanced
furtively
at
his
watch
and
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
features
as
he
realised
he
must
say
adieu
to
the
fair
young
girl
before
austin
said
this
in
a
whimsical
tone
and
patty
laughed
aloud
in
spite
of
herself
thank
you
he
said
earnestly
for
his
admiration
of
her
musical
laugh
was
now
a
standing
joke
between
them
and
by
the
way
there
s
a
dance
at
three
towers
night
i
suppose
you
ll
go
will
you
give
me
all
the
dances
just
for
luck
you
all
the
odd
numbers
why
i
never
heard
of
such
greediness
i
ll
give
you
just
one
dance
and
you
may
be
thankful
if
you
get
all
of
it
somehow
i
can
t
feel
alarmed
for
i
know
you
ll
change
your
mind
a
dozen
times
before
night
how
well
you
read
me
but
truly
i
can
t
help
it
i
always
fraction
up
my
dances
and
they
won
t
come
out
even
and
then
i
have
to
tear
up
my
programme
and
then
of
course
i
can
t
remember
who
s
who
in
the
who
s
hoodooed
in
the
ballroom
you
mean
but
after
that
programme
s
torn
up
i
may
fare
better
than
in
the
face
of
its
accusing
tell
me
something
about
homer
said
patty
as
she
looked
at
the
tall
man
who
was
the
centre
of
an
admiring
group
peter
homer
well
he
s
the
rightest
kind
of
a
fellow
a
great
scholar
and
the
man
i
ever
saw
outside
my
own
do
you
think
you
re
pretty
asked
patty
looking
at
him
with
an
air
of
innocent
inquiry
yes
indeed
not
as
pretty
as
you
are
of
course
but
still
a
beauty
but
homer
has
the
noble
brow
and
lantern
jaws
that
go
to
make
up
the
ideal
of
facial
elegance
isn
t
his
hair
stunning
homer
s
hair
was
black
and
abundant
it
was
somewhat
bushy
and
of
coarse
texture
and
was
tossed
over
back
as
if
by
the
incessant
pushings
of
an
impatient
hand
you
ll
like
him
austin
went
on
but
you
won
t
understand
or
appreciate
him
you
re
too
young
and
thank
you
said
patty
not
at
all
don
t
mention
it
no
trouble
i
assure
you
but
homer
s
a
i
m
specially
good
at
ah
but
he
isn
t
of
the
transposed
i
am
a
fish
variety
you
never
can
solve
peter
homer
little
i
ve
no
desire
to
said
patty
a
little
chagrined
at
his
superior
tone
he
isn
t
a
prize
puzzle
is
he
with
the
native
quickness
of
the
young
american
she
gracefully
took
the
wind
out
of
the
sails
of
the
conversation
piped
austin
as
he
looked
at
her
admiringly
just
then
a
footman
brought
a
telegram
to
patty
i
brought
it
at
once
ma
am
he
said
if
so
there
might
be
an
answer
the
man
will
wait
a
allow
me
said
austin
slitting
the
envelope
for
her
and
i
ll
stand
in
front
of
you
while
you
read
it
lest
it
may
be
of
dire
import
and
your
emotion
be
exposed
to
the
gaping
patty
smiled
at
his
nonsense
and
read
the
telegram
last
call
no
more
postponements
we
will
come
for
you
next
week
and
all
start
for
home
september
first
be
ready
oh
cried
patty
in
surprised
dismay
as
she
grasped
the
sense
of
the
message
can
i
help
said
austin
quite
serious
now
for
he
saw
patty
was
really
agitated
no
it
s
nothing
tragic
at
least
not
really
so
but
it
seems
so
to
me
i
have
to
go
home
that
s
home
to
america
yes
and
of
course
i
m
glad
to
go
in
some
ways
but
i
wanted
to
stay
over
here
a
little
longer
through
the
autumn
it
s
a
beastly
pity
i
don
t
want
you
to
go
who
says
you
must
my
father
said
patty
i
ve
been
promising
to
join
him
all
summer
but
somehow
i
didn
t
get
off
and
now
he
suddenly
says
we
re
all
to
go
all
yes
father
and
nan
and
me
nan
s
my
dear
little
stepmother
she
s
the
sweetest
thing
i
just
love
her
i
m
really
crazy
to
see
them
both
again
but
i
don
t
want
to
go
back
to
new
york
quite
yet
i
ll
soon
get
used
to
the
idea
but
coming
just
now
it
s
a
it
is
to
me
i
assure
you
why
we
re
just
beginning
to
be
yes
i
shall
always
remember
you
patty
was
really
thinking
of
something
else
and
said
this
so
perfunctorily
that
floyd
austin
drawled
out
having
made
a
polite
speech
the
young
lady
promptly
forgot
the
very
presence
of
the
gentleman
who
was
addressing
nonsense
said
patty
laughing
there
i
ll
put
this
rather
disturbing
telegram
away
for
the
present
and
devote
my
attention
entirely
to
you
heaven
be
praised
murmured
austin
rolling
his
melancholy
eyes
toward
the
ceiling
but
oughtn
t
you
to
answer
it
you
know
the
henchman
oh
yes
well
i
ll
scribble
a
turning
to
a
desk
patty
quickly
wrote
all
right
come
on
i
ll
be
then
addressing
it
and
signing
it
she
gave
it
to
floyd
who
went
in
search
of
a
footman
after
the
tea
guests
had
all
gone
patty
went
to
lady
kitty
s
room
to
tell
her
the
news
wake
up
said
patty
gently
dropping
a
kiss
on
the
closed
eyes
of
her
friend
who
was
resting
a
bit
before
dinner
what
for
asked
kitty
not
opening
her
eyes
what
for
indeed
to
see
the
last
of
your
friend
and
partner
eyes
gaze
your
last
heart
breathe
your
fond
farewells
the
big
blue
eyes
of
kitty
hamilton
slowly
unclosed
themselves
melodramatics
my
dear
she
said
what
do
they
mean
read
that
said
patty
handing
her
the
telegram
kitty
read
it
twice
and
then
sat
up
wide
awake
enough
now
my
little
pattypat
she
said
you
can
t
go
away
home
to
america
i
won
t
let
you
you
can
t
help
yourself
kitsie
if
father
has
made
up
his
mind
and
it
does
sound
so
off
we
they
re
coming
here
next
week

on
kitty
musing
over
the
telegram
that
part
of
it
s
delightful
i
ll
make
it
so
pleasant
for
them
that
they
can
t
tear
themselves
you

t
do
that

but
it

be
fun
to
see
them

lot

do
believe
you

glad

ways

adaptable

sailing

sea
i

lots
of

kitty

at
any
rate
don
t
let
this
summons
cloud
your
bright
young
life
for
the
moment
lock
it
up
in
your
desk

of
your
mind

a
few
nobody
very
especial
put
on
that
speckled
gauze
don
t
you
call
my
dotted
chiffon
by
disrespectful
names
and
patty
ran
singing
away
to
her
own
room
chapter
iii
a
pleasure
trip
offered
kitty
i
ve
had
a
jounce
said
patty
next
day
as
she
sought
her
friend
and
found
her
in
the
pleasant
morning
room
that
overlooked
the
lady
hamilton
treated
her
young
guest
to
a
haughty
disdainful
stare
if
you
will
talk
in
barbaric
jargon
she
said
you
can
t
expected
civilised
people
to
understand
patty
had
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
and
as
she
fell
sideways
into
a
big
she
gave
her
hostess
a
dear
little
smile
of
apology
it
is
horrid
i
know
she
said
contritely
i
don
t
know
why
the
excessively
correct
and
atmosphere
of
markleham
grange
should
bring
out
my
worst
american
slang
but
it
does
i
beg
your
pardon
kitty
and
i
ll
try
to
mend
my
oh
don
t
take
it
too
seriously
laughed
lady
kitty
and
now
what
you
well
you
may
remember
i
had
a
telegram
yesterday
from
my
adored
parent
telling
me
i
was
to
start
for
home
the
first
of
i
remember
it
with
startling
well
forget
it
then
for
it
isn
t
true
one
of
the
clever
operators
of
your
clever
british
telegraph
company
must
have
misread
or
miswritten
a
word
for
i
have
a
letter
here
from
my
father
and
it
seems
he
wrote
instead
of
oh
patty
fairfield
and
aren
t
you
really
going
home
at
all
and
are
you
going
to
rome
to
italy
yes
just
that
father
and
nan
have
suddenly
decided
to
spend
the
autumn
in
italy
a
pleasure
trip
you
know
and
go
straight
to
rome
first
and
then
go
home
later
about
christmas
they
well
i
don
t
wonder
you
were
what
did
you
call
it
bumped
no
i
didn
t
say
that
i
merely
announced
that
i
was
ahem
surprised
a
and
pleased
yes
very
much
pleased
i
didn
t
care
a
lot
about
switzerland
but
i
m
crazy
to
go
to
rome
and
venice
and
some
few
other
italian
indeed
it
will
be
a
pleasure
trip
for
well
it

t
leave

of
course
but
father
and
i
will
run
down
to
see
you
later
wherever
you
are
i
need
a
little
southern
sun
on
my
nothing

improve
your
complexion
said
patty
kissing
it
but
it
will
be
great
to
have
you
join
us
i
feel
like
a
whirlpool
it
s
awful
to
have
my
outlook
whipped
about
so
often
and
so
and
you
may
get
a
letter
saying
this
is
a
mistake
and
your
father
is
taking
you
to
indeed
it
isn
t
father
who
s
changeable
it
s
that
bright
telegraph
operator
who
can
t
read
a
gentleman
s
handwriting
well
there
s
no
harm
done
and
now
i
ll
run
away
and
adjust
my
mind
to
my
changed
patty
went
out
to
her
favourite
seat
under
the
awning
and
gave
herself
up
to
day
dreams
of
the
delightful
trip
in
store
for
her
she
had
always
longed
to
go
to
italy
but
had
not
expected
to
do
so
for
many
years
yet
for
some
reason
and
fairfield
had
changed
their
plans
but
though
the
letter
told
of
this
it
told
little
else
no
hanging
back
now
her
father
had
written
no
excuses
of
or
cancel
all
your
engagements
if
you
ve
made
any
and
be
ready
to
leave
markleham
grange
when
we
come
for
you
next
he
needn
t
have
been
so
explicit
thought
patty
for
i
ve
no
desire
to
put
ahead
of
a
trip
to
italy
why
i
wouldn
t
miss
it
for
anything
i
wonder
if
we
will
go
to
venice
i
suppose
i
ought
to
study
up
art
and
things
i
m
fearfully
ignorant
but
i
couldn
t
learn
much
in
a
week
i
guess
i
ll
wait
and
learn
it
on
its
native
heath
perhaps
i
won
t
care
much
for
the
old
statues
and
things
anyway
i
suppose
they
re
awfully
ruined
must
look
like
a
railroad
accident
oh
that
s
horrid
of
me
i
ought
to
have
more
respect
for
such
things
well
i
m
going
anyhow
and
i
ll
have
the
time
of
my
life
i
know
i
patty
lived
through
that
day
somehow
going
to
italy
seemed
a
responsibility
and
one
not
to
be
undertaken
thoughtlessly
she
hinted
this
to
lady
hamilton
and
kitty
laughed
outright
my
word
she
said
don
t
you
think
you
re
going
to
do
the
yankee
tourist
effect
don
t
you
go
pottering
about
the
galleries
with
your
nose
in
a
catalogue
and
a
baedeker
under
your
arm
a
nice
pleasure
trip
that
would
be
you
re
too
ignorant
to
be
an
intelligent
art
lover
and
not
ignorant
enough
to
pose
as
one
just
stumble
around
among
the
pictures
and
much
of
what
is
good
will
stick
to
your
memory
and
the
rest
will
brush
off
of
you
re
a
comfort
kitty
said
patty
i
thought
i
ought
to
study
up
ruskin
on
the
tuscans
and
etruscans
or
whatever
those
art
books
are
you
re
too
much
of
a
goose
patty
to
study
anything
but
i
expect
you
ll
get
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
i
rayther
think
i
shall
said
patty
with
twinkling
eyes
for
as
she
well
knew
she
found
fun
wherever
she
looked
for
it
that
night
they
went
to
the
dance
at
three
towers
this
was
a
neighbouring
country
place
whose
three
noble
towers
ranked
among
the
oldest
in
england
patty
was
enchanted
with
the
grand
old
house
for
her
delvings
into
architectural
books
through
the
summer
had
taught
her
to
appreciate
historic
mansions
patty
almost
held
her
breath
as
she
entered
the
stately
ballroom
with
its
crystal
chandeliers
like
suspended
frozen
fountains
sparkling
with
hundreds
of
wax
candles
the
floral
decorations
were
elaborate
but
to
patty
s
mind
they
almost
detracted
from
the
grandeur
of
the
massive
beams
and
studded
ceilings
of
the
fine
old
hall
after
greeting
the
hostess
the
markleham
party
found
themselves
surrounded
by
friends
and
acquaintances
and
patty
learned
that
the
dancing
had
already
begun
sir
otho
made
his
escape
to
some
other
room
where
he
might
chat
undisturbed
with
some
of
his
cronies
and
lady
kitty
and
patty
were
soon
provided
with
programmes
and
besieged
for
dances
now
you
done
it
was
floyd
austin
s
comment
as
he
presented
himself
and
gazed
in
frank
admiration
at
patty
s
pretty
evening
gown
of
fluffy
white
tulle
decorated
with
silver
tracery
is
that
the
frock
of
a
hundred
frills
aptly
named
floyd
said
lady
kitty
and
a
becoming
costume
for
my
little
girl
isn
t
it
oh
fair
madame
fair
said
austin
teasingly
i
d
rather
be
asked
to
dance
than
to
have
ambiguous
compliments
said
patty
tapping
her
foot
in
time
to
the
viennese
music
of
the
orchestra
come
then
said
austin
in
a
tone
of
patient
resignation
shall
i
humour
her
lady
kitty
smiling
assent
was
given
and
the
two
joined
the
dancers
on
the
polished
floor
how
different
from
dancing
in
america
said
patty
as
they
wound
slowly
in
and
out
among
the
circling
throng
it
s
different
from
anything
anywhere
any
time
said
he
you
re
too
vague
she
sighed
i
never
know
whether
you
re
making
fun
of
me
or
not
don
t
i
dance
right
right
you
dance
like
like
now
i
know
you
re
trying
to
think
of
a
pretty
allusion
do
get
a
good
yes
i
will
you
dance
like
why
very
much
like
i
do
we
re
both
ripping
good
patty
laughed
out
at
this
it
a
compliment
she
said
though
not
just
the
sort
i
girls
expect
so
much
there
the
music
s
stopped
must
i
take
you
back
to
lady
kitty
or
will
you
give
me
the
next
dance
take
me
back
please
but
later
on
if
you
care
for
another
dance
you
may
come
back
if
you
i
like
i
think
you
were
made
for
men
to
come
back
to
ah
lady
hamilton
here
is
your
fair
charge
not
a
frill
missing
of
the
original
hundred
which
speaks
well
for
my
guardianship
as
many
of
the
ladies
are
ruefully
regarding
tattered
so
crowded
is
the
dancing
will
you
trust
yourself
to
me
then
said
another
voice
and
patty
turned
to
see
peter
homer
smiling
at
her
yes
homer
she
said
as
soon
as
i
get
my
programme
again
austin
has
it
oh
here
it
is
yes
you
may
have
this
and
rosy
with
the
fun
of
it
all
patty
put
her
hand
on
homer
s
arm
and
walked
away
but
he
led
her
away
from
the
dancers
to
an
adjoining
room
where
there
were
fewer
people
less
light
and
no
music
sit
down
here
and
talk
to
me
he
said
arranging
a
chair
for
her
i
don
t
care
for
dancing
at
well
upon
my
word
said
patty
but
i
do
care
for
yes
i
know
you
do
but
just
now
you
re
going
to
stay
right
here
with
me
so
you
may
as
well
accept
it
why
should
i
want
to
do
that
said
patty
who
always
rebelled
at
coercion
everybody
else
is
smiling
and
gay
while
you
look
like
cloudy
with
showers
oh
no
i
don
t
said
homer
smiling
and
now
what
shall
i
talk
to
you
about
italy
said
patty
promptly
i
m
going
there
soon
i
don
t
know
a
thing
about
it
and
i
want
to
know
it
all
what
s
it
like
well
italy
is
like
a
lovely
monday
in
the
spring
when
they
ve
washed
the
sky
and
blued
it
and
hung
it
up
in
the
sunshine
to
that
s
pretty
said
patty
approvingly
and
are
there
trees
yes
trees
tied
together
with
long
ropes
of
grapevines
they
look
like
alpine
travellers
roped
together
for
what
are
they
really
tied
for
they
re
not
tied
the
grapevines
are
festooned
from
one
tree
to
another
in
the
orchards
thus
it
is
a
vineyard
and
an
orchard
it
sounds
lovely
tell
me
no
i
would
rather
hear
you
talk
tell
me
what
you
want
most
to
find
in
there
s
plenty
of
that
italy
is
a
saturated
solution
of
beauty
which
kind
do
you
want
art
or
nature
i
know
so
little
about
art
a
lady
at
luncheon
was
surprised
because
i
don
t
even
know
the
names
of
the
twelve
what
are
they
the
scenes
of
creation
why
a
list
of
twelve
of
the
greatest
pictures
in
the
my
word
there
s
no
fool
like
an
art
fool
but
you
re
too
chameleonic
to
go
to
italy
anyway
it
has
some
several
hundred
sides
and
you
ll
absorb
a
bit
of
every
one
of
them
and
come
back
a
mosaic
yourself
i
wish
you
could
concentrate
but
i
suppose
you
re
too
i
m
not
so
dreadfully
young
and
i
am
not
bred
so
dull
but
i
can
well
learn
right
then
don
t
let
them
teach
you
to
rave
over
botticelli
s
spring
go
and
look
at
david
mightn
t
that
be
merely
a
difference
of
individual
taste
homer
frowned
yes
it
might
be
he
said
have
you
an
individual
taste
about
to
be
offended
patty
thought
better
of
it
and
smiled
what
a
dear
disposition
you
have
said
homer
in
a
tone
full
of
contrition
i
have
a
brutal
way
of
speaking
i
know
and
i
am
so
sorry
but
i
wish
i
could
show
you
italy
as
you
should
see
everybody
seems
to
want
to
show
me
italy
as
i
should
see
it
observed
patty
placidly
yes
and
you
ll
get
a
fine
jumble
of
it
italy
is
half
glory
and
half
glamour
and
you
ll
be
so
rolled
up
in
the
mists
of
glamour
that
you
can
t
see
the
glory
i
hope
i
shall
exclaimed
patty
i
want
the
glamour
i
want
to
see
the
coliseum
by
moonlight
i
don
t
care
how
hackneyed
it
is
you
oughtn
t
to
see
it
by
moonlight
you
ought
to
see
it
at
midday
in
the
strong
clear
sunlight
and
all
alone
listen
to
its
vibrant
silence
that
tells
you
of
oh
said
patty
thrilled
by
the
intense
note
in
his
voice
i
didn
t
know
you
had
so
much
that
isn
t
imagination
it
s
reality
the
real
past
speaks
to
you
not
a
foolish
emotional
reproduction
that
you
have
conjured
up
the
curfew
tolls
the
knell
of
our
next
dance
chanted
floyd
austin
coming
toward
them
i
thought
i
never
should
find
you
miss
fairfield
may
i
have
you
please
mr
homer
is
telling
me
about
the
coliseum
said
patty
making
no
move
to
go
quite
right
quite
right
if
any
one
has
anything
to
say
he
may
as
well
say
it
about
the
coliseum
but
that
is
liable
to
stand
for
some
time
yet
and
this
witching
hour
is
fleeting
so
cub
oh
cub
with
be
the
bood
is
patty
rose
laughing
i
suppose
i
must
go
she
said
as
homer
bowed
courteously
and
murmured
a
few
words
of
regret
at
her
departure
another
victim
said
austin
quizzically
now
how
can
a
will
o
the
wisp
like
you
attract
a
wise
and
solemn
old
owl
like
homer
he
attracted
me
said
patty
simply
oh
that
explains
it
but
then
you
also
attract
people
who
do
not
attract
you
myself
for
why
i
think
you
re
quite
pleasant
said
saucy
patty
looking
at
him
with
an
air
of
patronising
indifference
you
d
better
think
so
or
i
won
t
be
pleasant
oh
yes
you
will
you
re
always
as
rollo
s
uncle
said
to
him
it
s
a
pleasure
to
go
about
with
such
a
pleasant
and
sensible
boy
as
but
i
didn
t
say
thank
heaven
for
that
now
never
mind
remembering
what
homer
told
you
about
the
coliseum
but
remember
what
i
tell
you
be
sure
to
see
it
by
moonlight
first
the
night
i
first
saw
it
the
moon
was
gibbous
what
does
gibbous
mean
i
haven
t
the
slightest
idea
but
anyway
the
moon
was
awful
gibbous
and
the
moonlight
was
misty
like
spray
you
know
and
it
flooded
the
coliseum
and
ran
over
onto
the
dome
of
peter
s
what
nonsense
are
you
talking
you
can
t
see
peter
s
from
the
coliseum
can
you
have
you
ever
been
to
rome
now
that
you
mention
it
i
don
t
believe
i
have
but
what
s
the
use
of
imagination
if
you
can
t
see
things
you
ve
never
seen
you
are
too
ridiculous
declared
patty
laughing
and
then
nodding
him
a
dismissal
as
cadwalader
oram
claimed
her
for
a
dance
how
she
is
made
for
happiness
said
austin
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
lady
kitty
and
together
they
watched
patty
dance
away
she
is
agreed
kitty
who
was
a
friend
of
floyd
austin
and
greatly
liked
the
young
man
yet
she
s
not
nearly
so
much
of
a
butterfly
as
she
i
m
sure
of
that
though
i
ve
only
seen
her
butterflyish
side
if
meredith
hadn
t
already
used
the
phrase
a
dainty
rogue
in
porcelain
i
should
coin
it
to
describe
miss
fairfield
don
t
tell
me
she
has
an
aim
in
not
quite
that
but
i
think
sometimes
she
wishes
she
had
you
mean
she
thinks
she
ought
to
wish
she
had
yes
that
is
a
truer
statement
of
the
case
agreed
kitty
chapter
iv
a
farewell
party
and
fairfield
arrived
duly
at
markleham
grange
and
in
response
to
urgent
invitation
consented
to
stay
there
for
a
few
days
before
taking
patty
away
with
them
but
the
last
evening
had
come
and
the
party
that
gathered
on
the
terrace
after
dinner
showed
that
subdued
air
that
last
evenings
usually
compel
the
party
was
not
a
small
one
for
there
had
been
guests
at
dinner
and
several
of
the
young
people
from
the
neighbouring
had
come
over
later
to
say
to
patty
i
m
so
sorry
to
have
you
go
said
flo
carrington
as
she
possessed
herself
of
patty
s
hand
and
caressed
it
i
m
sorry
to
go
replied
patty
somehow
it
seems
as
if
i
were
always
saying
to
somebody
i
ve
visited
so
much
this
summer
and
every
visit
means
a
regretful
at
the
heartrending
pathos
of
miss
fairfield
s
tones
everybody
burst
into
tears
declaimed
floyd
austin
burying
his
face
in
a
voluminous
handkerchief
but
so
burlesque
was
his
woe
that
everybody
burst
into
laughter
instead
you
may
stay
here
if
you
choose
instead
of
going
with
us
patty
said
her
father
i
didn
t
realise
it
would
be
such
a
wrench
for
you
and
your
no
thank
you
said
patty
decidedly
the
longer
i
stay
the
more
painful
would
be
the
wrench
and
i
ve
no
notion
of
losing
my
italian
trip
that
s
the
right
way
to
look
at
it
said
austin
approvingly
and
cheer
up
the
fatal
blow
is
yet
to
fall
i
too
am
going
to
italy
in
a
few
weeks
and
i
ll
meet
you
on
any
rialto
you
are
you
really
exclaimed
patty
pleased
at
the
prospect
won
t
that
be
gay
father
and
lady
hamilton
and
her
father
are
going
later
too
we
can
have
a
reunion
won
t
you
come
flo
i
wish
i
could
said
the
girl
and
fairfield
said
heartily
i
shall
be
more
than
glad
to
welcome
any
of
patty
s
friends
wherever
we
meet
them
when
are
you
starting
austin
i
m
not
sure
yet
fairfield
perhaps
in
two
or
three
weeks
keep
me
posted
as
to
your
whereabouts
and
i
ll
find
you
do
we
are
going
direct
to
rome
and
shall
stay
there
for
a
time
before
we
begin
a
series
of
other
are
you
going
to
milan
asked
cadwalader
oram
yes
later
said
fairfield
and
patty
said
why
because
i
want
you
to
be
sure
to
see
the
man
with
his
skin
hanging
over
his
what
yes
truly
it
s
a
great
statue
in
the
cathedral
you
know
the
gentleman
was
flayed
he
was
one
of
the
noble
family
of
martyrs
and
it
was
his
whim
to
have
his
statue
taken
with
his
whole
skin
flung
gracefully
over
one
arm
it
s
a
most
impressive
i
should
think
so
said
patty
i
ll
jot
that
down
in
my
book
i
m
making
a
list
of
things
to
see
that
are
not
in
the
well
you
won
t
find
that
in
a
guidebook
but
be
sure
not
to
miss
we
won
t
said
fairfield
it
sounds
extremely
i
m
going
to
coax
mother
to
let
me
go
said
flo
carrington
she
s
always
promised
me
an
italian
trip
and
snippy
could
take
me
as
well
as
who
s
snippy
asked
patty
my
governess
she
s
been
with
us
for
years
and
she
s
awfully
capable
and
and
languaged
and
all
that
if
she
will
take
me
and
mother

me
go
may
i
see
you
sometimes

may
indeed
said
fairfield
answering
for
his
daughter
come
right
along
miss
carrington
and
we
ll
be
of
service
to
you
in
any
way
we
oh
thank
you
said
flo
her
dark
eyes
dancing
at
the
thought
of
such
a
pleasure
trip
i
ll
try
to
wheedle
mumsie
into
it
and
i
ll
let
you
know
patty
if
i
succeed
i
ll
write
you
in
i
wish
my
mumsie
would
let
me
go
put
in
caddy
oram
in
such
plaintive
tones
that
they
all
laughed
but
she
can
t
spare
her
pet
boy
at
present
so
i
can
only
wish
you
all
sorts
of
happy
experiences
miss
the
young
man
rose
to
go
and
soon
there
was
a
general
departure
of
most
of
the
guests
floyd
austin
and
peter
homer
tarried
after
the
others
had
gone
and
lady
hamilton
proposed
that
they
all
go
indoors
for
the
evening
air
was
growing
chill
then
to
the
for
a
bit
of
a
farewell
supper
and
patty
as
guest
of
honour
was
queen
of
the
merry
feast
i
am
very
sorry
to
lose
my
little
miss
yankee
doodle
said
sir
otho
of
all
the
american
girls
i
ve
ever
met
and
i
ve
never
met
any
other
she
s
the
most
like
an
english
i
m
sorry
not
to
return
the
compliment
said
patty
but
you
re
not
the
least
bit
like
an
american
though
you
re
quite
the
nicest
englishman
i
a
groan
from
homer
and
a
wail
from
floyd
austin
greeted
this
speech
never
mind
said
austin
cheerfully
our
own
english
lassies
like
us
and
mayn
t
we
count
on
your
admiration
fairfield
said
peter
homer
i
trust
all
american
ladies
are
not
so
exclusive
in
their
favours
as
miss
you
may
indeed
said
nan
smiling
and
let
me
advise
you
not
to
take
patty
s
words
too
literally
i
m
beginning
to
think
that
since
she
escaped
my
restraining
influences
she
has
developed
coquettish
tendencies
i
d
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
she
admires
both
you
young
men
good
for
you
nan
cried
patty
i
do
i
think
they
re
great
and
i
m
not
a
coquette
at
all
i
d
like
to
be
but
i
don
t
know
don
t
bother
to
learn
said
peter
homer
it
will
come
naturally
after
a
deed
i
won
t
bother
to
learn
returned
patty
i
ve
too
much
to
learn
now
i
want
to
learn
italian
perfectly
before
i
start
for
italy
next
week
and
i
want
to
learn
all
about
art
and
architecture
and
everything
like
that
before
i
go
take
the
same
advice
for
those
things
said
austin
don
t
bother
to
learn
them
and
they
ll
come
naturally
after
a
i
agree
to
that
said
lady
hamilton
patty
will
learn
more
of
art
and
architecture
by
being
thus
suddenly
pushed
into
it
than
she
could
learn
from
a
hundred
or
right
agreed
sir
otho
heartily
but
don
t
try
too
hard
to
learn
little
girl
just
enjoy
these
are
your
years
for
enjoying
when
you
re
my
age
you
ll
have
time
to
that
s
a
new
theory
said
fairfield
smiling
but
i
rather
think
it
s
a
sound
i
think
so
too
said
nan
i
know
lots
of
people
who
have
just
spoiled
a
perfectly
good
trip
through
italy
because
they
learned
so
hard
they
had
no
time
to
one
should
go
through
italy
said
homer
with
a
mind
like
a
sieve
let
it
alone
and
worthless
trifles
will
sift
through
and
the
big
important
things
will
all
this
is
very
comforting
said
patty
with
a
relieved
sigh
i
had
expected
to
cram
as
if
for
an
examination
all
next
week
now
i
shan
t
even
open
a
having
supplied
miss
fairfield
with
all
necessary
advice
and
information
the
two
scholarly
and
erudite
gentlemen
rose
to
take
their
leave
drawled
austin
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
beckoned
to
homer
to
do
the
same
peter
homer
made
his
adieus
and
then
saying
to
patty
he
added
i
wish
i
were
to
show
you
my
italy
but
perhaps
it
s
just
as
well
for
you
to
discover
your
own
still
i
must
warn
you
not
to
let
the
glamour
gather
too
thickly
brush
it
off
once
in
a
while
and
look
at
the
real
i
ll
remember
promised
patty
but
we
ll
see
you
again
sooner
or
later
oh
yes
i
ll
be
in
italy
before
christmas
and
everybody
in
italy
runs
against
everybody
else
somewhere
said
patty
with
a
kindly
politeness
and
turned
to
say
the
same
to
austin
floyd
be
sure
to
go
to
the
aquarium
in
naples
he
reminded
her
for
the
fourteenth
time
the
polyps
are
so
pleasantly
disgusting
and
that
fat
red
starfish
is
a
love
don
t
disgrace
your
country
remember
you
re
i
shall
miss
you
oh
my
heart
will
be
as
an
empty
colander
my
dolour
will
be
as
of
one
without
hope
i
shall
be
as
a
mullein
stalk
but
tis
better
so
austin
s
melodramatic
tone
was
so
absurd
that
the
final
were
said
amid
much
laughter
but
patty
was
conscious
of
a
sincere
regret
at
leaving
the
gay
merriment
of
markleham
grange
and
its
pleasant
neighbours
next
morning
the
three
fairfields
started
for
london
sir
otho
and
lady
kitty
partly
promised
to
join
them
later
in
italy
but
the
matter
was
not
fully
decided
flo
carrington
too
had
sent
over
an
early
note
excitedly
saying
that
she
was
not
yet
sure
she
could
go
but
the
outlook
was
extremely
hopeful
late
in
the
afternoon
they
reached
london
and
as
they
left
the
train
and
found
themselves
in
the
ponderous
bustle
of
the
railway
station
going
through
the
usual
distracting
hunt
for
their
luggage
patty
s
love
for
the
great
city
came
back
to
her
and
she
remarked
to
nan
that
she
greatly
preferred
city
to
country
at
any
time
you
a
chameleon
patty
said
nan
laughing
i
always
said
you
were
wherever
you
are
you
immediately
claim
that
it
s
the
best
place
in
the
and
a
happy
disposition
that
is
broke
in
fairfield
though
i
m
ready
to
admit
that
this
sitting
on
one
s
trunk
to
prevent
another
citizen
from
attaching
it
is
not
my
idea
of
luxurious
however
as
always
finally
happens
a
porter
performed
a
great
magic
and
the
party
in
cab
drove
off
to
the
savoy
once
again
in
one
of
its
pleasantest
apartments
the
dust
of
travel
removed
and
tea
served
it
seemed
like
getting
back
home
once
more
fairfield
having
pronounced
against
a
restaurant
dinner
had
a
delightful
meal
sent
up
to
their
own
cosy
and
the
three
greatly
enjoyed
their
family
reunion
you
people
are
the
best
declared
patty
as
she
lingered
appreciatively
over
her
somewhat
scanty
portion
of
ice
cream
by
the
way
she
interrupted
herself
i
know
why
in
london
they
always
say
ice
instead
of
ice
it
s
because
they
never
serve
enough
of
it
to
justify
the
longer
title
though
it
s
of
the
same
materials
and
quite
as
good
as
the
american
variety
well
as
i
was
saying
you
two
are
the
best
people
i
know
i
ve
had
quite
enough
of
friends
and
acquaintances
and
hostesses
and
staying
guests
and
all
that
i
m
glad
to
be
back
with
my
i
d
think
more
of
that
patty
said
nan
smiling
if
i
weren
t
sure
that
you
d
take
the
first
chance
that
offered
to
go
straying
off
isn
t
she
awful
daddy
said
patty
placidly
she
doesn
t
know
a
compliment
when
she
sees
one
well
let
s
have
these
empty
plates
removed
and
get
out
our
maps
and
plans
i
m
crazy
to
see
where
we
re
we
shan
t
have
a
itinerary
said
fairfield
as
he
produced
a
bundle
of
maps
and
and
memoranda
we
ll
leave
next
wednesday
for
paris
stay
there
a
day
or
two
if
you
girls
want
to
shop
a
little
then
when
we
re
ready
we
ll
take
the
rome
express
right
through
after
we
re
well
settled
in
rome
and
have
seen
more
or
less
of
its
sights
we
ll
plan
what
to
do
next
in
a
general
way
i
may
say
that
we
ll
go
from
rome
up
to
the
other
principal
cities
and
back
to
rome
again
we
may
decide
to
spend
the
whole
winter
there
but
for
my
part
i
d
be
best
pleased
that
is
if
it
suits
you
two
to
eat
my
christmas
dinner
in
new
york
city
me
too
cried
patty
her
thoughts
suddenly
rolling
in
a
homesick
wave
toward
her
native
land
me
too
cried
nan
enthusiastically
but
fairfield
only
smiled
and
said
we
won
t
decide
that
now
we
ll
have
a
fine
italian
trip
and
it
shall
be
shorter
or
longer
as
suits
our
dear
old
daddy
said
patty
you
have
the
most
gumption
of
anybody
i
know
i
m
so
glad
i
picked
out
a
wise
father
as
well
as
such
a
handsome
i
wish
you
had
inherited
either
trait
said
fairfield
with
a
mock
sigh
and
patty
answered
him
only
by
a
saucy
glance
the
few
days
that
intervened
between
their
arrival
in
london
and
their
departure
for
paris
were
busy
ones
for
nan
and
patty
there
was
some
shopping
to
be
done
but
this
was
hurried
through
that
they
might
have
more
time
to
pay
farewell
visits
to
some
of
their
favourite
haunts
but
you
must
get
some
dresses
patty
said
nan
as
patty
declared
her
intention
of
spending
a
day
in
the
picture
galleries
you
can
t
wear
muslin
and
chiffon
evening
gowns
on
italian
italians
don
t
have
railroads
my
ignorant
little
stepmother
they
have
railways
or
more
likely
they
call
them
by
some
absurd
unpronounceable
name
of
their
own
well
as
i
was
saying
i
ll
get
dresses
in
paris
but
if
we
re
really
going
home
from
italy
straight
to
new
york
and
not
coming
back
here
again
there
are
some
loved
spots
that
my
infancy
knew
in
london
to
which
i
simply
repair
once
more
all
right
girlie
you
ve
only
four
days
left
in
london
so
spend
them
as
you
so
patty
wandered
about
as
she
chose
spending
an
afternoon
in
westminster
abbey
and
a
morning
in
the
british
museum
and
often
enjoying
a
drive
in
the
parks
there
were
few
people
whom
they
knew
in
london
as
most
of
them
were
still
in
their
but
the
weather
was
cool
and
pleasant
and
patty
declared
she
was
glad
not
to
be
bothered
with
social
engagements
at
last
the
day
came
when
they
must
leave
for
paris
trunks
were
strapped
and
despatched
boxes
containing
various
purchases
they
had
made
were
shipped
directly
home
to
new
york
and
with
real
tears
in
her
eyes
patty
stood
looking
out
of
the
hotel
window
down
on
the
noisy
bustling
strand
cheer
up
said
nan
observing
her
we
ll
come
back
here
some
day
if
not
this
i
never
thought
of
that
exclaimed
patty
as
the
smiles
broke
over
her
face
why
of
course
we
shall
what
a
comfort
you
are
nan
why
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
we
came
over
every
summer
mayn
t
we
every
other
summer
perhaps
said
nan
a
little
absently
for
she
was
attending
to
some
last
matters
come
patty
said
her
father
the
cab
s
here
wave
a
weeping
farewell
to
your
london
joys
and
turn
a
smiling
face
to
fresh
fields
and
pastures
all
ready
father
said
patty
cheerily
and
in
a
few
moments
they
were
off
at
victoria
station
they
took
the
train
for
dover
and
patty
looked
from
the
window
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
get
glimpses
of
the
great
city
they
were
leaving
to
many
people
the
crossing
of
the
english
channel
is
not
a
pleasing
experience
nan
frankly
confessed
that
she
did
not
care
for
it
at
all
but
patty
and
her
father
being
blessed
with
entire
freedom
from
any
physical
discomfort
in
the
matter
went
aboard
the
channel
steamer
with
anticipations
of
a
pleasant
trip
across
the
ideal
time
to
sail
away
from
the
dover
cliffs
is
when
the
sunlight
dazzles
on
the
white
chalk
formations
and
the
green
grass
and
blue
water
and
the
pink
tints
on
the
rocks
all
form
a
beautiful
panorama
of
the
brightest
colouring
possible
patty
and
her
father
having
done
all
they
could
to
make
nan
as
comfortable
as
possible
they
left
her
at
her
own
request
in
charge
of
a
stewardess
and
returned
to
the
upper
deck
here
in
two
steamer
chairs
they
sat
and
watched
england
disappear
as
they
went
on
the
intrusive
spray
dashed
up
on
the
deck
and
finally
onto
the
travellers
themselves
patty
laughed
in
glee
for
her
travelling
cloak
was
of
staunch
material
and
she
thought
the
dashing
drops
great
fun
but
as
the
spray
flew
higher
the
deckmaster
brought
tarpaulins
to
wrap
about
them
and
thus
protected
the
two
seafarers
enjoyed
the
rough
crossing
isn
t
it
gay
cried
patty
as
a
cloud
of
drops
splashed
full
in
her
face
making
her
curly
hair
curl
tighter
about
her
brow
fine
answered
fairfield
but
he
had
to
scream
to
make
himself
heard
above
the
racket
of
the
sea
as
they
neared
shore
they
went
below
to
tidy
up
for
the
landing
and
found
nan
radiantly
smiling
as
she
awaited
them
i
m
all
right
now
she
announced
but
i
shouldn
t
have
been
if
i
d
been
pitching
and
tossing
about
in
the
upper
air
as
you
have
goodness
but
you
re
a
sight
both
of
you
can
you
get
wrung
out
in
time
to
land
do
you
think
but
in
a
short
time
fairfield
and
patty
were
transformed
into
dry
and
citizens
and
no
sign
remained
of
their
watery
escapade
save
the
damp
curls
that
clustered
around
patty
s
forehead
chapter
days
in
paris
the
fairfields
spent
a
few
delightful
days
in
paris
they
staid
at
a
large
and
pleasant
hotel
and
their
rooms
looked
out
upon
the
place
vendôme
which
was
one
of
patty
s
favourite
spots
in
the
french
capital
i
own
that
column
she
remarked
to
her
father
as
they
looked
out
the
window
at
the
great
shaft
with
its
spiral
decorations
indeed
said
fairfield
given
to
you
by
the
french
people
as
a
token
of
regard
and
esteem
not
exactly
that
said
patty
i
own
it
by
right
of
adoption
or
rather
appropriation
all
the
things
i
specially
like
and
that
are
too
big
to
carry
home
i
own
that
a
fine
plan
commented
her
father
and
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
a
cheap
one
too
but
you
must
remember
this
vendôme
column
especially
for
you
ll
see
its
twin
in
another
just
like
it
not
just
like
it
but
similar
the
one
in
rome
is
trajan
s
column
and
is
of
marble
but
this
one
of
masonry
covered
with
plates
of
bronze
was
constructed
in
imitation
of
the
roman
one
this
however
is
nearly
twice
as
oh
pooh
then
i
shan
t
care
for
such
a
little
thing
at
wait
till
you
see
it
said
her
father
laughing
i
think
you
ll
find
it
and
is
trajan
on
top
of
it
as
napoleon
is
on
this
trajan
was
at
first
but
he
has
been
replaced
by
a
statue
of
i
m
glad
i
m
going
to
see
it
said
patty
contentedly
i
love
that
s
right
child
learn
to
know
columns
and
arches
and
steps
and
you
re
fairly
started
on
the
road
to
steps
cried
patty
in
surprise
are
steps
ever
beautiful
yes
indeed
don
t
you
remember
i
called
your
attention
to
them
many
times
in
london
those
of
the
church
of
martin
for
oh
yes
i
remember
those
i
must
look
up
this
matter
of
i
ll
show
you
plenty
in
italy
i
m
not
going
to
overburden
you
patty
with
instructive
lore
but
you
must
acquire
a
general
knowledge
of
what
you
re
yes
i
want
to
i
don
t
want
to
talk
like
the
people
who
say
i
don
t
know
a
thing
about
art
but
i
know
what
i
if
you
ever
express
that
sentiment
i
ll
disown
you
some
people
invariably
like
the
wrong
oh
i
know
how
to
find
out
what
s
worth
while
you
just
pick
out
a
most
stupid
and
uninteresting
little
picture
or
statue
and
then
you
look
in
your
baedeker
and
he
tells
you
it
s
the
gem
of
the
you
re
hopeless
declared
her
father
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
and
you
can
do
your
sightseeing
in
your
own
but
he
well
knew
she
was
only
jesting
and
many
a
pleasant
hour
they
spent
among
the
art
treasures
in
paris
while
patty
unconsciously
absorbed
a
foundation
of
true
principles
of
worth
and
beauty
the
statue
of
the
venus
of
milo
was
her
greatest
delight
she
never
tired
of
standing
in
front
of
it
to
gaze
up
into
the
beautiful
face
isn
t
it
strange
she
said
to
her
father
one
day
that
the
expression
of
that
face
should
be
so
exquisite
so
so
well
so
perfectly
lovely
that
i
can
t
stop
looking
at
it
and
yet
all
the
photographs
of
it
are
so
different
the
photographs
all
make
her
have
a
supercilious
air
while
the
real
statue
is
anything
but
i
agree
with
you
said
nan
i
ve
often
noticed
it
and
the
plaster
casts
or
the
bronzes
are
not
a
bit
like
the
of
course
said
fairfield
the
plaster
or
bronze
of
reduced
size
can
t
be
expected
to
be
exact
portraits
but
surely
a
photograph
should
give
the
expression
of
the
original
face
for
doubtless
the
lady
stands
still
when
she
has
her
picture
but
the
pictures
like
her
insisted
patty
i
ve
bought
seventeen
different
photographs
of
her
including
and
they
re
not
the
leastest
mite
like
that
dear
seventeen
exclaimed
fairfield
are
you
going
to
set
up
a
shop
in
new
york
no
indeed
but
i
ve
been
trying
to
get
a
satisfactory
picture
and
i
can
on
their
way
home
patty
asked
to
stop
at
a
picture
shop
so
she
might
prove
her
assertions
i
m
afraid
to
go
in
said
fairfield
as
she
paused
at
a
small
shop
on
the
rue
de
rivoli
you
ll
buy
seventeen
more
and
expect
me
to
pay
for
them
no
i
won
t
come
on
in
i
know
the
dealer
and
he
ll
show
us
his
the
proprietor
of
the
shop
was
a
funny
little
old
frenchman
who
spoke
little
english
he
recognized
patty
and
shaking
his
head
said
no
ones
that
are
he
means
he
hasn
t
any
new
photographs
of
the
venus
since
i
was
here
yesterday
explained
patty
laughing
but
now
father
look
at
these
and
i
ll
show
you
what
i
together
they
looked
at
a
number
of
photographs
of
the
celebrated
statue
and
suddenly
nan
exclaimed
you
re
right
patty
and
i
know
why
it
s
because
all
these
photographs
are
taken
from
too
high
a
level
we
look
at
the
face
of
the
venus
from
below
it
was
made
to
be
looked
at
that
way
but
all
these
photographs
have
been
taken
by
cameras
raised
to
the
level
of
the
statue
s
head
or
above
it
and
that
foreshortens
her
face
the
wrong
way
why
look
in
this
one
you
see
all
the
top
of
her
head
looking
at
the
real
statue
you
see
only
the
hair
above
her
brow
i
can
t
explain
it
exactly
but
that
s
what
makes
her
expression
so
it
nan
cried
patty
it
makes
her
upper
lip
curl
and
her
nose
shrink
up
patty
patty
said
her
father
don
t
use
such
expressions
but
i
believe
you
re
right
nan
a
photograph
taken
from
the
same
height
as
our
eyes
would
give
a
far
different
view
of
the
yes
indeed
said
patty
oh
i
wish
they
d
let
me
take
they
won
t
said
fairfield
so
you
ll
just
have
to
engrave
her
on
your
though
they
were
convinced
that
their
theory
was
right
they
couldn
t
persuade
the
old
frenchman
to
agree
with
them
he
admitted
that
the
pictures
were
unlike
the
expression
of
the
original
face
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
many
photographs
many
postcards
but
only
one
and
the
rapt
look
in
his
eyes
showed
that
he
like
patty
preferred
his
memory
of
the
marble
to
any
possible
reproduction
of
it
the
last
day
they
spent
in
paris
nan
declared
she
was
going
to
buy
things
we
ll
do
plenty
of
sightseeing
in
italy
she
said
but
there
s
nothing
there
to
buy
except
heads
of
dante
and
models
of
the
roman
and
beads
said
patty
i
m
going
to
get
pecks
of
beads
everybody
expects
you
to
bring
them
home
a
string
or
all
right
said
nan
but
i
mean
gorgeous
raiment
paris
is
the
only
place
for
that
so
i
buy
me
some
hats
and
frippery
teagowns
and
other
gewgaws
want
to
go
patsy
deed
i
do
i
adore
to
buy
feathers
and
you
re
two
vain
butterflies
said
fairfield
but
if
you
ll
excuse
me
from
going
with
you
on
this
excursion
i
ll
agree
to
pay
the
bills
you
send
this
was
a
highly
satisfactory
arrangement
and
the
two
ladies
started
out
for
a
round
of
the
shops
patty
had
such
good
taste
and
nan
such
good
judgment
that
they
bought
only
the
most
desirable
things
and
a
fine
collection
they
made
it
s
really
economy
to
buy
these
patty
said
nan
holding
up
some
embroidered
waists
as
sheer
and
fine
as
a
handkerchief
for
they
re
about
half
the
price
they
cost
at
home
and
as
these
styles
are
ahead
of
ours
they
ll
be
all
right
for
next
right
you
are
said
patty
gaily
and
what
we
don
t
want
ourselves
will
be
lovely
for
christmas
presents
and
oh
nan
do
look
at
these
lace
parasols
i
m
going
to
get
one
for
marian
she
ll
be
wild
over
no
don
t
patty
they
are
exquisite
and
would
be
just
the
thing
for
an
english
garden
party
but
marian
would
never
have
an
opportunity
to
carry
that
fluff
of
lace
and
chiffon
and
pink
i
s
pose
not
said
patty
regretfully
it
would
look
startling
to
take
to
the
tea
cub
meetings
at
vernondale
and
she
couldn
t
carry
it
to
new
york
well
i
ll
leave
it
then
and
get
her
a
mackintosh
or
something
sensible
no
don
t
go
to
the
other
extreme
said
nan
laughing
get
her
a
hat
if
you
like
or
a
feather
boa
but
get
something
that
the
girl
can
sensible
little
stepmother
said
patty
you
re
always
right
and
i
m
proud
to
be
your
friend
and
so
the
buying
went
merrily
on
sometimes
patty
advised
nan
against
a
combination
of
colours
that
didn
t
quite
harmonise
or
a
decoration
that
wasn
t
exactly
suitable
and
nan
gladly
deferred
to
the
younger
girl
s
taste
one
more
farewell
glimpse
of
my
venus
and
then
i
ll
go
home
said
patty
as
the
afternoon
shadows
began
to
lengthen
and
telling
the
cabman
to
take
them
to
the
louvre
the
two
went
in
for
a
last
sight
of
the
statue
she
beautiful
said
patty
for
the
fiftieth
time
i
there
ll
be
nothing
in
all
italy
to
compare
with
you
can
t
know
that
till
you
ve
been
there
said
practical
nan
and
then
she
had
to
drag
patty
away
and
they
went
back
to
the
hotel
their
purchases
were
there
awaiting
them
so
quick
are
the
ways
of
the
paris
shops
and
they
found
fairfield
in
the
middle
of
their
sitting
room
completely
surrounded
by
parcels
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
snowed
under
he
declared
as
they
came
in
then
he
helped
to
untie
the
bundles
and
pack
most
of
them
in
trunks
to
be
sent
directly
to
america
we
want
to
take
whatever
luggage
we
need
with
us
he
said
but
don
t
take
anything
we
don
t
need
excess
luggage
is
expensive
in
italy
but
it
s
worth
the
extra
expense
if
we
want
it
for
our
convenience
or
so
each
had
a
individual
trunk
and
another
trunk
held
some
evening
gowns
for
nan
and
patty
not
to
be
opened
except
when
social
occasions
required
still
another
trunk
held
indispensable
odds
and
ends
that
belonged
to
all
of
them
and
fairfield
said
that
was
enough
to
look
after
you
re
lovely
people
to
travel
with
said
patty
thoughtfully
when
i
came
over
here
with
the
farringtons
they
had
leven
trunks
and
they
never
could
find
what
they
wanted
without
going
through
the
whole
much
better
to
get
along
with
a
few
said
her
father
and
then
you
can
find
things
more
fairfield
was
a
systematic
and
methodical
man
and
had
always
instilled
these
traits
into
both
patty
and
nan
so
they
were
always
ready
at
traintime
or
a
little
before
and
thus
were
saved
the
many
annoyances
that
follow
in
the
train
of
delay
and
procrastination
the
next
afternoon
they
started
for
rome
fairfield
chose
to
go
by
the
rome
express
a
rapid
and
train
patty
was
greatly
interested
in
the
strange
appointments
of
the
cars
the
fairfields
had
two
compartments
the
larger
double
one
for
the
use
of
patty
and
nan
the
other
for
fairfield
but
at
first
they
all
sat
together
in
the
double
compartment
which
was
arranged
like
a
and
not
at
all
like
american
they
would
be
on
the
train
two
nights
and
one
day
and
fairfield
chose
this
plan
because
it
enabled
them
to
see
the
alps
by
daylight
it
s
just
like
being
in
our
own
house
isn
t
it
said
patty
as
they
settled
their
belongings
into
place
and
indeed
it
was
shut
away
from
the
other
passengers
in
their
cosy
little
room
they
were
as
secluded
as
if
at
home
the
comfortable
seats
and
convenient
little
tables
racks
and
shelves
made
room
for
all
their
impedimenta
and
patty
declared
it
was
lots
nicer
than
american
parlour
cars
where
everybody
was
in
the
same
room
though
of
course
you
can
take
a
said
nan
yes
if
you
re
a
millionaire
said
patty
but
this
is
fixed
so
everybody
can
be
by
would
you
rather
have
your
dinner
served
in
here
asked
her
father
no
i
d
rather
go
to
the
i
want
to
see
more
of
my
there
may
be
brigands
on
board
i
always
think
of
italy
as
peopled
with
what
are
they
like
asked
nan
idly
oh
they
have
big
cowboy
hats
and
red
silk
sashes
and
awful
black
beards
and
they
carry
those
are
pirates
suggested
her
father
oh
yes
so
they
are
well
my
brigands
carry
oh
no
said
nan
laughing
not
revolvers
you
might
as
well
give
them
tomahawks
brigands
in
italy
carry
stilettos
of
stilettos
cried
patty
in
amazement
they
re
what
you
use
in
embroidery
well
you
an
ignorant
young
person
declared
fairfield
an
italian
stiletto
is
a
small
dagger
or
poniard
that
s
it
exclaimed
patty
no
brigand
would
carry
anything
but
a
poniard
do
you
suppose
there
are
many
on
the
train
father
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
but
we
ll
go
to
dinner
now
and
if
there
are
any
we
ll
scrape
acquaintance
with
so
to
the
they
went
and
patty
cast
discreet
but
curious
glances
in
at
the
doors
of
the
other
compartments
as
she
passed
them
she
saw
no
brigands
and
among
the
passengers
were
not
many
italians
they
all
seemed
to
be
people
of
their
own
stamp
probably
travelling
on
the
same
kind
of
a
trip
the
was
comfortable
and
the
tables
on
one
side
held
four
people
and
on
the
other
side
each
was
arranged
for
two
the
fairfields
sat
at
a
quartette
table
and
as
no
one
occupied
the
fourth
seat
they
were
pleasantly
by
themselves
again
it
was
patty
s
first
introduction
to
italian
cookery
and
she
was
much
interested
in
the
strange
dishes
the
spaghetti
though
very
good
was
served
in
such
large
quantities
that
she
was
amazed
does
anyone
ever
eat
a
whole
portion
she
said
but
she
noticed
that
many
of
the
diners
did
do
so
and
indeed
she
made
large
inroads
on
her
own
share
it
s
fine
she
said
i
did
not
know
it
could
be
so
on
its
native
heath
spaghetti
is
quite
different
from
an
american
arrangement
of
it
said
her
father
i
m
glad
you
like
it
for
you
ll
have
very
few
meals
without
it
all
the
time
you
re
in
the
other
viands
were
good
too
and
the
variety
of
cheeses
and
fruits
was
positively
bewildering
how
different
from
an
english
or
french
meal
said
patty
as
they
finished
isn
t
it
interesting
the
different
things
that
different
countries
eat
do
you
suppose
that
s
what
makes
them
the
sort
of
people
they
are
your
question
is
a
little
ambiguous
laughed
her
father
but
it
doesn
t
always
seem
logical
for
instance
you
d
scarcely
think
this
innocent
spaghetti
would
produce
a
race
of
ferocious
brigands
such
as
you
re
expecting
to
meet
by
the
way
do
you
see
any
not
one
said
patty
as
she
glanced
round
the
car
i
m
fearfully
don
t
give
up
hope
yet
perhaps
they
re
lying
in
ambush
somewhere
and
they
ll
hold
up
the
train
in
the
after
the
long
dinner
there
was
not
much
evening
left
so
our
travellers
soon
concluded
they
were
ready
for
their
rest
don
t
be
afraid
said
fairfield
as
he
left
the
two
ladies
to
go
to
his
own
sleeping
berth
i
don
t
believe
there
s
a
brigand
on
the
i
don
t
either
said
patty
so
i
shan
t
lie
awake
in
shivering
soon
she
and
nan
were
sleeping
quietly
in
the
funny
narrow
beds
that
were
so
like
shelves
and
the
next
thing
patty
knew
was
a
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
compartment
she
was
awake
in
an
instant
and
shook
the
sleeping
nan
wake
up
she
whispered
there
s
a
brigand
knocking
at
the
nonsense
said
nan
rubbing
her
eyes
what
do
you
mean
the
knock
was
repeated
and
nan
jumped
up
what
shall
we
do
she
said
perhaps
we
d
better
not
answer
at
but
the
knocks
became
more
peremptory
and
throwing
on
a
kimono
nan
went
to
the
door
and
without
opening
it
said
who
s
there
open
the
door
said
a
commanding
voice
it
a
brigand
said
patty
hopping
about
on
one
foot
where
are
your
jewels
nan
your
father
has
them
don
t
be
silly
patty
of
course
it
isn
t
a
brigand
but
who
can
it
be
perhaps
fred
is
as
the
knocking
continued
and
as
the
voice
kept
on
demanding
that
the
door
be
opened
nan
opened
it
cautiously
and
saw
before
her
a
big
burly
man
in
an
official
uniform
sorry
to
disturb
you
ma
am
he
said
but
have
you
any
luggage
in
your
room
no
said
nan
only
hand
how
many
trunks
in
the
he
went
on
and
nan
told
him
anything
dutiable
in
them
why
i
don
t
know
what
is
dutiable
spirits
or
tobacco
ma
why
no
of
course
we
haven
t
any
of
those
things
in
our
any
matches
thank
you
good
night
madam
sorry
to
trouble
the
big
man
went
away
and
patty
tumbled
back
to
bed
murmuring
huh
to
be
waked
up
and
bothered
and
then
not
see
a
brigand
after
all
i
do
think
the
customs
men
might
at
least
wear
red
silk
sashes
they
d
be
so
much
more
picturesque
what
a
queer
time
for
him
to
come
to
see
about
the
i
believe
they
always
come
when
we
cross
the
border
said
nan
sleepily
said
patty
chapter
vi
the
grandeur
that
was
rome
it
was
very
early
in
the
morning
when
the
train
pulled
into
the
station
at
rome
patty
had
been
up
and
dressed
for
some
time
watching
from
the
window
the
strange
views
and
novel
sights
here
we
are
said
fairfield
and
patty
hurried
from
the
train
in
her
eager
interest
to
see
the
real
rome
outside
of
a
map
or
guidebook
well
she
said
as
she
found
herself
in
a
great
station
not
so
very
unlike
railroad
stations
in
other
countries
well
if
you
call
this
picturesque
i
don
t
nothing
can
be
picturesque
when
you
re
hungry
said
nan
and
i
m
going
to
get
my
breakfast
before
i
express
my
opinion
of
the
eternal
good
girl
nan
said
fairfield
approvingly
and
i
fancy
patty
too
is
ready
for
some
roman
breakfast
i
am
hungry
said
patty
but
i
m
so
surprised
at
this
place
why
she
went
on
as
they
emerged
into
the
great
square
in
front
of
the
station
look
at
the
it
s
just
like
new
york
you
needn
t
get
in
a
said
fairfield
laughing
at
patty
s
dismayed
expression
here
s
the
omnibus
that
s
to
take
us
to
our
hotel
hop
pooh
an
omnibus
said
patty
that
isn
t
appropriate
to
rome
either
i
know
what
you
want
to
ride
in
said
her
father
one
of
those
roman
chariots
drawn
by
four
horses
that
they
race
round
the
ring
in
at
the
those
things
said
patty
laughing
at
the
recollection
yes
they
would
be
all
right
only
there
s
so
much
danger
of
spilling
out
but
she
climbed
into
the
omnibus
with
the
others
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
they
were
round
the
corner
and
stopping
at
their
own
hotel
fairfield
had
selected
the
quirinal
as
a
comfortable
and
convenient
home
for
them
and
when
patty
went
in
and
saw
the
handsomely
appointed
halls
and
picturesque
she
said
this
is
better
than
but
it
isn
t
so
very
roman
after
you
may
as
well
get
rid
of
your
ideas
of
ancient
rome
said
fairfield
there
is
a
little
of
that
left
but
most
of
the
rome
you
ll
have
to
do
with
is
decidedly
twentieth
century
and
very
much
i
believe
you
said
patty
as
she
noticed
the
fashionably
attired
ladies
about
and
the
modern
appliances
everywhere
then
they
were
taken
to
their
rooms
and
patty
exclaimed
with
delight
at
the
pleasant
apartment
reserved
for
them
at
last
i
ve
found
something
different
she
cried
this
isn
t
a
bit
like
our
apartments
in
london
or
paris
oh
nan
do
see
this
gorgeous
gold
furniture
in
our
i
m
sure
the
queen
has
lent
it
for
our
use
while
we
re
here
grand
but
stuffy
declared
nan
as
she
threw
off
her
travelling
cloak
i
like
it
said
patty
it
s
the
first
effect
of
roman
luxury
i
ve
seen
do
we
lie
on
couches
to
eat
father
you
may
if
you
like
my
dear
though
i
believe
it
isn
t
done
much
this
year
in
the
best
patty
went
on
exploring
and
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
novelty
of
her
new
surroundings
there
was
a
grand
furnished
with
heavy
velvet
hangings
and
carpets
massive
furniture
carved
gilded
and
upholstered
in
rich
brocatelles
immense
crystal
chandeliers
elaborate
mirrors
pictures
and
and
a
profusion
of
palms
statuettes
footstools
and
sofa
pillows
from
this
opened
a
small
also
lavishly
decorated
and
furnished
the
and
baths
were
all
in
harmonious
style
and
after
a
tour
of
the
rooms
patty
declared
herself
quite
satisfied
with
the
modern
roman
notions
of
living
and
only
think
said
fairfield
the
price
we
pay
for
all
this
gorgeousness
is
not
so
much
as
we
paid
for
far
simpler
accommodations
in
paris
or
london
oh
let
s
live
in
rome
always
then
cried
patty
enthusiastically
i
love
it
exclaimed
nan
laughing
at
her
raptures
go
and
freshen
yourself
up
get
into
a
comfortable
gown
and
then
we
ll
have
some
half
an
hour
later
the
family
gathered
in
their
own
and
a
delightful
meal
was
served
them
there
patty
and
nan
in
pretty
house
dresses
welcomed
the
delicious
fruits
and
eggs
and
the
coffee
was
pronounced
better
than
that
of
paris
and
as
to
london
said
nan
they
spell
coffee
t
e
so
they
do
said
patty
with
a
wry
face
at
the
recollection
of
london
coffee
give
me
rome
every
time
there
s
this
difference
too
said
fairfield
you
girls
will
have
to
readjust
your
mode
of
living
a
little
in
paris
nobody
gets
around
till
noon
and
then
they
call
luncheon
breakfast
while
here
people
get
up
and
out
fairly
early
in
order
to
utilize
the
morning
hours
which
are
the
best
of
the
day
then
they
come
back
and
stay
indoors
during
the
middle
of
the
day
luncheon
is
promptly
at
twelve
for
that
reason
and
stay
in
the
house
till
three
or
four
o
clock
then
go
out
again
if
you
like
for
the
sunset
how
funny
said
patty
luncheon
at
twelve
is
very
when
you
re
in
rome
you
must
do
as
the
romans
do
said
her
father
and
now
i
ve
told
you
what
that
is
but
you
two
are
not
going
out
at
all
at
least
not
until
four
o
clock
this
afternoon
you
must
rest
this
morning
and
then
at
four
i
ll
take
you
out
for
a
drive
we
re
not
going
to
do
a
lot
of
sightseeing
in
a
rush
and
get
all
tired
out
we
re
here
for
pleasure
and
we
must
take
it
slowly
or
we
can
t
really
enjoy
i
m
agreeable
declared
patty
i
can
spend
the
day
beautifully
unpacking
my
trunk
and
wandering
about
this
hotel
and
taking
a
nap
and
chattering
with
my
stepmother
and
lots
of
things
what
are
you
going
to
do
daddy
i
m
going
out
to
engage
a
roman
chariot
for
you
to
ride
about
in
and
to
have
the
stopped
and
the
railroad
station
made
over
on
a
more
antique
oh
don
t
bother
about
the
station
i
shan
t
need
it
again
till
i
go
home
so
let
it
remain
as
it
very
well
then
now
you
two
be
ready
when
i
come
back
at
noon
and
we
ll
lunch
fairfield
went
away
and
patty
and
nan
went
to
their
work
of
unpacking
patty
was
of
an
orderly
nature
and
really
enjoyed
putting
her
things
neatly
away
in
the
wardrobes
and
drawers
of
which
there
were
plenty
she
was
accustomed
to
wait
on
herself
and
so
declined
the
offers
of
help
from
the
willing
but
unintelligible
maid
who
spoke
no
english
i
suppose
you
re
offering
to
help
me
said
patty
smiling
at
her
but
i
can
t
speak
italian
and
i
d
rather
do
things
myself
the
little
maid
did
not
quite
understand
the
words
but
she
gathered
patty
s
meaning
and
tripped
away
to
make
similar
offers
to
nan
nan
couldn
t
talk
italian
either
but
she
was
inclined
to
have
help
so
by
the
aid
of
smiles
and
gestures
she
quite
made
herself
understood
and
her
rooms
were
soon
in
order
what
a
mess
she
exclaimed
as
a
couple
of
hours
later
she
went
to
patty
s
room
and
found
that
young
woman
in
the
midst
of
a
sea
of
dresses
hats
slippers
and
toilet
accessories
of
all
sorts
a
lovely
mess
returned
patty
placidly
i
ll
soon
straighten
it
out
but
i
never
could
do
it
with
a
roman
trying
to
jabber
out
lucretia
isn
t
choctaw
we
understood
each
other
perfectly
without
words
and
she
s
an
awfully
is
her
name
lucretia
is
she
of
the
old
borgia
crowd
now
she
ll
murder
us
in
our
sleep
like
your
brigand
did
patty
you
ll
never
get
these
clothes
put
away
i
ll
help
so
working
together
the
room
was
soon
tidy
and
patty
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
all
her
belongings
were
put
away
in
proper
order
i
like
them
so
i
can
put
my
hand
on
anything
i
want
in
the
dark
she
said
to
nan
though
indeed
it
s
rarely
i
want
my
books
or
sewing
materials
in
the
dark
or
my
best
hat
for
that
matter
what
would
be
the
use
of
one
s
best
hat
in
the
dark
nobody
could
see
it
but
she
easily
found
the
clothes
she
did
want
and
when
fairfield
returned
he
found
two
very
correct
looking
ladies
in
fresh
white
costumes
ready
to
go
to
luncheon
with
him
i
ve
good
news
for
you
he
said
after
they
were
seated
at
table
i
ran
across
jim
leland
and
he
s
living
here
in
rome
and
he
proposes
to
make
it
pleasant
for
us
in
lots
of
ways
while
we
re
that
s
lovely
said
nan
it
s
always
pleasant
to
know
somebody
who
lives
in
a
place
who
s
he
fred
i
used
to
know
him
twenty
years
ago
but
haven
t
seen
him
since
he
s
a
bachelor
and
has
the
reputation
of
being
somewhat
of
a
recluse
but
i
know
he
ll
be
genial
and
hospitable
where
we
re
concerned
he
and
i
are
good
chums
though
we
don
t
meet
often
he
has
asked
us
to
dine
with
him
some
night
and
i
ve
accepted
for
us
all
on
monday
i
suppose
you
ve
no
other
engagement
patty
not
unless
the
king
asks
me
informally
to
dinner
she
replied
where
does
leland
live
not
far
away
just
across
the
street
in
fact
he
has
bachelor
apartments
where
he
has
lived
for
years
i
they
lingered
over
their
pleasant
luncheon
and
then
strolled
out
to
the
beautiful
garden
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
here
there
were
no
flowers
but
palms
and
strange
tropical
plants
in
great
variety
so
dense
was
the
foliage
in
some
places
that
patty
called
it
a
jungle
and
appropriating
a
wicker
chair
declared
her
intention
of
remaining
there
to
read
for
a
while
do
as
you
choose
until
four
said
her
father
and
then
your
roman
chariot
will
await
the
roman
chariot
proved
to
be
a
low
comfortable
open
carriage
that
fairfield
had
engaged
to
be
at
their
disposal
during
their
whole
stay
in
rome
as
they
started
off
on
their
first
drive
round
the
city
patty
asked
where
they
were
going
not
to
many
places
said
her
father
just
a
drive
to
the
pincio
and
to
get
a
bird
view
of
the
city
but
keep
your
eyes
open
for
this
drive
will
always
remain
in
your
and
it
did
patty
never
forgot
that
first
afternoon
in
rome
she
almost
held
her
breath
as
they
drove
rather
slowly
along
the
streets
and
her
ideas
formed
and
changed
and
fled
so
swiftly
that
she
scarcely
could
be
said
to
have
any
her
conversation
was
limited
to
gasps
of
surprise
and
delight
exclamations
of
awe
and
wonder
and
little
squeals
of
glee
and
merriment
at
last
she
recognised
one
thing
at
least
and
cried
out
oh
isn
t
that
trajan
s
column
it
s
just
like
the
column
good
for
you
said
her
father
to
recognise
it
yes
that
s
it
and
next
to
it
you
may
see
trajan
s
not
a
very
big
one
said
patty
a
little
disappointed
but
very
tidy
and
set
in
neat
well
the
columns
weren
t
just
like
that
to
begin
with
said
fairfield
but
they
ve
been
set
up
in
straight
rows
they
went
on
for
some
distance
and
then
at
a
word
from
fairfield
the
driver
paused
and
stopped
at
a
point
that
commanded
a
fine
view
of
the
coliseum
patty
first
sat
and
looked
at
it
indeed
they
all
sat
silent
looking
at
the
great
structure
as
its
wonderful
lines
stood
out
against
the
blue
sky
i
didn
t
think
it
was
like
that
said
patty
at
last
i
ve
seen
pictures
of
it
but
well
i
don
t
think
it
takes
a
good
picture
no
it
doesn
t
agreed
fairfield
no
photograph
or
painting
of
the
coliseum
can
give
the
least
idea
of
the
calm
sublimity
of
the
building
they
drove
round
it
patty
becoming
more
and
more
deeply
interested
at
every
step
but
fairfield
said
they
would
not
go
inside
that
day
as
he
had
other
plans
so
they
went
on
under
the
great
arch
of
constantine
and
at
this
patty
was
again
dumb
with
awed
admiration
how
big
the
things
are
she
said
and
how
old
added
nan
greatly
impressed
with
the
ancient
monuments
then
they
drove
round
by
the
roman
forum
this
was
altogether
too
much
and
she
gazed
at
it
with
such
a
helpless
expression
on
her
face
that
fairfield
laughed
at
her
drive
on
he
said
to
the
man
we
ll
see
the
forum
some
other
time
well
patty
my
child
is
rome
antique
enough
or
is
it
all
and
railroad
stations
oh
father
said
patty
and
because
of
a
queer
lump
in
her
throat
she
couldn
t
talk
in
her
usual
merry
fashion
there
there
dearie
don
t
take
it
too
seriously
i
want
you
to
love
it
all
but
don
t
let
it
break
you
up
i
can
t
help
it
said
patty
laughing
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
it
s
so
big
so
so
so
overpowering
yes
i
know
but
that
s
why
i
want
you
to
get
used
to
it
by
degrees
now
we
ll
go
through
some
beautiful
gardens
and
on
to
the
away
they
went
along
the
corso
umberto
and
passed
many
statues
villas
buildings
fountains
and
arches
but
none
of
them
so
impressed
patty
as
the
ancient
ruins
had
done
why
is
it
she
asked
her
father
that
the
ruins
are
so
much
more
impressive
than
the
complete
buildings
that
s
partly
glamour
he
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
for
he
remembered
what
patty
had
told
him
of
homer
s
remarks
on
glamour
and
partly
what
else
she
asked
partly
the
grandeur
of
the
monuments
themselves
if
you
hadn
t
been
affected
at
the
sight
of
the
coliseum
i
should
have
packed
you
back
to
new
york
by
the
first
and
i
should
have
deserved
to
go
said
patty
decidedly
i
give
you
both
fair
warning
the
first
thing
i
do
every
morning
while
i
m
in
rome
is
to
go
straight
to
the
coliseum
and
hug
it
after
that
i
ll
go
to
see
the
other
can
you
reach
all
the
way
around
it
asked
nan
smiling
don
t
be
too
literal
said
patty
smiling
back
i
shall
only
hug
it
figuratively
but
oh
i
do
love
it
the
venus
of
milo
has
a
rival
in
my
affections
no
not
a
rival
exactly
for
they
re
too
different
to
be
compared
but
they
re
both
my
favourite
that
s
one
way
to
put
it
laughed
her
father
but
here
we
are
on
the
top
of
the
pincian
hill
will
you
get
out
and
have
some
cakes
and
ices
they
did
so
and
patty
found
it
delightful
to
sit
at
one
of
the
little
tables
under
the
trees
and
have
a
roman
afternoon
tea
there
were
a
great
many
people
about
some
of
whom
looked
like
americans
and
patty
noticed
two
or
three
who
belonged
in
their
own
hotel
shall
we
get
acquainted
with
any
of
the
people
at
the
hotel
she
asked
yes
i
think
so
nan
answered
there
are
some
people
from
philadelphia
there
whom
i
know
slightly
i
think
i
ll
look
them
up
oh
of
course
we
ll
make
acquaintances
sooner
or
later
said
fairfield
the
coliseum
is
chum
enough
for
me
said
patty
with
a
dreamy
look
i
don
t
care
for
anybody
glamour
has
hit
you
hard
said
her
father
we
d
better
be
going
home
and
give
you
a
change
of
chapter
vii
american
friends
and
others
she
s
coming
announced
patty
as
the
family
sat
at
luncheon
some
days
later
who
s
coming
asked
nan
looking
up
from
her
own
letters
they
were
all
reading
their
mail
which
usually
arrived
about
midday
why
flo
carrington
and
her
governess
whom
she
always
calls
i
don
t
know
what
the
lady
s
real
name
good
said
fairfield
i
ll
be
glad
for
you
to
have
a
young
companion
and
madame
snippy
can
probably
look
after
you
or
flo
and
i
can
look
after
her
observed
patty
i
ve
never
met
the
lady
but
i
think
she
goes
around
with
her
nose
in
a
book
i
ve
always
heard
of
her
widespread
knowledge
of
all
that
will
be
a
good
thing
for
you
said
her
father
you
re
not
overburdened
with
booklore
and
though
this
is
a
pleasure
trip
for
you
i
hope
you
ll
acquire
some
information

not

m
sure

most
interesting
you
see
flo
knows
it
all
she
has
all
history
at
her
tongue
s
end
and
she
knows
all
about
the
great
works
of
art
and

recite
the
names
of
the

asked
nan
smiling
oh
she
doesn
t
know
it
that
way
no
half
hours
with
the
best
artists

she

a
good
chum
for
you

so
glad

lot
with

nan
to
flock
by
yourselves
won
t
you
be
lonesome
if
we
are
we
ll
tag
after
you
said
nan
patty
i
think
that
i
ll
introduce
ourselves
to
those
people
over
there
they
re
the
van
winkles
from
philadelphia
and
i
met
van
winkle
some
years
ago
though
she
may
not
remember
me
but
i
think
she
does
for
she
has
smiled
pleasantly
two
or
three
all
right
nan
i
ll
go
with
you
let
s
go
right
after
luncheon
if
they
stop
in
the
as
they
probably
will
daddy
can
make
himself
invisible
behind
a
newspaper
until
we
call
him
into
the
so
as
they
rose
from
the
table
and
passed
through
the
which
was
also
a
favourite
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
they
found
the
van
winkles
had
paused
there
and
were
having
their
coffee
at
a
small
table
nan
soon
discovered
that
van
winkle
did
indeed
remember
her
and
that
they
were
all
glad
to
become
better
acquainted
fairfield
was
summoned
to
join
the
group
and
a
pleasant
hour
followed
the
van
winkle
family
consisted
of
the
father
and
mother
also
a
son
and
daughter
patty
liked
the
young
people
and
was
much
amused
to
learn
that
the
young
man
whom
his
sister
called
lank
was
really
named
lancaster
the
girl
s
name
was
violet
and
she
explained
that
she
chose
it
herself
because
it
went
so
well
with
van
winkle
i
really
had
no
name
until
i
was
about
ten
she
said
they
always
called
me
birdie
or
tottie
or
some
foolish
pet
name
but
i
liked
violet
so
i
just
took
it
s
a
pretty
name
said
patty
with
amiable
intent
and
lancaster
is
a
pretty
name
yes
said
violet
but
we
call
him
lank
because
he
s
so
fat
and
he
was
a
stout
young
man
and
of
a
very
countenance
he
seemed
to
admire
patty
and
soon
they
all
fell
into
easy
conversation
have
you
been
here
long
asked
patty
nearly
a
month
said
violet
we
were
thinking
of
going
on
next
week
but
now
that
we
ve
met
you
i
d
like
to
stay
i
hope
you
will
said
patty
cordially
i
ve
a
friend
coming
in
a
few
days
and
i
know
we
could
all
have
a
good
time
together
i
love
a
lot
of
people
don
t
you
i
do
if
they
pull
together
said
lank
but
if
you
start
out
with
a
bunch
of
people
they
never
all
want
to
go
to
the
same
place
at
the
same
i
suppose
that
s
so
said
patty
but
i
ve
only
my
father
and
mother
in
my
party
at
present
and
we
go
together
of
course
but
i
ve
not
seen
much
yet
we
ve
only
been
here
a
few
days
and
i
ve
spent
most
of
the
time
in
the
coliseum
and
roman
forum
i
do
love
them
so
and
i
go
there
expecting
to
study
out
the
ruins
and
columns
and
then
i
forget
all
about
studying
and
just
wander
about
thinking
of
the
old
romans
who
used
to
be
that
s
what
i
do
exclaimed
lank
i
m
mad
about
the
forum
and
i
just
shuffle
around
it
with
my
tongue
out
sort
of
lapping
it
he
does
said
violet
laughing
you
ought
to
see
him
he
looks
like
an
i
d
rather
look
like
an
idiot
than
a
tourist
said
lancaster
a
little
resentfully
don
t
worry
said
patty
i
m
sure
you
don
t
look
the
least
like
a
tourist
i
know
you
don
t
keep
one
forefinger
stuck
into
a
baedeker
and
the
other
no
i
don
t
but
and
the
boy
s
eyes
twinkled
i
carry
a
pack
of
postcards
instead
of
a
baedeker
good
for
you
cried
patty
i
love
postcards
they
re
so
useful
said
violet
to
direct
your
cabman
where
to
go
the
cabmen
never
talk
english
but
if
you
show
a
postcard
they
take
you
right
to
the
place
go
out
with
us
won
t
you
and
let
s
visit
the
forum
together
indeed
i
will
said
patty
i
d
love
to
but
i
suppose
i
must
start
in
on
the
churches
pretty
soon
i
ll
admire
them
i
expect
but
i
know
they
won
t
take
hold
of
me
as
the
ruins
so
the
ruins
have
caught
you
have
they
said
a
deep
voice
behind
patty
s
chair
and
turning
quickly
she
saw
peter
homer
smiling
down
at
her
mr
homer
she
cried
delightedly
as
she
jumped
up
to
greet
him
i
told
you
i
d
appear
sooner
or
later
he
said
smiling
at
her
surprise
and
i
m
glad
you
came
as
soon
as
you
did
she
replied
merrily
and
then
she
introduced
him
to
the
van
winkles
and
and
fairfield
added
their
welcome
i
m
just
here
on
one
of
my
said
homer
by
way
of
explaining
his
sudden
appearance
every
few
years
i
run
down
to
rome
and
wander
about
wondering
it
s
a
most
satisfying
occupation
and
i
never
tire
of
that
s
a
good
expression
said
patty
thoughtfully
i
believe
i
d
rather
wander
around
and
wonder
than
to
know
it
it
s
a
whole
lot
easier
said
lank
van
winkle
lets
you
out
of
a
lot
of
and
gives
you
equally
good
results
said
homer
a
short
cut
and
a
merry
one
is
my
creed
to
knowledge
or
across
a
street
or
wherever
you
don
t
seem
to
pursue
that
plan
in
your
book
said
patty
smiling
oh
my
book
that
s
intended
for
other
people
so
i
can
t
consult
my
own
inclinations
in
the
matter
but
when
i
m
away
on
my
wanderings
and
wonderings
i
try
to
forget
those
twenty
volumes
and
pretend
i
m
entirely
that
s
right
said
van
winkle
approvingly
when
you
take
a
vacation
take
it
thoroughly
that
s
what
i
m
doing
i
ve
forgotten
that
i
have
a
business
office
in
the
united
states
and
i
ve
become
temporarily
a
roman
citizen
are
you
staying
at
this
hotel
homer
no
my
fate
decrees
an
humbler
home
but
i
m
comfortably
housed
only
a
few
blocks
away
and
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
all
again
now
i
must
pursue
my
wanderings
as
i
have
an
engagement
shortly
by
the
way
miss
fairfield
did
you
know
your
friend
floyd
austin
is
on
his
way
here
really
said
patty
how
delightful
we
can
have
a
roman
reunion
for
miss
carrington
is
coming
yes
i
know
it
and
caddy
oram
is
with
austin
we
must
have
a
meeting
of
the
clan
we
will
said
patty
i
ll
invite
you
all
to
tea
as
soon
as
flo
arrives
and
we
ll
have
a
lovely
don
t
you
always
have
a
lovely
time
asked
peter
homer
as
he
said
to
patty
yes
indeed
she
replied
and
in
rome
who
could
help
it
no
one
with
eyes
he
said
and
which
has
pleased
you
more
so
far
the
glamour
or
the
ruins
patty
thought
a
moment
i
can
t
distinguish
them
she
said
at
last
they
re
so
mixed
up
with
each
other
and
both
so
homer
smiled
that
s
as
it
should
be
he
said
but
if
i
may
i
d
like
to
wonder
at
little
with
you
what
are
you
doing
morning
going
to
the
forum
with
the
two
van
winkles
answered
patty
won
t
you
go
with
us
i
ll
be
glad
to
suppose
i
meet
you
here
at
ten
o
do
that
will
be
fine
i
ve
only
just
met
the
van
winkles
but
i
like
them
yes
they
re
attractive
people
said
homer
a
little
absently
and
then
he
went
away
although
peter
homer
was
only
about
and
the
van
winkles
were
near
patty
s
age
he
seemed
much
older
than
the
other
three
patty
realised
this
and
attributed
it
to
his
really
serious
and
scholarly
nature
which
he
hid
behind
his
pretence
of
taking
everything
lightly
she
liked
the
man
very
much
for
he
was
most
interesting
and
amusing
but
he
sometimes
had
a
preoccupied
air
which
made
patty
feel
young
and
ignorant
well
he
can
go
with
us
she
thought
and
if
he
thinks
we
re
not
wise
enough
for
him
he
needn
t
go
it
was
the
evening
they
were
to
dine
at
leland
s
and
patty
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
a
visit
to
a
real
roman
home
of
course
she
said
to
nan
i
don
t
mean
ancient
roman
i
ve
learned
better
than
to
look
for
couches
instead
of
dining
chairs
but
i
think
it
will
be
fun
to
see
how
an
american
lives
in
so
patty
ran
away
to
her
room
to
dress
for
the
dinner
party
she
chose
a
white
chiffon
with
a
round
neck
and
a
skirt
that
billowed
into
soft
frills
and
to
it
she
added
a
beautiful
roman
sash
that
she
had
bought
that
very
day
she
was
peacocking
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
long
mirror
when
nan
came
in
i
suppose
i
m
too
grown
up
to
wear
a
roman
sash
said
patty
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
the
soft
silk
ends
with
their
knotted
fringe
but
the
colours
are
so
lovely
and
it
seems
by
all
means
wear
it
if
you
like
said
nan
it
s
a
beautiful
one
and
anyway
i
don
t
suppose
leland
will
know
a
sash
from
a
patty
laughed
at
this
and
concluded
to
wear
her
sash
you
ll
be
wasted
on
him
then
she
added
for
you
do
look
bewitching
in
that
mauve
nan
did
look
lovely
in
her
pretty
evening
gown
and
fairfield
had
reason
to
feel
proud
of
the
two
ladies
he
escorted
downstairs
don
t
bother
with
that
ridiculous
elevator
said
patty
as
she
led
the
way
to
the
staircase
i
think
its
rheumatism
is
bad
it
grunts
fearfully
and
limps
like
it
never
seems
well
on
mondays
said
nan
sympathetically
i
think
it
s
overworked
poor
overworked
put
in
fairfield
it
makes
about
three
round
trips
each
i
like
better
to
walk
down
anyway
said
patty
these
staircases
are
so
red
velvety
and
white
and
and
with
a
hop
skip
and
jump
she
landed
on
the
lower
hall
floor
behave
yourself
patty
admonished
nan
don
t
jump
around
like
an
infant
even
if
you
are
wearing
a
little
girl
s
i
ve
learned
said
patty
with
an
air
of
great
wisdom
that
an
american
young
woman
in
rome
may
do
anything
she
chooses
and
she
is
excused
just
because
she
s
don
t
you
believe
it
said
her
father
you
behave
yourself
properly
or
you
can
t
go
dining
out
with
your
elders
then
you
can
t
go
cried
irrepressible
patty
for
you
can
t
leave
me
alone
either
but
patty
s
manners
were
really
above
reproach
and
it
was
a
most
correctly
behaved
american
girl
who
entered
leland
s
that
gentleman
proved
to
be
a
man
of
about
fairfield
s
age
and
he
was
delighted
to
welcome
guests
from
his
native
land
to
humour
my
health
he
said
i
have
lived
in
rome
for
many
years
but
my
heart
is
still
true
to
the
old
flag
and
i
wish
i
might
go
back
and
live
beneath
its
red
white
and
but
wouldn
t
you
hate
to
give
up
all
this
splendour
asked
patty
glancing
about
at
the
unusually
fine
apartment
yes
and
no
replied
leland
smiling
i
ve
collected
my
household
gods
with
great
care
and
they
wouldn
t
bear
transplanting
to
america
but
still
my
native
heath
calls
loudly
to
me
at
why
couldn
t
you
take
all
these
beautiful
things
home
with
you
asked
nan
i
could
but
they
wouldn
t
feel
at
home
in
an
american
house
imagine
these
rooms
transported
bodily
to
new
york
they
would
appear
bizarre
and
while
here
they
are
that
s
one
reason
i
love
rome
said
patty
enthusiastically
it
s
all
red
velvet
and
carved
gold
frames
and
marble
and
heavy
tapestries
and
mosaic
floors
oh
i
adore
it
you
ve
a
barbaric
love
of
colour
said
leland
smiling
unusual
in
a
young
american
girl
but
you
must
remember
that
all
this
colour
and
gilding
is
only
right
under
the
blue
and
gold
of
the
italian
sky
in
new
york
it
would
be
a
jarring
patty
sighed
unconsciously
for
she
began
to
realise
there
was
a
great
deal
to
know
of
which
she
was
entirely
ignorant
don
t
take
it
too
seriously
child
said
leland
reading
her
thought
remember
i
ve
spent
twenty
years
learning
these
things
and
you
ve
not
even
begun
yet
i
m
sure
your
natural
instincts
are
fairly
true
all
you
need
is
instruction
and
experience
have
you
seen
peter
s
yes
said
patty
but
i
ve
only
bowed
to
it
i
haven
t
shaken
hands
with
it
yet
but
i
know
one
thing
about
it
somebody
told
me
it
s
leland
smiled
and
said
not
at
all
unkindly
whoever
told
you
that
was
utterly
ignorant
of
the
real
meaning
of
in
no
sense
does
it
apply
to
peter
s
that
church
my
dear
child
if
anybody
asks
you
is
is
what
exclaimed
patty
flubdubby
in
the
extreme
i
may
say
it
s
pure
flubdub
if
you
want
to
impress
any
one
with
your
knowledge
of
architecture
say
that
and
you
ll
hit
the
nail
on
the
patty
was
almost
afraid
her
host
was
making
fun
of
her
but
his
earnest
manner
proved
he
was
not
we
won
t
go
into
details
now
he
said
but
some
day
i
ll
take
you
there
and
show
you
what
i
dinner
was
served
then
and
patty
went
into
a
that
made
her
feel
as
if
she
had
been
transplanted
to
china
itself
it
was
really
a
remarkable
room
the
walls
were
hung
with
marvellous
satin
embroideries
that
had
belonged
to
the
empress
dowager
of
china
and
the
screens
and
chairs
were
covered
with
the
same
exquisite
handiwork
bronzes
and
pottery
of
rare
values
were
everywhere
and
all
of
the
dinner
service
was
of
porcelain
silver
and
gold
that
had
once
graced
the
tables
in
royal
palaces
patty
was
so
enraptured
looking
at
the
beautiful
and
curious
things
she
had
no
appetite
for
the
viands
that
were
offered
her
by
celestials
you
are
more
susceptible
to
beauty
and
colour
than
any
one
i
ever
saw
miss
fairfield
said
her
host
after
he
had
covertly
watched
patty
s
shining
eyes
she
is
declared
her
father
from
a
child
she
has
loved
pretty
things
and
she
has
a
perfect
passion
for
bright
but
always
with
a
good
sense
of
colour
values
put
in
nan
lest
leland
should
think
patty
a
little
barbarian
i
m
sure
of
that
he
said
kindly
and
i
shall
hope
miss
fairfield
to
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
you
some
of
the
most
beautiful
things
in
rome
which
are
not
shown
except
to
appreciative
patty
s
appreciative
eyes
danced
at
this
for
she
knew
leland
was
a
man
of
influence
and
could
take
her
to
many
places
where
strangers
were
not
usually
allowed
after
dinner
a
delightful
evening
was
spent
viewing
the
treasures
collected
by
their
host
on
his
many
trips
to
oriental
countries
and
patty
became
more
and
more
awed
at
his
extensive
knowledge
of
the
art
works
of
all
ages
and
countries
i
don
t
see
how
you
remember
it
all
she
said
looking
at
him
earnestly
i
should
think
you
d
have
to
have
a
head
as
big
as
the
coliseum
and
you
haven
t
no
one
can
have
the
big
head
said
leland
smiling
when
he
realises
the
great
minds
and
great
geniuses
who
have
produced
these
wonderful
no
said
patty
and
i
can
t
even
appreciate
it
i
can
only
chapter
viii
playing
house
it
was
a
merry
party
of
four
that
started
off
next
morning
to
visit
the
roman
forum
in
the
spacious
open
carriage
patty
and
violet
sat
facing
lancaster
and
homer
and
they
drove
slowly
through
the
streets
of
rome
remarking
their
favourite
points
of
interest
on
either
side
first
let
s
go
and
hug
the
coliseum
said
patty
so
they
went
in
that
direction
want
to
go
in
asked
peter
homer
as
they
approached
the
entrance
no
not
said
patty
i
ll
just
give
it
a
good
squeeze
so
it
will
know
i
haven
t
forgotten
patty
spread
her
arms
toward
the
great
structure
her
blue
eyes
filled
with
loving
affection
i
hope
your
somewhat
dilapidated
friend
appreciates
your
devotion
remarked
peter
smiling
at
patty
s
fervour
it
isn
t
dilapidated
she
retorted
it
has
only
just
reached
the
perfection
of
old
age
said
violet
i
love
it
too
but
i
m
not
as
idiotic
about
it
as
patty
i
see
its
i
don
t
insisted
patty
stoutly
for
it
hasn
t
good
for
you
cried
lank
that
s
true
loyalty
not
to
see
the
imperfections
of
your
friends
whether
they
have
any
or
not
but
here
s
the
forum
fairly
running
to
meet
oh
isn
t
it
great
exclaimed
patty
as
she
looked
eagerly
at
the
picturesque
ruins
standing
out
sharply
against
the
blue
italian
sky
what
was
the
forum
for
in
the
first
place
asked
violet
in
earliest
times
it
was
a
said
peter
but
later
oh
broke
in
the
irrepressible
patty
then
i
suppose
this
little
roman
went
to
market
this
little
roman
staid
but
no
little
roman
had
roast
beef
said
lank
at
least
i
suppose
they
might
have
done
so
but
it
doesn
t
seem
they
had
it
i
m
sure
said
violet
but
under
a
different
name
didn
t
they
homer
probably
they
seemed
to
have
everything
that
was
good
to
eat
and
some
things
that
weren
as
the
party
intended
to
spend
the
whole
morning
in
the
forum
they
dismissed
their
cab
at
the
entrance
now
said
peter
homer
as
they
went
down
among
the
ruins
we
won
t
have
any
maps
or
guidebooks
we
ll
just
wander
around
and
but
you
know
what
all
the
ruins
are
don
t
you
asked
patty
oh
yes
i
know
the
names
of
the
temples
and
things
i
ll
tell
you
those
as
we
come
to
them
this
noble
collection
of
pedestals
was
once
the
basilica
let
s
play
house
said
patty
promptly
i
ll
be
julia
and
live
here
i
d
love
to
be
a
roman
but
the
julia
in
question
wasn
t
a
roman
matron
said
peter
in
fact
this
basilica
was
named
in
honour
of
julius
oh
said
patty
and
they
called
him
julia
as
a
pet
name
i
suppose
how
sweet
of
them
we
can
play
house
just
the
same
said
violet
i
ll
live
in
the
temple
of
saturn
it
s
roomy
and
well
ventilated
what
do
you
choose
homer
i
ll
live
under
the
arch
of
septimius
severus
it
s
not
so
large
but
it
s
roofed
in
case
of
the
temple
of
vespasian
for
mine
said
lank
it
isn
t
in
very
good
repair
but
perhaps
the
landlord
will
fix
it
up
and
anyway
i
ll
be
near
sister
if
she
wants
and
so
these
four
ridiculous
young
people
went
to
their
chosen
abodes
patty
surveyed
the
wide
expanse
of
her
house
with
satisfaction
and
then
taking
a
pack
of
postcards
from
her
bag
proceeded
to
identify
the
different
monuments
soon
violet
came
flying
over
how
do
you
do
madame
julia
she
said
is
the
honorable
cæsar
at
home
no
said
patty
rising
with
great
dignity
and
bowing
to
her
guest
he
had
to
go
to
market
to
the
forum
i
mean
it
s
his
day
to
make
a
speech
to
the
senate
or
i
ve
brought
my
cards
said
violet
dropping
back
into
a
modern
american
mood
don
t
you
get
the
columns
mixed
up
yes
i
do
said
patty
but
i
don
t
care
much
you
can
wonder
better
if
you
re
not
sure
of
your
of
course
you
can
said
homer
who
with
young
van
winkle
came
just
then
within
hearing
of
the
two
girls
pardon
my
interruption
madame
julia
but
i
ve
brought
a
roman
senator
to
call
on
you
allow
me
to
present
augustus
van
winkleinus
from
the
ancient
city
of
ha
said
patty
methinks
we
have
met
aforetime
art
not
lankius
the
rotund
i
art
not
declared
lank
i
art
but
a
stripling
a
one
forsooth
said
patty
laughing
good
nature
but
bad
art
said
violet
peterus
homerus
what
is
the
noble
building
next
us
with
its
three
columns
left
standing
i
know
cried
patty
it
s
the
temple
of
castor
and
don
t
call
it
that
said
homer
just
say
the
temple
of
castor
it
sounds
better
to
trained
all
right
i
will
said
patty
what
was
it
for
anyway
for
various
commercial
uses
indeed
it
was
a
sort
of
an
office
building
at
one
time
it
contained
the
for
weights
and
measures
but
that
doesn
t
add
to
its
interest
just
look
at
the
blue
sky
between
those
perfect
columns
and
let
that
be
your
only
memory
of
the
temple
of
isn
t
it
strange
said
patty
reminiscently
you
said
you
wished
you
could
show
me
italy
in
your
own
way
and
here
you
are
doing
it
yes
and
i
m
glad
i
have
the
opportunity
how
do
you
like
my
way
i
love
it
said
patty
but
all
ways
lead
to
rome
so
i
suppose
that
s
how
you
happened
to
get
here
just
i
suppose
so
returned
homer
but
senator
lancastrius
van
winkleius
and
i
came
over
to
invite
you
roman
matrons
to
dine
with
us
in
my
triumphal
arch
will
you
come
what
have
you
to
dine
on
asked
violet
ah
that
s
the
triumph
you
come
and
see
it
isn
t
correct
to
ask
your
host
such
a
so
the
four
proceeded
to
the
arch
of
severus
and
there
on
some
stones
they
found
a
box
of
sandwiches
and
a
small
pile
of
fruit
primitive
service
but
good
food
remarked
peter
and
the
girls
suddenly
realised
that
they
had
a
fine
appetite
this
is
great
declared
patty
as
she
sat
on
an
old
block
of
marble
with
a
sandwich
in
one
hand
and
a
bunch
of
grapes
in
the
other
i
approve
of
your
method
of
seeing
italy
and
i
think
a
triumphal
arch
the
best
place
in
the
world
to
eat
and
then
you
see
said
peter
it
fixes
this
particular
arch
in
your
mind
and
when
wiseacres
speak
of
septimius
severus
you
can
say
to
yourself
ah
yes
his
is
the
arch
of
the
i
shall
never
forget
it
said
violet
helping
herself
to
some
fruit
i
feel
a
personal
friendship
for
old
incidentally
went
on
peter
you
may
as
well
fasten
in
your
memory
the
facts
that
this
arch
was
built
about
in
commemoration
of
the
victorious
wars
of
our
friend
severus
these
not
very
beautiful
sculpturings
represent
his
soldiers
but
as
art
had
begun
to
decline
when
these
figures
were
cut
you
needn
t
bother
about
them
i
think
they
re
rather
nice
said
patty
examining
the
multitudinous
small
figures
in
but
i
m
glad
i
haven
t
to
learn
all
their
names
for
there
are
so
many
more
attractive
there
are
indeed
but
i
want
you
to
remember
the
arch
as
a
whole
and
now
that
you
ve
eaten
every
last
crumb
step
outside
and
take
a
look
at
the
beautiful
the
quartette
lined
up
facing
the
arch
and
peter
pointed
out
its
special
points
of
beauty
and
excellence
where
is
there
another
arch
very
similar
to
this
he
asked
at
length
and
his
three
hearers
tried
to
think
i
know
said
patty
her
eyes
shining
it
s
in
paris
not
the
arc
de
triomphe
that
has
only
one
front
door
but
the
other
the
arc
du
carrousel
right
you
are
said
peter
approvingly
the
arc
du
carrousel
was
modelled
after
this
one
remember
that
when
you
have
a
remembering
but
the
carrousel
one
has
a
flight
of
horses
on
top
said
patty
right
again
my
acute
observer
however
severus
once
had
six
fine
horses
and
a
chariot
on
top
of
this
one
also
a
statue
of
himself
and
his
two
sons
so
you
see
it
s
a
bit
of
a
ruin
after
it
is
so
said
violet
so
much
so
that
until
now
i
ve
liked
the
arch
of
constantine
better
but
now
that
s
tottering
on
its
oh
that
arch
is
all
right
declared
lank
i
ll
never
go
back
on
constantine
s
triumphal
there
s
a
arch
modelled
after
that
too
said
peter
where
is
it
my
children
but
none
of
the
three
could
answer
that
so
peter
said
well
you
are
a
brilliant
class
why
the
marble
arch
in
london
of
pooh
said
patty
that
s
no
more
like
constantine
s
arch
than
chalk
s
like
nevertheless
it
was
patterned
from
then
they
must
have
carried
the
pattern
in
their
heads
why
the
marble
arch
is
all
white
and
smug
and
sharp
edges
and
constantine
s
is
all
lovely
and
brown
and
gummy
yes
sort
of
fuzzy
and
crumbly
not
as
if
it
had
just
been
washed
up
by
a
like
the
marble
your
language
is
not
truly
technical
but
i
m
glad
you
have
a
feeling
for
arches
said
peter
laughing
at
patty
s
scornful
face
deed
i
have
let
s
go
back
and
look
at
constantine
s
arch
while
we
have
this
one
in
come
on
let
s
do
that
same
said
lank
and
then
we
must
be
getting
back
to
our
bereaved
so
we
must
said
patty
i
forgot
all
about
going
home
well
old
sandwich
man
you
put
up
a
arch
i
and
my
hotel
chef
put
up
sandwiches
i
think
said
peter
they
were
so
said
violet
enthusiastically
i
don
t
know
how
you
happened
to
think
we
d
be
oh
when
people
want
bread
they
re
not
satisfied
with
stones
not
even
carved
ones
said
peter
and
then
they
all
trudged
slowly
up
the
toward
the
entrance
gate
patty
kicked
affectionately
at
the
fragments
of
columns
and
bits
of
carved
marble
that
bordered
the
path
i
wonder
where
that
used
to
be
she
said
pausing
before
a
broken
stone
face
which
showed
only
the
mouth
and
chin
right
under
somebody
s
nose
said
lank
with
a
grin
and
violet
reproved
him
for
being
so
foolish
i
like
foolishness
said
patty
smiling
at
the
boy
but
i
mean
i
wonder
where
the
whole
statue
you
may
as
well
wonder
about
that
as
anything
else
said
peter
i
m
wondering
if
we
can
find
a
cab
that
will
leisurely
convey
us
by
way
of
constantine
s
arch
reminded
patty
they
soon
found
a
carriage
and
the
four
climbed
in
let
s
be
a
club
said
patty
who
loved
to
organise
things
then
we
can
go
and
see
things
not
very
regularly
the
way
we
see
them
said
peter
but
i
ll
join
your
club
shall
we
call
it
the
roamin
club
a
howl
of
derision
greeted
this
jest
and
lank
added
to
the
fun
by
saying
no
let
s
just
call
it
the
romers
and
then
we
can
rome
all
don
t
be
idiotic
said
violet
i
propose
the
wanderers
club
that
s
more
but
there
s
been
a
wanderers
club
objected
patty
how
about
the
wonderers
club
instead
capital
said
peter
just
the
wonderers
then
we
can
wonder
as
much
as
we
like
while
we
re
flo
will
have
to
belong
to
it
said
patty
she
s
coming
anybody
can
belong
said
peter
who
is
willing
to
shall
we
have
regular
meetings
asked
violet
oh
dear
no
said
patty
we
won
t
have
anything
regular
about
it
we
ll
just
meet
when
we
feel
like
it
and
go
wondering
about
the
fun
will
be
said
peter
wondering
when
the
next
meeting
will
take
and
wondering
where
it
will
be
added
patty
they
drove
home
slowly
here
and
there
catching
glimpses
of
wonderful
perspectives
and
splendid
vistas
to
which
peter
homer
called
their
attention
in
his
casual
humorous
way
patty
said
little
but
leaning
back
in
the
rather
bumpy
old
vehicle
she
revelled
in
the
beauty
all
around
her
and
stored
it
away
in
her
memory
for
future
years
we
ve
had
a
perfect
morning
said
patty
as
she
joined
her
parents
at
luncheon
peter
homer
we
all
call
each
other
by
our
first
names
now
is
the
loveliest
man
to
go
about
with
he
knows
everything
but
he
never
flings
information
at
you
till
you
want
a
fine
trait
observed
her
father
i
m
like
that
yes
you
are
daddy
said
patty
with
an
affectionate
glance
but
even
you
don
t
know
the
books
full
of
wise
stuff
that
he
does
and
he
s
so
kind
and
he
does
seem
to
possess
all
the
virtues
said
nan
and
i
m

i
can
tell
a
few
hours
later
patty
was
lying
down
in
her
own
room
resting
after
her
morning
s
excursion
when
she
was
roused
by
a
tap
at
the
door
she
jumped
up
and
opened
it
and
there
was
the
smiling
face
of
flo
carrington

cried
bouncing
into
the
room
and
flinging
both
arms
round

she
rose
to
curtsey
she
was
a
old
lady
one
that
might
be
characterised
as
a
dragon
but
she
had
a
gleam
of
humour
in
her
eye
which
went
to
patty
s
heart
at
once

been
to
rome

patty

way
of
making
conversation

velvet
hangings

thick
carpets

from
wall
to
wall

said
patty
though
conscious
of
a
feeling
that
flo
might
sometimes
be
an
insistent
companion
but
she
was
ashamed
of
this
thought
as
soon
as
it
came
and
said
cordially

holiday

asked
patty
in
her
most
wheedlesome
way
but
the
stern
englishwoman
shut
her
lips
together
with
a
snap
and
then
opened
them
to
say
no
miss
fairfield
i
have
my
wow
thought
patty
after
she
had
returned
to
her
own
room

glad

to
travel
with
a
duenna

snippy
chapter
ix
a
roman
tea
patty
had
decided
to
have
her
tea
in
the
garden
of
the
hotel
and
a
portion
had
been
set
aside
for
her
use
light
tables
and
chairs
nestled
cosily
among
the
great
palms
and
tropical
plants
and
growing
flowers
made
masses
of
bloom
here
and
there
the
orchestra
just
far
enough
away
to
be
pleasant
had
been
engaged
to
play
at
intervals
including
some
american
airs
with
their
other
selections
the
collation
had
been
carefully
chosen
and
after
an
inspection
of
the
place
to
see
that
everything
was
satisfactory
patty
went
to
dress
for
the
event
do
you
remember
smarty
s
party
she
said
pausing
in
nan
s
room
whose
why
there
s
a
classic
poem
something
like
this
smarty
had
a
party
nobody
came
ceptin
smarty
and
my
tea
will
be
like
that
the
garden
looks
lovely
the
cakes
and
ices
are
dreams
of
beauty
and
i
mean
to
be
a
charming
hostess
but
alas
my
guests
are
so
who
are
coming
every
one
you
know
in
rome
i
yes
but
that
s
only
flo
and
the
van
winkles
and
homer
oh
yes
i
asked
leland
but
i
don
t
know
as
he
ll
come
and
violet
asked
leave
to
bring
milly
mills
some
girl
she
knows
whose
mother
is
an
invalid
so
milly
can
t
go
out
well
you
ll
have
more
guests
than
smarty
had
said
nan
consolingly
and
your
father
and
i
and
and
valentine
will
make
a
fine
background
of
elderly
yes
you
re
a
fine
old
dowager
duchess
said
patty
smiling
at
pretty
nan
with
your
roseleaf
skin
and
your
nose
you
look
more
like
a
how
foolish
you
are
said
nan
blushing
and
dimpling
as
she
always
did
at
patty
s
chaffing
compliments
which
were
nevertheless
sincere
patty
was
getting
into
her
frock
a
soft
liberty
silk
of
a
lovely
pale
green
when
an
impatient
knock
came
at
her
door
and
before
she
could
open
it
flo
flung
it
open
and
fairly
rushed
in
patty
fairfield
she
cried
what
do
you
think
that
outrageous
snippy
says
i
can
t
go
to
your
tea
because
i
haven
t
done
my
practising
she
says
i
can
go
later
but
i
must
practise
for
an
hour
first
and
i
won
t
do
it
i
should
say
not
cried
patty
in
a
burst
of
righteous
indignation
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
horrid
of
course
you
ll
coax
her
around
coax
snippy
you
don
t
know
her
you
see
i
went
wondering
with
you
all
this
morning
and
since
luncheon
i
ve
been
napping
and
now
i
want
to
get
ready
for
the
and
you
must
come
i
ll
go
with
you
and
try
to
persuade
old
no
that
won
t
do
any
good
but
here
s
my
plan
once
in
a
great
while
when
i
feel
very
dreadfully
put
out
i
turn
on
her
and
scare
the
wits
out
of
her
not
often
or
it
would
lose
all
effect
but
i
m
going
to
do
it
now
do
if
you
like
come
with
me
and
see
the
patty
felt
a
little
ashamed
at
such
strenuous
measures
but
she
followed
flo
through
the
halls
by
the
piano
in
flo
s
stood
snippy
a
majestic
figure
of
towering
wrath
and
immovable
determination
miss
patty
she
said
not
uncivilly
but
coldly
miss
flo
will
come
to
your
tea
a
bit
late
as
she
has
her
music
to
i
m
not
going
to
practise
remarked
flo
carelessly
yes
miss
flo
you
are
not
a
step
do
you
go
from
this
room
till
your
hour
is
then
flo
turned
to
her
governess
and
looked
her
straight
in
the
eye
snippy
she
said
in
firm
even
tones
i
am
not
going
to
practise
nor
nor
next
day
and
perhaps
never
again
hush
don
t
you
speak
i
m
going
to
patty
s
tea
now
do
you
hear
flo
s
voice
grew
a
little
louder
and
she
took
a
step
toward
snippy
and
shook
a
warning
forefinger
at
her
you
have
your
orders
i
know
but
in
this
case
you
take
orders
from
me
me
i
wish
to
dress
at
once
and
you
will
lay
out
my
dresden
silk
with
the
pink
bows
now
you
perhaps
it
was
the
explosive
way
in
which
she
pronounced
the
last
word
but
at
any
rate
snippy
jumped
as
if
she
had
been
shot
and
with
a
vanquished
air
went
to
the
wardrobe
for
flo
s
dress
patty
overcome
with
amusement
at
the
scene
slipped
away
lest
her
presence
prove
embarrassing
to
the
conquered
spirit
but
she
needn
t
have
feared
snippy
s
nature
had
a
touch
of
arrogance
and
presumption
because
of
her
responsible
position
and
when
flo
thus
asserted
herself
the
stern
old
lady
felt
the
justice
of
it
and
met
the
situation
bravely
yes
miss
flo
she
said
and
shall
i
do
your
hair
with
bands
or
a
fringe
so
the
incident
was
closed
and
never
again
referred
to
and
flo
tranquilly
did
her
practising
every
day
thereafter
isn
t
she
funny
said
patty
as
the
two
sat
in
the
garden
waiting
for
the
guests
to
come
yes
indeed
said
flo
i
just
wanted
you
to
see
how
she
collapses
when
i
go
at
her
in
earnest
but
she
s
a
dear
old
thing
and
i
put
up
with
her
domineering
usually
because
it
s
more
peaceful
to
do
then
violet
and
lancaster
came
bringing
milly
mills
patty
greeted
the
new
girl
cordially
and
sat
down
beside
her
for
a
chat
we
re
staying
at
a
said
milly
mother
is
not
well
enough
for
the
life
in
a
hotel
i
wish
we
might
live
here
you
can
do
anything
you
like
can
t
you
why
yes
i
suppose
so
said
patty
smiling
but
i
never
think
of
it
that
way
for
i
always
like
anything
i
milly
opened
her
eyes
wide
you
do
she
said
well
i
like
anything
i
what
an
awful
way
to
live
exclaimed
patty
do
you
dislike
everything
on
principle
no
but
most
things
are
so
rome
isn
oh
yes
it
is
it
s
hot
and
dirty
and
jammed
full
of
stupid
old
milly
looked
so
utterly
disgusted
that
patty
felt
like
laughing
but
controlled
the
inclination
you
come
with
us
some
day
she
said
come
with
our
wonderers
club
and
we
ll
show
you
ruins
that
are
not
i
d
love
to
go
said
milly
i
like
you
because
you
re
so
happy
i
m
never
then
you
re
a
goose
said
patty
gaily
but
i
ll
engage
to
give
you
a
few
happy
hours
see
if
i
don
well
she
a
terror
thought
patty
as
she
turned
away
to
greet
some
others
who
were
coming
in
i
ll
have
to
study
her
out
so
far
she
s
all
fuss
and
fret
but
she
must
have
some
good
traits
how
do
you
do
leland
this
is
awfully
kind
of
you
to
come
to
my
little
tea
won
t
you
sit
here
by
miss
mills
it
was
a
mischievous
impulse
that
made
patty
put
the
distinguished
leland
to
entertain
fretful
milly
but
to
her
surprise
the
two
were
soon
chatting
pleasantly
i
thought
she
must
be
some
good
said
patty
to
herself
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
at
her
own
insight
seeing
a
green
whisk
of
femininity
among
the
bosky
glades
he
quickly
made
his
way
when
patty
heard
this
speech
in
a
monotone
she
knew
at
once
who
had
come
and
turning
with
a
glad
smile
she
held
out
both
hands
to
floyd
austin
you
dear
boy
she
cried
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
you
dear
girl
he
responded
i
m
so
glad
you
re
glad
my
word
but
we
re
gay
and
festive
aren
t
we
are
you
always
so
gorgeously
social
as
this
no
this
is
a
special
occasion
to
get
us
all
acquainted
and
afterward
we
re
to
be
just
plain
everyday
i
see
and
who
is
the
elderly
youth
talking
to
the
pretty
crosspatch
patty
fairly
giggled
at
his
quick
and
apt
descriptions
elderly
youth
is
just
the
right
term
for
leland
she
said
but
how
you
know
that
pretty
milly
mills
is
well
not
exactly
of
a
sunny
disposition
oh
i
can
tell
by
the
lines
of
her
thumbs
said
floyd
nonsensically
but
tell
me
how
does
your
own
sunny
disposition
thrive
in
rome
dost
like
the
pictures
i
do
like
the
pictures
said
patty
with
a
little
sigh
if
there
weren
t
so
many
millions
of
yes
there
are
some
few
but
then
you
need
see
only
one
at
a
but
it
s
the
same
theme
over
and
over
i
get
so
tired
of
saint
sebastian
and
his
arrows
and
susannah
and
that
everlasting
thorn
he
isn
t
a
no
it
would
be
a
pleasant
change
if
he
it
would
be
a
pleasant
change
and
a
wise
plan
too
if
they
set
the
thorn
extractors
to
picking
the
arrows
out
of
saint
indeed
it
would
and
if
they
d
tie
old
susannah
to
a
tree
she
wouldn
t
look
so
silly
as
she
usually
i
fear
your
art
instincts
are
frivolous
come
over
here
caddy
and
hear
young
america
talk
caddy
oram
who
had
come
in
with
floyd
but
had
paused
to
speak
to
nan
now
came
to
greet
patty
aren
t
you
properly
awed
by
the
art
galleries
he
asked
i
was
at
first
said
patty
truthfully
but
now
i
m
so
used
to
being
awed
that
it
doesn
t
bother
me
so
that
s
the
worst
of
it
said
caddy
one
does
get
used
to
being
awed
in
but
that
s
the
best
of
it
declared
patty
if
i
kept
on
being
as
awed
as
i
was
the
first
few
days
i
d
be
having
nervous
prostration
i
say
here
comes
old
homer
cried
floyd
as
peter
came
around
a
palm
and
joined
them
then
there
was
more
greeting
and
and
the
boys
clapped
each
other
on
the
shoulder
and
at
last
the
young
people
all
drifted
together
and
patty
thought
it
a
good
time
to
propose
that
the
newcomers
should
join
the
club
it
isn
t
a
regular
club
she
explained
because
it
has
no
regulations
we
call
it
the
i
wonder
why
put
in
austin
then
you
can
be
a
member
returned
patty
promptly
you
ve
qualified
i
ll
be
a
member
too
said
caddy
oram
i
m
the
best
wonderer
you
ever
saw
i
can
wonder
at
well
you
re
all
members
said
patty
and
you
can
go
on
the
when
you
like
and
stay
home
when
you
like
now
morning
the
club
is
going
to
peter
s
and
if
there
s
time
we
may
wander
into
the
vatican
to
be
sure
peter
s
is
flubdubby
but
what
interrupted
peter
homer
in
amazement
patty
dimpled
roguishly
yes
she
went
on
as
architecture
the
interior
is
pure
at
this
homer
went
off
in
peals
of
laughter
and
leland
who
was
conversing
with
fairfield
overheard
and
gave
an
appreciative
nod
at
patty
you
re
right
peter
said
at
last
quite
right
but
how
did
you
know
it
oh
said
patty
laughing
i
m
a
born
you
must
be
said
peter
still
smiling
flubdub
indeed
now
to
proceed
with
our
plans
said
patty
all
who
will
go
wondering
with
us
morning
open
your
mouth
wide
and
say
ah
which
is
our
club
loud
ahs
came
from
every
throat
and
the
trip
was
decided
upon
i
m
president
of
the
club
went
on
patty
and
homer
is
guide
philosopher
and
friend
the
rest
of
you
can
be
any
officers
you
choose
it
s
nicer
to
elect
ourselves
than
each
so
it
is
agreed
floyd
austin
i
ll
be
that
s
an
easy
office
observed
patty
as
we
have
no
dues
of
any
sort
homer
just
pays
for
everything
and
then
afterward
we
pay
him
simple
methods
the
best
agreed
austin
still
i
ll
be
treasurer
and
then
if
any
money
matters
do
happen
i
can
look
after
i
shan
t
seek
any
office
said
cadwalader
oram
i
ll
let
it
seek
me
probably
one
will
hunt
me
up
in
a
day
or
i
m
sure
of
it
said
patty
you
re
more
apt
to
find
your
right
niche
that
you
talk
as
if
i
were
a
statue
perhaps
i
ll
find
my
niche
waiting
for
me
in
the
well
don
t
be
a
thorn
extractor
said
patty
or
i
won
t
even
look
you
up
in
the
catalogue
what
will
you
be
milly
i
ll
be
another
president
said
milly
unexpectedly
i
can
t
bear
to
play
second
good
said
patty
let
s
all
us
girls
be
presidents
and
then
the
boys
can
be
all
the
other
so
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
all
meet
next
morning
at
nine
o
clock
for
a
visit
to
peter
s
unless
we
start
early
said
patty
we
ll
never
get
how
bright
of
you
to
see
that
said
lancaster
admiringly
and
i
say
everybody
must
bring
i
can
t
i
m
saving
mine
said
floyd
austin
saving
them
what
for
asked
violet
to
make
a
bed
quilt
he
replied
gravely
they
make
a
lovely
one
you
tie
them
together
at
the
corners
you
know
with
bits
of
tiny
what
a
goose
you
are
said
patty
laughing
you
re
just
foolish
enough
for
our
club
save
your
postcards
then
you
can
look
over
and
mine
said
flo
i
ve
a
bigger
pack
even
than
i
ve
something
better
than
postcards
said
floyd
as
he
produced
a
small
thin
red
book
have
any
of
you
seen
this
none
of
them
had
so
floyd
explained
it
s
a
little
panorama
sort
of
thing
he
said
as
he
exhibited
its
pages
with
pictures
of
all
the
roman
places
of
interest
but
the
beautiful
part
of
it
is
the
description
of
each
sight
it
is
evidently
written
by
an
italian
whose
linguistic
lore
is
limited
you
see
on
each
page
is
an
english
paragraph
and
also
the
same
information
in
german
french
and
italian
listen
i
ll
read
you
the
note
about
the
piazza
of
peter
s
this
majestic
place
of
elliptical
form
with
the
vast
front
of
the
cathedral
and
the
imposing
cupola
masterpiece
of
michelangelo
that
it
appears
to
elevate
itself
to
the
heaven
forms
with
the
two
round
porticos
in
four
rows
of
columns
all
what
here
is
of
more
sumptuous
for
enjoying
the
most
fine
panorama
it
must
go
until
to
the
cupola
of
peter
by
the
summit
of
this
monument
the
town
is
extending
under
our
eyes
with
all
its
remarkable
buildings
not
so
far
there
is
the
tiber
this
historical
river
on
dragging
along
slowly
its
waters
divides
the
city
into
two
unequal
parts
in
front
by
a
side
we
see
the
alban
mountains
of
tivoli
of
the
sabine
and
by
the
other
the
sea
that
with
its
sweetness
seems
that
our
weakened
eyes
are
reposing
for
the
view
of
so
much
oh
i
say
floyd
broke
in
peter
homer
are
you
reading
that
as
it
is
yes
truly
said
austin
isn
t
it
great
just
listen
to
this
on
the
right
of
the
majestic
place
is
elevated
the
vatican
that
is
a
whole
of
palaces
containing
all
what
can
be
of
more
rich
in
the
it
s
perfectly
delicious
said
patty
as
soon
as
she
could
for
laughing
i
must
have
one
of
those
i
ll
give
each
of
the
club
members
one
said
floyd
they
re
cheap
little
affairs
the
postcard
men
sell
them
but
the
pictures
are
really
good
and
you
never
heard
anything
so
funny
as
the
indeed
they
are
funny
agreed
peter
we
ll
each
carry
a
copy
wherever
we
go
read
us
a
little
but
just
then
tea
was
served
and
the
young
people
turned
their
attention
to
that
interesting
episode
floyd
austin
sauntered
over
and
took
a
seat
beside
milly
mills
delightful
music
isn
t
it
he
said
with
intent
of
opening
a
conversation
and
as
the
orchestra
was
really
a
fine
one
he
expected
the
girl
to
agree
i
hate
music
while
i
m
eating
was
the
surprising
response
and
floyd
looked
at
the
girl
to
see
if
she
were
jesting
but
milly
s
discontented
face
showed
that
her
remark
however
and
was
sincerely
meant
do
you
now
said
floyd
what
a
pity
you
must
be
bothered
to
death
oh
i
don
t
live
here
i
wish
i
did
i
live
in
a
most
uninteresting
place
isn
t
miss
fairfield
lovely
she
certainly
is
said
floyd
looking
at
laughing
patty
as
a
pleasant
contrast
to
this
pouting
girl
she
s
so
sunny
and
yes
she
must
have
everything
she
do
you
know
i
think
she
d
be
sunny
if
she
didn
t
have
everything
she
well
then
it
s
because
she
happens
to
be
of
that
disposition
and
milly
sighed
as
if
that
settled
the
matter
as
floyd
didn
t
consider
it
his
place
to
lecture
a
comparative
stranger
on
the
ethics
of
contentment
he
changed
the
subject
and
talked
of
lighter
matters
and
so
infectious
was
his
own
merry
disposition
that
he
made
milly
forget
her
discontent
and
smile
so
gaily
that
she
was
really
charming
chapter
x
the
wonderers
it
was
simply
pouring
sunlight
when
the
wonderers
set
off
next
morning
they
started
early
for
as
they
all
agreed
luncheon
time
in
rome
comes
sooner
than
anywhere
else
they
went
in
a
large
omnibus
sort
of
affair
which
held
them
all
snippy
accompanied
them
for
the
simple
reason
that
she
wouldn
t
remain
behind
but
as
she
was
a
most
amiable
person
except
when
reprimanding
her
young
charge
nobody
objected
to
her
presence
milly
mills
was
the
only
unwelcome
member
of
the
party
it
did
seem
as
if
that
girl
was
never
in
a
good
humour
if
it
looked
cloudy
she
feared
rain
if
the
sun
shone
it
hurt
her
eyes
the
omnibus
was
too
jolty
too
too
nothing
pleased
her
and
she
pleased
nobody
but
patty
felt
sorry
for
the
girl
for
she
really
had
no
one
to
take
her
about
so
it
was
decided
that
she
was
to
go
with
the
wonderers
whenever
she
chose
the
young
men
politely
tried
to
entertain
her
but
she
met
their
advances
with
a
cold
negligence
or
a
sharp
retort
and
thus
discouraged
their
efforts
but
the
irrepressible
gaiety
of
the
others
could
not
be
seriously
impaired
by
one
unhappy
nature
so
the
fun
and
chatter
went
gaily
on
as
the
old
vehicle
lumbered
along
of
course
said
lancaster
if
this
chariot
follow
the
example
of
the
shay
and
go
to
pieces
all
at
once
i
suppose
we
could
walk
the
rest
of
the
the
rest
of
the
way
to
where
asked
his
sister
why
to
wherever
we
re
going
where
we
going
anyway
we
re
going
to
peter
s
said
patty
firmly
i
m
president
and
that
s
my
presidents
don
t
make
decrees
said
flo
you
sound
more
like
a
roman
emperor
but
i
d
as
lieve
go
to
peter
s
as
you
re
a
careless
lot
said
peter
homer
now
i
ll
be
the
of
this
expedition
and
we
ll
go
first
to
the
church
of
the
for
said
milly
mills
so
suddenly
that
patty
fairly
jumped
milly
had
a
queer
little
habit
of
saying
what
for
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
what
and
the
aggressive
way
in
which
she
fairly
exploded
the
words
always
annoyed
patty
but
homer
answered
milly
very
gently
and
said
to
see
some
mural
decorations
that
i
m
sure
you
will
enjoy
for
their
oddity
and
strange
i
hate
mural
paintings
said
milly
in
a
resigned
tone
as
if
her
wishes
made
little
difference
as
indeed
was
the
case
but
these
aren
t
oh
stucco
i
suppose
well
that
s
but
these
aren
t
stucco
said
peter
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
at
milly
s
unreasonable
crossness
no
they
re
stuck
on
said
floyd
austin
and
peter
added
yes
sort
of
appliqué
what
are
they
asked
patty
her
interest
aroused
by
the
smile
in
peter
s
eyes
wait
till
you
get
there
and
you
ll
if
we
ever
get
there
alive
said
lank
as
the
stage
rumbled
over
a
bit
of
bad
road
and
swayed
sideways
is
there
danger
cried
milly
in
dismay
there
s
always
danger
in
rome
returned
peter
i
say
broke
in
floyd
do
you
remember
any
of
you
rollo
s
very
excellent
rule
about
dangers
no
said
patty
what
was
it
i
don
t
remember
myself
but
when
i
was
a
little
chap
i
used
to
love
rollo
in
rome
and
one
of
those
page
headings
was
just
those
words
rollo
s
excellent
rule
about
now
if
we
only
remembered
it
we
could
put
it
to
i
know
it
said
milly
smiling
for
the
first
time
that
morning
you
do
good
the
country
is
safe
tell
it
to
why
you
know
that
funny
george
was
going
about
with
rollo
and
he
told
him
not
to
go
too
near
the
edge
of
some
place
so
rollo
said
you
may
go
as
near
as
you
think
safe
george
and
i
will
keep
back
an
inch
from
where
you
very
well
said
right
you
are
said
floyd
that
s
it
but
i
suppose
it
doesn
t
apply
to
this
case
exactly
however
it
s
splendid
to
remember
if
we
re
in
the
right
sort
of
danger
at
any
time
don
t
you
just
love
rollo
anyway
yes
indeed
said
milly
brightening
and
george
too
he
was
so
indulgent
he
always
said
very
well
no
matter
what
rollo
wanted
to
i
m
not
like
that
declared
peter
homer
i
expect
you
all
to
say
very
well
to
whatever
i
want
to
do
so
first
we
ll
go
in
here
to
the
capuchin
church
alight
their
lumbering
vehicle
stopped
and
they
all
went
into
the
old
church
its
unadorned
and
unattractive
exterior
made
patty
wonder
why
they
came
there
and
the
interior
was
not
much
more
interesting
homer
made
his
little
band
of
wonderers
pause
while
a
monk
drew
aside
a
curtain
and
revealed
guido
reni
s
famous
painting
of
st
michael
and
the
they
all
enjoyed
the
short
description
homer
gave
them
of
this
picture
and
then
they
went
on
through
the
small
side
chapels
and
downstairs
to
see
the
decorated
walls
of
which
peter
had
spoken
when
patty
saw
what
the
decorations
were
composed
of
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
room
after
room
they
went
through
and
on
each
wall
and
ceiling
were
elaborate
and
intricate
patterns
worked
out
in
human
bones
the
party
was
conducted
by
a
capuchin
monk
who
walked
ahead
and
pointed
out
the
curious
details
the
monk
wore
a
long
brown
robe
with
a
cowl
and
a
rope
about
his
waist
patty
thought
he
looked
sad
and
she
said
so
to
homer
monks
always
look
sad
he
replied
it
s
part
of
their
as
the
monk
could
speak
no
english
he
told
them
about
the
bones
in
italian
and
peter
homer
translated
for
the
benefit
of
the
others
he
says
said
peter
that
all
these
decorations
you
see
on
walls
and
ceilings
are
the
bones
of
four
thousand
monks
who
have
in
the
past
belonged
to
this
monastery
the
designs
are
called
mosaics
but
properly
they
are
appliquéd
the
wonderers
gazed
in
real
wonder
at
the
strange
effects
just
such
designs
as
would
be
used
to
adorn
a
painted
or
gilded
salon
were
here
carried
out
in
bones
long
arm
or
leg
bones
radiating
from
a
centre
formed
a
conventional
star
rosettes
were
made
of
rings
of
overlapping
and
delicate
traceries
were
woven
of
ribs
and
smaller
bones
or
there
would
be
a
frieze
of
skulls
interspersed
with
geometrical
figures
made
with
hundreds
of
finger
joints
and
here
and
there
in
a
niche
was
a
complete
skeleton
in
a
mouldering
robe
so
old
that
it
scarce
hung
together
sometimes
these
skeleton
monks
reclined
in
a
recess
lined
with
skulls
and
bones
it
was
all
most
curious
and
though
somewhat
gruesome
patty
was
fascinated
at
the
strange
sight
ask
him
if
he
likes
it
she
said
to
peter
and
when
asked
he
answered
at
great
length
and
very
earnestly
what
does
he
say
asked
patty
impatiently
he
declares
said
peter
that
to
be
used
in
this
decorative
way
is
the
greatest
honour
a
capuchin
monk
can
have
to
gain
it
a
monk
must
have
been
in
the
monastery
for
years
and
he
s
awfully
afraid
he
ll
die
before
he
earns
his
right
to
be
a
ugh
said
milly
with
a
shiver
i
hate
it
let
s
go
out
into
the
so
milly
and
violet
with
one
or
two
of
the
others
went
on
out
of
the
crypts
but
patty
lingered
to
see
a
little
more
of
the
strange
cemetery
i
suppose
the
whole
gentlemen
are
more
honoured
than
the
dissected
ones
she
said
yes
said
floyd
and
they
seem
all
broken
up
about
it
don
t
jest
said
patty
i
think
it
s
very
impressive
and
interesting
oh
look
at
that
lamp
a
hanging
lamp
swung
from
the
ceiling
and
the
bowl
of
it
was
made
of
skulls
surrounded
by
vertebræ
while
the
suspension
was
made
of
many
femurs
fastened
end
to
end
i
simply
must
have
postcards
of
these
said
flo
and
they
asked
the
grave
monk
if
they
might
buy
them
apparently
he
had
never
heard
of
postcards
for
peter
could
not
make
him
understand
at
last
he
offered
them
photographs
and
they
all
bought
some
afterward
they
did
find
some
postcards
but
it
was
at
an
outside
shop
and
the
monk
who
never
went
outside
his
restricted
limits
knew
nothing
of
them
that
s
the
most
wonderful
thing
i
ve
seen
yet
said
patty
as
they
returned
to
their
lumbering
old
carryall
i
think
it
s
terrible
said
milly
don
t
let
s
talk
about
it
so
out
of
deference
to
their
somewhat
difficult
member
they
dropped
the
subject
but
patty
never
forgot
the
capuchin
monks
who
approve
of
such
a
strange
way
of
venerating
their
dead
to
peter
s
they
went
next
homer
hustled
them
all
out
of
the
stage
before
they
entered
the
piazza
saying
they
must
fasten
a
picture
of
it
in
their
memory
you
can
t
see
the
best
view
of
the
church
if
you
re
close
to
it
he
said
stand
here
and
he
paused
before
they
entered
the
great
colonnaded
circle
and
there
he
made
them
stand
for
fully
five
minutes
without
speaking
while
they
photographed
the
scene
on
their
mind
isn
t
he
great
whispered
patty
to
flo
as
they
were
released
and
allowed
to
go
forward
yes
indeed
i
never
saw
anyone
who
knows
so
well
how
to
make
instructive
without
being
a
inside
the
church
said
peter
as
they
were
about
to
enter
you
may
wander
and
wonder
as
you
please
i
ve
no
word
to
say
for
it
s
too
big
to
talk
about
as
a
whole
and
we
haven
t
time
now
to
discuss
its
parts
so
look
about
you
as
you
like
and
crane
your
necks
up
at
the
dome
or
admire
the
frantic
allegories
on
the
walls
as
you
i
want
to
see
peter
s
statue
said
patty
but
i
don
t
want
to
kiss
his
here
it
is
said
homer
leading
her
to
the
great
bronze
statue
as
they
looked
at
it
many
visitors
approached
and
kissed
the
bronze
toe
which
owing
to
the
height
of
the
pedestal
is
just
about
at
the
level
of
a
person
s
head
invariably
the
devotee
wiped
off
the
toe
with
his
handkerchief
before
setting
his
lips
to
the
sacred
shrine
and
patty
was
amazed
to
find
on
a
closer
inspection
that
the
great
bronze
toe
was
nearly
all
worn
away
but
it
isn
t
worn
by
the
kisses
said
patty
it
s
worn
by
the
handkerchiefs
that
s
true
said
peter
and
it
s
a
good
plan
to
use
a
handkerchief
but
i
think
it
s
a
better
plan
to
omit
the
osculation
so
do
i
agreed
patty
but
what
a
lot
of
people
have
dabbed
at
it
to
wear
away
that
solid
bronze
they
have
indeed
now
i
ll
show
you
some
of
the
other
they
paused
before
several
of
the
best
sculptures
and
homer
told
their
history
in
a
short
simple
way
patty
enjoyed
it
all
and
even
milly
seemed
to
be
interested
the
others
staid
to
listen
or
drifted
away
and
came
wandering
back
as
the
fancy
took
them
perhaps
snippy
appreciated
homer
s
talk
more
than
any
of
the
others
for
she
was
well
versed
in
artistic
lore
but
she
remained
quietly
in
the
background
and
let
the
young
people
chatter
by
themselves
as
they
left
the
church
they
found
it
had
turned
cloudy
and
the
sky
showed
decided
appearance
of
almost
immediate
rain
just
the
thing
cried
homer
i
ve
been
waiting
for
a
good
shower
jump
into
the
they
scrambled
in
thinking
they
were
about
to
return
to
the
hotel
but
peter
told
the
driver
to
go
to
the
pantheon
why
it
s
going
to
rain
said
patty
i
know
it
that
s
why
we
re
going
to
the
pantheon
its
roof
what
you
talking
about
just
what
i
say
have
you
been
to
the
pantheon
no
not
yet
why
well
as
you
perhaps
know
it
s
open
at
the
top
there
s
a
hole
feet
across
and
as
the
pantheon
has
no
umbrella
it
rains
milly
was
laughing
to
herself
at
this
conversation
what
are
you
giggling
at
said
patty
a
bit
surprised
to
see
milly
amused
why
said
milly
that
s
exactly
what
rollo
did
as
soon
as
it
began
to
rain
he
flew
to
the
pantheon
to
see
it
rain
in
i
didn
t
know
that
said
peter
smiling
i
fear
i
am
sadly
deficient
in
my
rollo
but
it
is
really
a
good
plan
to
fly
to
the
pantheon
when
it
rains
for
it
s
not
always
easy
to
get
such
an
after
they
reached
the
pantheon
and
were
inside
patty
understood
why
it
was
a
desirable
thing
to
do
it
was
a
sudden
and
very
hard
shower
and
the
strange
effect
of
the
rain
coming
in
at
the
open
skylight
was
curious
indeed
the
only
opening
in
the
pantheon
save
the
entrance
door
is
the
large
round
hole
at
the
top
of
its
domed
roof
this
is
open
to
the
sky
and
sunlight
and
rain
alike
come
in
many
people
stood
round
the
edges
of
the
circular
church
but
the
centre
of
the
floor
was
wet
with
the
driving
rain
so
swift
were
the
drops
that
they
spattered
up
again
as
they
struck
the
stone
floor
and
it
was
like
hundreds
of
tiny
fountains
but
save
for
the
wet
circle
on
the
floor
the
place
was
dry
and
pleasant
they
looked
at
the
various
tombs
and
monuments
and
then
inscribed
their
names
in
the
book
which
is
there
for
that
purpose
it
s
wonderful
said
patty
gazing
reverently
around
the
great
room
as
they
were
leaving
but
i
should
think
they
would
have
a
canopy
of
some
sort
over
that
hole
in
the
they
did
said
peter
but
the
shutter
or
whatever
it
was
is
lost
and
has
never
been
why
not
i
wonder
said
patty
i
wonder
said
peter
it
was
their
good
fortune
that
the
shower
was
but
a
short
one
and
when
they
reached
the
street
again
the
rain
had
stopped
and
soon
after
the
sun
shone
once
more
i
m
glad
we
had
that
opportunity
said
patty
for
it
almost
never
rains
in
rome
and
i
shall
always
remember
that
circular
now
said
flo
mayn
t
we
go
to
a
shop
before
we
go
home
for
said
milly
trinkets
replied
flo
i
m
making
a
memory
a
what
said
patty
eagerly
for
it
sounded
attractive
why
you
get
a
chain
explained
flo
a
slender
silver
one
you
know
and
then
you
get
all
sorts
of
little
jigs
to
hang
on
jigs
yes
little
carved
ivory
elephants
and
monkeys
little
silver
things
of
all
sorts
or
bronze
or
wood
or
anything
come
on
into
a
shop
and
i
ll
show
you
homer
you
must
know
the
right
kind
of
shop
don
t
you
i
think
so
he
said
but
miss
mills
where
did
rollo
go
for
this
purpose
i
don
t
think
he
made
a
memory
chain
said
milly
pleased
to
be
consulted
but
the
description
of
his
shopping
for
a
roman
sash
is
very
patty
secretly
wondered
if
milly
had
ever
read
any
other
book
beside
rollo
but
she
realised
that
she
didn
t
yet
know
the
girl
and
indeed
she
wasn
t
easy
to
get
acquainted
with
peter
took
them
to
a
fascinating
little
shop
where
there
were
all
sorts
of
tiny
wares
at
prices
not
exorbitant
and
the
girls
all
bought
trinkets
for
memory
chains
don
t
get
too
many
at
once
said
flo
to
patty
you
know
you
must
buy
some
in
florence
or
venice
or
wherever
you
go
get
something
appropriate
to
the
city
if
you
patty
bought
a
little
silver
cat
for
she
said
she
remembered
seeing
cats
all
over
the
forum
and
coliseum
and
especially
in
trajan
s
forum
then
she
bought
a
tiny
column
and
a
little
model
of
the
arch
of
constantine
and
several
others
the
men
didn
t
seem
to
want
memory
chains
but
they
each
bought
a
tiny
trinket
to
carry
as
a
as
a
memento
of
the
wonderers
club
chapter
xi
roman
punch
it
was
a
very
rainy
day
so
the
excursion
which
the
wonderers
had
planned
had
to
be
postponed
and
so
they
were
gathered
in
the
fairfields
pleasant
trying
to
make
believe
they
didn
t
care
to
go
out
in
this
attempt
they
all
succeeded
better
than
milly
who
was
distinctly
and
aggressively
cross
milly
said
peter
homer
in
his
kind
way
after
one
of
her
petulant
outbursts
it
s
raining
and
i
m
glad
it
is
and
you
re
going
to
be
glad
too
you
re
going
to
have
such
a
good
time
this
afternoon
that
you
ll
go
home
saying
you
re
glad
it
rained
so
we
couldn
t
go
driving
out
the
appian
i
won
t
do
any
such
thing
declared
milly
how
could
i
like
it
better
to
sit
cooped
up
in
a
stuffy
old
parlour
than
to
go
for
a
lovely
drive
wait
and
see
my
child
said
peter
now
my
wonder
friends
i
ll
tell
you
my
plan
let
s
start
a
paper
a
nice
little
paper
and

it
every
week
cried
patty
who
loved
to
write
things
yes
for
one
consecutive
week
anyway
i
ll
be
and
you
can
all
be
department
editors
and
choose
any
department
you
like
if
i
were
to
suggest
i
d
say
let
patty
fairfield
be
the
fashion
editor
for
she
always
wears
such
masterpieces
of
sartorial
they
all
laughed
at
peter
s
description
of
patty
s
pretty
frocks
and
she
said
well
i
m
glad
you
didn
t
call
my
clothes
flubdubby
anyhow
yes
i
ll
write
your
fashion
column
what
will
you
write
milly
i
don
t
know
yet
but
i
ll
write
something
shall
we
do
it
now
the
girl
s
face
had
brightened
wonderfully
peter
had
discovered
that
she
had
secret
leanings
toward
literature
and
he
felt
sure
that
his
plan
for
the
afternoon
s
amusement
would
appeal
to
her
yes
we
ll
begin
at
once
he
said
if
patty
can
provide
paper
and
pencils
you
may
each
have
a
half
hour
and
then
must
turn
in
your
copy
finished
or
patty
found
plenty
of
stationery
and
went
about
distributing
it
to
her
guests
i
can
t
write
a
thing
declared
flo
but
i
ll
draw
a
picture
is
it
to
be
an
illustrated
paper
it
will
be
said
peter
if
illustrations
are
i
ll
do
a
limerick
said
caddy
oram
i
just
love
to
do
let
s
having
missing
line
ones
said
violet
all
right
you
do
that
kind
then
everybody
can
do
just
what
he
or
she
we
must
have
the
paper
uniform
said
patty
so
we
can
bind
it
all
together
yes
said
lank
van
winkle
then
we
ll
have
typewritten
copies
made
for
each
of
if
we
want
them
put
in
floyd
i
m
not
sure
this
crowd
can
write
a
volume
worthy
of
undying
traitor
put
him
out
cried
lank
if
he
s
so
i
ll
write
his
you
mean
said
peter
no
everyone
must
write
his
own
now
what
shall
we
choose
as
a
title
for
our
paper
is
it
to
be
a
humorous
publication
asked
floyd
yes
then
listen
lend
me
your
ears
and
prepare
to
receive
my
suggestion
with
thunders
of
applause
for
i
am
about
to
offer
you
the
best
and
indeed
the
only
title
for
the
huh
said
lank
if
it
s
the
only
one
you
deserve
little
credit
for
thinking
of
wait
till
you
hear
it
said
floyd
undismayed
if
you
don
t
applaud
i
ll
know
you
don
t
appreciate
true
cleverness
i
propose
ladies
and
gentlemen
that
we
call
our
weekly
paper
the
he
was
indeed
greeted
with
applause
and
every
one
agreed
that
his
suggestion
was
the
very
thing
then
you
see
he
went
on
we
can
model
it
after
the
london
only
it
will
be
then
they
all
set
to
work
and
as
no
pretensions
to
real
literary
excellence
were
expected
they
rapidly
scribbled
a
lot
of
nonsense
floyd
finished
first
and
began
bothering
the
others
i
ll
help
you
patty
he
said
sitting
down
beside
her
no
don
t
speak
to
me
the
depth
of
my
subject
requires
concentration
of
thought
you
go
so
floyd
wandered
over
to
flo
s
side
and
criticised
her
drawing
ho
ho
if
i
couldn
t
draw
better
than
that
here
let
me
take
your
but
flo
only
gave
him
a
terrible
frown
and
he
backed
away
cowering
in
pretended
terror
but
at
last
the
half
hour
was
up
and
peter
announced
that
the
manuscripts
must
be
handed
in
whether
finished
or
not
what
luck
cried
caddy
oram
who
had
been
working
diligently
i
ve
just
four
lines
of
my
limerick
done
so
we
can
make
a
missing
line
contest
of
let
s
call
in
father
and
nan
to
hear
the
reading
said
patty
and
flo
why
don
t
you
invite
snippy
if
she
d
like
to
come
oh
she
ll
adore
to
come
said
flo
and
ran
in
search
of
her
governess
so
the
audience
was
increased
by
three
and
then
all
sat
in
readiness
to
hear
the
paper
read
peter
and
floyd
had
arranged
the
pages
and
had
added
a
sort
of
introduction
and
by
unanimous
invitation
peter
was
induced
to
read
it
so
in
his
pleasant
deep
voice
he
read
the
a
journal
written
by
members
of
the
wonderers
club
during
their
roam
in
rome
there
may
be
further
numbers
and
there
may
not
subscription
limited
the
first
selection
is
an
exquisite
poem
by
our
popular
poet
floyd
austin
you
will
notice
the
marvellous
dexterity
of
his
rhyming
as
well
as
the
delicate
beauty
of
his
imagination
it
is
called
a
rhyme
of
a
roman
an
old
roman
known
to
no
man
without
friend
and
without
foeman
without
title
or
cognomen
is
the
subject
of
my
pome
and
the
roman
never
homin
still
is
roamin
still
is
roamin
in
the
dawn
or
in
the
gloamin
see
him
roam
and
roam
and
roam
all
about
the
streets
of
this
effusion
received
great
applause
until
the
modest
poet
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
quite
overcome
at
the
ovation
there
s
something
so
tragic
about
it
that
it
makes
me
weep
said
nan
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
it
s
the
noble
numbers
that
affect
you
my
dear
said
her
husband
grandeur
of
thought
is
always
floyd
s
contribution
made
a
great
hit
and
then
peter
went
on
to
read
another
the
next
is
a
fine
limerick
by
miss
violet
van
winkle
it
throws
light
on
a
hitherto
mysterious
subject
and
it
justifies
what
has
often
been
considered
a
cruel
deed
of
a
bloodthirsty
emperor
i
refer
to
the
late
nero
and
his
burning
of
his
native
town
the
true
facts
of
the
case
are
here
set
forth
well
yes
said
tiberius
nero
i
frankly
admit
i
m
a
hero
but
it
wasn
t
for
ire
that
i
set
rome
afire
the
weather
was
quite
down
to
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
floyd
said
slowly
oh
i
see
he
kindled
the
fire
to
warm
himself
yes
said
violet
it
was
a
cold
winter
that
twas
a
chilly
day
for
nero
when
the
mercury
went
to
zero
said
caddy
but
i
say
was
nero
s
name
tiberius
too
no
said
violet
unabashed
but
it
needed
that
to
fill
up
the
line
nicely
and
anyway
it
may
have
been
those
old
romans
had
lots
of
names
besides
the
ones
they
used
every
of
course
they
did
said
patty
and
i
m
sure
he
was
tiberius
nero
it
sounds
so
natural
that
next
we
come
to
a
picture
went
on
peter
this
gem
of
art
is
the
work
of
our
talented
wonderer
miss
flo
carrington
i
will
hold
it
up
that
you
may
see
it
but
as
its
merit
can
only
be
appreciated
by
a
closer
inspection
we
will
pass
it
around
the
circle
it
represents
miss
fairfield
hugging
her
very
dear
friend
the
flo
s
picture
was
really
clever
though
only
a
slight
sketch
it
showed
a
very
good
caricatured
likeness
of
patty
her
arms
abnormally
long
were
embracing
the
coliseum
which
with
a
happy
smile
was
enjoying
the
occasion
patty
declared
she
should
keep
the
picture
and
have
it
framed
and
homer
said
she
might
do
so
after
he
had
photographic
prints
made
of
it
for
them
all
the
next
continued
peter
is
a
poem
by
our
talented
member
miss
milly
mills
this
is
a
most
creditable
composition
and
quite
appropriate
to
our
paper
i
think
to
do
it
full
justice
it
should
be
read
by
its
author
miss
mills
won
t
you
read
your
verses
yourself
flattered
by
peter
s
kind
words
milly
took
the
paper
and
read
her
own
lines
aloud
it
was
a
really
good
humorous
jingle
and
as
milly
read
it
each
of
the
others
felt
surprise
that
she
could
do
such
clever
work
a
roman
coin
there
once
was
a
queer
roman
boy
though
equally
queer
he
would
deem
us
a
nice
child
was
he
born
and
named
regulus
romulus
remus
his
queer
and
ridiculous
garb
was
roman
from
toga
to
sandal
he
ate
for
his
lunch
some
cold
roman
punch
by
the
light
of
a
large
roman
candle
one
day
he
had
finished
his
meal
and
went
for
a
walk
in
the
forum
he
made
beneath
the
big
arches
with
banners
and
flags
floating
o
er
em
when
he
found
lying
right
in
his
path
a
roman
coin
called
a
denarius
dated
he
exclaimed
goodness
me
that
s
the
year
i
was
born
how
hilarious
i
m
sure
it
will
bring
me
good
luck
this
coin
with
its
date
and
so
he
went
roamin
about
in
the
gloamin
with
his
roman
nose
held
high
and
haughty
but
stay
there
s
a
flaw
in
this
tale
a
coin
of
that
date
is
peculiar
i
don
t
think
you
ll
see
em
in
any
museum
i
just
told
about
it
to
fool
yer
why
milly
cried
patty
in
delight
i
think
that
s
fine
i
d
no
idea
you
were
such
a
that
isn
t
poetry
said
milly
it
s
just
and
mighty
good
jingle
said
nan
but
why
was
the
coin
peculiar
didn
t
they
have
coins
in
oh
nan
said
fairfield
stop
and
think
how
could
a
coin
be
i
don
t
see
why
not
doesn
t
that
mean
forty
years
before
christ
yes
but
is
only
used
since
oh
of
course
i
see
they
didn
t
use
until
the
time
meant
by
had
gone
by
exactly
that
said
fairfield
but
milly
that
s
a
little
jingle
and
i
think
you
re
in
a
fair
way
to
become
a
milly
blushed
with
pleasure
at
the
compliment
and
her
face
lost
entirely
its
usual
discontented
expression
so
that
s
her
ambition
thought
patty
to
herself
i
ll
have
a
good
talk
with
her
about
it
when
i
get
a
chance
perhaps
i
can
help
it
was
the
delight
of
patty
s
life
to
help
anybody
and
she
felt
sure
she
could
aid
milly
if
only
by
sympathetic
interest
in
her
literary
products
now
went
on
peter
we
ll
listen
to
some
very
wise
wisdom
from
the
pen
of
our
young
american
philosopher
lancaster
van
winkle
he
has
chosen
to
favour
us
with
a
collection
of
proverbs
i
will
read
them
for
i
know
his
natural
modesty
will
make
him
too
embarrassed
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
the
first
gem
of
priceless
wit
is
this
rome
is
where
the
art
at
this
punning
a
general
groan
was
heard
from
the
audience
cheer
up
said
peter
worse
is
yet
to
a
roman
stone
gathers
no
i
don
t
see
any
sense
to
that
remarked
flo
there
isn
t
any
said
lank
amiably
but
it
somehow
sounded
as
if
there
ought
to
it
sound
so
said
patty
encouragingly
go
on
the
coliseum
is
the
thief
of
that
s
a
good
one
what
next
where
ignorance
is
bliss
tis
folly
to
study
guidebooks
one
touch
of
baedeker
makes
the
whole
world
kin
tourists
will
happen
in
the
best
regulated
ruins
he
who
romes
and
roams
away
may
live
to
rome
another
i
think
they
re
great
said
floyd
i
want
a
copy
of
thank
you
said
lank
with
a
bow
to
his
admirer
now
said
peter
we
come
to
a
column
of
fashion
notes
by
our
esteemed
friend
miss
fairfield
who
is
an
authority
on
the
subject
i
will
read
it
to
you
fall
fashions
for
rome
this
season
cabmen
will
continue
to
wear
the
tattered
and
disreputable
costumes
which
they
have
apparently
worn
for
the
last
decade
tourists
will
wear
short
skirts
and
a
look
of
inquiry
roman
citizens
have
discarded
togas
and
tunics
and
now
wear
any
old
thing
their
appearance
is
not
so
picturesque
as
formerly
americans
and
britishers
visiting
in
rome
will
wear
roman
sashes
a
great
deal
this
fall
as
they
think
it
gives
them
a
touch
of
local
colour
they
will
also
wear
memory
chains
visitors
who
have
already
been
to
naples
are
wearing
pink
coral
necklaces
there
is
little
change
in
the
fashions
for
statues
as
a
rule
these
people
seem
not
to
care
much
for
clothing
and
what
they
wear
is
scanty
of
material
and
shows
little
if
any
trimming
the
statues
are
not
wearing
hats
this
year
and
their
styles
of
though
picturesque
are
a
bit
good
for
you
patty
cried
her
father
that
s
good
fooling
my
child
you
may
turn
out
a
i
don
t
think
so
said
patty
doubtfully
i
had
pretty
hard
work
to
grind
that
out
i
m
glad
you
like
it
s
very
waggish
said
snippy
in
such
a
tone
that
the
others
had
to
laugh
now
that
s
real
praise
snippy
said
peter
homer
as
flo
s
governess
objected
to
her
own
name
and
preferred
the
funny
title
flo
had
given
her
long
ago
the
other
young
people
compromised
by
prefixing
a
which
seemed
at
least
a
little
more
respectful
they
had
all
grown
to
like
the
and
dictatorial
old
lady
and
her
approval
of
the
fun
of
the
pleased
them
now
said
peter
we
come
to
the
last
contribution
it
is
the
work
of
the
distinguished
englishman
cadwalader
oram
better
known
as
caddy
indeed
he
s
so
fond
of
afternoon
tea
i
might
call
him
well
as
he
hadn
t
quite
finished
his
immortal
limerick
verse
when
the
bell
rang
we
ll
call
it
a
contest
and
we
ll
all
have
a
try
at
it
have
you
a
prize
patty
that
can
be
given
to
the
successful
one
that
s
the
beauty
of
rome
said
patty
you
do
nothing
but
collect
articles
that
are
just
right
for
prizes
i
ll
have
enough
to
last
me
all
the
winter
for
and
such
things
at
home
here
i
ll
give
you
this
little
model
of
the
temple
of
saturn
in
parian
pooh
we
ve
all
got
those
already
said
violet
and
anyway
they
break
if
you
look
at
you
must
give
softer
glances
then
said
austin
but
patty
something
a
little
less
ubiquitous
would
suit
me
better
well
here
s
a
little
silver
statuette
of
peter
said
patty
how
s
that
a
whole
lot
better
i
ll
try
hard
to
win
but
i
don
t
understand
the
contest
part
said
patty
what
do
we
do
why
caddy
has
written
four
lines
of
a
limerick
explained
peter
i
ll
read
those
you
may
jot
them
down
if
you
like
then
each
tries
to
write
a
fifth
line
and
whichever
is
judged
the
best
gets
the
who
s
the
judge
well
i
ll
appoint
fairfield
and
snippy
to
judge
the
efforts
now
listen
here
are
the
first
four
lines
there
was
a
young
tourist
from
home
who
baedekered
all
over
rome
said
a
lady
my
dear
do
you
like
the
things
here
now
you
see
you
must
each
make
a
fifth
oh
that
s
easy
said
milly
who
was
a
born
rhymer
they
all
sat
silently
for
a
few
moments
scribbling
or
nibbling
at
their
pencils
it
s
harder
than
i
thought
confessed
patty
i
can
t
think
of
a
thing
that
rhymes
and
makes
sense
at
last
the
lines
were
done
and
given
over
to
the
judges
we
ve
decided
said
nan
soon
after
but
we
ll
read
first
the
ones
that
did
not
win
the
prize
they
re
all
awfully
good
i
think
here
s
patty
s
first
shall
i
read
the
four
lines
no
we
all
know
those
just
read
the
very
well
this
is
it
she
said
when
they
say

a
pome

patty

next
here
s
lancaster
s
she
said
all
except
peter
s
dome
whew
i
suppose

tried
to
climb

said
caddy
i
did
once
this
is
a
good
one

nan

violet
s
it

prize
she
said

i
like
our
hippodrome
oh
that

fine
cried
patty
clapping
her
hands
why
didn
t
i
think
of
that
it
was
so
hard
to
find
a
but
here
s
the
prize
one
it
s
milly
s
i
think
you
ll
have
to
yield
her
the
palm
for
composition
i
ll
read
the
whole
this
time
there
was
a
young
tourist
from
home
who
baedekered
all
over
rome
said
a
lady
my
dear
do
you
like
the
things
here
she
looked
up
and
answered
why
no
you
see
this
fits
into
the
spirit
of
the
first
part
so
well
you
can
fairly
see
the
young
tourist
bored
to
death
tired
hurried
flurried
dazed
with
but
bound
to
go
on
with
it
why
should
she
like
things
here
oh
milly
yours
is
most
of
them
agreed
with
this
and
though
flo
and
the
two
van
winkles
secretly
thought
milly
s
line
rather
commonplace
they
didn
t
say
so
then
the
pretty
prize
was
bestowed
on
milly
and
her
eyes
shone
with
pleasure
and
justifiable
pride
in
her
own
success
and
when
the
party
broke
up
she
said
to
homer
i
ve
had
a
lovely
time
and
i
m
it
rained
and
we
couldn
t
go
that
s
a
good
girl
he
responded
and
i
m
jolly
glad
you
took
the
prize
and
we
ll
have
that
drive
yet
chapter
xii
patty
and
peter
it
was
the
day
before
the
fairfields
were
to
leave
rome
patty
and
peter
homer
sat
on
one
of
the
upper
flights
of
the
spanish
steps
waiting
for
flo
and
snippy
who
were
in
a
neighbouring
shop
the
beginning
of
the
sunset
hour
cast
a
warm
happy
light
and
patty
who
was
very
sensitive
to
the
peculiar
charms
of
this
most
delightful
part
of
rome
was
gazing
at
the
beautiful
staircase
that
seemed
to
ripple
down
from
the
church
of
trinita
dei
monti
to
the
fountain
below
peter
had
called
her
attention
before
to
the
construction
of
these
steps
and
she
had
learned
to
love
the
wonderful
effect
as
they
separated
and
joined
again
like
a
cascading
river
why
is
it
that
steps
are
so
beautiful
she
said
to
peter
who
was
also
enjoying
the
view
not
exactly
because
they
are
steps
he
replied
a
flight
of
stairs
is
not
necessarily
beautiful
but
when
designed
by
a
master
mind
with
knowledge
of
architectural
effect
and
symmetry
they
can
be
made
to
express
a
great
deal
but
don
t
try
too
hard
to
understand
just
look
at
it
all
and
i
do
and
i
shall
always
remember
this
my
last
afternoon
in
rome
sitting
here
in
the
sunset
with
me
interrupted
peter
yes
with
you
i
have
to
thank
you
for
much
of
my
pleasure
in
rome
without
what
you
have
told
me
and
taught
me
i
should
not
have
known
anything
about
the
real
rominess
of
you
don
t
know
much
about
it
yet
nor
do
i
but
we
ve
seen
a
little
of
it
together
and
i
too
shall
always
remember
our
good
times
very
frivolous
times
what
a
lot
of
fun
we
ve
had
with
our
foolish
picnics
and
yes
but
you
know
italy
of
itself
is
not
a
humorous
country
whatever
fun
one
gets
out
of
it
one
must
take
to
i
wonder
you
re
so
fond
of
fun
said
patty
musingly
when
you
re
so
what
i
sentimental
never
i
m
the
most
practical
man
in
the
oh
yes
you
re
practical
enough
but
you
re
sentimental
and
aren
t
you
i
don
t
know
no
i
don
t
think
i
i
don
t
think
you
are
exactly
either
but
i
think
you
will
be
some
day
and
as
a
beginning
couldn
t
you
cultivate
a
little
sentiment
toward
me
patty
looked
around
her
at
the
gold
and
violet
sunset
sky
above
them
the
sparkling
fountain
plashing
below
them
the
soft
twilight
atmosphere
about
them
and
the
roman
monuments
both
near
and
far
and
answered
if
i
ever
could
be
sentimental
it
would
be
here
and
nonsense
cried
peter
i
don
t
want
you
to
be
sentimental
save
that
for
venice
child
don
t
you
know
the
difference
between
sentiment
and
sentimentality
no
said
patty
in
surprise
is
there
any
you
re
hopeless
doesn
t
this
exquisite
moment
here
and
now
inspire
you
with
impulses
of
noble
sentiment
quite
removed
from
mawkish
sentimentality
i
don
t
know
said
honest
patty
what
sentiment
ought
i
to
feel
oh
i
don
t
want
to
suggest
look
in
your
own
heart
and
tell
me
if
there
s
no
pleasant
thought
there
for
this
especial
moment
and
for
me
patty
shut
her
eyes
tight
and
pondered
yes
she
said
triumphantly
i
know
what
you
mean
i
looked
in
my
heart
and
it
s
overflowing
with
a
sentiment
of
gratitude
for
your
kindness
to
for
once
patty
saw
peter
homer
look
positively
angry
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
he
exclaimed
or
rather
i
ought
to
i
should
know
better
than
to
expect
a
child
like
you
to
have
any
real
i
m
not
a
child
said
patty
offended
in
her
turn
i
m
over
eighteen
and
i
ve
lots
of
real
feeling
but
as
you
don
t
seem
to
care
for
it
i
won
t
waste
it
on
you
peter
laughed
at
the
indignant
look
on
patty
s
pretty
face
and
said
gaily
you
ve
plenty
of
time
little
one
your
sentiments
are
sprouting
and
they
ll
grow
rapidly
enough
once
they
re
started
thank
heaven
your
sense
of
humour
will
keep
them
from
growing
too
rank
now
soothe
my
wounded
feelings
by
telling
me
you
ve
a
nice
kind
sentiment
of
friendship
sprouting
in
your
heart
for
sprouting
why
my
friendship
for
you
sprouted
long
ago
now
it
s
grown
to
a
big
tree
and
on
every
leaf
is
written
a
kindly
thought
of
ah
you
imagination
and
that
s
closely
akin
to
sentiment
dear
little
patty
i
wish
i
could
teach
you
to
see
life
as
i
ve
taught
you
to
see
patty
looked
up
quickly
surprised
at
the
note
of
earnestness
in
his
voice
and
found
peter
s
dark
eyes
looking
steadily
into
her
own
i
wish
you
could
she
said
simply
as
her
own
clear
blue
eyes
frankly
returned
his
gaze
being
desirous
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
pretty
girl
on
the
steps
the
wayfarer
sat
down
beside
her
declaimed
the
ridiculous
voice
of
floyd
austin
as
he
appeared
before
them
and
dropped
down
on
the
step
beside
patty
why
floyd
she
cried
i
didn
t
see
you
coming
where
have
you
been
seeing
rome
and
hoping
i
d
see
you
which
by
good
luck
i
did
what
are
you
two
babes
in
the
wood
doing
here
all
alone
waiting
for
flo
and
snippy
they
re
in
that
shop
over
there
buying
um
yes
don
t
you
care
for
photographs
i
ve
bought
all
i
can
carry
already
i
shall
have
to
use
them
for
wall
paper
when
i
get
home
it
would
take
a
maine
forest
to
frame
them
i
saw
a
room
papered
with
photographs
once
said
peter
they
were
divided
by
narrow
mouldings
you
know
but
the
pictures
were
pasted
right
on
the
wasn
t
it
horrid
asked
patty
awful
photographs
in
great
quantities
are
awful
anyhow
but
while
we
re
on
the
subject
won
t
you
give
me
one
of
yourself
to
hang
on
my
memory
chain
you
i
d
ask
for
one
too
put
in
floyd
but
i
ve
seven
of
you
already
patty
snapshots
but
good
i
don
t
see
why
he
should
have
seven
and
i
none
said
peter
in
a
plaintive
voice
i
ll
give
you
one
said
floyd
generously
no
thank
you
i
don
t
want
it
but
what
i
do
want
patty
is
to
take
a
snapshot
of
you
right
now
here
on
the
spanish
you
ve
no
camera
said
patty
i
can
get
one
in
a
minute
in
that
photograph
shop
they
keep
all
sorts
and
i
ll
just
borrow
one
long
enough
to
take
you
may
i
yes
if
the
light
s
good
enough
i
don
t
care
said
patty
indifferently
peter
looked
at
her
curiously
and
then
went
off
for
the
camera
having
achieved
his
heart
s
desire
the
young
man
tripped
gaily
away
said
floyd
mischievously
smiling
at
patty
here
comes
flo
cried
patty
as
snippy
and
her
charge
appeared
laden
with
long
pasteboard
rolls
now
we
can
all
be
in
the
so
we
can
said
floyd
homer
will
be
pleased
homer
returned
with
his
camera
to
find
a
group
ready
posed
for
him
floyd
had
arranged
them
and
snippy
sat
on
one
step
with
her
arms
outspread
in
a
classic
attitude
while
the
two
girls
stood
demurely
with
clasped
hands
on
either
side
a
step
below
floyd
above
and
behind
held
out
one
hand
with
beneficent
gesture
and
in
the
other
was
a
long
pasteboard
roll
which
he
used
as
a
trumpet
it
s
an
allegorical
group
he
announced
of
fame
blessing
a
bunch
of
entering
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
peter
focussed
his
camera
and
secured
what
afterward
turned
out
to
be
a
delightfully
ludicrous
picture
now
said
peter
in
the
tone
he
used
when
he
had
no
intention
of
being
contradicted
i
will
take
a
picture
of
patty
all
right
said
flo
not
caring
and
she
turned
away
to
talk
to
floyd
austin
lean
lightly
against
the
balustrade
said
peter
as
patty
stood
carelessly
on
the
steps
she
fell
into
the
position
he
had
suggested
and
against
the
background
of
innumerable
steps
above
below
and
on
either
side
the
girlish
figure
stood
out
in
fair
relief
the
white
serge
frock
with
its
graceful
long
coat
opening
over
a
soft
white
blouse
was
a
becoming
style
to
patty
and
suited
well
the
scheme
of
the
picture
her
soft
white
felt
hat
turned
back
from
her
ripply
gold
hair
and
a
filmy
white
liberty
scarf
trailed
from
it
and
fluttered
over
her
shoulder
she
was
the
embodiment
of
quiet
graceful
american
girlhood
and
the
picturesque
roman
surroundings
accented
her
charm
peter
homer
held
his
breath
as
he
adjusted
the
camera
don
t
move
he
begged
it
s
i
ve
no
intention
of
moving
said
patty
calmly
take
your
it
was
one
of
the
girl
s
best
traits
that
she
was
never
and
so
she
was
never
embarrassed
at
posing
for
a
picture
in
fact
she
rather
enjoyed
it
as
she
was
fond
of
photographs
of
all
sorts
all
over
announced
peter
homer
as
he
snapped
the
camera
for
the
last
time
now
if
you
people
will
wait
till
i
take
this
machine
back
to
its
home
i
ll
invite
you
all
to
tea
right
here
and
goody
cried
patty
i
m
starving
and
they
have
the
loveliest
cakes
in
this
tearoom
of
all
snippy
was
graciously
pleased
to
accept
the
invitation
and
soon
they
were
gathered
round
a
tea
table
and
patty
had
all
the
cakes
she
desired
when
can
we
see
the
pictures
asked
flo
as
soon
as
i
can
get
them
developed
you
may
each
have
copies
of
that
stunning
classic
group
you
posed
in
but
the
landscape
of
miss
fairfield
is
all
for
my
little
own
can
t
i
have
one
asked
patty
no
madame

patty

t
want
a
picture
of
myself
anyway
i
d
rather
have
one
of
i
ll
send
you
one
said
peter
quietly
not
being
members
of
the
picture
exchange
the
other
guests
turned
their
attention
to
tea
and
muffins
said
floyd
in
a
resigned
way
as
he
appropriated
more
muffins
and
begged
snippy
to
pour
him
another
cup
of
tea
it
doesn
t
seem
possible
said
flo
that
we
ve
been
here
over
a
month
does
it
patty
no
indeed
seems
more
like
a
week
oh
i
know
i
shan
t
like
florence
as
well
as
rome
and
then
too
all
you
boys
won
t
be
there
i
do
love
boys
said
patty
contemplatively
as
she
broke
a
bit
of
frosting
off
her
cake
and
gazed
at
the
two
young
men
before
her
thank
you
old
lady
said
floyd
and
do
you
class
this
stalwart
gentleman
and
myself
among
your
beloved
boys
oh
i
don
t
know
i
suppose
you
too
old
to
be
called
boys
but
anyway
you
re
the
ones
i
meant
you
and
lank
and
caddy
why
i
m
so
used
to
having
you
all
bothering
around
i
ll
be
awfully
lonesome
in
florence
i
know
i
you
ll
have
me
said
flo
i
m
yes
you
are
and
perhaps
we
ll
have
more
fun
without
the
boys
they
do
tease
so
as
said
about
the
patty
s
roguish
smile
contradicted
her
speech
and
both
men
knew
it
don
t
be
so
sure
you
won
t
see
us
in
florence
said
floyd
my
ticket
is
most
accommodating
isn
t
yours
homer
no
said
peter
shortly
at
least
it
doesn
t
include
florence
among
its
i
m
sorry
said
patty
gently
i
d
be
glad
to
see
you
there
are
you
really
coming
floyd
i
don
t
know
yet
how
long
shall
you
be
there
about
a
fortnight
i
think
perhaps
longer
it
depends
on
how
father
and
nan
like
and
you
yes
and
i
but
i
m
so
i
always
agree
with
that
s
a
good
one
said
floyd
when
it
s
well
known
that
you
re
the
dictator
of
the
fairfield
only
when
i
care
said
patty
and
i
don
t
often
well
i
care
that
you
re
going
away
said
floyd
and
i
shall
follow
you
if
possible
as
soon
as
i
chapter
xiii
a
noble
soldier
the
fairfields
were
to
leave
rome
for
florence
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
flo
and
snippy
were
to
go
with
them
patty
s
regret
at
leaving
rome
was
somewhat
lessened
by
her
father
s
promise
that
they
should
return
there
for
a
week
or
two
after
visiting
florence
and
venice
for
you
know
father
she
said
i
really
ought
to
come
back
here
and
brush
up
my
memories
of
roman
history
before
going
back
yes
agreed
fairfield
particularly
as
your
knowledge
of
roman
history
is
confined
to
picnics
in
the
forum
lunches
on
the
palatine
and
tearooms
on
the
spanish
well
i
do
know
a
few
important
facts
about
the
roman
emperors
and
if
i
get
them
mixed
up
that
s
because
there
were
so
many
of
the
emperors
and
so
few
of
you
re
a
frivolous
puss
pattykins
but
as
you
re
on
a
pleasure
trip
i
don
t
suppose
you
can
take
time
for
useful
but
that
s
just
what
i
do
get
dusty
musty
fusty
knowledge
about
the
inner
workings
of
the
roman
empire
isn
t
a
bit
useful
to
a
great
big
girl
like
me
and
the
varied
bits
of
information
that
i
pick
up
with
both
hands
as
i
go
along
will
cheer
and
amuse
me
all
my
i
believe
you
re
right
you
wise
child
you
know
how
to
have
a
good
time
anyway
and
i
m
glad
of
it
now
run
along
and
say
your
to
that
flock
of
young
people
waiting
for
patty
was
all
ready
to
start
on
their
journey
and
her
travelling
costume
of
blue
rajah
silk
that
just
matched
her
eyes
was
both
appropriate
and
becoming
her
straw
hat
was
trimmed
with
blue
roses
which
though
not
of
nature
s
tint
were
most
harmonious
and
she
wore
a
long
filmy
blue
veil
which
was
a
characteristic
article
of
her
attire
why
do
you
always
have
these
uncertain
things
trailing
around
you
patty
asked
floyd
as
an
end
of
the
veil
brushed
against
his
cheek
oh
they
re
so
comforting
laughed
patty
as
she
disentangled
her
scarf
from
his
grasping
fingers
the
wonderers
had
gathered
in
the
palm
garden
to
say
to
patty
milly
mills
was
in
tears
for
patty
had
been
very
kind
to
her
and
the
strange
silent
girl
had
learned
to
love
her
dearly
i
wonder
what
we
ll
do
without
our
patsy
said
violet
as
she
caressed
patty
s
hand
follow
her
up
said
lank
promptly
i
ve
been
trying
to
persuade
the
governor
to
go
on
to
florence
and
though
he
says
no
he
s
sort
of
about
it
perhaps
you
can
coax
him
round
perhaps
i
can
said
violet
smiling
hopefully
i
ll
try
anyway
and
if
not
we
ll
meet
in
new
york
won
t
we
patty
yes
indeed
we
re
going
to
have
a
reunion
there
some
day
and
all
the
wonderers
will
walk
on
broadway
and
fifth
avenue
hunting
for
something
to
wonder
and
finding
it
too
said
lank
we
ll
show
europeans
that
little
old
is
sounds
like
a
riddle
said
caddy
oram
but
i
m
going
to
the
states
some
day
and
indeed
we
will
have
a
reunion
if
we
can
t
have
the
whole
eight
at
once
we
ll
reune
a
few
at
a
do
come
said
patty
cordially
all
of
you
whenever
you
then
they
all
exchanged
addresses
and
promised
to
write
letters
and
send
pictures
and
meet
whenever
possible
and
then
the
hotel
omnibus
was
at
the
door
to
take
the
travellers
to
the
station
come
patty
said
her
father
as
she
lingered
for
a
last
word
to
milly
you
ll
make
us
all
miss
the
train
if
you
spin
out
your
farewells
any
longer
hop
in
he
helped
patty
into
the
omnibus
jumped
in
himself
and
then
they
were
off
leaving
the
young
people
and
and
van
winkle
waving
handkerchiefs
after
them
isn
t
it
funny
said
flo
after
they
were
settled
in
their
chairs
in
the
train
and
rolling
toward
florence
how
as
soon
as
you
leave
one
place
your
mind
flies
ahead
to
the
place
you
re
going
to
yes
it
is
agreed
patty
now
i
just
love
rome
and
i
love
that
whole
bunch
of
people
we
ve
left
behind
us
but
i
m
already
wondering
what
florence
will
be
like
what
s
it
like
snippy
well
miss
patty
it
isn
t
a
bit
like
rome
to
begin
no
i
suppose
not
there
are
no
no
miss
but
there
are
beautiful
gardens
and
pictures
and
statues
till
you
most
wear
your
poor
eyes
yes
and
break
the
back
of
your
neck
picture
galleries
are
worse
than
quinsy
sore
but
that
s
in
front
said
flo
laughing
pictures
make
you
ache
in
the
back
of
your
they
make
me
ache
all
round
declared
patty
i
love
em
but
they
wear
me
oh
patty
cried
flo
look
at
the
orchards
with
the
trees
tied
together
isn
t
it
lovely
patty
looked
from
the
window
at
the
thick
ropes
of
grapevines
which
festooned
one
tree
to
another
in
the
orchards
past
which
their
train
was
flying
great
she
exclaimed
her
eyes
shining
at
the
beautiful
sight
they
look
like
the
alpine
travellers
who
are
roped
together
for
nonsense
said
practical
flo
what
s
the
use
of
roping
yourselves
together
if
you
re
standing
still
they
re
not
well
said
patty
our
train
goes
so
fast
that
it
makes
them
look
as
if
they
were
moving
so
it
s
well
they
re
tied
you
re
a
goose
remarked
flo
as
if
that
settled
the
matter
i
say
patty
isn
t
this
a
funny
car
i
suppose
it
is
to
you
said
patty
looking
around
at
the
car
they
were
in
it
s
unusual
in
italy
i
m
sure
and
i
never
saw
one
like
it
in
england
but
it
s
exactly
like
the
we
have
in
is
it
well
i
like
it
a
lot
better
like
this
where
we
re
all
in
one
room
and
can
see
our
fellow
passengers
than
to
be
shut
up
in
those
little
compartments
and
only
see
our
own
yes
said
patty
doubtfully
but
the
other
way
is
more
cosy
i
ve
no
desire
to
see
my
fellow
travellers
have
you
yes
i
like
to
look
at
them
and
wonder
what
they
re
like
for
instance
see
those
two
young
italian
men
over
there
i
m
sure
they
re
nobles
counts
probably
aren
t
they
handsome
flo
carrington
you
stop
looking
at
handsome
young
italians
or
i
ll
call
snippy
s
attention
to
oh
they
don
t
know
i
m
looking
at
don
t
they
indeed
well
they
do
and
you
must
stop
i
have
stopped
said
flo
looking
out
of
the
window
but
aren
t
they
stunning
they
were
handsome
young
fellows
and
had
an
air
of
dignity
such
as
might
well
befit
an
italian
noble
flo
and
patty
demurely
refrained
from
glancing
at
them
save
for
a
furtive
glance
now
and
then
but
flo
declared
she
must
make
a
sketch
of
them
she
undertook
it
but
the
train
jolted
too
much
to
make
drawing
a
pleasure
so
she
abandoned
the
project
soon
the
guard
came
through
asking
for
those
who
wished
to
lunch
in
the
and
tickets
were
given
for
seats
at
table
i
perfectly
love
to
eat
on
an
italian
train
don
t
you
said
patty
as
they
found
their
places
for
luncheon
yes
i
do
said
flo
except
i
don
t
like
the
spaghetti
and
things
they
love
to
oh
i
do
and
i
m
sure
when
i
get
home
i
can
cook
macaroni
in
true
italian
fashion
and
delight
all
my
it
wouldn
t
delight
me
i
hate
it
but
i
love
the
and
well
she
might
for
the
rich
luscious
fruits
of
italy
are
surpassed
nowhere
on
the
globe
and
they
are
bestowed
on
travellers
in
unstinted
quantities
and
fairfield
sat
at
one
of
the
tables
arranged
for
two
while
snippy
and
the
two
girls
sat
at
a
quartette
table
as
there
was
thus
a
vacant
seat
another
passenger
was
assigned
to
it
and
to
the
surprise
and
secret
glee
of
the
girls
it
was
one
of
the
young
italian
men
they
had
noticed
in
the
other
car
flo
and
patty
looked
down
at
their
plates
in
an
effort
not
to
smile
at
each
other
and
snippy
glared
at
the
young
man
as
if
he
were
an
intruder
presently
he
made
a
civil
remark
in
italian
and
as
snippy
was
able
to
talk
fluently
in
that
tongue
she
answered
him
politely
but
rather
shortly
doesn
t
he
speak
english
at
all
said
patty
with
great
interest
no
said
snippy
sternly
eat
your
luncheon
and
don
t
look
at
good
gracious
said
patty
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
the
stranger
couldn
t
understand
her
i
don
t
want
to
look
at
him
but
i
just
want
to
know
if
he
s
a
count
do
ask
him
snippy
dear
flo
thinks
he
is
and
i
think
he
isn
well
he
isn
t
miss
patty
he
s
a
a
soldier
how
interesting
can
t
we
talk
to
him
a
little
snippy
with
you
to
translate
you
snippy
hesitated
the
young
man
was
exceedingly
polite
and
and
had
already
asked
if
the
young
ladies
spoke
italian
even
her
careful
instincts
could
suggest
no
reason
why
they
should
not
converse
with
herself
as
interpreter
so
in
very
conventional
language
she
introduced
signor
grimaldi
to
her
two
young
charges
and
he
bowed
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
a
distinguished
cavalier
ask
him
where
he
s
going
said
patty
who
knew
that
snippy
would
frame
the
question
less
curtly
a
few
words
of
italian
passed
between
them
and
then
snippy
informed
the
waiting
ears
that
the
signor
was
going
to
florence
what
hotel
asked
flo
and
the
information
was
soon
gained
that
he
was
going
to
the
same
hotel
that
they
were
themselves
heavenly
said
patty
rolling
her
eyes
dramatically
tell
him
we
re
enchanted
and
that
we
think
he
s
a
lovely
man
and
that
he
looks
as
if
he
had
just
stepped
out
of
a
comic
opera
and
that
there
there
miss
patty
how
you
do
run
on
i
shall
tell
him
none
of
those
things
he
s
a
very
chivalrous
gentleman
and
i
don
t
want
him
to
think
you
a
forward
young
he
can
t
think
anything
about
me
snippy
except
what
you
tell
him
so
tell
him
i
m
a
lovely
lady
a
duchess
disguised
as
an
he
d
never
take
you
for
a
duchess
patty
said
flo
tell
him
i
m
a
duchess
snip
and
that
this
other
young
woman
is
my
i
ll
tell
him
nothing
i
m
ashamed
of
your
foolishness
miss
and
snippy
proceeded
to
eat
her
luncheon
with
such
a
air
that
the
italian
soldier
wondered
what
he
had
done
to
deserve
reproof
presently
he
spoke
again
to
snippy
regarding
the
scenery
and
to
make
amends
for
her
previous
coolness
she
answered
him
affably
then
there
ensued
an
interested
conversation
for
snippy
was
a
cultivated
and
woman
and
the
young
man
was
courteous
and
entertaining
besides
which
he
was
greatly
attracted
by
the
two
pretty
girls
and
wished
the
duenna
would
bring
them
into
the
conversation
the
young
ladies
have
they
visited
florence
before
he
asked
finally
in
italian
and
snippy
felt
in
honour
bound
to
pass
the
question
on
in
english
to
eager
patty
and
flo
we
must
answer
prettily
said
patty
with
a
demure
face
though
her
eyes
were
dancing
or
else
snippy
won
t
let
us
talk
to
him
at
all
say
to
the
signor
please
that
we
have
never
before
been
in
florence
and
does
he
think
we
ll
like
snippy
sniffed
a
little
but
translated
the
message
to
the
italian
the
signor
says
she
translated
again
that
he
is
sure
you
will
like
florence
and
florence
will
like
remark
to
him
went
on
patty
that
we
thank
him
for
his
politeness
and
we
d
like
to
know
if
the
gentleman
who
was
with
him
in
the
other
car
is
travelling
with
him
and
what
is
his
noble
the
other
gentleman
is
with
him
his
name
is
signor
balotti
and
he
too
is
a
then
put
in
flo
inquire
of
his
soldiership
why
they
are
not
he
says
resumed
snippy
that
they
do
not
fight
because
there
is
no
convenient
war
but
he
does
not
regret
that
since
it
gives
him
opportunity
to
meet
three
charming
oh
said
patty
are
you
sure
you
re
translating
truly
didn
t
he
say
one
charming
lady
and
two
if
he
didn
t
it
s
only
because
he
is
himself
too
polite
to
say
so
said
snippy
but
there
was
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
and
patty
could
see
that
she
had
quite
decided
in
favour
of
the
young
man
s
desirability
as
an
acquaintance
they
all
rose
from
the
tables
then
and
snippy
introduced
the
italian
to
fairfield
though
not
fluent
in
the
language
fairfield
could
make
himself
understood
and
while
the
ladies
returned
to
the
car
he
remained
behind
for
a
smoke
and
a
chat
with
the
young
man
when
he
returned
he
electrified
the
two
girls
and
nan
by
telling
them
that
signor
grimaldi
was
a
very
desirable
acquaintance
indeed
as
was
also
his
chum
signor
balotti
the
men
had
arranged
to
meet
them
again
in
florence
and
would
doubtless
be
a
decided
acquisition
to
their
circle
i
told
you
so
said
patty
i
knew
he
was
the
salt
of
the
earth
as
soon
as
i
looked
at
pooh
i
told
you
so
first
said
flo
but
i
wish
he
could
talk
english
i
don
t
care
much
about
knowing
people
i
can
t
talk
nor
i
said
patty
i
hope
we
will
find
some
americans
or
english
at
the
they
reached
florence
about
and
drove
directly
to
their
hotel
on
the
bank
of
the
arno
what
a
lovely
river
said
patty
at
least
it
s
clean
the
tiber
is
so
yellow
and
so
is
the
thames
the
seine
isn
t
much
better
indeed
none
of
them
can
compare
with
our
own
but
this
whole
place
is
beautiful
said
flo
as
they
looked
from
their
cab
on
the
trees
and
gardens
of
beautiful
florence
the
day
was
very
warm
and
there
was
a
glare
of
sun
everywhere
so
our
travellers
were
glad
to
reach
their
hotel
and
go
right
to
the
apartments
awaiting
them
flo
and
patty
had
communicating
rooms
and
had
soon
exchanged
their
travelling
costumes
for
teagowns
and
were
waiting
for
the
tea
which
they
had
ordered
sent
up
they
peeped
out
between
the
slats
of
their
blinds
and
saw
the
river
directly
below
them
isn
t
it
picturesque
said
patty
i
love
it
already
after
an
hour
or
so
father
says
it
will
be
cool
and
pleasant
for
a
drive
so
we
ll
see
a
little
of
the
place
this
lovely
said
flo
but
here
s
our
tea
patty
so
come
and
drink
chapter
xiv
carlo
as
guide
the
first
night
that
patty
spent
in
florence
she
awoke
about
midnight
thinking
she
heard
music
i
must
have
been
dreaming
she
said
to
herself
and
then
again
she
heard
lovely
strains
as
of
some
one
singing
outside
her
window
she
jumped
up
and
ran
to
peep
through
the
blinds
sure
enough
a
small
crowd
of
people
stood
in
the
white
roadway
that
divided
the
hotel
from
the
river
and
four
men
were
singing
beautiful
music
the
others
were
who
had
stopped
to
listen
and
who
stood
about
or
sat
on
the
low
parapet
i
m
being
serenaded
thought
patty
it
must
be
by
those
two
italian
soldiers
flinging
on
a
kimono
she
flew
into
the
next
room
to
wake
flo
get
up
she
cried
shaking
the
sleeping
girl
get
up
signor
vaselino
or
whatever
his
name
is
is
serenading
us
what
murmured
sleepy
flo
oh
get
up
you
slow
thing
get
up
first
and
understand
afterward
here
s
your
here
are
your
slippers
put
your
foot
in
jamming
the
worsted
slippers
on
flo
s
bare
feet
patty
gave
her
one
more
shake
and
succeeded
in
fully
wakening
her
they
went
to
flo
s
window
and
opening
the
blinds
stepped
out
on
the
little
balcony
it
was
a
perfect
night
although
the
first
of
october
it
was
warm
and
balmy
and
the
great
full
moon
cast
a
golden
glow
on
the
smooth
water
of
the
arno
the
four
men
who
were
singing
wore
picturesque
italian
costumes
and
their
hats
turned
up
with
feathers
gave
the
effect
of
a
comic
opera
chorus
the
bright
moonlight
made
the
shadows
of
the
people
clear
and
distinct
along
the
white
road
and
the
river
with
the
buildings
rising
on
its
other
bank
was
a
perfect
background
isn
t
it
great
whispered
patty
squeezing
flo
s
arm
do
you
suppose
it
s
our
italian
friend
that
we
met
on
the
train
no
you
goose
said
flo
laughing
this
isn
t
a
serenade
especially
for
us
they
re
professional
singers
and
they
re
serenading
the
whole
hotel
see
the
other
people
on
their
sure
enough
every
room
in
the
hotel
that
had
its
own
balcony
showed
its
occupants
standing
out
there
to
enjoy
the
music
and
windows
that
had
no
balconies
were
thrown
wide
open
and
faces
appeared
at
each
well
said
patty
this
is
a
nice
country
where
the
opera
singers
give
free
concerts
at
they
re
not
entirely
free
said
flo
who
seemed
to
know
more
about
the
matter
than
patty
observe
what
now
the
song
came
to
an
end
and
after
flourishing
bows
the
quartette
stood
expectantly
waiting
soon
something
was
thrown
from
a
window
and
as
it
fell
in
the
road
one
of
the
singers
stooped
for
it
and
then
they
all
bowed
again
it
was
a
coin
flung
by
one
of
the
hotel
guests
and
it
was
quickly
followed
by
others
until
the
singers
were
all
four
scrambling
on
the
ground
picking
up
the
coppers
and
small
silver
bits
that
had
rained
down
upon
them
sometimes
a
coin
was
flung
wide
of
the
mark
and
this
was
picked
up
by
the
idle
bystanders
and
usually
given
to
one
of
the
singers
then
they
sang
again
and
this
time
patty
ran
for
her
purse
to
take
part
in
the
recognition
of
the
music
after
this
song
she
and
flo
threw
down
coins
too
and
it
was
great
fun
to
watch
the
musicians
pick
them
up
probably
from
much
practice
they
were
very
deft
at
this
and
as
the
hotel
was
a
large
one
and
well
filled
with
people
they
reaped
a
fine
harvest
at
last
having
doubtless
noticed
american
voices
among
their
audience
they
sang
yankee
doodle
though
a
very
much
italianised
version
of
that
classic
composition
however
it
struck
a
patriotic
chord
and
from
many
of
the
hotel
windows
american
voices
joined
in
the
chorus
after
this
tribute
to
her
native
land
patty
flung
down
all
her
small
change
and
finally
the
minstrels
wandered
away
to
serenade
some
other
hostelry
wasn
t
that
fun
said
patty
as
she
and
flo
returned
to
their
rooms
i
think
italians
must
be
very
honest
people
or
the
others
would
have
taken
the
money
instead
of
the
perhaps
they
did
said
flo
or
some
of
those
others
may
have
been
friends
of
the
singers
who
picked
up
the
money
for
well
it
s
a
pretty
trick
said
patty
much
nicer
than
i
yes
or
street
pianos
agreed
flo
and
now
if
you
ll
kindly
go
back
where
you
belong
i
ll
return
to
my
own
slumbers
and
don
t
wake
me
up
again
if
the
united
states
marine
band
comes
over
to
give
a
indeed
i
won
t
you
ungrateful
creature
i
ll
just
enjoy
it
all
by
so
patty
went
back
to
bed
and
slept
until
the
sun
shone
high
over
the
arno
in
place
of
the
moon
the
weeks
in
florence
passed
rapidly
it
seemed
to
the
two
girls
each
day
patty
grew
to
love
the
beautiful
city
more
it
goes
along
so
smoothly
she
said
to
nan
one
day
in
rome
we
were
always
flying
around
after
some
excitement
but
florence
days
just
flow
by
all
exactly
why
patty
i
think
our
days
are
varied
a
great
deal
replied
nan
who
was
tying
her
veil
and
was
devoting
most
of
her
attention
to
that
no
they
re
not
we
always
go
to
picture
galleries
in
the
morning
and
shopping
or
for
a
drive
in
the
gardens
in
the
afternoon
and
then
dinner
takes
up
most
of
the
evening
but
i
like
it
i
m
not
complaining
at
all
and
i
m
learning
heaps
about
pictures
i
didn
t
know
i
could
learn
so
much
just
by
looking
at
them
why
some
of
my
favourites
i
almost
feel
as
if
i
had
painted
it
must
be
fine
to
have
such
a
good
opinion
of
yourself
laughed
nan
where
are
you
going
this
morning
oh
snippy
s
laid
aside
with
a
headache
and
as
you
and
dad
are
going
off
on
an
excursion
he
said
flo
and
i
might
go
out
with
well
have
a
good
time
we
ll
be
back
by
tea
time
so
be
in
the
palm
room
by
five
some
people
are
nan
ran
away
to
go
off
on
a
day
s
jaunt
with
her
husband
and
flo
and
patty
put
on
their
hats
to
go
for
a
drive
with
carlo
this
very
useful
italian
citizen
was
a
guide
who
had
been
recommended
to
fairfield
by
an
old
friend
carlo
was
experienced
in
all
styles
of
and
moreover
was
trusty
and
reliable
in
every
way
so
fairfield
allowed
flo
and
patty
to
go
with
him
to
galleries
and
museums
and
carlo
proved
a
most
satisfactory
cicerone
and
chaperon
the
cab
came
to
the
door
and
carlo
assisted
the
two
girls
into
it
where
to
ladies
he
asked
as
he
stood
at
attention
oh
i
don
t
know
said
patty
we
ve
seen
most
everything
where
shall
we
go
flo
to
dante
s
house
was
the
prompt
reply
we
haven
t
seen
all
right
said
patty
to
dante
s
house
non
ladies
non
was
the
unexpected
reply
to
the
great
galleries
yes
to
the
great
monuments
yes
to
the
gardens
yes
but
to
a
house
a
so
plain
uncertain
house
which
in
maybe
dante
was
born
maybe
no
no
we
do
not
go
to
dante
s
house
it
is
a
patty
laughed
she
well
knew
carlo
s
dictatorial
ways
and
if
he
didn
t
think
dante
s
house
worth
seeing
it
probably
wasn
t
i
don
t
care
carlo
she
said
go
where
you
like
it
s
a
lovely
morning
and
i
m
so
amiable
i
d
follow
anybody
s
advice
you
don
t
care
do
you
flo
not
a
bit
let
s
leave
it
to
then
ladies
i
take
you
once
again
to
the
baptistery
i
wish
you
to
look
again
at
the
bronze
doors
of
go
ahead
said
patty
i
know
those
doors
by
heart
i
know
what
michael
angelo
said
about
them
and
i
have
both
sepia
and
coloured
postcards
of
them
but
go
on
we
can
t
have
too
much
of
the
bronze
carlo
though
he
spoke
english
was
not
always
quick
enough
to
grasp
the
whole
of
patty
s
raillery
but
he
saw
she
was
willing
to
follow
his
advice
so
he
took
the
seat
beside
the
cabdriver
and
they
rumbled
away
when
they
reached
the
baptistery
they
stood
in
front
of
the
great
doors
and
listened
patiently
while
carlo
repeated
the
meanings
of
the
designs
it
was
owing
to
these
repeated
descriptions
of
carlo
s
that
patty
was
acquiring
a
really
good
appreciation
of
painting
and
sculpture
and
though
she
mildly
chaffed
the
guide
she
listened
thoughtfully
to
his
lectures
you
re
a
fine
guide
carlo
she
said
you
told
all
that
exactly
as
you
told
it
last
time
i
think
you
re
the
best
guide
in
all
oh
no
lady
said
carlo
with
a
gesture
of
deprecation
verra
pore
guide
i
simply
do
my
best
to
serve
the
kind
patrons
who
honour
me
i
speak
but
only
eight
of
the
only
eight
exclaimed
patty
in
a
teasing
tone
for
she
well
knew
this
was
mock
modesty
and
carlo
was
really
proud
of
his
linguistic
acquirements
yes
eight
it
is
but
oh
well
it
will
do
for
us
said
patty
i
only
know
one
that
is
enough
for
a
lady
said
carlo
so
gallantly
that
flo
and
patty
laughed
you
know
a
lot
of
languages
carlo
patty
said
and
better
than
that
you
can
be
tactful
in
all
of
ah
i
am
a
florentine
said
carlo
bowing
with
native
pride
in
his
birth
that
he
scorned
to
admit
in
his
acquirements
but
ladies
here
comes
a
so
good
opportunity
a
bambino
a
baby
is
arriving
for
baptism
we
will
go
in
and
observe
the
we
will
indeed
said
patty
i
ve
always
just
missed
it
before
come
on
inside
the
baptistery
they
went
and
found
a
priest
and
a
few
officials
gathered
around
the
font
with
great
interest
they
watched
the
baptism
of
the
tiny
old
infant
the
little
one
was
carried
by
its
father
and
accompanied
by
a
nurse
and
an
italian
lady
presumably
an
aunt
or
other
relative
the
child
was
robed
in
a
grand
conglomeration
of
laces
ribbons
jewelry
and
swathed
in
voluminous
outer
wrappings
after
the
short
ceremonial
was
over
the
girls
lingered
to
look
at
the
mosaics
in
the
choir
a
study
in
which
patty
was
taking
a
great
interest
as
they
stood
there
patty
heard
a
voice
over
her
shoulder
addressing
her
in
italian
she
turned
and
saw
the
italian
soldier
signor
grimaldi
accompanied
by
his
friend
balotti
they
had
not
seen
these
men
since
the
meeting
on
the
train
and
they
had
wondered
what
had
become
of
them
oh
signor
how
do
you
do
cried
patty
quite
forgetting
that
he
couldn
t
understand
her
but
he
understood
the
smile
and
gesture
and
shook
hands
cordially
with
patty
and
flo
and
then
presented
signor
balotti
this
introduction
was
in
italian
but
the
girls
assumed
its
intent
and
smiled
pleasantly
at
both
men
though
at
a
loss
how
to
continue
the
conversation
we
can
talk
through
carlo
said
patty
with
a
sudden
inspiration
what
s
the
use
of
his
eight
languages
if
he
can
t
help
us
out
in
a
case
like
this
carlo
these
are
two
friends
of
ours
but
they
can
t
speak
english
nor
we
italian
so
you
must
act
as
interpreter
see
yes
lady
said
carlo
a
little
hesitatingly
they
are
your
before
acquaintances
oh
yes
said
patty
laughing
at
his
air
of
caution
we
met
them
on
the
train
coming
from
rome
at
least
we
met
grimaldi
and
were
properly
introduced
ask
him
why
he
hasn
t
been
to
see
reassured
carlo
talked
to
the
young
men
and
translated
back
and
forth
for
the
benefit
of
both
sides
it
seemed
that
the
italians
had
mistaken
the
name
of
the
hotel
where
the
fairfields
were
and
had
not
been
able
to
find
them
they
themselves
being
at
a
different
one
but
i
spik
a
very
small
angleesh
volunteered
signor
balotti
timidly
and
the
girls
turned
to
him
in
delight
oh
do
you
said
flo
then
you
can
help
us
all
so
they
chatted
away
and
as
each
only
understood
about
a
quarter
of
what
the
other
said
the
conversation
was
mostly
laughter
and
gestures
at
last
with
the
help
of
carlo
the
young
men
conveyed
to
the
girls
an
invitation
to
visit
some
certain
of
the
royal
apartments
in
the
pitti
palace
which
are
not
usually
shown
to
visitors
the
idea
appealed
to
carlo
who
wanted
his
patrons
to
see
all
that
they
could
but
he
hesitated
about
accepting
the
escort
of
these
handsome
young
strangers
oh
yes
we
ll
go
cried
patty
after
she
learned
of
the
invitation
don
t
be
a
goose
carlo
you
re
worse
than
snippy
i
ll
take
the
responsibility
and
i
ll
tell
father
all
about
it
and
he
ll
say
bless
you
my
come
on
then
turning
to
signor
balotti
she
smiled
and
said
si
signor
we
will
go
avec
the
polyglot
sentence
was
not
very
intelligible
but
the
smile
was
and
carlo
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
to
carry
out
the
plan
their
cab
was
dismissed
and
a
larger
carriage
called
which
would
hold
the
four
and
again
carlo
climbed
to
the
seat
beside
the
driver
and
they
were
off
conversation
was
now
difficult
but
that
made
it
only
more
interesting
where
do
you
live
asked
patty
choosing
a
simple
question
as
a
beginning
this
signor
balotti
understood
but
his
reply
was
entirely
unintelligible
and
as
patty
didn
t
care
where
they
lived
she
gave
it
up
the
boboli
gardens
are
very
beautiful
volunteered
flo
willing
to
do
her
share
to
break
a
silence
that
might
become
embarrassing
boboli
no
not
this
hora
said
balotti
with
a
regretful
smile
goodness
said
flo
he
thinks
i
m
asking
him
to
take
us
there
and
he
says
not
at
this
hora
that
s
hour
isn
t
it
patty
yes
she
doesn
t
mean
we
want
to
go
there
but
that
it
is
beautiful
bella
bellissimo
see
si
responded
balotti
repeating
without
understanding
so
pretty
you
know
patty
floundered
on
so
green
and
trees
and
flowers
flora
gracious
flo
what
is
italian
for
flowers
you
ought
to
know
i
don
t
said
flo
but
look
this
way
and
flo
sniffed
vigorously
at
an
imaginary
bouquet
her
dramatic
instinct
was
so
strong
that
her
meaning
was
quite
evident
and
one
could
almost
imagine
she
had
beautiful
flowers
in
her
hands
si
si
si
exclaimed
the
gallant
balotti
and
with
an
order
in
italian
for
the
driver
to
stop
he
sprang
from
the
carriage
and
flew
over
to
a
neighbouring
flower
stand
he
returned
with
two
huge
nosegays
which
he
bestowed
upon
the
girls
with
a
voluble
flow
of
italian
compliments
oh
patty
said
flo
blushing
with
mortification
he
thinks
we
asked
him
for
flowers
si
si
said
balotti
beaming
with
pleasure
at
having
gratified
the
wishes
of
the
young
ladies
to
patty
s
surprise
carlo
took
the
flower
episode
calmly
and
she
concluded
that
a
gift
of
flowers
in
italy
must
mean
even
less
than
in
america
yes
said
carlo
when
she
asked
him
this
yes
the
signori
mean
to
present
the
compliments
they
can
not
speak
by
means
of
the
so
beautiful
thank
them
very
much
said
patty
they
are
most
but
her
own
smiling
bows
of
appreciation
were
quite
as
welcome
to
the
gallant
balotti
as
carlo
s
expressed
thanks
and
now
gloom
settled
on
the
handsome
face
of
signor
grimaldi
he
wants
that
he
too
said
balotti
this
seemed
obscure
at
first
but
the
discontented
expression
helped
patty
s
quick
wit
and
she
exclaimed
oh
grimaldi
wants
to
give
us
flowers
also
yes
said
balotti
or
or
yes
said
flo
assisting
him
or
something
else
well
patty
we
must
accept
another
gift
i
see
that
clearly
what
do
you
suggest
that
we
can
take
with
propriety
and
thus
bring
smiles
to
grimaldi
s
face
as
well
as
spaghetti
s
i
mean
balotti
s
patty
looked
about
on
either
side
postcards
she
exclaimed
as
she
saw
a
vendor
with
his
tray
just
the
thing
cried
flo
tell
him
carlo
that
the
young
ladies
would
be
overjoyed
to
receive
the
gift
of
half
a
dozen
postcards
carlo
translated
this
and
signor
grimaldi
s
face
broke
into
wide
smiles
as
he
sprang
in
his
turn
from
the
carriage
tell
him
only
a
half
dozen
carlo
warned
patty
for
grimaldi
s
enthusiasm
betokened
his
buying
the
whole
tray
and
sending
the
man
for
more
but
he
obeyed
carlo
s
strict
orders
and
returned
bringing
flo
and
patty
each
six
of
the
most
celebrated
monuments
of
florence
the
girls
made
charming
protestations
of
gratitude
and
appreciation
of
this
courtesy
and
the
drive
continued
the
two
italians
pleased
with
their
own
performances
seemed
content
to
sit
and
beam
pleasantly
for
the
remainder
of
the
way
and
soon
they
were
at
the
portals
of
the
pitti
palace
as
the
young
men
had
promised
they
were
able
to
show
them
through
some
magnificent
royal
apartments
rarely
shown
to
strangers
and
where
even
carlo
himself
had
never
been
before
the
sights
were
most
interesting
and
after
a
pleasant
hour
spent
there
they
all
drove
back
to
the
hotel
the
italian
gentlemen
took
leave
and
through
the
interpretations
of
carlo
patty
asked
them
to
return
late
in
the
afternoon
and
take
tea
with
them
and
this
the
young
men
readily
promised
to
do
chapter
xv
to
florence
fairfield
was
not
at
all
displeased
to
learn
that
the
two
girls
had
gone
to
the
royal
palace
with
the
italian
men
for
he
trusted
to
carlo
s
notions
of
propriety
and
was
quite
willing
to
abide
by
his
decisions
but
snippy
was
less
agreeable
about
it
and
declared
that
hereafter
she
should
go
with
miss
flo
wherever
she
went
headache
or
no
headache
now
don
t
be
stuffy
snip
said
flo
in
reply
in
the
first
place
i
don
t
care
tuppence
for
those
two
native
gallants
for
i
can
t
talk
to
them
and
when
i
do
they
misunderstand
but
the
two
young
italians
seemed
much
attracted
by
the
whole
fairfield
party
and
nearly
every
day
after
that
they
dropped
in
to
tea
or
invited
them
to
go
on
little
excursions
or
brought
small
gifts
to
nan
and
the
girls
by
degrees
too
patty
and
flo
picked
up
a
few
italian
phrases
and
after
a
time
were
able
to
make
some
slight
attempts
at
conversation
which
greatly
delighted
the
two
men
so
really
they
added
not
a
little
to
the
pleasures
of
the
fairfields
stay
in
florence
and
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
leave
the
italian
gentlemen
were
quite
inconsolable
as
a
parting
favour
they
begged
that
the
whole
fairfield
party
would
lunch
with
them
on
their
last
day
in
florence
this
invitation
was
accepted
and
a
delightful
excursion
was
arranged
to
the
cascine
fairfield
stipulated
for
an
early
luncheon
as
their
train
left
for
venice
at
four
and
he
did
not
wish
to
be
hurried
at
the
last
moment
i
hate
to
take
an
afternoon
train
anyway
he
said
to
nan
i
like
to
start
in
the
morning
and
reach
our
destination
in
the
afternoon
but
leaving
florence
at
four
we
won
t
reach
venice
until
ten
or
well
it
doesn
t
really
matter
said
nan
and
the
girls
are
so
anxious
to
go
to
this
fête
of
signor
grimaldi
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
also
reassured
fairfield
you
are
going
to
the
royal
danieli
hotel
in
venice
he
said
and
have
your
rooms
engaged
well
they
will
meet
you
on
your
arrival
not
only
with
gondolas
but
with
motorboats
and
steam
launches
and
i
assure
you
you
will
have
not
the
least
care
or
responsibility
also
the
whole
place
will
be
as
bright
as
so
it
was
arranged
and
the
day
before
the
party
flo
and
patty
packed
their
trunks
and
had
everything
in
readiness
also
on
the
day
before
the
party
nan
received
a
telegram
from
a
friend
of
hers
who
was
passing
through
venice
and
who
urged
her
to
come
on
that
day
in
order
that
they
might
meet
nan
was
greatly
disappointed
not
to
see
her
friend
but
she
positively
refused
to
let
them
all
leave
a
day
earlier
and
thus
deprive
flo
and
patty
of
their
anticipated
pleasure
patty
insisted
that
they
should
do
this
but
nan
wouldn
t
agree
and
at
last
patty
said
well
i
ve
an
idea
you
and
father
go
on
to
venice
by
the
noon
train
then
we
ll
stay
here
for
the
party
and
snippy
can
take
us
to
venice
quite
well
this
sounded
plausible
but
fairfield
said
here
s
a
better
plan
still
let
snippy
and
nan
go
to
venice
thus
travelling
by
daylight
and
i
ll
stay
here
with
you
two
girls
and
take
you
to
venice
after
your
luncheon
party
if
any
of
us
are
to
travel
after
dark
in
an
unknown
country
i
prefer
to
look
after
the
this
was
more
sensible
as
snippy
and
nan
could
easily
catch
the
noon
train
that
day
and
so
give
nan
an
opportunity
to
see
her
friend
hotel
arrangements
were
made
by
telegraph
and
fairfield
put
the
two
ladies
on
the
train
knowing
his
wife
had
a
safe
and
pleasant
escort
in
the
grim
but
capable
englishwoman
we
ought
to
do
something
extra
gay
daddy
said
patty
to
console
you
for
nan
s
absence
it
was
awfully
good
of
her
to
arrange
it
all
this
way
rather
than
disappoint
flo
and
yes
i
think
it
was
agreed
fairfield
and
i
shall
expect
you
to
entertain
me
i
think
said
patty
the
most
fun
would
be
just
to
go
for
a
drive
and
shop
somewhere
and
eat
ices
off
those
funny
little
tables
that
stand
out
on
the
that
is
indeed
a
daring
proposition
said
her
father
smiling
but
i
ll
take
you
get
your
hats
and
flo
and
patty
were
soon
ready
and
away
they
went
for
a
drive
round
florence
by
night
it
isn
t
as
brilliant
as
broadway
said
patty
looking
about
at
the
lighted
streets
it
s
lighter
than
london
at
night
though
said
flo
yes
or
london
by
day
either
said
patty
who
knew
flo
never
resented
chaff
then
to
patty
s
delight
they
stopped
at
a
sidewalk
café
and
ate
ices
and
little
cakes
while
they
enjoyed
the
novel
scenes
all
about
often
whole
families
would
be
gathered
round
the
tables
and
little
children
would
sit
contentedly
nibbling
at
buns
or
pastry
it
s
lovely
said
patty
with
a
little
sigh
as
she
finished
her
ice
i
wouldn
t
live
here
for
anything
but
i
do
enjoy
seeing
it
so
do
i
said
flo
but
i
m
most
sure
i
ll
like
venice
better
than
florence
shan
t
you
patty
yes
i
expect
so
i
like
rome
better
too
but
still
florence
is
a
lovely
city
you
ought
to
love
it
best
flo
as
it
s
named
after
oh
it
s
pretty
enough
but
i
ve
always
been
just
crazy
to
see
the
girls
chatted
away
and
fairfield
smoked
a
cigar
and
then
said
they
must
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
to
bed
as
they
had
a
busy
day
ahead
of
them
with
their
party
first
and
the
journey
to
venice
after
and
i
thank
you
gracious
ladies
he
added
for
giving
me
a
most
pleasant
glad
you
enjoyed
it
said
patty
i
ve
had
lots
of
fun
watching
the
people
and
noticing
their
funny
on
the
way
home
they
stopped
at
one
or
two
shops
that
were
still
open
and
bought
a
few
more
of
the
delightful
bits
of
in
which
florence
abounds
i
m
simply
overburdened
now
with
little
boxes
and
carved
things
and
mosaics
and
plaster
casts
but
i
must
have
this
head
of
i
ve
seven
heads
of
dante
already
so
i
won
t
get
one
said
flo
he
must
have
been
a
monster
said
patty
i
think
it
fairly
rains
heads
of
dante
in
florence
but
i
ve
so
many
people
at
home
who
ll
be
glad
to
have
one
that
we
re
sending
a
the
next
day
was
fair
and
beautiful
for
their
little
excursion
their
two
italian
hosts
came
for
them
in
an
imposing
equipage
and
they
drove
out
to
the
park
or
cascine
as
it
is
called
patty
had
been
here
before
but
she
always
enjoyed
the
lovely
place
and
was
glad
to
pay
it
a
farewell
visit
the
conversation
was
rather
limited
but
they
were
used
to
that
now
and
laughs
and
gestures
often
made
up
what
they
could
not
express
in
words
fairfield
liked
the
two
young
men
and
endeavoured
to
make
himself
entertaining
so
far
as
his
slight
knowledge
of
italian
would
allow
the
festival
ended
rather
abruptly
as
the
travellers
must
run
no
risk
of
losing
their
train
and
the
girls
had
to
change
their
pretty
light
dresses
for
travelling
garb
why
are
you
carrying
your
furnished
handbag
said
flo
to
patty
as
they
left
the
hotel
we
won
t
be
on
the
train
over
no
but
there
isn
t
room
in
my
trunk
for
it
and
too
it
s
convenient
to
have
brushes
and
things
we
don
t
reach
venice
till
after
ten
o
clock
and
i
propose
to
take
a
nap
in
the
evening
hours
i
m
awfully
tired
so
am
i
those
natives
tired
me
well
we
ve
seen
the
last
of
them
i
don
t
know
they
talk
of
going
to
oh
i
hope
not
homer
and
floyd
austin
are
to
meet
us
there
and
i
don
t
want
those
smiling
popinjays
bothering
no
i
don
t
the
train
was
a
comfortable
one
and
the
party
were
soon
comfortably
settled
in
it
fairfield
had
not
been
able
to
secure
an
entire
compartment
for
themselves
and
as
they
occupied
but
three
seats
an
elderly
italian
couple
came
in
with
them
this
left
one
vacant
seat
into
which
the
girls
piled
their
wraps
and
some
magazines
and
also
some
candy
and
flowers
which
their
gallant
admirers
had
sent
them
as
a
parting
souvenir
they
had
previously
asked
the
italian
dame
by
smiles
and
signs
if
she
cared
to
use
this
vacant
seat
but
as
she
kept
on
her
queer
little
bonnet
and
cape
she
signed
that
she
had
no
use
for
it
fairfield
put
all
their
bags
and
hats
in
the
upper
racks
and
they
settled
down
for
a
long
but
not
unpleasant
ride
for
a
time
the
girls
chatted
and
then
patty
looked
over
some
magazines
and
papers
while
flo
crocheted
lace
which
was
a
favourite
occupation
of
hers
the
elderly
italian
gentleman
was
immersed
in
a
newspaper
and
his
wife
nodded
as
she
alternately
dozed
and
wakened
i
think
said
fairfield
as
he
at
last
folded
up
his
own
paper
i
think
i
can
leave
you
two
girls
for
half
an
hour
while
i
go
to
the
smoking
car
that
motherly
lady
will
do
for
chaperon
even
if
you
can
t
talk
much
to
each
of
course
said
patty
go
ahead
there
s
nothing
to
chaperon
us
about
but
i
just
adore
that
old
lady
s
looks
she
has
the
air
of
mothering
the
whole
that
s
true
said
fairfield
looking
at
the
lady
whose
eyes
were
closed
for
the
moment
she
s
one
of
the
best
types
of
italian
matron
well
then
i
ll
run
away
for
a
bit
the
guard
has
punched
our
tickets
so
you
won
t
be
bothered
and
if
any
luggage
official
speaks
to
you
refer
him
to
me
they
can
always
understand
he
went
away
and
patty
hoped
her
father
would
find
some
one
in
the
smoker
with
whom
he
could
talk
and
so
while
away
the
time
the
italian
lady
looked
up
as
fairfield
left
the
compartment
and
at
his
smiling
gestures
of
adieu
and
his
nod
toward
the
girls
she
quite
understood
that
she
was
to
lend
them
her
chaperonage
and
nodded
assent
with
a
beaming
face
amerika
she
said
smiling
kindly
at
patty
si
signora
said
patty
in
her
pretty
polite
way
amerique
she
asked
pointing
to
flo
non
non
said
the
dame
engleesh
si
agreed
patty
and
there
the
conversation
stopped
much
to
patty
s
regret
for
she
wanted
to
talk
to
her
friend
i
shall
study
italian
before
i
come
again
she
said
to
flo
it
isn
t
necessary
for
travelling
purposes
i
mean
guards
and
hotel
clerks
but
it
is
if
you
want
to
converse
with
your
fellow
yes
agreed
flo
but
it
s
awfully
hard
to
in
about
an
hour
fairfield
returned
and
then
they
all
went
to
the
for
dinner
the
italian
couple
went
too
but
they
did
not
sit
at
a
table
near
the
fairfields
she
s
lovely
announced
patty
i
call
her
signora
orsini
because
i
feel
sure
she
descended
from
that
noble
in
that
case
it
would
be
her
husband
who
was
of
noble
descent
suggested
her
father
oh
yes
so
it
would
well
it
makes
no
difference
they
re
orsinis
he
s
as
nice
as
she
is
only
he
seems
a
very
quiet
man
they
scarcely
talk
at
after
dinner
they
returned
to
the
compartment
in
the
other
car
and
found
the
orsinis
as
patty
called
them
already
there
the
place
had
been
lighted
up
and
presented
the
appearance
of
a
cosy
little
these
trains
are
most
pleasantly
arranged
said
fairfield
and
now
i
ll
leave
you
again
for
a
short
time
and
have
an
smoke
then
i
ll
come
back
and
before
we
know
it
the
evening
will
fly
by
and
we
ll
be
in
stay
as
long
as
you
like
said
patty
i
feel
as
if
i
had
lived
with
madame
orsini
all
my
life
and
i
have
a
feeling
she
s
fond
of
that
s
the
beauty
of
her
not
being
able
to
understand
you
teased
fairfield
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
oh
go
along
if
she
talk
to
me
and
understand
me
she
d
love
me
so
she
d
want
to
adopt
she
can
t
have
you
cried
fairfield
in
mock
alarm
don
t
come
to
so
much
of
an
understanding
as
that
no
i
won
t
i
m
not
ready
to
leave
you
yet
now
go
daddy
and
have
a
calm
pleasant
smoke
with
madame
orsini
bowed
and
smiled
and
wagged
her
head
protectingly
at
the
girls
as
fairfield
went
away
now
said
patty
i
just
must
see
where
we
are
at
i
have
a
fine
railroad
map
of
italy
and
i
m
going
to
investigate
she
spread
the
map
out
before
her
and
she
and
flo
traced
their
route
you
see
said
patty
here
s
florence
we
left
that
and
followed
this
mark
to
pistoja
i
remember
we
passed
through
there
while
we
were
at
dinner
it
s
too
dark
now
to
see
the
names
of
the
places
but
bologna
is
the
next
stop
and
from
there
we
go
straight
along
this
line
to
venice
oh
here
we
are
at
the
train
stopped
and
waited
quite
a
time
in
the
station
patty
and
flo
were
greatly
interested
in
looking
from
their
windows
at
the
bustling
crowd
on
the
platform
it
was
brightly
lighted
and
travellers
were
hurrying
about
jostled
now
and
then
by
vendors
with
trays
or
stop
that
boy
cried
patty
let
s
buy
some
they
called
the
boy
who
came
to
the
train
window
and
sold
them
great
bunches
of
delicious
grapes
which
patty
laid
aside
for
an
evening
repast
why
do
they
stay
here
so
long
asked
flo
i
don
t
know
replied
patty
unless
they
are
taking
on
a
load
of
sausages
isn
t
this
the
place
where
they
make
bologna
sausages
no
you
goose
of
course
it
isn
oh
i
think
it
is
and
patty
turned
questioningly
to
the
italian
lady
bologna
sausages
she
said
with
an
inquiring
smile
bologna
si
returned
the
dame
but
sausages
she
could
not
understand
so
patty
gave
it
up
at
last
the
train
started
on
again
and
for
a
short
time
the
trip
was
uneventful
then
the
italian
gentleman
looked
at
his
watch
spoke
to
his
wife
and
rising
began
to
get
his
bags
and
coat
from
the
rack
why
they
re
going
to
get
out
exclaimed
patty
to
flo
so
they
are
said
flo
i
don
t
know
why
but
i
somehow
thought
they
were
going
all
the
way
through
to
venice
well
i
shall
always
remember
the
old
lady
s
pleasant
the
train
was
slowing
down
at
a
station
and
the
italians
shook
hands
with
the
girls
in
farewell
signor
said
the
old
lady
looking
at
patty
with
a
doubtful
expression
ritorno
oh
yes
said
patty
he
ll
return
si
si
signor
ritorno
it
was
not
entirely
intelligible
but
the
train
had
stopped
and
the
guard
had
flung
the
door
open
he
announced
some
official
information
which
was
as
so
much
greek
to
the
two
girls
then
with
a
final
nod
of
the
old
lady
clambered
down
the
steps
after
her
husband
and
the
guard
slammed
the
door
again
parma
said
flo
reading
the
name
on
the
station
sign
i
suppose
they
are
going
after
violets
don
t
you
patty
yes
probably
they
ll
pick
big
bunches
along
the
roadside
but
flo
we
ve
lost
our
chaperon
it
isn
t
at
all
the
thing
for
two
correct
young
ladies
to
be
all
alone
in
a
railroad
train
at
well
your
father
will
be
back
in
a
few
yes
of
course
he
will
i
m
not
a
bit
afraid
but
i
know
daddy
won
t
like
it
still
it
s
his
own
fault
we
couldn
t
help
it
if
our
friend
get
out
to
pick
parma
course
we
couldn
t
said
flo
chapter
xvi
an
exciting
adventure
another
half
hour
went
by
and
patty
looking
at
her
watch
said
why
it
s
after
nine
o
clock
we
will
now
eat
our
grapes
i
meant
to
offer
some
to
that
dear
old
lady
but
she
preferred
violets
so
i
had
no
the
girls
ate
the
grapes
and
though
they
didn
t
refer
to
it
each
secretly
wished
fairfield
would
come
back
it
does
seem
queer
said
patty
at
last
for
father
to
stay
so
long
away
but
of
course
he
thinks
the
orsinis
are
still
with
us
and
if
they
were
i
wouldn
t
give
a
thought
to
father
s
long
he
s
probably
fallen
asleep
said
flo
of
course
he
has
that
s
just
it
his
dinner
and
his
smoke
made
him
sleepy
and
he
dropped
off
before
he
knew
it
well
if
he
doesn
t
wake
up
before
he
ll
have
to
come
and
get
us
when
we
get
to
maybe
he
ll
sleep
right
well
when
we
get
to
venice
i
ll
get
out
then
and
hunt
up
the
royal
danieli
men
and
they
ll
find
how
capable
you
americans
are
i
don
t
mind
confessing
that
i
m
a
bit
pshaw
what
is
there
to
be
scared
at
we
re
as
safe
here
as
we
can
be
nothing
can
harm
us
the
guards
would
look
after
us
if
there
were
any
danger
but
there
isn
t
no
i
suppose
not
flo
agreed
but
she
spoke
hesitatingly
as
for
patty
she
was
not
really
alarmed
but
she
couldn
t
helping
wishing
her
father
would
come
back
it
would
be
all
well
enough
in
america
or
even
in
england
but
alone
on
an
italian
railway
where
she
couldn
t
make
herself
understood
and
in
a
country
where
young
ladies
are
allowed
little
or
no
unconventionality
she
had
secret
misgivings
but
it
would
never
do
to
let
flo
know
she
was
troubled
so
she
said
gaily
well
if
daddy
can
have
a
nice
long
nap
so
can
i
come
let
s
fold
up
our
coats
for
pillows
and
drop
asleep
oh
no
patty
it
might
be
pooh
it
s
no
more
dangerous
asleep
than
awake
i
m
going
to
try
it
patty
made
flo
comfortable
first
she
opened
her
dressing
case
and
taking
out
the
cologne
water
bathed
flo
s
temples
refreshingly
then
she
folded
her
coat
and
tucked
it
beneath
her
head
and
said
quietly
you
needn
t
sleep
dear
if
you
don
t
want
to
but
you
ll
rest
better
that
flo
gave
her
a
grateful
smile
and
closed
her
eyes
in
order
to
rest
them
she
was
tired
with
the
exertions
of
the
day
and
the
long
railway
journey
and
patty
was
not
surprised
when
after
a
very
few
moments
she
saw
that
flo
was
without
doubt
fast
asleep
as
for
patty
fairfield
she
had
no
intention
of
going
to
sleep
and
couldn
t
have
done
so
anyway
she
felt
the
responsibility
of
the
situation
for
snippy
had
left
flo
in
fairfield
s
charge
and
in
his
absence
loyal
patty
felt
herself
his
representative
she
sat
upright
staring
out
of
the
window
into
the
darkness
or
watching
the
doorway
where
she
expected
every
moment
to
see
her
father
enter
bereft
of
even
flo
s
chatter
she
grew
more
and
more
lonely
and
only
as
the
hands
of
her
watch
neared
ten
o
clock
did
she
begin
to
brighten
up
on
the
knowledge
that
they
must
now
soon
reach
venice
but
these
trains
are
always
late
she
thought
so
i
shan
t
hope
to
get
there
before
and
then
the
time
dragged
along
slowly
ten
came
and
no
sign
of
her
father
she
had
drawn
the
window
curtain
but
she
pushed
it
aside
hoping
to
see
the
lights
of
venice
only
a
rushing
darkness
greeted
her
eyes
she
looked
at
flo
it
seemed
a
pity
to
wake
her
and
yet
patty
felt
she
couldn
t
endure
this
loneliness
and
suspense
much
longer
she
knew
the
train
should
get
in
at
ten
and
surely
a
half
hour
was
enough
to
allow
for
the
usual
tardiness
but
on
went
the
hands
of
her
little
watch
and
as
it
neared
eleven
patty
couldn
t
stand
it
any
longer
flo
she
said
gently
touching
the
sleeping
girl
flo
flo
moved
uneasily
opened
her
eyes
closed
them
again
and
was
as
sound
asleep
as
ever
well
i
ll
let
her
be
thought
patty
unselfishly
she
couldn
t
help
any
and
i
don
t
know
that
there
s
anything
to
be
helped
i
suppose
there
s
nothing
wrong
what
could
be
father
s
asleep
in
the
and
flo
s
asleep
here
so
i
may
as
well
sit
patiently
till
we
reach
venice
and
then
they
ll
have
to
wake
up
whether
they
want
to
or
a
guard
came
through
the
corridor
and
looked
in
at
the
compartment
door
he
said
something
in
italian
which
patty
couldn
t
understand
but
she
showed
him
her
watch
and
said
venice
stazione
when
she
pointed
to
the
hands
and
partly
comprehending
the
guard
took
out
his
own
watch
and
indicated
that
they
would
reach
the
station
at
quarter
to
twelve
train
late
said
patty
smiling
and
still
partly
understanding
the
guard
said
si
signorina
bowed
and
went
away
a
little
cheered
at
having
had
some
one
to
speak
to
even
if
for
a
most
unsatisfactory
conversation
patty
sat
down
again
to
wait
her
heart
was
quite
light
now
for
it
was
nearly
time
to
reach
venice
and
then
all
would
be
well
at
eleven
she
wakened
flo
get
up
girlie
she
cried
we
re
almost
to
venice
and
you
must
tidy
your
hair
and
put
your
hat
flo
sat
up
wide
awake
all
at
once
where
s
your
father
she
said
he
hasn
t
come
back
said
patty
feeling
somehow
guilty
under
flo
s
accusing
glance
but
determined
to
stand
up
for
her
father
he
must
have
fallen
asleep
just
as
you
did
i
tried
twice
to
wake
you
but
you
slept
like
a
and
you
ve
been
all
alone
oh
patty
i
m
so
sorry
do
forgive
me
not
at
all
you
sleepy
child
it
s
all
right
i
see
lights
outside
already
here
put
on
your
flo
rose
and
yawned
as
she
took
her
hat
from
patty
they
furbished
up
their
toilets
a
bit
and
soon
were
all
ready
to
leave
the
train
patty
pushed
the
curtain
up
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
the
lights
are
growing
thicker
now
she
said
we
re
almost
in
i
should
think
the
porter
would
wake
father
up
by
this
time
well
i
m
very
sure
nothing
has
happened
to
patty
s
decided
statement
gave
flo
a
clue
that
patty
secretly
afraid
something
happened
to
her
father
and
as
flo
had
had
such
a
fear
all
the
time
she
too
stoutly
denied
it
of
course
not
nothing
could
happen
to
him
he
s
just
asleep
as
i
was
i
don
t
see
how
you
got
me
awake
at
all
snippy
has
to
throw
cold
water
in
my
face
to
do
the
train
drew
into
the
great
station
there
were
many
lights
but
not
many
people
about
which
was
doubtless
because
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
the
guard
threw
open
the
door
of
their
compartment
and
the
two
girls
got
out
patty
thought
the
guard
looked
at
them
a
little
curiously
and
supposing
he
was
desirous
of
a
fee
she
gave
him
some
coins
he
bowed
and
still
hovered
near
them
where
is
the
asked
patty
but
the
guard
knew
not
the
strange
word
and
only
shook
his
head
flo
said
patty
looking
about
we
d
better
stand
right
here
when
father
gets
out
of
his
car
he
ll
come
here
for
us
but
didn
t
you
think
venice
had
water
streets
these
are
ordinary
roads
and
i
see
lots
of
omnibuses
but
no
i
suppose
the
water
streets
are
only
in
the
main
part
of
the
city
said
flo
it
does
seem
to
be
solid
land
all
around
the
station
i
can
t
see
any
water
well
there
must
be
some
somewhere
flo
where
you
suppose
father
is
i
don
t
know
patty
and
and
i
m
awfully
well
you
just
stop
being
frightened
i
tell
you
everything
is
all
right
or
will
be
in
a
the
crowd
was
moving
along
toward
the
entrance
to
the
station
through
which
all
the
incoming
passengers
must
go
and
patty
reluctantly
said
we
d
better
go
on
into
the
station
flo
we
can
t
stand
here
and
father
will
surely
find
us
there
if
if
patty
nearly
broke
down
for
a
sudden
conviction
had
come
to
her
that
something
serious
have
happened
to
keep
fairfield
from
them
now
the
two
girls
with
their
light
luggage
still
in
their
hands
followed
the
crowd
through
the
ticket
gate
biglietti
said
the
ticket
man
i
haven
t
any
said
patty
and
without
waiting
to
hear
the
man
s
surprised
protest
patty
pushed
flo
ahead
of
her
and
they
went
on
into
the
of
the
station
something
has
happened
flo
she
said
something
awful
perhaps
but
i
can
t
imagine
what
it
is
now
we
re
alone
and
unprotected
in
a
strange
land
and
it
s
up
to
us
to
be
brave
and
sensible
i
shall
take
the
gondola
or
omnibus
or
whatever
goes
to
the
royal
danieli
hotel
and
go
right
straight
there
then
we
can
get
somebody
to
look
for
father
but
two
young
girls
can
do
nothing
and
we
d
only
waste
you
re
splendid
patty
said
flo
who
was
struggling
hard
to
keep
from
crying
i
m
no
good
at
all
but
i
ll
do
just
as
you
they
went
on
to
the
platform
where
a
dozen
or
more
omnibuses
stood
waiting
with
their
doors
hospitably
open
names
of
hotels
were
in
gilded
letters
over
the
doors
but
patty
could
not
see
the
one
she
sought
but
at
last
she
discovered
an
official
who
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
station
agent
or
and
he
had
such
a
kindly
intelligent
face
that
she
addressed
him
do
you
speak
english
she
said
yes
miss
a
little
he
replied
looking
at
her
with
a
questioning
expression
then
please
tell
me
where
is
the
royal
danieli
hotel
it
is
in
venice
oh
yes
of
course
i
know
it
is
in
venice
but
i
mean
where
is
its
omnibus
how
can
i
get
to
it
to
get
to
it
you
must
go
to
venice
ma
but
i
am
in
venice
no
ma
am
you
are
in
what
cried
patty
aghast
at
his
words
this
is
milan
ma
are
you
are
you
quite
sure
even
in
her
bewildered
horror
patty
realised
the
ludicrousness
of
this
question
perceive
the
signboard
ma
the
man
pointed
to
sign
which
unmistakably
announced
milano
flo
said
patty
in
a
scared
little
voice
i
don
t
know
what
it
means
but
it
seems
we
are
in
milan
instead
of
in
oh
patty
gasped
flo
as
she
clung
desperately
to
patty
s
arm
what
shall
we
do
i
don
t
know
said
patty
slowly
it
s
a
pretty
serious
thing
for
two
girls
to
be
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
a
strange
italian
city
but
i
took
the
train
for
venice
said
patty
to
the
man
and
her
tone
had
in
it
a
faint
tinge
of
accusation
though
of
course
the
man
was
in
no
way
responsible
so
ma
am
he
replied
and
in
an
instant
patty
saw
that
he
did
not
believe
her
statements
and
that
he
was
covertly
laughing
at
them
come
away
flo
she
said
sternly
and
marched
the
now
weeping
girl
into
the
station
again
listen
flo
said
patty
her
face
assuming
a
very
grave
look
we
are
in
an
awful
predicament
perhaps
more
awful
than
we
know
ourselves
we
are
in
milan
there
s
no
doubt
of
that
that
s
why
we
didn
t
see
any
water
or
gondolas
where
father
is
i
ve
no
idea
of
course
there
was
some
mistake
about
the
train
he
may
be
gone
on
to
venice
though
i
don
t
see
how
he
could
have
done
that
without
us
or
he
may
be
in
some
other
city
at
any
rate
he
s
quite
as
anxious
about
us
as
we
can
possibly
be
about
ourselves
now
i
don
t
know
what
s
going
to
happen
to
us
but
i
m
going
to
do
the
very
best
i
can
to
prove
that
an
american
girl
can
take
care
of
herself
in
an
emergency
we
won
t
speak
to
that
man
out
there
again
he
s
horrid
and
he
doesn
t
believe
what
we
say
the
ticket
office
is
closed
there
s
no
one
reliable
around
but
the
drivers
of
those
omnibuses
i
shall
appeal
to
why
don
t
you
speak
to
some
of
the
travellers
asked
flo
oh
you
never
can
judge
about
them
and
they
re
mostly
italians
anyway
have
you
any
money
no
only
a
little
change
snippy
carries
the
well
i
ve
not
very
much
but
i
think
i
ve
enough
now
come
with
me
stand
by
me
and
don
t
act
one
bit
frightened
that
s
all
you
can
do
to
help
so
it
when
patty
was
face
to
face
with
a
serious
emergency
it
always
made
her
curt
of
speech
and
her
stern
manner
made
flo
recover
herself
at
once
so
that
it
was
two
very
young
women
who
approached
the
drivers
who
whip
in
hand
stood
lined
up
along
the
platform
although
they
sometimes
seemed
eager
to
attract
passengers
none
of
them
asked
the
girls
to
get
into
their
vehicles
and
patty
went
along
until
she
came
to
one
whose
face
she
liked
do
you
speak
english
she
asked
as
she
looked
at
him
coldly
yes
which
is
the
largest
and
best
hotel
in
milan
near
the
station
the
driver
pointed
to
a
large
hotel
just
across
the
road
scarcely
a
stone
s
throw
from
the
station
itself
the
palace
hotel
madame
he
said
respectfully
where
is
its
omnibus
there
madame
and
he
pointed
to
a
vehicle
standing
near
get
in
flo
said
patty
briefly
thank
you
she
added
turning
to
bestow
a
coin
on
the
man
to
the
hotel
she
then
directed
as
she
got
into
the
omnibus
and
seated
herself
beside
flo
oh
patty
said
flo
trembling
as
she
grasped
patty
s
hand
they
were
all
alone
in
the
omnibus
and
in
two
minutes
it
was
entering
the
driveway
of
the
hotel
be
careful
now
said
patty
still
sternly
we
re
not
out
of
the
woods
yet
and
if
you
cry
or
look
distressed
you
ll
spoil
all
i
m
trying
to
do
and
i
ll
not
answer
for
the
consequences
now
brace
up
flo
braced
up
and
as
they
alighted
from
the
omnibus
patty
motioned
for
the
porter
to
bring
the
bags
and
wraps
she
went
directly
to
the
desk
where
the
night
attendant
was
you
speak
english
of
course
she
said
yes
we
have
had
an
accident
a
misfortune
my
friend
and
myself
must
stay
here
i
wish
to
engage
three
communicating
rooms
and
i
wish
also
the
services
of
a
maid
i
prefer
an
elderly
woman
who
will
remain
with
us
through
the
night
and
will
occupy
the
third
yes
the
man
looked
astonished
but
patty
s
quiet
dignity
and
flo
s
impassive
english
stolidity
gave
them
an
air
of
authority
which
he
was
disinclined
to
ignore
our
large
luggage
was
left
on
the
train
owing
to
the
accident
went
on
patty
i
will
pay
you
fifty
francs
in
advance
and
will
settle
the
rest
of
the
bill
for
the
present
it
is
imperative
that
we
go
to
our
rooms
at
yes
mademoiselle
repeated
the
bewildered
man
he
was
accustomed
to
american
guests
but
this
was
a
new
type
he
rang
a
bell
he
despatched
one
or
two
messengers
he
called
a
porter
and
in
a
few
moments
patty
saw
her
bag
and
cloak
carried
by
the
elevator
door
thrown
open
and
a
matronly
woman
coming
toward
them
this
is
ponderby
mademoiselle
she
is
one
of
our
but
she
is
english
and
most
trusty
and
capable
so
i
offer
you
her
patty
almost
fell
into
the
arms
of
the
woman
she
was
so
glad
to
see
her
but
she
only
shook
hands
and
said
i
am
glad
to
have
your
services
ponderby
come
let
us
go
chapter
xvii
the
other
side
of
the
story
when
they
were
safely
in
their
rooms
behind
locked
doors
flo
threw
herself
into
ponderby
s
motherly
arms
and
wept
as
hard
as
she
could
which
was
really
pretty
hard
patty
stood
by
looking
at
her
it
had
been
a
nerve
strain
for
patty
and
now
the
reaction
was
coming
on
her
lip
quivered
and
she
said
it
isn
t
fair
of
you
flo
to
take
up
all
ponderby
i
m
worse
off
than
you
are
for
i
don
t
know
but
what
my
father
is
killed
in
some
awful
railroad
he
t
be
said
flo
sobbing
still
there
t
have
been
a
on
that
train
unless
we
had
known
it
well
i
don
t
know
where
father
is
anyhow
and
he
doesn
t
know
where
i
am
then
patty
burst
into
real
sobs
and
the
englishwoman
was
at
her
wits
end
to
know
what
to
do
with
these
two
strange
midnight
visitors
but
she
rose
nobly
to
the
occasion
there
there
my
lambs
she
said
soothingly
you
can
tell
me
all
about
it
presently
but
first
let
us
get
comfortable
take
off
your
dusty
travelling
frocks
and
have
you
any
no
said
patty
only
just
our
night
things
i
ve
only
my
furnished
toilet
bag
and
flo
hasn
t
even
never
mind
dearie
we
ll
improvise
dressing
jackets
out
of
these
big
bath
towels
now
shall
i
ring
the
bell
and
order
a
bite
of
supper
a
sandwich
now
and
a
cup
of
coffee
not
coffee
said
flo
rousing
herself
a
bit
it
keeps
me
awake
let
s
have
yes
said
patty
hot
chocolate
and
chicken
and
put
in
sobbing
flo
and
jam
said
patty
almost
smiling
now
yes
yes
assorted
sandwiches
and
nice
hot
ponderby
rang
the
bell
and
gave
the
order
and
by
the
time
the
tray
was
brought
she
had
helped
the
girls
to
bathe
their
faces
and
had
deftly
pinned
huge
bath
towels
round
their
shoulders
in
a
very
good
imitation
of
and
not
until
they
were
sipping
their
second
cups
of
cocoa
and
had
made
way
with
a
goodly
number
of
the
little
sandwiches
did
she
say
now
tell
me
all
about
patty
told
the
whole
story
of
their
trip
from
florence
and
how
her
father
had
left
them
to
go
to
the
for
half
an
hour
and
they
had
not
seen
him
again
do
you
suppose
brigands
attacked
him
asked
patty
her
eyes
wide
open
with
fear
and
wonder
no
dearie
not
that
but
it
s
a
strange
story
you
tell
and
i
can
think
of
only
one
explanation
rest
here
and
don
t
think
about
it
for
five
minutes
till
i
ponderby
hurried
away
and
was
back
again
in
less
than
five
minutes
it
s
as
i
thought
she
said
that
train
you
took
from
florence
is
really
in
two
sections
that
is
half
of
its
cars
are
for
venice
and
half
for
milan
at
bologna
the
train
is
divided
and
sent
in
two
directions
you
see
bologna
is
the
southern
point
of
a
triangle
from
there
one
travels
northeast
to
venice
or
northwest
to
milan
those
two
cities
form
the
other
two
points
of
the
triangle
so
when
the
train
was
divided
at
bologna
some
cars
including
the
one
your
father
was
in
went
on
to
venice
while
other
cars
including
the
one
you
were
in
branched
off
to
milan
and
here
you
patty
cogitated
on
this
then
she
said
when
father
tried
to
return
to
our
car
our
car
wasn
t
exactly
it
had
already
been
detached
and
sent
to
could
father
find
this
out
oh
yes
from
the
train
guard
but
he
should
have
taken
his
seats
in
a
car
for
venice
in
the
first
we
were
put
in
our
places
by
the
man
from
the
hotel
in
florence
declared
patty
so
it
wasn
t
father
s
fault
at
then
you
should
all
have
changed
cars
at
bologna
and
taken
seats
in
a
venice
yes
agreed
patty
that
s
where
the
mistake
occurred
and
all
because
neither
father
nor
i
understand
italian
i
daresay
the
guard
announced
that
he
was
shouting
all
sorts
of
directions
but
of
course
i
didn
t
understand
him
and
father
didn
t
either
and
too
i
daresay
father
was
asleep
you
know
we
all
thought
we
were
going
directly
through
to
venice
so
we
spent
the
evening
as
pleasantly
as
we
could
never
dreaming
we
had
to
change
cars
or
yes
that
explains
it
all
miss
fairfield
and
you
have
proved
yourself
a
most
sensible
and
capable
young
woman
to
manage
as
well
as
you
have
done
an
italian
city
is
no
place
for
two
girls
i
know
it
ponderby
don
t
think
i
didn
t
realise
the
seriousness
of
it
all
but
i
did
the
best
i
could
you
know
i
am
an
patty
said
this
so
proudly
that
the
englishwoman
gave
her
a
look
of
admiration
true
she
said
an
english
girl
might
not
have
been
so
no
i
wasn
t
confessed
flo
i
depended
on
patty
for
i
knew
she
could
take
care
of
things
if
anybody
but
said
patty
suddenly
think
of
father
when
he
tried
to
return
to
us
and
couldn
t
find
us
what
you
suppose
he
did
he
couldn
t
do
anything
said
ponderby
except
to
find
out
that
you
had
gone
on
to
he
couldn
t
find
that
out
said
patty
slowly
unless
he
found
some
one
who
could
explain
it
to
him
in
english
you
see
it
s
quite
complicated
with
the
divided
train
and
all
and
besides
father
was
nearly
frantic
with
worry
about
yes
he
must
have
been
said
ponderby
gravely
but
he
could
do
nothing
at
all
except
to
go
on
to
venice
he
s
there
now
of
course
shall
you
not
telegraph
him
that
you
are
safe
indeed
i
will
cried
patty
bless
you
for
suggesting
it
i
seem
to
have
lost
my
wits
oh
flo
what
snippy
say
when
father
gets
there
without
us
she
ll
be
in
an
awful
way
said
flo
and
nan
will
be
most
crazy
oh
patty
they
re
really
having
a
worse
time
of
it
than
we
are
now
just
think
they
don
t
know
where
we
are
even
yes
said
patty
thinking
father
must
know
we
came
on
to
no
he
doesn
t
he
may
think
we
got
off
at
some
other
station
you
know
the
train
stopped
three
or
four
times
or
he
may
think
we
got
off
at
bologna
and
staid
that
s
so
agreed
patty
well
he
knows
me
well
enough
to
know
that
i
ll
do
the
best
i
can
and
i
do
believe
flo
that
he
feels
it
a
worse
responsibility
to
have
lost
you
than
me
if
he
doesn
t
it
won
t
be
snip
s
fault
said
flo
grimly
she
ll
give
him
a
waxing
i
ll
it
wasn
t
father
s
fault
said
patty
staunchly
that
hotel
man
ought
to
have
told
us
to
change
cars
at
bologna
nice
railroad
management
well
i
ll
telegraph
at
once
for
he
can
t
very
well
telegraph
to
us
when
he
doesn
t
know
where
we
ponderby
brought
blanks
and
patty
wrote
a
long
telegram
we
are
nicely
fixed
at
the
palace
hotel
with
comfortable
rooms
and
a
dear
english
duenna
send
snippy
for
us
as
soon
as
possible
and
we
will
gladly
rejoin
you
patty
and
ponderby
bustled
away
to
send
the
telegram
and
then
returned
to
tuck
her
charges
into
bed
it
s
lucky
you
know
the
hotel
your
people
are
staying
at
in
venice
she
said
and
now
go
quietly
to
sleep
for
you
ve
done
all
you
can
but
i
doubt
me
if
your
poor
father
is
sleeping
or
snippy
said
flo
or
nan
said
patty
we
ve
got
to
do
the
sleeping
for
all
the
family
flo
so
let
s
get
about
knowing
she
had
done
all
she
could
in
the
matter
and
thoroughly
worn
out
with
the
journey
and
the
after
excitement
patty
turned
on
her
pillow
and
was
soon
sound
asleep
but
far
from
sleep
at
that
moment
was
fairfield
the
poor
man
was
passing
through
an
awful
experience
as
patty
had
surmised
he
had
dropped
asleep
in
the
but
he
had
dozed
only
for
a
few
moments
and
of
course
had
no
thought
other
than
that
his
two
young
charges
were
in
their
cosy
compartment
with
the
elderly
and
kind
italian
couple
then
soon
after
leaving
bologna
and
all
unsuspecting
that
the
train
had
been
divided
he
started
to
return
to
patty
and
flo
and
found
to
his
amazement
that
that
car
with
several
others
had
been
disconnected
at
bologna
fairfield
was
stunned
he
found
an
official
who
could
talk
fairly
good
english
and
laid
the
case
before
him
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
although
a
clever
and
resourceful
man
fairfield
felt
that
his
hands
were
tied
he
knew
patty
was
on
the
train
for
milan
but
he
could
not
guess
at
what
station
she
would
get
off
if
indeed
she
had
not
left
the
train
at
bologna
for
the
moment
his
anxiety
for
the
girls
safety
was
lost
in
an
endeavour
to
think
of
some
way
to
get
into
communication
with
them
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
getting
off
the
train
himself
and
yet
he
hated
to
go
on
to
venice
without
them
but
to
return
to
bologna
would
be
a
chase
and
too
there
was
no
train
back
for
several
hours
he
felt
sure
that
patty
would
be
brave
and
sensible
but
he
could
not
imagine
what
course
she
would
pursue
and
he
well
knew
that
real
dangers
beset
the
two
lonely
girls
so
he
wrote
telegrams
which
he
put
off
to
be
sent
at
the
next
station
he
sent
one
to
bologna
to
be
called
out
in
the
station
on
the
chance
of
patty
s
being
there
he
sent
duplicates
to
milan
and
to
every
intervening
station
at
which
the
train
stopped
he
felt
little
hope
that
any
of
these
would
really
reach
patty
but
he
could
think
of
no
other
plan
had
he
been
sure
she
would
go
through
to
milan
he
would
have
gone
directly
there
himself
but
so
few
and
inconvenient
were
the
trains
that
this
plan
was
dismissed
and
too
he
must
go
on
to
venice
where
nan
and
snippy
were
awaiting
them
an
awful
dread
of
snippy
s
reception
of
his
news
filled
fairfield
with
consternation
but
as
he
thought
since
his
own
daughter
was
lost
as
well
as
snippy
s
young
charge
his
own
grief
was
as
great
as
hers
and
try
as
he
would
to
rely
on
patty
s
bravery
and
capability
in
an
emergency
he
shuddered
to
think
of
those
two
girls
carried
swiftly
through
the
night
alone
unprotected
and
wondering
why
he
did
not
return
to
them
it
was
some
comfort
to
realise
that
the
kind
old
italian
pair
were
with
them
had
fairfield
known
that
they
left
the
train
at
parma
he
would
have
been
racked
with
a
worse
anxiety
but
he
hoped
that
wherever
they
all
were
the
quartette
were
together
and
his
faith
in
the
kindly
old
people
was
such
that
he
felt
sure
they
would
look
after
the
girls
some
way
so
he
arrived
in
venice
a
sad
crushed
man
and
stepped
into
the
beautiful
gondola
sent
to
meet
him
by
the
royal
danieli
hotel
without
a
glance
at
the
canals
the
bridges
the
buildings
and
the
lights
that
are
so
fascinating
to
the
newcomers
to
venice
with
his
head
bowed
in
his
hands
he
made
the
trip
to
the
hotel
and
went
in
to
find
nan
and
snippy
awaiting
him
in
the
reception
room
where
are
the
girls
cried
nan
gaily
as
she
greeted
her
husband
little
thinking
of
anything
more
serious
than
that
they
had
paused
outside
to
look
at
the
scene
or
something
like
that
have
you
our
own
rooms
all
right
said
fairfield
abruptly
yes
fred
said
nan
wondering
at
his
manner
then
let
us
go
to
them
at
once
he
said
and
so
grave
was
his
face
that
without
another
word
nan
led
the
way
and
the
three
went
up
the
magnificent
ducal
staircase
to
their
rooms
on
the
next
floor
here
in
a
few
frank
statements
fairfield
told
his
story
as
he
concluded
snippy
s
eyes
flashed
fire
and
she
glared
at
him
you
have
lost
miss
flo
she
exclaimed
i
trusted
her
to
your
care
mrs
postlethwaite
said
fairfield
and
the
fact
of
his
using
her
name
made
snippy
pause
to
listen
when
my
own
daughter
is
also
lost
you
can
not
fairly
say
i
betrayed
a
trust
i
admit
my
culpability
in
the
matter
but
i
think
in
this
very
grave
emergency
we
must
all
do
what
we
can
to
find
the
girls
and
not
give
way
to
useless
i
think
so
too
said
nan
taking
her
husband
s
hand
and
postlethwaite
while
i
sympathise
with
you
regarding
flo
you
must
also
realise
what
we
are
suffering
regarding
patty
and
though
you
are
flo
s
guardian
and
governess
yet
patty
is
our
snippy
s
sense
of
justice
came
to
her
rescue
and
she
said
more
quietly
forgive
me
fairfield
i
was
so
shocked
and
upset
at
miss
flo
s
disappearance
i
quite
overlooked
miss
patty
i
won
t
admit
that
you
are
in
a
worse
case
than
i
for
i
am
responsible
to
miss
flo
s
mother
while
miss
patty
is
your
own
child
but
i
appreciate
the
situation
and
we
will
work
together
to
do
all
we
can
to
get
the
children
back
as
soon
as
that
s
the
sensible
snippy
that
you
are
said
fairfield
as
he
heartily
clasped
her
hand
but
alas
i
can
not
think
of
anything
to
do
it
doesn
t
seem
right
to
refer
the
case
to
the
police
as
i
can
t
help
thinking
the
girls
are
safe
somewhere
with
the
italian
lady
and
gentleman
and
if
i
know
my
patty
she
ll
telegraph
me
as
soon
as
she
can
thank
heaven
she
knows
our
venice
address
hard
as
it
is
i
think
the
only
thing
we
can
do
now
is
to
wait
until
the
others
agreed
to
this
and
so
they
all
went
to
bed
though
not
to
sleep
chapter
xviii
venice
at
last
very
early
the
next
morning
snippy
who
had
fallen
into
a
light
doze
was
awakened
by
a
tapping
at
her
door
hastily
flinging
on
her
she
opened
the
door
to
see
fairfield
standing
there
with
a
smiling
face
that
betokened
good
news
he
waved
a
telegram
at
her
and
exclaimed
the
girls
are
all
right
snippy
we
may
congratulate
each
other
thank
heaven
cried
the
delighted
woman
and
then
her
eyes
eagerly
devoured
the
telegram
patty
had
sent
bless
her
heart
she
said
she
s
a
good
girl
is
miss
patty
fairfield
and
to
think
of
those
two
dear
children
alone
in
milan
how
soon
can
i
start
fairfield
smiled
at
her
ready
acceptance
of
patty
s
suggestion
and
replied
you
must
get
your
breakfast
first
the
girls
are
all
right
now
you
know
i
ve
telegraphed
them
that
we
ve
received
their
message
and
will
send
for
them
you
can
reach
them
by
noon
i
think
and
have
them
back
here
before
sunset
i
ll
go
for
them
if
you
but
snippy
declared
herself
quite
willing
to
go
so
after
an
early
breakfast
she
set
out
for
milan
accustomed
to
travelling
she
did
not
mind
the
journey
at
all
and
in
her
gladness
at
flo
s
safety
she
was
once
again
her
own
staid
sensible
self
she
reached
the
hotel
duly
paid
the
bills
the
girls
had
incurred
gave
ponderby
a
generous
gift
from
fairfield
and
many
earnest
thanks
from
them
all
it
s
so
nice
that
you
can
t
scold
me
snippy
remarked
flo
after
they
were
in
the
train
for
venice
somehow
i
think
you
d
like
to
scold
somebody
and
you
know
that
i
wasn
t
a
bit
to
blame
you
daren
t
scold
fairfield
patty
deserves
only
praise
so
poor
thing
you
ve
nobody
to
berate
have
you
i
blame
myself
miss
flo
said
snippy
primly
that
i
ever
let
you
out
of
my
oh
well
snips
all
s
well
that
ends
well
and
we
ll
have
a
booful
time
in
flo
never
took
snippy
very
seriously
so
the
two
girls
gave
themselves
up
to
enjoyment
of
their
journey
and
looked
forward
eagerly
to
their
arrival
in
venice
at
last
patty
sprang
from
the
train
straight
into
her
father
s
arms
and
the
welcoming
kiss
he
gave
her
told
her
how
glad
he
was
to
have
her
safely
beside
him
once
more
and
now
said
nan
after
they
had
all
welcomed
each
other
we
ve
just
time
for
a
leisurely
water
trip
back
to
the
hotel
this
is
our
gondola
the
flowers
are
in
honour
of
your
nan
pointed
to
a
graceful
craft
which
was
waiting
for
them
it
was
a
gondola
and
its
black
sides
and
shining
metal
made
it
quite
distinct
from
the
more
dingy
affairs
all
around
also
the
gondolier
wore
a
resplendent
sash
of
bright
colours
and
his
handsome
italian
face
was
and
smiling
it
s
ours
said
nan
proudly
i
mean
while
we
re
here
i
picked
it
out
yesterday
and
it
s
the
finest
gondola
in
all
venice
eh
donatello
the
gondolier
showed
his
white
teeth
in
an
assenting
grin
though
he
scarcely
understood
the
question
it
s
angelic
declared
patty
as
she
stepped
in
and
the
lovely
dry
carpet
i
thought
of
course
the
bottom
of
a
gondola
was
of
a
wet
and
sloppy
you
goose
cried
nan
but
sit
down
patty
and
drink
it
all
what
the
canal
cried
patty
but
she
sat
down
and
looked
about
her
with
that
awed
thrill
that
the
first
sight
of
venice
brings
to
all
good
americans
it
was
not
far
from
the
sunset
hour
and
the
cabin
of
the
gondola
had
been
removed
so
they
could
see
the
gay
scenes
all
about
it
s
perfect
said
patty
as
she
gazed
delightedly
at
sea
and
sky
and
buildings
it
s
all
my
fancy
painted
it
only
i
didn
t
think
it
would
be
a
bit
like
this
i
did
said
flo
it
s
exactly
like
the
postcards
of
it
only
so
it
is
said
nan
i
recognised
that
myself
and
the
more
you
see
of
it
the
more
you
ll
love
then
they
came
to
the
rialto
bridge
and
patty
wanted
to
get
out
and
walk
across
it
but
her
father
said
there
wasn
t
time
then
she
must
wait
till
the
next
day
so
she
and
flo
just
sat
still
and
drifted
calmly
along
both
feeling
that
the
scene
was
too
lovely
even
for
words
of
appreciation
on
they
swept
round
the
great
curves
of
the
grand
canal
and
now
and
then
the
gondolier
sang
out
the
name
of
a
house
or
a
church
they
were
passing
he
s
worse
than
an
elevated
road
conductor
said
patty
i
can
t
make
out
a
word
he
says
but
then
i
don
t
want
to
i
don
t
care
which
church
is
which
and
if
the
borgias
had
lived
in
browning
s
house
i
should
make
no
well
here
s
the
piazzetta
said
her
father
you
must
learn
this
as
you
ll
spend
a
lot
of
time
here
it
leads
to
the
piazza
of
mark
and
is
the
meeting
place
of
all
then
i
suppose
you
ll
call
mark
s
the
said
patty
it
sounds
provincial
to
don
t
be
disrespectful
said
her
father
before
two
days
have
passed
you
ll
be
everlastingly
making
tracks
for
the
not
i
said
patty
i
expect
to
live
in
a
gondola
can
t
i
have
one
all
to
myself
father
just
for
flo
and
me
i
mean
you
and
nan
will
be
always
wanting
this
we
ll
get
another
if
you
like
girlie
but
i
won
t
let
you
and
flo
go
alone
in
it
snippy
and
i
are
to
accompany
you
always
hereafter
why
first
thing
you
knew
you
d
be
back
in
milan
but
here
we
are
at
our
the
gondola
turned
softly
round
into
a
side
canal
which
led
past
the
steps
of
the
hotel
royal
danieli
and
they
all
stepped
out
patty
soon
learned
the
knack
of
gracefully
balancing
herself
as
she
disembarked
but
flo
was
nervously
uncertain
of
her
steps
i
don
t
like
the
wabbly
things
she
exclaimed
as
she
almost
slipped
upon
the
wet
lower
step
of
the
hotel
entrance
oh
said
nan
you
ll
get
used
to
bobbling
around
in
a
day
or
two
they
re
really
lots
easier
to
get
into
than
your
london
indeed
they
are
said
patty
i
love
em
i
m
going
to
try
to
have
water
introduced
into
the
new
york
streets
it
s
the
nicest
sort
of
then
they
all
went
into
the
beautiful
hotel
which
used
to
be
the
palace
of
a
great
italian
family
the
elaborate
architecture
and
decorations
and
many
of
the
magnificent
pieces
of
furniture
were
still
there
and
the
grand
staircase
with
lights
and
palms
and
flowers
was
an
impressive
sight
well
said
patty
this
makes
the
grandeur
that
was
rome
look
like
three
united
states
dimes
oh
patty
cried
nan
how
can
you
use
slang
in
venice
but
the
allusion
was
lost
on
flo
and
snippy
who
knew
little
of
american
jests
their
rooms
looked
out
on
the
grand
canal
and
there
was
a
wide
board
sidewalk
between
the
hotel
and
the
water
this
was
crowded
with
people
promenading
up
and
down
both
italians
and
foreigners
well
said
patty
to
flo
through
the
open
door
of
their
adjoining
rooms
will
you
look
at
that
if
it
isn
t
like
the
board
walk
at
atlantic
city
flo
had
never
seen
atlantic
city
but
she
too
was
fascinated
by
the
brilliant
pageant
and
the
two
girls
sat
in
the
window
gazing
out
quite
forgetting
that
they
had
been
told
to
change
their
frocks
for
dinner
nan
came
in
trailing
her
pretty
white
draperies
why
girls
haven
t
you
begun
to
dress
she
said
you
must
hurry
we
want
to
dine
and
then

venicing
by
ooh

patty

won
t
you
ducky
stepmother
o
mine

said
nan
laughing
as
patty
shook
down
her
sunny
tangle
of
curls
and
then
shook
it
up
again
and
twisted
a
white
ribbon
through
it
what
shall
i
wear
nan
open
my
trunk
and
get
out
anything

light
green

nan
as
patty
with
toilette
completed
stood
fair
and
sweet
for
inspection
you
always
do
wear
just
the
right
things
so
do
you
was
the
affectionate
reply
and
arm
in
arm
they
went
down
the
great
staircase
the
party
all
met
in
one
of
the
and
fairfield
surveyed
his
pretty
wife
and
daughter
with
the
pride
he
always
felt
in
their
charm
and
attractiveness
flo
too
looked
dainty
and
and
snippy
in
her
black
satin
was
a
perfect
model
of
an
english
duenna
come
on
said
nan
to
her
husband
let
us
go
in
to
wait
a
moment
said
fairfield
looking
at
his
watch
it
isn
t
quite
yes
it
is
daddy
said
patty
who
was
darting
about
in
her
excitement
now
looking
out
of
the
window
now
admiring
the
appointments
indoors
lots
of
people
have
gone
to
the
and
here
are
lots
more
to
go
said
her
father
triumphantly
as
three
smiling
young
men
resplendent
in
evening
clothes
made
a
simultaneous
and
sudden
appearance
why
you
blessed
boys
cried
patty
as
with
outstretched
hands
and
shining
eyes
she
greeted
peter
homer
floyd
austin
and
caddy
oram
rejoiced
at
being
reunited
to
their
friends
the
young
men
rolled
their
eyes
in
ecstasy
said
austin
and
as
he
nudged
the
others
they
all
three
struck
an
attitude
and
rolled
their
eyes
ridiculously
toward
the
ceiling
oh
i
m
so
to
see
you
exclaimed
patty
how
dear
of
you
to
come
while
we
re
here
isn
t
it
flo
yes
awfully
jolly
said
flo
who
was
glad
to
see
the
boys
but
could
not
be
so
spontaneous
of
manner
as
patty
now
we
ll
go
to
dinner
said
fairfield
and
then
it
came
out
that
he
had
known
the
three
young
men
were
in
venice
and
had
invited
them
to
dinner
that
night
as
a
surprise
to
patty
and
flo
it
was
a
merry
dinner
indeed
snippy
and
the
elder
fairfields
were
so
glad
to
have
the
girls
safely
with
them
again
that
they
were
fairly
beaming
with
joy
and
as
for
the
five
young
people
they
were
just
bubbling
over
with
the
merriment
of
youth
and
happiness
have
you
had
a
good
time
all
through
italy
asked
peter
homer
of
patty
oh
yes
indeed
it
has
been
the
pleasurablest
pleasure
trip
i
could
imagine
everything
has
gone
right
except
she
paused
suddenly
as
she
remembered
the
episode
of
the
night
before
but
she
resolved
not
to
bring
up
the
subject
then
so
she
went
on
saying
except
that
of
course
we
were
lonely
in
florence
without
you
three
and
the
other
wonderers
but
we
can
wonder
through
venice
together
and
oh
won
t
it
be
lovely
i
haven
t
seen
venice
at
all
yet
except
just
the
row
up
from
the
venice
is
heaven
and
water
said
peter
homer
and
austin
droned
out
having
made
a
pretty
good
epigram
he
waited
for
the
applause
due
he
ll
get
it
too
said
patty
softly
clapping
her
hands
venice
heaven
and
water
i
ve
already
noticed
it
and
should
have
said
it
myself
if
i
d
thought
of
never
mind
said
floyd
consolingly
you
can
say
it
to
the
next
bunch
of
people
you
meet
and
then
you
ll
get
some
nice
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
fairfield
invited
the
whole
party
to
go
for
a
moonlight
row
he
had
engaged
a
barca
which
is
larger
than
a
gondola
and
it
held
them
all
comfortably
as
they
glided
out
into
the
grand
canal
patty
fairly
held
her
breath
at
the
marvel
of
the
scene
the
moon
not
far
from
full
sent
ripples
along
the
surface
of
the
water
the
strange
and
wonderful
buildings
loomed
weirdly
against
the
sky
on
the
bridges
and
quays
were
sparkling
lights
and
merry
people
while
ever
and
again
other
silent
dark
gondolas
glided
swiftly
past
their
own
craft
oh
said
patty
oh
realising
the
beauty
of
the
whole
effect
even
floyd
austin
refrained
from
making
his
nonsensical
speeches
and
all
sat
silent
and
absorbed
as
the
gondoliers
plashed
their
oars
sing
patty
said
nan
at
last
yes
do
said
everybody
but
patty
said
no
that
would
be
out
of
the
picture
ask
the
gondoliers
to
no
said
peter
homer
quietly
you
sing
first
patty
and
then
we
ll
have
them
sing
a
i
d
do
anything
to
hear
them
sing
a
barcarole
what
is
it
it
sounds
like
something
to
patty
cried
flo
don
t
talk
of
eating
in
this
enchanted
place
well
i
won
t
said
patty
what
shall
i
sing
some
pretty
little
sentimental
thing
suggested
floyd
soft
and
low
you
i
don
t
know
much
sentimental
music
said
patty
but
i
ll
sing
so
as
the
boat
silently
sped
along
the
water
eluding
other
boats
here
and
there
guided
by
the
skilful
gondoliers
patty
s
sweet
voice
sang
softly
to
a
gentle
charming
air
secrets
away
and
away
from
the
busy
town
soft
on
the
sea
the
stars
shine
down
and
nobody
knows
of
the
stars
and
the
sea
but
mine
and
me
away
and
away
the
wind
breathes
low
the
branches
are
waving
to
and
fro
and
nobody
knows
of
the
wind
in
the
tree
but
mine
and
me
away
and
away
in
a
far
somewhere
the
roses
are
red
and
sweet
and
fair
and
nobody
knows
of
a
rose
that
may
be
but
mine
and
me
away
and
away
on
a
blue
lagoon
shines
softly
softly
the
silvery
moon
and
nobody
knows
of
the
wavelets
plea
but
mine
and
the
last
strains
rang
out
across
the
water
and
as
patty
s
voice
ceased
a
whispered
brava
was
heard
from
one
of
the
gondoliers
brava
indeed
said
peter
homer
thank
you
patty
for
a
great
pleasure
now
the
gondoliers
shall
sing
for
you
in
they
were
easily
induced
to
do
so
and
their
italian
songs
kept
time
to
the
rippling
dip
of
their
trained
touch
of
the
oar
i
m
in
the
seventh
heaven
murmured
patty
as
a
song
came
to
an
end
and
water
supplemented
caddy
don
t
forget
your
but
i
m
not
in
the
water
rejoined
patty
laughing
what
is
that
church
you
may
as
well
make
up
your
minds
to
tell
me
every
time
for
i
m
not
going
to
try
to
remember
i
don
t
think
one
ought
to
remember
anything
in
venice
but
just
drift
along
and
look
and
that
is
the
santa
maria
della
salute
said
her
father
indeed
said
patty
saucily
and
why
are
the
statues
around
its
dome
all
on
bicycles
they
re
not
patty
i
m
ashamed
of
you
well
they
look
as
if
they
are
don
t
they
caddy
exactly
but
they
are
bicycles
only
by
moonlight
in
broad
daylight
they
are
quite
different
i
ll
bring
you
and
show
they
rowed
around
in
desultory
fashion
enjoying
the
evening
now
and
then
waxing
merry
and
talking
nonsense
and
again
growing
pensive
as
the
moonlight
demanded
at
last
they
stopped
at
the
piazzetta
and
fairfield
took
the
party
to
the
piazza
for
ices
oh
cried
patty
as
she
saw
the
gay
scene
banners
flying
a
band
playing
lights
sparkling
people
walking
about
and
sitting
at
small
tables
oh
why
didn
t
we
come
here
sooner
moonlight
and
water
pale
beside
this
fairyland
oh
ooh
patty
almost
danced
about
in
glee
she
loved
gay
sound
and
sight
and
this
was
so
novel
and
so
brilliant
it
delighted
her
beyond
measure
there
there
child
said
her
father
calm
your
transports
remember
this
is
your
first
night
in
venice
you
must
learn
to
get
used
to
i
will
said
patty
rapturously
i
d
love
to
just
give
me
time
peter
homer
was
watching
her
with
an
intense
interest
in
her
naïve
enjoyment
you
are
seeing
italy
the
way
i
want
you
to
he
said
as
they
all
sat
down
at
the
little
tables
is
this
your
venice
asked
patty
glancing
about
at
the
crowds
yes
it
s
all
my
venice
i
mean
the
way
we
re
seeing
it
the
rapid
impressions
of
the
moonlight
and
water
followed
by
this
gay
and
lively
scene
venice
and
many
i
shall
show
you
other
sides
of
the
city
s
charm
until
you
can
mingle
all
your
memories
into
a
perfect
picture
of
the
you
are
so
good
to
me
said
patty
i
like
to
have
you
take
such
an
interest
in
my
and
i
like
to
take
it
but
suppose
you
see
if
you
can
take
an
interest
in
these
ices
and
cakes
that
are
approaching
i
just
guess
i
can
said
patty
i
m
as
hungry
as
if
i
were
in
new
york
chapter
xix
pigeons
and
poetry
the
days
in
venice
rippled
by
so
happily
that
patty
couldn
t
realise
how
fast
they
were
going
their
own
party
was
usually
joined
by
some
or
all
of
the
three
young
men
whose
hotel
was
not
far
away
although
it
was
in
early
november
the
weather
was
only
pleasantly
crisp
and
during
much
of
the
day
it
was
warm
with
an
indian
summer
haze
in
the
air
what
mood
this
morning
oh
fair
one
with
golden
locks
said
floyd
austin
as
he
came
into
the
hotel
and
found
patty
idly
sitting
in
the
aimless
and
amiable
she
replied
smiling
at
him
ha
tis
a
mood
that
well
befitteth
mine
own
let
s
go
and
feed
the
all
right
let
s
flo
s
having
her
hair
washed
and
nan
and
father
have
gone
off
somewhere
so
i
m
glad
to
have
somebody
to
play
h
m
a
doubtful
compliment
but
i
ll
forgive
you
get
your
patty
flew
for
her
hat
and
cloak
and
paused
to
look
in
at
flo
s
door
i
m
going
to
the
piazza
she
said
with
floyd
to
feed
the
pigeons
come
on
over
when
your
hair
is
all
right
i
will
said
flo
as
intelligibly
as
she
could
through
masses
of
wet
locks
patty
ran
on
downstairs
and
joined
floyd
and
together
they
sauntered
along
toward
the
piazza
i
can
t
imagine
being
busy
in
venice
said
patty
looking
at
the
idlers
of
all
castes
that
were
everywhere
about
i
don
t
see
how
they
ever
get
anything
they
don
t
said
floyd
nobody
has
anything
to
do
or
if
he
does
he
doesn
t
do
it
let
s
cross
over
here
and
look
in
the
shop
yes
i
love
to
look
in
windows
and
i
want
to
get
some
silver
things
for
my
memory
chain
what
shall
i
get
absurd
question
of
course
you
must
get
a
little
silver
gondola
there
s
a
beauty
see
it
and
a
lion
of
mark
and
a
pigeon
oh
venice
has
so
many
typical
toys
it
s
too
easy
yes
so
it
is
i
had
hard
work
to
find
anything
in
florence
they
went
into
several
shops
one
after
another
and
patty
bought
little
trinkets
to
hang
on
her
chain
and
other
souvenirs
beside
what
a
very
long
tail
the
lion
has
she
said
as
she
looked
at
some
bronze
that
were
models
of
the
famous
beast
yes
it
would
make
a
lovely
poem
the
lion
of
mark
s
with
his
very
long
tail
go
wept
a
whole
week
cos
he
wasn
t
a
whale
said
patty
promptly
for
making
verses
was
one
of
their
favourite
games
go
on
for
he
said
here
is
water
all
over
the
place
and
i
m
sure
i
could
swim
with
exquisite
good
for
you
patty
you
had
the
rhyming
lines
that
s
hardest
i
ll
take
em
next
all
right
here
you
are
a
poor
little
pigeon
was
hungry
one
day
and
he
hoped
floyd
and
patty
would
come
by
that
as
they
were
approaching
he
spied
them
afar
and
he
said
what
a
couple
they
are
oh
floyd
how
vain
you
are
speak
for
yourself
you
don
t
seem
to
object
to
your
own
share
of
the
pigeon
s
of
course
i
don
t
come
on
after
that
compliment
from
the
pigeon
we
must
give
him
a
whole
heap
of
how
will
you
know
which
pigeon
s
the
one
oh
i
can
tell
by
the
expression
in
his
eye
get
some
corn
please
a
lot
of
as
they
neared
the
east
end
of
the
piazza
they
had
to
step
carefully
lest
they
tread
on
the
hundreds
of
pigeons
which
crowded
their
feet
eager
for
corn
floyd
bought
the
corn
from
the
vendors
near
by
and
handed
a
parcel
to
patty
now
i
see
why
they
call
these
cornucopias
she
said
taking
the
paper
horn
that
held
the
yellow
kernels
i
suppose
this
shaped
twist
of
paper
was
first
used
to
hold
corn
for
mark
s
of
course
it
was
somebody
had
a
corner
in
corn
and
so
he
had
to
invent
cornucopias
to
hold
it
what
nonsense
you
talk
said
patty
giggling
at
his
foolishness
there
that
s
the
pigeon
who
has
been
watching
and
waiting
for
she
pointed
to
a
very
large
fat
bird
who
stood
with
a
pompous
air
a
little
aloof
from
the
rest
his
neck
and
breast
shone
in
the
sunlight
and
the
iridescent
gleams
shimmered
with
every
graceful
movement
he
s
proud
said
patty
and
won
t
deign
to
coax
for
corn
like
the
he
s
stuffed
you
mean
i
don
t
believe
he
could
eat
another
grain
unless
it
was
pushed
down
his
throat
for
him
the
last
three
letters
of
his
name
should
be
pronounced
oh
he
isn
t
any
such
thing
he
s
simply
more
polite
than
the
rest
watch
him
patty
threw
some
corn
to
him
and
the
pigeon
ate
it
with
a
quiet
dignity
but
they
soon
realised
that
any
more
might
give
him
a
fit
of
apoplexy
so
they
fed
it
all
to
the
others
it
was
great
fun
to
watch
the
pigeons
and
especially
to
watch
the
little
children
feed
them
babies
of
two
or
three
years
would
timidly
throw
a
grain
of
corn
and
then
run
squealing
away
from
the
commotion
it
produced
let
s
go
and
see
something
said
patty
when
their
corn
was
all
gone
and
she
had
grown
tired
of
sitting
still
all
right
but
don
t
go
far
shall
it
be
the
cathedral
or
the
doge
s
palace
the
palace
i
want
to
go
into
those
horrible
dungeons
once
more
before
i
leave
so
they
loitered
slowly
through
the
rooms
of
the
palace
and
then
crossed
the
bridge
of
sighs
i
always
smile
when
i
cross
this
bridge
said
patty
because
the
poor
old
bridge
has
had
so
many
weeping
people
cross
it
that
i
m
sure
it
s
glad
of
the
of
course
it
is
we
ought
to
stand
here
and
grin
for
a
week
to
make
up
for
the
groans
and
wails
with
which
these
poor
old
walls
must
be
saturated
but
i
say
patty
here
s
a
small
party
of
tourists
with
a
guide
let
s
join
them
to
go
through
the
as
visitors
were
not
allowed
in
the
prisons
without
being
officially
conducted
this
was
a
good
plan
and
once
again
patty
made
the
tour
of
the
dark
dismal
holes
where
prisoners
were
confined
tortured
and
put
to
death
ugh
said
floyd
as
they
at
last
came
out
into
the
sunlight
again
how
can
you
want
to
see
those
horrors
when
you
can
look
at
this
instead
they
stood
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
palace
and
saw
spread
out
before
them
the
blue
water
sparkling
with
gold
ripples
the
blue
sky
flecked
with
soft
white
clouds
and
all
the
beautiful
vista
of
venice
i
don
t
know
said
patty
thoughtfully
i
didn
t
enjoy
it
as
a
spectacle
but
i
wanted
a
memory
of
those
prison
cells
as
well
as
of
the
beautiful
things
oh
here
comes
flo
isn
t
she
the
beautiful
thing
with
her
raving
locks
all
freshly
washed
and
ironed
flo
came
smiling
toward
them
followed
by
the
inevitable
snippy
who
having
had
her
lesson
never
let
her
young
mistress
stir
without
her
but
nobody
minded
for
snippy
was
an
agreeable
if
not
very
merry
companion
and
too
she
had
a
kind
habit
of
effacing
herself
from
the
conversation
when
the
young
people
wanted
to
chatter
nonsense
the
last
evening
of
their
stay
in
venice
fairfield
gave
a
they
had
made
a
number
of
pleasant
acquaintances
and
these
in
addition
to
their
own
immediate
party
made
about
two
score
several
gondolas
had
been
engaged
and
these
the
gondoliers
with
rival
pride
had
decorated
gaily
lanterns
swung
from
the
cabins
and
flowers
and
gay
streamers
gave
the
craft
a
festal
air
the
gondoliers
too
wore
brilliant
garb
and
as
the
fleet
floated
away
from
the
hotel
it
was
a
picturesque
sight
patty
wore
a
fluffy
light
blue
dress
and
a
long
light
blue
cloak
lined
with
white
silk
which
enveloped
her
from
head
to
foot
it
had
an
ermine
collar
for
the
evenings
were
growing
chill
and
a
dainty
blue
toque
edged
with
ermine
sat
saucily
on
patty
s
gold
curls
you
look
a
picture
said
peter
homer
as
he
handed
her
into
a
gondola
an
old
master
asked
patty
smiling
gaily
at
him
no
indeed
rather
like
one
of
your
new
american
masters
who
draw
such
fascinating
thank
you
for
a
subtle
compliment
said
patty
comfortably
arranging
herself
on
the
seat
you
may
sit
beside
me
for
thank
you
my
effort
was
not
in
vain
then
virtue
like
venice
is
its
own
the
fleet
started
and
made
a
delightful
trip
along
the
grand
canal
and
through
many
of
the
most
picturesque
smaller
canals
their
gondolas
kept
together
as
much
as
possible
and
gay
chat
was
tossed
across
from
one
to
another
returning
they
stopped
at
the
piazza
and
sat
for
a
time
or
strolled
about
listening
to
the
music
of
the
band
then
all
walked
the
short
distance
to
the
royal
danieli
and
gathered
in
one
of
the
smaller
ballrooms
which
fairfield
had
engaged
some
musicians
played
and
a
delightful
dance
ensued
patty
always
enjoyed
dancing
and
treated
quite
impartially
the
many
partners
who
begged
to
be
favoured
isn
t
she
a
wonder
said
caddy
oram
to
peter
homer
as
patty
waltzed
by
with
floyd
the
most
sunshiny
girl
i
have
ever
seen
said
peter
gazing
at
graceful
patty
who
smiled
back
at
him
over
floyd
s
shoulder
the
dance
ended
all
too
soon
and
then
the
guests
were
ushered
to
the
where
a
supper
was
spread
on
small
tables
it
would
be
a
lovely
party
said
patty
if
it
weren
t
to
celebrate
our
last
evening
in
venice
that
makes
me
it
makes
me
said
floyd
venice
without
you
is
as
dust
and
ashes
my
soul
is
as
a
crushed
cauliflower
and
wae
s
me
come
along
with
us
said
patty
ignoring
his
show
of
grief
the
venetians
will
let
you
off
i
m
that
may
be
madame
but
i
ve
affairs
of
more
importance
than
trailing
an
american
girl
all
over
the
map
of
i
d
like
to
follow
the
trail
said
peter
homer
but
i
ve
been
summoned
back
to
london
and
england
i
wish
i
could
take
you
all
home
with
me
said
patty
enthusiastically
you
re
a
lovely
bunch
of
boys
and
you
d
grace
any
thank
ye
ma
am
said
floyd
as
they
all
bowed
politely
and
when
they
took
leave
the
three
declared
that
they
would
be
on
hand
next
morning
to
conduct
the
fairfield
party
to
the
railway
station
true
to
their
word
they
appeared
in
ample
time
to
escort
the
travellers
several
gondolas
were
required
and
it
somehow
happened
that
peter
homer
and
patty
with
one
or
two
trunks
occupied
one
of
them
alone
this
is
as
it
should
be
he
said
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
i
m
glad
to
be
with
you
as
you
see
the
last
of
venice
but
i
hope
we
shall
meet
here
again
i
hope
so
said
patty
carelessly
i
suppose
i
shall
come
again
everybody
does
but
will
you
be
here
then
yes
if
you
call
me
i
ll
have
to
be
here
to
guide
your
impressions
in
the
right
canals
you
mean
said
patty
laughing
at
his
serious
face
very
well
canals
you
are
an
apt
pupil
tell
me
now
what
is
venice
like
this
morning
patty
looked
around
at
the
glowing
scene
the
autumn
sunshine
the
crisp
fine
air
the
beauty
of
form
and
colour
everywhere
then
she
said
liquid
sunlight
streaming
down
as
if
strained
through
a
golden
rubbish
cried
floyd
as
in
another
gondola
he
drifted
alongside
where
d
you
get
that
padded
plush
sentiment
patty
isn
t
it
poetic
she
said
turning
to
peter
with
a
look
of
mock
anxiety
no
he
replied
it
s
forced
and
ridiculous
and
you
know
yes
so
i
do
said
patty
her
face
dimpling
into
smiles
but
you
always
make
me
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
feel
that
way
about
oh
well
you
re
so
foolishly
young
yet
but
you
ll
get
over
it
meantime
will
you
accept
a
tiny
souvenir
of
the
grand
canal
peter
offered
her
a
little
gold
gondola
of
such
exquisite
workmanship
that
patty
gave
a
cry
of
delight
it
s
lovely
she
said
far
too
pretty
for
my
memory
i
shall
hang
it
on
my
she
fastened
it
to
the
slender
chain
that
held
her
watch
and
smiled
her
thanks
at
peter
i
shall
always
think
of
you
when
i
see
it
she
said
and
sometimes
when
i
don
i
shall
often
think
of
you
he
responded
and
shall
look
forward
to
meeting
you
again
sometime
oh
come
to
new
york
cried
patty
you
are
coming
aren
t
you
and
we
ll
have
an
italian
days
reunion
will
you
come
floyd
and
flo
the
other
gondola
had
drifted
near
again
and
all
were
gaily
promising
to
meet
again
in
new
york
when
the
quay
of
the
railway
station
was
reached
and
everybody
scrambled
out
then
in
the
general
flurry
of
looking
after
luggage
and
getting
seats
in
the
train
there
was
no
opportunity
for
further
talk
but
peter
said
earnestly
may
i
write
to
you
patty
and
will
you
answer
my
letters
oh
indeed
i
will
i
d
love
to
hear
from
you
and
of
course
i
ll
write
she
gave
him
her
card
and
then
after
general
farewells
intermingled
with
much
nonsense
and
laughter
the
fairfield
family
with
flo
and
snippy
started
for
rome

xx
homeward
bound

am
glad
to
be
in
rome

flo
as
they
once
more
sat
at
tea
in
the
of
the
hotel
rome
again
rome
again
from
a
foreign
shore
sang
patty
but
it
doesn
t
seem
like

none
of
the
other
wonderers
and

you
re
going
too
oh
patty
how
i
shall
miss
you

miss
you

kitty
all
about
it
when
i
go
back
i
wish
she
could
have
been
here
with
yes
i
hoped
to
have
her
but
i
find
she
s
a
most
uncertain
personage
but
what
s
the
use
of
repining
the
sun
may
be
shining
that
s
just
you
all
over
patty
i
believe
whoever
composed
that
classic
couplet
must
have
known
you
do
you
never
repine
to
tell
you
the
awful
truth
flo
i
don
t
quite
know
what
that
word
means
i
daresay
is
to
pine
again
but
you
see
i
don
t
know
how
to
pine
the
first
oh
patty
you
re
a
silly
but
i
can
tell
you
peter
homer
is
going
to
do
some
pining
after
really
oh
flo
how
you
embarrass
me
i
don
t
know
where
to
hide
my
blushing
saucy
patty
was
not
embarrassed
a
bit
and
flo
well
knew
it
but
flo
had
felt
ever
so
tiny
a
tinge
of
jealousy
at
the
evident
interest
homer
took
in
patty
and
she
couldn
t
resist
speaking
of
it
don
t
you
care
patty
if
he
pines
for
you
i
can
t
conscientiously
say
that
i
do
remarked
patty
with
a
judicial
air
he
s
free
to
pine
if
he
enjoys
it
i
m
don
t
you
care
for
him
specially
patty
went
on
flo
determined
to
learn
patty
s
sentiment
toward
him
deed
i
don
t
i
like
him
a
lot
he
s
one
of
the
kindest
and
cleverest
men
i
know
but
as
to
liking
him
specially
as
you
call
it
i
truly
don
do
you
like
any
one
specially
persisted
flo
for
goodness
gracious
sake
flo
what
is
the
matter
with
you
if
you
mean
am
i
in
love
with
anybody
i
certainly
am
not
and
don
t
expect
to
be
for
several
hundred
years
yet
so
there
now
you
re
a
funny
girl
patty
i
expect
to
be
married
before
i
m
well
i
don
t
and
i
don
t
want
to
i
may
get
married
sometime
in
the
distant
future
if
i
find
anybody
i
can
pine
for
but
i
m
only
eighteen
now
and
i
can
t
be
bothering
with
such
you
ll
be
nineteen
next
so
i
will
well
come
round
then
and
i
ll
talk
to
you
about
it
have
some
tea
flo
and
patty
had
grown
to
be
devoted
friends
and
both
were
really
sorry
that
their
parting
was
so
near
a
week
s
stay
in
rome
and
then
the
fairfields
would
leave
for
naples
and
so
home
by
way
of
the
mediterranean
while
flo
and
snippy
would
return
at
once
to
england
the
few
days
in
rome
were
devoted
to
farewell
glimpses
of
favourite
spots
patty
with
flo
and
snippy
roamed
round
the
forum
and
gazed
at
the
coliseum
and
many
of
the
churches
one
evening
leland
took
them
all
to
dinner
in
a
delightful
restaurant
that
overlooked
the
palatine
i
don
t
feel
that
i
know
my
palatine
at
all
said
patty
regretfully
don
t
try
to
said
leland
kindly
nobody
really
knows
the
palatine
except
the
great
scholars
when
in
the
palatine
just
flounder
about
and
get
the
whole
as
a
general
picture
of
ruined
glory
that
s
all
you
can
yes
agreed
patty
i
have
a
memory
of
livia
s
house
and
augustus
s
house
and
the
rest
and
it
doesn
t
really
matter
much
who
s
who
in
the
palatine
does
it
not
a
bit
said
leland
but
you
can
get
a
fair
idea
of
the
whole
from
this
he
took
patty
out
on
a
balcony
of
the
restaurant
used
in
summer
as
an
and
showed
her
the
general
view
of
the
palatine
hill
the
others
followed
and
listened
with
interest
while
leland
pointed
out
the
various
ruins
it
s
splendid
said
nan
who
was
really
more
of
a
student
of
these
things
than
patty
i
shall
always
remember
this
view
it
makes
me
feel
nearer
to
ancient
rome
than
any
i
don
t
want
you
to
get
too
near
to
ancient
rome
said
fairfield
laughing
as
he
led
her
back
indoors
i
want
to
keep
you
in
the
twentieth
century
for
some
time
the
last
day
in
rome
patty
was
quite
pensive
for
her
she
went
and
sat
on
the
spanish
steps
she
bought
another
large
photograph
of
the
coliseum
and
some
more
models
of
the
forum
which
last
however
were
broken
to
bits
long
before
she
reached
home
i
don
t
see
why
they
don
t
make
the
silly
things
stronger
she
said
as
on
reaching
the
hotel
she
found
two
of
the
models
in
fragments
because
they
re
ruins
said
nan
consolingly
those
old
columns
are
nearly
all
in
ruins
so
it
s
fitting
the
little
models
should
follow
in
their
pshaw
said
patty
flinging
away
the
bits
she
had
been
trying
to
piece
together
there
s
no
use
getting
any
more
of
those
they
smash
if
you
look
at
don
t
look
at
them
then
said
nan
sweetly
i
ll
try
to
get
some
ones
that
s
the
only
kind
of
cast
that
won
t
break
said
patty
as
she
contented
herself
with
photographs
instead
it
was
a
lovely
sunshiny
autumn
day
when
the
fairfields
started
for
naples
our
party
grows
smaller
every
time
we
move
said
patty
to
flo
now
we
are
dropping
you
and
snippy
but
i
suppose
father
and
nan
and
i
will
stick
together
till
we
reach
new
you
ll
have
to
said
practical
flo
unless
you
leave
one
at
naples
or
i
wish
you
were
going
to
naples
with
i
wish
so
too
patty
but
mother
has
written
us
to
come
home
and
we
really
must
go
but
it
has
been
a
lovely
pleasure
trip
with
you
and
i
m
sure
we
ll
meet
of
course
we
shall
you
surely
must
come
to
new
york
snippy
can
bring
you
can
t
she
yes
indeed
snippy
could
take
me
to
the
north
pole
if
we
decided
to
well
see
that
she
brings
you
to
new
york
first
and
now
flo
dearie
write
to
me
soon
and
often
miss
and
then
everybody
said
to
everybody
else
and
the
travellers
took
the
train
and
patty
waved
to
flo
from
the
window
and
called
again
and
then
they
started
and
the
fairfields
were
once
more
by
themselves
you
ll
be
dull
patsy
said
her
father
with
only
your
own
relatives
to
entertain
what
a
libel
daddy
was
i
ever
dull
no
but
there
must
be
a
first
time
for
well
it
won
t
be
while
i
ve
you
and
my
vivacious
stepmother
for
travelling
and
truly
it
didn
t
seem
so
nan
and
patty
fell
to
chattering
until
fairfield
had
difficulty
in
getting
in
a
word
edgewise
at
last
he
took
refuge
in
a
newspaper
and
finally
fell
asleep
while
the
loquacious
two
chattered
on
they
had
not
been
much
together
while
patty
had
the
younger
girls
about
and
as
they
were
really
very
good
chums
they
had
much
to
talk
over
it
seemed
but
a
short
trip
and
before
they
knew
it
they
were
in
naples
i
know
i
shall
hate
this
place
said
patty
in
tones
of
firm
conviction
it
s
the
dirtiest
and
beggariest
town
in
all
but
as
they
started
in
an
open
cab
for
their
hotel
patty
changed
her
mind
i
don
t
see
any
dirt
she
said
they
must
have
swept
lately
and
not
a
beggar
has
begged
the
driver
pointed
out
the
places
of
interest
as
they
went
along
and
patty
s
admiration
steadily
increased
i
love
naples
she
said
finally
whoever
jumped
on
it
was
all
people
don
t
jump
on
things
in
italy
said
her
father
reprovingly
no
they
re
too
lazy
to
jump
agreed
patty
what
hotel
are
we
going
to
father
to
the
palace
hotel
up
on
the
they
re
all
palace
hotels
in
italy
aren
t
they
is
that
it
way
up
in
the
sky
how
ever
did
it
perch
itself
up
on
that
high
place
spread
its
wings
and
flew
up
there
said
her
father
i
think
it
went
up
there
to
get
a
good
view
of
the
bay
said
nan
the
bay
of
naples
cried
patty
standing
up
in
the
cab
to
look
behind
her
i
ve
seen
it
on
postcards
and
it
s
almost
as
blue
really
oh
people
isn
t
it
great
sit
down
patty
you
ll
break
your
not
in
this
gently
moving
chaise
oh
we
re
climbing
this
great
hill
see
how
the
road
winds
and
how
the
cliffs
beetle
said
nan
yes
that
s
just
it
these
are
beetling
crags
i
never
realised
what
that
meant
before
and
see
this
strange
thing
it
must
be
the
ruins
of
an
old
dungeon
see
how
it
juts
and
slopes
straight
up
the
mountain
a
castle
ruined
by
an
earthquake
probably
what
is
it
driver
a
landslide
oh
said
patty
in
disgust
i
thought
it
was
a
ruined
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
really
high
hill
they
alighted
at
the
entrance
to
the
hotel
and
a
peculiar
entrance
it
was
first
they
walked
through
a
long
straight
corridor
that
had
been
cut
horizontally
into
the
cliff
from
this
a
vertical
was
cut
straight
up
to
the
hotel
itself
many
feet
above
the
ride
up
in
the
elevator
seemed
interminable
but
at
last
they
stepped
out
into
a
beautiful
parlour
from
which
naples
could
be
seen
below
them
in
every
direction
oh
oh
exclaimed
patty
running
from
the
view
of
the
bay
to
that
of
vesuvius
and
then
to
the
city
view
i
never
saw
such
a
fascinating
place
stay
over
another
steamer
daddy
don
t
let
s
go
home
we
ll
settle
that
question
later
now
let
s
go
and
find
our
rooms
puss
and
then
you
can
come
back
here
the
views
will
probably
keep
an
hour
or
they
followed
an
attendant
through
long
corridors
and
labyrinthine
ways
and
came
at
last
to
their
rooms
which
looked
out
upon
the
beautiful
bay
with
capri
smiling
sunnily
across
the
blue
and
vesuvius
standing
calmly
on
the
other
side
patty
in
ecstasies
of
delight
could
scarcely
wait
to
unpack
her
things
and
danced
into
nan
s
room
exclaiming
anew
at
the
beauties
of
the
hotel
the
city
and
italy
in
general
you
goose
said
nan
one
would
think
you
d
never
seen
anything
at
all
before
do
you
like
it
better
than
venice
or
rome
no
not
better
said
patty
slowly
but
you
see
i
didn
t
expect
to
like
it
at
all
and
so
it
s
such
a
well
run
and
put
on
a
fresh
frock
for
tea
and
then
you
can
rhapsodise
while
i
refresh
myself
with
i
m
hungry
too
said
patty
but
then
i
always
she
flew
away
to
dress
and
soon
the
family
sat
in
the
enjoying
strange
little
neapolitan
cakes
that
all
declared
the
best
in
the
world
after
tea
fairfield
said
they
would
have
time
for
a
short
drive
before
dinner
patty
was
delighted
at
this
prospect
and
skipped
away
for
her
hat
and
cloak
the
rickety
old
cab
made
her
laugh
but
as
they
drove
along
she
saw
none
better
so
decided
that
they
were
a
style
peculiar
to
naples
they
visited
no
museums
or
palaces
as
fairfield
said
it
was
but
a
preliminary
drive
and
they
must
return
for
dinner
so
back
they
went
soon
climbing
the
high
hill
slowly
though
it
seemed
to
patty
not
nearly
so
high
nor
so
steep
as
the
first
time
they
drove
up
the
long
trip
up
in
the
elevator
was
unpleasant
to
nan
who
feared
an
accident
but
patty
said
nonsense
it
s
just
like
the
subway
up
on
end
and
no
danger
of
meeting
another
dinner
was
rather
a
pretentious
function
in
the
hotel
so
our
party
donned
evening
dress
and
came
down
at
eight
o
clock
to
find
the
gorgeous
and
brilliantly
lighted
lovely
strains
of
music
came
from
an
orchestra
behind
a
screen
of
palms
and
the
viands
were
of
the
best
it
a
lovely
place
said
nan
i
quite
agree
with
you
patty
and
i
m
surprised
at
it
all
after
dinner
they
strolled
about
in
the
various
attractive
rooms
and
patty
thought
she
d
never
tire
of
the
beautiful
view
of
naples
by
night
that
was
spread
out
below
them
the
street
lights
looked
like
long
strings
of
jewels
and
the
brightly
lighted
houses
added
to
the
splendour
of
the
scene
on
the
other
side
was
the
bay
misty
now
and
pierced
here
and
there
with
the
shipping
lights
long
after
they
had
gone
to
their
rooms
patty
sat
at
her
window
enthralled
with
the
strange
beauty
so
different
from
all
else
she
had
seen
that
it
seemed
like
an
enchanted
land
after
several
days
of
in
and
around
naples
which
had
included
trips
to
vesuvius
and
to
amalfi
fairfield
called
a
council
of
war
to
decide
upon
further
plans
i
ve
passage
engaged
as
you
know
he
said
for
december
first
this
will
get
us
home
about
the
middle
of
the
month
and
give
us
a
little
time
to
get
our
breath
before
the
christmas
holidays
but
if
you
two
girls
prefer
we
can
change
our
tickets
and
stay
here
till
the
that
wouldn
t
get
us
home
by
christmas
day
said
patty
thoughtfully
no
we
d
be
on
the
atlantic
on
christmas
but
we
must
take
one
steamer
or
the
well
i
ll
leave
it
to
nan
said
patty
but
personally
i
d
hate
to
spend
christmas
on
an
ocean
liner
it
doesn
t
seem
i
agree
to
all
that
said
nan
i
love
naples
but
i
d
rather
go
next
week
and
so
be
home
in
time
to
look
after
a
little
christmas
celebration
of
some
sort
than
to
stay
here
all
right
then
said
fairfield
my
inclinations
are
to
go
on
the
first
so
we
ll
consider
it
settled
and
put
in
all
the
fun
we
can
these
few
days
that
are
so
the
three
spent
the
rest
of
the
time
in
seeing
naples
thoroughly
they
visited
the
aquarium
and
the
royal
palace
and
the
national
museum
they
visited
capri
and
they
drove
out
to
posilipo
and
camaldoli
and
every
day
they
grew
more
fond
of
the
beautiful
environs
that
surrounded
naples
but
their
thoughts
began
to
turn
to
home
and
christmas
and
reunion
of
friends
and
delightful
as
their
pleasure
trip
had
been
it
was
with
a
satisfied
feeling
in
their
hearts
that
they
at
last
went
aboard
the
great
steamer
that
was
to
land
them
in
new
york
beautiful
italy
said
patty
waving
her
handkerchief
as
they
steamed
away

soon
