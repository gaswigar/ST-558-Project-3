by

was
carried

love

of
our

of
the
subduing
of
the

of
that
submission

the

that
be
which
is
so
necessary

already
dealt

de

raised
his
long
pale
refined
head
adorned
by
beautiful
curled
locks
as
though
by
a
louis
quatorze
wig
but
this
time
said
he
would
it
not
be
expedient
while
repeating
these
declarations
to
show
that
reserve
appropriate
to
the
position
of
the
secular
powers
shaken
as
they
are
by
internal
convulsions
and
henceforth
incapable
of
imparting
to
their
covenants
what
they
themselves
do
not
mean
continuity
and
stability
for
you
must
see
monseigneur
that
the
decline

parliamentary
predominance
the
shook
his
head
without
reservation
monsieur
de
goulet
without
any
species
of
reservation
you
are
full
of
learning
and
piety
monsieur
de
goulet
but
your
old
pastor
can
still
give
you
a
few
lessons
in
discretion
before
handing
over
the
government
of
the
diocese
at
his
death
to
your
youthful
energy
have
we
not
to
congratulate
ourselves
upon
the
attitude
of
who
regards
our
schools
and
our
labours
with
favour
and
are
we
not
welcoming
to
our
table
the
general
in
command
of
the

and
the
and
of
that
let
me
see

and

gave
special
directions
that
the

should
be
ordered
from

the
poacher

a
servant
entered
and
presented
him
with
a
card
on
a
silver
tray
having
read
the
name
of
abbé
lantaigne
head
of
the
high
seminary
on
the
card
monseigneur
turned
towards
his
i
ll
wager
said
he
that
lantaigne
is
coming
to
complain
to
me
again
about
abbé
de
goulet
rose
to
leave
the
salon
but
monseigneur
stopped
him
stay
i
want
you
to
share
with
me
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
lantaigne
who
as
you
know
is
spoken
of
as
the
finest
preacher
in
the
diocese
for
if
one
listened
only
to
public
opinion
it
would
seem
that
he
preaches
better
than
you
dear
monsieur
de
goulet
but
that
is
not
my
opinion
between
ourselves
i
care
neither
for
his
inflated
style
nor
for
his
involved
scholarship
he
is
terribly
wearisome
and
i
am
keeping
you
here
to
help
me
to
get
rid
of
him
as
quickly
as
a
priest
entered
the
salon
and
bowed
he
was
very
tall
and
immensely
corpulent
with
a
serious
simple
abstracted
face
at
sight
of
him
monseigneur
exclaimed
gaily
ah
monsieur
l
abbé
lantaigne
at
the
very
moment
that
you
sent
in
your
name
the
and
i
were
talking
about
you
we
were
saying
that
you
are
the
most
distinguished
orator
in
the
diocese
and
that
the
lenten
course
you
preached
at
is
proof
positive
of
your
great
talents
and
profound
abbé
lantaigne
reddened
he
was
sensitive
to
praise
and
it
was
by
the
door
of
pride
alone
that
the
enemy
could
find
entrance
to
his
soul
monseigneur
he
answered
his
face
lit
up
by
a
smile
which
quickly
died
away
the
approval
of
your
eminence
gives
me
a
deep
delight
which
comes
felicitously
to
soothe
the
opening
of
an
interview
which
is
a
painful
one
to
me
for
it
is
a
complaint
which
the
head
of
the
high
seminary
has
the
misfortune
to
pour
into
your
paternal
monseigneur
interrupted
him
tell
me
monsieur
lantaigne
has
that
lenten
course
at
been
printed
a
synopsis
of
it
appeared
in
the
diocesan
i
am
moved
monseigneur
by
the
marks
of
interest
which
you
deign
to
show
in
my
apostolic
labours
alas
it
is
long
enough
ago
since
i
first
entered
the
pulpit
in
when
i
had
too
many
sermons
i
gave
them
to
roquette
who
has
since
been
raised
to
a
ah
cried
monseigneur
with
a
smile
that
good
roquette
when
i
went
last
year
limina
i
met
roquette
for
the
first
time
just
as
he
was
gaily
setting
out
for
the
vatican
a
week
later
i
met
him
in
s
where
he
was
imbibing
the
solace
that
he
much
needed
after
being
refused
the
cardinal
s
and
why
demanded
lantaigne
in
a
voice
that
whistled
like
a
why
should
the
purple
have
descended
on
the
shoulders
of
this
poor
creature
a
mediocrity
in
character
a
nonentity
in
doctrine
whose
mental
density
has
made
him
ridiculous
and
whose
sole
recommendation
is
that
he
has
sat
at
table
with
the
president
of
the
republic
at
a
masonic
banquet
could
roquette
only
rise
above
himself
he
would
be
astonished
at
finding
himself
a
bishop
in
these
times
of
trial
when
a
future
confronts
us
pregnant
with
awful
menace
as
well
as
with
gracious
promise
it
would
be
expedient
to
build
up
a
body
of
clergy
powerful
both
in
character
and
in
scholarship
and
in
fact
monseigneur
i
come
to
interview
your
eminence
about
another
roquette
about
another
priest
who
is
unfitted
to
sustain
the
weight
of
his
great
duties
the
professor
of
rhetoric
at
the
high
seminary
l
abbé
guitrel
monseigneur
interrupted
with
a
feigned
jest
and
asked
with
a
laugh
whether
abbé
guitrel
were
in
a
fair
way
to
become
a
bishop
in
his
turn
what
an
idea
monseigneur
cried
abbé
lantaigne
if
perchance
this
man
were
raised
to
a
bishopric
we
should
behold
once
more
the
days
of
cautinus
when
an
unworthy
pontiff
defiled
the
see
of
saint
the
curled
up
in
his
remarked
genially
cautinus
bishop
cautinus
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
the
name
cautinus
who
was
a
successor
of
saint
martin
are
you
quite
sure
that
this
cautinus
behaved
as
badly
as
they
make
out
it
is
an
interesting
point
in
the
history
of
the
gallic
church
concerning
which
i
should
much
like
to
have
the
opinion
of
so
learned
a
man
as
yourself
monsieur
the
head
of
the
high
seminary
drew
himself
up
the
testimony
monseigneur
of
gregory
of
tours
is
explicit
in
the
passage
touching
bishop
cautinus
this
successor
of
the
blessed
martin
lived
in
such
luxury
and
robbed
the
church
of
its
treasures
to
such
an
extent
that
at
the
end
of
two
years
of
his
administration
all
the
sacred
vessels
were
in
the
hands
of
the
jews
of
tours
and
if
i
have
coupled
the
name
of
cautinus
with
that
of
this
unhappy
guitrel
it
is
not
without
reason
guitrel
carries
off
the
artistic
curios
or
finely
chased
vessels
which
are
still
to
be
found
in
country
churches
in
the
care
of
ignorant
churchwardens
and
it
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
jews
that
he
devotes
himself
to
this
for
the
benefit
of
the
jews
demanded
monseigneur
what
is
this
that
you
are
telling
me
for
the
benefit
of
the
jews
returned
abbé
lantaigne
and
to
embellish
the
of
jew
and
freemason
madame
is
fond
of
antiquities
through
the
medium
of
guitrel
she
has
gained
possession
of
the
copes
treasured
for
three
hundred
years
in
the
vestry
of
the
church
at
lusancy
and
she
has
i
am
told
turned
them
into
seats
of
the
kind
called
monseigneur
shook
his
head
but
if
the
transfer
of
these
disused
vestments
has
been
conducted
legally
i
do
not
see
that
bishop
cautinus
i
mean
guitrel
has
done
wrong
in
taking
part
in
this
lawful
transaction
there
is
no
reason
why
these
copes
of
the
pious
priests
of
lusancy
should
be
revered
as
relics
of
the
saints
there
is
no
sacrilege
in
selling
their
clothes
to
be
turned
into
de
goulet
who
had
been
nibbling
his
pen
for
some
moments
could
not
refrain
from
a
murmur
he
deplored
the
fact
that
the
churches
should
be
thus
robbed
of
their
artistic
treasures
by
infidels
the
head
of
the
high
seminary
answered
in
firm
tones
let
us
monseigneur
if
you
please
drop
the
subject
of
the
trade
to
which
the
friend
of
the
jewish
devotes
himself
and
allow
me
to
enumerate
the
only
too
definite
complaints
which
i
have
to
bring
against
the
professor
of
rhetoric
at
the
high
seminary
i
impugn
first
his
doctrine
second
his
conduct
i
say
that
i
indict
first
his
doctrine
and
that
on
four
grounds
first
the
stretched
out
both
his
arms
as
though
to
ward
off
such
a
multitude
of
charges
monsieur
lantaigne
i
see
that
for
some
time
the
has
been
biting
his
pen
and
making
desperate
signs
to
remind
me
that
our
printer
is
waiting
for
our
pastoral
letter
which
has
to
be
read
on
sunday
in
the
churches
of
our
diocese
allow
me
to
finish
dictating
this
charge
which
i
trust
will
bring
some
solace
to
our
priests
and
faithful
abbé
lantaigne
bowed
and
very
sadly
withdrew
after
his
departure
the
turning
to
de
goulet
said
i
did
not
know
that
guitrel
was
so
friendly
with
the
and
i
am
grateful
to
the
head
of
the
seminary
for
having
warned
me
of
it
lantaigne
is
sincerity
itself
i
prize
his
frankness
and
straightforwardness
with
him
one
knows
where
one
is
he
corrected
himself
where
one
would
ii
lantaigne
principal
of
the
high
seminary
was
working
in
his
study
the
whitewashed
walls
of
which
were
three
parts
covered
by
deal
shelves
loaded
with
the
dark
bindings
of
his
working
library
the
whole
of
migne

and
cheap
editions
of

with
a
dusty
sprig
of
box
sticking
out
of
the
old
gilt
frame
uninviting
horsehair
chairs
stood
on
the
red
tiles
in
front
of
the
windows
through
which
the
stale
smell
of
the
refectory
ascended
to
the
cotton
the
principal
bending
over
his
little
desk
was
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
registers
handed
him
by
abbé
perruque
the
master
of
method
who
stood
at
his
side
i
see
said
lantaigne
that
again
this
week
a
hoard
of
sweetmeats
has
been
discovered
in
a
pupil
s
room
such
infractions
are
far
too
often
in
fact
the
students
of
the
seminary
made
a
practice
of
hiding
cakes
of
chocolate
among
their
this
was
what
they
called
theology
they
used
to
meet
in
a
room
at
night
by
twos
or
threes
to
discuss
it
lantaigne
begged
the
master
of
method
to
use
unfaltering
severity
this
disorder
is
deplorable
in
that
it
may
involve
the
most
serious
he
asked
for
the
register
of
the
rhetoric
class
but
when
perruque
had
handed
it
to
him
he
looked
away
from
it
his
heart
swelled
at
the
idea
that
sacred
rhetoric
was
taught
by
this
guitrel
a
man
with
neither
morals
nor
learning
he
sighed
within
himself
when
will
the
scales
fall
from
the
s
eyes
that
he
may
see
the
unworthiness
of
this
priest
then
tearing
himself
from
this
bitter
thought
only
to
plunge
into
the
bitterness
of
another
and
piédagnel
he
asked
for
two
years
firmin
piédagnel
had
caused
incessant
anxiety
to
the
head
of
the
seminary
the
only
son
of
a
cobbler
who
kept
his
stall
between
two
buttresses
of
he
was
through
the
brightness
of
his
intelligence
the
most
brilliant
pupil
in
the
house
of
placid
temperament
he
had
a
very
fair
report
for
conduct
the
timidity
of
his
character
and
the
weakness
of
his
constitution
seemed
a
good
safeguard
for
his
moral
purity
but
he
had
neither
the
instinct
for
theology
nor
the
vocation
for
the
priesthood
his
very
faith
was
unstable
with
his
great
spiritual
knowledge
lantaigne
had
no
inordinate
fear
of
those
violent
crises
among
his
young
levites
which
often
salutary
are
to
be
allayed
by
grace
he
dreaded
on
the
contrary
the
indifference
of
a
placidly
intractable
mind
he
almost
despaired
of
a
soul
to
whom
doubt
was
light
and
bearable
and
whose
thoughts
flowed
to
irreligion
by
a
natural
inclination
such
a
one
the
shoemaker
s
clever
son
showed
himself
to
be
lantaigne
had
one
day
unexpectedly
chanced
by
one
of
those
brusque
wiles
which
were
natural
to
him
to
plumb
the
depths
of
this
nature
through
its
courtesy
he
perceived
with
consternation
that
from
the
teaching
at
the
seminary
firmin
had
only
acquired
an
elegant
latin
style
skill
in
sophistry
and
a
kind
of
sentimental
mysticism
from
that
time
firmin
had
appeared
to
him
as
a
being
weak
and
formidable
pitiable
and
noxious
yet
he
loved
this
lad
loved
him
tenderly
to
infatuation
in
spite
of
his
disappointment
it
pleased
him
that
he
should
be
the
honour
the
glory
of
the
seminary
he
loved
in
firmin
the
charm
of
his
mind
the
subtle
harmony
of
his
style
and
even
the
tenderness
of
those
pale
eyes
like
bruises
under
the
quivering
eyelids
he
sometimes
took
pleasure
in
seeing
in
him
one
of
the
victims
of
this
abbé
guitrel
whose
intellectual
and
moral
poverty
must
so
he
firmly
believed
injure
and
depress
an
intelligent
and
pupil
he
flattered
himself
that
if
better
trained
in
the
future
firmin
although
too
weak
ever
to
give
to
the
church
one
of
those
powerful
leaders
whom
she
so
much
needs
would
at
least
produce
for
religion
perhaps
a
péreyve
or
a
gerbet
one
of
those
priests
who
carry
into
the
priesthood
the
heart
of
a
young
mother
but
incapable
of
long
lantaigne
speedily
rejected
this
unlikely
hope
and
saw
in
this
lad
a
guéroult
a
renan
and
the
sweat
of
anguish
chilled
his
forehead
his
fear
was
lest
in
rearing
such
pupils
he
might
be
training
formidable
enemies
of
the
truth
he
knew
that
it
was
in
the
temple
itself
that
the
hammers
were
forged
which
overthrew
it
he
very
often
said
such
is
the
power
of
theological
discipline
that
it
alone
is
capable
of
rearing
great
reprobates
an
unbeliever
who
has
not
passed
through
our
hands
is
powerless
and
without
weapons
for
evil
it
is
within
our
walls
that
they
imbibe
all
knowledge
even
that
of
from
the
mass
of
the
students
he
only
demanded
industry
and
integrity
feeling
certain
that
these
would
make
good
parish
priests
of
them
but
in
his
finest
students
he
feared
curiosity
pride
the
impious
boldness
of
the
intellect
and
even
the
qualities
that
brought
the
angels
to
perdition

the

on

over

piédagnel

written
a
poor
essay
on
the
unity
of
the

this
abbé
lantaigne
burst
out
is
just
what
he
will
never
grasp
and
yet
it
is
the
idea
above
all
others
which
ought
to
be
impressed
on
the
priest
s
mind
for
i
do
not
fear
to
affirm
that
this
conception
is
entirely
of
god
and
as
it
were
his
most
vivid
manifestation
among
he
turned
his
hollow
gloomy
gaze
towards
abbé

this
subject
of
the

of
the

monsieur

my
touchstone
by

they

not

in
sincerity

logical
conclusions

most

admirable
philosophy

monsieur

have
three
times
handled
the
unity
of
the

and
the
wealth
of
the
subject
still
amazes
he
resumed
his
reading

compiled
a
which
has
been
found
in

which
contains

in

extracts
from

composed
by
leconte
de

paul

as
well
as

excessive
profligacy

shut
the

put

back
to
this
blessed
unity
a
when

thou
end
when
wilt
thou
cease
to
be
oh
vanity
of
this
world
when
during
the
recreation
hour
after
the
midday
meal
the
principal
crossed
the
courtyard
the
seminarists
were
playing
a
game
of
football
on
the
gravelled
playground
there
was
a
great
commotion
of
ruddy
heads
poised
on
stalks
like
black
the
jerky
gestures
of
puppets
and
shouts
and
cries
in
all
the
rustic
dialects
of
the
diocese
the
master
of
method
abbé
perruque
his
cassock
tucked
up
was
joining
in
the
game
with
the
zest
of
a
cloistered
peasant
drunk
with
air
and
exercise
and
in
athletic
style
was
kicking
from
the
toe
of
his
buckled
shoe
the
huge
ball
covered
with
its
leather
quarters
at
sight
of
the
principal
the
players
stopped
lantaigne
made
a
sign
to
them
to
continue
he
followed
the
grove
of
stunted
acacia
trees
that
fringes
the
courtyard
on
the
side
towards
the
ramparts
and
the
country
along
he
met
three
pupils
who
arm
in
arm
were
walking
up
and
down
as
they
talked
since
they
usually
spent
the
recreation
hours
in
this
way
they
were
called
the
peripatetics
lantaigne
called
one
of
them
the
shortest
a
lad
with
slightly
stooping
shoulders
a
refined
and
mocking
mouth
and
timid
eyes
he
did
not
hear
at
first
and
his
neighbour
had
to
nudge
him
with
an
elbow
and
say
to
him
piédagnel
the
principal
is
calling
at
this
piédagnel
approached
abbé
lantaigne
and
bowed
to
him
with
a
clumsiness
my
child
said
the
principal
to
him
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
be
my
server
at
mass
the
young
man
blushed
it
was
a
coveted
honour
to
serve
the
principal
s
mass
abbé
lantaigne
his
breviary
under
his
arm
went
out
by
the
little
door
that
opens
on
the
fields
and
took
the
customary
road
in
his
walks
a
dusty
track
edged
with
nettles
and
thistles
that
follows
the
ramparts
he
was
thinking
what
will
become
of
this
poor
child
if
he
is
suddenly
expelled
ignorant
of
any
sort
of
manual
labour
weak
delicate
and
timid
and
what
grief
there
will
be
in
his
infirm
father
s
shop
he
walked
along
over
the
flints
of
the
barren
road
having
reached
the
mission
cross
he
took
off
his
hat
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
with
his
silk
handkerchief
and
said
in
a
low
voice
oh
god
inspire
me
to
act
according
to
thy
interests
whatever
it
may
cost
my
paternal
heart
at
six
next
morning
abbé
lantaigne
was
saying
the
concluding
words
of
the
mass
in
the
bare
deserted
chapel
in
front
of
a
a
solitary
old
sacristan
was
setting
paper
flowers
in
porcelain
vases
beneath
the
gilt
statue
of
saint
joseph
a
grey
rainy
daylight
poured
sadly
through
the
blurred
the
celebrant
upright
at
the
left
of
the
high
altar
was
reading
the
last
gospel
verbum
caro
factum
said
he
bending
his
knees
firmin
piédagnel
who
was
serving
the
mass
knelt
at
the
same
time
on
the
step
where
stood
the
bell
then
he
rose
and
after
the
last
responses
preceded
the
priest
into
the
sacristy
abbé
lantaigne
set
down
the
chalice
with
the
corporal
and
waited
for
the
server
to
help
him
remove
his
priestly
vestments
firmin
piédagnel
being
sensitive
to
the
mysterious
influences
of
things
felt
the
charm
of
this
scene
so
simple
and
yet
so
sacred
his
soul
suffused
with
tender
unction
tasted
with
a
kind
of
joy
the
familiar
grandeur
of
the
priesthood
never
had
he
felt
so
deeply
the
desire
to
be
a
priest
and
in
his
turn
to
celebrate
the
holy
sacrifice
having
kissed
and
carefully
folded
up
the
alb
and
chasuble
he
bowed
before
abbé
lantaigne
ere
retiring
the
head
of
the
seminary
who
had
resumed
his
made
a
sign
to
him
to
stay
and
looked
at
him
with
such
nobility
and
kindness
that
the
young
man
received
the
look
as
a
favour
and
a
blessing
after
a
long
silence
my
child
said
lantaigne
whilst
celebrating
this
mass
which
i
asked
you
to
serve
i
prayed
god
to
give
me
the
strength
to
send
you
away
my
prayer
has
been
granted
you
are
no
longer
a
member
of
this
as
he
took
in
these
words
firmin
was
stupefied
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
flooring
was
giving
way
beneath
his
feet
through
eyes
big
with
tears
he
vaguely
saw
the
lonely
road
the
rain
a
life
darkened
with
misery
and
toil
the
fate
of
a
lost
child
terrified
by
its
own
weakness
and
timidity
he
looked
at
lantaigne
the
resolute
gentleness
the
quiet
strength
the
calmness
of
this
man
revolted
him
suddenly
a
feeling
was
born
and
grew
in
him
a
feeling
that
sustained
and
strengthened
him
a
hatred
of
the
priest
a
deathless
and
fruitful
hatred
a
hatred
to
fill
a
whole
life
without
uttering
a
word
he
went
with
great
strides
out
of
the
sacristy
iii
abbé
lantaigne
head
of
the
high
seminary
of
wrote
the
following
letter
to
monseigneur
the
of
monseigneur
when
on
the
of
this
month
i
had
the
honour
of
being
received
by
your
eminence
i
feared
to
trespass
on
your
paternal
kindness
and
on
your
pastoral
clemency
by
expounding
at
sufficient
length
the
matter
about
which
i
came
to
converse
with
you
but
as
this
affair
reflects
on
your
high
and
holy
jurisdiction
and
concerns
the
government
of
this
diocese
which
counts
among
the
most
ancient
and
beautiful
provinces
of
christian
gaul
i
conceive
it
to
be
my
duty
to
submit
to
the
watchful
impartiality
of
your
eminence
the
facts
concerning
which
it
is
called
upon
to
judge
in
the
plenitude
of
its
authority
and
in
the
fulness
of
its
wisdom
in
bringing
these
facts
to
the
knowledge
of
your
eminence
i
am
fulfilling
a
duty
which
i
should
characterise
as
painful
to
my
heart
if
i
did
not
know
that
the
accomplishment
of
every
duty
brings
to
the
soul
an
inexhaustible
spring
of
consolation
and
that
it
is
not
enough
to
obey
god
if
one
does
not
obey
him
with
ready
gladness
the
facts
which
it
behoves
you
to
know
monseigneur
relate
to
abbé
guitrel
professor
of
rhetoric
at
the
high
seminary
i
will
state
them
as
briefly
and
as
accurately
as
possible
these
facts
concern
first
the
doctrine
second
the
morals
of
abbé
guitrel
i
will
first
state
the
facts
relating
to
guitrel
s
doctrine
on
reading
the
from
which
he
delivers
his
lectures
on
sacred
rhetoric
i
noticed
in
them
various
opinions
which
do
not
agree
with
the
tradition
of
the
church
first
guitrel
whilst
condemning
as
to
their
conclusions
the
commentaries
on
holy
scripture
drawn
up
by
atheists
and
reformers
does
not
condemn
them
in
their
principle
and
origin
in
which
he
is
seriously
in
error
for
it
is
evident
that
the
care
of
the
scriptures
having
been
confided
to
the
church
the
church
alone
is
capable
of
interpreting
the
books
which
she
alone
preserves
second
led
astray
by
the
recent
example
of
a
monk
who
thirsted
for
the
applause
of
the
age
guitrel
presumes
to
explain
the
scenes
of
the
gospel
by
means
of
that
pretended
local
colour
and
that
of
which
the
germans
make
a
great
show
and
he
does
not
perceive
that
by
thus
walking
in
the
way
of
infidels
he
is
skirting
the
abyss
into
which
they
have
fallen
i
should
weary
the
benevolent
attention
of
his
eminence
monseigneur
the
were
i
to
place
before
his
reverend
glance
the
passages
where
guitrel
with
pitiable
childishness
follows
the
narratives
of
travellers
as
to
the
on
the
lake
of
tiberias
and
those
where
with
intolerable
indecency
he
describes
what
he
calls
the
and
the
psychic
crises
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
these
foolish
innovations
blameworthy
in
a
cloistered
worldling
should
not
be
tolerated
in
a
secular
cleric
entrusted
with
the
instruction
of
young
aspirants
to
the
priesthood
hence
i
was
more
grieved
than
surprised
when
i
heard
that
an
intelligent
pupil
whom
i
have
since
been
obliged
to
expel
for
his
bad
disposition
described
the
professor
of
rhetoric
as
a
fin
de
siècle
priest
third
guitrel
affects
a
culpable
laxity
in
relying
on
the
untrustworthy
authority
of
clement
of
alexandria
who
is
not
included
in
the
martyrology
in
this
the
professor
of
rhetoric
betrays
the
weakness
of
a
mind
misled
by
the
example
of
the
mystics
who
imagine
that
they
find
in
the
a
purely
allegorical
interpretation
of
the
most
concrete
mysteries
of
the
christian
faith
and
without
actually
going
astray
guitrel
shows
himself
in
this
matter
to
be
inconsistent
and
fourth
since
depravity
of
taste
is
one
of
the
results
of
doctrinal
weakness
and
since
a
mind
which
rejects
strong
food
battens
on
worthless
nourishment
guitrel
seeks
models
of
eloquence
for
the
use
of
his
pupils
even
in
the
speeches
of
lacordaire
and
the
homilies
of
gratry
secondly
i
will
enumerate
the
facts
relating
to
guitrel
s
morals
first
abbé
guitrel
consorts
with
both
secretly
and
constantly
and
in
this
he
throws
off
the
reserve
which
it
always
behoves
an
ecclesiastic
of
lower
rank
to
observe
in
relation
to
the
public
authorities
a
reserve
which
under
present
circumstances
and
towards
a
jewish
official
there
is
no
excuse
for
dropping
and
by
the
care
which
he
takes
never
to
enter
the
prefecture
save
by
a
private
door
guitrel
seems
to
acknowledge
to
himself
the
falseness
of
a
position
which
he
nevertheless
maintains
it
is
also
notorious
that
guitrel
occupies
a
position
with
respect
to
madame
that
is
more
mercantile
than
religious
this
lady
is
fond
of
antiquities
and
although
a
jewess
she
does
not
despise
any
articles
connected
with
religion
provided
that
they
have
the
merit
of
art
or
of
antiquity
it
is
unhappily
well
attested
that
guitrel
busies
himself
in
buying
for
madame
at
an
absurd
price
the
antique
furniture
of
village
parsonages
left
in
the
care
of
ignorant
churchwardens
in
this
way
carved
wainscoting
priestly
vestments
chalices
and
pyxes
are
torn
from
the
sacristies
of
your
rural
churches
monseigneur
in
order
that
at
the
prefecture
they
may
adorn
the
private
apartments
of
and
madame
and
everybody
knows
that
madame
has
trimmed
with
the
splendid
and
sacred
copes
of
the
species
of
furniture
vulgarly
called
i
do
not
imply
that
guitrel
has
derived
any
material
and
direct
profit
from
these
transactions
but
it
must
needs
grieve
your
paternal
heart
that
a
priest
of
the
diocese
should
have
joined
in
robbing
your
churches
of
that
wealth
which
proves
even
in
the
eyes
of
unbelievers
the
superiority
of
christian
to
profane
art
second
without
complaint
or
protest
abbé
guitrel
allows
the
rumour
to
spread
and
grow
that
his
elevation
to
the
vacant
bishopric
of
tourcoing
is
favoured
by
the
president
of
the
council
the
minister
for
justice
and
religion
now
this
rumour
is
prejudicial
to
the
minister
for
although
a
freethinker
and
a
freemason
he
ought
to
be
too
careful
of
the
interests
of
the
church
over
which
he
has
been
appointed
civil
overseer
to
place
in
the
seat
of
the
blessed
loup
a
priest
such
as
guitrel
and
if
this
invention
were
to
be
traced
to
its
source
it
is
to
be
feared
that
in
guitrel
himself
would
be
found
the
first
and
foremost
contriver
of
it
third
having
formerly
occupied
his
leisure
in
translating
into
french
verse
the
bucolics
of
that
latin
poet
called
calpurnius
whom
the
best
critics
agree
in
relegating
to
the
lowest
class
of
insipid
babblers
abbé
guitrel
with
a
carelessness
which
i
would
fain
believe
to
be
quite
unintentional
has
allowed
this
work
of
his
youth
to
circulate
privately
a
copy
of
the
bucolics
was
addressed
to
the
radical
paper
of
the
district
which
published
extracts
from
it
among
them
there
occurred
in
particular
this
line
which
i
blush
to
put
before
the
paternal
eyes
of
your
eminence
and
our
heaven
of
bliss
is
a
breast
b
this
quotation
was
accompanied
in
by
the
most
derogatory
comments
on
the
private
character
as
well
as
the
literary
taste
of
abbé
guitrel
and
the
editor
whose
is
only
too
well
known
to
your
eminence
took
this
wretched
line
as
a
pretext
for
charges
of
wanton
thoughts
and
dishonourable
intentions
generally
against
all
the
professors
of
the
high
seminary
and
even
against
all
the
priests
in
the
diocese
this
is
why
without
inquiring
whether
as
a
scholar
guitrel
had
any
excuse
for
translating
calpurnius
i
deplore
the
publication
of
his
work
as
the
cause
of
a
scandal
which
i
am
sure
was
more
bitter
to
your
benevolent
heart
monseigneur
than
gall
and
wormwood
fourth
guitrel
is
in
the
habit
of
going
every
day
at
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
to
the
confectioner
s
shop
kept
by
dame
magloire
in
the
place
and
there
leaning
over
the
sideboards
counters
and
tables
he
examines
with
deep
interest
and
careful
diligence
the
dainties
piled
up
on
plates
and
dishes
then
stopping
at
the
spot
where
are
arranged
the
kinds
of
cakes
which
they
tell
me
are
called
and
he
touches
first
one
and
then
another
of
these
pasties
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
and
afterwards
has
these
dainty
morsels
wrapped
up
in
a
sheet
of
paper
far
be
it
from
me
to
bring
a
charge
of
sensuality
against
him
on
account
of
this
ridiculously
careful
choice
of
a
few
or
but
if
one
reflects
that
he
goes
to
dame
magloire
s
at
the
very
moment
when
the
shop
is
thronged
with
fashionable
folk
of
both
sexes
and
that
he
makes
himself
a
butt
for
the
jests
of
worldlings
one
will
ask
oneself
whether
the
professor
of
rhetoric
at
the
high
seminary
does
not
leave
some
part
of
his
dignity
behind
him
in
the
confectioner
s
shop
in
fact
the
choice
of
two
cakes
has
not
escaped
the
comment
of
observers
and
it
is
said
either
rightly
or
wrongly
that
guitrel
keeps
one
for
himself
and
gives
the
other
to
his
servant
he
may
doubtless
without
incurring
any
blame
share
any
dainties
with
the
woman
attached
to
his
service
especially
if
that
woman
has
attained
the
canonical
age
but
malicious
gossip
interprets
this
intimacy
and
familiarity
in
the
most
shameful
sense
and
i
should
never
dare
to
repeat
to
your
eminence
the
remarks
which
are
made
in
the
town
as
to
the
relations
between
guitrel
and
his
domestic
i
do
not
wish
to
entertain
these
charges
nevertheless
your
eminence
will
see
that
guitrel
is
not
easily
to
be
excused
for
having
given
a
show
of
truth
to
the
calumny
by
his
mischievous
behaviour
i
have
related
the
facts
it
now
remains
for
me
only
to
conclude
i
have
the
honour
to
propose
that
your
eminence
should
cancel
the
appointment
of
guitrel
joachim
as
professor
of
sacred
rhetoric
at
the
high
seminary
of
in
accordance
with
your
spiritual
powers
as
recognised
by
the
state
decree
of
march
vouchsafe
monseigneur
to
continue
your
paternal
kindness
towards
one
who
being
placed
in
command
of
your
seminary
has
no
dearer
wish
than
to
give
you
proofs
of
his
complete
devotion
and
of
the
profound
respect
with
which
he
has
the
honour
to
be
monseigneur
the
most
humble
and
obedient
servant
of
your
eminence
having
written
this
letter
lantaigne
sealed
it
with
his
seal
b
notre
ciel
à
nous
c
est
un
sein
iv
it
is
true
that
abbé
guitrel
professor
of
sacred
rhetoric
at
the
high
seminary
of
was
intimately
connected
with
and
with
madame
coblentz
but
abbé
lantaigne
was
wrong
in
believing
that
guitrel
frequented
the
of
the
prefecture
where
his
presence
would
have
been
equally
disquieting
to
the
archbishop
and
to
the
masonic
lodges
since
the
was
master
of
the
lodge
the
rising
it
was
in
the
confectioner
s
shop
kept
by
dame
magloire
in
the
place
where
he
went
every
saturday
at
five
o
clock
to
buy
two
little
cakes
one
for
his
servant
and
the
other
for
himself
that
the
priest
had
met
the
wife
while
she
was
eating
there
in
the
company
of
madame
lacarelle
wife
of
préfet
private
secretary
by
his
demeanour
at
once
obsequious
and
discreet
which
inspired
entire
confidence
and
removed
all
apprehensions
the
professor
of
sacred
rhetoric
had
instantly
gained
the
good
graces
of
madame
to
whom
he
suggested
the
mind
the
face
and
almost
the
sex
of
those
women
the
guardian
angels
of
her
youth
in
the
difficult
days
of
batignolles
and
the
place
clichy
when
noémi
coblentz
had
finished
growing
up
and
was
beginning
to
fade
in
the
business
office
kept
by
her
father
isaac
in
the
midst
of
and
one
of
these
dealers
in
clothes
a
madame
vacherie
who
esteemed
her
had
acted
as
for
her
and
an
active
and
promising
young
barrister
théodore
who
finding
her
and
practically
useful
had
married
her
after
the
birth
of
their
daughter
jeanne
and
she
in
return
had
cleverly
pushed
him
in
the
administration
abbé
guitrel
was
very
much
like
madame
vacherie
they
had
the
same
look
the
same
voice
the
same
gestures
this
propitious
likeness
had
aroused
in
madame
a
sudden
sympathy
besides
she
had
always
revered
the
catholic
clergy
as
one
of
the
powers
of
this
world
she
constituted
herself
guitrel
s
advocate
in
her
husband
s
good
graces
who
recognised
in
his
wife
a
quality
that
remained
him
a
deep
mystery
the
quality
of
tact
and
who
knew
her
to
be
clever
received
abbé
guitrel
courteously
the
first
time
he
met
him
in
the
jeweller
s
shop
kept
by
rondonneau
junior
in
the
rue
des
tintelleries
he
had
gone
there
to
see
the
designs
for
the
cups
ordered
by
the
state
to
be
given
as
prizes
in
the
races
organised
by
the
society
for
the
improvement
of
after
that
visit
he
frequently
returned
to
the
goldsmith
s
drawn
by
an
innate
taste
for
precious
metals
on
his
side
abbé
guitrel
contrived
frequent
occasions
for
visiting
the
of
rondonneau
the
younger
maker
of
sacred
vessels
candlesticks
lamps
pyxes
chalices
patens
monstrances
and
tabernacles
the
and
the
priest
were
not
at
these
meetings
in
the
out
of
sight
of
prying
eyes
in
front
of
a
counter
loaded
with
bullion
and
amidst
the
vases
and
statuettes
that
called
c
stretched
out
in
rondonneau
junior
s
one
sent
a
little
wave
of
his
hand
to
guitrel
who
black
and
fat
stole
along
by
the
glass
cases
like
a
great
rat
c
lit
pious
gimcrackeries
monsieur
l
abbé
delighted
to
see
you
and
it
was
true
he
vaguely
felt
that
in
contact
with
this
ecclesiastic
of
peasant
stock
as
french
in
priestly
character
and
in
type
as
the
blackened
stones
of
and
the
old
trees
on
the
mall
he
was
frenchifying
himself
naturalising
himself
stripping
off
the
ponderous
remnants
of
his
german
and
semitic
descent
intimacy
with
a
priest
was
flattering
to
the
jewish
official
in
it
he
tasted
without
actually
acknowledging
it
to
himself
the
pride
of
revenge
to
browbeat
to
patronise
one
of
those
tonsured
heads
entrusted
for
eighteen
centuries
both
by
heaven
and
earth
with
the
excommunication
and
extermination
of
the
circumcised
was
for
the
jew
a
keen
and
flattering
success
and
besides
this
dirty
threadbare
yet
respected
cassock
that
bowed
before
him
entered
châteaux
where
the
was
not
received
the
aristocratic
women
of
the
department
revered
this
garb
now
humiliated
before
the
official
uniform
deference
from
one
of
the
clergy
was
almost
equivalent
to
deference
from
that
rural
nobility
that
had
not
completely
come
over
and
of
whose
scornful
coldness
the
jew
though
by
no
means
sensitive
had
had
painful
experiences
guitrel
humble
yet
with
made
his
deference
appreciated
being
honoured
as
a
powerful
master
by
this
ecclesiastical
politician
the
head
of
the
department
returned
in
patronage
what
he
received
in
deference
and
flung
conciliatory
speeches
at
abbé
guitrel
doubtless
there
are
good
devoted
and
intelligent
priests
when
the
clergy
takes
its
stand
upon
its
privileges
and
abbé
guitrel
bowed
went
on
the
republic
does
not
wage
systematic
war
on
the
parish
priests
and
if
the
fraternities
had
submitted
to
the
law
many
of
their
difficulties
would
have
been
and
guitrel
protested
it
is
a
matter
of
principle
i
should
have
decided
in
favour
of
the
fraternities
it
is
also
a
matter
of
business
the
fraternities
did
a
great
deal
of
the
summed
up
from
out
of
the
cloud
of
his
harking
back
over
what
has
been
done
is
useless
but
the
new
spirit
is
a
spirit
of
and
again
guitrel
bowed
while
rondonneau
junior
bent
over
his
account
books
his
bald
head
where
the
flies
pitched
one
day
being
asked
to
give
her
opinion
about
a
vase
that
the
was
to
present
with
his
own
hand
to
the
winner
in
the
race
for
madame
came
to
rondonneau
junior
s
with
her
husband
she
found
guitrel
in
the
jeweller
s
office
he
made
a
feint
to
leave
the
place
but
they
begged
him
to
remain
they
even
consulted
him
as
to
the
nymphs
who
formed
by
their
bending
figures
the
handles
of
the
cup
the
would
have
preferred
them
to
be
amazons
amazons
doubtless
murmured
the
professor
of
sacred
rhetoric
madame
would
have
liked
centauresses
centauresses
yes
yes
said
the
priest
or
rather
meanwhile
rondonneau
junior
was
holding
up
the
wax
model
in
his
fingers
in
front
of
the
spectators
and
smiling
in
admiration
monsieur
l
abbé
asked
the
does
the
church
always
ban
the
nude
in
art
guitrel
replied
the
church
has
never
absolutely
proscribed
nude
studies
but
she
has
always
judiciously
restrained
their
madame
looked
at
the
priest
and
thought
how
remarkably
like
madame
vacherie
he
was
she
confided
to
him
that
she
had
a
passion
for
curios
that
she
was
mad
about
brocades
stamped
velvets
gold
fringes
embroidery
and
lace
she
disclosed
to
him
the
covetous
desires
accumulated
in
her
mind
since
the
days
when
she
used
to
trail
in
her
youth
and
poverty
in
front
of
the
of
the
dealers
in
the
quartier
bréda
she
told
him
that
she
had
dreams
of
a
salon
with
old
copes
and
old
chasubles
and
that
she
was
also
collecting
antique
jewels
he
answered
that
in
truth
the
ornaments
of
the
priests
provided
precious
models
for
artists
and
that
there
we
had
a
proof
that
the
church
was
no
enemy
to
art
from
that
day
forward
guitrel
began
to
hunt
in
the
country
sacristies
for
splendid
antiques
and
scarcely
a
week
passed
that
he
did
not
carry
into
rondonneau
junior
s
under
his
a
chasuble
or
a
cope
adroitly
pillaged
from
some
innocent
priest
guitrel
was
moreover
very
scrupulous
in
remitting
to
the
rifled
the
piece
with
which
the
paid
for
the
silk
the
brocade
the
velvet
and
the
lace
in
six
months
time
madame
s
had
become
like
a
cathedral
treasury
a
clinging
odour
of
incense
lingered
round
it
one
summer
day
in
that
year
guitrel
according
to
custom
mounted
the
goldsmith
s
stairs
and
found
puffing
away
merrily
in
the
shop
for
the
day
before
the
had
succeeded
in
getting
his
candidate
a
and
young
royalist
returned
and
he
was
counting
on
the
approval
of
the
minister
who
secretly
preferred
the
new
to
the
old
republicans
as
being
less
exacting
and
more
humble
in
the
elation
of
his
boisterous
satisfaction
he
slapped
the
priest
on
the
shoulder
monsieur
l
abbé
what
we
want
is
many
priests
like
you
enlightened
tolerant
free
from
you
haven
t
any
prejudices
not
you
who
recognise
the
needs
of
the
present
day
and
the
requirements
of
a
democratic
society
if
the
episcopate
if
the
french
clergy
would
only
catch
the
progressive
yet
conservative
sentiments
that
the
republic
professes
they
would
still
have
a
fine
part
to
then
amidst
the
smoke
of
his
big
cigar
he
expounded
ideas
on
religion
which
testified
to
an
ignorance
that
filled
guitrel
with
inward
dismay
the
however
declared
himself
to
be
more
christian
than
many
christians
and
in
the
language
of
the
masonic
lodge
he
extolled
the
moral
teaching
of
jesus
while
he
rejected
indiscriminately
local
superstitions
and
fundamental
dogmas
the
needles
thrown
into
the
piscina
of
saint
phal
by
marriageable
girls
and
the
real
presence
in
the
eucharist
guitrel
an
soul
but
incapable
of
yielding
a
point
as
to
dogma
stammered
out
one
must
make
a
distinction
monsieur
one
must
make
a
in
order
to
make
a
diversion
he
drew
out
from
a
pocket
of
his
a
roll
of
parchment
which
he
opened
on
the
counter
it
was
a
large
page
of
with
gothic
text
under
the
divisions
with
rubrics
and
a
decorated
initial
the
fixed
his
great
eyes
on
the
page
rondonneau
junior
stretching
out
his
rosy
bald
head
said
the
miniature
in
the
initial
is
rather
fine
it

saint
agatha
isn

it
the
martyrdom
of
saint
agatha
said
guitrel
here
are
seen
the
executioners
torturing
the
breasts
of
the
and
he
added
in
a
voice
which
flowed
as
sweetly
as
thick
syrup
according
to
authentic
records
such
was
in
fact
the
torment
inflicted
on
saint
agatha
of
blessed
memory
by
the
proconsul
a
page
from
an
antiphonary
monsieur
trifle
a
mere
trifle
which
perhaps
will
find
a
little
niche
in
the
collections
of
madame
so
devoted
to
our
christian
antiquities
this
page
gives
us
a
fragment
of
the
proper
of

he
deciphered
the
latin
text
marking
the
tonic
accent
energetically

while
the
blessed
agatha
was
being
cruelly
tortured
in
the
breast
she
said
to
the
judge
oh
wicked
cruel
and
savage
tyrant

thou
not
ashamed
to
mutilate
in
a
woman

your

i
have

to
the
who
was
a
graduate
half
understood
and
in
his
desire
to
appear
gallic
remarked
that
it
was
piquant
naïve
answered
abbé
guitrel
gently
granted
that
the
language
of
the
middle
ages
had
in
fact
a
certain
naïveté
it
has
also
sublimity
said
guitrel
but
the
was
rather
inclined
to
seek
in
church
latin
for
the
piquancy
of
broad
humour
and
it
was
with
a
sly
little
laugh
of
obstinacy
that
he
crammed
the
parchment
into
his
pocket
with
many
thanks
to
his
dear
guitrel
for
this
discovery
then
pushing
the
abbé
into
the
he
whispered
in
his
ear
my
dear
guitrel
when
the
chance
comes
i
will
do
something
for
v
there
was
one
party
in
the
town
which
openly
declared
that
abbé
lantaigne
principal
of
the
high
seminary
was
a
priest
worthy
of
a
bishopric
and
fitted
to
fill
the
vacant
see
of
tourcoing
honourably
until
the
time
when
monseigneur
charlot
s
death
should
enable
him
cross
in
hand
and
amethyst
on
finger
to
assume
the
mitre
in
the
town
that
had
witnessed
his
labours
and
his
merits
this
was
the
scheme
of
the
venerable
cassignol
in
chief
and
a
state
pensioner
of
years
standing
with
these
plans
were
associated
lerond
deputy
at
the
time
of
the
decrees

now

abbé

formerly
an
army
chaplain
and
now
chaplain
to
the
dames
du
salut
these
belonging
to
the
most
respected
but
not
to
the
most
influential
class
in
the
town
made
up
practically
the
whole
of
abbé
lantaigne
s
party
the
head
of
the
high
seminary
had
been
invited
to
dine
with
cassignol
the
chief
president
who
said
to
him
in
the
presence
of
de
lalonde
and
lerond
e
the
d
of
monsieur
l
abbé
put
yourself
forward
as
a
candidate
when
it
shall
come
to
a
choice
between
abbé
lantaigne
who
has
so
nobly
served
both
religion
and
christian
france
by
pen
and
tongue
who
has
protected
the
cause
of
the
rights
of
the
french
church
within
the
catholic
church
with
the
force
of
his
mental
endowments
and
high
character
and
guitrel
none
will
have
the
effrontery
to
hesitate
and
since
it
seems
that
this
time
the
honour
of
supplying
a
bishop
for
the
town
of
tourcoing
is
to
fall
to
our
city
the
faithful
of
the
diocese
are
willing
to
lose
you
for
a
time
for
the
good
of
the
episcopate
as
well
as
of
and
the
venerable
cassignol
who
was
now
in
his
year
added
with
a
smile
we
shall
see
you
again
i
have
a
firm
conviction
of
that
you
will
come
back
to
us
from
tourcoing
monsieur
l
abbé
lantaigne
had
replied
monsieur
with
no
intention
of
anticipating
any
honour
i
yet
shall
shirk
no
he
yearned
and
longed
for
the
see
of
the
lamented
monseigneur
duclou
but
this
priest
whose
ambition
was
frozen
by
his
pride
was
waiting
until
they
came
to
bring
him
the
mitre
one
morning
lerond
came
to
see
him
at
the
seminary
and
brought
news
of
how
abbé
guitrel
s
candidature
was
progressing
at
the
ministry
of
public
worship
it
was
suspected
that
was
working
hard
in
favour
of
guitrel
in
the
offices
of
the
ministry
where
all
the
freemasons
had
already
received
their
orders
this
was
what
he
had
been
told
at
the
offices
of
the
religious
and
moderate
paper
of
the
district
with
regard
to
the
intentions
of
the
nothing
was
known
the
truth
was
that
monseigneur
charlot
dared
neither
oppose
nor
support
any
candidate
his
characteristic
caution
had
been
growing
on
him
for
years
if
he
had
any
preferences
he
let
no
one
guess
them
for
a
long
time
he
had
been
comfortably
and
pleasurably
concealing
his
policy
just
as
he
played
his
game
of
bezique
every
evening
with
de
goulet
and
in
fact
the
promotion
of
a
priest
of
his
diocese
to
a
bishopric
was
in
no
way
an
affair
of
his
but
he
was
forced
to
take
part
in
this
intrigue
the
whom
he
did
not
wish
to
offend
had
caused
him
to
be
sounded
his
eminence
could
not
be
ignorant
of
the
shrewd
and
urbane
disposition
of
which
guitrel
had
given
plain
proofs
in
the
diocese
on
the
other
hand
he
believed
this
guitrel
to
be
capable
of
anything
who
knows
thought
he
whether
he
is
not
scheming
to
get
himself
appointed
here
as
my
coadjutor
instead
of
going
to
that
gloomy
little
metropolis
of
northern
gaul
and
if
i
declare
him
worthy
of
a
bishopric
will
it
not
be
believed
that
i
intend
him
to
share
my
see
this
apprehension
that
he
would
be
given
a
coadjutor
embittered
monseigneur
charlot
s
old
age
in
abbé
lantaigne
s
case
he
had
strong
reasons
for
being
silent
and
holding
aloof
he
would
not
have
supported
this
priest
s
candidature
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
foresaw
its
failure
monseigneur
charlot
never
willingly
put
himself
on
the
losing
side
moreover
he
loathed
the
principal
of
the
high
seminary
yet
this
hatred
in
a
mind
so
and
kindly
as
monseigneur
s
was
not
actually
prejudicial
to
lantaigne
s
ambitions
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
monseigneur
charlot
would
have
consented
to
his
becoming
either
bishop
or
pope
lantaigne
had
a
high
reputation
for
piety
learning
and
eloquence
one
could
not
without
a
certain
shamelessness
be
openly
against
him
now
monseigneur
charlot
being
popular
and
very
keen
to
gain
every
one
s
goodwill
did
not
despise
the
opinion
of
honourable
men
lerond
was
unable
to
follow
the
secret
thoughts
of
monseigneur
but
he
knew
that
the
archbishop
had
not
yet
committed
himself
he
judged
that
it
might
be
possible
to
bring
influence
to
bear
on
the
old
man
s
mind
and
that
an
appeal
to
his
pastoral
instincts
might
not
be
in
vain
he
urged
lantaigne
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
archbishop
s
palace
you
will
beg
his
eminence
with
filial
deference
for
advice
in
the
probable
event
of
the
bishopric
of
tourcoing
being
offered
to
you
it
is
the
right
step
and
it
will
produce
an
excellent
lantaigne
objected
it
behoves
me
to
wait
for
a
more
solemn
what
call
could
be
more
solemn
than
the
suffrages
of
so
many
zealous
christians
who
hail
your
name
with
a
unanimity
that
recalls
the
ancient
popular
acclamations
with
which
a
médard
and
a
remi
were
greeted
but
monsieur
answered
honest
lantaigne
those
acclamations
in
the
obsolete
custom
to
which
you
refer
came
from
the
faithful
of
the
diocese
which
these
holy
men
were
called
upon
to
govern
and
i
am
not
aware
that
the
catholics
of
tourcoing
have
acclaimed
at
this
point
lawyer
lerond
said
what
had
to
be
said
if
you
do
not
bar
the
road
for
him
guitrel
will
become
a
the
next
day
lantaigne
had
fastened
over
his
shoulders
his
visiting
cloak
the
wing
of
which
flapped
on
his
sturdy
back
the
while
on
the
road
to
the
archbishop
s
palace
he
besought
his
god
to
spare
the
church
of
france
an
unmerited
disgrace
his
eminence
at
the
moment
when
lantaigne
bowed
before
him
had
just
received
a
letter
from
the
nunciature
asking
him
for
a
confidential
note
about
guitrel
the
nuncio
made
no
secret
of
his
liking
for
a
priest
reputed
to
be
intelligent
and
zealous
and
capable
of
being
useful
in
negotiations
with
the
temporal
power
his
eminence
had
immediately
dictated
to
de
goulet
a
note
in
favour
of
the
nuncio
s
protégé
he
exclaimed
in
his
pleasant
tremulous
voice
monsieur
lantaigne
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
monseigneur
i
have
come
to
ask
your
eminence
for
your
paternal
counsel
in
case
the
holy
father
regarding
me
with
favour
should
nominate
me
very
happy
to
see
you
monsieur
lantaigne
you
come
just
in
the
nick
of
time
i
would
venture
if
your
eminence
did
not
deem
me
unworthy
of
you
are
monsieur
lantaigne
an
eminent
theologian
and
a
priest
of
the
highest
possible
learning
in
the
canon
law
you
are
an
authority
on
knotty
points
of
discipline
your
advice
is
precious
on
questions
of
the
liturgy
and
in
general
on
any
point
that
concerns
religion
if
you
had
not
come
i
was
going
to
send
for
you
as
de
goulet
can
tell
you
at
the
present
moment
i
am
in
great
need
of
your
and
monseigneur
with
his
gouty
hand
well
practised
in
benediction
waved
the
principal
of
the
high
seminary
to
a
seat
monsieur
lantaigne
be
kind
enough
to
listen
to
me
the
venerable
laprune
the
curé
of
is
just
gone
from
here
i
must
tell
you
that
this
poor
curé
has
this
morning
found
a
man
hanged
in
his
church
just
conceive
his
distress
he
is
beside
himself
and
in
such
a
crisis
i
myself
need
to
take
the
advice
of
the
most
learned
priest
in
my
diocese
what
ought
we
to
do
tell
me
lantaigne
collected
himself
for
a
moment
then
in
the
tone
of
a
pedagogue
he
began
to
expound
the
traditions
concerning
the
purification
of
churches
the
maccabees
after
having
washed
the
temple
profaned
by
antiochus
epiphanes
in
the
year
before
the
incarnation
celebrated
its
dedication
that
is
the
origin
monseigneur
of
the
festival
called
is
to
say
renewal
in
fact
and
he
developed
his
ideas
monseigneur
listened
with
an
air
of
admiration
and
lantaigne
drew
up
from
his
inexhaustible
memory
endless
texts
relating
to
the
ceremonies
of
purification
precedents
arguments
commentaries
john
chapter
verse
the
roman
pontifical
the
venerable
bede
baronius
he
spoke
for
of
an
hour
after
this
the
replied
it
should
be
noted
that
the
hanged
man
was
found
in
the
porch
of
the
side
door
on
the
epistle
was
the
inner
door
of
the
porch
closed
asked
lantaigne
alas
alas
answered
monseigneur
it
was
not
wide
open
but
neither
was
it
completely
ajar
monseigneur
that
s
it
and
the
suicide
monseigneur
was
within
the
space
covered
by
the
porch
that
is
a
point
which
it
is
materially
important
to
ascertain
your
eminence
perceives
the
whole
importance
of
that
assuredly
monsieur
lantaigne
monsieur
de
goulet
was
there
not
one
arm
of
the
hanged
man
which
projected
from
the
porch
and
jutted
into
the
church
de
goulet
replied
with
a
blush
and
some
incoherent
syllables
i
feel
certain
replied
monseigneur
that
the
arm
went
beyond
or
at
any
rate
part
of
the
lantaigne
concluded
from
this
that
the
church
of
was
profaned
he
quoted
precedents
and
described
the
proceedings
after
the
dastardly
assassination
of
the
archbishop
of
paris
in
the
church
of
he
travelled
up
the
ages
passed
through
the
revolution
when
the
churches
were
transformed
into
armouries
referred
to
thomas
becket
and
the
impious
heliodorus
what
scholarship
what
sound
doctrine
said
monseigneur
he
rose
and
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
priest
to
kiss
it
is
a
priceless
service
that
you
have
rendered
me
monsieur
lantaigne
be
assured
that
i
have
a
great
esteem
for
your
scholarship
and
accept
my
pastoral
benediction
and
lantaigne
dismissed
perceived
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
say
a
single
word
about
the
important
business
on
which
he
had
come
but
with
the
echoes
of
his
own
words
all
round
him
full
of
his
learning
and
his
application
of
it
and
much
flattered
he
descended
the
grand
staircase
still
turning
over
in
his
own
mind
the
matter
of
the
suicide
of
and
the
urgent
need
for
the
purification
of
the
parish
church
outside
he
was
still
thinking
of
it
as
he
was
descending
the
winding
street
of
the
tintelleries
he
met
the
curé
of
the
venerable
laprune
who
standing
in
front
of
cooper
lenfant
s
shop
was
examining
the
corks
his
wine
had
been
turning
sour
and
this
deterioration
he
attributed
to
the
defective
way
in
which
his
bottles
were
corked
it
is
deplorable
he
murmured
deplorable
and
your
suicide
demanded
abbé
lantaigne
at
this
question
the
worthy
curé
of
opened
his
full
round
eyes
and
asked
in
astonishment
what
suicide
the
man
who
hanged
himself
in
the
miserable
suicide
whom
you
found
this
morning
in
the
porch
of
your
laprune
terrified
wondering
from
what
he
had
just
heard
whether
he
or
lantaigne
had
gone
mad
replied
that
he
had
found
no
one
hanged
what
replied
lantaigne
surprised
in
his
turn
wasn
t
a
man
found
this
morning
hanged
in
the
porch
of
a
door
on
the
epistle
side
in
sign
of
denial
the
vicar
twice
revolved
on
his
shoulders
a
face
whereon
shone
the
sacred
truth
abbé
lantaigne
now
looked
like
a
man
taken
with
giddiness
but
it
was
the
who
has
just
told
me
himself
that
you
found
a
man
hanged
in
your
church
oh
replied
laprune
suddenly
reassured
monseigneur
wanted
to
amuse
himself
he
loves
a
jest
he
is
a
capital
hand
at
it
and
knows
how
to
keep
within
the
bounds
of
seemliness
he
has
so
much
wit
but
abbé
lantaigne
raising
heavenwards
his
fiery
sombre
glance
exclaimed
the
archbishop
has
deceived
me
this
man
will
then
never
speak
the
truth
save
when
on
the
steps
of
the
altar
taking
the
consecrated
host
in
his
hands
he
pronounces
the
words
non
sum
vi
now
that
he
was
no
longer
inclined
to
the
saddle
and
liked
to
keep
his
room
general
cartier
de
chalmot
had
reduced
his
division
to
cards
in
small
cardboard
boxes
which
he
placed
every
morning
on
his
desk
and
which
he
arranged
every
evening
on
the
white
deal
shelves
above
his
iron
bedstead
he
marshalled
his
cards
day
by
day
with
scrupulous
exactitude
in
an
order
which
filled
him
with
satisfaction
every
card
represented
a
man
the
symbol
by
which
he
henceforth
thought
of
his
officers
officers
and
men
satisfied
his
craving
for
method
and
suited
his
natural
bent
of
mind
cartier
de
chalmot
had
always
been
noted
as
an
excellent
officer
general
parroy
under
whom
he
had
served
said
of
him
in
captain
de
chalmot
the
capacity
for
obedience
is
exactly
balanced
by
the
power
of
command
a
rare
and
priceless
quality
of
the
true
military
cartier
de
chalmot
had
always
been
scrupulous
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
being
upright
diffident
and
an
excellent
penman
he
had
at
last
hit
upon
a
system
which
fitted
in
with
his
abilities
and
in
command
of
his
division
of
cards
he
applied
his
method
with
the
utmost
vigour
on
this
particular
day
having
risen
according
to
his
custom
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
had
passed
from
his
tub
to
his
and
whilst
the
sun
was
mounting
with
solemn
slowness
above
the
elms
of
the
archbishop
s
palace
the
general
was
organising
manœuvres
by
manipulating
the
boxes
of
cards
that
symbolised
reality
and
that
were
actually
identical
with
reality
to
an
intelligence
which
like
his
was
excessively
reverent
towards
everything
symbolic
for
more
than
three
hours
he
had
been
poring
over
his
cards
with
a
mind
and
face
as
wan
and
melancholy
as
the
cards
themselves
when
his
servant
announced
the
abbé
de
lalonde
then
he
took
off
his
glasses
wiped
his
eyes
rose
and
half
smiling
turned
towards
the
door
a
countenance
which
had
once
been
handsome
and
which
in
old
age
remained
quite
simple
in
its
lineaments
he
stretched
out
to
the
visitor
who
entered
a
large
hand
the
palm
of
which
had
scarcely
any
lines
and
said
to
the
priest
in
a
gruff
yet
hesitating
voice
which
revealed
at
the
same
time
the
diffidence
of
the
man
and
the
infallibility
of
the
commander
my
dear
abbé
how
are
you
i
am
very
glad
to
see
and
he
pushed
forward
to
him
one
of
the
two
horsehair
chairs
which
with
the
desk
and
the
bed
comprised
all
the
furniture
of
this
clean
bright
empty
room
the
abbé
sat
down
he
was
a
wonderfully
active
little
old
man
in
his
face
of
crumbling
brick
there
were
set
like
two
jewels
the
blue
eyes
of
a
child
they
looked
at
one
another
for
a
moment
understandingly
without
saying
a
word
they
were
two
old
friends
two
formerly
a
chaplain
in
the
army
abbé
de
lalonde
was
now
chaplain
to
the
dames
du
salut
as
military
chaplain
he
had
been
attached
to
the
regiment
of
guards
of
which
cartier
de
chalmot
had
been
colonel
in
and
which
forming
part
of
the
division
had
been
shut
up
in
metz
with
bazaine
s
army
the
memory
of
these
homeric
yet
lamentable
weeks
came
back
to
the
minds
of
these
two
friends
every
time
they
saw
one
another
and
every
time
they
made
the
same
remarks
this
time
the
chaplain
began
do
you
remember
general
when
we
were
in
metz
running
short
of
medicine
of
fodder
running
short
of
salt
abbé
de
lalonde
was
the
least
sensual
of
men
he
had
hardly
felt
the
want
of
salt
for
himself
but
he
had
suffered
much
at
not
being
able
to
give
the
men
salt
as
he
gave
them
tobacco
in
little
packets
carefully
wrapped
up
and
he
remembered
this
cruel
privation
ah
general
the
salt
ran
short
general
cartier
de
chalmot
replied
they
made
up
for
it
to
a
certain
extent
by
mixing
gunpowder
with
the
all
the
same
answered
the
chaplain
war
is
a
terrible
thus
spoke
this
innocent
friend
of
soldiers
in
the
sincerity
of
his
heart
but
the
general
did
not
acquiesce
in
this
condemnation
of
war
pardon
me
my
dear
abbé
war
is
of
course
a
cruel
necessity
but
one
which
provides
for
officers
and
men
an
opportunity
of
showing
the
highest
qualities
without
war
we
should
still
be
ignorant
of
how
far
the
courage
and
endurance
of
men
can
and
very
seriously
he
added
the
bible
proves
the
lawfulness
of
war
and
you
know
better
than
i
how
in
it
god
is
called
is
the
god
of
the
abbé
smiled
with
an
expression
of
frank
roguishness
displaying
the
three
very
white
teeth
which
were
all
that
remained
to
him
pooh
i
don
t
know
hebrew
not
i
and
god
has
so
many
more
beautiful
names
that
i
can
dispense
with
calling
him
by
that
one
alas
general
what
a
splendid
army
perished
under
the
command
of
that
unhappy
marshal
at
these
words
general
cartier
de
chalmot
began
to
say
what
he
had
already
said
a
hundred
times
bazaine
listen
to
me
neglect
of
the
regulations
touching
fortified
towns
culpable
hesitation
in
giving
orders
mental
reservations
before
the
enemy
and
before
the
enemy
one
ought
to
have
no
mental
reservations
capitulation
in
open
country
he
deserved
his
fate
and
then
a
scapegoat
was
for
my
part
answered
the
chaplain
i
should
beware
of
ever
saying
a
single
word
which
might
injure
the
memory
of
this
unfortunate
marshal
i
can
not
judge
his
actions
and
it
is
certainly
not
my
business
to
noise
abroad
even
his
indubitable
shortcomings
for
he
granted
me
a
favour
for
which
i
shall
feel
grateful
as
long
as
i
a
favour
demanded
the
general
he
to
you
oh
a
favour
so
noble
so
beautiful
he
granted
me
a
pardon
for
a
poor
soldier
a
dragoon
condemned
to
death
for
insubordination
in
memory
of
this
favour
every
year
i
say
a
mass
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
but
general
cartier
de
chalmot
would
not
let
himself
be
turned
from
the
point
capitulation
in
open
country
just
imagine
it
he
deserved
his
and
in
order
to
hearten
himself
up
the
general
spoke
of
canrobert
and
of
the
splendid
stand
of
the
brigade
at
and
the
chaplain
related
anecdotes
of
a
diverting
kind
with
an
edifying
climax
ah
general
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
a
great
rascal
of
a
carabineer
came
to
look
for
me
i
see
him
still
all
blackened
in
a
sheepskin
he
cries
to
me
s
going
to
be
warm
work
i
may
leave
my
bones
to
rot
there
confess
me
monsieur
le
curé
and
quickly
i
must
go
and
groom
my
little
i
say
to
him
i
don
t
want
to
delay
you
friend
still
you
must
tell
me
your
sins
what
are
your
sins
in
astonishment
he
looks
at
me
and
replies
why
all
what
all
yes
all
i
have
committed
all
the
i
shake
my
head
all
my
is
a
good
many
tell
me
hast
thou
beaten
thy
mother
at
this
question
my
gentleman
grows
excited
waves
his
great
arms
swears
like
a
pagan
and
exclaims
monsieur
le
curé
you
are
mocking
me
i
reply
to
him
calm
yourself
friend
you
see
now
that
you
have
not
committed
all
the
thus
the
chaplain
cheerily
narrated
pious
regimental
anecdotes
and
then
he
deduced
the
moral
from
them
good
christians
made
good
soldiers
it
was
a
mistake
to
banish
religion
from
the
army
general
cartier
de
chalmot
approved
of
these
maxims
i
have
always
said
so
my
dear
abbé
in
destroying
mystical
beliefs
you
ruin
the
military
spirit
by
what
right
do
you
exact
of
a
man
the
sacrifice
of
his
life
if
you
take
away
from
him
the
hope
of
another
existence
and
the
chaplain
answered
with
a
smile
full
of
kindliness
innocence
and
joy
you
will
see
that
there
will
be
a
return
to
religion
they
are
already
going
back
to
it
on
all
sides
men
are
not
as
bad
as
they
appear
and
god
is
infinitely
then
at
last
he
revealed
the
object
of
his
visit
i
come
general
to
ask
a
great
favour
of
general
cartier
de
chalmot
became
attentive
his
face
already
sad
grew
sadder
still
he
loved
and
respected
this
old
chaplain
and
would
have
wished
to
give
him
pleasure
but
the
very
idea
of
granting
a
favour
was
alarming
to
his
strict
uprightness
yes
general
i
come
to
ask
you
to
work
for
the
good
of
the
church
you
know
abbé
lantaigne
head
of
the
high
seminary
in
our
town
he
is
a
priest
renowned
for
his
piety
and
learning
a
great
i
have
met
abbé
lantaigne
several
times
he
made
a
favourable
impression
on
me
but
oh
general
if
you
had
heard
his
lectures
as
i
have
done
you
would
be
amazed
at
his
learning
yet
i
was
able
to
appreciate
but
a
trifling
part
of
it
thirty
years
of
my
life
i
have
spent
in
reminding
poor
soldiers
stretched
on
a
hospital
bed
of
the
goodness
of
god
i
have
slipped
in
a
good
word
along
with
a
screw
of
tobacco
for
another
years
i
have
been
confessing
holy
maidens
full
of
sanctity
of
course
but
less
charming
in
character
than
were
my
soldiers
i
have
never
had
the
time
to
read
the
fathers
i
have
neither
enough
brain
nor
enough
theology
to
appreciate
l
abbé
lantaigne
at
his
true
worth
for
he
is
a
walking
encyclopedia
but
at
least
i
can
assure
you
general
that
he
speaks
as
he
acts
and
he
acts
as
he
and
the
old
chaplain
winking
his
eye
roguishly
added
all
ecclesiastics
unfortunately
are
not
of
this
nor
are
all
soldiers
said
the
general
smiling
a
very
wan
smile
and
the
two
men
exchanged
a
sympathetic
glance
in
their
common
hatred
of
intrigue
and
falsity
abbé
de
lalonde
who
was
however
capable
of
a
little
guile
wound
up
his
eulogy
of
abbé
lantaigne
with
this
touch
he
is
an
excellent
priest
and
if
he
had
been
a
soldier
he
would
have
made
an
excellent
but
the
general
demanded
brusquely
well
what
can
i
do
for
him
help
him
to
slip
on
the
violet
stockings
which
he
has
richly
deserved
general
he
is
an
admitted
candidate
for
the
vacant
bishopric
of
tourcoing
i
beg
you
to
support
him
with
the
minister
of
justice
and
religion
whom
i
am
told
you
know
the
general
shook
his
head
in
fact
he
had
never
asked
anything
of
the
government
cartier
de
chalmot
as
a
royalist
and
a
christian
regarded
the
republic
with
a
disapproval
that
was
complete
silent
and
reading
no
newspapers
and
talking
with
no
one
he
undervalued
on
principle
a
civil
power
of
whose
doings
he
knew
nothing
he
obeyed
and
held
his
tongue
he
was
admired
in
the
châteaux
of
the
neighbourhood
for
his
melancholy
resignation
inspired
by
the
sentiment
of
duty
strengthened
by
a
profound
scorn
for
everything
which
was
not
military
intensified
by
a
growing
difficulty
in
thought
and
speech
rendered
obvious
and
affecting
by
the
progress
of
an
affection
of
the
liver
it
was
well
known
that
general
cartier
de
chalmot
remained
a
faithful
royalist
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
it
was
not
so
well
known
that
one
day
in
the
year
his
heart
had
received
one
of
those
shocks
which
can
only
be
compared
with
what
christians
describe
as
the
workings
of
grace
and
which
bring
with
the
force
of
a
thunderbolt
deep
and
peace
to
a
man
s
innermost
being
this
event
took
place
at
five
o
clock
in
the
evening
of
the
of
june
in
the
of
the
prefecture
there
among
the
flowers
that
madame
had
herself
arranged
president
carnot
on
his
way
through
the
town
had
received
the
officers
of
the
garrison
general
cartier
de
chalmot
being
present
with
his
staff
saw
the
president
for
the
first
time
and
instantly
for
no
apparent
reason
on
no
explicable
grounds
was
pierced
through
and
through
by
a
terrible
admiration
in
a
second
before
the
gentle
gravity
and
honest
inflexibility
of
the
head
of
the
state
all
his
prejudices
fell
away
he
forgot
that
this
sovereign
was
a
civilian
he
revered
and
loved
him
he
suddenly
felt
himself
bound
with
ties
of
sympathy
and
respect
to
this
man
sad
and
sallow
like
himself
but
august
and
serene
like
a
ruler
he
uttered
with
a
soldierly
stutter
the
official
compliment
which
he
had
learnt
by
heart
the
president
answered
him
i
thank
you
in
the
name
of
the
republic
and
of
our
country
which
you
loyally
at
this
all
the
devotion
to
an
absent
prince
which
general
cartier
de
chalmot
had
stored
up
for
years
welled
forth
from
his
heart
towards
the
president
whose
quiet
face
remained
surprisingly
immobile
and
who
spoke
in
a
melancholy
voice
with
no
movement
of
cheek
or
lips
on
which
his
black
beard
set
a
seal
on
this
waxen
face
in
these
slow
honest
eyes
on
this
feeble
breast
across
which
blazed
the
broad
red
ribbon
of
his
order
in
the
whole
figure
of
this
suffering
automaton
the
general
perceived
both
the
dignity
of
the
leader
and
the
affliction
of
the
man
who
has
never
laughed
with
his
admiration
there
was
mingled
a
strain
of
tenderness
a
year
later
he
heard
of
the
tragic
end
of
this
president
for
whose
safety
he
would
willingly
have
died
and
whom
he
henceforth
pictured
in
his
thoughts
as
dark
and
stiff
like
the
flag
rolled
round
its
staff
in
the
barracks
and
covered
with
its
case
from
that
time
he
had
ignored
the
civil
rulers
of
france
he
cared
to
know
nothing
save
of
his
military
superiors
whom
he
obeyed
with
melancholy
punctiliousness
pained
at
the
idea
of
answering
the
venerable
abbé
de
lalonde
by
a
refusal
he
bethought
himself
for
a
moment
and
then
gave
his
reasons
a
matter
of
principle
i
never
ask
anything
of
the
government
you
agree
with
me
don
t
you
for
from
the
moment
that
one
lays
down
a
rule
for
oneself
the
chaplain
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
sadness
that
seemed
as
though
thrown
over
his
happy
old
face
oh
how
could
i
agree
with
you
who
beg
of
everybody
i
am
a
hardened
beggar
for
god
and
the
poor
i
have
pleaded
with
all
the
powers
of
the
day
with
king
louis
philippe
s
ministers
with
those
of
the
provisional
government
with
napoleon
s
ministers
with
those
of
the
and
those
of
the
present
republic
they
have
all
helped
me
to
do
some
good
and
since
you
know
the
minister
of
religion
at
this
moment
a
shrill
voice
called
in
the
passage
poulot
poulot
and
a
stout
lady
in
a
morning
wrapper
her
white
hair
crowned
with
entered
the
room
with
a
rush
it
was
madame
cartier
de
chalmot
who
was
calling
the
general
to
déjeuner
she
had
already
shaken
her
husband
with
imperious
tenderness
and
exclaimed
once
more
poulot
before
she
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
old
priest
crushed
up
against
the
door
she
apologised
for
her
untidy
dress
she
had
had
so
much
to
do
this
morning
three
daughters
two
sons
an
orphan
nephew
and
her
children
to
look
after
ah
madame
said
the
abbé
it
is
god
himself
who
has
sent
you
you
will
be
my
your
providence
monsieur
l
abbé
in
her
grey
her
figure
revealed
the
ample
dignity
of
classic
motherhood
on
her
beaming
moustachioed
face
shone
a
matronly
pride
her
large
gestures
expressed
at
once
the
briskness
of
a
housewife
habituated
to
work
and
the
ease
of
a
woman
accustomed
to
official
deference
the
general
disappeared
behind
her
she
was
his
household
goddess
and
his
guardian
angel
this
pauline
who
carried
on
her
brave
energetic
shoulders
all
the
burden
of
this
ostentatious
house
who
played
the
part
of
seamstress
to
the
family
as
well
as
cook
dressmaker
chambermaid
governess
apothecary
and
even
milliner
with
a
frankly
gaudy
taste
and
yet
showed
at
big
dinners
and
receptions
an
imperturbable
good
breeding
a
commanding
profile
and
shoulders
that
were
still
beautiful
it
was
commonly
said
in
the
division
that
if
the
general
became
minister
of
war
his
wife
would
do
the
honours
of
the
hôtel
in
the
boulevard
f
in
capital
fashion
f
where
the
french
war
office
is
situated
the
energy
of
the
general
s
wife
spread
freely
over
into
the
outer
world
and
flourished
vigorously
in
pious
and
charitable
works
madame
cartier
de
chalmot
was
lady
patroness
of
three
crêches
and
a
dozen
charities
recommended
by
the
monseigneur
charlot
showed
a
special
predilection
for
this
lady
and
said
to
her
sometimes
with
his
smile
you
are
a
general
in
the
army
of
christian
and
being
a
professor
of
orthodoxy
monseigneur
charlot
never
failed
to
add
and
there
is
no
charity
outside
the
christian
charity
for
the
church
alone
is
in
a
position
to
solve
the
social
problems
whose
difficulties
perplex
the
minds
of
all
and
cause
special
anxiety
to
our
paternal
this
was
just
what
madame
cartier
de
chalmot
thought
she
was
lavishly
glaringly
pious
and
not
free
from
the
rather
loud
magnificence
that
was
aptly
accented
by
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
the
flowers
in
her
hats
her
faith
voluminous
and
decorative
like
the
bosom
which
enshrined
it
made
a
splendid
show
in
by
the
breadth
of
her
religious
sentiments
she
had
done
much
harm
to
her
husband
but
neither
of
them
paid
any
heed
to
this
the
general
also
believed
in
the
christian
creed
although
this
would
not
have
prevented
him
from
having
the
arrested
on
a
written
order
from
the
minister
of
war
yet
he
was
regarded
with
suspicion
by
the
democracy
and
the
himself
though
little
of
a
fanatic
regarded
general
cartier
de
chalmot
as
a
dangerous
man
this
was
his
wife
s
fault
she
was
ambitious
but
the
soul
of
honour
and
incapable
of
betraying
her
god
how
can
i
be
your
providence
monsieur
l
abbé
and
when
she
heard
that
the
point
at
issue
was
the
raising
to
the
bishopric
of
tourcoing
of
abbé
lantaigne
a
man
of
such
noble
steadfast
piety
she
caught
fire
and
showed
her
courage
those
are
the
bishops
we
want
lantaigne
ought
to
be
the
old
chaplain
began
to
make
use
of
this
happy
valiancy
then
madame
induce
the
general
to
write
to
the
minister
of
religion
who
turns
out
to
be
his
she
shook
the
crown
of
curlers
on
her
head
vigorously
no
monsieur
l
abbé
my
husband
will
not
write
it
is
useless
to
persist
he
thinks
that
a
soldier
ought
never
to
ask
for
anything
he
is
right
my
father
was
of
this
opinion
you
knew
him
monsieur
l
abbé
and
you
know
that
he
was
a
fine
man
and
a
good
the
old
army
chaplain
smote
his
forehead
colonel
de
balny
yes
of
course
i
knew
him
he
was
a
hero
and
a
general
cartier
de
chalmot
interposed
my
colonel
de
balny
was
chiefly
commendable
for
having
mastered
in
their
entirety
the
regulations
of
on
cavalry
manœuvres
these
regulations
were
so
complicated
that
few
officers
mastered
them
in
their
completeness
they
were
afterwards
withdrawn
and
colonel
de
balny
conceived
such
a
disgust
at
this
that
it
hastened
his
end
new
regulations
were
imposed
possessing
the
unquestionable
advantage
of
simplification
yet
i
question
whether
the
old
state
of
things
was
not
preferable
you
must
exact
much
from
a
cavalryman
in
order
to
get
a
little
out
of
him
it
is
the
same
with
the
and
the
general
began
anxiously
to
manipulate
his
division
of
cards
drawn
up
in
the
boxes
madame
cartier
de
chalmot
had
heard
these
same
words
very
often
she
always
made
the
same
reply
to
them
once
more
this
time
she
said
poulot
how
can
you
say
that
papa
died
of
chagrin
when
he
fell
down
in
an
apoplectic
fit
at
a
review
the
old
chaplain
by
a
crafty
wile
brought
the
conversation
back
to
the
subject
which
interested
him
ah
madame
your
excellent
father
colonel
de
balny
would
have
certainly
appreciated
the
character
of
lantaigne
and
he
would
have
offered
up
prayers
that
this
priest
might
be
raised
to
a
i
also
monsieur
l
abbé
will
offer
up
prayers
for
that
answered
the
general
s
wife
my
husband
can
not
ought
not
to
make
any
application
but
if
you
think
that
my
intervention
will
be
useful
i
will
drop
a
word
to
monseigneur
he
doesn
t
terrify
me
at
all
our
doubtless
a
word
from
your
mouth
murmured
the
old
man
the
ear
of
monseigneur
chariot
will
be
open
to
the
general
s
wife
announced
that
she
would
be
seeing
the
archbishop
at
the
inauguration
of
the
pain
de
saint
antoine
of
which
she
was
president
and
that
there
she
interrupted
herself
the
cutlets
excuse
me
monsieur
l
abbé
she
rushed
out
on
to
the
landing
and
shouted
orders
to
the
cook
from
the
staircase
then
she
reappeared
in
the
room
and
there
i
shall
draw
him
aside
and
beg
him
to
speak
to
the
nuncio
in
favour
of
lantaigne
is
that
the
right
way
to
go
to
work
the
old
chaplain
made
as
if
to
take
her
hands
yet
without
actually
doing
so
that
s
just
the
way
madame
i
am
sure
that
the
good
saint
anthony
of
padua
will
be
with
you
and
will
help
you
to
persuade
monseigneur
charlot
he
is
a
great
saint
i
mean
saint
anthony
ladies
ought
not
to
believe
that
he
devotes
himself
exclusively
to
finding
the
jewels
which
they
have
lost
in
heaven
he
has
something
better
to
do
to
beg
him
for
bread
for
the
poor
that
is
assuredly
far
worthier
you
have
realised
that
dear
madame
the
pain
de
saint
antoine
is
a
fine
work
i
must
inform
myself
more
fully
about
it
but
i
shall
take
good
care
not
to
breathe
a
word
of
it
to
my
good
he
was
referring
to
the
dames
du
salut
to
whom
he
was
chaplain
they
have
already
too
many
undertakings
they
are
excellent
sisters
but
too
much
absorbed
in
trifling
duties
and
far
too
petty
the
poor
he
sighed
recalling
the
time
when
he
was
a
regimental
chaplain
the
tragic
days
of
the
war
when
he
accompanied
the
wounded
stretched
out
on
an
ambulance
litter
and
gave
them
a
drop
of
brandy
for
it
was
by
doles
of
tobacco
and
spirits
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
carrying
on
his
apostolic
labours
he
again
gave
way
to
his
love
of
talking
about
the
fighting
round
metz
and
told
some
anecdotes
he
had
several
concerning
a
certain
sapper
a
native
of
lorraine
called
larmoise
a
man
full
of
resources
i
did
not
tell
you
general
how
this
great
devil
of
a
sapper
used
to
bring
me
a
bag
of
potatoes
every
morning
one
day
i
asked
him
where
he
picked
them
up
says
he
in
the
enemy
s
you
villain
i
say
to
him
thereupon
he
explains
to
me
how
he
has
found
some
among
the
german
guards
yes
fellows
from
home
we
are
only
separated
by
the
frontier
we
embraced
one
another
we
talked
about
our
relatives
and
friends
and
they
said
to
me
you
can
take
as
many
potatoes
as
you
and
the
chaplain
added
this
simple
incident
made
me
feel
better
than
any
reasoning
how
cruel
and
unjust
war
yes
said
the
general
these
annoying
intimacies
occasionally
occur
at
the
points
of
contact
of
two
armies
they
must
be
sternly
repressed
having
due
regard
of
course
to
the
vii
on
the
promenade
along
the
ramparts
that
evening
abbé
lantaigne
head
of
the
high
seminary
fell
in
with
bergeret
a
professor
of
literature
who
was
considered
a
man
of
remarkable
but
eccentric
character
lantaigne
forgave
him
his
scepticism
and
chatted
with
him
willingly
whenever
he
met
him
under
the
on
the
mall
on
his
side
bergeret
had
no
objection
to
studying
the
mind
of
an
intelligent
priest
they
both
knew
that
their
conversations
on
a
seat
in
the
promenade
were
equally
displeasing
to
the
dean
of
the
faculty
and
to
the
archbishop
but
abbé
lantaigne
knew
nothing
about
worldly
prudence
and
bergeret
very
weary
discouraged
and
disillusioned
had
given
up
caring
for
fruitless
considerations
of
policy
sceptical
within
the
bounds
of
decorum
and
good
taste
the
assiduous
devotions
of
his
wife
and
the
endless
catechisms
of
his
daughters
had
resulted
in
his
being
impeached
of
clericalism
in
the
ministerial
bureaux
whilst
certain
speeches
that
had
been
attributed
to
him
were
used
against
him
both
by
professing
catholics
and
professional
patriots
foiled
in
his
ambitions
he
still
meant
to
live
in
his
own
way
and
having
failed
to
learn
how
to
please
tried
discreetly
to
displease
on
this
peaceful
and
radiant
evening
bergeret
seeing
the
head
of
the
high
seminary
coming
along
his
usual
road
advanced
several
paces
to
meet
the
priest
and
joined
him
under
the
first
on
the
mall
to
me
the
place
is
happy
where
i
meet
you
said
abbé
lantaigne
who
loved
before
a
university
man
to
air
his
harmless
literary
affectations
in
a
few
very
vague
phrases
they
made
a
mutual
confession
of
the
great
pity
aroused
in
them
both
by
the
world
in
which
they
lived
it
was
abbé
lantaigne
alone
who
deplored
the
decay
of
this
ancient
city
so
rich
during
the
middle
ages
in
knowledge
and
thought
and
now
subject
to
a
few
petty
tradesmen
and
freemasons
in
frank
opposition
to
this
bergeret
said
in
days
gone
by
men
were
just
what
they
are
now
that
is
to
say
moderately
good
and
moderately
not
so
answered
lantaigne
men
were
vigorous
in
character
and
strong
in
doctrine
when
raymond
the
great
surnamed
the
balsamic
doctor
taught
in
this
town
the
epitome
of
human
the
professor
and
the
priest
sat
down
on
a
stone
bench
where
two
old
men
and
decrepit
were
already
sitting
without
saying
a
word
in
front
of
this
bench
green
meadows
wreathed
in
light
mist
stretched
gently
downwards
to
the
poplars
that
fringed
the
river
monsieur
l
abbé
said
the
professor
i
have
like
everybody
else
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
and
the
of
raymond
the
great
in
the
municipal
library
moreover
i
have
read
the
new
book
that
abbé
cazeaux
has
devoted
to
the
balsamic
doctor
now
what
struck
me
in
that
book
abbé
cazeaux
is
one
of
my
pupils
interrupted
lantaigne
his
book
on
raymond
the
great
is
based
on
facts
which
is
praiseworthy
it
is
founded
on
theology
which
is
still
more
praiseworthy
and
rare
for
theology
is
lost
in
this
decadent
france
which
was
the
greatest
of
the
nations
as
long
as
she
was
the
most
this
book
of
cazeaux
s
answered
bergeret
appeared
to
me
to
be
interesting
from
several
points
of
view
for
want
of
a
knowledge
of
theology
i
lost
myself
in
it
more
than
once
yet
i
fancied
i
could
see
in
it
that
the
blessed
raymond
rigidly
orthodox
monk
as
he
was
claimed
for
the
teacher
the
right
of
professing
two
contradictory
opinions
on
the
same
subject
the
one
theological
and
in
accordance
with
revelation
the
other
purely
human
and
based
on
experience
or
reason
the
balsamic
doctor
whose
statue
adorns
so
sternly
the
courtyard
of
the
archbishop
s
palace
maintained
according
to
what
i
have
been
able
to
understand
that
one
and
the
same
man
may
deny
as
an
observer
or
as
a
disputant
the
truths
which
as
a
christian
he
believes
and
confesses
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
your
pupil
cazeaux
approved
of
a
system
so
abbé
lantaigne
quite
animated
by
what
he
had
just
heard
drew
his
red
silk
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
unfurled
it
like
a
flag
and
with
flushed
face
and
mouth
wide
open
flung
himself
fearlessly
on
the
challenge
thrown
down
monsieur
bergeret
as
to
whether
one
can
have
on
the
same
subject
two
distinct
opinions
the
one
theological
and
of
divine
origin
the
other
purely
rational
or
experimental
and
of
human
origin
that
is
a
question
which
i
answer
in
the
affirmative
and
i
am
going
to
prove
to
you
the
truth
of
this
apparent
contradiction
by
a
most
common
instance
when
seated
in
your
study
before
your
table
loaded
with
books
and
papers
you
exclaim
it
is
incredible
i
have
just
this
moment
put
my
on
this
table
and
now
i
do
not
see
it
there
i
see
it
i
m
sure
i
see
it
and
yet
i
no
longer
see
it
when
you
think
in
this
way
monsieur
bergeret
you
have
two
contradictory
opinions
with
respect
to
the
same
object
one
that
your
is
on
the
table
because
it
ought
to
be
there
that
opinion
is
based
on
reason
the
other
that
your
is
not
on
the
table
because
you
do
not
see
it
there
that
opinion
is
based
on
experience
there
you
have
two
irreconcilable
opinions
on
the
same
subject
and
they
are
simultaneous
you
affirm
at
the
same
time
both
the
presence
and
the
absence
of
the
you
exclaim
it
is
there
i
am
sure
of
it
at
the
very
moment
you
are
proving
it
is
not
and
having
finished
his
demonstration
abbé
lantaigne
waved
his
chequered
silk
handkerchief
like
the
flaming
banner
of
scholasticism
but
the
professor
of
literature
was
not
convinced
he
had
no
difficulty
in
showing
the
emptiness
of
this
sophism
he
replied
quite
gently
in
the
rather
weak
voice
that
he
habitually
husbanded
that
in
looking
for
his
he
experienced
fear
and
hope
by
turns
and
not
simultaneously
the
result
of
an
uncertainty
which
could
not
last
for
it
ended
by
his
making
sure
whether
the
knife
was
on
the
table
or
not
there
is
nothing
monsieur
l
abbé
added
he
nothing
in
this
instance
of
the
boxwood
knife
that
is
applicable
to
the
contradictory
judgment
which
the
blessed
raymond
or
cazeaux
or
you
yourself
might
form
on
such
or
such
a
fact
recorded
in
the
bible
when
you
state
that
it
is
at
the
same
time
both
true
and
false
allow
me
in
my
turn
to
give
you
an
instance
i
choose
of
course
in
order
to
ensnare
you
but
because
this
incident
comes
of
its
own
accord
into
my
mind
choose
the
story
of
joshua
causing
the
sun
to
stand
still
bergeret
passed
his
tongue
over
his
lips
and
smiled
for
in
truth
he
was
in
the
secret
places
of
his
soul
a
voltairean
joshua
causing
the
sun
to
stand
still
will
you
tell
me
straight
out
monsieur
l
abbé
that
joshua
made
the
sun
stand
still
and
did
not
make
it
stand
still
the
head
of
the
high
seminary
had
by
no
means
an
air
of
embarrassment
splendid
controversialist
as
he
was
he
turned
to
his
opponent
with
flashing
eyes
and
heaving
breast
after
every
reservation
has
been
expressly
made
with
respect
to
the
true
interpretation
both
literal
and
spiritual
of
the
passage
in
judges
which
you
attack
and
against
which
so
many
unbelievers
have
blindly
dashed
themselves
before
you
i
will
reply
to
you
fearlessly
yes
i
have
two
distinct
opinions
as
to
the
interpretation
of
this
miracle
i
believe
as
a
natural
philosopher
for
reasons
drawn
from
physics
that
is
to
say
from
observation
that
the
earth
turns
round
a
motionless
sun
and
as
a
theologian
i
believe
that
joshua
caused
the
sun
to
stand
still
there
is
here
a
contradiction
but
this
contradiction
is
not
irreconcilable
i
will
prove
it
to
you
at
once
for
the
idea
which
we
form
of
the
sun
is
purely
human
it
only
concerns
man
and
could
not
be
applicable
to
god
for
man
the
sun
does
not
turn
round
the
earth
i
grant
it
and
i
am
willing
to
decide
in
favour
of
copernicus
but
i
will
not
go
so
far
as
to
force
god
to
become
a
copernican
like
myself
and
i
shall
not
inquire
whether
for
god
the
sun
turns
or
does
not
turn
round
the
earth
to
speak
truly
i
had
no
need
of
the
text
of
judges
in
order
to
know
that
our
human
astronomy
is
not
the
astronomy
of
god
speculations
as
to
time
number
and
space
do
not
embrace
infinity
and
it
is
a
mad
idea
to
wish
to
entangle
the
holy
spirit
in
a
physical
or
mathematical
then
asked
the
professor
you
admit
that
even
in
mathematics
it
is
permissible
to
have
two
contradictory
opinions
the
one
human
the
other
divine
i
will
not
risk
being
reduced
to
that
extremity
answered
abbé
lantaigne
there
is
in
mathematics
an
exactitude
which
practically
reconciles
it
with
absolute
truth
numbers
on
the
contrary
are
only
dangerous
because
the
reason
being
tempted
to
seek
in
them
for
its
own
principle
runs
the
risk
of
going
so
far
astray
as
to
see
nothing
in
the
universe
save
a
system
of
numbers
this
error
has
been
condemned
by
the
church
yet
i
will
answer
you
boldly
that
human
mathematics
are
not
divine
mathematics
doubtless
however
it
would
not
be
possible
for
one
to
contradict
the
other
and
i
prefer
to
believe
that
you
do
not
wish
to
make
me
say
that
for
god
three
and
three
can
make
nine
but
we
do
not
know
all
the
properties
of
numbers
and
god
does
i
hear
that
there
are
priests
regarded
as
eminent
who
maintain
that
science
ought
to
agree
with
theology
i
detest
this
impertinence
i
will
say
this
impiety
for
there
is
a
certain
impiety
in
making
the
immutable
and
absolute
truth
walk
in
harmony
with
that
imperfect
and
provisional
truth
which
is
called
science
this
madness
of
assimilating
reality
to
appearance
the
body
to
the
soul
has
produced
a
multitude
of
miserable
baneful
opinions
through
which
the
apologists
of
this
period
have
allowed
their
foolhardy
feebleness
to
be
seen
one
a
distinguished
member
of
the
society
of
jesus
admits
the
plurality
of
inhabited
worlds
he
allows
that
intelligent
beings
may
inhabit
mars
and
venus
provided
that
to
the
earth
there
be
reserved
the
privilege
of
the
cross
by
which
it
again
becomes
unique
and
peculiar
in
the
creation
the
other
a
man
who
not
without
some
merit
occupied
in
the
sorbonne
the
chair
of
theology
which
has
since
been
abolished
grants
that
the
geologist
can
trace
the
vestiges
of
preadamites
and
reduces
the
genesis
of
the
bible
to
the
organisation
of
one
province
of
the
universe
for
the
sojourn
of
adam
and
his
seed
o
dull
folly
o
pitiable
boldness
o
ancient
novelties
already
condemned
a
hundred
times
o
violation
of
sacred
unity
how
much
better
like
raymond
the
great
and
his
historian
to
proclaim
that
science
and
religion
ought
no
more
to
be
confused
with
each
other
than
the
relative
and
the
absolute
the
finite
and
the
infinite
the
darkness
and
the
light
monsieur
l
abbé
said
the
professor
you
despise
the
priest
shook
his
head
not
so
monsieur
bergeret
not
so
i
hold
on
the
contrary
according
to
the
example
of
saint
thomas
aquinas
and
all
the
great
doctors
that
science
and
philosophy
ought
to
be
held
in
high
esteem
in
the
schools
one
does
not
despise
science
without
despising
reason
one
does
not
despise
reason
without
despising
man
one
does
not
despise
man
without
insulting
god
the
rash
scepticism
which
lays
the
blame
on
human
reason
is
the
first
step
towards
that
criminal
scepticism
that
defies
the
divine
mysteries
i
value
science
as
a
gift
which
comes
to
us
from
god
but
if
god
has
given
us
science
he
has
not
given
us
science
his
geometry
is
not
ours
ours
speculates
on
one
plane
or
in
space
his
works
in
infinitude
he
has
not
deceived
us
that
is
why
i
consider
that
there
is
a
true
human
science
he
has
not
taught
us
all
that
is
why
i
declare
the
powerlessness
of
this
science
even
though
true
to
agree
with
the
truth
of
truths
and
this
discrepancy
every
time
that
it
occurs
between
the
two
i
see
without
fear
it
proves
nothing
neither
against
heaven
nor
bergeret
confessed
that
this
system
seemed
to
him
as
clever
as
it
was
bold
and
ultimately
consonant
with
the
interests
of
the
faith
but
added
he
it
is
not
our
archbishop
s
doctrine
in
his
pastoral
letters
monseigneur
charlot
speaks
voluntarily
of
the
truths
of
religion
being
confirmed
by
the
discoveries
of
science
and
especially
by
the
experiments
of
oh
answered
abbé
lantaigne
in
a
nasal
voice
that
hissed
with
scorn
his
eminence
observes
in
philosophy
at
least
the
vow
of
evangelical
at
the
moment
when
this
phrase
was
lashing
the
air
beneath
the
quincunxes
a
corpulent
capped
by
a
wide
clerical
hat
passed
in
front
of
the
bench
speak
lower
monsieur
l
abbé
said
the
professor
abbé
guitrel
hears
viii
was
chatting
with
abbé
guitrel
in
the
shop
of
rondonneau
junior
goldsmith
and
jeweller
he
leant
back
in
an
and
crossed
his
legs
so
that
the
sole
of
one
of
his
boots
stuck
up
towards
the
placid
old
man
s
chin
monsieur
l
abbé
it
is
useless
for
you
to
speak
you
are
an
enlightened
priest
you
see
in
religion
a
collection
of
moral
precepts
a
necessary
discipline
and
not
a
set
of
antiquated
dogmas
of
mysteries
whose
absurdity
is
only
too
little
as
a
priest
guitrel
had
excellent
rules
of
conduct
one
of
these
rules
was
to
avoid
scandal
and
to
hold
his
tongue
rather
than
expose
the
truth
to
the
mockery
of
unbelievers
and
as
this
precaution
agreed
with
the
bent
of
his
character
he
observed
it
scrupulously
but
was
lacking
in
discretion
his
vast
fleshy
nose
his
thick
lips
seemed
like
a
powerful
apparatus
of
suction
and
absorption
whilst
his
receding
forehead
above
his
great
pale
eyes
betrayed
his
opposition
to
all
moral
delicacy
he
persisted
marshalled
against
christian
dogmas
the
arguments
of
the
masonic
lodges
and
the
literary
cafés
and
concluded
by
saying
that
it
was
impossible
for
an
intelligent
man
to
believe
a
word
of
the
catechism
then
bringing
down
his
fat
beringed
hand
on
the
priest
s
shoulder
he
said
you
don
t
answer
my
dear
abbé
you
are
of
my
guitrel
in
some
sort
a
martyr
was
forced
to
confess
his
faith
pardon
me
monsieur
that
little
book
the
catechism
which
it
is
the
fashion
to
despise
in
certain
quarters
contains
more
truths
than
the
great
treatises
on
philosophy
which
make
such
a
vast
noise
in
the
world
the
catechism
unites
the
most
learned
metaphysics
with
the
most
effective
simplicity
this
appreciation
is
not
mine
it
is
that
of
an
eminent
philosopher
jules
simon
who
ranks
the
catechism
above
plato
s
the
dared
not
contradict
the
opinion
of
an
he
remembered
at
the
same
time
that
his
official
superior
the
present
secretary
of
state
for
the
home
department
was
a
protestant
he
said
as
an
official
i
respect
all
religions
equally
protestantism
as
well
as
catholicism
as
a
man
i
am
a
freethinker
and
if
i
had
any
preference
as
to
dogma
let
me
tell
you
monsieur
l
abbé
that
it
would
be
in
favour
of
the
reformed
guitrel
replied
in
an
unctuous
voice
there
are
doubtless
among
protestants
many
persons
eminently
estimable
from
the
point
of
view
of
morals
and
i
dare
say
many
exemplary
persons
if
they
are
judged
from
the
world
s
standpoint
but
the
reformed
church
is
but
a
limb
hacked
from
the
catholic
church
and
the
place
of
the
wound
still
indifferent
to
this
powerful
phrase
borrowed
from
bossuet
drew
from
his
case
a
big
cigar
lighted
it
and
holding
out
the
case
to
the
priest
will
you
accept
a
cigar
monsieur
l
abbé
being
densely
ignorant
of
ecclesiastical
discipline
and
believing
that
was
forbidden
to
the
clergy
he
offered
a
cigar
to
guitrel
in
order
to
make
him
look
awkward
or
to
lead
him
astray
in
his
ignorance
he
believed
that
by
this
offer
he
was
leading
a
wearer
of
the
cassock
into
sin
making
him
fall
into
disobedience
perhaps
into
sacrilege
and
almost
into
apostasy
but
guitrel
placidly
took
the
cigar
slipped
it
carefully
into
the
pocket
of
his
and
said
urbanely
that
he
would
smoke
it
after
supper
in
his
room
thus
and
abbé
guitrel
professor
of
sacred
rhetoric
at
the
high
seminary
conversed
in
the
goldsmith
s
office
near
them
rondonneau
junior
contractor
to
the
archbishop
who
also
worked
for
the
prefecture
listened
to
the
conversation
discreetly
without
taking
part
in
it
he
was
preparing
his
mail
and
his
bald
pate
came
and
went
among
his
and
the
samples
of
commercial
jewellery
heaped
up
on
the
table
with
a
brusque
movement
stood
upright
pushed
abbé
guitrel
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
into
the
recess
of
the
window
and
whispered
in
his
ear
my
dear
guitrel
you
know
that
the
bishopric
of
tourcoing
is
i
have
in
fact
answered
the
priest
learnt
of
the
death
of
monseigneur
duclou
it
is
a
great
loss
for
the
church
of
france
monseigneur
duclou
s
merits
were
only
equalled
by
his
modesty
he
excelled
in
preaching
his
pastoral
addresses
are
models
of
hortatory
eloquence
shall
i
dare
to
recall
to
mind
that
i
knew
him
in
orleans
at
the
time
when
he
was
still
abbé
duclou
the
revered
curé
of
and
that
at
that
time
he
deigned
to
honour
me
with
his
gracious
friendship
the
news
of
his
premature
death
was
particularly
distressing
to
he
was
silent
letting
his
lips
droop
in
sign
of
grief
it
s
not
a
question
of
that
said
the
he
is
dead
it
is
a
question
of
filling
his
guitrel
s
face
changed
now
screwing
up
his
little
eyes
till
they
were
quite
round
he
looked
like
a
rat
who
sees
bacon
in
the
larder
you
must
know
my
dear
guitrel
continued
the
that
this
business
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
me
it
is
not
i
who
appoint
the
bishops
i
am
not
the
keeper
of
the
seals
nor
the
nuncio
nor
the
pope
god
be
thanked
and
he
began
to
laugh
by
the
bye
on
what
terms
do
you
stand
with
the
nuncio
the
nuncio
monsieur
looks
upon
me
with
friendliness
as
a
humble
and
dutiful
servant
of
the
holy
father
but
i
do
not
flatter
myself
that
he
especially
heeds
me
in
the
humble
station
in
which
i
have
been
placed
and
where
i
am
content
to
my
dear
abbé
if
i
speak
to
you
about
this
between
ourselves
isn
t
it
is
because
there
is
a
question
of
sending
a
priest
from
my
county
town
to
tourcoing
i
hear
on
good
authority
that
the
name
of
abbé
lantaigne
head
of
the
high
seminary
is
being
brought
forward
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
i
may
be
asked
to
supply
confidential
information
about
the
candidate
he
is
your
ecclesiastical
superior
what
do
you
think
of
him
guitrel
answered
with
downcast
eyes
it
is
certain
that
abbé
lantaigne
would
bring
to
the
episcopal
see
once
sanctified
by
the
apostle
loup
both
eminent
piety
and
the
precious
gifts
of
eloquence
his
lenten
sermons
preached
at
have
been
justly
admired
for
their
logical
arrangement
of
ideas
and
power
of
expression
and
it
is
commonly
recognised
that
some
of
the
sermons
would
fall
in
no
respect
short
of
perfection
if
there
were
present
in
them
that
unction
that
perfumed
and
consecrated
oil
if
i
may
dare
so
to
call
it
which
alone
penetrates
the
heart
the
curé
of
took
pleasure
in
being
the
first
to
declare
that
lantaigne
in
speaking
the
word
from
the
pulpit
of
the
most
venerable
church
in
the
diocese
had
deserved
well
of
the
great
apostle
of
the
gauls
who
laid
the
first
stone
of
it
by
reason
of
an
ardour
and
a
zeal
whose
very
excesses
were
excused
by
their
benevolent
origin
he
only
deplored
the
orator
s
excursions
into
the
domain
of
contemporary
history
for
it
must
needs
be
confessed
that
lantaigne
has
no
fear
of
walking
on
embers
that
are
still
burning
lantaigne
is
distinguished
by
piety
learning
and
talent
what
a
pity
that
a
priest
worthy
of
being
raised
to
the
highest
positions
in
the
church
should
believe
it
to
be
his
duty
to
proclaim
a
devotion
doubtless
praiseworthy
in
principle
but
reckless
in
its
results
to
an
exiled
family
from
whom
he
has
received
favours
he
takes
pleasure
in
showing
a
copy
of
the
de
bound
in
purple
and
gold
which
was
given
to
him
by
the
comtesse
de
paris
and
he
displays
far
too
freely
the
extent
of
his
gratitude
and
fidelity
and
what
a
misfortune
that
an
arrogance
excusable
perhaps
in
such
lofty
talent
should
lead
him
even
to
the
lengths
of
speaking
publicly
under
the
quincunxes
about
the
in
terms
which
i
dare
not
repeat
alas
failing
my
voice
all
the
trees
on
the
mall
would
these
words
that
fell
from
the
mouth
of
lantaigne
in
the
presence
of
bergeret
professor
of
literature
in
brain
alone
his
eminence
observes
the
evangelical
vow
of
poverty
such
sayings
are
habitual
with
him
and
was
he
not
heard
to
say
at
the
last
ordination
when
his
eminence
advanced
clothed
in
those
pontifical
ornaments
which
he
bears
with
so
much
dignity
notwithstanding
his
short
stature
golden
cross
wooden
bishop
most
unseasonably
he
thus
censured
the
magnificence
with
which
monseigneur
charlot
delights
to
celebrate
the
offices
as
well
as
to
regulate
the
ordering
of
his
official
banquets
and
especially
the
dinner
which
he
gave
to
the
general
in
command
of
the
new
and
to
which
you
were
invited
monsieur
and
in
particular
any
better
agreement
between
the
prefecture
and
the
archbishopric
offends
abbé
lantaigne
who
is
far
too
inclined
unfortunately
to
prolong
the
painful
misunderstandings
from
which
church
and
state
suffer
equally
in
scorn
of
the
precepts
of
paul
and
the
teaching
of
his
holiness
leo
the

his
mouth
quite
wide
being
in
the
habit
of
listening
with
it
he
burst
out
this
lantaigne
is
steeped
in
the
most
detestable
spirit
of
clericalism
he
owes
me
a
grudge
what
has
he
got
against
me
am
i
not
tolerant
and
liberal
enough
did
i
not
shut
my
eyes
when
on
all
sides
the
monks
and
nuns
the
convents
the
schools
for
if
we
vigorously
uphold
the
essential
laws
of
the
republic
we
hardly
enforce
them
but
priests
are
incorrigible
you
are
all
the
same
you
cry
out
that
you
are
being
oppressed
as
soon
as
you
yourself
are
not
oppressing
and
what
does
he
say
about
me
this
lantaigne
of
yours
nothing
definite
can
be
set
forth
against
the
administration
of
but
an
uncompromising
soul
like
lantaigne
never
forgives
either
your
association
with
freemasonry
or
your
jewish
the
shook
the
ash
from
his
cigar
the
jews
are
no
friends
of
mine
i
have
no
ties
in
the
jewish
world
but
be
tranquil
my
dear
abbé
i
give
you
my
word
that
lantaigne
shall
not
be
bishop
of
tourcoing
i
have
enough
influence
in
the
bureaux
to
checkmate
him
just
listen
to
me
guitrel
i
had
no
money
when
i
started
out
in
life
i
made
connections
for
myself
connections
are
worth
nearly
as
much
as
wealth
i
have
many
and
good
ones
i
shall
be
on
the
watch
to
see
that
abbé
lantaigne
cuts
his
own
throat
in
the
bureaux
besides
my
wife
has
a
candidate
for
the
bishopric
of
tourcoing
and
that
candidate
is
you
at
this
word
abbé
guitrel
cast
down
his
eyes
and
flung
up
his
arms
i
sit
in
the
seat
sanctified
by
the
blessed
loup
and
by
so
many
pious
apostles
of
northern
gaul
can
such
a
thought
have
occurred
to
madame
my
dear
guitrel
she
wishes
that
you
should
wear
the
mitre
and
i
assure
you
she
is
powerful
enough
to
create
a
bishop
for
my
part
i
shall
not
be
sorry
to
give
a
republican
bishop
to
the
republic
that
s
understood
my
dear
guitrel
you
look
after
the
archbishop
and
the
nuncio
my
wife
and
i
will
set
the
bureaux
in
and
guitrel
murmured
with
clasped
hands
the
ancient
and
venerable
see
of
tourcoing
a
bishopric
a
mere
hole
my
dear
abbé
but
one
must
make
a
beginning
why
do
you
know
where
i
started
my
career
in
official
life
at
céret
i
was
of
céret
in
the
would
any
one
credit
it
but
i
am
wasting
my
time
gossiping
good
evening
the
held
out
his
hand
to
the
priest
and
guitrel
went
off
along
the
winding
street
of
the
tintelleries
humbly
and
with
shoulders
bent
yet
planning
cunning
measures
and
promising
himself
on
the
day
when
he
wore
the
mitre
and
grasped
the
crozier
to
resist
the
civil
government
like
a
prince
of
the
church
to
fight
the
freemasons
and
to
hurl
anathemas
at
the
principles
of
freethought
the
republic
and
the
revolution
ix
an
article
in
informed
the
town
of
that
it
possessed
a
prophetess
this
was
mademoiselle
claude
deniseau
daughter
of
a
man
who
kept
a
registry
for
country
servants
up
to
the
age
of
seventeen
mademoiselle
deniseau
had
not
revealed
to
the
closest
observer
any
abnormality
of
mind
or
body
she
was
a
fair
fat
short
girl
neither
pretty
nor
ugly
but
pleasant
and
of
a
lively
disposition
she
had
received
said
a
good
education
and
she
was
religious
without
at
the
beginning
of
her
eighteenth
year
on
the
of
february
at
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
being
engaged
in
laying
the
cloth
on
the
table
in
the
she
thought
she
heard
her
mother
s
voice
saying
claudine
go
to
your
she
went
there
and
between
the
bed
and
the
door
she
perceived
a
bright
light
and
heard
a
voice
which
spoke
from
the
light
saying
claudine
this
country
must
do
penance
for
that
will
ward
off
great
misfortunes
i
am
saint
radegonde
queen
of
mademoiselle
deniseau
then
descried
in
the
splendour
a
luminous
and
as
it
were
transparent
face
that
wore
a
crown
of
gold
and
gems
after
that
saint
radegonde
came
every
day
to
converse
with
mademoiselle
deniseau
to
whom
she
revealed
secrets
and
made
prophecies
she
had
foretold
the
frosts
that
blighted
the
vine
in
blossom
and
revealed
that
rieu
curé
of
would
not
see
the
easter
festival
the
venerable
rieu
actually
died
on
holy
thursday
for
the
republic
and
for
france
she
never
ceased
to
foretell
terrible
disasters
close
at
floods
massacres
but
god
wearied
of
chastising
a
faithless
people
would
at
last
under
a
king
bring
back
peace
and
prosperity
to
it
the
saint
diagnosed
and
cured
diseases
under
her
inspiration
mademoiselle
deniseau
had
told
jobelin
the
of
an
ointment
which
had
cured
him
of
an
anchylosis
of
the
knee
jobelin
had
been
able
to
resume
his
work
again
these
marvels
attracted
a
crowd
of
inquirers
to
the
flat
inhabited
by
the
deniseau
family
in
the
place
above
the
tramway
office
the
young
girl
was
studied
by
ecclesiastics
retired
officers
and
doctors
of
medicine
they
believed
that
they
noticed
when
she
was
repeating
the
words
of
saint
radegonde
that
her
voice
became
deeper
her
expression
sterner
and
that
her
limbs
became
rigid
they
also
noticed
that
she
used
expressions
which
are
not
customary
with
young
girls
and
that
her
words
could
be
explained
by
no
natural
means
at
first
indifferent
and
scoffing
soon
followed
the
extraordinary
success
of
the
prophetess
with
anxiety
for
she
announced
the
end
of
the
republic
and
the
return
of
france
to
a
christian
monarchy
had
entered
office
at
the
time
of
the
scandals
at
the
élysée
under
president
grévy
since
then
he
had
participated
in
those
cases
of
corruption
that
are
endlessly
being
hushed
up
and
as
constantly
revived
to
the
great
detriment
of
parliament
and
the
public
authority
and
this
spectacle
which
seemed
natural
to
him
had
ingrafted
in
his
mind
a
profound
feeling
of
laxity
which
spread
from
him
to
all
his
subordinates
a
senator
and
two
deputies
from
his
department
were
being
threatened
with
legal
proceedings
the
most
influential
members
of
the
party
engineers
and
financiers
were
either
in
prison
or
in
hiding
under
these
circumstances
satisfied
that
the
people
were
attached
to
the
republican
rule
he
expected
from
them
neither
enthusiasm
nor
deference
which
seemed
to
him
but
qualities
and
the
empty
symbols
of
a
vanished
age
events
had
enlarged
his
naturally
limited
intelligence
the
vast
irony
of
things
had
passed
into
his
soul
making
it
mocking
indifferent
having
recognised
moreover
that
the
electoral
committees
constituted
the
only
real
authority
that
still
subsisted
in
the
department
he
obeyed
them
with
a
semblance
of
zeal
and
with
secret
opposition
if
he
executed
their
orders
it
was
not
without
a
considerable
modification
of
their
rigour
in
a
word
from
opportunist
he
had
become
liberal
and
progressive
he
willingly
allowed
liberty
of
speech
and
action
but
he
was
too
wise
to
allow
any
unbearable
excesses
and
like
a
conscientious
official
he
took
good
care
that
the
government
should
not
receive
any
glaring
insult
and
that
the
ministers
should
peaceably
enjoy
that
common
attitude
of
indifference
which
by
gaining
over
their
friends
as
well
as
their
enemies
ensured
at
the
same
time
both
their
power
and
their
repose
it
pleased
him
that
the
governmental
papers
and
the
opposition
ones
both
being
compromised
by
financial
transactions
should
be
utterly
discredited
alike
as
to
their
praise
and
their
blame
the
socialist
sheet
being
the
only
independent
one
was
also
the
only
violent
one
but
it
was
very
poor
and
the
fear
which
it
inspired
drove
people
back
towards
the
government
thus
was
entirely
sincere
when
he
informed
the
home
secretary
that
the
political
situation
was
excellent
in
his
department
and
here
was
the
prophetess
of
the
place
destroying
the
harmony
of
this
happy
state
under
the
direction
of
saint
radegonde
she
announced
the
fall
of
the
ministry
the
dissolution
of
parliament
the
resignation
of
the
president
of
the
republic
and
the
collapse
of
a
discredited
government
she
was
much
more
violent
than
and
far
more
influential
for
drew
but
few
while
the
whole
town
thronged
around
mademoiselle
deniseau
the
clergy
the
large
landowners
the

the

hung
upon
her
and
drank
in
her
words
saint
radegonde
rallied
the
defeated
enemies
of
the
republic
and
brought
together
the
a
harmless
rally
but
inconvenient
was
especially
afraid
lest
a
paris
paper
should
noise
the
affair
about
it
would
then
assume
said
he
to
himself
the
proportions
of
a
scandal
and
would
expose
me
to
a
reprimand
from
the
he
resolved
to
look
for
the
quietest
way
of
silencing
mademoiselle
deniseau
and
first
began
to
make
inquiries
as
to
the
character
of
her
relations
her
father
s
family
was
not
much
respected
in
the
town
the
deniseaux
were
people
of
no
position
mademoiselle
claude
s
father
kept
a
registry
office
the
reputation
of
which
was
neither
better
nor
worse
than
that
of
other
registries
masters
and
servants
complained
of
it
but
still
made
use
of
it
in
deniseau
had
had
the
commune
proclaimed
in
the
place
somewhat
later
upon
the
expulsion
of
three
dominicans
at
the
point
of
the
sword
he
had
offered
resistance
to
the
gendarmes
and
had
got
himself
arrested
next
he
had
stood
at
municipal
elections
as
a
socialist
and
had
only
obtained
a
very
small
number
of
votes
he
was
and
but
believed
to
be
honest
the
mother
was
a
nadal
the
nadals
in
a
better
position
than
the
deniseaux
were
small
agricultural
proprietors
all
much
respected
one
of
the
nadals
an
aunt
to
mademoiselle
claude
being
subject
to
hallucinations
had
been
shut
up
in
an
asylum
for
some
years
the
nadals
were
religious
and
had
clerical
connections
could
learn
nothing
more
about
them
one
morning
he
had
a
conversation
on
this
subject
with
his
private
secretary
lacarelle
who
belonged
to
an
old
family
in
the
neighbourhood
and
knew
the
department
well
my
dear
lacarelle
we
must
put
an
end
to
this
madness
for
it
is
plain
that
mademoiselle
deniseau
is
lacarelle
replied
gravely
not
without
the
kind
of
arrogance
inseparable
from
his
long
fair
moustaches
monsieur
opinions
are
divided
with
respect
to
this
and
many
people
believe
that
mademoiselle
deniseau
is
perfectly
after
all
lacarelle
you
do
not
believe
that
saint
radegonde
comes
every
morning
to
chat
with
her
and
to
drag
the
head
of
the
state
along
with
the
government
down
into
the
but
lacarelle
was
of
opinion
that
there
had
been
exaggeration
that
persons
were
making
the
most
of
an
extraordinary
manifestation
it
really
was
extraordinary
that
mademoiselle
deniseau
should
prescribe
sovereign
remedies
for
incurable
diseases
she
had
cured
jobelin
the
and
an
old
bailiff
called
favru
that
was
not
all
she
foretold
events
that
fell
out
as
she
had
said
i
can
vouch
for
one
fact
monsieur
last
week
mademoiselle
deniseau
said
there
is
a
treasure
hidden
in
a
field
called
faifeu
at
they
dug
at
the
place
described
and
discovered
a
great
slab
of
stone
which
blocked
the
entrance
of
an
underground
but
still
cried
the
you
can
not
maintain
that
saint
radegonde
he
stopped
thoughtful
and
questioning
he
was
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
saintly
legends
of
christian
gaul
and
of
the
national
antiquities
of
france
but
at
school
he
had
studied
of
history
he
was
struggling
to
recall
his
boyish
recollections
saint
radegonde
was
the
mother
of
saint
louis
lacarelle
who
knew
more
history
only
hesitated
a
moment
no
said
he
the
mother
of
saint
louis
was
blanche
of
castille
saint
radegonde
was
an
earlier
well
she
can
not
be
allowed
to
perform
her
conjuring
tricks
in
the
county
town
and
you
my
dear
lacarelle
you
ought
to
make
her
father
deniseau
i
mean
to
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
give
a
good
flogging
to
his
daughter
and
put
her
under
lock
and
lacarelle
smoothed
his
gallic
moustaches
monsieur
i
advise
you
to
go
and
see
this
deniseau
girl
she
is
interesting
she
will
give
you
a
private
sitting
quite
to
you
can
t
mean
it
lacarelle
fancy
my
going
to
be
instructed
by
a
little
hussy
that
my
government
is
on
the
point
of
collapse
was
not
credulous
he
only
thought
of
religion
from
a
political
point
of
view
he
had
inherited
no
creed
from
his
parents
who
were
aliens
to
every
superstition
as
they
were
to
every
land
his
soul
had
sucked
none
of
the
nourishment
of
the
past
from
any
soil
he
remained
empty
colourless
unfettered
through
metaphysical
incompetency
and
the
instinctive
feeling
for
action
and
acquisition
he
clung
to
tangible
truth
and
in
all
good
faith
believed
himself
to
be
a
positivist
having
but
lately
drunk
his
bocks
in
the
cafés
at
montmartre
in
the
company
of
chemists
with
political
opinions
he
still
preserved
a
blind
trustfulness
in
scientific
methods
which
he
in
his
turn
extolled
in
the
lodges
to
the
leading
spirits
among
the
freemasons
he
enjoyed
embellishing
his
political
intrigues
and
administrative
expedients
with
the
fair
appearance
of
sociological
experiment
and
the
more
useful
science
was
to
him
the
better
he
appreciated
it
i
profess
said
he
in
all
sincerity
that
unquestioning
faith
in
facts
which
constitutes
the
scientist
the
and
it
was
just
because
he
only
believed
in
facts
and
because
he
professed
the
creed
of
positivism
that
the
affair
of
the
sibyl
began
to
worry
him
his
private
secretary
lacarelle
had
said
to
him
this
young
woman
has
cured
a
and
a
bailiff
these
are
facts
she
has
pointed
out
the
place
where
they
would
discover
a
treasure
and
they
really
found
in
that
place
a
to
the
opening
of
a
subterranean
passage
that
is
a
fact
she
foretold
the
failure
of
the
vines
that
is
a
had
the
instinct
of
mockery
and
a
sense
of
humour
but
this
word
exercised
a
spell
over
his
mind
and
it
occurred
vaguely
to
his
memory
that
doctors
like
charcot
had
made
observations
in
the
hospitals
on
sick
people
gifted
with
extraordinary
powers
he
remembered
certain
curious
phenomena
of
hysteria
and
cases
of
second
sight
he
wondered
whether
mademoiselle
deniseau
were
not
a
sufficiently
interesting
hysteric
patient
for
her
to
be
handed
over
to
the
experts
in
mental
cases
which
would
rid
the
town
of
her
he
thought
i
might
give
an
official
order
for
the
consignment
of
this
girl
to
an
asylum
as
in
the
case
of
any
person
whose
mental
derangement
forms
a
danger
to
public
order
and
personal
safety
but
the
enemies
of
the
government
would
squeal
like
polecats
and
i
can
already
hear
lawyer
lerond
charging
me
with
unlawful
committal
the
plot
must
be
unravelled
if
the
clericals
of
the
county
town
have
concocted
one
for
it
is
not
to
be
endured
that
mademoiselle
deniseau
should
declare
every
day
as
the
mouthpiece
of
saint
radegonde
that
the
republic
is
sinking
into
the
mire
i
grant
that
some
regrettable
deeds
have
been
done
certain
partial
changes
will
force
themselves
on
us
especially
in
national
representation
but
thank
god
the
government
is
still
strong
enough
for
me
to
support
x
abbé
lantaigne
principal
of
the
high
seminary
and
bergeret
professor
of
literature
were
seated
in
conversation
on
a
bench
on
the
mall
according
to
their
custom
in
summer
on
every
subject
they
were
opposed
in
opinion
never
were
two
men
more
different
in
mind
and
character
but
they
were
the
only
people
in
the
town
who
took
an
interest
in
general
ideas
this
united
them
while
philosophising
beneath
the
quincunxes
when
the
weather
was
fine
they
consoled
each
other
one
for
the
loneliness
of
celibacy
the
other
for
the
vexations
of
domestic
life
both
for
their
professional
cares
and
for
the
unpopularity
each
alike
shared
on
this
particular
day
they
could
see
from
the
bench
where
they
sat
the
monument
of
jeanne
d
arc
still
shrouded
in
wrappings
the
maid
having
once
slept
a
night
in
the
town
at
the
house
of
an
honest
dame
called
la
gausse
in
the
municipality
with
the
concurrence
of
the
state
had
caused
a
monument
to
be
raised
to
commemorate
this
stay
this
monument
the
work
of
two
artists
the
one
a
sculptor
and
the
other
an
architect
both
natives
of
the
district
displayed
the
maid
fully
armed
standing
meditative
on
a
high
pedestal
the
date
of
the
unveiling
was
fixed
for
the
following
sunday
the
minister
of
education
was
expected
and
it
was
reckoned
that
there
would
be
a
lavish
distribution
of
crosses
of
honour
and
academic
decorations
the
townsfolk
thronged
the
mall
to
gaze
at
the
linen
which
covered
the
bronze
figure
and
the
stone
pedestal
outsiders
installed
themselves
on

up
under

up

bearing

at
sight
of
this
bergeret
remarked
that
one
ought
to
rejoice
in
this
concourse
of
citizens
assembled
to
pay
honour
to
the
liberator
of
orleans
the
archivist
of
the
department
mazure
added
he
stands
out
from
the
crowd
he
has
written
a
memoir
to
prove
that
the
famous
historical
tapestry
representing
the
meeting
at
chinon
was
not
made
about
in
germany
as
was
believed
but
that
it
came
at
that
period
from
some
studio
of
flemish
france
he
submitted
the
conclusions
of
his
memoir
to
who
called
them
eminently
patriotic
and
approved
of
them
he
expressed
a
hope
that
he
would
see
the
author
of
this
discovery
receiving
the
insignia
of
an
officer
of
the
academy
beneath
jeanne
s
statue
it
is
also
rumoured
that
in
his
speech
at
the
unveiling
will
say
with
his
eyes
turned
towards
the
vosges
that
jeanne
was
a
daughter
of
abbé
lantaigne
caring
but
little
for
a
joke
made
no
reply
and
kept
a
grave
face
in
principle
he
regarded
these
celebrations
in
honour
of
jeanne
d
arc
as
praiseworthy
two
years
before
he
had
himself
pronounced
at
a
panegyric
on
the
maid
and
had
declared
her
the
type
of
the
good
frenchwoman
and
the
good
christian
he
found
no
subject
for
jest
in
a
solemnity
which
was
a
glorification
of
faith
and
country
as
a
patriot
and
a
christian
he
only
regretted
that
the
bishop
and
his
clergy
would
not
take
the
first
place
in
it
the
thing
said
he
that
ensures
the
continuity
of
the
french
nation
is
neither
kings
nor
presidents
of
the
republic
neither
provincial
governors
nor
neither
officers
of
the
crown
nor
officials
of
the
present
government
it
is
the
episcopacy
which
from
the
first
apostles
to
the
gauls
down
to
the
present
day
has
continued
without
break
change
or
diminution
and
forms
so
to
say
the
solid
web
of
the
history
of
france
the
power
of
the
bishops
is
spiritual
and
stable
the
power
of
the
kings
legitimate
but
transitory
is
decrepit
from
its
birth
on
its
continuance
that
of
the
nation
does
not
depend
the
nation
is
a
spiritual
conception
inseparable
from
the
moral
and
religious
idea
but
although
absent
in
the
body
from
the
celebrations
that
are
being
arranged
for
here
the
clergy
will
be
present
at
them
in
spirit
and
in
truth
jeanne
d
arc
is
ours
and
it
is
vain
for
unbelievers
to
try
and
steal
her
from
bergeret
it
is
however
very
natural
that
this
simple
girl
having
become
a
symbol
of
patriotism
should
be
claimed
by
all
lantaigne
i
can
not
have
told
you
so
without
religion
every
duty
comes
from
god
the
duty
of
the
citizen
no
less
than
that
of
others
if
god
be
ignored
the
call
of
duty
is
stilled
if
it
is
a
right
and
a
duty
to
defend
one
s
native
land
against
the
foreigner
it
is
not
in
virtue
of
any
pretended
rights
of
man
which
never
existed
but
in
conformity
with
the
will
of
god
this
conformity
appears
in
the
stories
of
jael
and
judith
it
shines
clearly
in
the
book
of
the
maccabees
it
can
be
read
in
the
deeds
of
the
bergeret
then
you
believe
monsieur
l
abbé
that
jeanne
d
arc
received
her
mission
from
god
himself
that
will
land
you
in
numberless
difficulties
i
will
only
submit
to
you
one
of
these
because
it
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
your
beliefs
it
relates
to
the
voices
and
apparitions
which
manifested
themselves
to
the
peasant
of
domremy
those
who
grant
that
saint
catherine
really
appeared
to
jacquot
d
arc
s
daughter
in
company
with
saint
michael
and
saint
marguerite
will
find
themselves
i
fancy
much
embarrassed
when
it
has
been
proved
to
them
that
this
saint
catherine
of
alexandria
never
existed
and
that
her
history
is
in
reality
only
a
rather
poor
greek
romance
now
this
fact
was
proved
as
early
as
the
seventeenth
century
not
by
the
freethinkers
of
the
period
but
by
a
learned
doctor
of
the
sorbonne
jean
de
launoy
a
man
of
piety
and
good
life
the
judicious
tillemont
although
so
submissive
to
the
church
rejected
the
biography
of
saint
catherine
as
an
absurd
fable
is
not
that
a
difficulty
monsieur
l
abbé
for
those
who
believe
that
the
voices
of
jeanne
d
arc
came
from
heaven
lantaigne
the
martyrology
monsieur
worthy
of
all
reverence
as
it
is
is
not
an
article
of
faith
and
it
is
permissible
in
imitation
of
doctor
de
launoy
and
tillemont
to
cast
doubts
on
the
existence
of
saint
catherine
of
alexandria
for
my
part
i
am
not
inclined
to
go
so
far
and
i
hold
such
an
absolute
denial
as
rash
i
recognise
that
the
biography
of
this
saint
has
come
to
us
from
the
east
overlaid
everywhere
with
fabulous
details
but
i
believe
that
these
embellishments
have
been
laid
over
a
solid
foundation
neither
launoy
nor
tillemont
is
infallible
it
is
not
certain
that
saint
catherine
never
existed
and
if
by
chance
historic
proof
of
her
were
established
that
would
give
way
before
the
theological
testimony
to
the
contrary
furnished
by
the
miraculous
appearances
of
this
saint
authenticated
by
the
ordinary
and
solemnly
recognised
by
the
pope
for
after
all
good
logic
requires
that
truths
of
the
scientific
plane
should
yield
to
truths
of
a
higher
order
but
we
are
not
yet
in
a
position
to
know
the
opinion
of
the
church
as
to
the
maid
s
apparitions
jeanne
d
arc
has
not
been
canonised
and
the
miracles
wrought
for
her
or
by
her
are
open
to
discussion
i
neither
deny
nor
affirm
them
and
it
is
a
purely
human
vision
which
makes
me
perceive
in
the
history
of
this
marvellous
girl
the
hand
of
god
stretched
out
over
france
truth
to
tell
though
that
vision
is
powerful
and
bergeret
if
i
have
rightly
understood
you
monsieur
l
abbé
you
do
not
consider
the
strange
event
at
fierbois
as
an
attested
miracle
when
jeanne
as
they
say
pointed
out
a
sword
concealed
in
the
wall
and
you
are
not
certain
that
the
maid
as
she
herself
declared
brought
back
a
child
to
life
at
lagny
you
know
my
opinions
and
for
my
part
i
should
give
a
natural
interpretation
to
these
two
facts
i
suppose
that
the
sword
was
fastened
to
the
wall
of
the
church
as
a
votive
offering
and
was
consequently
visible
as
for
the
child
that
the
maid
raised
from
the
dead
for
the
time
necessary
for
the
administration
of
baptism
and
who
died
again
after
having
been
brought
to
the
font
i
confine
myself
to
reminding
you
that
there
was
near
domremy
a
whose
particular
function
it
was
to
endow
children
with
a
few
hours
of
life
i
suspect
that
the
memory
of
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
illusions
that
possessed
jeanne
d
arc
when
she
believed
at
lagny
that
she
had
raised
a
child
from
the
lantaigne
there
is
much
uncertainty
in
these
explanations
monsieur
and
rather
than
adopt
them
i
suspend
my
judgment
which
inclines
i
confess
towards
the
miraculous
side
at
least
with
respect
to
saint
catherine
s
sword
for
the
passage
is
precise
the
sword
was
the
wall
and
it
was
necessary
to
excavate
to
find
it
neither
is
it
impossible
again
that
god
upon
the
efficacious
prayers
of
a
virgin
should
have
given
life
back
to
a
child
that
had
died
without
having
received
bergeret
you
speak
monsieur
l
abbé
of
the
efficacious
prayers
of
a
do
you
then
grant
in
accordance
with
the
belief
of
the
middle
ages
that
there
was
some
virtue
some
peculiar
power
in
jeanne
d
arc
s
virginity
lantaigne
clearly
virginity
is
pleasing
to
god
and
jesus
christ
rejoices
in
the
triumph
of
his
virgins
a
young
girl
turned
attila
and
his
huns
back
from
lutetia
a
young
girl
delivered
orleans
and
caused
the
lawful
king
to
be
crowned
at
the
priest
having
thus
expressed
himself
bergeret
seized
on
his
words
in
a
way
of
his
own
exactly
said
he
jeanne
d
arc
was
a
but
abbé
lantaigne
did
not
hear
he
rose
and
said
france
s
destined
rôle
in
christendom
is
not
yet
achieved
i
foresee
that
ere
long
god
will
yet
again
work
his
will
through
the
nation
which
has
been
the
most
faithful
and
the
most
faithless
to
and
so
it
is
answered
bergeret
that
as
in
the
profligate
times
of
king
charles
we
behold
the
rise
of
prophetesses
our
town
indeed
holds
one
of
them
who
is
making
a
happier
start
than
jeanne
since
jacquot
d
arc
s
daughter
was
regarded
as
mad
by
her
parents
and
mademoiselle
deniseau
finds
a
disciple
in
her
own
father
still
i
do
not
believe
that
her
good
luck
will
be
great
and
lasting
our
is
somewhat
wanting
in
good
breeding
but
he
is
less
of
a
simpleton
than
baudricourt
and
it
is
no
longer
the
custom
for
the
heads
of
the
state
to
give
audience
to
prophetesses
félix
faure
will
not
be
advised
by
his
confessor
to
test
mademoiselle
deniseau
here
perhaps
you
may
reply
monsieur
l
abbé
that
the
influence
of
bernadette
of
lourdes
is
stronger
in
our
days
than
that
of
jeanne
d
arc
ever
was
the
latter
overthrew
some
hundreds
of
starving
and
english
bernadette
has
set
countless
pilgrims
on
the
march
and
drawn
thousands
of
millions
to
a
mountain
in
the
pyrenees
and
my
revered
friend
pierre
laffitte
assures
me
that
we
have
entered
on
an
era
of
positive
as
for
what
happens
at
lourdes
said
abbé
lantaigne
without
becoming
latitudinarian
or
falling
into
excessive
credulity
i
reserve
my
opinion
on
a
point
upon
which
the
church
has
made
no
pronouncement
but
henceforth
i
see
a
triumph
for
religion
in
this
crowd
of
pilgrims
just
as
you
yourself
see
in
it
a
defeat
for
materialistic
xi
the
ministry
had
fallen
felt
neither
surprise
nor
regret
at
this
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
he
had
always
considered
it
too
restless
and
too
disturbing
an
object
of
suspicion
and
not
without
reason
to
the
agriculturist
the
large
merchant
and
the
small
investor
without
affecting
the
fortunate
indifference
of
the
masses
this
cabinet
had
exercised
to
the
grief
a
vexatious
influence
over
freemasonry
the
organisation
by
which
for
fifteen
years
past
the
whole
political
life
of
the
department
had
been
drawn
together
and
held
in
check
had
been
able
to
turn
the
masonic
lodges
of
the
department
into
boards
vested
with
the
preliminary
choice
of
candidates
for
public
offices
for
electoral
functions
and
for
party
favours
exercising
in
this
way
wide
and
definite
prerogatives
the
lodges
being
as
much
opportunist
as
they
were
radical
combined
acted
in
concert
with
one
another
and
worked
together
for
the
republican
cause
the
rejoicing
to
see
the
ambition
of
some
restraining
the
desires
of
others
gathered
together
on
the
joint
recommendation
of
the
lodges
a
band
of
senators
deputies
municipal
councillors
and
all
equally
loyal
to
the
government
yet
sufficiently
diverse
in
opinion
and
sufficiently
moderate
to
satisfy
and
reassure
all
republican
parties
save
the
socialists
had
brought
about
this
unanimity
and
now
the
radical
ministry
must
needs
break
up
so
happy
a
harmony
decreed
that
the
holder
of
one
of
the
minor
portfolios
either
agriculture
or
commerce
should
travel
through
the
department
and
stop
for
some
hours
in
the
county
town
it
sufficed
for
him
to
deliver
a
philosophic
and
moral
speech
at
one
assembly
to
flutter
all
the
assemblies
divide
each
lodge
into
two
set
brother
against
brother
and
infuriate
citizen
mandar
the
chemist
of
the

master
of
the

new
alliance
and
a
radical
against
tricoul
of
les
tournelles
master
of
the
lodge
sacred
friendship
and
an
opportunist
mentally
made
another
complaint
against
the
fallen
ministry
that
of
having
lavishly
distributed
academic
decorations
and
given
orders
of
merit
for
agricultural
proficiency
to
only
thus
robbing
the
of
the
advantage
of
governing
with
the
aid
of
these
decorations
or
at
least
by
means
of
tardily
fulfilled
promises
of
them
expressed
his
thoughts
accurately
as
alone
in
his
study
he
murmured
these
bitter
words
if
they
believed
they
could
play
at
politics
by
upsetting
my
loyal
lodges
and
fastening
my
useful
palms
to
the
tail
of
every
drunken
dog
in
the
department
they
ll
find
themselves
finely
mistaken
thus
it
was
that
he
heard
of
the
fall
of
the
ministry
without
any
regret
besides
these
changes
that
he
had
foreseen
never
surprised
him
his
administrative
policy
was
always
founded
on
the
assumption
that
minister
succeeds
minister
he
made
a
point
of
never
serving
a
home
secretary
with
ardent
zeal
he
refrained
from
being
to
any
one
and
shunned
all
opportunities
of
doing
too
well
this
moderation
kept
up
during
the
continuance
of
one
ministry
assured
him
the
sympathy
of
the
next
one
thus
sufficiently
predisposed
in
his
favour
to
acquiesce
in
its
turn
in
the
zeal
which
became
a
claim
to
the
favour
of
a
third
cabinet

where
the
french
home
office
is
situated
in
his
study
through
the
windows
of
which
came
the
scent
of
flowering
lilacs
and
the
twittering
of
sparrows
he
was
meditating
in
a
gentle
and
peaceful
mood
on
the
lingering
extinction
of
the
scandals
which
on
two
occasions
had
gone
near
to
ruining
the
leaders
of
the
party
he
looked
forward
to
the
day
still
far
distant
on
which
it
would
again
be
possible
to
resume
activity
he
reflected
that
in
spite
of
passing
difficulties
and
notwithstanding
the
discord
unluckily
communicated
to
the
masonic
lodges
and
the
electoral
committees
he
would
have
capital
municipal
elections
the
mayors
in
this
agricultural
district
were
excellent
the
spirit
of
the
populace
was
so
loyal
that
the
two
deputies
who
being
compromised
in
several
financial
transactions
were
threatened
with
legal
proceedings
had
yet
retained
all
their
influence
in
their
districts
he
said
to
himself
that
the
de
h
would
never
have
produced
such
favourable
results
in
his
exaltation
of
mind
thoughts
that
were
almost
philosophic
came
to
the
surface
of
his
mind
as
to
the
ease
with
which
men
can
be
governed
he
had
a
confused
vision
of
this
human
beast
allowing
itself
to
be
led
and
straggling
along
in
tireless
gloomy
tractableness
beneath
the
eye
of
the
shepherding
dog
h
in
which
each
voter
inscribes
on
his
paper
as
many
names
as
there
are
vacancies
to
be
filled
lacarelle
entered
the
study
with
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
monsieur
the
resignation
of
the
ministers
having
been
accepted
by
the
president
of
the
republic
is
announced
in
continued
his
gentle
musing
and
lacarelle
turned
up
his
long
gallic
moustaches
and
rolled
his
eyes
as
a
sign
that
he
was
about
to
give
expression
to
a
thought
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
so
opinions
differ
as
to
the
fall
of
the
really
asked
who
was
not
listening
well
monsieur
it
can
not
be
denied
that
mademoiselle
claudine
deniseau
predicted
that
the
ministry
would
fall
at
an
early
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
had
a
mind
wise
enough
to
see
that
there
was
nothing
marvellous
in
the
fulfilment
of
such
a
prophecy
but
lacarelle
with
a
profound
knowledge
of
local
affairs
a
marvellously
contagious
stupidity
and
an
exceptional
aptitude
for
immediately
related
to
him
three
or
four
new
stories
which
were
running
through
the
town
and
especially
the
story
of
de
gromance
to
whom
saint
radegonde
had
said
in
reply
to
her
visitor
s
secret
thought
be
at
ease
monsieur
the
child
that
your
wife
will
bear
is
really
your
then
lacarelle
returned
to
the
disclosure
of
the
hidden
treasure
two
roman
coins
had
been
found
at
the
place
indicated
the
excavations
were
still
going
on
there
had
also
been
some
cures
of
which
the
private
secretary
gave
vague
and
rambling
descriptions
listened
uncomprehendingly
the
mere
idea
of
the
deniseau
girl
saddened
and
worried
him
the
influence
of
this
visionary
over
the
townsfolk
at
large
was
beyond
his
understanding
he
was
afraid
of
using
his
abilities
ineffectively
in
a
psychic
case
such
as
this
this
fear
paralysed
his
reason
although
it
was
strong
enough
in
ordinary
circumstances
as
he
listened
to
lacarelle
he
experienced
a
dread
of
being
convinced
and
instinctively
exclaimed
brusquely
i
don
t
believe
in
such
things
as
these
i
don
t
believe
in
them
but
doubt
and
anxiety
overwhelmed
him
he
wished
to
know
what
abbé
guitrel
whom
he
regarded
as
both
learned
and
intelligent
thought
on
the
subject
of
this
prophetess
it
was
just
the
time
when
he
would
meet
the
abbé
at
the
goldsmith
s
house
he
went
to
rondonneau
junior
s
and
found
him
in
the
inner
room
nailing
up
a
case
whilst
abbé
guitrel
examined
a
vase
set
on
a
long
stem
and
surmounted
with
a
rounded
lid
that
s
a
fine
chalice
isn
t
it
monsieur
l
abbé
it
is
a
pyx
monsieur
a
ciborium
a
vessel
intended
ferendos
i
in
fact
the
pyx
holds
the
sacred
hosts
the
food
of
the
soul
formerly
they
used
to
keep
the
pyx
in
a
silver
dove
hung
over
the
baptismal
font
the
altar
or
the
tomb
of
a
martyr
this
one
is
decorated
in
the
style
of
the
thirteenth
century
an
austere
and
magnificent
style
very
suitable
monsieur
for
church
furniture
and
especially
for
the
sacred
i
to
bear
the
bread
was
not
listening
to
the
priest
whose
restless
crafty
profile
he
was
observing
here
is
the
man
thought
he
who
is
going
to
tell
me
about
saint
radegonde
and
the
and
the
departmental
representative
of
the
republic
was
already
screwing
up
his
courage
concentrating
his
energies
lest
he
should
appear
superstitious
and
credulous
before
an
ecclesiastic
yes
monsieur
said
abbé
guitrel
our
worthy
rondonneau
junior
has
executed
this
beautiful
specimen
of
goldsmith
s
work
after
ancient
models
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
they
could
not
have
done
better
in
the
place
in
paris
where
the
best
goldsmiths
are
to
be
monsieur
l
abbé
what
is
your
opinion
of
the
prophetess
whom
our
town
possesses
what
prophetess
monsieur
do
you
mean
that
poor
girl
who
pretends
to
be
in
communication
with
saint
radegonde
queen
of
france
alas
monsieur
it
can
not
possibly
be
the
pious
spouse
of
clotaire
who
suggests
to
that
miserable
girl
sorry
nonsense
of
every
kind
and
rhapsodies
which
being
irreconcilable
with
good
sense
are
still
less
to
be
reconciled
with
theology
foolery
monsieur
mere
foolery
who
had
prepared
some
subtle
jests
concerning
priestly
credulity
remained
silent
no
indeed
continued
guitrel
with
a
smile
it
is
incredible
that
saint
radegonde
should
suggest
this
trash
this
folly
all
these
silly
empty
sometimes
heterodox
speeches
that
fall
from
the
lips
of
this
young
maiden
the
voice
of
the
sainted
radegonde
would
have
another
accent
believe
le
préfet
very
little
is
known
in
fact
about
this
saint
guitrel
you
mistake
monsieur
you
mistake
saint
radegonde
reverenced
by
the
whole
catholic
church
is
the
object
of
special
worship
in
the
diocese
of
poitiers
which
was
formerly
witness
of
her
le
préfet
yes
as
you
say
monsieur
l
abbé
there
is
a
special
guitrel
even
atheists
themselves
have
regarded
this
great
figure
with
admiration
what
a
sublime
picture
monsieur
after
the
murder
of
her
brother
by
her
husband
clotaire
s
noble
spouse
betakes
herself
to
bishop
médard
at
noyon
and
urges
him
to
dedicate
her
to
god
taken
by
surprise
saint
médard
hesitates
he
urges
the
indissolubility
of
marriage
but
radegonde
herself
covers
her
head
with
the
veil
of
a
recluse
and
flings
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
pontiff
who
overcome
by
the
saintly
persistence
of
the
queen
and
braving
the
wrath
of
the
savage
monarch
offers
this
blessed
victim
to
le
préfet
but
monsieur
l
abbé
do
you
approve
of
a
bishop
defying
the
civil
powers
in
that
fashion
and
abetting
the
wife
of
his
overlord
in
her
revolt
the
deuce
if
these
are
your
opinions
i
shall
be
grateful
to
you
for
telling
me
guitrel
alas
monsieur
i
have
not
as
the
blessed
médard
had
the
illumination
of
sanctity
to
enable
me
to
discern
the
will
of
god
in
extraordinary
circumstances
luckily
nowadays
the
rules
which
a
bishop
should
follow
with
regard
to
the
civil
powers
are
definitely
defined
and
monsieur
will
kindly
remember
in
speaking
of
me
for
the
bishopric
of
tourcoing
to
his
friends
in
the
ministry
that
i
recognise
all
the
obligations
that
follow
from
the
concordat
but
why
intrude
my
humble
personality
in
these
great
scenes
of
history
saint
radegonde
clothed
in
the
veil
of
a
deaconess
founded
the
monastery
of
in
poitiers
where
she
lived
for
more
than
fifty
years
in
the
practice
of
a
rigorous
asceticism
she
observed
fasts
and
abstinences
with
such
scrupulousness
le
préfet
keep
these
stories
of
yours
monsieur
l
abbé
for
your
seminarists
you
don
t
believe
that
saint
radegonde
communicates
with
mademoiselle
deniseau
i
congratulate
you
on
that
and
i
could
wish
that
all
the
priests
in
the
department
were
as
reasonable
as
you
but
it
only
needs
this
hysteric
hysteric
she
attack
the
government
for
all
the
curés
to
come
in
herds
to
listen
and
applauding
to
all
the
insults
she
spits
guitrel
oh
they
make
reservations
monsieur
they
make
reservations
the
church
instructs
them
to
be
extremely
wary
in
face
of
every
fact
that
assumes
the
appearance
of
a
miracle
and
i
assure
you
that
for
my
part
i
am
very
distrustful
of
modern
le
préfet
tell
me
between
ourselves
you
don
t
believe
in
miracles
my
dear
abbé
guitrel
in
miracles
that
are
not
duly
verified
i
have
indeed
but
little
le
préfet
we
are
alone
confess
now
that
there
are
no
miracles
that
there
never
have
been
any
and
that
there
never
can
possibly
be
guitrel
not
at
all
monsieur
a
miracle
is
possible
it
can
be
unmistakably
recognised
it
is
useful
for
the
confirmation
of
doctrine
and
its
utility
is
proved
by
the
conversion
of
le
préfet
anyhow
you
grant
that
it
is
ridiculous
to
believe
that
saint
radegonde
who
lived
in
the
middle
ages
guitrel
in
the
sixth
century
in
the
sixth
le
préfet
exactly
in
the
sixth
century
should
come
in
to
gossip
with
the
daughter
of
a
on
the
political
programme
of
the
ministry
and
the
guitrel
communications
between
the
church
triumphant
and
the
church
militant
are
possible
history
supplies
numberless
undeniable
instances
of
it
but
yet
again
i
do
not
believe
that
the
young
person
of
whom
we
are
speaking
is
favoured
with
a
communication
of
this
kind
her
sayings
if
i
may
dare
to
say
so
do
not
bear
the
of
a
celestial
revelation
everything
she
says
is
somehow
le
préfet
guitrel
if
you
like
though
indeed
it
might
be
quite
possible
that
she
is
le
préfet
what
is
this
that
you
are
saying
you
an
intelligent
priest
a
future
bishop
of
the
republic
you
believe
in
possession
it
is
a
mediæval
superstition
i
have
read
a
book
by
michelet
on
guitrel
but
monsieur
possession
is
a
fact
recognised
not
only
by
theologians
but
also
by
scientists
atheists
for
the
most
part
and
michelet
himself
whom
you
quote
believed
in
the
cases
of
possession
at
le

what
notions
you
are
all
the
same
and
if
claudine
deniseau
were
possessed
as
you
say
guitrel
then
it
would
be
necessary
to
exorcise
le

exorcise
her
don
t
you
think
monsieur
l
abbé
that
that
would
be
absurd
guitrel
not
at
all
monsieur
not
at
le
préfet
what
does
one
do
guitrel
there
are
rules
monsieur
a
formulary
a
ritual
for
this
kind
of
operation
which
has
never
ceased
to
be
used
jeanne
d
arc
herself
had
to
undergo
it
in
the
town
of
vaucouleurs
unless
i
mistake
laprune
the
curé
of
would
be
the
right
person
to
exorcise
this
deniseau
girl
who
is
one
of
his
parishioners
he
is
a
very
venerable
priest
it
is
true
that
as
regards
the
deniseau
family
he
is
in
a
position
which
may
react
on
his
character
and
to
a
certain
extent
influence
a
wise
and
cautious
mind
as
yet
unenfeebled
by
age
or
which
at
any
rate
still
seems
able
to
bear
the
weight
of
years
and
the
fatigues
of
a
long
and
onerous
ministry
i
mean
to
say
that
events
regarded
by
some
as
miracles
have
taken
place
in
the
parish
of
this
worthy
curé
and
laprune
s
zeal
must
needs
have
been
led
into
error
by
the
thought
that
the
parish
of
may
have
been
privileged
to
such
a
degree
that
a
manifestation
of
divine
power
has
taken
place
in
it
in
preference
to
all
the
other
parishes
in
our
town
buoyed
up
by
such
a
hope
he
has
perhaps
formed
illusions
which
he
has
unconsciously
communicated
to
his
clergy
an
error
and
a
mistake
which
one
can
excuse
if
one
considers
the
circumstances
indeed
what
blessings
would
not
a
new
miracle
shed
on
the
parish
church
of
the
zeal
of
the
faithful
would
be
revived
by
it
an
outpouring
of
gifts
would
bring
wealth
into
the
famous
but
walls
of
the
ancient
church
and
the
favour
of
the
would
solace
the
last
days
of
laprune
now
arrived
at
the
end
of
his
ministry
and
le
préfet
but
if
i
understand
you
rightly
monsieur
l
abbé
it
is
this
doddering
cure
of
it
is
laprune
with
his
vicaires
who
has
got
up
the
affair
of
the
prophetess
undoubtedly
the
priests
are
strong
they
won
t
believe
it
in
paris
in
the
bureaux
but
it
is
the
truth
the
priests
are
a
fine
power
here
your
old
laprune
has
been
organising
these
séances
of
clerical
spiritualism
which
all
the
town
attends
in
order
to
hear
the
parliament
the
presidency
and
myself
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
they
don
t
spare
me
in
these
conventicles
of
the
place
guitrel
oh
monsieur
far
be
it
from
me
to
think
of
suspecting
the
worthy
curé
of
of
having
concocted
a
plot
on
the
contrary
i
sincerely
believe
that
if
he
has
in
any
way
encouraged
this
unhappy
affair
he
will
soon
recognise
his
error
and
will
use
all
his
influence
to
efface
the
results
of
it
but
even
in
his
interest
and
in
that
of
the
diocese
one
might
forestall
him
and
inform
his
eminence
of
the
real
facts
of
which
he
is
perhaps
still
ignorant
once
warned
of
these
disorders
he
will
doubtless
put
an
end
to
le
préfet
that
s
an
idea
my
dear
abbé
are
you
willing
to
undertake
the
commission
for
my
part
as
i
am
obliged
to
ignore
the
fact
that
there
is
an
archbishop
save
in
cases
provided
for
by
the
law
such
as
bells
and
processions
when
one
thinks
of
it
it
is
an
absurd
situation
for
from
the
moment
that
archbishops
have
an
actual
existence
but
politics
have
their
necessities
tell
me
frankly
are
you
in
favour
at
the
archbishop
s
palace
guitrel
his
eminence
sometimes
deigns
to
listen
to
me
with
kindness
the
affability
of
his
eminence
is
le
préfet
well
tell
him
that
it
is
inadmissible
for
saint
radegonde
to
come
to
life
again
in
order
to
plague
the
senators
the
deputies
and
the
of
the
department
and
that
in
the
interests
of
the
church
as
well
as
of
the
republic
it
is
time
to
bridle
the
tongue
of
the
fierce
clotaire
s
spouse
just
tell
his
eminence
guitrel
substantially
monsieur
substantially
i
will
tell
him
le
préfet
set
about
it
as
you
like
monsieur
l
abbé
but
prove
to
him
that
he
must
forbid
his
priests
to
enter
the
deniseau
house
that
he
must
openly
reprimand
the
curé
laprune
condemn
in
semaine
the
speeches
made
by
this
mad
woman
and
officially
request
the
editors
of
to
cease
the
campaign
they
are
waging
in
support
of
a
miracle
both
unconstitutional
and
contrary
to
the
guitrel
i
will
try
it
monsieur
certainly
i
will
try
it
but
what
am
i
a
poor
professor
of
sacred
rhetoric
before
his
eminence
the
le
préfet
he
is
intelligent
is
your
archbishop
he
will
understand
that
his
own
interests
and
the
honour
of
saint
radegonde
by
the
lord
guitrel
doubtless
monsieur
doubtless
but
his
eminence
so
devoted
to
the
spiritual
interests
of
the
diocese
perhaps
considers
that
the
prodigious
crowd
of
souls
around
this
poor
girl
is
a
token
of
that
yearning
after
belief
which
torments
the
younger
generation
a
proof
that
faith
is
more
living
than
ever
among
the
masses
an
example
in
fact
which
it
would
be
well
to
present
to
the
consideration
of
statesmen
and
it
is
possible
that
thinking
thus
he
may
be
in
no
hurry
to
cause
the
sign
to
cease
to
suppress
the
proof
and
the
example
it
is
possible
le
préfet
that
he
may
make
fun
of
everybody
he
is
quite
capable
of
guitrel
oh
monsieur
there
is
no
foundation
for
that
assumption
but
how
much
easier
and
more
certain
would
my
mission
be
if
like
the
dove
from
the
ark
i
were
the
bearer
of
an
olive
branch
if
i
were
authorised
to
just
in

whisper
monseigneur

poor

suspended
by

frontage

kept
its
carved
beams

several
months
of

de
terremondre
president
of
the
society
of
agriculture
and
archæology
proves
in
a
substantially
constructed
memoir
that
this
house
was
built
in
for
a
prominent
citizen
named
philippe

inattentive
take
pleasure
in
showing
the
canting
arms
of
philippe

carved
on
a
shield
held
by
two
angels
these
arms
which
de

has
judiciously
compared
with

of

represented
on
the
corbel

stands
over

figures
on
it

very
shadowy

are

recognisable

them
pointed
out

for
the
figure
of

woman
wearing
a
crown
which
leans
against

perpendicular
joist

found
no
difficulty
in
proving
that
it
must
be
regarded
as
a
saint

in
fact
there
may
still
be
made
out
at
the
feet
of
the
saint
the
remains
of
a
hideous
shape
which
is
none
other
than
that
of
the
devil

the
right
arm
of
the
principal
figure
which
is
lacking

to
hold
the
sprinkler
which
the
blessed
saint
shook
over
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
it
is
clear
what
saint
marguerite
typifies
in
this
place
now
that
mazure
the
archivist
of
the
department
has
brought
to
light
a
document
proving
that
in
the
year
philippe
tricouillard
then
about
seventy
years
of
age
had
lately
married
marguerite
larrivée
daughter
of
a
magistrate
by
a
confusion
which
is
not
very
surprising
marguerite
larrivée
s
celestial
patron
was
taken
for
the
young
princess
of
scotland
whose
sojourn
in
the
town
of

left
a
deep
impression

have
bequeathed

memory
more
full

house
originally
it
was
built
like
its
neighbour
with
a
wooden
front
and
the
visible
was
no
less
carefully
carved
but
in
paillot
s
father
bookseller
to
the
archbishopric
had
it
pulled
down
in
order
to
rebuild
it
simply
in
the
modern
style
without
any
pretence
at
wealth
or
art
merely
taking
care
to
make
it
convenient
as
a
and
place
of
business
a
tree
of
jesse
in
renaissance
style
which
covered
the
entire
front
of
paillot
s
house
at
the
corner
formed
by
the
place
and
the
rue

was
torn
down
with
the
rest
but
not
destroyed

upon
it

in

yard

it
for

in

cluster
on

damage

the
diocesan
architect
expatiates
on
these
mutilations
in
his
interesting
pamphlet
on
vandales
one
shudders
says
he
at
the
thought
that
this
precious
relic
of
an
age
of
faith
ran
the
risk
of
being
sawn
up
and
burnt
before
our
very
this
sentiment
being
expressed
by
a
man
whose
clerical
tendencies
were
well
known
was
trenchantly
criticised
by
in
an
anonymous
paragraph
in
which
was
recognised
rightly
or
wrongly
the
hand
of
the
archivist
of
the
department
mazure
in
twenty
words
said
this
paragraph
the
architect
of
the
diocese
supplies
us
with
several
occasions
for
surprise
the
first
is
that
any
one
should
be
able
to
shudder
at
the
mere
idea
of
the
loss
of
an
indifferently
carved
beam
and
one
so
much
mutilated
that
the
details
are
not
recognisable
the
second
is
that
this
beam
should
stand
to
quatrebarbe
whose
creed
is
well
known
as
a
relic
of
an
age
of
faith
since
it
dates
from
is
to
say
from
the
year
when
the
protestant
diet
of
augsburg
assembled
the
third
is
that
quatrebarbe
should
omit
to
say
that
the
precious
beam
was
torn
down
and
sent
to
the
by
his
own
nicolet
the
diocesan
architect
who
in
transformed
the
paillot
house
in
the
way
which
one
can
now
see
the
fourth
is
that
quatrebarbe
ignores
the
fact
that
it
was
none
other
than
mazure
the
archivist
who
discovered
the
carved
beam
in
clouzot
s
where
it
had
been
rotting
for
ten
years
under
quatrebarbe
s
very
nose
and
who
pointed
it
out
to
de
terremondre
president
of
the
society
of
agriculture
and
archæology
who
purchased
it
for
the
in
its
actual
condition
the
house
of
paillot
the
bookseller
showed
a
uniform
white
frontage
three
storeys
in
height

ornamented
with
woodwork
painted
green
bore
in
letters
of

the
words

boxes

called

not
so
deep

completed

to

quite
at
the

were
reserved

combined
in
his
shop
the
business
of
a
new
and
bookseller
this
dark
corner
of
the
old
books
attracted
the
bibliophiles
of
the
district
who
in
days
gone
by
had
found
there
a
certain
copy
of
the
first
edition
of
the
third
book
of
pantagruel
was
recalled
unearthed
in
excellent
condition
in
by
de
terremondre
father
of
the
present
president
of
the
agricultural
society
at
paillot
s
in
the
corner
there
was
still
more
mysterious
talk
of
a
mellin
de
containing
on
the
back
of
the
some
autograph
verses
by
marie
stuart
that
dutilleul
the
notary
had
found
about
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
place
and
for
which
he
paid
three
francs
but
since
then
no
one
had
announced
any
marvellous
discovery
the
gloomy
monotonous
corner
of
the
old
books
scarcely
changed
there
was
always
to
be
seen
there
abrégé

histoire

volumes
and
the
odd
volumes
of
kehl
s
voltaire
in
large
paper
dutilleul
s
discovery
doubted
by
many
was
by
some
openly
denied
they
based
their
opinion
on
the
idea
that
the
old
notary
was
quite
capable
of
having
lied
through
vanity
and
on
the
fact
that
after
dutilleul
s
death
no
copy
of
the
poems
of
mellin
de
was
found
in
his
library
yet
the
bibliophiles
of
the
town
who
frequented
paillot

shop
never
failed
to
explore
the
corner
at
least
once
a
month

one
of
the
most
assiduous
visitors

a
large
landed
proprietor

connected

a
connoisseur

preserved
a
slim
and
elegant
figure

was
very
popular
with
all
three
classes
in
the
county
town
and
they
had
several
times
offered
him
the
position
of
deputy
this
he
had
refused
declaring
that
his
leisure
as
well
as
his
independence
was
dear
to
him
and
people
were
curious
about
the
reasons
for
his
refusal

terremondre
had
thought
of
buying
queen
marguerite
s
house
in
order
to
turn
it
into
a
museum
of
local
archæology
and
offer
it
to
the
town
but
madame
houssieu
the
widowed
owner
of
this
house
had
not
responded
to
the
overtures
which
he
had
made
to
her
now
more
than
eighty
years
of
age
she
lived
in
the
old
house
alone
save
for
a
dozen
cats
she
was
supposed
to
be
rich
and
miserly
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
wait
for
her
death
every
time
that
he
entered
paillot
s
shop
de
terremondre
asked
the
bookseller
is
queen
marguerite
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
paillot
replied
that
assuredly
one
morning
she
would
be
found
dead
in
her
bed
living
shut
up
alone
at
her
age
meanwhile
he
dreaded
her
setting
his
house
on
fire
this
was
her
neighbour
s
constant
fear
he
lived
in
terror
lest
the
old
lady
should
burn
down
her
wooden
house
and
his
along
with
it
madame
houssieu
interested
de
terremondre
greatly
he
was
inquisitive
about
all
that
queen
marguerite
as
he
called
her
said
and
did
at
the
last
visit
which
he
had
paid
to
her
she
had
shown
him
a
bad
restoration
engraving
representing
the
duchess
of
angoulême
pressing
to
her
heart
the
portraits
of
louis
xvi
and
marie
antoinette
enclosed
in
a
medallion
this
engraving
set
in
a
black
frame
hung
in
the
showing
it
to
him
madame
houssieu
said
that
s
the
portrait
of
queen
marguerite
who
long
ago
lived
in
this
and
de
terremondre
asked
himself
how
a
portrait
of
of
france
had
even
by
the
dullest
of
minds
been
taken
for
a
portrait
of
margaret
of
scotland
he
meditated
on
it
for
a
month
then
one
day
he
exclaimed
as
he
entered
paillot
s
shop
i
ve
got
it
and
he
explained
to
his
friend
the
bookseller
the
very
plausible
reasons
for
this
extraordinary
confusion
listen
to
me
paillot
margaret
of
scotland
mistaken
for
marguerite
larrivée
is
confused
with
marguerite
of
valois
duchess
of
angoulême
and
this
princess
is
in
her
turn
confused
with
the
duchess
of
angoulême
daughter
of
louis
xvi
and
marguerite
of
duchess
of
duchess
of
angoulême
i
am
rather
proud
of
having
found
that
out
paillot
tradition
should
always
be
taken
into
account
but
when
we
own
queen
marguerite
s
house
we
will
furbish
up
the
memory
of
that
good
philippe
tricouillard
a
hard
upon
this
declaration
fornerol
entered
the
shop
with
the
wonted
impetuosity
of
that
indefatigable
visitor
of
the
sick
who
brought
with
him
hope
and
comfort
gustave
fornerol
was
a
fat
moustachioed
man
possessed
in
his
wife
s
right
of
a
small
country
estate
he
affected
the
fashions
of
a
country
proprietor
and
paid
his
visits
in
a
soft
hat
a
hunting
waistcoat
and
leather
leggings
although
his
practice
was
exclusively
among
the
lower
middle
class
and
the
rural
population
of
the
suburbs
he
was
considered
the
most
skilful
practitioner
in
the
town
friendly
with
paillot
as
with
all
his
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
paying
useless
visits
to
him
nor
of
wasting
his
time
gossiping
in
the
shop
this
time
however
he
sank
down
on
one
of
the
three
chairs
which
set
in
the
corner
had
gained
for
paillot
s
shop
the
reputation
for
a
hospitality
at
once
literary
learned
cultured
and
academic
he
puffed
waved
a
to
paillot
with
his
hand
bowed
with
some
deference
to
de
terremondre
and
said
i
am
tired
well
paillot
were
you
pleased
with
the
show
yesterday
what
did
madame
paillot
think
of
the
play
and
the
actors
the
bookseller
did
not
commit
himself
he
considered
that
it
is
wise
for
a
tradesman
to
express
no
opinions
in
his
shop
besides
he
went
to
the
theatre
only
and
that
but
seldom
but
fornerol
whose
position
as
medical
officer
to
the
theatre
procured
him
free
passes
never
missed
a
performance
a
travelling
company
had
given
the
night
before
with
pauline
giry
in
the
leading
part
she
is
always
capital
is
pauline
giry
said
the
doctor
that
s
the
general
opinion
said
the
bookseller
she
isn
t
as
young
as
she
once
was
said
de
terremondre
who
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
volume
xxxviii
of
histoire
générale
des
by
jove
no
answered
the
doctor
you
know
that
giry
isn
t
her
real
name
her
real
name
is
girou
answered
de
terremondre
authoritatively
i
knew
her
mother
clémence
girou
fifteen
years
ago
pauline
giry
was
dark
and
very
and
the
three
of
them
in
the
corner
set
to
work
to
reckon
the
actress
s
age
but
as
they
were
calculating
from
doubtful
or
incorrect
data
they
only
reached
contradictory
or
sometimes
even
absurd
conclusions
and
with
these
they
were
by
no
means
satisfied
i
am
worn
out
said
the
doctor
you
all
went
to
bed
after
the
theatre
but
i
was
called
up
at
midnight
to
go
to
an
old
farmer
on
duroc
hill
who
was
suffering
from
strangulated
hernia
says
his
man
to
me
he
has
brought
up
everything
he
can
he
harps
on
one
note
he
is
going
to
i
have
the
horse
put
in
and
i
spin
out
to
duroc
hill
over
yonder
right
at
the
end
of
the
faubourg
de
tramayes
i
find
my
man
and
howling
face
stercoraceous
vomiting
very
good
his
wife
says
to
me
it
s
in
his
inside
that
it
takes
she
s
is
pauline
giry
said
de
terremondre
it
s
quite
possible
said
paillot
at
least
answered
the
doctor
double
hernia
and
dangerous
it
was
very
good
i
proceed
to
reduce
it
by
although
it
is
only
necessary
to
exercise
a
very
faint
pressure
with
the
hand
after
thirty
minutes
of
this
business
one
s
arms
and
back
are
broken
and
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
five
hours
at
the
tenth
repetition
that
i
was
able
to
effect
the
at
this
point
in
the
narrative
recounted
by
fornerol
paillot
the
bookseller
went
to
serve
some
ladies
who
asked
for
some
interesting
books
to
read
in
the
country
and
the
doctor
addressing
himself
to
de
terremondre
alone
continued
i
was
one
ache
i
say
to
my
man
you
must
keep
to
your
bed
and
if
possible
you
must
remain
lying
on
your
back
until
the
has
made
a
truss
for
you
according
to
my
directions
lie
stretched
out
or
look
out
for
strangulation
and
you
know
whether
that
s
nice
without
counting
that
one
day
or
another
it
ll
carry
you
off
you
understand
yes
very
down
i
go
to
the
yard
to
wash
myself
at
the
pump
you
may
imagine
that
after
this
business
i
wanted
a
bit
of
a
wash
i
strip
myself
to
the
waist
and
i
rub
myself
with
soft
soap
for
maybe
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
dress
myself
again
i
drink
a
glass
of
white
wine
that
they
bring
me
in
the
yard
i
see
the
grey
dawn
break
i
hear
the
lark
sing
and
i
go
back
to
the
sick
man
s
room
there
it
was
dark
i
shout
in
the
direction
of
the
bed
hey
that
s
understood
isn
t
it
perfect
stillness
whilst
waiting
for
the
new
truss
the
one
you
have
is
no
good
at
all
d
you
hear
no
answer
are
you
asleep
then
i
hear
behind
me
the
voice
of
the
old
nurse
doctor
our
man
s
no
longer
in
the
house
she
tells
me
he
was
wearying
to
go
out
to
his
there
i
recognise
my
peasants
said
de
terremondre
he
lapsed
into
meditation
and
resumed
doctor
pauline
giry
is
now
she
made
her
at
the
vaudeville
in
she
was
then
i
am
sure
of
in
that
case
said
the
doctor
she
would
be
in
her
year
since
we
are
now
in
it
isn
t
possible
said
de
terremondre
for
she
is
at
least
six
years
older
than
rose
max
who
has
certainly
passed
her
fortieth
rose
max
i
don
t
say
no
but
she
is
still
a
fine
woman
said
the
doctor
he
yawned
stretched
himself
and
said
getting
back
from
duroc
hill
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
find
two
baker
s
men
in
my
hall
come
to
tell
me
that
their
mistress
the
baker
s
wife
of
the
tintelleries
has
been
brought
to
but
asked
de
terremondre
did
it
require
two
baker
s
men
to
tell
you
that
they
had
sent
them
one
after
the
other
answered
the
doctor
i
ask
if
the
characteristic
symptoms
have
set
in
they
give
me
no
answer
but
a
third
baker
s
man
turns
up
in
his
master
s
cart
up
i
get
and
seat
myself
at
his
side
we
take
half
a
turn
and
there
i
am
rolling
over
the
pavement
of
the
i
have
it
exclaimed
de
terremondre
who
was
pursuing
his
own
thoughts
it
was
in
that
she
came
out
at
the
vaudeville
and
it
was
in
that
my
cousin
courtrai
knew
her
and
was
intimate
with
are
you
speaking
of
jacques
de
courtrai
who
was
a
captain
of
dragoons
no
i
am
speaking
of
agénor
who
died
in
brazil
she
has
a
son
who
left
last
thus
spoke
de
terremondre
just
as
bergeret
professor
of
literature
at
the
university
entered
the
shop
bergeret
held
one
of
the
three
academic
chairs
of
the
paillot
establishment
and
was
the
most
indefatigable
talker
of
the
corner
there
with
a
friendly
hand
he
used
to
turn
over
the
leaves
of
books
old
and
books
new
and
although
he
never
bought
a
single
volume
for
fear
of
getting
a
wigging
for
it
from
his
wife
and
three
daughters
he
received
the
heartiest
welcome
from
paillot
who
held
him
in
high
esteem
as
a
reservoir
an
alembic
of
that
science
and
those
on
which
booksellers
live
and
flourish
the
corner
was
the
only
place
in
the
town
where
bergeret
could
sit
in
utter
contentment
for
at
home
madame
bergeret
chased
him
from
room
to
room
for
different
reasons
of
domestic
administration
at
the
university
the
dean
in
his
hatred
forced
him
to
give
his
lectures
in
a
dark
unhealthy
cellar
into
which
but
few
pupils
descended
and
all
three
classes
in
the
town
cast
black
looks
at
him
for
having
called
jeanne
d
arc
a
military
mascotte
now
bergeret
slipped
into
the
corner
gentlemen
anything
new
a
baby
to
the
baker
s
wife
in
the
tintelleries
said
the
doctor
i
brought
it
into
the
world
just
twenty
minutes
ago
i
was
going
to
tell
de
terremondre
about
it
and
i
may
add
that
it
wasn
t
without
this
child
replied
the
professor
hesitated
to
be
born
he
would
never
have
consented
to
it
if
being
gifted
with
understanding
and
foresight
he
had
known
the
destiny
of
man
on
the
earth
and
more
especially
in
our
it
is
a
pretty
little
girl
said
the
doctor
a
pretty
little
girl
with
a
raspberry
mark
under
the
left
the
conversation
continued
between
the
doctor
and
de
terremondre
a
pretty
little
girl
with
a
raspberry
mark
under
the
left
breast
doctor
it
would
seem
that
the
bakeress
had
a
longing
for
raspberries
when
she
took
off
her
corsets
the
mere
desire
of
a
mother
does
not
suffice
to
stamp
the
picture
of
it
on
the
offspring
she
bears
it
is
also
necessary
that
the
longing
woman
should
touch
one
particular
part
of
her
body
and
the
picture
will
be
stamped
on
the
child
in
the
corresponding
spot
isn
t
that
the
common
belief
doctor
that
is
what
old
women
believe
replied
fornerol
and
i
have
known
men
and
even
doctors
who
were
women
in
this
respect
and
who
shared
in
the
credulity
of
the
nurses
for
my
part
the
experience
of
an
already
long
practice
my
knowledge
of
observations
made
by
scientists
and
especially
a
general
view
of
embryology
prevent
my
sharing
in
this
popular
then
according
to
your
opinion
doctor
are
just
spots
like
others
that
form
on
the
skin
without
known
stop
a
bit
present
a
particular
characteristic
they
contain
no
and
are
not
erectile
like
the
tumours
with
which
you
might
perhaps
be
tempted
to
confuse
you
declare
doctor
that
they
are
a
peculiar
species
do
you
make
no
inference
from
that
as
to
their
origin
absolutely
but
if
these
spots
are
not
really
if
you
refuse
them
a
how
shall
i
put
it
a
psychic
origin
i
am
unable
to
account
for
the
accident
of
a
belief
which
is
found
in
the
bible
and
which
is
still
shared
by
such
a
great
number
of
people
my
aunt
pastré
was
a
very
intelligent
and
by
no
means
superstitious
woman
she
died
last
spring
aged
in
the
full
belief
that
the
three
white
currants
visible
on
the
shoulder
of
her
daughter
bertha
had
an
illustrious
origin
and
came
from
the
parc
de
neuilly
where
in
the
autumn
of
during
her
pregnancy
she
was
presented
to
queen
who
took
her
to
walk
along
a
path
bordered
by
to
this
fornerol
made
no
reply
he
was
not
remarkably
given
to
contradicting
the
opinions
of
rich
patients
but
bergeret
professor
of
literature
at
the
university
bent
his
head
towards
his
left
shoulder
and
gave
a
look
as
he
always
did
whenever
he
was
going
to
speak
then
he
said
gentlemen
it
is
a
fact
that
these
marks
called
reduce
themselves
to
a
small
number
of
types
which
may
be
classified
according
to
their
colour
and
form
into
strawberries
currants
and
raspberries
or
wine
and
coffee
spots
it
would
perhaps
be
convenient
to
add
to
these
types
that
of
those
diffused
yellow
spots
in
which
folks
endeavour
to
recognise
portions
of
tart
or
now
who
can
possibly
believe
that
pregnant
women
desire
nothing
save
to
drink
wine
or
au
or
to
eat
red
fruits
and
possibly
such
an
idea
runs
counter
to
natural
philosophy
that
desire
which
according
to
certain
philosophers
has
alone
created
the
world
and
alone
preserves
it
works
in
them
as
in
all
living
beings
only
with
more
range
and
diversity
it
gives
them
secret
fevers
hidden
passions
and
strange
frenzies
without
going
into
the
question
of
the
effect
of
their
particular
condition
on
the
appetites
common
to
all
that
lives
and
even
to
plants
we
recognise
that
this
condition
does
not
produce
indifference
but
that
it
rather
perverts
and
inflames
the
deeper
instincts
if
the
child
ought
really
to
carry
the
visible
signs
of
its
mother
s
desires
believe
me
we
should
more
frequently
see
imprinted
on
its
body
other
symbols
than
these
innocent
strawberries
and
drops
of
coffee
with
which
the
folly
of
old
wives
diverts
i
see
what
you
mean
said
de
terremondre
women
loving
jewels
many
children
would
be
born
with
sapphires
rubies
and
emeralds
on
their
fingers
and
with
gold
bracelets
on
their
wrists
necklaces
of
pearls
rivières
of
diamonds
would
cover
their
neck
and
breast
still
one
ought
to
be
able
to
point
to
such
children
as
just
so
replied
bergeret
and
taking
up
from
the
table
where
de
terremondre
had
left
it
the
volume
of
histoire
générale
des
the
professor
buried
his
nose
in
the
book
between
pages
and
a
spot
which
every
time
that
he
had
opened
the
inevitable
old
book
during
the
last
six
years
had
confronted
him
like
a
fate
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
page
as
an
instance
of
the
monotony
with
which
life
glides
by
a
symbol
of
the
uniformity
of
those
tasks
and
those
days
in
a
provincial
university
which
precede
the
day
of
death
and
the
travail
of
the
body
in
the
tomb
and
this
time
as
he
had
already
done
so
many
times
before
bergeret
read
in
volume
xxxviii
of
histoire
générale
des
the
first
lines
of
page
a
passage
to
the
north
it
is
to
this
check
said
he
that
we
owe
the
opportunity
of
being
able
to
visit
the
sandwich
isles
again
and
to
enrich
our
voyage
with
a
discovery
which
although
the
last
seems
in
many
respects
to
be
the
most
important
that
europeans
have
yet
made
in
the
whole
expanse
of
the
pacific
the
happy
prophecy
which
these
words
seemed
to
denote
has
unfortunately
never
been
and
this
time
as
always
the
reading
of
these
lines
plunged
bergeret
into
melancholy
whilst
he
was
immersed
in
it
the
bookseller
paillot
confronted
a
little
soldier
who
had
come
in
to
buy
a
sou
s
worth
of
with
disdain
and
hauteur
i
don
t
keep
declared
paillot
turning
his
back
on
the
little
soldier
then
he
complained
of
his
assistant
léon
who
was
always
on
errands
and
who
once
gone
out
never
came
back
consequently
he
paillot
was
constantly
being
pestered
by
intruders
they
actually
asked
him
for
i
remember
said
fornerol
to
him
that
one
a
good
came
in
and
asked
you
for
a
plaster
and
that
you
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
preventing
her
from
tucking
up
her
petticoats
and
showing
you
the
painful
spot
where
the
paper
was
to
be
paillot
the
bookseller
replied
to
this
anecdotic
sally
by
a
silence
which
expressed
offended
dignity
heavens
exclaimed
de
terremondre
the
this
learned
storehouse
of
our
fröben
our
elzevir
our
debure
confused
with
the
chemist
s
shop
of
thomas
diafoirus
what
an
outrage
indeed
replied
fornerol
the
good
soul
meant
no
harm
in
showing
paillot
the
seat
of
her
trouble
but
it
won
t
do
to
judge
the
peasants
by
her
in
general
they
show
extreme
repugnance
to
letting
themselves
be
seen
by
the
doctor
my
country
colleagues
have
often
remarked
this
to
me
attacked
by
serious
diseases
resist
examination
with
an
energy
and
obstinacy
which
townswomen
and
particularly
women
of
the
world
do
not
show
in
the
same
circumstances
i
saw
a
farmer
s
wife
at
lucigny
die
of
an
internal
tumour
which
she
had
never
allowed
to
be
de
terremondre
who
as
president
of
several
local
academies
had
literary
prejudices
took
these
remarks
as
a
pretext
for
accusing
zola
of
having
shamefully
maligned
the
peasants
in
at
this
accusation
bergeret
emerged
from
his
pensive
sadness
and
said
yet
the
peasants
are
drunkards
and
parricides
and
voluntarily
incestuous
as
zola
has
depicted
them
their
repugnance
to
lend
themselves
to
clinical
inspection
by
no
means
proves
their
chastity
it
only
shows
the
power
of
prejudice
in
minds
of
limited
intelligence
the
simpler
a
prejudice
is
the
stronger
is
its
power
the
prejudice
that
it
is
wrong
to
be
seen
naked
remains
powerful
with
them
it
has
been
weakened
amongst
artists
and
people
of
intelligence
by
the
custom
of
baths
douches
and
massage
it
has
been
still
further
weakened
by
æsthetic
feeling
and
by
the
taste
for
voluptuous
sensations
and
it
easily
yields
to
considerations
of
health
and
hygiene
this
is
all
that
can
be
deduced
from
the
doctor
s
i
have
noticed
said
de
terremondre
that
women
there
are
hardly
any
said
the
doctor
doctor
you
remind
me
of
my
chiropodist
replied
de
terremondre
he
said
to
me
one
day
if
you
were
a
chiropodist
sir
you
would
take
no
stock
in
paillot
the
bookseller
who
for
some
moments
had
been
glued
to
the
wall
listening
intently
said
i
don
t
know
what
is
going
on
in
queen
marguerite
s
house
i
hear
cries
and
the
noise
of
furniture
being
and
he
was
again
seized
with
his
customary
misgiving
that
old
lady
will
set
fire
to
her
house
and
the
whole
block
of
buildings
will
be
burnt
it
s
all
nobody
heeded
these
words
nobody
attempted
to
soothe
his
ridiculous
apprehensions
fornerol
rose
painfully
to
his
feet
stretched
the
wearied
muscles
of
his
arms
with
an
effort
and
went
off
on
his
round
of
visits
through
the
town
de
terremondre
put
on
his
gloves
and
took
a
step
towards
the
door
then
perceiving
a
tall
withered
figure
which
was
crossing
the
square
in
stiff
abrupt
strides
here
said
he
is
general
cartier
de
chalmot
i
hope
the
won
t
meet
and
why
not
demanded
bergeret
because
these
meetings
are
by
no
means
pleasant
for
last
sunday
our
while
driving
by
in
a
victoria
caught
sight
of
general
cartier
de
chalmot
who
was
walking
with
his
wife
and
daughters
lolling
back
in
his
carriage
with
his
hat
on
his
head
he
saluted
the
gallant
veteran
with
a
little
wave
of
his
hand
and
a
general
the
general
reddened
with
anger
for
the
unassuming
are
always
violent
in
their
anger
general
chalmot
was
beside
himself
he
was
terrible
before
all
the
promenaders
he
imitated
s
familiar
salute
and
shouted
at
him
in
a
voice
of
thunder
there
is
perfect
silence
now
in
queen
marguerite
s
house
said
paillot
xiii
the
midday
sun
darted
its
clear
white
rays
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
not
a
breath
in
the
air
the
solitary
orb
swung
across
the
vast
repose
in
which
everything
was
wrapped
and
urged
its
blazing
course
towards
the
horizon
on
the
deserted
mall
the
shadows
lay
still
and
heavy
at
the
foot
of
the
elms
a
slept
in
the
bottom
of
the
ditch
that
bounds
the
ramparts
the
birds
were
silent
seated
at
the
shady
end
of
a
bench
three
parts
steeped
in
sunlight
bergeret
forgot
under
these
classic
trees
in
the
friendly
solitude
his
wife
and
his
three
daughters
his
cramped
life
and
his
cramped
home
like
æsop
he
revelled
in
the
freedom
of
his
mind
and
his
analytical
imagination
roved
irresponsibly
among
the
living
and
the
dead
however
abbé
lantaigne
head
of
the
high
seminary
was
passing
with
his
breviary
in
his
hand
down
the
broad
walk
of
the
mall
bergeret
rose
to
offer
his
shady
place
on
the
bench
to
the
priest
lantaigne
came
up
and
sank
into
it
composedly
with
that
priestly
dignity
which
never
left
him
and
which
in
him
was
just
simplicity
bergeret
sat
near
him
at
the
spot
where
the
shadow
fell
mingled
with
light
from
the
feathery
end
of
the
branches
so
that
his
black
clothing
was
covered
with
golden
discs
and
over
his
dazzled
eyes
his
eyelids
began
to
blink
he
congratulated
abbé
lantaigne
in
these
words
it
is
said
everywhere
monsieur
l
abbé
that
you
will
be
called
to
the
bishopric
of
tourcoing
the
sign
i
hail
and
from
it
dare
to
hope
j
but
this
choice
is
too
good
a
one
not
to
make
one
doubtful
you
are
believed
to
be
a
royalist
and
that
counts
against
you
are
you
not
a
republican
like
the
pope
j
j
en
accepte
l
augure
et
j
ose
l
lantaigne
i
am
a
republican
like
the
pope
that
is
to
say
i
am
at
peace
and
not
at
war
with
the
government
of
the
republic
but
peace
is
not
love
and
i
do
not
love
the
bergeret
i
guess
your
reasons
you
condemn
it
for
being
freethinking
and
hostile
to
the
lantaigne
assuredly
i
condemn
it
as
irreligious
and
inimical
to
the
priests
but
this
irreligion
these
hostilities
are
not
inherent
in
it
they
are
the
attributes
of
republicans
not
of
the
republic
they
diminish
or
increase
at
every
change
of
ministers
they
are
less
than
they
were
yesterday
possibly
they
will
increase
perhaps
a
time
will
come
when
they
will
be
as
they
were
under
the
rule
of
marshal
macmahon
or
at
least
during
the
delusive
beginnings
of
that
rule
and
under
the
deceptive
ministry
of
may
they
are
accidental
not
essential
but
even
if
it
were
respectful
towards
religion
and
its
ministers
i
should
still
hate
the
bergeret
why
lantaigne
because
it
is
diversity
in
that
it
is
essentially
bergeret
i
don
t
quite
understand
you
monsieur
l
lantaigne
that
comes
from
your
not
having
the
theological
mind
at
one
time
even
laymen
received
some
impress
of
it
their
college
which
they
preserved
supplied
them
with
the
elements
of
philosophy
that
is
especially
true
of
the
men
of
the
seventeenth
century
at
that
time
all
those
who
were
educated
knew
how
to
reason
even
the
poets
it
is
the
teaching
of
that
underlies
the
of
racine
but
when
theology
has
been
relegated
to
the
seminaries
no
one
knows
how
to
reason
and
men
of
the
world
are
almost
as
foolish
as
poets
and
savants
did
not
de
terremondre
believing
that
he
was
speaking
to
the
point
tell
me
yesterday
on
the
mall
that
church
and
state
ought
to
make
mutual
concessions
people
no
longer
know
they
no
longer
think
empty
words
pass
and
repass
in
the
air
we
are
in
babel
you
monsieur
bergeret
are
much
better
read
in
voltaire
than
in
saint
bergeret
it
is
true
but
did
you
not
say
monsieur
l
abbé
that
the
republic
is
and
that
in
that
respect
it
is
essentially
bad
that
is
what
i
beg
you
to
explain
to
me
perhaps
i
might
succeed
in
understanding
you
i
know
more
theology
than
you
credit
me
with
in
hand
i
have
read
lantaigne
baronius
is
only
an
annalist
although
the
greatest
of
all
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
from
him
you
have
only
been
able
to
carry
away
some
historic
odds
and
ends
if
you
were
in
the
slightest
degree
a
theologian
you
would
be
neither
surprised
nor
disconcerted
at
what
i
have
just
said
diversity
is
hateful
it
is
the
characteristic
of
evil
to
be
diverse
this
characteristic
manifests
itself
in
the
government
of
the
republic
which
is
more
alienated
than
any
other
from
unity
with
its
want
of
unity
it
fails
in
independence
permanence
and
power
it
fails
in
knowledge
and
one
may
say
of
it
that
it
knows
not
what
it
does
although
for
our
chastisement
it
continues
yet
it
has
no
continuity
for
the
idea
of
continuity
implies
that
of
identity
and
the
republic
of
one
day
is
never
the
same
as
that
of
the
day
before
even
its
ugliness
and
its
vices
do
not
belong
to
it
and
you
have
yourself
remarked
that
by
them
it
has
never
been
discredited
reproaches
and
scandals
that
would
have
ruined
the
mightiest
empire
have
poured
over
it
harmlessly
it
is
indestructible
for
it
is
destruction
it
is
dispersion
it
is
discontinuity
it
is
diversity
it
is
bergeret
are
you
speaking
of
republics
in
general
or
only
of
our
own
lantaigne
obviously
i
am
considering
neither
the
roman
republic
nor
the
dutch
nor
the
swiss
but
only
the
french
for
these
governments
have
nothing
in
common
save
the
name
and
you
will
not
charge
me
with
judging
them
by
the
name
by
which
they
call
themselves
nor
by
those
points
in
which
they
seem
one
and
all
opposed
to
opposition
which
is
not
in
itself
necessarily
to
be
condemned
but
the
republic
in
france
means
nothing
more
than
the
lack
of
a
prince
and
the
want
of
a
governing
power
and
this
nation
was
too
old
at
the
time
of
the
amputation
for
one
not
to
fear
that
it
would
die
of
bergeret
yet
france
has
already
survived
the
empire
by
years
the
by
years
and
the
legitimate
sovereign
by
lantaigne
say
rather
that
for
a
century
france
wounded
to
death
has
been
dragging
out
a
miserable
remnant
of
life
in
alternate
fits
of
fever
and
prostration
and
do
not
imagine
that
i
flatter
the
past
or
base
my
regrets
on
lying
pictures
of
an
age
of
gold
which
never
existed
the
conditions
of
national
life
are
quite
familiar
to
me
its
hours
are
marked
by
perils
its
days
by
disasters
and
it
is
just
and
necessary
that
it
should
be
so
its
life
like
that
of
individual
men
if
it
were
exempt
from
trials
would
have
no
meaning
the
early
history
of
france
is
full
of
crimes
and
expiations
god
ceaselessly
chastened
this
nation
with
the
zeal
of
an
untiring
love
and
in
the
time
of
the
kings
his
mercy
spared
her
no
suffering
but
being
then
christian
her
woes
were
useful
and
precious
to
her
in
them
she
recognised
the
ennobling
power
of
chastisement
from
them
she
derived
her
lessons
her
merits
her
salvation
her
power
and
her
renown
now
her
sufferings
have
no
longer
any
meaning
for
her
she
neither
understands
them
nor
acquiesces
in
them
whilst
undergoing
the
test
she
rebels
against
it
and
the
demented
state
expects
good
fortune
it
is
in
losing
faith
in
god
that
one
loses
along
with
the
idea
of
the
absolute
the
knowledge
of
the
relative
and
even
the
historic
sense
god
alone
informs
the
logical
sequence
of
human
events
which
without
him
would
no
longer
follow
one
another
in
a
rational
and
conceivable
manner
and
for
the
last
hundred
years
the
history
of
france
has
been
an
enigma
for
the
french
yet
even
in
our
days
there
was
one
solemn
hour
of
hope
and
expectation
the
horseman
who
rides
forth
at
the
hour
appointed
by
god
and
who
is
called
now
shalmanezar
now
nebuchadnezzar
then
cyrus
cambyses
memmius
titus
alaric
attila
mahomet
or
william
had
ridden
with
fiery
trail
across
france
humiliated
bleeding
and
mutilated
she
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
may
that
moment
be
counted
to
her
for
righteousness
she
seemed
to
understand
and
along
with
her
faith
to
recover
her
intelligence
to
recognise
the
value
and
the
use
of
her
vast
and
providential
woes
she
aroused
her
just
men
her
christians
to
form
a
sovereign
assembly
then
appeared
the
spectacle
of
that
assembly
renewing
a
solemn
custom
and
consecrating
france
to
the
heart
of
jesus
we
saw
as
in
the
times
of
saint
louis
churches
rising
on
the
mountains
before
the
gaze
of
penitent
cities
we
saw
the
foremost
citizens
preparing
for
the
restoration
of
the
bergeret
the
assembly
of
bordeaux
the
of
montmartre
and
the
church
of
fourvières
at
lyons
the
commission
of
the
nine
and
the
mission
of
lantaigne
what
do
you
say
bergeret
nothing
i
am
filling
in
the
headings
in
the
sur
l
histoire
lantaigne
do
not
jest
and
do
not
deny
coming
along
the
roads
sounded
the
white
horses
that
were
bringing
the
king
to
his
own
again
henri
dieudonné
was
coming
to
the
principle
of
authority
from
which
spring
the
two
social
forces
command
and
obedience
he
was
coming
to
restore
human
order
along
with
divine
order
political
wisdom
along
with
the
religious
spirit
the
hierarchy
law
discipline
true
liberty
and
unity
the
nation
linking
up
its
traditions
once
more
was
recovering
along
with
the
sense
of
its
mission
the
secret
of
its
power
and
the
pledge
of
victory
god
willed
it
not
these
great
designs
thwarted
by
the
enemy
who
still
hated
us
after
having
satisfied
his
hatred
opposed
by
a
great
number
of
the
french
miserably
supported
even
by
those
who
had
formed
them
were
brought
to
naught
in
one
day
the
frontier
of
our
country
was
barricaded
against
henri
dieudonné
and
the
people
subsided
into
a
republic
that
is
to
say
they
repudiated
their
birthright
they
renounced
their
rights
and
their
duties
in
order
to
govern
themselves
according
to
their
own
inclinations
and
to
live
at
their
ease
in
that
liberty
which
god
curbs
and
which
overturns
both
law
and
order
the
temporal
images
of
himself
henceforth
evil
was
king
and
proclaimed
its
edicts
the
church
exposed
to
incessant
vexations
was
perfidiously
tempted
on
the
one
side
to
an
impossible
renunciation
and
on
the
other
to
revolt
involving
bergeret
you
doubtless
reckon
among
the
vexatious
measures
the
expulsion
of
the
fraternities
lantaigne
it
is
clear
that
the
expulsion
of
the
fraternities
was
prompted
by
evil
intentions
and
was
the
result
of
malicious
calculation
it
is
also
certain
that
the
religious
who
were
expelled
did
not
deserve
such
treatment
in
striking
them
it
was
believed
that
the
church
was
being
struck
but
the
blow
badly
aimed
strengthened
the
body
that
they
wished
to
shake
and
restored
to
the
parishes
the
authority
and
the
resources
which
had
been
diverted
from
them
our
enemies
did
not
know
the
church
and
their
chief
minister
of
that
time
less
ignorant
than
they
but
more
desirous
of
satisfying
them
than
of
destroying
us
made
a
war
on
us
that
was
merely
mimic
and
for
purposes
of
show
for
i
do
not
regard
the
expulsion
of
the
orders
as
an
effective
attack
of
course
i
honour
the
victims
of
this
clumsy
persecution
but
i
consider
that
the
church
of
france
has
in
the
secular
clergy
a
sufficient
staff
to
govern
and
minister
to
souls
without
the
help
of
the
regulars
alas
the
republic
has
inflicted
deeper
and
more
secret
wounds
on
the
church
you
know
too
much
about
educational
questions
monsieur

not
to
have
discovered
several
of
these
but
the
most
poisonous
one
was
induced
by
the
introduction
into
the
episcopate
of
priests
feeble
in
mind
or
in
character
i
have
said
enough
about
that
the
christian
at
least
consoles
and
reassures
himself
knowing
that
the
church
will
not
perish
but
what
will
be
the
patriot
s
consolation
he
discovers
that
all
the
members
of
the
state
are
gangrened
and
rotten
in
twenty
years
what
progress
in
corruption
a
chief
of
the
state
whose
sole
virtue
is
his
powerlessness
and
who
is
denounced
as
criminal
if
it
should
get
wind
that
he
ventures
to
act
or
even
merely
to
think
ministers
subject
to
a
foolish
parliament
which
is
believed
to
be
corrupt
and
whose
members
more
ignorant
every
day
were
chosen
moulded
nominated
in
the
godless
clubs
of
the
freemasons
to
carry
out
an
evil
policy
of
which
they
are
yet
incapable
and
which
is
surpassed
by
the
evils
brought
about
through
their
turbulent
inaction
an
incessantly
increasing
bureaucracy
vast
greedy
and
mischievous
in
which
the
republic
believes
she
is
securing
for
herself
a
band
of
supporters
but
which
she
is
nourishing
to
her
own
ruin
a
magistracy
recruited
without
law
or
equity
and
too
often
canvassed
by
the
government
not
to
be
suspected
of
obsequiousness
an
army
nay
a
whole
nation
unceasingly
pervaded
by
the
fatal
spirit
of
independence
and
equality
is
poured
back
straightway
into
town
and
country
a
whole
community
depraved
by
barrack
life
unfitted
for
arts
and
trades
and
disliking
all
labour
an
educational
body
which
has
a
mission
to
teach
atheism
and
immorality
a
diplomatic
corps
which
fails
in
readiness
and
authority
and
which
leaves
the
care
of
our
foreign
policy
and
the
conclusion
of
our
alliances
to
innkeepers
shopkeepers
and
journalists
in
a
word
all
the
powers
the
legislative
and
the
executive
the
judicial
the
military
and
the
civil
intermingled
confused
destroyed
one
by
the
other
a
farcical
rule
which
in
its
destructive
weakness
has
given
to
society
the
two
most
powerful
instruments
of
death
that
wickedness
ever
devised
divorce
and
malthusianism
and
all
the
evils
of
which
i
have
made
a
rapid
summary
belong
to
the
republic
and
spring
naturally
from
her
the
republic
is
essentially
unrighteous
she
is
unrighteous
in
willing
a
liberty
which
god
has
not
willed
since
he
is
the
master
and
since
he
has
delegated
to
priests
and
kings
a
part
of
his
authority
she
is
unrighteous
in
willing
an
equality
which
god
has
not
willed
since
he
has
established
the
hierarchy
of
dignities
in
heaven
and
on
earth
she
is
unrighteous
in
instituting
that
tolerance
which
can
not
be
the
will
of
god
since
evil
is
intolerable
she
is
unrighteous
in
consulting
the
will
of
the
people
as
if
the
multitude
of
ignorant
ought
to
prevail
against
the
small
company
of
those
who
bow
themselves
before
the
will
of
god
which
overshadows
the
government
and
even
the
details
of
administration
as
a
principle
whose
consequences
are
in
a
word
she
is
unrighteous
in
proclaiming
her
indifference
to
is
to
say
her
impiety
her
unbelief
her
blasphemies
of
which
the
very
smallest
is
mortal
sin
and
her
adhesion
to
diversity
which
is
evil
and
bergeret
did
you
not
say
just
now
monsieur
l
abbé
that
being
as
republican
as
the
pope
you
were
resolved
to
live
at
peace
with
the
republic
lantaigne
certainly
i
will
live
with
her
in
submission
and
obedience
in
rebelling
against
her
i
should
act
according
to
her
principles
and
contrary
to
my
own
by
being
seditious
i
should
resemble
her
and
i
should
no
longer
resemble
myself
it
is
unlawful
to
return
evil
for
evil
sovereignty
is
hers
whether
she
decrees
ill
or
does
not
decree
hers
is
the
guilt
let
it
rest
with
her
my
duty
is
to
obey
i
shall
do
it
i
shall
obey
as
a
priest
and
if
it
please
god
as
a
bishop
i
shall
refuse
nothing
to
the
republic
of
what
i
owe
her
i
call
to
mind
that
saint
augustine
in
hippo
then
besieged
by
the
vandals
died
a
bishop
and
a
roman
citizen
for
myself
the
lowest
member
of
this
illustrious
church
of
the
gauls
after
the
example
of
the
greatest
of
the
doctors
i
will
die
in
france

and

incline
their

whilst
a
ladybird
travelled
over

sleeve
of
his
coat
bergeret
replied
to
abbé
lantaigne
in
a
tone
of
the
greatest
affability
monsieur
l
abbé
you
have
just
traced
with
an
eloquence
only
to
be
found
on
your
lips
the
characteristics
of
democratic
rule
this
government
is
very
much
as
you
describe
it
and
yet
it
is
the
one
i
prefer
in
it
all
bonds
are
loosened
which
weakens
the
state
but
relieves
individuals
and
ensures
a
certain
ease
of
life
and
a
liberty
which
unfortunately
local
tyrannies
counteract
it
is
true
that
corruption
appears
to
be
greater
in
it
than
in
monarchies
that
springs
from
the
number
and
diversity
of
the
people
who
are
raised
to
power
but
this
corruption
would
be
less
visible
if
the
secret
of
it
were
better
kept
the
lack
of
secrecy
and
the
want
of
continuity
render
all
enterprise
impossible
in
a
democratic
republic
but
since
the
enterprises
of
monarchies
have
most
often
ruined
the
nations
i
am
not
very
sorry
to
live
under
a
government
incapable
of
great
designs
what
rejoices
me
especially
in
our
republic
is
the
sincere
desire
which
she
shows
not
to
provoke
war
in
europe
she
rejoices
in
militarism
but
is
not
at
all
bellicose
in
considering
the
chances
of
a
war
other
governments
have
nothing
to
fear
save
defeat
ours
fears
justly
victory
and
defeat
this
salutary
fear
secures
us
peace
which
is
the
greatest
of
blessings
the
worst
fault
of
the
present
is
that
it
costs
very
dear
it
makes
no
outward
show
it
is
not
ostentatious
it
is
gorgeous
neither
in
its
women
nor
its
horses
but
with
its
humble
appearance
and
neglected
exterior
it
is
expensive
it
has
too
many
poor
relations
too
many
friends
to
provide
for
it
is
a
spendthrift
the
most
grievous
point
is
that
it
lives
on
an
exhausted
country
whose
powers
are
waning
and
which
no
longer
thrives
and
the
administration
has
great
need
of
money
it
is
aware
that
it
is
in
difficulties
and
its
difficulties
are
greater
than
it
fancies
they
will
increase
still
more
the
evil
is
not
new
it
is
the
one
which
killed
the
old
i
am
going
monsieur
l
abbé
to
tell
you
a
great
truth
as
long
as
the
state
contents
itself
with
the
revenues
supplied
by
the
poor
as
long
as
it
has
enough
from
the
subsidies
which
are
assured
to
it
with
mechanical
regularity
by
those
who
work
with
their
hands
it
lives
happy
peaceful
and
honoured
economists
and
financiers
are
pleased
to
acknowledge
its
honesty
but
as
soon
as
this
unhappy
state
driven
by
need
makes
a
show
of
asking
for
money
from
those
who
have
it
and
of
levying
some
slight
toll
on
the
rich
it
is
made
to
feel
that
it
is
committing
a
horrible
outrage
is
violating
all
rights
is
wanting
in
respect
to
a
sacred
thing
is
destroying
commerce
and
industry
and
crushing
the
poor
by
touching
the
rich
no
one
hides
his
conviction
that
discredit
is
at
hand
and
it
sinks
beneath
the
genuine
contempt
of
the
good
citizen
yet
ruin
comes
slowly
and
surely
the
state
touches
capital
it
is
lost
our
ministers
are
jesting
at
us
when
they
speak
of
the
clerical
or
the
socialist
peril
there
is
but
one
peril
the
financial
peril
the
republic
is
beginning
to
recognise
this
i
pity
her
i
shall
regret
her
i
was
reared
under
the
empire
in
love
for
the
republic
she
is
justice
my
father
professor
of
rhetoric
at
the
college
of
used
to
say
to
me
he
did
not
know
her
she
is
not
justice
but
she
is
ease
monsieur
l
abbé
if
you
had
a
soul
less
exalted
less
serious
and
more
given
to
jesting
thoughts
i
should
confide
to
you
that
the
present
republic
the
republic
of
delights
me
and
touches
me
by
its
modesty
she
acquiesces
in
not
being
admired
she
exacts
but
a
trifling
respect
and
even
renounces
esteem
it
is
enough
for
her
to
live
that
is
her
sole
desire
it
is
a
lawful
one
the
humblest
beings
cling
to
life
like
the
woodcutter
of
the
fabulist
like
the
apothecary
of
mantua
who
so
greatly
astonished
that
young
fool
of
a
romeo
she
fears
death
and
it
is
her
only
fear
she
mistrusts
princes
and
soldiers
in
danger
of
death
she
would
be
very
ill
to
handle
fear
would
make
her
abandon
her
own
nature
and
would
render
her
ferocious
that
would
be
a
pity
but
as
long
as
they
make
no
attempt
on
her
life
and
as
long
as
they
only
attack
her
honour
she
is
a
government
of
this
kind
suits
me
and
gives
me
confidence
so
many
others
were
merciless
through
so
many
others
made
sure
of
their
rights
their
grandeur
and
their
prosperity
by
cruelties
so
many
others
have
poured
out
blood
for
their
prerogative
and
their
majesty
she
has
no
she
has
no
majesty
a
fortunate
lack
which
keeps
her
innocuous
to
us
provided
that
she
lives
she
is
content
she
rules
laxly
and
i
should
be
tempted
to
praise
her
for
that
more
than
for
all
the
rest
and
since
she
governs
laxly
i
forgive
her
for
governing
badly
i
suspect
men
at
all
times
of
having
much
exaggerated
the
necessity
of
government
and
the
benefits
of
a
strong
administration
certainly
strong
administrations
make
nations
great
and
prosperous
but
the
nations
have
suffered
so
much
all
through
the
centuries
for
their
grandeur
and
prosperity
that
i
fancy
they
would
renounce
it
glory
has
cost
them
too
dear
for
them
to
resent
the
fact
that
our
present
rulers
have
only
procured
for
us
the
colonial
variety
of
it
if
the
uselessness
of
all
government
should
at
last
be
discovered
the
republic
of
carnot
would
have
paved
the
way
for
this
priceless
discovery
and
one
ought
to
feel
some
gratitude
towards
it
for
that
taking
everything
into
consideration
i
feel
much
attached
to
our
thus
spoke
bergeret
professor
of
literature
at
the
university
abbé
lantaigne
rose
drew
out
from
his
pocket
his
handkerchief
passed
it
over
his
lips
returned
it
to
his
pocket
smiled
contrary
to
his
custom
secured
his
breviary
under
his
arm
and
said
you
express
yourself
pleasantly
monsieur
bergeret
just
so
did
the
rhetors
talk
in
rome
when
alaric
entered
it
with
his
visigoths
yet
under
the
terebinth
trees
of
the
esquiline
the
rhetors
of
the
fifth
century
let
fall
thoughts
of
less
vanity
for
then
rome
was
christian
you
are
that
no

l
abbé
replied
the
professor
be
a
bishop
and
not
the
head
of
the
it
is
true
monsieur
bergeret
said
the
priest
with
a
loud
laugh
that
if
i
were
head
of
the
university
i
should
forbid
you
to
be
a
teacher
of
and
you
would
do
me
a
great
service
for
then
i
should
write
in
the
papers
like
jules
lemaître
and
who
knows
whether
like
him
well
well
you
would
not
be
out
of
place
among
the
wits
and
the
french
academy
has
a
partiality
for
he
spoke
and
walked
away
with
a
firm
straight
heavy
tread
bergeret
remained
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
bench
which
was
now
covered
by
shade
the
ladybird
which
had
been
fluttering
its
on
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
flew
away
he
began
to
dream
he
was
not
happy
for
he
had
an
acute
mind
whose
points
were
not
always
turned
outwards
and
very
often
he
pricked
himself
with
the
of
his
own
criticism
anæmic
and
bilious
he
had
a
very
weak
digestion
and
enfeebled
senses
which
brought
him
more
disgust
and
suffering
than
pleasure
and
happiness
he
was
reckless
in
speech
and
in
unerringness
and
precision
his
tactlessness
attained
the
same
results
as
the
most
practised
skill
with
cunning
art
he
seized
every
opportunity
of
injuring
himself
he
inspired
the
majority
of
people
with
a
natural
aversion
and
being
sociable
and
inclined
to
fraternise
with
his
fellows
he
suffered
from
that
fact
he
had
never
succeeded
in
moulding
his
pupils
and
he
delivered
his
lectures
on
latin
literature
in
a
gloomy
damp
deserted
cellar
in
which
he
was
buried
through
the
dean
s
burning
hatred
of
him
the
university
buildings
were
however
spacious
built
in
these
new
premises
according
to
the
words
of
at
the
opening
testified
to
the
zeal
of
the
government
of
the
republic
for
the
diffusion
of
they
boasted
an
amphitheatre
decorated
by
léon
glaize
with
allegorical
paintings
representing
science
and
literature
where
compagnon
gave
his
lectures
on
mathematics
the
other
gownsmen
in
their
red
or
yellow
taught
different
subjects
in
handsome
rooms
bergeret
alone
under
the
bedel
s
ironic
glance
had
to
descend
followed
by
three
students
into
a
dusky
subterranean
hole
there
in
the
heavy
noisome
air
he
expounded
the
with
german
scholarship
and
french
subtlety
there
by
his
literary
and
moral
pessimism
he
afflicted
roux
of
bordeaux
his
best
pupil
there
he
opened
up
new
vistas
whose
aspect
was
terrifying
there
one
evening
he
pronounced
those
words
now
become
famous
but
which
ought
rather
to
have
perished
stifled
in
the
shadow
of
the
vault
fragments
of
differing
origins
soldered
clumsily
on
to
each
other
made
up
the
and
the
such
are
the
models
of
composition
that
have
been
imitated
by
virgil
by
fénelon
and
in
general
in
classic
literatures
by
writers
of
narratives
in
verse
or
in
bergeret
was
not
happy
he
had
received
no
honorary
distinction
it
is
true
that
he
despised
honours
but
he
felt
that
it
would
have
been
much
finer
to
despise
them
while
accepting
them
he
was
obscure
and
less
well
known
in
the
town
for
works
of
talent
than
de
terremondre
author
of
a
tourist
guide
than
general
milher
a
distinguished
miscellaneous
writer
of
the
department
less
even
than
his
pupil
albert
roux
of
bordeaux
author
of
a
poem
in
certainly
he
despised
literary
fame
knowing
that
that
of
virgil
in
europe
rested
on
a
double
misconception
one
absurd
and
the
other
fabulous
but
he
suffered
at
having
no
intercourse
with
writers
who
like
mm
faguet
doumic
or
pellissier
seemed
akin
to
him
in
mind
he
would
have
liked
to
know
them
to
live
with
them
in
paris
like
them
to
write
in
reviews
to
contradict
to
rival
perhaps
to
outstrip
them
he
recognised
in
himself
a
certain
subtlety
of
intellect
and
he
had
written
pages
which
he
knew
to
be
pleasing
he
was
not
happy
he
was
poor
shut
up
with
his
wife
and
his
three
daughters
in
a
little
dwelling
where
he
tasted
to
the
full
the
inconveniences
of
domestic
life
and
it
harassed
him
to
find
on
his
and
to
see
the
margins
of
his
manuscripts
singed
by
the
only
secure
and
pleasant
place
of
retreat
that
he
had
in
the
world
was
that
bench
on
the
mall
shaded
by
an
ancient
elm
and
the
corner
in
paillot
s
shop
he
meditated
for
a
moment
on
his
sad
condition
then
he
rose
from
his
bench
and
took
the
road
which
leads
to
the
bookseller
s
xiv
when
bergeret
entered
the
shop
paillot
the
bookseller
with
a
pencil
thrust
behind
his
ear
was
collecting
his
he
was
stacking
up
the
volumes
whose
yellow
covers
after
long
exposure
to
the
sunlight
had
turned
brown
and
become
covered
with
these
were
the
unsaleable
copies
which
he
was
sending
back
to
the
publishers
bergeret
recognised
among
the
returns
several
works
that
he
liked
he
felt
no
chagrin
at
this
having
too
much
taste
to
hope
to
see
his
favourite
authors
winning
the
votes
of
the
crowd
he
sank
down
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
in
the
corner
and
through
mere
habit
took
up
the
volume
of
histoire
générale
des
the
book
bound
in
green
leather
opened
of
its
own
accord
at
and
bergeret
once
more
read
these
fatal
lines
a
passage
to
the
north
it
is
to
this
check
said
he
that
we
owe
the
opportunity
of
being
able
to
visit
the
sandwich
isles
again
and
bergeret
sank
into
melancholy
mazure
the
archivist
of
the
department
and
de
terremondre
president
of
the
society
of
agriculture
and
archæology
who
both
had
their
chairs
in
the
corner
came
in
opportunely
to
join
the
professor
mazure
was
a
paleographer
of
great
merit
but
his
manners
were
not
elegant
he
had
married
the
servant
of
the
archivist
his
predecessor
and
appeared
in
the
town
in
a
straw
hat
with
battered
crown
he
was
a
radical
and
published
documents
concerning
the
history
of
the
county
town
during
the
revolution
he
enjoyed
inveighing
against
the
royalists
of
the
department
but
having
applied
for
academic
honours
without
having
received
them
he
began
invectives
against
his
political
friends
and
particularly
against
the
being
insulting
by
nature
his
professional
practice
of
discovering
secrets
disposed
him
to
slander
and
calumny
nevertheless
he
was
good
company
especially
at
table
where
he
used
to
sing
drinking
songs
you
know
said
he
to
de
terremondre
and
bergeret
that
the
uses
the
house
of
rondonneau
junior
for
assignations
with
women
he
has
been
caught
there
abbé
guitrel
also
haunts
the
place
and
appropriately
enough
the
house
is
called
in
a
of
the
house
of
the
two
but
said
de
terremondre
there
are
no
women
of
loose
life
in
the
house
of
rondonneau
they
are
taken
there
answered
mazure
the
archivist
talking
of
that
said
de
terremondre
i
have
heard
my
dear
monsieur
bergeret
that
you
have
been
shocking
my
old
friend
lantaigne
on
the
mall
by
a
cynical
confession
of
your
political
and
social
immorality
they
say
that
you
know
neither
law
nor
curb
they
are
mistaken
replied
bergeret
that
you
are
indifferent
in
the
matter
of
not
at
all
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
not
attach
any
special
importance
to
the
form
of
the
state
changes
of
government
make
little
change
in
the
condition
of
individuals
we
do
not
depend
on
constitutions
or
on
charters
but
on
instincts
and
morals
it
serves
no
purpose
at
all
to
change
the
name
of
public
necessities
and
it
is
only
the
crazy
and
the
ambitious
who
make
it
is
not
above
ten
years
ago
replied
mazure
that
i
would
have
risked
a
broken
head
for
the
republic
i
could
see
her
turn
a
somersault
and
only
laugh
and
cross
my
arms
the
old
republicans
are
despised
favour
is
only
granted
to
the
turncoats
i
am
not
referring
to
you
monsieur
de
terremondre
but
i
am
disgusted
i
have
come
to
think
with
bergeret
all
governments
are
they
are
all
powerless
said
bergeret
and
i
have
here
in
my
pocket
a
little
tale
which
i
should
very
much
like
to
read
to
you
i
have
founded
it
on
an
anecdote
which
my
father
often
related
to
me
it
proves
that
absolute
power
is
powerlessness
itself
i
should
like
to
have
your
opinion
on
this
trifle
if
you
do
not
disapprove
of
it
i
shall
send
it
to
the
de
de
terremondre
and
mazure
drew
their
chairs
up
to
that
of
bergeret
who
pulled
a
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
read
in
a
weak
but
clear
voice
a
deputy
magistrate
in
a
salon
of
the
tuileries
the
ministers
had
assembled
allow
me
to
listen
said
paillot
the
bookseller
i
am
waiting
for
léon
who
is
not
back
yet
when
he
is
out
he
never
comes
back
i
am
obliged
to
tend
the
shop
and
serve
the
customers
but
i
shall
hear
at
least
a
part
of
the
reading
i
like
to
improve
my
very
well
paillot
said
bergeret
and
he
resumed
a
deputy
magistrate
in
a
salon
of
the
tuileries
the
ministers
had
assembled
in
council
under
the
presidency
of
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
was
silently
making
marks
with
a
pencil
on
a
plan
of
an
industrial
town
his
long
sallow
face
with
its
melancholy
sweetness
had
a
strange
appearance
amid
the
square
heads
of
the
men
of
affairs
and
the
bronzed
faces
of
the
men
of
toil
he
half
raised
his
eyelids
glanced
with
his
gentle
vague
look
round
the
oval
table
and
asked
gentlemen
is
there
any
other
matter
to
be
discussed
his
voice
issued
from
his
thick
moustaches
a
little
muffled
and
hollow
and
seemed
to
come
from
very
far
off
at
this
moment
the
keeper
of
the
seals
made
a
sign
to
his
colleague
of
the
home
department
which
the
latter
did
not
seem
to
that
time
the
keeper
of
the
seals
was
delarbre
a
magistrate
in
virtue
of
his
birth
who
had
displayed
in
his
high
judicial
functions
a
becoming
pliability
abruptly
laid
aside
now
and
then
for
the
rigidity
of
a
professional
dignity
that
nothing
could
bend
it
was
said
that
after
having
become
an
ultramontane
and
a
member
of
the
empress
s
party
the
jansenism
of
those
great
lawyers
his
ancestors
sometimes
bubbled
up
in
his
nature
but
those
who
had
access
to
him
considered
him
to
be
merely
punctilious
a
trifle
fanciful
indifferent
to
the
great
questions
which
his
mind
did
not
grasp
and
obstinate
about
the
trifles
which
suited
the
pettiness
of
his
intriguing
character
the
emperor
was
preparing
to
rise
with
his
two
hands
on
the
gilt
arms
of
his
chair
delarbre
seeing
that
the
home
secretary
his
nose
in
his
papers
was
avoiding
his
look
took
it
upon
himself
to
challenge
him
pardon
me
my
dear
colleague
for
raising
a
question
which
although
it
started
in
your
department
none
the
less
concerns
mine
but
you
have
yourself
declared
to
me
your
intention
of
apprising
the
council
of
the
extremely
delicate
situation
in
which
a
magistrate
has
been
placed
by
the
of
a
department
in
the
the
home
secretary
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
slightly
and
looked
at
delarbre
with
some
impatience
he
had
the
air
at
once
jovial
and
choleric
which
belongs
to
great
demagogues
oh
said
he
that
was
gossip
ridiculous
a
rumour
which
i
should
be
ashamed
to
bring
to
the
notice
of
the
emperor
were
it
not
that
my
colleague
the
minister
of
justice
seems
to
attach
an
importance
to
it
which
for
my
part
i
have
not
succeeded
in
napoleon
began
sketching
once
more
it
has
to
do
with
the
of
continued
the
minister
this
official
is
reputed
in
his
department
to
be
a
gallant
squire
of
dames
and
the
reputation
for
gallantry
which
has
become
attached
to
his
name
combined
with
his
courtesy
and
his
devotion
to
the
government
has
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
popularity
which
he
enjoys
in
the
country
his
attentions
to
madame
méreau
the
wife
of
the
have
been
noticed
and
commented
on
i
grant
that
pélisson
the
has
given
occasion
for
scandalous
gossip
in
nantes
and
that
severe
charges
have
been
laid
to
his
account
in
the
bourgeois
circles
of
the
county
town
especially
in
the
frequented
by
the
magistracy
assuredly
pélisson
s
attitude
towards
madame
méreau
whose
position
ought
to
have
protected
her
from
any
such
equivocal
attentions
would
be
regrettable
if
it
were
continued
but
the
information
i
have
received
enables
me
to
state
that
madame
méreau
has
not
been
actually
compromised
and
that
no
scandal
is
to
be
anticipated
a
little
prudence
and
circumspection
will
suffice
to
prevent
this
affair
having
any
annoying
having
spoken
in
these
terms
the
home
secretary
closed
his
portfolio
and
leant
back
in
his
chair
the
emperor
said
nothing
excuse
me
my
dear
colleague
said
the
keeper
of
the
seals
drily
the
wife
of
the
of
the
court
of
nantes
is
the
mistress
of
the
of
this
connection
known
throughout
the
whole
district
is
calculated
to
injure
the
prestige
of
the
magistracy
it
is
important
to
call
the
attention
of
his
majesty
to
this
state
of
doubtless
replied
the
home
secretary
his
gaze
turned
towards
the
allegories
on
the
ceiling
doubtless
such
facts
are
to
be
regretted
yet
one
must
in
no
way
exaggerate
it
is
possible
that
the
of
may
have
been
a
little
imprudent
and
madame
méreau
a
little
giddy
but
the
minister
wafted
the
rest
of
his
ideas
towards
the
mythological
figures
which
floated
across
the
painted
sky
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
during
which
one
could
hear
the
impudent
chirping
of
the
sparrows
perched
on
the
trees
in
the
garden
and
on
the
eaves
of
the
château
delarbre
bit
his
thin
lips
and
pulled
his
austere
but
coquettish
moustaches
he
replied
excuse
my
persistence
the
secret
reports
which
i
have
received
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
pélisson
and
madame
méreau
these
relations
were
already
established
two
years
ago
in
fact
in
the
month
of
september
the
of
got
the
an
invitation
to
hunt
with
the
comte
de
morainville
deputy
for
the
third
division
in
the
department
and
during
the
magistrate
s
absence
he
entered
madame
méreau
s
room
he
got
in
by
way
of
the
the
next
day
the
gardener
saw
traces
that
the
wall
had
been
scaled
and
informed
the
police
inquiry
was
made
they
even
arrested
a
tramp
who
not
being
able
to
prove
his
innocence
endured
several
months
of
precautionary
imprisonment
he
had
it
is
true
a
very
bad
record
and
no
special
points
of
interest
about
him
still
to
this
day
the
persists
supported
by
a
very
small
proportion
of
the
public
in
believing
him
to
be
guilty
of
the
position
i
repeat
is
rendered
by
this
fact
no
less
annoying
and
prejudicial
to
the
prestige
of
the
the
home
secretary
poured
over
the
discussion
according
to
his
wont
certain
massive
phrases
calculated
to
close
and
suppress
it
by
their
weight
he
held
said
he
his
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
would
be
able
to
lead
pélisson
easily
to
a
just
appreciation
of
things
without
taking
any
drastic
measure
against
an
intelligent
and
zealous
official
who
had
succeeded
in
his
department
and
who
was
valuable
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
electoral
no
one
could
say
that
he
was
more
interested
than
the
home
secretary
in
maintaining
a
good
understanding
between
the
officials
of
the
departments
and
the
judicial
authority
still
the
emperor
kept
that
dreamy
look
in
which
he
was
usually
wrapped
when
silent
he
was
evidently
thinking
of
past
events
for
he
suddenly
said
poor
pélisson
i
knew
his
father
he
was
called
anacharsis
pélisson
he
was
the
son
of
a
republican
of
himself
a
republican
he
used
to
write
in
the
opposition
papers
during
the
july
administration
at
the
time
of
my
captivity
in
the
fortress
of
ham
he
addressed
a
friendly
letter
to
me
you
can
not
imagine
the
joy
which
the
slightest
token
of
sympathy
gives
a
prisoner
after
that
we
went
on
our
separate
paths
we
never
saw
one
another
again
he
is
the
emperor
lit
a
cigarette
and
remained
wrapped
in
his
dream
for
a
moment
then
rising
gentlemen
i
will
not
detain
with
the
awkward
gait
of
a
great
winged
bird
when
it
walks
he
returned
to
his
private
apartments
and
the
ministers
went
out
one
after
the
other
through
the
long
suite
of
rooms
beneath
the
solemn
gaze
of
the
ushers
the
marshal
who
was
the
minister
of
war
held
out
his
to
the
keeper
of
the
seals
monsieur
delarbre
shall
we
take
a
little
walk
outside
i
want
to
stretch
my
whilst
they
were
both
walking
down
the
rue
de
rivoli
by
the
railing
that
borders
the
terrasse
des
feuillants
speaking
of
cigars
said
the
marshal
i
only
like
very
dry
cigars
the
others
seem
like
sweetmeats
to
me
don
t
you
know
he
cut
short
his
thought
then
this
pélisson
that
you
were
talking
about
just
now
in
the
council
isn
t
he
a
little
dried
up
swarthy
man
who
was
at
five
years
ago
delarbre
replied
that
pélisson
had
indeed
been
in
the
vosges
so
i
said
to
myself
i
knew
pélisson
and
i
remember
madame
pélisson
very
well
i
sat
next
to
her
at
dinner
at
when
i
went
there
for
the
unveiling
of
a
monument
don
t
you
know
what
kind
of
woman
is
she
asked
delarbre
tiny
swarthy
thin
a
deceptive
thinness
in
the
morning
in
a
dress
she
looked
a
mere
wisp
at
table
in
the
evening
in
a
dress
with
flowers
in
her
bosom
very
but
morally
marshal
morally
i
am
not
an
imbecile
am
i
now
well
i
have
never
understood
anything
about
a
woman
s
morals
all
that
i
can
tell
you
is
that
madame
pélisson
passed
for
a
sentimentalist
they
said
she
had
a
warm
heart
for
handsome
she
gave
you
a
hint
to
that
effect
my
dear
marshal
not
the
least
in
the
world
she
said
to
me
at
dessert
i
dote
on
eloquence
a
noble
speech
carries
me
i
could
not
apply
that
remark
to
myself
it
is
true
that
i
had
that
morning
delivered
an
address
but
i
had
got
my
a
artillery
officer
to
write
it
out
for
me
he
had
written
so
small
that
i
could
not
read
it
don
t
you
know
they
had
reached
the
place
vendôme
delarbre
held
out
his
little
withered
hand
to
the
marshal
and
stole
under
the
archway
of
the
ministry
the
following
week
at
the
breaking
up
of
the
council
when
the
ministers
were
already
withdrawing
the
emperor
laid
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
my
dear
monsieur
delarbre
said
he
to
him
i
have
heard
by
my
position
one
never
learns
anything
save
by
there
is
a
deputy
magistrate
s
post
vacant
at
the
nantes
bar
i
beg
that
you
will
consider
for
that
post
a
very
deserving
young
doctor
of
law
who
has
written
a
remarkable
treatise
on
trade
unions
his
name
is
chanot
and
he
is
the
nephew
of
madame
ramel
he
is
to
beg
an
audience
of
you
this
very
day
should
you
propose
him
to
me
for
it
i
shall
sign
his
nomination
with
the
emperor
had
pronounced
the
name
of
his
tenderly
for
he
had
never
lost
his
affection
for
her
although
a
republican
of
republicans
she
repelled
his
advances
refused
poor
widow
as
she
was
the
master
s
offers
and
raged
openly
in
her
garret
against
the
d
but
yielding
at
last
after
fifteen
years
to
the
persistent
kindness
of
napoleon
she
had
come
to
beg
as
earnest
of
reconciliation
a
favour
from
the
for
herself
but
for
her
nephew
young
chanot
a
doctor
of
law
and
according
to
his
professors
an
honour
to
the
schools
even
now
it
was
an
austere
favour
that
madame
ramel
demanded
of
her
admission
to
the
open
court
for
young
chanot
could
scarcely
be
considered
an
act
of
partiality
but
madame
ramel
was
keenly
anxious
that
her
nephew
should
be
sent
to
where
his
relatives
lived
this
fact
recurred
to
napoleon
s
mind
and
he
impressed
it
on
the
minister
of
justice
it
is
very
important
said
he
that
my
candidate
should
be
nominated
at
nantes
for
that
is
his
native
place
and
where
his
parents
live
that
is
an
important
consideration
for
a
young
man
whose
means
are
small
and
who
likes
family
chanot
meritorious
and
with
small
means
answered
the
minister
he
added
that
he
would
use
his
best
endeavours
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
desire
expressed
by
his
majesty
his
only
fear
was
lest
the
should
have
already
submitted
to
him
a
list
of
proposed
nominees
among
whom
naturally
the
name
chanot
would
not
occur
this
was
indeed
méreau
concerning
whom
there
had
been
a
discussion
in
the
preceding
council
the
keeper
of
the
seals
was
particularly
anxious
to
act
very
handsomely
towards
him
but
he
would
strain
every
nerve
to
bring
this
affair
to
an
issue
that
conformed
with
the
intentions
expressed
by
his
majesty
he
bowed
and
took
his
leave
it
was
his
reception
day
as
soon
as
he
had
entered
his
study
he
asked
his
secretary
labarthe
whether
there
were
many
people
in
the
there
were
two
presidents
of
courts
a
councillor
of
the
appeal
court
the
of
nicomedia
a
crowd
of
judges
barristers
and
priests
the
minister
asked
if
there
was
any
one
there
called
chanot
labarthe
searched
in
the
silver
salver
and
discovered
among
the
pile
of
cards
that
of
chanot
doctor
of
law
prizeman
of
the
faculty
of
law
paris
the
minister
ordered
him
to
be
called
first
merely
requesting
that
he
should
be
conducted
by
the
back
passages
in
order
not
to
offend
the
magistrates
and
clergy
the
minister
seated
himself
at
his
table
and
murmured
quite
to
himself
a
sentimentalist
said
the
marshal
with
a
warm
heart
for
handsome
men
who
speak
the
usher
introduced
into
the
study
a
huge
tall
young
man
stooping
spectacled
and
with
a
pointed
skull
every
part
of
his
uncouth
frame
expressed
at
once
the
timidity
of
the
recluse
and
the
boldness
of
the
thinker
the
keeper
of
the
seals
examined
him
from
head
to
foot
and
saw
that
he
had
the
cheeks
of
a
child
and
no
shoulders
he
signed
to
him
to
sit
down
the
suitor
having
perched
himself
at
the
edge
of
the
chair
shut
his
eyes
and
began
to
pour
forth
a
flood
of
words
monsieur
i
come
to
beg
from
your
noble
patronage
the
privilege
of
admission
to
the
magistracy
possibly
your
excellence
may
consider
that
the
reports
i
have
gained
in
the
various
examinations
which
i
have
undergone
and
a
prize
which
has
been
awarded
to
me
for
a
work
on
trade
unions
are
sufficient
qualifications
and
that
the
nephew
of
madame
ramel
of
the
emperor
is
not
altogether
unworthy
the
keeper
of
the
seals
stopped
him
with
a
wave
of
his
little
yellow
hand
doubtless
monsieur
chanot
doubtless
an
august
patronage
which
would
never
have
been
mistakenly
bestowed
on
an
unworthy
recipient
has
been
secured
for
you
i
know
it
the
emperor
takes
much
interest
in
you
you
desire
a
chair
as
monsieur
chanot
your
excellence
replied
chanot
would
put
the
finishing
touch
to
my
wishes
by
nominating
me
deputy
magistrate
at
nantes
where
my
family
delarbre
fixed
his
leaden
eyes
on
chanot
and
said
drily
there
is
no
vacancy
at
the
bar
of
excuse
me
your
excellency
i
thought
the
minister
rose
there
is
none
and
whilst
chanot
was
making
clumsily
for
the
door
and
looking
for
an
exit
in
the
white
panels
as
he
made
his
bow
the
keeper
of
the
seals
said
to
him
with
a
persuasive
air
and
almost
in
a
confidential
tone
trust
me
monsieur
chanot
and
dissuade
your
aunt
from
making
any
new
solicitations
which
far
from
being
of
any
profit
to
you
will
only
do
you
harm
rest
assured
that
the
emperor
takes
an
interest
in
you
and
rely
on
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
the
minister
called
his
secretary
labarthe
bring
me
your
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
labarthe
entered
a
house
in
the
rue
jacob
mounted
the
staircase
as
far
as
the
attics
and
called
from
the
landing
are
you
ready
lespardat
the
door
of
a
little
garret
opened
inside
on
a
shelf
there
were
several
and
tattered
novels
on
the
bed
a
black
velvet
mask
with
a
fall
of
lace
a
bunch
of
withered
violets
and
some
fencing
foils
on
the
wall
a
bad
portrait
of
mirabeau
a
engraving
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
big
bronzed
fellow
was
brandishing
he
had
frizzled
hair
a
low
forehead
hazel
eyes
full
of
laughter
and
sweetness
a
nose
that
quivered
like
the
nostrils
of
a
horse
and
in
his
pleasantly
gaping
mouth
strong
white
teeth
i
was
waiting
for
you
said
he
labarthe
begged
him
to
dress
himself
he
was
hungry
what
time
would
they
get
their
dinner
lespardat
having
laid
his
on
the
floor
pulled
off
his
jersey
and
showed
the
herculean
nape
that
carried
his
round
head
on
his
broad
shoulders
he
looks
at
least
thought
labarthe
as
soon
as
lespardat
had
put
on
his
coat
the
thin
cloth
of
which
allowed
one
to
follow
the
powerful
easy
play
of
the
muscles
labarthe
pushed
him
outside
we
shall
be
at
magny
s
in
three
minutes
i
have
the
minister
s
as
they
had
matters
to
discuss
they
asked
for
a
private
room
at
the
restaurant
after
the
sole
and
the
labarthe
attacked
his
subject
bluntly
listen
to
me
carefully
lespardat
you
will
see
my
chief
your
nomination
will
be
proposed
by
the
of
nantes
on
thursday
and
on
monday
submitted
for
the
signature
of
the
emperor
it
is
arranged
that
it
shall
be
given
to
him
unexpectedly
at
the
moment
when
he
will
be
busy
with
alfred
maury
in
fixing
the
site
of
alesia
when
he
is
studying
the
topography
of
the
gauls
in
the
time
of
cæsar
the
emperor
signs
everything
they
want
him
to
but
understand
clearly
what
is
expected
from
you
you
must
win
the
favour
of
madame
you
must
win
from
her
the
ultimate
favour
it
is
only
by
this
consummation
that
the
magistracy
will
be
lespardat
swallowed
and
listened
pleased
and
smiling
in
his
ingenuous
but
said
he
what
notion
has
budded
in
delarbre
s
head
i
thought
he
was
a
labarthe
raising
his
knife
stopped
him
first
of
all
my
friend
i
beg
that
you
will
not
compromise
my
chief
who
must
remain
ignorant
of
all
that
s
going
on
here
but
since
you
have
brought
in
delarbre
s
name
i
will
tell
you
that
his
puritanism
is
a
jansenist
puritanism
he
is
a
of
deacon
pâris
his
maternal
was
that
carré
de
montgeron
who
defended
the
fanatics
of
s
cloister
k
before
the
parliament
now
the
jansenists
love
to
practise
their
austerities
in
nooks
and
crannies
they
have
a
taste
for
diplomatic
and
canonical
blackguardism
it
is
the
effect
of
their
perfect
purity
and
then
they
read
the
bible
the
old
testament
is
full
of
stories
of
the
same
kind
as
yours
my
dear
k
in
miracles
were
claimed
by
the
jansenists
to
have
been
worked
in
the
cemetery
of
médard
paris
at
the
grave
of
françois
de
pâris
a
young
jansenist
deacon
the
spot
became
a
place
of
pilgrimage
and
was
visited
by
thousands
of
jansenist
fanatics
lespardat
was
not
listening
he
was
floating
in
a
sea
of
naïve
delight
he
was
asking
himself
what
will
father
say
what
will
mother
say
thinking
of
his
parents
grocers
of
large
ambitions
and
little
wealth
at
agen
and
he
vaguely
associated
his
budding
fortune
with
the
glory
of
mirabeau
his
favourite
hero
since
his
college
days
he
had
dreamt
of
a
destiny
rich
with
women
and
feats
of
oratory
labarthe
recalled
his
young
friend
s
attention
to
himself
you
know
monsieur
you
are
not
irremovable
if
after
a
reasonable
interval
you
have
not
made
yourself
very
agreeable
to
madame
mean
completely
fall
into
but
asked
lespardat
frankly
how
much
time
do
you
give
me
to
make
myself
excessively
pleasing
to
madame
pélisson
until
the
vacation
answered
the
minister
s
secretary
gravely
we
give
you
in
addition
all
sorts
of
facilities
secret
missions
furloughs
everything
except
money
above
all
we
are
an
honest
administration
people
don
t
believe
it
but
later
on
they
will
find
that
we
were
no
jobbers
take
delarbre
he
has
clean
hands
besides
the
home
office
which
is
on
the
husband
s
side
controls
the
secret
service
money
do
not
count
on
anything
save
your
two
thousand
four
hundred
francs
of
salary
and
your
handsome
face
to
captivate
madame
is
she
pretty
this
of
mine
demanded
lespardat
he
asked
this
question
carelessly
without
exaggerating
the
importance
of
it
placidly
as
behoves
a
very
young
man
who
finds
all
women
beautiful
by
way
of
reply
labarthe
threw
on
the
table
the
photograph
of
a
thin
lady
in
a
round
hat
with
a
double
bandeau
falling
on
her
brown
neck
here
said
he
is
the
portrait
of
madame
pélisson
it
was
ordered
by
the
cabinet
from
the
prefecture
of
police
and
they
sent
it
on
after
they
had
stamped
it
with
a
warranty
stamp
as
you
lespardat
seized
it
eagerly
with
his
square
fingers
she
is
handsome
said
he
have
you
a
plan
asked
labarthe
a
methodical
scheme
of
no
answered
lespardat
simply
labarthe
who
was
protested
that
it
was
however
necessary
to
foresee
to
arrange
not
to
allow
oneself
to
be
taken
unawares
by
any
contingencies
you
are
certain
added
he
to
be
invited
to
the
balls
at
the
prefecture
and
you
will
of
course
dance
with
madame
pélisson
do
you
know
how
to
dance
show
me
how
you
lespardat
rose
and
clasping
his
chair
in
his
arms
took
one
turn
of
a
waltz
with
the
deportment
of
a
graceful
bear
labarthe
watched
him
very
gravely
through
his
eyeglass
you
are
heavy
awkward
without
that
irresistible
suppleness
which
mirabeau
danced
badly
said
lespardat
after
all
said
labarthe
perhaps
it
is
only
that
the
chair
does
not
inspire
when
they
were
both
once
more
on
the
damp
pavement
of
the
narrow
rue
contrescarpe
they
met
several
girls
who
were
coming
and
going
between
the
carrefour
buci
and
the
of
the
rue
dauphine
as
one
of
these
a
heavy
girl
in
a
dingy
black
dress
was
passing
sadly
by
under
a
street
lamp
with
slack
gait
lespardat
seized
her
roughly
by
the
waist
lifted
her
and
made
her
take
with
him
two
turns
of
a
waltz
across
the
greasy
pavement
and
into
the
gutter
before
she
had
any
idea
what
was
happening
recovering
from
her
astonishment
she
shrieked
the
foulest
insults
at
her
cavalier
who
carried
her
away
with
irresistible
verve
he
himself
supplied
the
orchestra
in
a
baritone
voice
as
warm
and
seductive
as
military
music
and
whirled
so
madly
with
the
girl
that
all
bespattered
with
mud
and
water
from
the
street
they
collided
with
the
shafts
of
prowling
cabs
and
felt
on
their
neck
the
breath
of
the
horses
after
a
few
turns
she
murmured
in
the
young
man
s
ear
her
head
sunk
on
his
breast
and
all
her
anger
gone
after
all
you
are
a
pretty
fellow
you
are
you
ought
to
make
them
happy
didn
t
you
girls
at
bullier
that
s
enough
my
friend
cried
labarthe
don
t
go
and
get
run
in
my
word
you
will
avenge
the
magistracy
in
the
golden
light
of
a
september
day
four
months
later
the
minister
of
justice
and
religion
passing
with
his
secretary
under
the
arcades
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
recognised
lespardat
the
deputy
magistrate
of
nantes
at
the
very
moment
when
the
young
man
was
hurrying
into
the
hôtel
du
louvre
labarthe
asked
the
minister
did
you
know
that
your
protégé
was
in
paris
has
he
then
nothing
to
keep
him
in
nantes
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
now
some
time
since
you
have
given
me
any
confidential
information
about
him
his
start
interested
me
but
i
don
t
know
yet
whether
he
has
quite
lived
up
to
the
high
opinion
you
formed
of
labarthe
took
up
the
cudgels
for
the
he
reminded
the
minister
that
lespardat
was
on
regular
leave
that
at
nantes
he
had
immediately
gained
the
confidence
of
his
chiefs
at
the
bar
and
that
he
had
at
the
same
time
won
the
good
graces
of
the
m
pélisson
added
he
can
not
get
on
without
him
it
is
lespardat
who
organises
the
concerts
at
the
then
the
minister
and
his
secretary
continued
their
walk
towards
the
rue
de
la
paix
along
the
arcades
stopping
here
and
there
before
the
windows
of
the
photograph
shops
there
are
too
many
nude
figures
exposed
in
these
said
the
minister
it
would
be
better
to
take
away
their
license
from
these
shops
strangers
judge
us
by
appearances
and
such
spectacles
as
these
are
calculated
to
injure
the
good
name
of
the
country
and
the
suddenly
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
l
échelle
labarthe
told
his
chief
to
look
at
a
veiled
woman
who
was
coming
towards
them
with
a
rapid
step
but
delarbre
glancing
at
her
for
a
moment
considered
her
very
ordinary
far
too
slender
and
not
at
all
elegant
she
is
clumsily
shod
said
he
she
is
from
the
when
she
had
passed
them
your
excellency
is
quite
right
said
labarthe
that
is
madame
at
this
name
the
minister
much
interested
turned
round
eagerly
with
a
vague
feeling
of
his
own
dignity
he
dared
not
follow
her
but
he
showed
his
curiosity
in
his
look
lebarthe
spurred
it
on
i
ll
wager
monsieur
that
she
won
t
go
very
they
both
hastened
their
steps
and
saw
madame
pélisson
follow
the
arcades
skirt
the
place
du
and
then
throwing
uneasy
glances
to
left
and
right
disappear
into
the
hôtel
du
louvre
at
that
the
minister
began
to
laugh
from
the
depths
of
his
throat
his
little
leaden
eyes
lighted
up
and
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
the
words
which
his
secretary
guessed
rather
than
heard
the
magistracy
is
on
the
same
day
the
emperor
then
in
residence
at
fontainebleau
was
smoking
cigarettes
in
the
library
of
the
palace
he
was
leaning
motionless
with
the
air
of
a
melancholy
against
the
case
in
which
is
kept
the
monaldeschi
coat
of
mail
and
mérimée
both
his
intimate
friends
stood
by
his
side
he
asked
why
monsieur
mérimée
do
you
like
the
works
of
brantôme
sire
replied
mérimée
in
them
i
recognise
the
french
nation
with
her
good
and
bad
qualities
she
is
never
worse
than
when
she
is
without
a
leader
to
show
her
a
noble
really
said
the
emperor
does
one
find
that
in
brantôme
one
also
finds
in
him
answered
mérimée
the
influence
of
women
in
the
affairs
of
at
that
moment
madame
ramel
entered
the
gallery
napoleon
had
given
orders
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
come
to
him
whenever
she
presented
herself
at
the
sight
of
his
he
showed
as
much
delight
as
his
expressionless
sorrowful
face
was
capable
of
displaying
my
dear
madame
ramel
asked
he
how
is
your
nephew
getting
on
at
nantes
is
he
satisfied
but
sire
said
madame
ramel
he
was
not
sent
there
another
was
nominated
in
his
that
s
strange
murmured
his
majesty
thoughtfully
then
placing
his
hand
on
the
academician
s
shoulder
my
dear
monsieur
mérimée
i
am
supposed
to
rule
the
fate
of
france
of
europe
and
of
the
world
and
i
can
not
get
a
nomination
for
a
of
the
sixth
class
at
a
salary
of
two
thousand
four
hundred
xv
having
finished
his
reading
bergeret
folded
up
his
manuscript
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
mazure
paillot
and
de
terremondre
nodded
three
times
in
silence
then
the
placed
a
hand
on
bergeret
s
shoulder
what
you
have
just
read
to
us
my
dear
sir
said
he
is
truly
at
this
moment
léon
flung
himself
into
the
shop
and
exclaimed
with
a
mixture
of
excitement
and
importance
madame
houssieu
has
just
been
found
strangled
in
her
how
extraordinary
said
de
terremondre
from
the
state
of
the
body
added
léon
it
is
believed
that
death
took
place
three
days
then
remarked
mazure
the
archivist
that
would
make
it
saturday
that
the
crime
was
paillot
the
bookseller
who
had
remained
silent
up
till
now
with
his
mouth
wide
open
out
of
deference
to
death
now
began
to
collect
his
thoughts
on
saturday
about
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
i
plainly
heard
stifled
cries
and
the
heavy
thud
produced
by
the
fall
of
a
body
i
even
said
to
these
gentlemen
he
turned
towards
de
terremondre
and
bergeret
that
something
extraordinary
was
going
on
in
queen
marguerite
s
no
one
supported
the
claim
that
the
bookseller
was
making
that
he
alone
by
the
keenness
of
his
senses
and
the
penetration
of
his
mind
had
suspected
the
deed
at
the
moment
when
it
was
taking
place
after
a
respectful
silence
paillot
began
again
during
the
night
between
saturday
and
sunday
i
said
to
madame
paillot
there
isn
t
a
sound
from
queen
marguerite
s
mazure
asked
the
age
of
the
victim
paillot
replied
that
madame
houssieu
was
between
and
eighty
years
of
age
that
she
had
been
a
widow
fifty
years
that
she
owned
landed
property
stocks
and
shares
and
a
large
sum
of
money
but
that
being
miserly
and
eccentric
she
kept
no
servant
and
cooked
her
victuals
herself
over
the
fireplace
in
her
room
living
alone
amidst
a
wreckage
of
furniture
and
crockery
covered
with
the
dust
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
it
was
actually
more
than
years
since
any
one
had
wielded
a
broom
in
queen
marguerite
s
house
madame
houssieu
went
out
but
seldom
bought
a
whole
week
s
supply
of
provisions
for
herself
and
never
let
any
one
into
the
house
save
the
and
two
or
three
urchins
who
ran
errands
for
her
and
the
crime
is
supposed
to
have
been
committed
on
saturday
afternoon
asked
de
terremondre
so
it
is
believed
from
the
state
of
the
body
replied
léon
it
appears
that
it
is
a
ghastly
on
saturday
in
the
afternoon
replied
de
terremondre
we
were
here
merely
separated
by
a
wall
from
the
horrible
scene
and
we
were
chatting
about
passing
there
was
again
a
long
silence
then
some
one
asked
if
the
assassin
had
been
arrested
or
if
they
even
knew
who
it
was
but
in
spite
of
his
zeal
léon
could
not
answer
these
questions
a
shadow
which
grew
ever
deeper
and
deeper
and
seemed
funereal
began
to
fall
across
the
bookseller
s
shop
it
was
caused
by
the
dark
crowd
of
sightseers
swarming
in
the
square
in
front
of
the
house
of
crime
doubtless
they
are
waiting
for
the
inspector
of
police
and
the
public
prosecutor
said
mazure
the
archivist
paillot
who
was
gifted
with
an
exquisite
caution
fearing
lest
the
eager
people
would
break
the
ordered
léon
to
close
the
shutters
don
t
leave
anything
open
said
he
save
the
window
which
looks
on
the
rue
des
this
precautionary
measure
seemed
to
bear
the
stamp
of
a
certain
moral
delicacy
the
gentlemen
of
the
corner
approved
of
it
but
since
the
rue
des
tintelleries
was
narrow
and
since
on
that
side
the
panes
were
covered
with
notices
and
the
shop
became
plunged
in
darkness
the
murmur
of
the
crowd
till
then
unnoticed
spread
with
the
shadow
and
became
continuous
hollow
solemn
almost
terrible
evidencing
the
unanimity
of
the
moral
condemnation
much
moved
de
terremondre
gave
fresh
expression
to
the
thought
which
had
struck
him
it
is
strange
said
he
that
while
the
crime
was
being
committed
so
near
us
we
were
talking
quietly
of
unimportant
at
this
bergeret
bent
his
head
towards
his
left
shoulder
gave
a
glance
and
spoke
thus
my
dear
sir
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
there
is
nothing
strange
in
that
it
is
not
customary
when
a
criminal
action
is
going
on
that
conversations
should
stop
of
their
own
accord
around
the
victim
either
within
a
radius
of
so
many
leagues
or
even
of
so
many
feet
a
commotion
inspired
by
the
most
villainous
thought
only
produces
natural
de
terremondre
made
no
reply
to
this
speech
and
the
rest
of
his
hearers
turned
away
from
bergeret
with
a
vague
sense
of
disquietude
and
disapproval
still
the
professor
of
literature
persisted
and
why
should
an
act
so
natural
and
so
common
as
murder
produce
strange
and
uncommon
results
to
kill
is
common
to
animals
and
especially
to
man
murder
was
for
long
ages
regarded
in
human
civilisation
as
a
courageous
action
and
there
still
remain
in
our
morals
and
institutions
certain
traces
of
this
ancient
point
of
what
traces
demanded
de
terremondre
they
are
to
be
found
in
the
honours
replied
bergeret
which
are
paid
to
that
is
not
the
same
thing
said
de
terremondre
certainly
it
is
said
bergeret
for
the
motive
force
of
all
human
actions
is
hunger
or
love
hunger
taught
savages
murder
impelled
them
to
wars
to
invasions
civilised
nations
are
like
a
perverted
instinct
drives
them
to
destroy
without
profit
or
reason
the
unreasonableness
of
modern
wars
disguises
itself
under
dynastic
interest
nationality
balance
of
power
honour
this
last
pretext
is
perhaps
the
most
extravagant
of
all
for
there
is
not
a
nation
in
the
world
that
is
not
sullied
with
every
crime
and
loaded
with
every
shame
there
is
not
one
of
them
which
has
not
endured
all
the
humiliations
that
fortune
could
inflict
on
a
miserable
band
of
men
if
there
yet
remains
any
honour
among
the
nations
it
is
a
strange
means
of
upholding
it
to
make
is
to
say
to
commit
all
the
crimes
by
which
an
individual
dishonours
himself
arson
robbery
rape
murder
and
as
for
the
actions
whose
motive
power
is
love
they
are
for
the
most
part
as
violent
as
frenzied
as
cruel
as
the
actions
inspired
by
hunger
so
much
so
that
one
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
man
is
a
mischievous
beast
but
it
still
remains
to
inquire
why
i
know
this
and
whence
it
comes
that
the
fact
arouses
grief
and
indignation
in
me
if
nothing
but
evil
existed
it
would
not
be
visible
as
the
night
would
have
no
name
if
the
sun
never
de
terremondre
however
had
extended
enough
deference
to
the
religion
of
tenderness
and
human
dignity
by
reproaching
himself
with
having
conversed
in
a
gay
and
careless
fashion
at
the
moment
of
the
crime
and
so
near
the
victim
he
began
to
regard
the
tragic
end
of
madame
houssieu
as
a
familiar
incident
which
one
might
look
at
straightforwardly
and
of
which
one
might
deduce
the
consequences
he
reflected
that
now
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
his
buying
queen
marguerite
s
house
as
a
storehouse
for
his
collections
of
furniture
china
and
tapestry
and
thus
starting
a
sort
of
municipal
museum
as
a
reward
for
his
zeal
and
munificence
he
counted
on
receiving
along
with
the
applause
of
his
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
perhaps
the
title
of
correspondent
of
the
institute
he
had
in
the
academy
of
inscriptions
two
or
three
comrades
old
bachelors
like
himself
with
whom
he
sometimes
lunched
in
paris
in
some
and
to
whom
he
recounted
many
anecdotes
about
women
and
there
was
no
correspondent
for
the
district
hence
he
had
already
reached
the
point
of
depreciating
the
coveted
house
it
won
t
stand
upright
much
longer
said
he
that
house
of
queen
marguerite
the
beams
of
the
floors
used
to
fall
in
flakes
of
touchwood
on
the
poor
old
octogenarian
it
will
be
necessary
to
spend
an
immense
sum
in
putting
it
in
the
best
thing
said
mazure
the
archivist
would
be
to
pull
it
down
and
remove
the
frontage
to
the
courtyard
of
the
museum
it
would
really
be
a
pity
to
abandon
philippe
tricouillard
s
shield
to
the
they
heard
a
great
commotion
among
the
crowd
in
the
square
it
was
the
noise
of
the
people
whom
the
police
were
driving
back
to
clear
a
passage
for
the
magistrates
into
the
house
of
crime
paillot
pushed
his
nose
out
of
the
door
here
said
he
comes
the
examining
judge
roquincourt
with
surcouf
his
clerk
they
have
gone
into
the
one
after
the
other
the
academicians
of
the
corner
had
slipped
out
behind
the
bookseller
on
to
the
pavement
of
the
rue
des
tintelleries
from
which
they
watched
the
surging
movements
of
the
people
who
crowded
the
place
among
the
mob
paillot
recognised
cassignol
the
president
in
chief
the
old
man
was
taking
his
daily
constitutional
the
excited
crowd
in
which
he
had
got
entangled
during
his
walk
impeded
his
short
steps
and
feeble
sight
he
went
on
still
upright
and
sturdy
carrying
his
withered
white
head
erect
when
paillot
saw
him
he
ran
up
to
him
doffed
his
velvet
cap
and
offering
him
his
arm
invited
him
to
come
and
sit
down
in
the
shop
how
imprudent
of
you
monsieur
cassignol
to
venture
into
such
a
crowd
it
s
almost
like
a
at
the
word
riot
the
old
man
had
a
vision
as
it
were
of
the
century
of
revolution
three
parts
of
which
he
had
seen
he
was
now
in
his
year
and
had
already
been
on
the
retired
list
for
years
leaning
on
the
bookseller
paillot
he
crossed
the
doorstep
of
the
shop
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
in
the
midst
of
the
respectful
academicians
his
malacca
cane
with
its
silver
top
trembled
under
his
hand
between
his
hollow
thighs
his
spine
was
stiffer
than
the
back
of
his
chair
he
drew
off
his
tortoiseshell
spectacles
to
wipe
them
and
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
put
them
on
again
he
had
lost
his
memory
for
faces
and
although
he
was
hard
of
hearing
it
was
by
the
voice
that
he
recognised
people
he
asked
concisely
for
the
cause
of
the
crowds
which
had
gathered
in
the
square
but
he
hardly
listened
to
the
answer
given
him
by
de
terremondre
his
brain
sound
but
ossified
steeped
as
it
were
in
myrrh
received
no
new
impressions
although
old
ideas
and
passions
remained
deeply
embedded
in
it
mm
de
terremondre
mazure
and
bergeret
stood
up
in
a
circle
round
him
they
were
ignorant
of
his
story
lost
now
in
the
immemorial
past
they
only
knew
that
he
had
been
the
disciple
the
friend
and
the
companion
of
lacordaire
and
montalembert
that
he
had
opposed
as
far
as
the
precise
limits
of
his
rights
and
his
office
permitted
the
establishment
of
the
empire
that
in
former
days
he
had
been
subjected
to
the
insults
of
louis
veuillot
l
and
that
he
went
every
sunday
to
mass
with
a
great
book
under
his
arm
like
all
the
town
they
recognised
that
he
retained
his
honesty
and
the
glory
of
having
maintained
the
cause
of
liberty
throughout
his
whole
life
but
not
one
of
them
could
have
told
of
what
type
was
his
liberalism
for
none
of
them
had
read
this
sentence
in
a
pamphlet
published
by
cassignol
in
on
the
affairs
of
rome
there
is
no
liberty
save
that
of
the
man
who
believes
in
jesus
christ
and
in
the
moral
dignity
of
it
was
said
that
still
remaining
active
in
mind
at
his
age
he
was
classifying
his
correspondence
and
working
at
a
book
on
the
relations
between
church
and
state
he
still
spoke
fluently
and
brightly
l
louis
veuillot
author
and
journalist
born
and
much
given
to
duels
both
with
words
and
swords
during
the
conversation
which
he
followed
with
difficulty
on
hearing
a
mention
of
the
name
of
garrand
the
public
prosecutor
of
the
republic
he
remarked
looking
down
at
the
knob
of
his
stick
as
though
it
were
the
solitary
witness
of
those
bygone
days
that
still
survived
in
i
knew
at
lyons
a
public
prosecutor
for
the
crown
who
had
a
high
idea
of
his
duties
he
used
to
maintain
that
one
of
the
attributes
of
public
administration
was
infallibility
and
that
the
king
s
prosecutor
could
no
more
be
in
the
wrong
than
the
king
himself
his
name
was
de
clavel
and
he
left
some
valuable
works
on
criminal
then
the
old
man
was
silent
alone
with
his
memories
in
the
midst
of
men
paillot
on
the
doorstep
was
watching
what
was
going
on
outside
here
is
roquincourt
coming
out
of
the
cassignol
thinking
only
of
past
events
said
i
started
at
the
bar
i
was
under
the
orders
of
de
clavel
who
used
again
and
again
to
repeat
to
me
grasp
this
maxim
thoroughly
the
interests
of
the
prisoner
are
sacred
the
interests
of
society
are
doubly
sacred
the
interests
of
justice
are
thrice
metaphysical
principles
had
in
those
days
more
influence
on
men
s
minds
than
they
have
that
s
very
true
said
de
terremondre
they
are
carrying
away
a
some
linen
and
a
little
truck
said
paillot
these
are
doubtless
articles
to
be
used
in
de
terremondre
no
longer
able
to
restrain
himself
went
forward
to
watch
the
loading
of
the
truck
suddenly
knitting
his
brows
he
exclaimed
sacrebleu
then
seeing
paillot
s
inquiring
look
he
added
it
s
nothing
nothing
cunning
collector
that
he
was
he
had
just
caught
sight
of
a
in
à
la
among
the
articles
attached
and
he
was
making
up
his
mind
to
inquire
about
it
after
the
trial
from
surcouf
the
registrar
who
was
an
obliging
man
in
getting
together
his
collections
he
used
artifice
one
must
rise
to
the
occasion
he
used
to
say
to
himself
times
are
i
was
nominated
deputy
at
years
of
age
resumed
cassignol
at
that
time
my
long
curly
hair
my
beardless
ruddy
cheeks
gave
me
a
look
of
youth
that
rendered
me
desperate
in
order
to
inspire
respect
i
had
to
affect
an
air
of
solemnity
and
to
wear
an
aspect
of
severity
i
carried
out
my
duties
with
a
diligence
that
brought
its
reward
at
years
of
age
i
became
at
it
is
a
picturesque
town
said
mazure
in
the
performance
of
my
new
duties
i
had
to
inquire
into
an
affair
of
little
interest
if
one
only
took
account
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
the
character
of
the
accused
but
which
had
indeed
its
own
importance
since
it
was
a
matter
that
involved
the
death
sentence
a
fairly
prosperous
farmer
had
been
found
murdered
in
his
bed
i
pass
over
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
which
yet
remain
fixed
in
my
memory
although
they
were
as
commonplace
as
possible
i
need
only
say
that
from
the
opening
of
the
inquiry
suspicions
fell
on
a
ploughman
a
servant
of
the
victim
this
was
a
man
of
thirty
his
name
was
poudrailles
hyacinthe
poudrailles
on
the
day
following
the
crime
he
had
suddenly
disappeared
and
was
found
in
a
where
he
was
spending
pretty
freely
strong
circumstantial
evidence
pointed
to
him
as
the
author
of
this
murder
a
sum
of
sixty
francs
was
found
on
him
for
the
possession
of
which
he
could
not
account
his
clothes
bore
traces
of
blood
two
witnesses
had
seen
him
prowling
round
the
farm
on
the
night
of
the
crime
it
is
true
that
another
witness
swore
to
an
alibi
but
that
witness
was
a
bad
character
the
examination
had
been
very
well
managed
by
a
judge
of
consummate
ability
the
case
for
the
prosecution
was
drawn
up
with
much
skill
but
poudrailles
had
made
no
confession
and
in
court
during
the
whole
course
of
the
he
fenced
himself
about
with
a
series
of
denials
from
which
nothing
could
dislodge
him
i
had
prepared
my
address
as
public
prosecutor
with
all
the
care
of
which
i
was
capable
and
with
all
the
conscientiousness
of
a
young
man
who
does
not
wish
to
appear
unfitted
for
his
high
duties
i
brought
to
the
delivery
of
it
all
the
ardour
of
my
youth
the
alibi
furnished
by
the
woman
cortot
who
pretended
that
she
had
kept
poudrailles
in
her
house
at
puy
during
the
night
of
the
crime
was
a
great
obstacle
to
me
i
set
myself
to
break
it
down
i
threatened
the
woman
cortot
with
the
penalties
attaching
to
perjury
one
of
my
arguments
made
a
special
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
jury
i
reminded
them
that
according
to
the
report
of
the
neighbours
the
had
not
barked
at
the
murderer
that
was
because
they
knew
him
it
was
then
no
stranger
it
was
the
ploughman
it
was
poudrailles
finally
i
called
for
the
death
penalty
and
i
got
it
poudrailles
was
condemned
to
death
by
a
majority
of
votes
after
the
reading
of
the
sentence
he
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
i
am
innocent
at
this
a
terrible
doubt
seized
me
i
felt
that
after
all
he
might
be
speaking
the
truth
and
that
i
did
not
myself
possess
that
certainty
with
which
i
had
inspired
the
minds
of
the
jury
my
colleagues
my
chiefs
my
seniors
and
even
the
counsel
for
the
defence
came
to
congratulate
me
on
this
brilliant
success
to
applaud
my
youthful
and
formidable
eloquence
these
praises
were
sweet
to
me
you
know
gentlemen
vauvenargues
dainty
fancy
about
the
first
rays
of
glory
yet
the
voice
of
poudrailles
saying
i
am
innocent
thundered
in
my
ears
my
doubts
still
remained
with
me
and
i
was
forced
again
and
again
to
go
over
my
speech
for
the
prosecution
in
my
mind
poudrailles
appeal
was
dismissed
and
my
uncertainty
increased
at
that
time
it
was
comparatively
seldom
that
reprieves
arrested
the
carrying
out
of
the
death
sentence
poudrailles
petitioned
in
vain
for
a
commutation
of
the
sentence
on
the
morning
of
the
day
fixed
for
the
execution
when
the
scaffold
had
already
been
erected
at
martouret
i
went
to
the
prison
got
them
to
open
the
condemned
cell
to
me
and
alone
face
to
face
with
the
prisoner
said
to
him
nothing
can
alter
your
fate
if
there
remains
in
you
one
good
feeling
in
the
interests
of
your
own
soul
and
to
set
my
mind
at
rest
poudrailles
tell
me
whether
you
are
guilty
of
the
crime
for
which
you
are
he
looked
at
me
for
some
moments
without
replying
i
still
see
his
dull
face
and
wide
dumb
mouth
i
had
a
moment
of
terrible
anguish
at
last
he
bent
his
head
right
down
and
murmured
in
a
feeble
but
distinct
voice
now
that
i
have
no
hope
left
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
i
did
it
and
i
had
more
trouble
than
you
would
believe
because
the
old
man
was
strong
all
the
same
he
was
a
bad
when
i
heard
this
final
confession
i
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
cassignol
stopped
gazed
fixedly
for
a
long
time
at
the
knob
of
his
stick
with
his
faded
eyes
and
then
uttered
these
words
during
my
long
career
as
a
magistrate
i
have
never
known
of
a
single
judicial
that
s
a
reassuring
statement
said
de
terremondre
it
makes
my
blood
run
cold
with
horror
murmured
bergeret
xvi
that
year
as
usual
the
went
shooting
at
valcombe
at
the
house
of
delion
an
and
a
member
of
the
general
council
who
had
the
finest
shooting
in
the
district
the
enjoyed
himself
very
much
at
valcombe
he
was
flattered
at
meeting
there
many
people
of
good
family
especially
the
gromances
and
the
terremondres
and
he
took
a
deep
joy
in
winging
pheasants
here
he
was
to
be
seen
pacing
the
woodland
paths
in
exuberant
spirits
he
shot
with
twisted
body
with
raised
shoulders
and
bent
head
with
one
eye
closed
and
brows
knitted
in
the
style
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
bookmakers
and
his
original
shooting
companions
he
proclaimed
noisily
with
tactless
delight
the
birds
that
he
had
brought
down
and
by
now
and
then
attributing
to
himself
those
that
had
fallen
to
his
neighbours
guns
he
aroused
an
indignation
which
he
immediately
allayed
by
the
placidity
of
his
temper
and
by
entire
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
any
one
could
possibly
be
vexed
with
him
in
all
his
behaviour
he
united
pleasantly
enough
the
importance
of
an
official
with
the
familiarity
of
a
cheerful
guest
he
flung
their
titles
at
men
as
though
they
were
nicknames
and
because
like
all
the
department
he
knew
that
de
gromance
was
an
husband
at
every
meeting
he
would
give
this
man
of
ceremony
several
affectionate
little
taps
without
any
apparent
reason
among
the
company
at
valcombe
he
imagined
himself
to
be
popular
and
he
was
not
entirely
wrong
when
despite
his
underbred
manners
and
toadying
air
his
companions
had
got
off
of
both
shot
and
impertinences
he
was
considered
dexterous
and
they
said
that
at
bottom
he
had
tact
this
year
he
had
succeeded
better
than
ever
in
the
capitalist
circle
it
was
known
that
he
was
opposed
to
the
income
tax
which
in
private
conversation
he
had
felicitously
described
as
inquisitorial
at
valcombe
therefore
he
was
the
recipient
of
the
congratulations
of
a
grateful
society
and
madame
delion
smiled
on
him
softening
for
him
her
eyes
and
her
majestic
forehead
crowned
with
bandeaux
of
on
leaving
his
room
where
he
had
been
dressing
for
dinner
he
saw
the
lissom
figure
of
madame
de
gromance
gliding
along
the
dark
corridor
with
a
rustle
of
clothes
and
jewels
in
the
dusk
her
bare
shoulders
seemed
barer
than
ever
he
frisked
forward
to
overtake
her
seized
her
by
the
waist
and
kissed
her
on
the
neck
when
she
freed
herself
hurriedly
he
said
to
her
in
reproachful
accents
why
so
cruel
to
countess
then
she
gave
him
a
box
on
the
ears
which
surprised
him
greatly
on
the
landing
he
came
upon
noémi
who
very
seemly
in
her
dress
of
black
satin
covered
with
black
tulle
was
slowly
drawing
her
long
gloves
over
her
arms
he
made
a
friendly
little
sign
to
her
with
his
eye
he
was
a
good
husband
and
regarded
his
wife
with
a
good
deal
of
esteem
and
some
admiration
she
deserved
it
for
she
had
need
of
rare
tact
not
to
ruffle
the
society
of
valcombe
and
she
was
not
unpopular
there
she
had
even
won
their
sympathy
and
what
was
most
astonishing
she
did
not
seem
an
outsider
in
that
great
cold
provincial
salon
she
assumed
an
face
and
a
placid
demeanour
which
produced
a
doubt
of
her
intelligence
but
proclaimed
her
honest
sweet
and
good
with
madame
delion
and
the
other
women
she
admired
approved
and
held
her
tongue
and
if
a
man
of
some
intelligence
and
experience
entered
into
a
with
her
she
made
herself
still
more
demure
modest
and
timid
with
downcast
eyes
then
suddenly
she
hurled
some
broad
jest
at
him
which
tickled
him
by
its
unexpectedness
and
which
he
regarded
as
a
special
favour
coming
from
so
prim
a
mouth
and
so
reserved
a
mind
she
captivated
the
hearts
of
the
old
sparks
without
a
gesture
without
a
movement
without
the
flutter
of
a
fan
with
an
imperceptible
quiver
of
her
eyelashes
and
a
swift
pursing
of
the
lips
she
insinuated
ideas
that
flattered
them
she
made
a
conquest
of
mauricet
himself
who
great
connoisseur
as
he
was
said
of
her

has
always
been
plain
she
is
no
longer
even
attractive
but

at

between
madame

and
madame
wife
of
the
senator
of
madame
was
a
sallow
little
woman
whom
one
always
seemed
to
be
looking
at
through
gauze
so
soft
were
her
features
as
a
young
girl
she
had
been
steeped
in
religion
as
if
it
had
been
oil
now
the
wife
of
a
clever
man
who
had
married
her
for
her
fortune
she
wallowed
in
unctuous
piety
while
her
husband
devoted
his
energies
to
the
and
secular
parties
she
gave
herself
up
to
endless
petty
tasks
and
deeply
attached
as
she
was
to
her
wedded
condition
when
a
demand
was
lodged
before
the
senate
for
the
authorisation
of
judicial
proceedings
against
and
several
other
senators
she
offered
two
candles
in
the
church
of
before
the
painted
statue
of
saint
anthony
in
order
that
by
his
good
offices
her
husband
s
opponents
might
be

it
was
in
that
way
that
the
affair
ended
a
pupil
of
gambetta
had
in
his
possession
certain
small
documents
a
photographic
reproduction
of
which
he
had
sent
at
a
timely
moment
to
the
keeper
of
the
seals
madame
in
the
zeal
of
her
gratitude
had
a
marble
slab
put
up
as
a
on
the
wall
of
the
chapel
with
this
inscription
drawn
up
by
the
venerable
laprune
himself
saint
anthony
from
a
christian
wife
in
gratitude
for
an
unexpected
since
then
had
retrieved
his
position
he
had
given
serious
pledges
to
the
conservatives
who
hoped
to
utilise
his
great
financial
talents
in
the
struggle
against
socialism
his
political
position
had
become
satisfactory
again
provided
he
affronted
no
one
and
did
not
seize
the
reins
of
power
for
himself
and
with
her
waxen
fingers
madame
embroidered
well
madame
said
the
to
her
after
the
soup
are
your
good
works
prospering
do
you
know
that
after
madame
cartier
de
chalmot
you
are
the
lady
in
the
department
who
presides
over
the
largest
number
of
charities
she
made
no
answer
he
recollected
that
she
was
deaf
and
turning
towards
madame
delion
tell
me
i
beg
you
madame
about
saint
anthony
s
charity
it
was
this
poor
madame
who
made
me
think
of
it
my
wife
tells
me
it
is
a
new
cult
that
is
becoming
the
rage
in
the
madame
is
right
my
dear
sir
we
are
all
devoted
to
saint
then
they
heard
mauricet
in
reply
to
a
sentence
lost
in
the
noise
say
to
delion
you
flatter
me
my
dear
sir
the
very
much
neglected
since
louis
s
time
is
not
to
be
compared
with
valcombe
for
its
sport
there
is
very
little
game
there
still
a
poacher
of
rare
skill
named
rivoire
who
honours
the
with
his
nocturnal
visits
kills
plenty
of
pheasants
there
and
you
ve
no
idea
what
an
extraordinary
old
blunderbuss
he
shoots
them
with
it
s
a
specimen
for
a
museum
i
owe
him
thanks
for
having
one
day
allowed
me
to
examine
it
at
leisure
imagine
a
i
am
told
madame
said
the
that
the
worshippers
address
their
requests
to
saint
anthony
in
a
sealed
paper
and
that
they
make
no
payment
until
after
the
blessing
demanded
has
been
don
t
jest
replied
madame
delion
saint
anthony
grants
many
it
is
continued
mauricet
the
barrel
of
an
old
musket
which
has
been
cut
through
and
mounted
on
a
kind
of
hinge
so
that
it
rocks
up
and
down
and
i
thought
replied
the
that
saint
anthony
s
speciality
was
finding
lost
that
is
why
answered
madame
delion
so
many
requests
are
made
to
and
she
added
with
a
sigh
who
in
this
world
has
not
lost
a
precious
possession
peace
of
heart
a
conscience
at
rest
a
friendship
formed
in
childhood
or
a
husband
s
love
it
is
then
that
one
prays
to
saint
or
to
his
comrade
added
the
whom
the
ironmaster
s
wines
had
elated
and
who
in
his
innocence
was
confusing
saint
anthony
of
padua
with
saint
anthony
the
hermit
but
asked
de
terremondre
this
rivoire
is
known
as
the
poacher
to
the
prefecture
is
he
not
you
are
mistaken
monsieur
de
terremondre
replied
the
he
has
a
still
more
honourable
appointment
as
poacher
to
the
archbishopric
he
supplies
monseigneur
s
he
also
consents
to
put
his
skill
at
the
service
of
the
court
said
president
peloux
delion
and
madame
cartier
de
chalmot
were
conversing
together
in
low
tones
my
son
gustave
dear
lady
is
going
to
serve
his
military
term
this
year
i
should
so
much
like
him
to
be
placed
under
general
cartier
de
do
not
set
your
heart
on
that
monsieur
my
husband
hates
favouritism
and
he
is
chary
of
granting
leave
he
expects
lads
of
good
family
to
show
an
example
of
work
and
he
has
imbued
all
his
colonels
with
his
and
the
barrel
of
this
musket
continued
mauricet
corresponds
with
no
recognised
bore
so
that
rivoire
can
only
make
use
of
undersized
cartridges
you
can
easily
imagine
the
was
unfolding
certain
arguments
calculated
to
bring
madame
delion
completely
over
to
the
government
and
he
concluded
with
this
noble
thought
at
the
moment
when
the
czar
is
coming
on
a
visit
to
france
it
is
necessary
that
the
republic
should
identify
itself
with
the
upper
classes
of
the
nation
in
order
to
put
them
in
touch
with
our
great
ally
meanwhile
with
the
calm
of
a
madonna
noémi
was
kissing
feet
with
peloux
who
had
been
feeling
about
for
hers
under
the
table
young
gustave
delion
was
saying
in
a
low
voice
to
madame
de
gromance
i
hope
that
this
time
you
will
not
keep
me
hanging
about
as
you
did
on
the
day
when
you
were
playing
the
fool
with
that
dotard
of
a
mauricet
whilst
i
had
no
other
amusement
in
your
yellow
than
to
potter
with
the
works
of
the
what
an
excellent
woman
madame
is
exclaimed
madame
delion
in
a
sudden
outburst
of
affection
excellent
said
the
swallowing
a
quarter
of
a
pear
it
is
a
pity
that
she
is
as
deaf
as
a
post
her
husband
also
is
an
excellent
man
and
very
intelligent
i
am
glad
to
see
that
people
are
beginning
to
readjust
their
views
of
him
he
has
gone
through
a
difficult
time
the
enemies
of
the
republic
wanted
to
compromise
him
in
order
to
discredit
the
government
he
has
been
the
victim
of
schemes
that
aimed
at
excluding
from
parliament
the
leading
men
belonging
to
the
business
world
such
an
exclusion
would
lower
the
level
of
national
representation
and
would
be
in
all
respects
for
a
moment
he
remained
thoughtful
then
he
said
sadly
besides
no
further
scandals
can
be
hatched
no
more
charges
are
being
trumped
up
and
there
we
have
one
of
the
most
grievous
results
of
this
campaign
of
calumny
carried
on
with
perhaps
it
is
as
well
sighed
madame
delion
thoughtfully
and
meaningly
then
suddenly
with
a
burst
of
fervour
monsieur
give
us
back
our
dear
religious
orders
let
our
sisters
of
charity
return
to
the
hospitals
and
our
god
to
the
schools
whence
you
have
expelled
him
no
longer
prevent
our
rearing
our
sons
as
christians
and
we
shall
be
very
near
to
a
mutual
hearing
these
words
flung
up
his
hands
as
well
as
his
knife
on
which
was
a
morsel
of
cheese
and
exclaimed
with
heartfelt
sincerity
good
god
madame
don
t
you
see
that
the
streets
of
the
county
town
are
black
with
curés
and
that
there
are
monks
behind
all
the
gratings

for
your
young
gustave

it

who
prevent
him
from
going
to
mass
all

instead
of
running
after
the
girls

was
finishing
his
description
of
the
marvellous
blunderbuss
amid
the
clatter
of
voices

echo
of
laughter

the
little
tinkling

was

there
by

held
out
a
cigar

are

in
reply
to
peloux

thanks
showing
the
box
of

he
answered

of

stock

of
the
guests

with
greater
gallantry
had
been
chatting
for
a
few
minutes
with
the
ladies

was
listening
approvingly
to

was
explaining
to
him
how
necessary
it
was
in
shooting
to
calculate
distances
accurately

of

him

refused
to

he
had
not

which
evaded

at
length
by
a
sudden
recoil
come
of
its
own
accord
for
the
last
two
years
the
whole
society
of
the
district
had
looked
upon
president
peloux
as
an
upright
magistrate
they
admired
his
courage
when
smiling
placidly
between
his
two
pale
assessors
he
had
condemned
to
five
years
imprisonment
three
confederate
anarchists
guilty
of
having
distributed
in
the
barracks
bills
exhorting
the
nations
to
fraternise
announced
peloux
having
practised
for
a
long
time
in
the
sleepy
restaurant
of
a
county
town
in
a
rural
canton
he
had
learnt
a
close
professional
game
he
raked
his
balls
into
a
little
corner
of
the
and
brought
off
a
series
of
cannons
played
in
the
broad
splendid
reckless
style
of
the
of
montmartre
and
clichy
and
laying
the
failure
of
his
rash
strokes

the
charge

hardness
of

de

in
my
cousin
jacques
house
there
is
a
with
pockets
which
dates
from
louis

time
in
a
very
low
vaulted
hall
of
soft
whitewashed
stone
where
this
inscription
is
still
to
be
read
gentlemen
are

not
to

request
to
which
no

attention

pitted
with
a
number
of
little
round
holes
whose
origin
is
accurately
explained
by
this
peloux
was
asked
in
several
directions
at
once
for
details
as
to
the
affair
in
queen
marguerite
s
house
the
murder
of
madame
houssieu
which
had
excited
all
the
district
was
still
arousing
interest
every
one
knew
that
a
crushing
weight
of
evidence
hung
over
a
butcher
s
boy
of
nineteen
named
lecœur
whom
folks
used
to
see
twice
a
week
entering
the
old
lady
s
house
with
his
basket
on
his
head
it
was
also
known
that
the
prosecution
was
detaining
two
upholsterers
apprentices
of
fourteen
and
sixteen
years
of
age
as
accomplices
and
it
was
said
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
in
circumstances
which
made
the
story
of
it
a
particularly
delicate
one
being
questioned
on
this
point
peloux
lifted
his
round
ruddy
head
from
the
and
winked
the
case
is
being
tried
the
scene
of
the
murder
has
been
reconstructed
in
its
entirety
i
don
t
believe
that
there
is
a
doubt
left
as
to
the
acts
of
debauchery
which
preceded
the
crime
and
facilitated
the
perpetration
of
he
took
up
his
liqueur
glass
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
armagnac
smacked
his
lips
and
said
heavens
what
velvet
and
when
a
circle
of
inquirers
crowded
round
him
asking
for
details
the
magistrate
in
a
low
voice
disclosed
certain
circumstances
which
provoked
murmurs
of
surprise
and
grunts
of
disgust
is
it
possible
was
the
comment
a
woman
of
eighty
the
case
answered
peloux
is
not
unique
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
after
my
experience
as
a
magistrate
and
the
young
scamps
of
the
faubourgs
know
much
more
on
this
subject
than
we
do
the
crime
in
queen
marguerite
s
house
is
of
a
classified
sort
i
might
call
it
a
classic
type
i
immediately
scented
it
out
as
senile
debauchery
and
i
saw
quite
clearly
that
roquincourt
the
prosecuting
counsel
was
following
a
wrong
track
he
had
naturally
ordered
the
arrest
of
all
the
vagabonds
and
tramps
found
wandering
within
a
wide
circumference
every
one
of
them
aroused
suspicions
and
what
put
the
crowning
touch
to
his
mistake
was
that
one
of
them
sieurin
nicknamed
alouette
a
regular
old
made
a
how
was
that
he
was
bored
with
solitary
confinement
he
had
been
promised
a
pipe
of
canteen
tobacco
if
he
confessed
he
did
confess
he
told
them
all
they
wanted
this
sieurin
who
has
been
sentenced
times
for
vagabondage
is
incapable
of
killing
a
fly
he
has
never
committed
robbery
he
is
a
simpleton
an
inoffensive
creature
at
the
time
of
the
crime
the
gendarmes
saw
him
on
duroc
hill
making
straw
fountains
and
cork
boats
for
the
school
resumed
his
game
during
this
time
lecœur
was
telling
all
the
girls
in
the
quartier
des
carreaux
that
he
had
done
the
deed
and
the
keepers
of
disorderly
houses
were
bringing
to
the
madame
houssieu
s
earrings
chain
and
rings
that
the
had
distributed
among
their
inmates
this
lecœur
like
so
many
other
murderers
gave
himself
up
but
roquincourt
in
a
rage
left
sieurin
or
alouette
in
solitary
confinement
he
is
still
there
and
one
splendid
said
so
murmured
delion
this
woman
of
had
still
it
is
incredible
but
fornerol
agreeing
with
president
peloux
s
opinion
declared
that
the
case
was
not
as
unusual
as
they
fancied
and
he
supplied
the
physiological
explanation
which
was
listened
to
with
interest
then
he
went
on
to
quote
different
cases
of
sexual
aberrations
and
wound
up
in
these
words
if
the
devil
on
two
sticks
lifting
us
up
in
the
air
were
to
raise
the
roofs
of
the
town
before
our
eyes
we
should
see
appalling
sights
and
we
should
be
staggered
at
the
discovery
among
our
of
so
many
maniacs
degenerates
mad
men
and
mad
bah
said
the
one
must
not
look
too
closely
into
that
all
these
people
taken
one
by
one
are
perhaps
what
you
say
but
together
they
form
a
superb
mass
of
constituents
and
a
splendid
population
for
the
now
on
the
raised
divan
which
overlooked
the
senator
sat
caressing
his
long
white
beard
he
had
the
majesty
of
a
river
for
my
part
said
he
i
can
only
believe
in
goodness
wherever
i
cast
my
eyes
i
see
virtue
and
honesty
i
have
been
able
to
prove
by
numerous
instances
that
the
morals
of
the
french
women
since
the
revolution
leave
nothing
to
be
desired
especially
in
the
middle
i
am
not
so
optimistic
replied
de
terremondre
but
i
certainly
did
not
suspect
that
queen
marguerite
s
house
hid
such
shameful
mysteries
behind
its
walls
of
crumbling
woodwork
and
beneath
the
of
its
mullioned
windows
i
went
to
see
madame
houssieu
several
times
she
seemed
to
me
a
miserly
and
mistrustful
old
woman
a
little
mad
yet
like
so
many
others
but
as
they
used
to
say
in
the
time
of
queen
marguerite
she
is
under
the
sod
her
soul
be
with
god
m
she
will
no
longer
by
her
lewdness
blot
the
scutcheon
of
good
philippe
m
elle
est
sous
lame
dieu
ait
son
âme
at
that
name
a
shout
of
merry
laughter
burst
from
their
knowing
faces
it
was
the
secret
joy
and
inward
pride
of
the
town
that
emblematic
shield
with
its
witness
to
the
triple
virtue
and
power
that
put
this
bourgeois
ancestor
of
theirs
on
a
level
with
the
great
condottiere
of
bergamo
the
people
of
loved
him
their
lusty
forebear
the
contemporary
of
the
king
in
the
nouvelles
their
ancient
alderman
philippe
tricouillard
about
whom
to
tell
the
truth
they
knew
nothing
save
the
gift
of
nature
to
which
he
owed
his
illustrious
surname
the
turn
taken
by
the
conversation
led
fornerol
to
say
that
several
instances
had
been
cited
of
a
similar
anomaly
and
that
certain
writers
declare
that
at
times
this
honourable
monstrosity
is
transmitted
hereditarily
and
becomes
persistent
in
a
family
unluckily
the
line
of
the
worthy
philippe
had
been
extinct
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
after
this
remark
de
terremondre
who
was
president
of
the
archæological
society
related
a
true
anecdote
our
departmental
archivist
said
he
the
learned
mazure
has
recently
discovered
in
the
garrets
of
the
prefecture
some
documents
relating
to
a
charge
of
adultery
brought
at
the
very
period
when
philippe
tricouillard
was
flourishing
towards
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
by
jehan
tabouret
against
sidoine
cloche
his
wife
for
the
reason
that
the
aforesaid
sidoine
having
had
three
children
at
a
birth
sieur
jehan
tabouret
only
acknowledged
two
of
them
as
his
and
maintained
that
the
third
was
by
another
man
for
he
averred
that
he
was
constitutionally
incapable
of
begetting
more
than
two
at
a
time
and
he
gave
a
reason
for
this
founded
on
an
error
then
common
among
matrons
and
apothecaries
who
each
as
eagerly
as
the
others
professed
to
believe
that
the
normal
frame
of
a
man
was
physiologically
incapable
of
begetting
more
than
twins
and
that
all
over
the
number
of
pledges
which
the
father
can
produce
should
be
disowned
for
this
reason
poor
sidoine
was
convicted
by
the
judge
of
having
played
the
harlot
and
for
this
put
naked
on
an
ass
with
her
head
towards
the
tail
and
thus
led
through
the
town
to
the
pond
at
les
evés
where
she
was
ducked
three
times
she
would
scarcely
have
suffered
thus
if
her
wicked
husband
had
been
as
generously
gifted
by
dame
nature
as
good
philippe
xvii
in
front
of
rondonneau
s
the
glanced
to
right
and
left
to
see
that
he
was
not
being
spied
upon
he
had
heard
that
it
was
said
in
the
town
that
he
went
to
the
jeweller
s
house
for
assignations
and
that
madame
lacarelle
had
been
seen
following
him
into
this
house
called
the
house
of
the
two
satyrs
he
felt
very
over
this
he
had
another
cause
of
annoyance
which
had
treated
him
respectfully
for
a
long
time
had
attacked
him
vigorously
over
the
departmental
budget
he
was
censured
by
the
conservative
organ
for
having
made
a
transfer
to
conceal
the
expenses
of
the
electoral
propaganda
was
perfectly
honest
money
inspired
him
with
respect
as
well
as
love
he
felt
before
property
that
feeling
of
religious
terror
that
the
moon
inspires
in
dogs
with
him
wealth
had
become
a
cult
his
budget
was
very
honestly
put
together
and
apart
from
the
irregularities
that
had
now
become
regular
as
the
result
of
a
faulty
administration
common
to
the
whole
republic
nothing
worthy
of
blame
could
be
discovered
in
it
knew
this
he
felt
himself
strong
in
his
integrity
but
the
polemics
of
the
press
put
him
out
of
patience
his
heart
was
saddened
by
the
animosity
of
his
opponents
and
the
rancour
of
the
parties
that
he
believed
he
had
disarmed
after
so
many
sacrifices
he
was
pained
at
not
having
won
the
esteem
of
the
conservatives
which
he
secretly
valued
far
more
highly
than
the
friendship
of
the
republicans
he
would
have
to
inspire
with
pointed
and
forceful
replies
to
conduct
a
lively
and
perhaps
protracted
war
this
thought
was
harassing
to
the
deep
slothfulness
of
his
mind
and
alarming
to
his
prudence
which
feared
every
action
as
a
source
of
peril
thus
he
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
and
it
was
in
a
sharp
voice
that
throwing
himself
into
the
old
leather
he
inquired
of
rondonneau
junior
whether
guitrel
had
arrived
guitrel
had
not
yet
come
so
roughly
snatching
a
paper
from
the
jeweller
s
desk
tried
to
read
while
smoking
his
cigar
but
neither
political
ideas
nor
served
to
dispel
the
gloomy
pictures
that
crowded
into
his
mind
he
read
with
his
eyes
but
thought
of
the
attacks
of
transfer
there
are
not
fifty
people
in
the
county
town
who
know
what
a
transfer
is
and
here
i
can
see
all
the
idiots
in
the
department
shaking
their
heads
and
solemnly
repeating
the
phrase
in
their
newspaper
we
regret
to
see
that
has
not
abandoned
the
detestable
and
exploded
practice
of
making
he
fell
into
thought
the
ash
from
his
cigar
lavishly
bestrewed
his
waistcoat
he
went
on
thinking
why
does
attack
me
i
got
its
candidate
returned
my
department
shows
the
greatest
number
of
new
adherents
at
he
turned
over
the
page
of
the
paper
he
thought
on
again
i
have
not
covered
up
a
deficit
the
sums
voted
on
the
presentation
of
the
estimates
have
not
been
spent
in
a
different
way
from
what
was
proposed
these
people
don
t
know
how
to
read
a
budget
and
they
are
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
gloomy
indifferent
to
the
cigar
ash
which
covered
his
chest
and
thighs
he
plunged
into
the
reading
of
his
paper
his
eyes
fell
on
these
lines
we
learn
that
a
fire
having
broken
out
in
a
faubourg
of
tobolsk
sixty
wooden
houses
have
fallen
a
prey
to
the
flames
in
consequence
of
the
disaster
more
than
a
hundred
families
are
homeless
and
as
he
read
this
emitted
a
deep
shout
something
like
a
triumphal
growl
and
aiming
a
kick
at
the
jeweller
s
desk
i
say
rondonneau
tobolsk
is
a
russian
town
isn
t
it
rondonneau
raising
his
innocent
bald
head
towards
the
replied
that
tobolsk
was
indeed
a
town
in
asiatic
russia
well
cried
we
are
going
to
give
an
entertainment
for
the
benefit
of
the
sufferers
by
the
fire
at
and
he
added
between
his
teeth
i
ll
make
a
russian
entertainment
for
em
i
shall
have
six
weeks
peace
and
they
won
t
talk
any
more
about
at
that
moment
abbé
guitrel
with
anxious
eyes
his
hat
under
his
arm
entered
the
jeweller
s
shop
do
you
know
monsieur
l
abbé
said
the
to
him
that
by
general
request
i
am
authorising
entertainments
for
the
benefit
of
the
sufferers
from
the
fire
at
special
performances
bazaars
i
hope
that
the
church
will
join
in
these
benevolent
the
church
monsieur
replied
abbé
guitrel
has
her
hands
full
of
comfort
for
the
afflicted
who
come
to
her
and
doubtless
her
prayers
my
dear
abbé
your
affairs
are
not
getting
on
at
all
i
come
from
paris
i
saw
the
friends
whom
i
have
at
the
department
of
religion
and
i
bring
back
bad
news
to
start
with
there
are
eighteen
of
eighteen
eighteen
candidates
for
the
bishopric
of
tourcoing
in
the
first
rank
is
abbé
olivet
curé
of
one
of
the
richest
parishes
in
paris
and
the
president
s
candidate
next
there
is
abbé
lavardin
at
grenoble
ostensibly
he
is
supported
by
the
i
have
not
the
honour
of
knowing
lavardin
but
i
do
not
think
he
can
be
the
candidate
of
the
nunciature
it
is
possible
that
the
nuncio
has
his
favourite
but
assuredly
that
favourite
remains
unknown
the
nunciature
does
not
solicit
on
behalf
of
its
protégés
it
insists
on
their
ah
ah
monsieur
l
abbé
they
are
cute
at
the
monsieur
the
members
of
it
are
not
all
eminent
in
themselves
but
they
have
on
their
side
unbroken
tradition
and
their
action
is
guided
by
secular
rules
it
is
a
force
monsieur
a
great
by
jove
yes
but
we
were
saying
that
there
is
the
president
s
candidate
and
the
nuncio
s
candidate
there
is
also
your
own
archbishop
s
candidate
when
they
first
mentioned
him
i
thought
to
myself
that
it
was
you
we
were
wrong
my
poor
friend
monseigneur
charlot
s
ll
wager
you
won
t
guess
who
it
don
t
make
a
wager
monsieur
don
t
make
a
wager
i
would
bet
that
the
candidate
of
monseigneur
the
is
his
de
how
do
you
know
that
i
did
not
know
it
monsieur
you
are
not
unaware
that
monseigneur
charlot
dreads
that
he
may
find
himself
saddled
with
a
coadjutor
and
that
his
old
age
otherwise
so
august
and
serene
is
darkened
by
this
fear
he
is
afraid
lest
de
goulet
should
so
to
say
attract
this
nomination
to
himself
as
much
by
his
personal
merits
as
by
the
knowledge
that
he
has
acquired
of
the
affairs
of
the
diocese
and
his
eminence
is
still
more
desirous
and
even
impatient
to
separate
himself
from
his
since
de
goulet
belongs
by
birth
to
the
nobility
of
the
district
and
through
that
fact
shines
with
a
brilliancy
which
is
far
too
dazzling
for
monseigneur
charlot
since
on
the
contrary
monseigneur
does
not
rejoice
in
being
the
son
of
an
honest
artisan
who
like
saint
paul
worked
at
the
trade
of
weaver
you
know
monsieur
guitrel
that
they
also
talk
of
lantaigne
he
is
the
protégé
of
madame
cartier
de
chalmot
and
general
cartier
de
chalmot
although
clerical
and
reactionary
is
much
respected
in
paris
he
is
recognised
as
one
of
the
ablest
and
most
intelligent
of
our
generals
even
his
opinions
at
this
moment
are
advantageous
rather
than
harmful
to
him
with
a
ministry
disposed
to
reunion
reactionaries
get
all
that
they
want
they
are
needed
they
give
the
turn
to
the
scale
and
then
the
russian
alliance
and
the
czar
s
friendship
have
contributed
to
restore
to
the
aristocracy
and
the
army
of
our
nation
a
part
of
their
ancient
prestige
we
are
shunting
the
republic
on
to
a
certain
distinction
of
mind
and
manners
moreover
a
general
tendency
towards
authority
and
stability
is
declaring
itself
i
do
not
however
believe
that
lantaigne
has
great
chances
in
the
first
place
i
have
reported
most
unfavourably
with
regard
to
him
i
have
represented
him
in
high
places
as
a
militant
monarchist
i
have
described
his
uncompromising
ways
his
temperament
and
i
have
painted
a
sympathetic
portrait
of
you
my
dear
guitrel
i
have
shown
off
your
moderation
your
pliancy
your
politic
mind
your
respect
for
republican
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
your
kindness
monsieur
and
what
did
they
reply
you
want
to
know
that
well
they
replied
we
know
such
candidates
as
your
guitrel
once
nominated
they
are
worse
than
the
others
they
show
more
zeal
against
us
that
is
easily
accounted
for
they
have
more
to
beg
pardon
for
of
their
own
is
it
possible
monsieur
that
they
talked
like
this
in
high
places
ha
yes
and
my
interlocutor
added
this
i
do
not
like
candidates
for
the
episcopacy
who
show
too
much
zeal
for
our
institutions
if
i
could
get
a
hearing
the
choice
would
be
made
from
among
the
others
in
the
civil
and
political
ranks
they
prefer
officials
who
are
most
devoted
most
attached
to
the
government
nothing
can
be
better
but
there
are
no
priests
devoted
to
the
republic
in
this
case
the
wise
thing
is
always
to
take
the
most
honest
and
the
throwing
the
chewed
end
of
his
cigar
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
finished
with
these
words
you
see
my
poor
guitrel
that
your
affairs
are
not
making
guitrel
stammered
i
do
not
see
monsieur
i
do
not
perceive
anything
in
such
speeches
that
is
calculated
to
produce
in
you
this
impression
of
discouragement
on
the
contrary
i
should
rather
derive
from
it
a
sentiment
of
confidence
lit
a
cigar
and
said
with
a
laugh
who
knows
whether
they
are
not
right
at
the
bureaux
but
reassure
yourself
my
dear
abbé
i
do
not
abandon
you
let
s
see
whom
have
we
on
our
side
he
opened
his
left
hand
in
order
to
count
on
his
fingers
they
both
considered
they
found
a
senator
of
the
department
who
was
beginning
to
emerge
from
the
difficulties
into
which
the
recent
scandals
had
plunged
him
a
retired
general
politician
publicist
and
financier
the
bishop
of
ecbatana
well
known
in
the
artistic
world
and
théophile
mayer
the
friend
of
the
ministers
but
my
dear
guitrel
cried
the
you
have
only
the
and
bobtail
on
your
abbé
guitrel
endured
these
manners
but
he
did
not
like
them
he
looked
at
the
with
a
saddened
air
and
pressed
his
sinuous
lips
together
who
had
no
spite
regretted
the
playfulness
of
his
words
and
took
pains
to
console
the
old
man
come
come
they
are
by
no
means
the
worst
protectors
besides
my

anatole

i
do
not
believe
that
thorfin
karlsefne
was
more
astonished
and
delighted
when
he
discovered
america
than
i
was
when
in
my
sixtieth
year
this
great
literary
luminary
sailed
into
my
ken
i
have
three
good
reasons
for
writing
about
anatole
france
i
want
to
help
the
british
people
to
enjoy
his
work
i
want
them
to
accord
to
the
great
frenchman
the
full
justice
which
i
feel
he
has
not
yet
received
in
this
country
and
i
want
to
ease
my
soul
by
some
expression
of
my
own
gratitude
and
admiration
of
all
the
famous
or
popular
men
alive
upon
this
planet
anatole
france
is
to
me
the
greatest
there
is
no
writer
to
compare
to
him
and
he
has
few
peers
amongst
the
greatest
geniuses
of
past
ages
and
all
climes
penguin
island
is
a
masterpiece
and
a
classic
it
is
in
my
opinion
a
greater
work
than
gargantua
or
don
quixote
or
sartor
resartus
or
tristram
the
laughing
mocking
learned
and
dissolute
abbé
coignard
is
one
of
the
greatest
creations
of
human
genius
if
it
will
not
sound
too
audacious
i
will
venture
to
claim
that
there
is
no
character
in
rabelais
cervantes
dickens
or
sterne
to
equal
the
abbé
coignard
and
with
the
exception
of
the
miraculous
hamlet
there
is
nothing
greater
in
shakespeare
these
be
brave
i
am
writing
of
one
of
the
world
s
greatest
artists
and
humorists
of
anatole
france
the
master
then
there
is
the
great
scene
of
the
banquet
in
the
house
of
monsieur
de
la
geritande
which
i
have
read
fifty
times
and
hope
to
read
a
hundred
times
again
the
whole
chapter
is
one
of
the
most
artistic
humorous
human
and
exhilarating
achievements
in
literature
it
is
alive
it
is
real
it
goes
like
a
song
there
is
nothing
finer
or
stronger
in
the
best
comedy
work
of
shakespeare
anatole
france
is
a
great
man
and
there
is
no
living
celebrity
for
whom
i
have
so
much
reverence
