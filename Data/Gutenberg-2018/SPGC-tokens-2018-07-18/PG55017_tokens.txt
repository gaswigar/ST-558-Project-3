the
diary
of
john
william
polidori
introduction
a
person
whose
name
finds
mention
in
the
books
about
byron
and
to
some
extent
in
those
about
shelley
was
john
william
polidori
he
was
lord
byron
travelling
physician
in
when
his
lordship
quitted
england
soon
after
the
separation
from
his
wife
i
who
now
act
as
editor
of
his
diary
am
a
nephew
of
his
born
after
his
death
polidori
figures
not
very
advantageously
in
the
books
concerning
byron
and
shelley
he
is
exhibited
as
overweening
and
petulant
too
fond
of
putting
himself
forward
face
to
face
with
those
two
heroes
of
our
poetical
literature
and
too
touchy
when
either
of
them
declined
to
take
him
at
his
own
estimation
i
will
allow
that
this
judgment
of
polidori
is
so
far
as
it
goes
substantially
just
and
that
some
of
the
recorded
anecdotes
of
him
prove
him
deficient
in
lacking
prudence
and
reserve
and
ignoring
the
distinction
between
a
dignified
and
a
quarrelsome
attitude
of
mind
he
was
in
fact
extremely
young
when
he
went
abroad
in
april
with
byron
to
whom
he
had
been
recommended
by
sir
henry
halford
he
was
then
only
twenty
years
of
age
born
on
september
byron
being
and
shelley
the
recommendation
given
to
so
very
young
a
man
is
a
little
surprising
it
would
be
a
mistake
however
to
suppose
that
polidori
was
without
some
solid
attainments
and
some
considerable
share
of
talent
he
was
the
son
of
gaetano
polidori
a
tuscan
man
of
letters
who
after
being
secretary
to
the
celebrated
dramatist
alfieri
had
settled
in
london
as
a
teacher
of
italian
and
of
his
english
wife
a
miss
pierce
the
parents
my
maternal
survived
to
a
great
age
only
dying
in
john
polidori
after
receiving
his
education
in
the
roman
catholic
college
of
ampleforth
yorkshire
studied
medicine
in
edinburgh
and
took
his
doctor
degree
at
a
singularly
early
believe
almost
age
of
nineteen
his
ambition
was
fully
as
much
for
literary
as
for
professional
distinction
and
he
published
besides
to
which
i
shall
have
to
recur
a
prose
tale
named
a
volume
of
verse
containing
a
drama
entitled
and
some
other
writings
one
of
these
writings
is
the
text
to
a
volume
published
in
entitled
illustrative
of
the
manners
and
costumes
of
france
switzerland
and
by
bridgens
the
name
of
polidori
is
not
indeed
recorded
in
this
book
but
i
know
as
a
certainty
that
he
was
the
writer
one
of
the
designs
in
the
volume
shows
the
costume
of
women
at
lerici
just
about
the
time
when
shelley
was
staying
there
in
the
closing
months
of
his
life
and
a
noticeable
costume
it
was
polidori
i
am
not
aware
that
he
ever
received
any
instruction
in
drawing
worth
speaking
some
considerable
native
gift
in
sketching
faces
and
figures
with
lifelike
expression
i
possess
a
few
examples
to
prove
as
much
the
diary
shows
that
he
took
some
serious
and
intelligent
interest
in
works
of
art
as
well
as
in
literature
and
he
was
clearly
a
rapid
and
somewhat
caustic
judge
of
a
correct
one
he
was
a
fine
rather
young
man
as
evidenced
by
his
portrait
in
the
national
portrait
gallery
accepted
from
me
by
that
institution
in
polidori
life
was
a
short
one
not
long
after
quitting
lord
byron
in
he
returned
to
london
and
in
norwich
continued
his
medical
career
but
eventually
relinquished
this
and
began
studying
for
the
bar
it
is
said
that
miss
harriett
martineau
was
rather
in
love
with
him
in
norwich
in
august
he
committed
suicide
with
through
losses
in
gambling
incurred
a
debt
of
honour
which
he
had
no
present
means
of
clearing
off
that
he
did
take
poison
prussic
acid
was
a
fact
perfectly
well
known
in
his
family
but
it
is
curious
to
note
that
the
and
disposed
coroner
jury
were
content
to
return
a
verdict
without
eliciting
any
distinct
evidence
as
to
the
cause
of
death
and
they
simply
pronounced
that
he
had
died
by
the
visitation
of
god
the
matter
was
reported
in
two
papers
and
new
i
possess
a
copy
made
by
my
mother
at
the
time
of
the
reports
and
it
may
perhaps
be
as
well
inserted
here
from
the
monday
evening
melancholy
polidori
residing
in
great
pulteney
street
retired
to
rest
about
his
usual
time
on
thursday
night
the
servant
not
finding
him
rise
at
the
usual
hour
yesterday
went
to
his
room
between
eleven
and
twelve
and
found
him
groaning
and
apparently
in
the
last
agonies
of
death
an
alarm
was
given
and
medical
aid
was
immediately
called
but
before
the
arrival
of
surgeons
copeland
and
davies
he
was
no
more
his
father
was
at
the
time
on
his
journey
to
london
to
see
his
son
and
arrived
about
three
hours
after
the
event
we
understand
the
deceased
was
about
years
of
age
and
had
for
some
time
accompanied
lord
byron
in
italy
a
coroner
inquest
will
sit
this
day
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
his
death
from
the
new
tuesday
coroner
inquest
on
john
polidori
inquisition
has
been
taken
before
higgs
esquire
deputy
coroner
at
the
residence
of
the
father
of
the
above
unfortunate
gentleman
in
great
pulteney
street
golden
square
who
was
discovered
lying
on
his
bed
in
a
state
nearly
approaching
to
death
and
soon
afterwards
expired
charlotte
reed
the
servant
to
gaetano
polidori
the
father
of
the
deceased
said
her
master
son
lived
in
the
house
and
for
some
time
had
been
indisposed
on
monday
the
of
august
last
he
returned
from
brighton
since
which
his
conduct
manifested
strong
symptoms
of
incoherence
and
he
gave
his
order
for
dinner
in
a
very
strange
manner
on
the
thursday
following
the
deceased
dined
with
a
gentleman
residing
in
the
same
house
and
on
that
occasion
he
appeared
very
much
depressed
in
his
spirits
about
nine
the
same
evening
he
ordered
witness
to
leave
a
glass
tumbler
in
his
room
this
was
unusual
but
one
was
placed
as
he
desired
deceased
told
her
he
was
unwell
if
therefore
he
did
not
get
up
by
twelve
the
next
day
not
to
disturb
him
witness
however
a
few
minutes
before
twelve
went
into
his
room
to
open
the
shutters
and
on
her
return
saw
the
deceased
lying
in
bed
he
was
not
in
any
unusual
position
but
seemed
extremely
ill
witness
immediately
left
the
room
went
upstairs
and
communicated
what
she
had
observed
to
a
gentleman
who
instantly
came
down
witness
then
went
for
medical
assistance
the
deceased
was
about
years
of
john
deagostini
the
gentleman
alluded
to
by
the
last
witness
corroborated
her
statement
on
his
giving
him
the
invitation
to
dine
which
he
accepted
in
a
way
quite
different
from
his
usual
conduct
witness
also
observed
that
some
time
since
the
deceased
had
met
with
an
thrown
out
of
his
gig
and
seriously
hurt
in
the
head
on
thursday
at
dinner
he
spoke
in
half
sentences
the
conversation
was
on
politics
and
a
future
state
the
deceased
observed
rather
harshly
that
witness
would
see
more
than
him
he
appeared
to
be
deranged
in
his
mind
and
his
countenance
was
haggard
at
dinner
he
ate
very
little
soon
after
left
the
room
but
joined
again
at
tea
hardly
spoke
a
word
and
retired
at
nine
after
breakfast
next
morning
witness
inquired
of
the
servant
whether
polidori
had
gone
out
she
replied
no
and
that
he
had
desired
her
not
to
disturb
him
about
twelve
the
servant
came
to
him
very
much
alarmed
witness
went
immediately
to
the
apartment
of
the
deceased
and
observed
a
tumbler
on
the
chair
which
contained
nothing
but
water
and
did
not
perceive
any
deleterious
substance
that
the
deceased
might
have
taken
he
was
senseless
and
apparently
in
a
dying
thomas
copeland
a
surgeon
residing
in
golden
square
was
sent
for
suddenly
to
attend
the
deceased
and
attempted
to
discharge
the
contents
of
the
stomach
without
effect
he
lingered
for
about
ten
minutes
and
expired
another
medical
gentleman
soon
after
arrived
but
his
assistance
was
also
being
no
further
evidence
adduced
to
prove
how
the
deceased
came
to
his
death
the
jury
under
these
circumstances
returned
a
verdict
by
the
visitation
of
god
medwin
in
his
with
lord
gives
the
following
account
of
how
the
poet
received
the
news
of
polidori
death
i
was
convinced
said
byron
something
very
unpleasant
hung
over
me
last
night
i
expected
to
hear
that
somebody
i
knew
was
dead
so
it
turns
polidori
is
gone
when
he
was
my
physician
he
was
always
talking
of
prussic
acid
oil
of
amber
blowing
into
veins
suffocating
by
charcoal
and
compounding
poisons
but
for
a
different
purpose
to
what
the
pontic
monarch
did
for
he
has
prescribed
a
dose
for
himself
that
would
have
killed
fifty
dose
whose
effect
murray
says
was
so
instantaneous
that
he
went
off
without
a
spasm
or
struggle
it
seems
that
disappointment
was
the
cause
of
this
rash
act
evidence
of
the
servant
at
the
inquest
shows
that
death
did
not
come
so
very
suddenly
and
in
my
own
family
i
always
heard
the
poison
spoken
of
as
simply
prussic
acid
this
is
all
that
i
need
say
at
present
to
explain
who
polidori
was
but
i
must
add
a
few
words
regarding
his
diary
the
day
when
the
young
doctor
obtained
the
post
of
travelling
physician
to
the
famous
poet
and
man
of
fashion
lord
byron
about
to
leave
england
for
the
continent
must
no
doubt
have
been
regarded
by
him
and
by
some
of
his
family
as
a
supremely
auspicious
one
although
in
fact
it
turned
out
the
reverse
the
article
on
polidori
written
in
dictionary
of
national
by
my
valued
friend
the
late
garnett
speaks
of
him
as
physician
and
to
lord
byron
but
i
never
heard
that
he
undertook
or
performed
any
secretarial
work
worth
speaking
of
and
i
decidedly
believe
that
he
did
not
the
same
statement
occurs
in
the
inscription
on
his
likeness
in
the
national
portrait
gallery
polidori
father
had
foreseen
in
the
byronic
scheme
disappointment
as
only
too
likely
and
he
opposed
the
project
but
without
success
to
be
the
daily
companion
and
intimate
of
so
great
a
man
as
byron
to
visit
foreign
scenes
in
his
society
to
travel
into
his
own
father
native
land
which
he
regarded
with
a
feeling
of
enthusiasm
and
with
whose
language
he
was
naturally
well
acquainted
to
be
thus
launched
upon
a
career
promising
the
utmost
development
and
satisfaction
to
his
literary
as
well
as
professional
this
may
have
seemed
like
the
realization
of
a
dream
almost
too
good
to
be
true
to
crown
all
murray
byron
publisher
had
offered
polidori
no
less
a
sum
than
or
guineas
for
an
account
of
his
forthcoming
tour
polidori
therefore
began
to
keep
a
diary
heading
it
of
a
journey
through
flanders
from
april
and
the
blank
was
eventually
filled
in
with
the
date
december
it
should
rather
stand
december
portions
of
the
diary
are
written
with
some
detail
and
a
perceptible
aim
at
literary
being
manifestly
in
view
in
other
instances
the
jottings
are
slight
and
merely
enough
for
guiding
the
memory
on
this
footing
the
journal
goes
on
up
to
june
it
was
then
dropped
as
polidori
notes
through
neglect
and
dissipation
for
he
saw
a
great
deal
of
company
on
september
he
wrote
up
some
summarized
reminiscences
and
from
september
the
day
when
he
parted
company
with
byron
at
cologny
near
geneva
and
proceeded
to
journey
through
italy
on
his
own
account
he
continued
with
some
regularity
up
to
december
when
he
was
sojourning
in
pisa
that
is
the
latest
day
of
which
any
record
remains
but
it
is
known
from
other
evidence
that
polidori
continued
in
italy
up
to
april
he
then
left
venice
in
company
with
the
new
earl
of
guilford
and
his
their
travelling
physician
whether
the
journal
is
in
any
fair
degree
interesting
or
brightly
written
is
a
question
which
the
reader
will
settle
for
himself
as
a
document
relevant
to
the
life
of
two
illustrious
poets
it
certainly
merits
some
degree
of
attention
my
own
first
acquaintance
with
the
diary
of
polidori
dates
back
to
when
i
was
preparing
the
memoir
of
shelley
which
preludes
my
edition
of
his
poems
published
in
i
then
availed
myself
of
the
shelleian
information
contained
in
the
diary
and
even
gave
two
or
three
verbatim
extracts
from
it
the
book
was
at
that
time
the
property
of
a
sister
of
his
miss
charlotte
lydia
polidori
a
lady
of
advanced
age
i
regret
to
say
that
my
aunt
on
receiving
the
back
from
me
took
it
into
her
head
to
read
it
thing
which
i
fancy
she
had
never
before
done
or
certainly
had
not
done
for
very
many
years
and
that
she
found
in
it
some
few
passages
which
she
held
to
be
improper
and
with
the
severe
virtue
so
characteristic
of
an
english
maiden
aunt
she
determined
that
those
passages
should
no
longer
exist
i
can
remember
one
about
byron
and
a
chambermaid
at
ostend
and
another
later
on
about
polidori
himself
my
aunt
therefore
took
the
trouble
of
copying
out
the
whole
diary
minus
the
peccant
passages
and
she
then
ruthlessly
destroyed
the
original
after
her
occurred
in
january
when
she
had
attained
the
age
of
transcript
came
into
my
possession
its
authority
is
only
a
shade
less
safe
than
that
of
the
original
and
it
is
from
the
transcript
that
i
have
had
to
work
in
compiling
my
present
volume
i
will
now
refer
in
some
detail
to
the
matter
of
polidori
romantic
tale
not
only
because
this
matter
is
of
some
literary
interest
in
itself
but
more
especially
because
the
account
of
it
given
in
dictionary
of
national
treats
polidori
in
this
regard
with
no
indulgence
and
i
believe
however
unintentionally
on
the
part
of
the
late
garnett
with
less
than
justice
he
says
in
april
he
polidori
published
in
new
monthly
and
also
in
the
celebrated
story
of
which
he
attributed
to
byron
the
ascription
was
fictitious
byron
had
in
fact
in
june
begun
to
write
at
geneva
a
story
with
this
title
in
emulation
of
shelley
but
dropped
it
before
reaching
the
superstition
which
it
was
to
have
illustrated
he
sent
the
fragment
to
murray
upon
the
appearance
of
polidori
fabrication
and
it
is
inserted
in
his
works
he
further
protested
in
a
carelessly
disclaimer
addressed
to
the
facts
of
the
case
appear
to
be
as
follows
as
we
shall
see
in
the
diary
polidori
began
near
geneva
a
tale
which
according
to
shelley
was
about
a
lady
and
he
was
clearly
aware
that
byron
had
commenced
a
story
about
a
vampyre
after
quitting
byron
polidori
in
conversation
with
the
countess
of
breuss
mentioned
in
his
journal
spoke
unless
we
are
to
discredit
his
own
account
of
the
subject
of
the
great
poet
tale
the
countess
questioned
whether
anything
could
be
made
of
such
a
theme
and
polidori
then
tried
his
hand
at
carrying
it
out
he
left
the
with
the
countess
and
thought
little
or
no
more
about
it
after
his
departure
from
that
neighbourhood
some
person
who
was
travelling
there
one
might
perhaps
infer
a
lady
obtained
the
either
from
the
countess
of
breuss
or
from
some
person
acquainted
with
the
countess
this
would
i
suppose
be
the
madame
gatelier
who
is
named
in
the
journal
along
with
the
countess
the
traveller
then
forwarded
the
tale
to
the
publisher
colburn
telling
this
statement
was
printed
by
colburn
as
an
of
a
letter
from
certain
tales
were
undertaken
by
lord
b
yron
the
physician
polidori
and
miss
godwin
and
that
the
writer
received
from
her
female
friend
the
outline
of
each
of
these
stories
she
did
not
say
that
the
completed
was
the
production
of
byron
but
colburn
inferred
this
and
in
the
magazine
he
attributed
it
to
byron
printing
his
name
as
author
among
the
papers
which
were
left
by
polidori
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
which
have
come
into
my
possession
are
the
drafts
of
two
letters
of
addressed
to
henry
colburn
and
the
other
to
the
editor
of
morning
these
letters
were
actually
dispatched
and
having
no
sort
of
reason
to
suspect
the
contrary
i
assume
that
they
contain
a
truthful
account
of
the
facts
if
so
they
exonerate
polidori
from
the
imputation
of
having
planned
or
connived
at
a
literary
imposture
in
his
letter
to
colburn
he
affirms
as
will
be
seen
that
the
following
incidents
in
his
tale
were
borrowed
from
byron
project
the
departure
of
two
friends
from
england
one
of
them
dying
in
greece
but
it
is
in
fact
near
ephesus
after
exacting
from
his
companion
an
oath
not
to
mention
his
death
the
revival
of
the
dead
man
and
his
then
making
love
to
the
sister
of
his
late
companion
the
story
begun
by
byron
and
published
along
with
contains
the
incidents
above
named
except
only
the
important
incident
of
the
dead
revival
and
his
subsequent
byron
extant
writing
which
is
a
mere
fragment
affords
no
trace
of
that
upshot
but
polidori
must
have
known
that
such
was
the
intended
sequel
it
may
be
added
that
the
resemblance
between
these
productions
of
byron
and
of
polidori
extends
only
to
incidents
the
form
of
narrative
is
different
i
proceed
to
give
the
letter
of
polidori
to
colburn
followed
by
the
letter
to
the
editor
of
morning
this
latter
goes
over
a
good
deal
of
the
same
ground
as
the
letter
to
colburn
so
i
shorten
it
very
considerably
john
polidori
to
henry
colburn
london
sir
i
received
a
copy
of
the
magazine
of
last
april
the
present
month
and
am
sorry
to
find
that
your
genevan
correspondent
has
led
you
into
a
mistake
with
regard
to
the
tale
of
is
lord
byron
but
was
written
by
me
at
the
request
of
a
lady
who
upon
my
mentioning
that
his
lordship
had
said
that
it
was
his
intention
of
writing
a
ghost
story
depending
for
interest
upon
the
circumstances
of
two
friends
leaving
england
and
one
dying
in
greece
the
other
finding
him
alive
upon
his
return
and
making
love
to
his
sister
saying
that
she
thought
it
impossible
to
work
up
such
materials
desired
i
would
write
it
for
her
which
i
did
in
two
idle
mornings
by
her
side
these
circumstances
above
mentioned
and
the
one
of
the
dying
man
having
obtained
an
oath
that
the
survivor
should
not
in
any
way
disclose
his
decease
are
the
only
parts
of
the
tale
belonging
to
his
lordship
i
desire
therefore
that
you
will
positively
contradict
your
statement
in
the
next
number
by
the
insertion
of
this
note
with
regard
to
my
own
tale
it
is
imperfect
and
unfinished
i
had
rather
therefore
it
should
not
appear
in
the
magazine
and
if
the
editor
had
sent
his
communication
as
he
mentions
he
would
have
been
spared
this
mistake
but
sir
there
is
one
circumstance
of
which
i
must
request
a
further
explanation
i
observe
upon
the
back
of
your
publication
the
announcement
of
a
separate
edition
now
upon
buying
this
i
find
that
it
states
in
the
that
it
was
entered
into
stationers
hall
upon
march
consequently
before
your
magazine
was
published
i
wish
therefore
to
ask
for
information
how
this
tale
passed
from
the
hands
of
your
editor
into
those
of
a
publisher
as
it
is
a
mere
trifle
i
should
have
had
no
objection
to
its
appearing
in
your
magazine
as
i
could
in
common
with
any
other
have
extracted
it
thence
and
republished
it
but
i
shall
not
sit
patiently
by
and
see
it
taken
without
my
consent
and
appropriated
by
any
person
as
therefore
it
must
have
passed
through
your
hands
as
stated
in
the
magazine
from
a
correspondent
i
shall
expect
that
you
will
account
to
me
for
the
publishers
sherwood
and
neely
having
possession
of
it
and
appropriating
it
to
themselves
and
demand
either
that
a
compensation
be
made
me
or
that
its
separate
publication
be
instantly
suppressed
hoping
for
an
immediate
answer
which
will
save
me
the
trouble
of
obtaining
an
injunction
i
remain
sir
your
obedient
servant
john
polidori
to
the
editor
of
morning
sir
as
you
were
the
first
person
to
whom
i
wrote
to
state
that
the
tale
of
was
not
lord
byron
i
beg
you
to
insert
the
following
statement
in
your
paper
the
tale
as
i
stated
to
you
in
my
letter
was
written
upon
the
foundation
of
a
purposed
and
begun
story
of
lord
byron
lord
byron
in
a
letter
dated
venice
stated
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
vampyre
story
and
hated
vampyres
but
while
this
letter
was
busily
circulating
in
all
the
london
and
provincial
papers
the
fragment
at
the
end
of
was
in
the
hands
of
his
publishers
in
albemarle
street
with
the
date
of
june
attached
to
it
being
the
beginning
of
his
tale
upon
this
very
foundation
my
development
was
written
on
the
continent
and
left
with
a
lady
at
whose
request
it
was
undertaken
in
the
course
of
three
mornings
by
her
side
it
was
produced
and
left
with
her
from
her
hands
by
means
of
a
correspondent
without
my
knowledge
it
came
into
those
of
the
editor
of
new
with
a
letter
stating
it
to
be
an
of
lord
byron
watts
as
editor
of
that
magazine
stated
in
notice
that
the
tale
which
accompanies
the
letters
we
also
present
to
our
readers
without
pledging
ourselves
for
its
authenticity
as
the
production
of
lord
byron
and
he
continues
we
should
suppose
it
to
have
been
committed
to
paper
rather
from
the
recital
of
a
third
person
this
however
after
the
publication
of
copies
was
cancelled
by
the
and
another
notice
inserted
stating
it
to
be
decidedly
his
lordship
in
direct
opposition
as
i
am
informed
to
the
has
since
retired
from
the
conduct
of
the
magazine
immediately
it
was
published
i
procured
a
copy
and
upon
finding
that
it
was
an
almost
forgotten
trifle
of
my
own
instantly
wrote
to
you
as
editor
of
morning
stating
the
little
share
lord
byron
had
in
the
work
this
was
upon
the
friday
evening
after
its
publication
i
at
the
same
time
wrote
to
the
publishers
of
the
tale
in
its
separate
form
and
to
those
of
the
magazine
to
stop
its
sale
under
his
lordship
name
on
monday
the
publishers
of
the
magazine
called
upon
me
and
promised
it
should
be
instantly
announced
as
mine
when
i
came
to
claim
my
share
in
the
profits
i
was
offered
instead
of
nearly
your
obedient
servant
john
polidori
the
prefatory
note
to
in
new
monthly
runs
thus
we
received
several
private
letters
in
the
course
of
last
autumn
from
a
friend
travelling
on
the
continent
and
among
others
the
following
which
we
give
to
the
public
on
account
of
its
containing
anecdotes
of
an
individual
concerning
whom
the
most
trifling
circumstances
if
they
tend
to
mark
even
the
minor
features
of
his
mind
can
not
fail
of
being
considered
important
and
valuable
by
those
who
know
how
to
appreciate
his
erratic
but
transcendent
genius
the
tale
which
accompanied
the
letter
we
have
also
much
pleasure
in
presenting
to
our
there
is
also
a
final
note
thus
we
have
in
our
possession
the
tale
of
as
well
as
the
outline
of
that
of
miss
godwin
the
latter
has
already
appeared
under
the
title
of
or
the
modern
the
former
however
upon
consulting
with
its
author
we
may
probably
hereafter
give
to
our
two
questions
arise
as
to
that
prefatory
note
did
the
editor
really
write
it
or
did
the
publisher
colburn
write
it
is
the
averment
true
or
false
that
the
editor
or
the
publisher
had
received
in
the
course
of
the
preceding
autumn
several
private
letters
from
the
same
person
who
had
now
forwarded
a
letter
enclosing
murray
wrote
to
lord
byron
on
april
he
speaks
of
the
publication
of
in
new
monthly
and
afterwards
in
and
proceeds
the
editor
of
that
journal
has
quarrelled
with
the
publisher
and
has
called
this
morning
to
exculpate
himself
from
the
baseness
of
the
transaction
he
says
that
he
received
it
from
polidori
for
a
small
sum
polidori
averring
that
the
whole
plan
of
it
was
yours
and
that
it
was
merely
written
out
by
him
the
editor
inserted
it
with
a
short
statement
to
this
effect
but
to
his
astonishment
colburn
cancelled
the
leaf
he
informs
me
that
polidori
finding
that
the
sale
exceeded
his
expectation
and
that
he
had
sold
it
too
cheap
went
to
the
editor
and
declared
that
he
would
deny
it
this
statement
by
murray
makes
it
probable
that
the
paragraph
purporting
to
come
from
the
editor
or
some
substantial
part
of
it
really
emanated
from
the
publisher
and
the
same
is
definitely
asserted
in
letter
to
morning
but
murray
letter
does
not
settle
the
question
whether
the
allegation
about
a
traveller
at
geneva
was
true
or
false
the
editor
assertion
that
he
received
it
from
polidori
for
a
small
sum
does
not
by
any
means
clear
up
all
the
facts
it
seems
quite
possible
that
there
really
was
a
correspondent
at
geneva
who
sent
to
the
editor
the
of
along
with
that
of
other
tale
and
an
outline
of
mary
shelley
as
expressly
affirmed
in
the
final
note
signed
ed
and
that
the
editor
having
no
right
to
publish
unless
by
authority
of
its
writer
spoke
to
polidori
about
it
how
could
polidori
dispose
of
it
for
a
small
sum
if
he
alleged
that
it
was
written
by
byron
or
by
any
one
other
than
himself
he
averred
that
the
whole
plan
of
it
was
this
is
apparently
true
adding
that
it
was
merely
written
out
by
the
sense
not
of
having
written
from
dictation
but
of
having
composed
a
story
founded
upon
byron
intended
incidents
murray
final
polidori
went
to
the
editor
and
declared
that
he
would
deny
it
loosely
expressed
but
seems
to
mean
that
he
would
deny
byron
authorship
of
so
in
fact
he
did
if
we
suppose
as
did
murray
apparently
that
polidori
had
in
the
first
instance
planned
a
deliberate
imposture
and
had
palmed
off
upon
the
editor
as
being
virtually
the
writing
of
byron
we
are
encountered
by
three
difficulties
left
unexplained
what
plea
could
polidori
advance
for
having
the
and
the
right
of
publishing
it
why
did
he
sell
for
a
sum
a
work
which
if
written
by
the
lord
byron
would
be
worth
a
very
considerable
sum
why
did
the
editor
pay
to
polidori
a
sum
whether
small
or
large
for
a
book
which
according
to
this
assumption
was
avowedly
not
the
writing
of
himself
but
the
writing
and
property
of
byron
all
these
difficulties
are
avoided
and
no
other
serious
difficulties
arise
if
we
assume
that
the
account
given
by
polidori
is
the
true
one
viz
that
he
offered
the
tale
to
the
editor
as
being
his
own
composition
strictly
modelled
upon
a
series
of
incidents
invented
by
byron
polidori
letter
addressed
to
the
editor
of
morning
was
as
i
have
already
said
delivered
to
the
office
of
that
paper
it
was
not
however
published
there
as
sherwood
neely
and
jones
the
publishers
of
in
its
represented
to
polidori
that
the
appearance
of
such
a
letter
would
tend
to
compromise
them
and
he
therefore
out
of
consideration
for
this
firm
withdrew
the
letter
unprinted
this
is
polidori
own
statement
contained
in
the
introduction
to
another
romantic
tale
of
his
published
in
being
the
tale
by
polidori
which
as
stated
by
the
editor
of
new
monthly
had
been
sent
to
him
along
with
and
the
outline
of
besides
all
this
the
doctor
wrote
a
brief
letter
published
in
on
may
was
clearly
the
though
the
groundwork
is
certainly
lord
byron
its
development
is
mine
i
must
now
revert
for
a
moment
to
the
lady
in
the
introduction
above
named
polidori
asserts
that
that
tale
was
the
one
which
he
began
at
cologny
it
does
not
contain
any
sort
of
mention
of
any
lady
there
is
some
supernatural
machinery
in
the
story
of
a
rather
futile
kind
it
could
be
excluded
without
affecting
the
real
basis
of
the
narrative
which
relates
the
and
marriage
of
a
young
swiss
patriot
with
a
lady
who
is
ultimately
identified
as
his
sister
as
to
shelley
allegation
that
the
lady
was
punished
for
peeping
through
a
keyhole
no
such
incident
exists
in
there
is
however
a
passage
where
a
certain
julia
seeks
to
solve
a
mystery
by
looking
through
the
wainscot
of
a
closet
for
wood
her
head
after
this
inspection
remains
exactly
what
it
was
before
was
in
its
way
a
great
success
as
stated
in
dictionary
of
national
byron
name
gave
production
great
celebrity
on
the
continent
where
was
held
to
be
quite
the
thing
which
it
behoved
byron
to
have
written
it
formed
the
groundwork
of
marschner
opera
and
nearly
half
a
volume
of
dumas
is
occupied
by
an
account
of
the
representation
of
a
french
play
founded
upon
it
the
diary
left
london
at
in
the
morning
with
lord
byron
scrope
davies
and
hobhouse
esq
scrope
berdmore
davies
had
been
one
of
byron
and
intimates
at
cambridge
university
and
had
continued
familiar
with
him
at
newstead
abbey
and
elsewhere
he
has
been
described
as
no
less
remarkable
for
elegance
of
taste
than
for
a
generous
john
cam
hobhouse
afterwards
sir
hobhouse
and
ultimately
lord
broughton
de
gifford
was
it
need
hardly
be
said
a
peculiarly
close
friend
of
byron
he
had
accompanied
him
in
his
travels
in
greece
prior
to
the
commencement
of
wrote
notes
to
that
poem
and
to
the
last
upheld
the
essential
fineness
of
his
character
byron
intention
to
travel
along
with
hobhouse
in
the
spring
of
was
not
a
new
project
conceived
in
consequence
of
his
separation
only
completed
on
april
from
his
wife
he
had
entertained
this
scheme
before
his
daughter
ada
was
born
on
december
and
had
announced
it
to
his
wife
to
whom
the
notion
was
not
agreeable
the
view
from
shooter
hill
was
extensive
and
beautiful
being
on
a
much
larger
scale
than
the
view
from
stirling
polidori
mentions
stirling
as
being
no
doubt
a
reminiscence
of
his
own
from
the
days
when
he
had
been
in
edinburgh
to
take
his
medical
degree
the
plain
enamelled
with
various
colours
according
to
the
different
growth
of
the
corn
spread
far
before
our
sight
was
divided
irregularly
by
the
river
the
thames
next
with
its
majestic
waves
flowed
in
the
plain
below
bearing
numerous
fleets
upon
its
flood
its
banks
in
many
parts
were
beautiful
the
chalky
banks
were
alternated
with
the
swelling
hills
rising
from
the
waves
of
the
pleasing
the
effect
of
the
first
dawn
of
spring
on
the
vegetable
creation
at
canterbury
we
saw
the
cathedral
i
know
not
how
it
was
whether
my
mind
had
been
prepared
by
the
previous
sight
of
glorious
nature
to
receive
pleasing
impressions
but
the
spot
where
the
high
altar
and
thomas
à
becket
tomb
stood
seemed
to
me
one
of
the
most
beautiful
effects
that
i
had
ever
seen
arising
from
architecture
for
though
it
had
not
all
the
airiness
and
height
that
i
had
seen
in
other
cathedrals
yet
its
simple
beauty
pleased
me
more
than
anything
i
had
yet
seen
remounting
we
soon
arrived
at
dover
where
we
slept
when
the
captain
had
sufficiently
disturbed
us
day
was
spent
at
dover
the
greater
part
was
occupied
in
procuring
what
had
been
neglected
in
london
and
in
seeing
the
carriage
well
packed
up
after
dinner
however
we
went
in
search
of
churchill
tomb
raised
we
had
learned
to
his
memory
by
his
friend
wilkes
arrived
at
the
house
of
the
sexton
he
led
us
to
a
ruined
church
passing
through
which
we
came
into
a
churchyard
where
children
heedless
and
unconscious
of
what
they
trampled
on
sportively
ran
amid
the
raised
turf
graves
he
pointed
out
to
us
a
tombstone
undistinguished
from
those
of
the
tradesmen
near
him
having
merely
like
them
a
square
tablet
stuck
into
the
ground
whereon
was
written
here
lie
the
remains
of
the
celebrated
churchill
life
to
the
last
enjoyed
here
churchill
lies
by
churchill
the
green
turf
was
beginning
already
to
decay
upon
his
tomb
which
when
the
sexton
heard
us
lamenting
he
assured
us
that
his
grave
as
well
as
the
rest
would
be
newly
decked
as
soon
as
nature
had
vested
its
fullest
that
was
an
old
custom
churchill
owed
then
only
to
a
common
hand
what
the
pride
of
a
friend
safety
of
his
wilkes
only
sought
the
gratification
of
his
vanity
while
he
consigned
his
friend
last
relics
to
the
keeping
of
a
tablet
he
consigned
his
own
pride
in
such
a
friend
to
the
keeping
of
a
column
in
his
own
grounds
yet
i
do
not
know
whether
the
scene
was
not
more
moving
though
no
vainly
pompous
inscription
pointed
out
the
spot
where
this
poet
was
buried
there
were
two
authors
one
the
most
distinguished
of
his
age
another
whose
name
is
rising
rapidly
and
a
third
ambitious
for
literary
distinction
what
a
lesson
it
was
for
them
when
having
asked
the
sexton
if
he
knew
why
so
many
came
to
see
this
tomb
he
said
i
can
not
tell
i
had
not
the
burying
of
him
byron
after
settling
in
the
villa
diodati
near
geneva
recorded
this
same
incident
in
a
composition
entitled
grave
a
fact
literally
he
wrote
a
memorandum
to
say
that
in
this
poem
he
had
intentionally
imitated
the
style
of
wordsworth
its
beauties
and
its
defects
the
composition
therefore
is
essentially
in
method
and
perhaps
wordsworth
would
not
have
recognized
in
it
many
of
his
own
beauties
the
lines
are
as
i
stood
beside
the
grave
of
him
who
blazed
the
comet
of
a
season
and
i
saw
the
humblest
of
all
sepulchres
and
gazed
with
not
the
less
of
sorrow
and
of
awe
on
that
neglected
turf
and
quiet
stone
with
name
no
clearer
than
the
names
unknown
which
lay
unread
around
it
and
i
the
gardener
of
that
ground
why
it
might
be
that
for
this
plant
strangers
his
memory
task
through
the
thick
deaths
of
half
a
century
and
thus
he
answered
i
do
not
know
why
frequent
travellers
turn
to
pilgrims
so
he
died
before
my
day
of
sextonship
and
i
had
not
the
digging
of
this
grave
and
is
this
all
i
thought
and
do
we
rip
the
veil
of
immortality
and
crave
i
know
not
what
of
honour
and
of
light
through
unborn
ages
to
endure
this
blight
so
soon
and
so
successless
as
i
said
the
architect
of
all
on
which
we
tread
for
earth
is
but
a
tombstone
did
essay
to
extricate
remembrance
from
the
clay
whose
minglings
might
confuse
a
newton
thought
were
it
not
that
all
life
must
end
in
one
of
which
we
are
but
dreamers
as
he
caught
as
the
twilight
of
a
former
sun
thus
spoke
he
believe
the
man
of
whom
you
wot
who
lies
in
this
selected
tomb
was
a
most
famous
writer
in
his
day
and
therefore
travellers
step
from
out
their
way
to
pay
him
honour
myself
your
honour
pleases
then
most
pleased
i
shook
from
out
my
pocket
avaricious
nook
some
certain
coins
of
silver
which
as
perforce
i
gave
this
i
could
spare
so
much
but
inconveniently
ye
smile
i
see
ye
ye
profane
ones
all
the
while
because
my
homely
phrase
the
truth
would
tell
you
are
the
fools
not
i
for
i
did
dwell
with
a
deep
thought
and
with
a
softened
eye
on
that
old
sexton
natural
homily
in
which
there
was
obscurity
and
the
glory
and
the
nothing
of
a
name
charles
churchill
the
satirist
a
clergyman
who
had
given
up
his
standing
in
the
church
had
died
in
at
boulogne
aged
only
it
is
clear
that
his
renown
was
still
considerable
in
it
is
now
barely
more
than
a
literary
reminiscence
we
then
returned
home
where
having
delivered
my
play
into
their
hands
i
had
to
hear
it
laughed
an
author
has
always
a
salvo
partly
i
think
from
the
way
in
which
it
was
read
one
of
the
party
smoothe
i
suppose
my
ruffled
up
my
play
and
apparently
read
part
with
great
attention
drawing
applause
from
those
who
before
had
laughed
he
read
on
with
so
much
attention
that
the
others
declared
he
had
never
been
so
attentive
before
further
on
it
would
appear
that
this
play
was
named
i
know
nothing
about
it
the
name
cajetan
is
in
italian
gaetano
which
was
the
christian
name
of
polidori
father
i
afterwards
went
out
and
did
a
very
absurd
thing
which
i
told
and
found
i
had
not
only
hurt
myself
but
might
possibly
hurt
others
for
whom
i
cared
much
more
embarked
at
much
hurried
with
three
servants
this
means
to
judge
from
a
published
letter
by
byron
on
the
evening
of
april
the
three
servants
were
berger
a
swiss
william
fletcher
and
robert
rushton
davies
and
hobhouse
it
will
be
understood
remained
ashore
when
at
a
distance
we
waved
our
hands
and
hats
bidding
adieu
the
wind
was
completely
in
our
teeth
but
we
made
the
passage
in
sixteen
hours
the
coast
of
dover
is
very
striking
though
miserably
the
cliff
is
steep
though
not
such
as
shakespear
paints
the
a
distance
which
is
the
only
way
i
viewed
miserable
sailing
from
england
i
for
a
long
time
kept
my
eye
upon
its
stern
white
cliffs
thinking
on
her
who
bade
me
join
her
remembrance
with
the
last
sight
of
my
native
soil
this
points
pretty
clearly
to
a
perhaps
a
matrimonial
engagement
as
a
fact
polidori
never
married
the
lady
may
possibly
have
been
eliza
arrow
a
relative
in
india
with
whom
he
at
a
rather
earlier
date
had
interchanged
various
letters
they
at
last
faded
from
my
sight
and
all
on
board
looked
dreary
the
sea
dashed
over
us
and
all
wore
an
aspect
of
grief
towards
night
a
most
beautiful
spectacle
was
seen
by
myself
who
alone
remained
on
deck
the
stars
shedding
merely
a
twilight
enabled
me
to
see
the
phosphoric
light
of
the
broken
foam
in
all
its
splendour
but
the
most
beautiful
moment
was
that
of
its
first
appearance
no
sound
around
save
the
sullen
rushing
of
the
vessel
and
the
hoarse
cries
of
the
heaving
sailor
no
light
save
a
melancholy
twilight
which
soothed
the
mind
into
forgetfulness
of
its
grief
for
a
beautiful
streak
following
the
lead
through
the
waves
we
arrived
at
ostend
at
in
the
morning
polidori
chronology
is
a
little
confusing
here
if
the
party
left
dover
at
on
april
and
took
sixteen
hours
in
the
they
must
have
reached
ostend
at
in
the
there
is
also
a
confusion
immediately
afterwards
for
he
repeats
the
date
for
which
he
has
already
accounted
viz
passed
through
the
gates
paying
a
franc
a
head
and
went
to
the
cour
impériale
we
were
astonished
at
the
excellent
inn
and
good
treatment
except
that
i
got
a
dreadful
headache
from
the
smell
of
paint
in
my
bedroom
and
that
the
tea
was
perfumed
it
was
i
believe
at
this
point
of
the
narrative
that
my
aunt
charlotte
polidori
cut
out
a
peccant
passage
i
seem
to
remember
the
precise
diction
of
it
which
was
this
as
soon
as
he
reached
his
room
lord
byron
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
upon
the
chambermaid
such
at
any
rate
was
the
substance
of
the
statement
the
other
statement
which
my
aunt
excluded
came
somewhat
further
on
when
polidori
was
staying
near
geneva
he
gave
some
account
of
a
visit
of
his
to
some
haunt
of
the
local
venus
pandemos
i
think
the
police
took
some
notice
of
it
the
performance
was
not
decorous
but
was
related
without
any
verbal
impropriety
arising
in
the
morning
i
went
upon
a
stroll
round
the
town
saw
little
girls
of
all
ages
with
books
in
every
bookseller
window
of
the
most
obscene
nature
women
with
wooden
shoes
men
of
low
rank
basking
in
the
sun
as
if
that
would
evaporate
their
idleness
the
houses
generally
good
old
style
very
like
a
scotch
town
only
not
quite
so
filthy
very
polite
officers
and
very
civil
waiters
fine
room
painted
as
a
panorama
all
went
into
a
shop
where
no
one
spoke
french
tried
german
women
burst
out
laughing
at
me
luckily
for
myself
in
a
good
humour
laughed
with
them
obliged
to
buy
two
books
i
did
not
want
because
i
let
a
quarto
fall
upon
a
fine
girl
head
while
looking
at
her
eyes
coaches
of
the
most
horrid
construction
apparently
some
fine
horses
others
small
fortifications
look
miserable
once
stood
a
fine
siege
when
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
fed
fowls
and
manured
the
fields
what
for
for
religion
money
was
the
spring
of
all
as
long
as
only
religion
and
rights
were
affected
bigoted
religionists
and
wild
republicans
were
alone
concerned
but
a
step
too
far
and
all
was
ruined
the
allusion
here
is
to
the
great
siege
of
ostend
to
we
set
off
at
with
four
horses
postillion
with
boots
to
his
hips
nankeens
leather
hat
with
quaker
brim
only
neatly
rounded
with
black
riband
a
blue
and
red
coat
joined
to
which
a
most
rascally
face
with
lips
that
went
a
few
lines
beyond
the
brim
of
his
hat
a
dreadful
smacker
of
his
whip
and
a
driver
of
four
horses
from
the
back
of
one
of
the
hindermost
we
were
obliged
to
hire
a
calèche
to
send
with
our
luggage
the
rascal
made
us
pay
three
times
too
much
at
each
of
his
barriers
but
after
having
on
account
of
the
horses
not
being
ready
at
the
next
post
gone
beyond
his
beat
he
allowed
the
to
be
honest
and
only
take
a
few
centimes
instead
of
a
franc
the
country
very
flat
highly
cultivated
sand
no
waste
roads
paved
in
the
middle
with
trees
on
each
side
country
from
the
interspersion
of
houses
spires
cottages
delightful
everything
comfortable
no
appearance
of
discontent
we
got
out
of
our
carriage
at
a
place
where
the
horses
ate
bread
and
hay
and
walked
on
to
a
where
we
found
no
tombstones
no
no
flattering
eulogy
but
simply
a
wooden
cross
at
each
grave
head
and
foot
on
the
side
of
the
at
a
little
height
was
made
a
niche
wherein
statues
formed
a
crucifixion
as
an
object
to
excite
reverence
and
adoration
of
god
in
every
passenger
we
passed
on
and
arrived
at
bruges
at
the
fall
of
the
evening
our
passports
were
dispensed
with
on
our
mentioning
that
we
were
not
stopping
we
entered
one
of
the
most
beautiful
towns
i
ever
saw
every
house
seemed
some
ornament
either
of
fretwork
or
seem
clean
and
neat
we
stopped
at
the
post
we
were
shown
into
the
postmaster
parlour
on
our
asking
for
something
to
even
than
a
common
middleman
house
in
london
francs
for
a
bottle
of
rhenish
women
generally
pretty
flemish
face
has
no
pleasing
more
than
sparkling
eye
in
a
full
round
their
pictures
of
every
age
have
the
mark
of
their
country
as
we
went
from
bruges
twilight
softened
all
the
beauty
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
describe
the
feeling
of
pleasure
we
felt
in
going
through
its
long
streets
bursting
on
to
spots
where
people
were
promenading
amidst
short
avenues
of
trees
we
passed
on
at
the
gates
i
saw
a
boy
with
sand
in
his
hand
let
it
through
his
fingers
laughingly
heedless
of
the
myriads
whose
life
hung
upon
each
sand
we
passed
on
at
we
came
to
a
village
where
we
heard
the
sound
of
music
the
innkeeper
on
our
enquiring
what
it
was
asked
us
politely
in
to
hear
a
concert
of
amateurs
we
descended
and
were
gratified
and
surprised
at
hearing
in
a
village
of
souls
a
full
band
playing
difficult
though
beautiful
music
one
march
particularly
struck
us
but
what
was
our
surprise
when
the
door
opened
to
view
the
group
none
apparently
above
the
rank
of
labourers
yet
they
met
three
times
a
week
in
our
country
the
amusement
is
to
reel
drunk
as
many
there
was
one
figure
manifestly
consumptive
yet
he
was
blowing
an
enormous
trombone
within
a
few
miles
of
gand
i
was
wakened
from
a
pleasant
fireside
in
england
by
my
companion
saying
they
have
lost
their
way
and
seeing
a
house
near
me
i
jumped
out
to
enquire
when
to
my
great
fear
i
saw
it
was
deserted
i
immediately
suspected
something
and
went
back
for
a
pistol
and
then
thundered
at
the
door
no
one
came
looking
round
i
saw
other
houses
towards
which
upon
my
moving
the
postillion
got
off
and
telling
me
in
french
as
a
consolation
that
he
could
not
understand
it
went
with
me
towards
a
house
where
there
was
light
and
suddenly
ran
off
i
immediately
went
to
the
carriage
and
we
gave
sabres
to
the
servants
when
he
ran
back
from
out
of
sight
and
knocked
again
at
the
door
and
roused
two
who
told
us
the
way
by
the
by
we
had
crossed
several
times
the
bridge
and
from
the
road
and
back
again
whereas
we
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
straight
on
instead
of
which
he
crossed
over
and
was
going
back
in
the
direction
of
bruges
when
our
servant
stopped
him
i
can
not
explain
his
conduct
he
was
dreadfully
frightened
we
arrived
at
ghent
at
in
the
morning
and
knocked
some
time
at
the
gates
but
at
last
by
means
of
a
few
francs
got
not
asked
for
got
to
the
hôtel
des
pays
bas
where
count
artois
resided
while
at
ghent
we
were
ushered
into
a
splendid
room
got
excellent
rhenish
butter
cheese
and
went
to
bed
gand
charles
the
ist
of
spain
was
born
it
was
here
he
really
showed
the
insufficiency
of
ambition
and
all
the
joys
of
manhood
after
having
at
brussels
resigned
to
philip
his
extensive
dominions
he
came
here
and
enjoyed
many
days
while
passing
over
the
scenes
of
his
youth
which
neither
the
splendour
attached
to
a
european
or
an
indian
crown
nor
to
the
conquests
of
his
powerful
and
noble
views
could
efface
he
did
not
seek
pavia
no
it
was
at
gand
that
he
sought
for
his
last
draught
of
worldly
joy
the
town
was
worthy
of
it
if
beauty
and
antiquity
if
riches
and
liberty
with
all
their
train
could
render
it
worthy
of
him
this
town
has
all
the
beauty
of
bruges
but
more
extensive
finer
houses
perhaps
fine
cathedral
fine
paintings
fine
streets
fine
canal
the
streets
are
perhaps
the
finest
i
have
seen
not
so
unpleasantly
regular
as
london
not
so
high
but
more
rich
in
outside
we
visited
the
cathedral
and
after
having
been
accustomed
to
the
tinselly
ornaments
of
our
catholic
chapels
and
the
complete
want
of
any
in
the
scotch
and
english
churches
we
were
much
pleased
with
the
cathedral
inside
dress
paintings
that
were
by
the
hand
of
masters
the
fortune
of
a
bishop
expended
in
building
the
part
near
the
altar
in
marble
and
statues
not
contemptible
united
with
the
airy
high
fretted
roof
and
little
light
impressive
of
awe
under
this
cathedral
is
the
first
belgian
church
that
was
built
in
the
reign
of
charlemagne
years
i
think
after
christ
it
is
but
so
strong
it
bears
the
weight
of
the
cathedral
upon
it
there
were
several
paintings
preserved
in
it
before
the
date
of
where
the
colours
are
mixed
with
white
of
egg
some
curious
tombs
where
the
different
styles
are
evident
in
the
earliest
tomb
some
of
the
draperies
on
the
relief
are
in
a
bold
fine
style
one
of
the
earliest
has
a
bishop
where
all
his
robes
are
carved
out
with
almost
the
threads
of
his
vest
others
however
are
for
general
effect
we
mounted
steps
to
the
top
of
the
steeple
whence
we
saw
a
complete
horizon
of
plain
canals
intersecting
trees
and
houses
and
steeples
thrown
here
and
there
with
gand
below
at
our
feet
the
sea
at
a
distance
bound
by
the
hands
of
man
which
pointed
so
far
shall
ye
go
and
no
farther
bruges
held
in
the
horizon
its
steeples
to
our
view
and
many
hamlets
raised
from
out
their
surrounding
wood
their
single
spires
to
sight
treading
again
the
stairs
we
came
into
the
street
and
mounting
into
a
fiacre
we
went
to
the
ecole
de
dessin
where
we
found
a
gallery
of
paintings
with
two
students
unmoved
by
the
visitors
around
painting
with
the
patience
if
not
the
genius
of
dutch
masters
they
were
rather
a
nuisance
on
the
present
occasion
as
one
covered
with
his
machine
a
of
rubens
the
roch
amongst
the
sick
of
the
there
were
two
more
by
the
same
of
roch
and
his
dog
etc
they
were
in
a
different
style
of
and
grey
none
of
his
gay
draperies
that
i
no
connoisseur
thought
were
constituents
of
rubens
i
do
not
remember
whose
picture
that
struck
me
much
beheading
of
where
all
the
interest
and
beauty
consisted
in
a
dog
smelling
the
dead
body
there
were
two
of
van
eyck
the
first
according
to
the
flemish
who
invented
painting
in
oil
where
the
colouring
was
splendid
and
very
like
the
stiffness
of
glass
but
the
faces
were
very
good
kruger
had
many
here
in
honour
of
charles
the
vth
amongst
the
others
one
rather
though
probably
not
meant
as
such
satirical
charles
landing
takes
hold
of
dame
africa
who
quietly
points
to
a
lion
at
her
feet
drive
him
away
there
was
a
of
by
the
same
where
the
child
was
painted
dead
with
most
perfect
nature
so
much
so
that
my
companion
who
is
a
father
could
not
bear
its
sight
teniers
has
here
a
of
strange
a
satire
if
mere
deceit
is
the
acme
of
perfection
some
dutchmen
may
snatch
the
palm
from
either
apelles
or
parrhasius
they
paint
boards
with
an
engraving
upon
them
or
a
door
or
aught
else
so
inimitably
that
it
deceived
my
friend
we
went
into
the
academy
of
casts
of
design
etc
there
are
generally
pupils
in
this
town
many
fall
off
annually
without
great
advancement
and
are
trod
on
the
heels
by
others
we
thence
proceeded
to
another
we
might
say
cathedral
the
steeple
is
not
yet
finished
the
model
is
exhibited
with
the
curses
of
the
flemish
exhibitors
upon
the
grande
nation
for
having
taken
the
funds
for
its
finishing
there
are
more
good
pictures
than
even
in
the
cathedral
the
columns
also
please
me
more
being
round
with
a
gothic
approach
to
corinthian
capital
the
most
beautiful
painting
i
have
yet
seen
is
here
though
i
probably
shall
not
be
held
out
in
my
opinion
by
connoisseurs
pollent
representing
the
trial
of
the
true
cross
upon
a
sick
lady
the
harmony
of
colouring
the
soberness
without
the
commonly
accompanying
dulness
of
the
colouring
the
good
design
and
grouping
are
in
my
opinion
beautiful
not
even
the
splendid
colouring
of
rubens
can
make
his
pictures
in
my
eyes
equal
to
it
i
do
not
know
who
is
the
painter
termed
pollent
by
polidori
on
there
is
the
name
polenck
which
may
designate
the
same
painter
neither
of
these
names
can
be
traced
by
me
in
a
catalogue
of
pictures
in
the
museum
of
antwerp
there
is
one
standing
by
it
of
vandyck
which
has
some
sublimity
in
it
perhaps
arising
from
indistinctness
it
represents
the
effect
of
christ
last
sigh
by
this
altar
stood
twelve
small
pictures
hung
out
at
this
time
for
people
to
tread
the
way
of
calvary
representing
the
different
stages
of
our
saviour
sufferings
there
were
many
more
pictures
but
i
can
not
remember
seeing
so
many
crowded
in
the
gallery
put
others
out
of
my
head
but
there
were
painted
in
the
cathedral
of
bavon
on
the
marble
in
the
style
of
reliefs
different
subjects
of
scripture
in
a
most
masterly
style
and
so
well
were
the
shades
managed
that
we
could
hardly
believe
the
cicerone
when
he
assured
us
they
were
paintings
in
the
gallery
of
casts
there
were
the
statues
of
two
english
ladies
of
london
by
an
artist
who
resided
thirty
years
there
and
upon
his
return
bestowed
these
as
his
finest
works
the
faces
though
not
perfect
or
grecian
i
must
say
for
my
countrywomen
pleased
me
almost
as
much
as
any
venus
de
medici
i
have
found
the
people
polite
so
far
as
showing
the
way
and
then
not
waiting
for
a
off
their
hats
as
if
had
done
them
the
favour
set
off
at
this
morning
to
go
to
anvers
but
after
having
proceeded
some
way
one
of
the
wheels
refused
to
turn
and
after
at
the
next
village
hammering
a
long
while
i
rode
off
in
a
passing
calèche
to
ghent
where
i
put
a
maréchal
with
his
assistant
into
a
voiture
and
mounting
myself
on
horseback
returned
to
the
coach
my
horse
was
particularly
fond
of
the
shade
and
a
house
being
near
one
of
the
barriers
he
kindly
stopped
there
to
cool
me
i
after
waiting
some
time
began
to
press
him
to
go
forward
when
he
kicked
etc
we
went
while
the
carriage
was
being
repaired
into
a
cottage
where
all
was
extremely
neat
and
we
saw
two
pictures
in
it
that
certainly
would
not
shame
the
collection
of
many
of
our
cognoscenti
the
old
man
was
sick
of
a
fever
and
upon
giving
him
medicine
his
kind
half
sympathetically
fell
ill
of
a
toothache
never
did
i
see
such
chips
of
the
old
block
as
his
two
daughters
they
were
very
kind
it
being
sunday
we
saw
all
the
women
of
the
ugly
indeed
i
have
not
seen
a
pretty
woman
since
i
left
ostend
this
reference
to
april
as
being
a
sunday
puts
a
stop
to
any
preceding
question
as
to
the
right
day
of
the
month
for
in
fact
april
a
sunday
on
proceeding
on
our
journey
we
were
stopped
for
our
passports
and
the
fellow
began
bullying
us
thinking
we
were
french
but
when
he
heard
we
were
english
he
became
cap
in
hand
and
let
us
go
indeed
we
have
not
yet
shown
our
passports
having
eaten
i
issued
forth
in
search
of
the
promenade
and
found
the
canal
with
walks
called
la
copeure
many
ladies
all
ugly
without
only
pretty
woman
being
fat
and
sixty
it
very
much
resembled
the
green
basin
where
our
cits
trot
on
one
heels
with
all
possible
care
not
quite
so
crowded
coming
back
i
tourized
to
the
roi
where
as
in
a
coffeehouse
i
found
a
room
full
of
disreputable
women
and
this
instead
of
the
streets
is
the
lounge
for
such
women
i
went
to
the
café
grand
where
by
means
of
mirrors
some
excellent
effects
are
produced
there
also
were
billiards
cards
dice
etc
a
cup
of
coffee
some
centimes
a
glass
of
lemonade
two
sous
a
woman
presides
at
the
end
of
the
room
lord
byron
was
in
the
lord
byron
encouraged
me
to
write
and
to
continue
being
a
tragedian
murray
offered
for
two
plays
and
for
my
tour
from
my
window
i
saw
a
native
dashing
about
in
a
barouche
and
four
there
is
in
the
town
a
society
of
nobles
and
another
of
literati
scamp
has
a
fine
collection
of
pictures
which
i
did
not
see
in
ghent
as
well
as
in
all
other
places
where
i
have
been
the
barber
sign
is
mambrino
helm
on
the
sunday
mornings
there
is
a
market
for
flowers
in
pot
in
the
place
des
armes
we
set
off
at
in
the
morning
and
passed
through
some
fine
villages
one
of
which
nicholas
the
mistress
of
the
inn
told
me
buonaparte
made
into
a
mais
il
a
pas
des
postes
the
country
is
tiresomely
beautiful
fine
avenues
which
make
us
yawn
with
admiration
not
a
single
variation
no
rising
one
spot
raised
for
a
windmill
the
landscape
is
as
unchangeable
as
the
flemish
face
the
houses
with
a
row
of
trees
before
them
the
roofs
tiled
and
the
windows
large
indeed
the
appearance
of
comfort
in
the
places
we
have
passed
through
is
much
greater
than
any
i
have
seen
in
england
we
have
only
seen
one
and
that
very
english
its
pasture
had
the
only
firs
we
have
yet
seen
the
avenues
are
sometimes
terminated
by
a
church
or
a
church
very
ugly
and
both
very
tiresome
as
they
always
prove
much
farther
off
than
is
at
first
expected
the
ground
cultivated
and
without
a
waste
ground
the
plough
moves
as
if
cutting
water
the
soil
is
so
light
a
sand
women
work
in
the
fields
as
well
as
men
no
more
difference
is
found
in
the
face
of
the
inhabitants
than
in
the
face
of
the
country
nothing
striking
all
evenness
no
genius
much
stupidity
they
seemed
to
spend
all
their
fund
of
cleanliness
upon
their
fields
and
houses
for
they
carry
none
about
them
an
oldish
man
wears
a
cocked
hat
capacious
breeches
black
or
blue
stockings
buckles
and
a
young
fancy
the
women
wear
enormous
gold
earrings
large
wooden
shoes
their
dress
is
a
kind
of
like
the
scotch
young
girls
of
eight
in
town
have
their
hair
dressed
with
a
net
or
cap
in
towns
and
villages
the
better
wear
a
black
silk
mantle
with
a
hood
that
looks
well
multitudes
of
children
everywhere
who
tumble
and
run
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
to
gain
a
few
centimes
in
the
larger
villages
the
are
splendidly
large
with
a
little
square
place
in
the
middle
with
pollards
and
a
statue
the
houses
seem
comfortable
everywhere
going
into
the
house
of
a
postmaster
we
saw
some
english
prints
at
another
our
servants
having
got
down
and
comfortably
seated
themselves
to
a
bottle
of
wine
the
postmistress
on
our
getting
out
took
for
the
servants
and
told
us
the
messieurs
anglais
were
in
yon
room
then
made
us
a
thousand
apologies
at
every
posthorse
place
there
is
kept
a
book
of
the
posts
many
mile
at
gand
they
had
told
us
we
could
not
reach
anvers
without
passing
the
scheldt
at
passed
it
at
the
town
of
antwerp
makes
a
good
figure
at
a
distance
chiefly
on
account
of
its
cathedral
which
has
a
very
airy
appearance
the
steeple
showing
the
sky
between
its
meeting
arches
about
five
steeples
the
fortifications
which
enabled
carnot
to
make
such
a
defence
produce
no
great
effect
on
the
sight
the
defence
by
carnot
was
when
polidori
wrote
a
quite
recent
event
the
scheldt
is
a
fine
river
not
so
large
as
our
thames
and
covered
with
ugly
dutch
vessels
we
passed
our
coach
in
a
boat
this
coach
was
a
formidable
affair
according
to
pryse
lockhart
gordon
it
was
copied
from
the
celebrated
one
of
napoleon
taken
at
genappe
with
additions
besides
a
de
it
contained
a
library
a
and
every
apparatus
for
dining
on
landing
twenty
porters
ran
off
with
our
things
to
a
cart
as
they
were
passing
one
in
all
the
pomp
of
office
stopped
us
and
asked
for
our
passports
which
on
handing
to
him
he
detained
giving
his
directions
to
the
police
the
older
parts
of
antwerp
have
a
novel
and
strange
effect
by
the
being
all
to
the
street
acute
angles
the
place
de
meer
is
fine
the
old
street
the
finest
i
ever
saw
has
some
fine
houses
many
of
the
houses
have
english
labels
on
them
in
our
are
two
beds
indeed
the
towns
are
beautiful
their
long
streets
their
houses
all
or
with
strange
fronts
the
frequent
canals
the
large
places
and
venerable
cathedrals
their
places
are
much
finer
than
our
squares
for
they
contain
trees
and
are
open
without
railing
went
to
the
café
and
saw
all
playing
at
dominoes
read
till
the
fine
furniture
everywhere
of
at
gand
in
the
cathedral
the
cicerone
laid
great
stress
on
the
being
all
made
of
solid
acajou
the
master
of
the
inn
at
ghent
assures
me
the
carriage
of
buonaparte
was
made
in
at
brussels
no
english
work
plenty
of
americans
in
the
town
up
late
and
went
to
look
at
the
carriage
and
found
that
the
back
had
been
not
of
the
called
a
maréchal
who
assured
me
it
could
not
be
better
breakfasted
then
looked
at
an
old
calèche
for
which
asked
naps
refused
it
got
with
a
guide
a
calèche
to
see
the
lions
the
town
is
large
apparently
not
a
proportionable
quantity
of
misery
women
at
all
the
fountains
upon
all
the
corners
of
the
streets
with
lamps
before
them
lamps
with
reverberators
strung
on
ropes
into
the
middle
of
the
streets
went
to
the
cathedral
everywhere
we
have
been
dreadful
complaints
of
french
vandalism
in
this
chapel
it
has
been
shameless
once
crowded
with
altars
of
marble
now
there
are
about
two
marble
the
others
painted
in
imitation
pictures
were
sold
by
one
saved
bought
by
a
barber
for
a
louis
the
others
with
all
the
tombs
monuments
everything
broken
by
these
encouragers
of
the
fine
arts
so
great
was
the
ruin
that
there
were
five
feet
of
fragments
over
the
the
columns
that
support
the
roof
were
so
much
defaced
that
they
were
obliged
in
restoring
it
to
pare
them
all
much
thinner
some
pictures
were
carried
to
paris
of
which
some
are
now
about
to
be
replaced
it
was
the
feast
of
anthony
and
many
candles
were
burning
about
and
some
relics
were
fixed
above
the
doors
in
many
parts
of
the
chapel
were
frames
containing
silver
representations
very
small
of
bad
limbs
offered
by
the
devout
many
images
over
altars
dressed
out
in
silk
and
taffeta
most
common
one
the
virgin
mary
though
the
french
acted
with
all
the
spirit
of
vandals
and
true
gauls
yet
to
their
very
mischief
is
owing
the
greatest
beauty
of
the
cathedral
the
choir
not
being
divided
from
the
church
so
that
from
one
end
to
the
other
there
is
a
complete
perspective
and
one
of
the
finest
effects
i
have
seen
the
airiness
and
length
being
now
proportionate
there
is
one
great
defect
in
the
internal
they
are
greek
what
bad
taste
it
is
to
ornament
gothic
with
corinthian
columns
must
be
evident
to
make
it
also
more
glaring
the
marble
is
all
coloured
there
is
here
a
fine
marble
indeed
in
all
the
churches
we
have
here
seen
they
are
where
boys
called
in
italian
puttini
are
sculptured
the
confessionals
are
of
wood
with
evangelical
figures
nearly
as
large
as
life
between
each
badly
carved
we
went
to
see
another
church
wherein
is
the
tomb
of
rubens
this
is
the
church
of
st
jâques
it
is
in
a
chapel
by
itself
where
annually
a
mass
is
said
for
his
soul
it
is
worthy
of
him
ornamented
by
a
painting
by
himself
of
george
and
a
statue
he
brought
with
him
from
rome
of
the
holy
virgin
the
church
in
which
he
is
buried
was
saved
from
pillage
by
the
priests
belonging
to
it
revolutionizing
it
is
crowded
with
altars
and
rubens
some
polenck
and
others
there
is
a
painting
by
metsys
who
originally
was
a
maréchal
and
who
with
his
mere
hammer
formed
the
decorations
to
a
pump
which
are
not
bad
the
latin
inscription
on
his
monumental
stone
refers
to
a
story
related
of
him
that
upon
courting
the
daughter
of
francis
floris
the
artist
with
indignation
talked
about
the
dirty
rascal
impudence
he
being
merely
a
blacksmith
on
which
metsys
set
off
for
rome
and
upon
his
return
asked
the
daughter
to
introduce
him
to
her
father
room
of
painting
where
finding
a
picture
not
finished
he
painted
a
excited
the
indignation
of
floris
and
gained
him
his
daughter
i
have
seen
the
picture
and
it
might
be
true
the
pump
is
not
bad
being
merely
beaten
into
shape
on
the
top
is
a
giant
who
used
to
cut
off
merchants
gains
by
means
of
tolls
and
their
hands
by
means
of
axes
he
used
to
throw
an
iron
band
into
the
scales
of
his
tradesmen
and
from
thence
is
said
antwerp
got
its
name
this
may
be
said
but
a
less
legendary
derivation
of
the
flemish
name
antwerpen
is
aent
werf
or
on
the
wharf
the
sides
of
this
church
all
along
are
lined
with
confessionals
in
the
church
des
augustins
we
saw
rubens
of
the
from
paris
where
he
has
shown
how
weak
he
could
be
in
composition
and
in
it
is
the
third
picture
in
which
he
has
put
himself
in
george
armour
the
composition
is
confused
without
an
object
to
fix
the
attention
a
vandyck
near
him
is
much
superior
polidori
observations
about
flemish
paintings
are
generally
indicative
of
liking
more
or
less
but
byron
went
dead
against
them
in
a
letter
of
his
to
his
leigh
written
from
brussels
on
may
we
find
as
for
churches
and
pictures
i
have
stared
at
them
till
my
brains
are
like
a
the
last
though
it
is
heresy
to
say
so
do
please
me
at
all
i
think
rubens
a
very
great
dauber
and
prefer
vandyck
a
hundred
times
then
i
know
nothing
about
the
matter
rubens
women
have
all
red
gowns
and
red
shoulders
to
say
nothing
of
necks
of
which
they
are
more
liberal
than
charming
it
may
all
be
very
fine
and
i
suppose
it
may
be
art
for
is
not
nature
again
in
a
letter
to
john
murray
from
milan
october
the
flemish
school
such
as
i
saw
it
in
flanders
i
utterly
detested
despised
and
abhorred
here
is
also
the
famous
picture
of
jordaens
of
martyrdom
of
colouring
approaches
rubens
but
abominable
large
numerous
figures
in
a
small
space
there
were
some
modern
paintings
of
existing
in
the
musée
we
saw
many
rubenses
the
famous
from
the
the
effect
of
the
white
sheet
is
wonderfully
beautiful
drawing
i
do
not
like
the
christ
seems
not
dead
as
there
is
certainly
action
but
the
colouring
is
splendidly
rich
the
near
it
inferior
in
all
in
a
sketch
near
it
he
has
not
succeeded
so
well
in
the
white
sheet
it
being
not
so
splendidly
white
we
could
only
see
the
of
the
great
as
the
large
piece
was
being
framed
in
these
there
is
much
caricature
drawing
a
woman
rising
from
the
a
woman
large
as
guy
warwick
giant
wife
if
ever
he
had
one
caricature
physiognomies
and
most
hellish
egregious
breasts
which
a
child
refuses
with
horror
in
its
face
his
horses
have
much
flemish
size
indeed
divest
rubens
of
his
rich
apparel
and
he
is
a
mere
dauber
in
design
there
is
a
going
to
looking
more
like
a
cardinal
indeed
my
companion
lord
byron
took
her
for
one
of
the
nobles
no
divinity
about
his
christs
putrefaction
upon
his
gods
exaggerated
passion
about
his
men
and
women
painted
not
in
his
picture
of
adoration
of
the
query
did
he
not
intend
to
play
upon
the
people
by
passing
off
a
caricature
for
a
religious
painting
the
royal
personage
in
green
seems
as
if
his
eyes
had
grown
big
after
dinner
he
has
no
costume
properly
applied
the
virgin
in
the
manger
is
dressed
meretriciously
in
silks
and
lace
then
look
at
our
blessed
saviour
showing
his
wounds
his
finest
painting
is
his
in
which
is
the
white
sheet
but
there
are
defects
what
then
must
be
the
power
of
colouring
which
causes
you
to
view
his
paintings
with
pleasure
it
is
like
melodious
music
which
makes
you
forget
the
absurd
words
of
an
old
english
song
vandyck
in
my
opinion
was
much
superior
to
rubens
his
colouring
near
his
is
sombre
but
then
his
design
is
more
perfect
his
impressions
remain
longer
in
the
mind
distinct
and
do
not
fade
away
into
ideas
of
red
and
blue
round
white
a
little
of
his
is
worth
his
rival
largest
paintings
his
is
beautiful
wherein
are
contained
the
blessed
virgin
mary
magdalene
and
john
weeping
the
different
expressions
of
grief
the
unison
of
colouring
with
the
subject
the
composition
all
excellent
from
the
cathedral
we
went
to
see
the
works
of
napoleon
we
first
saw
the
basins
they
are
not
so
large
as
our
west
india
are
capable
of
holding
ships
of
the
line
there
are
two
between
them
is
what
was
formerly
the
hanseatic
hall
now
magazines
when
the
english
were
last
here
they
threw
bombs
but
this
was
of
no
avail
dung
was
put
upon
the
ships
and
men
were
at
hand
in
case
of
fire
from
the
basins
we
went
along
the
long
along
the
labouring
scheldt
then
into
the
places
for
marine
arsenals
where
the
vessels
were
on
the
finest
works
i
ever
saw
now
useless
through
our
jealousy
the
quite
finished
is
enormously
long
and
is
to
be
pulled
down
the
timbers
for
the
ship
were
numbered
and
carried
to
amsterdam
the
citadel
was
though
so
strong
the
chief
batteries
are
as
old
as
alva
was
one
pointed
out
as
erected
by
colonel
crawford
before
napoleon
time
there
was
little
done
towards
the
formation
of
these
basins
and
others
but
said
our
guide
he
decreed
they
should
be
made
and
they
appeared
they
are
all
surrounded
with
high
walls
to
hinder
the
escape
of
the
employed
carnot
has
commanded
here
twice
he
was
rather
disliked
yet
they
had
rather
have
him
than
any
other
they
all
agree
in
his
genius
in
the
time
of
the
walcheren
business
the
english
were
expected
with
open
arms
only
three
hundred
was
general
the
siege
was
not
very
strict
on
the
last
occasion
and
no
mischief
was
done
on
either
side
in
the
basins
there
have
been
line
in
the
dread
of
a
siege
all
the
suburbs
were
destroyed
and
all
the
trees
around
the
suburbs
rose
immediately
the
trees
in
years
in
the
citadel
there
are
forçats
sometimes
the
number
exceeds
having
seen
thus
much
we
returned
lunched
and
rode
off
hardly
gone
a
little
way
when
our
carriage
broke
down
the
trees
are
more
more
inequality
of
apparent
villas
some
clipped
like
large
villages
carriage
broke
to
there
at
ten
women
improve
at
antwerp
in
one
church
on
the
outside
saw
a
supposed
exact
imitation
of
the
sepulchre
though
i
do
not
know
how
it
came
seated
in
purgatory
as
there
certainly
is
a
place
so
called
round
it
full
of
the
damned
and
flames
the
place
is
within
there
is
a
representation
of
our
lord
swathed
in
linen
all
over
there
are
statues
so
so
david
is
at
a
respectable
distance
from
purgatory
this
makes
it
the
more
remarkable
that
the
sepulchre
is
seated
in
purgatory
indeed
indeed
there
is
much
absurdity
there
is
an
academy
for
drawing
and
painting
with
a
museum
the
place
is
in
a
garden
on
arriving
at
malines
we
found
pradt
gone
from
his
bishopric
amongst
his
brethren
and
we
are
assured
he
was
a
vraiment
français
and
that
he
was
not
a
catholique
and
that
this
town
wanted
a
vraiment
catholique
the
abbé
de
pradt
born
in
auvergne
in
had
been
a
champion
of
the
monarchy
in
the
constituent
assembly
of
napoleon
made
him
archbishop
of
malines
towards
but
afterwards
viewed
him
with
disfavour
he
resigned
the
archbishopric
in
receiving
a
pension
he
wrote
a
number
of
books
on
political
and
public
matters
and
died
in
the
country
from
antwerp
to
malines
becomes
more
and
more
like
england
trees
more
various
not
the
same
dead
flat
but
varied
with
gentle
swells
many
pollards
and
more
miserable
cottages
there
is
in
the
cathedral
in
antwerp
a
painting
by
one
on
which
is
the
he
has
shown
great
imagination
and
fire
in
the
devils
it
is
the
victory
of
the
angels
when
fighting
against
the
devils
soon
as
up
i
went
to
the
cathedral
which
has
a
fine
tower
on
entering
i
saw
many
pictures
none
that
i
saw
seemed
particularly
good
the
church
was
pretty
full
of
people
who
really
seemed
devout
they
were
not
the
old
and
weak
but
there
was
of
every
age
the
young
maiden
was
seen
by
the
side
of
decrepit
age
beauty
by
deformity
childhood
by
manhood
the
effect
on
the
mind
is
contagious
many
masses
were
going
on
at
the
same
time
a
woman
went
round
for
money
for
the
chairs
here
i
saw
the
first
christian
caryatides
we
soon
set
off
for
brussels
between
and
that
town
the
road
is
beautiful
a
canal
on
one
side
fine
trees
forming
a
long
avenue
diversified
with
glimpses
of
a
rich
country
we
passed
the
castle
of
lac
the
former
residence
of
buonaparte
it
has
a
fine
front
upon
an
eminence
but
the
dome
stands
forth
in
glaring
ugliness
we
entered
brussels
by
the
allée
verte
a
fine
promenade
brussels
the
old
town
is
not
so
fine
as
antwerp
ghent
or
bruges
the
grand
marché
is
very
beautiful
only
the
buildings
seem
to
be
neglected
fine
public
offices
with
a
tall
spire
on
one
mairie
opposite
the
place
royale
is
very
fine
the
fronts
of
the
houses
and
hotels
around
seeming
together
to
form
parts
of
one
great
palace
and
the
church
on
one
side
with
the
housy
wings
has
a
fine
effect
in
spite
of
the
ugly
tower
at
the
top
the
gardens
are
beautiful
with
green
and
well
laid
out
in
walks
with
groups
and
palace
opposite
the
entrance
from
the
place
royale
presents
a
fine
front
and
the
suburbs
round
it
are
also
good
we
are
at
the
hôtel
saw
which
are
again
dutysied
brussels
was
not
at
all
fortified
in
the
waterloo
time
the
germans
at
one
time
had
retreated
as
far
as
the
gates
which
were
obliged
to
be
shut
against
them
in
case
of
a
retreat
there
would
have
been
a
pleasant
rush
almost
as
great
as
at
a
fashionable
rout
as
they
must
all
have
passed
through
brussels
the
carriage
was
put
under
hand
crowds
of
english
have
seen
many
many
soldiers
no
wonder
they
were
light
of
foot
when
not
more
heavy
of
age
for
none
have
beards
yet
except
some
few
cavalry
the
english
women
are
the
only
women
in
brussels
though
with
true
english
bullism
they
vest
a
complete
anglomanian
costume
preserving
their
french
fashions
for
the
english
winds
to
waft
the
women
of
brabant
and
the
netherlands
are
all
ugly
to
the
eye
after
the
piquant
begins
to
pall
for
there
are
no
regular
beauties
or
beauty
of
expression
except
that
levity
which
tells
of
lightness
of
cares
and
youth
it
is
not
for
a
foreigner
to
call
a
thing
absurd
because
it
does
not
tally
with
his
ideas
or
the
ladies
costume
except
the
black
mantle
should
be
put
down
as
such
by
me
the
men
also
are
short
and
either
consummate
impudence
or
complete
individuality
the
indelicacy
of
these
belgians
is
gross
all
kinds
of
disgusting
books
publicly
sold
and
exposed
to
the
eyes
of
all
young
publicly
exhibited
on
the
public
with
men
vomiting
with
effort
a
stream
of
still
worse
the
town
brussels
is
situated
on
an
eminence
and
is
really
poor
in
comparison
of
the
other
belgic
towns
by
us
seen
after
dinner
having
dressed
i
went
having
written
two
letters
to
the
theatre
mounting
a
voiture
i
was
soon
there
ascending
some
stairs
i
came
to
a
door
where
after
some
knocking
a
man
took
my
money
and
gave
me
tickets
which
changed
twice
brought
me
to
the
first
row
of
boxes
the
first
look
at
the
lobbies
was
sufficient
to
give
me
an
idea
of
all
the
misery
misery
wherever
one
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
to
the
wall
to
the
all
garret
of
the
giles
style
most
of
the
doors
had
written
on
them
i
got
into
one
and
what
a
sight
boxes
dirty
with
filth
one
chandelier
was
sufficient
for
the
pockets
of
a
brussels
manager
hung
from
the
middle
pit
divided
into
two
parts
of
different
prices
boxes
into
three
and
a
gallery
chairs
not
benches
in
the
boxes
ladies
came
and
sat
and
talked
and
talked
and
sat
and
stood
and
went
away
many
english
ladies
orchestra
violins
seven
in
all
curtain
farce
did
not
make
me
laugh
how
call
that
a
theatrical
amusement
which
only
seems
fitted
to
excite
the
pleasurable
sensation
of
yawning
it
was
french
an
actress
the
best
amongst
them
spoke
french
like
a
base
pig
another
contorted
the
fine
lady
into
one
with
a
paralytic
stroke
after
sitting
up
at
cards
the
gentlemen
like
and
high
life
was
copied
from
the
of
butchers
ladies
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
applause
that
a
lady
actress
gained
it
moved
me
astonishingly
not
her
acting
but
the
acting
pleasure
at
last
came
the
wind
whistling
through
the
reeds
the
cheeks
and
lashing
hands
to
my
great
admiration
it
moved
phlegm
one
who
was
to
act
blondel
was
vomiting
at
home
i
went
behind
the
scenes
and
saw
dismay
in
every
face
and
terror
in
every
limb
the
curtain
drew
up
and
the
play
began
hisses
hisses
hisses
it
fell
and
fear
increased
some
time
was
spent
in
cogitation
the
venturous
hero
advanced
retired
was
rebuked
by
the
police
and
forced
to
advance
hisses
he
said
to
the
audience
he
was
forced
to
advance
they
listened
and
quiproquos
commenced
between
the
players
and
the
audience
with
the
sonorous
hiss
of
anger
the
police
saw
all
was
in
vain
and
ordered
the
actors
off
the
boards
i
in
the
meantime
was
chatting
with
two
apparent
goddesses
who
very
concisely
explained
the
trembling
of
the
actors
by
telling
me
of
real
showers
of
eggs
etc
as
i
left
the
house
i
heard
groans
and
hollow
sounds
and
cries
of
give
me
back
my
money
i
am
an
and
have
seen
nothing
i
and
the
police
pushing
on
the
mob
pushing
us
back
etc
going
along
the
lobbies
what
was
my
wonder
to
stumble
on
a
bookseller
shop
where
was
an
assemblage
of
delicacies
fit
for
the
modest
and
wondrous
delicate
saw
in
the
street
three
dogs
of
the
bulldog
race
dragging
up
a
hill
at
a
good
pace
what
i
am
sure
two
men
would
not
have
strength
to
drag
i
saw
also
a
goat
fastened
to
a
child
car
i
went
all
over
the
town
for
a
one
for
louis
in
the
evening
having
procured
redingotes
which
i
did
not
use
we
mounted
a
coach
and
drove
to
returned
home
ate
and
slept
risen
foolishly
paid
naps
to
the
coachmaker
my
lord
and
servant
stepped
into
the
calèche
i
and
a
servant
got
on
horseback
and
went
to
waterloo
we
soon
entered
soignies
which
on
both
sides
formed
a
beautiful
wood
not
forest
for
it
was
not
wild
on
either
side
for
several
miles
the
avenue
it
formed
varied
in
length
sometimes
the
end
was
formed
by
a
turn
of
the
road
sometimes
by
the
mere
perspective
effect
of
narrowing
the
trees
are
all
of
above
thirty
years
growth
we
then
reached
waterloo
where
were
the
of
napoleon
an
officious
host
pressed
us
to
order
dinner
we
ran
from
his
pressing
and
advancing
came
to
jean
where
the
boys
continued
the
offerings
we
first
had
at
waterloo
of
buttons
books
etc
this
was
the
village
which
gave
the
french
name
to
the
battle
i
believe
as
it
was
the
spot
which
napoleon
tried
to
gain
the
view
of
the
plain
as
we
advanced
to
the
right
struck
us
as
fields
formed
almost
with
the
hopes
that
spirit
and
war
would
make
their
havoc
here
gentle
risings
sufficient
to
give
advantage
to
the
trees
there
was
no
sign
of
desolation
to
attract
the
if
it
were
not
for
the
importunity
of
boys
and
the
glitter
of
buttons
in
their
hands
there
would
be
no
sign
of
war
the
peasant
whistled
as
blithely
the
green
of
nature
was
as
deep
and
the
trees
waved
their
branches
as
softly
as
before
the
battle
the
houses
were
repaired
only
a
few
spots
with
white
plaster
between
the
bricks
pointed
out
the
cannon
ruin
and
in
ruins
there
was
only
hougoumont
which
was
attacked
so
bravely
and
defended
so
least
so
i
should
imagine
from
the
few
killed
in
the
garden
and
the
appearance
of
the
whole
while
so
many
french
lay
dead
in
the
field
in
the
garden
were
only
english
killed
while
in
the
field
and
on
the
other
side
french
not
counting
the
wounded
were
slain
indeed
the
gallantry
the
resolution
and
courage
which
the
french
displayed
in
attacking
this
place
guarded
from
the
heights
by
our
cannon
and
by
our
soldiers
through
the
would
alone
ennoble
the
cause
in
which
they
fought
before
arriving
at
hougoumont
the
spots
where
hill
picton
and
the
scotch
greys
did
their
several
deeds
were
pointed
out
to
us
the
spot
which
bore
the
dreadful
charge
of
cavalry
is
only
marked
by
a
hedge
the
cuirassiers
advancing
the
scots
a
masked
battery
which
fired
grape
into
the
adverse
party
it
was
the
scots
attacked
i
do
not
now
so
much
wonder
at
their
victory
the
cuirasses
which
we
saw
were
almost
all
marked
with
bullets
and
buonaparte
and
the
french
our
guide
said
much
admired
the
good
discipline
and
undaunted
courage
of
the
scot
going
forward
the
spot
at
which
the
prussians
the
lucky
gainers
of
the
battle
emerged
was
pointed
out
to
a
little
farther
on
we
were
shown
the
spot
where
colonel
howard
my
friend
cousin
was
buried
before
being
carried
to
england
three
trees
of
which
one
is
cut
down
mark
the
spot
now
ploughed
over
at
hougoumont
we
saw
the
untouched
chapel
where
our
wounded
lay
and
where
the
fire
consumed
the
toes
of
a
crucifix
we
there
inscribed
our
names
amongst
cits
and
lords
we
found
here
a
gardener
who
pointed
out
the
gate
where
the
french
were
all
gap
in
the
hedge
where
the
french
attempted
after
the
loss
of
men
to
storm
the
field
quarter
of
an
acre
in
which
were
heaps
of
gallic
corpses
the
gardener
and
the
dog
which
we
saw
had
been
detained
at
hougoumont
by
general
maitland
in
case
of
a
retreat
the
peasants
declare
that
from
to
the
affair
was
very
very
doubtful
and
that
at
the
last
charge
of
the
imperial
guards
napoleon
was
certain
of
being
in
brussels
in
wellington
after
the
defeat
of
the
prussians
on
the
went
to
waterloo
and
determined
where
he
would
place
each
corps
this
was
a
great
advantage
but
in
spite
of
the
excellence
of
his
position
he
would
certainly
have
been
defeated
had
it
not
been
for
the
fortunate
advance
of
the
prussians
from
hougoumont
we
went
to
the
house
which
is
the
rebuilding
of
the
house
where
was
buonaparte
last
station
and
it
was
from
this
spot
that
he
viewed
the
arrival
of
the
prussians
under
the
idea
of
their
being
the
corps
of
grouchy
it
was
here
he
felt
first
the
certainty
of
defeat
just
after
he
had
led
the
old
imperial
guard
in
the
certainty
of
victory
to
his
last
attack
la
belle
alliance
next
appeared
along
the
road
here
where
wellington
and
blücher
met
the
name
is
derived
from
a
marriage
in
the
time
of
peace
it
is
now
applicable
to
a
thence
we
returned
to
jean
after
going
again
to
hougoumont
there
we
were
shown
cuirasses
helms
buttons
swords
eagles
and
we
bought
the
helms
cuirasses
swords
of
an
officer
and
soldier
of
cuirassiers
besides
eagles
cockades
etc
beggars
the
result
of
english
profusion
a
dinner
measured
by
some
hungry
john
bull
hungry
stomach
we
rode
off
the
field
my
companion
singing
a
turkish
silent
full
gallop
cantering
over
the
field
the
finest
one
imaginable
for
a
battle
the
guide
told
us
that
the
account
buonaparte
guide
gave
of
him
after
the
battle
was
that
he
only
asked
the
road
to
paris
not
saying
anything
else
at
hougoumont
various
spots
were
pointed
out
amongst
the
rest
the
one
where
maitland
stood
watching
a
telegraph
on
the
neighbouring
rise
which
told
him
what
was
going
on
on
both
sides
we
rode
home
together
through
soignies
the
twilight
made
the
whole
length
of
the
road
more
pleasing
on
reaching
home
we
found
the
coach
was
jogged
so
much
so
that
it
would
not
allow
us
to
put
confidence
in
it
etc
at
last
we
gave
it
into
gordon
hands
my
friend
has
written
stanzas
on
waterloo
there
are
a
few
points
in
this
narrative
of
may
which
call
for
a
little
comment
as
to
the
spot
where
colonel
howard
my
friend
cousin
was
buried
before
being
carried
to
england
few
passages
in
the
canto
of
which
in
its
opening
deals
with
byron
experiences
in
these
days
are
better
known
than
the
stanzas
to
where
he
celebrates
the
death
of
young
gallant
howard
stanza
is
the
one
most
germane
to
our
immediate
there
have
been
tears
and
breaking
hearts
for
thee
and
mine
were
nothing
had
i
such
to
give
but
when
i
stood
beneath
the
fresh
green
tree
which
living
waves
where
thou
didst
cease
to
live
and
saw
around
me
the
wide
field
revive
with
fruits
and
fertile
promise
and
the
spring
come
forth
her
work
of
gladness
to
contrive
with
all
her
reckless
birds
upon
the
wing
i
turn
from
all
she
brought
to
those
she
could
not
bring
the
statement
that
the
coach
was
jogged
refers
to
that
calèche
which
had
been
just
bought
in
brussels
for
the
to
the
elaborate
some
trouble
ensued
over
the
calèche
the
coachmaker
who
had
sold
it
tried
to
make
lord
byron
pay
up
the
balance
of
the
price
not
carrying
his
point
he
got
a
to
seize
a
different
vehicle
a
chaise
belonging
to
the
poet
the
latter
so
far
as
appears
took
no
further
steps
to
write
stanzas
in
one
day
is
no
small
feat
especially
if
these
are
the
stanzas
of
and
if
the
substantial
work
of
the
day
consisted
in
riding
from
brussels
to
waterloo
and
back
and
deliberately
inspecting
the
field
of
battle
the
entry
as
written
by
charlotte
polidori
stands
which
i
apprehend
can
only
mean
stanzas
if
one
were
to
suppose
that
the
stanzas
thus
written
on
may
were
the
first
stanzas
of
canto
but
this
of
course
is
not
a
necessary
inference
byron
now
got
up
to
the
stanza
which
begins
and
wild
and
high
the
gathering
rose
i
made
up
my
accounts
and
was
not
a
little
startled
by
a
deficit
of
napoleons
which
i
at
last
found
was
a
mere
miscalculation
rode
about
thirty
miles
in
all
forgot
to
say
i
saw
sir
nath
aniel
wraxall
at
dover
who
having
introduced
himself
to
lord
byron
as
a
friend
began
talking
knocking
his
feet
in
rattattat
still
all
the
while
oppressed
by
feeling
very
awkward
i
do
not
find
in
byron
correspondence
any
reference
to
this
interview
on
april
or
with
sir
nathaniel
wraxall
but
in
his
letter
of
april
to
his
he
mentions
that
he
met
on
the
with
colonel
wildman
an
old
and
later
on
the
purchaser
of
newstead
abbey
who
gave
him
some
details
concerning
the
death
of
colonel
howard
at
waterloo
at
brussels
the
people
were
in
a
great
stew
the
night
of
the
battle
of
servants
and
others
waking
them
every
minute
to
tell
them
the
french
were
at
the
gates
some
germans
went
there
with
mighty
great
courage
in
flight
lord
w
ellington
sent
to
a
colonel
to
enquire
whether
he
was
going
to
fly
from
or
to
the
battle
giving
him
his
choice
to
act
in
either
way
on
hearing
this
the
said
colonel
boldly
faced
about
and
trotted
to
brussels
with
his
troop
a
supernumerary
the
brother
of
with
two
others
was
riding
between
the
ranks
while
the
french
were
firing
when
ours
crying
out
they
aim
at
you
all
three
were
struck
in
the
jaw
much
in
the
same
place
dead
after
the
battle
a
friend
asking
what
was
become
of
the
serjeant
pointed
to
his
feet
saying
there
which
was
fact
dacosta
the
guide
says
that
buonaparte
was
cool
and
collected
till
the
prussians
arrived
that
then
he
said
to
bertrand
that
appears
to
be
the
prussian
eagle
and
upon
bertrand
assenting
his
face
became
momentarily
pale
he
says
that
when
he
led
up
the
imperial
guard
on
arriving
at
the
house
he
went
behind
a
hillock
so
as
not
to
be
seen
and
so
gave
them
the
slip
wellington
acted
the
soldier
when
he
should
have
acted
the
general
and
the
dancer
when
he
should
have
been
the
soldier
i
can
not
after
viewing
the
ground
and
bearing
in
mind
the
men
superior
courage
give
wellington
the
palm
of
generalship
that
has
been
snatched
for
him
by
so
many
of
his
admirers
napoleon
only
took
one
glass
of
wine
from
the
beginning
of
the
battle
to
the
end
of
his
flight
up
at
ten
from
fatigue
whilst
at
breakfast
there
came
a
pryse
gordon
for
l
ord
b
yron
i
entertained
him
he
has
been
to
italy
and
travelled
a
great
gentleman
took
him
to
see
the
carriage
there
he
introduced
me
to
his
son
by
means
of
a
trumpet
after
his
departure
we
set
off
for
the
château
du
lac
where
we
found
the
hind
front
much
finer
than
the
other
for
want
of
the
startling
dome
and
low
windows
it
has
all
its
on
the
they
are
extremely
well
laid
out
both
with
regard
to
comfort
and
were
furnished
by
nap
oleon
we
saw
the
bed
where
josephine
marie
louise
and
the
queen
of
holland
have
been
treading
fast
on
one
another
heels
the
hall
for
concerts
divides
the
emperor
from
the
empress
has
a
rich
appearance
and
is
corinthian
the
flooring
of
the
emperor
is
all
wood
of
different
to
my
eye
a
more
pleasing
appearance
than
the
carpeted
ones
of
the
empress
i
sat
down
on
two
chairs
on
which
had
sat
he
who
ruled
the
world
at
one
time
some
of
his
eagles
were
yet
remaining
on
the
chairs
the
servant
seemed
a
little
astonished
at
our
bowing
before
them
we
returned
it
raining
all
the
while
after
dinner
g
ordon
came
for
us
to
go
to
coffee
we
went
and
were
graciously
received
lord
b
yron
as
himself
i
as
a
tassel
to
the
purse
of
merit
i
there
saw
a
painting
of
rembrandt
wife
or
mother
by
himself
which
was
full
of
life
and
some
verses
by
walter
scott
written
in
the
hostess
album
where
he
says
waterloo
will
last
longer
than
cressy
and
agincourt
how
different
they
only
agree
in
one
they
were
both
in
the
cause
of
injustice
the
novels
of
casti
were
presented
to
me
by
gordon
which
i
was
rather
surprised
at
we
came
over
scott
writes
in
m
rs
g
ordon
for
one
brief
hour
of
deathless
fame
scott
oh
walter
scott
for
shame
for
shame
byron
the
novels
of
the
abate
casti
who
died
in
are
notoriously
licentious
hence
i
suppose
polidori
surprise
at
the
presentation
of
them
by
gordon
byron
it
is
stated
by
this
gentleman
was
asked
by
gordon
on
may
to
write
some
lines
in
her
album
he
took
the
volume
away
with
him
and
on
the
following
day
brought
it
back
having
inserted
in
it
the
two
opening
stanzas
on
waterloo
forming
part
of
canto
of
stop
for
thy
tread
is
on
an
empire
dust
to
he
wears
the
shattered
links
of
the
world
broken
chain
g
ordon
and
son
came
while
at
breakfast
gave
us
letters
etc
saw
the
little
child
again
b
yron
gave
it
a
doll
it
may
be
excusable
to
suppose
that
this
trifling
incident
is
not
wholly
foreign
to
a
stanza
in
the
canto
of
this
stanza
comes
immediately
after
byron
has
begun
to
speak
of
the
rhine
and
incidentally
of
the
affection
which
his
bore
him
then
he
and
he
had
learn
to
know
not
why
for
this
in
such
as
him
seems
strange
of
the
helpless
looks
of
blooming
infancy
even
in
its
earliest
nurture
what
subdued
to
change
like
this
a
mind
so
far
imbued
with
scorn
of
man
it
little
boots
to
know
but
thus
it
was
and
though
in
solitude
small
power
the
nipp
affections
have
to
grow
in
him
this
glow
when
all
beside
had
ceased
to
glow
the
came
set
off
at
two
passing
through
a
country
increasing
in
inequalities
we
arrived
first
at
louvain
where
we
saw
the
outside
of
a
beautiful
which
is
one
of
the
prettiest
pieces
of
external
fretwork
i
have
seen
thence
we
went
to
tirlemont
where
was
a
jubilee
saints
and
sinners
under
the
red
canopy
the
sky
dirty
one
were
alike
in
the
streets
every
street
had
stuck
in
it
at
a
few
paces
from
the
or
feet
high
distant
from
one
another
or
feet
thence
to
trond
where
we
slept
i
suppose
the
country
is
highly
cultivated
and
the
trees
older
the
avenues
have
a
more
majestic
appearance
from
the
long
swells
of
ground
and
the
straight
roads
but
there
is
more
squalid
misery
than
i
have
seen
anywhere
the
houses
are
many
of
them
mud
and
the
only
clean
part
about
them
is
the
on
the
external
walls
dunghills
before
some
must
be
trodden
on
before
entering
the
houses
the
towns
also
fall
off
greatly
in
neat
and
comfortable
looks
the
walls
round
them
look
ruined
and
desolate
and
give
a
great
idea
of
insecurity
we
put
the
servants
on
off
from
trond
at
the
country
is
highly
cultivated
continual
hill
and
dale
lower
orders
miserable
in
perfection
houses
built
of
mud
the
upper
storeys
of
which
are
only
built
of
beams
the
mud
having
fallen
off
bridges
thrown
over
the
dirt
they
were
too
idle
to
remove
dunghills
at
their
doors
and
ditches
with
black
fetid
water
before
their
first
step
liège
has
a
pretty
neighbourhood
but
the
town
itself
is
filthy
and
disagreeable
they
visited
our
passports
here
at
three
different
places
the
hill
above
the
town
is
enormously
steep
and
from
some
way
beyond
it
has
a
beautiful
view
of
liège
with
its
towers
and
the
country
with
its
many
cots
and
of
the
meuse
the
road
now
lies
through
a
scene
where
cottages
are
spread
like
trees
and
hedges
like
furrows
of
corn
the
fields
are
so
minutely
divided
a
little
farther
still
we
had
a
most
splendid
view
through
many
miles
from
a
valley
we
could
see
everything
clearly
crowded
in
a
blue
tint
and
in
a
river
through
it
we
could
see
the
shadows
of
the
trees
the
cottages
are
improving
and
the
roads
becoming
the
worst
ever
seen
paved
still
but
so
horridly
hilled
and
vallied
that
the
rolling
of
the
carriage
is
like
the
rolling
of
a
ship
we
came
at
last
to
battice
but
before
entering
we
passed
by
a
village
where
beggar
little
cherubs
came
to
the
and
running
cried
out
quelque
chose
monsieur
le
chef
de
bataillon
another
monsieur
le
général
and
a
third
little
urchin
who
gesticulated
as
well
as
cried
perceiving
the
others
had
exhausted
the
army
cried
un
sou
messieurs
les
rois
des
hanovériens
we
arrived
at
battice
where
beggars
beggars
there
we
found
horses
just
come
in
after
debate
wherein
i
was
for
l
ord
b
yron
for
stopping
we
set
off
and
such
a
jolting
rolling
knocking
and
as
our
carriage
went
through
i
never
saw
which
put
l
ord
b
yron
to
accusing
me
of
bad
advice
clearing
however
as
the
road
mended
the
rain
fell
into
a
pond
to
be
illuminated
by
sunshine
before
we
reached
at
twelve
up
late
went
to
see
the
cathedral
full
of
people
lower
ranks
hearing
mass
miserable
painting
architecture
etc
saw
also
a
church
wherein
was
no
particular
picture
or
anything
at
liège
the
revolutionists
had
destroyed
the
fine
cathedral
a
german
boy
who
led
me
about
on
my
asking
him
in
broken
german
about
the
baths
led
me
to
a
very
different
place
i
was
astonished
to
find
myself
in
certain
company
the
baths
are
hot
water
the
are
only
shown
to
dukes
and
kings
so
a
kingdom
is
good
for
something
i
saw
the
baths
themselves
like
others
not
very
we
left
at
twelve
going
through
a
fine
country
with
no
hedges
but
fine
woods
in
the
distance
we
arrived
at
juliers
strongly
fortified
where
they
took
our
names
at
entering
and
at
exiting
it
is
a
neat
town
and
was
besieged
last
year
we
were
at
the
post
taken
by
a
man
for
frenchmen
and
he
told
us
we
had
been
driven
from
russia
by
a
band
of
the
emperor
he
seemed
to
be
very
fond
of
them
and
gave
as
a
reason
that
he
had
been
employed
by
them
for
many
years
and
i
forgetfully
saying
what
were
they
here
yes
and
farther
i
answered
moscou
oui
et
presque
plus
loin
that
presque
means
much
the
french
were
not
generally
liked
i
believe
the
lower
orders
perhaps
liked
them
but
the
middle
i
doubt
but
i
can
not
say
i
may
perhaps
be
influenced
by
the
opinion
of
a
beautiful
face
of
this
town
who
on
my
asking
her
whether
the
pas
beaucoup
les
answered
les
dames
we
find
it
a
great
inconvenience
that
the
poste
is
a
separate
concern
and
generally
pretty
distant
from
the
inn
the
women
are
many
of
them
very
beautiful
and
many
of
them
as
well
as
the
men
have
fine
dark
eyes
and
hair
the
men
wear
and
curl
their
hair
which
if
i
remember
rightly
was
the
custom
in
the
time
of
tacitus
many
of
the
women
wear
their
hair
combed
quite
back
and
upon
it
a
little
square
piece
of
linen
the
french
were
particularly
polite
during
the
siege
we
entered
the
dominions
of
the
king
of
prussia
a
little
beyond
battice
it
causes
a
strange
sensation
to
an
englishman
to
pass
into
one
state
from
another
without
crossing
any
visible
line
indeed
we
should
not
have
perceived
that
we
had
if
we
had
not
been
stopped
by
a
belgian
guard
who
asked
us
if
we
had
anything
to
declare
the
difference
is
however
very
striking
the
men
the
women
everything
the
cottages
the
people
look
cleaner
though
everything
else
is
dirty
contrary
to
the
belgians
they
seem
to
collect
their
cleanliness
upon
themselves
instead
of
throwing
it
upon
their
cots
tins
trees
and
shrubs
we
arrived
at
cologne
after
much
bad
sandy
heavy
road
at
the
pavement
begins
to
be
interrupted
after
aix
but
ends
almost
entirely
after
juliers
cologne
is
upon
a
flat
on
the
rhine
we
were
groaning
at
having
no
sight
of
cologne
when
we
came
suddenly
under
its
battlements
and
towers
we
passed
through
its
fortifications
without
question
after
having
found
the
gates
shut
and
feed
the
porter
we
found
inns
full
and
at
last
got
into
the
hôtel
de
prague
up
very
bad
sat
down
to
breakfast
just
done
we
heard
some
singing
enquiry
told
us
buyable
got
them
up
a
harp
played
by
a
german
pretty
and
two
fiddlers
she
played
and
sang
which
brought
back
a
chain
of
scotch
recollections
and
a
german
song
then
a
beautiful
march
in
which
the
music
died
away
and
then
suddenly
revived
after
a
waltz
we
dismissed
them
we
both
mounted
a
voiture
and
drove
through
the
town
to
the
cathedral
great
part
pulled
down
by
the
revolutionists
and
the
roof
of
the
nave
obliged
to
be
restored
with
plain
staring
monument
over
gallic
ruin
there
is
fine
stained
glass
and
the
effect
of
its
being
very
high
and
variegated
in
the
choir
is
beautiful
we
saw
a
fine
painting
here
by
kalf
vide
the
tomb
of
the
three
kings
said
to
be
worth
three
millions
of
francs
and
an
immensely
rich
treasury
wherein
was
a
sacrament
worth
one
million
of
francs
in
falling
down
a
step
i
broke
a
glass
for
which
they
at
first
would
not
take
at
last
cost
me
three
francs
kept
countenance
amazingly
well
went
to
see
ursula
church
where
we
were
shown
virgins
skulls
of
ninety
years
old
male
and
female
all
jumbled
into
a
mass
of
virgins
bones
arranged
all
in
gilt
etc
a
whole
room
bedecked
with
them
all
round
indeed
whatever
we
saw
were
relics
skulls
some
in
the
heads
of
busts
some
arranged
in
little
cells
with
velvet
cases
wherein
was
worked
the
name
of
each
paintings
of
ursula
etc
asked
for
a
piece
out
of
the
masses
only
got
a
smile
and
a
point
of
a
finger
to
an
interdiction
in
latin
which
i
did
not
read
we
went
to
see
a
picture
of
rubens
nailing
of
peter
to
a
the
best
design
though
not
very
good
i
yet
have
seen
of
his
a
german
artist
copying
it
spoke
english
to
us
returned
home
sent
my
name
to
professor
wallraf
got
admission
found
a
venerable
old
man
who
has
spent
his
life
in
making
a
collection
of
paintings
and
other
objects
of
vertù
belonging
to
his
country
cologne
which
he
intends
leaving
to
his
native
town
this
is
no
doubt
the
wallraf
who
was
joint
founder
of
the
celebrated
museum
in
cologne
the
statement
which
ensues
as
to
an
early
named
kaft
is
noticeable
whether
correct
i
am
unable
to
say
the
museum
does
not
contain
any
painting
by
tintoretto
to
which
the
name
could
apply
there
is
a
fine
picture
by
him
of
and
many
pictures
were
extremely
good
especially
painting
of
individuals
kaft
was
a
native
of
this
town
who
painted
in
oil
before
was
known
saw
some
poussins
claude
lorraines
some
moderate

tintoretto
of
beautiful
colouring
and
drawing
strong
and
expressive

some
empires
and
has
coined
kinds
of
gold
he
had
made
drawings
of
them
but
the
revolution
stopped
it
the
revolutionary
gauls
he
said
with
a
tear
in
his
eye
had
destroyed
many
very
valuable
relics
of

he
said

german
poetry
that
i
did
not

and
laughed
at
the
oddity
of
her
gesticulation
which
she
took
for
laughter
at
the
wit
of
a
poet
who
was
describing
the
want
of

highly
pleased
the

set
off
after
having
defeated
the
imposition
of
a

to

the

not
anything

till
we

i
saw
yesterday
a

saw
the
first
vines
a
little
before
entering
cologne
some
days
ago
we
left
bonn
at
eleven
the
town
having
nothing
in
particular
the
seven
hills
were
the
first
that
struck
our
sight
on
one
of
the
highest
pinnacles
in
drachenfels
now
a
mere
ruin
formerly
a
castle
of
which
many
a
tale
is
told
there
was
by
the
roadside
a
monument
raised
upon
the
spot
where
one
noble
brother
killed
another
crucifixes
all
the
way
we
had
the
river
on

side
whence
rose

and

two
points
particularly
struck
drachenfels
and
the
view
at
a
distance
before
coming
to
videnhar
when
the
distant
hills
were
black
with
the
rain
but
the
whole
way
it
is
one
of
the
finest
scenes
i
imagine
in
the
world
the
large
river
with
its
massy
swells
and
varied
towered
banks
we
changed
horses
at
bemagne
and
passed
over
a
road

cut
by
aurelius
theodoric
and
buonaparte
b
uonaparte
name
is
everywhere
who
did
this

that
there
is
an
inscription
to
record
this
fine
entrance
from
bemagne
with
its
massy
towers
and
church
from
andernach
we
passed
on
saw
on
the
other
side
neuwied
a
town
owing
its
existence
to
the
mere
toleration
of
religion
it
is
the
finest
and
most
flourishing
we
have
seen
since
ghent
and
antwerp
we
saw
the
tomb
of
hoche
at
a
distance
went
to
it
there
was
inscribed
the
army
of
the
sambre
and
the
moselle
to
its
hoche
the
reliefs
are
torn
off
the
marble
slabs
broken
and
it
is
falling
glory
of
the
fallen
brave
shall
men
remember
though
forgot
their
grave
and
the
enemies
may
launch
malicious
darts
against
it
after
andernach
the
rhine
loses
much
the
valley
is
wider
and
the
beautiful
after
the
almost
sublime
palls
and
man
is
fastidious
the
celebrated
lyric
by
byron
introduced
into
an
address
to
his
is
stated
farther
on
to
have
been
written
on
this
very
day
i
cite
the

the

crag
of
drachenfels
frowns
the
wide
and
winding
rhine
whose
breast
of
waters
broadly
swells
between
the
banks
which
bear
the
vine
and
hills
all
rich
with
blossom
trees
and
fields
which
promise
corn
and
wine
and
scatter
cities
crowning
these
whose
far
white
walls
along
them
shine
have
strew
a
scene
which
i
should
see
with
double
joy
wert
thou
with
me
about
a
mile
from
coblentz
we
saw
marceau
dark
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
moselle

coblentz
asked
of

rascals
went
to
the

marceau
was
here
at
this
inn
and
the
pierced
it
several
were
french
officers
here
when
they
would
not
believe
the
cossacks
would
pass
they
had
to
fly
as
quick
as
horses
could
convey
them

never

sent
the
waiter
in
search
of
a
louis
he
had
never
dropped
and
went
flying

in

of
me
marceau
died
in
of
a
wound
received
near
altenkirchen
at
the
age
of
only
high
honours
were
paid
to
his
remains
both
by
his
own
army
and
by

austrians
whom
he
had
been
combating
polidori
passes
rapidly
from
the
affair
of
marceau
to
that
of
french
officers
and
a
body
of
cossacks
but
it
is
clear
that
these
two
matters
have
no
real
connexion
the
latter
must
relate
to
or
byron
devotes
to
marceau
two
stanzas
of
by
coblentz
on
a

let
not

gush

yet
envying

died
at
wetzlar
in

may
be
noticed
that
byron
line
writes
heroes
plural
followed
by

singular
heroes
must
be
intended
for
both

and
i
suspect
that

a
misprint
for
enemies
up
looked
at
the
fine

went
to

to

in

is
what
l
ord

wrote
to
l
eigh
some
days
ago
written
may
on
see
from
the
castled
crag
of
drachenfels
to
still
sweeten
more
these
banks
of
rhine
mayence
where
i
saw
the
spot
where
they
said
lately
stood
the
house
where
printing
was
invented
it
had
been
pulled
down
by
the
french
the
gallery
i
could
not
see
because
the
keeper
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
make
a
promenade
saw
the
cathedral
pierced
at
the
roof
by
bombs
in
the
last
siege
the
town
underwent
the
of
which
were
in
a
good
decapitated
there
was
a
german
marshal
who
was
represented
as
gravely
putting
forth
his
powdered
head
from
under
a
tombstone
he
has
just
lifted
an
inscription
saying
i
am
here
from
mayence
we
went
to
mannheim
through
a
fine
country
crossed
the
rhine
on
a
bridge
of
boats
taken
very
ill
with
a
fever
at
not
write
my
journal
a
little
recovered
set
off
fine
alleys
of
and
villages
entered
carlsruhe
through
a
grove
of
scotch
firs
and
other
trees
that
had
a
fine
effect
saw
the
palace
entered
the
inn
and
was
very
ill
took
ipecac
and
op
gr
headache
vertigo
tendency
to
fainting
etc
magnesia
and
lemon
little
better
no
effect
went
a
drive
about
the
town
saw
the
neatest
town
we
have
yet
met
with
the
only
objection
is
the
houses
stuccoed
for
the
eyes
saw
the
outside
of
the
palace
and
went
into
the
garden
laid
out
in
the
english
manner
went
home
dreadful
headaches
ate
some
stewed
apples
took
some
more
magn
esia
and
acid
had
no
effect
lay
down
got
up
after
two
hours
was
just
going
out
when
l
ord
b
yron
came
to
take
from
my
hand
a
plated
candlestick
to
give
me
a
brass
one
got
on
a
few
steps
fainted
my
fall
brought
the
servants
to
me
took
pills
going
out
again
when
l
ord
b
yron
made
the
servant
put
down
the
plated
candlestick
to
take
up
a
brass
one
went
to
bed
this
as
polidori
evidently
thought
was
an
odd
incident
not
easily
accounted
for
one
can
not
suppose
that
byron
simply
aimed
at
humiliating
or
mortifying
his
physician
there
must
have
been
a
candle
in
each
candlestick
and
it
is
conceivable
that
the
candle
in
the
brass
one
was
the
longer
and
therefore
the
more
suitable
for
an
invalid
who
might
have
needed
it
throughout
the
night
medicine
had
violent
effect
better
on
the
whole
though
weak
just
as
we
were
going
out
i
met
sir
hunter
at
my
who
told
me
he
had
heard
so
bad
an
account
of
my
positively
dying
that
he
came
to
enquire
how
i
found
myself
i
asked
him
in
he
took
care
to
tell
us
he
was
a
great
friend
of
the
grand
duke
who
had
sent
his
groom
of
the
stole
he
called
it
stool
in
search
of
lodgings
for
the
worthy
mayor
gave
us
a
long
sermon
about
rheumatism
routes
etc
left
us
in
the
evening
he
sent
in
the
du
voyageur
en
les
pays
de
begging
in
return
some
of
l
ord
b
yron
poems
went
out
saw
a
church
columns
like
golden
capitals
loaded
everywhere
with
gilt
perhaps
tawdry
but
the
environs
are
beautiful
drove
a
great
deal
about
fine
trees
and
fine
cultivation
carlsruhe
to
offenberg
much
better
slept
halfway
blinds
down
the
other
so
nothing
to
mention
except
fine
trees
fine
cocked
hats
fine
women
and
postillions
off
from
offenberg
saw
some
scenes
that
pleased
me
much
hills
and
clouds
upon
them
woods
with
mists
passed
through
freiburg
where
we
saw
the
steeple
pervious
to
the
top
with
showing
the
light
which
had
to
my
eyes
a
beautiful
appearance
i
think
charles
when
he
said
the
german
for
his
horse
remembered
the
g
erman
postillions
for
they
talk
to
theirs
and
the
horses
on
their
part
listen
and
seem
to
understand
the
greater
part
of
i
have
found
the
ladies
in
a
strange
costume
of
short
wide
red
petticoats
with
many
folds
and
a
hat
of
straw
as
wide
as
a
wheel
arrived
at

got
to
a
hill

a
fine

were
in

unequal
parts
very
high
and
some

after

went
to
take
a
walk
went
upon
the
rhine
a
hill
in
the
town
bâle
presumably
to
see
a
panorama
of
thun
the
first
swiss
one
crowded
foolishly
with
people
and
too
small
saw
a
gallery
that
the

formed

agreed
with
a
voiturier
to
take
our
carriages
to
geneva
in
five
days
set
off
country
increases
from
hills
to
mountains
with
great
beauty
passed
through
lipstadt
and
came
to
went
before
supper
to
climb
a
hill
where
we
found
a
goatherd
who
could
not
understand
the
french
that
asked
for
milk
till
it
had
the
commentary
we
will
pay
for
it
the
scene
was
very
fine
to
the
right
beautiful
to
the
left
it
had
a
tendency
to
sublimity
on
one
side
hills
covered
to
the
top
with
trees
on
the
other
mountains
with
bald
pates
came
down
found
the
servants
playing
at
bowls
they
were
obliged
to
run
the
bowls
along
a
narrow
board
to
the
men
supper
read
went
to
bed
at
passed
the
jura
mountains
where
we
saw
some
fine
castellated
scenery
and
women
ornamented
short
petticoats
not
below
the
knee
with
black
crape
rays
round
their
heads
that
make
them
look
very
spidery
soleure
is
a
neat
town
with
stone
fortifications
and
a
clean
church
with
fountains
before
it
the
houses
in
this
neighbourhood
have
a
pleasing
strange
appearance
on
account
of
the
roofs
which
slant
out
on
every
side
a
great
way
immense
number
of
scotch
fine
voituriers
slow
and
have
eight
francs
of
a
day
being
two
which
being
too
much
according
to
the
du
voyageur
en
where
it
is
said
we
showed
it
to
our
courier
who
was
in
a
passion
came
to
where
we
slept
got
a
sight
of
some
fine
alpine
mountains
came
to
berne
delightfully
situated
beautiful
streets
with
arcades
all
their
length
dined
there
saw
a
splendidly
beautiful
view
coming
down
a
hill
with
hills
covered
with
fir
ash
beech
and
all
the
catalogue
of
trees
morat
at
the
bottom
and
the
jura
mounts
behind
with
snowy
hair
and
cloudy
arrived
at
morat
neat
with
arcades
stopped
at
the
crown
inn
all
the
way
had
debates
whether
clouds
were
mountains
or
mountains
clouds
innkeeper
at
morat
being
a
little
tipsy
and
thinking
every
englishman
being
a
philosophe
must
be
a
philosophe
like
himself
favoured
us
with
some
of
his
infidel
notions
while
serving
us
at
supper
near
morat
was
fought
the
battle
wherein
the
burgundians
were
so
completely
thrashed
their
bones
of
which
we
took
pieces
are
now
very
few
once
they
formed
a
mighty
heap
in
the
chapel
but
both
were
destroyed
by
the
burgundian
division
when
in
switzerland
and
a
tree
of
liberty
was
planted
over
it
which
yet
flourishes
in
all
its
liberty
has
flown
from
the
planters
grasp
saw
aventicum
there
remains
sufficient
of
the
walls
to
trace
the
boundaries
of
the
ancient
town
but
of
all
the
buildings
both
for
gods
and
men
nothing
but
a
column
remains
and
that
the
only
remnant
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
there
are
mosaic
pavements
and
even
the
streets
may
be
perceived
in
a
dry
summer
by
the
grass
being
thinner
the
mosaic
in
a
barn
probably
once
of
a
temple
was
pretty
perfect
till
the
gallic
cavalry
came
and
turned
it
into
a
stable
it
is
formed
of
little
pieces
of
black
white
and
red
bricks
little
now
remains
there
was
also
a
copper
vessel
in
the
middle
that
too
has
disappeared
the
town
is
shamefully
negligent
of
the
antiquities
of
their
fathers
for
there
is
another
more
beautiful
and
perfect
mosaic
pavement
discovered
but
which
they
have
allowed
the
proprietor
to
cover
again
with
mould
rather
than
buy
it
we
found
in
a
barn
heads
plinths
capitals
and
shafts
heaped
promiscuously
the
capital
is
deeply
sharply
and
beautifully
cut
a
head
of
apollo
in
all
the
rudeness
of
first
capital
of
a
strange
mixed
order
there
is
the
amphitheatre
hollow
yet
pretty
perfect
but
no
stonework
visible
overgrown
with
trees
the
size
my
companion
told
me
was
larger
than
common
in
the
town
there
were
some
beautiful
fragments
of
incorporated
in
the
walls
all
marble
in
the
walls
of
the
church
we
sought
in
vain
for
the
inscription
that
mathison
mentions
to
julia
alpinula
both
to
morat
and
to
aventicum
avenches
byron
devotes
some
stanzas
in
to
and
notes
to
correspond
morat
he
terms
the
proud
the
patriot
field
he
speaks
of
the
hoard
of
bones
and
says
i
ventured
to
bring
away
as
much
as
may
have
made
a
quarter
of
a
hero
for
careful
preservation
his
reference
to
aventicum
and
the
inscription
to
julia
alpinula
reads
rather
curiously
in
the
light
of
polidori
avowal
that
we
sought
in
vain
for
the
inscription
readers
must
always
i
apprehend
have
inferred
the
contrary
by
a
lone
wall
a
lonelier
column
rears
a
grey
and
aspect
of
old
days
is
the
last
remnant
of
the
wreck
of
years
and
looks
as
with
the
wild
bewildered
gaze
of
one
to
stone
converted
by
amaze
yet
still
with
consciousness
and
there
it
stands
making
a
marvel
that
it
not
decays
when
the
coeval
pride
of
human

strew

of

the

we
went
to

we
have
seen
in
many
places
boys
leading
goats
just
in
the
antique
style
thence
we
went
to
town
stopped
for
refreshments
one
fine
view
we
have
had
all
the
way
but
nothing
equal
to
the
view
descending
to
morat
darkness
came
on
we
saw
the
castle
wherein
defended
himself
against
the
french
who
besieged
it
for
a
month
looks
so
weak
it
seems
a
wonder
the
swiss
castles
are
not
nearly
so
interesting
as
the
rhine
ones
they
are
very
and
no
battlements
we
saw
the
lake
but
for
a
long
time
doubted
whether
it
was
a
cloud
below
a
mist
before
or
water
beneath
us
entered
lausanne
lausanne
after
having
looked
at
a
bookseller
who
showed
me
a
fine
collection
of
bad
books
for
four
louis
enquired
for
dewar
name
not
known
we
went
along
the
lake
that
a
little
disappointed
me
as
it
does
not
seem
so
broad
as
it
really
is
and
the
mountains
near
it
though
covered
with
snow
have
not
a
great
appearance
on
account
of
the
height
of
the
lake
itself
we
saw
mont
blanc
in
the
distance
ethereal
in
appearance
mingling
with
the
clouds
it
is
more
than
miles
from
where
we
saw
it
it
is
a
classic
ground
we
go
over

except

perhaps
some
readers
may
need
to
be
reminded
who

was
he
was
a
great

both
practical
and
speculative
charles
bonnet
author
of

arrived
at
lord

having
put
his
age
down
as
received
a
letter
after
from
inn
keeper
thing
that
seems
worthy
of
a

it
begins
again
to
be
the

who
till
the

were

improving

breakfast
and
having
made
up
the
accounts
to
and
having
heard
that
the
voituriers
made
a
claim
of
all
the
way
back
we
ordered
a
calèche
but
happening
to
go
into
the
garden
we
saw
a
boat
into
which
entering
we
pushed
out
upon
the
leman
lake
after
rowing
some
time
happening
to
come
to
the
ferry
we
found
the
waiter
with
a
direful
look
to
tell
us
that
it
was
pour
un
monsieur
who
happened
to
be

got
another
and
went
out
to
bathe

with

upon

to
see

and
first
on
the
leman
did
us
much
good
dined
entered
the
calèche
drove
through
geneva
where
i
saw
an
effect
of
building
that
pleased
me
it
was
porticoes
from
the
very
roof
of
the
high
houses
to
the
bottom
went
to
the
house
beyond
cologny
that
belonged
to
diodati
they
ask

from

there

one
was
jean

the

marc

pictet
to
as
polidori
speaks
farther
on
of
pictet
as
being
aged
about
the
former
would
appear
to
be
meant
he
had
been
in

a

visited
john

a
genevese
professor
of

compact
phrase
narrow
not
true
is
by
no
means
clear
perhaps
he
means
that
some
one
had
warned
him
that
the
villa
diodati
called
also
the
villa
belle

was
inconveniently
narrow
but
on
inspecting

have
it
villa
diodati
for
three
family
it
must
apparently
mean
either
that
an
english
family
were
occupying
or
had
bespoken
villa
diodati
and
would
remain
there
for
three
years
to
come
which
is
in
conflict
with
the
fact
that
byron
soon
afterwards
became
the
tenant
or
else
that
byron
thought
of
renting
it
for
a
term
as
long
as
three
years
which
was
barred
by
the
previous
claim
of
some
english
family
on
the
whole
the
latter
supposition
seems
to
me
the
more
feasible
but
one
is
surprised
to
think
that
byron
had
of
remaining
near
geneva
for
any
such
great
length
of
time
this
sets
one
mind
speculating
about
miss
clairmont
with
whom
as
is
well
known
amour
had
begun
before
he
left
london
and
who
had
now
just
arrived
to
join
him
at
sécheron
had
he
at
this
time
any
notion
of
settling
down
with
her
in
the
neighbourhood
for
three
years
more
or
less
it
is
a
curious
point
to
consider
for
us
who
know
how
rapidly
he
discarded
her
and
how
harshly
he
treated
her
ever
afterwards
miss
clairmont
we
see
was
now
already
on
the
spot
along
with
percy
and
mary
shelley
in
fact
as
we
learn
from
other
sources
they
had
arrived
at
sécheron
hôtel
de
as
far
back
as
may
or
perhaps
may
byron
now
for
the
first
time
encountered
the
three
it
appears
that
he
must
have
met
mary
godwin
in
london
probably
only
to
speak
of
clare
shelley
to
the
best
of
our
information
he
had
never
till
now
seen
at
all
polidori
here
terms
clare
clairmont
the
sister
of
wollstonecraft
godwin
and
in
the
entry
for
may
he
even
applies
the
name
wollstonecraft
godwin
to
clare
and
it
will
be
found
as
we
proceed
that
for
some
little
while
he
really
supposed
the
two
ladies
to
be
sisters
in
the
right
sense
of
the
term
both
of
them
bearing
the
surname
of
godwin
in
point
of
fact
there
was
no
being
the
daughter
of
and
the
first
godwin
and
clare
the
daughter
of
and
clairmont
it
may
be
as
well
to
add
that
the
letters
addressed
by
miss
clairmont
to
byron
before
they
actually
met
in
london
have
now
been
published
in
works
of
lord
byron
letters
and
vol
iii
pp
and
they
certainly
exhibit
a
degree
of
forwardness
and
importunity
which
accounts
in
some
measure
for
his
eventual
antipathy
to
her
found
letter
from
de
roche
inviting
me
to
breakfast
curious
with
regard
to
l
ord
b
yron
dined
p
ercy
s
helley
the
author
of
came
bashful
shy
consumptive
separated
from
his
wife
keeps
the
two
daughters
of
godwin
who
practise
his
theories
one
l
ord
b
yron
this
is
a
very
noticeable
jotting
shelley
appears
to
have
come
in
alone
on
this
occasion
and
we
may
infer
that
some
very
confidential
talk
ensued
between
him
and
byron
in
the
presence
of
polidori
he
was
not
at
this
date
really
years
of
age
but
only
bashful
shy
is
an
amusingly
simple
description
of
him
as
to
consumptive
we
know
that
shelley
left
england
under
the
impression
that
consumption
had
him
in
its
grip
but
this
hardly
appears
to
have
been
truly
the
case
polidori
as
a
medical
man
might
have
been
expected
to
express
some
doubt
on
the
subject
unless
the
poet
outward
appearance
looked
consumptive
next
we
hear
that
shelley
keeps
the
two
daughters
of
godwin
who
practise
his
theories
set
the
at
defiance
or
act
upon
the
principle
of
free
love
one
might
suppose
from
this
phrase
that
polidori
believed
shelley
to
be
the
accepted
lover
of
miss
clairmont
as
well
as
of
mary
godwin
but
the
addition
of
those
very
significant
one
lord
byron
in
the
opposite
direction
these
words
can
only
mean
what
was
the
fact
that
one
of
these
ladies
viz
miss
clairmont
was
lord
mistress
therefore
polidori
in
saying
that
shelley
kept
the
two
daughters
of
godwin
may
presumably
have
meant
that
he
housed
and
maintained
clare
while
he
was
the
of
mary
whether
polidori
now
for
the
first
time
learned
from
the
conversation
of
byron
and
shelley
what
was
the
relation
subsisting
between
clare
and
byron
or
whether
byron
had
at
some
earlier
date
imparted
the
facts
to
him
is
a
question
which
must
remain
unsolved
the
latter
appears
to
me
extremely
probable
for
byron
had
certainly
arranged
to
meet
clare
near
geneva
and
he
may
very
likely
have
given
the
requisite
notice
beforehand
to
his
travelling
physician
and
daily
associate
my
aunt
charlotte
polidori
was
not
an
adept
in
shelleian
detail
if
she
had
been
i
fear
that
these
sentences
would
have
shocked
her
sense
of
propriety
and
they
would
have
been
left
uncopied
they
form
the
only
passage
in
her
transcript
which
bears
in
any
way
upon
the
amour
between
lord
byron
and
miss
clairmont
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
and
belief
there
was
not
in
the
original
diary
any
other
passage
pointing
in
the
same
may
observe
here
that
there
is
nothing
in
journal
to
show
that
the
shelley
party
were
staying
in
the
same
sécheron
hotel
with
lord
byron
professor
dowden
says
that
they
suppose
with
some
sufficient
authority

i
think

assumed

asked
him
as
a
favour
not
to
tell
l
ord
b
yron
what
he
gave
for
his

as
he
thought
it
quite
fit
that
milord
payment
be
double
we
sent
berger
to
say
we
did
not
wish
for
the
boat
the
statement
that
shelley
went
from
lucerne
with
the
two
with
merely
to
england
along
the
rhine
in
bateaux
refers
of
course
to
what
had
taken
place
in
on
the
occasion
of
shelley
elopement
with
mary
godwin
and
has
no
bearing
on
the
transactions
of
it
must
be
cited
by
polidori
as
showing
how
inexpensively
three
persons
could
if
so
minded
travel
from
switzerland
to
england
the
other
references
to
shelley
domestic
affairs
etc
are
very
curious
except
as
to
his
own
personal
admiration
for
polidori
is
here
evidently
putting
down
but
not
in
the
words
of
shelley
himself
who
would
assuredly
not
have
said
that
he
had
seduced
mary
godwin
such
details
as
the
poet
imparted
to
him
they
are
far
from
accurate
to
some
extent
polidori
may
have
remembered
imperfectly
what
shelley
told
him
but
i
think
the
latter
must
have
been
responsible
for
most
of
the
fables
and
generally
it
would
appear
that
shelley
gave
free
rein
to
his
inclination
for
romancing
or
for
matters
possibly
perceiving
that
polidori
was
credulous
and
capable
of
swallowing
whatever
he
was
told
the
more
eccentric
the
better
to
say
that
shelley
before
he
at
the
age
of
barely
married
harriet
westbrook
in
thought
that
he
was
dying
and
that
his
only
practical
motive
for
marrying
her
was
that
she
might
come
in
for
a
jointure
after
his
decease
is
no
doubt
highly
fallacious
and
even
absurd
we
have
other
sources
of
information
as
to
these
occurrences
especially
the
letters
of
shelley
addressed
at
the
time
to
jefferson
hogg
and
they
tell
a
very
different
tale
as
to
his
reason
for
separating
from
harriet
shelley
we
perceive
simply
told
polidori
that
he
found
he
could
not
agree
with
her
he
said
nothing
as
to
his
knowing
or
supposing
that
she
had
been
unfaithful
to
him
again
shelley
was
not
so
boyish
as
when
he
published
a
first
novel
the
egregious
the
publication
took
place
in
when
he
was
eighteen
or
at
lowest
seventeen
the
statement
that
he
got
by
his
second
work
is
worth
considering
if
his
second
work
means
as
one
might
naturally
suppose
in
this
connexion
the
romance
of
the
suggestion
that
he
got
anything
at
all
by
it
except
a
state
of
indebtedness
is
a
novelty
but
our
mind
recurs
to
that
rumoured
and
apparently
really
published
though
wholly
untraced
work
of
his
poetical
essay
on
the
existing
state
of
this
poem
was
published
we
are
told
for
the
benefit
of
an
irish
agitator
or
patriot
peter
finnerty
and
it
has
been
elsewhere
averred
that
the
publication
produced
a
sum
of
nearly
the
mention
by
polidori
of
may
be
surmised
to
refer
to
the
same
matter
and
it
tends
so
far
to
confirm
the
idea
that
the
book
really
existed
and
even
secured
a
fair
measure
of
who
is
named
in
connexion
with
byron
and
the
hire
for
the
boat
was
as
already
noted
the
swiss
servant
of
byron
brought
from
london
with
shelley
read
italian
with
s
helley
dined
went
into
a
boat
with
s
helley
and
rowed
all
night
till
tea
together
chatted
etc
with
s
helley
entered
a
calèche
took
house
for
louis
for
or
days
saw
several
houses
for
shelley
one
good
dined
went
in
the
boat
all
tea
together
necker
house
here
mentioned
would
apparently
be
the
same
as
the
villa
diodati
or
villa
belle
that
is
the
house
which
byron
did
in
fact
rent
necker
may
be
understood
as
meaning
rather
than
the
famous
minister
of
finance
in
france
his
widow
since
necker
himself
had
died
a
dozen
years
before
the
sum
of
louis
seems
to
be
specified
here
as
the
rent
for
a
year
and
the
phrase
about
days
must
indicate
that
the
house
could
be
tenanted
for
that
short
space
of
let
us
say
a
a
proportionate
payment
this
rate
of
rental
appears
low
and
it
differs
both
from
what
was
said
under
the
date
of
may
and
from
what
we
shall
find
noted
shortly
afterwards
june
thus
i
feel
a
little
doubt
whether
necker
house
is
not
in
reality
something
quite
different
from
the
villa
diodati
proposed
tenancy
of
the
former
might
possibly
have
been
cancelled

then
at

with

anxious
searching

till
he
came
to
that
little
poet
and
disagreeable
person
when
he
tore

and
said
now
this

went

and
said
it
is
strange
to
hear
a
man
talking
of

who
seals
his
letters
with
a
tallow
candle
shelley
is
another
instance
of
wealth
inducing
relations
to
confine
for
madness
and
was
only
saved
by
his
physician
being
honest
he
was
betrothed
from
a
boy
to
his
cousin
for
age
another
came
who
had
as
much
as
he
have
and
she
left
him
because
he
was
an
atheist
when
starving
a
friend
to
whom
he
had
given
though
he
knew
it
would
not
come
near
him
heard
shelley
repeat
coleridge
on
pitt
which
persuades
me
he
is
a
poet
here
we
see
that
shelley
must
have
repeated
to
polidori
that
famous
story
of
his
about
the
attempt
of
his
father
to
consign
him
when
he
was
an
eton
student
to
a
madhouse
and
about
the
zealous
and
ultimately
successful
effort
of
lind
the
eton
physicist
to
save
him
from
that
disastrous
fate
next
comes
the
statement
that
shelley
was
betrothed
from
boyhood
to
his
beautiful
cousin
miss
harriet
marriage
to
take
effect
when
he
should
attain
his
majority
an
account
which
we
know
to
be
substantially
true
the
conduct
of
miss
perhaps
we
should
rather
say
of
her
parents
as
dictating
her
placed
in
an
unfavourable
light
for
it
is
plainly
suggested
that
she
abandoned
shelley
for
another
bridegroom
on
the
ground
of
a
more
immediate
advantage
in
worldly
allegation
of
percy
atheism
being
more
a
pretext
than
a
genuine
motive
the
passage
about
a
friend
to
whom
shelley
had
given
must
i
suppose
beyond
a
doubt
refer
to
godwin
but
it
is
evident
that
shelley
in
speaking
to
polidori
a
comparative
stranger
and
this
in
the
presence
of
mary
had
the
delicacy
to
suppress
the
name
the
charge
thus
alleged
against
godwin
is
not
i
conceive
accurate
although
it
approximated
towards
accuracy
i
am
not
clear
that
shelley
up
to
the
time
when
he
thus
spoke
in
june
had
given
godwin
money
amounting
to
quite
so
large
a
total
as
but
at
any
rate
he
can
not
have
done
so
up
to
the
time
when
he
was
himself
starving
in
milder
terms
when
he
was
in
very
great
and
harassing
straits
for
money
and
daily
subsistence
that
time
was
late
in
and
in
the
first
days
of
it
is
true
that
even
before
this
date
he
had
done
something
to
relieve
godwin
but
it
was
only
i
think
in
april
that
he
gave
the
philosopher
a
really
very
considerable
in
a
lump
i
say
all
this
for
the
sake
of
biographical
truth
and
not
with
a
view
to
vindicating
policy
of
bleeding
shelley
in
purse
while
he
cut
him
in
person
has
in
some
recent
years
been
denounced
with
increasing
vehemence
and
it
was
indeed
wholly
indefensible
but
human
especially
the
human
nature
of
an
abstract
speculator
like
capable
of
very
odd
and
i
dare
say
godwin
thought
he
was
equally
and
strictly
right
in
both
his
in
getting
large
sums
of
money
out
of
shelley
for
a
reforming
sage
ought
to
be
subsidized
by
his
right
in
repudiating
and
abusing
shelley
for
the
latter
had
applied
godwin
own
theories
to
that
one
instance
of
practice
which
the
philosopher
did
not
at
all
proceed
to
another
point
the
lines
of
coleridge
on
pitt
which
polidori
heard
recited
by
shelley
are
to
be
sought
for
in
his
early
poem
entitled
famine
and
in
that
poem
need
i
say
it
those
three
infernal
deities
are
represented
as
meeting
in
a
desolated
tract
in
la
vendée
and
on
mutual
enquiry
they
learn
that
one
and
the
same
person
has
sent
them
thither
all
three
letters
four
do
form
his
name
the
name
pitt
famine
and
slaughter
finally
agree
that
the
multitude
exasperated
by
their
sufferings
shall
turn
upon
pitt
and
rend
they
shall
tear
him
limb
from
limb
fire
who
has
just
come
from
doing
pitt
errands
in
ireland
thinks
this
ungrateful
she
concludes
the
poem
with
the
memorable
ninety
months
he
by
my
troth
hath
richly
catered
for
you
both
and
in
an
hour
would
you
repay
an
eight
years
work
away
i
alone
am
cling
to
him
the
poem
would
be
well
worth
quoting
here
in
full
but
is
somewhat
too
long
for
such
a
purpose
a
young
girl
of
eighteen

died
within

the
child
in

must
seemingly
have
been
the
beloved
infant
william
shelley
born
in
january
of
this
same
year
polidori
does
not
appear
to
have
vaccinated
the
boy
with
his
own
hand
for
i
find
in
a
letter
of
his
written
to
his
family
towards
june
got
a
gold
chain
and
a
seal
as
a
fee
from
an
englishman
here
for
having
his
child
inoculated
as
polidori
speaks
only
of
an
englishman
here
not
naming
shelley
it
looks
as
if
he
purposely
withheld
from
his
family
the
knowledge
that
he
had
come
into
contact
with
that
wicked
and
dangerous
character
i
wish
i
knew
what
has
become
of
the
gold
chain
and
seal
the
gift
of
shelley
but
i
could
not
on
enquiry
find
that
anything
whatever
was
known
about
them
by
my
then
surviving
relatives
i
possess
a
letter
on
the

the

near
from
the
villa
diodati
only
about
minutes
walk
shelley
and
the
two
ladies
had
entered
this
house
towards
the
end
of
may
prior
to
the
actual
settlement
of
lord
byron
in
the
villa
diodati
the
shelleys
as
we
have
more
than
once
heard
from
this
diary
kept
up
the
practice
of
drinking
beverage
always
cherished
by
percy
bysshe
the
topics
of
conversation
we
observe
were
following
on
from
what
shelley
had
on
the
previous
day
said
about
his
own
supposed
madness
while
at
eton
also
curran
whom
shelley
had
seen
a
little
but
without
any
sympathy
in
grattan
who
so
far
as
i
am
aware
was
not
personally
known
to
the
poet
to
pictet
on
english
day
about
diodati
house
then
to
see
shelley
who
with
shelley
came
over
went
in
the
evening
to
a
musical
society
of
about
ten
members
at
odier
who
read
a
very
interesting
memoir
upon
the
subject
of
whether
a
physician
should
in
any
case
tell
a
lover
the
health
of
the
lady
of
his
affections
or
anything
that
from
being
her
physician
comes
to
his
knowledge
afterwards
had
tea
and
politics
saw
there
a
gardner
whom
i
carried
home
in
the
calèche
odier
invited
me
for
every
wednesday
came
home
went
on
the
lake
with
shelley
and
lord
byron
who
quarrelled
with
me
this
might
seem
to
be
the
matter
to
which
professor
dowden
in
his
of
following
moore
of
and
some
other
authorities
thus
briefly
refers
towards
shelley
the
doctor
feeling
was
a
constantly
jealousy
i
can
not
say
that
the
diary
of
polidori
has
up
to
this
point
borne
the
least
trace
of
any
such
soreness
and
on
one
occasion
suffering
from
the
cruel
wrong
of
having
been
a
loser
in
a
he
went
so
far
as
to
send
shelley
a
challenge
which
was
received
with
a
fit
of
becoming
laughter
said
byron
though
shelley
has
some
scruples
about
duelling
i
have
none
and
shall
be
at
all
times
ready
to
take
his
place
professor
dowden
does
not
define
the
date
when
this
squabble
occurred
but
the
context
in
which
he
sets
it
suggests
a
date
anterior
to
june
when
byron
and
shelley
started
off
on
their
week
excursion
upon
the
lake
of
geneva
the
very
curt
narrative
of
polidori
does
not
however
indicate
any
nor
any
challenge
whether
sent
or
verbally
delivered
at
the
moment
and
perhaps
it
may
be
more
reasonable
to
suppose
that
this
present
quarrel
with
byron
was
a
different
affair
instance
when
polidori
happened
to
strike
byron
knee
with
an
oar
i
shall
recur
to
the
duelling
matter
farther
on
went
to
hentsch
about
diodati
thence
to
shelley
read
tasso
home
in
calèche
dined
with
them
in
the
public
room
walked
in
the
garden
then
dressed
and
to
odier
who
talked
with
me
about
somnambulism
was
at
last
seated
and
conversed
with
some
génevoises
so
fine
quantities
of
english
speaking
amongst
themselves
arms
by
their
sides
mouths
open
and
eyes
glowing
might
as
well
make
a
tour
of
the
isle
of
dogs
odier
gave
me
yesterday
many
articles
of
and
by
himself
and
a
manuscript
on
somnambulism
after
the
word
charlotte
polidori
has
put
some
other
word
evidently
intended
to
imitate
the
of
the
word
written
by
polidori
it
can
not
be
read
the
subject
of
somnambulism
was
one
which
had
engaged
polidori
attention
at
an
early
age
he
printed
in
a
medica
inauguralis
de
as
a
thesis
for
the
medical
degree
which
he
then
obtained
in
edinburgh
with
lord
byron
in
the
calèche
to
hentsch
where
we
got
the
paper
making
us
masters
of
diodati
for
six
months
to
november
for
louis
see
my
remarks
under
june
as
to
necker
house
and
the
rent
to
be
paid
up
to
november
would
be
barely
five
months
not
six
thence
to
shelley
back
dinner
to
shelley
in

driven
on

home
looked
over

saw
shelley
over
again
it
seems
rather
curious
that
polidori
living
so
near
shelley
should
now
have
had
occasion
to
write
to
him
ought
we
to
infer
that
the
challenge
was
now
at
last
sent
perhaps
so
and
perhaps
when
polidori
saw
shelley
over
again
the
poet
laughed
the
whole
foolish
matter
boatman
statement
that
napoleon
had
caused
him
to

i

that

shelley

came
in

talked
of
my

all
agreed
was
worth
nothing
afterwards
shelley
and
i
had
a
conversation
about
principles
man
was
to
be
thought
merely
an
instrument
the
accident
to
polidori
ankle
was
related
thus
by
byron
in
a
letter
addressed
from

to
john
murray
polidori
is
not
here
but
at

with

in

thomas
moore
in
his
of
supplies
some
details
shelley
was
after
a
shower
of
rain
walking
up
the
hill
to
diodati
when
byron
who
saw
her
from
his
balcony
where
he
was
standing
with
polidori
said
to
the
latter
you
who
wish
to
be
gallant
ought
to
jump
down
this
small
height
and
offer
your
arm
polidori
tried
to
do
so
but
the
ground
being
wet
his
foot
slipped
and
he
sprained
his
ankle
byron
helped
to
carry
him
in
and
after
he
was
laid
on
the
sofa
went
to
fetch
a
pillow
for
him
i
did
not
believe
you
had
so
much
feeling
was
ungracious
remark
the
play
written
by
polidori
which
received
so
little
commendation
was
i
suppose
the
which
is
mentioned
at
an
early
point
in
the
journal
there
was
another
named
in
prose
very
poor
stuff
and
i
suppose
written
at
an
early
date
a
different
drama
named
was
afterwards
published
certainly
its
as
a
drama
or
as
a
specimen
of
poetic
slender
the
conversation
between
shelley
and
polidori
about
principles
and
whether
man
was
to
be
thought
merely
an
instrument
appears
to
have
some
considerable
analogy
with
a
conversation
to
which
mary
shelley
and
professor
dowden
refer
and
which
raised
in
her
mind
a
train
of
thought
conducing
to
her
invention
of
frankenstein
and
his
mary
however
speaks
of
byron
not
polidori
as
the
person
who
conversed
with
shelley
on
that
occasion
professor
dowden
paraphrasing
some
remarks
made
by
mary
says
one
night
she
sat
listening
to
a
conversation
between
the
two
poets
at
diodati
what
was
the
nature
they
questioned
of
the
principle
of
life
would
it
ever
be
discovered
and
the
power
of
communicating
life
be
acquired
perhaps
a
corpse
would
be
reanimated
galvanism
had
given
token
of
such
things
that
night
mary
lay
sleepless
etc
up
shelley
came
and
dined
and
slept
here
with
s
helley
and
miss
clare
clairmont
wrote
another
letter
this
is
the
first
instance
in
which
the
name
of
miss
clairmont
is
given
correctly
by
polidori
but
it
may
be
presumed
that
he
had
several
days
back
found
out
that
she
was
not
properly
to
be
termed
miss
godwin
into
the
town
dined
with
shelley
etc
here
went
after
dinner
to
a
ball
at
madame
odier
where
i
was
introduced
to
princess
something
and
countess
potocka
poles
and
had
with
them
a
long
confab
attempted
to
dance
but
felt
such
horrid
pain
was
forced
to
stop
the
are
begun
by
all
but
me
this
date
serves
to
rectify
a
small
point
in
literary
history
we
all
know
that
the
party
at
of
byron
and
polidori
on
the
one
hand
and
of
shelley
and
shelley
and
miss
clairmont
on
the
to
write
each
of
them
an
independent
or
story
of
the
supernatural
the
result
being
byron
fragment
of
polidori
complete
story
of
and
shelley
renowned
shelley
and
miss
clairmont
proved
defaulters
it
used
to
be
said
that
matthew
gregory
lewis
author
of
had
been
mixed
up
in
the
same
project
but
this
is
a
mistake
for
lewis
only
reached
the
villa
diodati
towards
the
middle
of
august
professor
dowden
states
as
follows
during
a
few
days
of
ungenial
weather
which
confined
them
to
the
house
by
them
shelley
and
the
two
ladies
are
evidently
meant
and
perhaps
also
byron
and
polidori
some
volumes
of
ou
recueil
de
spectres
etc
a
collection
translated
into
french
from
the
german
fell
into
their
hands
and
its
perusal
probably
excited
and
overstrained
shelley
imagination
professor
dowden
then
proceeds
to
narrate
an
incident
connected
with
coleridge
of
which
more
anon
and
he
says
that
immediately
that
incident
byron
proposed
we
will
each
write
a
suggestion
to
which
the
others
assented
it
is
only
fair
to
observe
that
professor
dowden
account
corresponds
with
that
which
polidori
himself
supplied
in
the
proem
to
his
tale
of
but
polidori
diary
proves
that
this
is
not
absolutely
correct
the
prompted
by
the
a
poor
sort
of
book
had
already
been
begun
by
byron
shelley
shelley
and
miss
clairmont
not
later
than
june
whereas
the
incident
happened
on
june
byron
story
as
i
have
already
said
was
left
a
fragment
shelley
is
stated
to
have
been
some
tale
founded
on
his
own
early
farther
is
known
of
it
shelley
was
eventually
but
from
the
details
which
have
been
published
as
to
the
first
conception
of
this
work
we
must
assume
that
what
she
had
begun
by
june
was
something
different
of
miss
clairmont
story
no
sort
of
record
remains
the
countess
potocka
whom
polidori
mentions
was
a
lady
belonging
to
the
highest
polish
nobility
of
stanislaus
augustus
poniatowski
who
had
been
king
of
poland
up
to
she
was
daughter
of
count
tyszkiewicz
and
married
count
potocki
and
afterwards
count
wonsowicz
born
in
she
lived
on
to
when
she
died
in
paris
a
leader
of
society
under
the
second
empire
thus
she
was
forty
years
old
when
polidori
saw
her
she
wrote
memoirs
of
her
life
going
up
to
a
rather
entertaining
book
dealing
with
many
important
transactions
especially
of
the
period
of
napoleon
i
she
gives
one
to
understand
that
this
supreme
potentate
was
rather
susceptible
to
her
charms
but
a
rival
compatriot
the
countess
walewska
was
then
in
the
ascendant
i
have
seen
reproductions
from
two
portraits
of
the
countess
potocka
both
of
them
ascribed
to
angelica
kauffman
one
of
these
shows
a
strikingly
handsome
young
woman
with
dark
eyes
of
singular
brilliancy
and
sentiment
its
date
can
not
be
later
than
when
the
painter
died
and
may
probably
be
as
early
as
leg
much
worse
shelley
and
party
here
s
helley
called
me
her
brother
younger
began
my
after
tea
twelve
really
began
to
talk
ghostly
l
ord
b
yron
repeated
some
verses
of
coleridge
of
the
witch
breast
when
silence
ensued
and
shelley
suddenly
shrieking
and
putting
his
hands
to
his
head
ran
out
of
the
room
with
a
candle
threw
water
in
his
face
and
after
gave
him
ether
he
was
looking
at
s
helley
and
suddenly
thought
of
a
woman
he
had
heard
of
who
had
eyes
instead
of
nipples
which
taking
hold
of
his
mind
horrified
married
and
a
friend
of
his
liking
his
wife
he
tried
all
he
could
to
induce
her
to
love
him
in
turn
he
is
surrounded
by
friends
who
feed
upon
him
and
draw
upon
him
as
their
banker
once
having
hired
a
house
a
man
wanted
to
make
him
pay
more
and
came
trying
to
bully
him
and
at
last
challenged
him
shelley
refused
and
was
knocked
down
coolly
said
that
would
not
gain
him
his
object
and
was
knocked
down
called
some
of
these
statements
are
passing
strange
and
most
of
them
call
for
a
little
comment
first
we
hear
that
shelley
called
polidori
her
younger
designation
which
may
have
been
endearing
but
was
not
accurate
for
whereas
the
doctor
was
aged
at
this
date
shelley
was
aged
only
next
polidori
after
tea
began
his
this
according
to
shelley
was
a
tale
about
a
lady
who
was
so
punished
for
peeping
through
a
to
see
i
forget
something
very
shocking
and
wrong
of
course
so
says
shelley
but
polidori
own
statement
is
that
the
tale
which
he
at
first
began
was
the
one
published
under
the
title
of
which
contains
nothing
about
a
lady
some
details
are
given
in
my
introduction
afterwards
he
took
up
the
notion
of
a
vampyre
when
relinquished
by
byron
the
original
story
may
possibly
have
been
completed
in
at
any
rate
it
was
completed
at
some
time
and
published
in
soon
after
then
comes
the
incident
first
published
in
my
edition
of
shelley
poems
in
of
byron
repeating
some
lines
from
and
shelley
who
mixed
them
up
with
some
fantastic
idea
already
present
to
his
mind
decamping
with
a
shriek
the
lines
from
are
then
drawing
in
her
breath
aloud
like
one
that
shuddered
she
unbound
the
cincture
from
beneath
her
breast
her
silken
robe
and
inner
vest
dropped
to
her
feet
and
full
in
view
behold
her
bosom
and
half
her
side
hideous
deformed
and
pale
of
a
sight
to
dream
of
not
to
tell
and
she
is
to
sleep
by
christabel
from
this
incident
polidori
proceeds
to
three
statements
regarding
occurrences
in
shelley
life
it
may
be
presumed
that
he
had
heard
them
from
the
poet
in
the
course
of
this
same
evening
a
friend
of
his
liking
his
wife
he
tried
all
he
could
to
induce
her
to
love
him
in
turn
nothing
of
this
sort
appears
in
the
authenticated
facts
of
shelley
life
it
is
certain
that
very
soon
after
he
had
married
harriet
westbrook
in
he
saw
reason
for
thinking
that
his
friend
hogg
liked
his
wife
both
of
them
being
then
in
york
but
so
far
from
trying
all
he
could
to
induce
her
to
love
him
in
turn
he
at
once
took
her
away
from
york
to
keswick
and
he
addressed
letters
of
grave
remonstrance
and
sad
reproach
to
hogg
and
then
for
a
time
broke
off
all
intercourse
with
him
the
only
other
matter
one
knows
of
at
all
relevant
to
this
issue
is
that
shelley
alleged
that
afterwards
a
certain
major
ryan
carried
on
an
intrigue
with
harriet
he
blamed
and
resented
her
imputed
frailty
and
put
it
forward
as
a
principal
motive
for
his
separating
from
her
it
is
certainly
possible
that
after
the
separation
he
told
harriet
that
she
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
and
adhere
to
ryan
since
she
would
not
adhere
to
her
wedded
husband
but
no
indication
of
any
such
advice
on
his
part
appears
anywhere
else
be
it
understood
that
i
do
not
at
all
affirm
that
this
suspicion
or
statement
of
shelley
about
harriet
and
ryan
was
correct
i
doubt
it
extremely
though
not
venturing
summarily
to
reject
it
the
next
point
is
that
shelley
was
surrounded
by
friends
who
feed
upon
him
and
draw
upon
him
as
their
banker
this
probably
glances
at
godwin
and
perhaps
also
at
charles
clairmont
the
brother
of
clare
thomas
love
peacock
may
likewise
be
in
question
not
leigh
hunt
for
though
the
cap
might
have
fitted
him
in
and
after
the
year
it
did
not
so
in
the
present
year
since
hunt
was
as
yet
all
but
unknown
to
our
poet
last
comes
the
funny
statement
about
a
hectoring
landlord
who
twice
knocked
down
the
author
of
it
is
difficult
to
guess
what
this
allegation
may
refer
to
shelley
had
by
this
time
had
several
landlords
in
different
parts
of
the
united
kingdom
and
quite
possibly
some
of
them
thought
his
rent
unduly
low
or
more
especially
his
quarterly
or
other
instalments
irregularly
paid
but
who
can
have
been
the
landlord
who
took
the
law
so
decisively
into
his
own
hands
and
found
so
meekly
unresisting
a
tenant
i
have
no
idea
there
was
an
odd
incident
on
january
when
shelley
then
living
at
keswick
was
or
was
said
to
have
been
struck
down
senseless
on
the
threshold
of
his
by
a
couple
of
robbers
on
that
occasion
however
his
landlord
dare
appeared
in
the
character
of
a
guardian
angel
so
we
must
dismiss
any
notion
that
this
incident
the
one
which
in
some
of
its
features
seems
to
come
nearest
the
mark
is
that
which
shelley
so
ingenuously
imparted
to
polidori
worse
began
my
mr
s
helley
etc

here

the
expedition
of
byron

shelley
to

was
that
same
which
forms
so
prominent
an
incident
in
their
swiss
experiences
their
starting
upon
this
expedition
had
hitherto
been
dated
june
professor
dowden
has
expressed
a
doubt
whether
june
would
not
be
the
correct
date
and
here
we
find
that
so
it
is
to
town
apologized
to

walked

the
dates
hereabouts
become
somewhat
embarrassing
for
the
day
which
i
am
calling
june
polidori
repeats
june
and
he
continues
with
the
like
sequence
of
days
up
to
june
when
as
he
notes
he
found
lord
byron
and
shelley
returned
it
seems
to
be
an
established
fact
that
the
day
when
shelley
got
back
to
montalègre
was
july
he
has
stated
so
and
a
note
to
the
of
lord
states
the
same
thus
polidori
seems
to
have
dropped
two
days
one
is
accounted
for
by
substituting
june
for
june
and
i
shall
call
the
next
day
june
though
uncertain
as
to
where
the
second
error
occurs

does
it
mean
that

in
such
a
way
as
to
excite
observation

at

at

for

to

went

introduced
to
marchese
saporati
together
to
saladin
of
vaugeron
countess
breuss
calpnafur
and
then
to
a
party
of
ladies
the
word
which
i
give
as
calpnafur
is
dubious
in
charlotte
transcript
it
is
evidently
one
of
those
words
as
to
which
she
felt
uncertain
and
she
wrote
it
as
near
to
polidori
script
as
she
could
manage
the
other
three
saladin
and
not
elucidated
in
any
book
i
have
consulted
perhaps
saporati
ought
to
be
there
were
two
saladins
of
some
note
in
france
in
the
days
of
the
revolution
and
of
them
lived
on
to
but
i
can
scarcely
think
that
this
saladin
in
geneva
was
of
the
same
race
he
may
be
the
syndic
saladin
mentioned
farther
on
found
lord
byron
and
shelley
returned
all
day
in
the
evening
to
s
helley
written
my
journal
till
now
through
neglect
and
dissipation
had
a
long
explanation
with
s
helley
and
l
ord
b
yron
about
my
conduct
to
l
ord
b
yron
threatened
to
shoot
s
helley
one
day
on
the
water
horses
been
a
subject
of
quarrel
twice
berger
having
accused
me
of
laming
one
before
this
date
september
shelley
with
mary
and
miss
clairmont
had
finally
left
the
neighbourhood
of
geneva
they
started
on
august
upon
their
return
journey
to
england
the
statement
that
polidori
threatened
to
shoot
shelley
one
day
on
the
water
brings
us
back
again
to
that
question
of
which
i
spoke
under
the
date
of
june
about
some
quarrel
with
shelley
leading
to
a
challenge
for
a
duel
the
natural
inference
from
the
position
which
this
entry
occupies
in
polidori
diary
certainly
is
that
the
threat
to
shelley
occurred
at
some
date
between
july
and
august
at
the
earlier
date
of
june
and
so
i
presume
it
more
probably
did
we
find
also
that
conduct
in
relation
to
byron
was
considered
not
to
be
correct
and
this
formed
the
subject
of
a
long
explanation
not
only
with
byron
himself
but
likewise
with
shelley

it
will
be
observed
that
polidori
although
he
details
these
various
circumstances
likely
to
create
some
soreness
between
lord
byron
and
himself
does
not
here
state
in
express
terms
that
the
poet
had
parted
with
him
at
the
end
of
this
entry
for
september
he
does
however
give
a
few
words
to
the
subject
confirmatory
of
lord
ensuing
remarks
byron
in
a
spirit
gave
a
general
explanation
in
a
letter
addressed
to
john
murray
on
january
he
understood
that
polidori
was
about
to
return
to
england
to
go
to
the
brazils
on
a
medical
speculation
with
the
danish
consul
which
however
he
did
not
actually
do
and
byron
asked
murray
to
get
the
doctor
any
letters
of
recommendation
then
he
adds
he
understands
his
profession
well
and
has
no
want
of
general
talent
his
faults
are
the
faults
of
a
pardonable
vanity
and
youth
his
remaining
with
me
was
out
of
the
question
i
have
enough
to
do
to
manage
my
own
scrapes
and
as
precepts
without
example
are
not
the
most
gracious
homilies
i
thought
it
better
to
give
him
his
but
i
know
no
great
harm
of
him
and
some
good
he
is
clever
and
accomplished
knows
his
profession
by
all
accounts
well
and
is
honourable
in
his
dealings
and
not
at
all
malevolent
in
march
byron
made
a
few
other
observations
applicable
to
his
intercourse
with
polidori
the
sole
companion
of
my
journey
was
a
young
physician
who
had
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
and
having
seen
very
little
of
it
was
naturally
and
laudably
desirous
of
seeing
more
society
than
suited
my
present
habits
or
my
past
experience
i
therefore
presented
him
to
those
gentlemen
of
geneva
for
whom
i
had
letters
of
introduction
and
having
thus
seen
him
in
a
situation
to
make
his
own
way
retired
for
my
own
part
entirely
from
society
with
the
exception
of
one
english
family
shelley
and
his
two
ladies
at
times
however
byron
was
less
lenient
to
the
doctor
on
june
he
wrote
to
murray
i
never
was
much
more
disgusted
with
any
human
production
than
with
the
eternal
nonsense
and
and
emptiness
and
and
vanity
of
that
young
person
but
he
has
some
talent
and
is
a
man
of
honour
and
has
dispositions
of
amendment
in
which
he
has
been
aided
by
a
little
subsequent
experience
and
may
turn
out
well
it
may
be
hardly
needful
to
state
that
madame
de
broglie
and
monsieur
the
duc
victor
de
broglie
were
the
daughter
and
of
madame
de
staël
they
were
now
but
very
recently
wedded
february
byron
thought
the
youthful
wife
devoted
to
her
husband
and
said
nothing
was
more
pleasing
than
to
see
the
development
of
the
domestic
affections
in
a
very
young
woman
of
the
two
roccas
one
is
remembered
as
madame
de
staël
second
husband
he
was
a
very
handsome
officer
of
swiss
origin
they
married
privately
in

being
then
aged
about
and
he
he
only
survived
his
wife
about
six
months
dying
in

wilhelm

was
at
this
date
about
years
old
celebrated
as
a
translator
of
shakespear
and
calderon
and
as
a
scholar
of
extensive
range
he
had
travelled
much
with
madame
de
staël
who
drew
on
him
for
some
of
the
ideas
set
forth
in
her
book
monsignor

a
good

mentioned

was

this
little
specimen
suffices
to
show
that

had
no

the

rossi
an
italian
of
about
thirty
pleasant
agreeable
and
professor
at
bologna
thence
obliged
to
fly
with
two
others
one
of
his
companions
was
beginning
his
lecture
when
the
students
called
out
no
lecture
but
an
improvise
upon
the
liberty
of
italy
as
he
was
an
improvisatore
he
objected
as
on
account
of
murat
approach
it
might
be
suspicious
they
insisted
and
the
professors
at
hand
said
no
harm
if
not
upon
present
circumstances
he
did
it
and
the
students
issued
forth
to
join
murat
they
had
however
made
up
their
minds
to
do
so
before
rossi
joined
it
more
openly
and
loudly
and
was
obliged
to
fly
he
wrote
a
memoir
to
defend
himself
in
which
he
said
it
was
only
to
avoid
the
roman
dominion
and
give
it
to
the
archduke
who
told
him
that
he
had
better
write
another
as
bologna
was
already
ceded
to
pius
when
he
was
ruined
thus
partially
he
wrote
to
the
father
of
his
betrothed
to
say
that
he
must
not
if
he
chose
think
himself
bound
by
his
promise
as
he
was
not
in
the
same
circumstances
as
when
the
promise
was
given
the
father
did
retract
so
far
a
man
of
honour
now
how
to
reconcile
his
being
with

of

on

side
who
says
he
has
made
a
good
profession
to
him
and
at
the
same
time
professing
other
opinions
to
others
gave
me
a
letter
to
milan
and
by
him
i
have
been
introduced
to
saporiti

just
touch
my

with
all
the
force
of
my
leap
struck
him
with
my
fist
in
his
face
his
blow
fell
to
the
ground
and
with
his
hand
to
his
nose
he
retreated

then
seized
stones
to
throw
but
we
closed
with

not

looking

could

i
entered
a

where
they
expressed
great
astonishment
at
my
drinking
whey
which
they
give
to
their

only
refused
at

descended
towards

what
owing

and
hardly

sick
with

at

dined
and
finding

not
dance
slept
immediately
after
at
drank

at
set
off
passed
the
château
where
there
was
a
fair
after
that
hardly
met
a
soul
always
on
the
side
of
the
mountains
each
side
of
a
river
or
torrent
with
chalets
villages
without
a
visible
at
ups
and
downs
so
that
this
road
if
i
had
not
had
that
of
yesterday
i
should
have
called
the
worst
in

went
through

refused
my

went
to
the

who
charged
me
a

went
through

lauterbach
meiningen
to
thun
splendid
scenery
especially
the
first
look
at
the
lake
by
the
river
mouth
and
the
pass
into
a
great
valley
took
dinner
and
then
a

arrived
at
all
the
houses
are
of
wood
the
foundation
only
being
stone
great
cut
ornaments
between

the

fir
felt
very
miserable
especially
these
two
last
days
only
met
two
persons
to
whom
i
could
others
all
germans
at
wyssenbach
they
all
said
grace
before
breakfast
and
then
ate
out
of
the
same
dish
remarking
as
i
understood
them
that
i
not
being
a
catholic
would
laugh
it
was
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
polidori
was
not
a
catholic
he
was
brought
up
as
a
catholic
and
never
changed
his
religion
but
may
i
suppose
have
been
something
of
a
sceptic

at

we

farther
zio

my
uncle
luigi
polidori
also
at
pisa
bought
fresh
shoes
and
stockings
found
no
shop
the
man
at
the
made
a
good
reflection
that
he
was
astonished
so
many
came
to
see
what
they
who
were
so
near
never
want
to
see
and
that
he
supposed
that
the
english
also
leave
much
unseen
in
their
own
country
thun
is
a
neat
town
not
large
with
apparently
all
the
berne
towns
afraid
all
day
my
dog
was
poisoned
which
grieved
me
so
at
seeing
it
vomit
that
i
wept
at
went
in
search
of
a
boat
none
going
immediately
i
walked
along
the
left
bank
of
the
lake
to
unterseen
the
views
the
most
beautiful
i
ever
saw
through
pines
over
precipices
torrents
and
sleepers
and
the
fields
i
ever
saw
the
lake
sometimes
some
hundred
precipitous
feet
below
my
feet
at
other
times
quite
close
to
its
edge
boats
coming
from
the
fair
picturesque
towered
villages
fine

on
the
other
side
the
jungfrau
and
others
far
off
the
bottom
of
the
lake
is
especially
magnificent
lost
my
way
and
had
two
little
children
as
guides
back
again
one
small
cascade
of
seven
or
eight
fountains
arrived
at
at
unterseen
through
nilterfingen
oberhofen
rottingen
morlangen
neuchaus
to
unterseen
found
two
englishmen
at
supper
sat
down
with
them
very
miserable
all
the
morning
up
at
having
determined
to
go
with
the
two
to
the
grindenwald
in
a
on
account
of
the
state
of
my
foot
i
went
to
the
bridge
at
interlachen
to
see
the
view
coming
between
two
beautiful
isolated
crags
going
met
a
man
a
maréchal
who
had
been
to
vienna
and
bohemia
after
his
apprenticeship
to
see
the
a
day
at
one
place
a
day
at
another
returned
breakfasted
and
then
after
growling
at
the
innkeeper
wishing
us
to
take
two
horses
we
went
off
through
splendid
craggy
valleys
through
zweihitschirne
to
lauterbrunner
whence
to
the
fall
of
the
staubach
a
bare
cataract
of
feet
high
becoming
vapour
before
it
much
and
ending
in
a
little
stream
the
curate
of
this
village
receives
guests
there
were
the
prince
and
family
we
lunched
at
the
inn
and
went
back
to
lauterbrunner
after
having
looked
at
the
jungfrau
at
a
distance
went
from
zweihitschirne
to
the
grindenwald
with
the
before
us
through
a
more
beautiful
valley
saw
the
glaciers
come
into
it
with
the
eiger
wetterhorn
and
other
mountains
most
magnificent
walking
about
found
two
girls
who
gave
us
cherries
and
chatted
freely
found
that
mules
were
francs
a
day
a
party
came
in
in
the
dark
at
with
guides
hallooing
and
making
a
lively
sound
dined
at
and
talked
about
mules
hoping
to
get
return
ones
etc
up
could
not
get
mules
under
francs
my
foot
too
bad
to
walk
went
with
captain
rice
and
others
back
to
interlachen
got
into
a
boat
rowed
by
two
men
and
a
boy
went
by
brientz
calne
to
the
griesbach
cascade
and
then
to
but
not
so
beautiful
as
the
lake
of
thun
the
cascade
i
did
not
mount
to
see
on
account
of
my
foot
at
brientz
an
old
woman
would
give
us
her
presence
and
conversation
till
one
of
my
companions
courted
the
daughter
met
between
grindenwald
and
interlachen
l
ord
b
yron
and
h
obhouse
we
saluted
up
at
tired
of
my
company
and
finding
the
expense
more
than
i
could
afford
i
went
to
their
bedrooms
to
wish
them
set
off
at
and
through
fine
crags
along
the
aar
with
cascades
on
every
side
to
meyringen
where
i
breakfasted
with
two
germans
an
old
and
a
young
old
chatty
bought
a
pole
went
to
see
the
reichenbach
a
fine
cascade
indeed
thence
through
the
beautiful
vale
of
where
for
a
moment
i
planned
a
sovereignty
but
walking
on
my
plans
faded
before
i
arrived
at
guttannen
where
i
dined
rode
all
the
way
only
passable
for
men
and
mules
it
is
the
way
to
gothard
the
road
is
merely
huge
unequal
masses
of
granite
thrown
in
a
line
not
the
straightest
from
guttannen
the
road
went
through
the
wildest
and
most
sublime
scenery
i
ever
read
of
vegetation
less
and
less
so
that
instead
of
grass
there
was
moss
then
nothing
instead
of
trees
shrubs
then
granite
rocks
leaving
hardly
room
for
the
road
and
river
the
river
bed
the
most
magnificent
imaginable
cut
deep
and
narrow
into
the
solid
rock
sinuous
and
continually
accompanied
by
cascades
and
amazing
bold
and
high
bridges
snow
covering
in
some
parts
the
whole
bed
of
the
river
and
so
thick
and
strong
that
even
huge
stones
have
fallen
without
injuring
its
crust
there
are
only
two
houses
between
guttannen
and
the
hospital
one
a
chalet
wherein
i
entered
the
other
a
arrived
at
precisely
having
walked
in
only
hours
miles
at
least
this
is
a
little
indistinct
in
connexion
with
what
precedes
i
suppose
that
the
phrase
rode
all
the
way
must
be
understood
as
meaning
all
the
way
up
to
guttannen
and
that
after
leaving
guttannen
there
were
miles
of
walking
before
the
hospital
was
reached
yet
this
seems
an
unreasonably
heavy
day
work
in
travelling
after
only
the
initial
written
is
m
but
i
presume
it
ought
to
be
h
hours
the
hospital
is
an
old
stone
ugly
building
consonant
with
the
wild
scene
where
the
poor
are
lodged
for
nothing
others
us
as
an
inn
account
of
rain
did
not
get
up
till
set
off
across
the
grimsel
a
dreary
mountain
with
snow
in
every
feet
above
the
lake
descended
on
the
other
side
to
obergustellen
where
i
breakfasted
at
thence
through
verlican
guesquerman
munster
rexingen
biel
blizzen
where
out
of
the
dead
flat
valley
i
began
to
mount
and
the
scenery
began
to
increase
in
beauty
one
bridge
especially
over
the
rhone
which
fell
between
two
clefts
sides
was
beautiful
sinderwald
viesch
sax
along
the
rocks
and
fine
path
along
the
mountain
very
fine
though
continued
hard
rain
which
drenched
me
and
hindered
my
seeing
a
great
deal
to
morel
where
i
went
to
bed
and
ate
a
kind
of
dinner
in
bed
at
at
my
foot
from
having
been
obliged
to
walk
with
the
shoe
down
at
heel
very
much
swelled
and
too
painful
to
walk
breakfast
two
students
from
brieg
of
the
jesuits
college
came
in
who
had
during
the
vacations
been
beyond
constance
with
only
two
in
their
pockets
it
costs
them
ten
batsches
a
year
at
college
impudent
one
the
other
but
when
i
gave
him
six
francs
because
he
had
no
more
money
he
asked
me
for
more
on
other
accounts
the
jesuits
been
restored
two
years
at
brieg
i
sent
for
the
curate
a
good
old
man
of
sixty
we
conversed
together
in
latin
for
two
hours
not
at
all
troublesome
in
enquiries
but
kind
in
answering
them
the
valaisians
resisted
two
years
against
the
french
in
it
was
the
only
part
of
the
country
in
which
they
did
so
except
unterwalden
and
then
it
was
only
the
peasants
and
in
every
village
there
was
a
french
party
the
cruelty
of
the
french
was
dreadful
they
stuck
their
prisoners
in
a
variety
of
ways
like
sheep
one
old
man
of
eighty
who
had
never
left
his
house
but
whom
they
found
eating
they
strangled
and
then
put
meat
and
bottles
by
him
as
if
he
had
died
apoplectic
they
fought
very
hard
and
bravely
but
such
was
the
power
of
numbers
united
to
the
force
of
treachery
that
they
were
obliged
to
yield
in
after
the
french
had
quitted
brieg
they
again
attempted
to
penetrate
from
italy
by
the
simplon
when
the
brieg
kelor
and
other
villagers
joined
by
only
one
company
of
austrians
surrounded
them
in
the
night
and
took
them
prisoners
in
schwytz
and
unterwalden
the
division
was
more
strongly
marked
in
unterwalden
where
was
the
scene
the
men
divided
and
fought
against
each
other
some
joining
the
french
from
stanz
to
engelberg
they
were
for
freedom
and
fought
as
the
cause
deserved
they
killed
french
more
than
double
their
own
number
women
fought
they
were
in
all
swiss
one
maid
in
the
ranks
when
her
comrades
were
obliged
to
retreat
seeing
a
cannon
yet
unfired
went
with
a
and
fired
it
killing
thirty
french
she
was
taken
a
pardon
was
offered
she
said
i
do
not
acknowledge
any
pardon
my
action
is
not
pardonable
a
thief
one
pardons
not
a
just
man
they
killed
her
with
swords
the
hundred
men
who
came
from
the
higher
part
of
schwytz
attempting
to
go
to
their
relief
were
through
their
own
countrymen
forced
to
cut
their
way
and
march
by
night
and
when
in
retreating
they
came
to
the
other
shore
of
lucerne
lake
they
had
again
to
cut
through
their
own
countrymen
to
arrive
at
their
homes
they
refusing
them
permission
to
pass
the
austrians
for
the
help
the
higher
valaisians
gave
them
from
sovereigns
have
made
them
subjects
to
the
lower
valaisians
the
curate
came
in
again
with
a
description
of
the
simplon
sat
an
hour
and
a
half
then
left
the
book
when
he
was
not
here
i
have
written
the
part
of
my
journal
i
missed
at
the
time
and
the
extract
from
his
book
he
came
in
again
about
with
a
basket
of
prunes
for
me
and
offered
to
go
with
me
as
he
had
to
go
to
a
church
on
the
way
up
at
the
curate
came
and
my
foot
being
better
i
set
off
he
showed
me
the
bridge
over
the
massa
where
was
a
battle
and
the
ruins
of
a
tyrant
tower
we
came
to
his
church
where
he
showed
me
the
miraculous
figure
that
was
found
in
the
rhone
he
told
me
the
lower
valaisians
were
ready
to
join
the
french
in
and
that
in
spite
of
this
they
the
austrians
had
given
them
a
majority
of
voices
left
me
in
sight
of
brieg
telling
me
he
hoped
to
see
me
again
in
heaven
i
walked
on
to
brieg
breakfasted
and
then
set
off
along
the
simplon
a
magnificent
road
indeed
it
is
cut
in
many
places
through
the
rocks
in
others
built
up
to
its
side
it
has
caverns
and
bridges
always
wide
enough
for
four
carriages
it
ascends
all
the
way
to
the
new
hospice
and
again
descends
from
it
at
its
side
are
houses
of
refuge
as
they
are
called
where
many
are
kept
by
government
with
privilege
of
selling
food
to
help
the
there
is
in
each
a
room
with
a
bed
where
one
can
go
in
case
of
rain
accident
etc
and
when
the
time
for
avalanches
these
men
are
obliged
to
accompany
the
travellers
from
house
to
house
just
where
the
rising
ends
the
new
hospital
was
to
have
been
erected
and
is
half
done
but
stopped
now
a
little
farther
on
is
the
old
one
whither
i
went
and
got
a
dinner
in
the
cell
of
one
of
the
monks
bread
wine
cold
meat
and
nuts
he
seemed
very
his
words
slowly
fell
said
they
were
augustines
not
bernardites
that
bernard
was
a
mere
reformer
of
the
order
they
have
been
here
since
only
in
an
old
castle
for
which
they
pay
a
year
the
simplon
was
a
department
of
france
and
rather
well
off
on
account
of
the
quantity
of
work
and
money
and
not
having
the
revenues
the
archduke
regnier
was
there
a
few
days
ago
and
they
did
not
recognize
mortified
them
very
much
it
is
six
leagues
hither
from
brieg
so
that
i
had
walked
miles
i
set
off
at
passed
through
sempeln
and
through
the
most
magnificent
scenery
through
the
granite
galleries
the
italian
part
is
by
far
the
most
difficult
and
splendid
the
first
boy
that
i
met
before
coming
to
isella
in
answer
to
a
question
in
german
answered
non
capisco
i
could
have
hugged
i
arrived
after
much
difficulty
at
isella
knocked
up
i
was
ruined
in
my
feet
and
it
was
not
till
near
here
that
the
carriages
which
parted
in
the
morning
from
brieg
overtook
me
went
to
bed
immediately
in
a
room
where
the
grease
might
be
scraped
from
the
floor
not
get
up
till
on
account
of
fatigue
breakfasted
most
miserably
everything
being
bad
and
then
set
off
but
immensely
slowly
till
a
cart
overtook
me
entered
lay
upon
the
logs
of
wood
and
hay
and
was
driven
to
domo
is
it
imagination
only
that
i
find
the
sky
finer
the
country
where
cultivated
extremely
rich
the
dress
of
the
women
picturesque
blue
with
red
stripes
here
and
there
the
men
more
acute
and
arrived
at
domo
at
got
into
a
clean
though
poor
inn
and
dined
well
a
gendarme
came
in
to
ask
how
it
was
that
my
passport
had
not
been
viséd
yet
and
then
seeing
i
was
a
physician
requested
a
cure
for
his
toothache
it
is
useless
to
describe
the
picturesque
the
best
page
to
turn
to
for
it
is
the
memory
after
one
of
the
most
comfortable
i
have
had
since
i
left
geneva
i
went
to
bed
at
off
at
through
with
little
hills
here
and
there
starting
out
of
the
low
alps
highly
cultivated
with
beautiful
little
white
villas
at
their
tops
and
sides
asked
a
woman
what
was
a
house
whereon
was
painted
a
democritus
diogenes
etc
answered
è
roba
antica
evidently
modern
but
deserted
indeed
the
whole
of
the
houses
seem
too
large
for
the
falling
to
ruin
from
domo
went
to
vella
to
vagagna
where
i
breakfasted
and
saw
the
first
italian
girl
the
children
are
pretty
the
women
quite
otherwise
there
began
to
suffer
from
my
feet
so
much
as
that
to
go
about
six
more
miles
took
me
five
hours
no
car
passed
me
or
anything
i
arrived
at
last
at
ornavasco

get
no

they

six
rows
of
boxes

about
looking
at

entered
the
almost
so
black
and
dark
they
were
putting
up

for
friday

is
the
emperor

probably
the
same
as
for
napoleon
returned
home
arranged
my
papers
took
a
walk
on
the
corso
then
to
the
teatro
rè
the
same
price
for
all
the
places
the
piece
sogno
di
dream
of
ariosto
where
fortune
merit
orgoglio
with
disinganno
were
all
personified
the
dialogue
abounded
in
truths
especially
regarding
women
which
they
applauded
the
theatre
is
very
small
like
the
haymarket
home
to
bed
at
went
to
a
circulating
library
read
denina
all
the
part
on
italy
and
preface
to
the
teatro
scelto
di
milano
enquired
about
andricini
etc
for
my
found
andricini
is
clearly
written
in
the
transcript
before
me
i
am
not
aware
that
there
is
any
such
italian
author
as
andricini
and
apprehend
that
the
name
ought
to
be
andreini
this
author
wrote
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
dramatic
poem
entitled
which
was
indisputably
present
to
milton
mind
when
he
was
writing
polidori
father
who
translated
milton
was
probably
interested
in
this
work
of
andreini
went
to
the
teatro
rè
a
play
of
english
people
in
which
they
kiss
the
hand
and
make
more
bows
than
were
ever
made
in
a
century
in
england
there
were
german
soldiers
in
english
uniforms
present
home
to
bed
at
went
to
call
on
monsignore
him
received
me
with
two
kisses
and
great
apparent
joy
about
to
learn
english
i
promised
my
help
walked
with
me
and
invited
me
to
his
box
lord
byron
in
two
of
his
letters
october
and
november
remarks
regarding
milan
the
society
is
very
oddly
carried
the
theatre
and
the
theatre
only
which
answers
to
our
opera
people
meet
there
as
at
a
rout
but
in
very
small
circles
they
have
private
boxes
where
they
play
at
cards
or
talk
or
anything
else
but
except
at
the
cassino
there
are
no
open
houses
or
balls
etc
etc
left
home
read
denina
a
poor
book
went
to
guyler
met
with
him
went
to
dine
where
i
met
his
brother
who
told
me
the
physician
at
florence
was
dead
and
promised
to
come
and
take
me
to
the
hospital
met
after
dinner
abate
berlezi
the
crabule
came
home
read
the
of
bibiena
and
of
trissino
took
an
ice
and
went
to
la
scala
feast
of
francis
the
emperor
when
the
dukes
went
this
morning
to
mass
at
the
duomo
not
a
hat
moved
not
a
voice
of
applause
however
when
regnier
entered
there
was
a
slight
clapping
of
hands
the
theatre
was
lighted
up
like
an
english
one
and
was
magnificent
but
showed
what
the
italians
the
scene
does
not
improve
by
it
but
the
contrary
in
brema
loge
there
were
monti
brema
brother
and
others
monti
a
short
man
round
face
quick
eye
pleasant
in
conversation
not
haughty
modest
unassuming
seemed
to
take
great
pleasure
in
parts
of
the
music
and
in
the
dancing
it
will
be
understood
that
this
is
the
celebrated
vincenzo
monti
the
poet
who
was
at
one
time
acclaimed
as
the
legitimate
successor
of
dante
in
virtue
of
his
poem
upon
a
personage
of
the
french
revolution
in
monti
was
years
of
age
he
died
in
though
sufficiently
italian
in
his
tone
of
mind
and
sentiment
he
was
not
a
consistent
italian
patriot
but
was
eminently
susceptible
of
inflation
by
a
series
of
conflicting
revolution
napoleonism
and
even
austrianism
not
indeed
that
he
was
sordidly
in
his
various
gyrations
as
richard
garnett
has
said
he
was
no
interpreter
of
his
age
but
a
faithful
mirror
of
its
successive
phases
and
endowed
with
the
rare
gift
of
sublimity
to
a
degree
scarcely
equalled
by
any
contemporary
except
goethe
byron
and
shelley
brema
related
that
a
friend
of
his
porro
asked
for
a
passport
to
rome
refused
and
asked
for
documents
to
prove
his
business
gave
what
proved
he
had
business
at
maurata
and
relatives
at
rome
refused
went
to
swarrow
who
told
him
he
could
not
give
it
porro
said
why
do
the
austrians
think
the
italians
are
always
making
conspiracies
swarrow
said
that
they
did
not
know
but
now
that
they
had
the
upper
hand
they
cared
not
and
at
last
that
if
porro
would
give
his
word
of
honour
not
to
visit
any
of
the
foreign
embassies
he
should
have
a
passport
he
had
it
porro
was
not
a
revolutionist
but
had
always
been
against
napoleon
and
had
belonged
to
a
legislative
body
by
him
dissolved
on
account
of
obstinacy
brema
and
others
accompanied
me
as
far
as
the
door
and
i
went
to
bed
it
appears
in
the
sequel
that
there
were
two
austrian
governors
in
milan
at
this
and
for
civil
and
the
other
for
military
affairs
from
that
day
i
neglected
my
journal
till
this
day

at
milan
lasted
till
october
during
that
time
i
had
a
most
happy
and
pleasant

play
the
dinner
was
very
elegant
and
we
were
very
merry
talking
chiefly
of
literature
castlereagh
burghersh
etc
we
got
up
immediately
after
dinner
and
went
to
coffee
thence
most
to
the
theatre
de
brême
was
vicar
almoner
under
the
french
government
a
priest
came
to
him
to
ask
leave
to
confess
brême
knowing
the
subject
refused
the
princess
was
put
to
move
beauharnais
who
sent
for
brême
and
in
a
very
angry
mood
asked
him
why
he
had
refused
leave
b
rême
said
that
as
he
was
placed
to
give
leave
he
imagined
it
was
that
it
might
not
be
granted
indiscriminately
that
he
could
not
in
his
conscience
give
it
but
that
he
was
not
the
chief
and
the
almoner
being
applied
to
might
grant
it
b
eauharnais
asked
why
saying
that
the
princess
wished
it
and
it
must
be
done
de
b
rême
said
he
had
undertaken
the
office
under
the
idea
that
his
conscience
was
to
be
his
guide
if
not
the
office
should
be
immediately
vacant
that
he
put
it
to
beauharnais
himself
whether
a
man
who
was
buried
in
the
vilest
dissoluteness
was
a
proper
person
to
be
entrusted
with
the
care
of
young
women
minds
beauharnais
said
right
right
you
shall
hear
no
more
of
it
this
and
another
occasion
of
the
same
nature
were
the
only
occasions
in
which
he
saw
beauharnais
privately
he
avoided
the
court
and
did
not
seek
preferment
he
twice
under
that
government
refused
a
bishopric
and
under
the
new
government
giving
me
as
a
reason
that
it
went
against
his
conscience
to
inculcate
what
he
did
not
believe
and
to
add
power
to
those
who
gave
them
as
he
would
be
expected
to
side
with
them
he
is
violently
for
the
independence
of
italy
christianity
he
believes
not
and
gives
i
think
a
new
argument
why
we
should
not
be
holden
to
believe
it
saul
who
was
contemporary
who
beheld
the
miracles
did
not
believe
till
a
miracle
was
operated
upon
we
at
this
distance
can
not
believe
with
greater
facility
he
has
published
an
eulogium
of
caluro
del
giudizio
poems
etc
has
written
several
tragedies
made
me
weep
like
a
child
he
is
warm
in
his
affections
and
has
never
recovered
the
death
of
one
he
young
noble
lady
of
great
accomplishments
and
beauty
his
friendship
for
me
was
warm
it
gratifies
me
more
than
any
attentions
friendship
or
any
relation
i
had
before
with
my
i
can
not
express
what
i
feel
for
him
when
parting
from
him
i
wept
like
a
child
in
his
arms
he
maintains
from
principle
not
from
belief
all
the
hardships
imposed
upon
him
by
his
tonsure
he
would
have
the
world
to
see
that
his
belief
is
not
swayed
by
a
wish
to
escape
from
the
bonds
of
the
clerical
state
he
is
charitable
giving
away
great
sums
of
money
in
charity
eats
only
once
a
day
and
studies
all
day
till
the
hour
of
the
theatre

all
who
are
recommended

thousand

english

has
an
excellent

an
idea
of

i
have
promised
to

us
talk
no

on

beginning
gianni
was
an
apprentice
to
a
when
one
day
an
abate
going
into
the
shop
found
him
busily
engaged
in
reading
looking
at
the
book
he
asked
him
if
he
understood
it
he
said
yes
and
on
reading
showed
it
by
his
expression
the
abate
who
was
an
improvisatore
asked
him
to
see
him
next
morning
when
he
improvised
before
him
and
observed
that
the
young
gianni
seemed
as
if
his
mind
was
full
and
wished
to
give
forth
he
had
him
sent
to
school
and
introduced
him
gianni
in
the
revolution
taking
the
liberal
side
was
obliged
to
leave
rome
and
going
to
genoa
negri
heard
by
letter
of
it
and
went
to
seek
him
inviting
him
to
dine
with
him
he
refused
and
negri
who
had
promised
his
friends
that
he
would
be
of
the
party
at
the
hour
of
dinner
went
and
found
him
with
his
nightcap
on
deeply
reading
his
favourite
dante
and
in
a
manner
dragged
him
by
force
to
his
house
where
gianni
pleased
stayed
a
year
at
house
teaching
him
the
art
of
improvisation
gianni
improvisations
were
many
improvised
on
the
spot
by
an
abate
into
latin
came
to
brême
box
several
times
and
had
the
effect
of
making
all
except
brême
burst
with
laughter
me
he
sent
to
sleep
lord
byron
came
to
milan
and
i
saw
him
there
a
good
deal
he
received
me
kindly
and
corrected
the
english
of
my
essay
in
he
visited
a
good

was
with
him
colonel
finch
an
extremely
pleasant
clever
gentleman
spoke
italian
extremely
well
and
was
very
well
read
in
italian
literature
a
ward
of
his
gave
a
masquerade
in
london
upon
her
coming
of
age
she
gave
to
each
a
character
in
the
reign
of
queen
elizabeth
to
support
without
the
knowledge
of
each
other
and
received
them
in
a
saloon
in
proper
style
as
queen
elizabeth
he
mentioned
to
me
that
nelli
had
written
a
life
of
galileo
extremely
fair
which
if
he
had
money
by
him
he
would
buy
that
it
might
be
published
italy
they
dare
not
and
that
galileo
mss
were
in
dispute
so
that
the
heirs
will
not
part
with
them
they
contain
some
new
and
some
various
readings
finch
is
a
great
admirer
of
architecture
and
a
gentleman
most
peaceable
and
quiet
i
ever
saw
accompanying
finch
whose
only
occupation
is
when
he
arrives
at
a
town
or
other
place
to
set
about
sketching
and
then
colouring
so
that
he
has
perhaps
the
most
complete
collection
of
sketches
of
his
tour
possible
he
invited
me
taking
me
for
an
italian
in
case
i
went
to
england
to
see
him
and
hearing
i
was
english
he
pressed
me
much
was
the
physician
of
the
hospital
a
good
unimpostoring
physician
i
saw
under
him
a
case
of
pemphizus
and
had
under
my
care
an
hysterical
woman
jersey
lady
promised
to
enquire
of
her
mother
lady
westmorland
if
she
would
employ
me
as
her
physician
but
said
she
thought
my
having
been
with
lord
b
yron
a
great
objection
i
have
an
impression
not
a
secure
one
that
polidori
did
act
to
some
extent
as
lady
westmorland
medical
adviser
it
would
here
appear
that
her
ladyship
was
not
very
partial
to
byron
and
byron
must
have
repaid
her
dislike
for
i
find
in
a
letter
of
his
to
murray
november
that
polidori
was
in
the
way
of
receiving
the
patronage
of
frederic
north
the
most
illustrious
humbug
of
his
age
and
country
and
the
blessing
of
lady
westmorland

impulsive
arrogant
dictatorial
but
witty
and
brilliant
woman
lloyd
i
was
moving
in
the
pit
found
him
and
never
saw
a
person
so
glad
in
my
life
he
offered
me
half
of
the
money
he
had
at
his
banker
as
he
thought
i
must
be
much
embarrassed
told
me
brelaz
and
bertolini
seemed
to
be
together
and
that
the
man
seemed
worked
off
his
legs
my
life
at
milan
was
very
methodical
i
got
up
went
to
the
hospital
breakfasted
came
home
studied
dined
and
then
at
went
to
the
theatre
between
breakfast
and
study
went
to
de
brême
to
help
him
in
english
it
was
proposed
too
by
him
to
teach
english
which
i
had
intended
to
do
i
saw
only
the
dome
under
which
is
the
chapel
of
rich
in
silver
crystal
and
jewels
the
body
is
vested
in
pontificals
and
quite
dry
the
orbits
seem
only
filled
with
a
little
heap
of
black
dirt
and
the
skull
etc
is
black
there
is
here
the
gnometer
of
cassini
they
preserve
here
a
nail
of
the
cross
of

the
ancient
cathedral
it
was
at
the
gates
of
this
that
theodosius
was
refused
brera

and
the
ambrosian
where
i
saw
the

of

pieces

of
the
plautus

edited

there
are
beautiful
the
milanese
raphael
has
some
heads
expressing
such
mild
heavenly
meekness
as
is
scarcely
imagined
this
raphael
is
as
many
readers
will
know
the
or
espousal
of
the
virgin
mary
and
joseph
being
an
early
work
by
the
master
it
exhibits
in
its
mild
heavenly
meekness
more
of
the
style
of
perugino
than
of
that
which
became
distinctive
of
raphael
in
his
maturity
when
at
milan
i
spent
almost
all
my
money
in
books
buying
nearly
volumes
not
being
able
to
resist
that
thirst
for
printed
sheets
many
of
which
i
never
shall
read
swarrow
the
governor
of
milan
when
the
emperor
was
there
accompanying
him
to
the
theatre
saw
that
one
poor
man
in
the
pit
leaning
against
a
box
had
dared
to
keep
his
hat
on
violently
enraged
he
enters
the
box
without
leave
or
saying
a
word
and
leaning
over
the
box
with
all
his
orders
dangling
at
his
breast
applies
two
hearty
slaps
to
the
poor
man
cheeks
and
then
rising
majestically
leaves
the
box
and
goes
to
receive
the
despot
smile
this
making
a
great
hubbub
and
exciting
a
great
deal
of
ridicule
against
the
noble
he
insisted
with
the
that
not
a
word
more
should
be
allowed
to
be
said
when
at
milan
there
came
sgricci
a
tuscan
under
the
patronage
of
monti
who
puffed
him
most
egregiously
especially
his
tragic
i
accompanied
de
brême
to
casa
crivelli
where
i
saw
swarrow
and
a
cardinal
a
ganache
with
a
face
of
malice
that
had
dried
up
with
the
features
of
the
face
but
still
remained
sketched
there
in
pretty
forcible
lines
the
improvisator
entered
yellow
boots
with
trousers
blue
coat
and
a
flemish
collar
to
his
shirt
he
began
loves
of
psyche
and
commonplace
unpoetic
rhymes
a
tragedy
such
an
abominable
opiate
that
in
spite
of
my
pinching
myself
and
cavalier
brême
rousing
me
every
minute
i
found
myself
when
ended
roused
by
the
applause
from
a
pleasant
nap
heard
him
again
at
the
theatre
terza
rima
grief
of
the
only
bearable
parts
were
those
about
aurora
night
which
he
had
beforehand
prepared
to
at
convenience
from
the
ad
the
tragedy
being
drawn
out
first
came
death
of
he
came
forward
saying
that
this
subject
being
undramatizable
he
would
if
the
public
insisted
attempt
it
but
that
he
had
rather
another
might
be
drawn
came
out
oh
says
he
this
will
touch
your
passions
too
much
and
offend
many
probably
personally
the
public
here
stoutly
hissed
and
insisted
he
should
proceed
he
as
stoutly
called
on
the
boy
to
draw
which
he
did
and
there
coming
forth
and
he
was
satisfied
making
podrida
of
french
ragouts
italian
minestras
and
greek
black
soup
it
was
reported
that
monti
taking
him
up
was
by
the
persuasion
of
his
daughter
an
epigram
was
written
upon
sgricci
as
follows
in
questi
tempi
senza
onore
e
merto
lavora
sgricci
in
vano
ha
un
altro
il
serto
the
translation
of
this
couplet
in
these
times
without
honour
and
merit
sgricci
labours
in
man
wears
the
wreath
it
will
be
seen
that
the
epigram
if
such
it
can
be
considered
runs
in
favour
of
sgricci
he
was
a
native
of
arezzo
and
as
our
text
shows
a
renowned
improvisatore
i
happen
to
possess
a
printed
tragedy
of
his
which
is
notified
as
having
been
improvised
in
the
teatro
carignano
turin
on
june
shelley
in
january
attended
one
of
sgricci
improvisations
and
was
deeply
impressed
by
it
as
a
wonderful
effort
and
even
considered
in
itself
a
fine
poetic
success
in
being
entrusted
with
some
books
by
shelley
through
the
courtesy
of
his
son
the
late
baronet
i
read
a
tribute
of
some
length
which
the
great
english
poet
had
paid
to
the
italian
improvisatore
it
has
not
yet
been
published
and
is
included
i
suppose
among
the
shelley
mss
bequeathed
to
the
bodleian
library
the
subject
on
which
shelley
heard
sgricci
improvise
was
hector
ettore
one
rather
suspects
that
the
improvised
in
may
have
been
partly
reminiscent
of
its
predecessor
in
the
portrait
of
sgricci
a
man
of
some
years
of
age
appears
in
the
book
which
i
possess
it
shows
a
costume
of
the
that
polidori
speaks
of
i
have
looked
through
the
tragedy
and
do
not
concur
in
the
tone
of
ridicule
in
which
polidori
indulges
an
improvise
can
only
be
criticized
as
an
improvise
and
this
appears
to
me
a
very
fair
i
have
had
occasion
here
to
shelley
i
may
as
well
add
that
medwin
of
vol
i
says
that
the
poet
had
no
animosity
against
polidori
consequent
upon
any
past
collisions
shelley
i
have
often
heard
speak
of
polidori
but
without
any
feeling
of
going
one
evening
with
l
ord
b
yron
and
h
obhouse
to
b
rême
box
hobhouse
borsieri
and
myself
went
into
the
pit
standing
to
look
at
the
ballet
an
officer
in
a
came
and
placed
himself
completely
before
me
with
his
grenadier
hat
on
i
remarked
it
to
my
companions
guarda
a
colui
colla
sua
berretta
in
testa
i
believe
those
were
my
words
waiting
a
few
minutes
to
see
if
he
would
move
i
touched
him
and
said
vorrebbe
farmi
la
grazia
di
levarsi
il
cappello
vegga
he
turning
said
lo
vorreste
with
a
smile
of
insult
i
answered
sì
lo
voglio
he
then
asked
me
if
i
would
go
out
with
him
i
thinking
he
meant
for
a
duel
said
yes
with
pleasure
and
called
hobhouse
to
accompany
me
he
did
when
passing
by
the
he
said
go
in
go
in
there
i
said
i
would
not
that
it
was
not
there
i
thought
of
going
with
him
then
he
swore
in
german
and
drew
half
his
sabre
with
a
threatening
look
but
hobhouse
held
his
hand
the
police
on
guard
came
and
he
delivered
me
to
their
custody
i
entered
the
and
he
began
declaiming
about
the
insult
to
one
like
him
i
said
i
was
his
equal
and
being
in
the
theatre
to
any
one
there
equal
to
me
he
retorted
you
are
not
equal
to
the
last
of
the
austrian
soldiers
in
the
house
and
then
began
abusing
me
in
all
the
billingsgate
german
he
was
master
i
did
not
know
till
afterwards
in
the
meanwhile
the
news
had
spread
in
the
theatre
and
reached
de
brême
and
l
ord
byron
who
came
running
down
and
tried
to
get
me
away
but
could
not
on
any
plea
de
brême
heard
the
secretary
of
police
say
to
the
officer
do
you
meddle
with
this
leave
it
to
me
de
brême
said
he
would
go
to
bubna
immediately
and
get
an
order
for
my
dismission
on
which
the
officer
took
lord
byron
card
as
bail
that
i
would
appear
to
answer
for
my
conduct
on
the
morrow
then
i
was
released
next
morning
i
received
a
printed
order
from
the
police
to
attend
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
order
i
went
to
de
brême
who
accompanied
me
to
the
gate
i
entered
where
do
you
wish
your
passport
viséd
for
i
am
not
thinking
of
going
you
must
be
off
in
hours
for
florence
but
i
wish
for
more
time
you
must
be
off
in
that
time
or
you
will
have
something
disagreeable
happen
to
you
brême
upon
hearing
this
immediately
set
off
to
bubna
and
i
to
lord
byron
who
sent
hobhouse
in
company
of
colonel
mcsomething
to
swarrow
to
ask
that
i
might
not
be
obliged
to
go
they
went
swarrow
received
them
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
said
it
was
a
bagatelle
that
the
secretary
of
police
had
been
there
in
the
morning
and
that
he
had
told
him
of
it
that
it
was
nothing
that
i
should
find
myself
as
well
off
in
any
other
city
as
there
and
that
if
i
stayed
something
worse
might
happen
hobhouse
tried
to
speak
s
warrow
advanced
a
foot
give
my
compliments
to
lord
byron
am
sorry
i
was
not
at
home
when
he
called
but
if
this
is
so
mere
a
trifle
i
hope
lord
byron
is
well
advancing
another
foot
and
then
little
by
little
got
them
so
near
the
door
that
they
saw
it
was
useless
and
left
him
de
brême
in
the
meanwhile
had
been
to
bubna
bubna
received
him
very
politely
and
said
he
had
already
seen
colonel
who
had
explained
to
him
the
whole
and
that
for
the
mistake
of
speaking
to
the
officer
on
guard
he
thought
it
enough
that
i
had
been
put
under
arrest
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
and
am
glad
then
that
my
friend
will
not
have
to
leave
milan
what
do
you
mean
brême
explained
it
is
impossible
there
must
be
some
mistake
for
i
have
had
no
memorial
of
it
i
will
see
swarrow
this
evening
about
it
de
brême
mentioned
with
what
idea
i
had
left
the
theatre
bubna
said
that
german
soldiers
had
one
prejudice
less
and
at
the
theatre
in
the
evening
i
heard
many
instances
of
the
officers
of
the
austrian
army
acting
meanly
in
this
respect
amongst
others
bubna
son
being
challenged
for
insulting
a
lady
at
a
public
ball
accepted
the
challenge
but
said
there
were
several
things
he
had
to
settle
first
and
that
he
would
appoint
a
day
for
the
following
week
he
left
milan
the
saturday
before
a
young
italian
had
a
dispute
with
a
hussar
officer
and
challenged
him
for
which
he
was
brought
before
the
police
and
reprimanded
some
days
after
the
officer
standing
at
a
door
asked
him
if
he
wished
to
settle
the
affair
with
him
he
said
yes
and
they
immediately
entered
the
officer
spoke
to
several
of
his
companions
in
the
room
and
they
all
struck
the
young
man
and
pushed
him
out
he
could
get
no
redress
this
affair
of
polidori
shindy
in
the
theatre
excited
some
remark
his
feelings
in
favour
of
italy
and
italians
were
keen
as
he
was
himself
half
italian
by
blood
and
he
was
evidently
not
disinclined
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
an
austrian
military
man
he
was
indiscreet
and
indeed
wrong
in
asking
an
austrian
officer
on
guard
to
take
off
his
cap
and
although
he
addressed
the
officer
at
first
in
courteous
terms
his
expression
lo
voglio
was
not
to
be
brooked
even
by
a
civilian
lord
byron
mentioned
the
matter
in
a
letter
to
his
sister
november
as
follows
polidori
whom
i
parted
with
before
i
left
geneva
not
for
any
great
harm
but
because
he
was
always
in
squabbles
and
had
no
sort
of
conduct
contrived
at
milan
which
he
reached
before
me
to
get
into
a
quarrel
with
an
austrian
and
to
be
ordered
out
of
the
city
by
the
government
i
did
not
even
see
his
adventure
nor
had
anything
to
do
with
it
except
getting
him
out
of
arrest
and
trying
to
get
him
altogether
out
of
the
scrape
and
on
the
same
day
to
thomas
moore
on
arriving
at
milan
i
found
this
gentleman
in
very
good
society
where
he
prospered
for
some
weeks
but
at
length
in
the
theatre
he
quarrelled
with
an
austrian
officer
and
was
sent
out
by
the
government
in
hours
i
could
not
prevent
his
being
sent
off
which
indeed
he
partly
deserved
being
quite
in
the
wrong
and
having
begun
a
row
for
row
sake
he
is
not
a
bad
fellow
but
young
and
and
more
likely
to
incur
diseases
than
to
cure
them
beyle
likewise
has
left
an
account
of
the
affair
translated
thus
one
evening
in
the
middle
of
a
philosophical
argument
on
the
principle
of
utility
silvio
pellico
a
delightful
poet
came
in
breathless
haste
to
apprise
lord
byron
that
his
friend
and
physician
polidori
had
been
arrested
we
instantly
ran
to
the
it
turned
out
that
polidori
had
fancied
himself
incommoded
in
the
pit
by
the
fur
cap
of
the
officer
on
guard
and
had
requested
him
to
take
it
off
alleging
that
it
impeded
his
view
of
the
stage
the
poet
monti
had
accompanied
us
and
to
the
number
of
fifteen
or
twenty
we
surrounded
the
prisoner
every
one
spoke
at
once
polidori
was
beside
himself
with
passion
and
his
face
red
as
a
burning
coal
byron
though
he
too
was
in
a
violent
rage
was
on
the
contrary
pale
as
ashes
his
patrician
blood
boiled
as
he
reflected
on
the
slight
consideration
in
which
he
was
held
the
austrian
officer
ran
from
the
to
call
his
men
who
seized
their
arms
that
had
been
piled
on
the
outside
monti
idea
was
excellent
solamente
i
titolati
let
us
all
go
the
men
of
title
to
remain
de
brême
remained
with
the
marquis
di
sartirana
his
brother
count
confalonieri
and
lord
byron
these
gentlemen
having
written
their
names
and
titles
the
list
was
handed
to
the
officer
on
guard
who
instantly
forgot
the
insult
offered
to
his
fur
cap
and
allowed
polidori
to
leave
the
in
the
evening
however
the
doctor
received
an
order
to
quit
milan
within
hours
foaming
with
rage
he
swore
that
he
would
one
day
return
and
bestow
manual
castigation
on
the
governor
who
had
treated
him
with
so
little
respect
other
observation
of
beyle
regarding
polidori
and
byron
may
be
introduced
here
polidori
informed
us
that
byron
often
composed
a
hundred
verses
in
the
course
of
the
morning
on
his
return
from
the
theatre
in
the
evening
still
under
the
charm
of
the
music
to
which
he
had
listened
he
would
take
up
his
papers
and
reduce
his
hundred
verses
to
or
thirty
he
often
sat
up
all
night
in
the
ardour
of
composition

council
of
war
and
that
he
had
left
an
order
none

follow
him
i
took
leave

like
a
child

kindness
and
friendship

been
dear
to
me
i
took
leave
of

coach
with
only
louis
in
my
pocket
leaving
my
books
in
the
care
of
de
brême
and
left
milan
with
rage
and
grief
so
struggling
in
my
breast
that
tears
often
started
in
my
eyes
and
all
i
could
think
of
was
revenge
against
swarrow
and
the
officer
in
particular
and
a
hope
that
before
i
left
italy
there
might
be
a
rising
to
which
i
might
join
myself
i
arrived
at
lodi
wrote

up
my
things
paid
and
seeing
the
prussian
envied
me
my
desk
i
gave
it
him
on
condition
that
if
we
ever
met
again
he
would
paint
me
a
picture
he
sketched
in
my
album
went
to
pontelli
dined
accompanied
him
to
town
his
servant
took
a
porter
to
carry
my
things
to
the
arno
house
and
then
we
went
to
pay
visits
in
the
way
he
told
me
he
lived
very
retired
and
very
economically
that
he
might
not
want
that
the
people
now
looked
upon
him
with
a
good
eye
that
the
government
also
did
not
prosecute
him
and
that
he
in
fine
thought
that
a
revolution
would
be
to
persuade
me
that
his
avarice
was
mere
policy
went
to
pay
a
visit
to
cavalier
tomasi
a
cortonian
found
many
in
the
room
who
all
sat
upon
me
about
english
politics
left
them
when
they
were
going
to
play
thence
to
abate
fontani
librarian
of
the
riccardi
library
talked
of
madame
de
staël
finch
etc
returned
home
found
i
was
in
the
house
of
the
capponis
pontelli
having
the
lower
storey
at
dressed
in
black
silk
the
housekeeper
going
to
mass
and
pontelli
apparently
not
being
willing
that
i
should
accompany
her
i
went
out
a
little
after
and
went
to
the
same
church
where
i
spoke
with
her
looked
at
the
church
and
then
went
to
san
lorenzo
santo
spirito
santa
croce
where
i
saw
the
tomb
of
galileo
machiavelli
alfieri
cosmo
de
medici
etc
returned
and
went
with
a
letter
from
de
brême
to
the
countess
of
albany
found
there
several
presented
my
letter
very
like
your
father
the
countess
of
albany
it
need
hardly
be
said
was
the
widow
of
prince
charles
edward
stuart
the
young
pretender
born
in
princess
of
she
married
the
prince
in
being
much
by
him
she
left
him
and
maintained
a
practically
conjugal
relation
with
conte
vittorio
alfieri
the
famous
dramatic
poet
they
could
have
married
after
a
while
but
no
nuptial
ceremony
took
place
alfieri
died
in
and
the
countess
then
became
very
intimate
with
a
french
painter
much
younger
than
herself
named
fabre
she
died
in
florence
in
january
if
polidori
had
been
a
jacobite
he
would
have
held
that
in
waiting
upon
the
countess
of
albany
he
was
in
the
presence
of
the
queen
dowager
of
the
united
kingdom
of
great
britain
and
ireland
it
will
be
observed
that
the
countess
told
polidori
that
he
was
very
like
his
father
the
latter
had
from
to
been
secretary
to
the
conte
alfieri
and
had
known
the
countess
in
colmar
and
paris
in
one
of
his
privately
printed
books
he
has
left
on
record
a
little
anecdote
of
the
royal
dame
which
trifling
as
it
is
may
find
a
place
here
while
the
conte
alfieri
was
slowly
recovering
health
i
was
invited
to
pass
the
evenings
with
him
and
the
countess
so
that
on
various
occasions
i
terzo
tra
cotanto
but
this
honour
did
not
last
long
for
one
time
when
i
was
with
them
the
lady
turned
her
eyes
on
me
and
asked
alfieri
why
my
thighs
were
rounded
while
his
were
flat
and
nonsense
he
replied
wrinkling
his
nose
and
he
passed
on
to
some
different
talk
from
that
time
i
no
more
had
the
honour
of
being
one
of
the
exalted
party
neither
could
i
complain
of
this
for
i
myself
felt
that
that
question
had
been
unseemly
and
more
in
character
for
a
drab
than
for
a
discreet
and
modest
lady
conversation
became
general
republics
being
brought
upon
the
tapis
i
took
to
defending
them
especially
against
a
gentleman
near
me
after
some
time
he
went
and
i
gathered
he
was
brother
to
the
king
of
prussia
took
my
leave
and
came
to
dinner
after
going
to
the
caffè
to
wait
for
pontelli
rain
hindered
him
from
keeping
his
appointment
so
that
i
went
at
last
alone
to
san
gallo
he
having
the
custom
of
staying
the
sundays
only
in
town
was
presented
by
him
to
lecchini
the
inspector
of
police
who
recognized
me
as
a
tuscan
and
the
domiciliary
communication
was
made
out
as
such
to
stay
at
home
forced
by
pontelli
repeated
hints
to
go
out
jealous
of
his
young
housekeeper
though
she
is
hardly
worth
it
roamed
about
dined
and
went
to
bed
dined
with
him
at
a
restaurateur
up
at
tired

pontelli

somers
they
advised
me
to

however
determined
to
see
vaccà
first
wished
him
as

shelley
when

him
more
than
once
to

the

by
water
to
pisa
at
going
out
stopped
by
the
who
on
hearing
me
enquire
where

not
let

pass
without
proofs
of

being
so
i
went
to
lecchini
and
got

he
had
previously
made
a
copy
of
it
with
an
introduction
giving
a
few
one
statement
made
in
this
introduction
is
that
the
mother
of
agostino
was
a
florentine
lady
named
perhaps
so
says
gaetano
polidori
descended
from
an
english
family
domiciled
in
florence
which
may
have
changed
its
name

into
folchi
at
went
to
see
vaccà
still
at
hospital
while
waiting
for
him
saw
an
austrian
colonel
who
in
the
excess
of
his
gratitude
to
vaccà
called
him
the

expressed
great
joy
to
see
me
told

the

partly
very
unfavourable
account

pachiani
was
about
fifty
years
of
age
somewhat
above
the
common
height
with
a
figure
bony
and
angular
his
face
was
dark
as
that
of
a
moor
during
the
reign
of
austrian
despotism
he
was
admirably
calculated
for
a
spy
as
to
his
religion
it
was
about
on
a
par
with
that
of

il

the
title
by
which
he
was
generally
known
he
lost
his
professorship
by
an
irresistible
during
one
of
his
midnight
orgies
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
celebrating
with
some
of
the
most
dissolute
of
the
students
he
was
interrogated
in
the
darkness
by
the
patrole
in
the
streets
of
pisa
as
to
who
and
what
he
was
which
questioning
he
gave
the
following
reply
un
uomo
pubblico
in
una
strada

con
una

pubblica
his
epigrams
were
and
he
gave
sobriquets
the
most
happy
for
those
who
offended
him
his
talent
was
conversation
full
of
repartee
and
sparkling
with
wit
and
his
information
he
was
a
man
of
profound
erudition
vast
memory
and
talent
made
him
almost
oracular
he
was
a

may

the
doctor
fault
with
this
entry
we
come
to
the
end
of
polidori
as
i
have
before
intimated
not
by
any
means
to
the
end
of
his
sojourn
in
italy
he
saw
byron
again
in
april
in
venice
shelley
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
never
i
add
here
two
letters
which
polidori
wrote
to
his
sister
frances
my
mother
then
a
girl
of
only
sixteen
and
two
to
his
father
the
first
letter
was
written
soon
after
beginning
the
journey
with
byron
the
last
not
long
after
the
date
of
parting
from
him
i
also
add
a
letter
sent
to
hobhouse
during
polidori
sojourn
with
byron
and
a
note
of
much
later
date
written
by
shelley
to
my
father
gabriele
rossetti
the
letter
to
hobhouse
it
will
be
observed
goes
over
some
of
the
same
details
which
appear
in
the
diary
this
letter
has
been
copied
by
me
from
the
broughton
papers
in
the
manuscript
department
of
the
british
museum
add
mss
to
i
did
my
best
to
trace
whether
these
papers
contain
anything
else
relating
to
polidori
and
i
do
not
think
they
do
in
fact
the
affairs
of
lord
byron
and
the
very
name
of
him
scarcely
figure
in
those
broughton
papers
at
all
for
instance
i
could
not
find
anything
relating
to
his
death
john
polidori
to
frances
polidori
my
dear
fanny
i
shall
see
waterloo
in
a
day
or
you
wish
to
be
with
me
but
there
are
many
more
things
that
i
have
seen
which
would
have
given
you
as
much
pleasure
shakespear
cliff
at
dover
the
french
coast
the
phosphorescent
sea
bruges
ghent
antwerp
and
brussels
have
all
got
more
than
is
in
any
of
feinaigh
plates
to
excite
the
memory
to
bring
forth
its
hidden
stores
the
people
amongst
whom
we
are
at
present
dwelling
is
one
that
has
much
distinguished
itself
in
the
noblest
career
the
race
for
liberty
but
that
tends
little
to
the
ennobling
of
a
people
without
the
sun
of
literature
also
deigns
to
shine
upon
them
it
was
not
the
warlike
deeds
the
noble
actions
of
the
greeks
and
romans
or
modern
italians
that
has
rescued
these
names
from
the
effacing
daub
of
oblivion
if
it
had
not
been
for
their
poets
their
historians
their
philosophers
their
heroes
would
in
vain
have
struggled
for
fame
their
actions
would
have
been
recorded
in
the
dusty
legends
of
monks
and
consequently
have
been
forgotten
like
those
of
the
belgians
carthaginians
and
others
how
many
fine
actions
of
modern
times
will
be
buried
in
oblivion
from
the
same
want
and
how
many
merely
secondary
characters
will
be
handed
down
with
a
halo
round
their
deeds
reflected
from
the
pages
of
historic
genius
i
am
very
pleased
with
lord
byron
i
am
with
him
on
the
footing
of
an
equal
everything
alike
at
present
here
we
have
a
suite
of
rooms
between
us
i
have
my
at
one
end
he
at
the
other
he
has
not
shown
any
passion
though
we
have
had
nothing
but
a
series
of
mishaps
that
have
put
out
of
temper
though
they
have
not
ruffled
his
the
carriage
the
new
carriage
has
had
three
stoppages
we
are
at
present
at
brussels
merely
to
have
the
well
looked
at
and
repaired
the
country
till
here
has
been
one
continued
flat
and
except
within
this
neighbourhood
we
have
not
seen
a
rising
ground
on
which
to
feast
our
eyes
long
avenues
paved
in
the
middle
form
the
continued
appearance
of
our
roads
the
towns
are
magnificently
old
such
as
england
can
not
rival
and
the
state
of
cultivation
is
much
greater
than
in
england
indeed
we
have
not
seen
a
weed
or
a
foot
of
waste
ground
all
our
way
the
people
in
the
country
show
no
misery
the
cottages
comfortable
whitewashed
shining
with
brass
utensils
internally
and
only
having
as
many
heaps
of
dirt
as
there
are
certainly
throw
away
all
their
cleanliness
upon
the
house
fields
roads
and
windows
but
i
will
not
fill
my
letter
with
this
as
some
time
you
will
either
see
my
journal
in
writing
or
having
offered
me
guineas
for
it
through
lord

coblentz
dear
sir
as
we
are
at
last
some
way
on
our
journey
i
take
a
sheet
of
paper
up
in
despair
of
filling
it
to
tell
you
we
are
both
well
and
hearty
lord
byron
health
is
greatly
improved
his
stomach
returning
rapidly
to
its
natural
state
exercise
and
peace
of
mind
making
great
advances
towards
the
amendment
of
his
leave
little
for
medicine
to
patch
up
his
spirits
i
think
are
also
much
improved
he
blithely
carols
through
the
day
to
you
tom
brown
and
when
he
has
done
says
as
well
as
hobhouse
does
it
you
and
his
other
friend
scrope
davies
form
a
great
subject
of
conversation
god
here
i
am
at
the
end
of
all
my
thoughts
oh
no
waterloo
was
ridden
over
by
my
lord
on
a
cossack
horse
accompanied
by
myself
on
a
flemish
steed
lord
byron
singing
turkish
or
arnaout
and
your
h
umble
s
ervant
listening
we
had
a
very
good
day
of
it
lord
byron
visited
howard
i
think
colonel
twice
we
have
had
two
days
by
preëminence
in
our
and
waterloo
we
came
from
bonn
hither
through
the
finest
scenes
i
ever
saw
modern
and
ancient
the
and
century
forming
an
with
the
bases
given
in
the
year
towers
and
towns
and
castles
and
cots
were
sprinkled
on
the
side
of
a
but
here
i
am
on
poetic
stilts
cut
short
for
prose
ones
they
ministerialists
and
ours
being
the
happy
land
i
should
like
to
carry
john
bull
to
flanders
and
the
rhine
happiness
content
cleanliness
here
and
there
husbandry
plenty
without
luxury
are
here
bestowed
on
all
war
has
had
no
effect
upon
the
fields
and
even
at
waterloo
no
one
except
for
the
glittering
button
or
less
brilliant
cuirass
in
beggar
hand
would
imagine
two
such
myriaded
armies
had
met
there
no
sulkiness
is
seen
upon
the
face
here
and
no
impudence
on
the
rhine
and
in
flanders
there
are
hardly
any
beggars
we
had
nosegays
given
us
by
little
girls
for
centimes
but
the
other
day
coming
to
battice
we
met
the
best
beggars
three
little
girls
pretty
though
not
well
dressed
ran
along
our
carriage
crying
un
sou
monsieur
le
général
en
chef
and
another
chef
de
bataillon
having
given
these
some
a
boy
followed
pulling
faces
comic
enough
to
make
such
grave
dons
laugh
and
crying
out
vivent
messieurs
les
rois
des
un
sou
as
i
fear
i
have
tried
your
eyes
and
lost
my
pains
after
all
on
account
of
the
illegibility
of
my
accursed
pen
scratches
i
must
you
at
the
same
time
i
am
with
esteem
yours
polidori
we
count
upon
being
at
geneva
in
ten
days
at
best
excuse
the
bad
writing
for
i
am
in
a
fever
of
digestion
after
my
to
gaetano
polidori
my
dear
father
you
judged
right
with
regard
to
my
writing
i
had
written
twice
since
your
letter
announcing
and
was
anxiously
waiting
yours
your
letter
gave
me
pleasure
and
i
was
indeed
in
want
of
some
just
then
for
i
was
in
agitation
for
my
parting
from
lord
byron
we
have
parted
finding
that
our
tempers
did
not
agree
he
proposed
it
and
it
was
settled
there
was
no
immediate
cause
but
a
continued
series
of
slight
quarrels
i
believe
the
fault
if
any
has
been
on
my
part
i
am
not
accustomed
to
have
a
master
and
therefore
my
conduct
was
not
free
and
easy
i
found
on
settling
accounts
that
i
had
napoleons
i
therefore
determined
to
walk
over
italy
and
seeing
the
medical
establishments
see
if
there
proves
a
good
opportunity
to
settle
myself
so
that
i
hope
i
am
still
off
your
hands
for
nine
months
perhaps
lady
westmorland
who
is
at
rome
is
desirous
of
having
an
english
physician
for
longer
i
having
a
letter
for
her
from
mme
de
staël
i
shall
write
to
vaccà
and
zio
uncle
for
letters
to
milan
to
physicians
in
your
name
and
at
present
till
i
think
they
and
my
trunks
can
have
arrived
will
wander
amongst
the
alps
which
course
i
am
now
at
thun
almost
in
the
centre
i
have
seen
mont
blanc
and
its
glaciers
and
will
see
the
jungfrau
grindelwald
and
grimsel
then
i
will
go
by
the
simplon
to
milan
whither
direct
to
me
only
putting
my
giovanni
etc
names
in
full
as
there
are
polidoris
there
i
am
in
good
health
and
spirits
i
hope
this
wo
hurt
yours
for
assure
yourself
i
will
do
all
i
can
not
to
allow
you
to
feel
any
inconvenience
on
my
account
remember
me
to
my
mother
who
i
know
will
feel
deeply
this
disappointment
to
mary
fanny
and
charlotte
to
signor
deagostini
and
signor
de
ocheda
and
to
all
if
you
could
get
me
letters
of
introduction
they
would
be
of
great
use
in
the
meanwhile
my
dear
father
believe
me
your
affectionate
son
john
polidori
john
polidori
to
gaetano
arezzo
dear
father
i
fear
you
must
be
in
much
anxiety
at
not
having
heard
from
me
for
so
long
but
the
reason
was
that
i
did
not
wish
to
write
before
having
seen
my
whom
i
went
the
day
before
yesterday
and
who
received
me
with
great
affection
and
pleasure
i
wrote
to
him
from
thun
thence
i
went
to
grindelwald
and
lauterbrunner
thence
to
interlachen
and
by
the
lake
of
brientz
to
meyringen
by
the
grimsel
in
the
valais
to
obergasteln
thence
to
brieg
and
then
by
the
simplon
down
to
farinoli
in
the
borromean
islands
thence
i
embarked
to
sestri
calende
thence
to
meeting
the
poet
monti
lord
byron
monsignor
de
brême
and
others
of
my
acquaintance
i
remained
some
weeks
thence
i
went
to
florence
by
bologna
modena
parma
and
piacenza
and
crossing
the
apennines
in
florence
i
stayed
two
days
and
saw
cavalier
pontelli
abate
fontani
frosini
and
others
thence
i
went
on
foot
to
arezzo
where
i
found
my
uncle
my
aunt
pippo
and
teresa
all
well
and
they
received
me
with
great
cordiality
into
their
house
where
i
now
am
seeing
by
your
letter
to
my
uncle
in
how
much
trouble
you
are
on
my
account
i
have
determined
after
learning
whether
lady
westmorland
will
employ
me
or
yes
to
go
to
rome
if
no
to
go
straight
from
leghorn
to
london
to
the
bosom
of
my
family
i
shall
soon
hear
from
lady
westmorland
as
lady
jersey
undertook
at
the
instance
of
monsignor
de
brême
to
ask
her
mother
whether
she
wants
me
or
not
and
she
is
now
in
florence
for
rome
in
case
she
should
tell
me
yes
i
shall
at
once
go
to
rome
but
meanwhile
i
do
proceed
any
farther
than
arezzo
if
she
says
no
i
shall
be
off
to
leghorn
and
return
to
london
i
wish
that
in
your
next
letter
you
would
send
me
enough
money
in
a
bill
on
florence
for
paying
the
passage
from
leghorn
to
london
for
the
chance
of
my
not
having
enough
remaining
when
i
see
you
again
i
shall
have
much
to
tell
you
about
but
will
not
put
it
into
a
letter
suffice
it
that
i
have
found
that
what
you
told
me
about
italy
is
but
too
true
i
am
in
good
health
your
affectionate
son
john
polidori
to
this
letter
the
uncle
luigi
polidori
added
something
one
point
regarding
lord
byron
is
of
a
certain
interest
i
became
indignant
at
some
references
made
by
john
polidori
to
the
strange
conduct
of
that
lord
with
whom
he
was
travelling
but
kept
his
temper
envy
him
for
that
all
these
people
are
hard
sævus
enim
ferme
sensus
communis
in
illâ
my
father
about
the
date
of
this
ensuing
letter
met
shelley
several
times
and
he
liked
her
well
he
did
not
think
her
indeed
i
have
heard
him
say
era
brutta
she
was
ugly
letter
is
written
in
fairly
idiomatic
but
by
no
means
faultless
am
not
aware
whether
gaetano
polidori
supplied
shelley
with
information
such
as
she
asked
for
for
her
biography
of
alfieri
perhaps
a
minute
inspection
of
the
book
might
acted
in
was
alfieri
first
attempt
at
tragedy
harrow
courteous
signor
rossetti
thank
you
so
much
for
your
amiable
reply
and
the
interest
you
show
in
the
undertaking
of
a
pen
but
too
unworthy
of
those
great
names
which
give
so
much
lustre
to
your
country
meanwhile
i
am
about
to
make
a
farther
request
but
am
afraid
of
showing
myself
troublesome
and
beg
you
to
tell
me
your
opinion
sincerely
i
should
not
like
to
seem
to
take
impertinent
liberties
and
if
my
idea
appears
to
you
impracticable
do
say
anything
about
it
to
any
one
i
am
informed
that
your
the
celebrated
polidori
can
relate
many
interesting
circumstances
regarding
alfieri
the
life
which
i
am
writing
will
be
printed
in
lardner
therefore
it
is
very
short
running
perhaps
to
more
thus
if
i
could
introduce
some
details
not
yet
known
but
worthy
of
publication
i
should
be
very
pleased
indeed
i
do
know
whether
polidori
would
be
willing
to
give
me
such
details
for
example
i
should
like
to
know
whether
alfieri
was
really
so
melancholy
and
taciturn
as
is
said
by
sir
john
hobhouse
in
his
work
to
the
fourth
canto
of
childe
whether
he
gave
signs
of
attachment
to
his
friends
and
whether
he
was
warmly
loved
by
them
in
return
some
anecdotes
would
be
welcomed
by
me
also
some
information
about
the
countess
of
albany
there
is
an
affectation
of
silence
as
to
all
that
relates
to
her
in
whatever
has
yet
been
written
concerning
alfieri
but
now
that
she
is
dead
this
is
no
longer
necessary
were
they
married
if
not
nothing
need
be
said
about
it
but
if
they
were
it
would
be
well
to
affirm
as
much
i
shall
be
in
london
next
sunday
and
shall
be
staying
there
several
days
but
i
am
in
a
quarter
so
distant
from
yours
upper
eaton
street
grosvenor
place
that
it
would
be
indiscreet
to
ask
for
a
visit
from
much
more
indiscreet
to
say
that
if
signor
polidori
would
visit
me
he
could
perhaps
tell
me
some
little
things
more
easily
than
by
writing
as
the
tuscans
say
lascio
far
a
lei
you
will
do
whatever
is
most
fitting
and
will
give
me
a
reply
at
your
convenience
repeating
the
thanks
so
much
due
to
your
kindness
believe
me
your
much
obliged
servant
shelley
i
hear
that
alfieri
was
intimate
with
guiccioli
of
ravenna
the
latter
being
then
quite
young
and
they
had
a
joint
idea
and
project
which
did
not
turn
out
manageable
of
establishing
a
national
theatre
in
italy
possibly
signor
polidori
knows
about
this
is
there
any
historical
work
containing
particulars
about
the
closing
years
of
the
royal
husband
of
the
countess
of
albany
i
do
know
and
am
in
the
dark
he
is
it
not
so
was
the
last
of
the
stuarts
except
his
brother
the
cardinal
of
york
oh
what
trouble
i
am
giving
you
to
reply
really
i
now
feel
more
than
ashamed
of
it
but
you
are
so
kind
and
besides
the
grammar
of
this
letter
must
be
like
alfieri
footnotes
footnote
the
word
as
written
by
charlotte
polidori
seems
to
be
dole
rather
than
anything
else
it
looks
as
if
she
had
copied
the
form
of
polidori
word
without
understanding
what
it
was
i
substitute
door
but
this
is
done
de
footnote
such
is
the
word
written
by
charlotte
polidori
i
fancy
it
ought
to
be
late
footnote
only
an
initial
is
written
m
but
i
suppose
master
michael
meant
footnote
it
seems
rather
odd
that
polidori
should
make
this
jotting
and
not
towns
perhaps
he
aimed
to
controvert
the
phrase
scattered
cities
crowning
these
in
byron
poem
quoted
further
on
footnote
these
are
the
precise
words
as
they
stand
in
charlotte
transcript
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
polidori
wrote
them
some
while
after
may
footnote
i
do
understand
mayor
in
this
context
should
it
be
mylor
footnote
no
name
is
given
should
it
be
shelley
another
englishman
who
was
in
this
locality
towards
the
same
date
was
robert
southey
footnote
i
do
think
there
was
any
such
in
geneva
it
took
place
elsewhere
in
switzerland
footnote
the
word
written
is
perpanism
or
possibly
perhanism
is
there
any
such
word
medical
or
other
should
it
perchance
be
pyrrhonism

the

polidori
was
see
as
to
his
having
begun
in
the
first
instance
some
different
story
footnote
word
obscurely
written
footnote
blind
appears
to
be
the
word
written
it
seems
an
odd
i
suppose
to
blind
mislead
or
puzzle
the
auditors
footnote
this
again
is
not
clear
to
me
something
in
the
nature
of
a
game
of
forfeits
may
be
indicated

so
written
should
it
be
bingwen
or
something
of
the
kind
footnote
the
word
society
is
perfectly
clear
in
charlotte
transcript
from
the
context
i
question
whether
it
ought
not
to
be
shakespear
as
to
the
criticism
of
johnson
on
gray
in
the
of
the
many
of
my
readers
will
recollect
that
this
criticism
is
somewhat
adverse
gray
being
treated
as
a
rather
nebulous
writer
footnote
seems
rather
an
odd
phrase
but
i
suppose
correctly
transcribed
footnote
a
name
is
written
here
but
so
obscurely
that
i
leave
it
out
it
somewhat
resembles
neravois
or
the
ravois
footnote
should
this
be
glaciers
footnote
this
name
is
illegibly
written
i
can
only
suppose
that
it
must
be
meant
for
brieg
footnote
i
do
understand
footnote
it
an

orgoglio

footnote
there
is
a
word
following
rè
evidently
the
title
of
the
play
which
was
acted
it
looks
something
like
amondre
but
can
not
be
read
footnote
the
word
is
more
like
crabule
than
anything
else
i
do
understand
it
footnote
presumably
some
english
book
but
i
know
not
what
footnote
i
think
the
name
would
correctly
be
marchese
di
negro
my
father
had
some
correspondence
towards
with
the
then
marchese
of
that
family
footnote
this
essay
was
on
the
punishment
of
death
footnote
the
word
written
is
his
but
the
context
shows
that
this
must
be
a
mistake
footnote
artemisia

mausoleum

footnote
the
speeches
run
thus
look
at
that
man
with
his
cap
on
his
head
would
you
do
me
the
favour
of
taking
off
your
hat
so
that
i
may
see
would
you
wish
for
it
yes
i
wish
it
in
italian
this
last
phrase
has
an
imperative
tone
i
will
it
may
be
added
that
the
austrian
phrase
lo
vorreste
was
itself
not
civil
the
civil
form
would
have
been
lo
vorrebbe
ella
footnote
to
be
sold
footnote
these
words
form
i
the
answer
of
the
italian
he
would
side
with
either
party
indifferently
footnote
i
presume
that
the
word
should
be
presented
the
writing
looks
like
pented
footnote
what
a
servant
of
the
sovereign
there
are
porters
footnote
i
suppose
that
pontelli
was
a
person
who
had
been
more
or
less
known
to
polidori
father
before
the
latter
left
italy
in
and
that
the
father
had
given
his
son
some
letter
of
introduction
or
the
like
or
possibly
the
introduction
came
from
some
acquaintance
in
geneva
or
in
milan
footnote
the
name
of
santa
croce
is
not
in
the
but
it
ought
to
be
as
this
is
the
church
containing
the
sepulchral
monuments
of
galileo
etc
footnote
was
third
amid
so
much
intellect
the
phrase
is
adapted
from
a
line
in
dante
footnote
rather
it
must
be
understood
to
vaccà
footnote
ruffiano
does
not
correspond
to
our
word
ruffian
but
to
pimp
or
footnote
no
doubt
this
intention
was
not
carried
into
effect
footnote
these
polidoris
were
not
so
far
as
i
know
members
of
the
same
family
as
john
polidori
footnote
this
was
polidori
elder
sister
maria
margaret
who
in
my
time
was
invariably
called
margaret
