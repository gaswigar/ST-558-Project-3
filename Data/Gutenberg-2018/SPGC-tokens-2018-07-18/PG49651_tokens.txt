his

tedric
enters
into
battle
with
sarpedion
the
god
of
lomarr
in
this
story
of
science
and
adventure
which
marks
the
return
of
doc
smith
author
of
the
skylark
series
lensman
series
etc
critical
point
in
time
of
mankind
whole
existence
is
there
right
there
prime
physicist
skandos
slashed
his
red
pencil
across
the
black
trace
of
the
chronoviagram
why
must
man
be
so
stupid
anyone
with
three
brain
cells
working
should
know
that
for
the
strength
of
an
individual
he
should
be
fed
not
bled
that
for
the
strength
of
a
race
its
virgins
should
be
bred
not
sacrificed
to
propitiate
figmental
deities
and
it
would
be
so
easy
to
straighten
things
out
nowhere
in
all
reachable
time
does
any
other
one
man
occupy
such
a
tremendously
such
a
uniquely
position
easy
yes
his
assistant
furmin
agreed
is
shame
to
let
tedric
die
with
not
one
of
his
tremendous
potentialities
realized
it
would
be
easy
and
simple
to
have
him
discover
carburization
and
the
necessary
techniques
of
that
freak
meteorite
need
not
lie
there
unsmelted
for
another
seventy
years
however
simple
carburization
was
not
actually
discovered
until
two
generations
later
by
another
smith
in
another
nation
and
you
know
skandos
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
a
minor
interference
with
the
physical
events
of
the
past
any
such
however
is
bound
to
be
catastrophically
major
i
know
that
skandos
scowled
blackly
we
do
know
enough
about
time
we
do
know
what
would
happen
we
have
known
how
to
do
it
for
a
hundred
years
but
have
been
afraid
to
act
because
in
all
that
time
no
progress
whatever
has
been
made
on
the
theory
paused
then
went
on
savagely
but
which
is
better
to
have
our
entire
snapped
painlessly
out
of
existence
if
the
extremists
are
right
or
to
sit
helplessly
on
our
fat
rumps
wringing
our
hands
while
we
watch
civilization
build
up
to
its
own
total
destruction
by
bombs
look
at
the
slope
of
that
curve
ultimate
catastrophe
is
only
one
hundred
eighty
seven
years
away
the
council
would
not
permit
it
nor
would
the
know
that
too
that
is
why
i
am
not
going
to
ask
them
instead
i
am
asking
you
we
two
know
more
of
time
than
any
others
over
the
years
i
have
found
your
judgment
good
with
your
approval
i
will
act
now
without
it
we
will
continue
our
futile
testing
number
eight
hundred
eleven
is
running
now
i
believe
and
our
aimless
are
throwing
the
entire
weight
of
such
a
decision
me
one
sense
yes
in
another
only
half
since
i
have
already
be
tedric
awaken
the
lomarrian
ironmaster
woke
up
not
gradually
and
partially
like
one
of
our
soft
modern
urbanites
but
instantaneously
and
completely
as
does
the
mountain
at
one
instant
he
lay
completely
relaxed
sound
asleep
at
the
next
he
had
sprung
out
of
bed
seized
his
sword
and
leaped
across
the
room
head
thrown
back
hard
blue
eyes
keenly
alert
he
stood
there
poised
and
ready
beautifully
poised
upon
the
balls
of
both
feet
supremely
ready
to
throw
into
action
every
inch
of
his
every
pound
of
his
of
hard
meat
gristle
and
bone
so
standing
the
smith
stared
motionlessly
at
the
shimmering
almost
invisible
thing
hanging
motionless
in
the
air
of
his
room
and
at
its
equally
tenuous
occupant
i
approve
of
you
tedric
the
thing
apparition
whatever
it
was
did
not
speak
and
the
lomarrian
did
not
hear
the
words
formed
themselves
in
the
innermost
depths
of
his
brain
while
you
perhaps
are
a
little
frightened
you
are
and
have
been
completely
in
control
any
other
man
of
your
nation
yes
of
your
world
would
have
been
scared
out
of
what
few
wits
he
has
you
are
not
one
of
ours
lord
tedric
went
to
one
knee
he
knew
of
course
that
gods
and
devils
existed
and
while
this
was
the
first
time
that
a
god
had
sought
him
out
personally
he
had
heard
of
such
happenings
all
his
life
since
the
god
had
killed
him
instantly
he
probably
did
intend
to
right
away
at
least
hence
no
god
of
lomarr
approves
of
me
also
our
gods
are
solid
and
heavy
what
do
you
want
of
me
strange
god
i
not
a
god
if
you
could
get
through
this
grill
you
could
cut
off
my
head
with
your
sword
and
i
would
die
of
course
so
would
sar
tedric
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
the
word
i
see
it
is
dangerous
to
talk
very
even
though
a
man
is
alone
the
gods
and
hence
the
priests
who
serve
them
have
power
to
hear
then
the
man
lies
on
the
green
rock
and
loses
his
brain
liver
and
heart
you
will
not
be
overheard
i
have
power
enough
to
see
to
that
tedric
remained
silent
i
understand
your
doubt
think
then
that
will
do
just
as
well
what
is
it
that
you
are
trying
to
do
i
wonder
how
i
can
hear
when
there
is
no
sound
but
men
can
not
understand
the
powers
of
gods
i
am
trying
to
find
or
make
a
metal
that
is
very
hard
but
not
brittle
copper
is
no
good
i
can
not
harden
it
enough
my
soft
irons
are
too
soft
my
hard
irons
are
too
brittle
my
and
the
melts
to
which
i
added
various
flavorings
have
all
been
either
too
soft
or
too
brittle
or
both
i
gathered
that
such
was
your
problem
your
wrought
iron
is
beautiful
stuff
so
is
your
white
cast
iron
and
you
would
not
ordinarily
in
your
lifetime
come
to
know
anything
of
either
carburization
or
steel
to
say
nothing
of
both
i
know
exactly
what
you
want
and
i
can
show
you
exactly
how
to
make
it
you
can
lord
the
smith
eyes
flamed
and
you
will
that
is
why
i
have
come
to
you
but
whether
or
not
i
will
teach
you
depends
on
certain
matters
which
i
have
not
been
able
entirely
to
clarify
what
do
you
want
it
for
that
is
what
basically
is
your
aim
our
greatest
god
sarpedion
is
wrong
and
i
intend
to
kill
him
tedric
eyes
flamed
more
savagely
his
terrifically
muscled
body
tensed
wrong
in
what
way
in
every
way
in
the
intensity
of
his
emotion
the
smith
spoke
aloud
what
good
is
a
god
who
only
kills
and
injures
what
a
nation
needs
lord
is
people
working
together
and
not
afraid
how
can
we
of
lomarr
attain
comfort
and
happiness
if
more
die
each
year
than
are
born
we
are
too
few
all
of
us
except
the
priests
of
course
must
work
unendingly
to
obtain
only
the
necessities
of
life
this
bears
out
my
findings
if
you
make
steel
exactly
what
will
you
do
with
it
if
you
give
me
the
lord
i
will
make
of
it
a
sword
and
armor
a
sword
sharp
enough
and
strong
enough
to
cut
through
copper
or
iron
without
damage
armor
strong
enough
so
that
swords
of
copper
or
iron
can
not
cut
through
it
they
must
be
so
because
i
will
have
to
cut
my
way
alone
through
a
throng
of
armed
and
armored
mercenaries
and
priests
alone
why
because
i
can
not
call
in
help
can
not
let
anyone
know
my
goal
any
such
would
lie
on
the
green
stone
very
soon
they
suspect
me
perhaps
they
know
i
am
however
the
best
smith
in
all
lomarr
hence
they
have
slain
me
not
nor
will
they
until
i
have
found
what
i
seek
nor
then
if
by
the
favor
of
the
gods
or
by
favor
lord
the
metal
be
good
enough
it
will
be
but
there
a
lot
more
to
fighting
a
platoon
of
soldiers
than
armor
and
a
sword
my
optimistic
young
savage
that
the
metal
be
of
proof
is
all
i
ask
lord
the
smith
insisted
stubbornly
the
rest
of
it
lies
in
my
care
so
be
it
and
then
sarpedion
image
as
you
must
already
know
is
made
of
stone
wood
copper
and
gold
besides
the
jewels
of
course
i
take
his
brain
liver
and
heart
flood
them
with
oil
and
sacrifice
them
just
a
minute
sarpedion
is
not
alive
and
never
has
been
does
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
exist
you
just
said
yourself
that
his
image
was
made
of
stone
and
copper
and
do
be
silly
lord
or
art
testing
me
gods
are
spirits
bound
to
their
images
and
in
a
weaker
way
to
their
priests
by
linkages
of
spirit
force
life
force
it
could
be
called
when
those
links
are
broken
by
fire
and
sacrifice
the
god
may
not
exactly
die
but
he
can
do
no
more
of
harm
until
his
priests
have
made
a
new
image
and
spent
much
time
and
effort
in
building
up
new
linkages
one
point
now
settled
was
bothering
me
what
god
to
sacrifice
him
to
i
make
an
image
for
you
to
inhabit
lord
and
sacrifice
him
to
you
my
strange
new
god
you
will
be
my
only
god
as
long
as
i
live
what
is
your
name
lord
i
keep
on
calling
you
god
forever
my
name
is
skandos
s
sek
that
word
rides
ill
on
the
tongue
with
your
permission
lord
i
will
call
you
llosir
call
me
anything
you
like
except
a
god
i
am
a
god
you
are
being
ridiculous
lord
llosir
tedric
chided
what
a
man
sees
with
his
eyes
hears
with
his
ears
especially
what
a
man
hears
ears
as
i
hear
now
he
knows
with
certain
knowledge
to
be
the
truth
no
mere
man
could
possibly
do
what
you
have
done
to
say
naught
of
what
you
are
about
to
do
perhaps
not
an
ordinary
man
of
your
skandos
almost
said
time
but
caught
himself
of
your
culture
but
i
am
ordinary
enough
and
mortal
enough
in
my
own
well
that
could
be
said
of
all
gods
everywhere
the
smith
mien
was
quiet
and
unperturbed
his
thought
was
loaded
to
saturation
with
unshakable
conviction
skandos
gave
up
he
could
argue
for
a
week
he
knew
without
making
any
impression
whatever
upon
what
the
stubborn
tedric
knew
so
unalterably
to
be
the
truth
but
just
one
thing
lord
tedric
went
on
with
scarcely
a
break
have
i
made
it
clear
that
i
intend
to
stop
human
sacrifice
that
there
is
to
be
no
more
of
it
even
to
you
we
will
offer
you
anything
else
else
but
not
even
your
refusal
to
give
me
the
will
change
my
stand
on
that
good
see
to
it
that
nothing
ever
does
change
it
as
to
offerings
or
sacrifices
there
are
to
be
none
of
any
kind
i
do
not
need
i
do
not
want
will
not
any
such
that
is
final
act
accordingly
yes
lord
sarpedion
is
a
great
and
powerful
god
but
art
that
his
sacrifice
alone
will
establish
linkages
strong
enough
to
last
for
all
time
skandos
almost
started
to
argue
again
but
checked
himself
after
all
the
proposed
sacrifice
was
necessary
for
tedric
and
his
race
and
it
would
do
no
harm
sarpedion
will
be
enough
and
as
for
the
image
that
is
necessary
either
art
wrong
lord
without
image
and
temple
everyone
would
think
you
a
small
weak
god
which
thought
can
never
be
besides
the
image
might
make
it
easier
for
me
to
call
on
you
in
time
of
need
you
ca
call
me
even
if
i
could
receive
your
call
which
is
very
doubtful
i
would
answer
it
if
you
ever
see
me
or
hear
from
me
again
it
will
be
because
i
wish
it
not
you
skandos
intended
this
for
a
clincher
but
it
did
turn
out
that
way
wonderful
tedric
exclaimed
all
gods
act
that
way
in
spite
of
what
they
through
their
priests
say
i
am
overwhelmingly
glad
that
you
are
being
honest
with
me
hast
found
me
worthy
of
the
lord
llosir
yes
so
let
get
at
it
take
that
biggest
chunk
of
you
find
it
about
twice
your
weight
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
work
that
particular
piece
of
metal
lord
i
not
surprised
ordinary
meteorites
are
but
this
one
carries
two
additional
and
highly
unusual
elements
tungsten
and
vanadium
which
are
necessary
for
our
purpose
to
melt
it
you
have
to
run
your
fires
a
lot
hotter
you
also
have
to
have
a
carburizing
pot
and
willow
charcoal
and
metallurgical
coke
and
several
other
things
we
go
into
details
later
that
green
stone
from
which
altars
are
made
you
can
secure
some
of
it
any
amount
of
it
of
it
take
your
full
weight
and
of
the
black
ore
of
which
you
have
occasionally
used
a
little
of
your
weight
the
instructions
went
on
from
ore
to
finished
product
in
complete
detail
and
at
its
end
if
you
follow
these
directions
carefully
you
will
have
a
steel
to
be
exact
and
exactly
what
you
need
can
you
remember
them
all
i
can
lord
never
have
i
dared
write
anything
down
so
my
memory
is
good
every
quantity
you
have
given
me
every
temperature
and
step
and
process
and
item
they
are
all
completely
in
mind
i
go
then
i
thank
you
lord
llosir
the
lomarrian
bowed
his
head
and
when
he
straightened
up
his
incomprehensible
visitor
was
gone
tedric
went
back
to
bed
and
strangely
enough
was
almost
instantly
asleep
and
in
the
morning
after
his
customary
huge
breakfast
of
meat
and
bread
and
milk
he
went
to
his
sprawling
establishment
which
has
no
counterpart
in
modern
industry
and
called
his
foreman
and
his
men
together
before
they
began
the
day
work
a
strange
god
named
llosir
came
to
me
in
the
night
and
showed
me
how
to
make
better
iron
he
told
them
in
perfectly
fashion
so
stop
whatever
you
doing
and
tear
the
whole
top
off
of
the
big
furnace
i
tell
you
exactly
how
to
rebuild
it
the
program
as
outlined
by
skandos
went
along
without
a
hitch
until
the
heat
from
the
rebuilt
furnace
began
to
come
blisteringly
through
the
crude
shields
then
even
the
foreman
faithful
as
he
was
protested
against
such
temperatures
and
techniques
it
be
that
way
tedric
insisted
run
more
rods
across
from
there
to
there
to
hold
more
hides
and
blankets
you
four
men
fetch
water
throw
it
over
the
hides
and
blankets
and
him
who
turns
the
blower
take
shorter
tricks
in
the
hot
places
here
i
man
the
blower
myself
until
the
heat
wanes
somewhat
he
bent
his
mighty
back
to
the
crank
but
even
in
that
raging
inferno
of
heat
he
kept
on
talking
knowst
my
iron
sword
the
one
i
wear
with
rubies
in
the
hilt
he
asked
the
foreman
that
worthy
did
with
longing
to
buy
it
would
take
six
months
of
a
foreman
pay
this
furnace
must
stay
this
hot
all
day
and
all
of
tonight
and
there
are
other
things
as
bad
but
not
take
long
ten
days
should
see
the
end
of
it
actually
seven
days
was
the
schedule
but
tedric
did
not
want
the
priests
to
know
that
but
for
those
ten
days
matters
go
exactly
as
i
say
work
with
me
until
this
iron
is
made
and
i
give
you
that
sword
and
of
all
the
others
who
shirk
not
each
will
be
given
an
iron
sword
this
in
addition
to
your
regular
pay
dost
like
the
bargain
they
liked
it
then
during
the
hours
of
lull
in
which
there
was
nothing
much
to
do
except
keep
the
furious
fires
fed
tedric
worked
upon
the
image
of
his
god
while
the
lomarrian
was
neither
a
phidias
nor
a
praxiteles
he
was
one
of
the
finest
craftsmen
of
his
age
he
had
not
however
had
a
really
good
look
at
skandos
face
thus
the
head
of
the
image
although
it
was
a
remarkably
good
piece
of
sculpture
looked
more
like
that
of
tedric
foreman
than
like
that
of
the
real
skandos
and
with
the
head
any
resemblance
at
all
to
skandos
ceased
the
rest
of
the
real
skandos
was
altogether
too
small
and
too
pitifully
weak
to
be
acceptable
as
representative
of
any
lomarrian
god
hence
the
torso
and
limbs
of
the
gleaming
copper
statue
were
wider
thicker
longer
bigger
and
even
more
fantastically
muscled
than
were
tedric
own
also
the
figure
was
hollow
filled
with
sand
throughout
except
for
an
gray
sandstone
brain
and
hardwood
liver
and
heart
they
come
master
to
the
number
of
eleven
his
lookout
boy
came
running
with
news
at
of
the
seventh
day
one
priest
in
copper
ten
tarkians
in
iron
a
five
each
of
bowmen
and
spearmen
tedric
did
not
have
to
tell
the
boy
where
to
go
or
what
to
do
or
to
hurry
about
it
as
both
ran
for
the
ironmaster
armor
the
youngster
was
two
steps
in
the
lead
it
was
evident
too
that
he
had
served
as
squire
before
and
frequently
for
in
seconds
the
erstwhile
blacksmith
was
fully
clothed
in
iron
thus
it
was
an
armored
knight
leaning
negligently
upon
a
forging
hammer
who
waited
outside
the
shop
door
and
watched
his
eleven
visitors
approach
the
banner
was
that
of
a
priest
of
the
third
rank
good
they
worried
enough
about
him
yet
then
to
send
a
big
one
and
only
ten
mercenaries
small
short
men
of
tark
good
enough
fighters
for
their
weight
but
they
did
weigh
much
this
would
be
too
bad
the
group
came
up
to
within
a
few
paces
and
stopped
art
in
armor
smith
the
discomfited
priest
demanded
why
why
not
is
my
habit
to
greet
guests
in
apparel
of
their
own
choosing
there
was
a
brief
silence
then
to
what
do
i
owe
the
honor
of
this
visit
priest
he
asked
only
half
sarcastically
i
paid
as
i
have
always
paid
the
fraction
due
true
is
not
about
a
fraction
i
come
it
is
noised
that
a
strange
god
appeared
to
you
spoke
to
you
instructed
you
in
your
art
that
you
are
making
an
image
of
him
i
made
no
secret
of
any
of
these
things
i
hide
nothing
from
the
great
god
or
his
minions
nor
ever
have
i
have
nothing
to
hide
perhaps
such
conduct
is
very
unseemly
decidedly
ungodlike
he
should
not
have
appeared
to
you
but
to
one
of
us
and
in
the
temple
it
is
certainly
all
that
sarpedion
has
ever
done
for
me
is
let
me
alone
and
i
have
paid
heavily
for
that
what
bargain
did
you
make
with
this
llosir
what
was
the
price
no
bargain
was
made
i
thought
it
strange
but
who
am
i
an
ordinary
man
to
try
to
understand
the
actions
or
the
reasonings
of
a
god
there
will
be
a
price
i
suppose
whatever
it
is
i
will
pay
it
gladly
you
will
pay
rest
assured
not
to
this
llosir
but
to
great
sarpedion
i
command
you
to
destroy
that
image
forthwith
you
do
why
since
when
has
it
been
against
the
law
to
have
a
personal
god
most
families
of
lomarr
have
them
not
like
yours
sarpedion
does
not
permit
your
llosir
to
exist
sarpedion
has
nothing
to
say
about
it
llosir
already
exists
is
the
great
god
so
weak
so
afraid
so
unable
to
defend
himself
against
a
stranger
that
he
take
care
smith
silence
that
is
rankest
blasphemy
perhaps
but
i
have
blasphemed
before
and
sarpedion
has
killed
me
yet
nor
will
he
methinks
at
least
until
his
priests
have
collected
his
fraction
of
the
finest
iron
ever
forged
and
which
i
only
can
make
oh
yes
the
new
iron
tell
me
exactly
how
it
is
made
you
know
better
than
to
ask
that
question
priest
that
secret
will
be
known
only
to
me
and
my
god
we
have
equipment
and
tools
designed
specifically
for
getting
information
out
of
such
as
you
seize
him
men
and
smash
that
image
hold
tedric
roared
in
such
a
voice
that
not
a
man
moved
if
anybody
takes
one
forward
step
priest
or
makes
one
move
toward
spear
or
arrow
your
brains
will
spatter
the
walls
across
the
street
can
your
copper
helmet
stop
this
hammer
can
your
priest
body
move
fast
enough
to
dodge
my
blow
and
most
or
all
of
those
runty
little
slavelings
behind
you
waving
his
left
arm
contemptuously
at
the
group
will
also
die
before
they
cut
me
down
and
if
i
die
now
of
what
worth
is
sarpedion
fraction
of
a
metal
that
will
never
be
made
think
well
priest
sarpedion
agent
studied
the
truculent
glaring
ironmaster
for
a
long
two
minutes
then
deciding
that
the
proposed
victim
could
not
be
taken
alive
he
led
his
crew
back
the
way
they
had
come
trailing
fiery
threats
and
tedric
going
back
into
his
shop
was
thoroughly
aware
that
those
threats
were
not
idle
so
far
he
had
taken
too
much
risk
but
the
next
visit
would
be
different
very
different
he
was
exceedingly
glad
that
none
of
his
men
knew
that
the
pots
they
were
firing
so
fiercely
were
in
fact
filled
only
with
coke
and
willow
charcoal
that
armor
and
sword
and
shield
and
axe
and
hammer
were
at
that
moment
getting
their
final
heat
treatment
in
a
bath
of
oil
but
little
hotter
than
boiling
water
in
the
sanctum
to
which
he
retired
always
alone
to
perform
the
incantations
which
his
men
and
hence
the
priests
of
sarpedion
believed
as
necessary
as
any
other
part
of
the
metallurgical
process
that
evening
he
selected
a
smooth
stone
and
whetted
the
already
almost
perfect
cutting
edge
of
his
new
sword
an
edge
which
in
was
rather
more
like
an
extremely
sharp
than
a
razor
he
fitted
the
grip
meticulously
with
worked
and
tempered
rawhide
thrilling
again
and
again
as
each
touch
of
an
educated
and
talented
told
him
over
and
over
that
here
was
some
thing
brand
new
in
metal
a
real
a
piece
of
flat
wrought
iron
about
by
five
inches
and
about
a
foot
long
already
lay
on
a
smooth
and
heavy
hardwood
block
he
tapped
it
sharply
with
the
sword
edge
the
blade
rang
like
a
bell
the
iron
showed
a
bright
new
scar
that
was
all
then
a
moderately
heavy
blow
about
as
hard
as
he
had
ever
dared
swing
an
iron
sword
still
no
damage
then
heart
in
mouth
he
gave
the
its
final
test
struck
with
everything
he
had
from
heels
and
toes
to
he
had
never
struck
such
a
blow
before
except
possibly
with
a
or
a
sledge
there
was
a
ringing
clang
two
sundered
slabs
of
iron
flew
to
opposite
ends
of
the
room
the
atrocious
blade
went
on
half
an
inch
deep
into
solid
oak
he
wrenched
the
weapon
free
and
stared
at
the
unmarred
edge
unmarred
for
an
instant
tedric
felt
as
though
he
were
about
to
collapse
but
sheerest
joy
does
not
disable
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
except
make
the
links
and
so
on
for
his
armor
which
did
not
take
long
hence
when
the
minions
of
sarpedion
next
appeared
armored
this
time
in
the
heaviest
and
best
iron
they
had
and
all
set
to
overwhelm
him
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
he
was
completely
ready
nor
was
there
palaver
or
parley
the
attackers
opened
the
door
saw
the
smith
and
rushed
but
tedric
although
in
plain
sight
had
chosen
the
battleground
with
care
he
was
in
a
corner
at
his
back
a
stairway
ran
up
to
the
second
floor
on
his
right
the
wall
was
solid
for
twenty
feet
on
his
left
beyond
the
stairwell
the
wall
was
equally
solid
for
twice
as
far
they
would
have
to
come
after
him
and
as
he
retreated
they
would
be
fighting
their
way
up
and
not
more
than
two
at
a
time
this
first
swing
horizontal
and
was
fully
as
as
the
one
that
had
cloven
the
and
almost
ruined
his
the
blade
scarcely
slowed
as
it
went
through
armor
and
flesh
and
bone
in
fact
the
helmet
and
the
head
within
it
remained
in
place
upon
the
shoulders
for
what
seemed
like
seconds
before
the
body
toppled
and
the
arteries
spurted
crimson
jets
he
did
have
to
hit
so
hard
then
good
nobody
could
last
very
long
the
way
he
had
started
out
wherefore
the
next
blow
a
vertical
chop
merely
split
a
man
to
the
chin
instead
of
to
the
navel
and
the
third
a
return
did
quite
cut
the
victim
head
clear
off
and
the
blows
his
steel
was
taking
aimed
at
head
or
neck
or
shoulder
were
doing
no
harm
at
all
in
fact
except
for
the
noise
they
scarcely
bothered
him
he
had
been
designing
and
building
armor
for
five
years
and
this
was
his
masterpiece
the
helmet
was
heavily
padded
the
shoulders
twice
as
much
so
he
had
sacrificed
some
mobility
he
could
not
turn
his
head
very
far
in
either
direction
but
the
jointing
was
such
that
the
force
of
any
blow
on
the
helmet
from
whatever
direction
coming
was
taken
by
his
tremendously
capable
shoulders
the
weapons
of
the
mercenaries
could
not
dent
could
not
even
nick
that
steel
swords
bent
broke
twisted
hammers
and
axes
bounced
harmlessly
off
nevertheless
the
attackers
pressed
forward
and
even
though
each
blow
of
his
devastating
sword
took
a
life
tedric
was
forced
backward
up
the
stairs
step
by
step
then
there
came
about
that
for
which
he
had
been
waiting
a
priest
appeared
behind
the
last
rank
of
mercenaries
staring
upward
at
something
behind
the
ironmaster
beckoning
frantically
the
priest
had
split
his
forces
had
sent
part
of
them
by
another
way
to
the
second
floor
to
trap
him
between
two
groups
had
come
in
close
to
see
the
trap
sprung
this
was
it
taking
a
couple
of
quick
upward
backward
steps
he
launched
himself
into
the
air
with
all
the
power
of
his
legs
and
when
two
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
of
man
dressed
in
eighty
or
ninety
or
a
hundred
pounds
of
steel
leaps
from
a
height
of
eight
or
ten
feet
upon
a
group
of
other
men
those
other
men
go
down
righting
himself
quickly
tedric
sprang
toward
the
priest
and
swung
swung
with
all
the
momentum
of
his
mass
and
speed
and
all
the
power
of
his
giant
frame
swung
as
though
he
were
concentrating
into
the
blow
all
his
hatred
of
sarpedion
and
everything
for
which
sarpedion
stood
which
in
fact
he
was
and
what
such
a
so
driven
did
to
thin
showy
copper
armor
and
to
the
human
flesh
beneath
it
is
simply
nothing
to
dwell
upon
here
hold
he
roared
at
the
mercenaries
who
had
quite
decided
whether
or
not
to
resume
the
attack
and
they
held
bu
bub
but
you
dead
the
stuttered
you
be
the
great
sarpedion
would
a
right
lively
corpse
i
tedric
snarled
your
sarpedion
false
god
and
coward
drinker
of
blood
and
slayer
of
the
helpless
is
weak
puny
and
futile
beside
my
llosir
hence
under
llosir
shield
and
at
llosir
direction
i
shall
this
day
kill
your
foul
and
depraved
god
shall
send
him
back
to
the
grisly
hell
from
whence
he
came
nor
do
i
ask
you
to
fight
for
me
nor
would
i
so
allow
for
i
trust
you
not
though
you
swore
by
all
your
gods
do
you
fight
for
pleasure
or
for
pay
a
growl
was
the
only
answer
but
that
was
answer
enough
he
of
sarpedion
who
paid
your
wages
lies
there
dead
all
others
of
his
ilk
will
die
ere
this
day
sunset
be
advised
therefore
fight
no
more
until
you
know
who
pays
wouldst
any
more
of
you
be
split
like
ere
i
go
time
runneth
short
but
i
would
stay
and
oblige
if
pressed
he
was
not
pressed
tedric
whirled
and
strode
away
should
he
get
his
horse
or
not
no
he
had
never
ridden
mighty
dreegor
into
danger
wearing
armor
less
capable
than
his
own
and
he
would
begin
now
the
temple
of
sarpedion
was
a
tall
narrow
building
with
a
outside
staircase
leading
up
to
the
excrescence
in
which
the
green
altar
of
sacrifice
was
tedric
reached
the
foot
of
that
staircase
and
grimly
doggedly
cut
his
way
up
it
it
was
hard
work
and
he
did
not
want
to
wear
himself
out
too
soon
he
might
need
a
lot
and
suddenly
later
on
and
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
have
something
in
reserve
as
he
mounted
higher
and
higher
however
the
opposition
became
less
and
less
instead
of
greater
and
greater
as
he
had
expected
priests
were
no
longer
there
he
had
seen
one
for
five
minutes
and
in
the
penthouse
itself
instead
of
the
solid
phalanx
of
opposition
he
had
would
bar
his
way
there
were
only
half
a
dozen
mercenaries
who
promptly
turned
tail
and
ran
the
way
is
clear
hasten
tedric
shouted
and
his
youthful
squire
rushed
up
the
ramp
with
his
axe
and
hammer
and
with
those
implements
tedric
mauled
and
chopped
the
image
of
the
god
devann
sarpedion
high
priest
was
desperate
he
believed
thoroughly
in
his
god
equally
thoroughly
however
he
believed
in
the
actuality
and
in
the
power
of
tedric
new
god
he
had
to
for
the
miracle
he
had
performed
spoke
for
itself
while
sarpedion
had
not
appeared
personally
in
devann
lifetime
he
had
so
appeared
many
times
in
the
past
and
by
a
sufficiently
attractive
sacrifice
he
could
be
persuaded
to
appear
again
particularly
since
this
appearance
would
be
in
no
slave
or
any
number
of
slaves
would
do
nor
criminals
no
ordinary
virgin
of
the
common
people
this
sacrifice
must
be
of
supreme
quality
the
king
himself
too
old
and
tough
and
sinful
ah
the
daughter
at
the
thought
the
pit
of
his
stomach
turned
cold
however
desperate
situations
require
desperate
remedies
he
called
in
his
henchmen
and
issued
orders
thus
it
came
about
that
a
towering
figure
clad
in
flashing
golden
armor
the
king
himself
with
a
few
courtiers
scrambling
far
in
his
wake
dashed
up
the
last
few
steps
just
as
tedric
was
wrenching
out
sarpedion
liver
tedric
attend
the
monarch
panted
the
priests
have
taken
rhoann
and
are
about
to
give
her
to
sarpedion
they
ca
sire
i
just
killed
sarpedion
right
here
but
they
they
taken
the
holiest
one
from
the
innermost
shrine
have
enshrined
him
on
the
temple
of
scheene
slay
me
those
traitor
priests
before
they
slay
rhoann
and
you
may
tedric
did
not
hear
the
rest
of
it
nor
was
his
mind
chiefly
concerned
with
the
plight
of
the
royal
maid
it
was
sarpedion
he
was
after
with
a
blistering
oath
he
dropped
the
god
liver
whirled
around
and
leaped
down
the
stairway
it
would
do
no
good
to
kill
only
one
sarpedion
he
would
have
to
kill
them
both
especially
since
the
holiest
one
was
the
major
image
the
holiest
one
the
sarpedion
never
before
seen
except
by
priests
of
that
would
be
the
one
use
in
sacrificing
a
king
daughter
he
should
have
thought
of
that
himself
sooner
damn
him
for
a
fool
it
probably
was
too
late
yet
but
the
sooner
he
got
there
the
better
would
be
his
chance
of
winning
hence
he
ran
and
farther
and
farther
behind
him
came
the
king
and
the
courtiers
reaching
the
temple
of
scheene
he
found
to
his
immense
relief
that
he
would
not
have
to
storm
that
rampart
alone
a
full
company
of
the
royal
guard
was
already
there
battle
was
in
progress
but
very
little
headway
was
being
made
against
the
defenders
of
the
god
and
tedric
knew
why
a
man
fighting
against
a
god
was
licked
before
he
started
and
knew
it
he
have
to
build
up
their
morale
but
did
he
have
time
probably
they
could
hurry
things
too
much
without
insulting
sarpedion
for
the
absolutely
necessary
ceremonies
took
a
lot
of
time
anyway
he
have
to
take
the
time
or
he
never
reach
the
god
art
lord
tedric
a
burly
captain
disentangled
himself
from
the
front
rank
and
saluted
i
tedric
yes
knewst
i
was
coming
yes
lord
orders
came
by
helio
but
now
you
are
in
command
you
speak
with
the
voice
of
king
phagon
himself
good
call
your
men
back
thirty
paces
pick
me
out
the
twelve
or
fifteen
strongest
to
lead
men
of
the
royal
guard
he
raised
his
voice
to
a
volume
audible
not
only
to
his
own
men
but
also
to
all
the
enemy
who
is
the
most
powerful
swordsman
among
you
stand
forward
this
armor
i
wear
is
not
of
iron
but
of
the
metal
of
llosir
my
personal
and
god
that
all
here
may
see
and
know
i
command
you
to
strike
at
me
your
shrewdest
most
effective
most
powerful
blow
the
soldier
after
a
couple
of
false
starts
did
manage
a
stroke
of
sorts
i
said
tedric
roared
think
you
ordinary
iron
can
harm
the
personal
metal
of
a
god
strike
where
you
please
at
head
or
neck
or
shoulder
or
guts
but
strike
as
though
you
meant
it
strike
to
kill
shatter
your
sword
strike
convulsively
the
fellow
struck
swinging
for
the
neck
and
at
impact
his
blade
snapped
into
three
pieces
a
wave
of
visible
relief
swept
over
the
guardsmen
one
of
dismay
and
shock
over
the
ranks
of
the
foe
i
implore
pardon
lord
the
soldier
begged
dropping
to
one
knee
up
man
is
nothing
and
by
my
direct
order
now
men
i
can
tell
you
a
thing
you
would
not
have
fully
believed
before
i
have
just
killed
half
of
sarpedion
and
he
could
not
touch
me
i
am
about
to
kill
his
other
half
you
will
see
me
do
it
come
what
may
of
god
or
devil
you
need
not
fear
it
for
i
and
all
with
me
fight
under
shield
we
men
will
have
to
deal
only
with
the
flesh
and
blood
of
those
runty
mercenaries
of
tark
he
studied
the
enemy
formation
briefly
a
solid
phalanx
of
spearmen
with
shields
latticed
and
braced
spears
and
anchored
strictly
defensive
they
had
made
a
move
to
follow
nor
thrown
a
single
javelin
when
the
king
forces
withdrew
this
going
to
be
easy
but
it
possible
we
will
make
the
formation
of
the
wedge
with
me
as
point
he
went
on
sergeant
you
will
bear
my
sword
and
hammer
the
rest
of
you
will
ram
me
into
the
center
of
that
phalanx
with
everything
of
driving
force
that
in
you
lies
i
will
make
and
maintain
enough
of
opening
we
go
up
that
ramp
like
a
fast
ship
plowing
through
waves
make
wedge
drive
except
for
his
armor
of
tedric
would
have
been
crushed
flat
by
the
impact
of
the
flying
wedge
against
the
soldiery
packed
so
solidly
on
the
stair
several
of
the
foe
were
so
crushed
but
the
new
armor
held
tedric
could
scarcely
move
his
legs
enough
to
take
each
step
his
body
was
held
as
though
in
a
vise
but
his
giant
arms
were
free
and
by
dint
of
short
savage
punching
jabs
and
prods
and
strokes
of
his
atrocious
he
made
and
maintained
the
narrow
opening
upon
which
the
success
of
the
whole
operation
depended
and
into
that
opening
the
smith
was
driven
irresistibly
driven
by
the
concerted
and
synchronized
strength
of
the
strongest
men
of
lomarr
royal
guard
the
result
was
not
exactly
like
that
of
a
snowplow
but
it
was
good
enough
the
mercenaries
did
not
flow
over
the
sides
of
the
ramp
in
two
smooth
waves
however
unable
with
either
weapons
or
bodies
to
break
through
the
slanting
walls
of
iron
formed
by
the
shields
of
the
guardsmen
over
the
edges
they
went
the
living
and
the
dead
the
dreadful
wedge
drove
on
as
the
guardsmen
neared
the
top
of
the
stairway
the
mercenaries
disappeared
enough
of
that
kind
of
thing
was
a
great
plenty
and
tedric
after
a
quick
glance
around
to
see
what
the
situation
was
seized
his
sword
from
the
bearer
old
devann
had
his
knife
aloft
but
in
only
the
third
of
the
five
formal
passes
two
more
to
go
kill
those
priests
he
snapped
at
the
captain
i
take
the
three
at
the
altar
you
fellows
take
the
rest
of
them
when
tedric
reached
the
green
altar
the
sacrificial
knife
was
again
aloft
but
the
same
stroke
that
severed
devann
upraised
right
arm
severed
also
his
head
and
his
whole
left
shoulder
two
more
whistling
strokes
and
a
moment
study
of
the
scene
of
action
assured
him
that
there
would
be
no
more
sacrifice
that
day
the
king
archers
had
followed
close
behind
the
guards
the
situation
was
well
in
hand
he
exchanged
sword
for
axe
and
hammer
and
furiously
viciously
went
to
work
on
the
god
he
yanked
out
the
holiest
one
brain
liver
and
heart
hammered
and
chopped
the
rest
of
him
to
bits
that
done
he
turned
to
the
altar
he
had
not
even
glanced
at
it
before
stretched
taut
by
wrists
and
ankles
on
the
reeking
green
the
lady
rhoann
lay
her
thick
brown
hair
a
riot
six
priests
had
not
immobilized
rhoann
of
lomarr
without
a
struggle
her
eyes
went
from
shattered
image
to
armored
giant
and
back
to
image
her
face
was
a
study
of
amazement
he
slashed
the
ropes
extended
his
mailed
right
hand
art
hurt
lady
rhoann
no
just
stiff
taking
his
hand
she
sat
up
a
bit
groggily
and
flexed
wrists
and
ankles
experimentally
while
behind
his
visor
the
man
stared
and
stared
tall
wide
but
trim
superbly
made
a
true
scion
of
the
old
blood
llosir
liver
what
a
woman
he
had
undressed
her
mentally
more
than
once
but
his
visionings
had
fallen
short
far
short
of
the
entrancing
the
magnificent
truth
a
woman
a
virgin
huh
technically
so
perhaps
more
shame
to
those
pusillanimous
midgets
of
the
court
if
had
been
born
noble
she
slid
off
the
altar
and
stood
up
her
eyes
still
dark
with
fantastically
mixed
emotions
she
threw
both
arms
around
his
armored
neck
and
snuggled
close
against
his
steel
heedless
that
breasts
and
flanks
were
being
smeared
anew
with
blood
he
put
an
arm
around
her
moved
her
arm
enough
to
open
his
visor
saw
eyes
only
a
few
inches
below
his
own
staring
straight
into
his
the
man
quick
passion
flamed
again
gods
of
the
ancients
what
a
woman
was
a
mate
for
a
man
thank
the
gods
the
king
dashed
up
panting
but
in
surprisingly
good
shape
for
a
man
of
who
had
run
so
far
in
gold
armor

flashed
high
in

voice

that
is

he
turned
to
the

still
clinging
to
his
side
i
had
it
first
in
mind
lady
rhoann
to
make
you
priestess
but
not

she
interrupted
vigorously
no

you
right

enough

tedric
of

the
discoverer
of

he
could
be
manipulated
very
easily
but
after
all
the
real
catastrophe
is
about
three
hundred
eighteen
years
away
there
is
nothing
alarming
about
the
shape
of
the
curve
and
any
interference
with
the
actual

events
of
the
past
would
almost
certainly
prove
calamitous
over
the
years
i
have
found
your
judgment
good
what
is
your
thought
on
this
matter
furmin
would
say
to

months
even
though

or

we
