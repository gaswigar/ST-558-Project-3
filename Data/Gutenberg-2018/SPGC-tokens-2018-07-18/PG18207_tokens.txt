coffee
and
repartee
i
the
guests
at
smithers
for
gentlemen
had
assembled
as
usual
for
breakfast
and
in
a
few
moments
mary
the
dainty
waitress
entered
with
the
steaming
coffee
the
mush
and
the
rolls
the
who
was
suspected
by
smithers
of
having
intentions
and
who
for
that
reason
occupied
the
chair
nearest
the
lady
heart
folded
up
the
morning
paper
and
placing
it
under
him
so
that
no
one
else
could
get
it
observed
quite
genially
for
him
it
was
very
wet
yesterday
i
did
find
it
so
observed
a
young
man
seated
down
the
table
who
was
by
common
consent
called
the
idiot
because
of
his
views
in
fact
i
was
very
dry
curious
thing
i
always
dry
on
rainy
days
i
am
one
of
the
kind
of
men
who
know
that
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
to
stay
in
when
it
rains
or
to
carry
an
umbrella
when
it
is
not
possible
to
stay
at
home
or
having
no
home
like
ourselves
to
remain
cooped
up
in
stalls
or
stalled
up
in
coops
as
you
may
prefer
you
carried
an
umbrella
then
queried
the
landlady
ignoring
the
idiot
shaft
at
the
size
of
her
elegant
and
airy
apartments
with
an
ease
born
of
experience
yes
madame
returned
the
idiot
quite
unconscious
of
what
was
coming
whose
queried
the
lady
a
sarcastic
smile
playing
about
her
lips
that
i
can
not
say
smithers
replied
the
idiot
serenely
but
it
is
the
one
you
usually
carry
your
insinuation
sir
said
the
coming
to
the
landlady
rescue
is
an
unworthy
one
the
umbrella
in
question
is
mine
it
has
been
in
my
possession
for
five
years
then
replied
the
idiot
unabashed
it
is
time
you
returned
it
you
think
men
morals
are
rather
lax
in
this
matter
of
umbrellas
mr
whitechoker
he
added
turning
from
the
who
began
to
show
signs
of
irritation
very
said
the
minister
running
his
finger
about
his
neck
to
make
the
collar
which
had
been
sent
home
from
the
laundry
by
mistake
set
more
easily
very
lax
at
the
last
conference
i
attended
some
person
forgetting
his
high
office
as
a
minister
in
the
church
walked
off
with
my
umbrella
without
so
much
as
a
thank
you
and
it
was
embarrassing
too
because
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
bucketfuls
what
did
you
do
asked
the
landlady
sympathetically
she
liked
whitechoker
sermons
and
beyond
this
he
was
a
more
profitable
boarder
than
any
of
the
others
remaining
home
to
luncheon
every
day
and
having
to
pay
extra
therefor
there
was
but
one
thing
left
for
me
to
do
i
took
the
umbrella
said
whitechoker
blushing
slightly
but
you
returned
it
of
course
said
the
idiot
i
intended
to
but
i
left
it
on
the
train
on
my
way
back
home
the
next
day
replied
the
clergyman
visibly
embarrassed
by
the
unexpected
it
the
same
way
with
books
put
in
the
bibliomaniac
an
unfortunate
being
whose
love
of
rare
first
editions
had
brought
him
down
from
affluence
to
boarding
many
a
man
who
would
steal
a
dollar
would
run
off
with
a
book
i
had
a
friend
once
who
had
a
rare
copy
of
africa
by
it
was
a
beautiful
book
only
copies
printed
the
margins
of
the
pages
were
four
inches
wide
and
the
was
rubricated
the
frontispiece
was
colored
by
hand
and
the
seventeenth
page
had
one
of
the
most
amusing
typographical
errors
on
it
was
there
any
in
the
book
queried
the
idiot
blowing
softly
on
a
hot
potato
that
was
nicely
balanced
on
the
end
of
his
fork
illustration
alarmed
the
cook
yes
a
little
but
it
did
amount
to
much
returned
the
bibliomaniac
but
you
know
it
is
as
that
men
like
myself
care
for
books
we
have
a
higher
notion
than
that
it
is
as
a
specimen
of
that
we
admire
a
chaste
bit
of
literature
like
africa
by
but
as
i
was
saying
my
friend
had
this
book
and
he
it
he
had
pictures
from
all
parts
of
the
world
in
it
and
the
book
had
grown
from
a
volume
of
one
hundred
pages
to
four
volumes
of
two
hundred
pages
each
and
it
was
stolen
by
a
highly
honorable
friend
i
suppose
queried
the
idiot
yes
it
was
stolen
and
my
friend
never
knew
by
whom
said
the
bibliomaniac
what
asked
the
idiot
in
much
surprise
did
you
never
confess
it
was
very
fortunate
for
the
idiot
that
the
buckwheat
cakes
were
brought
on
at
this
moment
had
there
not
been
some
diversion
of
that
kind
it
is
certain
that
the
bibliomaniac
would
have
assaulted
him
it
is
very
kind
of
smithers
i
think
said
the
to
provide
us
with
such
delightful
cakes
as
these
free
of
charge
yes
said
the
idiot
helping
himself
to
six
cakes
very
kind
indeed
although
i
must
say
they
are
extremely
economical
from
an
architectural
point
of
view
which
is
to
say
they
are
rather
fuller
of
pores
than
of
buckwheat
i
wonder
why
it
is
he
continued
possibly
to
avert
the
landlady
retaliatory
comments
i
wonder
why
it
is
that
porous
plasters
and
buckwheat
cakes
are
so
similar
in
appearance
and
so
widely
different
in
their
respective
effects
on
the
system
put
in
a
genial
old
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibed
seated
next
to
the
idiot
i
fail
to
see
the
similarity
between
a
buckwheat
cake
and
a
porous
plaster
said
the
resolved
if
possible
to
embarrass
the
idiot
you
do
eh
replied
the
latter
then
it
is
very
plain
sir
that
you
have
never
eaten
a
porous
plaster
to
this
the
could
find
no
reasonable
reply
and
he
took
refuge
in
silence
whitechoker
tried
to
look
severe
the
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibed
smiled
all
over
the
bibliomaniac
ignored
the
remark
entirely
not
having
as
yet
forgiven
the
idiot
for
his
gross
insinuation
regarding
his
friend
de
of
africa
by
mary
the
maid
who
greatly
admired
the
idiot
not
so
much
for
his
idiocy
as
for
the
aristocratic
manner
in
which
he
carried
himself
and
the
truly
striking
striped
shirts
he
wore
left
the
room
in
a
convulsion
of
laughter
that
so
alarmed
the
cook
that
the
next
platterful
of
cakes
were
more
like
tin
plates
than
cakes
and
as
for
smithers
that
worthy
woman
was
speechless
with
wrath
but
she
was
not
paralyzed
apparently
for
reaching
down
into
her
pocket
she
brought
forth
a
small
piece
of
paper
on
which
was
written
in
detail
the
account
due
of
the
idiot
i
like
to
have
this
settled
sir
she
said
with
some
asperity
certainly
my
dear
madame
replied
the
idiot
unabashed
certainly
can
you
change
a
check
for
a
hundred
no
smithers
could
not
then
i
shall
have
to
put
off
paying
the
account
until
this
evening
said
the
idiot
but
he
added
with
a
glance
at
the
amount
of
the
bill
are
you
related
to
governor
mckinley
mrs
smithers
i
am
not
she
returned
sharply
my
mother
was
a
partington
i
only
asked
said
the
idiot
apologetically
because
i
am
very
much
interested
in
the
subject
of
heredity
and
you
may
not
know
it
but
you
and
he
have
each
a
marked
tendency
towards
bills
and
before
smithers
could
think
of
anything
to
say
the
idiot
was
on
his
way
down
town
to
help
his
employer
lose
money
on
wall
street
ii
do
you
know
i
sometimes
think
began
the
idiot
opening
and
shutting
the
silver
cover
of
his
watch
several
times
with
a
snap
with
the
probable
and
not
altogether
laudable
purpose
of
calling
his
attention
to
the
fact
of
which
she
was
already
painfully
aware
that
breakfast
was
fifteen
minutes
late
do
you
really
interrupted
the
looking
up
from
his
book
with
an
air
of
mock
surprise
i
am
sure
i
never
should
have
suspected
it
indeed
returned
the
idiot
undisturbed
by
this
reflection
upon
his
intellect
i
do
really
know
whether
that
is
due
to
your
generally
unsuspicious
nature
or
to
your
shortcomings
as
a
there
are
some
minds
put
in
the
landlady
at
this
point
that
are
so
small
that
it
would
certainly
ruin
the
eyes
to
read
them
i
have
seen
many
such
observed
the
idiot
suavely
even
our
friend
the
bibliomaniac
at
times
has
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
and
that
reminds
me
doctor
he
continued
addressing
himself
to
the
medical
boarder
what
is
the
cause
of
that
returned
the
doctor
ponderously
is
a
very
large
question
generally
speaking
is
the
result
of
the
projection
of
the
intellect
into
surroundings
other
than
those
which
for
want
of
a
better
term
i
might
call
the
corporeally
immediate
so
i
have
understood
said
the
idiot
approvingly
and
is
acquired
or
inherent
here
the
idiot
appropriated
the
roll
of
his
neighbor
that
depends
largely
upon
the
case
replied
the
doctor
nervously
some
are
born
some
achieve
and
some
have
thrust
upon
them
as
illustrations
of
which
we
might
take
for
instance
i
suppose
said
the
idiot
the
born
idiot
the
borrower
and
the
man
who
is
knocked
silly
by
the
pole
of
a
truck
on
broadway
precisely
replied
the
doctor
glad
to
get
out
of
the
discussion
so
easily
he
was
a
very
young
doctor
and
not
always
sure
of
himself
or
put
in
the
to
condense
our
illustrations
if
the
idiot
would
kindly
go
out
upon
broadway
and
encounter
the
truck
we
should
find
the
three
combined
in
him
the
landlady
here
laughed
quite
heartily
and
handed
the
an
extra
strong
cup
of
coffee
there
is
a
great
deal
in
what
you
say
said
the
idiot
without
a
tremor
there
are
very
few
scientific
phenomena
that
can
not
be
demonstrated
in
one
way
or
another
by
my
poor
self
it
is
the
exception
always
that
proves
the
rule
and
in
my
case
you
find
a
consistent
converse
exemplification
of
all
three
branches
of
he
talks
well
said
the
bibliomaniac
to
the
minister
yes
especially
when
he
gets
hold
of
large
words
i
really
believe
he
reads
replied
whitechoker
illustration
are
the
first
symptoms
of
insanity
i
know
he
does
said
the
who
had
overheard
i
saw
him
reading
webster
dictionary
last
night
i
have
noticed
however
that
generally
his
vocabulary
is
largely
confined
to
words
that
come
between
the
letters
a
and
f
which
shows
that
as
yet
he
has
not
dipped
very
deeply
into
the
book
what
are
you
murmuring
about
queried
the
idiot
noting
the
lowered
tone
of
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
we
were
conversing
ahem
about
began
the
minister
with
a
despairing
glance
at
the
bibliomaniac
let
me
say
it
interrupted
the
bibliomaniac
you
are
used
to
prevarication
and
that
is
what
is
demanded
at
this
time
we
were
talking
about
ah
about
er
tut
tut
ejaculated
the
we
were
only
saying
we
thought
the
er
the
that
the
what
the
first
symptoms
of
insanity
doctor
observed
the
idiot
with
a
look
of
wonder
at
the
three
shuffling
boarders
opposite
him
and
turning
anxiously
to
the
physician
i
wish
you
would
talk
shop
retorted
the
doctor
angrily
insanity
was
one
of
his
weak
points
it
a
beastly
habit
said
the
much
relieved
at
this
turn
of
the
conversation
well
perhaps
you
are
right
returned
the
idiot
people
do
as
a
rule
prefer
to
talk
of
things
they
know
something
about
and
i
blame
you
doctor
for
wanting
to
keep
out
of
a
medical
discussion
i
only
asked
my
last
question
because
the
behavior
of
the
bibliomaniac
and
whitechoker
and
the
for
some
time
past
has
worried
me
and
i
did
know
but
what
you
might
work
up
a
nice
little
practice
among
us
it
might
not
pay
but
you
find
the
experience
valuable
and
i
think
unique
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
have
a
doctor
right
in
the
house
said
whitechoker
kindly
fearing
that
the
doctor
manifest
indignation
might
get
the
better
of
him
that
returned
the
idiot
is
an
assertion
whitechoker
that
is
both
true
and
untrue
there
are
times
when
a
physician
is
an
ornament
to
a
times
when
he
is
not
for
instance
on
wednesday
morning
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
surgical
skill
of
our
friend
here
our
good
landlady
could
never
have
managed
properly
to
distribute
the
late
autumn
chicken
we
found
upon
the
menu
tally
one
for
the
affirmative
on
the
other
hand
i
must
confess
to
considerable
loss
of
appetite
when
i
see
the
doctor
rolling
his
bread
up
into
little
pills
or
measuring
the
vinegar
he
puts
on
his
salad
by
means
of
a
glass
dropper
and
taking
the
temperature
of
his
coffee
with
his
pocket
thermometer
nor
do
i
like
and
i
should
not
have
mentioned
it
save
by
way
of
illustrating
my
position
in
regard
to
assertion
nor
do
i
like
the
cold
eager
glitter
in
the
doctor
eyes
as
he
watches
me
consuming
with
some
difficulty
i
admit
the
cold
pastry
we
have
served
up
to
us
on
saturday
mornings
under
the
wholly
transparent
of
bread
i
may
have
very
bad
taste
but
in
my
humble
opinion
the
man
who
talks
shop
is
preferable
to
the
one
who
suggests
it
in
his
eyes
some
more
iced
potatoes
mary
he
added
calmly

madame
said
the
doctor
turning
angrily
to
the
landlady
this
is
insufferable
you
may
make
out
my
bill
this
morning
i
shall
have
to
seek
a
home
elsewhere
oh
now
doctor
began
the
landlady
in
her
most
pleading
tone
jove
ejaculated
the
idiot
that
a
good
idea
doctor
i
think
go
with
you
i
not
altogether
satisfied
here
myself
but
to
desert
so
charming
a
company
as
we
have
here
had
never
occurred
to
me
together
however
we
can
go
forth
and
perhaps
find
happiness
shall
we
put
on
our
hunting
togs
and
chase
the
fiery
untamed
to
the
death
this
morning
or
shall
we
put
it
off
until
some
pleasanter
day
put
it
off
observed
the
persuasively
the
idiot
was
only
indulging
in
persiflage
doctor
that
all
when
you
have
known
him
longer
you
will
understand
him
better
views
are
as
necessary
to
him
as
sunlight
to
the
flowers
and
i
truly
think
that
in
an
asylum
he
would
prove
a
delightful
companion
there
doctor
said
the
idiot
that
handsome
of
the
he
could
make
more
of
an
apology
if
he
tried
i
forgive
him
if
you
will
what
say
you
and
strange
to
say
the
doctor
in
spite
of
the
indignation
which
still
left
a
red
tinge
on
his
cheek
laughed
aloud
and
was
reconciled
as
for
the
he
wanted
to
be
angry
but
he
did
not
feel
that
he
could
afford
his
wrath
and
for
the
first
time
in
some
months
the
guests
went
their
several
ways
at
peace
with
each
other
and
the
world
iii
there
was
a
conspiracy
in
hand
to
embarrass
the
idiot
the
and
the
bibliomaniac
had
combined
forces
to
give
him
a
taste
of
his
own
medicine
the
time
had
not
yet
arrived
which
showed
the
idiot
at
a
disadvantage
and
the
two
boarders
the
one
proud
of
his
learning
and
the
other
not
wholly
unconscious
of
a
bookish
life
were
distinctly
tired
of
the
triumphant
manner
in
which
the
idiot
always
left
the
to
their
invariable
discomfiture
it
was
the
suggestion
to
put
their
tormentor
into
the
pit
he
had
heretofore
digged
for
them
the
worthy
instructor
of
youth
had
of
late
come
to
see
that
while
he
was
still
a
prime
favorite
with
his
landlady
he
had
nevertheless
suffered
somewhat
in
her
estimation
because
of
the
apparent
ease
with
which
the
idiot
had
got
the
better
of
him
on
all
points
it
was
necessary
he
thought
to
rehabilitate
himself
and
a
plot
to
which
the
bibliomaniac
readily
lent
ear
was
the
result
of
his
reflections
they
twain
were
to
indulge
in
a
discussion
of
the
great
story
of
which
both
were
confident
the
idiot
had
not
read
and
concerning
which
they
felt
assured
he
could
not
have
an
intelligent
opinion
if
he
had
read
it
so
it
happened
upon
this
bright
sunday
morning
that
as
the
boarders
sat
them
down
to
partake
of
the
usual
restful
breakfast
as
the
idiot
termed
it
the
bibliomaniac
observed
i
have
just
finished
reading
have
you
indeed
returned
the
with
apparent
interest
i
trust
you
profited
by
it
on
the
contrary
observed
the
bibliomaniac
my
views
are
much
unsettled
by
it
i
prefer
the
breast
of
the
chicken
smithers
observed
the
idiot
sending
his
plate
back
to
the
presiding
genius
of
the
table
the
neck
of
a
chicken
is
graceful
but
not
too
full
of
sustenance
he
fights
shy
whispered
the
bibliomaniac
gleefully
never
mind
returned
the
confidently
we
land
him
yet
then
he
added
aloud
unsettled
by
it
i
fail
to
see
how
any
man
with
beliefs
that
are
at
all
the
result
of
mature
convictions
can
be
unsettled
by
the
story
of
for
my
part
i
believe
and
i
have
always
said
i
never
could
understand
why
the
neck
of
a
chicken
should
be
allowed
on
a
respectable
table
anyhow
continued
the
idiot
ignoring
the
controversy
in
which
his
neighbors
were
engaged
unless
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
deceased
fowl
met
with
an
accidental
rather
than
a
natural
death
in
what
way
does
the
neck
demonstrate
that
point
queried
the
bibliomaniac
forgetting
the
conspiracy
for
a
moment
by
its
twist
or
by
its
length
of
course
returned
the
idiot
a
chicken
that
dies
a
natural
death
does
not
have
its
neck
wrung
nor
when
the
head
is
removed
by
the
use
of
a
hatchet
is
it
likely
that
it
will
be
cut
off
so
close
behind
the
ears
that
those
who
eat
the
chicken
are
confronted
with
four
inches
of
neck
illustration
stuck
to
the
pigs
very
entertaining
indeed
interposed
the
but
we
are
wandering
from
the
point
the
bibliomaniac
and
i
were
discussing
is
or
is
not
the
story
of
unsettling
to
one
beliefs
perhaps
you
can
help
us
to
decide
that
question
perhaps
i
can
returned
the
idiot
and
perhaps
not
it
did
not
unsettle
my
beliefs
but
do
you
think
observed
the
bibliomaniac
that
to
certain
minds
the
book
is
more
or
less
unsettling
to
that
i
can
confidently
say
no
the
certain
mind
knows
no
uncertainty
replied
the
idiot
calmly
very
pretty
indeed
said
the
coldly
but
what
was
your
opinion
of
ward
handling
of
the
subject
do
you
think
she
was
sufficiently
realistic
and
if
so
and
elsmere
weakened
under
the
stress
of
circumstances
do
you
think
or
do
you
think
the
production
of
such
a
book
harmful
because
being
real
it
must
of
necessity
be
unsettling
to
some
minds
illustration
the
conspirators
i
prefer
not
to
express
an
opinion
on
that
subject
returned
the
idiot
because
i
never
read
never
read
it
ejaculated
the
a
look
of
triumph
in
his
eyes
why
everybody
has
read
that
pretends
to
have
read
anything
asserted
the
bibliomaniac
of
course
put
in
the
landlady
with
a
scornful
laugh
well
i
did
said
the
idiot
nonchalantly
the
same
ground
was
gone
over
two
years
before
in
burrows
great
story
it
or
is
it
not
and
anybody
who
ever
read
clink
books
on
the
as
opposed
to
what
knows
where
burrows
got
his
points
burrows
story
was
a
perfect
marvel
i
do
know
how
many
editions
it
went
through
in
england
and
when
it
was
translated
into
french
by
madame
tournay
it
simply
set
the
french
wild
great
scott
whispered
the
bibliomaniac
desperately
i
afraid
we
been
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
you
read
clink
i
suppose
asked
the
idiot
turning
to
the
y
yes
returned
the
blushing
deeply
the
idiot
looked
surprised
and
tried
to
conceal
a
smile
by
sipping
his
coffee
from
a
spoon
and
burrows
no
returned
the
humbly
i
never
read
burrows
well
you
ought
to
it
a
great
book
and
it
the
one
is
taken
from
same
ideas
all
through
i
told
that
why
i
did
read
waste
of
time
you
know
but
you
noticed
yourself
i
suppose
that
clink
ground
is
the
same
as
that
covered
in
no
i
only
dipped
lightly
into
clink
returned
the
with
some
embarrassment
but
you
could
help
noticing
a
similarity
of
ideas
insisted
the
idiot
calmly
the
looked
beseechingly
at
the
bibliomaniac
who
would
have
been
glad
to
fly
to
his
assistance
had
he
known
how
but
never
having
heard
of
clink
or
burrows
either
for
that
matter
he
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
best
for
his
reputation
for
him
to
stay
out
of
the
controversy
very
slight
similarity
however
said
the
in
despair
where
can
i
find
clink
books
put
in
whitechoker
very
much
interested
the
idiot
conveniently
had
his
mouth
full
of
chicken
at
the
moment
and
it
was
to
the
who
had
also
read
him
that
they
all
the
landlady
included
looked
for
an
answer
oh
i
think
returned
that
worthy
hesitatingly
i
think
you
find
clink
in
any
of
the
public
libraries
what
is
his
full
name
persisted
whitechoker
taking
out
a
horace
clink
said
the
idiot
yes
that
it
horace
clink
echoed
the
very
virile
writer
and
a
clear
thinker
he
added
with
some
nervousness
what
if
any
of
his
books
would
you
specially
recommend
asked
the
minister
again
the
idiot
had
by
this
time
risen
from
the
table
and
was
leaving
the
room
with
the
genial
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibed
the
reply
was
not
audible
i
say
said
the
genial
gentleman
to
the
idiot
as
they
passed
out
into
the
hall
they
did
get
much
the
best
of
you
in
that
matter
but
tell
me
who
was
clink
anyhow
never
heard
of
him
before
returned
the
idiot
and
burrows
same
as
clink
know
anything
about
chuckled
the
genial
gentleman
nothing
except
that
it
and
in
clover
came
out
at
the
same
time
and
i
stuck
to
the
pigs
and
the
genial
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibed
was
so
pleased
at
the
plight
of
the
and
of
the
bibliomaniac
that
he
invited
the
idiot
up
to
his
room
where
the
private
stock
was
kept
for
just
such
occasions
and
they
put
in
a
very
pleasant
morning
together
iv
the
guests
were
assembled
as
usual
the
oatmeal
course
had
been
eaten
in
silence
in
the
idiot
eye
there
was
a
cold
glitter
of
expectancy
a
glitter
that
boded
ill
for
the
man
who
should
challenge
him
to
controversial
combat
and
there
seemed
also
to
be
judging
from
sundry
winks
passed
over
the
table
and
kicks
passed
under
it
an
understanding
to
which
he
and
the
genial
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibed
were
parties
as
the
sampled
his
coffee
the
genial
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibed
broke
the
silence
i
missed
you
at
the
concert
last
night
mr
idiot
said
he
yes
said
the
idiot
with
a
caressing
movement
of
the
hand
over
his
upper
lip
i
was
very
sorry
but
i
could
get
around
last
night
i
had
an
engagement
with
a
number
of
friends
at
the
athletic
club
i
meant
to
have
dropped
you
a
line
in
the
afternoon
telling
you
about
it
but
i
forgot
it
until
it
was
too
late
was
the
concert
a
success
very
successful
indeed
the
best
one
in
fact
we
have
had
this
season
which
makes
me
regret
all
the
more
deeply
your
absence
returned
the
genial
gentleman
with
a
suggestion
of
a
smile
playing
about
his
lips
indeed
he
added
it
was
the
finest
one
i
ever
seen
the
finest
one
you
what
queried
the
startled
at
the
verb
the
finest
one
i
ever
seen
replied
the
genial
gentleman
there
were
only
ten
performers
and
really
in
all
my
experience
as
an
attendant
at
concerts
i
never
saw
such
a
magnificent
rendering
of
beethoven
as
we
had
last
night
i
wish
you
could
have
been
there
it
was
a
sight
for
the
gods
i
do
believe
said
the
idiot
with
a
slight
cough
that
may
have
been
intended
to
conceal
a
laugh
and
that
may
also
have
been
the
result
of
too
many
cigarettes
i
do
believe
it
could
have
been
any
more
interesting
than
a
game
of
pool
i
heard
at
the
club
it
appears
to
me
said
the
bibliomaniac
to
the
that
the
popping
sounds
we
heard
late
last
night
in
the
idiot
room
may
have
some
connection
with
the
present
mode
of
speech
these
two
gentlemen
affect
let
hear
them
out
returned
the
and
then
we
take
them
into
camp
as
the
idiot
would
say
i
do
know
about
that
replied
the
genial
gentleman
i
seen
a
great
many
concerts
and
i
heard
a
great
many
good
games
of
pool
but
the
concert
last
night
was
simply
a
ravishing
spectacle
we
had
a
cuban
pianist
there
who
played
the
orchestration
of
the
first
act
of
with
surprising
agility
as
far
as
i
could
see
he
miss
a
note
though
it
was
a
little
annoying
to
observe
how
he
used
the
pedals
too
forcibly
or
how
queried
the
idiot
not
forcibly
enough
returned
the
imbiber
he
tried
to
work
them
both
with
one
foot
it
was
the
only
thing
to
mar
an
otherwise
marvellous
performance
the
idea
of
a
man
trying
to
display
wagner
with
two
hands
and
one
foot
is
irritating
to
a
musician
with
a
trained
eye
illustration
your
ears
long
enough
i
wish
the
doctor
would
come
down
said
smithers
anxiously
yes
put
in
the
there
seems
to
be
madness
in
our
midst
well
what
can
you
expect
of
a
cuban
anyhow
queried
the
idiot
the
cuban
like
the
spaniard
or
the
italian
or
the
african
has
the
vigor
which
is
necessary
for
the
proper
comprehension
and
rendering
of
wagner
music
he
is
by
nature
slow
and
indolent
if
it
were
easier
for
a
spaniard
to
hop
than
to
walk
he
hop
and
rest
his
other
leg
known
italians
whose
diet
was
entirely
confined
to
liquids
because
they
were
too
tired
to
masticate
solids
it
is
the
ease
with
which
it
can
be
absorbed
that
makes
macaroni
the
favorite
dish
of
the
italians
and
the
fondness
of
all
latin
races
for
wines
is
entirely
due
i
think
to
the
fact
that
wine
can
be
swallowed
without
chewing
this
indolence
affects
also
their
language
the
italian
and
the
spaniard
speak
the
language
that
comes
easy
that
is
soft
and
dreamy
while
the
germans
and
russians
stronger
more
energetic
indulge
in
a
speech
that
even
to
us
who
are
people
of
an
average
amount
of
energy
is
sometimes
appalling
in
the
severity
of
the
strain
it
puts
upon
the
tongue
so
while
i
do
not
wonder
that
your
cuban
pianist
showed
woful
defects
in
his
use
of
the
pedals
i
do
wonder
that
even
with
his
surprising
agility
he
had
sufficient
energy
to
manipulate
the
keys
to
the
satisfaction
of
so
competent
a
witness
as
yourself
it
was
too
bad
but
we
made
up
for
it
later
asserted
the
other
there
was
a
young
girl
there
who
gave
us
some
of
mendelssohn
songs
without
words
her
expression
was
simply
perfect
i
would
have
missed
it
for
all
the
world
and
now
that
i
think
of
it
in
a
few
days
i
can
let
you
see
for
yourself
how
splendid
it
was
we
persuaded
her
to
encore
the
songs
in
the
dark
and
we
got
a
photograph
of
two
of
them
oh
then
it
was
not
on
the
she
gave
them
said
the
idiot
oh
no
all
labial
returned
the
genial
gentleman
here
whitechoker
began
to
look
concerned
and
whispered
something
to
the
who
replied
that
there
were
enough
others
present
to
cope
with
the
two
parties
to
the
conversation
in
case
of
a
violent
outbreak
i
be
very
glad
to
see
the
photographs
replied
the
idiot
ca
i
secure
copies
of
them
for
my
collection
you
know
i
have
the
complete
rendering
of
sweet
home
in
kodak
views
as
sung
by
patti
they
are
simply
wonderful
and
they
prove
what
has
repeatedly
been
said
by
critics
that
in
the
matter
of
expression
the
superior
of
patti
has
never
been
seen
i
try
to
get
them
for
you
though
i
doubt
it
can
be
done
the
artist
is
a
very
shy
young
girl
and
does
not
care
to
have
her
efforts
given
too
great
a
publicity
until
she
is
ready
to
go
into
music
a
little
more
deeply
she
is
going
to
read
the
sonata
to
us
at
our
next
concert
you
better
come
i
told
her
gestures
bring
out
the
composer
meaning
in
a
manner
never
as
yet
equalled
illustration
corks
popped
to
some
purpose
last
night
i
be
there
thank
you
returned
the
idiot
and
the
next
time
those
fellows
at
the
club
are
down
for
a
pool
tournament
i
want
you
to
come
up
and
hear
them
play
it
was
extraordinary
last
night
to
hear
the
balls
dropping
one
by
one
click
click
click
as
regularly
as
a
metronome
into
the
pockets
one
of
the
finest
shots
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
missed
how
did
it
happen
asked
the
bibliomaniac
were
your
ears
long
enough
it
was
a
kiss
shot
and
i
could
hear
it
returned
the
idiot
i
think
you
men
are
crazy
said
the
unable
to
contain
himself
any
longer
so
observed
the
idiot
calmly
and
how
do
we
show
our
insanity
seeing
concerts
and
hearing
games
of
pool
i
take
exception
to
your
ruling
returned
the
imbiber
as
my
friend
the
idiot
has
frequently
remarked
you
have
the
peculiarity
of
a
great
many
men
in
your
profession
who
think
because
they
never
happened
to
see
or
do
or
hear
things
as
other
people
do
they
may
not
be
seen
done
or
heard
at
all
i
the
concert
i
attended
last
night
our
musical
club
has
rooms
next
to
a
hospital
and
we
have
to
give
silent
concerts
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
patients
but
we
are
all
musicians
of
sufficient
education
to
understand
by
a
glance
of
the
eye
what
you
would
fail
to
comprehend
with
fourteen
ears
and
a
microphone
very
well
said
put
in
the
idiot
with
a
scornful
glance
at
the
and
i
literally
heard
the
pool
tournament
i
was
dining
in
a
room
off
the
and
every
shot
that
was
made
with
the
exception
of
the
one
i
spoke
of
was
distinctly
audible
you
gentlemen
who
think
you
know
it
all
would
be
able
to
supply
a
bureau
of
information
at
the
rate
of
five
minutes
a
day
for
an
hour
on
a
holiday
let
go
he
added
turning
to
the
imbiber
where
we
may
discuss
our
last
night
entertainment
apart
from
this
atmosphere
of
rarefied
learning
it
makes
me
faint
and
the
imbiber
who
was
with
difficulty
keeping
his
lips
in
proper
form
was
glad
enough
to
accept
the
invitation
the
corks
popped
to
some
purpose
last
night
he
said
later
on
yes
said
the
idiot
for
a
conspiracy
there
nothing
so
helpful
as
popping
corks
v
when
you
get
through
with
the
fire
pedagog
observed
the
idiot
one
winter
morning
noticing
that
the
ample
proportions
of
the
served
as
a
screen
to
shut
off
the
heat
from
himself
and
the
genial
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibed
i
wish
you
would
let
us
have
a
little
of
it
indeed
if
you
could
conveniently
spare
so
little
as
one
flame
for
my
friend
here
and
myself
we
be
much
obliged
it
wo
hurt
you
to
cool
off
a
little
sir
returned
the
without
moving
no
i
am
not
so
much
afraid
of
the
injury
that
may
be
mine
as
i
am
concerned
for
you
if
that
fire
should
melt
our
only
refrigerating
material
i
do
not
know
what
our
good
landlady
would
do
is
it
true
as
the
bibliomaniac
asserts
that
smithers
leaves
all
her
milk
and
butter
in
your
room
overnight
relying
upon
your
coolness
to
keep
them
fresh
i
never
made
any
such
assertion
said
the
bibliomaniac
warmly
i
am
not
used
to
having
my
word
disputed
returned
the
idiot
with
a
wink
at
the
genial
old
gentleman
but
i
never
said
it
and
i
defy
you
to
prove
that
i
said
it
returned
the
bibliomaniac
hotly
you
forget
sir
said
the
idiot
coolly
that
you
are
the
one
who
disputes
my
assertion
that
casts
the
burden
of
proof
on
your
shoulders
of
course
if
you
can
prove
that
you
never
said
anything
of
the
sort
i
withdraw
but
if
you
can
not
adduce
proofs
you
having
doubted
my
word
and
publicly
at
that
need
not
feel
hurt
if
i
decline
to
accept
all
that
you
say
as
gospel
you
show
ridiculous
heat
said
the
thank
you
returned
the
idiot
gracefully
and
that
brings
us
back
to
the
original
proposition
that
you
would
do
well
to
show
a
little
yourself
gentlemen
said
smithers
entering
the
room
at
this
moment
it
a
bright
fresh
morning
like
yourself
said
the
gallantly
yes
added
the
idiot
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
which
registered
minutes
after
the
breakfast
hour
very
like
smithers
rather
advanced
to
this
the
landlady
paid
no
attention
but
the
could
not
refrain
from
saying
advanced
and
therefore
not
backward
like
some
persons
i
might
name
very
clever
retorted
the
idiot
and
really
worth
rewarding
smithers
you
ought
to
give
pedagog
a
receipt
in
full
for
the
past
six
months
pedagog
returned
the
landlady
severely
is
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
always
have
their
receipts
for
the
past
six
months
which
betrays
a
very
saving
disposition
accorded
the
idiot
i
wish
i
had
all
i
received
for
six
months
i
be
a
rich
man
illustration
you
could
spare
so
little
as
one
flame
would
you
now
queried
the
bibliomaniac
that
is
interesting
enough
how
men
ideas
differ
on
the
subject
of
wealth
here
is
the
idiot
would
consider
himself
rich
with
in
his
pocket
do
you
think
he
gets
as
much
as
that
put
in
the
viciously
five
dollars
a
week
is
rather
high
pay
for
one
of
his
very
high
indeed
agreed
the
idiot
i
wish
i
got
that
much
i
might
be
able
to
hire
a
encyclopædia
to
tell
me
everything
and
have
over
a
week
left
to
spend
on
opera
dress
and
the
poor
but
honest
board
smithers
provides
if
my
salary
was
up
to
the
mark
but
the
trouble
is
men
do
not
make
the
fabulous
fortunes
nowadays
with
the
ease
with
which
you
pedagog
made
yours
there
are
no
doubt
more
and
greater
opportunities
than
there
were
in
the
olden
time
but
there
are
also
more
men
trying
to
take
advantage
of
them
labor
in
the
business
world
is
badly
watered
the
colleges
are
turning
out
more
men
in
a
week
nowadays
than
the
whole
country
turned
out
in
a
year
forty
years
ago
and
the
quality
is
so
poor
that
there
has
been
a
general
reduction
of
wages
all
along
the
line
where
does
the
struggler
for
existence
come
in
when
he
has
to
compete
with
the
youth
who
for
fear
of
not
getting
employment
anywhere
is
willing
to
work
for
nothing
people
are
not
willing
to
pay
for
what
they
can
get
for
nothing
i
am
glad
to
hear
from
your
lips
so
complete
an
admission
said
the
that
education
is
downing
ignorance
i
am
glad
to
know
of
your
gladness
returned
the
idiot
i
quite
say
that
education
was
downing
ignorance
i
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
of
holding
the
belief
that
unskilled
omniscience
interferes
very
materially
with
skilled
sciolism
in
skilled
sciolism
efforts
to
make
a
living
then
you
admit
your
own
superficiality
asked
the
somewhat
surprised
by
the
idiot
command
of
syllables
i
admit
that
i
do
not
know
it
all
returned
the
idiot
i
prefer
to
go
through
life
feeling
that
there
is
yet
something
for
me
to
learn
it
seems
to
me
far
better
to
admit
this
voluntarily
than
to
have
it
forced
home
upon
me
by
circumstances
as
happened
in
the
case
of
a
college
graduate
i
know
who
speculated
on
wall
street
and
lost
the
hundred
dollars
that
were
subsequently
put
to
a
good
use
by
the
uneducated
me
from
which
you
deduce
that
ignorance
is
better
than
education
queried
the
scornfully
for
an
omniscient
returned
the
idiot
you
are
singularly
i
have
made
no
such
deduction
i
arrive
at
the
conclusion
however
that
in
the
chase
for
the
gilded
shekel
the
education
of
experience
is
better
than
the
coddling
of
alma
mater
in
the
satisfaction
the
personal
satisfaction
one
derives
from
a
liberal
education
i
admit
that
the
sons
of
alma
mater
are
the
better
off
i
never
could
hope
to
be
so
for
instance
as
you
are
illustration
the
as
a
cooler
no
observed
the
you
can
not
raise
grapes
on
a
thistle
farm
any
unbiassed
observer
looking
around
this
table
he
added
and
noting
whitechoker
a
graduate
of
yale
the
bibliomaniac
a
son
of
dear
old
harvard
the
doctor
an
honor
man
of
williams
our
legal
friend
here
a
graduate
of
columbia
to
say
nothing
of
myself
who
was
graduated
with
honors
at
amherst
any
unbiassed
observer
seeing
these
i
say
and
then
seeing
you
would
take
very
long
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
whether
a
man
is
better
off
or
not
for
having
had
a
collegiate
training
there
i
must
again
dispute
your
assertion
returned
the
idiot
the
unbiassed
person
of
whom
you
speak
would
say
is
this
amherst
man
this
cambridge
boy
of
years
of
age
the
reverend
graduate
of
yale
class
of
and
the
other
two
learned
gentlemen
of
summers
each
and
this
poor
ignoramus
of
an
idiot
whose
only
virtue
is
his
modesty
all
in
the
same
box
and
then
he
would
ask
himself
what
way
have
these
sons
of
amherst
yale
harvard
and
so
forth
the
better
of
the
unassuming
idiot
the
same
box
said
the
bibliomaniac
what
do
you
mean
by
that
just
what
i
say
returned
the
idiot
the
same
box
all
boarding
all
eschewing
luxuries
of
necessity
all
paying
their
bills
with
difficulty
all
sparsely
clothed
in
reality
all
keeping
lent
the
year
through
he
would
say
idiot
has
the
best
of
it
for
he
is
young
and
leaving
them
chewing
the
cud
of
reflection
the
idiot
departed
i
thought
they
were
going
to
land
you
that
time
said
the
genial
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibed
later
but
when
i
heard
you
use
the
word
i
knew
you
were
all
right
where
did
you
get
it
my
chief
got
it
off
on
me
at
the
office
the
other
day
i
happened
in
a
mad
moment
to
try
to
unload
some
of
my
original
observations
on
him
apropos
of
my
getting
to
the
office
two
hours
late
in
which
it
was
my
endeavor
to
prove
to
him
that
the
truly
safe
and
conservative
man
was
always
slow
and
so
apt
to
turn
up
late
on
occasions
he
hopped
about
the
office
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
he
informed
me
that
i
was
an
sciolist
i
did
know
what
he
meant
and
so
i
looked
it
up
and
what
did
he
mean
he
meant
that
i
took
the
cake
for
superficiality
and
i
guess
he
was
right
replied
the
idiot
with
a
smile
that
was
not
altogether
mirthful
vi
said
the
idiot
cheerfully
as
he
entered
the
to
this
remark
no
one
but
the
landlady
vouchsafed
a
reply
i
think
it
is
she
said
shortly
it
raining
too
hard
to
be
a
very
good
morning
that
reminds
me
observed
the
idiot
taking
his
seat
and
helping
himself
copiously
to
the
hominy
a
friend
of
mine
on
one
of
the
newspapers
is
preparing
an
article
on
the
of
modern
humor
with
your
kind
permission
smithers
i
take
down
your
remark
and
hand
it
over
to
scribuler
as
a
specimen
of
the
modern
antique
joke
you
may
not
be
aware
of
the
fact
but
that
jest
is
to
be
found
in
the
rare
first
edition
of
the
of
an
italian
humorist
who
stole
everything
he
wrote
from
the
greeks
illustration
the
sunday
newspapers
so
queried
the
bibliomaniac
i
never
heard
of
bobbo
though
i
had
before
the
auction
sale
of
my
library
a
choice
copy
of
the
of
bound
in
full
crushed
levant
morocco
with
gilt
edges
and
one
or
two
other
italian
in
tree
calf
i
can
not
at
this
moment
recall
their
names
at
what
period
did
bobbo
live
inquired
the
i
do
exactly
remember
returned
the
idiot
assisting
the
last
potato
on
the
table
over
to
his
plate
i
do
know
exactly
it
was
subsequent
to
i
think
although
i
may
be
wrong
if
it
was
not
you
may
rest
assured
it
was
prior
to
do
you
happen
to
know
queried
the
bibliomaniac
the
exact
date
of
this
rare
first
edition
of
which
you
speak
no
no
one
knows
that
returned
the
idiot
and
for
a
very
good
reason
it
was
printed
before
dates
were
invented
the
silence
which
followed
this
bit
of
information
from
the
idiot
was
almost
insulting
in
its
intensity
it
was
a
silence
that
spoke
and
what
it
said
was
that
the
idiot
idiocy
was
colossal
and
he
accepting
the
stillness
as
a
tribute
smiled
sweetly
what
do
you
think
whitechoker
he
said
when
he
thought
the
time
was
ripe
for
renewing
the
conversation
what
do
you
think
of
the
doctrine
that
every
day
will
be
sunday
i
have
only
to
say
sir
returned
the
dominie
pouring
a
little
hot
water
into
his
milk
which
was
a
bit
too
strong
for
him
that
i
am
a
firm
believer
in
the
occurrence
of
a
period
when
sunday
will
be
to
all
practical
purposes
perpetual
that
is
my
belief
too
observed
the
but
it
will
be
ruinous
to
our
good
landlady
to
provide
us
with
one
of
her
exceptionally
fine
sunday
breakfasts
every
morning
thank
you
pedagog
returned
smithers
with
a
smile
ca
i
give
you
another
cup
of
coffee
you
may
returned
the
pained
at
the
lady
grammar
but
too
courteous
to
call
attention
to
it
save
by
the
emphasis
with
which
he
spoke
the
word
may
that
one
view
to
take
of
it
said
the
idiot
but
in
case
we
got
a
sunday
breakfast
every
day
in
the
week
we
on
the
other
hand
would
get
approximately
what
we
pay
for
you
may
fill
my
cup
too
mrs
smithers
the
coffee
is
all
gone
returned
the
landlady
with
a
snap
then
mary
said
the
idiot
gracefully
turning
to
the
maid
you
may
give
me
a
glass
of
it
is
quite
as
warm
after
all
as
the
coffee
and
not
quite
so
weak
a
perpetual
sunday
though
would
have
its
drawbacks
he
added
unconscious
of
the
venomous
glances
of
the
landlady
you
whitechoker
for
instance
would
be
preaching
all
the
time
and
in
consequence
would
soon
break
down
then
the
effect
upon
our
eyes
from
habitually
reading
the
sunday
newspapers
day
after
day
would
be
extremely
bad
nor
must
we
forget
that
an
eternity
of
sundays
means
the
elimination
our
midst
as
the
novelists
say
of
baseball
of
circuses
of
and
other
necessities
of
life
unless
we
are
prepared
to
cast
over
the
puritanical
view
of
sunday
which
now
prevails
it
would
substitute
watts
for
rooney
we
should
lose
entirely
which
is
a
point
in
its
favor
i
do
know
about
that
said
the
genial
old
gentleman
i
rather
like
that
song
did
you
ever
hear
me
sing
it
asked
the
idiot
never
mind
returned
the
genial
old
gentleman
hastily
perhaps
you
are
right
after
all
illustration
bobbo
the
idiot
smiled
and
resumed
our
shops
would
be
perpetually
closed
and
an
enormous
loss
to
the
shopkeepers
would
be
sure
to
follow
pedagog
theory
that
we
should
have
sunday
breakfasts
every
day
is
not
tenable
for
the
reason
that
with
a
perpetual
day
of
rest
agriculture
would
die
out
food
products
would
be
killed
off
by
unpulled
weeds
in
fact
we
should
go
back
to
that
really
unfortunate
period
when
women
were
without
and
man
chief
object
in
life
was
to
christen
animals
as
he
met
them
and
to
abstain
from
apples
wisdom
and
full
dress
the
idiot
is
right
said
the
bibliomaniac
it
would
not
be
a
very
good
thing
for
the
world
if
every
day
were
sunday
is
a
necessity
of
life
i
am
willing
to
admit
this
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
meals
are
invariably
atrocious
contracts
would
be
void
as
a
rule
because
sunday
is
a
a
what
asked
the
idiot
a
day
in
a
business
sense
put
in
the
of
course
said
the
landlady
scornfully
any
person
who
knows
anything
knows
that
then
madame
returned
the
idiot
rising
from
his
chair
and
putting
a
handful
of
sweet
crackers
in
his
pocket
then
i
must
put
in
a
claim
for
from
you
having
been
charged
at
the
rate
of
one
dollar
a
day
for
in
the
two
years
i
have
been
with
you
indeed
returned
the
lady
sharply
very
well
and
i
shall
put
in
a
counterclaim
for
the
lunches
you
carry
away
from
breakfast
every
morning
in
your
pockets
in
that
event
we
call
it
off
madame
returned
the
idiot
as
with
a
courtly
bow
and
a
pleasant
smile
he
left
the
room
well
i
call
him
was
all
the
landlady
could
say
as
the
other
guests
took
their
departure
and
of
course
the
agreed
with
her
vii
our
streets
appear
to
be
as
far
from
perfect
as
ever
said
the
bibliomaniac
with
a
sigh
as
he
looked
out
through
the
window
at
the
great
pools
of
water
that
gathered
in
the
basins
made
by
the
sinking
of
the
belgian
blocks
we
better
go
back
to
the
cowpaths
of
our
fathers
there
is
a
great
deal
in
what
you
say
observed
the
the
cowpath
has
all
the
solidity
of
mother
earth
and
none
of
the
distracting
noises
we
get
from
the
pavements
that
obtain
it
is
porous
and
absorbs
the
moisture
the
belgian
pavement
is
leaky
and
lets
it
run
into
our
cellars
we
might
do
far
worse
than
to
go
back
excuse
me
for
having
an
opinion
said
the
idiot
but
the
man
of
enterprise
ca
afford
to
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
the
somnolent
cowpath
it
is
too
quiet
it
conduces
to
sleep
which
is
a
luxury
business
men
can
not
afford
to
indulge
in
too
freely
man
must
be
up
and
doing
the
prosperity
of
a
great
city
is
to
my
mind
directly
due
to
its
noise
and
clatter
which
effectually
put
a
stop
to
napping
and
keep
men
at
all
times
wide
awake
this
is
a
idea
i
fancy
said
the
quietly
he
had
overheard
the
idiot
confidences
as
revealed
to
the
genial
imbiber
regarding
the
sources
of
some
of
his
ideas
not
at
all
returned
the
idiot
these
ideas
are
beef
not
they
are
the
result
of
much
thought
if
you
will
put
your
mind
on
the
subject
you
will
see
for
yourself
that
there
is
more
in
my
theory
than
there
is
in
yours
the
prosperity
of
a
locality
is
the
greater
as
the
noise
in
its
vicinity
increases
it
is
in
the
quiet
neighborhood
that
man
stagnates
where
do
we
find
great
business
houses
where
do
we
find
great
fortunes
made
where
do
we
find
the
busy
bees
who
make
the
honey
that
enables
posterity
to
get
into
society
and
do
nothing
do
we
pick
up
our
millions
on
the
cowpath
i
guess
not
do
we
erect
our
most
princely
business
houses
along
the
roads
laid
out
by
our
bovine
sister
i
think
not
does
the
man
who
goes
from
the
towpath
to
the
white
house
take
the
short
cut
i
fancy
not
he
goes
over
the
block
pavement
he
seeks
the
home
of
the
noisy
clattering
street
before
he
lands
in
the
shoes
of
washington
the
man
who
sticks
to
the
cowpath
may
be
able
to
drink
milk
but
he
never
wears
diamonds
all
that
you
say
is
very
true
but
it
is
not
based
on
any
fundamental
principle
it
is
so
because
it
happens
to
be
so
returned
the
if
it
were
man
habit
to
have
the
streets
laid
out
on
the
old
cowpath
principle
in
his
cities
he
would
be
quite
as
energetic
quite
as
prosperous
as
he
is
now
no
fundamental
principle
involved
there
is
the
fundamental
principle
of
all
business
success
involved
said
the
idiot
warming
up
to
his
subject
what
is
the
basic
quality
in
the
good
business
man
alertness
what
is
in
this
town
it
is
impossible
for
a
man
to
sleep
after
a
stated
hour
and
for
no
other
reason
than
that
the
clatter
of
the
pavements
prevents
him
as
a
promoter
of
alertness
where
is
your
cowpath
the
cowpaths
of
the
catskills
and
we
all
know
the
mountains
are
riddled
by
did
keep
rip
van
winkle
awake
and
i
wager
whitechoker
here
a
year
board
that
there
is
a
man
in
his
congregation
who
can
sleep
a
much
less
twenty
years
with
broadway
within
hearing
distance
i
tell
you
pedagog
he
continued
it
is
the
man
from
the
cowpath
who
gets
buncoed
it
the
man
from
the
cowpath
who
ca
make
a
living
even
out
of
what
he
calls
his
york
store
it
is
the
man
from
the
cowpath
who
rejoices
because
he
can
sell
ten
dollars
worth
of
for
five
dollars
and
is
happy
when
he
goes
to
meeting
dressed
up
in
a
suit
of
clothes
that
has
cost
him
twenty
your
theory
my
young
friend
observed
the
is
as
fragile
as
this
cup
tapping
his
the
countryman
of
whom
you
speak
is
up
and
doing
long
before
you
or
i
or
your
successful
merchant
who
has
waxed
great
on
noise
as
you
put
it
is
awake
if
the
early
bird
catches
the
worm
what
becomes
of
your
theory
the
early
bird
does
get
the
bait
replied
the
idiot
but
he
does
not
catch
the
fish
and
i
offer
the
board
another
wager
that
the
belgian
block
merchant
is
wider
awake
at
when
he
first
opens
his
eyes
than
his
suburban
brother
who
gets
up
at
five
is
all
day
it
the
extent
to
which
the
eyes
are
opened
that
counts
and
as
for
your
statement
that
the
fact
that
prosperity
and
noisy
streets
go
hand
in
hand
is
true
only
because
it
happens
to
be
so
that
is
an
argument
which
may
be
applied
to
any
truth
in
existence
i
am
because
i
happen
to
be
not
because
i
am
you
are
what
you
are
because
you
are
because
if
you
were
not
you
would
not
be
what
you
are
your
logic
is
delightful
said
the
scornfully
i
strive
to
please
replied
the
idiot
but
i
do
agree
with
the
bibliomaniac
that
our
streets
are
far
from
perfection
he
added
in
my
opinion
they
should
be
laid
in
strata
on
the
should
be
the
sewers
and
telegraph
pipes
above
this
should
be
the
then
a
layer
for
trucks
then
a
broad
stratum
for
carriages
above
which
should
be
a
promenade
for
pedestrians
the
promenade
for
pedestrians
should
be
divided
into
four
sections
one
for
persons
of
leisure
one
for
those
in
a
hurry
one
for
peddlers
and
one
for
beggars
highly
original
said
the
bibliomaniac
and
so
cheap
added
the
in
no
part
of
the
world
said
the
idiot
in
response
to
the
last
comment
do
we
get
something
for
nothing
of
course
this
scheme
would
be
costly
but
it
would
increase
prosperity
ha
ha
laughed
the
satirically
laugh
away
but
you
can
not
gainsay
my
point
our
prosperity
would
increase
for
we
should
not
be
always
excavating
to
get
at
our
pipes
our
surface
cars
with
a
clear
track
would
gain
for
us
rapid
transit
our
would
not
be
subjected
to
the
temptations
of
stopping
by
the
to
overturn
a
coupé
or
to
run
down
a
pedestrian
our
fine
equipages
would
in
consequence
need
fewer
repairs
and
as
for
the
pedestrians
the
beggars
if
relegated
to
themselves
would
be
forced
out
of
business
as
would
also
the
the
men
in
a
hurry
would
not
be
delayed
by
loungers
beggars
and
peddlers
and
the
loungers
would
derive
inestimable
benefit
from
the
arrangement
in
the
saving
of
wear
and
tear
on
their
clothes
and
minds
by
contact
with
the
busy
world
it
would
be
delightful
acceded
the
particularly
on
sundays
when
they
were
all
loungers
yes
replied
the
idiot
it
would
be
delightful
then
especially
in
summer
when
covered
with
an
awning
to
shield
promenaders
from
the
sun
pedagog
sighed
and
the
bibliomaniac
wearily
declining
a
second
cup
of
coffee
left
the
table
with
the
doctor
earnestly
discussing
with
that
worthy
gentleman
the
causes
of
weakmindedness
viii
there
a
friend
of
mine
up
near
riverdale
said
the
idiot
as
he
unfolded
his
napkin
and
let
his
bill
flutter
from
it
to
the
floor
who
tried
to
make
a
name
for
himself
in
literature
what
his
name
asked
the
bibliomaniac
interested
at
once
that
just
the
trouble
he
has
made
it
yet
replied
the
idiot
he
has
succeeded
in
his
courtship
of
the
muse
and
beyond
himself
and
a
few
friends
his
name
is
utterly
unknown
what
work
has
he
tried
queried
the
pouring
unadmonished
two
portions
of
skimmed
milk
over
his
oatmeal
a
little
of
everything
first
he
wrote
a
novel
it
had
an
immense
circulation
and
he
only
lost
on
it
all
of
his
friends
took
a
copy
i
got
one
that
he
gave
me
and
i
believe
two
hundred
newspapers
were
fortunate
enough
to
secure
the
book
for
review
his
father
bought
two
and
tried
to
obtain
the
balance
of
the
edition
but
did
have
enough
money
that
was
gratifying
but
gratification
is
more
apt
to
deplete
than
to
strengthen
a
bank
account
i
had
not
expected
so
extraordinarily
wise
an
observation
from
one
so
unusually
unwise
said
the
coldly
thank
you
returned
the
idiot
but
i
think
your
remark
is
rather
contradictory
you
would
naturally
expect
wise
observations
from
the
unusually
unwise
that
is
if
your
teaching
that
the
expression
unwise
is
but
another
form
of
the
expression
is
correct
but
as
i
was
saying
when
the
genial
instructor
of
youth
interrupted
me
with
his
flattery
continued
the
idiot
gratification
is
gratifying
but
not
filling
so
my
friend
concluded
that
he
had
better
give
up
and
try
jokes
he
kept
at
that
a
year
and
managed
to
clear
his
his
jokes
were
good
but
too
classic
for
the
tastes
of
the
editors
editors
are
peculiar
they
have
no
respect
for
age
particularly
in
the
matter
of
jests
some
of
my
jokes
had
seemed
good
enough
for
plutarch
to
print
when
he
had
a
publisher
at
his
mercy
but
they
did
seem
to
suit
the
high
and
mighty
products
of
this
age
who
sit
in
judgment
on
such
things
in
the
offices
so
he
gave
up
jokes
illustration
wooing
the
muse
does
he
still
know
you
asked
the
landlady
yes
madame
observed
the
idiot
then
he
has
given
up
all
jokes
she
retorted
with
fine
scorn
laughed
the
pretty
good
smithers
pretty
good
yes
said
the
idiot
that
is
good
and
by
jove
it
differs
from
your
butter
smithers
because
it
entirely
fresh
it
good
enough
to
print
and
i
do
think
the
butter
is
what
did
your
friend
do
next
asked
whitechoker
he
was
employed
by
a
funeral
director
in
philadelphia
to
write
obituary
verses
for
memorial
cards
and
was
he
successful
for
a
time
but
he
lost
his
position
because
of
an
error
made
by
a
careless
compositor
in
a
he
had
written
lies
the
hero
of
a
hundred
fights
approximated
he
a
perfect
man
he
fought
for
country
and
his
country
rights
and
in
the
hottest
battles
led
the
van
fine
in
sentiment
and
in
execution
observed
whitechoker
truly
so
returned
the
idiot
but
when
the
compositor
in
the
got
it
engraved
on
the
monument
my
friend
was
away
and
when
the
army
post
that
was
to
pay
the
bill
received
the
monument
the
quatrain
read
lies
the
hero
of
a
hundred
flights
approximated
he
a
perfect
one
he
fought
his
country
and
his
country
rights
and
in
the
hottest
battles
led
the
run
awful
ejaculated
the
minister
dreadful
said
the
landlady
forgetting
to
be
sarcastic
what
happened
asked
the
he
was
bounced
of
course
without
a
cent
of
pay
and
the
company
failed
the
next
week
so
he
could
make
anything
by
suing
for
what
they
owed
him
mighty
hard
luck
said
the
bibliomaniac
very
but
there
was
one
bright
side
to
the
case
observed
the
idiot
he
managed
to
sell
both
versions
of
the
quatrain
afterwards
for
five
dollars
he
sold
the
original
one
to
a
religious
weekly
for
a
dollar
and
got
four
dollars
for
the
other
one
from
a
comic
paper
then
he
wrote
an
anecdote
about
the
whole
thing
for
a
sunday
newspaper
and
got
three
dollars
more
out
of
it
and
what
is
your
friend
doing
now
asked
the
doctor
oh
he
making
a
mint
of
money
now
but
no
name
in
literature
yes
he
writes
advertisements
on
salary
returned
the
idiot
he
is
writing
now
a
recommendation
of
in
indian
dialect
why
did
he
try
writing
an
epic
said
the
bibliomaniac
illustration
gave
up
jokes
because
replied
the
idiot
the
one
aim
of
his
life
has
been
to
be
original
and
he
could
reconcile
that
with
epic
poetry
at
which
remark
the
landlady
stooped
over
and
recovering
the
bill
from
under
the
table
called
the
maid
and
ostentatiously
requested
her
to
hand
it
to
the
idiot
he
taking
a
cigarette
from
his
pocket
thanked
the
maid
for
the
attention
and
rolling
the
slip
into
a
taper
thoughtfully
stuck
one
end
of
it
into
the
alcohol
light
under
the
and
lighting
the
cigarette
with
it
walked
nonchalantly
from
the
room
ix
i
just
been
reading
a
book
began
the
idiot
i
thought
you
looked
rather
pale
said
the
yes
returned
the
idiot
cheerfully
it
made
me
feel
pale
it
was
about
the
pleasures
of
country
life
and
when
i
contrasted
rural
blessedness
as
it
was
there
depicted
with
urban
life
as
we
live
it
i
felt
as
if
my
youth
were
being
thrown
away
i
still
feel
as
if
i
were
wasting
my
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
why
do
you
move
queried
the
bibliomaniac
suggestively
if
i
were
purely
selfish
i
should
do
so
at
once
but
i
am
like
my
good
friend
whitechoker
a
slave
to
duty
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
stay
here
to
keep
the
fully
informed
in
the
various
branches
of
knowledge
which
are
day
by
day
opened
up
many
of
which
seem
to
be
so
far
beyond
the
reach
of
one
of
his
conservative
habits
to
assist
whitechoker
in
his
crusades
against
vice
at
this
table
and
elsewhere
to
give
the
bibliomaniac
the
benefit
of
my
advice
in
regard
to
those
precious
little
tomes
he
no
longer
buys
to
make
life
worth
the
living
for
all
of
you
to
say
nothing
of
enabling
smithers
to
keep
up
the
extraordinarily
high
standard
of
this
house
by
means
of
the
stipend
i
pay
to
her
every
monday
morning
every
monday
queried
the
every
monday
returned
the
idiot
that
is
of
course
every
monday
that
i
pay
the
things
one
gets
to
eat
in
the
country
the
air
one
breathes
the
utter
freedom
from
restraint
the
thousand
and
more
things
one
enjoys
in
the
suburbs
that
are
not
attainable
here
it
is
these
that
make
my
heart
yearn
for
the
open
illustration
little
garden
of
my
own
where
i
could
raise
an
occasional
can
of
tomatoes
well
it
all
rot
said
the
impatiently
country
life
is
ideal
only
in
books
books
do
not
tell
of
running
for
trains
through
blinding
snowstorms
writers
do
not
expatiate
on
the
delights
of
waking
on
cold
winter
nights
and
finding
your
piano
and
parlor
furniture
afloat
because
of
bursted
pipes
with
the
plumber
like
sheridan
at
winchester
twenty
miles
away
they
are
dumb
on
the
subject
of
the
ecstasy
one
feels
when
pushing
a
up
and
down
a
weed
patch
at
the
end
of
a
wearisome
hot
summer
day
they
are
silent
do
get
excited
pedagog
please
interrupted
the
idiot
i
am
not
contemplating
leaving
you
and
smithers
but
i
do
pine
for
a
little
garden
of
my
own
where
i
could
raise
an
occasional
can
of
tomatoes
i
dream
sometimes
of
getting
milk
fresh
from
the
pump
instead
of
hours
after
it
has
been
drawn
as
we
do
here
in
my
musings
it
seems
to
me
to
be
almost
idyllic
to
have
known
a
spring
chicken
in
his
infancy
to
have
watched
a
of
lamb
gambolling
about
its
native
heath
before
its
muscles
became
adamant
and
before
celery
tops
steeped
in
vinegar
were
poured
upon
it
in
the
hope
of
hypnotizing
boarders
into
the
belief
that
spring
lamb
and
lay
before
them
what
care
i
how
hard
it
is
to
rise
every
morning
before
six
in
winter
to
thaw
out
the
boiler
so
long
as
the
night
coming
finds
me
seated
in
the
genial
glow
of
the
gas
log
what
man
is
he
that
would
complain
of
having
to
bale
out
his
cellar
every
week
if
on
the
other
hand
that
cellar
gains
thereby
a
fertility
that
keeps
its
floor
sheeny
soft
and
green
an
interior
from
spring
to
spring
causing
the
gladsome
click
of
the
to
be
heard
within
its
walls
all
through
the
still
watches
of
the
winter
day
i
tell
you
sir
it
is
the
life
to
lead
that
of
our
rural
brother
i
do
not
believe
that
in
this
whole
vast
city
there
is
a
cellar
like
that
an
as
it
were
illustration
of
lamb
gambolling
about
its
native
heath
no
returned
the
doctor
and
it
is
a
good
thing
there
is
there
is
enough
sickness
in
the
world
without
bringing
any
of
your
ideas
i
lived
in
the
country
sir
and
i
assure
you
it
is
not
what
it
is
written
up
to
be
country
life
is
misery
melancholy
and
malaria
you
must
have
struck
a
profitable
section
doctor
returned
the
idiot
taking
possession
of
three
steaming
buckwheat
cakes
to
the
dismay
of
whitechoker
who
was
about
to
reach
out
for
them
himself
and
i
should
have
supposed
that
your
good
business
sense
would
have
restrained
you
from
leaving
then
the
countryman
is
poor
always
poor
continued
the
doctor
ignoring
the
idiot
sarcastic
comments
ah
that
accounts
for
it
observed
the
idiot
i
see
why
you
did
not
stay
for
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
to
save
a
patient
if
practice
like
virtue
is
to
be
its
own
reward
your
suggestion
sir
retorted
the
doctor
betrays
an
unhealthy
frame
of
mind
that
all
right
doctor
returned
the
idiot
but
please
do
not
diagnose
the
case
any
further
i
ca
afford
an
expert
opinion
as
to
my
mental
condition
but
to
return
to
our
subject
you
two
gentlemen
appear
to
have
had
unhappy
experiences
in
country
life
quite
different
from
those
of
a
friend
of
mine
who
owns
a
farm
he
does
have
to
run
for
trains
he
is
independent
of
plumbers
because
the
only
pipes
in
his
house
are
for
smoking
purposes
the
farm
produces
corn
enough
to
keep
his
family
supplied
all
the
year
round
and
to
sell
a
balance
at
a
profit
oats
and
wheat
are
harvested
to
an
extent
which
keeps
the
cattle
and
declares
dividends
besides
he
never
suffers
from
the
cold
or
heat
he
is
never
afraid
of
losing
his
house
or
barns
by
fire
because
the
whole
fire
department
of
the
neighboring
village
is
to
a
man
in
love
with
the
daughter
and
is
always
on
hand
in
force
the
chickens
are
the
envy
and
pride
of
the
county
and
there
are
so
many
of
them
that
they
have
to
take
turns
in
going
to
roost
the
pigs
are
the
most
intelligent
of
their
kind
and
are
so
happy
they
never
grunt
in
fact
everything
is
lovely
and
cheap
the
only
thing
that
hangs
high
being
the
goose
illustration
gladsome
click
of
the
quite
an
ideal
no
doubt
put
in
the
scornfully
i
suppose
his
is
one
of
those
model
farms
with
under
the
walks
to
melt
the
snow
in
winter
and
of
course
there
is
a
vein
of
coal
growing
right
up
into
his
furnace
ready
to
be
lit
yes
observed
the
bibliomaniac
and
no
doubt
the
chickens
lay
eggs
in
every
style
poached
fried
scrambled
and
boiled
the
weeds
in
the
garden
grow
so
fast
i
suppose
that
they
pull
themselves
up
by
the
roots
and
if
there
is
anything
left
undone
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
presume
tramps
in
dress
suits
and
courtly
in
manner
spring
out
of
the
ground
and
finish
up
for
him
i
bet
he
not
on
good
terms
with
his
neighbors
if
he
has
everything
you
speak
of
in
such
perfection
these
farmers
get
frightfully
jealous
of
each
other
asserted
the
doctor
with
a
positiveness
that
seemed
to
be
born
of
experience
he
never
quarrelled
with
one
of
them
in
his
life
returned
the
idiot
he
does
know
them
well
enough
to
quarrel
with
them
in
fact
i
doubt
if
he
ever
sees
them
at
all
he
very
exclusive
of
course
he
is
a
born
farmer
to
get
everything
the
way
he
has
it
suggested
smithers
no
he
is
he
a
broker
said
the
idiot
and
a
very
successful
one
i
see
him
on
the
street
every
day
does
he
employ
a
man
to
run
the
farm
asked
the
clergyman
no
returned
the
idiot
he
has
too
much
sense
and
too
few
dollars
to
do
any
such
foolish
thing
as
that
it
must
be
one
of
those
stock
farms
put
in
the
scornfully
but
i
do
see
how
he
can
be
a
successful
broker
and
make
money
off
his
farm
at
the
same
time
your
statements
do
not
agree
either
you
said
he
never
had
to
run
for
trains
well
he
never
has
returned
the
idiot
calmly
he
never
goes
near
his
farm
he
does
have
to
it
leased
to
the
husband
of
the
whose
daughter
has
a
crush
on
the
fire
department
he
takes
his
pay
in
produce
and
gets
more
than
if
he
took
it
in
cash
on
the
basis
of
the
new
york
vegetable
market
then
you
have
got
us
into
an
argument
about
country
life
that
ends
began
the
indignantly
that
ends
where
it
leaves
off
retorted
the
idiot
departing
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
he
an
idiot
from
idaho
asserted
the
bibliomaniac
yes
but
i
afraid
idiocy
is
a
little
contagious
observed
the
doctor
with
a
grin
and
sidelong
glance
at
the
x
gentlemen
said
the
idiot
as
he
seated
himself
at
the
and
glanced
over
his
mail
yourself
returned
the
poet
you
have
an
unusually
large
number
of
letters
this
morning
all
checks
i
hope
yes
replied
the
idiot
all
checks
of
one
kind
or
another
mostly
checks
on
ambition
otherwise
rejections
from
my
friends
the
editors
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
write
for
the
papers
put
in
the
with
an
incredulous
smile
i
try
to
returned
the
idiot
meekly
if
the
papers
do
take
i
find
them
useful
in
curing
my
genial
friend
who
imbibes
of
insomnia
what
do
you
write
advertisements
queried
the
bibliomaniac
no
advertisement
writing
is
an
art
to
which
i
dare
not
aspire
too
great
a
tax
on
the
brain
replied
the
idiot
tax
on
what
asked
the
doctor
he
was
going
to
squelch
the
idiot
the
brain
returned
the
latter
not
ready
to
be
squelched
it
a
little
thing
people
use
to
think
with
doctor
i
advise
you
to
get
one
then
he
added
i
write
poems
and
foreign
letters
mostly
i
did
not
know
that
you
had
ever
been
abroad
said
the
clergyman
illustration
do
mean
to
say
that
you
write
for
the
papers
i
never
have
returned
the
idiot
then
how
may
i
ask
said
whitechoker
severely
how
can
you
write
foreign
letters
with
my
stub
pen
of
course
replied
the
idiot
how
did
you
suppose
with
an
the
clergyman
sighed
i
should
like
to
hear
some
of
your
poems
said
the
poet
very
well
returned
the
idiot
here
one
that
has
just
returned
from
the
it
about
a
writer
who
died
some
years
ago
shakespeare
his
name
you
heard
of
shakespeare
have
you
mr
pedagog
he
added
then
as
there
was
no
answer
he
read
the
verse
which
was
as
follows
settled
yes
shakespeare
wrote
the
plays
is
clear
to
me
lord
bacon
claim
condemned
before
the
bar
he
not
have
penned
what
fools
these
mortals
be
but
more
correct
what
fools
these
mortals
are
that
not
bad
said
the
poet
illustration
wooed
the
maid
thanks
returned
the
idiot
i
wish
you
were
an
editor
i
wrote
that
last
spring
and
it
has
been
coming
back
to
me
at
the
rate
of
once
a
week
ever
since
it
is
too
short
said
the
bibliomaniac
it
an
epigram
said
the
idiot
how
many
yards
long
do
you
think
epigrams
should
be
the
bibliomaniac
scorned
to
reply
i
agree
with
the
bibliomaniac
said
the
it
is
too
short
people
want
greater
quantity
well
here
is
quantity
for
you
said
the
idiot
quantity
as
she
is
not
wanted
by
nine
comic
papers
i
wot
of
this
poem
is
called
the
turning
of
the
worm
hard
my
fate
perhaps
you
gather
in
my
dearest
reader
when
i
tell
you
that
i
entered
into
this
fair
world
a
twin
the
one
was
spare
enough
the
other
fat
was
of
course
the
lean
one
of
the
two
the
homelier
as
well
and
consequently
in
ecstasy
jim
my
parents
flew
and
good
of
me
was
spoken
boys
we
went
to
school
and
jim
of
course
was
his
teacher
favorite
and
ranked
among
the
lads
renowned
for
moral
force
whilst
i
was
every
day
right
soundly
spanked
had
an
angel
face
but
there
he
stopped
i
never
knew
a
lad
who
sin
so
oft
and
look
so
like
a
branch
of
heaven
lopped
from
off
the
parent
trunk
that
grows
aloft
seemed
an
imp
indeed
was
often
said
that
i
resembled
much
beelzebub
my
face
was
freckled
and
my
hair
was
red
the
kind
of
looking
boy
that
men
call
scrub
deeds
however
were
my
constant
thought
in
everything
i
did
the
best
i
could
i
said
my
prayers
thrice
daily
and
i
sought
in
all
my
ways
to
do
the
right
and
good
saturdays
i
do
my
monday
sums
while
jim
would
spend
the
day
in
search
of
fun
he
sneak
away
and
steal
the
neighbors
plums
and
strange
to
say
to
earth
was
never
run
i
when
was
haply
through
would
seek
my
brother
in
the
neighbor
orchard
would
find
the
neighbor
there
with
anger
blue
and
as
the
thieving
culprit
would
be
tortured
sums
i
done
he
steal
this
lad
forsaken
then
change
my
work
so
that
a
paltry
four
would
be
my
mark
whilst
he
had
overtaken
the
maximum
and
all
the
prizes
bore
later
years
we
loved
the
maid
we
sent
her
little
presents
sweets
bouquets
for
which
alas
was
i
that
always
paid
and
jim
the
maid
now
honors
and
obeys
entered
politics
in
different
roles
and
for
a
minor
office
each
did
run
was
i
was
left
left
badly
at
the
polls
because
of
fishy
things
that
jim
had
done
jim
went
into
business
and
failed
i
signed
his
notes
and
freed
him
from
the
strife
which
bankruptcy
and
ruin
hath
entailed
on
them
that
lead
a
queer
financial
life
penniless
i
learned
that
jim
had
set
aside
before
his
failure
hard
to
tell
a
half
a
million
dollars
on
his
pet
his
jim
the
former
lovely
nell
wearied
me
of
jim
it
may
be
right
for
one
to
bear
another
cross
but
i
quite
fail
to
see
it
in
its
proper
light
if
that
the
rule
man
should
be
guided
by
since
a
fate
perverse
has
had
the
wit
to
mix
us
up
so
that
the
one
deserts
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
other
sit
no
matter
how
the
other
one
it
hurts
am
resolved
to
take
some
mortal
life
just
when
or
where
or
how
i
do
not
reck
so
long
as
law
will
end
this
horrid
strife
and
twist
my
dear
twin
brother
sinful
neck
there
said
the
idiot
putting
down
the
manuscript
how
that
i
do
like
it
said
whitechoker
it
is
immoral
and
vindictive
you
should
accept
the
hardships
of
life
no
matter
how
unjust
the
conclusion
of
your
poem
horrifies
me
sir
i
illustration
curing
insomnia
have
you
tried
your
hand
at
dialect
poetry
asked
the
doctor
yes
once
said
the
idiot
i
sent
it
to
the
western
oh
yes
here
it
is
sent
back

away
ingenious
but
vicious
said
the
who
does
not
smoke
again
thanks
how
is
this
for
a
sonnet
said
the
idiot
to
the
sessions
of
sweet
silent
thought
i
summon
up
remembrance
of
things
past
i
sigh
the
lack
of
many
a
thing
i
sought
and
with
old
woes
new
wail
my
dear
time
waste
then
can
i
drown
an
eye
unused
to
flow
for
precious
friends
hid
in
death
dateless
night
and
weep
afresh
love
long
since
cancel
woe
and
moan
the
expense
of
many
a
vanish
sight
then
can
i
grieve
at
grievances
foregone
and
heavily
from
woe
to
woe
tell
the
sad
account
of
moan
which
i
now
pay
as
if
not
paid
before
but
if
the
while
i
think
of
thee
dear
friend
all
losses
are
restored
and
sorrows
end
it
is
bosh
said
the
the
poet
smiled
quietly
perfect
bosh
repeated
the
and
only
shows
how
in
weak
hands
so
beautiful
a
thing
as
the
sonnet
can
be
made
ridiculous
what
wrong
with
it
asked
the
idiot
it
does
contain
any
thought
or
if
it
does
no
one
can
tell
what
the
thought
is
your
rhymes
are
atrocious
your
phraseology
is
ridiculous
the
whole
thing
is
bad
you
never
get
anybody
to
print
it
i
do
not
intend
to
try
said
the
idiot
meekly
you
are
wise
said
the
to
take
my
advice
for
once
no
it
is
not
your
advice
that
restrains
me
said
the
idiot
dryly
it
is
the
fact
that
this
sonnet
has
already
been
printed
in
the
name
of
letters
where
cried
the
in
the
collected
works
of
william
shakespeare
replied
the
idiot
quietly
the
poet
laughed
smithers
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
the
for
once
had
absolutely
nothing
to
say
xi
do
you
believe
whitechoker
said
the
idiot
taking
his
place
at
the
table
and
holding
his
plate
up
to
the
light
apparently
to
see
whether
or
not
it
was
immaculate
whereat
the
landlady
sniffed
contemptuously
do
you
believe
that
the
love
of
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
i
have
always
been
of
that
impression
returned
whitechoker
pleasantly
in
fact
i
am
sure
of
it
he
added
there
is
no
evil
thing
in
this
world
sir
that
can
not
be
traced
back
to
a
point
where
greed
is
found
to
be
its
and
the
source
of
its
strength
then
how
do
you
reconcile
this
with
the
scriptural
story
of
the
forbidden
fruit
do
you
think
the
apples
referred
to
were
figures
of
speech
the
true
import
of
which
was
that
adam
and
eve
had
their
eyes
on
the
original
surplus
well
of
course
there
you
begin
to
ah
you
seem
to
me
to
be
going
back
to
the
er
the
ah
original
root
of
all
evil
prompted
the
idiot
calmly
precisely
returned
whitechoker
with
a
sigh
of
relief
smithers
i
think
i
have
a
dash
of
in
my
coffee
this
morning
then
with
a
nervous
glance
towards
the
idiot
he
added
addressing
the
bibliomaniac
i
think
it
looks
like
rain
referring
to
the
coffee
mr
whitechoker
queried
the
idiot
not
disposed
to
let
go
of
his
victim
quite
so
easily
ah
i
do
quite
follow
you
replied
the
minister
with
some
annoyance
you
said
something
looked
like
rain
and
i
asked
you
if
the
thing
you
referred
to
was
the
coffee
for
i
was
disposed
to
agree
with
you
said
the
idiot
i
am
sure
put
in
smithers
that
a
gentleman
of
whitechoker
refinement
would
not
make
any
such
insinuation
sir
he
is
not
the
man
to
quarrel
with
what
is
set
before
him
illustration
holding
his
plate
up
to
the
light
i
ask
your
pardon
madam
returned
the
idiot
politely
i
hope
that
i
am
not
the
man
to
quarrel
with
my
food
either
indeed
i
make
it
a
rule
to
avoid
unpleasantness
of
all
sorts
particularly
with
the
weak
under
which
category
we
find
your
coffee
i
simply
wish
to
know
to
what
whitechoker
refers
when
he
says
looks
like
rain
i
mean
of
course
said
the
minister
with
as
much
calmness
as
he
could
command
and
that
was
not
much
i
mean
the
day
the
day
looks
as
if
it
might
be
rainy
any
one
with
a
modicum
of
brain
knows
what
you
meant
whitechoker
volunteered
the
certainly
observed
the
idiot
scraping
the
butter
from
his
toast
but
to
those
who
have
more
than
a
modicum
of
brains
my
reverend
friend
remark
was
not
entirely
clear
if
i
am
talking
of
cotton
and
a
gentleman
chooses
to
state
that
it
looks
like
snow
i
know
exactly
what
he
means
he
does
mean
that
the
day
looks
like
snow
however
he
refers
to
the
cotton
whitechoker
talking
about
coffee
chooses
to
state
that
it
looks
like
rain
which
it
undoubtedly
does
i
realizing
that
as
smithers
says
it
is
not
the
gentleman
habit
to
attack
too
violently
the
food
which
is
set
before
him
manifest
some
surprise
and
giving
the
gentleman
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
afford
him
an
opportunity
to
set
himself
right
change
the
subject
said
the
bibliomaniac
curtly
with
pleasure
answered
the
idiot
filling
his
glass
with
cream
we
change
the
subject
or
the
object
or
anything
you
choose
have
another
breakfast
or
another
variety
of
biscuits
anything
in
short
to
keep
peace
at
the
table
tell
me
pedagog
he
added
is
the
use
of
the
word
in
the
sentence
looks
like
rain
perfectly
correct
i
do
know
why
it
is
not
returned
the
uneasily
he
was
not
at
all
desirous
of
parleying
with
the
idiot
and
is
it
correct
to
suppose
that
refers
to
the
day
is
the
day
supposed
to
look
like
rain
or
do
we
simply
use
to
express
a
condition
which
confronts
us
it
refers
to
the
latter
of
course
then
the
full
text
of
whitechoker
remark
is
i
suppose
that
rainy
condition
of
the
atmosphere
which
confronts
us
looks
like
rain
oh
i
suppose
so
sighed
the
wearily
rather
an
unnecessary
sort
of
statement
that
continued
the
idiot
it
something
like
asserting
that
a
man
looks
like
himself
or
as
in
the
case
of
a
child
primer
the
cat
i
see
the
cat
is
the
cat
cat
is
a
cat
scat
cat
at
this
even
smithers
smiled
i
do
agree
with
pedagog
put
in
the
bibliomaniac
after
a
pause
here
the
shook
his
head
warningly
at
the
bibliomaniac
as
if
to
indicate
that
he
was
not
in
good
form
so
i
observe
remarked
the
idiot
you
have
upset
him
completely
see
how
pedagog
trembles
he
added
addressing
the
genial
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibed
illustration
believe
you
blow
out
the
gas
in
your
i
do
mean
that
way
sneered
the
bibliomaniac
bound
to
set
whitechoker
straight
i
mean
that
the
word
as
employed
in
that
sentence
stands
for
day
the
day
looks
like
rain
did
you
ever
see
a
day
queried
the
idiot
certainly
i
have
returned
the
bibliomaniac
what
does
it
look
like
was
the
calmly
put
question
the
bibliomaniac
impatience
was
here
almost
too
great
for
safety
and
the
manner
in
which
his
face
colored
aroused
considerable
interest
in
the
breast
of
the
doctor
who
was
a
good
deal
of
a
specialist
in
apoplexy
was
it
a
whole
day
you
saw
or
only
a
persisted
the
idiot
you
may
think
you
are
very
funny
retorted
the
bibliomaniac
i
think
you
are
now
do
get
angry
returned
the
idiot
there
are
two
or
three
things
i
do
not
know
and
i
anxious
to
learn
i
like
to
know
how
a
day
looks
to
one
to
whom
it
is
a
visible
object
if
it
is
visible
is
it
tangible
and
if
so
how
does
it
feel
the
visible
is
always
tangible
asserted
the
recklessly
how
about
a
stove
or
manifest
indignation
or
a
view
from
a
or
as
in
the
case
of
the
young
man
in
the
novel
who
waked
and
anxiously
about
him
saw
no
one
returned
the
idiot
imperturbably
tut
ejaculated
the
bibliomaniac
if
i
had
brains
like
yours
blow
them
out
yes
i
think
you
would
observed
the
idiot
folding
up
his
napkin
you
just
the
man
to
do
a
thing
like
that
i
believe
you
blow
out
the
gas
in
your
bedroom
if
there
was
a
sign
over
it
requesting
you
not
to
and
filling
his
from
the
landlady
mantel
supply
the
idiot
hurried
from
the
room
and
soon
after
left
the
house
xii
if
my
father
had
met
with
reverses
the
idiot
began
did
you
really
have
a
father
interrupted
the
i
thought
you
were
one
of
these
idiots
how
terrible
it
must
be
for
a
man
to
think
that
he
is
responsible
for
you
yes
rejoined
the
idiot
my
father
finds
it
rather
hard
to
stand
up
under
his
responsibility
for
me
but
he
is
a
brave
old
gentleman
and
he
manages
to
bear
the
burden
very
well
with
the
aid
of
my
mother
for
i
have
a
mother
too
pedagog
a
womanly
mother
she
is
too
with
all
the
natural
follies
such
as
fondness
for
and
belief
in
her
boy
why
it
would
soften
your
heart
to
see
how
she
looks
on
me
she
thinks
i
am
the
most
everlastingly
brilliant
man
she
ever
knew
excepting
father
of
course
who
has
always
been
a
hero
of
heroes
in
her
eyes
because
he
never
rails
at
misfortune
never
spoke
an
unkind
word
to
her
in
his
life
and
just
lives
gently
along
and
waiting
for
the
end
of
all
things
illustration
fairy
stories
were
told
him
in
words
of
ten
syllables
do
you
think
it
is
right
in
you
to
deceive
your
mother
in
this
way
making
her
think
you
a
young
napoleon
of
intellect
when
you
know
you
are
an
idiot
observed
the
bibliomaniac
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
why
certainly
i
do
returned
the
idiot
calmly
it
my
place
to
make
the
old
folks
happy
if
i
can
and
if
thinking
me
nineteen
different
kinds
of
a
genius
is
going
to
fill
my
mother
heart
with
happiness
going
to
let
her
think
it
what
the
use
of
destroying
other
idols
even
if
we
do
know
them
to
be
hollow
mockeries
do
you
think
you
do
a
praiseworthy
act
for
instance
when
you
kick
over
the
stone
gods
and
leave
him
without
any
at
all
you
may
not
have
noticed
it
but
i
have
that
it
is
easier
to
pull
down
an
idol
than
it
is
to
rear
an
ideal
i
have
had
idols
shattered
myself
and
i
have
found
that
the
pedestals
they
used
to
occupy
have
been
rented
since
they
are
there
yet
and
empty
standing
as
monuments
to
what
once
seemed
good
to
me
and
i
no
happier
nor
no
better
for
being
disillusioned
so
it
is
with
my
mother
i
let
her
go
on
and
think
me
perfect
it
does
her
good
and
it
does
me
good
because
it
makes
me
try
to
live
up
to
that
idea
of
hers
as
to
what
i
am
if
she
had
the
same
opinion
of
me
that
we
all
have
she
be
the
most
miserable
woman
in
the
world
we
do
all
think
so
badly
of
you
said
the
doctor
rather
softened
by
the
idiot
remarks
no
put
in
the
bibliomaniac
you
are
all
right
you
breathe
normally
and
you
have
nice
blue
eyes
you
are
graceful
and
pleasant
to
look
upon
and
if
you
been
born
dumb
we
esteem
you
very
highly
it
is
only
your
manners
and
your
theories
that
we
do
like
but
even
in
these
we
are
disposed
to
believe
that
you
are
a
child
that
is
precisely
the
way
to
put
it
assented
the
you
are
harmless
even
when
most
annoying
for
my
own
part
i
think
the
most
objectionable
feature
about
you
is
that
you
suffer
from
that
unfortunately
not
uncommon
malady
extreme
youth
you
are
young
for
your
age
and
if
you
only
would
talk
i
think
we
should
get
on
famously
together
you
overwhelm
me
with
your
compliments
said
the
idiot
i
am
sorry
i
am
so
young
but
i
can
not
be
brought
to
believe
that
that
is
my
own
fault
one
must
live
to
attain
age
and
how
the
deuce
can
one
live
when
one
boards
as
no
one
ventured
to
reply
to
this
question
the
force
of
which
very
evidently
however
was
fully
appreciated
by
smithers
the
idiot
continued
illustration
thought
my
father
a
assassin
youth
is
thrust
upon
us
in
our
infancy
and
must
be
endured
until
such
a
time
as
fate
permits
us
to
account
ourselves
cured
it
swoops
down
upon
us
when
we
have
neither
the
strength
nor
the
brains
to
resent
it
of
course
there
are
some
superior
persons
in
this
world
who
never
were
young
pedagog
i
doubt
not
was
ushered
into
this
world
with
all
three
sets
of
teeth
cut
and
not
wailing
as
most
infants
are
but
discussing
the
most
abstruse
philosophical
problems
his
fairy
stories
were
told
him
if
ever
in
words
of
ten
syllables
and
his
first
remark
to
him
was
doubtless
an
inquiry
as
to
his
opinion
on
the
subject
of
latin
and
greek
in
our
colleges
it
all
right
to
be
this
kind
of
a
baby
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
for
my
part
i
rejoice
to
think
that
there
was
once
a
day
when
i
thought
my
father
a
assassin
because
he
would
tie
a
string
to
the
moon
and
let
me
make
it
rise
and
set
as
suited
my
sweet
will
babies
of
pedagog
sort
are
fortunately
like
angel
visits
few
and
far
between
in
spite
of
his
stand
in
the
matter
though
i
ca
help
thinking
there
was
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
a
rhyme
a
friend
of
mine
got
off
on
youth
it
fits
the
case
he
said
is
a
state
of
being
we
attain
in
early
years
to
some
is
but
a
crime
and
like
the
mumps
most
agèd
men
complain
it
ca
be
caught
alas
a
second
time
your
rhymes
are
interesting
and
your
reasoning
as
usual
is
faulty
said
the
i
passed
a
very
pleasant
childhood
though
it
was
a
childhood
devoted
as
you
have
insinuated
to
serious
rather
than
to
flippant
pursuits
i
was
particularly
fond
of
tag
and
nor
do
i
think
that
even
as
an
infant
i
ever
cried
for
the
moon
it
would
have
expanded
your
chest
if
you
had
pedagog
observed
the
idiot
quietly
so
it
would
but
i
never
found
myself
sir
retorted
the
with
some
acerbity
that
is
evident
but
go
on
said
the
idiot
you
never
passed
a
childish
youth
nor
a
youthful
childhood
and
therefore
what
therefore
in
my
present
condition
i
am
normally
contented
i
have
no
youthful
follies
to
look
back
upon
no
indiscretions
to
regret
i
never
knowingly
told
a
lie
and
all
of
which
proves
that
you
never
were
young
put
in
the
idiot
and
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
say
it
but
my
father
is
the
model
for
me
rather
than
so
exalted
a
personage
as
yourself
he
is
still
young
though
turned
seventy
and
i
do
believe
on
his
own
account
there
ever
was
a
boy
who
played
hookey
more
who
prevaricated
oftener
who
purloined
others
fruits
with
greater
frequency
than
he
he
was
guilty
of
every
crime
in
the
calendar
of
youth
and
if
there
is
one
thing
that
delights
him
more
than
another
it
is
to
sit
on
a
winter
night
before
the
crackling
log
and
tell
us
yarns
about
his
youthful
follies
and
his
boyhood
indiscretions
but
is
he
normally
a
happy
man
queried
the
no
ah
no
he
an
happy
man
because
he
got
his
follies
and
indiscretions
to
look
back
upon
and
not
forward
to
ahem
said
smithers
dear
me
ejaculated
whitechoker
pedagog
said
nothing
and
the
was
soon
deserted
xiii
there
was
an
air
of
suppressed
excitement
about
smithers
and
pedagog
as
they
sat
down
to
breakfast
something
had
happened
but
just
what
that
something
was
no
one
as
yet
knew
although
the
genial
old
gentleman
had
a
sort
of
notion
as
to
what
it
was
pedagog
has
been
enough
for
an
engaged
man
for
nearly
a
week
now
he
whispered
to
the
idiot
who
had
asked
him
what
he
supposed
was
up
and
i
have
a
half
idea
that
has
at
last
brought
him
to
the
point
of
proposing
it
the
other
way
i
imagine
returned
the
idiot
you
do
really
think
she
has
rejected
him
do
you
queried
the
genial
old
gentleman
oh
no
not
by
a
great
deal
i
mean
that
i
think
it
very
likely
that
he
has
brought
her
to
the
point
this
is
you
know
said
the
idiot
well
if
i
were
a
betting
man
which
i
have
been
since
night
before
last
i
lay
you
a
wager
that
they
engaged
said
the
old
gentleman
i
glad
you
given
up
betting
rejoined
the
idiot
because
sure
i
take
the
bet
if
you
offered
it
and
then
i
believe
i
lose
we
are
to
have
philadelphia
spring
chickens
this
morning
gentlemen
said
smithers
beaming
upon
all
at
the
table
it
a
special
treat
which
we
all
appreciate
my
dear
smithers
observed
the
idiot
with
a
courteous
bow
to
his
landlady
and
by
the
way
why
is
it
that
philadelphia
spring
chickens
do
not
appear
until
autumn
do
you
suppose
is
it
because
philadelphia
spring
does
come
around
until
it
is
autumn
everywhere
else
no
i
think
not
said
the
doctor
i
think
it
is
because
philadelphia
spring
chickens
are
not
sufficiently
hardened
to
be
able
to
stand
the
strain
of
exportation
much
before
september
or
else
philadelphia
people
do
not
get
so
sated
with
such
delicacies
as
to
permit
any
of
the
crop
to
go
into
other
than
philadelphia
markets
before
that
period
for
my
part
i
simply
love
them
illustration
brought
him
to
the
point
of
proposing
so
do
i
said
the
idiot
and
if
smithers
will
pardon
me
for
expressing
a
preference
for
any
especial
part
of
the
de
i
will
state
to
her
that
if
in
helping
me
she
will
give
me
two
drumsticks
a
pair
of
second
joints
and
plenty
of
the
white
meat
i
shall
be
very
happy
you
ought
to
have
said
so
yesterday
said
the
with
a
surprisingly
genial
laugh
then
smithers
could
have
prepared
an
individual
chicken
for
you
that
would
be
too
much
returned
the
idiot
and
i
should
really
hesitate
to
eat
too
much
spring
chicken
i
never
did
it
in
my
life
and
do
know
what
the
effect
would
be
would
it
be
harmful
doctor
i
really
do
not
know
how
it
would
be
answered
the
doctor
in
all
my
wide
experience
i
have
never
found
a
case
of
the
kind
it
very
rarely
that
one
gets
too
much
spring
chicken
said
whitechoker
i
have
had
any
experience
with
patients
as
my
friend
the
doctor
has
but
i
have
lived
in
many
and
i
have
never
yet
known
of
any
one
even
getting
enough
well
perhaps
we
shall
have
all
we
want
this
morning
said
smithers
i
hope
so
at
any
rate
for
i
wish
this
day
to
be
a
memorable
one
in
our
house
pedagog
has
something
to
tell
you
john
will
you
announce
it
now
did
you
hear
that
whispered
the
idiot
she
called
him
yes
said
the
genial
old
gentleman
i
did
know
pedagog
had
a
first
name
before
certainly
my
dear
that
is
my
very
dear
smithers
stammered
the
getting
red
in
the
face
the
fact
is
gentlemen
ahem
i
er
we
er
that
is
of
course
er
smithers
has
er
ahem
mrs
smithers
has
asked
me
to
be
her
i
er
i
should
say
i
have
asked
smithers
to
be
my
husb
my
wife
and
er
she
hoorah
cried
the
idiot
jumping
up
from
the
table
and
grasping
pedagog
by
the
hand
hoorah
you
got
in
ahead
of
us
old
man
but
we
are
just
as
glad
when
we
think
of
your
your
gain
may
be
our
loss
but
what
of
that
where
the
happiness
of
our
dear
landlady
is
at
stake
smithers
glanced
coyly
at
the
idiot
and
smiled
thank
you
said
the
you
are
welcome
said
the
idiot
smithers
you
will
also
permit
me
to
felicitate
you
upon
this
happy
event
i
who
have
so
often
differed
with
pedagog
upon
matters
of
human
knowledge
am
forced
to
admit
that
upon
this
occasion
he
has
shown
such
eminently
good
sense
that
you
are
fortunate
indeed
to
have
won
him
again
i
thank
you
said
the
you
are
a
very
sensible
person
yourself
my
dear
idiot
perhaps
my
failure
to
appreciate
you
at
times
in
the
past
has
been
due
to
your
brilliant
qualities
which
have
so
dazzled
me
that
i
have
been
unable
to
see
you
as
you
really
are
here
are
the
chickens
said
smithers
ah
ejaculated
the
idiot
what
lucky
fellows
we
are
to
be
sure
i
hope
smithers
now
that
pedagog
has
cut
us
all
out
you
will
at
least
be
a
sister
to
the
rest
of
us
and
let
us
live
at
home
illustration
cried
the
idiot
grasping
pedagog
by
the
hand
there
is
to
be
no
change
said
smithers
at
least
i
hope
not
except
that
pedagog
will
take
a
more
active
part
in
the
management
of
our
home
i
do
envy
him
that
said
the
idiot
we
shall
be
severe
critics
and
it
will
be
hard
work
for
him
to
manage
affairs
better
than
you
did
mrs
smithers
mary
get
me
a
larger
cup
for
the
idiot
coffee
said
smithers
let
all
retire
from
business
suggested
the
idiot
after
the
other
guests
had
expressed
their
satisfaction
with
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
let
retire
from
business
and
change
the
smithers
home
for
boarders
into
an
educational
institution
for
what
purpose
queried
the
bibliomaniac
everything
is
so
lovely
now
explained
the
idiot
that
i
feel
as
though
i
never
wanted
to
leave
the
house
again
even
to
win
a
fortune
if
we
turn
it
into
a
college
and
instruct
youth
we
need
never
go
outside
the
front
door
excepting
for
pleasure
where
will
the
money
and
the
instructors
come
from
asked
whitechoker
money
from
pupils
and
after
we
get
going
maybe
somebody
will
endow
us
as
for
instructors
i
think
we
know
enough
to
be
instructors
ourselves
replied
the
idiot
for
instance
pedagog
university
john
pedagog
president
alonzo
whitechoker
chaplain
matron
for
professor
of
the
bibliomaniac
assisted
by
the
poet
medical
lectures
by
dr
capsule
chemistry
taught
by
our
genial
friend
who
occasionally
imbibes
chair
in
general
information
your
humble
servant
why
we
would
be
overrun
with
pupils
and
money
in
less
than
a
year
a
very
good
idea
returned
pedagog
i
have
often
thought
that
a
nice
little
school
could
be
started
here
to
advantage
though
i
must
confess
that
i
had
different
ideas
on
the
subject
of
the
instructors
you
my
dear
idiot
would
be
a
great
deal
more
useful
as
a
professor
emeritus
hm
said
the
idiot
it
sounds
mighty
well
i
no
doubt
i
should
like
it
what
is
a
professor
emeritus
mr
pedagog
he
is
a
professor
who
is
paid
a
salary
for
doing
nothing
the
whole
table
joined
in
a
laugh
the
idiot
included
by
jove
pedagog
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
you
are
just
dead
right
about
that
that
the
place
of
places
for
me
salary
and
nothing
to
do
oh
how
i
love
it
the
rest
of
the
breakfast
was
eaten
in
silence
the
spring
chickens
were
too
good
and
too
plentiful
to
admit
of
much
waste
of
time
in
conversation
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
the
idiot
rose
from
the
table
and
after
again
congratulating
pedagog
and
his
fiancée
announced
that
he
was
going
to
see
his
employer
on
sunday
queried
smithers
yes
i
want
him
to
write
me
a
recommendation
as
a
man
who
can
do
nothing
beautifully
and
why
pray
asked
pedagog
i
going
to
apply
to
the
trustees
of
columbia
college
the
first
thing
morning
for
an
emeritus
professorship
for
if
anybody
can
do
nothing
and
draw
money
for
it
gracefully
i
the
man
wall
street
is
too
wearing
on
my
nerves
he
replied
and
in
a
moment
he
was
gone
i
him
said
smithers
so
do
i
said
pedagog
he
is
half
the
idiot
he
thinks
he
is

end

the
story
is
a
pathetic
one
in
many
ways
for
it
portrays
so
strongly
human
lowliness
and
degradation
the
writer
is
well
acquainted
with
the
life
and
habits
and
dialect
of
the
west
tennessee
bottoms
and
her
story
is
written
from
the
heart
and
with
rare
sympathy
the
lonely
dyke
roads
the
cheerless
homes
the
shabby
store
the
emotional
methodist
meeting
which
lasts

all
these
are

the

the
story
is
valuable
because
it
shows
so
forcefully
the
peculiar
phases
of
the
life
and
human
character
of
these
people
the
writer
has
a
