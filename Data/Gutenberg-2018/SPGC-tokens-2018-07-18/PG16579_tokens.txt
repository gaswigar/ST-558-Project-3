preface
the
following
twelve
lectures
have
this
much
in
common
with
a
previous
twelve
published
in
under
the
title
on
the
art
of
writing
they
form
no
compact
treatise
but
present
their
central
idea
as
i
was
compelled
at
the
time
to
enforce
it
amid
the
dust
of
skirmishing
with
opponents
and
with
practical
difficulties
they
cover
and
to
some
extent
by
reflection
chronicle
a
period
during
which
a
few
friends
who
had
an
idea
and
believed
in
it
were
fighting
to
establish
the
present
english
tripos
at
cambridge
in
the
end
we
carried
our
proposals
without
a
vote
but
the
opposition
was
stiff
for
a
while
and
i
feared
on
starting
to
read
over
these
pages
for
press
that
they
might
be
too
occasional
and
disputatious
i
am
happy
to
think
that
on
the
whole
they
are
not
and
that
the
reader
though
he
may
wonder
at
its
discursiveness
will
find
the
argument
pretty
free
from
polemic
any
one
who
has
inherited
a
library
of
century
theology
will
agree
with
me
that
of
all
dust
the
ashes
of
dead
controversies
afford
the
driest
and
after
all
and
though
it
be
well
worth
while
to
strive
that
the
study
of
english
of
our
own
literature
and
of
the
art
of
using
our
own
language
in
speech
or
in
writing
to
the
best
purpose
shall
take
an
honourable
place
among
the
schools
of
a
great
university
that
the
other
fair
sisters
of
learning
shall
ope
for
thee
their
queenly
circle
it
is
not
in
our
universities
that
the
general
redemption
of
english
will
be
won
nor
need
a
mistake
here
or
there
at
oxford
or
cambridge
or
london
prove
fatal
we
make
our
discoveries
through
our
mistakes
we
watch
one
another
success
and
where
there
is
freedom
to
experiment
there
is
hope
to
improve
a
youth
who
can
command
means
to
enter
a
university
can
usually
command
some
range
in
choosing
which
university
it
shall
be
if
cambridge
can
not
supply
what
he
wants
or
if
our
standard
of
training
be
low
in
comparison
with
that
of
oxford
or
of
london
or
of
manchester
the
pressure
of
neglect
will
soon
recall
us
to
our
senses
real
battle
for
english
lies
in
our
elementary
schools
and
in
the
training
of
our
elementary
it
is
there
that
the
foundations
of
a
sound
national
teaching
in
english
will
have
to
be
laid
as
it
is
there
that
a
wrong
trend
will
lead
to
incurable
issues
for
the
poor
child
has
no
choice
of
schools
and
the
elementary
teacher
whatever
his
individual
gifts
will
work
under
a
yoke
imposed
upon
him
by
whitehall
i
devoutly
trust
that
whitehall
will
make
the
yoke
easy
and
adaptable
while
insisting
that
the
chariot
must
be
drawn
i
foresee
then
these
lectures
condemned
as
the
utterances
of
a
man
who
occupying
a
chair
has
contrived
to
fall
betwixt
two
stools
my
thoughts
have
too
often
strayed
from
my
audience
in
a
university
theatre
away
to
remote
rural
where
the
hungry
sheep
look
up
and
are
not
fed
to
piteous
groups
of
urchins
standing
at
attention
and
chanting
the
wreck
of
the
hesperus
in
unison
yet
to
these
being
tied
to
the
place
and
the
occasion
i
have
brought
no
real
help
a
man
has
to
perform
his
task
as
it
comes
but
i
must
say
this
in
conclusion
could
i
wipe
these
lectures
out
and
them
in
hope
to
benefit
my
countrymen
in
general
i
should
begin
and
end
upon
the
text
to
be
found
in
the
twelfth
and
last
that
a
liberal
education
is
not
an
appendage
to
be
purchased
by
a
few
that
humanism
is
rather
a
which
can
and
should
condition
all
our
teaching
which
can
and
should
be
impressed
as
a
character
upon
it
all

in

and

chapter
aristotle
dealing
with
certain
actions
which
though
bad
in
themselves
admit
of
pity
and
forgiveness
because
they
were
committed
involuntarily
through
ignorance
instances
man
who
did
not
know
a
subject
was
forbidden
like
aeschylus
with
the
mysteries
and
man
who
only
meant
to
show
how
it
worked
like
the
fellow
who
let
off
the
catapult
greek
e
deixai
boulemos

os
o
ton

i
feel
comfortably
sure
gentlemen
that
in
a
previous
course
of
lectures
on
the
art
of
writing
unlike
aeschylus
i
divulged
no
mysteries
but
i
am
troubled
with
speculations
over
that
man
and
the
catapult
because
i
really
was
trying
to
tell
you
how
the
thing
worked
and
aristotle
with
a
reticence
which
as
horace
afterwards
noted
may
lend
itself
to
obscurity
tells
us
neither
what
happened
to
that
exponent
of
ballistics
nor
to
the
engine
itself
nor
to
the
other
person
my
discharge
such
as
it
was
at
any
rate
provoked
another
professor
learned
sagacious
venerable
to
retort
that
the
true
business
of
a
chair
such
as
this
is
to
instruct
young
men
how
to
rather
than
how
to
write
well
be
it
so
i
accept
the
challenge
i
propose
in
this
and
some
ensuing
lectures
to
talk
of
the
art
and
practice
of
reading
particularly
as
applied
to
english
literature
to
discuss
on
what
ground
and
through
what
faculties
an
author
and
his
reader
meet
to
enquire
if
or
to
what
extent
reading
of
the
best
literature
can
be
taught
and
supposing
it
to
be
taught
if
or
to
what
extent
it
can
be
examined
upon
with
maybe
an
interlude
or
two
to
beguile
the
way
ii
the
first
thing
then
to
be
noted
about
the
reading
of
english
with
which
alone
i
am
concerned
is
that
for
englishmen
it
has
been
made
by
act
of
parliament
compulsory
the
next
thing
to
be
noted
is
that
in
our
schools
and
colleges
and
universities
it
has
been
made
by
statute
or
in
practice
all
but
impossible
the
third
step
is
obvious
to
reconcile
what
we
can
not
do
with
what
we
must
and
to
that
aim
i
shall
under
your
patience
direct
this
and
the
following
lecture
i
shall
be
relieved
at
all
events
and
from
the
outset
of
the
doubt
by
which
many
a
professor
here
and
elsewhere
has
been
haunted
i
mean
the
doubt
whether
there
really
such
a
subject
as
that
of
which
he
proposes
to
treat
anything
that
requires
so
much
human
ingenuity
as
reading
english
in
an
english
university
be
an
art
iii
but
i
shall
be
met
of
course
by
the
question
is
the
reading
of
english
made
impossible
at
cambridge
and
i
pause
here
on
the
edge
of
my
subject
to
clear
away
that
doubt
it
is
no
fault
of
the
university
the
late
philip
gilbert
hamerton
whom
some
remember
as
an
etcher
wrote
a
book
which
he
entitled
as
i
think
too
magniloquently
the
intellectual
life
he
cast
it
in
the
form
of
letters
an
author
who
kept
very
irregular
hours
a
young
etonian
who
thought
of
becoming
a
a
young
gentleman
who
had
firmly
resolved
never
to
wear
anything
but
a
grey
coat
but
mr
hamerton
could
quite
have
meant
that
a
lady
of
high
culture
who
found
it
difficult
to
associate
with
persons
of
her
own
sex
a
young
gentleman
of
intellectual
tastes
who
without
having
as
yet
any
particular
lady
in
view
had
expressed
in
a
general
way
his
determination
to
get
married
the
volume
is
well
worth
reading
in
the
first
letter
of
all
addressed
a
young
man
of
letters
who
worked
excessively
mr
hamerton
fishes
up
from
his
memory
for
admonishment
this
salutary
instance
a
tradesman
whose
business
affords
an
excellent
outlet
for
energetic
bodily
activity
told
me
that
having
attempted
in
addition
to
his
ordinary
work
to
acquire
a
foreign
language
which
seemed
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
he
had
been
obliged
to
abandon
it
on
account
of
alarming
cerebral
symptoms
this
man
has
immense
vigour
and
energy
but
the
digestive
functions
in
this
instance
are
sluggish
however
when
he
abandoned
study
the
cerebral
inconveniences
disappeared
and
have
never
returned
since
iv
now
we
all
know
and
understand
and
like
that
man
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
is
every
one
of
us
you
or
i
say
have
to
take
the
modern
languages
tripos
section
a
english
in
first
of
all
and
rightly
it
is
demanded
of
us
that
we
show
an
acquaintance
and
something
more
than
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
shakespeare
very
well
but
next
we
have
to
write
a
paper
and
answer
questions
on
the
outlines
of
english
literature
from
to
almost
years
and
next
to
write
a
paper
and
show
particular
knowledge
of
english
literature
between
and
years
next
comes
a
paper
on
passages
from
selected
english
verse
and
prose
writings
the
statute
discreetly
avoids
calling
them
literature
between
and
exclusive
of
chaucer
with
questions
on
language
metre
literary
history
and
literary
criticism
then
a
paper
on
chaucer
with
questions
on
language
metre
literary
history
and
literary
criticism
lastly
a
paper
on
writing
in
the
wessex
dialect
of
old
english
with
questions
on
the
cornet
flute
harp
sackbut
language
metre
and
literary
history
now
if
you
were
to
qualify
yourself
for
all
this
as
a
scholar
should
and
in
two
years
you
would
certainly
deserve
to
be
addressed
by
mr
hamerton
as
young
man
of
letters
who
worked
excessively
and
to
work
excessively
is
not
good
for
anyone
yet
on
the
other
hand
you
are
precluded
from
using
for
your
inconveniences
the
heroic
remedy
exhibited
by
mr
hamerton
enterprising
tradesman
since
on
that
method
you
would
not
attain
to
the
main
object
of
your
laudable
ambition
a
cambridge
degree
but
the
matter
is
very
much
worse
than
your
statute
makes
it
out
take
one
of
the
papers
in
which
some
actual
acquaintance
with
literature
is
required
the
special
period
from
to
then
turn
to
your
cambridge
history
of
english
literature
and
you
will
find
that
the
mere
bibliography
of
those
years
occupies
something
like
five
or
six
hundred
pages
five
or
six
hundred
pages
of
titles
and
authors
in
simple
enumeration
the
brain
reels
it
already
suffers
inconveniences
but
stretch
the
list
back
to
chaucer
back
through
chaucer
to
those
alleged
prose
writings
in
the
wessex
dialect
then
forward
from
to
wordsworth
to
byron
to
dickens
carlyle
tennyson
browning
meredith
even
to
this
year
in
which
literature
still
lives
and
engenders
and
the
brain
if
not
too
giddy
indeed
stands
as
satan
stood
on
the
brink
of
chaos
pondering
his
voyage
for
no
narrow
frith
he
had
to
cross
and
sees
itself
with
him
now
plumbing
a
vast
vacuity
and
anon
the
crude
consistence
the
whole
business
of
reading
english
literature
in
two
years
to
it
in
any
reputable
sense
of
the
word
let
alone
your
learning
to
write
english
is
in
short
impossible
and
the
framers
of
the
statute
recognising
this
have
very
sensibly
compromised
by
setting
you
to
work
on
such
things
as
outlines
of
english
literature
which
are
not
literature
at
all
but
are
only
what
some
fellow
has
to
say
about
it
hastily
summarising
his
estimates
of
many
works
of
which
on
a
generous
computation
he
has
probably
read
and
by
examining
you
on
what
was
it
all
metre
literary
history
and
literary
criticism
which
again
are
not
literature
or
at
least
as
a
greek
would
say
in
his
idiom
escape
their
own
notice
being
literature
for
english
literature
as
i
take
it
is
which
sundry
men
and
women
have
written
memorably
in
english
about
and
so
i
come
to
my
subject
the
art
of
reading
which
is
literature
v
i
shall
take
leave
to
leap
into
it
over
another
man
back
or
rather
over
two
men
backs
no
doubt
it
has
happened
to
many
of
you
to
pick
up
in
a
happy
moment
some
book
or
pamphlet
or
copy
of
verse
which
just
says
the
word
you
have
unconsciously
been
listening
for
almost
craving
to
speak
for
yourself
and
so
sends
you
off
on
the
trail
and
if
you
have
had
that
experience
it
may
also
have
happened
to
you
that
after
ranging
you
returned
on
the
track
faithful
hound
returning
in
gratitude
or
to
refresh
the
scent
and
that
picking
up
the
book
again
you
found
it
no
such
wonderful
book
after
all
or
that
some
of
the
magic
had
faded
by
process
of
the
change
in
yourself
which
itself
had
originated
but
the
word
was
spoken
such
a
book
pamphlet
i
may
call
it
so
small
it
was
fell
into
my
hands
some
ten
years
ago
the
aims
of
literary
study
no
very
attractive
title
by
dr
corson
a
distinguished
american
professor
and
let
me
say
that
for
something
more
than
ten
say
for
twenty
years
much
of
the
most
thoughtful
as
well
as
the
most
thorough
work
upon
english
comes
to
us
from
america
i
find
as
i
handle
again
the
small
duodecimo
volume
that
my
own
thoughts
have
taken
me
a
little
wide
perhaps
a
little
astray
from
its
suggestions
but
for
loyalty
sake
i
shall
start
just
where
dr
corson
started
with
a
passage
from
browning
a
death
in
the
desert
supposed
you
will
remember
supposed
of
pamphylax
the
antiochene
narrating
the
death
of
st
john
the
evangelist
john
of
patmos
the
narrative
interrupted
by
this
gloss
this
is
the
doctrine
he
was
wont
to
teach
how
divers
persons
witness
in
each
man
three
souls
which
make
up
one
soul
to
wit
a
soul
of
each
and
all
the
bodily
parts
seated
therein
which
works
and
is
does
and
has
the
use
of
earth
and
ends
the
man
downward
but
tending
upward
for
advice
grows
into
and
again
is
grown
into
by
the
next
soul
which
seated
in
the
brain
useth
the
first
with
its
collected
use
and
feeleth
thinketh
willeth
is
which
duly
tending
upward
in
its
turn
grows
into
and
again
is
grown
into
by
the
last
soul
that
uses
both
the
first
subsisting
whether
they
assist
or
no
and
constituting
man
self
is
and
leans
upon
the
former
mark
the
word
gentlemen
upon
the
former
leaning
back
as
it
were
felt
by
him
on
this
very
man
who
had
leaned
on
christ
bosom
being
loved
and
leans
upon
the
former
makes
it
play
as
that
played
off
the
first
and
tending
up
holds
is
upheld
by
god
and
ends
the
man
upward
in
that
dread
point
of
intercourse
nor
needs
a
place
for
it
returns
to
him

what
knows
what
is
three
souls
one
man
i
give
the
glossa
of
theotypas
does
what
knows
what
there
is
no
mistaking
what
browning
means
nor
in
what
degrees
of
hierarchy
he
places
this
that
and
the
other
does
it
not
strike
you
how
curiously
men
with
their
minds
perverted
by
hate
are
inverting
that
order
all
the
highest
value
set
on
does
what
suddenly
seen
to
be
of
importance
but
only
as
important
in
feeding
the
guns
perfecting
explosives
collaring

in
the
service

or
perchance
after
all
for
no
banish
the
humanities
and
throw
everybody
into
practical
science
not
into
that
study
of
natural
science
which
can
never
conflict
with
the
since
it
seeks
discovery

the
pure
sake
of
truth
or
charitably
to
alleviate
man
lot
sweetly
rather
to
ease
loose
and
bind
as
need
requires
this
frail
fallen
humankind
but
to
invent
what
will
be
commercially
serviceable
in
besting
your
neighbour
or
in
gassing
him
or
in
slaughtering
him
neatly
and
wholesale
but
still
the
whisper
not
ridiculous
in
its
day
will
assert
itself
that
comes
first
holding
and
upheld
by
god
still
through
the
market
clamour
for
a
government
will
persist
the
voice
of
plato
murmuring
that
after
all
the
best
form
of
government
is
government
by
good
men
and
the
voice
of
some
small
man
faintly
protesting
i
do
want
to
be
governed
by
business
men
because
i
know
them
and
without
asking
much
of
life
i
have
a
hankering
to
die
with
a
shirt
on
my
back
vi
but
let
us
postpone
for
a
moment
and
deal
with
and
they
too
of
course
have
had
their
oppositions
and
the
very
meaning
of
a
university
such
as
cambridge
its
its
its
greek
to
ti
en
einai
was
to
assert
against
in
a
medieval
world
pranced
over
by
normans
english
burgundians
scots
ancillary
to
theology
which
then
had
a
meaning
vastly
different
from
its
meaning
the
university
tended
as
portress
of
the
gate
of
knowledge
of
such
knowledge
as
the
church
required
encouraged
or
permitted
and
kept
the
flag
of
intellectual
life
as
i
may
put
it
flying
above
that
gate
and
over
the
passing
throngs
of
and
the
university
was
a
seat
of
learning
the
colleges
as
they
sprang
up
were
houses
of
learning
but
note
this
which
in
their
origin
and
still
in
the
frame
of
their
constitution
differentiates
oxford
and
cambridge
from
all
their
ancient
sisters
and
rivals
these
two
and
no
third
i
believe
in
europe
were
corporations
of
teachers
existing
for
teachers
governed
by
teachers
in
a
scottish
university
the
students
by
vote
choose
their
rector
but
here
or
at
oxford
no
undergraduate
no
bachelor
counts
at
all
in
the
government
both
remaining
alike
statu
until
qualified
as
masters
mark
the
word
and
mark
also
the
title
of
one
who
obtained
what
in
those
days
would
be
the
highest
of
degrees
but
yet
gave
him
no
voting
strength
above
a
master
he
was
a
theologiae
professor
to
this
day
every
country
clergyman
who
comes
up
to
cambridge
to
record
his
does
so
by
virtue
of
his
capacity
to
teach
what
he
learned
here
in
theory
that
is
scholars
were
included
in
college
foundations
on
a
sort
of
system
living
in
rooms
with
the
lordly
masters
and
valeting
them
for
the
privilege
of
with
them
we
keep
to
this
day
the
pleasant
old
form
of
words
now
for
various
reasons
one
of
which
because
it
is
closely
germane
to
my
subject
i
shall
particularly
examine
oxford
and
cambridge
while
conserving
almost
intact
their
medieval
frame
of
government
with
a
hundred
other
survivals
which
time
but
makes
through
endurance
more
endearing
have
insensibly
as
it
were
and
across
it
must
be
confessed
intervals
of
sloth
and
gross
dereliction
of
duty
added
a
new
function
to
the
cultivation
of
learning
that
of
furnishing
out
of
youth
a
succession
of
men
capable
of
fulfilling
high
offices
in
church
and
state
some
may
regret
this
i
think
many
of
us
must
regret
that
a
deeper
tincture
of
learning
is
not
required
of
the
average
or
injected
into
him
perforce
but
speaking
roughly
about
fact
i
should
say
that
while
we
elders
up
here
are
required
nay
presumed
to
certain
things
we
aim
that
our
young
men
shall
be
of
a
certain
kind
and
i
see
no
cause
to
disown
a
sentence
in
the
very
first
lecture
i
had
the
honour
of
reading
before
you
man
we
are
proud
to
send
forth
from
our
schools
will
be
remarkable
less
for
something
he
can
take
out
of
his
wallet
and
exhibit
for
knowledge
than
for
something
and
that
something
recognisable
for
a
man
of
unmistakable
intellectual
breeding
whose
trained
judgment
we
can
trust
to
choose
the
better
and
reject
the
worse
the
reasons
which
have
led
our
older
universities
to
deflect
their
functions
whether
for
good
or
ill
so
far
from
their
first
purpose
are
complicated
if
not
many
once
admit
young
men
in
large
numbers
and
youth
i
call
any
dean
or
tutor
to
witness
must
be
compromised
with
will
construe
the
laws
of
its
seniors
in
its
own
way
now
and
then
breaking
them
and
will
inevitably
end
by
getting
something
of
its
own
the
growth
of
gymnastic
the
insensible
gravitation
of
the
elderly
towards
fenner
there
to
snatch
a
fearful
joy
and
explain
that
the
walk
was
good
for
them
the
union
and
other
debating
societies
college
rivalries
the
festivities
of
may
week
the
invasion
of
women
students
all
these
may
have
helped
but
i
must
dwell
discreetly
on
one
compelling
and
obvious
cause
the
increased
and
increasing
unwieldiness
of
knowledge
and
that
is
the
main
trouble
as
i
guess
vii
let
us
look
it
fair
in
the
face
because
it
is
the
main
practical
difficulty
with
which
i
propose
that
in
succeeding
lectures
we
grapple
against
knowledge
i
have
as
the
light
cynic
observed
of
a
certain
lady
past
only
one
serious
objection
that
there
is
so
much
of
it
there
is
indeed
so
much
of
it
that
if
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
you
devoted
yourself
to
it
as
a
mere
scholar
you
could
not
possibly
digest
its
accumulated
and
still
accumulating
stores
as
sir
thomas
elyot
wrote
in
the
century
using
you
will
observe
the
very
word
of
mr
energetic
but
tradesman
always
doe
happen
by
ingurgitation
and
excessive
feedings
an
old
schoolmaster
and
a
poet
mr
james
rhoades
late
of
sherborne
comments
in
words
which
i
will
quote
being
unable
to
better
them
this
is
no
less
true
of
the
mind
than
of
the
body
i
do
not
know
that
a
man
as
such
is
more
worthy
of
regard
than
a
one
the
brain
indeed
is
a
nobler
organ
than
the
stomach
but
on
that
very
account
is
the
less
to
be
excused
for
indulging
in
repletion
the
temptation
i
confess
is
greater
because
for
the
brain
the
banquet
stands
ever
spread
before
our
eyes
and
is
unhappily
as
indestructible
as
the
widow
meal
and
oil
only
think
what
would
become
of
us
if
the
physical
food
by
which
our
bodies
subsist
instead
of
being
consumed
by
the
eater
was
passed
on
intact
by
every
generation
to
the
next
with
the
superadded
hoards
of
all
the
ages
the
productive
power
meanwhile
increasing
year
by
year
beneath
the
unflagging
hand
of
science
till
as
comus
says
she
would
be
quite
surcharged
with
her
own
weight
and
strangled
with
her
waste
fertility
should
we
rather
not
pull
down
our
barns
and
build
smaller
and
make
bonfires
of
what
they
would
not
hold
and
yet
with
regard
to
knowledge
the
very
opposite
of
this
is
what
we
do
we
store
the
whole
religiously
and
that
though
not
twice
alone
as
with
the
bees
in
virgil
but
scores
of
times
in
every
year
is
the
teeming
produce
gathered
in
and
then
we
put
a
fearful
pressure
on
ourselves
and
others
to
gorge
of
it
as
much
as
ever
we
can
hold
indignatio
my
author
gathering
heat
puts
it
somewhat
dithyrambically
but
there
you
have
it
gentlemen
if
you
crave
for
knowledge
the
banquet
of
knowledge
grows
and
groans
on
the
board
until
the
finer
appetite
sickens
if
still
putting
all
your
trust
in
knowledge
you
try
to
dodge
the
difficulty
by
specialising
you
produce
a
brain
bulging
out
inordinately
on
one
side
on
the
other
cut
flat
down
and
mostly
paralytic
at
that
and
in
short
so
long
as
i
hold
that
the
creator
has
an
idea
of
a
man
so
long
shall
i
be
sure
that
no
uneven
specialist
realises
it
the
real
tragedy
of
the
library
at
alexandria
was
not
that
the
incendiaries
burned
immensely
but
that
they
had
neither
the
leisure
nor
the
taste
to
discriminate
viii
the
old
schoolmaster
whom
i
quoted
just
now
goes
on
i
believe
if
the
truth
were
known
men
would
be
astonished
at
the
small
amount
of
learning
with
which
a
high
degree
of
culture
is
compatible
in
a
moment
of
enthusiasm
i
ventured
once
to
tell
my
set
that
if
they
could
really
master
the
ninth
book
of
paradise
lost
so
as
to
rise
to
the
height
of
its
great
argument
and
incorporate
all
its
beauties
in
themselves
they
would
at
one
blow
by
virtue
of
that
alone
become
highly
cultivated
men
more
and
more
various
learning
might
raise
them
to
the
same
height
by
different
paths
but
could
hardly
raise
them
higher
here
let
me
interpose
and
quote
the
last
three
lines
of
that
book
three
lines
only
simple
unornamented
but
for
every
man
and
every
woman
who
have
dwelt
together
since
our
first
parents
in
mere
statement
how
wise
thus
they
in
mutual
accusation
spent
the
fruitless
hours
neither
and
of
their
vain
contest
appear
no
end
a
parent
afterwards
told
me
my
schoolmaster
adds
that
his
son
went
home
and
so
buried
himself
in
the
book
that
food
and
sleep
that
day
had
no
attraction
for
him
next
morning
i
need
hardly
say
the
difference
in
his
appearance
was
remarkable
he
had
outgrown
all
his
intellectual
clothes
the
end
of
this
story
strikes
me
i
confess
as
rapid
and
may
be
compared
with
that
of
the
growth
of
delian
apollo
in
the
homeric
hymn
but
we
may
agree
that
in
reading
it
is
not
quantity
so
much
that
tells
as
quality
and
thoroughness
of
digestion
ix
does
what
knows
what
is
i
am
not
likely
to
depreciate
to
you
the
value
of
does
after
spending
my
first
twelve
lectures
up
here
on
the
art
and
practice
of
writing
encouraging
you
to
this
thing
which
i
daily
delight
in
trying
to
do
as
god
forbid
that
anyone
should
hint
a
slightening
word
of
what
our
sons
and
brothers
are
doing
just
now
and
doing
for
us
but
peace
being
the
normal
condition
of
man
activity
i
look
around
me
for
a
vindication
of
what
is
noblest
in
and
am
content
with
a
passage
from
george
eliot
poem
stradivarius
the
gist
of
which
is
that
god
himself
might
conceivably
make
better
fiddles
than
stradivari
but
by
no
means
certainly
since
as
a
fact
god
orders
his
best
fiddles
of
stradivari
says
the
great
workman
be
praised
antonio
stradivari
has
an
eye
that
winces
at
false
work
and
loves
the
true
with
hand
and
arm
that
play
upon
the
tool
as
willingly
as
any
singing
bird
sets
him
to
sing
his
morning
roundelay
because
he
likes
to
sing
and
likes
the
song
then
naldo
a
pretty
kind
of
fame
at
best
that
comes
of
making
violins
and
saves
no
masses
either
thou
wilt
go
to
purgatory
none
the
less
but
he
purgatory
here
to
make
them
ill
and
for
my
fame
when
any
master
holds
chin
and
hand
a
violin
of
mine
he
will
be
glad
that
stradivari
lived
made
violins
and
made
them
of
the
best
the
masters
only
know
whose
work
is
good
they
will
choose
mine
and
while
god
gives
them
skill
i
give
them
instruments
to
play
upon
god
choosing
me
to
help
him
were
god
at
fault
for
violins
thou
absent
he
were
at
fault
for
stradivari
work
many
hold
violins
as
good
as
thine
be
they
are
different
his
quality
declines
he
spoils
his
hand
with
but
were
his
the
best
he
could
not
work
for
two
my
work
is
mine
and
heresy
or
not
if
my
hand
slacked
i
should
rob
god
since
he
is
fullest
good
leaving
a
blank
instead
of
violins
i
say
not
god
himself
can
make
man
best
without
best
men
to
help
him
is
god
gives
skill
but
not
without
men
hands
he
could
not
make
antonio
stradivari
violins
without
antonio
get
thee
to
thy
easel
so
much
then
for
i
do
not
depreciate
it
x
neither
do
i
depreciate
in
cambridge
save
the
mark
all
knowledge
is
venerable
and
i
suppose
you
will
find
the
last
vindication
of
the
scholar
life
at
its
baldest
in
browning
a
grammarian
funeral

say

and
indeed
as
a
matter
of
experience
can
not

be
counted
upon
to

of

of
extreme
learning

of

uncouth

overbearing

men
of
whom

sophist
thrasymachus
in
plato
republic
may
stand
for
the
general
type
nay
some
of
us
will
subscribe
with
the
old
schoolmaster
whom
i
will
quote
again
when
he
writes
to
myself
personally
as
an
exception
to
the
rule
that
opposites
attract
a
very
person
is
an
object
of
terror
his
mind
seems
to
be
so
full
of
facts
that
you
can
not
as
it
were
see
the
wood
for
the
trees
there
is
no
room
for
perspective
no
lawns
and
glades
for
pleasure
and
repose
no
vistas
through
which
to
view
some
towering
hill
or
elevated
temple
everything
in
that
crowded
space
seems
of
the
same
value
he
speaks
with
no
more
awe
of
king
lear
than
of
the
last
cobden
prize
essay
he
has
swallowed
them
both
with
the
same
ease
and
got
the
facts
safe
in
his
pouch
but
he
has
no
time
to
ruminate
because
he
must
still
be
swallowing
nor
does
he
seem
to
know
what
even
macbeth
with
banquo
murderers
then
at
work
found
leisure
to
remember
that
good
digestion
must
wait
on
appetite
if
health
is
to
follow
both
now
that
may
be
put
a
trifle
too
vivaciously
but
the
moral
is
true
bacon
tells
us
that
reading
maketh
a
full
man
yes
and
too
much
of
it
makes
him
too
full
the
two
words
of
the
greek
upon
knowledge
remain
true
that
the
last
triumph
of
knowledge
is
so
don
quixote
repeats
it
to
sancho
panza
counselling
him
how
to
govern
his
island
first
o
son
thou
hast
to
fear
god
for
in
fearing
him
is
wisdom
and
being
wise
thou
canst
not
err
but
secondly
thou
hast
to
set
thine
eyes
on
what
thou
art
endeavouring
to
thyself
which
is
the
most
that
can
be
but
to
know
oneself
is
to
know
that
which
alone
can
know
so
the
hierarchy
runs
up
xi
does
what
knows
what
is
i
have
happily
left
myself
no
time
to
speak
of
happily
because
i
would
not
have
you
even
approach
it
towards
the
end
of
an
hour
when
your
attention
must
be
languishing
but
i
leave
you
with
two
promises
and
with
two
sayings
from
which
as
this
lecture
took
its
start
its
successors
will
proceed
the
first
promise
is
that
is
being
the
spiritual
element
in
man
is
the
highest
object
of
his
study
the
second
promise
is
that
of
what
is
worthy
to
be
called
literature
being
concerned
with
this
spiritual
element
for
that
it
should
be
studied
from
firstly
up
to
ninthly
before
anything
else
and
my
two
quotations
are
for
you
to
ponder
this
first
that
all
spirit
is
mutually
attractive
as
all
matter
is
mutually
attractive
is
an
ultimate
fact
beyond
which
we
can
not
go
spirit
to
spirit
as
in
water
face
answereth
to
face
so
the
heart
of
man
to
man
and
this
other
from
the
writings
of
an
obscure
welsh
clergyman
of
the
century
you
will
never
enjoy
the
world
aright
till
the

itself
floweth

you

footnote
the
reader
will
kindly
turn
back
to
and
observe
the
date
at
the
head
of
this
lecture
at
that
time
i
was
engaged
against
a
system
of
english
teaching
which
i
believed
to
be
thoroughly
bad
that
system
has
since
given
place
to
another
which
i
am
prepared
to
defend
as
a
better
lecture
ii
apprehension
versus
comprehension
wednesday
november
i
let
us
attempt
gentlemen
picking
up
the
scent
where
we
left
at
the
conclusion
of
my
first
lecture
to
hunt
the
art
of
reading
as
i
shall
call
it
a
little
further
on
the
line
of
then
to
cast
back
and
chase
on
a
line
somewhat
more
philosophical
if
these
lines
run
wide
and
refuse
to
unite
we
shall
have
made
a
false
cast
if
they
converge
and
meet
we
shall
have
caught
our
hare
and
may
proceed
in
subsequent
lectures
to
cook
him
well
the
line
of
has
brought
us
to
this
point
that
man
and
this
planet
being
such
as
they
are
for
a
man
to
read
all
the
books
existent
on
it
is
impossible
and
if
possible
would
be
in
the
highest
degree
undesirable
let
us
for
example
go
back
quite
beyond
the
invention
of
printing
and
try
to
imagine
a
man
who
had
read
all
the
rolls
destroyed
in
the
library
of
alexandria
by
successive
burnings
some
reckon
the
number
of
these
mss
at
suppose
further
this
man
to
be
gifted
with
a
memory
retentive
as
lord
macaulay
suppose
lastly
that
we
go
to
such
a
man
and
beg
him
to
repeat
to
us
some
chosen
one
of
the
fifty
or
seventy
lost
or
partially
lost
plays
of
euripides
it
is
incredible
that
he
could
gratify
us
there
was
as
i
have
said
a
great
burning
at
alexandria
in
when
caesar
set
the
fleet
in
the
harbour
on
fire
to
prevent
its
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
egyptians
the
flames
spread
and
the
great
library
stood
but
yards
from
the
quayside
with
warehouses
full
of
books
yet
closer
the
last
great
burning
was
perpetrated
in
gibbon
quotes
the
famous
sentence
of
omar
the
great
mohammedan
who
gave
the
order
these
writings
of
the
greeks
agree
with
the
book
of
god
they
are
useless
and
need
not
be
preserved
if
they
disagree
they
are
pernicious
and
ought
to
be
destroyed
and
goes
on
the
sentence
was
executed
with
blind
obedience
the
volumes
of
paper
or
parchment
were
distributed
to
the
four
thousand
baths
of
the
city
and
such
was
their
incredible
multitude
that
six
months
were
barely
sufficient
for
the
consumption
of
this
precious
fuel
the
tale
has
been
repeatedly
transcribed
and
every
scholar
with
pious
indignation
has
deplored
the
irreparable
shipwreck
of
the
learning
the
arts
and
the
genius
of
antiquity
for
my
own
part
i
am
strongly
tempted
to
deny
both
the
fact
and
the
consequences
of
the
consequence
he
writes
perhaps
the
church
and
seat
of
the
patriarchs
might
be
enriched
with
a
repository
of
books
but
if
the
ponderous
mass
of
arian
and
monophysite
controversy
were
indeed
consumed
in
the
public
baths
a
philosopher
may
allow
with
a
smile
that
it
was
ultimately
devoted
to
the
benefit
of
mankind
i
sincerely
regret
the
more
valuable
libraries
which
have
been
involved
in
the
ruin
of
the
roman
empire
but
when
i
seriously
compute
the
lapse
of
ages
the
waste
of
ignorance
and
the
calamities
of
war
our
treasures
rather
than
our
losses
are
the
object
of
my
surprise
many
curious
and
interesting
facts
are
buried
in
oblivion
the
three
great
historians
of
rome
have
been
transmitted
to
our
hands
in
a
mutilated
state
and
we
are
deprived
of
many
pleasing
compositions
of
the
lyric
iambic
and
dramatic
poetry
of
the
greeks
yet
we
should
gratefully
remember
that
the
mischances
of
time
and
accident
have
spared
the
classic
works
to
which
the
suffrage
of
antiquity
had
adjudged
the
first
place
of
genius
and
glory
the
teachers
of
ancient
knowledge
who
are
still
extant
had
perused
and
compared
the
writings
of
their
predecessors
nor
can
it
fairly
be
presumed
that
any
important
truth
any
useful
discovery
in
art
or
nature
has
been
snatched
away
from
the
curiosity
of
modern
ages
i
certainly
do
not
ask
you
to
subscribe
to
all
that
in
fact
when
gibbon
asks
us
to
remember
gratefully
the
mischances
of
time
and
accident
have
spared
the
classic
works
to
which
the
suffrage
of
antiquity
had
adjudged
the
first
place
of
genius
and
glory
i
submit
with
all
respect
that
he
talks
nonsense
like
the
stranger
in
the
temple
of
the
invited
to
admire
the
many
votive
garments
of
those
preserved
out
of
shipwreck
i
ask
ubi
sunt
vestimenta
eorum
qui
post
vota
nuncupata
perierunt
or
in
other
words
are
the
trousers
of
the
drowned
about
the
sthenoboea
of
euripides
the
revellers
of
ameipsias
to
which
as
a
matter
of
simple
fact
what
you
call
the
suffrage
of
antiquity
did
adjudge
the
first
prize
above
aristophanes
best
but
of
course
he
is
equally
right
to
this
extent
that
the
fire
consumed
a
vast
deal
of
rubbish
solid
tons
more
than
any
man
could
swallow
let
be
digest
mark
learn
and
inwardly
digest
and
that
was
in
whereas
we
have
arrived
at
where
would
our
voracious
alexandrian
be
with
all
the
literature
of
the
middle
ages
added
to
his
feast
and
on
top
of
that
all
the
printed
books
of
years
says
bacon
a
full
man
yes
indeed
now
i
am
glad
that
sentence
of
bacon
falls
pat
here
because
it
gives
me
turning
to
his
famous
essay
of
studies
the
reinforcement
of
his
great
name
for
the
very
argument
which
i
am
directing
against
the
fallacy
of
those
teachers
who
would
have
you
use
as
anything
else
than
guides
to
your
own
reading
or
perspectives
in
which
the
authors
are
set
out
in
the
comparative
eminence
by
which
they
claim
priority
of
study
or
indicate
the
proportions
of
a
literary
period
some
of
these
manuals
are
written
by
men
of
knowledge
so
encyclopaedic
that
if
it
go
with
critical
judgment
for
these
purposes
they
may
be
trusted
but
to
require
you
at
your
stage
of
reading
to
have
even
the
minor
names
by
heart
is
a
perversity
of
folly
for
later
studies
it
seems
to
me
a
more
pardonable
mistake
but
yet
a
mistake
to
hope
that
by
the
employ
of
separate
specialists
you
can
get
even
in
or
volumes
a
perspective
a
proportionate
description
of
what
english
literature
really
is
but
worst
of
all
is
that
examiner
who
aware
that
you
must
please
him
to
get
a
good
degree
and
being
just
as
straight
and
industrious
as
anyone
else
assumes
that
in
two
years
you
have
become
expert
in
knowledge
that
beats
a
lifetime
and
brought
up
against
the
practical
impossibility
of
this
assumption
questions
you
not
on
a
little
selected
knowledge
but
on
massed
information
which
at
the
best
can
be
but
derivative
and
now
hear
bacon
studies
serve
for
delight
mark
it
he
puts
delight
first
studies
serve
for
delight
for
ornament
and
for
ability
their
chiefe
use
for
delight
is
in
privatenesse
and
retiring
for
ornament
is
in
discourse
and
for
ability
is
in
the
judgement
and
disposition
of
businesse
to
spend
too
much
time
in
studies
is
sloth
to
use
them
too
much
for
ornament
is
affectation
to
make
judgement
wholly
by
their
rules
is
the
humour
of
a
scholler
they
perfect
nature
and
are
perfected
by
experience
for
naturall
abilities
are
like
naturall
plants
they
need
proyning
by
study
and
studies
themselves
doe
give
forth
directions
too
much
at
large
unless
they
be
bounded
in
by
experience
again
he
says
some
bookes
are
to
be
tasted
others
to
be
swallowed
and
some
few
to
be
chewed
and
digested
that
is
some
bookes
are
to
be
read
onely
in
parts
others
to
be
read
but
not
curiously
and
some
few
are
to
be
read
wholly
and
with
diligence
and
attention
some
bookes
also
may
be
read
by
deputy
and
extracts
made
of
them
by
others
but
that
would
be
onely
in
the
lesse
important
arguments
and
the
meaner
sort
of
bookes
else
distilled
bookes
are
like
common
distilled
waters
flashy
things
so
you
see
gentlemen
while
pleading
before
you
that
reading
is
an
art
that
its
best
purpose
is
not
to
accumulate
knowledge
but
to
produce
to
educate
a
man
that
is
a
folly
to
bite
off
more
than
you
can
assimilate
and
that
with
it
as
with
every
other
art
the
difficulty
and
the
discipline
lie
in
selecting
out
of
vast
material
what
is
fit
fine
applicable
i
have
the
great
francis
bacon
himself
towering
behind
my
shoulder
for
patron
some
would
push
the
argument
further
than
here
and
now
at
any
rate
i
choose
to
do
or
perhaps
would
at
all
care
to
do
for
example
philip
gilbert
hamerton
whom
i
quoted
to
you
three
weeks
ago
instances
in
his
book
the
intellectual
life
an
accomplished
french
cook
who
in
discussing
his
art
comprised
the
whole
secret
of
it
under
two
heads
the
knowledge
of
the
mutual
influences
of
ingredients
and
the
judicious
management
of
heat
amongst
the
dishes
for
which
my
friend
had
a
deserved
reputation
was
a
certain
de
which
had
a
very
exquisite
flavour
the
principal
ingredient
not
in
quantity
but
in
power
was
the
liver
of
a
fowl
but
there
were
several
other
ingredients
also
and
amongst
these
a
leaf
or
two
of
parsley
he
told
me
that
the
influence
of
the
parsley
was
a
good
illustration
of
his
theory
about
his
art
if
the
parsley
were
omitted
the
flavour
he
aimed
at
was
not
produced
at
all
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
quantity
of
the
parsley
was
in
the
least
excessive
then
the
instead
of
being
a
delicacy
for
gourmets
became
an
uneatable
mess
perceiving
that
i
was
really
interested
in
the
subject
he
kindly
promised
a
practical
evidence
of
his
doctrine
and
the
next
day
intentionally
spoiled
the
dish
by
a
trifling
addition
of
parsley
he
had
not
exaggerated
the
consequences
the
delicate
flavour
entirely
departed
and
left
a
nauseous
bitterness
in
its
place
like
the
remembrance
of
an
youth
i
trust
that
none
of
you
are
in
a
position
to
appreciate
the
full
force
of
this
last
simile
and
for
myself
i
should
have
taken
the
chef
word
for
it
without
experiment
mr
hamerton
proceeds
to
draw
his
moral
there
is
a
sort
of
intellectual
chemistry
which
is
quite
as
marvellous
as
material
chemistry
and
a
thousand
times
more
difficult
to
observe
one
general
truth
may
however
be
relied
upon
it
is
true
that
everything
we
learn
affects
the
character
of
the
mind
consider
how
incalculably
important
becomes
the
question
of
in
our
knowledge
and
how
that
which
we
are
is
dependent
as
much
upon
our
ignorance
as
our
science
what
we
call
ignorance
is
only
a
smaller
proportion
what
we
call
science
only
a
larger
here
the
argument
begins
to
become
delicious
the
larger
quantity
is
recommended
as
an
unquestionable
good
but
the
goodness
of
it
is
entirely
dependent
the
mental
product
that
we
aristocracies
have
always
instinctively
felt
this
and
have
decided
that
a
gentleman
ought
not
to
know
too
much
of
certain
arts
and
sciences
the
character
which
they
had
accepted
as
their
ideal
would
have
been
destroyed
by
indiscriminate
additions
to
those
ingredients
of
which
long
experience
had
fixed
the
exact
proportions
the
last
generation
of
the
english
country
aristocracy
was
particularly
rich
in
characters
whose
unity
and
charm
was
dependent
upon
the
limitations
of
their
culture
and
which
would
have
been
entirely
altered
perhaps
not
for
the
better
by
simply
knowing
a
science
or
a
literature
that
was
dosed
to
them
if
anything
could
be
funnier
than
that
it
is
that
it
is
very
possibly
true
let
us
end
our
for
the
moment
on
this
that
to
read
all
the
books
that
have
been
written
short
to
keep
pace
with
those
that
are
being
written
is
starkly
impossible
and
as
aristotle
would
say
about
what
is
impossible
one
does
not
argue
we
select
selection
implies
skilful
practice
skilful
practice
is
only
another
term
for
art
so
far
plain
leads
us
on
this
point
then
let
us
set
up
a
rest
and
hark
back
ii
let
us
cast
back
to
the
three
terms
of
my
first
lecture
does
what
knows
what
i
shall
here
take
leave
to
recapitulate
a
brief
argument
much
sneered
at
a
few
years
ago
when
it
was
still
fashionable
to
consider
hegel
a
greater
philosopher
than
plato
abbreviating
it
i
repeat
it
because
i
believe
in
it
yet
when
hegel
for
causes
unconnected
with
pure
right
and
wrong
has
gone
somewhat
out
of
fashion
for
a
while
as
the
tale
then
is
told
by
plato
in
the
tenth
book
of
the
republic
one
er
the
son
of
armenius
a
pamphylian
was
slain
in
battle
and
ten
days
afterwards
when
they
collected
the
dead
for
burial
his
body
alone
showed
no
taint
of
corruption
his
relatives
however
bore
it
off
to
the
funeral
pyre
and
on
the
twelfth
day
lying
there
he
returned
to
life
and
he
told
them
what
he
had
seen
in
the
other
world
many
wonders
he
related
concerning
the
dead
for
example
with
their
rewards
and
punishments
but
what
had
impressed
him
as
most
wonderful
of
all
was
the
great
spindle
of
necessity
reaching
up
to
heaven
with
the
planets
revolving
around
it
in
graduated
whorls
of
width
and
spread
yet
all
concentric
and
so
timed
that
all
complete
the
full
circle
punctually
together
spindle
turns
on
the
knees
of
necessity
and
on
the
rim
of
each
whorl
sits
perched
a
siren
who
goes
round
with
it
hymning
a
single
note
the
eight
notes
together
forming
one
harmony
now
as
we
have
the
divine
word
for
it
upon
two
great
commandments
hang
all
the
law
and
the
prophets
so
all
religions
all
philosophies
hang
upon
two
steadfast
and
faithful
beliefs
the
first
of
which
plato
would
show
by
the
above
parable
it
is
of
course
that
the
stability
of
the
universe
rests
upon
ordered
motion
that
the
above
around
beneath
stands
firm
continues
firm
on
a
balance
of
active
and
tremendous
forces
somehow
harmoniously
composed
theology
asks
what
or
whom
philosophy
inclines
rather
to
ask
natural
science
allowing
that
for
the
present
these
questions
are
probably
unanswerable
contents
itself
with
mapping
and
measuring
what
it
can
of
the
various
forces
but
all
agree
about
the
harmony
and
when
a
galileo
or
a
newton
discovers
a
single
rule
of
it
for
us
he
but
makes
our
assurance
surer
for
uncounted
centuries
before
ever
hearing
of
gravitation
men
knew
of
the
sun
that
he
rose
and
set
of
the
moon
that
she
waxed
and
waned
of
the
tides
that
they
flowed
and
ebbed
all
regularly
at
times
to
be
predicted
of
the
stars
that
they
swung
as
by
clockwork
around
the
pole
says
the
son
of
sirach
at
the
word
of
the
holy
one
they
will
stand
in
due
order
and
they
will
not
faint
in
their
watches
so
evident
is
this
calculated
harmony
that
men
seeking
to
interpret
it
by
what
was
most
harmonious
in
themselves
or
in
their
human
experience
supposed
an
actual
music
of
the
spheres
inaudible
to
mortals
plato
as
we
see
who
learned
of
pythagoras
inventing
his
octave
of
sirens
perched
on
the
whorls
of
the
great
spindle
and
intoning
as
they
spin
dante
chaucer
copying
him
in
the
parlement
of
fowls
makes
the
spheres
nine
and
so
does
milton
then
listen
i
to
the
celestial
harmony
that
sit
upon
the
nine
infolded
sphears
and
sing
to
those
that
hold
the
vital
shears
and
turn
the
adamantine
spindle
round
on
which
the
fate
of
gods
and
men
is
wound
such
sweet
compulsion
doth
in
musick
lie
to
lull
the
daughters
of
and
keep
unsteady
nature
to
her
law
and
the
low
world
in
measur
motion
draw
after
the
heavenly
tune
if
the
sceptical
mind
object
to
the
word
as
begging
the
question
and
postulating
a
governing
intelligence
with
a
governing
will
if
it
tell
me
that
when
revolted
lucifer
uprose
in
starlight
and
at
the
stars
which
are
the
brain
of
heaven
he
look
and
sank
around
the
ancient
track
march
rank
on
rank
the
army
of
unalterable
law
he
was
merely
witnessing
a
series
of
predictable
or
invariable
recurrences
i
answer
that
he
may
be
right
it
suffices
for
my
argument
that
they
recurrent
are
invariable
can
be
predicted
anyhow
the
universe
is
not
chaos
if
it
were
by
the
way
we
should
be
unable
to
reason
about
it
at
all
it
stands
and
is
renewed
upon
a
harmony
and
what
plato
called
is
the
duty
compulsory
or
free
as
you
or
i
can
conceive
it
the
duty
of
all
created
things
to
obey
that
harmony
the
duty
of
which
wordsworth
tells
in
his
noble
ode
thou
dost
preserve
the
stars
from
wrong
and
the
most
ancient
heavens
through
thee
are
fresh
and
strong
iii
now
the
other
and
second
great
belief
is
that
the
universe
the
macrocosm
can
not
be
apprehended
at
all
except
as
its
rays
converge
upon
the
eye
brain
soul
of
man
the
microcosm
on
you
on
me
on
the
tiny
percipient
centre
upon
which
the
immense
cosmic
circle
focuses
itself
as
the
sun
upon
a
and
he
is
not
shrivelled
up
other
creatures
he
notes
share
in
his
sensations
but
so
far
as
he
can
discover
not
in
his
percipience
or
not
in
any
degree
worth
measuring
so
far
as
he
can
discover
he
is
not
only
a
bewildered
actor
in
the
great
pageant
but
ring
enclosing
all
the
sole
intelligent
spectator
wonder
of
wonders
it
is
all
meant
for
i
doubt
if
among
men
of
our
nation
this
truth
was
ever
more
clearly
grasped
than
by
the
cambridge
platonists
who
taught
your
forerunners
of
the
century
but
i
will
quote
you
here
two
short
passages
from
the
work
of
a
sort
of
poor
relation
of
theirs
a
humble
welsh
parson
of
that
time
thomas
traherne
unknown
until
the
day
before
yesterday
from
whom
i
gave
you
one
sentence
in
my
first
lecture
he
is
speaking
of
the
fields
and
streets
that
were
the
scene
of
his
childhood
those
pure
and
virgin
apprehensions
i
had
from
the
womb
and
that
divine
light
wherewith
i
was
born
are
the
best
unto
this
day
wherein
i
can
see
the
universe
the
corn
was
orient
and
immortal
wheat
which
never
should
be
reaped
nor
was
ever
sown
i
thought
it
had
stood
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
the
dust
and
stones
of
the
street
were
as
precious
as
gold
the
gates
were
at
first
the
end
of
the
world
the
green
trees
when
i
saw
them
first
through
one
of
the
gates
transported
and
ravished
me
boys
and
girls
tumbling
in
the
street
and
playing
were
moving
jewels
i
knew
not
that
they
were
born
or
should
die
the
streets
were
mine
the
temple
was
mine
the
people
were
mine
their
clothes
and
gold
and
silver
were
mine
as
much
as
their
sparkling
eyes
fair
skins
and
ruddy
faces
the
skies
were
mine
and
so
were
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
all
the
world
was
mine
and
i
the
only
spectator
and
enjoyer
of
it
then
news
from
a
foreign
country
came
as
if
my
treasure
and
my
wealth
lay
there
so
much
it
did
my
heart
inflame
was
wont
to
call
my
soul
into
mine
ear
which
thither
went
to
meet
the
approaching
sweet
and
on
the
threshold
stood
to
entertain
the
unknown
good
what
sacred
instinct
did
inspire
my
soul
in
childhood
with
a
hope
to
strong
what
secret
force
moved
my
desire
to
expect
new
joys
beyond
the
seas
so
young
felicity
i
knew
was
out
of
view
and
being
here
alone
i
saw
that
happiness
was
gone
from
me
for
this
i
thirsted
absent
bliss
and
thought
that
sure
beyond
the
seas
or
else
in
something
near
at
hand
i
knew
not
yet
since
naught
did
please
i
knew
my
bliss
did
stand
but
little
did
the
infant
dream
that
all
the
treasures
of
the
world
were
by
and
that
himself
was
so
the
cream
and
crown
of
all
which
round
about
did
lie
yet
thus
it
was
the
gem
the
diadem
the
ring
enclosing
all
that
stood
upon
this
earthly
ball
the
heavenly
eye
much
wider
than
the
sky
wherein
they
all
included
were
the
glorious
soul
that
was
the
king
made
to
possess
them
did
appear
a
small
and
little
thing
and
then
comes
the
noble
sentence
of
which
i
promised
you
that
it
should
fall
into
its
place
you
never
enjoy
the
world
aright
till
the
sea
itself
floweth
in
your
veins
till
you
are
clothed
with
the
heavens
and
crowned
with
the
stars
man
in
short
you
i
any
one
of
us
the
heir
of
it
all
circa
unum
caput
tumultuantes
deos
our
best
privilege
to
sing
our
short
lives
out
in
tune
with
the
heavenly
concert
and
if
to
sing
afterwards
then
afterwards
iv
but
how
shall
man
ever
attain
to
understand
and
find
his
proper
place
in
this
universe
this
great
sweeping
harmonious
circle
of
which
nevertheless
he
feels
himself
to
be
the
diminutive
focus
his
senses
are
absurdly
imperfect
his
ear
can
not
catch
any
music
the
spheres
make
and
moreover
there
are
probably
neither
spheres
nor
music
his
eye
is
so
dull
an
instrument
that
as
blanco
white
famous
sonnet
reminds
us
he
can
neither
see
this
world
in
the
dark
nor
glimpse
any
of
the
scores
of
others
until
it
falls
dark
if
light
can
thus
deceive
wherefore
not
life
yet
the
universal
harmony
is
meaningless
and
nothing
to
man
save
in
so
far
as
apprehends
it
and
lacking
him
so
far
as
he
knows
it
utterly
lacks
the
compliment
of
an
audience
is
all
the
great
orchestra
designed
for
nothing
but
to
please
its
conductor
yes
if
you
choose
but
no
as
i
think
and
here
my
other
quotation
that
all
spirit
is
mutually
attractive
as
all
matter
is
mutually
attractive
is
an
ultimate
fact
spirit
to
spirit
as
in
water
face
answereth
to
face
so
the
heart
of
man
to
man
yes
and
all
spirit
being
mutually
attractive
far
more
than
this
i
preach
to
you
that
through
help
of
eyes
that
are
dim
of
ears
that
are
dull
by
instinct
of
something
yet
undefined
call
it
soul
it
wants
no
less
a
name
man
has
a
native
impulse
and
attraction
and
yearning
to
merge
himself
in
that
harmony
and
be
one
with
it
a
spirit
of
adoption
as
st
paul
says
whereby
we
cry
father
and
because
ye
are
sons
god
hath
sent
forth
the
spirit
of
his
son
into
your
hearts
crying
that
is
to
say
we
know
we
have
something
within
us
correspondent
to
the
harmony
and
i
make
bold
to
say
unless
we
have
deadened
it
with
low
desires
worthy
to
join
in
it
even
in
his
common
daily
life
man
is
for
ever
seeking
after
harmony
in
avoidance
of
chaos
he
cultivates
habits
by
the
clock
he
forms
committees
governments
hierarchies
laws
constitutions
by
which
as
he
hopes
a
system
of
society
will
work
in
tune
but
these
are
childish
imitations
underplay
on
the
great
motive
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
quid
aliud
est
anima
quam
deus
in
corpore
humano
hospitans
v
gentlemen
you
may
be
thinking
that
i
have
brought
you
a
long
way
round
that
the
hour
is
wearing
late
and
that
we
are
yet
far
from
the
prey
we
first
hunted
on
the
line
of
but
be
patient
for
a
minute
or
two
for
almost
we
have
our
hand
on
the
animal
if
the
kingdom
of
god
or
anything
correspondent
to
it
be
within
us
even
in
such
specks
of
dust
as
we
separately
are
why
that
and
that
only
can
be
the
light
by
which
you
or
i
may
hope
to
read
the
universal
that
and
that
only
deserves
the
name
of
nay
i
can
convince
you
in
a
moment
let
me
recall
a
passage
of
emerson
quoted
by
me
on
the
morning
i
first
had
the
honour
to
address
an
audience
in
cambridge
it
is
remarkable
says
he
that
involuntarily
we
always
read
as
superior
beings
universal
history
the
poets
the
romancers
do
not
in
their
stateliest
pictures
anywhere
make
us
feel
that
we
intrude
that
this
is
for
better
men
but
rather
is
it
true
that
in
their
grandest
strokes
we
feel
most
at
home
all
that
shakespeare
says
of
the
king
yonder
slip
of
a
boy
that
reads
in
the
corner
feels
to
be
true
of
himself
it
is
remarkable
as
emerson
says
and
yet
as
we
now
see
quite
simple
a
learned
man
may
patronise
a
less
learned
one
but
the
kingdom
of
god
can
not
patronise
the
kingdom
of
god
the
larger
the
smaller
there
large
and
small
between
these
two
mysteries
of
a
harmonious
universe
and
the
inward
soul
are
granted
to
live
among
us
certain
men
whose
minds
and
souls
throw
out
filaments
more
delicate
than
ours
vibrating
to
far
messages
which
they
bring
home
to
report
them
to
us
and
these
men
we
call
prophets
poets
masters
great
artists
and
when
they
write
it
we
call
their
report
literature
but
it
is
by
the
spark
in
us
that
we
read
it
and
not
all
the
fire
of
god
that
was
in
shakespeare
can
dare
to
patronise
the
little
spark
in
me
if
it
did
i
can
see
with
blake
the
angelic
host
throw
down
their
spears
and
water
heaven
with
their
tears
vi
to
nurse
that
spark
common
to
the
king
the
sage
the
poorest
child
to
fan
to
draw
up
to
a
flame
to
to
recognise
that
it
is
divine
yet
frail
tender
sometimes
easily
tired
easily
quenched
under
piles
of
to
let
it
run
at
play
very
often
even
more
often
to
let
it
rest
in
what
wordsworth
calls
a
wise
passiveness
passive
to
use
a
simile
of
coventry
patmore
as
a
photographic
plate
which
finds
stars
that
no
telescope
can
discover
simply
by
waiting
with
its
face
turned
upward
to
mother
it
in
short
as
wise
mothers
do
their
children
this
is
what
i
mean
by
the
art
of
reading
for
all
great
literature
i
would
lastly
observe
is
gentle
towards
that
spirit
which
learns
of
it
it
teaches
by
not
by
which
is
what
many
philosophers
try
to
do
and
in
trying
break
their
jugs
and
spill
the
contents
literature
understands
man
and
of
what
he
is
capable
philosophy
on
the
other
hand
may
not
be
and
crabbed
as
dull
fools
suppose
but
the
trouble
with
most
of
its
practitioners
is
that
they
try
to
the
universe
now
the
man
who
could
comprehend
the
universe
would
comprehend
god
and
be
a
able
to
dethrone
him
and
in
the
arrogance
of
his
intellectual
conceit
full
ready
to
make
the
attempt
footnote
do
you
remember
by
the
by
samuel
rogers
lines
on
lady
jane
grey
they
have
always
seemed
to
me
very
beautiful
like
her
most
gentle
most
unfortunate
crown
but
to
die
who
in
her
chamber
sate
musing
with
plato
though
the
horn
was
blown
and
every
ear
and
every
heart
was
won
and
all
in
green
array
were
chasing
down
the
sun
lecture
iii
children
reading
i
wednesday
january
i
have
often
wished
gentlemen
that
some
more
winning
name
could
be
found
for
the
thing
we
call
education
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
wistfully
that
had
we
made
a
better
thing
of
it
we
should
long
ago
have
found
a
more
amiable
a
blither
name
for
after
all
it
concerns
the
child
and
is
it
quite
an
accident
that
weaning
him
away
from
lovely
things
that
so
lovelily
call
themselves
we
can
find
no
more
alluring
titles
for
the
streets
into
which
we
entrap
him
than
facilities
examinations
elementary
or
primary
and
secondary
codes
classes
authorities
and
and
and
and
expressive
terms
no
doubt
but
i
ask
with
the
poet
who
can
track
a
grace
naked
foot
amid
them
all
take
even
such
words
as
should
be
perennially
beautiful
by
such
as
does
the
one
o
ode
on
a
distant
prospect
of
clapham
academy
call
up
visions
of
that
green
lawn
by
cephissus
of
its
olives
and
plane
trees
and
the
mirrored
statues
among
which
plato
walked
and
held
discourse
with
his
few
does
the
other
as
a
rule
invite
to
haunts
o
god
o
montreal
where
you
can
be
secure
of
communion
with
apollo
and
the
nine
answer
if
the
word
academy
does
not
first
call
up
to
the
mind
some
place
where
small
boys
are
crammed
the
word
museum
some
place
where
bigger
game
are
stuffed
and
yet
even
are
sound
words
if
only
we
would
make
the
things
correspond
with
their
meanings
the
meaning
of
is
a
leading
out
a
not
an
of
something
on
somebody
a
catechism
or
an
uncle
upon
the
child
but
an
eliciting
of
what
is
within
him
now
if
you
followed
my
last
lecture
we
find
that
which
is
within
him
to
be
no
less
potentially
than
the
kingdom
of
god
i
grant
that
this
potentiality
is
between
the
ages
of
four
and
sixteen
not
always
perhaps
not
often
evident
the
boy
in
bagehot
phrase
small
urchin
whom
we
know
has
this
in
common
with
the
fruit
for
which
he
congenitally
sins
that
his
very
virtues
in
immaturity
are
apt
setting
the
teeth
on
edge
to
be
mistaken
for
vices
a
writer
to
whom
i
shall
recur
has
said
if
an
englishman
who
had
never
before
tasted
an
apple
were
to
eat
one
in
july
he
would
probably
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
hard
sour
indigestible
fruit
in
sin
and
shapen
in
iniquity
fit
only
to
be
consigned
to
perdition
on
a
dust
heap
or
elsewhere
but
if
the
same
man
were
to
wait
till
october
and
then
eat
an
apple
from
the
same
tree
he
would
find
that
the
sourness
had
ripened
into
wholesome
and
refreshing
acidity
the
hardness
into
firmness
of
fibre
which
besides
being
pleasant
to
the
palate
makes
the
apple
better
than
any
other
fruit
the
indigestibility
into
certain
valuable
dietetic
qualities
and
so
on
in
other
words
trench
manure
hoe
and
water
around
your
young
tree
and
patiently
allow
the
young
fruit
to
develop
of
its
own
juice
from
the
root
your
own
task
being
as
the
fruit
forms
but
to
bring
in
all
you
can
of
air
and
sunshine
upon
it
it
must
as
every
mother
and
nurse
knows
be
coaxed
to
realise
itself
to
develop
to
grow
from
its
individual
root
it
may
be
coaxed
and
trained
but
the
main
secret
lies
in
encouraging
it
to
grow
and
to
that
end
in
pouring
sunshine
upon
it
and
hoeing
after
each
visitation
of
tears
parentally
induced
every
child
wants
to
grow
every
child
wants
to
learn
during
his
first
year
or
so
of
life
he
fights
for
bodily
nutriment
almost
ferociously
from
the
age
of
two
or
thereabouts
he
valiantly
essays
the
conquest
of
articulate
speech
using
it
first
to
identify
his
father
or
his
mother
amid
the
common
herd
of
gentiles
next
to
demand
a
more
liberal
and
varied
dietary
anon
as
handmaid
of
his
imperious
will
to
learn
this
desire
still
in
the
nursery
climbs
like
dissolution
in
sonnet
from
low
to
high
from
a
craving
to
discover
experimentally
what
the
stomach
will
assimilate
and
what
reject
up
to
a
kingly
debonair
interest
in
teleology
our
young
gentleman
is
perfectly
at
ease
in
sion
he
wants
to
know
why
soldiers
are
or
were
red
and
if
they
were
born
so
whence
bread
and
milk
is
derived
and
would
it
be
good
manners
to
thank
the
neat
cow
for
both
why
mamma
married
papa
and
that
having
been
explained
and
thoughtfully
accepted
as
the
best
possible
arrangement
still
thoughtfully
not
in
the
least
censoriously
the
has
not
married
yet
he
falls
asleep
weighing
the
eligibility
of
various
spinsters
in
the
parish
his
brain
teeming
with
questions
he
asks
them
of
impulse
and
makes
his
discoveries
with
joy
he
passes
to
a
school
which
is
supposed
to
exist
for
the
purpose
of
answering
these
or
cognate
questions
even
before
he
asks
them
and
behold
he
is
not
happy
or
he
is
happy
enough
at
play
or
at
doing
in
class
the
things
that
should
not
be
done
in
class
his
master
writes
home
that
he
suffers
in
his
school
work
having
always
more
animal
spirits
than
are
required
for
his
immediate
purposes
what
is
the
trouble
you
can
not
explain
it
by
for
it
attacks
day
boys
alike
with
boarders
you
can
not
explain
it
by
saying
that
all
true
learning
involves
unless
you
make
that
miserable
word
a
mendicant
and
force
it
to
beg
the
question
is
you
feel
to
be
who
sweeps
a
room
as
for
thy
laws
makes
that
and
th
action
fine
and
anyhow
this
child
learned
one
language
english
a
most
difficult
one
eagerly
of
the
nursery
through
which
i
passed
only
one
sister
wept
while
learning
to
read
and
that
was
over
a
scholastic
work
entitled
reading
without
tears
do
you
know
a
chapter
in
mr
william
canton
book
the
invisible
playmate
in
which
as
carlyle
dealt
in
sartor
resartus
with
an
imaginary
treatise
by
an
imaginary
herr
teufelsdröckh
as
matthew
arnold
in
friendship
garland
with
the
imaginary
letters
of
an
imaginary
arminius
germany
in
happier
days
lent
the
world
these
playful
philosophical
spirits
so
the
later
author
invents
an
old
village
grandpapa
with
the
of
altegans
and
a
printed
in
scarecrow
duodecimo
on
pages
and
entitled
erster
schulgang
or
day
at
school
the
poem
opens
with
a
wonderful
vision
of
children
delightful
as
it
is
unexpected
as
romantic
in
presentment
as
it
is
commonplace
in
fact
all
over
the
world
and
all
under
it
too
when
their
time
comes
the
children
are
trooping
to
school
the
great
globe
swings
round
out
of
the
dark
into
the
sun
there
is
always
morning
somewhere
and
for
ever
in
this
shifting
region
of
the
the
good
altegans
sees
the
little
ones
afoot
shining
companies
and
groups
couples
and
bright
solitary
figures
for
they
all
seem
to
have
a
soft
heavenly
light
about
them
he
sees
them
in
country
lanes
and
rustic
villages
on
lonely
moorlands
he
sees
them
on
the
hillsides
in
the
woods
on
the
that
cross
the
brook
in
the
glen
along
the
seacliffs
and
on
the
sands
trespassing
on
the
railway
lines
making
short
cuts
through
the
corn
sitting
in
the
he
sees
them
in
the
crowded
streets
of
smoky
cities
in
small
rocky
islands
in
places
far
inland
where
the
sea
is
known
only
as
a
strange
tradition
the
of
the
planet
is
alive
with
them
one
hears
their
pattering
footsteps
everywhere
and
as
the
vast
continents
sweep
out
of
the
high
shadow
which
reaches
beyond
the
moon
and
as
new
nations
with
cities
and
villages
their
fields
woods
mountains
and
rise
up
into
the
lo
fresh
troops
and
still
fresh
troops
and
yet
again
fresh
troops
of
these
children
of
the
dawn
what
are
weather
and
season
to
this
incessant
panorama
of
childhood
the
pigmy
people
trudge
through
the
snow
on
moor
and
wade
down
flooded
roads
are
not
to
be
daunted
by
wind
or
rain
frost
or
the
white
smother
of
and
bakers
at
fisticuffs
most
beautiful
picture
of
all
he
sees
them
travelling
schoolward
by
the
late
moonlight
which
now
and
again
in
the
winter
months
precedes
the
tardy
dawn
that
vision
strikes
me
as
being
poetically
true
as
well
as
delightful
by
which
i
mean
that
it
is
not
sentimental
we
know
that
it
ought
to
be
true
that
in
a
world
according
to
our
best
wishes
for
it
it
would
be
true
it
expresses
the
natural
love
of
age
brooding
on
the
natural
eager
joy
of
children
but
that
natural
eager
joy
is
just
what
our
schools
in
the
matter
of
reading
conscientiously
kill
in
this
matter
of
children
reading
we
stand
just
now
or
halt
just
now
between
two
ways
the
parent
i
believe
has
decisively
won
back
to
the
right
one
which
good
mothers
never
quite
forsook
there
was
an
interval
lasting
from
the
early
years
of
the
last
century
until
midway
in
queen
victoria
reign
and
a
little
beyond
when
children
were
mainly
brought
up
on
the
assumption
of
natural
vice
they
might
adore
father
and
mother
and
yearn
to
be
better
friends
with
papa
but
there
was
the
old
adam
a
quickening
evil
spirit
there
were
his
imps
always
in
the
way
confound
them
i
myself
lived
with
excellent
grandparents
for
several
years
on
pretty
close
terms
with
hell
and
an
eye
until
i
grew
so
utterly
weary
of
both
that
i
have
never
since
had
the
smallest
use
for
either
some
of
you
may
have
read
as
a
curious
book
the
agreeable
history
called
the
fairchild
family
in
which
mr
fairchild
leads
his
naughty
children
afield
to
a
gallows
by
a
and
seating
them
under
the
swinging
corpse
of
a
malefactor
deduces
how
easily
they
may
come
to
this
if
they
go
on
as
they
have
been
going
the
authors
of
such
monitory
or
cautionary
tales
understood
but
one
form
of
development
the
development
of
original
sin
you
stole
a
pin
and
proceeded
by
fatal
steps
to
the
penitentiary
you
threw
a
stick
at
a
pheasant
turned
poacher
shot
a
gamekeeper
and
ended
on
the
gallows
you
were
always
eric
and
it
was
always
little
by
little
with
you
stay
memory
preserves
one
gem
from
a
sunday
school
dialogue
one
intaglio
of
childhood
springing
fully
armed
from
the
head
of
satan
q
where
hast
thou
been
this
sabbath
morning
i
have
been
coursing
of
the
squirrel
q
art
not
afraid
so
to
desecrate
the
lord
day
with
idle
sport
a
by
no
means
for
i
should
tell
you
that
i
am
an
atheist
i
forget
what
happened
to
that
boy
but
doubtless
it
was
as
it
should
have
been
something
drastic
the
spell
of
prohibition
of
repression
lies
so
strong
upon
these
authors
that
when
they
try
to
break
away
from
it
to
appeal
to
something
better
than
fear
in
the
child
and
essay
to
amuse
they
become
merely
silly
for
an
example
in
verse
if
human
beings
only
knew
what
sorrows
little
birds
go
through
i
think
that
even
boys
would
never
think
it
sport
or
fun
to
stand
and
fire
a
frightful
gun
for
nothing
but
the
noise
for
another
instructional
and
quite
a
good
so
far
as
it
goes
william
and
mary
came
next
to
the
throne
when
mary
died
there
was
william
alone
now
for
a
story
of
it
comes
from
the
book
reading
without
tears
that
made
my
small
sister
weep
she
did
not
weep
over
the
story
because
she
did
not
claim
to
be
an
angel
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
donkey
that
went
into
the
sea
with
the
little
cart
a
lady
drove
the
cart
down
to
the
beach
she
had
six
children
with
her
three
little
ones
sat
in
the
cart
by
her
side
three
bigger
girls
ran
before
the
cart
when
they
came
to
the
beach
the
lady
and
the
children
got
out
very
good
so
far
it
opens
like
the
story
of
nausicaa
odyssey
book
vi
lines
the
lady
wished
the
donkey
to
bathe
its
legs
in
the
sea
to
make
it
strong
and
clean
but
the
donkey
did
not
like
to
go
near
the
sea
so
the
lady
bound
a
brown
shawl
over
its
eyes
and
she
bade
the
big
girls
lead
it
close
to
the
waves
suddenly
a
big
wave
rushed
to
the
land
the
girls
started
back
to
avoid
the
wave
and
they
let
go
the
donkey
rein
the
donkey
was
alarmed
by
the
noise
the
girls
made
and
it
went
into
the
sea
not
knowing
where
it
was
going
because
it
was
not
able
to
see
the
girls
ran
screaming
to
the
lady
crying
out
donkey
is
in
the
sea
there
it
was
going
further
and
further
into
the
sea
till
the
cart
was
hidden
by
the
billows
the
donkey
sank
lower
and
lower
every
moment
till
no
part
of
it
was
seen
but
the
ears
for
the
brown
shawl
was
over
its
nose
and
mouth
now
the
children
began
to
bawl
and
to
bellow
but
no
one
halloed
so
loud
as
the
little
boy
of
four
his
name
was
merty
he
feared
that
the
donkey
was
drowned
two
fishermen
were
in
a
boat
far
away
they
said
hear
howls
and
shrieks
on
the
shore
perhaps
a
boy
or
girl
is
drowning
let
us
go
and
save
him
so
they
rowed
hard
and
they
soon
came
to
the
poor
donkey
and
saw
its
ears
peeping
out
of
the
sea
the
donkey
was
just
going
to
sink
when
they
lifted
it
up
by
the
jaws
and
seized
the
bridle
and
dragged
it
along
the
children
on
the
shore
shouted
aloud
for
joy
the
donkey
with
the
cart
came
safe
to
land
the
poor
creature
was
weak
and
dripping
wet
the
fishermen
unbound
its
eyes
and
said
to
the
lady
can
not
think
how
this
thing
came
to
be
over
its
eyes
the
lady
said
she
wished
she
had
not
bound
up
its
eyes
and
she
gave
the
shillings
in
her
purse
to
the
fishermen
who
had
saved
her
donkey
now
every
child
knows
that
a
donkey
may
change
into
a
fairy
prince
that
is
a
truth
of
imagination
but
to
be
polite
and
say
nothing
of
the
lady
every
child
knows
that
so
donkey
would
be
ass
enough
to
behave
as
in
this
narrative
and
the
good
parents
who
throughout
the
later
century
and
the
inflicted
this
stuff
upon
children
were
sinning
against
the
light
perrault
fairy
tales
and
madame
were
to
their
hand
in
translations
le
cabinet
des
fées
which
includes
these
and
galland
arabian
nights
and
many
another
collection
of
delectable
stories
extends
on
my
shelves
to
volumes
the
last
volume
appeared
during
the
fury
of
the
french
revolution
the
brothers
grimm
published
the
first
volume
of
their
immortal
tales
in
the
second
in
a
capital
selection
from
them
charmingly
rendered
was
edited
by
our
edgar
taylor
in
and
drew
from
sir
walter
scott
a
letter
of
which
some
sentences
are
worth
our
pondering
he
writes
there
is
also
a
sort
of
wild
fairy
interest
in
these
tales
which
makes
me
think
them
fully
better
adapted
to
awaken
the
imagination
and
soften
the
heart
of
childhood
than
the
stories
which
have
been
in
later
years
composed
for
them
in
the
latter
case
their
minds
are
as
it
were
put
into
the
stocks
and
the
moral
always
consists
in
good
moral
conduct
being
crowned
with
temporal
success
truth
is
i
would
not
give
one
tear
shed
over
little
red
riding
hood
for
all
the
benefit
to
be
derived
from
a
hundred
histories
of
jemmy
goodchild
few
nowadays
i
doubt
remember
gammer
grethel
she
has
been
ousted
by
completer
maybe
far
better
translations
of
the
grimms
household
tales
but
turning
back
the
other
day
to
the
old
volume
for
the
old
sake
sake
as
we
say
in
the
west
i
came
on
the
preface
no
child
troubles
with
a
preface
and
on
these
wise
words
much
might
be
urged
against
that
too
rigid
and
philosophic
we
might
rather
say
unphilosophic
exclusion
of
works
of
fancy
and
fiction
from
the
libraries
of
children
which
is
advocated
by
some
our
imagination
is
surely
as
susceptible
of
improvement
by
exercise
as
our
judgment
or
our
memory
and
that
admirable
sentence
gentlemen
is
the
real
text
of
my
discourse
i
lay
no
sentimental
stress
upon
ode
and
its
doctrine
that
lies
about
us
in
our
infancy
it
was
as
you
know
a
favourite
doctrine
with
our
platonists
of
the
century
and
critics
who
trace
back
the
ode
intimations
of
immortality
to
henry
happy
those
early
days
when
i
shined
in
my
might
connect
it
with
a
dozen
passages
from
authors
of
that
century
here
is
one
from
centuries
of
meditations
by
that
poor
welsh
parson
thomas
traherne
whom
i
quoted
to
you
the
other
day
those
pure
and
virgin
apprehensions
i
had
from
the
womb
and
that
divine
light
wherewith
i
was
born
are
the
best
unto
this
day
wherein
i
can
see
the
universe
by
the
gift
of
god
they
attended
me
into
the
world
and
by
his
special
favour
i
remember
them
till
now
certainly
adam
in
paradise
had
not
more
sweet
and
curious
apprehensions
of
the
world
than
i
when
i
was
a
child
and
here
is
another
from
john
earle
character
of
child
in
his
microcosmography
his
father
hath
writ
him
as
his
own
little
story
wherein
he
reads
those
days
of
his
life
that
he
can
not
remember
and
sighs
to
see
what
innocence
he
has
he
is
the
christian
example
and
the
old
man
relapse
the
one
imitates
his
pureness
and
the
other
falls
into
his
simplicity
could
he
put
off
his
body
with
his
little
coat
he
had
got
eternity
without
a
burthen
and
exchang
but
one
heaven
for
another
bethinking
me
again
of
small
urchin
whom
we
know
i
suspect
an
amiable
fallacy
in
all
this
i
doubt
if
when
he
scales
an
tree
which
is
neither
his
own
nor
his
papa
he
does
so
under
impulse
of
any
conscious
yearning
back
to
hierusalem
his
happy
home
where
trees
for
evermore
bear
fruit
at
any
rate
i
have
an
orchard
and
he
has
put
up
many
excuses
but
never
yet
that
he
was
recollecting
sion
still
the
doctrine
holds
affinity
with
the
belief
which
i
firmly
hold
and
tried
to
explain
to
you
with
persuasion
last
term
that
boy
or
man
you
and
i
the
microcosms
do
sensibly
or
insensibly
yearn
through
what
we
feel
to
be
best
in
us
to
up
with
the
greater
harmony
that
by
poetry
or
religion
or
whatnot
we
have
that
within
us
which
craves
to
be
drawn
out
and
linked
up
now
the
rule
of
the
nursery
in
the
last
century
rested
on
original
sin
and
consequently
and
quite
logically
tended
not
to
educate
but
to
repress
there
are
no
new
of
the
days
when
your
grandmothers
wore
crinolines
i
know
for
i
have
searched
mothers
and
nurses
taught
the
old
ones
the
three
bears
still
found
one
after
another
that
has
been
sleeping
in
my
bed
fatima
continued
to
call
anne
do
you
see
anyone
coming
the
wolf
to
show
her
teeth
under
her
nightcap
and
snarl
out
o
great
moment
the
better
to
eat
you
with
my
dear
but
the
evangelicals
held
field
those
of
our
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
who
understood
joy
and
must
have
had
fairies
for
ministers
those
of
our
grandmothers
who
played
croquet
through
hoop
with
a
bell
and
practised
cupid
own
sport
archery
those
of
our
grandfathers
who
wore
jolly
trousers
and
dundreary
whiskers
and
built
the
crystal
palace
and
drove
to
the
derby
in
with
dutch
dolls
stuck
about
the
brim
circa
unum
caput
tumultuantes
and
those
splendid
uncles
who
used
to
descend
on
the
old
school
in
a
shower
of
gold
at
the
very
least
all
these
should
have
trailed
fairies
with
them
in
a
cloud
but
in
practice
the
evangelical
parent
held
the
majority
put
away
all
toys
but
noah
ark
on
sundays
and
voted
the
fairies
down
i
know
not
who
converted
the
parents
it
may
have
been
that
benefactor
of
europe
hans
christian
andersen
born
at
odensee
in
denmark
in
april
he
died
near
copenhagen
in
having
by
a
few
months
outlived
his
birthday
i
like
to
think
that
his
genius
a
continuing
influence
over
a
long
generation
did
more
than
anything
else
to
convert
the
parents
the
schools
always
more
royalist
than
the
king
professionally
bleak

dull

repressive
rather
than
educative
held
on
to
a
tradition
which
though
it
had
to
be
on
the
sly
every
intelligent
mother
and
nurse
had
done
her
best
to
evade
the
schools
made
a
boy
life
penitential
on
a
system
they
discovered
athletics
as
a
for
high
spirits
they
could
not
cope
with
and
promptly
made
that
compulsory
they
went
on
to
make
athletics
a
religion
now
athletics
are
not
properly
a
religious
exercise
and
their
meaning
evaporates
as
soon
as
you
enlist
them
in
the
service
of
repression
they
are
being
used
to
do
the
exact
opposite
of
that
for
which
god
meant
them
things
are
better
now
but
in
those
times
how
many
a
boy
having
long
looked
forward
to
it
rejoiced
in
his
last
day
at
school
i
know
surely
enough
what
must
be
in
your
minds
at
this
point
i
am
running
up
my
head
hard
against
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
against
the
doctrine
that
in
dealing
with
a
child
you
are
dealing
with
a
nature
with
a
human
soul
in
sin
unregenerate
except
by
repression
and
therefore
that
repression
and
more
repression
be
the
only
logical
way
with
your
original
sinners
well
then
i
am
i
have
loved
children
all
my
life
studied
them
in
the
nursery
studied
them
for
years
ten
or
twelve
years
intimately
in
elementary
schools
i
know
for
a
surety
if
i
have
acquired
any
knowledge
that
the
child
is
a
of
god
rather
than
a
of
wrath
and
here
before
you
i
proclaim
that
to
connect
in
any
child
mind
the
book
of
joshua
with
the
gospels
to
make
its
jehovah
identical
in
that
young
mind
with
the
father
of
mercy
of
whom
jesus
was
the
son
to
confuse
as
we
do
in
any
school
in
this
land
between
and
that
bloodthirsty
tribal
deity
whom
the
hohenzollern
family
invokes
with
the
true
god
the
father
is
a
blasphemous
usage
and
a
curse
but
let
me
get
away
to
milder
heresies
if
you
will
concede
for
a
moment
that
the
better
way
with
a
child
is
to
draw
out
to
rather
than
to
repress
what
is
in
him
let
us
observe
what
he
instinctively
wants
now
first
of
course
he
wants
to
eat
and
drink
and
to
run
about
when
he
passes
beyond
these
merely
animal
desires
to
what
we
may
call
the
instinct
of
growth
in
his
soul
how
does
he
proceed
i
think
mr
holmes
whom
i
have
already
quoted
very
fairly
sets
out
these
desires
as
any
person
can
perceive
them
the
child
desires
to
talk
and
to
listen
to
act
in
the
dramatic
sense
of
the
word
to
draw
paint
and
model
to
dance
and
sing
to
know
the
why
of
things
to
construct
things
now
i
shall
have
something
to
say
by
and
by
on
the
amazing
preponderance
in
this
list
of
those
instincts
which
aristotle
would
have
called
this
morning
i
take
only
the
least
imitative
of
all
the
desire
to
know
the
why
of
things
surely
you
know
taking
only
this
that
the
admitting
a
child
to
all
or
almost
all
palaces
of
knowledge
is
his
ability
to
when
he
has
grasped
that
key
of
his
he
can
with
perseverance
unlock
all
doors
to
all
the
avenues
of
knowledge
more
he
has
the
passport
to
heavens
unguessed
you
will
perceive
at
once
that
what
i
mean
here
by
is
the
capacity
for
silent
reading
taking
a
book
apart
and
mastering
it
and
you
will
bear
in
mind
the
wonder
that
i
preached
to
you
in
a
previous
lecture
that
great
literature
never
condescends
that
what
yonder
boy
in
a
corner
reads
of
a
king
is
happening
to
do
you
suppose
that
in
an
elementary
school
one
child
in
ten
reads
thus
listen
to
a
wise
whose
words
i
can
corroborate
of
experience
the
first
thing
that
strikes
the
visitor
who
enters
an
ordinary
elementary
school
while
a
reading
lesson
is
in
progress
is
that
the
children
are
not
reading
at
all
in
the
accepted
sense
of
the
word
they
are
not
reading
to
themselves
not
studying
not
mastering
the
contents
of
the
book
not
assimilating
the
mental
and
spiritual
nutriment
that
it
may
be
supposed
to
contain
they
are
standing
up
one
by
one
and
reading
aloud
to
their
teacher
ah
but
i
have
seen
far
worse
than
that
i
have
visited
and
condemned
rural
schools
where
the
practice
was
to
stand
a
class
up
say
a
class
of
thirty
children
and
make
them
read
in
unison
which
meant
of
course
that
the
front
row
chanted
out
the
lesson
while
the
back
rows
made
inarticulate
noises
i
well
remember
one
such
exhibition
in
a
remote
country
school
on
the
cornish
hills
and
having
my
attention
arrested
midway
by
the
face
of
a
girl
in
the
third
row
she
was
a
strikingly
beautiful
child
with
that
combination
of
bright
auburn
almost
flaming
hair
with
dark
eyebrows
dark
eyelashes
dark
eyes
which
of
itself
arrests
your
gaze
being
so
rare
and
those
eyes
seemed
to
challenge
me
half
scornfully
and
ask
you
really
taken
in
by
all
this
well
i
soon
stopped
the
performance
and
required
each
child
to
read
separately
whereupon
it
turned
out
that
in
the
upper
standards
of
this
school
of
or
children
one
only
this
disdainful
girl
could
get
through
half
a
dozen
easy
sentences
with
credit
she
read
well
and
intelligently
being
accustomed
to
read
to
herself
at
home
i
daresay
that
this
bad
old
method
of
is
dead
by
this
time
reading
aloud
and
is
excellent
for
several
purposes
it
tests
capacity
it
teaches
correct
pronunciation
by
practice
as
well
as
the
mastery
of
difficult
words
it
provides
a
good
teacher
with
frequent
opportunities
of
helping
the
child
to
understand
what
he
reads
but
as
his
schooling
proceeds
he
should
be
accustomed
more
and
more
to
read
to
himself
for
that
i
repeat
is
the
lecture
iv
children
reading
ii
wednesday
february
i
in
our
talk
gentlemen
about
children
reading
we
left
off
upon
a
list
drawn
up
by
mr
holmes
in
his
book
is
and
what
might
be
of
the
things
that
apart
from
physical
nourishment
and
exercise
a
child
instinctively
desires
he
desires
to
talk
and
to
listen
to
act
in
the
dramatic
sense
of
the
word
to
draw
paint
and
model
to
dance
and
sing
to
know
the
why
of
things
to
construct
things
let
us
scan
through
this
catalogue
briefly
in
its
order
no
talk
and
to
mr
holmes
calls
this
communicative
every
child
wants
to
talk
with
those
about
him
or
at
any
rate
with
his
chosen
ones
his
parents
brothers
sisters
nurse
governess
gardener
if
he
possess
these
last
with
other
children
even
if
his
dear
papa
is
poor
to
tell
them
what
he
has
been
doing
seeing
feeling
and
to
listen
to
what
they
have
to
tell
him
nos
our
author
calls
this
the
instinct
draw
paint
and
this
the
instinct
dance
and
this
the
instinct
but
obviously
all
these
are
what
aristotle
would
call
instincts
in
a
sense
i
shall
presently
explain
even
as
no
acting
like
no
talking
and
listening
comes
of
craving
for
sympathy
in
fact
as
we
go
on
you
will
see
that
these
instincts
overlap
and
are
not
strictly
separable
though
we
separate
them
just
now
for
convenience
no
know
the
why
of
the
instinct
this
being
the
one
which
gives
most
trouble
to
parents
parsons
governesses
conventional
schoolmasters
to
all
persons
who
pretend
to
know
what
they
do
and
are
ashamed
to
tell
what
they
do
is
of
course
the
most
ruthlessly
repressed
time
is
come
the
infant
said
talk
of
many
things
of
babies
storks
and
cabbages
and
having
studied
the
evangelists
window
facing
the
family
pew
and
whether
cows
have
wings
the
answer
in
my
experience
is
invariably
stern
and
the
negative
in
tolerant
moments
compromising
on
like
a
good
boy
and
see
but
we
singled
out
this
instinct
and
discussed
it
in
our
last
lecture
no
construct
the
instinct
i
quote
mr
holmes
here
after
analysis
comes
synthesis
the
child
pulls
his
toys
to
pieces
in
order
that
he
may
if
possible
reconstruct
them
the
ends
that
he
sets
before
himself
are
those
which
comte
set
before
the
human
race
pour
prévoir
afin
de
pouvoir
induire
pour
déduire
afin
de
the
desire
to
make
things
to
build
things
up
to
control
ways
and
means
to
master
the
resources
of
nature
to
put
his
knowledge
of
her
laws
and
facts
to
practical
use
is
strong
in
his
soul
give
him
a
box
of
bricks
and
he
will
spend
hours
in
building
and
rebuilding
houses
churches
set
him
on
a
sandy
shore
with
a
spade
and
a
pail
and
he
will
spend
hours
in
constructing
fortified
castles
with
deep
encircling
moats
again
obviously
this
constructive
instinct
overlaps
with
the
imitative
ones
construction
for
example
enters
into
the
art
of
making
and
has
also
been
applied
in
the
past
to
great
poetry
if
you
do
keep
a
sharp
eye
in
directing
this
instinct
it
may
conceivably
end
in
an
othello
or
in
a
divina
commedia
ii
without
preaching
on
any
of
the
others
however
i
take
three
of
the
six
instincts
scheduled
by
mr
holmes
the
three
which
you
will
allow
to
be
almost
purely
imitative
they
are
acting
drawing
painting
modelling
dancing
and
singing
now
let
us
turn
to
the
very
first
page
of
aristotle
poetics
and
what
do
we
read
epic
poetry
and
tragedy
comedy
also
and
dithyrambic
poetry
and
the
greater
part
of
the
music
of
the
flute
and
of
the
lyre
are
all
in
general
modes
of
imitation
for
as
their
are
persons
who
represent
a
number
of
things
by
colours
and
drawings
and
others
vocally
so
it
is
with
the
arts
above
mentioned
they
all
imitate
by
rhythm
language
harmony
singly
or
combined
even
dancing
he
goes
on
imitates
character
emotion
and
action
by
rhythmical
movement
now
having
touched
on
let
me
say
a
few
words
upon
these
aesthetic
imitative
instincts
of
acting
dancing
singing
before
i
follow
aristotle
into
his
explanation
of
the
origin
of
poetry
which
i
think
we
may
agree
to
be
the
highest
subject
of
our
art
of
reading
and
to
hold
promise
of
its
highest
reward
every
wise
mother
sings
or
croons
to
her
child
and
dances
him
on
her
knee
she
does
so
by
sure
instinct
long
before
the
small
body
can
respond
or
his
eyes
always
blue
at
first
and
unfathomably
aged
return
her
any
answer
it
lulls
him
into
the
long
spells
of
sleep
so
necessary
for
his
first
growth
by
and
by
when
he
has
found
his
legs
he
begins
to
skip
and
even
before
he
has
found
articulate
speech
to
croon
for
himself
pass
a
stage
and
you
find
him
importing
speech
drama
dance
incantation
into
his
games
with
his
playmates
watch
a
cluster
of
children
as
they
enact
here
we
go
gathering
nuts
in
may
eloquent
line
it
is
just
what
they
are
doing
or

or

wedding

performed
so
hastily
it
were
more
descriptive
to
say
for

within

the

and
resume
the
measure
chanting
now

we
wish
you
joy
first
a

and
then

the
order
i
suspect
dictated
by
exigencies
of
rhyme
rather
than
of
eugenics
as
dryden
confessed
that
a
rhyme
had
often
helped
him
to
a
thought
and
yet
i
do
know
for
the
incantation
goes
on
to
redress
the
balance
in
a
way
that
looks
scientific
ten
years
after
son
and
daughter
and
now
practically
and
now
miss

come
out

the

end
by
supplying
the
applause
which
in
these
days
of
division
of
labour
is
commonly
left
to
the
audience
iii
well
there
you
have
it
all
acting
singing
dancing
choral
movement
enlisted
ancillary
to
the
domestic
drama
and
when
you
start
collecting
evidence
of
these
imitative
instincts
blent
in
childhood
the
mass
will
soon
amaze
you
and
leave
you
no
room
to
be
surprised
that
many
learned
scholars
on
the
supposition
that
uncivilised
man
is
a
child
more
or
less
and
at
least
so
much
of
child
that
one
can
argue
through
children
practice
to
his
have
found
the
historical
origin
of
poetry
itself
in
these
primitive
performances
poetry
as
they
call
it
i
propose
to
discuss
with
you
may
be
neat
term
in
a
lecture
not
belonging
to
this
the
likelihood
that
what
we
call
specifically
ballad
or
poetry
originated
thus
here
is
a
wider
question
did
all
poetry
develop
out
of
this
historically
as
a
process
in
time
and
in
fact
these
scholars
among
whom
i
will
instance
one
of
the
most
learned
dr
gummere
hold
that
it
did
and
i
may
take
a
passage
from
dr
gummere
beginnings
of
poetry
to
show
you
how
they
call
in
the
practice
of
savage
races
to
support
their
theory
the
botocudos
of
south
america
are
according
to
dr
paul
ehrenreich
who
has
observed
them
an
ungentlemanly
tribe
low
in
the
social
scale
the
botocudos
are
little
better
than
a
leaderless
horde
and
pay
scant
respect
to
their
chieftain
they
live
only
for
their
immediate
bodily
needs
and
take
small
thought
for
the
morrow
still
less
for
the
past
no
traditions
no
legends
are
abroad
to
tell
them
of
their
forbears
they
still
use
gestures
to
express
feeling
and
ideas
while
the
number
of
words
which
imitate
a
given
sound
extraordinarily
great
an
action
or
an
object
is
named
by
imitating
the
sound
peculiar
to
it
and
sounds
are
doubled
to
express
greater
intensity
to
speak
is
to
speak
loudly
or
to
sing
is
and
now
for
their
aesthetic
life
their
song
dance
poetry
as
described
by
this
accurate
observer
festal
occasions
the
whole
horde
meets
by
night
round
the
camp
fire
for
a
dance
men
and
women
alternating
form
a
circle
each
dancer
lays
his
arms
about
the
necks
of
his
two
neighbours
and
the
entire
ring
begins
to
turn
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
while
all
the
dancers
stamp
strongly
and
in
rhythm
the
foot
that
is
advanced
and
drag
after
it
the
other
foot
now
with
drooping
heads
they
press
closer
and
closer
together
now
they
widen
the
circle
throughout
the
dance
resounds
a
monotonous
song
to
which
they
stamp
their
feet
often
one
can
hear
nothing
but
a
continually
repeated
aha
again
however
short
improvised
songs
in
which
we
are
told
the
doings
of
the
day
the
reasons
for
rejoicing
what
not
as
good
hunting
or
now
we
have
something
to
eat
or
brandy
is
good
to
the
aesthetic
value
of
these
south
american
utterances
dr
gummere
asks
in
a
footnote
far
is
it
inferior
to
the
sonorous
commonplaces
of
our
own
verse
say
the
psalm
of
life
i
really
can
not
answer
that
question
which
do
you
prefer
gentlemen
is
real
life
is
earnest
or
we
have
something
to
eat
i
must
leave
you
to
settle
it
with
the
food
controller
the
professor
goes
on
and
then
too
an
individual
begins
a
song
and
is
answered
by
the
rest
in
chorus
never
sing
without
dancing
never
dance
without
singing
and
have
but
one
word
to
express
both
song
and
as
the
unprejudiced
reader
sees
dr
gummere
proceeds
this
clear
and
admirable
account
confirms
the
doctrine
of
early
days
revived
with
fresh
ethnological
evidence
in
the
writings
of
dr
brown
and
of
adam
smith
that
dance
poetry
and
song
were
once
a
single
and
inseparable
function
and
is
in
itself
fatal
to
the
idea
of
rhythmic
prose
of
solitary
recitation
as
foundations
of
poetry
all
poetry
is
communal
holding
fast
to
the
rhythm
of
consent
as
to
the
one
sure
fact
iv
now
i
should
tell
you
gentlemen
that
i
hold
such
utterances
as
this
last
whatever
you
may
think
of
the
utterances
of
the
botocudos
to
be
exorbitant
that
i
distrust
all
attempts
to
build
up
say
paradise
lost
historically
from
the
yells
and
capers
of
recondite
savages
is
real
life
is
earnest
may
be
no
better
aesthetically
i
myself
think
it
a
little
better
than
we
have
something
to
eat
is
good
may
rival
pindar
greek
arioton
men
udor
and
indeed
puts
what
it
contains
of
truth
with
more
of
finality
less
of
provocation
though
pindar
at
once
follows
up
greek
arioton
men
udor
with
exquisite
poetry
but
you
can
not
truly
you
can
not
exhibit
the
steps
which
lead
up
from
is
good
to
such
lines
as
thus
with
the
year
seasons
return
but
not
to
me
returns
day
or
the
sweet
approach
of
even
or
morn
or
sight
of
vernal
bloom
or
summer
rose
or
flocks
or
herds
or
human
face
divine
i
bend
over
the
learned
page
pensively
and
i
seem
to
see
a
botocudo
professor
though
not
high
the
social
scale
they
may
have
such
things
visiting
cambridge
on
the
last
night
of
the
lent
races
and
reporting
of
its
inhabitants
as
follows
they
pay
scant
heed
to
their
chiefs
they
live
only
for
their
immediate
bodily
needs
and
take
small
thought
for
the
morrow
on
festal
occasions
the
whole
horde
meets
by
night
round
the
camp
fire
for
a
dance
each
dancer
lays
his
arms
about
the
necks
of
his
two
neighbours
stamping
strongly
with
one
foot
and
dragging
the
other
after
it
now
with
drooping
heads
they
press
closer
and
closer
together
now
they
widen
the
circle
often
one
can
hear
nothing
but
a
continually
repeated
aha
or
again
one
hears
short
improvised
songs
in
which
we
are
told
the
doings
of
the
day
the
reasons
for
rejoicing
what
not
as
hunting
old
naming
a
tribal
god
or
in
former
times
we
shall
be
but
a
short
while
or
now
and
then
too
an
individual
begins
a
song
and
is
answered
by
the
rest
in
chorus
such
as
for
he
is
an
estimable
person
beyond
possibility
of
gainsaying
the
chorus
twice
repeats
this
and
asseverates
that
they
are
following
a
custom
common
to
the
flotilla
the
expeditionary
force
and
even
their
rude
seats
of
learning
and
dr
gummere
or
somebody
else
comments
the
unprejudiced
reader
will
see
this
clear
and
admirable
account
confirms
our
hypothesis
that
in
communal
celebration
we
have
at
once
the
origin
and
model
of
three
poems
the
faerie
queene
paradise
lost
and
in
memoriam
recorded
as
having
been
composed
by
members
of
this
very
tribe
although
we
have
been
talking
of
instincts
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
steps
by
which
the
child
or
the
savage
following
an
instinct
attains
to
poetry
but
more
modestly
with
the
instinct
by
which
the
child
it
and
the
way
in
which
he
can
be
best
encouraged
to
read
and
improve
this
natural
liking
nor
are
we
even
concerned
here
to
define
poetry
it
suffices
our
present
purpose
to
consider
poetry
as
the
sort
of
thing
the
poets
write
but
obviously
if
we
find
a
philosopher
discussing
poetry
without
any
reference
to
children
and
independently
basing
it
upon
the
very
same
imitative
instincts
which
we
have
noted
in
children
we
have
some
promise
of
being
on
the
right
track
v
so
i
return
to
aristotle
aristotle
i
shall
in
fairness
say
does
not
anticipate
dr
gummere
to
contradict
or
refute
him
he
may
even
be
held
to
support
him
incidentally
but
he
sticks
to
business
and
this
is
what
he
says
poetics
iv
poetry
in
general
seems
to
have
sprung
from
two
causes
and
these
natural
causes
first
the
instinct
to
imitate
is
implanted
in
man
from
his
childhood
and
in
this
he
differs
from
other
animals
being
the
most
imitative
of
them
all
man
gets
his
first
learning
through
imitation
and
all
men
delight
in
seeing
things
imitated
this
is
clearly
shown
by
experience
to
imitate
then
being
instinctive
in
our
nature
so
too
we
have
an
instinct
for
harmony
and
rhythm
metre
being
manifestly
a
species
of
rhythm
and
man
being
born
to
these
instincts
and
little
by
little
improving
them
out
of
his
early
improvisations
created
poetry
combining
these
two
instincts
with
him
we
arrive
at
well
and
good
but
what
is
it
we
imitate
in
poetry
noble
things
or
mean
things
after
considering
this
putting
mean
things
aside
as
unworthy
and
voting
for
the
nobler
which
must
at
the
same
time
be
true
since
without
truth
there
can
be
no
real
nobility
aristotle
has
to
ask
what
way
true
true
to
ordinary
life
with
its
observed
defeats
of
the
right
by
the
wrong
or
true
as
again
instinct
tells
good
men
it
should
be
so
he
arrives
at
his
conclusion
that
a
true
thing
is
not
necessarily
truth
of
fact
in
a
world
where
truth
in
fact
is
so
often
belied
or
made
meaningless
not
the
record
that
alcibiades
went
somewhere
and
suffered
something
but
truth
to
the
universal
the
superior
demand
of
our
conscience
in
such
a
way
only
we
know
that
the
tempest
or
paradise
lost
or
the
ancient
mariner
or
prometheus
unbound
can
be
truer
than
any
police
report
yet
we
know
that
they
are
truer
in
essence
and
in
significance
since
they
appeal
to
eternal
verities
since
they
imitate
the
universal
whereas
the
police
report
chronicles
faithfully
as
in
duty
bound
even
usefully
in
its
way
events
which
may
nay
must
be
significant
somehow
but
can
not
at
best
be
better
to
us
than
phenomena
broken
ends
and
shards
vi
i
return
to
the
child
clearly
in
obeying
the
instinct
which
i
have
tried
to
illustrate
he
is
searching
to
realise
himself
and
as
educators
we
ought
to
help
this
effort
or
at
least
not
to
hinder
it
further
if
we
agree
with
aristotle
in
this
searching
to
realise
himself
through
imitation
what
will
the
child
most
nobly
and
naturally
imitate
he
will
imitate
what
aristotle
calls
universal
the
superior
demand
and
does
not
this
bring
us
back
to
consent
with
what
i
have
been
preaching
from
the
start
in
this
course
that
to
realise
ourselves
in
not
only
in
degree
transcends
mere
knowledge
and
activity
and
does
but
transcends
it
in
kind
it
is
not
only
what
the
child
unconsciously
longs
for
it
is
that
for
which
in
st
words
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
in
pain
together
until
now
craving
for
this
i
make
you
the
admission
as
emotionally
as
the
heart
may
be
thrilled
the
breast
surge
the
eyes
swell
with
tears
at
a
note
drawn
from
the
violin
feeling
that
somewhere
beyond
reach
we
have
a
lost
sister
and
she
speaks
to
our
soul
vii
who
that
has
been
a
child
has
not
felt
this
surprise
of
beauty
the
revelation
the
call
of
it
the
sounding
cataract
haunted
me
like
a
passion
yes
or
a
rainbow
on
the
spray
against
a
cliff
or
a
vista
of
lawns
between
descending
woods
or
a
vision
of
fish
moving
in
a
pool
under
the
hazel
shadow
who
has
not
felt
the
small
surcharged
heart
labouring
with
desire
to
express
it
i
preach
to
you
that
the
base
of
all
literature
of
all
poetry
of
all
theology
is
one
and
stands
on
one
rock
very
highest
universal
truth
is
something
so
simple
that
a
child
may
understand
this
surely
was
in
jesus
mind
when
he
said
thank
thee
o
father
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
because
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
babes
for
as
the
universe
is
one
so
the
individual
human
souls
that
apprehend
it
have
no
varying
values
intrinsically
but
one
equal
value
they
vary
but
in
power
to
apprehend
and
this
may
be
more
easily
hindered
than
helped
by
the
conceit
begotten
of
finite
knowledge
i
shall
even
dare
to
quote
of
this
universal
truth
the
words
i
once
hardily
put
into
the
mouth
of
john
wesley
concerning
divine
love
see
now
that
if
god
love
reach
up
to
every
star
and
down
to
every
poor
soul
on
earth
it
must
be
vastly
simple
so
simple
that
all
dwellers
on
earth
may
be
assured
of
it
as
all
who
have
eyes
may
be
assured
of
the
planet
shining
yonder
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
so
vast
that
all
bargaining
is
below
it
and
they
may
inherit
it
without
considering
their
deserts
i
believe
this
to
be
strictly
and
equally
true
of
the
appeal
which
poetry
makes
to
each
of
us
child
or
man
in
his
degree
as
johnson
said
of
gray
elegy
it
with
images
which
find
a
mirror
in
every
mind
and
with
sentiments
to
which
every
bosom
returns
an
echo
it
exalts
us
through
the
best
of
us
by
telling
us
something
new
yet
not
strange
something
that
we
something
that
we
too
have
known
or
surmised
but
had
never
the
delivering
speech
to
tell
is
a
pleasure
in
poetic
pains
says
wordsworth
but
gentlemen
if
you
have
never
felt
the
travail
yet
you
have
still
to
understand
the
bliss
of
deliverance
viii
if
then
you
consent
with
me
thus
far
in
theory
let
us
now
drive
at
practice
you
have
we
will
say
a
class
of
thirty
or
forty
in
front
of
you
we
will
assume
that
they
know
ab
can
at
least
spell
out
their
words
you
will
choose
a
passage
for
them
and
you
will
not
if
you
are
wise
choose
a
passage
from
paradise
lost
your
knowledge
telling
you
that
paradise
lost
was
written
late
in
his
life
by
a
great
and
older
men
of
whom
i
sad
to
say
am
one
assuring
you
that
to
taste
the
milton
of
paradise
lost
a
man
must
have
passed
his
thirtieth
year
you
take
the
early
milton
you
read
out
this
for
instance
from
haste
thee
nymph
and
bring
with
thee
jest
and
youthful
jollity
quips
and
cranks
and
wanton
wiles
nods
and
becks
and
wreathed
smiles
such
as
hang
on
hebe
cheek
and
love
to
live
in
dimple
sleek
sport
that
wrinkled
care
derides
and
laughter
holding
both
his
sides
go
on
just
read
it
to
them
they
wo
know
who
hebe
was
but
you
can
tell
them
later
the
metre
is
taking
hold
of
them
in
my
experience
the
metre
of
can
be
relied
upon
to
grip
children
and
anyway
they
can
see
holding
both
his
sides
they
recognise
it
as
if
they
saw
the
picture
go
on
steadily
come
and
trip
it
as
ye
go
on
the
light
fantastick
toe
and
in
thy
right
hand
lead
with
thee
the
mountain
nymph
sweet
liberty
and
if
i
give
thee
honour
due
mirth
admit
me
of
thy
crew
do
not
pause
and
explain
what
a
nymph
is
or
why
liberty
is
the
nymph
go
on
reading
the
prince
has
always
to
break
through
briers
to
kiss
the
sleeping
beauty
awake
go
on
with
the
incantation
calling
him
persuading
him
that
he
is
the
prince
and
she
is
worth
it
go
on
reading
mirth
admit
me
of
thy
crew
to
live
with
her
and
live
with
thee
in
unreprovéd
pleasures
free
to
hear
the
lark
begin
his
flight
and
singing
startle
the
dull
night
from
his
in
the
skies
till
the
dappled
dawn
doth
rise
at
this
point
still
as
you
read
without
stopping
to
explain
the
child
certainly
feels
that
he
is
being
led
to
something
he
knows
the
lark
but
the
lark
he
had
never
thought
of
that
and
dappled
that
just
now
he
comes
to
think
then
to
come
in
spite
of
sorrow
and
at
my
window
bid
through
the
or
the
vine
or
the
twisted
eglantine
while
the
cock
with
lively
din
scatters
the
rear
of
darkness
thin
and
to
the
stack
or
the
barn
door
stoutly
struts
his
dames
before
oft
listening
how
the
hounds
and
horn
cheerily
rouse
the
slumbering
morn
from
the
side
of
some
hoar
hill
through
the
high
wood
echoing
shrill
sometime
walking
not
unseen
by
hedgerow
elms
on
hillocks
green
right
against
the
eastern
gate
where
the
great
sun
begins
his
state
robed
in
flames
and
amber
light
the
clouds
in
thousand
liveries
dight
while
the
ploughman
near
at
hand
whistles
the
furrow
land
and
the
milkmaid
singeth
blithe
and
the
mower
whets
his
sithe
and
every
shepherd
tells
his
tale
under
the
hawthorn
in
the
dale
do
stop
i
say
to
explain
that
hebe
was
for
once
the
legitimate
daughter
of
zeus
and
as
such
had
the
privilege
to
draw
wine
for
the
gods
do
even
stop
just
yet
to
explain
who
the
gods
were
do
discourse
on
amber
otherwise
ambergris
do
explain
that
in
this
connexion
does
mean
do
trace
it
through
the
arabic
into
noah
ark
do
prove
its
electrical
properties
by
tearing
up
paper
into
little
bits
and
attracting
them
with
the
of
your
pipe
rubbed
on
your
sleeve
do
insist
philologically
that
when
every
shepherd
his
tale
he
is
not
relating
an
anecdote
but
simply
keeping
tally
of
his
flock
just
go
on
reading
as
well
as
you
can
and
be
sure
that
when
the
children
get
the
thrill
of
it
for
which
you
wait
they
will
be
asking
more
questions
and
pertinent
ones
than
you
are
able
to
answer
ix
this
advice
to
be
sure
presupposes
of
the
teacher
himself
some
capacity
of
reading
aloud
and
reading
aloud
is
not
taught
in
our
schools
in
our
elementary
schools
in
which
few
of
the
pupils
contemplate
being
called
to
holy
orders
or
to
the
bar
it
is
practised
indeed
but
seldom
taught
as
an
art
in
our
secondary
and
public
schools
it
is
neither
taught
nor
practised
as
i
know
to
my
cost
and
you
to
yours
gentlemen
on
whom
i
have
had
to
practise
but
let
the
teacher
take
courage
first
let
him
read
a
passage
the
long
breath
as
the
french
say
aloud
and
persuasively
as
he
can
now
and
then
he
may
pause
to
indicate
some
particular
beauty
repeating
the
line
before
he
proceeds
but
he
should
be
sparing
of
these
interruptions
when
laughter
for
example
is
already
both
his
sides
it
can
not
be
less
than
officious
a
work
of
supererogation
to
stop
and
hold
them
for
him
and
he
who
obeys
the
counsel
of
perfection
will
read
straight
to
the
end
and
then
recur
to
particular
beauties
next
let
him
put
up
a
child
to
continue
with
the
tale
and
another
and
another
just
as
in
a
construing
class
while
the
boy
is
reading
the
teacher
should
interrupt
he
should
wait
and
return
afterwards
upon
a
line
that
has
been
slurred
or
wrongly
emphasised
when
the
children
have
done
reading
he
should
invite
questions
on
any
point
they
have
found
puzzling
it
is
with
the
operation
of
poetry
on
minds
that
his
main
business
lies
lastly
he
may
run
back
over
significant
points
they
have
missed
is
that
all
the
method
that
is
all
the
method
simple
as
that
even
so
simple
as
that
and
i
claim
even
so
wise
seeing
that
it
just
lets
the
author
chaucer
or
shakespeare
or
milton
or
coleridge
have
his
own
way
with
the
young
plant
just
lets
them
drop
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
and
soak
in
the
moving
moon
went
up
the
sky
and
no
where
did
abide
softly
she
was
going
up
and
a
star
or
two
beside
do
you
really
want
to
chat
about
can
not
you
trust
it
the
stars
were
dim
and
thick
the
night
the
steersman
face
by
his
lamp
gleamed
white
from
the
sails
the
dew
did
drip
till
clomb
above
the
eastern
bar
the
hornéd
moon
with
one
bright
star
within
the
nether
tip
you
tell
them
that
for
the
moon
to
hold
a
star
anywhere
within
her
circumference
is
an
astronomical
impossibility
very
well
then
tell
it
but
tell
it
afterwards
and
put
it
away
quietly
for
the
quality
of
poetry
is
not
strained
let
the
rain
soak
then
use
your
hoe
and
gently
and
still
trust
nature
by
which
i
again
repeat
to
you
all
spirit
attracts
all
spirit
as
inevitably
as
all
matter
attracts
all
matter
i
am
glad
that
memory
flew
just
here
to
the
word
of
portia
for
it
carries
me
on
to
a
wise
page
of
dr
corson
and
a
passage
in
which
protesting
against
the
philologers
who
cram
our
children
handbooks
with
irrelevant
information
that
but
obscures
what
chaucer
or
shakespeare
he
breaks
out
in
chaucer
own
words
thise
cookes
how
they
stampe
and
streyne
and
grynde
and
turnen
substaunce
into
accident
yes
and
make
the
accident
the
substance
as
he
insists
that
the
true
subject
of
literary
study
is
the
author
meaning
and
the
true
method
a
surrender
of
the
mind
to
that
meaning
with
what
wordsworth
calls
wise
passiveness
the
eye
it
can
not
choose
but
see
we
can
not
bid
the
ear
be
still
our
bodies
feel
they
be
against
or
with
our
will
nor
less
i
deem
that
there
are
powers
which
of
themselves
our
minds
impress
that
we
can
feed
this
mind
of
ours
in
a
wise
passiveness
think
you
all
this
mighty
sum
of
things
for
ever
speaking
that
nothing
of
itself
will
come
but
we
must
still
be
seeking
x
i
have
been
talking
about
children
and
find
that
most
of
the
while
i
have
been
thinking
if
but
subconsciously
of
poor
children
now
at
the
end
you
may
ask
lecturing
here
at
cambridge
is
he
preoccupied
with
poor
children
who
leave
school
at
fourteen
and
under
and
thereafter
read
no
poetry
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
these
children
and
the
hopeless
wicked
waste
these
with
a
common
to
read
in
a
father
tired
after
his
day
work
and
for
parental
encouragement
just
the
two
words
out
a
scots
domine
writes
in
his
log
i
have
discovered
a
girl
with
a
sense
of
humour
i
asked
my
qualifying
class
to
draw
a
graph
of
the
attendance
at
a
village
kirk
you
must
explain
away
any
rise
or
fall
i
said
margaret
steel
had
a
huge
drop
one
sunday
and
her
explanation
was
collection
for
missions
next
sunday
the
congregation
was
abnormally
large
margaret
wrote
of
poor
margaret
when
she
is
fourteen
she
will
go
out
into
the
fields
and
in
three
years
she
will
be
an
ignorant
country
bumpkin
and
again
robert
campbell
a
favourite
pupil
left
the
school
he
had
reached
the
truly
it
is
like
death
i
stand
by
a
new
made
grave
and
i
have
no
hope
of
a
resurrection
robert
is
dead
precisely
because
i
have
lived
on
close
terms
with
this
and
the
wicked
waste
of
it
i
appeal
to
you
who
are
so
much
more
fortunate
than
this
robert
or
this
margaret
and
will
have
far
more
to
say
in
the
world
to
think
of
them
how
many
they
are
i
am
not
sentimentalising
when
an
elementary
schoolmaster
spreads
himself
and
tells
me
he
looks
upon
every
child
entering
his
school
as
a
potential
lord
chancellor
i
answer
that
as
i
expect
so
i
should
hope
to
die
before
seeing
the
world
a
woolsack
jack
can
not
ordinarily
be
as
good
as
his
master
if
he
were
he
would
be
a
great
deal
better
you
have
given
robert
a
vote
however
and
soon
you
will
have
to
give
it
to
margaret
can
you
not
give
them
also
in
their
short
years
at
school
something
to
sustain
their
souls
in
the
long
valley
of
humiliation
do
you
remember
this
passage
in
the
pilgrim
progress
as
the
pilgrims
passed
down
that
valley
now
as
they
were
going
along
and
talking
they
espied
a
boy
feeding
his
father
sheep
the
boy
was
in
very
mean
cloaths
but
of
a
very
fresh
and
countenance
and
as
he
sate
by
himself
he
sung
hark
said
mr
greatheart
to
what
the
shepherd
boy
saith
well
it
was
a
very
pretty
song
about
contentment
he
that
is
down
need
fear
no
fall
he
that
is
low
no
pride
he
that
is
humble
ever
shall
have
god
to
be
his
guide
but
i
care
less
for
its
subject
than
for
the
song
though
life
condemn
him
to
live
it
through
in
the
valley
of
humiliation
i
want
to
hear
the
shepherd
boy
singing

ff
lecture
v
on
reading
for
examinations
wednesday
may
i
you
gentlemen
who
so
far
have
followed
with
patience
this
course
of
lectures
advertised
maybe
too
ambitiously
as
the
art
of
reading
will
recall
to
your
memory
when
i
challenge
it
across
the
intervals
of
vacation
that
three
propositions
have
been
pretty
steadily
held
before
you
the
bear
me
out
that
man
life
being
of
the
length
it
is
and
his
activities
multifarious
as
they
are
out
of
the
mass
of
printed
matter
already
loaded
and
still
being
shot
upon
this
planet
he
make
selection
there
is
no
other
way
the
that
the
time
and
opportunity
being
so
brief
the
mass
so
enormous
and
the
selection
therefore
so
difficult
he
should
select
the
books
that
are
best
for
him
and
take
them
not
frittering
his
time
upon
books
written
about
and
around
the
best
that
in
their
order
of
course
the
primary
masterpieces
shall
come
first
and
the
secondary
second
and
so
on
and
mere
chat
about
any
of
them
last
of
all
my
proposition
perhaps
more
discutable
has
been
that
the
human
soul
activities
being
separated
so
far
as
we
can
separate
them
into
does
what
knows
what
to
a
man
ranks
higher
than
either
or
this
that
or
the
other
that
it
transcends
all
man
activity
upon
phenomena
even
a
napoleon
all
his
housed
store
of
knowledge
though
it
be
a
casaubon
or
a
mark
pattison
that
only
by
learning
to
can
we
understand
or
reach
as
we
have
an
instinct
to
reach
to
our
right
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
and
that
any
way
all
the
greatest
literature
commands
this
instinct
to
be
hamlet
to
feel
yourself
hamlet
is
more
important
than
killing
a
king
or
even
knowing
all
there
is
to
be
known
about
a
text
now
most
of
us
have
been
hamlet
more
or
less
while
few
of
us
i
trust
have
ever
murdered
a
monarch
and
still
fewer
perhaps
can
hope
to
know
all
that
is
to
be
known
of
the
text
of
the
play
but
for
value
gentlemen
let
us
not
rank
these
three
achievements
by
order
of
their
rarity
shakespeare
means
us
to
feel
to
hamlet
that
is
all
and
from
the
play
it
is
the
best
we
can
get
ii
now
in
talking
to
you
last
term
about
children
i
had
perforce
to
lay
stress
on
the
point
that
with
all
this
glut
of
literature
the
mass
of
children
in
our
commonwealth
who
leave
school
at
fourteen
go
forth
starving
but
you
are
happier
you
are
happier
not
in
having
your
selection
of
reading
in
english
done
for
you
at
school
for
you
have
in
the
public
schools
scarce
any
such
help
but
happier
because
the
time
of
learning
is
so
largely
prolonged
and
because
this
most
difficult
office
of
sorting
out
from
the
mass
what
you
should
read
as
most
profitable
has
been
tentatively
performed
for
you
by
us
older
men
for
your
relief
for
example
those
of
any
as
the
regulations
say
who
will
a
week
or
two
hence
be
sitting
for
section
a
of
the
medieval
and
modern
languages
tripos
have
been
spared
all
along
the
laborious
business
of
choosing
what
you
should
read
or
read
with
particular
attention
for
the
good
of
your
souls
is
chaucer
your
author
then
you
will
have
read
or
ought
to
have
read
the
parlement
of
fowls
the
prologue
to
the
canterbury
tales
the
tale
the
man
of
law
tale
the
nun
priest
tale
the
doctor
tale
the
pardoner
tale
with
its
prologue
the
friar
tale
you
were
not
dissuaded
from
reading
troilus
you
were
not
forbidden
to
read
all
the
canterbury
tales
even
the
naughtiest
but
the
works
that
i
have
mentioned
have
been
for
you
so
of
shakespeare
we
do
not
discourage
you
at
all
events
intentionally
from
reading
macbeth
othello
as
you
like
it
the
tempest
any
play
you
wish
in
other
years
we
each
of
these
in
its
turn
but
for
this
year
of
grace
we
insist
upon
king
john
the
merchant
of
venice
king
henry
iv
part
i
much
ado
about
nothing
hamlet
king
lear
specified
works
and
so
on
with
other
courses
of
study
why
is
this
done
be
fair
to
us
gentlemen
we
do
it
not
only
to
accommodate
the
burden
to
your
backs
to
avoid
overtaxing
or
two
years
of
study
not
merely
to
guide
you
that
you
do
not
dissipate
your
reading
that
you
shall
with
us
at
any
rate
know
where
you
are
we
do
it
chiefly
and
honestly
you
likewise
being
honest
to
give
you
each
year
in
each
prescribed
course
a
sound
nucleus
of
knowledge
out
of
which
later
your
minds
can
reach
to
more
we
are
not
in
the
last
instance
praiseworthy
or
blameworthy
for
your
range
i
think
perhaps
too
little
of
a
man
in
his
short
while
here
between
say
nineteen
and
for
anything
i
care
the
kernel
may
be
as
small
as
you
please
to
plant
it
wholesome
for
a
while
to
tend
it
wholesome
then
to
show
it
the
sky
and
that
it
is
wide
not
a
nor
a
brassy
cupola
over
a
man
but
an
atmosphere
shining
up
league
on
league
to
reach
the
moment
of
saying
this
now
is
yours
if
you
have
the
perseverance
as
i
have
taught
you
the
power
nactus
es
hoc
this
even
in
our
present
tripos
we
endeavour
to
do
iii
all
very
well
but
as
elizabeth
barrett
browning
asked
do
ye
hear
the
children
weeping
o
my
brothers
i
hear
you
ingeminate
what
about
examinations
we
thank
you
sirs
for
thus
relieving
and
guiding
us
we
acknowledge
your
excellent
intentions
but
in
practice
you
hang
up
a
bachelor
gown
and
hood
on
a
pole
and
right
under
and
just
in
front
of
it
you
set
the
for
this
in
practice
we
run
during
three
years
or
so
and
to
this
all
the
time
you
are
exhorting
directing
us
whether
you
mean
it
or
not
though
we
suspect
that
you
can
not
help
yourselves
yes
and
as
labouring
swimmers
will
turn
their
eyes
even
to
a
little
boat
in
the
offing
i
hear
you
pant
man
at
all
events
always
so
insistent
that
good
literature
teaches
rather
than
will
bring
word
that
we
may
float
on
our
backs
bathe
enjoy
these
waters
and
be
refreshed
instead
of
striving
through
them
competitive
for
a
goal
he
condemn
literary
examinations
of
which
treat
literature
as
matter
of
knowledge
merely
iv
i
am
sorry
gentlemen
i
can
not
bring
you
so
much
of
comfort
as
all
that
i
have
a
love
of
the
past
which
because
it
goes
down
to
the
roots
has
sometimes
been
called
radicalism
i
could
never
consent
with
bacon
gibe
at
antiquity
as
augurium
and
examinations
have
a
very
respectable
antiquity
indeed
no
university
to
my
knowledge
has
ever
been
able
in
the
long
run
to
do
without
them
and
although
certain
colleges
king
college
here
and
new
college
at
oxford
for
long
persevered
in
the
attempt
the
result
was
not
altogether
happy
and
in
the
end
they
have
consigned
with
custom
of
course
universities
have
experimented
with
the
let
me
give
you
two
or
three
ancient
examples
which
may
help
you
to
see
to
vary
wordsworth
that
though
form
decays
the
function
never
dies
i
begin
with
most
ancient
bologna
famous
for
civil
law
at
bologna
the
process
of
graduation
of
admission
to
the
docendi
to
teach
consisted
of
two
parts
the
private
examination
and
the
public
the
private
examination
was
the
real
test
of
competence
the
public
examination
being
in
practice
a
mere
ceremony
before
admission
to
each
of
these
tests
the
candidate
was
presented
by
the
consiliarius
of
his
nation
to
the
rector
for
permission
to
enter
it
and
swore
that
he
had
complied
with
all
the
statutable
conditions
that
he
would
give
no
more
than
the
statutable
fees
or
entertainments
to
the
rector
himself
the
doctor
or
his
and
that
he
would
obey
the
rector
within
a
period
of
eight
days
before
the
examination
the
candidate
was
presented
by
own
doctor
or
by
some
other
doctor
or
by
two
doctors
to
the
archdeacon
the
presenting
doctor
being
required
to
have
satisfied
himself
by
private
examination
of
his
presentee
fitness
early
on
the
morning
of
the
examination
after
attending
a
mass
of
the
holy
ghost
the
candidate
appeared
before
the
assembled
college
and
was
assigned
by
one
of
the
doctors
present
two
passages
in
the
civil
or
canon
law
as
the
case
might
be
he
then
retired
to
his
house
to
study
the
passages
in
doing
which
it
would
appear
that
he
had
the
assistance
of
the
presenting
doctor
later
in
the
day
the
doctors
were
summoned
to
the
cathedral
or
some
other
public
building
by
the
archdeacon
who
presided
over
but
took
no
active
part
in
the
ensuing
examination
the
candidate
was
then
introduced
to
the
archdeacon
and
doctors
by
the
presenting
doctor
or
promotor
as
he
was
styled
the
prior
of
the
college
then
administered
a
number
of
oaths
in
which
the
candidate
promised
respect
to
that
body
and
solemnly
renounced
all
the
rights
of
which
the
college
had
succeeded
in
robbing
all
doctors
of
other
colleges
not
included
in
its
ranks
the
candidate
then
gave
a
lecture
or
exposition
of
the
two
prepared
passages
after
which
he
was
examined
upon
them
by
two
of
the
doctors
appointed
by
the
college
other
doctors
might
ask
supplementary
questions
of
law
which
they
were
required
to
swear
that
they
had
not
previously
communicated
to
the
candidate
arising
more
indirectly
out
of
the
passages
selected
or
might
suggest
objections
to
the
answers
with
a
tender
regard
for
the
feelings
of
their
comrades
at
this
and
tremendous
examination
as
they
style
it
the
statutes
required
the
examiner
to
treat
the
examinee
as
own
but
knowing
what
we
do
of
parental
discipline
in
the
middle
ages
we
need
not
take
this
to
enjoin
a
weak
excess
of
leniency
the
examination
concluded
the
votes
of
the
doctors
present
were
taken
by
ballot
and
the
candidate
fate
determined
by
the
majority
the
decision
being
announced
by
the
archdeacon
let
us
pass
to
the
great
and
famous
university
of
paris
at
paris
in
if
not
earlier
a
preliminary
test
or
was
instituted
to
ascertain
the
fitness
of
those
who
wanted
to
take
part
in
the
public
performance
at
these
which
took
place
in
the
december
before
the
lent
in
which
the
candidate
was
to
determine
he
had
to
dispute
in
grammar
and
logic
with
a
master
if
this
test
was
passed
in
a
satisfactory
manner
the
candidate
was
admitted
to
the
baccalariandorum
examination
for
the
baccalaureate
which
was
conducted
by
a
board
of
examiners
appointed
by
each
nation
for
its
own
candidates
the
duty
of
the
examiners
was
twofold
firstly
to
ascertain
by
inspecting
the
given
by
his
masters
that
the
candidate
had
completed
the
necessary
residence
and
attended
lectures
in
the
prescribed
subjects
and
secondly
to
examine
him
in
the
contents
of
his
books
if
he
passed
this
examination
he
was
admitted
to
determine
determination
was
a
great
day
in
the
student
university
life
it
retained
much
of
its
primitive
character
of
a
student
festivity
it
was
not
it
would
seem
till
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
that
the
student
master
was
required
to
be
officially
present
at
it
the
of
a
public
school
if
combined
with
considerably
more
than
the
license
of
the
oxford
encaenia
or
degree
day
here
in
may
week
would
perhaps
be
the
nearest
modern
equivalent
of
these
medieval
exhibitions
of
rising
talent
every
effort
was
made
to
attract
to
the
schools
as
large
an
audience
as
possible
not
merely
of
masters
or
but
if
possible
of
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
and
other
distinguished
persons
the
friends
of
a
determiner
who
was
not
successful
in
drawing
a
more
distinguished
audience
would
run
out
into
the
streets
and
forcibly
drag
chance
into
the
school
wine
was
provided
at
the
determiner
expense
in
the

the
day
ended
in
a
feast
given
in
imitation
of
the
even
if
dancing
or
processions
were
forborne
in
deference
to
authority
i
may
add
here
in
parenthesis
that
the
thirstiness
always
so
remarkable
in
the
medieval
man
whether
it
make
him
strange
to
you
or
help
to
ingratiate
him
as
a
human
brother
seems
to
have
followed
him
even
into
the
tripos
was
not
only
after
a
university
exercise
says
the
historian
rashdall
vol
ii
during
its
progress
that
the
need
of
refreshment
was
apt
to
be
felt
many
statutes
allude
some
by
way
of
prohibition
but
not
always
to
the
custom
of
providing
wine
for
the
examiners
or
temptator
good
word
before
during
or
after
the
examination
at
heidelberg
the
dean
of
the
faculty
might
order
in
drinks
the
candidate
not
at
leipsic
the
candidate
is
forbidden
to
treat
the
examiners
the
examination
which
seems
sound
at
vienna
medical
school
he
is
required
to
spend
a
florin
v
now
when
we
come
to
england
that
is
to
oxford
and
cambridge
which
ever
had
queer
ways
of
their
own
we
find
strange
to
say
for
centuries
no
evidence
at
all
of
any
kind
of
examination
as
for
examinations
like
the
defunct
mathematical
and
classical
triposes
here
with
senior
wranglers
wooden
spoons
and
what
lay
between
of
all
european
universities
louvain
alone
used
the
system
and
may
have
invented
it
at
louvain
the
candidates
for
the
mastership
were
placed
in
three
classes
in
each
of
which
the
names
were
arranged
in
order
of
merit
the
first
class
were
styled
the
second
the
third
while
a
fourth
class
not
publicly
announced
contained
the
names
of
those
who
could
not
be
passed
on
any
terms
autem

says
the
statute
inveniantur

competitive
examinations
i
proceed
in
the
historian
words
largely
to
raise
louvain
to
the
high
position
as
a
place
of
learning
and
education
which
it
retained
before
the
universities
were
roused
from
their
century
torpor
by
the
revival
of
learning
pope
adrian
vi
was
one
of
its
famous
and
jansen
another
the
college
which
produced
a
enjoyed
three
days
holiday
during
which
its
bell
was
rung
continuously
day
and
night
at
oxford
and
cambridge
i
repeat
we
find
in
their
early
days
no
trace
of
any
examination
at
all
to
be
sure
and
as
perhaps
you
know
the
first
archives
of
this
university
were
burned
in
the
and
gown
riots
of
by
the
townsmen
whose
descendants
erasmus
describes
genially
as
the
utmost
rusticity
with
the
utmost
malevolence
but
no
student
will
doubt
that
cambridge
used
pretty
much
the
same
system
as
oxford
and
the
system
was
this
when
a
candidate
presented
himself
before
the
chancellor
for
a
license
in
arts
he
had
to
swear
that
he
had
heard
certain
books
and
nine
regent
masters
besides
his
own
master
who
presented
him
were
required
to
depose
to
their
knowledge
of
his
sufficiency
and
five
others
to
their
credence
says
the
statute
only
in
the
school
of
theology
was
no
room
allowed
to
credulity
there
all
the
masters
had
to
depose
their
knowledge
and
one
black
ball
excluded
vi
well
you
may
urge
that
this
method
has
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
it
i
will
go
some
way
to
meet
you
too
but
first
you
must
pay
me
the
compliment
of
supposing
me
a
just
man
being
a
just
man
and
there
also
being
presumed
in
me
some
acquaintance
with
english
literature
not
indeed
much
not
necessarily
much
but
enough
to
distinguish
good
writing
from
bad
or
at
any
rate
real
writing
from
sham
and
at
least
to
have
an
inkling
of
what
these
poets
and
were
trying
to
do
why
then
i
declare
to
you
that
after
two
years
reading
with
a
man
and
talk
with
him
about
literature
i
should
have
a
far
better
sense
of
his
industry
of
his
capacity
of
his
performance
and
better
of
his
promise
than
any
examination
is
likely
to
yield
me
in
short
i
could
sign
him
up
for
a
first
second
or
third
class
or
as
with
more
accuracy
and
confidence
than
i
could
derive
from
taking
him
as
a
stranger
and
pondering
his
three
or
four
days
performance
in
a
tripos
for
some
of
the
best
men
mature
slowly
and
some
if
not
most
of
the
best
writers
write
slowly
because
they
have
a
conscience
and
the
most
original
minds
are
just
those
for
whom
in
a
examination
it
is
hardest
to
set
a
paper
but
the
process
you
will
admit
might
be
invidious
might
lend
itself
to
misunderstanding
might
conceivably
even
lead
to
of
an
oath
forbidding
the
use
of
a
knife
or
other
sharp
implement
and
among
colleges
rivalry
is
not
altogether
unknown
and
dons
if
unlike
other
men
in
outward
aspect
sometimes
resemble
them
in
frailty
and
in
short
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
to
stick
to
the
old
system
for
a
while
longer
i
am
sorry
gentlemen
but
you
see
how
it
works
vii
yet
and
i
admit
it
the
main
objection
abides
that
while
literature
deals
with
rather
than
with
knows
examinations
by
their
very
nature
test
mere
knowledge
rather
than
anything
else
that
in
the
hands
of
a
examiner
they
tend
to
test
knowledge
alone
or
what
passes
for
knowledge
and
that
in
the
very
run
of
this
world
most
examiners
will
be
men
which
if
we
remind
ourselves
that
they
receive
the
pay
of
ones
is
after
all
considerably
better
than
we
have
a
right
to
expect
we
are
dealing
mind
you
with
literature
our
own
literature
in
examining
upon
a
foreign
literature
we
can
artfully
lay
our
stress
upon
knowledge
and
yet
neither
raise
nor
risk
raising
the
fatal
questions
is
it
all
is
it
and
why
is
it
merely
to
translate
literally
a
chorus
of
the
agamemnon
or
an
ode
of
pindar
or
a
passage
from
dante
or
molière
is
a
creditable
performance
to
translate
either
well
is
a
considerable
feat
and
to
translate
either
perfectly
is
what
you
ca
do
and
the
examiner
knows
you
do
and
you
know
the
examiner
ca
do
and
the
examiner
knows
you
know
he
ca
do
but
when
we
come
to
a
fine
thing
in
our
own
language
to
a
stanza
from
shelley
adonais
for
instance
he
has
outsoared
the
shadow
of
our
night
envy
and
calumny
and
hate
and
pain
and
that
unrest
which
men
miscall
delight
can
touch
him
not
and
torture
not
again
from
the
contagion
of
the
world
slow
stain
he
is
secure
and
now
can
never
mourn
a
heart
grown
cold
a
head
grown
gray
in
vain
nor
when
the
spirit
self
has
ceased
to
burn
with
sparkless
ashes
load
an
unlamented
urn
what
can
you
do
with
how
can
you
examine
on
well
yes
you
can
request
the
candidate
to
a
short
note
on
the
word
above
or
ask
what
is
it
derived
does
he
know
of
blackwood
magazine
he
quote
any
parallel
allusion
in
byron
you
can
ask
all
that
but
you
are
not
getting
within
measurable
distance
of
your
mind
is
not
even
moving
on
the
right
plane
or
let
me
turn
back
to
some
light
and
artless
elizabethan
thing
say
to
the
oenone
duet
in
arraignment
of
paris

and
twice
so
fair
as
fair
as

how
can
anyone
examine
on
how
can
anyone
solemnly
explain
in
a
hurry
answering
one
of
five
or
six
questions
selected
from
a
three
hours
paper
just
why
and
how
that
hits
him
and
yet
if
it
hit
him
not
he
is
lost
if
even
so
simple
a
thing
as
that
a
thing
of
silly
sooth
do
not
hit
him
he
is
all
unfit
to
traffic
with
literature
viii
you
see
how
delicate
a
business
it
is
examination
in
literature
being
by
its
very
nature
so
closely
tied
down
to
be
a
test
of
can
hardly
save
when
used
by
genius
with
care
be
any
final
test
of
that
which
is
better
than
knowledge
of
that
which
is
the
crown
of
all
scholarship
of
but
do
not
therefore
lose
heart
even
in
your
reading
for
strict
purposes
of
examination
our
talk
is
of
reading
let
me
fetch
you
some
comfort
from
the
sister
and
correlative
but
harder
art
of
writing
i
most
potently
believe
that
the
very
best
writing
in
verse
or
in
prose
can
only
be
produced
in
moments
of
high
excitement
or
rather
as
i
should
put
it
in
those
moments
of
still
and
solemn
awe
into
which
a
noble
excitement
lifts
a
man
let
me
speak
only
of
prose
of
which
you
may
more
cautiously
allow
this
than
of
verse
i
think
of
st
paul
glorious
passage
as
rendered
in
the
authorised
version
concluding
the
chapter
of
his
first
epistle
to
the
corinthians
first
as
you
know
comes
the
long
swaying
scholastic
somewhat
sophisticated
argument
about
the
evidence
of
resurrection
about
the
corn
which
thou
sowest
the
vivification
the
change
in
vivification
and
the
rest
all
this
almost
purely
argumentative
should
be
read
quietly
with
none
of
the
which
your
prize
reader
lavishes
on
it
the
argument
works
up
quietly
at
once
tensely
and
sinuously
but
very
quietly
to
conviction
then
comes
the
hush
and
then
the
authoritative
voice
speaking
out
of
it
awful
and
slow
i
shew
you
a
mystery
and
then
all
the
latent
emotion
of
faith
taking
hold
and
lifting
the
man
on
its
surge
the
trumpet
shall
sound
and
the
dead
shall
be
raised
incorruptible
and
so
incorruption
tolling
down
corruption
the
trumpet
smashes
death
underfoot
in
victory
until
out
of
the
midst
of
tumult
sounds
the
recall
sober
measured
claiming
the
purified
heart
back
to
discipline
my
beloved
brethren
be
ye
stedfast
unmoveable
always
abounding
in
the
work
of
the
lord
forasmuch
as
ye
know
that
your
labour
is
not
in
vain
in
the
lord
i
think
of
that
triumphant
passage
i
think
of
the
sentences
with
which
isaak
walton
ends
his
life
of
donne
i
think
of
the
last
pages
of
motley
dutch
republic
with
its
eulogy
on
william
the
silent
so
exquisitely
closing
as
long
as
he
lived
he
was
the
of
a
whole
brave
nation
and
when
he
died
the
little
children
cried
in
the
streets
i
think
of
two
great
prose
passages
in
thackeray
esmond
of
landor
dream
of
boccaccio
and
so
on
and
i
am
sure
that
in
prose
or
in
verse
the
best
that
man
can
utter
flows
from
him
either
in
moments
of
high
mental
excitement
or
in
the
hush
of
that
to
which
high
excitement
lifts
him
but
first
now
observe
how
all
these
passages
and
they
are
the
first
i
call
to
mind
rise
like
crests
on
a
large
bulk
of
a
wave
st
paul
on
a
labouring
argument
about
immortality
at
the
conclusion
of
a
heavy
task
long
campaigning
brings
the
reward
of
harry
esmond
return
to
castlewood
long
intrigue
of
the
author
mind
with
his
characters
closes
that
febrile
chapter
in
which
harry
walks
home
to
break
the
news
of
the
death
of
the
duke
of
hamilton
in
the
early
morning
through
kensington
where
the
newsboys
are
already
shouting
it
the
world
was
going
to
its
business
again
although
dukes
lay
dead
and
ladies
mourned
for
them
so
day
and
night
pass
away
and
comes
and
our
place
knows
us
not
esmond
thought
of
the
courier
now
galloping
on
the
north
road
to
inform
him
who
was
earl
of
arran
yesterday
that
he
was
duke
of
hamilton
and
of
a
thousand
great
schemes
hopes
ambitions
that
were
alive
in
the
gallant
heart
beating
but
a
few
hours
since
and
now
in
a
little
dust
quiescent
and
on
top
of
this
let
me
assure
you
that
in
writing
or
learning
to
write
solid
daily
practice
is
the
prescription
and
upon
inspiration
a
lure
these
crests
only
rise
on
the
back
of
constant
labour
nine
days
according
to
homer
leto
travailed
with
apollo
but
he
was
apollo
lord
of
song
i
this
to
be
true
of
ordinary
talent
but
supposing
you
all
to
be
geniuses
i
am
almost
as
sure
that
it
holds
of
genius
listen
to
this
napoleon
i
used
to
say
that
battles
were
won
by
the
sudden
flashing
of
an
idea
through
the
brain
of
a
commander
at
a
certain
critical
instant
the
capacity
for
generating
this
sudden
electric
spark
was
military
genius
napoleon
seems
always
to
have
counted
upon
it
always
to
have
believed
that
when
the
critical
moment
arrived
the
wild
confusion
of
the
battlefield
would
be
illuminated
for
him
by
that
burst
of
sudden
flame
but
if
napoleon
had
been
ignorant
of
the
prosaic
business
of
his
profession
which
he
attended
more
closely
than
any
other
commander
would
these
moments
of
supreme
clearness
have
availed
him
or
would
they
have
come
to
him
at
all
my
author
thinks
not
and
i
am
sure
he
is
right
so
in
writing
only
out
of
long
preparation
can
come
the
truly
triumphant
flash
and
i
ask
you
to
push
this
analogy
further
into
the
business
of
reading
even
of
reading
for
examination
you
learn
to
discipline
yourselves
you
acquire
the
art
of
marshalling
of
concentrating
driving
your
knowledge
upon
a
point
and
for
you
are
young
that
point
is
by
no
means
the
final
point
say
that
it
is
only
an
examination
and
silly
at
that
still
you
have
been
learning
the
art
you
have
been
training
yourself
to
be
for
a
better
purpose
effective
ix
yet
and
when
this
has
been
granted
the
crucial
question
abides
and
i
must
not
shirk
it
say
that
the
highest
literature
deals
with
rather
than
with
it
is
all
very
fine
to
assure
us
that
testing
our
knowledge
literature
and
literature
and
on
this
side
or
that
side
of
literature
is
healthy
for
us
in
some
oblique
way
but
can
you
examiners
examine
or
can
you
not
on
literature
in
what
you
call
its
own
and
proper
category
of
so
i
hear
the
question
the
question
which
beats
and
has
beaten
over
and
over
again
good
men
trying
to
construct
schools
of
english
in
our
universities
with
all
sense
of
a
responsibility
of
a
difficulty
that
has
lain
on
my
mind
for
these
five
years
i
answer
gentlemen
we
ought
yes
we
can
and
yes
we
will
but
for
the
achievement
we
teachers
must
first
know
how
to
teach
when
that
is
learned
examination
will
come
as
a
consequent
easy
almost
trivial
matter
i
will
for
example
having
already
allowed
how
it
is
to
examine
on
literature
take
the
difficulty
at
its
very
extreme
i
will
select
a
piece
of
poetry
and
the
poet
shall
be
keats
on
whom
if
on
any
one
is
felt
the
temptation
to
write
gush
and
loose
aesthetic
chatter
a
pupil
comes
to
read
with
me
and
i
open
at
the
famous
ode
to
a
grecian
urn
we
read
it
through
together
perhaps
twice
at
the
second
attempt
getting
the
emphasis
right
and
some
at
any
rate
of
the
modulations
of
voice
so
we
reach
a
working
idea
of
the
ode
and
what
keats
meant
it
to
be
we
then
compare
it
with
his
other
odes
and
observe
that
it
is
a
regular
in
stanza
form
b
in
spite
of
its
outburst
in
the
stanza
happy
love
more
happy
happy
love
much
severer
in
tone
than
the
ode
to
a
nightingale
or
the
ode
to
psyche
c
that
the
emotion
is
not
luscious
but
simple
d
that
this
simplicity
is
hellenic
so
far
as
keats
can
compass
it
and
e
eminently
to
its
subject
which
is
a
carven
urn
gracious
but
severe
of
outline
a
moment
of
joy
caught
by
the
sculptor
and
arrested
for
time
to
perpetuate
yet
and
this
is
the
point
of
the
ode
conveying
a
sense
that
innocent
gaiety
is
not
only
its
own
excuse
but
of
human
things
one
of
the
few
eternal
and
eternal
just
because
it
is
joyous
and
fleeting
then
we
go
back
and
compare
this
kind
of
quiet
immortal
beauty
with
the
passionate
immortality
hymned
in
the
nightingale
ode
thou
wast
not
born
for
death
immortal
bird
no
hungry
generations
tread
thee
down
with
all
the
rest
of
that
supreme
stanza
from
which
with
some
passages
my
reading
supplies
to
illustrate
the
difference
we
fall
to
contrasting
the
vibrating
thrill
of
the
nightingale
with
the
happy
grace
of
the
grecian
urn
and
allowing
each
to
be
appropriate
dispute
for
a
while
perhaps
over
the
merits
of
classical
calm
and
romantic
thrill
from
this
we
proceed
to
examine
the
ode
in
detail
line
by
line
which
examination
brings
up
a
whole
crowd
of
questions
such
as
a
we
have
a
thought
enounced
in
the
first
stanza
does
the
ode
go
on
to
develop
and
amplify
it
as
an
ode
should
or
does
pegasus
come
down
again
and
again
on
the
prints
from
which
he
took
off
if
he
do
this
and
the
action
of
the
ode
be
dead
and
unprogressive
is
the
defect
covered
by
beauty
of
language
can
such
defect
ever
be
so
covered
b
lines
and
anticipate
lines
which
are
saying
the
same
thing
and
getting
no
forwarder
c
we
come
to
the
lines
what
little
town
by
river
or
sea
shore
or
with
peaceful
citadel
is
emptied
of
this
folk
this
pious
morn
with
the
answering
lines
and
little
town
thy
streets
for
evermore
will
silent
be
and
not
a
soul
to
tell
why
thou
art
desolate
can
return
and
we
note
sir
sidney
colvin
suggestion
that
this
breaks
in
upon
an
arrest
of
art
as
though
it
were
an
arrest
on
reality
and
remember
that
he
raised
a
somewhat
similar
question
over
the
nightingale
and
comparing
them
discuss
truth
of
emotion
against
truth
of
reality
we
come
to
the
last
stanza
and
lament
attic
shape
fair
attitude
for
its
jingle
but
note
how
the
poet
recovers
himself
and
brings
the
whole
to
a
grand
close
i
have
even
yet
mentioned
but
a
few
of
the
points
for
one
i
have
omitted
its
most
beautiful
on
which
teacher
and
pupil
can
dwell
and
learn
together
and
heaven
forbid
that
as
a
teacher
i
should
even
on
half
of
those
i
have
indicated
a
teacher
as
i
hold
should
watch
for
what
his
pupil
divines
of
his
own
accord
but
if
trafficking
with
works
of
inspiration
he
have
no
gift
to
catch
that
inspiration
nor
power
to
pass
it
on
then
i
say
help
him
but
he
has
no
valid
right
on
earth
to
be
in
the
business
and
if
a
teacher
have
all
these
chances
of
teaching
mind
you
of
teaching
supplied
him
by
a
single
ode
of
keats
do
you
suppose
we
can
not
set
in
an
examination
paper
one
intelligent
question
upon
it
in
its
own
lawful
category
gentlemen
with
the
most
scrupulous
tenderness
for
aged
and
even
decrepit
interests
we
have
been
trying
to
liberate
you
from
certain
old
bad
superstitions
and
silently
laying
the
stones
of
a
new
school
of
english
which
we
believe
to
be
worthy
even
of
cambridge
our
proposals
are
before
the
university
should
they
be
passed
still
everything
will
depend
on
the
loyalty
of
its
teachers
to
the
idea
and
on
that
enthusiasm
which
i
suppose
to
be
the
nurse
of
all
studies
and
know
to
be
the
authentic
cherishing
nurse
of
ours
we
may
even
have
conceded
too
much
to
the
letter
but
we
have
built
and
built
our
trust
on
the
spirit

feeling
as
they
say
of

offenders
my
position
acutely
i
had
the
honour
of
reading
an
inaugural
before
this
university
and
the
impudence
to
loose
in
the
course
of
it
a
light
shaft
against
a
phrase
in
the
very
ordinance
defining
the
duties
of
this
chair
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
professor
says
the
ordinance
deliver
courses
of
lectures
on
english
literature
from
the
age
of
chaucer
onwards
and
otherwise
to
promote
so
far
as
may
be
in
his
power
the
study
in
the
university
of
the
subject
of
english
literature
that
was
the
phrase
at
which
i
glanced
subject
of
english
literature
and
i
propose
that
we
start
for
reasons
that
will
appear
by
subjecting
this
subject
to
some
examination
ii
of
english
literature
surely
for
a
start
there
is
no
such
thing
or
rather
may
we
not
say
that
everything
is
has
been
or
can
be
a
subject
of
english
literature
man
loss
of
paradise
has
been
a
subject
of
english
literature
and
so
has
been
a
copper
coinage
in
ireland
and
so
has
been
roast
and
so
has
been
holy

and
so
has
been

unholy

and
so
have
been

the
wealth
of

the
sublime
and
the
beautiful
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
grecian
urns
modern
painters
intimations
of
immortality
in
early
childhood
travels
with
a
donkey
rural
rides
and
rejected
addresses
these
have
been
subjects
of
english
literature
as
have
been
human
complots
and
intrigues
as
wide
asunder
as
othello
and
the
school
for
scandal
persons
as
different
as
prometheus
and
dr
johnson
imogen
and
moll
flanders
piers
the
plowman
and
mr
pickwick
places
as
different
as
utopia
and
cranford
laputa
and
reading

is
literature
but
so
is
a
tale
of
a
tub
listen
for
this
is
literature
if
some
king
of
the
earth
have
so
large
an
extent
of
dominion
in
north
and
south
so
that
he
hath
winter

together
in
his

so

he
brought

not
out
of
a
lesser

he
can
bring
thy
summer
out
of
winter
though
thou
have
no
spring
though
in
the
ways
of
fortune
or
understanding
or
conscience
thou
have
been
benighted
till
now
wintered
and
frozen
clouded
and
eclipsed

and
benumbed

and
stupefied

now
now
god
comes
to
thee
not
as
in
the
dawning
of
the
day
not
as
in
the
bud
of
the
spring
but
as
the
sun
at
noon
to
illustrate
all
shadows
as
the
sheaves
in
harvest
to
fill
all
penuries
all
occasions
invite
his
mercies
and
all
times
are
his
seasons
but
listen
again
for
this
also
is
literature
a
sweet
disorder
in
the
dress
kindles
in
clothes
a
wantonness
a
lawn
about
the
shoulders
thrown
into
a
fine
distraction
an
erring
lace
which
here
and
there
enthrals
the
crimson
stomacher
a
cuff
neglectful
and
thereby
ribbons
to
flow
confusedly
a
winning
wave
deserving
note
in
the
tempestuous
petticoat
a
careless
in
whose
tie
i
see
a
wild
civility
do
more
bewitch
me
than
when
art
is
too
precise
in
every
part
here
again
is
literature
when
i
was
a
child
at
seven
years
old
my
friends
on
a
holiday
filled
my
pockets
with
coppers
i
went
directly
to
a
shop
where
they
sold
toys
for
children
and
being
charmed
with
the
sound
of
a
whistle
that
i
met
by
the
way
in
the
hands
of
another
boy
i
voluntarily
offered
him
all
my
money
for
one
i
then
came
home
and
went
whistling
all
over
the
house
much
pleased
with
my
whistle
but
disturbing
all
the
family
my
brothers
and
sisters
and
cousins
understanding
the
bargain
i
had
made
told
me
i
had
given
four
times
as
much
for
it
as
it
was
worth
the
reflection
gave
me
more
chagrin
than
the
whistle
gave
me
pleasure

so
also

tell

where

this
is

and

place
from
the

from
the
tempest
as
rivers
of

place
as
the
shadow
of
a

land
but
so
is
this

circle
can
not
touch
another

points
than
one
for
if
it
be
possible
let

touch

the

falls

whatsoever
in
short
engages
man
activity
of
soul
or
body
may
be
deemed
the
subject
of
literature
and
is
transformed
into
literature
by
process
of
recording
it
in
memorable
speech
it
is
so
it
has
been
so
and
god
forbid
it
should
ever
not
be
so
iii
now
this
put
so
is
you
will
say
so
extremely
obvious
that
it
must
needs
hide
a
fallacy
or
at
best
a
quibble
on
a
word
i
shall
try
to
show
that
it
does
not
that
it
directly
opposes
plain
truth
to
a
convention
accepted
by
the
ordinance
and
that
the
fallacy
lies
in
that
convention
a
convention
may
be
defined
as
something
which
a
number
of
men
have
agreed
to
accept
in
lieu
of
the
truth
and
to
pass
off
for
the
truth
upon
others
i
was
about
to
add
preferably
when
they
can
catch
them
young
but
some
recent
travel
in
railway
trains
and
listening
to
the
kind
of
stuff
men
of
mature
years
deliver
straight
out
of
newspapers
for
the
products
of
their
own
digested
thought
have
persuaded
me
that
the
ordinary
man
is
as
susceptible
at
fifty
sixty
or
even
seventy
as
at
any
earlier
period
of
growth
and
that
the
process
of
incubation
is
scarcely
less
rapid
i
am
not
to
be
sure
concerned
to
deny
that
there
may
be
conventions
useful
enough
to
society
serving
it
to
maintain
government
order
public
and
private
decency
or
the
commerce
on
which
it
must
needs
rest
to
be
a
civilised
society
at
all
commerce
of
food
commerce
of
clothing
and
so
on
up
to
commerce
in
knowledge
and
ideas
government
itself
any
form
of
it
is
a
convention
marriage
is
a
convention
money
of
course
is
a
convention
and
the
alphabet
itself
i
suppose
to
contain
as
many
conventions
as
all
the
old
courts
of
love
and
laws
of
chivalry
put
together
and
our
english
alphabet
one
tremendous
fallacy
that
letters
separately
or
in
combination
are
capable
of
symbolising
all
the
sounds
produced
by
an
englishman
organs
of
speech
let
alone
the
sounds
he
hears
from
foreigners
dogs
guns
and
other
friends
and
enemies
to
whom
we
deny
the
franchise
also
of
course
it
ignores
the
whole
system
of
musical
notes
another
convention
which
yet
with
many
of
the
older
bards
could
hardly
be
separated
from
the
words
they
used
though
now
only
the
words
survive
and
as
literature
iv
but
every
convention
has
a
fallacy
somewhere
at
the
root
whether
it
be
useful
and
operative
as
many
a
legal
fiction
is
operative
for
good
or
senile
past
service
yet
tyrannous
by
custom
and
so
pernicious
or
merely
foolish
as
certain
artistic
conventions
are
traceable
when
a
ruskin
comes
to
judgment
back
to
nothing
better
than
folly
and
it
becomes
men
of
honest
mind
in
dealing
with
anything
recognisable
as
a
convention
to
examine
its
accepted
fallacy
whether
it
be
well
understood
or
ill
understood
beneficent
or
pernicious
or
merely
foolish
or
both
foolish
and
pernicious
and
this
is
often
most
handily
done
by
tracing
its
history
now
i
shall
assume
that
the
framers
of
the
ordinance
regulating
the
duties
of
this
chair
knew
well
enough
of
their
own
reading
that
english
literature
deals
with
a
vast
variety
of
subjects
and
that
if
any
piece
of
writing
miss
to
deal
with
its
particular
subject
so
closely
that
theme
and
treatment
can
scarcely
be
separated
by
so
much
will
it
be
faulty
as
literature
milton
is
fairly
possessed
with
the
story
of
man
fall
boswell
possessed
with
johnson
shelley
with
hatred
of
tyranny
in
all
its
manifestations
mill
again
with
the
idea
of
liberty
and
it
is
only
because
we
had
knowledge
presented
to
us
at
an
age
when
we
thought
more
attentively
of
apples
that
we
still
fail
to
recognise
in
euclid
and
dr
todhunter
two
writers
who
are
excellent
because
possessed
with
a
passion
for
geometry
i
infer
then
that
the
framers
of
the
ordinance
when
they
employed
this
phrase
study
of
the
subject
of
english
literature
knew
well
enough
that
no
such
thing
existed
in
nature
but
adopted
the
convention
that
english
literature
could
be
separated
somehow
from
its
content
and
treated
as
a
subject
all
by
itself
for
teaching
purposes
and
for
purposes
of
examination
could
be
yoked
up
with
another
subject
called
english
language
as
other
universities
had
yoked
it
v
i
believe
the
following
to
be
a
fair
account
of
how
these
examinations
in
english
language
and
literature
came
to
pass
and
how
a
certain
kind
of
student
came
to
pass
these
examinations
at
any
rate
since
the
small
revolution
has
happened
in
my
and
most
of
it
since
i
was
able
to
observe
the
account
here
is
drawn
from
my
own
observation
and
may
be
checked
and
corrected
by
yours
or
forty
years
ago
say
in
the
late
seventies
or
early
eighties
some
preparatory
schools
and
others
that
taught
older
boys
but
ranked
below
the
great
public
schools
in
repute
taught
so
much
of
english
literature
as
might
be
comprised
at
a
rough
calculation
in
two
or
three
plays
of
shakespeare
edited
by
clark
and
aldis
wright
a
few
of
bacon
essays
early
poems
stopford
brooke
little
primer
a
book
of
extracts
for
committal
to
memory
with
perhaps
chaucer
prologue
and
a
speech
of
burke
in
the
great
public
schools
english
literature
was
studied
save
in
those
which
had
invented
sides
to
prepare
boys
specially
for
woolwich
or
sandhurst
or
the
indian
civil
service
for
entrance
to
which
examinations
were
held
on
certain
prescribed
english
classics
and
marks
mainly
given
for
acquaintance
with
the
editors
notes
in
the
universities
the
study
of
english
classics
was
not
officially
recognised
at
all
let
us
not
hastily
suppose
that
this
neglect
of
english
rested
wholly
on
unreason
or
had
nothing
to
say
for
itself
teachers
and
tutors
of
the
old
classical
education
as
it
was
called
could
plead
as
follows
the
first
place
they
would
say
literature
is
too
a
study
our
youth
at
school
or
university
starts
on
his
native
classics
with
a
liability
which
in
any
foreign
language
he
has
painfully
to
acquire
the
voices
that
murmured
around
his
cradle
the
voice
of
his
nurse
of
his
governess
of
the
parson
on
sundays
the
voices
of
village
boys
stablemen
gamekeepers
and
farmers
friendly
or
unfriendly
of
callers
acquaintances
of
the
children
he
met
at
children
parties
the
voices
that
at
the
poured
politics
or
local
gossip
into
the
little
pitcher
with
long
ears
all
these
were
english
voices
speaking
in
english
and
all
these
were
all
the
while
insensibly
leading
him
up
the
slope
from
the
summit
of
which
he
can
survey
the
promised
land
spread
at
his
feet
as
a
wide
park
and
he
holds
the
key
of
the
gates
to
enter
and
take
possession
whereas
the
old
instructors
would
continue
the
classics
of
any
foreign
language
we
take
him
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
ascent
spread
a
table
before
him
mensa
and
coax
or
drive
him
up
with
variations
upon
amo
i
love
or
greek
tupto
i
beat
until
he
too
reaches
the
summit
and
beholds
the
landscape
but
o
what
labour
o
prince
what
pain
now
so
much
of
truth
gentlemen
as
this
plea
contains
was
admitted
last
term
by
your
senate
in
separating
the
english
tripos
in
which
a
certain
linguistic
familiarity
may
be
not
rashly
presumed
of
the
student
from
the
foreign
language
triposes
divided
into
two
parts
of
which
the
first
will
more
suspiciously
test
his
capacity
to
construe
the
books
he
professes
to
have
studied
i
may
return
to
this
and
to
the
alleged
of
studies
in
a
school
of
english
let
us
proceed
just
now
with
the
reasoned
plea
for
neglect
these
admirable
old
schoolmasters
and
dons
would
have
hesitated
maybe
to
say
flatly
with
dogberry
that
write
and
read
comes
by
nature
and
for
your
writing
and
reading
let
that
appear
when
there
is
no
need
of
such
vanity
but
in
practice
their
system
so
worked
and
in
some
of
the
public
schools
so
works
to
this
day
let
me
tell
you
that
just
before
the
war
an
undergraduate
came
to
me
from
the
sixth
form
of
one
of
the
best
reputed
among
these
great
schools
he
wished
to
learn
to
write
he
wished
poor
fellow
to
write
me
an
essay
if
i
would
set
him
a
subject
he
had
never
written
an
essay
at
school
said
i
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
if
by
essay
you
mean
some
little
treatise
about
patriotism
or
a
day
in
the
country
i
will
choose
you
no
such
subject
nor
any
other
upon
any
book
which
you
have
never
read
tell
me
what
is
your
tripos
he
said
history
tripos
said
i
history
provides
quite
a
large
number
of
themes
choose
one
and
i
will
try
to
correct
your
treatment
of
it
without
offence
to
your
opinions
or
prejudice
to
your
facts
he
confessed
naming
the
great
public
school
never
out
an
account
of
anything
or
set
down
our
opinions
on
anything
to
be
corrected
we
just
construed
and
did
sums
and
when
he
brought
me
his
first
attempt
behold
it
was
so
he
could
not
construct
a
simple
sentence
let
alone
putting
two
sentences
together
while
as
for
a
paragraph
it
lay
beyond
his
farthest
horizon
in
short
here
was
an
instance
ready
to
hand
for
any
cheap
writer
engaged
to
decry
the
old
classical
education
what
would
the
old
schoolmasters
plead
in
excuse
why
this
as
i
suggest
cite
an
extreme
instance
but
while
granting
english
literature
to
be
great
we
would
point
out
that
an
overwhelming
majority
of
our
best
writers
have
modelled
their
prose
and
verse
upon
the
greek
and
roman
classics
either
directly
or
through
tradition
now
we
have
our
own
language
so
to
speak
let
us
spend
our
pains
then
in
acquiring
latin
and
greek
and
the
tradition
so
shall
we
most
intimately
enjoy
our
own
authors
and
so
if
we
wish
to
write
we
shall
have
at
hand
the
clues
they
followed
the
models
they
used
now
i
have
as
you
know
gentlemen
a
certain
sympathy
with
this
plea
or
with
a
part
of
it
nor
can
so
much
of
truth
as
its
argument
contains
be
silenced
by
a
about
shakespeare
or
a
about
bunyan
or
a
about
burns
i
believe
our
imaginary
pleader
for
the
classics
could
put
up
a
stout
defence
upon
any
of
those
names
to
choose
the
forlornest
hope
of
the
three
i
can
hear
him
demonstrating
to
his
own
satisfaction
if
not
to
yours
that
bunyan
took
his
style
straight
out
of
the
authorised
version
of
our
bible
which
is
to
say
that
he
took
it
from
the
styles
of
scholars
tyndale
coverdale
cranmer
the
scholarship
of
fifty
scholars
expressed
and
blended
but
as
a
theory
the
strict
classical
argument
gives
itself
away
as
well
by
its
intolerance
as
by
its
obvious
distrust
of
the
genius
of
our
own
wonderful
language
i
have
in
these
five
years
and
from
this
place
gentlemen
counselled
you
to
seek
back
ever
to
those
mediterranean
sources
which
are
the
of
our
civilisation
but
always
i
hope
on
the
understanding
that
you
use
them
with
a
large
liberty
they
are
effete
for
us
unless
we
add
and
mingle
freely
the
juice
of
our
own
natural
and
in
practice
the
strict
classical
theory
with
its
implied
contempt
of
english
has
been
disastrous
disastrous
not
only
with
the
ordinary
man
as
with
my
sixth
form
boy
who
could
not
put
two
sentences
together
and
had
read
no
english
authors
but
disastrous
even
to
highly
eminent
scholars
listen
pray
to
this
passage
from
one
of
them
frederick
paley
who
condescended
heaven
knows
why
to
turn
the
majestic
verse
of
pindar
into
english
prose
the
viiith
isthmian
and
now
that
we
are
returned
from
great
sorrows
let
us
not
fall
into
a
dearth
of
victories
nor
foster
griefs
but
as
we
have
ceased
from
our
tiresome
troubles
we
will
publicly
indulge
in
a
sweet
roundelay
the
ivth
pythian
it
had
been
divinely
predicted
to
pelias
that
he
should
die
by
the
doughty
sons
of
aeolus
and
an
alarming
oracle
had
come
to
his
wary
mind
delivered
at
the
central
point
of
he
must
by
all
means
hold
in
great
caution
the
man
with
one
shoe
when
he
shall
have
come
from
a
homestead
on
the
hills
and
he
accordingly
came
in
due
time
armed
with
two
spears
a
magnificent
man
the
dress
he
wore
was
of
a
double
kind
the
national
costume
of
the
magnesians
nor
as
yet
had
the
glossy
clusters
of
his
hair
been
clipped
away
but
dangled
brightly
adown
his
back
forward
he
went
at
once
and
took
his
stand
among
the
people
him
then
they
failed
to
recognise
but
some
of
the
went
so
far
as
to
say
this
can
not
be
apollo
it
needs
no
comment
i
think
surely
can
not
be
apollo
frederick
paley
flourished
if
the
word
be
not
exorbitant
for
so
demure
a
writer
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
he
was
born
in
the
year
of
waterloo
and
died
in
the
year
after
queen
victoria
first
jubilee
well
in
that
period
there
grew
up
a
race
of
pioneers
who
saw
that
english
literature
that
proud
park
and
rolling
estate
lay
a
tangled
neglected
wilderness
for
its
inheritors
and
set
themselves
bravely
to
clear
broad
ways
through
it
furnivall
and
skeat
aldis
wright
clark
grosart
arber
earle
hales
morris
ellis
and
the
rest
who
can
rehearse
these
names
now
but
in
deepest
respect
oh
believe
me
gentlemen
they
were
wonderful
fighters
in
a
cause
that
at
first
seemed
hopeless
if
i
presume
to
speak
of
foibles
you
will
understand
that
i
do
so
because
lightly
though
i
may
talk
to
you
at
times
i
have
a
real
sense
of
the
responsibilities
of
this
chair
i
worship
great
learning
which
they
had
i
loathe
flippant
detraction
of
what
is
great
i
have
usually
a
heart
for
and
the
unpopular
cause
but
these
very
valiant
fighters
had
one
and
all
some
very
obvious
foibles
and
because
in
the
hour
of
success
these
foibles
came
to
infect
the
whole
teaching
of
english
in
this
country
and
to
infect
it
fatally
for
many
years
i
shall
dare
to
point
them
out
vi
a
to
begin
with
then
these
valiant
fighters
intent
on
pushing
their
cause
to
the
front
kept
no
sense
of
proportion
all
their
geese
were
swans
and
beowulf
a
second
iliad
i
think
it
scarcely
too
much
to
say
that
of
these
men
all
so
staunch
in
fighting
for
the
claims
of
english
literature
not
one
with
the
exception
of
dr
hales
appears
to
have
had
any
critical
judgment
whatever
apart
from
the
rhyme
verse
and
inflectional
tests
on
which
they
bestowed
their
truly
priceless
industry
criticism
as
matthew
arnold
or
pater
understood
and
practised
it
they
merely
misprized
b
i
think
it
was
of
true
scholarly
desire
to
vindicate
english
literature
from
the
charge
of
being
easy
that
as
their
studies
advanced
they
laid
more
and
more
stress
on
and
old
english
writings
than
on
what
our
nations
of
england
and
scotland
have
written
since
they
learned
to
write
i
dare
to
think
also
that
we
may
attribute
to
this
dread
of
their
practice
of
cumbering
simple
texts
with
philological
notes
on
which
rather
than
on
the
text
we
unhappy
students
were
carefully
examined
for
an
example
supplied
to
dr
corson
i
take
those
three
lines
of
cowper

bk
i
thus
first
necessity
invented
stools
convenience
next
suggested
and
luxury
th
accomplish
sofa
last
now
in
these
three
lines
the
word
is
the
only
one
that
needs
even
the
smallest
explanation
says
dr
corson
two
different
editions
of
the
task
in
my
library
prepared
for
the
use
of
the
young
no
explanation
is
given
of
it
but
in
both
the
arabic
origin
of
is
given
in
one
the
question
is
asked
what
other
words
in
english
have
been
derived
from
the
arabic
would
be
my
little
contribution
c
these
valiant
fighters
having
to
extol
what
europe
had
wrongly
enough
forgotten
to
count
among
valuable
things
turned
aggressively
provincial
parted
their
beards
in
the
fashion
composed
long
sentences
painfully
innocent
of
any
word
not
derivable
from
sentences
in
which
the
of
matter
became
the
of
stuff
but
that
may
have
happened
in
a
parody
and
in
general
comported
themselves
like
the
they
claimed
for
their
forbears
rightly
enough
for
anything
anyone
cared
but
wrongly
enough
for
the
rest
of
us
who
had
no
yearning
toward
that
kinship
and
went
on
spelling
alfred
with
an
a
d
they
were
i
suppose
through
opposition
extremely
irascible
men
like
farmers
urbanity

the
last

in
their

was
no

an
athenian

which
they
frankly
despised
if
you
happened
to
disagree
with
them
their

politely
asked
your
way

on

e
these
pioneers
pushing
the
importance
of
english
but
occupied
more
and
more
with
origins
and
with
bad
authors
simply
could
not
see
the
vital
truth
that
english
literature
is
a
continuing
thing
ten
times
more
alive
than
it
was
in
the
times
they
studied
and
belauded
the
last
word
upon
them
is
that
not
a
man
of
them
could
write
prose
in
the
language
they
thrust
on
our
study
to
them
far
more
than
to
the
old
classical
scholars
english
was
a
shut
book
a
large
book
but
closed
and
clasped
material
to
heighten
a
desk
for
schoolmasters
and
schoolmistresses
but
schoolmasters
and
schoolmistresses
like
chickens
and
curses
come
home
to
roost
once
set
up
your
plea
for
a
tripos
of
english
language
and
literature
on
the
lower
plea
that
it
will
provide
for
what
call
a
want
and
sooner
or
later
you
give
english
language
and
literature
into
hands
and
then
you
get
the
fallacy
into
a
convention
english
literature
henceforth
is
a
divorced
from
life
and
what
they
have
made
of
it
let
a
thousand
handbooks
and
histories
attest
but
this
world
is
not
a
wilderness
of
english
language
they
can
not
write
it
at
all
events
they
do
not
so
far
as
i
can
discover
try
to
write
it
they
talk
and
write
about
it
how
the
poor
deceased
thing
outgrew
infantile
ailments
how
it
was
operated
on
for
how
it
parted
with
its
vermiform
appendix
and
its
inflexions
one
by
one
and
lost
its
vowel
endings
in
muted
e
and
they
went
and
told
the
sexton
and
the
sexton
toll
the
bell
but
when
it
comes
to
to
keeping
bright
the
noble
weapon
of
english
testing
its
poise
and
edge
feeling
the
grip
handing
it
to
their
pupils
with
the
word
is
the
sword
of
your
fathers
that
has
cloven
dragons
so
use
it
that
we
who
have
kept
it
bright
may
be
proud
of
you
and
of
our
pains
and
of
its
continuing
valiance
why
as
i
say
they
do
not
even
our
unprofessional
forefathers
when
they
put
pen
to
paper
did
attempt
english
prose
and
not
seldom
achieved
it
but
take
up
any
elaborate
history
of
english
literature
and
read
and
as
you
read
ask
yourselves
can
one
of
the
rarest
delights
of
life
be
converted
into
what
has
happened
to
merry
chaucer
rare
ben
jonson
gay
steele
and
prior
to
goldsmith
jane
austen
charles
lamb
all
all
are
gone
the
old
familiar
faces
gone
into
the
professional
and
the
next
news
is
that
these
cooks
of
whom
chaucer
wrote
prophetically
thise
cookes
how
they
stampe
and
streyne
and
grynde
and
turnen
substaunce
into
accident
have
formed
themselves
into
professional
associations
to
protect
study
of
the
subject
of
english
literature
and
bark
off
any
intruder
who
would
teach
in
another
way
than
theirs
vii
but
i
say
to
you
that
literature
is
not
and
should
not
be
the
preserve
of
any
priesthood
to
write
english
so
as
to
make
literature
may
be
but
english
literature
is
a
mystery
a
professors
kitchen
and
the
trouble
lies
not
in
the
harm
professionising
does
to
schoolmasters
and
schoolmistresses
but
in
the
harm
it
does
widest
commonalty
spread
among
men
and
women
who
as
literature
was
written
for
them
addressed
to
them
ought
to
find
in
it
all
their
lives
through
a
retirement
from
mean
occupations
a
well
of
refreshment
sustainment
in
the
daily
drudgery
of
life
solace
in
calamity
an
inmate
by
the
hearth
ever
sociable
never
intrusive
to
be
sought
and
found
to
be
found
and
dropped
at
will
men
when
their
affairs
require
must
themselves
at
whiles
retire
sometimes
hunt
and
sometimes
hawk
and
not
ever
sit
and
talk
to
be
dropped
at
will
and
left
without
any
answering
growl
of
moroseness
to
be
consulted
again
at
will
and
found
friendly
for
this
is
the
trouble
of
literature
we
exile
it
from
the
business
of
life
in
which
it
would
ever
be
at
our
shoulder
to
befriend
us
listen
for
example
to
an
extract
from
a
letter
written
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
by
somebody
in
the
charity
commission
sir
with
reference
to
previous
correspondence
in
this
matter
i
am
to
say
that
in
all
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
commissioners
are
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
desirable
that
a
public
enquiry
in
connection
with
the
charity
should
be
held
in
the
locality
and
the
man
very
likely
an
educated
man
having

home

read

for

is

happens

literature
as
a
separable
from
life

practice
viii
i
declare
to
you
that
literature
was
written
for
schoolmasters
nor
for
schoolmistresses
i
would
not
exchange
it
for
a
wilderness
of
schoolmasters
it
should
be
delivered
from
them
who
with
their
silly
and
can
themselves
neither
read
nor
write
for
the
proof
having
the
world
quintessential
store
of
mirth
and
sharp
sorrow
wit
humour
comfort
farce
comedy
tragedy
satire
the
glories
of
our
birth
and
state
piled
all
at
their
elbows
only
one
man
of
the
crowd
and
he
jusserand
a
frenchman
has
contrived
to
draw
out
of
the
mass
one
interesting
history
of
the
ix
is
there
then
no
better
way
yes
there
is
a
better
way
for
the
french
have
it
with
their
language
and
literature
in
france
as
matthew
arnold
noted
a
generation
ago
the
ordinary
work
of
literature
is
done
far
better
and
more
conscientiously
than
with
us
in
france
a
man
feels
it
almost
a
personal
stain
an
unpatriotic
to
write
even
on
a
anything
so
derogatory
to
the
tradition
of
his
language
as
our
cabinet
ministers
read
out
as
answers
to
our
house
of
commons
i
am
told
that
many
a
maire
in
a
small
provincial
town
in
france
even
when
overwhelmed
with
the
sufferings
of
his
has
truly
felt
the
iron
enter
into
his
soul
on
being
forced
to
sign
a
document
written
out
for
him
in
the
french
can
not
we
treat
our
noble
inheritance
of
literature
and
language
as
scrupulously
and
with
as
high
a
sense
of
their
appertaining
to
our
national
honour
as
a
frenchman
cherishes
language
literature
can
not
we
study
to
leave
our
inheritance
the
old
athenian
put
it
temperately
worse
but
a
little
better
than
we
found
it
i
think
we
can
and
should
i
shall
close
gentlemen
with
the
most
modest
of
perorations
in
my
first
lecture
before
you
in
january
i
quoted
to
you
the
artist
in
don
quixote
who
being
asked
what
animal
he
was
painting
answered
diffidently
is
as
it
may
turn
out
the
teaching
of
our
language
and
literature
is
after
all
a
new
thing
and
still
experimental
the
main
tenets
of
those
who
aware
of
this
have
worked
on
the
scheme
for
a
school
of
english
in
cambridge
the
scheme
recently
passed
by
your
senate
and
henceforth
to
be
in
operation
are
three
that
literature
can
not
be
divorced
from
life
that
for
example
you
can
not
understand
chaucer
aright
unless
you
have
the
background
unless
you
know
the
kind
of
men
for
whom
chaucer
wrote
and
the
kind
of
men
whom
he
made
speak
that
is
the
side
with
which
all
our
literature
is
concerned
literature
being
so
personal
a
thing
you
can
not
understand
it
until
you
have
some
personal

who
wrote
it

as

you
can
not
grasp
their

that
is
the
side
of
literary
study
and
as
necessary
as
the
other
that
the
writing
and
speaking
of
english
is
a
living
art
to
be
practised
and
if
it
may
be
improved
that
what
these
great
men
have
done
is
to
hand
us
a

patrimony
that
they
lived
to

us
through

in

lecture
vii
the
value
of
greek
and
latin
in
english
literature
wednesday
february
i
i
have
promised
you
gentlemen
for
some
observations
on
value
of
greek
and
latin
in
english
a
mild
academic
title
a
title
so
to
say
calculated
to
shelter
us
for
a
while
from
the
vigilance
of
those
reformers
who
had
i
advertised
value
of
greek
and
latin
in
english
might
even
now
be
swooping
from
all
quarters
of
the
sky
on
a
suggestion
that
these
dry
bones
yet
were
flesh
for
the
eyes
i
dread
are
not
only
red
and
angry
but
naturally
microscopic
and
that
indeed
if
they
only
knew
it
is
their
malady
yet
groaned
patient
job
a
path
which
the
vulture
eye
hath
not
seen
you
at
any
rate
know
by
this
time
that
wherever
these
lectures
assert
literature
they
assert
life
perhaps
even
too
passionately
allowing
neither
the
fact
of
death
nor
the
possibility
of
divorce
ii
but
let
us
begin
with
the
first
word
of
greek
and
latin
in
english
literature
what
do
i
mean
by
well
i
use
it
generally
in
the
sense
of
but
with
a
particular
meaning
or
shade
of
meaning
too
and
this
particular
meaning
is
not
the
particular
meaning
intended
as
i
suppose
by
men
of
commerce
who
on
news
of
a
friend
death
fall
and
continue
musing
until
the
fire
kindles
and
they
ask
did
die
worth
or
sometimes
more
wisely
than
they
know
did
poor
old
die
worth
or
again
more
colloquially
did
cut
up
for
neither
is
it
that
which
more
disinterested
economists
used
to
teach
men
never
i
fear
me
loved
but
anyhow
lost
awhile
who
for
my
green
unknowing
youth
at
thebes
or
athens
growing
older
i
tend
to
forget
which
is
or
was
which
defined
the
value
of
a
thing
as
its
power
which
the
market
translates
into
for
to
borrow
a
phrase
which
i
happened
on
the
other
day
with
delight
in
the
introduction
to
a
translation
of
lucian
there
may
be
forms
of
education
less
paying
than
the
commercial
and
yet
better
worth
paying
for
nay
above
payment
or
computation
in
price
no
the
particular
meaning
i
use
is
that
which
artists
use
when
they
talk
of
painting
or
of
music
to
see
things
near
or
far
in
their
true
perspective
and
proportions
to
judge
them
through
distance
and
fetching
them
back
to
reproduce
them
in
art
so
proportioned
comparatively
so
rightly
adjusted
that
they
combine
to
make
a
particular
and
just
perspective
that
is
to
give
things
their
true
suppose
yourself
reclining
on
a
bank
on
a
clear
day
looking
up
into
the
sky
and
watching
the
ascent
of
a
skylark
while
you
listen
to
his
song
that
is
a
posture
in
which
several
poets
of
repute
have
placed
themselves
from
time
to
time
so
we
need
not
be
ashamed
of
it
well
you
see
the
atmosphere
reaching
up
and
up
mile
upon
mile
there
are
no
milestones
planted
there
but
wave
on
wave
perceptible
the
atmosphere
stretches
up
through
indeterminate
distances
and
according
as
your
painter
of
the
sky
can
translate
these
distances
he
gives
his
sky
what
is
called
you
listen
to
the
skylark
note
rising
spiral
by
spiral
on
very
jet
of
earth
as
up
he
wings
the
spiral
stair
a
song
of
light
and
pierces
air
with
fountain
ardour
fountain
play
to
reach
the
shining
tops
of
day
and
you
long
for
the
musical
gift
to
follow
up
and
up
the
delicate
degrees
of
distance
and
thread
the
notes
back
as
the
bird
ascending
drops
them
on
a
thread
as
it
were
of
graduated
beads
half
music
and
half
dew
that
was
the
chirp
of
ariel
you
heard
as
overhead
it
flew
the
farther
going
more
to
dwell
and
wing
our
green
to
wed
our
blue
but
whether
note
of
joy
or
knell
not
his
own
knew
nor
yet
can
any
mortal
tell
save
only
how
it
shivers
through
the
breast
of
us
a
sounded
shell
the
blood
of
us
a
lighted
dew
well
in
music
in
painting
this
graduating
which
gives
right
proportion
and
with
proportion
a
sense
of
distance
of
atmosphere
is
called
let
us
for
a
minute
or
two
assay
this
particular
meaning
of
value
upon
life
and
literature
and
first
upon
life
or
rather
upon
one
not
negligible
facet
of
life
i
suppose
that
if
an
ordinary
man
of
my
age
were
asked
which
has
better
helped
him
to
bear
the
burs
of
life
religion
or
a
sense
of
humour
he
would
were
he
quite
honest
be
gravelled
for
an
answer
now
the
best
part
of
a
sense
of
humour
as
you
know
without
my
telling
you
consists
in
a
sense
of
proportion
a
habit
abiding
and
prompt
at
command
of
seeing
all
human
affairs
in
their
just
perspective
so
that
its
happy
possessor
at
once
perceives
anything
odd
or
distorted
or
overblown
to
be
an
excrescence
a
protuberance
a
swelling
literally
a
and
the
function
of
thalia
the
comic
spirit
as
you
may
read
in
meredith
essay
on
comedy
is
just
to
prick
these
humours
i
will
but
refer
you
to
meredith
essay
and
here
cite
you
the
words
of
an
old
schoolmaster
it
would
seem
to
be
characteristic
of
the
same
mind
to
appreciate
the
beauty
of
ideas
in
just
proportion
and
harmonious
relation
to
each
other
and
the
absurdity
of
the
same
ideas
when
distorted
or
brought
into
incongruous
juxtaposition
the
exercise
of
this
sense
of
humour
compels
the
mind
to
form
a
picture
to
itself
accompanied
by
pleasurable
emotion
and
what
is
this
but
setting
the
imagination
to
work
though
in
fashion
nay
in
such
a
case
imagination
plays
a
double
part
since
it
is
only
by
instantaneous
comparison
with
ideal
fitness
and
proportion
that
it
can
grasp
at
full
force
the
grotesqueness
of
their
contraries
let
us
play
with
an
example
for
one
moment
a
child
sees
such
an
excrescence
such
an
offence
upon
proportion
in
an
immoderately
long
nose
he
is
apt
to
call
attention
to
it
on
the
visage
of
a
visitor
it
intrigues
him
in
perrault
charming
and
many
a
fairy
tale
it
amuses
him
in
lear
book
of
nonsense
there
was
an
old
man
with
a
nose
who
said
you
choose
to
suppose
that
my
nose
is
too
long
you
are
certainly
wrong
this
old
man
he
detects
as
lacking
sense
of
proportion
sense
of
humour
pass
from
the
child
to
the
as
we
know
him
a
few
weeks
ago
a
lady
featured
as
to
nose
on
the
side
of
excess
was
addressing
a
north
country
audience
on
the
economic
position
of
women
after
the
war
said
she
wo
be
men
to
go
round
said
a
voice
but
they
to
miss
pass
from
this
rudimentary
criticism
to
high
talent
employed
on
the
same
subject
and
you
get
cyrano
de
bergerac
pass
to
genius
to
milton
and
you
find
the
elephant
amusing
adam
and
eve
in
paradise
and
doing
his
best
the
unwieldy
elephant
to
make
them
mirth
used
all
his
might
and
wreathed
his
lithe
proboscis
milton
like
the
elephant
jokes
with
difficulty
but
he
too
is
using
all
his
might
i
have
illustrated
crudely
enough
how
a
sense
of
things
in
their
right
values
will
help
us
on
one
side
of
our
dealings
with
life
but
truly
it
helps
us
on
every
side
this
was
what
plato
meant
when
he
said
that
a
philosopher
must
see
things
as
they
relatively
are
within
his
horizon
greek
o
synoptikos
dialektikos
and
for
this
it
was
that
an
english
poet
praised
sophocles
as
one
who
saw
life
steadily
and
saw
it
whole
and
this
of
course
is
what
dean
inge
meant
when
the
other
day
in
a
volume
of
cambridge
essays
on
education
he
reminded
us
for
a
sensible
commonplace
that
wise
man
is
he
who
knows
the
relative
values
of
things
iv
applying
this
to
literature
i
note
but
shall
not
insist
here
on
the
fact
though
fact
it
is
that
the
greek
and
roman
writers
as
we
call
them
laid
more
stress
than
has
ever
been
laid
among
the
subsequent
tribes
of
men
upon
the
desirability
of
getting
all
things
into
proportion
of
seeing
all
life
on
a
scale
of
relative
values
and
the
reason
i
shall
not
insist
on
this
is
simply
that
better
men
have
saved
me
the
trouble
i
propose
this
morning
to
discuss
the
value
of
the
classics
to
students
of
english
literature
from
as
the
modern
phrase
goes
a
slightly
different
angle
reclining
and
looking
up
into
that
sky
which
is
not
too
grandiose
an
image
for
our
own
english
literature
you
would
certainly
not
wish
gentlemen
to
see
it
as
what
it
is
not
as
a
cloth
painted
on
the
flat
no
more
than
you
would
choose
the
sky
overarching
your
life
to
be
a
close
hard
copper
vault
would
you
choose
this
literature
of
ours
to
resemble
such
a
prison
i
say
nothing
for
the
moment
of
the
thrill
of
comparing
ours
with
other
constellations
of
such
a
thrill
as
blanco
white
famous
sonnet
imagines
in
adam
soul
when
the
first
night
descended
on
eden
and
hesperus
with
the
host
of
heaven
came
and
lo
creation
widen
in
man
view
who
could
have
thought
such
darkness
lay
within
thy
beams
o
sun
no
i
simply
picture
you
as
desiring
to
realise
literature
its
depths
and
values
mile
above
mile
deeper
and
deeper
shining
with
perchance
a
glimpse
of
a
city
celestial
beyond
or
at
whiles
on
a
ladder
of
values
of
the
angels
the
messengers
climbing
and
returning
v
well
now
i
put
it
to
you
that
without
mental
breeding
without
at
least
some
sense
of
ancestry
an
englishman
can
hardly
have
this
perception
of
value
this
vision
i
put
to
you
what
i
posited
in
an
earlier
course
of
lectures
quoting
bagehot
that
while
a
knowledge
of
greek
and
latin
is
not
necessary
to
a
writer
of
english
he
should
at
least
have
a
firm
conviction
that
those
two
languages
existed
i
refer
you
to
a
long
passage
which
in
one
of
those
lectures
i
quoted
from
cardinal
newman
to
the
effect
that
for
the
last
years
the
western
world
has
been
evolving
a
human
society
having
its
bond
a
common
a
society
to
which
let
me
add
by
way
of
footnote
prussia
today
is
firmly
though
with
great
difficulty
being
tamed
there
are
and
have
been
other
civilisations
in
the
world
the
chinese
for
instance
a
huge
civilisation
stationary
morose
to
us
unattractive
civilisation
says
newman
with
the
society
which
is
its
creation
and
its
home
is
so
distinctive
and
luminous
in
its
character
so
imperial
in
its
extent
so
imposing
in
its
duration
and
so
utterly
without
rival
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
that
the
association
may
fitly
assume
for
itself
the
title
of
human
society
and
its
civilisation
the
abstract
term
civilisation
he
goes
on
looking
then
at
the
countries
which
surround
the
mediterranean
sea
as
a
whole
i
see
them
to
be
from
time
immemorial
the
seat
of
an
association
of
intellect
and
mind
such
as
deserves
to
be
called
the
intellect
and
mind
of
the
human
kind
but
i
must
refer
you
to
his
famous
book
the
idea
of
a
university
to
read
at
length
how
newman
in
that
sinuous
sinewy
platonic
style
of
his
works
it
out
the
spread
through
rome
even
to
our
shores
of
the
civilisation
which
began
in
palestine
and
greece
vi
i
would
press
the
point
more
rudely
upon
you
and
more
particularly
than
does
newman
and
first
for
latin
i
waive
that
rome
occupied
and
dominated
this
island
during
years
let
that
be
as
though
it
had
never
been
for
a
further
years
and
more
latin
remained
the
common
speech
of
educated
men
throughout
europe
the
language
greek
had
been
smothered
by
the
turk
through
all
that
time
through
the
most
of
what
we
call
modern
history
latin
reigned
everywhere
is
this
a
fact
to
be
ignored
by
any
of
you
who
would
value
here
are
a
few
particulars
by
way
of
illustration

can
nor
have
the
bigots
of
this
iron
time
call
their
harmless
art
a
crime
but
there
is
a
better
reason
why
you
should
endeavour
to
understand
the
value
of
latin
in
our
literature
a
filial
reason
our
fathers
built
their
great
english
prose
as
they
built
their
oratory
upon
the
latin
model
donne
used
it
to
construct
his
mighty
fugues
burke
to
discipline
his
luxuriance
says
cowper
it
were
praise
enough
for
any
private
man
that
chatham
language
was
his
mother
tongue
and
wolfe
great
name
compatriot
with
his
own
well
then
here
is
a
specimen
of
chatham
language
from
his
speech
romanly
severe
denouncing
the
government
of
the
day
for
employing
red
indians
in
the
american
war
of
independence
he
is
addressing
the
house
of
lords
i
call
upon
that
right
reverend
bench
those
holy
ministers
of
the
gospel
and
pious
pastors
of
our
church
i
conjure
them
to
join
in
the
holy
work
and
vindicate
the
religion
of
their
god
i
appeal
to
the
wisdom
and
the
law
of
this
learned
bench
to
defend
and
support
the
justice
of
their
country
i
call
upon
the
bishops
to
interpose
the
unsullied
sanctity
of
their
lawn
upon
the
learned
judges
to
interpose
the
purity
of
their
ermine
to
save
us
from
this
pollution
i
call
upon
the
honour
of
your
lordships
to
reverence
the
dignity
of
your
ancestors
and
to
maintain
your
own
i
call
upon
the
spirit
and
humanity
of
my
country
to
vindicate
the
national
character
i
invoke
the
genius
of
the
constitution
from
the
tapestry
that
adorns
these
walls
the
immortal
ancestor
of
this
noble
lord
lord
suffolk
frowns
with
indignation
at
the
disgrace
of
his
country
in
vain
he
led
your
victorious
fleet
against
the
boasted
armada
of
spain
in
vain
he
defended
and
established
the
honour
the
liberties
the
religion
the
of
this
country
against
the
arbitrary
cruelties
of
popery
and
the
inquisition
if
these
more
than
popish
cruelties
and
inquisitorial
practices
are
let
loose
among
us
to
turn
forth
into
our
settlements
among
our
ancient
connexions
friends
and
relations
the
merciless
cannibal
thirsting
for
the
blood
of
man
woman
and
child
to
send
forth
the
infidel
savage
whom
against
your
protestant
brethren
to
lay
waste
their
country
to
desolate
their
dwellings
and
extirpate
their
race
and
name
with
these
horrible
of
savage
war
i
say
of
savage
war
spain
armed
herself
with
to
extirpate
the
wretched
natives
of
america
and
we
improve
on
the
inhuman
example
even
of
spanish
cruelty
we
turn
loose
these
savage
against
our
brethren
and
countrymen
in
america
of
the
same
language
laws
liberties
and
religion
endeared
to
us
by
every
tie
that
should
sanctify
humanity
my
lords
i
am
old
and
weak
and
at
present
unable
to
say
more
but
my
feelings
and
indignation
were
too
strong
to
have
said
less
i
could
not
have
slept
this
night
in
my
bed
nor
reposed
my
head
on
my
pillow
without
giving
this
vent
to
my
eternal
abhorrence
of
such
preposterous
and
enormous
principles
that
was
chatham
for
wolfe
he
as
you
know
was
ever
reading
the
classics
even
on
campaign
as
burke
again
carried
always
a
virgil
in
his
pocket
studia
in
moreover
can
we
separate
chatham
roman
morality
from
chatham
language
in
the
passage
i
have
just
read
no
we
can
not
no
one
being
evil
can
speak
good
things
with
that
weight
out
of
the
abundance
of
the
heart
the
mouth
speaketh
we
english
says
wordsworth
we
must
be
free
or
die
who
speak
the
tongue
that
shakespeare
spake
you
may
criticise
chatham
style
as
too
consciously
ciceronian
but
has
ever
a
parliamentary
style
been
invented
which
conveys
a
nobler
gravity
of
emotion
yes
but
the
style
of
a
man
yes
but
in
the
grand
manner
yes
but
of
what
conscious
of
the
dignity
a
great
man
owes
to
himself
and
to
the
assembly
he
addresses
he
conceives
that
assembly
as
british
senate
and
assuming
he
communicates
that
high
conception
the
lords
feel
that
they
are
listening
as
senators
since
it
is
only
thus
a
senate
should
be
addressed
as
nothing
less
than
a
senate
should
be
addressed
thus
let
me
read
you
a
second
passage
of
prose
laodameia
died
helen
died
leda
the
beloved
of
jupiter
went
before
it
is
better
to
repose
in
the
earth
betimes
than
to
sit
up
late
better
than
to
cling
pertinaciously
to
what
we
feel
crumbling
under
us
and
to
protract
an
inevitable
fall
we
may
enjoy
the
present
while
we
are
insensible
of
infirmity
and
decay
but
the
present
like
a
note
in
music
is
nothing
but
as
it
appertains
to
what
is
past
and
what
is
to
come
there
are
no
fields
of
amaranth
on
this
aide
of
the
grave
there
are
no
voices
o
rhodopè
that
are
not
soon
mute
however
tuneful
there
is
no
name
with
whatever
emphasis
of
passionate
love
repeated
of
which
the
echo
is
not
faint
at
last
latin
all
latin
down
to
its
exquisite
falling
close
and
i
say
to
you
gentlemen
that
passages
such
as
these
deserve
what
joubert
claimed
of
national
monuments
sont
les
crampons
qui
unissent
une
génération
à
une
autre
conservez
ce
vu
vos
pères
are
the
clamps
that
knit
one
generation
to
another
cherish
those
things
on
which
your
fathers
eyes
have
looked
studia
in
if
years
ago
there
had
lacked
anything
to
sharpen
my
suspicion
of
those
professors
who
derived
our
prose
from
the
stucco
of
prose
it
would
have
been
their
foolish
deliberate
practice
of
composing
whole
pages
of
english
prose
without
using
one
word
derivative
from
latin
or
greek
esau
when
he
sold
his
birthright
had
the
excuse
of
being
famished
these
pedants
with
a
full
board
sought
frenetically
to
give
it
away
board
and
birthright
when
this
corruptible
shall
have
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
shall
have
put
on
almost
i
say
these
men
had
deserved
to
have
a
kind
of
speech
more
to
their
taste
read
over
their
coffins
vii
what
in
the
next
place
can
i
say
of
greek
save
that
as
latin
gave
our
fathers
the
model
of
prose
greek
was
the
source
of
it
all
the
goddess
and
genius
of
the
and
casting
about
to
illustrate
as
well
as
may
be
what
i
mean
by
this
i
hit
on
a
minor
dialogue
of
plato
the
phaedrus
and
choose
you
a
short
passage
in
edward
fitzgerald
rendering
when
socrates
and
phaedrus
have
discoursed
away
the
under
the
plane
trees
by
the
ilissus
they
rise
to
depart
toward
the
city
but
socrates
pointing
perhaps
to
some
images
of
pan
and
other
sylvan
deities
says
it
is
not
decent
to
leave
their
haunts
without
praying
to
them
and
he
prays
auspicious
pan
and
ye
other
deities
of
this
place
grant
to
me
to
become
beautiful
and
that
all
my
outward
goods
may
prosper
my
inner
soul
grant
that
i
may
esteem
wisdom
the
only
riches
and
that
i
may
have
so
much
gold
as
temperance
can
handsomely
carry
we
yet
aught
else
to
pray
for
phaedrus
for
myself
i
seem
to
have
prayed
enough
as
much
for
me
also
for
friends
have
all
in
common
so
be
it
let
us
to
this
paternoster
of
socrates
reported
more
than
four
centuries
before
christ
taught
the
lord
prayer
let
me
add
an
attempted
translation
of
the
lines
that
close
homer
hymn
to
the
delian
apollo
imagine
the
old
blind
poet
on
the
beach
chanting
to
the
islanders
the
glorious
boast
of
the
little
island
how
it
of
all
lands
had
harboured
leto
in
her
difficult
travail
how
she
gave
birth
to
the
sun
god
how
the
immortal
child
as
the
attendant
goddesses
touched
his
lips
with
ambrosia
burst
his
swaddling
bands
and
stood
up
sudden
a
god
erect
but
he
the
did
no
sooner
taste
that
food
divine
than
every
swaddling
band
burst
strand
by
strand
and
burst
the
belt
above
his
panting
waist
all
hanging
loose
about
him
as
he
stood
and
gave
command
me
my
lyre
fetch
me
my
curving
bow
and
taught
by
these
shall
know
all
men
through
me
the
unfaltering
will
of
zeus
so
spake
the
unshorn
god
the
archer
bold
and
turn
to
tread
the
ways
of
earth
so
wide
while
they
all
they
had
marvel
to
behold
how
delos
broke
in
gold
beneath
his
feet
as
on
a
sudden
in
spring
a
tree
is
glorified
and
canopied
with
blossoms
manifold
but
he
went
swinging
with
a
careless
stride
proud
in
his
new
artillery
bedight
up
rocky
cynthus
and
the
isles
descried
all
his
and
their
inhabitants
for
wide
wide
as
he
roam
ran
these
in
rivalry
to
build
him
temples
in
many
groves
and
these
be
his
and
all
the
isles
he
loves
and
every
foreland
height
and
every
river
hurrying
to
the
sea
but
chief
in
thee
delos
as
first
it
was
is
his
delight
where
the
ionians
each
with
mate
and
children
pious
to
his
altar
throng
and
decent
celebrate
his
birth
with
and
dance
and
song
so
that
a
stranger
happening
them
among
would
deem
that
these
ionians
have
no
date
being
ageless
all
so
met
and
he
should
gaze
and
marvel
at
their
ways
health
wealth
the
comely
face
on
man
and
woman
envying
their
estate
and
yet
shall
he
least
be
able
to
forget
you
maids
of
delos
dear
ones
as
ye
raise
the
hymn
to
phoebus
leto
artemis
in
triune
praise
then
slide
your
song
back
upon
ancient
days
and
men
whose
very
name
forgotten
and
women
who
have
lived
and
gone
their
ways
and
make
them
live
agen
charming
the
tribes
of
men
whose
speech
ye
mock
with
pretty
mimicries
so
true
they
almost
woo
the
hearer
to
believe
he
singing
too
speed
me
apollo
speed
me
artemis
and
you
my
dears
farewell
remember
me
hereafter
if
from
any
land
that
is
some
traveller
question
ye
who
was
the
sweetest
man
of
speech
fared
hither
ever
chanted
on
this
beach
i
you
beseech
make
answer
to
him
civilly
he
was
just
a
blind
man
and
his
home
in
rocky
chios
but
his
songs
were
best
and
shall
be
ever
in
the
days
to
come
say
that
and
as
i
quest
in
fair
wall
cities
far
i
tell
them
there
they
list
for
be
true
of
delos
and
of
you
but
chief
and
evermore
my
song
shall
be
of
prince
apollo
lord
of
archery
god
of
the
silver
bow
whom
leto
bare
leto
the
did
time
permit
i
might
quote
you
a
chorus
of
aeschylus
a
passage
from
thucydides
or
from
aristotle
to
illustrate
saying
that
the
greek
language
a
soul
to
the
objects
of
sense
and
a
body
to
the
abstractions
of
metaphysics
but
there
it
is
and
it
has
haunted
our
literature
at
first
filtering
through
latin
at
length
breaking
from
constantinople
in
flood
and
led
to
us
to
oxford
and
cambridge
by
erasmus
by
grocyn
thee
that
lord
of
splendid
lore
orient
from
old
hellas
shore
to
have
a
sense
of
greek
too
is
to
own
a
corrective
of
taste
i
quote
another
old
schoolmaster
here
a
dead
friend
sidney
irwin
what
the
greeks
disliked
was
extravagance
caprice
boastfulness
and
display
of
all
kinds
the
greeks
all
monsters
the
quaint
phrase
in
the
odyssey
about
the
queen
of
the
laestrygones
was
tall
as
a
mountain
and
they
hated
her
would
have
seemed
to
them
most
reasonable
to
read
greek
is
to
have
a
perpetual
witness
to
the
virtue
of
pruning
of
condensing
a
perpetual
protest
against
all
that
crowds
and
swells
and
weakens
the
writer
purpose
to
forget
this
is
but
to
our
skill
in
covetousness
we
can
not
all
be
writers
but
we
all
wish
to
have
good
taste
and
good
taste
is
born
of
a
generous
caution
about
letting
oneself
go
i
say
for
caution
is
seldom
generous
but
it
is
a
generous
mood
which
is
in
no
haste
to
assert
itself
to
consider
the
thing
the
time
the
place
the
person
and
to
take
yourself
and
your
own
feelings
is
to
be
against
bad
taste
viii
they
tell
us
that
greek
is
going
here
well
i
hold
no
brief
for
compulsory
greek
and
i
shall
say
but
one
word
on
it
i
put
it
rather
idly
to
a
vote
in
a
cambridge
combination
room
the
other
day
and
was
amazed
to
find
how
the
votes
were
divided
the
men
of
science
were
by
no
means
unanimous
they
owned
that
there
was
much
to
be
said
even
for
compulsory
greek
if
only
greek
had
been
intelligently
taught
and
with
that
of
course
i
agree
for
to
learn
greek
is
after
all
a
baptism
into
a
noble
cult
the
romans
knew
i
believe
that
even
yet
if
the
schools
would
rebuild
their
instruction
in
greek
so
as
to
make
it
interesting
as
it
ought
to
be
from
the
first
we
should
oust
those
birds
who
croak
and
chatter
upon
the
walls
of
our
old
universities
i
find
the
following
in
fitzgerald
polonius
an
old
ruinous
tower
which
had
harboured
innumerable
jackdaws
sparrows
and
bats
was
at
length
repaired
when
the
masons
left
it
the
jackdaws
sparrows
and
bats
came
back
in
search
of
their
old
dwellings
but
these
were
all
filled
up
what
use
now
is
this
great
building
said
they
let
us
forsake
this
useless
and
the
beauty
of
this
little
apologue
is
that
you
can
read
it
either
way
ix
but
although
a
student
of
english
literature
be
ignorant
of
greek
and
latin
as
languages
may
he
not
have
greek
and
latin
literature
widely
opened
to
him
by
intelligent
translations
the
question
has
often
been
asked
but
i
ask
it
again
may
not
translations
open
a
door
to
him
by
which
he
can
see
them
through
an
atmosphere
and
in
that
atmosphere
the
authentic
ancient
gods
walking
so
that
returning
upon
english
literature
he
may
recognise
them
there
too
walking
and
talking
in
a
garden
of
values
the
highest
poetical
speech
of
any
one
language
defies
in
my
belief
translation
into
any
other
but
herodotus
loses
little
and
north
is
every
whit
as
good
as
plutarch
sigh
no
more
ladies
ladies
sigh
no
more
men
were
deceivers
ever
one
foot
in
sea
and
one
on
shore
to
one
thing
constant
never
suppose
that
rendered
thus
i
enjoin
upon
the
adult
female
population
greek
gynaikes
not
once
but
twice
that
there
be
from
this
time
forward
a
total
cessation
of
sighing
the
male
is
and
has
been
constantly
addicted
to
inconstancy
treading
the
ocean
and
the
mainland
respectively
with
alternate
feet
that
more
or
less
is
what
paley
did
upon
euripides
and
how
would
you
like
it
if
a
modern
greek
did
it
upon
shakespeare
none
the
less
i
remember
that
my
own
first
awed
surmise
of
what
greek
might
mean
came
from
a
translated
story
of
herodotus
the
story
of
cleobis
and
biton
at
the
tail
of
an
old
before
i
had
learnt
the
greek
alphabet
and
i
am
sure
that
the
instinct
of
the
old
translators
was
sound
that
somehow
as
wordsworth
says
somewhere
the
present
must
be
balanced
on
the
wings
of
the
past
and
the
future
and
that
as
you
stretch
out
the
one
you
stretch
out
the
other
to
strength
x
there
is
no
derogation
of
new
things
in
this
plea
i
make
specially
to
you
who
may
be
candidates
in
our
school
of
english
you
may
remember
my
reading
to
you
in
a
previous
lecture
that
liberal
poem
of
cory
invoking
the
spirit
of
divine
comatas
that
two
minds
shall
flow
together
the
english
and
the
greek
well
i
would
have
your
minds
as
you
read
our
literature
reach
back
to
that
dorian
shepherd
through
an
atmosphere
his
made
ours
as
through
veils
each
veil
unfolding
a
value
so
you
will
recognise
how
from
chaucer
down
our
literature
has
panted
after
the
mediterranean
so
through
an
atmosphere
you
will
link
let
me
say
collins
ode
to
evening
or
matthew

viii
on
reading
the
bible
i
wednesday
march
i
not
to
contradict
and
confute
says
bacon
of
studies
in
general
and
you
may
be
the
better
disposed
gentlemen
to
forgive
my
choice
of
subject
if
in
my
first
sentence
i
rule
way
of
reading
the
bible
completely
out
of
court
you
may
say
at
once
that
the
bible
being
so
full
of
doctrine
as
it
is
and
such
a
storehouse
for
exegesis
as
it
has
been
this
is
more
easily
said
than
profitably
done
you
may
grant
me
that
the
scriptures
in
our
authorised
version
are
part
and
parcel
of
english
literature
and
more
than
part
and
parcel
you
may
grant
that
a
professor
of
english
literature
has
therefore
a
claim
if
not
an
obligation
to
speak
of
them
in
that
version
you
may
having
granted
my
incessant
refusal
to
disconnect
our
national
literature
from
our
national
life
or
to
view
them
as
disconnected
accept
the
conclusion
which
plainly
flows
from
it
that
no
teacher
of
english
can
pardonably
neglect
what
is
at
once
the
most
majestic
thing
in
our
literature
and
by
all
odds
the
most
spiritually
living
thing
we
inherit
in
our
courts
at
once
superb
monument
and
superabundant
fountain
of
life
and
yet
you
may
discount
beforehand
what
he
must
attempt
for
say
you
if
he
attempt
the
doctrine
he
goes
straight
down
to
buffeted
waters
so
broad
that
only
stout
theologians
can
win
to
shore
if
on
the
other
hand
he
ignore
doctrine
the
play
is
hamlet
with
the
prince
of
denmark
left
out
he
reduces
our
bible
to
literature
to
something
pretty
an
artifice
a
flimsy
a
gutted
thing
ii
now
of
all
ways
of
dealing
with
literature
that
happens
to
be
the
way
we
should
least
admire
by
that
way
we
disassociate
literature
from
life
they
said
from
the
men
who
said
it
and
meant
it
not
seldom
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
my
pupils
will
bear
witness
in
their
memories
that
when
we
talk
together
concerning
poetry
for
example
by
we
mean
which
the
poets
wrote
or
if
you
like
stuff
the
poets
wrote
and
their
intelligence
tells
them
of
course
that
anyone
who
in
the
simple
proposition
wrote
poetry
connects
an
object
with
a
subject
by
a
verb
does
not
at
any
rate
intend
to
sunder
what
he
has
just
been
at
pains
however
slight
to
join
together
he
may
at
least
have
the
credit
whether
he
be
right
or
wrong
of
asserting
his
subject
and
his
object
to
be
interdependent
take
a
particular
proposition
john
milton
wrote
a
poem
called
paradise
lost
you
will
hardly
contest
the
truth
of
that
but
what
does
it
mean
milton
wrote
the
story
of
the
fall
of
man
he
told
it
in
some
thousands
of
lines
of
decasyllabic
verse
unrhymed
he
measured
these
lines
out
with
exquisite
cadences
the
object
of
our
simple
sentence
includes
all
these
and
this
much
beside
that
he
wrote
the
total
poem
and
made
it
what
it
is
nor
can
that
object
be
fully
understood
literature
being
ever
and
always
so
personal
a
thing
until
we
understand
the
subject
john
milton
what
manner
of
man
he
was
and
how
on
earth
being
such
a
man
he
contrived
to
do
it
we
shall
never
know
that
but
it
is
important
we
should
get
as
near
as
we
can
of
the
bible
this
is
yet
more
evident
it
being
a
translation
isaiah
did
not
write
the
cadences
of
his
prophecies
as
we
ordinary
men
of
this
country
know
them
christ
did
not
speak
the
cadences
of
the
parables
or
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
as
we
know
them
these
have
been
supplied
by
the
translators
by
all
means
let
us
study
them
and
learn
to
delight
in
them
but
christ
did
not
suffer
for
his
cadences
still
less
for
the
cadences
invented
by
englishmen
almost
years
later
and
englishmen
who
went
to
the
stake
did
not
die
for
these
cadences
they
were
lollards
and
reformers
who
lived
too
soon
to
have
heard
them
they
were
catholics
of
the
profession
who
had
either
never
heard
or
having
heard
abhorred
them
these
men
were
cheerful
to
die
for
the
of
the
word
and
for
its
because
it
was
spoken
by
christ
iii
there
is
in
fact
gentlemen
no
such
thing
as
literature
pedants
have
coined
that
contemptuous
term
to
express
a
figmentary
concept
of
their
own
imagination
or
to
be
more
accurate
an
hallucination
of
wrath
having
about
as
much
likeness
to
a
as
had
the
doll
which
if
you
remember
maggie
tulliver
used
to
beat
in
the
garret
whenever
poor
child
the
world
went
wrong
with
her
somehow
the
thoughts
actions
and
passions
of
men
became
literature
by
the
simple
but
difficult
process
of
being
recorded
in
memorable
speech
but
in
that
process
neither
the
real
thing
recorded
nor
the
author
is
evacuated
lettres
fine
are
odious
terms
for
which
no
man
has
any
use
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
world
as
if
there
were
it
would
deserve
the
name
as
for
art
the
late
professor
butcher
bequeathed
to
us
a
translation
of
aristotle
poetics
with
some
admirable
appendixes
the
whole
entitled
aristotle
theory
of
poetry
and
fine
art
aristotle
never
in
his
life
had
a
theory
of
fine
art
as
distinct
from
other
art
nor
i
wager
can
you
find
in
his
discovered
works
a
word
for
any
such
thing
now
if
aristotle
had
a
concept
of
art
as
distinguished
from
other
art
he
was
man
enough
to
find
a
name
for
it
his
omission
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
speaks
for
itself
so
you
should
beware
of
any
teacher
who
would
treat
the
bible
or
any
part
of
it
as
writing
mere
literature
iv
let
me
having
said
this
at
once
enter
a
a
qualification
although
men
do
not
go
to
the
stake
for
the
cadences
the
phrases
of
our
authorised
version
it
remains
true
that
these
cadences
these
phrases
have
for
three
hundred
years
exercised
a
most
powerful
effect
upon
their
emotions
they
do
so
by
association
of
ideas
by
the
accreted
memories
of
our
race
enwrapping
connotation
around
a
word
a
name
say
the
name
or
the
name
and
they
that
wasted
us
required
of
us
mirth
saying
sing
us
one
of
the
songs
of
sion
how
shall
we
sing
the
lord
song
in
a
strange
land
if
i
forget
thee
o
jerusalem
let
my
right
hand
forget
her
cunning
it
must
be
known
to
you
gentlemen
that
these
words
can
affect
men
to
tears
who
never
connect
them
in
thought
with
the
actual
geographical
jerusalem
who
connect
it
in
thought
merely
with
a
quite
different
native
home
from
which
they
are
exiles
here
and
there
some
one
man
may
feel
a
similar
emotion
over
tanagra
think
not
i
forget
but
the
word
jerusalem
will
strike
twenty
men
twentyfold
more
poignantly
for
to
each
it
names
the
city
familiar
in
spirit
to
his
parents
when
they
knelt
and
to
their
fathers
before
them
not
only
the
city
which
was
his
nursery
and
yet
lay
just
beyond
the
landscape
seen
from
its
window
its
connotation
includes
not
only
what
the
word
has
meant
and
ever
must
mean
to
thousands
on
thousands
setting
eyes
for
the
first
time
on
but
it
holds
too
some
hint
of
the
new
jerusalem
the
city
of
twelve
gates
before
the
vision
of
which
st
john
fell
prone
ah
my
sweet
home
hierusalem
would
god
i
were
in
thee
thy
gardens
and
thy
gallant
walks
continually
are
green
there
grows
such
sweet
and
pleasant
flowers
as
nowhere
else
are
seen
quite
through
the
streets
with
pleasant
sound
the
flood
of
life
doth
flow
upon
whose
banks
on
every
side
the
wood
of
life
doth
grow
our
lady
sings
magnificat
with
tones
surpassing
sweet
and
all
the
virgins
bear
their
part
sitting
about
her
feet
hierusalem
my
happy
home
would
god
i
were
in
thee
would
god
my
woes
were
at
an
end
thy
joys
that
i
might
see
you
can
not
i
say
get
away
from
these
connotations
accreted
through
your
own
memories
and
your
fathers
as
neither
can
you
be
sure
of
getting
free
of
any
great
literature
in
any
tongue
once
it
has
been
written
let
me
quote
you
a
passage
from
cardinal
newman
he
is
addressing
the
undergraduates
of
the
catholic
university
of
dublin
how
real
a
creation
how
generis
is
the
style
of
shakespeare
or
of
the
protestant
bible
and
prayer
book
or
of
swift
or
of
pope
or
of
gibbon
or
of
johnson
i
pause
to
mark
how
just
this
man
can
be
to
his
great
enemies
pope
was
a
roman
catholic
you
will
remember
but
gibbon
was
an
infidel
even
were
the
without
meaning
though
in
truth
the
style
can
not
really
be
abstracted
from
the
sense
still
the
style
would
on
supposition
remain
as
perfect
and
original
a
work
as
euclid
elements
or
a
symphony
of
beethoven
and
like
music
it
has
seized
upon
the
public
mind
and
the
literature
of
england
is
no
longer
a
mere
letter
printed
in
books
and
shut
up
in
libraries
but
it
is
a
living
voice
which
has
gone
forth
in
its
expressions
and
its
sentiments
into
the
world
of
men
which
daily
thrills
upon
our
ears
and
syllables
our
thoughts
which
speaks
to
us
through
our
correspondents
and
dictates
when
we
put
pen
to
paper
whether
we
will
or
no
the
phraseology
of
shakespeare
of
the
protestant
formularies
of
milton
of
pope
of
johnson
and
of
walter
scott
have
become
a
portion
of
the
vernacular
tongue
the
household
words
of
which
perhaps
we
little
guess
the
origin
and
the
very
idioms
of
our
familiar
conversation
so
tyrannous
is
the
literature
of
a
nation
it
is
too
much
for
us
we
can
not
destroy
or
reverse
it
we
can
not
make
it
over
again
it
is
a
great
work
of
man
when
it
is
no
work
of
god
we
can
not
undo
the
past
english
literature
will
ever
protestant
v
i
am
speaking
then
to
hearers
who
would
read
not
to
contradict
and
confute
who
have
an
inherited
sense
of
the
english
bible
and
who
have
even
as
i
a
store
of
associated
ideas
to
be
evoked
by
any
chance
phrase
from
it
beyond
this
it
may
be
nothing
that
can
be
called
scholarship
by
any
stretch
of
the
term
very
well
then
my
first
piece
of
advice
reading
the
is
that
you
do
it
i
have
of
course
no
reason
at
all
to
suppose
or
suggest
that
any
member
of
this
present
audience
omits
to
do
it
but
some
general
observations
are
permitted
to
an
occupant
of
this
chair
and
speaking
generally
and
as
one
not
constitutionally
disposed
to
lamentation
in
the
book
we
are
discussing
for
example
i
find
jeremiah
the
contributor
least
to
my
mind
i
do
believe
that
the
young
read
the
bible
less
and
enjoy
it
less
probably
read
it
less
because
they
enjoy
it
less
than
their
fathers
did
the
education
act
of
often
in
these
days
too
sweepingly
denounced
did
a
vast
deal
of
good
along
with
no
small
amount
of
definite
harm
at
the
head
of
the
harmful
effects
must
i
think
be
set
its
discouragement
of
bible
reading
and
this
chiefly
through
its
encouraging
parents
to
believe
that
they
could
henceforth
hand
over
the
training
of
their
children
to
the
state
lock
stock
and
barrel
you
all
remember
the
picture
in
burns
of
the
cotter
saturday
night
the
chearfu
supper
done
wi
serious
face
they
round
the
ingle
form
a
circle
wide
the
sire
turns
wi
patriarchal
grace
the
big
ance
his
father
pride
his
bonnet
is
laid
aside
his
lyart
haffets
wearing
thin
and
bare
those
strains
that
once
did
sweet
in
zion
glide
he
wales
a
portion
with
judicious
care
and
us
worship
god
he
says
with
solemn
air
but
you
know
that
the
sire
bred
on
the
tradition
of
and
now
growing
grey
does
nothing
of
that
sort
on
a
saturday
night
that
saturday
being
he
inclines
rather
to
order
the
children
into
the
to
get
washed
that
on
sunday
morning
having
seen
them
off
to
a
place
of
worship
he
inclines
to
sit
down
and
read
in
place
of
the
bible
his
sunday
newspaper
that
in
the
afternoon
he
again
shunts
them
off
to
now
to
speak
first
of
the
children
it
is
good
for
them
to
be
tubbed
on
saturday
night
good
for
them
also
i
dare
say
to
attend
on
the
following
afternoon
but
not
good
in
so
far
as
they
miss
to
hear
the
bible
read
by
their
parents
and
pure
religion
breathing
household
laws
religion
well
perhaps
that
begs
the
question
and
i
dare
say
burns
cotter
when
he
waled
portion
with
judicious
care
waled
it
as
often
as
not
perhaps
oftener
than
not
to
contradict
and
confute
that
often
he
contradicted
and
confuted
very
crudely
very
ignorantly
but
we
may
call
it
simple
religion
anyhow
sincere
religion
parental
religion
household
religion
and
for
a
certainty
no
in
or
have
for
tingeing
a
child
mind
an
effect
comparable
with
that
of
a
religion
pervading
the
child
home
present
at
bedside
and
board
here
a
little
child
i
stand
heaving
up
my
either
hand
cold
as
paddocks
the
they
be
here
i
lift
them
up
to
thee
for
a
benison
to
fall
on
our
meat
and
on
us
all
amen
permeating
the
house
subtly
instilled
by
the
very
accent
of
his
father
and
his
mother
speech
for
the
grown
man
i
happen
to
come
from
a
part
of
england
ed
cornwall
where
men
in
all
my
days
have
been
curiously
concerned
with
religion
and
are
yet
so
concerned
so
much
that
you
can
scarce
take
up
a
local
paper
and
turn
to
the
correspondence
column
but
you
will
find
some
heated
controversy

in

of

the
jargon
of

yellow

which
does
not
tend
to
clear
definition
on
points
of
theology
the
mass
of
all
this
controversial
stuff
is
no
more
absurd
no
more
frantic
than
it
used
to
be
but
in
language
it
has
lost
its
dignity
with
its
homeliness
it
has
lost
the
colouring
of
the
scriptures
the
intonation
of
the
scriptures
the
scriptural
if
i
turn
from
it
to
a
passage
in
bunyan
i
am
conversing
with
a
man
who
though
he
has
read
few
other
books
has
imbibed
and
soaked
the
authorised
version
into
his
fibres
so
that
he
can
not
speak
but
biblically
listen
to
this
as
to
the
situation
of
this
town
it
lieth
just
between
the
two
worlds
and
the
first
founder
and
builder
of
it
so
far
as
by
the
best
and
most
authentic
records
i
can
gather
was
one
shaddai
and
he
built
it
for
his
own
delight
he
made
it
the
mirror
and
glory
of
all
that
he
made
even
the
beyond
anything
else
that
he
did
in
that
country
yea
so
goodly
a
town
was
mansoul
when
first
built
that
it
is
said
by
some
the
gods
at
the
setting
up
thereof
came
down
to
see
it
and
sang
for
joy
the
wall
of
the
town
was
well
built
yea
so
fast
and
firm
was
it
knit
and
compact
together
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
townsmen
themselves
they
could
not
have
been
shaken
or
broken
for
ever
or
take
this
now
as
they
were
going
along
and
talking
they
espied
a
boy
feeding
his
father
sheep
the
boy
was
in
very
mean
cloaths
but
of
a
very
fresh
and
countenance
and
as
he
sate
by
himself
he
sung
then
said
their
guide
do
you
hear
him
i
will
dare
to
say
that
this
boy
lives
a
merrier
life
and
wears
more
of
that
herb
called
in
his
bosom
than
he
that
is
clad
in
silk
and
velvet
i
choose
ordinary
passages
not
solemn
ones
in
which
bunyan
is
consciously
scriptural
but
you
can
not
miss
the
accent
that
is
bunyan
of
course
and
i
am
far
from
saying
that
the
labouring
men
among
whom
i
grew
up
at
the
fishery
or
in
the
hayfield
talked
with
bunyan
magic
but
i
do
assert
that
they
had
something
of
the
accent
enough
to
be
in
a
mind
the
fishermen
and
labourers
among
whom
christ
found
his
first
disciples
they
had
the
large
simplicity
of
speech
the
cadence
the
accent
but
let
me
turn
to
ireland
where
though
not
directly
derived
from
our
english
bible
a
similar
scriptural
accent
survives
among
the
peasantry
and
is
i
hope
ineradicable
i
choose
two
sentences
from
a
book
of
recently
written
by
the
survivor
of
the
two
ladies
who
together
wrote
the
incomparable
the
first
was
uttered
by
a
small
cultivator
who
was
asked
why
his
had
failed
could
hardly
say
was
the
answer
it
was
god
spurned
them
in
a
boggy
place
is
that
not
the
accent
of
isaiah
he
will
surely
violently
turn
and
toss
thee
like
a
ball
into
a
large
country
the
other
is
the
benediction
bestowed
upon
the
late
miss
violet
martin
by
a
in
skibbereen
sure
ye
always
laughing
that
ye
may
laugh
in
the
sight
of
the
glory
of
heaven
vi
but
one
now
sees
or
seems
to
see
that
we
children
did
in
our
time
read
the
bible
a
great
deal
if
perforce
we
were
taught
to
read
it
in
sundry
bad
ways
of
which
perhaps
the
worst
was
that
our
elders
hammered
in
all
the
books
all
the
parts
of
it
as
equally
inspired
and
therefore
equivalent
of
course
this
meant
among
other
things
that
they
hammered
it
all
in
literally
but
let
us
not
sentimentalise
over
that
it
really
did
no
child
any
harm
to
believe
that
the
universe
was
created
in
a
working
week
of
six
days
and
that
god
sat
down
and
looked
at
it
on
sunday
and
behold
it
was
very
good
a
week
is
quite
a
long
while
to
a
child
yet
a
definite
division
rounding
off
a
square
job
the
at
home
usually
for
some
unexplained
reason
went
wrong
during
the
the
plumber
came
in
on
monday
and
carried
out
his
tools
on
saturday
at
these
little
analogies
really
do
i
believe
help
the
infant
mind
and
not
at
all
to
its
later
detriment
nor
shall
i
ask
you
to
sentimentalise
overmuch
upon
the
harm
done
to
a
child
by
teaching
him
that
the
bloodthirsty
jealous
jehovah
of
the
book
of
joshua
is
as
venerable
being
one
and
the
same
unalterably
whom
is
no
variableness
neither
shadow
of
turning
as
the
father
same
lord
whose
property
is
always
to
have
mercy
revealed
to
us
in
the
gospel
invoked
for
us
at
the
eucharist
i
do
most
seriously
hold
it
to
be
fatal
if
we
grow
up
and
are
fossilised
in
any
such
belief
where
have
we
better
proof
than
in
the
invocations
which
the
family
of
the
hohenzollerns
have
been
putting
up
any
time
since
august
and
for
years
before
to
this
bloody
identification
of
the
christian
man
god
with
joshua
my
simple
advice
is
that
you
not
only
read
the
bible
early
but
read
it
again
and
again
and
if
on
the
third
or
fifth
reading
it
leave
you
just
where
the
first
left
you
if
you
still
get
from
it
no
historical
sense
of
a
race
its
concept
of
god
well
then
the
point
of
the
advice
is
lost
and
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
but
over
this
business
of
teaching
the
book
of
joshua
to
children
i
am
in
some
doubt
a
few
years
ago
an
education
committee
of
which
i
happened
to
be
chairman
sent
ministers
of
religion
about
two
by
two
to
test
the
religious
instruction
given
in
elementary
schools
of
the
two
who
worked
around
my
immediate
neighbourhood
one
was
a
young
priest
of
the
church
of
england
a
medievalist
with
an
ardent
passion
for
ritual
the
other
a
gentle
congregational
minister
a
mere
holy
and
humble
man
of
heart
they
became
great
friends
in
the
course
of
these
expeditions
and
they
brought
back
this
report
is
positively
wicked
to
let
these
children
grow
up
being
taught
that
there
is
no
difference
in
value
between
joshua
and
st
matthew
that
the
god
of
the
lord
prayer
is
the
same
who
commanded
the
massacre
of
ai
well
perhaps
it
is
seeing
how
bloodthirsty
old
men
can
be
in
these
days
one
is
tempted
to
think
that
they
can
hardly
be
caught
too
young
and
taught
decency
if
not
mansuetude
but
i
do
not
remember
as
a
child
feeling
any
horror
about
it
or
any
difficulty
in
reconciling
the
two
concepts
children
a
bit
bloodthirsty
and
i
observe
that
two
volumes
of
the
late
captain
mayne
reid
the
rifle
rangers
and
the
scalp
hunters
have
just
found
their
way
into
the
world
classics
and
are
advertised
alongside
of
ruskin
sesame
and
lilies
and
the
de
imitatione
christi
i
leave
you
to
think
this
out
adding
but
this
for
a
suggestion
that
as
the
hebrew
outgrew
his
primitive
tribal
beliefs
so
the
bettering
mind
of
man
casts
off
the
old
clouts
of
primitive
doctrine
he
being
in
fact
better
than
his
religion
you
have
all
heard
preachers
trying
to
show
that
jacob
was
a
better
fellow
than
esau
somehow
you
have
all
i
hope
rejected
every
such
explanation
esau
was
a
gentleman
jacob
was
not
the
instinct
of
a
young
man
meets
that
wall
and
there
is
no
passing
it
later
the
mind
of
the
youth
perceives
that
the
writer
of
jacob
history
has
a
tribal
mind
and
supposes
throughout
that
for
the
advancement
of
his
tribe
many
things
are
permissible
and
even
admirable
which
a
later
and
urbaner
mind
rejects
as
detestably
sharp
practice
and
the
story
of
jacob
becomes
the
more
valuable
to
us
historically
as
we
realise
what
a
hero
he
is
to
the
bland
chronicler
vii
but
of
another
thing
gentlemen
i
am
certain
that
we
were
badly
taught
in
that
these
books
while
preached
to
us
as
equivalent
were
kept
in
separate
compartments
we
were
taught
the
books
of
kings
and
chronicles
as
history
the
prophets
were
the
prophets
inspired
men
predicting
the
future
which
they
only
did
by
chance
as
every
inspired
man
does
isaiah
was
never
put
into
relation
with
his
time
at
all
which
means
everything
to
our
understanding
of
isaiah
whether
of
jerusalem
or
of
babylon
we
ploughed
through
kings
and
chronicles
and
made
out
lists
of
rulers
with
dates
and
capital
events
isaiah
was
all
fine
writing
about
nothing
at
all
and
historically
we
were
concerned
with
him
only
to
verify
some
reference
to
the
messiah
in
this
or
that
evangelist
but
there
is
not
never
has
been
really
fine
literature
like
isaiah
composed
about
nothing
at
all
and
in
the
mere
matter
of
prognostication
i
doubt
if
such
experts
as
zadkiel
and
old
moore
have
anything
to
fear
from
any
school
of
writing
we
can
build
up
in
cambridge
but
if
we
had
only
been
taught
to
read
isaiah
concurrently
with
the
books
of
the
kings
what
a
fire
it
would
have
kindled
among
the
dry
bones
of
our
studies
then
said
the
lord
unto
isaiah
go
forth
now
to
meet
ahaz
thou
and
thy
son
at
the
end
of
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
in
the
highway
of
the
field
scholars
of
course
know
the
political
significance
of
that
famous
meeting
but
if
we
had
only
known
it
if
we
had
only
been
taught
what
assyria
was
with
its
successive
monarchs
pileser
shalmaneser
sargon
sennacherib
and
why
syria
and
israel
and
egypt
were
trying
to
cajole
or
force
judah
into
alliance
what
a
difference
i
say
this
passage
would
have
meant
to
us
viii
i
daresay
after
all
that
the
best
way
is
not
to
bother
a
boy
too
early
and
overmuch
with
history
that
the
best
way
is
to
let
him
ramp
at
first
through
the
scriptures
even
as
he
might
through
the
arabian
nights
to
let
him
take
the
books
as
they
come
merely
indicating
for
instance
that
job
is
a
great
poem
the
psalms
great
lyrics
the
story
of
ruth
a
lovely
idyll
the
song
of
songs
the
perfection
of
an
eastern
well
and
what
then
he
will
certainly
get
less
of
the
cotter
saturday
night
into
it
and
certainly
more
of
the
truth
of
the
east
there
he
will
feel
the
whole
splendid
barbaric
story
for
himself
the
flocks
of
abraham
and
laban
the
trek
of
jacob
sons
to
egypt
for
corn
the
figures
of
rebekah
at
the
well
ruth
at
the
gleaning
and
rispah
beneath
the
gibbet
sisera
bowing
in
weariness
saul
great
saul
by
the
with
the
jewels
in
his
turban
all
its
lordly
and
rubies
courageous
at
heart
or
consider
to
choose
one
or
two
pictures
out
of
the
tremendous
procession
consider
michal
saul
royal
daughter
how
first
she
is
given
in
marriage
to
david
to
be
a
snare
for
him
how
loving
him
she
saves
his
life
letting
him
down
from
the
window
and
dressing
up
an
image
on
the
bed
in
his
place
how
later
she
is
handed
over
to
another
husband
phaltiel
how
david
demands
her
back
and
she
goes
and
her
husband
phaltiel
went
with
her
along
weeping
behind
her
to
bahurim
then
said
abner
unto
him
go
return
and
he
returned
or
still
later
how
the
revulsion
takes
her
saul
daughter
as
she
sees
david
capering
home
before
the
ark
and
how
her
affection
had
done
with
this
emotional
man
of
the
ruddy
countenance
so
prone
to
weep
in
his
bed
and
as
the
ark
of
the
lord
came
into
the
city
of
david
michal
saul
daughter
mark
the
three
words
michal
saul
daughter
looked
through
a
window
and
saw
king
david
leaping
and
dancing
before
the
lord
and
she
despised
him
in
her
heart
the
whole
story
goes
into
about
ten
lines
your
psychological
novelist
nowadays
given
the
wit
to
invent
it
would
make
it
cover
pages
at
least
or
take
the
end
of
david
in
the
first
two
chapters
of
the
first
book
of
kings
with
its
tale
of
oriental
intrigues
plots
treacheries
murderings
in
the
depths
of
the
horrible
palace
wherein
the
old
man
is
dying
or
read
of
solomon
and
his
ships
and
his
builders
and
see
his
temple
growing
as
heber
put
it
like
a
tall
palm
with
no
sound
of
hammers
or
read
again
the
end
of
queen
athaliah
and
when
athaliah
heard
the
noise
of
the
guard
and
of
the
people
she
came
to
the
people
into
the
temple
of
the
and
when
she
looked
behold
the
king
stood
by
a
pillar
as
the
manner
was
and
the
princes
and
the
trumpeters
by
the
king
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
blew
with
trumpets
and
athaliah
rent
her
clothes
and
cried
treason
but
jehoiada
the
priest
commanded
the
captains
of
the
hundreds
the
officers
of
the
host
and
said
unto
them
have
her
forth
without
the
ranges
and
they
laid
hands
on
her
and
she
went
by
the
way
by
the
which
the
horses
came
into
the
king
house
and
there
was
she
slain
let
a
youngster
read
this
i
say
just
as
it
is
written
and
how
the
true
east
sound
scent
form
colour
pours
into
the
narrative
cymbals
and
trumpets
leagues
of
sand
caravans
trailing
through
the
heat
priest
and
soldiery
and
kings
going
up
between
them
to
the
altar
blood
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
blood
everywhere
smell
of
blood
mingled
with
spices
dung
of
camels
yes
but
how
if
you
will
permit
the
word
how
the
of
it
as
magnificent
literature
might
be
enhanced
by
a
scholar
who
would
condescend
to
whisper
of
his
knowledge
the
magical
word
here
or
there
to
the
child
as
he
reads
for
an
no
child
no
grown
man
with
any
sense
of
poetry
can
deny
his
ear
to
the
psalm
the
one
that
begins
heart
is
inditing
a
good
matter
and
plunges
into
a
hymn
of
royal
nuptials
first
you
remember
the
the
sons
of
korah
lift
their
chant
to
the
bridegroom
the
king
gird
thy
sword
upon
thy
thigh
o
most
mighty
and
in
thy
majesty
ride
prosperously
or
as
we
hear
it
in
the
book
of
common
prayer
good
luck
have
thou
with
thine
honour
because
of
the
word
of
truth
of
meekness
and
righteousness
and
thy
right
hand
shall
teach
thee
terrible
things
all
thy
garments
smell
of
myrrh
aloes
and
cassia
out
of
the
ivory
palaces
whereby
they
have
made
thee
glad
anon
they
turn
to
the
bride
hearken
o
daughter
and
consider
and
incline
thine
ear
forget
also
thine
own
people
and
thy
father
house
the
king
daughter
is
all
glorious
within
her
clothing
is
of
wrought
gold
she
shall
be
brought
unto
the
king
in
raiment
of
needlework
the
virgins
that
be
her
fellows
shall
bear
her
company
and
the
daughter
of
tyre
shall
be
there
with
a
gift
instead
of
thy
fathers
shall
be
thy
children
whom
thou
mayest
make
princes
in
all
the
earth
for
whom
wonders
the
young
reader
by
this
for
what
happy
bride
and
bridegroom
was
this
glorious
chant
raised
now
suppose
that
just
here
he
has
a
scholar
ready
to
tell
him
what
is
likeliest
true
that
the
bridegroom
was
ahab
that
the
bride
the
daughter
of
sidon
was
no
other
than
jezebel
and
became
what
jezebel
now
is
with
what
an
awe
of
surmise
would
two
other
passages
of
the
history
toll
on
his
ear
and
one
washed
the
chariot
in
the
pool
of
samaria
and
the
dogs
licked
up
his
blood
and
when
he
jehu
was
come
in
he
did
eat
and
drink
and
said
go
see
now
this
cursed
woman
and
bury
her
for
she
is
a
king
daughter
and
they
went
to
bury
her
but
they
found
no
more
of
her
than
the
skull
and
the
feet
and
the
palms
of
her
hands
wherefore
they
came
again
and
told
him
and
he
said
this
is
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
elijah
the
tishbite
saying
in
the
portion
of
jezreel
shall
dogs
eat
the
flesh
of
jezebel
so
that
men
shall
not
say
this
is
jezebel
in
another
lecture
gentlemen
i
propose
to
take
up
the
argument
and
attempt
to
bring
it
to
this
point
can
we
having
this
incomparable
work
for
study
by
all
who
would
write
english
bring
it
within
the
ambit
of
the
english
tripos
and
yet
avoid
offending
the
experts
lecture
ix
on
reading
the
bible
ii
wednesday
april
i
we
left
off
last
term
gentlemen
upon
a
note
of
protest
we
wondered
why
it
should
be
that
our
english
version
of
the
bible
lies
under
the
ban
of
boards
of
studies
and
all
who
devise
courses
of
reading
and
examinations
in
english
literature
that
among
our
books
we
find
prologue
we
find
hamlet
we
find
paradise
lost
we
find
pope
essay
on
man
again
and
again
but
the
book
of
job
never
the
vicar
of
wakefield
and
gray
elegy
often
but
ruth
or
isaiah
ecclesiasticus
or
wisdom
never
i
propose
this
morning
to
enquire
into
the
reasons
for
this
so
far
as
i
can
guess
and
interpret
them
to
deal
with
such
reasons
as
we
can
discover
or
surmise
to
suggest
some
simple
first
aid
and
in
another
lecture
taking
for
experiment
a
single
book
from
the
authorised
version
some
practical
ways
of
including
it
in
the
ambit
of
our
new
english
tripos
this
will
compel
me
to
be
definite
and
as
definite
proposals
invite
definite
objections
by
this
method
we
are
likeliest
to
know
where
we
are
and
if
the
reform
we
seek
be
realisable
or
illusory
ii
i
shall
ask
you
then
first
to
assent
with
me
that
the
authorised
version
of
the
holy
bible
is
as
a
literary
achievement
one
of
the
greatest
in
our
language
nay
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
complete
works
of
shakespeare
the
very
greatest
you
will
certainly
not
deny
this
as
little
or
less
will
you
deny
that
more
deeply
than
any
other
book
more
deeply
even
than
all
the
writings
of
shakespeare
far
more
deeply
it
has
influenced
our
literature
here
let
me
repeat
a
short
passage
from
a
former
lecture
of
mine
may
five
years
ago
i
had
quoted
some
few
glorious
sentences
such
as
thine
eyes
shall
see
the
king
in
his
beauty
they
shall
behold
the
land
that
is
very
far
off
and
a
man
shall
be
as
an
from
the
wind
and
a
covert
from
the
tempest
as
rivers
of
water
in
a
dry
place
as
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
so
when
this
corruptible
shall
have
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
shall
have
put
on
immortality
and
having
quoted
these
i
went
on
when
a
nation
has
achieved
this
manner
of
diction
these
rhythms
for
its
dearest
beliefs
a
literature
is
surely
established
wyclif
tyndale
coverdale
and
others
before
the
had
wrought
the
authorised
version
setting
a
seal
on
all
set
a
seal
on
our
national
style
it
has
cadences
homely
and
sublime
yet
so
harmonises
them
that
the
voice
is
always
one
simple
men
holy
and
humble
men
of
heart
like
isaak
walton
and
bunyan
have
their
lips
touched
and
speak
to
the
homelier
tune
proud
men
scholars
milton
sir
thomas
browne
practise
the
rolling
latin
sentence
but
upon
the
rhythms
of
our
bible
they
too
fall
back
great
mutations
of
the
world
are
acted
or
time
may
be
too
short
for
our
designs
thyself
with
the
choragium
of
the
stars
is
nothing
immortal
but
immortality
the
precise
man
addison
can
not
excel
one
parable
in
brevity
or
in
heavenly
clarity
the
two
parts
of
antithesis
come
to
no
more
than
this
lord
has
gone
up
to
the
sound
of
a
trump
with
the
sound
of
a
trump
our
lord
has
gone
up
the
bible
controls
its
enemy
gibbon
as
surely
as
it
haunts
the
curious
music
of
a
light
sentence
of
thackeray
it
is
in
everything
we
see
hear
feel
because
it
is
in
us
in
our
blood
if
that
be
true
or
less
than
gravely
overstated
if
the
english
bible
hold
this
unique
place
in
our
literature
if
it
be
at
once
a
monument
an
example
and
best
of
all
a
well
of
english
undefiled
no
stagnant
water
but
quick
running
curative
refreshing
vivifying
may
we
not
agree
gentlemen
to
require
the
weightiest
reason
why
our
instructors
should
continue
to
hedge
in
the
temple
and
pipe
the
fountain
off
in
professional
conduits
forbidding
it
to
irrigate
freely
our
ground
of
study
it
is
done
so
complacently
that
i
do
not
remember
to
have
met
one
single
argument
put
up
in
defence
of
it
and
so
i
am
reduced
to
what
can
be
the
justifying
reason
for
an
embargo
on
the
face
of
it
so
silly
and
arbitrary
if
not
senseless
iii
does
it
reside
perchance
in
some
primitive
instinct
of
of
a
superstition
of
fencing
off
sacred
things
as
unmentionable
and
reinforced
by
the
bad
puritan
notion
that
holy
things
are
by
no
means
to
be
enjoyed
if
so
i
begin
by
referring
you
to
the
greeks
and
their
attitude
towards
the
homeric
poems
we
of
course
hold
the
old
testament
more
sacred
than
homer
but
i
very
much
doubt
if
it
be
more
sacred
to
us
than
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
were
to
an
old
athenian
in
his
day
to
the
greeks
and
to
forget
this
is
the
fruitfullest
source
of
error
in
dealing
with
the
tragedians
or
even
with
aristophanes
to
the
greeks
their
religion
such
as
it
was
mattered
enormously
they
built
their
theatre
upon
it
as
we
most
certainly
do
not
which
means
that
it
had
sunk
into
their
daily
life
and
permeated
their
enjoyment
of
it
as
our
religion
certainly
does
not
affect
life
to
enhance
it
as
amusing
or
pleasurable
we
go
to
church
on
sunday
and
write
it
off
as
an
observance
but
if
eager
to
be
happy
with
a
free
heart
we
close
early
and
steal
a
few
hours
from
the
we
antagonise
religion
and
enjoyment
worship
and
holiday
nature
being
too
strong
for
any
convention
of
ours
courtship
has
asserted
itself
as
permissible
on
the
sabbath
if
not
as
a
sabbatical
institution
now
the
greeks
were
just
as
much
slaves
to
the
letter
of
their
homer
as
any
auld
licht
elder
to
the
letter
of
st
paul
no
one
will
accuse
plato
of
being
overfriendly
to
poetry
yet
i
believe
you
will
find
in
plato
some
direct
citations
from
homer
not
to
speak
of
allusions
scattered
broadcast
through
the
dialogues
often
as
texts
for
long
argument
of
these
citations
and
allusions
an
inordinate
number
seem
to
us
laboriously
trivial
that
is
to
say
unless
we
put
ourselves
into
the
hellenic
mind
on
the
other
hand
plato
uses
others
to
enforce
or
illustrate
his
profoundest
doctrines
for
an
instance
in
phaedo
socrates
is
arguing
that
the
soul
can
not
be
one
with
the
harmony
of
the
bodily
affections
being
herself
the
who
commands
the
strings
almost
always
he
says
opposing
and
coercing
them
in
all
sorts
of
ways
throughout
life
sometimes
more
violently
with
the
pains
of
medicine
and
gymnastic
then
again
more
gently
threatening
and
also
reprimanding
the
desires
passions
fears
as
if
talking
to
a
thing
which
is
not
herself
as
homer
in
the
odyssey
represents
odysseus
doing
in
the
words
greek
stethos
de
plexas
kradien
enipape
mutho
tetlathi
de
kradie
kai
kynteron
allo
pot
etles
he
beat
his
breast
and
thus
reproached
his
heart
endure
my
heart
far
worse
hast
thou
endured
do
you
think
asks
socrates
that
homer
wrote
this
under
the
idea
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
capable
of
being
led
by
the
affections
of
the
body
and
not
rather
of
a
nature
which
should
lead
and
master
them
herself
a
far
diviner
thing
than
any
harmony
a
greek
then
will
use
homer
bible
minutely
on
niceties
of
conduct
or
broadly
on
first
principles
of
philosophy
or
religion
but
equally
since
it
is
poetry
all
the
time
to
him
he
will
take
or
to
instance
particular
writers
aristotle
and
the
late
greek
longinus
will
take
a
single
hexameter
to
illustrate
a
minute
trick
of
style
or
turn
of
phrase
as
equally
he
will
choose
a
long
passage
or
the
whole
iliad
the
whole
odyssey
to
illustrate
a
grand
rule
of
poetic
construction
a
first
principle
of
aesthetics
for
an
example
says
aristotle
starting
to
show
that
an
epic
poem
must
have
unity
of
subject
to
repeat
what
we
have
said
before
we
have
a
further
proof
of
homer
superiority
to
the
rest
he
did
not
attempt
to
deal
even
with
the
trojan
war
in
its
entirety
though
it
was
a
whole
story
with
a
definite
beginning
middle
and
end
feeling
apparently
that
it
was
too
long
a
story
to
be
taken
in
at
one
view
or
else
by
variety
of
incidents
and
as
aristotle
takes
the
iliad
bible
to
illustrate
a
grand
rule
of
poetical
construction
so
the
late
writer
of
his
tradition
longinus
will
use
it
to
exhibit
the
core
and
essence
of
poetical
sublimity
as
in
his
famous
ninth
chapter
of
which
gibbon
wrote
the
ninth
chapter
of
the
greek
peri
upsous
or
de
sublimitate
of
longinus
is
one
of
the
finest
monuments
of
antiquity
till
now
i
was
acquainted
only
with
two
ways
of
criticising
a
beautiful
passage
the
one
to
show
by
an
exact
anatomy
of
it
the
distinct
beauties
of
it
and
whence
they
sprung
the
other
an
idle
exclamation
or
a
general
encomium
which
leaves
nothing
behind
it
longinus
has
shown
me
that
there
is
a
third
he
tells
me
his
own
feelings
upon
reading
it
and
tells
them
with
so
much
energy
that
he
communicates
them
i
almost
doubt
which
is
more
sublime
homer
battle
of
the
gods
or
longinus
apostrophe
to
terentianus
upon
it
well
let
me
quote
you
in
translation
a
sentence
or
two
from
this
chapter
which
produced
upon
gibbon
such
an
effect
as
almost
to
anticipate
walter
pater
famous
definition
feel
the
virtue
of
the
poet
of
the
painter
to
disengage
it
to
set
it
forth
these
are
the
three
stages
of
the
critic
duty
says
longinus
have
written
as
follows
is
the
echo
of
a
great
is
the
echo
of
a
great
soul
it
was
worth
repeating
too
was
it
not
for
it
is
not
possible
that
men
with
mean
and
servile
ideas
and
aims
prevailing
throughout
their
lives
should
produce
anything
that
is
admirable
and
worthy
of
immortality
great
accents
we
expect
to
fall
from
the
lips
of
those
whose
thoughts
are
deep
and
grave
hear
how
magnificently
homer
speaks
of
the
higher
powers
far
as
a
man
seeth
with
his
eyes
into
the
haze
of
distance
as
he
sitteth
upon
a
cliff
of
outlook
and
gazeth
over
the
sea
even
so
far
at
a
bound
leap
the
neighing
horses
of
the
gods
makes
says
longinus
vastness
of
the
world
the
measure
of
their
leap
then
after
a
criticism
of
the
battle
of
the
gods
too
long
to
be
quoted
here
he
goes
on
much
superior
to
the
passages
respecting
the
battle
of
the
gods
are
those
which
represent
the
divine
nature
as
it
really
is
pure
and
great
and
undefiled
for
example
what
is
said
of
poseidon
her
ridges
her
quaked
in
dismay
and
her
peaks
and
the
trojans
town
and
the
ships
of
array
beneath
his
immortal
feet
as
onward
poseidon
strode
then
over
the
surges
he
drave
leapt
sporting
before
the
god
that
uprose
all
round
from
the
depths
for
their
king
they
knew
and
for
rapture
the
sea
was
disparted
and
onward
the
flew
then
how
does
longinus
conclude
why
very
strangely
very
strangely
indeed
whether
you
take
the
treatise
to
be
by
that
longinus
the
rhetorician
and
zenobia
adviser
whom
the
emperor
aurelian
put
to
death
or
prefer
to
believe
it
the
work
of
an
unknown
hand
in
the
first
century
the
treatise
goes
on
similarly
the
legislator
of
the
jews
moses
no
ordinary
man
having
formed
and
expressed
a
worthy
conception
of
the
might
of
the
godhead
writes
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
laws
said
what
there
be
light
and
there
was
iv
so
here
gentlemen
you
have
plato
aristotle
longinus
all
greeks
of
separate
states
men
of
eminence
all
three
and
two
of
surpassing
eminence
all
three
and
each
in
his
time
and
turn
treating
homer
reverently
as
holy
writ
and
yet
enjoying
it
liberally
as
poetry
for
indeed
the
true
greek
mind
had
no
thought
to
separate
poetry
from
religion
as
to
the
true
greek
mind
reverence
and
liberty
to
enjoy
with
the
liberty
of
mind
that
helps
to
enjoy
were
all
tributes
to
the
same
divine
thing
they
had
no
professionals
no
puritans
to
hedge
it
off
with
a
and
so
when
the
last
and
least
of
the
three
longinus
comes
to
holy
writ
the
sublime
poetry
in
which
christendom
reads
its
god
his
open
mind
at
once
recognises
it
as
poetry
and
as
sublime
said
let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
if
longinus
could
treat
this
as
sublime
poetry
why
can
not
we
who
have
translated
and
made
it
ours
v
are
we
forbidden
on
the
ground
that
our
bible
is
directly
inspired
well
inspiration
as
sir
william
davenant
observed
and
rather
wittily
proved
in
his
preface
to
gondibert
a
dangerous
term
it
is
dangerous
mainly
because
it
is
a
relative
term
a
term
of
degrees
you
may
say
definitely
of
some
things
that
the
writer
was
inspired
as
you
may
certify
a
certain
man
to
be
mad
that
is
so
thoroughly
and
convincingly
mad
that
you
can
order
him
under
restraint
but
quite
a
number
of
us
are
as
they
say
in
my
part
of
the
world
exactly
and
one
or
two
of
us
here
and
there
at
moments
may
have
a
touch
even
of
inspiration
so
of
the
bible
itself
i
suppose
that
few
nowadays
would
contend
it
to
be
all
inspired
you
may
say
all
equally
but
all
of
it
as
no
other
book
is
to
that
i
might
answer
do
you
that
direct
inspiration
ceased
with
the
revelation
of
st
john
the
divine
and
closed
the
book
it
may
be
but
how
do
you
know
and
what
authority
have
you
to
say
that
wordsworth
tintern
abbey
for
example
or
browning
great
invocation
of
love
was
not
directly
inspired
certainly
the
men
who
wrote
them
were
rapt
above
themselves
and
if
not
directly
why
indirectly
and
how
but
i
pause
on
the
edge
of
a
morass
and
spring
back
to
firmer
ground
our
bible
as
we
have
it
is
a
translation
made
by
men
and
published
in
the
year
the
original
and
i
am
still
on
firm
ground
because
i
am
quoting
now
from
the
cambridge
history
of
english
literature
proceeds
from
divine
inspiration
as
some
will
have
it
or
according
to
others
is
the
fruit
of
the
religious
genius
of
the
hebrew
race
from
either
point
of
view
the
authors
are
highly
gifted
individuals
highly
gifted
individuals
who
notwithstanding
their
diversities
and
the
progressiveness
observable
in
their
representations
of
the
nature
of
god
are
wonderfully
consistent
in
the
main
tenor
of
their
writings
and
serve
in
general
for
mutual
confirmation
and
illustration
in
some
cases
this
may
be
due
to
the
revision
of
earlier
productions
by
later
writers
which
has
thus
brought
more
primitive
conceptions
into
a
degree
of
conformity
with
maturer
and
profounder
views
but
even
in
such
cases
the
earlier
conception
often
lends
itself
without
wrenching
to
the
deeper
interpretation
and
the
completer
exposition
the
bible
is
not
distinctively
an
intellectual
achievement
in
all
earnest
i
protest
that
to
write
about
the
bible
in
such
a
fashion
is
to
demonstrate
inferentially
that
it
has
never
quickened
you
with
its
glow
that
whatever
your
learning
you
have
missed
what
the
unlearned
bunyan
for
example
so
admirably
caught
the
true
of
the
book
the
writer
to
be
sure
is
dealing
with
the
originals
let
us
more
humbly
sit
at
the
feet
of
the
translators
gifted
individuals
or
no
the
sort
of
thing
the
translators
wrote
was
god
said
let
there
be
light
sower
went
forth
to
sow
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
leaven
which
a
woman
took
wages
of
sin
is
death
trumpet
shall
sound
wept
is
swallowed
up
in
victory
let
me
quote
you
for
better
encouragement
as
well
as
for
relief
a
passage
from
matthew
arnold
on
the
authorised
version
the
effect
of
hebrew
poetry
can
be
preserved
and
transferred
in
a
foreign
language
as
the
effect
of
other
great
poetry
can
not
the
effect
of
homer
the
effect
of
dante
is
and
must
be
in
great
measure
lost
in
a
translation
because
their
poetry
is
a
poetry
of
metre
or
of
rhyme
or
both
and
the
effect
of
these
is
not
really
transferable
a
man
may
make
a
good
english
poem
with
the
matter
and
thoughts
of
homer
and
dante
may
even
try
to
reproduce
their
metre
or
rhyme
but
the
metre
and
rhyme
will
be
in
truth
his
own
and
the
effect
will
be
his
not
the
effect
of
homer
or
dante
isaiah
on
the
other
hand
is
a
poetry
as
is
well
known
of
parallelism
it
depends
not
on
metre
and
rhyme
but
on
a
balance
of
thought
conveyed
by
a
corresponding
balance
of
sentence
and
the
effect
of
this
can
be
transferred
to
another
language
hebrew
poetry
has
in
addition
the
effect
of
assonance
and
other
effects
which
can
not
perhaps
be
transferred
but
its
main
effect
its
effect
of
parallelism
of
thought
and
sentence
can
i
take
this
from
the
preface
to
his
little
volume
in
which
arnold
confesses
that
his
object
is
to
get
isaiah
enjoyed
vi
sundry
men
of
letters
besides
matthew
arnold
have
pleaded
for
a
literary
study
of
the
bible
and
specially
of
our
english
version
that
we
may
thereby
enhance
our
enjoyment
of
the
work
itself
and
through
this
enjoyment
and
understanding
of
the
rest
of
english
literature
from
down
specially
among
these
pleaders
let
me
mention
mr
now
lord
latymer
and
a
cambridge
man
dr
moulton
now
professor
of
literary
theory
and
interpretation
in
the
university
of
chicago
of
both
these
writers
i
shall
have
something
to
say
but
first
and
generally
if
you
ask
me
why
all
their
pleas
have
not
yet
prevailed
i
will
give
you
my
own
answer
the
fault
as
usual
lies
in
ourselves
in
our
own
tameness
and
incuriosity
there
is
no
real
trouble
with
the
set
up
by
professionals
and
puritans
if
we
have
the
courage
to
walk
past
it
as
christian
walked
between
the
lions
no
real
tyranny
we
could
not
overthrow
if
it
were
worth
while
with
a
push
no
need
at
all
for
us
to
our
sword
in
myrtle
boughs
what
tyranny
exists
has
grown
up
through
the
quite
labours
of
quite
men
and
as
i
started
this
lecture
by
saying
i
have
never
heard
any
serious
reason
given
why
we
should
not
include
portions
of
the
english
bible
in
our
english
tripos
if
we
choose
nos
te
nos
facimus
scriptura
deam
then
why
do
we
choose
to
answer
this
we
must
i
suggest
seek
somewhat
further
back
the
bible
that
is
to
say
the
body
of
the
old
hebrew
literature
clothed
for
us
in
english
comes
to
us
in
our
childhood
but
how
does
it
come
let
me
amplifying
a
hint
from
dr
moulton
ask
you
to
imagine
a
volume
including
the
great
books
of
our
own
literature
all
bound
together
in
some
such
order
as
this
paradise
lost
descent
of
man
the
chronicle
walter
map
mill
on
liberty
hooker
ecclesiastical
polity
the
annual
register
froissart
adam
smith
wealth
of
nations
domesday
book
le
morte
campbell
lives
of
the
lord
chancellors
boswell

the

a

quarles

sermons
ruskin
blake
the
deserted
village
manfred
blair
grave
the
complaint
of
deor
bailey
festus
thompson
hound
of
heaven
will
you
next
imagine
that
in
this
volume
most
of
the
names
are
lost
that
of
the
few
that
survive
a
number
have
found
their
way
into
wrong
places
that
ruskin
for
example
is
credited
with
sartor
resartus
that
laus
veneris
and
dolores
are
ascribed
to
queen
elizabeth
the
anatomy
of
melancholy
to
charles
ii
and
that
as
for
the
titles
these
were
never
invented
by
the
authors
but
by
a
committee
will
you
still
go
on
to
imagine
that
all
the
poetry
is
printed
as
prose
while
all
the
long
paragraphs
of
prose
are
broken
up
into
short
verses
so
that
they
resemble
the
little
passages
set
out
for
parsing
or
analysis
in
an
examination
paper
this
device
as
you
know
was
first
invented
by
the
exiled
translators
who
published
the
geneva
bible
as
it
is
called
in
and
for
pulpit
use
for
handiness
of
reference
for
a
portion
it
has
its
obvious
advantages
but
it
is
after
all
and
at
the
best
a
very
primitive
device
and
for
my
part
i
consider
it
the
deadliest
invention
of
all
for
robbing
the
book
of
outward
resemblance
to
literature
and
converting
it
to
the
aspect
of
a
gazetteer
a
as
charles
lamb
puts
it
have
we
done
by
no
means
having
effected
all
this
let
us
pepper
the
result
over
with
italics
and
numerals
print
it
in
double
columns
with
a
marginal
gutter
on
either
side
each
gutter
pouring
down
an
inky
flow
of
references
and
cross
references
then
and
not
till
then
is
the
outward
disguise
complete
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
it
remains
only
then
to
appoint
it
to
be
read
in
churches
and
oblige
the
child
to
get
selected
portions
of
it
by
heart
on
sundays
but
you
are
yet
to
imagine
that
the
authors
themselves
have
taken
a
hand
in
the
game
that
the
later
ones
suppose
all
the
earlier
ones
to
have
been
predicting
all
the
time
in
a
nebulous
fashion
what
they
themselves
have
to
tell
and
indeed
to
have
written
mainly
with
that
object
so
that
macaulay
and
adam
smith
for
example
constantly
interrupt
the
thread
of
their
discourse
to
affirm
that
what
they
tell
us
must
be
right
because
walter
map
or
the
author
of
piers
plowman
foretold
it
ages
before
now
a
grown
man
that
is
to
say
a
comparatively
unimpressionable
man
that
is
again
to
say
a
man
past
the
age
when
to
enjoy
the
bible
is
priceless
has
probably
found
out
somehow
that
the
word
prophet
does
not
in
spite
of
vulgar
usage
mean
man
who
predicts
he
has
experienced
too
many
prophets
of
that
kind
especially
since
and
he
respects
isaiah
too
much
to
rank
isaiah
among
them
he
has
been
in
love
belike
he
has
read
the
song
of
solomon
he
very
much
doubts
if
on
the
evidence
solomon
was
the
kind
of
lover
to
have
written
that
song
and
he
is
quite
certain
that
when
the
lover
sings
to
his
beloved
thy
two
breasts
are
like
two
young
roes
that
are
twins
thy
neck
is
as
a
tower
of
ivory
thine
eyes
like
the
fishpools
in
heshbon
by
the
gate
of
he
knows
i
say
that
this
is
not
a
description
of
the
church
and
her
graces
as
the
audaciously
asserts
but
he
is
lazy
too
lazy
even
to
commend
the
revised
version
for
striking
solomon
out
of
the
bible
calling
the
poem
the
song
of
songs
omitting
the
absurd
and
printing
the
poetry
as
poetry
ought
to
be
printed
the
arrangement
was
good
enough
for
him
or
he
goes
to
church
on
christmas
day
and
listens
to
a
first
lesson
of
which
the
old
translators
made
nonsense
and
in
two
passages
at
least
stark
nonsense
but
again
the
old
nonsense
is
good
enough
for
him
soothing
in
fact
he
is
not
even
quite
sure
that
the
bible
looking
like
any
other
book
ought
to
be
put
in
the
hands
of
the
young
in
all
this
i
think
he
is
wrong
i
am
sure
he
is
wrong
if
our
contention
be
right
that
the
english
bible
should
be
studied
by
us
all
for
its
poetry
and
its
wonderful
language
as
well
as
for
its
religion
the
religion
and
the
poetry
being
in
fact
inseparable
for
then
in
euripides
phrase
we
should
clothe
the
bible
in
a
dress
through
which
its
beauty
might
best
shine
vii
if
you
ask
me
how
i
answer
first
begging
you
to
bear
in
mind
that
we
are
planning
the
form
of
the
book
for
our
purpose
and
that
other
forms
will
be
used
for
other
purposes
that
we
should
start
with
the
simplest
alterations
such
as
these
the
books
should
be
in
their
right
order
so
far
as
this
can
be
ascertained
and
much
of
it
has
been
ascertained
i
am
told
and
i
can
well
believe
that
this
would
at
a
stroke
clear
away
a
mass
of
confusion
in
strictly
biblical
criticism
but
that
is
not
my
business
i
know
that
it
would
immensely
help
our
study
i
should
print
the
prose
continuously
as
prose
is
ordinarily
and
properly
printed
and
the
poetry
in
verse
lines
as
poetry
is
ordinarily
and
properly
printed
and
i
should
print
each
on
a
page
of
one
column
with
none
but
the
necessary
notes
and
references
and
these
so
arranged
that
they
did
not
tease
and
distract
the
eye
this
arrangement
should
be
kept
whether
for
the
tripos
we
prescribe
a
book
in
the
authorised
text
or
in
the
revised
as
a
rule
perhaps
or
as
a
rule
for
some
years
to
come
we
shall
probably
rely
on
the
authorised
version
but
for
some
books
and
i
instance
job
we
should
undoubtedly
prefer
the
revised
with
the
verse
we
should
i
hold
go
farther
even
than
the
revisers
as
you
know
much
of
the
poetry
in
the
bible
especially
of
such
as
was
meant
for
music
is
composed
in
stanzaic
form
or
in
strophe
and
with
prelude
and
conclusion
sometimes
with
a
choral
refrain
we
should
print
these
i
contend
in
their
proper
form
just
as
we
should
print
an
english
poem
in
its
proper
form
i
shall
conclude
with
a
striking
instance
of
this
with
four
strophes
from
the
psalm
taking
leave
to
use
at
will
the
authorised
the
revised
and
the
coverdale
versions
each
strophe
you
will
note
has
a
double
refrain
as
dr
moulton
points
out
the
one
puts
up
a
cry
for
help
the
other
an
ejaculation
of
praise
after
the
help
has
come
each
refrain
has
a
sequel
verse
which
appropriately
changes
the
motive
and
sets
that
of
the
next
stanza
i
they
wandered
in
the
wilderness
in
a
solitary
way
they
found
no
city
to
dwell
in
hungry
and
thirsty
their
soul
fainted
in
them
they
cried
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
he
delivered
them
out
of
their
he
led
them
forth
by
a
straight
way
that
they
might
go
to
a
city
of
habitation
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
for
he
satisfieth
the
longing
soul
and
filleth
the
hungry
soul
with
goodness
ii
such
as
sit
in
darkness
and
in
the
shadow
of
death
being
bound
in
affliction
and
iron
because
they
rebelled
against
the
words
of
god
and
contemned
the
counsel
of
the
most
high
therefore
he
brought
down
their
heart
with
labour
they
fell
down
and
there
was
none
to
help
they
cried
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
he
saved
them
out
of
their
he
brought
them
out
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
and
brake
their
bands
in
sunder
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
for
he
hath
broken
the
gates
of
brass
and
cut
the
bars
of
iron
in
sunder
iii
fools
because
of
their
transgression
and
because
of
their
iniquities
are
afflicted
their
soul
abhorreth
all
manner
of
meat
and
they
draw
near
unto
death
door
they
cry
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
he
saveth
them
out
of
their
he
sendeth
his
word
and
healeth
them
and
delivereth
them
from
their
destructions
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
and
let
them
offer
the
sacrifices
of
thanksgiving
and
declare
his
works
with
singing
iv
they
that
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
that
do
business
in
great
waters
these
see
the
works
of
the
lord
and
his
wonders
in
the
deep
for
he
commandeth
and
raiseth
the
stormy
wind
which
lifteth
up
the
waves
thereof
they
mount
up
to
the
heaven
they
go
down
again
to
the
depths
their
soul
melteth
away
because
of
trouble
they
reel
to
and
fro
and
stagger
like
a
drunken
man
and
are
at
their
wits
end
they
cry
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
he
bringeth
them
out
of
their

maketh
the
storm
a
calm
so
that
the
waves
thereof
are
still
then
are
they
glad
because
they
be
quiet
so
he
bringeth
them
unto
the
haven

they
would
be
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
for
his
wonderful
works
to

let

exalt
him
also
in

assembly
of

of

lecture

on
reading
the
bible
iii
monday
may
i
my
task
gentlemen
is
mainly
practical
to
choose
a
particular
book
of
scripture
and
show
if
i
can
not
only
that
it
deserves
to
be
enjoyed
in
its
english
rendering
as
a
literary
masterpiece
because
it
abides
in
that
dress
an
indisputable
classic
for
us
as
surely
as
if
it
had
first
been
composed
in
english
but
that
it
can
for
purposes
of
study
serve
the
purpose
of
any
true
literary
school
of
english
as
readily
and
as
usefully
as
the
prologue
to
the
canterbury
tales
or
hamlet
or
paradise
lost
i
shall
choose
the
book
of
job
for
several
reasons
presently
to
be
given
but
beg
you
to
understand
that
while
taking
it
for
a
striking
illustration
i
use
it
but
to
illustrate
that
what
may
be
done
with
job
may
in
degree
be
done
with
ruth
with
esther
with
the
psalms
the
song
of
songs
ecclesiastes
with
isaiah
of
jerusalem
ezekiel
sundry
of
the
prophets
even
with
st
luke
gospel
or
st
paul
letters
to
the
churches
my
first
reason
then
for
choosing
job
has
already
been
given
it
is
the
most
striking
illustration
to
be
found
many
of
the
psalms
touch
perfection
as
lyrical
strains
of
the
ecstacy
of
passion
in
love
i
suppose
the
song
of
songs
to
express
the
very
last
word
there
are
chapters
of
isaiah
that
snatch
the
very
soul
and
ravish
it
aloft
in
no
literature
known
to
me
are
short
stories
told
with
such
sweet
austerity
of
art
as
in
the
gospel
parables
i
can
even
imagine
a
high
and
learned
artist
in
words
after
rejecting
them
as
divine
on
many
grounds
surrendering
in
the
end
to
their
divine
artistry
but
for
high
seriousness
combined
with
architectonic
treatment
on
a
great
scale
for
sublimity
of
conception
working
malleably
within
a
structure
which
is
simple
severe
complete
having
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
end
for
diction
never
less
than
adequate
constantly
right
and
therefore
not
seldom
superb
as
theme
thought
and
utterance
soar
up
together
and
make
one
miracle
i
can
name
no
single
book
of
the
bible
to
compare
with
job
my
second
reason
is
that
the
poem
being
brief
compendious
and
quite
simple
in
structure
can
be
handily
expounded
job
is
what
milton
precisely
called
it
brief
model
and
my
third
reason
which
i
must
not
hide
is
that
two
writers
whom
i
mentioned
in
my
last
lecture
lord
latymer
and
professor
moulton
have
already
done
this
for
me
a
man
who
drives
at
practice
must
use
the
tools
other
men
have
made
so
he
use
them
with
due
acknowledgment
and
this
acknowledgment
i
pay
by
referring
you
to
book
ii
of
lord
latymer
the
poet
charter
and
to
the
analysis
of
job
with
which
professor
moulton
introduces
his
literary
study
of
the
bible
ii
but
i
have
a
fourth
reason
out
of
which
i
might
make
an
apparent
fifth
by
presenting
it
to
you
in
two
different
ways
those
elders
of
you
who
have
followed
certain
earlier
lectures
the
art
of
writing
may
remember
that
they
set
very
little
store
upon
metre
as
a
dividing
line
between
poetry
and
prose
and
no
store
at
all
upon
rhyme
i
am
tempted
to
go
farther
and
to
maintain
that
the
larger
the
sublimer
your
subject
is
the
more
impertinent
rhyme
becomes
to
it
and
that
this
impertinence
increases
in
a
sort
of
geometrical
progression
as
you
advance
from
monosyllabic
to
dissyllabic
and
on
to
trisyllabic
rhyme
let
me
put
this
by
a
series
of
examples
we
start
with
no
rhyme
at
all
hail
holy
light
offspring
of
heaven
first
born
or
of
the
eternal
coeternal
beam
may
i
express
thee
unblamed
since
god
is
light
and
never
but
in
unapproached
light
dwelt
from
eternity
we
feel
of
this
as
we
feel
of
a
great
passage
in
hamlet
or
lear
that
here
is
verse
at
once
capable
of
the
highest
sublimity
and
capable
of
sustaining
its
theme
of
lifting
and
lowering
it
at
will
with
endless
resource
in
the
slide
and
pause
of
the
caesura
to
carry
it
on
and
on
we
feel
it
to
be
adequate
too
for
quite
plain
straightforward
narrative
as
in
this
passage
from
balder
dead
but
from
the
hill
of
lidskialf
odin
rose
the
throne
from
which
his
eye
surveys
the
world
and
mounted
sleipner
and
in
darkness
rode
to
asgard
and
the
stars
came
out
in
heaven
high
over
asgard
to
light
home
the
king
but
fiercely
odin
gallop
moved
in
heart
and
swift
to
asgard
to
the
gate
he
came
and
terribly
the
hoofs
of
sleipner
rang
along
the
flinty
floor
of
asgard
streets
and
the
gods
trembled
on
their
golden
beds
hearing
the
wrathful
father
coming
home
for
dread
for
like
a
whirlwind
odin
came
and
to
valhalla
gate
he
rode
and
left
sleipner
and
sleipner
went
to
his
own
stall
and
in
valhalla
odin
laid
him
down
now
of
rhyme
he
were
a
fool
who
with
lycidas
or
gray
elegy
or
certain
choruses
of
prometheus
unbound
or
page
after
page
of
victor
hugo
in
his
mind
should
assert
it
to
be
in
itself
inimical
or
a
hindrance
or
even
less
than
a
help
to
sublimity
or
who
with
dante
in
his
mind
should
assert
it
to
be
in
itself
any
bar
to
continuous
and
sustained
sublimity
but
languages
differ
vastly
in
their
wealth
of
rhyme
and
differ
out
of
any
proportion
to
their
wealth
in
words
english
for
instance
being
infinitely
richer
than
italian
in
vocabulary
yet
almost
ridiculously
poorer
in
dissyllabic
or
feminine
rhymes
speaking
generally
i
should
say
that
in
proportion
to
its
wonderful
vocabulary
english
is
poor
even
in
single
rhymes
that
the
words
for
example
have
lists
of
possible
congeners
so
limited
that
the
mind
hearing
the
word
runs
forward
to
match
it
with
or
or
even
with
and
this
gives
it
a
sense
of
arrest
of
listening
of
check
of
waiting
which
alike
impedes
the
flow
of
pope
in
imitating
homer
and
of
spenser
in
essaying
a
sublime
and
continuous
story
of
his
own
it
does
well
enough
to
carry
chaucer
over
any
gap
with
a
as
i
you
say
or
as
i
you
tell
but
it
does
so
at
a
total
cost
of
the
sublime
and
this
i
think
was
really
at
the
back
of
milton
mind
when
in
the
preface
to
paradise
lost
he
championed
blank
verse
against
jingling
sound
of
like
endings
but
when
we
pass
from
single
rhymes
to
double
of
which
dante
had
an
inexhaustible
store
we
find
the
english
poet
almost
a
pauper
so
nearly
a
pauper
that
he
has
to
achieve
each
new
rhyme
by
a
trick
which
tricking
is
fatal
to
rapture
alike
in
the
poet
and
the
hearer
let
me
instance
a
poem
which
planned
for
sublimity
keeps
tumbling
flat
upon
earth
through
the
inherent
fault
of
the
machine
i
mean
myers
st
paul
a
poem
which
finely
conceived
pondered
worked
and
upon
in
edition
after
edition
was
from
the
first
condemned
to
my
mind
by
the
technical
bar
of
dissyllabic
rhyme
which
the
poet
unhappily
chose
i
take
one
of
its
most
deeply
felt
passages
that
of
st
paul
protesting
against
his
conversion
being
taken
for
instantaneous
wholly
accounted
for
by
the
miraculous
vision
related
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
let
no
man
think
that
sudden
in
a
minute
all
is
accomplished
and
the
work
is
done
though
with
thine
earliest
dawn
thou
shouldst
begin
it
scarce
were
it
ended
in
thy
setting
sun
oh
the
regret
the
struggle
and
the
failing
oh
the
days
desolate
and
useless
years
vows
in
the
night
so
fierce
and
unavailing
stings
of
my
shame
and
passion
of
my
tears
how
have
i
seen
in
araby
orion
seen
without
seeing
till
he
set
again
known
the
and
thunder
of
the
lion
silence
and
sounds
of
the
prodigious
plain
how
have
i
knelt
with
arms
of
my
aspiring
lifted
all
night
in
irresponsive
air
dazed
and
amazed
with
overmuch
desiring
blank
with
the
utter
agony
of
prayer
ye
will
say
thou
who
at
damascus
sawest
the
splendour
answeredst
the
voice
so
hast
thou
suffered
and
canst
dare
to
ask
us
paul
of
the
romans
bidding
us
rejoice
you
can
not
say
i
have
instanced
a
passage
anything
short
of
fine
but
do
you
not
feel
that
a
man
who
is
searching
for
a
rhyme
to
damascus
has
not
really
the
time
to
cry
father
is
not
your
own
rapture
interrupted
by
some
wonder
will
he
bring
it
off
and
when
he
has
searched
and
contrived
to
us
are
we
responsive
to
the
ecstacy
has
he
not
if
i
may
employ
an
oriental
trope
for
once
let
in
the
chill
breath
of
cleverness
upon
the
garden
of
beatitude
no
man
can
be
clever
and
ecstatic
at
the
same
moment
as
for
triple
rhymes
rhymes
of
the
comedian
who
had
a
lot
news
with
many
curious
facts
about
the
square
on
the
hypotenuse
or
the
cassiowary
who
ate
the
missionary
on
the
plains
of
timbuctoo
with
bible
too
they
are
for
the
facetious
and
removed
as
far
as
geometrical
progression
can
remove
them
from
any
paradise
lost
or
regained
it
may
sound
a
genuine
note
now
and
then
alas
for
the
rarity
of
christian
charity
under
the
sun
oh
it
was
pitiful
near
a
whole
city
full
home
she
had
none
but
not
often
and
i
think
never
but
in
lyric
iii
so
much
then
for
rhyme
we
will
approach
the
question
of
metre
helped
or
unhelped
by
rhyme
in
another
way
and
a
way
yet
more
practical
when
milton
determined
to
write
a
grand
epic
was
casting
about
for
his
subject
he
had
a
mind
for
some
while
to
attempt
the
story
of
job
you
may
find
evidence
for
this
in
a
ms
preserved
here
in
trinity
college
library
you
will
find
printed
evidence
in
a
passage
of
his
reason
of
church
government
serves
not
now
he
writes
perhaps
i
might
seem
too
profuse
to
give
any
certain
account
of
what
the
mind
at
home
in
the
spacious
circuits
of
her
musing
hath
liberty
to
propose
to
herself
though
of
highest
hope
and
hardest
attempting
whether
that
epic
form
whereof
the
two
poems
of
homer
and
those
other
two
of
virgil
and
tasso
are
a
diffuse
and
the
book
of
job
a
brief
model
again
we
know
job
to
have
been
one
of
the
three
stories
meditated
by
shelley
as
themes
for
great
lyrical
dramas
the
other
two
being
the
madness
of
tasso
and
prometheus
unbound
shelley
never
abandoned
this
idea
of
a
lyrical
drama
on
job
and
if
milton
abandoned
the
idea
of
an
epic
there
are
passages
in
paradise
lost
as
there
are
passages
in
prometheus
unbound
that
might
well
have
been
written
for
this
other
story
take
the
lines
why
am
i
mock
with
death
and
lengthen
out
to
deathless
pain
how
gladly
would
i
meet
mortality
my
sentence
and
be
earth
insensible
how
glad
would
lay
me
down
as
in
my
mother
lap
there
i
should
rest
and
sleep
secure
what
is
this
as
lord
latymer
asks
but
an
echo
of
job
words
for
now
should
i
have
lien
down
and
been
quiet
i
should
have
slept
then
had
i
been
at
rest
with
kings
and
counsellers
of
the
earth
which
built
desolate
places
for
themselves
there
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
there
the
weary
be
at
rest
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
point
out
how
exactly
though
from
two
nearly
opposite
angles
the
story
of
job
would
hit
the
philosophy
of
milton
and
the
philosophy
of
shelley
to
the
very
heart
what
is
the
story
of
the
afflicted
patriarch
but
a
direct
challenge
to
a
protestant
like
milton
i
use
the
word
in
its
strict
sense
to
justify
the
ways
of
god
to
man
it
is
the
very
purpose
in
sum
of
the
book
of
job
as
it
is
the
very
purpose
in
sum
of
paradise
lost
and
since
both
poems
can
only
work
out
the
justification
by
long
argumentative
speeches
both
poems
lamentably
fail
as
real
solutions
of
the
difficulty
to
this
i
shall
recur
and
here
merely
observe
that
s
excuse
a
god
who
can
only
explain
himself
by
the
help
of
scolding
or
of
advocacy
though
he
employ
an
archangel
for
advocate
has
given
away
the
half
of
his
case
by
the
implicit
admission
that
there
are
two
sides
to
the
question
and
when
we
have
put
aside
the
poetical
ineptitude
of
a
creator
driven
to
apology
it
remains
that
to
shelley
the
jehovah
who
for
a
sort
of
wager
allowed
satan
to
torture
job
merely
for
the
game
of
testing
him
would
be
no
better
than
any
other
tyrant
would
be
a
miscreant
creator
abominable
as
the
zeus
of
the
prometheus
unbound
now
you
may
urge
that
milton
and
shelley
dropped
job
for
hero
because
both
felt
him
to
be
a
merely
static
figure
and
that
the
one
chose
satan
the
rebel
angel
the
other
chose
prometheus
the
rebel
titan
because
both
are
active
rebels
and
as
epic
and
drama
require
action
each
of
these
heroes
makes
the
thing
move
that
satan
and
prometheus
are
not
passive
sufferers
like
job
but
souls
as
quick
and
fiery
as
byron
lucifer
souls
who
dare
use
their
immortality
souls
who
dare
look
the
omnipotent
tyrant
in
his
everlasting
face
and
tell
him
that
his
evil
is
not
good
very
well
urge
this
urge
it
with
all
your
might
all
the
while
you
will
be
doing
just
what
i
desire
you
to
do
using
job
alongside
prometheus
unbound
and
paradise
lost
as
a
comparative
work
of
literature
but
if
you
ask
me
for
my
own
opinion
why
milton
and
shelley
dropped
their
intention
to
make
poems
on
the
book
of
job
it
is
that
they
no
sooner
tackled
it
than
they
found
it
to
be
a
magnificent
poem
already
and
a
poem
on
which
with
all
their
genius
they
found
themselves
unable
to
improve
i
want
you
to
realise
a
thing
most
simple
demonstrable
by
five
minutes
of
practice
yet
so
confused
by
conventional
notions
of
what
poetry
is
that
i
dare
say
it
to
be
equally
demonstrable
that
milton
and
shelley
discovered
it
only
by
experiment
does
this
appear
to
you
a
bold
thing
to
say
of
so
tremendous
an
artist
as
milton
well
of
course
it
would
be
cruel
to
quote
in
proof
his
paraphrases
of
psalms
cxiv
and
cxxxvi
to
set
against
the
authorised
when
israel
went
out
of
egypt
the
house
of
jacob
from
a
people
of
strange
language
such
pomposity
as
when
the
blest
seed
of
terah
faithful
son
after
long
toil
their
liberty
had
won
or
against
o
give
thanks
to
him
that
stretched
out
the
earth
above
the
waters
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
to
him
that
made
great
lights
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
such
stuff
as
who
did
the
solid
earth
ordain
to
rise
above
the
watery
plain
his
mercies
aye
endure
faithful
ever
who
by
his
might
did
fill
the
world
with
light
his
mercies
aye
endure
faithful
ever
verses
yet
further
weakened
by
the
late
sir
william
baker
for
hymns
ancient
and
modern
it
were
cruel
i
say
to
condemn
these
attempts
as
little
above
those
of
sternhold
and
hopkins
or
even
of
those
of
tate
and
brady
for
milton
made
them
at
fifteen
years
old
and
he
who
afterwards
consecrated
his
youth
to
poetry
soon
learned
to
know
better
and
yet
bearing
in
mind
the
passages
in
paradise
lost
and
paradise
regained
which
paraphrase
the
scriptural
narrative
i
can
not
forbear
the
suspicion
that
though
as
an
artist
he
had
the
instinct
to
feel
it
he
never
quite
won
to
the
simple
fact
that
the
thing
had
already
been
done
and
surpassingly
well
done
he
who
did
so
much
to
liberate
poetry
from
rhyme
he
even
he
who
in
the
grand
choruses
of
samson
agonistes
did
so
much
to
liberate
it
from
strict
metre
never
quite
realised
being
by
the
fetish
that
rides
between
two
panniers
the
sacred
and
the
profane
that
this
translation
of
job
already
belongs
to
the
category
of
poetry
poetry
already
above
metre
and
in
rhythm
far
on
its
way
to
the
insurpassable
if
rhyme
be
allowed
to
that
greatest
of
arts
if
metre
is
not
rhythm
above
both
for
her
service
hear
in
a
sentence
how
this
poem
uplifts
the
rhythm
of
the
vulgate
deus
magnus
vincens
scientiam
nostram
numerus
inestimabilis
but
hear
in
a
longer
passage
how
our
english
rhythm
swings
and
sways
to
the
hebrew
parallels
surely
there
is
a
mine
for
silver
and
a
place
for
gold
which
they
refine
iron
is
taken
out
of
the
earth
and
brass
is
molten
out
of
the
stone
setteth
an
end
to
darkness
and
searcheth
out
to
the
furthest
bound
the
stones
of
thick
darkness
and
of
the
shadow
of
death
he
breaketh
open
a
shaft
away
from
where
men
sojourn
they
are
forgotten
of
the
foot
passeth
they
hang
afar
from
men
they
swing
to
and
fro
as
for
the
earth
out
of
it
cometh
bread
and
underneath
it
is
turned
up
as
it
were
by
fire
the
atones
thereof
are
the
place
of
sapphires
and
it
hath
dust
of
gold
that
path
no
bird
of
prey
knoweth
neither
hath
the
falcon
eye
seen
it
the
proud
beasts
have
not
trodden
it
nor
hath
the
fierce
lion
passed
thereby
he
putteth
forth
his
hand
upon
the
flinty
rock
he
overturneth
the
mountains
by
the
roots
he
cutteth
out
channels
among
the
rocks
and
his
eye
seeth
every
precious
thing
he
bindeth
the
streams
that
they
trickle
not
and
the
thing
that
is
hid
bringeth
he
forth
to
light
but
where
shall
wisdom
be

where
is
the
place
of
understanding
man
knoweth
not
the
price
thereof
neither
is
it
found
in
the
land
of
the
living
the
deep
saith
it
is
not
in

and
the
sea
saith
it
is
not
with
me
it
can
not
be
gotten
for

neither
shall
silver

for
the

thereof
it
can
not
be

with

the
sapphire
gold
and

can

it
neither

the

no

the

rubies
the
topaz

it
neither
shall
it
be

whence
then
cometh
wisdom
and
where
is
the
place
of
understanding
seeing
it
is
hid
from
the
eyes
of
all
living
and
kept
close
from
the
fowls
of
the
air
destruction
and
death
say
we
have
heard
a
rumour
thereof
with
our
ears
god
understandeth
the
way
thereof
and
he
knoweth
the
place
thereof
for
he
looketh
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
seeth
under
the
whole
heaven
to
make
a
weight
for
the
wind
yea
he
meteth
out
the
waters
by
measure
when
he
made
a
decree
for
the
rain
and
a
way
for
the
lightning
of
the
thunder
then
did
he
see
it
and
declare
it
he
established
it
yea
and
searched
it
out
and
unto
man
he
said
behold
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
wisdom
and
to
depart
from
evil
is
understanding
is
that
poetry
surely
it
is
poetry
can
you
improve
it
with
the
embellishments
of
rhyme
and
strict
scansion
well
sundry
bold
men
have
tried
and
i
will
choose
for
your
judgment
the
rendering
of
a
part
of
the
above
passage
by
one
who
is
by
no
means
the
worst
of
them
a
hardy
anonymous
scotsman
his
version
was
published
at
falkirk
in
his
hand
on
the
rock
the
adventurer
puts
and
mountains
entire
overturns
by
the
roots
new
rivers
in
rocks
are
enchased
by
his
might
and
everything
precious
revealed
to
his
sight
the
floods
from
he
bindeth
at
will
and
the
thing
that
is
hid
bringeth
forth
by
his
skill
but
where
real
wisdom
is
found
can
he
shew
or
the
place
understanding
inhabiteth
no
men
know
not
the
value
the
price
of
this
gem
is
not
found
in
the
land
of
the
living
with
them
it
is
not
in
me
saith
the
depth
and
the
sea
with
the
voice
of
an
echo
repeats
not
in
me
i
have
a
suspicion
somehow
that
what
the
sea
really
answered
in
its
northern
vernacular
was
either
whence
then
cometh
wisdom
and
where
is
the
place
understanding
hath
chosen
since
this
is
the
case
enough
this
not
only
shows
how
that
other
rendering
can
be
spoilt
even
to
the
point
of
burlesque
by
an
attempt
on
preconceived
notions
to
embellish
it
with
metre
and
rhyme
but
it
also
hints
that
parallel
verse
will
actually
resent
and
abhor
such
embellishment
even
by
the
most
skilled
hand
yet
i
repeat
our
version
of
job
is
poetry
undeniable
what
follows
why
it
follows
that
in
the
course
of
studying
it
as
literature
we
have
found
experimentally
settled
for
us
and
on
the
side
of
freedom
a
dispute
in
which
scores
of
eminent
critics
have
taken
sides
a
dispute
revived
but
yesterday
if
we
omit
the
blank
and
devastated
days
of
this
war
by
the
writers
and
apostles
of
there
be
poetry
without
metre
free
verse
a
true
poetic
form
why
our
book
of
job
being
poetry
unmistakable
poetry
of
course
there
can
to
be
sure
it
is
these
apostles
are
butting
at
an
open
door
nothing
remains
for
them
but
to
go
and
write
as
fine
as
those
of
job
in
our
english
translation
or
suppose
even
that
they
write
as
well
as
paul
fort
they
will
yet
be
writing
ancestrally
not
as
innovators
but
as
renewers
nothing
is
done
in
literature
by
arguing
whether
or
not
this
or
that
be
possible
or
permissible
the
only
way
to
prove
it
possible
or
permissible
is
to
go
and
do
it
and
then
you
are
lucky
indeed
if
some
ancient
writers
have
not
forestalled
you
iv
now
for
another
question
much
argued
you
will
remember
a
few
years
ago
there
can
there
be
such
a
thing
as
a
static
theatre
a
static
drama
most
of
you
i
daresay
remember
maeterlinck
definition
of
this
and
his
demand
for
it
to
summarise
him
roughly
he
contends
that
the
old
drama
the
traditional
the
conventional
drama
lives
by
action
that
in
aristotle
phrase
it
represents
men
doing
greek
prattontas
and
resolves
itself
into
a
struggle
of
human
wills
whether
against
the
gods
as
in
ancient
tragedy
or
against
one
another
as
in
modern
maeterlinck
tells
us
there
is
a
tragic
element
in
the
life
of
every
day
that
is
far
more
real
far
more
penetrating
far
more
akin
to
the
true
self
that
is
in
us
than
is
the
tragedy
that
lies
in
great
adventure
it
goes
beyond
the
determined
struggle
of
man
against
man
and
desire
against
desire
it
goes
beyond
the
eternal
conflict
of
duty
and
passion
its
province
is
rather
to
reveal
to
us
how
truly
wonderful
is
the
mere
act
of
living
and
to
throw
light
upon
the
existence
of
the
soul
in
the
midst
of
immensities
to
hush
the
discourse
of
reason
and
sentiment
so
that
above
the
tumult
may
be
heard
the
solemn
uninterrupted
whisperings
of
man
and
his
destiny
to
the
tragic
author
he
goes
on
later
as
to
the
mediocre
painter
who
still
lingers
over
historical
pictures
it
is
only
the
violence
of
the
anecdote
that
appeals
and
in
his
representation
thereof
does
the
entire
interest
of
his
work
consist
indeed
when
i
go
to
a
theatre
i
feel
as
though
i
were
spending
a
few
hours
with
my
ancestors
who
conceived
life
as
though
it
were
something
that
was
primitive
arid
and
brutal
i
am
shown
a
deceived
husband
killing
his
wife
a
woman
poisoning
her
lover
a
son
avenging
his
father
a
father
slaughtering
his
children
murdered
kings
ravished
virgins
imprisoned
citizens
in
a
word
all
the
sublimity
of
tradition
but
alas
how
superficial
and
material
blood
and
death
what
can
i
learn
from
creatures
who
have
but
one
fixed
idea
who
have
no
time
to
live
for
that
there
is
a
rival
a
mistress
whom
it
behoves
them
to
put
to
death
maeterlinck
does
not
he
says
know
if
the
static
drama
of
his
craving
be
impossible
he
inclines
to
think
instancing
some
greek
tragedies
such
as
prometheus
and
choephori
that
it
already
exists
but
may
we
not
out
of
the
east
the
slow
the
stationary
east
fetch
an
instance
more
convincing
v
the
drama
of
job
opens
with
a
prologue
in
the
mouth
of
a
narrator
there
was
a
man
in
the
land
of
uz
named
job
upright
of
great
substance
in
sheep
cattle
and
oxen
blest
also
with
seven
sons
and
three
daughters
after
telling
of
their
family
life
how
wholesome
it
is
and
pious
and
happy
the
prologue
passes
to
a
council
held
in
heaven
the
lord
sits
there
and
the
sons
of
god
present
themselves
each
from
his
province
enters
satan
whom
we
had
better
call
the
adversary
from
his
sphere
of
inspection
the
earth
and
reports
the
lord
specially
questions
him
concerning
job
pattern
of
men
the
adversary
demurs
job
fear
god
for
nought
hast
thou
not
set
a
hedge
about
his
prosperity
but
put
forth
thy
hand
and
touch
all
that
he
hath
and
he
will
renounce
thee
to
thy
face
the
lord
gives
leave
for
this
trial
to
be
made
you
will
recall
the
opening
of
everyman
so
in
the
midst
of
his
wealth
a
messenger
came
to
job
and
says
the
oxen
were
plowing
and
the
asses
feeding
beside
them
and
the
sabeans
fell
upon
them
and
took
them
away
yea
they
have
slain
the
servants
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
while
he
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
the
fire
of
god
is
fallen
from
heaven
and
hath
burned
up
the
sheep
and
the
servants
and
consumed
them
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
while
he
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
the
chaldeans
made
three
bands
and
fell
upon
the
camels
and
have
taken
them
away
yea
and
slain
the
servants
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
while
he
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
in
their
eldest
brother
house
and
behold
there
came
a
great
wind
from
the
wilderness
and
smote
the
four
corners
of
the
house
and
it
fell
upon
the
young
men
and
they
are
dead
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
then
job
arose
and
rent
his
mantle
and
shaved
his
head
and
fell
down
upon
the
ground
and
worshipped
and
he
said
naked
came
i
out
of
my
mother
womb
and
naked
shall
i
return
thither
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
so
the
adversary
is
foiled
and
job
has
not
renounced
god
a
second
council
is
held
in
heaven
and
the
adversary
being
questioned
has
to
admit
job
integrity
but
proposes
a
severer
test
skin
for
skin
yea
all
that
a
man
hath
will
he
give
for
his
life
but
put
forth
thine
hand
now
and
touch
his
bone
and
his
flesh
and
he
will
renounce
thee
to
thy
face
again
leave
is
given
and
the
adversary
smites
job
with
the
most
hideous
and
loathsome
form
of
leprosy
his
kinsfolk
as
we
learn
later
have
already
begun
to
desert
and
hold
aloof
from
him
as
a
man
marked
out
by
god
displeasure
but
now
he
passes
out
from
their
midst
as
one
unclean
from
head
to
foot
and
seats
himself
on
the
that
is
upon
the
mezbele
or
heap
of
refuse
which
accumulates
outside
arab
villages
dung
says
professor
moulton
is
heaped
upon
the
mezbele
of
the
hauran
villages
is
not
mixed
with
straw
which
in
that
warm
and
dry
land
is
not
needed
for
litter
and
it
comes
mostly
from
animals
as
the
flocks
and
oxen
are
left
in
the
grazing
places
it
is
carried
in
baskets
in
a
dry
state
to
this
place
and
usually
burnt
once
a
month
the
ashes
remain
if
the
village
has
been
inhabited
for
centuries
the
mezbele
reaches
a
height
far
overtopping
it
the
winter
rains
reduce
it
into
a
compact
mass
and
it
becomes
by
and
by
a
solid
hill
of
earth
the
mezbele
serves
the
inhabitants
for
a
watchtower
and
in
the
sultry
evenings
for
a
place
of
concourse
because
there
is
a
current
of
air
on
the
height
there
all
day
long
the
children
play
about
it
and
there
the
outcast
who
has
been
stricken
with
some
loathsome
malady
and
is
not
allowed
to
enter
the
dwellings
of
men
lays
himself
down
begging
an
alms
of
the
by
day
and
by
night
sheltering
himself
among
the
ashes
which
the
heat
of
the
sun
has
warmed
here
then
sits
in
his
misery
forsaken
grandee
and
here
yet
another
temptation
comes
to
him
this
time
not
expressly
allowed
by
the
lord
much
foolish
condemnation
and
i
may
add
some
foolish
facetiousness
has
been
heaped
on
job
wife
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
is
a
wicked
woman
she
has
borne
her
part
in
the
pious
and
happy
family
life
now
taken
away
she
has
uttered
no
word
of
complaint
though
all
the
substance
be
swallowed
up
and
her
children
with
it
but
now
the
sight
of
her
innocent
husband
thus
helpless
thus
incurably
smitten
wrings
through
love
and
anguish
and
indignation
this
cry
from
her
dost
thou
still
hold
fast
thine
integrity
renounce
god
and
die
but
job
answered
soothing
her
thou
speakest
as
one
of
the
foolish
women
speaketh
what
shall
we
receive
good
at
the
hand
of
god
and
shall
we
not
receive
evil
so
the
second
trial
ends
and
job
has
sinned
not
with
his
lips
but
now
comes
the
third
trial
which
needs
no
council
in
heaven
to
decree
it
travellers
by
the
mound
saw
this
figure
seated
there
patient
uncomplaining
an
object
of
awe
even
to
the
children
who
at
first
mocked
him
asked
this
man
history
and
hearing
of
it
smote
on
their
breasts
and
made
a
token
of
it
and
carried
the
news
into
far
countries
until
it
reached
the
ears
of
job
three
friends
all
great
tribesmen
like
himself
eliphaz
the
temanite
bildad
the
shuhite
and
zophar
the
naamathite
these
three
made
an
appointment
together
to
travel
and
visit
job
when
they
lifted
up
their
eyes
afar
off
and
knew
him
not
they
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
then
they
went
up
and
sat
down
opposite
him
on
the
ground
but
the
majesty
of
suffering
is
silent
here
i
and
sorrows
sit
here
is
my
throne
bid
kings
come
bow
to
it
no
not
a
word
and
with
the
grave
courtesy
of
eastern
men
they
too
are
silent
so
they
sat
down
with
him
upon
the
ground
seven
days
and
seven
nights
and
none
spake
a
word
unto
him
for
they
saw
that
his
grief
was
very
great
the
prologue
ends
the
scene
is
set
after
seven
days
of
silence
the
real
drama
opens
vi
of
the
drama
itself
i
shall
attempt
no
analysis
referring
you
for
this
to
the
two
books
from
which
i
have
already
quoted
my
purpose
being
merely
to
persuade
you
that
this
surpassing
poem
can
be
studied
and
ought
to
be
studied
as
literature
i
shall
content
myself
with
turning
it
so
to
speak
once
or
twice
in
my
hand
and
glancing
one
or
two
facets
at
you
to
begin
with
then
you
will
not
have
failed
to
notice
in
the
setting
out
of
the
drama
a
curious
resemblance
between
job
and
the
prometheus
of
aeschylus
the
curtain
in
each
play
lifts
on
a
figure
solitary
tortured
for
no
reason
that
seems
good
to
us
by
a
higher
will
which
we
are
told
is
god
the
chorus
of
in
the
opening
of
the
greek
play
bears
no
small
resemblance
in
attitude
of
mind
to
job
three
friends
when
job
at
length
breaks
the
intolerable
silence
with
let
the
day
perish
wherein
i
was
born
and
the
night
which
said
there
is
a
man
child
conceived
he
uses
just
such
an
outburst
as
prometheus
and
as
he
is
answered
by
his
friends
so
the
nymphs
at
once
exclaim
to
prometheus
seest
thou
not
that
thou
hast
sinned
but
at
once
for
anyone
with
a
sense
of
comparative
literature
is
set
up
a
comparison
between
the
persistent
west
and
the
persistent
east
between
the
fiery
energising
rebel
and
the
patient
victim
of
these
two
both
good
one
will
dare
everything
to
release
mankind
from
thrall
the
other
will
submit
and
justify
himself
mankind
too
if
it
may
hap
by
submission
at
once
this
difference
is
seen
to
give
a
difference
of
form
to
the
drama
our
poem
is
purely
static
some
critics
can
detect
little
individuality
in
job
three
friends
to
distinguish
them
for
my
part
i
find
eliphaz
more
of
a
personage
than
the
other
two
grander
in
the
volume
of
his
mind
securer
in
wisdom
as
i
find
zophar
rather
noticeably
a
greybeard
and
bildad
a
man
of
the
kind
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
prefer
not
to
search
for
individuality
in
these
men
i
prefer
to
see
them
as
three
figures
with
eyes
of
stone
almost
expressionless
for
in
truth
they
are
the
conventions
all
through
the
orthodox
men
addressing
job
the
reality
and
their
words
come
to
this
thou
sufferest
therefore
must
have
sinned
all
suffering
is
must
be
a
judgment
upon
sin
else
god
is
not
righteous
they
are
statuesque
as
the
drama
is
static
the

yet
so

is
this

who
has
not

and
will
not
renounce

that
still
and
ever
he
clamours
for

of

still
getting
no

he
lifts
up
his

calls
the

with
a

he
covers

the
words

vii
they
are
ended
even
though
at
this
point
when
the
debate
seems
to
be
closed
a
young
aramaean
arab
elihu
who
has
been
loitering
around
and
listening
to
the
controversy
bursts
in
and
delivers
his
young
opinions
they
are
violent
and
at
the
same
time
quite
raw
and
priggish
job
troubles
not
to
answer
the
others
keep
a
chilling
silence
but
while
this
young
man
rants
pointing
skyward
now
and
again
we
see
we
feel
it
is
most
wonderfully
conveyed
as
clearly
as
if
indicated
by
successive
a
terrific
gathering
a
with
a
whirlwind
it
gathers
it
is
upon
them
it
darkens
them
with
dread
until
even
the
words
of
elihu
dry
on
his
lips
if
a
man
speak
surely
he
shall
be
swallowed
up
it
breaks
and
blasts
and
confounds
them
and
out
of
it
the
lord
speaks
now
of
that
famous
and
marvellous
speech
put
by
the
poet
into
the
mouth
of
god
we
may
say
what
may
be
said
of
all
speeches
put
by
man
into
the
mouth
of
god
we
may
say
as
of
the
speeches
of
the
archangel
in
paradise
lost
that
it
is
argument
and
argument
by
its
very
nature
admits
of
being
answered
but
if
to
make
god
talk
at
all
be
anthropomorphism
here
is
anthropomorphism
at
its
very
best
in
its
effort
to
reach
to
god
there
is
a
hush
the
storm
clears
away
and
in
this
hush
the
voice
of
the
narrator
is
heard
again
pronouncing
the
epilogue
job
has
looked
in
the
face
of
god
and
reproached
him
as
a
friend
reproaches
a
friend
therefore
his
captivity
was
turned
and
his
wealth
returned
to
him
and
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
and
saw
his
sons
sons
unto
the
fourth
generation
so
job
died
being
old
and
full
of
years
viii
structurally
a
great
poem
historically
a
great
poem
philosophically
a
great
poem
so
rendered
for
us
in
noble
english
diction
as
to
be
worthy
in
any
comparison
of
diction
structure
ancestry
thought
why
should
we
not
study
it
in
our
english
school
if
only
for
purpose
of
comparison
i
conclude
with
these
words
of
lord
latymer
there
is
nothing
comparable
with
it
except
the
prometheus
bound
of
aeschylus
it
is
eternal
illimitable
its
scope
is
the
relation
between
god
and
man
it
is
a
vast
liberation
a
great
of
the
spirit
of
man
nay
rather
a
great
acquittal
footnote
it
is
fair
to
say
that
myers
cancelled
the
damascus
stanza
in

of

wednesday
october
i
let
us
hark
back
gentlemen
to
our
original
problem
and
consider
if
our
dilatory
way
have
led
us
to
some
glimpse
of
a
practical
solution
we
may
it
thus
assuming
it
to
be
true
as
men
of
science
assure
us
that
the
weight
of
this
planet
remains
constant
and
is
what
it
was
when
mankind
carelessly
laid
it
on
the
shoulders
of
atlas
that
nothing
abides
but
it
goes
that
nothing
goes
but
in
some
form
or
other
it
comes
back
you
and
i
may
well
indulge
a
wonder
what
reflections
upon
this
astonishing
fact
our
university
librarian
mr
jenkinson
takes
to
bed
with
him
a
copy
of
every
book
printed
in
the
united
kingdom
is
or
i
had
better
say
should
be
deposited
with
him
putting
aside
the
question
of
what
he
has
done
to
deserve
it
he
must
surely
wonder
at
times
from
what
other
corners
of
the
earth
providence
has
been
at
pains
to
collect
and
compact
the
ingredients
of
the
latest
new
volume
he
handles
for
a
moment
before
fondly
committing
it
to
the
cellars
up
not
lost
or
to
take
it
in
reverse
when
the
great
library
of
alexandria
went
up
in
flames
doubtless
its
ashes
awoke
an
appreciable
and
almost
immediate
energy
in
the
crops
of
the
nile
delta
the
more
leisurable
process
of
desiccation
by
which
under
modern
storage
the
components
of
a
modern
novel
are
released
to
fresh
unions
and
activities
admits
as
sir
thomas
browne
would
say
a
wide
solution
and
was
just
the
question
to
tease
that
good
man
can
we
not
hear
him
discussing
it
be
but
pyramidally
extant
is
a
fallacy
in
duration
to
burn
the
bones
of
the
king
of
edom
for
lime
seems
no
irrational
ferity
but
to
store
the
back
volumes
of
mr
bottomley
john
bull
a
passionate
prodigality
ii
well
whatever
the
perplexities
of
our
library
we
may
be
sure
they
will
never
break
down
that
tradition
of
service
help
and
courtesy
which
is
among
its
fine
treasures
still
the
first
but
we
have
seen
that
mr
jenkinson
perplexities
are
really
but
a
parable
of
ours
that
the
question
what
are
we
to
do
with
all
these
books
accumulating
in
the
world
really
a
question
that
their
mere
accumulation
really
heap
up
against
us
a
barrier
of
such
enormous
and
brute
mass
that
the
stream
of
human
culture
must
needs
be
choked
and
spread
into
marsh
unless
we
contrive
to
pipe
it
through
that
a
great
deal
of
it
is
meant
to
help
that
even
the
most
of
it
is
well
intentioned
avails
not
against
the
mere
physical
obstacle
of
its
mass
if
you
consider
an
athenian
gentleman
of
the
century
connecting
as
i
always
preach
here
his
literature
with
his
life
two
things
are
bound
to
strike
you
the
first
that
he
was
a
man
of
leisure
somewhat
disdainful
of
trade
and
relieved
of
menial
work
by
a
number
of
slaves
the
second
that
he
was
surprisingly
unencumbered
with
books
you
will
find
in
plato
much
about
reciters
actors
poets
rhetoricians
pleaders
sophists
public
orators
and
refiners
of
language
but
very
little
indeed
about
books
even
the
library
of
alexandria
grew
in
a
time
of
decadence
and
belonged
to
an
age
not
his
says
jowett
in
the
end
he
who
approaches
him
in
the
most
reverent
spirit
shall
reap
most
of
the
fruit
of
his
wisdom
he
who
reads
him
by
the
light
of
ancient
commentators
will
have
the
least
understanding
of
him
we
see
him
jowett
goes
on
with
the
eye
of
the
mind
in
the
groves
of
the
academy
or
on
the
banks
of
the
ilissus
or
in
the
streets
of
athens
alone
or
walking
with
socrates
full
of
those
thoughts
which
have
since
become
the
common
possession
of
mankind
or
we
may
compare
him
to
a
statue
hid
away
in
some
temple
of
zeus
or
apollo
no
longer
existing
on
earth
a
statue
which
has
a
look
as
of
the
god
himself
or
we
may
once
more
imagine
him
following
in
another
state
of
being
the
great
company
of
heaven
which
he
beheld
of
old
in
a
vision
so
trifling
but
with
a
certain
degree
of
seriousness
we
linger
around
the
memory
of
a
world
which
has
passed
away
yes
has
passed
away
and
perhaps
with
no
token
more
evident
of
its
decease
than
the
sepulture
of
books
that
admiring
generations
have
heaped
on
it
iii
in
a
previous
lecture
i
referred
you
to
the
beautiful
opening
and
the
yet
more
beautiful
close
of
the
phaedrus
let
us
turn
back
and
refresh
ourselves
with
that
dialogue
while
we
learn
from
it
in
somewhat
more
of
detail
just
what
a
book
meant
to
an
athenian
how
fresh
a
thing
it
was
to
him
and
how
little
irksome
phaedrus
has
spent
his
forenoon
listening
to
a
discourse
by
the
celebrated
rhetorician
lysias
on
the
subject
of
love
and
is
starting
to
cool
his
head
with
a
stroll
beyond
the
walls
of
the
city
when
he
encounters
socrates
who
will
not
let
him
go
until
he
has
delivered
up
the
speech
with
which
lysias
regaled
him
or
better
still
the
manuscript
i
suspect
you
are
carrying
there
in
your
left
hand
under
your
cloak
so
they
bend
their
way
beside
ilissus
towards
a
tall
plane
tree
seen
in
the
distance
having
reached
it
they
recline
hera
says
socrates
fair
full
of
summer
sounds
and
scents
this
clearing
with
the
agnus
castus
in
high
bloom
and
fragrant
and
the
stream
beneath
the
tree
so
gratefully
cool
to
our
feet
judging
from
the
ornaments
and
statues
i
think
this
spot
must
be
sacred
to
acheloüs
and
the
nymphs
and
the
breeze
how
deliciously
charged
with
balm
and
all
summer
murmur
in
the
air
shrilled
by
the
chorus
of
the
grasshoppers
but
the
greatest
charm
is
this
knoll
of
turf
positively
a
pillow
for
the
head
my
dear
phaedrus
you
have
been
a
delectable
guide
an
incomprehensible
being
you
are
socrates
returns
phaedrus
you
are
in
the
country
as
you
say
you
really
are
like
some
stranger
led
about
by
a
guide
upon
my
word
i
doubt
if
you
ever
stray
beyond
the
gates
save
by
accident
true
my
friend
and
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
the
reason
which
is
that
i
love
knowledge
and
my
teachers
are
the
men
who
dwell
in
the
city
not
the
trees
or
country
scenes
yet
i
do
believe
you
have
found
a
spell
to
draw
me
forth
like
a
hungry
cow
before
whom
a
bough
or
a
bunch
of
fruit
is
waved
for
only
hold
up
before
me
in
like
manner
a
book
and
you
may
lead
me
all
round
attica
and
over
the
wide
world
so
they
recline
and
talk
looking
aloft
through
that
famous
pure
sky
of
attica
mile
upon
mile
transparent
and
their
discourse
preserved
to
us
is
of
love
and
seems
to
belong
to
that
atmosphere
so
clear
it
is
and
luminously
profound
it
ends
with
the
cool
of
the
day
and
the
two
friends
arise
to
depart
socrates
looks
about
him
we
not
before
going
offer
up
a
prayer
to
these
local
deities
all
means
phaedrus
agrees
praying
pan
and
all
ye
other
gods
who
haunt
this
place
grant
me
beauty
in
the
inward
soul
and
that
the
outward
and
inward
may
be
at
one
may
i
esteem
the
wise
to
be
the
rich
and
may
i
myself
have
that
quantity
of
gold
which
a
temperate
man
and
he
only
can
carry
anything
more
that
prayer
i
think
is
enough
for
me
the
same
for
me
socrates
friends
methinks
should
have
all
things
in
common
then
let
us
go
here
we
have
as
it
seems
to
me
a
marriage
without
impediment
of
wisdom
and
beauty
between
two
minds
that
perforce
have
small
acquaintance
with
books
and
yet
with
it
socrates
confession
that
anyone
with
a
book
under
his
cloak
could
lead
him
anywhere
by
the
nose
so
we
see
that
hellenic
culture
at
its
best
was
independent
of
and
yet
craved
for
it
iv
when
our
own
literature
awoke
taking
its
origin
from
the
proud
scholarship
of
the
renaissance
an
englishman
who
affected
it
was
scarcely
more
cumbered
with
books
than
our
athenian
had
been
two
thousand
years
before
it
was
and
it
remained
aristocratic
sparingly
expensive
of
its
culture
it
postulated
if
not
a
slave
population
at
least
a
proletariat
for
which
its
blessings
were
not
no
one
thought
of
making
a
fortune
by
disseminating
his
work
in
print
shakespeare
never
found
it
worth
while
to
collect
and
publish
his
plays
and
a
very
small
sense
of
history
will
suffice
to
check
our
tears
over
the
price
received
by
milton
for
paradise
lost
we
may
wonder
indeed
at
the
time
it
took
our
forefathers
to
realise
or
at
any
rate
to
employ
the
energy
that
lay
in
the
for
centuries
after
its
invention
mere
copying
commanded
far
higher
prices
than
authorship
writers
gave
editions
to
the
world
sometimes
for
the
sake
of
fame
often
to
justify
themselves
against
piratical
publishers
seldom
in
expectation
of
monetary
profit
listen
for
example
to
sir
thomas
browne
excuse
for
publishing
religio
medici
had
not
almost
every
man
suffered
by
the
press
or
were
not
the
tyranny
thereof
become
universal
i
had
not
wanted
reason
for
complaint
but
in
times
wherein
i
have
lived
to
behold
the
highest
perversion
of
that
excellent
invention
the
name
of
his
majesty
defamed
the
honour
of
parliament
depraved
the
writings
of
both
depravedly
anticipatively
counterfeitly
imprinted
complaints
may
seem
ridiculous
in
private
persons
and
men
of
my
condition
may
be
as
incapable
of
affronts
as
hopeless
of
their
reparations
and
truly
had
not
the
duty
i
owe
unto
the
importunity
of
friends
and
the
allegiance
i
must
ever
acknowledge
unto
truth
prevailed
with
me
the
inactivity
of
my
disposition
might
have
made
these
sufferings
continual
and
time
that
brings
other
things
to
light
should
have
satisfied
me
in
the
remedy
of
its
oblivion
but
because
things
evidently
false
are
not
only
printed
but
many
things
of
truth
most
falsely
set
forth
in
this
latter
i
could
not
but
think
myself
engaged
for
though
we
have
no
power
to
redress
the
former
yet
in
the
other
the
reparation
being
within
our
selves
i
have
at
present
represented
unto
the
world
a
full
and
intended
copy
of
that
piece
which
was
most
imperfectly
and
surreptitiously
published
before
this
i
confess
about
seven
years
past
with
some
others
of
affinity
thereto
for
my
private
exercise
and
satisfaction
i
had
at
leisurable
hours
composed
which
being
communicated
unto
one
it
became
common
unto
many
and
was
by
transcription
successively
corrupted
untill
it
arrived
in
a
most
depraved
copy
at
the
press
v
the
men
of
the
century
maintained
the
old
tradition
of
literary
exclusiveness
but
in
a
somewhat
different
way
and
more
consciously
i
find
gentlemen
when
you
read
with
me
in
private
that
nine
out
of
ten
of
you
dislike
the
century
and
all
its
literary
works
as
for
the
women
students
they
one
and
all
abominate
it
you
do
not
i
regret
to
say
provide
me
with
reasons
much
more
philosophical
than
the
epigrammatist
for
disliking
doctor
fell
may
one
whose
time
of
life
excuses
perhaps
a
detachment
from
passion
attempt
to
provide
you
with
one
if
so
first
listen
to
this
from
mr
and
mrs
hammond
book
the
village
labourer
a
row
of
century
houses
or
a
room
of
normal
century
furniture
or
a
characteristic
piece
of
century
literature
conveys
at
once
a
sensation
of
satisfaction
and
completeness
the
secret
of
this
charm
is
not
to
be
found
in
any
special
beauty
or
nobility
of
design
or
expression
but
simply
in
an
exquisite
fitness
the
century
mind
was
a
unity
an
order
all
literature
and
art
that
really
belong
to
the
century
are
the
language
of
a
little
society
of
men
and
women
who
moved
within
one
set
of
ideas
who
understood
each
other
who
were
not
tormented
by
any
anxious
or
bewildering
problems
who
lived
in
comfort
and
above
all
things
in
composure
the
classics
were
their
freemasonry
there
was
a
standard
for
the
mind
for
the
emotions
for
taste
there
were
no
incongruities
when
you
have
a
society
like
this
you
have
what
we
roughly
call
a
civilisation
and
it
leaves
its
character
and
canons
in
all
its
surroundings
and
in
its
literature
its
definite
ideas
lend
themselves
readily
to
expression
a
larger
society
seems
an
anarchy
in
contrast
just
because
of
its
escape
into
a
greater
world
it
seems
powerless
to
stamp
itself
in
wood
or
stone
it
is
condemned
as
an
age
of
chaos
and
mutiny
with
nothing
to
declare
you
do
wrong
i
assure
you
in
misprising
these
men
of
the
century
they
reduced
life
to
be
sure
but
by
that
very
means
they
saw
it
far
more
than
do
we
in
this
lyrical
age
with
our
worship
of
excess
here
at
any
rate
and
to
speak
only
of
its
literature
you
have
a
society
fencing
that
literature
around
i
do
not
say
by
forethought
or
even
consciously
but
in
effect
fencing
its
literature
around
to
keep
it
in
control
and
capable
of
an
orderly
a
nice
even
an
exquisite
cultivation
dislike
it
as
you
may
i
do
not
think
that
any
of
you
as
he
increases
his
knowledge
of
the
technique
of
english
prose
yes
and
of
english
verse
i
do
not
say
of
english
poetry
will
deny
his
admiration
to
the
men
of
the
century
the
strength
of
good
prose
resides
not
so
much
in
the
swing
and
balance
of
the
single
sentence
as
in
the
marshalling
of
argument
the
orderly
procession
of
paragraphs
the
disposition
of
parts
so
that
each
finds
its
telling
its
proper
place
the
adjustment
of
the
means
to
the
end
the
strategy
which
brings
its
full
force
into
action
at
the
calculated
moment
and
drives
the
conclusion
home
upon
an
accumulated
sense
of
i
do
not
see
how
any
student
of
century
literature
can
deny
its
writers
berkeley
or
hume
or
gibbon
congreve
or
sheridan
pope
or
cowper
addison
or
steele
or
johnson
burke
or
chatham
or
thomas
paine
their
meed
for
this
or
if
he
be
an
artist
even
his
homage
but
it
remains
true
as
your
instinct
tells
you
and
as
i
have
admitted
that
they
achieved
all
this
by
help
of
narrow
and
artificial
boundaries
of
several
fatal
exclusions
let
me
name
but
two
in
the
first
place
they
excluded
the
poor
imitating
in
a
late
age
the
athenian
tradition
of
a
small
polite
society
resting
on
a
large
and
degraded
one
throughout
the
century
and
the
great
whig
families
were
at
least
as
much
to
blame
for
this
as
the
tories
by
enclosure
of
commons
by
grants
by
handling
of
the
franchise
by
taxation
by
poor
laws
in
result
punitive
though
intended
to
be
palliative
the
english
peasantry
underwent
a
steady
process
of
degradation
into
serfdom
into
a
serfdom
which
during
the
first
twenty
years
of
the
next
century
hung
constantly
and
precariously
on
the
edge
of
actual
starvation
the
whole
theory
of
culture
worked
upon
a
principle
of
double
restriction
of
restricting
on
the
one
hand
the
realm
of
polite
knowledge
to
propositions
suitable
for
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
and
on
the
other
the
numbers
of
the
human
family
permitted
to
be
either
the
theory
deprecated
enthusiasm
as
it
discountenanced
all
ambition
in
a
poor
child
to
rise
above
what
sir
spencer
walpole
called
inevitable
and
hereditary
lot
to
soften
which
and
make
him
acquiescent
in
it
was
with
a
wilberforce
or
a
hannah
more
the
last
dream
of
restless
benevolence
vi
also
these
century
men
fenced
off
the
whole
of
our
own
middle
english
and
medieval
literature
fenced
off
chaucer
and
dunbar
malory
and
berners
as
barbarous
and
they
treated
these
writers
with
little
more
consideration
than
boileau
had
thought
it
worth
while
to
bestow
on
villon
or
on
ronsard
as
for
literature
one
may
safely
say
that
save
by
gray
and
a
very
few
others
its
existence
was
barely
surmised
you
may
or
may
not
find
it
harder
to
forgive
them
that
they
ruled
out
moreover
a
great
part
of
the
literature
of
the
preceding
century
as
offensive
to
urbane
taste
or
as
they
would
say
they
disliked
it
mainly
one
suspects
as
one
age
revolts
from
the
fashion
of
another
as
some
of
you
for
example
revolt
from
the
broad
plenty
of
dickens
heaven
forgive
you
or
the
ornament
of
tennyson
some
of
the
great
writers
of
that
age
definitely
excluded
god
from
their
scheme
of
things
others
included
god
fiercely
but
with
circumscription
and
limitation
i
think
it
fair
to
say
of
them
generally
that
they
hated
alike
the
mystical
and
the
mysterious
and
hating
these
could
have
little
commerce
with
such
poetry
as
crashaw
and
vaughan
or
such
speculation
as
gave
ardour
to
the
prose
of
the
cambridge
platonists
johnson
famous
attack
in
his
life
of
cowley
upon
the
metaphysical
followers
of
donne
ostensibly
assails
their
literary
conceits
but
truly
and
at
bottom
rests
its
quarrel
against
an
attitude
of
mind
in
respect
of
which
he
lived
far
enough
removed
to
be
unsympathetic
yet
near
enough
to
take
denunciation
for
a
duty
johnson
to
put
it
vulgarly
had
as
little
use
for
vaughan
notion
of
poetry
as
he
would
have
had
for
shelley
claim
that
it
feeds
on
the
aëreal
kisses
of
shapes
that
haunt
thought
wildernesses
and
we
have
only
to
set
ourselves
back
in
shelley
age
and
read
say
the
verse
of
frere
and
canning
in
the
to
understand
how
frantic
a
lyrist
let
be
how
frantic
a
political
figure
shelley
must
have
appeared
to
minds
vii
all
this
literature
which
our
forefathers
excluded
has
come
back
upon
us
and
concurrently
we
have
to
deal
with
the
more
serious
difficulty
let
us
give
thanks
for
it
of
a
multitude
of
millions
insurgent
to
handsel
their
heritage
i
shall
waste
no
time
in
arguing
that
we
ought
not
to
wish
to
withhold
it
because
we
can
not
if
we
would
and
thus
the
problem
becomes
a
double
one
of
as
well
as
of
now
in
the
first
place
i
submit
that
this
should
be
free
which
implies
that
our
must
be
confined
to
books
and
methods
of
teaching
there
must
be
no
picking
and
choosing
among
the
recipients
no
appropriation
of
certain
forms
of
culture
to
certain
of
life
with
a
tendency
conscious
or
unconscious
to
keep
those
stations
as
stationary
as
possible
merely
by
clearing
our
purpose
to
this
extent
we
shall
have
made
no
inconsiderable
advance
for
even
the
last
century
never
quite
got
rid
of
its
predecessor
fixed
idea
that
certain
degrees
of
culture
were
appropriate
to
certain
stations
of
life
with
what
gentle
persistence
it
prevails
for
example
in
jane
novels
with
what
complacent
rhetoric
in
tennyson
and
in
spite
of
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
let
me
remind
you
that
by
allowing
an
idea
to
take
hold
of
our
animosity
we
may
be
as
truly
by
it
as
though
it
claimed
our
allegiance
the
notion
that
culture
may
be
drilled
to
march
in
step
with
a
trade
or
calling
endured
through
the
victorian
age
of
competition
and
possessed
the
mind
not
only
of
samuel
smiles
who
taught
by
instances
how
a
bright
and
industrious
boy
might
earn
money
and
lift
himself
out
of
his
but
of
ruskin
himself
who
in
the
first
half
of
sesame
and
lilies
in
the
lecture
of
treasuries
discussing
the
choice
of
books
starts
vehemently
and
proceeds
at
length
to
denounce
the
prevalent
passion
for
of
rising
above
one
station
in
life
quite
as
if
it
were
the
most
important
thing
in
talking
of
the
choice
of
books
which
means
that
to
ruskin
just
then
it
was
the
most
formidable
obstacle
can
we
at
this
time
of
day
do
better
by
simply
turning
the
notion
out
of
doors
yes
i
believe
that
we
can
and
upon
this
believe
that
while
it
may
grow
and
grow
infinitely
with
increase
of
learning
the
grace
of
a
liberal
education
like
the
grace
of
christianity
is
so
catholic
a
thing
so
absolutely
above
being
trafficked
retailed
apportioned
among
in
life
that
the
humblest
child
may
claim
it
by
indefeasible
right
having
a

that
humanism
is
or
should
he
no
decorative
appanage
purchased
late
in
the
process
of
education
within
the
means
of
a

but
a
quality
rather
which
should
and
can
condition
all
teaching

i
am
not
preaching
red
radicalism
in
this
i
am
not
telling
you
that
jack
is
as
good
as
his
master
if
he
were
he
would
be
a
great
deal
better
for
he
would
understand
homer
say
as
well
as
his
master
the
child
of
parents
who
could
afford
to
have
him
taught
greek
as
greek
is
commonly
taught
i
regret
to
say
whether
they
have
learnt
it
or
not
makes
a
distressingly
small
difference
to
most
boys
appreciation
of
homer
still
it
does
make
a
vast
difference
to
some
and
should
make
a
vast
difference
to
all
and
yet
if
you
will
read
the
passage
in
eöthen
in
which
he
tells
in
words
that
find
their
echo
in
many
a
reader
memory
of
his
boyish
passion
for
homer
and
if
you
will
note
that
the
boy
imbibed
his
passion
after
all
through
the
conduit
of
pope
translation
you
will
acknowledge
that
for
the
human
boy
admission
to
much
of
the
glory
of
homer
realm
does
not
depend
upon
such
mastery
as
a
boy
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
possesses
over
the
original
but
let
me
quote
you
a
few
sentences
i
too
loved
homer
but
not
with
a
scholar
love
the
most
humble
and
pious
among
women
was
yet
so
proud
a
mother
that
she
could
teach
her
son
no
watts
hymns
no
collects
for
the
day
she
could
teach
him
in
earliest
childhood
no
less
than
this
to
find
a
home
in
his
saddle
and
to
love
old
homer
and
all
that
old
homer
sung
true
it
is
that
the
greek
was
ingeniously
rendered
into
english
the
english
of
pope
even
but
not
even
a
mesh
like
that
can
screen
an
earnest
child
from
the
fire
of
homer
battles
i
pored
over
the
odyssey
as
over
a
hoping
and
fearing
for
the
hero
whom
yet
i
partly
scorned
but
the
iliad
line
by
line
i
clasped
it
to
my
brain
with
reverence
as
well
as
with
love
the
impatient
child
is
not
grubbing
for
beauties
but
pushing
the
siege
the
women
vex
him
with
their
delays
and
their
talking
but
all
the
while
that
he
thus
chafes
at
the
pausing
of
the
action
the
strong
vertical
light
of
homer
poetry
is
blazing
so
full
upon
the
people
and
things
of
the
iliad
that
soon
to
the
eyes
of
the
child
they
grow
familiar
as
his
mother
shawl
it
was
not
the
recollection
of
school
nor
college
learning
but
the
rapturous
and
earnest
reading
of
my
childhood
which
made
me
bend
forward
so
longingly
to
the
plains
of
troy
ix
it
is
among
the
books
then
and
not
among
the
readers
that
we
must
do
our
selecting
but
how
on
what
principle
or
principles
sometime
in
the
days
of
my
youth
a
newspaper
the
pall
mall
gazette
then
conducted
by
stead
made
a
conscientious
effort
to
solve
the
riddle
by
inviting
a
number
of
eminent
men
to
compile
lists
of
the
hundred
best
books
now
this
invitation
rested
on
a
fallacy
considering
for
a
moment
how
personal
a
thing
is
literature
you
will
promptly
assure
yourselves
that
there
is
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
the
hundred
best
books
if
you
yet
incline
to
toy
with
the
notion
carry
it
on
and
compile
a
list
of
the
hundred
books
nay
if
you
will
continue
until
you
find
yourself
solemnly
with
a
brow
corrugated
by
responsibility
weighing
the
claims
say
of
velleius
paterculus
paul
and
virginia
and
mr
jorrocks
to
admission
among
the
hundred
books
there
is
in
fact
no
positive
hierarchy
among
the
classics
you
can
not
appraise
the
worth
of
charles
lamb
against
the
worth
of
casaubon
the
worth
of
hesiod
against
the
worth
of
madame
de
sévigné
the
worth
of
théophile
gautier
against
the
worth
of
dante
or
thomas
hobbes
or
macchiavelli
or
jane
austen
they
all
wrote
with
pens
in
ink
upon
paper
but
you
no
sooner
pass
beyond
these
resemblances
than
your
comparison
finds
itself
working
in
impari
materia
also
why
should
the
best
books
be
in
number
rather
than
or
and
under
what
conditions
is
a
book
a
best
book
there
are
moods
in
which
we
not
only
prefer
pickwick
to
the
or
sakuntalà
but
find
that
it
does
us
more
good
in
our
day

was
a
large

vigorously

in
the
nature
of

everyman
is
going
to
arrive
at
a
point
beyond
which
he
will
find
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
recognise
himself
at
a
point
let
us
say
when
everyman

to

however
we
teach
our
trust
will
in
the
end
repose
upon
masterpieces
upon
the
great
classics
of
whatever
language
or
literature
we
are
handling
and
these
in
any
language
are
neither
enormous
in
number

nor
extraordinarily
difficult
to
detect
nor
best

we
may
teach
at

a
surmise
of
the
true
delight
and
may
be
some
measure
of
taste
whereby
our
pupil
will
by
an
inner
guide
be
warned
to
choose
the
better
and
reject
the
worse

i
i
do
not
think
gentlemen
that
we
need
to
bother
ourselves
today
with
any
definition
of
a
or
of
the
by
which
a
true
classic
can
be
recognised
once
indicated
these
in
a
famous
discourse
classique
and
it
may
suffice
us
that
these
include
universality
and
permanence
your
true
classic
is
in
that
it
appeals
to
the
catholic
mind
of
man
it
is
doubly
for
it
remains
significant
or
acquires
a
new
significance
after
the
age
for
which
it
was
written
and
the
conditions
under
which
it
was
written
have
passed
away
and
it
yet
keeps
undefaced
by
handling
the
original
noble
imprint
of
the
mind
that
first
minted
it
or
shall
we
say
that
as
generation
after
generation
rings
the
coin
it
ever
returns
the
echo
of
its
but
for
our
purpose
it
suffices
that
in
our
literature
we
possess
a
number
of
works
to
which
the
title
of
classic
can
not
be
refused
so
let
us
confine
ourselves
to
these
and
to
the
question
how
to
use
them
ii
well
to
begin
with
i
revert
to
a
point
which
i
tried
to
establish
in
my
first
lecture
and
insist
with
all
my
strength
that
the
first
obligation
we
owe
to
any
classic
and
to
those
whom
we
teach
and
to
ourselves
is
to
treat
it
not
for
any
secondary
or
derivative
purpose
or
purpose
recommended
as
useful
by
any
manual
but
at
first
solely
to
interpret
the
meaning
which
its
author
intended
that
in
short
we
should
any
given
masterpiece
for
its
operation
on
ourselves
and
on
others
in
that
first
lecture
i
quoted
to
you
this
most
wise
sentence
that
all
spirit
is
mutually
attractive
as
all
matter
is
mutually
attractive
is
an
ultimate
fact
and
consenting
to
this
with
all
my
heart
i
say
that
it
matters
very
little
for
the
moment
or
even
for
a
considerable
while
that
a
pupil
does
not
perfectly
or
even
nearly
understand
all
he
reads
provided
we
can
get
the
attraction
to
seize
upon
him
he
and
the
author
between
them
will
do
the
rest
our
function
is
to
communicate
and
trust
in
what
other
way
do
children
take
the
ineffaceable
stamp
of
a
gentle
nurture
than
by
daily
attraction
to
whatsoever
is
beautiful
and
amiable
and
dignified
in
their
home
as
there
so
in
their
reading
the
process
must
be
gradual
of
acquiring
an
inbred
monitor
to
reject
the
evil
and
choose
the
good
for
it
is
the
property
of
masterpieces
that
they
not
only
raise
you
to
despise
low
joys
low
gains
disdain
whatever
cornbury
disdains
they
are
not
only
as
lamb
wrote
of
the
plays
of
shakespeare
of
the
fancy
strengtheners
of
virtue
a
withdrawing
from
all
selfish
and
mercenary
thoughts
a
lesson
of
all
sweet
and
honourable
thoughts
and
actions
to
teach
you
courtesy
benignity
generosity
humanity
but
they
raise
your
gorge
to
defend
you
from
swallowing
the
the
sham
the
fraudulent
studia
in
i
can
not
for
my
part
conceive
a
man
who
has
once
incorporated
the
phaedo
or
the
paradiso
or
lear
in
himself
as
lending
himself
for
a
moment
to
one
or
other
of
the
follies
plastered
in
these
late
stern
times
upon
the
firm
and
most
solid
purpose
of
this
nation
the
inanities
let
us
say
of
a
or
for
a
more
damnable
instance
i
think
of
you
and
me
with
marvell
great
horatian
ode
sunk
in
our
minds
standing
by
the
statue
of
charles
i
that
looks
down
whitehall
telling
ourselves
of
memorable
scene
before
the
banqueting
house
remembering
amid
old
woes
all
the
glory
of
our
blood
and
state
recollecting
what
is
due
even
to
ourselves
standing
on
the
greatest
site
of
our
capital
and
turning
to
see
it
degraded
as
it
has
been
for
a
week
to
a
vulgar
gentlemen
i
could
read
you
many
poor
letters
from
mothers
whose
sons
have
died
for
england
to
prove
to
you
we
have
not
deserved
or
the
sort
of
placard
with
which
london
has
been
plastered
dum

accolet
great
enterprises
as
we
know
and
little
minds
go
ill
together
someone
veiled
the
statue
that
at
least
was
well
done
i
have
not
the
information
nor
do
i
want
it
to
make
even
a
guess
who
was
responsible
for
this
particular
outrage
i
know
the
sort
of
man
well
enough
to
venture
that
he
never
had
a
liberal
education
and
further
that
he
is
probably
rather
proud
of
it
but
he
may
nevertheless
own
some
instinct
of
primitive
kindliness
and
i
wish
he
could
know
how
he
afflicts
men
of
sensitiveness
who
have
sons
at
the
war
iii
secondly
let
us
consider
what
use
we
can
make
of
even
one
selected
classic
i
refer
you
back
to
the
work
of
an
old
schoolmaster
quoted
in
my
first
lecture
i
believe
if
the
truth
were
known
men
would
be
astonished
at
the
small
amount
of
learning
with
which
a
high
degree
of
culture
is
compatible
in
a
moment
of
enthusiasm
i
ventured
once
to
tell
my
set
that
if
they
could
really
master
the
ninth
book
of
paradise
lost
so
as
to
rise
to
the
height
of
its
great
argument
and
incorporate
all
its
beauties
in
themselves
they
would
at
one
blow
by
virtue
of
that
alone
become
highly
cultivated
men
more
and
more
various
learning
might
raise
them
to
the
same
height
by
different
paths
but
could
hardly
raise
them
higher
i
beg
your
attention
for
the
exact
words
rise
to
the
height
of
its
great
argument
and
all
its
beauties
in
there
you
have
it
incorporate
do
you
remember
that
saying
of
wordsworth
casually
dropped
in
conversation
but
preserved
for
us
by
hazlitt
is
in
the
highest
degree
unphilosophic
to
call
language
or
diction
the
dress
of
our
thoughts
it
is
the
of
our
thoughts
even
so
i
maintain
to
you
the
first
business
of
a
learner
in
literature
is
to
get
complete
hold
of
some
undeniable
masterpiece
and
incorporate
it
incarnate
it
and
i
repeat
there
are
a
few
great
works
for
you
to
choose
from
works
approved
for
you
by
ancient
and
catholic
judgment
iv
but
let
us
take
something
far
simpler
than
the
ninth
book
of
paradise
lost
and
more
direct
than
any
translated
masterpiece
can
be
in
its
appeal
something
of
high
genius
written
in
our
mother
tongue
let
us
take
the
tempest
of
the
tempest
we
may
say
confidently
that
it
is
a
literary
masterpiece
the
last
most
perfect
of
the
noblest
tree
in
our
english
forest
that
its
story
is
quite
simple
intelligible
to
a
child
its
basis
in
fact
is
pure
and
simple
as
i
tried
to
show
in
a
previous
lecture
that
in
reading
it
or
in
reading
hamlet
for
that
matter
the
child
has
no
sense
at
all
of
being
patronised
of
being
down
to
and
this
has
the
strongest
bearing
on
my
argument
the
great
authors
as
emerson
says
never
condescend
shakespeare
himself
speaks
to
a
slip
of
a
boy
and
that
boy
feels
that
he
ferdinand
that
though
shakespeare
uses
his
loftiest
most
accomplished
and
in
a
sense
his
most
difficult
language
a
way
of
talking
it
has
cost
him
a
to
acquire
in
line
upon
line
inviting
the
scholar
prosodist
poet
most
careful
study
that
language
is
no
bar
to
the
child
enjoyment
but
rather
casts
about
the
whole
play
an
aura
of
magnificence
which
with
the
assistant
harmonies
doubles
and
redoubles
the
spell
a
child
no
more
resents
this
because
it
is
strange
than
he
objects
to
read
in
a
fairytale
of
robbers
concealed
in
or
of
diamonds
big
as
a
roc
egg
when
will
our
educators
see
that
what
a
child
depends
on
is
imagination
that
what
he
demands
of
life
is
the
wonderful
the
glittering
possibility
now
if
putting
all
this
together
and
taking
confidence
from
it
we
boldly
launch
a
child
upon
the
tempest
we
shall
come
sooner
or
later
upon
passages
that
have
arrived
at
finding
difficult
we
shall
come
for
example
to
the
masque
of
iris
which
iris
invoking
ceres
thus
opens
ceres
most
bounteous
lady
thy
rich
leas
of
wheat
rye
barley
vetches
oats
and
pease
thy
turfy
mountains
where
live
nibbling
sheep
and
flat
meads
thatched
with
stover
them
to
keep
thy
banks
with
pionèd
and
twillèd
brims
which
spongy
april
at
thy
hest
betrims
to
make
cold
nymphs
chaste
crowns
and
thy
whose
shadow
the
dismisséd
bachelor
loves
being
thy
vineyard
and
thy
sterile
and
rocky
hard
where
thou
thyself
dost
air
the
queen
o
th
sky
whose
watry
arch
and
messenger
am
i
bids
thee
leave
these
the
passage
is
undeniably
hard
for
any
child
even
when
you
have
paused
to
explain
who
ceres
is
who
iris
who
the
queen
o
the
sky
and
what
iris
means
by
calling
herself
watery
arch
and
messenger
the
grammatical
structure
not
only
stands
on
its
head
but
maintains
that
posture
for
an
extravagant
while
naturally
or
rather
let
us
say
ordinarily
it
would
run
the
queen
o
the
sky
bids
thee
leave
thy
rich
leas
etc
but
the
lines
being
in
number
we
get
no
hint
of
there
being
any
grammatical
subject
until
it
bursts
on
us
in
the
second
half
of
line
eleven
while
the
two
main
verbs
and
the
object
of
one
of
them
yet
linger
to
be
exploded
in
the
last
thee
leave
these
and
this
again
is
as
nothing
to
the
difficulties
of
interpretation
bachelor
may
be
easy
vineyard
is
certainly
not
at
first
sight
make
cold
nymphs
chaste
crowns
what
cold
nymphs
you
have
to
wait
for
another
fifty
odd
lines
before
being
quite
sure
that
shakespeare
means
naiads
and
are
naiads
says
the
child
nymphs
you
nymphs
called
naiads
of
the
windring
brooks
with
your
sedged
crowns
and
if
the
child
demand
what
is
meant
by
and
twillèd
brims
you
have
to
answer
him
that
nobody
knows
these
difficulties
perhaps
for
you
certainly
for
the
young
reader
or
listener
are
reserved
delights
my
old
schoolmaster
even
indulges
this
suspicion
never
can
persuade
myself
that
shakespeare
would
have
passed
high
in
a
civil
service
examination
on
one
of
his
own
plays
at
any
rate
you
do
with
these
difficulties
you
do
or
i
hope
you
do
read
the
notes
first
since
as
bacon
puts
it
teach
not
their
own
use
as
for
the
child
he
is
not
for
beauties
he
magnificently
ignores
what
he
can
not
for
the
moment
understand
being
intent
on
is
the
heart
and
secret
of
the
adventure
he
ferdinand
i
repeat
and
the
isle
is
of
voices
if
these
voices
were
all
intelligible
why
then
as
browning
would
say
less
island
it
v
i
have
purposely
exhibited
the
tempest
at
its
least
tractable
who
will
deny
that
a
it
can
be
made
intelligible
even
to
very
young
children
by
the
simple
process
of
reading
it
with
them
intelligently
or
that
the
mysteries
such
a
reading
leaves
unexplained
are
of
the
sort
to
fascinate
a
child
mind
and
allure
it
but
if
this
be
granted
i
have
established
my
contention
that
the
humanities
should
not
be
treated
as
a
mere
crown
and
ornament
of
education
that
they
should
inform
every
part
of
it
from
the
beginning
in
every
school
of
the
realm
that
whether
a
child
have
more
education
or
less
education
what
he
has
can
be
and
should
be
a
education
throughout
matthew
arnold
as
every
one
knows
used
to
preach
the
use
of
these
masterpieces
as
prophylactics
of
taste
i
would
i
could
make
you
feel
that
they
are
even
more
necessary
to
us
the
reason
why
the
reason
is
that
every
child
born
in
these
islands
is
born
into
a
democracy
which
apart
from
home
affairs
stands
committed
to
a
high
responsibility
for
the
future
welfare
and
good
governance
of
europe
for
three
centuries
or
so
it
has
held
rule
over
vast
stretches
of
the
earth
surface
and
many
millions
of
strange
peoples
while
its
obligations
towards
the
general
civilisation
of
europe
if
not
intermittent
have
been
tightened
or
relaxed
now
here
now
there
by
policy
by
commerce
by
dynastic
alliances
by
sudden
revulsions
or
sympathies
but
this
war
will
leave
us
bound
to
europe
as
we
never
have
been
and
whether
we
like
it
or
not
no
less
inextricably
bound
to
foe
than
to
friend
therefore
i
say
it
has
become
important
and
in
a
far
higher
degree
than
it
ever
was
before
the
war
that
our
countrymen
grow
up
with
a
sense
of
what
i
may
call
the
of
europe
and
nowhere
but
in
literature
which
is
speech
or
at
any
rate
nowhere
so
well
as
in
literature
can
they
find
this
sense
vi
there
was
as
we
have
seen
a
time
in
europe
extending
over
many
centuries
when
mankind
dwelt
under
the
preoccupation
of
making
literature
and
still
making
more
of
it
the
century
in
athens
was
such
a
time
and
if
you
will
you
may
envy
as
we
all
admire
the
men
of
an
age
when
to
write
at
all
was
tantamount
to
asserting
genius
the
men
who
in
newman
words
to
be
classics
both
because
of
what
they
do
and
because
they
can
do
it
if
you
envy
while
you
envy
at
least
remember
that
these
things
often
paid
their
price
that
the
phaedo
for
example
was
bought
for
us
by
the
death
of
socrates
pass
athens
and
come
to
alexandria
still
men
are
accumulating
books
and
the
material
for
books
threshing
out
the
classics
into
commentaries
and
grammars
garnering
books
in
great
libraries
there
follows
an
age
which
interrupts
this
labour
with
sudden
and
insensate
destruction
german
tribes
from
the
north
turkish
from
the
east
break
in
upon
the
granaries
and
send
up
literature
in
flames
the
christian
fathers
from
tertullian
to
gregory
the
great
i
regret
to
say
either
heartily
assisting
or
at
least
warming
their
benedictory
hands
at
the
blaze
and
so
thoroughly
they
do
their
work
that
even
the
writings
of
aristotle
the
philosopher
must
wait
for
centuries
as
silently
gone
out
of
mind
or
things
violently
destroyed
to
borrow
wordsworth
fine
phrase
and
creep
back
into
europe
bit
by
bit
under
cover
of
arabic
translations
the
scholars
set
to
work
and
begin
rebuilding
patient
indefatigable
anonymous
as
the
coral
insects
at
work
on
a
pacific
building
until
on
the
near
side
of
the
gulf
we
call
the
dark
age
islets
of
scholarship
lift
themselves
above
the
waters
mere
specks
at
first
but
ridges
appear
and
connect
them
and
to
first
seeming
sterile
enough
nec
cereri
opportuna
seges
nec

baccho
but
as
they
join
and
become
a
firma
a
thin
soil
gathers
on
them
god
knows
whence
and
god
knows
whence
the
seed
is
brought
may
chance
of
wheat
or
of
some
other
grain
there
is
a
price
again
for
this
resurrection
but
how
nobly
how
blithely
paid
you
may
learn
without
seeking
recondite
examples
from
cuthbert
famous
letter
describing
the
death
of
bede
compare
that
story
with
that
of
the
last
conversation
of
socrates
and
you
will
surely
recognise
that
the
two
men
are
brothers
born
out
of
time
that
bede
work
has
been
a
legacy
that
his
life
has
been
given
to
recreating
not
scholarship
merely
nor
literature
merely
but
through
them
both
something
above
them
both
the
soul
of
europe
and
this
may
or
may
not
lead
you
on
to
reflect
that
beyond
our
present
passions
and
beyond
this
war
in
a
common
sanity
europe
and
america
with
her
will
have
to
discover
that
common
soul
again
but
eminent
spirits
such
as
bede
are
by
their
very
eminence
less
representative
of
the
process
essentially
fugitive
and
than
the
thousands
of
copyists
who
have
left
no
name
behind
them
let
me
read
you
a
short
paragraph
from
the
cambridge
history
of
english
literature
chapter
written
the
other
day
by
one
of
our
own
teachers
the
cloister
was
the
centre
of
life
in
the
monastery
and
in
the
cloister
was
the
workshop
of
the
patient
scribe
it
is
hard
to
realise
that
the
fair
and
seemly
handwriting
of
these
manuscripts
was
executed
by
fingers
which
on
winter
days
when
the
wind
howled
through
the
cloisters
must
have
been
numbed
by
icy
cold
it
is
true
that
occasionally
little
carrels
or
studies
in
the
recesses
of
the
windows
were
screened
off
from
the
main
walk
of
the
cloister
and
sometimes
a
small
room
or
cell
would
be
partitioned
off
for
the
use
of
a
single
scribe
the
room
would
then
be
called
the
scriptorium
but
it
is
unlikely
that
any
save
the
oldest
and
most
learned
of
the
community
were
afforded
this
luxury
in
these
scriptoria
of
various
kinds
the
earliest
annals
and
chronicles
in
the
english
language
were
penned
in
the
beautiful
and
painstaking
forms
in
which
we
know
them
if
you
seek
testimony
here
are
the
of
a
poor
monk
of
wessobrunn
endorsed
upon
his
ms
the
book
which
you
now
see
was
written
in
the
outer
seats
of
the
cloister
while
i
wrote
i
froze
and
what
i
could
not
write
by
the
beams
of
day
i
finished
by
candlelight
we
might
profitably
spend
but
can
not
spare
a
while
upon
the
pains
these
men
of
the
middle
ages
took
to
accumulate
books
and
to
keep
them
the
chained
volumes
in
old
libraries
for
example
might
give
us
a
text
for
this
as
well
as
start
us
speculating
why
it
is
that
to
this
day
the
human
conscience
incurably
declines
to
include
books
with
other
portable
property
covered
by
the
eighth
commandment
or
we
might
follow
several
of
the
early
scholars
and
humanists
in
their
passionate
chasings
across
europe
in
and
out
of
obscure
monasteries
to
recover
the
lost
mss
of
the
classics
might
tell
for
instance
of
pope
nicholas
v
whose
was
tommaso
parentucelli
and
how
he
rescued
the
mss
from
constantinople
and
founded
the
vatican
library
or
of
aurispa
of
sicily
who
collected
two
hundred
and
for
florence
or
the
story
of
the
of
the
greek
text
of
homer
or
we
might
dwell
on
the
awaking
of
our
literature
and
the
trend
given
to
it
by
men
of
the
italian
and
french
renaissance
or
on
the
residence
of
erasmus
here
in
this
university
with
its
results
vii
but
i
have
said
enough
to
make
it
clear
that
as
we
owe
so
much
of
our
best
to
understanding
europe
so
the
need
to
understand
europe
lies
urgently
upon
large
classes
in
this
country
and
that
yet
in
the
nature
of
things
these
classes
can
never
enjoy
such
leisure
as
our
forefathers
enjoyed
to
understand
what
i
call
the
soul
of
europe
or
at
least
to
misunderstand
it
let
me
point
out
further
that
within
the
last
few
months
we
have
doubled
the
difficulty
at
a
stroke
by
sharing
the
government
of
our
country
with
women
and
admitting
them
to
parliament
it
beseems
a
great
nation
to
take
great
risks
to
dare
them
is
at
once
a
sign
and
a
property
of
greatness
and
for
good
or
ill
but
for
limitless
good
as
we
trust
our
country
has
quietly
made
this
enterprise
amid
the
preoccupations
of
the
greatest
war
in
its
annals
look
at
it
as
you
will
let
other
generations
judge
it
as
they
will
it
stands
a
monument
of
our
faith
in
free
that
in
these
most
perilous
days
we
gave
and
took
so
high
a
guerdon
of
trust
in
one
another
but
clearly
it
implies
that
all
the
women
of
this
country
down
to
the
small
girls
entering
our
elementary
schools
must
be
taught
a
great
many
things
their
mothers
and
grandmothers
happy
in
their
generation
were
content
not
to
know
it
can
not
be
denied
i
think
that
in
the
long
course
of
this
war
now
happily
on
the
point
of
a
victorious
conclusion
we
have
suffered
heavily
through
past
neglect
and
present
nescience
of
our
literature
which
is
so
much
more
european
so
much
more
catholic
a
thing
than
either
our
politics
or
our
national
religion
that
largely
by
reason
of
this
neglect
and
this
nescience
our
statesmen
have
again
and
again
failed
to
foresee
how
continental
nations
would
act
through
failing
to
understand
their
minds
and
have
almost
invariably
through
this
lack
of
sympathetic
understanding
failed
to
interpret
us
to
foreign
friend
or
foe
even
when
and
it
was
not
often
they
interpreted
us
to
ourselves
i
note
that
america
a
country
with
no
comparable
separate
tradition
of
literature
has
customarily
chosen
men
distinguished
by
the
grace
of
letters
for
ambassadors
to
the
court
of
st
james
motley
lowell
hay
page
in
our
time
and
has
for
her
president
a
man
of
letters
and
a
professor
at
that
whereas
even
in
these
critical
days
great
britain
having
a
most
noble
cause
and
at
least
writers
and
speakers
capable
of
presenting
it
with
dignity
and
so
clearly
that
no
neutral
nation
could
mistake
its
logic
has
by
preference
entrusted
it
to
stunt
journalists
and
if
in
these
later
days
you
have
lacked
a
voice
to
interpret
you
in
the
great
accent
of
a
chatham
the
cause
lies
in
past
indifference
to
that
literary
tradition
which
is
by
no
means
the
least
among
the
glories
of
our
birth
and
state
viii
masterpieces
then
will
serve
us
as
prophylactics
of
taste
even
from
childhood
and
will
help
us
further
to
interpret
the
common
mind
of
civilisation
but
they
have
a
third
and
yet
nobler
use
they
teach
us
to
lift
our
own
souls
for
witness
to
this
and
to
the
way
of
it
i
am
going
to
call
an
old
writer
for
whom
be
it
whim
or
not
i
have
an
almost
century
reverence
longinus
no
one
exactly
knows
who
he
was
although
it
is
usual
to
identify
him
with
that
longinus
who
philosophised
in
the
court
of
the
queen
zenobia
and
was
by
her
in
her
downfall
handed
over
with
her
other
counsellors
to
be
executed
by
aurelian
though
again
as
is
usual
certain
bold
bad
men
affirm
that
whether
he
was
this
longinus
or
not
the
treatise
of
which
i
speak
was
not
written
by
any
longinus
at
all
but
by
someone
with
a
different
name
with
which
they
are
unacquainted
be
this
as
it
may
somebody
wrote
the
treatise
and
its
first
editor
francis
robertello
of
basle
in
called
him
dionysius
longinus
and
so
shall
i
and
have
done
with
it
careless
that
other
mss
than
that
used
by
robertello
speak
of
dionysius
or
longinus
dionysius
longinus
then
in
the
century
some
say
in
the
it
is
no
great
matter
wrote
a
little
book
greek
peri
upsous
commonly
cited
as
longinus
on
the
sublime
the
title
is
handy
but
quite
misleading
unless
you
remember
that
by
longinus
meant
as
he
expressly
defines
it
certain
distinction
and
excellence
in
speech
the
book
thus
recovered
had
great
authority
with
critics
of
the
and
centuries
for
the
last
hundred
years
it
has
quite
undeservedly
gone
out
of
vogue
it
is
i
admit
a
puzzling
book
though
quite
clear
in
argument
and
language
pellucidly
clear
but
here
and
there
strangely
modern
even
hauntingly
modern
if
the
phrase
may
be
allowed
you
find
yourself
rubbing
your
eyes
over
a
passage
more
like
matthew
arnold
than
something
of
the
century
or
you
come
without
warning
on
a
few
lines
of
criticism
as
we
call
it
an
illustration
from
genesis
said
let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
used
for
a
specimen
of
the
exalted
way
of
saying
things
generally
you
have
a
sense
that
this
lineage
is
mysterious
after
the
fashion
of
melchisedek
well
to
our
point
longinus
finds
that
the
conditions
of
lofty
utterance
are
five
of
which
the
first
is
by
far
the
most
important
and
this
foremost
condition
is
innate
you
either
have
it
or
you
have
not
here
it
is
says
longinus
have
written
as
follows
sublimity
is
the
echo
of
a
great
soul
hence
even
a
bare
idea
sometimes
by
itself
and
without
a
spoken
word
will
excite
admiration
just
because
of
the
greatness
of
soul
implied
thus
the
silence
of
ajax
in
the
underworld
is
great
and
more
sublime
than
words
you
remember
the
passage
how
odysseus
meets
that
great
spirit
among
the
shades
and
would
placate
it
would
up
their
quarrel
on
earth
now
with
carneying
words
son
of
noble
telamon
wilt
thou
not
then
even
in
death
forget
thine
anger
against
me
over
that
cursed
armour
nay
there
is
none
other
to
blame
but
zeus
he
laid
thy
doom
on
thee
nay
come
hither
o
my
lord
and
hear
me
and
master
thine
indignation
so
i
spake
but
he
answered
me
not
a
word
but
strode
from
me
into
the
darkness
following
the
others
of
the
dead
that
be
departed
longinus
goes
on
it
is
by
all
means
necessary
to
point
this
out
that
the
truly
eloquent
must
be
free
from
base
and
ignoble
or
thoughts
for
it
is
not
possible
that
men
who
live
their
lives
with
mean
and
servile
aims
and
ideas
should
produce
what
is
admirable
and
worthy
of
immortality
great
accents
we
expect
to
fall
from
the
lips
of
those
whose
thoughts
are
dignified
believe
this
and
it
surely
follows
as
concave
implies
convex
that
by
daily
converse
and
association
with
these
great
ones
we
take
their
breeding
their
manners
earn
their
magnanimity
make
ours
their
gifts
of
courtesy
unselfishness
mansuetude
high
seated
pride
scorn
of
pettiness
wholesome
plentiful
jovial
laughter
he
that
of
such
a
height
hath
built
his
mind
and
rear
the
dwelling
of
his
soul
so
strong
as
neither
fear
nor
hope
can
shake
the
frame
of
his
resolvèd
powers
nor
all
the
wind
of
vanity
or
malice
pierce
to
wrong
his
settled
peace
or
to
disturb
the
same
what
a
fair
seat
hath
he
from
whence
he
may
the
boundless
wastes
and
wilds
of
man
survey
and
with
how
free
an
eye
doth
he
look
down
upon
these
lower
regions
of
turmoil
where
all
the
storms
of
passions
mainly
beat
on
flesh
and
blood
where
honour
power
renown
are
only
gay
afflictions
golden
toil
where
greatness
stands
upon
as
feeble
feet
as
frailty
doth
and
only
great
doth
seem
to
little
minds
who
do
it
so
esteem
knowing
the
heart
of
man
is
set
to
be
the
centre
of
this
world
about
the
which
these
revolutions
of
disturbances
still
roll
where
all
th
aspects
of
misery
predominate
whose
strong
effects
are
such
as
he
must
bear
being
powerless
to
redress
and
that
unless
above
himself
he
can
erect
himself
how
poor
a
thing
is
man
ix
if
the
exhortation
of
these
verses
be
somewhat
too
high
and
stoical
for
you
let
me
return
to
longinus
and
read
you
from
his
concluding
chapter
a
passage
you
may
find
not
inapposite
to
these
times
nor
without
a
moral
remains
he
says
clear
up
my
dear
terentianus
a
question
which
a
certain
philosopher
has
recently
mooted
i
wonder
he
says
no
doubt
do
many
others
how
it
happens
that
in
our
time
there
are
men
who
have
the
gift
of
persuasion
to
the
utmost
extent
and
are
well
fitted
for
public
life
and
are
keen
and
ready
and
particularly
rich
in
all
the
charms
of
language
yet
there
no
longer
arise
really
lofty
and
transcendent
natures
unless
it
be
quite
peradventure
so
great
and
a
dearth
of
high
utterance
attends
our
age
can
it
be
he
continued
are
to
accept
the
common
cant
that
democracy
is
the
nursing
mother
of
genius
and
that
great
men
of
letters
flourish
and
die
with
it
for
freedom
they
say
has
the
power
to
cherish
and
encourage
magnanimous
minds
and
with
it
is
disseminated
eager
mutual
rivalry
and
the
emulous
thirst
to
excel
moreover
by
the
prizes
open
under
a
popular
government
the
mental
faculties
of
orators
are
perpetually
practised
and
whetted
and
as
it
were
rubbed
bright
so
that
they
shine
free
as
the
state
itself
whereas
he
went
on
seem
to
have
learnt
as
an
that
servitude
is
the
law
of
life
being
all
wrapped
while
our
thoughts
are
yet
young
and
tender
in
observances
and
customs
as
in
swaddling
clothes
bound
without
access
to
that
fairest
and
most
fertile
source
of
man
speech
i
mean
freedom
so
that
we
are
turned
out
in
no
other
guise
than
that
of
servile
flatterers
and
servitude
it
has
been
well
said
though
it
be
even
righteous
is
the
cage
of
the
soul
and
a
public
but
i
answered
him
is
easy
my
good
sir
and
characteristic
of
human
nature
to
gird
at
the
age
in
which
one
lives
yet
consider
whether
it
may
not
be
true
that
it
is
less
the
world
peace
that
ruins
noble
nature
than
this
war
illimitable
which
holds
our
aspirations
in
its
fist
and
occupies
our
age
with
passions
as
with
troops
that
utterly
plunder
and
harry
it
the
love
of
money
and
the
love
of
pleasure
enslave
us
or
rather
as
one
may
say
drown
us
body
and
soul
in
their
depths
for
vast
and
unchecked
wealth
marches
with
lust
of
pleasure
for
comrade
and
when
one
opens
the
gate
of
house
or
city
the
other
at
once
enters
and
abides
and
in
time
these
two
build
nests
in
the
hearts
of
men
and
quickly
rear
a
progeny
only
too
legitimate
and
the
ruin
within
the
man
is
gradually
consummated
as
the
sublimities
of
his
soul
wither
away
and
fade
and
in
ecstatic
contemplation
of
our
mortal
parts
we
omit
to
exalt
and
come
to
neglect
in
nonchalance
that
within
us
which
is
immortal
i
had
a
friend
once
who
being
in
doubt
with
what
picture
to
decorate
the
in
his
library
cast
away
choice
and
wrote
up
two
greek
words

that
is

hospital

footnote
my
education
is
at
last
finished
indeed
it
would
be
strange
if
after
five
years
hard
application
anything
were
left
incomplete
happily
that
is
all
over
now
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
exercise
my
various
accomplishments
me
see
as
to
french
i
am
mistress
of
that
and
speak
it
if
possible
with
more
fluency
than
english
italian
i
can
read
with
ease
and
pronounce
very
well
as
well
at
least
and
better
than
any
of
my
friends
and
that
is
all
one
need
wish
for
in
italian
music
i
have
learned
till
i
am
perfectly
sick
of
it
but
it
will
be
delightful
to
play
when
we
have
company
i
must
still
continue
to
practise
a
little
the
only
thing
i
think
that
i
need
now
to
improve
myself
in
and
then
there
are
my
italian
songs
which
everybody
allows
i
sing
with
taste
and
as
it
is
what
so
few
people
can
pretend
to
i
am
particularly
glad
that
i
can
drawings
are
universally
admired
especially
the
shells
and
flowers
which
are
beautiful
certainly
besides
this
i
have
a
decided
taste
in
all
kinds
of
fancy
ornaments
then
my
dancing
and
waltzing
in
which
our
master
himself
owned
that
he
could
take
me
no
further
just
the
figure
for
it
certainly
it
would
be
unpardonable
if
i
did
not
excel
to
common
things
geography
and
history
and
poetry
and
philosophy
thank
my
stars
i
have
got
through
them
all
so
that
i
may
consider
myself
not
only
perfectly
accomplished
but
also
thoroughly
to
be
sure
how
much
have
i
fagged
through
the
only
wonder
is
that
one

it
