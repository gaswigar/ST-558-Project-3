copyright

co
for
stephanie
from
cousin
b
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
frog
called
jeremy
fisher
he
lived
in
a
little
damp
house
amongst
the
buttercups
at
the
edge
of
a
pond
the
water
was
all
in
the
larder
and
in
the
back
passage
but
jeremy
liked
getting
his
feet
wet
nobody
ever
scolded
him
and
he
never
caught
a
cold
he
was
quite
pleased
when
he
looked
out
and
saw
large
drops
of
rain
splashing
in
the
pond
i
will
get
some
worms
and
go
fishing
and
catch
a
dish
of
minnows
for
my
dinner
said
jeremy
fisher
if
i
catch
more
than
five
fish
i
will
invite
my
friends
alderman
ptolemy
tortoise
and
sir
isaac
newton
the
alderman
however
eats
salad
jeremy
put
on
a
macintosh
and
a
pair
of
shiny
goloshes
he
took
his
rod
and
basket
and
set
off
with
enormous
hops
to
the
place
where
he
kept
his
boat
the
boat
was
round
and
green
and
very
like
the
other
it
was
tied
to
a
in
the
middle
of
the
pond
jeremy
took
a
reed
pole
and
pushed
the
boat
out
into
open
water
i
know
a
good
place
for
minnows
said
jeremy
fisher
jeremy
stuck
his
pole
into
the
mud
and
fastened
the
boat
to
it
then
he
settled
himself
and
arranged
his
fishing
tackle
he
had
the
dearest
little
red
float
his
rod
was
a
tough
stalk
of
grass
his
line
was
a
fine
long
white
and
he
tied
a
little
wriggling
worm
at
the
end
the
rain
trickled
down
his
back
and
for
nearly
an
hour
he
stared
at
the
float
this
is
getting
tiresome
i
think
i
should
like
some
lunch
said
jeremy
fisher
he
punted
back
again
amongst
the
and
took
some
lunch
out
of
his
basket
i
will
eat
a
butterfly
sandwich
and
wait
till
the
shower
is
over
said
jeremy
fisher
a
great
big
came
up
underneath
the
lily
leaf
and
tweaked
the
toe
of
one
of
his
goloshes
jeremy
crossed
his
legs
up
shorter
out
of
reach
and
went
on
eating
his
sandwich
once
or
twice
something
moved
about
with
a
rustle
and
a
splash
amongst
the
rushes
at
the
side
of
the
pond
i
trust
that
is
not
a
rat
said
jeremy
fisher
i
think
i
had
better
get
away
from
here
jeremy
shoved
the
boat
out
again
a
little
way
and
dropped
in
the
bait
there
was
a
bite
almost
directly
the
float
gave
a
tremendous
bobbit
a
minnow
a
minnow
i
have
him
by
the
nose
cried
jeremy
fisher
jerking
up
his
rod
but
what
a
horrible
surprise
instead
of
a
smooth
fat
minnow
jeremy
landed
little
jack
sharp
the
stickleback
covered
with
spines
the
stickleback
floundered
about
the
boat
pricking
and
snapping
until
he
was
quite
out
of
breath
then
he
jumped
back
into
the
water
and
a
shoal
of
other
little
fishes
put
their
heads
out
and
laughed
at
jeremy
fisher
and
while
jeremy
sat
disconsolately
on
the
edge
of
his
boat
sucking
his
sore
fingers
and
peering
down
into
the
water
a
worse
thing
happened
a
really
thing
it
would
have
been
if
jeremy
had
not
been
wearing
a
macintosh
a
great
big
enormous
trout
came
up
with
a
splash
and
it
seized
jeremy
with
a
snap
ow
ow
ow
and
then
it
turned
and
dived
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
pond
but
the
trout
was
so
displeased
with
the
taste
of
the
macintosh
that
in
less
than
half
a
minute
it
spat
him
out
again
and
the
only
thing
it
swallowed
was
jeremy
goloshes
jeremy
bounced
up
to
the
surface
of
the
water
like
a
cork
and
the
bubbles
out
of
a
soda
water
bottle
and
he
swam
with
all
his
might
to
the
edge
of
the
pond
he
scrambled
out
on
the
first
bank
he
came
to
and
he
hopped
home
across
the
meadow
with
his
macintosh
all
in
tatters
what
a
mercy
that
was
not
a
pike
said
jeremy
fisher
i
have
lost
my
rod
and
basket
but
it
does
not
much
matter
for
i
am
sure
i
should
never
have
dared
to
go
fishing
again
he
put
some
sticking
plaster
on
his
fingers
and
his
friends
both
came
to
dinner
he
could
not
offer
them
fish
but
he
had
something
else
in
his
larder
sir
isaac
newton
wore
his
black
and
gold
waistcoat
and
alderman
ptolemy
tortoise
brought
a
salad
with
him
in
a
string
bag
and
instead
of
a
nice
dish
of
minnows
they
had
a
roasted
grasshopper
with
sauce
which
frogs
consider
a
beautiful
treat
but
think
it
must
have
been
nasty
the
end
