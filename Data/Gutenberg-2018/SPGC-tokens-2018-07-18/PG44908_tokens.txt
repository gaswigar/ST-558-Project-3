preface
in
offering
to
the
public
a
second
edition
of
law
of
civilization
and
i
take
the
opportunity
to
say
emphatically
that
such
value
as
the
essay
may
have
lies
in
its
freedom
from
any
preconceived
bias
all
theories
contained
in
the
book
whether
religious
or
economic
are
the
effect
and
not
the
cause
of
the
way
in
which
the
facts
unfolded
themselves
i
have
been
passive
the
value
of
history
lies
not
in
the
multitude
of
facts
collected
but
in
their
relation
to
each
other
and
in
this
respect
an
author
can
have
no
larger
responsibility
than
any
other
scientific
observer
if
the
sequence
of
events
seems
to
indicate
the
existence
of
a
law
governing
social
development
such
a
law
may
be
suggested
but
to
approve
or
disapprove
of
it
would
be
as
futile
as
to
discuss
the
moral
bearings
of
gravitation
some
years
ago
when
writing
a
sketch
of
the
history
of
the
colony
of
massachusetts
bay
i
became
deeply
interested
in
certain
religious
aspects
of
the
reformation
which
seemed
hardly
reconcilable
with
the
theories
usually
advanced
to
explain
them
after
the
book
had
been
published
i
continued
reading
theology
and
step
by
step
was
led
back
through
the
schoolmen
and
the
crusades
to
the
revival
of
the
pilgrimage
to
palestine
which
followed
upon
the
conversion
of
the
huns
as
ferocious
pagans
the
huns
had
long
closed
the
road
to
constantinople
but
the
change
which
swept
over
europe
after
the
year
when
saint
stephen
was
crowned
was
unmistakable
the
west
received
an
impulsion
from
the
east
i
thus
became
convinced
that
religious
enthusiasm
which
by
stimulating
the
pilgrimage
restored
communication
between
the
bosphorus
and
the
rhine
was
the
power
which
produced
the
accelerated
movement
culminating
in
modern
centralization
meanwhile
i
thought
i
had
discovered
not
only
that
faith
during
the
eleventh
twelfth
and
early
thirteenth
centuries
spoke
by
preference
through
architecture
but
also
that
in
france
and
syria
at
least
a
precise
relation
existed
between
the
ecclesiastical
and
military
systems
of
building
and
that
the
one
could
not
be
understood
without
the
other
in
the
commercial
cities
of
the
same
epoch
on
the
contrary
the
religious
idea
assumed
no
definite
form
of
artistic
expression
for
the
gothic
never
flourished
in
venice
genoa
pisa
or
florence
nor
did
any
pure
school
of
architecture
thrive
in
the
mercantile
atmosphere
furthermore
commerce
from
the
outset
seemed
antagonistic
to
the
imagination
for
a
universal
decay
of
architecture
set
in
throughout
europe
after
the
great
commercial
expansion
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
the
inference
i
drew
from
these
facts
was
that
the
economic
instinct
must
have
chosen
some
other
medium
by
which
to
express
itself
my
observations
led
me
to
suppose
that
the
coinage
might
be
such
a
medium
and
i
ultimately
concluded
that
if
the
development
of
a
mercantile
community
is
to
be
understood
it
must
be
approached
through
its
money
another
conviction
forced
upon
my
mind
by
the
examination
of
long
periods
of
history
was
the
exceedingly
small
part
played
by
conscious
thought
in
moulding
the
fate
of
men
at
the
moment
of
action
the
human
being
almost
invariably
obeys
an
instinct
like
an
animal
only
after
action
has
ceased
does
he
reflect
these
controlling
instincts
are
involuntary
and
divide
men
into
species
distinct
enough
to
cause
opposite
effects
under
identical
conditions
for
instance
impelled
by
fear
one
type
will
rush
upon
an
enemy
and
another
will
run
away
while
the
love
of
women
or
of
money
has
stamped
certain
races
as
sharply
as
ferocity
or
cunning
has
stamped
the
lion
or
the
fox
like
other
personal
characteristics
the
peculiarities
of
the
mind
are
apparently
strongly
hereditary
and
if
these
instincts
be
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
it
is
plain
that
as
the
external
world
changes
those
who
receive
this
heritage
must
rise
or
fall
in
the
social
scale
according
as
their
nervous
system
is
well
or
ill
adapted
to
the
conditions
to
which
they
are
born
nothing
is
commoner
for
example
than
to
find
families
who
have
been
famous
in
one
century
sinking
into
obscurity
in
the
next
not
because
the
children
have
degenerated
but
because
a
certain
field
of
activity
which
afforded
the
ancestor
full
scope
has
been
closed
against
his
offspring
particularly
has
this
been
true
in
revolutionary
epochs
such
as
the
reformation
and
families
so
situated
have
very
generally
become
extinct
when
this
stage
had
been
reached
the
reformation
began
to
wear
a
new
aspect
but
several
years
elapsed
before
i
saw
whither
my
studies
led
only
very
slowly
did
a
sequence
of
cause
and
effect
take
shape
in
my
mind
a
sequence
wholly
unexpected
in
character
whose
growth
resembled
the
arrangement
of
the
fragments
of
an
inscription
which
can
not
be
read
until
the
stones
have
been
set
in
a
determined
order
finally
as
the
historical
work
neared
an
end
i
perceived
that
the
intellectual
phenomena
under
examination
fell
into
a
series
which
seemed
to
correspond
somewhat
closely
with
the
laws
which
are
supposed
to
regulate
the
movements
of
the
material
universe
theories
can
be
tested
only
by
applying
them
to
facts
and
the
facts
relating
to
successive
phases
of
human
thought
whether
conscious
or
unconscious
constitute
history
therefore
if
intellectual
phenomena
are
evolved
in
a
regular
sequence
history
like
matter
must
be
governed
by
law
in
support
of
such
a
conjecture
i
venture
to
offer
an
hypothesis
by
which
to
classify
a
few
of
the
more
interesting
intellectual
phases
through
which
human
society
must
apparently
pass
in
its
oscillations
between
barbarism
and
civilization
or
what
amounts
to
the
same
thing
in
its
movement
from
a
condition
of
physical
dispersion
to
one
of
concentration
the
accompanying
volume
contains
the
evidence
which
suggested
the
hypothesis
although
it
seems
hardly
necessary
to
add
an
essay
of
this
size
on
so
vast
a
subject
can
only
be
regarded
as
a
suggestion
the
theory
proposed
is
based
upon
the
accepted
scientific
principle
that
the
law
of
force
and
energy
is
of
universal
application
in
nature
and
that
animal
life
is
one
of
the
outlets
through
which
solar
energy
is
dissipated
starting
from
this
fundamental
proposition
the
first
deduction
is
that
as
human
societies
are
forms
of
animal
life
these
societies
must
differ
among
themselves
in
energy
in
proportion
as
nature
has
endowed
them
more
or
less
abundantly
with
energetic
material
thought
is
one
of
the
manifestations
of
human
energy
and
among
the
earlier
and
simpler
phases
of
thought
two
stand
conspicuous
fear
and
greed
fear
which
by
stimulating
the
imagination
creates
a
belief
in
an
invisible
world
and
ultimately
develops
a
priesthood
and
greed
which
dissipates
energy
in
war
and
trade
probably
the
velocity
of
the
social
movement
of
any
community
is
proportionate
to
its
energy
and
mass
and
its
centralization
is
proportionate
to
its
velocity
therefore
as
human
movement
is
accelerated
societies
centralize
in
the
earlier
stages
of
concentration
fear
appears
to
be
the
channel
through
which
energy
finds
the
readiest
outlet
accordingly
in
primitive
and
scattered
communities
the
imagination
is
vivid
and
the
mental
types
produced
are
religious
military
artistic
as
consolidation
advances
fear
yields
to
greed
and
the
economic
organism
tends
to
supersede
the
emotional
and
martial
whenever
a
race
is
so
richly
endowed
with
the
energetic
material
that
it
does
not
expend
all
its
energy
in
the
daily
struggle
for
life
the
surplus
may
be
stored
in
the
shape
of
wealth
and
this
stock
of
stored
energy
may
be
transferred
from
community
to
community
either
by
conquest
or
by
superiority
in
economic
competition
however
large
may
be
the
store
of
energy
accumulated
by
conquest
a
race
must
sooner
or
later
reach
the
limit
of
its
martial
energy
when
it
must
enter
on
the
phase
of
economic
competition
but
as
the
economic
organism
radically
differs
from
the
emotional
and
martial
the
effect
of
economic
competition
has
been
perhaps
invariably
to
dissipate
the
energy
amassed
by
war
when
surplus
energy
has
accumulated
in
such
bulk
as
to
preponderate
over
productive
energy
it
becomes
the
controlling
social
force
thenceforward
capital
is
autocratic
and
energy
vents
itself
through
those
organisms
best
fitted
to
give
expression
to
the
power
of
capital
in
this
last
stage
of
consolidation
the
economic
and
perhaps
the
scientific
intellect
is
propagated
while
the
imagination
fades
and
the
emotional
the
martial
and
the
artistic
types
of
manhood
decay
when
a
social
velocity
has
been
attained
at
which
the
waste
of
energetic
material
is
so
great
that
the
martial
and
imaginative
stocks
fail
to
reproduce
themselves
intensifying
competition
appears
to
generate
two
extreme
economic
types
the
usurer
in
his
most
formidable
aspect
and
the
peasant
whose
nervous
system
is
best
adapted
to
thrive
on
scanty
nutriment
at
length
a
point
must
be
reached
when
pressure
can
go
no
further
and
then
perhaps
one
of
two
results
may
follow
a
stationary
period
may
supervene
which
may
last
until
ended
by
war
by
exhaustion
or
by
both
combined
as
seems
to
have
been
the
case
with
the
eastern
empire
or
as
in
the
western
disintegration
may
set
in
the
civilized
population
may
perish
and
a
reversion
may
take
place
to
a
primitive
form
of
organism
the
evidence
however
seems
to
point
to
the
conclusion
that
when
a
highly
centralized
society
disintegrates
under
the
pressure
of
economic
competition
it
is
because
the
energy
of
the
race
has
been
exhausted
consequently
the
survivors
of
such
a
community
lack
the
power
necessary
for
renewed
concentration
and
must
probably
remain
inert
until
supplied
with
fresh
energetic
material
by
the
infusion
of
barbarian
blood

civilization

chapter
i
the
romans
when
the
romans
first
emerged
from
the
mist
of
fable
they
were
already
a
race
of
who
held
their
property
in
severalty
and
as
the
right
of
alienation
was
established
the
formation
of
relatively
large
estates
had
begun
the
ordinary
family
however
held
perhaps
twelve
acres
and
as
the
land
was
arable
and
the
staple
grain
it
supported
a
dense
rural
population
the
husbandmen
who
tilled
this
land
were
of
the
martial
type
and
probably
for
that
reason
though
supremely
gifted
as
administrators
and
soldiers
were
to
endure
the
strain
of
the
unrestricted
economic
competition
of
a
centralized
society
consequently
their
conquests
had
hardly
consolidated
before
decay
set
in
a
decay
whose
causes
may
be
traced
back
until
they
are
lost
in
the
dawn
of
history
the
latins
had
little
economic
versatility
they
lacked
the
instinct
of
the
greeks
for
commerce
or
of
the
syrians
and
hindoos
for
manufactures
they
were
essentially
and
when
endowed
with
the
acquisitive
faculty
usurers
the
latter
early
developed
into
a
distinct
species
at
once
more
subtle
of
intellect
and
more
tenacious
of
life
than
the
farmers
and
on
the
disparity
between
these
two
types
of
men
the
fate
of
all
subsequent
civilization
has
hinged
at
a
remote
antiquity
roman
society
divided
into
creditors
and
debtors
as
it
consolidated
the
power
of
the
former
increased
thus
intensifying
the
pressure
on
the
weak
until
when
centralization
culminated
under
the
cæsars
reproduction
slackened
disintegration
set
in
and
after
some
centuries
of
decline
the
middle
ages
began
the
history
of
the
monarchy
must
probably
always
remain
a
matter
of
conjecture
but
it
seems
reasonably
certain
that
the
expulsion
of
the
tarquins
was
the
victory
of
an
hereditary
monied
caste
which
succeeded
in
concentrating
the
functions
of
government
in
a
practically
body
drawn
from
their
own
order
niebuhr
has
demonstrated
in
one
of
his
most
striking
chapters
that
usury
was
originally
a
patrician
privilege
and
some
of
the
fiercest
struggles
of
the
early
republic
seem
to
have
been
decided
against
the
oligarchy
by
wealthy
plebeians
who
were
determined
to
break
down
the
monopoly
in
at
all
events
the
conditions
of
life
evidently
favoured
the
growth
of
the
instinct
which
causes
its
possessor
to
suck
the
vitality
of
the
economically
weak
and
macaulay
in
the
preface
to
has
given
so
vivid
a
picture
of
the
dominant
class
that
one
passage
at
least
should
be
read
entire
the
ruling
class
in
rome
was
a
monied
class
and
it
made
and
administered
the
laws
with
a
view
solely
to
its
own
interest
thus
the
relation
between
lender
and
borrower
was
mixed
up
with
the
relation
between
sovereign
and
subject
the
great
men
held
a
large
portion
of
the
community
in
dependence
by
means
of
advances
at
enormous
usury
the
law
of
debt
framed
by
creditors
and
for
the
protection
of
creditors
was
the
most
horrible
that
has
ever
been
known
among
men
the
liberty
and
even
the
life
of
the
insolvent
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
patrician
children
often
became
slaves
in
consequence
of
the
misfortunes
of
their
parents
the
debtor
was
imprisoned
not
in
a
public
gaol
under
the
care
of
impartial
public
functionaries
but
in
a
private
workhouse
belonging
to
the
creditor
frightful
stories
were
told
respecting
these
but
a
prisoner
is
an
expense
and
the
patricians
wanted
money
their
problem
was
to
exhaust
the
productive
power
of
the
debtor
before
selling
him
and
as
slaves
have
less
energy
than
freemen
a
system
was
devised
by
which
the
plebeians
were
left
on
their
land
and
stimulated
to
labour
by
the
hope
of
redeeming
themselves
and
their
children
from
servitude
niebuhr
has
explained
at
length
how
this
was
done
for
money
weighed
out
a
person
could
pledge
himself
his
family
and
all
that
belonged
to
him
in
this
condition
he
became
and
remained
in
possession
of
his
property
until
breach
of
condition
when
the
creditor
could
proceed
by
summary
process
such
a
contract
satisfied
the
requirements
and
the
usurers
had
then
only
to
invent
a
judgment
for
debt
severe
enough
to
force
the
debtor
to
become
when
the
alternative
was
offered
him
this
presented
no
difficulty
when
an
action
was
begun
the
defendant
had
thirty
days
of
grace
and
was
then
arrested
and
brought
before
the
prætor
if
he
could
neither
pay
nor
find
security
he
was
fettered
with
irons
weighing
not
less
than
fifteen
pounds
and
taken
home
by
the
plaintiff
there
he
was
allowed
a
pound
of
corn
a
day
and
given
sixty
days
in
which
to
settle
if
he
failed
he
was
taken
again
before
the
prætor
and
sentenced
under
this
sentence
he
might
be
sold
or
executed
and
where
there
were
several
plaintiffs
they
might
cut
him
up
among
them
nor
was
any
individual
liable
for
carving
more
than
his
share
a
man
so
sentenced
involved
his
descendants
and
therefore
rather
than
submit
the
whole
debtor
class
became
toiling
for
ever
to
fulfil
contracts
quite
beyond
their
strength
and
year
by
year
sinking
more
hopelessly
into
debt
for
ordinarily
the
accumulated
interest
soon
raised
the
principal
to
many
times
its
original
niebuhr
has
thus
summed
up
the
economic
situation
to
understand
the
condition
of
the
plebeian
debtors
let
the
reader
if
he
is
a
man
of
business
imagine
that
the
whole
of
the
private
debts
in
a
given
country
were
turned
into
bills
at
a
year
bearing
interest
at
twenty
per
cent
or
more
and
that
the
of
them
were
followed
on
summary
process
by
imprisonment
and
by
the
transfer
of
the
debtor
s
whole
property
to
his
creditor
even
though
it
exceeded
what
he
owed
we
do
not
need
those
further
circumstances
which
are
incompatible
with
our
manners
the
personal
slavery
of
the
debtor
and
of
his
children
to
form
an
estimate
of
the
fearful
condition
of
the
unfortunate
thus
the
usurer
first
exhausted
a
family
and
then
sold
it
and
as
his
class

and

the
laws
were
as
ingeniously
contrived
for
creating
debt
as
for
making
it
profitable
when
contracted
one
characteristic
device
was
the
power
given
the
magistrate
of
fining
for
offences
against
under

include
any
accusations
they
pleased

by

in
the
scale
of

they
might
accomplish
whatever
they
as
the
capitalists
owned
the

and
administered
justice
they
had
the
means
at
hand
of
ruining
any
plebeian
whose

was
tempting
nevertheless
the
stronghold
of
usury
lay
in
the
fiscal
system
which
down
to
the
fall
of
the
empire
was
an
engine
for
working
bankruptcy
rome
s
policy
was
to
farm
the
taxes
that
is
to
say
after
assessment
to
sell
them
to
a
publican
who
collected
what
he
could
the
business
was
profitable
in
proportion
as
it
was
extortionate
and
the
country
was
subjected
to
a
levy
unregulated
by
law
and
conducted
to
enrich
speculators

usury
was
the
cream
of
this
business
the
custom
was
to
lend
to
defaulters
at
such
high
rates
of
interest
that
insolvency
was
nearly
certain
to
follow
then
the

were
stripped
bare
by
the

the
effect
upon
the
latin
society
of
the
fifth
century
before
christ
was
singularly
destructive
italy
was
filled
with
petty
states
in
chronic
war
the
troops
were
an
unpaid
militia
which
comprised
the
whole
population
and
though
the
farms
yielded
enough
for
the
family
in
good
times
when
the
males
were
with
the
legions
labour
was
certain
to
be
lacking
the
campaigns
therefore
brought
want
and
with
want
came
the
inability
to
pay
taxes
as
late
as
the
tunic
war
regulus
asked
to
be
relieved
from
his
command
because
the
death
of
his
slave
and
the
incompetence
of
his
hired
man
left
his
fields
uncared
for
and
if
a
general
and
a
consul
were
pinched
by
absence
the
case
of
the
men
in
the
ranks
can
be
imagined
even
in
victory
the
lot
of
the
common
soldier
was
hard
enough
for
beside
the
chance
of
wounds
and
disease
there
was
the
certain
loss
of
time
for
which
no
compensation
was
made
though
the
plebeians
formed
the
whole
infantry
of
the
line
they
received
no
part
of
the
conquered
lands
and
even
the
plunder
was
taken
from
them
and
appropriated
by
the
patricians
to
their
private
use

the
open

niebuhr
has
pointed
out
that
the
ravaging
of
the
enemy
and
the
new
taxes
laid
to
rebuild
the
ruined
public
works
led
to
general
insolvency
such
conditions
fostered
the
rapid
propagation
of
distinct
types
of
mind
and
at
a
very
early
period
romans
had
been
bred
destitute
of
the
martial
instinct
but
more
crafty
and
more
tenacious
of
life
than
the
soldier
these
were
the
men
who
conceived
and
enforced
the
usury
laws
and
who
held
to
personal
pledges
as
the
dearest
privilege
of
their
order
nor
does
livy
attempt
to
disguise
the
fact
that
every
patrician
house
was
a
gaol
for
debtors
and
that
in
seasons
of
great
distress
after
every
sitting
of
the
courts
herds
of
sentenced
slaves
were
led
away
in
chains
to
the
houses
of
the
of
this
redoubtable
type
the
claudian
family
was
a
famous
specimen
and
the
picture
which
has
been
drawn
by
macaulay
of
the
great
usurer
appius
claudius
the
decemvir
is
so
brilliant
that
it
can
not
be
omitted
appius
claudius
crassus
was
descended
from
a
long
line
of
ancestors
distinguished
by
their
haughty
demeanour
and
by
the
inflexibility
with
which
they
had
withstood
all
the
demands
of
the
plebeian
order
while
the
political
conduct
and
the
deportment
of
the
claudian
nobles
drew
upon
them
the
fiercest
public
hatred
they
were
accused
of
wanting
if
any
credit
is
due
to
the
early
history
of
rome
a
class
of
qualities
which
in
a
military
commonwealth
is
sufficient
to
cover
a
multitude
of
offences
the
chiefs
of
the
family
appear
to
have
been
eloquent
versed
in
civil
business
and
learned
after
the
fashion
of
their
age
but
in
war
they
were
not
distinguished
by
skill
or
valour
some
of
them
as
if
conscious
where
their
weakness
lay
had
when
filling
the
highest
magistracies
taken
internal
administration
as
their
department
of
public
business
and
left
the
military
command
to
their
colleagues
one
of
them
had
been
entrusted
with
an
army
and
had
failed
ignominiously
none
of
them
had
been
honoured
with
a
triumph
his
grandfather
called
like
himself
appius
claudius
had
left
a
name
as
much
detested
as
that
of
sextus
tarquinius
this
elder
appius
had
been
consul
more
than
seventy
years
before
the
introduction
of
the
licinian
laws
by
availing
himself
of
a
singular
crisis
in
public
feeling
he
had
obtained
the
consent
of
the
commons
to
the
abolition
of
the
tribuneship
and
had
been
the
chief
of
that
council
of
ten
to
which
the
whole
direction
of
the
state
had
been
committed
in
a
few
months
his
administration
had
become
universally
odious
it
had
been
swept
away
by
an
irresistible
outbreak
of
popular
fury
and
its
memory
was
still
held
in
abhorrence
by
the
whole
city
the
immediate
cause
of
the
downfall
of
this
execrable
government
was
said
to
have
been
an
attempt
made
by
appius
claudius
upon
the
chastity
of
a
beautiful
young
girl
of
humble
birth
the
story
ran
that
the
decemvir
unable
to
succeed
by
bribes
and
solicitations
resorted
to
an
outrageous
act
of
tyranny
a
vile
dependant
of
the
claudian
house
laid
claim
to
the
damsel
as
his
slave
the
cause
was
brought
before
the
tribunal
of
appius
the
wicked
magistrate
in
defiance
of
the
clearest
proofs
gave
judgment
for
the
claimant
but
the
girl
s
father
a
brave
soldier
saved
her
from
servitude
and
dishonour
by
stabbing
her
to
the
heart
in
the
sight
of
the
whole
forum
that
blow
was
the
signal
for
a
general
explosion
camp
and
city
rose
at
once
the
ten
were
pulled
down
the
tribuneship
was
and
appius
escaped
the
hands
of
the
executioner
only
by
a
voluntary
virginia
was
slain
in
just
in
the
midst
of
the
long
convulsion
which
began
with
the
secession
to
the
mons
sacer
and
ended
with
the
licinian
laws
during
this
century
and
a
quarter
usury
drained
the
roman
vitality
low
niebuhr
was
doubtless
right
in
his
conjecture
that
the
mutinous
legions
were
filled
with
nexi
to
whom
the
continuance
of
the
existing
status
meant
slavery
and
mommsen
also
pointed
out
that
the
convulsions
of
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
in
which
it
seemed
as
though
roman
society
must
disintegrate
were
caused
by
the
insolvency
of
the
middle
class
of
had
italy
been
more
tranquil
it
is
not
inconceivable
that
the
small
farmers
might
even
then
have
sunk
into
the
serfdom
which
awaited
them
under
the
empire
for
in
peace
the
patricians
might
have
been
able
to
repress
insurrection
with
their
clients
but
the
accumulation
of
capital
had
hardly
begun
and
several
centuries
were
to
elapse
before
money
was
to
take
its
ultimate
form
in
a
standing
army
meanwhile
troops
were
needed
almost
every
year
to
defend
the
city
and
as
the
legions
were
a
militia
they
were
the
enemy
and
not
the
instrument
of
wealth
until
the
organization
of
a
permanent
paid
police
they
were
however
the
highest
expression
of
force
and
when
opposed
to
them
the
monied
oligarchy
was
helpless
as
was
proved
by
the
secession
to
the
mons
sacer
the
storm
gathered
slowly
the
rural
population
was
ground
down
under
the
usury
laws
and
in
the
farmers
refused
to
respond
to
the
levy
the
consul
publius
servilius
had
to
suspend
prosecutions
for
debt
and
to
liberate
debtors
in
prison
but
at
the
end
of
the
campaign
the
promises
he
had
made
in
the
moment
of
danger
were
repudiated
by
appius
claudius
who
rigorously
enforced
the
usury
legislation
and
who
was
for
the
time
too
strong
to
be
opposed
that
year
the
men
submitted
but
the
next
the
legions
had
again
to
be
embodied
they
again
returned
victorious
their
demands
were
again
rejected
and
then
instead
of
disbanding
they
marched
in
martial
array
into
the
district
of
crustumeria
and
occupied
the
hill
which
ever
after
was
called
the
sacred
mount
resistance
was
not
even
attempted
and
precisely
the
same
surrender
was
repeated
in
when
virginius
stabbed
his
daughter
he
fled
to
the
camp
and
his
comrades
seized
the
standards
and
marched
for
rome
the
senate
yielded
at
once
decreed
the
abolition
of
the
decemvirate
and
the
triumphant
cohorts
drawn
up
upon
the
aventine
chose
their
tribunes
finally
in
the
last
great
struggle
when
camillus
was
made
dictator
to
coerce
the
people
he
found
himself
impotent
the
monied
oligarchy
collapsed
when
confronted
with
an
armed
force
and
camillus
reduced
to
act
as
mediator
vowed
a
temple
to
concord
on
the
passage
of
the
licinian
laws
the
licinian
laws
provided
for
a
partial
liquidation
and
also
for
an
increase
of
the
means
of
the
debtor
class
by
redistribution
of
the
public
land
this
land
had
been
seized
in
war
and
had
been
monopolized
by
the
patricians
without
any
particular
legal
right
licinius
obtained
a
statute
by
which
back
payments
of
interest
should
be
applied
to
extinguishing
the
principal
of
debts
and
balances
then
remaining
due
should
be
liquidated
in
three
annual
instalments
he
also
limited
the
quantity
of
the
public
domain
which
could
be
held
by
any
individual
and
directed
that
the
residue
which
remained
after
the
reduction
of
all
estates
to
that
standard
should
be
distributed
in
lots
pyrrhus
saw
with
a
soldier
s
eye
that
rome
s
strength
did
not
lie
in
her
generals
who
were
frequently
his
inferiors
but
in
her
farmers
whom
he
could
not
crush
by
defeat
and
this
was
the
class
which
was
favoured
by
the
licinian
laws
they
multiplied
greatly
when
the
usurers
capitulated
and
as
macaulay
remarked
the
effect
of
the
reform
was
singularly
happy
and
it
was
indeed
no
less
than
the
conquest
of
italy
rome
while
the
disabilities
of
the
plebeians
continued
was
scarcely
able
to
maintain
her
ground
against
the
volscians
and
hernicans
when
those
disabilities
were
removed
she
rapidly
became
more
than
a
match
for
carthage
and
but
nature
s
very
bounty
to
the
roman
husbandman
and
soldier
proved
his
ruin
patient
of
suffering
enduring
of
fatigue
wise
in
council
fierce
in
war
he
routed
all
who
opposed
him
and
yet
the
vigorous
mind
and
the
robust
frame
which
made
him
victorious
in
battle
were
his
weakness
when
at
peace
he
needed
costly
nutriment
and
when
brought
into
free
economic
competition
with
africans
and
asiatics
he
starved
such
competition
resulted
directly
from
foreign
conquests
and
came
rapidly
when
italy
had
consolidated
and
the
italians
began
to
extend
their
power
over
other
races
nearly
five
centuries
intervened
between
the
foundation
of
the
city
and
the
defeat
of
pyrrhus
but
within
little
more
than
two
hundred
years
from
the
victory
of
beneventum
rome
was
mistress
of
the
world
indeed
beyond
the
peninsula
there
was
not
much
save
carthage
to
stop
the
march
of
the
legions
after
the
death
of
alexander
in
greece
fell
into
decline
and
by
when
rome
attacked
macedon
she
was
in
decrepitude
the
population
of
asia
minor
syria
and
egypt
was
not
martial
and
had
never
been
able
to
cope
in
battle
with
the
western
races
while
spain
and
gaul
though
inhabited
by
fierce
and
hardy
tribes
lacked
cohesion
and
could
not
withstand
the
onset
of
organized
and
disciplined
troops
distance
therefore
rather
than
hostile
military
force
fixed
the
limit
of
the
ancient
centralization
for
the
romans
were
not
maritime
and
consequently
failed
to
absorb
india
or
discover
america
thus
their
relatively
imperfect
movement
made
the
most
material
difference
between
the
ancient
and
modern
economic
system
by
conquest
the
countries
inhabited
by
races
of
a
low
vitality
and
great
tenacity
of
life
were
opened
both
for
trade
and
slaving
and
their
cheap
labour
exterminated
the
husbandmen
of
italy
particularly
after
the
annexation
of
asia
minor
this
labour
overran
sicily
and
the
cultivation
of
the
cereals
by
the
natives
became
impossible
when
the
island
had
been
parcelled
out
into
great
estates
stocked
by
capitalists
with
eastern
slaves
who
at
rome
undersold
all
competitors
during
the
second
century
the
precious
metals
poured
into
latium
in
a
flood
great
fortunes
were
amassed
and
invested
in
land
and
the
asiatic
provinces
of
the
empire
were
swept
of
their
men
in
order
to
make
these
investments
pay
no
data
remain
by
which
to
estimate
even
approximately
the
size
of
this
involuntary
migration
but
it
must
have
reached
enormous
numbers
for
sixty
thousand
captives
were
the
common
booty
of
a
campaign
and
after
provinces
were
annexed
they
were
depopulated
by
the
publicans
the
best
field
hands
came
from
the
regions
where
poverty
had
always
been
extreme
and
where
for
countless
generations
men
had
been
inured
to
toil
on
scanty
food
districts
like
bithynia
and
syria
where
slaves
could
be
bought
for
little
or
nothing
had
always
been
tilled
by
races
far
more
tenacious
of
life
than
any
europeans
after
lucullus
plundered
pontus
a
slave
brought
only
four
drachmæ
or
perhaps
seventy
cents
on
the
other
hand
competition
grew
sharper
among
the
italians
themselves
as
capital
accumulated
in
the
hands
of
the
strongest
the
poor
grew
poorer
and
pauperism
spread
as
early
as
the
marsian
war
in
lucius
marcius
philippus
estimated
that
there
were
only
two
thousand
wealthy
families
among
the
burgesses
in
about
three
hundred
years
nature
had
culled
a
pure
plutocracy
from
what
had
been
originally
an
essentially
martial
race
the
primitive
roman
was
a
high
order
of
husbandman
who
could
only
when
well
fed
flourish
and
multiply
he
was
adapted
to
that
stage
of
society
when
the
remnants
of
caste
gave
a
certain
fixity
of
tenure
to
the
farmer
and
when
prices
were
maintained
by
the
cost
of
communication
with
foreign
countries
as
the
world
centralized
through
conquest
these
barriers
were
swept
away
economic
competition
became
free
land
tended
to
concentrate
in
fewer
and
fewer
hands
and
this
land
was
worked
by
eastern
slaves
who
reduced
the
wages
of
labour
to
the
lowest
point
at
which
the
human
being
can
survive
the
effect
was
to
split
society
in
halves
the
basis
being
servile
and
the
freemen
being
separated
into
a
series
of
classes
according
to
the
economic
power
of
the
mind
wealth
formed
the
title
to
nobility
of
the
great
oligarchy
which
thus
came
to
constitute
the
core
of
the
empire
at
the
head
stood
the

they
lost

of
the
social
system
every
citizen
had
to
declare
his
fortune
before
a
magistrate
and
his
grade
was
then
assigned
him
poverty
and
wealth
established
the
legal
differences
between
the
first
line
of
demarcation
lay
between
those
who
owned
land
and
those
who
did
not
the
former
were
householders
rooted
in
the
soil
the
latter
were
the
were
equal
in
their
poverty
but
the
were
unequal
in
their
wealth
and
were
consequently
divided
into
five
classes
among
these
categories
all
was
unequal
taxes
military
service
and
political
rights
they
did
not
mix
together
if
one
transports
oneself
to
the
last
century
of
the
republic
one
finds
there
an
aristocracy
as
strongly
consolidated
as
the
ancient
patrician
at
the
summit
came
the
senatorial
order
to
belong
to
it
the
first
condition
was
to
possess
a
great
fortune
the
roman
mind
did
not
understand
that
a
poor
man
could
belong
to
the
aristocracy
or
that
a
rich
man
was
not
part
of
archaic
customs
lingered
late
in
rome
for
the
city
was
not
a
centre
of
commercial
exchanges
and
long
after
the
death
of
alexander
when
greece
passed
its
meridian
the
republic
kept
its
copper
coinage
regulus
farmed
his
field
with
a
single
slave
and
a
hired
servant
and
there
was
in
truth
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
famous
meeting
with
cincinnatus
at
the
plough
although
such
simplicity
astonished
a
contemporary
of
augustus
advancing
centralization
swept
away
these
ancient
customs
a
centralization
whose
march
is
perhaps
as
sharply
marked
by
the
migration
of
vagrants
to
the
cities
as
by
any
single
phenomenon
vagrant
paupers
formed
the
proletariat
for
whose
relief
the
frumentariæ
leges
were
framed
and
yet
though
in
some
form
are
considered
a
necessity
in
modern
times
few
institutions
of
antiquity
have
been
more
severely
criticised
than
those
regulating
charity
from
the
time
of
cato
downward
the
tendency
has
been
to
maintain
that
at
rome
demagogues
fed
the
rabble
at
the
cost
of
the
lives
of
the
probably
the
exact
converse
is
the
truth
the
public
gifts
of
food
appear
to
have
been
the
effect
of
the
ruin
of
agriculture
and
not
its
cause
after
the
italian
husbandmen
had
been
made
insolvent
by
the
competition
of
races
of
lower
vitality
they
flocked
starving
to
the
capital
but
it
was
only
reluctantly
that
the
great
speculators
in
grain
who
controlled
the
senate
admitted
the
necessity
of
granting
state
aid
to
the
class
whom
they
had
destroyed
long
before
the
punic
wars
the
carthaginians
had
farmed
sicily
on
capitalistic
principles
that
is
to
say
they
had
stocked
domains
with
slaves
and
had
traded
on
the
basis
of
large
sales
and
narrow
profits
the
romans
when
they
annexed
the
island
only
carried
out
this
system
to
its
logical
end
having
all
asia
minor
to
draw
upon
for
labour
they
deliberately
starved
and
overworked
their
since
it
was
cheaper
to
buy
others
than
to
lose
command
of
the
market
the
familiar
story
of
the
outbreak
of
the
servile
war
about
shows
how
far
the
contemporaries
of
the
sicilian
speculators
believed
them
capable
of
going
damophilus
an
opulent
sicilian
landlord
being
one
day
implored
by
his
slaves
to
have
pity
on
their
nakedness
and
misery
indignantly
demanded
why
they
went
hungry
and
cold
with
arms
in
their
hands
and
the
country
before
them
then
he
bound
them
to
stakes
and
flayed
them
with
the
lash
the
reduction
of
syracuse
by
marcellus
broke
the
carthaginian
power
in
the
island
and
after
the
fall
of
agrigentum
in
the
pacification
of
the
country
went
on
rapidly
probably
from
the
outset
even
in
the
matter
of
transportation
the
provinces
of
the
mainland
were
at
a
disadvantage
because
of
the
cheapness
of
sea
freights
but
at
all
events
the
opening
of
the
sicilian
grain
trade
had
an
immediate
and
disastrous
effect
on
italy
the
migration
of
vagrants
to
rome
began
forthwith
and
within
seven
years
a
public
distribution
of
wheat
took
place
probably
by
the
advice
of
scipio
nevertheless
the
charity
was
private
and
not
gratuitous
on
the
contrary
a
charge
of
six
sesterces
or
cents
the
bushel
was
made
apparently
near
half
the
market
rate
a
price
pretty
regularly
maintained
on
such
occasions
down
to
the
empire
this
interval
comprehended
the
whole
period
of
the
sicilian
supremacy
in
the
corn
trade
for
in
egypt
was
annexed
by
augustus
the
distress
which
followed
upon
free
trade
with
egypt
finally
broke
down
the
resistance
of
the
rich
to
gratuitous
relief
for
the
poor
previously
the
opposition
to
state
aid
had
been
so
stubborn
that
until
no
legal
provision
whatever
was
made
for
paupers
and
yet
the
account
left
by
polybius
of
the
condition
of
lombardy
toward
the
middle
of
the
second
century
shows
the
complete
wreck
of
agriculture
the
yield
of
corn
in
this
district
is
so
abundant
that
wheat
is
often
sold
at
four
obols
a
sicilian
medimnus
about
eight
cents
by
the
bushel
or
a
little
less
than
two
sesterces
barley
at
two
or
a
metretes
of
wine
for
an
equal
measure
of
barley
the
cheapness
and
abundance
of
all
articles
of
food
may
also
be
clearly
shown
from
the
fact
that
travellers
in
these
parts
when
stopping
at
inns
do
not
bargain
for
particular
articles
but
simply
ask
what
the
charge
is
per
head
for
board
and
for
the
most
part
the
innkeepers
are
content
with
half
an
as
about
half
a
cent
a
day
these
prices
indicate
a
lack
of
demand
so
complete
that
the
debtors
among
the
peasantry
must
have
been
ruined
and
yet
remained
obdurate
gratuitous
distributions
were
tried
in
by
the
lex
clodia
but
soon
abandoned
as
costly
and
cæsar
applied
himself
to
reducing
the
outlay
on
the
needy
he
hoped
to
reach
his
end
by
cutting
down
the
number
of
by
providing
that
no
grain
should
be
given
away
except
on
presentation
of
a
ticket
and
by
ordering
that
the
number
of
should
not
be
increased
the
law
of
nature
prevailed
against
him
for
the
absorption
of
egypt
in
the
economic
system
of
the
empire
marked
in
the
words
of
mommsen
the
end
of
the
old
and
the
beginning
of
a
new
among
the
races
which
have
survived
through
ages
upon
scanty
nutriment
none
have
perhaps
excelled
the
egyptian
fellah
even
in
the
east
no
peasantry
has
probably
been
so
continuously
overworked
so
and
so
taxed
if
it
is
the
aim
of
the
state
to
work
out
the
utmost
possible
amount
from
its
territory
in
the
old
world
the
lagids
were
absolutely
the
masters
of
statecraft
in
particular
they
were
in
this
sphere
the
instructors
and
the
models
of
the
in
the
first
century
egypt
was
as
it
still
is
preeminently
a
land
of
cheap
labour
but
it
was
also
something
more
the
valley
of
the
nile
enriched
by
the
overflow
of
the
river
returned
an
without
manure
and
this
wonderful
district
was
administered
not
like
an
ordinary
province
but
like
a
private
farm
belonging
to
the
citizens
of
rome
the
emperor
reserved
it
to
himself
how
large
a
revenue
he
drew
from
it
is
immaterial
it
suffices
that
of
all
the
grain
consumed
in
the
capital
came
from
thence
according
to
athenæus
some
of
the
grain
ships
in
use
were
about
feet
long
by
broad
or
nearly
the
size
of
a
modern
steamer
in
the
atlantic
trade
from
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
therefore
the
wages
of
the
egyptian
fellah
regulated
the
price
of
the
cereals
within
the
limits
where
trade
was
made
free
by
roman
consolidation
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
thenceforward
such
of
the
highly
nourished
races
as
were
constrained
to
sustain
this
competition
were
doomed
to
perish
it
is
even
extremely
doubtful
whether
the
distributions
of
grain
by
the
government
materially
accelerated
the
march
of
the
decay
spain
should
have
been
far
enough
removed
from
the
centre
of
exchanges
to
have
had
a
certain
local
market
of
her
own
and
yet
martial
writing
about
described
the
spanish
husbandman
eating
and
drinking
the
produce
he
could
not
sell
and
receiving
but
four
sesterces
the
bushel
for
his
wheat
which
was
the
price
paid
by
paupers
in
the
time
of
cicero
thus
by
economic
necessity
great
estates
were
formed
in
the
hands
of
the
economically
strong
as
the
value
of
cereals
fell
arable
land
passed
into
vineyards
or
pasture
and
the
provinces
being
unable
to
sustain
their
old
population
eviction
went
on
with
gigantic
strides
had
the
romans
possessed
the
versatility
to
enable
them
to
turn
to
industry
factories
might
have
afforded
a
temporary
shelter
to
this
surplus
labour
but
manufactures
were
monopolized
by
the
east
therefore
the
beggared
peasantry
were
either
enslaved
for
debt
or
wandered
as
penniless
paupers
to
the
cities
where
gradually
their
numbers
so
increased
as
to
enable
them
to
extort
a
gratuitous
dole
indeed
during
the
third
century
their
condition
fell
so
low
that
they
were
unable
even
to
cook
the
food
freely
given
them
and
aurelian
had
their
bread
baked
at
public
ovens
as
centralization
advanced
with
the
acceleration
of
human
movement
force
expressed
itself
more
and
more
exclusively
through
money
and
the
channel
in
which
money
chose
to
flow
was
in
investments
in
land
the
social
system
fostered
the
growth
of
large
estates
the
romans
always
had
an
inordinate
respect
for
the
landed
magnate
and
a
contempt
for
the
tradesman
industry
was
reputed
a
servile
occupation
and
under
the
republic
the
citizen
who
performed
manual
labour
was
almost
deprived
of
political
rights
even
commerce
was
thought
so
unworthy
of
the
aristocracy
that
it
was
forbidden
to
senators
the
soil
was
always
in
this
roman
society
the
principal
source
and
above
all
the
only
measure
of
a
law
of
tiberius
obliged
capitalists
to
invest
of
their
property
in
land
trajan
not
only
exacted
of
aspirants
to
office
that
they
should
be
rich
but
that
they
should
place
at
least
of
their
fortune
in
italian
real
estate
and
down
to
the
end
of
the
empire
the
senatorial
class
was
at
the
same
time
the
class
of
great
landed
the
more
property
consolidated
the
more
resistless
the
momentum
of
capital
became
under
the
empire
small
properties
grew
steadily
rarer
and
the
fewer
they
were
the
greater
the
disadvantage
at
which
their
owners
stood
the
small
farmer
could
hardly
sustain
himself
in
competition
with
the
great
landlord
the
grand
domain
of
the
capitalist
was
not
only
provided
with
a
full
complement
of
labourers
and
shepherds
but
with
the
necessary
artisans
the
poor
farmer
depended
on
his
rich
neighbour
even
for
his
tools
he
was
what
a
workman
would
be
who
amidst
great
factories
worked
he
bought
dearer
and
sold
cheaper
his
margin
of
profit
steadily
shrunk
at
last
he
was
reduced
to
a
bare
subsistence
in
good
years
and
the
first
bad
harvest
left
him
bankrupt
the
roman
husbandman
and
soldier
was
doomed
for
nature
had
turned
against
him
the
task
of
history
is
but
to
ascertain
his
fate
and
trace
the
fortunes
of
his
country
after
he
had
gone
of
the
evicted
many
certainly
drifted
to
the
cities
and
lived
upon
charity
forming
the
proletariat
a
class
alike
despised
and
lost
to
some
were
sold
into
slavery
others
starved
but
when
all
deductions
have
been
made
a
surplus
is
left
to
be
accounted
for
and
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
these
stayed
on
their
farms
as
tenants
to
the
purchasers
in
the
first
century
such
tenancies
were
common
the
lessee
remained
a
freeman
under
no
subjection
to
his
landlord
provided
he
paid
his
rent
but
in
case
of
default
the
law
was
rigorous
everything
upon
the
land
was
liable
as
a
pledge
and
the
tenant
himself
was
held
in
pawn
unless
he
could
give
security
for
what
he
owed
in
case
therefore
of
prolonged
agricultural
depression
all
that
was
left
of
the
ancient
rural
population
could
hardly
fail
to
pass
into
the
condition
of
serfs
bound
to
the
land
by
debts
beyond
the
possibility
of
payment
that
such
a
depression
actually
occurred
and
that
it
extended
through
several
centuries
is
certain
nor
is
it
possible
that
its
only
cause
was
egyptian
competition
for
had
it
been
so
an
equilibrium
would
have
been
reached
when
the
african
exchanges
had
been
adjusted
whereas
a
continuous
decline
of
prices
went
on
until
long
after
the
fall
of
the
western
empire
the
only
other
possible
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
is
that
a
contraction
of
the
currency
began
soon
after
the
death
of
augustus
and
continued
without
much
interruption
down
to
charlemagne
between
the
fall
of
carthage
and
the
birth
of
christ
the
romans
plundered
the
richest
portions
of
the
world
west
of
the
indus
in
the
second
century
north
africa
macedon
spain
and
parts
of
greece
and
asia
minor
in
the
first
athens
cappadocia
syria
gaul
and
egypt
these
countries
yielded
an
enormous
mass
of
treasure
which
was
brought
to
rome
as
spoil
of
war
but
which
was
not
fixed
there
by
commercial
exchanges
and
which
continually
tended
to
flow
back
to
the
natural
centres
of
trade
therefore
when
conquests
ceased
the
sources
of
new
bullion
dried
up
and
the
quantity
held
in
italy
diminished
as
the
balance
of
trade
grew
more
and
more
unfavourable
under
augustus
the
precious
metals
were
plenty
and
cheap
and
the
prices
of
commodities
were
correspondingly
high
but
a
full
generation
had
hardly
passed
before
a
dearth
began
to
be
felt
which
manifested
itself
in
a
debasement
of
the
coinage
the
surest
sign
of
an
appreciation
of
the
currency
speaking
generally
the
manufactures
and
the
more
costly
products
of
antiquity
came
from
countries
to
the
east
of
the
adriatic
while
the
west
was
mainly
agricultural
and
nothing
is
better
established
than
that
luxuries
were
dear
under
the
empire
and
food
cheap
therefore
exchanges
were
unfavourable
to
the
capital
from
the
outset
the
exports
did
not
cover
the
imports
and
each
year
a
deficit
had
to
be
made
good
in
specie
the
romans
perfectly
understood
the
situation
and
this
adverse
balance
caused
them
much
uneasiness
tiberius
dwelt
upon
it
in
a
letter
to
the
senate
as
early
as
in
that
year
the
ædiles
brought
forward
proposals
for
certain
sumptuary
reforms
and
the
senate
probably
to
rid
itself
of
a
delicate
question
referred
the
matter
to
the
executive
most
of
the
emperor
s
reply
is
interesting
but
there
is
one
particularly
noteworthy
paragraph
if
a
reform
is
in
truth
intended
where
must
it
begin
and
how
am
i
to
restore
the
simplicity
of
ancient
times
how
shall
we
reform
the
taste
for
dress
how
are
we
to
deal
with
the
peculiar
articles
of
female
vanity
and
in
particular
with
that
rage
for
jewels
and
precious
trinkets
which
drains
the
empire
of
its
wealth
and
sends
in
exchange
for
bawbles
the
money
of
the
commonwealth
to
foreign
nations
and
even
to
the
enemies
of
rome
half
a
century
later
matters
were
apparently
worse
for
pliny
more
than
once
returned
to
the
subject
in
the
twelfth
book
of
his
natural
history
after
enumerating
the
many
spices
perfumes
drugs
and
gems
which
have
always
made
the
eastern
trade
of
such
surpassing
value
he
estimated
that
at
the
most
moderate
computation
sesterces
or
about
in
coin
were
annually
exported
to
arabia
and
india
alone
and
at
a
time
when
silk
was
worth
its
weight
in
gold
the
estimate
certainly
does
not
seem
excessive
he
added
so
dear
do
pleasures
and
women
cost
the
drain
to
egypt
and
the
asiatic
provinces
could
hardly
have
been
much
less
serious
adrian
almost
seems
to
have
been
jealous
of
the
former
for
in
his
letter
to
servianus
after
having
criticised
the
people
he
remarked
that
it
was
also
a
rich
and
productive
country
in
which
no
one
was
idle
and
in
which
glass
paper
and
linen
were
manufactured
the
syrians
were
both
industrial
and
commercial
tyre
for
example
worked
the
raw
silk
of
china
dyed
and
exported
it
the
glass
of
tyre
and
sidon
was
famous
the
local
aristocracy
were
merchants
and
manufacturers
and
as
later
the
riches
acquired
in
the
east
flowed
to
genoa
and
venice
so
then
the
commercial
gains
of
the
west
flowed
back
to
tyre
and
within
about
sixty
years
from
the
final
consolidation
of
the
empire
under
augustus
this
continuous
efflux
of
the
precious
metals
began
to
cause
the
currency
to
contract
and
prices
to
fall
and
the
first
effect
of
shrinking
values
appears
to
have
been
a
financial
crisis
in
probably
the
diminution
in
the
worth
of
commodities
relatively
to
money
had
already
made
it
difficult
for
debtors
to
meet
their
liabilities
for
tacitus
has
prefaced
his
story
by
pointing
out
that
usury
had
always
been
a
scourge
of
rome
and
that
just
previous
to
the
panic
an
agitation
against
the
had
begun
with
a
view
to
enforcing
the
law
regarding
interest
as
most
of
the
senators
were
deep
in
usury
they
applied
for
protection
to
tiberius
who
granted
what
amounted
to
a
stay
of
proceedings
and
then
as
soon
as
the
capitalists
felt
themselves
safe
they
proceeded
to
take
their
revenge
loans
were
called
accommodation
refused
and
mortgagors
were
ruthlessly
sold
out
there
was
great
scarcity
of
money
and
on
account
of
sales
on
execution
coin
accumulated
in
the
imperial
or
the
public
treasury
upon
this
the
senate
ordered
that
every
one
should
invest
of
his
capital
on
loan
in
italian
real
estate
but
the
creditors
called
in
the
whole
nor
did
public
opinion
allow
debtors
to
meanwhile
there
was
great
excitement
but
no
relief
as
the
usurers
hoarded
for
the
purpose
of
buying
low
the
quantity
of
sales
broke
the
market
and
the
more
liabilities
were
extended
the
harder
liquidation
became
many
were
ruined
and
the
loss
of
property
endangered
social
station
and
the
panic
finally
subsided
but
contraction
went
on
and
next
showed
itself
years
later
in
adulterated
coinage
from
the
time
of
the
punic
wars
about
two
centuries
and
a
half
before
christ
the
silver
denarius
worth
nearly
seventeen
cents
had
been
the
standard
of
the
roman
currency
and
it
kept
its
weight
and
purity
unimpaired
until
nero
when
it
diminished
from
to
of
a
pound
of
silver
the
pure
metal
being
mixed
with
of
copper
under
trajan
toward
the
alloy
reached
twenty
per
cent
under
septimius
severus
a
hundred
years
later
it
had
mounted
to
fifty
or
sixty
per
cent
and
by
the
time
of
elagabalus
the
coin
had
degenerated
into
a
token
of
base
metal
and
was
repudiated
by
the
government
something
similar
happened
to
the
gold
the
aureus
though
it
kept
its
fineness
lost
in
weight
down
to
constantine
in
the
reign
of
augustus
it
equalled
of
a
roman
pound
of
gold
in
that
of
nero
one
in
that
of
caracalla
but
in
that
of
diocletian
and
in
that
of
constantine
one
when
the
coin
ceased
passing
by
tale
and
was
taken
only
by
weight
the
repudiation
of
the
denarius
was
an
act
of
bankruptcy
nor
did
the
financial
position
improve
while
the
administration
remained
at
rome
therefore
the
inference
is
that
toward
the
middle
of
the
third
century
italy
had
lost
the
treasure
she
had
won
in
war
which
had
gradually
gravitated
to
the
centre
of
exchanges
this
inference
is
confirmed
by
history
the
movements
of
diocletian
seem
to
demonstrate
that
after
rome
ceased
to
be
either
the
political
or
commercial
capital
of
the
world
unquestionably
diocletian
must
have
lived
a
life
of
intense
activity
at
the
focus
of
affairs
to
have
raised
himself
from
slavery
to
the
purple
at
and
yet
gibbon
thought
he
did
not
even
visit
rome
until
he
went
thither
to
celebrate
his
triumph
after
he
had
been
twenty
years
upon
the
throne
he
never
seemed
anxious
about
the
temper
of
the
city
when
proclaimed
emperor
he
ignored
italy
and
established
himself
at
nicomedia
on
the
propontis
where
he
lived
until
he
abdicated
in
his
personal
preferences
evidently
did
not
influence
him
since
his
successors
imitated
his
policy
and
everything
points
to
the
conclusion
that
he
and
those
who
followed
him
only
yielded
to
the
same
resistless
force
which
fixed
the
economic
capital
of
the
world
upon
the
bosphorus
in
the
case
of
constantine
the
operation
of
this
force
was
conspicuous
for
it
was
not
only
powerful
enough
to
overcome
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
but
to
cause
him
to
undertake
the
gigantic
task
of
building
constantinople
constantine
was
proclaimed
in
britain
in
when
only
six
years
later
he
defeated
maxentius
and
then
governed
the
west
alone
until
his
war
with
licinius
whom
he
captured
in
and
afterward
put
to
death
thus
at
fifty
he
returned
to
the
east
after
an
absence
of
nearly
twenty
years
and
his
first
act
was
to
choose
byzantium
as
his
capital
a
city
nearly
opposite
nicomedia
the
sequence
of
events
seems
plain
very
soon
after
the
insolvency
of
the
government
at
rome
the
administration
quitted
the
city
and
moved
toward
the
boundary
between
europe
and
asia
there
after
some
forty
years
of
vacillation
it
settled
permanently
at
the
true
seat
of
exchanges
for
constantinople
remained
the
economic
centre
of
the
earth
for
more
than
eight
centuries
similar
conclusions
may
be
drawn
from
the
fluctuations
of
the
currency
at
rome
the
coin
could
not
be
maintained
at
the
standard
because
of
adverse
exchanges
but
when
the
political
and
economic
centres
had
come
to
coincide
at
a
point
upon
the
bosphorus
depreciation
ceased
and
the
aureus
fell
no
further
this
migration
of
capital
which
caused
the
rise
of
constantinople
was
the
true
opening
of
the
middle
ages
for
it
occasioned
the
gradual
decline
of
the
rural
population
and
thus
brought
about
the
disintegration
of
the
west
victory
carried
wealth
to
rome
and
wealth
manifested
its
power
in
a
permanent
police
as
the
attack
in
war
gained
upon
the
defence
and
individual
resistance
became
impossible
transportation
grew
cheap
and
safe
and
human
movement
was
accelerated
then
economic
competition
began
and
intensified
as
centralization
advanced
telling
always
in
favour
of
the
acutest
intellect
and
the
cheapest
labour
soon
exchanges
became
permanently
unfavourable
a
steady
drain
of
bullion
set
in
to
the
east
and
as
the
outflow
depleted
the
treasure
amassed
at
rome
by
plunder
contraction
began
and
with
contraction
came
that
fall
of
prices
which
first
ruined
then
enslaved
and
finally
exterminated
the
native
rural
population
of
italy
in
the
time
of
diocletian
the
ancient
silver
currency
had
long
been
repudiated
and
in
his
edict
he
spoke
of
prices
as
having
risen
ninefold
when
reckoned
in
the
denarii
of
base
metal
the
purchasing
power
of
pure
gold
and
silver
had
however
risen
very
considerably
in
all
the
western
provinces
nor
was
this
all
it
appears
to
be
a
natural
law
that
when
social
development
has
reached
a
certain
stage
and
capital
has
accumulated
sufficiently
the
class
which
has
had
the
capacity
to
absorb
it
shall
try
to
enhance
the
value
of
their
property
by
legislation
this
is
done
most
easily
by
reducing
the
quantity
of
the
currency
which
is
a
legal
tender
for
the
payment
of
debts
a
currency
obviously
gains
in
power
as
it
shrinks
in
volume
and
the
usurers
of
constantinople
intuitively
condensed
to
the
utmost
that
of
the
empire
after
the
insolvency
under
elagabalus
payments
were
exacted
in
gold
by
weight
and
as
it
grew
scarcer
its
value
rose
aurelian
issued
an
edict
limiting
its
use
in
the
arts
and
while
there
are
abundant
reasons
for
inferring
that
silver
also
gained
in
purchasing
power
gold
far
outstripped
it
although
no
statistics
remain
by
which
to
establish
with
any
exactness
the
movement
of
silver
in
comparison
with
commodities
the
ratio
between
the
precious
metals
at
different
epochs
is
known
and
gold
appears
to
have
doubled
between
cæsar
and
romulus
augustulus
gold
stood
to
silver
as
under
augustus
trajan
to
severus
constantine
theodosius
as
gold
had
become
the
sole
legal
tender
this
change
of
ratio
represents
a
diminution
during
the
existence
of
the
western
empire
of
at
least
fifty
per
cent
in
the
value
of
property
in
relation
to
debt
leaving
altogether
out
of
view
the
appreciation
of
silver
itself
which
was
so
considerable
that
the
government
was
unable
to
maintain
the
denarius
resistance
to
the
force
of
centralized
wealth
was
vain
aurelian
s
attempt
to
reform
the
mints
is
said
to
have
caused
a
rebellion
which
cost
him
the
lives
of
seven
thousand
of
his
soldiers
and
though
his
policy
was
continued
by
probus
and
diocletian
coined
both
metals
again
at
a
ratio
expansion
was
so
antagonistic
to
the
interests
of
the
monied
class
that
by
silver
was
definitely
discarded
and
gold
was
made
by
law
the
only
legal
tender
for
the
payment
of
debts
furthermore
the
usurers
protected
themselves
against
any
possible
tampering
with
the
mints
by
providing
that
the
solidus
should
pass
by
weight
and
not
by
tale
that
is
to
say
they
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
to
reject
any
golden
son
which
contained
less
than
one
of
a
pound
of
standard
metal
the
weight
fixed
by
constantine
thus
at
a
time
when
the
exhaustion
of
the
mines
caused
a
failure
in
the
annual
supply
of
bullion
the
old
composite
currency
was
split
in
two
and
the
half
retained
made
to
pass
by
weight
alone
so
as
to
throw
the
loss
by
clipping
and
abrasion
upon
the
debtor
so
strong
a
contraction
engendered
a
steady
fall
of
prices
a
fall
which
tended
rather
to
increase
than
diminish
as
time
went
on
but
in
prolonged
periods
of
decline
in
the
market
value
of
agricultural
products
farmers
can
with
difficulty
meet
a
money
rent
because
the
sale
of
their
crops
leaves
a
greater
deficit
each
year
and
finally
a
time
comes
when
insolvency
can
no
longer
be
postponed
in
his
opening
chapter
gibbon
described
the
empire
under
the
antonines
as
enjoying
a
happy
period
of
more
than
fourscore
years
of
peace
and
prosperity
and
yet
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
this
halcyon
age
was
in
reality
an
interval
of
agricultural
ruin
on
this
point
pliny
was
explicit
and
pliny
was
a
large
he
wrote
one
day
to
calvisius
about
an
investment
and
went
at
length
into
the
condition
of
the
property
a
large
estate
adjoining
his
own
was
for
sale
and
he
was
tempted
to
buy
for
the
land
was
fertile
rich
and
well
watered
the
fields
produced
vines
and
wood
which
promised
a
fair
return
and
yet
this
natural
fruitfulness
was
marred
by
the
misery
of
the
husbandmen
he
found
that
the
former
owner
had
often
seized
the
pignora
or
pledges
that
is
all
the
property
the
tenants
possessed
and
though
by
so
doing
he
had
temporarily
reduced
their
arrears
he
had
left
them
without
the
means
of
tilling
the
soil
these
tenants
were
freemen
who
had
been
unable
to
meet
their
rent
because
of
falling
prices
and
who
when
they
had
lost
their
tools
cattle
and
household
effects
were
left
paupers
on
the
farms
they
could
neither
cultivate
nor
abandon
consequently
the
property
had
suffered
the
rent
had
declined
and
for
these
reasons
and
the
general
hardness
of
the
times
its
value
had
fallen
from
five
million
to
three
million
sesterces
in
another
letter
he
explained
that
he
was
detained
at
home
making
new
arrangements
with
his
tenants
who
were
apparently
insolvent
for
in
the
last
five
years
in
spite
of
great
concessions
the
arrears
have
increased
for
this
reason
most
tenants
take
no
trouble
to
diminish
their
debt
which
they
despair
of
paying
indeed
they
plunder
and
consume
what
there
is
upon
the
land
since
they
think
they
can
not
save
for
the
remedy
he
proposed
was
to
make
no
more
money
leases
but
to
farm
on
shares
the
tone
of
these
letters
shows
that
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
all
this
pliny
nowhere
intimated
that
the
tenants
were
to
blame
or
that
better
men
were
to
be
had
on
the
contrary
he
said
emphatically
that
in
such
hard
times
money
could
not
be
collected
and
therefore
the
interest
of
the
landlord
was
to
cultivate
his
estates
on
shares
taking
the
single
precaution
to
place
slaves
over
the
tenants
as
overseers
and
receivers
of
the
crops
in
the
same
way
the
digest
referred
to
such
arrears
as
habitual
in
still
another
letter
to
trajan
pliny
observed
continuæ
sterilitates
cogunt
me
de
remissionibus
certainly
these
insolvent
farmers
could
have
held
no
better
position
when
working
on
shares
than
before
their
disasters
for
as
bankrupts
they
were
wholly
in
their
creditors
power
and
could
be
hunted
like
slaves
and
brought
back
in
fetters
if
they
fled
they
were
tied
to
the
property
by
a
debt
which
never
could
be
paid
and
they
and
their
descendants
were
doomed
to
stay
for
ever
as
or
serfs
chattels
to
be
devised
or
sold
as
part
of
the
realty
in
the
words
of
the
law
they
were
considered
slaves
of
the
the
ancient
martial
husbandman
had
thus
fallen
from
point
to
point
from
debt
to
debt
into
an
almost
perpetual
deliverance
was
impossible
for
payment
was
out
of
the
question
he
was
bound
to
the
soil
for
his
life
and
his
children
after
him
inherited
his
servitude
with
his
debt
the
customs
according
to
which
the
held
were
infinitely
varied
they
differed
not
only
between
estates
but
between
the
hands
on
the
same
estate
on
the
whole
however
the
life
must
have
been
hard
for
the
serfs
of
the
empire
did
not
multiply
and
the
scarcity
of
rural
labour
became
a
chronic
disease
yet
relatively
the
position
of
the
was
good
for
his
wife
and
children
were
his
own
slavery
was
the
ulcer
which
ate
into
the
flesh
and
the
roman
fiscal
system
coupled
as
it
was
with
usury
was
calculated
to
enslave
all
but
the
oligarchy
who
made
the
laws
the
taxes
of
the
provinces
were
assessed
by
the
censors
and
then
sold
for
cash
to
the
publicans
who
undertook
the
collection
italy
was
at
first
exempted
but
after
her
bankruptcy
she
shared
the
common
fate
companies
were
formed
to
handle
these
ventures
the
knights
usually
subscribed
the
capital
and
divided
the
profits
which
corresponded
with
the
severity
of
their
administration
and
as
the
roman
conquests
extended
these
companies
grew
too
powerful
to
be
controlled
the
only
officials
in
a
position
to
act
were
the
provincial
governors
who
were
afraid
to
interfere
and
preferred
to
share
in
the
gains
of
the
traffic
rather
than
to
run
the
risk
of
exciting
the
wrath
of
so
dangerous
an
enemy
according
to
pliny
the
collection
of
a
rent
in
money
had
become
impossible
in
the
reign
of
trajan
the
reason
was
that
with
a
contracting
currency
prices
of
produce
fell
and
each
year
s
crop
netted
less
than
that
of
the
year
before
therefore
a
rent
moderate
in
one
decade
was
extortionate
in
the
next
but
taxes
did
not
fall
with
the
fall
in
values
on
the
contrary
the
tendency
of
centralization
is
always
toward
a
more
costly
administration
under
augustus
one
emperor
with
a
moderate
household
sufficed
but
in
the
third
century
diocletian
found
it
necessary
to
reorganize
the
government
under
four
cæsars
and
everything
became
specialized
in
the
same
proportion
in
this
way
the
people
were
caught
between
the
upper
and
the
nether
millstone
the
actual
quantity
of
bullion
taken
from
them
was
greater
the
lower
prices
of
their
property
fell
and
arrears
of
taxes
accumulated
precisely
as
pliny
described
the
accumulation
of
arrears
of
rent
these
arrears
were
carried
over
from
reign
to
reign
and
even
from
century
to
century
and
petronius
the
of
valens
is
said
to
have
precipitated
the
rebellion
of
procopius
by
exacting
the
tribute
unpaid
since
the
death
of
aurelian
a
hundred
years
before
the
processes
employed
in
the
collection
of
the
revenue
were
severe
torture
was
freely
used
and
slavery
was
the
fate
of
defaulters
armed
with
such
power
the
publicans
held
debtors
at
their
mercy
though
usury
was
forbidden
the
most
lucrative
part
of
the
trade
was
opening
accounts
with
the
treasury
assuming
debts
and
charging
interest
sometimes
as
high
as
fifty
per
cent
though
as
prices
fell
the
pressure
grew
severer
the
abuses
of
the
administration
were
never
perhaps
worse
than
toward
the
end
of
the
republic
in
his
oration
against
verres
cicero
said
the
condition
of
the
people
had
become
intolerable
all
the
provinces
are
in

when

was

to
achaia
pliny
thought
it
well
to
write
him
a
long
letter
of
advice
in
which
he
not
only
declared
that
to
wrest
from
the
greeks
the
shadow
of
liberty
left
them
would
be

adjured
him
to
try

remember
what
each
city
had
been
and
not
to
despise
it
for
what
it
was
most
impressive
perhaps
of
all
is
the
statement
of
dio
cassius
that
the
revolt
led
by
boadicea
in
britain
in
which
cost
the
romans
seventy
thousand
lives
was
provoked
by
the
rapacity
of

who
having
forced
a

of
ten
million
drachmas
on
the
people
at
usurious
interest
suddenly
withdrew
his
money
thereby
inflicting
intense
suffering
as

with

and

and

of

between
the

and
the

from
the

to
the

within
sixty
years
after
the

of

on

an

in

of

it
is
true
that
gibbon
in
this
paragraph
described
italy
as
she
was
in
the
fourth
century
just
before
the
barbarian
invasions
but
a
similar
fate
had
overtaken
the
provinces
under
the
cæsars
in
the
reign
of
domitian

to
plutarch

had
been
almost
depopulated

would
the

which
was
heretofore
at

at

scarcely

you

in

so
much
as
a
herdsman
or
shepherd
in
those
wallon
has
observed
that
rome
in
the
early
times
of
the
republic
was
chiefly
preoccupied
with
having
a
numerous
and
strong
population
of
freemen
under
the
empire
she
had
but
one
anxiety
to
speak
with
more
precision
force
changed
the
channel
through
which
it
operated
native
farmers
and
native
soldiers
were
needless
when
such
material
could
be
bought
cheaper
in
the
north
or
east
with
money
the
cohorts
could
be
filled
with
germans
with
money
slaves
and
serfs
could
be
settled
upon
the
italian
fields
and
for
the
last
century
before
the
great
inroads
began
one
chief
problem
of
the
imperial
administration
was
the
regulation
of
the
inflow
of
new
blood
from
without
lacking
which
the
social
system
must
have
collapsed
the
later
campaigns
on
the
rhine
and
the
danube
were
really
on
a
gigantic
scale
probus
brought
back
sixteen
thousand
men
from
germany
the
bravest
and
most
robust
of
their
youth
and
distributed
them
in
knots
of
fifty
or
sixty
among
the
legions
their
aid
was
now
become
necessary
the
infrequency
of
marriage
and
the
ruin
of
agriculture
affected
the
principles
of
population
and
not
only
destroyed
the
strength
of
the
present
but
intercepted
the
hope
of
future
his
importations
of
agricultural
labour
were
much
more
considerable
in
a
single
settlement
in
thrace
probus
established
one
hundred
thousand
bastarnæ
constantius
chlorus
is
said
to
have
made
gaul
flourish
by
the
herds
of
slaves
he
distributed
among
the
landlords
in
large
numbers
of
alemanni
were
planted
in
the
valley
of
the
po
and
on
the
vast
spaces
of
the
public
domain
there
were
barbarian
villages
where
the
native
language
and
customs
were
preserved
probably
none
of
these
germans
came
as
freemen
many
of
course
were
captives
sold
as
slaves
but
perhaps
the
majority
were
serfs
frequently
a
tribe
hard
pressed
by
enemies
asked
leave
to
pass
the
frontier
and
settle
as
tributaries
that
is
to
say
as
on
one
such
occasion
constantius
ii
was
nearly
murdered
a
body
of
limigantes
who
had
made
a
raid
surrendered
and
petitioned
to
be
given
lands
at
any
distance
provided
they
might
have
protection
the
emperor
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
such
a
harvest
of
labourers
to
say
nothing
of
recruits
and
went
among
them
to
receive
their
submission
seeing
him
alone
the
barbarians
attacked
him
and
he
escaped
with
difficulty
his
troops
slaughtered
the
germans
to
the
last
man
this
unceasing
emigration
gradually
changed
the
character
of
the
rural
population
and
a
similar
alteration
took
place
in
the
army
as
early
as
the
time
of
cæsar
italy
was
exhausted
his
legions
were
mainly
raised
in
gaul
and
as
the
native
farmers
sank
into
serfdom
or
slavery
and
then
at
last
vanished
recruits
were
drawn
more
and
more
from
beyond
the
limits
of
the
empire
at
first
they
were
taken
singly
afterwards
in
tribes
and
nations
so
that
when
aëtius
defeated
attila
at
châlons
the
battle
was
fought
by
the
visigoths
under
theodoric
and
the
equipment
of
the
romans
and
huns
was
so
similar
that
when
drawn
up
the
lines
presented
the
image
of
civil
this
military
metamorphosis
indicated
the
extinction
of
the
martial
type
and
it
extended
throughout
society
rome
not
only
failed
to
breed
the
common
soldier
she
also
failed
to
produce
generals
after
the
first
century
the
change
was
marked
trajan
was
a
spaniard
septimius
severus
an
african
aurelian
an
illyrian
peasant
diocletian
a
dalmatian
slave
constantius
chlorus
a
dardanian
noble
and
the
son
of
constantius
by
a
dacian
woman
was
the
great
constantine
all
these
men
were
a
peculiar
species
of
military
adventurer
for
they
combined
qualities
which
made
them
not
only
effective
chiefs
of
police
but
acceptable
as
heads
of
the
civil
bureaucracy
which
represented
capital
severus
was
the
type
and
severus
has
never
been
better
described
than
by
machiavelli
who
said
he
united
the
ferocity
of
the
lion
to
the
cunning
of
the
fox
this
bureaucracy
was
the
core
of
the
consolidated
mass
called
the
empire
it
was
the
embodiment
of
money
the
ultimate
expression
of
force
and
it
recognized
and
advanced
men
who
were
adapted
to
its
needs
when
such
men
were
to
be
found
the
administration
was
thought
good
but
when
no
one
precisely
adapted
for
the
purple
appeared
and
an
ordinary
officer
had
to
be
hired
to
keep
the
peace
friction
was
apt
to
follow
and
the
soldier
even
though
of
the
highest
ability
was
often
removed
both
stilicho
and
aëtius
were
murdered
the
monied
oligarchy
which
formed
this
bureaucracy
was
a
growth
as
characteristic
of
the
high
centralization
of
the
age
as
a
sacred
caste
is
characteristic
of
decentralization
perhaps
the
capitalistic
class
of
the
later
empire
has
been
better
understood
and
appreciated
by
fustel
de
coulanges
than
by
any
other
historian
all
the
documents
which
show
the
spirit
of
the
epoch
show
that
this
noblesse
was
as
much
honoured
by
the
government
as
respected
by
the
people
it
was
from
it
that
the
imperial
government
chose
ordinarily
its
high
these
functionaries
were
not
sought
among
the
lower
classes
the
high
offices
were
not
given
as
a
reward
of
long
and
faithful
service
they
belonged
by
prescriptive
right
to
the
great
families
the
empire
made
the
wealthy
senators
prætors
consuls
and
governors
all
dignities
except
only
the
military
were
practically
hereditary
in
the
opulent
class
this
class
is
rich
and
the
government
is
poor
this
class
is
mistress
of
the
larger
part
of
the
soil
it
is
in
possession
of
the
local
dignities
of
the
administrative
and
judicial
functions
the
government
has
only
the
appearance
of
power
and
an
armed
force
which
is
continually
diminishing
the
aristocracy
had
the
land
the
wealth
the
distinction
the
education
ordinarily
the
morality
of
existence
it
did
not
know
how
to
fight
and
to
command
it
withdrew
itself
from
military
service
more
than
that
it
despised
it
it
was
one
of
the
characteristic
signs
of
this
society
to
have
always
placed
the
civil
functions
not
on
a
level
with
but
much
above
the
grades
of
the
army
it
esteemed
much
the
profession
of
the
doctor
of
the
professor
of
the
advocate
it
did
not
esteem
that
of
the
officer
and
the
soldier
and
left
it
to
men
of
low
this
supremacy
of
the
economic
instinct
transformed
all
the
relations
of
life
the
domestic
as
well
as
the
military
the
family
ceased
to
be
a
unit
the
members
of
which
cohered
from
the
necessity
of
and
became
a
business
association
marriage
took
the
form
of
a
contract
dissoluble
at
the
will
of
either
party
and
as
it
was
somewhat
costly
it
grew
rare
as
with
the
drain
of
their
bullion
to
the
east
which
crushed
their
farmers
the
romans
were
conscious
as
augustus
said
that
sterility
must
finally
deliver
their
city
into
the
hand
of
the
barbarians
they
knew
this
and
they
strove
to
avert
their
fate
and
there
is
little
in
history
more
impressive
than
the
impotence
of
the
ancient
civilization
in
its
conflict
with
nature
about
the
opening
of
the
christian
era
the
state
addressed
itself
to
the
task
probably
in
the
year
the
emperor
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
first
legislation
favouring
marriage
and
this
enactment
not
proving
effective
it
was
supplemented
by
the
famous
leges
julia
and
papia
poppæa
of
the
year
in
the
spring
at
the
games
the
knights
demanded
the
repeal
of
these
laws
and
then
augustus
having
called
them
to
the
forum
made
them
the
speech
whose
violence
now
seems
incredible
those
who
were
single
were
the
worst
of
criminals
they
were
murderers
they
were
impious
they
were
destroyers
of
their
race
they
resembled
brigands
or
wild
beasts
he
asked
the
if
they
expected
men
to
start
from
the
ground
to
replace
them
as
in
the
fable
and
declared
in
bitterness
that
while
the
government
liberated
slaves
for
the
sole
purpose
of
keeping
up
the
number
of
citizens
the
children
of
the
marcii
of
the
fabii
of
the
valerii
and
the
julii
let
their
names
perish
from
the
earth
in
vain
celibacy
was
made
almost
criminal
in
vain
celibates
were
declared
incapable
of
inheriting
while
fathers
were
offered
every
bribe
were
preferred
in
appointments
to
office
were
even
given
the
choice
seats
at
games
in
the
words
of
tacitus
not
for
that
did
marriage
and
children
increase
for
the
advantages
of
childlessness
all
that
was
done
was
to
breed
a
race
of
informers
and
to
stimulate
the
lawyers
to
fresh
chicane
when
wealth
became
force
the
female
might
be
as
strong
as
the
male
therefore
she
was
emancipated
through
easy
divorce
she
came
to
stand
on
an
equality
with
the
man
in
the
marriage
contract
she
controlled
her
own
property
because
she
could
defend
it
and
as
she
had
power
she
exercised
political
privileges
in
the
third
century
julia
domna
julia
mamæa
soæmias
and
others
sat
in
the
senate
or
conducted
the
administration
the
evolution
of
this
centralized
society
was
as
logical
as
every
other
work
of
nature
when
force
reached
the
stage
where
it
expressed
itself
exclusively
through
money
the
governing
class
ceased
to
be
chosen
because
they
were
valiant
or
eloquent
artistic
learned
or
devout
and
were
selected
solely
because
they
had
the
faculty
of
acquiring
and
keeping
wealth
as
long
as
the
weak
retained
enough
vitality
to
produce
something
which
could
be
absorbed
this
oligarchy
was
invincible
and
for
very
many
years
after
the
native
peasantry
of
gaul
and
italy
had
perished
under
the
load
new
blood
injected
from
more
tenacious
races
kept
the
dying
civilization
alive
the
weakness
of
the
monied
class
lay
in
their
very
power
for
they
not
only
killed
the
producer
but
in
the
strength
of
their
acquisitiveness
they
failed
to
propagate
themselves
the
state
feigned
to
regard
marriage
as
a
debt
and
yet
the
opulent
families
died
out
in
the
reign
of
augustus
all
but
fifty
of
the
patrician
houses
had
become
extinct
and
subsequently
the
emperor
seemed
destined
to
remain
the
universal
heir
through
bequests
of
the
childless
with
the
peasantry
the
case
was
worse
by
the
second
century
barbarian
labour
had
to
be
imported
to
till
the
fields
and
even
the
barbarians
lacked
the
tenacity
of
life
necessary
to
endure
the
strain
they
ceased
to
breed
and
the
population
dwindled
then
somewhat
suddenly
the
collapse
came
with
shrinking
numbers
the
sources
of
wealth
ran
dry
the
revenue
failed
to
pay
the
police
and
on
the
efficiency
of
the
police
the
life
of
this
unwarlike
civilization
hung
in
early
ages
every
roman
had
been
a
and
every
had
been
a
soldier
serving
without
pay
to
fight
had
been
as
essential
a
part
of
life
as
to
plough
but
by
the
fourth
century
military
service
had
become
commercial
the
legions
were
as
purely
an
expression
of
money
as
the
bureaucracy
itself
from
the
time
of
the
servian
constitution
downward
the
change
in
the
army
had
kept
pace
with
the
acceleration
of
movement
which
caused
the
economic
competition
that
centralized
the
state
rome
owed
her
triumphs
over
hannibal
and
pyrrhus
to
the
valour
of
her
infantry
rather
than
to
the
genius
of
her
generals
but
from
marius
the
census
ceased
to
be
the
basis
of
recruitment
and
the
rich
refused
to
serve
in
the
ranks
this
was
equivalent
in
itself
to
a
social
revolution
for
from
the
moment
when
the
wealthy
succeeded
in
withdrawing
themselves
from
service
and
the
poor
saw
in
it
a
trade
the
citizen
ceased
to
be
a
soldier
and
the
soldier
became
a
mercenary
from
that
time
the
army
could
be
used
for
all
purposes
provided
that
they
could
count
on
their
pay
and
their
the
administration
of
augustus
organized
the
permanent
police
which
replaced
the
mercenaries
of
the
civil
wars
and
this
machine
was
the
greatest
triumph
and
the
crowning
glory
of
capital
dio
cassius
has
described
how
the
last
vestige
of
an
italian
army
passed
away
up
to
the
time
of
severus
it
had
been
customary
to
recruit
the
prætorians
either
from
italy
itself
from
spain
macedonia
or
other
neighbouring
countries
whose
population
had
some
affinity
with
that
of
latium
severus
after
the
treachery
of
the
guard
to
pertinax
disbanded
it
and
reorganized
a
corps
selected
from
the
bravest
soldiers
of
the
legions
these
men
were
a
horde
of
barbarians
repulsive
to
italians
in
their
habits
and
terrible
to
look
upon

stood
at

the

may
have
prolonged
the

of

for
above
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
the
city
which
constantine
planted
in
on
the
shore
of
the
bosphorus
was
in
reality
a
horde
of
roman
capitalists
washed
to
the
confines
of
asia
by
the
current
of
foreign
exchanges
and
these
emigrants
carried
with
them
to
a
land
of
mixed
greek
and
barbarian
blood
their
language
and
their
customs
for
many
years
these
monied
potentates
ruled
their
new
country
absolutely
all
that
legislation
could
do
for
them
was
done
they
even
annexed
rations
to
their

to
be
supplied
at
the
public
cost

their

their

as
long
as

fell
nothing
availed
the

grew
poorer
day
by

their
property
lay
generally
in

and
the
same
stringency
which
wasted
italy
and
gaul
operated
though
perhaps
less
acutely
upon
the
danubian
peasantry
also
by
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
the
country
was
exhausted
and
at
the
mercy
of
the

the
weapon
of
a
monied
society
for
though
itself
lacking
the
martial
instinct
it
can
with
money
hire
soldiers
to
defend
it
but
to
raise
a
revenue
from
the
people
they
must
retain
a
certain
surplus
of
income
after
providing
for
subsistence
otherwise
the
government
must
trench
on
the
supply
of
daily
food
and
exhaustion
must
supervene
finlay
has
explained
that
chronic
exhaustion
was
the
normal
condition
of
byzantium
under
the
romans
the
whole
surplus
profits
of
society
were
annually
drawn
into
the
coffers
of
the
state
leaving
the
inhabitants
only
a
bare
sufficiency
for
perpetuating
the
race
of
history
indeed
shows
that
the
agricultural
classes
from
the
labourer
to
the
landlord
were
unable
to
retain
possession
of
the
savings
required
to
replace
that
depreciation
which
time
is
constantly
producing
in
all
vested
capital
and
that
their
numbers
gradually
under
theodosius
when
gold
reached
its
maximum
complete
prostration
prevailed
the
huns
marched
whither
they
would
and
one
swarm
of
barbarians
followed
another
as
long
as
anything
was
left
to
the
government
could
no
longer
keep
armies
in
the
field
a
single
example
will
show
how
low
the
community
had
fallen
in
attila
demanded
of
theodosius
six
thousand
pounds
of
gold
as
a
condition
of
peace
and
certainly
six
thousand
pounds
of
gold
equalling
perhaps
was
a
small
sum
even
when
measured
by
the
standard
of
private
wealth
the
end
of
the
third
century
was
not
a
prosperous
period
in
italy
and
yet
before
his
election
as
emperor
in
the
fortune
of
tacitus
reached
sesterces
or
upwards
of
nevertheless
theodosius
was
unable
to
wring
this
inconsiderable
indemnity
from
the
people
and
he
had
to
levy
a
private
assessment
on
the
senators
who
were
themselves
so
poor
that
to
pay
they
sold
at
auction
the
jewels
of
their
wives
and
the
furniture
of
their
houses
almost
immediately
after
the
collapse
of
the
western
empire
the
tide
turned
with
the
fall
in
the
price
of
gold
the
peasantry
revived
and
the
greek
provinces
flourished
in
the
reign
of
justinian
belisarius
and
narses
marched
from
end
to
end
of
africa
and
europe
and
anastasius
rolled
in
wealth
anastasius
the
contemporary
of
theoderic
acceded
to
the
throne
in
he
not
only
built
the
famous
long
wall
from
the
propontis
to
the
euxine
and
left
behind
him
a
treasure
of
three
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
pounds
of
gold
but
he
remitted
to
his
subjects
the
most
oppressive
of
their
taxes
and
the
reign
of
justinian
who
succeeded
him
at
an
interval
of
only
ten
years
must
always
rank
as
the
prime
of
the
byzantine
civilization
the
observation
is
not
new
it
has
been
made
by
all
students
of
byzantine
history
the
increased
prosperity
infused
into
society
soon
displayed
its
effects
and
the
brilliant
exploits
of
the
reign
of
justinian
must
be
traced
back
to
the
reinvigoration
of
the
body
politic
of
the
roman
empire
by
justinian
inherited
the
throne
from
his
uncle
justin
a
dardanian
peasant
who
could
neither
read
nor
write
but
the
barbarian
shepherd
was
a
thorough
soldier
and
the
army
he
left
behind
him
was
probably
not
inferior
to
the
legions
of
titus
or
trajan
at
all
events
had
justinian
s
funds
sufficed
there
seems
reason
to
suppose
he
might
have
restored
the
boundaries
of
the
empire
his
difficulty
lay
not
in
lack
of
physical
force
but
in
dearth
of
opulent
enemies
in
the
sixth
century
conquest
had
ceased
to
be
profitable
the
territory
open
to
invasion
had
been
harried
for
generations
and
hardly
a
country
was
to
be
found
rich
enough
to
repay
the
cost
of
a
campaign
by
mercenaries
therefore
the
more
the
emperor
extended
his
dominions
the
more
they
languished
and
finally
to
provide
for
wars
barbarian
subsidies
and
building
justinian
had
to
resort
to
with
renewed
want
came
renewed
decay
and
perhaps
the
completion
of
saint
sophia
in
may
be
taken
as
the
point
whence
the
race
which
conceived
this
masterpiece
hastened
to
its
extinction
in
the
seventh
century
asiatic
competition
devoured
the
europeans
in
the
levant
as
three
hundred
years
before
it
had
devoured
the
husbandmen
of
italy
and
this
was
a
disease
which
isolation
alone
could
cure
but
isolation
of
the
centre
of
exchanges
was
impossible
for
the
vital
principle
of
an
economic
age
is
competition
and
when
the
relief
afforded
by
the
collapse
of
rome
had
been
exhausted
competition
did
its
work
with
relentless
rapidity
under
heraclius
the
population
sank
fast
and
by
the
western
blood
had
run
so
low
that
an
asiatic
dynasty
reigned
supreme
everywhere
greeks
and
romans
vanished
before
armenians
and
slavs
and
for
years
previous
to
the
accession
of
leo
the
isaurian
the
great

where
they
once

were
systematically
repeopled

s
death
in

revolution

been
completed
the

had
been

constantinople
had
become
an
asiatic
city
the

was
armenian
as
strong
an
economic
type
as
ever
existed
in
western
asia
while
the
slavic
peasantry
which
underlay
them
were
among
the
most
enduring
of
mankind
there
competition
ended
for
it
could
go
no
further
and
apparently
from
the
accession
of
leo
in
to
the
rise
of
florence
and
venice
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
later
byzantine
society

fixity
almost
resembled

from

until

of

can
not
remark
a
single
change
in
the
modes
of
only
long
after
when
the
money
which
sustained
it
was
diverted
toward
italy
during

did
the

declared
that
the
third
quarter
of
the
tenth
century

the
most
splendid
period
of

byzantine
the
later

was
an
economic
civilization
without
aspiration
or
imagination
and
perhaps
the
most
vivid
description
which
has
survived
of
that
ostentatious
sordid
cowardly
and
stagnant
race
is
the
little
sketch
of
the
jew

of

who
travelled
to
the
levant
in
benjamin
called
the
inhabitants
of
constantinople
greeks
because
of
their
language
and
he
described
the
city
as
a
vast
commercial
metropolis
common
to
all
the
world
without
distinction
of

or

from
the
east

west
flocked
thither
from
babylon

the

dwelt
with
delight
on

its
columns
of
gold
and
silver
and
the
wonderful
crown
so
studded
with
gems
that
it
lighted
the
night
without

the
greeks
also
roused
his
enthusiasm
for
the
splendour
of
their
clothes
and
of
their
horses

for
when
they
went
abroad
they
resembled

but
on
the
other
hand
he
remarked
with
a
certain
scorn
that
they
were
utterly
cowardly
and
like

to

this

alteration
but
after
the
final
division
of

in
between

a

change

with

minuteness
of

of

at

strange
devices
have
appeared
on
the
reverse
together
with
greek
letters
a
century
later
when
the
great
decline
was
in
progress
under
heraclius
the
type
had
become
barbarous
and
the
prevalence
of
greek
inscriptions
proves
the
steady
exhaustion
of
the
roman
blood
another
fifty
years
and
by
under
justinian
the
permanent
and
conventional
phase
had
been
developed
religious
emblems
were
used
the
head
of
christ
was
struck
on
the

and
fixity
of

asiatic

all
were
changeless
and
in
an
armenian
dynasty
ascended
the
throne
in
the
person
of
leo
the
isaurian
this
motionless
period
lasted
for
full
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
as
long
as
the
exchanges
of
the
world
centred
at
byzantium
and
the
monied
race
who
dwelt
there
sucked
copious
nutriment
from
the
pool
of
wealth
in
which
it
lay
but
even
before
the
crusades
the
tide
of
trade
began
to
flow
to
the
south
and
quitting
constantinople
passed
directly
from
bagdad
to
the
cities
of
italy
then
the
sustenance
of

failed

and
debasement
began
this
revolution
marked
the
beginning
of
the
end
immediately
preceding
the
crusades
and
attended
by
sharp
distress
it
was
probably
engendered
by
an
alteration
in
the
drift
of
foreign
exchanges
certainly
the
currency
contracted
sharply
and
the
gold
money
soon
became
so
bad
that
alexius
had
to
stipulate
to
pay
his
debts
in
the
byzants
of
his
predecessor
michael
for
the
next
hundred
years
as
the
italian
cities
rose
the
empire
languished
and
with
the
thirteenth
century
when
venice
established
its
permanent
silver
standard
by
coining

crumbled
into
ruin
in

the
same
phenomena
appear
only
differently
clothed
though
the
germans
who
swarmed
across
the
danube
often
surged
against
the
walls
of
constantinople
they
never
became
the
ruling
class
of
the
community
because
they
were
of
the
imaginative
type
money
retained
its
supremacy
and
while
it
did
so
energy
expressed
itself
through
the
economic
mind
though
justinian
was
of
barbarian
blood
the
nephew
of
a
barbarian
shepherd
the
aristocracy
about
him
which
formed
the
core
of
society
was
neither
imaginative
nor
devotional
hardly
christian
it
tended
toward
paganism
or
scepticism
the
artists
were
of
the
subject
caste
and
they
earned
their
living
by
gratifying
the
tastes
of
the
nobles
but
the
nobles
loved
magnificence
and
gorgeous
functions
hence
all
byzantine
architecture
favoured
display
and
nowhere
more
so
than
in
saint
sophia
art
delighted
in
representing

in
all
the

of

into
the
glory
of
an
imaginative
age
the
germans
who
overran
the
roman
territory
were
of
the
same
race
as
the
greeks
the
latins
or
the
gauls
but
in
a
different
stage
of
development
they
tilled
farms
and
built
villages
and
perhaps
fortresses
but
they
were
not
consolidated
and
had
neither
nations
nor
federations
they
were
substantially
in
the
condition
in
which
the
common
family
had
been
when
it
divided
many
centuries
before
and
their
minds
differed
radically
from
the
minds
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
countries
beyond
the
danube
and
the
rhine
they
were
infinitely
more
imaginative
and
as
the
flood
of
emigration
poured
down
from
the
north
the
imagination
came
more
and
more
to
prevail
although
the
lowest
of
existing
savages
are
relatively
advanced
they
suggest
that
the
strongest
passion
of
primeval
man
must
have
been
fear
and
fear
not
so
much
of
living
things
as
of
nature
which
seemed
to
him
resolutely
hostile
against
wild
beasts
or
savages
like
himself
he
might
prevail
by
cunning
or
by
strength
but
against
drought
and
famine
pestilence
and
earthquake
he
was
helpless
and
he
regarded
these
scourges
as
malevolent
beings
made
like
himself
only
more
formidable
his
first
and
most
pressing
task
was
to
mollify
them
and
above
the
warrior
class
rose
the
sacred
caste
whose
function
was
to
mediate
between
the
visible
and
the
invisible
world
originally
these
intercessors
appear
to
have
been
sorcerers
rather
than
priests
for
spirits
were
believed
to
be
hostile
to
man
and
perhaps
the
first
conception
of
a
god
may
have
been
reached
through
the
victory
of
a
clan
of
sorcerers
in
fight
as
statius
said
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
primus
in
orbe
deos
fecit
probably
the
early
wizards
won
their
power
by
the
discovery
of
natural
secrets
which
though
they
could
be
transmitted
to
their
descendants
might
also
be
discovered
by
strangers
the
later
discoverers
would
become
rival
medicine
men
and
battle
would
be
the
only
test
by
which
the
orthodoxy
of
the
competitors
could
be
determined
the
victors
would
almost
certainly
stigmatize
the
beings
the
vanquished
served
as
devils
who
tormented
men
there
is
an
example
of
this
process
in
the
eighteenth
chapter
of
kings
and
elijah
said
how
long
halt
ye
between
two
opinions
if
the
lord
be
god
follow
him
but
if
baal
then
follow
him
and
the
people
answered
him
not
a
then
elijah
proposed
that
each
side
should
dress
a
bullock
and
lay
it
on
wood
and
call
upon
their
spirit
and
the
one
who
sent
down
fire
should
be
god
and
all
the
people
answered
that
it
was
well
spoken
and
jezebel
s
prophets
took
their
bullock
and
dressed
it
and
called
on
baal
from
morning
even
until
noon
saying
o
baal
hear
us
but
nothing
came
of
it
then
elijah
mocked
them
and
said
cry
aloud
either
he
is
talking
or
he
is
pursuing
or
he
is
in
a
journey
or
peradventure
he
sleepeth
and
must
be
and
they
cried
aloud
and
cut
themselves
with
knives
till
blood
gushed
out
upon
them
and
there
was
neither
voice
nor
any
to
then
elijah
built
his
altar
and
cut
up
his
bullock
and
laid
him
on
wood
and
poured
twelve
barrels
of
water
over
the
whole
and
filled
a
trench
with
water
and
the
fire
of
the
lord
fell
and
consumed
the
burnt
sacrifice
and
the
wood
and
the
stones
and
the
dust
and
licked
up
the
water
that
was
in
the
trench
and
when
all
the
people
saw
it
they
fell
on
their
faces
and
they
said
the
lord
he
is
the
god
and
elijah
said
unto
them
take
the
prophets
of
baal
let
not
one
of
them
escape
and
they
took
them
and
elijah
brought
them
down
to
the
brook
kishon
and
slew
them
the
germans
of
the
fourth
century
were
a
very
simple
race
who
comprehended
little
of
natural
laws
and
who
therefore
referred
phenomena
they
did
not
understand
to
supernatural
intervention
this
intervention
could
only
be
controlled
by
priests
and
thus
the
invasions
caused
a
rapid
rise
in
the
influence
of
the
sacred
class
the
power
of
every
ecclesiastical
organization
has
always
rested
on
the
miracle
and
the
clergy
have
always
proved
their
divine
commission
as
did
elijah
this
was
eminently
the
case
with
the
mediæval
church
at
the
outset
christianity
was
socialistic
and
its
spread
among
the
poor
was
apparently
caused
by
the
pressure
of
competition
for
the
sect
only
became
of
enough
importance
to
be
persecuted
under
nero
contemporaneously
with
the
first
signs
of
distress
which
appeared
through
the
debasement
of
the
denarius
but
socialism
was
only
a
passing
phase
and
disappeared
as
the
money
value
of
the
miracle
rose
and
brought
wealth
to
the
church
under
the
emperor
decius
about
the
magistrates
thought
the
christians
opulent
enough
to
use
gold
and
silver
vessels
in
their
service
and
by
the
fourth
century
the
supernatural
so
possessed
the
popular
mind
that
constantine
not
only
allowed
himself
to
be
converted
by
a
miracle
but
used
enchantment
as
an
engine
of
war
in
one
of
his
marches
he
encouraged
the
belief
that
he
saw
a
luminous
cross
in
the
sky
with
the
words
by
this
the
next
night
christ
appeared
to
him
and
directed
him
to
construct
a
standard
bearing
the
same
design
and
armed
with
this
to
advance
with
confidence
against
maxentius
the
legend
preserved
by
eusebius
grew
up
after
the
event
but
for
that
very
reason
it
reflects
the
feeling
of
the
age
the
imagination
of
his
men
had
grown
so
vivid
that
whether
he
believed
or
not
constantine
found
it
expedient
to
use
the
labarum
as
a
charm
to
ensure
victory
the
standard
supported
a
cross
and
a
mystic
monogram
the
army
believed
its
guards
to
be
invulnerable
and
in
his
last
and
most
critical
campaign
against
licinius
the
sight
of
the
talisman
not
only
excited
his
own
troops
to
enthusiasm
but
spread
dismay
through
the
enemy
the
action
of
the
milvian
bridge
fought
in
by
which
constantine
established
himself
at
rome
was
probably
the
point
whence
nature
began
to
discriminate
decisively
against
the
monied
type
in
western
europe
capital
had
already
abandoned
italy
christianity
was
soon
after
officially
recognized
and
during
the
next
century
the
priest
began
to
rank
with
the
soldier
as
a
force
in
war
meanwhile
as
the
population
sank
into
exhaustion
it
yielded
less
and
less
revenue
the
police
deteriorated
and
the
guards
became
unable
to
protect
the
frontier
in
the
goths
hard
pressed
by
the
huns
came
to
the
danube
and
implored
to
be
taken
as
subjects
by
the
emperor
after
mature
deliberation
the
council
of
valens
granted
the
prayer
and
some
five
hundred
thousand
germans
were
cantoned
in
mœsia
the
intention
of
the
government
was
to
scatter
this
multitude
through
the
provinces
as
coloni
or
to
draft
them
into
the
legions
but
the
detachment
detailed
to
handle
them
was
too
feeble
the
goths
mutinied
cut
the
guard
to
pieces
and
having
ravaged
thrace
for
two
years
defeated
and
killed
valens
at
hadrianople
in
another
generation
the
disorganization
of
the
roman
army
had
become
complete
and
alaric
gave
it
its
deathblow
in
his
campaign
of
alaric
was
not
a
gothic
king
but
a
barbarian
deserter
who
in
was
in
the
service
of
theodosius
subsequently
he
sometimes
held
imperial
commands
and
sometimes
led
bands
of
marauders
on
his
own
account
but
was
always
in
difficulty
about
his
pay
finally
in
the
revolution
in
which
stilicho
was
murdered
a
corps
of
auxiliaries
mutinied
and
chose
him
their
general
alleging
that
his
arrears
were
unpaid
alaric
accepted
the
command
and
with
this
army
sacked
rome
during
the
campaign
the
attitude
of
the
christians
was
more
interesting
than
the
strategy
of
the
soldiers
alaric
was
a
robber
leading
mutineers
and
yet
the
orthodox
historians
did
not
condemn
him
they
did
not
condemn
him
because
the
sacred
class
instinctively
loved
the
barbarians
whom
they
could
overawe
whereas
they
could
make
little
impression
on
the
materialistic
intellect
of
the
old
centralized
society
under
the
empire
the
priests
like
all
other
individuals
had
to
obey
the
power
which
paid
the
police
and
as
long
as
a
revenue
could
be
drawn
from
the
provinces
the
christian
hierarchy
were
subordinate
to
the
monied
bureaucracy
who
had
the
means
to
coerce
them
it
was
long
since
established
as
a
fundamental
maxim
of
the
roman
constitution
that
every
rank
of
citizens
were
alike
subject
to
the
laws
and
that
the
care
of
religion
was
the
right
as
well
as
duty
of
the
civil
their
conversion
made
little
change
in
the
attitude
of
the
emperors
and
constantine
and
his
successors
continued
to
exercise
a
supreme
jurisdiction
over
the
hierarchy
the
sixteenth
book
of
the
theodosian
code
sufficiently
sets
forth
the
plenitude
of
their
authority
in
theory
bishops
were
elected
by
the
clergy
and
the
people
but
in
practice
the
emperor
could
control
the
patronage
if
it
were
valuable
and
whether
bishops
were
elected
or
appointed
as
long
as
they
were
created
and
paid
by
laymen
they
were
dependent
the
priesthood
could
only
become
autocratic
when
fear
of
the
miracle
exempted
them
from
arrest
and
toward
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
this
point
was
approaching
as
appears
by
the
effect
of
the
embassy
of
leo
the
great
to
attila
in
the
huns
had
crossed
the
alps
and
had
sacked
aquileia
the
roman
army
was
demoralized
aëtius
could
not
make
head
against
the
barbarians
in
the
field
while
valentinian
was
so
that
he
abandoned
ravenna
which
was
thought
impregnable
and
retreated
to
the
capital
which
was
indefensible
at
rome
finding
himself
helpless
in
an
open
city
the
emperor
conceived
the
idea
of
invoking
the
power
of
the
supernatural
he
proposed
to
leo
to
visit
attila
and
persuade
him
to
spare
the
town
the
pope
consented
without
hesitation
and
with
perfect
intrepidity
caused
himself
to
be
carried
to
the
hun
s
tent
where
he
met
with
respect
not
unalloyed
by
fear
the
legend
probably
reflects
pretty
accurately
the
feeling
of
the
time
as
the
bishop
stood
before
the
king
peter
and
paul
appeared
on
either
side
menacing
attila
with
flaming
swords
and
though
this
particular
form
of
apparition
may
be
doubted
attila
seems
beyond
question
to
have
been
oppressed
by
a
belief
that
he
would
not
long
survive
the
capture
of
rome
he
therefore
readily
agreed
to
accept
a
ransom
and
evacuate
italy
from
the
scientific
standpoint
the
saint
and
the
sorcerer
are
akin
for
though
the
saint
uses
the
supernatural
for
man
s
benefit
and
the
sorcerer
for
his
hurt
both
deal
in
magic
the
mediæval
saint
was
a
powerful
necromancer
he
healed
the
sick
cast
out
devils
raised
the
dead
foretold
the
future
put
out
fires
found
stolen
property
brought
rain
saved
from
shipwreck
routed
the
enemy
cured
headache
was
sovereign
in
and
indeed
could
do
almost
anything
that
was
asked
of
him
whether
he
were
alive
or
dead
this
power
was
believed
to
lie
in
some
occult
property
of
the
flesh
which
passed
by
contact
the
woman
in
the
bible
said
if
i
may
touch
but
his
clothes
i
shall
be
moreover
this
fluid
was
a
substance
whose
passage
could
be
felt
for
jesus
immediately
knowing
in
himself
that
virtue
had
gone
out
of
him
turned
him
about
in
the
press
and
said
who
touched
my
clothes
anything
which
came
in
contact
with
the
saint
was
likely
to
have
been
impregnated
with
this
magical
quality
and
thus
became
a
charm
or
relic
whose
value
depended
primarily
on
the
power
of
the
man
himself
and
secondly
on
the
thoroughness
with
which
the
material
had
been
charged
the
tomb
which
held
the
whole
body
naturally
stood
highest
then
parts
of
the
body
according
to
their
importance
a
head
an
arm
a
leg
down
to
hairs
of
the
beard
then
came
hats
boots
girdles
cups
anything
indeed
which
had
been
used
the
very
ground
on
which
a
great
had
stood
might
have
high
value
the
holy
grail
which
had
held
christ
s
blood
would
cure
wounds
raise
the
dead
and
fill
itself
with
choice
food
at
the
command
of
the
owner
the
eucharist
though
not
properly
a
relic
and
which
only
became
god
through
an
incantation
would
in
expert
hands
stop
fires
cure
disease
cast
out
devils
expound
philosophy
and
detect
perjury
by
choking
the
liar
every
prize
in
life
was
to
be
obtained
by
this
kind
of
magic
when
the
kings
of
france
made
war
they
carried
with
them
the
enchanted
banner
of
saint
denis
and
froissart
has
told
how
even
in
the
reign
of
charles
vi
it
decided
the
battle
of
roosebeke
disease
was
treated
altogether
by
miracle
and
the
church
found
the
business
so
profitable
that
she
anathematized
experimental
practitioners
in
the
thirteenth
century
saint
thomas
of
canterbury
and
saint
james
of
compostello
were
among
the
most
renowned
of
healers
and
their
shrines
blazed
with
the
gifts
of
the
greatest
and
richest
persons
of
europe
when
philip
augustus
lay
very
ill
louis
the
pious
obtained
leave
to
visit
the
tomb
of
saint
thomas
then
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
and
left
as
part
of
his
fee
the
famous
regal
of
france
a
jewel
so
magnificent
that
three
centuries
and
a
half
later
henry
viii
seized
it
and
set
it
in
a
thumb
ring
beside
this
wonderful
gem
at
the
pillage
of
the
reformation
the
king
s
receiver
confessed
that
the
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
and
sacred
vestments
taken
away
filled
the
old
books
of
travel
are
filled
with
accounts
of
this
marvellous
shrine
but
the
magnificence
of
the
tomb
of
saint
thomas
the
martyr
archbishop
of
canterbury
is
that
which
surpasses
all
belief
this
notwithstanding
its
great
size
is
entirely
covered
with
plates
of
pure
gold
but
the
gold
is
scarcely
visible
from
the
variety
of
precious
stones
with
which
it
is
studded
such
as
sapphires
diamonds
rubies
and
emeralds
and
agates
jaspers
and
cornelians
set
in
relievo
some
of
the
cameos
being
of
such
a
size
that
i
do
not
dare
to
mention
it
but
everything
is
left
far
behind
by
a
ruby
not
larger
than
a
man

which
is
set
to
the
right
of
the
altar
they
say
that
it
was
the
gift
of
a
king
of
but
beside
these
shrines
of
reputation
no
hamlet
was
too
remote
to
possess
its
local
fetish
which
worked
at
cheap
rates
for
the
peasantry
a
curious
list
of
these
was
sent
to
the
government
by
two
of
cromwell
s
visitors
in
the
reign
of
henry
viii
the
nuns
of
saint
mary
at
derby

of

by
pregnant
women

was

girdle
of

at

a
pilgrimage
was
made
to
saint
guthlac
and
his
bell

was
put
on
the

a
great
venerator
of
the
eucharist
used
it
to
help
him
in
his
lectures
when
treating
of
the
dogma
of
the
supper
at
the
university
of
paris
many
questions
were
asked
him
which
he
never
answered
without
meditating
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
one
day
when
preparing
an
answer
to
a
very
difficult
question
he
placed
it
on
the
altar
and
cried
lord
who
really
and
veritably
dwells
in
the
holy
sacrament
hear
my
prayer
if
what
i
have
written
upon
your
divine
eucharist
be
true
let
it
be
given
me
to
teach
and
demonstrate
it
if
i
am
deceived
stop
me
from
proposing
doctrines
contrary
to
the
truth
of
your
divine
forthwith
the
lord
appeared
upon
the
altar
and
said
to
him
you
have
written
well
upon
the
sacrament
of
my
body
and
you
have
answered
the
question
which
has
been
proposed
to
you
as
well
as
human
intelligence
can
fathom
these
primitive
people
argue
directly
from
themselves
to
their
divinities
and
throughout
the
middle
ages
men
believed
that
envy
jealousy
and
vanity
were
as
rampant
in
heaven
as
on
earth
and
behaved
accordingly
the
root
of
the
monastic
movement
was
the
hope
of
obtaining
advantages
by
adulation
a
certain
clerk
who
had
more
confidence
in
the
mother
than
the
son
continually
repeated
the
ave
maria
as
his
only
prayer
one
day
while
so
engaged
christ
appeared
to
him
and
said
my
mother
thanks
you
very
much
for
your
salutations
et
me
salutare
to
insure
perpetual
intercession
it
was
necessary
that
the
song
of
praise
and
the
smoke
of
incense
should
be
perpetual
and
therefore
monks
and
nuns
worked
day
and
night
at
their
calling
as
a
bishop
of
metz
observed
when
wakened
one
freezing
morning
by
the
bell
of
saint
peter
of
bouillon
tolling
for
matins
neither
the
drowsiness
of
the
night
nor
the
bitterness
of
a
glacial
winter
kept
them
from
praising
the
creator
of
the
bequests
to
convents
were
in
the
nature
of
policies
of
insurance
in
favour
of
the
grantor
and
his
heirs
not
only
against
punishment
in
the
next
world
but
against
accident
in
this
on
this
point
doubt
is
impossible
for
the
belief
of
the
donor
is
set
forth
in
numberless
charters
cedric
de
guillac
in
a
deed
to
la
said
that
he
gave
because
as
water
extinguishes
fire
so
gifts
extinguish
and
an
anecdote
preserved
by
dugdale
shows
how
valuable
an
investment
against
accident
a
convent
was
thought
to
be
as
late
as
the
thirteenth
century
when
ralph
earl
of
chester
the
founder
of
the
monastery
of
dieulacres
was
returning
by
sea
from
the
holy
land
he
was
overtaken
one
night
by
a
sudden
tempest
how
long
is
it
till
midnight
he
asked
of
the
sailors
they
answered
about
two
he
said
to
them
work
on
till
midnight
and
i
trust
in
god
that
you
may
have
help
and
that
the
storm
will
when
it
was
near
midnight
the
captain
said
to
the
earl
my
lord
commend
yourself
to
god
for
the
tempest
increases
we
are
worn
out
and
are
in
mortal
then
earl
ralph
came
out
of
his
cabin
and
began
to
help
with
the
ropes
and
the
rest
of
the
ship
s
tackle
nor
was
it
long
before
the
storm
subsided
the
next
day
as
they
were
sailing
over
a
tranquil
sea
the
captain
said
to
the
earl
my
lord
tell
us
if
you
please
why
you
wished
us
to
work
till
the
middle
of
the
night
and
then
you
worked
harder
than
all
the
to
which
he
replied
because
at
midnight
my
monks
and
others
whom
my
ancestors
and
i
have
endowed
in
divers
places
rise
and
sing
divine
service
and
then
i
have
faith
in
their
prayers
and
i
believe
that
god
because
of
their
prayers
and
intercessions
gave
me
more
fortitude
than
i
had
before
and
made
the
storm
cease
as
i
philip
augustus
when
caught
in
a
gale
in
the
straits
of
messina
showed
equal
confidence
in
the
matins
of
clairvaux
and
was
also
rewarded
for
his
faith
by
good
weather
towards
morning
the
power
of
the
imagination
when
stimulated
by
the
mystery
which
in
an
age
of
decentralization
shrouds
the
operations
of
nature
can
be
measured
by
its
effect
in
creating
an
autocratic
class
of
between
the
sixth
and
the
thirteenth
centuries
about
of
the
soil
of
europe
passed
into
the
hands
of
religious
corporations
while
the
bulk
of
the
highest
talent
of
the
age
sought
its
outlet
through
monastic
life
the
force
operated
on
all
for
beside
religious
ecstasy
ambition
and
fear
were
at
work
and
led
to
results
inconceivable
when
centralization
has
begot
materialism
saint
bernard
s
position
was
more
conspicuous
and
splendid
than
that
of
any
monarch
of
his
generation
and
the
agony
of
terror
which
assailed
the
warriors
was
usually
proportionate
to
the
freedom
with
which
they
had
violated
ecclesiastical
commands
they
fled
to
the
cloister
for
protection
from
the
fiend
and
took
their
wealth
with
them
gérard
le
blanc
was
even
more
noted
for
his
cruelty
than
for
his
courage
he
was
returning
to
his
castle
one
day
after
having
committed
a
murder
when
he
saw
the
demon
whom
he
served
appear
to
claim
him
seized
with
horror
he
galloped
to
where
six
penitents
had
just
founded
the
convent
of
afflighem
and
supplicated
them
to
receive
him
the
news
spread
and
the
whole
province
gave
thanks
to
god
that
a
monster
of
cruelty
should
have
been
so
converted
a
few
days
after
his
example
was
followed
by
another
knight
equally
a
murderer
who
had
visited
the
recluses
and
touched
by
their
piety
and
austerity
resolved
to
renounce
his
patrimony
and
live
a
penitent
had
the
german
migrations
been
wars
of
extermination
as
they
have
sometimes
been
described
the
imagination
among
the
new
barbaric
population
might
have
been
so
stimulated
that
a
pure
theocracy
would
have
been
developed
between
the
time
of
saint
benedict
and
saint
bernard
but
the
barbarians
were
not
animated
by
hate
on
the
contrary
they
readily
amalgamated
with
the
old
population
amongst
whom
the
materialism
of
rome
lay
like
a
rock
in
a
rising
tide
sometimes
submerged
but
never
obliterated
the
obstacle
which
the
true
emotionalists
never
overcame
was
the
inheritance
of
a
secular
clergy
who
down
to
the
eleventh
century
were
generally
married
and
in
the
higher
grades
were
rather
barons
than
prelates
in
france
the
archbishop
of
rheims
the
bishops
of
beauvais
noyon
langres
and
others
were
counts
while
in
germany
the
archbishops
of
mayence
of
treves
and
of
cologne
were
princes
and
electors
standing
on
the
same
footing
as
the
dukes
of
saxony
and
bavaria
as
feudal
nobles
these
ecclesiastics
were
retainers
of
the
king
owed
feudal
service
led
their
vassals
in
war
and
some
of
the
fiercest
soldiers
of
the
middle
ages
were
clerks
milo
of
treves
was
a
famous
bishop
charles
martel
gave
the
archbishopric
of
rheims
to
a
warrior
named
milo
who
managed
also
to
obtain
the
see
of
treves
this
milo
was
the
son
of
basinus
the
last
incumbent
of
the
preferment
he
was
a
fierce
and
irreligious
soldier
and
was
finally
killed
hunting
but
during
the
forty
years
in
which
he
held
his
offices
boniface
with
all
the
aid
of
the
crown
and
the
pope
was
unable
to
prevail
against
him
and
in
pope
zachary
wrote
advising
that
he
should
be
left
to
the
divine
vengeance
such
a
system
was
incompatible
with
the
supremacy
of
a
theocracy
the
essence
of
a
theocracy
is
freedom
from
secular
control
and
this
craving
for
freedom
was
the
dominant
instinct
of
monasticism
saint
anselm
perhaps
the
most
perfect
specimen
of
a
monk
felt
it
in
the
marrow
of
his
bones
it
was
the
master
passion
of
his
life
and
he
insisted
upon
it
with
all
the
fire
of
his
nature
nihil

diligit
deus
in
hoc
mundo
quam
libertatem
ecclesiæ
suæ
liberam

deus
sponsam
suam
non
yet
only
very
slowly
as
the
empire
disintegrated
did
the
theocratic
idea
take
shape
as
late
as
the
ninth
century
the
pope
prostrated
himself
before
charlemagne
and
did
homage
as
to
a
roman
emperor
saint
benedict
founded
monte
cassino
in
but
centuries
elapsed
before
the
benedictine
order
rose
to
power
the
early
convents
were
isolated
and
feeble
and
much
at
the
mercy
of
the
laity
who
invaded
and
debauched
them
abbots
like
bishops
were
often
soldiers
who
lived
within
the
walls
with
their
wives
and
children
their
hawks
their
hounds
and
their
and
it
has
been
said
that
in
all
france
corbie
and
fleury
alone
kept
always
something
of
their
early
discipline
only
in
the
early
years
of
the
most
lurid
century
of
the
middle
ages
when
decentralization
culminated
and
the
imagination
began
to
gain
its
fullest
intensity
did
the
period
of
monastic
consolidation
open
with
the
foundation
of
cluny
in
william
of
aquitaine
drew
a
charter
which
so
far
as
possible
provided
for
the
complete
independence
of
his
new
corporation
there
was
no
episcopal
visitation
and
no
interference
with
the
election
of
the
abbot
the
monks
were
put
directly
under
the
protection
of
the
pope
who
was
made
their
sole
superior
john
xi
confirmed
this
charter
by
his
bull
of
and
authorized
the
affiliation
of
all
convents
who
wished
to
share
in
the
reform
the
growth
of
cluny
was
marvellous
by
the
twelfth
century
two
thousand
houses
obeyed
its
rule
and
its
wealth
was
so
great
and
its
buildings
so
vast
that
in
innocent
the
emperor
baldwin
and
saint
louis
were
all
lodged
together
within
its
walls
and
with
them
all
the
attendant
trains
of
prelates
and
nobles
with
their
servants
in
the
eleventh
century
no
other
force
of
equal
energy
existed
the
monks
were
the
most
opulent
the
ablest
and
the
best
organized
society
in
europe
and
their
effect
upon
mankind
was
proportioned
to
their
strength
they
intuitively
sought
autocratic
power
and
during
the
centuries
when
nature
favoured
them
they
passed
from
triumph
to
triumph
they
first
seized
upon
the
papacy
and
made
it
they
then
gave
battle
to
the
laity
for
the
possession
of
the
secular
hierarchy
which
had
been
under
temporal
control
since
the
very
foundation
of
the
church
about
the
year
rome
was
in
chaos
the
counts
of
tusculum
who
had
often
disposed
of
the
tiara
on
the
death
of
john
bought
it
for
benedict
ix
benedict
was
then
a
child
of
ten
but
he
grew
worse
as
he
grew
older
and
finally
he
fell
so
low
that
he
was
expelled
by
the
people
he
was
succeeded
by
sylvester
but
a
few
months
after
his
coronation
benedict
the
city
and
crowned
john
xx
with
his
own
hands
shortly
after
he
assaulted
the
vatican
and
then
three
popes
reigned
together
in
rome
in
this
crisis
gregory
vi
tried
to
restore
order
by
buying
the
papacy
for
himself
but
the
transaction
only
added
a
fourth
pope
to
the
three
already
consecrated
and
two
years
later
he
was
set
aside
by
the
emperor
henry
who
appointed
his
own
chancellor
in
his
place
it
was
a
last
triumph
for
the
laity
but
a
triumph
easier
to
win
than
to
sustain
when
the
soldier
created
the
high
priest
of
christendom
he
did
indeed
inspire
such
terror
that
no
man
in
the
great
assembly
dared
protest
but
in
nine
months
clement
was
dead
his
successor
lived
only
days
poisoned
as
it
was
rumoured
by
the
perfidious
italians
and
when
henry
sought
a
third
pope
among
his
prelates
he
met
with
general
timidity
to
accept
the
post
then
the
opportunity
of
the
monks
came
they
seized
it
and
with
unerring
instinct
fixed
themselves
upon
the
throne
from
which
they
have
never
been
expelled
according
to
the
picturesque
legend
bruno
bishop
of
toul
seduced
by
the
flattery
of
courtiers
and
the
allurements
of
ambition
accepted
the
tiara
from
the
emperor
and
set
out
upon
his
journey
to
italy
with
a
splendid
retinue
and
with
his
robe
and
crown
on
his
way
he
turned
aside
at
cluny
where
hildebrand
was
prior
hildebrand
filled
with
the
spirit
of
god
reproached
him
with
having
seized
upon
the
seat
of
the
vicar
of
christ
by
force
and
accepted
the
holy
office
from
the
sacrilegious
hand
of
a
layman
he
exhorted
bruno
to
cast
away
his
pomp
and
to
cross
the
alps
humbly
as
a
pilgrim
assuring
him
that
the
priests
and
people
of
rome
would
recognize
him
as
their
bishop
and
elect
him
according
to
canonical
forms
then
he
would
taste
the
joys
of
a
pure
conscience
having
entered
the
fold
of
christ
as
a
shepherd
and
not
as
a
robber
inspired
by
these
words
bruno
dismissed
his
train
and
left
the
convent
gate
as
a
pilgrim
he
walked
barefoot
and
when
after
two
months
of
pious
meditations
he
stood
before
saint
peter
s
he
spoke
to
the
people
and
told
them
it
was
their
privilege
to
elect
the
pope
and
since
he
had
come
unwillingly
he
would
return
again
were
he
not
their
choice
he
was
answered
with
acclamations
and
on
february
he
was
enthroned
as
leo
ix
his
first
act
was
to
make
hildebrand
his
minister
the
legend
tells
of
the
triumph
of
cluny
as
no
historical
facts
could
do
ten
years
later
in
the
reign
of
nicholas
the
theocracy
made
itself
through
the
assumption
of
the
election
of
the
pope
by
the
college
of
cardinals
and
in
hildebrand
the
incarnation
of
monasticism
was
crowned
under
the
name
of
gregory
vii
with
hildebrand
s
election
war
began
the
council
of
rome
held
in
decreed
that
holy
orders
should
not
be
recognized
where
investiture
had
been
granted
by
a
layman
and
that
princes
guilty
of
conferring
investiture
should
be
excommunicated
the
council
of
the
next
year
which
excommunicated
the
emperor
also
enunciated
the
famous
propositions
of
baronius
the
full
expression
of
the
theocratic
idea
that
the
roman
pontiff
alone
can
be
called
universal
that
he
alone
can
depose
or
reconcile
bishops
that
his
legate
though
of
inferior
rank
takes
precedence
of
all
bishops
in
council
and
can
pronounce
sentence
of
deposition
against
them
that
all
princes
should
kiss
the
pope
s
feet
alone
that
he
may
depose
emperors
that
his
judgments
can
be
overruled
by
none
and
he
alone
can
overrule
the
judgments
of
all
that
he
can
be
judged
by
no
one
that
the
roman
church
never
has
and
never
can
err
as
the
scriptures
testify
that
by
his
precept
and
permission
it
is
lawful
for
subjects
to
accuse
their
princes
that
he
is
able
to
absolve
from
their
allegiance
the
subjects
of
the
the
monks
had
won
the
papacy
but
the
emperor
still
held
his
secular
clergy
and
at
the
diet
of
worms
where
he
undertook
to
depose
hildebrand
he
was
sustained
by
his
prelates
without
a
moment
of
hesitation
the
enchanter
cast
his
spell
and
it
is
interesting
to
see
in
the
curse
which
he
launched
at
the
layman
how
the
head
of
monasticism
had
become
identified
with
the
spirit
which
he
served
the
priest
had
grown
to
be
a
god
on
earth
so
strong
in
this
confidence
for
the
honour
and
defence
of
your
church
on
behalf
of
the
omnipotent
god
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
by
your
power
and
authority
i
forbid
the
government
of
the
german
and
italian
kingdoms
to
king
henry
the
son
of
the
emperor
henry
who
with
arrogance
has
rebelled
against
your
church
i
absolve
all
christians
from
the
oaths
they
have
made
or
may
make
to
him
and
i
forbid
that
any
one
should
obey
him
as
henry
marched
on
italy
but
in
all
european
history
there
has
been
no
drama
more
tremendous
than
the
expiation
of
his
sacrilege
to
his
soldiers
the
world
was
a
vast
space
peopled
by
those
fantastic
beings
which
are
still
seen
on
gothic
towers
these
demons
obeyed
the
monk
of
rome
and
his
army
melting
from
the
emperor
under
a
nameless
horror
left
him
helpless
gregory
lay
like
a
magician
in
the
fortress
of
canossa
but
he
had
no
need
of
carnal
weapons
for
when
the
emperor
reached
the
alps
he
was
almost
alone
then
his
imagination
also
took
fire
the
panic
seized
him
and
he
sued
for
mercy
for
three
days
long
he
stood
barefoot
in
the
snow
at
the
castle
gate
and
when
at
last
he
was
admitted
and
benumbed
he
was
paralyzed
rather
by
terror
than
by
cold
then
the
great
miracle
was
wrought
by
which
god
was
made
to
publicly
judge
between
them
hildebrand
took
the
consecrated
wafer
and
broke
it
saying
to
the
suppliant
man
s
judgments
are
fallible
god
s
are
infallible
if
i
am
guilty

but
though
for
him
more
than

was
at

he
dared
not
taste
the

from
that
hour
his
fate
was
sealed
he
underwent
his
penance
and
received
absolution
and
when
he
had
escaped
from
the
terrible
old
man
he
renewed
the
war
but
the
spell
was
over
him
the
horror
clung
to
him
even
his
sons
betrayed
him
and
at
last
his
mind
gave
way
under
the
strain
and
he
abdicated

at

an
outcast
and
a
mendicant
and
for
five
long
years
his
body
lay
at
the
church
door
an
accursed
thing
which
no
man
dared
to
bury
such
was
the
evolution
of
the
mediæval
theocracy
the
result
of
that
social
disintegration
which
stimulates
the
human
imagination
and
makes
men
cower
before
the
unknown
the
force
which
caused
the
rise
of
an
independent
priesthood
was
the
equivalent
of
magic
and
it
was
the
waxing
of
this
force
through
the
dissolution
of
the
empire
of
the
west
which
made
the
schism
which
split
christendom
in
two
the
latin
church
divided
from
the
greek
because
it
was
the
reflection
of
the
imaginative
mind
while
the
west
grew
emotional
constantinople
stayed
the
centre
of
exchanges
the
seat
of
the
monied
class
and
when
cluny
captured
rome
the
antagonism
between
these
irreconcilable
instincts
precipitated
a
rupture
the
schism
dated
from
five
years
after
the
coronation
of
leo
nor
is
the
theory
new
it
was
explained
by
gibbon
long
ago
the
rising
majesty
of
rome
could
no
longer
brook
the
insolence
of
a
rebel
and
michael
cerularius
was
excommunicated
in
the
heart
of
constantinople
by
the
pope
s
legates
from
this
thunderbolt
we
may
date
the
consummation
of
the
schism
it
was
enlarged
by
each
ambitious
step
of
the
roman
pontiffs
the
emperors
blushed
and
trembled
at
the
ignominious
fate
of
their
royal
brethren
of
germany
and
the
people
were
scandalized
by
the
temporal
power
and
military
life
of
the
latin
chapter
iii
the
first
crusade
until
the
mechanical
arts
have
advanced
far
enough
to
cause
the
attack
in
war
to
predominate
over
the
defence
centralization
can
not
begin
for
when
a
mud
wall
can
stop
an
army
a
police
is
impossible
the
superiority
of
the
attack
was
the
secret
of
the
power
of
the
monied
class
who
controlled
rome
because
with
money
a
machine
could
be
maintained
which
made
individual
resistance
out
of
the
question
and
revolt
difficult
titus
had
hardly
more
trouble
in
reducing
jerusalem
and
dispersing
the
jews
than
a
modern
officer
would
have
under
similar
circumstances
as
the
barbarians
overran
the
roman
provinces
and
the
arts
declined
the
conditions
of
life
changed
the
defence
gained
steadily
on
the
attack
and
after
some
centuries
a
town
with
a
good
garrison
solid
ramparts
and
abundant
provisions
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
greatest
king
even
the
small
square
norman
tower
was
practically
impregnable
as
has
explained
these
towers
were
mere
passive
defences
formidable
to
a
besieger
only
because
no
machinery
existed
for
making
a
breach
in
a
wall
the
beleaguered
nobles
had
only
to
watch
their
own
men
see
to
their
doors
throw
projectiles
at
the
enemy
if
he
approached
too
near
if
mined
and
they
might
defy
a
great
army
until
their
food
failed
famine
was
the
enemy
most
feared
by
the
eleventh
century
these
towers
had
sprung
up
all
over
the
west
even
the
convents
and
churches
could
be
defended
and
every
such
stronghold
was
the
seat
of
a
count
or
baron
an
abbot
or
bishop
who
was
a
sovereign
because
no
one
could
coerce
him
and
who
therefore
exercised
all
the
rights
of
sovereignty
made
war
dispensed
justice
and
coined
money
in
france
alone
there
were
nearly
two
hundred
mints
in
the
twelfth
century
down
to
the
close
of
the
merovingian
dynasty
the
gold
standard
had
been
maintained
and
contraction
had
steadily
gone
on
but
for
reasons
which
are
not
understood
under
the
second
race
the
purchasing
power
of
bullion
temporarily
declined
and
this
expansion
was
probably
one
chief
cause
of
the
prosperity
of
the
reign
of
charlemagne
perhaps
the
relief
was
due
to
the
gradual
restoration
of
silver
to
circulation
for
the
coinage
was
then
reformed
and
the
establishment
of
the
silver
pound
as
the
measure
of
value
may
be
considered
as
the
basis
of
all
the
monetary
systems
of
modern
europe
the
interval
of
prosperity
was
however
brief
no
permanent
addition
was
made
to
the
stock
of
precious
metals
and
prices
continued
to
fall
as
is
demonstrated
by
the
rapid
deterioration
of
the
currency
in
this
second
period
of
relapse
disintegration
reached
its
limit
during
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
the
northmen
infested
the
coasts
of
france
and
sailed
up
the
rivers
burning
and
ravaging
as
far
as
rouen
and
orléans
even
the
convents
of
saint
martin
of
tours
and
saint
germain
des
près
were
sacked
the
mediterranean
swarmed
with
saracenic
corsairs
who
took
fraxinetum
near
toulon
seized
the
passes
of
the
alps
and
levied
toll
on
travel
into
italy
the
cannibalistic
huns
overran
the
lower
danube
and
closed
the
road
to
constantinople
western
europe
was
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
commerce
nearly
ceased
the
roads
were
so
bad
and
dangerous
and
the
sea
so
full
of
pirates
the
ancient
stock
of
scientific
knowledge
was
gradually
forgotten
and
the
imagination
had
full
play
upon
philosophy
the
effect
was
decisive
christianity
sank
to
a
plane
where
it
appealed
more
vividly
to
the
minds
of
the
surrounding
pagans
than
their
own
faiths
and
conversion
then
went
on
rapidly
in
rollo
of
normandy
was
baptized
the
danes
norwegians
poles
and
russians
followed
and
in
saint
stephen
ascended
the
throne
of
hungary
and
reopened
to
latin
christians
the
way
to
the
sepulchre
perhaps
the
destiny
of
modern
europe
has
hinged
upon
the
fact
that
the
christian
sacred
places
lay
in
asia
and
therefore
the
pilgrimage
brought
the
west
into
contact
with
the
east
but
the
pilgrimage
was
the
effect
of
and
the
vital
principle
of
monasticism
in
these
centuries
of
extreme
credulity
monasticism
had
its
strongest
growth
a
faculty
for
scientific
study
was
abnormal
and
experimental
knowledge
was
ascribed
to
sorcery
the
monk
gerbert
who
became
pope
as
sylvester
was
probably
the
most
remarkable
man
of
his
generation
though
poor
and
of
humble
birth
he
attracted
so
much
attention
that
he
was
sent
to
spain
where
he
studied
in
the
moorish
schools
at
barcelona
and
cordova
and
where
he
learned
the
rudiments
of
mathematics
and
geography
his
contemporaries
were
so
bewildered
by
his
knowledge
that
they
thought
it
due
to
magic
and
told
how
he
had
been
seen
flying
home
from
spain
borne
on
the
back
of
the
demon
he
served
and
loaded
with
the
books
he
had
stolen
from
the
wizard
his
master
sylvester
died
in
but
long
afterwards
anatomy
was
still
condemned
by
the
church
and
four
separate
councils
anathematized
experimental
medicine
because
it
threatened
to
destroy
the
value
of
the
shrines
the
ascendency
of
cluny
began
with
saint
hugh
who
was
chosen
abbot
in
the
year
leo
s
election
the
corporation
then
obtained
control
of
rome
and
in
another
years
was
engaged
in
its
desperate
struggle
with
the
remains
of
the
old
secular
police
power
but
though
hildebrand
crushed
henry
the
ancient
materialism
was
too
deeply
imbedded
to
be
eradicated
in
a
single
generation
and
meanwhile
the
imagination
had
been
brought
to
an
uncontrollable
intensity
a
new
and
fiercer
excitement
seethed
among
the
people
a
vision
of
the
conquest
of
talismans
so
powerful
as
to
make
their
owners
sure
of
heaven
and
absolute
on
earth
the
attraction
of
palestine
had
been
very
early
felt
for
in
a
had
been
written
called
the
from
bordeaux
to
which
gave
the
route
through
the
valley
of
the
danube
together
with
an
excellent
account
of
the
holy
land
in
those
days
before
the
barbaric
inroads
the
journey
was
safe
enough
but
afterwards
communication
nearly
ceased
and
when
stephen
was
baptized
in
the
relics
of
jerusalem
had
all
the
excitement
of
novelty
europe
glowed
with
enthusiasm
sylvester
proposed
a
crusade
and
hildebrand
declared
he
would
rather
risk
his
life
for
the
holy
places
than
rule
the
each
year
the
throngs
upon
the
road
increased
convents
sprang
up
along
the
way
to
shelter
the
pilgrims
the
whole
population
succoured
and
venerated
them
and
by
the
time
cluny
had
seized
the
triple
crown
they
left
in
veritable
armies
ingulf
secretary
to
william
the
conqueror
set
out
in
with
a
band
seven
thousand
strong
in
that
age
of
faith
no
such
mighty
stimulant
could
inflame
the
human
brain
as
a
march
to
jerusalem
a
crusade
was
no
vulgar
war
for
a
vulgar
prize
but
an
alliance
with
the
supernatural
for
the
conquest
of
talismans
whose
possession
was
tantamount
to
omnipotence
urban
s
words
at
clermont
when
he
first
preached
the
holy
war
have
lost
their
meaning
now
but
they
burned
like
fire
into
the
hearts
of
his
hearers
then
for
he
promised
them
glory
on
earth
and
felicity
in
heaven
and
he
spoke
in
substance
thus
no
longer
do
you
attack
a
castle
or
a
town
but
you
undertake
the
conquest
of
the
holy
places
if
you
triumph
the
blessings
of
heaven
and
the
kingdoms
of
the
east
will
be
your
share
if
you
fall
you
will
have
the
glory
of
dying
where
christ
died
and
god
will
not
forget
having
seen
you
in
his
holy
army
urban
told
them
that
under
their
general
jesus
christ
they
the
christian
the
invincible
army
would
march
to
certain
victory
in
the
eleventh
century
this
language
was
no
metaphor
for
the
cluniac
monk
spoke
as
the
mouthpiece
of
a
god
who
was
there
actually
among
them
offering
the
cross
he
brought
from
the
grave
and
promising
them
triumphs
not
the
common
triumphs
which
may
be
won
by
man
s
unaided
strength
but
the
transcendent
glory
which
belongs
to
beings
of
another
world
so
the
crusaders
rode
out
to
fight
the
originals
of
the
fairy
knights
clad
in
impenetrable
armour
mounted
on
miraculous
horses
armed
with
resistless
swords
and
bearing
charmed
lives
whole
villages
even
whole
districts
were
left
deserted
land
lost
its
value
what
could
not
be
sold
was
abandoned
and
the
peasant
loaded
with
his
poor
possessions
started
on
foot
with
his
wife
and
children
in
quest
of
the
sepulchre
so
ignorant
of
the
way
that
he
mistook
each
town
upon
the
road
for
zion
whether
he
would
or
no
the
noble
had
to
lead
his
vassals
or
be
forsaken
and
riding
at
their
head
with
his
hawks
and
hounds
he
journeyed
towards
that
marvellous
land
of
wealth
and
splendour
where
kingdoms
waited
the
coming
of
the
devoted
knight
of
god
thus
men
women
and
children
princes
and
serfs
priests
and
laymen
in
a
countless
motley
throng
surged
toward
that
mighty
cross
and
tomb
whose
possessor
was
raised
above
the
limitations
of
the
flesh
the
crusaders
had
no
commissariat
and
no
supply
train
no
engines
of
attack
or
other
weapons
than
those
in
their
hands
and
the
holy
relics
they
bore
with
them
there
was
no
general
no
common
language
no
organization
and
so
over
unknown
roads
and
through
hostile
peoples
they
wandered
from
the
rhine
to
the
bosphorus
and
from
the
bosphorus
to
syria
these
earlier
crusades
were
armed
migrations
not
military
invasions
and
had
they
met
with
a
determined
enemy
they
must
have
been
annihilated
but
it
chanced
that
the
syrians
and
egyptians
were
at
war
and
the
quarrel
was
so
bitter
that
the
caliph
actually
sought
the
christian
alliance
even
under
such
circumstances
the
waste
of
life
was
fabulous
and
had
not
antioch
been
betrayed
the
starving
rabble
must
have
perished
under
its
walls
at
jerusalem
also
the
franks
were
reduced
to
the
last
extremity
before
they
carried
the
town
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
arrival
of
a
corps
of
genoese
engineers
who
built
movable
towers
they
would
have
died
miserably
of
hunger
and
thirst
nor
was
the
coming
of
this
reinforcement
preconcerted
on
the
contrary
the
italians
accidentally
lost
their
ships
at
joppa
and
being
left
without
shelter
sought
protection
in
the
camp
of
the
besiegers
just
in
time
so
incapable
were
the
crusaders
of
regular
operations
that
even
when
the
towers
were
finished
and
armed
the
leaders
did
not
know
how
to
fill
the
moat
and
raymond
of
saint
gilles
had
nothing
better
to
propose
than
to
offer
a
penny
for
every
three
stones
thrown
into
the
ditch
on
july
jerusalem
was
stormed
almost
exactly
three
years
after
the
march
began
eight
days
later
godfrey
de
bouillon
was
elected
king
and
then
the
invaders
spread
out
over
the
strip
of
mountainous
country
which
borders
the
coast
of
palestine
and
syria
and
the
chiefs
built
castles
in
the
defiles
of
the
hills
and
bound
themselves
together
by
a
loose
alliance
against
the
common
enemy
the
decentralization
of
the
colony
was
almost
incredible
the
core
of
the
kingdom
was
the
barony
of
jerusalem
which
extended
only
from
the
egyptian
desert
to
a
stream
just
north
of
beyrout
and
inland
to
the
jordan
and
the
spurs
of
the
hills
beyond
the
dead
sea
and
yet
it
was
divided
into
more
than
eighteen
independent
fiefs
whose
lords
had
all
the
rights
of
sovereignty
made
war
administered
justice
and
coined
money
beside
these
petty
states
the
ports
were
ceded
to
the
italian
cities
whose
fleets
helped
in
the
conquest
venice
genoa
and
pisa
held
quarters
in
ascalon
joppa
tyre
acre
and
beyrout
which
were
governed
by
consuls
or
viscounts
who
wrangled
with
each
other
and
with
the
central
government
such
was
the
kingdom
over
which
godfrey
reigned
but
there
were
three
others
like
it
which
together
made
up
the
frankish
monarchy
to
the
north
of
the
barony
of
jerusalem
lay
the
county
of
tripoli
and
beyond
tripoli
extending
to
armenia
the
principality
of
antioch
to
the
east
of
antioch
the
county
of
edessa
stretched
along
the
base
of
the
taurus
mountains
and
spread
out
somewhat
indefinitely
beyond
the
euphrates
thus
on
the
north
edessa
was
the
outwork
of
christendom
while
to
the
south
the
castle
of
karak
which
commanded
the
caravan
road
between
suez
and
damascus
held
a
corresponding
position
among
the
hills
to
the
east
of
the
dead
sea
beyond
the
mountains
the
great
plain
sweeps
away
into
central
asia
and
in
this
plain
the
franks
never
could
maintain
their
footing
their
failure
to
do
so
proved
their
ruin
for
their
position
lay
exposed
to
attack
from
damascus
and
it
was
by
operating
from
damascus
as
a
base
that
saladin
succeeded
in
forcing
the
pass
of
banias
and
in
cutting
the
latin
possessions
in
two
at
the
battle
of
tiberias
a
considerable
body
of
europeans
were
thus
driven
in
like
a
wedge
between
egypt
and
the
greek
empire
the
two
highest
civilizations
of
the
middle
ages
while
in
front
lay
the
syrian
cities
of
the
plain
with
whom
the
christians
were
at
permanent
war
the
contact
was
the
closest
the
struggle
for
existence
the
sharpest
and
the
barbaric
mind
received
a
stimulus
not
unlike
the
impulse
gaul
received
from
rome
for
the
interval
which
separated
the
east
from
the
west
at
the
beginning
of
the
twelfth
century
was
probably
not
less
than
that
which
divided
italy
from
gaul
at
the
time
of
cæsar
when
godfrey
de
bouillon
took
the
cross
the
byzantine
empire
was
already
sinking
the
eastern
trade
which
for
so
many
centuries
had
nourished
its
population
was
beginning
to
flow
directly
from
asia
into
italy
and
as
the
economic
aristocracy
of
the
capital
lost
its
nutriment
it
lost
its
energy
apparently
it
fell
in
in
the
revolution
which
raised
alexius
comuenus
to
the
throne
because
alexius
sacked
constantinople
with
a
following
of
mongrel
greeks

in
reality
the
pure
greek

long
since
perished
the
byzantine
population
at
the
end
of
the
eleventh
century
was
the

of
a
multitude
of
races
a
mixture
of
slavs

jews
thracians
and
greeks
a
residuum
of
the
most
tenacious
organisms
after
all
that
was
higher
had
disappeared
the
army
was
a
mixed
horde
of
huns
arabs
italians
britons
franks
of
all
in
short
who
could
fight
and
were
for
sale
while
the
church
was
servile
the
fancy
dead
and
art
and
literature
were
redolent
of
decaying
wealth
nevertheless
ever
since
the
fall
of
rome
constantinople
had
been
the
reservoir
whence
the
west
had
drawn
all
its
materialistic
knowledge
and
therefore
it
was
during
the
centuries
when
the
valley
of
the
danube
was
closed
that
the
arts
fell
to
their
lowest
ebb

the
bosphorus
lay
once
more
in
the
path
of
travel
and
as
the
returning
palmers
spread
over
the
west
a
revival
followed
in
their
track
a
revival
in
which
the
spirit
of
byzantium
may
yet
be
clearly
read
in
the
architecture
of
italy
and
france
saint
mark
is
a
feeble
imitation
of
saint
sophia
while
has
described
how
long
he
hesitated
before
he
could
decide
whether
the
carving
of
vézelay
autun
and
moissac
was
greek
or
french
and
has
dwelt
upon
the
laborious
care
with
which
he
pored
over
all
the
material
before
he
became
convinced
that
the
stones
were
cut
by
artists
trained
at
cluny
who
copied
byzantine
models
but
the
great
gulf
between
the
economic
and
the
imaginative
development
separated
the
moribund
greek
society
from
the
of
the
franks
a
chasm
in
its
nature
impassable
because
caused
by
a
difference
of
mind
and
which
is
perhaps
seen
most
strikingly
in
religious
architecture
for
religious
architecture
though
always
embodying
the
highest
poetical
aspirations
of
every
civilization
yet
had
in
the
east
and
west
diametrically
opposite
points
of
departure
saint
sophia
is
pregnant
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
of
justinian
there
was
no
attempt
at
mystery
or
even
solemnity
about
the
church
for
the
mind
of
the
architect
was
evidently
fixed
upon
solving
the
problem
of
providing
the
largest
and
lightest
space
possible
in
which
to
display
the
functions
of
a
plutocratic
court
his
solution
was
brilliantly
successful
he
enlarged
the
dome
and
diminished
the
supports
until
nothing
remaining
to
interrupt
the
view
it
seemed
as
though
the
roof
had
been
suspended
in
the
air
for
his
purpose
the
exterior
had
little
value
and
he
sacrificed
it
the
conception
of
the
architects
of
france
was
the
converse
of
this
for
it
was
highly
emotional
the
gloom
of
the
lofty
vaults
dimly
lighted
by
the
subdued
splendour
of
the
coloured
windows
made
the
interior
of
the
gothic
cathedral
the
most
mysterious
and
exciting
sanctuary
for
the
celebration
of
the
miracle
which
has
ever
been
conceived
by
man
while
without
the
doors
and
windows
the
pinnacles
and
buttresses
were
covered
with
the
terrific
shapes
of
demons
and
the
majestic
figures
of
saints
admonishing
the
laity
of
the
danger
lurking
abroad
and
warning
them
to
take
refuge
within
but
if
the
greeks
and
the
franks
had
little
affinity
for
each
other
the
case
was
different
with
the
saracens
who
were
then
in
the
full
vigour
of
their
intellectual
prime
and
in
the
meridian
of
their
material
splendour
in
the
eleventh
century
when
paris
was
still
a
cluster
of
huts
cowering
for
shelter
on
the
islands
of
the
seine
and
the
palace
of
the
duke
of
normandy
and
king
of
england
was
the
paltry
white
tower
of
london
cairo
was
being
adorned
with
those
masterpieces
which
are
still
the
admiration
of
the
world
prisse

that
among
the
city
gates
the
stands
first
in
taste
and
style
and
the
famous
is
of
the
same
period
he
also
thought
the
mosque
of
teyloun
a
model
of
elegance
and
grandeur
and
observed
when
criticising
the
mosque
of
the
sultan
hassan
built
in
that
though
imposing
and
beautiful
it
lacks
the
unity
which
is
only
found
in
the
earlier
arabic
monuments
such
as
teyloun
indeed
the
signs
are
but
too
apparent
that
from
the
twelfth
century
the
instinct
for
form
began
to
fail
in
egypt
the
surest
precursor
of
artistic
decay
the
magnificence
of
the
decoration
and
furnishing
of
the
arabic
palaces
and
houses

seldom
been
surpassed
and
a
few
extracts
from
an

the

munk
was
of
opinion
that
arabic
philosophy
reached
its
apogee
with
averrhoës
who
was
born
about
certainly
he
was
the
last
of
a
famous
line
which
began
at
bagdad
three
centuries
earlier
and
hauréau
in
describing
the
great
period
of
saint
thomas
at
paris
dwelt
upon
the
debt
western
learning
owed
to
the
saracens
the
splendour
of
is
still
proverbial
the
tales
of
his
gold
and
silver
his
silks
and
gems
almost
surpass
belief
and
even
in
his
reign
the
mechanical
arts
were
so
advanced
that
he
sent
a
clock
to
charlemagne
humboldt
considered
the
arabs
as
the
founders
of
modern
experimental
science
and
they
were
relatively
skilful
chemists
for
they
understood
the
composition
of
sulphuric
and
nitric
acid
and
of
aqua
regia
beside
the
preparation
of
mercury
and
of
various
oxides
of

as
physicians
they
were
far
in
advance
of
europe
while
the
church
healed
by
miracles
and
put
experimental
methods
under
her
ban
the
famous
rhazes
conducted
the
hospitals
of

and
in
the
tenth
century
wrote
a
work
in

books
which
was
printed
at

as
late
as

though

sent
his

richard
never
thought
of
sending
an
englishman
to
saladin
when
afterwards
attacked
by
illness
even
as
late
as
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
little
advance
seems
to
have
been
made
in
europe
for
one
of
the
most
curious
phenomena
of
the
crusades
was
the
improvement
in
the
health
of
the
army
of
saint
louis
after
it
surrendered
during
the
campaign
various
epidemics
had
been
very
fatal
but
when
the
soldiers
were
subjected
to
the
sanitary
regulations
of
the
egyptian
medical
staff
disease
disappeared
the
arabs
had
a
strong
taste
for
mathematics
and
were
familiar
with
most
of
the
discoveries
which
have
been
attributed
to
astronomers
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
as
early
as
spherical
trigonometry
was
in
use
and
wrote
an
excellent
treatise
on
conic
sections
in
the
caliph
having
founded
observatories
at
bagdad
and
damascus
caused
a
degree
to
be
measured
on
the
plain
of
palmyra
by
the
thirteenth
century
the
arabic
instruments
were
comparatively
perfect
they
had
the
astrolabe
the
gnomon
the
sextant
and
the
mariner
s
compass
and
determined
the
third
lunar
variation
six
hundred
years
before
tycho
brahe
to
enumerate
all
the
improvements
in
agriculture
and
manufactures
which
came
from
the
mediæval
pilgrimage
would
take
a
separate
treatise
a
french
savant
thought
of
writing
a
book
upon
the
flora
of
the
crusades
alone
the
mulberry
and
the
silkworm
were
brought
from
greece
the
maize
from
turkey
the
plum
from
damascus
the
eschalot
from
ascalon
and
the
windmills
with
which
down
to
the
present
century
corn
was
ground
were
one
of
the
importations
from
the
levant
it
might
almost
be
said
that
all
the
west
knew
of
the
arts
was
learned
on
the
road
to
the
sepulchre
the
tyrians
taught
the
sicilians
to
refine
sugar
and
the
venetians
to
make
glass
damascus
steel
was
a
proverb
damascus
potters
were
the
masters
of
the
potters
of
france
the
silk
brocades
and
carpets
of
syria
and
persia
were
in
the
twelfth
century
what
they
have
been
down
to
the
present
day
at
once
the
admiration
and
despair
of
western
weavers
while
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
gunpowder
was
the
invention
of
the
chemists
of
the
east
all
the
evidence
tends
to
prove
that
the
ogive
came
from
the
levant
and
without
the
ogive
gothic
architecture
could
never
have
developed
prior
to
the
council
of
clermont
the
pointed
arch
was
practically
unknown
west
of
the
adriatic
but
the
arabs
had
long
used
it
and
it
may
still
be
seen
in
the
ninth
century
mosque
of
teyloun
in
palestine
the
franks
were
surrounded
by
saracenic
buildings
and
employed
saracenic
masons
and
the
attention
of
western
architects
seems
no
sooner
to
have
been
drawn
to
the
possibilities
of
the
ogive
than
they
saw
in
it
the
solution
of
those
problems
which
had
before
defied
them
an
arch
formed
by
two
intersecting
segments
of
a
circle
could
be
raised
to
any
height
from
any
base
and
was
perfectly
adapted
to
vaulting
the
parallelograms
formed
by
the
columns
of
the
nave
therefore
contemporaneously
with
the
building
of
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
the
period
of
transition
between
the
romanesque
and
the
gothic
opened
in
france
the
two
most
important
transition
buildings
were
the
abbey
of
saint
denis
and
the
cathedral
of
noyon
and
while
the
holy
sepulchre
was
dedicated
in
the
abbey
was
completed
in
and
the
cathedral
was
begun
almost
immediately
after
thenceforward
the
movement
was
rapid
and
before
the
year
christian
sacred
architecture
was
culminating
in
those
marvels
of
beauty
the
cathedrals
of
paris
of
bourges
of
chartres
and
of
le
alans
yet
though
sacred
architecture
tells
the
story
of
the
rise
of
the
imagination
as
nothing
else
can
if
it
be
true
that
centralization
hinges
on
the
preponderance
of
the
attack
in
war
the
surest
way
of
measuring
the
advance
toward
civilization
of
rude
peoples
must
be
by
military
engineering
in
the
eleventh
century
north
of
the
alps
this
science
was
rudimentary
and
nothing
can
be
more
impressive
than
to
compare
the
mighty
ramparts
of
constantinople
with
the
small
square
tower
which
william
the
conqueror
found
ample
for
his
needs
in
london
when
the
crusaders
were
first
confronted
with
the
greek
and
arabic
works
they
were
helpless
nor
were
their
difficulties
altogether
those
of
ignorance
such
fortifications
were
excessively
costly
and
a
feudal
state
was
poor
because
the
central
power
had
not
the
force
to
constrain
individuals
to
pay
taxes
the
kingdom
of
jerusalem
was
in
chronic
insolvency
the
life
of
the
latin
colony
in
syria
therefore
hung
on
the
development
of
some
financial
system
which
should
make
the
fortification
of
palestine
possible
and
such
a
system
grew
up
through
the
operation
of
the
imagination
though
in
an
unusual
manner
fetish
worship
drew
a
very
large
annual
contribution
from
the
population
in
the
shape
of
presents
to
propitiate
the
saints
and
one
of
the
effects
of
the
enthusiasm
for
the
crusades
was
to
build
up
conventual
societies
in
the
holy
land
which
acted
as
standing
armies
the
most
famous
of
the
military
orders
were
the
knights
of
the
temple
and
the
knights
of
saint
john
william
of
tyre
has
left
an
interesting
description
of
the
way
in
which
the
temple
came
to
be
organized
as
though
the
lord
god
sends
his
grace
there
where
he
pleases
worthy
knights
who
were
of
the
land
beyond
the
sea
proposed
to
stay
for
ever
in
the
service
of
our
lord
and
to
live
in
common
like
regular
canons
in
the
hand
of
the
patriarch
they
vowed
chastity
and
obedience
and
renounced
all
property
the
king
and
the
other
barons
the
patriarch
and
other
prelates
of
the
church
gave
them
funds
to
live
on
and
to
clothe
themselves
the
first
thing
which
was
enjoined
on
them
in
pardon
for
their
sins
was
to
guard
the
roads
by
which
the
pilgrims
passed
from
robbers
and
thieves
who
did
great
harm
this
penance
the
patriarch
and
the
other
bishops
enjoined
nine
years
they
remained
thus
in
secular
habit
wearing
such
garments
as
were
given
them
by
the
knights
and
other
good
people
for
the
love
of
god
in
the
ninth
a
council
was
assembled
in
france
in
the
city
of
troyes
there
were
assembled
the
archbishops
of
rheims
and
sens
and
all
their
bishops
the
bishop
of
albano
especially
was
there
as
papal
legate
the
abbots
of
citeau
and
clairvaux
and
many
other
of
the
religious
there
were
established
the
order
and
the
rules
by
which
they
were
to
live
as
monks
their
habit
was
ordered
to
be
white
by
the
authority
of
pope
honorius
and
the
patriarch
of
jerusalem
this
order
had
already
existed
nine
years
as
i
have
told
you
and
there
were
as
yet
only
nine
brothers
who
lived
from
day
to
day
on
charity
from
that
time
their
numbers
began
to
increase
and
revenues
and
tenures
were
given
them
in
the
time
of
pope
etigenius
it
was
ordered
that
they
should
have
sewn
upon
their
copes
and
on
their
robes
a
cross
of
red
cloth
so
that
they
should
be
known
among
all
men
from
thence
have
their
possessions
so
increased
as
you
can
see
that
the
order
of
the
temple
is
in
the
ascendant
hardly
can
you
find
on
either
side
of
the
sea
a
christian
land
where
this
order
has
not
houses
and
brethren
and
great
the
council
of
troyes
was
held
in
and
in
the
next
fifty
years
in
proportion
as
the
feudal
organization
of
the
latin
kingdom
decayed
the
military
orders
increased
in
wealth
and
power
the
hospital
held
nineteen
thousand
manors
in
europe
the
temple
nine
thousand
and
each
manor
could
maintain
a
knight
in
the
field
at
paris
the
house
of
the
temple
filled
a
whole
quarter
its
donjon
was
one
of
the
most
superb
buildings
of
the
middle
ages
at
a
later
period
when
the
corporation
took
to
banking
it
served
as
a
place
of
deposit
for
both
public
and
private
treasure
and
in
times
of
danger
the
king
himself
was
glad
to
take
shelter
within
its
walls
the
creation
of
this
monastic
standing
army
was
evidently
due
to
the
inferiority
of
the
attack
to
the
defence
which
made
the
civil
power
incapable
of
coercing
the
individual
who
refused
to
pay
taxes
the
petty
barons
who
built
the
castles
throughout
palestine
were
too
poor
to
erect
fortifications
capable
of
resisting
the
superior
engines
used
in
the
east
therefore
the
whole
burden
of
the
war
was
thrown
upon
the
church
and
in
all
modern
history
nothing
is
more
wonderful
than
the
way
in
which
this
work
was
done
within
fifty
years
after
the
conquest
the
feudal
machinery
was
in
ruin
and
the
strategic
points
one
after
another
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
strongest
force
of
the
age
the
force
which
was
incarnate
imagination
the
fortresses
built
by
the
monks
were
the
ramparts
of
christendom
and
among
the
remains
which
have
survived
the
past
perhaps
none
are
more
impressive
than
the
huge
castles
of
the
crusaders
in
the
gorges
of
the
syrian
mountains
nor
do
any
show
so
clearly
whence
came
the
rationalistic
stimulus
which
revolutionized
europe
shattered
the
church
and
brought
in
the
economic
society
which
has
ruled
europe
since
the
templars
passed
away
miles
due
west
of
homs
at
the
point
where
the
lebanon
melts
into
the
ansarieh
range
the
mountains
open
and
two
passes
lead
by
easy
descents
to
the
sea
through
the
southern
runs
the
road
to
tripoli
through
the
northern
that
to
tortosa
between
them
on
a
crag
a
thousand
feet
above
the
valleys
still
stands
the
castle
of
the
krak
des
chevaliers
ceded
by
count
raymond
of
tripoli
to
the
hospital
in
towering
above
the
plain
it
can
be
seen
for
miles
and
no
description
can
give
an
idea
of
its
gigantic
size
and
power
coucy
and
pierrefonds
are
among
the
largest
fortresses
of
europe
and
yet
coucy
and
pierrefonds
combined
are
no
larger
than
the
krak
compared
with
it
the
works
then
built
in
the
west
were
toys
and
the
engineering
talent
shown
in
its
conception
was
equalled
by
the
magnificence
of
its
masonry
the
byzantine
system
was
adopted
a
double
wall
the
inner
commanding
the
outer
with
a
moat
between
and
three
enormous
towers
rising
from
the
moat
formed
the
donjon
there
were
stone
machicoulis
and
all
the
refinements
of
defence
which
appeared
in
france
under
saint
louis
and
his
son
and
a
study
of
this
stupendous
monument
shows
plainly
whence
europeans
drew
their
military
instruction
for
a
century
to
come
the
krak
was
the
outwork
dominating
the
plain
where
the
christians
never
made
their
footing
good
and
stood
at
the
apex
of
a
triangle
of
fortresses
as
remarkable
as
itself
from
its
ramparts
the
great
white
tower
of
can
be
seen
midway
between
the
outpost
commanding
the
mountain
passes
and
the
base
upon
the
sea
held
by
the
temple
and
from
that
tower
the
troop
of
templars
rode
to
relieve
the
knights
of
saint
john
on
the
day
when
the
crusaders
routed
the
conqueror
and
cut
his
army
to
pieces
as
it
fled
toward
the
lake
of
homs
which
lies
in
the
distance
but
the
white
tower
is
unlike
the
donjons
of
other
lands
and
bears
the
imprint
of
the
force
which
built
it
for
it
is
not
a
layman
s
hold
but
a
church
whose
windows
are
cut
in
walls
thirteen
feet
thick
whence
the
dim
light
falls
across
the
altar
where
the
magicians
wrought
their
miracles
within
easy
supporting
distance
lay
tortosa
a
walled
town
the
outwork
of
a
donjon
at
least
as
strong
as
the
krak
and
built
with
a
perfection
of
workmanship
and
a
beauty
of
masonry
which
proves
at
once
the
knowledge
and
the
resources
of
the
order
no
monarch
of
the
west
could
probably
at
that
time
have
undertaken
so
costly
an
enterprise
and
yet
tortosa
was
but
one
of
four
vast
structures
which
lie
within
a
few
miles
of
each
other
the
place
was
ceded
to
the
temple
in
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
philip
augustus
before
men
dreamed
of
the
more
important
french
fortifications
at
margat
a
day
s
journey
to
the
north
the
hospital
had
their
base
upon
the
sea
a
stronghold
whose
cost
must
have
been
fabulous
for
it
is
perched
upon
a
crag
high
above
the
mediterranean
and
so
inaccessible
that
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
how
the
materials
for
building
were
collected
who
was
lost
in
admiration
at
coucy
declared
that
it
was
colossal
enough
to
befit
a
race
of
giants
and
yet
coucy
could
have
stood
in
the
courtyard
of
margat
the
arabs
who
were
excellent
engineers
deemed
it
a
masterpiece
and
the
sultan
kalaoun
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
injuring
it
after
he
had
mined
the
great
tower
and
was
sure
of
victory
he
proved
to
the
garrison
his
power
to
destroy
it
in
order
to
induce
them
to
accept
most
liberal
terms
of
surrender
and
let
him
have
the
prize
perhaps
the
best
description
ever
given
of
the
work
is
in
a
letter
written
by
the
sultan
of
hamah
to
his
vizier
to
announce
its
fall
the
devil
himself
had
taken
pleasure
in
consolidating
its
foundations

many
times
have
the
mussulmans
tried
to
reach

precipices
markab

alone
can
fly
to
its
chapter
iv
the
second
crusade
as
the
east
was
richer
than
the
west
the
saracens
were
capable
of
a
higher
centralization
than
the
franks
and
although
they
were
divided
amongst
themselves
at
the
close
of
the
eleventh
century
no
long
time
elapsed
after
the
fall
of
jerusalem
before
the
consolidation
began
which
annihilated
the
latin
kingdom
the
sultan
of
persia
made
zenghi
governor
of
mosul
in
zenghi
who
was
the
first
atabek
was
a
commander
and
organizer
of
ability
and
with
a
soldier
s
instinct
struck
where
his
enemy
was
vulnerable
he
first
occupied
aleppo
hamah
and
homs
he
then
achieved
the
triumph
of
his
life
by
the
capture
of
edessa
the
next
year
he
was
murdered
and
was
succeeded
by
his
still
more
celebrated
son
who
made
aleppo
his
capital
and
devoted
his
life
to
completing
the
work
his
father
had
begun
after
a
series
of
brilliant
campaigns
by
a
mixture
of
vigour
and
address
made
himself
master
of
damascus
and
operating
thence
as
a
base
he
conquered
egypt
and
occupied
cairo
in
during
the
egyptian
war
a
young
emir
named
saladin
rose
rapidly
into
prominence
he
was
the
nephew
of
the
general
in
command
at
whose
death
the
caliph
made
him
vizier
because
he
thought
him
pliable
in
this
the
caliph
was
mistaken
for
saladin
was
a
man
of
iron
will
and
consummate
ability
william
of
tyre
even
accused
him
of
having
murdered
the
last
fatimite
caliph
with
his
own
hands
in
order
to
cause
the
succession
to
pass
to
and
to
seize
on
the
substance
of
power
himself
as
s
representative
certainly
he
administered
egypt
in
his
own
interest
and
not
in
his
master
s
so
much
so
that
having
failed
to
obtain
obedience
to
his
commands
had
prepared
to
march
against
him
in
person
when
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
he
died
saladin
then
moved
on
damascus
and
having
defeated
the
army
of
el
melek
the
heir
to
the
crown
at
hamah
he
had
himself
declared
sultan
of
egypt
and
syria
with
a
power
so
centralized
the
franks
would
probably
under
the
best
circumstances
have
been
unable
to
cope
the
weakness
of
the
christians
was
radical
and
arose
from
the
exuberance
of
their
imagination
which
caused
them
to
proceed
by
miracles
or
more
correctly
by
magical
formulas
an
exalted
imagination
was
the
basis
of
the
characters
of
both
louis
vii
and
saint
bernard
and
the
faith
resulting
therefrom
led
to
the
defeat
of
the
second
crusade
the
christian
collapse
began
with
the
fall
of
edessa
for
the
county
of
edessa
was
the
extreme
northeastern
state
of
the
latin
community
and
the
key
to
the
cities
of
the
plain
when
the
first
crusaders
reached
armenia
baldwin
brother
of
godfrey
de
bouillon
conceived
the
idea
of
carving
a
kingdom
for
himself
out
of
the
christian
country
to
the
south
of
the
taurus
range
taking
with
him
such
pilgrims
as
he
could
persuade
to
go
he
started
from
mamistra
just
north
of
the
modern
alexandretta
and
marched
east
along
the
caravan
road
edessa
lay
sixteen
hours
ride
beyond
the
euphrates
and
he
reached
it
in
safety
at
this
time
though
edessa
still
nominally
formed
part
of
the
greek
empire
it
was
in
reality
independent
and
was
governed
by
an
old
man
named
theodore
who
had
originally
been
sent
from
constantinople
but
who
had
gradually
taken
the
position
of
a
sovereign
the
surrounding
country
had
been
overrun
by
moslems
and
theodore
only
maintained
himself
by
paying
tribute
the
people
therefore
were
ready
to
welcome
any
frankish
baron
capable
of
defending
them
and
baldwin
though
a
needy
adventurer
was
an
excellent
officer
and
well
adapted
to
the
emergency
as
he
drew
near
the
townsmen
went
out
to
meet
him
and
escorted
him
to
the
city
in
triumph
where
he
soon
supplanted
the
old
theodore
whom
he
probably
murdered
he
then
became
count
of
edessa
but
he
remained
in
the
country
only
two
years
for
in
he
was
elected
to
succeed
his
brother
godfrey
he
was
followed
as
lord
of
edessa
by
his
cousin
godfrey
de
bourg
who
in
his
turn
was
crowned
king
of
jerusalem
in
and
the
next
count
was
de
bourg
s
cousin
joscelin
de
courtney
who
had
previously
held
as
a
fief
the
territory
to
the
west
of
the
euphrates
this
joscelin
was
one
of
the
most
renowned
warriors
who
ever
came
from
france
and
while
he
lived
the
frontier
was
well
defended
so
high
was
his
prowess
that
he
earned
the
title
of
the
great
in
an
age
when
every
man
was
a
soldier
and
in
a
country
where
arms
were
the
only
path
to
fortune
save
the
church
the
story
of
his
death
is
one
of
the
most
dramatic
of
that
dramatic
time
as
he
stood
beneath
the
wall
of
a
saracenic
tower
he
had
mined
it
suddenly
fell
and
buried
him
in
the
ruins
he
was
taken
out
a
mangled
mass
to
die
but
as
he
lay
languishing
news
came
that
the
sultan
of
iconium
had
laid
siege
to
one
of
his
castles
near
tripoli
feeling
that
he
could
not
sit
his
horse
he
called
his
son
and
directed
him
to
collect
his
vassals
and
ride
to
the
relief
of
the
fortress
the
youth
hesitated
fearing
that
the
enemy
were
too
numerous
then
the
old
man
grieving
to
think
of
the
fate
of
his
people
when
he
should
be
gone
had
himself
slung
in
a
litter
between
two
horses
and
marched
against
the
foe
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
was
met
by
a
messenger
who
told
him
that
when
the
saracens
heard
the
lord
of
courtney
was
upon
the
march
they
had
raised
the
siege
and
fled
then
the
wounded
baron
ordered
his
litter
to
be
set
down
upon
the
ground
and
stretching
out
his
hands
to
heaven
he
thanked
god
who
had
so
honoured
him
that
his
enemies
dared
not
abide
his
coming
even
when
in
the
jaws
of
death
and
died
there
where
he
lay
the
second
generation
of
franks
seems
to
have
deteriorated
through
the
influence
of
the
climate
but
the
character
of
the
younger
joscelin
was
not
the
sole
cause
of
the
disasters
which
overtook
him
probably
even
his
father
could
not
permanently
have
made
head
against
the
forces
which
were
combining
against
him
the
weakness
of
the
frankish
kingdom
was
inherent
it
could
not
contend
with
enemies
who
were
further
advanced
upon
the
road
toward
consolidation
had
western
society
been
enough
centralized
to
have
organized
a
force
capable
of
collecting
taxes
and
of
enforcing
obedience
to
a
central
administration
a
army
might
have
been
maintained
on
the
frontier
as
it
was
concentration
was
impossible
and
the
scattered
nobles
were
crushed
in
detail
antioch
was
the
nearest
supporting
point
to
edessa
and
when
zenghi
made
his
attack
raymond
de
poitiers
one
of
the
ablest
soldiers
of
his
generation
was
the
reigning
prince
but
he
was
at
feud
with
the
courtneys
the
king
at
jerusalem
could
not
force
him
to
do
his
duty
the
other
barons
were
too
distant
even
had
they
been
well
disposed
and
thus
the
key
to
the
christian
position
fell
without
a
blow
being
struck
in
its
defence
to
that
emotional
generation
the
loss
of
edessa
seemed
a
reversal
of
the
laws
of
nature
a
consequence
not
of
bad
organization
but
of
divine
wrath
the
invincible
relics
had
suddenly
refused
to
act
and
the
only
explanation
which
occurred
to
the
men
of
the
time
was
that
there
must
have
been
neglect
of
the
magical
formulas
saint
bernard
never
doubted
that
god
would
fight
if
duly
propitiated
therefore
all
else
must
bend
to
the
task
of
propitiation
what
think
ye
brethren
is
the
hand
of
the
lord
weakened
or
unequal
to
the
work
of
defence
that
he
calls
miserable
worms
to
guard
and
restore
his
heritage
is
he
not
able
to
send
more
than
twelve
legions
of
angels
or
to
speak
truly
by
word
deliver
his
country
saint
bernard
of
clairvaux
the
soul
of
the
second
crusade
was
born
at
the
castle
of
fontaines
near
dijon
in
so
that
his
earliest
impressions
must
have
been
tinged
by
the
emotional
outburst
which
followed
the
council
of
clermont
the
third
son
of
noble
parents
he
resembled
his
mother
who
had
the
ecstatic
temperament
while
she
lived
she
tried
to
imitate
the
nuns
and
at
her
death
she
was
surrounded
by
holy
clerks
who
sung
with
her
while
she
could
speak
and
when
articulation
failed
watched
her
lips
moving
in
praise
to
god
from
the
outset
bernard
craved
a
monastic
life
and
when
he
grew
up
insisted
on
dedicating
himself
to
heaven
his
first
success
was
the
conversion
of
his
brothers
whom
he
carried
with
him
to
the
cloister
with
the
exception
of
the
youngest
who
was
then
a
child
as
the
brothers
passed
through
the
castle
courtyard
on
their
way
to
the
convent
guy
the
eldest
said
to
the
boy
who
was
playing
there
with
other
children
well
nivard
all
our
land
is
now
so
you
will
have
heaven
and
i
earth
the
child
answered
that
is
an
unequal
and
a
few
years
after
he
joined
his
brothers
the
father
and
one
daughter
then
were
left
alone
and
at
last
they
too
entered
convents
where
they
died
at
when
bernard
took
his
vows
at
citeaux
his
influence
was
so
strong
that
he
carried
with
him
thirty
of
his
comrades
and
mothers
are
said
to
have
hid
their
sons
from
him
and
wives
their
husbands
lest
he
should
lure
them
away
he
actually
broke
up
so
many
homes
that
the
abandoned
wives
formed
a
nunnery
which
afterward
grew
rich
his
abilities
were
so
marked
that
his
superiors
singled
him
out
when
he
had
hardly
finished
his
novitiate
to
found
a
house
in
the
wilderness
this
house
became
clairvaux
in
the
twelfth
century
the
most
famous
monastery
of
the
world
in
the
middle
ages
convents
were
little
patronized
until
by
some
miracle
they
had
proved
themselves
worthy
of
hire
their
early
years
were
often
passed
in
poverty
and
clairvaux
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
for
the
brethren
suffered
privations
which
nearly
caused
revolt
in
the
midst
of
his
difficulties
bernard
s
brother
gérard
who
was
cellarer
came
to
him
to
complain
that
the
fraternity
were
without
the
barest
necessities
of
life
the
man
of
god
asked
how
much
will
suffice
for
present
wants
gérard
replied
twelve
bernard
dismissed
him
and
betook
himself
to
prayer
soon
after
gérard
returned
and
announced
that
a
woman
was
without
and
wished
to
speak
with
him
she
when
he
had
come
to
her
prostrating
herself
at
his
feet
offered
him
a
gift
of
twelve
pounds
imploring
the
aid
of
his
prayers
for
her
husband
who
was
dangerously
sick
having
briefly
spoken
with
her
he
dismissed
her
saying
go
you
will
find
your
husband
she
going
home
found
what
she
had
heard
had
come
to
pass
the
abbot
comforting
the
weakness
of
his
cellarer
made
him
stronger
for
bearing
other
trials
from
although
his
family
were
somewhat
sceptical
about
his
gifts
and
even
teased
him
to
tears
the
monk
william
tells
in
his
chronicle
how
he
soon
performed
an
astounding
miracle
which
made
clairvaux
a
veritable
valley
of
light
and
then
wealth
poured
in
upon
him
meanwhile
his
constitution
which
had
never
been
vigorous
had
been
so
impaired
by
his
penances
that
he
was
unable
to
follow
the
monastic
life
in
its
full
rigour
and
he
therefore
threw
himself
into
politics
to
which
he
was
led
both
by
taste
and
by
the
current
of
events
clairvaux
was
founded
in
and
fifteen
years
later
bernard
had
risen
high
in
his
profession
the
in
his
life
was
the
part
he
took
in
the
recognition
of
innocent
ii
in
honorius
ii
died
and
two
popes
were
chosen
by
the
college
of
cardinals
anacletus
and
innocent
ii
anacletus
stayed
in
rome
but
innocent
crossed
the
alps
and
a
council
was
summoned
at
étampes
to
decide
upon
his
title
by
a
unanimous
vote
the
question
was
referred
to
bernard
and
his
biographer
described
how
he
examined
the
evidence
with
fear
and
trembling
and
how
at
last
the
holy
ghost
spoke
through
his
mouth
and
he
recognized
innocent
his
decision
was
ratified
and
soon
after
he
managed
to
obtain
the
adhesion
of
the
king
of
england
to
the
new
pontiff
his
success
made
him
the
foremost
man
in
europe
and
when
in
one
of
his
monks
was
raised
to
the
papacy
as
eugenius
he
wrote
with
truth
i
am
said
to
be
more
pope
than
perhaps
no
one
ever
lived
more
highly
gifted
with
the
ecstatic
temperament
than
saint
bernard
he
had
the
mysterious
attribute
of
miracles
and
in
the
twelfth
century
the
miracle
was
perhaps
the
highest
expression
of
force
to
work
them
was
a
personal
gift
and
the
possessor
of
the
faculty
might
at
his
caprice
use
his
power
like
the
sorcerer
to
aid
or
injure
other
men
one
day
as
saint
bernard
was
on
his
way
to
a
field
at
harvest
time
the
monk
who
drove
the
donkey
on
which
he
rode
fell
in
an
epileptic
fit
seeing
which
the
holy
man
had
pity
on
him
and
entreated
god
that
for
the
future
he
would
not
seize
him
accordingly
from
that
day
until
his
death
twenty
years
after
whenever
he
was
to
fall
from
that
disease
he
felt
the
fit
coming
for
a
certain
space
of
time
so
that
he
had
an
opportunity
to
lie
down
on
a
bed
and
so
avert
the
bruises
of
a
sudden
this
cure
was
a
pure
act
of
grace
like
alms
made
to
gratify
the
whim
of
the
saint
and
a
man
who
could
so
control
nature
was
more
powerful
than
any
other
on
earth
bernard
was
such
a
man
and
for
this
reason
he
was
chosen
by
acclamation
to
preach
the
second
crusade
his
sermons
have
perished
but
two
of
his
letters
have
survived
and
they
explain
the
essential
weakness
of
a
military
force
raised
on
the
basis
of
supernatural
intervention
he
looked
upon
the
approaching
campaign
as
merely
the
vehicle
for
a
miracle
and
as
devised
to
offer
to
those
who
entered
on
it
a
special
chance
for
salvation
therefore
he
appealed
to
the
criminal
classes
for
what
is
it
but
an
exquisite
and
priceless
chance
of
salvation
due
to
god
alone
that
the
omnipotent
should
deign
to
summon
to
his
service
as
though
they
were
innocent
murderers
ravishers
adulterers
perjurers
and
those
guilty
of
every
crime
even
had
an
army
composed
of
such
material
been
well
disciplined
and
well
led
it
would
have
been
untrustworthy
in
the
face
of
an
adversary
like
but
louis
vii
of
france
was
as
emotional
and
as
irrational
as
saint
bernard
his
father
had
been
a
great
commander
but
he
himself
had
been
educated
in
the
abbey
of
saint
denis
and
justified
his
wife
s
scornful
jest
who
when
she
left
him
for
raymond
de
poitiers
said
she
had
married
a
monk
the
whole
world
held
him
lightly
even
the
priests
sneered
at
him
and
innocent
ii
spoke
of
him
as
a
child
who
must
be
stopped
from
learning
indeed
the
pope
underrated
him
for
he
appointed
his
own
nephew
to
the
see
of
bourges
in
defiance
of
the
king
and
the
insult
roused
him
to
resistance
louis
raised
an
army
and
invaded
the
county
of
champagne
where
the
bishop
had
taken
refuge
there
he
stormed
and
burnt
vitry
and
some
thirteen
hundred
men
women
and
children
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
church
perished
in
the
flames
of
the
blazing
town
horror
seems
to
have
unhinged
his
mind
absolution
did
not
calm
him
and
at
last
he
came
to
believe
that
his
only
hope
of
salvation
lay
in
a
pilgrimage
to
the
sepulchre
on
palm
sunday
when
bernard
harangued
a
vast
throng
at
vézelay
the
king
was
the
first
to
prostrate
himself
and
take
the
cross
from
his
hands
with
that
day
began
the
most
marvellous
part
of
the
saint
s
marvellous
career
and
were
the
events
which
followed
less
well
authenticated
they
would
be
incredible
in
that
age
miracles
were
as
common
as
medical
cures
are
now
and
yet
bernard
s
performances
so
astonished
his
contemporaries
that
they
drew
up
a
solemnly
attested
record
of
what
they
saw
that
the
story
of
his
preaching
might
never
be
questioned
when
he
neared
a
town
the
bells
were
rung
and
young
and
old
from
far
and
near
thronged
about
him
in
crowds
so
dense
that
at
constance
no
one
saw
what
passed
because
no
one
dared
to
venture
into
the
press
at
troyes
he
was
in
danger
of
being
suffocated
elsewhere
the
sick
were
brought
to
him
by
a
ladder
as
he
stood
at
a
window
out
of
reach
what
he
did
may
be
judged
by
the
work
of
a
single
day
when
the
holy
man
entered
germany
he
shone
so
marvellously
by
cures
that
it
can
neither
be
told
in
words
nor
would
it
be
believed
if
it
were
told
for
those
testify
who
were
present
in
the
country
of
constance
near
the
town
of
doningen
who
diligently
investigated
these
things
and
saw
them
with
their
eyes
that
in
one
day
eleven
blind
received
their
sight
by
the
laying
on
of
his
hands
ten
maimed
were
restored
and
eighteen
lame
made
thus
literally
by
thousands
the
blind
saw
the
lame
walked
the
maimed
were
made
whole
he
cast
out
devils
turned
water
into
wine
raised
the
dead
but
no
modern
description
can
give
an
idea
of
the
paroxysm
of
excitement
the
stories
must
be
read
in
the
chronicles
themselves
yet
strangely
enough
such
was
the
strength
of
the
materialistic
inheritance
from
the
empire
that
bernard
does
not
always
seem
fully
to
have
believed
in
himself
he
was
tinged
with
some
shade
of
scepticism
the
meeting
at
vézelay
was
held
on
march
four
weeks
later
on
april
at
a
council
held
at
chartres
the
command
of
the
army
to
invade
palestine
was
offered
to
the
abbot
of
clairvaux
had
the
saint
thoroughly
believed
in
himself
and
his
twelve
legions
of
angels
he
would
not
have
hesitated
for
no
enemy
could
have
withstood
god
in
fact
he
was
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
pope
which
might
befit
a
modern
clergyman
after
explaining
that
he
had
been
chosen
commander
against
his
will
he
exclaimed
who
am
i
that
i
should
set
camps
in
order
or
should
march
before
armed
men
or
what
is
so
remote
from
my
profession
even
had
i
the
strength
and
the
knowledge
were
not
lacking
i
beseech
you
by
that
charity
you
especially
owe
me
that
you
do
not
abandon
me
to
the
wills
of
during
and
two
vast
mixed
multitudes
swarming
with
criminals
and
women
gathered
at
metz
and
ratisbon
as
a
fighting
force
these
hosts
were
decidedly
inferior
to
the
bands
which
had
left
europe
fifty
years
before
under
tancred
and
godfrey
de
bouillon
and
they
were
besides
commanded
by
the
king
of
france
the
germans
can
not
be
considered
as
having
taken
any
part
in
the
war
for
they
perished
without
having
struck
a
blow
the
greek
emperor
caused
them
to
be
lured
into
the
mountains
of
asia
minor
where
they
were
abandoned
by
their
guides
and
wasted
away
from
exposure
hunger
and
thirst
until
the
saracens
destroyed
them
without
allowing
them
to
come
to
battle
the
french
fared
little
better
in
crossing
the
cadmus
mountains
their
lack
of
discipline
occasioned
a
defeat
which
made
william
of
tyre
wonder
at
the
ways
of
god
to
no
one
should
the
things
done
by
our
lord
be
displeasing
for
all
his
works
are
right
and
good
but
according
to
the
judgment
of
men
it
was
marvellous
how
our
lord
permitted
the
franks
who
are
the
people
in
the
world
who
believe
in
him
and
honour
him
most
to
be
thus
destroyed
by
the
enemies
of
the
soon
after
this
check
louis
was
joined
by
the
grand
master
of
the
temple
under
whose
guidance
he
reached
atalia
a
greek
port
in
pamphylia
and
here
had
the
king
been
a
rationalist
he
would
have
stormed
the
town
and
used
it
as
a
base
of
operations
against
syria
in
the
eyes
of
laymen
the
undisguised
hostility
of
the
emperor
would
have
fully
justified
such
an
attack
but
louis
was
a
devotee
bound
by
a
vow
to
the
performance
of
a
certain
mystic
formula
and
one
part
of
his
vow
was
not
to
attack
christians
during
his
pilgrimage
in
his
mind
the
danger
of
disaster
from
supernatural
displeasure
was
greater
than
the
strategic
advantage
and
so
he
allowed
his
army
to
rot
before
the
walls
in
the
dead
of
winter
without
tents
or
supplies
until
it
wasted
to
a
shadow
of
its
former
strength
finally
the
governor
contracted
to
provide
shipping
but
he
delayed
for
another
five
weeks
and
when
the
transports
came
they
were
too
few
even
then
louis
would
not
strike
but
abandoning
the
poor
and
sick
to
their
fate
he
sailed
away
with
the
flower
of
his
troops
and
by
spring
the
corpses
of
those
whom
he
had
deserted
bred
a
pestilence
which
depopulated
the
city
when
he
arrived
at
antioch
new
humiliations
and
disasters
awaited
him
raymond
de
poitiers
was
one
of
the
handsomest
and
most
gifted
men
of
this
time
affable
courteous
brave
and
sagacious
in
many
respects
a
great
captain
his
failing
was
a
hot
temper
which
led
him
to
his
ruin
he
forsook
joscelin
through
jealousy
and
the
fall
of
edessa
cost
him
throne
and
life
after
the
successes
of
zenghi
a
very
short
experience
of
sufficed
to
convince
prince
raymond
that
antioch
could
not
be
held
without
the
frontier
and
when
louis
arrived
raymond
tried
hard
to
persuade
him
to
abandon
his
pilgrimage
for
that
season
and
make
a
campaign
in
the
north
william
of
tyre
thought
the
plan
good
and
believed
that
the
saracens
were
for
the
moment
too
demoralized
to
resist
evidently
by
advancing
from
antioch
could
have
been
isolated
whereas
on
the
south
he
was
covered
by
damascus
one
of
the
strongest
places
in
the
east
such
considerations
had
no
weight
with
louis
for
to
his
emotional
temperament
military
strategy
lay
in
obtaining
supernatural
aid
without
which
no
wisdom
could
avail
and
with
which
victory
was
sure
he
therefore
insisted
on
the
punctilious
performance
of
the
religious
rites
and
one
of
the
most
interesting
passages
in
of
is
the
account
of
the
interview
between
him
and
raymond
when
a
movement
against
the
cities
of
the
north
was
discussed
the
prince
who
had
tried
the
temper
of
the
king
several
times
privately
and
not
found
what
he
wanted
came
one
day
to
him
before
his
barons
and
made
his
requests
to
the
best
of
his
power
many
reasons
he
showed
that
if
he
would
agree
he
would
do
his
soul
much
good
and
would
win
the
applause
of
his
age
christendom
would
be
so
benefited
by
this
thing
the
king
took
counsel
and
then
he
answered
that
he
was
vowed
to
the
sepulchre
and
had
taken
the
cross
particularly
to
go
there
that
since
he
had
left
his
country
he
had
met
with
many
hindrances
and
that
he
had
no
wish
to
begin
any
wars
until
he
had
perfected
his
this
refusal
so
exasperated
prince
raymond
that
he
threw
off
all
disguise
and
became
the
avowed
lover
of
the
queen
who
detested
her
husband
louis
shortly
afterward
escaped
by
night
from
antioch
taking
eleanor
with
him
by
force
and
thus
the
only
hope
for
the
recovery
of
edessa
was
lost
for
the
emotionalist
everything
yielded
to
the
transcendent
importance
of
propitiatory
rites
therefore
louis
ascended
calvary
kissed
the
stones
intoned
the
chants
received
the
benediction
and
lost
palestine
thus
by
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
the
idealist
had
begun
to
flag
in
the
struggle
for
life
an
attempt
indeed
was
afterwards
made
upon
damascus
but
it
only
served
to
expose
the
weakness
of
the
men
who
relied
on
magic
by
the
time
the
advance
began
confidence
had
been
restored
among
the
saracens
the
attack
was
repulsed
and
had
only
to
move
from
the
north
to
throw
the
crusaders
back
upon
jerusalem
covered
with
ridicule
nothing
conveys
so
vivid
an
idea
of
the
shock
these
reverses
gave
believers
as
the
words
in
which
saint
bernard
defended
his
prophecies
do
they
not
say
among
the
pagans
where
is
their
god
nor
is
it
wonderful
the
sons
of
the
church
who
are
known
by
the
name
of
christians
are
laid
low
in
the
desert
destroyed
by
the
sword
or
consumed
by
famine
the
lord
hath
poured
contempt
upon
princes
and
hath
caused
them
to
wander
in
the
wilderness
where
there
is
no
way
grief
and
misfortune
have
followed
their
steps
fear
and
confusion
have
been
in
the
palaces
of
the
kings
themselves
how
have
the
feet
strayed
of
those
promising
peace
and
blessings
we
have
said
peace
and
there
is
no
peace
we
have
promised
good
fortune
and
behold
tribulation
as
if
we
had
acted
in
this
matter
with
rashness
and
levity
yet
if
one
of
two
things
must
be
i
prefer
to
have
men
murmur
against
me
rather
than
god
it
is
good
if
i
am
worthy
to
be
used
as
a
shield
i
take
willingly
the
slanders
of
detractors
and
the
poisoned
stings
of
blasphemers
that
they
may
not
reach
him
i
do
not
shrink
from
loss
of
glory
that
his
may
not
be
attacked
who
gives
it
to
me
to
be
glorified
in
the
words
of
the
psalmist
because
for
thy
sake
i
have
borne
reproach
shame
hath
covered
my
according
to
the
account
of
william
of
tyre
both
sides
felt
the
end
to
be
near
after
the
failure
of
louis
the
pious
prince
raymond
was
the
first
to
go
down
before
the
storm
he
had
too
late
seen
gathering
fell
upon
his
country
with
fire
and
sword
defeated
him
cut
off
his
head
and
right
arm
and
sent
them
to
bagdad
as
trophies
the
wretched
joscelin
died
in
a
dungeon
at
aleppo
while
entered
damascus
and
thus
consolidated
the
syrian
cities
of
the
plain
thenceforward
the
decentralized
franks
lay
helpless
in
the
grasp
of
their
compact
adversary
and
all
that
was
imaginative
in
the
middle
ages
received
its
at
tiberias
that
action
was
the
beginning
of
the
decay
of
the
crusaders
believed
they
had
found
the
cross
on
which
christ
died
at
jerusalem
they
venerated
it
as
a
charm
no
less
powerful
than
the
sepulchre
itself
and
having
this
advantage
over
the
tomb
that
it
was
portable
they
thought
it
invincible
and
used
it
not
only
as
a
weapon
against
living
enemies
but
as
a
means
of
controlling
nature
a
remarkable
example
of
the
magical
properties
of
this
relic
was
given
in
the
retreat
from
bosra
baldwin
iii
was
crowned
in
when
only
thirteen
the
kingdom
was
then
at
peace
with
damascus
in
whose
territory
bosra
lay
but
notwithstanding
the
child
s
advisers
eagerly
listened
to
the
offer
of
the
emir
in
command
to
betray
the
town
and
hastened
forward
the
departure
of
an
expedition
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
the
envoys
from
damascus
on
the
march
the
troops
suffered
severely
from
heat
and
thirst
and
on
their
arrival
were
appalled
to
find
a
loyal
garrison
a
siege
was
out
of
the
question
and
a
regular
retreat
so
hazardous
that
the
barons
besought
the
king
to
fly
and
save
the
cross
but
the
boy
refused
and
stayed
with
his
men
to
fight
to
the
last
the
outlook
was
terrible
for
the
vegetation
was
dry
and
when
the
march
began
the
turks
threw
greek
fire
everywhere
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
country
burned
the
high
flames
and
thick
smoke
blinded
our
men
then
were
they
so
beset
they
knew
not
what
to
do
but
when
there
is
great
need
and
men
s
help
fails
then
should
one
seek
aid
of
our
lord
and
cry
to
him
to
care
for
us
so
did
our
christians
then
for
they
called
the
archbishop
robert
of
nazareth
who
carried
the
true
cross
before
them
and
begged
him
that
he
would
pray
our
lord
who
to
save
them
had
suffered
death
upon
that
cross
that
he
would
bring
them
from
this
peril
for
they
could
not
endure
it
nor
did
they
look
for
other
help
than
his
truly
they
were
there
all
black
and
scorched
like
smiths
from
the
fire
and
smoke
the
archbishop
dismounted
and
kneeled
down
and
prayed
our
lord
with
many
tears
that
he
would
have
mercy
on
his
people
then
he
arose
and
held
the
true
cross
toward
the
fire
which
the
wind
brought
strongly
against
them
our
lord
by
his
great
mercy
regarded
his
people
in
the
great
peril
which
they
suffered
for
the
wind
changed
straightway
and
blew
the
fire
and
smoke
into
the
faces
of
the
enemy
who
had
lighted
it
so
that
they
were
forced
to
scatter
over
the
country
and
fly
our
men
when
they
saw
this
wept
for
joy
for
they
perceived
that
our
lord
had
not
forgotten
even
then
they
were
in
extreme
peril
for
but
one
way
was
open
for
which
they
had
no
guide
suddenly
a
knight
appeared
before
the
troop
whom
no
one
in
the
host
knew
he
sat
a
white
horse
and
carried
a
crimson
banner
he
wore
a
hauberk
whose
sleeves
came
only
to
the
elbow
he
offered
to
guide
them
and
he
put
himself
in
front
he
brought
them
to
cool
sweet
springs
he
made
them
sleep
in
comfortable
and
good
places
and
he
so
guided
them
that
on
the
third
day
they
came
to
the
city
of
the
mighty
relic
of
the
cross
was
taken
and
defiled
by
the
saracens
at
hattin
where
the
christians
suffered
a
decisive
defeat
caused
by
the
impotence
of
the
central
administration
at
jerusalem
reginald
de
chatillon
was
the
type
of
the
twelfth
century
adventurer
he
came
to
palestine
in
the
train
of
louis
the
pious
and
he
stayed
there
because
he
married
a
princess
he
was
a
brave
soldier
but
greedy
violent
and
rash
and
his
insubordination
precipitated
the
catastrophe
which
led
to
the
fall
of
the
capital
at
the
siege
of
ascalon
he
so
fascinated
constance
princess
of
antioch
widow
of
raymond
that
she
persisted
in
marrying
him
although
she
was
sought
by
many
of
the
greatest
nobles
and
he
was
only
a
knight
her
choice
was
disastrous
he
had
hardly
entered
on
his
government
in
the
north
before
he
quarrelled
with
the
greek
emperor
who
forced
him
to
do
penance
with
a
rope
about
his
neck
afterward
he
was
taken
prisoner
by
who
only
liberated
him
after
sixteen
years
when
his
wife
was
dead
he
soon
married
again
this
time
also
another
great
heiress
etiennette
de
milly
lady
of
karak
and
montréal
and
as
her
husband
reginald
became
commander
of
the
fortress
of
karak
to
the
east
of
the
dead
sea
which
formed
the
defence
against
egypt
but
as
the
commander
of
so
important
a
post
this
reckless
and
rapacious
adventurer
defied
the
authority
of
his
feudal
superior
and
by
plundering
caravans
on
the
damascus
road
so
irritated
saladin
that
in
he
burst
with
a
powerful
army
into
the
holy
land
made
king
guy
prisoner
and
the
prince
reginald
whose
head
he
cut
off
with
his
own
guy
de
lusignan
had
been
crowned
at
jerusalem
the
year
before
saladin
s
invasion
and
when
war
broke
out
he
was
at
feud
with
the
count
of
tripoli
the
imminence
of
the
common
danger
brought
about
some
semblance
of
cohesion
among
the
nobles
who
agreed
to
put
every
available
man
in
the
field
the
castles
were
stripped
of
their
garrisons
so
that
they
were
indefensible
in
case
of
reverse
and
about
fifty
thousand
troops
were
concentrated
at
sepphoris
in
galilee
the
contingents
of
the
temple
and
hospital
were
well
organized
and
well
disciplined
but
the
army
as
a
whole
was
rather
a
loose
gathering
of
the
retainers
of
thirty
or
forty
independent
chiefs
than
a
compact
mass
subject
to
a
single
will
such
as
the
egyptian
revenues
enabled
saladin
to
put
in
the
field
suddenly
news
came
to
sepphoris
that
the
saracens
had
poured
through
the
pass
of
banias
and
lay
before
tiberias
dissensions
broke
out
at
once
which
guy
de
lusignan
could
not
control
he
was
not
a
man
of
strong
character
and
had
he
been
he
was
only
one
among
a
dozen
princes
any
one
of
whom
could
quit
the
army
and
retire
to
his
castle
if
he
felt
so
disposed
the
count
of
tripoli
who
seems
to
have
been
the
ablest
soldier
among
the
franks
saw
the
folly
of
leaving
water
and
marching
across
a
burning
country
under
a
july
sun
instead
of
waiting
to
be
attacked
as
he
represented
he
of
all
men
was
most
interested
in
relieving
tiberias
for
it
was
his
town
and
his
wife
was
within
the
walls
yet
such
was
the
jealousy
of
him
in
the
latin
camp
that
his
advice
was
rejected
and
an
advance
began
on
july
three
miles
from
tiberias
the
action
opened
by
a
furious
attack
on
the
rearguard
formed
by
the
temple
and
the
hospital
when
they
gave
ground
guy
lost
heart
and
ordered
a
halt
the
night
which
followed
was
frightful
the
moslems
fired
the
dry
undergrowth
and
amidst
flames
and
smoke
the
franks
lay
till
dawn
tormented
by
hunger
and
thirst
and
exposed
to
clouds
of
arrows
which
the
enemy
poured
in
on
them
at
dawn
fighting
began
again
but
the
demoralized
infantry
fled
to
a
hill
whence
they
refused
to
move
the
count
of
tripoli
seeing
the
battle
lost
cut
his
way
out
with
a
band
of
his
followers
but
guy
de
lusignan
reginald
de
chatillon
and
a
multitude
of
knights
and
nobles
were
captured
the
orders
were
practically
annihilated
the
whole
population
cut
to
pieces
and
the
holy
cross
which
had
been
borne
before
the
host
as
an
invincible
engine
of
war
was
seized
and
defiled
on
the
mountain
where
jesus
taught
his
disciples
to
love
their
enemies
an
arabic
historian
has
described
the
veneration
of
the
christians
for
their
talisman
their
adoration
of
it
in
peace
and
their
devotion
to
it
in
battles
and
his
words
help
a
modern
generation
to
conceive
the
shock
its
worshippers
received
when
it
betrayed
its
helplessness
the
great
cross
was
taken
before
the
king
and
many
of
the
impious
sought
death
about
it
when
it
was
held
aloft
the
infidels
bent
the
knee
and
bowed
the
head
they
had
enriched
it
with
gold
and
jewels
they
carried
it
on
days
of
great
solemnity
and
looked
upon
it
as
their
first
duty
to
defend
it
in
battle
the
capture
of
this
cross
was
more
grievous
to
them
than
the
capture
of
their
chapter
v
the
fall
of
constantinople
most
writers
on
the
crusades
have
noticed
the
change
which
followed
the
battle
of
tiberias
pigeonneau
for
example
in
his
of
pointed
out
that
after
the
loss
of
jerusalem
the
christians
became
more
and
more
intent
on
economic
interests
and
the
crusades
became
more
and
more
political
and
commercial
rather
than
religious
in
other
words
when
decentralization
reached
its
limit
the
form
of
competition
changed
and
consolidation
began
with
the
reopening
of
the
valley
of
the
danube
the
current
turned
at
first
the
tide
ran
feebly
but
after
the
conquest
of
the
holy
land
the
channels
of
trade
altered
capital
began
to
accumulate
and
by
the
thirteenth
century
money
controlled
palestine
and
italy
and
was
rapidly
subduing
france
heyd
remarked
that
the
commerce
to
the
levant
took
a
leap
during
the
crusades
of
which
the
boldest
imagination
could
hardly
have
dreamed
shortly
before
because
the
possession
of
the
syrian
ports
brought
europe
into
direct
communication
with
asia
and
accelerated
exchanges
from
the
dawn
of
european
history
to
the
rise
of
modern
london
the
eastern
trade
has
enriched
every
community
where
it
has
centred
and
among
others
north
italy
in
the
middle
ages
venice
florence
genoa
and
pisa
were
its
creations
in
the
year
when
the
barbarian
migrations
were
flowing
over
the
roman
provinces
in
steadily
increasing
volume
the
huns
sacked
aquileia
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
ravaged
districts
fled
for
shelter
to
the
islands
which
lie
in
the
shallow
water
at
the
head
of
the
adriatic
for
many
generations
these
fugitives
remained
poor
subsisting
mainly
on
fish
and
selling
salt
as
their
only
product
but
gradually
they
developed
into
a
race
highly
adapted
to
flourish
under
the
conditions
which
began
to
prevail
after
the
council
of
clermont
isolated
save
toward
the
sea
without
agriculture
or
mines
but
two
paths
were
open
to
them
piracy
and
commerce
and
they
excelled
in
both
by
the
reign
of
charlemagne
they
were
prosperous
and
when
the
closing
of
the
valley
of
the
danube
forced
traffic
to
go
by
sea
venice
and
amalfi
obtained
a
monopoly
of
what
was
left
of
the
eastern
trade
for
many
years
however
that
trade
was
not
highly
lucrative
though
rome
always
offered
a
certain
market
for
brocades
for
vestments
and
for
altar
coverings
for
incense
and
jewels
for
shrines
ready
money
was
scarce
the
west
having
few
products
which
asiatics
or
africans
were
willing
to
take
in
exchange
for
their
goods
therefore
it
was
not
through
enterprises
sanctioned
by
the
priesthood
that
venice
won
in
the
economic
competition
which
began
to
prevail
in
the
eleventh
century
venetians
prospered
because
they
were
bolder
and
more
unscrupulous
than
their
neighbours
they
did
without
compunction
what
was
needful
for
gain
even
when
the
needful
thing
was
a
damnable
crime
in
the
eyes
of
the
devout
the
valley
of
the
nile
though
fertile
produces
neither
wood
nor
iron
nor
men
of
the
fighting
type
for
these
the
caliphs
were
ready
to
pay
and
the
venetians
provided
them
all
even
as
early
as
dealings
with
the
common
enemy
in
material
of
war
had
reached
proportions
which
not
only
stimulated
the
emperor
john
zimisces
to
energetic
diplomatic
remonstrance
but
made
him
threaten
to
burn
all
the
ships
he
captured
laden
with
suspicious
cargoes
to
sell
timber
for
ships
and
iron
for
swords
to
the
saracens
was
a
mortal
sin
in
children
of
the
church
but
such
a
sin
was
as
nothing
beside
the
infamy
of
kidnapping
believers
as
slaves
for
infidels
who
made
them
soldiers
to
fight
against
their
god
charlemagne
and
the
popes
after
him
tried
to
suppress
the
traffic
but
without
avail
slaving
was
so
lucrative
that
it
was
carried
on
in
the
streets
of
rome
herself
and
in
the
thirteenth
century
two
thousand
europeans
were
annually
disposed
of
in
damietta
and
alexandria
from
whom
the
mamelukes
the
finest
corps
of
soldiers
in
the
east
were
recruited
thus
a
race
grew
up
in
italy
which
differed
from
the
people
of
france
and
germany
because
of
the
absence
of
those
qualities
which
had
caused
the
germans
to
survive
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
empire
decayed
the
mediæval
italians
prospered
because
they
were
lacking
in
the
imagination
which
made
the
northern
peoples
subservient
to
the
and
among
mediæval
italians
the
venetians
from
their
exposed
position
came
to
be
the
most
daring
energetic
and
unscrupulous
by
the
end
of
the
eleventh
century
their
fleet
was
so
superior
to
the
greek
that
the
emperor
alexis
had
to
confide
to
them
the
defence
of
the
harbour
of
durazzo
against
robert
guiscard
guiscard
attacked
durazzo
in
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
which
immediately
preceded
the
debasement
of
the
byzantine
coinage
and
the
demonstration
that
venice
had
already
absorbed
most
of
the
carrying
trade
seems
to
prove
that
during
the
last
half
of
the
eleventh
century
the
centre
of
exchanges
had
a
pronounced
tendency
to
abandon
constantinople
moreover
the
result
of
the
campaign
showed
that
the
venetian
navy
was
the
strongest
in
the
mediterranean
and
this
was
of
vital
moment
to
the
success
of
the
crusades
twenty
years
later
for
without
the
command
of
the
sea
the
permanent
occupation
of
palestine
would
have
been
impossible
after
the
capture
of
jerusalem
in
almost
the
first
operations
of
godfrey
de
bouillon
were
against
the
syrian
ports
but
as
he
controlled
too
small
a
force
to
act
alone
he
made
a
treaty
with
venice
by
which
in
consideration
of
two
hundred
ships
he
promised
to
cede
to
her
a
third
part
of
every
town
taken
baldwin
made
a
similar
arrangement
with
the
genoese
and
as
the
coast
was
subdued
the
italian
cities
assumed
their
grants
and
established
their
administrations
in
the
end
the
venetians
predominated
at
tyre
the
genoese
at
acre
and
the
pisans
at
antioch
before
the
discovery
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
spices
drugs
brocades
carpets
porcelains
and
gems
of
india
and
china
reached
the
mediterranean
mainly
by
two
routes
one
by
way
of
the
persian
gulf
to
bagdad
up
the
euphrates
to
rakka
and
by
land
to
aleppo
whence
they
were
conveyed
by
caravan
either
to
antioch
or

exchanges
must
have
become
more
favourable
to
her
as
is
proved
by
the
increased
supply
of
the
precious
metals
why
the
short
period
of
expansion
which
followed
upon
the
of
the
silver
standard
in
the
west
should
have
been
succeeded
by
a
sharp
contraction
is
unknown
but
the
fact
seems
proved
by
the
coinage
in
the
reign
of
charlemagne
a
silver
pound
of
grains
was
made
the
monetary
unit
which
was
divided
into
denarii
or
pence
for
some
time
these
pence
were
tolerably
maintained
but
as
the
empire
of
charlemagne
disintegrated
they
deteriorated
until
by
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
those
coined
at
venice
were
but
a
quarter
of
their
original
weight
and
three
parts
alloy
after
hattin
a
new
expansion
began
in
which
venice
took
the
lead
the
battle
was
fought
in
and
some
years
later
but
probably
before
the
grosso
was
struck
a
piece
of
fine
silver
of
good
weight
which
thereafter
was
maintained
at
the
standard
half
a
century
later
gold
appeared
florence
coined
the
florin
in
venice
the
ducat
in
and
between
the
two
dates
saint
louis
issued
his
crowns
the
return
of
the
precious
metals
to
the
west
indicated
a
revival
of
trade
and
a
change
in
the
form
of
competition
instead
of
the
imagination
the
economic
faculty
began
to
predominate
and
energy
chose
money
as
its
vent
within
a
generation
the
miracle
fell
decisively
in
power
and
the
beginning
of
this
most
crucial
of
social
revolutions
is
visible
in
the
third
crusade
the
famous
expedition
led
by
philip
augustus
and
cœur
de
lion
these
two
great
soldiers
probably
learned
the
art
of
fortification
at
the
siege
of
acre
the
most
remarkable
passage
of
arms
of
the
middle
ages
the
siege
is
said
to
have
cost
one
hundred
thousand
lives
and
certainly
called
forth
all
the
engineering
skill
of
the
time
guy
de
lusignan
having
been
liberated
by
saladin
soon
after
hattin
wandered
about
the
country
abandoned
and
forlorn
until
at
last
he
sat
down
before
acre
in
with
a
force
inferior
to
the
garrison
there
he
was
joined
by
the
kings
of
france
and
england
who
succeeded
in
capturing
the
city
after
a
desperate
defence
of
two
years
an
immense
booty
was
taken
but
the
clergy
complained
that
two
secular
princes
had
embezzled
the
heritage
of
god
on
the
other
hand
the
troops
had
not
received
the
usual
assistance
from
miracles
for
though
assaults
were
delivered
almost
daily
none
were
worked
and
the
virgin
herself
only
appeared
once
and
then
so
quietly
as
to
arouse
no
enthusiasm
after
the
surrender
philip
went
home
while
richard
remained
in
command
the
whole
country
had
been
overrun
only
a
few
strongholds
like
the
krak
des
chevaliers
and
tortosa
held
out
and
richard
far
from
following
the
example
of
the
first
crusaders
who
marched
straight
for
the
relics
at
jerusalem
turned
his
attention
to
the
centres
of
trade
upon
the
coast
he
moved
south
along
the
shore
keeping
close
to
his
fleet
with
the
enemy
following
on
the
mountains
as
he
approached
joppa
the
saracens
descended
into
the
plain
and
gave
battle
they
were
decisively
defeated
and
richard
occupied
joppa
without
resistance
from
joppa
the
road
ran
direct
to
jerusalem
the
way
was
not
long
nor
the
country
difficult
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
an
attack
to
have
been
particularly
hazardous
on
the
contrary
when
richard
advanced
the
opposition
was
not
unusually
stubborn
and
he
actually
pursued
the
enemy
to
within
sight
of
the
walls
yet
he
resolutely
resisted
the
pressure
of
the
clergy
to
undertake
a
siege
the
inference
being
that
the
power
which
controlled
him
held
jerusalem
to
be
worthless
that
power
must
have
been
capital
for
the
treaty
which
he
negotiated
was
as
frankly
mercenary
as
though
made
in
modern
times
the
seaboard
from
tyre
to
joppa
was
ceded
to
the
franks
ascalon
which
was
the
key
to
egypt
was
dismantled
and
the
only
mention
made
of
jerusalem
was
that
it
should
be
open
to
pilgrims
in
the
future
as
it
had
been
in
the
past
of
the
cross
which
fifty
years
before
had
been
prized
above
all
the
treasures
of
the
east
not
a
word
was
said
nor
does
it
appear
that
after
hattin
either
infidels
or
christians
attached
a
money
value
to
it
some
chroniclers
have
insisted
that
richard
felt
remorse
at
thus
abandoning
his
god
and
when
in
a
skirmish
he
saw
the
walls
of
jerusalem
they
related
that
he
hid
his
face
and
wept
he
may
have
done
so
but
during
his
life
the
time
came
when
christian
knights
felt
naught
but
exultation
at
having
successfully
bartered
the
sepulchre
for
money
after
richard
s
departure
the
situation
of
the
franks
in
the
holy
land
went
rapidly
from
bad
to
worse
the
decay
of
faith
constantly
relaxed
the
bond
which
had
once
united
them
against
the
moslems
while
they
were
divided
amongst
themselves
by
commercial
jealousies
the
temple
and
the
hospital
carried
on
perpetual
private
wars
about
disputed
property
the
fourth
crusade
miscarried
and
the
garrison
of
joppa
was
massacred
while
europe
looked
on
with
indifference
when
this
point
was
reached
the
instinct
of
seems
to
have
roused
the
clergy
to
the
fact
that
their
fate
was
bound
up
with
the
fate
of
the
holy
places
if
the
miracle
were
discredited
their
reign
was
at
an
end
accordingly
innocent
on
his
election
threw
himself
into
a
new
agitation
with
all
the
intensity
of
his
nature
foulques
de
neuilly
was
chosen
to
preach
like
saint
bernard
but
his
success
at
first
was
not
flattering
he
was
insulted
publicly
by
richard
and
was
even
accused
of
having
embezzled
the
funds
entrusted
to
him
at
length
in
the
year
tybalt
count
of
champagne
and
louis
count
of
blois
took
the
cross
at
a
tournament
they
were
holding
at
the
castle
of
ecry
they
soon
were
joined
by
others
but
probably
the
most
famous
baron
of
the
pilgrimage
was
simon
de
montfort
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
the
great
fiefs
had
not
been
absorbed
and
the
count
of
champagne
was
a
powerful
sovereign
he
was
therefore
chosen
leader
of
the
expedition
and
at
a
meeting
held
at
compiègne
the
three
chief
princes
agreed
to
send
a
committee
of
six
to
venice
to
contract
for
transportation
in
this
committee
who
wrote
the
chronicle
of
the
war
represented
tybalt
the
doge
was
then
henry
dandolo
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
man
venice
ever
produced
though
nearly
he
was
as
vigorous
as
in
middle
life
a
materialist
and
a
sceptic
he
was
the
best
sailor
the
ablest
diplomatist
and
the
keenest
speculator
in
europe
and
while
as
a
statesman
and
a
commander
he
raised
his
country
to
the
pinnacle
of
glory
he
proved
himself
the
easy
superior
of
innocent
iii
in
intrigue
so
eminent
were
his
abilities
that
by
common
consent
he
was
chosen
leader
of
a
force
which
held
some
of
the
foremost
captains
of
the
age
and
when
by
his
sagacity
constantinople
had
been
captured
he
refused
the
imperial
crown
always
spoke
of
him
with
deep
respect
as
the
good
duke
exceeding
wise
and
prudent
and
indeed
without
him
the
frankish
princes
would
certainly
have
fallen
victims
to
the
cunning
of
the
greeks
whom
he
alone
knew
how
to
and
whom
he
hated
because
his
eyes
had
been
seared
by
the
emperor
manuel
comnenus
when
he
had
been
upon
a
mission
at
his
court
in
his
hands
the
frankish
envoys
were
like
children
bewildered
by
the
wealth
and
splendour
which
surrounded
them
after
stating
their
errand
to
dandolo
they
waited
eight
days
for
an
answer
and
were
then
tendered
a
contract
which
has
the
look
of
having
been
part
of
a
premeditated
plan
to
ensnare
the
crusaders
and
make
them
serve
the
republic
the
venetians
bound
themselves
to
provide
shipping
for
knights
with
their
horses
squires
and
foot
with
provisions
for
nine
months
for
marks
of
silver
probably
about
equal
to
of
our
money
but
beside
this
the
city
proposed
for
the
love
of
god
to
add
fifty
galleys
and
divide
the
conquests
equally
whatever
its
character
and
however
much
such
obligations
were
beyond
the
ability
of
the
franks
the
contract
was
executed
and
sent
to
innocent
for
ratification
who
approved
it
with
the
proviso
that
no
hostilities
should
be
undertaken
against
christians
during
the
crusade
the
pilgrims
were
to
meet
at
venice
in
the
spring
when
returned
tybalt
was
dying
and
his
loss
threw
all
into
confusion
possibly
also
the
suspicion
spread
that
the
venetians
had
imposed
on
the
committee
for
many
of
the
nobles
sailed
from
other
ports
where
better
terms
were
to
be
made
among
whom
was
reginald
de
dampierre
to
whom
tybalt
had
confided
his
treasure
so
in
the
spring
of
hardly
more
than
half
the
knights
presented
themselves
at
venice
and
these
found
it
quite
impossible
to
meet
their
engagements
even
when
the
princes
had
sent
their
plate
and
jewels
to
the
ducal
palace
a
deficit
estimated
at
marks
remained
on
their
side
the
venetians
declined
to
make
any
abatement
of
their
price
but
offered
as
a
compromise
to
give
time
and
collect
the
balance
from
plunder
as
a
preliminary
they
proposed
an
attack
on
zara
an
adriatic
port
which
had
revolted
and
transferred
its
allegiance
to
the
king
of
hungary
few
propositions
could
have
been
a
greater
outrage
on
the
church
not
only
were
the
people
of
zara
against
whom
the
franks
had
no
complaint
but
the
king
of
hungary
was
himself
a
crusader
his
dominions
were
under
the
protection
of
the
pope
and
an
attack
on
him
was
tantamount
to
an
attack
on
rome
herself
on
these
points
difference
of
opinion
was
impossible
and
the
papal
legate
with
all
the
other
ecclesiastics
denounced
the
venetians
and
threatened
them
with
excommunication
the
result
showed
that
force
already
expressed
itself
in
the
west
through
money
and
not
through
the
imagination
what
followed
is
the
more
interesting
since
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
when
beyond
the
alps
and
withdrawn
from
the
pressure
of
capital
the
french
barons
were
as
emotional
as
ever
while
these
very
negotiations
were
pending
the
subjects
of
philip
augustus
had
deserted
him
in
a
mass
and
had
grovelled
before
innocent
as
submissively
as
if
he
had
been
hildebrand
the
first
wife
of
philip
augustus
was
ingeburga
a
danish
princess
for
whom
he
had
an
irrepressible
disinclination
in
he
obtained
a
divorce
from
her
by
an
assembly
of
prelates
presided
over
by
the
cardinal
of
champagne
he
then
married
agnes
de
méranie
to
whom
he
was
devotedly
attached
ingeburga
appealed
to
rome
and
innocent
declared
the
divorce
void
and
ordered
philip
to
separate
from
his
philip
refused
and
innocent
commanded
his
legate
to
put
the
kingdom
under
interdict
at
vienne
in
the
month
of
january
at
the
dead
of
night
the
magical
formulas
were
recited
when
the
christ
upon
the
altar
had
been
veiled
the
sacred
wafer
burned
the
corpses
hidden
in
the
crypt
before
the
shuddering
people
the
priest
laid
his
curse
upon
the
king
until
he
should
put
away
his
harlot
from
that
hour
all
religious
rites
were
suspended
the
church
doors
were
barred
the
bells
were
silent
the
sick
died
unshriven
the
dead
lay
unburied
the
king
summoned
his
bishops
and
threatened
to
drive
them
from
france
it
was
of
no
avail
the
barons
shrank
from
him
his
very
fell
off
from
him
he
was
alone
as
henry
had
been
at
canossa
the
people
were
frenzied
and
even
went
to
england
to
obtain
priestly
aid
the
count
of
ponthieu
had
to
marry
philip
s
sister
at
rouen
within
the
norman
jurisdiction
in
his
extremity
philip
called
a
parliament
at
paris
and
agnes
clad
in
mourning
implored
protection
but
not
a
man
moved
a
mortal
terror
was
in
every
heart
she
was
then
in
the
seventh
month
the
assembly
decided
that
the
king
must
submit
and
agnes
supplicated
the
pope
not
to
divide
her
from
her
husband
the
crown
she
said
was
indifferent
to
her
but
this
was
a
struggle
for
supremacy
and
innocent
was
inexorable
a
council
was
convened
at
néelle
where
philip
promised
to
take
back
ingeburga
and
part
from
agnes
he
explained
that
she
was
pregnant
and
to
leave
the
realm
might
kill
her
but
the
priests
demanded
absolute
submission
and
he
swore
upon
the
evangelists
to
see
her
no
more
agnes
broken
by
her
misery
set
forth
for
a
norman
castle
where
she
died
in
bearing
a
son
whom
she
called
tristan
from
her
sorrow
at
his
birth
the
soldier
who
belonged
to
the
old
imaginative
society
had
been
conquered
by
the
church
which
was
the
incarnation
of
the
imagination
but
dandolo
was
a
different
development
he
was
the
creation
of
economic
competition
and
he
trampled
the
clergy
under
his
feet
although
apparently
profoundly
sceptical
as
the
man
must
be
who
is
the
channel
through
which
money
acts
he
understood
how
to
play
upon
the
imaginations
of
others
and
arranged
a
solemn
function
to
glorify
the
sepulchre
one
sunday
he
summoned
both
citizens
and
pilgrims
to
saint
mark
s
and
mounting
the
pulpit
he
addressed
the
congregation
my
lords
you
are
engaged
to
the
greatest
people
of
the
world
for
the
highest
enterprise
that
ever
was
undertaken
and
i
am
old
and
feeble
and
need
repose
and
am
infirm
in
body
but
i
see
that
none
can
command
and
control
you
as
i
can
who
am
your
doge
if
you
will
permit
me
to
take
the
cross
to
lead
you
and
let
my
son
stay
here
in
my
place
and
conduct
the
government
i
will
go
to
live
or
die
with
you
and
with
the
s
simple
chronicle
shows
how
perfectly
the
old
man
knew
his
audience
there
was
great
pity
among
the
people
of
the
country
and
the
pilgrims
and
many
tears
were
shed
because
this
worthy
man
had
so
much
cause
to
stay
behind
for
he
was
old
and
his
sight
amidst
an
outburst
of
enthusiasm
assent
was
given
then
while
the
church
rang
with
shouts
dandolo
knelt
before
the
altar
in
a
passion
of
tears
fixed
the
cross
to
the
ducal
bonnet
and
rose
the
commander
of
the
finest
army
in
the
world
and
dandolo
was
a
great
commander
a
commander
of
the
highest
stamp
he
tolerated
no
insubordination
and
trod
the
clergy
down
when
peter
of
capua
the
papal
legate
interfered
dandolo
sternly
told
him
that
the
army
of
christ
lacked
not
for
military
chiefs
and
that
if
priests
would
stay
therein
they
must
content
themselves
with
prayers
a
cistercian
monk
named
gunther
who
had
been
appointed
to
follow
his
abbot
on
the
pilgrimage
kept
a
chronicle
of
what
he
saw
his
superior
named
martin
was
so
disheartened
at
venice
that
he
asked
the
legate
for
absolution
from
his
vow
and
for
permission
to
return
to
his
convent
at
bâle
but
this
request
the
cardinal
refused
the
priests
had
determined
to
stay
by
dandolo
and
fight
him
to
the
last
therefore
the
abbot
sailed
with
the
venetians
but
he
learned
a
bitter
lesson
at
zara
there
the
clergy
received
a
letter
from
innocent
explaining
the
position
of
the
church
and
threatening
with
excommunication
all
who
should
molest
the
king
of
hungary
simon
de
montfort
and
a
portion
of
the
more
devout
who
had
from
the
first
been
scandalized
at
the
contract
made
with
dandolo
then
withdrew
and
camped
apart
and
at
a
meeting
called
to
consider
the
situation
guy
abbot
of
tried
to
read
the
letter
an
outbreak
followed
and
some
of
the
chroniclers
assert
that
the
venetians
would
have
murdered
guy
had
not
simon
de
montfort
stood
by
him
sword
in
hand
on
the
main
point
there
is
no
doubt
the
priests
ignominiously
failed
to
protect
their
ally
the
attack
was
made
and
nothing
shows
that
even
de
montfort
refused
to
share
in
it
or
to
partake
of
the
plunder
after
the
city
fell
there
was
no
resistance
the
besieged
made
no
better
defence
than
hanging
crosses
on
their
walls
and
on
the
fifth
day
capitulated
first
the
franks
divided
the
plunder
with
the
italians
then
they
sent
an
embassy
to
rome
to
ask
for
absolution
they
alleged
that
they
were
helpless
and
either
had
to
accept
the
terms
offered
by
dandolo
or
abandon
their
enterprise
innocent
submitted
he
coupled
his
forgiveness
indeed
with
the
condition
that
the
plunder
should
be
returned
yet
no
record
remains
that
a
single
mark
of
all
the
treasures
taken
from
zara
ever
found
its
way
back
to
the
original
owners
the
venetians
neither
asked
for
pardon
nor
noticed
the
excommunication
on
the
contrary
dandolo
used
the
time
when
the
envoys
were
at
rome
in
maturing
the
monstrous
crime
of
diverting
the
crusade
from
palestine
to
constantinople
just
before
the
departure
from
venice
an
event
happened
which
called
one
of
the
greatest
marvels
you
ever
heard
in
the
greek
emperor
named
isaac
had
been
dethroned
imprisoned
and
blinded
by
his
brother
alexis
who
usurped
the
throne
isaac
s
son
also
named
alexis
escaped
and
took
shelter
with
his
philip
of
swabia
philip
could
not
help
him
but
suggested
to
him
to
apply
to
the
crusaders
in
venice
and
ask
them
for
aid
whether
or
not
this
application
had
been
arranged
by
dandolo
does
not
appear
alexis
went
to
venice
where
he
was
cordially
received
by
the
doge
but
as
the
fleet
was
then
weighing
anchor
his
affairs
were
postponed
until
after
the
attack
on
zara
when
an
embassy
from
philip
arrived
which
brought
up
the
whole
situation
at
constantinople
for
consideration
in
the
struggle
which
followed
between
the
venetians
and
the
church
the
franks
lay
like
a
prize
destined
to
fall
to
the
stronger
and
in
gunther
s
narrative
the
love
the
priests
bore
their
natural
champions
can
be
plainly
seen
in
the
thirteenth
century
as
in
the
fifth
century
the
ecclesiastics
recognized
that
over
a
monied
oligarchy
they
could
never
have
control
accordingly
the
monks
hated
the
venetians
whom
gunther
stigmatized
as
a
people
excessively
greedy
of
money
always
ready
to
commit
sacrilege
for
gain
on
his
side
dandolo
followed
his
instinct
and
tried
to
bribe
the
pope
by
offering
him
an
union
of
the
communions
but
innocent
was
inflexible
he
wrote
in
indignation
that
the
crusaders
had
sworn
to
avenge
the
wrongs
of
christ
and
likened
those
who
should
turn
back
to
lot
s
wife
whom
god
turned
into
a
pillar
of
salt
for
disobeying
his
commands
yet
though
the
priesthood
put
forth
its
whole
strength
it
was
beaten
the
power
of
wealth
was
too
great
no
serious
defection
took
place
gave
a
list
of
those
who
left
the
fleet
among
whom
was
simon
de
montfort
adding
contemptuously
thus
those
left
the
host
which
was
great
shame
to
judging
by
the
words
alone
a
century
might
have
separated
the
writer
and
his
comrades
from
the
barons
who
abandoned
agnes
to
innocent
yet
they
were
the
same
men
transplanted
to
an
economic
civilization
and
excited
by
the
power
of
wealth
on
easter
monday
the
fleet
sailed
for
corfu
where
another
and
more
serious
split
occurred
but
the
dazzling
prize
finally
prevailed
over
the
fear
of
the
supernatural
and
getting
under
way
once
more
the
pilgrims
crossed
the
sea
of
marmora
and
anchored
at
the
convent
of
saint
stephen
about
twelve
miles
from
constantinople
since
exchanges
had
again
returned
to
italy
the
vitality
of
the
greek
empire
had
burned
low
it
was
failing
fast
through
inanition
but
byzantium
was
still
defended
by
those
stupendous
fortifications
which
were
impregnable
from
the
land
and
only
to
be
assailed
from
the
sea
by
an
admiral
of
genius
such
an
one
was
dandolo
a
born
seaman
sagacious
yet
fiery
and
besides
a
pilot
of
the
port
at
a
council
of
war
he
laid
out
a
plan
of
campaign
my
lords
i
know
more
of
the
character
of
this
country
than
you
do
for
i
have
been
here
before
you
have
before
you
the
greatest
and
most
perilous
enterprise
which
any
men
have
ever
undertaken
and
therefore
it
would
be
well
that
we
should
act
he
then
explained
how
the
attack
should
be
made
and
had
the
franks
implicitly
obeyed
him
the
town
would
have
been
carried
at
the
first
assault
three
days
later
the
allies
occupied
scutari
the
asiatic
suburb
of
constantinople
and
lay
there
ten
days
collecting
supplies
on
the
twelfth
they
stormed
the
tower
of
galata
which
commanded
pera
the
key
to
the
golden
horn
while
the
action
was
going
on
dandolo
forced
his
way
into
the
port
the
entrance
was
defended
not
only
by
a
great
tower
but
by
a
huge
iron
chain
fastened
to
piles
and
covered
by
twenty
galleys
armed
with
machines
nothing
stopped
the
venetians
disregarding
the
fire
the
sailors
sprang
on
the
chain
and
from
thence
gained
the
decks
of
the
greek
galleys
whose
crews
they
threw
overboard
meanwhile
one
of
the
italian
ships
provided
with
steel
shears
bore
down
on
the
cable
cut
it
and
led
the
way
into
the
harbour
the
weakest
part
of
the
walls
being
uncovered
dandolo
insisted
that
the
only
hope
for
success
lay
in
assaulting
from
where
the
battlements
were
lowest
but
the
french
obstinately
refused
to
depart
from
their
habits
and
determined
to
fight
on
horseback
the
event
proved
dandolo
s
wisdom
for
though
the
attack
failed
through
the
mistake
of
dividing
the
force
and
of
attempting
the
fortifications
toward
the
land
the
doge
so
led
his
sailors
that
kindled
with
enthusiasm
as
he
told
the
tale
when
the
old
man
saw
his
ships
recoil
before
the
tremendous
fire
from
the
battlements
so
that
the
galleys
could
not
make
the
land
then
there
was
seen
a
strange
sight
for
the
duke
of
venice
who
was
an
old
man
and
saw
not
well
was
fully
armed
and
commanded
his
galley
and
had
the
gonfalon
of
saint
mark
s
before
him
and
he
cried
to
his
men
to
put
him
ashore
or
if
they
would
not
he
would
do
justice
on
their
bodies
and
they
brought
the
galley
to
shore
and
they
sallied
forth
and
carried
the
banner
before
him
to
the
shore
and
when
the
venetians
saw
the
gonfalon
of
saint
mark
s
ashore
and
the
galley
of
the
lord
ashore
before
them
they
were
all
ashamed
and
made
for
the
land
and
rushed
out
from
their
ships
then
might
one
see
a
marvellous
assault
and
thus
testifies
geoffrey
de
the
marshal
of
champagne
who
dictates
this
book
that
more
than
forty
declare
they
saw
the
banner
of
saint
mark
of
venice
on
one
of
the
towers
and
none
knew
who
carried
it
once
a
foothold
on
the
ramparts
had
been
gained
the
greeks
fled
towers
fell
in
quick
succession
and
the
italians
had
already
entered
the
streets
and
fired
the
houses
to
drive
the
enemy
from
the
roofs
when
news
was
brought
that
alexis
was
advancing
from
the
gates
and
threatened
to
envelop
the
french
indeed
the
danger
was
extreme
for
as
explained
the
crusaders
were
wondrous
few
when
compared
with
the
garrison
for
they
had
so
many
men
we
should
all
have
been
engulfed
amongst
with
the
instinct
of
a
great
commander
dandolo
instantly
sounded
a
retreat
abandoned
the
town
and
hastened
to
the
support
of
his
allies
he
reached
the
ground
opportunely
for
alexis
when
he
saw
the
reinforcement
retreated
without
striking
a
blow
that
night
alexis
fled
leaving
constantinople
without
a
government
and
the
people
took
the
blind
isaac
from
his
dungeon
and
set
him
on
the
throne
in
theory
therefore
the
work
of
the
crusaders
was
done
and
they
were
free
to
embark
for
palestine
to
battle
for
the
sepulchre
in
fact
the
thing
they
came
for
remained
to
be
obtained
and
what
they
demanded
amounted
to
the
ruin
of
the
empire
young
alexis
had
promised
marks
of
silver
to
join
the
crusade
himself
to
provide
rations
for
a
year
and
to
recognize
the
supremacy
of
rome
but
such
promises
were
impossible
to
fulfil
during
a
delay
of
six
months
the
situation
daily
grew
more
strained
a
bitter
hatred
sprang
up
between
the
foreigners
and
the
natives
riots
broke
out
conflagrations
followed
and
at
last
the
allies
sent
a
deputation
to
the
palace
to
demand
the
execution
of
the
treaty
in
despair
alexis
attacked
the
fleet
with
and
his
failure
led
to
a
revolution
in
which
he
was
killed
isaac
died
from
terror
and
one
moursouffle
was
raised
to
the
throne
in
their
extremity
the
greeks
had
recourse
to
treachery
and
nearly
succeeded
in
enticing
the
frankish
princes
to
a
banquet
at
which
they
were
to
have
been
assassinated
the
plot
was
frustrated
by
the
sagacity
of
dandolo
who
would
allow
no
one
to
trust
themselves
within
the
walls
then
both
sides
prepared
for
war
defeat
had
taught
the
franks
obedience
and
they
consented
to
serve
on
the
galleys
they
embarked
on
april
to
be
ready
for
an
assault
in
the
morning
but
though
the
attack
was
made
in
more
than
one
hundred
places
at
once
yet
for
our
sins
were
the
pilgrims
then
the
landsmen
proposed
to
try
some
other
part
of
the
walls
but
the
sailors
told
them
that
elsewhere
the
current
would
sweep
them
away
and
know
said
the
marshal
there
were
some
who
would
have
been
well
content
had
the
current
swept
them
away
altogether
for
they
were
in
great
this
repulse
fell
on
a
friday
the
following
monday
the
attack
was
renewed
and
at
first
with
small
success
but
at
length
our
lord
raised
a
wind
called
boreas
and
two
ships
which
were
lashed
together
the
one
named
the
and
the
other
the
approached
a
tower
on
either
side
just
as
god
and
the
wind
brought
them
so
that
the
ladder
of
the
was
fixed
to
the
tower
and
straightway
a
venetian
and
a
french
knight
scaled
the
tower
and
others
followed
them
and
those
in
the
lower
were
discomforted
and
from
the
moment
the
walls
were
carried
the
battle
turned
into
a
massacre
the
ramparts
were
scaled
in
all
directions
the
gates
were
burst
open
with
battering
rams
the
allies
poured
into
the
streets
and
one
of
the
most
awful
sacks
of
the
middle
ages
began
nothing
was
so
sacred
as
to
escape
from
pillage
the
tombs
of
the
emperors
were
violated
and
the
body
of
justinian
stripped
the
altar
of
the
virgin
the
glory
of
saint
sophia
was
broken
in
pieces
and
the
veil
of
the
sanctuary
torn
to
rags
the
crusaders
played
dice
on
the
tables
which
represented
the
apostles
and
drank
themselves
drunk
in
the
holy
chalices
horses
and
mules
were
driven
into
the
sanctuary
and
when
they
fell
under
their
burdens
the
blood
from
their
wounds
stained
the
floor
of
the
cathedral
at
last
a
young
prostitute
mounted
the
patriarch
s
chair
intoned
a
lewd
chant
and
danced
before
the
pilgrims
thus
fell
constantinople
by
the
arms
of
the
soldiers
of
christ
on
the
twelfth
day
of
april
in
the
year
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
four
since
the
sack
of
rome
by
alaric
no
such
prize
had
ever
fallen
to
a
victor
and
the
crusaders
were
drunk
with
their
success
estimated
that
the
share
of
the
franks
after
deducting
some
fifty
thousand
marks
which
the
venetians
collected
from
them
came
to
four
hundred
thousand
marks
of
silver
not
to
speak
of
masses
of
plunder
of
which
no
account
was
taken
the
gain
was
so
great
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
gold
and
silver
the
precious
stones
the
silks
the
ermines
and
whatever
was
costly
in
the
world
and
geoffrey
de
testifies
of
his
own
knowledge
that
since
the
beginning
of
time
there
was
never
so
much
taken
in
one
town
every
one
took
what
he
wanted
and
there
was
enough
thus
were
the
host
of
the
pilgrims
and
of
the
venetians
quartered
and
there
was
great
joy
and
honour
for
the
victory
which
god
had
given
them
since
those
who
had
been
poor
were
rich
and
in
obedience
to
the
soothsayers
the
devotees
of
louis
the
pious
had
perished
by
tens
of
thousands
and
over
their
corpses
the
moslems
had
marched
to
victory
the
defenders
of
christ
s
cross
had
been
slaughtered
like
sheep
upon
the
mountains
of
the
beatitudes
and
sold
into
slavery
in
herds
at
damascus
and
aleppo
even
the
men
who
at
the
bidding
of
god
s
vicar
had
left
dandolo
to
fight
for
the
sepulchre
upon
the
barren
hills
of
palestine
had
been
immolated
five
hundred
had
perished
in
shipwreck
more
had
been
massacred
in
illyria
none
had
received
reward
but
those
who
in
defiance
of
the
supernatural
and
in
contempt
of
their
vow
had
followed
the
excommunicated
venetian
to
plunder
had
won
immeasurable
glory
and
been
sated
with
incalculable
spoil
the
pilgrims
who
constant
to
the
end
had
been
spilling
their
blood
in
god
s
service
came
trooping
to
the
bosphorus
to
share
in
the
last
remaining
crumbs
the
knights
of
the
temple
and
the
hospital
set
sail
for
greece
where
money
might
still
be
made
by
the
sword
and
the
king
of
jerusalem
stood
before
the
tomb
naked
unto
his
enemies
innocent
himself
was
cowed
his
commands
had
been
disregarded
and
his
curse
defied
laymen
had
insulted
his
legate
and
had
without
consulting
him
divided
among
themselves
the
patronage
of
the
church
and
yet
for
the
strongest
there
was
no
moral
law
when
baldwin
announced
that
he
was
emperor
the
pope
called
him
his
dearest
son
and
received
his
subjects
into
the
roman
communion
but
yesterday
the
greatest
king
of
christendom
had
stood
weeping
begging
for
the
life
of
his
wife
a
hundred
years
earlier
an
emperor
had
stood
barefoot
and
freezing
in
the
snow
at
the
gate
of
canossa
as
a
penance
for
rebellion
but
in
a
venetian
merchant
was
blessed
by
the
haughtiest
of
popes
for
having
stolen
christ
s
army
made
war
on
his
flock
spurned
his
viceregent
flouted
his
legate
and
usurped
his
patrimony
he
had
appointed
a
patriarch
without
a
reference
to
rome
all
was
forgiven
the
appointment
was
confirmed
the
sinner
was
shriven
nothing
could
longer
resist
the
power
of
money
for
consolidation
had
begun
yet
though
nature
may
discriminate
against
him
the
emotionalist
will
always
be
an
emotionalist
for
such
is
the
texture
of
his
brain
and
while
he
breathes
he
will
hate
the
materialist
the
next
year
baldwin
was
defeated
and
captured
by
the
bulgarians
and
then
innocent
wrote
a
letter
to
the
marquis
of
montferrat
which
showed
how
the
wound
had
rankled
when
he
blessed
the
conqueror
he
said
bitterly
you
had
nothing
against
the
greeks
and
you
were
false
to
your
vows
because
you
did
not
fight
the
saracens
but
the
christians
you
did
not
capture
jerusalem
but
constantinople
you
preferred
earthly
to
heavenly
treasures
but
what
was
far
graver
you
have
spared
neither
religion
nor
age
nor
sex
and
you
have
committed
adulteries
fornications
and
incests
before
men
s
eyes
nor
did
the
imperial
treasures
suffice
you
nor
the
plunder
alike
of
rich
and
poor
you
laid
your
hands
on
the
possessions
of
the
church
you
tore
the
silver
panels
from
the
altars
you
broke
into
the
sanctuaries
and
carried
away
the
images
the
crosses
and
the
relics
so
that
the
greeks
though
afflicted
by
persecution
scorn
to
render
obedience
to
the
apostolic
chair
since
they
see
in
the
latins
nothing
but
an
example
of
perdition
and
of
the
works
of
darkness
and
therefore
rightly
abhor
them
more
than
for
the
north
and
west
of
europe
the
crusade
of
constantinople
seems
to
have
been
the
turning
point
whence
the
imagination
rapidly
declined
at
the
opening
of
the
thirteenth
century
everything
shows
that
the
genuine
ecstatic
type
predominated
in
the
church
the
quality
of
mind
which
believed
in
the
miracle
and
therefore
valued
the
amulet
more
than
money
innocent
himself
with
all
his
apparent
worldliness
must
have
been
such
a
man
for
though
the
material
advantages
of
a
union
with
the
greek
church
far
outweighed
the
sepulchre
his
resistance
to
the
diversion
of
the
army
from
palestine
was
unshaken
to
the
last
the
same
feeling
permeated
the
inferior
clergy
and
an
anecdote
told
by
gunther
shows
that
even
so
late
as
the
year
the
monks
unaffectedly
despised
wealth
in
its
vulgar
form
when
therefore
the
victors
set
themselves
with
alacrity
to
spoil
the
conquered
town
which
was
theirs
by
right
of
war
the
abbot
martin
began
to
think
about
his
share
of
the
plunder
and
lest
when
everything
had
been
given
to
others
he
should
be
left
he
proposed
to
stretch
out
his
consecrated
hand
to
the
booty
but
since
he
thought
the
taking
of
secular
things
unworthy
he
bestirred
himself
to
obtain
a
portion
of
the
sacred
relics
which
he
knew
were
there
in
great
the
idea
was
no
sooner
conceived
than
executed
although
private
marauding
was
punished
with
death
he
did
not
hesitate
but
hastened
to
a
church
where
he
found
a
frightened
old
monk
upon
his
knees
whom
he
commanded
in
a
terrible
voice
to
produce
his
relics
or
prepare
for
death
he
was
shown
a
chest
full
to
the
brim
plunging
in
his
arms
he
took
all
he
could
carry
hurried
to
his
ship
and
hid
his
booty
in
his
cabin
and
he
did
this
in
a
town
whose
streets
were
literally
flowing
with
gold
and
silver
he
had
his
reward
though
a
sacrilegious
thief
angels
guarded
him
by
sea
and
land
until
he
reached
his
cloister
at
bâle
then
he
distributed
his
plunder
through
the
diocese
occasionally
when
the
form
of
competition
has
abruptly
changed
nature
works
rapidly
within
a
single
generation
after
hattin
the
attitude
not
only
of
the
laity
but
of
the
clergy
had
been
reversed
and
money
was
recognized
even
by
the
monks
as
the
end
of
human
effort
the
relics
at
jerusalem
had
first
drawn
the
crusaders
to
the
east
and
incidentally
the
capture
of
the
syrian
seaports
led
to
the
reopening
of
trade
and
the
recentralization
of
the
western
world
as
long
as
imagination
remained
the
dominant
force
and
the
miracle
retained
its
power
the
ambition
of
the
franks
was
limited
to
holding
the
country
which
contained
their
talismans
but
as
wealth
accumulated
and
the
economic
type
began
to
supplant
the
ecstatic
a
different
policy
came
to
prevail
beside
the
cities
of
the
holy
land
two
other
portions
of
the
levant
had
a
high
money
value
the
bosphorus
and
the
valley
of
the
nile
in
spite
of
rome
the
venetians
in
had
seized
constantinople
at
the
lateran
council
of
innocent
himself
proposed
an
attack
on
cairo
though
conceived
by
innocent
the
details
of
the
campaign
were
arranged
by
honorius
who
was
consecrated
in
july
these
details
are
however
unimportant
the
interest
of
the
crusade
lies
in
its
close
john
of
brienne
king
of
jerusalem
nominally
commanded
but
the
force
he
led
little
resembled
dandolo
s
far
from
being
that
compact
mass
which
can
only
be
given
cohesion
by
money
it
rather
had
the
character
of
such
an
hysterical
mob
as
louis
the
pious
led
to
destruction
after
some
semblance
of
a
movement
on
jerusalem
the
army
was
conveyed
to
the
delta
of
the
nile
and
damietta
was
invested
in
here
the
besiegers
amounted
to
little
more
than
a
fluctuating
rabble
of
pilgrims
who
came
and
went
at
their
pleasure
usually
serving
about
six
months
among
such
material
military
discipline
could
not
exist
but
on
the
contrary
the
inflammable
multitude
were
peculiarly
adapted
to
be
handled
by
a
priest
and
soon
the
papal
legate
assumed
control
cardinal
pelagius
was
a
spaniard
who
had
been
promoted
by
innocent
in
his
temperament
was
highly
emotional
and
armed
with
plenary
power
by
honorius
he
exerted
himself
to
inflame
the
pilgrims
to
the
utmost
after
a
blockade
of
eighteen
months
damietta
was
reduced
to
extremity
and
to
save
the
city
the
sultan
offered
the
whole
holy
land
except
the
fortress
of
karak
together
with
the
funds
needed
to
rebuild
the
walls
of
jerusalem
king
john
and
all
the
soldiers
who
understood
the
difficulty
of
invading
egypt
favoured
a
peace
but
pelagius
whose
heart
was
fixed
on
the
plunder
of
cairo
prevented
the
council
from
reaching
a
decision
therefore
the
siege
went
on
and
presently
the
ramparts
were
carried
without
loss
as
the
whole
population
had
perished
from
hunger
and
pestilence
this
victory
made
pelagius
a
dictator
and
he
insisted
on
an
advance
on
the
capital
john
and
the
grand
masters
of
the
military
orders
pointed
out
the
disaster
which
must
follow
as
it
was
july
and
the
nile
was
rising
in
a
few
weeks
the
country
would
be
under
water
moreover
the
fleet
could
not
ascend
the
river
therefore
the
army
must
be
isolated
in
the
heart
of
a
hostile
country
and
probably
overwhelmed
by
superior
numbers
pelagius
reviled
them
he
told
them
god
loved
not
cowards
but
champions
who
valued
his
glory
more
than
they
feared
death
he
threatened
them
with
excommunication
should
they
hang
back
near
midsummer
the
march
began
and
the
pilgrims
advanced
to
the
apex
of
the
delta
where
they
halted
with
the
enemy
on
the
opposite
shore
the
river
was
level
with
its
banks
the
situation
was
desperate
and
yet
even
then
the
sultan
sent
an
embassy
offering
the
whole
of
the
holy
land
in
exchange
for
the
evacuation
of
egypt
the
soldiers
of
all
nations
were
strenuously
for
peace
the
priests
as
strenuously
for
war
they
felt
confident
of
repeating
the
sack
of
constantinople
at
cairo
nor
can
there
be
a
greater
contrast
than
martin
spurning
the
wealth
of
constantinople
as
dross
and
pelagius
rejecting
the
sepulchre
that
he
might
glut
himself
with
egyptian
wealth
but
all
history
shows
that
the
emotionalist
can
not
compete
with
the
materialist
upon
his
own
ground
in
the
end
under
free
economic
competition
he
must
be
eliminated
pelagius
tarried
idly
in
the
jaws
of
death
until
the
nile
rose
and
engulfed
him
chapter

the
suppression
of
the
temple
physical
weakness
has
always
been
the
vulnerable
point
of
the
sacred
caste
for
priests
have
rarely
been
warriors
and
faith
has
seldom
been
so
profound
as
to
guarantee
ecclesiastics
against
attack
this
difficulty
was
marked
in
the
early
middle
ages
when
although
disintegration
so
far
prevailed
as
to
threaten
the
very
tradition
of
centralized
power
a
strong
leaven
of
the
ancient
materialism
remained
in
the
ninth
century
the
trend
toward
decentralization
was
resistless
although
several
of
the
descendants
of
charlemagne
were
men
of
ability
and
energy
the
defence
was
so
superior
to
the
attack
that
they
could
not
coerce
their
vassals
and
their
domains
melted
away
into
independent
sovereignties
until
the
crown
became
elective
and
the
monarchy
almost
a
tradition
during
the
tenth
century
it
seems
possible
that
the
regal
authority
might
have
been
obliterated
even
to
the
last
trace
had
it
not
been
for
the
church
which
was
in
sore
need
of
a
champion
the
priesthood
cared
nothing
for
the
legitimate
line
what
they
sought
was
a
protector
and
accordingly
they
chose
not
the
descendant
of
charlemagne
but
him
who
in
the
words
of
the
archbishop
of
rheims
was
distinguished
by
his
wisdom
and
who
found
support
in
the
greatness
of
his
hugh
capet
succeeded
louis
because
he
was
the
best
chief
of
police
in
france
from
such
an
alliance
between
the
priest
and
the
soldier

always
sprung
the
dogma
of
the
divine
right
of

in
mediæval

enchantment
was
a
chief
element
of
the

power
the
monarch
was
anointed
with
a
magic
oil
girt
with
a
sacred
sword
given
a
supernatural
banner
and
endowed
with
the
gift
of
miracles
his
touch
healed
disease
in
return
for
these
gifts
he
fought
the
battles
of
the
church
whose
property
was
the
natural
prey
of
a
predatory
baronage
every
diocese
and
every
abbey
was
embroiled
in
endless
local
wars
which
lasted
from
generation
to
generation
and
sometimes
from
century
to
century
a
good
example
was
the
interminable
feud
between
the
abbey
of
vézelay
and
the
counts
of
nevers
and
a
letter
of
a
papal
legate
named
conon
which
described
one
of
the
countless
raids
gives
an
idea
of
the
ferocity
of
the
attack
the
men
of
the
count
of
nevers
have
burst
open
the
doors
of
the
cloister
have
thrown
stones
on
the
reliquaries
which
contain
the
bodies
of
saint
lazarus
of
saint
martha
of
saint
andocious
and
of
saint
pontianus
they
have
not
even
respected
the
crucifix
in
which
was
preserved
a
morsel
of
the
true
cross
they
have
beaten
the
monks
they
have
driven
them
out
with
stones
and
having
taken
one
of
them
they
have
treated
him
in
an
infamous

the

given
by

crusades
was

subinfeudation
went
on
uninterruptedly
the
capetians
were
as
unable
to
stem
the
current
as
the
carlovingians
before
them
so
that
under
philip
the
royal
domain
had
become
almost
as
much
dismembered
as
the
kingdom
of

of

partisan
warfare
between
the

and
the
petty
nobility
which
had
been
going
on
since
the
time
of
hugh
capet
during
this
long
period
the
kings
had
fought
a
losing
battle
and
without
the
material
resources
of

church
would
have
been
overpowered
even
as
it
was
they
failed
to
hold
their
own
and
yet
the
wealth
of
the
clergy
was
relatively
enormous
the
single
abbey
of
saint
denis
was
said
to
have
controlled
ten
thousand
men
and
though
this
may
be
an
exaggeration
the
corporation
was
organized
on
a
gigantic
scale
between
the
eleventh
and
thirteenth
centuries
it
held
in
france
alone
three
cities
upwards
of
villages
manors
attached
to
these
possessions
over
a
hundred
parishes
and
a
great

valuable

beside
numerous

description
of

dramatic

baron
s
hold
from
whence
he
rode
to
plunder
and
torment
the
people
one
of
the
most
terrible
of
these
robbers
was
hugh
du
puiset
a
man
whom
the
abbot
of
saint
denis
calls
a
ruffian
the
issue
of
a
long
line
of
ruffians
to
the
churchman
hugh
was
the
incarnation
of
evil
he
oppressed
the
clergy
and
though
hated
by
all
few
dared
oppose
him
at
last
he
attacked
adèle
countess
of
chartres
daughter
of
william
the
conqueror
who
went
with
her
son
tybalt
to
seek
redress
from
the
king
louis
did
not
relish
the
campaign
and
the
monk
described
how
the
lady
taunted
him
with
the
defeat
his
father
had
suffered
from
the
father
of
hugh
who
pursued
him
to
orléans
captured
a
hundred
of
his
knights
and
cast
his
bishops
into
dungeons
afterward
an
assembly
was
held
at
melun
to
consider
the
situation
and
there
a
concourse
of
prelates
clerks
and
monks
threw
themselves
at
the
king
s
feet
and
implored
him
to
his
great
embarrassment
to
repress
this
most
greedy
robber
hugh
who
more
rapacious
than
a
wolf
devoured

the
priests
had
cause
for
alarm
for
the
venerable
archbishop
of
chartres
who
was
present
had
been
captured
loaded
with
irons
and
long
left
to
languish
in
prison
three
times
this
baron
was
defeated
but
even
when
a
prisoner
his
family
connection
was
so
powerful
he
was
permitted
to
escape
at
last
he
died
like
a
wolf
fighting
to
the
last
having
impaled
the
seneschal
of
france
on
his
spear
even
singly
such
men
were
almost
a
match
for
both

and
crown
but
when
joined
in
a
league
especially
if
allied
to
one
of
the
great
feudatories
such
as
the
duke
of
normandy
they
felt
sure
of
victory
one
day
when
eudes
count
of
corbeil
was
to
join
this
very
hugh
he
put
aside

immediate

of

was
to
carry
numbers
of

petty
princes
to

or
ruined

in
the

of

his
absorption
of
the

of

a
good
illustration
of

broken
down
by
the

of

and
by
the
vexation
of
many

and

stricken
at

at

escaping
down

abandoned

his

a

as
his

the

almost
at

rejoiced

whose
treachery
and
wicked
fraud
i
have
never
known
peace
and
yet
the
destruction
of
the
local
nobility
in
syria
was
the
least
important
part
of
the
social
revolution
wrought
by
the
crusades
for
though
the
power
of
the
barons
might
have
thus
been
temporarily
broken
they
could
never
have
been
reduced
to
impotence
unless
wealth
had
grown
equal
to
organizing
an
overwhelming
attack
the
accumulation
of
wealth
followed
the
opening
of
the
eastern
trade
and
its

effect
was
to

north

of

centred
in

county
of

whose
fairs
became
the
great
market
of

the

abbey
of
fifty
years
later
such
mentions
had
grown
frequent
and
by
the
year
the
fairs
had
attained
their
full
development
weaving
had
been
an
industry
in
flanders
under
the
romans
and
in
the
time
of
charlemagne
the
cloth
of
the
low
countries
had
been
famous
but
in
the
twelfth
century
the
manufacture
spread
into
the
adjoining
provinces
of
france
and
woollen
became
the
most
valuable
european
export
the
fleeces
were
brought
chiefly
from
england
the
weaving
was
done
on
the
continent
and
one
of
the
sources
of
the
florentine
wealth
was
the
dressing
and
dyeing
of
these
fabrics
to
prepare
them
for
the
asiatic
market
for
mutual
defence
the
industrial
towns
of
the
north
formed
a
league
called
the
hanse
of
london
because
london
was
the
seat
of
the
chief
this
league
at
first
included
only
seventeen
cities
with
ypres
and
bruges
at
the
head
but
the
association
afterward
increased
to
fifty
or
sixty
stretching
as
far
west
as
le
mans
as
far
south
as
the
burgundian
frontier
and
as
far
east
as
liège
exclusive
of
the
royal
domain
which
was
well
consolidated
under
philip
augustus
the
french
portion
of
this
region
substantially
comprised
the
counties
of
blois
vermandois
anjou
champagne
and
the
duchy
of
normandy
this
district
which
has
ever
since
formed
the
core
of
france
became
centralized
at
paris
between
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
philip
augustus
in
and
the
reign
of
philip
the
fair
a
century
later
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
this
centralization
was
the
effect
of
the
accumulation
of
capital
which
created
a
permanent
police
the
merchants
of
all
the
cities
of
the
league
bound
themselves
to
trade
exclusively
at
the
fairs
of
champagne
and
to
prosper
the
first
obstacle
they
had
to
overcome
was
the
difficulty
and
cost
of
transportation
not
only
were
the
roads
unsafe
because
of
the
strength
of
the
castles
in
which
the
predatory
nobility
lived
but
the
multiplicity
of
jurisdictions
added
to
taxes
as
late
as
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
a
convention
was
made
between
fifteen
of
the
more
important
italian
cities
such
as
florence
genoa
venice
and
milan
and
otho
of
burgundy
by
which
in
consideration
of
protection
upon
the
roads
tolls
were
to
be
paid
at
gevry
dôle
augerans
salins
chalamont
and
pontarlier
when
six
imposts
were
levied
for
crossing
a
single
duchy
the
cost
of
importing
the
cheaper
goods
must
have
been
prohibitory
the
italian
caravans
reached
champagne
ordinarily
by
two
routes
one
by
some
alpine
pass
to
geneva
and
then
through
burgundy
the
other
by
water
to
marseilles
or
up
the
rhone
to
lyons
and
north
substantially
as
before
the
towns
of
provins
troyes
and
lie
about
midway
between
bruges
and
ypres
on
the
one
side
and
lyons
and
geneva
on
the
other
and
it
was
at
these
cities
that
exchanges
centralized
until
the
introduction
of
the
mariner
s
compass
caused
traffic
to
go
by
the
ocean
and
made
antwerp
the
monied
metropolis
the
market
was
in
reality
open
continuously
for
six
fairs
were
held
each
six
weeks
long
and
the
trade
was
so
lucrative
that
places
which
in
had
been
petty
villages
in
had
wealth
enough
to
build
those
magnificent
cathedrals
which
are
still
wonders
of
the
world
the
communal
movement
had
nothing
about
it
necessarily
either
liberal
or
democratic
the
incorporated
borough
was
merely
an
instrument
of
trade
and
at
a
certain
moment
became
practically
independent
because
for
a
short
period
traders
organized
locally
before
they
could
amalgamate
into
centralized
communities
with
a
revenue
sufficient
to
pay
a
police
capable
of
coercing
individuals
what
the
merchant
wanted
was
protection
for
trade
and
provided
he
had
it
the
form
in
which
it
came
was
immaterial
where
the
feudal
government
was
strong
communes
did
not
exist
paris
never
had
a
charter
conversely
where
the
government
was
weak
communes
grew
up
because
traders
combined
for
mutual
protection
and
therefore
the
communes
reached
perfection
in
ecclesiastical
capitals
as
a
whole
the
secular
nobility
rather
favoured
the
incorporated
towns
because
they
could
sell
to
them
their
services
as
policemen
and
could
join
with
them
in
plundering
the
church
on
their
side
the
tradesmen
were
always
ready
to
commute
personal
military
service
into
a
tax
and
thus
both
sides
benefited
to
the
church
on
the
contrary
the
rise
of
the
mercantile
class
was
pure
loss
not
only
because
it
caused
their
vassals
to
seek
better
protection
than
ecclesiastics
could
give
but
because
the
propagation
of
the
materialistic
mind
bred
heresy
the
clergy
had
no
police
to
sell
and
the
townsmen
had
therefore
either
to
do
the
work
themselves
or
hire
a
secular
noble
in
the
one
case
they
became
substantially
independent
in
the
other
they
transferred
their
allegiance
to
a
stranger
in
any
event
a
new
fief
was
carved
out
of
an
ecclesiastical
lordship
and
such
accessions
steadily
built
up
the
royal
domain
from
the
outset
the
sacred
class
seems
to
have
been
conscious
of
its
danger
and
some
of
the
most
ferocious
wars
of
the
middle
ages
were
those
waged
upon
ecclesiastical
serfs
who
tried
to
organize
for
in
one
of
his
books
luchaire
has
told
at
length
the
story
of
the
massacre
of
the
peasantry
of
the
laonnais
by
a
soldier
whom
the
chapter
of
laon
elected
bishop
for
the
purpose
and
this
was
but
a
single
case
out
of
hundreds
hardly
a
bishop
or
an
abbot
lived
at
peace
with
his
vassals
and
as
the
clergy
were
the
natural
prey
of
the
secular
nobility
the
barons
often
sided
with
the
populace
and
used
the
burghers
as
an
excuse
for
private
war
a
speech
made
by
one
of
the
counts
of
nevers
during
a
rising
of
the
inhabitants
of
vézelay
gives
a
good
idea
of
the
intrigues
which
kept
the
prelates
in
perpetual
misery
o
very
illustrious
men
celebrated
for
great
wisdom
valiant
by
your
strength
and
rich
by
the
riches
you
have
acquired
by
your
own
merit
i
am
deeply
afflicted
at
the
miserable
condition
to
which
you
are
reduced
apparently
the
possessors
of
much
in
reality
you
are
masters
of
nothing
and
more
than
this
you
do
not
enjoy
any
portion
of
your
natural
liberty
if
i
think
on
these
things
i
am
greatly
astonished
and
ask
myself
what
has
become
of
or
rather
to
what
depth
of
cowardice
has
fallen
within
you
that
vigour
formerly
so
renowned
when
you
put
to
death
your
lord
the
abbot
the
count
then
dwelt
upon
the
harshness
of
the
living
abbot
and
ended
thus
separate
from
this
man
and
bind
yourselves
to
me
by
a
mutual
agreement
if
you
consent
i
engage
myself
to
free
you
from
all
exactions
from
all
illegal
rentals
and
to
defend
you
from
the
evils
which
are
ready
to
fall
upon
wherever
developed
the
mercantile
mind
had
always
the
same
characteristic
it
was
unimaginative
and
being
unimaginative
it
doubted
the
utility
of
magic
accordingly
all
commercial
communities
have
rebelled
against
paying
for
miracles
and
it
was
the
spread
of
a
scepticism
already
well
developed
in
the
thirteenth
century
among
the
manufacturing
towns
which
caused
the
reformation
of
the
sixteenth
at
the
monks
carried
the
relics
of
saint
vigor
each
year
in
procession
in
the
burghers
took
a
dead
cat
and
put
it
in
a
shrine
while
in
another
casket
they
placed
a
to
do
service
as
the
arm
of
saint
vigor
when
the
procession
reached
a
certain
spot
the
reliquaries
were
set
down
and
a
mock
fight
began
between
two
mummers
then
the
bearers
cried
out
old
saint
riquier
you
shall
go
no
further
unless
you
reconcile
these
enemies
whereupon
the
combatants
fell
into
each
other
s
arms
and
all
cried
out
that
saint
riquier
had
wrought
a
miracle
afterward
they
built
a
chapel
and
oratory
with
an
altar
draped
with
cloth
of
gold
and
deposited
the
dead
cat
and
the
and
simple
pilgrims
ignorant
of
the
sacrilege
stopped
to
worship
the
relics
the
mayor
and
council
aiding
and
abetting
the
crime
to
the
detriment
of
the
whole
church
the
clergy
retaliated
with
frightful
ferocity
as
heresy
followed
in
the
wake
of
trade
the
inquisition
followed
in
the
wake
of
heresy
and
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
witnessed
simultaneously
the
prosperity
of
the
mercantile
class
and
the
organization
of
the
holy
office
jacques
de
vitry
breathed
the
ecclesiastical
spirit
one
of
the
most
famous
preachers
of
his
age
he
rose
from
a
simple
monk
to
be
of
tusculum
legate
in
france
and
patriarch
of
jerusalem
he
led
a
crusade
against
the
albigenses
was
present
at
the
siege
of
damietta
and
died
at
rome
in
his
sermons
burn
with
his
hatred
of
the
bourgeoisie
that
detestable
race
of
men
hurrying
to
meet
its
fate
which
none
or
few
could
escape
all
of
whom
were
making
haste
toward
hell
but
above
all
other
evils
of
these
babylonish
cities
there
is
one
which
is
the
worst
for
hardly
is
there
a
community
to
be
found
in
which
there
are
not
abettors
receivers
defenders
of
or
believers
in
the
basis
of
the
secular
society
of
the
early
middle
ages
was
individual
physical
force
every
layman
noble
or
serf
owed
military
service
and
when
a
borough
was
incorporated
it
took
its
place
in
the
feudal
hierarchy
like
any
other
vassal
with
the
spread
of
the
mercantile
type
however
a
change
began
the
transmutation
of
physical
force
into
money
and
this
process
went
on
until
individual
strength
or
courage
ceased
to
have
importance
as
soldiers
the
burgesses
never
excelled
citizen
troops
have
seldom
been
formidable
and
those
of
the
communes
rarely
withstood
the
first
onset
of
the
enemy
the
tradesmen
themselves
recognized
their
own
limitations
and
in
the
deputies
of
the
cities
met
at
paris
and
requested
the
government
to
undertake
the
administration
of
the
local
militia
though
unwarlike
the
townsmen
were
wealthy
and
in
the
reign
of
philip
augustus
the
same
cause
which
led
to
the
consolidation
of
the
kingdom
brought
about
as
luchaire
has
pointed
out
a
radical
modification
of
the
military
and
financial
organization
of
the
monarchy
the
substitution
by
the
privileged
corporations
of
money
payments
for
personal
service
thus
from
the
time
when
the
economic
type
had
multiplied
sufficiently
to
hire
a
police
the
strength
of
the
state
came
to
depend
on
its
revenue
and
financiers
grew
to
be
the
controlling
element
of
civilization
before
the
crusades
the
high
offices
of
the
kingdom
of
france
such
as
the
office
of
the
seneschal
were
not
only
held
by
nobles
but
tended
to
become
hereditary
in
certain
warlike
families
after
the
rise
of
the
eastern
trade
the
royal
council
was
captured
by
the
bourgeoisie
jacques
cœur
is
a
striking
specimen
of
the
class
which
ruled
in
the
fifteenth
century
of
this
class
the
lawyers
were
the
spokesmen
and
men
like
flotte
and
nogaret
the
chancellors
of
philip
the
fair
expressed
the
notion
of
centralization
as
perfectly
as
the
jurists
of
ancient
rome
no
one
has
understood
the
movement
better
than
luchaire
he
has
pointed
out
in
his
work
on
french
institutions
that
from
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
saint
louis
the
privy
council
steadily
gained
in
consequence
the
permanent
civil
service
of
which
it
was
the
core
served
as
a
school
for
judges
clerks
seneschals
and
all
judicial
and
executive
officers
at
first
the
administration
retained
a
strong
clerical
tinge
probably
because
a
generation
elapsed
before
laymen
could
be
equally
well
trained
for
the
work
but
after
the
accession
of
philip
the
fair
toward
the
end
of
the
century
the
laymen
decisively
predominated
and
when
they
predominated
the
plunder
of
the
church
began
abstract
justice
is
of
course
impossible
law
is
merely
the
expression
of
the
will
of
the
strongest
for
the
time
being
and
therefore
laws
have
no
fixity
but
shift
from
generation
to
generation
when
the
imagination
is
vivid
and
police
weak
emotional
or
ecclesiastical
law
prevails
as
competition
sharpens
and
the
movement
of
society
accelerates
religious
ritual
is
supplanted
by
civil
codes
for
the
enforcement
of
contracts
and
the
protection
of
the
creditor
class
the
more
society
consolidates
the
more
legislation
is
controlled
by
the
wealthy
and
at
length
the
representatives
of
the
monied
class
acquire
that
absolute
power
once
wielded
by
the
roman
proconsul
and
now
exercised
by
the
modern
magistrate
the
two
great
figures
of
saint
louis
and
of
philip
the
fair
which
dominate
the
third
period
are
profoundly
unlike
but
considering
the
facts
as
a
whole
they
have
but
moderately
influenced
the
direction
of
the
communal
development
with
the
bailiffs
and
parliament
the
monarchical
machine
is
in
possession
of
its
essential
works
it
operates
and
will
stop
no
more
in
vain
the
king
shall
essay
to
arrest
its
march
or
to
direct
it
in
another
course
the
innumerable
army
of
agents
of
the
crown
does
not
cease
for
a
moment
to
destroy
rival
jurisdictions
to
suppress
embarrassing
powers
to
replace
everywhere
private
jurisdictions
by
the
single
authority
of
the
sovereign
to
the
infinite
diversity
of
local
liberties
its
will
is
to
substitute
regularity
of
institutions
political
and
administrative
as
luchaire
has
elsewhere
observed
the
current
everywhere
substituted
in
the
paths
of
administration
justice
and
finance
the
lay
and
burgher
for
the
ecclesiastical
and
noble
in
other
words
the
economic
type
steadily
gained
ground
and
the
process
went
on
until
the
revolution
saint
simon
never
forgave
louis
xiv
for
surrounding
himself
with
men
of
mean
birth
dependent
on
his
will
the
duke
of
beauvilliers
was
the
single
example
in
the
whole
course
of
his
reign
as
has
been
remarked
in
speaking
of
this
duke
the
only
nobleman
who
was
admitted
into
his
council
between
the
death
of
cardinal
mazarin
and
his
own
that
is
to
say
during
from
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
to
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
was
an
interval
of
almost
unparalleled
commercial
prosperity
a
prosperity
which
is
sufficiently
proved
by
the
sumptuous
quality
of
the
architecture
of
the
time
unquestionably
the
most
magnificent
buildings
of
modern
europe
date
from
this
period
and
this
prosperity
was
not
limited
to
any
country
but
extended
from
cairo
to
london
such
an
expansion
of
trade
would
have
been
impossible
without
a
corresponding
expansion
of
the
currency
and
as
no
new
mines
were
discovered
recourse
was
had
to
paper
by
the
year
bills
of
exchange
had
been
introduced
and
in
order
to
give
the
bill
of
exchange
its
greatest
circulating
power
a
system
of
banking
was
created
which
operated
as
a
universal
clearing
house
and
by
means
of
which
these
bills
were
balanced
against
each
other
in
the
thirteenth
century
florence
genoa
and
venice
were
the
chief
monied
centres
in
these
cities
the
purchase
and
sale
of
commercial
paper
was
at
the
outset
monopolized
by
a
body
of
who
in
venice
at
least
seem
to
have
been
controlled
by
the
council
of
merchants
and
who
probably
were
not
always
in
the
best
credit
at
all
events
they
were
required
in
to
make
a
deposit
of
as
security
for
their
customers
and
afterward
the
amount
was
increased
possibly
some
such
system
of
deposits
may
have
originally
formed
the
capital
of
the
bank
of
venice
but
everything
relating
to
the
organization
of
the
mediæval
banks
is
obscure
all
that
seems
certain
is
that
business
was
conducted
by
establishments
of
this
character
long
before
the
date
of
any
records
which
now
remain
amidst
the
multiplicity
of
mediæval
jurisdictions
not
only
did
the
currency
become
involved
in
inextricable
confusion
but
it
generally
was
debased
through
abrasion
and
clipping
before
clearings
could
be
conveniently
made
therefore
a
coinage
of
recognized
value
had
to
be
provided
and
this
the
banks
undertook
to
supply
by
their
system
of
deposits
they
received
coin
fresh
from
the
mints
for
which
they
gave
credits
and
these
credits
or
notes
were
negotiable
and
were
always
to
be
bought
in
the
market
the
deposits
themselves
were
seldom
withdrawn
as
they
bore
a
premium
over
common
currency
which
they
lost
when
put
in
circulation
and
they
were
accordingly
only
transferred
on
the
books
of
the
corporations
to
correspond
with
the
sales
of
the
notes
which
represented
them
thus
merchants
from
all
parts
of
europe
and
the
levant
could
draw
on
venice
or
genoa
and
have
their
balances
settled
by
transfers
of
deposits
at
the
banks
without
the
intervention
of
coin
a
calculation
has
been
made
that
by
this
means
the
effective
power
of
the
currency
was
multiplied
tenfold
of
all
these
institutions
the
corporations
of
genoa
and
venice
were
the
most
famous
the
bank
of
saint
george
at
genoa
was
formally
organized
in
but
it
undoubtedly
had
conducted
business
from
the
beginning
of
the
twelfth
century
next
to
nothing
is
known
of
the
development
at
venice
probably
however
florence
was
more
purely
a
monied
centre
than
either
venice
or
genoa
and
no
of
the
middle
ages
ever
equalled
the
great
florentine
banking
families
most
of
the
important
commercial
centres
came
to
have
institutions
of
the
kind
the
introduction
of
credit
had
the
same
effect
as
a
large
addition
to
the
stock
of
bullion
and
as
gold
and
silver
grew
more
plentiful
their
relative
value
fell
and
a
general
reform
of
the
currency
took
place
venice
began
the
movement
with
the
grosso
it
spread
through
italy
and
into
france
and
the
coin
of
saint
louis
was
long
considered
as
perfect
money
with
the
expansion
of
the
currency
went
a
rise
in
prices
all
producers
grew
rich
and
for
more
than
two
generations
the
strain
of
competition
was
so
relaxed
that
the
different
classes
of
the
population
preyed
upon
each
other
less
savagely
than
they
are
wont
to
do
in
less
happy
times
meanwhile
no
considerable
additions
were
made
to
the
volume
of
the
precious
metals
and
as
the
bulk
of
commerce
swelled
the
capacity
of
the
new
system
of
credit
became
exhausted
and
contraction
set
in
the
first
symptom
of
disorder
seems
to
have
been
a
rise
in
the
purchasing
power
of
both
the
precious
metals
but
particularly
of
gold
which
rose
in
its
ratio
to
silver
from
about
one
to
nine
and
a
half
to
one
to
twelve
at
the
same
time
the
value
of
commodities
even
when
measured
in
silver
appears
to
have
fallen
sharply
the
consequence
of
this
fall
was
a
corresponding
addition
to
the
burden
of
debt
and
a
very
general
insolvency
the
communes
had
been
large
borrowers
and
their
straits
were
deplorable
luchaire
has
described
their
condition
as
shown
in
the
municipal
accounts
addressed
by
the
communes
to
the
everywhere
there
was
a
deficit
almost
everywhere
ruin
amiens
soissons
roye
saint
quentin
and
rouen
were
all
in
difficulty
with
their
loans
but
noyon
was
perhaps
the
worst
of
all
in
noyon
owed
pounds
which
it
was
unable
to
pay
after
a
suspension
for
fourteen
years
the
king
issued
an
ordinance
regulating
liquidation
a
part
of
the
claims
had
to
be
cancelled
and
the
balance
collected
by
a
levy
on
private
property
the
bankruptcy
was
complete
the
royal
government
equally
hardly
pressed
was
unable
to
meet
its
obligations
in
the
standard
coin
and
resorted
to
debasement
under
saint
louis
the
mark
of
silver
yielded
but
pounds
sous
pence
in
the
same
weight
of
metal
was
cut
into
pounds
sous
the
pressure
upon
the
population
was
terrible
and
led
to
terrible
results
the
beginning
of
the
spoliation
of
the
emotionalists
perhaps
the
combination
of
the
two
great
forces
of
the
age
of
the
soldier
and
the
monk
was
the
supreme
effort
of
the
emotional
mind
what
a
hold
the
dazzling
dream
of
omnipotence
through
the
possession
of
the
sepulchre
had
upon
the
twelfth
century
can
be
measured
by
the
gifts
showered
upon
the
crusading
orders
for
they
represented
a
prodigious
sacrifice
at
paris
the
temple
had
a
capital

against
the
capital
of
the
king
within
a
walled
enclosure
of
sixty
thousand
square
metres
stood
the
conventual
buildings
and
a
gigantic
donjon
of
such
perfect
masonry
that
it
never
needed
other
repairs
than
the
patching
of
its
roof
beyond
the
walls
the
domain
extended
to
the
seine
a
property
which
even
in
had
an
almost
incalculable
value
on
every
eastern
and
at
every
assault
and
siege
the
knights
had
fought
with
that
fiery
courage
which
has
made
their
name
a
proverb
down
to
the
present
day
in
at
safed
three
hundred
had
been
butchered
upon
the
ramparts
in
cold
blood
rather
than
renounce
their
faith

whose
loss
sealed
the
fate
of
palestine
they
held
the

at
all

until
the

fell
burying

grave
but
skill
and
valour
avail
nothing
against

step
by
step
the
templars
had
been
driven
back
until
tortosa
surrendered
in
then
the
holy
land
was
closed
the
enthusiasm
which
had
generated
the
order
had
passed
away
and
meanwhile
economic
competition
had
bred
a
new
race
at
home
to
which
monks
were
a
predestined
prey
in
as
the
latin
kingdom
in
syria
was
tottering
towards
its
fall
philip
the
fair
was
crowned
subtle
sceptical
treacherous
and
cruel
few
kings
have
left
behind
them
a
more
sombre
memory
yet
he
was
the
incarnation
of
the
economic
spirit
in
its
conflict
with
the
church
nine
years
later
benedetto
gaetani
was
elected
pope
a
man
as
completely
the
creation
of
the
social
revolution
of
the
thirteenth
century
as
philip
himself
trained
at
bologna
and
paris
a
jurist
rather
than
a
priest
his
faith
in
dogma
was
so
scanty
that
his
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
has
been
questioned
a
thorough
worldling
greedy
ambitious
and
unscrupulous
he
was
suspected
of
having
murdered
his
predecessor
celestin
when
boniface
came
to
the
throne
the
church
is
supposed
to
have
owned
about
of
the
soil
of
europe
and
on
this
property
the
governments
had
no
means
of
enforcing
regular
taxation
toward
the
close
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
fall
of
prices
increased
the
weight
of
debt
while
it
diminished
the
power
of
the
population
to
pay
on
the
other
hand
as
the
system
of
administration
became
more
complex
the
cost
of
government
augmented
and
at
last
the
burden
became
more
than
the
laity
could
endure
both
england
and
france
had
a
permanent
deficit
and
edward
and
philip
alike
turned
toward
the
clergy
as
the
only
source
of
supply
both
kings
met
with
opposition
but
the
explosion
came
in
france
where
clairvaux
the
most
intractable
of
convents
appealed
to
rome
boniface
had
been
elected
by
a
coalition
between
the
colonna
and
the
orsini
factions
but
after
his
coronation
he
turned
upon
the
colonnas
who
in
revenge
plundered
his
treasure
a
struggle
followed
which
ended
fatally
to
the
pope
but
at
first
he
had
the
advantage
sacked
their
city
of
præneste
and
forced
them
to
fly
to
france
on
the
brink
of
this
war
boniface
was
in
no
condition
to
rouse
so
dangerous
an
adversary
as
philip
and
in
answer
to
clairvaux
s
appeal
he
confined
himself
to
excommunicating
the
prince
who
should
tax
the
priest
and
the
priest
who
should
pay
the
impost
nevertheless
the
issue
had
to
be
met
the
church
had
weakened
as
terror
of
the
unknown
had
waned
and
could
no
longer
defend
its
wealth
which
was
destined
to
pass
more
and
more
completely
into
the
hands
of
the
laity
philip
continued
his
aggressions
and
when
peace
had
been
established
in
italy
the
rupture
came
not
realizing
his
impotence
and
exasperated
at
the
royal
policy
boniface
sent
bernard
de
saisset
bishop
of
pamiers
to
paris
as
his
ambassador
bernard
had
recently
been
consecrated
in
defiance
of
philip
and
they
were
bitter
enemies
he
was
soon
dismissed
from
court
but
he
continued
his
provocations
calling
the
king
a
false
coiner
and
a
blockhead
and
when
he
returned
to
pamiers
he
plotted
an
insurrection
he
was
arrested
and
prosecuted
by
the
chancellor
flotte
but
when
delivered
to
the
archbishop
of
narbonne
for
degradation
action
was
suspended
to
await
the
sanction
of
rome
then
flotte
was
sent
to
italy
to
demand
the
surrender
of
the
child
of
perdition
that
philip
might
make
of
him
an
excellent
sacrifice
to
the
mission
necessarily
failed
for
it
was
a
struggle
for
supremacy
and
the
issue
was
well
summed
up
in
the
final
words
of
the
stormy
interview
which
brought
it
to
a
close
my
power
the
spiritual
power
cried
boniface
embraces
and
encloses
the
true
retorted
flotte
but
yours
is
verbal
the
king
s
is
an
ecclesiastical
council
was
convoked
for
october
and
philip
was
summoned
to
appear
before
the
greatest
prelates
of
christendom
but
not
waiting
the
meeting
of
this
august
assembly
boniface
on
december
launched
his
famous
bull
ausculta
fili
which
was
his
declaration
of
war
listen
my
son
do
not
persuade
yourself
that
you
have
no
superior
and
are
not
in
subjection
to
the
head
of
the
ecclesiastical
hierarchy
he
who
says
this
is
mad
he
who
sustains
it
is
an
infidel
you
devour
the
revenues
of
the
vacant
bishoprics
you
pillage
churches
i
do
not
speak
now
of
the
alterations
in
the
coinage
and
of
the
other
complaints
which
arise
on
all
sides
and
which
cry
to
us
against
you
but
not
to
make
myself
accountable
to
god
for
your
soul
i
summon
you
to
appear
before
me
and
in
case
of
your
refusal
shall
render
judgment
in
your
absence
a
century
before
the
barons
of
france
had
abandoned
philip
augustus
through
fear
of
the
incantations
of
innocent
but
in
the
third
generation
of
the
commercial
type
such
fears
had
been
discarded
in
april
the
estates
of
the
realm
sustained
the
little
heretic
as
boniface
called
flotte
in
burning
the
papal
bull
and
in
answering
the
admonitions
of
the
pope
with
mockery
philip
by
the
grace
of
god
king
of
the
french
to
boniface
who
calls
himself
sovereign
pontiff
little
greeting
or
none
let
your
very
great
foolishness
know
that
we
are
subject
to
no
one
for
the
temporalty
that
the
collation
to
the
vacant
churches
and
prebends
belongs
to
us
by
royal
right
that
their
fruits
are
ours
that
collations
which
have
been
made
or
are
to
be
made
by
us
are
valid
for
the
past
and
for
the
future
and
that
we
will
manfully
protect
their
possessors
against
all
comers
those
who
think
otherwise
we
hold
fools
or
the
accepted
theory
long
was
that
the
bourgeoisie
were
neutral
in
this
quarrel
that
they
were
an
insignificant
factor
in
the
state
and
obeyed
passively
because
they
were
without
the
power
to
oppose
in
reality
consolidation
had
already
gone
so
far
that
money
had
become
the
prevailing
form
of
force
in
the
kingdom
of
france
therefore
the
monied
class
was
on
the
whole
the
strongest
class
and
flotte
was
their
mouthpiece
they
accepted
the
papers
drawn
by
the
chancellor
because
the
chancellor
was
their
representative
in
july
philip
met
with
the
defeat
of
courtray
and
the
tone
of
the
ecclesiastical
council
convened
in
october
shows
that
the
clergy
thought
his
power
broken
a
priest
relies
upon
the
miracle
and
if
defied
he
must
either
conquer
by
supernatural
aid
or
submit
to
secular
coercion
boniface
boldly
faced
the
issue
and
planted
himself
by
hildebrand
in
his
bull
unam
sanctam
he
defined
his
claim
to
the
implicit
obedience
of
laymen
we
are
provided
under
his
authority
with
two
swords
the
temporal
and
the
spiritual
both
therefore
are
in
the
power
of
the
church
to
wit
the
spiritual
and
the
material
sword
the
one
is
to
be
used
by
the
priest
the
other
by
kings
and
soldiers
sed
ad
nutum
et
patientiam
a
sentence
of
excommunication
had
also
been
prepared
and
sent
to
france
which
was
to
have
been
followed
by
deposition
but
when
it
arrived
philip
convened
an
assembly
of
prelates
and
barons
at
the
louvre
and
presented
an
indictment
against
boniface
probably
without
a
parallel
in
modern
history
the
pope
was
accused
of
every
crime
he
was
an
infidel
a
denier
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
a
scoffer
at
the
eucharist
a
murderer
and
a
sorcerer
he
was
guilty
of
unnatural
crimes
and
of
robbery
the
bearer
of
the
bull
was
arrested
the
property
of
the
bishops
who
had
attended
the
council
sequestered
and
philip
prepared
to
seize
boniface
in
his
own
palace
boniface
too
felt
the
decisive
hour
at
hand
he
tried
to
reconcile
himself
with
his
enemies
drew
the
bull
of
deposition
and
prepared
to
affix
it
to
the
church
door
at
anagni
on
september
before
the
day
came
he
was
a
prisoner
and
face
to
face
with
death
flotte
had
been
killed
at
courtray
and
had
been
succeeded
by
the
redoubtable
nogaret
whose
grandfather
was
believed
to
have
been
burned
as
a
heretic
with
nogaret
philip
joined
sciarra
colonna
the
bloodiest
of
the
italian
nobles
and
sent
them
together
to
italy
to
deal
with
his
foe
boniface
had
made
war
upon
the
colonnas
and
sciarra
had
been
hunted
like
a
wild
beast
flying
disguised
he
had
been
taken
by
pirates
and
had
preferred
to
toil
four
years
as
a
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
ecclesiastical
mercy
by
surrendering
himself
to
the
vicar
of
christ
at
last
philip
heard
of
his
misfortunes
bought
him
and
at
the
crisis
let
him
slip
like
a
mad
dog
at
the
old
man
s
throat
nogaret
and
colonna
succeeded
in
corrupting
the
governor
of
anagni
and
entered
the
town
at
dead
of
night
but
the
pope
s
nephews
had
time
to
barricade
the
streets
and
it
was
not
until
the
church
which
communicated
with
the
papal
apartments
had
been
fired
that
the
palace
was
forced
there
it
was
said
they
found
the
proud
old
priest
sitting
upon
his
throne
with
his
crown
upon
his
head
and
men
whispered
that
as
he
sat
there
colonna
struck
him
in
the
face
with
his
gauntlet
probably
the
story
was
false
but
it
reflected
truly
enough
the
spirit
of
the
pope
s
captors
he
himself
believed
them
capable
of
poisoning
him
for
from
saturday
night
till
monday
morning
he
lay
without
food
or
drink
and
when
liberated
was
exhausted
boniface
was
and
the
shock
killed
him
he
was
taken
to
rome
and
died
there
of
fever
according
to
the
rumour
blaspheming
and
gnawing
his
hands
in
frenzy
the
death
of
boniface
was
decisive
benedict
who
succeeded
him
did
not
attempt
to
prolong
the
contest
but
peace
without
surrender
was
impossible
the
economic
classes
held
the
emotionalists
by
the
throat
and
strangled
them
till
they
disgorged
vainly
benedict
revoked
the
acts
of
his
predecessor
philip
demanded
that
boniface
should
be
branded
as
a
heretic
and
sent
nogaret
to
rome
as
his
ambassador
the
insult
was
more
than
the
priesthood
could
yet
endure
summoning
his
courage
benedict
excommunicated
nogaret
colonna
and
thirteen
others
whom
he
had
seen
break
into
the
palace
at
anagni
within
a
month
he
was
dead
poison
was
whispered
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
monks
captured
the
papacy
the
hierarchy
was
paralyzed
by
fear
no
complaint
was
made
or
pursuit
of
the
criminal
attempted
the
consistory
met
but
failed
to
unite
on
a
successor
according
to
the
legend
when
the
cardinals
were
unable
to
agree
the
faction
opposed
to
philip
consented
to
name
three
candidates
from
whom
the
king
should
select
the
pope
the
prelate
he
chose
was
bertrand
de
goth
archbishop
of
bordeaux
boniface
had
been
his
patron
but
philip
who
knew
men
knew
that
this
man
had
his
price
the
tale
goes
that
the
king
visited
the
bishop
at
an
abbey
near
angély
and
began
the
conversation
as
follows
my
lord
archbishop
i
have
that
in
my
hand
will
make
you
pope
if
i
like
and
it
is
for
that
i
am
bertrand
fell
on
his
knees
and
the
king
imposed
five
conditions
reserving
a
sixth
to
exact
thereafter
the
last
condition
was
the
condemnation
of
the
templars
doubtless
the
picturesque
old
tale
is
as
false
in
detail
as
it
is
true
in
spirit
probably
no
such
interview
took
place
and
yet
there
seems
little
doubt
that
clement
owed
his
election
to
philip
and
gave
pledges
which
bound
him
from
the
day
of
his
coronation
certainly
he
surrendered
all
liberty
of
action
for
he
established
himself
at
avignon
whence
the
battlements
of
can
still
be
seen
built
by
philip
to
overawe
the
town
within
an
hour
he
could
have
filled
the
streets
with
his
mercenaries
the
victory
was
complete
the
church
was
prostrate
and
spoliation
began
clement
was
crowned
in
and
after
two
years
of
slavery
he
began
to
find
his
compact
heavy
upon
him
he
yielded
up
the
patronage
he
consented
to
the
taxation
of
the
clergy
and
he
ordered
the
of
the
crusading
orders
to
return
to
europe
all
at
philip
s
bidding
but
when
he
was
commanded
to
condemn
boniface
as
a
heretic
he
recoiled
in
terror
indeed
to
have
rejected
boniface
as
an
impostor
and
a
false
pope
would
have
precipitated
chaos
his
bishops
and
cardinals
would
have
been
set
aside
clement
s
own
election
would
have
been
invalidated
none
could
foresee
where
the
disorganization
would
end
to
gain
time
clement
pleaded
for
a
general
council
which
the
king
morosely
conceded
but
only
on
the
condition
that
the
excommunications
against
his
agents
even
against
nogaret
should
be
withdrawn
clement
assented
for
he
was
practically
a
prisoner
at
poitiers
a
council
at
vienne
was
agreed
to
and
the
crown
seized
the
templars
without
opposition
from
the
church
criticism
has
long
ago
dispelled
the
mystery
which
once
shrouded
this
bloody
process
no
historian
now
suggests
that
the
knights
were
really
guilty
of
the
fantastic
enormities
charged
against
them
and
which
they
confessed
under
torture
scepticism
doubtless
was
rife
among
them
as
it
was
among
the
cardinals
but
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
the
worst
differed
materially
from
the
population
about
them
and
the
superb
fortitude
with
which
they
perished
demonstrates
that
lack
of
religious
enthusiasm
was
not
the
crime
for
which
they
died
when
philip
conceived
the
idea
of
first
murdering
and
then
plundering
the
crusaders
is
uncertain
some
have
thought
it
was
in
while
sheltered
in
the
temple
when
he
having
suddenly
raised
his
debased
money
to
the
standard
of
saint
louis
the
mob
destroyed
the
house
of
his
master
of
the
mint
probably
it
was
much
earlier
and
was
but
the
necessary
result
of
the
sharpening
of
economic
competition
which
began
with
the
accelerated
movement
accompanying
the
crusades
after
clement
s
election
several
years
elapsed
before
the
scheme
ripened
nothing
could
be
done
until
one
or
both
of
the
had
been
enticed
to
france
with
their
treasure
under
pretence
of
preparing
for
a
new
crusade
this
was
finally
accomplished
and
in
jacques
de
molay
a
chivalrous
burgundian
gentleman
journeyed
unsuspectingly
to
paris
taking
with
him
his
chief
officers
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
florins
in
gold
beside
silver
enough
to
load
ten
philip
first
borrowed
all
the
money
de
molay
would
lend
and
then
at
one
sudden
swoop
arrested
in
a
single
night
all
the
templars
in
france
on
october
the
seizure
was
made
and
philip
s
organization
was
so
perfect
and
his
agents
so
reliable
that
the
plan
was
executed
with
precision
the
object
of
the
government
was
plunder
but
before
the
goods
of
the
order
could
be
confiscated
legal
conviction
of
some
crime
was
necessary
which
would
entail
forfeiture
heresy
was
the
only
accusation
adapted
to
the
purpose
accordingly
philip
determined
to
convict
the
knights
of
heresy
and
the
best
evidence
was
confession
to
extort
confession
the
inquisition
had
to
be
set
in
motion
by
the
pope
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
in
order
to
convey
to
the
laymen
the
property
of
ecclesiastics
christ
s
soldiers
were
tormented
to
death
by
his
own
vicar
in
vain
in
the
midst
of
the
work
clement
in
agonies
of
remorse
revoked
the
commissions
of
the
inquisitors
philip
jeered
when
the
cardinals
delivered
the
message
saying
that
god
hated
the
lukewarm
and
the
torture
went
on
as
before
when
he
had
extorted
what
he
needed
he
set
out
for
poitiers
clement
fled
but
was
arrested
and
brought
back
a
prisoner
then
his
resolution
gave
way
and
he
abandoned
the
knights
to
their
fate
reserving
only
the
and
a
few
high
officials
for
himself
still
though
he
forsook
the
individuals
he
could
not
be
terrified
into
condemning
the
order
in
its
corporate
capacity
and
the
final
process
was
referred
to
the
approaching
council
meanwhile
a
commission
presided
over
by
the
archbishop
of
narbonne
proceeded
with
the
trial
of
the
knights
for
three
years
these
miserable
wretches
languished
in
their
dungeons
and
the
imagination
recoils
from
picturing
their
torments
finally
philip
felt
that
an
end
must
be
made
and
in
march
of
the
survivors
were
taken
from
their
prisons
and
made
to
choose
delegates
for
their
exasperation
was
so
deep
that
the
government
feared
to
let
them
appear
before
the
court
in
a
body
the
precaution
availed
little
for
the
knights
who
conducted
the
common
defence
proved
themselves
as
proud
and
bold
in
this
last
extremity
of
human
misery
as
they
had
ever
been
upon
the
day
of
battle
they
denied
the
charges
brought
against
them
they
taunted
their
judges
with
the
lies
told
them
to
induce
them
to
confess
and
they
showed
how
life
and
liberty
had
been
promised
them
under
the
royal
seal
if
they
would
admit
the
allegations
of
the
government
then
they
told
the
story
of
those
who
had
been
steadfast
to
the
end
it
is
not
astonishing
that
some
have
borne
false
witness
but
that
any
have
told
the
truth
considering
the
sorrows
and
suffering
the
threats
and
insults
they
daily
endure
what
is
surprising
is
that
faith
should
be
given
to
those
who
have
testified
untruly
to
save
their
bodies
rather
than
to
those
who
have
died
in
their
tortures
in
such
numbers
like
martyrs
of
christ
in
defence
of
the
truth
or
who
solely
for
conscience
sake
have
suffered
and
still
daily
suffer
in
their
prisons
so
many
torments
trials
calamities
and
miseries
for
this
the
witnesses
called
confirmed
their
statements
bernard
peleti
when
examined
was
asked
if
he
had
been
put
to
the
torture
he
replied
that
for
three
months
previous
to
his
confession
to
the
bishop
of
paris
he
had
lain
with
his
hands
so
tightly
bound
behind
his
back
that
the
blood
started
from
his
finger
nails
he
had
beside
been
put
in
a
pit
then
he
broke
out
if
i
am
tortured
i
shall
deny
all
i
have
said
now
and
shall
say
all
they
want
me
to
say
if
the
time
be
short
i
can
bear
to
be
beheaded
or
to
die
by
boiling
water
or
by
fire
for
the
honour
of
the
order
but
i
can
no
longer
withstand
the
torments
which
for
more
than
two
years
i
have
endured
in
i
have
been
tortured
three
times

quia

bernard
de
vado
showed
two
bones
which
had
dropped
from
his
heels
after
roasting
his
feet
such
testimony
was
disregarded
for
condemnation
was
necessary
as
a
preliminary
to
confiscation
the
suppression
of
the
temple
was
the
first
step
in
that
long
spoliation
of
the
church
which
has
continued
to
the
present
day
and
which
has
been
agonizing
to
the
victims
in
proportion
to
their
power
of
resistance
the
fourteenth
century
was
still
an
age
of
faith
and
the
monks
died
hard
philip
grasped
the
situation
with
the
intuition
of
genius
and
provided
himself
with
an
instrument
fit
for
the
task
before
him
he
forced
clement
to
raise
philip
de
marigni
to
the
see
of
sens
and
marigni
was
a
man
who
shrank
from
nothing
when
made
archbishop
he
convoked
a
provincial
council
at
paris
and
condemned
as
relapsed
heretics
the
knights
who
had
repudiated
their
confessions
of
these
knights
belonged
to
his
own
diocese
he
had
them
brought
to
a
fenced
enclosure
in
a
field
near
the
abbey
of
saint
antoine
and
there
offered
them
pardon
if
they
would
recant
then
they
were
chained
to
stakes
and
slowly
burned
to
ashes
from
the
feet
upward
not
one
flinched
but
amidst
shrieks
of
anguish
when
half
consumed
they
protested
their
innocence
and
died
imploring
mercy
of
christ
and
of
the
virgin
devotion
so
superb
might
have
fired
the
imagination
of
even
such
a
craven
as
clement
but
philip
was
equal
to
the
emergency
he
had
caused
scores
of
witnesses
to
be
examined
to
prove
that
boniface
was
a
murderer
a
sorcerer
a
debauchee
and
a
heretic
suddenly
he
offered
to
drop
the
prosecution
and
to
restore
the
temple
lands
to
the
church
if
the
order
might
be
abolished
and
the
process
closed
clement
yielded
in
october
the
council
met
at
vienne
the
winter
was
spent
in
intimidation
and
bribery
the
second
meeting
was
not
held
until
the
following
april
and
then
the
decree
of
suppression
was
published
by
this
decree
the
corporation
was
dissolved
but
certain
of
the
higher
officers
still
lived
and
in
an
evil
moment
clement
bethought
him
of
their
fate
in
december
he
appointed
a
commission
to
try
them
they
were
brought
before
a
lofty
scaffold
at
the
portal
of
the
cathedral
of
paris
and
there
made
to
reiterate
the
avowals
which
had
been
wrung
from
them
in
their
dungeons
then
they
were
sentenced
to
perpetual
imprisonment
but
at
this
supreme
moment
when
it
seemed
that
all
was
over
de
molay
the
and
the
master
of
normandy
broke
into
a
furious
defence
the
commissioners
adjourned
in
a
panic
but
philip
thirsting
for
blood
sprang
upon
his
prey
he
gave
his
orders
to
his
own
officers
without
consulting
any
prelate
on
march
as
night
fell
the
two
crusaders
were
taken
from
the
provost
who
acted
as
their
gaoler
and
carried
to
a
little
island
in
the
seine
on
which
a
statue
of
henry
of
navarre
now
stands
there
they
were
burned
together
without
a
trial
and
without
a
sentence
they
watched
the
building
of
their
funeral
pile
with
hearts
so
firm
and
resolute
and
persisted
with
such
constancy
in
their
denials
to
the
end
and
suffered
death
with
such
composure
that
they
left
the
witnesses
of
their
execution
in
admiration
and
an
ancient
legend
told
how
de
molay
as
he
stood
upon
his
blazing
fagots
summoned
clement
to
meet
him
before
god
s
in
forty
days
and
philip
within
a
year
neither
survived
the
interval
philip
had
promised
to
restore
the
goods
of
the
temple
to
the
church
but
the
plunder
for
which
this
tremendous
deed
was
done
was
not
surrendered
tamely
to
the
vanquished
after
their
defeat
the
gold
and
silver
and
all
that
could
be
stolen
disappeared
the
land
was
in
the
end
ceded
to
the
hospital
but
so
wasted
that
for
a
century
no
revenue
whatever
accrued
from
what
had
been
one
of
the
finest
conventual
estates
in
europe
such
was
the
opening
of
that
social
revolution
which
when
it
reached
its
height
was
called
the
reformation
chapter
vii
the
english
reformation
many
writers
have
pointed
out
the
relation
between
commerce
and
scepticism
in
the
middle
ages
and
among
others
thorold
rogers
has
a
passage
in
his
of
agriculture
and
so
interesting
that
it
should
be
read
entire
the
general
spread
of
lollardy
about
which
all
the
theologians
of
the
age
complain
was
at
once
the
cause
anti
the
effect
of
progressive
opulence
it
can
not
be
by
accident
that
all
the
wealthiest
parts
of
europe
one
district
only
excepted
and
that
for
very
sufficient
reasons
were
suspected
during
the
middle
ages
of
theological
nonconformity
before
the
campaigns
of
simon
de
montfort
in
the
first
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
provence
was
the
garden
and
workshop
of
europe
the
sturdiest
advocates
of
the
reformation
were
the
burghers
of
the
low
countries
in
england
the
strength
of
the
lollard
party
was
from
the
days
of
wiklif
to
the
days
of
cranmer
in
norfolk
the
principal
manufacturing
county
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
presence
of
students
from
this
district
must
have
told
on
the
theological
bias
of
cambridge
university
which
came
out
markedly
at
the
epoch
of
the
reformation
english
lollardy
was
like
its
direct
descendant
puritanism
sour
and
opinionative
but
it
was
also
moral
and
thrifty
they
who
denounced
the
lazy
and
luxurious
life
of
the
monks
the
worldliness
and
greed
of
the
prelates
and
the
gross
and
shallow
artifices
of
the
popular
religion
were
pretty
sure
to
inculcate
parsimony
and
saving
by
voluntarily
and
sturdily
cutting
themselves
off
from
the
circumstance
of
the
old
faith
they
were
certain
like
the
quakers
of
more
than
two
centuries
later
to
become
comparatively
wealthy
they
had
nothing
to
spare
for
monk
or
priest
the
lollards
were
of
the
modern
economic
type
and
discarded
the
miracle
because
the
miracle
was
costly
and
yielded
an
uncertain
return
yet
the
mediæval
cult
was
based
upon
the
miracle
and
many
of
the
payments
due
for
the
supernatural
services
of
the
ecclesiastics
were
obligatory
beside
gifts
as
an
atonement
for
sin
were
a
drain
on
savings
and
the
economist
instinctively
sought
cheaper
methods
of
propitiation
in
an
age
as
unscientific
as
the
sixteenth
century
the
conviction
of
the
immutability
of
natural
laws
was
not
strong
enough
to
admit
of
the
abrogation
of
religious
formulas
the
monied
class
therefore
proceeded
step
by
step
and
its
first
experiment
was
to
suppress
all
fees
to
whether
priests
or
saints
by
becoming
their
own
intercessors
with
the
deity
as
witherspoon
has
observed
fear
of
wrath
from
the
avenger
of
blood
made
men
fly
to
the
city
of
refuge
but
as
the
tradesman
replaced
the
enthusiast
a
dogma
was
evolved
by
which
mental
anguish
which
cost
nothing
was
substituted
for
the
offering
which
was
effective
in
proportion
to
its
money
value
this
dogma
was
justification
by
faith
the
of
protestantism
far
from
requiring
an
outlay
from
the
elect
justification
by
faith
discouraged
it
the
act
consisted
in
a
deep
humiliation
of
mind
confession
of
guilt
and
wretchedness
and
acceptance
of
pardon
and
peace
through
christ
jesus
which
they
have
neither
contributed
to
the
procuring
nor
can
contribute
to
the
continuance
of
by
their
own
yet
the
substitution
of
a
mental
condition
for
a
money
payment
led
to
consequences
more
than
the
suppression
of
certain
clerical
revenues
for
it
involved
the
rejection
of
the
sacred
tradition
which
had
not
only
sustained
relic
worship
but
which
had
made
the
church
the
channel
of
communication
between
christians
and
the
invisible
world
that
ancient
channel
once
closed
protestants
had
to
open
another
and
this
led
to
the
deification
of
the
bible
which
before
the
reformation
had
been
supposed
to
derive
its
authority
from
that
divine
illumination
which
had
enabled
the
priesthood
to
infallibly
declare
the
canon
of
the
sacred
books
calvin
saw
the
weak
spot
in
the
position
of
the
reformers
and
faced
it
boldly
he
maintained
the
scripture
to
be
carrying
with
it
its
own
evidence
and
ought
not
to
be
made
the
subject
of
demonstration
and
arguments
from
reason
and
that
it
should
obtain
the
same
complete
credit
and
authority
with
believers
as
if
they
heard
the
very
words
pronounced
by
god
thus
for
the
innumerable
costly
fetishes
of
the
imaginative
age
were
substituted
certain
writings
which
could
be
consulted
without
a
fee
the
expedient
was
evidently
the
device
of
a
mercantile
community
and
the
saving
to
those
who
accepted
it
enormous
but
it
disintegrated
christendom
and
made
an
organized
priesthood
impossible
when
each
individual
might
pry
into
the
sacred
mysteries
at
his
pleasure
the
authority
of
the
clergy
was
annihilated
men
of
the
priestly
type
among
the
reformers
saw
the
danger
and
tried
to
save
themselves
the
thesis
which
the
early
evangelical
divines
maintained
was
the
unity
of
truth
the
scriptures
were
true
therefore
if
the
whole
body
of
christians
searched
aright
they
could
not
fail
to
draw
truth
from
them
and
this
truth
must
be
the
creed
of
the
universal
church
zwingli
thus
explained
the
doctrine
whoever
hears
the
holy
scriptures
read
aloud
in
church
judges
what
he
hears
nevertheless
what
is
heard
is
not
itself
the
word
through
which
we
believe
for
if
we
believed
through
the
simple
hearing
or
reading
of
the
word
all
would
be
believers
on
the
contrary
we
see
that
many
hear
and
see
and
do
not
believe
hence
it
is
clear
that
we
believe
only
through
the
word
which
the
heavenly
father
speaks
in
our
hearts
by
which
he
enlightens
us
so
that
we
see
and
draws
us
so
that
we
follow
for
god
is
not
a
god
of
strife
and
quarrel
but
of
unity
and
peace
where
there
is
true
faith
there
the
holy
spirit
is
present
but
where
the
holy
spirit
is
there
is
certainly
effort
for
unity
and
peace
therefore
there
is
no
danger
of
confusion
in
the
church
since
if
the
congregation
is
assembled
through
god
he
is
in
the
midst
of
them
and
all
who
have
faith
strive
after
unity
and
the
inference
the
clergy
sought
to
draw
was
that
though
all
could
read
the
bible
only
the
enlightened
could
interpret
it
and
that
they
alone
were
the
enlightened
hence
calvin
s
pretensions
equalled
hildebrand
s
this
is
the
extent
of
the
power
with
which
the
pastors
of
the
church
by
whatever
name
they
may
be
distinguished
ought
to
be
invested
that
by
the
word
of
god
they
may
venture
to
do
all
things
with
confidence
may
constrain
all
the
strength
glory
wisdom
and
pride
of
the
world
to
obey
and
submit
to
his
majesty
supported
by
his
power
may
govern
all
mankind
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
may
build
up
the
house
of
christ
and
subvert
the
house
of
satan
may
feed
the
sheep
and
drive
away
the
wolves
may
instruct
and
exhort
the
docile
may
reprove

and
restrain
the
rebellious
and
obstinate
may
bind
and

may
discharge
their
lightnings
and
thunders
if
necessary
but
all
in
the
word
of
in
certain
regions
poor
and
remote
from
the
centres
of
commerce
these
pretensions
were
respected
in
geneva
scotland
and
new
england
men
like
calvin
knox
and
cotton
maintained
themselves
until
economic
competition
did
its
work
then
they
passed
away
nowhere
has
faith
withstood
the
rise
of
the
mercantile
class
as
a
whole
the
reformation
was
eminently
an
economic
phenomenon
and
is
best
studied
in
england
which
after
the
reformation
grew
to
be
the
centre
of
the
world
s
exchanges
from
the
beginning
of
modern
history
commerce
and
scepticism
have
gone
hand
in
hand
the
eastern
trade
began
to
revive
after
the
reopening
of
the
valley
of
the
danube
about
and
perhaps
in
that
very
year
berenger
the
first
great
modern
heretic
was
born
by
he
had
been
condemned
and
made
to
recant
but
with
the
growth
of
the
fairs
of
champagne
his
heresy
grew
and
in
just
in
the
flush
of
the
communal
development
the
church
found
it
necessary
to
define
the
dogma
of
transubstantiation
and
declare
it
an
article
of
faith
a
generation
later
came
the
burning
of
schismatics
in
by
his
bull
ad
extirpanda
innocent
iv
organized
the
inquisition
and
the
next
year
grossetête
bishop
of
lincoln
died
with
whom
the
organized
opposition
of
the
english
to
the
ancient
costly
ritual
may
be
said
to
have
opened
in
great
britain
the
agitation
for
reform
appears
to
have
been
practical
from
the
outset
there
was
no
impatience
with
dogmas
simply
because
they
were
incomprehensible
the
trinity
and
the
double
procession
were
always
accepted
formulas
of
faith
were
resisted
because
they
involved
a
payment
of
money
and
foremost
among
these
were
masses
and
penances
another
grievance
was
the
papal
patronage
and
as
early
as
the
fourteenth
century
parliament
passed
the
statutes
of
provisors
and
præmunire
to
prevent
the
withdrawal
of
money
from
the
realm
the
rise
of
the
lollards
was
an
organized
movement
to
resist
ecclesiastical
exactions
and
to
confiscate
ecclesiastical
property
and
if
be
taken
as
the
opening
of
wickliffe
s
active
life
the
agitation
for
the
seizure
of
monastic
estates
started
just
a
generation
after
philip
s
attack
on
the
temple
in
france
there
was
at
least
this
difference
in
the
industrial
condition
of
the
two
nations
and
probably
much
more
wickliffe
was
rather
a
politician
than
a
theologian
and
his
preaching
a
diatribe
against
the
extravagance
of
the
church
in
one
of
his
saints
days
sermons
he
explained
the
waste
of
relic
worship
as
shrewdly
as
a
modern
man
of
business
it
would
be
to
the
benefit
of
the
church
and
to
the
honour
of
the
saints
if
the
costly
ornaments
so
foolishly
lavished
upon
their
graves
were
divided
among
the
poor
i
am
well
aware
however
that
the
man
who
would
sharply
and
fully
expose
this
error
would
be
held
for
a
manifest
heretic
by
the
image
worshippers
and
the
greedy
people
who
make
gain
of
such
graves
for
in
the
adoration
of
the
eucharist
and
such
worshipping
of
dead
bodies
and
images
the
church
is
seduced
by
an
adulterous
the
laity
paid
the
priesthood
fees
because
of
their
supernatural
powers
and
the
possession
of
these
powers
was
chiefly
demonstrated
by
the
miracle
of
the
mass
wickliffe
with
a
leader
s
eye
saw
where
the
enemy
was
vulnerable
and
the
last
years
of
his
life
were
passed
in
his
fierce
controversy
with
the
mendicants
upon
transubstantiation
even
at
that
early
day
he
presented
the
issue
with
incomparable
clearness
and
thou
then
that
art
an
earthly
man
by
what
reason
mayst
thou
say
that
thou
makest
thy
maker
the
deduction
from
such
premises
was
inexorable
the
mass
had
to
be
condemned
as
fetish
worship
and
with
it
went
the
adoration
of
relics
indeed
many
nominal
christians
are
worse
than
pagans
for
it
is
not
so
bad
that
a
man
should
honour
as
god
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
first
thing
he
sees
in
the
morning
as
that
regularly
that
accident
should
be
really
his
god
which
he
sees
in
the
mass
in
the
hands
of
the
priest
in
the
consecrated
wickliffe
died
december
and
ten
years
later
the
lollards
had
determined
to
resist
all
payments
for
magic
they
presented
their
platform
to
parliament
in
summed
up
in
their
of
some
of
these
conclusions
are
remarkably
interesting
that
the
exorcisms
and
hallowings
consecrations
and
blessings
over
the
wine
bread
wax
water
oil
salt
incense
the
and
about
the
over
the
vestment
chalice
mitre
cross
and
are
the
very
practices
of
necromancy
rather
than
of
sacred
divinity
we
mightily
affirm
that
spiritual
prayers
made
in
the
church
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
is
a
false
foundation
of
alms
whereupon
all
the
houses
of
alms
in
england
are
falsely
founded
that
pilgrimages
prayers
and
oblations
made
unto
blind
crosses
or
roods
or
to
deaf
images
made
either
of
wood
or
stone
are
very
near
of
kin
unto
when
lord
cobham
the
head
of
the
lollard
party
was
tried
for
heresy
in
archbishop
arundel
put
him
four
test
questions
first
whether
he
believed
after
the
sacramental
words
had
been
spoken
any
material
bread
or
wine
remained
in
the
sacrament
fourth
whether
he
believed
relic
worship
meritorious
his
answers
did
not
give
satisfaction
and
they
roasted
him
in
chains
in
saint
giles
s
fields
in
a
hundred
years
of
high
commercial
activity
followed
cobham
s
death
the
discovery
of
america
and
of
the
sea
passage
to
india
changed
the
channels
of
commerce
throughout
the
world
human
movement
was
accelerated
gunpowder
made
the
attack
overwhelming
centralization
took
a
prodigious
stride
scepticism
kept
pace
with
centralization
and
in
erasmus
wrote
thus
and
yet
remained
in
the
orthodox
communion
moreover
savoureth
it
not
of
the

saulce

to

some

there

that
are
generally

amongst

is
the

in

confidence
yea
almost
more
than
in
her
when
erasmus
wrote
the
reformation
was
at
hand
but
the
attack
on
church
property
had
begun
in
england
full
two
centuries
before
contemporaneously
with
philip
s
onslaught
on
the
temple
all
over
europe
the
fourteenth
century
was
a
period
of
financial
distress
in
france
the
communes
became
bankrupt
and
the
coinage
deteriorated
and
in
england
the
debasement
of
the
currency
began
in
and
kept
pace
with
the
rise
of
lollardy
in
the
silver
penny
weighed
grains
edward
reduced
it
to
grains
edward
iii
to
grains
henry
iv
to
grains
and
henry
during
his
restoration
in
to
grains
as
the
stringency
increased
the
attack
on
the
clergy
gained
in
ferocity
edward
not
only
taxed
the
priesthood
but
seized
the
revenues
of
the
alien
priories
of
these
there
might
have
been
one
hundred
and
fifty
within
the
realm
and
what
he
took
from
them
he
spent
on
his
army
edward
ii
and
edward
iii
followed
the
precedent
and
during
the
last
reign
when
the
penny
dropped
four
grains
these
revenues
were
sequestered
no
less
than
years
under
henry
iv
the
penny
lost
three
grains
and
what
remained
of
the
income
of
these
houses
was
permanently
applied
to
defraying
the
expenses
of
the
court
henry
dissolved
them
and
vested
their
estates
in
the
crown
in
the
reign
of
henry
when
the
penny
was
on
the
point
of
losing
three
grains
of
its
silver
the
tone
of
parliament
was
similar
to
that
of
the
parliaments
of
the
reformation
on
one
occasion
the
king
asked
for
a
subsidy
and
the
speaker
suggested
that
without
burdening
the
laity
he
might
supply
his
occasions
by
seizing
on
the
revenues
of
the
clergy
and
in
lord
cobham
anticipated
the
parliament
of
by
introducing
a
bill
for
the
confiscation
of
conventual
revenues
to
the
amount
of
marks
a
sum
which
he
averred
represented
the
income
of
certain
corporations
whose
names
he
appended
in
a
schedule
year
by
year
as
society
consolidated
the
economic
type
was
propagated
and
as
the
pressure
of
a
contracting
currency
stimulated
these
men
to
action
the
demand
for
cheap
religion
grew
fiercer
london
the
monied
centre
waxed
hotter
and

notoriously
known
to
be
favourers
of
wickliff

side
as
partly
before

is
to
be
seen
and
in

story
of

doth
appear
where
the

of

writing
upon
the
fifteenth

of

reporteth
in
these
words
of
the
londoners
that
they

in

against

that
the

and
both
the
sheriffs
were
sent
for
and
removed
from

the
opening
of
the
sixteenth
century
a
priest
could
hardly
collect
his
dues
without
danger
the
bishop
of
london
indeed
roundly
declared
to
the
government
that

could
not

hun
contested
the
case
and
got
out
a
writ
of
præmunire
against
the
priest
which
so
alarmed
the
clergy
that
the
chancellor
of
the
diocese
accused
him
of
heresy
and
confined
him
in
the
lollard
s
tower
of
saint
paul

in
due
time
the
usual
articles
were
exhibited
against
the

charging
that
he
had
disputed
the
lawfulness
of
tithes
and
had
said
they
were
ordained
only
by
the
covetousness
of

that

of

damnable
works

articles
fitzjames

examined

hanging

verdict
against

then
became
grave

west
of
this

oxford
had
most
burnings
but
by
the
reign
of

manufactures
had
spread
so
far
inland
that
the
industries
of
oxfordshire
were
only
surpassed
by
those
of
middlesex
in
wickliffe
s
time
norwich
stood
next
to
london
and
norwich
was
infested
with
lollards
many
of
whom
were
executed
there
on
the
other
hand
but
two
executions
are
recorded
in
the
six
agricultural
counties
north
of
the
humber
counties
which
were
the
poorest
and
the
farthest
removed
from
the
lines
of

thus
the
eastern
counties
were
the
of
puritanism
there
kett

broke
out
under
edward

there
cromwell
recruited
his
ironsides
and
throughout
this
region
before
the
beginning
of
the
reformation
assaults
on
relics
were
most
frequent
and
violent
one
of
the
most
famous
of
these
relics
was
the
rood
of
dovercourt
dovercourt
is
part
of
harwich
on

essex
coast
dedham
lies
ten
miles
inland
on
the
border
of
suffolk
and
the
description
given
by
foxe
of
the
burning
of
the
image
of
dovercourt
is
an
example
of
what
went
on
throughout
the
southeast
just
before
the
time
of
the
divorce
in
the
same
year
of
our
lord
there
was
an
idol
named
the
rood
of
dovercourt
whereunto
was
much
and
great
resort
of
people
for
at
that
time
there
was
great
rumour
blown
abroad
amongst
the
ignorant
sort
that
the
power
of
the
idol
of
dovercourt
was
so
great
that
no
man
had
power
to
shut
the
where
he
stood
and
therefore
they
let
the
both
night
and
day
continually
stand
open
for
the
more
credit
unto
their
blind
rumour
this
once
being
conceived
in
the
heads
of
the
vulgar
sort
seemed
a
great
marvel
unto
many
men
but
to
many
again
whom
god
had
blessed
with
his
spirit
it
was
greatly
suspected
especially
unto
these
whose
names
here
follow
as
robert
king
of
dedham
robert
debnam
of
eastbergholt
nicholas
marsh
of
dedham
and
robert
gardner
of
dedham
whose
consciences
were
sore
burdened
to
see
the
honour
and
power
of
the
almighty
living
god
so
to
be
blasphemed
by
such
an
idol
wherefore
they
were
moved
by
the
spirit
of
god
to
travel
out
of
dedham
in
a
wondrous
goodly
night
both
hard
frost
and
fair
moonshine
although
the
night
before
and
the
night
after
were
exceeding
foul
and
rainy
it
was
from
the
town
of
dedham
to
the
place
where
the
filthy
rood
stood
ten
miles
notwithstanding
they
were
so
willing
in
that
their
enterprise
that
they
went
these
ten
miles
without
pain
and
found
the
church
door
open
according
to
the
blind
talk
of
the
ignorant
people
for
there
durst
no
unfaithful
body
shut
it
this
happened
well
for
their
purpose
for
they
found
the
idol
which
had
as
much
power
to
keep
the
door
shut
as
to
keep
it
open
and
for
proof
thereof
they
took
the
idol
from
his
shrine
and
carried
him
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
place
where
he
stood
without
any
resistance
of
the
said
idol
whereupon
they
struck
fire
with
a
and
suddenly
set
him
on
fire
who
burned
out
so
brim
that
he
lighted
them
homeward
one
good
mile
of
the
ten
this
done
there
went
a
great
talk
abroad
that
they
should
have
great
riches
in
that
place
but
it
was
very
untrue
for
it
was
not
their
thought
or
enterprise
as
they
themselves
afterwards
confessed
for
there
was
nothing
taken
away
but
his
coat
his
shoes
and
the
tapers
the
tapers
did
help
to
burn
him
the
shoes
they
had
again
and
the
coat
one
sir
thomas
rose
did
burn
but
they
had
neither
penny
halfpenny
gold
groat
nor
jewel
notwithstanding
three
of
them
were
afterwards
indicted
of
felony
and
hanged
in
chains
within
half
a
year
or
thereabout
the
same
year
and
the
year
before
there
were
many
images
cast
down
and
destroyed
in
many
places
as
the
image
of
the
crucifix
in
the
highway
by
coggeshall
the
image
of
saint
petronal
in
the
church
of
great
horksleigh
the
image
of
saint
christopher
by
sudbury
and
another
image
of
saint
petronal
in
a
chapel
of
england
s
economic
supremacy
is
recent
and
has
resulted
from
the
change
in
the
seat
of
exchanges
which
followed
the
discovery
of
america
and
the
to
india
long
before
columbus
however
the
introduction
of
the

had
altered

finally
the
discoveries

at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
threw
italy
completely
out

succeeded
for
the

time
in
establishing
themselves
advantageously
in

thenceforward
england
began
to
play
a
part
in
the
industrial
competition
of
europe
but
even
then
her
progress
was
painfully
slow

while

great
britain
hung
on
the
outskirts
of
the
commercial
system
of
the
world
and
even
at
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
henry
viii
she
could
not
compare
either
in
wealth
refinement
or
organization
with
such
a
kingdom
as
france
the
crown
had
not
been
the
prize
of
the
strongest
in
a
struggle
among
equals
but
had
fallen
to
a
soldier
of
a
superior
race
under
whom
no
great
nobility
ever
grew
up
no
baron
in
england
corresponded
with
such
princes
as
the
dukes
of
normandy
and
burgundy
the
counts
of
champagne
and
toulouse
fortifications
were
on
a
puny
scale
no
strongholds
like
pierrefonds
or
vitré
coucy
or
carcassonne
existed
and
the
tower
of
london
itself
was
insignificant
beside
the
château
gaillard
which
planted
on
the
seine
the
population
was
scanty
and
increased
little
when
henry
viii
came
to
the
throne
in
london
may
have
had
forty
or
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
york
eleven
thousand
bristol
nine
or
ten
thousand
and
norwich
six
thousand
paris
at
that
time
probably
contained
between
three
and
four
hundred
thousand
and
milan
and
ghent
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
each
but
although
england
was
not
a
monied
centre
during
the
middle
ages
and
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
she
felt
with
acuteness
the
financial
pressure
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
she
had
little
gold
and
silver
and
gold
and
silver
rose
in
relative
value
she
had
few
manufactures
and
manufactures
were
comparatively
prosperous
her
wealth
lay
in
her
agricultural
interests
and
farm
products
were
for
the
most
part
severely
pinched
commenting
on
the
prices
between
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
rogers
has
observed
again
upon
several
articles
of
the
first
importance
there
is
a
marked
decline
in
the
price
from
the
average
of
to
that
of
this
would
have
been
more
conspicuous
if
i
had
in
my
earlier
volumes
compared
all
prices
from
to
with
those
of
but
even
over
the
whole
range
every
kind
of
grain
except
wheat
and
peas
is
dearer
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
than
it
is
in
the
first
hundred
and
forty
years
of
the
present
period
and
had
i
taken
the
average
price
of
wheat
during
the
last
fifty
years
of
the
fourteenth
century
it
would
have
been
dearer
than
the
average
of
heightened
as
this
is
by
the
dearness
of
the
last
thirteen
the
tables
published
by
rogers
make
it
possible
to
form
some
idea
of
the
strain
to
which
the
population
of
great
britain
was
exposed
during
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
which
intervened
between
the
crisis
at
the
close
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
the
discovery
of
the
mines
of
potosi
in
which
flooded
the
world
with
silver
throughout
this
long
interval
an
expanding
commerce
unceasingly
enlarged
the
demand
for
currency
while
no
adequate
additions
were
made
to
the
stock
of
the
precious
metals
the
consequence
was
that
their
relative
value
rose
while
the
value
of
commodities
declined
and
this
process
had
a
tendency
to
debase
the
coinage
the
latter
part
of
the
middle
ages
was
a
time
of
rapid
centralization
when
the
cost
of
administration
grew
from
year
to
year
but
in
proportion
as
the
necessities
of
the
government
increased
the
power
of
the
people
to
pay
taxes
diminished
because
the
products
which
they
sold
brought
less
of
the
standard
coin
to
meet
the
deficit
the
same
weight
of
metal
had
to
be
cut
into
more
pieces
and
thus
by
a
continued
inflation
of
the
currency
general
bankruptcy
was
averted
the
various
stages
of
pressure
are
pretty
clearly
marked
by
the
records
of
the
mint
apparently
the
stringency
which
began
in
france
about
the
end
of
the
reign
of
saint
louis
or
somewhat
later
did
not
affect
england
immediately
for
prices
do
not
seem
to
have
reached
their
maximum
until
after
and
edward
only
reduced
the
penny
in
from
grains
of
silver
to
grains
thenceforward
the
decline
though
spasmodic
on
the
whole
tended
to
increase
in
severity
from
generation
to
generation
the
long
french
wars
and
the
black
death
produced
a
profound
effect
upon
the
domestic
economy
of
the
kingdom
under
edward
iii
and
the
black
death
especially
seems
to
have
had
the
unusual
result
of
raising
prices
at
a
time
of
commercial
collapse
this
rise
probably
was
due
to
the
dearth
of
labour
for
half
the
population
of
europe
is
said
to
have
perished
and
at
all
events
the
crops
often
could
not
be
reaped
through
lack
of
hands
more
than
a
generation
elapsed
before
normal
conditions
returned
immediately
before
the
french
war
the
penny
lost
two
grains
and
between
and
during
the
black
death
it
lost
two
grains
and
a
quarter
more
a
depreciation
of
four
grains
and
a
half
in
fifty
years
then
for
half
a
century
an
equilibrium
was
maintained
under
henry
iv
there
was
a
sharp
decline
of
three
grains
equal
to
an
inflation
of
seventeen
per
cent
and
by
under
henry
the
penny
fell
to
twelve
grains
then
a
period
of
stability
followed
which
lasted
until
just
before
the
reformation
when
a
crisis
unparalleled
in
severity
began
a
crisis
which
probably
was
the
proximate
cause
of
the
confiscation
of
the
conventual
estates
in
the
penny
suddenly
lost
a
grain
and
a
half
or
about
twelve
and
a
half
per
cent
and
then
when
further
reductions
of
weight
would
have
made
the
piece
too
flimsy
the
government
resorted
to
adulteration
in
a
penny
was
coined
with
one
part
in
five
of
alloy
in
the
alloy
had
risen
to
and
in
of
the
coin
was
base
metal
a
depreciation
of
more
than
seventy
per
cent
in
twenty
years
meanwhile
though
prices
had
fluctuated
the
trend
had
been
downward
and
downward
so
strongly
that
it
had
not
been
fully
counteracted
by
the
reductions
of
bullion
in
the
money
rogers
thought
perhaps
the
best
gauge
of
prices
and
in
commenting
on
the
years
which
preceded
the
reformation
he
remarked
from
to
the
average
of
is
very
little
higher
than
it
was
from
to
illustrating
anew
that
significant
decline
in
prices
which
characterizes
the
economical
history
of
england
during
the
eighty
years
although
wheat
rose
more
than
other
grains
and
is
therefore
an
unfavourable
standard
of
comparison
wheat
yields
substantially
the
same
result
during
the
last
forty
years
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
average
price
of
the
quarter
was
and
for
the
last
decade
for
the
first
forty
years
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
average
was
the
penny
of
however
contained
only
about
per
cent
of
the
bullion
of
the
penny
of
the
most
remarkable
fact
in
connection
with
the
issue
of
base
money
by
henry
viii
is
the
singular
identity
of
the
average
price
of
grain
especially
wheat
during
the
first
years
of
my
present
period
with
the
last
of
my
first
two
after
a
full
examination
of
his
tables
rogers
concluded
that
the
great
rise
which
made
the
prosperity
of
elizabeth
s
reign
did
not
begin
until
some
year
between
and
this
corresponds
precisely
with
the
discovery
of
potosi
in
and
that
the
advance
was
due
to
the
new
silver
and
not
to
the
debasement
of
the
coinage
seems
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
no
fall
took
place
when
the
currency
was
restored
by
elizabeth
but
on
the
contrary
the
upward
movement
continued
until
well
into
the
next
century
some
idea
may
be
formed
from
these
figures
of
the
contraction
which
prevailed
during
the
years
of
the
reformation
in
toward
the
close
of
henry
s
reign
the
penny
held
five
grains
of
pure
silver
as
against
about
grains
in
and
yet
its
purchasing
power
had
not
greatly
varied
bullion
must
therefore
have
had
about
four
times
the
relative
value
in
that
it
had
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
earlier
and
if
the
extremely
debased
issues
of
and
later
be
taken
as
the
measure
its
value
was
much
higher
had
potosi
been
discovered
a
generation
earlier
the
whole
course
of
english
development
might
have
been
modified
for
it
is
not
impossible
that
without
the
aid
of
falling
prices
the
rising
capitalistic
class
might
have
lacked
the
power
to
confiscate
the
monastic
estates
as
it
was
the
pressure
continued
until
the
catastrophe
occurred
relic
worship
was
swept
away
the
property
of
the
nation
was
redistributed
and
an
impulsion
was
given
to
large
farming
which
led
to
the
rapid
eviction
of
the
yeomanry
as
the
yeomen
were
driven
from
their
land
they
roamed
over
the
world
colonizing
and
conquering
from
the
mississippi
to
the
ganges
building
up
in
the
course
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
a
centralization
greater
than
that
of
rome
and
more
absolute
than
that
of
constantinople
changes
so
vast
in
the
forms
of
competition
necessarily
changed
the
complexion
of
society
men
who
had
flourished
in
an
age
of
decentralization
and
of
imagination
passed
away
and
were
replaced
by
a
new
aristocracy
the
soldier
and
the
priest
were
overpowered
and
from
the
reformation
downward
the
monied
type
possessed
the
world
thomas
cromwell
earl
of
essex
was
the
ideal
of
this
type
and
he
was
accordingly
the
englishman
who
rose
highest
during
the
convulsion
of
the
reformation
he
was
a
perfect
commercial
adventurer
and
chapuys
the
ambassador
of
charles
at
london
thus
described
his
origin
to
his
master
cromwell
is
the
son
of
a
poor
farrier
who
lived
in
a
little
village
a
league
and
a
half
from
here
and
is
buried
in
the
parish
graveyard
his
uncle
father
of
the
cousin
whom
he
has
already
made
rich
was
cook
of
the
late
archbishop
of
canterbury
cromwell
was
when
young
and
after
an
imprisonment
was
forced
to
leave
the
country
he
went
to
flanders
rome
and
elsewhere
in
italy
when
he
returned
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
shearman
and
served
in
his
house
he
then
became
a
the
trouble
which
drove
him
abroad
seems
to
have
been
with
his
father
and
he
probably
started
on
his
travels
about

led
a
dissolute
and
vagabond
life
served
as
a
mercenary
in
italy
was
wild
and
youthful
as
he
himself
was
wont
ofttimes
to
declare
unto
cranmer
archbishop
of
canterbury
showing
what
a
ruffian
he
was
in
his
young
days
also
what
a
great
doer
he
was
with
geffery
chambers
in
publishing
and
setting
forth
the
pardons
of
boston
everywhere
in
churches
as
he
these
pardons
were
indulgences
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
the
pope
for
the
town
of
boston
which
he
peddled
about
the
country
as
he
went
he
served
as
a
clerk
in
the
counting
house
of
the
merchant
adventurers
at
antwerp
and
also
appears
to
have
filled
some
such
position
with
a
venetian
merchant
on
his
return
to
england
in
he
married
and
set
up
a
he
also
became
an
attorney
and
a
usurer
dwelling
by
fenchurch
in
london
in
having
been
elected
to
parliament
cromwell
was
a
most
prosperous
man
at
this
time
he
entered
wolsey
s
service
and
made
himself
of
use
in
suppressing
convents
to
supply
endowments
for
the
cardinal
s
colleges
at
oxford
and
ipswich
when
wolsey
fell
he
ingratiated
himself
with
henry
and
thenceforward
rose
rapidly
he
became
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
master
of
the
rolls
secretary
of
state
vicar
general
a
knight
of
the
garter
and
earl
of
essex
at
once
the
head
of
church
and
state
probably
no
english
subject
has
ever
been
so
powerful
both
he
and
cranmer
succeeded
through
flexibility
and
adroitness
he
suggested
to
henry
to
accomplish
his
ends
by
robbing

for

he
made

he
scrupled
not

is

account

to

not

attended
to
the
racking
of

witnesses

went
in
state
to
see

for
denying
the
royal

which
he
was
labouring
to
establish
his
behaviour
to
lambert

he
sent
to
the
fire
for
confessing
his
own
principles
astonished
even
those
who
knew
him
well
how
he
became
a
protestant
is
uncertain
foxe
thought
by
reading
erasmus
s
translation
of
the
new
testament
more
probably
he
was
sceptical
because
he
was
of
the
economic
type
at
all
events
he
hated
rome
and
foxe
said
that
in
he
was
the
chief
friend
of
the
in
that
same
year
lambert
was
tried
for
heresy
regarding
transubstantiation
and
it
was
then
cromwell
sentenced
him
to
be
burned
alive
characteristically
he
is
said
to
have
invited
him
to
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
the
execution
and
to
have
then
begged
his
pardon
for
what
he
had
done
pole
described
a
conversation
he
had
with
essex
about
the
duty
of
ministers
to
kings
pole
thought
their
first
obligation
was
to
consider
their
masters
honour
and
insisted
on
the
divergence
between
honour
and
expediency
such
notions
seemed
fantastic
to
cromwell
who
told
pole
that
a
prudent
politician
would
study
a
prince
s
inclinations
and
act
accordingly
he
then
offered
pole
a
manuscript
of
machiavelli
s
such
a
temperament
differed
not
so
much
in
degree
as
in
kind
from
that
of
godfrey
de
bouillon
or
saint
louis
bayard
or
the
black
prince
it
was
subtler
more
acquisitive
more
tenacious
of
life
and
men
and
women
of
the
breed
of
cromwell
rose
rapidly
to
be
the
owners
of
england
during
the
sixteenth
century
social
standards
changed
even
in
ages
a
lofty
courtesy
had
always
been
deemed
befitting
the
great
saint
anselm
and
héloïse
saladin
and
have
remained
ideals
for
centuries
because
they
represented
a
phase
of
civilization
and
froissart
has
described
how
the
black
prince
entertained
his
prisoners
after
poitiers
the
prince
himself
served
the
king
s
table
as
well
as
the
others
with
every
mark
of
humility
and
would
not
sit
down
at
it
in
spite
of
all
his
entreaties
for
him
so
to
do
saying
that
he
was
not
worthy
of
such
an
honour
nor
did
it
appertain
to
him
to
seat
himself
at
the
table
of
so
great
a
king
or
of
so
valiant
a
man
as
he
had
shown
himself
by
his
actions
that
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
progress
had
eliminated
chivalry
manners
were
coarse
and

loose

respect
of
the
society
they
saw
chapuys
permitted
himself
to
sneer
at

who
afterward
became
queen
because
he
seems
to
have
thought

of

venal

the
scandals
of
the
boleyn
family
are
too
well
known
to
need
notice
and
it
would
be
futile
to
accumulate
examples
of
the
absence
of
female
virtue
when
the
fact
is
notorious
the
rising
nobility
resembled
cromwell
more
or
less
feebly
the
mercenary
quality
was
the
salient
characteristic
of
the
favoured
class
thomas
boleyn
earl
of
wiltshire
made
his
fortune
through
his
own
shrewdness
and
the
beauty
of
his
daughters
mary
the
younger
was
an
early
mistress
of
henry
anne
the
elder
and
the
astuter
was
his
wife
boleyn
s
title
and
his
fortune
came
through
this
connection
boleyn
was
a
specimen
of
a
class
in
him
the
instinct
of
was
highly
developed
when
his
daughter
anne
and
his
son
lord
rochford
were
tried
at
the
tower
for
incest
the
evidence
was
so
flimsy
that
ten
to
one
was
bet
in
the
on
acquittal
at
this
supreme
moment
the
attitude
of
the
father
was
thus
described
by
chapuys
who
had
good
sources
of
information
on
the
the
said
concubine
and
her
brother
were
condemned
of
treason
by
all
the
principal
lords
of
england
and
the
duke
of
norfolk
her
uncle
pronounced
sentence
i
am
told
the
earl
of
wiltshire
was
quite
as
ready
to
assist
at
the
judgment
as
he
had
done
at
the
condemnation
of
the
other
the
grandfather
of
thomas
boleyn
had
been
an
alderman
of
london
and
a
rich
tradesman
his
son
had
been
knighted
and
had
retired
from
business
and
wiltshire
himself
though
a
younger
son
and
with
but
fifty
pounds
a
year
when
married
raised
himself
by
his
wits
and
the
use
of
his
children
to
be
a
wealthy
earl
the
history
of
the
cecil
family
is
not
dissimilar
david
the
first
of
the
name
who
emerged
from
obscurity
gained
a
certain
favour
under
henry
viii
his
son
richard
a
most
capable
manager
obtained
a
fair
share
of
the
monastic
plunder
was
groom
of
the
robes
constable
of
warwick
castle
and
died
rich
his
son
was
the
great
lord
burleigh
in
regard
to
whom
perhaps
it
may
be
best
to
quote
an
impartial
authority
macaulay
described
him
as
possessed
of
a
cool
temper
a
sound
judgment
great
powers
of
application
and
a
constant
eye
to
the
main
chance
he
never
deserted
his
friends
till
it
was
very
inconvenient
to
stand
by
them
was
an
excellent
protestant
when
it
was
not
very
advantageous
to
be
a
papist
recommended
a
tolerant
policy
to
his
mistress
as
strongly
as
he
could
recommend
it
without
hazarding
her
favour
never
put
to
the
rack
any
person
from
whom
it
did
not
seem
probable
that
useful
information
might
be
derived
and
was
so
moderate
in
his
desires
that
he
left
only
three
hundred
distinct
landed
estates
though
he
might
as
his
honest
servant
assures
us
have
left
much
more
if
he
would
have
taken
money
out
of
the
exchequer
for
his
own
use
as
many
treasurers
have
the
howards
though
of
an
earlier
time
were
of
the
same
temperament
the
founder
was
a
lawyer
who
sat
on
the
bench
of
the
common
pleas
under
edward
and
who
therefore
did
not
earn
his
knighthood
on
a
stricken
field
as
the
black
prince
won
his
spurs
at
crécy
after
his
death
his
descendants
made
little
stir
for
a
century
but
they
married
advantageously
accumulated
money
and
in
the
fifteenth
century
one
robert
howard
married
a
daughter
of
thomas
mowbray
duke
of
norfolk
this
he
hardly
would
have
done
had
he
not
been
a
man
of
substance
since
he
seems
not
to
have
been
a
man
of
war
the
alliance
made
the
fortune
of
the
family
it
also
appears
to
have
added
some
martial
instinct
to
the
stock
for
richard
iii
gave
john
howard
the
title
of
the
mowbrays
and
this
john
was
afterwards
killed
at
bosworth
his
son
commanded
at
flodden
and
his
grandson
was
the
great
spoiler
of
the
convents
under
henry
who
also
suppressed
the
northern
rebellion
thomas
howard
the
minister
of
henry
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
characters
of
his
generation
he
was
naturally
a
strong
conservative
chapuys
never
doubted
that
the
change
in
matters
of
religion
was
not
to
his
mind
in
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
tell
the
french
ambassador
that
he
would
not
consent
to
a
change
and
this
speech
having
been
repeated
to
the
king
occasioned
his
momentary
disgrace
at
one
time
lord
darcy
the
head
of
the
reactionary
party
counted
on
his
support
against
cromwell
though
he
warned
chapuys
not
to
trust
him
implicitly
because
of
his
yet
under
a
certain
appearance
of
vacillation
he
hid
a
profound
and
subtle
appreciation
of
the
society
which
environed
him
this
inconstancy
made
his
high
fortune
he
had
a
sure
instinct
which
taught
him
at
the
critical
moment
where
his
interests
lay
and
he
never
was
deceived
henry
distrusted
him
but
could
not
do
without
him
and
paid
high
for
his
support
howard
on
his
side
was
keenly
distressed
when
he
found
he
had
gone
too
far
and
when
the
northern
insurrection
broke
out
and
he
was
offered
the
command
of
the
royal
forces
the
bishop
of
carlisle
with
whom
he
dined
said
he
had
never
seen
the
duke
so
happy
as
he
was
once
in
the
field
against
his
friends
there
were
no
lengths
to
which
thomas
howard
would
not
go
he
never
wearied
of
boasting
of
his
lies
and
of
his
cruelty
he
wrote
to
assure
henry
he
would
spare
no
pains
to
entrap
them
and
would
esteem
no
promise
he
made
to
the
rebels
for
surely
i
shall
observe
no
part
thereof
for
any
respect
of
that
other
might
call
mine
honor
as
cromwell
behaved
toward
lambert
so
he
behaved
toward
the
carthusians
though
they
were
men
in
whose
religion
he
probably
believed
as
sincerely
as
he
believed
anything
and
in
whose
cause
he
had
professed
himself
ready
to
take
up
arms
when
they
were
sent
to
the
stake
he
attended
the
execution
as
a
spectacle
and
watched
them
expire
in
torments
without
a
pang
men
gifted
like
howard
were
successful
in
the
reformation
and
norfolk
made
a
colossal
fortune
out
of
his
polities
the
price
of
his
service
was
thirteen
convents
and
his
son
surrey
had
two
of
what
he
made
in
other
ways
no
record
remains
such
was
the
new
aristocracy
but
the
bulk
of
the
old
baronage
was
differently
bred
and
those
who
were
of
the
antiquated
type
were
doomed
to
pass
away
the
publication
of
the
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
ancient
feudal
gentry
both
titled
and
untitled
as
a
body
opposed
the
reform
many
of
the
most
considerable
of
these
were
compromised
in
the
pilgrimage
of
grace
in
among
whom
was
thomas
lord
darcy
if
a
mediæval
baron
still
lived
in
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
that
man
was
darcy
since
the
conqueror
granted
the
norman
de
areci
thirty
lordships
in
lincolnshire
his
ancestors
had
been
soldiers
and
at
his
home
in
the
north
his
retainers
formed
an
army
as
of
old
born
in
at
he
bound
himself
by
indenture
to
serve
henry
vii
beyond
the
sea
at
the
head
of
a
thousand
men
and
more
than
forty
years
afterward
he
promised
chapuys
that
he
would
march
against
london
with
a
force
eight
thousand
strong
if
the
emperor
would
attack
henry
viii
all
his
life
long
he
had
fought
upon
the
borders
he
had
been
captain
of
berwick
warden
of
the
east
and
middle
marches
and
in
he
had
volunteered
to
lead
a
british
contingent
against
the
moors
he
was
a
knight
of
the
garter
a
member
of
the
privy
council
and
when
the
insurrection
broke
out
he
commanded
at
pontefract
castle
the
strongest
position
in
yorkshire
a
survival
of
the
past
he
retained
the
ideas
of
crécy
and
poitiers
and
these
brought
him
to
the
block
while
negotiations
were
pending
norfolk
seems
to
have
wanted
to
save
him
though
possibly
he
may
have
been
actuated
by
a
more
sinister
purpose
at
all
events
he
certainly
wrote
suggesting
to
darcy
to
make
his
peace
by
ensnaring
aske
the
rebel
leader
and
giving
him
up
to
the
government
to
norfolk
this
seemed
a
perfectly
legitimate
transaction
by
such
methods
he
rose
to
eminence
to
darcy
it
seemed
dishonour
and
he
died
for
it
instead
of
doing
as
he
was
bid
he
reproached
norfolk
for
deeming
him
capable
of
treachery
where
your
lordship
advises
me
to

averred
that
he
surrendered
pontefract
to
the
rebels
because
the
government
neglected
to
relieve
him
and
although
doubtless
he
always
sympathized
with
the
rising
he
promptly
wrote
to
london
when
the
outbreak
began
to
warn
henry
not
only
of
the
weakness
of
his
fortress
but
of
the
power
of
the
enemy
when
the
royal
herald
visited
the
castle
to
treat
with
the
insurgents
he
found
darcy
sir
robert
constable
aske
and
others
who
told
him
they
were
on
a
pilgrimage
to
london
to
have
all
the
vile
blood
put
from
the
privy
council
and
noble
blood
set
up
again
and
to
make
restitution
for
the
wrongs
done
the
church
this
aske
was
he
whom
darcy
refused
to
betray
but
instead
he
offered
to
do
all
he
could
as
a
true
knight
and
subject
to
pacify
the
country
and
he
did
help
to
persuade
the
rebels
to
disperse
on
henry
s
promise
of
a
redress
of
grievances
in
the
moment
of
peril
both
darcy
and
aske
were
pardoned
and
cajoled
but
the
rising
monied
type
were
not
the
men
to
let
the
soldiers
escape
them
once
they
held
them
disarmed
even
while
henry
was
plotting
the
destruction
of

to
whom
he
had
pledged

word
norfolk
wrote
from

i
have
by

brought
him

to
desire

to
yeve
him
licence
to

have
promised
to
write
a
letter
which
i
pray
you

perished
on

darcy
and
his

recognized
that
a
new
world
had
risen
about
them
in
which
they
had
no
place
during
his
imprisonment
in
london
before
his
execution
he
was
examined
by
cromwell
and
thus
almost
with
his
dying
words
addressed
the
man
who
was
the
incarnation
of
the

that
killed
him

it
is
thou
that
art
the
very
original
and
chief
causer
of

causer

daily
earnestly

bring

procure

the
suppression
of
the
convents
at
the
apex
of
the
new
society
stood
henry
who
like
philip
the
fair
had
many
of
the
qualities
which
make
a
great
religious
reformer
in
an
economic
age
in
reaching
an
estimate
of
his
nature
however
the
opinions
of
englishmen
are
of
no
great
value
since
they
are
usually
distorted
by
prejudice
the
best
observers
were
the
foreign
ministers
at
his
court
whose
business
was
to
collect
information
for
their

charles
de
marillac
was
born
in
he
belonged
to
an
old
family
and
had
an
unblemished
reputation
he
had
no
leaning
against
protestants
for
he
was
disgraced
by
the
guise
party
he
was
thirty
when
in
london
as
ambassador
of
francis
i
after
having
been
a
year
in
england
he
wrote
this
prince
seems
to
me
subject
among
other
vices
to
three
which
certainly
in
a
king
may
be
called
pests
of
which
the
first
is
that
he
is
so
avaricious
and
covetous
that
all
the
riches
of
the
world
would
not
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
and
content
his
ambition
from
this
proceeds
the
second
evil
and
pest
which
is
distrust
and
fear
wherefore
he
ceaselessly
embrews
his
hands
in
blood
feeling
in
his
mind
doubt
of
those
about
him
wishing
to
live
without
suspicion
which
every
day
augments
and
in
part
from
these
two
evils
proceeds
the
last
pest
which
is
levity
and
inconstancy
and
partly
also
from
the
temper
of
the
nation
by
which
they
have
perverted
the
rights
of
religion
of
marriage
of
honesty
and
honour
as
if
they
were
wax
the
which
alloy
can
change
itself
into
whatever
forms
they
cruelty
was
one
of
henry
s
most
salient
traits
and
was
perhaps
the
faculty
by
which
he
succeeded
in
imposing
himself
most
strongly
upon
his
contemporaries
he
not
only
murdered
his
wives
his
ministers
and
his
friends
but
he
pursued
those
who
opposed
him
with
a
vindictiveness
which
appalled
them
he
was
ingenious
in
devising
torments
friar
forest
whose
crime
was
the
denial
of
the
royal
supremacy
he
caused
to
be
slowly
roasted
over
a
rood
which
he
had
fetched
from
wales
on
purpose
they
hanged
him
in
smithfield
in
chains
upon
a
gallows
quick
by
the
middle
and
and
fire
was
made
under
him
and
so
was
he
consumed
and
burned
to
henry
relished
the
idea
of
the
show
so
much
that
chapuys
thought
him
disappointed
at
not
being
able
to
attend
with
his
whole
court
his
way
of
dealing
with
the
carthusians
was
equally
characteristic
the
carthusians
were
in
the
church
what
darcy
was
in
the
state
men
of
the
old
imaginative
type
of
austere
life
and
ascetic
habits
in
whom
still
glowed
the
fiery
enthusiasm
of
hildebrand
they
could
not
accept
henry
as
god
s
viceregent
upon
earth
the
three
priors
houghton
webster
and
lawrence
were
ripped
up
in
each
other
s
presence
their
arms
torn
off
their
hearts
cut
out
and
rubbed
upon
their
mouths
and
three
more
were
chained
upright
to
posts
where
they
stood
for
fourteen
days
without
the
possibility
of
stirring
for
any
purpose
whatever
held
fast
by
iron
collars
on
their
necks
arms
and
then
they
were
hanged
and
disembowelled
in
ten
were
still
resolute
they
were
chained
in
newgate
like
the
others
where
according
to
stowe
nine
died
with
stink
and
miserably
the
tenth
who
survived
was
hanged
had
henry
been
hampered
like
darcy
with
scruples
about
honour
truth
or
conscience
he
too
might
have
been
undone
his
power
lay
in
his
capacity
for
doing
what
was
needful
for
success
he
enticed
aske
to
london
and
when
he
held
him
slew
him
he
pardoned
darcy
and
then
sent
him
to
tower
hill
lacking
force
to
crush
the
rebels
norfolk
in
the
royal
name
pacified
the
people
with
pardon
and
promises
of
redress
they
dispersed
thinking
themselves
safe
henry
ignored
his
pledges
risings
followed
but
when
the
country
had
been
tranquillized
and
his
army
was
again
in
peaceful
possession
he
thus
instructed
the
duke
our
pleasure
is
that
you
shal
in
any
wise
cause
suche
dredfull
execution
to
be
doon
upon
a
good
nombre
of
thinhabitauntes
of
every
towne
village
and
hamlet
that
have
offended
in
this
rebellion
aswell
by
the
hanging
of
them
uppe
in
trees
as
by
the
quartering
of
them
and
the
setting
of
their
heddes
and
quarters
in
every

and

and
in

requyre
you
to

so
slendre
punishment
shuld
be
doon
upon
them
as
the
dredde
thereof
shuld
not
be
a
warning
to
norfolk
was
after
henry
s
pattern
the
rebels
were
his
friends
men
with
whom
he
had
pledged
himself
to
act
shortly
before
but
he
had
chosen
his
side
he
had
made
his
bargain
and
he
earned
his
pay
he
was
never
weary
of
boasting
of
his
cruelty
toward
the
defenceless
yeomanry
they
shall
be
put
to
death
in
every
town
where
they
dwelt
as
many
as
chains
of
iron
can
be
made
for
in
this
town
and
in
the
country
shall
be
hanged
in
them
the
rest
in
ropes
iron
is
marvellous
he
tried
his
prisoners
by
court
martial
for
he
dared
not
trust
the
juries
many
of
the
farmers
declared
they
had
been
forced
to
join
in
the
insurrection
through
threats
of
violence
and
these
might
have
been
acquitted
they
say
i
came
out
for
fear
of
my
life
or
for
fear
of
burning
my
houses
and
destroying
of
my
wife
and
but
where
henry
and
norfolk
were
concerned
there
were
no
acquittals
in
the
same
way
henry
destroyed
his
ministers
when
he
had
done
with
them
though
cromwell
was
sagacious
he
was
less
crafty
than
henry
just
before
his
fall
the
king
made
him
earl
of
essex
and
he
lived
in
such
complete
ignorance
of
his
fate
that
his
disgrace
fell
like
a
marillac
has
described
how
one
day
in
the
council
chamber
cromwell
was
arrested
without
warning
and
moved
with
indignation
he
plucked
his
hat
from
his
head
and
threw
it
wrathfully
upon
the
ground
saying
to
norfolk
and
to
the
rest
of
the
council
assembled
that
this
was
his
reward
for
his
services
to
the
king
adding
that
since
he
was
so
treated
he
renounced
all
hope
and
all
he
asked
of
the
king
his
master
was
not
to
let
him
languish
the
duke
of
norfolk
having
reproached
him
with
all
the
villanies
done
by
him
tore
from
him
the
order
of
saint
george
which
he
wore
about
his
neck
and
the
admiral
to
show
himself
as
much
his
enemy
in
adversity
as
he
had
been
believed
to
be
his
friend
in
prosperity
undid
his
garter
from
one
point
of
view
henry
s
vanity
was
a
weakness
for
it
laid
him
open
to
attack
and
the
diplomatic
correspondence
is
filled
with
sneers
like
this
of
castillon
s
il
n
oublye
jamais
sa
grandeur
et
se
taist
de
celle
des
probably
nothing
in
english
civilization
has
ever
equalled
the
adulation
he
exacted
from
his
courtiers
and
especially
from
his
bishops
yet
even
this
vanity
was
a
source
of
strength
for
it
made
him
insensible
to
ridicule
which
would
have
unnerved
saint
louis
on
very
scanty
evidence
he
caused
his
wife
to
be
arraigned
for
incest
and
during
the
trial
appeared
in
public
so
gaily
dressed
and
after
her
conviction
danced
before
the
court
in
such
open
delight
that
chapuys
himself
was
surprised
there
are
still
two
english
gentlemen
detained
on
her
account
and
it
is
suspected
that
there
will
be
many
more
because
the
king
has
said
he
believed
that
more
than
had
to
do
with
her
you
never
saw
prince
or
man
who
made
greater
show
of
his
horns
or
bore
them
more
his
manners
like
those
of
cromwell
and
norfolk
lacked
the
courtesy
which
distinguished
men
even
of
his
own
generation
like
sir
thomas
more
he
was
gluttonous
and
and
toward
the
end
of
his
life
so
bloated
as
to
be
helpless
his
habits
were
well
understood
at
court
and
suitors
tried
to
approach
him
in
the
afternoon
when
he
was
tipsy
marillac
thought
his
gormandizing
would
kill
him
there
has
been
little
doubt
about
the
king
not
so
much
for
the
fever
as
for
the
trouble
with
the
leg
which
he
has
had
which
trouble
seizes
him
very
often
because
he
is
very
gross
and
marvellously
excessive
in
eating
and
drinking
so
that
you
often
find
him
of
a
different
purpose
and
opinion
in
the
morning
from
what
you
do
after
on
may
castillon
wrote
furthermore
the
king
has
had
one
of
the
fistulas
on
his
legs
closed
and
since
ten
or
twelve
days
the
humors
which
have
no
vent
have
taken
to
stifling
him
so
much
so
that
he
has
been
some
of
the
time
speechless
the
face
all
black
and
in
great
the
most
marked
characteristic
of
the
feudal
aristocracy
had
been
personal
courage
but
as
centralization
advanced
and
a
paid
police
removed
the
necessity
of
bravery
ceased
to
be
essential
to
success
henry
apparently
was
not
courageous
certainly
was
not
courageous
in
regard
to
disease
when
most
infatuated
with
anne
boleyn
she
fell
ill
of
the
sweating
sickness
he
fled
at
once
and
wrote
from
a
distance
to
beg
her
to
fear
nothing
as
few
or
no
women
have
died
of
marillac
declared
roundly
that
in
such
matters
the
king
was
the
most
timid
person
one
could
on
the
other
hand
he
was
habitually
so
overbearing
as
to
be
brutal
to
the
weak
lambert
was
a
poor
sectary
of
whom
he
determined
to
make
an
example
he
therefore
prepared
a
solemn
function
at
which
he
presided
assisted
by
the
bishops
and
the
other
dignitaries
of
the
realm
the
accused
when
brought
before
this
tribunal
apparently
showed
some
confusion
and
foxe
has
left
a
striking
description
of
how
henry
tried
to
heighten
this
terror
henry
was
dressed
all
in
white
probably
emblematic
of
his
purity
as
the
head
of
the
church
and
his
look
his
cruel
countenance
and
his
brows
bent
into
severity
did
not
a
little
augment
this
terror
plainly
declaring
a
mind
full
of
indignation
far
unworthy
such
a
prince
especially
in
such
a
matter
and
against
so
humble
and
obedient
a
gifted
with
such
qualities
henry
could
not
have
failed
to
be
a
great
religious
reformer
at
the
opening
of
a
great
economic
age
more
than
five
hundred
years
before
when
society
hung
on
the
brink
of
dissolution
the
church
sustained
centralization
by
electing
hugh
capet
king
of
france
a
century
later
the
armed
pilgrimages
to
palestine
had
accelerated
the
social
movement
and
consolidation
again
began
generation
by
generation
the
rapidity
of
movement
had
increased
communication
had
been
between
the
east
and
west
the
mariner
s
compass
and
gunpowder
had
been
introduced
into
europe
the
attack
had
mastered
the
defence
and
as
the
forms
of
competition
slowly
changed
capital
accumulated
until
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
wealth
reached
the
point
where
it
could
lay
the
foundation
of
the
paid
police
the
crowning
triumph
of
the
monied
class
the
reformation
was
the
victory
of
this
class
over
the
archaic
type
of
man
and
with
the
reformation
the
old
imaginative
civilization
passed
away
but
with
all
its
power
the
monied
intellect
has
certain
weaknesses
and
neither
in
ancient
rome
nor
modern
england
have
capitalists
been
soldiers
the
tudor
aristocracy
was
not
a
martial
caste
lacking
physical
force
this
new
nobility
feared
the
ancient
farming
population
whom
they
slowly
exterminated
and
they
feared
them
with
reason
for
from
among
the
yeomanry
cromwell
drew
his
ironsides
therefore
one
of
the
chief
preoccupations
of
the
tudor
nobility
was
to
devise
means
to
hold
this
dangerous
element
in
check
and
as
it
could
not
organize
an
army
it
utilized
the
church
the
had
other
purposes
for
the
priesthood
than
simply
to
rob
it
they
had
also
to
enslave
it
and
henry
s
title
to
greatness
lies
in
his
having
attained
both
ends
he
not
only
plundered
as
no
other
man
has
plundered
but
he
succeeded
in
assuming
the
functions
of
god
s
high
priest
and
becoming
christ
s
vicar
upon
earth
upon
this
point
there
can
be
no
difference
of
opinion
not
only
are
the
formularies
of
the
church
of
england
clear
but
anglicans
themselves
admit
it
macaulay
was
of
henry
s
communion
macaulay
is
an
historian
whose
opinion
on
such
a
point
commands
respect
and
macaulay
has
summed
up
the
position
of
henry
viii
as
the
head
of
the
capitalistic
hierarchy
in
these
words
what
henry
and
his
favourite
counsellors
meant
at
one
time
by
the
supremacy
was
certainly
nothing
less
than
the
whole
power
of
the
keys
the
king
was
to
be
the
pope
of
his
kingdom
the
vicar
of
god
the
expositor
of
catholic
verity
the
channel
of
sacramental
graces
he
arrogated
to
himself
the
right
of
deciding
dogmatically
what
was
orthodox
doctrine
and
what
was
heresy
of
drawing
up
and
imposing
confessions
of
faith
and
of
giving
religious
instruction
to
his
people
he
proclaimed
that
all
jurisdiction
spiritual
as
well
as
temporal
was
derived
from
him
alone
and
that
it
was
in
his
power
to
confer
episcopal
authority
and
to
take
it
away
according
to
this
system
as
expounded
by
cranmer
the
king
was
the
spiritual
as
well
as
the
temporal
chief
of
the
nation
in
both
capacities
his
highness
must
have
lieutenants
as
he
appointed
civil
officers
to
keep
his
seal
to
collect
his
revenues
and
to
dispense
justice
in
his
name
so
he
appointed
divines
of
various
ranks
to
preach
the
gospel
and
to
administer
the
sacraments
it
was
unnecessary
that
there
should
be
any
imposition
of
hands
the
king
such
was
the
opinion
of
cranmer
given
in
the
plainest
words
might
in
virtue
of
authority
derived
from
god
make
a
priest
and
the
priest
so
made
needed
no
ordination
under
the
tudors
commerce
and
industry
were
yet
in
their
infancy
great
britain
still
remained
substantially
agricultural
and
capital
primarily
sought
investment
in
land
the
enclosure
of
the
commons
and
the
confiscations
of
the
monastic
estates
together
formed
a
gigantic
real
estate
speculation
with
which
faith
had
little
to
do
and
which
was
possible
only
because
force
began
to
express
itself
through
another
type
of
intellect
than
that
which
had
been
able
to
defend
its
property
during
an
imaginative
age
the
commercial
community
always
demanded
cheap
religion
under
henry
they
inclined
toward
zwingli
under
elizabeth
toward
calvin
under
charles
they
were
presbyterian
the
gentry
on
the
contrary
were
by
nature
conservative
and
favoured
orthodoxy
as
far
as
their
interest
in
church
plunder
permitted
them
henry
and
norfolk
stood
at
the
head
of
this
class
norfolk
s
conversion
to
protestantism
has
been
explained
by
chapuys
and
henry
remained
a
bigot
to
his
death
shortly
before
he
died
when
about
to
communicate
as
he
always
did
under
one
kind
he
rose
up
from
his
chair
and
fell
on
his
knees
to
adore
the
body
of
our
lord
the
zwinglians
who
were
present
said
that
his
majesty
by
reason
of
his
bodily
weakness
might
make
his
communion
sitting
in
his
chair
the
king
s
answer
was
if
i
could
throw
myself
down
not
only
on
the
ground
but
under
the
ground
i
should
not
then
think
that
i
gave
honour
enough
to
the
most
holy
as
to
norfolk
chapuys
has
left
his
opinion
in
very
plain
words
he
norfolk
has
a
good
deal
changed
his
tune
for
it
was
he
alone
in
the
court
who
showed
himself
the
best
of
catholics
and
who
favoured
most
the
authority
of
the
pope
but
he
must
act
in
this
way
not
to
lose
his
remaining
influence
which
apparently
does
not
extend
much
further
than
cromwell
to
attain
their
end
the
rising
class
at
whose
head
these
two
men
stood
had
to
doubly
despoil
the
church
in
whose
dogmas
they
believed
they
confiscated
her
lands
to
enrich
themselves
and
they
suppressed
her
revenues
to
buy
the
support
of
the
traders
finally
their
lack
of
physical
force
suggested
to
them
the
expedient
of
seizing
on
the
ecclesiastical
organization
and
filling
it
with
their
servants
who
should
teach
the
people
the
religious
duty
of
submission
to
an
authority
which
distrusted
an
appeal
to
arms
as
henry
and
norfolk
represented
the
landed
magnates
so
cromwell
represented
the
mercantile
community
and
when
the
alliance
between
these
two
monied
interests
had
been
perfected
by
the
appointment
of
cromwell
as
secretary
of
state
some
time
previous
to
april
events
moved
with
precision
and
rapidity
they
crowned
anne
boleyn
on
june
in
july
the
breach
between
the
king
and
pope
became
irreparable
in
november
parliament
declared
henry
supreme
head
of
the
church
and
in
the
following
winter
the
whole
administration
both
civil
and
ecclesiastical
was
concentrated
in
cromwell
s
hands
he
acted
with
astonishing
energy
in
the
autumn
of
he
set
on
foot
a
visitation
preparatory
to
the
dissolution
of
the
convents
and
parliament
passed
the
bill
for
suppression
the
next
february
cromwell
also
as
vicar
general
presided
over
the
convocation
of
canterbury
which
made
the
first
reformation
of
faith
this
convocation
met
in
june
only
shortly
before
the
pilgrimage
of
grace
and
under
the
fear
of
violence
henry
and
the
conservatives
were
reduced
to
silence
the
evangelical
influence
for
the
moment
held
control
and
the
ten
articles
the
foundation
of
the
articles
together
with
the
institution
of
a
christian
man
which
were
produced
were
a
great
departure
from
orthodoxy
in
the
fourth
article
the
dogma
of
the
supper
was
made
broad
enough
to
include
lutherans
and
in
the
sixth
image
worship
was
condemned
on
the
other
hand
justification
by
faith
began
to
assume
the
importance
it
must
always
hold
in
all
really
protestant
confessions
in
one
of
his
homilies
cranmer
at
a
later
time
showed
the
comparative
futility
of
good
works
a
man
must
needs
be
nourished
by
good
works
but
first
he
must
have
faith
he
that
doeth
good
deeds
yet
without
faith
he
hath
no
life
i
can
shew
a
man
that
by
faith
without
works
lived
and
came
to
heaven
but
without
faith
never
man
had
never
had
the
jews
in
their
most
blindness
so
many
pilgrimages
unto
images
as
hath
been
used
in
our
time
keeping
in
divers
places
as
it
were
marts
or
markets
of
merits
being
full
of
their
holy
relics
images
shrines
and
works
of
overflowing
abundance
ready
to
be
sold
holy
cowls
holy
girdles
holy
pardons
heads
holy
shoes
holy
rules
and
all
full
of
holiness
which
were
so
esteemed
and
abused
to
the
great
prejudice
of
god
s
glory
and
commandments
that
they
were
made
most
high
and
most
holy
things
whereby
to
attain
to
the
everlasting
life
or
remission
of
the
movement
under
henry
viii
culminated
in
and
when
the
country
rebelled
and
the
were
in
need
of
help
from
the
towns
as
long
as
the
latter
felt
uncertain
of
their
grip
on
church
lands
the
radical
mercantile
interest
was
permitted
to
mould
doctrine
but
when
norfolk
had
triumphed
in
the
north
and
aske
and
darcy
had
been
executed
a
reaction
set
in
in
november
lambert
was
burned
for
denying
transubstantiation
and
in
the
chapter
in
the
statute
book
which
followed
that
providing
for
the
suppression
of
the
mitred
abbeys
auricular
confession
communion
in
one
kind
private
masses
and
in
a
word
strict
orthodoxy
saving
in
the
single
tenet
of
the
royal
supremacy
to
have
conceded
that
would
have
endangered
property
twelve
months
later
the
landed
magnates
felt
strong
enough
to
discard
the
tradesmen
the
alliance
which
had
carried
through
the
reformation
was
dissolved
and
cromwell
was
beheaded
never
did
pope
enforce
the
worship
of
the
miracle
more
savagely
than
did
henry
by
the
act
of
the
six
articles
the
denial
of
the
miracle
of
the
mass
was
punished
by
burning
and
forfeiture
of
goods
without
the
privilege
of
abjuration
purity
of
faith
could
not
have
been
the
ideal
of
reformers
until
quite
recently
protestants
have
accepted
the
tradition
that
the
convents
of
england
were
suppressed
by
the
revolt
of
a
people
outraged
by
the
disclosure
of
abominations
perpetrated
under
the
shelter
of
monasticism
within
a
few
years
the
publication
of
the
british
archives
has
thrown
a
new
and
sombre
light
upon
the
reformation
they
seem
to
prove
beyond
a
doubt
that
as
philip
dealt
with
the
templars
so
did
henry
deal
with
all
the
religious
orders
of
his
realm
in
henry
s
position
was
desperate
he
confronted
not
only
the
pope
and
the
emperor
but
all
that
remained
of
the
old
feudal
society
and
all
that
survived
of
the
decaying
imaginative
age
nothing
could
resist
this
combination
save
the
rising
power
of
centralized
capital
and
henry
therefore
had
to
become
the
mouthpiece
of
the
men
who
gave
expression
to
this
force
he
needed
money
and
money
in
abundance
and
cromwell
rose
to
a
practical
dictatorship
because
he
was
fittest
to
provide
it
on
all
that
relates
to
essex
foxe
is
an
undoubted
authority
and
foxe
did
not
hesitate
to
attribute
to
cromwell
henry
s
policy
at
this
crisis
for
so
it
pleased
almighty
god
by
means
of
the
said
lord
cromwell
to
induce
the
king
to
suppress
first
the
chantries
then
the
friars
houses
and
small
monasteries
till
at
length
all
the
abbeys
in
england
both
great
and
less
were
utterly
overthrown
and
plucked
up
by
the
roots
of
how
great
laud
and
praise
this
man
was
worthy
and
what
courage
and
stoutness
was
in
him
it
may
hereby
evidently
appear
unto
all
men
that
he
alone
through
the
singular
dexterity
of
his
wit
and
counsel
brought
to
pass
that
which
even
unto
this
day
no
prince
or
king
throughout
all
europe
dare
or
can
bring
to
pass
for
whereas
brittania
alone
of
all
other
nations
is
and
hath
been
of
her
own
proper
nature
most
superstitious
this
cromwell
being
born
of
a
common
or
base
stock
through
a
divine
method
or
policy
of
wit
and
reason
received
suffered
deluded
brake
off
and
repressed
all
the
policies
trains
malice
and
hatred
of
friars
monks
religious
men
and
priests
of
which
sort
there
was
a
great
rabble
in
cromwell
s
strength
lay
in
his
superiority
to
those
scruples
of
truth
and
honour
which
hamper
feebler
men
he
did
what
circumstances
demanded
his
object
like
philip
s
was
to
blacken
his
victims
that
he
might
destroy
them
and
to
gather
the
evidence
he
chose
instruments
adapted
to
the
work
to
have
used
others
would
have
demonstrated
himself
unfit
gairdner
has
remarked
in
his
preface
to
the
tenth
volume
of
the
we
have
no
reason
indeed
to
think
highly
of
the
character
of
cromwell
s
this
opinion
of
gairdner
is
supported
by
all
the
evidence
extant
thomas
legh
one
of
the
commissioners
not
only
always
took
bribes
but
having
been
appointed
master
of
sherburn
hospital
administered
it
to
the
utter
disinheritance
decay
and
destruction
of
the
ancient
and
godly
foundation
of
the
same
henry
probably
thought
him
dishonest
since
he
had
his
accounts
investigated
even
legh
s
colleague
ap
rice
though
venal
himself
and
in
great
fear
of
being
murdered
for
his
treachery
denounced
him
in
set
terms
to
cromwell
and
surely
he
asketh
no
less
for
every
election
than
as
of
duty
which
in
my
opinion
is
too
much
and
above
any
duty
that
was
ever
taken
heretofore
also
in
his
visitations
he
refuseth
many
times
his
reward
though
it
be
competent
for
that
they
offer
him
so
little
and
maketh
them
to
send
after
him
such
rewards
as
may
please
him
for
surely
religious
men
were
never
afraid
so
much
of
allen
as
they
be
of
him
he
useth
such
rough
fashion
with
the
next
day
however
ap
rice
in
alarm
lest
his
frankness
might
lead
to
his
assassination
wrote
to
beg
his
master
to
be
cautious
forasmuch
as
the
said
mr
doctor
is
of
such
acquaintance
and
familiarity
with
many
rufflers
and
serving
men
i
having
commonly
no
great
assistance
with
me
when
i
go
abroad
might
take
perchance
irrevocable
harm
of
him
or
his
ere
i
were
aware
please
keep
secret
what
i
have
ap
rice
himself
had
been
in
difficulty
and
legh
had
exposed
him
for
he
admitted
being
so
abashed
at
the
accusation
he
could
make
no
defence
he
had
also
certainly
done
something
which
put
him
in
the
power
of
cromwell
for
he
wrote
i
know
from
my
own
experience
how
deadly
it
is
for
any
man
to
incur
your
displeasure
which
i
would
not
wish
for
my
greatest
the
testimony
of
such
witnesses
would
be
of
doubtful
value
even
had
they
expressed
themselves
freely
but
the
government
only
tolerated
one
form
of
report
a
good
example
of
the
discipline
enforced
is
to
be
found
in
layton
s
correspondence
he
incautiously
praised
the
abbot
of
glastonbury
and
was
reprimanded
by
cromwell
for
he
wrote
to
excuse
himself
whereas
i
understand
by
pollard
you
much
marvel
why
i
would
so
greatly
praise
the
abbot
of
glaston
so
that
my
excessive
and
indiscrete
praise
must
needs
now
redound
to
my
great
folly
and
untruth
and
can
not
but
much
diminish
my
credit
towards
his
majesty
and
even
so
to
your
lordship
and
although
they
be
all
false
feigned
flattering
hypocritical
knaves
as
undoubtedly
there
is
none
other
of
that
sort
i
must
therefore
now
at
this
my
necessity
most
humbly
beseech
your
lordship
to
pardon
me
for
that
my
folly
then
committed
and
of
your
goodness
to
mitigate
the
king
s
highness
majesty
in
the
the
charges
made
by
the
visitors
are
of
a
kind
notoriously
difficult
to
prove
even
with
ample
time
and
with
trained
investigators
cromwell
s
examination
was
carried
on
by
men
of
small
worth
and
in
hot
haste
no
opportunity
was
given
for
more
than
a
cursory
inspection
of
the
premises
and
the
inmates
this
day
we
leave
bath
for
kensam
where
we
shall
make
an
end
by
tuesday
and
then
go
on
toward
maiden
bradley
within
two
miles
of
which
is
a
charterhouse
called
wittame
and
bruton
abbey
seven
miles
and
glastonbury
seven
miles
if
you
tarry
with
the
king
eight
days
we
shall
dispatch
all
the
houses
above
the
visitation
began
in
august
and
ended
in
february
during
these
six
months
four
or
five
men
often
travelling
together
undertook
to
examine
one
hundred
and
houses
scattered
all
over
england
to
judge
by
the
proportion
in
yorkshire
says
gairdner
the
visitors
examined
only
about
four
out
of
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
the
evidence
upon
which
the
reports
were
based
was
generally
of
the
flimsiest
kind
either
the
scandal
of
some
discontented
monk
or
nun
or
the
tattle
of
servants
there
was
a
striking
instance
of
this
at
a
nunnery
in
chicksand
where
layton
accused
two
nuns
of
incontinence
although
the
two
prioresses
would
not
confess
this
neither
the
parties
nor
any
of
the
nuns
but
one
old
when
nothing
could
be
elicited
the
accused
were
deemed
in
a
conspiracy
at
newark
the
house
seemed
well
ordered
and
nothing
questionable
appeared
on
the
surface
therefore
layton
charged
the
monks
with
being
confederyde
but
he
added
that
he
would
object
various
horrible
crimes
against
them
which
i
have
learnt
from
others
what
i
shall
find
i
can
not
where
silence
was
taken
as
confession
the
nuns
especially
fared
ill
very
generally
they
were
too
frightened
or
too
disgusted
to
answer
even
if
such
evidence
were
uncontradicted
no
great
weight
could
attach
to
it
but
it
happens
that
there
is
much
on
the
other
side
not
to
speak
of
the
episcopal
visitations
which
were
carried
on
as
part
of
the
discipline
of
the
church
henry
s
own
government
subsequently
appointed
boards
of
commissioners
composed
of
country
gentlemen
and
these
boards
which
made
examinations
at
leisure
in
five
counties
formed
conclusions
generally
favourable
to
the
ecclesiastics
two
examples
will
suffice
to
show
the
discrepancy
between
the
views
of
the
men
whom
cromwell
did
and
did
not
control
at
geradon
in
leicestershire
cromwell
s
board
reported
a
convent
of
white
cistercians
which
contained
five
monks
addicted
to
sodomy
with
ten
boys
the
second
board
described
the
same
corporation
as
of
good
conversation
and
god
s
service
well
at
grace
dieu
two
nuns
were
charged
with
incontinence
the
country
gentlemen
found
there
only
fifteen
white
nuns
of
saint
austin
of
good
and
virtuous
conversation
and
no
one
familiar
with
the
development
of
police
during
the
later
middle
ages
could
have
much
doubt
that
on
the
whole
the
discipline
of
the
convents
would
correspond
pretty
accurately
with
the
prevailing
tone
of
society
and
that
although
asceticism
and
enthusiasm
might
have
declined
since
the
twelfth
century
subordination
to
authority
would
have
increased
with
the
advance
of
centralization
rebellious
monks
like
those
who
tried
to
murder
abélard
would
certainly
have
been
rarer
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
than
at
the
opening
of
the
crusades
the
crime
of
the
english
monks
like
the
crime
of
the
templars
was
defenceless
wealth
and
like
the
templars
they
fared
hardly
in
proportion
to
their
devotion
and
their
courage
the
flexible
and
the
corrupt
who
betrayed
their
trust
received
pensions
or
promotion
the
carthusians
against
whose
stern
enthusiasm
torments
were
powerless
perished
as
their
predecessors
had
perished
in
the
field
of
saint
antoine
the
attack
of
cromwell
s
hirelings
resembled
the
onslaught
of
an
invading
army
the
convents
fared
like
conquered
towns
the
shrines
were
stripped
and
the
booty
heaped
on
carts
as
at
the
sack
of
constantinople
churches
were
desecrated
windows
broken
the
roofs
stripped
of
lead
the
bells
melted
the
walls
sold
for
quarries
europe
overflowed
with
vestments
and
altar
ornaments
while
the
libraries
were
destroyed
toward
the
end
of
legh
reached
durham
and
the
purification
of
the
sanctuary
of
saint
cuthbert
may
be
taken
as
an
example
of
the
universal
spoliation
after
the
spoil
of
his
ornaments
and
jewels
coming
nearer
to
his
sacred
body
thinking
to
have
found
nothing
but
dust
and
bones
and
finding
the
chest
that
he
did
lie
in
very
strongly
bound
with
iron
then
the
goldsmith
did
take
a
great
of
a
smith
and
did
break
the
said
chest
open
and
when
they
had
opened
the
chest
they
found
him
lying
whole
uncorrupt
with
his
face
bare
and
his
beard
as
it
had
been
a
fortnight
s
growth
and
all
his
vestments
upon
him
as
he
was
accustomed
to
say
mass
withall
and
his
meet
wand
of
gold
lying
beside
him
then
when
the
goldsmith
did
perceive
that
he
had
broken
one
of
his
legs
when
he
did
break
open
the
chest
he
was
very
sorry
for
it
and
did
cry
alas
i
have
broken
one
of
his
then
henley
one
of
the
commissioners
hearing
him
say
so
did
call
upon
him
and
did
bid
him
cast
down
his
by
the
statute
of
only
those
convents
were
suppressed
which
were
worth
less
than
a
year
or
which
within
twelve
months
after
the
passage
of
the
act
should
be
granted
to
the
king
by
the
abbot
this
legislation
spared
the
mitred
abbeys
and
as
long
as
any
conventual
property
remained
undivided
the
kept
cromwell
in
office
not
feeling
perhaps
quite
sure
of
their
capacity
to
succeed
alone
in
it
had
proved
impossible
to
force
the
three
great
abbots
of
glastonbury
reading
and
colchester
into
a
surrender
to
the
crown
and
accordingly
cromwell
devised
an
act
to
vest
in
henry
such
conventual
lands
as
should
be
forfeited
through
attainder
then
he
indicted
the
abbots
for
treason
and
thus
sought
to
bring
the
estates
they
represented
constructively
within
the
statute
the
fate
of
abbot
whiting
whom
layton
incautiously
praised
will
do
for
all
he
was
eighty
when
he
died
and
his
martyrdom
is
unusually
interesting
as
it
laid
the
fortune
of
the
great
house
of
bedford
one
of
the
most
splendid
of
modern
dukedoms
the
commissioners
came
unexpectedly
and
found
the
old
monk
at
a
grange
at
sharpham
about
a
mile
from
glastonbury
on
september
they
apprehended
him
searched
his
apartment
and
finding
nothing
likely
to
be
of
service
sent
him
up
to
london
for
cromwell
to
deal
with
though
he
was
very
weak
and
cromwell
lodged
him
in
the
tower
and
examined
him
apparently
in
a
purely
perfunctory
fashion
for
the
government
had
decided
on
its
policy
the
secretary
of
state
simply
jotted
down
a
memorandum
to
see
that
the
evidence
be
well
sorted
and
the
indictments
well
drawn
and
left
the
details
of
the
murder
to
john
russell
a
man
thoroughly
to
be
trusted
cromwell
s
only
anxiety
was
about
the
indictments
and
he
had
the
king
s
learned
counsel
with
him
all
day
discussing
the
matter
finally
they
decided
between
them
that
it
would
be
better
to
proceed
at
glaston
and
whiting
was
sent
to
somersetshire
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
progenitor
of
a
long
line
of
opulent
whig
landlords
in
superintending
the
trial
russell
showed
an
energy
and
judgment
which
won
its
reward
on
the
of
november
when
the
invalid
reached
wells
he
wrote
that
he
had
provided
for
him
as
worshipful
a
jury
as
was
ever
charged
here
these
many
years
and
there
was
never
seen
in
these
parts
so
great
appearance
as
were
here
at
this
present
time
and
never
better
willing
to
serve
the
russell
wasted
no
time
he
arranged
for
the
trial
one
day
and
the
execution
the
next
the
abbot
of
glastonbury
was
arraigned
and
the
next
day
put
to
execution
with
two
other
of
his
monks
for
the
robbing
of
glastonbury
he
had
the
old
man
bound
on
a
hurdle
and
dragged
to
the
top
of
tor
hill
but
he
would
confess
no
more
gold
nor
silver
nor
any
other
thing
more
than
he
did
before
your
lordship
in
the
tower
and
thereupon
took
his
death
very
patiently
and
his
head
and
body
bestowed
in
like
manner
as
i
certified
your
lordship
in
my
last
one
quarter
standeth
at
wells
another
at
bath
and
at
ilchester
and
bridgewater
the
rest
and
his
head
upon
the
abbey
gate
at
on
the
of
the
following
april
henry
created
cromwell
earl
of
essex
preparatory
to
slaughtering
him
within
two
months
the
new
earl
was
arrested
by
his
bitterest
enemy
the
duke
of
norfolk
the
chief
of
the
landed
interest
on
the
of
july
he
lost
his
head
on
tower

and
his
colossal
fortune

the
men

chapter
ix
the
eviction
of
the
yeomen
like
primitive
rome
england
during
the
middle
ages
had
an
unusually
homogeneous
population
of
farmers
who
made
a
remarkable
infantry
not
that
the
cavalry
was
defective
on
the
contrary
from
top
to
bottom
of
society
every
man
was
a
soldier
and
the
aristocracy
had
excellent
fighting
qualities
many
of
the
kings
like
edward
and
henry
ranked
among
the
ablest
commanders
of
their
day
the
black
prince
has
always
been
a
hero
of
chivalry
and
earls
and
barons
could
be
named
by
the
score
who
were
famous
in
the
hundred
years
war
yet
although
the
english
knights
were
a
martial
body
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
on
the
whole
they
surpassed
the
french
the
english
infantry
won
crécy
and
poitiers
and
this
infantry
which
was
long
the
terror
of
europe
was
recruited
from
among
the
small
farmers
who
flourished
in
great
britain
until
they
were
exterminated
by
the
advance
of
civilization
as
long
as
the
individual
could
at
all
withstand
the
attack
of
the
centralized
mass
of
society
england
remained
a
for
breeding
this
species
of
man
a
mediæval
king
had
no
means
of
collecting
a
regular
revenue
by
taxation
he
was
only
the
chief
of
the
and
his
estates
were
supposed
to
suffice
for
his
expenditure
the
revenue
the
land
yielded
consisted
of
men
not
money
and
to
obtain
men
the
sovereign
granted
his
domains
to
his
nearest
friends
who
in
their
turn
cut
their
manors
into
as
many
farms
as
possible
and
each
farmer
paid
his
rent
with
his
body
a
baron
s
strength
lay
in
the
band
of
spears
which
followed
his
banner
and
therefore
he
subdivided
his
acres
as
much
as
possible
having
no
great
need
of
money
himself
a
farmer
he
cultivated
enough
of
his
fief
to
supply
his
wants
to
provide
his
table
and
to
furnish
his
castle
but
beyond
this
all
he
kept
to
himself
was
loss
under
such
a
system
money
contracts
played
a
small
part
and
economic
competition
was
unknown
the
tenants
were
whose
estates
passed
from
father
to
son
by
a
fixed
tenure
no
one
could
underbid
them
with
their
landlord
and
no
capitalist
could
ruin
them
by
depressing
wages
for
the
serfs
formed
the
basis
of
society
and
these
serfs
were
likewise
in
theory
the
villains
may
have
held
at
will
but
in
fact
they
were
probably
the
descendants
or
at
least
the
representatives
of
the
of
the
empire
and
a
base
tenure
could
be
proved
by
the
roll
of
the
manorial
court
thus
even
the
weakest
were
protected
by
custom
and
there
was
no
competition
in
the
labour
market
the
manor
was
the
social
unit
and
as
the
country
was
sparsely
settled
waste
spaces
divided
the
manors
from
each
other
and
these
wastes
came
to
be
considered
as
commons
appurtenant
to
the
domain
in
which
the
tenants
of
the
manor
had
vested
rights
the
extent
of
these
rights
varied
from
generation
to
generation
but
substantially
they
amounted
to
a
privilege
of
pasture
fuel
or
the
like
aids
which
though
unimportant
to
large
property
owners
were
vital
when
the
margin
of
income
was
narrow
during
the
old
imaginative
age
before
centralization
gathered
headway
little
inducement
existed
to
pilfer
these
domains
since
there
was
room
in
plenty
and
the
population
increased
slowly
if
at
all
the
moment
the
form
of
competition
changed
these
conditions
were
reversed
precisely
when
a
money
rent
became
a
more
potent
force
than
armed
men
may
be
hard
to
determine
but
certainly
that
time
had
come
when
henry
viii
mounted
the
throne
for
then
capitalistic
farming
was
on
the
increase
and
speculation
in
real
estate
already
caused
sharp
distress
at
that
time
the
establishment
of
a
police
had
destroyed
the
value
of
the
retainer
and
competitive
rents
had
generally
supplanted
military
tenures
instead
of
tending
to
subdivide
as
in
an
age
of
decentralization
land
consolidated
in
the
hands
of
the
economically
strong
and
capitalists
systematically
enlarged
their
estates
by
enclosing
the
commons
and
depriving
the
yeomen
of
their
immemorial
rights
the
landlords
were
a
type
quite
distinct
from
the
ancient
feudal
gentry
as
a
class
they
were
gifted
with
the
economic
and
not
with
the
martial
instinct
and
they
throve
on
competition
their
strength
lay
in
their
power
of
absorbing
the
property
of
their
weaker
neighbours
under
the
protection
of
an
overpowering
police
everything
tended
to
accelerate
consolidation
especially
the
rise
in
the
value
of
money
while
even
with
the
debasement
of
the
coin
the
price
of
cereals
did
not
advance
the
growth
of
manufactures
had
caused
wool
to
double
in
value
we
need
not
therefore
be
surprised
at
finding
that
the
temptation
to
was
almost
irresistible
and
that
statute
after
statute
failed
to
arrest
the
the
conversion
of
arable
land
into
pasture
led
of
course
to
wholesale
eviction
and
by
the
suffering
had
become
so
acute
that
details
were
given
in
acts
of
parliament
places
where
two
hundred
persons
had
lived
by
growing
corn
and
grain
were
left
desolate
the
houses
had
decayed
and
the
churches
fallen
into
ruin
the
language
of
these
statutes
proves
that
the
descriptions
of
contemporaries
were
not
exaggerated
for
i
myselfe
know
many
townes
and
villages
sore
decayed
for
yt
where
as
in

is
more
to
be

the

and
accounts
for
their
slight
rise
in
value
during
the
second
quarter
of
the
sixteenth
century
nevertheless
this
rise
gave
the
farmer
no
relief
as
under
competition
rents
advanced
faster
than
prices
and
in
the
generation
which
reformed
the
church
the
misery
of
yeomen
had
become
extreme
in
latimer
preached
a
sermon
which
contains
a
passage
often
quoted
but
always
interesting
furthermore
if
the
king
s
honour
as
some
men
say
standeth
in
the
great
multitude
of
people
then
these
graziers
inclosers
and
are
hinderers
of
the
king
s
honour
for
where
as
have
been
a
great
many
householders
and
inhabitants
there
is
now
but
a
shepherd
and
his
dog
my
father
was
yeoman
and
had
no
lands
of
his
own
only
he
had
a
farm
of
three
or
four
pound
by
year
at
the
uttermost
and
hereupon
he
tilled
so
much
as
kept
half
a
dozen
men
he
had
walk
for
a
hundred
sheep
and
my
mother
milked
thirty
kine
he
was
able
and
did
find
the
king
a
harness
with
himself
and
his
horse
while
he
came
to
the
place
that
he
should
receive
the
king
s
wages
i
can
remember
that
i
buckled
his
harness
when
he
went
unto
blackheath
field
he
kept
me
to
school
or
else
i
had
not
been
able
to
have
preached
before
the
king
s
majesty
now
he
married
my
sisters
with
five
pound
or
twenty
nobles
apiece
so
that
he
brought
them
up
in
godliness
and
fear
of
god
he
kept
hospitality
for
his
poor
neighbours
and
some
alms
he
gave
to
the
poor
and
all
this
he
did
of
the
said
farm
where
he
that
now
hath
it
payeth
sixteen
pound
by
year
or
more
and
is
not
able
to
do
anything
for
his
prince
for
himself
nor
for
his
children
or
give
a
cup
of
drink
to
the
the
small
proprietor
suffered
doubly
he
had
to
meet
the
competition
of
large
estates
and
to
endure
the
curtailment
of
his
resources
through
the
enclosure
of
the
commons
the
effect
was
to
pauperize
the
yeomanry
and
lesser
gentry
and
before
the
reformation
the
homeless
poor
had
so
multiplied
that
in
parliament
passed
the
first
of
a
series
of
vagrant
acts
at
the
outset
the
remedy
applied
was
comparatively
mild
for
mendicants
were
only
to
be
whipped
until
they
were
bloody
returned
to
their
domicile
and
there
whipped
until
they
put
themselves
to
labour
as
no
labour
was
supplied
the
legislation
failed
and
in
the
emptying
of
the
convents
brought
matters
to
a
climax
meanwhile
parliament
tried
the
experiment
of
killing
off
the
unemployed
by
the
second
act
vagrants
were
first
mutilated
and
then
hanged
as
felons
in
when
edward
vi
was
crowned
the
great
crisis
had
reached
its
height
the
silver
of
potosi
had
not
yet
brought
relief
the
currency
was
in
chaos
labour
was
disorganized
and
the
nation
seethed
with
the
discontent
which
broke
out
two
years
later
in
rebellion
the
held
absolute
power
and
before
they
yielded
to
the
burden
of
feeding
the
starving
they
seriously
addressed
themselves
to
the
task
of
extermination
the
preamble
of
the
third
act
stated
that
in
spite
of
the
great
travel
and
godly
statutes
of
parliament
pauperism
had
not
diminished
therefore
any
vagrant
brought
before
two
justices
was
to
be
adjudged
the
slave
of
his
captor
for
two
years
he
might
be
compelled
to
work
by
beating
chaining
or
otherwise
be
fed
on
bread
and
water
or
refuse
meat
and
confined
by
a
ring
of
iron
about
his
neck
arms
or
legs
for
his
first
attempt
at
escape
his
slavery
became
perpetual
for
his
second
he
was
hanged
even
as
late
as
in
the
midst
of
the
great
expansion
which
brought
prosperity
to
all
europe
and
when
the
monks
and
nuns
cast
adrift
by
the
suppression
of
the
convents
must
have
mostly
died
beggars
so
swarmed
that
at
the
funeral
of
the
earl
of
shrewsbury
there
were
by
the
report
of
such
as
served
the
dole
unto
them
the
number
of
and
they
thought
that
there
were
almost
as
many
more
that
could
not
be
served
through
their
unruliness
yea
the
press
was
so
great
that
divers
were
slain
and
many
hurt
and
further
it
is
reported
of
credible
persons
that
well
estimated
the
number
of
all
the
said
beggars
that
they
thought
there
were
about
it
was
conjectured
that
all
the
said
poor
people
were
abiding
and
dwelling
within
thirty
miles
compass
of
in
just
as
the
tide
turned
insurrection
blazed
out
all
over
england
in
the
west
a
pitched
battle
was
fought
between
the
peasantry
and
foreign
mercenaries
and
exeter
was
relieved
only
after
a
long
siege
in
norfolk
the
yeomen
led
by
one
kett
controlled
a
large
district
for
a
considerable
time
they
arrested
the
unpopular
landlords
threw
open
the
commons
they
had
appropriated
and
ransacked
the

to
pay
indemnities
to
evicted
farmers

these
mutineers
as
certain
poor

that

have
their

and

taken
from
them
and
that
a

be
made
according
to

turned
into
cranmer
understood
the
situation
perfectly
and
though
a
consummate
courtier
and
himself
a
creation
of
the
capitalistic
revolution
spoke
in
this
way
of
his
patrons
and
they
complain
much
of
rich
men
and
gentlemen
saying
that
they
take
the
commons
from
the
poor
that
they
raise
the
prices
of
all
manner
of
things
that
they
rule
the
poverty
and
oppress
them
at
their
pleasure
and
although
here
i
seem
only
to
speak
against
these
unlawful
assemblers
yet
i
can
not
allow
those
but
i
must
needs
threaten
everlasting
damnation
unto
them
whether
they
be
gentlemen
or
whatsoever
they
be
which
never
cease
to
purchase
and
join

though
they
alone
ought
to
possess
and
inhabit
the
revolt
against
the
pressure
of
this
unrestricted
economic
competition
took
the
form
of
puritanism
of
resistance
to
the
religious
organization
controlled
by
capital
and
even
in
cranmer
s
time
the
attitude
of
the
descendants
of
the
men
who
formed
the
line
at
poitiers
and
crécy
was
so
ominous
that
anglican
bishops
took
alarm
it
is
reported
that
there
be
many
among
these
unlawful
assemblies
that
pretend
knowledge
of
the
gospel
and
will
needs
be
called
gospellers
but
now
i
will
go
further
to
speak
somewhat
of
the
great
hatred
which
divers
of
these
seditious
persons
do
bear
against
the
gentlemen
which
hatred
in
many
is
so
outrageous
that
they
desire
nothing
more
than
the
spoil
ruin
and
destruction
of
them

rich
and
somerset

owed
his
elevation
to

as

of

his

had
been
the

john
beside
inheriting
his
father
s
financial
ability
had
a
certain
aptitude
for
war
and
undoubted
courage
accordingly
he
rose
rapidly
he
and
cromwell
understood
each
other
he
flattered
cromwell
and
cromwell
lent
him
money
strype
has
intimated
that
dudley
had
strong
motives
for
resisting
the
restoration
of
the
commons
in
he
was
created
earl
of
warwick
and
in
suppressed
kett
s
rebellion
this
military
success
brought
him
to
the
head
of
the
state
he
thrust
somerset
aside
and
took
the
title
of
duke
of
northumberland
his
son
was
equally
distinguished
he
became
the
favourite
of
queen
elizabeth
who
created
him
earl
of
leicester
but
though
an
expert
courtier
he
was
one
of
the
most
incompetent
generals
whom
even
the
tudor
landed
aristocracy
ever
put
in
the
field
the
disturbances
of
the
reign
of
edward
vi
did
not
ripen
into
revolution
probably
because
of
the
relief
given
by
rising
prices
after
but
though
they
fell
short
of
actual
civil
war
they
were
sufficiently
formidable
to
terrify
the
aristocracy
into
abandoning
their
policy
of
killing
off
the
surplus
population
in
the
first
statute
was
passed
looking
toward
the
systematic
relief
of
paupers
small
farmers
prospered
greatly
after
for
prices
rose
strongly
very
much
more
strongly
than
rents
nor
was
it
until
after
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
rents
again
began
to
advance
that
the
yeomanry
once
more
grew
restive
cromwell
raised
his
ironsides
from
among
the
of
the
men
who
stormed
norwich
with
kett
i
had
a
very
worthy
friend
then
and
he
was
a
very
noble
person
and
i
know
his
memory
is
very
grateful
to
all
john
hampden
at
my
first
going
out
into
this
engagement
i
saw
our
men
were
beaten
at
every
hand
i
did
indeed
and
desired
him
that
he
would
make
some
additions
to
my
lord
essex
s
army
of
some
new
regiments
and
i
told
him
i
would
be
serviceable
to
him
in
bringing
such
men
in
as
i
thought
had
a
spirit
that
would
do
something
in
the
work
this
is
very
true
that
i
tell
you
god
knows
i
lie
not
your
troops
said
i
are
most
of
them
old
decayed
and
tapsters
and
such
kind
of
fellows
and
said
i
their
troops
are
gentlemen
s
sons
younger
sons
and
persons
of
quality
do
you
think
that
the
spirits
of
such
base
and
mean
fellows
will
ever
be
able
to
encounter
gentlemen
that
have
honour
and
courage
and
resolution
in
them
truly
i
did
tell
him
you
must
get
men
of
a
spirit
a
spirit
that
is
likely
to
go
on
as
far
as
gentlemen
will
go
or
else
you
will
be
beaten
still
he
was
a
wise
and
worthy
person
and
he
did
think
that
i
talked
a
good
notion
but
an
impracticable
one
truly
i
told
him
i
could
do
somewhat
in
it
and
truly
i
must
needs
say
this
to
you
i
raised
such
men
as
had
the
fear
of
god
before
them
as
made
some
conscience
of
what
they
did
and
from
that
day
forward
i
must
say
to
you
they
were
never
beaten
and
wherever
they
were
engaged
against
the
enemy
they
beat
thus
by
degrees
the
pressure
of
intensifying
centralization
split
the
old
homogeneous
population
of
england
into
classes
graduated
according
to
their
economic
capacity
those
without
the
necessary
instinct
sank
into
agricultural
day
labourers
whose
lot
on
the
whole
has
probably
been
somewhat
worse
than
that
of
ordinary
slaves
the
gifted
like
the
howards
the
dudleys
the
cecils
and
the
boleyns
rose
to
be
rich
nobles
and
masters
of
the
state
between
the
two
accumulated
a
mass
of
bold
and
needy
adventurers
who
were
destined
finally
not
only
to
dominate
england
but
to
shape
the
destinies
of
the
world
one
section
of
these
the
shrewder
and
less
venturesome
gravitated
to
the
towns
and
grew
rich
as
merchants
like
the
founder
of
the
osborn
family
whose
descendant
became
duke
of
leeds
or
like
the
celebrated
josiah
child
who
in
the
reign
of
william
controlled
the
whole
eastern
trade
of
the
kingdom
the
less
astute
and
the
more
martial
took
to
the
sea
and
as
slavers
pirates
and
conquerors
built
up
england
s
colonial
empire
and
established
her
maritime
supremacy
of
this
class
were
drake
and
blake
hawkins
raleigh
and
clive
for
several
hundred
years
after
the
norman
conquest
englishmen
showed
little
taste
for
the
ocean
probably
because
sufficient
outlet
for
their
energies
existed
on
land
in
the
middle
ages
the
commerce
of
the
island
was
mostly
engrossed
by
the
merchants
of
the
steelyard
an
offshoot
of
the
hanseatic
league
while
the
great
explorers
of
the
fifteenth
and
early
sixteenth
centuries
were
usually
italians
or
portuguese
men
like
columbus
vespucius
or
magellan
this
state
of
things
lasted
however
only
until
economic
competition
began
to
ruin
the
small
farmers
and
then
the
hardiest
and
boldest
race
of
europe
were
cast
adrift
and
forced
to
seek
their
fortunes
in
strange
lands
for
the
soldier
or
the
adventurer
there
was
no
opening
in
england
after
the
battle
of
flodden
a
peaceful
and
inert
bourgeoisie
more
and
more
supplanted
the
ancient
martial
baronage
their
representatives
shrank
from
campaigns
like
those
of
richard
the
edwards
and
henry
and
therefore
for
the
evicted
farmer
there
was
nothing
but
the
continents
of
america
and
asia
and
to
these
he
directed
his
steps
the
lives
of
the
admirals
tell
the
tale
on
every
page
drake
s
history
is
now
known
his
family
belonged
to
the
lesser
devon
gentry
but
fallen
so
low
that
his
father
gladly
apprenticed
him
as
ship
s
boy
on
a
channel
coaster
a
life
of
almost
intolerable
hardship
from
this
humble
beginning
he
fought
his
way
by
dint
of
courage
and
genius
to
be
one
of
england
s
three
greatest
seamen
and
blake
and
nelson
the
other
two
were
of
the
same
blood
sir
humphrey
gilbert
was
of
the
same
west
country
stock
as
drake
frobisher
was
a
poor
yorkshire
man
and
sir
walter
raleigh
came
from
a
ruined
house
no
less
than
five
knightly
branches
of
raleigh
s
family
once
throve
together
in
the
western
counties
but
disaster
came
with
the
tudors
and
walter
s
father
fell
into
trouble
through
his
puritanism
walter
himself
early
had
to
face
the
world
and
carved
out
his
fortune
with
his
sword
he
served
in
france
in
the
religious
wars
afterward
perhaps
in
flanders
then
through
gilbert
he
obtained
a
commission
in
ireland
but
finally
drifted
to
elizabeth
s
court
where
he
took
to
buccaneering
and
conceived
the
idea
of
colonizing
america
a
profound
gulf
separated
these
adventurers
from
the
landed
capitalists
for
they
were
of
an
extreme
martial
type
a
type
hated
and
feared
by
the
nobility
with
the
exception
of
the
years
of
the
commonwealth
the
landlords
controlled
england
from
the
reformation
to
the
revolution
of
a
period
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
and
during
that
long
interval
there
is
little
risk
in
asserting
that
the
aristocracy
did
not
produce
a
single
soldier
or
sailor
of
more
than
average
capacity
the
difference
between
the
royal
and
the
parliamentary
armies
was
as
great
as
though
they
had
been
recruited
from
different
races
charles
had
not
a
single
officer
of
merit
while
it
is
doubtful
if
any
force
has
ever
been
better
led
than
the
troops
organized
by
cromwell
men
like
drake
blake
and
cromwell
were
among
the
most
terrible
warriors
of
the
world
and
they
were
distrusted
and
feared
by
an
oligarchy
which
felt
instinctively
its
inferiority
in
arms
therefore
in
elizabeth
s
reign
politicians
like
the
cecils
took
care
that
the
great
seamen
should
have
no
voice
in
public
affairs
and
though
these
men
defeated
the
armada
and
though
england
owed
more
to
them
than
to
all
the
rest
of
her
population
put
together
not
one
reached
the
peerage
or
was
treated
with
confidence
and
esteem
drake
s
fate
shows
what
awaited
them
like
all
his
class
drake
was
hot
for
war
with
spain
and
from
time
to
time
he
was
unchained
when
fighting
could
not
be
averted
but
his
policy
was
rejected
his
operations
more
nearly
resembled
those
of
a
pirate
than
of
an
admiral
and
when
he
died
he
died
in
something
like
disgrace
the
aristocracy
even
made
the
false
position
in
which
they
placed
their
sailors
a
source
of
profit
for
they
forced
them
to
buy
pardon
for
their
victories
by
surrendering
the
treasure
they
had
won
with
their
blood
fortescue
actually
had
to
interfere
to
defend
raleigh
and
hawkins
from
elizabeth
s
rapacity
in
borough
sailed
in
command
of
a
squadron
fitted
out
by
the
two
latter
with
some
contribution
from
the
queen
and
the
city
of
london
borough
captured
the
carack
the
whose
pepper
alone
burleigh
estimated
at
the
cargo
proved
worth
and
of
this
elizabeth
s
share
according
to
the
rule
of
distribution
in
use
amounted
to
or
she
demanded
and
allowed
raleigh
and
hawkins
who
had
spent
only
raleigh
bitterly
contrasted
the
difference
made
between
himself
a
soldier
and
a
peer
or
a
london
speculator
i
was
the
cause
that
all
this
came
to
the
queen
and
that
the
king
of
spaine
spent
li
the
last
yere
i
that
adventured
all
my
estate
lose
of
my
principall
i
tooke
all
the
care
and
paines
they
only
sate
still
for
which
double
is
given
to
them
and
less
then
mine
own
to
raleigh
was
so
brave
he
could
not
comprehend
that
his
talent
was
his
peril
he
fancied
his
capacity
for
war
would
bring
him
fame
and
fortune
and
it
led
him
to
the
block
while
elizabeth
lived
the
admiration
of
the
woman
for
the
hero
probably
saved
him
but
he
never
even
entered
the
privy
council
and
of
real
power
he
had
none
the
sovereign
the
oligarchy
chose
was
james
and
james
imprisoned
and
then
slew
him
nor
was
raleigh
s
fate
peculiar
for
through
timidity
the
cavaliers
conceived
an
almost
equal
hate
of
many
soldiers
they
dug
up
the
bones
of
cromwell
they
tried
to
murder
william
and
they
dragged
down
marlborough
in
the
midst
of
victory
such
were
the
new
classes
into
which
economic
competition
divided
the
people
of
england
during
the
sixteenth
century
and
the
reformation
was
only
one
among
many
of
the
effects
of
this
profound
social
revolution
in
the
first
years
of
the
sixteenth
century
england
passed
through
two
distinct
phases
of
ecclesiastical
reform
the
earlier
under
henry
when
the
conventual
property
was
appropriated
by
the
rising
aristocracy
the
later
under
edward
when
portions
of
the
secular
endowments
were
also
seized
each
period
of
spoliation
was
accompanied
by
innovations
in
doctrine
and
each
was
followed
by
a
reaction
the
final
one
under
mary
taking
the
form
of
reconciliation
with
rome
viewed
in
connection
with
the
insurrections
the
whole
movement
can
hardly
be
distinguished
from
an
armed
conquest
of
the
imaginative
by
the
economic
section
of
society
a
conquest
which
produced
a
most
curious
and
interesting
development
of
a
new
clerical
type
during
the
middle
ages
the
hierarchy
had
been
a
body
of
independent
of
and
at
first
superior
to
the
state
this
great
corporation
had
subsisted
upon
its
own
resources
and
had
generally
been
controlled
by
men
of
the
ecstatic
temperament
of
whom
saint
anselm
is
perhaps
the
most
perfect
example
after
the
conquest
at
the
reformation
these
conditions
changed
having
lost
its
independence
the
priesthood
lapsed
into
an
adjunct
of
the
civil
power
it
then
became
reorganized
upon
an
economic
basis
and
gradually
turned
into
a
salaried
class
paid
to
inculcate
obedience
to
the
representative
of
an
oligarchy
which
controlled
the
national
revenue
perhaps
in
all
modern
history
there
is
no
more
striking
example
of
the
rapid
and
complete
manner
in
which
under
favourable
circumstances
one
type
can
supersede
another
than
the
thoroughness
with
which
the
economic
displaced
the
emotional
temperament
in
the
anglican
church
during
the
tudor
dynasty
the
mental
processes
of
the
new
pastors
did
not
differ
so
much
in
degree
as
in
kind
from
those
of
the
old
although
the
spoliations
of
edward
are
less
well
remembered
than
those
of
his
father
they
were
hardly
less
drastic
they
began
with
the
estates
of
the
chantries
and
guilds
and
rapidly
extended
to
all
sorts
of
property
in
the
middle
ages
one
of
the
chief
sources
of
revenue
of
the
sacred
class
had
been
their
prayers
for
souls
in
purgatory
and
all
large
churches
contained
chapels
many
of
them
richly
endowed
for
the
perpetual
celebration
of
masses
for
the
dead
in
england
and
wales
more
than
a
thousand
such
chapels
existed
whose
revenues
were
often
very
valuable
these
were
the
chantries
which
vanished
with
the
imaginative
age
which
created
them
and
the
guilds
shared
the
same
fate
before
economic
competition
had
divided
men
into
classes
according
to
their
financial
capacity
all
craftsmen
possessed
capital
as
all
agriculturists
held
land
the
guild
established
the
craftsman
s
social
status
as
a
member
of
a
trade
corporation
he
was
governed
by
regulations
fixing
the
number
of
hands
he
might
employ
the
amount
of
goods
he
might
produce
and
the
quality
of
his
workmanship
on
the
other
hand
the
guild
regulated
the
market
and
ensured
a
demand
tradesmen
perhaps
did
not
easily
grow
rich
but
they
as
seldom
became
poor
with
centralization
life
changed
competition
sifted
the
strong
from
the
weak
the
former
waxed
wealthy
and
hired
hands
at
wages
the
latter
lost
all
but
the
ability
to
labour
and
when
the
corporate
body
of
producers
had
thus
disintegrated
nothing
stood
between
the
common
property
and
the
men
who
controlled
the
engine
of
the
law
by
the
edward
all
the
possessions
of
the
schools
colleges
and
guilds
of
england
except
the
colleges
of
oxford
and
cambridge
and
the
guilds
of
london
were
conveyed
to
the
king
and
the
distribution
thus
begun
extended
far
and
wide
and
has
been
forcibly
described
by
blunt
they
tore
off
the
lead
from
the
roofs
and
wrenched
out
the
brasses
from
the
floors
the
books
they
despoiled
of
their
costly
covers
and
then
sold
them
for
waste
paper
the
gold
and
silver
plate
they
melted
down
with
copper
and
lead
to
make
a
coinage
so
shamefully
debased
as
was
never
known
before
or
since
in
england
the
vestments
of
altars
and
priests
they
turned
into
carpets
and
hangings
when
not
very
costly
and
when
worth
more
money
than
usual
they
sold
them
to
foreigners
not
caring
who
used
them
for
superstitious
purposes
but
caring
to
make
the
best
bargains
they
could
of
their
spoil
even
the
very
surplices
and
altar
linen
would
fetch
something
and
that
too
was
seized
by
their
covetous
these
covetous
hands
were
the
privy
councillors
henry
had
not
intended
that
any
member
of
the
board
should
have
precedence
but
the
king
s
body
was
not
cold
before
edward
seymour
began
an
intrigue
to
make
himself
protector
to
consolidate
a
party
behind
him
he
opened
his
administration
by
distributing
all
the
spoil
he
could
lay
hands
on
and
froude
estimated
that
on
a
computation
most
favourable
to
the
council
estates
worth
in
modern
currency
about
five
millions
of
pounds
were
appropriated
i
suppose
i
must
not
say
stolen
and
divided
among
at
the
head
of
this
council
stood
cranmer
who
took
his
share
without
scruple
probably
froude
s
estimate
is
far
too
low
for
though
seymour
as
duke
of
somerset
had
like
henry
to
meet
imperative
claims
which
drained
his
purse
he
yet
built
somerset
house
the
most
sumptuous
palace
of
london
seymour
was
put
to
death
by
dudley
when
he
rose
to
power
by
his
military
success
in
norfolk
dudley
as
well
as
cromwell
was
fitted
for
the
emergency
in
which
he
lived
bold
able
unscrupulous
and
energetic
his
party
hated
but
followed
him
because
without
him
they
saw
no
way
to
seize
the
property
they
coveted
he
too
like
cromwell
allied
himself
with
the
evangelical
clergy
and
under
edward
the
orthodoxy
of
the
six
articles
gave
way
to
the
doctrine
of
geneva
even
in
calvin
had
been
able
to
write
to
somerset
thanking
god
that
through
his
wisdom
the
pure
truth
was
preached
but
when
dudley
administered
the
government
as
duke
of
northumberland
bishops
did
not
hesitate
to
teach
that
the
dogma
of
the
carnal
presence
in
the
sacrament
maintaineth
that
beastly
kind
of
cruelty
of
the
anthropophagi
that
is
the
devourers
of
man
s
flesh
for
it
is
a
more
cruel
thing
to
devour
a
quick
man
than
to
slay
dudley
resembled
henry
and
norfolk
in
being
naturally
conservative
for
he
died
a
catholic
but
with
them
all
money
was
the
supreme
object
and
as
they
lacked
the
physical
force
to
plunder
alone
they
were
obliged
to
conciliate
the
radicals
these
were
represented
by
knox
and
to
knox
the
duke
paid
assiduous
court
the
scotchman
began
preaching
in
berwick
in
but
the
government
soon
brought
him
to
london
and
in
made
him
a
royal
chaplain
and
as
chaplain
he
was
called
upon
to
approve
the
articles
of
this
he
could
do
conscientiously
as
they
contained
the
dogmas
of
election
and
predestination
original
sin
and
justification
by
faith
beside
a
denial
of
the
reall
and
bodilie
presence
of
christes
fleshe
and
bloude
in
the
sacramente
of
the
lordes
dudley
tried
hard
to
buy
knox
and
offered
him
the
see
of
rochester
but
the
duke
excited
the
deepest
distrust
and
dislike
in
the
preacher
who
called
him
that
wretched
and
miserable
he
rejected
the
preferment
and
indeed
from
the
beginning
bad
blood
seems
to
have
lain
between
the
calvinists
and
the
court
writing
at
the
beginning
of
knox
expressed
his
opinion
of
the
reforming
aristocracy
in
emphatic
language
beginning
with
somerset
who
became
so
cold
in
hearing
godis

that
the

finally
just
before

death
the
open
rupture

knox
had
a
supreme
contempt
and
antipathy
for
the
lord

paulet

of

whom
he
called

now
that

it

and
in
the
last
sermon
he
preached
before
the

he
let
loose

and
probably
he
would
have
quitted
the

even
had
the

continued
in
this
sermon
dudley

not
in

corner
as
many
yet
can
wytnesse
but
even
before
those
whome
my
conscience
judged
worthy
of
knox
understood
the
relation
which
men
of
his
stamp
bore
to
anglicanism
in
much
land
yet
remained
to
be
divided
therefore
he
and
his
like
were
flattered
and
cajoled
until
paulet
and
his
friends
should
be
strong
enough
to
discard
them
faith
in
the
hands
of
the
monied
oligarchy
became
an
instrument
of
police
and
from
the
reformation
downward
revelation
has
been
expounded
in
england
by
statute
hence
men
of
the
imaginative
type
who
could
not
accept
their
creed
with
their
stipend
were
at
any
moment
in
danger
of
being
adjudged
heretics
and
suffering
the
extreme
penalty
of
insubordination
docility
to
lay
dictation
has
always
been
the
test
by
which
the
anglican
clergy
have
been
sifted
from
catholics
and
puritans
to
the
imaginative
mind
a
faith
must
spring
from
a
revelation
and
a
revelation
must
be
infallible
and
unchangeable
truth
must
be
single
catholics
believed
their
revelation
to
be
continuous
delivered
through
the
mouth
of
an
illuminated
priesthood
speaking
in
its
corporate
capacity
puritans
held
that
theirs
had
been
made
once
for
all
and
was
contained
in
a
book
but
both
catholics
and
puritans
were
clear
that
divine
truth
was
immutable
and
that
the
universal
church
could
not
err
to
minds
of
this
type
statutes
regulating
the
appearance
of
god
s
body
in
the
elements
were
not
only
impious
but
absurd
and
men
of
the
priestly
temperament
whether
catholic
or
puritan
have
faced
death
in
its
most
appalling
forms
rather
than
bow
down
before
them
here
fisher
and
knox
bellarmine
and
calvin
agreed
rather
than
accept
the
royal
supremacy
the
flower
of
the
english
priesthood
sought
poverty
and
exile
the
scaffold
and
the
stake
for
this
the
aged

hastened
to
the
block
on

for
this
forest

over
the
embers
of
the
smouldering
rood
for
this
the
carthusians
rotted
in
their
noisome
dens
nor
were
puritans
a
whit
behind
catholics

asserting
the
sacerdotal
dignity

downward
the
writings
of
martin
marprelate
only
restated
an
issue
which
had
been
raised
by
hildebrand
five
hundred
years
before
for
the
advance
of
centralization
had
reproduced
in
england
something
of
the
same
conditions
which
prevailed
at
constantinople
when
it
became
a
centre
of
exchanges
wherever
civilization
has
reached
the
point
at
which
energy
expresses
itself
through
money
faith

be
subordinate

stephen
gardiner
understood
the
conditions
under
which
he
lived
and
accepted
his
servitude
in
consideration
of
the
great
see
of
winchester
with
striking
acuteness
he
cited
justinian
as
a
precedent
for
henry
then
sir
who
did
ever
disallow
justinian
s
fact
that
made
laws
concerning
the
glorious
trinity
and
the
catholic
faith
of
bishops
of
men
of
the
clergy
of
heretics
and
others
such
like
from
the
day
of
the
breach
with
rome
the
british
priesthood
sank
into
and
those
of
the
ancient
clergy
who
remained
in
the
anglican
hierarchy
after
the
reformation
acquiesced
in
their
position
as
appeared
in
all
their
writings
but
in
none
perhaps
more
strikingly
than
in
the
formularies
of
faith
of
henry
where
the
episcopal
bench
submitted
their
views
of
orthodoxy
to
the
revision
of
the
secular
power
and
albeit
most
dread
and
benign
sovereign
lord
we
do
affirm
by
our
learnings
with
one
assent
that
the
said
treatise
is
in
all
points
so
concordant
and
agreeable
to
holy
scripture
as
we
trust
your
majesty
shall
receive
the
same
as
a
thing
most
sincerely
and
purely
handled
to
the
glory
of
god
your
grace
s
honour
the
unity
of
your
people
the
which
things
your
highness
we
may
well
see
and
perceive
doth
chiefly
in
the

desire
yet
we
do
most
humbly
submit
it
to
the
most
excellent
wisdom
and
exact
judgment
of
your
majesty
to
be
recognised
overseen
and
corrected
if
your
grace
shall
find
any
word
or
sentence
in
it
meet
to
be
changed
qualified
or
further
expounded
for
the
plain
setting
forth
of
your
highness
s
most
virtuous
desire
and
purpose
in
that
behalf
whereunto
we
shall
in
that
case
conform
ourselves
as
to
our
most
bounden
duties
to

and
to
your
highness

thomas
cantuarien
and
all
the
bishops
a
church
thus
lying
at
the
mercy
of
the
temporal
power
became
a
chattel
in
the
hands
of
the
class
which
controlled
the
revenue
and
from
the
reformation
to
the
revolution
of
this
class
consisted
of
a
comparatively
few
great
landed
families
forming
a
narrow
oligarchy
which
guided
the
crown
in
the
middle
ages
a
king
had
drawn
his
army
from
his
own
domain
had
his
own
means
of
attack
and
defence
like
any
other
baron
only
on
a
larger
scale
henry
on
the
contrary
stood
alone
and
helpless
as
centralization
advanced
the
cost
of
administration
grew
until
regular
taxation
had
become
necessary
and
yet
taxes
could
only
be
levied
by
parliament
the
king
could
hardly
pay
a
and
such
military
force
as
existed
within
the
realm
obeyed
the
landlords
had
it
not
been
for
a
few
opulent
nobles
like
norfolk
and
shrewsbury
the
pilgrims
of
grace
might
have
marched
to
london
and
plucked
henry
from
his
throne
as
easily
as
william
afterward
plucked
james
these
landlords
together
with
the
london
tradesmen
carried
henry
through
the
crisis
of
and
thereafter
he
lay
in
their
hands
his
impotence
appeared
in
every
act
of
his
reign
he
ran
the
risk
and
paid
the
price
while
others
fattened
on
the
plunder
the
howards
the
cecils
the
russells
the
dudleys
divided
the
church
spoil
among
themselves
and
wrung
from
the
crown
its
last
penny
so
that
henry
lived
in
debt
and
edward
faced
insolvency
deeply
as
mary
abhorred
sacrilege
she
dared
not
ask
for
restitution
to
the
abbeys
such
a
step
would
probably
have
caused
her
overthrow
while
elizabeth
never
attempted
opposition
but
obeyed
cecil
the
incarnation
of
the
spirit
of
the
oligarchy
the
men
who
formed
this
oligarchy
were
of
totally
different
type
from
anything
which
flourished
in
england
in
the
imaginative
age
unwarlike
for
their
insular
position
made
it
possible
for
them
to
survive
without
the
martial
quality
they
always
shrank
from
arms
nor
were
they
numerous
enough
or
strong
enough
to
overawe
the
nation
even
in
quiet
times
accordingly
they
generally
lay
inert
and
only
from
necessity
allied
themselves
with
some
more
turbulent
faction
the
tudor
aristocracy
were
rich
phlegmatic
and
unimaginative
men
in
whom
the
other
faculties
were
subordinated
to
acquisition
and
they
treated
their
religion
as
a
financial
investment
strictly
speaking
the
church
of
england
never
had
a
faith
but
vibrated
between
the
orthodoxy
of
the
six
articles
and
the
calvinism
of
the
lambeth
articles
according
to
the
exigencies
of
real
estate
within
a
single
generation
the
relation
christ
s
flesh
and
blood
bore
to
the
bread
and
wine
was
changed
five
times
by
royal
proclamation
or
act
of
parliament
but
if
creeds
were
alike
to
the
new
economic
aristocracy
it
well
understood
the
value
of
the
pulpit
as
a
branch
of
the
police
of
the
kingdom
and
from
the
outset
it
used
the
clergy
as
part
of
the
secular
administration
on
this
point
cranmer
was
explicit
elizabeth
probably
represented
the
landed
gentry
more
perfectly
than
any
other
sovereign
and
she
told
her
bishops
plainly
that
she
cared
little
for
doctrine
but
wanted
clerks
to
keep
order
she
remarked
that
she
had
seen
it
said
that
hir
protestants
themselves
misliked
hir
and
in
deede
so
they
doe
quoth
she
for
i
have
heard
that
some
of
them
of
late
have
said
that
i
was
of
no
religion
neither
hot
nor
cold
but
such
a
one
as
one
day
would
give
god
the
vomit
after
this
she
wished
the
bishops
to
look
unto
private
conventicles
and
now
quoth
she
i
miss
my
lord
of
london
who
looketh
no
better
unto
the
citty
where
every
merchant
must
have
his
schoolemaster
and
nightly
elizabeth
ruled
her
clergy
with
a
rod
of
iron
no
priest
was
allowed
to
marry
without
the
approbation
of
two
justices
of
the
peace
beside
the
bishop
nor
the
head
of
a
college
without
the
leave
of
the
visitor
when
the
dean
of
paul
s
offended
the
queen
in
his
sermon
she
told
him
to
retire
from
that
ungodly
digression
and
return
to
his
text
and
grindall
was
suspended
for
disobedience
to
her
orders
in
grindall
s
primacy
monthly
prayer
meetings
called
prophesyings
came
into
fashion
among
the
clergy
for
some
reason
these
meetings
gave
the
government
offence
and
grindall
was
directed
to
put
a
stop
to
them
attacked
thus
in
the
priests
dearest
rights
the
archbishop
refused
without
more
ado
the
old
prelate
was
suspended
nor
was
he
pardoned
until
he
made
submission
five
years
later
the
correspondence
of
the
elizabethan
bishops
is
filled
with
accounts
of
their
thraldom
pilkington
among
others
complained
that
we
are
under
authority
and
can
not
make
any
innovation
without
the
sanction
of
the
queen
and
the
only
alternative
now
allowed
us
is
whether
we
will
bear
with
these
things
or
disturb
the
peace
of
the
even
ecclesiastical
property
continued
to
be
seized
where
it
could
be
taken
safely
and
the
story
of
ely
house
although
it
has
been
denied
is
authentic
in
spirit
from
the
beginning
of
the
reformation
the
london
palaces
of
the
bishops
had
been
a
tempting
prize
henry
took
york
house
for
himself
raleigh
had
a
lease
of
durham
house
and
about
sir
christopher
hatton
whose
relations
with
the
queen
were
hardly
equivocal
undertook
to
force
bishop
cox
to
convey
him
ely
house
the
bishop
resisted
hatton
applied
to
the
queen
and
she
is
said
to
have
cut
the
matter
short
thus
proud
prelate
i
understand
you
are
backward
in
complying
with
your
agreement
but
i
would
have
you
know
that

what

can
unmake

if

either
stronger
so
as
to
have
controlled
the
blouse
of

or
more
military
so
as
to
have
suppressed
it
english
ecclesiastical
development
would
have
been
different
as
it
was
a
knot
of
ruling
families
gorged
with
plunder

between
the
catholics
and
the
more
fortunate
of
the
evicted
yeomen
who
had
made
money
by
trade
and
who
hated
and
competed
with
them
puritans
as
well
as
catholics
sought
to
unsettle
titles
to

lands
it
is
wonderfull
to
see
how
dispitefully
they
write
of
this
matter
they
call

as

defence
they
organized
a
body
of

to

and
teach
the
divine
right
of
primogeniture
which
became
the
distinctive
dogma
of
this
national
church
such
at

was
the
opinion
of
the
who
have
always
ranked
among
the
most
orthodox
of

anglican

the

statement

the
religion
of

it
in

now
if
so

me
to
have
dyed
so
though
at
a
stake
and
whereas
that
religion
of
the
church
of
england
taught
me
the
doctrine
of
and
passive
obedience
which
i
have
accordingly
inculcated
upon
others
and
which
i
took
to
be
the
distinguishing
character
of
the
church
of
england
i
adhere
no
less
firmly
and
steadfastly
to
that
and

it

force
so
predominant
that
the
process
had
become
reversed
and
the
priesthood
attributed
its
prerogative
to
speak
in
the
name
of
the
deity
to
the
interposition
of
the
king
this
was
the
substance
of
the
reformation
in
england
cranmer
taught
that
god
committed
to
christian
princes
the
whole
cure
of
all
their
subjects
as
well
concerning
the
administration
of
god
s
word
as
of
things
political
therefore
bishops
parsons
and
vicars
were
ministers
of
the
temporal
ruler
to
whom
he
confided
the
ecclesiastical
office
as
he
confided
the
enforcement
of
order
to
a
chief
of
police
as
a
part
of
the
secular
administration
the
main
function
of
the
reformed
priesthood
was
to
preach
obedience
to
their
patrons
and
the
doctrine
they
evolved
has
been
thus
summed
up
by
macaulay
it
was
gravely
maintained
that
the
supreme
being
regarded
hereditary
monarchy
as
opposed
to
other
forms
of
government
with
peculiar
favour
that
the
rule
of
succession
in
order
of
primogeniture
was
a
divine
institution
anterior
to
the
christian
and
even
to
the
mosaic
dispensation
that
no
human
power
could
deprive
a
legitimate
prince
of
his
rights
that
the
authority
of
such
a
prince
was
necessarily
always
despotic
in
no
other
department
of
public
affairs
did
the
landed
gentry
show
particular
energy
or
ability
their
army
was
ineffective
their
navy
unequal
to
its
work
their
finances
indifferently
handled
but
down
to
the
time
of
their
overthrow
in
they
were
eminently
successful
in
ecclesiastical
organization
they
chose
their
instruments
with
precision
and
an
oligarchy
has
seldom
been
more
adroitly
served
macaulay
was
a
practical
politician
and
macaulay
rated
the
clergy
as
the
chief
political
power
under
charles
ii
at
every
important
conjuncture
invectives
against
the
whigs
and
exhortations
to
obey
the
lord
s
anointed
resounded
at
once
from
many
thousands
of
pulpits
and
the
effect
was
formidable
indeed
of
all
the
causes
which
after
the
dissolution
of
the
oxford
parliament
produced
the
violent
reaction
against
the
exclusionists
the
most
potent
seems
to
have
been
the
oratory
of
the
country
for
country
squires
a
clergy
was
safe
and
although
macaulay
s
famous
passage
describing
their
fear
of
an
army
has
met
with
contradiction
it
probably
is
true
in
their
minds
a
standing
army
was
inseparably
associated
with
the
rump
with
the
protector
with
the
spoliation
of
the
church
with
the
purgation
of
the
universities
with
the
abolition
of
the
peerage
with
the
murder
of
the
king
with
the
sullen
reign
of
the
saints
with
cant
and
asceticism
with
fines
and
sequestrations
with
the
insults
which
major
generals
sprung
from
the
dregs
of
the
people
had
offered
to
the
oldest
and
most
honourable
families
of
the
kingdom
there
was
moreover
scarcely
a
baronet
or
a
squire
in
the
parliament
who
did
not
owe
part
of
his
importance
in
his
own
county
to
his
rank
in
the
militia
if
that
national
force
were
set
aside
the
gentry
of
england
must
lose
much
of
their
dignity
and
the
work
to
be
done
by
the
tudor
hierarchy
was
mercenary
not
imaginative
therefore
pastors
had
to
be
chosen
who
could
be
trusted
to
labour
faithfully
for
wages
perhaps
no
equally
large
and
intelligent
body
of
men
has
ever
been
more
skilfully
selected
the
anglican
priests
as
a
body
have
uniformly
been
true
to
the
hand
which
fed
them
without
regard
to
the
principles
they
were
required
to
preach
a
remarkable
instance
of
their
docility
where
loss
of
income
was
the
penalty
for
disobedience
was
furnished
at
the
accession
of
william
and
mary
divine
right
was
of
course
the
most
sacred
of
anglican
dogmas
and
yet
when
the
clergy
were
commanded
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
him
whom
they
held
to
be
an
usurper
as
macaulay
has
observed
some
of
the
strongest
motives
which
can
influence
the
human
mind
had
prevailed
above
thirtieths
of
the
profession
submitted
to
the
moreover
the
landlords
had
the
economic
instinct
bargaining
accordingly
and
elizabeth
bluntly
told
her
bishops
that
they
must
get
her
sober
respectable
preachers
but
men
who
should
be
cheap
then
spake
my
lord
treasurer
her
maty
hath
declared
unto
you
a
marvellous
great
fault
in
that
you
make
in
this
time
of
light
so
many
lewd
and
unlearned
ministers
it
is
the
bishop
of
litchfield
that
i
mean
who
made
lxx
ministers
in
one
day
for
money
some
taylors
some
shoemakers
and
other
craftsmen
i
am
sure
the
greatest
part
of
them
not
worthy
to
keep
horses
then
said
the
bp
of
rochester
that
may
be
so
for
i
know
one
that
made
in
one
day
i
would
every
man
might
beare
his
own
burthen
some
of
us
have
the
greatest
wrong
that
can
be
offred
but
my
lord
if
you
would
have
none
but
learned
preachers
to
be
admitted
into
the
ministery
you
must
provide
better
livings
for
them
to
have
learned
ministers
in
every
parish
is
in
my
t
impossible
quoth
my
ld
of
canterbury
being
parishes
in
ingland
i
know
not
how
this
realm
should
yield
so
many
learned
preachers
jesus
quoth
the
queen
it
is
not
to
be
looked
for
i
thinke
the
time
hath
been
there
hath
not
been
preachers
in
a
diocesse
my
meaning
is
not
you
should
make
choice
of
learned
ministers
only
for
they
are
not
to
be
found
but
of
honest
sober
and
wise
men
and
such
as
can
reade
the
scriptures
and
homilies
well
unto
the
the
anglican
clergy
under
the
tudors
and
the
stuarts
were
not
so
much
priests
in
the
sense
of
the
twelfth
century
as
hired
political
retainers
macaulay
s
celebrated
description
is
too
well
known
to
need
full
quotation
for
one
who
made
the
figure
of
a
gentleman
ten
were
mere
menial
servants
the
coarse
and
ignorant
squire
could
hire
a
young
levite
for
his
board
a
small
garret
and
ten
pounds
a
year
this
clergyman
might
not
only
be
the
most
patient
of
butts
and
of
listeners
might
not
only
be
always
ready
in
fine
weather
for
bowls
and
in
rainy
weather
for
shovelboard
but
might
also
save
the
expense
of
a
gardener
or
of
a
groom
sometimes
the
reverend
man
nailed
up
the
apricots
and
sometimes
he
curried
the
coach
yet
as
macaulay
has
also
pointed
out
the
hierarchy
was
divided
into
two
sections
the
ordinary
labourers
and
the
managers
the
latter
were
indispensable
to
the
aristocracy
since
without
them
their
machine
could
hardly
have
been
kept
in
motion
and
these
were
men
of
talent
who
demanded
and
received
good
wages
probably
for
this
reason
a
large
revenue
was
reserved
for
the
higher
secular
clergy
and
from
the
outset
the
policy
proved
successful
many
of
the
ablest
organizers
and
astutest
politicians
of
england
during
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
sat
on
the
episcopal
bench
and
two
of
the
most
typical
as
well
as
the
ablest
anglicans
who
ever
lived
were
the
two
eminent
bishops
who
led
the
opposing
wings
of
the
church
when
it
was
reformed
by
henry
viii
stephen
gardiner
and
thomas
cranmer
gardiner
was
the
son
of
a
clothworker
of
bury
saint
edmunds
and
was
born
about
at
cambridge
he
made
himself
the
best
civil
lawyer
of
the
kingdom
and
on
meeting
wolsey
so
strongly
impressed
him
with
his
talent
that
the
cardinal
advanced
him
rapidly
and
in
january
sent
him
to
negotiate
for
the
divorce
at
rome
nobody
doubts
that
to
the
end
of
his
life
gardiner
remained
a
sincere
catholic
but
above
all
else
he
was
a
great
anglican
becoming
secretary
to
the
king
in
june
as
wolsey
was
tottering
to
his
fall
he
laboured
to
bring
the
university
of
cambridge
to
the
royal
side
and
he
also
devoted
himself
to
anne
until
he
obtained
the
see
of
winchester
when
his
efforts
for
the
divorce
slackened
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
assure
clement
that
he
had
repented
and
meant
to
quit
the
court
but
notwithstanding
he
bore
up
the
laps
of
anne
s
robe
at
her
coronation
in
the
ways
parted
a
decision
could
not
be
deferred
he
renounced
rome
and
preached
his
sermon
de
vera
obedientia
in
which
he
recognized
in
henry
the
supremacy
of
a
byzantine
emperor
the
pang
this
act
cost
him
lasted
till
he
died
and
he
told
the
papal
nuncio
he
made
this
book
under
compulsion
not
having
the
strength
to
suffer
death
patiently
which
was
ready
for
indeed
when
dying
his
apostacy
seems
to
have
been
his
last
thought
for
in
his
closing
hours
as
the
story
of
the
passion
was
read
to
him
he
exclaimed
negavi
cum
petro
exivi
cum
petro
sed
nondum
flevi
cum
all
his
life
long
his
enemies
accused
him
of
dissimulation
and
hypocrisy
for
acts
like
these
but
it
was
precisely
this
quality
which
raised
him
to
eminence
had
he
not
been
purchasable
he
could
hardly
have
survived
as
an
anglican
bishop
an
enthusiast
like
fisher
would
have
ended
on
tower
hill
perhaps
more
fully
than
any
other
prelate
of
his
time
gardiner
represented
the
faction
of
henry
and
norfolk
he
was
as
orthodox
as
he
could
be
and
yet
prosper
he
hated
cromwell
and
all
gospellers
and
he
loved
power
and
splendour
and
office
fisher
with
the
temperament
of
saint
anselm
shivering
in
his
squalid
house
clad
in
his
shirt
of
hair
and
sleeping
on
his
pallet
of
straw
might
indeed
humbly
thank
the
king
s
majesty
who
rid
him
of
all
this
worldly
business
but
men
who
rose
to
eminence
in
the
reformed
church
were
made
of
different
stuff
and
gardiner
s
ruling
passion
never
burned
more
fiercely
than
as
he
neared
his
death
though
in
excruciating
torments
from
disease
he
clung
to
office
to
the
last
noailles
the
french
ambassador
at
a
last
interview
found
him
livid
with
jaundice
and
bursting
with
dropsy
but
for
two
hours
he
held
discourse
with
me
calmly
and
graciously
without
a
sign
of
discomposure
and
at
parting
he
must
needs
take
my
arm
and
walk
through
three
saloons
on
purpose
to
show
himself
to
the
people
because
they
said
that
he
was
gardiner
was
a
man
born
to
be
a
great
prelate
under
a
monied
oligarchy
but
gifted
as
he
surely
was
he
must
yield
in
glory
to
that
wonderful
archbishop
who
stamped
the
impress
of
his
mind
so
deeply
on
the
sect
he
loved
and
whom
most
anglicans
would
probably
call
with
canon
dixon
the
first
clergyman
of
his
age
cranmer
was
so
supremely
fitted
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
economic
revolution
in
which
he
lived
that
he
rose
at
a
bound
from
insignificance
to
what
was
for
an
englishman
the
summit
of
greatness
in
when
the
breach
came
gardiner
already
held
the
place
of
chief
secretary
while
cranmer
remained
a
poor
fellow
of
jesus
within
four
years
he
had
been
consecrated
primate
and
he
had
bought
his
preferment
by
swearing
allegiance
to
the
pope
though
he
knew
himself
promoted
for
the
express
purpose
of
violating
his
oath
by
decreeing
the
divorce
which
should
sever
england
from
rome
his
qualities
were
all
recognized
by
his
contemporaries
his
adroitness
his
trustworthiness
and
his
flexibility
such
an
archbishop
so
nominated
and
so
and
in
such
wise
consecrated
was
a
meet
instrument
for
the
king
to
work
by
a
meet
cover
for
such
a
cup
neither
was
there
ever
that
might
more
command
his
bears
than
the
king
might
command
this
judgment
has
always
been
held
by
churchmen
to
be
no
small
claim
to
fame
burnet
for
example
himself
a
bishop
and
an
admirer
of
his
eminent
predecessor
was
clear
that
cranmer
s
strength
lay
in
that
mixture
of
intelligence
and
servility
which
made
him
useful
to
those
who
paid
him
cranmer
s
great
interest
with
the
king
was
chiefly
grounded
on
some
opinions
he
had
of
the
ecclesiastical
officers
being
as
much
subject
to
the
king
s
power
as
all
other
civil
officers
were
but
there
was
this
difference
that
cranmer
was
once
of
that
opinion
but
bonner
against
his
conscience
if
he
had
any
complied
with
the
genius
of
the
archbishop
as
a
courtier
may
be
measured
by
the
fate
which
overtook
his
contemporaries
he
was
the
fourth
of
henry
s
great
ministers
of
whom
cromwell
norfolk
and
wolsey
were
the
other
three
wolsey
was
disgraced
plundered
and
hounded
to
death
cromwell
was
beheaded
and
norfolk
was
on
his
way
to
the
scaffold
when
saved
by
the
death
of
the
man
who
condemned
him
the
priest
alone
as
lutheran
or
as
worshipper
of
the
miracle
which
he
afterward
denied
always
kept
the
sunshine
of
favour
burnet
has
described
how
readily
he
violated
his
oath
by
participating
in
the
attempt
to
change
the
succession
under
edward
he
stood
firm
and
said
that
he
could
not
subscribe
it
without
perjury
having
sworn
to
the
observance
of
king
henry
s
will
the
king
himself
required
him
to
set
his
hand
to
the
will
it
grieved
him
much
but
such
was
the
love
that
he
bore
to
the
king
that
in
conclusion
he
yielded
and
signed
like
the
chameleon
he
changed
his
colour
to
match
the
force
which
upheld
him
under
edward
he
became
radical
as
easily
as
he
had
sung
the
mass
under
the
six
articles
or
as
under
mary
he
pleaded
to
be
allowed
to
return
to
rome
nor
did
he
act
thus
from
cowardice
for
when
he
went
to
the
fire
not
a
martyr
of
the
reformation
showed
more
constancy
than
he
with
hardly
an
exception
cranmer
s
contemporaries
suffered
because
they
could
not
entirely
divest
themselves
of
their
scruples
even
gardiner
had
convictions
strong
enough
to
lodge
him
in
the
tower
and
bonner
ended
his
days
in
the
marshalsea
rather
than
abjure
again
under
elizabeth
but
no
such
weakness
hampered
cranmer
at
oxford
before
his
execution
he
recanted
in
various
forms
very
many
times
and
would
doubtless
have
gone
on
recanting
could
he
have
saved
himself
by
so
doing
unlike
gardiner
his
convictions
were
evangelical
and
he
probably
imbibed
reformed
principles
quite
early
for
he
married
ossiander
s
niece
when
in
germany
before
he
became
archbishop
characteristically
enough
he
voted
for
the
six
articles
in
deference
to
henry
although
the
third
section
of
the
act
provided
death
and
forfeiture
of
goods
for
any
priest
who
might
marry
afterward
he
had
to
conceal
his
wife
and
carry
her
from
place
to
place
hidden
from
sight
in
a
cranmer
alleged
at
his
trial
that
he
had
stayed
orthodox
regarding
the
sacrament
until
ridley
had
converted
him
after
henry
s
death
but
leaving
out
of
consideration
the
improbability
of
a
man
of
cranmer
s
remarkable
acuteness
being
influenced
by
ridley
the
judgment
of
such
a
man
as
foxe
should
have
weight
certainly
foxe
thought
him
a
gospeller
at
the
time
of
lambert
s
trial
and
nothing
can
give
so
vivid
an
idea
of
the
lengths
to
which
men
of
the
anglican
type
were
ready
to
go
as
the
account
given
by
foxe
of
the
martyrdom
of
this
sectary
lambert
i
answer
with
saint
augustine
that
it
is
the
body
of
christ
after
a
certain
the
king
answer
me
neither
out
of
saint
augustine
nor
by
the
authority
of
any
other
but
tell
me
plainly
whether
thou
sayest
it
is
the
body
of
christ
or
lambert
then
i
deny
it
to
be
the
body
of
the
king
mark
well
for
now
thou
shalt
be
condemned
even
by
christ
s
own
words
hoc
est
corpus
then
he
commanded
thomas
cranmer
archbishop
of
canterbury
to
refute
his
assertion
who
first
making
a
short
preface
unto
the
hearers
began
his
disputation
with
lambert
very
modestly
then
again
the
king
and
the
bishops
raged
against
lambert
insomuch
that
he
was
not
only
forced
to
silence
but
also
might
have
been
driven
into
a
rage
if
his
ears
had
not
been
acquainted
with
such
taunts
before
and
here
it
is
much
to
be
marvelled
at
to
see
how
unfortunately
it
came
to
pass
in
this
matter
that
satan
who
oftentimes
doth
raise
up
one
brother
to
the
destruction
of
another
did
here
perform
the
condemnation
of
this
lambert
by
no
other
ministers
than
gospellers
themselves
taylor
barnes
cranmer
and
cromwell
who
afterwards
in
a
manner
all
suffered
the
like
for
the
gospel
s
sake
of
whom
god
willing
we
will
speak
more
hereafter
upon
the
day
that
was
appointed
for
this
holy
martyr
of
god
to
suffer
he
was
brought
out
of
the
prison
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
cromwell
and
so
carried
into
his
inward
chamber
where
it
is
reported
of
many
that
cromwell
desired
of
him
forgiveness
for
what
he
had
done
as
touching
the
terrible
manner
and
fashion
of
the
burning
of
this
blessed
martyr
here
is
to
be
noted
that
of
all
others
who
have
been
burned
and
offered
up
at
smithfield
there
was
yet
none
so
cruelly
and
piteously
handled
as
he
for
after
that
his
legs
were
consumed
and
burned
up
to
the
stumps
and
that
the
wretched
tormentors
and
enemies
of
god
had
withdrawn
the
fire
from
him
so
that
but
a
small
fire
and
coals
were
left
under
him
then
two
that
stood
on
each
side
of
him
with
their
halberts
pitched
him
upon
their
pikes
as
far
as
the
chain
would
reach
then
he
lifting
up
such
hands
as
he
had
and
his
finger
s
ends
flaming
with
fire
cried
unto
the
people
in
these
words
none
but
christ
none
but
christ
and
so
being
let
down
again
from
their
halberts
fell
into
the
fire
and
there
ended
his
in
a
hierarchy
like
the
anglican
whose
function
was
to
preach
passive
obedience
to
the
representative
of
an
opulent
but
somewhat
sluggish
oligarchy
there
could
be
no
permanent
place
for
idealists
with
a
spanish
invasion
threatening
them
an
unwarlike
ruling
class
might
tolerate
sailors
like
drake
or
priests
like
latimer
but
in
the
long
run
their
interest
lay
in
purging
england
of
so
dangerous
an
element
the
aristocracy
sought
men
who
could
be
bought
but
such
were
of
a
different
type
from
latimer
who
when
they
brought
to
him
the
fire
as
he
stood
chained
to
the
stake
spake
in
this
manner
be
of
good
comfort
master
ridley
and
play
the
man
we
shall
this
day
light
such
a
candle
by
god
s
grace
in
england
as
i
trust
shall
never
be
put
and
so
after
he
had
stroked
his
face
with
his
hands
and
as
it
were
bathed
them
a
little
in
the
fire
he
soon
ecclesiastics
like
latimer
were
apt
to
be
of
the
mind
of
knox
who
held
that
sick
as
may
and
do
brydill
the
inordinatt
appetyteis
of
princes
can
not
be
accusit
of
resistance
to
the
aucthoratie
quhilk
is
godis
gud
and
as
the
interests
of
landed
capital
were
bound
up
with
the
maintenance
of
the
royal
prerogative
such
men
had
to
be
eliminated
after
the
death
of
mary
the
danger
apprehended
by
the
landed
gentry
was
a
spanish
invasion
coupled
with
a
catholic
insurrection
and
therefore
the
policy
of
statesmen
like
cecil
was
to
foster
hostility
to
rome
until
after
the
armada
anglicans
were
permitted
to
go
all
lengths
towards
geneva
even
as
late
as
the
lambeth
articles
breathed
pure
calvinism
but
with
the
opening
of
a
new
century
a
change
set
in
as
the
power
of
spain
dwindled
rents
rose
and
the
farmers
grew
restive
at
the
precise
moment
when
men
of
the
heroic
temperament
could
be
discarded
raleigh
was
sent
to
the
tower
in
according
to
thorold
rogers
good
arable
land
which
let
at
less
than
a
shilling
an
acre
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
let
at
to
at
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
seventeenth
while
rent
for
pasture
doubled
rising
rents
and
prices
tending
to
become
stationary
caused
suffering
among
the
rural
population
and
with
suffering
came
discontent
this
discontent
in
the
country
was
fomented
by
restlessness
in
the
towns
for
commerce
had
been
strongly
stimulated
during
the
reign
of
elizabeth
by
the
spanish
wars
and
the
mercantile
element
began
to
rebel
against
legislation
passed
in
the
interest
of
the
favoured
class
suddenly
the
dissatisfaction
found
vent
for
more
than
forty
years
the
queen
s
ministers
had
met
with
no
serious
opposition
in
parliament
in
without
warning
their
system
of
monopolies
was
struck
down
and
from
that
day
to
the
revolution
of
the
house
of
commons
proved
to
be
unmanageable
by
the
crown
even
as
early
as
the
accession
of
james
the
competition
between
the
aristocracy
and
their
victims
had
begun
to
glow
with
the
heat
which
presages
civil
war
had
the
tudor
aristocracy
been
a
martial
caste
they
would
doubtless
have
organized
an
army
and
governed
by
the
sword
but
they
instinctively
felt
that
upon
the
field
of
battle
they
might
be
at
a
disadvantage
and
therefore
they
attempted
to
control
the
popular
imagination
through
the
priesthood
thus
the
divine
right
of
primogeniture
came
to
be
the
distinguishing
tenet
of
the
church
of
england
james
felt
the
full
force
of
the
current
which
was
carrying
him
onward
and
expressed
the
situation
pithily
in
his
famous
apothegm
no
bishop
no
i
will
have
said
he
one
doctrine
one
discipline
one
religion
in
substance
and
ceremony
and
the
policy
of
the
interest
he
represented
was
laid
down
as
early
as
at
the
conference
at
hampton
court
passive
obedience
was
to
be
preached
and
the
church
filled
with
men
who
could
be
relied
on
by
the
oligarchy
six
weeks
after
the
conference
at
hampton
court
whitgift
died
and
bancroft
bishop
of
london
was
translated
to
canterbury
within
a
week
he
was
at
work
he
had
already
prepared
a
book
of
canons
with
which
to
test
the
clergy
and
this
he
had
ratified
by
the
convocation
which
preceded
his
consecration
in
these
canons
the
divine
origin
of
episcopacy
was
asserted
a
strange
departure
from
the
doctrine
of
cranmer
in
there
are
supposed
to
have
been
about
fifteen
hundred
puritan
clergymen
in
england
and
wales
and
at
bancroft
s
first
winnowing
three
hundred
were
ejected
among
these
puritans
was
a
certain
john
robinson
the
teacher
of
a
small
congregation
of
yeomen
in
the
village
of
scrooby
in
nottinghamshire
the
man
s
birth
is
unknown
his
early
history
is
obscure
but
in
him
and
in
the
farmers
who
heard
him
preach
the
long
and
bitter
struggle
against
the
pressure
of
the
class
which
was
destroying
them
had
bred
that
stern
and
sombre
enthusiasm
which
afterward
marked
the
sect
by
england
had
grown
intolerable
to
this
congregation
and
they
resolved
to
emigrate
they
had
heard
that
in
holland
liberty
of
conscience
was
allowed
and
they
fondly
hoped
that
with
liberty
of
conscience
they
might
be
content
to
earn
their
daily
bread
in
peace
probably
with
them
however
religion
was
not
the
cause
but
the
effect
of
their
uneasiness
as
the
result
proved
after
many
trials
and
sorrows
these
poor
people
finally
assembled
in
amsterdam
and
thence
journeyed
to
leyden
where
they
dwelt
some
eleven
years
but
they
found
the
struggle
for
life
to
be
full
as
severe
in
the
low
countries
as
it
had
been
at
home
and
presently
the
exiles
began
to
long
for
some
distant
land
where
they
might
more
glorify
god
do
more
good
to
their
country
better
provide
for
their
posterity
and
live
to
be
more
refreshed
by
their
labours
than
ever
they
could
do
in
accordingly
obtaining
a
grant
from
the
virginia
company
they
sailed
in
the
mayflower
in
to
settle
in
new
england
and
thus
by
the
eviction
of
the
yeomen
england
laid
the
foundation
of
one
great
province
of
her
colonial
empire
chapter
x
spain
and
india
in
the
words
of
froude
before
the
sixteenth
century
had
measured
half
its
course
the
shadow
of
spain
already
stretched
beyond
the
andes
from
the
mines
of
peru
and
the
of
antwerp
the
golden
rivers
streamed
into
her
imperial
treasury
the
crowns
of
aragon
and
castile
of
burgundy
milan
naples
and
sicily
clustered
on
the
brow
of
her
but
with
all
their
great
martial
qualities
the
spaniards
seem
to
have
been
incapable
of
attaining
the
same
velocity
of
movement
as
the
races
with
which
they
had
to
compete
they
never
emerged
from
the
imaginative
period
they
never
developed
the
economic
type
and
in
consequence
they
never
centralized
as
the
english
centralized
even
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
this
peculiarity
had
been
observed
for
the
duke
de
sully
remarked
that
with
spain
the
legs
and
arms
are
strong
and
powerful
but
the
heart
infinitely
weak
and
captain
mahan
has
explained
the
military
impotence
of
the
mighty
mass
which
scattered
over
two
continents
could
not
command
the
sea
and
in
the
seventeenth
century
an
intelligent
dutchman
boasted
that
the
spaniards
have
publicly
begun
to
hire
our
ships
to
sail
to
the
indies
it
is
manifest
that
the
west
indies
being
as
the
stomach
to
spain
for
from
it
nearly
all
the
revenue
is
drawn
must
be
joined
to
the
spanish
head
by
a
sea
force
and
the
glory
of
the
elizabethan
sailors
lay
not
only
in
having
routed
this
sea
force
but
in
having
assimilated
no
small
portion
of
the
nutriment
which
the
american
stomach
should
have
supplied
to
the
spanish
heart
as
spain
lingered
long
in
the
imaginative
age
the
priest
and
soldier
there
reigned
supreme
after
the
mercantile
and
sceptical
type
had
begun
to
predominate
elsewhere
and
the
instinct
of
the
priest
and
soldier
has
always
been
to
exterminate
their
rivals
when
pressed
by
their
competition
in
the
spanish
peninsula
itself
the
inquisition
soon
trampled
out
heresy
but
by
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
low
countries
were
a
hotbed
of
protestantism
and
in
flanders
these
opposing
forces
fought
out
their
battle
to
the
death
the
war
which
ruined
antwerp
made
england
in
antwerp
was
sacked
and
burned
in
the
town
was
reduced
to
starvation
by
the
duke
of
parma
and
its
commerce
having
been
scattered
by
successive
disasters
some
of
it
migrated
to
amsterdam
and
some
sought
shelter
in
the
thames
in
london
the
modern
man
was
protected
by
the
sea
and
the
crisis
of
the
combat
came
in
when
the
spaniards
having
decided
to
pursue
their
enemy
to
his
last
stronghold
sent
the
armada
to
perish
in
the
channel
with
that
supreme
effort
the
vitality
of
the
great
imaginative
empire
began
to
fail
disintegration
set
in
and
on
the
ruins
of
spain
rose
the
purely
economic
centralization
of
great
britain
like
the
venetians
the
british
laid
the
basis
of
their
high
fortune
by
piracy
and
slaving
and
their
advantage
over
spain
lay
not
in
mass
but
in
a
superior
energy
which
gave
them
more
rapid
movement
drake
s
squadron
when
he
sailed
round
the
world
numbered
five
ships
the
largest
measuring
only
one
hundred
and
twenty
tons
the
smallest
twelve
but
with
these
he
succeeded
because
of
their
speed
for
example
he
overtook
the
cacafuego
whose
ballast
was
silver
and
whose
cargo
gold
and
jewels
he
never
disclosed
her
value
but
the
spanish
government
afterward
proved
a
loss
of
a
million
and
a
half
of
ducats
beside
the
property
of
private
individuals
in
like
manner
the
armada
was
destroyed
by
little
ships
which
sailed
round
their
clumsy
enemy
and
disabled
him
before
he
could
strike
a
blow
in
the
spanish
wars
were
halcyon
days
for
the
men
of
martial
blood
who
had
lost
their
land
they
took
to
the
sea
by
thousands
and
ravaged
the
spanish
colonies
with
the
energy
and
ferocity
of
vikings
for
nearly
a
generation
they
wallowed
in
gold
and
silver
and
gems
and
in
the
plunder
of
the
american
towns
among
these
men
sir
francis
drake
stood
foremost
but
after
the
southern
counties
swarmed
with
pirates
and
when
in
drake
sailed
on
his
raid
against
the
west
indies
he
led
a
force
of
volunteers
hundred
strong
he
held
no
commission
the
crews
of
his
ships
served
without
pay
they
went
as
buccaneers
to
fatten
on
the
commerce
of
the
spaniard
as
it
happened
this
particular
expedition
failed
financially
for
the
treasure
fleet
escaped
and
the
plunder
of
the
three
cities
of
santiago
saint
domingo
and
carthagena
yielded
only
but
the
injury
done
to
spain
was
incalculable
no
computation
can
be
attempted
of
the
spoil
taken
during
these
years
no
reports
were
ever
made
on
the
contrary
all
concerned
were
anxious
to
conceal
their
doings
but
certain
prizes
were
too
dazzling
to
be
hidden
when
drake
surprised
three
caravans
on
the
isthmus
numbering
one
hundred
and
ninety
mules
each
mule
loaded
with
three
hundred
pounds
of
silver
the
fact
became
known
no
wonder
drake
ate
off
silver
richly
gilt
and
engraved
with
his
arms
that
he
had
all
possible
luxuries
even
to
perfumes
that
he
dined
and
supped
to
the
music
of
violins
and
that
he
could
bribe
the
queen
with
a
diamond
cross
and
a
coronet
set
with
splendid
emeralds
and
give
the
lord
chancellor
a
service
of
plate
what
he
gave
in
secret
he
alone
knew
as
francis
drake
was
the
ideal
english
corsair
so
john
hawkins
was
the
ideal
slaver
the
men
were
kinsmen
and
of
the
breed
which
when
driven
from
their
farms
at
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
left
their
mark
all
over
the
world
of
course
the
two
sailors
were
gospellers
and
froude
has
quoted
an
interesting
passage
from
the
manuscript
of
a
contemporary
jesuit
which
shows
how
their
class
was
esteemed
toward
the
close
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
only
party
that
would
fight
to
the
death
for
the
queen
the
only
real
friends
she
had
were
the
puritans
the
puritans
of
london
the
puritans
of
the
sea
these
the
priest
thought
desperate
and
determined
men
nevertheless
they
sometimes
provoked
elizabeth
by
their
sermonizing
the
story
is
told
that
one
day
after
reading
a
letter
of
hawkins
to
burleigh
she
cried
god
s
death
this
fool
went
out
a
soldier
and
has
come
back
a
though
both
drake
and
hawkins
possessed
the
predatory
temperament
hawkins
had
a
strong
commercial
instinct
and
kept
closely
to
trade
he
was
the
son
of
old
william
hawkins
the
first
british
captain
who
ever
visited
brazil
and
who
brought
from
thence
a
native
chief
whom
he
presented
to
henry
viii
as
a
young
man
john
had
discovered
at
the
canaries
that
negroes
were
a
very
good
commodity
in
hispaniola
and
that
they
might
easily
be
taken
on
the
coast
of
guinea
accordingly
in
he
fitted
out
three
ships
touched
at
sierra
leone
and
partly
by
the
sword
and
partly
by
other
means
he
obtained
a
cargo
and
with
that
prey
he
sailed
over
the
ocean
sea
to
hispaniola
where
he
sold
his
goods
at
a
large
profit
the
west
india
islands
and
the
countries
bordering
the
gulf
of
mexico
can
not
be
cultivated
profitably
by
white
labourers
therefore
when
the
spaniards
had
by
hard
usage
partially
exterminated
the
natives
a
fresh
supply
of
field
hands
became
necessary
and
these
could
be
had
easily
and
cheaply
on
the
coast
of
africa
at
first
spain
tried
to
exclude
foreigners
from
this
most
lucrative
traffic
but
here
again
the
english
moved
too
quickly
to
be
stopped
wherever
hawkins
went
he
went
prepared
to
fight
and
if
prevented
from
trading
peaceably
he
used
force
in
his
first
voyage
he
met
with
no
opposition
but
subsequently
at
burburata
leave
to
sell
was
denied
him
and
without
an
instant
s
hesitation
he
marched
against
the
town
with
a
hundred
men
well
armed
and
brought
the
governor
to
terms
having
supplied
all
the
slaves
needed
at
that
port
hawkins
went
on
to
rio
de
la
hacha
where
he
in
like
manner
made
a
demonstration
with
one
hundred
men
in
armour
and
two
small
guns
and
in
ten
days
he
had
disposed
of
his
whole
stock
as
at
that
time
an
able
negro
appears
to
have
been
worth
about
in
the
west
indies
a
cargo
of
five
hundred
ought
to
have
netted
between
seventy
and
eighty
thousand
pounds
for
the
cost
of
kidnapping
was
trifling
no
wonder
therefore
that
slaving
flourished
and
that

the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century

probably
carried
not
far
from
one
hundred
thousand
blacks
annually
from
africa
to
the
colonies
the
east
offered
no
such
market
and
doubtless
adam
smith
was
right
in
his
opinion
that
the
commerce
with
india
had
never
been
so
advantageous
as
the
trade
to
america
both
slavers
and
pirates
brought
bullion
to
england
and
presently
this
flow
of
silver
began
to
stimulate
at
london
a
certain
amount
of
exchange
between
the
east
and
west
the
orientals
have
always
preferred
payment
in
specie
and
as
silver
has
usually
offered
more
profit
than
gold
as
an
export
the
european
with
a
surplus
of
silver
has
had
the
advantage
over
all
competitors
accordingly
until
spain
lost
the
power
to
protect
her
communications
with
her
mines
the
spanish
peninsula
enjoyed
almost
a
monopoly
of
the
trade
beyond
the
cape
but
as
the
war
went
on
and
more
of
the
precious
metal
flowed
to
the
north
england
and
holland
began
to
send
their
silver
to
asia
the
dutch
organizing
one
east
india
company
in
and
the
british
another
in
sir
josiah
child
who
was
perhaps
the
ablest
merchant
of
the
seventeenth
century
observed
that
in
the
trade
of
england
then
was
inconsiderable
and
the
merchants
very
mean
and
child
s
facts
are
beyond
doubt
and
the
date
he
fixed
is
interesting
because
it
coincides
with
the
discovery
of
potosi
whence
most
of
the
silver
came
which
supplied
the
pirates
and
the
slavers
prior
to
specie
had
been
scarce
in
london
but
when
the
buccaneers
had
been
scuttling
treasure
galleons
for
a
generation
they
found
themselves
possessed
of
enough
specie
to
set
them
dreaming
of
india
and
thus
piracy
laid
the
foundation
of
the
british
empire
in
asia
but
robbing
the
spaniards
had
another
more
immediate
and
more
startling
result
for
it
probably
precipitated
the
civil
war
as
the
city
grew
rich
it
chafed
at
the
slow
movement
of
the
aristocracy
who
timid
and
peaceful
cramped
it
by
closing
the
channels
through
which
it
reached
the
property
of
foreigners
and
just
when
the
yeomanry
were
exasperated
by
rising
rents
london
began
to
glow
with
that
energy
which
when
given
vent
was
destined
to
subdue
so
large
a
portion
of
the
world
perhaps
it
is
not
going
too
far
to
say
that
even
from
the
organization
of
the
east
india
company
the
mercantile
interest
controlled
england
not
that
it
could
then
rule
alone
it
lacked
the
power
to
do
so
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
to
come
but
after
its
weight
turned
the
scale
on
which
side
soever
thrown
before
the
long
parliament
the
merchants
were
generally
presbyterians
or
moderate
puritans
the
farmers
independents
or
radicals
and
winthrop
when
preparing
for
the
emigration
to
massachusetts
dealt
not
only
with
squires
like
hampden
but
with
city
magnates
like
thomas
andrews
the
lord
mayor
this
alliance
between
the
rural
and
the
urban
puritans
carried
through
the
great
rebellion
and
as
their
coalition
crushed
the
monarchy
so
their
separation
reinstated
it
macaulay
has
very
aptly
observed
that
but
for
the
hostility
of
the
city
charles
the
first
would
never
have
been
vanquished
and
that
without
the
help
of
the
city
charles
the
second
could
scarcely
have
been
at
the
protector
s
death
the
presbyterians
abandoned
the
farmers
probably
because
they
feared
them
the
army
of
the
commonwealth
swarmed
with
men
like
cromwell
and
blake
warriors
resistless
alike
on
land
and
sea
with
whom
when
organized
the
city
could
not
cope
therefore
it
scattered
them
and
throwing
in
its
lot
with
the
cavaliers
set
up
the
king
for
about
a
generation
after
the
restoration
no
single
interest
had
the
force
to
impose
its
will
upon
the
nation
or
in
other
words
parties
were
equally
balanced
but
from
the
middle
of
the
century
the
tide
flowed
rapidly
capital
accumulated
and
as
it
accumulated
the
men
adapted
to
be
its
instruments
grew
to
be
the
governing
class
sir
josiah
child
is
the
most
interesting
figure
of
this
period
his
acquaintance
remembered
him
a
poor
apprentice
sweeping
the
where
he
worked
and
yet
at
fifty
his
fortune
reached
a
year
a
sum
almost
equal
to
the
of
the
duke
of
ormond
the
richest
peer
of
the
realm
child
married
his
daughter
to
the
eldest
son
of
the
duke
of
beaufort
and
gave
her
and
his
ability
was
so
commanding
that
for
years
he
absolutely
ruled
the
east
india
company
and
used
its
revenues
to
corrupt
parliament
on
matters
of
finance
such
a
man
would
hardly
err
and
he
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
in
there
were
more
merchants
to
be
found
upon
the
exchange
worth
each
one
thousand
pounds
and
upwards
than
were
in
the
former
days
before
the
year
to
be
found
worth
one
hundred
pounds
and
now
there
are
more
men
to
be
found
upon
the
exchange
now
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
estates
than
were
then
of
one
thousand
pounds
and
if
this
be
doubted
let
us
ask
the
aged
whether
five
hundred
pounds
portion
with
a
daughter
sixty
years
ago
were
not
esteemed
a
larger
portion
than
two
thousand
pounds
is
now
and
whether
gentlewomen
in
those
days
would
not
esteem
themselves
well
clothed
in
a
serge
gown
which
a
chambermaid
now
will
be
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
we
have
now
almost
one
hundred
coaches
for
one
we
had
formerly
we
with
ease
can
pay
a
greater
tax
now
in
one
year
than
our
forefathers
could
in
twenty
our
customs
are
very
much
improved
i
believe
above
the
proportion
aforesaid
of
six
to
one
which
is
not
so
much
in
advance
of
the
rates
of
goods
as
by
increase
of
the
bulk
of
trade
i
can
myself
remember
since
there
were
not
in
london
used
so
many
wharves
or
keys
for
the
landing
of
merchants
goods
by
at
least
one
third
part
as
now
there
are
and
those
that
were
then
could
scarce
have
employment
for
half
what
they
could
do
and
now
notwithstanding
more
used
to
the
same
purpose
they
are
all
too
little
in
time
of
peace
to
land
the
goods
at
that
come
to
child
estimated
that
within
twenty
years
wages
had
risen
and
rents
per
cent
while
houses
in
london
yield
twice
the
rent
they
did
before
the
farms
that
their
grandfathers
or
fathers
bought
or
sold
fifty
years
past
would
yield
one
with
another
at
least
treble
the
money
and
in
some
cases
six
times
the
money
they
were
then
bought
and
sold
macaulay
has
estimated
the
population
of
london
in
at
half
a
million
and
believed
it
to
have
then
become
the
largest
city
in
europe
the
aristocracy
were
forced
to
tolerate
men
of
the
predatory
type
while
they
feared
a
spanish
invasion
but
after
the
defeat
of
the
armada
these
warriors
became
dangerous
at
home
and
the
oligarchy
very
naturally
tried
to
purge
the
island
of
a
class
which
constantly
menaced
their
authority
persecution
drove
numbers
of
nonconformists
to
america
and
the
story
of
captain
john
smith
shows
how
hardly
society
then
pressed
on
the
race
of
adventurers
even
where
the
bitterness
of
the
struggle
did
not
produce
religious
enthusiasm
smith
lived
a
generation
too
late
born
in
he
was
a
child
of
nine
when
the
armada
perished
and
only
sixteen
when
drake
and
hawkins
died
at
sea
smith
s
father
had
property
but
when
left
an
orphan
his
guardians
neglected
him
and
at
fifteen
let
him
set
out
on
his
travels
with
only
ten
shillings
in
his
pocket
at
home
no
career
was
open
to
him
for
the
cecils
rather
inclined
to
imprison
and
behead
soldiers
of
fortune
than
to
reward
them
accordingly
he
went
abroad
and
by
had
seen
service
in
most
countries
of
the
continent
had
been
enslaved
by
the
turks
had
escaped
and
wandered
to
barbary
had
fought
the
spanish
on
a
french
and
at
last
had
learned
that
the
dreams
of
his
youth
belonged
to
a
past
age
and
that
he
must
enter
a
new
path
he
therefore
joined
himself
to
a
party
bound
for
virginia
and
the
hardship
of
the
times
may
be
gauged
by
the
fact
that
out
of
a
company
of
a
hundred
were
gentlemen
adventurers
as
needy
as
himself
none
of
whom
sought
exile
for
religion
smith
s
voyages
to
america
brought
him
nothing
but
bitterness
he
returned
to
england
and
passed
his
last
years
in
obscurity
and
neglect
and
perhaps
the
fate
that
awaited
soldiers
under
james
has
been
nowhere
better
told
than
in
smith
s
own
words
he
spent
five
years
and
more
than
five
hundred
pounds
in
the
service
of
virginia
and
new
england
yet
in
neither
have
i
one
foot
of
land
nor
the
very
house
i
builded
nor
the
ground
i
digged
with
my
own
hands
nor
ever
any
content
or
satisfaction
at
all
and
though
i
see
ordinarily
those
two
countries
shared
before
me
by
them
that
neither
have
them
nor
know
them
but
by
my
as
long
as
the
tudor
aristocracy
ruled
great
britain
afforded
small
comfort
for
men
like
smith
that
aristocracy
had
genius
neither
for
adventure
nor
for
war
and
few
western
nations
have
a
sorrier
military
history
than
england
under
the
stuarts
yet
beneath
the
inert
mass
of
the
nobility
seethed
an
energy
which
was
to
recentralize
the
world
and
when
capital
had
accumulated
to
a
certain
point
the
men
who
gave
it
an
outlet
laid
their
grasp
upon
the
state
in
the
commercial
adventurers
conquered
the
kingdom
the
change
was
radical
at
once
social
political
and
religious
the
stronghold
of
the
tories
had
been
the
royal
prerogative
the
victors
lodged
the
power
of
the
crown
in
a
committee
chosen
by
the
house
of
commons
the
dogma
of
divine
right
immediately
vanished
and
with
it
all
that
distinguished
anglicanism
though
perverted
by
the
tudors
this
great
tenet
of
the
church
of
henry
viii
had
been
at
least
a
survival
of
an
imaginative
age
and
when
the
merchants
swept
it
away
all
trace
of
idealism
departed
thenceforward
english
civilization
became
a
purely
materialistic
phenomenon
in
proportion
as
movement
accelerates
societies
consolidate
and
as
societies
consolidate
they
pass
through
a
profound
intellectual
change
energy
ceases
to
find
vent
through
the
imagination
and
takes
the
form
of
capital
hence
as
civilizations
advance
the
imaginative
temperament
tends
to
disappear
while
the
economic
instinct
is
fostered
and
thus
substantially
new
varieties
of
men
come
to
possess
the
world
nothing
so
portentous
overhangs
humanity
as
this
mysterious
and
relentless
acceleration
of
movement
which
changes
methods
of
competition
and
alters
paths
of
trade
for
by
it
countless
millions
of
men
and
women
are
foredoomed
to
happiness
or
misery
as
certainly
as
the
beasts
and
trees
which
have
flourished
in
the
wilderness
are
destined
to
vanish
when
the
soil
is
subdued
by
man
the
romans
amassed
the
treasure
by
which
they
administered
their
empire
through
the
plunder
and
enslavement
of
the
world
the
empire
cemented
by
that
treasure
crumbled
when
adverse
exchanges
carried
the
bullion
of
italy
to
the
shore
of
the
bosphorus
an
accelerated
movement
among
the
of
the
west
caused
the
agony
of
the
crusades
amidst
which
constantinople
fell
as
the
italian
cities
rose
while
venice
and
genoa
and
with
them
the
whole
arabic
civilization
shrivelled
when
portugal
established
direct
communication
with
hindostan
the
opening
of
the
ocean
as
a
highroad
precipitated
the
reformation
and
built
up
antwerp
while
in
the
end
it
ruined
spain
and
finally
the
last
great
quickening
of
the
age
of
steam
which
centralized
the
world
at
london
bathed
the
earth
in
blood
from
the
mississippi
to
the
ganges
thus
religions
are
preached
and
are
forgotten
empires
rise
and
fall
philosophies
are
born
and
die
art
and
poetry
bloom
and
fade
as
societies
pass
from
the
disintegration
wherein
the
imagination
kindles
to
the
consolidation
whose
pressure
ends
in
death
in
when
the
momentum
of
england
suddenly
increased
the
change
was
equivalent
to
the
conquest
of
the
island
by
a
new
race
among
the
family
of
european
nations
great
britain
rose
as
no
people
had
risen
since
the
punic
wars
almost
instantly
she
entered
on
a
career
of
conquest
unparalleled
in
modern
history
of
the
hundred
and
years
between
the
boyne
and
waterloo
she
passed
some
seventy
in
waging
ferocious
wars
from
which
she
emerged
victorious
on
land
and
sea
the
mistress
of
a
mighty
empire
the
owner
of
incalculable
wealth
and
the
centre
of
the
world
s
exchanges
then
from
this
culminating
point
of
expansion
by
conquest
she
glided
subtly
and
almost
imperceptibly
into
the
period
of
contraction
as
rome
went
before
her
under
the
cæsars
although
abundant
metallic
currency
does
not
probably
of
itself
create
mercantile
prosperity
such
prosperity
is
hardly
compatible
with
a
shrinking
stock
of
money
for
when
contraction
sets
in
and
prices
fall
producers
and
debtors
are
ruined
as
they
were
ruined
in
italy
under
the
later
emperors
toward
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
europe
appeared
to
be
on
the
brink
of
such
a
contraction
for
though
peru
had
lavishly
replenished
the
supply
of
the
precious
metals
a
hundred
years
previously
the
drain
to
asia
and
the
increasing
demands
of
commerce
had
been
so
considerable
that
the
standard
coin
had
generally
depreciated
from
the
reign
of
augustus
downward
commerce
between
europe
and
asia
has
usually
favoured
asia
and
this
was
particularly
true
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
the
value
of
bullion
fell
in
the
west
and
therefore
encouraged
lavish
exports
to
the
east
where
it
retained
its
purchasing
power
according
to
adam
smith
the
banks
of
venice
genoa
amsterdam
hamburg
and
nuremberg
seem
to
have
been
all
originally
established
to
provide
an
ideal
currency
for
the
settlement
of
bills
of
exchange
and
the
money
of
such
banks
being
better
than
the
common
currency
of
the
country
necessarily
bore
an
agio
which
was
greater
or
smaller
according
as
the
currency
was
supposed
to
be
more
or
less
degraded
below
the
standard
of
the
smith
estimated
the
depreciation
at
hamburg
at
fourteen
per
cent
and
at
amsterdam
early
in
the
previous
century
at
nine
per
cent
in
short
all
european
countries
suffered
but
in
england
the
evil
reached
a
climax
through
the
inertia
of
the
new
aristocracy
in
england
silver
had
always
been
the
standard
and
by
the
third
year
of
elizabeth
the
coin
had
been
restored
to
its
proper
fineness
which
thenceforward
was
scrupulously
maintained
but
though
the
metal
was
not
degraded
by
the
government
the
stock
of
bullion
if
not
constantly
replenished
from
without
tended
to
diminish
in
proportion
to
the
growth
of
the
country
and
the
export
of
specie
to
asia
after
the
discovery
of
america
the
value
of
silver
in
relation
to
gold
fell
in
europe
to
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
to
one
while
in
china
or
india
it
stood
pretty
steady
at
from
ten
to
twelve
to
one
consequently
from
downward
silver
remained
the
most
profitable
cargo
which
could
be
sent
round
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
unhappily
for
british
prosperity
at
the
very
moment
when
the
east
india
company
came
into
being
piracy
ceased
the
chief
supply
of
bullion
being
thus
cut
off
the
strain
of
the
export
trade
fell
upon
the
coin
and
within
a
little
more
than
a
generation
the
effect
become
apparent
in
a
degeneration
of
the
currency
to
make
good
her
position
as
a
centre
of
exchanges
england
had
no
choice
but
to
supply
her
necessities
by
force
cromwell
understood
the
situation
perfectly
and
had
hardly
assumed
the
office
of
protector
when
he
laid
plans
to
cut
the
evil
at
the
root
by
conquering
spanish
america
and
robbing
spain
of
her
mines
to
this
end
he
fitted
out
his
great
expedition
against
saint
domingo
which
was
to
serve
him
as
his
base
but
for
once
his
military
genius
failed
him
his
commanders
blundered
the
attack
miscarried
and
the
island
of
jamaica
was
all
that
came
of
the
campaign
meanwhile
however
that
no
time
might
be
lost
while
fighting
for
the
mines
themselves
cromwell
sent
blake
to
intercept
the
treasure
ships
off
the
coast
of
spain
at
first
blake
also
had
in
the
plate
fleet
escaped
him
but
the
next
year
though
forced
himself
to
go
to
port
for
supplies
he
detached
captain
stayner
with
six
sail
to
cruise
off

and
on
september
general
montague
was
able
to
report
that
his
hart
was
very
much
warmed
with
the
apprehension
of
the
singular
providence
of
god
who
had
permitted
stayner
to
meet
with
the
kinge
of
spain
s
west
india
fleete
and
take
among
other
prizes

gallion
reported
to
have
in
her
two
million
pieces
of
if
the
plate
were
mexican
pieces
of
eight
at
four
shillings
and
sixpence
the
cargo
was
worth
or
considerably
more
than
the
whole
annual
export
to
the
east
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
the
protector
lived
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
by
some
such
means
as
this
he
would
have
fostered
british
resources
and
maintained
the
integrity
of
british
coin
but
in
less
than
two
years
from
the
date
of
montague
s
dispatch
cromwell
was
dead
and
the
inertia
of
the
tory
landlords
paralyzed
the
nation
for
another
generation
no
foreigner
was
robbed
and
the
stock
of
domestic
silver
dwindled
from
year
to
year
until
at
the
revolution
the
golden
guinea
which
from
its
first
issue
in
down
to
the
accession
of
william
and
mary
had
been
nominally
current
for
twenty
shillings
actually
sold
in
the
market
for
thirty
shillings
of
the
money
in
use
this
diminishing
and
counterfeiting
the
money
was
at
this
time
so
excessive
that
what
was
good
silver
was
worth
scarcely
of
its
current
value
whilst
a
great
part
of
the
coins
was
only
iron
brass
or
copper
plated
and
some
no
more
than
washed
one
of
the
first
acts
of
the
new
government
was
a
complete
recoinage
which
was
finished
in
but
the
measure
failed
of
its
purpose
for
the
reason
that
the
exports
of
silver
regularly
exceeded
the
imports
in
a
committee
of
the
house
of
lords
considered
the
condition
of
the
currency
and
lord
stanhope
then
explained
very
lucidly
the
cause
of
the
scarcity
of
silver
among
other
papers
he
produced
a
report
from
the
custom
house
by
which
it
appeared
that
in
the
year
the
east
india
company
had
exported
near
three
million
ounces
of
silver
which
far
exceeding
the
imports
of
the
bullion
in
that
year
it
necessarily
followed
that
vast
quantities
of
silver
specie
must
have
been
melted
down
both
to
make
up
the
export
and
to
supply
the
for
the
decade
from
to
the
annual
export
of
bullion
by
the
east
india
company

at
the
accession
of
george
in
lord
liverpool
estimated
that
shillings
had
lost
and
sixpences
of
their
original
weight
while
the
had
almost
wholly
disappeared
even
adam
smith
admitted
that
because
of
this
outflow
silver
had
risen
in
value
and
probably
purchased
a
larger
quantity
both
of
labour
and
commodities
than
it
otherwise
would
in
this
emergency
the
british
merchants
showed
the
resource
which
has
always
been
their
characteristic
and
in
default
of
an
adequate
supply
of
specie
relieved
the
strain
upon
their
currency
by
issuing
paper
mediæval
banking
had
gone
no
further
than
the
establishment
of
reserves
of
coin
to
serve
as
a
medium
for
clearing
bills
of
exchange
the
english
took
the
great
step
of
accelerating
the
circulation
of
their
money
by
using
this
reserve
as
a
basis
for
a
paper
currency
which
might
be
largely
expanded
the
bank
of
england
was
incorporated
in
the
bank
of
scotland
in
and
the
effect
was
unquestionably
considerable
adam
smith
has
thus
described
the
impetus
received
by
glasgow
the
effects
of
it
have
been
precisely
those
above
described
the
business
of
the
country
is
almost
entirely
carried
on
by
means
of
the
paper
of
those
different
banking
companies
with
which
purchases
and
payments
of
all
kinds
are
commonly
made
silver
very
seldom
appears
except
in
the
change
of
a
twenty
shillings
bank
note
and
gold
still
seldomer
but
though
the
conduct
of
all
those
different
companies
has
not
been
unexceptionable
the
country
notwithstanding
has
evidently
derived
great
benefit
from
their
trade
i
have
heard
it
asserted
that
the
trade
of
the
city
of
glasgow
doubled
in
about
fifteen
years
after
the
first
erection
of
the
banks
there
and
that
the
trade
of
scotland
has
more
than
quadrupled
since
the
first
erection
of
the
two
public
banks
at
but
although
by
this
means
a
certain
degree
of
relief
was
given
and
though
prices
rose
slowly
throughout
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
fundamental
difficulty
remained
there
was
insufficient
silver
for
export
exchanges
were
adverse
and
that
stock
of
coined
money
was
lacking
which
is
the
form
in
which
force
clothes
itself
in
highly
centralized
communities
how
england
finally
supplied
her
needs
is
one
of
the
most
dramatic
pages
of
history
as
jevons
has
aptly
observed
asia
is
the
great
reservoir
and
sink
of
the
precious
from
time
immemorial
the
oriental
custom
has
been
to
hoard
and
from
the
mogul
blazing
with
the
diamonds
of
golconda
to
the
peasant
starving
on
his
wretched
pittance
every
hindoo
had
in
former
days
a
treasure
stored
away
against
a
day
of
trouble
year
by
year
since
pizarro
had
murdered
the
inca
atahualpa
for
his
gold
a
stream
of
bullion
had
flowed
from
america
to
europe
and
from
europe
to
the
east
there
it
had
vanished
as
completely
as
though
once
more
buried
in
the
bowels
of
the
mine
these
hoards
the
savings
of
millions
of
human
beings
for
centuries
the
english
seized
and
took
to
london
as
the
romans
had
taken
the
spoil
of
greece
and
pontus
to
italy
what
the
value
of
the
treasure
was
no
man
can
estimate
but
it
must
have
been
many
millions
of
pounds
a
vast
sum
in
proportion
to
the
stock
of
the
precious
metals
then
owned
by
europeans
some
faint
idea
of
the
booty
of
the
conqueror
may
be
drawn
from
macaulay
s
description
of
the
first
visit
of
an
english
soldier
to
an
oriental
treasure
chamber
as
to
clive
there
was
no
limit
to
his
acquisitions
but
his
own
moderation
the
treasury
of
bengal
was
thrown
open
to
him
there
were
piled
up
after
the
usage
of
indian
princes
immense
masses
of
coin
among
which
might
not
seldom
be
detected
the
florins
and
byzants
with
which
before
any
european
ship
had
turned
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
venetians
purchased
the
stuffs
and
spices
of
the
east
clive
walked
between
heaps
of
gold
and
silver
crowned
with
rubies
and
diamonds
and
was
at
liberty
to
help
the
lives
of
few
men
are
better
known
than
those
of
clive
and
hastings
and
yet
there
are
few
whose
influence
upon
the
fate
of
mankind
has
had
such
scant
appreciation
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
destiny
of
europe
hinged
upon
the
conquest
of
bengal
robert
clive
was
of
the
same
stock
as
drake
and
hawkins
raleigh
blake
and
cromwell
he
was
the
eldest
son
of
one
of
those
small
farmers
whose
ancestors
had
held
their
land
ever
since
the
conquest
and
who
when
at
last
evicted
and
driven
out
to
sea
had
fought
and
conquered
on
every
continent
and
on
every
ocean
among
the
throng
of
great
english
adventurers
none
is
greater
than
he
he
was
born
in
and
from
childhood
displayed
those
qualities
which
made
him
on
the
field
of
battle
fighting
was
his
delight
and
so
fierce
was
his
temper
that
his
family
could
not
control
him
at
last
when
eighteen
his
father
gladly
sent
him
to
madras
as
a
clerk
in
the
service
of
the
east
india
company
and
there
in
a
torrid
climate
which
shattered
his
health
poor
and
neglected
lonely
and
forlorn
he
pined
until
in
melancholy
he
twice
attempted
suicide
but
he
was
destined
to
found
an
empire
and
at
last
his
hour
came
when
clive
went
to
india
the
company
was
still
a
purely
commercial
concern
holding
only
the
land
needed
for
its
warehouses
and
having
in
their
pay
a
few
sepoys
in
the
year
when
clive
was
the
war
of
the
austrian
succession
was
raging
and
suddenly
a
french
fleet
commanded
by
labourdonnais
appeared
off
madras
and
attacked
fort
saint
george
resistance
was
hopeless
the
place
surrendered
and
the
governor
and
chief
inhabitants
were
taken
to
pondicherry
clive
however
managed
to
escape
and
volunteering
received
an
ensign
s
commission
and
began
his
military
career
shortly
after
peace
was
made
in
europe
but
in
india
the
issue
of
the
struggle
lay
undecided
between
the
french
and
english
the
prize
being
the
peninsula
dupleix
the
french
governor
of
pondicherry
was
a
man
of
commanding
intellect
who
first
saw
the
possibility
of
constructing
a
european
empire
in
hindostan
by
controlling
native
princes
following
up
his
idea
he
mixed
in
a
war
of
succession
and
having
succeeded
in
establishing
a
sovereign
of
the
deccan
he
made
himself
master
of
southern
india
the
nizam
s
treasure
was
thrown
open
to
him
and
beside
many
jewels
of
price
he
is
said
to
have
appropriated
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
coin
this
was
the
man
whom
clive
when
only
a
clerk
of
without
military
education
or
experience
attacked
and
overthrew
clive
began
his
campaigns
by
the
capture
and
defence
of
arcot
one
of
the
most
daring
deeds
of
a
generation
given
over
to
perpetual
war
aided
by
their
native
allies
the
french
had
laid
siege
to
trichinopoly
and
clive
represented
to
his
superiors
that
with
the
fate
of
trichinopoly
was
bound
up
the
fate
of
the
whole
peninsula
he
recommended
making
a
diversion
by
assaulting
arcot
the
capital
of
the
carnatic
his
plan
met
with
approval
and
with
two
hundred
europeans
and
three
hundred
sepoys
he
marched
to
fight
the
greatest
power
in
the
east
he
succeeded
in
surprising
and
occupying
the
town
without
loss
but
when
within
the
city
his
real
peril
began
arcot
had
neither
ditches
nor
defensible
ramparts
the
english
were
short
of
provisions
and
the
nabob
hurried
forward
ten
thousand
men
to
relieve
his
capital
with
four
officers
one
hundred
and
twenty
british
and
two
hundred
sepoys
clive
held
the
town
for
fifty
days
and
when
the
enemy
assaulted
for
the
last
time
he
served
his
own
guns
he
won
a
decisive
victory
and
from
that
hour
was
recognized
as
among
the
most
brilliant
officers
of
the
world
other
campaigns
followed
but
his
health
undermined
by
the
tropics
gave
way
and
at
he
returned
home
to
squander
his
money
and
contest
an
election
to
parliament
he
soon
reached
the
end
of
his
resources
and
just
before
the
opening
of
the
seven
years
war
he
accepted
a
s
commission
and
set
sail
to
take
command
in
hindostan
the
company
appointed
him
governor
of
fort
saint
david
a
settlement
near
madras
but
he
had
hardly
assumed
his
office
before
an
event
occurred
which
caused
the
conquest
of
bengal
the
nabob
of
bengal
captured
calcutta
and
imprisoned
one
hundred
and
of
the
english
residents
in
the
black
hole
where
in
a
single
night
one
hundred
and
perished
clive
was
summoned
and
acted
with
his
usual
vigour
he
routed
the
nabob
s
army
recovered
calcutta
and
would
have
taken
vengeance
at
once
had
not
the
civilians
who
wanted
to
be
restored
to
their
places
interfered
long
and
tortuous
negotiations
followed
in
which
clive
displayed
more
than
oriental
cunning
and
duplicity
ending
in
a
march
into
the
interior
and
the
battle
of
plassey
there
with
one
thousand
english
and
two
thousand
sepoys
he
met
and
crushed
the
army
of
the
nabob
sixty
thousand
strong
on
june
one
of
the
richest
provinces
of
asia
lay
before
him
defenceless
ripe
for
plunder
eight
hundred
thousand
pounds
were
sent
down
the
hooghly
to
calcutta
in
one
shipment
clive
himself
took
between
two
and
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
like
drake
and
hawkins
clive
had
done
great
things
for
england
but
he
was
a
military
adventurer
one
of
the
class
in
whom
the
aristocracy
recognized
an
enemy
and
though
in
london
he
was
treated
with
outward
respect
and
even
given
an
irish
peerage
the
landed
interest
hated
him
and
tried
to
destroy
him
as
in
the
next
generation
it
tried
to
destroy
hastings
upon
the
plundering
of
india
there
can
be
no
better
authority
than
macaulay
who
held
high
office
at
calcutta
when
the
administration
of
hastings
was
still
remembered
and
who
less
than
any
of
the
writers
who
have
followed
him
was
a
of
the
official
class
he
has
told
how
after
plassey
the
shower
of
wealth
began
to
fall
and
he
has
described
clive
s
own
gains
we
may
safely
affirm
that
no
englishman
who
started
with
nothing
has
ever
in
any
line
of
life
created
such
a
fortune
at
the
early
age
of
but
the
takings
of
clive
either
for
himself
or
for
the
government
were
trifling
compared
to
the
wholesale
robbery
and
spoliation
which
followed
his
departure
when
bengal
was
surrendered
a
helpless
prey
to
a
myriad
of
greedy
officials
these
officials
were
absolute
irresponsible
and
rapacious
and
they
emptied
the
private
hoards
their
only
thought
was
to
wring
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
out
of
the
natives
as
quickly
as
possible
and
hurry
home
to
display
their
wealth
enormous
fortunes
were
thus
rapidly
accumulated
at
calcutta
while
thirty
millions
of
human
beings
were
reduced
to
the
extremity
of
the
misgovernment
of
the
english
was
carried
to
a
point
such
as
seems
hardly
compatible
with
the
very
existence
of
society
the
roman
proconsul
who
in
a
year
or
two
squeezed
out
of
a
province
the
means
of
rearing
marble
palaces
and
baths
on
the
shores
of
campania
of
drinking
from
amber
of
feasting
on
singing
birds
of
exhibiting
armies
of
gladiators
and
flocks
of
camelopards
the
spanish
viceroy
who
leaving
behind
him
the
curses
of
mexico
or
lima
entered
madrid
with
a
long
train
of
gilded
coaches
and
of
trapped
and
shod
with
silver
were
now
thus
treasure
in
oceans
flowed
into
england
through
private
hands
but
in
india
the
affairs
of
the
company
went
from
bad
to
worse
misgovernment
impoverished
the
people
the
savings
of
long
years
of
toil
were
exhausted
and
when
in
a
drought
brought
famine
the
resources
of
the
people
failed
and
they
perished
by
millions
the
very
streets
of
calcutta
were
blocked
up
by
the
dying
and
the
then
came
an
outbreak
of
wrath
from
disappointed
stockholders
the
landed
interest
seized
its
opportunity
to
attack
clive
in
parliament
and
the
merchants
chose
hastings
to
develop
the
resources
of
hindostan
as
sheridan
said
the
company
extended
the
sordid
principles
of
their
origin
over
all
their
successive
operations
connecting
with
their
civil
policy
and
even
with
their
boldest
achievements
the
meanness
of
a
pedlar
and
the
profligacy
of
in
hastings
the
company
found
a
man
fitted
to
their
hands
a
statesman
worthy
to
organize
a
vast
empire
on
an
economic
basis
able
bold
cool
and
relentless
he
grasped
the
situation
at
a
glance
and
never
faltered
in
his
purpose
if
more
treasure
was
to
be
wrung
from
the
natives
force
had
to
be
used
systematically
though
bengal
might
be
ruined
the
hoards
of
the
neighbouring
potentates
remained
safe
and
these
hastings
deliberately
set
himself
to
drain
macaulay
has
explained
the
policy
and
the
motives
which
actuated
him
the
object
of
his
diplomacy
was
at
this
time
simply
to
get
money
the
finances
of
his
government
were
in
an
embarrassed
state
and
this
embarrassment
he
was
determined
to
relieve
by
some
means
fair
or
foul
the
principle
which
directed
all
his
dealings
with
his
neighbours
is
fully
expressed
by
the
old
motto
of
one
of
the
great
predatory
families
of
teviotdale
thou
shalt
want
ere
i
he
seems
to
have
laid
it
down
as
a
fundamental
proposition
which
could
not
be
disputed
that
when
he
had
not
as
many
lacs
of
rupees
as
the
public
service
required
he
was
to
take
them
from
anybody
who
had
one
thing
indeed
is
to
be
said
in
excuse
for
him
the
pressure
applied
to
him
by
his
employers
at
home
was
such
as
only
the
highest
virtue
could
have
withstood
such
as
left
him
no
choice
except
to
commit
great
wrongs
or
to
resign
his
high
post
and
with
that
post
all
his
hopes
of
fortune
and
how

he
spilt
is
known
as
few
passages
of
history
are
known
for
the
story
has
been
told
by
macaulay
and
by
burke
how
he
robbed
the
nabob
of
bengal
of
half
the
income
the
company
had
solemnly
promised
to

how

repudiated
the
revenue
which
the
government
had
covenanted
to
yield
to
the
mogul
as
a
tribute
for
provinces
ceded
them
and
how
in
consideration
of
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
he
sent
a
brigade
to
slaughter
the
rohillas
and
placidly
saw
their
villages
burned
their
children
butchered
and
their
women
violated
has
been
described
in
one
of
the
most
popular
essays
in
the
language
at
hastings
impeachment
the
heaviest
charge
against
him
was
that
based
on
his
conduct
toward
the
princesses
of
oude
whom
his
creature
imprisoned
and
starved
whose
servants
he
tormented
and
from
whom
he
wrung
at

twelve
hundred
thousand
pounds

the
price

these
acts
and
acts
such
as
these
the

defined
capital
as
the
accumulated
stock
of
human
in
other
words
capital
may
be
considered
as
stored
energy
but
most
of
this
energy
flows
in
fixed
channels
money
alone
is
capable
of
being
transmuted
immediately
into
any
form
of
activity
therefore
the
influx
of
the
indian
treasure
by
adding
considerably
to
the
nation
s
cash
capital
not
only
increased
its
stock
of
energy
but
added
much
to
its
flexibility
and
the
rapidity
of
its
movement
very
soon
after
plassey
the
bengal
plunder
began
to
arrive
in
london
and
the
effect
appears
to
have
been
instantaneous
for
all
authorities
agree
that
the
industrial
revolution
the
event
which
has
divided
the
nineteenth
century
from
all
antecedent
time
began
with
the
year
prior
to
according
to
baines
the
machinery
used
for
spinning
cotton
in
lancashire
was
almost
as
simple
as
in
india
while
about
the
english
iron
industry
was
in
full
decline
because
of
the
destruction
of
the
forests
for
fuel
at
that
time
of
the
iron
in
use
in
the
kingdom
came
from
sweden
plassey
was
fought
in
and
probably
nothing
has
ever
equalled
the
rapidity
of
the
change
which
followed
in
the
appeared
and
coal
began
to
replace
wood
in

perfect

hut
though
these
machines
served
as
outlets
for
the
accelerating
movement
of
the
time
they
did
not
cause
that
acceleration
in
themselves
inventions
are
passive
many
of
the
most
important
having
lain
dormant
for
centuries
waiting
for
a
sufficient
store
of
force
to
have
accumulated
to
set
them
working
that
store
must
always
take
the
shape
of
money
and
money
not
hoarded
but
in
motion
thus
printing
had
been
known
for
ages
in
china
before
it
came
to
europe
the
romans
probably
were
acquainted
with
gunpowder
revolvers
and
cannon
existed
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
and
steam
had
been
experimented
upon
long
before
the
birth
of
watt
the
least
part
of
watt
s
labour
lay
in
conceiving
his
idea
he
consumed
his
life
in
marketing
it
before
the
influx
of
the
indian
treasure
and
the
expansion
of
credit
which
followed
no
force
sufficient
for
this
purpose
existed
and
had
watt
lived
fifty
years
earlier
he
and
his
invention
must
have
perished
together
considering
the
difficulties
under
which
matthew
boulton
the
ablest
and
most
energetic
manufacturer
of
his
time
nearly
succumbed
no
one
can
doubt
that
without
boulton
s
works
at
birmingham
the
engine
could
not
have
been
produced
and
yet
before
such
works
could
not
have
been
organized
the
factory
system
was
the
child
of
the
industrial
revolution
and
until
capital
had
accumulated
in
masses
capable
of
giving
solidity
to
large
bodies
of
labour
manufactures
were
necessarily
carried
on
by
scattered
individuals
who
combined
a
handicraft
with
agriculture
defoe
s
charming
description
of
halifax
about
the
time
boulton
learned
his
trade
is
well
known
the
nearer
we
came
to
halifax
we
found
the
houses
thicker
and
the
villages
greater
in
every
bottom
for
the
land
being
divided
into
small
enclosures
from
two
acres
to
six
or
seven
each
seldom
more
every
three
or
four
pieces
of
land
had
an
house
belonging
to
them
in
short
after
we
had
mounted
the
third
hill
we
found
the
country
one
continued
village
tho
every
way
mountainous
hardly
an
house
standing
out
of
a
speaking
distance
from
another
and
as
the
day
cleared
up
we
could
see
at
every
house
a
tenter
and
on
almost
every
tenter
a
piece
of
cloth
kersie
or
shalloon
which
are
the
three
articles
of
this
countries
labour
this
place
then
seems
to
have
been
designed
by
providence
for
the
very
purposes
to
which
it
is
now
allotted
nor
is
the
industry
of
the
people
wanting
to
second
these
advantages
tho
we
met
few
people
without
doors
yet
within
we
saw
the
houses
full
of
lusty
fellows
some
at
the
dye
vat
some
at
the
loom
others
dressing
the
cloths
the
women
and
children
carding
or
spinning
all
employed
from
the
youngest
to
the
oldest
scarce
anything
above
four
years
old
but
its
hands
were
sufficient
for
its
own
support
not
a
beggar
to
be
seen
nor
an
idle
person
except
here
and
there
in
an
built
for
those
that
are
antient
and
past
working
the
people
in
general
live
long
they
enjoy
a
good
air
and
under
such
circumstances
hard
labour
is
naturally
attended
with
the
blessing
of
health
if
not
to
the
capitalist
then
rather
than
to
the
inventor
civilization
owes
the
steam
engine
as
a
part
of
daily
life
and
matthew
boulton
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
the
race
of
producers
whose
reign
lasted
down
to
waterloo
as
far
back
as
tradition
runs
the
boultons
appear
to
have
been
northamptonshire
farmers
but
matthew
s
grandfather
met
with
misfortunes
under
william
and
sent
his
son
to
birmingham
to
seek
his
fortune
in
trade
there
the
adventurer
established
himself
as
a
silver
stamper
and
there
in
matthew
was
born
young
boulton
early
showed
both
energy
and
ingenuity
and
on
coming
of
age
became
his
father
s
partner
thenceforward
managing
the
business
in
two
years
after
the
conquest
of
bengal
the
father
died
and
matthew
having
married
in
might
have
retired
on
his
wife
s
property
but
he
chose
rather
to
plunge
more
deeply
into
trade
extending
his
works
he
built
the
famous
shops
at
soho
which
he
finished
in
at
an
outlay
of
a
debt
which
probably
clung
to
him
to
the
end
of
his
life
boulton
formed
his
partnership
with
watt
in
and
then
began
to
manufacture
the
but
he
met
with
formidable
difficulties
before
the
sales
yielded
any
return
the
outlay
reduced
him
to
the
brink
of
insolvency
nor
did
he
achieve
success
until
he
had
exhausted
his
own
and
his
friends
resources
he
mortgaged
his
lands
to
the
last
farthing
borrowed
from
his
personal
friends
raised
money
by
annuities
obtained
advances
from
bankers
and
had
invested
upwards
of
forty
thousand
pounds
in
the
enterprise
before
it
began
to
agriculture
as
well
as
industry
felt
the
impulsion
of
the
new
force
arthur
young
remarked
in
that
within
ten
years
there
had
been
more
experiments
more
discoveries
and
more
general
good
sense
displayed
in
the
walk
of
agriculture
than
in
an
hundred
preceding
ones
and
the
reason
why
such
a
movement
should
have
occurred
seems
obvious
after
a
complex
system
of
credit
sprang
up
based
on
a
metallic
treasure
and
those
who
could
borrow
had
the
means
at
their
disposal
of
importing
breeds
of
cattle
and
of
improving
tillage
as
well
as
of
organizing
factories
like
soho
the
effect
was
to
cause
rapid
centralization
the
spread
of
high
farming
certainly
raised
the
value
of
land
but
it
also
made
the
position
of
the
yeomanry
untenable
and
nothing
better
reveals
the
magnitude
of
the
social
revolution
wrought
by
plassey
than
the
manner
in
which
the
wastes
were
enclosed
after
the
middle
of
the
century
between
and
only
acres
of
the
commons
were
absorbed
between
and
nearly
in
eighty
years
the
yeomanry
became
extinct
many
of
these
small
farmers
migrated
to
the
towns
where
the
stronger
like
the
ancestor
of
sir
robert
peel
accumulated
wealth
in
industry
the
weaker
sinking
into
factory
hands
those
who
lingered
on
the
land
toiled
as
day
labourers
possibly
since
the
world
began
no
investment
has
ever
yielded
the
profit
reaped
from
the
indian
plunder
because
for
nearly
fifty
years
great
britain
stood
without
a
competitor
that
she
should
have
so
long
enjoyed
a
monopoly
seems
at
first
mysterious
but
perhaps
the
condition
of
the
continent
may
suggest
an
explanation
since
italy
had
been
ruined
by
the
loss
of
the
eastern
trade
she
had
ceased
to
breed
the
economic
mind
consequently
no
class
of
her
population
could
suddenly
and
violently
accelerate
their
movements
in
spain
the
priest
and
soldier
had
so
thoroughly
exterminated
the
sceptic
that
far
from
centralizing
during
the
seventeenth
century
as
england
and
france
had
done
her
empire
was
in
full
decline
at
the
revolution
of
in
france
something
similar
had
happened
though
in
a
much
less
degree
after
a
struggle
of
a
century
and
a
half
the
church
so
far
prevailed
in
as
to
secure
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
at
the
revocation
many
huguenots
went
into
exile
and
thus
no
small
proportion
of
the
economic
class
who
should
have
pressed
england
hardest
were
driven
across
the
channel
to
add
their
energy
to
the
energy
of
the
natives
germany
lacked
capital
hemmed
in
by
enemies
and
without
a
seacoast
she
had
been
at
a
disadvantage
in
predatory
warfare
accordingly
she
did
not
accumulate
money
and
failed
to
consolidate
until
in
she
extorted
a
treasure
from
france
thus
in
holland
alone
remained
as
a
competitor
rich
maritime
and
peopled
by
protestants
but
holland
lacked
the
mass
possessed
by
her
great
antagonist
beside
being
without
minerals
and
accordingly
far
from
accelerating
her
progress
she
proved
unable
to
maintain
her
relative
rate
of
advance
thus
isolated
and
favoured
by
mines
of
coal
and
iron
england
not
only
commanded
the
european
and
american
markets
at
a
time
when
production
was
strained
to
the
utmost
by
war
but
even
undersold
hindoo
labour
at
calcutta
in
some
imperfect
way
her
gains
may
be
estimated
by
the
growth
of
her
debt
which
must
represent
savings
in
when
clive
went
to
india
the
nation
owed
on
which
it
paid
an
interest
of
in
this
debt
had
swelled
to
with
an
annual
interest
charge
of
in
the
duke
of
bridgewater
finished
the
first
of
the
canals
which
were
afterward
to
form
an
inland
costing
or
more
than
of
the
amount
of
the
public
debt
at
the
outbreak
of
the
seven
years
war
meanwhile
also
steam
had
been
introduced
factories
built
turnpikes
improved
and
bridges
erected
and
all
this
had
been
done
through
a
system
of
credit
extending
throughout
the
land
credit
is
the
chosen
vehicle
of
energy
in
centralized
societies
and
no
sooner
had
treasure
enough
accumulated
in
london
to
offer
it
a
foundation
than
it
shot
up
with
marvellous
rapidity
from
to
plassey
the
growth
had
been
relatively
slow
for
more
than
sixty
years
after
the
foundation
of
the
bank
of
england
its
smallest
note
had
been
for
a
note
too
large
to
circulate
freely
and
which
rarely
travelled
far
from
lombard
street
writing
in
burke
mentioned
that
when
he
came
to
england
in
there
were
not
twelve
bankers
shops
in
the
provinces
though
then
he
said
they
were
in
every
market
town
thus
the
arrival
of
the
bengal
silver
not
only
increased
the
mass
of
money
but
stimulated
its
movement
for
at
once
in
the
bank
issued
and
notes
and
in
the
country
private
firms
poured
forth
a
flood
of
paper
at
the
outbreak
of
the
napoleonic
wars
there
were
not
far
from
four
hundred
provincial
houses
many
of
more
than
doubtful
solvency
macleod
who
usually
does
not
exaggerate
such
matters
has
said
that
grocers
tailors
and
drapers
inundated
the
country
with
their
miserable
rags
the
cause
of
this
inferiority
of
the
country
bankers
was
the
avarice
of
the
bank
of
england
which
prevented
the
formation
of
joint
stock
companies
who
might
act
as
competitors
and
as
the
period
was
one
of
great
industrial
and
commercial
expansion
when
the
adventurous
and
producing
classes
controlled
society
enough
currency
of
some
kind
was
kept
in
circulation
to
prevent
the
prices
of
commodities
from
depreciating
relatively
to
coin
the
purchasing
power
of
a
currency
is
other
things
being
equal
in
proportion
to
its
quantity
or
to
put
the
proposition
in
the
words
of
locke
the
value
of
money
in
general
is
the
quantity
of
all
the
money
in
the
world
in
proportion
to
all
the
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
many
causes
combined
to
make
money
plentiful
and
therefore
to
cheapen
it
not
only
was
the
stock
of
bullion
in
england
increased
by
importations
from
india
but
for
nearly
a
generation
exports
of
silver
to
asia
fell
off
from
an
average
of
annually
between
and
the
shipments
of
specie
by
the
east
india
company
fell
to
between
and
nor
did
they
rise
to
their
old
level
until
after
the
close
of
the
administration
of
hastings
when
trade
returned
to
normal
channels
after
the
stream
gathered
volume
and
between
and
the
yearly
consignment
amounted
to
or
to
nearly
of
the
precious
metals
yielded
by
the
mines
from
the
crusades
to
waterloo
the
producers
dominated
europe
the
often
faring
hardly
as
is
proved
by
the
treatment
of
the
jews
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
all
had
wares
to
sell
the
farmer
his
crop
the
weaver
his
cloth
the
grocer
his
goods
and
all
were
interested
in
maintaining
the
value
of
their
merchandise
relatively
to
coin
for
they
lost
when
selling
on
a
falling
market
by
degrees
as
competition
sharpened
after
the
reformation
a
type
was
developed
which
perhaps
may
be
called
the
merchant
adventurer
men
like
child
and
boulton
bold
energetic
audacious
gradually
energy
vented
itself
more
and
more
freely
through
these
merchants
until
they
became
the
ruling
power
in
england
their
government
lasting
from
to
at
length
they
fell
through
the
very
brilliancy
of
their
genius
the
wealth
they
amassed
so
rapidly
accumulated
until
it
prevailed
over
all
other
forms
of
force
and
by
so
doing
raised
another
variety
of
man
to
power
these
last
were
the
modern
bankers
with
the
advent
of
the
bankers
a
profound
change
came
over
civilization
for
contraction
began
had
from
the
outset
taught
the
producer
that
to
prosper
he
should
deal
in
wares
which
tended
rather
to
rise
than
fall
in
value
relatively
to
coin
the
opposite
instinct
possessed
the
usurer
he
found
that
he
grew
rich
when
money
appreciated
or
when
the
borrower
had
to
part
with
more
property
to
pay
his
debt
when
it
fell
due
than
the
cash
lent
him
would
have
bought
on
the
day
the
obligation
was
contracted
as
toward
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
great
hoards
of
london
passed
into
the
possession
of
men
of
the
latter
type
the
third
and
most
redoubtable
variety
of
the
economic
intellect
arose
to
prominence
a
variety
of
which
perhaps
the
most
conspicuous
example
is
the
family
of
rothschild
in
one
of
the
mean
and
dirty
houses
of
the
jewish
quarter
of
frankfort
mayer
amschel
was
born
in
the
year
the
house
was
numbered
in
the
judengasse
but
was
better
known
as
the
house
of
the
red
shield
and
gave
its
name
to
the
amschel
family
mayer
was
educated
by
his
parents
for
a
rabbi
but
judging
himself
better
fitted
for
finance
he
entered
the
service
of
a
hanoverian
banker
named
oppenheim
and
remained
with
him
until
he
had
saved
enough
to
set
up
for
himself
then
for
some
years
he
dealt
in
old
coins

when
asked
about

that
is
the
way

ostentatious

without

his

were

was

nathan
probably
won
his
chief
successes
by
skill
in
lending
and
in
this
branch
of
financiering
he
was
favoured
by
the
times
in
which
he
lived
during
the
long
wars
europe
plunged
into
debt
contracting
loans
in
depreciated
paper
or
in
coin
which
was
unprecedentedly
cheap
because
of
the
abundance
of
the
precious
metals
in
the
year
prices
reached
the
greatest
altitude
they
ever
attained
in
modern
or
even
perhaps
in
all
history
there
is
something
marvellously
impressive
in
this
moment
of
time
as
the
world
stood
poised
upon
the
brink
of
a
new
era
to
the
contemporary
eye
napoleon
had
reached
his
zenith
everywhere
victorious
he
had
defeated
the
english
in
spain
and
forced
the
army
of
moore
to
embark
at
corunna
while
at
wagram
he
had
brought
austria
to
the
dust
he
seemed
about
to
rival
cæsar
and
establish
a
military
empire
which
should
consolidate
the
nations
of
the
mainland
of
europe
yet
in
reality
one
of
those
vast
and
subtle
changes
was
impending
which
by
modifying
the
conditions
under
which
men
compete
alter
the
complexion
of
civilizations
and
which
has
led
in
the
course
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
the
decisive
rejection
of
the
martial
and
imaginative
mind
in
april
bolivar
obtained
control
at
caracas
and
with
the
outbreak
of
the
south
american
revolutions
the
gigantic
but
imaginative
empire
of
spain
passed
into
the
acute
stage
of
disintegration
on
december
of
the
same
year
the
emperor
alexander
opened
the
ports
of
russia
to
neutral
trade
by
so
doing
alexander
repudiated
the
continental
system
of
napoleon
made
a
breach
with
him
inevitable
and
thus
brought
on
the
campaign
of
moscow
the
destruction
of
the
grand
army
and
the
close
of
french
military
triumphs
on
the
hill
of

has
favoured
the
usurious

even
as

favoured

in

and
modern

of

described
the
panic
which
was
the
immediate
forerunner
of
the
rise
of
the
precious
metals
in
the
first
century
and
in
a
similar
panic
occurred
in
london
when
prices
suddenly
fell
fifteen
per
cent
and
when
the
most
famous
magnate
of
the
stock
exchange
was
ruined
and
killed
the
great
houses
of
baring
and
of
goldsmid
had
undertaken
the
negotiation
of
a

of

the
surprise
of
these
eminent
financiers

slowly
receded
and
in
september
the
death
of
sir
francis

precipitated
a
crisis
abraham

reduced

acutest

corpses
of

the
rothschilds
remained
the
dictators
of
the
markets
of
the
world
from
that
day
to
this
the
slow
contraction
has
continued
with
only
the
break
of
little
more
than
twenty
years
when
the
gold
of
california
and
australia
came
in
an
overwhelming
flood
and
from
that
day
to
this
the
same
series
of
phenomena
have
succeeded
one
another
which
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
marked
the
emasculation
of
rome
at
the
peace
many
causes
converged
to
make
specie
rise
the
exports
of
bullion
to
the
east
nearly
doubled
america
grew
vigorously
and
mining
was
interrupted
by
the
revolt
of
the
spanish
colonies
yet
favourable
as
the
position
of
the
creditor
class
might
be
it
could
be
improved
by
legislation
and
probably
no
financial
policy
has
ever
been
so
ably
conceived
or
so
adroitly
executed
as
that
masterpiece
of
which
gave
lombard
street
control
of
the
currency
of
great
britain
under
the
reign
of
the
producers
values
had
generally
been
equalized
by
cheapening
the
currency
when
prices
fell
in
the
fourteenth
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
the
penny
had
been
systematically
degraded
to
keep
pace
with
the
growing
dearth
of
silver
when
the
flood
of
the
peruvian
bullion
had
reached
its
height
in
the
currency
regained
its
fineness
but
in
the
penny
lost
another
of
weight
and
though
not
again
adulterated
at
the
mint
the
whole
coinage
suffered
so
severely
from
hard
usage
that
under
the
stuarts
it
fell
to
about
of
its
nominal
value
a
took
place
under
william
but
then
paper
came
in
to
give
relief
and
the
money
in
circulation
continued
to
degenerate
as
there
was
no
provision
for
the
withdrawal
of
light
pieces
by
the
loss
upon
even
the
guinea
had
become
so
great
that
parliament
intervened
and
lord
north
recommended
that
all
the
deficient
gold
coin
should
be
called
in
and
and
also
that
the
currency
of
the
gold
coin
should
in
future
be
regulated
by
weight
as
well
as
by
tale
and
that
the
several
pieces
should
not
be
legal
tender
if
they
were
diminished
by
wearing
or
otherwise
below
a
certain
weight
to
be
determined
by
by
such
means
as
this
the
integrity
of
the
metallic
money
was
at
length
secured
but
the
emission
of
paper
remained
unlimited
and
in
even
the
bank
of
england
suspended
cash
payments
then
prices
advanced
as
they
had
never
advanced
before
and
during
the
first
ten
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
commercial
adventurers
reached
their
meridian
from
they
declined
in
power
but
for
several
preceding
generations
they
had
formed
a
true
aristocracy
shaping
the
laws
and
customs
of
their
country
they
needed
an
abundant
currency
and
they
obtained
it
through
the
bank
on
their
side
the
directors
recognized
this
duty
to
be
their
chief
function
and
laid
it
down
as
a
principle
that
all
legitimate
commercial
paper
should
always
be
discounted
if
interest
rose
the
rise
proved
a
dearth
of
money
and
they
relieved
that
dearth
with
notes
lord
overstone
has
thus
explained
the
system
of
banking
which
was
accepted
without
question
until
a
supposed
obligation
to
meet
the
real
wants
of
commerce
and
to
discount
all
commercial
bills
arising
out
of
legitimate
transactions
appears
to
have
been
considered
as
the
principle
upon
which
the
amount
of
the
circulation
was
to
be
and
yet
strangely
enough
even
the
adversaries
of
this
system
admitted
that
it
worked
well
a
man
as
fixed
in
his
opinions
as
tooke
could
not
contain
his
astonishment
that
under
the
guidance
of
maxims
and
principles
so
unsound
and
of
such
apparently
mischievous
tendency
as
those
professed
by
the
governors
and
some
of
the
directors
of
the
bank
in
such
moderation
and
such
regularity
of
issue
should
under
chances
and
changes
in
politics
and
trade
unprecedented
in
violence
and
extent
have
been
preserved
as
that
a
spontaneous
readjustment
between
the
value
of
the
gold
and
the
paper
should
have
taken
place
as
it
did
without
any
reduction
of
their
with
such
a
system
the
currency
tended
to
fall
rather
than
to
rise
in
value
in
comparison
with
commodities
and
for
this
reason
the
owners
of
the
great
hoards
were
at
a
disadvantage
what
powerful
usurers
like
rothschild
wanted
was
a
legal
tender
fixed
in
quantity
which
being
unable
to
expand
to
meet
an
increased
demand
would
rise
in
price
moreover
they
needed
a
circulating
medium
sufficiently
compact
to
be
controlled
by
a
comparatively
small
number
of
capitalists
who
would
thus
under
favourable
conditions
hold
the
whole
debtor
community
at
their
mercy
if
the
year
be
taken
as
the
point
at
which
the
energy
stored
in
accumulations
of
money
began
to
predominate
in
england
the
revolution
which
ended
in
the
overthrow
of
the
producers
advanced
with
hardly
a
check
to
its
completion
by
the
bank
act
of
the
first
symptom
of
approaching
change
was
the
famous
bullion
committee
appointed
on
the
motion
of
francis
horner
in
this
report
is
most
interesting
for
it
marks
an
epoch
and
in
it
the
struggle
for
supremacy
between
the
lender
and
the
borrower
is
brought
out
in
full
relief
to
the
producer
the
commodity
was
the
measure
of
value
to
the
banker
coin
the
producer
sought
a
currency
which
should
retain
a
certain
ratio
to
all
commodities
of
which
gold
was
but
one
the
banker
insisted
on
making
a
fixed
weight
of
the
metal
he
controlled
the
standard
from
which
there
was
no
appeal
a
distinguished
merchant
named
chambers
in
his
evidence
before
the
committee
put
the
issue
in
a
nutshell
at
the
mint
price
of
standard
gold
in
this
country
how
much
gold
does
a
bank
of
england
note
for
one
pound
represent
dwts
grs
at
the
present
market
price
of
standard
gold
of
per
ounce
how
much
gold
do
you
get
for
a
bank
of
england
note
for
one
pound
dwts
grs
do
you
consider
that
a
bank
of
england
note
for
one
pound
under
these
present
circumstances
is
exchangeable
in
gold
for
what
it
represents
of
that
metal
i
do
not
conceive
gold
to
be
a
fairer
standard
for
bank
of
england
notes
than
indigo
or
although
the
bankers
controlled
the
bullion
committee
the
mercantile
interest
still
maintained
itself
in
parliament
and
the
resolutions
proposed
by
the
chairman
in
his
report
were
rejected
in
the
commons
by
a
majority
of
about
two
to
one
the
tide
however
had
turned
and
perhaps
the
best
index
of
the
moment
at
which
the
balance
of
power
shifted
may
be
the
course
of
peel
of
all
the
public
men
of
his
generation
peel
had
the
surest
instinct
for
the
strongest
force
rarely
if
ever
did
this
instinct
fail
him
and
after
his
intuition
led
him
to
separate
from
his
father
as
later
in
life
it
led
him
to
desert
his
party
in
the
crisis
of
the
first
sir
robert
peel
the
great
manufacturer
who
made
the
fortune
of
the
family
had
the
producer
s
instinct
and
utterly
opposed
contraction
in
he
voted
against
the
report
of
the
bullion
committee
and
then
his
son
voted
with
him
after
however
the
younger
peel
became
the
spokesman
of
lombard
street
and
the
story
is
told
that
when
the
bill
providing
for
cash
payments
passed
in
july
the
old
man
after
listening
to
his
son
s
great
speech
said
with
bitterness
robert
has
doubled
his
fortune
but
ruined
his
probably
waterloo
marked
the
opening
of
the
new
era
for
after
waterloo
the
bankers
met
with
no
serious
defeat
at
first
they
hardly
encountered
opposition
they
began
by
discarding
silver
in
the
government
made
grs
of
gold
the
unit
of
value
the
coin
representing
this
weight
of
metal
ceasing
to
be
a
legal
tender
when
deficient
by
about
half
a
grain
the
standard
having
thus
been
determined
it
remained
to
enforce
it
by
this
time
peel
had
been
chosen
by
the
creditor
class
as
their
mouthpiece
and
in
he
introduced
a
bill
to
provide
for
cash
payments
he
found
little
resistance
to
his
measure
and
proposed
as
the
time
for
the
return
as
it
happened
the
date
was
anticipated
and
notes
were
redeemed
in
gold
from
may
as
far
as
the
coinage
was
concerned
this
legislation
completed
the
work
but
the
task
of
limiting
discounts
remained
untouched
a
task
of
even
more
importance
for
as
long
as
the
bank
continued
discounting
bills
and
thus
emitting
an
unlimited
quantity
of
notes
whenever
the
rate
of
interest
rose
debtors
not
only
might
always
be
able
to
face
their
obligations
but
the
worth
of
money
could
not
be
materially
enhanced
this
question
was
decided
by
the
issue
of
the
panic
of
brought
on
by
the
resumption
act
at
the
suspension
of
paper
in
small
denominations
had
been
authorized
to
replace
the
coin
which
disappeared
but
this
act
expired
two
years
after
the
return
to
specie
payments
therefore
as
time
elapsed
the
small
issues
began
to
be
called
in
and
according
to
macleod
the
country
circulation
by
had
contracted
about
twelve
per
cent
the
bank
of
england
also
withdrew
a
large
body
of
notes
in
denominations
less
than
five
pounds
and
to
fill
the
gap
hoarded
some
twelve
million
sovereigns
a
mass
of
gold
about
equal
to
the
yield
of
the
mines
for
the
preceding
seven
or
eight
years
this
gold
had
to
be
taken
from
the
currency
of
europe
and
the
sudden
contraction
caused
a
shock
which
vibrated
throughout
the
west
in
france
gold
coinage
almost
ceased
and
prices
dropped
heavily
declining
per
cent
between
and
yet
perhaps
the
most
vivid
picture
of
the
distress
caused
by
this
absorption
of
gold
is
given
in
a
passage
written
by
macleod
to
prove
that
peel
s
act
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
catastrophe
there
was
one
perfectly
satisfactory
argument
to
show
that
the
low
prices
of
that
year
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
act
of
namely
that
prices
of
all
sorts
of
agricultural
produce
were
equally
depressed
all
over
the
continent
of
europe
from
the
same
cause
the
fluctuations
indeed
on
the
continent
were
much
more
violent
than
even
in
england
the
same
phenomena
were
observed
in
italy
a
similar
fall
but
not
to
so
great
an
extent
took
place
at
lisbon
what
could
the
act
of
have
to
do
with
these
places
the
severe
and
protracted
depression
while
affecting
all
producers
bore
with
peculiar
severity
upon
the
gentry
whose
estates
were
burdened
with
mortgages
and
all
kinds
of
settlements
so
much
so
that
frequently
properties
sank
below
their
encumbrances
and
the
owners
were
beggared
at
the
opening
of
parliament
both
houses
were
overwhelmed
with
petitions
for
aid
among
these
petitions
one
of
the
best
known
was
presented
to
the
commons
in
may
by
charles
andrew
thompson
of
chiswick
which
serves
to
show
the
keenness
of
the
distress
among
debtors
owning
land
thompson
stated
in
substance
that
in
he
and
his
father
being
wealthy
merchants
purchased
an
estate
in
hertfordshire
for
and
afterward
laid
out
more
in
improvements
that
in
they
entered
into
a
contract
for
another
estate
whose
price
was
but
a
question
having
arisen
as
to
the
title
a
lawsuit
intervened
and
before
judgment
the
petitioner
and
his
father
had
experienced
such
losses
that
they
could
not
pay
the
sum
adjudged
due
by
the
court
thereupon
to
raise
money
they
mortgaged
both
estates
for
in
july
both
estates
were
offered
for
sale
but
they
failed
to
bring
the
amount
for

which

through

depression
of

the

had
become
bankrupt
in
the

s
father

of

broken

he
himself
remained

children
of
his
own

of
his
brother

and
seven
of
his
sister

all
depending
on
him
the
nation
seemed
upon
the
brink
of
some
convulsion
for
the
gentry
hardly
cared
to
disguise
their
design
of
effecting
a
readjustment
of
both
public
and
private
debts
passions
ran
high
and
in
june
a
long
debate
followed
upon
a
motion
made
by
western
to
inquire
into
the
effects
produced
by
the
resumption
of
cash
payments
the
motion
was
indeed
defeated
but
defeated
by
a
concession
which
entailed
a
catastrophe
up
to
that
time
unequalled
in
the
experience
of
great
britain
to
save
the
resumption
act
the
ministry
in
july
brought
in
a
bill
to
respite
the
small
notes
until
a
measure
which
at
once
quieted
the
agitation
but
which
produced
the
most
and
unexpected
results
according
to
francis
the
country
banks
augmented
their
issues
fifty
per
cent
between
and
nor
was
this
increase
of
paper
the
only
or
the
most
serious
form
taken
by
the
inflation
the
great
hoard
of
sovereigns
accumulated
by
the
bank
to
replace
its
small
notes
was
made
superfluous
and
in
a
memorandum
delivered
by
the
directors
to
the
house
of
commons
no
less
than
were
stated
to
have
been
thrown
on
their
hands
in
by
this
change
of
policy
the
effect
was
to
create
a
veritable
glut
of
gold
in
the
united
kingdom
prices
rose
abnormally
fifteen
per
cent
between
and
as
values
tended
upward
a
frenzy
of
speculation
seized
upon
a
people
who
had
long
suffered
from
the
grinding
of
contraction
and
meanwhile
the
bank
adhering
to
its
old
policy
freely
discounted
all
the
sound
bills
brought
them
in
prices
rose
above
the
continental
level
and
gold
being
cheaper
in
london
than
in
paris
began
to
flow
thither
the
bank
reserve
steadily
fell
in
march
the
fever
reached
its
height
and
a
decline
set
in
while
the
directors
anxious
at
the
condition
of
their
reserve
in
may
attempted
to
restrict
their
issues
the
consequence
was
sharp
contraction
and
in
november
the
crash
came
huskisson
stated
in
the
house
of
commons
that
for
hours
it
was
impossible
to
convert
even
government
securities
into
cash
exchequer
bills
bank
stock
and
east
india
stock
were
alike
unsalable
and
many
of
the
richest
merchants
of
london
walked
the
streets
not
knowing
whether
on
the
morrow
they
might
not
be
insolvent
it
is
said
the
bank
itself
must
have
stopped
payment
and
that
we
should
have
been
reduced
to
a
state
of
barter
but
for
a
box
full
of
old
one
and
notes
which
was
discovered
by
what
happened
in
the
bank
parlour
during
those
days
is
unknown
probably
the
pressure
of
the
mercantile
classes
became
too
sharp
to
be
withstood
perhaps
even
the
strongest
bankers
were
alarmed
but
at
all
events
the
financial
policy
changed
completely
contraction
was
abandoned
the
bank
reverted
to
the
system
of
and
in
an
instant
relief
came
we
lent
by
every
possible
means
and
in
modes
we
had
never
adopted
before
we
not
only
discounted
outright
but
we
made
advances
on
deposit
of
bills
of
exchange
to
an
immense
the
bank
emitted
five
millions
in
notes
in
four
days
and
this
audacious
policy
was
crowned
with
the
most
complete
success
the
panic
was
stayed
almost
with
an
expansion
of
the
currency
sufficient
to
furnish
the
means
of
paying
debts
the
panic
passed
away
but
the
disaster
gave
the
bankers
their
opportunity
they
seized
it
and
thenceforward
their
hold
upon
the
community
never
even
for
an
instant
relaxed
the
administration
fell
into
discredit
and
turned
for
assistance
to
the
only
men
who
promised
to
give
them
effective
support
these
were
the
capitalists
of
lombard
street
whose
first
care
was
to
obtain
a
statute
prohibiting
the
small
notes
which
they
alleged
were
the
cause
of
the
misfortune
of
the
act
they
demanded
passed
in
and
about
this
time
samuel
loyd
rose
into
prominence
who
was
perhaps
the
greatest
financier
of
modern
times
cautious
and
sagacious
though
resolute
and
bold
gifted
with
an
amazing
penetration
into
the
complex
causes
which
control
the
competition
of
modern
life
he
swayed
successive
administrations
and
crushed
down
the
fiercest
opposition
apparently
he
never
faltered
in
his
course
and
down
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
sneered
at
the
directors
who
only
saved
themselves
from
bankruptcy
by
accidentally
remembering
and
issuing
a
parcel
of
old
discarded
notes
drawn
forth
from
a
refuse
cellar
in
loyd
s
father
began
life
somewhat
humbly
as
a
dissenting
minister
in
wales
but
after
his
marriage
he
entered
a
manchester
firm
and
subsequently
founded
in
london
the
house
of
jones
loyd
and
afterward
merged
in
the
london
and
westminster
bank
one
of
the
largest
concerns
in
the
world
samuel
did
not
actually
succeed
his
father
until
but
much
earlier
he
had
grown
to
be
the
recognized
chief
of
the
monied
interest
and
sir
robert
peel
long
served
as
his
lieutenant
loyd
was
the
man
who
conceived
the
bank
act
of
who
succeeded
in
laying
his
grasp
upon
the
currency
of
the
kingdom
and
in
whose
words
therefore
the
policy
of
the
new
governing
class
is
best
stated
a
is
the
substitution
of
paper
in
the
place
of
the
precious
metals
the
amount
of
it
ought
therefore
to
be
equal
to
what
would
have
been
the
amount
of
a
metallic
circulation
and
of
this
the
best
measure
is
the
influx
or
efflux
of
by
the
provisions
of
that
act
the
bank
act
of
it
is
permitted
to
issue
notes
to
the
amount
of
as
before
that
is
with
no
security
for
the
redemption
of
the
notes
on
demand
beyond
the
legal
obligation
so
to
redeem
them
but
all
fluctuations
in
the
amount
of
notes
issued
beyond
this
must
have
direct
reference
to
corresponding
fluctuations
in
the
amount
of
thus
loyd
s
principle
which
he
embodied
in
his
statute
was
the
rigid
limitation
of
the
currency
to
the
weight
of
gold
available
for
money
when
notes
are
permitted
to
be
issued
the
number
in
circulation
should
always
be
exactly
equal
to
the
coin
which
would
be
in
circulation
if
they
did
not
in
the
bank
act
was
extended
to
scotland
except
that
there
small
notes
were
still
tolerated
the
expansion
of
provincial
paper
was
prohibited
and
england
reverted
to
the
economic
condition
of
byzantium
a
condition
of
contraction
in
which
the
debtor
class
lies
prostrate
for
the
legal
tender
being
absolutely
limited
when
creditors
choose
to
withdraw
their
loans
payment
becomes
impossible
perhaps
no
financier
has
ever
lived
abler
than
samuel
loyd
certainly
he
understood
as
few
men
even
of
later
generations
have
understood
the
mighty
engine
of
the
single
standard
he
comprehended
that
with
expanding
trade
an
inelastic
currency
must
rise
in
value
he
saw
that
with
sufficient
resources
at
command
his
class
might
be
able
to
establish
such
a
rise
almost
at
pleasure
certainly
that
they
could
manipulate
it
when
it
came
by
taking
advantage
of
foreign
exchanges
he
perceived
moreover
that
once
established
a
contraction
of
the
currency
might
be
forced
to
an
extreme
and
that
when
money
rose
beyond
price
as
in
debtors
would
have
to
surrender
their
property
on
such
terms
as
creditors
might
dictate
furthermore
he
reasoned
that
under
pressure
prices
must
fall
to
a
point
lower
than
in
other
nations
that
then
money
would
flow
from
abroad
and
relief
would
ultimately
be
given
even
if
the
government
did
not
interfere
that
this
influx
of
gold
would
increase
the
quantity
of
money
by
so
doing
would
again
raise
prices
and
that
when
prices
rose
pledges
forfeited
in
the
panic
might
be
resold
at
an
advance
he
explained
the
principle
of
this
rise
and
fall
of
values
with
his
usual
lucidity
to
a
committee
of
the
house
of
lords
which
investigated
the
panic
of
monetary
distress
tends
to
produce
fall
of
prices
that
fall
of
prices
encourages
exports
and
diminishes
imports
consequently
it
tends
to
promote
an
influx
of
bullion
i
can
quote
a
fact
of
rather
a
striking
character
which
tends
to
show
that
a
contracting
operation
upon
the
circulation
tends
to
cheapen
the
cost
of
our
manufactured
productions
and
therefore
to
increase
our
he
then
stated
that
during
the
panic
he
had
received
a
letter
from
a
person
of
great
importance
in
lancashire
begging
him
to
use
his
influence
with
the
ministry
to
be
firm
in
maintaining
the
act
to
be
firm
in
resisting
these
applications
for
relaxation
because
in
lancashire
the
manufacturers
were
struggling
to
resist
the
improperly
high
price
of
the
raw
material
of
that
letter
reached
me
the
very
morning
that
the
letter
of
the
government
was
issued
suspending
the
act
and
almost
immediately
the
raw
cotton
rose
in
the
writer
of
that
letter
was
probably
a
man
of
considerable
substance
a
very
wealthy
man
with
abundant
capital
to
carry
on
his
business
he
had
recently
retired
from
business
i
can
state
another
circumstance
that
occurred
in
london
corroborative
of
the
same
results
within
half
an
hour
of
the
time
that
the
notes
summoning
the
court
of
directors
were
issued
parties
inferring
probably
that
a
relaxation
was
about
to
take
place
sent
orders
to
withdraw
goods
from
a
sale
which
was
then
going
the
history
of
half
a
century
has
justified
the
diagnosis
of
this
eminent
financier
as
followed
out
by
his
successors
loyd
s
policy
has
not
only
forced
down
prices
throughout
the
west
but
has
changed
the
aspect
of
civilization
in
england
the
catastrophe
began
with
the
passage
of
the
bank
act
no
sooner
had
this
statute
taken
effect
than
it
necessarily
caused
a
contraction
of
the
currency
at
a
time
when
gold
was
rising
because
of
commercial
expansion
between
and
there
was
a
fall
in
prices
of
per
cent
and
severe
as
may
have
been
the
decline
it
seems
moderate
considering
the
conditions
which
then
prevailed
the
yield
of
the
mines
was
scanty
and
of
this
yield
india
absorbed
annually
an
average
of
or
somewhat
more
than
america
was
growing
with
unprecedented
vigour
industrial
competition
sharpened
as
prices
fell
and
the
year
of
the
bank
act
was
the
year
in
which
railway
building
began
to
take
the
form
of
a
mania
the
peasantry
are
always
the
weakest
part
of
every
population
and
therefore
agricultural
prices
are
the
most
sensitive
but
the
resources
of
a
peasantry
are
seldom
large
and
as
the
value
of
their
crops
shrinks
the
margin
of
profit
on
which
they
live
dwindles
until
they
are
left
with
only
a
bare
subsistence
in
good
years
and
with
famine
facing
them
in
bad
the
irish
peasants
were
the
weakest
portion
of
the
population
of
great
britain
when
lord
overstone
became
supreme
and
when
the
potato
crop
failed
in
they
starved
although
the
landlords
had
lost
their
command
over
the
nation
in
they
yet
down
to
the
last
administration
of
peel
had
kept
strength
enough
to
secure
protection
from
parliament
against
foreign
competition
by
the
yeomanry
had
almost
disappeared
the
soil
belonged
to
a
few
rich
families
whose
revenue
depended
on
rents
and
the
value
of
rents
turned
on
the
price
of
the
cereals
to
sustain
the
market
for
wheat
became
therefore
to
the
aristocracy
and
when
with
the
peace
prices
collapsed
they
obtained
a
statute
which
prohibited
imports
until
the
bushel
should
fetch
ten
shillings
at
home
this
statute
though
frequently
amended
to
make
it
more
effective
partially
failed
of
its
purpose
a
contracting
currency
did
its
resistless
work
prices
dropped
tenants
went
bankrupt
and
as
the
value
of
money
rose
encumbered
estates
passed
more
frequently
into
the
hands
of
creditors
thus
when
peel
took
office
in
the
corn
laws
were
regarded
by
the
gentry
as
their
only
hope
and
peel
as
their
chosen
champion
but
only
a
few
years
elapsed
before
it
became
evident
that
the
policy
of
lombard
street
must
precipitate
a
struggle
for
life
between
the
manufacturers
and
the
landlords
in
the
famine
of
the
decisive
moment
came
and
when
sir
robert
sided
as
was
his
wont
with
the
strongest
and
abandoned
his
followers
to
their
fate
he
only
yielded
to
the
impulsion
of
a
resistless
force
as
a
class
both
landlords
and
manufacturers
were
debtors
and
by
cheap
bread
appeared
to
be
as
vital
to
the
one
as
dear
corn
was
to
the
other
with
a
steadily
falling
market
the
manufacturers
saw
their
margin
of
profit
shrink
and
at
last
manchester
and
birmingham
believed
themselves
to
be
confronted
with
ruin
unless
wages
fell
proportionately
or
they
could
broaden
the
market
for
their
wares
by
means
of
international
exchanges
the
corn
laws
closed
both
avenues
of
relief
therefore
there
was
war
to
the
death
between
the
manufacturers
and
the
aristocracy
the
savageness
of
the
attack
can
be
judged
by
cobden
s
jeers
at
gentlemen
who
admitted
that
free
corn
meant
insolvency
sir
edward
knatchbull
could
not
have
made
a
better
speech
for
the
league
than
that
which
he
made
lately
even
if
he
were
paid
for
it
i
roared
so
with
laughter
that
he
called
me
specially
to
order
and
i
begged
his
pardon
for
he
is
the
last
man
in
the
world
i
would
offend
we
are
all
so
much
obliged
to
him
he
said
they
could
not
do
without
this
corn
law
because
if
it
were
repealed
they
could
not
pay
the
jointures
charged
on
their
estates
lord
mountcashel
too
he
s
not
said
that
one
half
the
land
was
mortgaged
and
they
could
not
pay
the
interest
unless
they
had
a
tax
upon
bread
in
lancashire
when
a
man
gets
into
debt
and
can
t
pay
he
goes
into
the
and
what
is
good
for
a
manufacturer
is
i
think
good
for
a
in
such
a
contest
the
gentry
were
overmatched
for
they
were
but
nature
s
first
effort
toward
creating
the
economic
type
and
they
were
pitted
against
later
forms
which
had
long
distanced
them
in
the
competition
of
life
bright
and
cobden
as
well
as
loyd
and
peel
belonged
to
a
race
which
had
been
driven
into
trade
by
the
loss
of
their
freeholds
to
the
fortunate
ancestors
of
the
men
who
lay
at
their
mercy
in
peel
himself
was
the
son
of
a
and
the
grandson
of
a
yeoman
who
only
in
middle
life
had
quitted
his
to
make
his
fortune
in
the
industrial
in
modern
england
as
in
ancient
italy
the
weakest
sank
first
and
the
landed
gentry
succumbed
almost
without
resistance
to
the
combination
which
lombard
street
made
against
them
yet
though
the
manufacturers
seemed
to
triumph
their
exultation
was
short
for
the
fate
impended
over
them
even
in
the
hour
of
their
victory
which
always
overhangs
the
debtor
when
the
currency
has
been
seized
by
the
creditor
class
by
the
bank
act
the
usurers
became
supreme
and
in
the
potato
crop
failed
even
more
completely
than
in
credit
always
is
more
sensitive
in
england
than
in
france
because
it
rests
upon
a
narrower
basis
and
at
that
moment
it
happened
to
be
strained
by
excessive
railway
loans
with
free
trade
in
corn
large
imports
of
wheat
were
made
which
were
paid
for
with
gold
a
drain
set
in
upon
the
bank
the
reserve
was
depleted
and
by
october
the
directors
denied
all
further
advances
within
three
years
of
the
passage
of
his
statute
the
event
loyd
had
foreseen
arrived
monetary
distress
began
to
force
down
prices
the
decision
of
the
directors
to
refuse
discounts
created
a
great
excitement
on
the
stock
exchange
the
town
and
country
bankers
hastened
to
sell
their
public
securities
to
convert
them
into
money
the
difference
between
the
price
of
consols
for
ready
money
and
for
the
account
of
the
of
october
showed
a
rate
of
interest
equivalent
to
per

per

exchequer
bills
were
sold
at
a
complete
cessation
of

no

would
part

the
most
exorbitant

offered
to

could
arrive
in
sufficient
quantity
to
give
relief
the
currency
actually
in
use
offered
the
only
means
of
obtaining
legal
tender
for
the
payment
of
debts
consequently
hoarding
became
general
and
as
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
afterward
observed
an
amount
of
circulation
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
been
adequate
became
insufficient
for
the
wants
of
the
boxes
of
gold
and
in
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
pounds
were
deposited
with
the
merchants
the
chancellor
said
begged
for
notes
let
us
have
notes
we
don
t
care
what
the
rate
of
interest
is
only
tell
us
that
we
can
get
them
and
this
will
at
once
restore
but
after
october
no
notes
were
to
be
had
money
was
a
commodity
without
price
and
had
the
policy
of
the
bank
act
been
rigorously
maintained
english
debtors
whose
obligations
then
matured
must
have
forfeited
their
property
since
credit
had
ceased
to
exist
and
currency
could
not
be
obtained
wherewith
to
redeem
their
pledges
the
instinct
of
the
usurer
has
however
never
been
to
ruin
suddenly
the
community
in
which
he
has
lived
only
by
degrees
does
he
exhaust
human
vitality
therefore
when
the
great
capitalists
had
satisfied
their
appetites
they
gave
relief
from
the
to
the
of
october
contraction
was
allowed
to
do
its
work
then
overstone
intervened
the
government
was
instructed
to
suspend
the
act
and
the
community
was
promised
all
the
currency
it
might
require
the
effect
was
instantaneous
the
letter
from
the
cabinet
signed
by
lord
john
russell
which
recommended
the
directors
of
the
bank
to
increase
their
discounts
was
made
public
about
one
o
clock
on
monday
the
and
no
sooner
was
it
done
so
than
the
panic
vanished
like
a
dream
gurney
stated
that
it
produced
its
effect
in
ten
minutes
no
sooner
was
it
known
that
notes
be
had
than
the
want
of
them
ceased
large
parcels
of
notes
were
returned
to
the
bank
of
england
cut
into
halves
as
they
had
been
sent
down
into
the
the
story
of
this
crisis
demonstrates
that
by
the
had
become
autocratic
in
london
the
ministry
were
naturally
unwilling
to
suspend
a
statute
which
had
just
been
enacted
and
the
blow
to
sir
robert
peel
was
peculiarly
severe
but
the
position
of
the
government
admitted
of
no
alternative
at
the
time
it
was
said
that
the
private
bankers
of
london
intimated
to
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
that
unless
he
interfered
forthwith
they
would
withdraw
their
balances
from
the
bank
of
england
this
meant
insolvency
and
to
such
an
argument
there
was
no
reply
but
whether
matters
actually
went
so
far
or
not
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
cabinet
acted
under
the
dictation
of
lombard
street
for
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
defended
his
policy
by
declaring
that
the
act
had
not
been
suspended
until
those
conversant
with
commercial
affairs
and
least
likely
to
decide
in
favour
of
the
course
which
we
ultimately
adopted
unanimously
advised
that
relief
should
be
given
to
the
mercantile
community
there
was
extreme
suffering
throughout
the
country
which
manifested
itself
in
all
the
ways
the
revenue
fell
off
emigration
increased
wheat
brought
but
about
five
shillings
the
bushel
while
in
england
and
wales
alone
there
were
upwards
of
nine
hundred
thousand
paupers
discontent
took
the
form
of
chartism
and
a
revolution
seemed
imminent
nor
was
it
great
britain
only
which
was
convulsed
all
europe
was
shaken
to
its
centre
and
everything
portended
some
dire
convulsion
when
nature
intervened
and
poured
upon
the
world
a
stream
of
treasure
too
bountiful
to
be
at
once
controlled
in
the
first
californian
gold
reached
liverpool
in
four
years
the
supply
of
the
precious
metals
trebled
prices
rose
crops
sold
again
at
a
profit
as
the
farmers
grew
rich
the
demand
for
manufactures
quickened
wages
advanced
discontent
vanished
and
though
values
never
again
reached
the
altitude
of
they
at
least
attained
that
level
of
substantial
prosperity
which
preceded
the
french
revolution
nevertheless
the
fall
in
the
purchasing
power
of
money
and
the
consequent
ability
of
debtors
to
meet
their
obligations
did
not
excite
that
universal
joy
which
had
thrilled
europe
at
the
discovery
of
potosi
for
a
profound
change
had
passed
over
society
since
the
buccaneers
laid
the
foundations
of
england
s
fortune
by
the
plunder
of
the
peruvian
galleons
to
the
type
of
mind
which
predominated
after
the
permanent
rise
of
commodities
relatively
to
money
was
unwelcome
and
almost
from
the
opening
of
the
gold
discoveries
a
subtle
but
resistless
force
was
working
for
contraction
a
force
which
first
showed
itself
in
the
movement
for
an
uniform
gold
coinage
and
afterwards
in
general
gold
monometallism
the
great
change
came
with
the
conquest
of
france
by
germany
until
after
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
germany
held
only
a
secondary
position
in
the
economic
system
of
europe
because
of
her
poverty
with
few
harbours
she
had
reaped
little
advantage
from
the
plunder
of
america
and
india
exchanges
had
never
centred
within
her
borders
and
her
accumulated
capital
had
not
sufficed
to
stimulate
high
consolidation
the
conquest
of
france
suddenly
transformed
these
conditions
in
she
acquired
an
enormous
booty
and
the
effect
upon
her
was
akin
to
the
effect
on
england
of
the
confiscations
in
bengal
the
chief
difference
being
that
unlike
england
germany
passed
almost
immediately
into
the
period
of
contraction
the
spoliation
of
india
went
on
for
twenty
years
that
of
france
was
finished
in
a
few
months
and
while
in
england
the
industrial
revolution
intervened
between
plassey
and
the
adoption
of
the
gold
standard
in
germany
the
bankers
dominated
from
the
outset
the
government
belonged
to
the
class
which
desired
an
appreciating
currency
and
in
the
new
empire
followed
in
the
steps
of
lombard
street
and
demonetized
silver
germany
s
action
was
decisive
restrictions
were
placed
on
the
mints
of
the
latin
union
and
of
the
united
states
and
thus
by
degrees
the
whole
stress
of
the
trade
of
the
west
was
transferred
from
the
old
composite
currency
to
gold
alone
in
this
way
not
only
was
the
basis
of
credit
in
the
chief
commercial
states
cut
in
half
but
the
annual
supply
of
metal
for
coinage
was
diminished
in
the
gold
mined
fell
nearly
nine
per
cent
short
of
the
value
of
the
gold
and
silver
produced
in
and
yet
during
those
years
the
demand
for
money
must
have
increased
enormously
if
it
in
any
degree
corresponded
with
the
growth
of
trade
the
phenomena
which
followed
the
adoption
of
the
gold
standard
by
western
countries
were
precisely
those
which
had
been
anticipated
by
loyd
lord
overstone
had
explained
them
to
an
earlier
generation
in
one
of
his
letters
on
the
bank
charter
as
early
as
he
developed
the
whole
policy
of
the
usurers
if
a
country
increases
in
population
in
wealth
in
enterprise
and
activity
more
circulating
medium
will
probably
be
required
to
conduct
its
extended
transactions
this
demand
for
increased
circulation
will
raise
the
value
of
the
existing
circulation
it
will
become
more
scarce
and
more
valuable
in
other
words
gold
will
rise
by
the
action
of
germany
overstone
s
policy
was
extended
to
the
whole
western
world
with
the
results
he
had
foreseen
gold
appreciated
until
it
acquired
a
purchasing
power
unequalled
since
the
middle
ages
and
while
in
the
countries
prices
remained
substantially
unchanged
and
the
producers
accordingly
prospered
prostration
supervened
in
europe
the
united
states
and
australia
as
usual
the
rural
population
suffered
most
and
the
english
aristocracy
who
had
been
respited
by
the
gold
discoveries
were
the
first
to
succumb
they
not
only
drew
their
revenues
from
farming
land
but
standing
at
the
focus
of
competition
they
were
exposed
to
the
pressure
of
asia
and
america
alike
the
harvest
of
was
one
of
the
worst
of
the
century
land
depreciated
hopelessly
and
that
year
may
probably
be
taken
as
marking
the
downfall
of
a
class
which
had
maintained
itself
in
opulence
for
nearly
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
this
tudor
aristocracy
which
sprang
up
at
the
reformation
was
one
of
the
first
effects
of
the
quickened
movement
which
transferred
the
centre
of
exchanges
from
italy
to
the
north
sea
they
represented
sharpening
economic
competition
and
they
prospered
because
of
an
intellectual
gift
an
aptitude
they
enjoyed
of
absorbing
the
lands
of
the
priests
and
soldiers
amidst
whom
they
dwelt
these
soldiers
were
the
yeomen
who
when
evicted
became
pirates
slavers
commercial
adventurers
religious
colonists
and
conquerors
and
who
together
poured
the
flood
of
treasure
into
london
which
transmuted
into
movement
made
the
industrial
when
by
their
efforts
toward
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
sufficiently
vast
reservoirs
of
energy
in
the
shape
of
money
had
accumulated
a
new
race
rose
to
prominence
fitted
to
give
vent
to
this
force
men
like
nathan
rothschild
and
samuel
loyd
probably
endowed
with
a
subtler
intellect
and
a
keener
vision
than
any
who
had
preceded
them
financiers
beside
whom
the
usurers
of
byzantium
or
the
nobles
of
henry
were
pigmies
these
bankers
conceived
a
policy
unrivalled
in
brilliancy
which
made
them
masters
of
all
commerce
industry
and
trade
they
engrossed
the
gold
of
the
world
and
then
by
legislation
made
it
the
sole
measure
of
values
what
samuel
loyd
and
his
followers
did
to
england
in
became
possible
for
his
successors
to
do
to
all
the
gold
standard
nations
after
when
the
mints
had
been
closed
to
silver
the
currency
being
inelastic
the
value
of
money
could
be
manipulated
like
that
of
any
article
limited
in
quantity
and
thus
the
human
race
became
the
subjects
of
the
new
aristocracy
which
represented
the
stored
energy
of
mankind
from
the
moment
this
aristocracy
has
determined
on
a
policy
as
for
example
the
bank
act
or
monometallism
resistance
by
producers
becomes
most
difficult
being
debtors
producers
are
destroyed
when
credit
is
withdrawn
and
at
the
first
signs
of
insubordination
the
bankers
draw
in
their
gold
contract
their
loans
and
precipitate
a
panic
then
to
escape
immediate
ruin
the
debtor
yields
since
prices
have
generally
fallen
and
the
mortgage
has
tended
to
engulf
the
pledge
but
from
time
to
time
the
creditor
class
feels
the
need
of
turning
the
property
it
has
acquired
from
bankrupts
into
gold
and
then
the
rise
explained
by
overstone
takes
place
the
hoards
are
opened
credit
is
freely
given
the
quantity
of
currency
is
increased
values
rise
sales
are
made
and
new
adventurers
contract
fresh
obligations
then
this
expansion
is
followed
by
a
fresh
contraction
and
liquidation
is
repeated
on
an
scale
for
many
years
farming
land
has
fallen
throughout
the
west
as
it
fell
in
italy
in
the
time
of
pliny
everywhere
as
under
trajan
the
peasantry
are
distressed
everywhere
they
migrate
to
the
cities
as
they
did
when
rome
repudiated
the
denarius
by
the
census
of
the
united
kingdom
taken
in
not
only
did
it
appear
that
over
per
cent
of
the
inhabitants
of
england
and
wales
lived
in
towns
but
that
while
the
urban
districts
had
increased
above
fifteen
per
cent
since
the
last
census
the
population
of
the
purely
agricultural
counties
had
diminished
moreover
within
a
generation
there
has
been
a
marked
loss
of
fecundity
among
the
more
costly
races
the
rate
of
increase
of
the
population
has
diminished
in
the
united
states
it
is
generally
believed
that
the
old
native
american
blood
is
hardly
reproducing
itself
but
in
all
social
phenomena
france
precedes
other
nations
by
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
it
is
therefore
in
france
that
the
failure
of
vitality
is
most
plainly
seen
in
the
average
french
family
consisted
of
children
in
it
had
fallen
to
and
since
the
deaths
seem
to
have
equalled
the
births
in
legislation
was
attempted
to
encourage
productiveness
and
parents
of
seven
children
were
exempted
from
certain
classes
of
taxes
but
the
experiment
failed
levasseur
in
his
great
work
on
the
population
of
france
has
expressed
himself
almost
in
the
words
of
tacitus
it
can
be
laid
down
as
a
general
law
that
if
in
such
a
social
condition
as
that
of
the
french
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
number
of
children
is
small
it
is
because
the
majority
of
parents
wish
it
should
be
such
signs
point
to
the
climax
of
consolidation
and
yet
even
the
rise
of
the
bankers
is
not
the
only
or
the
surest
indication
that
centralization
is
culminating
the
destruction
wrought
by
accelerated
movement
of
the
less
tenacious
organisms
is
more
evident
below
than
above
is
more
striking
in
the
advance
of
cheap
labour
than
in
the
evolution
of
the
financier
chapter
xii
conclusion
apparently
nature
needs
to
consume
about
three
generations
in
perfecting
the
selection
of
a
new
type
accordingly
the
did
not
become
absolute
immediately
after
waterloo
and
a
period
of
some
sixty
years
followed
during
which
the
adventurers
kept
up
a
struggle
wherein
they
were
aided
by
the
discoveries
of
gold
near
the
middle
of
the
century
seemingly
they
met
their
final
defeat
at
sedan
for
the
decay
of
the
soldier
which
had
been
in
progress
since
the
fall
of
napoleon
reached
a
point
after
the
collapse
of
the
second
empire
even
lower
than
after
the
consolidation
of
rome
from
alaric
to
napoleon
the
soldier
had
served
as
an
independent
vent
to
energy
often
even
when
opposed
to
capital
he
had
been
victorious
and
the
highest
function
of
a
leader
of
men
had
been
in
theory
at
least
military
command
the
ideal
statesman
had
been
one
who
like
cromwell
frederic
the
great
henry
william
and
washington
could
lead
his
followers
in
battle
and
on
the
continent
down
to
the
aristocracy
had
professedly
been
a
military
caste
in
france
and
germany
the
old
tradition
lasted
to
within
a
generation
only
after
came
the
new
era
an
era
marked
by
many
social
changes
for
the
first
time
in
their
history
the
ruler
of
the
french
people
passed
admittedly
from
the
martial
to
the
monied
type
and
everywhere
the
same
phenomenon
appeared
the
whole
administration
of
society
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
economic
man
nothing
so
radical
happened
at
rome
or
even
at
byzantium
for
there
the
pressure
of
the
barbarians
necessitated
the
retention
of
the
commander
at
the
head
of
the
state
in
europe
he
lost
this
importance
since
the
capitulation
of
paris
the
soldier
has
tended
to
sink
more
and
more
into
a
paid
official
receiving
his
orders
from
financiers
with
his
salary
without
being
allowed
a
voice
even
in
questions
involving
peace
and
war
the
same
fate
has
overtaken
the
producing
classes
they
have
failed
to
maintain
themselves
and
have
become
subjects
of
the
possessors
of
hoarded
wealth
although
the
conventions
of
popular
government
are
still
preserved
capital
is
at
least
as
absolute
as
under
the
cæsars
and
among
capitalists
the
form
an
aristocracy
debtors
are
in
reality
powerless
because
of
the
extension
of
that
very
system
of
credit
which
they
invented
to
satisfy
their
needs
although
the
volume
of
credit
is
gigantic
the
basis
on
which
it
rests
is
so
narrow
that
it
may
be
manipulated
by
a
handful
of
men
that
basis
is
gold
in
gold
debts
must
be
paid
therefore
when
gold
is
withdrawn
the
debtor
is
helpless
and
becomes
the
servant
of
his
master
the
elasticity
of
the
age
of
expansion
has
gone
the
aristocracy
which
wields
this
autocratic
power
is
beyond
attack
for
it
is
defended
by
a
police
by
the
side
of
which
the
legions
were
a
toy
a
police
so
formidable
that
for
the
first
time
in
history
revolt
is
hopeless
and
is
not
attempted
the
only
question
which
preoccupies
the
ruling
class
is
whether
it
is
cheaper
to
coerce
or
to
bribe
on
looking
back
over
long
periods
of
time
the
sequence
of
causes
may
be
followed
which
have
led
to
this
result
first
inventions
from
the
east
facilitated
trade
then
the
perfection
of
weapons
of
attack
made
police
possible
and
individual
bravery
unnecessary
on
this
followed
the
abasement
of
the
martial
and
exaltation
of
the
economic
type
and
finally
that
intense
acceleration
of
movement
by
machinery
supervened
which
in
annihilating
space
has
destroyed
the
protection
that
the
costly
races
long
enjoyed
against
the
competition
of
simpler
organisms
roman
civilization
was
less
complex
than
modern
because
of
the
relative
inflexibility
of
the
latin
mind
unable
to
quicken
his
motions
by
inventions
the
ancient
italian
failed
to
discover
america
or
absorb
india
and
for
the
same
reason
collapsed
without
an
effort
under
the
insidious
attack
of
asiatic
and
african
labour
no
industrial
expansion
followed
the
influx
of
bullion
under
cæsar
and
therefore
when
the
value
of
cereals
fell
the
evicted
farmer
either
sank
into
slavery
or
begged
for
bread
from
the
magnates
of
the
senate
in
modern
times
an
industrial
period
has
intervened
the
evicted
long
found
employment
in
the
factories
of
the
towns
and
it
has
only
been
as
contraction
has
reduced
the
demand
for
merchandise
by
diminishing
the
purchasing
power
of
the
agricultural
population
that
those
stagnant
pools
of
the
unemployed
have
collected
which
exactly
correspond
to
the
proletariat
but
as
each
special
faculty
which
for
a
time
enables
its
possessor
to
excel
in
competition
seems
to
bear
with
it
the
seeds
of
its
own
decay
so
the
inventive
which
once
enabled
the
western
races
to
undersell
the
eastern
in
their
homes
seems
destined
to
reduce
all
to
a
common
economic
level
as
rome
sank
to
the
level
of
egypt
for
nearly
a
century
the
inventions
of
hargreaves
of
crompton
of
cartwright
and
of
watt
enabled
lancashire
to
supply
bombay
and
calcutta
with
fabrics
as
in
the
seventeenth
century
surat
and
calicut
had
supplied
london
and
this
superiority
appeared
assured
until
orientals
should
acquire
the
momentum
necessary
for
machinery
one
effect
in
europe
was
the
rapid
increase
of
a
population
congregated
in
towns
and
bearing
a
marked
resemblance
to
the
humiliores
of
rome
in
their
disinclination
for
war
true
to
their
instincts
the
adventurers
ever
quickened
their
movements
ever
extended
the
sphere
of
their
enterprises
and
finally
just
as
the
second
empire
verged
upon
its
fall
they
opened
the
suez
canal
in
the
consequences
of
this
great
engineering
triumph
have
probably
equalled
in
gravity
the
establishment
of
the
gold
standard
but
the
two
phenomena
had
this
marked
difference
the
producers
saw
their
danger
and
resisted
to
the
utmost
the
contraction
of
the
currency
whereas
the
canal
was
a
case
of
suicide
thenceforward
grain
raised
by
the
most
enduring
labour
of
the
world
could
be
thrown
without
limit
on
the
european
market
and
agricultural
competition
once
established
industrial
could
only
be
a
question
of
time
the
canal
made
the
importation
and
the
reparation
of
machinery
cheap
throughout
asia
from
a
period
perhaps
as
remote
as
clive
s
victories
the
hindoos
had
experienced
a
certain
impulsion
from
contact
with
the
british
but
it
was
not
until
the
building
of
railroads
under
lord
dalhousie
that
the
severer
phases
of
competition
opened
among
the
inhabitants
of
india
lord
dalhousie
became
governor
general
in
and
that
the
acceleration
of
the
next
nine
years
culminated
in
a
catastrophe
seems
certain
for
nothing
can
be
plainer
than
that
the
mutiny
of
was
an
outbreak
of
a
martial
mohammedan
population
crushed
under
an
intolerable
pressure
the
locality
of
the
disturbance
alone
is
enough
to
demonstrate
the
accuracy
of
this
inference
dalhousie
s
last
act
was
the
annexation
of
the
kingdom
of
oude
of
this
province
lucknow
is
the
capital
and
while
lucknow
was
one
focus
of
the
insurrection
delhi
the
capital
of
the
ancient
mogul
empire
was
the
other
once
subdued
by
the
british
and
reduced
to
an
economic
equality
with
subtler
races
the
old
moslem
gentry
rapidly
disappeared
since
these
families
which
had
maintained
themselves
for
six
or
seven
hundred
years
have
rapidly
fallen
into
ruin
and
their
estates
have
been
bought
by
their
creditors
the
rising
usurer
class
under
immemorial
native
custom
the
generally
speaking
had
no
forcible
means
of
collecting
debt
he
relied
on
public
opinion
and
conducted
himself
accordingly
on
the
other
hand
unrestricted
alienation
of
land
was
not
usually
incidental
to
proprietorship
and
thus
the
tenant
for
life
as
he
would
be
called
in
english
law
could
only
pledge
his
crops
he
could
not
sell
the
succession
with
centralization
came
full
ownership
and
with
it
summary
process
for
debt
following
her
immutable
law
nature
having
changed
the
form
of
competition
proceeded
to
select
a
quality
of
mind
to
correspond
with
the
new
conditions
of
life
she
demanded
improved
vents
for
her
energy
forthwith
under
the
pressure
of
accelerated
movement
and
advancing
consolidation
the
trammels
of
caste
relaxed
the
population
fused
and
a
new
aristocracy
arose
composed
of
the
strongest
economic
types
culled
from
all
the
peoples
who
inhabit
the
plains
south
of
the
himalayas
this
aristocracy
is
a
strange
mixture
of
blood
an
amalgam
of
the
most
diverse
elements
of
parsees
brahmins
bunniahs
of
different
races
with
gifted
individuals
from
other
castes
like
the
or
the
goldsmiths
but
among
them
all
the
most
ruthless
the
corruptest
the
most
hated
and
the
most
successful
are
the
marwaris
who
have
been
thus
described
by
a
british
commission
the
average
marwari
is
not
a
pleasant
character
to
analyze
his
most
prominent
characteristics
are
love
of
gain
and
indifference
to
the
opinions
or
feelings
of
his
neighbour
he
has
considerable
and
immense
industry
but
the
nature
of
his
business
and
the
method
by
which
it
is
pursued
would
tend
to
degrade
and
harden
even
a
humane
nature
which
his
is
not
as
a
landlord
he
follows
the
instincts
of
the
usurer
making
the
hardest
terms
possible
with
his
tenant
who
is
also
his
debtor
and
often
little
better
than
his
the
effect
of
the
selection
of
such
a
type
as
a
dominant
class
must
be
destructive
to
a
martial
population
whether
it
be
french
or
english
mohammedan
or
hindoo
the
social
revolution
which
swept
over
oude
after
its
annexation
has
been
referred
to
but
the
fate
which
overtook
the
famous
mahratta
nation
is
even
more
tragic
and
impressive
when
toward
the
close
of
the
last
century
the
british
were
pushing
their
conquests
inland
the
most
formidable
enemy
they
met
were
the
mahrattas
and
perhaps
the
most
renowned
battle
next
to
plassey
ever
fought
by
europeans
against
natives
was
assaye
where
wellesley
defeated
sindhia
in
these
mahrattas
were
tribes
of
hindoo
farmers
who
inhabited
the
mountainous
country
about
one
hundred
miles
to
the
east
of
bombay
a
territory
of
which
poona
has
always
been
considered
the
capital
mounted
on
their
hill
ponies
these
bold
and
hardy
spearmen
were
always
ready
to
follow
their
chiefs
to
battle
and
in
the
eighteenth
century
became
the
terror
not
only
of
the
mohammedans
of
the
deccan
but
of
the
mogul
himself
at
delhi
even
the
english
respected
and
feared
them
and
only
subdued
them
in
after
desperate
fighting
then
they
were
disarmed
and
subjected
to
the
combined
action
of
peace
and
english
law
soon
after
this
conquest
an
inflow
of
marwaris
began
as
early
as
in
dalhousie
s
administration
captain
anderson
stated
that
of
the
ryots
were
in
the
hands
of
the
marwaris
and
that
the
average
debt
of
each
individual
was
not
less
than
rs
competition
continued
unchecked
as
time
flowed
on
and
in
disturbances
broke
out
in
certain
villages
near
poona
serious
enough
to
cause
the
government
to
appoint
a
commission
of
inquiry
after
full
investigation
this
commission
reported
that
up
to
or
the
peasantry
had
seemed
relatively
prosperous
but
that
afterward
prices
fell
quickly
and
that
this
fall
had
been
accompanied
by
a
rise
in
taxation
of
somewhat
more
than
fifty
per
cent
under
this
double
pressure
the
peasantry
had
rapidly
sunk
into
insolvency
and
the
whole
real
estate
of
the
deccan
was
passing
into
the
hands
of
usurers
while
the
farmers
had
become
serfs
toiling
on
the
soil
they
had
once
owned
to
satisfy
an
inextinguishable
debt
precisely
like
the
the
delinquent
was
not
evicted
but
remained
recorded
as
occupier
of
his
holding
and
responsible
for
the
payment
of
revenue
assessed
on
it
but
virtually
reduced
by
pressure
of
debt
to
a
sweated
by
his
marwari
creditor
it
is
in
that
creditor
s
power
to
eject
him
any
day
and
if
allowed
to
hold
on
it
is
only
on
condition
of
paying
over
to
his
creditor
all
the
produce
of
his
land
not
absolutely
necessary
for
next
year
s
seed
grain
or
for
the
support
of
life
he
is
indebted
on
an
average
to
the
extent
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
payment
of
the
government
revenue
he
has
nothing
to
hope
for
but
lives
in
daily
fear
of
the
final
since
assaye
three
generations
have
passed
away
and
the
mahratta
spearmen
have
vanished
the
western
ghats
are
now
tilled
by
a
sluggish
race
whom
the
british
officers
deem
unworthy
of
their
cavalry
and
in
the
place
of
those
renowned
and
daring
chiefs
sivaji
and
holkar
stands
the
marwari
under
whom
no
ryots
can
prosper
save
those
who
having
received
some
education
are
able
to
combat
the
sowkars
with
their
own
weapons
fraud
chicanery
and
even
apparently
the
same
destiny
awaits
every
people
which
requires
more
than
the
minimum
of
nutriment
or
which
is
not
gifted
with
the
economic
mind
for
the
sweep
off
the
crops
as
soon
as
harvested
only
leaving
with
the
ryots
barely
sufficient
to
eke
out
a
subsistence
till
the
following
that
allowance
in
the
deccan
is
estimated
at
about
a
dollar
a
month
in
silver
too
little
to
sustain
any
but
the
most
tenacious
organisms
even
among
asiatics
consequently
though
the
population
of
india
is
increasing
rapidly
the
increase
lies
chiefly
among
the
aboriginal
tribes
who
form
the
lowest
castes
or
in
other
words
among
the
or
servile
races
men
who
though
enslaved
by
the
aryan
invaders
of
prehistoric
times
and
who
have
always
been
subjected
to
extremest
hardship
have
been
gifted
like
the
egyptian
fellah
with
an
endurance
which
has
enabled
them
to
survive
herein
likewise
may
be
plainly
perceived
the
destructive
effects
of
the
policy
of
the
western
usurers
upon
the
population
subject
to
them
by
enhancing
the
value
of
their
own
money
they
have
nearly
doubled
the
intensity
of
this
asiatic
competition
in
india
silver
has
substantially
retained
its
purchasing
power
therefore
the
ryot
now
as
in
the
days
of
captain
cunningham
can
exist
on
two
rupees
a
month
but
he
can
not
live
on
less
accordingly
the
severity
of
his
competition
with
europeans
must
be
measured
by
the
value
of
his
wages
when
reckoned
on
the
european
scale
in
the
ryot
s
two
rupees
were
worth
one
dollar
now
through
the
appreciation
of
gold
they
are
worth
about
sixty
cents
and
the
effect
is
the
same
as
though
the
tenacity
of
life
of
the
asiatic
had
been
increased
everything
the
indian
or
chinese
peasant
produces
with
his
hands
whether
on
the
farm
or
in
the
factory
has
been
reduced
in
price
in
relation
to
western
peoples
in
the
ratio
of
six
to
ten
the
cheapest
form
of
labour
is
thus
being
bred
on
a
gigantic
scale
and
this
labour
is
being
accelerated
by
an
industrial
development
which
is
stimulated
by
eviction
of
the
farmers
as
the
industrial
revolution
was
stimulated
in
england
one
hundred
and
thirty
years
ago
for
many
years
the
cotton
mills
of
bombay
have
undersold
lancashire
in
the
coarser
fabrics
and
when
by
means
of
a
canal
to
the
pacific
american
cotton
can
be
imported
cheaply
they
will
spin
the
finer
also
moreover
hindostan
is
full
of
iron
and
coal
which
has
never
been
utilized
because
of
the
immense
difference
in
the
rapidity
of
european
and
asiatic
labour
but
the
steadily
falling
range
of
western
prices
must
force
the
cheapest
product
on
the
market
and
when
the
indian
railways
have
been
assumed
by
the
government
a
new
era
will
have
opened
the
same
causes
are
affecting
china
and
japan
and
under
precisely
similar
conditions
the
centre
of
exchanges
passed
from
the
tiber
to
the
bosphorus
sixteen
hundred
years
ago
such
uniformity
of
development
in
the
most
distant
times
and
among
the
most
divergent
peoples
points
to
a
progressive
law
of
civilization
each
stage
of
progress
being
marked
by
certain
intellectual
moral
and
physical
changes
as
the
attack
in
war
masters
the
defence
and
the
combative
instinct
becomes
unnecessary
to
the
preservation
of
life
the
economic
supersedes
the
martial
mind
being
superior
in
as
velocity
augments
and
competition
intensifies
nature
begins
to
sift
the
economic
minds
themselves
culling
a
favoured
aristocracy
of
the
craftiest
and
the
subtlest
types
choosing
for
example
the
armenian
in
byzantium
the
marwari
in
india
and
the
jew
in
london
conversely
as
the
costly
nervous
system
of
the
soldier
becomes
an
encumbrance
organisms
which
can
exist
on
less
successively
supplant
each
other
until
the
limit
of
endurance
is
reached
thus
the
slavs
exterminated
the
greeks
in
thrace
and
macedonia
the
mahrattas
and
the
moslems
dwindle
before
the
low
caste
tribes
of
india
and
the
instinct
of
has
taught
white
races
to
resist
an
influx
of
chinese
when
nature
has
finished
this
double
task
civilization
has
reached
its
zenith
humanity
can
ascend
no
higher
in
view
of
this
possible
extermination
of
the
martial
blood
in
the
higher
stages
of
civilization
the
attention
necessarily
becomes
concentrated
on
what
is
perhaps
the
main
point
of
divergence
between
ancient
and
modern
society
the
presence
and
the
absence
of
a
supply
of
barbaric
life
all
the
evidence
points
to
the
conclusion
that
the
infusion
of
vitality
which
rome
ever
drew
from
territories
beyond
her
borders
was
the
cause
both
of
her
strength
and
of
her
longevity
without
such
aid
she
could
never
have
consolidated
the
world
on
the
other
hand
the
lack
of
this
resource
has
been
the
weakness
of
modern
nations
one
after
another
they
have
dreamed
of
universal
conquest
and
one
after
another
they
have
fallen
through
exhaustion
in
war
spain
levied
never
a
pikeman
in
america
and
her
colonies
were
a
source
of
debility
in
so
far
as
they
drained
her
of
her
youth
had
rome
been
similarly
situated
she
could
hardly
have
carried
the
eagles
beyond
the
bosphorus
and
the
alps
perhaps
cæsar
s
army
was
the
best
an
ancient
general
ever
put
in
the
field
and
yet
it
was
filled
with
barbarians
all
his
legions
were
raised
north
of
the
po
and
most
of
them
including
the
tenth
north
of
the
alps
when
pitted
against
this
force
native
italians
broke
in
rout
and
one
of
the
most
striking
pages
of
plutarch
is
the
story
of
the
gradual
awakening
of
pompey
to
a
sense
of
the
impotence
of
romans
pompey
himself
was
a
commander
of
high
ability
and
until
he
split
upon
the
rock
of
the
pure
martial
blood
battle
had
been
with
him
synonymous
with
victory
at
first
he
felt
such
confidence
he
laughed
at
the
suggestion
of
an
attack
within
the
rubicon
with
the
conviction
of
the
conqueror
he
said
whenever
i
stamp
with
my
foot
in
any
part
of
italy
there
will
rise
up
forces
enough
in
an
instant
both
horse
and
a
very
short
experience
of
the
men
of
the
north
sufficed
to
sober
him
for
though
cæsar
s
command
amounted
to
only
thousand
and
his
to
twice
as
many
he
not
only
declined
an
action
but
took
what
care
he
could
to
keep
the
threats
of
the
gauls
from
his
men
who
were
out
of
heart
and
despondent
through
terror
at
the
fierceness
and
hardiness
of
their
enemies
whom
they
looked
upon
as
a
sort
of
wild
pharsalia
stunned
him
when
the
tenth
legion
routed
his
left
wing
he
went
to
his
tent
and
sat
speechless
until
the
invasion
of
the
camp
then
he
walked
away
softly
afoot
taken
up
altogether
with
thoughts
such
as
probably
might
possess
a
man
that
for
the
space
of
years
together
had
been
accustomed
to
conquest
and
victory
and
was
then
at
last
in
his
old
age
learning
for
the
first
time
what
defeat
and
flight
thus
in
reality
barbarians
consolidated
the
ancient
world
and
the
force
which
created
the
empire
afterward
upheld
it
with
each
succeeding
century
the
drafts
of
centralized
society
upon
the
blood
of
the
country
beyond
the
danube
and
the
rhine
increased
but
the
supply
proved
limitless
and
when
the
western
provinces
disintegrated
a
new
imaginative
race
poured
over
italy
and
france
creating
a
new
religion
a
new
art
a
new
literature
and
new
institutions
among
modern
nations
the
russians
alone
have
developed
this
power
of
absorbing
kindred
conquered
peoples
and
yet
obviously
napoleon
would
have
fought
his
campaigns
under
very
different
circumstances
and
perhaps
brought
them
to
a
different
end
had
he
like
cæsar
had
an
exhaustless
supply
of
the
best
soldiers
altogether
independent
of
the
population
of
france
religious
phenomena
become
explicable
when
viewed
from
the
same
standpoint
unquestionably
scepticism
has
been
to
the
full
as
rife
in
paris
since
as
it
ever
was
in
rome
and
yet
no
new
religion
has
been
born
supposing
however
that
a
vast
and
highly
emotional
emigration
flowed
annually
into
france
the
aspect
of
life
would
be
completely
changed
christian
saints
and
martyrs
were
not
begotten
by
the
usurers
of
constantinople
or
of
rome
but
by
barbarian
soldiers
and
asiatic
serfs
and
christianity
could
hardly
have
become
a
state
religion
had
the
composition
of
society
as
it
existed
under
trajan
remained
unaltered
even
in
the
reign
of
justinian
the
aristocracy
carped
at
faith
and
byzantine
architecture
did
not
bloom
until
the
invasions
of
alaric
and
attila
if
then
although
nature
never
precisely
repeats
herself
she
operates
upon
the
human
mind
according
to
immutable
laws
it
should
be
possible
by
comparing
a
living
civilization
with
a
dead
to
estimate
in
some
degree
the
course
which
has
been
run
for
such
an
attempt
an
infinite
variety
of
standards
might
be
suggested
but
few
perhaps
are
more
suitable
than
the
domestic
relations
which
lie
at
the
basis
of
the
reproduction
of
life
in
a
martial
and
imaginative
age
where
energy
vents
itself
through
fear
and
every
man
must
be
a
soldier
the
family
generally
forms
a
unit
the
women
and
children
being
under
the
control
of
the
father
as
they
were
under
the
control
of
the
patriarchs
in
the
bible
or
of
the
paterfamilias
in
rome
in
such
periods
the
woman
is
sought
after
by
the
man
and
even
commands
a
high
money
value
and
shechem
said
unto
her
father
ask
me
never
so
much
dowry
and
gift
and
i
will
give
according
as
ye
shall
say
unto
me
but
give
me
the
damsel
to
the
homeric
heroes
bought
their
wives
and
moreover
were
very
fond
of
them
an
affection
the
women
returned
for
in
all
classical
literature
there
are
few
more
charming
legends
than
that
of
penelope
divorce
was
unknown
to
hector
and
agamemnon
ulysses
and
achilles
marriage
in
these
simple
ages
is
usually
a
rite
half
sacred
half
warlike
when
abraham
s
servant
found
rebekah
at
the
well
he
bowed
his
head
and
blessed
the
lord
god
of
his
master
abraham
which
had
led
him
in
the
right
way
a
roman
wedding
was
a
solemn
religious
function
accompanied
by
prayer
and
sacrifice
and
at
the
end
the
bride
was
carried
to
her
husband
s
house
where
she
was
violently
torn
from
her
mother
s
arms
aristotle
with
his
unerring
acumen
made
this
observation
that
all
warlike
races
are
prone
to
the
love
of
women
and
also
that
they
tend
to
fall
under
the
dominion
of
their
undoubtedly
this
is
the
instinct
of
the
soldier
and
in
martial
ages
women
are
idealized
when
a
foreigner
asked
the
wife
of
leonidas
why
do
you
lacedæmonian
wives
unlike
all
others
govern
your
husbands
the
spartan
answered
because
we
alone
are
the
mothers
of
when
at
rome
tiberius
killed
the
male
serpent
thereby
devoting
himself
to
death
to
save
cornelia
plutarch
telling
the
story
remarked
that
tiberius
seemed
to
all
men
to
have
done
nothing
unreasonable
in
choosing
to
die
for
such
a
woman
who
when
king
ptolemy
himself
proffered
her
his
crown
and
would
have
married
her
refused
it
and
chose
rather
to
live
a
in
the
middle
ages
that
greatest
of
martial
and
imaginative
epochs
marriage
developed
into
the
most
solemn
of
sacraments
and
the
worship
of
women
became
the
popular
religion
in
france
especially
the
centre
of
thought
enthusiasm
and
war
from
the
mighty
fane
of
paris
downward
the
churches
were
dedicated
to
mary
and
the
vow
of
chivalry
bound
the
knight
to
fight
for
god
and
for
his
lady
it
hath
bene
through
all
ages
ever
seene
that
with
the
praise
of
armes
and
chevalrie
the
prize
of
beautie
still
hath
ioyned
it
might
almost
be
said
that
the
destinies
of
france
have
been
moulded
by
men
s
love
for
women
and
that
this
influence
still
prevailed
down
to
the
advent
of
the
usurers
after
the
rout
of
waterloo
on
the
other
hand
nature
bred
a
type
of
woman
fit
to
mate
with
the
imaginative
man
the
devotion
of
saint
clara
to
saint
francis
is
one
of
the
most
exquisite
lyrics
of
the
church
and
for
six
hundred
years
héloïse
remained
an
ideal
of
the
west
perhaps
indeed
that
strange
blending
of
tenderness
and
enthusiasm
which
was
peculiar
to
the
mediæval
mind
never
found
more
refined
and
exalted
expression
than
in
the
simple
hymn
which
héloïse
is
said
to
have
composed
and
sung
at
the
grave
of
abélard
tecum

in
primitive
ages
children
are
not
only
a
source
of
power
but
of
wealth
and
therefore
the
highest
merit
of
the
woman
is
fecundity
and
they
blessed
rebekah
and
said
unto
her
be
thou
the
mother
of
thousands
of
also
maternity
is
then
a
glory
and
childlessness
a
shame
and
rachel
said
give
me
children
or
else
i
and
she
conceived
and
bare
a
son
and
said
god
hath
taken
away
my
that
she
might
live
for
her
boys
cornelia
refused
a
crown
and
when
they
grew
up
she
would
upbraid
them
because
the
romans
as
yet
rather
called
her
the
daughter
of
scipio
than
the
mother
of
the
but
cornelia
s
father
was
the
conqueror
of
hannibal
and
her
son
was
an
agrarian
agitator
whom
the
monied
oligarchy
murdered
for
reviving
the
licinian
laws
apparently
one
of
the
first
signs
of
advancing
civilization
is
the
fall
in
the
value
of
women
in
men
s
eyes
not
very
long
after
the
siege
of
troy
husbands
must
have
ceased
paying
for
their
wives
for
at
a
comparatively
early
date
they
demanded
a
price
for
wedding
them
euripides
born
in
made
medea
complain
that
women
had
to
buy
their
husbands
for
great
sums
of
money
in
other
words
the
custom
of
the
wedding
portion
had
come
to
prevail
as
the
pressure
of
economic
competition
intensifies
with
social
consolidation
the
family
regularly
disintegrates
the
children
rejecting
the
parental
authority
at
a
steadily
decreasing
age
until
finally
the
population
fuses
into
a
compact
mass
in
which
all
individuals
are
equal
before
the
law
and
all
are
forced
to
compete
with
each
other
for
the
means
of
subsistence
when
at
length
wealth
has
accumulated
sufficiently
to
find
vent
through
capitalistic
methods
of
farming
and
manufacture
children
lose
all
value
for
then
hiring
labour
is
always
cheaper
than
breeding
thenceforward
among
the
more
extravagant
races
the
family
dwindles
as
in
ancient
rome
or
modern
france
and
marriage
having
become
a
luxury
decreases
moreover
the
economic
instinct
impels
parents
to
reduce
the
number
of
possible
inheritors
of
their
property
that
its
bulk
may
not
shrink
upon
women
the
effect
of
these
changed
conditions
is
prodigious
their
whole
relation
to
society
is
altered
from
a
religious
sacrament
marriage
is
metamorphosed
into
a
civil
contract
dissoluble
like
other
contracts
by
mutual
consent
and
as
the
obligations
of
maternity
diminish
the
relation
of
husband
and
wife
resolves
itself
into
a
sort
of
business
partnership
tending
always
to
become
more
ephemeral
frequent
as
divorce
now
is
it
was
even
more
so
under
the
antonines
on
men
the
action
of
natural
selection
is
at
least
as
drastic
the
change
wrought
in
roman
character
in
about
three
hundred
years
has
always
been
one
of
the
problems
of
history
in
the
words
of
aristotle
the
primitive
roman
was
prone
to
the
love
of
strong
in
his
passions
austere
in
his
life
fierce
in
his
jealousy
he
set
the
undisputed
possession
of
the
female
as
his
supreme
happiness
virginius
slew
his
daughter
to
keep
her
from
appius
claudius
and
his
comrades
in
the
legions
washed
out
his
wrong
in
the
decemvir
s
blood
while
among
the
stirring
ballads
of
the
fabled
time
which
were
sung
at
the
farmer
s
fireside
none
roused
such
emotion
as
the
tale
of
the
vengeance
wreaked
on
tarquin
for
lucretia
s
death
compare
this
virile
race
with
the
aristocracy
of
the
middle
empire
by
the
second
century
female
purity
weighed
light
against
money
marcus
aurelius
is
said
to
have
condensed
the
whole
economic
moral
code
in
one
short
sentence
his
wife
faustina
was
accused
by
scandal
of
being
the
most
abandoned
woman
of
her
generation
more
notorious
even
than
had
been
messalina
when
the
philosopher
was
urged
to
repudiate
her
he
replied
then
i
should
have
to
surrender
her
portion
the
empire
and
he
not
only
lived
with
her
but
built
a
temple
to
her
memory
even
if
the
story
be
false
it
reflects
none
the
less
truly
the
temper
of
the
age
the
minds
of
noble
romans
of
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
under
the
same
impulsion
worked
differently
from
those
of
their
primitive
ancestors
they
lacked
the
martial
and
the
amatory
instincts
as
a
general
rule
one
salient
characteristic
of
the
later
reigns
was
a
sexual
lassitude
yielding
only
to
the
most
potent
stimulants
the
same
phenomena
were
noticed
among
frenchmen
at
the
collapse
of
the
empire
since
when
like
symptoms
have
become
notorious
in
london
taking
history
as
a
whole
women
seem
never
to
have
more
than
moderately
appealed
to
the
senses
of
the
economic
man
the
monied
magnate
seldom
ruins
himself
for
love
and
chivalry
would
have
been
as
foreign
to
a
roman
senator
under
diocletian
as
it
would
be
now
to
a
lombard
street
banker
on
the
other
hand
in
proportion
as
women
s
influence
has
declined
when
measured
by
their
power
over
men
it
has
increased
when
measured
by
the
economic
standard
in
many
ways
the
female
seems
to
serve
as
a
vent
for
the
energy
of
capital
almost
as
well
as
men
in
the
higher
planes
of
civilization
they
hold
their
property
in
severalty
and
by
means
of
money
wield
a
power
not
unlike
faustina
s
if
unmarried
the
economic
woman
competes
with
the
man
on
nearly
equal
terms
and
everywhere
and
in
all
ages
the
result
is
not
dissimilar
the
stronger
and
more
fortunate
members
of
the
sex
have
grown
rich
and
have
bought
social
and
political
power
roman
politics
under
septimius
severus
and
caracalla
was
much
in
the
hands
of
women
and
julia
mæsa
who
was
enormously
wealthy
carried
through
a
most
famous
intrigue
by
purchasing
the
throne
for
elagabalus
in
rome
however
there
was
always
a
strong
admixture
of
barbaric
blood
and
to
the
last
the
barbarians
married
for
love
justinian
was
an
example
born
of
an
obscure
race
of
barbarians
in
the
desolate
bulgarian
country
he
fell
uncontrollably
in
love
with
theodora
who
had
scandalized
even
the
theatres
of
constantinople
his
mother
died
of
shame
but
justinian
persevered
and
while
she
lived
his
devotion
to
his
wife
never
wavered
in
rome
and
in
byzantium
such
women
were
the
stronger
or
the
more
fortunate
their
counterparts
are
easily
to
be
found
in
any
economic
age
the
fate
of
the
weaker
there
was
slavery
now
they
are
forced
by
competition
into
the
ranks
of
the
cheapest
labour
a
lot
perhaps
hardly
preferable
and
yet
art
perhaps
even
more
clearly
than
religion
love
or
war
indicates
the
pathway
of
consolidation
for
art
reflects
with
the
subtlest
delicacy
those
changes
in
the
forms
of
competition
which
enfeeble
or
inflame
the
imagination
of
greek
art
in
its
zenith
little
need
be
said
its
great
qualities
have
been
too
fully
recognized
it
suffices
to
point
out
that
it
was
absolutely
honest
and
that
it
formed
a
vehicle
of
expression
as
flexible
as
the
language
itself
a
temple
apparently
of
marble
was
of
marble
a
colonnade
apparently
supporting
a
portico
did
support
it
and
while
the
ornament
formed
an
integral
part
of
the
structure
the
people
read
it
as
intelligently
as
they
read
the
poems
of
homer
nothing
similar
ever
flourished
in
rome
unlike
the
greeks
the
romans
were
never
sensitive
or
imaginative
properly
speaking
they
had
nothing
which
they
could
express
through
art
they
were
utilitarian
from
the
outset
and
their
architecture
finally
took
shape
in
the
most
perfect
system
of
materialistic
building
which
probably
has
ever
existed
obviously
such
a
system
could
only
be
matured
in
a
capitalistic
society
and
accordingly
roman
architecture
only
reached
perfection
somewhat
late
perhaps
toward
the
close
of
the
first
century
the
romans
though
vulgar
and
ostentatious
understood
business
they
knew
how
to
combine
economy
and
even
solidity
with
display
as
has
observed
they
were
rich
and
they
wanted
to
appear
so
but
they
strove
to
attain
their
end
without
waste
therefore
they
first
ran
up
a
cheap
core
of
rubble
bricks
and
mortar
which
could
be
put
together
by
rude
slave
labour
under
the
direction
of
an
engineer
and
a
few
overseers
and
their
squalid
interior
they
afterward
veneered
with
marble
adding
by
way
of
ornament
tier
above
tier
of
greek
columns
ranged
against
the
walls
that
gaudy
exterior
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
building
itself
and
could
be
stripped
off
without
vital
injury
from
the
greek
standpoint
nothing
could
be
falser
more
insulting
to
the
intelligence
or
in
a
word
more
plutocratic
but
the
work
was
sound
and
durable
and
to
a
certain
degree
imposing
from
its
mass
this
system
lasted
substantially
unimpaired
even
to
constantine
or
until
the
final
migration
of
capital
to
the
bosphorus
the
only
difference
between
the
monuments
of
the
fourth
century
and
the
first
being
that
the
former
are
somewhat
coarser
just
as
the
coins
of
diocletian
are
coarser
than
those
of
nero
yet
although
the
monied
aristocracy
remained
supreme
down
to
the
final
disintegration
of
the
west
emigration
began
very
early
to
modify
the
base
of
society
by
the
injection
of
a
considerable
amount
of
imaginative
blood
and
as
early
as
the
reign
of
claudius
this
new
store
of
energy
made
its
presence
felt
through
the
outlet
of
christianity
the
converts
were
of
course
the
antipodes
of
the
ruling
class
they
were
humiliores
poor
people
below
the
notice
of
a
rich
man
like
tacitus
quos
vulgus
christianos
these
christians
held
a
position
analogous
to
that
of
nihilists
now
whom
they
resembled
save
in
respect
to
violence
they
were
socialists
living
under
a
monied
despotism
and
they
openly
prayed
for
the
end
of
the
world
therefore
they
were
thought
haters
of
the
human
race
and
they
suffered
the
penalty
primitive
christianity
was
incompatible
with
the
existence
of
roman
society
against
which
it
was
a
protest
for
it
fully
accepted
the
idea
that
the
rich
if
he
did
not
surrender
his
superfluity
kept
what
belonged
to
by
right
the
kingdom
of
heaven
was
closed
to
the
wealthy
probably
very
few
of
these
early
christians
were
italians
most
of
them
were
from
the
levant
and
that
they
were
intensely
emotional
is
proved
by
their
lust
for
martyrdom
they
voluntarily
sought
death
as
a
means
of
glorifying
god
one
day
arrius
antoninus
proconsul
of
asia
having
ordered
certain
christians
arrested
saw
all
the
faithful
of
the
town
present
themselves
before
his
tribunal
demanding
to
share
the
fate
of
those
chosen
for
martyrdom
he
dismissed
them
in
wrath
telling
them
that
if
they
were
so
in
love
with
death
they
might
commit
suicide
and
renan
s
account
of
the
persecutions
under
nero
shows
an
incredible
exaltation
almost
at
once
the
effect
of
this
emotional
temperament
became
perceptible
the
paintings
in
the
catacombs
are
perhaps
the
oldest
example
of
christian
art
and
of
these
vitet
thus
spoke
many
years
ago
these
decorations
made
with
the
hand
raised
in
secret
hurriedly
and
more
for
pious
reasons

for

the
most
rebellious
eyes
and
in
spite
of
strange
negligence
and
incorrectness
i
know
not
what
of
animation
of
youth
of
fecundity
and
so
to
speak
a
real
transformation
of
that
very
art
which
in
the
service
of
paganism
seemed
then
we
are
all
agreed
dying
of
as
the
world
disintegrated
and
the
imagination
everywhere
acquired
power
and
with
power
wealth
and
the
means
of
expression
an
entirely
new
architecture
sprang
up
in
the
east
whose
growth
closely
followed
upon
the
barbarian
invasions
and
the
progressive
failure
of
the
roman
blood
the
system
of
construction
was
asiatic
modified
by
greek
influences
and
with
this
new
construction
came
an
equally
new
decoration
a
decoration
which
once
more
served
as
a
language
mosaics
of
stone
had
long
been
used
but
mosaics
of
glass
which
give
such
an
incomparable
lustre
to
the
dome
were
the
invention
of
levantine
christians
and
seem
to
have
come
into
general
use
toward
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
century
but
the
fifth
century
was
the
period
of
the
great
invasions
of
alaric
attila
and
theoderic
and
during
this
period
the
population
of
italy
macedonia
and
thrace
must
have
undergone
profound
changes
in
italy
the
whole
fabric
of
consolidated
society
crumbled
south
of
the
danube
it
survived
but
survived
in
a
modified
form
a
form
on
which
the
recent
migrations
left
an
unmistakable
imprint
galla
placidia
the
first
great
patron
of
the
pure
byzantine
school
died
in
after
an
eventful
life
largely
passed
among
the
barbarians
one
of
whom
she
married
she
began
to
embellish
ravenna
and
a
comparison
of
these
remains
with
those
of
france
and
italy
of
the
eleventh
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
exposes
the
difference
in
the
forces
which
moulded
these
three
civilizations
with
all
its
grace
and
refinement
the
characteristic
of
ravenna
was
not
religious
ecstasy
but
rather
an
absence
of
fear
of
the
unknown
and
a
respect
for
wealth
there
is
nothing
mysterious
or
terrible
about
these
charming
buildings
which
are
manifestly
rather
a
glorification
of
the
empire
on
the
bosphorus
than
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
at
san
vitale
it
is
justinian
with
an
aureole
about
his
head
and
surrounded
by
his
courtiers
carrying
a
gift
to
the
shrine
or
theodora
blazing
with
jewels
and
followed
by
the
magnificent
ladies
of
her
household
at
san
apollinare
the
long
procession
of
saints
are
richly
clad
and
bear
crowns
while
the
virgin
herself
seated
on
a
throne
and
revered
as
a
sovereign
is
as
far
removed
from
the
vulgar
as
theodora
herself
byzantine
etiquette
no
longer
permits
her
to
be
approached
directly
four
angels
surround
her
and
separate
her
from
the
terrifying
was
scrupulously
avoided
by
a
most
significant
scruple
the
artist
in
reproducing
various
episodes
of
the
passion
avoided
the
most
painful
the
saint
sophia
offers
every
indication
of
having
been
expressly
contrived
to
provide
the
large
light
spaces
needful
for
such
functions
as
those
depicted
in
san
vitale
and
the
account
given
by
procopius
of
its
erection
sustains
this
supposition
according
to
procopius
saint
sophia
was
a
hobby
of
justinian
who
not
only
selected
the
architect
anthemius
because
he
was
the
most
ingenious
mechanic
of
his
age
but
who
also
supplied
the
funds
and
assisted
it
by
the
labour
and
powers
of
his
the
dome
from
the
lightness
of
the
building
does
not
appear
to
rest
upon
a
solid
foundation
but
to
cover
the
place
beneath
as
though
it
were
suspended
from
heaven
by
the
fabled
golden
chain
and
the
interior
is
singularly
full
of
light
and
of
sunshine
you
would
declare
that
the
place
is
not
lighted
by
the
sun
from
without
but
that
the
rays
are
produced
within
itself
such
an
abundance
of
light
is
poured
into
this
of
the
decorations
it
is
impossible
to
speak
with
certainty
since
it
is
probable
that
the
mosaics
which
now
exist
were
of
a
later
period
perhaps
however
the
most
significant
phenomenon
about
the
church
is
its
loneliness
nothing
like
it
was
built
elsewhere
and
the
reason
seems
plain
there
was
but
one
imperial
court
which
needed
so
superb
a
setting
and
but
one
emperor
who
could
pay
for
it
herein
lies
the
radical
divergence
between
the
east
and
west
the
great
tabernacle
of
constantinople
stood
alone
because
it
represented
the
wealth
the
pomp
and
the
imagination
of
the
barbarian
shepherd
who
had
been
raised
by
fortune
to
be
the
chief
of
police
of
the
city
where
the
world
s
wealth
had
centralized
in
france
every
diocese
had
a
temple
magnificent
according
to
its
means
some
of
which
exceeded
in
majesty
that
of
paris
and
the
cause
was
that
in
france
the
artistic
and
imaginative
caste
formed
a
theocracy
who
were
not
hired
by
king
or
emperor
but
who
were
themselves
the
strongest
force
in
all
the
land
in
the
east
the
imaginative
inroad
was
not
strong
enough
to
cause
disintegration
and
the
artists
always
remained
in
the
west
society
fell
back
a
thousand
years
and
consolidation
began
afresh
six
centuries
intervened
between
the
death
of
galla
placidia
and
the
famous
dream
of
the
monk
gauzon
which
contained
the
revelation
of
the
plan
of
the
abbey
of
cluny
and
yet
six
hundred
years
by
no
means
represented
the
gap
between
the
franks
and
the
burgundians
and
the
eastern
empire
even
when
it
sank
lowest
under
heraclius
to
justinian
the
building
of
saint
sophia
was
a
matter
of
time
and
money
to
saint
hugh
the
church
of
cluny
was
a
miracle
in
france
the
churches
long
were
miracles
the
chronicles
are
filled
with
the
revelations
vouchsafed
the
monks
and
none
can
cross
the
threshold
of
one
of
these
noble
monuments
and
fail
to
grasp
its
meaning
they
are
the
most
vigorous
of
all
expressions
of
fear
of
the
unseen
the
gothic
architect
heeded
no
living
potentate
he
held
kings
in
contempt
and
oftener
represented
them
thrust
down
into
hell
than
seated
on
their
thrones
with
the
enemy
who
lurked
in
darkness
none
but
the
saints
could
cope
and
them
he
idealized
no
sculpture
is
more
terrible
than
the
demons
on
the
walls
of
rheims
none
more
majestic
and
pathetic
than
that
over
the
door
of
the
virgin
at
paris
while
no
colour
ever
equalled
the
windows
of
saint
denis
and
chartres
with
the
thirteenth
century
came
the
influx
of
the
eastern
trade
and
the
rise
of
the
communes
immediately
the
glory
of
the
gothic
began
to
fade
by
the
reign
of
saint
louis
it
had
passed
its
prime
and
under
philip
the
fair
it
fell
in
full
decline
the
men
who
put
dead
cats
in
shrines
were
not
likely
to
be
inspired
in
religious
sculpture
the
decay
and
the
reasons
for
it
can
be
readily
traced
in
colour
the
monks
who
conceived
the
twelfth
century
windows
or
painted
the
pictures
of
the
saints
only
sought
to
render
an
emotion
by
a
conventional
symbol
which
should
rouse
a
response
consequently
they
used
marvellous
combinations
of
colours
in
which
blue
was
apt
to
predominate
and
they
harmonized
their
colours
with
gold
has
elaborately
explained
how
this
was
done
but
such
a
system
was
not
pretentious
and
was
incompatible
with
perspective
the
mediæval
burgher
like
the
roman
was
rich
and
wanted
to
appear
so
he
demanded
more
for
his
money
than
a
solemn
portrait
of
a
saint
he
craved
a
picture
of
himself
or
of
his
guild
and
above
all
he
insisted
on
display
the
fourteenth
century
was
the
period
when
the
reds
and
yellows
superseded
the
blues
and
when
the
sense
of
harmony
began
to
fail
furthermore
the
burgher
was
realistic
and
required
a
representation
of
the
world
he
saw
about
him
hence
came
perspective
the
abandonment
of
gold
and
the
final
degradation
of
colour
which
sank
into
a
lost
art
for
hundreds
of
years
it
has
been
impossible
to
imitate
the
work
of
the
monks
of
saint
denis
in
italy
the
economic
phenomena
were
yet
more
striking
for
italy
even
in
the
middle
ages
was
always
a
commercial
community
which
looked
on
art
with
the
economic
eye
one
example
will
suffice
the
treatment
of
the
dome
placed
between
the
masterpieces
of
the
east
and
west
and
having
little
imagination
of
his
own
the
florentine
banker
conceived
the
idea
of
combining
the
two
systems
and
embellishing
them
in
a
cheap
and
showy
manner
accordingly
on
gothic
arches
he
placed
an
eastern
dome
and
instead
of
adorning
his
dome
with
mosaics
which
are
costly
he
had
his
interior
painted
at
about
of
the
price
the
substitution
of
the
fresco
for
the
mosaic
is
one
of
the
most
typical
devices
of
modern
times
before
the
opening
of
the
economic
age
when
the
imagination
glowed
with
all
the
passion
of
religious
enthusiasm
the
monks
who
built
the
abbeys
of
cluny
and
saint
denis
took
no
thought
of
money
for
it
regarded
them
not
sheltered
by
their
convents
their
livelihood
was
assured
their
bread
and
their
robe
were
safe
they
pandered
to
no
market
for
they
cared
for
no
patron
their
art
was
not
a
chattel
to
be
bought
but
an
inspired
language
in
which
they
communed
with
god
or
taught
the
people
and
they
expressed
a
poetry
in
the
stones
they
carved
which
far
transcended
words
for
these
reasons
gothic
architecture
in
its
prime
was
spontaneous
elevated
dignified
and
pure
the
advent
of
portraiture
has
usually
been
considered
to
portend
decay
and
rightly
since
the
presence
of
the
portrait
demonstrates
the
supremacy
of
wealth
a
portrait
can
hardly
be
the
ideal
of
an
enthusiast
like
the
figure
of
a
god
for
it
is
a
commercial
article
sold
for
a
price
and
manufactured
to
suit
a
patron
s
taste
were
it
made
to
please
the
artist
it
might
not
find
a
buyer
when
portraits
are
fashionable
the
economic
period
must
be
well
advanced
portraiture
like
other
economic
phenomena
blossomed
during
the
renaissance
and
it
was
then
also
that
the
artist
no
longer
shielded
by
his
convent
or
his
guild
stood
out
to
earn
his
living
by
the
sale
of
his
wares
like
the
venetian
merchants
whom
he
met
on
the
rialto
whose
vanity
he
flattered
and
whose
palaces
he
adorned
from
the
sixteenth
century
downward
the
man
of
imagination
unable
to
please
the
economic
taste
has
starved
this
mercenary
quality
forms
the
gulf
which
has
divided
the
art
of
the
middle
ages
from
that
of
modern
times
a
gulf
which
can
not
be
bridged
and
which
has
broadened
with
the
lapse
of
centuries
until
at
last
the
artist
like
all
else
in
society
has
become
the
creature
of
a
commercial
market
even
as
the
greek
was
sold
as
a
slave
to
the
plutocrat
of
rome
with
each
invention
with
each
acceleration
of
movement
prose
has
more
completely
supplanted
poetry
while
the
economic
intellect
has
grown
less
tolerant
of
any
departure
from
those
representations
of
nature
which
have
appealed
to
the
most
highly
gifted
of
the
monied
type
among
successive
generations
hence
the
imperiousness
of
modern
realism
thus
the
history
of
art
coincides
with
the
history
of
all
other
phenomena
of
life
for
experience
has
demonstrated
that
since
the
reformation
a
school
of
architecture
like
the
greek
or
gothic
has
become
impossible
no
such
school
could
exist
in
a
society
where
the
imagination
had
decayed
for
the
greek
and
gothic
represented
imaginative
ideals
in
an
economic
period
like
that
which
has
followed
the
reformation
wealth
is
the
form
in
which
energy
seeks
expression
therefore
since
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
architecture
has
reflected
money
has
said
of
the
romans
that
like
all
parvenus
the
true
expression
of
art
lay
for
them
rather
in
lavish
ornament
than
in
purity
of
form
and
what
was
true
of
the
third
century
is
true
of
the
nineteenth
the
type
of
mind
being
the
same
its
operation
must
be
similar
and
the
economic
at
once
ostentatious
and
parsimonious
produces
a
cheap
core
fantastically
adorned
the
romans
perched
the
travesty
of
a
grecian
colonnade
upon
the
summit
of
a
bath
or
an
amphitheatre
while
the
englishman
having
pillaged
weaker
nations
of
their
imaginative
gems
delights
to
cover
with
coarse
imitations
the
exterior
of
banks
and
and
yet
though
thus
alike
a
profound
difference
separates
roman
architecture
from
our
own
the
romans
were
never
wholly
sordid
nor
did
they
ever
niggle
when
they
built
a
wall
that
wall
was
solid
masonry
not
painted
iron
and
even
down
to
constantine
one
chord
remained
which
when
struck
would
always
vibrate
usurers
may
have
sat
in
the
senate
but
barbarians
filled
the
legions
and
as
long
as
the
triumph
wound
its
way
through
the
forum
men
knew
how
to
raise
triumphal
arches
to
the
victor
perhaps
in
all
the
ages
no
more
serious
or
majestic
monument
has
been
conceived
to
commemorate
the
soldier
than
the
column
of
trajan
a
monument
which
it
has
been
the
ambition
of
our
century
to
copy
in
paris
an
imitation
of
this
trophy
was
erected
to
the
greatest
captain
of
france
and
the
column
of
the
place
vendôme
serves
to
mark
the
grave
of
the
modern
martial
blood
raised
in
almost
at
the
moment
when
nathan
rothschild
became
despot
of
the
london
stock
exchange
the
tide
from
thence
ran
swiftly
and
since
sedan
the
present
generation
has
drained
to
the
lees
the
cup
of
realism
no
poetry
can
bloom
in
the
arid
modern
soil
the
drama
has
died
and
the
patrons
of
art
are
no
longer
even
conscious
of
shame
at
profaning
the
most
sacred
of
ideals
the
ecstatic
dream
which
some
monk
cut
into
the
stones
of
the
sanctuary
hallowed
by
the
presence
of
his
god
is
reproduced

these
phenomena
have
grown
more
sharply
marked
in
europe
and
as
consolidation
apparently
nears
its
climax

to
presage
approaching
disintegration
