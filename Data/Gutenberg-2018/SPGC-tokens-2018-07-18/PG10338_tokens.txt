introduction
while
belgium
is
bleeding
and
hoping
while
poland
suffers
and
dreams
of
liberation
while
serbia
is
waiting
for
redemption
there
is
a
little
country
the
soul
of
which
is
torn
to
pieces
a
little
country
that
is
so
remote
so
remote
that
her
ardent
sighs
can
not
be
heard
it
is
the
country
of
perpetual
sacrifice
the
country
that
saw
abraham
build
the
altar
upon
which
he
was
ready
to
immolate
his
only
son
the
country
that
moses
saw
from
a
distance
stretching
in
beauty
and
loveliness
a
land
of
promise
never
to
be
attained
the
country
that
gave
the
world
its
symbols
of
soul
and
spirit
palestine
no
war
correspondents
no
red
cross
or
relief
committees
have
gone
to
palestine
because
no
actual
fighting
has
taken
place
there
and
yet
hundreds
of
thousands
are
suffering
there
that
worst
of
agonies
the
agony
of
the
spirit
those
who
have
devoted
their
lives
to
show
the
world
that
palestine
can
be
made
again
a
country
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
those
who
have
dreamed
of
reviving
the
spirit
of
the
prophets
and
the
great
teachers
are
hanged
and
persecuted
and
exiled
their
dreams
shattered
their
holy
places
profaned
their
work
ruined
cut
off
from
the
world
with
no
bread
to
sustain
the
starving
body
the
heavy
boot
of
a
barbarian
soldiery
trampling
their
very
soul
the
dreamers
of
palestine
refuse
to
surrender
and
amidst
the
clash
of
guns
and
swords
they
are
battling
for
the
spirit
with
the
weapons
of
the
spirit
the
time
has
not
yet
come
to
write
the
record
of
these
battles
nor
even
to
attempt
to
render
justice
to
the
sublime
heroes
of
palestine
this
book
is
merely
the
story
of
some
of
the
personal
experiences
of
one
who
has
done
less
and
suffered
less
than
thousands
of
his
comrades
alexander
aaronsohn
with
the
turks
in
palestine
chapter
i
years
ago
the
impulse
which
has
since
been
organized
as
the
zionist
movement
led
my
parents
to
leave
their
homes
in
roumania
and
emigrate
to
palestine
where
they
joined
a
number
of
other
jewish
pioneers
in
founding
a
little
village
lying
just
south
of
mount
carmel
in
that
fertile
coastal
region
close
to
the
ancient
plains
of
armageddon
here
i
was
born
my
childhood
was
passed
here
in
the
peace
and
harmony
of
this
little
agricultural
community
with
its
whitewashed
stone
houses
huddled
close
together
for
protection
against
the
native
arabs
who
at
first
menaced
the
life
of
the
new
colony
the
village
was
far
more
suggestive
of
switzerland
than
of
the
conventional
slovenly
villages
of
the
east
and
filthy
for
while
it
was
the
purpose
of
our
people
in
returning
to
the
holy
land
to
foster
the
jewish
language
and
the
social
conditions
of
the
old
testament
as
far
as
possible
there
was
nothing
retrograde
in
this
movement
no
time
was
lost
in
introducing
progressive
methods
of
agriculture
and
the
climatological
experiments
of
other
countries
were
observed
and
made
use
of
in
developing
the
ample
natural
resources
of
the
land
illustration
the
cemetery
of
eucalyptus
imported
from
australia
soon
gave
the
shade
of
its
cool
healthful
foliage
where
previously
no
trees
had
grown
in
the
course
of
time
dry
farming
which
some
people
consider
a
recent
discovery
but
which
in
reality
is
as
old
as
the
old
testament
was
introduced
and
extended
with
american
agricultural
implements
blooded
cattle
were
imported
and
on
a
large
scale
was
undertaken
with
the
aid
of
incubators
to
the
disgust
of
the
arabs
who
look
on
such
usurpation
of
the
hen
functions
as
against
nature
and
sinful
our
people
replaced
the
wretched
native
trails
with
good
roads
bordered
by
hedges
of
thorny
acacia
which
in
season
were
covered
with
downy
little
yellow
blossoms
that
smelled
sweeter
than
honey
when
the
sun
was
on
them
more
important
than
all
these
a
communistic
village
government
was
established
in
which
both
sexes
enjoyed
equal
rights
including
that
of
suffrage
strange
as
this
may
seem
to
persons
who
when
they
think
of
the
matter
at
all
form
vague
conceptions
of
all
the
of
palestine
as
shut
up
in
harems
a
short
experience
with
turkish
courts
and
turkish
justice
taught
our
people
that
they
would
have
to
establish
a
legal
system
of
their
own
two
collaborating
judges
were
therefore
appointed
one
to
interpret
the
mosaic
law
another
to
temper
it
with
modern
jurisprudence
all
jewish
disputes
were
settled
by
this
court
its
effectiveness
may
be
judged
by
the
fact
that
the
arabs
weary
of
turkish
venality
as
open
and
shameless
as
anywhere
in
the
world
began
in
increasing
numbers
to
bring
their
difficulties
to
our
tribunal
jews
are
people
and
life
in
those
palestine
colonies
tended
to
bring
out
the
fraternal
qualities
of
our
race
but
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
over
thirty
years
not
one
jewish
criminal
case
was
reported
from
villages
was
a
little
town
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
fires
so
we
call
it
when
in
on
the
advice
of
my
elder
brother
who
was
head
of
the
jewish
experiment
station
at
athlit
an
ancient
town
of
the
crusaders
i
left
for
america
to
enter
the
service
of
the
united
states
in
the
department
of
agriculture
a
few
days
after
reaching
this
country
i
took
out
my
first
naturalization
papers
and
proceeded
to
washington
where
i
became
part
of
that
great
government
service
whose
beneficent
activity
is
too
little
known
by
americans
here
i
remained
until
june
when
i
returned
to
palestine
with
the
object
of
taking
and
stereopticon
views
these
i
intended
to
use
in
a
lecturing
tour
for
spreading
the
zionist
propaganda
in
the
united
states
during
the
years
of
my
residence
in
america
i
was
able
to
appreciate
and
judge
in
their
right
value
the
beauty
and
inspiration
of
the
life
which
my
people
led
in
the
holy
land
from
a
distance
too
i
saw
better
the
need
for
organization
among
our
communities
and
i
determined
to
build
up
a
fraternal
union
of
the
young
jewish
men
all
over
the
country
two
months
after
my
return
from
america
an
event
occurred
which
gave
impetus
to
these
projects
the
physician
of
our
village
an
old
man
who
had
devoted
his
entire
life
to
serving
and
healing
the
people
of
palestine
without
distinction
of
race
or
religion
was
driving
home
one
evening
in
his
carriage
from
a
neighboring
settlement
with
him
was
a
young
girl
of
sixteen
in
a
deserted
place
they
were
set
upon
by
four
armed
arabs
who
beat
the
old
man
to
unconsciousness
as
he
tried
in
vain
to
defend
the
girl
from
the
terrible
fate
which
awaited
her
night
came
on
alarmed
by
the
absence
of
the
physician
we
young
men
rode
out
in
search
of
him
we
finally
discovered
what
had
happened
and
then
and
there
in
the
serene
moonlight
of
that
eastern
night
with
tragedy
close
at
hand
i
made
my
comrades
take
oath
on
the
honor
of
their
sisters
to
organize
themselves
into
a
strong
society
for
the
defense
of
the
life
and
honor
of
our
villagers
and
of
our
people
at
large
these
details
are
perhaps
useful
for
the
better
understanding
of
the
disturbances
that
came
thick
and
fast
when
in
august
the
broke
out
among
the
nations
of
europe
the
repercussion
was
at
once
felt
even
in
our
remote
corner
of
the
earth
soon
after
the
german
invasion
of
belgium
the
turkish
army
was
mobilized
and
all
citizens
of
the
empire
between
nineteen
and
years
were
called
to
the
colors
as
the
young
turk
constitution
of
provided
that
all
christians
and
jews
were
equally
liable
to
military
service
our
young
men
knew
that
they
too
would
be
called
upon
to
make
the
common
sacrifice
for
the
most
part
they
were
not
unwilling
to
sustain
the
turkish
government
while
the
constitution
imposed
on
them
the
burden
of
militarism
it
had
brought
with
it
the
compensation
of
freedom
of
religion
and
equal
rights
and
we
could
not
forget
that
for
six
hundred
years
turkey
has
held
her
gates
wide
open
to
the
jews
who
fled
from
the
spanish
inquisition
and
similar
ministrations
of
other
civilized
countries
of
course
we
never
dreamed
that
turkey
would
do
anything
but
remain
neutral
if
we
had
had
any
idea
of
the
turn
things
were
ultimately
to
take
we
should
have
given
a
different
greeting
to
the
or
sheriff
who
came
to
our
village
with
the
list
of
mobilizable
men
to
be
called
on
for
service
my
own
position
was
a
curious
one
i
had
every
intention
of
completing
the
process
of
becoming
an
american
citizen
which
i
had
begun
by
taking
out
first
papers
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
however
i
was
still
a
turkish
subject
with
no
claim
to
american
protection
this
was
sneeringly
pointed
out
to
me
by
the
american
consul
at
haifa
who
happens
to
be
a
german
so
there
was
no
other
course
but
to
surrender
myself
to
the
turkish
government
chapter
ii
pressed
into
the
service
there
was
no
question
as
to
my
eligibility
for
service
i
was
young
and
strong
and
healthy
and
even
if
i
had
not
been
the
physical
examination
of
turkish
recruits
is
a
farce
the
enlisting
officers
have
a
theory
of
their
own
that
no
man
is
really
unfit
for
the
army
a
theory
which
has
been
fostered
by
the
ingenious
devices
of
the
arabs
to
avoid
conscription
to
these
wild
people
the
protracted
discipline
of
military
training
is
simply
a
purgatory
and
for
weeks
before
the
recruiting
officers
are
due
they
dose
themselves
with
powerful
herbs
and
physics
and
fast
and
nurse
sores
into
being
until
they
are
in
a
really
deplorable
condition
some
of
them
go
so
far
as
to
cut
off
a
finger
or
two
the
officers
however
have
learned
to
see
beyond
these
little
tricks
and
few
arabs
succeed
in
wriggling
through
their
i
have
watched
dozens
of
arabs
being
brought
in
to
the
recruiting
office
on
camels
or
horses
so
weak
were
they
and
welcomed
into
the
service
with
a
severe
beating
the
sick
and
the
shammers
sharing
the
same
fate
thus
it
often
happens
that
some
of
the
new
recruits
die
after
their
first
day
of
garrison
life
together
with
twenty
of
my
comrades
i
presented
myself
at
the
recruiting
station
at
acco
the
jean
of
history
we
had
been
given
to
understand
that
once
our
names
were
registered
we
should
be
allowed
to
return
home
to
provide
ourselves
with
money
suitable
clothing
and
food
as
well
as
to
bid
our
families
to
our
astonishment
however
we
were
marched
off
to
the
hân
or
caravanserai
and
locked
into
the
great
courtyard
with
hundreds
of
dirty
arabs
hour
after
hour
passed
darkness
came
and
finally
we
had
to
stretch
ourselves
on
the
ground
and
make
the
best
of
a
bad
situation
it
was
a
night
of
horrors
few
of
us
had
closed
an
eye
when
at
dawn
an
officer
appeared
and
ordered
us
out
of
the
hân
from
our
total
number
about
three
hundred
including
four
young
men
from
our
village
and
myself
were
picked
out
and
told
to
make
ready
to
start
at
once
for
saffêd
a
town
in
the
hills
of
northern
galilee
near
the
sea
of
tiberias
where
our
garrison
was
to
be
located
no
attention
was
paid
to
our
requests
that
we
be
allowed
to
return
to
our
homes
for
a
final
visit
that
same
morning
we
were
on
our
way
to
saffêd
a
motley
disgruntled
crew
illustration
saffêd
it
was
a
four
days
march
four
days
of
heat
and
dust
and
physical
suffering
the
september
sun
smote
us
mercilessly
as
we
straggled
along
the
miserable
native
trail
full
of
gullies
and
loose
stones
it
would
not
have
been
so
bad
if
we
had
been
adequately
shod
or
clothed
but
soon
we
found
ourselves
envying
the
ragged
arabs
as
they
trudged
along
barefoot
paying
no
heed
to
the
jagged
flints
shoes
to
the
arab
are
articles
for
ceremonious
indoor
use
when
any
serious
walking
is
to
be
done
he
takes
them
off
slings
them
over
his
shoulder
and
trusts
to
the
horny
soles
of
his
feet
to
add
to
our
troubles
the
turkish
officers
with
characteristic
fatalism
had
made
no
commissary
provision
for
us
whatever
any
food
we
ate
had
to
be
purchased
by
the
roadside
from
our
own
funds
which
were
scant
enough
to
start
with
the
arabs
were
in
a
terrible
plight
most
of
them
were
penniless
and
as
the
pangs
of
hunger
set
in
they
began
pillaging
right
and
left
from
the
little
farms
by
the
wayside
from
modest
beginnings
poultry
and
vegetables
they
progressed
to
larger
game
unhindered
by
the
officers
houses
were
entered
women
insulted
time
and
again
i
saw
a
stray
horse
grazing
by
the
roadside
seized
by
a
crowd
of
grinning
arabs
who
piled
on
the
poor
beast
back
until
he
was
almost
crushed
to
earth
and
rode
off
triumphantly
while
their
comrades
held
back
the
weeping
owner
the
result
of
this
sort
of
requisitioning
was
that
our
band
of
recruits
was
followed
by
an
increasing
throng
of
farmers
imploring
threatening
trying
by
hook
or
by
crook
to
win
back
the
stolen
goods
little
satisfaction
did
they
get
although
some
of
them
went
with
us
as
far
as
saffêd
our
garrison
town
is
not
an
inviting
place
nor
has
it
an
inviting
reputation
lord
kitchener
himself
had
good
reason
to
remember
it
as
a
young
lieutenant
of
in
the
royal
engineering
corps
he
was
nearly
killed
there
by
a
band
of
fanatical
arabs
while
surveying
for
the
palestine
exploration
fund
kitchener
had
a
narrow
escape
of
it
one
of
his
fellow
officers
was
shot
dead
close
by
him
but
he
went
calmly
ahead
and
completed
his
maps
splendid
affairs
which
have
never
since
been
equaled
and
which
are
now
in
use
by
the
turkish
and
german
armies
however
though
saffêd
combines
most
of
the
unpleasant
characteristics
of
palestine
native
towns
we
welcomed
the
sight
of
it
for
we
were
used
up
by
the
march
an
old
deserted
mosque
was
given
us
for
barracks
there
on
the
bare
stone
floor
in
promiscuity
too
tired
to
react
to
filth
and
vermin
we
spent
our
first
night
as
soldiers
of
the
sultan
while
the
milky
moonlight
streamed
in
through
every
chink
and
aperture
and
bats
flitted
round
the
vaulting
above
the
snoring
carcasses
of
the
recruits
next
morning
we
were
routed
out
at
five
the
black
depths
of
the
well
in
the
center
of
the
mosque
courtyard
provided
doubtful
water
for
washing
bathing
and
drinking
then
came
breakfast
our
first
government
meal
consisting
simply
enough
of
boiled
rice
which
was
ladled
out
into
tin
holding
rations
for
ten
men
in
true
eastern
fashion
we
squatted
down
round
the
basin
and
dug
into
the
rice
with
our
fingers
at
first
i
was
rather
upset
by
this
sort
of
table
manners
and
for
some
time
i
ate
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
my
own
portion
to
avoid
seeing
the
arabs
who
fill
the
palms
of
their
hands
with
rice
pat
it
into
a
ball
and
cram
it
into
their
mouths
just
so
the
bolus
making
a
great
lump
in
their
lean
throats
as
it
reluctantly
descends
in
the
course
of
that
same
morning
we
were
allotted
our
uniforms
the
turkish
uniform
under
indirect
german
influence
has
been
greatly
modified
during
the
past
five
years
it
is
of
khaki
a
greener
khaki
than
that
of
the
british
army
and
of
conventional
european
cut
spiral
puttees
and
good
boots
are
provided
the
only
peculiar
feature
is
the
headgear
a
curious
combination
of
the
turban
and
the
german
helmet
devised
by
enver
pasha
to
combine
religion
and
practicality
and
called
in
his
honor
with
commendable
thrift
enver
patented
his
invention
and
it
is
rumored
that
he
has
drawn
a
comfortable
fortune
from
its
sale
an
excellent
uniform
it
is
on
the
whole
but
to
our
disgust
we
found
that
in
the
great
pile
to
which
we
were
led
there
was
not
a
single
new
one
all
were
old
discarded
and
dirty
and
the
mere
thought
of
putting
on
the
clothes
of
some
unknown
arab
legionary
who
perhaps
had
died
of
cholera
at
mecca
or
yemen
made
me
shudder
after
some
indecision
my
friends
and
i
finally
went
up
to
one
of
the
officers
and
offered
to
new
uniforms
with
the
money
we
expected
daily
from
our
families
the
officer
scenting
the
chance
for
a
little
private
profit
gave
his
consent
the
days
and
weeks
following
were
busy
ones
from
morning
till
night
it
was
drill
drill
and
again
drill
we
were
divided
into
groups
of
fifty
each
of
which
was
put
in
charge
of
a
young
officer
from
the
military
school
of
constantinople
or
damascus
or
of
some
arab
who
had
seen
several
years
service
these
instructors
had
a
hard
time
of
it
the
german
military
system
which
had
only
recently
been
introduced
was
too
much
for
them
they
kept
mixing
up
the
old
and
the
new
methods
of
training
with
the
result
that
it
was
often
hopeless
to
try
and
make
out
their
orders
whole
weeks
were
spent
in
grinding
into
the
arabs
the
names
of
the
different
parts
of
the
rifle
weeks
more
went
to
teaching
them
to
clean
it
although
it
must
be
said
that
once
they
had
mastered
these
technicalities
they
were
excellent
shots
their
efficiency
would
have
been
considerably
greater
if
there
had
been
more
from
the
very
first
however
we
felt
that
there
was
a
scarcity
of
ammunition
this
shortage
the
in
a
spirit
of
compensation
attempted
to
make
up
by
abundant
severity
the
whip
of
soft
flexible
stinging
leather
which
seldom
leaves
the
turkish
officer
hand
was
never
idle
this
was
not
surprising
for
the
arab
is
a
cunning
fellow
whose
only
respect
is
for
brute
force
he
exercises
it
himself
on
every
possible
victim
and
expects
the
same
treatment
from
his
superiors
so
far
as
my
comrades
and
i
were
concerned
i
must
admit
that
we
were
generally
treated
kindly
we
knew
most
of
the
from
the
gymnastic
training
we
had
practiced
since
childhood
and
the
officers
realized
that
we
were
educated
and
came
from
respectable
families
the
same
was
also
true
with
regard
to
the
native
christians
most
of
whom
can
read
and
write
and
are
of
a
better
class
than
the
mohammedans
of
the
country
when
turkey
threw
in
her
lot
with
the
germanic
powers
the
attitude
toward
the
jews
and
christians
changed
radically
but
of
this
i
shall
speak
later
it
was
a
hard
life
we
led
while
in
training
at
saffêd
evening
would
find
us
dead
tired
and
little
disposed
for
anything
but
rest
as
the
tremendous
of
the
eastern
sunsets
faded
away
we
would
gather
in
little
groups
in
the
courtyard
of
our
mosque
its
minaret
towering
black
against
a
turquoise
sky
and
talk
fitfully
of
the
little
happenings
of
the
day
while
the
arabs
murmured
gutturally
around
us
occasionally
one
of
them
would
burst
into
a
quavering
tribal
it
happened
that
i
was
fairly
well
known
among
these
natives
through
my
horse
kochba
of
pure
blood
which
i
had
purchased
from
some
anazzi
bedouins
who
were
encamped
not
far
from
aleppo
a
swift
and
intelligent
animal
he
was
winner
of
many
races
and
in
a
land
where
a
horse
is
considerably
more
valuable
than
a
wife
his
ownership
cast
quite
a
glamour
over
me
illustration
the
author
on
his
horse
kochba
in
the
evenings
then
the
arabs
would
come
up
to
chat
as
they
speak
seldom
of
their
children
of
their
never
the
conversation
was
limited
to
generalities
about
the
crops
and
the
weather
or
to
the
recitation
of
tales
of
the
famous
hero
of
the
or
of
antar
the
glorious
politics
of
which
they
have
amazing
ideas
also
came
in
for
discussion
napoleon
bonaparte
and
queen
victoria
are
still
living
figures
to
them
but
significantly
enough
they
considered
the
kaiser
king
of
all
the
kings
of
this
world
with
the
exception
of
the
sultan
whom
they
admitted
to
equality
seldom
did
an
evening
pass
without
a
dance
as
darkness
fell
the
arabs
would
gather
in
a
great
circle
around
one
of
their
comrades
who
squatted
on
the
ground
with
a
bamboo
flute
to
a
weird
minor
music
they
would
begin
swaying
and
moving
about
while
some
poet
among
them
would
sing
impromptu
verses
to
the
flute
as
a
rule
the
themes
were
homely
we
shall
eat
rice
and
meat
the
singer
would
wail
my
endeavor
be
granted
came
the
response
of
all
the
others
the
chorus
was
tremendously
effective
sometimes
the
singer
would
indulge
in
pointed
personalities
with
answering
roars
of
laughter
these
dances
lasted
for
hours
and
as
they
progressed
the
men
gradually
worked
themselves
up
into
a
frenzy
i
never
failed
to
wonder
at
these
people
who
without
the
aid
of
alcohol
could
reproduce
the
various
stages
of
intoxication
as
i
lay
by
and
watched
the
moon
riding
serenely
above
these
frantic
men
and
their
twisting
black
shadows
i
reflected
that
they
were
just
in
the
condition
when
one
word
from
a
holy
man
would
suffice
to
send
them
off
to
wholesale
murder
and
rapine
it
was
my
good
fortune
soon
to
be
released
from
the
noise
and
dirt
of
the
mosque
i
had
had
experience
with
corruptible
turkish
officers
and
one
day
when
barrack
conditions
became
unendurable
i
went
to
the
officer
commanding
our
division
an
old
arab
from
latakieh
who
had
been
called
from
retirement
at
the
time
of
the
mobilization
he
lived
in
a
little
tent
near
the
mosque
where
i
found
him
squatting
on
the
floor
nodding
drowsily
over
his
comfortable
paunch
as
he
was
an
officer
of
the
old
régime
i
entered
boldly
squatted
beside
him
and
told
him
my
troubles
the
answer
came
with
an
enormous
shrug
of
the
shoulders
you
are
serving
the
sultan
hardship
should
be
sweet
i
should
be
more
fit
to
serve
him
if
i
got
more
sleep
and
rest
he
waved
a
fat
hand
about
the
tent
look
at
me
here
i
am
an
officer
of
rank
and
shooting
a
knowing
look
at
me
i
have
not
even
a
nice
blanket
a
crime
a
crime
i
interrupted
to
think
of
it
when
i
a
humble
soldier
have
dozens
of
them
at
home
i
should
be
honored
if
you
would
allow
me
my
voice
trailed
off
suggestively
how
could
you
get
one
he
asked
oh
i
have
friends
here
in
saffêd
but
i
be
able
to
sleep
in
a
nice
place
of
course
certainly
what
would
you
suggest
that
hotel
kept
by
the
jewish
widow
might
do
i
replied
more
amenities
were
exchanged
the
upshot
of
which
was
that
my
four
friends
and
i
were
given
permission
to
sleep
at
the
inn
a
humble
place
but
infinitely
better
than
the
mosque
it
was
all
perfectly
simple

chapter
iii
the
german
propaganda
so
passed
the
days
of
our
training
swiftly
monotonously
until
the
fateful
december
morning
when
the
news
came
like
a
thunderbolt
that
turkey
was
about
to
join
hands
with
germany
we
had
had
reports
of
the
war
of
a
kind
copies
of
telegrams
from
constantinople
printed
in
arabic
were
circulated
among
us
giving
accounts
of
endless
german
victories
these
however
we
had
laughed
at
as
fabrications
of
a
prussophile
press
agency
and
in
our
skepticism
we
had
failed
to
give
the
teutons
credit
for
the
successes
they
had
actually
won
to
us
born
and
bred
in
the
east
as
we
were
the
success
of
german
propaganda
in
the
turkish
empire
could
not
come
as
an
overwhelming
surprise
but
its
fullness
amazed
us
it
may
be
of
timely
interest
to
say
a
few
words
here
regarding
this
propaganda
as
i
have
seen
it
in
palestine
spreading
under
strong
and
efficient
organization
for
twenty
years
in
order
to
realize
her
imperialistic
dreams
germany
absolutely
needed
palestine
it
was
the
key
to
the
whole
oriental
situation
no
mere
coincidence
brought
the
kaiser
to
damascus
in
november
the
same
month
that
kitchener
in
london
was
hailed
as
gordon
avenger
when
he
uttered
his
famous
phrase
at
the
tomb
of
saladin
tell
the
three
hundred
million
moslems
of
the
world
that
i
am
their
friend
we
have
all
seen
photographs
of
the
imperial
figure
draped
in
an
amazing
burnous
of
his
own
designing
above
which
the
prussian
rises
supreme
as
he
moved
from
point
to
point
in
this
portentous
visit
we
may
also
have
seen
caran
celebrated
cartoon
a
subject
of
diplomatic
correspondence
representing
this
same
imperial
figure
in
its
oriental
toggery
riding
into
jerusalem
on
an
ass
the
nations
of
europe
laughed
at
this
visit
and
its
transparent
purpose
but
it
was
all
part
of
the
scheme
which
won
for
the
germans
the
concessions
for
the
railway
and
made
them
owners
of
the
double
valley
of
the
euphrates
and
tigris
through
branch
lines
projected
through
the
firman
they
are
practically
in
control
of
both
the
syrian
routes
toward
the
cypriotic
mediterranean
and
the
lebanon
valleys
they
also
control
the
three
armenian
routes
of
cappadocia
the
black
sea
and
the
branch
of
urfa
marach
and
mardine
the
fall
of
erzerum
has
altered
conditions
respecting
this
last
they
dominate
the
persian
routes
toward
tauris
and
teheran
as
well
and
last
but
not
least
the
gulf
branch
of
zobeir
these
railways
delivered
into
german
hands
the
control
of
persia
whence
the
road
to
india
may
be
made
easy
through
syria
lies
the
route
to
the
suez
canal
and
egypt
which
was
used
in
february
and
will
probably
be
used
again
this
year
to
make
this
oriental
dream
a
reality
the
germans
have
not
relied
on
their
railway
concessions
alone
their
government
has
done
everything
in
its
power
to
encourage
german
colonization
in
palestine
scattered
all
over
the
country
are
german
mills
that
half
of
the
time
have
nothing
to
grind
german
hotels
have
been
opened
in
places
seldom
frequented
by
tourists
german
engineers
appeared
in
force
surveying
sounding
noting
all
these
colonists
held
gatherings
in
the
arab
villages
when
the
ignorant
natives
were
told
of
the
greatness
of
germany
of
her
good
intentions
and
of
the
evil
machinations
of
other
powers
what
i
state
here
can
be
corroborated
by
any
one
who
knows
palestine
and
has
lived
in
it
about
the
time
when
we
first
knew
that
turkey
would
join
the
germanic
powers
came
the
news
that
the
capitulations
had
been
revoked
as
is
generally
known
foreigners
formerly
enjoyed
the
protection
of
their
respective
consuls
the
turkish
government
under
the
terms
of
the
capitulations
or
agreements
had
no
jurisdiction
over
an
american
for
instance
or
a
frenchman
who
could
not
be
arrested
without
the
consent
of
his
consul
in
the
ottoman
empire
where
law
and
justice
are
not
at
a
premium
such
protection
was
a
wholesome
and
necessary
policy
the
revoking
of
the
capitulations
was
a
terrible
blow
to
all
the
europeans
meaning
as
it
did
the
practical
abolition
of
all
their
rights
upon
the
arabs
it
acted
like
an
intoxicant
every
or
boatman
felt
that
he
was
the
equal
of
the
accursed
frank
who
now
had
no
consul
to
protect
him
and
abuses
began
immediately
moreover
as
if
by
magic
the
whole
country
became
germanized
in
all
the
mosques
friday
prayers
were
ended
with
an
invocation
for
the
welfare
of
the
sultan
and
hadji
wilhelm
the
significance
of
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
title
hadji
can
be
properly
applied
only
to
a
moslem
who
has
made
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
and
kissed
the
sacred
stone
of
the
kaaba
instant
death
is
the
penalty
paid
by
any
christian
who
is
found
within
that
enclosure
yet
wilhelm
ii
head
of
the
lutheran
faith
stepped
forward
as
hadji
wilhelm
his
pictures
were
sold
everywhere
german
officers
appeared
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
wind
of
brutal
mastery
were
blowing
the
dominant
figure
of
this
movement
in
palestine
was
without
doubt
the
german
consul
at
haifa
leutweld
von
hardegg
he
traveled
about
the
country
making
speeches
and
distributing
pamphlets
in
arabic
in
which
it
was
elaborately
proved
that
germans
are
not
christians
like
the
french
or
english
but
that
they
are
descendants
of
the
prophet
mohammed
passages
from
the
koran
were
quoted
prophesying
the
coming
of
the
kaiser
as
the
savior
of
islam
chapter
iv
and
discharge
the
news
of
the
actual
declaration
of
war
by
turkey
caused
a
tremendous
stir
in
our
regiment
the
prevailing
feeling
was
one
of
great
restlessness
and
discontent
the
arabs
made
many
bitter
remarks
against
germany
why
did
she
help
us
against
the
italians
during
the
war
for
tripoli
they
said
now
that
she
is
in
trouble
she
is
drawing
us
into
the
fight
their
opinions
however
soon
underwent
a
change
in
the
first
place
they
came
to
realize
that
turkey
had
taken
up
arms
against
russia
and
russia
is
considered
first
and
foremost
the
german
reports
of
german
successes
also
had
a
powerful
effect
on
them
they
began
to
grow
boastful
arrogant
and
the
sight
of
the
plundering
of
europeans
jews
and
christians
convinced
them
that
a
very
desirable
régime
was
setting
in
saffêd
has
a
large
jewish
colony
and
it
was
torment
for
me
to
have
to
witness
the
outrages
that
my
people
suffered
in
the
name
of
requisitioning
the
final
blow
came
one
morning
when
all
the
jewish
and
christian
soldiers
of
our
regiment
were
called
out
and
told
that
henceforth
they
were
to
serve
in
the
or
working
corps
the
object
of
this
action
plainly
enough
was
to
conciliate
and
flatter
the
mohammedan
population
and
at
the
same
time
to
put
the
jews
and
christians
who
for
the
most
part
favored
the
cause
of
the
allies
in
a
position
where
they
would
be
least
dangerous
we
were
disarmed
our
uniforms
were
taken
away
and
we
became
gangsters
i
shall
never
forget
the
humiliation
of
that
day
when
we
who
after
all
were
the
troops
of
the
lot
were
first
herded
to
our
work
of
pushing
wheelbarrows
and
handling
spades
by
grinning
arabs
rifle
on
shoulder
we
were
set
to
building
the
road
between
saffêd
and
tiberias
on
the
sea
of
galilee
a
link
in
the
military
highway
from
damascus
to
the
coast
which
would
be
used
for
the
movement
of
troops
in
case
the
railroad
should
be
cut
off
it
had
no
immediate
strategic
bearing
on
the
attack
against
suez
however
from
six
in
the
morning
till
seven
at
night
we
were
hard
at
it
except
for
one
hour
rest
at
noon
while
we
had
money
it
was
possible
to
get
some
slight
relief
by
bribing
our
taskmasters
but
this
soon
came
to
an
end
and
we
had
to
endure
their
brutality
as
best
we
could
the
wheelbarrows
we
used
were
the
property
of
a
french
company
which
before
the
war
was
undertaking
a
highway
to
beirut
no
grease
was
provided
for
the
wheels
so
that
there
was
a
maddening
squeaking
and
squealing
in
addition
to
the
difficulty
of
pushing
the
barrows
one
day
i
suggested
to
an
inspection
officer
that
if
the
wheels
were
not
greased
the
axles
would
be
burned
out
he
agreed
with
me
and
issued
an
order
that
the
men
were
to
provide
their
own
oil
to
lubricate
the
wheels
i
shall
not
dwell
on
the
physical
sufferings
we
underwent
while
working
on
this
road
for
the
reason
that
the
conditions
i
have
described
were
prevalent
over
the
whole
country
and
later
when
i
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
some
construction
camps
in
samaria
and
judaea
found
that
in
comparison
our
lot
had
been
a
happy
one
while
we
were
breaking
stones
and
trundling
squeaking
wheelbarrows
however
the
most
disquieting
rumors
began
to
drift
in
to
us
from
our
home
villages
plundering
had
been
going
on
in
the
name
of
requisitioning
the
country
was
full
of
soldiery
whose
capacity
for
was
well
known
to
us
and
it
was
torture
to
think
of
what
might
be
happening
in
our
peaceful
homes
where
so
few
men
had
been
left
for
protection
all
the
fences
we
heard
had
been
torn
up
and
sent
north
for
the
construction
of
barricades
in
a
wild
land
like
palestine
where
the
native
has
no
respect
for
property
where
fields
and
crops
are
always
at
the
mercy
of
marauders
the
fence
has
been
a
tremendous
factor
for
civilization
and
with
these
gone
the
arabs
were
once
more
free
to
sweep
across
the
country
unhindered
stealing
and
destroying
the
situation
grew
more
and
more
unbearable
one
day
a
little
christian
soldier
a
nazarene
disappeared
from
the
ranks
we
never
saw
him
again
but
we
learned
that
his
sister
a
very
young
girl
had
been
forcibly
taken
by
a
turkish
officer
of
the
nazareth
garrison
in
palestine
the
dishonor
of
a
girl
can
be
redeemed
by
blood
alone
the
young
soldier
had
hunted
for
his
sister
found
her
in
the
barracks
and
shot
her
he
then
surrendered
himself
to
the
military
authorities
who
undoubtedly
put
him
to
death
he
had
not
dared
to
kill
the
real
criminal
the
officer
for
he
knew
that
this
would
not
only
bring
death
to
his
family
but
would
call
down
terrible
suffering
on
all
the
christians
of
nazareth
illustration
nazareth
from
the
northeast
when
i
learned
of
this
tragedy
i
determined
to
get
out
of
the
army
and
return
to
my
village
at
all
costs
nine
turkish
officers
out
of
ten
can
be
bought
and
i
had
reason
to
know
that
the
officer
in
command
at
saffêd
was
not
that
tenth
man
now
according
to
the
law
of
the
country
a
man
has
the
right
to
purchase
exemption
from
military
service
for
a
sum
equivalent
to
two
hundred
dollars
my
case
was
different
for
i
was
already
enrolled
but
everything
is
possible
in
turkey
i
set
to
work
and
in
less
than
two
weeks
i
had
bought
half
a
dozen
officers
ranging
from
corporal
to
captain
and
had
obtained
consent
of
the
higher
authorities
to
my
departure
provided
i
could
get
a
certificate
declaring
me
unfit
for
service
this
was
arranged
in
short
order
although
i
am
and
the
doctor
found
some
difficulty
in
hitting
on
an
appropriate
ailment
finally
he
decided
that
i
had
too
much
blood
whatever
that
might
mean
with
his
certificate
in
hand
i
paid
the
regular
price
of
two
hundred
dollars
from
funds
which
had
been
sent
me
by
my
family
and
walked
out
of
the
barracks
a
free
man
my
happiness
was
mingled
with
sadness
at
the
thought
of
leaving
the
comrades
with
whom
i
had
suffered
and
hoped
the
four
boys
from
my
village
were
splendid
they
felt
that
i
was
right
in
going
home
to
do
what
i
could
for
the
people
but
when
they
kissed
me
in
the
eastern
fashion
the
tears
were
running
down
their
cheeks
and
they
were
all
strong
brave
fellows
on
my
way
back
to
i
passed
through
the
town
of
where
i
got
a
foretaste
of
the
conditions
i
was
to
find
at
home
a
turkish
soldier
sauntering
along
the
street
helped
himself
to
fruit
from
the
basket
of
an
old
vender
and
went
on
without
offering
to
pay
a
farthing
when
the
old
man
ventured
to
protest
the
soldier
turned
like
a
flash
and
began
beating
him
mercilessly
knocking
him
down
and
battering
him
until
he
was
bruised
bleeding
and
covered
with
the
mud
of
the
street
there
was
a
hubbub
a
crowd
formed
through
which
a
turkish
officer
forced
his
way
demanding
explanations
the
soldier
sketched
the
situation
in
a
few
words
whereupon
the
officer
turning
to
the
old
man
said
impressively
if
a
soldier
of
the
sultan
should
choose
to
heap
filth
on
your
head
it
is
for
you
to
kiss
his
hand
in
gratitude
chapter
v
the
hidden
arms
when
i
finally
reached
i
found
rather
a
sad
state
of
affairs
military
law
had
been
declared
no
one
was
supposed
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
after
sundown
the
village
was
full
of
soldiers
and
civilians
had
to
put
up
with
all
kinds
of
moreover
our
people
were
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
because
an
order
had
recently
come
from
the
turkish
authorities
bidding
them
surrender
whatever
or
weapons
they
had
in
their
possession
a
sinister
command
this
we
knew
that
similar
measures
had
been
taken
before
the
terrible
armenian
massacres
and
we
felt
that
some
such
fate
might
be
in
preparation
for
our
people
with
the
arms
gone
the
head
men
of
the
village
knew
that
our
last
hold
over
the
arabs
our
last
chance
for
defense
against
sudden
violence
would
be
gone
and
they
had
refused
to
give
them
up
a
search
had
been
made
fruitlessly
for
our
little
arsenal
was
safely
cached
in
a
field
beneath
growing
grain
it
was
a
tense
unpleasant
situation
at
any
time
the
turks
might
decide
to
back
up
their
demand
by
some
of
the
violent
methods
of
which
they
are
past
masters
a
family
council
was
held
in
my
home
and
it
was
decided
to
send
my
sister
a
girl
of
to
some
friends
at
the
american
syrian
protestant
college
at
beirut
so
that
we
might
be
able
to
move
freely
without
the
responsibility
of
having
a
girl
at
home
in
a
country
where
as
a
matter
of
course
the
are
seized
and
carried
off
before
a
massacre
at
beirut
we
knew
that
there
was
an
american
who
kept
in
continual
touch
with
the
battleship
anchored
in
the
harbor
for
the
protection
of
american
interests
my
sister
got
away
none
too
soon
one
evening
shortly
after
her
departure
when
i
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
our
house
watching
the
ever
fresh
miracle
of
the
eastern
sunset
a
turkish
officer
came
riding
down
the
street
with
about
thirty
cavalrymen
he
called
me
out
and
ordered
me
to
follow
him
to
the
little
village
inn
where
he
dismounted
and
led
me
to
one
of
the
inner
rooms
his
spurs
jingling
loudly
as
we
passed
along
the
stone
corridor
i
never
knew
whether
i
had
been
selected
for
this
attention
because
of
my
prominence
as
a
leader
of
the
jewish
young
men
or
simply
because
i
had
been
standing
conveniently
in
the
doorway
the
officer
closed
the
door
and
came
straight
to
the
point
by
asking
me
where
our
store
of
arms
was
hidden
he
was
a
big
fellow
with
the
handsome
cruel
features
usual
enough
in
his
class
there
was
no
open
menace
in
his
first
question
when
i
refused
to
tell
him
he
began
wheedling
and
offering
all
sorts
of
favors
if
i
would
betray
my
people
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
whipped
out
a
revolver
and
stuck
the
muzzle
right
in
my
face
i
felt
the
blood
leave
my
heart
but
i
was
able
to
control
myself
and
refuse
his
demand
the
officer
was
not
easily
discouraged
the
hours
i
passed
in
that
little
room
with
its
smoky
kerosene
lamp
were
terrible
ones
i
realized
however
how
tremendously
important
the
question
of
the
arms
was
and
strength
was
given
me
to
hold
out
until
the
officer
gave
up
in
disgust
and
let
me
go
home
illustration

of
the
author

ephraim
fishl
aaronsohn
in
my
father
an
old
man
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
but
the
rest
of
my
family
were
tremendously
excited
i
made
light
of
the
whole
affair
but
i
felt
sure
that
this
was
only
the
beginning
sure
enough
next
morning
the
sabbath
the
same
officer
returned
and
put
three
of
the
leading
elders
of
the
village
together
with
myself
under
arrest
after
another
fruitless
inquisition
at
the
hotel
we
were
handcuffed
and
started
on
foot
toward
the
prison
a
day
journey
away
as
our
little
procession
passed
my
home
my
father
who
was
aged
and
feeble
came
tottering
forward
to
say
to
me
a
soldier
pushed
him
roughly
back
he
reeled
then
fell
in
the
street
before
my
eyes
it
was
a
dismal
departure
we
were
driven
through
the
streets
shackled
like
criminals
and
the
women
and
children
came
out
of
the
houses
and
watched
us
in
silence
their
heads
bowed
tears
running
down
their
cheeks
they
realized
that
for
years
these
old
men
my
comrades
had
been
struggling
and
suffering
for
their
ideal
a
regenerated
palestine
now
in
the
dusk
of
their
life
it
seemed
as
if
all
their
hopes
and
dreams
were
coming
to
ruin
the
oppressive
tragedy
of
the
situation
settled
down
on
me
more
and
more
heavily
as
the
day
wore
on
and
heat
and
fatigue
told
on
my
companions
my
feelings
must
have
been
written
large
on
my
face
for
one
of
them
a
patriarch
tried
to
give
me
comfort
by
reminding
me
that
we
must
not
rely
upon
strength
of
arms
and
that
our
spirit
could
never
be
broken
no
matter
how
defenseless
we
were
thus
he
an
old
man
was
encouraging
me
instead
of
receiving
help
from
my
youth
and
enthusiasm
at
last
we
arrived
at
the
prison
and
were
locked
into
separate
cells
that
same
night
we
were
tortured
with
the
or
bastinado
the
victim
of
this
horrible
punishment
is
trussed
up
arms
and
legs
and
thrown
on
his
knees
then
on
the
bare
soles
of
his
feet
a
pliant
green
rod
is
brought
down
with
all
the
force
of
a
soldier
arm
the
pain
is
exquisite
blood
leaps
out
at
the
first
cut
and
strong
men
usually
faint
after
thirty
or
forty
strokes
strange
to
say
the
worst
part
of
it
is
not
the
blow
itself
but
the
whistling
of
the
rod
through
the
air
as
it
rushes
to
its
mark
the
groans
of
my
older
comrades
whose
gasps
and
prayers
i
could
hear
through
the
walls
of
the
cell
helped
me
bear
the
agony
until
unconsciousness
mercifully
came
to
the
rescue
for
several
days
more
we
were
kept
in
the
prison
sick
and
broken
with
suffering
the
second
night
as
i
lay
sleepless
and
desperate
on
the
strip
of
dirty
matting
that
served
as
bed
i
heard
a
at
the
grated
slit
of
a
window
and
presently
a
slender
stick
was
inserted
into
the
cell
i
went
over
and
shook
it
some
one
at
the
other
end
was
holding
it
firm
and
then
a
curious
whispering
sound
began
to
come
from
the
end
of
the
stick
i
put
my
ear
down
and
caught
the
voice
of
one
of
the
men
from
our
village
he
had
taken
a
long
bamboo
pole
pierced
the
joints
and
crept
up
behind
a
broken
old
wall
close
beneath
my
window
by
means
of
this
primitive
telephone
we
talked
as
long
as
we
dared
i
assured
him
that
we
were
still
enduring
and
urged
him
on
no
account
to
give
up
the
arms
to
the
turkish
authorities
not
even
if
we
had
to
make
the
ultimate
sacrifice
finally
when
it
was
found
that
torture
and
imprisonment
would
not
make
us
yield
our
secret
the
turks
resorted
to
the
final
test
the
ordeal
which
we
could
not
withstand
they
announced
that
on
a
certain
date
a
number
of
our
young
girls
would
be
carried
off
and
handed
over
to
the
officers
to
be
kept
until
the
arms
were
disclosed
we
knew
that
they
were
capable
of
carrying
out
this
threat
we
knew
exactly
what
it
meant
there
was
no
alternative
the
people
of
our
village
had
nothing
to
do
but
dig
up
the
treasured
arms
and
with
broken
hearts
hand
them
over
to
the
authorities
and
so
the
terrible
news
was
brought
to
us
one
morning
that
we
were
free
personally
i
felt
much
happier
on
the
day
i
was
put
in
prison
than
when
i
was
released
i
had
often
wondered
how
our
people
had
been
able
to
bear
the
rack
and
thumbscrew
of
the
spanish
inquisition
but
when
my
turn
and
my
comrades
came
for
torture
i
realized
that
the
same
spirit
that
helped
our
ancestors
was
working
in
us
also
now
i
knew
that
our
suffering
had
been
useless
whenever
the
turkish
authorities
wished
the
horrors
of
the
armenian
massacres
would
live
again
in
and
we
should
be
powerless
to
raise
a
hand
to
protect
ourselves
as
we
came
limping
home
through
the
streets
of
our
village
i
caught
sight
of
my
own
smith
wesson
revolver
in
the
hands
of
a
mere
boy
of
fifteen
the
son
of
a
arab
outlaw
i
realized
then
that
the
turks
had
not
only
taken
our
weapons
but
had
distributed
them
among
the
natives
in
order
to
complete
our
humiliation
the
blood
rushed
to
my
face
i
started
forward
to
take
the
revolver
away
from
the
boy
but
one
of
the
old
men
caught
hold
of
my
sleeve
and
held
me
back
illustration
in
a
native

chapter
vi
the
suez
campaign
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
requisitioning
that
took
place
among
our
people
while
i
was
working
at
saffêd
this
of
course
really
amounted
to
wholesale
pillage
the
hand
of
the
turkish
looters
had
fallen
particularly
heavy
on
carts
and
draught
animals
as
the
arabs
know
little
or
nothing
of
carting
hauling
or
the
management
of
horses
and
mules
the
turks
simply
enough
had
requisitioned
many
of
the
owners
or
elderly
men
and
forced
them
to
go
south
to
help
along
with
the
tremendous
preparations
that
were
being
made
for
the
attack
on
suez
among
these
were
a
number
of
men
from
our
village
in
the
course
of
time
their
families
began
to
get
the
most
harrowing
messages
from
them
they
were
absolutely
destitute
no
wages
being
paid
them
by
the
turks
their
clothes
were
dropping
off
them
in
rags
many
were
sick
after
much
excited
planning
it
was
decided
to
send
another
man
and
myself
down
south
on
a
sort
of
relief
expedition
with
a
substantial
sum
of
money
that
had
been
raised
with
great
difficulty
by
our
people
through
the
influence
of
my
brother
at
the
agricultural
experiment
station
i
got
permission
from
the
to
leave
and
about
the
middle
of
january
i
set
out
for
jerusalem
to
western
minds
the
idea
of
the
holy
city
serving
as
a
base
for
modern
military
operations
must
be
full
of
incongruities
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
an
amazing
sight
to
see
the
streets
packed
with
soldiers
and
hear
the
brooding
silence
of
ancient
walls
shattered
by
the
crash
of
army
boots
here
for
the
first
time
i
saw
the
german
officers
quantities
of
them
strangely
out
of
place
they
looked
with
their
that
no
amount
of
hot
sunshine
could
quite
burn
off
they
wore
the
regular
german
uniform
except
that
the
was
replaced
by
a
khaki
i
was
struck
by
the
youthfulness
of
them
many
were
nothing
but
boys
and
there
were
weak
dissolute
faces
in
plenty
a
fact
that
was
later
explained
when
i
heard
that
palestine
had
been
the
for
young
men
of
high
family
whose
parents
were
anxious
to
have
them
as
far
removed
as
possible
from
the
danger
zone
hotel
was
the
great
in
jerusalem
for
these
young
bloods
every
evening
thirty
or
forty
would
foregather
there
to
drink
and
talk
women
and
strategy
i
well
remember
the
evening
when
one
of
them
a
slender
young
prussian
with
no
back
to
his
head
braceleted
and
monocled
rose
and
announced
in
the
decisive
tones
that
go
with
a
certain
stage
of
intoxication
what
we
ought
to
do
is
to
hand
over
the
organization
of
this
campaign
to
thomas
cook
sons
however
the
german
officers
were
by
no
means
all
incompetents
they
realized
i
soon
found
out
that
they
had
little
hope
of
bringing
a
big
army
through
the
egyptian
desert
and
making
a
successful
campaign
there
their
object
was
to
immobilize
a
great
force
of
british
troops
around
the
canal
to
keep
the
mohammedan
population
in
palestine
impressed
with
turkish
power
and
to
stir
up
religious
unrest
among
the
natives
in
egypt
it
must
be
admitted
that
in
the
first
two
of
these
purposes
they
have
been
successful
the
turks
were
less
they
believed
firmly
that
they
were
going
to
sweep
the
english
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
enter
cairo
in
triumph
and
preparations
for
the
march
on
suez
went
on
with
feverish
enthusiasm
the
ideas
of
the
common
soldiers
on
this
subject
were
amusing
some
of
them
declared
that
the
canal
was
to
be
filled
up
by
the
sandbags
which
had
been
prepared
in
great
quantities
others
held
that
thousands
of
camels
would
be
kept
without
water
for
many
days
preceding
the
attack
then
the
thirsty
animals
when
released
would
rush
into
the
canal
in
such
numbers
that
the
troops
could
march
to
victory
over
the
packed
masses
of
drowned
bodies
the
army
operating
against
suez
numbered
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
of
these
about
twenty
thousand
were
anatolian
turks
trained
soldiers
splendid
fighting
material
as
was
shown
by
their
resistance
at
the
dardanelles
the
rest
were
palestinian
arabs
and
very
inferior
troops
they
were
the
arab
as
a
soldier
is
at
once
stupid
and
cunning
fierce
when
victory
is
on
his
side
but
unreliable
when
things
go
against
him
in
command
of
the
expedition
was
the
famous
djemal
pasha
a
young
turk
general
of
tremendous
energy
but
possessing
small
ability
to
see
beyond
details
to
the
big
broad
concepts
of
strategy
although
a
great
friend
of
enver
pasha
he
looked
with
disfavor
on
the
german
officers
and
in
particular
on
bach
pasha
the
german
governor
of
jerusalem
with
whom
he
had
serious
disagreements
this
dislike
of
the
germans
was
reflected
among
the
lesser
turkish
officers
many
of
these
after
long
years
of
service
found
themselves
subordinated
to
young
foreigners
who
in
addition
to
arbitrary
promotion
received
much
higher
salaries
than
the
turks
what
is
more
they
were
paid
in
clinking
gold
whereas
the
turks
when
paid
at
all
got
paper
currency
beersheba
a
prosperous
town
of
the
ancient
province
of
idumea
was
the
southern
base
of
operations
for
the
advance
on
suez
some
of
our
villagers
had
been
sent
to
this
district
and
in
searching
for
them
i
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
at
least
the
place
of
the
expedition
beyond
this
point
no
jew
or
christian
was
allowed
to
pass
with
the
exception
of
the
physicians
all
of
whom
were
who
had
been
forced
into
the
army
beersheba
was
swarming
with
troops
they
filled
the
town
and
overflowed
on
to
the
sands
outside
where
a
great
grew
up
and
everywhere
that
the
turkish
soldiers
went
disorganization
and
inefficiency
followed
them
from
all
over
the
country
the
finest
camels
had
been
requisitioned
and
sent
down
to
beersheba
until
at
the
time
i
was
there
thousands
and
thousands
of
them
were
collected
in
the
neighborhood
through
the
laziness
and
stupidity
of
the
turkish
commissariat
officers
which
no
amount
of
german
efficiency
could
counteract
no
adequate
provision
was
made
for
feeding
them
and
incredible
numbers
succumbed
to
starvation
and
neglect
their
great
carcasses
dotted
the
sand
in
all
directions
it
was
only
the
wonderful
antiseptic
power
of
the
eastern
sun
that
held
pestilence
in
check
the
soldiers
themselves
suffered
much
hardship
the
crowding
in
the
tents
was
unspeakable
the
was
almost
as
inadequate
as
the
medical
service
which
consisted
chiefly
of
volunteer
red
crescent
societies
among
them
a
unit
of
twenty
german
nurses
sent
by
the
american
college
at
beirut
medical
supplies
such
as
they
were
had
been
taken
from
the
different
mission
hospitals
and
pharmacies
of
palestine
these
requisitions
being
made
by
officers
who
knew
nothing
of
medical
requirements
and
simply
scooped
together
everything
in
sight
as
a
result
one
of
the
army
physicians
told
me
that
in
beersheba
he
had
opened
some
medical
chests
consigned
to
him
and
found
to
his
horror
that
they
were
full
of
microscopes
and
gynecological
instruments
for
the
care
of
wounded
soldiers
in
the
desert
visits
of
british
aeroplanes
to
beersheba
were
common
occurrences
long
before
the
machine
itself
could
be
seen
its
whanging
resonant
hum
would
come
floating
out
of
the
blazing
sky
seemingly
from
everywhere
at
once
soldiers
rushed
from
their
tents
squinting
up
into
the
heavens
until
the
speck
was
discovered
swimming
slowly
through
the
air
then
followed
wholesale
firing
at
an
impossible
range
until
the
officers
forbade
it
true
to
the
policy
of
avoiding
all
unnecessary
harm
to
the
natives
these
british
aviators
never
dropped
bombs
on
the
town
but
what
was
more
dangerous
from
the
turkish
point
of
view
they
would
unload
packages
of
pamphlets
printed
in
arabic
informing
the
natives
that
they
were
being
deceived
that
the
allies
were
their
only
true
friends
that
the
germans
were
merely
making
use
of
them
to
further
their
own
schemes
etc
these
cleverly
worded
little
tracts
came
showering
down
out
of
the
sky
and
at
first
they
were
eagerly
picked
up
the
turkish
commanders
however
soon
announced
that
any
one
found
carrying
them
would
pay
the
death
penalty
after
that
when
the
little
bundles
dropped
near
them
the
natives
would
run
as
if
from
high
explosive
bombs
all
things
considered
it
is
wonderful
that
the
turkish
demonstration
against
the
canal
came
as
near
to
fulfillment
as
it
did
twenty
thousand
soldiers
actually
crossed
the
desert
in
six
days
on
scant
rations
and
with
them
they
took
two
big
guns
which
they
dragged
by
hand
when
the
mules
dropped
from
thirst
and
exhaustion
they
also
carried
pontoons
to
be
used
in
crossing
the
canal
guns
and
pontoons
are
now
at
rest
in
the
museum
at
cairo
just
what
took
place
in
the
attack
is
known
to
very
few
the
english
have
not
seen
fit
to
make
public
the
details
and
there
was
little
to
be
got
from
the
demoralized
soldiers
who
returned
to
beersheba
piece
by
piece
however
i
gathered
that
the
attacking
party
had
come
up
to
the
canal
at
dawn
finding
everything
quiet
they
set
about
getting
across
and
had
even
launched
a
pontoon
when
the
british
who
were
lying
in
wait
opened
a
terrific
fire
from
the
farther
bank
backed
by
armored
locomotives
and
aeroplanes
it
was
as
if
the
gates
of
jehannum
were
opened
and
its
fires
turned
loose
upon
us
one
soldier
told
me
the
turks
succeeded
in
getting
their
guns
into
action
for
a
very
short
while
one
of
the
in
the
canal
was
hit
several
houses
in
ismaïlia
suffered
damage
but
the
invaders
were
soon
driven
away
in
confusion
leaving
perhaps
two
thousand
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
the
english
if
the
latter
had
chosen
to
do
so
they
could
have
annihilated
the
turkish
forces
then
and
there
the
ticklish
state
of
mind
of
the
mohammedan
population
in
egypt
however
has
led
them
to
adopt
a
policy
of
leniency
and
of
keeping
to
the
defensive
which
subsequent
developments
have
more
than
justified
it
is
characteristic
of
faculty
for
holding
her
colonies
that
batteries
manned
by
egyptians
did
the
finest
work
in
defense
of
the
canal
the
reaction
in
palestine
after
the
defeat
at
suez
was
tremendous
just
before
the
attack
djemal
pasha
had
sent
out
a
telegram
announcing
the
overwhelming
defeat
of
the
british
vanguard
which
had
caused
wild
enthusiasm
another
later
telegram
proclaimed
that
the
canal
had
been
reached
british
sunk
the
englishmen
routed
with
a
loss
to
the
turks
of
five
men
and
two
camels
which
were
afterwards
recovered
but
added
the
telegram
a
terrible
having
arisen
the
glorious
army
takes
it
as
the
wish
of
allah
not
to
continue
the
attack
and
has
therefore
withdrawn
in
triumph
these
reports
hoodwinked
the
ignorant
natives
for
a
little
while
but
when
the
stream
of
haggard
soldiers
wounded
and
exhausted
began
pouring
back
from
the
south
they
guessed
what
had
happened
and
a
fierce
revulsion
against
the
régime
set
in
a
few
weeks
before
the
advance
on
suez
i
was
in
jaffa
where
the
enthusiasm
and
excitement
had
been
at
parades
and
celebrations
of
all
kinds
in
anticipation
of
the
triumphal
march
into
egypt
were
taking
place
and
one
day
a
camel
a
dog
and
a
bull
decorated
respectively
with
the
flags
of
russia
france
and
england
were
driven
through
the
streets
the
poor
animals
were
horribly
maltreated
by
the
natives
who
rained
blows
and
flung
filth
upon
them
by
way
of
giving
concrete
expression
to
their
contempt
for
the
allies
glazebrook
the
american
consul
at
jerusalem
happened
to
be
with
me
in
jaffa
that
day
and
never
shall
i
forget
the
expression
of
pain
and
disgust
on
his
face
as
he
watched
this
melancholy
little
procession
of
scapegoats
hurrying
along
the
street
now
however
all
was
changed
the
arabs
who
take
defeat
badly
turned
against
the
authorities
who
had
got
them
into
such
trouble
rumors
circulated
that
djemal
pasha
had
been
bought
by
the
english
and
that
the
defeat
at
suez
had
been
planned
by
him
and
persons
keeping
an
ear
close
to
the
ground
began
to
hear
mutterings
of
a
general
massacre
of
germans
in
fact
things
came
within
an
ace
of
a
bloody
outbreak
i
knew
some
germans
in
jaffa
and
haifa
who
firmly
believed
that
it
was
all
over
with
them
in
the
defeated
army
itself
the
turkish
officers
gave
vent
to
their
hatred
of
the
germans
three
german
officers
were
shot
by
their
turkish
comrades
during
the
retreat
and
a
fourth
committed
suicide
however
djemal
pasha
succeeded
in
keeping
order
by
means
of
stern
repressive
methods
and
by
the
fear
roused
by
his
large
of
faithful
anatolians
illustration
railroad
station
scene
between
haifa
and
bringing
in
newly
cut
trees
damascus
we
felt
sure
that
the
turkish
defeat
would
put
a
damper
on
the
arrogance
of
the
soldiery
but
even
the
mohammedan
population
were
hoping
that
the
allies
would
push
their
victory
and
land
troops
in
syria
and
palestine
for
though
they
hated
the
infidel
they
loved
the
turk
not
at
all
and
the
country
was
exhausted
and
the
blockade
of
the
mediterranean
by
the
allies
prevented
the
import
and
export
of
articles
the
oranges
were
rotting
on
the
trees
because
the
annual
liverpool
market
was
closed
to
palestine
and
other
crops
were
in
similar
case
the
country
was
short
too
of
petroleum
sugar
rice
and
other
supplies
and
even
of
matches
we
had
to
go
back
to
old
customs
and
use
flint
and
steel
for
fire
and
we
seldom
used
our
lamps
money
was
scarce
too
and
turkey
having
declared
a
moratorium
cash
was
often
unobtainable
even
by
those
who
had
money
in
the
banks
and
much
distress
ensued
as
the
defeated
army
was
pouring
in
from
the
south
i
decided
to
leave
beersheba
and
go
home
the
roads
and
the
fields
were
covered
with
dead
camels
and
horses
and
mules
hundreds
of
soldiers
were
straggling
in
disorder
many
of
them
on
leave
but
many
deserting
soon
after
the
defeat
at
the
canal
several
thousand
soldiers
deserted
but
an
amnesty
was
declared
and
they
returned
to
their
regiments
when
i
arrived
at
jerusalem
i
found
the
city
filled
with
soldiers
djemal
pasha
had
just
returned
from
the
desert
and
his
quarters
were
guarded
by
a
battery
of
two
field
guns
nobody
knew
what
to
expect
some
thought
that
the
country
would
have
a
little
more
freedom
now
that
the
soldiery
had
lost
its
braggadocio
while
others
expected
the
lawlessness
that
attends
disorganization
i
went
to
see
consul
glazebrook
he
is
a
true
american
a
southerner
formerly
a
professor
of
theology
at
princeton
he
was
most
earnest
and
devoted
in
behalf
of
the
american
citizens
that
came
under
his
care
rendering
at
jerusalem
the
same
sort
of
service
that
ambassador
morgenthau
has
rendered
at
constantinople
he
was
practically
the
only
man
who
stood
up
for
the
poor
defenseless
people
of
the
city
he
received
me
kindly
and
i
told
him
what
i
knew
of
conditions
in
the
country
what
i
had
heard
among
the
arabs
and
of
my
own
fears
and
apprehensions
he
was
visibly
impressed
and
he
advised
me
to
see
captain
decker
of
the
tennessee
who
was
then
in
jaffa
promising
to
write
himself
to
the
captain
of
my
proposed
visit
i
went
to
jaffa
the
same
day
and
after
two
days
delay
succeeded
in
seeing
captain
decker
with
the
further
help
of
glazebrook
who
took
me
with
him
the
police
interfered
and
tried
to
keep
me
from
going
aboard
the
ship
but
after
long
discussions
i
was
permitted
to
take
my
place
in
the
launch
that
the
captain
had
sent
for
the
consul
captain
decker
was
interested
in
what
i
had
to
say
and
at
his
request
i
dictated
my
story
to
his
stenographer
what
became
of
my
report
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
transmitted
to
the
department
of
state
or
whether
captain
decker
communicated
with
ambassador
morgenthau
but
at
all
events
we
soon
began
to
see
certain
reforms
inaugurated
in
parts
of
the
country
and
these
reforms
could
have
been
effected
only
through
pressure
from
constantinople
the
presence
of
the
two
american
cruisers
in
the
mediterranean
waters
has
without
any
doubt
been
instrumental
in
the
saving
of
many
lives
chapter
vii
fighting
the
locusts
while
i
was
traveling
in
the
south
another
menace
to
our
welfare
had
appeared
the
locusts
from
the
soudan
they
came
in
tremendous
hosts
black
clouds
of
them
that
obscured
the
sun
it
seemed
as
if
nature
had
joined
in
the
conspiracy
against
us
these
locusts
were
of
the
species
known
as
the
pilgrim
or
wandering
locust
for
forty
years
they
had
not
come
to
palestine
but
now
their
visitation
was
like
that
of
which
the
prophet
joel
speaks
in
the
old
testament
they
came
ripe
for
breeding
the
ground
was
covered
with
the
females
digging
in
the
soil
and
depositing
their
and
we
knew
that
when
they
hatched
we
should
be
overwhelmed
for
there
was
not
a
foot
of
ground
in
which
these
eggs
were
not
to
be
found
the
menace
was
so
great
that
even
the
military
authorities
were
obliged
to
take
notice
of
it
they
realized
that
if
it
were
allowed
to
fulfill
itself
there
would
be
famine
in
the
land
and
the
army
would
suffer
with
the
rest
djemal
pasha
summoned
my
brother
the
president
of
the
agricultural
experiment
station
at
athlit
and
intrusted
him
with
the
organization
of
a
campaign
against
the
insects
it
was
a
hard
enough
task
the
arabs
are
lazy
and
fatalistic
besides
they
can
not
understand
why
men
should
attempt
to
fight
the
god
army
as
they
call
the
locusts
in
addition
my
brother
was
seriously
handicapped
by
lack
of
petroleum
galvanized
iron
and
other
articles
which
could
not
be
obtained
because
of
the
allies
blockade
in
spite
of
these
drawbacks
however
he
attempted
to
work
up
a
scientific
campaign
djemal
pasha
put
some
thousands
of
arab
soldiers
at
his
disposition
and
these
were
set
to
work
digging
trenches
into
which
the
hatching
locusts
were
driven
and
destroyed
this
is
the
only
means
of
coping
with
the
situation
once
the
locusts
get
their
wings
nothing
can
be
done
with
them
it
was
a
hopeless
fight
nothing
short
of
the
coöperation
of
every
farmer
in
the
country
could
have
won
the
day
and
while
the
people
of
the
progressive
jewish
villages
struggled
on
to
the
end
men
women
and
children
working
in
the
fields
until
they
were
exhausted
the
arab
farmers
sat
by
with
folded
hands
the
threats
of
the
military
authorities
only
stirred
them
to
efforts
finally
after
two
months
of
toil
the
campaign
was
given
up
and
the
locusts
broke
in
waves
over
the
countryside
destroying
everything
as
the
prophet
joel
said
the
field
is
wasted
the
land
mourneth
for
the
corn
is
wasted
the
new
wine
is
dried
up
the
oil
languisheth
the
land
is
as
the
garden
of
eden
before
them
and
behind
them
a
desolate
wilderness
not
only
was
every
green
leaf
devoured
but
the
very
bark
was
peeled
from
the
trees
which
stood
out
white
and
lifeless
like
skeletons
the
fields
were
stripped
to
the
ground
and
the
old
men
of
our
villages
who
had
given
their
lives
to
cultivating
these
gardens
and
vineyards
came
out
of
the
synagogues
where
they
had
been
praying
and
wailing
and
looked
on
the
ruin
with
dimmed
eyes
nothing
was
spared
the
insects
in
their
fierce
hunger
tried
to
engulf
everything
in
their
way
i
have
seen
arab
babies
left
by
their
mothers
in
the
shade
of
some
tree
whose
faces
had
been
devoured
by
the
oncoming
swarms
of
locusts
before
their
screams
had
been
heard
i
have
seen
the
carcasses
of
animals
hidden
from
sight
by
the
undulating
rustling
blanket
of
insects
and
in
the
face
of
such
a
menace
the
arabs
remained
inert
with
their
customary
fatalism
they
accepted
the
locust
plague
as
a
necessary
evil
they
could
not
understand
why
we
were
so
frantic
to
fight
it
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
really
got
a
good
deal
out
of
the
locusts
for
they
loved
to
feast
upon
the
female
insects
they
gathered
piles
of
them
and
threw
them
upon
burning
charcoal
then
squatting
around
the
fire
devoured
the
roasted
insects
with
great
gusto
i
saw
a
boy
eat
as
many
as
a
hundred
at
a
sitting

viii
the
lebanon
during
the
locust
invasion
my
brother
sent
me
on
an
inspection
tour
to
investigate
the
ravages
of
the
insect
in
syria
with
an
official
passport
in
my
pocket
i
was
able
to
travel
all
over
the
country
without
being
interfered
with
by
the
military
authorities
i
had
an
excellent
opportunity
to
see
what
was
going
on
everywhere
the
locusts
had
destroyed
everything
from
as
far
south
as
the
egyptian
desert
to
the
lebanon
mountains
on
the
north
but
the
locust
was
not
the
only
nor
the
worst
plague
that
the
people
had
to
complain
of
the
plundering
under
the
name
of
military
requisitions
the
despotic
rule
of
the
army
officers
and
the
general
insecurity
were
even
more
desolating
as
i
proceeded
on
my
journey
northward
i
hoped
to
find
consolation
and
brighter
prospects
in
the
independent
province
of
the
lebanon
few
americans
know
just
what
the
lebanon
is
from
the
repeated
allusions
in
the
bible
most
people
imagine
it
to
be
nothing
but
a
mountain
the
truth
is
that
a
beautiful
province
of
about
four
thousand
square
miles
bears
that
name
the
population
of
the
lebanon
consists
of
a
christian
sect
called
maronites
and
the
druses
the
latter
a
people
with
a
secret
religion
the
esoteric
teachings
of
which
are
known
only
to
the
initiated
and
never
divulged
to
outsiders
both
these
peoples
are
sturdy
handsome
folk
through
the
machinations
of
the
turks
whose
policy
is
always
to
divide
and
rule
the
maronites
were
continually
fighting
against
the
druses
in
turkish
troops
joined
with
the
druses
and
fell
upon
the
maronites
with
wholesale
massacres
that
spread
as
far
south
as
damascus
where
ten
thousand
christians
were
killed
in
two
days
illustration
the
christian
town
of
zahleh
in
the
lebanon
the
european
powers
were
moved
at
last
fifty
warships
were
sent
to
beirut
and
ten
thousand
french
troops
were
landed
in
the
lebanon
to
create
order
under
the
pressure
of
the
european
powers
the
sublime
porte
was
forced
to
grant
an
autonomy
for
the
province
of
the
lebanon
the
french
english
german
russian
austrian
and
a
year
later
the
italian
governments
were
signing
the
guaranty
of
this
autonomy
since
then
the
lebanon
has
had
peace
the
governor
of
the
province
must
always
be
a
christian
but
the
general
council
of
the
lebanon
includes
representatives
of
all
the
different
races
and
religions
of
the
population
a
wonderful
development
began
with
the
liberation
from
turkish
oppression
macadamized
roads
were
built
all
over
the
province
agriculture
was
improved
and
there
was
complete
safety
for
life
and
property
there
is
a
proverb
now
in
palestine
and
syria
which
says
in
the
lebanon
a
virgin
may
travel
alone
at
midnight
and
be
safe
and
a
purse
of
gold
dropped
in
the
road
at
midday
will
never
be
stolen
and
the
proverb
told
the
literal
truth
when
one
crossed

boundary
from
turkish
palestine

the

sixty
years
england
has
been
the
friend
of
the
druses
and
they
have
not
forgotten
it
it
may
be
worth
while
to
tell
in
a
few
words
the
story
of
one
man
who
accomplished
wonders
in
spreading
the
influence
of
his
country
sir
richard
wood
was
born
in
london
a
son
of
catholic
parents
from
his
early
boyhood
he
aspired
to
enter
the
diplomatic
service
the
east
attracted
him
strongly
and
in
order
to
learn
arabic
he
went
with
another
young
englishman
to
live
in
the
lebanon
in
beirut
they
sought
the
hospitality
of
the
maronite
patriarch
for
a
few
days
they
were
treated
with
lavish
hospitality
and
then
the
patriarch
summoned
them
before
him
and
told
them
that
they
must
leave
the
city
within
hours
the
reason
for
their
disgrace
they
discovered
later
not
suspecting
that
they
were
being
put
to
the
test
they
had
eaten
meat
on
a
friday
and
this
made
the
patriarch
think
that
they
were
not
true
catholics
but
were
there
as
spies
leaving
beirut
in
haste
wood
and
his
friend
sought
shelter
with
the
druses
who
received
them
with
open
arms
for
two
years
wood
lived
among
the
druses
in
the
village
of
obey
there
he
learned
arabic
and
became
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
country
and
with
the
ways
of
the
druses
and
there
he
conceived
the
idea
of
winning
the
druses
for
england
to
counteract
the
influence
of
the
french
maronites
he
went
back
to
london
where
he
succeeded
in
impressing
his
views
upon
the
foreign
office
and
he
returned
to
syria
charged
with
a
secret
mission
before
long
he
persuaded
the
druse
chieftains
to
address
a
petition
to
england
asking
for
british
protection
british
protection
was
granted
and
for
over
thirty
years
richard
wood
virtually
shaped
the
destiny
of
syria
it
was
he
who
broke
the
power
of
ibrahim
pasha
the
son
of
mehemet
ali
it
was
he
who
guided
admiral
stopford
in
the
bombardment
of
beirut
it
was
he
again
who
brought
about
the
landing
of
english
troops
in
syria
in
we
find
him
afterwards
in
damascus
as
british
consul
and
wherever
he
went
he
was
always
busy
spreading
english
power
and
prestige
he
understood
the
east
thoroughly
and
felt
that
england
must
be
strong
in
syria
if
she
wished
to
retain
her
imperial
power
it
is
very
unfortunate
that
the
policy
of
sir
richard
wood
was
not
carried
out
by
his
nation
it
was
with
high
hopes
and
expectations
that
i
approached
the
lebanon
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
moment
when
i
should
find
myself
among
people
who
were
free
from
the
turkish
yoke
in
a
country
where
i
should
be
able
to
breathe
freely
for
a
few
hours
but
how
great
was
my
consternation
when
on
entering
the
lebanon
i
found
on
all
the
roads
turkish
soldiers
who
stopped
me
every
minute
to
ask
for
my
papers
even
then
i
could
not
realize
that
the
worst
had
happened
of
course
rumors
of
the
turkish
occupation
of
the
lebanon
had
reached
us
a
few
weeks
before
but
we
had
not
believed
it
as
we
knew
that
germany
and
austria
were
among
those
who
guaranteed
the
autonomy
of
the
lebanon
it
was
true
however
the
scrap
of
paper
that
guaranteed
the
freedom
of
the
lebanon
had
proved
of
no
more
value
to
the
lebanese
than
had
that
other
scrap
of
paper
to
belgium
as
i
entered
the
beautiful
village
of
one
of
the
most
prosperous
and
enchanting
places
on
earth
i
saw
entire
regiments
of
turkish
troops
encamped
in
and
about
the
village
while
i
was
watering
my
horse
i
tried
to
ask
questions
from
a
few
inhabitants
my
fair
hair
and
complexion
and
my
khaki
costume
made
them
take
me
for
a
german
and
they
barely
answered
me
but
when
i
addressed
them
in
french
their
faces
lit
up
for
the
lebanon
for
all
it
is
thousands
of
miles
away
from
france
is
nevertheless
like
a
french
province
for
fifty
years
the
french
language
and
french
culture
have
taken
hold
of
the
lebanon
no
frenchman
has
more
love
for
and
faith
in
france
than
lie
in
the
hearts
of
the
lebanese
christians
they
have
never
forgotten
that
when
massacres
were
threatening
to
wipe
out
all
the
christians
of
the
lebanon
ten
thousand
french
soldiers
swept
over
the
mountains
to
spread
peace
life
and
french
gayety
and
when
the
poor
people
heard
the
language
they
loved
and
when
they
found
out
that
i
too
was
the
son
of
an
oppressed
and
ruined
community
all
the
sadness
and
bitterness
of
their
hearts
was
told
me
how
the
turkish
soldiers
had
spread
over
the
beloved
mountains
of
lebanon
how
the
strong
stalwart
young
lebanese
had
been
taken
away
from
the
mountains
and
forced
into
the
turkish
army
how
the
girls
and
women
were
hiding
in
their
homes
afraid
to
be
seen
by
the
soldiers
and
their
officers
how
the
chieftains
were
imprisoned
and
even
hanged
and
how
violence
and
pillage
had
spread
over
the
peaceful
country
footnote
since
the
above
was
written
the
american
press
has
chronicled
many
atrocities
committed
in
the
lebanon
the
execution
of
leaders
and
the
complete
blockade
of
the
mountains
by
the
turkish
authorities
resulted
in
the
starving
of
eighty
thousand
lebanese
the
french
government
has
warned
turkey
through
the
american
ambassador
that
the
turks
will
be
held
accountable
for
their
deeds
i
could
not
help
wondering
at
the
mistakes
of
the
allies
if
they
had
understood
the
situation
in
palestine
and
syria
how
differently
this
war
might
have
eventuated
the
lebanon
and
syria
would
have
raised
a
hundred
thousand
picked
men
if
the
allies
had
landed
in
palestine
the
lebanon
would
have
fought
for
its
independence
as
heroically
as
did
the
belgians
even
the
arab
population
would
have
welcomed
the
allies
as
liberators
but
alas
with
a
saddened
heart
i
pursued
my
journey
into
beirut
my
coming
was
a
joyful
surprise
to
my
sister
many
sad
things
had
happened
since
she
had
last
seen
me
during
my
imprisonment
she
had
suffered
tortures
not
knowing
what
would
happen
to
me
and
now
that
she
saw
me
alive
she
cried
from
happiness
she
told
me
how
kindly
she
had
been
treated
by
president
bliss
of
the
syrian
protestant
college
and
of
all
the
good
things
the
college
had
done
what
a
blessing
the
college
was
for
the
people
of
beirut
many
unfortunate
people
were
saved
from
prison
and
hardships
through
the
intervention
of
president
bliss
he
never
tired
of
rendering
service
wonderful
personal
service
but
alas
even
his
influence
and
power
began
to
wane
the
american
prestige
in
the
country
was
broken
and
the
turkish
government
no
longer
respected
the
american
flag
an
order
issued
from
constantinople
demanded
that
the
official
language
of
the
college
be
turkish
instead
of
english
and
turkish
officers
even
dared
to
enter
the
college
premises
to
search
for
citizens
belonging
to
the
belligerent
nations
without
troubling
to
ask
permission
from
the
american
consul

is
a
city
of
about
two
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
half
of
whom
are
christians
and
the
rest
mohammedans
and

the
pinch
of
hunger
was
already
felt
there
bread
was
to
be
had
only
on
tickets
issued
by
the
government
and
prices
in
general
were
extremely
high
the
population
were
discontented
and
turbulent
and
every
day
thousands
of
women
came
before
the
governor
residence
to
cry
and
protest
against
the
scarcity
of
bread
the
allies
warships
often
passed
near
the
town
but
the
people
were
not
afraid
of
them
for
it
was
known
that
the
allies
had
no
intention
of
bombarding
the
cities
only
once
had
a
bombardment
taken
place
toward
the
end
of
march
a
french
warship
approached
the
bay
of
haifa
and
landed
an
officer
with
a
letter
to
the
commandant
of
that
town
giving
notice
of
his
intention
to
bombard
the
german
consulate
at
sharp
this
was
in
retaliation
for
the
propaganda
carried
on
by
the
consul
leutweld
von
hardegg
and
chiefly
because
of
his
desecration
of
the
grave
of
bonaparte

the
consul
had
time
to
pack
up
his
archives
and
valuables
and
he
left
his
house

were
fired
with
a
wonderful
precision
not

of

consulate
was
touched
but
the
consulate
itself
was
a
heap
of
ruins
after
a
few
shells
had
struck
it
the
population
was
exceedingly
calm
only
the
german
colony
was
and
on
every
german
house
an
american
flag
was
raised
it
was
rather
humorous
to
see
all
the
germans
who
were
active
in
the
turkish
army
in
one
capacity
or
another
seek
safety
by
means
of
this
trick
this
bombardment
had
a
sobering
effect
upon
the
mohammedan
population
they
saw
that
the

were
not
wholly
ignorant
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
country
and
that
they
could
retaliate

in
general
beirut
was
a
rather
quiet
and
safe
place
the
presence
of
an
american
cruiser
in
the
port
had
much
to
do
with
that
the
american
sailors
were
allowed
to
come
ashore
three
times
a
week
and
they
spent
their
money
lavishly
it
was
estimated
that
beirut
was
getting
more
than
five
thousand
dollars
a
week
out
of
them
but
the
natives
were
especially
impressed
by
the
manliness
and
quick
action
of
the
american
boys
frequently
a
few
sailors
were
involved
in
a
street
fight
with
scores
of
arabs
and
they
always
held
their
own
in
a
short
time
the
americans
became
feared
which
in
the
orient
is
equivalent
to
saying
they
were

the

people
are
famous
for
their
fighting
spirit

the
country
about
one
hour
ride
on
horseback
from
our
village
lives
a
family
of
turkish
nobles
the
head
of
which
was
sadik
pasha
brother
of
the
famous
kiamil
pasha
several
times
grand
vizier
of
the
empire
sadik
who
had
been
exiled
from
constantinople
came
to
palestine
and
bought
great
tracts
of
land
near
my
people
after
his
death
his
sons
wild
fellows
were
forced
to
sell
most
of
the
estate
all
except
one
fewzi
bey
who
retained
his
part
of
the
land
and
lived
on
it
here
he
collected
a
band
of
friends
as
worthless
as
himself
and
gradually
commenced
a
career
of
plundering
and
frightfulness
much
like
that
of
the
robber
barons
of
mediaeval
germany
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
he
confined
his
attentions
chiefly
to
the
arabs
whom
he
treated
shamefully
he
raided
cattle
and
crops
and
carried
off
girls
and
women
in
broad
daylight
on
one
occasion
he
stopped
a
wedding
procession
and
carried
off
the
young
bride
then
he
seized
the
bridegroom
against
whom
he
bore
a
grudge
and
subjected
the
poor
bedouin
to
the
bastinado
until
he
consented
to
divorce
his
wife
by
pronouncing
the
words
i
divorce
thee
three
times
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
according
to
mohammedan
custom
this
bedouin
was
the
grandson
of
the
sheikh
hilou
a
holy
man
of
the
region
upon
whose
grave
the
arabs
are
accustomed
to
make
their
prayers
but
we
villagers
of
had
never
submitted
to
fewzi
bey
in
any
way
our
young
men
were
organized
and
armed
and
after
a
few
encounters
he
let
us
alone
after
the
mobilization
however
and
the
taking
away
of
our
arms
this
outlaw
saw
that
his
chance
had
come
he
began
to
send
his
men
and
his
camels
into
our
fields
to
harvest
our
crops
and
carry
them
off
this
pillage
continued
until
the
locusts
came
fewzi
in
the
mean
while
becoming
so
bold
that
he
would
gallop
through
the
streets
of
our
village
with
his
horsemen
shooting
right
and
left
into
the
air
and
insulting
old
men
and
women
he
boasted
apparently
with
reason
that
the
authorities
at
haifa
were
powerless
to
touch
him
illustration
haifa
and
the
bay
of
akka
looking
east
from
mount
carmel
there
was
one
hope
left
djemal
pasha
had
boasted
that
he
had
introduced
law
and
order
the
country
was
under
military
rule
it
remained
to
see
what
he
would
say
and
do
when
the
crimes
of
fewzi
bey
were
brought
to
his
notice
accordingly
armed
with
my
or
passport
of
a
i
rode
to
jerusalem
where
i
procured
through
my
brother
who
was
then
in
favor
an
interview
with
djemal
pasha
he
received
me
on
the
very
day
of
my
arrival
and
listened
attentively
while
for
a
whole
hour
i
poured
out
the
story
of
fewzi
bey
outrages
i
put
my
whole
heart
into
the
plea
and
wound
up
by
asking
if
it
was
to
the
credit
of
the
progressive
young
turks
to
shelter
feudal
abuses
of
a
bygone
age
djemal
seemed
to
be
impressed
he
sprang
from
his
chair
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
then
with
a
great
dramatic
gesture
he
exclaimed
justice
shall
be
rendered
and
assured
me
that
a
commission
of
army
officers
would
be
sent
at
once
to
start
an
investigation
i
returned
to
with
high
hopes
sure
enough
a
few
days
later
fewzi
bey
was
summoned
to
jerusalem
at
the
same
time
the
commission
which
had
dwindled
to
one
single
officer
on
secret
mission
put
in
an
appearance
and
began
to
make
inquiries
among
the
natives
he
got
little
satisfaction
at
first
for
they
lived
in
mortal
terror
of
the
outlaw
they
grew
bolder
however
when
they
learned
his
purpose
complaints
and
testimonies
came
pouring
in
and
in
four
days
the
officer
had
the
names
of
hundreds
of
witnesses
establishing
no
less
than
crimes
of
the
most
serious
nature
fewzi
friends
and
relatives
in
the
mean
while
were
doing
their
utmost
to
stem
the
tide
of
accusations
the
kaimakam
governor
of
haifa
came
in
person
to
our
village
and
threatened
the
elders
with
all
sorts
of
severities
if
they
did
not
retract
the
charges
they
had
made
but
they
stood
firm
had
not
djemal
pasha
chief
of
the
armies
in
palestine
given
his
word
of
honor
that
we
should
have
redress
we
were
soon
shown
the
depth
of
our
naïveté
in
fancying
that
justice
could
be
done
in
turkey
by
a
turk
fewzi
bey
came
back
from
jerusalem
not
in
convict
clothes
but
in
the
uniform
of
a
turkish
officer
djemal
pasha
had
commissioned
him
commandant
of
the
moujahaddeen
religious
militia
of
the
entire
region
it
was
bad
enough
to
stand
him
as
an
outlaw
now
we
had
to
submit
to
him
as
an
officer
he
came
riding
into
our
village
daily
ordering
everybody
about
and
picking
me
out
for
distinguished
spitefulness
my
position
soon
became
unbearable
i
was
of
course
known
as
the
organizer
of
the
young
men
union
which
for
so
long
had
put
up
a
spirited
resistance
to
fewzi
i
was
still
looked
upon
as
a
leader
of
the
younger
spirits
and
i
knew
that
sooner
or
later
fewzi
would
try
to
make
good
his
threat
often
repeated
that
he
would
shoot
me
like
a
dog
it
was
hardly
likely
that
an
open
attempt
on
my
life
would
be
made
when
ambassador
morgenthau
visited
palestine
he
had
stayed
in
our
village
and
given
my
family
the
evidence
of
his
sincere
friendship
these
things
count
in
the
east
and
i
soon
got
the
reputation
of
having
influential
friends
however
there
were
other
ways
of
disposing
of
me
one
evening
about
sunset
while
i
was
riding
through
a
valley
near
our
village
my
horse
shied
violently
in
passing
a
clump
of
bushes
i
gave
him
the
spur
and
turned
and
rode
toward
the
bushes
just
in
time
to
see
a
horseman
dash
out
wildly
with
a
rifle
across
his
saddle
i
kept
the
incident
to
myself
but
i
was
more
cautious
and
kept
my
eyes
open
wherever
i
went
one
afternoon
a
fortnight
later
as
i
was
riding
to
hedera
another
jewish
village
two
hours
ride
away
a
shot
was
fired
from
behind
a
the
bullet
burned
a
hole
in
the
lapel
of
my
coat
that
night
i
had
a
long
talk
with
my
brother
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
in
his
mind
that
i
should
try
to
leave
the
country
while
i
on
the
contrary
could
not
bear
to
think
of
deserting
my
people
at
the
crisis
of
their
fortunes
it
was
a
beautiful
night
such
a
night
i
think
as
only
palestine
can
show
a
white
serene
night
the
roar
of
the
mediterranean
came
out
of
the
stillness
as
if
to
remind
us
that
help
and
salvation
could
come
only
from
the
sea
the
sea
upon
which
scores
of
the
warships
of
the
allies
were
sailing
back
and
forth
we
had
argued
into
the
small
hours
before
i
yielded
to
his
persuasion
illustration
the
bazaar
of
jaffa
on
a
market
day
chapter
x
a
rash
adventure
it
was
all
very
well
to
decide
to
leave
the
country
to
get
safely
away
was
a
different
matter
there
were
two
ways
out
one
of
these
the
land
route
by
constantinople
could
not
be
considered
the
other
way
was
to
board
one
of
the
american
cruisers
which
by
order
of
ambassador
morgenthau
were
empowered
to
assist
citizens
of
neutral
countries
to
leave
the
ottoman
empire
these
cruisers
had
already
done
wonderful
rescue
work
for
the
russian
jews
in
palestine
who
when
war
was
declared
were
to
have
been
sent
to
the
mesopotamian
town
of
urfa
there
to
suffer
massacre
and
outrage
like
the
armenians
this
was
prevented
by
morgenthau
strenuous
representations
with
the
result
that
these
russian
jews
were
gathered
together
as
in
a
great
and
herded
to
jaffa
amidst
suffering
unspeakable
there
they
were
met
by
the
american
cruisers
which
were
to
transport
them
to
egypt
up
to
the
very
moment
when
they
set
foot
on
the
friendly
warships
they
were
robbed
and
horribly
abused
by
the
jaffa
boatmen
the
eternal
curse
of
the
wandering
jew
driven
from
russia
they
come
to
seek
shelter
in
turkey
turkey
then
casts
them
from
her
under
pretext
that
they
are
loyal
to
russia
truly
the
jew
lifts
his
eyes
to
the
mountains
asking
the
ancient
and
still
unanswered
question
whence
shall
come
my
help
the
turkish
government
later
repented
of
its
leniency
in
allowing
these
russian
jews
to
escape
and
gave
orders
that
only
neutrals
should
leave
the
country
and
then
only
under
certain
conditions
i
was
not
a
neutral
my
first
papers
of
american
citizenship
were
valueless
to
further
my
escape
i
had
heard
however
that
the
united
states
cruiser
tennessee
was
to
call
at
jaffa
and
i
determined
to
get
aboard
her
by
hook
or
by
crook
one
evening
as
soon
as
darkness
had
fallen
i
bade
a
sorrowful
farewell
to
my
people
and
set
off
for
jaffa
traveling
only
by
night
and
taking
paths
to
avoid
the
pickets
for
now
that
the
locust
campaign
was
over
my
was
useless
at
dawn
two
days
later
i
slipped
into
jaffa
by
way
of
the
and
went
to
the
house
of
a
friend
whom
i
could
trust
to
help
me
in
every
possible
way
and
begged
him
to
find
me
a
passport
for
a
neutral
he
set
off
in
search
and
i
waited
all
day
at
his
house
consumed
with
impatience
and
anxiety
at
last
toward
evening
my
friend
returned
but
the
news
he
brought
was
not
cheering
he
had
found
a
passport
indeed
but
his
report
of
the
rigors
of
the
inspection
at
the
wharf
was
such
as
to
make
it
clear
that
the
chances
of
my
getting
through
on
a
false
passport
were
exceedingly
slim
since
i
was
well
known
in
jaffa
if
i
were
caught
in
such
an
undertaking
it
might
mean
death
for
me
and
punishment
for
the
friends
who
had
helped
me
evidently
this
plan
was
not
feasible
all
that
night
i
racked
my
brain
for
a
solution
finally
i
decided
to
stake
everything
on
what
appeared
to
be
my
only
chance
the
tennessee
was
due
on
the
next
day
but
one
early
in
the
morning
i
gave
my
friend
the
name
of
a
boatman
who
was
under
obligations
to
me
and
had
sworn
to
be
my
friend
for
life
or
death
even
under
the
circumstances
i
hesitated
to
trust
a
mohammedan
but
it
seemed
the
only
thing
to
do
i
had
no
choice
left
my
friend
brought
the
boatman
and
i
put
my
plan
before
him
appealing
to
his
daring
and
his
sense
of
honor
i
wanted
him
to
take
me
at
midnight
in
his
from
an
isolated
part
of
the
coast
and
wait
for
the
appearance
of
the
tennessee
then
on
her
arrival
amid
the
scramble
of
boats
full
of
refugees
i
was
to
jump
aboard
while
he
would
return
with
the
other
boats
the
poor
fellow
tried
to
remonstrate
pointing
out
the
dangers
and
what
he
called
rightly
enough
doubtless
the
folly
of
the
plan
i
stuck
to
it
however
making
it
clear
that
his
part
would
be
well
paid
for
and
at
last
he
consented
and
we
arranged
a
behind
the
by
the
shore
i
put
a
few
personal
belongings
into
a
little
and
had
my
friend
give
it
to
one
of
the
refugees
who
was
to
sail
on
the
tennessee
if
i
succeeded
i
was
to
recover
it
when
we
reached
egypt
the
only
thing
i
took
with
me
was
the
paper
which
declared
my
intention
of
becoming
an
american
citizen
the
first
paper
from
this
document
i
was
determined
not
to
part
i
shall
not
tell
how
i
kept
it
on
me
as
the
means
i
used
may
still
be
used
by
others
in
concealing
such
papers
and
a
disclosure
of
the
secret
might
bring
disaster
to
them
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
had
the
paper
with
me
and
that
no
search
would
have
brought
it
to
light
arrived
next
morning
at
the
appointed
place
i
gave
the
signal
agreed
upon
the
whine
of
a
jackal
and
after
repeating
it
again
and
again
i
heard
a
very
low
and
muffled
answer
my
boatman
was
there
i
had
some
fear
that
he
might
have
betrayed
me
and
that
i
should
presently
see
a
soldier
or
policeman
leap
out
of
the
little
boat
but
my
fears
proved
groundless
the
man
was
faithful
illustration
stormy
sea
breaking
over
rocks
off
jaffa
we
rowed
out
quietly
our
boat
a
little
nutshell
on
the
tossing
waves
but
i
was
relieved
the
elements
did
not
frighten
me
on
the
contrary
i
felt
secure
and
refreshed
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
when
morning
began
to
dawn
scores
of
little
boats
came
out
of
the
harbor
and
circled
about
waiting
for
the
cruiser
this
was
our
chance
i
crouched
in
the
bottom
of
our
boat
and
to
all
appearances
my
boatman
was
engaged
merely
in
fishing
after
i
had
lain
there
over
an
hour
with
my
heart
beating
like
a
drum
and
with
small
hopes
for
the
success
of
my
undertaking
i
heard
at
last
the
whistle
of
the
approaching
cruiser
followed
by
a
babel
of
mad
shouting
and
cursing
among
the
boatmen
in
the
confusion
i
felt
it
safe
to
sit
up
no
one
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
me
all
were
engaged
in
a
wild
race
to
reach
and
mount
the
tennessee
ladder
i
scrambled
up
with
the
rest
and
when
on
the
deck
an
officer
demanded
my
passport
i
put
on
a
bold
front
and
asked
him
to
tell
captain
decker
that
aaronsohn
wished
to
see
him
ten
minutes
later
i
stood
in
the
captain
cabin
there
i
unfolded
my
story
and
wound
up
by
asking
him
if
under
the
circumstances
my
first
papers
might
not
entitle
me
to
protection
as
i
spoke
i
could
see
the
struggle
that
was
going
on
within
him
when
he
answered
it
was
to
explain
with
the
utmost
kindness
that
if
he
took
me
aboard
his
ship
it
would
be
to
forfeit
his
word
of
honor
to
the
turkish
government
his
pledge
to
take
only
citizens
of
neutral
countries
that
he
could
not
consider
me
an
american
on
the
strength
of
my
first
papers
and
that
any
such
evasion
might
lead
to
serious
complications
for
him
and
for
his
government
well
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
withdraw
and
go
back
to
jaffa
to
face
trial
for
an
attempt
to
escape
when
i
reached
the
deck
again
i
found
it
swarming
with
refugees
many
of
whom
knew
me
and
came
up
to
congratulate
me
on
getting
away
i
could
only
shake
my
head
and
with
death
in
my
heart
descend
the
ladder
it
did
not
matter
now
what
boat
i
took
any
boatman
was
eager
enough
to
take
me
for
a
few
cents
as
i
sat
in
the
boat
every
stroke
of
the
oars
bringing
me
nearer
to
the
shore
and
to
what
i
felt
was
inevitable
captivity
a
great
bitterness
swelled
my
heart
i
was
tired
utterly
tired
of
all
the
dangers
and
trials
i
had
been
going
through
for
the
last
months
from
depression
i
sank
into
despair
and
out
of
despair
came
strange
to
say
a
great
serenity
the
serenity
of
despair
on
the
quay
i
ran
into
hassan
bey
commandant
of
the
police
who
was
superintending
the
embarkation
of
refugees
i
knew
him
and
he
knew
me
half
an
hour
later
i
was
in
police
headquarters
under
examination
by
hassan
bey
i
was
desperate
and
answered
him
recklessly
a
seasick
man
is
indifferent
to
shipwreck
this
was
the
substance
of
our
conversation
how
did
you
get
aboard
the
ship
in
a
boat
with
some
refugees
a
woman
hid
me
with
her
skirts
so
you
were
trying
to
escape
were
you
if
i
had
been
i
should
have
come
back
then
what
did
you
do
on
the
cruiser
i
went
to
talk
to
the
captain
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
my
life
is
in
danger
fewzi
bey
is
after
me
and
i
wanted
friends
in
to
know
how
justice
is
done
in
palestine
who
are
your
friends
in
america
men
who
could
break
you
in
a
minute
do
you
know
to
whom
you
are
speaking
yes
hassan
bey
i
am
sick
of
persecution
i
wish
you
would
hang
me
with
your
own
hands
as
you
hanged
the
young
christian
my
friends
would
have
your
life
for
mine
i
wonder
now
how
i
dared
to
speak
to
him
in
this
manner
but
the
bluff
carried
hassan
bey
looked
at
me
curiously
for
a
moment
then
smiled
and
offered
me
a
cigarette
assuring
me
that
he
believed
me
a
loyal
citizen
and
declaring
he
felt
deeply
hurt
that
i
had
not
come
to
him
for
permission
to
visit
the
cruiser
we
parted
with
a
profusion
of
eastern
compliments
and
that
evening
i
started
back
to
illustration
the
author
sister
on
her
horse
tayar
chapter
xi
escape
the
failure
of
my
attempt
to
leave
the
country
only
sharpened
my
desire
to
make
another
trial
the
danger
of
the
enterprise
tended
to
reconcile
me
to
deserting
my
family
and
comrades
and
seeking
safety
for
myself
as
i
racked
my
brain
for
a
promising
plan
a
letter
came
from
my
sister
in
beirut
with
two
pieces
of
news
which
were
responsible
for
my
final
escape
the
american
college
was
shortly
to
close
for
the
summer
and
the
chester
was
to
sail
for
alexandria
with
refugees
aboard
beirut
is
a
four
days
trip
from
our
village
and
roads
are
unsafe
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
permit
my
sister
to
come
home
alone
and
it
was
impossible
for
any
of
us
to
get
leave
to
go
after
her
nor
did
we
want
to
have
her
at
home
in
the
unsettled
condition
of
the
country
i
began
wondering
if
i
could
not
possibly
get
to
beirut
and
get
my
sister
aboard
the
chester
which
offered
perhaps
the
last
opportunity
to
go
out
with
the
refugees
it
would
be
a
difficult
undertaking
but
it
might
be
our
only
chance
and
i
quickly
made
up
my
mind
to
carry
it
out
if
it
were
a
possible
thing
i
had
to
act
immediately
no
time
was
to
be
lost
for
no
one
could
tell
how
soon
the
chester
might
sail
my
last
adventure
had
been
entered
upon
with
forebodings
but
now
i
felt
that
i
should
succeed
to
us
orientals
intuition
speaks
in
very
audible
tones
and
we
are
trained
from
childhood
to
listen
to
its
voice
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
confidence
in
the
outcome
therefore
that
i
bade
this
second
to
my
family
and
dearest
friends
solemn
hours
they
were
these
hours
of
farewell
hours
that
needed
few
words
then
once
more
i
slipped
out
into
the
night
to
make
my
secret
way
to
beirut
it
was
about
midnight
when
i
left
home
dressed
in
a
soldier
uniform
and
driving
a
donkey
before
me
i
traveled
only
by
night
and
spent
each
day
in
hiding
in
some
cave
or
narrow
valley
where
i
could
sleep
with
some
measure
of
security
for
food
i
had
brought
bread
dried
figs
and
chocolate
and
water
was
always
to
be
found
in
little
springs
and
pools
in
these
clear
warm
nights
i
used
to
think
of
david
a
fugitive
and
pursued
by
his
enemies
how
well
i
could
now
understand
his
despairing
cry
how
long
wilt
thou
forget
me
o
lord
for
ever
how
long
shall
mine
enemy
be
exalted
over
me
five
nights
i
journeyed
and
at
last
one
morning
beautiful
beirut
appeared
in
the
distance
and
i
found
myself
in
the
forest
of
pines
that
leads
into
the
city
the
fresh
dawn
was
filled
with
the
balmy
breath
of
the
pines
and
all
the
odors
of
the
lebanon
driving
my
donkey
before
me
i
boldly
approached
the
first
and
saluted
the
officer
in
military
fashion
he
stopped
me
and
asked
whence
i
came
and
where
i
was
going
i
smiled
sweetly
and
replied
that
i
was
the
orderly
of
a
german
officer
who
was
surveying
the
country
a
few
hours
to
the
south
and
that
i
was
going
to
beirut
for
provisions
then
i
lighted
a
cigarette
and
sat
down
for
a
chat
after
discussing
politics
and
the
war
for
a
few
minutes
i
jumped
up
exclaiming
that
if
i
hurry
i
should
be
late
and
so
took
my
departure
it
was
all
so
simple
and
it
brought
me
safely
to
beirut
my
donkey
having
served
the
purpose
for
which
i
had
brought
him
was
speedily
abandoned
and
i
hurried
to
a
friend
house
where
i
exchanged
my
uniform
for
the
garb
of
a
civilian
my
sister
was
the
most
surprised
person
on
earth
when
she
saw
me
walking
into
her
room
and
when
i
told
her
that
i
wanted
her
to
go
with
me
on
the
chester
she
thought
me
crazy
for
she
knew
that
hundreds
of
persons
were
trying
in
vain
to
find
means
of
leaving
the
country
and
it
seemed
to
her
impossible
that
we
who
were
turkish
subjects
could
succeed
in
outwitting
the
authorities
even
when
i
had
explained
my
plans
and
she
was
willing
to
admit
the
possibility
of
success
she
still
felt
doubts
as
to
whether
it
would
be
right
for
her
to
leave
the
country
while
her
friends
were
left
behind
in
danger
i
assured
her
however
that
our
family
would
feel
relieved
to
know
that
we
were
in
safety
and
could
come
back
fresh
and
strong
after
the
war
to
help
in
rebuilding
the
country
having
gained
her
consent
i
still
had
the
difficult
problem
of
ways
and
means
before
me
the
chester
had
orders
to
take
citizens
of
neutral
countries
only
passports
had
to
be
examined
by
the
turkish
authorities
and
by
the
american
who
gave
the
final
permission
to
board
the
cruiser
how
was
i
to
pass
this
double
scrutiny
after
long
and
arduous
search
with
the
assistance
of
several
good
friends
i
at
last
discovered
a
man
who
was
willing
to
sell
me
the
passports
of
a
young
couple
belonging
to
a
neutral
nation
i
can
not
go
into
particulars
about
this
arrangement
of
course
suffice
it
to
say
that
my
sister
was
to
travel
as
my
wife
and
that
we
both
had
to
disguise
ourselves
so
as
to
answer
the
descriptions
on
the
passports
when
i
went
to
the
american
to
get
the
permit
i
found
the
building
crowded
with
people
of
all
nations
spanish
and
greek
and
dutch
and
swiss
all
waiting
for
the
precious
little
papers
that
should
take
them
aboard
the
american
cruiser
that
haven
of
liberty
and
safety
the
chester
was
to
take
all
these
people
to
alexandria
and
those
who
had
the
means
were
to
be
charged
fifty
cents
a
day
for
their
food
from
behind
my
dark
goggles
i
recognized
many
a
person
in
disguise
like
myself
and
seeking
escape
we
never
betrayed
recognition
for
fear
of
the
spies
who
infested
the
place
after
securing
my
permit
i
ran
downstairs
and
straight
to
my
consul
whose
dragoman
i
took
along
with
me
to
the
or
government
building
of
course
the
dragoman
was
well
tipped
and
he
helped
me
considerably
in
hastening
the
examination
i
had
to
undergo
at
the
hands
of
the
turkish
officials
all
went
well
and
i
hurried
back
to
my
sister
triumphant
the
chester
was
to
sail
in
two
days
but
while
we
were
waiting
the
alarming
news
came
that
the
american
consul
had
been
advised
that
the
british
government
refused
to
permit
the
landing
of
the
refugees
in
egypt
and
that
the
departure
of
the
chester
was
indefinitely
postponed
with
a
sinking
at
my
heart
i
rushed
up
to
the
american
consulate
for
details
and
there
learned
that
the
des
moines
was
to
sail
in
a
few
hours
for
rhodes
with
italian
and
greek
refugees
and
that
i
could
go
on
her
if
i
wished
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
my
permit
changed
for
the
trip
on
the
des
moines
and
i
hurried
home
to
my
sister
we
hastily
got
together
the
few
belongings
we
were
to
take
with
us
jumped
into
a
carriage
and
drove
to
the
harbor
we
had
still
another
ordeal
to
go
through
my
sister
was
taken
into
a
private
room
and
thoroughly
searched
so
was
i
nobody
could
leave
the
country
with
more
than
dollars
in
cash
on
his
person
our
baggage
was
carefully
overhauled
no
papers
or
books
could
be
taken
my
sister
bible
was
looked
upon
with
much
suspicion
since
it
contained
a
map
of
ancient
canaan
i
explained
that
this
was
necessary
for
the
orientation
of
our
prayers
and
that
without
it
we
could
not
tell
in
which
direction
to
turn
our
faces
when
praying
this
seemed
plausible
to
the
moslem
examiners
and
saved
the
bible
the
only
book
we
now
possess
as
a
souvenir
from
home
now
our
passports
were
examined
again
and
several
questions
were
asked
my
sister
was
brave
and
cool
and
unconcerned
in
manner
and
at
last
the
final
signature
was
affixed
and
we
jumped
into
the
little
boat
that
was
to
take
us
out
to
the
ship
at
this
moment
a
man
approached
a
dealer
of
whom
my
sister
had
made
some
purchases
a
few
months
before
he
seemed
to
recognize
her
and
he
asked
her
in
german
if
she
were
not
miss
aaronsohn
i
felt
my
blood
leave
my
face
and
looking
him
straight
in
the
eye
i
whispered
if
you
say
one
word
more
you
will
be
a
dead
man
so
help
me
god
he
must
have
felt
that
i
meant
exactly
what
i
said
for
he
walked
off
mumbling
unintelligibly
at
last
the
boat
got
away
and
five
minutes
later
we
were
mounting
the
side
of
the
des
moines
throngs
of
refugees
covered
the
decks
of
the
cruiser
their
faces
showed
tension
and
anxiety
their
presence
there
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
and
all
awaited
the
moment
when
the
ship
should
heave
anchor
a
filipino
sailor
showed
us
about
and
as
he
spoke
italian
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
be
hidden
somewhere
till
the
ship
got
under
way
i
felt
that
even
yet
we
were
not
entirely
safe
that
my
fears
were
justified
i
discovered
shortly
when
from
our
i
saw
the
shopkeeper
approaching
in
a
small
boat
with
a
turkish
officer
they
looked
over
all
the
refugees
on
the
deck
but
searched
for
us
in
vain
after
a
more
of
uncomfortable
tension
the
engines
began
to
sputter
the
propellers
revolved
and
we
were
safe
illustration
beirut
from
the
deck
of
an
outgoing
steamer
the
day
was
dying
and
a
beautiful
twilight
softened
the
outlines
of
the
lebanon
and
the
houses
of
beirut
the
mediterranean
lay
quiet
and
peaceful
around
us
and
the
healthy
sturdy
american
sailors
gave
a
feeling
of
confidence
as
the
cruiser
drew
out
of
the
harbor
a
great
cry
of
farewell
arose
from
the
refugees
on
board
a
cry
in
which
was
mingled
the
relief
of
being
free
anguish
at
leaving
behind
parents
and
friends
fear
and
hope
for
the
future
a
little
later
the
sailors
were
lined
up
in
arms
to
salute
the
american
flag
when
it
was
lowered
for
the
night
moved
by
a
powerful
instinct
of
love
and
respect
all
the
refugees
jumped
to
their
feet
the
men
bareheaded
and
the
women
with
folded
hands
and
in
that
moment
i
understood
as
i
had
never
understood
before
the
real
sacred
meaning
of
a
flag
to
all
those
people
standing
in
awe
about
that
piece
of
cloth
bearing
the
stars
and
stripes
america
was
an
incarnation
of
love
universal
of
freedom
and
salvation
the
cool
syrian
night
our
first
night
on
the
cruiser
was
spent
in
songs
hymns
and
conversation
we
were
all
too
excited
to
sleep
friends
discovered
friends
and
tales
of
woe
were
exchanged
stories
of
hardship
injustice
oppression
all
of
which
ended
with
mutual
congratulations
on
escaping
from
the
clutches
of
the
turks
the
end
